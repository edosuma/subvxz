WEBVTT

00:18.439 --> 00:20.439
Tonight the universe is
no bigger than my head.

00:20.463 --> 00:25.095
It's time to make room
 for some visitors.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.969
So, dio they talk to you?

00:33.993 --> 00:36.710
What, in their own voice
you mean? No.

00:37.991 --> 00:39.991
Well, they...they talk through me.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.084
They speak inside my mind

00:43.599 --> 00:45.599
We're on target.

00:45.624 --> 00:47.624
I can feel them.

00:47.649 --> 00:49.649
Steady...

00:51.658 --> 00:54.328
Sorry about the build up.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.431
I could feel them.
I could...I could hear them inside.

01:01.744 --> 01:03.744
Pretty much on me.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.948
They had this...meeting.

01:06.973 --> 01:08.973
and then they left.

01:10.977 --> 01:12.977
Stay alert.

01:14.049 --> 01:16.049
See if you can get it.

01:16.072 --> 01:17.875
And that was it?

01:17.900 --> 01:19.517
No, that wasn't it.

01:19.739 --> 01:21.869
They left something behind.

01:21.893 --> 01:24.317
Something inside of me that's
been there ever since.

01:24.341 --> 01:27.835
Approaching the house. Stay tight.

01:29.538 --> 01:31.410
When I'm awake, it hurts.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.440
But when I'm...

01:33.465 --> 01:36.730
When I'm not, it
floods me with these

01:36.755 --> 01:38.933
nightmares.

01:39.920 --> 01:42.150
Nightmares, no. Nightmares, it's
not nightmares.

01:42.175 --> 01:45.802
It...it's not a thing, it...
it's a feeling.

01:45.827 --> 01:49.011
It...it's not pain, it's not...
it's not fear.

01:49.035 --> 01:53.572
It...it's something else. It's
something much, much worse.

01:56.330 --> 01:58.330
Go, go. Move.

01:59.589 --> 02:01.589
Go. You hit.

02:02.926 --> 02:05.292
Why don't you take
a few painkillers

02:05.317 --> 02:06.737
before bed, just
knock yourself out?

02:06.818 --> 02:08.818
I've tried everything.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.593
Everything.

02:12.782 --> 02:14.124
Everything?

02:15.983 --> 02:17.983
And it just never works.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.397
No fatigue. Stroke.

02:24.597 --> 02:26.205
Got you.

02:28.369 --> 02:30.925
Please stay tight. Stay tight!

02:34.156 --> 02:36.581
Fuck! What the fuck!

02:36.605 --> 02:38.724
You should get some help.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.732
Oh, I've...

02:42.862 --> 02:44.419
I've seen doctors.

02:44.677 --> 02:48.072
And they say I'm in
peak of physical health.

02:48.103 --> 02:50.989
All I need is a little more sleep.

02:51.059 --> 02:52.740
-What the hell did you do?
-Something was there.

02:52.765 --> 02:53.793
What are you doing?

02:53.818 --> 02:55.660
I saw it, sir. It was
right behind Stevenson.

02:55.684 --> 02:57.130
What the fuck?

02:57.154 --> 02:58.763
So, did you try it?

02:59.503 --> 03:00.788
No.

03:03.873 --> 03:05.702
All I allow myself is a few

03:05.727 --> 03:08.374
hours of sleep every few days.

03:11.707 --> 03:14.408
Go ahead, move! Bring it in!

03:14.433 --> 03:15.586
Target's on you.

03:15.610 --> 03:18.485
Take it! Take it!
Target's on you! Go, go, go!

03:18.510 --> 03:19.766
Pull out! Pull out!

03:19.790 --> 03:21.790
If a doctor tells you to sleep,

03:21.814 --> 03:24.373
maybe you should sleep.
-You don't understand.

03:25.014 --> 03:27.254
There is something inside of
me that...

03:27.278 --> 03:30.405
a comfortable pillow

03:30.429 --> 03:33.145
will not fix!
-Will! I believe you, I do.

03:34.029 --> 03:35.456
I'm making this
film so that other

03:35.481 --> 03:36.688
people will believe you,too.

03:36.712 --> 03:38.789
I don't care if people
believe me or not.

03:38.813 --> 03:42.152
Yes, you do. We've been
discussing it for years.

03:42.176 --> 03:43.053
If you don't care what

03:43.078 --> 03:44.176
other people think,

03:44.199 --> 03:45.452
then what do you want?

03:45.477 --> 03:49.066
I just want someone to
tell me how to make it stop!

03:50.734 --> 03:53.526
How to pull it out
of my head!

03:54.107 --> 03:56.679
I cannot...cannot close
my eyes

03:56.704 --> 03:58.384
for them to tear them out!

03:58.385 --> 03:59.757
Alright, men!

03:59.782 --> 04:01.782
Put a bullet through my head!

04:05.294 --> 04:07.306
I fear that...

04:07.307 --> 04:08.648
that...

04:08.673 --> 04:10.864
The...the...anticipation...

04:10.889 --> 04:13.632
of...of...this feeling...

04:13.656 --> 04:15.656
eats away at my life.

04:16.886 --> 04:18.147
Hold your fire!

04:18.172 --> 04:20.697
I need that man alive,
do you hear me?

04:21.527 --> 04:23.586
Put your goddam gun away, rookie.

04:23.812 --> 04:25.343
Bullets through and through.

04:27.798 --> 04:30.359
But he's alive.

04:32.084 --> 04:33.538
Do you understand?

04:33.749 --> 04:35.749
Tell me what it feels like.
Does it hurt?

04:35.773 --> 04:37.990
It hurts! OK?

04:38.014 --> 04:40.014
It...it hurts.

04:41.795 --> 04:44.888
Do you know how
to follow orders, soldier?

04:44.912 --> 04:47.404
Do you know how
to follow orders?

04:47.428 --> 04:49.960
You almost killed one of
my men in my target.

04:52.256 --> 04:53.468
Copy that.

04:54.648 --> 04:56.648
Don't worry about it, soldier.

05:04.663 --> 05:06.663
This is how we follow orders, soldier.

05:06.687 --> 05:07.748
No!

05:07.772 --> 05:08.866
No!

05:14.841 --> 05:16.383
I've always found it strange

05:16.407 --> 05:17.747
that humans even bother
to

05:17.772 --> 05:19.772
try and imagine the end of the world.

05:21.813 --> 05:23.303
Staging areas,

05:23.327 --> 05:25.327
ships to flee on,

05:25.757 --> 05:28.097
lotteries for tickets
off the planet.

05:29.613 --> 05:31.152
We're all so stupid.

05:32.644 --> 05:35.711
The beginning of the end
as they say.

05:36.445 --> 05:38.907
But that's long
begun by now.

05:39.525 --> 05:41.525
Truth is when it hits,

05:41.549 --> 05:43.452
You will simply cease

05:43.477 --> 05:45.477
to do the stupid little things

05:45.501 --> 05:47.022
that you do.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.047
Just like that.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.875
Ten month...

05:51.900 --> 05:53.657
if it's the big one...

05:53.978 --> 05:56.728
like the sun storm of 1859,

05:56.752 --> 05:58.752
the carrying event

05:58.776 --> 05:59.906
as it's called,

06:00.895 --> 06:03.641
Then there's no
such thing as tomorrow.

06:05.165 --> 06:08.356
She lifts up the sun
like a fiery wing.

06:08.380 --> 06:11.614
It whips back and snaps.
She breaks loose.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.638
Cosmic inferno like a

06:13.663 --> 06:14.810
moveable hell

06:14.834 --> 06:17.815
sprays millions and millions of miles
as if it were nothing.

06:17.839 --> 06:20.346
A cough. A sneeze.

06:21.650 --> 06:23.650
And then, it hits us.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.675
Yes indeed.

06:25.699 --> 06:27.699
It's going to hit us.

06:27.723 --> 06:29.723
And when it hits us,

06:29.747 --> 06:32.372
When it comes crashing through

06:32.396 --> 06:34.396
our flimsy atmosphere,

06:34.420 --> 06:36.420
the good will collapse,

06:36.444 --> 06:39.615
the magnetic poles reverse,

06:39.639 --> 06:41.756
And you know what that means?

06:41.780 --> 06:44.787
The entire surface of the planet

06:44.811 --> 06:47.968
heaves. Its molten heart bursts!

06:47.993 --> 06:52.572
And we all drown in
a lake of eternal fire!

06:55.067 --> 06:57.525
Then we go to Jesus!

07:01.252 --> 07:04.285
Maybe we could just get a
little lecture.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.668
That's all for now, folks.

07:10.872 --> 07:12.872
I have a scar. I'm telling you.

07:12.896 --> 07:16.443
Just show it off and
bang! There it was on the radar.

07:16.467 --> 07:19.931
I don't know, man.
I wouldn't get too excited.

07:19.955 --> 07:23.894
Seen him before.
Ha, ha, ha. As was our cliche.

07:23.919 --> 07:26.783
Opened his eyes. Almost
blew over our head.

07:26.808 --> 07:29.085
Never seen him so
sure of himself.

07:34.859 --> 07:36.311
Sir?

07:37.131 --> 07:39.131
Are you okay?

07:40.099 --> 07:42.099
Can we get you something?

07:46.030 --> 07:47.490
Who are you?

07:49.538 --> 07:50.967
We're the good guys.

07:51.879 --> 07:53.879
We're here to help.

07:54.592 --> 07:56.592
Whose blood is that on your shirt?

07:57.590 --> 07:58.616
Mine.

07:58.617 --> 07:59.927
They shot me.

07:59.952 --> 08:01.952
They shot you because you ran.

08:02.568 --> 08:04.569
Bad things happen when you disobey.

08:04.594 --> 08:06.139
It's best if you
 learn that now.

08:06.982 --> 08:08.443
Let me go.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.467
Sit still and let's talk.

08:11.589 --> 08:12.991
We lost a rookie tonight.

08:13.015 --> 08:14.699
He was a good kid.

08:14.723 --> 08:16.723
I don't know about you,

08:16.747 --> 08:18.321
but we want to end
the bloodshed.

08:18.346 --> 08:19.192
-And you can help us

08:19.216 --> 08:21.723
by giving us some answers.
-I don't know anything.

08:21.747 --> 08:23.152
Oh, come now,
that's not true.

08:23.176 --> 08:25.176
What about...

08:25.200 --> 08:27.200
the planets in our solar system?

08:27.224 --> 08:29.403
I'm sure you know those.

08:30.129 --> 08:32.676
-Mars...
-Saturn. Thank you, agent.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.323
I have a feeling he's aware. Now.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.683
I'm curious

08:39.707 --> 08:41.707
what he knows about
things from

08:42.779 --> 08:44.931
a little further away.

08:44.955 --> 08:46.173
Let me go!

08:50.466 --> 08:52.974
-Let me go!
-You need to calm down!

08:53.279 --> 08:55.795
Just...relax.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.743
I told you...

09:01.788 --> 09:03.788
to sit still, old man.

09:04.632 --> 09:06.632
And you don't listen very well, do you

09:06.657 --> 09:08.250
spider Nevi?

09:10.000 --> 09:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:32.436 --> 09:35.082
Please have Heather
prep the prep helmet.

09:38.332 --> 09:40.332
Now! Please and thank you.

10:00.811 --> 10:03.651
William Cassidy. I
must apologize.

10:04.863 --> 10:06.643
William Cassidy is our guest...

10:06.667 --> 10:08.385
He's part of our team.

10:11.830 --> 10:13.830
You know, you look a little bit rough.

10:14.595 --> 10:16.595
I have to admit. But I

10:16.629 --> 10:18.629
I did not expect that you
 would look quite so old.

10:22.824 --> 10:26.029
Might be time to update the
profile picture on your website.

10:31.677 --> 10:33.270
William, I would like
you and I

10:33.295 --> 10:35.317
to hit the reset button right now.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.625
I want to like you and
I want you to like me.

10:38.650 --> 10:41.392
I'm a firm believer in
straightforward conversation.

10:42.337 --> 10:45.259
If you and I would have
a straightforward conversation

10:45.284 --> 10:47.012
between friends,

10:47.395 --> 10:48.524
then we'll have a

10:48.549 --> 10:50.036
wonderful outcome today.

10:51.559 --> 10:52.934
It's so easy.

10:52.958 --> 10:54.197
Don't you agree?

10:57.041 --> 10:59.335
I will assume that you agree,

10:59.359 --> 11:01.546
and that you're not
 being difficult right now

11:01.993 --> 11:06.305
So, let's start with
 a very easy question.

11:07.508 --> 11:09.313
What happened last night?

11:11.602 --> 11:14.283
I'm going to ask you
a few questions on camera, OK?

11:14.922 --> 11:16.307
Is that all?

11:17.271 --> 11:18.463
Yeah.

11:21.606 --> 11:23.118
OK? Yeah.

11:24.104 --> 11:26.813
So sorry about the confusion
before, but

11:26.837 --> 11:28.656
Can I ask you

11:29.828 --> 11:31.601
if my name rings a bell
at all?

11:34.443 --> 11:35.742
Why? What is it again?

11:36.427 --> 11:37.427
Joe.

11:37.879 --> 11:38.965
Joe Sullivan?

11:38.990 --> 11:40.990
I got an email
from you the other night.

11:43.718 --> 11:44.740
No.

11:51.201 --> 11:54.017
I never give out...
personal information online ever.

11:56.477 --> 11:57.619
OK.

12:00.962 --> 12:02.055
I'm here with...

12:02.079 --> 12:03.518
Bill Cassidy.

12:05.690 --> 12:06.754
Let me just say that

12:06.779 --> 12:08.733
I have been following
your story for years.

12:09.410 --> 12:10.944
And I'm doing a documentary.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.452
Extra-Terrestrial activity.

12:14.476 --> 12:17.299
Things...beyond our atmosphere.

12:19.158 --> 12:21.158
So, it's obviously
a pleasure to meet you.

12:24.185 --> 12:25.721
Yeah...Uh...

12:25.904 --> 12:28.336
So the first question is:
You were abducted by

12:28.361 --> 12:29.912
aliens thirty-nine years ago?

12:34.091 --> 12:35.513
I never said abducted.

12:38.122 --> 12:40.491
Something came to me.

12:42.461 --> 12:44.812
OK, good, That's what I want.

12:44.836 --> 12:46.836
I want to hear what
happened in your own words.

12:48.530 --> 12:49.727
My own words?

12:55.982 --> 12:57.462
I met

12:58.593 --> 13:00.674
an advanced

13:00.951 --> 13:02.038
life

13:02.062 --> 13:06.326
form...from somewhere else.

13:09.676 --> 13:11.365
You met them. What
does that mean?

13:13.039 --> 13:14.123
They came here

13:15.717 --> 13:17.717
through the front door,
just like you.

13:19.419 --> 13:20.679
And you just let them in?

13:21.171 --> 13:22.296
No.

13:26.644 --> 13:28.187
I didn't have much choice.

13:31.427 --> 13:32.554
They threatened you?

13:33.638 --> 13:34.702
No.

13:39.453 --> 13:40.976
They control me.

13:47.434 --> 13:48.766
So, what did they look like?

14:14.089 --> 14:15.397
Hit William hard.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.753
Please.

14:24.181 --> 14:25.706
That's it, agent.

14:25.730 --> 14:26.987
Thank you!

14:28.494 --> 14:30.142
I'm sorry, William.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.717
Sometimes you really have
to hit that reset button.

14:38.038 --> 14:39.795
Now that you are clear

14:39.819 --> 14:42.327
on what our expectations are,
you should accept them.

14:43.006 --> 14:45.006
On the one hand,
you could disclose the

14:45.030 --> 14:47.030
events of the twelve
hours or so,

14:47.653 --> 14:49.054
And on the other hand,

14:49.079 --> 14:52.324
just not really hand at all, it's
more of a toolbox

14:53.082 --> 14:54.457
of devices

14:56.402 --> 14:59.746
that you really never
want to have to see.

15:03.192 --> 15:06.031
Tell me everything
you know, William.

15:09.847 --> 15:11.296
I know all of you people.

15:13.824 --> 15:15.054
Strange, William.

15:15.078 --> 15:17.703
Very, very strange
you with your

15:17.727 --> 15:19.203
history.

15:19.832 --> 15:22.398
You've been staring
at the sky

15:22.496 --> 15:24.422
for decades now.

15:24.938 --> 15:26.542
Posting your theories online?

15:26.567 --> 15:28.668
Unbelievable ideas,
some would say.

15:31.012 --> 15:34.463
We've had our eye on you
most of your life, now.

15:36.163 --> 15:39.476
Sorry. No autographs today.

15:44.859 --> 15:47.316
Last night, there was a
coronal mass injection.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.210
You know about it. You were
a part of it. Historic.

15:52.866 --> 15:54.866
Bigger than the Carrington event.

15:55.673 --> 15:57.031
This is kidnapping.

15:57.406 --> 15:59.634
It knocked something
out of the sky. Didn't it, William?

16:01.954 --> 16:03.279
Do you want to know what I

16:03.304 --> 16:04.591
can't get my head around?

16:05.841 --> 16:08.611
There are so many
people out there just like yourself,

16:08.636 --> 16:10.636
Colorful folks, just like you,

16:11.808 --> 16:15.302
who have knowledge of
or had experience with visitors.

16:17.114 --> 16:19.757
Yours was what?
Thirty-nine years ago?

16:20.726 --> 16:24.254
How wonderfully vindicating
it must be for you...

16:24.278 --> 16:27.824
to have one crash in
your backyard just last night!

16:27.848 --> 16:30.114
Or is that just too
much coincidence

16:30.139 --> 16:32.457
for your weak little
story to pair?

16:33.246 --> 16:35.246
It's separate.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.252
You find it funny
they're hitting me.

16:46.432 --> 16:48.432
Squaring with the enemy.

16:53.675 --> 16:56.041
Over the years it's
gotten more drastic.

16:56.752 --> 16:59.649
Usually I just wake
up in bed screaming.

17:01.751 --> 17:03.751
Sometimes, I wake up
in other places.

17:05.356 --> 17:06.837
Yeah? Like where?

17:07.531 --> 17:11.694
In front of the computer, staring
at sites I've never heard of.

17:12.546 --> 17:14.015
Sometimes outside.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.515
I've woken up walking
down the highway.

17:19.849 --> 17:21.849
I've woken up floating on water.

17:23.732 --> 17:25.567
No shorts...I...

17:28.631 --> 17:30.696
I woke up two states over.

17:32.555 --> 17:35.414
Two weeks had passed.
I had no idea how I got there.

17:35.438 --> 17:37.438
It had been erased from my memory.

17:40.774 --> 17:42.774
Once, I woke up in a field

17:44.139 --> 17:45.446
fifteen miles from here.

17:48.283 --> 17:49.642
I was covered in blood.

17:51.619 --> 17:53.072
There was a horse

17:54.817 --> 17:56.158
on the ground in front of me.

17:56.926 --> 18:00.332
It...it...had...been cut

18:01.255 --> 18:02.574
down the center.

18:03.287 --> 18:04.801
Its insides

18:05.135 --> 18:06.903
removed and laid out

18:06.927 --> 18:08.927
and displayed in the grass

18:10.028 --> 18:12.202
like an internal...road map.

18:15.132 --> 18:17.470
Why don't we talk
about something else for a second?

18:19.033 --> 18:20.360
Like...

18:21.610 --> 18:23.610
tonight's mass ejection.

18:24.946 --> 18:26.946
Yeah, it should...should
be interesting.

18:28.385 --> 18:29.493
Yeah...

18:29.924 --> 18:31.245
Solar flares in.

18:31.270 --> 18:34.275
traveled millions of miles here and burst
through our atmosphere tonight.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.488
Yeah.

18:35.899 --> 18:38.876
There's nothing else here
that should be interesting on the ship.

18:39.555 --> 18:41.657
They say it's going to
interfere with the whole grid.

18:41.681 --> 18:43.196
World-wide blackout.

18:44.032 --> 18:45.415
Grounded all the flights.

18:45.439 --> 18:46.782
Systems...

18:47.204 --> 18:49.204
...might get knocked out
of the sky.

18:50.287 --> 18:52.095
All the transit's been shut down.

18:53.302 --> 18:54.744
I look forward to it.

18:57.158 --> 18:59.432
Nature has a way of
mixing things up.

19:02.611 --> 19:04.965
Humans really are
not in control.

19:19.684 --> 19:21.684
We'd like you to hook
up the platform.

19:21.864 --> 19:24.577
Let's put a couple of
holes into William's head.

19:24.601 --> 19:26.201
And see what we see.

19:33.494 --> 19:35.494
You want to know
 more about it?

19:39.881 --> 19:40.954
No?

19:40.978 --> 19:42.171
Well, it's too bad.

19:42.484 --> 19:45.281
It's less destructive if
you know what to expect.

19:50.124 --> 19:51.992
Is that comfortable?
-Heather!

19:52.661 --> 19:54.016
Please don't do that.

19:55.796 --> 19:58.377
It's just...when our subjects
are more comfortable,

19:58.402 --> 19:59.990
we actually get better results.

20:00.014 --> 20:03.161
Just...stop talking.

20:03.186 --> 20:05.339
And finish.

20:05.363 --> 20:06.690
Yes, Doctor.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.537
Doctor, we got something.

20:25.459 --> 20:27.142
It's about time!

20:27.526 --> 20:29.274
What I got here?

20:29.299 --> 20:31.156
equals square circle.

20:31.181 --> 20:33.181
It appears we have an abandoned truck.

20:33.205 --> 20:35.096
The back of the truck is clear.

20:35.121 --> 20:36.939
The truck is clear.
-Copy that.

20:37.721 --> 20:38.775
Some blood.

20:40.369 --> 20:41.470
Something else.

20:45.659 --> 20:48.132
Protecting...

20:48.157 --> 20:50.157
You know what we're
looking at here, William?

20:51.852 --> 20:53.852
I've made this truck.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.626
Hey, your insides seem valuable.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.644
Must be your pest
helmet, doc.

21:03.941 --> 21:05.941
I'm seeing a bunch of blood.

21:13.134 --> 21:14.376
Doctor?

21:15.314 --> 21:16.759
You're gonna want
to see this.

21:17.883 --> 21:19.079
OK, bring it in.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.422
Copy that.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.954
There's a substance here.

21:23.306 --> 21:24.689
What is it?

21:25.453 --> 21:26.689
Definitely foreign.

21:27.697 --> 21:28.822
Sir?

21:32.251 --> 21:33.385
It's not human.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.072
Care to tell me what
you know about this truck, Bill?

21:44.639 --> 21:45.705
No.

21:46.231 --> 21:49.431
So, you might feel a
little sting here.

21:49.456 --> 21:52.341
That's not really a sting.
Kind of...kind of like a

21:52.365 --> 21:55.630
hot blade slowly digging around
in your head.

21:55.654 --> 21:57.113
What is this thing?

21:57.137 --> 21:59.996
Oh! So now you're interested.

22:03.319 --> 22:06.316
It pulls your thoughts
out of your mind.

22:06.340 --> 22:09.358
No, we don't really know
how it actually works,

22:09.383 --> 22:12.211
we usually get the results
we're looking for.

22:12.235 --> 22:13.774
Unfortunately,there's some

22:13.799 --> 22:16.403
undesirable side effects
for the subjects.

22:17.499 --> 22:20.192
You know, it took a
hundred years before

22:20.217 --> 22:22.647
anybody could figure out
how to turn it on.

22:23.437 --> 22:24.796
Isn't that interesting?

22:27.903 --> 22:29.616
What happened last night, Bill?

22:37.379 --> 22:38.762
That's a funny one.

22:41.587 --> 22:43.587
Can I have some more, please?

22:48.586 --> 22:50.620
Did I tell you that we
have figured out

22:50.645 --> 22:52.602
how it pulls your mind out
of your head

22:52.669 --> 22:55.782
but we have no idea
how to put it back in?

22:57.136 --> 22:58.343
They're so...

22:58.368 --> 23:00.368
Give me some more juice.

23:02.739 --> 23:04.415
Keep at it, girl!
Turn it up!

23:45.516 --> 23:47.140
Turn it off!

23:51.264 --> 23:52.453
Check her!

23:54.836 --> 23:56.836
What the fuck
just happened here?

24:01.908 --> 24:03.633
Take that off.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.039
You crazy?

24:23.001 --> 24:24.102
Good?

24:24.834 --> 24:28.099
Please take that device
off of your friend's head.

24:28.494 --> 24:29.509
Now.

25:02.856 --> 25:04.856
I order you.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.332
Get rid of her!

25:17.636 --> 25:19.636
Is that the camera, soldier?
Bring it in.

25:19.660 --> 25:20.930
Put it on the monitor.

25:27.451 --> 25:28.643
Thank you, soldier.

25:35.268 --> 25:36.529
Hey, everybody.

25:36.554 --> 25:38.308
Joe Sullivan here.

25:38.331 --> 25:40.331
Sully_5433

25:40.355 --> 25:42.576
I just got the most
 amazing email last night.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.972
While I was sleeping,

25:43.995 --> 25:46.221
I got contacted by a god.

25:46.246 --> 25:48.037
OK? Hello Joe Sullivan.

25:48.062 --> 25:50.804
I would like you to come
meet me at the address below tomorrow.

25:50.827 --> 25:52.827
Spider Nevi. Spider Nevi...

25:52.851 --> 25:54.851
He's the whale of astronomy.

25:55.546 --> 25:57.687
People have been trying to
 find this guy for years.

25:57.711 --> 25:59.212
But he doesn't want
to be found.

25:59.236 --> 26:01.236
He's off the radar, he's off
the grid,

26:01.260 --> 26:02.969
not even the government
knows where he is.

26:03.984 --> 26:06.305
He contacted me.

26:06.329 --> 26:09.782
Maybe...maybe he wants
me to film him.

26:09.806 --> 26:11.027
Maybe he wants to talk about

26:11.052 --> 26:12.247
the mass ejections tonight.

26:12.272 --> 26:15.240
I mean, There are some crazy
shit going on in the atmosphere

26:15.265 --> 26:16.724
and he decides to contact me?

26:16.748 --> 26:18.801
I mean, this guy's been blogging

26:18.826 --> 26:20.591
about an alien
experience for years,

26:20.615 --> 26:22.455
the things that he's
writing about, the

26:22.480 --> 26:25.241
concepts and the ideas,
they're just so...

26:27.272 --> 26:29.186
Anyway...I'm backed up.

26:29.211 --> 26:30.827
I'm going to need the help. Let's go.

26:51.904 --> 26:54.654
That's where we're going.
Right over that ridge.

26:54.678 --> 26:56.607
I've got zero idea if
 this is anywhere close

26:56.632 --> 26:58.674
to real or a total scam.

26:58.699 --> 27:00.070
All we know is what
this guy looks

27:00.095 --> 27:01.565
like and that he
goes by Spider-man

27:01.589 --> 27:04.190
Fuck. That sounds made up.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.346
Not sure what to make of this.

27:08.213 --> 27:09.698
What the hell?

27:11.589 --> 27:13.589
Jesus...the tanks...?

27:14.672 --> 27:16.672
I wonder if we can get closer?

27:29.284 --> 27:30.757
Howdy.

27:32.486 --> 27:33.710
Hi sir.

27:34.408 --> 27:35.867
My name is Joe Sullivan.

27:35.891 --> 27:37.891
Hi, Joe. Is that a camera?

27:39.297 --> 27:41.297
Uh? -Yeah.
Are you filming me right now?

27:41.320 --> 27:43.058
-No sir.
-I don't believe you.

27:43.083 --> 27:44.506
You're a liar. Why
you got a camera

27:44.531 --> 27:45.793
sitting there pointing at me?

27:45.818 --> 27:48.504
-I'm making a film. Uh...
-Oh, you're making a movie.

27:48.529 --> 27:49.542
I am, sir.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.104
You think there are
some interesting

27:51.129 --> 27:52.504
people up here, aren't there?

27:54.396 --> 27:55.801
Go fuck yourself today.

27:59.351 --> 28:00.575
What about tomorrow?

28:02.506 --> 28:04.371
Hi. Hi there.

28:04.491 --> 28:06.396
My name is...Joe.

28:07.944 --> 28:09.764
Hey! I'm Joe Sullivan.

28:11.651 --> 28:12.686
How you doin'?

28:15.119 --> 28:16.186
Hello.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.530
My name is Joseph Sullivan.

28:18.554 --> 28:19.927
Filmmaker.

28:19.950 --> 28:21.332
Astronomer.

28:21.357 --> 28:22.880
It's really stupid.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.443
Alright. Here we go.

28:34.486 --> 28:35.779
This is perfect.

28:39.808 --> 28:40.889
Hello?

28:41.824 --> 28:42.913
Hello!

28:45.178 --> 28:46.351
Anybody here?

28:50.843 --> 28:53.382
He's coming...Jesus!

28:56.064 --> 28:57.523
Oh.

28:58.009 --> 28:59.547
Hey. Ha.

28:59.548 --> 29:01.076
You...just...

29:01.101 --> 29:02.321
snuck up on me there.

29:05.470 --> 29:07.470
Hi, I'm...I'm Joe.

29:10.117 --> 29:11.384
It's...

29:13.841 --> 29:15.096
Uh...

29:17.163 --> 29:18.775
Joe Sullivan. You...

29:19.585 --> 29:21.079
You sent me an...

29:21.103 --> 29:22.632
...email last night?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
Uh...you're Spider Nevy?

29:29.014 --> 29:30.133
Um...

29:30.157 --> 29:32.340
Listen, I...I just...

29:32.365 --> 29:34.335
want to talk to you
for a few minutes

29:36.886 --> 29:38.206
on camera if...if...

29:40.430 --> 29:41.578
Uh, I'm not going to

29:41.603 --> 29:43.386
take up too much of
your time, I just...

29:44.985 --> 29:46.883
I assume you want
to tell your story.

29:46.908 --> 29:48.751
You know, I'm a filmmaker, I'm not

29:49.601 --> 29:52.789
I'm not some weirdo.
I have read everything you've written...

29:53.371 --> 29:55.621
...I've watched everything you
have posted online...

29:55.645 --> 29:57.645
...And I believe your story
and I

29:57.669 --> 29:59.578
and I'm not here to debunk

29:59.602 --> 30:01.602
I'm not here to make fun
of you or

30:02.141 --> 30:04.141
eh...you know.

30:06.352 --> 30:08.352
Um...I'm here to...

30:08.376 --> 30:11.599
listen...that's...that's all
I'm here to do.

30:16.130 --> 30:18.992
I mean,hey...if this isn't
a good time, I can always

30:19.729 --> 30:21.195
I can always come back or...

30:21.219 --> 30:22.916
you know, we can just...

30:22.940 --> 30:24.940
you can give me one of
those beers and...

30:26.437 --> 30:27.997
We don't even have
to talk on camera or

30:28.022 --> 30:29.872
anything like that. I can
just put it down and

30:29.985 --> 30:31.492
just talk.

30:39.830 --> 30:41.283
Oh...

30:44.785 --> 30:46.816
No...no...no...

30:46.840 --> 30:48.840
No...no...

31:31.655 --> 31:33.655
Aah!

31:42.991 --> 31:44.556
Fascinating.

31:45.511 --> 31:47.192
Completely.

31:47.217 --> 31:48.822
Fascinating.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.880
I have put that

31:52.905 --> 31:54.905
on hundreds of people.

31:54.930 --> 31:58.961
And there is never
anything left, any, nothing.

32:02.934 --> 32:04.336
But William...

32:05.286 --> 32:07.922
There's still plenty
of you in there isn't there?

32:09.054 --> 32:10.774
Something's different.

32:12.016 --> 32:15.249
It is? What? What's different?

32:15.444 --> 32:17.444
It's changed.

32:18.421 --> 32:20.421
It's stronger.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.445
More vicious.

32:24.463 --> 32:25.719
I'm sorry.

32:26.852 --> 32:29.304
I'm sorry. I don't
want to see you in pain.

32:31.545 --> 32:33.467
You and I, Bill,

32:35.570 --> 32:36.959
we share a mission.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.413
I'm not going to have a mission.
-Yeah.

32:39.437 --> 32:41.342
Yes, you do.

32:41.367 --> 32:43.881
Oh, but you do have a mission.

32:43.905 --> 32:47.090
That same creature that contacted you

32:47.114 --> 32:49.372
contacted us. Do you know when, Bill?

32:49.396 --> 32:53.989
One thousand three hundred
and sixty-five years ago.

32:54.489 --> 32:59.123
And we have been trying
to return the call ever since.

33:00.538 --> 33:02.538
We can help each other.

33:03.114 --> 33:04.562
Then...

33:04.586 --> 33:07.486
we can help you
find the proof that you need.

33:07.510 --> 33:11.970
I don't need anybody to find proof.

33:13.376 --> 33:15.633
I just want it to stop.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.524
I know, I know,

33:18.548 --> 33:21.488
I understand. We
can help you.

33:23.309 --> 33:25.309
Where is it, Bill?

33:27.263 --> 33:28.911
Is it with Joe Sullivan?

33:29.779 --> 33:31.779
It's not with anybody.

33:34.083 --> 33:35.521
OK.

33:35.553 --> 33:38.177
Come on. Come
on, William.

33:38.841 --> 33:41.275
I feel like I'm being
much more honest

33:41.300 --> 33:43.578
with you than you are
with me right now.

33:43.602 --> 33:45.602
He'll hurt anybody.

33:46.369 --> 33:48.078
Erase anybody.

34:05.019 --> 34:07.483
So, Bill, what are we
going to see out here tonight?

34:08.286 --> 34:10.022
Fluctuations in the sky.

34:10.413 --> 34:14.179
Colors are ripples as it
bursts through the sky's atmosphere.

34:14.734 --> 34:17.943
This energy is traveling
1,500 miles a second.

34:17.967 --> 34:21.920
and almost 500 million
miles to get to us, and when it hits,

34:21.945 --> 34:24.347
Ugh. Ugh..

34:24.371 --> 34:25.400
Bill?

34:25.400 --> 34:26.501
Ugh.

34:26.525 --> 34:27.663
Bill, are you alright?

34:27.687 --> 34:29.687
Ugh,- there is something
out there. -Ugh,

34:30.190 --> 34:31.402
I think it...

34:32.527 --> 34:34.090
Oh, my God, Bill, look.

34:35.228 --> 34:37.840
Oh! Look. Look at it, Bill.

34:38.527 --> 34:42.219
Look. Seriously.
What's happening, Bill?

34:52.034 --> 34:53.518
What's happened?

34:53.822 --> 34:56.393
-They're here. I can feel them.
Who's here?

34:57.394 --> 34:59.728
Bill, who's here?

35:00.097 --> 35:02.409
They found me. And
they've come back.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.610
What are you saying?
-Look. Look. You see?

35:05.635 --> 35:08.416
Don't you see?
-Please, just tell me.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.584
Tell me what I'm
looking at here.

35:10.608 --> 35:13.920
Look...I told you.

35:13.944 --> 35:16.504
They didn't believe me.

35:22.406 --> 35:24.139
Platoon. It's coming.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.381
Look. Come on.

35:25.406 --> 35:29.229
Up there. It's...It's...
Follow, follow me, follow.

35:29.254 --> 35:31.254
Look.

35:41.904 --> 35:42.999
No.

35:45.631 --> 35:47.452
No! Bill, don't.

35:47.452 --> 35:49.452
Bill.

35:49.477 --> 35:50.836
-Bill...
-Shh!

35:50.861 --> 35:52.085
Bill, wait!

35:52.806 --> 35:53.884
Wait!

35:55.313 --> 35:56.492
Wait!

35:56.517 --> 35:59.698
Wait. Wait.
Bill, I don't know where I'm going.

36:01.350 --> 36:02.558
Bill...

36:02.559 --> 36:04.231
Shit!

36:04.256 --> 36:05.350
Joe!

36:06.268 --> 36:07.496
Over here!

36:38.866 --> 36:40.020
Hang on, Bill.

36:43.467 --> 36:44.958
My God!

36:46.537 --> 36:47.771
Look at this!

37:10.428 --> 37:11.701
Oh...

37:12.453 --> 37:14.760
Look! Over here, too.

37:14.784 --> 37:15.953
My God!

37:19.384 --> 37:20.452
Oh...

38:04.683 --> 38:07.583
Oh, my God!

38:13.841 --> 38:15.934
Don't get too close, Bill.

38:23.660 --> 38:24.825
Oh...

38:35.695 --> 38:36.806
Bill!

38:37.880 --> 38:39.032
Run.

38:39.056 --> 38:40.234
Run!

38:41.031 --> 38:42.476
Bill! Bill!

38:43.234 --> 38:44.500
Shit!

38:52.967 --> 38:54.826
Bill, I need you to tell me

38:54.850 --> 38:58.230
what it is we are
 looking at here.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.769
What do you think
you are looking at?

39:02.364 --> 39:05.856
William, I'm going to
ask you one more time.

39:08.255 --> 39:10.255
Tell me what it is
that you found there.

39:20.105 --> 39:22.229
Is this some sort of
game you're playing

39:22.254 --> 39:24.067
to get people to
believe your story?

39:25.872 --> 39:27.872
Spray paint, cardboard,

39:28.082 --> 39:30.012
camera tricks, and
post on-line for your

39:30.037 --> 39:31.966
conspiracy buddies.
is that what this is?

39:32.684 --> 39:35.661
Or are we looking at something
significant here?

39:35.662 --> 39:36.671
Yeah.

39:37.626 --> 39:39.286
It's significant.

39:40.683 --> 39:43.730
If you are fucking with me

39:43.754 --> 39:45.446
I will make sure you
leave this building

39:45.471 --> 39:48.885
cut up into a thousand pieces,
burned and pissed on.

39:52.091 --> 39:54.681
I haven't much option
here. Sounds like I'm losing.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.432
All units...

40:17.457 --> 40:19.905
we have significant evidence
to indicate that

40:19.929 --> 40:22.071
an unidentified flying object has

40:22.096 --> 40:26.567
split apart in our atmosphere and
crashed onto Cassidy's property.

40:29.591 --> 40:31.607
A small pod has landed in the

40:31.632 --> 40:34.482
forest and the main
unit is in the pod.

40:36.174 --> 40:37.763
Find me this ship.

40:44.091 --> 40:46.091
We're going to fucking die
out here.

40:46.115 --> 40:48.855
Shut your mouth, soldier.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.551
Move quickly and quietly.

41:02.284 --> 41:04.284
Appears to be a...substance

41:06.300 --> 41:08.876
similar to what we saw at the truck.
-OK, sample it for the lab.

41:09.603 --> 41:10.900
We got something.

41:13.587 --> 41:15.587
The impact is obvious.

41:17.432 --> 41:19.220
Seven touchdown.

41:20.197 --> 41:22.564
So that's it? That's the
second crash site.

41:22.588 --> 41:25.687
Find the pod.
-Surrounding area is burnt.

41:26.148 --> 41:27.711
There's nothing left.

41:28.460 --> 41:29.735
There's no ship.

41:29.759 --> 41:31.372
No pod. Nothing.

41:33.466 --> 41:37.278
You see what we see? There's nothing
here. I repeat, nothing is here.

41:38.605 --> 41:40.028
We need to move on.

41:40.502 --> 41:42.330
No, that's...that's the right site.

41:42.355 --> 41:43.901
Doctor, there is no fucking ship.

41:43.925 --> 41:46.776
Something must have come and gone.
Open your god damned eyes.

41:46.811 --> 41:48.811
Ah!

41:49.664 --> 41:51.518
Bill?

41:54.039 --> 41:55.416
Bill!

41:56.281 --> 41:57.617
Oh,Jesus!

41:57.618 --> 41:59.295
No yelling.

41:59.320 --> 42:02.695
Oh, God. Sorry.

42:04.109 --> 42:06.109
Oh, let's see whats happening

42:08.545 --> 42:10.248
There's something out there.

42:10.273 --> 42:12.273
You're fucking...what?

42:12.297 --> 42:14.925
I see...I see it.

42:17.566 --> 42:19.011
What is it, Bill?

42:19.739 --> 42:21.035
Bill?

42:21.985 --> 42:23.192
Bill, what is it?

42:25.568 --> 42:26.675
Look!

42:26.700 --> 42:28.700
Shh...Bill!

42:28.724 --> 42:29.905
Wait!

42:29.930 --> 42:31.201
Bill!

42:31.224 --> 42:32.239
Bill!

42:37.377 --> 42:38.512
It's erased.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.309
Bill...

43:02.130 --> 43:04.130
No...No...

43:06.383 --> 43:07.740
What the fuck is that?

43:09.756 --> 43:11.756
I'm gonna shit my pants, man.

43:11.780 --> 43:13.414
What the fuck was that?

43:18.479 --> 43:19.758
Did you see it?

43:30.628 --> 43:31.771
I don't know, Joe.

43:45.742 --> 43:47.742
Bill, Bill, wait!

43:47.767 --> 43:48.447
Wait, wait!

43:48.472 --> 43:50.512
-I knew you had a
goddamned camera.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.212
Bill?

44:02.942 --> 44:04.174
Ah!

44:11.902 --> 44:13.148
Ah!

44:20.289 --> 44:21.612
Bill!

44:24.798 --> 44:26.206
Bill!

44:34.602 --> 44:35.868
Bill!

44:40.292 --> 44:43.461
Move...fucking move. Shit!

45:05.750 --> 45:07.360
Oh, fuck. Move!

45:07.385 --> 45:08.885
I don't want to die.

45:08.909 --> 45:11.376
Fuck! Oh, shit!

45:11.400 --> 45:13.400
Oh...Ah...

45:13.587 --> 45:15.587
Where...where am
I going?

45:15.611 --> 45:17.116
Where am I going? Fuck.

45:17.140 --> 45:19.140
What the...?

45:19.853 --> 45:21.164
Ow!

45:28.728 --> 45:30.728
Shit! The light!

45:35.752 --> 45:38.334
Oh, oh, fuck.
What is this?

45:38.358 --> 45:39.646
What the...what the fuck?

45:41.687 --> 45:42.968
Things are about to get

45:42.993 --> 45:44.108
very nasty right now.

45:56.177 --> 45:59.226
We don't really know
what they were originally designed for

45:59.250 --> 46:03.406
All I know, is that they
cause immense pain.

46:04.781 --> 46:07.758
And shut off your body's
coping mechanism.

46:09.149 --> 46:11.258
Your body's designed
to shut off.

46:11.945 --> 46:13.945
But with the D-83 shackles,

46:15.282 --> 46:17.282
It keeps the pain switch
turned on.

46:28.067 --> 46:29.476
It's your last chance.

46:29.500 --> 46:31.591
Where is that ship?

46:40.614 --> 46:41.763
Turn it on!

46:46.799 --> 46:49.214
Yeah, you want to
tell me where the ship is now, Bill?

46:52.928 --> 46:54.408
You had enough now?

46:59.266 --> 47:00.293
Hey, you want more?

47:04.285 --> 47:06.285
Come on, Agent! Turn it
up! Give him more!

47:13.528 --> 47:20.558
Ahh! Ahh! Ahhh!
Ahhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh

47:31.924 --> 47:34.433
You're gonna need more
power than that!

47:50.928 --> 47:52.064
Hey!

47:56.234 --> 47:57.288
Bill?

47:58.078 --> 47:59.312
Bill?

47:59.969 --> 48:01.094
Bill, come on.

48:01.119 --> 48:02.227
Is it out there?

48:02.251 --> 48:04.031
Oh, please don't be out there.

48:04.055 --> 48:05.443
Oh, fuck.

48:05.467 --> 48:07.177
Oh, shit.

48:07.560 --> 48:09.560
Weird. Oh. Oh.

48:09.583 --> 48:11.583
I'll just...I'll just...

48:11.608 --> 48:15.881
OK, OK, OK. OK. Ok.

48:17.374 --> 48:18.757
That's just me.

48:19.466 --> 48:20.781
It's fine.

48:25.044 --> 48:26.656
Oh, fuck! Oh, God!

48:33.213 --> 48:35.218
Why are running?
You running away?

48:35.242 --> 48:36.862
Gotta get way back to the cam.

48:38.911 --> 48:40.518
Up the stairs.

48:40.542 --> 48:42.542
Shit! get the door!

48:47.299 --> 48:48.348
That's not enough!

48:49.362 --> 48:50.372
Oh, shit.

49:01.799 --> 49:03.482
Bill? Bill!

49:04.092 --> 49:05.506
Take the camera!

49:10.499 --> 49:12.499
-Look!
-The shelf!

49:20.672 --> 49:21.887
The noise.

49:23.278 --> 49:25.278
Bill, what's that on
the fucking roof?

49:27.653 --> 49:29.652
Bill, how did they get on
the roof?

49:30.352 --> 49:31.677
Oh, fuck!

49:39.111 --> 49:41.360
Son of a bitch!

49:59.462 --> 50:01.999
It's back. At the car site.

50:02.023 --> 50:04.023
Back up, back up!

50:04.047 --> 50:06.047
Ahhhhhh!

50:06.072 --> 50:08.072
Ah! Ah!

50:10.208 --> 50:11.284
You can do it.

50:11.308 --> 50:12.614
Stevens!

50:12.637 --> 50:14.479
Ok, what happened, soldier?
I lost my feed.

50:14.504 --> 50:16.662
Something grabbed Stevens
at the grid.

50:16.686 --> 50:18.686
Stevens!!!!

50:18.710 --> 50:20.710
Anybody got eyes on him?

50:20.734 --> 50:23.410
Go ahead into his last location.

50:23.434 --> 50:24.879
Did he say what he saw?

50:24.903 --> 50:28.388
Negative. All we heard was
too fucked up sound, then silence.

50:29.185 --> 50:32.224
It ain't human. It's got to
be extra-terrestrial.

50:32.248 --> 50:34.248
Stevens!!

50:34.272 --> 50:37.973
Stay close. keep your
eyes open.

50:37.997 --> 50:40.309
Stevens! Stevens.

50:40.333 --> 50:42.333
Stevens. Stevens!

50:52.197 --> 50:54.197
Got a bunch of them live.

50:56.247 --> 50:57.767
Stevens is gone.

50:59.630 --> 51:00.947
Fuck!

51:01.661 --> 51:02.971
Tracks.

51:06.812 --> 51:08.812
That side...

51:12.213 --> 51:13.508
Both of you.

51:16.074 --> 51:18.827
Ok, keep following. I want
you to find something,

51:19.472 --> 51:20.528
 Find some answers here.

51:37.117 --> 51:38.463
Nothing for a while.

51:39.496 --> 51:40.893
It's been about an hour.

51:41.807 --> 51:44.496
I was thinking...I think
he's gone.

51:48.644 --> 51:50.644
Nothing's moved out there.

51:50.668 --> 51:52.067
I don't know.

51:54.424 --> 51:55.981
What are we gonna do?

51:59.285 --> 52:01.314
I just want to be backing
off that truck and

52:01.339 --> 52:02.541
getting the fuck out of here.

52:02.566 --> 52:04.566
Yeah, well, just stay put.

52:06.450 --> 52:08.136
I'll haunt after daylight.

52:09.485 --> 52:10.995
Huh..

52:12.614 --> 52:13.847
We got a gun.

52:16.176 --> 52:17.699
If we could see it,
we can shoot it.

52:28.803 --> 52:30.715
It's just you and
me in the end of the world.

52:33.943 --> 52:35.375
Uh...

52:35.400 --> 52:36.676
Yeah.

52:39.082 --> 52:41.082
Let's get out of here.

52:44.266 --> 52:45.645
Ok.

52:56.476 --> 52:58.476
It's a fucking light!

52:58.500 --> 53:01.156
Jesus freaking Christ.

53:23.738 --> 53:25.128
Clear.

53:25.153 --> 53:26.292
Yeah.

53:27.344 --> 53:29.344
Where is the truck keys?

53:29.369 --> 53:31.369
What? Wait a minute, truck keys?

53:32.721 --> 53:34.721
What the hell does it look like?

53:34.745 --> 53:36.745
Ahh!

53:39.691 --> 53:41.691
Jesus, fuckin bullshit!

53:41.692 --> 53:42.728
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

53:42.752 --> 53:44.326
Where's the gun?

53:44.351 --> 53:46.843
It...it...it  bounced out of my hand.
I don't know.

53:46.844 --> 53:48.052
Did you forget?

53:48.077 --> 53:50.077
Maybe...I don't know.

53:50.834 --> 53:52.834
What about the roof?

53:53.873 --> 53:55.873
Bill!
Here!

53:55.897 --> 53:57.897
Here, over here!

53:59.894 --> 54:02.021
Can that thing get through
that fucking bed?

54:03.076 --> 54:05.076
Ok! Move! hey!

54:05.100 --> 54:07.896
One...two...three...

54:07.920 --> 54:09.920
Fuck it!

54:11.634 --> 54:13.845
3...2...1! The door!

54:17.145 --> 54:19.145
We can't stay here.

54:19.169 --> 54:21.169
Where else are we gonna go?

54:47.869 --> 54:49.188
It's gone.

55:21.705 --> 55:22.890
Bill!

55:22.914 --> 55:24.127
I fucked my ankle.

55:24.151 --> 55:26.478
No, no, no,no...move...

55:33.569 --> 55:36.028
Got them...?
Not on one key

55:36.029 --> 55:37.710
What does it look like?

55:37.735 --> 55:39.735
I'm gonna get the gun.
No! No!

55:39.759 --> 55:41.759
Don't do that. Bill, don't, don't...

55:41.783 --> 55:44.252
No, Bill. Don't leave me with
that thing .

55:44.276 --> 55:47.431
Bill, Bill! please!

55:47.455 --> 55:49.455
Please! Please!

55:50.048 --> 55:51.275
Fuck!

55:51.299 --> 55:52.287
Shit!

55:52.350 --> 55:55.529
Bill, Bill.
-Shh!

55:55.553 --> 55:57.553
Bill!
-Shh!

56:03.744 --> 56:05.044
Where did it go?

56:05.068 --> 56:07.068
It was crawling right there.

56:07.091 --> 56:09.091
Ok, let's get out of here!

56:09.116 --> 56:11.918
Hold on...
-No. Let's go!

56:11.941 --> 56:14.113
I think it's dead.
Dead?

56:14.138 --> 56:17.641
What? What?
It was bleeding very loud

56:17.665 --> 56:21.059
and it collapsed though there.

56:21.082 --> 56:23.863
It stopped.
Ok, great.

56:23.887 --> 56:25.710
That's fucking cool.

56:25.735 --> 56:27.735
Wait there.
No.

56:27.759 --> 56:30.108
No. No, fuck you.

56:31.327 --> 56:33.327
Uh! Ah!

57:07.119 --> 57:09.119
We have confirmation of contact.

57:09.996 --> 57:11.143
Yes.

57:12.975 --> 57:14.494
A video recording, sir.

57:16.033 --> 57:18.033
I'm going to see it now.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.305
You have my full
understanding, sir.

57:26.962 --> 57:28.500
I will be waiting your arrival.

57:47.259 --> 57:49.259
Fuck, come on, Bill!

57:49.284 --> 57:50.812
Bill, Bill, where are you?

57:54.031 --> 57:56.031
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

57:57.813 --> 57:59.813
Oh....

57:59.837 --> 58:02.322
Ah! Ah!

58:02.347 --> 58:03.622
Bill!

58:04.136 --> 58:05.307
Bill!

58:05.331 --> 58:07.714
Oh! Bill, Bill!!

58:07.739 --> 58:10.245
You've got to see this!

58:10.284 --> 58:12.284
What? What?

58:12.309 --> 58:14.309
Who's in your camera?

58:16.184 --> 58:18.184
What are you doing?

58:18.208 --> 58:19.394
Come here.

58:20.364 --> 58:21.730
My god!

58:32.785 --> 58:34.202
Hello?

58:35.535 --> 58:37.140
Who are you?

58:44.322 --> 58:45.699
I knew it was you!

58:48.257 --> 58:50.257
I've been waiting.

58:52.847 --> 58:55.441
Please, I...I'm needing help.

58:58.845 --> 59:00.845
Destroy them. I'm...
I'm nothing.

59:02.353 --> 59:04.353
I'm nothing!

59:05.531 --> 59:07.531
Ahhhh!

59:07.555 --> 59:09.555
Ahhh! Ahhh!

59:10.509 --> 59:12.509
Enough with the screaming already.

59:15.337 --> 59:16.157
It doesn't matter now.

59:16.182 --> 59:18.344
I've contacted council.
They will be here

59:18.369 --> 59:19.985
in a matter of hours.

59:21.743 --> 59:24.154
You'll be in their hands now
and let me tell you, Bill,

59:24.178 --> 59:26.458
their hands are a lot
 rougher than mine.

59:29.029 --> 59:31.029
We're moving...we've got some sound...

59:35.422 --> 59:37.422
It's here.

59:38.274 --> 59:40.274
creature is here.

59:42.007 --> 59:44.359
No! Hold your fire!

59:44.383 --> 59:46.273
Hold your fire, god damn it!

59:46.297 --> 59:48.297
Fucking idiots!

59:50.891 --> 59:53.752
You fucking chicken
shit morons!

59:54.714 --> 59:57.088
Don't just stand there
staring! Go get them.

59:59.151 --> 01:00:00.862
Toggle that.

01:00:01.402 --> 01:00:02.886
Fuck me.

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.449
There's a man.

01:00:09.379 --> 01:00:11.379
He's pretty fucked up.

01:00:12.715 --> 01:00:15.210
He's gotten the same substance
as the crash site.

01:00:15.234 --> 01:00:18.422
Oh, my God, I don't
 believe it. That's...

01:00:18.446 --> 01:00:20.031
That's Joe Sullivan.

01:00:20.055 --> 01:00:23.453
Repeat. Same substance from the truck.

01:00:23.477 --> 01:00:25.477
And at the crash sight.

01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:26.839
Is he alive?

01:00:29.698 --> 01:00:31.308
He'll survive.

01:00:32.058 --> 01:00:34.058
Bring him to me now.

01:00:34.735 --> 01:00:35.903
Copy.

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:43.514
Did you hear that, William?

01:00:44.748 --> 01:00:46.748
We're going to have a guest.

01:01:53.146 --> 01:01:55.146
You sure it's dead?

01:01:55.388 --> 01:01:57.388
It's not breathing.

01:02:27.813 --> 01:02:29.813
Uh, Bill...

01:02:29.837 --> 01:02:32.591
We should...We should
call someone.

01:02:34.497 --> 01:02:36.497
You focus on what you're doing.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.200
Listen...What is that?

01:02:48.738 --> 01:02:50.906
Whoa! Oh!

01:02:50.939 --> 01:02:53.427
Get the tape! Run!

01:02:56.522 --> 01:02:57.904
Bill.

01:02:58.725 --> 01:02:59.928
Hey Bill.

01:03:00.807 --> 01:03:02.186
Why don't we call the cops?

01:03:02.736 --> 01:03:04.210
No,we should...

01:03:04.235 --> 01:03:06.137
We call the cops
and they can come

01:03:06.162 --> 01:03:08.039
and then they can
call whenever and

01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:10.377
We can call the army and the national guard

01:03:10.402 --> 01:03:12.997
This isn't right. I need
we need  the new suppliers.

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:14.331
Wow...

01:03:14.356 --> 01:03:16.356
Shit. I don't feel good.

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.067
I wanna go home.

01:03:18.092 --> 01:03:20.512
Yeah...I wanna go home.
Bill, there's something wrong.

01:03:20.536 --> 01:03:24.387
Can you focus for a goddamned second?

01:03:25.247 --> 01:03:26.496
Good.

01:03:35.695 --> 01:03:37.657
-I saw that.
-I'm sorry.

01:03:37.712 --> 01:03:39.712
Will you clean that
shit up?

01:03:40.575 --> 01:03:41.915
What?

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.680
What are you talking about?

01:03:45.704 --> 01:03:48.798
- Clean that shit up!
-I'm sorry, Bill.

01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:52.049
Bill. Bill!

01:03:53.783 --> 01:03:57.361
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. Joe. Joe.
Shit!

01:03:57.869 --> 01:04:00.947
-Fuck...
-I'm sorry about that.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:04.292
Before...the police...the camera.

01:04:04.659 --> 01:04:06.799
Is all in here. Cassidy, Bill.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.712
Shh...

01:04:07.737 --> 01:04:09.737
This is his.

01:04:09.761 --> 01:04:11.439
It's so important.

01:04:11.837 --> 01:04:13.837
You're going to get the camera.

01:04:14.173 --> 01:04:16.173
And then you are gonna operate it.

01:04:16.197 --> 01:04:18.197
And I want you to see this. Are
you ready?

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:20.221
Come. Come closer.

01:04:20.245 --> 01:04:21.874
Over here. Come on.

01:04:22.538 --> 01:04:23.710
Look.

01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:25.060
Look at this. Look.

01:04:25.741 --> 01:04:27.085
See?

01:04:27.108 --> 01:04:29.755
Isn't it lovable?
It's good.

01:04:30.998 --> 01:04:32.998
The same thing that's
 inside of here

01:04:33.022 --> 01:04:35.022
is inside of me

01:04:35.593 --> 01:04:38.180
There's something bigger 
controlling us both.

01:04:44.427 --> 01:04:46.427
And I've got you.

01:04:49.288 --> 01:04:50.623
What's that?

01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:52.460
What?

01:04:52.484 --> 01:04:54.484
What's that? What's going on?

01:04:55.885 --> 01:04:57.273
We gotta go!

01:05:04.969 --> 01:05:06.087
Look.

01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:10.867
I got a visual! There he is!

01:05:10.892 --> 01:05:13.159
Target's on me. Take them!
take them!

01:05:13.183 --> 01:05:14.970
Target's on you. Go! Go!

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:16.995
Pull out! Pull out!

01:05:24.022 --> 01:05:25.511
in time, men.

01:05:27.472 --> 01:05:29.472
It's on you!

01:05:43.953 --> 01:05:45.574
My name is Joseph Sullivan.

01:05:45.598 --> 01:05:48.392
What you've just seen is 100

01:05:59.474 --> 01:06:01.994
That's not exactly how you
thought it would end, huh?

01:06:03.871 --> 01:06:05.510
Don't worry, William.

01:06:05.534 --> 01:06:08.230
That's not the end for you.

01:06:08.254 --> 01:06:11.895
It's just the start of a long life.

01:06:11.919 --> 01:06:13.919
Locked up in a cage...

01:06:13.943 --> 01:06:15.979
squealing like a dog

01:06:16.003 --> 01:06:18.487
while they stuff you like a pig.

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:22.917
I'm not afraid of you.

01:06:49.769 --> 01:06:51.173
What do you want?

01:06:52.498 --> 01:06:53.696
You!

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.490
do...suffer!

01:06:58.142 --> 01:07:01.243
We will find you!

01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:04.267
No you won't.

01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:06.916
We are in a heavily 
guarded facility here.

01:07:07.727 --> 01:07:11.727
You brought us!

01:07:14.688 --> 01:07:17.090
Listen to me, you
cocky fuck!

01:07:18.462 --> 01:07:21.790
We ripped apart your
granddaddy in the sixties

01:07:22.587 --> 01:07:25.455
We'll rip apart you
just the same!

01:07:26.121 --> 01:07:29.541
You will suffer

01:07:29.565 --> 01:07:31.565
most!

01:07:49.048 --> 01:07:53.587
You will suffer most!!!

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:07.449
We're approaching the facility
with Joe Sullivan.

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:11.027
He's not conscious. 
I hope you're ready for this.

01:08:12.023 --> 01:08:13.363
Aboart!

01:08:13.387 --> 01:08:16.015
Aboart! Do not bring
Joe Sullivan here!

01:08:16.562 --> 01:08:18.562
Kill subject immediately.

01:08:22.856 --> 01:08:24.617
Do not bring him here!

01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:29.841
Kill him!

01:08:55.904 --> 01:08:57.636
There's been a breach!

01:08:58.448 --> 01:09:00.448
Officer! Let him locked out!

01:09:53.067 --> 01:09:54.340
What happened?

01:10:03.953 --> 01:10:05.359
They're here.

01:10:26.517 --> 01:10:28.921
Please...let me go...

01:10:31.413 --> 01:10:32.796
Help me.

01:10:33.781 --> 01:10:35.781
What do I do? Tell me.

01:10:36.744 --> 01:10:39.643
Please, I don't want to die.

01:10:42.679 --> 01:10:44.268
They won't let you die.

01:10:48.124 --> 01:10:49.721
Please tell me something.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.256
Something that you know.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:52.413
Please.

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:55.882
I know they're like me.

01:10:56.999 --> 01:11:00.838
They may be something more
than is humanly possible.

01:11:02.245 --> 01:11:05.198
I can't imagine what 
they'll do to you.

01:11:21.067 --> 01:11:23.067
I guess it's over.

01:12:35.256 --> 01:12:36.486
Please...

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:38.924
Take it up.

01:12:40.373 --> 01:12:41.494
Make it stop.

01:12:46.169 --> 01:12:47.737
Make it end.

01:12:49.503 --> 01:12:50.853
I'm begging you.

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:31.177
Well...

01:14:32.654 --> 01:14:35.019
Congratulations, internet.

01:14:35.043 --> 01:14:36.316
You win.

01:14:36.558 --> 01:14:38.558
You deep dulled Sully.

01:14:40.527 --> 01:14:42.527
I drove for fourteen hours

01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:44.863
To an address

01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.608
that did not have Spider Nevy

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:52.194
I didn't even see the abducter. So...

01:14:53.319 --> 01:14:56.789
All in all, it ends to an epic fail.

01:14:59.039 --> 01:15:01.039
I promised you guys a white whale and...

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:05.286
I give you nothing. All I've got to
show for is this headache. So...

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.060
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

01:15:15.224 --> 01:15:17.224
I'll get back after it tomorrow.

01:17:37.168 --> 01:17:39.980
Hello everybody. My name
is Ashley Winnington-Ball

01:17:40.005 --> 01:17:43.092
and today we're going to
look directly at the sun.

01:17:43.116 --> 01:17:46.137
mass coronal ejection.

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:48.207
Sounds odd, huh?

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:49.591
As a matter of fact it is.

01:17:50.305 --> 01:17:56.216
