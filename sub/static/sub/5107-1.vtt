Where are you?

00:33.825 --> 00:35.189
Oh, yeah.
All right, all right, later.

00:36.361 --> 00:37.623
You all right, Alisa?

00:37.796 --> 00:39.353
You girls coming

00:39.565 --> 00:41.055
It's gonna be wicked,
everyone's gonna be there.

00:46.604 --> 00:49.573
So, I was, like, Listen, yeah, brush
your teeth after you lick me out...

00:49.574 --> 00:51.308
don't try and kiss me,
you get me?

00:51.309 --> 00:53.276
- That's proper grimy.
- I know, proper ghetto.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.604
Moony's buff, you know.

00:56.414 --> 00:59.178
- Have you got a spare cigarette?
- No, I'm giving up.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.816
Shaneek and Carleen are over there.
They're watching us.

01:02.954 --> 01:05.147
Did you finish the coursework
for them?

01:05.289 --> 01:06.415
No.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.022
Katie!

01:09.228 --> 01:12.163
You girls gotta come to my party.
It's gonna be heavy.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.628
- Who's gonna be there?
- Everyone's coming.

01:14.799 --> 01:17.393
Mum and dad are away,
so anything goes.

01:17.602 --> 01:18.967
Anything.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.097
- Please come.
- Safe, yeah?

01:24.777 --> 01:26.767
Hey, pussyhole,

01:32.984 --> 01:34.975
You like this,
isn't it, Charlotte?

01:35.119 --> 01:37.883
Why you calling me that?
You know my name's Claire.

01:38.624 --> 01:42.286
So that if anyone else hears, they don't
think that you're, you know, Sam's girl.

01:43.295 --> 01:46.354
- You scared of him, Jay?
- Of Sam? No.

01:57.276 --> 01:59.437
All right, girls.
Wanna come to my party?

01:59.978 --> 02:02.969
Are you gonna come? Surely your mum
can low you, it's Friday night.

02:03.247 --> 02:05.580
I don't know,
I'm not feeling too good.

02:05.783 --> 02:07.341
And I ain't got nothing to wear.

02:07.519 --> 02:10.920
Okay, if I score some money to get us
something to wear, will you come?

02:10.923 --> 02:13.517
- Where you gonna get that much money?
- Don't watch that.

02:15.259 --> 02:16.818
What go on, bitch?

02:16.994 --> 02:18.656
- You seen Claire anywhere?
- No.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.732
- What?
- No.

02:21.532 --> 02:24.296
What the fuck you looking at,
you fat bitch? You know me?

02:25.003 --> 02:26.562
Have you seen Claire?

02:27.239 --> 02:29.799
Can't we kick, man?
I'm not your fucking security guard.

02:58.837 --> 03:01.738
- Yes, Moony.
- Yo, Trife.

03:01.940 --> 03:04.374
- Where you been, man?
- I had a couple things to do, man.

03:04.676 --> 03:07.736
What's wrong with these batty holes,
man. Always fucking playing football.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.038
Come in the class,
stinking it up afterwards.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.115
Hey, just light the zoot, man.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.110
Come on, Becky.
Let's go.

03:19.191 --> 03:22.683
You know what? Them two girls
over there are fucking weird, blood.

03:22.895 --> 03:25.761
I know. What the fuck
she's looking at, man?

03:26.132 --> 03:27.792
How can you make her watch you
like that, blood?

03:28.133 --> 03:29.794
See me now, if that was me,
I wouldn't have it.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.562
You should spark
in her fucking face.

03:32.771 --> 03:35.239
Yeah, you watch.
I'm gonna mash her up.

03:35.374 --> 03:37.842
- Hey, come on, let's go, Jay.
- All right, man.

03:38.911 --> 03:40.912

- Yeah, yeah, course I will.

03:40.914 --> 03:41.641
- Come on.
- Yes, man, there...

03:41.914 --> 03:43.644
- and that Claire's pussy is live, man.
- You're gonna be late.

03:45.117 --> 03:47.278
Let's get inside
before the second bell.

03:50.489 --> 03:51.615
Come on.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.091
Oi, Alisa's looking tit, boy.

03:54.293 --> 03:55.590
Why you split up with her?

03:55.662 --> 03:57.652
I don't know, man.
I dashed it, isn't it?

03:57.931 --> 04:00.058
She just... I don't know.

04:00.266 --> 04:02.324
- Boy, you're a fool, Trife man.
- Hey, fuck off, man.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.900
You're brave, blood...
I would never leave that, man.

04:05.038 --> 04:08.734
- I'd fuck that everyday.
- Everyday, blood, standard.

04:08.941 --> 04:11.773
- What you talking about?
- Rub them titties all night, blood.

04:12.278 --> 04:15.577
What you uniform pussyholes know about
titties and pussy and all them thing?

04:15.782 --> 04:19.548
And what you doing chatting about Alisa?
I fucked that girl a few weeks ago, blood.

04:19.752 --> 04:22.015
Everyday for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.

04:28.595 --> 04:30.756
Think you're so bad, isn't it?

04:30.997 --> 04:34.330
What did I tell you before, huh?
When I call you, you must come.

04:36.335 --> 04:38.462
Beat her, Shaneek star.

04:39.471 --> 04:42.440
- What did I tell you your name was?
- Big bird.

04:43.910 --> 04:46.140
Leave me alone, please.

04:46.346 --> 04:47.574
Get up.

04:48.614 --> 04:50.138
Fucked her hard, blood,

04:50.316 --> 04:51.976
Bareback, no rubber smutting.
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

04:52.217 --> 04:55.516
- What you gonna do, man?
- Leave us alone, blood, man.

04:55.756 --> 04:57.882
Who the fuck you talking to?
Hold this fool.

04:58.091 --> 04:59.683
Low it, man, low it,

05:00.860 --> 05:02.224

05:02.462 --> 05:03.829

05:07.700 --> 05:10.190

05:10.905 --> 05:12.497
Hey, leave him, blood.
Who told you to pick him up?

05:13.539 --> 05:14.938
What you doing?

05:17.310 --> 05:19.971
No-one fucking likes you,
virgin fool.

05:20.813 --> 05:24.304
Didn't she tell you before?
Don't answer her back.

05:24.717 --> 05:27.015
So what are you?
Slag then?

05:27.320 --> 05:30.551
Go on, bitch,

05:30.757 --> 05:32.019
What?

05:33.092 --> 05:36.584
Pick up my ring
and tell everyone you're a virgin.

05:36.829 --> 05:38.319
Pick it up, man!

05:41.834 --> 05:42.960
Well?

05:43.870 --> 05:45.304

05:46.040 --> 05:48.707
You know what, blood. Hug him up like

05:48.708 --> 05:49.936
Hug him up, blood!

05:56.349 --> 05:57.977
Hey, what you doing, man?

05:58.485 --> 06:01.113
What, you can't fuck with mans
your own age? You gotta trouble us?

06:01.355 --> 06:02.879
Who the fuck you talking to?

06:03.089 --> 06:04.421
Hey, where you going, blood?
Where you going?

06:04.524 --> 06:05.684
Where you going?
Where?

06:10.395 --> 06:11.761
Fucking idiot.

06:16.736 --> 06:18.601
- Smack her up.
- Beat her up, Shaneek. Beat her!

06:21.141 --> 06:23.642
Look at her just fucking
sitting there. Fool.

06:23.643 --> 06:26.976
Go on, fuck off
and clean your duty self up, man.

06:28.881 --> 06:32.051
And none of you lot better say nothing
or else you'll get the same...

06:32.052 --> 06:34.111
as that bitch did
with her virgin self.

06:34.521 --> 06:35.714
She ain't no virgin.

06:36.222 --> 06:37.849
How the fuck would you know?

06:41.528 --> 06:43.996
Because me and her fucked

06:54.440 --> 06:57.638
- Is there gonna be girls there, though?
- Yeah, Jay, everyone's coming.

06:57.712 --> 06:59.679
Hey, don't be on no hype,
you know.

06:59.780 --> 07:00.804
Trife.

07:01.081 --> 07:03.349

- I don't know, man.

07:03.350 --> 07:04.283

07:07.821 --> 07:10.312
Laters, Jay, man.
All right, Moon.

07:11.860 --> 07:13.190
Hey, hey, wait up, wait up.

07:18.232 --> 07:19.859
Don't say anything.
Hang on a minute.

07:21.368 --> 07:22.960
- You all right?
- Yeah.

07:23.971 --> 07:26.461
- Look, why aren't you speaking to me?
- I am, man.

07:26.606 --> 07:29.131
You ain't chatted to me in, like,
three weeks.

07:30.277 --> 07:32.007
I've been doing
better things, isn't?

07:32.212 --> 07:34.840
- I need to speak to you about something.
- Come on, Alisa.

07:35.315 --> 07:36.304
Call me later, yeah?

08:05.212 --> 08:06.611
Listen, hear what, right.

08:06.914 --> 08:10.281
If you say anything to your fucking dad,
I'll kill you, you understand?

08:12.587 --> 08:15.612
I can make things so easy for you,
you know that?

08:22.963 --> 08:24.590
- Hi, poppet.
- Hey.

08:38.145 --> 08:40.044
Who's that boy you were with?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.214
I thought maybe
it was the one from before.

08:42.416 --> 08:45.852
No, I fell.
He was helping me up.

08:46.153 --> 08:50.352
Oh, right. Only I saw him giving you
a peck on the cheek.

08:51.659 --> 08:53.819
- I thought maybe it was him.
- No.

08:56.230 --> 08:58.061
How was biology?

08:59.601 --> 09:00.863
Katie?

09:01.536 --> 09:04.096
Katie, what the hell's happened
to your face? Look at me.

09:04.305 --> 09:05.431
I fell.

09:07.841 --> 09:09.332
You all right?

09:13.081 --> 09:15.140
Hello?
Yeah, I'm Dan Fineal.

09:16.484 --> 09:19.578
Yeah, Arthur. No, you were supposed
to be there two hours ago, mate.

09:24.159 --> 09:25.217
Trevor.

09:26.593 --> 09:27.686
Get in.

09:34.469 --> 09:37.666
School finish at four.
Why you take so long?

09:37.939 --> 09:39.667
I had to chat to one girl,
isn't it?

09:40.407 --> 09:43.171
This here is Andreas.

09:43.379 --> 09:44.545
Nice to meet you, bruv.

09:44.546 --> 09:47.845
- This is my nephew Trevor.
- Trife.

09:49.851 --> 09:51.682
You have the thing?

10:03.631 --> 10:04.689
You see...

10:05.867 --> 10:08.233
if you don't drill
the replica good...

10:08.603 --> 10:11.662
the bullet won't leave and pop!

10:13.709 --> 10:15.039
Is it okay?

10:15.843 --> 10:18.937
The last boy used to do this
for me, was shit.

10:19.981 --> 10:22.040
Guns always used to blow up.

10:22.784 --> 10:24.513
But this looks good.

10:24.719 --> 10:27.017
But I will have to test it.
Saying?

10:29.457 --> 10:32.292
So, listen, come see me
when you finish school tomorrow...

10:32.293 --> 10:34.557
and we can discuss business,
all right?

10:34.729 --> 10:36.061
- Cool.
- Yeah.

10:38.434 --> 10:40.060
Now get out.

10:45.841 --> 10:48.502
Me just a joke with you.

10:48.743 --> 10:50.142
Me see you tomorrow, yeah?

10:50.479 --> 10:52.708
- Don't be late, you know.
- I won't, I won't.

10:54.149 --> 10:56.275
- Later.
- All right, Trevor.

10:56.718 --> 10:58.582
My little gun driller.

11:00.856 --> 11:02.186
Hi, Katie.

11:04.726 --> 11:06.217
- Hi, love.
- Hi.

11:08.863 --> 11:11.354
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's fine.

11:11.666 --> 11:13.759
Oh, that.
She fell over at school.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.238
Christ, Arthur's really fucked up
my day.

11:23.578 --> 11:25.068
Under the seat.

11:41.930 --> 11:43.056
Oh, shit.

11:43.798 --> 11:47.666
Curtis, I've forgotten the change, man.
I've left it back at my place.

11:48.804 --> 11:50.999
I'm really sorry. I'll bring it round
to yours later, yeah?

11:53.575 --> 11:57.340
Fuck it, I fuck, I fucked up. Look,
take it back, we'll sort it out tomorrow.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.377
Cool. Cool.

12:01.383 --> 12:02.715
You sure?

12:03.253 --> 12:04.412
Go on.

12:05.688 --> 12:07.087
Cool. Cheers, man.

12:12.261 --> 12:14.855
- See you tomorrow.
- Cool, man. Cheers.

12:17.033 --> 12:18.867
I think she's being bullied
at school.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.131
- Did she say that?
- No. But...

12:21.236 --> 12:23.204
Well, don't worry about it.
She's a bright kid, she'd tell us.

12:23.405 --> 12:24.633
Have you seen
my address book anywhere?

12:24.772 --> 12:26.638
Don't worry about it?
What sort of thing is that to say?

12:26.842 --> 12:28.969
Aren't you worried about
your own daughter?

12:29.044 --> 12:30.204
Have you asked her?

12:32.482 --> 12:34.245
There you go.
She's fine.

14:25.028 --> 14:27.496
Lenny, could you get your sister
to turn that shit off, please.

14:27.497 --> 14:30.762
- It's been playing for ages.
- Doesn't bother me.

14:31.534 --> 14:32.831
Fine.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.994
Katie! Katie!

14:35.672 --> 14:38.140
Katie! Katie!

14:39.742 --> 14:40.868

15:31.094 --> 15:33.527

15:33.731 --> 15:37.689
I hope you two boys use this day
to remember that poor girl...

15:37.934 --> 15:39.925
and not for foolishness.

15:40.737 --> 15:42.262
- Yes, mum.
- Course, Mrs. Hector.

15:42.472 --> 15:43.769
Go on.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.704
That's right, blood,
do what your mum says.

15:47.778 --> 15:49.405
Shut up, man.

15:49.847 --> 15:52.543
Yeah, blood...

15:53.617 --> 15:56.278
Told my mum the whole year

15:57.620 --> 16:00.020
- This is proper sad, man.
- I know, man.

16:00.290 --> 16:03.418
I was just about to leave my yard,
like had my uniform on and everything.

16:03.661 --> 16:06.630
Listen, blood, Sam and them girls
always picking on her.

16:06.897 --> 16:08.765
Yeah, but Sam
troubles us too, blood...

16:08.766 --> 16:10.825
and we ain't committing suicide
over it, are we?

16:11.368 --> 16:13.666
If anyone should fucking die,
it's him man.

16:13.870 --> 16:16.566
Can't believe someone
I pressed is dead.

16:16.773 --> 16:17.933
So why didn't you tell me
then, man?

16:18.042 --> 16:20.067
She asked me
not to say nothing, isn't it.

16:20.177 --> 16:22.077
Thought people would call her
sket and thing.

16:22.346 --> 16:25.007
Plus her dad caught us...
Hey, you got a zoot?

16:25.181 --> 16:28.549
No, I got a roll up, though.
Jacked it off my mum.

16:29.152 --> 16:30.552
Spark that, man.

16:38.495 --> 16:39.826
Blood, weird thing is, though...

16:40.764 --> 16:42.891
her dad came by late last night.

16:43.633 --> 16:45.898
That's how I found out
she was dead.

16:47.104 --> 16:50.437
In her suicide note, she said
something about Sam troubling her.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.369
- But I was always nice to her.
- A note?

16:55.145 --> 16:56.338
Well, did she mention me?

16:58.449 --> 17:00.316
I never see you chat to her
anyway, man.

17:00.317 --> 17:01.784
Blood, don't watch
what I do, man.

17:01.851 --> 17:04.012
You ain't always with me, and
you never knew I pressed her either.

17:04.221 --> 17:07.324
You come like some secret agent
or something, man.

17:07.325 --> 17:08.814
Let me have two draw
of that, man.

17:09.425 --> 17:12.088
Hey, listen bell Moony.
I wanna duck out quick.

17:13.262 --> 17:14.662
The whole day?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.790
Don't lie, blood.

17:18.736 --> 17:21.569
Yeah, I'll have
to take a cab still.

17:22.007 --> 17:24.473
Moons, just hurry up though, man.
All right, bless.

17:27.243 --> 17:29.371
- Hey, blood, you see Katie, yeah?
- Yeah.

17:30.114 --> 17:32.139
Do you reckon
she would have banged me, like?

17:32.348 --> 17:33.611
No, man.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.319
Why not?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.153
I think I'm buff.

17:37.154 --> 17:39.816
Blood, I beg you,
play the fucking game, man.

17:44.495 --> 17:45.757
Oh, fuck's sake.

17:51.001 --> 17:52.059
Hello?

17:52.537 --> 17:54.629
- Yeah, who's that?
- It's me.

17:55.773 --> 17:57.435
You didn't call me.

17:57.941 --> 18:00.501
Did you hear?
Sad, isn't it?

18:02.146 --> 18:05.512
- Look, what are you doing today?
- Gonna jam with Moons and Jay.

18:06.184 --> 18:10.177
Might go up West End later.
Gotta check my uncle, why?

18:11.289 --> 18:14.224
- No, just tell me now, man.
- I'd rather see you.

18:14.525 --> 18:16.618
You don't need to see me,
you ain't my girl no more. What is it?

18:20.231 --> 18:21.699
What the fuck do you mean
you're pregnant?

18:21.700 --> 18:23.133
Oh, my days!

18:23.134 --> 18:25.159
You can't be fucking pregnant. I thought
you'd get the morning after pill?

18:25.403 --> 18:27.700
It's not just up
to the girls, you know.

18:29.506 --> 18:30.803
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

18:32.543 --> 18:34.569
I've been taking tests all week.

18:36.047 --> 18:37.309
Look...

18:38.650 --> 18:39.844
I want us to get back together.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.813
Later, fuck that.
After you fucked Sam a few weeks ago?

18:43.487 --> 18:45.250
Yeah, he told me he bare backed you.
That's even worse man.

18:45.422 --> 18:47.391
- You never knew I knew that, did you?
- But we do know!

18:47.624 --> 18:49.114
Hey, and don't bother trying
to explain, man.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.128
You know what,
for all I know the baby's his.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.196
Fact now that I think of it,
I know it is, and you know it too.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.389
Yeah, blood, she's loose, man.
Cut her off, man.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.931
What?
I slept with Katie last year.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.504
Me and you weren't even together,
so fuck off!

19:00.505 --> 19:03.303
Standard, blood. You get me. I told you
about that girl, man, she's a sket.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.035
Pregnant, though.
It's a bit deep, still.

19:10.248 --> 19:12.045
- So what you gonna do?
- I don't know, man.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.808
Fuck it, it can't be mine.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.852
I just don't need
this shit today.

19:17.255 --> 19:20.155
So what, can man's come
and reach your uncle with you, blood?

19:21.593 --> 19:24.391
No, I think he wants
to see me alone, still.

19:26.264 --> 19:27.754
So, what did he say?

19:28.433 --> 19:30.161
He said he's going out.

19:30.468 --> 19:33.437
And that fucking Sam told him
we slept together.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.331
So why didn't you tell him
what happened?

19:35.406 --> 19:37.136
He didn't give me
a fucking chance.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.939
You know what, yeah,
fuck him and this fucking baby.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.182
- All right, girls?
- Mum, don't you knock?

19:45.383 --> 19:46.873
Oi, none of your lip.

19:47.285 --> 19:49.981
I know you're upset,
but that's no reason to be cheeky.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.383
- Do you want a drink, Becky?
- No, thanks.

19:52.590 --> 19:54.957
Right, I'm off to work.
Lis, I want you back by midnight.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.128
- Oh, mum!
- One, then, on the dot.

19:57.395 --> 19:59.463
And if you think you can't get back here
call your dad and he'll pick you up.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.728
- All right?
- Okay.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.692
Alis...

20:06.872 --> 20:09.932
I know you're upset, but there's
nothing you could have done.

20:10.308 --> 20:12.538
Now, I'm sad for
that other girl's parents...

20:13.711 --> 20:16.407
but all that really matters
is that you're all right.

20:16.614 --> 20:18.445
Are you all right?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.149
I'm...

20:24.990 --> 20:26.116
I'm fine.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.151
Good.
See you later, darling.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.860
- I love you, Lis.
- Love you.

20:34.699 --> 20:37.759
Yo, D. Guess what, man,
I got the day off school.

20:37.969 --> 20:40.096
And I'm going to that party
tonight as well.

20:40.206 --> 20:43.140
Yeah, I know.
Your school belled a while ago.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.602
Hi, Lenny.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.738
I'm sorry about your sister, bro.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.481
Tell your mate Trevor
I said thank you.

20:52.484 --> 20:53.542
See you.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.450
So, you gonna help me or what?

20:58.858 --> 20:59.790
Yeah.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.386
I still can't believe
Katie killed herself.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.762
So, what do you wanna do?

21:08.901 --> 21:10.300
You know what...

21:10.569 --> 21:12.161
I wanna get fucked up.

21:12.371 --> 21:14.634
I wanna go shopping for tonight,
that'll make me feel better.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.330
And if Trife don't want me,
I'm sure someone else will.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.477
I meant about the baby.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.245
Lose it, if I'm lucky.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.414
Well, at least
you're thinking straight.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.316
We've got the whole day off,
we might as well do something...

21:25.317 --> 21:26.985
constructive with ourselves.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.113
I know where we can score
some wicked draw.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.920
I'd get so fat if I kept this.

21:36.563 --> 21:37.722
Taxi!

21:39.164 --> 21:40.189
What the fuck, man?

21:49.875 --> 21:52.138
What's fucking taking him
so long, man?

21:55.881 --> 21:56.906
Taxi!

21:57.182 --> 21:58.706
Fuck off!

21:59.184 --> 22:00.515
Fucking hell, man!

22:01.253 --> 22:01.981
Come on.

22:03.689 --> 22:04.849
Fuck, man.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.563
Look at this girl's pussy. Looks like
her guts are hanging out and shit.

22:12.564 --> 22:16.193
Man, that's nasty, man.
I hate that shit, ugly pussy.

22:16.468 --> 22:18.697
- Still poke it, though.
- No, that's not for me, star.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.565
I won't fuck no girl, yeah,
unless she's got a DV?

22:21.907 --> 22:23.204
DV?

22:23.510 --> 22:26.511
Designer vagina, man.
Neat tucked in lips and shit.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.740
It's the way forward, blood.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.042
So, who's this guy again?

22:31.450 --> 22:34.786
Rupert. I met him at some rave.
He gives me weed and shit for free.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.482
Is it? Safe.

22:44.229 --> 22:45.595
Finally.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.291
Let's roll, man.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.866
Yes, Jay, what's cooking, bruv?

22:53.106 --> 22:55.733
- Yeah, like the trim, rude boy.
- Bye, mum.

22:58.345 --> 23:00.778
- What took you so fucking long, man?
- There weren't no cabs, isn't it.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.515
I've been hav¡ng a good week, actually.
Come on ¡n.

23:11.958 --> 23:15.051
So, Rebecca,
who's your lovely friend?

23:15.328 --> 23:18.320
- I'm Alisa.
- Alisa? What a pretty name.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.699
Ladies, this is my friend
Hamish.

23:21.200 --> 23:21.996
Hi.

23:22.168 --> 23:25.626
Go and take a seat on the sofa, take
your coats off, make yourselves at home.

23:29.476 --> 23:30.737
How much do you want this time?

23:31.044 --> 23:34.069
- As much as you wanna give.
- Not a problem.

23:36.316 --> 23:39.080
But I want some E's today
and maybe some coke.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.786
The weed I can do for free, but,
coke and E's is gonna cost.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.020
I haven't got no money on me.

23:49.229 --> 23:51.197
Who needs money?

24:11.451 --> 24:14.511
- Get your knickers off then.
- In your fucking dreams.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.389
- What, you're not gonna let me fuck you?
- No.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.858
- What about a blow-job then?
- Fuck off.

24:21.061 --> 24:23.825
- Wank?
- Keep talking and you'll get a smack.

24:24.365 --> 24:26.628
Oh, come on, Al,
we'll make dollars when we sell it.

24:26.834 --> 24:28.027
Do you wanna shop or what?

24:28.334 --> 24:31.235
- Yeah, but...
- Stop being such a boring bitch then.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.837
But I'm not gonna suck it, okay?

24:46.753 --> 24:48.220
What is that?

24:56.964 --> 24:59.454
- How old are you?
- I'm old enough, blood.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.826
"Blood", you're too young
to buy these beers.

25:02.068 --> 25:05.197
- What? Oh, shut up, man.
- Oi, come back.

25:06.039 --> 25:09.031
- Come back!
- Come back or what, man? Shut your mouth.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.935
- I'll have you arrested!
- You ain't gonna do shit, man.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.079
- Get out of my shop.
- What?

25:13.080 --> 25:15.147
- You're banned!
- Man, I'll leave when I wanna leave, man.

25:15.148 --> 25:16.342
What? Come.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.315
- Dickhead.
- Fuck off.

25:21.554 --> 25:22.384
Bastard!

25:23.757 --> 25:26.987
I ain't fucking with her no more, man,
after she got banged by Sam.

25:27.261 --> 25:29.751
Fuck that, you get me?
She's any girl to me now. Fuck her.

25:29.964 --> 25:33.558
Bloods, I wouldn't care whose baby
it is, yeah, but I'd still bang that.

25:35.769 --> 25:37.237
Hey, bloods, where's yours?

25:37.238 --> 25:39.071
Had to dash it at that guy,
isn't it, man.

25:39.073 --> 25:40.836
- He was shook, though.
- You're a bad man.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.167
Let's dust, man.

25:42.343 --> 25:44.140
I ain't standing on the corner like
a fucking rent boy all day.

25:44.411 --> 25:47.073
- So what, which way are we going, bruv?
- Let's roll this way, isn't it.

25:51.385 --> 25:54.012
What's wrong, man?
What are you looking at?

25:54.622 --> 25:56.214
Sam lives over there.

25:57.725 --> 26:00.352
- You wanna get your GameBoy back?
- Yeah.

26:02.396 --> 26:04.463
Yeah that, I'm on that, man,
let's do it. Come, come.

26:04.464 --> 26:06.398
Let's not be stupid, man.

26:08.502 --> 26:11.403
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Sam's gonna be at school, blood, yeah?

26:11.606 --> 26:13.006
Only our year's got the day off.

26:13.007 --> 26:14.207
We'll just go up there,
say we're his friends...

26:14.208 --> 26:16.075
and we're picking it up,
isn't it? Simple.

26:16.076 --> 26:19.244
Or, we ding the bell,
get through the main door...

26:19.245 --> 26:20.980
and boot down his fucking
front door, isn't it.

26:20.981 --> 26:23.550
No, man.
That's some police shit.

26:23.552 --> 26:25.051
Look, blood, there's three
of us alie...

26:25.052 --> 26:27.486
we'll just go up there, yeah,
ask for it back.

26:27.655 --> 26:29.919
And if he's gets brave, blood, we'll
handle it at school together, isn't it.

26:30.057 --> 26:31.581
- Standard, let's roll.
- But he rolls deep, man!

26:31.859 --> 26:34.089
- Hey, fuck it, man, let's do it.
- Oh, shit.

26:44.071 --> 26:46.699
What the fuck is he doing at home,
man? He's gonna kill us.

26:46.907 --> 26:49.740
- Hey, don't worry, man, he's gone.
- What if he comes back, though, like?

26:49.943 --> 26:51.535
He won't, man. What's wrong with you?
What you scared for, man?

26:51.679 --> 26:53.669
I'm not, man.
I think we should just duck, man.

26:53.882 --> 26:55.816
- Just shut up, man, you're scared.
- I'm not.

26:58.820 --> 27:00.377
- Hello.
- Hi.

27:00.788 --> 27:03.780
We're Sam's friends. We've just come
here to pick something up.

27:04.024 --> 27:07.084
Sam's not here.
He's just gone to the shop for me.

27:07.294 --> 27:09.989
Yeah, we saw him downstairs, he told
us to come up and wait for him.

27:10.198 --> 27:11.858
He just left, right?

27:19.173 --> 27:20.765
Hey, that must be his room.

27:25.247 --> 27:27.875
- That's where your GameBoy is.
- Is that my GameBoy, bloods?

27:29.583 --> 27:31.050
Oh shit, shit, oh shit.

27:31.286 --> 27:33.014
What if he comes back now?

27:33.220 --> 27:34.688
What the fuck
are you lot doing here?

27:34.922 --> 27:37.618
Sam jacked my sister's GameBoy,
yeah, I'm just here to take it back.

27:37.825 --> 27:40.089
- Hold this boy.
- Hey, Moons, hold him. Hold him, man.

27:40.362 --> 27:42.795
He told me he bought that,
he's such an arsehole.

27:43.198 --> 27:44.231
Yo, what's out there?

27:44.232 --> 27:46.495
Balcony, where he stashes
his weed and shit.

27:46.834 --> 27:48.632
Come and take this boy
outside, man.

27:48.869 --> 27:50.336
If he's such an arsehole,
why are you with him?

27:50.572 --> 27:53.439
I don't know, he's older,
more mature.

27:54.141 --> 27:55.733
Then why you cheat him?

27:56.878 --> 27:59.813
- Blood, you can't take his weed, man.
- Fuck that, man.

27:59.814 --> 28:02.078
- Hey, Jay, man, we got him.
- Just give me one minute, man.

28:04.385 --> 28:06.387
I don't even know
why you're with that boy, man.

28:06.388 --> 28:08.548
Look...
you could be my girlfriend.

28:09.324 --> 28:13.350
It's just, he sa¡d ¡f I leave h¡m,
he'll tell everyone I was a sh¡t fuck.

28:14.262 --> 28:17.425
No, no, I know you're not shit,
I bet you're cold in bed, man.

28:17.632 --> 28:18.792
I don't know...

28:18.999 --> 28:21.535
He says I'm not that good
and I've only slept with him, so...

28:21.536 --> 28:23.136
Yeah, well, let me be the judge
of that then, isn't it.

28:23.137 --> 28:24.161
What?

28:24.706 --> 28:28.199
- What, has he got any rubbers in here?
- Yeah, in that drawer. Why?

28:28.476 --> 28:31.570
Not now, Jay, man, his mum said
he only went down the road.

28:35.583 --> 28:38.608
- Maybe you lot should go.
- You know what, don't watch that, man.

28:48.463 --> 28:50.863
Oh, no, no, no, low it, man.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.563
- I'm sorry, yeah, this don't normally...
- It's okay.

28:54.768 --> 28:58.205
It's because you're so buff,
yeah, and like you're good, man.

28:58.207 --> 29:02.743
In fact, yeah, you should leave
that pussyhole and be my girlfriend.

29:02.744 --> 29:05.979
- What do you think, yeah?
- What if he beats me up or something?

29:05.980 --> 29:07.777
No, he ain't gonna do that.
Look, you know what, darling.

29:07.949 --> 29:10.076
- Come with me. Come.
- Are you done?

29:10.819 --> 29:12.549
- One minute.
- You fucking know about it.

29:13.688 --> 29:15.823
You let the side down!

29:15.824 --> 29:17.925
What's up, man? You don't even know
about sex live, man.

29:17.926 --> 29:20.224
What the fuck you lot doing
in my yard?

29:21.596 --> 29:24.224
Look, blood, you took
my GameBoy, man, I just...

29:24.432 --> 29:27.458
Are you dizzy, blood? You're gonna
come up here like you're bad.

29:27.670 --> 29:29.762
You see, yeah,
I'm gonna fuck you up, blood.

29:29.971 --> 29:33.532
And you, see, you, Claire, I'm gonna
shove this bat so far up your pussy...

29:34.043 --> 29:35.031
Shit.

29:35.310 --> 29:37.107
Hey, fuck you, you fucking prick.

29:37.412 --> 29:39.710
- Fucking idiot!
- Hold on, hold on, man.

29:40.048 --> 29:41.208
Oh, shit!

29:46.889 --> 29:48.617
Come on, lets go.

29:51.926 --> 29:53.360
Run, blood!

30:17.352 --> 30:19.047
I can't believe
what you lot just done.

30:19.255 --> 30:20.722
Hey, fuck him, man,
he deserved it.

30:20.823 --> 30:23.188
Hey, you know
he fucked Alisa, isn't it?

30:23.425 --> 30:24.619
No, I didn't.

30:25.427 --> 30:26.927
Sam's gonna kill me.

30:26.929 --> 30:28.829
He ain't gonna do shit to you, man.
You know why?

30:29.031 --> 30:30.520
Because you're my girl now,
you get me?

30:30.800 --> 30:33.098
Yeah, man, let him come, man.
You see my uncle I'm checking today?

30:33.334 --> 30:36.428
He's a proper bad man. And if Sam
thinks about doing anything...

30:36.705 --> 30:38.297
my uncle will murk him
on the spot, standard.

30:38.506 --> 30:40.736
You keep talking about your uncle
that's gonna do this and that, yeah?

30:40.976 --> 30:42.409
But we ain't even met him, man.
I mean, what...

30:42.611 --> 30:44.145
are you sure my man
even exists, like?

30:44.146 --> 30:45.947
He comes like the invisible man
or something, blood.

30:45.948 --> 30:48.142
- Yeah. Hollow Man, rude boy.
- I'll slap you, you know that, Moons?

30:48.417 --> 30:50.749
Just wait till we need him
and he'll be here.

30:51.020 --> 30:53.783
If he's there, I'm there. I'll jook
some up, blood. I don't business.

30:54.022 --> 30:55.785
Shut up, Moons man,
you ain't gonna do shit, man.

30:57.661 --> 31:00.228
I can't believe you swallowed
that guy's spunk.

31:00.229 --> 31:03.164
I hate it, it tastes like
salty egg whites.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.428
Yuk, but what
if he's got something?

31:05.701 --> 31:08.937
You can't catch nothing like that.
All the acids in your stomach kill it.

31:08.938 --> 31:11.270
- Did you like wanking that guy?
- No.

31:11.507 --> 31:13.032
Was you wet?

31:13.309 --> 31:15.402
- Yeah, a little bit.
- A little bit?

31:15.611 --> 31:18.944
- Yeah, but his thing's so small, man.
- I bet you was mad wet, I was.

31:19.182 --> 31:20.849
Well then, why didn't you
just fuck that Rupert friend...

31:20.850 --> 31:22.112
and I wouldn't have had
to wank him.

31:22.351 --> 31:25.649
You just said you liked it.
Anyway only my man gets the pussy.

31:25.855 --> 31:28.049
Unlike you, obviously.
You sure you know whose baby it is?

31:28.123 --> 31:30.523
- Don't try it, Becky.
- Yeah, well, I couldn't have that in me.

31:30.726 --> 31:32.921
If I was you, I'd want to rip it out
with a coat-hanger.

32:11.066 --> 32:13.694
- Fucking hell, man!
- What, blood?

32:14.771 --> 32:16.372
Didn't I tell them no onions?

32:16.373 --> 32:18.397
Yeah, you did, man,
you did say no onions, blood, man.

32:22.811 --> 32:24.712
Didn't I say no onions?

32:24.713 --> 32:25.873
Fool.

32:47.036 --> 32:49.704
- Oi, what's going on?
- We got money, relax yourself.

32:49.705 --> 32:51.229
Drive, man.

32:51.473 --> 32:53.101
So, what, are me and you on
or what now?

32:53.343 --> 32:55.936
- Yeah, yeah, I'm your girl.
- Yeah?

32:57.314 --> 32:58.644
Yeah.
Come here.

33:01.885 --> 33:04.787
Well, I gotta go home.
I'll see you tonight, yeah?

33:04.788 --> 33:06.653
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
all right, take care, yeah.

33:32.849 --> 33:34.783
Coke head baby.

33:36.052 --> 33:38.420
Whatever, man,
it'll be gone soon.

33:38.421 --> 33:40.389
God, I ain't changing
no fucking nappies for it.

33:41.524 --> 33:43.855
Look, yeah, there's an abortion clinic
number here, do you wanna bell it?

33:44.095 --> 33:47.359
Not now, man. Not today.
Look, can I use your toilet?

33:47.497 --> 33:49.431
Are you gonna do a shit?
Because if you are, then, no.

33:49.666 --> 33:51.998
That's loose, man, I don't do that
in other people's houses.

33:52.235 --> 33:55.204
Well, hurry up, we need to get
the money for the garms.

34:39.549 --> 34:41.710
Yeah, she's banged up, babes.
Yeah.

34:43.219 --> 34:44.708
All right, see you soon.

34:46.556 --> 34:48.717
- Who was that?
- My man.

34:54.330 --> 34:57.128
- Listen, lads, where you off to?
- Oxford Street, man.

34:57.367 --> 34:59.392
Well, why don't you walk?
It's only down the road.

34:59.470 --> 35:00.870
Because we wanted
to catch a cab, man.

35:00.871 --> 35:02.770
Why don't you shut your mouth
and mind your own business, blood?

35:02.973 --> 35:05.203
Well, to be honest might have
to drop you off at Marble Arch...

35:05.442 --> 35:08.935
- because the traffic's...
- What's wrong with you?

35:09.280 --> 35:11.713
Yeah, man, yeah, Tr¡fe
and them two l¡ttle pussyholes.

35:12.916 --> 35:15.316
Yeah, man, yeah. No, no, don't reach,
don't reach, I'm cool, yeah.

35:15.519 --> 35:17.520
Listen I swear down, blood,
if I see them before you see...

35:17.521 --> 35:18.954
I'm gonna bang them up.
I'm gonna bang them up.

35:19.190 --> 35:21.180
I'm gonna bust their heads,
do you understand me?

35:21.392 --> 35:24.054
Listen, if you eye them, yeah if you
see them, you just ding me, yeah.

35:35.839 --> 35:38.974
- Can we go and get something to eat?
- No, I don't wanna look fat for Mark.

35:38.975 --> 35:42.070
- But I'm starving, though.
- We'll get a pizza when we get to his.

35:55.593 --> 35:57.527
- Cheers, mate.
- That's nine pound twenty, mate.

35:58.062 --> 36:01.224
You know what, mate, I got passed
by five black cabs today.

36:01.432 --> 36:03.559
- Well, that ain't my fault, mate.
- Just because I'm black.

36:03.801 --> 36:06.827
Ain't that ironic, though, like?
Black cab don't take black man.

36:07.037 --> 36:09.506
- So, what's your point?
- My point is that...

36:09.507 --> 36:11.406
it becomes a vicious circle.

36:11.609 --> 36:13.702
- Well, what's that mean?
- It means...

36:15.514 --> 36:17.277
Come back!

36:19.049 --> 36:21.541
- Come on.
- You little black bastard!

36:54.985 --> 36:57.044
Now I'm hungry.

36:57.655 --> 36:59.816
Why did you bring me here again?

37:00.458 --> 37:03.484
We give him some dope and he gives us
money for our dresses.

37:03.694 --> 37:04.752
Can we get it and go, please,
because I'm really tired...

37:04.863 --> 37:06.762
of listening to you two fuck.
Look...

37:07.165 --> 37:09.929
I didn't know he was gonna be so old.

37:10.101 --> 37:12.068
He's twenty-eight. He's an actor.

37:12.636 --> 37:14.797
That's almost twice our age.

37:15.006 --> 37:17.668
I know, but he thinks I'm eighteen,
though, so...

37:20.078 --> 37:21.943
You were good, baby.

37:24.315 --> 37:26.482
You lot want anything else?

37:26.483 --> 37:27.575
No.

37:34.192 --> 37:35.726
Hang on, hang on,
I thought she was pregnant?

37:35.727 --> 37:37.694
Yeah, she is right now,
but she's getting rid of it.

37:38.129 --> 37:40.654
- Go on, Lis, it's good.
- Okay.

37:42.367 --> 37:45.164
So how much do you want for all this?
Three hundred?

37:46.004 --> 37:46.902
Yeah.

37:47.639 --> 37:49.663
All right, I'll go get it.

37:53.043 --> 37:54.602
Right, I'll be back
in a minute, yeah?

37:59.650 --> 38:02.210
So, you like what you see, huh?

38:02.921 --> 38:04.047
No.

38:04.489 --> 38:06.286
So what do you
come upstairs for then?

38:06.625 --> 38:09.992
- I wanted to see if she was all right.
- She was fucking great.

38:10.295 --> 38:12.558
- I bet you are as well.
- Fuck off!

38:13.331 --> 38:14.388
You're sick.

38:14.732 --> 38:17.428
- You know she's only fifteen?
- Yeah, of course I do.

38:17.637 --> 38:19.536
I found her student card.

38:19.738 --> 38:21.730
She thinks
it's her little secret.

38:24.042 --> 38:25.907
Do you know
what my little secret is?

38:27.044 --> 38:28.774
Go on, have a guess.

38:29.014 --> 38:30.811
I'm a fucking bastard.

38:34.953 --> 38:37.616
You know, I've never fucked
a pregnant girl before...

38:38.390 --> 38:40.290
but, with you,
I think I'd make the exception.

38:40.525 --> 38:42.186
How about you fuck yourself?

38:43.027 --> 38:45.929
You should take the chance
while you can, you little slag.

38:46.098 --> 38:48.362
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a fucking little slag...

38:48.501 --> 38:51.202
because you're fifteen years old
and you're pregnant.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.671
Probably some little black fellow
who hasn't hung around.

38:56.775 --> 38:58.834
But that's cool,
because I like you.

39:00.712 --> 39:02.680
So when you've decided
to dump it...

39:03.382 --> 39:05.373
why don't you come back
and see me?

39:05.817 --> 39:07.352
You won't have to get jealous of me
fucking your mate...

39:07.353 --> 39:09.320
because I'll probably
fuck you too.

39:13.124 --> 39:14.182
You know...

39:14.426 --> 39:17.293
- you're not right about everything.
- What's that, then?

39:18.129 --> 39:19.994
You're not a bastard...

39:23.468 --> 39:24.765
you're a cunt.

39:29.274 --> 39:32.266
Right, ready for round two, baby?

39:49.695 --> 39:51.889
Boy! This shop is heavy.

39:52.330 --> 39:54.855
Good afternoon, sirs.
Can I help you?

39:55.134 --> 39:58.432
- Yeah. Where are your hats, rude girl?
- Downstairs, sir.

40:06.412 --> 40:08.243
- It's here?
- It's over there.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.414
This is what you want, isn't?

40:11.851 --> 40:13.250
What do you think?

40:20.026 --> 40:21.823
You know what,
blood fuck that guard, man.

40:22.061 --> 40:23.028
You know what,
can we kick, man?

40:23.029 --> 40:24.997
I'm sure they've got better stuff
down the road anyway.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.304
Hey!

40:39.578 --> 40:41.045
Wait.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.609
Come on, come on.
Come with me. Come on.

40:45.984 --> 40:47.679
Get the fuck off me, man!
What you doing?

40:47.920 --> 40:49.320
- You're in a lot of trouble, mate.
- For what?

40:49.321 --> 40:52.017
- Stealing that hat.
- I had it on when I come in, man.

40:53.726 --> 40:55.193
- What's he taken?
- The cap.

40:55.327 --> 40:56.895
He had it on
when we came in, bro.

40:56.896 --> 40:58.557
Hey, pipe down, please.
And I'm not your bro.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.765
Oi, fuck off, blood, about pipe down.
Get off me, man!

41:00.766 --> 41:02.495
Listen, I told you,
I fucking had that when I come in.

41:02.735 --> 41:04.498
- Don't swear at me.
- And what the fuck you gonna do?

41:04.737 --> 41:06.104
You better watch it,
the police have been called.

41:06.105 --> 41:07.629
Hey, call them, man.
I don't give a fuck.

41:07.873 --> 41:09.374
I'll tell them, too.
I had the hat when I come in.

41:09.375 --> 41:10.341
Hey, check your cameras, man.

41:10.342 --> 41:11.943
Nisha, would you call
the police, please.

41:11.944 --> 41:14.708
This young man has taken this hat
and is now causing a commotion.

41:14.914 --> 41:16.745
- Is that all he's taken?
- Yeah.

41:16.982 --> 41:19.075
But he was wearing that cap
when he came in.

41:19.251 --> 41:21.386
- Are you sure?
- Yes, because I greeted him.

41:21.387 --> 41:22.581
Thank you!

41:22.823 --> 41:24.881
- I'm not sure that he was.
- I am sure. Sorry.

41:25.124 --> 41:27.423
Move out the fucking way
and let us out, man! Yo, blood.

41:27.594 --> 41:30.756
- Are you gonna fucking apologise, coz?
- Just leave, please.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.763
- Hey, hold up, man.
- What?

41:36.902 --> 41:40.202
Do you know what?
You want your hat so much, take it.

41:42.274 --> 41:43.674
Fucking prick!

41:47.646 --> 41:51.013
I'm stinging. Were you watching?
I bet you could hear, isn't it?

41:53.085 --> 41:55.679
So, three hundred squids, yeah, babes.
We'll split it down the mids.

41:55.889 --> 41:58.550
You got shoes, right?
We can't be looking like no tramps.

41:58.791 --> 41:59.424
Yeah.

41:59.425 --> 42:01.393
You are looking forward
to tonight, yeah?

42:01.460 --> 42:02.827
I don't know, yeah, probably.

42:02.828 --> 42:04.796
What's the matter, then?
You look like someone just...

42:04.998 --> 42:08.832
Exactly. Look,
I've been thinking about stuff.

42:09.669 --> 42:12.160
Me like this,
Katie killing herself.

42:12.606 --> 42:15.631
I mean, that is why
we got the day off.

42:15.808 --> 42:17.742
I don't know, maybe
we shouldn't go to the party.

42:17.944 --> 42:19.043
What?

42:19.045 --> 42:22.481
I don't know.
It's like, it's weird. It's strange.

42:22.716 --> 42:26.446
She was so tall and pretty...
I wish I was that tall.

42:28.454 --> 42:31.082
You know, I reckon
she could have been a model.

42:31.625 --> 42:33.491
I knew she was troubled, but...

42:33.493 --> 42:36.228
I never thought it was that bad
that she'd have to kill herself.

42:36.229 --> 42:38.390
Well, it's done now.
Nothing we can do.

42:38.865 --> 42:41.857
- I could have stuck up for her.
- So why didn't you?

42:42.068 --> 42:42.967
I don't know.

42:42.968 --> 42:45.804
Well, she's dead now.
Get over it. I am.

42:45.805 --> 42:48.641
Don't you ever think about anything
but yourself?

42:48.643 --> 42:51.509
Yeah.
Clothes, shoes, money, sex.

42:51.745 --> 42:54.145
Wait, sex involves me
though, don't it?

42:54.915 --> 42:56.940
Do you think Moony likes me?

42:57.150 --> 42:59.049
- I don't know.
- He's so fine.

42:59.785 --> 43:01.287
I won't fuck him
unless he eats me out.

43:01.288 --> 43:03.789
- Do you think he will?
- I don't know.

43:03.791 --> 43:05.451
So when you gonna get rid
of this baby?

43:06.893 --> 43:08.691
- Lis?
- Just leave it, Becky, yeah?

43:16.502 --> 43:20.064
Saint Martin Girls.
What you lot saying?

43:20.341 --> 43:23.332
Oi, do you hear about that big bird
girl that committed suicide?

43:23.544 --> 43:24.737
Proper sensitive, isn't it?

43:25.011 --> 43:28.208
She got so upset.
We was only joking with her.

43:28.481 --> 43:30.449
- Didn't look like a joke.
- Lis, shush.

43:30.649 --> 43:34.017
She just got a bit feisty, that's all.
She needed a little bit of slapping.

43:34.222 --> 43:37.714
But we was only playing with her.
We never meant her to slit her wrists.

43:38.592 --> 43:41.618
- She hung herself.
- Whatever. She's dead.

43:43.930 --> 43:45.795
- Because of you.
- What?

43:45.999 --> 43:47.832
She killed herself because you
and your friends bullied her...

43:47.833 --> 43:49.392
till she couldn't take it
no more.

43:49.837 --> 43:51.771
- You killed her.
- Shut up, you sket.

43:51.772 --> 43:53.137
- You killed her.
- Fucking shut up.

43:53.341 --> 43:54.307
You killed her.

43:54.541 --> 43:57.066
Listen, right, if you don't fucking
shut up, you're gonna join her.

43:57.310 --> 43:59.870
Look she don't mean it, yeah. Please,
don't beat us up. She's pregnant.

44:01.615 --> 44:03.640
You're that girl
that Sam fucked.

44:03.850 --> 44:06.478
Wait till I tell everyone
about this ho.

44:06.686 --> 44:07.921
You know what?
Yeah, tell them.

44:07.922 --> 44:10.789
Tell them Alisa's pregnant
and she's keeping the fucking baby.

44:11.158 --> 44:13.591
- What?
- I ain't scared of you.

44:13.928 --> 44:16.191
If you're gonna do something
to me, then do it.

44:18.598 --> 44:19.724
Go on.

44:20.701 --> 44:23.727
I got bigger things to worry about
than what you can do to me.

44:37.550 --> 44:38.882
What's the matter?

44:40.587 --> 44:43.318
- You should bang her up, star.
- I should, shouldn't I?

44:46.794 --> 44:49.261
What the fuck were you thinking,
Alisa? They could have beat us up.

44:49.462 --> 44:51.054
- So?
- You're so selfish.

44:51.299 --> 44:53.790
What if my face got scarred
or something?

44:54.001 --> 44:55.969
And what the fuck are you talking about
"keeping the baby"?

44:56.037 --> 44:57.036
You're not gonna have
an abortion now?

44:57.037 --> 45:00.235
- Just leave it, Becky.
- So, what, are you like pro-life now?

45:00.408 --> 45:02.671
No, but a girl we both
knew just died...

45:02.877 --> 45:04.776
and I didn't do anything
to stop it.

45:04.879 --> 45:07.848
- But I can do something about this.
- So, okay...

45:08.050 --> 45:09.176
what about school?

45:09.417 --> 45:11.385
What if you'd have got raped?
Would you have an abortion then?

45:11.585 --> 45:13.917
- I don't know. Yeah, probably.
- You have to get rid of it.

45:14.088 --> 45:16.750
- Who's gonna help you?
- I don't need any help.

45:19.794 --> 45:22.455
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's morning sickness.

45:23.431 --> 45:26.798
- It's not morning though.
- Look, I need to speak to Trife.

45:27.001 --> 45:30.698
Let's go and buy our garms.
And then we'll find him, okay? Come on.

45:37.311 --> 45:39.212
Curtis lives up there.

45:42.116 --> 45:44.448
- What, is that it?
- I think so.

45:45.886 --> 45:47.080
You think so?

45:48.456 --> 45:50.252
You think...
you think so?

45:52.527 --> 45:55.051
Do you think I've got time
for what people think now, Del?

45:55.329 --> 45:57.559
- Is this the place, bro?
- Yes, it's the place.

45:58.199 --> 46:00.565
But you gotta do this
on your own, bruv.

46:00.835 --> 46:02.769
I'll wait for you back at mine.

46:03.037 --> 46:06.268
- You're gonna go now, is it?
- I can't be seen here, man.

46:13.080 --> 46:14.605
What would you do, man?

46:14.850 --> 46:16.373
What would you do, man?

46:32.299 --> 46:35.166
- That was a forty five pound hat, bloods.
- So?

46:35.535 --> 46:37.527
You could've give it to me
for tonight, like.

46:37.806 --> 46:40.468
Blood, it wouldn't have fit
your big African head anyway, man.

46:41.342 --> 46:42.639
Oh my days!

46:43.444 --> 46:46.146
You man, you man, you man,
check that gash over there, blood.

46:46.147 --> 46:49.344
- Shit, check the back of, rude boy.
- She's bathing as well, you know.

46:49.417 --> 46:52.386
See, that's what I want, blood.
I want a rich bitch like that.

46:52.587 --> 46:54.578
Yeah, so, so what, who's on it?
Me, yeah?

46:54.655 --> 46:56.885
No, blood, that's me, man.
I saw her first, isn't it?

46:56.957 --> 46:58.448
My size.

46:59.360 --> 47:00.952
My size.
Hey, darling, I'm...

47:01.929 --> 47:04.023
Hey, girl,
I'm talking to you, man.

47:04.432 --> 47:06.297
I'm chatting to you!

47:08.303 --> 47:10.328
I don't think she's on it.

47:11.373 --> 47:13.568
Blood, can't chat to a girl
like that, man.

47:13.774 --> 47:15.436
You think you're nang, blood? Why
don't you show him how to do it, then?

47:15.709 --> 47:17.233
Fuck it.
Let's duck, man.

47:17.645 --> 47:20.876
He don't wanna check for that
because he's still on Alisa, isn't it?

47:22.385 --> 47:24.784
Man, I'll show you now
I can chat to that girl, man.

47:25.220 --> 47:26.744
Go on then.

47:29.857 --> 47:33.350
- Why is he always on our hype, man?
- He thinks he's big, man.

47:33.962 --> 47:36.521
- Hey, can I help you?
- Do you work here?

47:36.732 --> 47:38.722
No, sorry,
just making conversation.

47:39.734 --> 47:41.793
I wouldn't buy
these trainers, though.

47:42.204 --> 47:44.866
- Seriously, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

47:45.140 --> 47:46.774
Well, the front always comes off.

47:46.775 --> 47:49.141
Plus, those are the old ones.
New ones are upstairs.

47:51.881 --> 47:53.178
Trevor.

47:55.817 --> 47:56.682
Stella.

48:02.457 --> 48:05.756
- Want a zoot, blood?
- Yeah. Come, we get out of here, man.

48:06.762 --> 48:08.330
You know I could have got
the number though, isn't it?

48:08.331 --> 48:10.265
- So could I, blood.
- I don't think so, blood.

48:11.100 --> 48:13.659
You look smart...
What do you do?

48:13.902 --> 48:17.429
Smart. That's a new one.
What... like smartly dressed?

48:17.706 --> 48:20.402
- No, clever, intelligent.
- Thank you.

48:22.611 --> 48:23.874
I'm an architect.

48:24.947 --> 48:26.914
Rings? You married?

48:28.316 --> 48:29.783
Yeah, my...

48:30.418 --> 48:32.318
husband's been away
a while.

48:32.654 --> 48:35.214
If I was your husband,
I'd never leave you.

48:35.423 --> 48:37.515
And I don't need Viagra,
you know.

48:37.693 --> 48:38.886
Thank you...

48:39.794 --> 48:41.386
that's useful to know.

48:42.831 --> 48:44.890
Don't you get lonely
by yourself?

48:46.202 --> 48:47.361
Yeah.

48:48.537 --> 48:49.902
Yeah. I do.

48:51.706 --> 48:54.368
Actually, sometimes I could use
a bit of company.

48:54.644 --> 48:57.077
- I'd keep you company.
- I bet you would.

49:01.683 --> 49:04.083
- How old are you?
- How old are you?

49:04.653 --> 49:06.211
Twenty-six. You?

49:06.454 --> 49:09.355
- I'm twenty-three.
- You're not twenty-three.

49:09.625 --> 49:11.752
All right, I'm twenty-two,
but I'm mature, man.

49:11.961 --> 49:14.623
- Twenty-two? Really?
- All right, I'm twenty, I swear.

49:15.965 --> 49:18.132
It's not like I'm trying it on
or anything.

49:18.133 --> 49:19.430
Good.

49:21.336 --> 49:23.566
Because I wouldn't want
to disappoint you.

49:36.318 --> 49:38.052
My girl puts onion in my burger.

49:38.054 --> 49:39.589
But, blood, man, you shouldn't have
thrown it, though, isn't it?

49:39.590 --> 49:40.855
She didn't do what I asked.

49:40.856 --> 49:42.157
You should have gave
the burger to me, blood, man.

49:42.158 --> 49:46.151
- Man, I don't like onions.
- Hey, what happened, man?

49:46.395 --> 49:49.125
She's a cock tease, man. She's on it,
and then she ducked, isn't it?

49:49.332 --> 49:51.959
That's a bit weird. White girls
usually fuck you for a browns.

49:52.168 --> 49:54.234
- I knew you wouldn't get that, rude boy.
- Standard.

49:54.236 --> 49:57.569
Shut up, man. I'm still gonna bang
that when I go see her.

49:57.773 --> 49:59.774
How are you gonna bang her, blood
and go see her when she kicked out.

49:59.775 --> 50:01.876
Are you stupid or something?

50:01.877 --> 50:02.968
No.

50:03.212 --> 50:04.873
I got this,
and I'm gonna bring it to her.

50:05.114 --> 50:05.947
Hey, blood, hold him,
hold him, hold him.

50:05.948 --> 50:07.949
Jay, I beg you, pass it back, man.
Hey, Moons, Moons, Moons. Hey, Jay.

50:07.951 --> 50:11.010
Blood, she got plenty dollars in here,
you know. And she's a...

50:14.223 --> 50:16.123
Boy! What the fuck are you doing, man?
Where are you going?

50:16.359 --> 50:18.059
- Leave it. Leave it out, he's a youth.
- Or what, coz?

50:18.060 --> 50:20.688
Or else I'll bust you in your head
you fucking white pussyhole!

50:20.763 --> 50:22.424
What? Blood, you think because
I'm white, I won't knock you out?

50:22.665 --> 50:24.029
Is that right, blood?
Yo, let me take my hat off.

50:24.266 --> 50:25.632
How about white boy,
skinhead nutter, mate?

50:25.868 --> 50:27.631
Does that work better for you,
dickhead?

50:30.439 --> 50:31.667
Oi.

50:37.346 --> 50:39.405
- Shit.
- That's really good though, cousin.

50:41.718 --> 50:43.241
What, man,
you think that scares me?

50:44.921 --> 50:46.410
Man, you don't even know me.

50:47.890 --> 50:49.585
Low it low it, come on, come on.

50:49.825 --> 50:52.055
Just get out of here, man.
You men got murked, like.

50:57.066 --> 50:59.500
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- What are you talking about?

50:59.703 --> 51:02.330
You! Starting fights
in the middle of the street, man.

51:02.505 --> 51:03.505
I was backing you up, blood.

51:03.506 --> 51:05.030
That's not what
I'm talking about, blood.

51:05.241 --> 51:07.072
If we plan something together,
that's cool.

51:07.276 --> 51:08.843
But that was under control
until you started, man.

51:08.845 --> 51:10.613
You can't just start arms house
in the middle of the street.

51:10.614 --> 51:12.614
- What's wrong with you, blood?
- Just cool it, Jay, man.

51:12.615 --> 51:14.616
All right, man.
So where's the purse?

51:14.617 --> 51:17.280
Wait, blood. I told you, yeah,
I want the fucking cards, isn't it.

51:17.486 --> 51:19.021
No, man, who fucking took it?
Give me the purse!

51:19.022 --> 51:20.181
Blood, man, you want,
you want the cards, yeah?

51:20.423 --> 51:21.685
- Yes, I want the fucking cards.
- You want the cards.

51:21.891 --> 51:23.483
- Hey, Moons. Moons.
- Hey, blood, don't fuck about.

51:23.760 --> 51:25.455
So what, you can share
your girl with Sam...

51:25.629 --> 51:26.696
and you can't even share
the purse with us, blood.

51:26.697 --> 51:28.324
You fucking prick.

51:29.633 --> 51:31.601
- Get the fuck off me!
- Fuck is wrong with you, blood?

51:31.768 --> 51:33.292
We're gonna split that or not?
All right, that's what it's got to?

51:33.537 --> 51:37.028
You know what, take your fucking
purse, you like it so much.

51:37.307 --> 51:38.534
You're a dickhead, man.

51:38.641 --> 51:40.438
Hey, blood,
don't take it out on us...

51:40.744 --> 51:42.678
because your girl
got pressed by next man.

51:43.046 --> 51:44.780
If you was somebody else, I would have
stabbed your claret, rude boy!

51:44.781 --> 51:47.409
Stab me then, blood!
My uncle'll kill you!

51:47.616 --> 51:50.347
You and your fucking uncle, man!
If my man's even real.

51:50.586 --> 51:53.077
You know what, blood, if he is real,
yeah, you better go to him, isn't it?

51:53.155 --> 51:55.851
Because, blood, you ain't got no-one
no more, man. You ain't got Alisa.

51:56.060 --> 51:57.651
You ain't got that sket no more.

51:57.894 --> 52:00.658
And we ain't backing you no more.
Come, Moons, man.

52:00.864 --> 52:04.993
Hey, who the fuck you chatting to, man?
Without me, you two ain't shit!

52:05.202 --> 52:07.101
And Alisa, I can have her if I want,
but I don't need her.

52:07.303 --> 52:09.104
I don't need pussyhole friends
like you, either.

52:09.105 --> 52:10.937
Yeah, you keep telling
yourself that, blood.

52:11.141 --> 52:14.810
Remember, we might call you Trife
but your name's Trevor.

52:14.811 --> 52:17.177
- Remember that, blood.
- Come, we jet, blood.

52:47.778 --> 52:50.508
Claire, honey,
Sam's here to see you.

52:53.150 --> 52:54.947
Thanks, Mrs. Parkinson.

52:55.286 --> 52:57.310
I'll leave you kids to it.

53:03.160 --> 53:04.627
- Where are they?
- Who?

53:05.162 --> 53:08.290
Don't try to boy me off,
them three little pussyholes.

53:08.532 --> 53:09.691
I don't know.

53:10.768 --> 53:12.963
I'm only gonna ask you this
one more time.

53:13.170 --> 53:15.035
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

53:15.272 --> 53:16.467
Jeez.

53:18.508 --> 53:20.576
Listen, yeah.
My mum nearly broke her arm.

53:20.577 --> 53:22.943
You better start talking,
or I'm gonna bang you up, you hear me?

53:23.146 --> 53:26.673
When we get to school, I'm gonna tell
everyone what a rubbish fuck you are.

53:26.884 --> 53:29.785
And how bad you smell.
If you know what I'm saying.

53:30.021 --> 53:32.649
Please, don't, I really don't know
where they are.

53:32.856 --> 53:36.019
All I know is that they're going to
that party tonight.

53:37.294 --> 53:39.091
That's where they're gonna be.

53:40.698 --> 53:42.688
So why weren't I invited?

53:42.867 --> 53:45.563
Because no-one
that's going likes you.

53:48.738 --> 53:51.502
Sam, stop, please.
I'm sorry.

53:52.442 --> 53:53.137
Claire?

53:53.945 --> 53:55.411
Claire, baby, are you all right?

53:57.315 --> 53:58.680
Yeah, mum, I'm fine.

53:59.717 --> 54:02.208
Me and Sam are just talking.

54:02.386 --> 54:03.045
Okay.

54:03.820 --> 54:05.754
Use a condom,
sweetheart.

54:07.057 --> 54:09.026
That brings me
to my next question.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.559
Whose girl are you?

54:11.929 --> 54:13.829
Because I don't even know
why I bother with you.

54:14.098 --> 54:17.901
You're ugly, you're a shit fuck, and
you're with me, like sixth-form top boy.

54:17.902 --> 54:20.894
If it weren't for me,
who would even look at you?

54:21.138 --> 54:22.366
I don't know.

54:24.107 --> 54:26.876
- Why did you sleep with Alisa?
- Why'd you fuck that fucking Jay?

54:26.878 --> 54:28.869
In my drum as well!

54:29.280 --> 54:31.008
I don't know. I'm sorry.

54:32.049 --> 54:33.606
It's all right, it's all right.

54:34.719 --> 54:38.519
It's just... I do everything you want,
whenever you want me to.

54:38.756 --> 54:42.214
So why are you mean to me
and all that? I don't understand.

54:45.263 --> 54:46.594
Come here.

55:19.463 --> 55:22.728
Okay, so Plaza, yeah?
In an hour.

55:22.967 --> 55:25.128
- All right, then. Bye.
- Right, see you then. Bye.

55:31.143 --> 55:32.667
Come fuck on, man.

55:34.979 --> 55:38.710
Look, what you need is
some retail therapy, yeah?

55:38.983 --> 55:41.918
Alisa says to meet her in the cafe thing
downstairs in one hour.

55:42.087 --> 55:44.154
What, did you tell her
that Trife ain't here?

55:44.155 --> 55:45.145
No.

55:45.390 --> 55:46.456
Are you a fool or something,
blood?

55:46.457 --> 55:48.726
You don't think she really wants
to chat to you, do you?

55:48.727 --> 55:49.784
I don't know.

55:49.995 --> 55:52.929
You know, fuck it isn't it, I'll tell her,
I'll give her a piece of my mind, man.

55:52.930 --> 55:53.897
You get me?

55:58.603 --> 56:01.628
Oh my God, that dress looks dark
on you. Is that the one you want?

56:01.840 --> 56:03.239
Yeah, I think so.

56:03.441 --> 56:05.467
Well, I got all these.
I can't make my mind up.

56:05.711 --> 56:07.143
We are gonna be the hottest girls
there tonight.

56:07.244 --> 56:09.338
Everyone else is gonna look like
tramps compared to us.

56:09.581 --> 56:12.415
Hi, madam, can I help?
Is that the dress you like?

56:12.417 --> 56:13.816
- Yeah.
- It looks great on you.

56:14.052 --> 56:16.654
Well, if you pull your
hair back like this...

56:16.655 --> 56:18.850
it will accentuate
your fabulous figure.

56:19.191 --> 56:21.021
- Thank you.
- Nice figure?

56:21.226 --> 56:22.893
Not for long.
She's knocked up.

56:22.894 --> 56:25.521
Congratulations.
My wife is pregnant.

56:25.963 --> 56:28.898
- Wife? I thought you were a batty man.
- Excuse me?

56:29.234 --> 56:30.861
- Ain't you gay?
- No.

56:31.102 --> 56:33.298
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- I know, I'm just saying.

56:33.538 --> 56:35.597
- All right, calm down, Yankee.
- I'm Canadian.

56:35.806 --> 56:38.071
- Same thing.
- Excuse me, how much is this one?

56:38.576 --> 56:40.806
This one is a hundred
and thirty pounds.

56:42.382 --> 56:43.541
Becks?

56:52.323 --> 56:53.985
Well, I want this one.
How much is it?

56:58.530 --> 57:00.725
This one is two hundred
and ten pounds.

57:01.733 --> 57:04.827
Lis, can you not find another one?
I really want this one.

57:05.002 --> 57:07.437
- We've got three hundred between us.
- Yeah, and you said you'd split it.

57:07.639 --> 57:09.334
Look, who got the money?

57:09.541 --> 57:12.373
I'm doing you a favour
in the first place by getting you one.

57:12.477 --> 57:14.478
Come on, soon you'll have
a big fat belly anyway.

57:14.479 --> 57:15.970
You won't be able to wear it.

57:16.214 --> 57:19.115
You've still got ninety quid.
I'm sure you can get something nice.

57:19.317 --> 57:20.251
Don't worry, honey.

57:20.252 --> 57:22.846
I'll find you something to make
you look even more fabulous.

58:39.265 --> 58:41.232
- Trevor?
- Yeah.

58:42.034 --> 58:43.364
He'll be with you in a sec.

58:45.338 --> 58:47.306
You're a handsome one,
aren't you?

59:03.956 --> 59:05.116
Trevor.

59:06.058 --> 59:08.925
- What happen?
- You told me to reach.

59:09.762 --> 59:11.627
Debbie look after you?

59:12.397 --> 59:13.490
Yeah.

59:18.971 --> 59:20.165
Come.

59:21.107 --> 59:23.905
Me like the work you did
on that thing.

59:26.811 --> 59:27.869
This...

59:29.282 --> 59:30.681
is for you.

59:34.554 --> 59:35.953
See, I told you I would, man.

59:36.155 --> 59:37.355
If you want me to do
anything else, I'm...

59:37.356 --> 59:39.414
Just cool yourself, man.

59:48.134 --> 59:49.658
What's that?

59:50.671 --> 59:52.069
Heroin.

59:53.773 --> 59:56.435
- You want some?
- I'm cool, man.

59:57.576 --> 59:58.737
Go on...

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:02.011
take some.

01:00:15.395 --> 01:00:17.124
You grow fast, man.

01:00:18.731 --> 01:00:20.028
Anyway...

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.365
me like the work
you did on the gun.

01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:26.030
- It's easy, I can...
- Don't speak, just listen.

01:00:30.777 --> 01:00:31.800
You know...

01:00:32.846 --> 01:00:35.781
all you need in this world
is money...

01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:40.007
and if you know how to get it,
you laughing.

01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:43.720
- You seen that nice TV in my front room?
- Yeah.

01:00:43.923 --> 01:00:47.654
You got one? No? But you'd like one,
of course you would.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.586
Curtis, I've got Keith
on the phone. He wants you to...

01:00:50.831 --> 01:00:53.061
Tell him that I talk to my nephew.
Tell him wait.

01:00:53.299 --> 01:00:55.631
But he's already on the phone.
He says he's...

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:58.203
Me said tell him wait.

01:01:07.246 --> 01:01:08.236
Anyway...

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:15.846
why you don't come work for,
with me?

01:01:16.857 --> 01:01:20.156
Trust me, I want to, man.
Fucking had enough of everything else.

01:01:22.296 --> 01:01:25.264
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Just a few little things.

01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:27.489
That sounds like something
you can do?

01:01:28.234 --> 01:01:30.600
Sounds live, man.
I'm there.

01:01:30.804 --> 01:01:32.567
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:32.806 --> 01:01:35.638
Me did sell the last
of the bad guns to some youth.

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:38.802
Me have more of the replicas
for you to drill in the back.

01:01:39.012 --> 01:01:40.445
In the meantime...

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:47.008
you did so well with this one
that me think you should have it.

01:02:10.711 --> 01:02:12.372
- So where is he?
- I told you.

01:02:12.913 --> 01:02:15.848
When he switched, yeah,
we just kicked out and left him, man.

01:02:16.117 --> 01:02:18.482
And don't bother trying to call him,
because his phone's off.

01:02:18.685 --> 01:02:20.017
Look, I really need
to speak to him.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.654
Listen up, everybody.

01:02:22.923 --> 01:02:24.083
Me say listen up.

01:02:26.193 --> 01:02:28.683
This is my nephew Trevor.

01:02:29.096 --> 01:02:33.088
Real family member that will be joining
our family from now on...

01:02:33.266 --> 01:02:36.133
so, treat him nice.

01:02:36.437 --> 01:02:37.698
What going on, bro?

01:02:41.475 --> 01:02:44.273
What's up with this baby shit, man?
Is this true or something?

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:46.536
Of course it's true.
Who's gonna lie about being pregnant?

01:02:46.714 --> 01:02:49.182
- Nuff people, man.
- Well, I'm not lying.

01:02:49.384 --> 01:02:50.584
All you do is lie.

01:02:50.585 --> 01:02:52.818
And now you've been caught out, you're
trying to drag Trife back into this.

01:02:52.819 --> 01:02:54.310
Try and fuck up his life,
isn't it?

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.319
Look, I think I should be speaking
to him about this, not you.

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.047
You are talking to me.

01:02:58.258 --> 01:03:00.021
And what exactly
are you gonna say to him?

01:03:00.093 --> 01:03:02.891
"I'm sorry, Trife I fucked another guy
while I was with you."

01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:04.831
Because it don't matter
because he knows now.

01:03:04.832 --> 01:03:06.299
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:10.435
Listen, Trevor.

01:03:11.938 --> 01:03:14.634
Come, I want you to handle
something for me.

01:03:20.648 --> 01:03:22.342
You're bad, isn't it?

01:03:26.988 --> 01:03:28.545
You behave yourselves, yeah?

01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:36.318
Anything?

01:03:36.998 --> 01:03:40.957
You see, this is the reason
me want you to come work for me.

01:03:41.368 --> 01:03:43.302
- Curtis.
- Shut up!

01:03:43.837 --> 01:03:45.738
You see this fucker?

01:03:45.939 --> 01:03:48.806
Him take my property,
but my money never come back.

01:03:51.879 --> 01:03:54.279
Where the fuck is my money,
nigger?

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.446
I can get it for you, man.

01:03:57.218 --> 01:04:00.353
It's at my place. I told you
I was gonna bring it round later today.

01:04:00.354 --> 01:04:01.821
Hey, shut your mouth, blood.

01:04:02.056 --> 01:04:04.456
If he wanted it when you decided to
bring it and not when he asked for it...

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:07.492
you wouldn't be tied
to a fucking table, would you?

01:04:13.133 --> 01:04:14.725
What are you waiting for?

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.603
I'm sorry.
Please, I'm sorry.

01:04:21.809 --> 01:04:23.243
You know what, boy?

01:04:23.544 --> 01:04:25.944
I want you
to get my money today.

01:04:26.147 --> 01:04:27.477
- I will.
- But before you go...

01:04:27.747 --> 01:04:31.343
I'm gonna make sure you remember
that you don't fuck with Curtis.

01:04:37.225 --> 01:04:38.283
Trevor...

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:45.121
I want you to carve a C from the corner
of him eye to the corner of him mouth.

01:04:48.169 --> 01:04:49.603
- Me?
- Yes...

01:04:49.872 --> 01:04:51.066
you.

01:04:58.779 --> 01:05:02.374
I want you
to carve a blood clotline...

01:05:02.985 --> 01:05:05.579
from here to here.

01:05:08.189 --> 01:05:10.282
Carve the fucking line.

01:05:17.432 --> 01:05:19.491
No, let him.

01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:21.560
Cut him.

01:05:22.204 --> 01:05:23.192
Man.

01:05:23.672 --> 01:05:25.764
Man, please!

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.301
Please!

01:05:30.444 --> 01:05:31.570
No.

01:05:39.121 --> 01:05:39.984
No!

01:06:04.146 --> 01:06:05.545
Good.

01:06:09.318 --> 01:06:11.217
Trevor... come.

01:06:11.887 --> 01:06:13.115
Come here.

01:06:14.323 --> 01:06:14.845
Trevor!

01:06:26.034 --> 01:06:27.331
Please.

01:06:46.121 --> 01:06:48.254
The best thing you
could do right now is fuck off...

01:06:48.256 --> 01:06:50.157
and get an abortion of Sam's baby.

01:06:50.326 --> 01:06:52.658
Because he don't want you,
and Trife don't want you either.

01:06:53.463 --> 01:06:54.588
What, has he said that?

01:06:54.796 --> 01:06:57.924
- Who wants a sket like you?
- Has he told you he don't want me.

01:06:58.633 --> 01:07:00.465
Yeah.
Now fuck off, isn't it.

01:07:05.907 --> 01:07:08.274
What's up with your girlfriend,
though? Fucking Sam.

01:07:08.444 --> 01:07:10.969
No wonder Trife dashed her, man,
she's a fucking ho like.

01:07:11.079 --> 01:07:13.274
I know.
I couldn't be like that.

01:07:13.482 --> 01:07:15.780
Only give my things
to special mans like you.

01:07:16.018 --> 01:07:17.417
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:07:17.719 --> 01:07:18.947
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:07:19.155 --> 01:07:20.815
Becks, can we go?

01:07:21.356 --> 01:07:24.383
- Where, to the party?
- No, I just wanna go home.

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.623
Well, I'm not ready.

01:07:27.429 --> 01:07:30.489
- Becky, please, can we just go?
- Look, go if you wanna go.

01:07:30.732 --> 01:07:34.259
Don't come to the party tonight, be a
boring cow. I'm staying with this lot.

01:07:37.873 --> 01:07:40.034
You know what,
just do what you want, yeah?

01:07:43.746 --> 01:07:44.803
Fat cunt.

01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:30.377
I fucked that g¡rl
a few weeks ago, blood.

01:09:30.787 --> 01:09:33.312
Every day for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.

01:09:33.523 --> 01:09:34.546
Why aren't you speaking to me?

01:10:58.141 --> 01:11:00.109
So this party, where is it?

01:11:00.444 --> 01:11:02.605
You're not still gonna go,
are you?

01:11:03.313 --> 01:11:06.440
You saw what they done to my mum.
Where is it?

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.677
Nice invite.

01:11:10.921 --> 01:11:13.185
- I don't think you should go.
- Why not?

01:11:13.423 --> 01:11:17.052
I just think this thing with them lot
should stop or someone's gonna get hurt.

01:11:17.294 --> 01:11:19.660
Your mum's all right
and you got me.

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:22.592
Stay here tonight,
we can fuck all night.

01:11:23.268 --> 01:11:24.894
Promise me you'll stay.

01:11:28.405 --> 01:11:30.032
All right, I promise.

01:11:30.274 --> 01:11:33.107
I just wanna go home and check on
my mum, make sure she's all right.

01:11:35.012 --> 01:11:37.810
- Cool. I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

01:11:44.922 --> 01:11:45.946
Alisa!

01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:47.748
Alisa!

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:49.990
Wait. Alisa!

01:11:53.697 --> 01:11:56.997
- What you doing?
- I'm going home. I only live over there.

01:11:58.201 --> 01:12:00.135
- Your hand's bleeding, are you okay?
- Oh, shit.

01:12:00.337 --> 01:12:01.565
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:05.442 --> 01:12:07.535
- Have you been crying?
- No.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:10.904
You look like you have.

01:12:12.784 --> 01:12:14.751
Are you coming to Blake's party?

01:12:14.985 --> 01:12:16.577
Oh, no, I'm really n
in the mood.

01:12:17.554 --> 01:12:19.351
Come on, come with us.

01:12:19.656 --> 01:12:20.884
I don't know.

01:12:21.124 --> 01:12:23.559
You look like you need to be around
some friends to cheer yourself up.

01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:24.492
Yeah.

01:12:24.696 --> 01:12:28.290
I promise I'll do anything I can
to get you smiling again.

01:12:28.632 --> 01:12:30.191
And how are you gonna do that?

01:12:35.605 --> 01:12:37.072
Come on, come with me.

01:12:38.309 --> 01:12:40.744
Okay. Let me just go home
and get changed, yeah?

01:12:40.745 --> 01:12:43.611
But I'm only gonna come, like,
if I can hang out with you.

01:13:03.868 --> 01:13:06.165
H¡, th¡s ¡s Al¡sa.
Please, leave...

01:13:37.503 --> 01:13:41.529
Trife... enter, my friend.
While the parents are away and what not.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.335
Want some of this?
It's Cuban.

01:13:48.046 --> 01:13:49.308
Where's Alisa?

01:13:49.679 --> 01:13:52.240
She's inside.
I think she went into the garden.

01:14:46.538 --> 01:14:47.629
Bruv...

01:14:48.506 --> 01:14:50.065
blood, sorry, man.

01:14:50.309 --> 01:14:51.570
I'll see you later.

01:14:51.843 --> 01:14:53.208
Sorry, bruv.

01:14:55.414 --> 01:14:58.008
- What you doing?
- So, what, he's your man now?

01:14:58.216 --> 01:15:01.310
No, but at least he's been nice to me
today. Look, what do you want?

01:15:02.487 --> 01:15:04.148
I wanted to say hello, isn't it.

01:15:04.322 --> 01:15:06.587
- Hello.
- How you doing?

01:15:07.126 --> 01:15:09.259
If you wanna say something to me,
then say it and leave me alone.

01:15:09.261 --> 01:15:11.627
- Hey, what happened to your hand?
- I got it cut.

01:15:11.729 --> 01:15:13.698
- Are you all right?
- It's fine.

01:15:14.499 --> 01:15:16.262
No, are you all right?

01:15:19.605 --> 01:15:22.732
- So what do you do today?
- Nothing that would interest you.

01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:28.378
Look, Lis, can we go somewhere
a bit more private, please?

01:15:50.469 --> 01:15:51.801
So, what, where is he, then?

01:15:51.802 --> 01:15:53.770
I don't know, I just saw him
come out here.

01:15:54.306 --> 01:15:55.506
I'm going back in, man. This is...

01:15:55.507 --> 01:15:57.702
I don't know why
I come to your party, man.

01:16:01.046 --> 01:16:04.776
- So what time you staying till?
- Cool, baby, we just got here, like.

01:16:05.017 --> 01:16:08.110
True, it'll probably
get better later.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.020
Would be better
if Blake weren't such a chief.

01:16:10.022 --> 01:16:11.183
Look at him trying
to friends up Jay.

01:16:11.457 --> 01:16:15.017
I mean... I'd consider this
a success, wouldn't you?

01:16:17.496 --> 01:16:19.623
Jay, did I mention
how sharp you look.

01:16:21.333 --> 01:16:22.857
Go away, Blake.

01:16:27.607 --> 01:16:30.507
I know you tried to speak to me earlier
and I didn't want to listen...

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:33.501
but I wanna talk to you now.

01:16:33.712 --> 01:16:37.306
Look, don't worry about your little
life, Trevor, I don't need your help.

01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:40.841
And I'm sorry you had to hear
what you heard from Sam...

01:16:41.053 --> 01:16:42.316
and I understand
that you don't want me...

01:16:42.388 --> 01:16:44.322
but I thought you ought to know
that I never slept with...

01:16:44.524 --> 01:16:49.017
All right. I know you never meant
to hurt me and blah, blah...

01:16:49.495 --> 01:16:51.262
but before you carry on there's some
things I need to get off my head...

01:16:51.263 --> 01:16:53.030
and if I don't,
I'm just gonna forget.

01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:54.692
- Look, Trevor, you don't...
- Wait...

01:16:58.938 --> 01:17:00.928
I'm on that, boy.

01:17:01.473 --> 01:17:03.964
Excuse me, you came with me.

01:17:04.243 --> 01:17:07.440
No, there's a difference.
You came with me.

01:17:08.513 --> 01:17:10.777
But don't worry, though,
babes, like...

01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:12.784
there's enough Moonies
to go around, isn't it, like.

01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:14.248
So safe, yeah?

01:17:14.721 --> 01:17:16.551
Yeah, Danielle,
what's going on then, man?

01:17:16.789 --> 01:17:18.653
I see you at school the other day.
I wanted to come and talk to you...

01:17:18.857 --> 01:17:20.449
but you're always with
your friends, man.

01:17:20.627 --> 01:17:22.651
- You can still come up to me.
- No, but I don't like...

01:17:22.894 --> 01:17:24.225
Please.

01:17:25.999 --> 01:17:28.229
Danielle, I'm gonna come
chat to you in a sec, yeah?

01:17:28.534 --> 01:17:30.626
So, with both your little buddies
doing there own thing...

01:17:30.703 --> 01:17:32.636
is there anything
that you wanna do?

01:17:33.005 --> 01:17:34.267
Like what?

01:17:34.407 --> 01:17:35.771
Like me.

01:17:36.041 --> 01:17:37.167
What?

01:17:37.509 --> 01:17:39.534
Do you want to fuck me?

01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:42.437
No, not really, I got a girl.

01:17:42.614 --> 01:17:44.310
So? I won't tell her.

01:17:44.784 --> 01:17:46.149
I thought you liked Moony?

01:17:46.252 --> 01:17:48.344
No, I like you.

01:17:48.821 --> 01:17:50.447
He's a bit of a fool.

01:17:50.657 --> 01:17:51.988
That's one of my best friends
you're talking about down there.

01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:53.992
Look, do you wanna fuck or not?

01:17:55.828 --> 01:18:00.128
You can put it in my arse as well.
It hurts, but I don't mind.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.168
No, low it, man.
Hey, Danielle.

01:18:09.142 --> 01:18:10.335
What I wanted to say ¡s th¡s.

01:18:10.843 --> 01:18:13.141
I know we were only going out
for a couple of months...

01:18:14.213 --> 01:18:18.616
but it was fun, dred. You made me feel
like feel good, you get me?

01:18:19.118 --> 01:18:22.814
I mean, not just sex. I mean, your
things feel good and everything, but...

01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:25.787
you.

01:18:27.827 --> 01:18:28.919
It was you.

01:18:29.563 --> 01:18:33.293
But I didn't know what to do when you
started wanting hugs and that in school.

01:18:33.499 --> 01:18:36.866
I started thinking about what the boys
would think and them stupidness there.

01:18:37.402 --> 01:18:41.099
When I broke up with you,
I realised I was stupid.

01:18:41.908 --> 01:18:44.433
I told everyone, "I ain't going back
out with her", but...

01:18:45.378 --> 01:18:46.743
I wanted to.

01:18:49.716 --> 01:18:52.984
When I found out you fucked Sam,
it hurt me.

01:18:52.985 --> 01:18:54.885
- Look, Trevor...
- Wait.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.290
That hurt me.

01:19:00.627 --> 01:19:02.685
That's why I said
what I said today.

01:19:04.597 --> 01:19:06.292
I've seen some shit today...

01:19:08.468 --> 01:19:10.663
makes me think about life.

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:15.039
You're one of the best things
in mine.

01:19:17.677 --> 01:19:20.237
So even though
it's some next man's baby...

01:19:22.248 --> 01:19:23.909
I wanna be with you.

01:19:25.084 --> 01:19:27.109
And I wanna look after
you both.

01:19:27.286 --> 01:19:29.187
I wanna change for you.

01:19:31.357 --> 01:19:32.620
Because...

01:19:38.264 --> 01:19:39.561
I love you.

01:19:42.703 --> 01:19:44.804
Why you laughing?
I said I love you.

01:19:44.805 --> 01:19:47.968
- Trevor, I never slept with Sam.
- What?

01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:49.702
I've been trying to tell you.

01:19:50.176 --> 01:19:52.912
He lied. He told everyone
I went to his house.

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:53.913
He said I might as well go...

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.642
because he was gonna
tell everyone he fucked me, but...

01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:58.677
I never, I swear.

01:19:59.453 --> 01:20:00.852
So, the baby...

01:20:01.688 --> 01:20:04.815
You're the only one I've slept with.
It's yours.

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:09.191
- What's wrong?
- Shit.

01:20:10.296 --> 01:20:13.459
- My mum's gonna kill me, man.
- Mine too.

01:20:30.818 --> 01:20:34.117
Listen, listen, we're gonna work, yeah?
We'll stay together forever.

01:20:35.355 --> 01:20:36.981
I'm not sure we will...

01:20:37.323 --> 01:20:40.622
but we're gonna have this baby,
so, we should try.

01:20:43.998 --> 01:20:45.794
Yeah, pussyhole, what now?

01:20:45.999 --> 01:20:47.660
- You think you're a man? Get up.
- Sam don't!

01:20:47.901 --> 01:20:50.768
No... you think you're bad?
You wanna act like a big man?

01:20:51.238 --> 01:20:53.706
I'm gonna beat you
like a fucking big man!

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:58.240
Where's your two boys? Because you
three pussyholes are finished tonight!

01:21:00.581 --> 01:21:02.348
We can work something out,
I swear to you.

01:21:02.349 --> 01:21:03.416
Fuck...

01:21:03.417 --> 01:21:06.648
- Sam, man, fucking hell, what you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:19.792
Moony! Jay, look, Sam's beating up
Trife outside, right now!

01:21:21.969 --> 01:21:25.538
- So, what, are you gonna back us or what?
- No, he's your mate, blood.

01:21:25.539 --> 01:21:26.335
You pussy!

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.198
You must have lost
your fucking mind fucking with me.

01:21:28.443 --> 01:21:30.206
We can work something, I swear to you.
Hey, Jay, don't, man.

01:21:30.278 --> 01:21:32.211
Hey, blood,
get the fuck off him, man.

01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:38.583
I'm sorry.

01:21:39.453 --> 01:21:41.250
Come on then... Come, come.

01:21:41.488 --> 01:21:42.785
Hey, low it, man, low it.

01:21:45.093 --> 01:21:46.650
Yeah, you are.

01:21:50.831 --> 01:21:54.198
You wanna disrespect my mum?
You wanna fuck my girl?

01:22:02.076 --> 01:22:04.670
You're not fucking real,
blood, you hear me?

01:22:05.445 --> 01:22:07.140
Stay down!

01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:08.871
All you fucking pussyholes, yeah.

01:22:08.949 --> 01:22:10.883
Any of you fuck with me, this is what
you get, you understand, blood?

01:22:11.084 --> 01:22:13.109
Just leave us alone, Sam.

01:22:13.422 --> 01:22:15.389
Everyone knows
you never fucked me.

01:22:15.623 --> 01:22:17.716
What are you gonna do,
beat us all up?

01:22:17.959 --> 01:22:19.425
Who'd wanna fuck you anyway?
Look at you.

01:22:19.426 --> 01:22:21.792
- Shut up.
- Suck my dick, you fucking bitch.

01:22:30.405 --> 01:22:33.238
Hey, don't fucking touch her!
Fuck you! You fucking prick.

01:22:33.474 --> 01:22:35.101
Fucking dickhead.

01:22:38.112 --> 01:22:40.477
Trife, get off him, please.

01:22:41.548 --> 01:22:43.743
I thought you were gonna change?

01:22:46.654 --> 01:22:48.485
Listen to your bitch, Trevor.

01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:03.562
Trife, Trife, man!

01:23:16.085 --> 01:23:18.075
Something's wrong with Trife!

01:23:19.387 --> 01:23:21.048
Are you all right, blood?

01:23:22.724 --> 01:23:24.692
Someone call an ambulance, man.

01:23:24.925 --> 01:23:26.154
Hey, pussyhole!

01:23:33.201 --> 01:23:35.864
Blood. Blood, low it, man,
Trife's hurt.

01:23:39.674 --> 01:23:41.869
Low it. He's bleeding.
It's gonna be all right, coz?

01:23:42.543 --> 01:23:45.376
- Call a fucking ambulance!
- I've already called one.

01:23:46.614 --> 01:23:49.208
What you gonna do, blood?
What you gonna do?

01:23:56.557 --> 01:23:57.888
Shit!

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:01.652
Who the fuck is Sam? Hey, you better
tell me who the fuck Sam is, now, man!

01:24:02.398 --> 01:24:04.831
You better start fucking talking
because I know he's fucking here!

01:24:05.034 --> 01:24:06.864
Who the fuck is Sam?

01:24:07.101 --> 01:24:08.467
Baby, baby, listen...

01:24:08.703 --> 01:24:11.831
we'll go out on the weekend, yeah?
Me and you, we'll do something nice.

01:24:11.973 --> 01:24:13.531
Tell me now!

01:24:14.009 --> 01:24:17.136
Blood... Sam's not here,
you know, he's not here.

01:24:17.379 --> 01:24:18.471
He's Sam!

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.611
What the fuck you talking about,
you fat bitch? Just...

01:24:23.719 --> 01:24:26.448
I don't know who you are, coz,
I don't know.

01:24:28.389 --> 01:24:29.912
Do you know
my little sister Katie?

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.627
- Oh, shit, it's really bad.
- Oh, fuck.

01:24:32.628 --> 01:24:35.061
Trife, you're gonna be all right,
though, coz.

01:24:35.297 --> 01:24:36.889
Better shut the fuck up, man.
Shut up!

01:24:37.432 --> 01:24:39.697
- Get down on your fucking knees, man.
- No, come on, bruv.

01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:42.799
Get down on your fucking knees now.
Put your head on the stone. Fucking cry!

01:24:44.172 --> 01:24:46.901
See, man look at this,
look at this shit.

01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:48.872
I fucking found this shit yesterday,
look at this shit.

01:24:49.144 --> 01:24:52.602
Sam says he's gonna fucking kill me,
so I'm gonna save them all the trouble.

01:24:52.848 --> 01:24:54.975
I'm not even... fuck...
I'm not even scared any more.

01:24:55.417 --> 01:24:59.182
Anything's better than here.
And it fucking goes on, you cunt.

01:24:59.456 --> 01:25:01.150
She was fucking fifteen, man.

01:25:01.491 --> 01:25:03.549
- She was fucking fifteen.
- I never done nothing to her, blood.

01:25:03.759 --> 01:25:06.728
Give me one fucking good reason why
I shouldn't fucking blow your head off.

01:25:06.928 --> 01:25:09.055
You give me one.
Why you shouldn't die.

01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:11.064
Give me one fucking reason
why you shouldn't die!

01:25:14.135 --> 01:25:15.693
Because he's not worth it.

01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:23.500
Baby, baby, it's really bad!

01:25:23.812 --> 01:25:25.177
Oh, fuck. Trife!

01:25:34.556 --> 01:25:37.024
He's stopped breathing! What?
Man, where's the doctor?

01:25:37.226 --> 01:25:38.818
Trife? Trife?

01:25:40.596 --> 01:25:42.655
Let's go, blood, feds.

01:25:43.165 --> 01:25:44.393
Come on.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.496
- Pussyhole!
- You're the pussyhole, man.

01:25:49.271 --> 01:25:51.865
- No, blood. No, blood, blood.
- I beg you, please!

01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:57.439
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Come on, let's go!

01:25:58.478 --> 01:26:01.072
Shit, man. Fucking hell, Derek.
Fuck! Come on.

01:26:01.882 --> 01:26:03.316
No, man.

01:26:15.294 --> 01:26:18.025
What the fuck are you lot
doing, man? Fuck off!

01:26:19.331 --> 01:26:21.061
Fuck you,
you didn't do shit to help, man.

01:26:22.468 --> 01:26:26.599
Fuck off and leave him, blood, man.
Why you around watching now?

01:26:26.806 --> 01:26:30.408
None of you did shit to help, man.
Fuck you lot...

01:26:30.409 --> 01:26:32.878
Get off me, blood.
Get the fuck off me, blood!
