WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:05.406
So get this. The new neighbors
down the block had a party,

00:05.439 --> 00:07.808
and invited everybody
on the street except us.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.478
Great.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.348
What? No. Not great.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.150
I heard it
from that old hermit guy

00:16.184 --> 00:18.152
on the corner
who let all his grass die.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.320
Dirt Yard Bob?

00:20.454 --> 00:23.357
Yeah. They even invited
Dirt Yard Bob.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.359
The guy
that electrocuted himself

00:25.393 --> 00:27.528
trying to get free sneakers
off a power line.

00:30.464 --> 00:34.034
I heard that when he woke up, he
could suddenly play the piano.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.206
We used to get invited
to everything.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.574
I mean, potlucks,
holiday parties.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.776
What happened?
I happened.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.812
I cut the cord with
that bunch of mooches.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.547
:
You're welcome.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.417
Those people were
our friends.
No.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.220
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no. Mooches.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.555
Remember two years ago

00:54.588 --> 00:56.457
when we stayed home
on the Fourth of July?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.559
I got roped into
feeding all their cats.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.594
That's what neighbors do.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.330
You know what cats do?

01:02.363 --> 01:05.499
They hide, and then they
dive at you, claws first.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.135
They get off,
like, six punches

01:07.168 --> 01:09.403
before you know what
the hell happened.
Oh.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.572
Okay, well, remember

01:11.605 --> 01:14.575
when we let the Morrisons park
their boat in our driveway?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.510
Then they split up,
and the husband just

01:16.544 --> 01:17.678
lived on it for weeks.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.881
That thing didn't have a toilet.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.117
Where did he go, Andi?

01:24.318 --> 01:25.819
We'll never know.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.557
Yeah, but now we're outcasts.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.894
I mean, how did you manage
to alienate an entire block?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.164
Well, it was pretty
easy, actually.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.166
You know, whenever someone
would want to make plans,

01:38.199 --> 01:40.568
I'd just say, "Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll have Andi call you."

01:40.601 --> 01:42.536
Then I never
told you to call.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.139
Then, when I'd run
into 'em , I'd say,

01:45.173 --> 01:47.508
"I can't believe
Andi never called you."

01:48.409 --> 01:50.811
VoilÃ .

01:50.844 --> 01:52.546
So I look like the bad guy.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.148
How do you think I feel?

01:54.182 --> 01:56.750
I look like I'm married
to the bad guy.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.287
You know what?
You've become unfriendly.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.754
What?
Mm.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.523
I have not.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.658
The neighbors
were all over us.

02:04.692 --> 02:09.297
When Germany invaded Poland, did
people call Poland unfriendly?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.532
Don't bring Germany
into this, all right?

02:11.565 --> 02:12.833
Every time
you're losing an argument,

02:12.866 --> 02:14.535
you call in the Germans.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.270
What's wrong
with being neighborly?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.472
I just don't get it.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.908
I mean, why do I have to
be buddies with someone

02:20.941 --> 02:24.578
just because of a
geographical coincidence?

02:24.612 --> 02:26.947
You know? I'm sure somebody
lived next to Mussolini.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.950
Were they watching his cat?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.786
And here come the Italians.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.290
Look, bottom line,
I did us a favor.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.925
I can't believe it took
you this long to notice.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.727
Well, I've been busy working.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.562
I just... I wasn't
paying attention.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.898
Oh. I just thought you
were quietly on board.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.568
You know? It's
like upstairs.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.904
If you don't make a face,
I just keep going.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.243
ADAM:
And then Andi said

02:55.276 --> 02:56.677
I was unfriendly.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.280
I was kind of expecting
a thank you.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.681
From your wife?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.516
That's not what they do.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.818
I'm a friendly guy.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.954
I mean, Lowell,
we became friends.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.856
It was the hardest thing
I've ever done,

03:08.889 --> 03:10.524
and I knitted this sweater vest.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.862
I'm looking
for Adam Burns.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.331
Are you a singing telegram?

03:17.365 --> 03:18.799
I am not.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.534
Oh. Then he's over there.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.437
I'm the new county inspector.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.972
I just checked
your concrete slab.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.540
Oh, great. Yeah, as
soon as you sign off,

03:26.574 --> 03:27.741
we can start framing.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.543
I'm not signing off.
It's still wet.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.779
And you knew that
when you called me down here.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.248
The inspector we had
before did it all the time.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.984
He understood the concept
of leeway, you know.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.753
I don't believe in leeway.
I believe in my way.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.723
Oh. Okay.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.725
Look, new lady...
My name's Joy.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.595
Well, somebody
lied to you.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.732
I don't know if
they taught you this

03:51.765 --> 03:53.801
in county inspector school,
but concrete dries, okay?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.769
That's why the sidewalks
aren't full of skeletons

03:55.803 --> 03:57.438
trying to pull
their legs out.

03:57.471 --> 04:00.741
I don't know if they taught
you this in contractor school,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.843
but you don't talk
to me like that.

04:02.876 --> 04:06.747
Joke's on her. I didn't even go
to contractor school.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.383
Okay, look, it's
gonna be two weeks

04:09.417 --> 04:10.851
before that slab
cures all the way.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.753
If you don't sign off,
my guys can't work,

04:12.786 --> 04:14.922
and I'm paying 'em to do
nothing. That's a problem.

04:14.955 --> 04:15.956
That's your problem.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.358
Until you got here,

04:17.391 --> 04:18.792
I didn't have a problem!

04:18.826 --> 04:20.628
Did you just raise
your voice at me?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.796
Well...
I do not take
kindly to that, sir,

04:22.830 --> 04:24.832
because then I am forced
to do the same.

04:24.865 --> 04:29.437
And if this is a talking-loud
competition, I will win it!

04:32.506 --> 04:34.708
: Well, maybe it's
a talking-soft competition,

04:34.742 --> 04:36.410
and I'm winning it.

04:38.045 --> 04:41.048
What? Just send the other
inspector back. He knew me.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.683
Well, I do not know you, sir,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.818
and so far, what I've seen,
I do not like.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.820
You are very unfriendly.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.722
Unfriendly? Wha-What
do you want me to do,

04:48.756 --> 04:50.691
make you a balloon animal?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.494
I've red-tagged a lot of slabs,

04:53.527 --> 04:55.496
and this has given me
the most pleasure.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.699
That's right,
"pleasure," as in "joy."

05:05.939 --> 05:07.074
ADAM:
I can't believe

05:07.107 --> 05:08.876
two people
who don't even know each other

05:08.909 --> 05:10.978
both said I was unfriendly.
Hey,

05:11.011 --> 05:12.746
everybody's born with a certain
amount of friendly in them.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.616
You use most of it
trying to get a wife.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.818
Then you're pretty much
tapped out by 45.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.754
I think of myself
as a friendly guy.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.956
I like to bowl, shoot pool,
play softball.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.859
Mm-hmm. When was the last time
you did any of that?

05:25.893 --> 05:28.061
Uh, well, okay, uh...

05:28.095 --> 05:30.631
Oh, I know. It was...
Uh, no, that was a movie.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.133
No. All right, well,
it's not all my fault.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.536
I mean, we don't even have
a softball team anymore.

05:35.569 --> 05:39.072
Sure we do.
But I quit.
I was the heart of the team.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.774
Well, we had a heart transplant.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.877
I play second base.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.746
I'm learning how to spit
in front of other people.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.981
There was a time
you would have known

05:48.015 --> 05:49.049
about Lowell's struggle
with spitting.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.119
Well...

05:52.152 --> 05:53.921
I mean, maybe Andi's right.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.689
Maybe I have gotten
a little cranky.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.958
She is right.
I can tell you she's right.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.760
And not just with the neighbors.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.896
I mean,
I think the problem is me.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.165
It is. I can tell you it is.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.035
Hmm. You know what? I'm gonna
turn this thing around.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.937
Starting right now, I'm, uh...

06:09.970 --> 06:12.406
I'm rejoining the softball team.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.542
Whoa. Whoa! You can't just
rejoin. You have to try out.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.910
I'm not trying out
for my own company's team.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.112
I like your moxie.
Welcome aboard.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.014
Yeah.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.584
*

06:32.960 --> 06:34.862
Hey.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.830
Well, you were right.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.966
Turns out I'm the town crank.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.001
Oh, honey.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.871
You know, the first step
to getting better is admitting

06:43.904 --> 06:45.639
you have a problem.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.543
And that I'm right.
That's my favorite part.

06:49.577 --> 06:53.514
Okay, well, I am ready
to be friendly, okay?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.949
So let's try and fix things
with those idiot neighbors.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.851
I know.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.721
We'll have a potluck
for the whole street.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.890
Yeah, I-I can make fliers
and-and put 'em

07:02.923 --> 07:04.958
in everybody's mailbox, and...

07:06.259 --> 07:07.861
I'm getting a fruit bouquet.

07:07.895 --> 07:08.962
Great.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.031
No, no. A pineapple swan.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.000
Whatever it takes.

07:13.033 --> 07:17.137
I-I don't want to end
up like Dirt Yard Bob.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.640
Although I would love
to play the piano.

07:20.908 --> 07:24.011
Hey, um, since
you're in the mood for change,

07:24.044 --> 07:26.980
um, do you want to talk
about your flannel shirts?

07:30.551 --> 07:32.252
What's wrong
with my flannels?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.187
That's my look.
People love it.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.857
And I love it. Yeah.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.927
I mean, they're practical.
Uh-huh.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.029
'Cause you never know
when you might be on a river

07:42.062 --> 07:44.865
spinning a log under your feet.

07:44.898 --> 07:48.669
And when that happens,
I will be ready.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.042
Hey, hey, hey, uh,
uh, uh, hands off.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.645
Those are the name-brand snacks
we save for strangers.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.012
If you're hungry,
go to the pantry

07:59.046 --> 08:01.715
and get yourself some
Ding-Dangs or a Twonkie.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.717
Okay, kids,

08:03.751 --> 08:05.686
and stay away
from the door, all right?

08:05.719 --> 08:07.721
'Cause it's about to fly open,
and I don't want you

08:07.755 --> 08:09.156
to get trampled
by a mob of neighbors

08:09.189 --> 08:10.824
who can't wait to see us.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.027
Where's the mob
of neighbors?

08:14.061 --> 08:17.097
I haven't seen a car
drive by all day.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.899
Even the birds are gone.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.134
Did the rapture happen?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.272
Wasn't this party supposed
to start a half an hour ago?

08:25.305 --> 08:27.040
Oh, the guy
who takes 45-minute showers

08:27.074 --> 08:30.077
can suddenly tell time.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.946
Oh, all right,
there's Dirt Yard Bob.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.314
I'll go see
if he knows anything.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.216
Yo, Dirt Yard--

08:36.249 --> 08:38.919
Hey, Bob!

08:40.020 --> 08:42.289
So, where are we
on snacks?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.892
I'd like to eat some of that
guacamole before it goes bad.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.327
: Like this party.
Am I right, guys?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.998
Yeah, that's funny.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.966
Yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.703
I'm gonna remember that when
you're 16, and you want a car.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.340
Hey, come on,
we've had our fun. Let's go.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.144
Let's go clean our rooms because
we have the best parents ever.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.780
I like it. I don't believe it,
but I like it.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.686
Dirt Yard says that
the new neighbors took everyone

09:12.720 --> 09:14.087
to the Steelers Stadium.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.322
Yeah. The husband works there,

09:15.355 --> 09:16.957
and he's giving a tour
of the locker room.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.093
So they stole
our party guests?

09:20.127 --> 09:22.162
We can't compete
with the Steelers.
Ugh.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.064
Our party doesn't even
have a theme.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.133
Uh, guacamole
and pizza bites?

09:26.166 --> 09:29.970
Who are we?
What's our message?

09:30.003 --> 09:32.172
Let's think
about this.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.049
Okay, well, we already
ticked off the old neighbors.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.884
Oh, you don't
know the half of it.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.987
But the new neighbors
don't know us well enough

09:47.020 --> 09:49.657
not to like us, right?

09:49.690 --> 09:51.291
So we make nice
with them, and then,

09:51.324 --> 09:54.061
we can worm our way back
into the community from there.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.829
Yeah, we can do that.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.799
We've wormed our way
into plenty of stuff.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.333
Yeah, so when the new
neighbors get home,

10:00.367 --> 10:02.002
we'll go over there,
and we'll make nice.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.871
Good plan.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.173
Okay, now, is there any way
I could dress you for this?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.975
Hey, we agreed a long time ago.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.376
You're not allowed to dress me.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.748
What if I promise to
undress you first?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.185
Oh, that's a dirty trick.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.687
All right,
I'll meet you upstairs.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.724
Bring the guacamole.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.198
I hate this shirt.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.000
I think you look handsome.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.703
I look like you dressed me
at babyGap.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.871
Okay, now, remember,
we have to be friendly.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.907
All right?
Especially to the wife.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.709
Don't worry. Wives love me.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.877
We'll be pals
inside of 20 minutes.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.348
Hiya.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.250
Hello.

10:50.283 --> 10:53.721
This might take longer
than 20 minutes.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.361
Step away from my welcome mat.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.430
It does not apply to you.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.366
So, I guess

11:06.399 --> 11:08.702
the new neighbors do know us
well enough not to like us.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.704
You know that really nice

11:10.738 --> 11:12.205
county inspector
I was telling you about?

11:12.239 --> 11:13.974
Well, Joy here replaced him.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.277
I guess in your private life
you dress like Blue's Clues.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.480
And now we're neighbors.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.751
"Neighbors"? I paid $400
for a home inspector.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.319
He said we were pest-free.

11:26.353 --> 11:30.223
Inspectors, huh?
They're the worst.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.993
I am closing my door now.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.229
Now, she is unfriendly.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.465
She was the one person
we had to make friends with,

11:38.498 --> 11:39.733
and you've already
ticked her off.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.968
Hey, we're not out of this.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.469
She got a husband, right?
Some poor guy

11:42.502 --> 11:45.238
was tricked into marrying her.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.440
Husbands love me.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.977
Five minutes ago,
wives loved you.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.912
I'm telling you,
I'm great with guys.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.214
If you let me put my flannel on,
I can save this.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.248
I'm all Clark Kent now.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.817
Let me be Superman.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.319
No, no. Not Superman.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.022
Flannel-Man.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.292
You're gonna want me

12:05.325 --> 12:07.961
to call you that now,
aren't you?

12:07.995 --> 12:09.830
I don't need you to. No.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.231
Flannel-Man knows who he is.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.504
Hey, honey.
How's it going?

12:17.537 --> 12:19.239
Hey. Great. Yeah.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.074
I invited Joy's husband over
for a beer.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.043
I left a note on his truck.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.312
Isn't that kind of stalkery?

12:25.345 --> 12:26.013
No, no.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.048
That's how flannel guys text.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.517
And his name's Rudy.
I found that out

12:30.550 --> 12:32.152
when I went through his mail.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.089
Oh! That's him.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.358
Okay. Save the day, Flannel-Man.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.398
Rudy. Hey.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.400
: Nice shirt,
huh? Look at that.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.870
Huh?
Yeah. Just so you know,

12:49.903 --> 12:52.005
I'm very sorry
for what's about to happen.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.306
Oh, why?
What

12:53.340 --> 12:54.774
Listen up, man!

12:55.876 --> 12:59.079
My wife is watching
from across the street!

13:00.147 --> 13:01.514
She wanted me
to come over here

13:01.548 --> 13:03.016
and yell at you!

13:03.050 --> 13:06.153
She really likes it
when I do this!

13:07.387 --> 13:11.158
So I need to have a fake fight
with you right now,

13:11.191 --> 13:13.961
or I'm gonna have a real one
when I get home!

13:16.329 --> 13:18.431
Okay, I-I was just hoping

13:18.465 --> 13:20.200
we could talk this out
man-to-man.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.369
What you need to understand

13:22.402 --> 13:26.373
is I can't help you

13:26.406 --> 13:29.009
'cause I can't help myself!

13:30.543 --> 13:32.512
Maybe when all of this
blows over,

13:32.545 --> 13:34.381
we can get that beer!

13:44.624 --> 13:48.028
Are you sure you want
to be friends with them?

13:48.061 --> 13:49.596
I bet there's somebody out there
looking for them

13:49.629 --> 13:52.199
with a big butterfly net.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.334
Honey, I want to be part
of the community.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.603
I want to know our neighbors.
It's nice.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.405
Look, I want you
to have all that,

13:58.438 --> 14:00.307
but I don't know
what else to do.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.374
You know what

14:01.408 --> 14:03.376
Honey, you tried, okay?

14:03.410 --> 14:04.344
And that's what's important.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.147
And that's why I love you.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.619
Well, that makes me
want to try even more.

14:12.652 --> 14:16.523
Would it help
if I undressed you again?

14:18.425 --> 14:20.460
Come on.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.064
LOWELL:
Okay.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.899
Joy's out there
checking the slab.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.400
And yelling at Big Ernie.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.403
Boy, she's a real multitasker.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.072
Okay, great.
When she comes in here,

14:32.105 --> 14:33.406
remember our plan.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.010
What was it again?
Lowell forgot.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.478
You two pick a fight with Joy,

14:38.511 --> 14:39.980
and I'll defend her
by yelling at you.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.448
According to her husband,
she loves that,

14:41.481 --> 14:44.017
so she'll love me,
and our problems will be solved.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.518
But then she'll be mad at us.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.520
Yeah, but that's
your problem. Okay?

14:47.554 --> 14:51.191
You guys can come up
with your own plan to fix that.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.260
Ooh, here she comes.
Showtime.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.228
Places, everybody.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.498
Joy!

14:58.531 --> 14:59.933
What a surprise.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.668
Mr. Burns, I got your message,

15:01.701 --> 15:03.336
and I've rechecked
the concrete.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.938
I'm a professional.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.940
I put my personal feelings
aside.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.043
So, you'll be thrilled to know
it's still not ready.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.346
No!

15:13.380 --> 15:15.248
I will not watch this she-devil

15:15.282 --> 15:18.218
tear down everything we
worked so hard to build.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.088
Me, neither, Don.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.224
You're a mean, mean lady.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.692
All right, that's enough.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.527
I'm not gonna let you two
talk to Joy like that.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.529
Okay, we need more
people like her

15:29.562 --> 15:32.199
who follow the rules
and try to do the right thing.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.701
Mr. Burns...

15:34.734 --> 15:36.669
And I'll tell you
something else.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.572
As a woman,
she has to work twice as hard

15:39.606 --> 15:41.141
to get half as far.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.278
All while maintaining
perfect hair.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.414
It really is fantastic.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.583
I was wrong before.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.452
Joy is her name

15:52.485 --> 15:54.554
because that's who she is

15:54.587 --> 15:56.589
and that's what she spreads.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.459
Did you really think

15:59.492 --> 16:01.561
I was gonna fall for
your little show?

16:01.594 --> 16:03.363
I mean, the big one was good,

16:03.396 --> 16:05.132
but the little one was shaky.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.601
I didn't connect
with the material.
Okay.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.137
You know what?
It was a Hail Mary.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.571
I'm desperate here.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.706
Okay, my wife really wants
to be friends with you,

16:13.740 --> 16:16.476
and I really need you
to sign off on that slab,

16:16.509 --> 16:19.346
and none of that is happening
because you don't like me.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.413
Okay, so,

16:20.447 --> 16:21.548
I need to get on your good side.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.549
What do I do?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.451
Tell you what.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.154
You pick one.
I'll sign off on the slab,

16:27.187 --> 16:29.256
or I'll be friends
with your wife.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.594
Pick the slab.

16:36.063 --> 16:39.299
Pick the slab.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.801
No. You know what?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.436
If I have to choose,

16:43.470 --> 16:45.538
I'm gonna go with Andi.

16:45.572 --> 16:46.806
I respect that.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.542
Maybe I misjudged you.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.810
And you picked
the right one,

16:50.843 --> 16:53.213
because I am not signing
off on that wet slab.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.548
You're a mean, mean lady.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.084
Lowell, Lowell. Whoa. Hey, hey.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.518
It's over.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.053
I can't turn it off.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.726
Hey. Great news, babe.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.528
I picked up
something for dinner:

17:08.561 --> 17:09.629
our new neighbors.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.634
Aw, Flannel-Man.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.669
Hi.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.638
I'm Andi. And together,

17:18.671 --> 17:21.674
we are going to dominate
this cul-de-sac.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.311
I like you already.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.781
So, Janet had a thing
with Dirt Yard Bob?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.650
Yeah.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.586
He had grass back then.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.688
He seduced her with his piano.

17:37.690 --> 17:41.161
I'm sorry my husband came
down on you so hard.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.629
Yeah, but you watch your step,

17:42.662 --> 17:45.232
or we'll go outside
and settle this like men.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.705
Hey, uh, honey, you know
what I was thinking?

17:52.739 --> 17:55.475
Huh?
We should host a potluck
with these guys.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.643
You know, have all the
neighbors over here.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.311
That's a great idea.

17:58.345 --> 18:01.214
I already have a pineapple swan.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.483
Well, the kids ate the neck,

18:03.516 --> 18:06.119
so now it's more of
a pineapple duck.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.556
Sorry, we're not speaking
to any of the neighbors.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.091
They're all a bunch of mooches.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.698
You know what, Joy?
You're right.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.300
They are mooches.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.136
What? When I said that,

18:23.170 --> 18:24.871
you said I was unfriendly.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.606
Well, yes, but now

18:26.639 --> 18:28.241
I'm hearing it
from the community.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.477
See?

18:30.510 --> 18:32.812
Okay, we
should get home.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.315
Rudy and I have tai chi
in the morning.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.284
Yeah, that's what keeps her
so mellow.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.688
You know,
we should do this again.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.523
You'll find

18:43.556 --> 18:46.293
I'm a lot looser once I take off
my inspector's badge.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.161
Hey, you know,
speaking of inspections,

18:48.195 --> 18:49.829
what do you say we celebrate
everyone getting along

18:49.862 --> 18:53.166
by signing off
on that slab, huh?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.934
Well, I guess
since we're friends now,

18:54.967 --> 18:57.670
I'll sign off on it
when I'm good and ready.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.439
But...

18:59.472 --> 19:00.773
What happened?

19:00.807 --> 19:01.908
You heard the lady!

19:01.941 --> 19:04.477
She said
when she's good and ready!

19:05.912 --> 19:07.747
:
I can't help you.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.819
Look at us.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.887
We got new friends for me.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.224
And they hate
everybody else for me.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.633
Okay.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.301
All right.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.469
Since you're joining
the softball team,

19:29.502 --> 19:31.871
here's your jersey.
Oh.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.514
You named our softball team
the Master Batters?

19:41.548 --> 19:43.850
Yes, I did.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.619
I'm not wearing that.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.655
Well, what's wrong?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.523
It's not tough enough?

19:50.557 --> 19:53.192
How about
the Furious Master Batters?

19:55.027 --> 19:57.730
Adding words isn't gonna help.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.899
I don't see a problem.
Look, we're called that

19:59.932 --> 20:01.501
because we're so good
at getting hits.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.571
I want everyone to know
I'm a master batter.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.675
Oh.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.644
Okay, Lowell,
say it in your head,

20:11.678 --> 20:14.547
and remember Don is the one
who came up with it.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.218
Don!

20:20.920 --> 20:28.628
I wore this to church.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.663
