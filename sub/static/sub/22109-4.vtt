WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.006
(thunder rumbling)

00:11.245 --> 00:12.813
I'm scared, Mom.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.082
What if they take me?

00:14.115 --> 00:16.016
Don't worry, Barterfinger.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.052
You're always the last.

00:18.086 --> 00:21.489
Even boxes of stale raisins
go before you, Butterfinger--

00:21.522 --> 00:23.191
I mean, Barterfinger.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.558
(gasps)

00:24.592 --> 00:26.260
No one ever wants the apple.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.929
They must be afraid
there's a razor blade in me.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.432
Yeah. That's the reason.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.934
Maybe you'll be
dipped in caramel.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.104
Oh, whoop-dee-doo.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.071
(all gasping)

00:37.105 --> 00:38.906
What the... Where am I going?

00:38.939 --> 00:41.075
You're going to heaven, Dad.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.577
GRAMPA: Those pearly gates
look a lot like teeth!

00:43.611 --> 00:45.246
Change is always hard.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.947
Well, I guess that...

00:46.980 --> 00:49.217
(Grampa screaming)

00:49.250 --> 00:51.252
Cigarette breath!

00:55.089 --> 00:56.290
Oh, thank God.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.159
We made it through the night.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.364
And now you're on a high shelf,

01:03.397 --> 01:07.135
where they'll forget
about you forever!

01:07.168 --> 01:10.371
(crying):
Why won't the earth take me?

01:10.404 --> 01:13.441
I hear you, my friend.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.076
Mmm, candy.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.745
Homer, no!

01:17.778 --> 01:19.147
Don't be silly, honey.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.714
Chocolate doesn't feel anything.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.550
No! God, no!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.084
Dad...!

01:24.118 --> 01:26.487
I can't listen to this horror!

01:26.520 --> 01:27.921
Okay, I'm on it.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.157
(screams stops abruptly)

01:29.190 --> 01:30.358
Thank you.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.194
(chewing noisily)

01:37.198 --> 01:39.200
*

01:46.440 --> 01:48.442
(The Exorcist
theme music playing)

01:56.016 --> 01:58.118
(thunder crashes)

01:58.152 --> 01:59.987
*

02:09.463 --> 02:12.666
It's here!
Maggie's first Pazuzu!

02:12.700 --> 02:14.468
Your father
ordered this because...

02:14.502 --> 02:16.337
Mm, why did you order this?

02:16.370 --> 02:18.138
I thought it was pizza.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.040
Yeah, I'll send it back
tomorrow.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.176
Tonight we have
a cocktail party.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.977
And we came early.

02:24.011 --> 02:27.281
And I left my face
on your hand towel.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.916
(Marge grumbles)

02:29.883 --> 02:30.851
Hmm.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.253
(humming a melody)

02:34.188 --> 02:36.123
(groans)

02:36.156 --> 02:37.625
Don't worry, Maggie.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.027
While Mommy and Daddy
carouse downstairs,

02:40.060 --> 02:42.129
you'll be here
in the dark with Pazuzu!

02:42.162 --> 02:45.233
(to "When Irish Eyes Are
Smiling): * When Pazuzu's eyes

02:45.266 --> 02:46.834
* Are glaring

02:46.867 --> 02:50.538
* It's time to go to bed

02:50.571 --> 02:53.807
* You'll see
demon shadows fighting *

02:53.841 --> 02:57.545
* But it's just
inside your head *

02:57.578 --> 03:01.582
* When Pazuzu's eyes
are staring *

03:01.615 --> 03:04.985
* The moonlight will turn red

03:05.018 --> 03:10.190
* 'Cause Pazuzu's
in your nightmares *

03:10.224 --> 03:13.160
* Until we all

03:13.193 --> 03:16.029
* Are dead.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.531
Sweet dreams, Maggie.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.667
Don't let the Beelzebubs bite.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.068
(door creaks)

03:21.101 --> 03:23.404
*

03:23.437 --> 03:26.039
-(piano playing)
-(lively chatter)

03:26.073 --> 03:27.941
Nobody's eating my chowder.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.444
Maybe I can take it
back home with me.

03:35.115 --> 03:39.019
Maggie, sweetie,
you should be in bed.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.789
(demonic voice):
No one leaves alive.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.191
Ooh, her first words!

03:44.224 --> 03:45.726
Did someone get that
on their phone?

03:45.759 --> 03:47.928
LENNY:
Aw, she's got red eye.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.897
She's a demon from hell!

03:49.930 --> 03:51.732
Also, generic cola?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.100
Really? (chuckles)

03:53.133 --> 03:54.735
Cocktail fail.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.069
(groans)

03:56.103 --> 03:57.037
Thank you.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.238
(all screaming)

04:03.577 --> 04:04.812
(cell door slams)

04:04.845 --> 04:07.114
Well, at least
we still got the liquor.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.017
(whines, grunts)

04:10.951 --> 04:12.820
(gurgles)

04:12.853 --> 04:14.322
Ah, my chowder!

04:14.355 --> 04:16.424
Someone's starting
the terrible twos.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.991
(chuckles)

04:18.025 --> 04:20.528
(demonic voice): Someone's
having an affair with his nurse.

04:21.829 --> 04:25.132
-Say "ah."
-A... dulterer.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.134
179? I...

04:27.167 --> 04:28.135
(grunts)

04:28.168 --> 04:30.571
(choking laugh)

04:30.604 --> 04:34.007
I'm afraid that little devil
needs an exorcism.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.110
I'm afraid they didn't
teach me those at Pepperdine.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.512
*

04:38.546 --> 04:41.114
Bible ribbons, that'll hold her.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.985
-(groans)
-(toy siren wailing)

04:45.018 --> 04:47.521
Oh, good, the police are here.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.156
(chokes)

04:49.189 --> 04:50.824
(owl hoots)

04:51.892 --> 04:54.428
When is that exorcist
gonna get here?

04:54.462 --> 04:55.996
Marge, we'll be fine.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.131
Maggie just learned
what a circle is.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.603
HOMER: Okay, whoever she stops
at has to change her diaper,

05:02.636 --> 05:05.005
which appears to contain
flaming lava.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.541
MARGE: Oh, you just never
want to change a diaper.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.976
(Homer whimpers)

05:09.009 --> 05:10.511
I'll handle this.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.449
-(gasps)
-(shouting gibberish)

05:15.483 --> 05:17.985
(muffled gibberish)

05:18.018 --> 05:20.020
(losing breath)

05:23.056 --> 05:24.825
Oops. Sorry about that.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.494
First thing,
we'll see just how powerful

05:26.527 --> 05:28.896
our demon here truly is.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.731
The chicken goes...

05:30.764 --> 05:33.333
(demonic roaring)

05:34.668 --> 05:36.169
Well, there's only
one answer here:

05:36.203 --> 05:38.839
-cut her loose!
-Are you sure?

05:38.872 --> 05:41.074
If you can't trust
a Catholic priest with a child,

05:41.108 --> 05:42.175
who can you trust?

05:42.209 --> 05:43.110
(Marge groans)

05:45.913 --> 05:47.915
*

05:51.084 --> 05:54.988
By the power of Christ,
I say devil be out!

05:55.022 --> 05:56.557
That's all you've got?

05:56.590 --> 05:58.158
Well, I say it three times.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.527
This guy's good.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.028
Devil be out!

06:01.061 --> 06:06.500
I am Pazuzu,
demon of the southwest wind.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.937
Wait, wait, so you're not even
as powerful as the south wind

06:09.970 --> 06:11.271
or the west wind?

06:11.304 --> 06:13.006
How lame is that?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.374
I used to be very important.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.709
Google it.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.511
-Devil be out!
-(thunder crashes)

06:17.545 --> 06:20.113
Google it!

06:22.315 --> 06:24.317
*

06:26.119 --> 06:27.955
Your baby is saved.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.023
Fantastic.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.292
She's not going to be
a religious weirdo, is she?

06:32.325 --> 06:34.127
-No.
-Fantastic.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.429
Now hush.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.631
Pazuzu is still among us.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.066
But where?

06:39.099 --> 06:42.235
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

06:42.269 --> 06:43.604
(gasps) Bart?

06:43.637 --> 06:45.372
(demonic voice):
Let me out, let me out!

06:45.405 --> 06:48.041
This boy has the darkest soul
I've ever seen.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.144
It's worse than working
for David Schwimmer!

06:51.178 --> 06:54.247
Yo, Pazuzu, grow me some horns.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.483
(Homer chuckles)

06:55.516 --> 06:58.418
Those aren't horns,
those are nubs. (laughs)

06:59.352 --> 07:00.954
No, no, no!

07:00.988 --> 07:03.824
(nasally): Well, at least
it'll get me out of jury duty.

07:03.857 --> 07:04.858
D'oh!

07:08.295 --> 07:10.564
*

07:10.598 --> 07:13.967
* Lisa, Lisa
wants a better life *

07:14.001 --> 07:17.905
* Lisa, Lisa,
go under the knife *

07:17.938 --> 07:21.942
* Homer, Homer
got a button wife. *

07:21.975 --> 07:26.980
So, anyone want to pick up
litter at the park today?

07:27.014 --> 07:28.148
How about you, Maggie?

07:28.181 --> 07:30.350
She's still got
a touch of Pazuzu.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.085
At least she never threw up.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.121
(demonic retching)

07:40.293 --> 07:41.862
That's just great.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.031
Everywhere but the sink.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.835
(groans) Sometimes I think
I was born in the wrong family.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.770
(cat meowing)

07:49.803 --> 07:51.338
Oh? Hey, Mr. Cat.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.340
What are you playing with?

07:53.373 --> 07:55.042
A secret door?

07:55.075 --> 07:58.111
We don't have smoke alarms,
but we have this?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.881
HOMER (in distance):
Smoke is its own alarm.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.050
No, no, Snowball, come back!

08:03.083 --> 08:05.085
It's too dangerous!

08:08.321 --> 08:12.325
Sometimes tiny doors
lead to big opportunities.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.395
-(gasps) You could talk?
-Indeed.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.131
For centuries, the cat has been
the symbol of intelligence,

08:18.165 --> 08:20.067
the otherworld savoir faire--

08:20.100 --> 08:21.535
Ooh, shiny!

08:21.569 --> 08:23.537
Oh, there it is. Where'd it go?

08:23.571 --> 08:25.238
There it is. Where'd it go?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.174
There it is.
Where'd it go?

08:27.207 --> 08:28.341
(clears throat) Enough.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.544
Let's go meet your other family.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.980
(gasps) Other family?

08:33.013 --> 08:36.884
Already the talking cat isn't
the most interesting thing.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.919
-(door creaks)
-(Lisa gasps)

08:42.455 --> 08:46.760
Whoa! For a Halloween show
middle segment, this is amazing.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.796
-(Homer humming a melody)
-(Bart chewing noisily)

08:50.764 --> 08:54.467
Every girl's dream,
a perfect family.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.838
(screams)

08:57.871 --> 08:59.940
Good morning, sleepyhead.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.275
For breakfast, tofu or kale?

09:02.309 --> 09:04.077
Oh, that's nice.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.179
But what's with the button eyes?

09:06.213 --> 09:08.548
We don't all have
button eyes, silly.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.183
Some have button mouths.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.185
(muffled):
What's up?!

09:12.219 --> 09:15.355
Lisa, would you like
to jam with us?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.957
You like jazz?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.632
(lively jazz music playing)

09:29.502 --> 09:32.806
You're all good,
but not better than me.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.142
I wish I could stay forever.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.977
Oh, but you can.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.279
All right. Let me guess.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.415
Do you have to sew buttons
over my eyes?

09:42.449 --> 09:43.984
Don't worry, sugar plum,

09:44.017 --> 09:46.053
we'll give you
a button to bite on

09:46.086 --> 09:47.554
while we sew 'em on.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.957
-(screams)
-Hold steady.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.126
(panting)

09:53.160 --> 09:55.128
Oh, sweetie,
you're just in time.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.130
I killed a snake
with your saxophone and--

09:57.164 --> 09:58.298
Can you blow its head out?

09:58.331 --> 10:00.901
Here, let me just wipe the blood
off the mouthpiece.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.636
Buttons, please.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.108
Hmm, something's missing.

10:08.141 --> 10:11.578
Didn't we have a kid
between Bart and the baby?

10:11.611 --> 10:14.514
Little smarty pants,
plays the flute, I think.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.950
Lisa. She's been gone for days.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.919
And the police
have been no help.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.855
That's not true. I helped you
reassemble that high chair.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.958
Damn it!

10:24.992 --> 10:26.994
(Wiggum grunting)

10:29.029 --> 10:31.965
Well, we got two kids now,
so no favoritism.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.802
Maggie will get Lisa's room,
Maggie will get Lisa's clothes,

10:34.835 --> 10:36.203
Bart will get Lisa's homework.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.139
Cowabunga!

10:39.172 --> 10:40.340
(Marge humming)

10:40.373 --> 10:42.509
(gasps)
Bart! How'd you find me?

10:42.542 --> 10:44.111
I had an informant.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.013
I know, he can talk.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.148
He can? I just followed him in.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.218
Oh, God. Now I'll
have to talk to him.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.521
Uh, I don't think
he's coming back.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.323
How can you be so calm?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.458
I bore both those children.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.194
Hey, your stories aren't great,
but I wouldn't call them boring.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.629
(groans):
Oh.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.664
I'm going in there now.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.003
You really did it
this time, Homer.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.839
You lost your family.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.974
Wait, you can speak
on this side?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.843
Yes, I just don't like to.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.477
Makes the dog feel inferior.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.812
(whining bark)

11:18.846 --> 11:19.813
All right.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.414
(grunting)

11:21.448 --> 11:22.916
Oh! So tight.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.986
Why did I eat
that second lunch at lunch?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.821
Someone kick me in the ass!

11:27.855 --> 11:29.289
(grunts) Thank you!

11:31.792 --> 11:34.394
What is it about this world
that's so great?

11:34.427 --> 11:37.197
The Homer in this world
doesn't pass gas.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.900
That was a three-button job.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.935
Would you like to have two eyes?

11:41.969 --> 11:44.772
We can talk to each other
while you watch TV.

11:44.805 --> 11:48.108
Just what Homer needs,
an excuse to get lazier.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.442
Why, you little...

11:49.476 --> 11:53.713
I'll lazy you,
you otherworldly...

11:53.747 --> 11:55.883
-What the...
-That was my Bart!

11:55.916 --> 11:59.052
Boy, sure is hard to see
with buttons on your eyes.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.054
D'oh!

12:01.088 --> 12:03.090
(gasps)
You killed my husband!

12:05.759 --> 12:08.628
HOMER: Spider wife, dead son,
two girls with button eyes?

12:08.661 --> 12:11.664
I think this marriage has
finally gotten out of its rut.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.301
(vacuum whirring)

12:14.334 --> 12:17.270
Yep, I got everything
just the way I want it,

12:17.304 --> 12:20.440
including an extra me to go
to parent-teacher conferences.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.710
Oh! Bart drew this picture
of his family.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.946
Now we're getting visits
from a social worker

12:25.979 --> 12:27.380
and an exterminator.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.982
I'll be ready.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.283
-(gunshot)
-(chain saw buzzes)

12:30.317 --> 12:33.086
And I've learned,
no matter how bad things are,

12:33.120 --> 12:35.989
they can get much, much worse.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.058
(muffled):
Huh, you're telling me.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.993
Haw... haw.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.564
(instruments warming up)

12:44.597 --> 12:46.133
-(clears throat)
-(instruments stop)

12:46.166 --> 12:48.435
No one will be seated
during the third act

12:48.468 --> 12:50.070
of this Halloween show.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.140
What you're about to see
is so disgusting

12:53.173 --> 12:56.076
you'll watch Game of Thrones
to calm down.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.978
You have been warned.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.013
*

13:10.690 --> 13:13.760
Man, am I jealous of you guys.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.796
Two weeks in Lima, Ohio,
with Patty and Selma

13:16.830 --> 13:18.866
while I'm stuck here working.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.768
It's gonna be lonely.
So lonely.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.871
Well, if you really
want us to stay...

13:23.904 --> 13:26.039
We've already kissed good-bye
and the car heard it!

13:27.240 --> 13:30.010
(tires screeching)

13:30.043 --> 13:32.545
They're gone.
Not a second to waste.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.581
(laughing)

13:37.684 --> 13:39.786
(to "On the Road Again"):
* Left alone again

13:39.819 --> 13:42.789
* Yes, I'm eating
provolone again *

13:42.822 --> 13:46.726
* Food just tastes better
in the bathroom now and then *

13:46.759 --> 13:50.998
* I just love being
left alone again *

13:51.031 --> 13:53.566
* Left alone for days

13:53.600 --> 13:57.204
* I ate two dozen bags
of Frito-Lays *

13:57.237 --> 14:00.707
* I'm gonna brush my teeth
with mayonnaise *

14:00.740 --> 14:04.177
* Now my sweat tastes
just like doughnut glaze. *

14:05.512 --> 14:06.947
(shrieks)

14:08.048 --> 14:10.750
(shrieking)

14:12.886 --> 14:15.088
Not a single morsel
in the house!

14:15.122 --> 14:17.090
(gasps)

14:17.124 --> 14:18.225
A forgotten hot dog.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.028
Oh, you're shivering.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.930
I'll take care of that.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.100
(to "Happy Birthday"):
* Happy birthday to meat

14:27.134 --> 14:29.236
* I can't wait to eat.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.105
-Now to slit it down the middle.
-(dog barks)

14:32.139 --> 14:34.107
I'm not splitting it with you.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.943
I'm just teaching you
how it's done.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.077
(barks)

14:37.110 --> 14:38.912
(groans)

14:38.946 --> 14:40.480
Still frozen.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.551
(screams) My finger!

14:44.584 --> 14:46.219
My hot dog!

14:49.056 --> 14:50.890
(sizzling)

14:50.924 --> 14:52.459
My finger! My poor...

14:52.492 --> 14:53.893
(moaning)

14:53.927 --> 14:55.728
...delicious finger.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.564
(sniffs) Wait a minute.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.799
I can't eat my own finger.
It's unholy.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.234
Also, it's not quite done.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.404
But sometimes a man has to do
the unthinkable,

15:04.437 --> 15:07.907
like eat something medium-rare.

15:07.941 --> 15:08.908
Oh!

15:08.942 --> 15:10.410
(fireworks whistling, popping)

15:10.443 --> 15:12.579
-(to "Hallelujah Chorus")
-* Hey, you ate you

15:12.612 --> 15:14.314
* You tasted great, you

15:14.347 --> 15:16.583
* Hey, you ate you,
hey, you ate you *

15:16.616 --> 15:19.119
* You cooked and ate you.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.120
-(phone chimes)
-Hmm?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.454
Hmm.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.490
(hums softly)

15:26.626 --> 15:28.795
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.830
It makes complete sense.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.601
I eat more and exercise less
than the most succulent pig.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.069
Of course I'm delicious!

15:36.103 --> 15:39.973
But I must never
eat me again. Never!

15:40.007 --> 15:43.176
On the other hand
is my other finger.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.912
And one thing I love
is consistency.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.947
(humming "Hallelujah Chorus")

15:49.616 --> 15:51.151
Hey, there, Homer Aloner.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.121
In the absence of the missus,
you want something delicious?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.656
(sighs)

15:56.689 --> 15:59.292
Don't worry, I'll be back.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.999
(wheels squeaking)

16:06.033 --> 16:08.035
Oh. Ooh, yuck.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.869
Oh, disgusting.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.439
Homer Simpson,
you don't like steak anymore?

16:12.472 --> 16:15.808
Actually, I've become
a bit of a me-gan.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.545
Do you have any spaghetti
with my-balls? Uh, meatballs?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.480
"Me-gan? My-balls?"

16:20.513 --> 16:23.116
Are you eating forbidden fruit?

16:23.150 --> 16:24.984
Fruit? Ugh.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.057
Sorry, Flanders,

16:30.090 --> 16:33.460
but I've got more delicious meat
in my little finger

16:33.493 --> 16:35.862
than you have
on this whole picnic table.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.030
Speaking of which...

16:37.064 --> 16:40.567
("Bustin' Loose" by
ReBirth Brass Band playing)

16:42.402 --> 16:43.503
* Whoo

16:43.536 --> 16:45.072
*

17:00.620 --> 17:02.055
* Whoo.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.556
*

17:07.127 --> 17:10.063
I have really gone
to a lot of trouble

17:10.097 --> 17:11.764
not to leave the house.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.500
MARGE (in distance):
Homie, we're home!

17:13.533 --> 17:14.501
(shrieks)

17:14.534 --> 17:17.070
What's with the gloves?

17:17.104 --> 17:20.173
Uh, I was watching
Breakfast at Tiffany's,

17:20.207 --> 17:22.509
and I thought I could be
more elegant.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.911
Elegant? With your waistline?

17:24.944 --> 17:26.746
I don't think so.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.683
Actually, Homer, you look like
you've lost 20 pounds.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.685
Well, I have been cutting back.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.687
That means something different
to me than you.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.089
What's wrong with your leg?

17:36.123 --> 17:38.225
Nothing. It was perfect.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.892
(Marge grumbles)

17:41.060 --> 17:43.096
(whirring in distance)

17:43.130 --> 17:46.099
(groaning)

17:46.133 --> 17:49.936
Homie, you shouldn't be snacking
in the middle of the night.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.104
It can't be good for your...

17:51.138 --> 17:52.972
(Marge screams)

17:56.676 --> 17:59.045
This is, without question,

17:59.078 --> 18:02.382
the worst moment
of our entire marriage.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.883
-What about...
-This is worse.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.385
Opa!

18:05.418 --> 18:08.087
HOMER: Marge, I admit it,
this is a rough patch.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.556
But I know when to stop.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.958
And when would that be?
When you're just a mouth?

18:11.991 --> 18:14.394
You see how she is, Doc?
Always negative.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.962
She makes me feel like nothing.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.131
You a almost nothing!

18:18.165 --> 18:19.832
Almost nothing.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.569
Homer, have you considered
your wife's feelings?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.771
Perhaps she takes
this new diet of yours

18:24.804 --> 18:26.406
as a comment on her cooking.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.774
Marge?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.076
I won't deny
that's a part of it.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.244
See? Progress.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.445
Now, excuse me.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.515
I need to go get famous
talking about you.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.984
Homie, I'm afraid this is it.

18:38.017 --> 18:41.988
Your self-destructive behavior
has gone too far.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.756
(muffled):
But, Marge...

18:43.790 --> 18:46.092
Good-bye, my love.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.195
(sobbing)

18:48.228 --> 18:51.030
Maybe, deep down,
that's why I ate myself--

18:51.063 --> 18:53.132
because I hate myself.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.035
MAN: Sounds like
someone had a breakthrough.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.638
Hi. I'm famous cooker-upper
Mario Batali.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.040
-You mean "chef"?
-I don't care for that term.

19:01.073 --> 19:04.043
Well, I know I don't belong
in therapy, but why are you?

19:04.076 --> 19:06.179
I got depressed
because I ran out

19:06.213 --> 19:08.014
of exciting new ingredients.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.617
Homer, we need to talk.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.452
Could we wok and talk?

19:12.485 --> 19:13.986
Well, sure.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.756
(sighs)

19:22.929 --> 19:26.132
HOMER: My dearest family,
I love you so much.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.068
And I think I've found a way
to earn your forgiveness.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.870
Please come home.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.872
Come home to flavor.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.650
He wanted me to pass on
these final words.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.984
"I've failed as a man,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.053
but I have succeeded
as an ingredient."

19:47.086 --> 19:48.221
I call the brain!

19:50.257 --> 19:51.691
(sighs):
Ah.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.660
He's gone.

19:53.693 --> 19:58.030
Well, I guess I can be proud
that he succeeded at something.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.066
Oh, it's a lot more
than something.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.869
Homer's the biggest thing
in food since free refills.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.103

* Hey, you ate you,
hey, you ate you *

20:10.377 --> 20:12.345
* You cooked and ate you.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.547
How did they get so much meat
out of Homer?

20:14.581 --> 20:17.784
Well, they mixed in some Barney,
Comic Book Guy and horse.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.085
Horse?!

20:20.653 --> 20:23.222
Do you know what it's like
to have everyone

20:23.256 --> 20:24.691
eat of your body?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.192
Yeah, like, every Sunday, pal.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.727
(munching)

20:27.760 --> 20:30.630
Uh, you know,
you don't get more of those.
