01:36.840 --> 01:41.289
Now, who do I have to skull-fuck
to get a drink in this town?

01:55.040 --> 01:57.725
I know, you're the Johnson Gang.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.722
He looks for guys like us.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.202
Thieves. Killers.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.600
Robbers.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.564
Get him whiskey.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.046
What's your name and where
you come from, anyhow?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.331
Ow.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.363
Name's Jeremiah.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.722
I was ridin' with the Hudson Gang,
out of Santa Fe.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.244
We'd just hit a bank and was
holed up outside of town.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.287
Then, he showed up.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.241
He came in outta nowhere,
like a phantom in the night.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.605
Had skin tough as buffalo leather.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.647
Eyes black as coal.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.001
A big ol' buffalo did his bidding,

03:03.120 --> 03:05.771
gorin' and stompin' two of the gang to death.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.449
He came in, both guns blazin',
like Billy the Kid.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.120
Ahh!

03:13.120 --> 03:18.001
Said he was shot stone-cold
dead by his brother Red.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.804
Right here in Tombstone.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.768
And then he came back from beyond
the grave to get his revenge.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.960
They say he did a deal with the Devil...

03:44.560 --> 03:49.441
Collecting souls from Oregon
all the way down to San Miguel.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.809
They say he's sent over 50 men down to hell.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.963
One man did all this?

04:00.480 --> 04:01.811
His name was...

04:02.480 --> 04:03.686
Guerrero.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.201
Who's next?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.007
Is he coming for me?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.647
Is he?

04:17.160 --> 04:19.161
Welcome to my hell.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.002
Who are you? Are you Guerrero?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.088
Join me for a drink, old buddy?

05:11.840 --> 05:13.569
You already killed me once.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.407
It's not like I can be dead again.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.121
What do you want?

05:18.360 --> 05:22.251
The man downstairs wants you
to pick up the pace.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.530
I can't do this forever. I'm done.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.450
You're never done, Guerrero.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.291
He owns you.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.969
Guess you can be dead again.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.965
This is hell!

06:12.320 --> 06:13.731
Liar!

06:19.680 --> 06:23.366
I'll deliver all souls
in exchange for my own soul.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.240
Their souls will feed
the fires of hell higher,

06:29.320 --> 06:31.561
and give you great pleasure right now.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.405
Well, look what the wind blew in.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.890
Long time no see, Sheriff.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.730
Yeah, not long enough.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.884
You here to turn yourself in?

07:57.400 --> 08:01.600
I'm here to pay my respects to my old
man and visit my family one last time.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.250
Then I'll be moving on.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.602
$5,000 bounty ain't nothin' to sneeze at.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.321
No. Nothin' to die for, either.

08:11.280 --> 08:15.365
You always were a scoundrel,
thief and a drunk old fool.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.808
At least we got one thing in common, Sheriff.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.961
Well, there was a band of Confederate
bad men, showed up here this morning.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.124
Pokin' around, askin' about you.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.367
They haven't pegged your family yet,
but you can bet they will.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.726
Then they'll die, Sheriff.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.923
I don't want my streets running red.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.765
I'm just passin' through.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.443
Let me give it to you with the bark on.

08:42.159 --> 08:44.320
Your mama's family in these parts,

08:44.400 --> 08:46.920
though she was nothin' but a saloon
whore when your papa died

08:47.000 --> 08:51.210
and she had to feed you and little Red,
but she finally found the Lord.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.324
She's made a good life for herself.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.201
Get to the point, Sheriff.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.600
This is a peaceful town.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.445
If you're lookin' for action,
move on to Dodge City or Tombstone.

09:02.040 --> 09:06.210
Pay your respects, put some steak
on the table, and get the hell out.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.564
Or I'll collect that bounty.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.446
I can live with that.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.200
Well...

09:16.800 --> 09:18.564
Here's to never seeing you again.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.560
Guerrero de la Cruz.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.520
Notorious bank robber.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.840
Cold-blooded assassin.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.524
I've been lookin' for you.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.040
- Have you now?
- Yes.

10:18.120 --> 10:23.400
I seem to find a trail of dead bodies
strewn across the country,

10:23.480 --> 10:25.050
and I keep missing you.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.331
Why don't you say your piece
before you lose another war.

10:31.960 --> 10:36.602
You sure do sound
just like your brother, Red.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.650
Oh, yes. I surprised you with that one.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.880
Red Cavanaugh and I used to ride together.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.282
We were highwaymen back
in Tennessee before the war.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.891
Jackson Boomer.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.966
In the flesh.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.246
What do you want with me?

10:55.880 --> 10:59.885
Well, Red bestowed a confidence in me.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.800
He told me that when he was a child,

11:02.880 --> 11:05.720
he had witnessed your mama

11:05.800 --> 11:10.283
putting a family heirloom
into a box made of bone.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.160
What?

11:12.240 --> 11:14.242
I will pay for that box.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.770
Or I will make you pay.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.920
Are you threatening me?

11:20.120 --> 11:21.281
Yes, sir.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.128
I am not a man accustomed to being gentle.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.047
If you don't turn over
that box, I will kill you.

11:29.640 --> 11:33.645
I will kill your family
and your family's family

11:34.000 --> 11:37.447
and the people you hate
and those who hate you!

11:38.440 --> 11:42.331
Well, Jackson Boomer,
you're shit out of luck,

11:42.920 --> 11:44.843
'cause I have no livin' family.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.006
Everybody that hates me is dead.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.010
And I've never heard of no bone box.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.170
And this being hallowed ground,

11:54.120 --> 11:55.610
I'm not gonna kill you.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
But you fuck with me again,

11:59.120 --> 12:02.966
and you'll end up just
like Red, in a pine box.

12:06.480 --> 12:11.008
Silver River sure does look
like a cozy place to stay.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.491
We'll be there for the next couple of days.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.486
You can let me know when you change
your mind about the box.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.926
Por ahÃ­ vamos.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.880
Hello, everyone.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.203
Here are your sausages and your stew. Enjoy.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.560
Hey, Bob.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.529
Shelby, can I get those beers up?

13:02.600 --> 13:03.965
All right, gentlemen.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.284
So, who's winning, Ray?

13:07.680 --> 13:10.411
Take it easy, Charley. He's just... Hey.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.801
Get outta here! Get outta here! Come on.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.840
You're gonna get some
fresh air, Charley. Come on.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.447
Get over here! Come on!

13:26.960 --> 13:28.200
Cool off, Charley.

13:28.680 --> 13:29.841
And go home.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.401
What'll it be?

13:52.360 --> 13:53.725
Act like you don't know me.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.726
I don't know you.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.088
It's me, your father.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.130
Oh, I know who you are.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.724
I'm just saying, I don't know you.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.886
Is there someplace
we can talk that's not here?

14:19.560 --> 14:21.130
There's an alley out back.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.125
Passin' through or here to stay?

14:32.760 --> 14:34.046
- Just passin' through.
- Hmm.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.210
Well, I hope you have an easy pass.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.725
That's an ugly habit.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.604
Now you wanna be my dad?

14:49.600 --> 14:50.601
Well, I don't need one,

14:51.320 --> 14:54.280
'cause I'm all grown up
and I can handle my own business.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.691
I saw that inside.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.560
Yeah.

14:57.640 --> 14:58.721
How's your grandma?

15:00.600 --> 15:01.647
Old.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.241
Mamacita.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.770
Don't you "Mamacita" me.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.730
You haven't visited in years.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.970
You trying to break my heart? Hmm?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.680
I got off trail.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.841
Off trail?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.163
You look like you been to hell and back.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.163
I see the "wanted" posters.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.002
You're still running from the law? Hmm?

15:29.280 --> 15:30.720
I got customers.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.441
If anybody asks if you know me, you don't.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.851
That won't be hard.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.003
Never thought I'd see you again.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.965
Hello, ladies.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.210
It's so nice to meet you.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.891
You're beautiful.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.449
Well, thank you kindly, ma'am.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.486
Ladies.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.481
Oh, my. Oh, my.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.611
Mmm. You are beautiful.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.725
I've got a naked girl...

16:58.160 --> 17:01.562
I need to know about
a special bone box, Mama.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.406
This is not a stick
that you want to pick up, son.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.651
You know where it is?

17:08.920 --> 17:10.285
It should never be found.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.119
Whoever possesses it

17:13.200 --> 17:17.171
holds the key to conjuring
immense evil power.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.400
Now Jackson wants it.

17:19.480 --> 17:20.810
He's threatened me

17:22.599 --> 17:23.964
and my whole family.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.847
Darkness always followed you, Guerrero.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.010
I'm an old woman, son.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.884
Not long for this world.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.527
So now is the time to tell you.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.363
But you must promise me one thing.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.321
Name it, Mama.

17:46.440 --> 17:51.241
You must pledge to protect
the contents at all costs.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.085
This has nothin' to do with me.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.166
Oh, but it does.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.400
Your father fought the Devil

18:00.480 --> 18:04.007
to make sure that this thing
didn't get into the wrong hands.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.203
You're a pawn in a bigger game.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.560
Lucifer chose you as a servant
to get back at your father,

18:12.640 --> 18:14.369
but you can change that.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.725
You must choose the path of redemption, mijo.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.726
I can't.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.771
I made a deal.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.964
The Devil owns me.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.120
I can change nothin', Mama.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.201
No.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.089
No, not true, mijo.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.691
You are the one who can.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.924
And you can't let Jackson Boomer win.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.040
Promise me.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.360
I can't.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.041
Then just leave.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.610
We don't need you here.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.560
Come on, boy. What's wrong, huh?

19:44.640 --> 19:46.165
What's wrong? What's the matter?

19:46.520 --> 19:48.284
Come on now. Cut it out.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.640
You tried to kill me.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.648
No, of course not. Just your horse.

21:05.320 --> 21:09.640
That's just the beginning of the many
ways in which I will hurt you

21:09.720 --> 21:11.210
to get what I want.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.280
And I want that box, Guerrero,

21:15.360 --> 21:17.120
and I want it now!

21:17.200 --> 21:19.601
Hey, hey, hey! Let's just calm down, fellers.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.486
Take it easy, partner.
Let's take this inside.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.931
Get inside. Get inside!

21:28.920 --> 21:30.126
Let's not.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.206
You sure you want this fight?

21:33.920 --> 21:35.285
I surely do not.

21:35.960 --> 21:40.608
But to get that book, if I have to,
I'll roll out the drums of war.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.930
Goddamn, Guerrero.

22:37.040 --> 22:41.360
I hate to break up this little party
you got goin' on out here,

22:41.440 --> 22:46.571
but you sure are a spectacle
to observe while you're in action.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.609
But my patience grows thin.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.364
Give me what I want now,

22:53.960 --> 22:58.284
or I will burn down this town
and everyone in it.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.970
I'll take you where the box is buried.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.527
No.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.326
Now we're talkin'.

23:13.640 --> 23:17.361
Cravens, take away his guns
and prepare to move out.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.642
You two, be safe.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.721
And bury my horse next to Papi's grave.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.201
Where is it?

24:05.600 --> 24:06.931
Buried right over there.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.808
We will have all of our guns trained on you.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.000
You pull any funny business,

24:15.080 --> 24:19.802
and we will fill you full of so much lead,
you will sink like a stone.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.045
Now, go dig up that box.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.402
Posthaste, Guerrero.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.611
Bring it over here.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.767
- Yeah.
- Got it! Yeah!

25:26.040 --> 25:28.168
Ho! Guerrero!

25:31.000 --> 25:32.081
You ain't gettin' away!

25:37.000 --> 25:38.240
Stop it!

25:40.040 --> 25:41.041
Cease fire!

25:42.600 --> 25:43.647
Hold it!

25:44.640 --> 25:47.291
What are you, crazy? Get over here.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.644
You said we'd fill him
full of lead if he tried to escape.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.767
I was bluffin' to keep him in line.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.691
Now, go get his body.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.601
He's dead, Colonel.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.080
Nobody could take that much lead and survive.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.970
Yeah. Well, I wanna see it for myself.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.409
Now, go find his body.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.840
That lyin' sack of shit!

26:52.920 --> 26:56.562
Now we're gonna have to find out
who knows where the real box is.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.561
I've seen you.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.966
Easy. Hey. Take it easy, son. Take it easy.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.686
Do you work for the Devil?

28:08.560 --> 28:10.608
You always assume people are bad?

28:12.160 --> 28:13.207
Aren't they?

28:15.120 --> 28:16.167
No.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.603
I'm a white hat kind of guy myself.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.044
I'm Dr. Goldsworthy.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.805
Are you a real doc...

28:36.480 --> 28:38.323
Son of a bitch.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.329
This Guerrero has a... A daughter, you say?

29:29.680 --> 29:31.011
Not bad to look at.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.681
But not a high-class lady.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.488
Not like the girls I employ here.

29:37.280 --> 29:38.725
Would you like a viewing?

29:39.040 --> 29:41.805
As is your custom, Madame Du Vere.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.250
Alicia is her name.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.843
Poor thing. She's rough around the edges.

29:51.960 --> 29:56.648
And she knows nothing
about fashion or perfumes.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.407
Or how to please a man.

30:02.960 --> 30:07.887
She serves greasy plates over at Pinky's
Saloon to the unwashed trash.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.251
My, you are a devil.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.365
Which body type do you prefer?

30:16.520 --> 30:17.726
Hourglass?

30:18.400 --> 30:19.447
Heart-shaped?

30:20.400 --> 30:21.606
Rotund?

30:22.240 --> 30:23.571
Oh!

30:25.200 --> 30:26.725
How about you?

30:27.600 --> 30:30.206
- Me?
- Yes, you.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.602
You prefer me to these younger girls?

30:32.920 --> 30:37.244
Well, you're like the diamond
to their silver settings.

30:46.160 --> 30:49.084
I'm top of the ticket, Mr. Boomer.

30:49.960 --> 30:53.760
The hours, they go fast,
and don't come cheap.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.886
Well, giddyap.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.126
Shall we continue this discussion
in my chamber room?

30:59.280 --> 31:00.964
Yes, ma'am.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.441
Gabriella?

31:03.720 --> 31:05.085
Give me some good news.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.521
He's alive.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.641
Are you sure?

31:10.120 --> 31:13.360
Yeah. It was a long way off,
but I saw him through my binoculars.

31:13.440 --> 31:16.205
A man drug him out of the river,
put him in a wagon.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.480
Where'd he take him?

31:18.880 --> 31:20.120
A house in town.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.048
A nice bath. It will help.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.521
Yeah.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.444
Dr. Goldsworthy.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.691
Didn't expect to see you here.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.969
I've been following your life
for a very long time now, Guerrero.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.530
You're a good man, despite yourself.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.280
I've done a lot of things
I'm not too proud of.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.521
No man's perfect.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.002
I believe every man deserves a second chance.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.927
I was born a sinner.
I'll probably die a sinner.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.487
You're more than just a sinner.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.081
You're a son,

35:38.120 --> 35:39.167
a father.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.727
You can find redemption.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.722
Think the Lord would be hard-pressed

35:49.280 --> 35:50.441
trying to forgive me.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.491
Yet here you are.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.881
So why not forgive yourself for your sins?

35:57.120 --> 35:58.770
There's more at stake than you realize.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.563
Stake? What's at stake?

36:02.440 --> 36:04.647
Your soul, for one.

36:06.640 --> 36:07.846
Your daughter.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.447
Alicia.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.241
She's the future.

36:13.560 --> 36:14.686
Your legacy.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.762
Where I go, Doc,

36:24.240 --> 36:25.446
Devil follows me.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.245
I don't see him here, do you?

36:29.600 --> 36:32.001
You can choose a righteous path.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.691
Now's your chance.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.970
I pulled you from that river
for one reason, son.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.964
To stop ridin' with the Devil
and get yourself right!

37:39.680 --> 37:40.760
Thank you.

37:40.840 --> 37:45.368
Thank you for your hospitality
this fine mornin'.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.842
This coffee's on the house, Mr. Boomer.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.720
And it's to go,

37:56.840 --> 37:58.569
because you're not wanted here.

37:59.680 --> 38:04.607
Is that so, Ms. Alicia de la Cruz?

38:07.040 --> 38:10.647
It seems the apple don't fall
too far from the tree.

38:10.880 --> 38:15.727
Although, you're a mite easier
on the eyes than your old man.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.686
What do you want?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.084
Mmm. Ah.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.725
Eggs, please.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.246
Sunny-side up.

38:31.840 --> 38:32.841
Bacon.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.606
Crispy.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.447
Ah, now, Mr. Cravens, manners.

38:41.080 --> 38:44.926
Jackson Boomer's out there
with his gang, wanting breakfast.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.161
He knows.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.406
Knows what?

38:51.920 --> 38:53.763
He knows Guerrero's my father.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.000
What'd he order?

38:57.080 --> 38:58.764
Eggs, sunny-side up.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.760
Let's give him what he ordered and then some.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.841
Hmm?

39:06.600 --> 39:07.761
What's that?

39:08.920 --> 39:10.046
Cyanide.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.127
Will it kill him?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.200
Kills the rats.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.611
He's a rat, right?

39:15.920 --> 39:17.445
What about me?

39:18.120 --> 39:19.360
She don't like you.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.125
Have a seat.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.326
Anything else?

39:32.320 --> 39:33.360
Your company.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.880
I have work to do.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.964
I am your work, Alicia.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.880
Now, please...

39:43.080 --> 39:44.127
Sit.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.765
What do you want with me?

39:54.720 --> 39:55.960
I don't even know my father.

39:56.720 --> 40:00.600
Shame on him for leaving
such a beautiful young thing

40:00.680 --> 40:02.762
to fend for herself.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.491
I'm doing okay.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.480
You'd be doin' a lot better

40:07.560 --> 40:11.007
if you worked down the street
for Madame Du Vere.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.968
I like to do my work standing up.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.811
Do you have any idea where your grandfather

40:23.000 --> 40:26.402
might have hidden a bone box?

40:27.840 --> 40:29.001
I've no clue.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.281
Bull Dog.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.046
You smell somethin'?

40:37.440 --> 40:38.601
You're gonna love this.

40:40.240 --> 40:44.040
We don't call him Bull Dog
on account of his pugilistic prowess.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.566
Stale beer.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.529
Sawdust.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.290
Cheap perfume.

40:54.560 --> 40:58.565
And whiskey breath on about
30 men on a refried bean diet.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.407
And?

41:07.040 --> 41:10.320
Somebody puked over in the corner.
It's about a week old.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.080
Somebody scrubbed it,

41:12.160 --> 41:15.160
but the odor lingers
a little bit too much for my taste.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.571
Impressive, huh?

41:17.400 --> 41:19.846
Yeah. Some parlor trick.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.440
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- Eh.

41:22.520 --> 41:26.002
No, I will not excuse you.

41:27.720 --> 41:28.926
Bull Dog.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.162
Are these eggs fresh?

41:35.720 --> 41:37.210
I wouldn't, boss.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.881
Fresh eggs have a particular aroma.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.770
Are these eggs fresh, Alicia?

41:53.520 --> 41:56.091
Got yourself a sickness there, Mr. Boomer?

41:56.200 --> 41:57.361
Diversion.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.206
Nice tactic.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.927
To answer your question, yes.

42:03.680 --> 42:07.960
This little mixture of morphine and alcohol
helps me get through the day.

42:08.040 --> 42:11.320
And I expect when this container
is empty and gone,

42:11.400 --> 42:13.209
I shall be gone with it.

42:13.600 --> 42:19.801
Hence, the urgency for finding
the location of the bone box.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.560
And this will magically
heal all that ails you?

42:25.640 --> 42:27.642
It will heal, yes.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.766
Now...

42:31.480 --> 42:32.720
Back to business.

42:36.720 --> 42:39.963
Are these eggs fresh?

43:12.120 --> 43:13.281
Fresh as a daisy.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.440
Goddamn, Guerrero!

43:15.520 --> 43:17.522
That is one hell of an entrance.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.010
And might I say, your timing is impeccable.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.160
Get the hell outta here, Alicia.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.288
Not so fast, young lady.

43:28.200 --> 43:29.690
Keep my family out of this.

43:30.160 --> 43:33.050
She's in the tall cotton now, Guerrero.

43:33.680 --> 43:38.880
And I have you to thank for
leadin' me to this shit-hole town

43:38.960 --> 43:41.884
so rich in family history.

43:42.960 --> 43:47.887
You know, the funny thing is,
your father stole this thing.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.321
It's not yours to protect or to own.

43:54.480 --> 43:57.165
My family and me got nothin' to do with it.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.645
Red was spinning you a tale.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.280
And if my father did steal something,

44:01.360 --> 44:03.362
he took that secret to the grave with him.

44:04.400 --> 44:07.520
Give me what I want, Guerrero,

44:07.600 --> 44:11.800
or I will fill the next coffin with
the carcass of your gorgeous daughter.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.803
Understand?

44:13.920 --> 44:15.126
I don't think so.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.480
Mama.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.560
Goddamn, Guerrero.
You got one hell of a family.

44:20.360 --> 44:24.570
You'd better let her go, or I'm going
to blow your brains out your ass.

44:24.960 --> 44:25.960
One.

44:26.040 --> 44:28.040
We don't have to go
and start killin' each other now.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.120
Two.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.560
I'd do what she says, Jackson.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.687
Mama don't play.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Three.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.120
Okay.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.440
Fine.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.081
You got me.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.446
Cover me. Cover me!

45:48.920 --> 45:50.365
Go. Cover me.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.281
Oh!

46:35.040 --> 46:38.249
Mamacita. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.362
Dr. Goldsworthy knows.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.602
Do the right thing, mijo.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.085
I'm counting on you.

47:02.840 --> 47:03.921
Oh, no.

47:04.520 --> 47:05.681
No!

47:06.240 --> 47:07.401
Don't leave me.

47:09.720 --> 47:10.881
No!

47:33.760 --> 47:36.889
Jackson, what are you trying to find?

47:37.520 --> 47:39.045
It's a goddamn book.

47:41.080 --> 47:42.730
Tell me more about this book.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.601
It is everything.

47:51.600 --> 47:54.649
It'll awaken me from this death spiral.

47:55.960 --> 48:01.126
I'll... I'll be able to control the world,
raise the dead.

48:01.600 --> 48:04.968
I will be able to exact my revenge.

48:05.160 --> 48:06.491
And you have no doubt?

48:07.200 --> 48:08.201
Oh.

48:08.360 --> 48:12.040
Long time ago, way down south in Mexico,

48:12.120 --> 48:14.168
there was a Day of the Dead like no other,

48:14.720 --> 48:19.282
and that was before this book
was secreted away.

48:21.120 --> 48:22.849
And if I find this book?

48:24.000 --> 48:25.161
Well...

48:26.080 --> 48:30.529
If you find this book,
then I will take you to hell and back.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.762
That sounds wonderful.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.451
You brought this evil here, Guerrero.

49:01.880 --> 49:03.530
I'm sorry, Alicia.

49:04.640 --> 49:05.801
Sorry?

49:06.880 --> 49:10.680
The road to hell is paved
with regret and reproach.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.640
But you know that.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.521
You've been traveling that road.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.010
You have to leave this town.

49:20.920 --> 49:22.365
And go where?

49:23.360 --> 49:25.647
This is my home.

49:27.560 --> 49:28.641
I...

49:28.960 --> 49:31.167
I can't have your blood on my hands.

49:31.800 --> 49:33.529
God damn you.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.686
God damn you, Guerrero.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.720
When your mother died,

49:43.800 --> 49:47.280
I was so full of anger
that I knew I had to leave

49:47.360 --> 49:51.410
or... or... Or ruin both of us, you and me.

49:54.480 --> 49:57.563
I'm so sorry, mi hijita.
Give me another chance.

49:58.280 --> 49:59.281
Give me...

49:59.480 --> 50:01.562
I can take care of myself.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.244
Maybe I need you.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.849
That's hard to imagine.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.723
So what's this all about, Doc?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.445
Follow me.

51:17.480 --> 51:18.527
Let's go.

51:18.760 --> 51:20.091
Now, watch yourself.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.444
Oh, my God.

51:34.640 --> 51:35.926
It's the bone box.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.286
Yeah.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.405
Whoa.

51:49.560 --> 51:50.686
Whoa.

51:52.760 --> 51:54.683
This is what everybody's dyin' over?

51:54.960 --> 51:57.320
It's called the Codex Dameonium.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.289
Latin for "the Devil's Book."

52:00.200 --> 52:04.000
It reveals the most powerful rituals
and practices for Devil worshippers.

52:04.520 --> 52:07.160
Now, if Jackson Boomer
were to possess this tome...

52:07.240 --> 52:10.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.
Some bad shit would happen.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.051
So why don't we just destroy it?

52:12.840 --> 52:15.286
Believe me, people have tried. I've tried.

52:16.320 --> 52:19.688
But just as the Devil himself
can't be completely eradicated,

52:20.400 --> 52:22.000
these pages are indestructible.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.889
Hmm. Oh, yeah?

52:34.080 --> 52:35.241
Nothin'.

52:35.880 --> 52:39.320
This book is a blueprint
on how to unleash hell on earth.

52:39.400 --> 52:40.845
How'd it end up here?

52:41.400 --> 52:43.767
Conquistadors brought it to the Americas.

52:44.560 --> 52:48.246
It was in Oaxaca with the church
officials for centuries.

52:48.920 --> 52:51.002
Then it fell into the wrong hands.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.965
Whoa!

53:26.120 --> 53:27.201
What's this?

53:27.480 --> 53:28.481
Soldiers.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.165
To add to our corps.

53:33.800 --> 53:34.961
Now...

53:37.480 --> 53:38.970
All we need is the book.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.007
Come on. Let's go, boys.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.481
Hyah!

54:07.000 --> 54:08.764
This sure looks like the hell I know.

54:09.320 --> 54:12.800
Well, now, we thought that this would be
a good place to keep it hidden, but now...

54:12.880 --> 54:17.162
It's only a matter of time before Jackson
finds this chamber and the book.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.480
We need to get it someplace safe.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.846
Back to Mexico.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.760
Back to Oaxaca, with the church officials.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.126
They'll know what to do with it.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.120
Ten feet away.

54:34.200 --> 54:35.486
She's dead.

54:44.800 --> 54:46.882
Kind people of Silver River,

54:47.200 --> 54:52.206
behold your possible future, should we
not acquire what it is we pursue.

54:53.880 --> 54:56.690
I sure hope you assist us in the matter.

54:57.760 --> 55:02.402
Let this be the final
declaration on the issue.

55:03.760 --> 55:06.001
Ladies and gentlemen, good day.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.160
This here's the package we discussed.

55:23.240 --> 55:24.360
You want it taken to Mexico?

55:24.440 --> 55:25.560
Yes, sir.

55:25.640 --> 55:27.210
Doesn't look like too much trouble.

55:28.600 --> 55:29.761
We'll do it.

55:30.360 --> 55:31.486
Good luck, son.

55:56.080 --> 55:58.080
Ha! Ha! Ho! Yah!

55:58.160 --> 56:00.128
Hey! Ho! Yah! Yah!

56:44.800 --> 56:46.484
Guerrero's daughter's leaving town.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.288
Stagecoach has the book, heading south.

56:54.280 --> 56:58.330
That coward's trying to keep
his daughter out of harm's way.

57:00.040 --> 57:03.920
Rouse the men and catch up with that coach.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.331
I want the book.

57:07.720 --> 57:08.846
Yes, Colonel.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.681
Boys, let's go.

57:17.520 --> 57:18.681
Stop right there!

57:39.760 --> 57:41.524
You wouldn't kill an unarmed man, would ya?

57:42.040 --> 57:43.201
Oh, I would.

58:07.600 --> 58:08.886
Yah!

59:54.560 --> 59:55.686
Oh, shit!

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.091
Is anyone in there?

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.410
Give me the strongbox.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.401
Get the strongbox.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.880
- It's stuck!
- We need some dynamite, Colonel.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.041
Open it.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.441
Leave it to me.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.880
Come on.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.451
You placed this dynamite.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.040
I would be lying if I said
I was not concerned

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.284
over the amount of dynamite
with which you have used on this day.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.643
Whoo!

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.691
I hope there's a strongbox left.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.444
I question your sanity from time
to time, Mr. Cravens.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.926
Here it is, right here.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.565
Can I get some help here?

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.124
There it is. It's still intact.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:23.049
Easy. Easy, fellas. Easy, easy.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.770
Oh, and there it is. Oh, yes.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.641
Easy.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.684
There it is.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.601
It's a decoy.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.926
Why, that sneaky son of a bitch.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.000
His daughter, Alicia.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.287
She's riding alone, southbound.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.763
- Go track her down.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.083
Bring her and everything
she has with her to Silver River.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.407
We'll get it.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.680
So it takes a little longer.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.886
We'll get it.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.886
Yah!

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.206
Bad girl.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.040
Put him here.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.486
Come on now.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.600
- Doc, he's dead.
- Get out.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:08.761
Go on.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.687
Colonel.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.681
- Colonel, we...
- What?

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.170
You better come take a look.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.725
Again?

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.966
What?

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.010
Who are you really?

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.720
Colonel.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.885
Look what I found.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.761
- Take her to Pinky's.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.041
Oh.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:52.203
Oh, Mr. Cravens,
if this is what I think it is...

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.724
Oh, it is.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.490
It's the book.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.562
And it's written in Latin.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.844
Like I suspected.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.569
We must read this at once.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.251
Let us go. Let us go.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.883
You are more than just an outlaw, Guerrero.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.524
You inherited your father's strength

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.283
the Devil tried to subvert.

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:29.005
And we need you here, now,

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.246
to save us all.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.367
What's in that magic potion, Doc?

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:35.845
Holy water.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.611
Holy water?

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.169
Well, that and a bit of morphine.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.520
May cause some hallucinations.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.920
A lot more than just holy water

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.526
and some elixirs in your healing, Doc.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.920
Well, now, many doctors will agree

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.324
that faith plays a large part
in all healing, Guerrero.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.609
More the choices you make
to get further from the Devil...

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.882
Well, now, they'll make you more human.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.405
The more human I get,

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.804
the more vulnerable I get.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.524
Doc, Jackson's got Alicia.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.849
This book has the secret knowledge

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.440
of the mystical.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.240
You got what you want.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.448
Now, get on your horse and go.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.371
The Horn of Lucifer.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.880
"Those who possess this relic

01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:02.445
"shall be capable of unleashing
the power of hell on earth."

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.329
A magnificent prophecy.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.370
What's it mean, Colonel?

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.760
It means that this book

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.322
is nothing more than a set
of instructions for a relic!

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.160
Where is this Horn of Lucifer?

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.120
Far from here.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.724
I don't believe you.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.120
Hell, no.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.520
Now, I'm gonna ask you one last time

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.047
before I take your hand
as a personal keepsake.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.006
Where is the Horn?

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.166
I really don't know.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.880
She doesn't know.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.007
What?

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.244
I can see more than most.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.809
I can see what the truth is and what's lies.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.801
May I?

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.091
Easy. Easy.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.091
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.407
Now...

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.605
Where was the book hidden?

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.569
The church. Why?

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.731
Well, then we start at the church.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.444
Well, now.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.285
Tear this place apart!

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.080
I want to find where the book was.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.650
We're gonna find this relic.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.646
Do you have a plan?

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.880
Yeah.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.000
I'm gonna walk in there,
kill everybody, get my daughter out.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.400
That's not a plan.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.640
That sounds like some wrath-of-God
Old Testament thinkin'.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.767
Goddamn right.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.440
You got anything goes "bang"?

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.601
No.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.688
Here. You might need this.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.526
I don't kill.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.440
Why'd I bring you, Doc?

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.400
Well, you didn't have much of a choice now.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:40.007
I'm here to have your back,
just like I did your mother and father.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.240
You're too young to know my father.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.004
I'm not as young as I look.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.240
There's something you should know.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.160
I didn't tell you 'cause I didn't think
you'd make the right choice.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.651
I didn't tell you everything.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.084
Well, have to wait.
We got other business to take care of now.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.844
It's impossible. He was dead. Twice.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.763
Well, some men are more dead than others.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:14.605
You have more lives than a cat, Guerrero.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.850
And you're gonna die like a dog in a ditch
if you don't release my daughter.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.608
Why would I do that when you
still have what I need?

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.043
You... You already got the book.
What are you talking about?

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.721
Well, you knew all along.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.128
You knew the whole time that book
was worthless all by itself.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.441
I do now.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.565
Now, you can keep the book.
Send my daughter out.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.120
Not so fast.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:48.571
The book isn't worthless by itself
if I have one more thing.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.400
And then one more thing and one
more thing and then another.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.920
When does it end, Jackson?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.240
Bring her out here.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.164
He really doesn't know, does he?

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.606
He needs a relic.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.126
A what?

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.040
The Devil's Horn!

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.800
Hey! You stop movin' or you're gonna die.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.245
Aren't you tired of killin'?

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.880
I'm just gettin' started, sir.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.724
Good. Then kill me.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.411
Because I'm tired of this life.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.521
Oh, I will.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.288
But you harm one strand of hair on her head,

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.081
and there'll be hell to pay.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.921
You say that like it's a bad thing.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.250
Now, where is the Horn, Guerrero?

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.287
No!

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.046
Jackson! You got a mean streak in you!

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.087
Runs right down the center of my back.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.080
Now where is this Horn?

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.366
I think I know.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.484
You're standing right under it.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.520
Come on.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.880
- Let's go.
- There it is.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.485
Right on time.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.643
Colonel, should I go after 'em?

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.120
Oh, no. Forget about Guerrero.
We'll get him in due time.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.328
We have an army to mobilize.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.726
This room is not gonna be
large enough for our corps of men.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.720
Where can we go?

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.491
Any suggestions?

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.520
Town Hall.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.200
Why didn't I think of that?

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.210
Now, get the Horn.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.320
Okay, we're gonna need a couple
of horses and a few days' supplies.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.401
Why?

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520
Because we're getting outta here.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.681
We're not.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.120
Yes, we are. Now, come on. Let's go.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.720
Jackson has the relic.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.160
Yeah, and if he brings the power
of the relic to life,

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.004
we'd better be far away from here.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.001
You afraid?

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.080
Alicia, I've seen the Devil.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.720
You should be afraid.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.882
Some things are bigger than you.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.884
This is bigger than all of us.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.565
We've got to go.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.208
You've been cutting
and running your whole life.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.720
Forgive yourself for the past, Guerrero.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.040
Be a new man.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.560
It's too late.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.290
I'm too old to be new.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.401
Then I guess we're better off without you.

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.240
Leave.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.641
I don't need evil in front and behind me.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.489
I'd say it's time

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.048
we go raise the dead.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.611
In fact,

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.121
I won't be needing this anymore.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.886
What the hell you get us into now, old man?

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.004
Dr. Goldsworthy.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.920
I had a feeling.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.324
We're all sinners, Guerrero.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.891
That's what makes us human.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.882
It's what we do in this human form
that echoes through the ages.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.960
Â¿QuÃ© harÃ¡s, mijo?

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.851
What will you do now?

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.607
Good boy.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.840
Hey. Yeah.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.206
Good boy.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.606
Good boy.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.886
Good boy.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:49.760
Well, boy, go that way,

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.444
might live a little longer.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.850
Go back to town,

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.166
liable to die again.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.445
What do you wanna do, fella?

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.687
Fuck it. Let's go die again.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.200
Jackson Boomer and his gang murdered my nana,

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.040
Sheriff Judkins, Dr. Goldsworthy

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.963
and Squeeze Benteen.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.486
Hell, I know some of you are on edge.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.121
I am, too.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.211
But it's up to us.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.242
This is our home, our town.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.963
Let's bring the fight to 'em.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.249
Who's gonna fight with me?

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.880
No, there's no way.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:56.124
I'll be your deputy.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:03.121
In the name of the archangel
Lucifer, Prince of Darkness,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.880
and by the power of this relic,

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.009
a part of his very own immortal body,

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:17.368
I release these purgatory soldiers

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.128
so that they may serve under my command,

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.368
and bring the wrath of hell upon the earth!

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.531
Whoo!

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.884
Prepare to arm these men.

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.363
Is no one else going to bring
the fight to those murderers?

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.323
Henry.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.480
No way.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.640
Joseph, what about you?

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.210
We're farmers, not fighters.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.360
I will!

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.603
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.160
Load your guns, and let's get ready to fight.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.526
Yeah!

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.246
I'm proud of you, daughter.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.721
Thanks.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.082
Didn't we bury this horse?

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.721
Hyah!

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.126
Jackson! Come on out!
You messed with the wrong town!

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.520
You again.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.761
It's about time.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.920
Jackson Boomer, you and
your men are under arrest.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.765
Put your weapons down and give yourselves up.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.963
I have what I came for.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.802
We're fixin' to blow outta this town.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.969
We got a world to conquer.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.602
We don't have time to mess around
in your no-count town.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.481
There is a need for justice, and you're
gonna hang for what you've done.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.482
Shut that scrawny, little bitch up.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.322
Well, I've already killed you twice,

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.203
but I suppose the third time is the charm.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.369
Me and you, Jackson, mano a mano.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.489
Stand your ground, deputies.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.326
Those guns won't hurt me.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:46.091
These guns aren't for you.

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.842
Well, I was about to leave.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.805
But you made me mad.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:28.967
Mad?

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.890
You ain't seen mad.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:36.845
With the rage of hellfire
and damnation, I come at thee!

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.961
Behind the post!

01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.804
Get back. Come on!

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.964
No, no, no!

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.440
Alicia!

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.840
Alicia!

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.570
We can't defeat them like this!

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.684
We have to find another way!

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.450
I'll keep 'em busy!

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.850
Go inside and get the book!

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.288
See if you can reverse this spell!

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.007
I'm going in! Cover me!

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.930
You deserve to hang.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.762
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Same as.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.800
Can't take that to court.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.764
Don't see no court here.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:01.129
You're fucked now, bitch.

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.481
I'm used to getting fucked.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.049
Mr. Cravens, follow me.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.560
Get the book.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.490
It's time to leave.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:41.968
It's amazing how much destruction

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.371
this book can do!

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.727
Jackson Boomer, you can't win this one.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:06.324
I stand against everything you stand for.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.560
That's your problem, Guerrero.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.166
That's why you haven't got a chance.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:20.320
The moment you relinquished
and abandoned Satan,

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:24.320
you relinquished all the power
he bestowed upon you,

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.609
and now it belongs to me.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.562
I don't need Satan's power
to ram that Horn up your ass.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:37.880
Well, you see, the man downstairs
has a better plan than that.

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:41.320
You could just walk away right now,

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.483
and this way,

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.284
you'd be saving her.

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.720
Why should he release me?

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:56.331
Well, you're not the man you
once were, and now he has me.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.920
Ah. Just like you. It's a trick.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.160
Oh, no, no.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.768
He's pleased with all the evil
that you've unleashed on the earth.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.770
He wants to express his gratitude
and his forgiveness.

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.446
I don't need his appreciation...

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.325
Or his forgiveness.

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.521
Fire!

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.571
Never bring a knife to a gunfight!

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.961
No!

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:10.851
Hand it over, Alicia.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.325
Don't do it!

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.370
Goddamn, Guerrero!

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.166
Why don't you just die already?

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.365
Dying's not in my future, asshole!

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.281
No.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.881
You want that Horn? Here it is!

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.885
Are you okay?

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.166
You were willing to risk
your life to save mine.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.282
Isn't that what a father's supposed to do?

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.802
No, no, no. Don't die on me now.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.441
No, Papa.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:39.166
Boy, I'm getting too old for this dyin' shit.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.800
You ain't that easy to kill after all,
are you, old man?

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:48.088
You don't know the half of it, girl.
