WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:04.138
I know that you've been known to
comment on the mayor's physique,

00:04.172 --> 00:05.139
but I didn't...
Yeah, I like him!

00:05.173 --> 00:06.574
And I'm divorced now,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.609
so who's to say
he won't like me back?

00:08.642 --> 00:09.610
We were in love once,
and Lord help me,

00:09.643 --> 00:12.213
I still think I am.
Forget about about Lavon.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.414
You've got Walt.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.648
Mayor Hayes and I
are friends,

00:14.682 --> 00:15.649
but we both
belong elsewhere.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.618
Glad to hear it.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.619
I've never had a real
relationship, Wade.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.653
I don't know
how to do this.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.688
Me neither.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.456
Sometimes you just
got to wing it.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.757
We're gonna drive each
other crazy sometimes.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.426
But you got to remember,
that's part of

00:25.459 --> 00:27.461
what brought us together
in the first place.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.136
MAN (deep voice):
 Juices.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.437
WOMAN (sexy voice):
 Strawberries.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.307
Get your fill in Fillmore.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.774
MAN:
 Sweet.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.810
WOMAN:
 Strawberries.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.513
Get your fill in Fillmore.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.849
WOMAN: All the strawberries
 you could ever desire.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.085
It's strawberry season
in Fillmore.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.753
Come and get your fill.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.623
WOMAN:
 Strawberries.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.795
Fillmore made
a damn commercial?

01:01.829 --> 01:04.165
My pal at WYET
snuck me that copy.

01:04.197 --> 01:05.766
Bluebell's been the number one
Alabama destination

01:05.799 --> 01:06.800
for strawberry picking
forever.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.502
I know.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.338
Mayor Gainey's trying to
hijack our berry business.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.640
Looks like he might
just get it, too.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.775
Ah, yep. Just like
he stole our Mardi Gras.

01:14.808 --> 01:15.876
Mm.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.877
Sneaky bastard.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.147
That he is.
That he is.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.481
This commercial
running already?

01:20.514 --> 01:22.116
No, it doesn't air for
another three days.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.485
But, you know,
I had a thought.
Hmm?

01:24.518 --> 01:25.653
I ever tell you what I did
freshman year at college?

01:25.686 --> 01:28.289
You about to confess something
I don't want to hear about?

01:28.322 --> 01:30.391
I took a
filmmaking class.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.692
Why don't we just make
our own commercial?

01:31.725 --> 01:33.161
You-you think
you can do that?

01:33.194 --> 01:34.328
I won awards
in that class.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.330
Huh.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.199
Can you have it
ready in three days?

01:38.232 --> 01:39.500
I can have it
ready in two.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.305
No, you were right, this
is a nice change of pace

01:44.338 --> 01:45.673
from breakfast
at Lavon's.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.740
However...

01:46.774 --> 01:48.776
The eggs do taste a little bit
like beer, don't they?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.144
Mm-hmm.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.579
Oh, hey, before I forget,
do you want me

01:51.612 --> 01:52.780
to put your name
on the list for tonight?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.682
Your show?
That's tonight?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.884
Yeah, Mattress Police
Live in Daphne.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.752
All the cool kids
are gonna be there.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.389
(sighs) You know, it's just,
it's such a crazy week.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.257
Brick's gone,
so I'm on call.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.625
Hey, but if you
need me there

02:04.658 --> 02:06.194
to do he whole "I'm
with the band thing..."

02:06.227 --> 02:07.828
Trust me, I don't,
all right?

02:07.861 --> 02:09.597
I don't need you
to be my groupie.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.865
And I don't need
you to be mine.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.301
That's kind of what
makes us awesome.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.702
To not being a couple

02:14.735 --> 02:15.903
that needs to do
everything together.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.438
To not wearing
matching shirts

02:17.471 --> 02:19.640
or eating off each
other's plates.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.575
(phone vibrating)

02:21.609 --> 02:23.177
(clears throat)

02:23.211 --> 02:24.512
It's the Alabama
Department of Health.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.413
I got to go.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.880
Uh, you mind if
I finish your hash browns?

02:26.914 --> 02:27.881
What did I just say?

02:27.915 --> 02:29.183
Well...

02:33.754 --> 02:35.856
AnnaBeth, I need
some advice.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.491
Mm-hmm.
It's Walt.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.892
I feel that
there's a storm

02:38.926 --> 02:41.695
on the horizon of
our relationship.

02:41.729 --> 02:42.830
He just called me and
invited himself over

02:42.863 --> 02:45.466
to make dinner tomorrow
before he goes out of town.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.500
Oh, my God.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.501
I know.

02:47.535 --> 02:48.936
He wants to
make me dinner.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.971
I mean, that's code for that
he hates my cooking, right?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.206
I mean, it's over.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.774
I don't think so.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.909
Sweetie, he wants
to have sex.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.211
Sex?

02:57.245 --> 02:59.280
But are you sure?

02:59.313 --> 03:01.349
Isn't that fast?

03:01.382 --> 03:02.550
I mean, we've
only been dating

03:02.583 --> 03:03.951
for a little more
than eight weeks.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.820
Eigh... eight weeks?

03:06.854 --> 03:07.821
Mm-hmm.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.889
Sweetie, remember when

03:08.922 --> 03:10.691
we were watching
the Olympics

03:10.724 --> 03:12.660
and those opening
ceremonies went on forever?

03:12.693 --> 03:13.794
Yes, and we were like,

03:13.827 --> 03:14.762
when are we gonna
see some gymnastics?

03:14.795 --> 03:17.365
Exactly. Trust me,
eight weeks is long enough.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.433
Oh, my God.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.602
This is something
that you want to do, right?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.837
What?
Well, hell yes!

03:23.871 --> 03:25.939
Oh, my God.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.675
Whew!
Suddenly I'm nervous.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.643
I feel like I should
do some Pilates

03:29.677 --> 03:32.446
or toning or refinish
my floors or...

03:32.480 --> 03:33.714
Is that normal?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.449
Some of that, mm-hmm.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.985
(gasps) Why can't it be
tomorrow night already?

03:38.018 --> 03:39.820
(giggles)

03:39.853 --> 03:43.624
Okay, not to put
any pressure on you,

03:43.657 --> 03:45.926
but I want to be wild.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.028
This commercial has got to
drive the mayor of Fillmore

03:48.061 --> 03:49.863
to tears of despair.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.799
Well, then,
prepare to be wowed.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.000
(grunts)

03:53.033 --> 03:56.970
We open on you, the
mayor, Lavon Hayes,

03:57.004 --> 03:58.906
just strolling
down the road,

03:58.939 --> 04:01.709
as you happen upon
a stranded tourist,

04:01.742 --> 04:03.511
who just wants to
pick strawberries.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.878
I'm intrigued.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.514
Her car's broken down.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.848
She's lost.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.350
She's confused.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.852
But you take her by the hand

04:11.885 --> 04:14.322
and lead her
right into...

04:14.355 --> 04:15.323
(snapping fingers)

04:15.356 --> 04:16.189
Tom, card.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.625
Sorry, I got caught up
in the drama.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.892
Into the town
of BlueBell,

04:19.927 --> 04:22.996
which comes alive
before your eyes.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.599
A strawberry paradise.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.301
As strawberry
vines reach

04:27.335 --> 04:29.403
for miles across
the skyline.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.904
Strawberry novelty cars

04:30.938 --> 04:31.905
motor down the street.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.607
Animated strawberries
float through the air.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.608
We'll do that
with green screen.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.743
And, oh,

04:35.776 --> 04:36.710
what's that sound?

04:36.744 --> 04:38.712
Is that Taylor Swift?

04:38.746 --> 04:39.913
What is she singing?

04:39.947 --> 04:40.914
That's right.

04:40.948 --> 04:41.982
You guessed it.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.851
"Strawberry Fields Forever."

04:43.884 --> 04:44.885
As the two of you

04:44.918 --> 04:46.554
get into a giant,

04:46.587 --> 04:47.621
strawberry-shaped
hot air balloon,

04:47.655 --> 04:48.789
you begin to float away

04:48.822 --> 04:50.724
as the residents
of BlueBell

04:50.758 --> 04:52.893
assemble below you,
smiling, happy,

04:52.926 --> 04:54.895
waving and shouting...

04:54.928 --> 04:58.766
BOTH: "BlueBell, it's yours
for the picking!"

05:01.935 --> 05:03.671
Wow.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.006
That sounds amazing.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.841
You can do all this in two days?

05:07.875 --> 05:11.011
Yes, as long as I have
mandatory town participation,

05:11.044 --> 05:13.814
$1.2 million,
Taylor Swift and a crane.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.850
(laughs)

05:16.884 --> 05:20.087
Uh, (clears throat)
I want this, George,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.523
but the best
I can do is, uh,

05:22.556 --> 05:25.993
$378, whoever we can convince
from the town to help out

05:26.026 --> 05:27.928
and my step stool
from the garage.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.797
Deal.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.765
(laughs)

05:31.799 --> 05:33.967
Ah, remember,
this has to be kick-ass.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.769
You have my word.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.471
Fillmore ass
will be kicked.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.972
(cell phone ringtone playing)

05:39.006 --> 05:40.474
Oh, excuse me.
Of course.

05:42.643 --> 05:43.677
Hey, Zoe.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.513
What's going on?

05:45.546 --> 05:47.147
It's the flu.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.783
Department of Health called
doctors all over the state.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.085
See the red dots?
Confirmed outbreaks.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.488
Mobile, Daphne, Fairhope.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.156
It's closing in.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.925
The flu can't hit
BlueBell, Zoe.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.427
It'll cripple
our commercial.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.494
Yeah.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.663
Oh, and-and the health
of the town.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.565
Yeah.
I was on E.R. rotation

06:04.598 --> 06:07.000
in New York during H1N1;
that was scary stuff.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.869
Okay, how do you
want to handle it?

06:08.902 --> 06:11.939
As the acting medical captain
of the S.S. BlueBell,

06:11.972 --> 06:13.674
I've called for reinforcements.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.908
Rose!

06:15.943 --> 06:17.678
What do you need, Captain?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.680
We need an inventory
of supplies.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.783
Antivirals, hydration fluids,
pain relievers...

06:22.816 --> 06:24.084
Why the mask?
You sick already?

06:24.117 --> 06:25.886
No, but I have tickets
to the Black Keys

06:25.919 --> 06:26.754
in Gulf Shores tomorrow night

06:26.787 --> 06:28.956
and my mom is finally
gonna let me go.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.691
I'm not taking
any chances.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.959
By the way, last mask.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.761
Add it to the list.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.065
LEMON: Did you even hear
a word that I said?

06:38.098 --> 06:40.434
Blah, blah, blah, you can't
stay over tomorrow night,

06:40.468 --> 06:42.035
even though you promised
Daddy that you would.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.672
I have very important,
preexisting plans.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.039
I will be unreachable.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.008
Let me guess.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.611
You and Walt gonna play
Chutes and Ladders all night?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.980
You know what? Why don't
I get you a babysitter.

06:53.013 --> 06:53.981
I'll just call Delma.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.148
No.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.852
Lemon, I am 15 years old.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.521
I do not need a babysitter.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.589
Are you sure?

07:01.622 --> 07:02.990
I'm gonna sit at home,

07:03.023 --> 07:04.958
watch TV all night,
and then go to bed.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.694
If I need you,
I will text you.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.829
Fine.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.898
But don't need me.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.638
(door closes)

07:21.241 --> 07:23.210
Tina? Magnolia.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.212
Party at my house
tomorrow night.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.080
Tell everyone.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.251
ROSE:
 I don't get it.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.886
If my boyfriend
were in a band,

07:32.920 --> 07:33.954
I would just
die every night

07:33.987 --> 07:35.756
I couldn't be in
the front row.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.758
Well, that's because
you are in high school.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.792
With me and Wade,
it's not like that.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.994
I should call him
and check in on him though.

07:41.028 --> 07:41.795
How are the signs coming?

07:41.829 --> 07:43.964
"Screw the flu,
wash your hands."

07:43.997 --> 07:45.733
Great, it's pithy and it rhymes.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.836
We'll put it up in all the
public restrooms, restaurants...

07:48.869 --> 07:50.504
WADE: Hey.
Hey, what's up, Bon Jovi?

07:50.538 --> 07:52.873
Oh, you know,
usual rock star stuff:

07:52.906 --> 07:54.141
hookers, drugs.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.276
About to do sound check.
What you up to?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.811
We are all on flu watch.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.813
But I thought I'd call
to say good luck.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.515
Shake that skinny butt,
Kinsella.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.016
Sound ain't gonna check itself.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.985
ZOE:
Who was that?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.987
That sounded like...
Lily Anne.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.689
Think you two have met, right?

08:08.722 --> 08:09.590
Lily Anne Lonergan?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.859
Your wack-a-doo
ex-bandmate who used to be

08:11.892 --> 08:12.860
in love with you?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.161
You didn't tell me
you were playing with her.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.529
Oh, I sure did.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.730
I told you
it's a Mattress Police reunion.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.666
It's not my fault
you can't remember

08:18.699 --> 08:20.033
who's in the band.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.169
Come on! You know I get
superstitious about sound check.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.971
(sighs)
Look, baby, I better go

08:24.004 --> 08:25.238
before Lily Anne's head explodes

08:25.272 --> 08:27.240
into a fine mist
of antidepressants

08:27.274 --> 08:28.609
and grapefruit juice.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.177
I'll call you later, all right?

08:30.210 --> 08:31.211
Bye.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.947
Holy cannoli!

08:33.981 --> 08:35.015
Wade's performing with
Lily Anne Lonergan,

08:35.048 --> 08:36.283
and you're not there?

08:36.316 --> 08:38.018
That's trouble.
No!

08:38.051 --> 08:39.318
No, it's fine.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.220
It's not fine.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.322
A girl like that is
capable of anything.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.858
Lily Anne Lonergan
is super hot and super crazy.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.226
It's like every guy's
dream combo.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.028
(door opens)

08:48.061 --> 08:50.230
Zoe, I got a solution.
We need to talk.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.865
In private.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.967
What am I looking at?

08:54.001 --> 08:56.570
BlueBell town
bylaws, clause 13C:

08:56.604 --> 08:58.305
the infectious
disease ordinance.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.007
In a state of
emergency, the mayor

09:00.040 --> 09:01.642
and the Board of
Health director--

09:01.675 --> 09:02.976
that's you until
Brick comes back--

09:03.010 --> 09:04.978
have the power to invoke
a medical quarantine.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.013
Meaning?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.981
We close the border
of BlueBell for 48 hours.

09:08.015 --> 09:08.916
Close the border?

09:08.949 --> 09:10.951
This is all because
of your commercial.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.019
Well, sure it's for
the commercial.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.988
But it's also for the health
and welfare of BlueBell.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.223
It's for you, for me,
it's for all of us.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.925
For 48 hours,
no one goes out,

09:17.958 --> 09:18.792
no one comes in.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.995
Not even someone
who might be out of town

09:22.029 --> 09:24.264
with their super-hot-but-kind-
of-crazy ex-girlfriend?

09:24.297 --> 09:25.666
You want to fight the flu?

09:25.699 --> 09:27.034
This is the best
weapon we got.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.671
(sighs)

09:35.976 --> 09:38.612
(car horn honks)

09:38.646 --> 09:40.748
(seagulls calling)

09:40.781 --> 09:42.916
(birds singing)

09:53.026 --> 09:54.261
(doorbell rings)

09:58.065 --> 10:00.000
Lemon.
What's wrong?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.268
The worst thing
imaginable:

10:01.301 --> 10:03.671
my romantic future
is on life support.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.972
Did you hear about
this immoral quarantine

10:05.005 --> 10:07.074
being imposed
upon our town

10:07.107 --> 10:08.642
by Zoe Hart and
Mayor Hayes?

10:08.676 --> 10:09.843
Once again,
big government

10:09.877 --> 10:11.411
just reaching
into our bedroom.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.080
Yeah, they're trying
to keep the flu away.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.214
I don't care
about the flu.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.716
I care about
tomorrow night.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.685
And if no one can get into
town, then Walt can't...

10:17.718 --> 10:19.086
What if you postpone?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.954
No, there will be
no postponing.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.756
You yourself said that
eight weeks is pushing it.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.824
And Walt's going
out of town,

10:23.857 --> 10:25.325
and what if he comes back
no longer interested?

10:25.358 --> 10:28.028
Okay, settle down.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.229
Do you want me to get a bag
for you to breathe into?

10:29.262 --> 10:30.931
We need to stop
this quarantine.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.900
Okay, um, mm.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.835
Did you read
the fine print here?

10:34.868 --> 10:37.337
No. My eyes were
blurry with rage.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.773
They're required to
hold a town meeting

10:39.807 --> 10:41.008
to vote on the quarantine,

10:41.041 --> 10:43.176
to listen to opposing
points of view.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.978
It's all very democratic.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.246
Great.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.181
Let's go let
the freedom ring.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.050
Historically,
quarantine has proven

10:50.083 --> 10:52.920
very effective in
limiting the transmissions

10:52.953 --> 10:55.255
of communicable
diseases.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.323
Boring.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.693
Now, come on, now, we are
falling asleep back here.

10:59.727 --> 11:00.961
Okay, look people, um,

11:00.994 --> 11:03.997
think of the quarantine
as a giant shark net,

11:04.031 --> 11:06.399
and the flu is like
a hungry great white,

11:06.433 --> 11:09.069
desperate to eat
the people of BlueBell.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.137
Now, it's out there, people.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.404
But I just bought my tickets

11:11.438 --> 11:13.006
to see the Globetrotters
in Daphne.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.808
My Zumba class is out of town.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.043
48 hours

11:16.076 --> 11:17.210
is like 48 weeks.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.379
(crowd clamoring)
Mr. Mayor!

11:19.412 --> 11:22.783
Are we or are we not
in America?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.918
Course we're in America, but...
Well, then here

11:24.952 --> 11:27.420
in America, we have rights.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.022
The right to come

11:29.056 --> 11:31.324
and go as we please.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.361
Yeah. Uh, the freedom of...

11:34.394 --> 11:36.229
movement.
GEORGE:
Mr. Mayor,

11:36.263 --> 11:37.865
if I may interject.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.834
That one is actually not
in the Bill of Rights, and...

11:40.868 --> 11:42.702
Was I talking to you?!
(crowd oohing)

11:44.504 --> 11:46.173
Let's just get
back to the point.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.876
Will there be any exceptions
to this quarantine?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.410
What kind of exceptions?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.846
Um, just spitballing,
uh, let's say that

11:52.880 --> 11:56.850
somebody needs an emergency
organ transplant.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.919
ANNABETH: Right!
And the only organ

11:58.952 --> 12:01.755
available is an organ...

12:01.789 --> 12:03.390
out of town.
Yep.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.159
Actually, I-I think
that's a great idea.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.294
It is?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.962
Medically speaking,

12:08.996 --> 12:11.098
I think that it would be
reasonable for someone

12:11.131 --> 12:14.434
to enter town if they can
show proof of a flu vaccine.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.435
I second that motion!

12:15.468 --> 12:17.070
You sure about this?

12:17.104 --> 12:18.939
Captain of the
 S.S. BlueBell.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.910
All right, all those
in favor, say "aye."

12:22.943 --> 12:24.311
ALL:
Aye!

12:24.344 --> 12:27.114
You might just have
a future in politics.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.454
Hey, uh, Lavon?

12:34.487 --> 12:37.057
Hey, uh, this
commercial, uh...

12:37.090 --> 12:39.492
We really need
to cast our girl.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.561
The role of this tourist
is key, and we need

12:41.594 --> 12:43.997
real chemistry, so I was
thinking, I don't know, Wanda,

12:44.031 --> 12:45.966
maybe Babs Foster,

12:45.999 --> 12:47.467
uh, Susie the
hairdresser...

12:47.500 --> 12:49.336
It should be AnnaBeth.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.571
Eh, AnnaBeth,
I-I just don't...

12:51.604 --> 12:52.806
I don't see...

12:54.307 --> 12:56.109
What just happened?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.311
You want me to be in
a commercial with you?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.280
I-I don't know.
Well, it's important

13:00.313 --> 13:02.415
to the town that
this part be played

13:02.449 --> 13:04.852
by someone with
an appealing energy.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.319
A face
that the audience

13:06.353 --> 13:08.822
can't help
but fall in love with.

13:08.856 --> 13:09.823
Ain't that right,
George?

13:09.857 --> 13:12.325
Yes, yes, of course,
but we should discuss it.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.360
Yeah, I'll do it.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.128
I-I mean,

13:15.162 --> 13:16.897
if it's important
to the town.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.331
Great. Rehearsal
first thing tomorrow,

13:18.365 --> 13:19.499
town square.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.333
(chuckles):
Okay!

13:20.367 --> 13:22.169
(quietly):
All right!

13:22.202 --> 13:24.471
Okay, yeah,
we really need

13:24.504 --> 13:26.139
to work on
our collaborative process.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.341
You and AnnaBeth--
am I missing something here?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.210
I just want what's
best for the town.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.545
Oh, really? Why don't you look
me in the eyes and say that?

13:32.579 --> 13:34.047
Oh, my goodness!

13:34.081 --> 13:36.483
AnnaBeth, Mayor Hayes
is totally into you.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.151
What? No.
I-I don't think...

13:38.185 --> 13:40.387
"A face you can't help
but fall in love with." Come on!

13:40.420 --> 13:41.922
It doesn't matter.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.123
There is no
world in which

13:43.156 --> 13:46.059
I could pursue a relationship
with a man Lemon once loved.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.095
It's basic girl code.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.496
Yes, that's true.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.864
Girl code.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.868
Are you still gonna
do the commercial?

13:54.902 --> 13:57.504
Well, it wouldn't be
fair to deny the world

13:57.537 --> 13:59.072
my appealing energy.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.140
ZOE:
 Please tell me

14:00.173 --> 14:01.274
that you're kidding.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.876
Well, I could,
but I'd be lying.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.244
You never got a flu shot?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.980
I just passed a vaccine
exception to the quarantine

14:07.014 --> 14:08.081
so that you could...

14:08.115 --> 14:10.117
Who doesn't get a flu shot?!

14:10.150 --> 14:12.152
Me, all right? And you know
what else I've never gotten?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.954
The flu.
You do the math, Doc.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.188
Idiot! You do the math.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.124
Now you can't come home
for 48 hours.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.992
Please, it's not like
I got to cross a moat.

14:19.026 --> 14:19.993
All right?
Who's gonna know?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.129
Me. I'll know. And it's the law.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.597
You just played a concert
in the middle of Flu-Ville.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.234
Well, I guess I will
have to sleep here, then.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.501
Where exactly is "here"?

14:28.535 --> 14:31.604
(Lily Anne
speaking indistinctly)

14:31.638 --> 14:34.107
On... a couch.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.008
Whose couch?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.043
(groans quietly)

14:36.076 --> 14:38.245
It's, uh, Lily Anne's couch.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.446
Look, don't freak out.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.514
Me and Lily Anne,
we're ancient history.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.316
Great. You enjoy that couch.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.952
But don't even think
about all the other things

14:44.985 --> 14:46.319
that you should've
been vaccinated against

14:46.353 --> 14:47.520
before sleeping on it.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.461
Just like old times.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.930
(clears throat)
No, not until you, uh,

14:56.964 --> 15:00.100
throw a beer bottle at my head,
it shatters against the wall,

15:00.133 --> 15:02.069
and the neighbors
call the police.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.237
(laughs)

15:04.271 --> 15:05.405
Uh...

15:05.438 --> 15:08.441
hey, listen, if it's
any trouble, I can...

15:08.475 --> 15:10.110
get a hotel or...

15:10.143 --> 15:11.711
Since when can you
afford a hotel?

15:11.744 --> 15:15.682
Well, by "hotel," I mean
I could sleep in my car.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.117
(laughs)

15:17.150 --> 15:20.487
I'm happy to have
the company.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.655
Uh...
(clears throat)

15:22.689 --> 15:24.992
Lily Anne, just...

15:25.025 --> 15:27.594
so everything's
on the table, uh,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.596
I'm still with Zoe.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.064
(laughs):
The doctor, right?

15:31.098 --> 15:33.166
The one who said
you couldn't come home tonight?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.234
Yeah, I know.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.568
I just say
it because...

15:35.602 --> 15:37.537
Well, just so everything's
on the table,

15:37.570 --> 15:42.109
you should know this couch
is really uncomfortable.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.210
Oh.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.511
(chuckles)

15:44.544 --> 15:46.980
That makes two of us.

15:52.019 --> 15:55.022
*

15:55.055 --> 15:57.991
See, BlueBell's not just
a place to pick strawberries.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.760
No, BlueBell is
a whole experience.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.329
You have to say that;

16:02.362 --> 16:03.563
you're the mayor.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.765
Well, don't just take
my word for it.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.167
Cue the fire truck!

16:07.200 --> 16:09.436
ALL:
BlueBell!

16:09.469 --> 16:11.771
It's yours for the picking!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.006
Cue the human pyramid!

16:17.277 --> 16:19.012
ALL:
BlueBell!

16:19.046 --> 16:20.580
It's yours for the picking!

16:20.613 --> 16:22.149
Cue the hot air balloon!

16:26.453 --> 16:28.488
Hot air balloon!

16:28.521 --> 16:30.323
Cut on rehearsal!

16:30.357 --> 16:32.225
Cody! Cody, where's
the hot air balloon?

16:32.259 --> 16:33.593
Sorry, George.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.761
My cousin never called me back,

16:34.794 --> 16:36.763
but I can get you
a bouncy house by noon.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.565
A bouncy house?
Mm-hmm.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.233
Is this a joke?

16:40.267 --> 16:41.734
Okay, take ten
minutes, everybody,

16:41.768 --> 16:43.470
while I process
my disappointment.

16:47.707 --> 16:51.111
Lavon, AnnaBeth...

16:51.144 --> 16:53.113
Chemistry, wow.
You were not lying.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.148
I'd love to see even
more of it, though.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.050
Uh, you're the director.
Whatever you need.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.186
Hey, A.B., you are
falling for this town.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.653
Don't be afraid of
physical contact.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.155
You know,
grab his arm.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.490
Lavon, touch
her back.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.657
We are selling
a feeling here.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.492
Mm-hmm.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.594
LAVON:
Yeah.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.733
What the hell?
Charlie, Charlie, hey!

17:14.767 --> 17:16.803
Hey, buddy, uh, these are,
these are not lunch.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.505
These are workin' pies.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.073
Sorry.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.508
Yeah.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.210
Yeah, uh, props!

17:23.242 --> 17:25.044
Props, we need some more pies!

17:25.877 --> 17:27.847
LAVON:
 S-So, uh,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.749
you want to practice
our lines, or...?

17:29.782 --> 17:32.519
I-I actually have
somewhere to be.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.820
Oh, no, that's fine.
We don't have to...

17:33.853 --> 17:35.722
But maybe we
can meet later.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.590
I mean, to practice.

17:37.624 --> 17:38.691
Only if you...

17:38.725 --> 17:42.362
Maybe around dinnertime.
Uh, we can do it at my place.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.097
Maybe around 6:00?

17:44.131 --> 17:44.864
Great!

17:44.897 --> 17:46.633
All right. Okay, uh,

17:46.666 --> 17:47.867
toodle-oo. Okay.
Toodle-oo!

17:47.900 --> 17:50.203
Oh, actually, I got to...
Yeah, I'm this way.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.504
All right.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.739
Wade, it's me.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.774
I haven't heard
from you all day.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.344
Give me a call. Bye.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.645
(sneezes)

17:59.679 --> 18:01.614
Cody, I heard that.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.616
Step away from
the licorice.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.785
What, Doc?
It's just allergies.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.787
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.690
All right, come back to the
office with me. Let's go!

18:11.858 --> 18:13.860
(sighs)
My seats were fifth row.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.729
You'd have been close enough
to see the Black Keys sweat.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.799
Uh, how many times do we
have to hear about this?

18:19.832 --> 18:21.668
I just wish I
had something

18:21.701 --> 18:23.770
to get my mind off
my disappointment.

18:23.803 --> 18:28.107
Right. If only someone were
having a party or something.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.845
Fine, I'll send
you an evite.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.147
(squeals)
Oh, my God!

18:34.181 --> 18:35.148
We're going
to a Breeland party!

18:35.182 --> 18:37.884
Just don't invite any
of your loser friends.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.454
Ooh, Red Vines--
my favorite.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.857
So, I think
I have tonight covered.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.926
I have my Mozart
 Is for Lovers CD,

18:46.959 --> 18:48.428
I have the table set,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.330
and I've narrowed it down
to two outfits--

18:50.363 --> 18:52.799
the pantsuit or...

18:52.832 --> 18:54.867
a skort and a cardy.
What do you think?

18:55.835 --> 18:59.606
I-I... Uh, is that
your fine china?

18:59.639 --> 19:00.673
Uh-huh.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.175
Lemon, I say
this with love,

19:02.209 --> 19:03.943
but every one of your
choices is wrong.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.179
I'm sorry.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.547
Every one?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.349
Tonight is not a dinner party,
it's sex.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.750
That means candles,
clothes that

19:10.783 --> 19:12.252
come off quickly,
replace Mozart

19:12.285 --> 19:13.853
with Rosanne Cash,
and, dear God,

19:13.886 --> 19:15.888
lose the fine china.
But I never get to use it.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.790
Sweetie, if everything
goes the way it ought to,

19:17.824 --> 19:20.860
those dishes will be swept
to the floor with great force.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.963
You think that we might, um...

19:23.996 --> 19:25.565
on the table?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.800
I certainly hope so.
I want you to be prepared.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.702
Any surface is fair game.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.903
I just want
tonight to be perfect.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.805
I used to be good
at this, I swear.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.842
It used to be like second
nature, and now I don't have

19:35.875 --> 19:37.744
the right lights, the right
music, the right clothes.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.480
Lemon, it's
gonna be okay.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.349
I don't even have
the right plates for sex.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.950
I have everything you need.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.486
Why don't you take a short nap,
get your head together,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.388
and then come
over to my place.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.857
AnnaBeth.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.691
Hmm?
You are the best,

19:51.724 --> 19:54.727
most loyal friend
in the whole world.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.831
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

19:58.865 --> 19:59.932
(whispers):
Thank you.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.377
George? It's AnnaBeth.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.812
I have to pull out
of the commercial.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.848
I-I think
I'm coming down with the flu.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.286
Please pass on
my regrets to Lavon.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.523
CODY:
 Are you sure?

20:23.556 --> 20:24.991
This is a hundred
percent accurate.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.859
It's the flu.
What happened?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.428
Did you violate quarantine?
No.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.663
I haven't left
town in months.
All right,

20:30.697 --> 20:32.699
well, go home
and straight to bed.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.667
Don't talk to anyone;
don't breathe on anyone.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.269
Lots of aspirin and fluids.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.370
Yes, ma'am.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.406
(sighs)

20:41.874 --> 20:42.842
(line ringing)

20:42.875 --> 20:43.943
(clears throat)

20:43.976 --> 20:44.977
(beep)

20:45.011 --> 20:46.979
Me again.
Where are you?

20:47.013 --> 20:49.682
I am not okay with you sleeping
at your ex-girlfriend's

20:49.716 --> 20:52.352
then not picking up the phone,
in case you're wondering.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.987
Also, I still cannot believe
you didn't get a flu shot.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.590
Call me back.

20:57.624 --> 20:58.925
(gasps, yells)

20:58.958 --> 20:59.992
(coughs)

21:00.927 --> 21:03.029
What the hell?
The flu?

21:04.897 --> 21:05.998
How is this possible?

21:06.032 --> 21:08.435
Hey, Patrick.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.569
It's cousin Cody again.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.004
Look, they're really pushing me
on this hot air balloon;

21:12.038 --> 21:13.706
I promised you'd deliver.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.741
Call me back.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.908
(sneezes)

21:15.942 --> 21:17.477
Sheesh!

21:17.510 --> 21:19.612
Say it, don't spray it, brother.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.383
Gesundheit!

21:26.953 --> 21:28.788
(blowing nose)

21:39.466 --> 21:41.968
I don't know why we can't just
let people be sick at home.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.070
It's called
a containment strategy.
You know what I read?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.938
I read that seeing live music

21:45.972 --> 21:47.740
actually helps the body
fight off illnesses.

21:47.774 --> 21:48.875
That's ironic, right?

21:48.908 --> 21:51.544
For the millionth time,
I am sorry about the concert.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.580
This quarantine is no
picnic for me, either.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.682
I still haven't
heard from Wade.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.485
He's probably on his way
to see the Black Keys.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.653
I hear there are
seats available!

22:02.755 --> 22:05.492
See, BlueBell's not just
a place to pick strawberries.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.795
BlueBell is
a whole experience.

22:08.828 --> 22:12.665
Well, you have to say
that; you're the mayor.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.901
Uh... cut!

22:14.934 --> 22:17.604
Sorry, "cut"?

22:17.637 --> 22:19.572
Uh, y-you don't
get to say "cut."

22:19.606 --> 22:21.841
George, I don't think this is
working without AnnaBeth.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.676
Uh, no offense.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.044
CRICKETT: Or it could be
what we're saying.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.046
It feels real
expository.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.047
Uh, Crickett,
I'm sorry.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.048
Lavon, can I
have a minute?

22:29.081 --> 22:30.817
Yeah.

22:32.785 --> 22:33.986
(clears throat)

22:34.020 --> 22:35.955
Look, we're all
making do here, okay?

22:35.988 --> 22:38.090
I got half a crew,
AnnaBeth's sick.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.026
But this thing's really coming
to life with you and Crickett.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.794
Yeah, I'm-I'm just
not feeling it.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.530
You're not feeling it.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.132
Okay, well, dude, listen,
it is working.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.800
It is working like gangbusters.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.669
Well, not for me.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.771
Hey, I'm-I'm thinking maybe
I should go bring AnnaBeth

22:51.804 --> 22:52.872
some of my mom's
chicken soup,

22:52.905 --> 22:54.173
see if I can't
rally her back to health.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.843
Okay, just so I'm clear, uh,
we have a day and a half

22:56.876 --> 23:00.680
to shoot this commercial, and
you want to take AnnaBeth soup.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.549
You're kidding
me, right?

23:02.582 --> 23:03.583
This is a joke.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.851
No, it's really good soup.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.185
You're the one
that wanted a commercial

23:06.218 --> 23:07.887
that would put Fillmore
to shame.

23:07.920 --> 23:08.888
Yeah.
And you want

23:08.921 --> 23:10.022
to throw all that away

23:10.056 --> 23:11.524
to take your girlfriend
some soup.

23:11.558 --> 23:12.525
What?

23:12.559 --> 23:14.961
No, no,
she's not my girlfriend.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.464
She's a-a constituent
who just happens to be ill.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.998
And as mayor...

23:19.031 --> 23:20.867
No, I am a constituent.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.001
And never once

23:22.034 --> 23:23.503
have you brought me soup.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.137
Let's just admit
what's going on here.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.907
George, sometimes soup
is just soup.

23:28.908 --> 23:29.976
I-I'll see you later.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.581
Yeah, well, you know,
sometimes soup is just...

23:34.614 --> 23:35.948
Just not this time!

23:36.883 --> 23:38.618
Not when it's love soup!

23:40.019 --> 23:43.623
We're taking
an early lunch, everyone.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.761
ANNABETH:
Okay.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.997
I've got two bottles
of red wine,

23:51.030 --> 23:54.467
a bunch of CDs and
candles for the bedroom,

23:54.501 --> 23:56.202
because light is
the enemy of sex.

23:56.235 --> 24:00.840
Okay, so I read all the parts
that you highlighted-- whew!--

24:00.873 --> 24:02.909
and I just have
a couple of questions.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.679
How does one even go about
building a sex dungeon?

24:06.713 --> 24:08.581
Are there, uh,
specialized contractors

24:08.615 --> 24:09.849
who do that sort of thing?

24:09.882 --> 24:12.752
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.554
Okay, here's another question.

24:14.587 --> 24:18.558
So, I don't know, um,
when in the night

24:18.591 --> 24:20.092
that I kick off
the-the main event.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.495
Is it when he first
walks in the door?

24:22.529 --> 24:23.563
Or after dinner?

24:23.596 --> 24:24.764
Or is it during dinner?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.633
Do I sort of just
launch myself at him?

24:26.666 --> 24:27.834
There should be no launching.

24:27.867 --> 24:28.901
Um, you need a plan.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.670
What's he making?

24:30.703 --> 24:31.738
Lasagna.

24:31.771 --> 24:32.939
Fine, here's
what you do.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.874
Watch him prepare it.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.876
Keep the mood
light and sexy,

24:36.909 --> 24:38.811
and tell him how good
everything smells.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.680
Oh, right, so I'm-I'm
talking about the food,

24:40.713 --> 24:42.014
but I'm talking about him.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.584
Yep. And then,
once he puts it in the oven,

24:44.617 --> 24:45.918
(snaps fingers)
it's go-time.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.521
That way, you have
45, maybe 50 minutes,

24:48.555 --> 24:50.256
and no one's bloated
from eating.
Ah!

24:50.289 --> 24:52.124
Perfect!
A.B., you are a genius.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.160
I just want
this night to be so...

24:54.193 --> 24:56.028
(sneezes)

24:56.062 --> 24:57.029
(shrieks)

24:57.063 --> 24:58.565
Oh, my God.

24:58.598 --> 24:59.866
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.

24:59.899 --> 25:00.967
I cannot be getting sick.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.669
Not tonight, not tonight.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.870
I'm sure it's just

25:03.903 --> 25:05.605
a sneeze of anticipation.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.773
Okay, I have to go home,

25:06.806 --> 25:07.974
steam my head.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.909
Tonight is happening.

25:09.942 --> 25:10.910
Just have fun.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.945
It'll all be great.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.685
Mayor Hayes.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.887
Lavon, what are you
doing here?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.054
I brought some soup
for AnnaBeth.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.055
I heard she's sick.

25:23.089 --> 25:23.990
What?! You're sick?!

25:24.023 --> 25:25.024
No!

25:25.057 --> 25:26.593
I mean, yes, but...

25:26.626 --> 25:27.694
LEMON:
Not another word.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.195
Tonight is too important.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.763
I'm holding my breath now.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.131
(inhales)

25:33.900 --> 25:35.602
What's so important
about tonight?

25:35.635 --> 25:38.605
It's, uh, Jupiter's closest pass
to the earth in years.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.139
She's excited.

25:40.172 --> 25:44.844
Okay, so due to the flu, we have
lost all of our baton twirlers,

25:44.877 --> 25:46.212
uh, most of our dancers,

25:46.245 --> 25:49.048
and, uh, the human pyramid
is now down to two,

25:49.081 --> 25:50.883
which makes it
more of a human pole.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.284
How am I supposed
to make a commercial

25:52.318 --> 25:54.987
about the people of BlueBell
without any people?

25:55.021 --> 25:57.256
(sighs)

25:57.289 --> 25:58.991
I blew it, man.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.327
Promised Lavon that I would have

26:01.360 --> 26:02.895
a commercial that was
better than Fillmore's,

26:02.929 --> 26:05.632
and I... I have nothing.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.333
Not nothing.
You got me

26:07.366 --> 26:10.803
and, uh, Ch-Charlie
over there.

26:10.837 --> 26:12.004
Who?

26:12.038 --> 26:14.206
Oh, no.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.843
Was this a prop pie, too?

26:16.876 --> 26:18.277
I couldn't
help myself.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.980
It is too good.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.850
That's it.

26:23.883 --> 26:24.917
That's it, Tom.

26:24.951 --> 26:25.885
You're a genius.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.387
Yeah? I got this idea
for a Web series, too...

26:28.420 --> 26:30.957
Not now.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.233
(sneezes)

26:41.267 --> 26:43.736
(coughs):
Oh, God.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.038
(sighs)

26:46.072 --> 26:49.175
(doorbell rings)

26:49.208 --> 26:51.210
(whimpering softly)

26:57.850 --> 26:59.852
(sighs)

27:06.926 --> 27:08.360
(giggles)

27:08.394 --> 27:10.930
Look at you,
right on time.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.732
I didn't want
to waste a minute.

27:12.765 --> 27:13.933
Aw.

27:13.966 --> 27:14.967
(muffled sneeze)

27:15.001 --> 27:15.968
(giggles)

27:16.002 --> 27:17.103
You okay?
Oh, yeah.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.105
I'm just excited
that you're here.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.140
(both chuckle)

27:23.976 --> 27:25.011
(sighs)

27:30.950 --> 27:32.785
Hello?

27:32.819 --> 27:35.054
Is anyone here?

27:35.087 --> 27:36.055
Rose!

27:36.088 --> 27:37.757
You made it!

27:37.790 --> 27:39.158
And I brought
chocolate pretzels.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.293
So, where is
everybody?

27:41.327 --> 27:42.394
What do you mean?

27:42.428 --> 27:43.262
There's more people
coming, right?

27:46.465 --> 27:49.101
Everyone else is sick
with the stupid flu,

27:49.135 --> 27:50.436
and no one else is coming.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.104
Okay?
It's just you and me.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.740
Happy?

27:53.773 --> 27:56.108
Maybe I should go.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.109
No, no.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.945
You're not going anywhere.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.781
This is the first time
I get the house to myself,

28:01.814 --> 28:03.415
and there will be a party.

28:05.785 --> 28:06.753
(thermometer beeps)

28:06.786 --> 28:08.087
103 degrees.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.355
(groans):
Oh.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.424
Son of a big fat
sweaty hog butt!

28:12.458 --> 28:14.393
I'm sorry.

28:14.426 --> 28:15.928
I didn't mean to swear.

28:15.962 --> 28:18.064
I'm not sure that you did.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.899
(sneezes)
Bless you.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.835
Stupid Tom!

28:22.869 --> 28:24.971
It's all his fault.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.406
He says we have to kiss
three times a day.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.408
I told him
not during flu season.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.943
Well, I think that's sweet.

28:30.977 --> 28:32.411
I'd kiss my boyfriend
three times a day

28:32.444 --> 28:34.080
if I knew where the hell he was.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.081
What do you mean?

28:35.114 --> 28:37.049
Wade's right here in town.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.918
I saw him last night
in town square.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.453
Are you sure it was Wade?

28:41.487 --> 28:45.357
Unless he has a twin who also
owns a goofy-looking red hoodie.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.026
(coughs)

28:47.059 --> 28:48.861
(groans)

28:51.864 --> 28:53.933
Wade?

28:53.966 --> 28:55.467
Open up, quarantine-breaker!

28:55.501 --> 28:57.069
I know you're in there!

28:58.971 --> 29:00.472
Come on, open the stupid door!

29:00.506 --> 29:02.541
(Wade coughing)

29:02.574 --> 29:04.510
Wade!

29:18.891 --> 29:20.893
Oh, God.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.564
Oh, you're burning up.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.565
(sighs)

29:26.598 --> 29:29.001
Zoe? Zoe?

29:29.035 --> 29:31.037
Did you just
break my window?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.882
ZOE:
Just take a sip.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.050
You have to
drink something.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.985
I'm fine, and I don't.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.486
If only there were an actual
doctor here who knew better.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.088
If I take a sip, will you just

29:49.121 --> 29:50.589
bring the volume
down a little bit?

29:50.622 --> 29:51.790
So, Lily Anne made

29:51.824 --> 29:54.393
a pass at you, and you bailed,
you snuck back into town.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.295
I'm not happy about it,
but I get it.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.264
I did say the thing
about the volume, right?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.900
What I don't get is how
you were here, like this,

30:00.933 --> 30:02.902
the whole time I was
leaving you those messages.

30:02.935 --> 30:05.071
Yeah.
So you'd rather
let me think

30:05.104 --> 30:05.972
that you had
an affair

30:06.005 --> 30:08.174
than admit to breaking
the quarantine?

30:08.207 --> 30:09.241
Have some toast.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.309
Who does that?

30:10.342 --> 30:11.844
I'm talking to you!

30:11.878 --> 30:13.412
It's not just about
the quarantine

30:13.445 --> 30:16.115
or that I maybe almost got
the whole town sick.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.549
Not maybe, you did.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.051
It's about this, okay?

30:19.085 --> 30:23.022
The-the tea and the toast
and the wet washcloth.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.223
All of it.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.624
I didn't call you back
when I was sick

30:25.657 --> 30:27.159
'cause I didn't want you
trying to take care of me.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.594
Well, what's
wrong with that?

30:28.627 --> 30:30.362
What's wrong with it is I don't
want to be taken care of.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.865
What?
By you or anyone else.

30:32.899 --> 30:33.900
When I'm sick,
I just want to be

30:33.933 --> 30:36.435
left alone, and I knew
you'd be incapable of that.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.070
I can take care of myself,
all right?

30:38.104 --> 30:39.906
I been doing it
since I was ten years old.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.976
Fine.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.044
You want to take
care of yourself?

30:45.077 --> 30:46.045
Go for it.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.080
You keep up
the good work.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.356
(giggles)

30:57.389 --> 30:59.191
I don't think my
kitchen has ever

30:59.225 --> 31:01.360
smelled so
heavenly before.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.229
What is that I smell?

31:03.262 --> 31:07.133
Is that parsley
and oregano...

31:09.535 --> 31:11.237
Is that Sicilian
clementine?

31:11.270 --> 31:13.105
Spot-on!
(laughs)

31:13.139 --> 31:15.441
Well, the Sicilian clementine,
that's-that's all me.

31:15.474 --> 31:16.943
Don't judge,
but I picked a cologne

31:16.976 --> 31:18.510
that went with
what I was making.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.179
I like a man
who plans ahead.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.981
(both laugh)

31:22.014 --> 31:25.084
So, dinner should be
ready in about...

31:25.117 --> 31:26.485
45 minutes.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.487
Well, I have a few
thoughts about

31:28.520 --> 31:29.922
how we can kill
some of that time.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.123
Do you now?
Mm-hmm.

31:31.157 --> 31:32.391
(muffled sneeze)

31:32.424 --> 31:33.425
Bless you.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.061
No, no, no, no, no.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.128
Bless you, silly!

31:36.162 --> 31:39.231
I just wanted to
say that I am so...

31:39.265 --> 31:40.566
(coughs)

31:40.599 --> 31:42.468
...excited
(chuckles)

31:42.501 --> 31:43.669
about dinner.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.072
So, um, why don't
you just go sit down.

31:46.105 --> 31:49.976
Go make yourself comfortable,
and I'll be right back.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.982
(chuckles)

32:04.056 --> 32:06.993
Lavon, this is delicious.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.361
It tastes just as good
as it smells.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.363
Seems like it's
doing the trick.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.333
You sound
better already.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.434
Oh, no, you shouldn't.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.469
I'm super contagious.

32:17.503 --> 32:18.670
Runs in my family.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.106
It's okay, I got
the flu shot.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.108
Oh, uh, still.

32:22.141 --> 32:25.544
I wouldn't want
to take any chances.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.380
(chuckles softly)

32:28.414 --> 32:29.681
You should go.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.519
You sure?

32:36.022 --> 32:38.290
O-Okay.

32:38.324 --> 32:41.660
I'll just, uh, leave the
rest of the care package.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.696
Lavon...

32:44.730 --> 32:46.198
all this for me?

32:46.232 --> 32:47.566
Well, yeah.

32:49.068 --> 32:52.004
And, uh, for the town.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.507
Because the town needs
you to do the commercial.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.309
Right.
The commercial.
Yeah.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.778
You know, whenever I
had to stay home sick,

32:59.811 --> 33:02.414
my mama would
give me soup

33:02.448 --> 33:06.218
and, uh, read to me
from Sports Illustrated.

33:06.252 --> 33:07.253
(chuckles)

33:07.286 --> 33:10.589
Well...

33:10.622 --> 33:13.159
Got the "Spring
Planting" issue.

33:15.461 --> 33:19.065
I do have some questions
about my heirloom tomatoes. Hmm.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.505
All right.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.811
(giggles)

33:32.844 --> 33:35.481
I'm sorry to have, uh,

33:35.514 --> 33:37.116
kept you waiting.

33:37.149 --> 33:40.152
Oh, Lemon, you are
worth waiting for.

33:40.186 --> 33:44.123
You always have the right thing
to say, don't you?

33:47.293 --> 33:49.161
I think I'm about
out of words.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.097
(sneezes)

33:51.130 --> 33:52.798
Oh!
Hey, easy.
You all right?

33:52.831 --> 33:54.600
(laughs)
You seem a
little dizzy.

33:54.633 --> 34:00.739
Uh, maybe... that is because
you are... near.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.274
Why don't you

34:02.308 --> 34:04.676
go get me a glass of wine,

34:04.710 --> 34:07.113
and I will just
sit right here,

34:07.146 --> 34:10.516
and I will wait
for your safe return.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.516
Whoa!
Hey, easy!

34:11.550 --> 34:12.717
(sighs):
Huh. Oh.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.219
Hey, easy.
You all right?

34:14.253 --> 34:15.554
Yeah, it's like...

34:15.587 --> 34:16.788
It's like Disneyland in here.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.790
Lemon, your face
is burning up.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.659
Also because you're near?

34:20.692 --> 34:22.793
I think you
have the flu.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.164
(crying):
I think so, too.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.165
Hey, why are
you crying?

34:26.197 --> 34:28.134
Because I ruined our big night.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.835
No, it's not
ruined. It's just...

34:29.868 --> 34:31.237
postponed.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.404
(sneezes)

34:32.438 --> 34:34.106
Oh, God.
(sniffles)

34:34.139 --> 34:35.373
(sighs)

34:35.407 --> 34:36.875
I understand if you want to go.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.811
This isn't much
of a farewell party at all.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.813
Lemon...

34:41.847 --> 34:43.549
I'm not going anywhere.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.518
I got lasagna
in the oven.

34:46.552 --> 34:47.853
(laughs)

34:47.886 --> 34:49.521
Okay?

34:49.554 --> 34:51.790
(laughs)

34:51.822 --> 34:54.126
It's gonna
be all right.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.793
(groans)

34:57.596 --> 34:59.198
Sheesh.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.866
Don't mind me,

35:00.899 --> 35:02.734
sick guy sleeping here.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.536
Don't worry. I'm not gonna bring
soup to you.

35:04.570 --> 35:05.704
You can crawl over to it.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.239
Yeah, maybe I will.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.241
You know why I left you
all those messages?

35:09.275 --> 35:10.476
Not because

35:10.509 --> 35:12.411
I was worried
about crazy Lily Anne,

35:12.444 --> 35:13.712
but because I missed you.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.714
You weren't worried
even a little bit?

35:15.747 --> 35:16.715
We are stupid and wrong.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.184
About what?

35:18.217 --> 35:19.151
About us.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.919
This relationship.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.689
We're supposed to be there
for each other all of the time.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.324
That's the point
of this whole thing.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.259
If you're having a
concert, I should be there.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.427
I am with the band.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.896
Apology accepted.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.864
And if you're sick,
you should call your girlfriend,

35:32.898 --> 35:35.801
who also happens
to be a doctor,

35:35.834 --> 35:37.336
because in her
professional opinion,

35:37.369 --> 35:39.271
you are terrible
at taking care of yourself.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.840
How bad could I be?
I'm still alive, ain't I?

35:41.873 --> 35:44.543
There are turtles that live
to be 130 years old.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.811
Doesn't make 'em geniuses.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.314
Just means that they haven't
been run over yet.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.815
Zoe, I told you, I'm...

35:49.848 --> 35:52.284
I know. You can take
care of yourself.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.819
Guess what, dum-dum.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.321
You're doing it wrong.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.788
Now that you have me,

35:56.822 --> 35:58.924
you're supposed to let
me take care of you.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.260
That's how you take care
of yourself. Get it?

36:01.293 --> 36:03.229
(phone ringing)

36:03.262 --> 36:04.796
What kind is it?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.865
Chicken noodle.
Hey, Rose. What's up?

36:06.898 --> 36:07.833
Ugh!

36:07.866 --> 36:09.801
Magnolia is sick as a dog,

36:09.835 --> 36:11.337
and she won't
let me leave!

36:11.370 --> 36:12.404
Okay, I'll be right over.

36:12.438 --> 36:13.639
Please hurry.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.906
It's like a Stephen King story
over here.

36:14.940 --> 36:15.574
(sneezes)

36:15.607 --> 36:18.277
"And when
choosing a lawn,

36:18.310 --> 36:21.380
remember, deer never
eat ornamental grass."

36:21.413 --> 36:24.350
I do believe I found
my new daily affirmation.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.751
(both chuckle)

36:25.784 --> 36:27.819
(coughs)
Oh.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.256
Uh, can I get you some
more soup? Oh, okay.

36:30.289 --> 36:33.492
Or we could dive
right into, uh,

36:33.525 --> 36:35.394
"Guide for Planting
Collard Greens."

36:35.427 --> 36:38.964
Huh. It is the
cousin of kale.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.199
Who knew?

36:43.001 --> 36:44.570
You're really something,
you know that?

36:44.603 --> 36:47.639
I didn't know
the mayor made house calls.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.341
It's no big deal.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.842
I'm here to serve.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.345
I bet you say that
to all your constituents.

36:53.379 --> 36:54.980
Well, not all of 'em.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.989
No, no, no, no, no, we...

37:04.022 --> 37:05.357
we... we can't do this.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.327
No. Oh, you're right.
We-we... we can't.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.596
Why not?

37:10.629 --> 37:12.598
I'm very sick, so...

37:12.631 --> 37:14.466
you should go.

37:14.500 --> 37:18.304
Thank you for the magazines
and the soup.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.773
But please go.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.618
I hope you
feel better.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.957
(door closes)

37:47.366 --> 37:50.469
Okay, uh, it's a little bit
of a different direction,

37:50.502 --> 37:53.038
but I... I think
you're gonna like it.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.442
(clears throat)

37:56.475 --> 37:58.477
*

38:08.887 --> 38:10.822
Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.824
It's just too good!

38:12.858 --> 38:14.960
MAN: It's strawberry season
 in BlueBell.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.795
Don't miss out.
 It's yours for the picking.

38:16.828 --> 38:17.929
(bell dings)

38:17.963 --> 38:19.931
(chuckles)
All right.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.733
Take that, Fillmore!

38:21.767 --> 38:22.734
(laughs)
Yeah! All right.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.904
You know, I got half a mind
to put you in charge

38:25.937 --> 38:27.706
of all BlueBell tourism
from now on.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.975
(chuckles) I-I appreciate that,
Lavon, but you know what?

38:30.008 --> 38:31.377
I think it's
probably time

38:31.410 --> 38:33.579
for me to go back
to being a lawyer.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.814
Well, the town thanks you,
and so do I.

38:35.847 --> 38:36.848
(sighs)
(chuckles)

38:36.882 --> 38:38.384
And, uh,

38:38.417 --> 38:40.586
George, for what it's worth, um,

38:40.619 --> 38:44.022
you were right...
about the soup.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.825
Sometimes it's not just soup.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.860
Tell you this much, in
case you were wondering,

38:48.894 --> 38:50.562
there's some real
chemistry there.

38:50.596 --> 38:52.598
Camera doesn't lie.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.837
Knock-knock.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.372
Lemon, are you, uh...?

39:00.406 --> 39:01.473
Over here.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.942
Oh, sweetie!

39:03.975 --> 39:05.944
The flu?

39:05.977 --> 39:06.978
(chuckles)

39:07.012 --> 39:08.547
It looks worse than it is.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.048
Uh, not really.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.852
But fortunately, I
have been in the care

39:13.885 --> 39:17.623
of Dr. Walt Blodgett,
D.D.S. all night.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.658
She's got
really good insurance.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.593
And a really sweet boyfriend.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.562
(Walt and Lemon chuckle)

39:23.595 --> 39:27.399
Yeah, I just, uh, popped by to,
you know, check in...

39:27.433 --> 39:29.568
It's okay, A.B., I know
you came to apologize.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.970
What?
For getting me sick.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.104
It's okay.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.706
I mean, these things happen.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.907
I mean, we can't go around

39:35.941 --> 39:36.908
through life holding

39:36.942 --> 39:38.143
our breath, can we?

39:38.176 --> 39:39.545
No, we can't.

39:39.578 --> 39:40.879
I can barely do it at all.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.814
That's why I don't
go scuba diving.

39:42.848 --> 39:43.882
(laughs)

39:43.915 --> 39:44.883
(Walt and Lemon laugh)

39:44.916 --> 39:47.953
Well, I should get going.

39:48.987 --> 39:49.955
Uh, but if you need anything...

39:49.988 --> 39:52.991
Oh, I think I got everything
I need right here.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.627
But thank you, A.B.

39:55.661 --> 39:56.928
You're the best.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.938
Your fever broke.
You're gonna live.

40:06.972 --> 40:09.775
I had the weirdest
hallucinations.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.142
I dreamt that I was
friends with Rose.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.445
Hilarious. Remind me to
never save your life again.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.781
Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

40:17.082 --> 40:19.084
Really?
No one else is warm?

40:21.152 --> 40:22.153
(knocking)

40:23.955 --> 40:26.825
I-I... I just
came by to return this

40:26.858 --> 40:28.994
and to thank you
for everything.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.862
You're welcome.
And to tell you

40:30.896 --> 40:33.064
that last night
was a mistake.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.467
It can't happen again.
I agree 100%.

40:35.501 --> 40:38.504
Just so we're clear, what
part are we talking about?

40:38.537 --> 40:41.006
The part where I
brought you soup?

40:41.039 --> 40:42.474
No.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.175
The part where I
read the, uh, article

40:44.209 --> 40:45.744
about organic
mulch to you?

40:45.777 --> 40:47.212
No.
Okay.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.481
Well, I guess we're
talking about the part

40:49.515 --> 40:51.617
where we almost
did this.

40:53.819 --> 40:56.955
*

41:08.199 --> 41:11.837
WADE:
Welcome back, Doc.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.672
(sighs)

41:13.705 --> 41:16.575
Guess who's got the flu.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.644
What time is it?

41:18.677 --> 41:19.811
I have patients.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.212
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy there, Sparky.

41:21.246 --> 41:22.748
You're not going anywhere.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.516
Whole town's on the mend.

41:24.550 --> 41:25.884
I can't just stay here.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.819
You can, and you will.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.855
Spending the day in bed;
I'm taking care of you.

41:29.888 --> 41:30.956
You're taking care of me?

41:30.989 --> 41:32.724
Yeah. It's how
this works, right?

41:32.758 --> 41:35.126
You take care of me,
I take care of you.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.695
I think I heard that somewhere.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.830
(whispers):
Yeah.

41:38.864 --> 41:41.099
Hey, I, uh...
I brought you some soup.

41:41.132 --> 41:42.668
I'm not hungry.

41:42.701 --> 41:45.003
Got to have a little bit.
Not open to discussion.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.538
Come on.
No, Wade, I can't.

41:46.572 --> 41:48.006
I can feed you
intravenously if I have to.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.708
I watched a YouTube video.
I can get it done.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.209
Fine.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.644
All right.

41:52.678 --> 41:53.945
Do you have crackers?
Of course I do.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.914
All right, now,
I don't have as many as I had.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.584
I got hungry waiting for you
to wake up, so I snacked a bit.

41:58.617 --> 41:59.851
But, uh, you'll get
your crackers...
