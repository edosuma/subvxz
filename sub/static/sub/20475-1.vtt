09:23.813 --> 09:25.565
[Gabe] <i>You think you're so slick.</i>

09:25.648 --> 09:26.566
Okay, no, no, no, no.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.859
-No, no.
-What? What?

09:27.942 --> 09:29.360
Stop, you're gonna mess up my hair.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.820
-Huh?
-Like, more.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.072
Yeah, I am.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.490
I'm gonna mess up that hair

09:33.573 --> 09:35.325
like a light drizzle
on a much too humid day.

09:36.743 --> 09:40.038
-[phone buzzing]
-[laughing]

09:40.121 --> 09:42.123
[clears throat] Reggie wants you.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.130
[groans] Shit.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.843
I'm supposed to represent
for the BSU at this caucus.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.844
Mm.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.304
[Sam] Oh.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.225
Reggie's a...

10:00.308 --> 10:01.518
Reggie's a cool guy.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.980
Yeah, except for when he corners you

10:06.064 --> 10:07.774
with a "'Sup?"

10:07.857 --> 10:09.609
Or a "So..."

10:09.692 --> 10:10.902
Ellipses implied.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.946
You guys gonna talk about the party?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.239
What else?

10:14.989 --> 10:16.449
Man, it's just so fucked.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.161
You know I could, uh--

10:20.245 --> 10:21.955
I could come with.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.039
Oh.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.624
No, it's cool.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.167
It's, um...

10:26.251 --> 10:27.627
It's members only.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.423
[clears throat]

10:38.138 --> 10:41.182
So... you're a shark.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.352
-That's cool. I get that.
-[chuckles]

10:44.435 --> 10:45.937
You know, you're always moving,

10:46.020 --> 10:47.147
and you only slow down to kill...

10:47.230 --> 10:49.065
Gabe, I know how analogies work.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.984
[both laugh]

10:51.067 --> 10:53.027
I guess what I'm saying is, you know,
it's, uh...

10:54.779 --> 10:56.823
You know, romance in a place like this,

10:56.906 --> 10:59.200
it's been reduced to, like, hooking up,
you know?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.743
Mm, romance.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.954
[Gabe] It doesn't exist here.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.709
I want to be more than just a hot lay
for you, Sam.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.714
[laughing]

11:12.797 --> 11:13.965
Yeah.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.216
All right.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.468
What CW show are we in?

11:17.552 --> 11:19.679
You know what I'm trying to say.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.224
You want more.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.475
Yeah.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.021
Oh. Um...

11:31.065 --> 11:33.359
I gotta go get a shower.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.861
So...

11:42.619 --> 11:44.370
-Later, gator.
-[chuckles]

11:48.333 --> 11:49.834
[sighs]

11:50.919 --> 11:52.879
[Sam] Lionel Higgins, right?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.297
Um, yes.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.174
From the <i>Winchester Independent.</i>

11:56.257 --> 11:57.842
Covering this meeting.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.552
I just need someone
to give me the lay of the land.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.179
[Sam] Sure.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.389
You did that article
about breaking up the party.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.099
Yeah.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.351
Why haven't we heard of you before?

12:06.434 --> 12:08.519
[Lionel] I'm not that notable.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.188
Something tells me that's not true.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.733
[chattering]

12:13.816 --> 12:16.444
Well, generally speaking,

12:16.527 --> 12:18.655
Black Caucus is when
the different black student unions

12:18.738 --> 12:21.616
at Winchester get together
for a completely masturbatory

12:21.699 --> 12:24.702
and pointless pissing contest
under the guise of unity.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.497
Held during lunchtime
at Armstrong Parker once a month

12:27.580 --> 12:30.416
because nobody wants
to make room on their schedule.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.544
-And we already eat here.
-Is this off the record?

12:33.628 --> 12:35.046
[Sam] You can quote us all you want.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.507
We got the Black Student Union,
headed by me,

12:37.590 --> 12:40.009
Winchester's first and only relevant group

12:40.093 --> 12:41.636
fighting for black causes on campus.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.680
We got the African-American Student Union,

12:43.763 --> 12:47.266
or AASU, which basically does nothing

12:47.350 --> 12:49.560
and takes credit for the work of the BSU.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.020
They claim mac and cheese Wednesdays,

12:51.104 --> 12:52.522
but we made that shit happen.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.523
Yes.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.567
We got Black American Forum
or Black AF.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.444
Mostly mediocre slam poets.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.446
They make hashtags and T-shirts.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.490
-And throw dope parties.
-Mm-hmm.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.866
-And then there's--
-[Troy] CORE.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.868
The Coalition of Racial Equality.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.830
And the only group here invited to sit

13:08.913 --> 13:10.790
at the dean's quarterly student council.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.084
Don't say "the dean"
like he's not your father.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.169
-Hi, Lionel.
-Hi, Troy.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.380
I trust your story's portrayal
of these fine groups

13:17.463 --> 13:18.631
will go unbiased.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.925
-You got it, Troy.
-[chuckles]

13:21.009 --> 13:22.301
Some things never change.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.553
Some things do.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.263
Coco.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.848
CORE's new treasurer.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.224
Real name: Colandrea.

13:28.307 --> 13:32.437
C-o-l-a-n-d-r-e-a.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.896
For accuracy.

13:33.980 --> 13:38.109
Don't do it with that mess atop your head
you like to pass off as natural,

13:38.192 --> 13:40.319
held together by bobby pins and prayer?

13:40.403 --> 13:41.863
-Lord.
-You want to go there?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.531
With half of India's GDP atop your head?

13:43.614 --> 13:44.949
-Oh.
-They kinda got beef.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.702
-Picked that up.
-We have nothing, sweets.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.120
I happen to find her viewpoints

13:49.203 --> 13:50.621
to be little more than self-serving,

13:50.705 --> 13:52.540
blacker-than-thou propaganda.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.042
Feel free to quote me, Lionel.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.753
Yo, fam, can we cut
the <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> auditions

13:56.836 --> 13:57.754
and get to it?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.213
[man] Post-racial my ass.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.631
Everyone said we were crying wolf,

14:00.715 --> 14:02.091
but this is our proof.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.218
A bunch of white kids dressing up like us?

14:04.302 --> 14:06.262
I mean, this is some real shit.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.347
Yeah, guys, you know what this is?

14:08.431 --> 14:10.975
-This is racism.
-What a revelation, Kelsey.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.436
Somebody should write this down.
Paper boy, you got that?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.104
[Kelsey] I thought this kind of thing

14:15.188 --> 14:18.024
only happened in the '50s
or in BuzzFeed articles.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.275
I don't feel safe.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.027
I'd like to use this meeting

14:21.110 --> 14:25.239
to cull some thoughts that CORE
can actually take to the dean.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.866
What the hell's the Coalish gonna do?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.743
Y'all should let the BSU take lead

14:28.826 --> 14:31.037
because we've been fighting these issues
since jump.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.872
[man] We need a march on campus, fam.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.124
-#Sinchester.
-[man] Uh-huh.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.752
-#BlackFarceParty.
-[woman] Yeah, yeah.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.088
-#FuckThePolice!
-[man] Uh-huh.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.048
-[woman] Yeah.
-That one's evergreen.

14:42.131 --> 14:47.512
Damn straight. These kids amuse themselves
by wearing black bodies as costumes,

14:47.595 --> 14:49.097
and we're the only ones upset?

14:49.180 --> 14:51.265
We got to bust this campus wide open.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.142
[woman] Yes, Brother Malcolm.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.269
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-sa, ma-ma-ku-sa.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.771
Just to play devs,

14:56.854 --> 14:58.606
all my white friends are talking about it.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.400
-So all your friends?
-[Kelsey] Yelling at people

15:00.483 --> 15:02.985
who are already on our side
using hashtags and marches?

15:03.069 --> 15:03.986
[cell phone buzzes]

15:04.070 --> 15:05.488
Cathartic though it may be,

15:05.571 --> 15:06.864
it just makes us look angry.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.282
We are angry, Kelsey.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.243
So the AASU proposes we do nothing.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.661
[Troy] That's not what she said.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.955
[Kelsey] <i>Pastiche</i> are the bad guys.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.957
-Let's go after them.
-[Sam] For what?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.834
-Their editor is Kurt Fletcher.
-[cell phones buzzing]

15:17.917 --> 15:19.001
Son of the president.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.629
Nothing is going to happen to him
or <i>Pastiche.</i>

15:21.712 --> 15:23.089
You know, in the real world,

15:23.172 --> 15:26.259
kids are getting shot by cops
for being black.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.302
Voter rights are still being suppressed.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.096
Our criminal justice system

15:30.179 --> 15:31.973
continues to propagate a new Jim Crow.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.308
This isn't about a college magazine.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.352
This is about a movement.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.689
We're surrounded by the future leaders
of this country,

15:39.772 --> 15:41.732
and we finally got their ear.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.527
-So what do we want to say?
-About what now?

15:46.195 --> 15:48.030
You just got tagged on this.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.380
Miss Black Power over here
dating white boys.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.383
[chattering]

16:19.395 --> 16:21.814
[sighs]

16:24.817 --> 16:26.527
So...

16:27.153 --> 16:28.321
what y'all talking 'bout?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.656
Pussy.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.908
Bitches.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.242
Sam, I was saying nothing,

16:33.326 --> 16:34.660
because it is none of my business

16:34.744 --> 16:36.120
what goes on behind your sheets.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.206
It's "between your sheets," Rashid.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.541
[Rashid] I speak five languages.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.044
You speak one, barely.
Do not correct my English.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.921
[man mockingly]
"Do not correct my English."

16:45.004 --> 16:46.047
[Kelsey] Sam...

16:46.923 --> 16:49.509
I'm happy if you're happy.

16:49.592 --> 16:50.843
Okay?

16:57.642 --> 16:58.809
[Sam] What?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.021
Nothing.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.321
Talking shit behind my back?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.114
You're fucking someone behind mine.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.535
He's my TA from doc class.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.328
We went for drinks once over the summer,

17:17.411 --> 17:19.455
and you know there ain't shit to do
over the summer.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.748
You know what?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.334
I'm happy for you, Sam.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.253
Don't do that, Jo. Not you.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.046
I have to unpack my best friend

17:27.129 --> 17:28.673
having a secret bae.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.049
Secret or white?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.759
Both.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.636
You know I'm biracial, so technically--

17:33.719 --> 17:34.929
Look, don't.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.222
You're not Rashida Jones biracial.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.723
You're Tracee Ellis Ross biracial.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.141
People think of you as black.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.102
[sighs] This is why I didn't say shit.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.104
No, you didn't say shit
because you stay talking

17:43.187 --> 17:44.730
about how we can't give up on our men.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.315
Sam, we met in the comments section

17:46.399 --> 17:47.858
of that <i>Medium </i>article you wrote.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.610
"Don't Fall in Love with Your Oppressor:

17:49.694 --> 17:52.029
A Black Girl's Guide
to Love at Winchester."

17:52.113 --> 17:53.573
That one got so many likes.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.993
What's crazy is you got guys like Reggie
wanting to drink your bathwater.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.869
He's literally Dap from <i>School Daze,</i>
but darker,

17:58.953 --> 18:00.746
and you pass him up for Mackle-less?

18:00.830 --> 18:03.124
I thought I knew who I was.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.834
I thought I knew what I wanted,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.794
but when I'm with him,

18:06.877 --> 18:08.045
I don't know.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.338
I... [sighs]

18:11.507 --> 18:13.301
It's like a respite from everything.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.636
We're goofy.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.513
We reference obscure movies.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.806
We watch <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

18:18.889 --> 18:20.349
That shit with dragons set in the world

18:20.433 --> 18:22.268
where no one's black except the slaves?

18:22.351 --> 18:23.644
I've tried to break it off before,

18:23.728 --> 18:25.146
but he sends one text,

18:25.229 --> 18:27.440
and I can't help but smile all day long.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.899
You hate smiling.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.154
[laughs]

18:33.237 --> 18:34.405
[sighs]

18:34.488 --> 18:36.449
[groans]

18:36.532 --> 18:37.867
So this is a thing?

18:42.622 --> 18:44.749
Yeah, this is a thing.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.672
[Joelle laughs]

18:51.756 --> 18:53.132
He looks like the white dude

18:53.215 --> 18:54.550
in the picture that comes with the frame.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.510
[both laughing]

18:56.594 --> 18:58.054
He does.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.472
[phone chimes]

19:01.599 --> 19:03.392
Fuck.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.278

20:37.361 --> 20:38.988
But, you know, uh, in my defense,

20:39.071 --> 20:42.116
the use of "bae" was purely ironic.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.453
You didn't think to ask

20:45.536 --> 20:46.996

Uh...

20:49.123 --> 20:50.499
Um, I'm sorry.

We're gonna watch a TV show.

A little.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.826
Oh, so in this instance,
you want me to appropriate your culture.

No, I--

But yours do.

29:39.361 --> 29:42.406
When you mock or belittle us,

29:42.489 --> 29:44.741
you enforce an existing system.

29:46.660 --> 29:49.121
Cops everywhere
staring down the barrel of a gun

29:49.204 --> 29:50.539
at a black man

29:50.622 --> 29:53.417
don't see a human being.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.877
They see a caricature...

29:55.961 --> 29:57.504
a thug...

29:57.587 --> 29:58.547
a nigger.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.008
A nigger. A nigger.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.885
So... nah!

30:03.969 --> 30:05.304
You don't get to show up

30:05.387 --> 30:08.015
in a Halloween costume version of us

30:08.098 --> 30:11.184
and claim irony or ignorance,

30:11.268 --> 30:12.686
not anymore.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.066
Before this party...

30:18.775 --> 30:20.527
a POC on this campus

30:20.610 --> 30:22.946
couldn't even think the word "racism"

30:23.030 --> 30:26.199
without being accused of crying wolf.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.784
But just like it took

30:28.702 --> 30:30.412
a Sandra Bland,

30:31.288 --> 30:33.290
a Trayvon Martin,

30:33.373 --> 30:35.834
and a Philando Castile

30:35.917 --> 30:37.544
to wake some folks up,

30:38.670 --> 30:40.297
this party is what it took

30:40.380 --> 30:42.341
to wake this campus up.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.428
Look.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.892
I sent the invite.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.561
I wrote it.

30:55.312 --> 30:58.482
Broke into <i>Pastiche's</i> account
and sent it.

30:59.441 --> 31:00.859
It was fascinating to see

31:00.942 --> 31:02.569
what was lurking beneath the surface

31:02.652 --> 31:04.237
when you were given an excuse to suspend

31:04.321 --> 31:07.074
your polite, passive liberalism.

31:07.991 --> 31:11.119
I considered it a sociological experiment.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.579
And guess what.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.040
You proved my point.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.628
Winchester, we got a problem.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.175
Oh, one more thing.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.968
To Gabe Mitchell,

31:27.761 --> 31:29.179
I'm sorry.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.889
Please forgive me.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.393
#HateItWhen bae's mad.
