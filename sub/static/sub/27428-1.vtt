00:23.694 --> 00:25.649
Sequels... they get a bad rap,

00:25.674 --> 00:27.563
but I personally love a sequel.

00:27.598 --> 00:30.900
It's the opportunity to do
things bigger and better.

00:30.935 --> 00:33.102
Wait. Oh...

00:37.941 --> 00:39.340
And no matter what the haters say,

00:39.376 --> 00:42.631
the second time around can be
a lot better than the first.

00:49.153 --> 00:51.753
Good on Meghan. Girl's a princess now.

00:51.789 --> 00:53.721
And as for me, I'm a sophomore,

00:53.757 --> 00:55.623
which means I'm wise enough to recognize

00:55.659 --> 00:59.227
my first year at Cal U was a bit rocky.

00:59.263 --> 01:00.595
I just don't want to break your heart.

01:00.630 --> 01:03.265
It's a little too late for that.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.680
Okay, fine. I was a Bambi...

01:16.705 --> 01:19.469
flawlessly doe-eyed, but totally lost.

01:19.494 --> 01:21.615
This year, though, I came to win.

01:21.650 --> 01:23.442
<i>For one thing, I've got my dude.</i>

01:23.474 --> 01:25.059
Thanks for showing me around
the city, babe.

01:25.087 --> 01:27.387
<i>And now, as they say in Paris,</i>

01:27.412 --> 01:29.553
<i>Le pièce de résistance.</i>

01:32.261 --> 01:34.428
- We're Paris-official now, baby.
- Mm!

01:34.463 --> 01:36.545
We got this on lock.

01:37.633 --> 01:39.999
<i>Yeah, it's been rough that
he's been in Paris all summer,</i>

01:40.035 --> 01:43.769
<i>but in less than 24 hours,
we'd be reunited.</i>

01:43.805 --> 01:45.604
But most importantly,

01:45.640 --> 01:47.234
I've got my girls.

<i>back at it and ready
to take on the new year,</i>

02:33.728 --> 02:36.428

02:42.169 --> 02:43.668

02:43.703 --> 02:45.370
<i>I was absolutely determined</i>

02:45.405 --> 02:47.839
<i>not to have the dreaded sophomore slump,</i>

02:47.874 --> 02:49.707
<i>which meant our sequel had to be</i>

02:49.743 --> 02:51.976
<i>bigger and better than the original.</i>

02:55.249 --> 02:56.914
Um...

03:01.087 --> 03:04.722
Cool, this is what my real
nightmares look like.

03:04.758 --> 03:06.591
Did I say "bigger and better"?

03:06.627 --> 03:10.762
Oh, I meant filthier
and absolutely devastating.

03:10.797 --> 03:12.429
Those international students

03:12.465 --> 03:14.298
must've had one hell of a summer.

03:14.333 --> 03:17.168
Yeah, it feels like a lot of
that hell went down in my room.

03:17.203 --> 03:19.403
- Oh, God.
- Gosh, Zoey.

03:19.438 --> 03:22.874
I busted my ass waitressing

03:31.117 --> 03:33.250
Yeah, your summer
really bums us all out,

03:33.286 --> 03:35.186
but it still was not as bad as mine.

03:35.221 --> 03:37.922
Alex Gershbaum,
the budding orthodontist,

03:37.957 --> 03:39.356
is that you?

03:39.392 --> 03:41.092
And just in time for Shabbat.

03:43.128 --> 03:45.696
Not only do my parents not know I'm bi,

03:45.731 --> 03:47.330
they don't know who I am.

03:47.365 --> 03:49.132
Weren't you gonna come out
to them this summer?

03:49.168 --> 03:50.567
Yes, I was,

03:50.602 --> 03:52.703
but then I realized that
if I blind-sided them,

03:52.738 --> 03:54.204
they'd cut me off,
and I wouldn't be able

03:54.239 --> 03:55.706
to live here with you guys.

03:57.309 --> 03:58.809
Maybe I should call them now.

03:58.844 --> 04:00.043
Hold up. Are you saying

04:00.079 --> 04:01.712
that it's my fault you didn't tell them?

04:01.747 --> 04:03.847
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- This is <i> all</i> all your fault, Zo.

04:03.882 --> 04:06.282
All right. Have to agree
to disagree, but I get it.

04:06.318 --> 04:07.718
I get it. This is a mess,

04:07.753 --> 04:09.019
but we're sophomores now,

04:09.054 --> 04:10.420
and what would have had us

04:10.455 --> 04:13.356
in a ball ugly-crying last year,

04:13.391 --> 04:15.058
we will now handle.

04:18.896 --> 04:20.697
"We"?

04:20.732 --> 04:22.665
<i>- I</i> will now handle.
- Mm.

04:24.703 --> 04:25.901
Like, today right now?

04:25.937 --> 04:27.604
- Yeah.
- Sort of wanted to spend the day

04:27.639 --> 04:30.540
primping for my big romantic
airport-movie-reunion moment

04:30.575 --> 04:32.542
with Luca, but, you know,
if you really, really...

04:32.577 --> 04:34.143
- Go!
- Go!

04:34.178 --> 04:35.678
Fine, fine, fine.

04:35.714 --> 04:36.812
I'll handle it.

04:36.848 --> 04:37.913
Like an adult.

04:37.949 --> 04:39.349
Cool.

04:39.384 --> 04:42.385
Please, please, please, please,
please, please,

04:42.420 --> 04:45.121
I mean, we're just children.

04:45.156 --> 04:47.089
Zoey,

04:47.125 --> 04:51.493
today is my first day as former
Adjunct Professor now...

04:51.528 --> 04:53.295
Dean of Students.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.030
Yeah, you heard that right.

04:55.066 --> 04:56.632
Dean of Students.

04:56.667 --> 04:59.635
I mean, it took me a minute to
get my head around it, too.

04:59.670 --> 05:02.471
This dude cannot stop failing up.

05:02.506 --> 05:03.672
I can't be out here playing favorites

05:03.707 --> 05:04.907
in these streets, girl.

05:04.942 --> 05:06.008
Yeah, I know.

05:06.043 --> 05:07.877
But you are my favorite, so...

05:07.912 --> 05:09.711
- I got you.
- You got me? Thank you!

05:09.747 --> 05:12.815
But not in this particular
habitation situation.

05:12.850 --> 05:14.283
I mean, what I'm trying to say is,

05:14.318 --> 05:16.551
as your godfather,

05:16.587 --> 05:17.920
I am your rock.

05:19.456 --> 05:21.256
You're not my godfather.

05:21.291 --> 05:22.857
Hmm...

05:22.893 --> 05:25.126
Well, you can still lean on me,

05:25.162 --> 05:27.561
but I can never ever support you.

05:30.867 --> 05:33.668
Since I couldn't fix this
on my own, and clearly,

05:33.703 --> 05:36.370
Dean Adjunct Professor
Dr. Charles Telphy

05:36.406 --> 05:39.140
was of no help,
I called in reinforcements,

05:39.176 --> 05:41.542
and disguised it all as a turn-up.

05:41.577 --> 05:43.778
Hello, adulthood.

05:52.755 --> 05:55.722
Last year may not have taught me
who Ruth Bader Ginsburg is...

05:55.757 --> 05:57.624
I'll get there someday...

05:57.659 --> 06:00.127
but it taught me how to pivot,
take a deep breath,

06:00.162 --> 06:01.995
and remember I've got this.

06:05.868 --> 06:07.467
Excuse me. Still got this,

06:07.502 --> 06:09.469
just need to handle something.

06:09.504 --> 06:12.172
Why don't you, uh, hang out a bit?

06:12.208 --> 06:13.841
Paint a wall?

06:20.182 --> 06:22.749
What, you never seen a girl down
on a bag of corn chips before?

06:22.784 --> 06:23.851
No, I just never saw

06:23.886 --> 06:26.286
jalapeño barbecue corn chips before.

06:26.322 --> 06:27.420
I'm all in.

06:27.456 --> 06:28.655
Oh.

06:28.690 --> 06:30.522
Touch these chips,
I'm coming for your eyes.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.558
Coach had us on a strict no-carb diet

06:32.593 --> 06:33.860
this summer for training.

06:33.895 --> 06:35.627
- Respect the binge.
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.396
Okay.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.430
Whoa.

06:41.102 --> 06:42.701
You know you ain't got
to wear all the Gucci

06:42.737 --> 06:44.937
- at the same time, right?
- Oh, but I do, okay?

06:44.973 --> 06:47.006
I need to feel like myself again
after the summer I had.

06:52.247 --> 06:53.712
I need to get my head back in the game

06:53.748 --> 06:55.714
if I want to be able
to keep up with Balty's crew.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.983
Yo, Vivek.

06:57.018 --> 06:58.150
Hey, where the hell you been, man?

07:04.724 --> 07:06.624
Wait, we're cleaning this place up,

07:06.659 --> 07:08.093
and you're bringing drugs into it?

07:08.128 --> 07:09.660
It's just pills, all right?

07:09.696 --> 07:11.029
How do you think your bedroom
is already painted?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.398
How 'bout, "Thank you, Vivek"?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.100
Thank you, Vivek.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.534
Do you, like, only have uppers, or...

07:16.569 --> 07:17.936
You know, it doesn't really matter.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.938
I'll take six of whatever you have.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.876
- Don't even... Yeah.
- Mm.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.414
Hey, you know I want you to feel

07:29.449 --> 07:32.350
comfortable in your own home, so...

07:32.386 --> 07:34.552
I told Vivek to chill out
on the dealing.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.220
I know that it bothers you,

07:36.255 --> 07:38.923
so he's not gonna
be selling here anymore.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.792
Although, to be clear,

07:40.827 --> 07:42.760
I will be using here.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.228
A lot.

07:44.263 --> 07:45.563
Well, thank you, Nomi.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.331
It's really thoughtful of you...

07:47.366 --> 07:48.733
the selling, not the using,

07:48.768 --> 07:51.035
but, you know, baby steps.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.937
Yeah, listen. I'm all about, like,

07:52.972 --> 07:55.473
peaceful living, you know,
giving each other space,

07:55.508 --> 07:58.476
and ultimately respecting
each other's boundaries.

07:58.511 --> 07:59.811
Aww.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.446
Aww, huggy.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.080
Mm.

08:09.221 --> 08:11.922
So, apparently pre-registering
doesn't mean jack

08:11.958 --> 08:14.058
when one of your mandatory
classes is canceled

08:14.093 --> 08:15.792
because your self-righteous professor

08:15.828 --> 08:17.727
thought it was more important
to start a family

08:17.763 --> 08:19.330
than replace her IUD.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.865
Oh, my God. I'm busy!

08:21.900 --> 08:23.533
I hope that dumb baby is worth it.

08:23.569 --> 08:26.570
Oh, my God. What do you want?

08:27.573 --> 08:28.705
Goodness.

08:30.142 --> 08:31.708
Oh, hey.

08:31.743 --> 08:33.677
Hi.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.946
- Hey.
- Um...

08:35.982 --> 08:38.414
We were just going to, uh...

08:38.451 --> 08:39.984
We were just gonna take some shots to...

08:43.154 --> 08:46.723
Wow, I didn't think it would be
this hard to see you.

08:46.758 --> 08:48.658
Um...

08:48.694 --> 08:51.060
You look really good.

08:51.096 --> 08:53.363
Oh, my God. I broke him.

08:53.398 --> 08:55.365
Hey, do you want to,

08:55.400 --> 08:56.800
I don't know, come in and sit down?

08:56.835 --> 08:58.234
We can talk things out.

08:59.571 --> 09:01.170
Ah!

09:01.206 --> 09:02.939
I'm messing with you, freshman.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.375
- Come on.
- Oh, hm.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.043
Ha, ha.

09:07.078 --> 09:08.545
- Sophomore.
- Got to talk it out?

09:08.580 --> 09:10.580
You wanted to talk it out.
You should've seen your face.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.649
- It was so stupid.
- Mm-hmm.

09:12.684 --> 09:14.817
I made the right choice.

09:14.852 --> 09:16.986
Your corny-ass boyfriend must've
been geeked when he saw that.

09:17.022 --> 09:19.455
- What is that, Brie cheese?
- Oh, yeah.

09:19.491 --> 09:22.492
Yeah, it is, and, no,
he is not back yet.

09:22.527 --> 09:25.128
Y-You sure? I thought I saw him
about an hour ago

09:25.163 --> 09:26.862
smoking a cigarette outside of his dorm.

09:26.898 --> 09:28.431
No, that's impossible,

09:28.466 --> 09:29.932
'cause I haven't heard from him.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.667
Well, the guy had on a Balenciaga apron

09:31.702 --> 09:34.437
and culottes, so...

09:34.472 --> 09:36.272
Don't know really who else
that could've been.

09:36.307 --> 09:39.042
Anyway, shots, freshman.
You want me to grab you a...

09:39.077 --> 09:41.411
- Yeah, all right, that sounds good.
- All right, okay.

09:41.446 --> 09:43.046
There is no way my boyfriend,

09:43.081 --> 09:44.713
who I waited three frickin' months for,

09:44.749 --> 09:46.482
is on domestic soil and didn't call me.

09:46.518 --> 09:48.250
Thank you.

09:53.958 --> 09:55.524
Just be cool. Stay classy.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.325
Be cool. Stay classy.

10:01.599 --> 10:03.198
<i>Bonjour,</i> asshole.

10:14.579 --> 10:16.478
Hey, baby.

10:18.515 --> 10:19.848
So, you are here.

10:24.726 --> 10:26.793
<i>There I was, thinking to myself,</i>

10:26.829 --> 10:29.240
<i>"How was it that Luca
texted me from Paris</i>

10:29.274 --> 10:31.341
<i>every night to say 'Sweet dreams'</i>

10:31.366 --> 10:33.532
<i>and every morning to say 'Sup, WYD?'</i>

10:33.567 --> 10:35.129
<i>but now that we're on the same campus,</i>

10:35.154 --> 10:38.337
<i>he didn't even hit me
to say he was back?"</i>

10:38.372 --> 10:40.072
Look, I know what you're thinking.

10:40.108 --> 10:42.975
I was gonna hit you up
when I got in, but...

10:43.011 --> 10:46.445
the flight was mad long,
and I was just mad tired.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.348
And I need to shower and everything.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.951
All right. No, no, no, no.

10:51.986 --> 10:53.285
I-I-I totally get it.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.421
I-It's okay, even though
you only take baths.

10:56.457 --> 10:57.489
It's okay.

10:57.525 --> 10:59.324
- It's cool.
- So you're upset?

10:59.360 --> 11:01.426
No. What'd make you think I'm upset?

11:01.462 --> 11:02.795
I'm good.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.233
I'm glad to see you, honestly.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.603
So, do you want to go back to my place?

11:11.639 --> 11:15.240
I have wine and cheese,

11:15.276 --> 11:17.295
berets, just to name a few things.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.110
- Sounds fire.
- Yeah.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.612
I'm just super tired.

11:22.483 --> 11:23.848
Okay, so...

11:25.486 --> 11:26.985
Just gonna hit me up tomorrow?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.554
What? No, no.

11:28.589 --> 11:31.490
Um, just come in.
We can watch a movie, chill.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.125
I mean, I kind of waited
three months to see you, so...

11:35.729 --> 11:37.329
Okay.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.766
It's looking good, guys, honestly.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.302
I'm seeing a lot of effort.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.103
It's paying off.

11:46.138 --> 11:48.606
Dude, I'm surprised you're not up
in one of those flossy high-rises.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.075
- Where they got you staying?
- In the dorms for now,

11:51.110 --> 11:53.344
but hoping a spot opens up
at Balty's pad, you know?

11:53.379 --> 11:55.580
Wait, so you actually want
to live with those dicks?

11:55.615 --> 11:57.281
Maid service, private chef,

11:57.317 --> 11:58.767
and one of the actors from
"The Maze Runner"?

11:58.807 --> 12:01.085
- Mm.
- Bro, I think I can handle some dicks.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.258
All that Gucci, and still so not Gucci.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.992
I don't understand it.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.661
Whatever, man. Where you living?

12:10.697 --> 12:12.029
You know, got a little spot

12:12.064 --> 12:13.631
in the cut with my people, low-key.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.632
- Still at Hawkins, aren't you?
- And I'm the RA.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.303
Ana, doing shots?

12:20.339 --> 12:21.504
No.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.340
- I'm doing the bottle.
- The whole bottle.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.507
Okay.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.142
Sorry, guys, Balty. Got to go.

12:26.177 --> 12:28.177
Wait, seriously, he calls
and you jump just like that?

12:28.213 --> 12:29.846
What? Dude, he's flying us private

12:29.881 --> 12:31.615
to see Macklemore in Irvine.

12:31.650 --> 12:32.716
You want to go?

12:32.751 --> 12:35.084
- I'm good.
- All right.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.120
Ooh. So, tough summer?

12:37.155 --> 12:38.722
The worst.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.123
- Yours?
- Oh, mine was good.

12:40.158 --> 12:42.626
Spent it serving the community,
speaking up for the culture,

12:42.661 --> 12:45.762
rallying in the streets,
just being a civic hero.

12:45.797 --> 12:47.096
Just a moment. That's all we need.

12:47.132 --> 12:48.732
We can change lives here, people.

12:48.767 --> 12:49.899
Excuse me, sir. Do you have a moment

12:49.934 --> 12:51.767
to join the fight against
juvenile recidivism?

12:51.802 --> 12:53.302
Recidivize these nuts!

12:53.337 --> 12:54.836
Thank you, sir. Have a blessed day.

12:54.872 --> 12:56.272
I mean, we still have
a long way to go with

12:56.307 --> 12:57.773
human decency in this country,

12:57.808 --> 12:59.508
but we'll get there.

12:59.543 --> 13:00.809
Sure.

13:00.844 --> 13:03.011
Unless this country's
incapable of human decency.

13:03.046 --> 13:04.747
- Wait, what's up?
- Huh?

13:04.782 --> 13:07.115
No, I mean, I-I specialize
in conflict resolution.

13:07.151 --> 13:09.050
Also Infant CPR.

13:09.086 --> 13:10.819
Not bragging, just saying.

13:11.889 --> 13:14.088
Fine, look, I-I love Nomi...

13:14.113 --> 13:16.158
- Mm-hmm.
- ...but she keeps doing something

13:16.193 --> 13:18.761
that's making me really uncomfortable.

13:18.796 --> 13:20.896
Serious. Okay. Please go on. Please.

13:20.931 --> 13:23.399
Twice she's come into the bathroom

13:23.434 --> 13:25.257
when I'm in there, and she's...

13:25.282 --> 13:27.349
Got butt-naked. Yeah, she touched you.

13:27.384 --> 13:29.885
Ew! No, she just peed.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.299
- On you? Wow.
- You know what? Forget it.

13:32.324 --> 13:33.650
- I don't know why I talk to you.
- I'm sorry. That was too much.

13:33.675 --> 13:35.190
I went somewhere else.
I'm back. I just...

13:35.225 --> 13:37.225
Look, I'm not trying to minimize
your discomfort, right?

13:37.261 --> 13:38.293
I just think that...

13:38.328 --> 13:39.594
I mean, don't you people usually g...

13:39.629 --> 13:40.828
Grrt! Sorry.

13:40.864 --> 13:42.530
Did you just say "you people"?

13:42.565 --> 13:44.532
Well, no... "You people" as in...

13:44.567 --> 13:46.134
not Mexicans, but, like, women.

13:46.169 --> 13:47.468
Good, 'cause I'm Cuban.

13:48.605 --> 13:50.038
- I knew that.
- Hm.

13:50.073 --> 13:52.908
But don't females usually go
to the bathroom together?

13:52.943 --> 13:55.243
Right? Maybe she just really had to go.

13:57.747 --> 13:59.646
Yeah.

13:59.681 --> 14:01.015
Yeah, we do that.

14:01.050 --> 14:03.284
- Probably just overreacting.
- Maybe.

14:03.319 --> 14:06.053
See? Conflict resolution.

14:06.088 --> 14:07.354
It's what I do.

14:07.390 --> 14:09.390
Also, you ever find
yourself in a sitch...

14:10.492 --> 14:13.093
These two bad boys
to the baby's sternum.

14:13.129 --> 14:15.095
- Gentle pumps. Not too hard.
- No.

14:15.131 --> 14:16.196
- Since it's an infant.
- No.

14:16.232 --> 14:17.631
Cheers.

14:17.666 --> 14:19.366
I'm not chee... Okay.

14:26.175 --> 14:27.908
That was a fun party, huh?

14:27.944 --> 14:29.743
But can you believe how late
some people stayed?

14:29.778 --> 14:31.312
It was... Seriously, it was like,

14:31.347 --> 14:33.480
take a hint when you're not wanted.

14:33.515 --> 14:35.014
Am I right?

14:37.185 --> 14:38.151
Hi!

14:38.186 --> 14:39.419
So...

14:39.455 --> 14:41.354
how'd it go with Luca?

14:41.389 --> 14:42.722
Was it as hot as you thought
it was gonna be?

14:42.758 --> 14:45.291
Spare no detail.
I've had a really dry summer.

14:45.327 --> 14:47.561
Oh, yeah, no, it was good.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.028
It was nice. It was...

14:49.064 --> 14:51.431
- It was very nice and... and good.
- Uh-huh.

14:51.467 --> 14:52.833
Nice and really good.

14:54.302 --> 14:56.035
Wait. Why are...

14:56.071 --> 14:58.972
Why are there no chips?
How can there be no chips?

14:59.942 --> 15:02.041
Like, the twins must've eaten them all?

15:02.077 --> 15:03.743
I mean, they pretty much ate everything.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.044
- Yeah.
- But...

15:05.080 --> 15:07.447
But I thought of nothing else but chips

15:07.482 --> 15:09.148
on my walk back.
I thought of them so much

15:09.184 --> 15:11.117
I could practically taste them,

15:11.152 --> 15:13.386
and for three months...
for <i> three</i> months,

15:13.421 --> 15:14.720
I've dreamt of chips.

15:14.755 --> 15:16.356
I-I-I've Snapchatted chips.

15:16.391 --> 15:18.924
I've FaceTimed chips.
Is it too much to ask

15:18.960 --> 15:20.626
that chips stay awake long enough

15:20.661 --> 15:22.528
to embrace me with... with love

15:22.563 --> 15:23.997
and... and excitement?

15:24.032 --> 15:26.065
Is it? God, is it?!

15:27.168 --> 15:28.167
Oh.

15:29.170 --> 15:30.370
I think you're asking a lot

15:30.405 --> 15:32.238
from the chips there, Zoey.

15:32.273 --> 15:34.374
I don't think it's about the chips.

15:38.035 --> 15:40.510
What happened, Zo? What did chips do?

15:40.535 --> 15:42.902
I went over to Luca's

15:42.927 --> 15:45.161
after our underwhelming reunion,

15:45.186 --> 15:47.685
and he took a shower.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.020
<i>So, I waited</i>

15:49.055 --> 15:52.156
<i>with no candles,
no dill Havarti, no berets,</i>

15:52.192 --> 15:54.692
<i>no cute</i> "Bienvenue <i> home" sign.</i>

15:54.727 --> 15:57.728
<i>Just some dirty laundry
and an overpriced bong</i>

15:57.763 --> 15:59.964
<i>that had been there all summer.</i>

16:07.107 --> 16:08.939
<i>So, there we were.</i>

16:08.975 --> 16:10.808
<i>Finally, I could see him,</i>

16:10.843 --> 16:13.011
<i>touch him, smell him.</i>

16:13.046 --> 16:16.580
<i>Then he smiles at me and says, "So..."</i>

16:16.616 --> 16:19.183
<i>and I say, "So..."</i>

16:19.219 --> 16:21.185
<i>and he says,</i>

16:21.221 --> 16:22.820
<i>"What do you want to do?"</i>

16:22.855 --> 16:25.322
<i>So I say, "What do</i> you <i> want to do?"</i>

16:25.357 --> 16:28.258
<i>and he says "You know
what I want to do,"</i>

16:28.293 --> 16:30.527
<i>So then I say, "I know
what you want to do,</i>

16:30.562 --> 16:32.062
<i>and I want to do it, too."</i>

16:32.097 --> 16:36.033
<i>And I just knew this was the
moment I waited all summer for.</i>

16:39.804 --> 16:41.571
<i>We were finally gonna be together,</i>

16:41.606 --> 16:44.441
<i>in person, no more virtual kisses.</i>

16:50.782 --> 16:51.881
I've been dying for this.

16:51.917 --> 16:53.850
This Paris weed is trash.

16:56.121 --> 16:57.787
Do you have... Do you have a lighter?

16:57.822 --> 16:59.221
This kimono doesn't have pockets.

16:59.257 --> 17:00.957
I don't even...

17:00.992 --> 17:02.158
Excuse me.

17:03.562 --> 17:05.127
Okay, to be fair,

17:05.163 --> 17:06.596
Paris weed does suck.

17:06.631 --> 17:08.897
Look, okay, look. I was mad annoyed,

17:08.934 --> 17:11.133
but I wasn't gonna take it personally.

17:11.169 --> 17:14.336
<i>So, we grabbed a blanket,
moved to the couch,</i>

17:14.372 --> 17:16.973
<i>he started playing
with my hair. You get it.</i>

17:17.008 --> 17:18.540
<i>Aww!</i>

17:18.577 --> 17:21.077
<i>Yeah, but then,</i>

17:21.112 --> 17:22.811
<i>I go, "Can you stop pulling?"</i>

17:22.847 --> 17:25.247
<i>and then he goes,
"You stop pulling, head-ass,"</i>

17:25.282 --> 17:27.215
<i>then I go, "I'm not!"</i>

17:27.251 --> 17:29.151
<i>I told him, "I just paid for this,"</i>

17:29.187 --> 17:31.720
<i>and then he had the</i> nerve <i> to say,</i>

17:31.755 --> 17:33.889
<i>"Maybe you should rock more buns."</i>

17:33.924 --> 17:35.991
<i>Buns aren't flattering to my face!</i>

17:36.026 --> 17:37.726
<i>Get off the wig. What happened?</i>

17:39.029 --> 17:42.164
<i>So, we tried to just
chill and watch a movie.</i>

17:42.200 --> 17:45.301
<i>I figured if anyone could get
us there, Hugh Grant could.</i>

17:45.336 --> 17:47.136
<i>I love you.</i>

17:47.171 --> 17:50.473
<i>Well, come here, then.</i>

17:50.508 --> 17:53.675
<i>And when the music swells
at the end of the movie...</i>

17:58.015 --> 18:00.449
Okay,<i> now</i> you can be pissed.

18:00.485 --> 18:01.550
Please tell me

18:01.586 --> 18:04.453
you smothered his drowsy ass
with a pillow.

18:04.489 --> 18:06.187
Or at least slapped him awake

18:06.223 --> 18:07.807
- and then slapped him back to sleep again.
- At least.

18:07.831 --> 18:08.752
Mm-hmm.

18:09.993 --> 18:12.494
<i>I made sure he had a blanket
so he wasn't cold.</i>

18:14.431 --> 18:16.197
<i>Then I left.</i>

18:18.801 --> 18:21.436
I'm not even angry, guys.
I'm just disappointed

18:21.471 --> 18:24.272
that this big moment that I
wanted to create didn't happen.

18:24.307 --> 18:26.274
I mean, sophomore year
was supposed to be

18:26.309 --> 18:29.043
- my awesome sequel.
- Zoey, life isn't a movie.

18:29.078 --> 18:32.046
You don't figure it out simply
by saying you figured it out.

18:32.081 --> 18:33.914
Okay, but I-I should be winning.

18:33.950 --> 18:35.850
Last year was my year of screwing up...

18:35.885 --> 18:37.318
like, major screwing up.

18:37.354 --> 18:39.086
This year's supposed to be perfect.

18:39.122 --> 18:41.856
Why are you putting that kind
of pressure on yourself?

18:41.891 --> 18:43.557
It's only day one.

18:43.592 --> 18:45.059
If we start at perfect,

18:45.094 --> 18:46.761
we have nowhere else to go but down.

18:46.796 --> 18:48.462
Yeah, I mean, think about
day one last year.

18:48.497 --> 18:50.364
Ana puked all over herself
in a kiddie pool.

18:50.399 --> 18:53.134
And you abandoned me after I puked
all over myself in a kiddie pool.

18:53.169 --> 18:55.836
And I got an STD on my hand
from a rando in a bathroom.

18:55.872 --> 18:58.405
Okay, we all had a horrible
start to freshman year.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.607
- What's your point?
- Well, that <i> is</i> the point.

19:00.643 --> 19:02.309
Freshman year started off crappy,

19:02.344 --> 19:04.611
and for some of us,
with the help of a Z-Pak,

19:04.647 --> 19:05.913
we were able to turn things around

19:05.948 --> 19:07.081
and make something of it.

19:07.116 --> 19:09.950
Yeah, take a look around, Zo.

19:13.188 --> 19:15.324
We turned this dump
into our dream apartment.

19:17.592 --> 19:19.192
Sophomore year's still
young, but I'd say

19:19.227 --> 19:20.459
it's trending in the right direction.

19:20.495 --> 19:23.163
Yeah, and you know what else
is still young, ladies?

19:23.198 --> 19:25.298
The night, and we still got bottles.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.499
- Oh.
- Yeah.

19:26.534 --> 19:28.401
- Oh, for <i> moi?</i>
- Yeah. You need it.

19:30.138 --> 19:32.205
Um, a toast

19:32.240 --> 19:33.773
to not being perfect.

19:33.809 --> 19:36.442
Okay, to making sophomore year

19:36.477 --> 19:38.544
a whole new movie and not a sequel.

19:38.580 --> 19:40.146
To low expectations

19:40.182 --> 19:42.849
and very, very strong antibiotics.

19:42.884 --> 19:44.617
- Cheers. I'll cheers to that.
- Call me during the day.

19:44.652 --> 19:46.051
- Call me during the...
- Just drink.

19:46.087 --> 19:47.186
Just cheers me and drink.

19:47.221 --> 19:48.486
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

19:50.953 --> 19:53.819
<i>The bad thing about having
unrealistic expectations</i>

19:53.844 --> 19:55.990
<i>is having to admit when you're wrong,</i>

19:56.015 --> 19:59.643
but the good thing about embracing
realistic expectations...

20:01.765 --> 20:02.964
...is that you find yourself

20:02.999 --> 20:05.300
more forgiving of other people's faults.

20:07.006 --> 20:10.073
Can we snuggle tonight, Zo?

20:10.109 --> 20:13.076
And it allows the smallest
gestures to blow you away.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.780
I knew Luca wouldn't let me down.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.617
We heard about what happened.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.084
We were going back and forth between

20:21.120 --> 20:23.754
- buffalo and dill flavored...
- But we ultimately decided

20:23.789 --> 20:26.857
this was a classic sour cream
and cheddar moment.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.226
- Get in here, you snacky bitches.
- Okay.

20:32.798 --> 20:35.633
So, things may not be
exactly right with Luca,

20:35.668 --> 20:36.900
but if there's one group

20:36.935 --> 20:38.835
who really does have their shit on lock,

20:38.871 --> 20:40.170
it's my girls.

20:41.606 --> 20:43.774
We 'bout to tear these down.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.242
I've been starving myself.
