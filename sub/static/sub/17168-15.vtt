You're all doing
"it's a surprise" style thing.
I love it!

01:20.181 --> 01:22.214
I'll just step out of the room

something for me that's like,

square with colorful wrapping
and a bow.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.766
Good cover, dude.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.935
Does this crime involve
cake and wrapping paper?

02:16.937 --> 02:19.938
No, there's a herd of
elephants on a murder spree.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.273
Right...

02:21.275 --> 02:23.008
While you take care of
all those elephant-murderers,

Open mine next.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.502
We did not do the forgetting.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.770
Yeah, dude, we knew
it was your birthday.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.171
Then why didn't you
treat me like

03:26.173 --> 03:27.940
I'm the center
of the universe?

03:27.942 --> 03:31.076
Because other people's
birthdays are so boring.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.212
Awkwardly singing
that birthday song.

03:33.214 --> 03:38.050
The eating of the cake
with the spittle and
the candle waxes upon it.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.384
(SHUDDERING)

03:39.386 --> 03:41.353

and pretending to care.

with some dumb trash in it."

03:44.992 --> 03:46.558
It's the worst.

(SHAKILY) I'm sorry
my birthday is such
a bummer for you.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.429
But it's nice to have
one day a year

03:50.431 --> 03:51.897
when all the attention's
on me.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.233
I totally forgot
it was your birthday.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.934
You guys should've told me.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.170

You're the only one
who really cares
about me, Ray-Ray.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.774
-Ow.
-I don't care about you.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.844
There are cosmic consequences
to forgetting
someone's birthday.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.512
-What time is it?
-Almost midnight.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.815
Taking down those
murderous elephants
took all day.

04:09.817 --> 04:13.252
This is bad. We have to
shower him with attention
before the day is over.

04:15.488 --> 04:18.357
Okay, he has cake, presents,
we just need to sing to him.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.825

-But, it's the only way to...
-That song is off limits.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.865
We can't afford it.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.234
We have to pay to sing
the birthday song?

04:29.236 --> 04:31.169
Unfortunately, yes.

04:31.171 --> 04:35.907
Why would they use
such a beloved song
for their own financial gain?

04:35.909 --> 04:38.176
We're running out of time.
Come on, sing.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.112
But there is only one
the birthday song.

-Just make one up.
-Easier said than done.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.616

05:12.513 --> 05:15.147
So, Beast Boy is a baby,
because we didn't
celebrate his birthday?

05:15.149 --> 05:17.282
When we go to birthday parties
and just stare at the person

05:17.284 --> 05:18.850
<i>while they eat cake</i>

-Too expensive.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.211
Even if we could afford
the rights to sing that song,
it wouldn't work.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.880
The only way to save him is to
celebrate his birthday

05:48.882 --> 05:51.083

05:53.887 --> 05:55.787
We may not make it back.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.889
Well, maybe he's not
so bad this way.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.925
The baby is adorable.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.728

wonderful stories.

Don't let the bows and
goody bags fool you.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.326
This place is super boring.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.228
If we don't complete
all the birthday rituals

06:36.230 --> 06:38.263
before that sparkler
burns down,

06:38.265 --> 06:39.431
we'll be stuck here.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.400
And we'll have to clean up
after the party.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.701
We can't let that happen.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.036
Then let's start with
the most important part,

06:45.038 --> 06:45.871
the song.

blow out the candles?

the lung capacity.

This is the last
birthday ritual.

We have to watch Beast Boy
open a present

09:04.278 --> 09:06.144

09:16.423 --> 09:20.959
I'll just gently peel back
the tape

to pretend to enjoy this.

isn't for me?

smile awkwardly?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.199
We did it!

10:03.069 --> 10:06.371
-(BELL TOLLS)
-Aw, yeah... (GRUNTS)

10:07.807 --> 10:10.108
We have to get back, come on.

10:12.478 --> 10:15.246
Everyone, through the door,
before the sparkler burns out.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.628
(GRUNTS)

10:29.630 --> 10:31.663
Sorry, I forgot your birthday,
Beast Boy.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.966
And we are sorry
we intentionally ignored it.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.868
We had no idea
it was so important

10:36.870 --> 10:39.304
to stare at you all day and
pretend to care about you.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.505
It's cool.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.541
Now, let's eat this cake.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.443
With the spit
and wax all over it?

10:45.445 --> 10:46.845
Yeah, boy...

10:46.847 --> 10:48.313
(GOBBLING)

10:48.315 --> 10:49.648
(ALL SHUDDERING)
