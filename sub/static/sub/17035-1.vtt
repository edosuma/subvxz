WEBVTT

00:06.689 --> 00:09.424
Ahh, the first leaves of fall...

00:09.426 --> 00:11.627
when you take the duct tape
off the sprinkler

00:11.629 --> 00:12.894
and put it back on the rake

00:12.896 --> 00:14.662
and you know summer's really over.

00:14.664 --> 00:16.531
Sue was coming back from Dollywood,

00:16.533 --> 00:18.333
where she'd spent the whole summer

00:18.335 --> 00:21.819
as a featured performer in
Ramblin' Jack's Banjo Review.

00:29.513 --> 00:31.879
Who said what?!

00:31.881 --> 00:35.983
And we were all excited
to see her, especially Mike.

00:36.518 --> 00:37.636
Would you relax?

00:37.638 --> 00:39.324
Sue will get here when she gets here.

00:39.646 --> 00:42.156
Ooh! White jeans!

00:42.190 --> 00:43.522
You don't have those.

00:43.524 --> 00:45.658
I'm sorry, Mom. No more cousin stuff.

00:45.660 --> 00:48.359
I'm putting my foot down,
and not in those Crocs.

00:48.361 --> 00:49.627
All right.

00:49.629 --> 00:51.529
I'm just gonna try
these snowpants on you

00:51.531 --> 00:52.530
while you talk.

00:52.532 --> 00:55.167
No! It's high school... a fresh start.

00:55.169 --> 00:56.301
First impressions are key.

00:56.303 --> 00:58.003
Most people decide what
they think about you

00:58.005 --> 00:59.871
within the first seven seconds
of meeting you.

00:59.873 --> 01:01.940
It's in this fascinating book
I've been reading.

01:01.942 --> 01:03.075
I found it by happenstance

01:03.077 --> 01:04.842
because it was erroneously mis-shelved.

01:04.843 --> 01:07.082
Don't tell that story
in the first seven seconds.

01:07.084 --> 01:10.348
Mike, you have got
to stop lurking in the windows.

01:10.350 --> 01:12.783
The baby next door is already
scared of you as it is.

01:12.785 --> 01:14.419
I mean, I know you're excited,

01:14.421 --> 01:16.554
but it won't get Sue home any faster.

01:16.556 --> 01:18.289
I'm not excited.

01:18.291 --> 01:19.824
I just thought I heard
the garbage tru...

01:19.826 --> 01:21.025
She's here!

01:21.027 --> 01:22.760
"Team Aniston"...

01:22.762 --> 01:23.861
I am totally gonna wear this!

01:23.863 --> 01:26.063
Hi!

01:26.065 --> 01:28.332
Hey, look who I found!

01:28.334 --> 01:31.702
Oh, my daughter... the featured player!

01:31.704 --> 01:33.971
Oh, my gosh! Tell me all about it!

01:33.973 --> 01:35.572
Oh, can you believe it?

01:35.574 --> 01:38.808
I was Girl In The Well
for 14 1/2 performances!

01:38.810 --> 01:40.510
And people loved us!

01:40.512 --> 01:42.579
I could tell they wanted to give
us a standing ovation,

01:42.581 --> 01:44.114
but a lot of them were in wheelchairs.

01:44.116 --> 01:45.349
No, not for a sad reason.

01:45.351 --> 01:47.684
- They were just fat.
- I'm gonna watch TV.

01:47.686 --> 01:49.185
Wha... You couldn't wait
for her to get home

01:49.187 --> 01:49.919
and now you're done?

01:49.921 --> 01:51.355
Yeah, she's home.

01:51.357 --> 01:53.366
By the by, since you're
only home two days

01:53.368 --> 01:54.506
before you leave for school,

01:54.508 --> 01:55.600
I'm still gonna live in your room.

01:55.602 --> 01:57.727
Good? Great. Welcome back.

01:57.729 --> 02:01.330
You know, I feel like I really
had an effect on people.

02:01.332 --> 02:03.699
Like, I heard a girl in line say,

02:03.701 --> 02:05.601
"Who said what?!"

02:05.603 --> 02:07.804
I mean, she went home
thinking that she could be

02:07.806 --> 02:10.157
Girl In The Well,
or "Who Said What" Girl.

02:10.158 --> 02:11.340
I didn't have an official name.

02:11.342 --> 02:12.875
This one nasty kid called me
"Sewer Head,"

02:12.877 --> 02:14.543
but I think he had other issues
'cause I saw him punch his mom.

02:14.545 --> 02:16.896
Honey, take a breath. I'm afraid
you're gonna pass out.

02:16.898 --> 02:18.007
Okay.

02:18.032 --> 02:21.317
Anyway, it all led to an epiphany.

02:21.319 --> 02:24.287
I am going to make acting my major.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.757
Oh, well... you don't have to
make that decision right now.

02:28.759 --> 02:31.093
You're right because it's already made.

02:31.095 --> 02:32.560
If there is one thing I learned

02:32.562 --> 02:34.296
from watching Dolly Parton's life story

02:34.298 --> 02:36.865
on a loop every nine minutes,
it's that you got to be all in!

02:36.867 --> 02:38.233
No backup plan!

02:38.235 --> 02:40.535
Hey! Little quieter
in there... trying to watch.

02:40.537 --> 02:42.271
He's so happy you're home.

02:46.276 --> 02:48.810
Huh, that looks a lot like our kid.

02:48.812 --> 02:50.845
Been so long since I seen him,
I can't be sure.

02:50.847 --> 02:51.982
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:52.007 --> 02:53.548
Hey.

02:54.851 --> 02:55.929
Oh, hey.

02:55.931 --> 02:56.982
Hey.

02:56.984 --> 02:58.286
You know we don't have any money.

02:58.288 --> 02:59.620
Obviously.

02:59.622 --> 03:02.190
Listen, you guys know I've been
seeing this girl.

03:02.192 --> 03:03.724
Well, she's coming by later.

03:03.726 --> 03:05.893
Okay. Well, I guess Dad and I
can go to CVS

03:05.895 --> 03:07.628
and read magazines or something.

03:07.630 --> 03:09.330
No, I want you guys here when she comes.

03:09.332 --> 03:11.732
- You do?
- Yeah.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.302
Sure, no problemo. It's all good.

03:14.304 --> 03:16.804
Great! Well, she'll be here
around 4:00, so put on a bra.

03:16.806 --> 03:18.305
I'm wearing a bra.

03:18.307 --> 03:19.807
Try again, Mom. This is important.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.946
Easy, girl.

03:25.948 --> 03:27.214
Did you hear that, Mike?!

03:27.216 --> 03:29.149
Axl wants us to meet his girlfriend!

03:29.151 --> 03:30.917
Oh, my God, she could be the one.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.819
No, that's something
that can happen now.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.521
He's at the age where the person
he's dating could be the one,

03:35.523 --> 03:38.058
and he knows that, and that's
why he wants us to meet her!

03:38.060 --> 03:40.260
Slow down. He's a little young for that.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.594
He's only...

03:41.596 --> 03:44.030
Whoa, he's about the age I was
when I met you.

03:44.032 --> 03:45.598
And I was the one.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.867
Damn near anyway.

03:46.869 --> 03:48.768
Oh, my gosh, my kid wants to
introduce us to her...

03:48.770 --> 03:50.102
his idea.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.671
And you can thank me for that

03:51.673 --> 03:53.539
because I played it cool all summer.

03:53.541 --> 03:56.108
I knew he was dating someone,
but for the first time,

03:56.110 --> 03:57.577
I didn't get all up in his "bidness."

03:57.579 --> 03:58.811
I didn't ask any questions.

03:58.813 --> 04:00.480
Don't say "bidness."

04:00.482 --> 04:02.047
No, I totally stayed out of it.

04:02.049 --> 04:04.083
Partly because I was
binge-watching "Outlander,"

04:04.085 --> 04:06.852
but mostly because I was
patient, and it paid off.

04:06.854 --> 04:09.121
Ooh, yeah! Playing it cool!

04:09.123 --> 04:11.556
Ohh. Threw your back out, didn't you?

04:11.558 --> 04:14.726
No, just bringing the dance down
a little bit.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.589
So, remember, Mike, this person

04:19.591 --> 04:23.002
is very special to Axl,
so you have to talk to her.

04:23.035 --> 04:25.536
Be social. Don't be your usual self.

04:25.538 --> 04:27.037
You know, just because I'm big

04:27.039 --> 04:28.638
doesn't mean words don't hurt me.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.407
Well, you really got to bring it.

04:30.409 --> 04:32.709
We may be about to meet the one,

04:32.711 --> 04:36.313
so you got to take it in,
be present, be in the moment.

04:36.315 --> 04:38.615
Oh, but also be in the future,

04:38.617 --> 04:40.383
where you can look back on this moment.

04:40.385 --> 04:41.484
But also be in the past,

04:41.486 --> 04:43.887
where Axl was a baby
so you can feel feelings.

04:43.889 --> 04:45.839
Oh, no wheelbarrow story.

04:45.841 --> 04:47.423
You're the only one
that thinks it's funny.

04:47.425 --> 04:49.859
I walked off with the wrong wheelbarrow!

04:49.861 --> 04:51.327
Everyone thinks that's funny.

04:52.664 --> 04:54.763
That's her. That's her!

04:58.103 --> 04:59.768
Hi!

04:59.770 --> 05:01.737
Come in, come in!

05:01.739 --> 05:04.974
You must be April!

05:04.976 --> 05:06.842
This is her!

05:06.844 --> 05:10.079
Mwah! Hey, babe. Find the place okay?

05:10.081 --> 05:12.180
I think so. This is it, right?

05:12.182 --> 05:13.348
Mm.

05:13.350 --> 05:14.717
I had a little trouble at first.

05:14.719 --> 05:16.318
You said to go south on Glenville,

05:16.320 --> 05:18.186
but you didn't say if it was
your south or my south.

05:18.188 --> 05:20.956
Well, April, these are my parents.

05:20.958 --> 05:22.891
Parents, this is April!

05:22.893 --> 05:25.160
Hi. I'm April.

05:25.162 --> 05:27.695
It's so nice to finally meet you, April.

05:27.697 --> 05:29.998
Oh, and... and this is Axl's
brother... Brick.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.032
Brick, say hi to April.

05:31.034 --> 05:33.201
Hi, I'm April!

05:33.203 --> 05:36.938
So, April, this guy
never tells us anything.

05:36.940 --> 05:39.374
So how exactly did you two meet?

05:39.376 --> 05:40.775
Oh, my gosh.

05:40.777 --> 05:43.611
It's such a good story.

05:44.372 --> 05:48.049
He saw me, and he came over...

05:49.619 --> 05:53.420
He said hi, and I said hi.

05:56.739 --> 05:59.661
Oh, that is a good story.

05:59.662 --> 06:00.894
Especially the way she tells it.

06:02.298 --> 06:04.131
So, April, are you from around here?

06:04.133 --> 06:08.735
Well, not this street,
but I graduated from Orson CC.

06:08.737 --> 06:11.372
That's community college.

06:11.374 --> 06:15.276
Now I work at Orson CC.
That stands for country club.

06:15.278 --> 06:16.710
It's confusing.

06:16.712 --> 06:19.412
I mean, let's use some other
letters of the alphabet, people.

06:19.414 --> 06:21.481
There's like 35 of them.

06:21.483 --> 06:26.319
But I love my job.

06:26.321 --> 06:31.091
It's so... oh, what's the word?

06:31.523 --> 06:32.525
Good.

06:32.527 --> 06:33.959
So after 20 more minutes

06:33.961 --> 06:36.429
of scintillating conversation with April

06:36.431 --> 06:40.266
and hearing how she thinks
world peace would be... good,

06:40.268 --> 06:42.535
she and Axl were off to the movies.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.873
Oh, my God, right?

06:48.268 --> 06:49.661
What? I liked her.

06:50.001 --> 06:52.044
You liked her? You liked her.

06:52.046 --> 06:54.513
Uh, she didn't strike you
as a little, um...

06:54.515 --> 06:55.681
Oh, what's the word?

06:55.683 --> 06:56.782
dumb?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.241
No, she seemed okay.

06:58.266 --> 06:59.618
Are you kidding?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.317
She asked if the grapes were homemade.

07:01.319 --> 07:02.888
Brick, back me up on this.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.324
I once saw a cartoon where
a wolf saw a sexy rabbit

07:05.326 --> 07:07.726
in a nightclub, and his tongue
came out like steps.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.229
That's how she made me feel...
April, not the rabbit.

07:10.231 --> 07:11.896
A little bit the rabbit.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.398
You just like her 'cause she's pretty.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.567
I just liked you 'cause you were pretty.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.801
Really?

07:16.803 --> 07:18.737
Still, I had something
going on upstairs.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.139
But I was mainly interested
in your downstairs.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.974
You guys know I'm still
in the room, right?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.675
Look, I don't see what the big deal is.

07:24.677 --> 07:27.411
The big deal is our son cannot
end up with a ding-dong...

07:27.413 --> 07:29.080
Wait, did you say "were pretty"?

07:29.082 --> 07:30.915
I don't know.
Maybe they're a good match.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.084
It's not like Axl's the sharpest
tool in the shed.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.120
Yeah, but at least he can find the shed.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.454
Listen, he needs to marry up

07:36.456 --> 07:38.289
in the brains department, not down.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.091
Their kids are gonna be wearing
their pants on their heads!

07:41.093 --> 07:43.093
Oh, my God, this is my fault.

07:43.095 --> 07:44.395
I shouldn't have played it cool.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.063
I should have been all up in his grille.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.965
Don't say "all up in his grille."

07:47.967 --> 07:49.933
Don't say "were pretty."

07:52.772 --> 07:54.472
Hey, Brick! Oh.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.540
Super psyched about changing
my major to theater.

07:57.542 --> 08:00.077
Yep, I am all-in.

08:00.079 --> 08:01.779
No backup plan.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.713
And yet, so few make it.

08:03.715 --> 08:05.783
Maybe I do need a backup plan.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.152
But maybe those who make it only make it

08:08.154 --> 08:10.053
because they don't have a backup plan.

08:10.055 --> 08:12.155
But if I don't have a backup plan

08:12.157 --> 08:14.424
and I fail, then I have nothing.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.693
Sue, today's kind of a big day for me.

08:16.695 --> 08:18.762
I grew my hair the perfect amount,

08:18.764 --> 08:21.731
I'm rocking new jeans,
I even have a normal backpack.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.199
No more pizza bag.

08:23.201 --> 08:25.635
Oh, my God, Brick, I am so sorry.

08:25.637 --> 08:26.936
It's your first day of high school!

08:26.938 --> 08:28.137
Uh! How are you feeling?

08:28.139 --> 08:29.972
Are you excited? Are you nervous?

08:29.974 --> 08:31.573
Oh, man, I envy you that you do not

08:31.575 --> 08:33.342
have to make any big life decisions yet.

08:33.344 --> 08:36.544
I mean, I did, but I am
totally fine with it.

08:36.547 --> 08:38.527
Yeah. No regrets here.

08:39.456 --> 08:40.448
It's all good.

08:40.451 --> 08:41.818
I have a foolproof plan.

08:41.820 --> 08:44.253
I don't have lunch period
with Cindy or Troy,

08:44.255 --> 08:45.987
but I do have it with Duncan,

08:45.989 --> 08:47.690
this popular kid from my old school.

08:47.692 --> 08:50.015
If I can sit with him, I'm set.

08:51.228 --> 08:53.495
Hey, high-school boy. You want a lift?

08:53.497 --> 08:55.431
No, I don't want a ride from my mom.

08:55.433 --> 08:56.898
It'll look weird.

09:02.172 --> 09:04.867
So, I was thinking if we pack smart,

09:04.869 --> 09:06.975
I think we can get you up
to school in one car.

09:06.977 --> 09:09.978
Oh, and we can stop at the new
outlet mall on the way.

09:09.980 --> 09:12.780
They have a Wetzel's Pretzels
where they only sell "oopsies."

09:12.782 --> 09:14.482
Oh, actually, you don't need to take me.

09:14.484 --> 09:15.851
I'm gonna ride up with Jeremy.

09:16.452 --> 09:18.520
Oh, Jeremy... Tree Guy Jeremy.

09:18.521 --> 09:20.254
I didn't know that was still a thing.

09:20.256 --> 09:22.590
Yeah, we've been texting
a lot over summer.

09:22.592 --> 09:24.625
Well, that's just more free time for me.

09:24.627 --> 09:26.461
That's great.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.597
This sucks.

09:29.599 --> 09:31.758
Sue doesn't need me to take her
back to college,

09:31.760 --> 09:34.601
Brick is growing his hair,
Axl is marrying a simpleton.

09:34.603 --> 09:36.203
It's all slipping away, Mike.

09:36.205 --> 09:38.605
They're growing up, moving on.

09:38.607 --> 09:39.773
Good.

09:39.775 --> 09:41.472
It's not good.

09:41.474 --> 09:43.978
The moments are rushing by,
the window is closing.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.046
Don't you feel the rushing
and the closing?

09:46.553 --> 09:48.850
I miss people differently
than you do, Frankie.

09:48.851 --> 09:51.752
Quietly, to myself. You should try it.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.021
Can't I get support from anyone
around here?

09:55.023 --> 09:56.356
I'm on Team Aniston.

09:56.358 --> 09:58.191
Why can't you be on Team Frankie?

09:58.193 --> 09:59.959
What's Team Aniston?

09:59.961 --> 10:02.061
Ugh, how are we even a couple?

10:02.063 --> 10:03.530
Ooh, I know!

10:03.532 --> 10:05.298
We should have a dinner.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.133
Yeah, before everyone scatters.

10:07.135 --> 10:09.235
Then I can tell them exactly
how much I love them

10:09.237 --> 10:10.836
'cause I do love them so much, Mike.

10:10.838 --> 10:12.405
I just don't say it enough,

10:12.407 --> 10:15.106
and I never take the time to tell them.

10:15.108 --> 10:16.164
I'll make a toast.

10:16.166 --> 10:19.312
Something about the closing
of the window

10:19.314 --> 10:21.614
and how they're storm windows,

10:21.616 --> 10:23.982
but in the spring, we take them down

10:23.984 --> 10:26.051
and there are screens there that...

10:26.053 --> 10:29.321
that let the love just seep through...

10:29.323 --> 10:32.658
I-I'll have it locked down by the toast.

10:34.595 --> 10:38.230
So, Brick was ready to face his
first lunch of high school.

10:38.232 --> 10:40.132
He had three dollops of spaghetti,

10:40.134 --> 10:42.801
two fruit cups, and one solid plan.

10:44.338 --> 10:45.503
Hi, Duncan.

10:45.505 --> 10:46.805
Hey, dude.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.910
Well, he figured out
the first part of the plan.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.313
He just hadn't figured out
anything after that.

10:56.716 --> 10:58.650
High school.

10:58.652 --> 10:59.984
Crazy, huh?

11:01.154 --> 11:03.505
The trays are on the left
instead of the right.

11:04.492 --> 11:07.325
Yeah, I went the wrong way today.

11:10.263 --> 11:12.363
Hey.

11:12.365 --> 11:14.832
Yep, it was all going well until...

11:14.834 --> 11:16.063
I know that girl.

11:16.065 --> 11:17.634
Her Instagram has 5,000 followers.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.437
Let's see if we can sit with her.

11:19.439 --> 11:21.005
That's the point guard

11:21.007 --> 11:22.173
from David Letterman Middle School.

11:22.175 --> 11:24.041
There's two seats at his table.

11:24.043 --> 11:24.976
Let's go.

11:24.978 --> 11:26.643
No.

11:32.451 --> 11:34.351
Brick discovered he wasn't the only one

11:34.353 --> 11:36.252
jockeying for position that first day.

11:37.890 --> 11:39.923
Hello, old friend.

11:39.925 --> 11:41.091
Friend.

11:41.093 --> 11:42.826
Whoo. Damn it!

11:46.399 --> 11:47.732
You're being awfully helpful.

11:47.734 --> 11:49.584
I'm on Team Frankie.

11:49.586 --> 11:51.468
I don't want to fight anymore.
I'm tired.

11:53.839 --> 11:55.991
Well, that was a bust.

11:55.993 --> 11:58.208
First day of high school,
and once again,

11:58.210 --> 12:01.078
I'm the oddball who talks
to his backpack.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.919
So much for a fresh start.

12:02.966 --> 12:04.381
Aw, maybe nobody saw you.

12:04.383 --> 12:06.569
No, five people saw me.
But you're right.

12:06.632 --> 12:08.764
High school is better 'cause
only three of them made fun of me.

12:08.766 --> 12:10.219
Well, no one's making fun
of you at dinner.

12:10.221 --> 12:12.488
Eh, that haircut makes you
look like a Muppet.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.791
Not a main one, like one
that played a waiter.

12:14.793 --> 12:15.959
Axl!

12:15.961 --> 12:17.556
What? You said, "At dinner."

12:19.591 --> 12:21.791
Okay, everything looks good.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.225
So, I made noodle casserole.

12:26.861 --> 12:29.628
Brick, I'm thinking I should
have a backup plan

12:29.630 --> 12:31.396
for the acting major,
but if I know what it is,

12:31.398 --> 12:32.698
then I might give up on my dream.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.099
So could you come up with one for me,

12:34.101 --> 12:35.734
write it down,
but don't tell me what it is?

12:35.735 --> 12:37.468
- Sure.
- Great.

12:37.493 --> 12:39.236
Make two copies and give one
to somebody else,

12:39.238 --> 12:40.971
in case you die.

12:40.973 --> 12:43.207
- What?
- Sorry I'm late.

12:43.209 --> 12:45.109
I went wrong south again.

12:45.111 --> 12:48.845
Oh, well, we're just so happy
to have you!

12:48.847 --> 12:51.115
Oops. Oh, did I forget an extra chair?

12:51.117 --> 12:53.317
Axl, you want to come into the
dining room and help me get one?

12:53.319 --> 12:54.618
Sue, why don't you entertain April.

12:56.121 --> 12:57.754
Hi! I'm April.

12:57.756 --> 13:00.123
Sue. Theater major. All in.

13:00.125 --> 13:02.358
Well, except for my secret backup plan,

13:02.360 --> 13:04.260
which I won't need
because I am gonna make it.

13:04.262 --> 13:05.796
How exciting.

13:05.798 --> 13:07.464
Will you be in anything I've heard of?

13:07.466 --> 13:09.466
Ye... Wait.

13:09.468 --> 13:12.335
What a nice surprise to have April.

13:12.337 --> 13:14.670
Although I thought it was just
gonna be the core group,

13:14.672 --> 13:15.838
so I wasn't prepared.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.374
So you think she's gonna stay
the whole time?

13:18.376 --> 13:21.444
I'm so glad you like her.
Isn't she great?

13:21.446 --> 13:23.779
Yeah, she's... pretty.

13:23.781 --> 13:26.082
Although I was gonna make a toast,

13:26.084 --> 13:28.350
kind of just for the core group.

13:28.352 --> 13:30.219
Did you notice how her hair
smells like fruit?

13:30.221 --> 13:32.321
Not the real fruit,

13:32.323 --> 13:34.223
but the good kind, like in candy.

13:34.225 --> 13:35.858
And there's no drama with her, ever.

13:35.860 --> 13:38.527
It's just... the best.

13:44.568 --> 13:47.536
Okay.

13:47.538 --> 13:49.938
Here we go.

13:49.940 --> 13:52.907
I guess I just counted wrong
the first time.

13:52.909 --> 13:55.310
That's okay. I do that a lot, too.

14:00.050 --> 14:02.150
Um, excuse me. Where's your bathroom?

14:02.152 --> 14:05.353
Oh, it's down the hall,
first door on the left.

14:05.355 --> 14:06.888
Hurry back!

14:08.424 --> 14:10.025
Okay, now that I have
the core group here,

14:10.027 --> 14:11.126
I want to say something.

14:11.128 --> 14:12.293
Raise your glass.
I'm gonna make a toast.

14:12.295 --> 14:13.327
I just want to say...

14:13.329 --> 14:14.529
I don't have anything in my glass.

14:14.531 --> 14:16.197
- Well, here, have some of mine.
- Ew! No.

14:16.199 --> 14:17.931
I used to breast feed you!

14:17.933 --> 14:19.233
Oh, worst toast ever.

14:19.235 --> 14:21.902
I'm sorry. This house is a maze.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.771
You said, "Down the hall...?"

14:23.773 --> 14:25.339
First door on the left!

14:25.341 --> 14:27.135
"First door on the left."

14:27.137 --> 14:29.743
"First door on the left."

14:29.745 --> 14:31.646
All right.

14:31.648 --> 14:33.714
I just want to say time is moving fast

14:33.716 --> 14:35.983
and these moments are fewer and fewer.

14:35.985 --> 14:38.618
And especially with the...
the storm window of life c...

14:40.856 --> 14:42.723
You're doing good.

14:44.526 --> 14:46.293
Team Frankie!

14:46.295 --> 14:47.360
Go ahead, Mom.

14:47.362 --> 14:49.029
No, no, we have to wait for Dad.

14:49.031 --> 14:50.330
It's a family thing.

14:50.332 --> 14:52.365
Sue, this guy says he knows you.

14:52.367 --> 14:54.767
Oh, Jeremy!

14:54.769 --> 14:56.636
Hi! You're early!

14:56.638 --> 14:57.804
We weren't supposed to leave
till tomorrow.

14:57.806 --> 14:59.372
I was biking through Missouri

14:59.374 --> 15:00.907
to protest feeding antacids to cows,

15:00.909 --> 15:02.175
and I made good time.

15:02.177 --> 15:04.211
Ohhh. Well, great.
Now you can stay for dinner.

15:04.213 --> 15:06.546
Yay! Jeremy's joining us for dinner.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.083
Axl. Sue's brother.

15:09.084 --> 15:10.149
Namaste.

15:10.151 --> 15:11.450
Nam...

15:11.452 --> 15:14.320
Oh, April! Jeremy.
Jeremy, this is April.

15:14.322 --> 15:15.822
Hi. I'm April!

15:17.192 --> 15:18.825
Wow, there's so many introductions,

15:18.827 --> 15:20.727
we're not even gonna have
time for dinner.

15:20.729 --> 15:22.195
Maybe there's too many people.

15:22.197 --> 15:24.463
Just kidding. Everybody's welcome.

15:25.494 --> 15:28.235
So, Dad, Jeremy is from Indianapolis.

15:28.236 --> 15:30.135
Oh, yeah? So you follow the Colts?

15:30.137 --> 15:32.738
No, Mike. I follow the underpaid workers

15:32.740 --> 15:34.840
who make the footballs the Colts "earn"

15:34.842 --> 15:36.575
their multi-million-dollar
salaries with.

15:37.778 --> 15:39.044
Did he just call me Mike?

15:39.046 --> 15:40.278
So, April...

15:41.416 --> 15:42.371
April?

15:42.373 --> 15:43.148
April!

15:43.150 --> 15:44.983
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.052
I thought you were talking
about the month.

15:47.054 --> 15:48.820
I guess that happens
with all month names.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.823
I wish I had a less complicated
name, like June.

15:52.267 --> 15:53.860
But June is a month.

15:54.219 --> 15:55.828
Right, but like June or Mary.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.962
Yeah, so Mary's not a month.

15:58.227 --> 15:59.997
But it sounds like May.

16:00.595 --> 16:01.866
I'm sorry, Mike.

16:01.868 --> 16:03.468
I just don't worship
at the altar of violence

16:03.470 --> 16:04.835
and testosterone poisoning.

16:04.837 --> 16:07.405
There's a lot of benefit to
playing sports, you know?

16:07.407 --> 16:09.106
You learn a lot about character.

16:09.108 --> 16:10.975
Or you can learn that from your parents.

16:10.977 --> 16:12.577
Mm-hmm.

16:12.579 --> 16:14.611
You know what is a really
interesting field?

16:14.613 --> 16:16.013
Sports medicine.

16:16.015 --> 16:18.082
I mean, you know, not for me, obviously,

16:18.084 --> 16:19.183
but for someone else.

16:19.185 --> 16:21.018
Maybe for me.

16:24.223 --> 16:26.791
- Brick, what are you doing?
- Oh, texting Cindy.

16:26.793 --> 16:28.725
Since everyone else has
their significant others here,

16:28.727 --> 16:29.793
I should, too.

16:29.795 --> 16:30.994
Brick, we've already started.

16:30.996 --> 16:32.796
By the time Cindy gets here,
dinner's gonna be over.

16:34.366 --> 16:35.766
How did you get here so fast?

16:35.768 --> 16:36.933
My mom took to her bed,

16:36.935 --> 16:38.935
so I have to fend for myself for dinner.

16:38.937 --> 16:40.937
I was eating apples
from your neighbor's tree.

16:41.807 --> 16:43.039
Who's the blonde?

16:43.041 --> 16:45.342
- That's April.
- Hi, I'm April!

16:45.344 --> 16:48.211
Oh. No shrimp?

16:48.213 --> 16:51.681
I'm irritated, but I'll hide it.

16:56.754 --> 17:00.389
So, Cindy, what's new in your world?

17:00.391 --> 17:02.491
My bio teacher has six fingers
on one hand.

17:02.493 --> 17:04.827
At first, I thought he was
holding a pencil, but he wasn't.

17:04.829 --> 17:05.928
When he's holding a pencil,

17:05.930 --> 17:07.430
it looks like he has seven fingers.

17:07.432 --> 17:09.632
Sorry, I'm just having
a really hard time

17:09.634 --> 17:11.701
hiding my irritation about the shrimp.

17:11.703 --> 17:14.069
You know where you can
really learn about character, Mike?

17:14.070 --> 17:16.104
Living on the streets
and eating out of Dumpsters,

17:16.106 --> 17:18.406
just to see what it's like to
live below the poverty line.

17:18.409 --> 17:19.607
You did that?

17:19.608 --> 17:21.009
No, my friend Rob saw a documentary.

17:21.011 --> 17:22.978
Jeremy... can I call you Jeremy?

17:22.980 --> 17:24.012
Sure!

17:24.013 --> 17:25.480
Well, you can't call me Mike.

17:25.482 --> 17:28.450
You know, maybe we should just
head on up to school now.

17:28.452 --> 17:29.985
What? No, why?

17:29.987 --> 17:32.454
Well, I-I feel like I should get
settled before it's too late.

17:32.456 --> 17:34.957
Fine, I'll strap my bike to
your four-wheel planet killer.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.958
We get it, Jeremy. You don't like cars.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.549
Wait, you can't go yet.
There's something I wanted...

17:40.530 --> 17:42.797
You know, I need some help
at the fridge.

17:44.079 --> 17:46.469
I'm just gonna randomly
pick four people...

17:46.470 --> 17:47.502
Sue, Mike, Axl, Brick.

17:47.504 --> 17:48.670
Did she say April?

17:48.672 --> 17:50.204
Just meet me over here!

17:54.477 --> 17:55.542
What are we looking for?

17:55.544 --> 17:57.111
Nothing. I want to say something,

17:57.113 --> 17:58.779
and I want it to be just the family.

17:58.781 --> 18:00.381
You better pray there's
some shrimp in here.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.383
Just stay with me for a minute,
okay, Brick?

18:02.385 --> 18:03.417
I want to make a toast.

18:03.419 --> 18:04.618
But our drinks are back there.

18:06.189 --> 18:08.022
There's something I wanted to say

18:08.024 --> 18:10.223
because I realized
I don't say it enough.

18:10.225 --> 18:11.492
I don't like olives.

18:11.494 --> 18:13.394
You don't have to actually drink it.

18:15.197 --> 18:18.599
Time is fleeting.
These moments are precious...

18:18.601 --> 18:20.066
I'll trade you your olives
for my soy sauce.

18:20.068 --> 18:21.502
Yes.

18:21.504 --> 18:23.103
Because we won't have many more
with just the core four...

18:23.105 --> 18:24.772
- Five.
- Five... I knew that.

18:24.774 --> 18:26.106
The rhyme threw me off.

18:26.108 --> 18:28.241
Look, we have a window, a small...

18:28.243 --> 18:29.809
Where's your bathroom, again?

18:29.811 --> 18:32.279
Would you just hold it
for a second, April?!

18:32.708 --> 18:33.888
We're at a crossroads.

18:33.890 --> 18:35.748
Axl's a senior,
Brick is in high school...

18:35.750 --> 18:37.117
I should really show April
where the bathroom...

18:37.119 --> 18:39.286
No, you are not showing her
where the bathroom is!

18:39.288 --> 18:42.522
Look, what I'm trying to tell
you is that I love you!

18:42.524 --> 18:43.823
I love you, and we have to

18:43.825 --> 18:45.625
appreciate these moments together

18:45.627 --> 18:47.894
because we will never have
this again, never!

18:47.896 --> 18:49.295
Do you get that?!

18:49.297 --> 18:51.196
The storm windows are shutting!

18:51.198 --> 18:53.165
I'm gonna ditch the whole idea
of the storm windows.

18:53.167 --> 18:54.801
The point is, I love you!

18:54.803 --> 18:56.736
Now, clink your mayonnaise
and your olives together

18:56.738 --> 18:57.770
like you mean it!

19:02.443 --> 19:03.976
It's one night.

19:03.978 --> 19:05.210
No, it's not.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.012
This is our future, Mike.

19:07.014 --> 19:09.181
It's never gonna be
just the five of us again.

19:09.183 --> 19:12.317
The core group is dead.
It's us plus three strangers.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.386
I should just go down
to the bus station,

19:14.388 --> 19:15.988
pick up three hobos, and say,

19:15.990 --> 19:17.722
"Hey, you want to spend
every Christmas together

19:17.724 --> 19:18.756
for the rest of our lives?"

19:18.758 --> 19:20.758
I'm not spending Christmas with Jeremy.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.996
I'll tell you that. I'd like to sock
that guy in his beardy face.

19:23.998 --> 19:26.798
I am telling you, these losers
could be our in-laws.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.433
April could be it for Axl!

19:28.435 --> 19:30.134
What are you worried about April for?

19:30.136 --> 19:31.636
Jeremy's the one to worry about.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.671
He's trying to take away
the one thing I love.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.973
Sue?

19:34.975 --> 19:36.007
No, the Colts.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.309
This is how bad it is.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.879
We're crossing our fingers for Cindy.

19:40.881 --> 19:44.115
That's it.

19:44.117 --> 19:45.349
I'm done being cool.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.518
Axl needs an uncool mom's advice.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.919
You know what I think?

19:49.544 --> 19:51.522
I think he brought her here
for a reason.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.165
He wants me to tell him the truth.

19:54.167 --> 19:55.573
I'm gonna go out there right now

19:55.575 --> 19:57.521
and tell him exactly
what I think of her.

20:10.234 --> 20:12.899
Yep, Axl was in love...

20:13.646 --> 20:16.079
and April accidentally took my coat.

20:20.585 --> 20:22.385
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't do it.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.953
He loves her.

20:23.955 --> 20:26.059
There's nothing to be gained
by me saying anything.

20:26.084 --> 20:27.857
It's just not gonna go my way.

20:29.428 --> 20:33.568
You think you can control
things, but you really can't.

20:33.998 --> 20:36.165
You make plans and backup plans

20:36.167 --> 20:39.101
and backup plans to your backup plans.

20:41.105 --> 20:42.872
But then stuff happens,

20:42.874 --> 20:45.541
and your plans go out the window.

20:45.543 --> 20:47.109
'Cause more often than not,

20:47.111 --> 20:49.912
it's about the little things
you don't plan for.

20:49.914 --> 20:51.980
Cool backpack.

20:51.982 --> 20:54.248
Thanks! You too.

20:56.519 --> 20:58.486
You ever talk to yours?

20:58.488 --> 21:00.488
- What?
- Nothing.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.427
Maybe we shouldn't plan at all.

21:06.429 --> 21:09.998
Maybe we should just be
in the moment we're in

21:10.000 --> 21:13.901
and enjoy the time we have
with the people we love.

21:13.903 --> 21:15.269
Damn it!

21:15.271 --> 21:17.071
That would've been the perfect toast.

21:17.073 --> 21:18.939
Oh, I'll save it for Thanksgiving.

21:18.941 --> 21:21.509
I hope it's just the core group.
