00:18.130 --> 00:20.530

I'll kill you!

Tag up! Tag up!

00:42.820 --> 00:43.660
What?!

00:44.860 --> 00:46.860
Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you?

00:46.860 --> 00:49.130
I think he wants me to put the hurt on him!

00:49.130 --> 00:50.830
I think he wants you to put the hurt on him!

00:50.830 --> 00:52.460
You think he wants me to put the hurt on him?!

00:52.460 --> 00:53.400
Yes, I do!

01:04.810 --> 01:07.380
Did you see how awesome it was
when I hit the trampoline?

01:08.480 --> 01:10.210
Yeah, I did!

01:10.720 --> 01:13.720
But it wasn't as awesome as
when you punched that hole in the wall!

01:21.660 --> 01:24.060
I can't believe I listened to you!

01:24.060 --> 01:25.730
I knew I should've got out to do some work,

01:25.730 --> 01:28.830
but no. Let's wrestle this stupid doll, it'll be fun!

01:28.830 --> 01:30.270
But it WAS fun!

01:30.270 --> 01:33.240
Well, yeah. But, now there's a big hole in the wall!

01:33.240 --> 01:34.510
Dude, we're 23 years old,

01:34.510 --> 01:37.640
we shouldn't be busting holes in walls.
We're gonna get fired for this!

01:37.640 --> 01:39.580
You mean, YOU'RE gonna get fired for this.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.480
What?

01:40.480 --> 01:42.410
You're the one who threw me too hard, ya hole!

01:42.510 --> 01:45.280
Don't call me a hole! You're the hole,
you're the one who wanted to wrestle!

01:46.580 --> 01:50.890
Let's not blame anyone! Now,
how in the "h" are we gonna fix this "s"?

01:50.890 --> 01:52.190
I don't know man.

01:52.220 --> 01:56.490
We can't fix it, and we definitely can't
pay for it, 'cause we don't have any money!

01:56.490 --> 01:57.730
Unless, you have some money.

01:57.730 --> 02:01.570
No. Besides, I don't even know
how much it costs to fix a hole like this.

02:01.570 --> 02:02.770
Probably a ton.

02:02.770 --> 02:03.670
Exactly.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.800
Which leaves us with only ONE possible solution:

02:06.800 --> 02:09.639
We convince Benson to give us raises

02:09.639 --> 02:12.980
so we can afford to pay someone else to fix it.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.050
Dude...you are a GENIUS!

02:17.050 --> 02:18.480
Of COURSE raises!

02:18.480 --> 02:20.250
-Okay, dude, here's-
-Let me stop you there

02:20.250 --> 02:22.320
because I already know what you're going to say!

02:22.790 --> 02:24.390
HAAAAMBONING.

02:24.920 --> 02:25.490
What?

02:32.460 --> 02:33.670
No, man! Stop it!

02:33.670 --> 02:36.170
We just need to ask him for a raise and just explain all the-

02:36.170 --> 02:38.240
No, no, NO, that's not gonna work!

02:38.240 --> 02:39.340
What are you, 65?

02:39.340 --> 02:41.840
"Excuse me, sir, can I have a raise?"

02:41.840 --> 02:42.910
COME ON!

02:42.910 --> 02:46.610
I'm telling you, dude! HAAAMBONIIIING.

02:46.610 --> 02:47.780
Noooooo.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.610
Hamboning will save your LIFE someday!

02:49.610 --> 02:52.020
It'll be all like, "What? You're trying to mug me?

02:53.480 --> 02:55.690
No! We're not doing that, okay?

02:55.950 --> 02:56.790
OKAY?!

02:56.890 --> 02:58.120
Fine...

02:59.390 --> 03:00.560
I know what to do!

03:02.330 --> 03:04.860
Are you ready for raises?

03:08.800 --> 03:09.970
How did you get that?

03:09.970 --> 03:11.300
I have my methods.

03:27.450 --> 03:28.450
I don't know, dude.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.090
How's that gonna get us raises?

03:30.090 --> 03:31.320
Aw, come on, man! Look.

03:31.820 --> 03:32.890
Just come check it out.

03:39.430 --> 03:42.100
This is the answer to ALL our problems.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.270
Have you named her yet?

03:43.270 --> 03:45.540
Actually, I thought YOU could do the honors.

03:45.540 --> 03:46.270
Really?

03:46.970 --> 03:51.080
Ya know, I've always wanted to
date a girl named: The Power.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.040
The Power?

03:52.810 --> 03:53.780
I like it.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.890
Cool...!

04:01.750 --> 04:03.190
Alright, this time with feeling.

04:04.060 --> 04:04.590
Ready?

04:10.330 --> 04:12.460
Give us a raise, loser!

04:15.700 --> 04:16.529
Hey, it's Pops.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.300
Hello.

04:18.339 --> 04:19.399
Hey Pops, what's up?

04:19.540 --> 04:22.070
Is that the sound of music I hear?

04:22.140 --> 04:23.810
Dude, let's use The Power on Pops.

04:23.810 --> 04:24.580
I don't know,

04:24.640 --> 04:25.740
Pops is kind of weird.

04:29.410 --> 04:30.210
Exactly.

04:30.210 --> 04:31.720
At least we can test it out on him,

04:31.720 --> 04:33.450
and he won't get mad at us if it doesn't work. 

04:33.950 --> 04:34.520
Ok.

04:34.550 --> 04:35.820
But let's not call him a loser. 

04:35.820 --> 04:36.390
Why not? 

04:36.450 --> 04:37.290
He's sensitive.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.220
I don't want him to cry,

04:38.220 --> 04:39.490
I just want him to give us a raise. 

04:39.590 --> 04:40.690
Ok, let's do it.

04:40.830 --> 04:42.690
Hey Pops! Check it.

04:46.630 --> 04:48.700
Give us a raise, Pops!

04:52.300 --> 04:53.600
Good show,

04:53.670 --> 04:55.310
jolly good show!

04:55.440 --> 04:58.480
A pay increase, yes yes of course.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.910
Just let me get my billfold. 

05:01.210 --> 05:03.150
Butterscotch Ripple?

05:08.720 --> 05:10.250
 Dude, I think that just worked. 

05:10.250 --> 05:10.990
Yeah, I know. 

05:10.990 --> 05:12.790
 I mean, if Pops wasn't so weird

05:12.790 --> 05:14.660
he might have given us actual money. 

05:14.660 --> 05:15.490
Totally. 

05:25.440 --> 05:26.770
Hey, Benson.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.180
What are you doing? 

05:32.210 --> 05:34.410
Give us a raise, loser. 

05:38.480 --> 05:40.650
You know, you guys have been working harder.

05:40.650 --> 05:42.190
I think you deserve a raise.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.560
We can negotiate your new rates later in the week,

05:44.560 --> 05:45.190
but for now,

05:45.190 --> 05:46.760
how's 20 bucks sound?

05:48.160 --> 05:49.430
Keep up the good work.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.700
Do you realize what this means? 

05:52.760 --> 05:53.970
We can fix the hole? 

05:54.130 --> 05:54.700
No,

05:54.830 --> 05:57.770
No, we can do everything we ever wanted! 

06:34.770 --> 06:37.280
You guys shouldn't be doing what you just did. 

06:37.410 --> 06:38.810
What, the flying or the hole? 

06:38.880 --> 06:39.740
What hole? 

06:39.740 --> 06:41.810
Dude, get to The Power, he knows. 

06:41.810 --> 06:42.750
Knows what?

06:42.850 --> 06:43.680
Nothing Skips,

06:44.050 --> 06:45.420
we were just getting back to work.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.950
Dude, kick it to max power. 

06:50.050 --> 06:52.090
Using the Power in your face,

06:53.020 --> 06:55.130
sending you back to your place.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.360
Don't look at our crotches

06:57.360 --> 06:59.730
while we synchronize our watches. 

07:05.400 --> 07:07.240
Synchronized.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.010
Go away Skips,

07:13.010 --> 07:14.850
it's time for you to go away. 

07:14.850 --> 07:17.650
It's time for you to go your room. 

07:17.680 --> 07:18.520
Yeah Skips,

07:18.720 --> 07:21.920
it's time for you to go to the moon. 

07:24.490 --> 07:25.190
Where'd he go? 

07:26.090 --> 07:27.790
Did you just send Skips to the moon? 

07:27.960 --> 07:29.030
-Isn't that what you said? 
-No!

07:29.090 --> 07:29.690
room!

07:29.690 --> 07:30.630
I sent him to his room,

07:30.630 --> 07:32.130
not the moon you idiot!

07:32.130 --> 07:33.330
Dude, wish him back. 

07:33.360 --> 07:34.700
But it doesn't work that way. 

07:34.700 --> 07:35.430
What do you mean? 

07:35.430 --> 07:37.170
I can't see him, can I? 

07:37.440 --> 07:38.640
Then we have to go get him. 

07:38.770 --> 07:39.970
But he's going to be pissed! 

07:40.170 --> 07:41.410
Better than him being dead. 

07:42.170 --> 07:44.080
Hey, have you two seen Skips? 

07:44.210 --> 07:45.580
Rigby sent him to the moon. 

07:48.250 --> 07:49.180
Wait, what? 

07:49.350 --> 07:51.380
We accidentally sent Skips to the moon with this keyboard

07:51.380 --> 07:52.550
and now we have to get him back. 

07:54.220 --> 07:56.220
I love the moon. 

07:56.390 --> 07:57.220
Come on,

07:57.220 --> 07:58.820
where's Skips? 

07:59.520 --> 08:00.990
Look, we'll show you. 

08:01.690 --> 08:02.990
Come on, let's go!

08:03.530 --> 08:04.730
You take forever. 

08:04.730 --> 08:05.300
Sorry,

08:05.300 --> 08:06.660
Pops had to go to the bathroom. 

08:06.730 --> 08:07.730
Twice.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.270
So what do we do? 

08:09.470 --> 08:10.070
Don't worry,

08:10.070 --> 08:10.940
we got it. 

08:10.970 --> 08:13.100
Take us to the moon!

08:14.070 --> 08:15.970
Won't you take us to the moon? 

08:17.610 --> 08:18.610
Very fun- 

08:29.090 --> 08:30.860
What is all this junk? 

08:32.390 --> 08:33.860
Um, don't get mad at me guys,

08:33.860 --> 08:36.059
but, uh, I kinda sent a bunch of stuff to the moon

08:36.059 --> 08:37.330
while you guys were in the house. 

08:37.400 --> 08:38.600
A bunch of baby ducks,

08:38.600 --> 08:39.960
send 'em to the moon!

08:39.960 --> 08:41.400
Soda machine, that doesn't work,

08:41.400 --> 08:42.730
send 'em to the moon! 

08:42.770 --> 08:43.740
You drillbit!

08:43.740 --> 08:44.970
What else did you send?! 

08:47.910 --> 08:49.310
Look, it's Skips!

08:49.310 --> 08:50.340
There he is! 

08:50.910 --> 08:51.710
Oh great,

08:51.710 --> 08:53.040
it had to be a monster.

08:53.310 --> 08:54.680
What is that? 

08:54.680 --> 08:56.550
Rigby, you guys go get Skips.

08:56.550 --> 08:57.250
We'll pick you up. 

08:57.250 --> 08:58.150
Ok, ok.

08:58.150 --> 08:59.280
Pops, help me with this. 

08:59.280 --> 09:00.520
Let's go, let's go! 

09:04.290 --> 09:04.920
Come on! 

09:04.960 --> 09:05.690
Give me a break,

09:05.690 --> 09:07.060
I have to come up with the words you know.

09:07.990 --> 09:09.030
Ok, I got it.

09:09.230 --> 09:11.630
G-g-g-go away big monster go-go...

09:11.630 --> 09:13.230
No!

09:13.230 --> 09:14.130
What? 

09:14.830 --> 09:16.170
Dude, I think the batteries just died. 

09:16.170 --> 09:16.800
What?! 

09:19.000 --> 09:19.700
Hurry up dude! 

09:19.700 --> 09:20.810
The batteries are dead! 

09:20.810 --> 09:21.710
What?! 

09:23.270 --> 09:24.810
Hamboning will save your life someday,

09:24.880 --> 09:27.150
it'll be all like what, you're trying to mug me?

09:27.350 --> 09:28.410
I'm telling ya dude,

09:28.410 --> 09:30.820
hamboning.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.720
I know what to do!

09:31.820 --> 09:32.680
Hold this.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.350
Nooo! 

09:46.460 --> 09:48.870
HAMBONING! 

09:49.270 --> 09:50.900
I can't believe you just did that. 

09:54.240 --> 09:55.510
Use your keyboard! 

09:55.570 --> 09:56.710
The batteries are dead. 

10:02.050 --> 10:02.850
Play it! 

10:03.610 --> 10:06.180
TAKE US HOME!

10:16.060 --> 10:17.130
We did it!

10:18.860 --> 10:19.800
Hey, that's mine! 

10:19.800 --> 10:20.400
Nope,

10:20.400 --> 10:21.900
you sent him to the moon

10:21.900 --> 10:24.000
so the least you can do is give him your keyboard,

10:24.000 --> 10:24.870
right Skips?

10:24.870 --> 10:25.540
Right.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.940
And let's have it. 

10:28.940 --> 10:29.470
What? 

10:29.540 --> 10:32.010
THE 40 DOLLARS YOU TWO CONNED OUT OF ME

10:32.010 --> 10:34.080
WITH THAT STUPID KEYBOARD CRAP!

10:34.150 --> 10:35.780
I KNOW YOU STILL GOT IT!

10:35.780 --> 10:37.880
NOW GIVE IT BACK! 

10:41.350 --> 10:42.650
NOW CLEAN UP THIS MESS

10:42.650 --> 10:43.660
OR YOU'RE FIRED!

10:44.590 --> 10:45.920
Can you believe this?! 

10:46.060 --> 10:46.820
No!

10:48.060 --> 10:49.690
Dude this sucks!

10:49.990 --> 10:51.130
The hole's still there!

10:51.760 --> 10:53.430
Do you think Benson noticed it? 

10:56.770 --> 10:58.870
He won't now! 

10:58.870 --> 11:00.540
Dude, you're a genius!
