[instrumental music]

00:48.449 --> 00:50.684
[intense music]

00:51.819 --> 00:54.388
[thunder rumbling]

01:04.832 --> 01:06.367
(Master Wu)
'Right on time.'

01:06.400 --> 01:07.701
What!

01:07.735 --> 01:09.503
Long time no see.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.605
Master Wu?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.841
You look old.

01:13.874 --> 01:17.311
As if your best days
have passed.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.613
Not unlike your monastery.

01:19.647 --> 01:22.716
I still have
plenty of days left.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.186
Shall we finish what we started?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.355
I've been waiting decades.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.157
Really?

01:29.190 --> 01:31.859
It doesn't feel that long to me.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.862
This ends now.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.498
[intense music]

01:39.900 --> 01:45.173
(male narrator)
Episode 65.
"The Hands of Time".

01:45.206 --> 01:49.677
(Jay)
'This ends now, Samukai!'

01:49.710 --> 01:52.413
Nope, pretending this is
the actual Samukai

01:52.446 --> 01:55.316
doesn't make cleaning up
the museum anymore interesting.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.685
This is so lame.
We're ninja, not janitors.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.254
Come on, Jay,
we're all kinda responsible

02:00.288 --> 02:01.622
for the damage to the museum.

02:01.655 --> 02:05.326
After all, if we hadn't had
that massive battle

02:05.359 --> 02:07.228
on the Day of the Departed

02:07.261 --> 02:09.930
this place would still
be in one piece.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.167
Yeah, and whose fault
is that, Cole?

02:13.201 --> 02:16.604
Okay, how many more times do I
have to say I'm sorry for

02:16.637 --> 02:18.906
accidentally unleashing
the ghostly forces of evil

02:18.939 --> 02:20.208
that attacked Ninjago.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.675
How high can you count?

02:22.710 --> 02:23.911
[clattering]

02:23.944 --> 02:25.646
(Jay)
'A-and speaking of which'

02:25.679 --> 02:28.382
you still not used to having
your old non-ghost hands back?

02:28.416 --> 02:30.284
Well, I'm working on it.

02:35.656 --> 02:39.260
[grunting]
This is exhausting.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.628
If I could go back in time

02:40.661 --> 02:43.897
I'd tell Dr. Saunders
we were too busy to help.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.768
Nya, you may recall that the
rest of us once time travelled.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.938
It can have devastating effects
that should not be used lightly.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.207
Certainly,
not to get out of labor.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.744
It's just an expression, Zane.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.280
I, I don't believe it.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.314
What is that?

03:00.348 --> 03:02.650
I think it's a portrait of..

03:02.683 --> 03:04.218
...our parents.

03:05.653 --> 03:09.423
Whoa! This dates to when
I was like three years old.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.292
Surely before they disappeared.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.826
We know so little
about them, Nya.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.396
Father was
the Elemental Master of Fire.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.964
Mother was
the Master of Water.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.367
And they left us
the old blacksmith shop.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.001
And little else.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.636
They left us our powers.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.004
(Cole)
'Guys, look what I found.'

03:24.037 --> 03:25.506
splash

03:26.907 --> 03:29.477
[instrumental music]

03:31.745 --> 03:34.282
Uh, isn't that Garmadon?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.784
It is! Lloyd, that's your dad.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.686
And there's Master Wu.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.422
He looks so...young.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.425
Look at them,
my father and my uncle.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.761
Ninjago's two greatest
Elemental Masters.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.964
I wonder if I'll ever
live up to their legacy.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.367
First, Kai and Nya.
Now, Lloyd.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.536
It's family picture day
at the museum.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.738
Does anyone recognize
this battle?

03:57.771 --> 03:59.407
Pixal, analyze.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.443
(Pixal)
Facial contour mapping indicates

04:02.476 --> 04:04.878
this scene takes place
40 years ago

04:04.912 --> 04:06.614
during the Serpentine wars.

04:06.647 --> 04:10.384
During the Serpentine wars?
But Ninjago was at peace.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.286
Who would they be fighting?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.954
Refreshing time!

04:13.987 --> 04:17.024
Hot sweaty work deserves
a cool drink!

04:17.057 --> 04:19.827
Oh, thanks, Dr. Saunders.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.363
Enjoy the pickle day tea.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.032
[spluttering]

04:25.065 --> 04:29.470
Uh, oops. New hands, so clumsy.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.905
Eh.

04:31.939 --> 04:32.906
Mm.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.708
What's this painting?

04:34.742 --> 04:36.477
Oh, this? Nothing.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.847
Minor skirmish,
no historical significance.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.416
That is why I don't hang it
in the main gallery.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.753
It looks pretty significant
to me. This thing is huge.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.756
Yes, a huge myth.
The folklores.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.625
Even if it is a myth,
who are these men masters

04:51.659 --> 04:53.661
Wu and Garmadon
supposed to be fighting?

04:53.694 --> 04:55.329
'I have no data on them.'

04:55.363 --> 04:57.898
[sighs]
There is a legend.

04:57.931 --> 05:01.402
Twin brothers called
the Hands of Time.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.437
"The Hands of Time?"

05:03.471 --> 05:06.039
They could allegedly
manipulate time itself.

05:06.073 --> 05:09.843
Speed it up, slow it down.
All sorts of things.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.479
[laughs]

05:11.512 --> 05:14.081
See what I mean?
Manipulate time.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.117
A ridiculous fairy tale.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.552
Who's this one?

05:18.586 --> 05:21.088
Oh, this handsome
looking fellow? Hah.

05:21.121 --> 05:24.091
The legend says
his name is Crux.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.993
And who's the nasty looking guy?

05:26.026 --> 05:29.930
(Saunders)
'In the stories,
he's called Acronix.'

05:29.963 --> 05:31.799
[intense music]

05:33.867 --> 05:38.606
[grunts]
You might as well give up, Wu.
I'm the superior fighter.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.908
And your brother isn't here
to bail you out.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.911
No, but neither is yours,
Acronix.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.613
And whose fault is that?

05:45.646 --> 05:49.550
Garmadon and I did what we had
to do to protect Ninjago.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.820
And I will do what I have to do.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.954
Ha-yah!

05:53.987 --> 05:56.557
[both grunting]

05:57.725 --> 05:58.992
Huh-hah!

05:59.026 --> 06:00.428
Huh-yah!

06:05.433 --> 06:08.135
Huh. More spry
than I would expect.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.604
'Let's see if you can keep up.'

06:10.638 --> 06:11.872
Ha!

06:11.905 --> 06:14.408
Huh-yah!

06:17.177 --> 06:18.746
[grunting]

06:18.779 --> 06:21.749
Where do you want
this last one, Misako?

06:21.782 --> 06:24.752
(Misako)
'Anywhere you can find room.'

06:24.785 --> 06:27.187
Ronin, Dareth,
thank you again

06:27.220 --> 06:29.623
for helping me set
up our new Ninja Temple.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.626
- Ha-ha, happy to do it.
- Do what?

06:32.660 --> 06:34.595
Three hundred boxes
airlifted into this place

06:34.628 --> 06:36.163
and you didn't carry
a single one of 'em.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.165
I told ya, I got a bad back.

06:38.198 --> 06:43.571
Besides, this unpacking
isn't gonna supervise itself.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.740
Oh, this came
to the wrong place.

06:46.774 --> 06:50.678
[gasps]
Sweet swordfighter!
Get a load of that thing.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.980
Nya's samurai suit.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.749
This should've gone
to her Samurai X cave.

06:55.783 --> 06:56.650
What for?

06:56.684 --> 06:58.486
I thought she gave up
being Samurai X

06:58.519 --> 06:59.953
for the Water Ninja?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.221
Hm, she did.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.656
But she kept the mech

07:02.690 --> 07:04.658
so I'm sure she'd want this too.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.795
If nothing else, it's
a souvenir of her past life.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.798
If it were me, I'd sell the
whole kit and caboodle online.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.533
One of a kind tech like that

07:12.566 --> 07:14.535
some collector would
pay a fortune.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.936
With that kinda cheese,
she could buy

07:15.969 --> 07:17.671
'all the souvenirs
she ever wanted.'

07:17.705 --> 07:19.607
Fill the place with snow globes.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.043
Huh, tell me I'd be happy
to broker a deal

07:23.076 --> 07:24.512
for a small fee, of course.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.813
Sell it?

07:25.846 --> 07:30.618
This baby belongs
in a museum. Or my dojo.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.886
Huh-hah! Huh-hah-yah!

07:32.920 --> 07:36.990
Look out, Ninjago,
here comes Samurai D.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.059
- Uh..
- Huh?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.028
Samurai D.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.095
[grunts]

07:43.163 --> 07:45.533
The D is for Dareth.

07:49.703 --> 07:53.240
Give it up, old man.
I've got decades on you!

07:53.273 --> 07:55.876
I'm faster, stronger!

07:55.909 --> 07:57.578
That's your mistake.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.980
You assume your youth
is a greater weapon

08:00.013 --> 08:02.616
than my experience.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.085
[grunting]

08:12.159 --> 08:15.596
Arrogant to the finish,
just like your brother.

08:15.629 --> 08:19.299
Arrogant? No, confident!

08:19.332 --> 08:21.969
[grunting]

08:26.173 --> 08:29.009
[grunting]

08:29.042 --> 08:30.177
Arrogant.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.179
It was Crux's downfall

08:32.212 --> 08:34.314
and now it's yours.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.883
Do you yield?

08:36.316 --> 08:37.618
Never.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.588
There's no escape
this time, Acronix.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.155
[screams]

08:42.189 --> 08:44.892
Do you yield?

08:46.259 --> 08:48.862
I...yield.

08:48.896 --> 08:52.232
So, 40 years after it began

08:52.265 --> 08:54.301
the battle
of the Elemental Masters

08:54.334 --> 08:55.969
versus the Hands of Time

08:56.003 --> 09:01.141
finally ended
at precisely 6:00 p.m.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.744
[thunder rumbling]

09:08.081 --> 09:09.650
[rumbling]

09:11.652 --> 09:13.721
Dareth,
please give me that back.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.656
Oh, allow..

09:15.689 --> 09:17.791
- Oh! Oh, my back! My back!
- Me?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.927
When did I get on top of Dareth?

09:22.195 --> 09:24.598
- 6:00 p.m.
- Quittin' time.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.335
[breathing heavily]

09:28.368 --> 09:31.905
W-what just happened?
Time just..

09:31.939 --> 09:34.074
Moved forward?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.609
Argh!

09:38.846 --> 09:43.717
And at 6:01,
the battle began again.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.186
[instrumental music]

09:52.259 --> 09:53.961
How did I get this?

09:53.994 --> 09:56.697
I have the strangest feeling.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.767
It's like deja vu,
but in reverse.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.803
It's like time skipped a beat.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.338
No, it skipped an entire minute.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.841
Please, get off of me!

10:07.875 --> 10:10.678
Um, weren't we just outside?

10:10.711 --> 10:12.846
- When did we get here?
- How did we get here?

10:12.880 --> 10:15.415
My circuits are picking up
an energy displacement.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.685
There was a displacement,
alright.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.252
It displaced us right in here.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.255
What is going on?

10:22.289 --> 10:25.358
I don't know but it's loud!

10:25.392 --> 10:27.227
[thunder rumbling]

10:29.362 --> 10:31.264
[grunting]

10:31.298 --> 10:34.234
You had your chance, old man.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.936
You should've let me drop.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.137
[laughs]

10:37.170 --> 10:40.273
Now, let's see
if your experience

10:40.307 --> 10:42.275
is more powerful than..

10:44.444 --> 10:46.646
...the Time Blade!

10:49.316 --> 10:52.419
These energy readings
are off the charts!

10:52.452 --> 10:53.887
Where is it coming from?

10:53.921 --> 10:56.423
I'm trying
to pinpoint the location.

10:56.456 --> 11:00.694
How about pinpointing the
location of the "off" button?

11:00.728 --> 11:02.830
These alarms are giving me a..

11:03.831 --> 11:07.735
Hey, ha-ha, thank you.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.169
Hm, this is surprising.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.772
No, it's not, I've always
had sensitive ears and--

11:11.805 --> 11:13.240
I meant, I think I know

11:13.273 --> 11:15.876
how we suddenly appeared
on the Destiny's Bounty.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.877
How?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.311
The displacement we experienced

11:18.345 --> 11:21.348
was not caused by just
any normal energy.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.816
It was temporal energy.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.785
Oh, well, temporal energy.

11:24.818 --> 11:29.122
Uh, of course, everyone knows
that's, uh, powerful.

11:29.156 --> 11:32.492
You have no idea what
temporal means, do you?

11:32.525 --> 11:35.062
- I do not.
- It means time.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.129
Precisely,.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.131
Whatever created
that displacement

11:38.165 --> 11:40.768
can work the very fabric
of space-time.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.036
Which is powerful, right?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.104
Very.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.807
All the normal rules
of existence no longer apply

11:46.840 --> 11:47.908
to such a force.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.277
Told you it was powerful.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.112
Argh!

11:52.145 --> 11:53.713
[grunting]

11:56.383 --> 12:00.220
That's right. Flee, Master Wu.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.125
Master, hah!

12:05.158 --> 12:09.196
To think my brother
and I ever took orders from you!

12:13.233 --> 12:17.370
Weak, afraid,
lacking any ambition.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.840
Your only ambition was to rule.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.043
Because Crux and I
deserved to rule.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.845
Do you recall what we said

12:24.878 --> 12:28.181
on this very ground
40 years ago?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.383
Control time.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.119
Control everything.

12:32.152 --> 12:35.055
Excellent memory, old man.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.125
And look who controls time
again.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.094
Just need a moment
for my Time Blade to recharge.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.298
[grunting]

12:50.537 --> 12:52.039
[groans]

12:55.608 --> 12:57.077
Gone?

13:01.915 --> 13:04.451
[instrumental music]

13:04.484 --> 13:07.254
It ends now, Acronix.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.389
It certainly does.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.427
Huh-yah!

13:14.461 --> 13:16.263
No, no, no.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.465
I'm not there now.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.801
That's where I was, then.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.453
You know what that means.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.923
I'll see you in just..

13:44.424 --> 13:45.392
...a moment!

13:46.193 --> 13:47.961
Yah!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.334
Control time.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.437
'Control everything.'

13:57.470 --> 14:01.208
[sighs]
Okay, yes. There was
a little hiccup in time.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.376
But just one.
I'm sure it was nothing.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.914
They probably happen all the
time, and we don't realize it.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.382
You know, like deja vu.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.051
Can we go home now?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.419
- Hm.
- Hm?

14:12.452 --> 14:15.455
Seriously, we just cleaned
up an entire museum!

14:15.488 --> 14:17.024
Aren't you guys tired?

14:17.057 --> 14:19.326
- Well..
- Well?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.594
(Pixal)
I've located
the surge's epicenter.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.196
Where, Pixal?

14:24.331 --> 14:25.999
The old monastery.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.102
The monastery?
That place totally burned down.

14:29.136 --> 14:32.039
Why would anyone
or anything be up there?

14:32.072 --> 14:33.373
We should find out.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.109
Oh, why? Cole's right.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.645
There's no reason for anyone
to be up at the monastery.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.081
Zane's probably malfunctioning.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.052
Self diagnostic
indicates negative.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.387
- How about now?
- No.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.090
I agree with Lloyd,
we should go.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.225
Where there's smoke
there's usually fire.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.661
And where there is
massive energy displacement

14:54.694 --> 14:56.129
there's usually trouble.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.431
Well, maybe, it's like,
you know, uh..

14:58.465 --> 15:01.401
...a harmless
massive energy displacement.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.403
[laughs]

15:03.436 --> 15:06.406
Come on, seriously,
I'm exhausted!

15:06.439 --> 15:08.541
We did our good deed
for the day.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.079
Wait, Master Wu said
he was going to the monastery.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.182
Something about
finishing an old fight.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.951
He said this was something
he should do alone.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.352
[sighs]

15:19.386 --> 15:23.356
What are you waiting for?
Get us to the monastery!

15:23.390 --> 15:26.026
[intense music]

15:32.732 --> 15:36.403
Ouch! That last hit hurt,
didn't it?

15:36.436 --> 15:39.106
The blade gives it
a little extra kick.

15:39.139 --> 15:43.243
I think I'm gonna call
that one the "Time Punch".

15:43.276 --> 15:46.713
'And its effects
are devastating.'

15:46.746 --> 15:50.517
I...I made a mistake.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.221
Yes, you did. You never
should have challenged me.

15:54.254 --> 15:58.291
Not 40 years ago.
Not today.

15:58.325 --> 16:01.194
Don't worry, I can be merciful.

16:01.228 --> 16:05.132
I figure, one more charge,
one more Time Punch

16:05.165 --> 16:08.568
and it'll all be over fast.

16:08.601 --> 16:12.705
How I wish my brother were here
to see this.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.474
Me too.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.244
Ninja-go!

16:19.046 --> 16:20.180
thud

16:23.283 --> 16:24.384
Aah!

16:27.520 --> 16:29.156
[groans]

16:30.223 --> 16:31.758
Hm, you know what they say

16:31.791 --> 16:35.695
"If the Time Punch doesn't get
ya, the fall will."

16:35.728 --> 16:38.431
Actually, no one says that,
but they should.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.666
Farewell.

16:39.699 --> 16:43.736
I'd like to stay till the end,
but I have somewhere to be.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.639
[instrumental music]

16:46.673 --> 16:48.241
I don't believe it.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.743
The legendary Destiny's Bounty.

16:50.777 --> 16:54.514
What is a 200-year-old
flying pirate ship doing here?

16:54.547 --> 16:58.685
Now, this has been
a strange day.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.687
Hey, has anyone seen, Master Wu?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.789
Hm, I only see that guy.

17:02.822 --> 17:03.823
Who's that?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.126
I don't know. Let's find out.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.162
No, no, wait. What if, uh..
Hey, hey!

17:09.196 --> 17:10.530
[rattling]

17:10.563 --> 17:13.166
Ahem. Excuse me.
I'm looking for someone.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.135
That's no pirate.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.836
What's he doing?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.605
Who do you seek, ninja?

17:18.638 --> 17:21.241
Spinjitsu master,
about ye tall, long beard.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.576
- Goes by the name, Wu.
- Haven't seen him.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.379
Hm, that's odd,
'cause judging by

17:26.413 --> 17:28.148
all the slash marks around here

17:28.181 --> 17:29.716
I think you have.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.384
Jay just pulled his nunchuks.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.686
Nya, you better get us
down there, fast!

17:33.720 --> 17:36.623
Not gonna work, there's not
enough room down there.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.458
It's just one guy.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.794
I'm sure Jay can handle,
uh, whoever that is.

17:41.828 --> 17:42.862
Pixal!

17:42.895 --> 17:45.298
(Pixal)
'Scanning.'

17:45.332 --> 17:46.633
'It appears to be--"

17:46.666 --> 17:48.468
[gasps]
Acronix!

17:48.501 --> 17:52.272
Acronix as in, Acronix and Crux,
The Hands of Time?

17:52.305 --> 17:53.506
From the painting?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.875
But Dr. Saunders says
that battle wasn't real.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.611
Even if it was,
it was 40 years ago.

17:58.645 --> 18:02.182
Acronix would be
an old man today like Master Wu.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.750
But that guy
down there is young.

18:03.783 --> 18:07.887
But that's impossible!
Unless, he time travelled?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.357
We have to get down there. Now!

18:11.258 --> 18:13.693
[intense music]

18:17.664 --> 18:19.432
[crackling]

18:26.639 --> 18:29.476
A moment ago,
I had no quarrel with you.

18:29.509 --> 18:33.213
Unfortunately,
for you, I do now.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.248
[music continues]

18:36.383 --> 18:38.485
[grunts]
Did you see that? It's like--

18:38.518 --> 18:40.187
He jumped forward in time.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.522
Yeah? Let's see him jump this.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.428
[grunting]

18:51.398 --> 18:54.201
More ninja? Curious.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.603
(all)
Ninja-go!

19:00.673 --> 19:02.642
[groaning]

19:02.675 --> 19:06.579
You only missed me
by a few seconds.

19:06.613 --> 19:12.785
Oh, sometimes I wish I was still
Samurai X instead of a ninja.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.787
[grunting]

19:18.558 --> 19:21.694
You're fast,
but faster than this?

19:24.664 --> 19:29.436
Elemental Master of Fire, I've
encountered one of you before.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.771
You've met my father?

19:36.309 --> 19:37.744
There he is.

19:37.777 --> 19:42.415
Ninja...come out and play.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.817
Jay, Cole, Kai.
We get Acronix.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.721
Zayne, Nya, use your elemental
powers to put out this fire.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.524
Ninja...come out and play.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.493
Hang on, who put you in charge?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.495
Why can't I help
with the flames?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.896
You think lightning
is better than

19:56.929 --> 19:58.931
water and ice
for stopping flames?

19:58.965 --> 20:01.268
Good point. Let's go!

20:03.670 --> 20:05.838
[intense music]

20:05.872 --> 20:08.441
You got lucky last time. Aah!

20:12.512 --> 20:16.316
Clumsy, like a fawn
standing on her new legs.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.684
- One!
- Two!

20:17.717 --> 20:18.818
Three!

20:23.423 --> 20:25.858
[music continues]

20:35.335 --> 20:36.969
Yes, keep moving him back!

20:37.003 --> 20:38.471
He's gonna have to surrender

20:38.505 --> 20:40.607
or else the flames
are gonna get him.

20:41.341 --> 20:44.411
Here's Acronix!

20:45.612 --> 20:46.813
[zapping]

20:48.881 --> 20:50.817
(Dareth)
It's gonna blow!

21:02.662 --> 21:05.632
[sighs]
Burned down again?

21:05.665 --> 21:08.668
Man, this place just
cannot catch a break.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.572
Neither did Acronix.

21:12.605 --> 21:16.609
Good,. You know me, I don't back
down from a challenge.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.478
But I wouldn't wanna face
that guy again.

21:18.511 --> 21:22.048
No way! He moved at,
like, the speed of time.

21:22.081 --> 21:25.051
Come on, guys, let's get back
to the Destiny's Bounty.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.554
But what about Master Wu?

21:27.587 --> 21:30.857
Ah! We gotta find him.
Spread out!

21:32.392 --> 21:34.827
[intense music]

21:37.697 --> 21:40.299
[screaming]

21:41.668 --> 21:45.071
[grunting]
Gotta hang on.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.807
[groaning]

21:47.840 --> 21:49.442
[panting]

21:50.810 --> 21:52.845
Barely made it.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.848
Master, are you alright?

21:55.882 --> 21:59.819
I...fear not.

21:59.852 --> 22:00.920
Why was Acronix here?

22:00.953 --> 22:06.025
- How did he do that?
- Why were you fighting him?

22:06.058 --> 22:09.362
There is much to tell you

22:09.396 --> 22:12.632
and not much time.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.403
[clock ticking]

22:17.470 --> 22:19.572
Where have you been?

22:19.606 --> 22:22.609
Sorry, I'm late.
Ninja trouble.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.912
Things have changed
since I was last in Ninjago.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.458
Indeed, they have..

22:38.491 --> 22:39.792
...brother.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.564
[theme music]
