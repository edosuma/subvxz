00:29.079 --> 00:32.173
- Yes, sir. Where to?
- It's the train to Chicago. The Silver Streak.

00:32.173 --> 00:34.979
- Silver Streak. I'll take care of your bags, sir.
- Thank you.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.613
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thanks

00:49.499 --> 00:52.366
What are those conventioneers
doing up at the baggage car?

00:53.536 --> 00:55.265
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Now, ain't that somethin'?

00:55.265 --> 00:57.772
I thought it was bad enough with the
hippies on board. Now we got their fathers.

01:01.211 --> 01:03.270
Oh, we had to get Mary Lou.

01:03.270 --> 01:07.339
- She's our date for the party.
- Come on, Conductor! Let's get this show on the track!

01:07.339 --> 01:09.281
Oh, ho, ho.
I beg your pardon, sir.

01:10.186 --> 01:12.780
Hello. Am I in the right place?

01:12.780 --> 01:15.825
First class. Yes, sir.
Right this way.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.553
Watch your step there.

01:29.638 --> 01:31.697
- This is your room here, sir.
- Okay, thanks a lot.

01:31.697 --> 01:33.434
- Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant trip.
- Bye-bye.

01:33.434 --> 01:38.241
Sir, you think you're gonna be needin'
all these bags up here? If not, I can store
some of'em down at the other end.

01:38.241 --> 01:41.111
- Sure, sure. All I need is this one and that one.
- Okay.

01:41.111 --> 01:43.082
- You can take this. I'll keep the briefcase.
- I'll take that.

01:44.482 --> 01:47.181
- Is this the bed?
- Yeah. I'll be makin' that up a little later on.

01:47.181 --> 01:49.087
Okay, thanks.

01:49.087 --> 01:52.320
- And this is...
- Your lavatory and sink, sir.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.056
- Nice, big room.
- Very convenient.

01:55.056 --> 01:58.394
- What's this partition?
- Oh, that turns the room into a double suite..

01:58.394 --> 02:01.526
We used to have a lot of calls for 'em...
from the honeymooners.

02:01.526 --> 02:03.229
I'm sorry.

02:03.229 --> 02:07.172
I'm not doing it on purpose.
This latch seems to be stuck.

02:08.876 --> 02:10.537
Everything's changed.
Did you say something?

02:10.979 --> 02:15.176
No! No. I-I agree with everything you said.
All I wanna do is take it easy.

02:15.176 --> 02:18.412
Good, good. Then just settle back
and enjoy the trip.

02:18.412 --> 02:22.047
Because it ain't gonna be too exciting,
now, but we'll get you there on time.

02:22.047 --> 02:23.818
- Okay. Have a nice rest.
- Thanks a lot.

02:23.818 --> 02:25.825
- Bye-bye.
- Good evening.

02:29.830 --> 02:31.660
Board!

03:31.790 --> 03:34.816
So long, L.A.! Bye!

03:56.381 --> 03:58.576
Do you like this perfume?

03:58.576 --> 04:00.583
I mix it myself.

04:02.854 --> 04:05.846
Lovely. Very nice.

04:15.699 --> 04:17.690
That's something, huh?
Yes, sir.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.963
We leave Los Angeles,

04:19.963 --> 04:23.006
and we go right up there to Nevada...

04:23.006 --> 04:25.598
into Colorado, across the Rockies...

04:25.598 --> 04:28.041
up to Kansas City, Kansas.

04:28.041 --> 04:31.308
Right in here's a town
called Ashland, Missouri.

04:31.308 --> 04:36.080
Cross the big Mississippi.
Two and a half days, right up
there in Chicago, Illinois.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.121
- That's some trip, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

04:38.121 --> 04:39.917
- You from Chicago?
- No, Los Angeles.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.015
I'm from Chicago.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.753
My name is Bob Sweet.

04:43.753 --> 04:46.887
A sweet man, but a mean baby.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.624
- George Caldwell.
- Yeah?

04:49.698 --> 04:52.258
Yeah, George,
what racket you in?

04:52.258 --> 04:55.599
- Publishing.
- No kidding? Come on. Sit down here.
- Thanks.

04:55.599 --> 04:58.401
You know, I'm in vitamins myself.

04:59.809 --> 05:02.744
Mm-hmm. Here.
There's a sample for ya. Vitamin "E."

05:02.744 --> 05:05.042
Now, that is great
for the old pecker.

05:07.716 --> 05:10.412
Yeah, it really keeps
the pencil sharp, and I'm not kiddin'.

05:10.412 --> 05:14.252
Have you had a chance yet
to check out the action?

05:14.252 --> 05:17.315
No. Actually, this is the first time
I've ever taken a train.

05:18.394 --> 05:20.328
- You're kidding me?
- No.

05:20.328 --> 05:21.048
Come on

05:22.398 --> 05:24.865
- Well, you're in for the ride of your life.
- Oh, yeah?

05:25.934 --> 05:29.961
You just pick out a little chickie, my friend...
and it's hug and munch all the way to Chicago.

05:31.272 --> 05:33.263
- Really?
- I do it all the time.

05:33.263 --> 05:38.210
I tell my boss that I'm afraid of flying...
and I get this action twice a year.

05:39.180 --> 05:41.705
It's a cathouse on wheels.

05:41.705 --> 05:43.876
No... Hey, listen.
Come on.

05:43.876 --> 05:48.651
It's something about the movement
of the train that does it.
All that motion makes a girl horny.

05:50.125 --> 05:53.891
Well, I'll tell you, Bob. I'm not really
interested in a shipboard romance.

05:53.891 --> 05:56.522
- I took the train to rest and get a lot
of reading done.
- Hold it, hold it.

05:56.522 --> 06:01.394
Right there, George.
I believe I see my chickie for tonight.

06:04.438 --> 06:07.771
Hi, there. Can I, uh,
buy you a drink?

06:08.609 --> 06:12.568
- I have one. Thank you.
- Well, I'll just, uh, join you then, huh?

06:12.568 --> 06:14.739
That's an old-fashioned, bartender.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.079
- You go all the way?
- What?

06:27.161 --> 06:30.597
I said, do you go all the way...
to Chicago?

06:32.466 --> 06:35.059
Oh. Yes, I do.

06:40.339 --> 06:43.137
- Well, then maybe we can do it together.
- Do what?

06:44.010 --> 06:48.140
- Go to Chicago.
I mean, you know, we're gonna be, uh...

06:48.140 --> 06:51.274
stuck on this train together,

06:51.274 --> 06:53.250
and we can't jump off.

06:55.755 --> 06:57.848
Do you feel that motion?

07:05.064 --> 07:06.964
Are you hot?

07:06.964 --> 07:07.684
What?

07:09.267 --> 07:11.235
I said, are you hot?

07:13.872 --> 07:16.568
Lady, I am always hot.

07:18.410 --> 07:20.708
Maybe I can cool you down.

08:08.259 --> 08:11.922
How's the latch? May I?

08:11.922 --> 08:14.021
Yes. Please, sit down.

08:15.065 --> 08:17.158
What a nice surprise.

08:18.234 --> 08:22.000
I said, how's the latch?
We have connecting rooms.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.904
The latch. Good.
It's good. It's fine. Thank you.

08:24.904 --> 08:29.206
It's a little bit rusty, but nothing serious.
I'll get the porter to look at it.

08:30.179 --> 08:32.703
There's no rush, is there?

08:36.085 --> 08:37.881
Would you folks like a cocktail?

08:38.955 --> 08:41.515
Uh, a martini on the rocks
with a twist.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.784
- Two.
- Yes, sir.

08:48.631 --> 08:52.532
- My name is George Caldwell.
- Hilly Burns.

08:53.702 --> 08:57.968
That's short for Hildegard.
What's that pencil for?

08:57.968 --> 09:01.567
Oh, you have to fill out
your own menu card.

09:04.012 --> 09:08.381
"One macedoine of fruit,
beef Oriental, rice, carrots...

09:08.381 --> 09:11.078
coffee, apple pie a la mode. "

09:12.154 --> 09:13.644
You print very well.

09:15.490 --> 09:16.479
Thanks.

09:17.492 --> 09:20.222
I'll have the same thing.
You do it for me.

09:23.498 --> 09:25.728
I can't even read my own writing.

09:25.728 --> 09:28.928
I don't do shorthand,
and I can't type.

09:28.928 --> 09:30.994
What do you do for a living?

09:30.994 --> 09:32.903
I'm a secretary.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.076
- Well, how do you keep your job?
- I give great phone.

09:40.381 --> 09:42.042
I have a terrific personality.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.815
- You going to Chicago?
- Yes.

09:46.815 --> 09:49.651
I'm going to my sister's wedding.

09:49.651 --> 09:52.090
How come you're taking the train?
You afraid of flying?

09:52.090 --> 09:55.526
No, I'm not afraid of flying.

09:55.526 --> 09:59.862
I, uh... I just want to be bored.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.230
And you?

10:05.230 --> 10:09.537
Oh, my new boss
likes the old-fashioned ways.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.108
He's just written a book
on Rembrandt...

10:13.108 --> 10:16.376
and he's gonna kick off his publicity
campaign with a lecture at the Art Institute.

10:16.376 --> 10:18.747
Oh, yes? I'm in publishing.
What's his name?

10:18.747 --> 10:21.252
Professor Arthur Schreiner.
Have you heard of him?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.654
Most people haven't.

10:25.654 --> 10:29.593
He's, um... He's been a recluse
working on this book for about  20  years.

10:29.593 --> 10:32.153
- Where is he now?
- Oh, he's in bed...

10:32.153 --> 10:35.599
with a glass of hot milk and molasses.
He's a health nut.

10:35.599 --> 10:39.159
- What do you publish?
- Oh, mostly nonfiction.

10:39.159 --> 10:42.298
Gardening, cook books,
how-to-do-it books.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.800
Like sex manuals?

10:47.179 --> 10:50.671
- I've edited a few.
- An authority, huh?

10:52.451 --> 10:55.750
I know what goes where...
and why.

10:58.257 --> 11:01.454
- That's very interesting. Are you married?
- Divorced.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.089
How come?

11:09.935 --> 11:12.494
My friends all told me that
my wife was too good for me...

11:12.494 --> 11:15.562
and after a couple of years
I decided they were right.

11:16.908 --> 11:18.375
Sounds sad.

11:20.244 --> 11:24.442
You say that your boss is in art history.
Is that what you're interested in?

11:25.516 --> 11:27.916
Not really.

11:27.916 --> 11:31.477
just got this job because
I was available. I was willing to travel.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.893
- Would you like some wine with this meal?
- Oh, what a question.

11:39.497 --> 11:43.126
Um, we'll have a bottle
of the Mouton Cadet.

11:46.503 --> 11:47.993
Very good, sir.

11:49.639 --> 11:53.234
- You do that very well.
- I give great French.

12:18.802 --> 12:21.099
- He'll never talk.
- We gotta find those papers.

12:21.099 --> 12:22.603
Come on.
We'll look in his compartment.

12:26.609 --> 12:29.476
So that was your introduction
to high society?

12:31.180 --> 12:33.648
Look, he was very good to me.

12:33.648 --> 12:36.708
He taught me everything
from the pill to Picasso.

12:37.520 --> 12:41.047
- What was missing?
- A marriage license.

12:41.924 --> 12:43.448
Is that what you want?

12:45.227 --> 12:47.161
I did then.

12:48.497 --> 12:50.397
Right now, I'd like some more
champagne.

12:56.871 --> 13:00.034
- Uh-oh. Shall I get another bottle?
- Two.

13:04.112 --> 13:06.774
This place seems to be closing down.

13:09.050 --> 13:12.076
Why don't we take our glasses...

13:12.076 --> 13:14.621
and go to our rooms?

13:18.760 --> 13:21.058
We could even open
the connecting door.

13:22.297 --> 13:24.231
We could even break down
the whole partition.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.726
- I'll speak to the porter.
- I'll get the champagne.

13:44.851 --> 13:46.944
You were right.
It's that motion.

13:46.944 --> 13:49.352
I didn't understand it,
but you were right.

13:52.326 --> 13:53.657
Good night.

14:10.209 --> 14:11.699
- Rapist!
- No, no, no, no!

14:12.260 --> 14:14.760
Pardonez-moi, por favor.

14:31.697 --> 14:33.221
Excuse me.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.995
Um, this won't take a minute.

14:36.936 --> 14:38.426
Good.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.806
Excellent. These are all right.

14:41.806 --> 14:43.306
Sorry. Good evening.

14:54.619 --> 14:55.339
Come in.

15:04.229 --> 15:06.390
This is very nice.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.425
- Would you like some champagne?
- Yes.

15:10.425 --> 15:13.834
I can't get over the size of this room
without the partition.

15:14.838 --> 15:20.043
They are small rooms by themselves.
They're perfect forjuggling.

15:20.043 --> 15:21.507
- For what?
- For juggling.

15:21.507 --> 15:24.410
When you practice, the balls would
always bounce off the walls.

15:26.682 --> 15:28.741
Do you juggle a lot?

15:30.019 --> 15:32.078
I know what goes where and why.

15:40.063 --> 15:42.054
I like that song.

15:43.332 --> 15:47.701
If I ever hear it again...
it'll be difficult not to think of you.

15:49.371 --> 15:52.863
- You put that very nicely.
- Thanks.

16:02.217 --> 16:04.947
To traveling by train.

16:04.947 --> 16:07.386
Trains that pass in the night.

16:26.574 --> 16:28.439
You like my new shoes?

16:28.439 --> 16:31.706
- Yes, I do.
- Why don't you take them off?

16:31.706 --> 16:35.909
You can put them in that little locker over there...
and the porter will have them shined for you
in the morning.

16:35.909 --> 16:38.975
- Really?
- That's terrific.

16:44.425 --> 16:46.416
- Is that the master's work?
- Mm-hmm.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.123
He gave me this copy
for safe keeping.

16:52.133 --> 16:53.828
Do you want to read it?

17:26.098 --> 17:27.760
Slide over.

17:33.572 --> 17:35.563
It's beautiful, isn't it?

17:36.575 --> 17:38.236
Very.

17:53.559 --> 17:56.392
Do you really edit sex manuals?

17:57.529 --> 18:00.191
I really, really do.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.661
But I have a confession to make.

18:04.736 --> 18:07.932
I'm much better
at books on gardening.

18:07.932 --> 18:10.997
- Really?
- That's my specialty.

18:13.511 --> 18:15.172
Well...

18:16.547 --> 18:20.574
is there anything that
you might wanna pass on?

18:22.820 --> 18:25.516
- You mean about gardening?
- Yes.

18:26.324 --> 18:30.158
Some helpful hints
for the beginner.

18:31.662 --> 18:33.323
Well...

18:35.600 --> 18:37.659
One tip is...

18:38.736 --> 18:41.670
always be nasty to nasturtiums.

18:43.106 --> 18:45.336
- Is that so?
- They love that.

18:45.336 --> 18:48.707
- They like it rough?
- The rougher, the better.

18:48.707 --> 18:50.370
Great.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.318
What else should I know?

18:57.687 --> 19:00.656
I could teach you the secret
of how to treat azaleas.

19:00.656 --> 19:02.783
Oh, tell me.
I'm all ears.

19:02.783 --> 19:05.157
I can see that.

19:05.157 --> 19:06.752
Well...

19:07.631 --> 19:11.089
just treat them the same way
as you would a begonia.

19:11.089 --> 19:14.762
- No kidding?
- That's gospel.

19:14.762 --> 19:18.568
You mean what you're saying is what's
good for azaleas is good for begonias?

19:18.568 --> 19:22.407
- You got it.
- George, this is fascinating.

19:22.407 --> 19:24.912
I thought you'd be interested.

19:24.912 --> 19:27.642
I'd like to delve deeper.

19:27.642 --> 19:30.617
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

19:44.767 --> 19:48.931
What would happen if you treated
an azalea like a nasturtium?

19:51.039 --> 19:54.031
Now, this is the really interesting part.

20:05.320 --> 20:08.118
- What is it, George?
- Did you see it? Did you see that man?

20:08.118 --> 20:11.556
- What man?
- There was a man
hanging outside this window.

20:11.556 --> 20:14.390
- He was shot in the head.
- What?

20:14.390 --> 20:18.159
Hilly, a dead man
fell off the roof.

20:18.159 --> 20:21.963
I saw it. His coat was stuck.

20:26.540 --> 20:29.373
Oh. I should do something.

20:29.373 --> 20:32.537
I should report it.
Maybe they could stop the train.

20:32.537 --> 20:35.513
George, I'm sure
you saw something.

20:35.513 --> 20:39.109
You probably saw a kid's kite
or an old newspaper out...

20:39.109 --> 20:43.520
Look! Like that. You see, George,
it could have been anything out there.

20:44.758 --> 20:47.192
But his eyes were so clear.

20:48.261 --> 20:50.695
I think they were clearer
than your head.

20:50.695 --> 20:53.528
- You imagined this, George.
- I didn't. I know I didn't.

20:53.528 --> 20:56.660
Then why don't you call the conductor
and tell him your story?

20:58.672 --> 21:01.970
- I feel dizzy.
- You know what? Here.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.032
Lie down here, George.

21:07.079 --> 21:10.378
Whew! If this is what
the D.T. S are like...

21:10.378 --> 21:13.646
I'm gonna give up
the bottle for life.

21:13.646 --> 21:19.021
The mind plays funny tricks
on you all the time.

21:19.021 --> 21:23.824
You know that, George.
Come on. Relax. It's okay. Relax

21:25.931 --> 21:28.422
That sure is a pretty song.

21:29.135 --> 21:31.069
Yes, it is.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.800
You're very beautiful, Hilly.

21:41.446 --> 21:43.277
I like you too, George.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.349
Hilly, wake up.

23:05.895 --> 23:07.226
Hi, George.

23:07.226 --> 23:12.233
Hilly, the man that I saw outside
the window last night... this is him.

23:12.233 --> 23:16.533
- That's my boss. That's Professor Schreiner.
- I know it. That's what I'm talking about.

23:16.533 --> 23:18.540
- What time is it, George?
- It's just after 8:00.

23:18.540 --> 23:22.703
8:00? Oh, no. Wake me up again
when it's after 10:00.

23:22.703 --> 23:24.335
Hilly, this man
has been murdered.

23:26.515 --> 23:27.846
- Well...

23:28.917 --> 23:32.910
Why don't you go down the hall
and discuss it with him?

23:32.910 --> 23:35.115
And then come back here
and discuss it with me.

23:35.115 --> 23:38.591
He's just right past
the diner, room "C."

23:38.591 --> 23:40.184
Hilly, I didn't imagine it.

23:41.329 --> 23:44.924
Good night, George.
You're a wonderful gardener.

24:16.697 --> 24:18.289
- Rapist.
- Oh!

24:19.833 --> 24:23.599
Hey, George, you devil.
Come on. Join me for coffee.

24:23.599 --> 24:27.334
All right. I'll be right back.
I just have to check on something.

24:31.210 --> 24:32.302
What is that?

24:47.427 --> 24:49.452
Yeah? What do you want?

24:49.452 --> 24:51.997
I'd like to see
Professor Schreiner, please.

24:51.997 --> 24:56.559
- Yeah? Who are you?
- My name is George Caldwell.

24:56.559 --> 24:58.570
You a friend of the professor?

24:58.570 --> 25:02.506
No, not exactly. I'm a friend of his secretary's.
We were a little worried about him.

25:03.208 --> 25:05.438
Yeah? What are you worried about?

25:06.845 --> 25:09.109
Can't I talk to the professor?

25:11.750 --> 25:13.308
What are you doing in there?

25:13.308 --> 25:15.819
I think you're sticking your nose in
where it don't belong.

25:15.819 --> 25:18.185
You and that broad are gonna
get yourself in trouble.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.520
In fact, she's already in trouble

25:20.520 --> 25:23.152
- You're the one who's in trouble,
mister, not me.
- Reace!

25:23.152 --> 25:25.423
Get rid of this bum.

25:26.898 --> 25:28.832
What are you doing?
Who is that?

25:28.832 --> 25:33.360
Hey! Listen, you big lummox,
let me go! What the hell are you doing?

25:33.360 --> 25:36.805
Are you crazy?
What the hell's the matter with you?

25:36.805 --> 25:40.002
All right, listen, buster, you're in trouble...
and I mean big trouble,

25:40.002 --> 25:41.738
because I'm reporting you.

25:43.147 --> 25:46.514
Oh, no, you can't be serious.
Wait a minute. All right. Enough's enough.

25:46.514 --> 25:49.781
If you're willing to forget it...
I don't believe this! Are you kidding?

26:03.100 --> 26:04.692
Goddamn it!

26:05.736 --> 26:07.995
Son of a bitch!

26:49.578 --> 26:51.239
This is terrific!

28:03.383 --> 28:07.979
- If that's you, Pepe, you're in one heap of trouble.
- No, it's not Pepe.

28:07.979 --> 28:11.353
- Where's Pepe?
- I don't know. My name is George...

28:11.353 --> 28:14.860
Goddamn it, I knew it! He's gone off
again with that no accountin' Manuel.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.897
- My name is George Caldwell.
- Those two get together, smoke a little weed.

28:17.897 --> 28:21.092
Next thing you know, they're off
buzzing the turkeys in the pickup.

28:21.092 --> 28:23.568
- Excuse me, dear.
- I should've fired him 30 years ago.

28:23.568 --> 28:26.037
Excuse me.
Do you think I could use your telephone?

28:26.037 --> 28:27.835
- Telephone?
- Yes.

28:27.835 --> 28:31.071
- You ain't from around here, are you?
- No, I'm lost.

28:31.071 --> 28:33.668
I'm not lost, but I was
thrown off of the Silver Streak.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.475
Thrown off? That a fact?

28:35.475 --> 28:38.108
Tell me, is there a woman in this?

28:39.418 --> 28:41.818
- Well, there's a girl, but...
- I knew it.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.349
No, no, no. It's nothing to do
with what you're thinking.

28:45.349 --> 28:49.554
Actually, she's in a great deal of danger.
That's why I have to use your telephone...

28:49.554 --> 28:51.755
so I can call the police and have those
people who threw me off the train arrested.

28:51.755 --> 28:55.426
- Well, it sounds like you're in an awful hurry.
- I am. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

28:55.426 --> 28:58.595
That suits me just fine...
'cause I'm running a little bit late myself.

28:58.595 --> 29:02.198
- Tell you what, Steve.
- George. George Caldwell.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.242
- Rita Babtree.
- How do you do?

29:04.242 --> 29:08.746
If you'll finish milking old Harriet over there...
I'll go in and change and you can ride into town with me.

29:08.746 --> 29:11.179
- Oh, great!
- The sheriff's a good friend of mine.

29:11.179 --> 29:13.376
Wonderful. Just tell me
what I have to do.

29:13.376 --> 29:16.648
Well, you just take
this bucket and milk her.

29:16.648 --> 29:19.747
Milk her?
I've never milked a cow before.

29:19.747 --> 29:23.726
Cut the gas, Steve.
You're a grown man.

29:23.726 --> 29:25.990
I'm sure you've had
some similar experience.

29:28.499 --> 29:30.490
Look, you just sit down...

29:30.490 --> 29:33.059
take a tit in each hand and
let nature take its course.

29:33.059 --> 29:34.365
All right.

29:34.365 --> 29:36.270
These cows are so full...

29:36.270 --> 29:39.242
it's like tapping a trip valve
on Niagara Falls.

29:39.242 --> 29:42.210
- I'll go in and change and meet you
outside in 10 minutes.
- All right.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.110
I'll do my best.

29:45.148 --> 29:46.672
Hello.

29:51.021 --> 29:52.579
Let's see.

29:53.790 --> 29:56.224
Just be nice.
Be nice.

29:56.224 --> 29:58.591
Wait a minute.

29:59.663 --> 30:02.791
Something's wrong.
You've got four of them.

30:06.169 --> 30:09.195
Oop.! Come on, Harriet.
Come on. Give me a break.

30:10.741 --> 30:13.938
Nice, fresh milk.
Here it comes.

30:14.978 --> 30:18.777
Nothing's coming out though.
Here we go.

30:18.777 --> 30:23.649
All right, now, I know I'm a slow
starter, but where's Niagara Falls?

30:27.590 --> 30:29.615
Hey, Steve, whatcha doin'?

30:29.615 --> 30:32.661
I was just looking at my schedule
for the Silver Streak.

30:32.661 --> 30:35.128
No, I don't mean that. I mean...

30:35.128 --> 30:38.394
why are you sittin' in that car?
We ain't goin' in that.

30:38.394 --> 30:41.061
- We aren't?
- No!

30:41.061 --> 30:44.573
Come on, Steve.
Follow me.

30:50.645 --> 30:53.580
Put these packages
in the front seat...

30:53.580 --> 30:55.809
and I'll get the wheel blocks.

30:55.809 --> 30:58.614
I sure hope Pepe
filled it with enough gas.

30:58.614 --> 31:00.922
We're not going in that, are we?

31:00.922 --> 31:03.421
What's the matter?
You afraid of flyin'?

31:03.421 --> 31:06.016
No, no.
I'm not afraid.

31:06.016 --> 31:09.859
Great, 'cause it ain't no fun
soarin' with a turkey.

31:16.404 --> 31:18.964
Look out for the windmill.
Look out for the windmill!

31:25.712 --> 31:28.681
- You okay with those packages?
- Yeah, I guess so.

31:28.681 --> 31:33.208
Well, it won't be long. We should be
in Stavely by 2:00.

31:34.621 --> 31:39.058
2:00? That's two and a half hours from now.
Where's Stavely?

31:39.058 --> 31:42.253
Sixty miles
the other side of Albuquerque.

31:43.163 --> 31:45.324
- Wait a minute.
- What'd you say?

31:47.067 --> 31:50.400
The Silver Streak
stops there at 2:27.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.065
If we got there by 2:00 the sheriff
could meet the train when it arrives.

31:54.065 --> 31:56.074
Yeah, I suppose so.

31:56.074 --> 31:59.077
- This is fabulous!
- Ain't it the truth?

31:59.077 --> 32:04.138
They talk of the joy of sex,
but it don't last like the fun of flyin'.

32:23.569 --> 32:26.037
Look! There's the Silver Streak.!

32:45.723 --> 32:48.749
- I think we're going to make it.
- Look at those sheep down there.

32:48.749 --> 32:52.887
Don't they make a lovely sight?
I'm just itchin'to buzz 'em.

32:52.887 --> 32:54.488
To do what?

32:54.488 --> 32:57.398
- You never buzzed sheep?
- I don't think so.

32:57.398 --> 32:59.595
Hold on, Steve!
We're going in!

33:12.182 --> 33:14.173
Look at those little critters run.!

33:17.187 --> 33:20.088
Come on.! Let's buzz 'em again.!
Whoo-hoo.!

33:32.736 --> 33:34.931
Here we are.

33:34.931 --> 33:38.133
- Hello, Rita.
- Hi, Burt. Is the sheriff in?

33:38.133 --> 33:40.574
- He's over at Clancey's Dairy.
He'll be back in about...

33:40.574 --> 33:42.908
Look!
There's the Silver Streak.!

33:43.979 --> 33:46.641
- Thank you. Thank you, Rita.
- Don't you wanna go get the sheriff?

33:46.641 --> 33:50.811
- No time! Thank you, dear. Good-bye.!
- So long, Steve.

33:57.259 --> 34:00.524
This time, try to stay on!

34:00.524 --> 34:02.563
Come on! Come on!

34:02.563 --> 34:05.361
Jump up! Jump!

34:07.269 --> 34:08.827
You got it!

34:09.938 --> 34:11.735
All right!

34:17.580 --> 34:19.103
Hey, welcome aboard.

34:19.103 --> 34:21.909
- Don't you just love train travel?
- I love it.

34:21.909 --> 34:23.610
- Loves it.

34:56.150 --> 34:59.608
I asked you to join me for breakfast.
This is lunch.

34:59.608 --> 35:01.881
Sorry. I lost track of time.

35:04.558 --> 35:06.685
Well, what were you doin' back there?

35:06.685 --> 35:08.751
Gettin' a little ass?

35:09.663 --> 35:11.858
No, I was squeezing tits.

35:14.001 --> 35:16.162
You are a sexy devil, aren't you?

35:16.870 --> 35:19.964
Kind of worked up a sweat too,
didn't ya, you horny bastard?

35:24.344 --> 35:26.005
Well, what do you expect?

35:26.005 --> 35:28.410
I mean, she's a hot little number.

35:28.410 --> 35:30.711
And he's very heavy competition.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.774
You know him?

35:32.774 --> 35:36.117
Doesn't everybody know him?
That's Roger Devereau.

35:36.117 --> 35:39.955
He's Chicago's own jet-setter.

35:39.955 --> 35:43.018
I mean, you know, he's a big cheese on
the Art Institute, something like that.

35:43.018 --> 35:45.620
Like I say, very heavy competition.

35:46.465 --> 35:48.228
Are you gonna take him on?

36:42.586 --> 36:44.349
Are you all right?

36:50.394 --> 36:52.055
What's the matter?

36:54.131 --> 36:56.998
- Honey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

36:58.168 --> 36:59.829
Who left who?

36:59.829 --> 37:03.669
Last time I saw you, you were
gonna go visit the professor.

37:03.669 --> 37:06.539
- Hilly, the professor is dead.
I'm sure of it.

37:06.539 --> 37:08.043
Listen to me.

37:08.043 --> 37:10.478
I went to his room
this morning, and he wasn't there.

37:10.478 --> 37:13.640
Two dumb thugs
were looking through his things.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.708
They pushed me out of his room
and threw me off the train.

37:16.708 --> 37:19.380
-Threw you off?
-The point is they were searching for something.

37:19.380 --> 37:23.118
I don't know what, but they've killed
the professor for it and now I'm
positive they're gonna go after you

37:23.118 --> 37:26.320
We've gotta get off the train
and contact the police.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.991
- No, George, you've got it all mixed up.
- I don't have it mixed up.

37:29.991 --> 37:32.227
I'm just worried about you.

37:37.807 --> 37:39.934
Hello, Roger.

37:39.934 --> 37:42.739
This is my friend George Caldwell.
Roger Devereau.

37:44.380 --> 37:48.042
- How do you do?
- George has just been telling me
how he'd been thrown off the train.

37:49.117 --> 37:53.281
Oh, you're the one? I'm so pleased
to see you. Are you all right?

37:53.281 --> 37:55.152
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Oh, that's good news.

37:55.152 --> 37:58.681
As soon as I was told,
I contacted the police in Albuquerque...

37:58.681 --> 38:01.991
and told them to spare no expense
to make sure you were safe.

38:01.991 --> 38:05.261
Reace... he's like a child... got off
the train and tried to find you...

38:05.261 --> 38:06.995
say he was sorry.

38:06.995 --> 38:09.560
- How did you get back on?
- Who's Reace?

38:09.560 --> 38:11.731
He's the one that threw you off.

38:13.342 --> 38:17.574
You must remember him... a large man
with not very attractive dental work.

38:17.574 --> 38:20.513
I do remember,
but what does he got to do with you?

38:20.513 --> 38:22.845
He works for me.
He's my chauffeur.

38:22.845 --> 38:25.442
Not very bright,
but extremely loyal.

38:25.442 --> 38:29.649
And naturally, I assume total
responsibility for all his actions...

38:29.649 --> 38:32.591
and will pay for any damages.

38:32.591 --> 38:35.527
And what about that other fellow?

38:35.527 --> 38:38.895
I met another man this morning.
Does he work for you too?

38:39.700 --> 38:43.295
Oh, yes, of course.
You don't know the entire story, do you?

38:43.295 --> 38:47.808
Early this morning, I was having
breakfast with Professor Schreiner...

38:47.808 --> 38:51.971
and he wanted to show me some
important papers connected with his book.

38:51.971 --> 38:54.446
But, unfortunately, they were missing

38:54.446 --> 38:57.642
So we searched
his compartment twice...

38:57.642 --> 39:01.084
and eventually we discovered them
in his trunk in the baggage room.

39:01.084 --> 39:04.914
t was something of an upset,
but if you know the professor....

39:04.914 --> 39:08.193
you'll know he's slightly
absent-minded.

39:08.193 --> 39:10.229
Mr. Devereau, I'm very confused.

39:10.229 --> 39:13.493
I don't understand how you could've
had breakfast with Professor Schreiner.

39:13.493 --> 39:16.296
George thinks
the professor's been murdered.

39:19.105 --> 39:21.266
- Murdered?
- That's right, last night.

39:21.266 --> 39:23.138
That's extraordinary.
Why should you think that?

39:23.138 --> 39:27.873
Because I saw him fall off the roof
of this train just outside this window.

39:27.873 --> 39:31.143
- He was shot in the head.
- You were in this compartment?

39:31.143 --> 39:33.548
I was lying right here.

39:34.853 --> 39:38.050
Hilly, you'll have to go back to
my compartment, straighten it out.

39:38.050 --> 39:41.490
That man Whiney doesn't know
what he's doing. Devereau.

39:41.490 --> 39:44.688
Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduce
Professor Schreiner.

39:44.688 --> 39:46.993
Professor Schreiner, Mr. Caldwell.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.898
- Hello.
- How do you do?

39:49.898 --> 39:51.697
What did you do to your jacket?

39:51.697 --> 39:56.139
Mr. Caldwell is the man that Reace
inadvertently threw off the train.

39:56.139 --> 39:58.642
Oh, yes.

39:58.642 --> 40:03.443
That stupid person.
I do hope you weren't hurt.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.482
No, no.
I'm all right.

40:05.482 --> 40:09.350
I suppose I'm to blame
for this morning's fracas.

40:09.350 --> 40:13.857
After all, none of this would've happened
if I hadn't misplaced the Rembrandt letters.

40:13.857 --> 40:14.577
The what?

40:16.027 --> 40:20.020
It doesn't matter. I'm so glad that you're
all right and managed to get back on the train.

40:20.020 --> 40:23.225
Oh, Professor? Professor,
I put back as much... I put back...

40:24.368 --> 40:26.928
Hey, how'd you get here?

40:26.928 --> 40:31.498
Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduce
an associate of mine, Mr. Whiney.

40:31.498 --> 40:34.977
If an apology is due, I'm sure
that he'd be prepared to make it.

40:34.977 --> 40:38.072
It's a pity that Reace
is not here to do the same.

40:38.072 --> 40:40.582
Reace, that moron.
It was all his fault.

40:40.582 --> 40:43.380
I was looking for the papers.
I never touched you, did I?

40:43.380 --> 40:45.216
- No, no.
- See?

40:45.216 --> 40:50.055
It's been very hectic for me.
I think I'll have a scotch and lie down.

40:50.055 --> 40:54.654
- Why don't you use my compartment?
- Thank you. I will.

40:54.654 --> 40:57.757
Hilly...
will you help him with that mess?

40:58.502 --> 41:01.528
Mr. Caldwell,
it's been nice meeting you.

41:01.528 --> 41:04.836
I hope the rest of the trip for both
of us is a little less exhilarating.

41:04.836 --> 41:06.705
Let's hope so.

41:08.378 --> 41:12.508
Well, I think I've made a silly fool
of myself this morning.

41:12.508 --> 41:14.242
- No, no, not at all.
- No, no, I did.

41:14.242 --> 41:19.049
I was just sticking my nose into a lot
of stuff that's none of my business..

41:19.049 --> 41:22.249
and coming up with some crazy ideas.
You were right.

41:23.359 --> 41:26.294
I guess I was imagining
a lot of things last night.

41:27.463 --> 41:28.953
Probably the champagne.

41:32.668 --> 41:35.694
- Well
- Let me clean your jacket..

41:35.694 --> 41:38.467
Oh, that's all right.
I have another one.

41:38.467 --> 41:41.942
We get to Chicago tomorrow and
I did come on this trip to do some work.

41:41.942 --> 41:43.706
So I'll say good-bye.

41:43.706 --> 41:47.306
- Couldn't you possibly join us for dinner?
- Oh, yes, do.

41:48.584 --> 41:51.143
Thanks. No.
I think I'll just eat in my room.

41:58.526 --> 42:01.393
This latch...
seems to be stuck.

42:03.298 --> 42:05.823
I'll get the porter
to fix it right away.

42:37.130 --> 42:39.894
What are you up to there, lover boy?

42:39.894 --> 42:41.958
Hello, Bob Sweet.

42:42.636 --> 42:44.627
- Hello, Bobby.
- How are ya?

42:46.006 --> 42:47.234
I'm all right.

42:47.234 --> 42:51.209
Better yet, uh, what are you?
A miniature alcoholic?

42:51.209 --> 42:54.509
Did you know that
the Blanard Tunnel...

42:54.509 --> 42:57.049
was the highest point on this line?

42:57.049 --> 42:58.413
Yeah, I knew that.

42:58.413 --> 43:01.647
Did you know that when we reach it,
I intend to be higher?

43:02.521 --> 43:05.319
- Just don't fall off, huh? Okay?
- Oh, no.

43:05.319 --> 43:08.986
I've left this train once already.
That's enough.

43:08.986 --> 43:11.689
You have? What do you mean?

43:11.689 --> 43:14.062
Last night...

43:14.062 --> 43:16.727
just as I was about to...

43:17.837 --> 43:20.499
kiss my beautiful blonde...

43:20.499 --> 43:23.838
I saw her boss
hanging outside the window.

43:23.838 --> 43:26.173
Wait. You saw her boss,
Professor Schreiner, huh?

43:26.173 --> 43:27.974
That's him.

43:27.974 --> 43:29.947
That's the fellow.

43:29.947 --> 43:32.041
He was shot in the head.

43:33.685 --> 43:36.176
I knew that
I had been drinking...

43:36.176 --> 43:38.916
so I went to see
the professor this morning...

43:38.916 --> 43:41.754
and I found this
little weasel of a guy in his room.

43:41.754 --> 43:44.158
- Edgar Whiney.
- That's him.

43:44.158 --> 43:47.687
- How did you know that?
- Oh, I-I know. I just know.

43:47.687 --> 43:49.757
Go on, go on.

43:49.757 --> 43:52.564
Well, then this huge mountain...

43:52.564 --> 43:55.367
with a gold mine stuck in his gums...

43:55.367 --> 43:59.501
picked me up and
threw me off the train.

43:59.501 --> 44:03.013
- What... But you never saw the professor, huh?
- No, I saw him.

44:03.013 --> 44:05.379
- I saw him this afternoon.
- Where?

44:05.379 --> 44:07.384
In Hilly's compartment.

44:07.384 --> 44:11.285
See, the man I saw last night
was a hallucination.

44:12.222 --> 44:14.713
- What did he look like?
- Who?

44:14.713 --> 44:17.226
The professor, you know,
that you saw this afternoon.

44:17.226 --> 44:19.387
Like his picture.

44:19.387 --> 44:24.127
- Did he say anything to you?
- Why are you asking me all these questions?

44:24.127 --> 44:26.692
- Did he say anything...
- Nothing, nothing.

44:26.692 --> 44:28.897
He was tired
and wanted to have a scotch.

44:29.807 --> 44:33.174
You don't have any ice in your drink.
- That's it! Scotch!

44:34.244 --> 44:37.236
Listen. See, you didn't have
a hallucination.

44:38.248 --> 44:40.216
The professor's been murdered.

44:40.216 --> 44:43.081
The guy you saw this afternoon
was a fake.

44:43.081 --> 44:44.881
Oh, no.

44:44.881 --> 44:49.084
Yeah. Listen, I talked to the real
professor last night. I mean it.

44:49.084 --> 44:51.854
He didn't wanna have anything
to do with Mr. Devereau.

44:51.854 --> 44:54.658
Besides that, he's a health nut.
Doesn't touch alcohol.

44:54.658 --> 44:58.360
Oh, Bobby, just because
you're a vitamin salesman?

44:58.360 --> 45:01.096
My name is Stevens.
I'm a federal agent.

45:04.240 --> 45:07.073
We've been working on this case
for two and a half years.

45:08.044 --> 45:10.137
Well, what are you tailing
the professor for?

45:10.137 --> 45:13.273
I am not tailing the professor,
I'm tailing Devereau.

45:13.273 --> 45:14.611
Come on. Let's go.

45:14.611 --> 45:17.174
Wait a minute. What about Hilly?

45:17.174 --> 45:20.153
Don't worry about it. They're not
gonna kill her till we get to Chicago.

45:20.153 --> 45:22.918
I don't even think they'll try
to kill you till then. Come on.

45:25.527 --> 45:28.121
Devereau's men must've brought the
professor back here...

45:28.121 --> 45:30.027
after 9:00 pm last night.

45:30.027 --> 45:33.829
- How do you figure that?
- Because I left him at 9:00 pm.

45:33.829 --> 45:38.362
And because this is the easiest access
to the roof. Somehow, he must've escaped.

45:38.362 --> 45:41.967
He got out to this ladder, then ran back
down the train before they shot him.

45:45.647 --> 45:48.343
You're not going up there, are you?

45:48.343 --> 45:51.976
Yeah. The Blanard Tunnel is up ahead.

45:51.976 --> 45:54.714
Come on up and
keep a lookout, will ya?

45:54.714 --> 45:56.848
All right, I'll try.

46:37.029 --> 46:39.088
What did you find?

46:39.088 --> 46:41.098
It was hooked on
a protruding bolt.

46:44.102 --> 46:47.333
Then I was right.
I did see him.

46:59.785 --> 47:05.017
I'll bet Devereau has already got the body
picked up and placed in cold storage someplace.

47:06.090 --> 47:08.888
Too bad.
He was a sweet old guy.

47:08.888 --> 47:11.689
Buy why did he have
to kill the professor?

47:11.689 --> 47:15.630
He was going to be embarrassed
by the findings in the professor's book.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.060
Two of the institute's Rembrandts...

47:19.060 --> 47:22.003
both bought and authenticated
by Devereau...

47:22.003 --> 47:24.166
were going to be proved forgeries.

47:25.242 --> 47:28.439
The professor had the proof
in his possession.

47:29.547 --> 47:31.879
I asked him last night,
"What was the proof?"

47:32.817 --> 47:36.718
He told me I was going
to have to wait for his lecture.

47:36.718 --> 47:38.777
And Devereau wasn't going to wait.

47:41.124 --> 47:44.560
I think the idea
was to kidnap the professor...

47:44.560 --> 47:46.618
then kill him...

47:46.618 --> 47:50.063
and then substitute
some phony look-alike...

47:50.063 --> 47:52.863
who would botch the lecture
and discredit the book.

47:54.337 --> 47:57.795
- We've gotta find the proof.
- But they have the proof.

47:57.795 --> 48:00.707
They have it. That's what Whiney
and everyone was looking for this morning...

48:00.707 --> 48:02.244
the Rembrandt letters.

48:02.244 --> 48:05.873
They said that they found them
in the professor's trunk.

48:05.873 --> 48:08.918
They're lying. That's the first place
they would've looked...

48:08.918 --> 48:12.385
before they started turning
his room upside down.

48:13.722 --> 48:16.782
No! No, the professor hid them
someplace, somewhere simple...

48:16.782 --> 48:20.056
as a precaution when he found out
Devereau was on the train.

48:20.056 --> 48:22.689
My God! I know where they are!
Come on! Come on!

48:46.788 --> 48:48.779
The Rembrandt letters.

48:51.058 --> 48:53.720
Holy Toledo!
I think you've found it.

48:55.763 --> 48:58.823
This is the genuine article,
penned by the old boy himself, huh?

48:58.823 --> 49:02.495
"Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn. "

49:03.971 --> 49:06.963
Yeah. My guess is there's a fact there's
some kind of a date in all this...

49:06.963 --> 49:09.771
that proves the charges the professor
makes in his book.

49:09.771 --> 49:13.280
Push the button for the porter, will ya?
I wanna get the conductor to radio ahead
to the next town.

49:13.280 --> 49:18.307
You know, it's difficult to believe
that a man was killed over those.

49:18.307 --> 49:21.218
This is the tip of an iceberg.

49:21.218 --> 49:23.779
You know that plane crash
in Cologne, Germany last year?

49:23.779 --> 49:27.793
That was a Devereau special.
A hundred people got killed in that one.

49:27.793 --> 49:31.695
It was just to cover up his involvement
in the Metropolitan Gallery scandal.

49:31.695 --> 49:34.427
We knew he was responsible.
We couldn't pin it on him.

49:35.235 --> 49:40.468
These letters are gonna blow his
multimillion-dollar operation in art sky-high.

49:40.468 --> 49:44.601
That's why she was so distant.
They must've had her in a corner.

49:45.412 --> 49:47.676
I want you to remember
that your neck is on the line too.

49:47.676 --> 49:49.908
You already told him you saw
the real professor shot.

49:49.908 --> 49:54.010
Yeah, I did.
So what do I do now?

49:54.010 --> 49:56.987
You be responsible for Hilly.
Get her off the train and to safety.

49:56.987 --> 49:59.081
- I'm gonna take care of Mr. Devereau.
- Here comes the tunnel.

49:59.081 --> 50:02.059
We'll make our move when the
train gets to Dodge City tonight.

50:03.162 --> 50:06.154
That's appropriate, huh?
Gun smoke at the O.K. Corral.

50:13.272 --> 50:14.933
What happened?

50:16.842 --> 50:18.707
Bob, what happened?

50:20.012 --> 50:22.071
Put-Put 'em back.

50:22.071 --> 50:25.776
Go on, now. Do it.
Get my gun. Take my gun.

50:25.776 --> 50:29.286
Take my gun. Go on.
Get the girl off the train, okay?

50:30.288 --> 50:31.949
Go on.!

50:33.858 --> 50:36.986
You know, I got a funny feeling
this bullet was meant for you.

50:42.901 --> 50:45.131
Shoot.! That man's dead.!

50:47.071 --> 50:50.438
- Holy moly, you shot him!
- I didn't... No.

50:51.175 --> 50:54.374
- No! Wait a minute!
- He's been shot!

50:55.980 --> 50:57.345
A man's been shot!

50:58.116 --> 51:00.107
I didn't shoot him!

51:03.854 --> 51:05.515
Hey. Hey, you're not...

51:05.515 --> 51:08.683
Hey! He's not dead!

53:56.722 --> 53:58.951
Hold it!
Don't move, or I'll shoot!

54:38.095 --> 54:40.086
Son of a bitch!

55:23.606 --> 55:26.473
Wait! Wait!

55:31.748 --> 55:33.340
Wait!

55:36.686 --> 55:40.213
Wait! Hello!

55:44.126 --> 55:47.584
Hello! Hello, please!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

55:47.584 --> 55:50.757
Wait a...
Come on, please! Stop!

56:03.512 --> 56:05.173
Thanks a lot, Eddie.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.426
That's it, boys.!

56:19.426 --> 56:22.088
Blow those babies'heads off!

56:29.137 --> 56:31.071
Excuse me.

56:31.071 --> 56:32.800
Just a minute.

56:32.905 --> 56:35.006
Geez, would you look at that!

56:38.613 --> 56:41.208
That boy is somethin', ain't he?

56:48.723 --> 56:50.247
Commercial.

56:54.695 --> 56:58.187
- Now, what can I do for you?
- I want to report a murder.

56:58.187 --> 57:01.098
A murder. A man's been shot
on the Silver Streak...

57:01.098 --> 57:04.865
and there's a girl who's in great danger.
We have to stop the train.

57:04.865 --> 57:07.270
Now, wait a second.
You say a man's been shot?

57:08.175 --> 57:10.439
- Yes.
- Jumpin'Jiminy!

57:10.439 --> 57:12.706
We've never had a murder before.

57:12.706 --> 57:15.578
Sit down.
Have a cup of coffee. Help yourself.

57:15.578 --> 57:18.311
Now, uh, let's get the facts.

57:20.420 --> 57:24.914
- What did you say your name was?
- Caldwell. George Caldwell.

57:24.914 --> 57:27.619
I'm from Los Angeles.

57:27.619 --> 57:31.789
L.A. Okay.
Who was shot?

57:31.789 --> 57:33.923
- Actually, there were two.
- Two?

57:33.923 --> 57:36.525
Yes. The first was Bob Sweet.

57:36.525 --> 57:38.661
He was a federal undercover agent.

57:38.661 --> 57:40.228
- A fed? No shit?
- Yes.

57:40.228 --> 57:43.537
And the second was a man
by the name of Reace. I shot him.

57:45.044 --> 57:47.706
- You shot him?
- Yes. He shot Sweet.

57:47.706 --> 57:50.180
- Because Sweet was a fed?
- No, because he thought Sweet was me.

57:50.180 --> 57:53.275
- Reace shot Sweet, and you shot Reace?
- Right.

57:53.275 --> 57:56.719
- With a spear gun.
- W-With a what?

57:56.719 --> 57:59.656
You see, I took Sweet's gun,
but I dropped it...

57:59.656 --> 58:01.749
so I had to use a spear gun.

58:03.261 --> 58:05.525
Uh, don't you...
can't we call someone?

58:05.525 --> 58:07.497
Wait a second.
You say you shot Reace with a spear?

58:07.497 --> 58:10.898
Yes. He was going to shoot me.
- With a spear?

58:10.898 --> 58:13.335
No, with a bullet!
He shot the professor.

58:13.335 --> 58:15.498
- Who shot the professor?
- Reace.

58:15.498 --> 58:17.734
- Reace shot Sweet!
- And the professor.

58:19.344 --> 58:21.073
Makes three.

58:22.380 --> 58:26.840
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
The professor was shot last night.

58:28.953 --> 58:31.945
- Uh, can't wejust do all of this later?
- Was there anyone else?

58:31.945 --> 58:34.355
- Anyone else what?
- Shot!

58:34.355 --> 58:38.521
No. No, but there will be soon
if we don't stop the train.

58:38.521 --> 58:42.861
Please, just pick up the phone
and call your superiors.

58:42.861 --> 58:45.458
Tell them I have
the Rembrandt letters.

58:45.458 --> 58:48.801
- That's why the professor was shot.
- Was he with the feds?

58:48.801 --> 58:51.932
- Who?
- This guy Rembrandt.

58:53.811 --> 58:57.645
- Rembrandt is dead.
- Dead? That makes four.

58:58.549 --> 59:01.814
Listen, feller, you sure you're not
makin'this up as you go along?

59:01.814 --> 59:05.286
I'm an officer of the law and I got better
things to do than listen to that funnin'.

59:07.491 --> 59:09.424
That's my hot line.

59:09.424 --> 59:11.551
Now, you take the time to get your facts straight.
When I come back,

59:11.551 --> 59:15.324
I want your answers clear and to the point.
Got that?

59:15.324 --> 59:17.662
And you can start
with who shot Rembrandt.

59:19.702 --> 59:21.795
Hello. Yeah.

59:22.872 --> 59:24.863
This is Chauncey.

59:26.642 --> 59:28.303
No shit!

59:30.079 --> 59:33.480
Jumpin'Jiminy! He's sittin'
right here in my office.

59:34.884 --> 59:36.010
That's right.

59:36.010 --> 59:40.317
Came in here spoutin'some bull about shootin'
some people on the train, wanted to confess.

59:40.317 --> 59:43.290
I knew he was a loony right off.

59:43.290 --> 59:46.020
Oh, yeah. Don't you worry.

59:46.020 --> 59:49.655
I've handled loonies before.
Gotcha.

01:00:09.217 --> 01:00:12.050
Sheriff, I'm sorry.
I guess I was a little rattled before.

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:16.489
- It must've sounded crazy to you.
- Oh, that's perfectly all right, Mr. Caldwell.

01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:19.287
That is what you said your name was,
didn't you? George Caldwell?

01:00:19.287 --> 01:00:20.987
Yeah.

01:00:20.987 --> 01:00:23.427
I really think that we oughta
get on the phone to Washington.

01:00:23.427 --> 01:00:27.058
If they heard what I have to say,
they would stop the train.

01:00:27.058 --> 01:00:29.762
Oh, yeah. Them boys in Washington,
they're pretty smart.

01:00:29.762 --> 01:00:32.101
You ever watch 'em on TV? Bam, bam.

01:00:32.101 --> 01:00:35.836
Sheriff, listen to me! They know
all about Sweet and Devereau.

01:00:35.836 --> 01:00:39.038
I figured that the Silver Streak
should be in Kansas in an hour.

01:00:39.038 --> 01:00:41.513
We could stop the train
at Scott City or maybe Dodge.

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:46.246
All right, mister! Keep your hands where
they are, and we'll have no trouble!

01:00:47.321 --> 01:00:48.811
- Give me that!
- Don't shoot.

01:00:49.456 --> 01:00:51.253
"Don't shoot"?

01:00:51.253 --> 01:00:55.226
You stupid, ignorant,
son-of-a-bitch, dumb bastard!

01:00:55.226 --> 01:00:59.129
Jesus Christ! I've met some dumb bastards
in my time, but you outdo them all!

01:00:59.129 --> 01:01:01.895
Get over there! What the hell
do you think I'm doing?

01:01:01.895 --> 01:01:04.266
I come here to help a girl
who may be killed at any minute...

01:01:04.266 --> 01:01:06.669
and you're playing cops and robbers!

01:01:06.669 --> 01:01:09.105
There ain't no way
you're gonna get away with this!

01:01:09.105 --> 01:01:12.042
Get a... Pick up the phone!

01:01:12.845 --> 01:01:14.403
Pick it up!

01:01:15.648 --> 01:01:17.673
- We know who you are.
- What are you talking about?

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:20.719
That was the county sheriff.
They're comin' to get you. You ain't got a chance.

01:01:21.588 --> 01:01:25.024
- Get me for what?
- For killin' a vitamin salesman on the Silver Streak.

01:01:25.024 --> 01:01:29.618
He was no vitamin salesman. He was
a federal agent. They should know that.

01:01:29.618 --> 01:01:33.096
If you'll just put down
that gun and come along quietly.

01:01:33.096 --> 01:01:36.726
You're outnumbered.
Ain't no way you're gonna escape.

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:38.429
What is that?

01:01:40.372 --> 01:01:42.203
That's my deputy.

01:01:43.141 --> 01:01:44.836
- Get outside.
- All right.

01:01:44.836 --> 01:01:47.174
- Get outside!
- Don't shoot.

01:01:47.174 --> 01:01:48.611
- Don't shoot.

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:55.247
- Don't shoot.
- Keep your hands down. Keep your hands down.

01:01:55.247 --> 01:01:57.686
- Uncle Oliver, look what I got!

01:01:57.686 --> 01:02:00.054
- Keep your hands down.
- Uncle Oliver, he's got your gun.

01:02:00.054 --> 01:02:03.287
Get your hands up! Get against
the wall. Keep your hands up.

01:02:03.728 --> 01:02:06.629
- The whole county knows about you!
- Get back!

01:02:06.629 --> 01:02:09.461
- Keep those hands up.
- They ain't gonna rest till they hunt you down.!

01:02:09.461 --> 01:02:12.434
Keep your hands up. Keep 'em up.

01:02:14.639 --> 01:02:16.834
Uncle Oliver, he's takin' your car!

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:19.740
You ain't ever gonna get away with this!

01:02:21.545 --> 01:02:24.343
- Uncle Oliver! Uncle Oliver, he's got your car.
- Moose!

01:02:24.343 --> 01:02:27.441
One more word outta you,
I'm gonna smash your mouth!

01:02:35.059 --> 01:02:36.583
J.J.! J.J.!

01:02:38.428 --> 01:02:40.862
I got... I got bad news for ya.

01:02:40.862 --> 01:02:42.921
Caldwell's escaped.

01:02:44.334 --> 01:02:47.167
Yeah, look, let's not go into that now.

01:02:47.167 --> 01:02:49.102
He's headed down 350...

01:02:49.102 --> 01:02:51.732
and we can stop him
before he crosses the state line.

01:02:52.842 --> 01:02:54.002
Right.

01:03:01.451 --> 01:03:03.851
Dumb, stupid bastard.

01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:08.079
Shit!

01:03:10.327 --> 01:03:12.817
- Who are you?
- I'm a thief, man.

01:03:12.817 --> 01:03:14.829
Take it easy. I ain't
gonna freak you out no more.

01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:17.263
How about handin' me them keys.
I'd like to get these cuffs off.

01:03:17.263 --> 01:03:18.925
Sorry.

01:03:20.336 --> 01:03:24.204
That's real nice the way you handled
yourself back there with old Oliver. I was listenin'

01:03:24.204 --> 01:03:26.707
- What they want you for anyway, man?
- Murder.

01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:30.510
Drop me off anywhere along in here, okay?
I don't mess with the big "M."

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:34.515
I'm not stopping anywhere.
Do you know the roads around here?

01:03:34.515 --> 01:03:38.417
Maybe we could make a deal. I'm not
a murderer. I'm trying to prevent one.

01:03:38.417 --> 01:03:41.047
But in about a minute, we're
gonna be surrounded by cops.

01:03:41.047 --> 01:03:43.853
If you can get us out of it,
you'd be doing both of us a favor.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:45.951
What do you think?

01:03:45.951 --> 01:03:48.291
I think you better make a right
up here and then a sharp left.

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.955
I'm comin' over.

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:59.973
Jesus Christ, man! That's how you murdered your
victims? Put 'em in a car and bounced 'em to death?

01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:03.101
- Sorry.
- Sorry, my ass!

01:04:03.101 --> 01:04:05.008
You're dangerous.

01:04:07.482 --> 01:04:11.145
Proves one thing, though.
You don't do this for no livin'..

01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:15.544
- No, I don't.
- All right. Just take it easy.

01:04:15.544 --> 01:04:18.091
I'm gonna take over in a minute..

01:04:18.091 --> 01:04:20.150
Don't make no more
sudden moves, okay?

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:22.525
I'm gonna check with headquarters
and find out the game plan for tonight.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.291
He said he was gonna
get back on that train.

01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:28.027
He has to cross into Kansas
on 120 or...

01:04:28.027 --> 01:04:30.797
on 116 or 350.

01:04:30.797 --> 01:04:35.205
Now, I figure if we put stakeouts on
all of those roads, we'll get that feller.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:40.110
The first should be at the junction
of Taubman's Road, on 116.

01:04:43.316 --> 01:04:46.251
- What are you slowing down for?
- There's a truck up ahead.

01:04:46.251 --> 01:04:48.150
So there's a truck up ahead.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.815
We the man.!
Let's turn on the siren...

01:04:50.815 --> 01:04:54.850
get them hippies off the road!
Put some foot into it.! Move it.!

01:04:57.863 --> 01:04:59.524
Oh, God!

01:05:14.013 --> 01:05:16.641
Would you like to drive for a while?

01:05:16.641 --> 01:05:20.651
Car 36 report your position.
Do you read me?

01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.778
Car 36. Chauncey,...

01:05:22.778 --> 01:05:26.848
we're moving in for the roadblock
at the intersection of Taubman's Road and 116.

01:05:26.848 --> 01:05:29.451
That's fine, fellas.
Car 45 is already there.

01:05:29.451 --> 01:05:32.121
We're going in
for a double block on all points.

01:05:32.121 --> 01:05:34.722
The old double roadblock, huh?

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:37.791
That's all I wanted to know, Oliver.
Fasten yourself in, partner.

01:05:39.471 --> 01:05:44.101
You ain't got nothin' to worry about.
I got the nerve and I got the touch.

01:05:46.377 --> 01:05:50.677
Better pull it tighter. Real tight.
I used to do this all the time back home in Texas.

01:05:50.677 --> 01:05:53.512
- Do what?
- Demolition derby.

01:05:54.586 --> 01:05:56.713
I hear somethin' comin',
but I can't see anything yet.

01:05:56.713 --> 01:05:59.222
That's fine, boys.
We got 'em boxed in now.

01:06:00.391 --> 01:06:02.018
- Aren't you gonna slow down?
- Slow down?

01:06:02.018 --> 01:06:04.857
Open your eyes, man, 'cause
I'm gonna make a criminal out of you yet.

01:06:05.896 --> 01:06:08.387
Goddamn it!
Fellas, watch out!

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:27.815
Hello, car 36!
What the hell happened to you guys?

01:06:27.815 --> 01:06:33.016
Hey, Chauncey! This is Grover T. Muldoon!
You wanna know what happened?

01:06:33.016 --> 01:06:36.491
We just whooped your ass!
We whooped your ass!

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:05.215
"I don't know. I met him last night."
I've never seen him before.

01:07:05.215 --> 01:07:08.155
That's what you told us this morning,
and I'm finding it...

01:07:08.155 --> 01:07:10.624
increasingly hard to believe.

01:07:10.624 --> 01:07:13.355
- Well, it's the truth.
- Is it?

01:07:13.355 --> 01:07:16.795
No matter, when the time comes,
we'll take care of Mr. Caldwell.

01:07:16.795 --> 01:07:19.732
Meanwhile, we're going to take...

01:07:19.732 --> 01:07:22.326
extremely good care of you.

01:07:49.964 --> 01:07:52.956
- What are you doing?
- I'm following the plan. Just changed my mind.

01:07:52.956 --> 01:07:56.400
Are you crazy? I thought
we were gonna take the Chevy in back.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.633
Chevy? That's a jerk-off, man!
This here is pure pussy.

01:07:59.633 --> 01:08:03.074
Pure pussy?
I'll tell that to the judge.

01:08:03.074 --> 01:08:06.340
Don't worry about no judge. This here's
gonna get us to Kansas City on time.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.405
Well, how about jail? Did you know
the office was right in front of us?

01:08:09.405 --> 01:08:12.350
Go check the guard, okay?
This ain't gonna take but a second.

01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:38.233
Hold it right there, nigger.

01:08:40.446 --> 01:08:43.142
Hey! How you doin', old dude?
What's happenin'?

01:08:43.142 --> 01:08:44.979
Step away from the car.

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:48.509
was listenin' to the engine. Sounds real good, man.
- Does it come with whitewalls?

01:08:48.509 --> 01:08:49.953
Just move.

01:08:49.953 --> 01:08:52.957
Okay, I'm gonna move now.
You just take it easy.

01:08:52.957 --> 01:08:55.220
I said move!

01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:01.893
A pussy, huh?
A pussy!

01:09:02.501 --> 01:09:04.469
Can we go now?

01:09:06.203 --> 01:09:08.434
I thought you was an amateur.

01:09:08.434 --> 01:09:10.667
You're a real pro.

01:09:13.245 --> 01:09:15.236
A real pro.

01:09:23.654 --> 01:09:26.419
Man, that was beautiful.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with you.

01:09:26.419 --> 01:09:30.791
- Oh, yeah.
- I mean it. You're a pretty bad old dude.

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:32.988
All I wanna do is get to Kansas City
by the morning.

01:09:32.988 --> 01:09:37.091
Don't worry about that. With this honey,
we're gonna be in Kansas City.

01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:39.504
You just get some sleep,
'cause we're on our way to Kansas City!

01:11:03.085 --> 01:11:04.882
You thinking about her?

01:11:05.721 --> 01:11:07.052
Yeah.

01:11:09.191 --> 01:11:11.921
Crazy thing is I just met her
two nights ago.

01:11:13.028 --> 01:11:15.428
That's the way love is.

01:11:15.428 --> 01:11:17.624
I always lose my memory
when I fall in love.

01:11:20.501 --> 01:11:25.131
Like you said, you know,
we just get on the train, get her off...

01:11:25.131 --> 01:11:28.539
tell the police,
let them handle the rest of that stuff.

01:11:31.713 --> 01:11:33.647
Yeah.
Yeah, but what?

01:11:36.718 --> 01:11:39.516
I only hope she's still alive.

01:11:46.961 --> 01:11:48.861
Arriving passenger Hall...

01:11:48.861 --> 01:11:53.525
please report to the information desk
in the north concourse.

01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:57.798
Great! We've got 10 minutes!
I'll get the tickets. Just wait right here!

01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:03.269
- You go get the tickets, and it's good-bye, George.
- What are you talking about? That!

01:12:07.411 --> 01:12:11.315
That's my driver's license picture.
I hate that picture.

01:12:11.315 --> 01:12:14.183
Yeah? Why don't you just shuffle
right over there and tell them about it.

01:12:17.758 --> 01:12:19.885
- Are they the police?
- No, they're from Travelers Aid.

01:12:19.885 --> 01:12:22.428
- How are we gonna get on the train?
- That's a good question.

01:12:22.428 --> 01:12:26.398
- I've still got the gun. I could start a diversion.
- Yeah, blow your brains out.

01:12:26.398 --> 01:12:28.831
Wait. I got an idea.

01:12:28.831 --> 01:12:30.664
You come with me

01:12:42.581 --> 01:12:45.277
- How much you want for that radio?
- Thirty dollars.

01:12:45.277 --> 01:12:48.115
- We'll take it. Pay the man.
- What? Pay the man.

01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:50.678
- That's a bad hat you got on.  I'll give you five dollars for it.
- It's yours.

01:12:50.678 --> 01:12:53.350
- Thank you. Pay the man.
- What? Pay the man!

01:12:56.062 --> 01:12:57.757
And another five
for the shoe polish.

01:12:57.757 --> 01:13:00.355
- What do we want with shoe polish?
- Don't argue. Pay the man.

01:13:01.866 --> 01:13:05.131
- One, two, three, four. Forty dollars.
- Thank you very much.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:08.366
- Thank you.
- See anything else you want, just make me an offer.

01:13:08.366 --> 01:13:10.738
- No, thank you.
- Uh, how about a brush?

01:13:12.744 --> 01:13:14.075
- Nothing!

01:13:15.213 --> 01:13:16.612
Can't win 'em all.

01:13:16.612 --> 01:13:20.708
That is the stupidest idea
I have ever heard.

01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:22.685
You wanna save that girl's life?

01:13:22.685 --> 01:13:25.917
Then it's this or we're dead.
Now take off your jacket.

01:13:25.917 --> 01:13:27.651
Come on!

01:13:29.094 --> 01:13:31.790
- I can't pass for black!
- Who're you tellin'?

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:34.730
I didn't say I was gonna make you black.,
I said I was gonna get you on the train.

01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:37.130
We got to make them cops
think you're black.

01:13:38.569 --> 01:13:42.130
- It'll never work. Never.
- What, are you afraid it won't come off?

01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:44.436
That's a good joke.
That's humorous.

01:13:44.436 --> 01:13:46.669
Like that, huh?
May I speak?

01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:50.305
This is crazy! It'll never work!
Don't you understand?

01:13:50.305 --> 01:13:53.144
Are you kiddin'? Look at that.

01:13:53.144 --> 01:13:55.412
AI Jolson made a million bucks
lookin' like that.

01:13:55.412 --> 01:13:57.249
Now here, you try.

01:13:59.022 --> 01:14:01.422
Don't worry about your eyes,
'cause you're gonna be wearin' these.

01:14:02.593 --> 01:14:04.356
There you go.

01:14:06.063 --> 01:14:08.361
That looks good.
Get on top of your head.

01:14:10.067 --> 01:14:11.727
Put on my jacket.

01:14:15.605 --> 01:14:17.903
Then we'll slap this beanie
on your head. There you go.

01:14:17.903 --> 01:14:19.771
All right, ace or deuce?

01:14:19.771 --> 01:14:23.107
That's bad, man! You're lookin' good!
Now here, take this radio.

01:14:23.107 --> 01:14:25.909
When you step
out of here, step out like King Shit.

01:14:25.909 --> 01:14:26.880
You bad!

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.281
Put that radio to your ear.
That's gonna help cover your face.

01:14:29.281 --> 01:14:31.320
Just move with the rhythm of the music.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.788
Move your body with the rhythm of the music.
That's all you gotta remember, okay?
Let me see you try it.

01:14:34.788 --> 01:14:38.759
Step to the music.
Step to the music. Yeah.

01:14:38.759 --> 01:14:41.956
Step to the music... Stop.

01:14:41.956 --> 01:14:46.160
How come you whiteys got such a tight ass, man?
How are you gonna walk outta here
with a tan face and that white walk?

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.670
Just get into the music.
Come on, George. Loosen up.

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:52.172
Listen to the beat.
Let your feet move.

01:14:52.172 --> 01:14:54.674
Now, do it! Can't you feel it?
The tempo's right here.

01:14:54.674 --> 01:14:57.234
Right in there. That's all you gotta do.

01:14:57.234 --> 01:14:59.678
Yeah, now try it!
Don't you feel it?

01:14:59.678 --> 01:15:04.082
Yeah. Needs work, George.
Needs a lot of work. You know that?

01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:08.680
Will you practice? Man, you gotta practice,
but let it be loose! Listen to the music.
Follow the beat. Hear?

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.817
- Feel it comin' up? Feel it?
- I got it.

01:15:11.817 --> 01:15:15.329
It's comin'?
Yeah, that's it.

01:15:15.329 --> 01:15:19.163
I'm gonna get the tickets. Okay? I'll be back.
Work on it.

01:15:19.163 --> 01:15:20.791
God, honkies!

01:15:33.214 --> 01:15:36.479
Come on, man, get some jive goin'.
Be cool.

01:15:36.479 --> 01:15:39.280
Shake it, but don't break it. That's it.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.287
Hey, man, how do I look?

01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.191
You look sharp, mister.
I feel sharp!

01:15:43.191 --> 01:15:45.622
You hear? I feel like
the sun around midnight.

01:15:45.622 --> 01:15:49.094
You dig? Outta sight!
Get down! Get down!

01:15:49.094 --> 01:15:53.190
Feelin' good! Feelin' fine!
Feelin' real fine!

01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:56.292
That's it. Just loosen up
those hips, sugar.

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:58.394
All you whiteys got a tight ass.
Yeah, get that ass movin'.

01:15:58.394 --> 01:16:01.133
Outta sight! I'm a macaroni!
Get down! I'm the king!

01:16:01.133 --> 01:16:03.574
Number one, baby.!

01:16:10.984 --> 01:16:14.784
- Um, um, I'm not....
- Hey, you must be in pretty big trouble, fella.

01:16:14.784 --> 01:16:18.085
But for God's sake, learn to keep time.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:37.172
Shit, that's my man!
That's my man!

01:16:39.578 --> 01:16:42.240
- I don't think we'll make it past the cops.
- We'll make it past the cops.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.282
I just hope we don't see no Muslims.

01:16:56.228 --> 01:16:58.059
- Who you lookin' for?
- White guy.

01:16:58.059 --> 01:17:00.121
Well, if I see any,
I'll let you know.

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.000
Your attention, please.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.864
The AMRoad train,
the Silver Streak...

01:17:04.864 --> 01:17:08.895
departing for Chicago is now loading
on track three.

01:17:08.895 --> 01:17:12.033
- This the Chicago train?
- First class. Yes, sir.

01:17:12.033 --> 01:17:15.170
There will be no visitors
permitted beyond the gates.

01:17:24.088 --> 01:17:26.818
Board!

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:41.196
- She's gone.
- Sure that's her compartment?

01:17:41.196 --> 01:17:44.968
Yes, of course.
Hey, wait a minute.

01:17:44.968 --> 01:17:46.771
Where are my clothes?
All my clothes are gone

01:17:46.771 --> 01:17:50.074
- You sure this is your compartment?
- Of course I'm sure.

01:17:50.074 --> 01:17:53.344
The police must have taken everything
when they found Sweet's body.

01:17:53.344 --> 01:17:56.011
We've gotta see if Hilly's
still on the train.

01:17:56.887 --> 01:17:59.822
How are we gonna do that and
you can't leave this compartment?

01:17:59.822 --> 01:18:03.223
Go down to the phony professor's room.
It's four cars back, room "C."

01:18:03.223 --> 01:18:05.659
Ask him what happened
to his secretary.

01:18:06.663 --> 01:18:08.324
Give me the gun.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.491
Now give me your wallet.

01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:15.733
- What the...
- I gotta get a disguise... a porter's uniform.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:19.400
You know, these disguises
are getting expensive.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.705
Crime costs.
Where's it at?

01:18:21.705 --> 01:18:25.440
Four cars back, room "C."
Stay out of trouble.

01:19:29.643 --> 01:19:32.806
- Hilly, are you all right?
- George, watch it.! Don't come in here.

01:20:02.074 --> 01:20:03.939
Are you all right?

01:20:03.939 --> 01:20:08.504
That's what I was gonna ask you.
I'm sorry about your head.

01:20:08.504 --> 01:20:12.483
I never would have gone back to the
compartment if I thought that you were gonna...

01:20:12.483 --> 01:20:14.986
- The Rembrandt letters.
- Devereau's got them.

01:20:14.986 --> 01:20:17.181
He found them in your jacket.

01:20:18.424 --> 01:20:22.485
- I guess I blew it.
- Poor George.

01:20:22.485 --> 01:20:24.996
I tried not to get you involved,...

01:20:24.996 --> 01:20:28.522
but they came to me yesterday and they told me
that they'd killed the professor...

01:20:28.522 --> 01:20:30.831
and that unless I cooperated,
they'd kill me too.

01:20:30.831 --> 01:20:32.802
I thought that...

01:20:32.802 --> 01:20:35.772
I'd go along with them
and that then you'd get away.

01:20:35.772 --> 01:20:40.540
I was really happy when you did,
but I was afraid I'd never see you again.

01:20:47.185 --> 01:20:49.016
George, I was so frightened.

01:20:50.489 --> 01:20:52.787
So was I.

01:20:52.787 --> 01:20:54.951
I was scared you wouldn't be here.

01:20:56.895 --> 01:20:58.192
I missed you, Hilly.

01:20:59.631 --> 01:21:01.622
You did?

01:21:01.622 --> 01:21:03.691
I missed you too.

01:21:11.242 --> 01:21:13.710
You've got shoe polish
behind your ear.

01:21:18.849 --> 01:21:21.784
I'll explain that to you later.

01:21:21.784 --> 01:21:25.788
- Where are we?
- Just passing the Illinois River Canal.

01:21:25.788 --> 01:21:29.155
Well, how are you?
I hope I didn't slug you too hard.

01:21:29.155 --> 01:21:32.218
- Where's Devereau?
- Isn't that perfect?

01:21:32.218 --> 01:21:36.357
You want to see him,
and he wants to see you.

01:21:36.357 --> 01:21:38.765
Ladies first, hmm?

01:21:41.138 --> 01:21:42.627
Come in.

01:21:45.675 --> 01:21:48.405
Uh, please sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:21:48.405 --> 01:21:50.605
Miss Burns, how are you?

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:55.049
Bring us some fresh coffee, toast
and marmalade for our guests, would you?

01:21:55.049 --> 01:21:57.109
- Yes, sir.
- Right away.

01:22:01.224 --> 01:22:05.217
I'vejust been looking over
this correspondence you brought me...

01:22:05.217 --> 01:22:06.217
And...

01:22:07.297 --> 01:22:08.992
uh, it's fascinating.

01:22:08.992 --> 01:22:11.590
The professor was right.
It's a remarkable find.

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:14.102
I'm almost tempted
to destroy it...

01:22:14.102 --> 01:22:18.663
but then on the other hand, I've always
had a soft spot for things of beauty.

01:22:18.663 --> 01:22:21.937
Particularly when they were genuine.

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.671
Whiney, would you put these
in my safe, please?

01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:26.213
I don't think they propose...

01:22:26.213 --> 01:22:28.408
any further threat. Do you?

01:22:35.891 --> 01:22:38.291
I hope you're not too disappointed
if this doesn't work.

01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:40.328
Oh, but on the contrary,
I think it will.

01:22:40.328 --> 01:22:43.922
This has been a very difficult project,
and I have made an error or two.

01:22:43.922 --> 01:22:48.231
One of them was bringing that man
Reace out here. What happened to him?

01:22:48.231 --> 01:22:50.328
I shot him.

01:22:50.328 --> 01:22:53.168
Good for you.
He probably deserved it.

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:55.640
You did have him kill
the professor, didn't you?

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.178
Oh, no. Oh, no.
On the contrary.

01:22:58.178 --> 01:23:01.408
He did that on his own.
An unfortunate mistake.

01:23:01.408 --> 01:23:05.612
I knew we couldn't kill the professor
until we had the Rembrandt letters.

01:23:05.612 --> 01:23:11.318
So I had to set up a scenario whereby
the, uh, professor was kidnapped...

01:23:11.318 --> 01:23:15.590
and an imposter impersonated him
in order to discredit him.

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:18.791
We would have killed him anyway, but
his escape attempt the other night...

01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:20.493
upset the entire scheme.

01:23:20.493 --> 01:23:22.399
Come in.

01:23:23.471 --> 01:23:25.995
Excuse me, sir.
It's all confirmed.

01:23:25.995 --> 01:23:28.734
- The car will be waiting at Rockdale.
- Good.

01:23:28.734 --> 01:23:31.402
Oh, Mr. Caldwell,
you do rememberJohnson?

01:23:31.402 --> 01:23:34.072
He played the part
of the professor...

01:23:34.072 --> 01:23:38.208
and would have done the same thing
at Chicago, had it been necessary.

01:23:38.918 --> 01:23:41.478
How long before
we arrive at Rockdale?

01:23:41.478 --> 01:23:43.988
- About an hour and a half, sir.
- Thank you, Johnson.

01:23:44.958 --> 01:23:47.825
Now all that remains
is to clear up a couple of points.

01:23:49.029 --> 01:23:50.690
Meaning the two of you.

01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:52.857
So I've arranged a new scenario...

01:23:52.857 --> 01:23:55.992
wherein you are responsible
for the murder of the professor.

01:23:55.992 --> 01:23:59.732
- Why would I kill the professor?
- To get the Rembrandt letters.

01:23:59.732 --> 01:24:03.241
He found out and you had to shoot him
because he tried to blackmail you.

01:24:03.241 --> 01:24:06.471
Which brings us
more or less up to date...

01:24:06.471 --> 01:24:10.037
Except that
in about 45 minutes from now...

01:24:10.037 --> 01:24:11.878
the professor's trusty secretary
is going to quarrel...

01:24:11.878 --> 01:24:15.784
with her partner/lover...

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:19.187
and shoot him. And he dies...

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:22.386
but not before shooting her.

01:24:26.832 --> 01:24:30.563
Ah, enough of this talk
of plots and scenarios.

01:24:30.563 --> 01:24:33.230
Uh, join me in a cup
of coffee, would you?

01:24:34.106 --> 01:24:35.697
Coffee, mister?

01:24:40.611 --> 01:24:43.876
- Thanks.
- The professor's book
is still gonna be published.

01:24:43.876 --> 01:24:46.815
Oh, yes, indeed, my dear.
But without the letters...

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:50.911
I'm afraid it will be regarded
as the jottings of a revisionist crank.

01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:52.819
An ex-crank,
as a matter of fact.

01:24:52.819 --> 01:24:56.587
The Silver Streak does have its drawbacks,
but please try the marmalade.

01:24:56.587 --> 01:24:59.357
- They do provide an excellent cuisine.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

01:24:59.357 --> 01:25:01.955
I'll tell the boys in the kitchen.
We aims to please.

01:25:01.955 --> 01:25:03.762
- Coffee, miss?
- No, thanks.

01:25:03.762 --> 01:25:07.293
- He ain't bullshittin' about the cuisine.
- Steward?

01:25:07.293 --> 01:25:10.498
- Is that your lady, man? She's somethin' else.
- Steward!

01:25:10.498 --> 01:25:13.634
- Stand up, mama. Let me get a look at you.
- Steward!

01:25:13.634 --> 01:25:16.975
- Mm, mm, mm! Have mercy!
- Steward, you may go. Thank you very much.

01:25:16.975 --> 01:25:19.777
- Just a little more coffee?
- No, thank you.

01:25:19.777 --> 01:25:21.750
Half a cup?
Oh, sorry, sir.

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:24.946
- Look what I've done.
- You... Get out of...

01:25:24.946 --> 01:25:27.182
- See what I've done...
- You ignorant nigger!

01:25:27.182 --> 01:25:29.191
Who you callin' nigger, huh?

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:31.352
You don't know me well enough
to call me no nigger!

01:25:31.352 --> 01:25:33.726
I'll slap the taste out your mouth!
You don't even know my name!

01:25:33.726 --> 01:25:35.958
I'll whoop your ass! Beat the white
of your ass.

01:25:35.958 --> 01:25:38.193
- Who are you?
- I'm a thief.

01:25:39.503 --> 01:25:42.768
It's all right, Hilly.
He's a friend of mine.

01:25:42.768 --> 01:25:45.830
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:48.308
- So this is Mr. Big.
- That's the man.

01:25:49.245 --> 01:25:51.110
You ain't sayin' shit now, Mr. Big.

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:54.877
I must admit that I'm slightly
at a loss for words.

01:25:54.877 --> 01:25:57.544
But on the other hand,
I should warn you...

01:25:57.544 --> 01:25:59.451
that you are a killer...

01:25:59.451 --> 01:26:02.491
and you are wanted by the police
in every state...

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:06.392
and I recommend that
you, uh, be careful.

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:10.758
You're the killer who's wanted
by the police in every state.

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:15.562
That man you had shot wasn't a vitamin
salesman. He was a federal agent.

01:26:15.562 --> 01:26:18.607
They've been after you
for two years.

01:26:18.607 --> 01:26:22.734
Ever since that plane crash
in Cologne, Germany...

01:26:22.734 --> 01:26:26.076
when you caused a hundred people
to die, just to cover up your link...

01:26:26.076 --> 01:26:28.843
with the scandal
at the Metropolitan Gallery.

01:26:28.843 --> 01:26:32.375
So why don't we get them
the proof that they wanted?

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:36.184
Let's go and get
the Rembrandt letters.

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.255
Get up.

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:48.031
If you insist.

01:27:01.582 --> 01:27:03.345
- Get up, Whiney!
- Just do what he says.

01:27:07.387 --> 01:27:09.378
Get the letters, Hilly.

01:27:09.378 --> 01:27:11.253
Mr. Caldwell...

01:27:11.253 --> 01:27:13.850
I take it that you are
a reasonable man and that,...

01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:17.761
like all men, you place
a reasonable value on your life.

01:27:17.761 --> 01:27:19.321
Are you trying to bribe me?

01:27:19.321 --> 01:27:23.165
No. I'm merely pointing out
that life is short...

01:27:23.165 --> 01:27:26.934
and the smart man
hedges his bets.

01:27:26.934 --> 01:27:29.201
You can't protect bets.

01:27:29.201 --> 01:27:31.402
If there's one thing
I have learned from this trip...

01:27:31.402 --> 01:27:34.537
it's that you play the game
and take what you get.

01:27:34.537 --> 01:27:37.208
- I found them!
- Come here, Hilly.

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:39.110
Get the girl.!

01:27:53.966 --> 01:27:56.560
What do you think this is?
A western?

01:28:00.239 --> 01:28:02.901
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to save our asses!

01:28:02.901 --> 01:28:06.307
- I'm not jumping!
- There's a bridge coming up. Get ready!

01:28:06.307 --> 01:28:09.609
Goddamn it, I'm not jumping!
I left this train twice already!

01:28:09.609 --> 01:28:12.582
- Get ready.!
- I'm not jumping!

01:28:12.582 --> 01:28:15.142
Here it comes! Go!

01:28:18.757 --> 01:28:20.349
Son of a bitch!

01:28:24.596 --> 01:28:26.086
Shit!

01:28:27.399 --> 01:28:29.230
Not again!

01:28:47.484 --> 01:28:49.247
What are we gonna do now?

01:28:49.247 --> 01:28:52.153
All right.!
Hold it right there.!

01:28:55.993 --> 01:28:57.551
Shit.

01:29:26.923 --> 01:29:30.154
I just talked to Chaney. He'll have
the helicopter ready in Rockdale.

01:29:30.154 --> 01:29:32.217
Just about five minutes from the station.

01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:34.753
We'll be there in 46 minutes.

01:29:34.753 --> 01:29:39.734
Is there any way of stopping
this train between here and there?

01:29:39.734 --> 01:29:42.669
Aside from the engine, there's
an emergency brake in each car.

01:29:43.639 --> 01:29:46.540
- Disconnect them.
- Okay. All of them?

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:49.076
Yes, all of them.
And take her with you.

01:29:50.178 --> 01:29:51.543
Come on.

01:30:17.105 --> 01:30:19.266
They're yours.

01:30:19.266 --> 01:30:21.809
- You George Caldwell?
- Will you please...

01:30:21.809 --> 01:30:24.640
Would you just tell me...
Goddamn it!

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:27.681
Would you please tell me what the hell
we're doing here and what you want from me!

01:30:27.681 --> 01:30:30.046
- You are George Caldwell?
- Yes, I'm George Caldwell.

01:30:30.046 --> 01:30:33.280
- I want some information from you, and fast.
- I did not kill Sweet.

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:35.254
We know that. And if you weren't
so dumb,...

01:30:35.254 --> 01:30:38.416
you would've realized that we planted
that news story for your own protection.

01:30:38.416 --> 01:30:42.428
I've had men posted in every town
since Dodge City trying to pick you up...

01:30:42.428 --> 01:30:44.623
while you're gallivanting around
the countryside wasting time.

01:30:44.623 --> 01:30:48.634
- I didn't know they were federal agents!
- Well, let's see what you do know.

01:30:51.305 --> 01:30:52.932
Here.

01:30:52.932 --> 01:30:56.306
- How many men has Devereau got on the train?
- Two.

01:30:56.306 --> 01:30:59.504
- What's his plan after they get to Chicago?
- He's not going to Chicago.

01:30:59.504 --> 01:31:01.672
He's getting off at Rockdale.

01:31:02.649 --> 01:31:04.810
I was afraid of that.
Okay.

01:31:07.052 --> 01:31:09.543
Matthews, over here!

01:31:11.056 --> 01:31:13.684
We're gonna stop the train
before Rockdale.

01:31:13.684 --> 01:31:17.092
Closest is...
the Harris Mill Junction.

01:31:17.092 --> 01:31:21.190
Contact the railroad. Tell them to make
out like it's a routine emergency inspection.

01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:24.100
Have Bronsky bring his men
up in choppers from the south..

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:26.866
Get all the passengers off the train,
and I don't want any slip-ups.

01:31:26.866 --> 01:31:29.840
We'll be there as soon as we can.
Caldwell, you come with us.

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.739
Steward, what do you want to do?

01:31:31.739 --> 01:31:35.007
This has been a nerve-shattering
experience. I'd like to go home.

01:31:35.814 --> 01:31:37.441
Take him anywhere he wants.

01:31:37.441 --> 01:31:39.949
Okay, men, grab your rifles.
Let's move it.!

01:31:39.949 --> 01:31:43.044
Caldwell, your shells.

01:31:43.788 --> 01:31:44.508
Let's go.!

01:31:45.957 --> 01:31:49.654
- What does he think I'm gonna do with this?
- Blow the tires out on the train.

01:31:50.428 --> 01:31:51.690
Thanks for everything.

01:31:54.032 --> 01:31:55.431
My pleasure.

01:31:56.434 --> 01:31:58.732
Goddamn it.!
Caldwell, get out here.!

01:31:58.732 --> 01:32:02.261
If there's ever anything
that you need...

01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:07.340
don't call me.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.207
Don't let 'em get you killed.

01:32:16.119 --> 01:32:19.213
Take it easy, killer.
Stay loose.

01:32:35.172 --> 01:32:37.333
Where'd you like to go, fella?

01:32:37.333 --> 01:32:38.738
Well..

01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:43.405
I left myJag in Kansas City.

01:32:58.027 --> 01:33:00.257
I don't know, Frank,
but that's what they said.

01:33:00.257 --> 01:33:02.524
Everybody off
at the Harris Mill Junction.

01:33:02.524 --> 01:33:06.694
Everybody off?
Okay, I'll tell my crew.

01:33:27.022 --> 01:33:31.254
- Why are they stoppin' the train?
-I don't know, sir. Tryin' to get some security check here.

01:33:31.254 --> 01:33:33.521
That's the damnedest thing
I ever heard!

01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:36.462
- They want us to get off the train?
- Yeah.

01:33:37.933 --> 01:33:40.299
- Hey, there's the police!
- Watch your step. Watch your step.

01:33:40.299 --> 01:33:42.666
- Well, I'll be...
- Come on, get back!

01:33:42.666 --> 01:33:45.672
You guys are just totally uncontrollable.
You know that?

01:33:56.050 --> 01:33:57.608
- The police are here.
- What?

01:33:57.608 --> 01:34:00.279
The porters are askin' everyone
to get off the train.

01:34:02.389 --> 01:34:04.084
Are they?

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:10.023
Keep moving towards the clearing, please.

01:34:12.132 --> 01:34:16.228
This is a routine investigation.
None of you is in danger.

01:34:17.805 --> 01:34:21.502
Please cooperate with us so we can
complete our investigation quickly...

01:34:21.502 --> 01:34:24.703
and get you back aboard
and on your way.

01:34:28.401 --> 01:34:29.702
Please keep moving...

01:34:37.323 --> 01:34:38.847
Excuse me.

01:34:41.561 --> 01:34:43.426
Yeah, excuse me.

01:34:47.634 --> 01:34:51.070
- Everybody off, please, Mr. Devereau.
- Yes. What's happening here, Conductor?

01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:54.163
We're not sure. We got a call from
the police wanting everyone evacuated.

01:34:54.163 --> 01:34:56.902
- Maybe it's a bomb scare.
- A bomb scare?

01:34:56.902 --> 01:34:59.705
- Then we'd better get off.
- I certainly am.

01:35:37.615 --> 01:35:39.515
Stay with her.

01:35:39.515 --> 01:35:43.178
Cover us from the window. We're gonna
start the engine and take this thing to Rockdale.

01:35:43.178 --> 01:35:47.748
Hey, what are you doin'? Everybody's gone.
What are you doin' with those rifles?

01:35:52.063 --> 01:35:54.122
You bastards!

01:35:56.967 --> 01:35:59.731
Everyone's off, Chief,
except our boy.

01:36:01.472 --> 01:36:03.099
Hold it right there, Devereau!

01:36:54.456 --> 01:36:56.253
- Shit!
- Take it easy, killer.

01:36:56.253 --> 01:36:58.486
What are you doing here?

01:36:59.762 --> 01:37:01.923
What's going on?
Who's in charge here?

01:37:01.923 --> 01:37:03.589
Would you get down!

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.391
What did you come back here for?

01:37:09.938 --> 01:37:13.465
- Uh... I forgot your wallet.
- Oh, some thief you are.

01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:17.138
- Is that your old lady Hilly?
- Yeah.

01:37:20.214 --> 01:37:21.704
Okay, follow me.

01:37:33.294 --> 01:37:35.319
- Start the engine.
- We can't do that.

01:37:36.297 --> 01:37:38.857
You, move, start it.

01:38:10.764 --> 01:38:13.665
Mr. Devereau.
Mr. Devereau!

01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:25.273
Guido, come with me!

01:38:50.703 --> 01:38:53.365
Keep your foot on the pedal.

01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:15.486
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

01:39:15.486 --> 01:39:17.619
We're getting off at the next stop.

01:39:20.431 --> 01:39:22.991
- What are you doing?
- This is combat.

01:39:51.995 --> 01:39:53.519
Watch out for the engineer.

01:39:57.534 --> 01:39:59.024
Sit!

01:40:29.799 --> 01:40:32.233
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:40:32.233 --> 01:40:34.292
How about Grover?

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.131
Are you all right?

01:40:40.131 --> 01:40:42.302
- Is it over?
- Shit.!

01:41:10.338 --> 01:41:11.828
Look out!

01:41:15.443 --> 01:41:18.879
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:41:22.649 --> 01:41:24.583
Just give me one more pass.

01:41:47.608 --> 01:41:50.771
Just give me one clear shot.

01:42:25.445 --> 01:42:27.276
- What happened?
- Don't look. Don't look!

01:42:32.918 --> 01:42:35.944
All right, get theJunction
on the radio.

01:42:35.944 --> 01:42:38.319
Tell them they've got
a runaway train.

01:42:39.091 --> 01:42:41.286
Hey, we're comin'
into the station.

01:42:55.340 --> 01:43:00.175
George, why didn't we stop?
What's going on here?

01:43:00.175 --> 01:43:02.645
I'm not sure, but I don't think
that there's anyone in the engine.

01:43:02.645 --> 01:43:05.012
- No driver?
- That's right.

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:07.141
Oh, God!

01:43:07.141 --> 01:43:09.709
Whiney cut
all the emergency cords.

01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:11.721
What are we gonna do?

01:43:13.891 --> 01:43:17.019
- Well, we have to find some way to get to the engine.
- How?

01:43:19.063 --> 01:43:20.553
The roof?

01:43:21.999 --> 01:43:24.832
I think so.
Come on!

01:43:35.279 --> 01:43:37.509
- How's it going?
- They don't believe us.

01:43:37.509 --> 01:43:41.744
Look, the engineer is probably anxious
to bring the train in on schedule.

01:43:44.053 --> 01:43:46.214
This is Chief Donaldson.
Who's this?

01:43:46.214 --> 01:43:49.087
This is Jerry Jarvis.
I'm the assistant controller.

01:43:49.087 --> 01:43:51.150
Assistant? Get me your boss.

01:43:51.150 --> 01:43:55.357
Uh, he's out to lunch, but I'm sure
I can handle any problem you might have.

01:43:55.357 --> 01:43:59.026
It's not my problem. You've got a dead
engineer and a runaway train...

01:43:59.026 --> 01:44:02.196
- that's gonna hit Chicago in 15 minutes.
- What are you gonna do about it?

01:44:02.196 --> 01:44:05.400
All right, I'll check
with the signal towers.

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.909
But, uh, you see,
it's impossible.

01:44:07.909 --> 01:44:10.878
If the engineer is dead,
who's driving the train?

01:44:20.656 --> 01:44:23.181
- What's happening?
- Hey, you all right?

01:44:23.181 --> 01:44:26.318
- Listen, is there any way...
- Holy moley! The killer!

01:44:26.318 --> 01:44:28.192
- No, he's okay.
- Listen to me.

01:44:28.192 --> 01:44:31.130
Is there any way to get to the engine
without going over the roof?

01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:33.464
There ain't no way to get to the engine,
period!

01:44:33.464 --> 01:44:36.993
- Why are we goin' so fast?
- Because there's no one driving this train.

01:44:36.993 --> 01:44:40.530
- Impossible. It would stop.
- Does this look as if we're stopping?

01:44:41.343 --> 01:44:44.540
No, the hell it don't.!
I better go pull the emergency cord.

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:46.979
The emergency cords
have been cut.

01:44:46.979 --> 01:44:48.778
Damn hippies!

01:44:51.219 --> 01:44:55.588
I received a report from the signal towers.
They see no engineer in the cabin.

01:44:55.588 --> 01:44:57.521
Great. Now you've got the facts.

01:44:57.521 --> 01:45:00.584
Throw one of those switches
and have the train run off.

01:45:00.584 --> 01:45:04.927
That's the problem.
All the tracks are computer programmed.

01:45:04.927 --> 01:45:07.729
Switching the Silver Streak would only
cause a collision with another train.

01:45:07.729 --> 01:45:11.465
Then what the hell are you gonna do?
There are people riding on that train.

01:45:11.465 --> 01:45:13.370
Oh, no.

01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:14.999
You see, the standard procedure...

01:45:14.999 --> 01:45:18.102
in such an emergency
would be to derail the train.

01:45:18.102 --> 01:45:19.942
Derail it?
In the middle of the yard?

01:45:20.948 --> 01:45:25.281
Yes. Actually,
I can't take that responsibility.
Uh, I'd better get my boss.

01:45:25.281 --> 01:45:28.321
You better do something,
you idiot, because in 10 minutes...

01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:30.379
you're gonna have
200 tons of locomotive

01:45:30.379 --> 01:45:33.984
smashing through Central Station
on its way to Marshall Fields!

01:45:38.064 --> 01:45:41.500
- Where are we going?
- If you wanna stop this train, you got to follow me!

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:48.304
Hey, Jack,
have you seen Benny?

01:45:48.304 --> 01:45:50.935
Uh, yeah, yeah. I saw him
in the coffee shop, Jerry.

01:46:00.085 --> 01:46:02.883
Now what we have to do
is uncouple the cars.

01:46:02.883 --> 01:46:05.947
You gotta pull up that bar,
turn it to the left.

01:46:05.947 --> 01:46:09.620
When they pull apart, they will
bust open the air pressure lines...

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:12.892
and the brakes will clamp on throughout
the train, then you can jump on back.

01:46:13.565 --> 01:46:15.863
- But that's dangerous.!
- Impossible, man.

01:46:16.769 --> 01:46:18.361
Grab hold of my belt.

01:46:18.361 --> 01:46:20.305
- What are you gonna do?
- Guess!

01:46:26.878 --> 01:46:30.541
- Have you seen Benny?
- Well, if it isn't the little Caesar of the railroad.

01:46:30.541 --> 01:46:33.583
- Have you seen Benny!
- No. No!

01:46:33.583 --> 01:46:35.015
Try next door.

01:47:17.159 --> 01:47:18.251
What's the matter?

01:47:18.251 --> 01:47:20.989
The Silver Streak is a runaway.
What do we do?

01:47:22.331 --> 01:47:24.458
Jesus! It's gonna be here
in four minutes!

01:47:40.816 --> 01:47:42.749
Your attention, please.

01:47:42.749 --> 01:47:45.752
May I have
your attention, please.

01:47:45.752 --> 01:47:49.779
You are requested to walk to
the nearest exit as quickly as possible.

01:47:49.779 --> 01:47:51.348
Please do not run.

01:47:51.348 --> 01:47:54.554
Walk as quickly
as possible to the nearest exit.

01:47:55.363 --> 01:48:00.426
People waiting for the arrival
of the Silver Streak on track five...

01:48:00.426 --> 01:48:02.663
are requested to vacate
that area immediately.

01:48:24.858 --> 01:48:30.262
This is an emergency. Please continue
to the nearest exit where a station security...

01:48:51.518 --> 01:48:56.045
Exit as quickly as possible.
You must leave the building..

01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:22.002
We did it! We made it!
We made it, man! Whoo!

01:50:24.408 --> 01:50:25.898
Holy shit!

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:32.249
Hello, Chicago! Hello!

01:50:32.249 --> 01:50:34.181
Gotta drink to that!

01:50:50.166 --> 01:50:53.533
I don't know about you,
but next time I'm gonna take the bus.

01:50:53.533 --> 01:50:56.800
Maybe I'm crazy,
but it looks as if it's grinning.

01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.774
Yeah, like the cat
who swallowed the canary.

01:50:59.774 --> 01:51:02.174
- Where's Grover?
- I don't know.

01:51:10.386 --> 01:51:13.582
Take it easy, killer.
Stay loose!

01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:17.287
What's he doing?

01:51:17.287 --> 01:51:19.020
He's crazy.

01:51:20.062 --> 01:51:22.553
Crazy? He's got the right idea.

01:51:22.553 --> 01:51:25.532
- Let's get outta here and go to a park.
- A park?

01:51:25.532 --> 01:51:28.035
Yeah. I want
to lie back on the grass...

01:51:28.035 --> 01:51:30.765
and have you teach me
some more about gardening.
