33:17.517 --> 33:18.909
-THE AIRWAY MUST BE BLOCKED.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.651
-I PUSHED MY WAVE BELT OUT.
MAYBE SOMEONE WILL SEE IT.

33:21.782 --> 33:24.437
-MY TANKS WERE OUT OF AIR,
SO I DROPPED THEM.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.917
I'M STARTING TO FEEL FAINT.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.877
-WE'LL RELEASE THE AIR
FROM MY TANK.

33:39.669 --> 33:40.888
-THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE?

33:42.368 --> 33:44.370
-MAYBE THIS IS THE TIME
YOU SHOULD TEACH ME
HOW TO MEDITATE,

33:44.500 --> 33:46.372
SO I CAN LEARN
TO SLOW MY BREATHING.

33:46.502 --> 33:49.723
-WHY BOTHER?
WE'RE GOING TO BE
OUT OF AIR SOON.

33:54.206 --> 33:58.079
-LOOK... YOU REALLY WEREN'T
THAT BAD OF A ROOMMATE.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.257
I'M SORRY IF I MADE IT
DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.856
-ACCORDING TO THEIR DIVE LOG,
THEY'VE BEEN UNDER WATER
FOR 45 MINUTES.

34:35.985 --> 34:37.597
THEY'RE BOUND TO BE
RUNNING OUT OF AIR.

34:37.726 --> 34:39.728
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL CALL
LIEUTENANT SWEET AT THE GROUP.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.862
WE'LL HAVE DIVERS
AND A NAVY E.O.D. TEAM
DOWN HERE IMMEDIATELY.

34:42.993 --> 34:45.474
-SIR, THAT'LL TAKE AT LEAST
A HALF AN HOUR.

34:45.605 --> 34:48.650
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S AGAINST REGS,
BUT LAWRENCE AND I HAVE OUR OWN
PERSONAL DIVE GEAR ON-BOARD.

34:51.915 --> 34:53.178
-ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.427
-COME ON, C.J.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.603
DON'T QUIT ON ME.
COME ON.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.692
-[TAPPING]

35:31.041 --> 35:32.478
-WHAT'S THAT?

35:32.608 --> 35:33.740
-WHAT?

35:33.870 --> 35:36.003
-I HEARD SOMETHING.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.787
I'M GONNA SWIM TO THE ENTRANCE.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.486
-DON'T LEAVE ME.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.009
-I HEARD A SOUND.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.273
-YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
ENOUGH AIR TO GET BACK.

35:45.404 --> 35:46.448
-YES, I WILL.

35:47.319 --> 35:48.494
OKAY.

35:50.844 --> 35:51.975
I'LL BE BACK.

35:52.585 --> 35:53.716
I PROMISE, C.J.

36:26.836 --> 36:29.361
-YEAH, YEAH. STANDING BY.
-120 FEET, SIR.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.058
-COMIN' AT YA.
-ALL RIGHT. EASY, EASY.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.176
-FLOAT'S UP!

37:39.474 --> 37:40.736
-COME ON, C.J.!

37:43.565 --> 37:46.089
COME ON, C.J.!
BREATHE. COME ON!

37:49.441 --> 37:51.094
LISTEN TO ME! BREATHE!

37:53.619 --> 37:57.013
-[COUGHS]
-OH! OH, THANK GOD!

37:57.144 --> 37:59.277
-JUST RELAX.
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT NOW.

38:00.147 --> 38:01.322
-I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

38:27.479 --> 38:30.612
MARK!
-HEY, WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT SEA SLUG?

38:30.743 --> 38:33.572
-HE WAS ON THE RUN.
HAD A BAG OF EXPLOSIVES.

38:33.702 --> 38:36.531
LANDED ON THE BOTTOM
FOR THE E.O.D. TEAM.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.533
DO YOU WANT A RIDE
BACK TO THE SHIP?

38:38.664 --> 38:40.840
-NOT ON THE SAME BOAT WITH HIM.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.798
-WE'RE OKAY!
-ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU ON BOARD.

38:42.929 --> 38:45.671
-SO, UH, ANYBODY WANT
TO GO DIVE FOR BURIED TREASURE?

38:45.801 --> 38:47.890
-I THOUGHT YOU FOUND
THE BURIED TREASURE.

38:48.021 --> 38:50.110
-HE MEANS THE STOLEN SAFE
WITH THE JEWELS.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.199
-OH, THAT TREASURE.
-YEAH.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.548
-SO, DO WE GET TO KEEP
WHAT WE FIND?

38:53.679 --> 38:55.289
-I'M AFRAID THE FBI
MIGHT OBJECT.

38:56.421 --> 38:59.772
-WELL, THEN WE'LL SETTLE FOR
THE TREASURE HUNTERS INSTEAD.

39:10.522 --> 39:13.089
-MY DAD'S WORKING
AT THAT TOWER RIGHT THERE.

39:13.220 --> 39:15.396
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE.
-OH, WISH ME GOOD LUCK.

39:15.527 --> 39:17.311
-HERE, WAIT. I, UH...

39:17.442 --> 39:18.791
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

39:19.748 --> 39:21.620
IT'S MY LUCKY MARBLE.
IT'S ALWAYS WORKED FOR ME.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.056
-THANK YOU, HOBIE.

39:35.634 --> 39:38.680
-ELKE. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

39:38.811 --> 39:42.075
-WELL, THE WEEKEND IS UP,
AND I CAME TO DISCOVER MY FATE.

39:43.337 --> 39:46.514
THIS IS WONDERFUL. I'D LOVE
TO WORK OUTDOORS LIKE THIS.

39:46.645 --> 39:49.561
-REALLY? THEN WHY TAKE A JOB
INSIDE A HOUSE?

39:50.300 --> 39:51.911
-BECAUSE THAT'S
WHERE MY JOB IS DONE.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.043
-YEAH, BUT THERE'S SO MANY
OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO.

39:54.174 --> 39:55.784
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHY BE A HOUSEKEEPER ANYMORE?

39:55.915 --> 39:58.004
-THIS IS WHAT I WANT
TO DO NOW, YOU KNOW?

39:58.134 --> 40:00.267
TO LIVE WITH AN AMERICAN FAMILY
AND CARE FOR THEM.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.401
-WHY?
-BECAUSE IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

40:09.885 --> 40:13.628
-ANYWAY, UH...
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GET TO THE POINT?

40:14.977 --> 40:16.892
I CAN'T HIRE YOU
AS A HOUSEKEEPER.

40:17.023 --> 40:18.981
I'VE DECIDED
NOT TO HIRE ANYONE.

40:19.112 --> 40:21.593
-IT'S MY FAULT, ISN'T IT?
-NO, IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

40:21.723 --> 40:22.637
IT'S JUST THAT...

40:23.421 --> 40:24.900
I REALIZED
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

40:25.031 --> 40:26.946
FOR ME AND HOBIE
TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.

40:27.555 --> 40:29.644
REALLY, ELKE,
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

40:31.733 --> 40:32.865
I'M SORRY.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.520
-WELL, WHAT IF YOU FELL IN LOVE
AND GOT MARRIED?

40:35.650 --> 40:37.435
THEN YOU'D HAVE SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

40:37.565 --> 40:40.829
-TRUE, BUT HOBIE WOULDN'T HAVE
FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER, TOO.

40:42.048 --> 40:43.353
AND HE WOULDN'T GET JEALOUS

40:43.484 --> 40:45.573
IF I WANTED TO SPEND
TIME WITH HER.

40:48.010 --> 40:49.795
-I'LL PACK MY THINGS
AND LEAVE TONIGHT.

40:53.363 --> 40:54.495
-ELKE, WAIT A MINUTE.

41:08.204 --> 41:09.597
-I'M GONNA MISS ELKE.

41:09.728 --> 41:10.772
-I WON'T.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.079
-HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

41:13.645 --> 41:15.429
SHE WAS SO MUCH FUN
TO BE AROUND.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.344
-THAT'S WHY I WON'T MISS HER.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.737
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:20.042 --> 41:21.696
-WELL, SHE WON'T BE
OUR HOUSEKEEPER ANYMORE,

41:21.827 --> 41:22.828
SO I WON'T MISS HER.

41:24.046 --> 41:26.222
-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41:26.353 --> 41:30.183
-HOBIE, I WON'T MISS HER
BECAUSE SHE'S HAVING DINNER
WITH US TONIGHT.

41:30.313 --> 41:34.100
SHE WON'T BE COOKING,
SHE WON'T BE CLEANING,
SHE WON'T BE SLEEPING OVER.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.405
-THEN WHAT'S SHE DOING?

41:36.232 --> 41:38.278
-SHE'S GOING OUT
ON A DATE WITH ME.

41:38.408 --> 41:40.976
I MEAN, THAT IS
IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

41:41.107 --> 41:42.848
-ME, HANDLE IT?

41:43.544 --> 41:45.633
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GONNA
BE LEFT OUT OF ALL THE FUN.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.941
-NO, I WON'T.
-YES, YOU WILL.

41:49.071 --> 41:50.246
-NO, I WON'T.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.683
-YES, YOU WILL.
-NO, I WON'T!

41:51.813 --> 41:54.773
-[BOTH LAUGHING]

41:54.903 --> 41:56.339
-HEY! HEY!

42:00.692 --> 42:02.345
-HEY, DON'T PUT THAT
ON MY HEAD!

42:02.476 --> 42:03.695
-HEY! WATCH IT! DON'T--
