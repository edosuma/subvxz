WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.712
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.796 --> 00:06.299
Saul Berenson, my new
national security advisor.

00:06.383 --> 00:08.218
We have
a very troubling situation

00:08.301 --> 00:12.013
that's grown more and more
out of control-- O'Keefe.

00:12.097 --> 00:14.182
The only reason the Feds haven't
caught up with me is because

00:14.265 --> 00:16.267
of the courage and kindness
of families like yours.

00:16.351 --> 00:18.812
I'm proud to be fightin'
on your side.

00:18.895 --> 00:21.064
I'm gonna ask one of the guys
to drive me to town today.

00:21.147 --> 00:22.774
There's a bus station there.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.275
Wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

00:24.359 --> 00:26.945
I told you. I'm done.
I need to go home.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.363
FBI won't leave
without O'Keefe.

00:28.446 --> 00:31.324
Tell me where you took him.
I will end this.

00:31.408 --> 00:34.077
You think, what? He'll just
turn himself in without a fight?

00:34.160 --> 00:36.246
We go together.

00:36.329 --> 00:37.872
Then it's O'Keefe and me.
Agreed?

00:40.750 --> 00:42.836
She's got some
connection to Wellington.

00:42.919 --> 00:44.838
<i>A colleague, maybe?
A secret girlfriend?</i>

00:44.921 --> 00:46.256
What about
our last encounter

00:46.339 --> 00:48.216
suggested I ever wanted
to hear from you again?

00:48.299 --> 00:49.843
I just need you to ID her.
It's important.

00:51.428 --> 00:54.347
You know, not every shred
of non-conventional behavior

00:54.431 --> 00:56.474
boils down to
an onset of hypomania.

00:56.558 --> 00:58.226
There's a vast government
conspiracy, and you're

00:58.309 --> 01:00.228
the only person who could bring
it to light. I know, Carrie.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.438
You're acting like
it's me off my meds.

01:01.521 --> 01:02.981
I'm on my meds.

01:03.064 --> 01:06.192
Are you aware that lithium
can become ineffective?

01:06.276 --> 01:07.694
It simply stops working.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.738
Fuck!

01:09.821 --> 01:13.032
Unlock my computer,
or I will fucking kill you!

01:13.116 --> 01:14.909
Let me go.

01:14.993 --> 01:16.494
Aah!

01:16.578 --> 01:18.913
Aah!

01:32.135 --> 01:34.512
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:34.596 --> 01:35.930
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:36.014 --> 01:40.310
<i>What was his name?</i>

01:40.393 --> 01:44.022
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

01:44.105 --> 01:46.566
<i>You don't have
my condition.</i>

01:46.649 --> 01:49.027
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

01:49.110 --> 01:50.528
<i>since I was 22.</i>

01:52.572 --> 01:55.784
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

01:55.867 --> 01:58.745
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

01:58.828 --> 02:02.457
<i>Civil... War.</i>

02:02.540 --> 02:04.584
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:04.667 --> 02:07.545
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:07.629 --> 02:10.006
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:10.089 --> 02:11.758
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:11.841 --> 02:16.137
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:18.932 --> 02:22.435
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:22.519 --> 02:26.231
<i>We're talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:26.314 --> 02:29.192
<i>Our country
is under attack.</i>

02:31.152 --> 02:34.322
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:35.782 --> 02:39.035
<i>I swore an oath
to protect it.</i>

02:41.454 --> 02:43.414
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

02:43.498 --> 02:49.128
<i>a beacon steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

03:11.568 --> 03:15.530
- Dr. Meyer?
- Carrie! Jesus. You scared me.

03:15.613 --> 03:18.283
Do--do you have, like,
five minutes?

03:19.492 --> 03:21.202
I have a patient coming in.

03:21.286 --> 03:23.788
I really need to talk
to you. Now.

03:25.290 --> 03:28.251
Please?

03:28.334 --> 03:30.336
Five minutes.

03:36.885 --> 03:39.095
Oh, my God.
You're bleeding.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.889
- Um, I'm fine.
- What happened?

03:40.972 --> 03:42.974
- Nothing. Uh...
- There's blood on your head.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.018
- We should get you to an E.R.
- I don't have a head wound.

03:45.101 --> 03:48.229
A head wound would be
a fucking relief. Can you focus?

03:49.606 --> 03:51.357
O-Okay.
Why don't you sit down?

03:51.441 --> 03:54.944
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine. Just... have a seat.

03:58.698 --> 04:01.409
- Are you gonna sit?
- I'm not, actually.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.328
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.330
I think you're right.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.874
I think my, uh, my lithium
is crapping out.

04:07.957 --> 04:09.792
What have you noticed?

04:09.876 --> 04:12.629
I'm jittery. My heart rate
is up. I'm talking too fast.

04:12.712 --> 04:14.672
I've been through this
a zillion times.

04:14.756 --> 04:16.591
I-I know what
it looks like, so...

04:16.674 --> 04:20.345
C-could we just, um...could we
try another medication?

04:20.428 --> 04:22.722
I'm happy
to change your meds

04:22.805 --> 04:24.807
once we have a better sense
of what the situation is.

04:24.891 --> 04:26.768
Well, I just told you.

04:26.851 --> 04:29.479
You show up unannounced, looking
like a truck ran you over

04:29.562 --> 04:33.358
and tell me that the problem
is your rate of speech?

04:33.441 --> 04:35.360
I'm concerned
you may be injured.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.862
I am concerned you may
need an HIV screen.

04:37.946 --> 04:41.699
- No, it's not like that.
- I'm...

04:41.783 --> 04:44.327
I had a few glasses of wine
and-and fell down.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.955
It's embarrassing.

04:47.038 --> 04:50.208
Have you been drinking
too much in general?

04:50.291 --> 04:52.335
Maybe.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.671
- Blacking out?
- No.

04:54.754 --> 04:56.589
What else? Hearing voices?

04:56.673 --> 04:59.842
No. No voices.
No visions.

04:59.926 --> 05:02.428
But...

05:02.512 --> 05:04.764
I'm grandiose.
I think...

05:04.847 --> 05:07.350
we can all agree on that.
And, um...

05:07.433 --> 05:09.519
impulse control...

05:09.602 --> 05:13.481
is becoming a problem.
So...

05:13.564 --> 05:15.274
When I'm like this,

05:15.358 --> 05:16.693
it doesn't get better,
it gets worse.

05:16.776 --> 05:18.569
If--if--
if the lithium is...

05:18.653 --> 05:22.073
isn't working...

05:26.494 --> 05:29.122
It saved
my life, that drug.

05:29.205 --> 05:33.084
I have a child. This cannot
be happening to me.

05:33.167 --> 05:36.713
You know the drill pretty well.
Wanna get to the rest of it?

05:38.589 --> 05:39.590
What?

05:39.674 --> 05:42.385
Are you a danger
to yourself?

05:42.468 --> 05:45.847
Suicide? No.
No, no. I-I...

05:47.598 --> 05:51.853
I couldn't
do that to Franny.

05:51.936 --> 05:55.106
But it's safe to say I'm not as
risk-averse as-as I should be.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.650
Okay, does that mean
you're a danger to others?

06:22.383 --> 06:25.678
Okay, stop.
This is far enough. Stop.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.361
I'll take it from here.

06:42.445 --> 06:45.531
For the record,
this is fucking nuts.

07:02.131 --> 07:05.635
Hey.

07:05.718 --> 07:07.845
Hello.

07:07.929 --> 07:12.100
My name is Saul Berenson.
I'm looking for Brett O'Keefe.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.684
Who?

07:13.768 --> 07:15.561
Brett O'Keefe?
I was told he's here.

07:15.645 --> 07:18.022
Somebody told you wrong.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.406
Hey!

07:27.490 --> 07:28.908
Good boy.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.368
So you're FBI?

07:30.451 --> 07:32.745
I work for the president
of the United States.

07:32.829 --> 07:35.915
Need to talk to Mr. O'Keefe.
It's important.

07:35.998 --> 07:39.085
I told you, nobody here
by that name.

07:40.545 --> 07:42.880
Tell him I'm not leaving
till I see him.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.135
I'll go get my dad.

07:47.218 --> 07:48.261
Hey.

08:05.778 --> 08:08.364
Carrie?

08:08.447 --> 08:10.366
- Carrie?
- Hi.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.243
Fucking hell.
She's right here.

08:12.326 --> 08:15.371
I don't have any idea.
Would you call the precinct,

08:15.454 --> 08:18.249
let them know
we found her? Yeah.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.001
Sorry.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.711
We called every hospital,
every--

08:21.794 --> 08:24.797
- I just said I'm sorry.
- Franny was terrified.

08:24.881 --> 08:26.382
Why didn't you just
tell her I was working?

08:26.465 --> 08:27.967
Because you don't have a job.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.344
She's not a baby.
She understands things.

08:30.428 --> 08:32.513
Not to mention the fact that
we don't lie to our children.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.223
Back off. Okay?

08:36.767 --> 08:40.354
I was at the shrink,
exactly like you wanted.

08:40.438 --> 08:42.523
You were right.
I'm-I'm...

08:42.607 --> 08:44.692
I'm not myself.

08:44.775 --> 08:45.943
At all.

08:48.779 --> 08:53.576
Apparently, I've
developed a lithium tolerance.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.036
Dr. Meyer told you this?

08:55.119 --> 08:57.371
Basically, she wants me to...

08:57.455 --> 09:00.458
...sedate myself into a coma
to break the manic cycle.

09:03.461 --> 09:05.463
Seroquel.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.964
That'll knock you out
for a few days.

09:07.048 --> 09:09.091
At least.

09:09.175 --> 09:10.676
And then what?

09:10.760 --> 09:12.637
Uh, we start experimenting
with different drugs,

09:12.720 --> 09:15.181
maybe augment the lithium
with a second drug.

09:15.264 --> 09:16.515
maybe...

09:16.599 --> 09:18.684
replace it altogether.

09:18.768 --> 09:20.853
Oh, my God.

09:20.937 --> 09:23.189
Oh, God. I can't believe
this is happening.

09:23.272 --> 09:26.192
Hey, come here.

09:30.947 --> 09:34.575
Maggie, I'm so scared.

09:34.659 --> 09:37.453
Don't be.
We'll get through this.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.080
And we've
been here before.

09:39.163 --> 09:42.208
But we haven't.
We haven't been here before.

09:42.291 --> 09:43.751
I'm starting at
the beginning again.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.711
It--it could take...

09:45.795 --> 09:47.255
months to find
the right dosage,

09:47.338 --> 09:50.383
or years, or--or--
or maybe nothing works.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.844
I can't raise a kid

09:53.928 --> 09:56.931
if I'm at the bottom of
a black hole with no walls.

09:57.014 --> 10:00.101
- Fuck.
- That is not going to happen.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.560
You don't know that.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.771
I know that we will do
everything possible

10:03.854 --> 10:05.564
- to find an effective treatment.
- Listen to me.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.234
I can't have Franny visiting me
in a locked ward, ever.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.860
I don't care what
you say to her.

10:09.944 --> 10:11.862
She can't see me like that.

10:11.946 --> 10:13.614
- She won't.
- Promise me.

10:13.698 --> 10:15.616
I would rather you say
I was dead.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.535
- Stop.
- I mean it.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.870
I do, too. Stop it.

10:21.956 --> 10:23.874
Now...

10:23.958 --> 10:26.210
let's get you started
on the Seroquel.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.507
Okay.

10:39.307 --> 10:43.102
Shit.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.941
Tell 'em to stand down.

10:49.984 --> 10:51.360
All right, just stay here.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.324
So who turned me in?

10:56.407 --> 11:00.202
Let me guess--tall one
with the blond hair.

11:00.286 --> 11:02.747
He seemed
like the weak link.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.499
Does it matter?

11:05.583 --> 11:06.917
It's over.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.628
I don't agree.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.214
Roads are blocked.
No one's getting out.

11:12.298 --> 11:14.300
There's no need for this
to end badly.

11:14.383 --> 11:17.470
Well, that depends on
how you define "badly."

11:17.553 --> 11:18.846
That ball's in your court.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.140
I'm not going anywhere.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.311
You're a fugitive
from justice.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.855
Eventually, we'll have to
come in and get you.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.232
Well, it won't be
without a fight,

11:30.316 --> 11:32.234
I can tell you that.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.198
I see women and children
back there.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.076
You really gonna put them
in harm's way?

11:40.159 --> 11:41.452
If I have to.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.170
What do you say
we at least explore

11:51.253 --> 11:55.299
the other options,
talk them through?

11:55.383 --> 11:57.301
- Talk 'em through, huh?
- Yeah.

11:57.385 --> 12:00.096
Do it right over there,
in plain sight of everyone.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.400
Hey. Where you going?

12:12.483 --> 12:15.069
I have to think about it.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.404
O'Keefe!

12:16.487 --> 12:18.280
I said I'll think about it.

12:27.832 --> 12:29.291
You don't have him
in custody?

12:29.375 --> 12:31.001
<i>No, he's back
in the house.</i>

12:31.085 --> 12:32.461
<i>Well, why didn't you grab him?</i>

12:32.545 --> 12:34.338
I told you, David,
there were guns drawn.

12:34.422 --> 12:36.715
<i>We're at some sort of
family compound.</i>

12:36.799 --> 12:38.050
<i>I'm not sure
who all lives here.</i>

12:38.134 --> 12:40.177
FBI's trying to establish that.

12:40.261 --> 12:42.805
But there are definitely
children.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.598
<i>Trying to avoid an incident.</i>

12:44.682 --> 12:46.684
So what do you want
from us?

12:46.767 --> 12:49.228
<i>Authority to negotiate terms
for O'Keefe's surrender.</i>

12:53.023 --> 12:54.567
Fine.

12:54.650 --> 12:57.194
- Anything within reason.
- Also, I need the FBI Director

12:57.278 --> 12:59.447
to order his people around here
to lay back.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.032
O'Keefe's been making them
look like idiots for six weeks,

13:02.116 --> 13:04.201
and they're in the mood
to break heads.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.916
Before we go in,
maybe you should tell me

13:11.000 --> 13:12.751
what's on your mind.

13:15.004 --> 13:17.506
We could end this right now.

13:17.590 --> 13:20.509
- How?
- By dropping all charges.

13:20.593 --> 13:23.596
Tell Saul and the FBI
to pick up and walk away.

13:23.679 --> 13:27.016
You mean let O'Keefe go?

13:27.099 --> 13:28.893
You really believe
that's the best move

13:28.976 --> 13:30.728
after all the shit
he's pulled?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.771
It is the only sure way

13:32.855 --> 13:34.940
to keep the situation
from going sideways.

13:35.024 --> 13:36.692
Saul can handle it.

13:36.775 --> 13:40.905
He said guns were
already drawn.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.366
Brett O'Keefe is a menace.

13:44.450 --> 13:46.368
I want him in custody.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.166
Madam President.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.466
What have we got?

14:00.549 --> 14:04.428
- Good morning, Madam President.
- Good morning.

14:04.512 --> 14:06.347
We have
a time-sensitive matter

14:06.430 --> 14:07.932
we need to bring
to your attention,

14:08.015 --> 14:11.185
not on the agenda.

14:13.646 --> 14:15.189
Okay.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.900
We have fresh intel that Assad
is mounting an offensive

14:17.983 --> 14:19.610
against the Free Syrian Army.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.446
We've been tracking
an arms shipment from Iran.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.198
It's on its way to
a weapons depot

14:24.281 --> 14:25.950
on the outskirts of
Al-Salamiyah.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.537
Now we can hit that convoy
before it gets there.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.997
Excuse me, General,
this is the same briefing

14:32.081 --> 14:33.874
I got last week.

14:33.958 --> 14:35.668
It's been updated, ma'am.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.002
Updated how?

14:37.086 --> 14:38.671
We have three
new strike scenarios,

14:38.754 --> 14:42.841
including one scrambling
F-15E Eagles out of Incirlik.

14:44.552 --> 14:46.470
The intelligence
is the same, though--

14:46.554 --> 14:50.349
a shipment of weapons on
its way from Iran to Syria.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.518
Yes, ma'am.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.187
So what makes you think
I've changed my mind?

14:55.271 --> 14:56.939
Because as far as
I can tell,

14:57.022 --> 14:59.108
this is exactly
the recommendation

14:59.191 --> 15:02.528
I rejected on Friday,
right?

15:02.611 --> 15:05.864
- With respect, Madam President--
- Answer me. Am I right?

15:05.948 --> 15:09.868
Or... am I missing
something here?

15:12.663 --> 15:15.082
No, ma'am. You're--
you're right, ma'am.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.459
Then I ask again,

15:17.543 --> 15:20.421
what makes you think
I've changed my position?

15:24.925 --> 15:28.596
- I see that you haven't.
- Correct.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.016
And however
politically vulnerable

15:32.099 --> 15:35.060
you may or may not think I am,

15:35.144 --> 15:37.396
all of you,

15:37.479 --> 15:40.274
don't think for a second
that I will be leveraged

15:40.357 --> 15:42.526
or back away
from the military drawdown

15:42.610 --> 15:46.614
I announced on the very first
day of my candidacy.

15:48.449 --> 15:51.952
So let's not waste
any more time on this.

15:52.036 --> 15:53.704
Moving on.

16:06.925 --> 16:11.930
Uh, I have to apologize,
dragging you all into this.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.726
Well...
we knew it could happen.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.020
"Someday." That's...

16:18.103 --> 16:20.272
that's very different
from "today."

16:22.524 --> 16:25.402
What you wanna do?

16:27.363 --> 16:30.115
Well, I'm tryin'
to figure that out.

16:32.076 --> 16:34.787
That man out there,
Saul Berenson--

16:34.870 --> 16:38.999
he is the national security
advisor to the president.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.502
Her right hand, practically.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.254
That means
we are high priority,

16:44.338 --> 16:46.256
we are big fuckin' news,

16:46.340 --> 16:48.967
and where I come from,
that's a good thing.

16:50.678 --> 16:54.098
If their plan was
to take me by force,

16:54.181 --> 16:56.684
they would've
done it already,

16:56.767 --> 16:59.895
out there just now,
but they didn't.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.523
Here we are, inside,

17:02.606 --> 17:03.941
chatting away.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.652
They are outside.
holding their dicks.

17:08.612 --> 17:12.157
It's an interesting
situation.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.369
I just don't know how long
it can last, though,

17:15.452 --> 17:19.123
this gentlemanly standoff.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.375
We are so outnumbered.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.504
We don't have to be.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.727
So what's the plan?

17:40.686 --> 17:42.146
Brett.

17:42.229 --> 17:46.108
Berenson says
he wants to talk.

17:50.738 --> 17:52.865
I'm gonna talk.

17:52.948 --> 17:56.785
Saul.

17:56.869 --> 17:58.162
Ten minutes!

18:32.279 --> 18:34.531
Hello?

18:34.615 --> 18:35.741
Hello?

19:24.039 --> 19:26.124
Maggie?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.635
I've been calling you
for the past hour.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.100
Anybody here?

19:43.183 --> 19:45.519
Um, I don't...

19:45.602 --> 19:47.813
No.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.232
- What's wrong with you?
- I was asleep.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.859
Well, you need
a cup of coffee or something?

19:51.942 --> 19:53.151
No.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.404
I ran down that photo
you sent me.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.406
I thought I was
supposed to fuck off

19:57.489 --> 19:58.699
and never call you again.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.034
Simone Martin.
Born outside Paris.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.870
Graduated from
the London School of Economics.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.706
Met David Wellington in Budapest
four years ago.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.499
They've been involved
on and off ever since.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.167
She works for an NGO called

20:09.251 --> 20:11.545
the International Democracy
Foundation.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.922
Four months ago, she moved back
to their Washington office.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.716
- Listen...
- It gets better.

20:15.799 --> 20:19.511
Stop. I can't help you
with this. It's interesting.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.179
I-I-I hope
you find something.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.932
What are you talking about?

20:28.979 --> 20:32.441
I'm sick, and...

20:34.234 --> 20:36.361
I'm gonna be sick
for a while.

20:36.445 --> 20:37.362
What does that mean?

20:39.364 --> 20:42.326
- You have to leave me alone.
- Fuck that.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.870
Go get in my car. We'll get
you some antibiotics.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.623
- Leave you alone...
- I'm sorry.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.208
You were ready to torch
my career for the revolution.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.877
Take a shower.
Let's get on with it.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.352
I'm bipolar.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.730
And my drug protocol
is fucked up, so...

21:11.813 --> 21:15.317
There's a whole
process that has to happen,

21:15.400 --> 21:19.571
and it does not include
me doing this.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.285
Okay.

21:25.369 --> 21:27.245
Part of being manic

21:27.329 --> 21:30.874
is seeing connections
everywhere.

21:30.958 --> 21:35.712
Some of it's made my career,
but some of it's just...

21:35.796 --> 21:40.092
...nightmares that don't stop
when you're awake.

21:40.175 --> 21:44.763
So yes. This administration
is messing with civil procedure,

21:44.846 --> 21:47.307
but...

21:47.391 --> 21:50.394
this nefarious shit
that I'm ascribing

21:50.477 --> 21:54.356
to the president
and David Wellington is just...

21:54.439 --> 21:58.068
What? You think
you made it up?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.906
That's what happens.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.537
A vehicle registered
to this woman

22:08.620 --> 22:10.706
was issued a parking ticket
on March 30th

22:10.789 --> 22:12.708
in Hazelton, West Virginia.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.501
That's three miles
from the prison

22:14.584 --> 22:16.211
where General McClendon
was sentenced

22:16.294 --> 22:17.796
to spend
the rest of his life.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.799
It's also
the day before he died.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.512
And yeah,
I know where she lives,

22:25.595 --> 22:27.472
in case you're wondering.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.391
Must be a slow week
in Washington

23:11.475 --> 23:13.101
if the president sends

23:13.185 --> 23:15.687
her new National Security
Advisor down here.

23:15.771 --> 23:18.148
You don't have anything
better to do?

23:18.231 --> 23:22.110
Defeat ISIS? Bring peace
to the Middle East?

23:24.696 --> 23:27.866
Most urgent national security
issue right now is you.

23:27.949 --> 23:30.827
Me? Really?

23:30.911 --> 23:33.038
Wow!

23:33.121 --> 23:35.665
Just so we're clear,

23:35.749 --> 23:38.502
all I've done,
all I am doing

23:38.585 --> 23:40.879
is exercising
my First Amendment rights,

23:40.962 --> 23:44.341
for which I have been
slandered, persecuted, hunted--

23:44.424 --> 23:48.220
How about gettin' down
off that high horse?

23:48.303 --> 23:51.431
- Just the two of us here.
- Just the two of us, huh?

23:51.515 --> 23:54.559
There are
federal sharpshooters

23:54.643 --> 23:56.937
out there right now.

23:57.020 --> 24:01.024
Jesus, I can-- I can practically
feel the gun sights.

24:01.108 --> 24:03.777
One false move... Pow!

24:08.782 --> 24:10.909
Nobody's gonna shoot you,
O'Keefe.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.119
Not yet, anyway.

24:12.202 --> 24:14.788
Then lose the rifles.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.957
Just as soon as your people do.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.042
Well, that hardly
seems fair, does it?

24:19.126 --> 24:21.002
Well, I'm not the one
breaking the law.

24:21.086 --> 24:24.047
- I beg your pardon?
- Isn't that what you're doing?

24:26.675 --> 24:29.511
Well, I'd like to think
I'm filling a void,

24:29.594 --> 24:30.846
the one vacated by

24:30.929 --> 24:32.764
the walking dead
and decrepit media.

24:32.848 --> 24:35.392
Come on. You're smart.
You don't really believe that.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.477
Oh, I do.

24:37.561 --> 24:40.438
- I do. People are angry.
- So you keep saying.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.482
Maybe they'd be
a little less angry

24:42.566 --> 24:44.359
and a little more reasonable,
these people,

24:44.442 --> 24:46.611
if you stopped peddling
your outright falsehoods,

24:46.695 --> 24:48.530
conspiracy theories...

24:48.613 --> 24:51.449
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Seriously.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.285
You're poisoning
the conversation.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.203
What conversation?

24:55.287 --> 25:00.167
We haven't had a conversation
in this country for 50 years.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.003
Not since "these people,"
as you keep calling them,

25:03.086 --> 25:05.338
got sent to fight the war
in Vietnam.

25:05.422 --> 25:07.841
Not since their children
were bussed to schools

25:07.924 --> 25:09.301
in the ghetto.

25:09.384 --> 25:11.678
Not since their jobs
were shipped overseas.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.514
Not since the Christian values
they cherish

25:14.598 --> 25:17.893
were trashed and ridiculed

25:17.976 --> 25:20.103
in favor of every boy
who thinks he's a girl

25:20.187 --> 25:23.190
or girl who thinks she's
a boy--well, fuck that.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.114
Fair enough.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.782
"Fair enough"?

25:35.118 --> 25:37.370
Every one of those things
you just mentioned

25:37.454 --> 25:39.497
is worth talking about,
debating.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.626
Hear, hear.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.961
Instead, you're out there
accusing the president

25:45.045 --> 25:49.841
of murdering General McClendon,
calling for a revolution.

25:49.925 --> 25:51.676
Hey...

25:51.760 --> 25:54.262
I serve my audience.

25:54.346 --> 25:58.225
- That's your answer?
- That's the American way.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.310
Nothing ever got done
in this country

26:00.393 --> 26:01.895
by civil discourse alone.

26:01.978 --> 26:04.564
The loud get heard.
They always have.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.610
They also fall the hardest.

26:10.403 --> 26:14.032
Come and get me. Go ahead.

26:14.115 --> 26:17.452
Send in the storm troopers.
We'll see what happens.

26:17.535 --> 26:19.204
The world is watching.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.705
Not for long.

26:20.789 --> 26:23.208
What do you mean?

26:23.291 --> 26:25.168
Once we shut down
your broadcast,

26:25.252 --> 26:27.212
jam your communications,

26:27.295 --> 26:29.256
you'll be
completely cut off.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.682
Here's the truth.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.434
You will never be in
a stronger negotiating position

26:41.518 --> 26:43.436
than you are right now.

26:46.690 --> 26:50.277
Tell me what you want.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.321
What's it gonna take for you
to walk outta here?

27:14.175 --> 27:16.261
- Still on the phone?
- Mm-hmm.

27:25.145 --> 27:28.773
I had an ex
who was bipolar.

27:29.774 --> 27:32.319
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.988
It sucks.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.157
I'm sorry you have to
deal with that.

27:40.285 --> 27:44.289
- Is that why you broke up?
- No.

27:44.372 --> 27:48.043
You can say it. It's not
gonna hurt my feelings.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.295
We broke up 'cause
I drank too much.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.841
Why'd you drink?

27:56.718 --> 27:58.053
Kabul.

28:00.221 --> 28:02.682
Boredom after.

28:02.766 --> 28:05.352
Did you stop?

28:05.435 --> 28:07.228
No.

28:07.312 --> 28:08.688
I didn't.

28:10.940 --> 28:13.068
It's under control.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.196
That's what I told
my sister.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.073
Then she sent me
to the shrink.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.703
Is it?

28:23.787 --> 28:25.205
Under control?

28:29.376 --> 28:31.252
Not really.

28:33.421 --> 28:36.174
Took Audrey forever
to figure out the drugs.

28:36.257 --> 28:38.343
Years of messing
with dosages and diet

28:38.426 --> 28:41.012
and does she drink or not?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.682
And there were
times when...

28:50.021 --> 28:53.817
We had
some bad days but...

28:53.900 --> 28:56.861
Eventually she got
her head straight.

28:56.945 --> 28:58.988
Just in time to leave me.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.957
Hey. She's on the move.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.967
- What are you doing?
- Go ahead.
I'm gonna look around.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.094
- Get back in the car.
- Don't worry about it.

29:21.177 --> 29:22.595
- You're half asleep.
- You're gonna lose her.

29:22.679 --> 29:24.222
You need to go.

31:53.830 --> 31:56.165
<i>I know he's attacked you
personally, ma'am,</i>

31:56.249 --> 31:57.542
<i>but I think
there's an opportunity</i>

31:57.625 --> 31:58.960
<i>to be generous here.</i>

31:59.043 --> 32:00.503
<i>What are the terms?</i>

32:00.587 --> 32:03.089
Amnesty for everyone
who's provided

32:03.172 --> 32:04.882
safe harbor for him.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.095
- Okay.
<i>- Including a woman who's been</i>

32:09.178 --> 32:13.057
<i>traveling with him,
uh, Sharon Aldright.</i>

32:13.141 --> 32:14.642
<i>Anything else?</i>

32:16.644 --> 32:18.438
He wants a televised trial.

32:18.521 --> 32:21.691
I am not giving that lunatic
a megaphone.

32:21.774 --> 32:24.068
<i>He's already got one,
Madam President.</i>

32:24.152 --> 32:26.446
What this deal does is
take it away.

32:26.529 --> 32:28.323
How do you figure?

32:28.406 --> 32:31.409
He'll have half the country
tuning in all day, every day.

32:31.492 --> 32:35.246
Slowroll the preliminaries.
And that'll be two years before

32:35.330 --> 32:37.957
anybody sees the inside
of a courtroom.

32:38.041 --> 32:40.585
<i>That's a lifetime
from now if you ask me,</i>

32:40.668 --> 32:42.295
hopefully forgotten by then.

32:42.378 --> 32:44.631
His audience
will have dried up.

32:44.714 --> 32:47.967
Do all the grandstanding he
wants. There won't be anybody--

32:48.051 --> 32:51.679
I'm proud of you.
You're doing the right thing.

32:51.763 --> 32:53.181
Not so fast.

32:53.264 --> 32:55.099
What do you mean?

32:55.183 --> 32:57.226
Keane hasn't agreed
to anything yet.

32:58.728 --> 33:01.189
Berenson's still on
the phone with her.

33:01.272 --> 33:04.984
- She will.
- Don't be so sure.

33:05.068 --> 33:07.320
Okay.

33:08.780 --> 33:12.158
Well, we're gonna find out
soon enough anyway.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.285
Plus I'm not so hot
all of a sudden

33:14.369 --> 33:16.329
on the idea
of going to prison.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.539
Why are you assuming
that's what's gonna happen?

33:19.916 --> 33:22.502
Why wouldn't I assume that?

33:22.585 --> 33:25.088
There's a trial
to get through first.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.882
And the point is,
you did nothing wrong.

33:27.965 --> 33:29.509
You didn't know anything
about a plot

33:29.592 --> 33:32.679
to assassinate
the president, right?

33:32.762 --> 33:34.180
Brett?

33:34.263 --> 33:35.598
Yeah, of course not.

33:35.682 --> 33:39.352
Well, then, you have
nothing to worry about.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.688
Well, she had McClendon
poisoned, didn't she?

33:41.771 --> 33:45.358
Oh, come on, Brett,
not even you believe that.

33:45.441 --> 33:47.527
You know, you're
the second person today

33:47.610 --> 33:50.238
who's told me that.

33:50.321 --> 33:53.282
The other one's
right out there,

33:53.366 --> 33:56.452
no idea what's about
to hit him.

33:57.995 --> 34:00.373
- What are you talking about?
- Let's just say,

34:00.456 --> 34:03.292
I'd take your bags
back upstairs if I were you.

34:04.669 --> 34:07.672
We're not going anywhere
just yet.

34:38.286 --> 34:41.789
<i>- Uh, 10-15.</i>
- Excuse me, ma'am?

34:41.873 --> 34:45.126
Hi.

34:45.209 --> 34:47.170
- You live around here?
- No.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.504
What are you
doing here today?

34:48.588 --> 34:51.132
I'm meeting a friend.
Starbucks.

34:51.215 --> 34:53.384
- Nothing else?
- Like what?

34:53.468 --> 34:56.304
Someone was seen breaking into
an apartment down the block.

34:56.387 --> 34:57.847
You match the description.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.849
Yeah. That...

34:59.932 --> 35:01.768
I was not breaking
into an apartment.

35:01.851 --> 35:06.189
I mean, I-I was. I'm--
I'm feeding my friend's cat.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.357
Um, she's out of town,

35:08.441 --> 35:10.610
and I forgot the keys
at home like an idiot.

35:10.693 --> 35:12.987
So-so I went through
the window. I'm sorry.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.530
I didn't mean to freak
anybody out.

35:14.614 --> 35:16.407
You mind if I give
your friend a call?

35:16.491 --> 35:19.368
- Just to confirm?
- Well, she's out of the country.

35:19.452 --> 35:21.370
That's why I have to feed
the stupid cat.

35:21.454 --> 35:22.705
What's her name?

35:25.458 --> 35:28.252
I don't wanna give you
her name.

35:28.336 --> 35:31.088
She's had immigration issues,
frankly,

35:31.172 --> 35:33.716
and the last thing she needs
is to be on your radar.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.803
- What's your name?
- Yeah, I really have to go.

35:36.886 --> 35:39.680
Ma'am. You were spotted
breaking into an apartment.

35:39.764 --> 35:41.599
We're gonna need
some information.

35:41.682 --> 35:43.976
Do I look like a burglar?
Go through my pockets.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.062
I have a phone
and some ChapStick.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.772
Someone called it in,
so I'm gonna need you

35:47.855 --> 35:49.690
to make a statement
down at the precinct either way.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.484
The precinct?
This is ridiculous.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.694
I have to pick up my kid
from school.

35:53.778 --> 35:55.530
You're refusing to provide us
with your name.

35:55.613 --> 35:56.989
I could cite you
just for that.

35:57.073 --> 35:58.866
So how 'bout you step
into the car

35:58.950 --> 36:01.077
and just explain what happened
down at the precinct?

36:11.754 --> 36:14.006
Down on the ground!

36:14.090 --> 36:16.342
No, wait! Wait, don't shoot,
don't shoot, don't shoot!

36:16.425 --> 36:18.469
I'm Sharon Aldright!
I work with Brett O'Keefe!

36:18.553 --> 36:20.346
- Where is he?
- He's not coming.

36:20.429 --> 36:22.557
- Look, there's something
going on in there.
- What?

36:22.640 --> 36:24.433
I don't know, but I know that
there's reinforcements

36:24.517 --> 36:26.352
coming in now.

36:26.435 --> 36:29.063
Let's go! Let's go! Hey!

36:29.146 --> 36:30.731
Close the road. Shut it down.
Set up a perimeter.

36:30.815 --> 36:33.192
I need ten of you!
Now! Let's move!

36:33.276 --> 36:35.903
Saul! Saul!

36:35.987 --> 36:38.531
Saul!

36:38.614 --> 36:40.449
Get out of there! Run!

36:40.533 --> 36:42.869
Run!

36:50.626 --> 36:52.253
Let him go!

36:52.336 --> 36:54.881
I don't think so!
Get him back to the house.

36:54.964 --> 36:57.884
Nobody move!

36:57.967 --> 37:00.970
I said let him go, or we'll
slaughter you where you stand.

37:02.555 --> 37:05.182
Come on!

37:09.979 --> 37:11.898
I got snipers
in the woods, pal.

37:11.981 --> 37:14.108
Every one of you is
a dead man two times over.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.402
- Maslin...
- No, shut it, Saul.

37:16.485 --> 37:17.778
You got five seconds.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.699
Four, three...

37:22.950 --> 37:25.328
- Two...
- Let him go.

37:33.961 --> 37:36.297
You, too, tough guy.
Put your weapons down.

37:36.380 --> 37:40.718
- You're under arrest.
- Fuck you. You want us?

37:40.801 --> 37:43.471
You're gonna have to shoot us
in the back. Let's go.

38:00.237 --> 38:04.200
You know,
just for the record,

38:04.283 --> 38:06.494
I told you so.

38:12.291 --> 38:16.420
Hey. Good. Good.

38:31.268 --> 38:33.354
My kid's gonna be sitting on
the curb by herself.

38:33.437 --> 38:34.689
Is there someone
we can call for you?

38:34.772 --> 38:36.857
No, there isn't.
I'm a single mother.

38:36.941 --> 38:39.193
- We get a name yet?
- Nothing yet.

38:39.276 --> 38:41.070
Okay, this is
a misunderstanding,

38:41.153 --> 38:43.656
and your officers are
completely overreacting.

38:43.739 --> 38:46.784
I'm 100% sure that's true.

38:46.867 --> 38:49.870
- Right this way, please.
- Well, I just told them,

38:49.954 --> 38:51.539
my kid is waiting for me
at school to pick her up.

38:51.622 --> 38:55.042
Okay, okay, we'll talk about it.
In here, please.

39:01.007 --> 39:03.467
Have a seat. Please.

39:05.344 --> 39:08.222
Can I see some I.D.?
Maybe a driver's license.

39:08.305 --> 39:10.349
- There's nothing on me.
- Sorry.

39:10.433 --> 39:12.518
Tell me your name, please.

39:12.601 --> 39:17.398
I wanna see your
commanding officer right now.

39:17.481 --> 39:20.276
You realize, if I can't get
basic information out of you,

39:20.359 --> 39:22.194
this just goes downhill.

39:28.451 --> 39:30.953
Listen, the apartment thing
was a mix-up.

39:31.037 --> 39:33.789
I need you to believe me.
I can't end up in your system.

39:40.254 --> 39:42.381
I have
a six-year-old daughter,

39:42.465 --> 39:45.760
and I'm in the middle
of a...

39:45.843 --> 39:49.180
very ugly custody battle.
So if I have an arrest

39:49.263 --> 39:51.557
on my record, they're gonna...

39:51.640 --> 39:53.476
they're gonna take my kid
away from me.

39:53.559 --> 39:57.063
Do--do you understand
what I'm saying?

39:59.023 --> 40:00.775
We have to book you.

40:04.111 --> 40:06.155
But I'm gonna call someone
at Social Services

40:06.238 --> 40:07.656
- and see if they can--
- No. No, no, no. No.

40:07.740 --> 40:09.575
Tell me your name, hon.

40:09.658 --> 40:12.203
You cannot call
Social Services.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.459
- Go ahead.
- Ma'am, please come with me.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.169
No, do not book me.
Do not book me.

40:20.252 --> 40:23.964
Do not book me, please. Please.
Please. Please don't do this.

40:24.048 --> 40:27.218
Please, please, please, please.
No. Don't do this. No, no.

40:27.301 --> 40:29.512
- Hey, hey, get off of me.
- Come on.

40:29.595 --> 40:31.514
- Get off of me.
- Calm down.

40:31.597 --> 40:34.350
No. No!

40:34.433 --> 40:36.519
All right, that's enough.

40:36.602 --> 40:39.230
No, no.

40:39.313 --> 40:42.191
No.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.074
What the hell happened?
I thought it was a done deal.

40:50.157 --> 40:52.034
He was playing us
the whole time.

40:52.118 --> 40:54.036
Stalling until he could get
more guys with guns

40:54.120 --> 40:55.830
- into the compound.
- How many more?

40:55.913 --> 40:58.207
At least 30,
according to Saul.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.000
Jesus.

41:02.795 --> 41:04.588
Is it too late to walk away?

41:04.672 --> 41:08.259
Media's there in full force.
We'll take a beating.

41:08.342 --> 41:10.761
We do have a few options.

41:10.845 --> 41:11.929
Such as?

41:12.012 --> 41:14.807
Well...

41:14.890 --> 41:17.434
That arms shipment
to the Assad regime--

41:17.518 --> 41:20.062
the window's still open
for an air strike.

41:20.146 --> 41:21.939
A show of strength
isn't necessarily

41:22.022 --> 41:25.526
a bad thing, Elizabeth.
Don't reject it out of hand.

41:25.609 --> 41:28.779
- I already have. Twice.
- Then take a third look.

41:28.863 --> 41:31.740
Otherwise, Brett O'Keefe is
the lead story tomorrow

41:31.824 --> 41:33.534
and the next day
and the day after that.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.661
I am not gonna blow up
a convoy in Syria

41:35.744 --> 41:37.663
in order to control
the news cycle.

41:37.746 --> 41:39.456
Then do it because it will
save lives on the ground.

41:39.540 --> 41:42.126
- Says who? General Rossen?
- If those weapons are destined

41:42.209 --> 41:43.711
for the front lines,
well, they'll be used

41:43.794 --> 41:46.630
against FSA positions
in population centers,

41:46.714 --> 41:48.674
hospitals, apartments,
schools, mosques--

41:48.757 --> 41:52.553
Okay. Okay!
Assume for a second I say yes,

41:52.636 --> 41:55.389
- where does it end?
- What do you mean?

41:55.472 --> 41:57.224
What about
the Russian supply routes?

41:57.308 --> 41:59.185
- Do I bomb those, too?
- That's your objection?

41:59.268 --> 42:01.228
That you can take out
an Iranian convoy

42:01.312 --> 42:03.689
without risking a world war,
but not a Russian one?

42:03.772 --> 42:06.317
The point is, you draw a line,
you stay behind it.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.776
Listen to yourself.

42:07.860 --> 42:09.653
You're in
a defensive crouch.

42:09.737 --> 42:12.740
You're stuck there.
You have been for months.

42:12.823 --> 42:15.868
It's bad policy.
It's wrong. It just is.

42:15.951 --> 42:18.621
I know, but you have
to do it, anyway.

42:18.704 --> 42:21.123
- Why?
- Because you won the election.

42:24.084 --> 42:28.214
Remember why you decided
to run in the first place?

42:28.297 --> 42:29.715
What you hoped to accomplish?

42:29.798 --> 42:32.176
Well, all that's
in the balance right now.

42:32.259 --> 42:36.180
You...You wanna get anything
done in the next four years,

42:36.263 --> 42:39.558
you are gonna have to fight
like hell for it,

42:39.642 --> 42:41.644
starting tonight.

42:45.773 --> 42:47.775
I'm sorry, David.
I just can't.

42:47.858 --> 42:52.112
Not like this.
I wish I could.

42:57.910 --> 42:59.662
Now let me finish this.

42:59.745 --> 43:02.122
I wanna get to bed
before midnight.

43:39.660 --> 43:42.705
Mr. Berenson.

43:42.788 --> 43:44.957
- Thanks.
- Sure.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.710
Offer you a bed for the night?

43:47.793 --> 43:50.421
We just booked a bunch of rooms
at the motel in town.

43:50.504 --> 43:52.256
- No, I'm good.
- You sure?

43:52.339 --> 43:54.508
Nothing's gonna happen here
till morning.

43:54.591 --> 43:56.093
That's what I'm afraid of.

43:58.387 --> 44:00.014
Have a good night, sir.

44:26.123 --> 44:29.126
Hey, Jane Doe.
Up. Let's go.

44:29.209 --> 44:32.129
Where am I going?
You can't take me anywhere

44:32.212 --> 44:34.548
- before I see a lawyer.
- You should shut up.

44:36.425 --> 44:37.885
Come on.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.610
Here you go.

44:54.693 --> 44:56.445
Have Wiley call me
if there's anything.

44:56.528 --> 44:57.696
Will do.

44:59.865 --> 45:02.701
What'd you do?
You posted bail?

45:02.785 --> 45:04.411
Walk.

45:48.288 --> 45:49.623
Rossen here.

45:49.706 --> 45:52.709
<i>General.
It's David Wellington.</i>

45:52.793 --> 45:54.545
<i>What can I do for you,
David?</i>

45:54.628 --> 45:56.672
The president's come around.

45:56.755 --> 45:59.675
She just approved
the Syrian mission.

45:59.758 --> 46:03.846
You have full operational
authority. Start the clock.

46:03.929 --> 46:05.431
You're aware I need
to hear this order directly

46:05.514 --> 46:07.224
from the president herself,
right?

46:07.307 --> 46:10.811
Of course. She asked if we could
skip the formalities, though.

46:10.894 --> 46:13.856
She's--she's not feeling well.
Went to bed.

46:13.939 --> 46:16.316
Well, then, it'll have to
wait until morning.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.026
<i>Okay. But...</i>

46:18.110 --> 46:21.155
there's no delicate way
to put this, General.

46:21.238 --> 46:25.033
I'm afraid she could
change her mind by morning.

46:29.121 --> 46:31.874
<i>- General?</i>
- Yes, I'm--I'm here.

46:31.957 --> 46:34.585
<i>Can I give you
the confirmation code</i>

46:34.668 --> 46:36.795
just so you have it?

46:38.922 --> 46:41.758
You say the president
authorized the strike.

46:41.842 --> 46:42.801
<i>15 minutes ago</i>

46:42.885 --> 46:44.344
in the Oval.

46:44.428 --> 46:47.222
You have my word.

46:48.599 --> 46:50.184
Okay.

46:50.267 --> 46:52.561
<i>Go ahead.</i>

46:52.644 --> 46:54.771
Stand by for
confirmation code.

46:58.859 --> 47:01.195
How'd you find me?

47:01.278 --> 47:05.365
You didn't answer your phone,
so I drove back to Simone's.

47:05.449 --> 47:08.243
No sign of you there.
Figured something happened,

47:08.327 --> 47:10.954
so... made some calls.

47:11.038 --> 47:13.707
There's no record
of the arrest?

47:13.790 --> 47:14.917
No.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.002
- At all?
- Yeah, lucky for you,

47:17.085 --> 47:19.505
I still have some juice
in this town.

47:19.588 --> 47:23.634
Not much, but...

47:23.717 --> 47:25.886
- How'd it go, by the way?
- What?

47:25.969 --> 47:28.805
At Simone's.
Find anything?

47:28.889 --> 47:31.558
Oh, yeah.
The parking ticket.

47:31.642 --> 47:33.894
I got a photo of it.

47:33.977 --> 47:35.938
Plus I downloaded
her hard drive.

47:37.022 --> 47:38.899
Then it wasn't for nothing.

47:46.907 --> 47:50.369
- Can you pull over?
- You okay?

47:50.452 --> 47:54.122
Just need some air.

48:07.177 --> 48:10.222
Carrie?

48:10.305 --> 48:12.349
I'm fine.

48:12.432 --> 48:15.185
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

48:15.269 --> 48:19.398
I just--
I just need a second.

48:19.481 --> 48:22.025
Take your time.

48:33.495 --> 48:36.748
I had some difficulty with
Child Protective Services

48:36.832 --> 48:38.625
a few months ago, so...

48:40.961 --> 48:43.422
An arrest on my record
would've been...

48:46.216 --> 48:48.677
Would've
been really problematic.

49:01.106 --> 49:02.524
Wanna sit for a minute?
