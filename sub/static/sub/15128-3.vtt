00:03.366 --> 00:06.317
55 lives given up for unregistered

00:06.336 --> 00:08.759
and anonymous bearer bonds.

00:10.499 --> 00:12.207
Does this buy back a life?

00:12.370 --> 00:14.610
She was being held prisoner in a cellar.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.733
Who is she?

00:16.065 --> 00:17.604
The girl is Reid's daughter.

00:17.724 --> 00:19.250
I will do right by the girl.

00:19.284 --> 00:20.641
What is it you ask of me?

00:20.643 --> 00:22.559
There was nothing that
could be done for the child.

00:22.616 --> 00:24.200
She was buried this morning.

00:24.267 --> 00:26.247
Tell us about your cellar, Mr. Buckley.

00:26.367 --> 00:29.076
- Who was she?!
- Matilda Reid.

00:29.576 --> 00:31.085
How could you keep her from me?

00:31.205 --> 00:32.464
You...

00:32.822 --> 00:35.290
never loved her the way I did.

00:35.329 --> 00:37.251
Reid, do not to this, brother.

00:37.307 --> 00:39.757
You couldn't love her
enough to keep her then.

00:40.335 --> 00:41.414
Edmund!

00:46.386 --> 00:47.245
Inspector.

00:47.897 --> 00:49.621
You may have five minutes.

00:49.902 --> 00:50.987
I can give no more.

00:58.206 --> 01:01.037
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:02.717 --> 01:04.268
My name

01:04.515 --> 01:06.204
is Alexander Le Cheyne,

01:07.117 --> 01:08.904
and in this place,

01:09.747 --> 01:11.342
at this moment...

01:12.366 --> 01:14.166
we are not alone.

01:14.376 --> 01:17.247
Your lost ones, those you grieve,

01:17.504 --> 01:21.056
those whose absence
cuts deep like a blade...

01:21.058 --> 01:22.950
the face, the voice,

01:23.070 --> 01:26.311
the touch which seem forever forsaken...

01:26.450 --> 01:28.084
they are here,

01:28.494 --> 01:30.169
all around us,

01:30.584 --> 01:31.933
with us now.

01:34.809 --> 01:37.827
Amid the secret hidden vapors of this world

01:37.872 --> 01:41.057
the shimmer and languish and yearn unseen.

01:41.311 --> 01:45.397
In this let I be your
humble servant and medium,

01:46.190 --> 01:47.821
for your lost ones,

01:48.171 --> 01:50.138
they are not lost.

01:51.071 --> 01:52.387
They are here.

01:53.254 --> 01:55.625
They are not lost.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.896
I feel him.

02:14.585 --> 02:18.272
He's in pain, Mrs. Wakefield.

02:19.216 --> 02:20.466
A pain that

02:20.586 --> 02:23.609
only your love can salve and balm.

02:24.555 --> 02:27.785
The locomotive calamity
which tore him from you was

02:27.890 --> 02:29.331
so sudden, so...

02:31.199 --> 02:33.079
so cruel.

02:34.565 --> 02:36.081
I love you, William.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.542
He knows, Madame.

02:39.870 --> 02:41.736
Your William knows.

02:42.819 --> 02:44.897
Oh. He...

02:45.017 --> 02:47.131
he would use me as conduit that

02:47.138 --> 02:49.617
you may know his voice from beyond.

02:51.794 --> 02:52.997
Oh.

02:53.117 --> 02:54.589
Will you permit that?

02:57.637 --> 02:58.753
Mr. Marvell,

02:58.755 --> 03:00.297
if you please.

03:13.386 --> 03:15.241
I see him.

03:23.229 --> 03:24.545
Oh!

03:25.360 --> 03:27.137
I...

03:32.689 --> 03:33.788
He's...

03:33.908 --> 03:35.220
Oh!

03:45.297 --> 03:46.505
Help.

03:52.910 --> 03:54.827
- Alex!
- Mr. Le Cheyne!

04:43.298 --> 04:50.032
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:53.642 --> 04:55.657
It is offered to you, then?

04:56.285 --> 04:57.891
This room?

04:58.565 --> 05:00.285
Mr. Reid's position,

05:01.297 --> 05:02.645
effective immediate.

05:03.025 --> 05:04.486
What you came back for,

05:04.495 --> 05:07.235
- ain't it?
- Not like this, Donald.

05:09.079 --> 05:11.238
Be that as it may, Inspector,

05:11.358 --> 05:13.537
the division needs a man behind that desk,

05:13.657 --> 05:15.503
and who better, Bennet?

05:15.977 --> 05:17.910
These streets are your marrow.

05:22.578 --> 05:25.923
Abberline comes here today.

05:31.268 --> 05:33.796
He inquires about the killing of Buckley.

05:39.985 --> 05:41.706
Bennet, we spoke of this.

05:42.303 --> 05:44.492
Abberline may once have coppered here,

05:44.612 --> 05:47.134
but this day, he comes as Yard.

05:49.142 --> 05:51.530
With the inspector still absent

05:52.302 --> 05:54.670
with no word, we have a duty to him.

05:54.867 --> 05:58.044
The inspector would say it is
our duty to do what's right.

05:58.963 --> 06:00.542
And so it is,

06:01.699 --> 06:05.430
and what is right is to protect
the inspector's good name.

06:13.428 --> 06:14.537
The girl.

06:15.273 --> 06:16.874
His little Matilda.

06:18.065 --> 06:19.520
Should we exhume,

06:20.161 --> 06:21.801
bury her proper-like?

06:21.998 --> 06:23.886
If the inspector returns,

06:24.279 --> 06:25.824
it is a choice for him.

06:26.509 --> 06:28.138
While the choice is mine,

06:29.391 --> 06:31.528
the dead shall have their peace.

06:37.976 --> 06:40.622
Inspector, thank you for coming so swiftly.

06:40.742 --> 06:42.280
Ain't just Inspector.

06:42.330 --> 06:44.561
It's Head of Division,
ain't that right, Benneto?

06:45.128 --> 06:46.083
Sir.

06:46.696 --> 06:48.032
Hail to the chief.

06:49.088 --> 06:49.976
What happened?

06:50.268 --> 06:52.487
We got ourselves a dead clairvoyant.

06:52.976 --> 06:54.375
Never saw it coming.

06:54.796 --> 06:55.875
Oh, William.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.695
- William.
- Mrs. Wakefield.

07:00.076 --> 07:01.986
Le Cheyne here was channeling the spirit

07:02.011 --> 07:03.581
of her dearly departed when he dropped.

07:03.598 --> 07:05.991
Scared her shitless. I had to dope her.

07:06.569 --> 07:07.964
William was here.

07:08.491 --> 07:10.643
I... I felt him.

07:10.924 --> 07:12.570
I saw a...

07:13.389 --> 07:14.727
I saw his light.

07:16.075 --> 07:18.070
It was the light of his love.

07:18.834 --> 07:19.890
He was killed.

07:19.913 --> 07:21.441
The train crash, she said.

07:22.930 --> 07:25.182
I'll have a constable show
you home, Mrs. Wakefield.

07:25.508 --> 07:27.969
He was a spirit-worker, all right.

07:29.019 --> 07:30.985
And this here...

07:32.058 --> 07:33.665
That's your light of love.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.771
Oil of phosphorus.

07:37.064 --> 07:38.726
Don't touch that.

07:42.772 --> 07:44.586
It's a nice grift you boys got going.

07:44.620 --> 07:45.817
Grift, sir?

07:45.890 --> 07:46.963
Who's this?

07:47.083 --> 07:48.233
Sidekick.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.799
Partner and apprentice to Mr. Le Cheyne.

07:51.198 --> 07:52.665
Ezra Marvell, sir.

07:52.785 --> 07:54.687
He says Le Cheyne here was fit as a horse.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.692
It is no malady of the body but his gift

07:57.812 --> 07:59.850
which today lays him low

08:00.855 --> 08:03.967
and snuffs from the
world a light so bright.

08:06.484 --> 08:09.439
Mr. Wakefield perished in
the locomotive disaster.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.434
His spirit is agonized.

08:11.970 --> 08:14.750
Mrs. Wakefield had become a regular client,

08:15.074 --> 08:18.328
sought to soothe her husband,
to guide him toward peace.

08:19.182 --> 08:20.502
Mr. Le Cheyne

08:20.811 --> 08:22.547
communed with William,

08:22.720 --> 08:23.889
but also,

08:24.009 --> 08:25.289
with his pain.

08:27.177 --> 08:28.778
But it was too much even

08:29.363 --> 08:31.716
for this great man to bear.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.188
Well, he was in shape.

08:33.308 --> 08:36.333
At least he was. If I was a
gambling man, I'd bet on poison,

08:36.453 --> 08:38.727
and I am a gambling man.

08:38.902 --> 08:40.395
Then let's get him to the dead room.

08:40.452 --> 08:42.850
Why don't we just ask Merlin
here to powwow with his spirit?

08:42.895 --> 08:45.350
- Sir, do not make light.
- Did Mr. Le Cheyne

08:45.366 --> 08:47.665
make enemies in his line
of work? Did he, sir?

08:48.074 --> 08:50.950
Anyone who might come
to doubt the honor of it?

08:51.070 --> 08:52.523
Doubt, sir?

08:52.888 --> 08:54.388
There is none.

08:58.147 --> 08:59.287
Who's the girl?

09:00.916 --> 09:03.928
Mr. Le Cheyne and I kept affairs
beyond our work for ourselves.

09:03.939 --> 09:05.569
Wait a minute. I know her.

09:06.260 --> 09:07.968
Edgar, take a look at this.

09:09.289 --> 09:10.160
Yes.

09:10.935 --> 09:13.053
Yes, that's one of our ballet girls. Um...

09:13.445 --> 09:15.659
Ah... Juniper, I believe. Juniper Kohl.

09:15.698 --> 09:16.542
Is she here?

09:16.650 --> 09:17.844
She was rehearsing this morning.

09:18.041 --> 09:18.783
Some of the girls

09:18.794 --> 09:21.502
pour pints at the Ten Bells
for a little extra coin.

09:21.676 --> 09:23.150
Thank you, Miss Morton.

09:23.469 --> 09:26.086
Now, we may be talking again, Mr. Marvell.

09:26.206 --> 09:28.137
Drake, just a moment.

09:33.228 --> 09:34.755
Any word of Reid?

09:35.834 --> 09:38.682
Abberline comes today to inquire.

09:38.862 --> 09:40.800
My autopsy report's been sewn up,

09:40.834 --> 09:43.187
so until then, you just
keep your powder dry, okay?

09:44.573 --> 09:46.346
And, ah, Drake...

09:47.043 --> 09:49.032
Reid stays gone, there
are worse men for the job,

09:49.054 --> 09:50.537
if you know what I'm saying.

09:58.415 --> 10:00.611
I'd like you to stay backstage.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.230
- How is he?
- Yeah, full of chuckles.

10:05.661 --> 10:07.689
Uneasy lies the head, darling.

10:08.830 --> 10:11.285
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.

10:31.444 --> 10:33.220
I'm looking for a girl named Juniper.

10:33.253 --> 10:35.029
- Told she works here.
- Oh.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.451
You set my ears afire, sir.

10:37.777 --> 10:39.382
What will you be drinking?

10:39.810 --> 10:41.666
He was a good man, Alexander.

10:42.479 --> 10:44.237
But it was difficult with...

10:45.911 --> 10:47.170
with Ezra.

10:48.709 --> 10:49.945
Were you...

10:50.597 --> 10:53.293
stepping out with Ezra Marvell, too?

10:54.254 --> 10:55.436
Ezra and I...

10:55.438 --> 10:57.524
in the past, that is, we...

10:59.749 --> 11:01.392
then I met Alexander Le Cheyne.

11:01.917 --> 11:04.255
Mr. Marvell gave out he didn't know you.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.036
It was difficult for Ezra.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.051
He felt like Alexander
had all of the limelight,

11:10.401 --> 11:12.384
that he was always waiting in shadow,

11:12.418 --> 11:14.421
no more than a sidekick.

11:15.171 --> 11:17.225
And then Alexander had me, too.

11:18.756 --> 11:20.578
Ezra would tell people

11:21.458 --> 11:23.553
I got on my back to get ahead.

11:24.654 --> 11:27.452
Called me a whore in a tutu. He was...

11:27.795 --> 11:29.963
jealous, Inspector,

11:30.345 --> 11:31.373
and bitter.

11:31.493 --> 11:33.755
How jealous, do you think?

11:39.711 --> 11:41.318
Threatened him once.

11:42.004 --> 11:43.992
When Alexander and I first...

11:45.787 --> 11:47.319
he said he'd destroy him.

11:47.589 --> 11:49.291
I mean, just words, but...

11:50.058 --> 11:51.700
But they carried on working together?

11:51.728 --> 11:53.329
Well, they needed each other.

11:53.449 --> 11:56.096
They shook hands in the end,
but it was never the same.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.313
And now...

11:59.435 --> 12:01.508
all of Alexander's methods,

12:01.767 --> 12:03.136
his clients...

12:03.789 --> 12:05.323
Ezra's alone.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.103
Thank you.

12:10.137 --> 12:12.192
Thank you, Miss Kohl. You've, uh...

12:13.658 --> 12:16.107
You've been very helpful.

12:23.515 --> 12:26.982
Le Cheyne has damage to the
esophagus, hemorrhage in the stomach.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.162
He's pink there and there.

12:29.246 --> 12:31.637
Oxyhaemoglobin...

12:33.442 --> 12:34.917
Poison then?

12:36.225 --> 12:37.788
But which?

12:41.203 --> 12:42.862
His insides, sir.

12:44.169 --> 12:45.381
There's a whiff.

12:46.180 --> 12:47.630
You don't say.

12:48.084 --> 12:50.323
Like... almonds.

12:51.999 --> 12:53.614
Bitter almonds.

12:58.117 --> 13:01.655
Get me paper, sodium
bicarbonate and picric acid.

13:04.639 --> 13:07.369
The inspector requires you, boy.

13:22.178 --> 13:24.346
Good day, ma'am. Sir.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.988
Good day.

13:27.867 --> 13:29.815
It isn't right...

13:30.088 --> 13:32.879
All these people, all with
love for their lost ones...

13:32.914 --> 13:35.811
And swings like Marvell
ringing 'em dry for it.

13:37.804 --> 13:39.761
Forgive me, sir, just...

13:40.367 --> 13:41.754
It isn't right.

13:47.276 --> 13:48.364
Come in.

13:48.724 --> 13:50.225
Calm your thoughts.

13:51.621 --> 13:53.394
What is the meaning of this?

13:53.514 --> 13:54.896
You tell us, Mr. Marvell.

13:54.913 --> 13:56.107
You're the psychic.

13:56.227 --> 13:57.332
This is a place of solace,

13:57.353 --> 14:00.815
where spirits may find welcome. You, sir,

14:00.857 --> 14:02.030
may find none.

14:02.150 --> 14:03.772
Some might think it cold,

14:04.172 --> 14:05.442
straight to work,

14:05.562 --> 14:07.002
not a moment in grief.

14:08.076 --> 14:11.174
You dare lecture me on
the manner of my sorrow?

14:12.206 --> 14:15.078
If you knew the slightest of my work,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.824
you would know that the dead are not dead.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.703
And what work you must have, sir.

14:21.090 --> 14:22.640
That train laying to waste,

14:22.642 --> 14:24.749
Mr. Le Cheyne now departed,

14:24.798 --> 14:27.080
and you free to take over his business.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.798
- For writing on the slate.
- Leave that, boy!

14:30.030 --> 14:31.687
You go right ahead, Constable.

14:33.890 --> 14:35.957
"Oil of phosphorus,

14:36.492 --> 14:37.889
ectoplasm."

14:41.759 --> 14:43.376
Soapy water and egg white.

14:44.069 --> 14:45.003
Get out.

14:45.782 --> 14:48.288
There are people beyond, good people,

14:48.408 --> 14:49.883
in need of comfort.

14:50.003 --> 14:51.534
Yes, Mr. Marvell,

14:51.920 --> 14:53.135
there are.

15:00.044 --> 15:01.088
Ezra Marvell,

15:01.130 --> 15:02.935
you are under arrest on suspicion of fraud.

15:06.852 --> 15:08.769
When you're right, you're right.

15:19.942 --> 15:22.847
They're both in the archive,
Le Cheyne and Marvell.

15:22.849 --> 15:25.771
Mr. Reid had them both
there for spiritualists.

15:26.770 --> 15:28.590
Alexander Le Cheyne.

15:29.106 --> 15:30.555
Born Donald Gribbon.

15:30.557 --> 15:32.484
And died of prussic acid.

15:33.810 --> 15:36.886
Hydrogen cyanide in his hip flask.

15:40.166 --> 15:43.046
- Grace, fetch Mr. Marvell!
- Oh, you're welcome!

15:47.524 --> 15:48.889
This is absurd!

15:49.226 --> 15:53.019
I could never kill Alex. He was my... my...

15:53.193 --> 15:54.266
Your friend,

15:54.755 --> 15:55.626
Mr. Marvell?

15:56.233 --> 15:57.901
Whose success you envied?

15:59.042 --> 16:00.660
Who stole your girl?

16:01.109 --> 16:03.278
Whom you told you'd destroy?

16:04.024 --> 16:05.211
Juniper.

16:05.946 --> 16:06.783
Ah.

16:07.935 --> 16:09.205
You said you didn't know her.

16:09.238 --> 16:12.047
I said Alex and I kept our lives separate,

16:12.221 --> 16:13.362
and she's why.

16:15.002 --> 16:17.733
Juniper Kohl plays a man

16:17.735 --> 16:19.630
like a marionette.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.996
I am guilty...

16:24.928 --> 16:27.569
of being that harlot's fool.

16:28.283 --> 16:29.850
What is Barnum's parlance...

16:29.970 --> 16:31.796
a sucker, sir? I may be a sucker,

16:31.799 --> 16:33.049
but I am no murderer.

16:33.277 --> 16:34.619
She said you were bitter.

16:34.642 --> 16:36.664
Not as bitter as Alexander was.

16:37.687 --> 16:40.648
Juniper slid her pretty
fingers deep into him

16:40.670 --> 16:42.350
and tore out his heart.

16:43.511 --> 16:45.193
I doubt she mentioned that.

16:46.216 --> 16:48.881
Nor how they fought like street cats.

16:49.368 --> 16:50.233
Fought?

16:50.834 --> 16:51.916
Why?

16:52.913 --> 16:55.036
Juniper intends to go to Paris,

16:55.059 --> 16:56.795
launch herself upon the music halls.

16:56.806 --> 16:58.475
Alexander could not bear it.

16:59.110 --> 17:00.773
To lose her for good?

17:01.391 --> 17:03.262
He swore he'd never allow it,

17:04.009 --> 17:05.917
that he knew how to stop it.

17:07.367 --> 17:08.616
You're very well informed

17:08.627 --> 17:11.093
for two men who kept their lives separate.

17:11.665 --> 17:13.334
Well, he became vocal in his rage,

17:13.362 --> 17:15.132
and he was not overly blessed with friends.

17:15.252 --> 17:17.306
And what was it he knew that would

17:17.425 --> 17:19.109
keep Juniper in London?

17:20.037 --> 17:22.817
There were limits to his confidence.

17:25.143 --> 17:27.884
But if you seek someone
with blood hot enough

17:27.940 --> 17:30.373
and a heart cold enough to murder a man,

17:30.424 --> 17:34.430
you ought to peer past
Juniper Kohl's pretty mask.

17:36.019 --> 17:38.749
Why should I believe you, Mr. Marvell?

17:40.339 --> 17:41.861
That's not even your name, is it?

17:42.131 --> 17:43.389
Tom Wallace?

17:48.643 --> 17:50.429
You ruined me today.

17:50.497 --> 17:52.761
I did no more than expose your fraud.

17:55.558 --> 17:57.503
Alex and I only offered the illusion

17:57.526 --> 17:59.368
that all of us crave most.

18:01.307 --> 18:04.863
This world is not so cruel as
it would appear to our love,

18:05.701 --> 18:07.706
to our permanence, and not so

18:07.768 --> 18:09.751
coldly bare of magic.

18:13.381 --> 18:15.965
Would you not sooner
believe that what is lost

18:16.302 --> 18:17.622
might return?

18:24.640 --> 18:26.488
So many looking glasses.

18:27.735 --> 18:29.432
That one was a gift.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.023
Who from?

18:32.707 --> 18:33.826
Someone I loved

18:34.736 --> 18:35.714
long ago.

18:37.309 --> 18:39.455
And turn again, please.

18:43.775 --> 18:45.034
Alice?

18:45.343 --> 18:46.485
Look.

18:46.983 --> 18:48.629
Come here.

18:50.007 --> 18:51.618
And look.

18:55.208 --> 18:56.933
There's so many of us.

18:59.955 --> 19:01.893
I like looking at us.

19:03.688 --> 19:05.624
I like it, too.

19:08.952 --> 19:11.396
You're so pretty, Miss Susan.

19:12.930 --> 19:15.558
When my wings grow, and I fly away.

19:16.805 --> 19:19.227
I shall always come back to visit you.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.799
We can look at ourselves like this.

19:23.878 --> 19:27.002
I hope you won't fly
away just yet, little one.

19:34.789 --> 19:36.514
Oh, Chief... Chief Inspector.

19:36.784 --> 19:37.857
Sergeant.

19:38.429 --> 19:40.345
Your inspector is required.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.761
Well, he is currently indisposed, sir.

19:43.457 --> 19:46.879
I said he is required.

19:52.312 --> 19:54.413
There are matters needful,

19:54.490 --> 19:56.007
Inspector Drake.

19:56.879 --> 19:58.143
Buckley attacked.

19:58.722 --> 20:00.395
He was uncontrollable.

20:00.902 --> 20:02.580
Used a knife as a weapon.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.008
Mr. Reid defended himself,

20:05.250 --> 20:06.301
as any of us would.

20:06.421 --> 20:07.651
In my day,

20:07.771 --> 20:11.667
Edmund Reid was no such
bedfellow with ways of violence.

20:11.787 --> 20:13.403
Begging your pardon, sir, but

20:13.577 --> 20:16.306
it has not been your day for some years.

20:22.645 --> 20:26.544
Buckley's autopsy report by your American.

20:27.510 --> 20:30.510
"Fracture of the cervical spine."

20:30.926 --> 20:33.150
Snapped his neck in the affray.

20:33.348 --> 20:35.320
Instantaneous death.

20:36.382 --> 20:37.533
Nothing to be done.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.028
Nothing to be done.

20:42.045 --> 20:44.635
Although there are some
folks in this quarter,

20:44.657 --> 20:46.955
claim to have seen Inspector Reid

20:47.326 --> 20:49.697
attack Mr. Buckley unprovoked

20:49.817 --> 20:51.088
in his own shop

20:51.966 --> 20:54.809
Saw him come out, bloody like a butcher...

20:55.030 --> 20:57.460
fists like raw leather...

20:57.786 --> 20:59.280
before he fled

20:59.634 --> 21:01.713
to parts unknown.

21:02.651 --> 21:03.775
I was there. I...

21:03.797 --> 21:05.241
I told you what I saw.

21:09.399 --> 21:11.539
I ask you this now

21:12.545 --> 21:14.056
with my notebook...

21:14.686 --> 21:16.360
closed.

21:18.330 --> 21:20.601
Give me the truth of it.

21:22.478 --> 21:24.422
I have already done so.

21:30.450 --> 21:32.018
Switzerland.

21:32.052 --> 21:33.962
I'm assured the school is excellent.

21:34.821 --> 21:37.400
She'll receive the very
finest education and treatment

21:37.407 --> 21:39.702
from doctors of the mind,
leaders in their field.

21:39.726 --> 21:41.576
We shall channel funds into a trust.

21:41.578 --> 21:42.710
Untraceable, of course.

21:42.712 --> 21:44.379
The girl shall have every opportunity.

21:46.674 --> 21:49.556
You must understand she cannot remain here.

21:51.635 --> 21:52.708
She's not ready.

21:52.876 --> 21:53.848
Miss Hart,

21:55.017 --> 21:56.944
you broke Edmund Reid,

21:56.967 --> 21:58.658
but you did not kill him.

22:00.642 --> 22:03.670
He's not without friends in these parts.

22:04.597 --> 22:05.957
Wherever Reid is,

22:05.968 --> 22:08.870
should he ever discover
the fiction fed to him...

22:10.952 --> 22:12.626
We do right by the girl

22:14.165 --> 22:15.733
to the extent we may,

22:16.859 --> 22:20.452
but she must remain dead to her father

22:20.929 --> 22:23.532
and everyone in Whitechapel

22:23.652 --> 22:25.796
for the rest of his days.

22:25.964 --> 22:27.470
Captain Jackson's with her.

22:27.509 --> 22:29.756
She came in demanding to
see the spiritualist Marvell,

22:29.773 --> 22:32.113
raving about Mr. Wakefield, his ghost, sir.

22:32.233 --> 22:33.646
In his shop.

22:36.436 --> 22:39.503
Refused my laudanum. More full-tour.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.388
I do not wish to be tranquilized.

22:43.344 --> 22:45.701
I wish for my dear husband to find peace.

22:45.718 --> 22:49.363
- Mrs. Wakefield...
- Mr. Le Cheyne warned me, Inspector.

22:49.915 --> 22:53.402
If I did not continue to comfort William,

22:53.404 --> 22:56.904
his pain would worsen, his
spirit would grow angry.

22:57.024 --> 22:58.702
Tell me what you saw.

23:00.914 --> 23:04.089
Mr. Le Cheyne always required
something of William's to...

23:04.152 --> 23:06.315
to sense his spirit.

23:07.305 --> 23:09.489
I would take William's tools.

23:11.989 --> 23:14.104
I took them from his studio yesterday.

23:14.918 --> 23:17.924
Went to place them back today, and...

23:18.661 --> 23:20.627
he had been there.

23:20.676 --> 23:21.596
I know it.

23:21.716 --> 23:22.938
Pardon me, ma'am.

23:23.606 --> 23:25.087
Those are some knives you've got there.

23:25.094 --> 23:27.271
What line of work was Mr. Wakefield in?

23:28.964 --> 23:30.347
A preserver, sir.

23:31.197 --> 23:32.489
A preserver?

23:34.540 --> 23:35.719
Taxidermy.

23:35.769 --> 23:37.461
Yes. Hmm.

23:41.134 --> 23:42.590
William has been in my dreams

23:42.644 --> 23:44.510
night after night

23:44.512 --> 23:47.476
since the locomotive
catastrophe took him from me.

23:50.103 --> 23:51.719
He is in unrest.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.976
The force of his spirit
took Mr. Le Cheyne today.

23:55.011 --> 23:58.326
Mr. Le Cheyne was poisoned, Mrs. Wakefield,

23:58.558 --> 24:01.613
and Mr. Marvell is in
my cells for defrauding.

24:01.634 --> 24:04.021
- I have had a visitation.
- Drake.

24:12.901 --> 24:15.458
Le Cheyne is killed
with prussic acid, right?

24:15.682 --> 24:17.478
William's an animal stuffer.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.480
Guess what they use to kill bugs.

24:19.868 --> 24:22.282
Prussic goddamn acid.

24:22.402 --> 24:23.386
Now,

24:24.018 --> 24:26.468
could be nothing, but could be

24:26.791 --> 24:30.015
Mrs. Wakefield here has a moment of clarity

24:30.050 --> 24:33.891
and sees through Le Cheyne, twigs that
he took some money for some hocus-pocus,

24:33.919 --> 24:35.787
decides to settle the score.

24:37.508 --> 24:39.818
Then why come here with the ghost story?

24:41.700 --> 24:44.067
Putting us on to throw us off. Who knows?

24:44.587 --> 24:47.837
Everything about this case,
up is down, black is white,

24:47.852 --> 24:49.775
in is out, everyone playing a goddamn part.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.299
I mean, who knows, Benneto?

24:57.438 --> 24:59.860
Mrs. Wakefield, would you show us where the

25:00.310 --> 25:02.540
visitation took place?

25:28.901 --> 25:30.474
Drake, look at this.

25:33.528 --> 25:36.985
No, it's not about what's
here. It's about what's missing.

25:37.854 --> 25:39.487
And here it is.

25:39.607 --> 25:42.664
Couple weeks back, he
restocked his supplies.

25:42.784 --> 25:44.498
Prussic acid.

25:45.114 --> 25:46.711
Guess what's not here.

25:46.831 --> 25:48.030
Ezra Marvell would have known

25:48.045 --> 25:49.643
he was an animal preserver,

25:50.003 --> 25:52.821
a dead one with a poison cabinet.

25:54.955 --> 25:56.509
Mrs. Wakefield?

25:58.440 --> 26:00.011
What else was moved?

26:00.266 --> 26:01.898
This chest.

26:02.249 --> 26:05.786
Those things were atop it to conceal it.

26:07.647 --> 26:09.438
Anything valuable in there?

26:09.455 --> 26:10.500
No.

26:10.620 --> 26:12.150
Business matters.

26:13.274 --> 26:15.109
Old ledgers.

26:15.416 --> 26:17.497
A little spare money.

26:22.378 --> 26:25.085
- There's none in there now.
- Yes...

26:25.994 --> 26:29.076
But there is... a few pounds at least.

26:30.550 --> 26:32.876
I... I took some to pay Mr. Le Cheyne,

26:32.912 --> 26:34.026
but there... there's...

26:35.641 --> 26:37.353
Then someone else has took it.

26:38.222 --> 26:41.597
Ghosts haven't any use
for coin, Mrs. Wakefield.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.490
This place hasn't been haunted.

26:44.508 --> 26:45.890
It's been burgled.

26:49.588 --> 26:52.002
- But the door.
- The lock could have been picked.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.535
Then, um...

27:03.458 --> 27:05.319
Then it... it was not him.

27:19.575 --> 27:21.086
I miss him.

27:23.983 --> 27:26.046
I miss him so terribly.

27:30.305 --> 27:32.130
Where you stand, sir...

27:33.860 --> 27:37.389
William stood in... in that very
place the last time I saw him.

27:38.556 --> 27:40.646
His beautiful face.

27:41.611 --> 27:43.885
When they found him, the...

27:44.411 --> 27:46.763
The accident had destroyed him.

27:47.395 --> 27:50.169
Beyond all...

27:52.522 --> 27:54.453
these...

27:59.149 --> 28:01.177
He had such a gift.

28:02.643 --> 28:04.188
He used to call it a...

28:04.308 --> 28:05.795
a blessing.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.735
A power

28:08.999 --> 28:11.808
to snatch back from
death something of life,

28:11.843 --> 28:13.616
something of beauty

28:14.055 --> 28:15.661
that could not die.

28:16.855 --> 28:18.584
Diamonds from ashes,

28:19.313 --> 28:20.832
he said.

28:33.446 --> 28:36.650
Did Mr. Wakefield enjoy the music halls?

28:37.141 --> 28:39.862
Blewett's Pavilion and
Varieties, for instance?

28:39.982 --> 28:41.846
Did he spend any time there?

28:41.873 --> 28:45.964
William sometimes liked to
take in a song after work.

28:46.499 --> 28:49.202
He promised to take me to
the music halls in Paris.

28:49.322 --> 28:52.608
- In Paris?
- Hmm? Um, the...

28:52.626 --> 28:54.434
The... the Olympia.

28:55.637 --> 28:57.436
The Moulin Rouge.

28:58.402 --> 29:00.552
He would read to me about them.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.678
All right, so maybe it's the widow.

29:04.695 --> 29:06.662
Maybe Marvell comes back for the poison,

29:06.688 --> 29:09.158
decides to help himself to
a little scratch on the side.

29:09.179 --> 29:10.479
What I'd like to know

29:10.528 --> 29:12.403
is what you took from there.

29:21.582 --> 29:23.317
I'll be damned.

29:23.437 --> 29:25.979
So much for Mrs.
Wakefield's saintly husband.

29:26.906 --> 29:31.153
Look away, son. Be not
corrupted by this devilish filth.

29:33.245 --> 29:35.914
That little minx sure
gets around, don't she?

29:37.740 --> 29:40.161
- It's her, isn't it?
- Oh, that's her, all right.

29:41.223 --> 29:43.673
Blewett's own Juniper Kohl.

30:21.671 --> 30:23.164
One night, a fellow comes here,

30:23.181 --> 30:24.597
asked to use his camera.

30:25.288 --> 30:27.079
Had no money for a bed,

30:27.088 --> 30:29.256
not a ha'penny, and he offered a crown.

30:29.765 --> 30:31.217
A crown.

30:31.337 --> 30:34.242
But it wasn't no William Wakefield.

30:34.362 --> 30:35.717
It weren't that is he...

30:36.279 --> 30:38.298
He must have bought these... or...

30:39.329 --> 30:42.130
So you never knew a Wakefield, then?

30:47.428 --> 30:48.871
No, sir.

30:51.312 --> 30:53.616
He was a lover of Paris also.

30:54.170 --> 30:55.007
Sir?

30:55.127 --> 30:56.262
Paris.

30:57.219 --> 30:59.222
You plan to live there, don't you?

30:59.224 --> 31:01.040
Work the music halls.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.741
Is that illegal?

31:03.861 --> 31:04.961
No.

31:05.785 --> 31:08.681
But Mr. Le Cheyne wasn't
happy about it, was he?

31:09.087 --> 31:10.922
He was all set to stop you.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.432
Said he knew how.

31:14.139 --> 31:16.584
What was it he knew, Miss?

31:17.602 --> 31:19.691
Was it worth killing for?

31:21.622 --> 31:24.791
I heard you arrested Ezra
for killing poor Alexander.

31:28.170 --> 31:30.751
We arrested Ezra Marvell for fraud.

31:31.330 --> 31:34.140
Then you should know better than
to believe a word he tells you.

31:34.260 --> 31:37.370
Miss Kohl, you will drop your mask with me

31:37.413 --> 31:40.784
or you shall end up
pirouetting in leg irons.

31:45.964 --> 31:48.009
William took the photographs.

31:51.889 --> 31:53.249
An affair?

31:54.987 --> 31:56.729
Does his...

31:56.954 --> 31:59.219
his wife know about...

32:00.544 --> 32:03.002
His wife is grieving.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.197
I'm sorry.

32:07.317 --> 32:09.884
I'm so sorry for her.

32:10.004 --> 32:11.385
William was...

32:12.262 --> 32:13.711
It was...

32:13.728 --> 32:15.493
wrong,

32:15.524 --> 32:17.350
some would say.

32:18.070 --> 32:21.450
But what is life without passion, sir?

32:23.820 --> 32:26.664
I... I do wish to travel. I always have.

32:26.866 --> 32:29.956
Alexander did not like it, but...

32:30.707 --> 32:32.677
to think that I might...

32:33.977 --> 32:35.710
That I could kill him?

32:38.147 --> 32:40.428
Is it so hard to understand that

32:40.568 --> 32:44.474
someone might want to leave this
place behind and start again?

32:46.642 --> 32:48.591
May I take these, sir,

32:49.223 --> 32:50.490
and destroy them?

32:51.075 --> 32:53.612
No, Miss Kohl, you may not.

33:01.117 --> 33:02.337
Inspector.

33:04.145 --> 33:06.830
- Mr. Morton.
- Would you join us later,

33:06.950 --> 33:09.188
when Rose takes the stage?

33:09.223 --> 33:10.829
You'd be most welcome.

33:10.831 --> 33:12.579
That's very kind of you, sir,

33:13.165 --> 33:16.738
but sadly, I have other plans.

33:16.858 --> 33:18.889
Very well. Another time.

33:19.213 --> 33:20.755
Thank you, sir.

33:23.359 --> 33:26.743
Mountains, cool streams,

33:26.863 --> 33:29.698
green fields filled with flowers.

33:29.818 --> 33:31.987
Jasmines, forget-me-nots.

33:32.715 --> 33:35.524
Doesn't that sound a good
place for a little fairy?

33:36.771 --> 33:38.439
No, thank you.

33:38.441 --> 33:39.791
I like it here.

33:39.793 --> 33:42.529
Here, Alice. Drink it up, girl.

33:53.819 --> 33:55.373
Sleep now.

33:55.821 --> 33:57.291
Miss Susan?

33:57.293 --> 33:58.374
Hmm?

33:58.585 --> 34:01.947
You're the queen of here, are you not?

34:03.457 --> 34:05.183
Yes, I am.

34:05.748 --> 34:08.435
I thought every queen had a king.

34:12.174 --> 34:13.684
Where is your king?

34:38.574 --> 34:40.270
The child makes progress.

34:41.206 --> 34:42.471
Day by day.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.420
In time, perhaps

34:45.112 --> 34:46.913
her fractures of the mind may

34:47.033 --> 34:48.230
heal.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.485
Or they may be split afresh if she is

34:50.521 --> 34:53.146
torn from the safety of this place, um.

34:53.266 --> 34:55.980
Swiss *** patch and robbed
of my care and treatment.

34:56.016 --> 34:57.508
That is enough, Doctor Frayn.

34:58.562 --> 35:00.221
You have duties at the clinic.

35:00.590 --> 35:01.915
Attend to them.

35:10.973 --> 35:12.772
Front page, Mr. Best.

35:21.999 --> 35:24.141
Here's a telegram for you.

35:32.510 --> 35:34.350
_

35:34.610 --> 35:38.292
_

35:46.412 --> 35:47.975
You did right, Ben.

35:48.589 --> 35:51.510
By Mister Reid, and by the division.

35:51.770 --> 35:53.593
You did the honorable thing.

35:54.032 --> 35:56.385
There is no honor in a lie, Donald.

35:57.105 --> 36:00.335
Well, we both know the
world ain't that simple.

36:04.267 --> 36:07.076
The job though, will you take it?

36:10.517 --> 36:13.590
There is a darkness in
this place, my friend.

36:14.669 --> 36:17.004
An abyss, Mister Reid called it.

36:18.286 --> 36:21.990
An it can take from a man,
all he holds in his heart.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.712
As long as he walks these streets,

36:25.738 --> 36:29.065
it will shortly find him, and swallow him.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.096
I don't pretend to know
too much about that.

36:33.745 --> 36:36.501
Except, we do our best
to walk through the fire,

36:36.510 --> 36:38.910
holding on to whatever scraps of it we can.

36:38.924 --> 36:40.917
you,

36:41.171 --> 36:43.550
Bennet Drake, know more than most.

36:44.894 --> 36:48.423
And you of all men, may yet
make out of this life, a life.

36:48.543 --> 36:50.741
Come on. One more.

36:56.413 --> 36:58.519
You were impressive today, sir.

36:58.555 --> 37:00.793
With poor Mr. Le Cheyne.

37:01.382 --> 37:04.726
And Rose tells me you work for
the police, some years past.

37:04.770 --> 37:07.395
Uh, "with", not "for".

37:08.247 --> 37:09.956
Now that Reid's gone to God knows where,

37:09.957 --> 37:12.155
I guess that arrangement's
gone the way of all flesh.

37:12.370 --> 37:13.760
So, uh...

37:14.480 --> 37:16.780
you'll be concentrating
on your doctor's practice?

37:17.201 --> 37:19.308
- Uh...
- Because

37:19.428 --> 37:21.669
were you interested in expansion,

37:22.021 --> 37:23.969
my father could be a, er,

37:24.602 --> 37:26.270
sympathetic investor.

37:26.390 --> 37:29.166
Alongside Blewitt', he's ploughing
funds into half of Whitehapel.

37:29.202 --> 37:31.809
- You shittin' me?
- No, I'm not.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.197
Uh, shitting you.

37:36.330 --> 37:38.007
The man doesn't even know me.

37:38.127 --> 37:40.000
But he'd be delighted to.

37:41.878 --> 37:43.502
He's been well-briefed.

37:46.855 --> 37:48.945
I'm  trying to persuade
her to sing at the wedding.

37:48.971 --> 37:52.726
- She doesn't want to?
- Well, I imagined her on a gazebo,

37:52.729 --> 37:54.651
flamingoes all around.

37:55.029 --> 37:58.286
But Rose feels it's a little de trop.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.050
How austere of her.

You left so soon, I...

41:22.283 --> 41:24.030
I brought some supper.

41:24.376 --> 41:26.125
Oh.

41:26.543 --> 41:29.299
The supper and I are both getting cold.

41:29.334 --> 41:30.695
Yes, forgive me, Rose.

41:30.815 --> 41:32.319
Come in.

41:34.635 --> 41:38.095
Here, I'll... get you some room.

41:38.745 --> 41:40.720
No plates?

41:40.840 --> 41:42.166
Rose, it's late.

41:42.168 --> 41:44.418
I don't think Mr. Morton would

41:44.420 --> 41:46.663
care for you calling
on a fellow with a chop.

41:47.049 --> 41:49.840
Mr. Morton's not my keeper.

41:49.842 --> 41:51.322
He is your intended, Rose.

41:51.327 --> 41:54.244
It ain't champagne and
lark tongues, Bennet. Just

41:54.246 --> 41:56.064
eat the bloody food.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.547
I don't know if I should...

42:15.130 --> 42:17.251
congratulate you.

42:17.930 --> 42:19.546
The promotion.

42:22.030 --> 42:24.286
I've not yet accepted.

42:24.638 --> 42:26.455
I know he was...

42:27.010 --> 42:30.213
is your friend, Bennet,

42:31.178 --> 42:33.592
but if the inspector is gone,

42:33.890 --> 42:36.296
what better man to keep Whitechapel safe?

42:36.416 --> 42:38.078
So people keep asking.

42:38.090 --> 42:40.263
And what does that tell you?

42:43.274 --> 42:46.224
Four years I coppered Manchester, Rose.

42:47.260 --> 42:48.779
I started again.

42:48.990 --> 42:50.851
Constable Drake.

42:51.412 --> 42:53.299
I tried to police,

42:53.641 --> 42:55.634
to live, as a good man,

42:56.020 --> 42:58.285
to make myself new,

42:59.092 --> 43:01.410
and I started to know promise again,

43:01.709 --> 43:03.438
to know hope.

43:04.457 --> 43:06.897
It was hope I thought I'd
bring back with me here.

43:10.048 --> 43:12.436
See what I brought instead?

43:13.296 --> 43:14.990
Everything falls apart.

43:15.110 --> 43:18.882
- You cannot blame yourself.
- No, Rose, I...

43:19.002 --> 43:21.138
I should have stayed away.

43:22.227 --> 43:24.308
I did not make myself new.

43:24.826 --> 43:27.810
I brought a curse to a cursed place.

43:28.249 --> 43:29.496
And I...

43:29.847 --> 43:31.972
the very train what brought me here was...

43:40.478 --> 43:43.112
I have nothing to give Whitechapel, Rose,

43:43.454 --> 43:45.973
and Whitechapel has nothing for no man.

43:46.754 --> 43:49.984
It is a place where good and
precious things are broken

43:50.104 --> 43:52.278
and hope is made a phantom.

43:52.398 --> 43:53.978
You're wrong.

43:58.939 --> 44:01.686
There is something good and precious here

44:02.362 --> 44:04.162
which is not broken,

44:05.839 --> 44:07.629
which cannot be.

44:08.779 --> 44:10.183
No, Rose.

44:10.886 --> 44:12.475
No, girl, listen.

44:13.607 --> 44:15.503
You are to be married.

44:16.451 --> 44:17.882
And I...

44:20.595 --> 44:22.640
the villainy I wade through,

44:23.456 --> 44:24.913
my daily toil,

44:25.361 --> 44:26.836
it is lies

44:26.890 --> 44:29.013
and treachery and ruined hearts,

44:29.021 --> 44:31.790
and I would see you
protected from that, Rose.

44:32.454 --> 44:35.701
I would see you kept safe from
the sad havoc of this world.

44:35.710 --> 44:39.870
- I will not bring my ruin upon you.
- You do not bring ruin!

44:40.757 --> 44:42.943
You bring hope.

44:44.049 --> 44:48.157
You are naught but hope and life.

44:49.939 --> 44:52.230
You saved me,

44:53.354 --> 44:56.119
first time I ever laid eyes on you.

44:57.155 --> 44:59.350
That's who you are to me,

45:01.361 --> 45:03.643
who you'll always be.

46:10.048 --> 46:11.523
Mortuary records, sir.

46:13.778 --> 46:16.080
What Mrs. Wakefield said about her husband,

46:16.761 --> 46:18.538
she was not exaggerating.

46:18.872 --> 46:21.233
The record says the whole
of him was burnt meat.

46:22.098 --> 46:24.471
She only knew him by his pocket watch.

46:28.334 --> 46:30.905
There was this fellow
up in Manchester once.

46:31.025 --> 46:32.881
Made like he'd fallen off a boat,

46:32.898 --> 46:34.469
washed away in the canals,

46:34.724 --> 46:36.419
and his missus leaves town,

46:36.539 --> 46:38.579
we find them both living
it up in Altrincham

46:38.596 --> 46:39.914
on his life insurance.

46:39.956 --> 46:42.660
So you're thinking, sir, that Wakefield,

46:43.450 --> 46:44.758
he faked it,

46:45.144 --> 46:47.605
planted his watch on some poor bugger

46:47.725 --> 46:50.964
to be with the dancer,
sir, to be with miss Kohl?

46:51.579 --> 46:53.462
Well, why kill Le Cheyne?

46:54.467 --> 46:57.864
Ezra Marvell said Le
Cheyne wanted Juniper back,

46:58.198 --> 47:00.838
said he knew something that
would wreck her plans of leaving.

47:00.880 --> 47:03.373
If Wakefield lives, if this is fraud,

47:03.668 --> 47:05.395
maybe Le Cheyne found out.

47:05.704 --> 47:07.277
I'll see about brokers,

47:07.397 --> 47:09.433
see if Wakefield took a policy.

47:23.964 --> 47:26.104
Calm yourself, darling.

47:26.134 --> 47:26.950
Juney.

47:26.977 --> 47:28.064
Where have you been all night?

47:28.108 --> 47:29.951
- Wherever I please.
- I was right sick.

47:29.979 --> 47:32.349
Maybe you should worry
about leaving your photograph

47:32.349 --> 47:35.416
- for the bloody police to grope at.
- The police?

47:35.536 --> 47:38.070
- You said you destroyed them, William.
- I...

47:38.253 --> 47:40.368
- There was no time.
- You went back for the poison.

47:40.410 --> 47:41.653
I wasn't thinking.

47:42.138 --> 47:44.701
I... I'm not a professional at this, Juney.

47:44.729 --> 47:46.660
Oh, I thought that's exactly what you were.

47:46.689 --> 47:49.540
You tell all the girls you
conjure diamonds out of ashes.

47:49.561 --> 47:50.993
We should have done this as we planned.

47:51.113 --> 47:53.051
Cover ourselves, left no trail.

47:53.065 --> 47:55.179
I was a bloody fool to
think the train would...

47:55.299 --> 47:58.270
- That we'd be able to...
- It was to perfect to chance.

47:58.622 --> 47:59.468
The police?

47:59.588 --> 48:01.369
- What did they...
- Nothing.

48:01.489 --> 48:04.309
A copper sniffed about,
so I gave him a show.

48:04.429 --> 48:06.290
I got rid of the poison yesterday,

48:06.304 --> 48:08.263
and they got Ezra banged up for it.

48:09.640 --> 48:10.805
Do the police...

48:11.760 --> 48:13.270
Does Olivia know about...

48:13.790 --> 48:15.201
the pictures?

48:16.851 --> 48:17.834
No.

48:19.436 --> 48:20.687
Jesus, though.

48:20.870 --> 48:22.759
What have we done,
Juney? What have we done?

48:22.879 --> 48:24.372
And one more day in this room,

48:24.386 --> 48:25.839
I'll lose my bloody mind.

48:25.890 --> 48:27.504
You're nearly there.

48:27.624 --> 48:29.182
Alexander is gone.

48:29.393 --> 48:31.367
The insurance pays out today.

48:32.161 --> 48:35.777
Paris, my love, our lives

48:35.777 --> 48:37.145
in lights.

48:37.180 --> 48:41.148
We just need to hold on.

48:45.190 --> 48:48.690
Captain Homer fucking Jackson.

48:48.699 --> 48:51.008
Jesus! God!

48:59.857 --> 49:02.438
I swear to God, darling,
whosoever has the strength to

49:02.456 --> 49:05.739
pull me out of you, should be
named the true king of all England.

49:06.257 --> 49:07.924
Vulgarian!

49:08.583 --> 49:10.207
And then some.

49:39.015 --> 49:40.823
You know what Edgar was saying last night,

49:40.858 --> 49:42.394
about my father...

49:42.514 --> 49:44.080
He would like to meet you.

49:45.410 --> 49:46.784
Christ, what's next?

49:47.029 --> 49:48.557
Song of Solomon?

49:54.789 --> 49:56.694
Look, Mimi, I didn't mean...

49:58.730 --> 50:00.609
I don't...

50:00.652 --> 50:02.452
Need a minute, goddammit!

50:02.478 --> 50:05.024
You don't... what, Doctor Jackson?

50:09.015 --> 50:11.982
Son of a bitch.

50:12.912 --> 50:16.310
You don't need a doctor by the
time I get there, you will in a...

50:17.153 --> 50:20.234
Captain Jackson, I believe
this was surgery hours.

50:20.734 --> 50:22.709
I hope the moment is not

50:23.973 --> 50:25.869
inopportune.

50:28.196 --> 50:30.987
Is there any word of Inspector Reid?

50:32.330 --> 50:35.060
Now you see, I thought
this was friendly visit.

50:35.780 --> 50:38.861
- You been petitioned again, Miss Hart?
- Hm.

50:42.934 --> 50:45.620
Wherever Reid is, he ain't sent a postcard.

50:46.533 --> 50:49.614
That man has every reason
to run and never turn back.

50:50.773 --> 50:53.283
Starting to think that
ain't such a bad idea myself.

50:53.301 --> 50:55.127
Haven't you had your fill of running?

50:55.373 --> 50:57.400
Okay, is this what we're going to do now?

50:57.883 --> 51:00.736
You're going to stop by, we're gonna take
our turn, you're gonna ask your questions,

51:00.753 --> 51:02.342
and then what, we all just go home?

51:02.851 --> 51:04.650
It isn't what we dreamt of, is it?

51:05.050 --> 51:06.660
Back in Chicago.

51:07.450 --> 51:10.277
Nothing's what you're dreaming,
that's why they call 'em dreams.

51:10.304 --> 51:13.359
What does Ms. Morton make
of your charming optimism?

51:15.050 --> 51:18.660
Give it a few days at most, then she'll be
spitting my name and pickin' new suitors.

51:18.687 --> 51:21.092
- She seems taken with you.
- That mean she likes me.

51:21.443 --> 51:23.690
Her brother likes me, her old man likes me,

51:23.734 --> 51:26.254
hasn't even met me. I mean, shit,
it's because he hasn't met me.

51:31.555 --> 51:33.460
Falling in love with her, aren't you?

51:34.716 --> 51:36.699
What?

51:37.937 --> 51:39.965
I've seen that look on you before.

51:43.152 --> 51:45.118
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come.

51:47.313 --> 51:48.858
Why did you come?

51:52.449 --> 51:55.302
Go back to her, Captain Jackson.

51:57.550 --> 52:00.692
- Goddammit Caitlin.
- I don't even know who that is.

52:02.176 --> 52:04.721
Go back to Ms. Morton, stop running.

52:04.730 --> 52:06.678
- Go home.
- Susan...

52:19.253 --> 52:21.851
Wakefield took life
insurance two months past.

52:23.235 --> 52:25.145
The beneficiary, sir.

52:25.395 --> 52:26.475
There she is.

52:26.492 --> 52:28.985
The solicitor said a man had
been nosing about Wakefield,

52:29.020 --> 52:30.767
said he promised to
bring evidence of fraud.

52:30.811 --> 52:33.085
- Give a name?
- Gribbon, Donald Gribbon.

52:33.102 --> 52:34.892
- Le Cheyne's real name.
- He knew.

52:34.919 --> 52:37.640
That's what he knew.
That's why they killed him.

52:37.810 --> 52:40.981
- When's the insurance pay out?
- Pays today. Miss Kohl to collect.

52:41.192 --> 52:44.335
I want her and Wakefield
for fraud and murder.

52:44.455 --> 52:47.608
- The snide we used to roust Obsidian's dues.
- The counterfeit.

52:47.657 --> 52:49.750
Get all of it, see the lawyer pays with it.

52:50.052 --> 52:51.499
You stay on Juniper Kohl.

52:51.541 --> 52:52.960
She'll lead us to Wakefield.

52:55.221 --> 52:56.695
Oh, Grace?

52:57.243 --> 53:00.235
Send a constable for
Mrs. Wakefield, will you?

53:12.650 --> 53:14.540
But I am his...

53:14.932 --> 53:16.372
his wife.

53:16.990 --> 53:18.374
Why would he...

53:18.816 --> 53:20.522
Why?

53:27.145 --> 53:29.652
He told me those days were over.

53:30.586 --> 53:32.447
The days of following his prick.

53:33.476 --> 53:35.618
And now even in death he betrays me.

53:37.373 --> 53:39.684
Where was she, this... this

53:39.866 --> 53:42.670
Juniper Kohl and the rest of his whores

53:42.790 --> 53:43.797
when I stood in the rain

53:43.819 --> 53:45.734
and watched dirt shovelled on him?

53:46.296 --> 53:47.797
When I had to look upon what

53:48.161 --> 53:49.860
remained of him.

53:52.755 --> 53:54.341
I made him this gift

53:55.015 --> 53:56.323
on our wedding day.

53:58.283 --> 53:59.469
At the end...

54:00.881 --> 54:02.440
it was all I knew him by.

54:03.330 --> 54:04.966
The inscription, sir.

54:08.450 --> 54:10.111
I thought to keep it with me,

54:11.354 --> 54:12.877
close to my heart.

54:17.461 --> 54:20.319
You must think me a stupid, stupid woman.

54:21.161 --> 54:22.873
I do no such thing.

54:25.574 --> 54:26.618
Inspector,

54:27.782 --> 54:29.867
may I ask of you once more benevolence?

54:31.144 --> 54:32.830
My husband is dead,

54:33.729 --> 54:35.612
but I would know his account.

54:37.886 --> 54:40.165
Will you permit me to
speak with Ezra Marvell?

54:55.159 --> 54:56.215
Mrs. Wakefield.

54:59.885 --> 55:00.898
Is it true?

55:02.107 --> 55:03.217
Mr. Marvell?

55:03.810 --> 55:05.028
What they say of you,

55:05.203 --> 55:06.129
that you're...

55:08.546 --> 55:10.852
- Have you, too, deceived me?
- No,

55:11.275 --> 55:12.510
madame, no.

55:13.899 --> 55:17.188
My gifts are as were Mr. Le Cheyne's...

55:18.041 --> 55:19.084
a blessing

55:19.925 --> 55:20.972
too special

55:21.713 --> 55:23.510
to be comprehended by all.

55:25.812 --> 55:26.783
You see, I...

55:29.768 --> 55:32.164
I need to ask my husband.

55:33.404 --> 55:35.971
You must help me communicate with him.

55:36.420 --> 55:38.776
I do not wish to guide him to peace.

55:40.870 --> 55:42.663
I wish to ask of him the truth.

55:44.331 --> 55:45.990
I must know who she is.

55:46.110 --> 55:46.820
She?

55:47.503 --> 55:48.357
Who, madame?

55:49.216 --> 55:50.820
His whore.

55:52.447 --> 55:53.548
Who is this...

55:54.438 --> 55:56.016
Juniper Kohl?

55:59.050 --> 55:59.966
Will you help me?

56:00.955 --> 56:02.177
Mrs. Wakefield, I...

56:05.081 --> 56:05.998
... I cannot.

56:12.146 --> 56:14.182
My powers are...

56:28.608 --> 56:30.469
What you've heard of me is the truth,

56:33.664 --> 56:37.086
perhaps the sole truth of Ezra Marvell.

56:41.468 --> 56:42.852
I am Tom Wallace.

56:44.138 --> 56:47.253
I'm no more than a fairground conjurer.

56:49.958 --> 56:51.954
All I may offer you

56:52.237 --> 56:53.940
is the opportunity to

56:54.060 --> 56:56.213
ask your questions directly

56:57.395 --> 56:59.230
to Juniper Kohl herself.

57:00.789 --> 57:01.772
You...

57:03.188 --> 57:04.419
You know her?

57:04.788 --> 57:05.606
Once.

57:08.990 --> 57:12.662
Enough to know where she was
most fond to take her men.

57:18.109 --> 57:19.345
Everything is arranged.

57:23.269 --> 57:24.739
Carriage to the docks,

57:25.140 --> 57:27.373
first class aboard the steamer...

57:28.969 --> 57:31.225
then our hands are clean.

57:31.517 --> 57:32.412
Clean?

57:32.890 --> 57:34.326
Is that what you believe?

57:35.337 --> 57:38.524
They're clean enough to
exchange those bearer bonds.

57:42.537 --> 57:44.564
What is that girl doing
out of her quarters?

57:45.692 --> 57:46.986
I want to stay here.

57:47.401 --> 57:48.700
I don't want to go on a ship.

57:48.749 --> 57:49.963
- I won't!
- Alice.

57:50.010 --> 57:53.113
She stays in her quarters.
Is that understood?

57:53.634 --> 57:55.355
I beg your pardon, sir.

57:56.130 --> 57:57.059
Miss Susan?

58:00.462 --> 58:01.390
Your visitor.

58:12.966 --> 58:14.881
Juney, tell me we did it!

58:20.040 --> 58:20.916
Olivia.

58:21.429 --> 58:22.349
Oh!

58:25.226 --> 58:26.466
My darling.

58:30.568 --> 58:31.567
You...

58:44.857 --> 58:45.842
This...

58:47.401 --> 58:48.916
Is not what it appears.

58:49.923 --> 58:51.105
Olivia...

58:52.184 --> 58:54.076
My darling, my...

58:58.566 --> 58:59.626
Olivia...

58:59.628 --> 59:00.718
Oh...

59:01.132 --> 59:03.346
My... my love.

59:11.167 --> 59:12.722
Bonjour!

59:14.717 --> 59:16.263
Look what I've got.

01:00:01.661 --> 01:00:03.450
I care for Edgar.

01:00:04.969 --> 01:00:06.609
He's a decent man, but

01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:08.645
Bennet, he...

01:00:10.308 --> 01:00:12.717
he owns a piece of me, Miss Susan.

01:00:15.356 --> 01:00:16.646
He always has.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:20.377
But I...

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.271
I can't help but wonder if I should...

01:00:29.537 --> 01:00:33.056
My father wanted me to
marry a man named Jared King.

01:00:33.676 --> 01:00:35.510
Heir to a mining fortune.

01:00:36.287 --> 01:00:37.726
Also a decent man.

01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:42.594
But I chose a penniless Pinkerton.

01:00:44.503 --> 01:00:45.924
Bennet is...

01:00:46.871 --> 01:00:47.950
He's not the captain.

01:00:48.372 --> 01:00:49.249
No.

01:00:49.937 --> 01:00:51.205
No, he's not.

01:00:52.998 --> 01:00:54.301
But do you...

01:00:56.198 --> 01:00:58.146
But before now, that is,

01:00:58.962 --> 01:01:00.716
did you regret it?

01:01:01.447 --> 01:01:02.899
My dear Rose,

01:01:04.378 --> 01:01:06.526
the regrets I have accrued in this life

01:01:06.548 --> 01:01:08.841
could fill all the oceans twice over,

01:01:10.017 --> 01:01:10.898
but that?

01:01:11.694 --> 01:01:12.538
Him?

01:01:14.368 --> 01:01:15.375
The captain...

01:01:18.598 --> 01:01:20.719
Not one single moment.

01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:30.328
That's gonna itch like
hell for a couple days,

01:01:30.331 --> 01:01:33.385
but that's mother
nature's way of telling you

01:01:33.505 --> 01:01:35.412
not to put it there.

01:01:40.058 --> 01:01:41.146
Next.

01:01:47.798 --> 01:01:50.476
I shall refrain from dropping my smalls.

01:01:55.191 --> 01:01:56.881
Look, if you're here for dirt on Reid...

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.706
I come on no such business.

01:02:00.827 --> 01:02:02.225
All right, Best,

01:02:03.025 --> 01:02:04.387
what is it that ails you?

01:02:04.639 --> 01:02:05.695
A sickness.

01:02:06.032 --> 01:02:07.147
Oh?

01:02:07.501 --> 01:02:09.489
- You vomiting, or...
- A sickness in the hearts

01:02:09.511 --> 01:02:11.250
of Whitechapel, Captain Jackson.

01:02:12.599 --> 01:02:15.270
You know, you should know
my scalpels are very sharp.

01:02:16.235 --> 01:02:18.208
The Leman Street locomotive tragedy.

01:02:18.236 --> 01:02:19.816
55 souls killed...

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:23.625
- And five men hanged for it.
- Five pawns hanged, five pawns,

01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:26.314
and you know what they took
or for whom they took it?

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:27.910
What of it?

01:02:28.618 --> 01:02:31.453
The seat cabin they cleaned
out. It carried bearer bonds,

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:34.205
- American dollars.
- Yeah, this is all known news, Best.

01:02:34.219 --> 01:02:36.003
Why don't you just give
me the goddamn headline,

01:02:36.045 --> 01:02:37.372
for Christ sakes, huh?

01:02:56.361 --> 01:02:57.688
Why are you bringing this to me?

01:02:57.934 --> 01:02:59.718
What, do you not see, Captain?

01:03:00.561 --> 01:03:03.520
The name of the addressee
is clearly marked.

01:03:04.401 --> 01:03:06.627
He whose anonymous securities were robbed,

01:03:06.641 --> 01:03:09.816
he who still the police
no wiser now continues

01:03:09.936 --> 01:03:12.330
to ship such spoils into London.

01:03:13.481 --> 01:03:17.243
Have you really forgot what the
name Theodore Patrick Swift means?

01:03:17.831 --> 01:03:19.910
Or does the thought of
your father-in-law's coin

01:03:19.938 --> 01:03:22.651
getting burgled in such close
proximity to his daughter,

01:03:22.679 --> 01:03:23.904
your wife,

01:03:24.207 --> 01:03:26.573
not raise one mote

01:03:26.693 --> 01:03:27.950
of suspicion in you?

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:30.853
His estranged daughter
and my estranged wife,

01:03:31.387 --> 01:03:33.113
in case you've forgotten.

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:36.838
What exactly are you implying?
You think, what, Susan

01:03:36.849 --> 01:03:38.406
was involved in this?

01:03:39.591 --> 01:03:40.821
It is a...

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:43.282
startling coincidence, is it not?

01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:46.277
It's conjecture, and you're
out of your goddamn mind.

01:03:46.316 --> 01:03:49.764
I'm not saying it is so. I'm
merely asking you the question.

01:03:50.203 --> 01:03:51.390
You...

01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:55.878
you once enjoyed such intimacy
with the lady's ways and doings.

01:03:57.745 --> 01:04:00.288
You need to get out of my surgery

01:04:00.828 --> 01:04:03.068
while you still have one ear.

01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:06.909
Not saying, Captain.

01:04:07.492 --> 01:04:09.079
Asking.

01:04:31.305 --> 01:04:32.969
Come! Alice!

01:04:45.161 --> 01:04:46.987
I need to see Bennet Drake!

01:04:47.485 --> 01:04:48.875
Rose!

01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:52.314
I've seen her.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.587
- What do you...
- The girl.

01:05:18.595 --> 01:05:20.746
Whoa, whoa!

01:05:27.137 --> 01:05:29.033
Step aside!

01:05:29.771 --> 01:05:31.843
Excuse me, step aside!

01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:33.853
Get out of the car!

01:05:48.021 --> 01:05:49.846
Alice!

01:06:01.434 --> 01:06:03.084
Alice.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.913
Alice!

01:06:09.668 --> 01:06:11.537
Alice!

01:06:13.468 --> 01:06:14.988
Alice!

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:21.809
Alice!

01:06:24.896 --> 01:06:27.032
Alice!

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:33.019
Alice!

01:06:57.274 --> 01:06:58.950
Mr. Reid, sir.
