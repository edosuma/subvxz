27:02.734 --> 27:06.300
I've got a men's line.
I've got cover-ups, athleisure.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.266
So you've put
one of everything out, Ash?

27:09.300 --> 27:13.033
- Mesh, mesh, biker, cropped,
complicated, classic.

27:13.066 --> 27:17.200
- I am so excited
for all my friends to see it.

27:17.233 --> 27:19.033
It's time to celebrate.

27:19.066 --> 27:20.133
Okay, perfect.

27:20.166 --> 27:22.567
London, we finally got there.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.300
I love a reveal.

27:27.734 --> 27:29.133
Here's my husband.

27:29.166 --> 27:32.133
- Hi, baby.
- My love.

27:33.266 --> 27:35.100
- Thank you.
- Rinna!

27:35.133 --> 27:37.667
- Hello! This is so exciting!

27:37.700 --> 27:39.734
This is your big night.

27:42.066 --> 27:45.300
- You look so pretty.
- Thank you, so do you.

27:47.266 --> 27:48.400
- Hello, Camille!
Thank you for coming.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.133
- Camille, hi!

27:50.166 --> 27:52.667
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Hello, how are you?

27:52.700 --> 27:54.200
- I think we've met once
before.

27:54.233 --> 27:57.100
- It's so good to see you.
- How are you?

27:59.367 --> 28:01.300
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:01.333 --> 28:03.400
- Hi, hon.
- Good to see you.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.200
- You look beautiful.
- So do you.

28:05.233 --> 28:06.333
- Is this your whole line,
and this is--

28:06.367 --> 28:08.233
- This is my athleisure. Yep.

28:08.266 --> 28:11.300
This is my signature camo.
You see the palm trees, guys?

28:11.333 --> 28:14.066
- I love it.
- Very cute.

28:14.100 --> 28:18.000
- This is the Camille.
- Is it? Oh, my God!

28:18.033 --> 28:20.166
I got something named after me.
It's the Camille.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.066
- Oh!
- I love that.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.734
- Congratulations.
- This is the Teddi.

28:24.767 --> 28:28.700
- Oh, cute!
- I love it.

28:28.734 --> 28:31.367
You know what? I love this,
'cause this is sporty.

28:31.400 --> 28:35.266
- The fact that Dorit went and
named a suit after Teddi is,

28:35.300 --> 28:38.266
like, the biggest olive branch
that I've ever seen.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.367
- I was left out on purpose.
Oh, that kind of sucks.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.100
- I don't have to make excuses
for it.

28:43.133 --> 28:45.100
It's my life, you know,
and I'm gonna name it

28:45.133 --> 28:49.000
after the women that really
bring something to my life.

28:49.033 --> 28:52.633
- Thank you.
- Very cool.

28:52.667 --> 28:57.700
- Maybe Dorit naming a cover-up
after Camille is really

28:57.734 --> 29:01.266
to signify that Camille
is always covering up

29:01.300 --> 29:03.633
her tracks.
It's kind of perfect.

29:03.667 --> 29:06.166
- The more time I spend
with you, the more I feel bad

29:06.200 --> 29:09.000
for anything
I've ever said in the past.

29:09.033 --> 29:10.333

a glass of champagne.

I've ever designed, guys.

- Are we going outside?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.700
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

29:42.734 --> 29:45.133
- If you live in LA,
everyone knows

29:45.166 --> 29:48.266
that seeing the Kitson window
is a big deal.

29:48.300 --> 29:50.133
- Cory, this is a big moment.

had about Lisa...

34:51.266 --> 34:53.567

to be here for me

34:53.600 --> 34:56.266
and to dismiss all of this.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.633
- Was completely contradictory
to what was said

34:58.667 --> 35:01.700
in the "People" magazine
interview

35:01.734 --> 35:03.700
saying Lisa's
been so amazing

35:03.734 --> 35:06.767
and that she was the one who
encouraged me to take the lead.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.467
- So we just felt, like,
a little punched.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.467

Do you know what I mean?

35:12.500 --> 35:15.700
I am absolutely doing my best
to be gentle with Camille.

It was, as we were pulling out,
and we're, like, reading

35:17.667 --> 35:20.300
the article,
we're just kind of like, "Ah!"

35:20.333 --> 35:22.467
And I don't necessarily
want to bring this up,

35:22.500 --> 35:25.033
but she gave me
the cue that said,

35:25.066 --> 35:27.033
"Let's talk about it.
I want to know."

35:27.066 --> 35:29.433

deliberately mean

35:29.467 --> 35:31.000
to hurt any of your feelings.

35:31.033 --> 35:32.467
- No, but that's very mature
of Camille

35:32.500 --> 35:34.033
that you're
able to separate it.

35:34.066 --> 35:35.633
- I'm actually surprised
it's coming up tonight,

35:35.667 --> 35:36.734
'cause I never thought
we'd ever mention it.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.467
You know what I mean?

- No, but I am so glad
you were because

35:40.600 --> 35:42.333
I have to be more in
the moment and say,

35:42.367 --> 35:43.667
"Hey, this is how I feel."

35:43.700 --> 35:45.633

is no middle ground.

whatever it is to appease you,

or she'll come
at you with a dagger.

35:51.633 --> 35:53.567
- But I think what's confusing
is if you say one thing...

35:53.600 --> 35:55.266
- And then you say something
to somebody else.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.033
- To us, and then you say
something else.

35:57.066 --> 36:01.233
To me, then I worry, "What is
she saying behind my back?"

36:03.567 --> 36:05.533
- Have I talked about some of
the girls behind their backs

36:05.567 --> 36:07.033
when they've hurt me?

36:07.066 --> 36:10.500
Yes, I have,
but I am fed up with Teddi

36:10.533 --> 36:14.000
always pushing herself
into these conversations.

36:14.033 --> 36:15.433
I'm sure you've said stuff
about me.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.033
Or maybe you haven't.
I don't know.

36:17.066 --> 36:18.533
- Everything I've said
I've said to your face,

36:18.567 --> 36:20.333
that you flip-flop...
- That's fine. Okay.

36:20.367 --> 36:21.600
- And you speak out of both
sides of your mouth.

36:21.633 --> 36:22.600
Both things I've said
to your face.

36:22.633 --> 36:23.667
- Okay. There you go.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.367
You know, Teddi, at times,

36:25.400 --> 36:27.400
has talked about
certain ladies, too,

36:27.433 --> 36:31.233
so she's not being
quite honest with herself.

36:31.266 --> 36:34.567
You know, we all need
to take a step back here

36:34.600 --> 36:37.400
and think about the things
we've said about each other.

36:37.433 --> 36:40.667
So I'm the flip-flopper,
and you're a know-it-all.

36:43.667 --> 36:46.266
- Fine.
- I've been called a lot worse.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.567
- Camille, you're a stupid
(BLEEP).

36:48.600 --> 36:51.333
- You're such a ----ing
liar, Camille.

36:51.367 --> 36:53.467
- Conniving,
passive-aggressive,

36:53.500 --> 36:56.767
narcissistic, catty,
jealous, cruel.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.533
- So like, that was easy.
- I know, and...

36:59.567 --> 37:01.333
- That was easy,
compared to the sh--

37:01.367 --> 37:02.734
that I've been through,
in the past.

37:02.767 --> 37:04.033
- I really didn't want
to mention this, but...

37:04.066 --> 37:05.567
- No, no. It's okay.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.066
- But I think it's best
to just get it out.

37:10.433 --> 37:12.700
- It came out I had said,
you know,

37:12.734 --> 37:14.734
that you said a few things
about Dorit, and you know--

37:14.767 --> 37:16.533
- Oh, yeah.
I've said some things.

37:16.567 --> 37:17.667
- She never told her
what you said.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.300
- No. I didn't.

37:19.333 --> 37:21.533
I had said, "Ask Camille."
I will tell you.

37:21.567 --> 37:24.533
It was before my 50th.
I had to get to know you.

37:24.567 --> 37:27.600
I didn't trust you. I didn't.
Dorit, I didn't.

37:27.633 --> 37:30.066
I didn't know where you were
getting all this money from.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.033
- What do you mean where I was
getting all what money from?

37:32.066 --> 37:34.467
- Well, I talked to...

37:34.500 --> 37:37.500
- What are you talking about?
- You want honesty?

37:37.533 --> 37:39.133
Do you really want to hear
what I have to say?

37:39.166 --> 37:42.133
People want to know
what I know.

37:42.166 --> 37:44.667
Be careful what you wish for
and what you ask for.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.734
[tense music]

37:52.667 --> 37:53.467
- I didn't know where you were

37:53.467 --> 37:54.166
- I didn't know where you were
getting all this money from.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.166
- What are you talking about?

37:57.200 --> 38:00.734
- Your husband was telling me
how he filed for bankruptcy.

38:03.567 --> 38:06.433
- So I'm the kid who ended up--
that grew up in a normal place

38:06.467 --> 38:09.400
and ended up a billionaire,
out of nowhere.

38:09.433 --> 38:11.633
And now, I got taken down,

38:11.667 --> 38:13.500
because if you get too big
for your boots,

38:13.533 --> 38:15.033
you get taken down.

38:15.066 --> 38:16.667
- It can happen.
- So you have to ride that.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.367
- And I was just like,

38:18.400 --> 38:21.500
"Wow. Where does she get
all this fancy cars?"

38:21.533 --> 38:23.500
This Bentley
she's driving around with.

38:23.533 --> 38:26.533
All these diamonds.
Your makeup. Your glam.

38:26.567 --> 38:28.633
Your clothes are outstanding.
They're beautiful.

38:28.667 --> 38:29.667
I always said that.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.500
Dorit comes across

38:31.533 --> 38:35.100
as somebody that's pretending
to be somebody she's not.

38:35.133 --> 38:38.433
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Oh, my God. No!

38:38.467 --> 38:41.367
- We're landing on a boat.
- Oh, my gosh.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.100
My husband's thoroughly
gonna kill me. $950.

38:45.133 --> 38:46.200
- In this town,
in Beverly Hills,

38:46.233 --> 38:49.100
you have to be leery of people

38:49.133 --> 38:51.400
that live way
beyond their means,

38:51.433 --> 38:53.433
because you don't know
who's trying to be your friend

38:53.467 --> 38:55.633
that's in it
for the wrong reasons.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.133
- My husband built a
$2 billion business from zero.

38:58.166 --> 38:59.633
- And I think that's fantastic.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.633
- Let me finish.
Let me clear it up for you.

39:01.667 --> 39:04.066
- Okay.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.633
- In 2008,
his business went bust.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.100
He claimed bankruptcy.

39:07.133 --> 39:08.433
- Yeah, and he was
talking about it.

39:08.467 --> 39:10.000
- Much like many,
many successful men.

39:10.033 --> 39:11.433
- Yes. Yes, and he was
very honest about it.

39:11.467 --> 39:13.100
- But what does that have
to do with today?

39:13.133 --> 39:15.033
This is 10 years ago.
What are you talking about?

39:15.066 --> 39:16.700
- Your husband owes out
a lot of money

39:16.734 --> 39:19.467
to somebody
very, very close to me.

39:20.700 --> 39:26.600
- Oh, please.
- No. It's true. No. It's true.

39:26.633 --> 39:28.467
- This crosses a line.
- No, this is real.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.767
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
Give it to me.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.500
- You came after me.
I'm telling you--

39:31.533 --> 39:32.600
- I came after you!
- This crosses a line.

39:32.633 --> 39:34.567
- Yes, you did.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.266
- PK doesn't owe any of your
friends any money, sweetheart.

39:36.300 --> 39:37.633
- You wanted to know
what I said.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.066
- You were sitting there

39:39.100 --> 39:41.066
talking about
our financial state.

39:41.100 --> 39:43.066
- But you didn't go as far
as you just went now.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.200
- I just feel that, you know,

39:45.233 --> 39:46.700
Dorit--there's a little bit
of phoniness,

39:46.734 --> 39:48.567
and I don't know
where she's at.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.433
Like, I don't know if she has
all the money she has,

39:50.467 --> 39:53.000
or is it a show?

39:53.033 --> 39:56.567
- You were more vague.
I'm sorry.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.100
I know what going after
somebody's husband is.

39:59.133 --> 40:00.700
But no. Wait. Excuse me.

40:00.734 --> 40:02.433
Did you just say,
"Let's talk about the husband?"

40:02.467 --> 40:04.100
- Let's not talk about
what you don't want out.

40:04.133 --> 40:07.100
- Never go near my husband.

40:07.133 --> 40:08.266
- Everybody will know.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.033
- Do you ----ing
understand that?

40:10.066 --> 40:11.600
Don't you ever go
after my ----ing husband!

40:11.633 --> 40:13.066
- Everybody will know, bitch.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.166
- You just don't ----ing do it.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.767
Thank you.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.633
- I know things, for certain.
I know for certain.

40:21.667 --> 40:24.700
- Listen, you can give me
whatever you want, Camille.

40:24.734 --> 40:26.200
Whatever you think--
- You don't want me to.

40:26.233 --> 40:27.734
You don't want me to.

40:27.767 --> 40:29.100
- Camille, don't you dare
threaten me, sweetheart.

40:29.133 --> 40:31.066
- I'm not threatening.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.200
- Let me tell you something--
- I want--I'm protecting you.

40:32.233 --> 40:33.600
I'm protecting you right now.

40:33.633 --> 40:35.066
- You're protecting me?
- Oh, yes.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.500
- You're a little snake.
That's what you are.

40:37.533 --> 40:39.166
- No, I'm not.
I'm protecting you.

40:39.200 --> 40:43.567
It seems like there's things
that maybe PK hasn't been

40:43.600 --> 40:46.033
so open about,
in their financial situation.

40:46.066 --> 40:48.600
- You want to go low?
We'll go low.

40:48.633 --> 40:50.266
- I'm trying to protect you.

40:50.300 --> 40:52.200
- Oh, you know what?
(BLEEP) off, Camille.

40:52.233 --> 40:54.200
- I don't want
to say something,

40:54.233 --> 40:56.600
because maybe she doesn't know
what's going on,

40:56.633 --> 40:58.667
or maybe her husband's
not telling her everything.

40:58.700 --> 41:00.100
- Honestly.
- Don't tell me to ----ing...

41:00.133 --> 41:01.767
you called me a (BLEEP)
last year.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.700
- Honestly, I don't even want
to hear it right now.

41:03.734 --> 41:05.633
- I can't with this
----ing girl. I can't.

41:05.667 --> 41:10.266
- I know your husband owes
over $1 million to a company.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.266
- Don't say anything else.
- Oh, I can't wait to tell PK.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.600
Oof.

41:14.633 --> 41:16.600
- Camille?
- It's bad.

41:16.633 --> 41:18.700
There's lawyers involved too.

41:18.734 --> 41:22.300
- Don't indulge her.
- What's going on, baby?

41:22.333 --> 41:23.734
- Just keep eating.

41:23.767 --> 41:25.500
- Sweetheart, I'm done talking
to you

41:25.533 --> 41:26.767
and all of the nonsense
that you have.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.500
- Okay, fine.
It's not nonsense.

41:28.533 --> 41:29.667
- And you know what?
For everybody, as far as--

41:29.700 --> 41:31.166
- It's the truth.
I'm not lying.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.667
- Camille...
- I told her I didn't want

41:32.700 --> 41:34.100
to talk about this...
- You need to stop.

41:34.133 --> 41:35.667
- Because I wanted
to protect her.

41:35.700 --> 41:36.667
- Don't. Protecting is not
saying anything, at all.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.166
Stop.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.100
- Okay. Then I won't.
- Please.

41:40.133 --> 41:42.133
- But then, if I don't say
anything, then I'm two-faced?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.633
- This crosses a ----ing line.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.567
This involves her husband.
It's--

41:45.600 --> 41:47.600
- Camille, maybe you should
do this in private.

41:47.633 --> 41:49.567
- I don't think
the timing was great.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.633
- It's not great.
It wasn't great.

41:51.667 --> 41:56.000
- I don't think this is great
though, either, so--

41:56.033 --> 41:57.533
- This, everybody
just gets hurt.

41:57.567 --> 41:59.066
- This crosses a ----ing line.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.000
- This has to stop.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:01.033 --> 42:02.567
Go around and attack Camille--

42:02.600 --> 42:04.233
- It was not a go-around.
It wasn't.

42:04.266 --> 42:05.533
- I'm saying you talking...

42:05.567 --> 42:07.000
- Lisa.
- It felt like that.

42:07.033 --> 42:08.300
One, after another,
after another.

42:08.333 --> 42:09.767
- I didn't say anything.
- At some point,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.266
it does feel overwhelming.

42:12.300 --> 42:16.266
- Where you went is so low,
as far as I'm concerned.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.700
- Because you kept
coming after me.

42:17.734 --> 42:19.667
- Okay.

42:19.700 --> 42:21.266
- But that's not--two wrongs
don't make a right either.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.367
- That is true. That is true.
- But we don't--

42:23.400 --> 42:25.100
- But she's denying something
that I know.

42:25.133 --> 42:26.367
- Go below the belt.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.367
We don't go below
the ----ing belt.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.066
- I've seen Camille talk out
of both sides of her mouth,

42:31.100 --> 42:32.300
but this Camille?

42:32.333 --> 42:35.700
She's downright
vicious and mean.

42:35.734 --> 42:38.300
After tonight, I'm done.

42:38.333 --> 42:40.667
- There are certain things
we don't--you know,

42:40.700 --> 42:42.166
don't need to be talked about,

42:42.200 --> 42:45.767
at a big ----ing table
at goddamn dinner.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.734
- Yeah. There you go.

42:48.767 --> 42:51.033
- Yep.
- Anywho, before that,

42:51.066 --> 42:53.200
I had a really nice time
with all of you, at dinner.

42:53.233 --> 42:56.100
- Well, I tell you what.
- This is like a round table.

42:56.133 --> 42:58.033
[all speaking at once]

42:58.066 --> 43:00.066
- But it's okay.

43:00.100 --> 43:01.700
- I'll see you all Thursday.
- Yeah.

43:01.734 --> 43:04.066
- Sounds great.

43:05.266 --> 43:08.000
- Next time,
on the season finale

43:08.033 --> 43:10.200
of "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

43:10.233 --> 43:11.767
- Hey, girl.
I'm wearing a wig tonight.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.367
- Wearing a wig tonight.
Me too.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.100
- Thank you guys so much
for being here.

43:16.133 --> 43:20.300
I am just so incredibly proud
of my husband

43:20.333 --> 43:22.767
and all of you guys in the--

43:23.000 --> 43:24.633
- I did not come after you.
- That was not cool.

43:24.667 --> 43:27.200
- I was honest with you.
- How disgusting are you?

43:27.233 --> 43:29.066
- Do you know what?
- So let's figure out

43:29.100 --> 43:31.300
who the mean girl really is.

43:31.333 --> 43:32.767
And when I found out

43:33.000 --> 43:34.367
that she slapped my daughter
I was disgusted.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.734
- You know I never
slapped your daughter.

43:35.767 --> 43:37.266
- That's not how
my daughter tells it.

43:37.300 --> 43:38.734
- Camille, you know when we
go through...

43:38.767 --> 43:41.233
- No, I don't know,
Denise, so back off.

43:41.266 --> 43:42.667
- You ----ing back off.

43:42.700 --> 43:46.033
- All hail Lisa Vanderpump.

43:46.066 --> 43:48.266
[cheers and applause]

43:48.300 --> 43:50.233
- I'm sorry about you and Kyle.

43:50.266 --> 43:52.233
- If you love somebody,
