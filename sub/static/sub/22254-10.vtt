00:14.858 --> 00:16.817
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

00:16.818 --> 00:19.629
Think she's dreaming that
she's not overstaying her welcome?

00:19.696 --> 00:21.864
When she got that wine delivered
to the house,

00:21.865 --> 00:24.825
I thought that was her thank-you present,
that she was leaving,

00:24.826 --> 00:27.578
- but then she just drank the wine.
- Five days ago.

00:27.579 --> 00:29.306
- Morning, everybody.
- Aah! Kinko!

00:29.372 --> 00:32.558
Another beautiful day
in the city of Brotherly Angels.

00:32.667 --> 00:36.212
Todd, I don't recall
accidentally ingesting poison,

00:36.213 --> 00:38.398
and yet here you are
trying to make me vomit.

00:38.464 --> 00:41.109
You wanna go buy me a kite
and then fly a kite?

00:41.176 --> 00:42.986
No. Kites are sky trash.

00:43.053 --> 00:47.740
Why is it so daytime right now?

00:47.807 --> 00:48.724
Wanda?

00:49.976 --> 00:53.205
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?
That's what I call wind.

00:53.272 --> 00:55.231
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

00:55.232 --> 00:57.441
Not all of us. Just some of us.

00:57.442 --> 00:59.627
Oh, yeah, my job.

01:01.487 --> 01:02.780
- Morning.
- What?

01:02.781 --> 01:06.450
I'm done with my sabbatical
and I'm ready to get back to work.

01:06.451 --> 01:08.202
What sabbatical? I fired you.

01:08.203 --> 01:10.621
Oh, I thought
when you said, "You're fired,"

01:10.622 --> 01:13.457
that was just you
"giving me the business."

01:13.458 --> 01:15.894
No, I was taking the "business"
away from you.

01:15.919 --> 01:17.478
Oh.

01:17.837 --> 01:20.380
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
You wanna go fly a kite?

01:20.381 --> 01:22.674
Put me down
for a supersized "sounds great."

01:22.675 --> 01:25.987
But with an even larger main course
of "sadly, I cannot."

01:26.054 --> 01:29.848
I am swamped here at work.
First, I gotta put my suit on.

01:29.849 --> 01:31.576
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

01:31.643 --> 01:33.245
Then we record the show.

01:33.312 --> 01:35.538
And then I gotta take my suit off.

01:35.605 --> 01:38.607
So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

01:43.322 --> 01:44.214
Ah.

01:44.323 --> 01:45.506
"Looking for a friend?"

01:45.573 --> 01:46.799
Yes.

01:46.866 --> 01:48.218
"Need direction?"

01:48.285 --> 01:49.635
I'm listening.

01:49.702 --> 01:52.013
"Try Scientology"?

01:52.080 --> 01:54.081
- Huh.
- Excuse me? Sir?

01:54.082 --> 01:55.415
- Huh?
- Have you ever thought

01:55.416 --> 01:57.852
about trying improv comedy?

01:57.877 --> 02:01.606
Improv comedy? I don't know...

02:01.673 --> 02:04.091
Why not?
It's not like there's anything else to do.

02:04.092 --> 02:05.610
Here on Mars.

02:05.677 --> 02:07.028
We're on Mars?

02:07.095 --> 02:11.807
Yes. And in a Martian ice cream shop.
Care for a butterscotch swirl?

02:11.808 --> 02:12.909
Whoa!

02:12.976 --> 02:15.536
The only limit is my imagination.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.397
Why not come by our theater
and try a free class?

02:18.398 --> 02:22.484
Okay!
Can I bring this food inside the theater?

02:22.485 --> 02:24.236
Ha, good one.

02:24.237 --> 02:26.589
- But no.
- Oh.

03:23.463 --> 03:26.257
"That's when I learned
that guns can blow a vato away.

03:26.258 --> 03:30.510
But calculus?
Calculus can blow a mind away."

03:30.511 --> 03:31.779
Cut!

03:31.846 --> 03:32.947
We got it!

03:33.014 --> 03:34.598
That's the day, everybody.

03:35.725 --> 03:39.603
- You sure we got it, Abe?
- Of course. You were phenomenal.

03:39.604 --> 03:42.707
Really? Because that kid sneezed
in the middle of my monologue.

03:42.774 --> 03:45.484
- We can fix that in post.
- Abe, I'm supposed to tell you

03:45.485 --> 03:47.319
the boom mike fell into the last shot.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.114
You sure you don't wanna get another take?
Just for safety?

03:50.115 --> 03:53.092
What am I, Kubrick?
We can fix all this stuff in post.

03:53.159 --> 03:55.119
It's an easy scene.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.457
Secretariat's a nice guy,
the Spanish kids learn a lesson.

03:59.458 --> 04:00.975
Boom. Bam! Done!

04:01.042 --> 04:04.187
But Secretariat never actually taught math
in South Central.

04:04.296 --> 04:08.132
I don't know what Secretariat did
or didn't do. I wasn't there.

04:08.133 --> 04:11.093
- Yeah, but...
- Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

04:11.094 --> 04:12.529
we'll give them gangbangers.

04:12.595 --> 04:14.906
- We get paid either way, right?
- I guess.

04:14.973 --> 04:18.142
I can't wait to get home.
I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

04:18.142 --> 04:19.452
You like coq au vin?

04:19.519 --> 04:22.562
I think so. Is that the move
where a French girl pours soup in...

04:22.563 --> 04:24.106
Come over for dinner, okay?

04:24.107 --> 04:25.500
- You'll love it.
- Okay.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.986
Chin up, big guy.
So, we ain't making Casablanca.

04:33.241 --> 04:35.200
- BoJack. Shut up.
- Aah! What are you...?

04:35.201 --> 04:36.701
No one can know I'm here.

04:36.702 --> 04:38.763
- What?
- Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

04:38.830 --> 04:41.832
As you know, you're my favorite client.

04:41.833 --> 04:44.644
If I left Vigor,
would you follow me to a new agency?

04:44.669 --> 04:47.587
Sure, but no one's gonna hire me
after this movie comes out.

04:47.588 --> 04:51.216
The script turned into a piece of shit,
and the director is a total hack.

04:51.217 --> 04:52.527
Good guy, total hack.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.012
Let's get you something
before the movie comes out.

04:55.013 --> 04:58.032
We got an offer in for this new play
off-Broadway.

04:58.099 --> 04:59.867
Theater? That's what real actors do.

04:59.934 --> 05:02.495
Yeah, I told them that,
but they said she wanted you.

05:02.562 --> 05:05.063
- She?
- Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.

05:05.064 --> 05:06.940
- She came out of nowhere.
- Jill Pill?

05:06.941 --> 05:09.443
New York Magazine called her
the enfant terrible

05:09.444 --> 05:10.944
of the immersive theater world,

05:10.945 --> 05:13.381
and then later clarified
that that's a compliment.

05:13.448 --> 05:16.033
It sounds like the kind of thing
I should be doing now.

05:16.034 --> 05:19.411
- Something artistic and bold.
- Rehearsals start in two weeks.

05:19.412 --> 05:21.681
Are you ready to go to New York
for six months?

05:21.747 --> 05:24.416
New York's a great city to live in
for six months

05:24.417 --> 05:27.937
and not a second longer and only
if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

05:31.132 --> 05:33.192
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.177
Apple sauce!

05:35.178 --> 05:36.321
Oh-ho!

05:36.388 --> 05:37.637
That was so funny.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.140
Which one of you guys
wrote all those funny jokes?

05:40.141 --> 05:44.663
No, Todd, here at Shenanigags,
we make things up on the spot.

05:44.729 --> 05:47.856
- Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.
- Uh... I don't know.

05:47.857 --> 05:49.083
Suggestions?

05:50.068 --> 05:52.211
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

05:52.237 --> 05:54.964
- Way to break the fourth wall.
- That wasn't that funny.

05:55.031 --> 05:58.009
My name's Bryan
and you haven't won me over yet.

05:58.076 --> 05:59.784
- Oh, Bryan.
- Todd, in improv,

05:59.785 --> 06:03.080
we get suggestions from an audience
then make up scenes based on them.

06:03.081 --> 06:06.708
There are just a few simple rules.
You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

06:06.709 --> 06:10.813
No matter what. When someone makes a
suggestion, you always try to build on it.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.815
We call that "yes, and..."

06:12.882 --> 06:17.302
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.
It's all part of the fun.

06:17.303 --> 06:18.863
Is it really that simple?

06:18.930 --> 06:22.534
Ugh! It's incredibly complicated
and requires years of training.

06:22.601 --> 06:23.517
Oh, Bryan.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.648
But improv isn't just about a constant
clamoring for attention and validation.

06:29.649 --> 06:30.732
It's about community.

06:30.733 --> 06:33.277
I've always wanted to be part
of a community.

06:33.278 --> 06:35.796
Well, you are now.
Your first class is $200.

06:35.821 --> 06:37.739
I thought you said it was free.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.468
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

06:43.829 --> 06:45.747
I am so proud of you.

06:45.748 --> 06:49.268
Every day I'm telling people all about
the great stuff you're doing there.

06:49.377 --> 06:52.438
- Yeah, I don't know...
- And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."

06:52.505 --> 06:55.340
And I say, "I'm here to confirm
she is an incredible woman."

06:55.341 --> 06:57.217
- Well...
- You know, the sound guy's wife

06:57.218 --> 06:58.677
works with at-risk teens.

06:58.678 --> 07:02.681
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay,
but compared to what my wife is doing,

07:02.682 --> 07:04.450
- your wife is bullshit!"
- Oh.

07:04.517 --> 07:05.951
And he had to agree with me.

07:06.018 --> 07:07.870
- Um...
- Because I am his boss.

07:07.937 --> 07:10.331
- Listen...
- Let me talk to one of the locals.

07:10.398 --> 07:14.126
I wanna hear someone else talk
about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

07:14.193 --> 07:16.003
- Oh, uh...
- Ah, now come on.

07:16.070 --> 07:19.197
- Most refugees got their tongues cut out.
- Find one with a tongue.

07:19.198 --> 07:20.841
- I don't think...
- Indulge me.

07:20.866 --> 07:21.825
Okay.

07:21.826 --> 07:25.304
Hello. I am refugee from village.

07:25.371 --> 07:28.433
Hey, what's your name, Superstar?

07:28.500 --> 07:31.519
Uh, my name is...

07:34.880 --> 07:36.566
Coffee Maker.

07:36.633 --> 07:40.403
Ah. Kofi Makir.
Am I pronouncing that right?

07:43.473 --> 07:46.975
Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs
in class today.

07:46.976 --> 07:50.246
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene
was so innovative.

07:50.313 --> 07:51.247
Eh...

07:51.314 --> 07:53.249
- Oh, Bryan.
- Guys, look.

07:53.316 --> 07:54.566
It's Copernicus.

07:55.735 --> 07:57.486
- Who's that?
- What are you, new?

07:57.487 --> 07:59.004
Yes, I am new.

07:59.071 --> 08:01.490
Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.

08:01.491 --> 08:03.950
That guy is the Jan-Ove Waldner
of modern improv.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.054
- Who is Jan-Ove Waldner?
- The Michael Jordan of table tennis.

08:07.121 --> 08:08.222
Oh.

08:08.289 --> 08:10.349
- Let's go talk to him.
- Are you kidding?

08:10.416 --> 08:12.501
You can't just go up and talk
to Copernicus.

08:12.502 --> 08:15.521
Man, Todd, you don't know shit.
You're just a tourist.

08:15.547 --> 08:16.648
No, I'm not.

08:16.715 --> 08:19.734
If you're one of us, prove it.
Go improv that lady over there.

08:20.176 --> 08:21.110
Freestyle.

08:21.177 --> 08:23.261
No audience, no net.

08:23.262 --> 08:25.930
- I don't know...
- Hey, if you're down with the prov,

08:25.931 --> 08:27.241
you gotta prove that prov.

08:27.308 --> 08:29.661
All right. I'll do it.

08:30.729 --> 08:34.147
- Hello, old ma'am.
- Oh, hello.

08:34.148 --> 08:37.984
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.
Have you seen her?

08:37.985 --> 08:38.961
Yes,

08:39.028 --> 08:42.006
and she exploded?

08:42.073 --> 08:43.907
Doris exploded?

08:43.908 --> 08:46.410
- You just got prov'd!
- In your face, lady!

08:46.411 --> 08:47.661
The streets are ours!

08:47.662 --> 08:50.931
- Hurray, improv! I did it!
- You have briefly won me over.

08:53.459 --> 08:55.770
Poor Doris...

08:58.297 --> 09:01.049
That is not what I thought coq au vin was.
But it's great.

09:01.050 --> 09:04.219
Well, I'm no Emeril Lagasse,
but we do get by.

09:04.220 --> 09:06.722
- Oh, stop.
- Bam!

09:06.723 --> 09:08.766
Like Emeril? Ha, remember that?

09:08.767 --> 09:09.701
He said "bam."

09:09.768 --> 09:12.394
I don't know who Emeril is,
but he sounds delightful.

09:12.395 --> 09:14.079
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

09:14.146 --> 09:17.315
BoJack, Abe tells me
you guys are almost done with the movie.

09:17.316 --> 09:19.335
One week left!

09:19.402 --> 09:22.213
You two lovebirds gonna do
any traveling or anything?

09:22.280 --> 09:25.532
I'll be traveling back and forth
to New York for the next few months

09:25.533 --> 09:28.260
because BoJack's doing a play there
after you finish.

09:28.327 --> 09:29.620
- Oh, I love plays.
- A play.

09:29.621 --> 09:32.247
That's my favorite place
to eat crinkly candies.

09:32.248 --> 09:35.226
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work
on something good, you know?

09:35.668 --> 09:36.602
Oh?

09:36.669 --> 09:40.439
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.
It has been a really painless shoot,

09:40.465 --> 09:42.765
even though the movie's gonna be
a piece of shit, right?

09:43.426 --> 09:45.862
- What?
- Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

09:45.928 --> 09:47.178
Like shipshape?

09:47.179 --> 09:49.514
Anyway, what were we talking about?
Who knows?

09:49.515 --> 09:51.349
- Okay, moving on.
- Hey, it's fine.

09:51.350 --> 09:52.785
Abe knows what we're making.

09:53.436 --> 09:54.352
Right?

09:55.480 --> 09:59.333
- Wanda, would you help me with dessert?
- Uh, okay.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.655
Yeah.
New York is so great in the summer,

10:04.656 --> 10:08.032
but I don't think
we're going to be done in time.

10:08.033 --> 10:10.261
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

10:10.328 --> 10:12.162
- Are you kidding?
- Well, you know,

10:12.163 --> 10:15.307
because the movie's such a piece of shit
and all.

10:15.374 --> 10:16.916
Did that hurt your feelings?

10:16.917 --> 10:19.771
I mean, you're the one who said
we're not making Casablanca.

10:19.879 --> 10:24.090
Right, because Casablanca is a movie
about a club owner named Rick.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.760
This movie's about Secretariat,
a racehorse.

10:26.761 --> 10:32.157
Wait, you literally meant we're not making
the actual movie Casablanca?

10:32.224 --> 10:36.144
That movie already exists.
Why would we make Casablanca?

10:36.145 --> 10:39.916
- This is a different movie.
- I think there was a misunderstanding.

10:39.982 --> 10:43.168
Wrong, boy-o.
There was a mister-understanding.

10:43.235 --> 10:46.822
And that mister is me
understanding you just fine.

10:46.823 --> 10:49.366
You come into my home
and you call my work shit?

10:49.367 --> 10:51.409
- You know what I think? You're shit.
- What?

10:51.410 --> 10:54.538
You think I don't get enough takes?
I'll get more takes.

10:54.539 --> 10:57.057
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

10:58.793 --> 11:02.313
Well, don't go.
We haven't had dessert yet.

11:02.421 --> 11:05.006
Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.

11:05.007 --> 11:07.777
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.970
Because it's a different kind of pie?

11:10.971 --> 11:13.198
That's right.

11:15.393 --> 11:17.352
Why did you have to antagonize him?

11:17.353 --> 11:19.145
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

11:19.146 --> 11:22.500
- He said, "It's no Casablanca."
- Well, what's done is done.

11:22.567 --> 11:25.044
You're happy.
You didn't want me to go to New York.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.528
Lucky me, I get to stay here

11:26.529 --> 11:28.965
and work on this movie
that's gonna ruin my career.

11:29.031 --> 11:31.091
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

11:31.158 --> 11:34.536
Or you could sulk about it.

11:34.537 --> 11:36.221
Diane does raise some good points.

11:36.288 --> 11:37.205
No, she doesn't.

11:37.206 --> 11:41.393
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person
you wanna be going to for life advice now.

11:41.460 --> 11:44.897
Why? Just because I've been drinking
myself to sleep on your deck chairs

11:44.923 --> 11:49.092
and lying to my husband for the last week?
Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.

11:49.093 --> 11:51.362
I knew I kept these things around
for a reason.

11:52.221 --> 11:56.600
- I just had the most amazing prov sesh.
- No one cares, Todd.

11:56.601 --> 11:59.394
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?
Make a suggestion.

11:59.395 --> 12:02.146
- Stop.
- Aah. Sorry, officer,

12:02.147 --> 12:04.566
I didn't see that stop sign.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.044
Yes.

12:06.110 --> 12:07.444
And my car runs on farts.

12:07.445 --> 12:08.403
Ugh!

12:08.404 --> 12:10.488
- Stop. No, stop it.
- Please stop.

12:10.489 --> 12:11.716
Not a suggestion.

12:12.700 --> 12:16.136
Okay.
I just hope I impress the elder council.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.955
I want to become a Level Two,

12:17.956 --> 12:22.810
so I can finally achieve clarity
on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.

12:22.877 --> 12:24.729
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.338
What? No, improv is not a cult.

12:27.339 --> 12:29.274
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

12:29.341 --> 12:31.509
taught by a for-profit organization

12:31.510 --> 12:34.405
with the promise of social
and professional opportunities.

12:34.472 --> 12:37.116
- Ahh.
- It's a cult. And I know.

12:37.182 --> 12:41.370
I learned a little about cults
during that year I was a Scientologist.

12:41.437 --> 12:44.105
Coincidentally during that year,
I read a book about cults.

12:44.106 --> 12:46.190
Wait, are you saying
Scientology is a cult?

12:46.191 --> 12:49.193
No, Scientology is not a cult.

12:49.194 --> 12:50.755
Improv is a cult.

12:50.822 --> 12:54.675
I wanna be very clear.
This is about improv.

12:54.742 --> 12:58.328
- I really don't think it's that bad, guys.
- Why does anything matter, right?

12:58.329 --> 13:00.580
Love is an illusion,
and happiness is fleeting,

13:00.581 --> 13:04.042
no such thing as God, and all your
favorite musicians beat their wives.

13:04.043 --> 13:06.145
Allegedly.

13:06.879 --> 13:07.963
Would you talk to her?

13:07.964 --> 13:09.023
Yes.

13:09.089 --> 13:13.092
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.887
Heyyy... Hitler.

13:15.888 --> 13:16.906
Please stop.

13:19.266 --> 13:23.394
President Lohan!
Get away from that fire hose!

13:23.395 --> 13:24.813
Fire hose!

13:24.814 --> 13:26.791
Sorry I'm late, guys!

13:26.858 --> 13:29.860
Todd, we take tardiness seriously here
at Shenanigags.

13:29.861 --> 13:34.364
- If you miss one more class, you're out.
- I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.

13:34.365 --> 13:37.492
- He's later than I am.
- Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.

13:37.493 --> 13:41.263
He's been negative, so Copernicus thought
he could benefit from some time away.

13:41.330 --> 13:44.976
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags
comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.

13:45.376 --> 13:48.646
- Is that a reward or a punishment?
- That's up to Bryan.

13:48.671 --> 13:51.065
Let's have no more questions
about the Giggleship.

13:51.674 --> 13:52.883
Oh, uh, all right.

13:52.884 --> 13:55.886
Well, you know,
I was actually talking to my best friend,

13:55.887 --> 13:59.138
and he said improv is a cult.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.075
I mean, that's crazy, right?

14:06.564 --> 14:09.399
If you think Shenanigags is a cult,
you're free to go, Todd.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.069
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.
I love this place.

14:12.070 --> 14:15.089
My friend just doesn't know
how great you guys are.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.009
It sounds like your friend's
not yes-and'ing you.

14:18.076 --> 14:19.784
Invite him to your graduation show.

14:19.785 --> 14:23.329
If he's too negative to support you,
you should take a good hard think

14:23.330 --> 14:26.058
about if that's the kind of energy
you want in your life.

14:26.125 --> 14:29.728
I hate good hard thinks.

14:33.091 --> 14:35.759
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.
But I... I gotta go.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.762
I'm...
Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

14:38.763 --> 14:41.598
The kids get jealous
if I'm talking on the phone.

14:41.599 --> 14:42.849
Uh, okay, bye.

14:42.850 --> 14:44.225
So, hey, hi.

14:44.226 --> 14:47.478
How long are you thinking of staying here?
Just for my own reference.

14:47.479 --> 14:50.666
Oh, shit.
Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

14:50.733 --> 14:52.316
No one is making me do anything.

14:52.317 --> 14:54.503
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

14:54.528 --> 14:55.462
Well, yeah.

14:56.155 --> 15:00.366
I really thought I could do it. I thought
I could go far away and help people

15:00.367 --> 15:02.911
and be this best possible version
of myself.

15:02.912 --> 15:04.013
And what happened?

15:04.080 --> 15:05.663
I couldn't.

15:05.664 --> 15:07.975
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

15:08.417 --> 15:11.229
I'd love to stay and wallow with you,
but I gotta head out.

15:11.295 --> 15:15.256
Today we're filming what used to be the
scene where Secretariat commits suicide,

15:15.257 --> 15:17.759
but is now a scene where he swims
in a fishing hole

15:17.760 --> 15:20.470
- with his girlfriend "Susie Side."
- Yeesh.

15:20.471 --> 15:23.723
If you wanna blow off work,
I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

15:23.724 --> 15:26.434
drink beer, and watch old episodes
of Horsin' Around.

15:26.435 --> 15:27.369
Hmm.

15:28.604 --> 15:30.897
And if I hear one more peep out of you...

15:33.109 --> 15:36.277
- Sabrina!
- What? I didn't peep!

15:36.278 --> 15:38.256
Oh!

15:39.657 --> 15:42.033
Sabrina was such a little bitch.

15:42.034 --> 15:44.577
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

15:44.578 --> 15:48.206
Hey, Diane, you're still here.
And BoJack is here.

15:48.207 --> 15:49.457
Did you go to work today?

15:49.458 --> 15:52.169
I was gonna, but then I remembered
everything is garbage,

15:52.170 --> 15:53.586
so why bother doing anything?

15:53.587 --> 15:55.898
- True story.
- Okay.

15:55.923 --> 15:57.841
Oh, you didn't.

15:59.093 --> 16:01.094
Oh, you did.

16:06.058 --> 16:08.244
- Hello.
- Hey, could you get the door?

16:08.769 --> 16:10.037
- Whoa.
- Mm.

16:10.104 --> 16:12.856
The property's gonna be ready in June.
Gives us two months

16:12.857 --> 16:14.941
to get everything we need
out of this place.

16:14.942 --> 16:15.859
Mm. Perfect.

16:15.860 --> 16:18.903
Just so you know, I had to register
the corporation in your name.

16:18.904 --> 16:20.989
- What?
- Just until the divorce is finalized.

16:20.990 --> 16:23.383
Katie's lawyers are watching me closely
right now.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.367
They're hawks.

16:24.368 --> 16:26.577
I mean, not literally.
Well, one literally.

16:26.578 --> 16:28.639
Know what, actually, he might be a falcon.

16:28.706 --> 16:29.831
Rutabaga, this is too...

16:29.832 --> 16:32.291
This is a temporary technicality,
I promise.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.961
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.
Okay?

16:34.962 --> 16:35.896
Mm. Mm.

16:35.963 --> 16:38.565
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,
so I just... Ooh.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.383
- Oh, hello.
- Look at this urn.

16:40.384 --> 16:42.177
What's going on in here?

16:42.178 --> 16:43.904
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

16:43.971 --> 16:49.285
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency,
and we want you to come with us.

16:49.351 --> 16:52.520
Well, well, well, what delicious irony.

16:52.521 --> 16:55.899
It appears the cat is chasing the dog.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.084
Are you in or out?

16:57.151 --> 16:58.068
Are you kidding?

16:58.069 --> 17:01.255
You're the agent who got me
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities.

17:01.363 --> 17:02.655
- Well...
- What do they know?

17:02.656 --> 17:04.281
- Right, so...
- Do they know things?

17:04.282 --> 17:05.657
- Okay...
- Let's find out.

17:05.659 --> 17:07.077
- Right...
- Big fan.

17:07.078 --> 17:08.387
I like you guys.

17:08.453 --> 17:11.039
I like your hustle
and I like your matching lipstick.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.582
- Well, um...
- I am in.

17:12.583 --> 17:13.767
Mm-hm.

17:16.627 --> 17:18.480
Go home, Goober.

17:18.589 --> 17:19.672
Yeah! Go home, Goober!

17:19.673 --> 17:22.651
Goober sucks.
Why doesn't he ever go home?

17:22.718 --> 17:24.778
Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.

17:24.845 --> 17:27.071
- You suck, Goober!
- Hey, Goober! Get murdered!

17:27.138 --> 17:29.574
Go sit on a sharp dick, you piece of shit.

17:30.726 --> 17:32.310
- Hey, guys.
- Shut up, Todd.

17:32.311 --> 17:34.771
BoJack, listen, I... Oh!

17:34.772 --> 17:37.148
- Hey, whoa!
- Boo! Party foul!

17:37.149 --> 17:39.400
- You knocked over Bucking-can Palace.
- Come on!

17:39.401 --> 17:41.337
Uh, sorry, I'll clean that up later.

17:41.403 --> 17:44.948
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later."
Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

17:44.949 --> 17:46.300
Clean up your shit, Todd.

17:46.366 --> 17:51.096
BoJack, I wanted to invite you
to my graduation show tomorrow night.

17:51.163 --> 17:53.081
- What?
- Look, I know you think

17:53.082 --> 17:56.310
it's just a dumb cult,
but you're my best friend

17:56.376 --> 17:59.021
and it would really mean a lot
if you came.

17:59.088 --> 18:03.734
I'm gonna go down to the basement
to practice my space work.

18:03.759 --> 18:07.905
And here I am going downstairs.

18:10.141 --> 18:11.075
Hello?

18:11.142 --> 18:15.204
- What kind of pants are you wearing now?
- What? I don't know. The normal kind.

18:15.271 --> 18:18.165
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?
A comfy pair of pants?

18:18.232 --> 18:19.791
I guess. Why?

18:19.858 --> 18:22.193
Just wondering
what kind of hit you're gonna take

18:22.194 --> 18:25.672
when the studio sues the pants off you
for breach of contract.

18:25.739 --> 18:28.491
They're suing me?
Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

18:28.492 --> 18:30.761
Because that was a long road to walk
to get to that punch line.

18:30.828 --> 18:33.121
- This is serious.
- We're not just doing bits?

18:33.122 --> 18:34.890
You started it with the pants thing.

18:34.957 --> 18:38.518
You need to go back to set.
You can't just not go to work.

18:39.503 --> 18:41.730
Remember, you wanted this.

18:44.591 --> 18:48.695
Are you saying you're finally ready
to settle down with yours truly?

18:48.762 --> 18:51.264
Darn tootin'.
I may be a professional racehorse,

18:51.265 --> 18:53.016
but I'm tired of running in circles.

18:53.017 --> 18:53.951
Cut!

18:54.018 --> 18:56.661
Perfect.
But let's get that last part again.

18:56.728 --> 19:01.774
- Anything you want me to do differently?
- No, I just think we should get it again.

19:01.775 --> 19:03.651
You know, for safety.

19:03.652 --> 19:06.546
- Action!
- I'm tired of running in circles.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.215
And again?

19:08.282 --> 19:09.967
I'm tired of running in circles.

19:10.034 --> 19:12.552
Why don't we get it like five more times?

19:12.619 --> 19:14.537
I'm tired of running in circles.

19:14.538 --> 19:16.747
I'm tired of running in circles.

19:16.748 --> 19:18.958
I'm tired of running in circles.

19:18.959 --> 19:21.169
I'm tired of running in circles.

19:21.170 --> 19:23.213
I'm tired of running in circles.

19:23.214 --> 19:25.483
Let's get it ten more times.

19:30.262 --> 19:32.096
- Ta-da!
- We did it.

19:32.097 --> 19:34.473
- What now?
- We die, have our guts ripped out

19:34.474 --> 19:37.495
through our noses,
and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

19:37.561 --> 19:39.645
Hey, BoJack,
can I talk to you for a minute?

19:39.646 --> 19:41.873
Ooh...

19:41.940 --> 19:43.083
Alone, please?

19:43.150 --> 19:45.961
Oh...

19:46.028 --> 19:48.297
So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.

19:48.322 --> 19:49.756
- Right now. You and me.
- What?

19:49.823 --> 19:52.843
I booked us a room for the weekend.
Pack your bags, let's go.

19:52.910 --> 19:54.094
Where? Why?

19:54.161 --> 19:55.453
Less asking, more basking.

19:55.454 --> 19:57.663
In the sun, that is. Santa Barbara.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.375
- I'm not really in the mood for...
- I think some time away

20:00.376 --> 20:02.960
could be really good for us, as a couple.

20:02.961 --> 20:03.937
Oh.

20:04.004 --> 20:06.648
I know you've been really bummed out
about the movie,

20:06.757 --> 20:10.652
but I don't think moping around the house
with Diane all day is healthy.

20:10.719 --> 20:12.387
All I've ever wanted
was to be in this movie,

20:12.388 --> 20:14.513
and you just want me
to put on a happy face...

20:14.514 --> 20:18.118
Yes. There are lots of people
who don't like their jobs.

20:18.185 --> 20:20.395
Doesn't mean
they have to bring it home with...

20:20.396 --> 20:24.065
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- What is that supposed to mean?

20:24.066 --> 20:26.359
Well, come on.
You're a network executive.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.128
You don't give a shit about work.

20:28.487 --> 20:30.964
I actually have a lot of pride
in what I do.

20:31.031 --> 20:32.531
What? You have a lot of pride?

20:32.532 --> 20:35.076
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

20:35.077 --> 20:37.787
hoping some of the garbage
stinks less than the rest

20:37.788 --> 20:41.082
so you can quietly renew that garbage
and keep failing sideways

20:41.083 --> 20:43.793
until you retire
to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

20:43.794 --> 20:45.628
in Beverly Garbage
and spend the rest of your life

20:45.629 --> 20:49.900
- watching your former assistant's garbage.
- I don't know where this is coming from.

20:49.925 --> 20:52.969
Every good thing
that ever happened to you happened

20:52.970 --> 20:55.155
because of network executives like me.

20:55.222 --> 20:58.283
That show you spend all day watching,
your house, your career...

20:58.350 --> 21:01.978
Great house, great career, great life!
Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

21:01.979 --> 21:03.497
- You don't know...
- I don't?

21:03.563 --> 21:07.334
My life was ruined
by a network executive like you.

21:07.859 --> 21:11.338
Well, I'm sorry
that things have been so hard for you,

21:11.405 --> 21:15.283
but that doesn't give you the right to be
shitty to me. I can't be around someone

21:15.284 --> 21:18.220
who's just fueled
by bitterness and negativity.

21:18.829 --> 21:20.805
Well then, what are you doing here?

21:21.706 --> 21:23.434
What happened, BoJack?

21:24.042 --> 21:26.061
Same thing that always happens.

21:26.128 --> 21:29.106
You didn't know me.
Then you fell in love with me.

21:29.714 --> 21:31.191
And now you know me.

21:33.093 --> 21:37.514
You know, it's funny. When you look
at someone through rose-colored glasses,

21:37.515 --> 21:40.409
all the red flags just look like flags.

21:46.106 --> 21:49.400
- So, Wanda's moving out.
- Oh, shit. Because of me?

21:49.401 --> 21:51.068
No. Because of me.

21:51.069 --> 21:54.572
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode
of Horsin' Around?

21:54.573 --> 21:58.159
Where Olivia does the school project
where she pretends an egg is a baby.

21:58.160 --> 22:01.138
Spoiler alert:
Ethan needs to make an omelet.

22:01.497 --> 22:03.140
Why won't you go home?

22:03.457 --> 22:06.017
I should. I know I should.

22:06.418 --> 22:09.086
I wish I could just go home right now
and crawl into bed

22:09.087 --> 22:12.899
and not have to talk about anything
or explain anything.

22:13.008 --> 22:15.968
He would just say, "How was your day?"
And then he would say,

22:15.969 --> 22:19.055
"Hey, did you know the monorail
was invented by George Monorail?"

22:19.056 --> 22:21.182
And I would say,
"I don't think that's true."

22:21.183 --> 22:24.768
And he would say, "Well, if he didn't
invent it, he certainly perfected it."

22:24.769 --> 22:27.747
And I wouldn't have to say,
"I'm sorry I left.

22:28.023 --> 22:29.899
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

22:29.900 --> 22:33.753
I'm sorry I'm not the person
I thought I was."

22:34.029 --> 22:36.614
I would just say, "My day was good."

22:36.615 --> 22:39.259
And he would say, "I love you."

22:40.660 --> 22:43.681
The longer you keep lying to him,
the harder it's gonna get.

22:44.248 --> 22:45.873
Can I ask you something?

22:45.874 --> 22:49.460
That play in New York,
would that really have made you happy?

22:49.461 --> 22:52.547
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

22:52.548 --> 22:54.107
And if Kelsey didn't get fired,

22:54.132 --> 22:56.467
and you got to make the movie
you wanted to make,

22:56.468 --> 22:58.153
would that have made you happy?

22:58.220 --> 22:59.530
For a little bit.

22:59.763 --> 23:00.864
But then...

23:01.432 --> 23:02.574
Probably...

23:04.101 --> 23:05.619
So, what does it matter?

23:05.977 --> 23:08.646
But there has to be more.

23:08.647 --> 23:12.834
Well, when's the last time
you were actually happy?

23:23.828 --> 23:27.540
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

23:27.541 --> 23:28.767
Microchip.

23:30.502 --> 23:31.478
Ah.

23:43.098 --> 23:44.199
Oh.

23:48.270 --> 23:49.270
Todd!

23:50.814 --> 23:53.208
Yeah.

23:56.361 --> 23:57.796
Oh.

23:58.238 --> 23:59.964
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

24:00.031 --> 24:01.759
Hey. How are you?

24:01.825 --> 24:03.802
I can't do this anymore.

24:03.868 --> 24:05.970
You can't do what anymore?

24:06.037 --> 24:08.706
I can't talk to you on the phone
all the time.

24:08.707 --> 24:10.016
It's too hard.

24:10.083 --> 24:11.935
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

24:12.002 --> 24:15.129
I think maybe we should stop
calling each other, for a little bit.

24:15.130 --> 24:18.358
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

24:18.383 --> 24:21.385
But listen, I love you. Okay?

24:21.386 --> 24:22.654
Mr. Peanutbutter?

24:23.013 --> 24:25.931
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.158
I love you, Diane.

24:28.435 --> 24:30.269
- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.

24:30.270 --> 24:33.164
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?

25:28.870 --> 25:32.056
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

25:33.305 --> 25:39.176
