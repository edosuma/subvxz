00:00.360 --> 00:01.760
   Previously on St Elsewhere -

00:01.760 --> 00:04.120
Sometimes Ehrlich doesn't
    have any sense.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.600
Drop him from my rotation.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.640
&lt; My sister, Morena.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.600
She doesn't speak much English.
Just got here from El Salvador.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.120
The board has adopted
only two of the proposals,

00:13.120 --> 00:14.840
and haven't put either
      into action.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.920
       I'm transferring you to OBGYN.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.400
I'll apologise immediately.
This will never happen again.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.080
I'll apologise immediately.
This will never happen again.
    You start tomorrow morning.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.240
You drag your personal problems
 in here -

00:24.240 --> 00:26.760
one rotten marriage
after another,

00:26.760 --> 00:30.760
and those bratty kids
of yours... Ow!

02:14.520 --> 02:15.400
You want a drink?

02:15.400 --> 02:19.400
You want a drink?
No, thanks! Go on!

02:27.840 --> 02:30.520
           Bob... Bob...

02:30.520 --> 02:31.640
Beat it, Ehrlich.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.680
        This is important.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.320
I'm the last guy you wanna talk to.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.600
I stepped over the line
on the Boynton case,

02:36.600 --> 02:38.280
 scared a patient out of surgery,

02:38.280 --> 02:41.480
but did you have to tell Craig
to kick me out of the department?

02:41.480 --> 02:45.280
That was his idea.
I wanted to tear your head off.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.640
 Look, medicine's a judgment call.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.160
    I tried using my judgment.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.000
Yeah, that was your first mistake.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.680
 I'm sorry, OK? I'll do anything.

02:52.680 --> 02:56.440
I'll never take another plastics
rotation, I'll handle the burn ward.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.080
 Just get me back in the surgery.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.240
I gave you more chances
     than you deserve.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.840
Got sandbagged for it.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.280
You don't understand, OK?
You wanna hate me, that's just fine,

03:05.280 --> 03:08.200
but I've got to prove myself
to Craig otherwise he'll drop me

03:08.200 --> 03:10.960
from the residency programme.
Then where would I be?

03:10.960 --> 03:14.960
Ehrlich, I don't care if you end up
in a taxidermy shop stuffing tuna.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.480
     Which brings us to OBGYN.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.960
Craig transferred me there so I
could learn interpersonal skills.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.840
Obviously I need work in that area.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.680
Dealing with women
isn't my long suit, you know?

03:24.680 --> 03:28.680
Kicked out of surgery, out of OBGYN,
next stop's the street corner.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.800
You know something? I don't give
a rat's can about your problems.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.280
You're one of those
high-school lightweights

03:35.280 --> 03:37.360
who ran to teacher
              when things got rough.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.320
What? This is because
I was lousy at dodgeball?!

03:40.320 --> 03:44.320
Stay out of my way.

03:48.440 --> 03:52.440
Come on, son. Finish up, there.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.400
Buenas dias, Morena. &gt;

03:56.400 --> 03:57.440
Hello.

03:57.440 --> 03:57.880
Hi, Dad.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.280
Hi, Dad.
&lt; Hi.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.080
I called a taxi for you.
They'll pick you up in an hour.

04:02.080 --> 04:06.080
An hour? I've only got
        a million things left to do.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.520
OK. Come on, son. Time to get
you to school. Get your coat.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.080
Tommy stay Morena.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.079
&lt; No, you're going to school.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.160
Morena, thanks for doing my laundry.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.200
Yes.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.200
You know, she's only been here
      a week and already she knows

04:23.200 --> 04:25.680
how to run the house.
I really like her.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.240
She makes the strongest coffee
in the world.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.240
Tommy hasn't gotten along with
anyone this well since Mrs Catalano.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.360
He's gonna be late.

04:33.360 --> 04:37.120
I'll get him.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.800
Oh, Dad? I'm gonna need
some more money for school.

04:40.800 --> 04:44.800
I just sent you a cheque last week.

05:18.280 --> 05:22.280
Tommy! Tommy, come here!

05:23.720 --> 05:26.880
  Morena, if the plumber calls...

05:26.880 --> 05:28.960
Plumber?

05:28.960 --> 05:30.160
                          Never mind.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.160
Dad! Come up here, quick! &gt;

05:35.280 --> 05:36.920
Tommy, come here!

05:36.920 --> 05:40.920
&lt; Tommy!

05:40.960 --> 05:42.280
              Lizzie?

05:42.280 --> 05:45.320
Dad, he climbed out! &gt;

05:45.320 --> 05:47.160
    Tommy!

05:47.160 --> 05:50.400
&lt; Tommy!

05:50.400 --> 05:53.760
         Tommy, come here!

05:53.760 --> 05:55.560
Thomas!

05:55.560 --> 05:56.480
            Come here.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.320
            Come here.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

05:59.320 --> 06:03.320
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

06:05.920 --> 06:08.320
&lt; Tommy, come here!

06:08.320 --> 06:09.080
Cuidado!

06:09.080 --> 06:10.560
Cuidado!
&lt; Tommy!

06:10.560 --> 06:14.560
Come here!

06:25.400 --> 06:26.040
You OK, Dad?

06:26.040 --> 06:30.040
You OK, Dad?
               Yeah.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.160
      No. No, I'm sorry, sir.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.200
I do not see that name on
the admitting list. I'm sorry.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.000
Well, are you sure
you brought your wife here?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.120
Well, our hospital
is made out of brick.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.920
What did the place you took
your wife look like?

06:45.920 --> 06:48.400
 Oh, no, no. That's St Cecilia's.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.040
St Cecilia's has a fountain
outside. What?

06:51.040 --> 06:53.560
I know. Yeah, I'm sure
it's a very good hospital.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.760
          OK, no problem.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.400
Helen, will you have someone
   clean up the graffiti

06:58.400 --> 06:59.920
in the men's room right away?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.080
                       That bad, huh?

07:01.080 --> 07:04.560
I don't think Mrs Auschlander
will appreciate being phoned

07:04.560 --> 07:07.320
for a good time.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.920
                          Oh, Daniel?

07:08.920 --> 07:11.400
I tried putting a patient
on the CT scanner.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.400
They said you'd reserved the machine.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.520
You look tired.

07:14.520 --> 07:18.520
Yeah, well, the baby's been
sounding readily at 1am, 3am, 4:30...

07:18.960 --> 07:20.720
    What's going on with the scanner?

07:20.720 --> 07:24.680
Boston Museum is X-raying
one of its Egyptian mummies.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.880
The city offered use of the
CAT scanners of all its hospitals.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.520
The museum wants to examine
its entire collection of mummies,

07:31.520 --> 07:33.960
utilising the new technology.
It's our turn.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.760
And how long are these
grave-robbers gonna tie us up?

07:36.760 --> 07:39.840
I've given them short periods
of time over the next two days.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.760
You can get in there
this afternoon.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.240
Well, I'd better.
Hospitals are supposed to be

07:44.240 --> 07:47.880
        for the living, not the dead.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.000
            Hiya, Lucy.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.640
Bobby. Hey, thanks.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.840
Whatever you did to my engine
yesterday, it's running great.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.800
I blew the moisture
out of your coil.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.920
The car has one, too?

07:57.920 --> 07:58.960
                                 Mmm.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.960
If you're trying to cop
another feel, I'll just stand here

08:01.960 --> 08:04.040
instead of being chased around.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.080
Would it be a normal day if
I didn't come by for a Long John?

08:07.080 --> 08:09.720
Oh, by this point,
I'd probably feel slighted.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.240
How'd it go last night, the date?
You get lucky?

08:12.240 --> 08:14.520
He probably thought so.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.680
Hmm.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.560
Nothing for the history books, huh?

08:17.560 --> 08:20.840
Carson's monologue lasted longer.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.560
I thought you were one of those women
who like to go for the distance.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.600
The first boyfriend was a harrier,
  quick as a bunny.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.680
Gonna give this guy the heave-ho?

08:28.680 --> 08:30.120
Gonna give this guy the heave-ho?
I wasn't planning on it,

08:30.120 --> 08:34.120
until he made the comment that
I might consider breast implants.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.919
Look fine to me.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.039
I guess he doesn't have
     your good taste.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.559
Well, if you want another
professional peak under the hood,

08:41.559 --> 08:43.280
   I'll be glad to size you up.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.280
Have to show me yours
first, Caldwell!

08:49.320 --> 08:51.920
You two are really disgusting.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.920
Helen, it's been a pleasure
ignoring each other.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.840
Let's keep it up.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.440
  How could Craig do this to me?

09:00.440 --> 09:02.240
Be glad you're still working here.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.480
I'd rather be transferred
to accounting.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.640
OBGYN's no picnic for me, either.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.360
This rotation went south
            when Roxanne did.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.600
You're lucky, you get along
with women.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.200
What are you so afraid of?

09:13.200 --> 09:15.600
Women find me rude,
vulgar, insensitive.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.800
They make me crazy. I've dreamed
of touching them all my life.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.680
They excite me. When I get excited,
I say stupid things.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.280
Because you love women,
they think you hate them?

09:25.280 --> 09:27.800
I'm the pig poster child.
How do you deal with it?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.600
Well, you treat them like people.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.600
Treat them like people, right.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.880
Molly...

09:35.880 --> 09:38.040
This is Dr Ehrlich.
I'm going off-shift.

09:38.040 --> 09:42.040
He'll be handling your delivery.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.880
      I can't do it. Did you see her?

09:47.880 --> 09:50.280
I can't be detached
around that woman's body.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.520
Man's body, fine. I see them
at the Y all the time. But...

09:53.520 --> 09:54.840
Victor, you're a doctor.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.000
Surgeon. Then we're talking,
anaesthetised, open wounds.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.760
But heaving breasts
and the uro-genital tract...

10:00.760 --> 10:02.360
          Conscious women terrify me!

10:02.360 --> 10:04.520
Molly is the only woman
on the ward so far.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.320
Her water broke an hour ago.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.680
Maybe she'll deliver
after your shift ends.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.520
   That's seven hours from now.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.320
   That's seven hours from now.
She's three centimetres dilated.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.440
All I've got to do
is avoid her till then?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.080
That's one way of looking at it.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.720
OK, great.
I'll just play hide and seek

10:17.720 --> 10:21.720
until I can figure a way out.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.800
Have supply bring down
all the shampoo they've got.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.720
At least we can give these people
a cure for lice.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.640
Wayne! Thank God.
We need you around here.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.600
Westphall assigned me to the morgue
for a couple of days.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.960
             What are you doing here?

10:37.960 --> 10:41.600
Lonely. It seems like when I work
up here in ER, everybody dies.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.160
Down there, no customers.  Thought
I'd see what the problem was.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.800
Well, we had a pretty big
car accident a little while back,

10:48.800 --> 10:52.640
but unfortunately,
I think they're all gonna make it.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.560
Wayne? Dudley Bowman, remember me?

10:55.560 --> 10:58.680
I helped you move into that
pasty guy's apartment last year?

10:58.680 --> 11:00.520
Ehrlich? Right!

11:00.520 --> 11:03.000
You were the only one
who could drive the truck.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.720
Slept at our place
            for four days. Straight.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.440
How you doing?

11:07.440 --> 11:09.160
Good. Tired.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.720
Nobody's getting any sleep with
the cops running around. You've got

11:12.720 --> 11:16.600
to keep moving constantly otherwise
you'll wind up in the City Shelter.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.320
Nobody wants to live with bums.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.840
Good point.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.320
(COUGHS)

11:22.320 --> 11:25.640
That hack sounds bad.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.360
Ran into a rotten stream. Seems like
all the butts I find are unfiltered.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.400
Anyone examine you?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.040
I've been waiting.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.440
I've been waiting.
Why don't I take a look?

11:33.440 --> 11:35.040
It's not worth it, Wayne.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.440
Well, I've nothing to do
            anyway. Follow me.

11:38.440 --> 11:42.040
In that case, how about
letting me buy you breakfast after?

11:42.040 --> 11:43.640
You got the money?

11:43.640 --> 11:47.640
No, it just seemed like
a polite thing to say.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.240
Morena, you can use the dishwasher.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.520
Dishwasher?

12:02.520 --> 12:05.880
Dishwasher.
You don't scrub, remember?

12:05.880 --> 12:08.240
Just like I showed you before.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.880
Glasses here,

12:09.880 --> 12:11.120
dishes here. OK?

12:11.120 --> 12:13.560
CAR HORN BEEPS

12:13.560 --> 12:17.560
Oh, there's my taxi.
Oh, shoot! My backpack.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.320
No clean good.

12:20.320 --> 12:24.320
(GASPS WITH PAIN)

12:24.760 --> 12:28.080
  Adios, Morena! See you at Noel.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.080
   Morena? What's wrong? Morena?

12:32.840 --> 12:34.880
'Dr James Cooper, admitting.'

12:34.880 --> 12:38.880
'Dr James Cooper, admitting.'

12:40.320 --> 12:42.880
&lt; All right,
let's move it over here.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.440
What's the problem?

12:44.440 --> 12:46.920
(MUMBLES DRUNKENLY)

12:46.920 --> 12:47.960
       Name?

12:47.960 --> 12:49.960
Michael Dukakis.

12:49.960 --> 12:50.400
Occupation?

12:50.400 --> 12:51.840
Occupation?
Governor.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.160
Governor of what?

12:53.160 --> 12:55.200
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.360
Baloney, that's... What's his name?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.440
I'm what's his name!

13:00.440 --> 13:04.440
Have a seat.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.200
Seven-car demolition derby on
the Mass Pike. This guy's stable.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.400
More wagons behind me.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.000
Ward's full, we'll have
to triage in the hallway.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Clear the walk-ins out of the
ward, get whoever's on call.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.360
Clear the people in the hall.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.360
Elliot? Let's move him over.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.040
You giving something away?

13:23.040 --> 13:24.440
Yeah, free space.

13:24.440 --> 13:28.000
The city's sweeping up bums and
putting them in municipal shelters.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.560
They're all hiding out here.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.000
I'll get the next one!

13:31.000 --> 13:32.240
You don't look so bad.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.960
Minor lacerations,
possible broken clavicle.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.560
Cuts and a broken collarbone.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.440
Massive blood loss and head trauma.

13:38.440 --> 13:42.440
  She's first. This one can wait.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.520
   And this one is beyond help.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.200
Your blood pressure is low
and you're running a fever.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.640
I always get colds
this time of year.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.880
I just came in to St Eligius
avoid the cherry tops.

13:56.880 --> 13:57.920
           You coughing up any blood?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.720
           You coughing up any blood?
Yeah, just a speck or two.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.240
       I'd like to get a chest X-ray.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.440
I'd rather take a nap.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.840
           Well, you can sleep later.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.160
Shh!

14:05.160 --> 14:07.320
Listen to that.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.240
               I don't hear anything.

14:08.240 --> 14:12.080
               I don't hear anything.
I know. Silence.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.840
Do you have any idea
how noisy the world is?

14:14.840 --> 14:18.840
Traffic, sirens, construction,
helicopters, mass transit...

14:20.880 --> 14:23.760
It's a high-decibel
merry-go-round out there.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.040
Sometimes it's like...

14:26.040 --> 14:29.400
Well, it gets in your head,
like bees are inside.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.760
(COUGHS)

14:32.760 --> 14:35.000
Could I brush my teeth?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.640
                                Sure.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.880
I thought bums sleep
through everything?

14:38.880 --> 14:42.080
Yeah, but that ain't sleep,
it's just not moving.

14:42.080 --> 14:46.080
You've got your radar going
constantly, looking for cops

14:46.480 --> 14:50.480
or thieves or some idiot driving
a garbage truck over your legs.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Real sleep, the REM model,
it's only a dream.

14:55.400 --> 14:59.400
                                What?

14:59.760 --> 15:02.440
Forget it.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.920
          Let's get off to Radiology.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.400
When you swore as a kid,
did your mom used to wash

15:06.400 --> 15:10.240
      your mouth out with toothpaste?

15:10.240 --> 15:13.280
          Cardiac needle.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.080
"Oh, for crying out loud, Ehrlich!

15:15.080 --> 15:17.560
"We're not trussing
a Christmas turkey here.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.400
"My granddaughter
ties a better purse string!"

15:20.400 --> 15:22.960
             Yes, sir.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.320
Victor?

15:24.320 --> 15:27.000
What are you doing?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.440
Reminiscing about the good old days.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.440
Aren't you supposed to be in OBGYN?

15:31.440 --> 15:34.560
It's a slow day, thank Yahweh.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.480
You know, all I ever wanted
to be was a surgeon.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.960
Did exercises to strengthen my hands,

15:41.960 --> 15:45.960
practised tying knots in the dark,
I memorised every move Dr Craig made.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.360
I don't have an interest in any
other field. Surgery's my life.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.400
So? &gt;

15:50.400 --> 15:53.360
Look at me now. Demoted
to obstetrics and gynaecology.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.360
That's how I felt when I told
Dr Westphall about my medical degree

15:58.120 --> 15:59.800
and he placed me in the pharmacy.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.160
Hold the phone, I'm not a bozo!

16:02.160 --> 16:06.160
What I mean is you can learn,
       no matter where you are.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.480
Yeah. Don't worry,
I've got it all figured out.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.800
Accepting who you are?

16:10.800 --> 16:13.680
No, you see, I spend a week
in the infertility clinic,

16:13.680 --> 16:16.680
mostly counselling.
Then I move right into GYN Oncology,

16:16.680 --> 16:20.400
older women, nothing at stake there.
Another week by the boards.

16:20.400 --> 16:24.400
Meanwhile, I find a medical student,
express an interest in teaching him.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.920
Any hands-on work,
this guy handles. Perfect!

16:26.920 --> 16:28.080
What are you talking about?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.560
What are you talking about?
You see, if this plan works,

16:29.560 --> 16:31.200
I could be the first resident

16:31.200 --> 16:35.120
to go through OBGYN rotation without
ever touching a nubile young woman.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.880
You're sick, Victor.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.880
Fantastic, Boomer. If all else fails,
I get sick and skip the whole thing!

16:43.880 --> 16:47.880
             Ah, yeah!

16:48.320 --> 16:52.000
I didn't think the board would fund
your nutrition classes so quickly.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.720
What do you expect?
Donald whined, bitched,

16:54.720 --> 16:56.960
caught malaria,
     fell down the stairs...

16:56.960 --> 17:00.080
I mean, the board was probably
afraid he'd commit hari-kari

17:00.080 --> 17:01.840
unless they tossed him a bone.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.000
This will give us leverage to fight
for more of your ideas.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.760
I hope so. We mailed some flyers
    to the local clinics,

17:07.760 --> 17:10.880
the Public Radio is putting us
      into their community notices

17:10.880 --> 17:14.319
and WYN is coming by this evening
to cover the first class tonight.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.640
I finally feel
        I'm accomplishing something.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.640
This looks like the diet Whiley
put me on for liver cancer.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.640
What we'll be doing is teaching
people to feed their families

17:23.880 --> 17:27.359
on a low budget, and at the same
time maintain nutritional quality.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.680
Basic food, simple preparation.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.880
Let's hope our dieticians
    can make it taste better

17:32.880 --> 17:34.320
than their usual slop.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.800
Donald? ER just called.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.160
Lizzie's down there
with your housekeeper.

17:38.160 --> 17:38.720
What happened?

17:38.720 --> 17:40.000
What happened?
They didn't say.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.920
Excuse.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.560
Well, the governor ought to declare
that man's life a disaster area.

17:47.560 --> 17:51.480
You should start taking better care
of yourself, Dudley. No more food out

17:51.480 --> 17:55.480
of garbage cans, no more sleeping in
car parks, sucking up exhaust fumes.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.520
                  You'll live longer.

17:57.520 --> 17:57.960
Than what?

17:57.960 --> 17:59.120
Than what?
                             Than 30.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.640
I was lucky to make 12.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.400
I got sent a punch by a line drive
in the Little League.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.840
I was in the Little League!
Catcher, only guy with a cup.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.240
Always short.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.320
Not really, 4 foot 10,
that's average size.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.360
No, I played short stock.
I was quick.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.440
Rico Petricelli...

18:15.440 --> 18:17.280
                        A Bo-Sox man!

18:17.280 --> 18:18.560
I grew up in Framingham.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.240
             Ever visit your parents?

18:20.240 --> 18:23.560
Nah. Besides baseball,
the thing I remember most

18:23.560 --> 18:25.360
about growing up was Junior High.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.560
When the hormones
kick into overdrive?

18:27.560 --> 18:31.480
Served on the class council,
I took Stacey Clarke

18:31.480 --> 18:35.120
to the 9th grade prom,
bisected frogs...

18:35.120 --> 18:36.760
          Go to college?

18:36.760 --> 18:38.160
Hated freshman year.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.280
           Yeah, me too.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.200
Yeah, but I quit.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.080
              Hello?

18:44.080 --> 18:48.080
        Where is everybody?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.280
Look how clear that is! &gt;

18:59.280 --> 19:03.280
It's incredible. &gt;

19:03.320 --> 19:04.520
Wayne, hi!

19:04.520 --> 19:07.640
                Hi.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.000
Friend of yours?

19:09.000 --> 19:12.800
In a way.
Dudley - Mona, my girlfriend.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.680
Hi. Coming in
for a look at Mr Mummy?

19:15.680 --> 19:19.600
No, looking for an X-ray technician.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.520
Imhotep.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.040
           You know him?

19:23.040 --> 19:25.720
I used to hang out in the museum
    when it was cold out.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.200
The Egyptian Room was my favourite.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.080
It had the best heat in the place.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.600
He was a Pharaoh.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.720
Really?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.560
He's over 3,000 years old.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.360
See what happens
when you take care of yourself?

19:38.360 --> 19:41.520
The guy, he ruled an empire,

19:41.520 --> 19:45.480
and 3,000 years later,
people still remember him.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.200
             So what?

19:48.200 --> 19:52.200
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be somebody, you know?

19:52.600 --> 19:55.680
John F Kennedy, discover a planet,

19:55.680 --> 19:58.000
be the centre
             of no little attention.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.960
          What happened?

19:59.960 --> 20:03.640
Like one of those fly balls
         that gets lost in the sun,

20:03.640 --> 20:06.760
I couldn't flip the shades down.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.720
Peaked in Junior High.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.920
She doesn't speak English very well.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.040
What happened?

20:13.040 --> 20:15.680
Something with Morena's back.
She couldn't move.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.720
We need someone to speak Spanish.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.800
We need someone to speak Spanish.
All right, get Jack Morrison paged.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.160
He's fluent in Spanish.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.640
Hey, Dad, my cab's waiting outside.
I should get to the airport.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.040
          I wish I could stay, but...

20:25.040 --> 20:27.080
All right, sweetheart. We'll manage.

20:27.080 --> 20:27.520
                       Thanks.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.760
                       Thanks.
Bye.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.680
Dad'll take care of you.
Esta bien!

20:31.680 --> 20:34.240
                      Vaya con dios!

20:34.240 --> 20:37.320
Your back...hurts?

20:37.320 --> 20:40.960
Morena...

20:40.960 --> 20:42.280
Ai-i-i!

20:42.280 --> 20:46.280
Her spine has muscle spasm.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.960
No CVA tenderness.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.960
All right, it'll be all right.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.080
                     You call for me?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.400
Hiya, sweetheart.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.520
I've just debrided an ulcer
on Mr Hildreth's heel.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.040
Wanna help me bandage?

21:02.040 --> 21:04.280
                             Mmm-hmm.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.440
Silk gauze?

21:07.440 --> 21:10.240
I forgot to tell you
how sexy you look today, Luce.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.200
                Don't worry about it.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.400
You smell good, too.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.920
Wrap?

21:16.920 --> 21:20.320
Nice having a good-looking young
thing take care of you, ain't it?

21:20.320 --> 21:23.520
Lucy told me she's thinking
about getting breast implants

21:23.520 --> 21:27.520
to please her boyfriend.
What do you think about that?

21:27.640 --> 21:29.600
Look okey-dokey to me!

21:29.600 --> 21:32.560
Why, thank you, Mr Hildreth.
I'll sleep better now(!)

21:32.560 --> 21:35.040
Yeah, that's what I told her.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.200
She's well shaped, firm.
Makes the most of what she's got.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.320
                             OK, Bob.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.960
Luce's my favourite
around here. Unfortunately,

21:42.960 --> 21:46.440
she won't have anything to do with
me, but I hear that she's hot

21:46.440 --> 21:49.680
for older men who need
to get nursed back to health.

21:49.680 --> 21:53.680
                        Cool it, Bob!

21:54.280 --> 21:56.880
Wanna move him around
a little bit once in a while,

21:56.880 --> 21:59.760
make sure he doesn't get
any more bed sores?

21:59.760 --> 22:03.760
Lie back, enjoy, Mr Hildreth.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.520
Thanks, honey.

22:11.520 --> 22:15.520
Come around any time
to fluff up the pillows!

He apologises, and that's it?

33:48.240 --> 33:52.240
No. Please step outside.

33:54.440 --> 33:58.440
OK, so this is my formal reprimand.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.840
Don't worry, Dr Auschlander,
I will stay away from Lucy.

34:01.840 --> 34:02.880
Wait a minute. &gt;

34:02.880 --> 34:05.360
What have you to say
   in answer to these charges?

34:05.360 --> 34:07.360
I was playing.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.199
Not according to Lucy.

34:09.199 --> 34:12.080
Look, I don't
understand what happened.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.480
Lucy and I fool around all the time,

34:14.480 --> 34:17.199
and this time all of a sudden,
she goes nuts! It was a joke.

34:17.199 --> 34:21.080
I thought you were
          a caring, capable surgeon.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.600
You handled your patients with
sensitivity and compassion.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.760
St Eligius needs doctors like you.

34:26.760 --> 34:30.639
Now I find out you're a
brassiere-snapping fraternity boy.

34:30.639 --> 34:34.159
One more incident like this and
you're through, do you understand?

34:34.159 --> 34:36.159
Yes, sir.

34:36.159 --> 34:39.320
I will apologised to Lucy again.

34:39.320 --> 34:43.320
Be glad she didn't
slap you with a lawsuit.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.320
The poor woman
was tortured by doctors.

34:57.320 --> 35:00.680
How can somebody abuse their
medical responsibility like that?

35:00.680 --> 35:02.560
Speaking of which, where's Victor?

35:02.560 --> 35:03.640
      He's helping a patient.

35:03.640 --> 35:06.800
      He's helping a patient.
Must have found somebody who
likes being called Doll Cakes.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.760
    What has got you all crazy?

35:08.760 --> 35:12.760
Caldwell. Which reminds me, Phil,
you interrupt me all the time.

35:13.120 --> 35:16.320
As if because I'm a woman, what I
have to say couldn't possibly

35:16.320 --> 35:18.200
be as important
            as what you have to say.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.240
Uh-huh.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.400
Wayne, what's wrong?

35:20.400 --> 35:23.280
Remember that bum down in the ER?

35:23.280 --> 35:25.280
Which one?
There was a hundred of 'em.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.280
Dudley, the one who died.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.680
Dudley, the one who died.
                  Yeah, that guy, so?

35:28.680 --> 35:31.240
Let's get started.
Dr Wade, your case, please.

35:31.240 --> 35:34.200
April Anderson, 35-year-old
white female, four weeks.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.040
Post op for a bleeding ulcer,
presented with jaundice

35:37.040 --> 35:41.040
 and mild constitutional symptoms.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.080
Doctor?

35:43.080 --> 35:46.320
I don't know what happened. Someone
must have taken her for tests.

35:46.320 --> 35:50.120
Next time you  present a case, be
sure you know where your patient is.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.600
She can't help it if
someone else screwed up.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.840
Excuses. That's all I
get from you people.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.960
It's always someone
else's fault.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.600
The people who work in the lab,
the ward clerks, complaints that

36:00.600 --> 36:02.880
you don't have enough time.
I'm tired of it.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.400
I told you to think about
    where you're going to do

36:05.400 --> 36:08.400
community services. Two of you
came forth. The rest of you

36:08.400 --> 36:10.760
waited for the
board to turn down that project.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.880
Well, they didn't. So I'm
 going to assign each one of you.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.600
Maybe nobody stepped forward
cos were already doing enough.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.640
Maybe nobody stepped forward
cos were already doing enough.
             Wayne...

36:17.640 --> 36:20.800
You don't think we care
about the people we deal with?

36:20.800 --> 36:22.440
Well, we do.

36:22.440 --> 36:26.120
We care, and they die anyway.
You want us to give more
  to the community,

36:26.120 --> 36:28.120
when the community doesn't care?

36:28.120 --> 36:31.400
Medicine stinks
because society stinks.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.160
We just apply band-aids
for a lousy world.

36:34.160 --> 36:38.160
So I'm not gonna listen to any
lectures about responsibility.

36:38.720 --> 36:39.680
           I'll get him.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.640
           I'll get him.
Let him go.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.280
He's upset about...

36:43.280 --> 36:45.320
I don't care.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.840
Dr Axelrod, you're next.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.080
(MOANS, BREATHES HEAVILY)

36:49.080 --> 36:51.880
          Push. That's it, bear down.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.680
(STRAINS)

36:53.680 --> 36:57.000
I changed my mind, I can't take
the pain. I want a spinal. Please!

36:57.000 --> 36:59.360
You're too far along.
You can do it.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.760
No, I can't!

37:00.760 --> 37:02.720
  Put your legs back into position. &gt;

37:02.720 --> 37:04.080
I'm too tired.

37:04.080 --> 37:07.600
   You can't deliver like that!

37:07.600 --> 37:10.600
I can't make it. I can't make it.

37:10.600 --> 37:14.360
Molly, listen to me. You'll make it.
You're strong. We've come this far.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.360
We'll do it together.
You're gonna have this baby
right now, OK? Push, come on.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.480
                     That's it. Push.

37:21.480 --> 37:25.480
Real hard. OK! Here's the head.
Lidocaine.

37:31.080 --> 37:35.080
        OK. I'm doing the episiotomy.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.320
OK, big push now.
Push again, real hard.

37:39.320 --> 37:43.240
     Bear down! Got the head.

37:43.240 --> 37:44.360
                            Big push!

37:44.360 --> 37:46.560
         Hey! It's a boy!

37:46.560 --> 37:50.120
                 It's a boy! (LAUGHS)

37:50.120 --> 37:53.160
BABY CRIES

37:53.160 --> 37:57.160
            Yeah, give me the clamps.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.240
You did great.

37:59.240 --> 38:03.200
                   OK. He's handsome.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.040
              He's a handsome fellow.

38:05.040 --> 38:09.040
Oh!

38:10.480 --> 38:12.200
You know what I'm gonna name him?

38:12.200 --> 38:13.560
                              Victor?

38:13.560 --> 38:17.560
No. Edward, after his grandfather.
Come here, Dr Ehrlich.

38:20.920 --> 38:24.920
               Yeah?

38:28.480 --> 38:29.680
Thank you.

38:29.680 --> 38:33.680
OK.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.560
Lucy, I'm sorry.
What I did was wrong.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.200
Well, evidently that's
enough for everybody.

38:47.200 --> 38:51.200
You say you're sorry, and
the problem never happened.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.880
I don't know what's going on
with me any more.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.040
Oh, shove it, Dr Caldwell.

38:56.040 --> 38:56.760
                              Lucy...

38:56.760 --> 38:59.200
                              Lucy...
Don't you ever touch me again.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.240
I've been a mess
since that girl cut me.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.320
Well, I'm beginning to think
that maybe she had a reason.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.360
Well, I'm beginning to think
that maybe she had a reason.
                       Maybe she did.

39:05.360 --> 39:08.640
Maybe I deserved it for
picking her up, I don't know.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.520
     My whole life is coming unglued.

39:10.520 --> 39:13.320
I feel like I'm on some
weird autopilot. I got

39:13.320 --> 39:16.640
to hide behind this butcher job
feeling like a picture someone

39:16.640 --> 39:17.640
          slashed and made worthless.

39:17.640 --> 39:20.240
          slashed and made worthless.
I'm sorry about your problems,

39:20.240 --> 39:24.240
but they're not my fault.

39:29.840 --> 39:33.320
                               Wayne.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.240
What are you doing down here?

39:35.240 --> 39:37.960
Jackie told me about
what happened on rounds.

39:37.960 --> 39:41.480
                          Are you OK?

39:41.480 --> 39:43.760
I hate this job.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.560
                       No, you don't.

39:45.560 --> 39:48.680
I'd rather be running
Wayne's Bait And Tackle.

39:48.680 --> 39:52.680
You're only responsible
for the death of a few fish.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.120
          Dudley was a real nice guy.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.960
                           I'm sorry.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.160
We're the only ones who are sorry.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.960
Nobody even knows he's dead.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.920
DOOR OPENS

40:04.920 --> 40:07.080
He's in number five.

40:07.080 --> 40:11.080
          Doesn't he have any family?

40:12.200 --> 40:13.840
They're all gone.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.840
He's alone.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.640
If the county can't locate any kin,

40:20.640 --> 40:23.920
which they won't,
they'll bury him in a mass grave,

40:23.920 --> 40:27.720
cos nobody wants bums
taking up too much ground.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.880
THUMP

40:28.880 --> 40:32.880
Take it easy!

40:33.120 --> 40:36.960
Dudley will disappear for ever.

40:36.960 --> 40:40.320
It's not right.

40:40.320 --> 40:44.320
People deserve more than that.

40:44.880 --> 40:48.880
Don't throw him around, OK?

40:49.240 --> 40:51.600
                    He's dead, Wayne.

40:51.600 --> 40:55.600
There's nothing more
you can do for him.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.160
This is Dr Auschlander.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.120
          How do you do?

41:04.120 --> 41:06.040
How is Morena?

41:06.040 --> 41:07.600
She's fine, she's just fine.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.560
She has problems in her
    lower back, but she's responding

41:10.560 --> 41:13.960
well to the drugs we're giving her.
Take her home today, if you like.

41:13.960 --> 41:17.960
What she told me...

41:18.000 --> 41:20.320
that's all true?

41:20.320 --> 41:24.160
First, she was taken
to jail in El Salvador.

41:24.160 --> 41:26.680
I thought she would be killed,
like her husband.

41:26.680 --> 41:30.680
For six months after she arrived
here, there were nightmares.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.960
She was afraid to sleep.

41:33.960 --> 41:37.960
Well, I wish you'd told me
that Morena is an illegal.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.840
Would you have hired her?

41:42.840 --> 41:46.560
          Has she applied for asylum?

41:46.560 --> 41:49.480
She applied, but the judge
at the hearing said

41:49.480 --> 41:53.080
she is an economic refugee, here
to take jobs from Americans.

41:53.080 --> 41:56.520
Did she tell him about the torture?

41:56.520 --> 41:58.640
The judge ordered
to deport her anyway.

41:58.640 --> 42:02.640
If she escaped from a communist
country, like Nicaragua, no problem.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.720
She could stay.

42:05.720 --> 42:09.120
But El Salvador is an ally
of the United States.

42:09.120 --> 42:12.680
Morena could be killed
if she goes back.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.040
I take her.
I'm sorry.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.040
                    What will you do?

42:16.040 --> 42:20.040
Keep hiding her. She's my family.
I'll protect her. She'll be OK.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.720
Unless you turn her in to INS.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.360
No. No.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.400
Morena is welcome
to stay in our home.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.040
She'll be safer there.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.360
You'd do that?

42:34.360 --> 42:37.760
Well, I've seen the way she has
with my son. In the meantime, maybe

42:37.760 --> 42:41.760
we can get some information
from immigration.

42:46.520 --> 42:47.240
Thank you, Dr Westphall.

42:47.240 --> 42:51.240
Thank you, Dr Westphall.
It's all right.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.800
I go and tell Morena.

42:53.800 --> 42:57.800
Donald, is it worth the risk
to take in this woman?

42:59.840 --> 43:02.520
I've played by the rules
all my life, Daniel.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.520
It's never done me
a damn bit of good.

43:04.520 --> 43:07.360
Sometimes we have to
bend those rules to fit the cause.

43:07.360 --> 43:10.600
      Immigration is looking for her.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.600
        You're harbouring a fugitive.

43:12.600 --> 43:16.360
This thing could
explode in your face.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.360
Let me ask you something.

43:18.360 --> 43:21.440
If a Jew showed up here who'd
escaped from the Holocaust and

43:21.440 --> 43:25.440
the government wanted to send her
back to Germany, what would you do?

44:11.480 --> 44:15.480
Old pal, you're
              going down in history.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.920
       You're wasting water, Ehrlich.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.880
Dr Craig?

44:26.880 --> 44:29.000
Who did you think it
was? G Gordon Liddy?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.080
In this light, without my glasses...

44:31.080 --> 44:34.240
                         Oh, shut up.

44:34.240 --> 44:35.880
Would you like the soap?

44:35.880 --> 44:38.760
         Not after where that's been.

44:38.760 --> 44:42.360
If your generation had faced the
responsibility of serving in the

44:42.360 --> 44:46.240
armed forces, you'd know how to take
a navy shower. You look terrible.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.560
I had a tough day.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.840
     Partying on a work night, right?

44:49.840 --> 44:53.200
Oh, you really take
the boob prize, Ehrlich.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.200
You think you can
coast through OBGYN.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.000
I delivered a baby.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.760
            Oh! Well...

45:00.760 --> 45:02.720
What do you want?
A medal of freedom?

45:02.720 --> 45:05.120
The mother needed me. I was there.

45:05.120 --> 45:08.240
I suppose now
you expect me to welcome

45:08.240 --> 45:10.160
the prodigal son back into surgery.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.200
She thanked me.

45:12.200 --> 45:14.360
              Mm-hmm.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.520
  One baby doesn't make a career.

45:16.520 --> 45:20.520
Yes, sir.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.400
Morena?
