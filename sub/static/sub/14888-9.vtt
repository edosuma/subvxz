come over and look.

01:00.633 --> 01:03.300
The‐the Christmas present
my mother sent me from Mypos.

Oh, Balki, it's beautiful.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.400
Is it hand carved?

01:11.433 --> 01:14.133
Yeah, yeah.
It's a Davros cup.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.766
It's made by the
finest artist on Mypos.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.533
Davros Praxiteles.

01:18.566 --> 01:21.433
Look at the detail on it.

01:21.466 --> 01:25.600
It take him one year
just to carve one cup.

01:25.633 --> 01:28.100
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What is this?

01:28.133 --> 01:30.266
Just because it's Christmas Eve

01:30.300 --> 01:31.700
doesn't mean we're
not still workin' here.

Let's go. Come on.

Your mother loves you.

I think it's a
little busy for you.

02:28.266 --> 02:31.466
No, no, it's not for me.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.233
It's for Jennifer.

02:33.266 --> 02:37.533
Oh! Well.

02:37.566 --> 02:41.300
In that case, it's
quietly elegant.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.766
Cost me a $125,
but it's worth it.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.066
I'm gonna give it to Jennifer

We're not having a party.

I‐I wouldn't call
it a party...as such.

You know, just a few‐few people
getting together

03:09.100 --> 03:11.100

No, I didn't ask Mr. Gorpley
to the party.

Well, why not?
He's gonna feel left out.

I want it to be a time for all
our friends to gather together

03:39.666 --> 03:43.066
and share an evening
filled with Christmas spirit.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.600
If Mr. Gorpley came,
he'd ruin everything.

Oh, come on.
How can you say that?

04:14.566 --> 04:16.333
No. I didn't ask my wife.

04:16.366 --> 04:17.533
But I have a hunch

04:17.565 --> 04:19.533
she doesn't wanna
spend Christmas with me.

She's been remarried

caught in your throat?

Gorpley was slime.

But making you work late
on Christmas Eve

What do you think?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.133
Should I add another log?

I mean, here, I want,
I want people to be warm

07:45.533 --> 07:47.266

any better than this.

What could be better
than a party at Christmas

08:15.433 --> 08:17.133
with the people
you care about?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.300
How about this?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.700
How about inviting
someone to that party

08:21.733 --> 08:24.200
who is, who is less
fortunate than you are?

08:26.166 --> 08:29.700
‐ Great idea.
‐ Really?

08:29.733 --> 08:32.232
We'll have to remember
to do that next year.

08:32.265 --> 08:34.332
Well, cousin, cousin

08:34.366 --> 08:36.299
I took it upon myself
to do it this year.

‐ Yeah.

the half of it.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.366
Well, so who is it?

Where did you find
this unfortunate person?

08:54.666 --> 08:58.633
Well, to answer
the second question first

08:58.666 --> 09:02.033
um, I met him down at the paper.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.266
Beautiful.

Who is it?

09:13.100 --> 09:14.466

This is the best eggnog
I have ever had anywhere.

‐ What party? When?
‐ The Christmas party.

we are having here tonight!

09:39.100 --> 09:42.200

10:08.400 --> 10:10.100
Are you crazy?

10:10.133 --> 10:13.233
I specifically said I did not
want him at the party.

10:21.066 --> 10:23.700
Well, you also said that you
thought the Christmas party

10:23.733 --> 10:26.200
would be a time when all your
friends would gather 'round

10:26.233 --> 10:28.266
and share the Christmas spirit.

10:28.300 --> 10:29.366
He is not my friend.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.333
Well he is my friend.

10:31.366 --> 10:35.700
And‐ and it's my party too,
and I'm going to let him in.

Mr. Gorpley ruin

12:24.533 --> 12:27.433
Well, cousin Larry's having
a nervous break dance.

12:27.466 --> 12:29.333
Because..

12:31.800 --> 12:34.100
...just because I invited
someone to the party

12:34.133 --> 12:37.033
who is a little less fortunate
than we are.

12:37.066 --> 12:39.566

12:52.333 --> 12:55.433
Now, just because he's invited

12:55.466 --> 12:58.133
doesn't mean we have to
let him in.

12:59.733 --> 13:02.066
When he knocks on the door,
we'll all be quiet

13:02.100 --> 13:04.666
and he'll think
he's got the wrong apartment.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.300
I can't believe this.
No one can be that bad.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.733

13:14.333 --> 13:16.633
Mr. Gorpley is not popular.

13:16.666 --> 13:18.333
I get that.

13:18.366 --> 13:20.733
And I'm in an okay place
about it.

13:22.233 --> 13:24.466
But let me just say this.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.700
I invited him to this house

13:26.733 --> 13:29.666
and when he comes here,
I'm going to let him in.

13:29.700 --> 13:30.666

13:30.700 --> 13:31.500

'Bartokomous, Appleton?'

Oh, what the..

13:38.433 --> 13:39.533
(Mr. Gorpley)
'I know you're in there.'

13:39.566 --> 13:43.366
'This has happened before,
you know.'

13:43.400 --> 13:45.533
This happened last year at
Lydia's birthday party.

13:45.566 --> 13:47.233
We tried to outwait him.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.166
We sat in the dark
for four hours

13:49.200 --> 13:51.333
listening to the man
pound on the door.

13:51.366 --> 13:52.766
(Mr. Gorpley)
'It was five hours,

13:52.800 --> 13:55.400
and I brought a sleeping bag
this time.'

13:58.733 --> 14:01.166
I guess we're gonna
have to let him in.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.600
Well, now I'm disheveled.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.300
Now look, everyone.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.133
You're gonna see that I'm right.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.100
Deep down inside Mr. Gorpley

14:18.133 --> 14:21.400
there is an ember
of the Christmas spirit.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.766
And if we just treat him
with some kindness

14:23.800 --> 14:26.200
I think we can
fan it into a flame.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.466
Good. I'll get the matches.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.333
Harriette, you don't mean that.

14:35.366 --> 14:38.466
Now, look, how about
when we open the door

14:38.500 --> 14:41.466
we give him a really
beautiful "Merry Christmas"?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.100
A really good one.

the present from Appleton?

‐ I'm dying to see what that is.
‐ 'Oh.'

my Christmas?

Hey, I've had rotten
Christmas' before.

19:00.466 --> 19:02.133
Like the one, uh,
three years ago.

19:02.166 --> 19:03.333

19:03.366 --> 19:05.666
"Merry Christmas.
I'm divorcing you."

19:08.666 --> 19:11.700
Or how about that one
when I was in high school?

19:11.733 --> 19:15.100
And I finally met
my real father.

19:15.133 --> 19:18.566
And he stuck around long
enough to have a drumstick

19:18.600 --> 19:22.366
and steal all the money
that I had saved for college.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.066
Or there was always
the one when I was eight

19:25.100 --> 19:28.533

No, no, no, wait a minute,

opening the presents.

handle that without me.

It does mean a lot to me.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.300
It's a gift of love.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.133
And my mother taught me
that a gift of love

21:16.166 --> 21:19.433
has to go to the one
who needs it the most.
