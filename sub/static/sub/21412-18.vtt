New York Penitentiary,

00:07.211 --> 00:09.307
home to some of the city's
most dangerous criminals,

00:09.375 --> 00:12.073
and an almost impossible place
to break out of.

00:12.390 --> 00:14.940
Lucky for us,
we're trying to break in.

00:15.032 --> 00:18.487
Let's save the word "lucky" for
after we're finished, okay?

00:18.627 --> 00:21.368
Tell me again
why we're doing this.

00:22.837 --> 00:25.448
Norman Osborn claims
he destroyed the Jackal.

00:26.205 --> 00:29.643
But you and I know the Jackal's
really Professor Raymond Warren.

00:30.010 --> 00:32.720
So if the Jackal's gone,
Raymond should be too.

00:33.088 --> 00:34.981
Unless, of course,
Norman is lying.

00:35.150 --> 00:38.502
Norman Osborn? Lie?
Never!

00:39.720 --> 00:40.783
You joke,

00:40.877 --> 00:43.356
but I haven't been able
to convince Harry otherwise.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.158
So if we find Warren
here tonight,

00:45.245 --> 00:47.675
it'll go a long way
to proving my point.

00:47.874 --> 00:50.530
<i>Norman Osborn has people everywhere
who are willing to lie for him.</i>

00:50.617 --> 00:55.002
So I won't believe it until I see it...
with my own eyes.

00:57.179 --> 00:58.980
Professor Warren?

01:00.234 --> 01:01.531
Spider-Man.

01:01.734 --> 01:05.226
I knew it! Osborn claimed
he took the Jackal out.

01:05.373 --> 01:07.468
The Jackal? Gone?

01:07.617 --> 01:10.665
That explains why my beastly
counterpart hasn't checked in.

01:10.752 --> 01:12.898
I'm sorry to hear that,
Spider-Man.

01:13.038 --> 01:15.655
Because we're made in pairs,
you see.

01:15.859 --> 01:19.793
And if one goes,
so must the other.

01:20.937 --> 01:22.632
Good-bye, Spider-Man.

01:22.929 --> 01:25.279
Help! Guards!
I'm being attacked!

01:25.366 --> 01:26.861
What? Keep it down!

01:26.929 --> 01:29.163
Hey!
Who's this guy?

01:32.187 --> 01:33.890
Spidey, we've gotta
get outta here.

01:33.979 --> 01:37.093

Freeze, Spider-Man!

Looks like they got us, Miles.

I'm in camo mode.

You can still learn

03:11.064 --> 03:14.197
Yeah. I just never thought breaking
out of jail would be on the list.

03:14.369 --> 03:15.590
But it paid off.

03:15.736 --> 03:17.669
Now we know that
the Raymond Warren in prison

03:17.737 --> 03:20.801
and the Jackal at Oz Academy
were both fakes.

03:21.142 --> 03:23.943
Meaning the real Jackal
is still out there somewhere.

03:25.646 --> 03:27.460
And that isn't good
for any of us,

03:27.572 --> 03:29.881
because if Norman truly
thinks the Jackal is gone,

03:29.994 --> 03:32.666
then it leaves him and his
family open to an attack.

03:32.799 --> 03:35.520
I have to warn Harry. I thought
he wasn't speaking to you.

03:35.607 --> 03:38.596
He's not. But if his life's in
danger, he'll have to listen.

03:38.799 --> 03:40.400
Want me to
slingshot you home?

03:40.497 --> 03:42.150
No need. See?

03:42.288 --> 03:44.853

I am still learning from you.

03:45.064 --> 03:47.392
- Good luck at Oscorp.
- Thanks.

03:50.671 --> 03:52.638
I have nothing
to say to you, Pete.

03:52.725 --> 03:54.775
Just listen
to me for a second.

03:55.158 --> 03:59.330
I think the Jackal your dad claims
to have destroyed was a clone.

04:00.377 --> 04:01.752
A clone?

04:01.948 --> 04:05.822
Yes. Spider-Man said...
Again with Spider-Man!

04:06.010 --> 04:09.143
Haven't you learned anything, Pete?
The guy's a menace.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.329
Did you hear how he broke into prison
and possibly eliminated Raymond Warren?

04:13.532 --> 04:15.196
It wasn't Raymond Warren.

04:15.314 --> 04:17.712
It's all over the news!

04:17.868 --> 04:20.113
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, Harry.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.821
The thing Spider-Man confronted
in prison wasn't Raymond Warren.

04:23.993 --> 04:26.786
It wasn't even human.
So there's a good chance

04:26.873 --> 04:30.517
that whatever your dad
destroyed wasn't the real Jackal either.

04:31.353 --> 04:35.040
Now, how do I know
you and Spider-Man

04:35.157 --> 04:37.604
aren't just trying to diminish
my dad's achievement?

04:37.684 --> 04:40.454
Because if we were,
we would just go to the press.

04:40.657 --> 04:43.160
Look, if the Jackal
is still out there,

04:43.228 --> 04:45.757
then my best friend's life could
be in danger.

04:46.274 --> 04:47.845
Which is why I'm here.

04:48.064 --> 04:50.377
He must be up
to something, Harry.

04:50.860 --> 04:52.980
Why send a Warren clone
to prison

04:53.071 --> 04:54.868
and a Jackal clone
to Oz Academy,

04:54.962 --> 04:58.806
unless you're trying to distract
someone from something bigger?

04:59.439 --> 05:02.399
The only distraction
here, Parker, is you.

05:04.446 --> 05:05.944
I need to finish this
before class.

05:06.012 --> 05:07.985
So please go.
Uh...

05:20.095 --> 05:24.235
Hey, Dad, can I talk
to you for a minute?

05:27.087 --> 05:30.635
Peter, did you hear what Spider-Man
did to my Uncle Raymond?

05:30.722 --> 05:32.556
Gwen... Gwen, listen.

05:33.126 --> 05:37.126
I have it on good authority that the man
in that prison cell was not your uncle.

05:37.821 --> 05:40.314
In fact,
it was some sort of clone.

05:40.665 --> 05:43.431
What do you mean?
It wasn't him?

05:43.626 --> 05:46.933
That's what I'd like to find out.
And I could use your help.

05:47.020 --> 05:49.798
Do you know if your uncle
was working on anything unusual?

05:50.040 --> 05:53.658
I mean, besides mutating himself
into a human-sized jackal

05:53.745 --> 05:57.228
and... turning Aleksei
into a rhino?

05:57.449 --> 06:00.579
Well put,
but I don't know.

06:00.829 --> 06:02.949
Would it be possible
to look around his house?

06:03.036 --> 06:05.262
Maybe something there can point
us in the right direction.

06:05.329 --> 06:06.953
Sure. I was heading
home for lunch,

06:07.040 --> 06:09.441
but we can swing by
my uncle's place instead.

06:09.528 --> 06:13.798
- Hop on.
- Oh. Uh, o-okay.

06:14.033 --> 06:17.571
So, if Pete's riding on back,
can I take the handlebars?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.024
Harry!
Harry.

06:20.415 --> 06:22.509
Hey, Gwen. Pete,

06:22.579 --> 06:24.356
I thought a lot
about what you said,

06:24.443 --> 06:26.814
and I appreciate
your concern.

06:27.235 --> 06:28.962
I tried to talk
to my dad about it,

06:29.030 --> 06:31.464
but... his ego's too big
to accept the fact

06:31.532 --> 06:33.469
that he might not have
destroyed the real Jackal.

06:33.537 --> 06:36.516
Which means it's up to me to
protect him, to protect us.

06:36.626 --> 06:40.696
So until we find proof that the
Jackal is really gone, count me in.

06:40.978 --> 06:44.431
I'm glad to hear you say that, Harry,
'cause we could really use your help.

06:44.652 --> 06:49.204
Good. Let me start by offering a more
comfortable mode of transportation.

06:50.370 --> 06:52.004
Thanks.

06:54.774 --> 06:57.790
That's weird. I thought we'd
find more of his research here,

06:57.858 --> 07:01.001
but... all these papers
are from his college days.

07:01.128 --> 07:02.532
Ugh!

07:03.351 --> 07:04.868
You okay?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.251
Sorry. Yeah. I just...

07:08.204 --> 07:09.916
It's still weird for me.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.016
First to learn
that my uncle was the Jackal,

07:12.084 --> 07:14.074
and... now to hear he might've
been a clone?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.509
I just...

07:17.087 --> 07:19.048
What's going on?

07:21.595 --> 07:23.673
We'll figure it out, Gwen.

07:24.774 --> 07:26.074
Of course we will.

07:26.142 --> 07:28.868
Here, there's gotta be a tissue
or something around here.

07:30.164 --> 07:32.547
Hey, guys, any idea

07:32.626 --> 07:36.662
what Professor Warren might've
kept at West End Storage?

07:41.509 --> 07:43.082
Empty?

07:43.720 --> 07:45.737
Didn't see that coming.

07:47.841 --> 07:51.915
Why would Uncle Raymond rent such a
large space for just one computer?

07:52.149 --> 07:55.173
And wire it
with security cameras?

07:55.614 --> 07:57.165
<i>Scanning.</i>

07:58.407 --> 08:00.532
<i>DNA recognition complete.</i>

08:00.673 --> 08:03.399
- What was that?
- <i>Hello, Norman.</i>

08:03.548 --> 08:07.103
"Norman"? The DNA scanner must
be confusing me with my dad.

08:07.282 --> 08:10.735
<i>I knew you'd come looking
for my spider experiment.</i>

08:10.845 --> 08:12.399
"Spider experiment"?

08:12.466 --> 08:15.616
<i>And bravo
on finding this place.</i>

08:15.915 --> 08:18.918
<i>Sadly, it's a dead end.</i>

08:19.005 --> 08:23.174
<i>Unless, of course, you came
here looking for your demise.</i>

08:25.020 --> 08:26.186
Look out!

08:27.702 --> 08:29.555
Head for the door!

08:37.655 --> 08:39.078
Peter!

08:39.219 --> 08:40.524
Pete!

08:40.607 --> 08:45.592
Uh-oh. Can't change to Spidey
in front of these cameras.

08:48.199 --> 08:51.810
Uh, but that might be
the very least of my problems.

08:53.852 --> 08:57.920
Gotta keep that secret identity
of mine secret.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.404
That takes care
of one prying eye.

09:04.535 --> 09:05.787
One more!

09:08.178 --> 09:11.107
What would Captain
America do at a time like this?

09:14.769 --> 09:18.615
Yeah! Let's try a little
of Thor's "Meyolnor"...

09:18.755 --> 09:20.459
Meyo... Meow...

09:20.623 --> 09:22.592
Uh, his hammer!

09:24.498 --> 09:27.313
By the power of...
something or other!

09:27.381 --> 09:29.092
Ha!

09:29.240 --> 09:32.083
I gotta say,
being an Avenger's awesome.

09:32.178 --> 09:35.498
But there's nothing better
than being Spider-Man! Hi!

09:36.522 --> 09:38.677
That does not sound good.

09:40.317 --> 09:42.646
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Peter?

09:42.779 --> 09:46.068
- Are you okay?
- What happened to this place?

09:46.599 --> 09:47.898
Yeah, uh,

09:47.966 --> 09:50.617
once the turrets registered
that the Osborn DNA was gone,

09:50.685 --> 09:52.427
they started to power down,

09:52.552 --> 09:55.865
which gave me a chance
to disable the computer system.

09:56.287 --> 09:58.851
Oh... yeah?

09:59.334 --> 10:03.795
Which then caused the turrets
to... self-destruct?

10:04.615 --> 10:08.029
Huh. Yeah, something tells me
there's more to that story.

10:08.209 --> 10:10.982
Something tells me there's more
to these files.

10:11.201 --> 10:13.412
But I'm guessing
everything's encrypted.

10:13.638 --> 10:14.968
Let me try.

10:16.998 --> 10:19.435
None of Uncle Raymond's
passwords work.

10:19.670 --> 10:22.875
But I might have something
that can help.

10:23.575 --> 10:25.224
- What's that?
- A little something

10:25.292 --> 10:26.685
I've been cooking up at school.

10:26.818 --> 10:29.420
It can't necessarily
decrypt files,

10:29.638 --> 10:33.107
but it can show us
where the files were created.

10:33.193 --> 10:36.271
Hang on. Wait.
I know that IP address.

10:36.412 --> 10:38.210
It's Midtown High.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.185
Hopefully this isn't just
another wild-goose chase.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.471
Feels like old times, huh?

10:49.539 --> 10:52.539
'Cause we just did this
at Professor Warren's house?

10:53.203 --> 10:54.907
No. I mean, you and I.

10:54.978 --> 10:58.714
We find a problem, present a hypothesis,
and work together to prove it.

10:59.031 --> 11:02.567
I'm really glad you showed up today, Harry.
It means a lot to me.

11:03.078 --> 11:05.820
Sure. Any idea what
we're looking for here?

11:06.047 --> 11:08.852
A decryption key
or a password list.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.448
Anything that might unlock
Uncle Raymond's files.

11:11.516 --> 11:13.969
Where would you hide
a decryption key?

11:19.858 --> 11:21.006
Huh.

11:21.086 --> 11:23.016
What are you doing?

11:23.562 --> 11:24.844
Look at the floor.

11:24.977 --> 11:28.422
This desk is bolted down, but there
are deep scuff marks all around it.

11:28.524 --> 11:30.217
Almost as if...

11:30.678 --> 11:31.945
it moves.

11:32.210 --> 11:33.866
Whoa.

11:35.383 --> 11:38.031
Not what I was expecting,
but maybe even better.

11:42.836 --> 11:46.305
Whoa. A secret
underground lair.

11:46.766 --> 11:48.383
Where's my treasure map?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.969
I'll just be happy if we find
those decryption codes.

11:52.195 --> 11:53.914
Let's split up
and keep searching.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.508
You are not the person I thought
you were, Uncle Raymond.

11:58.023 --> 12:00.281
Wonder how far back this goes.

12:12.352 --> 12:14.492
This is it!
What'd you find?

12:14.797 --> 12:16.555
Warren's spider experiment.

12:16.727 --> 12:19.227
- His what?
- Dad, I found it.

12:19.313 --> 12:22.109
Lock on to my signal.
You're clear to come in.

12:22.211 --> 12:24.813
What?
What are you doing?

12:25.242 --> 12:26.602
I played you, Parker.

12:26.688 --> 12:29.430
Just like you kept it from me that
you're working with Spider-Man,

12:29.523 --> 12:32.383
I kept it from you that
I'm working with my dad.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.442
There's gotta be a light switch
around here somewhere.

12:36.977 --> 12:38.859
What are you
talking about, Harry?

12:38.968 --> 12:41.172
My father told me
the whole story.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.500
You're right, Pete. Norman does
want to destroy Spider-Man.

12:44.641 --> 12:46.891
'Cause he's a member
of the Jackal's spider army.

12:47.008 --> 12:48.846
- That's not true.
- Oh, no?

12:48.914 --> 12:51.026
'Cause from where I stand,
you just led us

12:51.094 --> 12:54.164
to the very experiment
that created Spider-Man's pow...

12:54.404 --> 12:57.234
They're not here.
Where are the spiders?

12:58.488 --> 13:00.117
Ah. Here we go.

13:06.708 --> 13:10.067
Harry, listen to me. I'm your friend.
That's now how...

13:10.135 --> 13:13.747
No, you <i> were</i> my friend,
until you chose to side with Spider-Man.

13:13.825 --> 13:17.143
Guys!
Gwen, what's the...

13:17.341 --> 13:20.185
Oh, no. Clones?

13:20.395 --> 13:23.263
My Uncle Raymond seems to
be creating dozens of them.

13:23.349 --> 13:24.629
And giving them
all the powers of...

13:24.696 --> 13:26.609
Spiders!
There they are!

13:26.677 --> 13:28.325
He is creating
a spider army.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.263
I told you!

13:32.979 --> 13:34.651
But he hasn't siphoned
their powers yet.

13:34.753 --> 13:36.788
I can still prevent this.

13:37.291 --> 13:39.065
Harry, wait!
No, Pete.

13:39.184 --> 13:42.733
I'm taking these spiders back to
Oscorp, and you can't stop me.

13:57.463 --> 14:00.268
I won't stop you, Harry,
but they might!

14:04.584 --> 14:07.518
Have any other
bright ideas, Osborn?

14:16.298 --> 14:19.313
In fact, I do.

14:26.113 --> 14:27.607
Everybody get back!

14:27.675 --> 14:29.738
The Oz Commandos
will take it from here.

14:29.855 --> 14:31.457
Step aside, Harry.
But, Dad,

14:31.544 --> 14:33.964
I thought I could be
one of the Oz Commandos.

14:34.098 --> 14:35.613
You were wrong.

14:36.808 --> 14:38.910
Let the boy stay, Norman.

14:38.988 --> 14:42.699
I am the general of this
battalion, Otto, not you.

14:42.871 --> 14:46.292
You are a mere doctor
and take orders from me!

14:46.535 --> 14:48.371
Now get my son to safety.

14:48.949 --> 14:50.652
Very well.

14:51.269 --> 14:54.152
Hey!
Come on!

15:02.310 --> 15:04.429
The flame sword?
You've enhanced it.

15:04.497 --> 15:07.466
Yep. Changed the
fuel source for a hotter flame.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.007
Can we discuss this later?

15:09.075 --> 15:11.122
The three of us need to get to safety.

15:11.505 --> 15:13.536
But it's why you need
the mask, isn't it?

15:13.638 --> 15:15.958
Because the fumes
are too volatile.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.325
Harry, Gwen, watch out!

15:23.918 --> 15:26.724
I'm blocked off, but I can
get out through the ceiling!

15:27.106 --> 15:29.583
I'll meet you outside...
eventually.

15:37.474 --> 15:40.578
Ew! Sorry.
Didn't mean to steal

15:40.646 --> 15:43.481
the spotlight from you,
but I figured you could use some help.

15:43.630 --> 15:45.097
Spider-Man!

15:45.513 --> 15:47.400
These clones
are not fully formed.

15:47.487 --> 15:50.154
If we agitate their cells
enough, they'll degenerate

15:50.241 --> 15:53.911
back into their basic
primordial building blocks.

15:57.132 --> 16:00.200
If the sheer number of them
doesn't overwhelm us first!

16:02.185 --> 16:06.411
So this is how you make
a spider army, huh, Raymond?

16:14.677 --> 16:18.599
Well, let me show you
how you prevent a spider army.

16:20.511 --> 16:21.739
Norman, don't!

16:21.807 --> 16:24.544
There's valuable research here
that we can co-opt.

16:24.653 --> 16:28.521
I've made that mistake before, Otto.
I won't do it again.

16:28.653 --> 16:31.935
The only thing left to do
is destroy it!

16:33.317 --> 16:35.763
Ew! It's like
fighting pudding.

16:35.831 --> 16:37.763
But I think that's
the last of them.

16:38.200 --> 16:41.708
You may have defeated
all my clones, Normie,

16:42.028 --> 16:45.896
but you'll never defeat
the true Jackal!

16:47.059 --> 16:49.629
Decided to make an appearance,
huh, Raymond?

16:50.075 --> 16:51.772
Bad move.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.270
Commandos, finish him!

16:56.528 --> 16:58.814
Did you hear me?

16:59.262 --> 17:01.731
I said, "Finish him!"

17:03.708 --> 17:05.964
So sorry, Norman,

17:06.169 --> 17:10.554
but any man who disregards the
importance of scientific research,

17:10.622 --> 17:14.950
no matter how dangerous, doesn't
deserve to be in control.

17:15.096 --> 17:16.125
What?

17:16.278 --> 17:18.671
Besides,
ever since you told me

17:18.739 --> 17:21.387
that Oscorp owns
all my tech,

17:21.458 --> 17:24.637
I've made it my mission
to own Oscorp.

17:24.809 --> 17:28.218
With the help, I might add,
of the very mind-control devices

17:28.286 --> 17:32.309
the Jackal used to control
his Rhino army.

17:33.098 --> 17:34.700
My pleasure.

17:34.795 --> 17:36.606
Didn't see that coming.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.012
I'll get you for this,
you worm!

17:43.182 --> 17:45.395
I'm an octopus, Norman.

17:47.573 --> 17:49.440
Aahh!

17:52.251 --> 17:54.340
Dr. Octopus!

17:54.441 --> 17:58.371
And the Sinister Five
are in my control now!

17:58.605 --> 18:00.535
Where's the young Osborn?

18:00.644 --> 18:02.326
- He escaped.
- Hmm.

18:02.394 --> 18:06.215
Too bad. "Sinister Six"
has a much nicer ring to it.

18:06.457 --> 18:09.496
"Ock's future inmates"
has an even better ring to it.

18:09.586 --> 18:14.248
So, Doctor, is the enemy
of my enemy my friend?

18:14.316 --> 18:17.902
If you hand over the rest
of your mind-control research.

18:18.089 --> 18:21.050
- Otherwise...
- Eh...

18:21.394 --> 18:22.514
Done.

18:22.582 --> 18:23.832
Excellent.

18:23.900 --> 18:27.418
Aahh! Now, that's what I
call a hostile takeover.

18:29.894 --> 18:31.306
Sinister Five,

18:31.434 --> 18:34.004
destroy the spider freak!

18:45.629 --> 18:49.660
And now...
to destroy this thing

18:49.871 --> 18:52.066
once and for all!

18:59.145 --> 19:01.112
Aaahh!

19:06.552 --> 19:09.234
Oh, boy.
That's not good.

19:11.953 --> 19:15.344
Sinister Five, evacuate!

19:26.445 --> 19:28.141
Hold on, Norman!

19:31.079 --> 19:32.789
Dad?

19:35.172 --> 19:36.745
Dad!
Harry, don't!

19:36.813 --> 19:38.849
It's too dangerous!

19:42.923 --> 19:45.924
Spider-Man, save my son.

19:47.864 --> 19:51.411
No! Let me go! No!

20:09.301 --> 20:11.684
I'm so sorry, Harry.

20:12.247 --> 20:14.770
And Peter?
I got him to safety.

20:15.879 --> 20:18.083
I'm sorry, Harry.
I...

20:20.004 --> 20:23.387
What did you do?
We could've saved him!

20:23.473 --> 20:26.129
Harry...
it was him or you,

20:26.197 --> 20:28.809
and he...
He said to save you.

20:29.356 --> 20:31.241
You had no right!

20:31.309 --> 20:34.426
You never liked him!
Never trusted him!

20:34.778 --> 20:37.286
And because of that,
my dad is gone!

20:37.594 --> 20:39.443
I tried.

20:44.879 --> 20:46.579
Just leave.

21:00.959 --> 21:02.881
I tried to save you, Norman.

21:03.327 --> 21:05.600
Even though you
wanted me dead, I tried.

21:05.795 --> 21:10.170
But when you build your empire on
pillars of hatred, fear, and betrayal,

21:10.928 --> 21:13.692
nothing can stop
those walls from tumbling down.

21:14.280 --> 21:17.124
Still have to wrap my mind
around what happened today.

21:18.444 --> 21:22.401
The Jackal, Doc Ock, Harry...

21:22.811 --> 21:25.124
No matter how many
bad guys I take down,

21:25.217 --> 21:28.866
new ones always seem to be
lurking just around the corner.
