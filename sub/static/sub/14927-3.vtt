WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:06.340
SEAN, WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THE REMOTE?

00:06.374 --> 00:07.208
I DON'T KNOW.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.409
IS IT IN THE KITCHEN?

00:08.442 --> 00:10.311
LOOK, THE KITCHEN'S
PRETTY MUCH COVERED
BY "I DON'T KNOW."

00:10.344 --> 00:12.480
WOULD YOU
HAVE BROUGHT IT UPSTAIRS?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.148
I DON'T KNOW!

00:14.182 --> 00:14.815
HERE IT IS!

00:14.848 --> 00:16.550
NOPE, IT'S A TRISCUIT.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.453
OH, DAD,
DON'T YOU DARE EAT THAT.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.321
WELL, WHY NOT?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.056
IT HASN'T BEEN ON THE FLOOR
OR ANYTHING.

00:22.090 --> 00:22.890
OH.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.492
SEAN, ASK CLAUDIA
WHERE THE REMOTE IS.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.360
NO. I DON'T WANT
TO BOTHER HER, MAN.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.362
SHE'S IN ONE
OF THOSE WEIRD MOODS.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.397
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:29.430 --> 00:31.132
WELL, THERE WAS A LITTLE
INCIDENT IN JIMMY'S ROOM,

00:31.165 --> 00:35.203
AND CLAUDIA
GOT A LITTLE FREAKED OUT.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.441
OH, SEAN!

00:40.474 --> 00:41.442
Sean: WHAT?

00:41.475 --> 00:42.843
GET IN HERE!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.378
WHAT'S THE MATTER.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.146
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.447
WE HAVE A VERY,
VERY, VERY, VERY,

00:46.480 --> 00:48.116
VERY, VERY,
VERY BIG PROBLEM.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.083
WHOA.
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.

00:49.117 --> 00:51.852
JIMMY'S DOWNLOADING
PORNOGRAPHY.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.090
OH, JIMMY.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.227
SO, THERE WE WERE
WITH THIS NAKED WOMAN

00:59.260 --> 01:00.461
ON OUR LITTLE BOY'S
COMPUTER,

01:00.494 --> 01:02.563
AND WE DIDN'T AGREE
ON HOW TO HANDLE IT.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.565
CLAUDIA, IF YOU
WANT MY OPINION,

01:04.598 --> 01:06.367
IT'S NORMAL
FOR SOMEONE JIMMY'S AGE

01:06.400 --> 01:08.636
TO BE LOOKING
AT NAKED LADIES.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.337
OH, REALLY?

01:09.370 --> 01:12.106
HOW ABOUT SOMEONE
SEAN'S AGE?

01:13.174 --> 01:14.242
IT WAS YOU?

01:14.275 --> 01:15.209
YES, YES, DAD!
IT WAS ME,

01:15.243 --> 01:17.211
AND IF IT WAS IN FRONT
OF ME, I'D DO IT AGAIN.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.078
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

01:18.112 --> 01:20.214
'CAUSE IT'S PROBABLY
THE LAST NAKED WOMAN

01:20.248 --> 01:21.915
I'LL EVER SEE.

01:21.949 --> 01:26.454
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
CARSEY-WERNER MANDABACH, L.L.C.
AND FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY

01:37.231 --> 01:38.166
YOUR WIFE CAUGHT YOU
LOOKING AT PORNOGRAPHY?

01:38.199 --> 01:40.568
IT WAS ADULT CONTENT,
AND IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.305
WHAT, YOU FELL OFF A LADDER
AND LANDED ON PORN?

01:44.338 --> 01:46.607
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

01:46.640 --> 01:47.708
UH, HENRY,
GO UPSTAIRS.

01:47.741 --> 01:52.613
FINE. THEN YOU CAN'T LISTEN
TO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.250
LOOK, IT WAS ALL JUST
TOTALLY INNOCENT, OK?

01:56.284 --> 01:57.618
I PUT A COUPLE OF BUCKS
DOWN ON THE GIANTS GAME,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.787
AND I HAD TO GO ON-LINE
ON JIMMY'S COMPUTER

01:59.820 --> 02:00.654
TO CHECK THE SPREAD.

02:00.688 --> 02:05.593
OK, GIANTS AT HOME
AGAINST PHILADELPHIA.

02:05.626 --> 02:10.864
"HOT, HOT, SUPER HOT
CHEERLEADERS"?

02:10.898 --> 02:13.167
OH.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.169
YOU'RE NOT A REAL
CHEERLEADER.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.505
CHEERLEADERS
WEAR UNDERWEAR.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.441
OH, YEAH, WHAT TEAM
DO YOU CHEER FOR?

02:20.474 --> 02:23.611
OH, MY GOD.

02:23.644 --> 02:27.648
Woman:
ENTER. COME INSIDE AND PLAY.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.784
WELL, I THINK I WILL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:41.462 --> 02:45.766
WHO IS THIS STUFF
EVEN FOR?

02:52.606 --> 02:56.310
THAT'S
NOT EVEN SEXY.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.749
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

03:01.782 --> 03:06.587
OH, AMATEURS. YEAH,
WELL, IT SHOWS.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.259
Claudia: SEAN?

03:11.292 --> 03:12.460
I'M DOING LAUNDRY, BABY.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.729
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
THAT'S DIRTY?

03:15.763 --> 03:17.398
SEAN?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.300
OH, GOD. OH.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.502
GO AWAY. GO.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.673
OH, GOD.
SEAN?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.382
UM...

03:34.415 --> 03:36.517
GO AWAY.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.518
SEAN?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.002
OH, SEAN!

03:55.035 --> 03:56.370
Sean: WHAT?

03:56.404 --> 03:57.638
GET IN HERE!

03:57.671 --> 03:58.939
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

03:58.972 --> 03:59.707
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.474
WE HAVE A VERY,
VERY, VERY, VERY,

04:00.508 --> 04:02.510
VERY, VERY,
VERY BIG PROBLEM.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.777
WHOA.
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.280
JIMMY'S DOWNLOADING
PORNOGRAPHY.

04:06.314 --> 04:09.016
JIMMY.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.718
JEEZ.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.485
OK. ALL RIGHT.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.287
WE KNEW THIS DAY
WOULD COME, RIGHT?

04:13.321 --> 04:15.489
WE JUST HAVE TO TALK
TO HIM.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.890
UH, WE DON'T REALLY

04:16.924 --> 04:18.492
HAVE TO TALK TO HIM,
DO WE, BABE?

04:18.526 --> 04:19.393
I MEAN, HE'S A BOY.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.328
HE WANTED TO SEE A PICTURE
OF A NAKED LADY.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.464
HE SAW ONE.
NOW IT'S OUT OF HIS SYSTEM.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.832
OH. YEAH, I MEAN,

04:24.865 --> 04:25.533
WHAT BOY WANTS TO SEE

04:25.566 --> 04:28.736
MORE THAN ONE
NAKED LADY. HEH.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.203
YOU BLAMED IT
ON JIMMY?

04:30.237 --> 04:32.606
NO, DAD.
CLAUDIA BLAMED IT
ON JIMMY, OK?

04:32.640 --> 04:34.074
I JUST DIDN'T
CORRECT HER.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.509
JIMMY'S HOME?

04:35.543 --> 04:36.276
NO.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.679
OH, 'CAUSE I HEARD YOU
SAY "JIMMY."

04:38.712 --> 04:41.482
WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR JIMMY?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.084
OH, I'M NOT.

04:44.117 --> 04:44.918
I JUST WANTED TO GREET HIM,

04:44.952 --> 04:47.455
YOU KNOW,
AFTER A LONG DAY AT SCHOOL.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.390
YOU'LL CALL ME
WHEN HE GETS IN, RIGHT?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.959
YEAH. HEH HEH.
SO YOU CAN GREET HIM.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.327
YEAH.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.396
HERE IT IS.
HERE'S THE REMOTE.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.129
ALL RIGHT.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.532
NO, NO. THAT'S
THE STEREO REMOTE.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.068
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.737
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU CAN LET JIMMY

05:03.771 --> 05:04.905
TAKE THE FALL
FOR WHAT YOU DID.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.808
DAD, I THOUGHT THIS
WHOLE THING WAS GONNA
BLOW OVER, OK?

05:07.841 --> 05:08.809
IT WAS CLAUDIA.

05:08.842 --> 05:09.877
SHE WOULDN'T
LET IT DROP.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.414
JIMMY, THE FEELINGS
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
ARE HEALTHY.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.815
WHAT

05:14.848 --> 05:16.950
YOU KNOW.
I THINK HE GETS IT.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.621
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S NATURAL TO BE CURIOUS.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.022
YOU KNOW, ONE MINUTE
YOU'RE THINKING,

05:22.055 --> 05:23.491
"BOY, BASEBALL'S FUN,"

05:23.524 --> 05:24.758
AND THE NEXT,
YOU'RE RUBBING UP

05:24.792 --> 05:26.927
AGAINST MANNEQUINS
AT THE MALL.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.661
WHAT?

05:27.695 --> 05:29.630
JUST STRAIGHTEN UP
AND FLY RIGHT.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.564
OK, I DON'T THINK

05:30.598 --> 05:32.032
WE SHOULD
BEAT THIS THING
INTO THE GROUND.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.066
THE KID
KNOWS HE DID WRONG,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.735
AND HE'S NOT
GONNA DO IT AGAIN.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.804
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DID WRONG,

05:36.837 --> 05:37.571
SO MAYBE I WILL
DO IT AGAIN.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.940
JIMMY, YOU'RE JUST
MAKING IT WORSE.

05:39.973 --> 05:40.774
HOW?

05:40.808 --> 05:41.709
OH, IT'S PERFECTLY NATURAL

05:41.742 --> 05:44.612
TO WANT TO LOOK AT PICTURES
OF NAKED GIRLS.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.780
OK. GOT ANY?

05:48.482 --> 05:49.216
YOU KNOW, MISTER,

05:49.249 --> 05:50.718
WE DIDN'T WANT IT
TO COME TO THIS.

05:50.751 --> 05:51.719
NO, WE DIDN'T.

05:51.752 --> 05:55.823
WE KNOW WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN DOING ON YOUR COMPUTER.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.859
WHOA! CHECK IT OUT.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.961
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS?

06:00.994 --> 06:01.729
I CAN'T TELL.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.664
LET ME LOOK AT IT
A LITTLE CLOSER.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.034
NO. SEAN, THIS IS--
SEAN.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.505
SEAN!

06:11.539 --> 06:12.640
POOR JIMMY.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.708
JIMMY?
HE'S NOT HERE.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.609
OH.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.078
SOME EXAMPLE YOU'RE SETTIN'
AS A FATHER--

06:18.111 --> 06:18.846
LOOKING AT NAKED PICTURES.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.982
OH, YEAH, DAD.
YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.452
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:24.485 --> 06:28.756
YOU'VE GOT BRUSHES TO SELL,
AND SHE'S BUYIN'.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.057
OH, YEAH.

06:30.090 --> 06:30.824
DAD?

06:30.858 --> 06:34.895
KNOCK BEFORE YOU ENTER
THE GARAGE.

06:34.928 --> 06:35.863
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:35.896 --> 06:39.933
UH, BUILDING A BIRDHOUSE.
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

06:39.967 --> 06:42.870
AAH!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.872
IT WAS A FOREIGN FILM.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.073
I'M A FOREIGN FILM BUFF.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.476
OH, COME ON, DAD.
NAME ONE FOREIGN FILM
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.077
THE FRENCH CONNECTION.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.613
YOU EVER SEE
DAWN OF THE DEAD?

06:52.646 --> 06:53.547
THAT'S NOT A FOREIGN FILM,

06:53.581 --> 06:54.648
AND NEITHER IS
THE FRENCH CONNECTION.

06:54.682 --> 06:58.986
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR SHUTTING DOWN
ALL CONVERSATION.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.722
BESIDES, SEAN,

07:01.755 --> 07:02.890
JIMMY'S A MINOR.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.824
I NEVER LET YOU KIDS

07:03.857 --> 07:05.726
LOOK AT DIRTY PICTURES
WHEN YOU WERE HIS AGE.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.794
HEY, DAD, WHEN WE WERE
JIMMY'S AGE,

07:06.827 --> 07:09.563
GETTING OUR HANDS
ON DIRTY PICTURES
WAS NOT EASY.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.998
BELIEVE ME.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.470
ALL RIGHT, EDDIE.
HIS BACK IS TURNED.

07:16.504 --> 07:19.473
JUST GRAB THE CANDY.
HE'LL NEVER CATCH YOU.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.541
OK, OK.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.542
GO.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.944
HEY, MISTER,
THAT KID JUST STOLE
SOME RED HOTS.

07:23.977 --> 07:24.912
HEY!

07:24.945 --> 07:25.746
COME HERE, KID!

07:25.779 --> 07:27.981
COME ON BACK
HERE, YOU LITTLE
MIDGET!

07:28.015 --> 07:28.916
GIVE ME
THAT CANDY!

07:28.949 --> 07:29.983
COME BACK HERE!

07:30.017 --> 07:31.985
I'M GONNA TAKE
YOUR EARS OFF!

07:44.064 --> 07:44.898
I PULLED A MUSCLE

07:44.932 --> 07:47.868
PROTECTING SOME LITTLE
KIDS FROM BULLIES.

07:47.901 --> 07:48.936
OH, GOOD WORK, SON.
HERE,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.137
LET ME WORK ON THAT
FOR YOU.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.705
NO, NO.

07:51.739 --> 07:52.873
I'LL JUST WALK IT OFF.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.942
DON'T BE SILLY.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.209
HERE.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.546
WHOA.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.913
THIS IS STIFF.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.049
LET ME SEE.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.553
OH, HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.121
YOU GOT A SPRAINED PORN,

08:08.155 --> 08:09.056
YOU LITTLE PERVERT.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.191
I CATCH YOU LOOKING
AT DIRTY PICTURES AGAIN,

08:11.224 --> 08:13.961
YOU'LL THINK
THIS IS A LOVE TAP.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.930
IT'S A WHOLE
DIFFERENT WORLD NOW,
DAD.

08:16.964 --> 08:20.834
I MEAN, THEY PIPE
THIS STUFF DIRECTLY
INTO YOUR HOUSE.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.102
WELL, THEY PIPE IN
ELECTRICITY, TOO,

08:22.135 --> 08:25.038
BUT THAT DON'T MEAN
YOU WANT TO STICK
YOUR FINGER IN A SOCKET.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.139
YEAH,
BUT EVERYTHING'S CHANGED.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.175
THEY SEAL PLAYBOYS
IN PLASTIC NOW.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.110
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU

08:30.143 --> 08:32.045
TO ACTUALLY BUY THEM.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.046
IT'S LIKE AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.016
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.118
HEY, JIMMY, WHAT'S UP?

08:38.151 --> 08:39.920
NOTHING. DID YOU
HEAR SOMETHING?

08:39.953 --> 08:42.189
JIMMY,
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.023
LEAVE ME ALONE.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.058
COME ON. I'M JUST
CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.128
I SAW YOU IN THE COMPUTER LAB
WITH SISTER HELEN.

08:48.161 --> 08:48.929
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.330
WHY DO YOU THINK
SOMETHING HAPPENED?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.098
BECAUSE YOU LOOK GUILTY.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.034
WELL, I AM GUILTY,
AND SO ARE YOU.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.703
DON'T FREAK OUT ON ME!

08:55.736 --> 08:56.970
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:57.004 --> 08:59.039
SHE PUT ME
UP TO THIS.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.208
I KNOW I SHOULD
RESPECT SISTER HELEN

09:01.241 --> 09:03.043
BECAUSE SHE'S MARRIED
TO GOD,

09:03.076 --> 09:04.311
BUT, YOU KNOW,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

09:04.344 --> 09:06.847
I THINK HE COULD
DO A LOT BETTER.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.815
MM-HMM.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.951
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT SHE DID TO ME TODAY.

09:10.984 --> 09:11.919
SO, IN CONCLUSION,

09:11.952 --> 09:12.986
WE SHOULD
NEVER TAKE ANY

09:13.020 --> 09:15.589
OF OUR 4 FREEDOMS
FOR GRANITE.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.058
THANK YOU.

09:18.726 --> 09:23.864
LILY, DID YOU SAY,
"FOR GRANITE"?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.165
YES, FOR GRANITE.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.068
AS IN, "DON'T TAKE ANYTHING
FOR GRANITE."

09:28.101 --> 09:31.204
DON'T ASSUME SOMETHING'S
SET IN STONE

09:31.238 --> 09:32.105
WHEN IT MIGHT NOT BE.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.075
I BELIEVE THE EXPRESSION
IS "FOR GRANTED."

09:35.108 --> 09:36.944
CLASS?

09:36.977 --> 09:38.912
All: YEAH.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.480
HEH.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.850
WELL, SISTER HELEN,
MY REPORT IS OVER,

09:42.883 --> 09:44.384
SO YOUR POINT IS MUTE.

09:44.417 --> 09:49.089
I BELIEVE, LILY,
MY POINT IS "MOOT."

09:54.027 --> 09:57.330
MOOT! WHO SAYS "MOOT"?

09:57.364 --> 09:58.131
UH-HUH.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.635
JIMMY, ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

10:01.669 --> 10:02.435
WHAT?

10:02.469 --> 10:05.005
EWW. WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT, PERV?

10:05.038 --> 10:07.307
MOM SHOWED IT TO ME.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.008
SHE DELETED IT,

10:08.041 --> 10:10.277
BUT I DECIDED
TO UNDELETE IT.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.112
GROSS.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.146
HEY, CAN YOU
DO THAT THING

10:13.180 --> 10:15.749
WHERE YOU PUT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S HEAD
ON THAT BODY?

10:15.783 --> 10:18.351
YEAH, IF I HAD
A GOOD PHOTOGRAPH.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.190
OOH. YEARBOOK COMMITTEE.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.993
Lily: IT LOOKS SO REAL.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.327
YOU'RE AN ARTIST.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.395
IT'S NOT PERFECT YET,

10:28.428 --> 10:30.263
BUT I CAN
MAKE IT BETTER.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.965
MOVE.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.958
"YOUR EYES ONLY"?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.131
AAH!

11:04.331 --> 11:07.100
AW, LILY,
THAT SORT OF STUNT

11:07.134 --> 11:09.402
WILL GET YOU KICKED OFF
THE YEARBOOK COMMITTEE.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.839
I'M NOT ON
THE YEARBOOK COMMITTEE.

11:11.872 --> 11:15.142
IT JUST KEEPS GETTING
WORSE AND WORSE.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.109
WHAT DOES?

11:16.143 --> 11:19.079
NOTHING FOR YOU TO HEAR.
GO IN THE OTHER ROOM.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.183
LOOK, JIMMY WAS
GONNA BE EXPOSED
TO EROTICA

11:23.216 --> 11:24.151
SOONER OR LATER.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.819
IT'S BEST THAT HE DID IT
IN THE COMFORT OF HOME

11:25.853 --> 11:27.420
UNDER THE GUIDANCE
OF HIS MOTHER.

11:27.454 --> 11:31.324
SOMEHOW, HIS MOTHER
DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.325
WHAT WAY?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.894
HEY, HENRY, WHAT THE--

11:33.927 --> 11:35.929
WILL YOU JUST GO
TO THE KITCHEN, PLEASE?

11:35.963 --> 11:37.931
I JUST GOT THROWN
OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.868
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
THEN WILL YOU JUST
GO SOMEPLACE?

11:40.901 --> 11:43.070
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO
USE THE COMPUTER.

11:43.103 --> 11:43.636
NO! AH!

11:43.670 --> 11:45.505
DON'T USE THE COMPUTER.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.508
FINE. I'LL GO SIT
IN THE BATHROOM.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.178
I WISH I HAD TO GO.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.381
LOOK, DID YOU
APOLOGIZE TO CLAUDIA?

11:54.414 --> 11:55.382
YES!

11:55.415 --> 11:57.951
I JUST DON'T THINK
I DID A VERY GOOD JOB
OF IT.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.120
CLAUDIA, COME ON.
NAKED WOMEN ARE EVERYWHERE.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.354
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.155
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.057
IT'S LIKE--
IT'S LIKE A SALES TOOL.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.058
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T AVOID IT.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.961
OK, LIKE THAT MAGAZINE
YOU'RE READING, RIGHT?

12:07.995 --> 12:08.962
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE FOR WOMEN.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.031
BUT SEE? HEY, THERE'S
A NAKED GIRL RIGHT THERE.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.266
WHAT'S SHE SUPPOSED
TO BE SELLING?

12:13.300 --> 12:16.469
SHE'S GIVING HERSELF
A BREAST EXAM.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.805
OH. REALLY?

12:17.838 --> 12:20.207
OW. OK, OK, OK.
BUT MY POINT IS

12:20.240 --> 12:21.508
THAT THE WOMEN
THAT YOU SEE IN MAGAZINES,

12:21.541 --> 12:24.044
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO BE
OBJECTS OF LUST.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.480
THAT'S WHY GUYS CAN'T HELP IT.
THEY'RE PERFECT.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.882
THEY'RE PERFECT?
YEAH.

12:28.916 --> 12:32.019
I MEAN, NO, NOT LIKE--
I MEAN, YOU ARE REAL.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.153
OH, YOU'RE COMPARING ME
TO THEM?

12:33.186 --> 12:35.856
NO, BABY,
THERE'S NO COMPARISON.

12:35.889 --> 12:36.689
EXCUSE ME?

12:36.723 --> 12:38.458
TOTALLY SEPARATE CATEGORIES,
YOU KNOW?

12:38.491 --> 12:42.395
LIKE A GUY LIKE ME
COULD HAVE A WOMAN LIKE THAT.
RIGHT.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.230
YOU KNOW?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.031
WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.532
HEY, I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE IT A SHOT.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.067
I LOVE YOU.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.137
YOU'RE A GREAT...MOM.

12:50.170 --> 12:50.871
AAH!

12:50.904 --> 12:52.940
AND YOU,
YOU ARE A GREAT BIG ASS!

12:52.973 --> 12:55.108
OK. SEE,
NOW YOU'RE OVERREACTING,
WHICH I KNEW YOU WOULD,

12:55.142 --> 12:56.376
WHICH IS WHY I LIED TO YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.246
IF I'M SO PREDICTABLE,
WHICH FOOT AM I ABOUT
TO KICK YOU WITH?

12:59.279 --> 13:00.380
YOUR RIGHT?

13:00.413 --> 13:01.281
OW.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.016
WRONG!
OW!

13:03.050 --> 13:03.683
YOU SWITCHED!

13:03.716 --> 13:04.451
Claudia: ARRGH!

13:04.484 --> 13:07.454
DOES THAT MEAN
I'M NOT GETTING ANY?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.259
GREAT ADVICE, MILT.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.927
TALK TO MY BROTHER,
WILL YA?

13:13.961 --> 13:14.962
WHO IS IT?

13:14.995 --> 13:15.863
IT'S MY BUDDY MILT.

13:15.896 --> 13:20.533
HE WAS IN THE EXACT
SAME SITUATION AS YOU.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.434
YEAH?
YEAH.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.170
HIS WIFE CAUGHT HIM
MAKING AN EROTIC FILM

13:23.203 --> 13:24.838
WITH HIMSELF
AND THE PLUMBER.

13:24.872 --> 13:29.442
AH! AH, THAT'S NOT
MY SITUATION, MILT.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.044
FIRST CLAUDIA,
NOW MILT.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.980
YOU'RE PICKING A FIGHT
WITH EVERYONE.

13:33.013 --> 13:33.981
HEY, WHOA.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.582
I TRIED HARD TO END THAT
FIGHT WITH CLAUDIA, OK?

13:35.615 --> 13:37.885
I TRIED VERY HARD.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.856
OOPS. SORRY.

13:42.890 --> 13:46.126
LISTEN, YOU CAN'T STAY
MAD AT ME FOREVER.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.627
OH, I'M NOT JUST MAD.

13:47.660 --> 13:52.632
IT'S REALLY A COMBINATION
OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL

13:52.665 --> 13:53.500
AND BLECCH!

13:53.533 --> 13:54.902
WILL YOU PLEASE GET OFF
YOUR HIGH HORSE,

13:54.935 --> 13:57.004
BECAUSE YOU ARE
NO BETTER THAN ME!

13:57.037 --> 13:57.737
OH, PLEASE!

13:57.770 --> 13:58.805
I HARDLY THINK I'LL BE
TURNED ON

13:58.838 --> 14:02.442
LOOKING AT SOME
STUPID DIRTY PICTURES
ON THE WEB.

14:02.475 --> 14:06.079
OH, YEAH?
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

14:06.113 --> 14:08.448
Sean: "HOT,
BUTTERED BOYS."

14:08.481 --> 14:10.617
THIS REALLY
ISN'T DOING MUCH FOR ME.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.986
COME ON, BABE,
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY
RIGHT HERE?

14:13.020 --> 14:16.489
THE FIREMAN WITH
HIS FIREMAN THONG.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.457
HE'S HOT.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.260
I DON'T THINK THIS SITE
IS DESIGNED FOR WOMEN.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.129
WHAT ABOUT
THE DOCTOR OVER HERE

14:22.162 --> 14:23.931
WITH THE JOCKSTRAP
ON?

14:23.964 --> 14:24.831
WHO?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.266
HEY, CAN I PLAY FROGGER
WHEN YOU'RE DONE?

14:26.299 --> 14:27.935
GOD.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.972
HEY. YOU COULD
JUST SAY NO.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.076
YOU KNOW,
IF I WERE GAY,

14:36.109 --> 14:38.411
I WOULDN'T NEED
ANY OF THAT STUFF

14:38.445 --> 14:39.612
TO GET MY KICKS OFF.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.613
I'D JUST BE STRIPPIN' DOWN,

14:40.647 --> 14:43.216
CHECKING MYSELF OUT
IN THE MIRROR.

14:44.684 --> 14:45.919
YOU DO THAT NOW.

14:45.953 --> 14:49.089
YEAH, BUT I'D REALLY
GET INTO IT.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.423
GOD, MAN,

14:50.457 --> 14:52.659
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.460
I MEAN,

14:53.493 --> 14:55.963
IT SEEMED LIKE IT
WAS WORTH A SHOT.

14:55.996 --> 15:00.167
YOU WERE WASTING YOUR TIME.
WOMEN DON'T RESPOND TO PICTURES.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.936
THEY RESPOND
TO EROTIC THOUGHTS--

15:02.970 --> 15:07.674
WORDS LIKE SATIN,

15:07.707 --> 15:11.979
WISP, BUTTERSCOTCH, SLATHER.

15:12.012 --> 15:16.083
OH, THANKS, EDDIE.
HOW ABOUT, UM, LEPROSY.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.684
COLESLAW.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.186
GO AHEAD, MAKE JOKES.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.321
BUNGALOW.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.590
GOAT CHEESE.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.192
SISTER HELEN.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.460
HI.
HELLO, MR. FINNERTY.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.561
UH, COME IN.

15:28.595 --> 15:34.101
UH, IS THERE
SOME KIND OF PROBLEM?

15:34.134 --> 15:35.035
YES, THERE IS.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.004
I'M AFRAID
SOMEBODY'S BEEN
HAVING SOME FUN

15:37.037 --> 15:38.205
ON THE INTERNET.

15:38.238 --> 15:38.905
OH, MY GOD! I MEAN,

15:38.938 --> 15:41.141
DOES EVERYBODY
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

15:41.174 --> 15:42.609
MR. FINNERTY, I'M--

15:42.642 --> 15:43.643
OH, LOOK, OK, FINE!

15:43.676 --> 15:46.746
ALL RIGHT, I CLICKED
ONTO A NAKED CHEERLEADER SITE!

15:46.779 --> 15:47.547
ALL RIGHT! YES, YES!

15:47.580 --> 15:49.182
I LOOKED AT PICTURES
OF NAKED WOMEN--

15:49.216 --> 15:50.183
DOZENS OF 'EM--

15:50.217 --> 15:52.752
FROLICKING IN ALL KINDS
OF LURID SITUATIONS, OK?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.422
SO, NOW I CONFESS
IN FRONT OF YOU AND GOD.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.424
IS EVERYBODY HAPPY?!

15:57.457 --> 16:00.193
I'M HERE TO SEE LILY.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.596
I THINK SHE'S
IN THE KITCHEN.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.333
OH, MY GOD.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.701
WHAT IS SISTER HELEN
DOING HERE?

16:08.735 --> 16:11.638
WELL, UM, SHE'S
A NUN, YOU KNOW.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.640
THEY KNOW THINGS.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.043
WHAT DOES SHE KNOW?

16:16.076 --> 16:18.078
UM, WELL...

16:31.158 --> 16:35.228
JIMMY, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE QUITE THE COMPUTER WHIZ.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.029
WELL, YOU KNOW,

16:36.063 --> 16:38.331
A LOT OF KIDS
ARE COMPUTER WHIZZES.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.134
I NEED YOUR HELP.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.106
SO, YOU CAN
TRACE THE SOURCE
OF THE E-MAIL

16:46.139 --> 16:48.508
USING THE CODE
AT THE BOTTOM?

16:48.541 --> 16:49.476
UM, YEAH.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.046
SEE, UM, FIRST,
YOU IDENTIFY

16:53.080 --> 16:54.114
THE LOCAL AREA NETWORK

16:54.147 --> 16:57.684
THROUGH THE SMTP ADDRESS.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.287
UM, THEN USUALLY

17:00.320 --> 17:03.123
YOU CAN, UM,
YOU CAN LOCATE--

17:03.156 --> 17:04.157
IT WAS ME!

17:04.191 --> 17:08.128
AND--AND LILY.
IT WAS MOSTLY LILY.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.167
YOU RATTED ME OUT?

17:14.201 --> 17:15.635
I WAS JUST BEING HONEST.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.171
GRANDPA, ARE NUNS
ALLOWED TO HOLD A GRUDGE?

17:18.205 --> 17:20.173
THEY'RE SWORN
TO FORGIVENESS, RIGHT?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.842
NO, THEY'RE SWORN
TO POVERTY AND CHASTITY.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.378
GRUDGES ARE PRETTY MUCH
THE ONLY PLEASURES

17:25.412 --> 17:26.713
THEY'VE GOT LEFT.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.714
OH, BOY.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.450
HELLO, LILY.
AAH!

17:30.483 --> 17:33.120
HI.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.223
I DIDN'T DO IT.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.429
CLAUDIA?

17:44.231 --> 17:46.099
I KNOW YOU'RE KIND OF DOWN.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.033
YEAH, A LITTLE.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.701
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA PUT THE SMILE

17:48.735 --> 17:49.802
BACK ON YOUR FACE.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.870
OH, YEAH

17:50.903 --> 17:53.773
I LOOK AT EROTICA IMAGERY.

17:54.607 --> 17:58.178
WHERE'S THAT SMILE?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.247
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.215
THAT ALL GUYS LOOK,
IT'S NORMAL,

18:02.249 --> 18:03.583
AND THERE'S A LOT
MORE STUFF OUT THERE

18:03.616 --> 18:06.686
THAT'S WAY MORE EXOTIC
THAN WHAT SEAN WAS LOOKING AT.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.588
OK, I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT, OK?

18:08.621 --> 18:11.758
THEY GOT A SITE THAT'S
JUST GIRLS WEARING GLOVES.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.493
NOTHING BUT GLOVES.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.694
GLOVES?

18:14.727 --> 18:20.500
BIG GIRLS WEARING OPERA GLOVES
AND, YOU KNOW, DRIVING GLOVES.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.202
BASEBALL GLOVES.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.137
SHUT IT, OK?
DEFINITELY DON'T.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.372
ALL I'M SAYING, CLAUDIA,
IS THAT, YOU KNOW,

18:25.405 --> 18:27.840
OF ALL PEOPLE,
YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL THREATENED.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.509
THANK YOU, AND I DON'T.
I'M FINE.

18:29.542 --> 18:33.813
GOOD, BECAUSE YOU COULD
HAVE YOUR OWN SITE.

18:34.681 --> 18:35.448
I'M SERIOUS.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.151
YOU'D GET A LOT OF HITS.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.520
I'D CHECK YOU OUT.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.357
OK, THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND SEAN, OK?

18:44.391 --> 18:46.293
OK, BUT LET ME KNOW
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS

18:46.326 --> 18:47.160
ABOUT STARTING THIS SITE.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.262
OTHERWISE, I'VE GOT
TO GET SOMEONE ELSE.

18:49.896 --> 18:53.733
WHAT DID YOU HOPE
TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS STUNT?

18:54.534 --> 18:55.368
CAN I BE HONEST?

18:55.402 --> 18:59.206
SOMETIMES I DO THINGS
TO GET ATTENTION.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.574
I REALLY THINK
IT'S A CRY FOR HELP.

19:01.608 --> 19:05.578
I MEAN,
LOOK AT MY ENVIRONMENT.

19:05.612 --> 19:08.781
IT'S REALLY HARD,
AND I'M JUST A KID.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.652
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I
HAVE NOBODY TO TURN TO.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.953
LET'S TALK PUNISHMENT.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.888
YEAH, LET'S GO.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.592
WELL, I RAN THE SITUATION
PAST THE ARCH BISHOP,

19:19.626 --> 19:20.927
AND HE HAD SOME ADVICE.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.963
HOW DID HE PUT IT?
"GO CRAZY."

19:23.996 --> 19:26.666
SISTER HELEN,
IF I MAY,

19:26.699 --> 19:29.269
IS THIS ABOUT
THE PHOTOGRAPH?

19:29.302 --> 19:30.903
YOU'VE SEEN IT, TOO?

19:30.937 --> 19:31.704
YES, I HAVE,

19:31.738 --> 19:34.241
AND I KNOW YOU MAY
FEEL EMBARRASSED,

19:34.274 --> 19:35.275
BUT REALLY,

19:35.308 --> 19:36.843
YOU OUGHT
TO BE PROUD.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.912
IT WASN'T MY BODY,
MR. FINNERTY.

19:39.946 --> 19:40.880
IT WAS A FAKE.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.616
WELL, YOU COULD KNOCK
ME OVER WITH A FEATHER.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.986
I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY WOULD
EVER KNOW.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.490
WELL, I DO USE
THE AB ROLLER TWICE A WEEK.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.725
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.327
OH, NO?

19:55.562 --> 19:58.331
HERE'S WHAT
I'M THINKING, LILY.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.232
SINCE YOU'RE SUCH
A SHUTTERBUG,

19:59.266 --> 20:01.601
YOU'RE GONNA JOIN
THE YEARBOOK COMMITTEE.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.435
WHAT?

20:02.469 --> 20:03.870
OH, I THINK THEY
COULD USE YOUR SKILLS.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.004
THEY MEET EVERY DAY
AFTER SCHOOL,

20:05.037 --> 20:07.607
AND SATURDAYS
FROM 10:00 TO 4:00.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.009
BUT THE YEARBOOK PEOPLE
ARE SUCH DORKS.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.579
OH, REALLY?
I HADN'T NOTICED.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.315
COULDN'T YOU JUST
EXPEL ME OR SOMETHING?

20:15.348 --> 20:19.819
I'M SORRY, LILY,
BUT THE SUBJECT IS "MUTE."

20:21.388 --> 20:23.723
UH, SISTER HELEN,
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

20:23.756 --> 20:24.591
IT WILL BE.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.592
THAT'S A LOVELY
CARDIGAN YOU'RE WEARING.

20:25.625 --> 20:29.796
PUT YOUR EYES
BACK IN YOUR HEAD,
MR. FINNERTY.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.867
DID YOU
JUST SEND EDDIE UP
TO TALK TO ME?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.569
DID EDDIE
JUST TALK TO YOU?
YES.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.637
DID IT HELP?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:37.670 --> 20:39.639
CLAUDIA,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.975
OK, OK. YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING
DOWN THE STREET

20:43.009 --> 20:43.843
AND YOU SEE A DEAD PIGEON,

20:43.876 --> 20:45.312
AND YOU KNOW
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK,

20:45.345 --> 20:46.346
BUT YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF?

20:46.379 --> 20:47.580
SO, YOU LOOK,
AND THEN YOU NOTICE

20:47.614 --> 20:49.316
THAT THERE ARE MAGGOTS
CRAWLING ALL OVER IT,

20:49.349 --> 20:51.418
AND YOU WANT
TO LOSE YOUR LUNCH?

20:51.451 --> 20:53.286
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

20:53.320 --> 20:56.856
MY MIND IS A DEAD PIGEON,

20:56.889 --> 20:57.857
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK.

20:57.890 --> 21:01.394
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DO THE STUPID THINGS I DO.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.629
I JUST DO, OK?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.431
BUT I LOVE YOU,
AND I'M SORRY.

21:04.464 --> 21:08.468
AND SO, JUST PLEASE,
JUST STEP OVER THE DEAD PIGEON

21:08.501 --> 21:09.702
AND KEEP WALKIN'.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.938
THAT'S THE MOST
REVOLTING APOLOGY

21:11.971 --> 21:14.507
I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.576
DO YOU ACCEPT IT?

21:18.711 --> 21:19.979
HAVE YOU EVER
LOOKED AT THIS SITE

21:20.012 --> 21:21.548
THAT'S ALL ABOUT GLOVES?

21:21.581 --> 21:22.915
GLOVES?

21:22.949 --> 21:23.750
MM-HMM.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.420
BIG WOMEN WEARING
NOTHING BUT GLOVES.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.523
NO. GLOV

21:30.557 --> 21:33.493
OH, GOD,
THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

21:38.030 --> 21:38.765
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
EVER PASSED FOR
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.399
IT'S NOT REALLY DIRTY.
IT'S JUST--

21:39.432 --> 21:40.867
NAUGHTY.
WHAT'S SHE DOING?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.034
SHE'S SITTING THERE
IN HER UNDERWEAR

21:42.068 --> 21:43.069
SCOLDING
A STUFFED ANIMAL.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.005
OH, YEAH.
BAD TIGER, BAD TIGER.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.007
CRACK THAT WHIP, BETTY.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.076
I FIND THIS OFFENSIVE.

21:50.109 --> 21:50.943
THAT'S IT?

21:50.977 --> 21:54.514
WHAT A RIP.
OH, GOD, DAD.

21:55.415 --> 21:58.618
LET'S WATCH IT AGAIN.
LET'S WATCH IT AGAIN.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.652
OH!

21:59.686 --> 22:00.420
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

22:00.453 --> 22:01.988
IT'S BEDTIME.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

22:02.021 --> 22:02.722
COME ON.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.023
WHY WAS SHE SO MAD
AT THAT TIGER?

22:04.056 --> 22:07.059
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
BED. BED.
