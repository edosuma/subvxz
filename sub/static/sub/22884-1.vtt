If you had told me that when I
was your age, I would be here--

00:23.565 --> 00:25.818
doing this now, a
pastor in a church,

00:27.152 --> 00:29.321
Ha, I would have laughed
in your face.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.573
See I was wild.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.953
I was a user, and I loved it.

00:35.995 --> 00:40.123
I fancied myself a rebel
in a world of squares.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.417
Everybody else was just a
bunch of brain-dead zombies.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.712
Me? I was awake,
and I was alive.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.213
God?

00:46.254 --> 00:48.007
God was for suckers.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.468
See I didn't realize I
had it terribly backwards.

00:53.261 --> 00:58.225
May 18, 1987-- I woke
up in a jail cell.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.102
Didn't know where I
was, how I got there,
it was total blackout.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.438
They told me that there
had been a car accident, --

01:04.480 --> 01:07.359
that I had rammed my car
into another vehicle.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.987
I was going 60 miles an hour
in a 30 mile an hour zone.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.490
No one was hurt, thank god.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.409
But you know, they
could have told me

01:15.450 --> 01:17.411
that I killed all four people,
and it wouldn't have
made any difference

01:17.452 --> 01:21.164
because I was coming off
a three-day celebration
of my cousin's graduation.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.919
It was a lot of booze--

01:24.960 --> 01:27.504
a lot of coke for me-- it
was mostly coke because,

01:27.546 --> 01:30.340
hey, it was the '80s
after all, right?

01:30.382 --> 01:34.093
Well, I lost everything,
and I ended up in jail.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.221
Thank you.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.978
See, the four people in that
car were a young married couple

01:43.979 --> 01:45.272
and their two young boys.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.900
And I could've killed them.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.612
That was it for me.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.364
So I entered myself
into a 12-step program.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.075
Complete and total surrender.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.911
You know how great that feels?

01:58.953 --> 02:02.372
What a relief it is to
surrender to something
so completely?

02:02.414 --> 02:04.959
To just walk away
from everything.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.835
To establish a relationship.

02:06.877 --> 02:11.882
Something so much more
powerful than yourself
and your frail little ego.

02:11.924 --> 02:15.302
But it was only because of Him.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.264
See most people,
they look to God

02:19.306 --> 02:21.349
as a means to get into heaven,
a way to cope with death.

02:21.391 --> 02:26.855
But for us users, us addicts,
it's a way to cope with life.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.357
Just to get us through
another day without using.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.613
The day I woke up in jail--

02:34.655 --> 02:39.200

my life was done.

[police sirens]

13:57.754 --> 13:58.588
[boy] Danny!

14:04.511 --> 14:08.389
[doctor 1] <i> Your daughter has</i>
<i>experienced a very powerful</i>
<i>drug interaction,</i>

14:08.431 --> 14:10.517
<i>which has wreaked</i>
<i>havoc on her body.</i>

14:10.558 --> 14:13.144
<i>-There really is very</i>
<i>little you can do now--</i>
-[doctor 2] <i> She's sleeping now</i>

14:13.186 --> 14:14.437
[doctor 1] --except wait for
her to wake up.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.854
[doctor 2] <i> There's no way to</i>
<i>predict--</i>

14:15.896 --> 14:16.981
[doctor 1] <i> We're awaiting</i>
<i>toxicology reports--</i>

14:17.023 --> 14:18.316
[doctor 2] <i> --if she'll</i>
<i>wake up.</i>

14:18.358 --> 14:19.651
[doctor 1] <i> When it returns,</i>
<i>we'll know more.</i>

14:19.693 --> 14:20.485
<i>There's something you need</i>
<i>to understand...</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:22.487
Oh, Lord have mercy.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.115
[doctor 1] <i> There's a very real</i>
<i>possibility that Kayla may</i>
<i>never wake up.</i>

14:26.157 --> 14:27.908
[crying]

14:27.950 --> 14:31.538
[heart monitor beeping]

14:32.413 --> 14:33.540
Oh my god.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.964
Excuse me, Mrs. Stevenson?

14:43.090 --> 14:44.467
I'm Officer Mackenzie.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.763
I know this is a very difficult
time for you right now,

14:48.805 --> 14:51.725
but if you have a few
minutes, I would like
to ask you a few questions.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.434
You going to put
my baby in jail?

14:54.143 --> 14:55.061
No ma'am, I--

14:55.102 --> 14:56.771
How dare you?

14:58.690 --> 15:01.818
She almost died
tonight because of you.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.489
They were too afraid of the
cops to call an ambulance,

15:07.615 --> 15:10.744
and you want to
ask me questions.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.246
I'm sorry, I--

15:13.287 --> 15:14.664
No.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.751
I've got a question for you.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.169
That what you do?

15:20.211 --> 15:22.797
Arrest children?

15:22.839 --> 15:26.593
You want to put all our
children in jail, for what?
Being children?

15:28.344 --> 15:32.181
If it wasn't for these two
boys, my baby would be dead.

15:32.223 --> 15:35.810
And you have the
audacity [crying]

15:35.852 --> 15:38.730
to come to my
daughter's hospital bed

15:39.898 --> 15:41.941
and interrogate us now?

15:43.568 --> 15:44.402
I'm so sorry.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.251
Get it together.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.177
Protect and serve.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.849
Protect and serve.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.358
Hi.

16:25.109 --> 16:25.944
Hello.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.744
I'm sorry about that.

16:36.579 --> 16:37.538
Well.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.375
She's usually very nice.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.044
It's just a lot
for her, you know?

16:46.172 --> 16:50.134
Yeah, well I shouldn't
have done that.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.388
It's nothing personal.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.724
You seem like a really
nice guy, for a cop.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.435
Thanks.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.231
I always feel weird
coming into hospitals.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.025
I never want to touch
anything, you know?

17:07.443 --> 17:11.739
Yeah, me too, but
part of the job.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.366
Bummer.

17:28.006 --> 17:28.840
I'm Arin Robinson.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.387
Arin?

17:35.847 --> 17:38.098
So you're the guy
who spoke to the EMT?

17:39.141 --> 17:41.310
Well Arin, I'm
Officer Mackenzie.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.604
What you did tonight
was a hero move.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.773
Not really, but thanks.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.484
Arin, do you need a ride home?

17:49.652 --> 17:51.738
So you like her?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.280
She's Kayla Stevenson.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.282
Everyone likes her.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.952
Nobody seemed to like her
enough to save her
life tonight.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.955
Except you.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.666
So how come her boyfriend
didn't call 911?

18:03.708 --> 18:06.753
I thought of it
first, I suppose.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.005
And what, they made
you designated driver?

18:09.047 --> 18:13.300
Well, I don't drink and I don't
do drugs, so I made a good fit.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.679
Was everyone doing
drugs at the party?

18:16.721 --> 18:18.014
You'd have to ask them.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.935
All right, who were they?

18:21.976 --> 18:23.143
Who gave them to her?

18:23.185 --> 18:24.478
I can't help you there.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.481
Who gave Kayla the drugs?

18:27.523 --> 18:30.192
I'm not a rat, officer.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.112
Arin, there's a teenage girl
who almost died tonight.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.782
This is serious business
we're talking about here.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.784
If you're afraid of those
guys coming after you,

18:37.825 --> 18:39.535
we can help you.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.913
Look, I may be
small, but I'm not

18:41.955 --> 18:44.498
afraid of you or your
badge, and I'm definitely

18:44.540 --> 18:47.209
not afraid of any kid
with a bag of dope.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.087
The only thing
that I fear is God.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.763
Yeah, I like your bracelet.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.016
WWJD, huh?

19:02.058 --> 19:06.062
Man, you know being a Bible
thumper and a straight edge,

19:07.187 --> 19:10.066
can't make you very
popular, can it?

19:10.108 --> 19:15.071
Well, as I recall, JC wasn't
particularly popular, either.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.824
I also remember that
the cops of that era

19:17.865 --> 19:21.786
nailed him to a piece of wood
for speaking truth to power.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.413
Look, kid, I'm not in
the crucifixion business,
all right?

19:24.455 --> 19:26.833
All I want is the truth.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.584
That's exactly
what they told JC.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.089
Thanks for the ride,
Officer Mackenzie.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.217
Yeah, sure thing.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.720
Arin, wait.

19:39.762 --> 19:43.349
If you change your mind about
anything, you've got my number.

19:43.975 --> 19:44.809
You bet.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.375
[sirens]

20:09.416 --> 20:10.292
Hi, officer.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.461
Some man just attacked our son.

20:12.503 --> 20:15.548
He took him, he tried
to grab him, run off.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.466
We ran after him,
and we got him back.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.968
Tell him what happened.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.888
This man came, and
he grabbed our son,

20:21.929 --> 20:24.098
and he tried to
take him from us.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.558
[knocking]

20:25.599 --> 20:27.143
Police, open the door.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.228
Come on in.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.106
Police, I'm coming in.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.024
Come on in.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.274
I'm not gonna bite you.

20:39.947 --> 20:40.948
Mike?

20:40.990 --> 20:42.200
Yep.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.409
Mike Phillips?

20:43.450 --> 20:44.284
That's me.

20:46.662 --> 20:47.872
Robert Mackenzie?

20:52.376 --> 20:53.711
I heard you joined the mil.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.881
I did-- Marines.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.175
Three tours.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.634
Three tours, wow.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.975
[inaudible] I've got this one.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.940
Well, well, well.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.525
Bo Mackenzie a cop.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.070
I never would've in a million
years seen that one coming.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.989
Congratulations Bo.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.909
I won't tell them
the truth about you.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.370
Mike, I just
received a complaint
that you assaulted a child.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.165
Yeah, well.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.377
I think I did.

21:35.419 --> 21:40.674
Say, I get a little
confused sometimes.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.593
Is he okay?

21:42.635 --> 21:43.928
I didn't mean to scare
the little bugger.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.888
Yeah, he's fine,
just a bit shaken up.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.848
Yeah, yeah.

21:47.890 --> 21:52.686
I had a bit mixed up
with the meds today.
It's no excuse, I know.

21:55.273 --> 21:59.526
I thought he was
going to trip an IED,

21:59.568 --> 22:02.780
and I was trying
to save his life.

22:09.287 --> 22:12.081
Some hero, huh?

22:12.123 --> 22:16.002
Mike, anyone who puts on a
uniform for their country
is a hero.

22:16.043 --> 22:16.877
Yeah.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.088
Sure.

22:21.423 --> 22:24.177
You have a younger
brother, right?

22:25.303 --> 22:27.638
Yeah, Danny?

22:28.306 --> 22:29.389
Good kid.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.642
Nice kid.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.269
Not like we were, right?

22:33.311 --> 22:34.228
Danny.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.522
Yeah why do you ask?

22:36.563 --> 22:40.484
Is there someone I could call
to come over and be with you?

22:40.526 --> 22:42.111
How about some strippers?

22:42.987 --> 22:44.613
How about your wife?

22:45.363 --> 22:46.199
Sheila?

22:48.575 --> 22:50.536
She don't want nothing
to do with me no more.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.622
Ah, don't worry though.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.500
My little bro will be here in
the morning, sure as clockwork.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.543
You mean Danny?

23:02.965 --> 23:04.550
Mike, if I leave
you alone, will you

23:04.591 --> 23:07.678
promise me that you won't go
outside till tomorrow morning?

23:08.929 --> 23:11.140
[groan]

23:11.182 --> 23:13.100
Mike, if I leave you
alone tonight, will

23:13.142 --> 23:15.061
you promise not to
go out till--

23:15.102 --> 23:16.645
[snoring]

23:16.687 --> 23:17.521
Mike.

23:20.149 --> 23:20.983
Great.

23:31.618 --> 23:32.703
Well.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.455
Mike Phillips, huh?

23:50.888 --> 23:54.350
[snoring]

23:58.687 --> 23:59.688
Mike.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.233
Mike.

24:04.068 --> 24:04.902
Mike.

24:05.819 --> 24:06.946
Hey, Mike!

24:07.405 --> 24:12.118
It's me.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.748
Danny boy, hey.

24:20.876 --> 24:21.835
What time is it?

24:23.337 --> 24:24.964
7:30 in the morning.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.049
Mom wants to know if you
want to come to church.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.096
Do you want to come
to dinner tonight?

24:33.013 --> 24:35.182
How was the party last night?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.851
It was okay, but--

24:37.893 --> 24:41.063
it started out cool, then
everyone got pretty wasted.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.191
Sounds awesome.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.734
Kayla was pretty sloppy.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.485
Ugh, that's the worst.

24:47.527 --> 24:51.073
There's nothing
worse than a girl
that can't hold her liquor.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.033
She really hit it
hard, you know?

24:54.285 --> 24:55.577
I can imagine.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.079
Her sister is like that too.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.206
Cassie, wild chick.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.041
Just wild.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.336
She got sick, and I had
to watch her all night.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.379
Oh, man.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.173
That's the worst.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.011
I got stories I
can tell you, but

25:12.052 --> 25:13.471
hope you behaved yourself.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.723
Whoo!

25:16.765 --> 25:19.643
What would you say if
I had this friend--

25:19.685 --> 25:23.105
a good friend, and this
friend did something

25:23.147 --> 25:26.733
that was kind of stupid,
and totally wrong,

25:26.775 --> 25:28.861
and someone got
hurt because of it,

25:28.902 --> 25:32.365
but no one took
responsibility for it?

25:32.406 --> 25:36.327
Well Danny, a Marine
lives by a certain code.

25:37.870 --> 25:41.707
A code of integrity that
can't be compromised.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.793
Well--

25:44.835 --> 25:48.588
It means, Daniel--
doing the right thing,

25:48.630 --> 25:50.757
regardless of whether
you're going to get caught
or not.

25:56.013 --> 26:01.394
That's pretty righteous stuff,
but it's a good thing you're
not a Marine anymore, eh?

26:01.435 --> 26:03.396
You're in it for life brother--

26:03.437 --> 26:05.105
no such thing as an ex-Marine.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.986
Honor, courage, commitment.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.199
Courage.

26:15.241 --> 26:21.163
It is the willingness to
take a stand, regardless
of adverse consequences.

26:21.205 --> 26:26.960
It's the will to heed the
inner conscience, and the will

26:27.002 --> 26:31.090
to do what is right, regardless
of the conduct of others.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.552
It's not enough to
know what to do.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.762
You have to do it.

26:36.803 --> 26:42.851
Courage is the mastery of
fear and to always do what
is right,

26:44.144 --> 26:46.439
even in the face of death.

26:46.480 --> 26:51.944
You have to follow a higher
path that normal people are
too weak

26:51.985 --> 26:54.905
or too afraid to follow.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.533
Semper fi, Danny.

27:01.161 --> 27:04.873
Semper fi-- always faithful.

27:06.875 --> 27:12.465
Always faithful to family,
God, country, the Corps.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.217
It is faith that
makes a man a Marine,

27:15.259 --> 27:20.389
and it is faith that makes a
man become more than
who we are.

27:20.431 --> 27:24.810
And only through faith can the
impossible become possible.

27:24.851 --> 27:27.729
With faith, anything
is possible?

27:27.771 --> 27:29.523
No.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.066
But at least you're
not nothing.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.407
[phone ringing]

27:50.294 --> 27:54.840
[man] <i> The pride of your</i>
<i>heart has deceived you.</i>

27:54.881 --> 27:57.968
<i>You, who live in the</i>
<i>clefts of the rocks</i>

27:58.010 --> 28:00.262
<i>and make your home</i>

28:05.058 --> 28:08.937
<i>You, who say to yourself,</i>

28:18.822 --> 28:25.287
<i>among the stars, from there,</i>
<i>I will bring you down,</i>

28:25.329 --> 28:27.122
<i>declares the Lord.</i>

28:36.756 --> 28:40.177
[phone ringing]

28:46.808 --> 28:49.645
[running footsteps]

29:01.490 --> 29:02.324
Hi.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.161
I'd like to speak to
someone about something

29:06.203 --> 29:08.830
that happened last night.

29:08.872 --> 29:13.669
I'm only going to say
this one more time,
Mackenzie, you are soft.

29:13.711 --> 29:18.298
This is a war, and make
no mistake about it
we are losing.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.883
You better show me
something, Mackenzie.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.219
You better show me real
quick, or you're done.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.972
Yes sir, I mean
I will sir.

29:26.014 --> 29:30.102
Now that assault last night.
What happened? I didn't see
anything in my bin.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.229
It was just a
misunderstanding, sir.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.606
I let him walk.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.982
A kid gets assaulted,
and you let the guy walk?

29:37.150 --> 29:38.318
Yes, sir.

29:38.985 --> 29:40.320
A kid?

29:40.362 --> 29:43.449
It was just a misunderstanding
between neighbors.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.075
It's all cleared up now.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.868
Well that's good.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.704
That's good, because
if it comes back

29:48.746 --> 29:51.998
that this neighbor kid gets
so much as a hair out of place

29:52.040 --> 29:53.833
by this friendly
guy that you let

29:53.875 --> 29:58.547
walk, who ends up being some
sort of kiddie-jumping psycho.

29:58.589 --> 30:01.216
Do you have any idea what
it's going to do in
this department?

30:01.258 --> 30:03.802
I'm going to get fired, and
you're going to get fired,

30:03.843 --> 30:07.180
and we're going to sit
together unemployment and keep
each other company.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.475
I don't want to
sit in unemployment
with you, Mackenzie.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.017
I don't like you.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.228
So get the marshmallows out of
your face, lose some weight,

30:13.270 --> 30:15.355
tuck in that shirt,
stand up straight,

30:15.397 --> 30:17.899
and get out on the street
and make some arrests.

30:17.941 --> 30:18.776
Dismissed.

30:19.610 --> 30:20.736
Yes, sir.

30:20.778 --> 30:21.612
Thank you, sir.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.579
And find out where the
Stevenson girl got those drugs.

30:30.621 --> 30:34.040
Comes down from the top.
If she croaks, we're talking
homicide, so look alive.

30:34.082 --> 30:34.916
Yes, sir.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.838
[slow music playing]

31:07.449 --> 31:09.785
If Kayla dies, they're
gonna charge us with murder.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.625
Man, you look like
death, Dean-o.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.294
Been out here all night.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.253
Cops around my house.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.342
Had to stash my stash.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.470
What happened to Kayla?

31:28.512 --> 31:30.138
I was at the hospital.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.014
She's in a coma.

31:34.934 --> 31:35.769
Oh, wow.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.273
Is she gonna make it?

31:40.315 --> 31:41.567
They don't know.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.068
She was like inches from death.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.741
That's crazy.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.201
They said if she
dies, it's a homicide.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.039
Yeah, I've been good friends
with her since second grade.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.292
I went out with
her in sixth grade.

32:01.127 --> 32:05.507
She got me high for the
first time right there.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.467
No way.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.597
I'd never hurt her.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.390
She's the coolest person
I know.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.350
Why'd you guys break up?

32:17.143 --> 32:18.812
She's crazy, I don't know.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.355
Her energy is scattered.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.900
We always remained good
friends, but there's just

32:22.941 --> 32:24.943
no way of getting
close to her, you know?

32:26.152 --> 32:28.280
She just deflects
anything serious.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.323
It's like she
wouldn't let you in.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.701
I don't really know her at all.

32:32.743 --> 32:37.330
She dated a lot of guys that
treated her bad, like garbage.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.667
They were older guys that
never really lasted long.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.962
But then she dated you.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.381
For the life of me, I don't
know why she asked me out.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.007
I do.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.135
Why?

32:50.176 --> 32:52.262
Well, well, well.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.889
I thought I'd find you here.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.349
What up, Phil?

32:56.391 --> 32:57.309
Hey.

32:57.350 --> 32:59.018
Sup, Abercrombie?

32:59.060 --> 33:01.730
Dean-o, did you know there's
a cop in your driveway?

33:01.772 --> 33:03.315
Kayla's in a coma.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.024
Are you serious?

33:05.066 --> 33:07.569
Well dude, that's what happens
when you sell H to teenagers.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.321
Is she okay?

33:09.362 --> 33:11.740
Uh, no, she's in a coma.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.242
Well, this is all
your fault, Dean-o.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.452
My fault?

33:15.494 --> 33:16.745
You were the one who
gave her those mystery

33:16.787 --> 33:18.538
lines of your street
junk bag whatever it was.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.499
That was the most irresponsible
thing I've ever seen.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.375
Yeah, but I knew she
could handle that.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.170
You gave her the H
after she was trashed.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.839
You knew how messed up she was.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.214
You could have stopped me.

33:28.256 --> 33:29.549
I'm not the party nanny, dude.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.009
Yes you are.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.260
When you're 25 and hang
out at high school parties,

33:32.302 --> 33:33.762
you are the party nanny.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.597
She said they were
prescribed by doctors--

33:35.639 --> 33:37.056
that they wouldn't do anything.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.266
She said that would be fine.

33:38.308 --> 33:40.226
What are you talking about?

33:40.268 --> 33:43.563
Before the party, I
gave her some pills
that I stole from my brother.

33:43.605 --> 33:44.731
What kind of pills?

33:44.773 --> 33:46.358
[Phil] Your brother has pills?
What kind?

33:46.399 --> 33:48.360
-I'm going to come clean.
-What?

33:48.401 --> 33:49.862
I'm going to tell
them all the truth--

33:49.903 --> 33:50.946
the cops, her mom.

33:50.988 --> 33:51.822
[Phil] Why?

33:52.447 --> 33:53.615
I've decided.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.784
It's the honorable thing to do.

33:56.326 --> 33:57.243
Honor?

33:57.285 --> 33:58.411
My brother's a Marine.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.288
He told me about honor.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.957
Okay, the honorable thing?

34:01.999 --> 34:03.792
Let me tell you
something about honor.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.585
Honor demands a
code of silence.

34:05.627 --> 34:08.295
Honor demands you never
rat on a fellow friend.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.841
I know you want to come clean
right now and everything, man,

34:10.882 --> 34:12.551
but what good is
it going to do you?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.928
It's not going to help
Kayla come out of her coma,

34:14.969 --> 34:17.263
it's not going to help
her with her treatment.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.099
It's going to ruin your life,
it's going to ruin your family,

34:20.141 --> 34:21.226
it's going to ruin your mother.

34:21.266 --> 34:24.228
Dude, it's going to
ruin your brother.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.481
You'll never get
into a good college.

34:26.523 --> 34:29.735
I mean, that's just a few
things to think about,
other than yourself.

34:29.775 --> 34:31.277
But we gave her the drugs.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.487
She's in the hospital.

34:32.821 --> 34:33.989
Okay.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.824
Let's make a deal then, okay?

34:35.866 --> 34:39.327
When Kayla wakes up,
whatever-- come clean.

34:39.369 --> 34:40.746
But if she doesn't, then--

34:40.786 --> 34:42.831
Dude, she's going to wake up.

34:42.873 --> 34:45.918
But if she doesn't, then we
take this little
code of silence

34:45.958 --> 34:49.670
to our grave, based
upon honor, Daniel.

34:49.713 --> 34:50.630
Honor, man.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.591
Think about your life.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.509
Think about your family.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.014
Just until she wakes up?

34:59.056 --> 34:59.890
Yes.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.350
Okay.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.269
Okay.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.145
Okay, then it's agreed.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.439
We swear on an oath of blood.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.818
An oath of blood.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.321
But Arin, but Arin what?

35:15.363 --> 35:17.991
Last night at the hospital,
the cops were all over him.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.035
He was the one who called 911.

35:20.077 --> 35:21.536
I don't know what
he said to them.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.707
The little man?

35:25.749 --> 35:28.126
If it's not one
thing, it's another.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.503
All right, well you'll
leave him up to me.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.797
I'll take care of it.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.090
What are you gonna do to him?

35:35.592 --> 35:40.055
So Danny, brother, pal, can you
score me your brother's meds?

35:40.097 --> 35:40.931
Dude.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.101
How about a sandwich?

35:57.948 --> 35:59.032
Hey, little man.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.117
Hey.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.159
I hear you been
talking to the cops.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.036
-I don't like that.
-Uh-huh.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.537
-What'd you tell them?
-Nothing.

36:04.579 --> 36:05.789
What did you tell them?

36:07.624 --> 36:09.250
You want to know if I
told them the truth,

36:09.292 --> 36:12.295
that you're a dealer, that you
gave drugs to Kayla Stevenson?

36:12.337 --> 36:13.421
You shut your mouth!

36:13.463 --> 36:14.756
Dude, don't.

36:18.135 --> 36:19.803
Why don't you ask them
yourself?

36:20.887 --> 36:22.097
This isn't over, little man.

36:28.311 --> 36:31.940
If I did rat you out, they
would've busted you already,
Einstein.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.657
Officer Bob, we meet again.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.743
Good morning, Arin.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.204
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

36:47.664 --> 36:48.790
I just wanted,

36:48.832 --> 36:50.542
I just wanted to stop by and...

36:53.628 --> 36:56.882
Look I want to apologize.

36:56.923 --> 37:01.386
Yeah, I lied to you the other
night when I talked about Dean.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.388
We didn't really find him.

37:03.429 --> 37:04.597
Truth is, no one's seen him.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.349
We don't know where he is.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.768
So he didn't tell
us everything.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.563
I just wanted to prod you
to get you to open up to me.

37:11.604 --> 37:12.438
I understand.

37:12.856 --> 37:13.940
Thanks.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.401
Yeah, it's just some
stupid cop trick

37:16.442 --> 37:17.944
that they teach us at
the academy, you know?

37:17.986 --> 37:19.905
I think I saw that
in a movie once.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.742
Yeah, well it
usually works but

37:23.783 --> 37:25.535
I must admit you're a
tough nut.

37:25.577 --> 37:29.497
You know, this doesn't seem
like the normal
cop thing to do.

37:29.539 --> 37:32.792
Is this some new
department philosophy?

37:32.834 --> 37:37.630
No, this is some new personal
philosophy that I'm trying out,

37:37.672 --> 37:39.758
because after all I'm--

37:39.799 --> 37:41.676
that's the only
philosophy I need.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.596
All right, Officer Bob.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.516
All right, see you, Arin.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.273
[heart monitor beeping]

37:55.314 --> 37:56.149
Mom.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.444
Cassie, thank god.

38:02.405 --> 38:03.782
Is she okay?

38:03.823 --> 38:04.866
They don't know.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.993
I'm so glad you're here.

38:07.035 --> 38:10.580
You look terrible.
You need to sleep.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.958
I don't want to leave
her alone.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.751
She might wake up any minute.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.504
She's going to wake up.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.424
She took every drug
in the book, Cass.

38:22.259 --> 38:23.260
Every one.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.429
Kayla, why?

38:26.471 --> 38:27.722
I don't know.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.433
Why would she do that?

38:32.644 --> 38:33.812
Has Dad come?

38:35.272 --> 38:36.481
Must be out of the
country or something

38:36.522 --> 38:39.192
because he hasn't picked
up his phone at all.

38:39.609 --> 38:40.860
Typical.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.862
Must have called
him a dozen times.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.199
Would you try?

38:46.241 --> 38:47.575
I'm not going to talk to him.

38:47.617 --> 38:48.952
He's her father.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.165
I just can't even deal
with him right now.

38:53.206 --> 38:56.251
I know that Kayla wouldn't
want to talk to him.

38:57.710 --> 39:00.088
I'm glad he's not here.

39:00.130 --> 39:04.092
He chose to leave,
so let him stay lost.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.398
Did you talk to him?

39:19.440 --> 39:20.942
He said he might come.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.862
What'd he say?

39:23.903 --> 39:27.699
I said to him, mom wants to
know if you'll come to dinner,
and he said, will see.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.785
[sigh]

39:32.204 --> 39:33.121
I don't know what to do.

39:35.581 --> 39:38.835
[door opens]

39:39.169 --> 39:40.419
Bo.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.838
Hey Mike, how's it going?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.715
It's going good.
What's up?

39:43.756 --> 39:45.508
Just wanted to come
by, check on you.

39:45.550 --> 39:48.011
You know I almost got fired
last night for not
dragging you

39:48.053 --> 39:49.971
into a holding cell for
assaulting that child.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.891
You know what?
You look really good.
You feeling better?

39:52.932 --> 39:55.143
I'm feeling great.
Thanks, Bo.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.936
Great, awesome.
I'm glad to hear it.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.023
You almost got fired?

40:00.065 --> 40:02.525
Yeah. But you know what?
It's okay.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.861
We go way back, so buddies
stick together, right?

40:06.196 --> 40:07.030
All right.

40:09.366 --> 40:11.492
I wanted to ask you--

40:11.534 --> 40:13.953
want to go out for a beer
or something right know?

40:13.995 --> 40:15.872
You want to have a
beer with me.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.209
Well sure, why not?

40:20.043 --> 40:21.336
If you're up for it.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.589
Absolutely, Bro.

40:24.630 --> 40:25.840
All right, cool.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.887
Remember that match
back in our junior year,

40:30.929 --> 40:34.307
where you pinned
that guy in what,
almost three seconds?

40:35.308 --> 40:37.060
You remember that, huh?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.687
Oh my gosh, it was epic.

40:39.729 --> 40:44.025
It was like the fastest
time in state history.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.526
It was a semifinal match.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.028
Hey, you literally pinned him.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.530
You literally took him and
smushed him to the mat,

40:49.572 --> 40:52.617
and just took him like a rag
doll, and just pinned him.

40:52.658 --> 40:53.785
It was-- oh, it was great.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.246
Yeah, got the jump
on him, for sure.

40:57.414 --> 40:59.040
Yeah, you jumped on his neck.

41:00.666 --> 41:03.211
You were like, you
were like a legend.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.422
You still are.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.424
Good times.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.886
So, what made you
want to become a cop?

41:14.973 --> 41:16.724
All right.
You won't believe this.

41:19.769 --> 41:23.773
As you may recall, I was picked
on a lot when I was a kid.

41:25.733 --> 41:29.404
I was always a bigger
kid but never knew

41:29.446 --> 41:30.989
how to stand up for
myself, you know?

41:33.325 --> 41:36.828
One day it was
raining after school,

41:36.869 --> 41:42.625
and this whole group of kids
just started making fun of me.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.795
And started yelling at me,
calling me nasty names,

41:47.380 --> 41:51.550
putting mud all in my
hair, and it was terrible.

41:51.592 --> 41:53.094
I didn't know what to do.

41:55.138 --> 41:58.183
You know, I even think the
teachers knew about it.

41:59.476 --> 42:01.436
But they chose to
look the other way,

42:01.478 --> 42:05.023
because it was after
hours, and I guess

42:05.064 --> 42:06.607
those were just the times then.

42:08.485 --> 42:11.737
But then an older kid came
along and told everyone

42:11.779 --> 42:13.198
to knock it off,
leave me alone.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.452
And they did.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.745
I couldn't believe it.
It was incredible.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.837
My life really got
better after that.

42:31.090 --> 42:35.136
It was then that I realized a
single guy, only one person

42:35.178 --> 42:38.681
can make such an impact,
such a huge difference,
in someone else's life.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.599
You know?

42:40.641 --> 42:45.771
I was also at that
moment that I decided to do
the same for someone else.

42:48.191 --> 42:50.443
And that is why I became a cop.

42:51.528 --> 42:52.778
Cool, man.
Hey.

42:56.366 --> 42:57.867
That's cool.

42:57.909 --> 43:02.247
So, who was it that
stood up for you?

43:09.003 --> 43:10.046
It was you.

43:11.089 --> 43:11.923
Really?

43:12.965 --> 43:15.593
I have no recollection of that.

43:15.634 --> 43:16.886
Oh, but I do.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.763
You know, that's a
moment I'll never forget.

43:18.804 --> 43:19.847
I'll always remember that.

43:19.889 --> 43:21.140
Oh, that's funny, man.

43:24.436 --> 43:27.688
But enough about me.
How about you?
How did you become a soldier?

43:30.942 --> 43:35.696
You know, 9/11, we caught a
massive case of patriotism,

43:35.738 --> 43:38.866
and then joined up.

43:38.908 --> 43:41.035
Well, nothing wrong with that.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.371
I guess.

43:44.205 --> 43:45.123
So what'd you do?

43:46.165 --> 43:47.041
I--

43:47.083 --> 43:48.667
[clanging]

43:54.507 --> 44:00.472
I-- a little insurgence,
infantry,

44:02.723 --> 44:05.059
Fallujah.

44:05.101 --> 44:08.020
Straight up and down
dirtier than combat.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.522
Fallujah, huh?

44:10.940 --> 44:12.275
Yeah.

44:12.317 --> 44:16.613
That was some tough
stuff there, man.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.491
Nothing like being a cop here
in Crystal Lake,
that's for sure.

44:20.533 --> 44:21.367
Nope.

44:24.036 --> 44:27.206
Well, on behalf of myself

44:27.248 --> 44:30.918
and all the citizens of the
United States of America
then,

44:30.960 --> 44:36.924
I would like to thank you,
personally, for your selfless
and heroic service.

44:36.966 --> 44:38.092
Here you go.

44:38.134 --> 44:38.968
All right.

44:48.144 --> 44:49.895
Is that Mike Phillips?

44:49.937 --> 44:51.189
Mike Phillips.

44:51.939 --> 44:53.858
Hey Mike, it's me, Eric.

44:53.899 --> 44:54.817
Well, how are you doing?

44:54.859 --> 44:56.735
Eric, hey.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.946
What are you doing
back in town, man?

44:58.988 --> 45:00.739
Just getting the beer
my friend Bob, here.

45:00.781 --> 45:04.743
Oh cool.
How's it going though, man?
I heard you joined the Army.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.245
Yeah Marines, yeah.

45:06.287 --> 45:08.289
Same difference, as long as
they gave you a gun, right?

45:08.331 --> 45:10.082
They gave you a gun.

45:10.124 --> 45:13.461
Eric, every Marine has a rifle.

45:13.503 --> 45:15.547
But where were you
stationed, though?

45:15.588 --> 45:18.508
I was in Iraq.
Hey look, I'd rather not
talk about this stuff,

45:18.550 --> 45:19.800
tonight all right.

45:19.842 --> 45:21.594
I was chilling with
my friend Bob here.

45:21.636 --> 45:24.721
I totally understand, man--
war stories and all that stuff.

45:24.763 --> 45:26.098
I watch the news.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.684
Yeah, thanks man.

45:27.724 --> 45:29.852
Have a good one, all right?

45:29.894 --> 45:34.649
But is it true that they were
spraying white phosphorus
all over civilians over there?

45:34.691 --> 45:36.108
Have a good night, Eric.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.194
Oh, come on, man.

45:38.236 --> 45:42.323
I want to hear a real war
story from a real army vet.
That's stuff's awesome.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.701
Another time. Okay, Eric?

45:44.741 --> 45:46.827
Okay. Just tell me one thing.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.622
Did you kill anybody?

45:49.664 --> 45:50.831
[gunfire]

45:50.873 --> 45:52.083
But whoa!

45:52.124 --> 45:53.418
Little jumpy.

45:55.336 --> 45:57.171
Just tell me one thing, man.

45:59.215 --> 46:00.841
Did you see anybody get killed?

46:00.883 --> 46:01.800
[crashing]

46:01.842 --> 46:03.969
[screaming]

46:05.012 --> 46:06.305
Just shut up!

46:06.639 --> 46:09.475
Shut up!

46:09.517 --> 46:11.352
Shoot, you broke his face.

46:14.564 --> 46:15.398
Come on, let's go.

46:23.406 --> 46:26.242
[battlefield sounds]

46:53.645 --> 46:54.811
You're right.

46:54.853 --> 46:57.732
Okay, I've never been
in combat before.

46:57.774 --> 47:00.151
But I don't need to be a
killer to know what's right.

47:00.192 --> 47:01.736
You don't have to kill.

47:01.778 --> 47:05.072
But you have to be
under fire, and not run,

47:05.114 --> 47:08.409
and you have to put your life
on the line for something.

47:08.451 --> 47:11.579
And until then, you're nothing.

47:11.621 --> 47:15.249
And you haven't earned
me the respect to tell me
any thing about my life,

47:17.502 --> 47:19.378
or what I have done,

47:21.506 --> 47:23.174
or what I've seen.

47:26.469 --> 47:29.806
God doesn't care about us.

47:29.846 --> 47:34.519
There is a god, and he
doesn't care about us.

47:34.560 --> 47:35.436
Yes he does.

47:35.478 --> 47:36.312
No!

47:38.815 --> 47:39.649
No.

47:43.778 --> 47:45.070
[crying]

47:45.112 --> 47:48.700
If you had seen the
things I've seen,

47:49.908 --> 47:54.955
you would know that
God is evil.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.126
He's evil.

48:01.838 --> 48:03.088
War is hell, man.

48:03.130 --> 48:06.718
I don't even pretend
to understand it.

48:08.344 --> 48:10.929
But God is showing you
those things for a reason.

48:10.971 --> 48:11.806
No.

48:13.808 --> 48:17.102
There is no reason.

48:17.144 --> 48:18.020
Yes, Mike.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.146
There is a reason.

48:20.732 --> 48:22.274
You just don't
understand it yet.

48:25.444 --> 48:27.946
There is a reason
for everything.

48:28.781 --> 48:30.157
Trust in Him.

48:30.199 --> 48:31.409
Keep the faith.

48:32.869 --> 48:34.620
Semper fidelis, remember?

48:34.995 --> 48:37.707
Go away.

48:41.544 --> 48:44.380
I know you've seen hard things.
I know you've done hard things.

48:46.841 --> 48:47.842
But God will forgive you.

48:47.884 --> 48:51.053
Just go away.

48:52.680 --> 48:53.514
Please.

48:55.015 --> 48:58.519
Just go away.

49:00.479 --> 49:01.355
Go away.

49:16.537 --> 49:18.372
[man] <i> Who would want to</i>
<i>praise God?</i>

49:22.376 --> 49:23.210
<i>Sin.</i>

49:27.381 --> 49:29.091
<i>It's like I'm made of it.</i>

49:31.135 --> 49:32.804
<i>I cherish that life.</i>

49:35.055 --> 49:38.893
<i>In my heart of</i>
<i>hearts, I cherish it.</i>

49:45.065 --> 49:47.067
<i>How could I ever,</i>

49:47.109 --> 49:51.697
<i>truly praise God and be</i>
<i>anything other than a fraud?</i>

49:56.993 --> 49:58.621
<i>How could He love</i>
<i>someone like me?</i>

50:02.750 --> 50:08.923
<i>I mean, he's just a myth,</i>
<i>right?</i>

50:12.384 --> 50:13.218
<i>Am I right?</i>

50:26.732 --> 50:29.318
<i>What if we weren't</i>
<i>who we think we are?</i>

50:30.778 --> 50:32.780
<i>What if our entire</i>
<i>life,</i>

50:32.822 --> 50:36.993
<i>we thought about</i>

<i>and then we found out</i>

50:37.033 --> 50:38.410
<i>that everything around us--</i>

50:40.162 --> 50:45.417
<i>the whole universe, was</i>
<i>something else, entirely.</i>

50:48.963 --> 50:51.007
<i>Or what if your life was a lie?</i>

50:53.300 --> 50:57.513
<i>What would it be like</i>
<i>to awaken from the lie?</i>

50:57.555 --> 51:02.518

51:04.102 --> 51:08.900
<i>And that right there, God</i>

51:12.068 --> 51:16.448
All you needed to do was
just hold out your hand.

51:21.203 --> 51:27.251
<i>Or is it just an infinite</i>
<i>void of nothingness?</i>

51:41.891 --> 51:44.643
[knocking]

51:46.854 --> 51:49.189
Hey, Dean-o, I heard
you were missing.

51:49.231 --> 51:50.148
Are you all right?

51:52.068 --> 51:52.985
Uh-huh.

51:53.027 --> 51:53.945
Are you sure?

51:55.696 --> 51:56.864
Uh-huh.

51:57.823 --> 51:58.991
May I come in?

52:02.411 --> 52:03.287
Come on, quick.

52:22.765 --> 52:24.516
Love what you've
done with the place.

52:28.104 --> 52:29.688
Uh-huh.

52:29.730 --> 52:30.773
Where are your parents?

52:34.944 --> 52:41.826
Well, my mom is in
Cancun for the next week.

52:41.867 --> 52:46.080
If she had to cut her vacation
short just because of me,
she'd be mad for the next year.

52:52.544 --> 52:53.754
What about your--

52:53.796 --> 52:55.213
My dad's in Germany.

52:55.255 --> 52:57.967
I've only met him a few times.

52:59.844 --> 53:01.846
I'm sorry, man.

53:01.887 --> 53:05.808
If you ever want a place
to crash, mine's available.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.147
Really?

53:11.187 --> 53:12.940
Yeah, my dad would
be cool with that.

53:13.941 --> 53:15.400
Hey thanks, man.

53:15.442 --> 53:16.944
No problem.

53:16.986 --> 53:17.820
Are you hungry?

53:21.824 --> 53:23.367
Get your stuff. Let's go.

53:32.710 --> 53:36.088
Hey, man.
I'm really sorry what
we did to you before.

53:36.130 --> 53:38.841
That just-- really wasn't cool.

53:41.635 --> 53:42.511
Thanks, man.

53:49.601 --> 53:52.312
We should probably
get you a lawyer, too.

53:52.354 --> 53:54.773
Hey man you're cool,
like really cool.

53:55.524 --> 53:57.151
You too.

53:57.193 --> 53:59.945
That thing you did for Kayla--
you really saved her life.

53:59.987 --> 54:02.031
You just really knew
what to do.

54:02.614 --> 54:03.448
I try.

54:04.700 --> 54:06.660
I mean, why are
you doing all this?

54:06.702 --> 54:09.245
After all I've done to
you, you should hate me.

54:10.206 --> 54:11.498
I don't hate anyone.

54:12.833 --> 54:15.502
Well that's cool if you
can just let it slide.

54:15.544 --> 54:18.130
I don't let it slide,
I just do the opposite.

54:18.172 --> 54:19.506
Opposite?

54:19.548 --> 54:20.674
The opposite.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.676
We live in a
paradoxical universe.

54:22.718 --> 54:24.762
The most potent weapon
we have is love.

54:25.512 --> 54:27.098
Love your enemy?

54:27.139 --> 54:28.348
Turn the other cheek?

54:29.183 --> 54:30.935
Logic is overrated.

54:30.976 --> 54:33.395
I believe in something higher.

54:33.437 --> 54:35.898
What-- God, Buddha, aliens?

54:38.025 --> 54:38.859
The soul.

54:42.113 --> 54:44.615
Contradictions are okay in
a paradoxical universe.

54:53.415 --> 54:58.170
Is it the world that's
contradictory, or is it
our inability to understand it?

54:58.212 --> 54:59.130
That's right.

54:59.171 --> 55:00.505
We can't know God's reasons.

55:00.547 --> 55:01.840
That's why it's called faith.

55:02.133 --> 55:03.675
Oh.

55:05.261 --> 55:07.972
When looked at that way, the
world starts to make sense.

55:11.349 --> 55:13.769
You're really religious.
You believe in miracles?

55:14.728 --> 55:16.147
I believe in unmiracles.

55:17.564 --> 55:18.983
What's an unmiracle?

55:20.734 --> 55:23.195
It's the opposite of
what you expect from God.

55:23.237 --> 55:25.197
Like, when something
horrible happens,

55:25.239 --> 55:27.699
and you wonder how God
could let that occur.

55:27.741 --> 55:30.828
It seems like He's
against you, but He's not.

55:30.869 --> 55:33.205
It's you who's against God.

55:33.247 --> 55:36.917
Once you realize that, the
unmiracle becomes a miracle.

55:36.959 --> 55:39.753
It's just that you were
looking at life upside down.

55:39.795 --> 55:42.589
Man, that's dope!
Are you high?

55:42.631 --> 55:45.676
No. If you come to my house,
you've got to be straight,
okay?

55:45.717 --> 55:48.344
Straight's a dirty word,
man, I'll never be straight.

55:48.386 --> 55:49.554
All right.

55:49.596 --> 55:50.931
If you come to my house,
you got to be clean.

55:50.973 --> 55:53.934
All right. I can be clean.
I'd be happy to do that.

56:00.398 --> 56:02.026
Come on, Dean-o.
Let's go.

56:02.067 --> 56:03.277
Hey, Arin.

56:03.319 --> 56:04.611
Yeah?

56:04.653 --> 56:05.487
Thanks.

56:30.971 --> 56:34.016
Karen Stevenson.

56:35.142 --> 56:38.979
We haven't seen you
at church in ages.

56:39.021 --> 56:41.397
Cheri, hi.

56:41.439 --> 56:43.150
I know.

56:43.192 --> 56:47.279
It's been a long time.
I've just been a little busy.

56:47.321 --> 56:48.572
I've really missed you guys.

56:50.866 --> 56:53.952
You don't have to
pretend with me, sugar.

56:53.994 --> 56:56.747
I've seen it all 10 times over.

56:56.788 --> 56:59.415
And you can't put
one past me, darling.

57:02.961 --> 57:04.504
It's come back, hasn't it?

57:07.632 --> 57:09.843
I don't have any money.

57:09.885 --> 57:12.137
My daughter's in the hospital.

57:13.347 --> 57:14.639
Cassie?

57:14.932 --> 57:15.807
No.

57:16.474 --> 57:17.642
Kayla.

57:17.684 --> 57:18.977
Your baby?

57:19.686 --> 57:20.812
Oh Lord.

57:21.521 --> 57:22.981
You have to trust Him.

57:24.233 --> 57:27.819
I just can't handle this life.

57:27.861 --> 57:34.159
I prayed to God to watch over
my baby, and she's in a coma.

57:34.201 --> 57:38.622
I prayed to God for a long,
happy life, and I got cancer.

57:40.082 --> 57:42.876
I prayed to God for
a loving family,

57:43.961 --> 57:45.837
and my husband divorced me.

57:46.922 --> 57:48.840
You have to put your
trust in the Lord.

57:48.882 --> 57:49.758
It doesn't work.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.260
I know it's hard.

57:52.261 --> 57:53.845
I tried.

57:55.472 --> 57:56.307
I can't.

57:57.933 --> 58:01.561
This is just a test.

58:01.603 --> 58:04.148
You have to trust Him.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.690
I understand that.

58:06.150 --> 58:07.692
I really do.

58:09.236 --> 58:12.281
I just don't understand it.

58:14.616 --> 58:17.035
You can't be distracted
by this world.

58:18.454 --> 58:22.082
One day, this body
will be gone.

58:23.417 --> 58:26.670
But the spirit never dies.

58:26.711 --> 58:29.214
This is what Jesus
is offering--

58:29.923 --> 58:31.383
everlasting peace.

58:33.802 --> 58:38.556
You get your soul straight
first, and that flesh?

58:39.683 --> 58:40.851
It will follow.

58:44.896 --> 58:47.024
We live in a fallen world.

58:48.400 --> 58:52.363
It was the price we paid
for the freedom to choose.

58:53.489 --> 58:56.616
Yes, God created this world.

58:57.617 --> 59:00.204
But then He stepped away.

59:00.245 --> 59:04.833
And He won't interfere,
but He will remind you

59:04.875 --> 59:06.626
that he loves you.

59:07.669 --> 59:09.629
And that he's with you.

59:11.215 --> 59:13.384
He's doing it all the time.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.638
And for the few
who can see that,

59:20.598 --> 59:25.229
they live in a state of grace.

59:26.646 --> 59:28.732
I think I see it.

59:30.817 --> 59:36.073
A state of grace that
can never be destroyed.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.827
Grace.

59:40.869 --> 59:42.829
Praise God.

59:42.871 --> 59:44.831
Amazing grace.

59:45.874 --> 59:48.335
His grace is sufficient.

59:48.835 --> 59:51.129
Trust Him.

59:51.171 --> 59:54.758
He loves you, and I do too.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.680
God bless you, baby.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:08.063
That's it. We're done.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:11.233
Next time you want
to talk to my client,
make sure counsel's present.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:12.568
Let's go.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.204
[door closes]

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.045
[slams table]

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:41.513
You know that voice in
the back of your head?

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:43.515
The one that always
whispers to you?

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:46.518
Yeah.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.980
The one that always
speaks truth?

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:52.857
Yeah.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.568
You know who that is,
don't you?

01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:00.282
Who?

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:02.618
Say it.

01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:10.167
I can't.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:11.751
Yes you can.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:12.628
Say it.

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:21.261
Why can't I--

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:22.929
You can. Do it.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:26.517
This is so weird.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:27.684
Do it.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.276
Jesus.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:38.403
Right on.

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:41.490
Jesus.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:44.660
Jesus.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.163
[both] Jesus.

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:06.181
[phone ringing]

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:11.102
[Arin] <i> Hey Danny, what's up?</i>

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:12.479
Hey Arin.

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:16.107
Have you seen Dean-o?

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:17.442
[Arin] <i> Dean-o?</i>

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:18.485
Yeah.

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:19.944
[Arin] <i> Yeah.</i>

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.364
Stiletto really
needs to see him.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.242
[Arin] <i> I don't think</i>
<i>that's a good idea.</i>

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:28.203
Do you think you could
have him meet us?

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.664
[Arin] <i> Where?</i>

01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:31.748
[Danny] <i> He's not a narc!</i>

01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:33.417
<i>Dean-o's staying with him.</i>

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.960
<i>If he would have narced, they</i>
<i>would have taken him already.</i>

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:38.213
<i>Who's to say that he</i>
<i>didn't already, Danny?</i>

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:40.340
<i>They're letting him stay at</i>
<i>little man's as a halfway narc</i>

01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.008
house until they
prep their case.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.343
Come on, dude.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:44.469
Think about it.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:46.555
Kid's a narc.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.517
[knocking]

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:53.019
Did you hear something?

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:54.771
Yeah.

01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:55.647
Kill the lights.

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:01.612
[footsteps]

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:03.863
[door opens]

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:04.740
Arin?

01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:08.493
What are you doing here?

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.036
Where is Dean-o?

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:11.496
He's not coming.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:12.830
And why's that?

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:14.458
Because I didn't tell him.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:17.335
He's clean now, and he doesn't
need you messing him up.

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:19.504
You're such a hero.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:23.717
I'm really you're here,
because I know that you
were the one that narced on me.

01:03:23.759 --> 01:03:25.469
No, I really didn't.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:29.306
Really? Because they
questioned me for hours
about Kayla Stevenson.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:32.350
Now, why would they do
something like that?

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:33.977
So you just assume it was me?

01:03:34.018 --> 01:03:35.479
No, I know it was you.

01:03:36.438 --> 01:03:38.189
[knife flicks open]

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:39.566
Stiletto, chill.

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.735
Shut up, Abercrombie,
or you're next.

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:45.196
Half of the school saw you
snorting Ye at Dino's house.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:46.698
Maybe it was somebody else.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.408
You know you got a big
mouth for such a little man.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:49.826
And a small brain.

01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:50.994
It's probably all
that religious stuff.

01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:53.913
It's just mind control.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.248
No, it's really not.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:57.334
All of you.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.252
You people are all brainwashed.

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.254
So you're telling me that
some farmer from China,

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:04.758
or some Native American
from 400 years ago,

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.552
is going to go to hell because
he's never heard of Jesus?

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:08.595
I'm sorry.

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:10.263
That's not a loving God.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.015
It's all just stories
they tell the people

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:15.935
to enforce social propagandas
and to subjugate the meek.

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.938
In the end, they just don't
want to know what the truth is,

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.691
because you know why?

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:23.568
Because the truth
is just too scary.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.945
Yeah, and what is it?

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.739
What's the real truth,
Stiletto?

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.660
We're all alone, and
that's the truth.

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:33.537
But I'm not alone.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.079
Yes you are.

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:37.123
The truth of life
is brutal, man.

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:39.042
Man is an apex predator.

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:44.464
The strong take, and the weak
pray for everlasting paradise
after death.

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:45.882
You're alone.

01:04:45.923 --> 01:04:47.050
We're all alone.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:48.552
I'm not alone.

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:56.309
Mike?

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:57.310
What are you doing here?

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:58.729
Hey, Mike.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:00.856
Michael Phillips.

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:02.733
Wow.

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:06.403
So you're hanging with
the kinder now, huh?

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.405
Melvin.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:11.449
You know, I always thought
you were a little funny.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.619
But what's this you were
saying about apex predator?

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.664
I mean I just thought--

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:19.999
you've seen the most reality--

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:21.752
I mean, more than all of us.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:23.169
So you know what I mean?

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:24.462
Yeah.

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:26.256
And if you'd been to war
with real soldiers

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:29.676
who had your back, you'd
know one thing, Melvin.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:31.887
We're not alone.

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:34.180
Stay back.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:43.523
All you care about is yourself.

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.983
And you think that makes
you strong, but it doesn't.

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.527
It makes you weak.

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:49.195
You're weak.

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:50.864
You're a parasite.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.658
You know what?

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.911
If you think I'm wrong,
go ahead and prove it.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:01.249
Come on, hotshot.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.835
First shot's free. Right there.
Go ahead.

01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:12.761
That's what I thought.

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:14.679
I'll see you later, Melvin.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.815
[door opens and closes]

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:27.233
And if I ever catch you hanging
around my little brother

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:28.276
Danny--

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.737
who's in high school--

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:34.407
I'm going to show you firsthand
how brutal the apex predator
really can be.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:48.171
I don't know what's
going on here, Danny,

01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:50.089
but you need to tell me
exactly what's happening.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:58.014
It's about Kayla.

01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:01.058
What about her?

01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:04.521
She OD'ed.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:06.857
When?

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.066
That party.

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:11.987
The one you said
that went fine?

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:14.405
Yeah.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:19.076
And?

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:23.331
And she's my girlfriend, and
Stiletto gave her the drugs.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:27.168
And how does this
involve you, Danny?

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:29.796
She's in a coma.

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:36.052
Why are you hanging out
with this guy, then?

01:07:36.093 --> 01:07:39.389
Why are you hanging out with
some coke head who's waving
a knife in your face, Danny?

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.059
Are you dealing drugs?

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:48.815
What did Arin tell you?

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.441
I don't know what's
going on here, Danny,

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.318
but you need to tell me.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.696
If Kayla doesn't make
it, it's homicide.

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.658
Why do you care about
Melvin Johnson, then?

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.493
Because I gave her drugs, too.

01:08:04.288 --> 01:08:06.082
What drugs did you
give her, Danny?

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:09.753
Your pills.

01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:12.756
I took some from your kitchen.

01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:16.341
You stole my pills?

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:23.224
You stole my pills, Danny?

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:28.645
And now you're up for homicide
for your girlfriend possibly?

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:31.524
What's the matter
with you, Danny?

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:34.027
You're supposed to
tell me this stuff.

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:35.569
I'm your brother.
I'm here for you.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.196
No you're not.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.948
You say that you
are, but you're not.

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.700
You never come to dinner.

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:43.368
You sleep all day, and
you drink all night.
You're an alcoholic.

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.955
Shut up, Danny.
Shut up.

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.372
You know what?
Every time I come over,
you try to kill me.

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:48.332
Just shut up!

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:49.332
You're crazy, Mile.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.334
You want to hit me?

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.669
You want to hit me?
Go ahead.

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:53.087
Huh?
Huh?

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.714
Huh?
Why don't you stand
up for yourself, huh?

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:56.049
Huh?
Huh?

01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:57.968
Stand up for yourself!

01:08:58.009 --> 01:08:59.260
Stop!

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.763
I taught you better
than this, Danny.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:04.265
I taught you better than this.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:07.225
And now you're stealing
from me and lying?

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:10.313
I taught you integrity.
I taught you Marine honor.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:12.189
I'm not a Marine, Mike.

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.442
I'm not you.
I don't care about
Marine honor.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.401
I'm a regular guy.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:16.819
No, you're not.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:18.194
Yes, I am.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.906
You're the war hero, Mike.

01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:23.367
You're the high
school superstar.
You're the sports legend.

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:25.912
I'm regular.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.497
No, you're not.

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:28.790
You're better than that, Danny.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.041
Yes I am.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:31.876
And I'm cool with it.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:36.089
Do you know how long
I tried to live up
to being your little brother?

01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:37.841
Do you know how
hard that is, Mike?

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.051
I'm done.

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.511
I don't care anymore.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.889
I just want to be me.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.975
All right.
Who is you, Danny?

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.769
What do you stand for?

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.191
I guess I just stand
for myself.

You're really gonna go

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:21.425
He's a kid.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.887
His parents are out of town,

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:25.889
But sarge, we don't
have a warrant.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.142
Are you going to back

We're coming in.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.160
Do you have a warrant?

01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:48.661
I don't need a warrant.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:49.787
We're here for Dean Jones.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.414
I saw him in the window.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:57.670
You can't come in here
without a warrant, Officer.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.672
Kid.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:00.882
I don't need a warrant.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:03.259
Now you going to let me in?

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.761
Or do I have to drag
you in too?

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:06.429
For what?

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:07.680
Asserting my rights?

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.767
Come back with a warrant.

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:15.521
You are housing a known
drug dealer, who gave drugs

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:18.024
to a minor, who almost died.

01:11:18.066 --> 01:11:21.236
Look, I can assure
you Dean's clean.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.613
There's no drug dealing
going on in my house.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.490
Heroin, Arin.

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.785
He gave her heroin.

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:30.787
That's a felony.
We're coming in.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:32.747
I know what it was.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.041
He didn't give it to her.

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:36.459
I did.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.003
If you're going to
arrest anyone, arrest me.

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:40.838
But you can't, can you?

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:44.675
I was the one who called 911.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:49.430
Under the law, you can't
arrest somebody for drugs

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:52.558
if they were the one who
called 911 for an OD.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.978
I was the one who
gave her the drugs.

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.147
I was the one
who made the call.

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:58.439
You can't arrest me.

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:12.578
Isn't that a lie?

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.371
Bearing false witness
against your neighbor

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:16.373
is a lot different from
bearing false witness

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:18.251
to protect your neighbor.

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:20.170
I don't think that's gonna fly.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:24.590
Maybe not, but somebody had
to prove Stiletto wrong.

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:29.345
I mean, we're not all alone.
And we're not here
for ourselves.

01:12:29.386 --> 01:12:31.097
Besides, it's not a lie.

01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:33.516
You gave the heroin to me,
and I gave it to Kayla.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:37.937
The Lord does work
in mysterious ways.

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:41.398
You can say that again, but
don't worry about it, man.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.985
I mean, that's between
me and my maker.

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:45.945
He'll forgive me.

01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:47.113

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:44.962
What happened?

01:14:07.484 --> 01:14:09.445
Arin said that you
can get me clean?

01:14:11.488 --> 01:14:13.283
No one can do that, Dean-o.

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:14.658
I'm sorry, not even you.

01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:17.287
What?

01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:19.914
As addicts, we must admit
that we are addicts.

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.666
It's not about lack of will.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.669
It's just that we're
predisposed to the drug
of our choice.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:28.839
See, the first step is to
admit that we have an addiction

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.384
and that we are powerless
against that addiction.

01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:32.468
Well, I'm addicted all right.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:41.894
I can't stop.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:44.605
I've tried my hardest.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:46.649
I can't.

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:49.319
Well I've been there, too.

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:55.741
That's-- it's a
feeling you know.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:57.118
It's not the truth.

01:14:58.619 --> 01:15:01.705
You can stop, you just have
to engage your higher power.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:03.749
Higher power?

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:06.502
Some people call it God.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:09.255
Look.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:15.136
You can't do this
alone and

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.972
God will help you get through
the day without using.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.933
Just one day at a time, right?

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.352
That's it.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:23.519
One day at a time.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.647
God will help you
if you let Him.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:33.570
Before this week, I never
thought about God once.

01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:40.119
We tend to look to
God in rough times.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:45.208
To get us through life when
life is at its most difficult.

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:48.836
Some people think that
God tests us just so
we turn toward him.

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:54.425
Arin said God makes
bad things into good.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:56.969
Yes, the unmiracle.

I cannot believe I'm having
this conversation right now.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:06.020
This has been the weirdest
week in my entire life.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:08.314
If you had told me when
I was your age, that I'd

01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:11.442
be here doing this now,
pastor in a church,

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:13.777
I would've laughed.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:16.989
I was wild, I was
a user, and I loved
every single minute of it.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:23.079
But May 18, 1987, I
woke up in a jail cell.

01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:34.798

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:40.179
Why'd it take
something like this
to bring our family together?

01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:44.100
It's the unmiracle.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:47.686
What's that?

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:51.524
It's just something someone
very wise once told me.

01:16:51.566 --> 01:16:52.608
No, what's that?

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:54.651
Oh.

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:01.617
When Kayla went into the
hospital the first time,

01:17:01.658 --> 01:17:06.830
I bought her this watch as a
symbol of her mother's love.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:08.958
And I found it in her
drawer this morning.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.668
It stopped.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:14.088
Mom, don't worry.
We can fix it.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.590
I don't have any money.

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:17.383
$70.

01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:19.385
Well, that's more
than it's worth.

01:17:20.595 --> 01:17:22.846
God will fix it.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.475
So Kayla knows that I
will always love her.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:28.685
If we just pray about it.

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:34.691

Mom, are you sure?

01:17:37.487 --> 01:17:39.071
I started chemo last week.

01:17:43.951 --> 01:17:45.869
Would it be okay if I
stayed here for a time?

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.501
That would be wonderful.

01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:53.419
