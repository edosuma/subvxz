<i>At the end of the Ice Age,</i>
<i>the Machine came.</i>

00:07.149 --> 00:10.345
<i>It came from outside.</i>
<i>It came from space.</i>

00:11.310 --> 00:12.968
<i>It came with one purpose...</i>

00:13.582 --> 00:16.070
<i>to change Man into Mutant.</i>

01:18.031 --> 01:19.853
<i>After much suffering and death...</i>

01:20.175 --> 01:22.280
<i>a warrior named Neachdainn...</i>

01:22.608 --> 01:24.712
<i>united the ancient tribes of Man.</i>

01:26.223 --> 01:30.762
<i>Together, they sealed the deadly</i>
<i>Machine beneath the earth.</i>

01:49.551 --> 01:51.460
<i>In the distant mountains</i>
<i>of eastern Europe...</i>

01:51.664 --> 01:54.599
<i>only The Brotherhood,</i>
<i>descendants of Neachdainn...</i>

01:54.864 --> 01:57.384
<i>kept knowledge of</i>
<i>the Machine alive...</i>

01:57.776 --> 02:02.511
<i>in stories, in myths, in the</i>
<i>sacred book of The Chronicles.</i>

02:08.143 --> 02:12.683
<i>Years later, four Corporations</i>
<i>ruled the world.</i>

02:13.359 --> 02:14.766
<i>Mishima in the East...</i>

02:15.440 --> 02:17.993
<i>Bauhaus and Imperial</i>
<i>in Europe and Africa...</i>

02:18.896 --> 02:20.784
<i>Capitol in the West.</i>

02:22.256 --> 02:24.493
<i>Each Corporation fights each other...</i>

02:24.944 --> 02:29.199
<i>for what little resources</i>
<i>remain in a war without end.</i>

02:31.568 --> 02:33.357
<i>On the muddy planes of Europe...</i>

02:33.712 --> 02:35.654
<i>the Bauhaus Corporation prepares...</i>

02:35.664 --> 02:37.933
<i>for another assault</i>
<i>on the Capitol lines.</i>

02:38.672 --> 02:44.074
<i>Between them, beneath them,</i>
<i>the Machine still waits.</i>

02:48.049 --> 02:49.903
Keep it up, lads, put a smile on it.

02:50.545 --> 02:54.090
Will you put that
fucking cigarette out!

02:56.625 --> 03:00.454
Alright, you Bauhaus bastards,
what's on today's menu of shit?

03:07.089 --> 03:08.878
Incoming!

03:09.169 --> 03:10.762
Get your lid on, son.

03:10.961 --> 03:12.335
Tuck in! Tuck in!

03:18.385 --> 03:19.432
Keep your heads down.

03:21.713 --> 03:22.661
Enjoy!

03:29.074 --> 03:31.310
Don't pick at it, son.
It makes it worse.

03:35.185 --> 03:36.527
Fucking hell.

03:41.202 --> 03:42.925
All the fun of the fair, eh?

03:47.793 --> 03:49.616
I want you to destroy them!

03:50.481 --> 03:51.976
You will now fight!

03:52.594 --> 03:54.568
I want to see only ashes remaining!

03:56.690 --> 03:58.119
Advance!

04:11.858 --> 04:13.287
Is Hunter's patrol back yet?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.474
What's left... sir.

04:29.746 --> 04:31.372
More pressure on the exit wound.

04:57.587 --> 04:58.602
What happened?

04:58.771 --> 05:00.876
Ran into cog armour
five klicks back.

05:00.883 --> 05:03.152
- How strong?
- Five ATCs.

05:03.506 --> 05:04.586
Shit, a full platoon.

05:04.755 --> 05:06.381
We left them bogged
down in the wire.

05:06.387 --> 05:08.940
They called in our position, ran
eight-eighties right up our ass...

05:09.139 --> 05:11.244
Once they get through this wire,
they'll be right on top of us.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.997
- Just another day.
- Right, fucking on top of us.

05:22.771 --> 05:24.495
Shit, here they come.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.020
I guess dead men don't smoke, huh?

05:39.764 --> 05:43.178
Gracias, Padre. I feel
all cleansed and shit.

05:45.492 --> 05:47.379
Sergeant? Would you receive grace?

05:48.052 --> 05:49.426
Top's going straight to hell.

05:49.876 --> 05:52.145
You know your Top
used to be an officer.

05:52.948 --> 05:54.192
A klick and closing, lads.

05:54.452 --> 05:56.590
That's right. We went through
the Academy and everything.

05:57.331 --> 05:58.640
They're nearly with us, lads.

06:03.220 --> 06:04.529
Then one morning he woke up...

06:05.780 --> 06:09.162
with an extremely nasty case
of, 'I don't give a fuck'.

06:10.292 --> 06:13.641
A fuck about what?
Every yard we take...

06:13.652 --> 06:17.034
every Cog we kill, some fat
fuck's stock goes up two points.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.560
But it's not about
the money, is it, Sarge?

06:20.788 --> 06:22.599
Ends up where they give
cash bonuses to officers...

06:22.612 --> 06:24.107
based on body count.

06:26.132 --> 06:27.376
Sometimes, I think
you don't believe...

06:27.381 --> 06:30.316
in the righteousness of our
mighty Corporation, Sergeant.

06:31.957 --> 06:33.451
They don't pay me to believe, sir.

06:34.549 --> 06:35.759
Absolutely right.

06:36.373 --> 06:39.373
They pay you to fuck shit up.

06:45.653 --> 06:46.546
Down!

06:51.989 --> 06:54.095
Right, ladies...
this is it, let's get to it.

06:54.102 --> 06:55.214
Up you get! Up you get!

06:56.438 --> 06:57.747
Step to it, boys.

06:58.389 --> 06:59.218
Now!

07:19.157 --> 07:22.704
Come on, ladies. I want you to
show those Cogs your war face.

07:22.997 --> 07:24.208
Come on, lads, step to it.

07:24.853 --> 07:25.835
Lock and load.

07:32.214 --> 07:33.294
Come on, Chita.

07:33.782 --> 07:36.084
Easy, lads, wait for it.

07:39.030 --> 07:40.274
Easy.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.152
Let them have it, lads.

08:18.743 --> 08:20.237
Incoming!

08:21.302 --> 08:22.546
Gas!

08:23.895 --> 08:26.764
Masks on now! Come on!

09:16.919 --> 09:17.999
Fuck!

09:19.864 --> 09:21.424
For a second, I thought
you were going to shoot me.

09:22.071 --> 09:26.195
For a second I was. If I don't make it
out of here, you look after the girls.

09:27.896 --> 09:29.489
Can't I just buy you a drink?

09:45.816 --> 09:47.671
I can't get through to
Betty and Marilyn's fucked.

09:47.832 --> 09:50.288
Take Mary Jane and link
up with Slick Nancy. Go!

09:58.777 --> 10:00.783
You keep that fucking
bonnet on, soldier!

11:03.834 --> 11:05.556
Our soldiers didn't do this.

11:38.010 --> 11:40.498
Fuck, they're in pieces.

11:42.075 --> 11:43.318
Motherfuckers.

11:58.714 --> 12:01.234
Jesus, God Almighty, Christ!

12:15.164 --> 12:16.440
Murderer!

12:33.532 --> 12:34.611
Put down your weapons!

12:35.420 --> 12:37.111
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

12:37.276 --> 12:38.453
Has war driven you mad?

12:38.619 --> 12:39.797
My men didn't do this.

12:40.091 --> 12:42.131
- So, you accuse me?
- Yeah.

12:49.628 --> 12:50.610
What was that?

12:52.123 --> 12:53.105
What is that?

12:59.325 --> 13:00.011
Get down!

13:00.028 --> 13:01.140
Come on, get the fuck out of here!

13:04.156 --> 13:07.985
Need back-up. 1047, I repeat, 1047...

13:12.061 --> 13:13.009
I'm out!

13:23.036 --> 13:25.457
Motherfuckers! My leg!

13:25.788 --> 13:27.349
Oh, shit my fucking leg!

13:35.325 --> 13:36.819
Nate! Nate!

13:38.652 --> 13:39.929
I'm right behind you!

13:40.797 --> 13:41.779
Nate!

13:42.844 --> 13:43.826
Come on, then!

13:47.132 --> 13:48.179
See ya!

13:49.629 --> 13:50.774
Come on, then.

13:51.452 --> 13:53.558
Come on! Nate!

13:56.636 --> 13:58.360
Ammo's out! Come on.

14:11.965 --> 14:13.875
- You're not going back!
- Nate!

14:16.382 --> 14:17.275
Had enough?

14:23.966 --> 14:26.813
Come on, you fucking beauties.

14:27.709 --> 14:28.919
Come on, now, let's have ya!

14:29.822 --> 14:30.804
Where's everybody else?

14:31.485 --> 14:32.762
There's nobody else!

14:32.989 --> 14:33.851
Let's go!

14:35.805 --> 14:40.061
Nate? Nate!

14:40.892 --> 14:42.551
Go!

16:55.424 --> 16:58.720
<i>Before the first dawn,</i>
<i>there was a battle in Heaven.</i>

17:00.448 --> 17:02.588
<i>The Enemy was cast out</i>
<i>and fell to Earth...</i>

17:03.232 --> 17:04.791
<i>an evil star...</i>

17:05.568 --> 17:07.805
<i>broken in body but not in pride...</i>

17:09.121 --> 17:11.160
<i>consumed by envy and hate...</i>

17:12.544 --> 17:15.992
<i>it conspired to remake</i>
<i>man in its own image.</i>

17:16.833 --> 17:19.036
<i>And thus the enemy</i>
<i>created a machine.</i>

17:21.184 --> 17:23.770
<i>A machine that stripped the</i>
<i>souls from the dead and dying...</i>

17:24.000 --> 17:27.775
and replaced them with
its own dark essence...

17:29.473 --> 17:32.320
Neachdainn, founder of our Order...

17:33.504 --> 17:35.773
assembled the ancient tribes of man.

17:36.673 --> 17:39.575
<i>Together, they defeated the enemy...</i>

17:40.225 --> 17:43.520
<i>and sealed his machine</i>
<i>beneath the Earth.</i>

17:49.185 --> 17:52.316
<i>The war has broken the Great Seal</i>
<i>and awoken the Machine.</i>

18:05.089 --> 18:09.279
<i>Released from their prison</i>
<i>the mutants dragged every body...</i>

18:09.281 --> 18:11.703
<i>to the pit where the</i>
<i>Great Seal once lay...</i>

18:12.865 --> 18:14.873
<i>and deep beneath the ground...</i>

18:15.266 --> 18:18.113
<i>the gears of the Machine</i>
<i>began to turn again.</i>

18:19.202 --> 18:21.057
<i>Changing the dead and the dying.</i>

18:21.953 --> 18:24.987
<i>Mutating them into</i>
<i>the enemies of Man.</i>

18:49.987 --> 18:53.336
<i>Even the power of the four</i>
<i>Corporations couldn't stop them.</i>

18:57.411 --> 19:00.062
<i>The Chronicles promised us</i>
<i>that one would rise...</i>

19:00.066 --> 19:03.481
<i>and follow the path of Neachdainn,</i>
<i>down into hell itself...</i>

19:04.035 --> 19:06.883
<i>and deliver Mankind from oblivion.</i>

19:07.203 --> 19:08.959
<i>I travelled to</i>
<i>see the Corporations...</i>

19:09.443 --> 19:12.094
<i>to plead with them</i>
<i>to fulfil the Prophecy...</i>

19:12.227 --> 19:14.780
<i>and defeat the enemy of Man.</i>

19:36.932 --> 19:39.299
How much time do we have?

19:40.100 --> 19:42.239
Days. Less, maybe.

19:43.332 --> 19:45.120
Begin the evacuation.

19:45.796 --> 19:47.072
Evacuation?

19:49.667 --> 19:53.857
Move the key personnel
to off world colonies...

19:54.339 --> 19:57.689
and then we can
reassess our situation.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.028
Am I to understand that
you would abandon the Earth?

20:01.667 --> 20:04.351
Yes, Brother. You understand well.

20:06.020 --> 20:07.580
We are finished here.

20:07.876 --> 20:09.818
And even with all your ships...

20:10.564 --> 20:13.117
how many millions do you
think you'll leave behind?

20:14.212 --> 20:17.408
And do you think that the Enemy
will stop at this world? They won't.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.261
They'll follow you.

20:21.059 --> 20:23.002
They will follow you
no matter where you run.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.781
There is still hope!

20:34.404 --> 20:36.292
- What hope?
- Fulfil the Chronicles!

20:37.060 --> 20:38.816
Give me 20 soldiers and a ship!

20:38.980 --> 20:42.657
And what can these twenty do
that our armies could not?

20:42.820 --> 20:45.024
They can go where an army cannot.

20:45.029 --> 20:48.193
They can go down into the earth.
They can destroy the Machine.

20:51.973 --> 20:55.234
I know what you must be thinking.
You men of science, of commerce.

20:55.973 --> 20:57.533
But I am a man of faith.

20:57.829 --> 20:59.007
And I am asking you...

21:02.628 --> 21:04.090
I am begging you...

21:05.509 --> 21:06.786
Have faith.

21:08.069 --> 21:09.825
Not in me. Not even in this.

21:10.949 --> 21:12.575
But faith in Man...

21:13.957 --> 21:17.699
Faith that the ones you would
leave behind deserve a chance.

21:29.029 --> 21:31.615
- Where are we going?
- Come on. Hold on to the ticket.

21:34.246 --> 21:34.976
Run!

21:36.421 --> 21:37.437
Hurry!

21:39.398 --> 21:40.445
Come on.

21:54.086 --> 21:56.028
Leave it! Run!

22:15.846 --> 22:16.991
That's ours.

22:17.926 --> 22:19.420
There it is. Come on.

22:26.214 --> 22:27.676
Good boy, come on.

22:27.975 --> 22:29.186
Evacuation passes?

22:30.439 --> 22:31.486
But I had two tickets.

22:32.422 --> 22:33.797
I have it here, wait.

22:34.502 --> 22:38.331
- Take the child and leave her.
- Put me down!

22:38.854 --> 22:41.123
- Mum!
- Get off me!

22:41.735 --> 22:42.912
No!

22:43.558 --> 22:44.867
- Mum!
- No!

22:46.247 --> 22:47.621
No!

22:48.615 --> 22:49.662
No!

22:55.752 --> 22:57.127
No!

23:05.256 --> 23:07.744
Who could imagine we should
see days like these?

23:08.390 --> 23:10.049
You should have gone, Brother.

23:10.918 --> 23:15.491
The barricades are crumbling...
they'll be here soon.

23:16.167 --> 23:17.247
When do you leave?

23:17.255 --> 23:20.834
The absence of gravity interferes
with my digestion, so...

23:21.576 --> 23:24.391
I shall stay.

23:26.184 --> 23:29.314
Perhaps Man can make a fresh
start on the New Worlds.

23:30.183 --> 23:32.703
But they won't need
this old serpent around...

23:33.159 --> 23:34.948
making the same mistakes.

23:42.824 --> 23:44.101
Where will you go?

23:45.577 --> 23:49.122
I shall return to my
brothers and sisters.

23:51.463 --> 23:56.449
How will you get there? The city
is under siege on all sides.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.775
It shall be as God wills.

24:01.927 --> 24:03.302
"As God wills"...

24:05.320 --> 24:07.426
yes, perhaps it will be.

24:09.736 --> 24:12.965
I have a ship. It won't hold twenty.

24:13.672 --> 24:15.265
You'll have to make do with less.

24:16.904 --> 24:19.108
Take these.

24:20.392 --> 24:23.206
- And what are they?
- Off world tickets.

24:24.201 --> 24:27.048
They should help you recruit
some men for your mission.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.458
Why are you doing this?

24:33.257 --> 24:37.959
Many men think they are going to die,
Brother. A few of us know it.

24:39.817 --> 24:42.370
And the closer I get to my end...

24:43.273 --> 24:47.584
I find hope is the only investment
worthy of my attention.

24:49.737 --> 24:51.625
Sir! The perimeter's fallen!

24:51.945 --> 24:54.334
They're hard upon us!
Your ship's ready.

24:54.473 --> 24:57.954
I'm staying, but Brother Samuel
will be travelling with you.

24:58.154 --> 24:59.494
Take him where he'd like to go.

24:59.785 --> 25:02.174
Brother Samuel,
we have very little time.

25:06.666 --> 25:07.975
God bless you, Constantine.

25:09.066 --> 25:11.270
I sincerely hope so, Brother.

25:13.353 --> 25:14.728
Brother Samuel?

25:16.266 --> 25:19.015
Are... are you the One?
Will you Deliver us?

25:19.978 --> 25:21.700
Pray God that I am.

26:11.146 --> 26:12.870
Do you even have a name?

26:41.131 --> 26:42.757
- Mitch.
- Addy.

26:45.035 --> 26:46.312
Nathan's not here.

26:47.499 --> 26:48.709
Yeah, I know I...

26:49.931 --> 26:51.240
Please, come in.

26:59.275 --> 27:00.585
I'll make some tea.

27:02.987 --> 27:04.132
Gosh, you've changed.

27:05.452 --> 27:07.840
How long has it been?
Feels like forever.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.519
- You remember, Grace?
- Yes, Ma'am.

27:14.666 --> 27:18.016
She's ten now... ten years old...

27:19.435 --> 27:22.502
which means, almost five years...
gosh, has it been that long?

27:27.052 --> 27:28.296
Here's your tea.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.162
Nobody told you?

27:33.197 --> 27:34.822
No, they won't tell me anything.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.530
On behalf of the Exec...

27:42.892 --> 27:44.201
Hold it.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.948
"On behalf of the Executive
Vice President of Personnel...

27:54.956 --> 27:59.364
I've been authorized to inform you
that, Captain Nathan William Rooker...

27:59.500 --> 28:00.994
<i>has been declared missing in...</i>

28:02.061 --> 28:03.554
<i>missing in action."</i>

28:06.412 --> 28:08.867
I have these dreams.
I could see him.

28:12.653 --> 28:15.370
They're hurting him.
He's still alive.

28:15.533 --> 28:17.027
I know he's still alive.

28:17.197 --> 28:21.769
Listen, if you think like that,
you'll drive yourself crazy.

28:23.597 --> 28:25.636
You've got Grace to think about.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.834
And they expect us just
to wait here and die.

28:30.989 --> 28:33.444
I just don't know what I'm
going to tell my little girl.

29:01.614 --> 29:02.694
Leave it.

29:19.821 --> 29:21.065
Sergeant Hunter?

29:23.247 --> 29:27.687
A soldier in your platoon suggested me
your name, Jesus Barrera.

29:28.526 --> 29:29.868
El Jesus.

29:30.606 --> 29:32.265
I need soldiers for a mission.

29:33.551 --> 29:35.177
A mission to destroy the enemy.

29:36.398 --> 29:37.924
What enemy is that?

29:39.663 --> 29:41.321
The Enemy of Man.

29:42.191 --> 29:45.126
I don't expect that any of us
will survive, but it's a chance...

29:46.671 --> 29:49.867
a chance to save mankind,
a chance to save the world.

29:51.214 --> 29:52.873
Maybe the last chance.

29:54.255 --> 29:56.524
Well, fuck mankind. Fuck the world.

30:03.247 --> 30:04.457
Fuck you.

30:08.559 --> 30:10.631
Corporal Barrera told
me you would say that.

30:13.134 --> 30:15.207
He also said... how did he put it?

30:16.239 --> 30:18.792
That you needed a 'get
out of hell, free' card.

30:20.144 --> 30:23.178
Well... these won't
get you out of hell.

30:27.215 --> 30:29.485
But they may put you
on the right road.

30:45.168 --> 30:47.721
<i>If I don't make it out of here,</i>
<i>can you look after the girls?</i>

31:01.103 --> 31:02.827
Here, put your hat on.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.989
<i>The tickets were life.</i>

31:23.119 --> 31:26.665
<i>Everyone wanted one, but who</i>
<i>would take such an offer?</i>

31:27.921 --> 31:29.263
<i>Jesus Barrera.</i>

31:29.648 --> 31:31.853
<i>He wouldn't go unless</i>
<i>I promised his mother...</i>

31:31.856 --> 31:33.547
<i>it meant he would go to heaven.</i>

31:33.553 --> 31:35.789
<i>I did. God forgive me.</i>

31:37.393 --> 31:41.070
<i>John MacGuire. The only soldier</i>
<i>who refused the tickets.</i>

31:41.552 --> 31:44.553
<i>The sort of a man we should</i>
<i>be saving not sacrificing.</i>

31:47.472 --> 31:52.012
<i>Valerie Duval. A single</i>
<i>mother with sixty-one kills...</i>

31:52.657 --> 31:53.868
<i>so young.</i>

31:54.993 --> 31:56.486
<i>Juba Kim Wu.</i>

31:56.977 --> 32:01.200
<i>When I told him that none of us</i>
<i>would be coming back, he smiled.</i>

32:02.417 --> 32:06.028
<i>Maximillian Von Steiner.</i>
<i>An officer and an aristocrat.</i>

32:06.513 --> 32:09.263
<i>A leader, but would he follow?</i>

32:10.160 --> 32:13.356
The Chronicles foretell of
the release of the enemy...

32:14.322 --> 32:17.704
the ruin of the world,
the final days of our age.

32:19.538 --> 32:24.207
But, they also prophecy
the survival of Man...

32:25.809 --> 32:27.216
that Neachdainn the Deliverer...

32:27.953 --> 32:29.994
shall walk reborn among us...

32:30.161 --> 32:31.688
and deliver us from destruction.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.647
It is in the service
of that prophecy...

32:41.554 --> 32:45.351
that we are now irrevocably bound.

32:57.554 --> 32:58.569
Brother?

33:00.530 --> 33:02.701
- How's the leg?
- It's good.

33:05.362 --> 33:10.185
Six weeks ago, in artillery exchange
between Bauhaus and Capitol...

33:12.787 --> 33:14.193
That's your friend.

33:18.098 --> 33:20.749
In the ruins of the
Imperial City of Canaan...

33:20.754 --> 33:23.984
there's an old cathedral. It's
catacombs open onto a network...

33:23.986 --> 33:26.539
of subterranean tunnels...

33:27.027 --> 33:32.177
you will travel along these tunnels,
find the machine and blow it up.

33:32.435 --> 33:34.704
Is that all? We just blow it up?

33:35.634 --> 33:36.845
We have a device.

33:40.434 --> 33:41.961
A device?

33:44.755 --> 33:47.472
From the first Brotherhood
battle with the mutants...

33:47.635 --> 33:51.629
ripped from the Machine before
the Great Seal was laid.

33:52.467 --> 33:53.743
So, it's a bomb?

33:54.932 --> 33:58.193
We don't know, but we think it is.

33:58.611 --> 33:59.986
You think so?

34:00.180 --> 34:03.496
Our information comes from
ancient schematics, Lieutenant.

34:03.795 --> 34:05.835
Not an instruction manual.

34:06.323 --> 34:09.193
The device is as ancient
as Neachdainn itself.

34:09.780 --> 34:13.195
The Chronicles show it placed
in the centre of the Machine.

34:13.716 --> 34:16.813
It's covered in symbols which
we think are warnings.

34:17.012 --> 34:19.313
- How safe is it to transport?
- Does it matter, MacGuire?

34:19.507 --> 34:22.290
You can call me Captain,
Steiner, and yes.

34:22.292 --> 34:23.949
Bombs don't get stable
when they get old.

34:24.114 --> 34:25.577
It's a two stage device.

34:25.587 --> 34:26.962
You carry the trigger separately.

34:27.123 --> 34:28.813
Without it, the bomb's
just dead weight.

34:29.554 --> 34:31.465
- What type of trigger?
- Mechanical.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.510
Place it in the device
and turn it with a key...

34:34.706 --> 34:35.885
which we don't have.

34:36.244 --> 34:38.382
- You'll have to find it.
- Are you kidding me with this guy?

34:39.572 --> 34:43.150
It looks like this and it
should be in the Machine.

34:44.020 --> 34:45.875
And if we can't find it?

34:46.835 --> 34:48.494
Then the mission will fail...

34:48.851 --> 34:52.235
and every man, woman and child
on this planet will die.

34:56.083 --> 34:58.057
Why don't we throw it down
that big, fucking hole?

34:59.380 --> 35:01.802
The Machine is 10,000 years old.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.718
It has survived earthquakes...

35:04.724 --> 35:07.091
pressure changes, plate tectonics.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.100
Then why the fuck the bomb?

35:09.427 --> 35:14.894
Because, Corporal, one of us will
place the bomb inside the machine.

35:15.061 --> 35:16.850
- The Deliverer?
- That's right.

35:17.652 --> 35:19.311
What pendejo drew that short hair?

35:20.982 --> 35:22.803
I did.

35:25.269 --> 35:29.360
That's a very handy book, but we'll
be doing some killing on our way down.

35:29.813 --> 35:33.075
Does your Chronicle offer
any suggestions there?

35:35.189 --> 35:36.563
I can.

35:43.157 --> 35:45.230
Courtesy of the Bauhaus Corporation.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.697
Keep to the near wall.

36:02.486 --> 36:06.283
As you can see, individual
bullets are largely useless.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.744
Mutants don't feel pain...

36:14.678 --> 36:16.052
or go into shock.

36:17.014 --> 36:18.443
How can it move at all?

36:18.837 --> 36:20.812
We believe there's changes
to the mitochondria...

36:20.821 --> 36:23.342
which boost myofascial release.

36:23.541 --> 36:25.647
Cut a chicken's head off
and watch it dance.

36:26.069 --> 36:27.476
How did you capture this thing?

36:27.638 --> 36:30.256
Our scientists requested
a subject for tests.

36:30.582 --> 36:33.070
So, we went out with
shock sticks and nets...

36:34.134 --> 36:37.331
the sticks were useless and those
blades tore our nets like paper.

36:38.038 --> 36:40.013
We finally pinned this
one under a tank.

36:40.470 --> 36:42.836
- How many men did you lose?
- I didn't count.

36:43.447 --> 36:45.073
What's the fastest way to kill it?

36:45.398 --> 36:49.011
Catastrophic tissue damage,
automatic small arms fire...

36:49.494 --> 36:52.561
usually a clip or more explosives.

36:52.791 --> 36:56.020
- What about Willy-Petes?
- White phosphorous?

37:14.359 --> 37:15.821
And swords.

37:44.279 --> 37:46.133
Help me...

37:49.303 --> 37:51.159
Help me...

37:51.415 --> 37:52.822
There's somebody alive in there.

38:07.288 --> 38:09.044
You'll not receive the Sacrament?

38:09.208 --> 38:10.582
I'm not hungry.

38:12.375 --> 38:13.553
That man?

38:13.784 --> 38:14.766
He died.

38:14.936 --> 38:16.310
Did he say anything?

38:16.472 --> 38:17.879
He asked for forgiveness.

38:18.839 --> 38:22.636
Do you think inside every
one of those things...

38:23.703 --> 38:28.079
I don't know. We can only
pray that God is Merciful.

38:31.257 --> 38:32.631
No days like that.

38:34.649 --> 38:36.023
- Brother Samuel?
- Captain?

38:36.984 --> 38:38.872
This is a list of supplies.

38:41.336 --> 38:43.245
We'll need them as soon as possible.

38:43.416 --> 38:44.594
This is a House of God.

38:44.601 --> 38:46.390
And we're going to
die doing his work.

38:50.361 --> 38:52.466
For one thing,
there is no alcohol here.

38:52.633 --> 38:54.543
You telling me, God don't drink?

38:57.209 --> 38:59.958
- That's for Communion.
- This is communion.

39:04.825 --> 39:09.429
<i>One last Mass, one last Communion.</i>

39:14.009 --> 39:16.692
<i>Severian, Guardian</i>
<i>of the Chronicles...</i>

39:17.657 --> 39:19.445
<i>prepares to dress for battle.</i>

39:20.281 --> 39:21.688
<i>Bound by silence...</i>

39:22.104 --> 39:24.494
<i>she cannot voice</i>
<i>the pain she feels...</i>

39:25.370 --> 39:27.955
<i>for leaving the only</i>
<i>home she has ever known.</i>

40:17.467 --> 40:21.395
<i>And now, I must succeed</i>
<i>where Man had failed.</i>

40:22.810 --> 40:23.793
<i>God help me...</i>

40:25.179 --> 40:26.901
<i>God help us all.</i>

40:28.410 --> 40:29.457
Amen.

40:52.251 --> 40:53.428
It's time.

41:03.099 --> 41:04.528
Juba Kim Wu.

41:06.588 --> 41:08.409
Maximillian Von Steiner.

41:10.938 --> 41:13.110
Valerie Chinois Duval.

41:24.379 --> 41:26.353
John Patrick MacGuire.

41:30.907 --> 41:33.722
Jesus Alexandro
Dominguin de Barrera.

41:35.324 --> 41:36.055
What?

41:43.804 --> 41:45.627
John Mitchell Hunter.

42:17.340 --> 42:19.250
Didn't know there were any left.

42:19.932 --> 42:21.176
Ever used one of these?

42:22.461 --> 42:24.119
On the bat a few times.

42:40.989 --> 42:41.916
<i>Engine one hot.</i>

42:46.077 --> 42:48.181
<i>Engine two hot.</i>

42:49.021 --> 42:51.126
<i>Engine three rising.</i>

42:52.573 --> 42:54.842
<i>Engine four rising.</i>

42:59.390 --> 43:01.626
<i>Stokers, engine two hot.</i>

43:03.581 --> 43:05.436
Boiler one, red line.

43:06.461 --> 43:08.469
Boiler two red line.
Ready for launch.

43:09.214 --> 43:10.523
Sound all clear.

43:12.765 --> 43:16.889
You fought with Capitol's 101
in Africa, under Bishop.

43:17.053 --> 43:17.849
That's right.

43:18.046 --> 43:20.696
I was on the other side.
Imperial Eights.

43:20.990 --> 43:22.005
I know.

43:22.174 --> 43:24.442
I'm glad to be fighting
beside you on this one.

43:24.637 --> 43:25.369
Huh?

43:25.374 --> 43:26.715
I'm glad to be on the same side.

43:26.846 --> 43:27.861
What?

43:29.918 --> 43:31.741
- Power up one and two.
- One and two.

43:36.574 --> 43:38.135
<i>Power up three and four.</i>

44:56.832 --> 44:57.912
What?

44:58.144 --> 44:59.354
Your fish.

45:01.248 --> 45:03.288
Kills. Every one of them.

45:05.055 --> 45:06.037
You're the shark.

45:06.208 --> 45:09.174
Death is the shark.
I'm just a guy with a gun.

45:12.288 --> 45:15.484
Multiple contacts
at 0-0-4 and 0-1-5.

45:20.096 --> 45:22.299
Escaping transport. They're
getting the hell out of here.

45:25.984 --> 45:27.675
There goes all the money.

45:28.161 --> 45:30.135
Looks like we got on the
wrong, fucking shuttle.

45:30.336 --> 45:31.863
You were born on the
wrong, fucking shuttle.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.937
What crawled up your ass and died?

45:34.943 --> 45:35.991
Your Mother.

45:36.001 --> 45:38.390
No, my mother's too fat.

45:38.944 --> 45:43.221
But my sister could, she's
as thin as a fucking weasel!

45:45.920 --> 45:48.538
- So, who got them?
- What?

45:49.633 --> 45:51.455
- Your tickets.
- Why do you want to know?

45:52.673 --> 45:54.102
Suicide mission.

45:54.848 --> 45:58.110
We're supposed to die together,
that's an intimate thing.

45:58.304 --> 45:59.865
You make it sound like
we're going to fuck.

46:00.417 --> 46:03.645
You can fuck a lot of people,
you only die once.

46:04.257 --> 46:05.631
It's fucked up.

46:06.016 --> 46:08.384
- What about you?
- What about me?

46:09.602 --> 46:10.976
Your tickets.

46:15.136 --> 46:16.380
Stand behind the line.

46:17.345 --> 46:18.774
Just, just looking.

46:19.745 --> 46:21.240
Look all you want.

46:21.536 --> 46:23.446
Get in my way while I'm flying this...

46:23.457 --> 46:24.798
we're gonna have some problems.

46:27.809 --> 46:28.922
Shit!

46:29.857 --> 46:33.851
- So... where we at?
- Close. Crossing the Median.

46:35.041 --> 46:36.984
Start our descent
into Imperial Sector.

46:37.729 --> 46:39.006
Imperial's bad.

46:39.107 --> 46:40.896
It's bad all over this world,
no matter where you go.

46:41.665 --> 46:44.448
After we drop, you're what?
Off to Mars? Luna?

46:44.610 --> 46:46.497
I already used too much
fuel to make orbit...

46:47.074 --> 46:48.350
much less break it.

46:48.546 --> 46:50.008
So you're fucked like
the rest of us.

46:50.305 --> 46:53.372
Man does everything for a reason,
even if he doesn't know it...

46:54.882 --> 46:58.776
or else, what is he? Just like
one of those things out there.

46:59.234 --> 47:00.608
Just another demon.

47:02.305 --> 47:04.345
- Who got yours?
- I have two children.

47:04.674 --> 47:06.780
- You look a little young.
- I started young.

47:07.202 --> 47:11.196
- What are their names?
- Jack's seven, Constance is five.

47:12.579 --> 47:14.717
Getting on the ship, you'd think
they were going on a ride...

47:14.722 --> 47:16.216
they were so excited.

47:17.986 --> 47:19.677
End of the world.

47:21.826 --> 47:24.346
There's this girl,
I don't know her name.

47:25.538 --> 47:27.448
She works at The Pearl,
across from the barracks.

47:27.810 --> 47:32.383
She's got this walk, pure
beauty, eyes you could drown in.

47:32.611 --> 47:35.164
You gave your ticket to a woman
and you didn't even fuck her?

47:35.171 --> 47:36.926
I said I didn't know her name.

47:37.090 --> 47:38.651
So, you fucked her then.

47:44.418 --> 47:47.320
Another contact at 3-4-3.
This one's closing.

47:47.682 --> 47:48.959
Give them a heads up.

47:49.858 --> 47:52.346
Strap in. I'm about to put
this baby through some paces.

47:54.339 --> 47:57.209
Attention! Transport HMS Tango-6...

47:57.442 --> 47:59.614
you are encroaching
on a military vessel.

47:59.875 --> 48:03.966
<i>Come around till you're heading</i>
<i>0- 3-8, let's take this 0-3-8.</i>

48:04.131 --> 48:08.321
0-three-eight, copy? No response.

48:08.483 --> 48:10.044
Plumbers flying planes.

48:11.107 --> 48:12.634
Changing course to 2-8-5.

48:13.122 --> 48:14.551
Two-eight-five, aye!

48:14.755 --> 48:16.349
Diving to 50,000 feet...

48:16.547 --> 48:18.522
Fifty-angels, aye!

48:24.035 --> 48:25.312
What the fuck's going on?

48:28.099 --> 48:29.474
That ought to do it.

48:29.731 --> 48:32.448
They've changed direction.
They're on an intercept course.

48:34.947 --> 48:35.963
Take your station.

48:36.100 --> 48:38.303
- That's a civilian ship.
- Take your station, soldier.

48:39.940 --> 48:41.401
Somebody tell me, what's going on?

48:48.100 --> 48:50.685
<i>HMS Tango-6, you must break off.</i>

48:52.997 --> 48:54.044
Hold on!

49:00.356 --> 49:01.883
<i>They're coming straight</i>
<i>at us, Captain.</i>

49:02.115 --> 49:04.963
<i>HMS Tango-6, break off or</i>
<i>you will be fired upon.</i>

49:05.092 --> 49:07.197
Repeat, you will be fired upon.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.740
<i>You must break off now!</i>

49:16.229 --> 49:17.177
Fire!

49:18.117 --> 49:19.360
They're going to ram us...

49:19.492 --> 49:20.353
Fire!

49:34.021 --> 49:35.265
<i>Captain, I've lost them.</i>

49:54.309 --> 49:55.650
Get to the escape pod!

49:58.661 --> 50:00.483
Come on, let's get in the pod. Go!

50:00.612 --> 50:02.271
Let's go, let's go.

50:02.405 --> 50:03.583
Get in the pod.

50:06.758 --> 50:08.218
Go, quick!

50:08.485 --> 50:09.860
Let's go, let's go.

50:10.853 --> 50:11.901
The bomb!

50:12.774 --> 50:13.853
Where's the bomb?

50:14.085 --> 50:16.223
Come on, come on!

50:18.374 --> 50:19.683
Give me that damn thing. Come on!

50:22.469 --> 50:23.713
Let's get out of here!

50:28.586 --> 50:30.474
- Pull the fucking chute!
- It's not releasing.

50:32.330 --> 50:33.345
What are you doing?

50:33.515 --> 50:35.206
Manual release on the outside.

50:35.338 --> 50:36.320
You'll be killed.

50:46.315 --> 50:47.689
Here we go...

50:50.284 --> 50:51.429
Come on!

50:53.676 --> 50:56.164
Pull the fucking chute!
Do it! Pull it.

51:03.500 --> 51:04.907
What's going on?

51:05.389 --> 51:06.763
We're still falling.

51:06.892 --> 51:08.780
- We're too heavy.
- We lost the chute.

51:09.133 --> 51:10.377
Goddam it!

51:13.261 --> 51:14.209
Is there a back-up?

51:14.669 --> 51:16.196
Hit the back-up!

51:16.429 --> 51:18.818
- No!
- Fuck, no! Yes, motherfucker.

51:19.053 --> 51:20.841
Pop it now, we'll shred
it like the first!

51:21.101 --> 51:23.436
Open low, it'll slow us down
before we hit.

51:23.630 --> 51:26.248
- Before the silk rips apart.
- He's right.

51:26.414 --> 51:27.788
- What did he say?
- I've got not idea.

51:28.653 --> 51:30.312
- Juba's right.
- Hit the goddam backup.

51:30.478 --> 51:31.557
We've only got one chute left.

51:31.566 --> 51:33.835
We rip that one, we're dead.

51:34.094 --> 51:36.778
When we're lower, we'll pop it.

51:36.942 --> 51:39.309
- Hit the god dam chute.
- 1500.

51:39.694 --> 51:41.101
You better be right
about this, Juba.

51:41.838 --> 51:44.359
You sure you know what
you're talking about?

51:44.526 --> 51:47.309
You better be right about this,
you son of a bitch.

51:48.302 --> 51:50.692
244... 152...

51:50.991 --> 51:52.682
- Ready?
- Any time!

51:52.848 --> 51:53.775
Any time now.

51:58.192 --> 52:00.264
Open! Open now!

52:03.536 --> 52:05.358
- Now!
- Pull the goddam chute!

52:25.713 --> 52:26.793
There you go...

52:27.410 --> 52:29.101
Come on, give me that.

52:37.169 --> 52:38.380
The Captain's fucked.

52:46.034 --> 52:47.857
We'll cut you loose.

52:48.179 --> 52:50.284
It hit the artery.

52:51.666 --> 52:54.514
If you pull it out, I'm gone.

53:02.324 --> 53:04.112
- Amen.
- Amen.

53:17.333 --> 53:18.445
Sergeant Hunter.

53:20.724 --> 53:25.842
May I ask the borrow
of a grenade, please?

53:41.749 --> 53:42.797
Thank you.

53:46.262 --> 53:47.822
Good luck, Sergeant.

54:04.663 --> 54:05.263
White phosphorous?

54:05.270 --> 54:07.278
Conchita here, she's
a real spitfire.

54:07.671 --> 54:10.322
Just make sure you're not near
me when your gun blows up.

54:10.488 --> 54:13.936
- Where are we?
- Off by 4 leagues north-southwest.

54:14.135 --> 54:16.404
Gotta pass through the city
like the old monk said.

54:16.407 --> 54:17.422
Let's go.

54:52.633 --> 54:53.811
Check your targets.

54:56.730 --> 54:57.907
Two...

55:19.004 --> 55:20.411
Need a hand with that, boss?

55:22.076 --> 55:23.385
Be quiet.

55:48.637 --> 55:50.808
Refugees. Where the
hell are they going?

55:55.838 --> 55:57.082
Hunter?

56:14.207 --> 56:16.345
The current bid stands
at two gold watches...

56:16.351 --> 56:18.839
a diamond necklace, and
10,000 gold talents!

56:20.479 --> 56:23.130
Get out of here, go on.
Clear off, then.

56:23.680 --> 56:27.062
- Going once, going twice...
- I said, get back!

56:27.072 --> 56:29.592
Sold! To the skeleton
in the monkey suit.

56:35.072 --> 56:36.479
One ticket, not two!

56:36.928 --> 56:39.710
- I bought it!
- And she'll show her gratitude...

56:39.840 --> 56:42.590
cleaning my crap
from here to Mars.

56:42.944 --> 56:44.886
Unless you want to
buy another ticket?

56:45.761 --> 56:47.168
That's all my money!

56:47.488 --> 56:48.863
Then fuck off!

56:51.809 --> 56:53.435
Do you know who I am?

56:59.042 --> 57:00.449
That's who you are.

57:02.145 --> 57:05.309
Ass, stash or cash!
Nobody rides free!

57:06.018 --> 57:07.774
<i>I want everybody on in ten minutes.</i>

57:07.906 --> 57:08.985
We need to cut through there.

57:09.634 --> 57:10.616
<i>I want diamonds.</i>

57:10.786 --> 57:13.241
- Good place for an ambush.
- Can't be too many mutes.

57:13.762 --> 57:14.940
There's too much easy meat.

57:16.066 --> 57:17.364
All the more reason
for them to come.

57:17.379 --> 57:19.288
<i>I don't care whose... open it.</i>

57:19.715 --> 57:23.327
Come on, show us your money.
It's your life I'm talking about.

57:23.522 --> 57:25.727
Give me that... ah, fuck off.

57:26.179 --> 57:27.488
Let it go, Hunter.

57:30.851 --> 57:32.029
We go through the square.

57:32.644 --> 57:34.618
- We don't have time for this.
- Make time.

57:37.444 --> 57:39.713
The next one begins in 5.000 talents.

57:43.844 --> 57:47.390
Save yourselves.
Get your money out, come on!

57:47.813 --> 57:50.202
Any advance on 6,000?

57:50.404 --> 57:51.614
Come on, we haven't got all day.

57:52.324 --> 57:54.910
Price stands at 7,000 talents...

57:55.044 --> 57:57.019
three bottles of very
old Scottish whiskey...

57:57.701 --> 57:58.813
Get out of it.

58:02.693 --> 58:03.925
Let them on.

58:03.941 --> 58:05.151
Are you making a bid?

58:06.181 --> 58:08.483
First you take the kids
and then the women...

58:08.900 --> 58:10.788
and then you take the men
if there's any room left.

58:10.950 --> 58:14.147
Hey, Soldier-Boy. The ship
can only carry so much weight.

58:15.110 --> 58:17.117
Yeah? What do you weigh?

58:18.054 --> 58:20.225
- 275kg?
- 310kg.

58:28.935 --> 58:32.481
310, that's two women and
two kids. Come on. Let's go.

58:38.088 --> 58:39.975
- What do you weigh?
- Very little.

58:41.799 --> 58:43.326
Dump the luggage. Take them all.

58:58.024 --> 58:59.366
It's top.

58:59.624 --> 59:03.650
Church, it's not too far. It's just
in the middle of the old city.

59:05.480 --> 59:06.855
You figure out where
we're going yet?

59:07.177 --> 59:08.486
Straight on.

59:09.961 --> 59:12.263
Listen you endanger the mission
again, I shoot you myself.

59:12.650 --> 59:14.024
Why wait?

01:00:19.725 --> 01:00:20.969
Christ!

01:00:23.501 --> 01:00:25.225
What sort of church is this?

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:27.684
How do you lose a city?

01:00:38.351 --> 01:00:40.456
The catacombs lead
down to the Lost City.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:51.525
There must be thousands.

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.470
Each New Age builds upon
the bones of the old.

01:00:55.695 --> 01:00:57.605
How many times have
they come before?

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:02.853
They didn't do this, we did this.

01:01:05.296 --> 01:01:07.401
We've always excelled
at killing one another.

01:01:09.329 --> 01:01:11.117
They would challenge our supremacy...

01:01:11.441 --> 01:01:13.546
as the architects of our own end.

01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:15.594
Halt!

01:01:31.858 --> 01:01:33.102
- Brother?
- Yes?

01:01:39.442 --> 01:01:40.969
The Lost City.

01:01:43.218 --> 01:01:46.634
That skyscraper, we need
to go down, deep into it.

01:01:48.658 --> 01:01:51.725
The City of the Ancients,
buried 500 years ago...

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:53.040
in the Black Winter.

01:01:56.627 --> 01:01:59.147
- Holy shit!
- We're being watched.

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.034
What are they?

01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:49.013
I have no idea.

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.427
What's it say?

01:03:02.167 --> 01:03:03.792
"Abandon all hope."

01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:05.968
Motherfuckers.

01:03:08.568 --> 01:03:09.680
No shit.

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:21.583
Jesus, that's deep.

01:03:22.008 --> 01:03:23.634
Someone's going to
have to stay up here.

01:03:23.929 --> 01:03:25.652
We don't want them coming
down on top of us.

01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:28.211
I got it.

01:03:29.081 --> 01:03:30.674
You watch your ass
out there, compañero.

01:03:33.017 --> 01:03:34.446
It don't look that safe.

01:03:35.097 --> 01:03:36.821
Got to pay for those
tickets sooner or later.

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:40.853
Take care of yourself, Juba.

01:03:42.938 --> 01:03:46.287
Sixty storeys. We'll go first
and let the others find the way.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:49.240
Yeah, what do you say?

01:03:53.562 --> 01:03:55.634
Brother, alright.

01:03:56.379 --> 01:03:59.379
This is the brake. It controls
how fast you go down, okay?

01:04:00.954 --> 01:04:03.988
You lift it up and
let yourself down.

01:04:04.891 --> 01:04:06.265
Punch it in, you stop.

01:04:09.915 --> 01:04:13.265
- That's it. Just take it easy.
- And this?

01:04:13.435 --> 01:04:15.410
That's the quick release.
Don't touch that.

01:04:19.196 --> 01:04:20.406
You alright?

01:04:22.011 --> 01:04:23.222
Let's go.

01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:34.645
20.

01:04:37.181 --> 01:04:38.741
How fucking deep is this thing?

01:04:47.614 --> 01:04:49.621
- It's getting hot down here.
- 40

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:00.856
- Samuel?
- 55.

01:05:01.246 --> 01:05:02.228
How far?

01:05:03.679 --> 01:05:05.140
- Stop!
- 60

01:05:08.319 --> 01:05:10.523
- We're running out of rope here.
- We've gone too far.

01:05:12.255 --> 01:05:14.644
It's dark, God, it's dark.

01:05:15.327 --> 01:05:16.571
Something's not right.

01:05:24.192 --> 01:05:26.428
- It can't be.
- Got anything in that dammed book?

01:05:26.527 --> 01:05:27.869
What have I missed?

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.655
We got people coming down.

01:05:38.432 --> 01:05:40.986
<i>Don't fall behind, Steiner.</i>
<i>It's a long way down.</i>

01:05:42.273 --> 01:05:43.866
<i>Yeah, all the way to hell.</i>

01:06:25.955 --> 01:06:27.678
Weird sounds down here, pal.

01:06:30.147 --> 01:06:33.017
It has to be here.
55, 60 floors down...

01:06:33.187 --> 01:06:35.326
there should be a ledge.
It says so right here.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.291
It has to be here.

01:06:52.517 --> 01:06:54.306
- Don't let me fall.
- I'm trying.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:10.245
You are a lucky son of a bitch.

01:07:10.534 --> 01:07:11.778
God provides, Sergeant.

01:07:20.038 --> 01:07:21.347
God provides.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:34.398
Close the gate.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.094
Hold up! Hold up!

01:07:37.415 --> 01:07:38.364
<i>Coming down.</i>

01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:42.497
We got an ugly.

01:07:47.016 --> 01:07:49.602
- We're bottled up in here.
- Wait! Use this.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.157
Grenade!

01:08:03.625 --> 01:08:05.086
- Grenade!
- Grenade!

01:08:07.273 --> 01:08:08.647
Don't drop that match!

01:09:08.365 --> 01:09:09.859
Go, go, go!

01:09:59.408 --> 01:10:01.547
- Any last words?
- Shut the fuck up!

01:10:23.857 --> 01:10:25.319
Are you well?

01:10:30.386 --> 01:10:31.368
Reload!

01:10:39.347 --> 01:10:40.175
Down!

01:10:55.283 --> 01:10:56.712
Anybody hurt?

01:11:07.412 --> 01:11:09.616
Hey... shit!

01:11:17.077 --> 01:11:19.117
Let's go... let's go.

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:30.252
Dead end.

01:11:30.389 --> 01:11:32.942
- Anyone got a deck of cards?
- MacGuire.

01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:35.154
Figures.

01:11:42.326 --> 01:11:43.340
Thanks.

01:12:02.872 --> 01:12:05.872
They use tunnels to drag
bodies to the machine.

01:12:06.487 --> 01:12:08.397
It takes days, weeks even.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.513
You got a lot of faith in that book.

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.190
You're wasting your time, Steiner.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.269
I will not let a handful
of rocks stop us.

01:12:16.568 --> 01:12:19.187
- It's a lot more than a handful.
- You find any inspiration?

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:23.855
It's a very good book, but in the end,
even this book, is just a book.

01:12:25.657 --> 01:12:26.737
Well...

01:12:27.129 --> 01:12:29.333
And I take my Faith
from something Greater.

01:12:30.745 --> 01:12:32.850
Well, I haven't seen
much to have faith in.

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:35.286
You have seen the worst
that Man can do.

01:12:37.273 --> 01:12:39.924
But you've not seen the
worst the Enemy can do.

01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:44.820
- So, who got your tickets?
- What?

01:12:46.074 --> 01:12:47.252
Your tickets?

01:12:47.418 --> 01:12:50.233
- What does it matter?
- It matters to me.

01:12:58.395 --> 01:12:59.769
Who cares?

01:13:00.891 --> 01:13:02.353
I'm sorry.

01:13:04.443 --> 01:13:06.864
Everything that is, comes from God.

01:13:08.123 --> 01:13:10.294
Everything is from God, and of God.

01:13:11.195 --> 01:13:14.042
The Enemy came from the outside.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:18.330
And as God is Life,
the Enemy is Unlife.

01:13:19.483 --> 01:13:22.996
It is the end of
every living thing...

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:24.404
everywhere...

01:13:25.116 --> 01:13:26.523
and for all time.

01:13:28.284 --> 01:13:31.830
And so, I have Faith
that we will triumph.

01:13:34.525 --> 01:13:37.143
Because the alternative
is too terrible to contemplate.

01:13:37.917 --> 01:13:39.925
What if you don't believe in God?

01:13:40.093 --> 01:13:42.744
If you did not believe in God,
you would not be here.

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:47.415
Are you guys gonna help?

01:13:47.741 --> 01:13:50.611
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but your mission is kind of fucked.

01:13:56.158 --> 01:13:57.817
You should have a little faith.

01:14:11.391 --> 01:14:12.667
Give me a hand.

01:14:21.728 --> 01:14:23.157
Something's down there.

01:14:37.889 --> 01:14:39.165
Hold up!

01:14:44.193 --> 01:14:47.259
Poor bastards! Looks like they've
been down there for weeks.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.815
We mustn't linger here.

01:14:56.929 --> 01:14:58.238
Where the hell are they taking them?

01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:01.948
Hunter? What is he doing?

01:15:04.098 --> 01:15:05.953
- Is that?
- Sergeant?

01:15:06.242 --> 01:15:07.769
- Jesus.
- Top?

01:15:08.066 --> 01:15:09.048
That's Nathan.

01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:12.220
Fuck!

01:15:12.803 --> 01:15:13.980
Come on, let's go.

01:15:15.523 --> 01:15:16.733
It's just one man.

01:15:17.027 --> 01:15:18.303
I know that man.

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.690
We have a mission.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.794
Vaya con Dios.

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.533
Let's go!

01:16:41.768 --> 01:16:43.459
- Nate!
- Mitch?

01:16:45.096 --> 01:16:46.656
They got you as well.

01:16:47.273 --> 01:16:49.095
Don't talk. I'm getting
you out of here, pal.

01:16:52.232 --> 01:16:54.502
- Where are my girls?
- They're safe.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.229
They're halfway to Mars by now.

01:16:58.345 --> 01:16:59.522
Ready?

01:17:06.441 --> 01:17:08.296
We're almost there, keep going.

01:17:14.762 --> 01:17:16.006
What's that?

01:17:37.227 --> 01:17:38.951
What the fuck are you doing?

01:17:39.978 --> 01:17:41.571
I've got to find another
way out of here.

01:17:45.964 --> 01:17:49.576
I'm going to make you a sling...
get you out of this hole.

01:17:56.108 --> 01:17:58.825
- Mars, eh?
- Yeah... Mars.

01:17:59.916 --> 01:18:02.305
- How do you explain that one?
- I did a deal for a guy...

01:18:05.261 --> 01:18:08.109
Yeah, you know.
Save the world kind of thing.

01:18:11.277 --> 01:18:12.739
How's it going?

01:18:19.885 --> 01:18:21.129
Jesus!

01:18:23.374 --> 01:18:25.414
Listen to me. Listen.

01:18:27.342 --> 01:18:28.771
Finish your mission.

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:33.223
I can't leave you here.

01:18:33.615 --> 01:18:34.859
I'm not asking you to.

01:18:48.687 --> 01:18:51.721
Tell Adelaide, and Gracie...

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.145
Tell them, tell them...

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:02.986
- Tell them.
- Right.

01:19:04.464 --> 01:19:06.319
- No.
- Right.

01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:18.219
You remember that...

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:49.577
Help!

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:52.878
The bag. We can't lose the bomb.

01:19:57.332 --> 01:19:58.761
Take it! Take it!

01:20:01.172 --> 01:20:02.481
Give me your hand!

01:20:17.524 --> 01:20:18.735
We must go on.

01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:30.412
- We have to go on!
- We're still human, Samuel.

01:20:39.798 --> 01:20:41.227
- Thank you.
- It's an honour.

01:20:52.407 --> 01:20:53.519
Fuck you!

01:21:27.513 --> 01:21:28.942
Oh, come on, give me a sign.

01:21:33.913 --> 01:21:35.058
Come on, fucker!

01:21:35.929 --> 01:21:36.823
No!

01:21:37.401 --> 01:21:38.775
No!

01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:12.408
Severian!

01:22:41.949 --> 01:22:43.062
El Jesus.

01:22:43.645 --> 01:22:44.441
Hunter!

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.240
When's the last time you spoke?

01:22:52.254 --> 01:22:53.498
I can't remember.

01:22:56.126 --> 01:22:57.336
I couldn't save him.

01:22:58.910 --> 01:23:01.398
They dragged them
all the way to the Machine.

01:23:11.039 --> 01:23:13.406
- What are you doing?
- We need this damn book.

01:23:14.143 --> 01:23:15.092
It is not permitted.

01:23:18.719 --> 01:23:19.799
They took everything.

01:23:19.808 --> 01:23:22.677
He kept looking at this
damn stuff. What's it say?

01:23:23.808 --> 01:23:25.302
- I don't know.
- Read it!

01:23:26.239 --> 01:23:28.923
- I can't.
- Come here!

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.778
Look, read.

01:23:32.608 --> 01:23:33.753
I can't read.

01:23:34.848 --> 01:23:36.092
You can't...

01:23:37.761 --> 01:23:40.030
How can you believe in a book
if you can't even read it?

01:23:40.192 --> 01:23:44.121
I don't need to read it
to believe that it's true.

01:23:48.609 --> 01:23:50.682
- That's the nature of Faith.
- Fantastic!

01:23:52.546 --> 01:23:54.106
What do you believe in?

01:23:58.498 --> 01:24:02.011
I'm not paid to believe.
I'm paid to fuck shit up.

01:24:03.458 --> 01:24:04.952
Are you coming?

01:24:36.388 --> 01:24:38.014
<i>Help me, please!</i>

01:24:42.117 --> 01:24:43.971
<i>Help me!</i>

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.712
<i>Help me, please!</i>

01:25:28.487 --> 01:25:30.560
Shit! Duval and Steiner.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.855
Are you guys still alive?

01:26:23.306 --> 01:26:24.768
Can you still hold a gun?

01:26:25.034 --> 01:26:26.725
Only with my right.

01:26:30.187 --> 01:26:31.496
How about a rope?

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:40.005
Just say when.

01:27:24.878 --> 01:27:26.285
God damn it!

01:27:28.975 --> 01:27:32.553
I think they're coming through.
That tunnel's not going to hold.

01:27:43.343 --> 01:27:46.125
These rocks are not going to
hold them away much longer.

01:27:46.287 --> 01:27:47.814
Can't you go any faster?

01:27:58.448 --> 01:28:01.383
Steiner? Steiner!

01:29:54.039 --> 01:29:55.981
Jesus... no!

01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:46.454
Hunter?

01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:07.378
Are you one of them?

01:31:07.612 --> 01:31:09.270
Get that pig-sticker out of my face.

01:31:09.563 --> 01:31:10.545
Are you?

01:31:11.163 --> 01:31:13.018
What do you think?
Give me that bomb!

01:31:16.315 --> 01:31:17.526
Give me the fucking bomb!

01:31:25.597 --> 01:31:27.190
Shit! Here come
those motherfuckers.

01:32:12.415 --> 01:32:13.757
Anytime!

01:32:24.992 --> 01:32:26.780
Put the detonator in the hole.

01:32:26.944 --> 01:32:28.952
- You've got to be shitting.
- Put it in the hole!

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.908
- Which hole?
- Any hole!

01:32:34.432 --> 01:32:35.359
This one...

01:32:38.913 --> 01:32:40.855
Piece of shit... it doesn't fit!

01:32:44.321 --> 01:32:45.270
There?

01:33:04.387 --> 01:33:06.110
- It's not working.
- What?

01:33:09.987 --> 01:33:11.874
Give me the pages from the book!

01:33:12.994 --> 01:33:14.685
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on it.

01:33:20.099 --> 01:33:21.277
I lost my sword.

01:33:23.555 --> 01:33:24.668
Here.

01:33:49.029 --> 01:33:50.305
Samuel?

01:33:50.885 --> 01:33:51.997
Legion.

01:33:57.030 --> 01:34:00.096
Severian, no! That's not Samuel.

01:34:22.695 --> 01:34:23.905
Duval, no!

01:34:28.872 --> 01:34:30.082
Kill him.

01:34:35.143 --> 01:34:36.256
Kill him.

01:34:48.904 --> 01:34:51.239
You are Samuel. It's alright.

01:36:03.181 --> 01:36:04.163
That's for Nathan.

01:36:04.877 --> 01:36:06.187
That's for El Jesus.

01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:10.571
And this is for Samuel.

01:36:45.263 --> 01:36:46.343
Jump!

01:36:48.976 --> 01:36:50.088
Jump!

01:36:53.424 --> 01:36:54.918
Have Faith.

01:38:38.166 --> 01:38:39.824
<i>And so it ended...</i>

01:38:40.055 --> 01:38:42.673
<i>I failed, he did not.</i>

01:38:44.183 --> 01:38:46.007
<i>Apostate,
unbeliever.</i>

01:38:47.702 --> 01:38:48.946
<i>Saviour.</i>

01:43:48.947 --> 01:43:49.947
