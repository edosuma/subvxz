MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH

02:21.475 --> 02:22.475
Hi, Alys.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.475
Sorry, I tried to call.
It went straight to...

02:25.600 --> 02:27.650
What is it?
A body's been found.

02:28.150 --> 02:29.650
The call came in just after nine.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.300
Where?
Near Groes Goch.

02:32.425 --> 02:34.275
The Detective Super's on site.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.050
She'll hold the fort
until you get there.

02:37.175 --> 02:38.350
OK. I won't be long.

03:07.625 --> 03:10.125
I feel slightly underdressed...!

03:13.200 --> 03:14.275
What have we got?

03:14.400 --> 03:16.250
White male, in his 30s.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.500
Body was found in the water
this morning.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.200
Do we have a name?

03:21.325 --> 03:22.325
Not yet.

03:22.450 --> 03:23.450
Any Mispers?

03:23.575 --> 03:24.575
Nothing.

03:29.050 --> 03:30.050
DCI John.

03:30.325 --> 03:31.325
You made it.

03:31.450 --> 03:36.375
The Policy Book will record that  
I've handed over SIO to DCI John...

03:37.575 --> 03:39.050
..at 11.06am.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.300
Thank you, ma'am.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.200
All yours, Cadi.

03:43.475 --> 03:47.375
The pathologist has concluded
her scene examination...

03:47.500 --> 03:50.125
..and the body is ready for removal.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.150
See you back at the station.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.450
Anything else I should know?

05:20.200 --> 05:22.475
Traces of blood found on the road.

05:23.175 --> 05:25.450
Possible site of the initial attack.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.600
Any sign of a weapon?
Nothing as yet.

05:29.275 --> 05:32.450
How far's the nearest village?
Three miles.

05:33.300 --> 05:37.100
Ma'am? We found it downstream.
Thank you.

05:40.250 --> 05:43.075
Well, I guess we can rule out theft.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.125
Ifan Williams.

05:47.625 --> 05:48.625
Williams?

05:49.125 --> 05:52.500
Great! That'll narrow it down a bit
around here.

05:53.375 --> 05:56.525
Speak to HQ.
See if we can get an address.

06:05.450 --> 06:06.575
What do you think?

06:07.075 --> 06:10.125
Injuries to the face              
and trauma to the back of the head.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.400
What about the markings on the neck?
Possible strangulation.

06:15.150 --> 06:18.475
I need to get him back to the lab.
Open him up...

06:18.600 --> 06:20.200
Don't let me stop you.

06:20.475 --> 06:22.325
Am I seeing you tonight?

06:39.300 --> 06:41.300
DISTANT SIRENS

06:50.225 --> 06:51.500
Lea, I'm here.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.575
At the front entrance.

06:55.375 --> 06:56.375
Where are you?

06:58.100 --> 06:59.225
Call me.

06:59.525 --> 07:03.200
Let me know if you're on the way  
so I can stall them.

07:14.475 --> 07:19.400
I'm sorry, Richard. We can't proceed
without the claimant present.

07:19.525 --> 07:21.650
Give her ten more minutes.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.275
She promised me she'd be here.
It doesn't look good.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.500
She can't be bothered to turn up...
There must be an explanation.

07:29.150 --> 07:30.500
Can we reschedule?

07:30.625 --> 07:33.100
Other people want that house.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.425
Please.

07:35.075 --> 07:36.250
I'll do my best...

07:36.375 --> 07:38.100
..as a favour to you.

07:38.400 --> 07:42.400
Make sure she's here next time.
She will be...

07:43.325 --> 07:44.325
Right.

07:45.450 --> 07:47.275
I'd better get back.

07:47.625 --> 07:48.625
Of course.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.500
SHE RINGS THE DOORBELL

11:57.425 --> 12:00.200
Mrs Siwan Williams?
Yes.

12:01.175 --> 12:04.475
DCI Cadi John
and this is DS Owen Vaughan.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.575
Can we have a word please?

12:24.475 --> 12:25.475
Come through.

12:32.625 --> 12:33.625
Take a seat.

12:37.450 --> 12:41.350
Can you confirm that              
you're the wife of Ifan Williams?

12:41.475 --> 12:42.550
Yes.

12:43.225 --> 12:44.525
What's this about?

12:45.225 --> 12:49.550
When did you last see your husband?
He came in for food last night.

12:50.050 --> 12:53.125
He went to the rugby club
around half six.

12:54.325 --> 12:56.050
What's happened?

12:58.475 --> 12:59.475
Just tell me.

13:01.175 --> 13:02.425
I'm afraid...

13:02.550 --> 13:06.050
..the body of a man was found
this morning.

13:07.425 --> 13:09.375
We've yet to identify him...

13:10.350 --> 13:13.125
..but we retrieved this
from the scene.

13:17.650 --> 13:20.600
Is it your husband's wallet?
Yes.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.575
Where...?

13:30.075 --> 13:33.500
The body was found in a stream
near Groes Goch.

13:35.325 --> 13:38.400
We're treating the death
as suspicious.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.200
I'm so sorry.

13:42.250 --> 13:46.625
You said you last saw him
at 6.30 yesterday evening.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.425
Yes.

13:48.550 --> 13:51.525
Were you concerned
when he didn't come home?

13:55.050 --> 13:56.050
Mrs Williams?

13:58.275 --> 13:59.450
My husband and I...

14:01.650 --> 14:03.450
We lived separate lives.

14:08.075 --> 14:14.050
Can you think of anyone who may have
held a grudge against your husband?

14:15.175 --> 14:17.225
Someone who'd want to hurt him?

14:19.150 --> 14:21.050
I'm sorry, I can't think...

14:22.550 --> 14:24.300
It's OK.

14:25.575 --> 14:27.250
I'm really sorry...

14:27.375 --> 14:32.325
..but I'm afraid we must ask you  
to view the body...

14:32.450 --> 14:34.400
..to confirm that it is Ifan.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.450
Can someone
come and look after your son?

14:41.050 --> 14:42.050
Guto!

14:42.275 --> 14:44.175
FRONT DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

14:44.300 --> 14:46.150
She'll have seen your car.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.425
What's happened?

14:56.500 --> 14:58.550
They found a body this morning.

14:59.050 --> 15:00.325
They think it's Ifan.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.175
Sorry, who are you?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.200
Mrs Mair Williams.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.400
I'm Ifan's mother.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.225
I'm sorry.
This must be a terrible shock.

15:19.175 --> 15:21.325
Do you mind...?
Of course.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.300
FRONT DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

16:32.475 --> 16:35.650
(RADIO) North Wales Police        
are appealing for information...

16:36.150 --> 16:39.075
..after an unnamed man's body
was discovered this morning.

16:39.350 --> 16:42.625
The body was found by a member
of the public near Groes Goch.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.300
An incident room has been opened...

16:45.425 --> 16:49.625
..and the police want anyone      
with information to come forward.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.350
Here he is!

17:02.475 --> 17:05.275
Oy! You were late again
this morning.

17:07.075 --> 17:10.375
Twenty minutes.
I need you up on that roof.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.150
Are you OK?

17:16.425 --> 17:17.625
Yes.

17:18.350 --> 17:21.275
MEN SPEAK POLISH

17:22.350 --> 17:24.350
THEY ARGUE IN POLISH

17:26.100 --> 17:27.425
HE SHOUTS IN POLISH

17:37.450 --> 17:39.075
Lea, it's me.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.275
Please phone me when you get this.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.575
I'm worried about you.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.125
We've put in the morphine driver.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.350
We're making her comfortable.

18:14.125 --> 18:15.300
Hello, Mrs Thomas.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.125
It's OK.

18:40.175 --> 18:41.175
I know.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.375
Rest now.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.575
Shall we do psalm four today?

19:02.350 --> 19:05.275
"Hear me when I call...

19:06.575 --> 19:09.125
..o God of my righteousness.

19:11.150 --> 19:15.075
Thou hast enlarged me
when I was in distress.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.575
Have mercy upon me...

19:19.550 --> 19:21.525
..and hear my prayer.

19:22.550 --> 19:23.625
Ye sons of men...

19:24.375 --> 19:28.375
..how long will ye turn my glory  
into shame?

19:29.325 --> 19:34.425
How long will ye love vanity
and seek after leasing?

19:37.250 --> 19:42.375
I will both lay me down in peace  
and sleep...

19:43.425 --> 19:46.625
..for thou, Lord...

19:49.150 --> 19:52.200
..only makest me dwell in safety."

20:08.475 --> 20:11.450
My friends were jealous
when I married Ifan.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.300
They thought it was a dream.

20:14.425 --> 20:16.325
The farmhouse... the land.

20:18.400 --> 20:24.275
I just wanted him... us,
to be happy.

20:28.225 --> 20:30.300
He made it impossible.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.450
It was like
he didn't have it in him...

20:35.575 --> 20:38.050
..to be happy with his lot.

20:41.150 --> 20:45.400
I always told him,                
"Hurt me as much as you want...

20:47.650 --> 20:50.200
..but don't hurt our son.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.400
We've assigned you
a Family Liaison Officer...

21:00.525 --> 21:03.100
..to help you through this.

21:05.575 --> 21:08.350
She's waiting outside
to take you home.

21:08.475 --> 21:11.200
I don't want anyone.
I don't need help.

21:11.325 --> 21:13.125
I'll make my own way home.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.075
What I need is time alone...

21:16.200 --> 21:20.475
..to work out                     
how to tell my beautiful boy...

21:21.625 --> 21:24.225
..that his father's dead.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.450
I checked the PNC.

21:56.575 --> 21:59.575
Ifan Williams
didn't have any previous.

22:00.075 --> 22:01.325
OK.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.200
What are you thinking?

22:13.275 --> 22:14.275
Violent.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.525
Feels targeted somehow...

22:19.525 --> 22:22.350
..out in the middle of nowhere
like that.

22:22.650 --> 22:25.325
Almost as if
someone was lying in wait.

22:28.225 --> 22:30.425
Where are we with house-to-house?

22:30.550 --> 22:33.075
The teams are still on the ground.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.200
The Williams family has land.

22:38.325 --> 22:40.275
Maybe they have money.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.650
Influence.

22:44.225 --> 22:46.275
Was that a problem for someone?

22:47.075 --> 22:49.275
Let's find out more about the farm.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.300
Alys, get the address
of the rugby club...

22:52.650 --> 22:56.150
..where Ifan Williams             
was drinking last night, please.

22:56.475 --> 22:59.300
We need a list                    
of everybody who was there.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.100
PHONE RINGS

23:07.175 --> 23:09.425
Oh, and find out more
about the wife.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.300
Hi, Beth.
I'm at the house.

23:14.425 --> 23:17.100
Are you on the way?
No. Something came up.

23:17.425 --> 23:19.100
I had to come into work.

23:19.225 --> 23:22.600
Bloody hell! We're handing
the keys over on Friday.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.300
Yes, but this is important.
This is important too.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.375
I only agreed to do this today    
so you could go to the interview.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.300
Yes, and I appreciate it.

23:33.550 --> 23:35.150
How did it go anyway?

23:36.200 --> 23:37.325
Yeah, it was fine.

23:38.225 --> 23:39.600
I'll be home later.

23:40.100 --> 23:41.600
I'll help, I promise.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.175
Do you know what, don't bother!

23:44.525 --> 23:46.425
Sorry to disturb you at work.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.125
I'll sort it myself.

23:58.075 --> 23:59.450
Hi, this is Beth's phone.

23:59.575 --> 24:01.050
Leave a message.

24:39.350 --> 24:44.500
I need to tell Guto.
Tell him later.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.100
What difference will it make?

24:55.125 --> 24:57.225
I need to talk to my son.

25:20.350 --> 25:21.350
Listen...

MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH

26:37.550 --> 26:39.300
Steady, for fuck's sake.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.525
Alright?
Yes.

26:47.275 --> 26:49.325
Fuck-fuck! Heads! Heads!

26:56.450 --> 26:58.450
All clear?
Clear!

27:00.525 --> 27:03.550
Fuck's sake!
You could've killed someone.

27:04.325 --> 27:06.625
Oy! What the fuck's going on
up there?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.175
Go home and get your shit together.

27:10.300 --> 27:14.300
I'll talk to him now.
You've got no lives left with him.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.500
I have.

27:17.650 --> 27:19.650
Go home before he gets up here.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
Hello?

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
Yes?

28:14.425 --> 28:17.200
DCI Cadi John.
This is DS Owen Vaughan.

28:17.325 --> 28:18.450
Can we have a word?

28:18.575 --> 28:20.200
What have we done now?

28:20.325 --> 28:24.050
Our licence is up to date isn't it?
It's not related to that.

28:24.175 --> 28:28.225
Are you aware that the body of a man
has been found near Groes Goch?

28:28.550 --> 28:32.150
That explains all you lot
around the estate today.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.125
The body of Ifan Williams.

28:34.425 --> 28:35.500
Did you know him?

28:37.575 --> 28:38.600
Yes, I knew him.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.275
What was he like?

28:43.475 --> 28:44.500
He was alright.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.200
Flashed the cash a bit.

28:48.325 --> 28:51.225
People aren't always keen on that 
around here.

28:51.350 --> 28:54.325
Did he give you any trouble?
He knew not to.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.550
We believe he'd been drinking
in here last night.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.275
Yes, he was here.

29:00.400 --> 29:04.050
He came in around seven,          
played pool, left around eleven.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.525
I need a list of everyone
in here last night.

29:06.650 --> 29:07.650
Right now?

29:08.200 --> 29:09.575
Yes. Right now, please.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.500

29:15.125 --> 29:17.125
Hiya.
Hey, it's me.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.625
What have we got?

29:19.275 --> 29:21.650
He may have been in the water
for five or six hours.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.575
That puts time of death...
..between 11pm and 1am.

29:26.225 --> 29:30.250
Fingernail scrapings suggest      
secondary DNA possibly the killer's.

29:30.525 --> 29:34.375
We'll have the results            
in the morning. That's all I've got.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.625
OK. Thanks, Rach.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.475
It's going to cost you...!

29:40.100 --> 29:41.100
I've got to go.

29:42.375 --> 29:43.600
See you tonight, OK?

29:45.650 --> 29:49.100
I take it that camera works.
Yes.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.275
We need the footage from last night.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.200
E-mail it to this address please.

29:58.350 --> 29:59.600
Is that a problem?

30:00.500 --> 30:01.500
No.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.300
Good.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.525
Thank you for your time.

30:41.450 --> 30:42.450
Lea?

30:47.175 --> 30:49.175
HE BANGS ON THE DOOR

30:50.125 --> 30:51.125
Lea?

30:52.525 --> 30:55.200
TV SOUND MUTED

30:55.525 --> 30:58.350
HE KNOCKS AGAIN
THEN OPENS THE DOOR

31:02.050 --> 31:03.225
Lea?

31:12.425 --> 31:13.425
Lea.

31:14.250 --> 31:16.375
Didn't you hear me knocking?

31:16.500 --> 31:19.175
Have you been sitting there all day?

31:20.575 --> 31:23.600
Don't you remember
what was happening today?

31:27.125 --> 31:29.575
Oh, God! I missed it, didn't I?

31:36.600 --> 31:39.425
I asked them
to rearrange the meeting...

31:40.475 --> 31:42.525
..but we're on thin ice.

31:44.475 --> 31:45.600
I'm sorry.

31:47.225 --> 31:48.475
I really am.

31:53.275 --> 31:56.475
Have you been using again?
No, of course not.

31:56.600 --> 31:57.600
Good.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.625
Don't play me for a fool, Lea.

32:02.375 --> 32:03.375
I won't.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.475
I promise.

32:09.450 --> 32:11.450
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

32:28.475 --> 32:29.600
You OK, Sion?

32:31.325 --> 32:32.450
I'm fine.

32:35.300 --> 32:37.600
The hawk's back.
Hmm?

32:38.100 --> 32:39.100
The hawk.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.400
Sion!
What?

32:43.100 --> 32:45.625
The hawk.
What are you talking about?

32:55.200 --> 32:56.200
Sorry.

32:59.050 --> 33:01.075
Sorry. I'm just tired, that's all.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.050
Have you been in my room?

33:15.325 --> 33:18.425
I thought I should wash them.

33:24.050 --> 33:26.400
Leave my things alone.

33:31.250 --> 33:33.250
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

33:53.450 --> 33:54.450
Beth?

34:13.200 --> 34:15.200
SHE SIGHS

34:40.050 --> 34:41.050
Sorry, Beth.

34:41.175 --> 34:42.450
Don't worry about it.

34:42.575 --> 34:46.125
It's not as if I've got
anything better to do is it?

34:47.500 --> 34:50.525
How much stuff is left in the shed?
A lot.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.650
You can sort this.

34:53.400 --> 34:58.075
You also need to find the keys    
to the windows and the doors...

34:58.200 --> 35:00.175
..and stop the house insurance.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.600
Give the kitchen and the bathroom 
a wipe down too.

35:03.100 --> 35:05.375
The new owners
will just rip everything out.

35:06.050 --> 35:08.050
Finish emptying the shed too.
Come on!

35:08.325 --> 35:09.450
No! I'm done.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.300
I'm tired.

35:15.150 --> 35:18.650
If I'm lucky, I'll be home in time
to put the kids to bed.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.475
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

35:22.150 --> 35:23.175
Just do your bit.

35:23.450 --> 35:26.525
I'll put a shift in tomorrow.
Why not tonight?

35:27.175 --> 35:28.650
I'm meeting Rachel.

35:30.475 --> 35:32.600
You've got your priorities straight!

35:33.275 --> 35:36.150
Have you told her
about the interview yet?

35:39.500 --> 35:44.100
Jesus, Cadi! For someone who's    
so clever, you can be really thick.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.475
Beth...!
No.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.125
CAR APPROACHES

36:44.350 --> 36:46.350
DOGS BARK

36:56.225 --> 36:58.225
RUSTLING

37:03.450 --> 37:04.525
What do you want?

37:09.475 --> 37:11.050
I heard about Ifan.

37:11.350 --> 37:13.250
Do they know what happened?

37:13.375 --> 37:17.100
What are you doing here, Dafydd?
I thought I'd check the stock.

37:17.450 --> 37:18.450
No.

37:18.575 --> 37:21.150
But there are jobs that need doing.

37:21.275 --> 37:22.625
Jobs I know I can do.

37:23.350 --> 37:25.150
I thought I could help...

37:27.625 --> 37:29.100
..that's all.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.650
What are you really doing here?

37:32.475 --> 37:35.550
Are you trying to make yourself   
feel better?

37:36.225 --> 37:37.650
None of this can be fixed.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.200
Just go.

37:44.625 --> 37:45.625
I said just go!

38:04.575 --> 38:05.575
Mm!

38:07.225 --> 38:09.100
I really needed that.

38:09.375 --> 38:10.375
Me too.

38:11.325 --> 38:15.450
How did it go with the solicitor  
this morning? Everything settled?

38:15.575 --> 38:16.600
Mm-hmm.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.325
All packed?

38:18.625 --> 38:19.625
Ish.

38:20.425 --> 38:24.100
You know the offer to             
come and live with me still stands.

38:24.225 --> 38:27.600
Yeah, I know but Elin
needs my support right now.

38:28.525 --> 38:31.050
Do you think
she's done the right thing?

38:31.350 --> 38:34.250
Asking me to move in
or going back to Rhydian?

38:36.150 --> 38:37.150
I don't know.

38:37.450 --> 38:41.200
She must think there's something  
worth saving there.

38:41.325 --> 38:46.150
Maybe the break did them both good.
Anything worth having is hard work.

38:49.225 --> 38:53.050
How did it go with Mr Williams?
It's all in the report.

38:53.175 --> 38:55.500
You don't want to hear about it now.

38:57.625 --> 38:59.275
OK.

38:59.575 --> 39:02.200
The blow to his head
didn't kill him.

39:02.325 --> 39:03.350
Asphyxiation.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.600
He drowned?

39:05.325 --> 39:08.250
No, the lungs were clear.
He was strangled.

39:09.050 --> 39:10.450
If I had to take a guess...

39:10.575 --> 39:15.125
..I'd say someone struck his head 
with a heavy object.

39:15.250 --> 39:16.400
A rock perhaps.

39:17.175 --> 39:21.575
A blow like that coupled with the 
shock would have disorientated him.

39:22.075 --> 39:25.200
He was probably pinned down
by the water.

39:25.325 --> 39:29.225
Bruising to the upper torso
and broken ribs suggests that.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.150
But Ifan was fit.

39:32.275 --> 39:33.275
He was strong.

39:34.350 --> 39:35.350
Thank you.

39:35.475 --> 39:38.400
Toxicology showed                 
high levels of alcohol in his blood.

39:39.050 --> 39:41.300
That, coupled with
the blow to his head...

39:41.425 --> 39:42.600
He didn't stand a chance.

39:44.250 --> 39:47.225
It was a violent
and sustained attack.

39:48.150 --> 39:51.600
Whoever killed him would          
stop at nothing until he was dead.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.400
TV

41:08.500 --> 41:10.500
LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER

41:20.200 --> 41:21.425
You can pay me later.

41:24.050 --> 41:25.225
I'm getting clean.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.150
You're a fucking legend.

41:27.325 --> 41:28.400
There's no cans.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.600
Where's the booze, Lea?
I've got nothing in.

41:37.100 --> 41:39.150
What the fuck's wrong with you?

41:44.225 --> 41:45.350
Bitch!

42:02.400 --> 42:04.400
THEY GIGGLE

42:19.475 --> 42:21.475
PHONE RINGS

42:25.100 --> 42:27.100
CADI SIGHS

42:28.175 --> 42:29.175
Vaughan.

42:32.075 --> 42:34.300
Hi, Vaughan.
Sorry to disturb.

42:34.600 --> 42:35.600
It's OK.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.200
I've been looking into the farm.

42:38.325 --> 42:39.650
Spoke to a local vet.

42:40.150 --> 42:44.350
Apparently, Ifan's farm was put   
under investigation last year.

42:46.425 --> 42:47.500
By who?

42:47.625 --> 42:51.175
DEFRA. There as an accusation
of animal neglect.

42:52.200 --> 42:56.375
According to the vet, a number    
of the animals had to be destroyed.

42:56.500 --> 42:59.425
I've sent you some files.
Last year?

42:59.550 --> 43:03.500
Was there a history?
No. The farm's record was perfect.

43:04.250 --> 43:06.425
Ifan's father was a stickler.
Old school.

43:07.100 --> 43:10.400
Who made the accusation?
It was an anonymous tip-off.

43:10.525 --> 43:12.300
OK. Thanks, Vaughan.

43:53.425 --> 43:55.425
TV BLARING

44:05.400 --> 44:06.650
Glyn?

44:10.625 --> 44:11.625
Glyn?

44:23.250 --> 44:24.400
Glyn!

44:29.575 --> 44:30.575
Glyn?

44:37.450 --> 44:38.450
Glyn!

44:44.100 --> 44:45.325
Just the milk, is it?

44:52.325 --> 44:56.425
Here you go.
Fifty, seventy five change.

44:56.550 --> 44:57.550
Thanks.

45:30.575 --> 45:33.100
Shit! Shit! Shit!

45:58.575 --> 46:00.150
What did you say?

46:01.100 --> 46:03.100
Nothing.
Yeah, you did.

46:04.275 --> 46:06.100
Oy! Come back here.

46:15.625 --> 46:16.625
I know you.

46:18.650 --> 46:21.300
Not got anything to say?
Leave me alone.

46:21.425 --> 46:24.325
What did you say?
I can't understand you.

46:27.350 --> 46:30.125
I said leave me alone...

46:30.250 --> 46:31.400
..wanker!

46:34.450 --> 46:36.600
Think you're fucking hard do you?

46:37.100 --> 46:38.100
Little prick!

47:00.475 --> 47:01.475
Glyn?

47:04.150 --> 47:05.275
Glyn!

47:08.075 --> 47:09.600
Glyn! What happened?

47:12.525 --> 47:13.600
I've cut my hand.

47:14.525 --> 47:15.550
What happened?

47:16.375 --> 47:18.325
Glyn, what did they do?

47:20.600 --> 47:23.250
You've got to tell me
when you're going out.

47:23.475 --> 47:25.650
I'm not a kid, Sion.
I can go out if I want.

47:26.275 --> 47:27.450
Let me see.

47:28.600 --> 47:29.625
Have they gone?

47:32.625 --> 47:34.225
Yeah, they've gone.

47:35.325 --> 47:36.325
It's over, OK?

47:39.050 --> 47:40.175
Mae o drosodd.

47:42.100 --> 47:44.300
I don't like it
when you shout at me.

47:46.575 --> 47:49.525
I'm sorry for shouting.

47:51.175 --> 47:52.175
Look at me.

47:55.275 --> 47:56.500
We're going to be OK.

47:57.575 --> 48:00.175
Dan ni'n mynd i fod yn iawn.

48:01.100 --> 48:02.625
Everything's going to be OK.
