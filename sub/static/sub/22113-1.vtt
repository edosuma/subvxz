00:02.085 --> 00:04.897
- TANDY: It's a nuclear meltdown.
- Let's get the hell out of here!

00:04.922 --> 00:05.968
TODD: <i>Why don't we
just move somewhere</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:07.139
where there are no nuclear plants?

00:07.174 --> 00:08.807
Then I guess we're going to Mexico.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.409
CAROL: <i>So are we going
to have some sort</i>

00:10.444 --> 00:12.344
of plan if we do see Pat?

00:12.379 --> 00:15.602
There is no way that
Pat could ever find us.

00:15.627 --> 00:17.126
(YELLING)

00:18.085 --> 00:20.552
(GUNSHOT, SCREAMING)

00:23.245 --> 00:24.878
Hi.

00:25.172 --> 00:26.525
I'm Pamela.

00:28.321 --> 00:29.671
Sorry. Not a great first impression.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.196
I promise I'm nice.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.998
Um, I-I hope you don't mind.

00:33.033 --> 00:37.474
I-I brought my dear friend,
uh, Rear Admiral Roy Billups.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.066
She's a nice ship. I can't
wait to take her out for a...

00:41.091 --> 00:42.074

- Aah!

00:42.099 --> 00:43.675

00:43.710 --> 00:45.544

00:50.716 --> 00:52.115
(GUN CLICKING)

00:52.660 --> 00:54.293
Uh.

00:55.355 --> 00:57.222
(GROANS SOFTLY)

00:57.608 --> 00:59.341
Is he dead now?

01:00.057 --> 01:02.794
I have a pretty surefire test.

01:04.953 --> 01:06.420
Call it.

01:06.445 --> 01:09.580
Time of death... 3:18.

01:12.954 --> 01:15.821
Another 3:18 over here.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.712
So, anyway, that was Roy.

01:21.138 --> 01:23.415
And again, Pamela.

01:23.549 --> 01:25.449
And, oh, this is Jeremy.

01:25.474 --> 01:28.409
Come here, Jeremy. Come here. (CHUCKLES)

01:28.737 --> 01:29.855
Oh!

01:29.890 --> 01:31.124
- Aw.
- Aw.

01:31.149 --> 01:32.415
PAMELA: Yes.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.493
There's my boy. (LAUGHS)

(SONG ENDS)

01:58.873 --> 02:00.239
That was very nice.

02:00.559 --> 02:02.330
- Thank you.
- Please have a seat

02:02.355 --> 02:04.155
- while the ceremony begins.
- Sure.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.127
Rear Admiral.

02:09.358 --> 02:10.757
What can I say?

02:11.246 --> 02:13.598
You died doing what you loved...

02:14.759 --> 02:16.735
being alive.

02:17.408 --> 02:19.471
What else? Um...

02:21.134 --> 02:22.719
Not really sure why I'm doing the speech

02:22.744 --> 02:23.821
on this one, to be honest.

02:23.846 --> 02:24.643
Uh, Pamela?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.044
- Hmm? No.
- No?

02:26.079 --> 02:27.445
- No.
- Okay then.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.980
Uh, Todd, little help, bud?

02:29.016 --> 02:30.806
Yeah, sure.

02:35.164 --> 02:36.922
Mind your back.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.498
(PANTING)

02:46.954 --> 02:48.554
Moving on.

02:48.666 --> 02:49.834
Oh, Pat.

02:49.859 --> 02:51.897
I think we can all agree that Pat was

02:51.922 --> 02:54.823
a pretty hard person to
nail down, death-wise.

02:55.166 --> 02:55.994
Now let's have

02:56.019 --> 02:57.652
a moment of silent prayer

02:57.761 --> 03:00.595
while I decapitate Pat with a shovel.

Oh, there we go.

03:34.531 --> 03:37.310
There we go. It's off. I got it.

03:37.335 --> 03:38.500
Oh, man.

03:38.535 --> 03:40.535
That was the hardest
decap I've ever done.

03:40.570 --> 03:43.838
And I mean, head and shoulders
above the last one. Boom.

03:43.874 --> 03:46.307
- (LAUGHS) That's funny.

03:46.343 --> 03:47.942
Thank you! Hot room.

that 'cause of the radiation.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.480
(LAUGHS)

03:52.516 --> 03:54.616
- PAMELA (LAUGHS): Radiation.
- TANDY: Pat,

03:54.651 --> 03:57.018
the severing of your
head is the first step

03:57.053 --> 03:59.154
in a two-step process to ensure

03:59.189 --> 04:02.557
that we will never be
surprised by you again.

04:02.592 --> 04:03.958
On to step two.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.360
TANDY: Okay, so let's

04:05.395 --> 04:07.061
send you south.

04:07.097 --> 04:10.832
(ENGINE REVVING)

Namaste.

05:01.709 --> 05:03.218
Hey, Melissa.

05:03.253 --> 05:06.147
How long till we get to Zihuatanejo?

05:06.288 --> 05:07.856
I... no idea.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.528
I've never driven a boat before.
I'm just kind of winging it.

05:10.553 --> 05:12.520
Well, can you wing it faster?

05:12.545 --> 05:15.563
We have a two-day-old baby
on board, I'm about to pop,

05:15.599 --> 05:18.934
and there's a nuclear
dust cloud hot on our tail!

05:18.959 --> 05:21.482
The whole situation is M.U.B.A.R...

05:21.507 --> 05:24.724
Messed Up Beyond All Regular-Standards.

05:24.749 --> 05:26.207
Is Regular-Standards hyphenated?

05:26.243 --> 05:27.909
- Regular-Standards is hyphenated.
- Well, I'm going

05:27.944 --> 05:29.744
as fast as I can, so...

05:29.779 --> 05:32.247
But you don't have to
worry, 'cause I got this.

05:32.282 --> 05:33.982
Okay, well, right now,

05:34.017 --> 05:36.251
you're giving me a
real booze-cruise vibe,

05:36.286 --> 05:38.219
and I need a little more Coast Guard.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.888
Fine, Carol.

05:40.621 --> 05:41.656
Geez.

05:41.953 --> 05:43.658
Thanks.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.597
TODD: <i>So you lost
contact with the drone.</i>

05:49.633 --> 05:50.832
What happened next?

05:50.867 --> 05:52.834
Hmm, well, I, uh, drove up to Malibu,

05:52.869 --> 05:55.170
and little did I know,
I had a stowaway...

05:55.195 --> 05:57.272
- this one.
- ERICA: Oh! So cute.

05:57.307 --> 05:59.340
It's been years since I've seen a dog.

05:59.376 --> 06:00.642
Can I hold him?

06:00.677 --> 06:01.943
I'm sorry, no.

06:01.978 --> 06:03.148
Anyway, when I arrived,

06:03.173 --> 06:05.313
you were all gone, and
then, Pat showed up.

06:05.348 --> 06:07.282
Oh, he was like a wounded animal.

06:07.317 --> 06:11.772
Just a mangled mass of
blood and pus, and it was...

06:11.797 --> 06:13.121
Oh, wonderful!

06:13.156 --> 06:15.690
I already have champagne,
but thank you so much.

06:16.893 --> 06:19.594
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Here you go.

06:20.449 --> 06:23.387
Slowly, I nursed Pat back to health.

06:23.412 --> 06:26.701
Some time went by, and our
relationship turned more...

06:27.477 --> 06:29.411
intimate. (LAUGHS)

06:30.507 --> 06:33.708
Sponge bath after sponge bath,

06:34.357 --> 06:36.311
the lines blurred.

06:36.701 --> 06:38.880
The sponge strayed.

06:39.341 --> 06:40.761
He was a very passionate

06:40.786 --> 06:41.740
and creative lover.

06:41.765 --> 06:44.032
He drew our entire
courtship on a pair of jeans.

06:44.103 --> 06:45.469
(LAUGHS)

06:45.608 --> 06:47.374
Isn't this romantic?

06:47.847 --> 06:49.480
(PAMELA LAUGHS)

06:49.705 --> 06:51.626
That's me washing his body.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.528
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

06:53.563 --> 06:55.630
There's our tongues.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.400
Looks like he loved you very
much before you shot him.

06:59.436 --> 07:02.403
I didn't think I could be any happier.

07:02.439 --> 07:04.839
And then the rear admiral showed up.

07:06.209 --> 07:08.710
First he was just a friend, but...

07:09.374 --> 07:11.579
then the lines blurred,

07:11.935 --> 07:13.734
tongues strayed.

07:13.835 --> 07:18.029
We became a sensual
human centipede. (LAUGHS)

07:18.764 --> 07:21.432
(CLEARS THROAT) So, how'd you find us?

07:21.614 --> 07:23.401
Pat saw smoke coming from your camper,

07:23.426 --> 07:24.909
and somehow knew it was you,

07:24.934 --> 07:26.594
and he flew into a rage,

07:26.630 --> 07:28.917
and grabbed his gun. He
said he wanted revenge.

07:28.942 --> 07:30.190
So, we followed him.

07:30.215 --> 07:31.399
I certainly wasn't gonna let him kill

07:31.434 --> 07:33.034
the very people that saved my life.

07:33.069 --> 07:34.435
Saved your life?

07:34.471 --> 07:36.070
When I found you with that drone,

07:36.106 --> 07:38.716
it just gave me something to live for.

07:38.741 --> 07:39.638
TANDY Hey,

07:39.663 --> 07:42.115
you're the one who
saved us by shooting Pat.

07:42.140 --> 07:43.011
No, no, no.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.412
- You saved me.
- Well,

07:44.447 --> 07:46.381
from one jean-art fan to another,

07:46.416 --> 07:48.750
agree to dungaree.

07:48.785 --> 07:50.685
(LAUGHING): Agree to dungaree.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.286
Oh, God.

07:52.322 --> 07:53.688
Oh, my goodness.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.957
Okay, I'm going to bed.

07:57.593 --> 07:59.394
Sleep tight.

07:59.429 --> 08:01.562
She's great.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.682
Hey. So, how's everyone doing?

08:05.707 --> 08:07.573
- We all getting settled?
- CAROL: Hardly.

08:07.598 --> 08:11.305
Pamela took the captain's suite,
and now we're all stuck here.

08:11.341 --> 08:13.741
If my water breaks,
it's going right on Todd.

08:13.777 --> 08:15.443
Hey, I'd be honored, Carol.

08:15.478 --> 08:18.079
If I could just piggyback
on Carol's point there.

08:18.114 --> 08:20.715
My baby's sleeping in a chum bucket.

08:20.914 --> 08:22.380
How you holding up, champ?

08:22.415 --> 08:23.581
Fine.

08:25.121 --> 08:28.589
Hey, look, I know a lot
of stuff went down today.

08:28.625 --> 08:31.676
It's not often that you
see a double homicide.

08:31.832 --> 08:34.448
That's why I think it's
important that we have...

08:34.472 --> 08:35.395
a talk.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.097
Sometimes when a bullet

08:37.133 --> 08:40.501
and a man's brain feel very
strongly about each other,

08:40.537 --> 08:43.004
they decide to take it
to the next level, okay?

08:43.030 --> 08:45.179
And that's called penetration.

08:45.213 --> 08:46.491
(LOUD METALLIC SCRAPING)

08:46.516 --> 08:47.816
Oh! Geez.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.580
Did we hit something, hon?

08:52.615 --> 08:55.183
- We did.
- All right, that's it.

08:55.218 --> 08:57.731
We're stopping until we
can see where we're going.

08:57.756 --> 08:58.632
Mm-mm.

08:58.661 --> 09:01.422
- No, we got to get to Zihuat.
- Well, we're not gonna get anywhere

09:01.458 --> 09:03.129
with a big friggin' hole in our boat.

09:03.153 --> 09:04.378
- Where's the stopper?
- I'm not stopping the boat.

09:04.379 --> 09:05.293
- No, I'm not showing you.
- Where is the stopper?

09:05.328 --> 09:07.528
- I'm not telling you.
- Where is the friggin' stopper?!

09:07.564 --> 09:10.264
- Fine!
- God.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.000
- Now which one of these is the anchor?
- (SIGHS)

09:13.036 --> 09:14.035
I don't know.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.805
- (SHIP HORN BLOWS)
- Horn.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.773
Lights.

09:19.211 --> 09:21.843
There you are, you little sucker.

09:26.479 --> 09:30.047
And that, my friend, is
how you anchor a boat.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.931
Oh, farts.

10:03.289 --> 10:04.922
Why can't we see land?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.713
Yeah. Little hiccup.

10:08.595 --> 10:09.834
Our anchor malfunctioned.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.306
We've been drifting all night.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.061
Gail, how does an anchor malfunction?

10:13.096 --> 10:14.818
Did it suddenly get not heavy?

10:14.843 --> 10:16.931
You know that button we had to press?

10:16.967 --> 10:20.607
Well, apparently, it's more of
a press and <i> hold</i> jobby.

10:20.632 --> 10:21.772
Thanks for telling me.

10:21.797 --> 10:24.606
- Are you telling me we have
no idea where we are? - Shush.

10:24.641 --> 10:27.675
Do you want Carol to hear you
and freak out and go into labor?

10:27.711 --> 10:31.179
- We got to keep this between ourselves.
- TANDY: Guys?

10:31.996 --> 10:33.448
We have a situation.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.033
(SIGHS)

10:35.262 --> 10:36.851
I broke the bathroom.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.888
How the heck did you manage to do that?

10:39.923 --> 10:43.024
We ran out of TP, so
I had to use my shirt.

10:43.211 --> 10:44.344
- Ew!
- Ew!

10:44.369 --> 10:45.927
Well, long story short, turns out

10:45.962 --> 10:48.930
that pipes on the boat are
not Beefy T compatible. FYI.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.700
Hey, bud, you done with my shirt?

10:50.725 --> 10:52.534
- Oh, you know it, yeah.
- Well, can I have it back?

10:52.930 --> 10:55.497
(SIGHS) Well, bad news
on that front, bud.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.057
Yeah. She gone.

10:57.116 --> 11:00.475
Oh, yeah, we-we lost her. Yeah.

11:01.283 --> 11:02.877
So you used two T-shirts.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.647
And a sock. It was a
multiple flush situation.

11:05.682 --> 11:06.881
Ah, not to worry.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.917
I arranged a backup.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.153
Shazam.

11:13.617 --> 11:14.823
Jeremy! No! No, no, no!

11:14.858 --> 11:17.926
No, no. Oh, bad dog.

11:17.961 --> 11:19.360
(SIGHS) Sorry, you guys.

11:19.385 --> 11:21.896
It wasn't designed to
hold the weight of a dog.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.832
TODD: Uh, where's land?

11:24.769 --> 11:25.733
It's there.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.569
You just can't see it right now.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.269
- GAIL: Yeah, it's an illusion.
- MELISSA: Yeah.

11:30.294 --> 11:34.572
The reflection of the water
blocks the view of the land.

11:34.597 --> 11:36.444
It's, uh, called...

11:36.857 --> 11:37.979
GAIL AND MELISSA: Davy Jones'...

11:38.014 --> 11:39.481
- Mirror.
- Mirror.

11:39.513 --> 11:40.105
Yeah.

11:40.130 --> 11:41.583
- Davy Jones' Mirror.
- Davy Jones' Mirror.

11:41.618 --> 11:44.124
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, know it well.

11:44.149 --> 11:45.587
Know it well.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.155
- TODD: Really?
- TANDY: Here, help me fish this

11:47.190 --> 11:48.356
- toilet paper out of the water.
- TODD: Yeah.

11:48.391 --> 11:49.457
TANDY: It's my favorite brand.

11:49.493 --> 11:50.959
Hey-o. (CHUCKLES)

11:51.321 --> 11:52.794
- PAMELA: Good morning.
- Good morning.

11:52.829 --> 11:55.497
Well, your eyes don't have
brows, but your nipples sure do.

11:55.532 --> 11:58.266
Thank you. Uh, speaking
of hairy situations,

11:58.301 --> 12:01.669
I did a, a little number on
the "B" room this morning, two.

12:01.705 --> 12:03.705
And it is fully out of commish, yeah.

12:03.740 --> 12:06.174
Hmm. I'm all ears.

12:06.209 --> 12:08.276
If you're all ears, then I
guess I can talk down here.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.644
- Or into here, or in here.
- (GIGGLING)

12:09.679 --> 12:11.145
Or into here, or into here.

12:11.181 --> 12:12.671
Or up here, or down here, over here.

12:12.696 --> 12:13.796
Tandy.

12:15.370 --> 12:18.019
Pamela. You look rested.

12:18.401 --> 12:20.154
I didn't sleep well at all.

12:20.190 --> 12:21.389
Ugh, wasn't it terrible?

12:21.424 --> 12:24.025
Sometimes a bed can be too big.

12:24.541 --> 12:26.108
So, what are you two up to?

12:26.133 --> 12:27.258
TANDY: Well, I was just, uh,

12:27.283 --> 12:29.898
telling Pamela that I put
one too many logs on the fire.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.008
(LAUGHS): Oh, "logs on the fire."

12:32.078 --> 12:33.201
I like that.

12:33.236 --> 12:35.746
Well, if you like that, I
got a bridge I could sell ya.

12:35.771 --> 12:37.739
I don't have a bridge,
I'm not a dentist.

12:37.774 --> 12:39.099
(LAUGHS): What? Like a bridge?

12:39.124 --> 12:40.909
Like in someone's mouth.

12:40.944 --> 12:42.911
(TANDY AND PAMELA LAUGH)

12:42.946 --> 12:44.712
(CACKLING)

12:44.748 --> 12:46.884
Yeah, he's not a dentist.

12:46.909 --> 12:47.753
TANDY: By the way,

12:47.778 --> 12:49.327
why do they call them dentists? I mean,

12:49.352 --> 12:50.919
do they specialize in dents?

12:50.954 --> 12:52.220
(LAUGHING)

12:52.255 --> 12:55.490
(LAUGHING): Dents. They don't.

12:55.525 --> 13:00.695
(LAUGHING): Yeah, it's priceless.

13:00.730 --> 13:03.731
I mean, they should call
them "toothists," am I right?

13:03.767 --> 13:05.833
- (LAUGHS): "Toothists."
- (CAROL CACKLES)

13:05.869 --> 13:08.770
(CACKLING)

13:08.805 --> 13:10.772
(WHOOPS)

13:13.076 --> 13:16.210
You're right! You're right!
You're right! (LAUGHS)

13:20.716 --> 13:22.750
Well, this has been very, very fun.

13:22.786 --> 13:25.942
Uh, again, broken toilet,
catch you on the flippety.

13:25.967 --> 13:27.426
Catch you on the flippety,
catch you on the flippety,

13:27.451 --> 13:28.523
catch you on the flippety,

13:28.558 --> 13:30.191
catch you on the flippety,
catch you on the flippety.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.360
- A little inside joke with us.
- Love it.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.228
I love inside jokes.

13:34.264 --> 13:36.230
Oh, yeah.

13:37.156 --> 13:39.767
Guess around I'll be seeing you.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.042
Yeah, because we had...
we went from here to here.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.310
- Okay, okay.
- Hey, uh,

13:49.335 --> 13:51.208
- what's the holdup?
- No holdup.

13:51.233 --> 13:53.915
- Just charting it up.
- Look, I don't

13:53.950 --> 13:58.589
want to talk out of turn,
but that Pamela is a real "B,"

13:58.614 --> 14:00.955
minus the stinger, plus the itch.

14:00.991 --> 14:02.957
Not only did she take the big room,

14:02.993 --> 14:05.159
she's all over my husband.

14:05.195 --> 14:06.961
She laughs at all of his jokes.

14:06.997 --> 14:09.759
And let's face it, he's
no Garrison Keillor.

14:09.784 --> 14:10.965
MELISSA: She sucks.

14:11.001 --> 14:12.166
I'm pretty sure she's
the one burning through

14:12.202 --> 14:13.568
our supplies, too.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.770
Uh, you think?

14:21.544 --> 14:23.077
There we go.

14:25.148 --> 14:26.514
(JEREMY BARKS)

14:26.549 --> 14:30.618
Jeremy, are you wearing
sunscreen? (SCOFFS)

14:31.192 --> 14:33.187
Told you a million times that
sunscreen's very important.

14:33.223 --> 14:34.689
There you are. (CHUCKLES)

14:34.724 --> 14:37.158
- Little rascal.
- MELISSA: Too late.

14:37.352 --> 14:39.867
CAROL: That settles it.
As soon as we hit dry land,

14:39.899 --> 14:41.829
we cut Pamela loose.

14:42.258 --> 14:43.575
GAIL: Amen to that.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.367
MELISSA: Fine with me.

14:47.255 --> 14:48.703
Don't you worry.

14:48.738 --> 14:50.371
Your mama will fix this.

14:50.407 --> 14:52.440
Mama fixes everything.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.881
Man, I can't wait till
we get to Zihuatanejo.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.182
Hey, Gail.

15:01.217 --> 15:02.817
How much longer?

15:02.852 --> 15:05.453
Well, if this wind holds,

15:05.488 --> 15:08.789
I would give it...

15:08.825 --> 15:12.960
four or maybe five nautical hours.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.829
You can tell the wind inside?

15:14.864 --> 15:16.797
Todd, my family has a rich history

15:16.833 --> 15:18.332
of boating while intoxicated.

15:18.368 --> 15:19.727
I think I know what I'm doing.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.169
Um, where's my breast milk?

15:22.205 --> 15:23.638
White Russians, anyone?

15:23.673 --> 15:24.972
Come on, we're on a cruise.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.841
Take the edge off. Enjoy.

15:26.876 --> 15:28.138
Oh, my God.

15:28.163 --> 15:29.844
That's my breast milk.

15:29.879 --> 15:31.812
Who steals from a baby?

15:31.848 --> 15:33.547
Well, it wasn't labeled.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.549
It wasn't in a breast.

15:35.585 --> 15:36.817
Tandy seems to like it.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.886
Mmm. Are you kidding?

15:38.922 --> 15:41.722
That was the <i> breast</i>
White Russian I've ever had.

15:41.758 --> 15:44.058
My compliments to the chef.

15:44.093 --> 15:45.893
Ugh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

15:45.929 --> 15:47.361
MELISSA: Land!

15:47.397 --> 15:48.863
Land!

15:48.898 --> 15:51.265
<i>- We did it!</i>
- GAIL: <i> Oh, my God.</i>

15:51.301 --> 15:52.900
(WHOOPS) We did it!

15:53.868 --> 15:55.236
What? I don't get it.
What's the big deal?

15:55.271 --> 15:56.904
Haven't we been following
land the whole time?

15:56.940 --> 15:57.923
Yeah and why

15:57.948 --> 15:59.874
is Mexico an island?

15:59.909 --> 16:01.767
Um, okay, y'all.

16:01.792 --> 16:04.011
There's kind of a good news/bad news

16:04.047 --> 16:05.780
type of situation here.

16:05.815 --> 16:09.116
The good news is we found land.

16:10.987 --> 16:13.587
And Melissa will be
fielding the bad news.

16:13.623 --> 16:15.723
All right? Take it away, hon.

16:15.758 --> 16:17.291
Thanks.

16:17.327 --> 16:18.824
Uh, we're lost.

16:18.856 --> 16:20.234
What? Are you kidding me? Seriously?

16:20.263 --> 16:21.535
How'd that happen?

16:21.560 --> 16:23.364
Well, when we dropped anchor last night,

16:23.399 --> 16:24.590
something went wrong,

16:24.609 --> 16:26.676
and, um, we drifted out to sea.

16:26.701 --> 16:28.879
- Geez.
- GAIL: And rather than get your panties

16:28.904 --> 16:30.913
in a collective bunch,
we just decided to lie

16:30.949 --> 16:32.448
and tell you we knew where we were.

16:32.483 --> 16:34.392
- Are you out of your minds?
- Cheese and rice.

16:34.417 --> 16:35.673
She was on anchor duty.

16:35.698 --> 16:37.253
And she was drinking like a fish.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.621
It's my honeymoon.

16:38.656 --> 16:40.353
Well, what do we do
now? W-We're out here

16:40.378 --> 16:43.135
in the middle of nowhere and
we're running out of supplies.

16:43.223 --> 16:45.189
Yeah, 'cause of someone.

16:47.498 --> 16:49.532
TODD: Maybe there's some
supplies on the island.

16:49.567 --> 16:50.933
Fresh water, coconuts.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.635
Ooh, a coconut breast milk smoothie

16:52.670 --> 16:53.870
would be next level.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.005
Uh, for Dawn, not for me.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.274
Virgin... the drink, not Dawn.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.509
Well, I presume she's a virgin as well.

17:00.545 --> 17:01.555
- Gross!
- Gross! Ew!

17:01.580 --> 17:03.546
- Geez, man.
- Oh, God. You know what?

17:03.581 --> 17:04.946
I-I just want to get off this boat.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.405
I don't care what the reason is.

17:06.430 --> 17:08.317
Okay, then it's settled.

17:08.353 --> 17:10.219
We're going to the island.

17:10.255 --> 17:12.454
Good. 'Cause it's starting to feel

17:12.490 --> 17:14.624
a little crowded on this boat.

17:21.714 --> 17:23.401
GAIL: Get ready for half an hour

17:23.425 --> 17:25.701
of Tandy making jokes about his dinghy.

17:25.737 --> 17:27.803
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Hey, Gail,

17:27.839 --> 17:29.721
guess what you're
sitting on right now, huh?

17:29.746 --> 17:31.010
Uh, Tandy, could I ask you something?

17:31.035 --> 17:31.807
Let that marinate.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.175
Uh, trust me, it'll be worth it.

17:33.211 --> 17:35.077
Yeah, go ahead, Pamela.

17:35.113 --> 17:36.913
Do you ever feel like
you need to do something

17:36.948 --> 17:39.348
even though if you did it,
everyone would hate you?

17:39.384 --> 17:41.851
Hey, literally, all the time.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.152
What do you do?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.154
Well, I'll tell you what I do.

17:45.454 --> 17:48.724
Caution. Wind. (LAUGHS)

17:49.235 --> 17:50.393
Thanks, Tandy.

17:50.428 --> 17:52.228
That's what I thought.

17:52.435 --> 17:54.202
You know what? I just painted my nails.

17:54.227 --> 17:57.233
Would you do me a favor and
untie that rope so I can get in?

17:57.584 --> 17:59.535
Un-tie to stop me.

17:59.570 --> 18:02.004
- Gail, Gail. Gail.
- (LAUGHS): Oh.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.439
Gail. Gail.

18:03.474 --> 18:04.674
It's my dinghy.

18:06.144 --> 18:07.677
CAROL: So, how do we
make this thing move?

18:07.712 --> 18:10.166
- MELISSA: We row.
- CAROL: Oh, that's fun.

18:10.191 --> 18:12.415
Okay. (GRUNTS, LAUGHS)

18:12.450 --> 18:14.383
Hey, I think you accidentally hit me.

18:14.419 --> 18:15.718
Sorry. (LAUGHS)

18:15.753 --> 18:17.183
God. Ow.

18:17.755 --> 18:19.288
Whoa! (SCREAMS)

18:19.806 --> 18:21.804
Sorry. I overheard what you
said about cutting me loose.

18:21.829 --> 18:23.292
It had to be you or me.

18:23.328 --> 18:25.148
I'll take real good care of Tandy. Bye.

18:25.173 --> 18:28.064
- (ALL SCREAMING)
- TODD: Hey!

18:28.099 --> 18:29.899
Tandy!

18:29.934 --> 18:32.702
- (ALL SCREAMING)
- TODD: Hey!

18:32.737 --> 18:35.276
- Tandy! No!
- Oh, my God.

18:35.301 --> 18:37.635
CAROL: Tandy!

18:39.010 --> 18:41.444
Tandy!

18:50.170 --> 18:51.007
(STAMMERS): Wh...

18:51.032 --> 18:52.577
(SCREAMS) What are you doing?

18:52.602 --> 18:53.835
What are you doing to me?

18:53.841 --> 18:55.307
I-It's called Latisse.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.702
It'll help with your brow growth.

18:56.727 --> 18:58.144
Why are you doing this?

18:58.179 --> 18:59.645
Eyebrows are important.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.856
They're like mustaches for your eyes.

19:01.881 --> 19:04.483
No, I mean, why are you kidnapping me?

19:04.519 --> 19:07.086
My wife and unborn
child are on that boat.

19:07.545 --> 19:09.574
Caution. Wind.

19:09.599 --> 19:11.098
Remember, Tandy?

19:11.123 --> 19:12.791
I am a woman that gets what she wants.

19:12.827 --> 19:15.594
And I'm confident that
as your brows grow,

19:15.630 --> 19:17.730
so will your affection for me.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.465
What are you talking about?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.734
I am married to Carol.

19:22.508 --> 19:23.636
For now.

19:24.312 --> 19:25.437
Wait. No, no, no.

19:25.473 --> 19:28.147
Come on. Pamela, please.
We have to go back.

19:28.172 --> 19:29.975
Relax, they'll be fine.

19:30.011 --> 19:32.266
I left them plenty of supplies.

19:32.291 --> 19:34.246
TODD: Let's see. We've
got, uh, champagne,

19:34.282 --> 19:35.948
a friggin' fondue pot.

19:35.983 --> 19:39.752
Sunglasses case with no sunglasses.

19:39.787 --> 19:42.588
Fancy napkins, uh... oh.

19:42.623 --> 19:44.190
A bunch of beef jerky.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.425
Oh, extreme teriyaki flavor.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.194
Let's see now.

19:50.779 --> 19:52.683
Yeah, that's definitely extreme.

19:52.708 --> 19:54.573
Champagne and beef jerky.

19:54.598 --> 19:57.446
This is like New Year's
at Ted Nugent's house.

19:57.471 --> 20:00.899
Oh, my gol. Did you see
what she did to Tandy?

20:00.924 --> 20:02.992
- I know.
- She is a monster!

20:03.017 --> 20:05.327
- Yeah.
- We're stranded out here.

20:05.352 --> 20:06.879
Calm down, Jasper.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.281
(MOUTH FULL): This one
doesn't have the same kick.

20:09.324 --> 20:11.533
Oh, it's just regular
teriyaki; that explains it.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.305
Todd, paddle!

20:12.330 --> 20:13.618
- Oh, I'm paddling.
- Come on.

20:13.654 --> 20:15.787
- (DAWN CRIES)
- Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.322
- It's gonna be okay.
- GAIL: Dawn.

20:17.358 --> 20:18.924
You know what? That's right, Erica.

20:18.959 --> 20:22.061
It is gonna be okay,
because if I know Tandy,

20:22.086 --> 20:23.595
he'll figure out a way to save us.

20:23.630 --> 20:24.896
We're gonna die out here. GAIL: Oh, boy.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.931
CAROL: No, no, no, no.

20:25.966 --> 20:27.132
- We are so screwed!
- We are.

20:27.167 --> 20:28.667
Okay, look. Guys, guys.

20:28.702 --> 20:30.438
We all need to just cool our jets.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.615
I know this situation
does seem dire right now,

20:33.640 --> 20:35.907
but look on the bright side.

20:36.275 --> 20:39.076
We have our very own island.
