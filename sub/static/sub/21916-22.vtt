Previously on Mystery Incorporated...

00:07.612 --> 00:09.947
Mine!

00:10.015 --> 00:11.949
Ahh! Uhh! Ahh!

00:12.017 --> 00:14.785
The freak of Crystal Cove
is my father.

00:14.853 --> 00:16.219
Mayor Jones?

00:16.286 --> 00:18.121
Nova?

00:18.189 --> 00:20.991
Welcome to the sitting room.

00:21.059 --> 00:22.225
What?

00:22.293 --> 00:23.773
I borrowed this book
from my mother,

00:23.795 --> 00:24.795
hoping it would help.

00:24.863 --> 00:26.430
"Supernatural curses

00:26.497 --> 00:29.166
and the extra-dimensional forces
behind them."

00:29.233 --> 00:31.435
You think maybe Nova's cursed?

00:31.502 --> 00:34.337
I am not Nova.
I am of the Anunnaki,

00:34.405 --> 00:36.840
interdimensional beings
that visit the planet earth

00:36.908 --> 00:38.742
every few thousand years.

00:38.810 --> 00:41.311
Scooby-Doo, your life
is in danger.

00:41.379 --> 00:42.980
Huh?

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.495 --> 00:59.296
Huh? Ooh.

01:01.466 --> 01:04.334
Oh, no, just when
I thought I was out,

01:04.402 --> 01:06.003
they pull me back in.

01:06.071 --> 01:08.706
Scooby-Doo, over here.

01:08.773 --> 01:09.974
He is after us.

01:10.041 --> 01:12.509
He will ruin everything.

01:18.149 --> 01:22.886
I don't want
to be here anymore.

01:22.954 --> 01:24.655
I want to go home.

01:26.891 --> 01:28.558
It too late, Scooby-Doo.

01:28.627 --> 01:30.193
He has found us.

01:30.261 --> 01:32.462
Ahh!

02:06.330 --> 02:08.799
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

02:15.410 --> 02:17.478
Oh! Get away!

02:17.545 --> 02:19.679
No! Run, boy!

02:19.747 --> 02:22.549
That scary monster
stole my eyes.

02:22.617 --> 02:24.084
Scooby-Doo, wake up.

02:26.287 --> 02:28.589
I can see!

02:28.656 --> 02:30.290
It's a miracle!

02:30.358 --> 02:32.593
Scooby-Doo, like, what's
gotten into you?

02:32.660 --> 02:34.928
The freak...the freak
of Crystal Cove is back,

02:34.996 --> 02:37.831
and he's in my dreams.

02:37.898 --> 02:39.433
And he's in there, too.

02:39.501 --> 02:42.002
We've got to do something.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.405
I don't know, guys,

02:45.473 --> 02:47.274
this seems like a crazy idea.

02:47.342 --> 02:49.109
Scooby could have easily
seen the picture

02:49.177 --> 02:50.377
on the back of my book,

02:50.445 --> 02:52.112
that's why he dreamed
about the author.

02:52.180 --> 02:54.548
Either way, it's the only
real lead we have.

02:54.616 --> 02:56.617
Besides, Velm, you've
been reading this

02:56.684 --> 03:00.654
"supernatural curses and the
extra-dimensional forces behind them."

03:00.721 --> 03:02.656
You must think there's
something to all this.

03:02.723 --> 03:04.124
I don't.

03:04.192 --> 03:06.693
I wasn't sure at first,
but I know in my head

03:06.761 --> 03:08.828
there must be some kind
of logical explanation here

03:08.896 --> 03:11.198
that doesn't involve
interdimensional aliens,

03:11.266 --> 03:12.566
real magic, or ancient curses.

03:12.634 --> 03:14.934
You're wrong, Velma.
It's all true.

03:15.002 --> 03:16.470
Shaggy, read the back.

03:16.538 --> 03:18.805
"The author, Horatio Kharon,

03:18.873 --> 03:22.442
"is a tenured professor
at Mistatonic university

03:22.510 --> 03:25.945
"and a world-renowned
hypnotherapist and occultist.

03:26.013 --> 03:28.549
"Professor Kharon went on
permanent sabbatical,

03:28.616 --> 03:30.384
"disappearing from
academic life,

03:30.451 --> 03:34.221
"and became a reclusive
living outside of Crystal Cove.

03:34.289 --> 03:36.790
And he hates people."

03:41.862 --> 03:43.096
This is it.

03:43.164 --> 03:44.565
If he's in Scooby's dream,

03:44.632 --> 03:46.933
he's definitely a man
we need to talk to.

03:49.036 --> 03:51.071
I still think this is crazy.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.374
Ahh! Go away.

03:54.442 --> 03:57.010
No one's home.
No one!

03:57.078 --> 03:59.346
Hello, there's obviously
someone home.

03:59.414 --> 04:00.980
You answered the call box.

04:01.048 --> 04:03.483
Darn it, I had when
I do that. Ahh!

04:03.551 --> 04:06.052
Go away anyway.
Go away!

04:06.120 --> 04:08.555
We can't.
You're in my dreams.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.024
You're dancing in my dreams
every night.

04:11.092 --> 04:12.626
What?

04:12.694 --> 04:14.994
All right, dog, talk.

04:15.062 --> 04:17.863
Did you see me?
Was it actually me

04:17.932 --> 04:20.466
in rooms and halls
of red curtains?

04:20.535 --> 04:21.834
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:23.438 --> 04:24.871
What's it all mean, doc?

04:24.939 --> 04:27.774
Quiet, blondie.
I've got to think.

04:27.842 --> 04:31.511
This could be it, the moment.

04:42.757 --> 04:44.090
The freak!

04:53.067 --> 04:54.501
Like, why is the freak
of Crystal Cove

04:54.569 --> 04:55.835
on your wall, professor?

04:55.903 --> 04:58.505
What? I don't know why.

04:58.573 --> 05:00.307
I see that horrible thing
in my dreams,

05:00.375 --> 05:02.041
my nightmares.

05:02.109 --> 05:05.812
If that thing is after you, dog,
then it's probably too late.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.381
You're already a goner.

05:07.448 --> 05:10.150
Like, hold on.
That's crazy talk.

05:10.217 --> 05:11.685
One more word out of you and...

05:11.753 --> 05:13.253
Yeah? And what?

05:13.321 --> 05:16.523
Um. Uh. Like, Freddy,
tell him what you're gonna do.

05:16.591 --> 05:18.792
Something bad, I guess.

05:18.859 --> 05:21.662
That's right, something
bad, I guess.

05:21.729 --> 05:25.165
Because nobody says crazy stuff
like that about my Scooby-Doo.

05:25.232 --> 05:26.667
Mmm.

05:26.734 --> 05:29.469
I apologize for my bluntness.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.070
I've lost something.

05:31.138 --> 05:32.939
That me you see dancing?

05:33.007 --> 05:34.508
That's the best part of me,

05:34.575 --> 05:36.843
trapped in the sitting room.

05:36.911 --> 05:38.378
Oh, give me a break.

05:38.446 --> 05:40.847
The sitting room?
What are you talking about?

05:40.915 --> 05:42.716
A world between worlds.

05:42.784 --> 05:45.852
A waiting room at a junction
between time, space,

05:45.920 --> 05:47.421
and different dimensions.

05:47.488 --> 05:49.556
In it, you'll find the answer.

05:49.624 --> 05:50.757
To what?

05:50.825 --> 05:53.293
To whatever it is
you need to find.

05:53.361 --> 05:56.563
I found a way to enter the
sitting room through hypnosis.

05:56.631 --> 05:58.765
But part of me
got trapped there.

05:58.833 --> 06:00.667
And if that freak
gets you, Scooby,

06:00.735 --> 06:04.103
when you're dreaming,
you will never wake up.

06:05.973 --> 06:08.141
How do we stop
this monstrous freak?

06:08.209 --> 06:09.710
You have to face it.

06:09.777 --> 06:12.145
Find the monster's
true identity,

06:12.213 --> 06:14.614
and it will be defeated.

06:14.682 --> 06:16.550
That just so happens
to be our specialty.

06:16.617 --> 06:19.152
You guys aren't really
buying any of this, are you?

06:19.220 --> 06:21.822
There is no such thing
as real monsters.

06:21.889 --> 06:23.923
Guys in masks, real monsters,

06:23.991 --> 06:25.158
doesn't matter to me,

06:25.226 --> 06:27.093
they're all going down.

06:27.161 --> 06:29.529
Hmm.

06:32.967 --> 06:36.302
You. Your skepticism
is your strength.

06:36.371 --> 06:37.971
Take this talisman.

06:40.307 --> 06:42.175
Give it to my other self
when the time is up.

06:42.243 --> 06:44.511
You have one hour.

06:44.579 --> 06:47.113
After that...

06:47.181 --> 06:49.516
There's no coming back.

06:49.584 --> 06:51.351
Let's hit it, doc.

07:33.928 --> 07:35.729
Where are we?

07:35.797 --> 07:36.730
This way.

07:36.798 --> 07:38.698
Come on.

07:46.808 --> 07:49.643
Like, Scoob, where's
your little dancing dude?

07:49.710 --> 07:52.078
- I don't know.
- Look.

07:54.081 --> 07:58.217
Mayor Jones, Cassidy Williams,

07:58.285 --> 08:00.420
ed machine.

08:00.488 --> 08:02.155
I don't understand.

08:02.222 --> 08:04.524
Oh, Daphne, we are soul mates.

08:04.592 --> 08:06.660
I never understand anything.

08:07.962 --> 08:10.831
Except maybe if the freak
of Crystal Cove is here,

08:10.898 --> 08:12.699
it's obviously one person,

08:12.767 --> 08:15.268
my not-dad,
the ex-mayor Jones.

08:15.336 --> 08:17.704
Is that right, not-dad?

08:17.772 --> 08:19.606
Not-dad?

08:20.675 --> 08:22.776
Capering candlesticks, Fred!

08:23.978 --> 08:25.378
Like, Fred's non-parental,

08:25.446 --> 08:26.646
what are you doing here?

08:26.714 --> 08:27.914
You're in prison.

08:27.982 --> 08:29.248
Only part of me.

08:29.316 --> 08:30.851
What you see are the best
parts of all of us

08:30.918 --> 08:32.785
that have been trapped here
in between worlds

08:32.854 --> 08:36.022
because of our association with the
cursed treasure of Crystal Cove.

08:36.090 --> 08:37.857
We've all been tainted
in one way or another

08:37.924 --> 08:39.292
by that darn treasure.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.595
Scooby, you have
one crazy dream.

08:41.662 --> 08:42.796
Thanks, Velma.

08:42.864 --> 08:44.464
If this is
the best part of you,

08:44.532 --> 08:46.466
why are you masquerading
as the freak

08:46.534 --> 08:48.201
and scaring my Scooby-Doo?

08:48.268 --> 08:50.804
Jumping juniper bushes!
That's not me.

08:50.872 --> 08:53.540
I got the idea for my freak
costume from my dreams,

08:53.608 --> 08:54.941
my nightmares,

08:55.009 --> 08:57.243
because that nightmare freak
is in here with us.

08:57.311 --> 08:58.545
I know who it is.

09:02.182 --> 09:05.351
The monster is free.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.633
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

09:39.820 --> 09:42.655
Daphne? Guys?

09:58.371 --> 10:00.840
Hold the phone.

10:06.213 --> 10:07.213
Huh?

10:07.281 --> 10:09.315
The conquistador helmet.

10:09.382 --> 10:11.350
The second key.

10:17.024 --> 10:18.291
Yah!

10:24.564 --> 10:27.566
Ahh! I could have gone
there and back twice already.

10:27.634 --> 10:28.914
What are you kids
doing in there,

10:28.969 --> 10:31.070
having a picnic?

10:35.542 --> 10:37.143
Jinkies.

10:37.211 --> 10:39.778
The Daro family.

10:42.249 --> 10:45.051
He's using the first key.

10:45.118 --> 10:46.452
Huh?

10:49.789 --> 10:51.190
Aah!

10:51.258 --> 10:52.658
Aah!

10:55.628 --> 10:56.896
Aah!

11:21.755 --> 11:23.022
Huh?

11:27.627 --> 11:28.861
Jeepers.

11:28.929 --> 11:31.797
The Benevolent Lodge
of Mystery.

11:32.632 --> 11:33.699
Aah!

11:33.767 --> 11:35.868
Aah!

11:48.048 --> 11:50.783
Huh?

11:55.655 --> 11:59.158
Ah, look, he has a little mask.

11:59.226 --> 12:01.794
And a lot of stink.

12:01.861 --> 12:03.996
- Pyoo.
- Huh?

12:06.366 --> 12:08.801
Hey, Scooby-Doo, like,
maybe we should take advantage

12:08.868 --> 12:11.270
of this crazy dream world
and snack up.

12:11.338 --> 12:13.705
You said it, Shaggy.

12:13.773 --> 12:17.977
Let's put the fee in fiesta.

12:36.063 --> 12:37.296
Raggy!

12:37.364 --> 12:40.466
The monstrous freak.

12:55.115 --> 12:57.516
Like, am I glad
we found you guys.

12:57.584 --> 13:00.086
That monstrous freak
seems to be everywhere.

13:00.153 --> 13:01.954
Guys, I'm ready to wake up now.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.038
Hold that thought, Velma.

13:05.058 --> 13:06.459
Scooby, what is it?

13:06.526 --> 13:08.394
Oh, it's Nova.

13:08.462 --> 13:09.862
I finally picked up her trail.

13:09.929 --> 13:12.031
Come on.

13:12.099 --> 13:14.200
I think I found Nova.

13:17.404 --> 13:20.206
And the monstrous freak
found us!

13:22.042 --> 13:23.242
This way.

13:31.084 --> 13:32.618
Through here!

13:43.449 --> 13:45.116
Aah!

13:56.596 --> 13:58.030
Look, gang, the sun.

13:58.097 --> 13:59.431
It's burning him.

13:59.498 --> 14:02.801
No, Shaggy,
it's something else.

14:02.869 --> 14:04.603
- Ahh!
- He's got Velma.

14:04.671 --> 14:05.771
Quick, grab her.

14:05.838 --> 14:07.105
Uhh!

14:11.044 --> 14:13.344
You're not taking our Velma.

14:13.412 --> 14:16.582
You're tearing me apart.

14:16.649 --> 14:17.950
Try to pull in unison.

14:18.017 --> 14:19.417
Get the freak into the light.

14:19.485 --> 14:22.153
- Now!
- Uhh!

14:28.127 --> 14:29.962
Like, the talisman.

14:31.564 --> 14:33.732
That's it, I quit.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.634
I don't understand any of this.

14:35.702 --> 14:38.904
I have spent my whole life
believing in facts and clues,

14:38.972 --> 14:42.007
but we're in some dream world
fighting a nightmare monster.

14:42.075 --> 14:43.609
It doesn't make sense.

14:43.676 --> 14:45.410
I want it to make sense.

14:45.478 --> 14:48.647
I need it to make sense.

14:48.715 --> 14:51.282
It's ok.
It's all right, Velm.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.284
Sometimes you have to
not think.

14:53.352 --> 14:56.989
Sometimes you have to feel your way
in order for things to make sense.

14:57.056 --> 14:59.691
You are perfect, all of you.

15:02.428 --> 15:06.898
It is easy to see that you are the
true inheritors of the originals.

15:06.966 --> 15:10.002
Nova, I've been looking
all over for you.

15:10.069 --> 15:14.940
We have been hiding here
from the monstrous freak.

15:15.008 --> 15:18.944
It is very determined
to let none leave this world.

15:19.012 --> 15:23.181
I can see that you have learned much
here in the world between worlds.

15:23.249 --> 15:25.884
Now you must take
that knowledge back with you.

15:25.952 --> 15:28.453
We're not going anywhere.
We can't leave.

15:28.521 --> 15:31.056
That doohickey that we're supposed
to give the little dude here,

15:31.124 --> 15:32.891
like, that crazy freak took it.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.192
The talisman?

15:34.260 --> 15:35.927
We need it to get out
of the dream world.

15:35.995 --> 15:37.562
You mean we're trapped in here?

15:37.630 --> 15:39.397
And Nova's talking!

15:39.465 --> 15:41.399
Velma, that's not Nova.

15:41.467 --> 15:44.002
She's possessed by an
interdimensional alien, remember?

15:44.070 --> 15:45.737
Try to keep up, Velma.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.908
What was I thinking?

15:49.976 --> 15:52.010
What are you kids
doing in there?

15:52.078 --> 15:54.746
We just have to get the talisman
back so we can go home.

15:54.814 --> 15:57.082
But, Fred, how do you trap
a real monster

15:57.150 --> 15:58.383
in a dream world?

15:58.450 --> 15:59.918
No worries.

15:59.986 --> 16:02.320
This freak thing just
showed us its Achilles' heel.

16:02.388 --> 16:04.222
Whatever's on top
of that pyramid

16:04.290 --> 16:05.390
could bring him down.

16:05.457 --> 16:08.093
Come on, gang.
It's trappin' time,

16:08.161 --> 16:11.596
interdimensional reality style.

16:17.436 --> 16:20.371
I really, really hate
always being the bait.

16:20.439 --> 16:23.175
Me, too.
It is so unfair.

16:33.052 --> 16:38.023
Now let's see who this
monstrous freak really is.

16:40.426 --> 16:42.027
It's...it's...

16:42.095 --> 16:43.128
Who is that?

16:43.196 --> 16:44.763
If I'm not mistaken,

16:44.831 --> 16:47.766
El Aguirre, the captain
of the Spanish conquistadors.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.268
El Aguirre? But why?

16:50.336 --> 16:53.605
The truth is simple.

16:53.672 --> 16:56.041
I did not want you
to discover how to destroy

16:56.109 --> 16:58.977
the evil entity buried deep
beneath Crystal Cove.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.380
Like, that doesn't
make any sense.

17:02.448 --> 17:03.915
I thought you'd be
the first person

17:03.983 --> 17:05.415
who'd want that thing
destroyed.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.318
No, do you not see?

17:07.386 --> 17:09.788
If you destroy the entity,
myself and my men

17:09.856 --> 17:11.757
will be set free
from this endless curse.

17:11.824 --> 17:14.159
We should never be set free.

17:14.227 --> 17:17.229
We must pay for all the horrible
atrocities we committed

17:17.296 --> 17:19.131
while in service to the entity.

17:22.201 --> 17:25.336
I can still hear
their screaming.

17:25.404 --> 17:28.073
All the screams
of the innocent ones.

17:28.141 --> 17:29.941
No. No!

17:30.009 --> 17:31.977
We must pay forever.

17:32.044 --> 17:34.012
We can never be set free.

17:34.080 --> 17:39.084
Ok. Like, the old Spanish dude
is a little loco in the cabeza.

17:39.152 --> 17:42.154
Do not fret.
All can be undone.

17:42.221 --> 17:43.822
All can be forgiven.

17:43.890 --> 17:47.993
Yes. Yes, all can
be forgiven.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.795
That reminds me.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.230
Uh, be right back.

18:00.606 --> 18:02.407
They're not gonna make it.

18:02.474 --> 18:04.442
I'll never be whole again.

18:04.510 --> 18:06.144
It's over.

18:06.212 --> 18:07.645
All over!

18:12.351 --> 18:14.619
Unless...

18:23.462 --> 18:26.364
It was centuries
of your earth time ago.

18:26.432 --> 18:31.136
They called themselves
Ma Cuben Sun Macul,

18:31.204 --> 18:33.872
which means the hunters
of secrets.

18:33.940 --> 18:37.642
They were the original group
manipulated by the evil entity.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.244
There were more to follow.

18:39.312 --> 18:42.547
The evil one has forever
been manipulating hapless souls

18:42.614 --> 18:45.050
throughout history in hopes
they would set him free

18:45.117 --> 18:47.085
from his crystal sarcophagus.

18:49.555 --> 18:52.457
The Mystery Incorporated
that preceded yours,

18:52.524 --> 18:55.327
the Daro family's
Mystery Fellowship,

18:55.394 --> 18:58.730
the Benevolent Lodge
of Mystery,

18:58.797 --> 19:02.600
the Mystery Gang with
their bull Tiny,

19:02.668 --> 19:07.038
the Alianzo Mysterio
and their pet skunk El Fuchy,

19:07.106 --> 19:10.075
and Fraternitas Mysterium.

19:10.142 --> 19:12.844
Always 4 humans and animal.

19:12.912 --> 19:17.115
The Mayan group of friends, the hunters
of secrets, were the very first.

19:17.183 --> 19:19.217
They were the most pure.

19:19.285 --> 19:21.253
They realized they were
being manipulated

19:21.320 --> 19:23.688
and instead of setting
the evil one free,

19:23.756 --> 19:29.327
they were about to destroy it
with the heart of the jaguar.

19:33.132 --> 19:36.868
Alas, they were interrupted
by El Aguirre and his men

19:36.936 --> 19:39.137
who came and took
the crystal sarcophagus away

19:39.205 --> 19:41.539
thinking it to be
a great treasure.

19:47.113 --> 19:49.114
You're the smart one, Velma.

19:49.181 --> 19:50.481
It's time to go.

19:50.549 --> 19:52.483
Give my other half
the talisman.

19:52.551 --> 19:54.953
Complete the bridge and I can
bring you all home.

19:55.021 --> 19:57.122
Velma, listen!

19:57.189 --> 19:58.489
Hear me!

19:58.557 --> 20:00.658
Time's up!

20:00.726 --> 20:02.827
Jinkies!
We're out of time.

20:12.204 --> 20:13.471
Wah!

20:13.539 --> 20:15.706
I want you to know
that whatever happened,

20:15.774 --> 20:17.442
I'm not really mad at you.

20:17.509 --> 20:19.777
Despite the whole stealing
me as an innocent baby

20:19.845 --> 20:21.346
and lying to me my entire life,

20:21.414 --> 20:23.815
you were a great dad.

20:26.518 --> 20:27.785
I forgive you.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.787
You've always been
and still are

20:29.855 --> 20:32.357
the only real father
I've ever know.

20:32.425 --> 20:34.625
Leaping late lilies, Fred.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.928
I am so proud of you.

20:36.996 --> 20:38.430
Even if you don't
break the spell,

20:38.497 --> 20:40.131
even if you can't
turn it all around

20:40.199 --> 20:42.300
by destroying that evil entity,

20:42.368 --> 20:45.170
I want you to know that
having you as my son

20:45.237 --> 20:47.605
was the absolute
best part of my life.

20:47.673 --> 20:50.141
You were always
the best part of me.

20:50.209 --> 20:51.909
Freddy, we have to go.

20:51.978 --> 20:53.478
Yeah, like, time's up.

20:53.545 --> 20:56.181
If we don't leave now,
we don't leave ever.

20:57.383 --> 21:00.318
Ha ha ha!
I am going home.

21:00.386 --> 21:03.154
Ha ha ha!

21:03.222 --> 21:06.057
Find the heart
of the jaguar, Scooby-Doo.

21:06.125 --> 21:08.793
It is the only way
you shall defeat the evil

21:08.861 --> 21:11.496
that is buried deep
beneath Crystal Cove.

21:11.563 --> 21:14.632
Use the heart of the jaguar.

21:20.606 --> 21:23.475
I'm whole again.
I'm whole!

21:23.542 --> 21:26.844
And I couldn't have done it
without you meddling kids.

21:26.912 --> 21:30.982
You beautiful, brave,
wonderful meddling kids.

21:33.019 --> 21:35.520
Jinkies. After all
we've been through,

21:35.587 --> 21:38.356
only to find out that
we've been manipulated

21:38.424 --> 21:39.924
by some evil entity.

21:39.992 --> 21:42.293
Is that the only reason
we're together?

21:42.361 --> 21:46.731
Like, yeah. Maybe
we don't even like each other.

21:46.798 --> 21:49.834
Gang, what are we gonna do?

21:49.902 --> 21:52.270
The heart of a jaguar.

21:52.338 --> 21:56.841
We have to find
the heart of a jaguar.
