01:29.242 --> 01:30.701
Don't fucking touch it.

01:39.461 --> 01:41.963
We'll take care
of it from here.

01:52.349 --> 01:55.352
This shit better be
spotless when I get back.

02:06.070 --> 02:08.698
Here you go. It's okay.

02:10.032 --> 02:12.076
Wow. It's tight in here
with three people, huh?

02:12.202 --> 02:14.538
Tell me how it's also dark at
night and cold in the snow.

02:15.872 --> 02:17.999
Hey, hey, you're gonna need
to clean that up.

02:18.082 --> 02:20.122
That's all you gotta say to
the mother of your child?

02:20.168 --> 02:21.289
You have to be quiet, please.

02:21.336 --> 02:23.880
I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Can I do anything or...

02:24.047 --> 02:27.091
So what do you want? Hurry it up.
It fucking stinks in here.

02:27.217 --> 02:29.058
I have a plan. It's
a pretty good one, I think.

02:29.135 --> 02:30.387
You see, I told you.

02:30.554 --> 02:31.638
So there's this
thing called furlough,

02:31.721 --> 02:33.056
where they grant an inmate
temporary leave...

02:33.139 --> 02:34.391
I know what furlough is.

02:34.516 --> 02:36.601
They don't actually give
that shit to anyone. Ever.

02:36.726 --> 02:38.395
It's rare, yes.
But my uncle knows the warden.

02:38.478 --> 02:39.688
I think we can make an appeal.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.981
For the love of your poor,
long-suffering grandma.

02:42.065 --> 02:43.066
Mama Lourdes?

02:43.191 --> 02:46.570
Ay, Mama Lourdes is so mean,
she's gonna outlive all of us.

02:46.695 --> 02:50.532
He's talking about a fake
abuela, who's really sick.

02:50.615 --> 02:52.659
Then fake abuela fake dies.

02:52.741 --> 02:55.181
And you get to leave for the
weekend to go to her fake funeral.

02:55.744 --> 02:57.330
What's that have to
do with the baby?

02:57.414 --> 02:59.999
Ay, Dios mio, between
the two of yous,

03:00.083 --> 03:01.763
this child's gonna be
100% retard. I swear.

03:02.711 --> 03:05.213
When you start to show
and we can't hide it anymore,

03:05.296 --> 03:07.507
we tell everyone
that you got your pussy

03:07.632 --> 03:09.884
fucked while you
were on furlough.

03:10.009 --> 03:13.762
Peg-leg Pete here gets to keep his
job and no one knows shit. Get it?

03:13.930 --> 03:15.432
Yo, that shit is smart.

03:15.557 --> 03:16.558
Thanks.

03:17.601 --> 03:18.976
But it ain't never gonna work.

03:19.102 --> 03:21.104
Like you're the first person
who ever tried this game.

03:21.187 --> 03:24.441
Well, it's all we have, right?
So, I'll submit it today.

03:24.608 --> 03:27.193
Just do your best
to hide the puking.

03:37.995 --> 03:39.205
Hi.

03:39.664 --> 03:42.584
Larry Bloom. I'm here
for Urban Tales.

03:43.793 --> 03:46.212
Great. You can have a seat.
Maury's not quite ready for you.

03:46.296 --> 03:48.336
Can I get you anything while you wait?
Water? Coffee?

03:54.011 --> 03:55.138
Sir?

03:55.930 --> 03:58.808
Sorry... Yes. Water,
please. Would be great.

03:58.891 --> 04:01.645
Got to keep the vocal
chords hydrated, you know?

04:02.771 --> 04:03.854
Too eager?

04:03.980 --> 04:05.231
Just a little.
Okay. Thank you.

04:24.167 --> 04:26.002
You here for Urban Tales?

04:26.085 --> 04:27.671
I am, yeah. Ben Palmer.

04:27.837 --> 04:29.464
Larry Bloom.

04:30.214 --> 04:32.008
Does your boyfriend
live far away?

04:34.844 --> 04:39.890
My fiancee is in prison.
She's a she. She's a girl.

04:40.016 --> 04:42.185
The cardigan threw me.

04:42.310 --> 04:45.855
So, prison? That's gotta be
some rough stuff, huh?

04:46.690 --> 04:50.735
Yeah.
It's very difficult.

04:50.985 --> 04:52.529
How about you?

04:52.612 --> 04:55.948
My husband's a scientist down
at McMurdo in Antarctica.

04:56.032 --> 04:58.368
So, it's a different
kind of prison.

04:58.493 --> 05:02.872
Jeez. Yeah, that's like, as
long distance as you can get.

05:03.039 --> 05:05.834
Haven't seen him
in almost two years.

05:07.335 --> 05:08.961
Where's your fiancee locked up?

05:09.086 --> 05:10.714
She's upstate.

05:10.839 --> 05:15.009
I get to see her,
you know, pretty often.

05:16.594 --> 05:17.679
Ready, guys?

05:19.764 --> 05:21.725
It's gonna be a great show.

05:23.017 --> 05:25.812
I'm sorry...
Okay. Thanks.

05:26.020 --> 05:28.398
Hey, heard your dude's
gonna be on the radio tomorrow.

05:28.857 --> 05:30.567
What? Where did
you hear that?

05:32.527 --> 05:37.407
Well, a little birdie who listens to
NPR in her transport van told me.

05:37.532 --> 05:38.616
You didn't know?

05:38.742 --> 05:39.826
No, I had no idea.

05:39.908 --> 05:42.161
I have not been able to get
in touch with him for a week.

05:42.245 --> 05:44.581
Maybe he's cheating
on me with Maury Kind.

05:44.913 --> 05:48.585
Oh. Then you'd both be gay.
So post-modern.

05:48.877 --> 05:50.628
You know, it's like
the sole purpose

05:50.754 --> 05:52.547
of these things is
to end up tangled.

05:52.672 --> 05:55.132
Why has no one
figured out a solution yet?

05:55.299 --> 05:56.634
All right, Seinfeld.
Calm down.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.321
You in a hurry to
hang yourself with it?

06:01.305 --> 06:04.851
Less than 24 hours
and you're making a joke?

06:04.933 --> 06:06.310
Someone is dead.

06:06.561 --> 06:09.522
Jesus Christ. You having
your red dot special?

06:09.606 --> 06:12.609
Communists in your
funhouse? Crimson tide?

06:13.610 --> 06:14.943
Okay, perfect.

06:15.027 --> 06:18.531
By all means, attribute my legitimate
feelings of sadness to menses.

06:18.907 --> 06:20.491
You really just say menses?

06:20.617 --> 06:21.618
That's gross.

06:21.743 --> 06:22.744
You're gross.

06:22.869 --> 06:23.912
Great comeback.

06:23.994 --> 06:27.164
Excuse me, inmate?
What did you say to me?

06:28.625 --> 06:31.461
Hey, Chapman. Oh!
Pick your battles.

06:32.629 --> 06:35.381
Didn't your vacation on the sunny
island of SHU teach you anything?

06:35.548 --> 06:37.926
Are they really not gonna
have a memorial for her?

06:38.050 --> 06:39.469
Are you kidding?

06:39.636 --> 06:42.764
The administration cares about
burying the story, not her.

06:43.013 --> 06:44.432
Well, fuck that.

06:45.099 --> 06:50.396
Everybody deserves a funeral. I'm
gonna organize something for her.

06:50.563 --> 06:52.816
You barely knew her.
What are you doing?

06:54.066 --> 06:55.610
I'm untangling.

06:56.152 --> 06:59.113
Have you ever seriously
considered suicide?

07:01.658 --> 07:04.160
What are you?
One of those hippy-dippy docs?

07:04.285 --> 07:06.704
Like, if I told you I was
dreaming about a pineapple

07:06.830 --> 07:09.916
you would ask me if I wanna
have sex with my mama? Hmm?

07:10.166 --> 07:11.542
Have you experienced
any of the following

07:11.668 --> 07:13.127
during the last two weeks?
Anxiety?

07:13.252 --> 07:15.755
Of course I've
experienced anxiety.

07:15.922 --> 07:17.924
You think this is an easy job?

07:18.007 --> 07:21.511
Having to heal the whole world
with just these 10 fingers.

07:21.636 --> 07:22.679
It's a lot of pressure.

07:22.846 --> 07:23.847
Loss of appetite?

07:23.972 --> 07:26.683
What does that have to do with anything?
Hmm? Doc?

07:27.517 --> 07:31.228
You know, it's people like you
that give America a bad name.

07:31.354 --> 07:34.691
You all go squawking around talking
about guns being dangerous,

07:34.774 --> 07:38.361
when all you want to do is shove
pills down people's throats.

07:38.444 --> 07:41.823
When all they need is
just a little bit of faith.

07:42.490 --> 07:46.911
Ask me about my appetite. Why? Because
I'm just naturally kind of skinny?

07:47.036 --> 07:49.038
Miss Doggett, if you could
please just answer the question.

07:49.163 --> 07:51.081
I have answered the question.

07:51.207 --> 07:54.377
I'm not crazy. I'm chosen.
There's a difference.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.921
Now, if you just let
me out of this cage,

07:57.046 --> 07:59.549
we can both get
back to our jobs.

08:01.425 --> 08:02.802
Please?

08:02.886 --> 08:05.304
You've stated that you believe God is
speaking to you and allowing you...

08:05.388 --> 08:10.393
I don't have
to believe, Doc. I know.

08:10.476 --> 08:12.228
Why don't you just go ask
some of the other girls?

08:12.353 --> 08:13.938
They're all gonna tell you.

08:14.063 --> 08:19.986
I've been healing ailments left and right.
Miracle. There's proof.

08:20.236 --> 08:21.571
These hallucinations
you've been having...

08:21.738 --> 08:24.198
I'm not having
fucking hallucinations!

08:24.323 --> 08:26.784
I don't belong in here!
Come on!

08:26.951 --> 08:28.077
Miss Doggett...

08:28.202 --> 08:29.286
I'm not a freaking animal,
get me out!

08:29.453 --> 08:30.747
Miss Doggett,
when you calm down

08:30.872 --> 08:32.916
I will get you on a sedative,
take you to a nice room...

08:33.041 --> 08:37.503
I don't need any sedatives!
Jesus has my back!

08:37.587 --> 08:40.048
Please! Doc!

08:41.591 --> 08:44.134
Doc, come back!

08:47.096 --> 08:50.850
An inmate is dead and a crippled
delinquent was attacked.

08:50.934 --> 08:54.270
What happened yesterday
was an epic fuckup, people.

08:54.395 --> 08:56.105
All of you better get
on your knees tonight

08:56.188 --> 08:59.358
and pray that none of those kids'
families sue the shit out of the DOC,

08:59.442 --> 09:01.778
because we're all out
of a job if they do.

09:01.861 --> 09:04.447
You think she's gonna get
on her knees tonight?

09:04.572 --> 09:06.824
Something funny, gentlemen?

09:06.950 --> 09:07.950
Hi. I was just wondering,

09:07.992 --> 09:09.577
is there gonna be an investigation
into Miller's death?

09:09.660 --> 09:10.954
Our manual says that
the FBI is supposed

09:11.079 --> 09:12.359
to be informed
anytime there's...

09:12.455 --> 09:13.831
This was
a clear-cut suicide case.

09:13.957 --> 09:15.332
There's nothing to investigate.

09:15.458 --> 09:18.795
The body was cremated.
May she rest in peace.

09:20.964 --> 09:25.468
So, the warden has asked us to draft
a memo to distribute to the inmates,

09:26.677 --> 09:30.640
telling them that we care, the
services that are available, etc.

09:30.723 --> 09:32.016
You've got to be kidding me.

09:32.475 --> 09:35.478
I'm sorry, but how is this a
good use of our time, exactly?

09:35.561 --> 09:36.562
Excuse me?

09:36.938 --> 09:39.607
I don't know about the rest of
you, but I've got real work to do.

09:39.690 --> 09:41.358
Sit down.

09:42.151 --> 09:43.653
Unless you want me
to tell the warden

09:43.778 --> 09:45.279
that you refused
to participate.

09:49.158 --> 09:50.534
So, who wants to begin?

09:51.327 --> 09:53.370
We should offer our
condolences, right?

09:53.496 --> 09:55.247
Insurance companies
always tell you not

09:55.372 --> 09:57.166
to apologize when
you're in an accident.

09:57.249 --> 09:58.751
Admits fault.

09:59.085 --> 10:02.505
Just say,
"Being locked up sucks.

10:02.630 --> 10:04.924
"But that's no
reason to hang yourself,

10:05.008 --> 10:07.677
"slit your wrists or chug
10 bottles of NyQuil."

10:08.469 --> 10:10.220
Mendez out.

10:10.596 --> 10:12.849
You think a dead prisoner
is a joke, Mendez?

10:12.932 --> 10:14.308
Something to make light of?

10:15.101 --> 10:16.185
Let me be clear.

10:16.268 --> 10:19.022
When these women are at
Litchfield, they're in our care.

10:19.147 --> 10:21.816
And yesterday, we failed.

10:21.941 --> 10:26.737
A girl died because of us.
All of us.

10:28.531 --> 10:31.993
So quit fucking around and
show some goddamn humanity.

10:32.201 --> 10:34.120
Heavy stuff, huh?

10:34.203 --> 10:35.913
Yeah. It's so hard
to believe.

10:36.706 --> 10:38.582
What are you doing tonight?

10:38.708 --> 10:41.068
Nothing. Probably gonna watch
some SportsCenter, hit the hay.

10:41.127 --> 10:43.963
You want to...
Want to get a drink?

10:44.380 --> 10:45.548
You know I would,
I have a thing...

10:45.673 --> 10:46.841
Come on.

10:46.924 --> 10:48.551
Don't be a pussy. One drink.

10:48.634 --> 10:50.887
You can watch your gay
sports show tomorrow.

10:51.595 --> 10:53.681
Yeah. All right. Cool.

10:54.557 --> 10:55.597
See you in the parking lot.

11:00.563 --> 11:04.192
Hey. I wanna order some of that ginger gum.
I got some commissary credit.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.069
There's ginger
ale at commissary.

11:06.234 --> 11:08.905
No, I tried that shit. I got
a really bad stomach thing.

11:10.238 --> 11:11.281
What's my name?

11:11.407 --> 11:13.241
What?
I said, what's my name?

11:14.535 --> 11:15.661
I don't know.

11:15.786 --> 11:18.664
Exactly. All day long it's,
"Get me this, get me that."

11:18.748 --> 11:20.750
There are,
what, 250 women in here?

11:20.875 --> 11:23.836
Is it that hard to know my name?
I bet you know Red's name.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.253
We can't help you.

11:25.421 --> 11:26.589
What?

11:33.137 --> 11:34.555
Look, I don't mean no problems.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.099
Gloria said I
should ask in here.

11:36.224 --> 11:40.477
No problem. Gina's a sensitive little
squirrel when she's on the rag.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.772
Your daughter's pregnant, yes?

11:42.939 --> 11:44.899
What? No.

11:45.608 --> 11:47.235
There's this stomach
thing going around.

11:47.359 --> 11:48.945
She hasn't eaten in weeks.

11:49.028 --> 11:52.823
She's nauseous all the time but
still has a glow on her skin.

11:53.323 --> 11:54.784
It's none of your business.

11:54.909 --> 11:57.954
You bring it into my kitchen,
you make it my business.

12:01.457 --> 12:05.128
Okay, Sherlock.
Yes. You got it.

12:05.628 --> 12:07.295
You're out
of bounds, inmate!

12:07.379 --> 12:09.423
Get the fuck out of here.

12:41.914 --> 12:43.249
Hey, what's your sign?

12:43.331 --> 12:46.794
Yo! My sign is get your ass up
and help me with this shit.

12:47.503 --> 12:50.173
You don't wanna know what the
planets have in store for you,

12:50.298 --> 12:52.091
that's your business.

12:52.216 --> 12:54.384
Man, the planets have
jail in store for me.

12:55.552 --> 12:57.833
And some more of the same
tomorrow, and the day after that.

12:57.847 --> 12:59.515
Yeah.
Aries.

12:59.682 --> 13:01.017
All right.

13:01.142 --> 13:04.061
"It might be an excellent
time to take a trip

13:04.187 --> 13:07.106
"or see a new
part of the world.

13:07.190 --> 13:09.650
"Expand your horizons,
dear Aries."

13:10.860 --> 13:15.281
Yo!
Expand your horizons, boo.

13:15.363 --> 13:16.364
Stupid.

13:17.074 --> 13:18.408
This is for the birds.

13:18.575 --> 13:21.578
Hate to break it to you, son,
but we the birds.

13:21.745 --> 13:24.456
If you want me to read yours,
all you had to do was ask.

13:24.540 --> 13:25.749
What's your sign?

13:25.875 --> 13:27.084
Taurus.

13:27.210 --> 13:31.672
Oh, yeah, you a stubborn bull,
all right. Okay.

13:33.090 --> 13:35.051
"The news that
you've been waiting for

13:35.176 --> 13:37.053
"might be
delivered in a few days,

13:37.178 --> 13:39.429
"and will likely be positive.

13:39.555 --> 13:41.265
"Gather your loved ones around,

13:41.389 --> 13:44.977
"in case you need extra support
for the changes to come."

13:45.102 --> 13:46.354
Yo, your appeal.

13:46.478 --> 13:48.147
I don't think that's
any of your business.

13:49.773 --> 13:50.858
Excuse me.

13:50.983 --> 13:53.736
So, what's up? You really
believe in all that stuff?

13:53.861 --> 13:57.031
Sure do. But this
paper's eight months old.

13:57.365 --> 13:59.533
What?
Mmm-hmm.

14:10.294 --> 14:11.295
Oh.

14:12.338 --> 14:13.923
Okay. Here's some advice,

14:14.048 --> 14:16.759
when a girl makes you cum
the way that I do,

14:16.884 --> 14:19.262
you should always act
thrilled to see her.

14:19.345 --> 14:20.429
Stop it.

14:20.554 --> 14:24.100
Okay. You're not in the mood
to banter, I withdraw my bant.

14:26.518 --> 14:27.519
Mmm.

14:27.603 --> 14:30.856
I asked some of the girls to come
help me plan a memorial for Tricia,

14:30.940 --> 14:33.276
nobody showed up.
I don't get it.

14:33.401 --> 14:36.279
I guess I'm the only one who
cares if there is a funeral.

14:36.362 --> 14:39.323
Okay. That's not the most self-involved
thing I've heard you say,

14:39.448 --> 14:41.325
but it's definitely up there.

14:41.450 --> 14:45.037
Please. Alex, will you stop
pretending like nothing happened?

14:45.246 --> 14:48.124
Pipes, you can't force people to
mourn the way you want them to

14:48.207 --> 14:49.292
just because it'll
make you feel better.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.500
That's not what I'm doing.

14:50.626 --> 14:51.961
Really?
No!

14:52.586 --> 14:55.005
'Cause I think we both know that
dealing with emotional chaos

14:55.131 --> 14:57.466
is not one of
your strong suits.

14:57.967 --> 15:01.887
Which is why we're not having an
affair, we're just being human.

15:01.971 --> 15:03.806
And why you are
planning a memorial

15:03.973 --> 15:05.808
for a girl that
you barely knew.

15:05.891 --> 15:07.393
We talked. I did know her.

15:07.601 --> 15:09.979
Did you know her better
than you knew my mom?

15:14.984 --> 15:16.026
That's not fair.

15:19.905 --> 15:21.157
None of it was fair.

15:24.534 --> 15:28.580
Look, life gets
messy sometimes.

15:30.207 --> 15:32.376
You know, you gotta learn
you can't always fix it.

15:32.460 --> 15:37.881
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.
It's off to work I go. Oh!

15:38.174 --> 15:41.635
Don't mind me, ladies. Just
gonna do a little buffering.

15:42.428 --> 15:44.138
All in a day's work.

15:48.392 --> 15:53.189
♪ Vanilla and vanilla

15:53.272 --> 15:56.442
♪ Swirl, swirl

15:56.525 --> 15:59.111
♪ Swirl, swirl ♪

15:59.320 --> 16:02.198
You know, I don't actually think it's
a swirl if it's the same flavor.

16:02.281 --> 16:03.949
You know, if you
were still my wife,

16:04.033 --> 16:07.953
I would tell you all the time
how much I like your titties.

16:08.954 --> 16:11.374
'Cause girls like that.

16:12.375 --> 16:16.586
And that is
a tip from me to you.

16:17.963 --> 16:19.589
Alex, I miss you.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.342
I don't have time
to wander around

16:21.467 --> 16:22.968
flea markets and drink
cafe au lait with you.

16:23.135 --> 16:25.721
But I'm so cute.
Look how cute I am.

16:26.305 --> 16:28.891
Babe, I'm sorry.
I'm so fucking stressed.

16:28.974 --> 16:31.727
But you're always
so fucking stressed.

16:32.686 --> 16:34.897
I feel like
a pathetic housewife.

16:38.275 --> 16:40.403
Is this our life now?

16:42.571 --> 16:44.365
Hey. Hey.

16:48.618 --> 16:53.332
Let me take you out tonight, okay?
Anywhere you want to go.

16:55.792 --> 16:56.835
Okay?

16:59.171 --> 17:00.256
Okay.

17:03.217 --> 17:04.260
Hey,

17:06.178 --> 17:08.763
would you be up for a trip
to Istanbul this weekend?

17:08.888 --> 17:10.473
Yes! Of course!

17:10.640 --> 17:13.394
Oh, babe, that's great.
Thank you.

17:13.477 --> 17:15.563
I think you should be able to
get there and back in a day,

17:15.645 --> 17:17.897
so you won't even
have to stay overnight.

17:18.022 --> 17:20.276
I'm gonna call and set
up your ticket for you.

17:20.443 --> 17:21.818
Oh, my God.

17:21.944 --> 17:24.070
I thought for a second you
meant we would go together.

17:24.154 --> 17:27.156
Like a vacation.
Like normal people.

17:27.782 --> 17:29.452
I need you to do this.

17:29.535 --> 17:31.412
I wouldn't ask if I
had any another option.

17:31.495 --> 17:35.665
I specifically told you that
I would never do that again.

17:36.041 --> 17:39.169
Jesus, I am so stupid.

17:39.462 --> 17:41.964
I really am. I'm just
another drug mule to you.

17:42.131 --> 17:44.300
You are such
a naive asshole sometimes.

17:44.383 --> 17:45.426
I'm an asshole?

17:45.509 --> 17:48.304
I'm drowning right now and you
won't even consider helping me.

17:48.471 --> 17:51.474
I am done. I can't do this anymore.
I can't be with you.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.309
Are you serious?
Where are you gonna go?

17:53.434 --> 17:55.018
I don't know
where I'm gonna go.

17:55.144 --> 17:56.103
I'm gonna go
back to the States,

17:56.186 --> 17:57.146
where I'm not your errand girl.

17:57.271 --> 17:59.482
I can't believe I didn't see this coming.
How did I not see this...

17:59.607 --> 18:01.448
You know what, I did see this coming.
Years ago.

18:01.484 --> 18:04.236
Rule number one. Don't ever fall
in love with a straight girl.

18:04.361 --> 18:07.739
Is that what you think this is about?
That I like dick?

18:07.823 --> 18:09.543
You know, I guess that
is easier than facing

18:09.617 --> 18:11.285
the fact that you
are a drug dealer.

18:11.743 --> 18:14.997
And it is ruining
everything good in your life.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.375
Don't you dare push this on me.

18:20.169 --> 18:22.379
You knew exactly
what you were getting into.

18:24.673 --> 18:26.675
I thought we were a team.

18:37.060 --> 18:40.439
This shit is weird. Why
aren't we playing dominoes?

18:41.940 --> 18:44.026
And what's she doing here?

18:47.321 --> 18:48.864
You gotta fuck Pornstache.

18:48.989 --> 18:52.701
What the fuck? What are
you even talking about?

18:55.371 --> 18:59.875
If you want to keep your baby and
Bennett, this is the only way.

18:59.958 --> 19:02.378
Otherwise, you don't get both.

19:03.253 --> 19:04.713
You just gotta
get him to fuck you.

19:04.796 --> 19:08.133
Then you go to Caputo, and tell
him that Pornstache raped you,

19:08.217 --> 19:09.926
you got the proof.

19:10.052 --> 19:11.720
The proof is in the pudding,
as they say.

19:12.179 --> 19:14.473
You let soldier boy
dream about his furlough.

19:14.557 --> 19:16.559
It ain't gonna happen.

19:16.642 --> 19:18.852
Girls in here miss
their own mother's funeral.

19:18.935 --> 19:21.055
And I think we all know
your mother's doing just fine.

19:21.104 --> 19:23.148
I don't care.

19:23.232 --> 19:26.443
I won't cheat on John.
I love him.

19:26.652 --> 19:27.861
Of course,

19:27.944 --> 19:30.406
which is exactly why
this is your only option.

19:31.490 --> 19:33.659
We've all known
girls in your situation,

19:33.783 --> 19:35.911
and do you know
what happens to them?

19:36.036 --> 19:39.748
They get punished.
Sent out to the SHU.

19:39.831 --> 19:42.459
Transferred to
maximum security.

19:42.585 --> 19:44.836
And when it comes out that
Bennett is the father,

19:44.920 --> 19:47.047
he'll be arrested
and convicted as

19:47.172 --> 19:49.299
a sex offender and
he'll go to prison, too.

19:50.426 --> 19:52.428
This is bigger than you.

19:53.011 --> 19:56.139
Every decision you make now
affects your family.

19:56.848 --> 19:58.559
Welcome to motherhood.

20:02.605 --> 20:07.568
Even if I say yes, and I'm not,
how would I get him to do it?

20:08.652 --> 20:11.697
You're good at getting guys
to sleep with you, no?

20:16.159 --> 20:18.870
No. Toss those.

20:19.037 --> 20:22.999
Here, I'll take that.
Used it on her corn rows.

20:23.166 --> 20:26.795
You called her "corn hoes"
when she and Mercy started dating.

20:26.962 --> 20:29.757
Yes, well,
that was before she was dead.

20:29.839 --> 20:31.879
Besides, I told Mercy
I'd keep a few things for her.

20:31.925 --> 20:33.176
You talked to Mercy?

20:33.385 --> 20:35.638
Yeah. I mean,
somebody had to talk to her.

20:35.721 --> 20:37.013
That was good of you, Boo.

20:37.139 --> 20:38.140
Yeah.

20:38.265 --> 20:41.101
Remember when Danita tried
to do Trish's corn rows?

20:42.603 --> 20:44.480
Even Black Cindy couldn't
fix that shit. Yeah.

20:44.647 --> 20:47.023
Poor kid. She walked
around looking like

20:47.149 --> 20:49.568
Ursula from
The Little Mermaid for weeks.

20:55.741 --> 20:56.992
You eat.

20:57.701 --> 20:58.868
Thank you.

20:59.578 --> 21:00.663
Fucking Chang.

21:00.829 --> 21:01.950
Who would've thought it, huh?

21:02.080 --> 21:03.332
Yeah.

21:03.915 --> 21:08.253
Hey!
Fresh out of the microwave.

21:09.630 --> 21:10.714
Gracias.

21:10.839 --> 21:11.923
Always thought
Tricia seemed nice.

21:12.007 --> 21:14.092
I mean,
I never talked to her much

21:14.217 --> 21:16.345
or nothing,
but she had a good vibe.

21:16.553 --> 21:17.554
Yeah.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.682
Sucks she hung herself.

21:21.141 --> 21:22.643
I'm really sorry for your loss.

21:22.726 --> 21:24.603
Yeah. Gracias.

21:25.854 --> 21:26.896
Let me smell.

21:27.022 --> 21:28.148
What do you think?

21:28.357 --> 21:29.858
What's up?

21:29.941 --> 21:32.528
Thought y'all could use some
comfort food.

21:33.821 --> 21:35.113
Oh, shit!

21:37.366 --> 21:39.368
You know, I talked to her once
in the food line.

21:40.577 --> 21:41.870
Man, we both hated goulash day.

21:42.912 --> 21:45.415
She pulled off them
rows really nice, too.

21:45.582 --> 21:47.543
Yeah. Well, for a white girl.

21:47.626 --> 21:48.836
Thanks for all of this.

21:49.044 --> 21:50.379
Oh, also...

21:54.132 --> 21:55.133
This.

21:56.343 --> 21:57.803
Holy shit.

21:57.886 --> 21:59.722
Looks like they forgot to turn
these potatoes into chips.

21:59.847 --> 22:01.557
Open that up, shawty.

22:01.724 --> 22:03.475
Shit!
You gotta check this out.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.144
What? Let me see.
What? No fucking way.

22:07.354 --> 22:09.147
Fucking check it out!

22:09.981 --> 22:12.651
You gotta pour one
out for her, right?

22:15.445 --> 22:16.530
Thanks, son.

22:16.655 --> 22:17.740
Yeah.

22:20.242 --> 22:21.660
Looks like we throwing a party.

22:21.744 --> 22:22.994
Fucking-A.

22:23.495 --> 22:26.749
We were having our coffee,
reading the paper.

22:26.914 --> 22:33.255
And all of a sudden there are two huge
guys with badges at our front door.

22:33.589 --> 22:35.090
Piper wasn't even dressed.

22:35.173 --> 22:36.966
You never expect to
be in your pajamas

22:37.092 --> 22:38.926
the moment your
life changes forever.

22:39.052 --> 22:40.470
That's true, isn't it?

22:40.596 --> 22:43.181
At the very least you'd have
underwear on, hopefully.

22:43.265 --> 22:47.102
And how did you feel
once you started to understand

22:47.185 --> 22:49.438
that she'd actually
committed the crime?

22:49.563 --> 22:51.815
That your fiancee was
an indicted criminal?

22:51.939 --> 22:55.110
I was blindsided,
that's for sure.

22:55.444 --> 23:00.198
But it's like anything, eventually
it starts to feel normal.

23:01.867 --> 23:06.455
You figure out the right words to
say to other people. You adjust.

23:07.955 --> 23:11.167
I have to assume that
Piper is much more fortunate

23:11.293 --> 23:13.044
than a lot of
the women in there with her.

23:13.169 --> 23:17.633
You're able to drive up to see
her, you have resources, family.

23:17.841 --> 23:22.471
Yeah. Yeah. We're very lucky.
I see her a lot.

23:22.638 --> 23:23.806
What are your visits like?

23:23.931 --> 23:28.976
Oh, you know. She catches me up
on all the latest prison gossip.

23:29.102 --> 23:30.854
Which is actually
highly entertaining.

23:30.978 --> 23:32.021
Really?
Yeah.

23:32.147 --> 23:35.191
Can you tell us some
of your favorite stories?

23:35.983 --> 23:39.446
Oh, man. Well, I think my
favorite is one of the first.

23:49.331 --> 23:50.332
Ow!

23:50.540 --> 23:52.334
Dandelion! You okay?

23:52.835 --> 23:56.003
No touching.
No touching, okay? I'm fine.

23:56.505 --> 23:58.340
I'm real sorry about that.

23:58.465 --> 24:02.803
There used to be a sign that
said, "Caution. Wet floor."

24:02.886 --> 24:04.805
Really told people
what was going on.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.561
Suzanne, do you think
you could help me up?

24:12.187 --> 24:13.480
It's okay.

24:13.563 --> 24:15.524
Okay. Man. Okay.

24:16.817 --> 24:18.902
Here we go. Okay.

24:19.026 --> 24:20.737
Okay. Okay.

24:20.863 --> 24:23.907
This is my fault.
This is my fault.

24:24.449 --> 24:26.535
My fault. My fault.

24:26.660 --> 24:27.981
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Please, don't,

24:28.035 --> 24:29.329
please, please,
please, don't do that.

24:29.412 --> 24:31.456
Please... It's okay.

24:32.749 --> 24:33.792
Thanks.

24:33.917 --> 24:36.545
I'm gonna make sure
you get home okay.

24:37.546 --> 24:39.046
No weird stuff.

24:39.882 --> 24:41.216
Thanks.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.348
You know this doesn't mean
I'm your wife, right?

24:50.225 --> 24:54.396
I'm in much more of a
loving-being-single phase, anyway.

24:54.479 --> 24:57.858
I don't wanna be tied down.
You feel me?

24:58.775 --> 25:00.109
Oh, I feel you.

25:07.367 --> 25:10.954
Thank you, Suzanne.
Thank you very much.

25:15.291 --> 25:16.292
Ah!

25:17.293 --> 25:19.337
Suzanne, would you
mind taking this pillow

25:19.462 --> 25:21.506
and putting it
underneath my knee?

25:23.759 --> 25:25.427
You're not gonna pee, are you?

25:25.594 --> 25:30.265
No. When I get angry sometimes
I can't control myself.

25:30.348 --> 25:35.311
That's why I go to Looney Jail sometimes.
Psych. But not like "psych!"

25:36.312 --> 25:38.440
I gotta work on self-control.

25:38.565 --> 25:40.400
I can come back up
here when I'm in control

25:40.483 --> 25:42.444
'cause Mommy and
Daddy and the lawyer

25:42.611 --> 25:44.571
have an agreement
with the warden.

25:44.696 --> 25:48.408
Yeah. I like it up here.
I just gotta use the signal.

25:48.784 --> 25:50.077
What's the signal?

25:52.495 --> 25:56.499
Yeah. Helps the guards
know it's cool.

25:56.625 --> 25:58.919
Otherwise, back down.

25:59.044 --> 26:00.754
Is Psych worse than the SHU?

26:01.128 --> 26:02.464
Way worse.

26:02.631 --> 26:03.715
Scary.

26:04.674 --> 26:07.719
It's bold. Cold. Old.

26:08.428 --> 26:12.599
It's real bad. I wouldn't
wish it on the worst gremlin.

26:13.391 --> 26:14.631
But they give
you a therapist...

26:14.684 --> 26:15.852
No.

26:15.978 --> 26:20.816
Nope. I mean, they give me
medication and make me calm.

26:20.899 --> 26:23.192
But that just makes me sleepy.

26:23.359 --> 26:26.279
Sometimes when I'm real upset,
they tie me down.

26:26.446 --> 26:28.824
Like a balloon.
So I don't fly away.

26:29.156 --> 26:30.617
That sounds horrible.

26:30.826 --> 26:33.286
Yeah. Nobody comes
back from Psych.

26:34.245 --> 26:35.580
Except me.

26:36.539 --> 26:41.003
Once you go to Psych,
you get lost in Psych.

26:41.461 --> 26:45.507
It's like that place with the three corners?
In the ocean?

26:45.674 --> 26:47.092
The Bermuda Triangle.

26:47.216 --> 26:50.095
We should play charades
sometime, Dandelion.

26:50.177 --> 26:55.308
We'd make great partners.
Not wives. Just partners.

26:58.478 --> 27:01.023
Oh, can I ask you
one more question?

27:01.648 --> 27:02.899
Yeah, of course.

27:04.151 --> 27:08.446
How come everyone
calls me Crazy Eyes?

27:38.810 --> 27:41.228
Oh! God, no!

27:47.903 --> 27:50.864
Another five milligrams
of diazepam for Doggett.

27:50.947 --> 27:53.408
I don't need any more.
I don't need no...

27:53.575 --> 27:54.826
Hey!

27:57.579 --> 27:59.081
I'm not crazy.

27:59.372 --> 28:01.958
Jesus, where are
you when I need you?

28:04.794 --> 28:08.006
No! Please.
I'm not crazy, I swear.

28:08.173 --> 28:10.926
If you weren't crazy, you
wouldn't have to work so hard

28:11.051 --> 28:12.594
to convince
everyone you're sane.

28:21.561 --> 28:24.439
To Tricia.
May she rest in peace.

28:33.448 --> 28:34.490
Hey, Boo!
Hey!

28:34.616 --> 28:35.575
Oh, fuck off!

28:35.658 --> 28:38.120
Got to pour one out
for our girl, huh?

28:38.327 --> 28:39.370
Shit.

28:40.163 --> 28:41.289
Take it, take it.

28:41.456 --> 28:44.167
I thought you said they
weren't doing rounds today.

28:44.626 --> 28:45.919
Oh, it's just you.

28:46.002 --> 28:47.045
Yeah.

28:49.297 --> 28:50.465
Girl, get your ass in here.

28:55.262 --> 28:57.222
So this is what you
guys decided to do

28:57.346 --> 28:59.307
instead of come
to my memorial? Huh?

28:59.390 --> 29:00.600
Get drunk?

29:00.683 --> 29:02.269
Which looks like more fun?

29:02.393 --> 29:03.937
Point, Nun.

29:05.147 --> 29:06.314
No, I can't.

29:06.439 --> 29:08.316
Hey, hand it over.

29:15.323 --> 29:17.117
Used to be a lady
in here who made

29:17.242 --> 29:19.035
the best toilet
hooch you've ever had.

29:19.661 --> 29:20.996
Shame she got out.

29:23.206 --> 29:24.207
Mmm!

29:25.583 --> 29:27.585
Why is having a drink
so cathartic sometimes?

29:27.669 --> 29:30.338
Booze helps you process.
At least where I come from.

29:30.421 --> 29:32.381
My family just yelled at
each other when they drank

29:32.423 --> 29:34.176
and then pretended
like nothing happened.

29:34.425 --> 29:35.426
Ah.

29:35.510 --> 29:38.346
This explains the wide-eyed,
ice-princess uptight thing.

29:38.471 --> 29:40.015
I'm not uptight!

29:41.891 --> 29:44.393
Really? Is that funny?
It's really that hilarious?

29:44.519 --> 29:45.687
No, it's fine.

29:58.992 --> 30:00.535
You're awfully quiet, Nichols.

30:01.286 --> 30:03.038
It's been a long day, you know?

30:03.538 --> 30:05.040
Look at this shit.

30:05.165 --> 30:07.542
Still kept track of everything
she owed everybody.

30:10.170 --> 30:13.006
How's that for karma,
huh? Yoga?

30:13.089 --> 30:14.883
That girl, she was good.

30:15.383 --> 30:18.887
Better than any of us. Too fucking
good for this fucking place.

30:19.095 --> 30:21.806
Well, fuck that. We all are.

30:24.142 --> 30:25.310
To Trish.

30:25.434 --> 30:26.686
To Trish.

30:28.479 --> 30:32.150
Hey, come on, Benny.
Shoot one back with me, bud?

30:32.317 --> 30:33.597
Nah, it's all right.
I'm driving.

30:33.651 --> 30:35.362
Suit yourself.

30:52.754 --> 30:54.214
Hello, ladies.

30:54.839 --> 30:56.216
How are we doing this evening?

30:56.424 --> 30:57.800
Buy us a drink?

30:58.009 --> 30:59.386
Are you serious?

30:59.468 --> 31:02.513
That's the first thing you say
to me, buy us a fucking drink?

31:02.597 --> 31:05.433
You believe these
fucking sluts, Bennett?

31:05.558 --> 31:07.102
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

31:07.185 --> 31:08.603
I'm sorry.
We just had a long week,

31:08.770 --> 31:10.146
we're letting off
some steam here.

31:10.272 --> 31:11.356
He didn't mean it.

31:11.439 --> 31:13.400
Yeah,
'cause we work at the prison.

31:13.524 --> 31:15.693
No shit?
That's gotta be scary.

31:16.527 --> 31:20.115
A girl died yesterday.
Hung herself.

31:20.198 --> 31:24.619
Should've seen how her eyes fucking bulged
out of her head.

31:25.078 --> 31:27.663
Like that actor, that...

31:27.789 --> 31:30.541
Oh, come on,  the
one with the big eyes...

31:30.625 --> 31:34.296
Oh, come on! You know, the fucking...
The ugly one.

31:35.630 --> 31:38.466
All right. I think, maybe we
should get you home, man.

31:40.009 --> 31:41.010
Oh.

31:41.970 --> 31:44.555
You know what pisses me off, Benny?

31:44.931 --> 31:47.016
These fucking
bitches look at me like I'm

31:47.142 --> 31:49.227
some goddamn piece
of meat, you know?

31:49.311 --> 31:51.313
Like a fucking sex toy.

31:51.438 --> 31:53.481
But I'm a human being, man.

31:53.606 --> 31:57.193
I'm a person, you know,
with feelings and emotions.

31:58.445 --> 32:01.323
Does anybody ever ask me
how my day is going?

32:02.490 --> 32:03.825
No.

32:04.659 --> 32:08.997
We practically live with these girls.
We know everything about them.

32:09.998 --> 32:14.043
Do they ever for a second think
about our life outside of work?

32:14.919 --> 32:17.964
It's like we cease to exist
outside of those fucking walls.

32:18.047 --> 32:19.924
What the fuck is that?

32:21.426 --> 32:26.014
I'm sitting here, right?
Yeah, I exist!

32:32.354 --> 32:36.107
They think I'm so tall,
my feelings don't get hurt.

32:37.942 --> 32:39.152
All right, yeah.

32:40.653 --> 32:44.532
You are tall, buddy.
Come on. I'll drive you home.

32:44.699 --> 32:46.201
All right.

32:46.868 --> 32:48.870
All right, all right.

33:01.174 --> 33:03.218
Still a lightweight, huh, kid?

33:03.385 --> 33:07.347
Hooch is a little stronger
than Pinot Grigio, you know?

33:09.849 --> 33:11.934
You're looking very nice today.

33:12.101 --> 33:13.728
Better than you, at least.

33:13.853 --> 33:15.730
Are you off to
see you-know-who?

33:15.938 --> 33:17.106
Perhaps.

33:17.273 --> 33:20.568
Well, don't forget Larry's
interview is at 11:00 a.m.

33:20.776 --> 33:22.529
I wouldn't miss it.

33:23.863 --> 33:26.491
Well, you two are like
real butt buddies these days.

33:26.699 --> 33:29.660
What do you think about that thing
that Big Boo said last night?

33:29.785 --> 33:31.579
About Tricia's karma?

33:31.787 --> 33:34.290
I think that we were all drunk
and bullshitting.

33:34.499 --> 33:36.543
What if it's not bullshit?

33:37.877 --> 33:40.338
I don't think that Pennsatucky
deserves to be in Psych.

33:40.588 --> 33:44.259
Look, you're just hung over
and feeling emo, all right?

33:44.342 --> 33:46.886
She's exactly
where she belongs.

33:46.969 --> 33:48.596
We basically
performed a public service.

33:48.721 --> 33:50.306
It's pretty horrible, Alex.

33:50.598 --> 33:51.766
You thought it was hilarious.

33:51.891 --> 33:54.519
That was before I talked to Suzanne
about what psych was like.

33:54.602 --> 33:55.603
Who's Suzanne?

33:55.686 --> 33:56.687
Crazy Eyes.

33:56.771 --> 33:58.731
Are you cheating on me and
Larry with Crazy Eyes?

33:58.814 --> 34:00.534
'Cause there is not
room for the four of us.

34:00.608 --> 34:02.360
Shut up. This is not funny.

34:02.444 --> 34:06.072
She said that Psych
is even worse than the SHU.

34:06.155 --> 34:08.616
And I can't even begin...
I can't.

34:08.699 --> 34:10.060
You know,
you really shouldn't have

34:10.118 --> 34:11.558
started this whole
gaslighting thing.

34:11.578 --> 34:12.620
Whoa, what is with the blaming?

34:12.703 --> 34:14.539
You sent her
into that bathroom.

34:14.621 --> 34:16.831
Do not project your
conscience onto me.

34:16.958 --> 34:19.210
Especially before
I'm barely awake.

34:19.335 --> 34:22.838
You know, you're absolutely right.
You're absolutely right.

34:22.964 --> 34:24.299
I am gonna go to
Caputo's office

34:24.424 --> 34:25.757
and I'm gonna tell
him that it was my fault

34:25.841 --> 34:27.135
and that he should let her out.

34:27.260 --> 34:29.554
Okay, I get your point,
Pipes. I get it.

34:29.678 --> 34:32.014
You think that
it was wrong. Cool.

34:32.848 --> 34:36.143
I am so tired of running away
from my shit, Alex.

34:36.268 --> 34:38.438
You said it yesterday.
I compartmentalize

34:38.563 --> 34:40.731
everything to make
myself feel better.

34:41.315 --> 34:43.568
I mean, I'm having
an affair with you.

34:43.650 --> 34:46.821
And we did not play a prank
on Pennsatucky, we were mean.

34:46.904 --> 34:49.991
I cannot let her
stay in Psych. I can't.

34:50.116 --> 34:52.201
Okay,
I would like to stress that

34:52.327 --> 34:54.496
I think this is
truly fucking stupid.

34:54.829 --> 34:57.540
It was me that
started this whole thing.

34:57.665 --> 35:00.627
Then I'll take this
one for the both of us.

35:06.174 --> 35:08.510
Are you off
the phone now?

35:09.135 --> 35:11.804
It wasn't in the bathroom,
either.

35:11.887 --> 35:14.641
Did you look at
all while I was out?

35:16.684 --> 35:18.769
Alex,
I understand you're upset,

35:18.853 --> 35:22.773
but could you at least acknowledge
I'm a person who is speaking?

35:23.899 --> 35:27.028
If I miss this
flight I'm screwed.

35:29.905 --> 35:33.951
Alex! Passport! Hello?

35:36.120 --> 35:37.539
My mom died.

35:42.502 --> 35:43.628
What?

35:47.173 --> 35:51.135
My aunt just called up. It
happened this morning, I guess.

35:53.012 --> 35:54.597
Oh, Alex.

35:56.265 --> 35:57.892
I'm so sorry.

35:59.101 --> 36:02.605
My first instinct was
to call her to talk about it.

36:07.694 --> 36:09.320
What happened?

36:09.737 --> 36:11.864
An aneurysm.

36:13.241 --> 36:17.078
I don't know. My aunt said so many
things I don't even remember now.

36:17.203 --> 36:18.746
What can I do?

36:19.372 --> 36:21.082
I don't know.
I mean, I need to fly home.

36:21.165 --> 36:22.750
I need to figure
out the funeral

36:22.875 --> 36:24.419
because there's no
one else to do it.

36:24.669 --> 36:25.753
Okay.

36:27.422 --> 36:31.509
Will you see if you could find us
two seats out on a flight today?

36:37.390 --> 36:39.267
Al, I can't go with you.

36:43.145 --> 36:44.313
What?

36:45.773 --> 36:48.651
I am so sorry about your mom.

36:51.946 --> 36:53.781
But this doesn't
change anything.

36:54.532 --> 36:56.409
You're still leaving?

36:57.410 --> 36:58.786
Right now?

37:00.788 --> 37:05.126
My mother just died.
I can't fucking believe you.

37:07.295 --> 37:09.464
I can't be your
girlfriend anymore.

37:09.547 --> 37:12.300
Yeah, and apparently
not even my friend.

37:15.428 --> 37:17.388
Top drawer,
underneath my T-shirts.

37:17.555 --> 37:18.847
Jesus, Alex!

37:21.267 --> 37:23.185
You fucking hid it?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.152
Please don't leave.

37:32.487 --> 37:33.738
Not now.

37:44.039 --> 37:45.958
You shouldn't
really be out here.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.336
It's okay.
I wanted to see you.

37:49.003 --> 37:50.254
How are you feeling?

37:52.006 --> 37:55.343
Okay. A little better. You
heard anything from the warden?

37:55.426 --> 37:57.762
No. I'm...

37:57.845 --> 37:59.221
To be honest,
I think I might have

37:59.347 --> 38:00.723
underestimated
how long it'll take.

38:00.848 --> 38:03.184
They said it could be weeks,
or maybe even months.

38:03.351 --> 38:05.144
We don't got much time.
I know.

38:05.227 --> 38:07.772
Daya, look, I'm really starting
to freak out a little.

38:07.855 --> 38:09.482
I mean, I'm trying to be cool.

38:09.565 --> 38:11.108
But, you know,
I could be arrested for this.

38:11.192 --> 38:12.985
It's not just my job.
It's my whole life, you know?

38:13.068 --> 38:14.987
And I know it's yours,
too, of course.

38:15.112 --> 38:17.031
I don't know how
we're gonna fix this...

38:20.535 --> 38:23.329
It'll be okay.
I know it will.

38:24.079 --> 38:26.499
We'll figure
something out, okay?

38:27.208 --> 38:28.501
Okay.

38:30.837 --> 38:33.047
You know,
would you have liked me

38:33.214 --> 38:35.466
if we would have met
out in the real world?

38:35.633 --> 38:36.884
Yeah.

38:37.510 --> 38:39.261
For real?
Of course.

38:40.262 --> 38:43.932
I would've bought you a drink.
Chatted you up.

38:44.392 --> 38:46.894
I don't know if we would
have been in the same club.

38:47.061 --> 38:48.771
Who knows?
You know, I ended up

38:48.896 --> 38:50.616
in a skeezy dive bar
with Mendez last night.

38:50.732 --> 38:54.902
Never thought I'd be in a place like that.
Oh, man, he was so drunk.

38:55.027 --> 38:56.070
Really?

38:56.237 --> 38:58.197
Wasted, Daya.
Oh, it was hilarious.

38:58.280 --> 38:59.741
These two nasty girls
started hitting on him,

38:59.907 --> 39:01.325
then he went on this whole rant

39:01.409 --> 39:02.910
about how women
treat him like meat

39:03.035 --> 39:04.704
and never ask him
how he's doing or anything.

39:04.787 --> 39:07.498
Who knew he was
such a delicate flower?

39:08.249 --> 39:10.209
I wish you could've seen it.

39:11.168 --> 39:12.712
Me, too.

39:34.442 --> 39:35.860
Mr. Caputo?

39:36.444 --> 39:38.446
What do you need, Chapman?

39:39.363 --> 39:41.574
I'd like to talk to you
about Tiffany Doggett.

39:42.742 --> 39:45.828
We took care of her. She
won't be a problem anymore.

39:46.328 --> 39:48.831
It wasn't her fault.
It was mine.

39:48.956 --> 39:52.460
And I would like to fill out a report.
Officially.

39:56.672 --> 39:57.715
Have a seat.

40:13.355 --> 40:15.316
What the fuck are you doing?

40:15.399 --> 40:18.986
You are out of bounds. Get back
behind the line immediately, inmate.

40:19.111 --> 40:24.116
Sorry, I was just... I wanted to talk.
Is that okay?

40:24.992 --> 40:27.077
You must get bored in here.

40:29.079 --> 40:31.123
It's not stimulating, no.

40:31.206 --> 40:33.542
You like other posts
more than the bubble?

40:34.502 --> 40:36.671
Cafeteria's my favorite.

40:36.838 --> 40:38.840
More to do, keeps you busy.

40:38.965 --> 40:40.675
Fucking hate that intake.

40:40.758 --> 40:44.846
The goddamn ID machine's
always broken. Why?

40:45.721 --> 40:48.307
No reason.
Just curious about your day.

40:50.768 --> 40:53.145
Well, it's
important to stay occupied.

40:53.270 --> 40:55.648
That's why I work on
these brain exercises.

40:55.731 --> 40:57.859
You know, a job like this,
you gotta stay sharp.

40:57.942 --> 40:59.902
You gotta stay on
top of your game.

41:00.027 --> 41:03.197
You gotta stay a step ahead.
Quick like a snake.

41:06.325 --> 41:09.662
In case any crossword
criminals jump out at you?

41:13.248 --> 41:18.587
You know, the other day I just
read this article about Sudoku.

41:19.254 --> 41:22.591
Turns out, the Japanese
did not invent it.

41:22.717 --> 41:26.136
Some American,
some guy came up with it,

41:26.261 --> 41:29.724
originally called
it Numbers Place.

41:30.516 --> 41:33.101
Now I don't know what
Sudoku means in Japanese,

41:33.227 --> 41:37.105
but I find it a little bit odd that
it came out right before 9/11.

41:49.535 --> 41:50.745
You are glowing.

41:50.995 --> 41:52.204
Am I?

41:57.251 --> 42:03.591
Jean, I don't want to jinx it, but I
think I'll hear about my appeal soon.

42:05.342 --> 42:07.344
Where would you like to go?

42:07.511 --> 42:09.263
What do you mean?

42:09.388 --> 42:12.600
On your first night out.
Where should we go?

42:12.725 --> 42:14.769
Anywhere you like.

42:15.603 --> 42:20.441
You must believe, lanmou mwen.
Believe and it will happen.

42:23.027 --> 42:26.030
You remember that
little Italian place down

42:26.154 --> 42:29.116
in the basement,
on Montague Street?

42:29.241 --> 42:30.785
The one with the fresh bread.

42:30.910 --> 42:32.327
Of course I do.

42:32.536 --> 42:34.371
I'd like to go there.

42:34.705 --> 42:36.164
And after?

42:36.749 --> 42:39.293
Anywhere, with you.

42:44.799 --> 42:46.216
Attention all officers,

42:46.341 --> 42:47.760
intake for new
prisoners will be in one hour.

42:47.843 --> 42:50.888
Come in. She's family.

42:56.102 --> 42:58.104
I'll do it.
I got it all set up.

42:58.228 --> 43:01.148
You're sure? Did you tell
him you wanted drugs?

43:01.315 --> 43:03.776
No, I just talked to him.

43:04.068 --> 43:06.487
Simple.
It's clean. I like it.

43:07.154 --> 43:11.241
I didn't want to be this graphic
in front of your mother.

43:12.284 --> 43:13.869
But you know he needs to...

43:15.079 --> 43:16.330
Cum inside of you.

43:16.497 --> 43:17.832
Or on you.

43:18.206 --> 43:21.585
Right. Okay, if... At the very least,
you got to Lewinsky this shit.

43:21.669 --> 43:23.378
Get some splooge
on your uniform.

43:23.504 --> 43:25.255
Anything that'll
be concrete proof.

43:27.174 --> 43:30.011
After you're done, you go
straight to the medic's office.

43:30.094 --> 43:33.597
Tell him you've been raped. Have
him do an exam immediately.

43:33.681 --> 43:35.141
Don't stop to pee.

43:35.223 --> 43:37.893
Don't wash anything.
Understand?

43:40.938 --> 43:42.397
Go get 'em, tiger.

43:55.369 --> 43:57.538
Well, you're not in the SHU.
Mmm-mmm.

43:57.621 --> 44:01.375
Janitorial duty.
Night shift. Two weeks.

44:02.043 --> 44:03.335
You're lucky.

44:03.878 --> 44:05.963
You better be
careful for a while.

44:09.175 --> 44:10.551
No, no, no, no, no.

44:10.634 --> 44:12.553
I think that looks like the exact
opposite of being careful.

44:12.678 --> 44:14.096
Regnery is on duty again.

44:15.056 --> 44:16.891
Come be my little spoon.

44:24.023 --> 44:25.440
Gosh!

44:27.484 --> 44:29.820
Ow. How do you
sleep on this thing?

44:30.362 --> 44:31.655
Not well.

44:35.951 --> 44:37.619
Hey, I am proud of you.

44:39.663 --> 44:41.248
Yeah?
Yeah.

44:44.585 --> 44:49.924
That was really brave. I mean,
it was dumb, but brave.

44:53.761 --> 44:54.929
You know,

44:56.138 --> 45:01.060
I don't think that anyone has ever
used that word to describe me

45:01.143 --> 45:02.937
in the history of the universe.

45:06.272 --> 45:08.859
I'm glad we have
each other in here, kid.

45:09.235 --> 45:10.527
Yeah, me, too.

45:11.570 --> 45:16.909
I mean, I'd rather be on a beach in
Tahiti, but this is a close second.

45:20.662 --> 45:24.125
Why do you always
feel so inevitable to me?

45:27.086 --> 45:28.462
I heart you.

45:28.587 --> 45:29.755
You heart me?

45:29.880 --> 45:31.048
Yeah.

45:31.215 --> 45:34.300
What is that? Is that like
"I love you" for pussies?

45:34.468 --> 45:36.095
Say "pussy" again.

46:00.995 --> 46:02.663
I heart you, too.

46:03.329 --> 46:06.625
Hey, not-lesbians.
It's 11:00.

46:06.750 --> 46:08.502
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

46:08.627 --> 46:10.171
Do you have a radio?
Yeah.

46:12.714 --> 46:14.842
Are you gonna be okay to
listen to this thing together?

46:15.009 --> 46:17.511
I mean, I don't think
it's against the rules.

46:19.013 --> 46:20.848
Okay.
Okay. Here.

46:24.476 --> 46:26.436
Chances are,
most of you have been there.

46:26.520 --> 46:29.355
It starts with
two people in love.

46:29.439 --> 46:32.734
You make a lot of promises, tell each
other you're different from the rest,

46:32.860 --> 46:34.153
the exception.

46:35.612 --> 46:37.739
For a month or two,
the long, meandering

46:37.865 --> 46:40.034
conversations feel
foreign and exciting.

46:40.117 --> 46:42.870
A chance to get to know one
another in a more intimate level.

46:43.871 --> 46:48.167
And then, slowly, so slowly
you might not even notice,

46:48.250 --> 46:53.297
conversations are replaced by missed
calls and resentful voicemails.

46:53.839 --> 46:55.090
And then finally,

46:55.841 --> 46:57.676
the day comes when
the two of you admit

46:57.801 --> 46:59.678
that you aren't,
in fact, the exception.

47:02.681 --> 47:05.475
That being far away from
the person you love most

47:05.642 --> 47:10.272
is difficult on the good days
and impossible on the bad ones.

47:14.568 --> 47:17.738
Today, we're exploring
long-distance relationships

47:18.655 --> 47:20.241
and talking with
a few New Yorkers

47:20.324 --> 47:23.451
who are currently navigating
these treacherous waters.

47:24.245 --> 47:27.455
I'm Maury Kind,
encouraging you to take

47:27.581 --> 47:30.792
a break from life
and join us, won't you?

47:32.253 --> 47:34.755
Can you tell us some
of your favorite stories?

47:34.838 --> 47:35.881
Oh, man.

47:37.049 --> 47:40.969
Well, I think my
favorite is one of the first.

47:42.304 --> 47:46.392
This insane girl,
like, actually insane,

47:46.474 --> 47:50.396
the kind of person who belongs in a
psychiatric hospital not a prison,

47:50.520 --> 47:52.356
but that's a whole
other discussion.

47:52.438 --> 47:56.484
She decides that Piper
is going to be her wife.

47:57.443 --> 48:02.032
She followed her around for days.
Wrote her this horrible poem.

48:02.866 --> 48:06.578
Do things like that concern
you in terms of Piper's safety?

48:06.787 --> 48:10.498
Of course.
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

48:11.499 --> 48:13.419
I know she can handle herself,

48:14.086 --> 48:15.879
but when you're dealing
with unstable women,

48:15.963 --> 48:18.464
you have no idea what they're
actually capable of.

48:18.632 --> 48:24.138
I mean, when your fiancee says
that she sleeps with one eye open

48:24.221 --> 48:26.723
because her
roommate is rumored to be

48:26.848 --> 48:29.310
a murderer and might
shiv her in her sleep,

48:29.435 --> 48:31.645
it's impossible
not to be scared.

48:31.728 --> 48:35.649
And I don't want to imply that
they're all crazy and dangerous.

48:36.984 --> 48:40.695
There's one girl who
should've been a track star.

48:40.821 --> 48:45.159
She was actually gonna start training
again while she was in there,

48:45.242 --> 48:49.121
but they shut the track down
because of budget cuts.

48:49.204 --> 48:52.124
There's the girl who has been
planning her wedding for months,

48:52.207 --> 48:54.084
just like everything is normal.

48:54.168 --> 48:57.838
Oh, but she is also sleeping
with the hot, lesbian junkie.

48:57.963 --> 49:00.090
How's that for a prison cliche?

49:00.924 --> 49:04.428
I mean, the cast of
characters goes on and on.

49:04.510 --> 49:09.433
There is the Russian woman who runs
the kitchen, totally terrifying,

49:09.515 --> 49:14.313
but she takes so much pride
in feeding everyone.

49:14.771 --> 49:17.523
You really have
to admire the way

49:17.649 --> 49:20.402
these women find
meaning in their days.

49:20.735 --> 49:23.364
How they take
care of each other.

49:26.532 --> 49:29.203
I'd like to
talk about the idea

49:29.328 --> 49:31.955
of female prison tropes,
if we could.

49:33.165 --> 49:36.210
It certainly seems
that sexual abuse

49:36.335 --> 49:39.380
and rape are very real threats.

49:40.047 --> 49:43.800
And then, of course,
there's the consensual sex.

49:43.884 --> 49:47.179
Did you and Piper make any
agreements before she left?

49:47.846 --> 49:48.847
Agreements?

49:48.930 --> 49:53.519
Well, pardon the pun, were any "get
out of jail free" cards handed out?

49:55.687 --> 49:59.066
No. I'm very
committed to the relationship.

49:59.233 --> 50:00.566
How about for her?

50:05.989 --> 50:07.408
No.

50:08.742 --> 50:13.579
No, we never
discussed any agreements.

50:13.705 --> 50:17.000
Which was probably naive of us.

50:18.043 --> 50:20.754
You know,
it's funny, whenever we

50:20.921 --> 50:23.673
talked about
cheating in an abstract way,

50:24.716 --> 50:27.052
I always said I wouldn't
care if she had sex

50:27.177 --> 50:29.555
with someone else,
if it's just sex.

50:29.846 --> 50:35.185
But suppose, theoretically,

50:35.936 --> 50:39.940
that someone she loved
was in there with her.

50:40.065 --> 50:42.317
Someone she had history with.

50:43.902 --> 50:49.116
Someone who could understand
her life in there

50:49.241 --> 50:52.953
in a way that I'll
never be able to.

50:53.787 --> 50:57.082
It would be
devastating to think that

50:57.165 --> 51:00.419
that person could give her
something that I can't.

51:02.670 --> 51:05.715
It would be way
worse than just sex.

51:07.509 --> 51:10.762
It would be...

51:11.972 --> 51:13.890
It would be a betrayal.

51:23.484 --> 51:24.776
He knows.

51:29.864 --> 51:32.117
It's not phone
hours yet, Chapman.

51:32.909 --> 51:34.495
This is an emergency.

51:34.620 --> 51:37.100
Go eat lunch. You can deal with
your emergency in a few minutes,

51:37.164 --> 51:38.999
just like everyone else.

51:41.876 --> 51:43.629
Nice radio play.

51:44.879 --> 51:46.256
Oh, my God.

52:09.363 --> 52:10.947
He used a condom.

52:11.072 --> 52:12.199
Do you have it?

52:12.366 --> 52:14.368
No. He took it with him.

52:14.535 --> 52:15.661
We went over this.

52:15.785 --> 52:16.870
I know, but...

52:17.037 --> 52:19.831
I couldn't do
anything about it. I...

52:20.374 --> 52:22.459
Well, you're just
gonna have to do it again.

52:23.918 --> 52:27.381
Better hope you were good
enough for him to want more.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.612
Oh, fuck!

53:42.330 --> 53:46.376
I am so, so, so sorry.

53:46.668 --> 53:49.003
I had no idea that
he was gonna say those things.

53:49.170 --> 53:51.047
Is that what you think of me?

54:07.355 --> 54:10.776
An inmate from Litchfield Federal
Prison is attempting to contact you.

54:10.858 --> 54:13.320
To accept the call,
please press one.

54:13.861 --> 54:15.739
So what did you think?

54:18.450 --> 54:19.701
How did you know?

54:20.160 --> 54:21.827
Know what, Piper?

54:22.828 --> 54:24.414
I know that you know.

54:25.165 --> 54:28.710
I want to hear you say it.
Tell me you had sex with her.

54:29.753 --> 54:31.004
Please don't do this.

54:31.254 --> 54:33.674
Are you still
having sex with her?

54:36.468 --> 54:37.552
Yes.

54:43.809 --> 54:48.980
Your counselor called me.

54:49.690 --> 54:53.901
Freely, Healy, told me he was
concerned about your behavior.

54:54.027 --> 54:56.363
He told me that you
had to spend some time

54:56.530 --> 54:58.906
in the SHU for
lesbian activity.

55:00.450 --> 55:04.329
So was this your revenge?
Trying to get me killed?

55:05.079 --> 55:08.249
Wait, wait, so, so, you're
the victim in all of this?

55:08.500 --> 55:09.710
They're just people, Larry.

55:09.835 --> 55:11.712
They're just women who are
trying to do their best.

55:11.795 --> 55:14.297
And you made them
sound like they were...

55:14.381 --> 55:15.382
Criminals?

55:16.257 --> 55:17.425
Jesus!

55:18.552 --> 55:20.094
Who are you?

55:20.261 --> 55:24.516
Who... I can't believe... You're
the one asking me that right now?

55:24.599 --> 55:26.226
I can't believe that...
No, actually,

55:26.351 --> 55:27.935
actually,
actually, of course, I can.

55:28.061 --> 55:30.896
I totally can,
because, because God forbid

55:31.064 --> 55:33.941
I would get to dictate
the conversation, ever!

55:34.401 --> 55:37.111
There hasn't been any
conversation to dictate, Larry.

55:37.237 --> 55:39.905
You haven't picked up the
phone in over a week!

55:41.408 --> 55:44.285
Do you have any idea what it
has been like in here for me?

55:44.411 --> 55:46.329
Do you have any idea
how lonely I've been?

55:46.413 --> 55:49.915
Lonely? Lonely, really?
You've been lonely, huh?

55:50.041 --> 55:51.877
That's... Okay,
that's interesting, because,

55:52.001 --> 55:53.837
you know,
I just assumed you were okay,

55:53.879 --> 55:55.463
because you have Alex now.

55:57.048 --> 55:58.425
Do you love her?

56:00.886 --> 56:04.806
No, that's...
It's difficult.

56:06.600 --> 56:08.017
Do you love her?

56:13.356 --> 56:14.482
Yes.

56:33.668 --> 56:34.960
She named you, you know?

56:37.839 --> 56:40.258
She's the whole fucking reason
you're in there.

56:41.134 --> 56:43.303
How does it feel
to be in love with

56:43.428 --> 56:45.639
the woman who ruined our lives?

56:47.181 --> 56:48.683
You lied to me?

56:49.768 --> 56:52.646
Guess that makes us
perfect for each other.

56:56.483 --> 56:58.610
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

57:01.321 --> 57:03.364
I think I need some time.

57:04.574 --> 57:05.951
What does that mean?

57:06.033 --> 57:08.161
I don't know.
I just... I need...

57:08.870 --> 57:14.153
I need some time, okay? I
need some time away from you.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.086
You have to let me fix this.

57:19.255 --> 57:21.215
I don't know if you can.

57:32.930 --> 57:43.121
