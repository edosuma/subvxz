<i>Nucky was like a son to me.</i>

00:02.754 --> 00:06.050
- But you're my flesh and blood, boy.
- So?

00:06.084 --> 00:09.340
So you're gonna take back
Atlantic City for the both of us.

00:09.375 --> 00:12.002
- We're all set for McGarrigle?
- My house Monday night.

00:12.037 --> 00:15.177
- <i>You're a credit to the cause, Nucky.</i>
- <i>Always happy to help.</i>

00:22.863 --> 00:25.260
You shot a white man
in the throat.

00:25.295 --> 00:27.293
I got four boys dead
in that warehouse.

00:27.327 --> 00:31.356
You do understand I'm the only
thing keeping you from a lynch mob?

00:31.391 --> 00:34.520
I can assure you that neither
I or sheriff Thompson

00:34.554 --> 00:36.720
will rest until these hooded cowards

00:36.754 --> 00:38.821
are brought to justice.

00:38.855 --> 00:40.822
These coloreds need
to learn a lesson,

00:40.856 --> 00:42.655
and we are going to teach it.

00:45.324 --> 00:47.323
Herman Dacus just died
from his neck wound.

00:47.358 --> 00:50.889
Find Chalky and place him
under arrest for his own safety.

00:50.924 --> 00:52.756
Will you stop worrying
for God's sake?

00:52.791 --> 00:54.257
I need to know
what's going on, Lou.

00:54.291 --> 00:56.790
Chalky's out of the game.
That's a pretty good start.

00:56.824 --> 01:00.026
<i>Got that whole warehouse</i>
<i>that's there for the taking.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:01.491
I want you to meet
the governor,

01:01.526 --> 01:04.259
cultivate relationships;
New York, Philly.

01:04.293 --> 01:06.292
- What's this?
- From Nucky.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.726
<i>A wedding gift.</i>

01:08.760 --> 01:11.194
Yesterday morning at Chalky's,

01:11.228 --> 01:13.127
you saw nothing that
aroused your suspicion?

01:13.162 --> 01:16.461
It happened after we left.

01:16.496 --> 01:19.630
- What the hell is going on?
- My name is Solomon Bishop.

01:19.665 --> 01:21.464
<i>We're with the attorney</i>
<i>general's office.</i>

01:21.498 --> 01:23.132
You're under arrest
for election fraud.

03:06.024 --> 03:08.358
<i>What a huge scandal this is.</i>

03:08.392 --> 03:09.859
<i>How long are we going</i>

03:09.893 --> 03:12.094
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- <i>What about our jobs?</i>

03:14.130 --> 03:16.331
We could possibly lose
our jobs over this.

03:16.365 --> 03:19.233
Morning, ma'am.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.637
Good morning, Katy,
Pauline, Lilian.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.572
- Ma'am.
- Mrs. Schroeder.

03:27.606 --> 03:31.007
- Are the children up?
- Just breakfasting now.

03:35.278 --> 03:37.312
That is today's press?

03:41.816 --> 03:44.351
Surely it either is or it isn't.

03:45.819 --> 03:48.287
She's going to find out anyway.

03:49.255 --> 03:51.289
I've been crying for hours.

04:09.472 --> 04:11.473
What is the prediction?

04:14.044 --> 04:15.378
Ma'am?

04:16.814 --> 04:19.281
For the weather.

04:19.317 --> 04:22.285
It's going to be nippy.

04:24.288 --> 04:26.356
Emily must wear her union suit

04:26.390 --> 04:29.525
and Teddy will put on
his heaviest socks.

04:31.595 --> 04:33.964
Oh.

04:33.998 --> 04:36.132
They made it themselves.

04:36.166 --> 04:38.400
I just checked the spelling.

04:44.941 --> 04:46.508
Will there be dinner, ma'am?

04:47.743 --> 04:49.477
Why wouldn't there be?

04:49.512 --> 04:52.579
But tonight, ma'am, for
the visiting gentleman.

04:52.613 --> 04:55.715
On account of the events.

04:59.587 --> 05:01.955
Katy, this rug must be
taken out and beaten

05:01.989 --> 05:04.724
before Mr. McGarrigle and
the other guests arrive.

05:21.408 --> 05:24.310
- Mr. Thompson's suite.
- <i>Mr. Kessler.</i>

05:24.344 --> 05:26.111
<i>Oh, Mrs. Schroeder,</i>
<i>it's not--</i>

05:26.146 --> 05:27.713
I've already seen the paper.

05:27.747 --> 05:30.583
- The report is not accurate.
- <i>Was he not arrested?</i>

05:30.617 --> 05:33.453
He is innocent.
This was not mentioned.

05:33.487 --> 05:37.156
- I'm going to the jail.
- <i>No, he's being bailed as we speak.</i>

05:37.191 --> 05:40.259
Missus, I must go.
It is mayhem.

05:40.294 --> 05:43.029
Was Mr. Thompson
able to--

05:51.971 --> 05:54.072
did you want me to do it now?

05:54.106 --> 05:56.741
What sort of coat do you have?

06:06.052 --> 06:09.221
You understand you're
in a precarious situation.

06:11.191 --> 06:14.225
- Uncertain, not secure.
- I know what it mean.

06:15.294 --> 06:16.660
It was for your own protection.

06:16.694 --> 06:20.331
On the steps of my own house?

06:20.365 --> 06:22.634
Where do you think
they came for me?

06:22.668 --> 06:24.402
Not a coincidence, was it?

06:24.437 --> 06:26.471
Klan come at me anytime.

06:26.505 --> 06:29.240
<i>Not as long as they thought</i>
<i>I could help you.</i>

06:29.275 --> 06:32.744
So why they think you
couldn't all of a sudden?

06:34.213 --> 06:36.214
What were you doing
election night?

06:37.549 --> 06:39.283
Basement of the A.M.E. Church

06:39.318 --> 06:42.587
handing out dollar bills to every
able-bodied negro who come in.

06:42.621 --> 06:44.590
And the other wards?

06:44.624 --> 06:48.661
I wasn't in the other wards, was I?

06:48.695 --> 06:51.396
Neary, Boyd,

06:51.431 --> 06:53.832
Fleming, O'Neill.

06:53.866 --> 06:56.301
Neary.

06:56.335 --> 06:58.536
Why?

06:58.570 --> 07:02.040
O'Neill just go-along-get-along.

07:02.074 --> 07:05.510
And Fleming, he couldn't lead a pig
to mud with a bucket of apples.

07:05.544 --> 07:07.812
But Neary,

07:07.846 --> 07:10.848
he a son of a bitch
ever since I run numbers

07:10.882 --> 07:12.783
for old Oscar Boneau
over in Georgia.

07:12.817 --> 07:15.185
Used to come around
for collection

07:15.219 --> 07:18.254
and he did like to give
a taste of that nightstick.

07:18.289 --> 07:21.925
- And Boyd? - You asking the
wrong question and you know it.

07:21.959 --> 07:24.661
Ain't a one of them pikers got
it in him to make a squeal

07:24.695 --> 07:27.698
lessen he be put up to it.

07:27.732 --> 07:31.402
Yes, and who could
have done that?

07:31.436 --> 07:33.971
- Isaac Ginsburg?
- He's my attorney.

07:34.005 --> 07:36.273
He posted your bail.

07:38.943 --> 07:40.477
What about me?

07:40.511 --> 07:44.280
Chalky, be patient.
That's all I ask.

07:44.314 --> 07:47.050
Please.

07:47.084 --> 07:50.153
I'll get my own Jew lawyer
down from Camden.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.568
Precarious motherfucker.

08:12.509 --> 08:15.544
<i>I won't pretend you're</i>
<i>inclined to be warm to me.</i>

08:15.579 --> 08:18.579
I wouldn't insult you like that.

08:18.613 --> 08:22.016
Because before anything else,

08:22.051 --> 08:24.919
I have great respect for you--

08:24.954 --> 08:28.790
your wisdom, your achievements.

08:30.693 --> 08:33.660
You're better spoken
than I expected.

08:34.863 --> 08:36.898
We never really talked before.

08:36.932 --> 08:38.832
You and Charlie are acquainted?

08:38.868 --> 08:41.469
We have someone in common.

08:41.503 --> 08:44.405
You hear, Charlie?
Discretion.

08:46.007 --> 08:49.043
Charlie volunteered to absent
himself from this meeting.

08:49.078 --> 08:51.113
He felt his presence
might be disruptive.

08:51.147 --> 08:53.482
But I counseled what?

08:53.517 --> 08:57.052
To not let the past get
in the way of the future.

08:57.087 --> 09:00.622
We are all learning,
Mr. Rothstein.

09:00.657 --> 09:04.426
And what can I learn
from you, Mr. Darmody?

09:04.494 --> 09:07.062
That things are changing
in Atlantic City.

09:07.096 --> 09:09.531
<i>If you're in the market</i>
<i>for quality liquor</i>

09:09.565 --> 09:11.967
coming in off the beaches
at a reasonable price

09:12.001 --> 09:14.903
and in good supply,
I can get it for you.

09:14.937 --> 09:16.838
You personally?

09:16.873 --> 09:19.908
Me, my associates.
I'm expanding my business

09:19.942 --> 09:22.244
and you are precisely the type

09:22.278 --> 09:26.014
of discerning customer
I am looking for.

09:26.048 --> 09:27.615
And Nucky Thompson?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.384
Nucky's like a father to me.

09:29.418 --> 09:32.220
I got a father.
Barely said hello in five years.

09:32.254 --> 09:34.321
Sorry to hear it.

09:39.795 --> 09:43.197
Who are you, Mr. Darmody?

09:43.231 --> 09:45.266
Pardon?

09:45.300 --> 09:47.469
You show up well-dressed

09:47.503 --> 09:51.106
with a silk cravat
and a bold proposal.

09:51.140 --> 09:54.642
A year ago you were
a brigand in the woods.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.544
Who are you?

09:56.579 --> 09:59.013
I'm a businessman.

09:59.048 --> 10:02.216
A veteran.
I just got married.

10:02.251 --> 10:03.551
Congratulations.

10:03.585 --> 10:05.919
I have a son, he's almost four.

10:05.954 --> 10:08.322
Cart before the horse.

10:10.725 --> 10:14.228
Do you have kids,
Mr. Rothstein?

10:14.262 --> 10:16.865
No.

10:16.899 --> 10:20.736
But I'm told they often say
unexpected and amusing things.

10:23.339 --> 10:24.973
I appreciate you coming to me.

10:25.008 --> 10:27.642
I applaud your audacity.

10:27.677 --> 10:31.646
And I give you my word that your
offer remains in this room.

10:35.485 --> 10:36.918
What does that mean?

10:38.988 --> 10:40.555
I'll show you out.

10:52.168 --> 10:54.269
Mr. Darmody.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.873
Don't you find it curious

10:58.941 --> 11:01.276
neither of us has mentioned
that Nucky Thompson

11:01.310 --> 11:03.144
spent last night in jail?

11:04.547 --> 11:05.847
He did?

11:05.881 --> 11:08.583
Election fraud apparently.

11:08.617 --> 11:10.919
Well,

11:10.953 --> 11:14.022
things seem to be changing
faster than I realized.

11:22.031 --> 11:24.132
Darmody.

11:24.167 --> 11:27.670
Look, A.R. don't like saying no.

11:27.704 --> 11:29.438
He doesn't like saying yes either.

11:29.472 --> 11:32.707
Not unless he has to.
You play poker?

11:34.043 --> 11:36.010
It's happened.

11:40.349 --> 11:42.050
Meyer's game.

11:42.084 --> 11:44.119
Come downtown later.
Sit in.

11:44.153 --> 11:45.453
I'll be there.

11:45.488 --> 11:47.422
This your idea of a setup?
Jesus.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.923
Thought you was a businessman.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.692
That doesn't make me a simp.

11:50.726 --> 11:54.262
You know what?
Go fry a fucking egg, farmer John.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.598
Hey, Charlie.

12:01.570 --> 12:04.872
Just give me the straight
dope, all right?

12:04.907 --> 12:07.809
Meyer thinks we should talk.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.778
Hey!

12:10.812 --> 12:12.647
- You can't block that hole.
- That's what she said.

12:12.681 --> 12:15.850
<i>This is all coming straight from</i>
<i>your old friend governor Edwards.</i>

12:15.885 --> 12:18.254
- How do you know?
- These state troopers,

12:18.288 --> 12:19.753
they're all Edwards' men.

12:19.788 --> 12:22.456
What does he want with his
shiny new police force?

12:22.490 --> 12:23.991
A big splash.

12:24.025 --> 12:27.260
- <i>And Solomon Bishop.</i>
- The state's attorney.

12:27.295 --> 12:29.496
The man who's going to try
very hard to put you in prison.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.832
- Here.
- I'm fine.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.734
Tell me he's poor but honest.

12:34.768 --> 12:36.636
He's married to a lesser Whitney

12:36.670 --> 12:39.339
and he set his salary
at $1 per annum.

12:39.373 --> 12:41.941
So not poor.
As for honest...

12:41.976 --> 12:45.045
You want to ask about
the indictment,

12:45.079 --> 12:48.014
I do not have a copy
of the indictment yet.

12:48.049 --> 12:51.318
However, I gleaned from
the courthouse clerk

12:51.352 --> 12:53.486
that your ship is leaking.

12:53.521 --> 12:55.121
Who is it?

12:55.156 --> 12:57.323
<i>Confidential witness</i>
<i>number one</i>

12:57.358 --> 12:58.625
and his boon companion

12:58.659 --> 13:00.760
confidential witness
number two.

13:00.795 --> 13:03.430
<i>They will testify</i>
<i>to direct knowledge</i>

13:03.464 --> 13:05.698
of widespread election abuses

13:05.733 --> 13:07.967
in county precincts
on November 2nd last,

13:08.002 --> 13:10.403
<i>including, but not limited to,</i>

13:10.438 --> 13:13.373
<i>voter intimidation,</i>
<i>fraud,</i>

13:13.407 --> 13:17.077
theft of ballot boxes and bribery.

13:18.779 --> 13:20.880
There's reporters out there.

13:20.915 --> 13:22.582
You want a lawyer at your side?

13:22.616 --> 13:25.585
That's what guilty men do.

13:25.619 --> 13:27.720
I'll get to work.

13:32.193 --> 13:34.628
Mrs. Schroeder has read the paper.

13:37.265 --> 13:38.599
What about the children?

13:38.633 --> 13:40.634
She did not say.

13:42.537 --> 13:45.739
The state police have
banished me from the suite.

13:45.774 --> 13:48.175
There were men touching
your possessions

13:48.209 --> 13:50.710
in ways I consider offensive.

13:50.745 --> 13:52.946
I could not stop them.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.785
Don't I have a treasurer's
office somewhere?

14:05.059 --> 14:06.927
Sir.

14:06.961 --> 14:08.595
There's a lady here.

14:15.936 --> 14:18.304
Mr. Thompson?

14:18.339 --> 14:20.806
No, ma'am.
Solomon Bishop,

14:20.840 --> 14:22.974
deputy attorney with
the state of new Jersey.

14:23.009 --> 14:26.311
When will Mr. Thompson return?

14:26.345 --> 14:28.847
You read the papers, ma'am?

14:28.881 --> 14:30.281
On Sundays

14:30.316 --> 14:33.351
<i>after the neighbors</i>
<i>are done with it.</i>

14:33.385 --> 14:37.088
Well, perhaps you can
borrow it from them today.

14:37.123 --> 14:39.324
Mr. Thompson's been arrested.

14:39.358 --> 14:41.793
Good lord.

14:41.827 --> 14:44.328
For what?

14:44.363 --> 14:45.863
The neighbors will tell you.

14:45.898 --> 14:48.299
Yes, of course.
It's just...

14:48.334 --> 14:52.170
I was told, you see,
that I could come here

14:52.204 --> 14:55.273
and Mr. Thompson would aid me.

14:55.308 --> 14:58.343
I have the two
wee ones and--

14:58.377 --> 15:00.511
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

15:04.316 --> 15:06.617
I walked here

15:06.652 --> 15:08.553
from Bungalow park.

15:09.755 --> 15:12.290
- Get her a glass of water.
- Thank you.

15:12.324 --> 15:16.027
But actually, may I use
the facilities?

15:17.196 --> 15:19.164
I think she may be
with child, sir.

15:20.533 --> 15:23.267
- Okay.
- It's this way, ma'am.

15:35.615 --> 15:37.450
<i>Oh wait, there he is.</i>

15:37.484 --> 15:40.420
Nucky! Nucky!

15:42.890 --> 15:44.990
So it's Christmas.

15:45.024 --> 15:46.692
A man is standing
before the judge.

15:46.726 --> 15:48.360
"Your honor", the man says,

15:48.394 --> 15:50.329
"all I did was take care
of my Christmas shopping.

15:50.363 --> 15:52.231
Judge says, "that's not
against the law".

15:52.265 --> 15:54.867
Man says, "it is if you do
it before the store opens".

15:54.901 --> 15:57.235
Ha ha.

15:57.270 --> 16:01.139
That one goes back to Cantor, pronto.
So a young woman--

16:01.174 --> 16:03.942
we didn't come down to hear
you tell jokes, Nuck.

16:03.977 --> 16:07.245
No? Well, I haven't told
you the biggest one yet.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.481
Which is that some people
in Trenton think it's funny

16:09.515 --> 16:13.151
to waste your tax dollars on
a frivolous political vendetta.

16:13.185 --> 16:15.452
<i>Some people in Trenton</i>
<i>can't bear the idea</i>

16:15.487 --> 16:18.123
that there's a place where the
working man, the family man,

16:18.157 --> 16:19.893
by God even a colored man can
take his wife and children--

16:19.927 --> 16:22.629
sure, but what's all that got
to do with election rigging?

16:22.663 --> 16:24.764
This isn't about rigging
anything, Harold.

16:24.799 --> 16:28.335
- It's about sore losers--
- How dirty is this town, Nuck?

16:28.369 --> 16:29.937
Is there an honest man
in Atlantic City?

16:29.971 --> 16:32.807
Is there a sober reporter at
"The Philadelphia lnquirer"?

16:32.841 --> 16:34.475
Be news to me.

16:34.509 --> 16:36.543
<i>Come on, Nucky.</i>
<i>How'd you fix the election?</i>

16:36.578 --> 16:38.746
- Thank you.
- You didn't give us anything.

16:38.780 --> 16:42.683
How high does this go?
How involved are you in this?

16:42.717 --> 16:45.152
I will not be tried
by the press.

16:45.186 --> 16:47.987
I'm going to use the same legal
system that's being turned against me

16:48.021 --> 16:50.054
and I'm gonna put this
business where it belongs--

16:50.088 --> 16:52.688
in the trash.
There you go, boys, write it up.

16:58.395 --> 17:01.264
Yeah, but it's
Nucky's town, Eli.

17:01.298 --> 17:03.499
And who ran it before him?

17:03.534 --> 17:06.234
Nucky was weaned
on the commodore's teat.

17:06.270 --> 17:08.436
There's a picture to
keep at your bedside.

17:08.472 --> 17:10.839
But that's the point.
It's a young man's game.

17:10.874 --> 17:12.540
I'm not saying that
the commodore--

17:12.576 --> 17:14.877
- How old are you, Damien?
- Commodore, I--

17:14.911 --> 17:17.179
how old are you?

17:17.214 --> 17:19.281
38, sir.

17:19.316 --> 17:20.415
Oh.

17:20.483 --> 17:23.117
He fall into the shoe polish?

17:23.153 --> 17:25.119
Pick up that tusk.

17:26.823 --> 17:29.224
- Commodore, I--
- <i>Pick it up.</i>

17:46.209 --> 17:48.410
Over your head.

17:55.420 --> 17:58.355
Give me that.

18:01.393 --> 18:03.592
And you're half my age, son.

18:06.462 --> 18:10.630
<i>Well, I trust</i>
<i>I made my point.</i>

18:10.664 --> 18:13.933
So you all showed up.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.202
That tells me that
we all feel the same

18:16.236 --> 18:17.837
about a certain individual--

18:17.871 --> 18:21.107
<i>the arrogance,</i>
<i>selfishness, neglect.</i>

18:21.142 --> 18:23.509
Let me take the fall
on St. Paddy's.

18:23.544 --> 18:26.579
Such is his method, Jim.
And then a wave of the hand

18:26.613 --> 18:28.814
and all is forgiven.
Makes me sick.

18:28.849 --> 18:31.417
And I say this as a bod relation.

18:31.451 --> 18:34.587
A whelp of 14 when you first
sat on my knee, right, George?

18:34.621 --> 18:36.989
Never forget it, commodore.

18:37.023 --> 18:40.258
Driving that buckboard from
a train station to my hotel.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.227
All came up together,
didn't we?

18:42.261 --> 18:44.162
<i>And back together we'll be.</i>

18:44.196 --> 18:46.898
Nucky Thompson's about to
hit seven years of lean.

18:46.932 --> 18:49.033
And woe unto them
that follow him.

18:49.068 --> 18:52.470
But he's just indicted.
And Nucky, he's pretty smart.

18:52.505 --> 18:54.072
I mean, if what we're
talking about here is--

18:54.106 --> 18:57.508
- plugging him in the ass?
- I like this little shitter.

18:57.543 --> 19:00.345
Well, how can we be sure?
I mean we, all of us, we got families.

19:00.379 --> 19:03.648
How's yours, Damien?
They like that new house?

19:03.682 --> 19:06.084
That was an accident.

19:06.118 --> 19:08.053
Wasn't it?

19:08.087 --> 19:12.623
Nucky Thompson's going to jail
thanks to Jim Neary and--

19:12.658 --> 19:15.192
- Patrick Ryan, sir.
- <i>--Eyewitness testimony</i>

19:15.227 --> 19:17.094
that nails him dead to rights
on the election.

19:17.128 --> 19:18.762
Which also leaves us the booze.

19:18.797 --> 19:20.497
How are you gonna
handle that, sir?

19:20.532 --> 19:22.132
Who's the chairman
of the yacht club?

19:22.167 --> 19:25.969
- You are, commodore.
- <i>With a solid tie to the coast guard.</i>

19:26.004 --> 19:28.939
What we ship comes in,
what Nucky ships doesn't.

19:28.973 --> 19:31.374
- You all know my son.
- Jimmy's gonna run it?

19:31.408 --> 19:33.276
- You're damn right.
- Kid's a war hero.

19:33.310 --> 19:35.711
- What about Chalky?
- That pickaninny's neutered.

19:35.746 --> 19:37.513
It's ours for the taking, boys.

19:37.547 --> 19:39.148
Hell, it's not gonna be easy.

19:39.182 --> 19:41.416
Nothing worthwhile ever is.

19:41.451 --> 19:43.987
But ask the man
inside you this:

19:44.021 --> 19:46.556
When you come face to
face with destiny,

19:46.591 --> 19:49.726
do you want to be the bear

19:49.760 --> 19:53.262
or do you want to be
holding the shotgun?

20:15.686 --> 20:17.620
Maybelle has a request.

20:17.654 --> 20:20.356
- Her beau.
- <i>Samuel?</i>

20:20.390 --> 20:22.858
He wishes to call at the house.

20:22.892 --> 20:24.560
When he want to do that?

20:24.594 --> 20:27.329
When would it suit you?

20:27.363 --> 20:30.198
Maybe a few days.

20:30.233 --> 20:32.634
I'm, uh,

20:32.668 --> 20:35.837
awaiting advice of counsel.

20:35.871 --> 20:38.106
Is he competent?

20:38.140 --> 20:40.208
He a Hebrew gentleman.

20:44.046 --> 20:46.815
Lester was quite insistent
about visiting you.

20:48.886 --> 20:50.922
This ain't a proper
place for him at all.

20:50.957 --> 20:52.624
So I said.

20:52.658 --> 20:55.093
He thought you might
enjoy something to read.

20:58.197 --> 21:00.331
Oh yes.

21:00.366 --> 21:02.166
It's a good one.

21:02.201 --> 21:05.636
Tell him thank you
from his daddy.

21:06.905 --> 21:09.807
And I'll see him soon.

21:11.510 --> 21:13.945
Mrs. White, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to--

21:13.979 --> 21:16.347
Yes, of course.

21:16.381 --> 21:18.416
Albert.

21:18.450 --> 21:21.285
You have a family
waiting that loves you.

21:24.523 --> 21:26.957
My Valentine.

21:42.507 --> 21:45.708
My my.

21:45.743 --> 21:48.344
Who that little lamb tail?

21:52.648 --> 21:54.382
Like the look of her?

21:54.416 --> 21:57.284
Surely do.

22:01.322 --> 22:03.358
Well, Buck,

22:03.392 --> 22:06.095
I'll tell my wife
next time I see her.

22:06.129 --> 22:09.067
Now I meant no offense.

22:09.102 --> 22:12.504
Got the pair of eyeballs,
can't help but use 'em.

22:12.538 --> 22:14.005
Suppose not.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.173
Name's Dunn Purnsley,

22:16.208 --> 22:18.643
up from Bawlmer on Friday.

22:18.677 --> 22:20.612
<i>Don't say.</i>

22:20.646 --> 22:22.614
$40 one pocket,

22:22.649 --> 22:24.149
corn knife the other.

22:24.184 --> 22:26.618
And friend, come Saturday night

22:26.653 --> 22:28.287
I use 'em both.

22:28.321 --> 22:30.055
Hope it was worth the ruckus.

22:30.090 --> 22:32.758
Was to me.

22:32.792 --> 22:35.227
So be it.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.299
What you got there?

22:45.805 --> 22:48.607
"Tom Sawyer."

22:48.641 --> 22:50.876
<i>Huh.</i>
<i>Well,</i>

22:50.910 --> 22:53.478
we ain't going no place.
Why don't you read some aloud?

22:53.513 --> 22:54.846
Y'all up for the tale, right?

22:54.881 --> 22:56.615
Read the first part.
What you say?

22:56.649 --> 22:59.417
- Let the man be.
- <i>You hoe darky,</i>

22:59.452 --> 23:01.553
ain't talking to you.

23:01.587 --> 23:05.023
This palaver between friends.

23:05.091 --> 23:07.759
- What's your name?
- <i>He Chalky White.</i>

23:09.328 --> 23:13.264
He is?
He is?

23:13.299 --> 23:15.700
I had no idea.

23:15.735 --> 23:17.569
You telling me

23:17.603 --> 23:20.105
walking around
this earth be a moke

23:20.139 --> 23:23.341
<i>dressed up like</i>
<i>ol' zip coon,</i>

23:23.376 --> 23:26.044
<i>fine high yaller bitch</i>
<i>by his side</i>

23:26.078 --> 23:28.346
and he called Chalky White?

23:28.380 --> 23:32.217
'Cause that be the most buckrnigger
horseshit I ever hear.

23:32.251 --> 23:34.919
What you say to that,
brudder tambo?

23:36.722 --> 23:39.290
I say you heard my name.

23:43.194 --> 23:45.996
I know you heard mine.

23:48.333 --> 23:50.267
Mr. White.

23:50.301 --> 23:51.968
Gonna have to move you across.

23:52.003 --> 23:53.970
Can't be mixing the races.

24:08.052 --> 24:09.919
<i>Guard.</i>

24:24.867 --> 24:26.201
Mr. Thompson.

24:26.235 --> 24:29.004
<i>This is unexpected.</i>

24:29.039 --> 24:31.274
- Enid.
- Eunice.

24:31.308 --> 24:33.876
- My office is?
- Right over there.

24:35.511 --> 24:37.946
I need you to call the sheriff
and the alderman of each ward.

24:37.980 --> 24:39.848
And the mayor.
Tell them I want them over here

24:39.882 --> 24:43.217
as quickly as possible.
Eddie will give you their numbers.

24:44.686 --> 24:46.353
Keep up the good work.

24:52.094 --> 24:54.996
I also need a florist.

24:59.501 --> 25:02.737
A cocktail fork.
On the left.

25:02.772 --> 25:04.706
Further left.

25:04.741 --> 25:06.308
A setting for
Mr. Thompson, ma'am?

25:06.343 --> 25:08.577
Curiosity is not
necessarily a virtue.

25:08.611 --> 25:12.047
- No, ma'am.
- He will sit at the head as usual.

25:17.287 --> 25:19.855
- Ah! Mom! Mom!

25:19.889 --> 25:21.724
What do you think you're doing?

25:21.758 --> 25:24.058
I'm sorry. We were putting
together a birdhouse.

25:24.092 --> 25:26.625
This is not a plaything.

25:26.660 --> 25:28.561
- You will go to your room.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.097
You will sit in your chair
and reflect on your conduct.

25:31.131 --> 25:33.365
Is that clear?

25:33.400 --> 25:37.069
Go to the kitchen, dear.
Pauline will get you something sweet.

25:40.507 --> 25:43.809
- Yes?
- I'm not a burglar.

25:43.844 --> 25:47.446
Though I do confess to
crawling out a window or two.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.548
What can I do for you?

25:49.582 --> 25:53.185
You can tell Mrs. Thompson that
John McGarrigle's man is here.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.957
Off you go.
There's a good Colleen.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.926
There is no
Mrs. Thompson.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.996
Then I'll speak with the
lady of the household.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.632
You are speaking with her.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.837
<i>Mea maxima culpa,</i> missus.

26:14.507 --> 26:17.842
I'm Owen Sleater.
I assist Mr. John McGarrigle.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.446
Then you're quite early.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.481
Your daughters?

26:26.418 --> 26:29.453
Only the little one.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.692
Well, rather dark

26:34.727 --> 26:36.561
all of a sudden

26:36.595 --> 26:38.296
in this hole I've
dug for myself.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.364
What do you want,
Mr. Sleater?

26:40.399 --> 26:42.333
With your kind
permission, ma'am,

26:42.367 --> 26:45.703
I'm to ensure your home is safe for
Mr. McGarrigle's visit this evening.

26:45.738 --> 26:50.075
We're not much given to
threatening our guests.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.211
You do have the hammer.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.449
My son seems
to think it's a toy.

26:57.483 --> 26:58.883
And where is he?

26:58.918 --> 27:01.152
In his room.

27:01.186 --> 27:03.321
He's seven.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.324
Well, we won't be too
vexed about him then.

27:06.358 --> 27:09.060
May I?

27:09.094 --> 27:10.695
Sorry for the bother.

27:20.572 --> 27:22.740
Why don't you leave off that?

27:22.774 --> 27:24.308
Huh?

27:24.343 --> 27:28.079
He wants you to shut that
flytrap you got hanging down.

27:28.113 --> 27:29.814
Got a cold or something.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.716
So don't be passing it to me.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.652
- Where I supposed to go?
- He got you there, friend.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.754
We's in it together.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.391
Now what Dunn Purnsley do?

27:39.425 --> 27:42.561
Find that little place up here,

27:42.595 --> 27:44.229
can't nobody get to.

27:44.264 --> 27:46.999
Hell, I done three
years in ankle chains

27:47.033 --> 27:48.634
like it was taking a nap.

27:48.669 --> 27:52.472
Chalky White know what I'm
talking about, don't he?

27:52.506 --> 27:54.506
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

27:54.541 --> 27:57.108
<i>I bet he up</i>
<i>there right now.</i>

27:57.142 --> 27:59.943
All soft and pillowy,

27:59.978 --> 28:02.747
honey bee wife fetching
plates of greens,

28:02.781 --> 28:04.982
roast beef,

28:05.017 --> 28:06.850
reading "Tom Sawyer."

28:06.885 --> 28:09.152
Ain't that so, Chalky White?

28:10.722 --> 28:13.758
- Might could be.
- <i>Oh yeah.</i>

28:14.826 --> 28:19.029
Maybe I climb up
there with you,

28:19.064 --> 28:22.766
jazz that woman up while
you be licking the plate.

28:33.979 --> 28:37.214
Well, Buck, you do
what you want.

28:37.248 --> 28:40.350
Just be you and your
right hand anyway.

28:47.993 --> 28:51.729
Now that's how
you play it, gentlemen.

28:52.697 --> 28:55.099
Oh yeah.

28:55.134 --> 28:58.369
We gonna get on fine.

29:03.308 --> 29:06.442
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

29:11.548 --> 29:14.316
- Am I late?

29:14.350 --> 29:16.218
Where the hell have you been?

29:16.252 --> 29:18.287
I came soon as I got the message.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.022
<i>90 minutes?</i>

29:20.056 --> 29:21.590
There's reporters everywhere.

29:21.624 --> 29:24.529
And these investigators
snooping around.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.831
I'm not proud of myself.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.899
I've been hiding in my garage.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.935
Where is everybody?

29:30.969 --> 29:34.238
I need you to tell me
if you were approached

29:34.273 --> 29:37.141
about turning against me.

29:37.175 --> 29:39.777
I'm with you, you know that.

29:39.811 --> 29:41.612
We're in business together.
We're building things.

29:41.646 --> 29:44.081
Nobody came to you?
Not Neary?

29:44.115 --> 29:47.251
- No. - Any of the bosses?
The commodore?

29:48.921 --> 29:50.888
How bad is this?

29:53.692 --> 29:55.259
I don't know yet.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.629
Are they gonna come after me?

29:58.663 --> 30:00.931
You got elected mayor,
didn't you?

30:00.966 --> 30:03.334
- You brout that to me.
- And you said yes.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.136
So it doesn't matter
what you say now.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.077
I'm gonna beat this, Ed.

30:14.112 --> 30:17.081
And when I do, I'll remember
who showed up here today

30:17.115 --> 30:19.283
and who didn't.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.251
Depend on that.

30:34.265 --> 30:35.899
Mr. Thompson.

30:35.933 --> 30:38.735
Mr. Kessler called from
your other office.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.370
It's safe to go back now.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.643
I don't see why
things got to change.

30:46.677 --> 30:48.011
Everybody's getting by.

30:48.045 --> 30:49.446
That all you want
from life, Damien?

30:49.480 --> 30:52.182
- What else is there?
- <i>A pair of balls.</i>

30:52.216 --> 30:54.785
- What's in it for you, Jim?
- Same as everybody.

30:54.819 --> 30:56.386
Less headaches and more green.

30:56.421 --> 30:58.455
But Nucky keeps
the Jack flowing.

30:58.489 --> 31:01.658
Where were you last year? Armed
robberies, shooting on the boardwalk.

31:01.692 --> 31:03.693
That's not a man in control.

31:03.728 --> 31:06.196
- And the election.
- We took it, didn't we?

31:06.230 --> 31:09.699
Too goddamn close.
If we'd lost, where would we be then?

31:09.734 --> 31:11.368
That doesn't mean
he's got to go to jail.

31:11.402 --> 31:12.969
The roads, we're
all in on that.

31:13.004 --> 31:14.505
Still will be,
with the commodore.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.939
But it's Nucky's deal.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.275
Get this into that
potato sack of yours.

31:18.309 --> 31:19.543
We're not in charge.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.145
The commodore wants Nucky
next to that fucking grizzly.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.547
That's what's gonna happen.

31:23.581 --> 31:25.248
But what's keeping us
from winding up with him?

31:25.283 --> 31:27.684
The commodore.
He puts the fix in, what do you think?

31:27.718 --> 31:29.419
He's dying his damn hair.

31:29.453 --> 31:31.154
He could serve you up
for Christmas dinner.

31:31.188 --> 31:32.722
And Eli?

31:32.756 --> 31:34.323
He's got Eli and Eli's the law.

31:34.358 --> 31:36.659
- What about the kid?
- <i>Look who his father is.</i>

31:36.693 --> 31:38.394
They get on top
of the booze, fellas,

31:38.428 --> 31:40.095
it's all flags and hallelujah.

31:40.129 --> 31:42.264
And anybody who didn't
sign on, he'll be lucky

31:42.298 --> 31:44.733
to work the boards
with a broom and a dustpan.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.616
Damien?

31:59.650 --> 32:02.886
Just say please, sir,
and thank you.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.799
So how does this work?

32:16.834 --> 32:19.569
I run the house.
Goes round the clock.

32:19.603 --> 32:21.671
The old neighborhood
people know me.

32:21.705 --> 32:24.840
Under A.R.'s protection,
so half to him.

32:24.875 --> 32:28.010
We've got other
enterprises too.

32:28.045 --> 32:30.913
Rothstein get a piece of those?

32:33.517 --> 32:35.017
Benny,

32:35.052 --> 32:38.254
<i>go around the corner and purchase</i>
<i>me one pound of halvah.</i>

32:38.288 --> 32:41.190
- Stuff will rot your teeth.
- I have a craving.

32:50.734 --> 32:52.067
What the hell was that?

32:52.102 --> 32:54.436
He does funny things sometimes.

32:54.470 --> 32:55.971
<i>Meshuge bisl yingl.</i>

32:56.005 --> 32:59.374
<i>Che cosa potete fare?</i>
Please.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.745
You met with A.R.

33:03.779 --> 33:06.849
He can be difficult to read.

33:06.883 --> 33:09.085
That thing of yours this morning,

33:09.119 --> 33:11.287
I'd have said yes to that.

33:11.321 --> 33:13.689
Yeah, but I wouldn't ask you.

33:13.723 --> 33:16.592
I need Rothstein, not the
fella that carries his water.

33:18.294 --> 33:21.230
The fuck's with you?
I make a friendly gesture...

33:21.265 --> 33:23.266
- Charlie.
- ...And this bust-out asshole--

33:23.300 --> 33:25.468
What, are we friends now?
You fucking come near my mother--

33:25.502 --> 33:28.338
Pally, she begged for it.

33:28.372 --> 33:30.139
- Gentlemen!
- What the fuck are you gonna do?

33:30.174 --> 33:34.144
Gentlemen, I'm running
a business here! Yes?

33:34.178 --> 33:36.780
Yes?

33:49.326 --> 33:51.727
May I call you Jimmy?

33:56.365 --> 33:59.267
Jimmy, Charlie and I

33:59.301 --> 34:02.303
have learned a great deal
from Mr. Rothstein

34:02.371 --> 34:05.706
as I am sure you have
learned from Mr. Thompson.

34:05.741 --> 34:10.178
But nobody wants to
be in school forever.

34:10.212 --> 34:12.213
As I see it,

34:12.246 --> 34:15.283
we have a lot in common.

34:16.485 --> 34:18.853
If we put aside
our differences,

34:18.888 --> 34:20.888
things could happen.

34:23.123 --> 34:26.025
- Such as?
- Trading partners.

34:26.060 --> 34:29.929
We buy liquor from you,
you buy something from us.

34:33.333 --> 34:35.802
And what would that be?

34:35.837 --> 34:38.572
We're thinking of
getting into heroin.

34:41.375 --> 34:45.344
When you run the numbers it
starts looking very attractive.

34:58.926 --> 35:02.696
Mr. Sleater, is the kitchen
sufficiently safe?

35:02.730 --> 35:05.598
It looks to be fairly buttoned up.

35:08.135 --> 35:12.104
Ugh, Katy seems incapable of
laying this down properly.

35:12.139 --> 35:15.341
Well, not much meat on her.

35:20.413 --> 35:22.581
Works a treat now.

35:22.615 --> 35:24.783
Thank you.

35:28.688 --> 35:30.890
You've been traveling
around the country?

35:32.292 --> 35:34.393
With Mr. McGarrigle, aye.

35:34.428 --> 35:36.361
Filling the coffers.

35:36.396 --> 35:39.030
New York, Boston, Chicago.

35:39.064 --> 35:43.167
It's support for the cause amongst
those that keep ties with home.

35:43.201 --> 35:45.703
"Ourselves alone."

35:46.972 --> 35:50.241
<i>Your Gaelic's a bit off.</i>

35:50.275 --> 35:51.942
<i>Sinn fein.</i>

35:51.977 --> 35:54.111
"We ourselves."
That's closer.

35:54.145 --> 35:56.380
In either case
it's what we're about,

35:56.414 --> 35:58.782
'cause who else
would fight for us?

35:58.817 --> 36:01.985
What do you do for
Mr. McGarrigle?

36:02.020 --> 36:05.589
As you see.
Clear the path.

36:07.058 --> 36:09.026
I was a livestock inspector

36:09.060 --> 36:12.261
before the rebellion in Coleraine.

36:12.296 --> 36:14.463
Well to the north.

36:14.498 --> 36:17.234
I make you from
the lonesome west.

36:18.637 --> 36:20.971
Kerry.

36:21.006 --> 36:23.307
Family there still?

36:23.341 --> 36:25.142
No.

36:25.177 --> 36:27.912
Here.
Apparently.

36:27.946 --> 36:31.115
Then you won't have
to choose sides.

36:50.737 --> 36:53.004
I thought first
to do the bedroom.

36:53.038 --> 36:55.972
But then I say he
must have his office.

36:56.007 --> 36:58.374
They are vandals, nothing more.

36:58.408 --> 37:00.809
See here?
A water ring.

37:32.073 --> 37:34.341
Damien Fleming.

37:34.375 --> 37:37.311
He says must speak to you.

37:47.923 --> 37:51.425
Nuck, I tried talking to them.

37:52.862 --> 37:54.896
I said they were
making a mistake.

37:54.931 --> 37:57.165
<i>I told them that</i>
<i>you were too smart</i>

37:57.200 --> 37:59.101
<i>to get sandbagged</i>
<i>by something like this.</i>

37:59.135 --> 38:01.770
They wouldn't listen.

38:01.804 --> 38:04.239
All they see
is the dollar signs.

38:09.445 --> 38:12.847
It's like the commodore, he
cast some kind of voodoo spell.

38:12.881 --> 38:15.150
Everything you did
for him, for us,

38:15.184 --> 38:17.252
it's like it never
even happened.

38:20.657 --> 38:22.324
Yes?

38:22.359 --> 38:24.760
<i>All alone, big brother?</i>

38:26.496 --> 38:28.230
Eli.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.866
<i>How's it feel</i>

38:30.900 --> 38:33.835
<i>sitting at your</i>
<i>fancy desk</i>

38:33.870 --> 38:36.271
<i>by yourself?</i>

38:36.305 --> 38:39.908
Eli, please, listen closely.

38:41.878 --> 38:44.680
If now, right now,

38:44.714 --> 38:47.082
you tell me you want
to get out of this,

38:47.116 --> 38:49.350
I will help you.

38:49.385 --> 38:51.252
I will find some way

38:51.287 --> 38:54.388
and we will come to terms.

38:55.724 --> 38:58.426
I'm prepared to hear
your side of it.

38:58.460 --> 39:01.262
But I will help you

39:01.296 --> 39:04.399
if you tell me now.

39:06.035 --> 39:08.436
Because in a minute

39:08.471 --> 39:11.372
it's going to be too late.

39:15.578 --> 39:17.245
Are you there?

39:19.481 --> 39:22.384
<i>You know the funny thing?</i>

39:22.418 --> 39:24.286
<i>Nobody takes power.</i>

39:24.320 --> 39:27.122
<i>Somebody else has</i>
<i>to give it to them.</i>

39:28.524 --> 39:31.292
<i>Look around,</i>
<i>big brother.</i>

39:31.326 --> 39:33.694
<i>What do you got?</i>

39:55.718 --> 39:58.453
I have a dinner engagement.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.931
Feels good to twist the knife.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.237
Now come meet the men
that made this city.

40:28.618 --> 40:32.421
Gentlemen, sheriff
Elias Thompson.

40:39.327 --> 40:43.096
<i>Propinate nobis similibusque.</i>

40:43.130 --> 40:45.098
<i>Hear hear.</i>

40:57.546 --> 41:00.615
The distinguished senator
from new Jersey.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.420
Is it bad if all the cards
are the same color?

41:05.455 --> 41:07.256
Jesus, just play poker.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.658
I'll see it.

41:09.692 --> 41:11.993
And I will raise you three.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.564
I'm out.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.434
<i>600 in the pot.</i>

41:19.468 --> 41:20.935
What are you holding,
<i>mon frere?</i>

41:20.970 --> 41:22.537
Straight to the nine.

41:23.873 --> 41:26.174
That'll pay for the holiday.

41:27.477 --> 41:30.011
Cash me out.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.782
Thank you for your visit.

41:33.816 --> 41:35.885
<i>You gentlemen</i>
<i>want to sit in?</i>

41:35.919 --> 41:37.719
New victims are always welcome.

41:37.754 --> 41:39.587
Why's every kike
got to be a wise ass?

41:39.621 --> 41:41.856
Why's every dago
got to be dumb as fuck?

41:41.890 --> 41:43.524
I'll bury you in your diaper.

41:46.362 --> 41:47.629
Benny.

41:50.432 --> 41:54.335
Gentlemen, I appreciate
the full and frank discussion.

41:54.369 --> 41:55.903
Fuck that.

41:55.938 --> 41:57.905
You respect the terms.

41:57.940 --> 42:00.608
And you tell
your <i>Frocio</i> partner.

42:00.642 --> 42:03.844
I most certainly will.

42:03.879 --> 42:06.914
<i>This place smells.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

42:08.050 --> 42:11.519
Come on, my uncle
needs to hear this.

42:16.024 --> 42:18.024
What was that?

42:18.059 --> 42:21.494
Representatives of Mr. Masseria.

42:21.529 --> 42:24.565
- Who's he?
- Mustache Pete fat-ass.

42:24.599 --> 42:27.001
Thinks he owns
the lower east side.

42:27.035 --> 42:31.172
A simple misunderstanding.

42:55.963 --> 42:59.332
What's that scamp tom up to now?

43:01.835 --> 43:05.037
He meet this little one here.

43:05.072 --> 43:08.307
They had a sweet time chatting.

43:08.341 --> 43:11.510
Th she play this piano.

43:11.544 --> 43:14.880
And what that say

43:14.914 --> 43:17.049
there?

43:17.083 --> 43:20.452
That say

43:20.487 --> 43:23.455
get your finger out of my face.

43:29.429 --> 43:31.863
I don't like about you?

43:31.898 --> 43:35.600
<i>That buck-and-wing suit;</i>

43:35.635 --> 43:39.237
<i>bright skin bitch</i>
<i>you strut around with;</i>

43:39.272 --> 43:43.775
uppity way you tell the world
you better than Dunn Purnsley

43:43.809 --> 43:46.478
when all you be
is another jigaboo

43:46.512 --> 43:49.314
in a jail cell.

44:07.700 --> 44:11.436
Harold C. Madison.

44:15.541 --> 44:17.575
How your daddy keeping?

44:17.610 --> 44:19.844
Tolerable, sir.

44:19.878 --> 44:21.913
He thank you
for the doctor bill.

44:21.947 --> 44:23.981
Noah Hookway.

44:24.016 --> 44:25.682
Mr. White.

44:25.717 --> 44:28.285
Things good down
at the gold room?

44:28.319 --> 44:30.887
Supposed to work today.

44:30.921 --> 44:34.326
I'll talk to 'em.

44:34.360 --> 44:37.362
Timothy.
Cornelius.

44:39.132 --> 44:42.067
Mama grateful
for the turkey, sir.

44:42.101 --> 44:44.836
All righty then.

44:59.852 --> 45:01.687
Catch.

45:01.721 --> 45:05.057
- Hold him! Hold him!
- Turn him around.

45:08.827 --> 45:10.594
Son of a bitch!

45:16.301 --> 45:18.803
That's right!
What?

45:39.524 --> 45:42.159
Purnsley be done.

45:48.199 --> 45:49.533
Sir.

46:01.079 --> 46:04.448
Which one of you boys
know his letters?

46:04.482 --> 46:06.817
I do.

46:13.991 --> 46:16.426
<i>"'David Copperfield'</i>

46:16.460 --> 46:19.029
<i>by Charles Dickens.</i>

46:19.063 --> 46:22.900
<i>I am born.</i>

46:22.934 --> 46:27.537
<i>Whether I shall turn out</i>
<i>to be the hero</i>

46:27.605 --> 46:29.405
<i>of my own life,</i>

46:29.440 --> 46:33.643
<i>or whether that station</i>
<i>will be held</i>

46:33.677 --> 46:36.378
<i>by anyone else..."</i>

46:41.519 --> 46:44.521
Is the lamb not to your
liking, Mr. McGarrigle?

46:44.556 --> 46:46.791
I've no doubt
it's properly prepared,

46:46.825 --> 46:49.427
but I eschew any flesh
that walks on cloven hoof.

46:49.461 --> 46:53.364
I was unaware
of your preference.

46:53.398 --> 46:55.566
It is no preference, ma'am.

46:55.601 --> 46:57.334
It is an ironclad principle.

46:57.369 --> 46:59.804
I'd say John is a man with a bit
of the devil in him himself.

46:59.838 --> 47:02.339
You're wrong there.
I hold no truck with him at all.

47:02.374 --> 47:04.909
<i>That's a challenge in this town.</i>

47:04.943 --> 47:06.410
<i>How do you mean?</i>

47:06.445 --> 47:08.346
Mr. Moran refers
to Atlantic City's

47:08.380 --> 47:10.348
- reputation for pleasure.
- <i>Mmm.</i>

47:10.382 --> 47:14.118
The whole of this country seem beset
by licentiousness and turpitude.

47:14.152 --> 47:18.489
Well, something else
not to your liking.

47:18.524 --> 47:19.891
It's none of my concern.

47:19.925 --> 47:22.326
My cause is to drive
the English invader

47:22.361 --> 47:24.829
from a land he has
occupied for 800 years.

47:24.863 --> 47:27.198
And I assure you,
we will succeed.

47:27.232 --> 47:29.767
Even if we're martyred
all along the way.

47:29.801 --> 47:33.237
That is an extreme position.

47:33.272 --> 47:36.607
Only to those who have forgotten
from whence they come.

47:41.346 --> 47:43.881
I know where I'm from, sir.

47:43.915 --> 47:47.218
And where I am now.

47:47.252 --> 47:49.887
You're plainspoken

47:49.921 --> 47:51.488
for a woman.

47:51.523 --> 47:54.391
<i>Now John, you ought to get</i>
<i>back here in the summer.</i>

47:54.425 --> 47:56.526
Why, I'll wager you've
never seen the like.

47:56.561 --> 47:58.528
- We get half a million people.
- <i>Oh!</i>

47:58.563 --> 48:00.797
- Nucky.
- Yes.

48:01.799 --> 48:04.266
I, uh...

48:04.301 --> 48:06.702
- Shaving it close.
- My apologies.

48:06.736 --> 48:09.271
Busy day.
Mr. McGarrigle.

48:09.306 --> 48:11.674
- Enoch Thompson.
- Rather a protestant name.

48:11.708 --> 48:15.178
A beloved uncle
on my mother's side.

48:15.212 --> 48:18.414
May we discuss the
matters at hand, sir?

48:19.783 --> 48:21.184
Of course.

48:21.218 --> 48:23.820
We just need to eat
something first.

48:23.855 --> 48:26.990
There's certainly
plenty of lamb.

49:42.064 --> 49:44.065
Just give us the Jack.

49:44.100 --> 49:47.502
I won it square.
I got no beef with Masseria.

49:47.536 --> 49:50.438
It's Rothstein's game.

49:50.472 --> 49:53.074
- I won't ask you again.

49:53.108 --> 49:55.877
All right.

49:55.911 --> 49:58.479
I put it in my boot.

50:07.556 --> 50:09.924
No, it's the other one.
It's the other--

50:54.035 --> 50:55.402
Another round of port?

50:55.437 --> 50:58.973
I've allowed myself the one.
I'll not have another.

51:00.442 --> 51:02.309
I guess I'm done too.

51:03.578 --> 51:05.379
No thank you, sir.
I'm snug as could be.

51:05.413 --> 51:07.848
Mr. Thompson,
the Irish people

51:07.882 --> 51:09.783
are at war against
a barbaric foe.

51:09.817 --> 51:12.986
<i>The English murder us in our homes.</i>
<i>They fire into crowds.</i>

51:13.020 --> 51:15.188
Last month they put
the torch to cork city

51:15.223 --> 51:17.724
and shot the firemen
come to fight the blaze.

51:17.759 --> 51:20.761
<i>We need guns and the</i>
<i>money to buy them.</i>

51:20.795 --> 51:23.563
Mr. Moran tells me you're
a loyal son of Erin.

51:23.598 --> 51:26.099
I call upon that loyalty now.

51:26.134 --> 51:29.136
What would you
consider sufficient?

51:29.170 --> 51:31.471
What do you have?

51:50.424 --> 51:52.491
Make it out to the
ancient order of celts.

51:52.526 --> 51:54.627
What did I tell you, John?

51:54.661 --> 51:57.730
Remind the boys at your next dinner
who their best friend in town is.

51:57.764 --> 51:59.565
Cash suits us better.

52:00.834 --> 52:02.602
I say the same thing myself.

52:02.636 --> 52:04.704
But today is not the day.

52:10.077 --> 52:11.912
Where are you off to next?

52:13.347 --> 52:14.981
New York again.

52:15.016 --> 52:17.016
Then the boat across the water.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.784
It's a pity you can't
stay in town longer.

52:18.819 --> 52:21.253
- I've seen enough.
- Huh.

52:21.287 --> 52:24.623
- There is one other thing.
- My man there.

52:24.657 --> 52:26.525
Owen Sleater,
Mr. Thompson.

52:26.559 --> 52:29.395
- He'll be staying on in the states.
- Why?

52:29.463 --> 52:31.030
I have no stomach left for it, sir.

52:31.064 --> 52:33.365
I mentioned that you might
be able to help him out.

52:35.502 --> 52:38.037
- Bring him around tomorrow.
- To the Ritz?

52:38.072 --> 52:39.906
Yes.

52:39.940 --> 52:43.276
No, I just-- you're back
in there? Good.

52:44.878 --> 52:46.679
If you gentlemen
will excuse me...

52:46.713 --> 52:49.548
I'll have just another after all.

52:59.059 --> 53:01.294
You needn't, ma'am.
I can manage myself.

53:01.328 --> 53:04.196
Faster with two,
I always found.

53:04.230 --> 53:06.331
Were you in service?

53:06.366 --> 53:09.167
You don't have to look
completely amazed.

53:09.201 --> 53:11.703
Do I seem that grand?

53:11.737 --> 53:13.805
I just didn't think
you were like me.

53:13.840 --> 53:16.842
Thank you for your hospitality
and contribution.

53:16.876 --> 53:19.144
It is very much appreciated.

53:23.951 --> 53:26.687
He recited the funniest
poem in the kitchen.

53:26.721 --> 53:30.558
A cow that walked into
a saloon or something.

53:33.329 --> 53:36.999
Yes?
And how did it go?

53:37.034 --> 53:40.069
Oh, I don't remember.

53:41.606 --> 53:44.008
Anyway, it was
a little naughty.

54:08.604 --> 54:10.805
I know we need to talk.

54:30.129 --> 54:31.964
Do they have a case?

54:33.400 --> 54:35.235
Yes.

54:35.269 --> 54:36.903
Who is against you?

54:36.938 --> 54:39.340
All of them.

54:39.374 --> 54:41.208
You must be specific.

54:41.243 --> 54:44.811
The ward bosses except fleming.

54:44.845 --> 54:47.379
The commodore
is pulling the strings.

54:47.414 --> 54:50.481
I'm certain Jimmy is with him.

54:50.549 --> 54:53.883
Will you not say
your brother's name?

54:59.121 --> 55:01.321
Eli.

55:03.123 --> 55:05.824
Eli is betraying me.

55:07.527 --> 55:09.794
I had no word from you
since last night.

55:09.828 --> 55:13.430
- I didn't want you to hear about it.
- How could I not?

55:18.534 --> 55:21.035
I keep people satisfied.

55:21.069 --> 55:23.503
That's all I do.

55:23.538 --> 55:26.272
They will not be satisfied.

55:26.306 --> 55:28.307
You know that already.

55:33.344 --> 55:36.512
The investigators turned
the suite upside down.

55:36.546 --> 55:40.048
What might they have found?

55:40.115 --> 55:42.049
The ledger book.

55:42.083 --> 55:44.418
It's missing.

55:44.452 --> 55:46.854
And some cash.

55:46.888 --> 55:50.357
How much?

55:50.391 --> 55:53.526
20,000, give or take.

55:56.562 --> 55:58.931
Not a lot, is it?

55:58.965 --> 56:01.266
In the scheme of things.

56:02.936 --> 56:05.103
It stings anyway.

56:23.891 --> 56:26.659
You are smarter
than your enemies.

56:26.693 --> 56:29.128
And you will persevere.

56:29.162 --> 56:31.363
But you're not thinking clearly now.

56:31.397 --> 56:33.331
You must concentrate

56:33.365 --> 56:35.166
and not give over to emotion.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.602
Where did you get those?

56:37.636 --> 56:41.272
From your closet today.

56:45.444 --> 56:48.079
This must be burned

56:48.113 --> 56:50.848
and future dealings
committed to memory.

56:50.882 --> 56:52.950
Do you agree?

57:08.668 --> 57:11.136
Poor Enoch.

57:11.170 --> 57:13.137
You're exhausted.

57:13.172 --> 57:15.939
I sent you flowers

57:15.974 --> 57:17.874
for Valentine's.

57:21.612 --> 57:24.746
I never signed the card.

57:24.781 --> 57:27.916
I knew who they were from.

57:40.093 --> 57:42.227
Come to sleep

57:42.262 --> 57:44.929
in our bed.
