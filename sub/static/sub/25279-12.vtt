WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:08.633
Bitch! Fuck!

00:13.054 --> 00:14.097
[groans]

00:14.931 --> 00:16.599
Where's my brother?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.351
Police! Hands where I can see 'em!

00:21.396 --> 00:22.272
Wilkerson?

00:24.691 --> 00:26.276
How about: balls where I can't see 'em?

00:27.610 --> 00:28.778
Shut up, Bennett.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.989
What's this all about?

00:31.072 --> 00:31.948
Nothing.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.575
It's all good.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.410
You live in a trailer park?

00:35.493 --> 00:36.953
I'll ask the fuckin' questions!

00:38.872 --> 00:39.998
What you guys fightin' about?

00:40.081 --> 00:41.666
Ain't no fight.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.710
-We're just talking.
-[Wilkerson] Oh, really?

00:43.793 --> 00:45.420
Oh, you weren't just on top of him?

00:45.503 --> 00:46.337
No.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.132
Just like I weren't
just on top of your mother.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.801
Fuck this! I'm takin' you guys
down to the station. Let's go.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.386
Whoa! Hey...

00:54.888 --> 00:56.056
If you're gonna handcuff us,

00:56.139 --> 00:58.308
you better go next door
and get 'em off your gimp.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.435
Fuck you, Bennett. Let's go, now.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.562
Move it!

01:03.229 --> 01:04.147
[Colt] What the...

02:19.472 --> 02:20.640
What are you doin'?

02:22.225 --> 02:26.187
Er... Just trying to clear a DUI
I got four years ago.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.399
Then I saw your search history.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.484
Did you Google "male breast reduction"?

02:32.652 --> 02:34.070
Yeah, for a case.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.197
Yeah, a case of the bitch tits.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.074
Sit over there!

02:39.784 --> 02:40.827
[Colt sighs]

02:43.246 --> 02:46.082
This is what we're looking at, Bennett.
You're out on bail...

02:47.417 --> 02:48.710
for stealing that generator.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.545
-Yeah.
-Then you go over to Nick's

02:50.628 --> 02:52.589
and for whatever reason,
you get in a fight.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.883
Oh no, I didn't get in a fight.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.384
I kicked his ass...

02:56.509 --> 02:57.343
allegedly.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.304
Learned that from a lawyer.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.265
Well, at some point
during this "alleged" fight

03:02.849 --> 03:04.934
Barbara June says
you threw a Weber grill at Nick,

03:05.018 --> 03:08.605
which ended up going
through the window of her '87 Fiero.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.190
It's a trailer park.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.818
No matter whether it's windows or teeth,
ain't nobody got 'em all.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.529
Look, man, I'm trying to help you out.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.949
Why don't you give Barbara June 200 bucks
and this whole thing goes away.

03:20.283 --> 03:24.370
Ma-- She doesn't even drive that thing.
She breeds rabbits in it.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.665
You watch yourself!
That's my girlfriend.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.459
Okay...

03:29.792 --> 03:32.378
you really call a prostitute
your girlfriend?

03:33.296 --> 03:34.589
Y'know what? Don't pay.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.300
I bet you wish
Barbara June'd say that to you once.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.429
I'm gonna charge you
with destruction of property.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.681
That's a bad look
for a guy already out on bail.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.308
They're gonna love you in prison.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.352
Yea-- fine, I'll give her the $200.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.104
Should I just put it on her dresser?

03:51.439 --> 03:52.774
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

03:52.857 --> 03:55.026
You wanna be a real cop,
you'll help that girl out.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.737
Now, what you gonna do to find Rooster?

03:58.446 --> 03:59.656
We've put out an APB.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.199
Just nothing's come back yet.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.952
You don't even care about him.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.036
Where's Beer Pong?

04:05.453 --> 04:07.288
He's out at a DUI checkpoint.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.206
Good.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.333
Somebody's doing something
to find Rooster.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.128
Look, we'll let you know
as soon as we find out anything,

04:14.212 --> 04:16.589
but in the meantime,
if I catch you back at Nick's--

04:16.673 --> 04:18.716
-[Colt] I got it.
-I will throw your ass in jail.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.343
-Do you understand?
-Yeah!

04:22.720 --> 04:25.765
When you put that badge on, do you ever
poke yourself and have milk come out?

04:29.894 --> 04:30.895
Hey, Colt!

04:32.063 --> 04:33.648
If you see Rooster tell him I said hi.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.649
I will.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.484
See you real soon, Nick.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.986
Looking forward to it.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.362
Keep moving, let's go.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.698
[door shuts]

04:42.282 --> 04:43.908
I can't believe you just let him walk.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.495
Just drop it.
15 minutes I'm letting you go too.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.254
Damn it! Did you change my password?

04:57.338 --> 04:58.965
Don't know what you're talking about.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.510
Bennett, if I can't get on my computer,
I can't help find your brother.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.096
I think you know what it is.

05:07.015 --> 05:07.890
Bitch tits.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.985
Hank... Mary here?

05:19.277 --> 05:21.529
What, you think I just sit here all day?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.489
You've got three parking boots
on your truck.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.449
Busted.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.118
Mary's in the back getting me chili.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.494
Mary!

05:28.995 --> 05:29.829
Hank...

05:29.912 --> 05:31.539
I wanna be you when I'm 60.

05:31.622 --> 05:32.623
I'm 40.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.170
All right, Hank, chili's free today.
Don't ask why.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.630
Oh, what happened to your face?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.592
Paid your boy Nick a little visit.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.053
Dickhead hit me with a bug zapper.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.096
What? Nick's in Ohio.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.389
Yeah, and Hank's 40.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.270
Nick never left town.

05:54.854 --> 05:55.897
He's in the trailer park.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.232
Are you kidding me?

05:58.316 --> 06:01.611
I was there yesterday, getting a bunny
from Barbara June for my grandson.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.154
Bitch tried to screw me.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.823
I know the difference
between a bunny and a trailer rat.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.116
Have you heard from Rooster?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.786
No, and I sent him my best boob pic.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.080
Spring break '98, but they're still mine.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.084
I'm telling you,
fuckin' Nick knows something.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.503
Let's go talk to him.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.713
If you go back there
you'll just get in another fight.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.964
Fuck yeah, I am.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.550
But this time I ain't gonna be mesmerized
by the bug zapper.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.886
I think it's better
if I go talk to him alone.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.515
I s'pose you're right.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.852
Ain't gonna do anybody any good for me
to get in a fight again, kick his ass.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.814
Which I did the first time, like real bad.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.066
Guy's an ex-con, but whatever.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.903
Every badass I know orders their burger
with a lettuce bun.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.281
Every badass who still wears
a size 32 Wranglers.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.827
All right, I'm gonna go back to the ranch.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.038
I don't hear from you in a couple of hours
I'm gonna do all kinds of stupid shit.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.873
Yeah, I know you will, buddy.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.339
Hank... they're towing your truck.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.174
Oh, no!

07:06.426 --> 07:07.677
I guess I can't leave.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.186
What are you looking at, Barbara June?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.981
I didn't touch your fuckin' Fiero.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.655
Hey, Mary, what's up?

07:27.738 --> 07:30.992
What's up? What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be at your brother's in Ohio.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.369
Got a job, lumberyard.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.080
Figured I'd just stick around.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.750
Couldn't get a job the 18 years you were
supposed to be paying child support,

07:39.834 --> 07:41.002
but, good for you.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.879
Y'know where Rooster is?

07:42.962 --> 07:45.381
Oh God! First Colt, now you.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.134
A lot of interest
in this <i>Duck Dynasty</i> reject.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.470
Nobody has seen him in over two days.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.889
I know you went to his cabin
and threatened him.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.765
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:54.849 --> 07:55.725
Nick!

07:56.309 --> 07:59.103
Look, a lot of people I care about
are worried about him.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.482
I need you to tell me
if you know <i>anything</i> about this.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.193
I will tell you again...

08:06.068 --> 08:07.278
I don't know where Rooster is.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.780
All right, look, a lot of this
I know is my fault,

08:09.864 --> 08:12.325
but once upon a time
you loved me and I loved you.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.951
We have a daughter together.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.621
So I need you to tell me the truth.

08:18.039 --> 08:18.998
Want me to be honest?

08:19.749 --> 08:20.833
Okay.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.586
I wanted to fuckin' kill him.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.590
I wanted to throw him in the curb
and crush his fuckin' skull.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.303
But I ain't going back to prison
for a piece of shit like Rooster.

08:33.262 --> 08:34.138
You know where he is?

08:34.222 --> 08:35.056
No.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.726
I did go to his trailer
and I made it clear

08:38.809 --> 08:40.561
that I wanted him to get out of town...

08:42.021 --> 08:43.105
and he left.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.233
And then what?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.817
Then I have no idea.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.115
The last time I seen him
was at the trailer.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.742
That's the truth.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.541
What a fuckin' mess!

09:02.458 --> 09:03.543
All right, thanks.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.044
Hey, hold on!

09:06.671 --> 09:08.089
Wanna come in and, um...

09:09.423 --> 09:10.341
have a beer?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.552
[scoffs] That's not happening.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.726
-Hey!
-Hey!

09:21.227 --> 09:22.270
What you doin'?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.897
Your father and I were watching
<i>The Searchers</i> the other night

09:24.981 --> 09:26.065
and we fell asleep.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.401
I'm trying to get it out
but it's jammed in there.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.485
Oh shit!

09:30.278 --> 09:31.988
That's his favorite John Wayne movie.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.198
Might as well be an American flag
stuffed in there.

09:35.825 --> 09:36.951
I can't get it out.

09:37.034 --> 09:40.746
I took it to Best Buy and the Geek Squad
doesn't even know what a VCR is.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.750
Geek Squad doesn't know what a date is.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.127
[she chuckles]

09:47.545 --> 09:48.629
Worst come to worst,

09:48.713 --> 09:51.507
you just tell my dad it's a home video
of my first steps.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.050
You know he won't care.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.636
Where is he, by the way?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.930
Oh, he got tired of waiting for you.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.976
Went outta here muttering something
about you and the goddamn wolf.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.185
Shit!

10:03.853 --> 10:04.729
Is he mad?

10:04.812 --> 10:07.231
Not as mad
as he's gonna be when I tell him

10:07.315 --> 10:09.358
you're the one who ruined
his copy of <i>The Searchers.</i>

10:09.442 --> 10:10.276
Hey!

10:11.819 --> 10:12.653
Where you been?

10:13.779 --> 10:15.489
Oh, I ran down to the feed store.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.617
Uh-huh? That where you got your black eye?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.076
[he sighs]

10:19.785 --> 10:22.455
All right, well Abby's
concealer's bullshit.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.042
I have a daughter who started
doin' drugs when she was 12.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.960
I've heard about every lie there is,

10:28.044 --> 10:31.213
starting with, "Can I borrow
some of your urine for science class?"

10:32.840 --> 10:33.674
Been there.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.010
No, I...

10:36.594 --> 10:39.764
went to talk to a guy about Rooster,
we ended up getting into it.

10:40.598 --> 10:41.557
You got in a fight?

10:42.516 --> 10:45.561
Er... just rolled around in the dirt
in a trailer park.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.022
We got arrested by a cop in his underwear.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.942
I give ya Toby Keith would be like,
"That's too white trash for me."

10:53.277 --> 10:56.697
I know it's a lot for you with your ranch
and your brother being gone.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.659
Hate to see you get in any trouble so

10:59.950 --> 11:02.953
I'm here if you wanna talk
or if I can help at all,

11:03.412 --> 11:05.039
or if you want some clean urine?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.001
Appreciate that.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.797
Hi!

11:14.382 --> 11:16.509
I just got off the phone with the police.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.094
[Colt] All right...

11:18.594 --> 11:21.514
Look, me and Nick got into it,
but there ain't gonna be no charges.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.142
They found your brother's bike.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.395
Where?

11:28.312 --> 11:29.689
Raton Mountain Pass.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.899
At the bottom of the cliff.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.409
[police voices]

11:48.374 --> 11:50.376
[distant police sirens]

11:54.463 --> 11:55.381
Shit!

11:56.507 --> 11:57.383
Wilkerson.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.760
What happened?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.388
Looks like he was carrying
too much speed into the curb,

12:03.347 --> 12:04.807
locked up his brakes and...

12:06.016 --> 12:07.059
went over the guardrail.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.728
Where is he?

12:09.603 --> 12:10.646
We're still looking.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.027
Nice and slow.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.571
My God!

12:21.323 --> 12:22.825
We're combing the entire area.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.869
Our search and rescue guys
are the best.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.331
We've even got a team in the river
that specializes in swift-water rescue.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.292
This don't make any sense.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.129
Rooster's been riding a bike
since before he could walk.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.173
He knows this road
like the back of his hand.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.010
Unfortunately,
we see stuff like this all the time.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.392
[Beau] Jesus!

12:56.150 --> 12:57.318
[Wilkerson] Colt, I'm sorry.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.278
[helicopter in distance]

12:59.403 --> 13:00.571
What are you sorry for?

13:01.697 --> 13:03.240
Just find my fuckin' brother.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.577
-We're doing everything we can.
-Well, fuckin' do more!

13:16.003 --> 13:17.213
I can't take this.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.924
I'm sorry. I only called you
'cause I thought you'd wanna be here.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.550
No, I'm really glad you did, it's just,

13:22.176 --> 13:23.969
the not knowing, y'know?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.429
I'm a nervous wreck.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.348
You got any weed?

13:27.431 --> 13:30.100
When your house burns down
you go through that pretty quick.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.645
-Oh, but I have some pills.
-Bingo!

13:32.728 --> 13:34.522
I confiscated them from my daughter.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.273
What are they?
Know what? It doesn't matter.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.943
I don't care. Here.
Best case, takes the edge off.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.070
Worst case, lower my cholesterol.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.241
-We should be out there.
-We walked up and down that river

13:45.324 --> 13:47.451
for two hours
until they told us to get out--

13:47.535 --> 13:48.536
We were helping!

13:48.619 --> 13:51.330
We were in the way. They're conducting
a goddamn investigation.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.666
-What's going on? What happened?
-Is Rooster OK?

13:53.749 --> 13:55.918
They don't know.
They don't fuckin' know anything.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.920
They don't even know
if Rooster was on the bike.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.171
They're still looking for him.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.089
[whispers] My God!

14:00.673 --> 14:02.091
They've got a whole search team.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.552
Oh yeah! They've got
their best people on it, too.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.304
All right, Wilkerson...
You shouldn't be allowed to be a cop

14:07.388 --> 14:10.224
if you've gotta step on a fuckin' stool
to wash your hands.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.851
Is there anything we can do?

14:12.726 --> 14:15.020
No-- What the fuck are we gonna do?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.565
We're gonna let them
fuckin' do their job.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.774
Do their job?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.485
I'm gonna call Maggie,
let her know what's going on.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.695
What? No!

14:23.028 --> 14:24.363
Don't call Mom!

14:24.446 --> 14:26.156
You'll get her all worked up over nothing.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.825
She has to know what's going on.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.869
Nobody knows what's going on!

14:29.952 --> 14:31.412
That's the whole fuckin' point!

14:31.495 --> 14:33.163
-I'm calling her.
-Y'know what? Fine.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.164
Call her.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.541
You talk to Nick?

14:35.624 --> 14:38.836
Yeah. He told Rooster to get out of town
but that's the last time he saw him.

14:38.919 --> 14:39.879
Do you believe him?

14:39.962 --> 14:43.132
I do. He's an asshole,
but I can always tell when he's lying.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.217
You also believed him
when he said he went to Ohio.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.554
-Trust me, he doesn't know where Rooster--
-Trust you?

14:48.637 --> 14:50.389
The only reason any of this is happening

14:50.472 --> 14:53.225
is 'cause you were fucking around
on your ex-husband with my brother.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.685
That's enough of that shit.

14:54.768 --> 14:55.811
Yeah, whatever!

14:56.770 --> 14:57.813
Where are you goin'?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.939
I'm gonna kill the wolf.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.649
-That can wait!
-Dad!

15:00.733 --> 15:03.068
Rooster's coming back!

15:03.694 --> 15:05.946
You always say
the work never stops, right?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.907
Well, I'm gonna go kill the wolf,

15:07.990 --> 15:10.659
and then when he gets back,
it'll be fuckin' dealt with.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.537
Fuck!

15:19.084 --> 15:21.295
Let me know if you hear anything.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.547
[banging]

15:31.764 --> 15:35.017
Rooster keeps hauling home
all these piece-of-shit bikes.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.896
He's never gonna do anything with 'em.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.525
This whole place is a fuckin' mess!

15:44.193 --> 15:46.195
[sobs]

15:51.742 --> 15:53.994
I'm the reason Rooster loves bikes.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.750
I didn't know you rode.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.836
I had an old piece-of-shit Harley.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.966
I took him on his first ride.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.384
[sobs]

16:09.510 --> 16:13.472
He couldn't have been more than six
or seven years old, Jesus Christ!

16:15.641 --> 16:18.268
We rode through
the Gunnison National Park.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.565
I thought maybe
it'd scare the shit out of him.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.110
He just giggled.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.030
Kept yelling, "Faster, faster, Daddy!"

16:34.576 --> 16:36.245
You can't blame yourself.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.914
I've been down that road.
It doesn't do any good.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.672
You think you can protect 'em.

16:49.883 --> 16:50.926
You think you can...

16:51.635 --> 16:52.803
keep 'em safe.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.100
And then you get that phone call
and you realize

16:58.183 --> 17:00.978
you've just been kidding yourself
all that time.

17:01.061 --> 17:04.356
Yeah, but he could still come back.
You don't know what happened.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.191
Oh, you didn't see that bike.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.279
You didn't see that drop.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.577
I didn't wanna say it in front of Colt,

17:16.660 --> 17:18.579
but Rooster's gone.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.997
[sobs]

17:20.122 --> 17:20.998
Honey.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.752
[contines to sob]

17:31.008 --> 17:32.509
[thunder rumbles]

17:41.685 --> 17:42.895
What are you doin' out here?

17:45.189 --> 17:46.231
Got it figured out.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.441
Figured what out?

17:47.524 --> 17:49.026
Rooster faked his death.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.447
He dumped his bike off that cliff.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.408
That way Nick thinks he's gone,
lets his guard down.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.786
Next thing you know,

17:58.869 --> 18:00.370
Nick's going over that cliff.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.873
This time you can find a body.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.085
Is that really what you think
happened to Rooster?

18:06.168 --> 18:08.003
All I know is Nick...

18:08.796 --> 18:09.797
he knows something.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.883
Mary couldn't get
the truth out of him,

18:13.634 --> 18:14.885
but I will.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.013
See if he lies to me
when he's got a gun in his mouth.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.392
You've got a wife and a kid on the way.

18:23.185 --> 18:26.271
-You're not gonna do them any good--
-Why should I listen to you?

18:27.648 --> 18:28.816
You didn't believe me

18:29.233 --> 18:30.818
when I told you he was missing.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.903
You said it was nothing.

18:34.613 --> 18:39.159
The only way to find out what happened
is to talk to this motherfucker.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.165
Rooster... had an accident and...

18:46.667 --> 18:48.961
all we can do is hope
that he made it through it.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.589
-You hear what I said?
-Shh!

18:56.426 --> 18:57.261
[gunshot]

18:58.595 --> 18:59.429
I clipped it.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.724
I'm going after it.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.684
Colt!

19:05.978 --> 19:07.229
Fuck!

19:14.903 --> 19:15.779
[Beau] Colt!

19:17.990 --> 19:21.618
You can't see blood, you can't see
tracks, you can't see anything out here!

19:28.041 --> 19:29.459
[thunder rumbles]

19:35.591 --> 19:37.509
Come on, Colt, let's go home.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.262
I don't need you out here.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.055
I don't want you out here!

19:42.139 --> 19:44.141
And I don't want <i>you</i> out here!

19:44.224 --> 19:45.726
Just fuckin' go home!

19:47.519 --> 19:48.478
[Colt cries out]

19:49.938 --> 19:51.064
This is crazy.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.692
You're hunting a wolf
in the dark of night

19:53.775 --> 19:55.986
in the middle of a goddamn rain storm.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.198
I'm getting the fuckin' wolf!

20:05.829 --> 20:08.040
[Mary] You sure you don't wanna try
and get some sleep?

20:08.123 --> 20:11.210
You could wash down
one of my daughter's pills with NyQuil,

20:11.960 --> 20:12.878
see what happens?

20:15.088 --> 20:16.924
I just wanna sit here for a while.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.930
I wish there was more I could do to help.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.307
You've done plenty.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.728
You should probably head to bed.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.940
No sense in the both of us
being exhausted.

20:33.899 --> 20:34.775
Are you sure?

20:34.858 --> 20:35.692
Yeah.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.028
Okay.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.326
But I'm here if you need me.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.009
[country song plays quietly on radio]

21:32.582 --> 21:33.625
Told you I'd get it.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.127
Good work.

21:41.675 --> 21:42.509
Jeez...

21:43.385 --> 21:45.721
Rooster is gonna be
so pissed he missed it.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.058
-[Beau] Who's gonna take it?
-We should get it stuffed.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.311
You can put it inside the cabin,

21:53.145 --> 21:55.105
like it's attacking,
he'd go an' freak out.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.858
We can put a camera in its mouth.

21:57.941 --> 22:01.069
Never have too much video
of your brother shitting his pants.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.574
[Colt chuckles manically]

22:06.033 --> 22:07.200
I'm glad it's over.

22:08.160 --> 22:08.994
Yeah.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.872
-Come on, let's head inside.
-No.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.165
Fuck that!

22:14.124 --> 22:17.044
Took care of one problem,
it's time to take care of another.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.212
I'm gonna go see Nick.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.215
You better stay away from there.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.593
I ain't givin' up.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.637
I'm not asking you to.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.434
I'm asking you
not to do something stupid.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.981
You'll end up in a jail cell...

22:39.483 --> 22:40.984
or in a hole in the ground.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.362
I hate him.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.323
Sit down.

22:47.783 --> 22:48.950
Sit!

22:49.701 --> 22:50.702
We don't have time.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.662
Please.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.514
You know that folded-up flag
in the living room?

23:12.641 --> 23:13.475
Uncle Greg's?

23:14.810 --> 23:15.769
Yeah.

23:16.686 --> 23:20.399
[laughs] I remember that time
you got all pissed off

23:20.482 --> 23:22.567
'cause Rooster's running around with it
like a cape.

23:26.738 --> 23:30.242
Our units shipped off to Vietnam
within a week of each other.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.537
My poor mother.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.792
Both her sons fighting a war
a lot of people didn't believe in.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.130
My brother was a hell of a soldier.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.882
I bet he was.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.763
Greg and I'd write letters
to each other every week.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.809
Nothing special, just...

23:57.561 --> 23:59.104
someone to talk to.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.732
Someone who understood.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.029
Two weeks...

24:10.240 --> 24:11.908
before the end of my tour, I...

24:13.118 --> 24:14.369
got word that...

24:16.079 --> 24:19.040
his platoon got ambushed
outside of Can Tho...

24:21.042 --> 24:22.502
and he was MIA.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.716
Happy fuckin' Easter!

24:33.889 --> 24:36.558
They wanted to ship me home,
but I re-upped.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.022
My mom found out, she begged me not to...

24:43.440 --> 24:45.275
but I knew Greg was alive...

24:47.110 --> 24:48.528
and I was gonna find him.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.446
[Colt] Dad...

24:50.572 --> 24:52.949
-I see what you're doing.
-You shut the fuck up!

24:53.658 --> 24:54.493
Let me finish.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.454
I chased down every river...

24:58.747 --> 24:59.748
for Greg.

25:02.417 --> 25:03.502
Came up empty.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.881
Then one day, a mortar came in.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.635
I ended up in the field hospital,
lucky to be alive.

25:15.722 --> 25:16.681
Chasing a ghost...

25:19.434 --> 25:20.810
almost got me killed.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.817
I can't lose both my sons.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.239
[voice falters] I just can't.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.495
You ain't gonna lose me.

25:41.456 --> 25:43.333
You haven't lost Rooster.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.211
He's alive.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.547
And this fuckin' Nick...

25:49.089 --> 25:52.342
This motherfucker,
this fuckin' piece of shit!

25:52.425 --> 25:54.594
He's gonna fuckin' tell me where he is!

26:01.643 --> 26:02.561
[door knocks]

26:16.491 --> 26:17.492
Are you Nick?

26:18.159 --> 26:19.077
Yeah. Why?

26:19.744 --> 26:20.662
I'm Beau Bennett.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.290
Colt and Rooster are my sons.

26:23.707 --> 26:26.668
Look, man, I already told Colt--
Fuck, I already told everybody...

26:27.168 --> 26:28.712
I don't know where Rooster is.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.091
You need to get outta town.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.469
-Maybe you need to get off my porch.
-Listen to me.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.015
I got one son gone...

26:40.974 --> 26:43.685
and another one thinks
you had something to do with it.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.732
I'm not gonna let him go to jail
for something he might do to you.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.570
Now get your shit together and go.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.741
Why the fuck would I listen to you?!

26:57.824 --> 27:00.118
'Cause I'm a 72-year-old man

27:00.201 --> 27:03.955
who wouldn't mind spending the rest
of his life in an eight-by-ten cell.
