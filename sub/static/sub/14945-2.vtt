I'm a really hard worker
with some fresh ideas,

00:06.591 --> 00:07.706
I won't let you down.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.256
Why all of this?

00:09.552 --> 00:12.419
Leaving home so suddenly,
giving up your work?

00:12.513 --> 00:13.844
l have to make
my own way for myself,

00:13.931 --> 00:16.183
it's not for you,
or Roland or anyone.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.928

00:29.614 --> 00:31.946

01:09.111 --> 01:10.726
I think the term
"fighting machine"

01:10.821 --> 01:12.436
has become something
of a cliche

01:12.531 --> 01:14.067
in the development
of the enhanced soldier,

01:14.158 --> 01:16.991
but what we've accomplished
here is nothing short
of extraordinary.

01:17.495 --> 01:18.826
Very impressive.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.030
I speak for
the entire corporation,
job well done.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.740

our funding decision

01:24.835 --> 01:27.668

What does that mean?

01:37.223 --> 01:38.713
What happens
to these soldiers?

01:39.183 --> 01:40.514
Well, we can't leave
anything operational

01:40.601 --> 01:42.557
once we've shut down,
way too risky.

ease your mind
over dinner later?

Well, maybe when
the project's finished...

is I hope when...

he'd say, "Leave
no comrade behind."

He would,
but he'd also say,
"Think before you act."

stop thinking
and start acting?

as our official liaison.

11:40.951 --> 11:44.159
Regardless of the hiccups
that ourjoint operations

11:44.246 --> 11:45.611
have experienced as of late,

11:45.706 --> 11:48.197
we're ready to provide
any support that we can.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.657
Well, thank you for that.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.003
I'm sure all of us
can agree that
we could always use

11:52.087 --> 11:54.373
another ally in the war
against terrorism.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.171
Now, Travis Verta
is a high value member

11:57.259 --> 11:59.124
so I expect Liber8 to make
a move of some kind.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.301
Now with all
due respect,
I'm not sure

12:01.388 --> 12:04.050
that agent Cameron's
considered all
the variables in this case.

12:04.141 --> 12:07.304
I don't know,
maybe she has and
she's counting on them.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.468
I'd be surprised
ifyou could find someone

12:09.563 --> 12:11.849
who understands
them better,
Agent Gardiner,

12:11.982 --> 12:15.145
and l have a plan that
will keep any of your
concerns at a minimum.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.693
You stay out of my way
and we all get what we want.

12:19.698 --> 12:20.938
I look forward to that.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.193
Excuse me...

12:25.037 --> 12:26.447
No love lost, huh?

12:26.538 --> 12:28.915
That guy needs a serious
attitude adjustment.

12:28.999 --> 12:32.207
Easy, that is a shortcut
to an early retirement.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.493
He's gonna be looking for
anything to call you out on.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.794
Oh, I'm sure of it.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.338
You're setting
yourself up for trouble
if it goes sideways.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.497
I know.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.343
Hey, how about
we hear about
this plan?

12:44.640 --> 12:47.928
It's, uh...
It's gonna play out
something like this.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.810
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
Sadler,
do you have any idea

12:52.898 --> 12:54.729
why all of the network
passwords aren't working?

12:54.816 --> 12:56.602
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I forgot to tell
you about that.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.604
Um, I had to flash
the router with
an open WRT

12:58.695 --> 13:00.435
in order to put up
a new firewall.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.145
Why did you do that?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.151
Well, um, actually
you'll be happy to know

13:04.242 --> 13:05.322
that l recalibrated
the network

13:05.410 --> 13:06.866
so that 46 percent
of the customers

13:06.954 --> 13:08.535
can now use the automated
checkout system.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.491
ThatHsave
on labor costs
by 15 percent

13:10.582 --> 13:11.822
and decrease
customer wait times

13:11.917 --> 13:13.623
by a minute
and 30 seconds
on average.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.375
Is that right?
Yeah.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.378
And you don't have
to do sales reports anymore,
it's all automated now.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.626
No sales reports?
Nope, poof, gone!

13:20.717 --> 13:21.832
Straight to head office.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.921
it's 256 percent
to be exact.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.932
Okay...
Sadler, here's
what's gonna happen.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.431
First, you're gonna
get me a coffee.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.933
Then you're gonna undo
all this mumbojumbo,

13:36.024 --> 13:37.639
none of this was even
approved by head office.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.065
This'll save
the company money...

13:39.152 --> 13:41.985
Look, I know what
it's like to be
young and ambitious

13:42.072 --> 13:43.903
and think I have
the answers to everything,

13:43.991 --> 13:46.107
but you can't go
messing with the system
just because you think

13:46.243 --> 13:48.108
you have a better
way of doing things.
But I'm telling you...

13:48.245 --> 13:50.156
No, look, I'm telling
you to reset the network

13:50.247 --> 13:52.579
to the way that it was
and do the job that
I hired you to do.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.573
I can un-hire you
just as easily.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.420
Oh, and that coffee?
Make it black.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.553
Incredible.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.177
What do you want?
You know who I am?

14:12.519 --> 14:15.010
Right. Well, believe it
or not I know a little bit

14:15.105 --> 14:16.436
about who you are as well.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.435
Maybe even more than
you know about yourself.

14:19.985 --> 14:23.068
Look, if Kiera sent
you here to talk me
into whatever...

14:23.155 --> 14:24.941
Kiera didn't send me.

14:26.575 --> 14:30.238
You know I had ajob
like this once, way back...

14:30.328 --> 14:31.579
Or is that way forward?

14:31.913 --> 14:34.370
Mopping floors
and cleaning toilets.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.199
Good, honest work
my father called it.

14:38.253 --> 14:41.791
I hated thatjob
but I guess it did
teach me something.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.129
And what's that?

14:43.759 --> 14:47.001
Well, first off,
money and power doesn't
mean your shit doesn't stink.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.670
More importantly,

14:49.765 --> 14:53.849
the only thing separating
me and the future I wanted
was will.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.557
I had the talent
and the ambition,

14:58.190 --> 15:00.146
all I needed was a chance.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.936
The problem is,
of course, you're rarely
given that chance,

15:03.028 --> 15:04.814
more often than not
you've gotta take it.

15:05.322 --> 15:08.906
So one day,
on my knees cleaning up

15:08.992 --> 15:12.985
where some idiot
had missed with
his piss, I did.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.073
And what did you do?

15:15.248 --> 15:16.579
lquit.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.999
l scratched and clawed
and willed myself

15:20.378 --> 15:21.788
into my own business.

15:22.172 --> 15:28.168
I put all that hard work
into Kellog Incorporated.

15:29.513 --> 15:32.050
And here you are today...
You've come a long way.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.302
That's one way to put it.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.930
Look, what does any
of this have to do
with me?

15:38.021 --> 15:39.522
Oh, I don't know...

15:39.648 --> 15:41.980
Let's just say that
both of our futures

15:42.442 --> 15:45.229
rely on your own will.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.359
All you have to do
is look down and realize

15:52.244 --> 15:54.451
that you're on
yourkneestoo.

15:55.580 --> 16:00.540
The only difference is
you're a genius.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.463
Anyway...
Listen, l'm, uh...

16:06.550 --> 16:08.256
I'm looking to set up
a new venture,

16:08.510 --> 16:09.875
cutting edge stuff.

16:09.970 --> 16:13.053
Also looking for
talented visionaries
to do visionary work.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.975
You know,
mold the future,
all thatjazz.

16:16.351 --> 16:19.559
Hey, money is no object.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.514
Uh... Are you being
taken care of, sir?

16:26.570 --> 16:27.776
Why, yes, thank you.

16:27.863 --> 16:30.195
Alec here is taking
very good care of me,

16:30.282 --> 16:31.317
he knows his stuff!

16:32.075 --> 16:34.566
KELLOG: You know something,
I'd be careful
if I were you.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.528
'Cause someone mightjust,
uh, just come along

16:38.415 --> 16:39.530
and poach him away.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.831
Wonderful.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.534
Uh...
Have a good day, sir.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.665
Um, Alec, when you're
done with this customer,

16:46.756 --> 16:48.496
can you drop
by my office?

16:48.592 --> 16:50.207
My printer's jammed.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.544
Printerjams,
how novel.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.423
You know,
there's no paper
in the future?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.599
Or should I say
"no future in paper."

17:05.650 --> 17:08.483
Drop by for a chat once
you've made up your mind.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.899
Incredible.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.667
(CLEARS THROAT)

17:26.796 --> 17:29.538
Um, ljust got word
from our prison connection.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.630
They're dead,
all of them.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.550
It's not a problem.
How can you
even say that?

17:34.638 --> 17:36.378
If Garza finds out
who's behind this...

17:36.473 --> 17:37.758
Listen...

17:38.058 --> 17:39.923
Do you honestly think
any of those Neanderthals

17:40.018 --> 17:41.633
ever stood a chance
against Travis?

17:42.771 --> 17:43.806
You planned this?

17:44.648 --> 17:46.764
Killing Travis would
be a nice solution,

17:46.858 --> 17:49.474
but we don't need him
dead so much as we need
him out of the way

17:50.237 --> 17:52.694
and as far away from
Theseus as possible.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.154
I should've known
you were behind
this circus.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.118
I'll take that
as a compliment.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.745
You would.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.830
Listen, Travis.
I'll cut you a deal.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.290
You tell me where I can
find Sonya and the others,

18:48.837 --> 18:50.702
and I'll put you out
of your misery quickly,

18:51.006 --> 18:53.713
save you the trouble
of the long incarceration.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.252
And miss all the fun?

18:57.721 --> 18:59.336
CARLOS:
It seems like you two
are getting along.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.629
Seeing her makes
me homesick.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.720
Your new home's
a four by four cell,
Travis.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.556
No fear, this one.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.223
Tell me something
I don't know.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.807
Why don't you take shotgun,
I'll sit back here with
Mr. Happy.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.656
CARLOS:
You look good
in orange.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.946
Hey, Simon.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.910
Think about
behaving yourself,

19:28.001 --> 19:29.582
so I don't have
to come over there,
keep you in line, huh?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.874
Please do.
CARLOS: Oh,
that can be arranged.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.208
Ready?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.415
So, let's get this
show on the road.

19:37.552 --> 19:38.917
(ENGINE STARTS)

19:40.263 --> 19:41.764
Convoy's pulling out.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.261
DILLON:
Nothing like a nice drive
through the countryside.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.934
The day is young.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.095
I guess being
a pessimist is part

19:50.190 --> 19:52.055
of yourjob description,
huh?

19:52.150 --> 19:56.018
Well,
I'm rarely disappointed
so that's a bonus.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.322
It's not too late
for you, Protector.

20:05.955 --> 20:09.368
Join the fight,
make this world
a better place.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.207
KIERA:
What do you think
I'm doing?

20:11.294 --> 20:13.455
TRAVIS:
I think you're fighting
for the wrong side,

20:13.546 --> 20:15.161
you just don't know it yet.

20:17.759 --> 20:18.999
Doesn't it ever
bother you?

20:19.469 --> 20:21.005
Oh, yeah, it's starting
to bother me now.

20:21.096 --> 20:23.087
I'm talking about
the inequality
in the system.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.173
Bankers and corporate
CEOs raking in fortunes

20:26.267 --> 20:28.974
while the rest of us
fightjust to survive

20:29.062 --> 20:30.927
and take care
of the ones we love.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.722
Iguess
I'm just used to it.

20:33.817 --> 20:35.603
That's your problem
right there.

20:35.944 --> 20:38.310
You're the reason
these thieves
get away with it.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.820
They need
your complacency,

20:40.907 --> 20:43.319
your unwillingness
to fight,

20:43.410 --> 20:45.617
to challenge the rules,
to tear down walls...

20:45.703 --> 20:46.829
Blow up a building?

20:46.913 --> 20:48.414
If that's what
it takes to prevent us

20:48.498 --> 20:50.659
from becoming slaves, yes.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.919
It's like I said,
no strings attached.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.421
You're the brains,
I'm the money.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.714
Thelab?

21:00.176 --> 21:02.337
Yours to run,
hire some help
if you like.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.176
I won't need any help.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.595
Even better.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.343
Kiera will probably
appreciate the privacy.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.550
Look, this has nothing
to do with her.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.977
Okay.
Understood.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.565
Look, I've seen what
you can do alone

21:14.649 --> 21:17.516
so I really don't
think we'll have
much of a problem.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.986
Please...

21:20.363 --> 21:23.947
Can I offer you a coffee,
tea, soda, beer?

21:24.242 --> 21:25.698
Soda, please.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.869
You seem pretty sure
this is a sound investment.

21:29.956 --> 21:33.448
Yeah, an investment
when you know the payoff
is not a risk,

21:33.543 --> 21:34.623
it's a sure thing.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.076
There are no sure things.

21:36.171 --> 21:38.913
Well, then I'm happy with
getting as close as I can.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.749
Where are we?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.172
It's all routine.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.386
TRAVIS:
They'll come for me.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.058
You know how all this
plays out, Cameron.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.308
She hasn't told you,
has she?

21:56.399 --> 21:57.388
(CHUCKLES)

21:57.484 --> 21:58.769
How does she do it?

21:59.736 --> 22:03.649
It must suck to be you,
always two steps behind her,

22:04.491 --> 22:07.983
almost like
she can see things
before they happen.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.488
Hey, can I ask
you something

22:13.583 --> 22:15.119
that might sound
a little bit weird?

22:15.668 --> 22:18.330
I'm a time traveler, kid.
Weird is my specialty.

22:18.755 --> 22:21.542
What am I like in 2077,
like old me...

22:21.716 --> 22:22.831
What's my deal?

22:22.926 --> 22:25.167
Straight to the point,
I like that.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.922
What did Kiera tell you?

22:28.056 --> 22:29.091
Nothing.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.433
Here's the deal, kid.

22:35.104 --> 22:39.188
In 2077, you are
in today's terms...

22:40.568 --> 22:44.686
Zuckerberg, Jobs,
Buffett and Gates...

22:45.782 --> 22:47.522
...all rolled into one.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.399
Rich...
No,no,no”.
Beyond rich.

22:49.494 --> 22:50.859
Epic wealth.

22:50.954 --> 22:53.536
No, you don't understand,
what am I like as a person?

22:53.623 --> 22:55.579
Uh... As a person?

22:56.125 --> 22:57.114
Who gives a shit!

22:57.752 --> 23:00.494
You're loaded,
powerful, like a...

23:01.047 --> 23:02.082
Like a king.

23:02.924 --> 23:06.007
ljust really need to know,

38:08.495 --> 38:10.110
of either group,
nothing.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.787
CARLOS: She already told you,
the first group had all
the signs of Liber8.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.536
They were bold
but reckless.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.036
The second group...

38:16.128 --> 38:18.244
It was like
a military strike,
they were precise.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.504
What matters here
is that both groups

38:21.592 --> 38:23.799
were apparently going
for the same thing.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.001
You know
what astounds me,
Inspector Dillon?

38:26.096 --> 38:28.178
Is that these two
were put in charge
in the first place,

38:28.265 --> 38:30.301
especially considering
that we're not even sure

38:30.392 --> 38:32.633
where Agent Cameron's
alliances really lie.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.435
Hey...
That is enough.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.805
You know, Gardiner,
I really don't care

38:37.900 --> 38:40.312
who gave you
the authority to be
a part of this operation,

38:40.402 --> 38:41.437
what I will not...
Inspector...

38:41.528 --> 38:44.235
What I will not stand for
is you questioning

38:44.323 --> 38:45.654
theloyaﬂy
ofmyoﬁmem!

38:47.326 --> 38:49.908
Regardless of what
happened out there today,

38:50.579 --> 38:52.535
the buck stops with me.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.363
I didn't see the threat.

38:56.001 --> 38:56.990
Is that right?

38:57.586 --> 38:58.917
DILLON:
ltwas the right call.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.916
Now I will file
the report and Iwill
take the heat for it.

39:02.925 --> 39:04.586
Yeah, I expect
that you will.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.420
We're done.

39:16.146 --> 39:18.853
Putting Travis Verta
into an unprotected
decoy vehicle

39:18.941 --> 39:20.477
is pretty cunning,
I'll give you that.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.064
Go to hell.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.566
Cameron...

39:32.204 --> 39:34.240
We both know
that you're not
what you seem

39:35.123 --> 39:36.704
and I got a pretty good
feeling those answers

39:36.792 --> 39:40.330
are gonna reveal
themselves as long
as someone is watching.

39:42.256 --> 39:43.291
I have work to do.

39:43.799 --> 39:45.835
Oh. Springing Travis
wasn't enough?

39:55.644 --> 39:56.850
(PHONE BUZZES)

39:56.937 --> 39:58.143
It's Garza.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.395
Yes?

40:01.483 --> 40:04.395
TRAVIS:
Sonya, you were right.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.485
You don't have much time.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.152
Keep moving.

40:22.379 --> 40:23.459
What's that?

40:30.178 --> 40:31.338
(GASPS)

40:42.190 --> 40:43.316
(GASPS)

40:49.281 --> 40:50.521
You okay?

40:50.699 --> 40:52.064
What was in that syringe?

40:52.159 --> 40:53.399
Something to keep
you moving.

40:59.041 --> 41:00.121
(GROANS)

41:02.836 --> 41:04.076
We don't have much time.

41:04.630 --> 41:05.745
Come on!

41:09.176 --> 41:10.632
We can't assume
anything's normal

41:10.719 --> 41:12.675
if there's a spy
in the department.
(SIGHS)

41:12.763 --> 41:14.173
Yeah, I know.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.596
We need to add
another layer
of secrecy.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.434
That's gonna get weird.

41:18.685 --> 41:19.925
Going to get weird?

41:20.395 --> 41:22.386
You mean, weirder
than time travel stories?

41:23.649 --> 41:25.890
Yeah, that was
pretty out there.

41:26.443 --> 41:27.603
Yeah.

41:27.694 --> 41:30.071
You know,
what's strange was
how Travis decided

41:30.155 --> 41:32.692
he wanted to lump you
into his crazy delusions.

41:34.326 --> 41:35.657
Crazy is crazy.

41:37.788 --> 41:38.777
Yeah.

41:40.666 --> 41:43.032
Since you're in the mood
for out there ideas,

41:43.543 --> 41:45.920
here's one I'd like
to run by you.
Shoot

41:46.838 --> 41:49.045
Our department spy,
the mole,

41:49.716 --> 41:51.456
knows just enough
to screw us over,

41:51.802 --> 41:54.418
make us look bad and
undermine our goals...

41:54.888 --> 41:55.923
(SIGHS)

41:56.014 --> 41:58.721
...Iike they want
us out of the way.

42:00.686 --> 42:02.096
I'm listening.

42:03.063 --> 42:04.428
What if it's Gardiner?

42:06.274 --> 42:07.434
(SCOFFS)

42:13.990 --> 42:15.491
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

42:20.706 --> 42:21.741
A toast!

42:23.166 --> 42:25.452
A toast to fear...

42:27.879 --> 42:31.121
Fear infects the minds
of our opponents.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.882
Fear slows them down

42:35.303 --> 42:39.262
and opens the door to
self-doubt and inaction.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.849
You see
without their fear,

42:42.936 --> 42:45.143
our bravery would
be meaningless.

42:46.273 --> 42:49.356
You can't fear failure
because in doing so,

42:49.860 --> 42:52.021
you are inviting failure.

42:53.655 --> 42:56.192
I think it was
TS. Eliot who said,

42:56.825 --> 43:00.283
"Only those who will
risk going too far

43:00.579 --> 43:03.992
"can possibly find out
how far one can go."

43:08.462 --> 43:09.827
Let's do this.
