You okay?
Everything all right?

00:38.500 --> 00:39.900
Mm-hmm.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.700
I just had a dream.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.100
Anything important?

00:46.300 --> 00:47.800
Hmm, I don't know.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.200
I mean, a man did die,
but it was in the hospital.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.600
I don't think there's anything
to do or anyone to call.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.200
Okay.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.900 --> 01:23.600
That's enough.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.900
That's enough.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.400
Hey.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.700
Hey, not funny.
Come on. Wake up.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.500
Come on.
Joke over.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.000
Please.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.000
Open up your eyes.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.600
I'm begging you...
just open... your eyes.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.500
Come on.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.900
Didn't we already do this?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.500
Bridge, honey,
can you turn that down?

04:25.900 --> 04:29.400
Hey, Lee, hi,this is Allison.
Can you give me a call when you get this?

04:29.400 --> 04:32.700
I had a dream last night.
I saw a young woman get,

04:32.700 --> 04:34.300
uh, "redrum"ed.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.800
Maybe it's something.
Maybe it's nothing.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.600
I don't know.
Give me a call.

04:37.800 --> 04:41.600
Yes, indeed, nothing like a little redrum
to get you going in the morning.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.900
What is redrum, Mommy?

04:43.900 --> 04:47.300
Oh, come on, everybody knows
that "redrum" is just "murder" spelled...

04:47.300 --> 04:50.400
Bridge, hey, little ears.
That's why we use code words.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.600
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.Just be careful.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.800
What's redrum?

04:55.800 --> 04:58.700
It's a kind of ice cream

04:58.700 --> 05:01.800
that the tooth fairy
gives you if you're good.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.400
Thank you.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.400
Today is an excellent day.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.900
Really? How is that possible?

05:07.900 --> 05:09.600
It's barely begun.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.600
Well, today is the day I find out

05:11.600 --> 05:14.900
who I'm having a baby 
with in wellness class.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.200
Please tell me
that's code for something.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.900
You know what I mean. 
All the sophomores have to do it.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.600
You get paired with
a "marriage partner,"

05:23.600 --> 05:26.200
and, uh, then Mr. Parks
gives us a baby

05:26.200 --> 05:28.000
and we have to take care
of it for a week.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.800
Really? A baby?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.900
It's not a real baby;
it's this expensive doll,

05:31.900 --> 05:34.200
but it's almost as real
as a real baby.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.500
They cry and coo and
burp and wet themselves.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.200
Mm, sounds like fun.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.300
It's serious.
It's ten percent of your grade,

05:42.300 --> 05:44.400
and it's just...
it'd be nice

05:44.400 --> 05:46.900
if I ended up with somebody
I kind of liked as a husband.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.600
I've always found that
to be helpful.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.300
Hey, Bridge, can you turn
that back a channel?

05:51.300 --> 05:52.400
Mm-hmm.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.300
This was the scene this morning
as Finley Park rangers discovered

05:55.300 --> 05:57.500
the bludgeoned body of a young woman,

05:57.500 --> 05:59.500
identified as Kimberly Weeks.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.200
What happened?

06:01.200 --> 06:03.900
Lady ate too much redrum.
Right, Mom?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.400
Hey, Lee.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Hey.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.500
What are you doing here?

06:15.500 --> 06:16.800
Hey, I saw you on the news.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.700
I thought I'd come by, 
maybe you'd give me an autograph.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.700
Did you get my message?
I might have dreamt about this.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.500
Young woman,
red cocktail dress?

06:24.500 --> 06:27.000
Yeah.
Don't suppose you saw who did it.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.300
Male, Caucasian,
50s-ish, nice suit,

06:30.300 --> 06:32.400
driving a luxury SUV.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.900
Wow, you got a good look
at this guy, huh?

06:33.900 --> 06:37.800
Front seat, 3:00 A.M. show.
But here's the best part.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.400
The girl scratched her killer's face
before she died-- deep gouges.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.300
I'm sure that you're going
to find a wealth of DNA

06:43.300 --> 06:44.800
under that poor girl's fingernails.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.100
I beg to differ.

06:47.100 --> 06:51.000
I don't think we're going to find
much of anything under her fingernails.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.500
Somebody removed her fingernails?

06:55.500 --> 06:57.300
Ripped 'em right out.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.900
Must have happened after he smashed her
in the head with the rock.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.400
Must have happened
after I woke up.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.700
That's why I'm always hanging around
till the credits are over.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.600
They're always putting in extra things
during the credits these days.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.400
Will you excuse me a second?

07:27.400 --> 07:29.600
Are you okay?

07:32.200 --> 07:35.800
I saw what happened to you
last night at the hospital.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.600
I'm so sorry.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.100
I can see you.

07:41.900 --> 07:44.400
I can see people like you.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.600
I really need to talk to you
about what you witnessed...

07:48.600 --> 07:50.500
here last night.

07:53.900 --> 07:58.100
Meet me over there by the bathrooms
in about five minutes.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.900
Cal Jacobs

08:01.900 --> 08:05.600
and-- let's see--
Marissa Masters.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.700
You are the proud parents
of a baby girl.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.600
Hey, Ash, who's left other
than Adam and Marcos?

08:16.800 --> 08:20.600
We're not out of the woods yet.
We've still got the Unabomber.

08:21.400 --> 08:26.000
Jack White...
and Ashley Whitaker.

08:26.900 --> 08:30.000
I am so sorry.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Adam Mankowicz
and Ariel Dubois.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.300
Thanks.

08:51.100 --> 08:53.200
Ah, look what we made,
Mrs. Mankowicz.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.900
Yeah.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.600
Um, so I'll take the first shift.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.900
I got an away game on Tuesday.
Can you take her for the next two nights?

09:03.900 --> 09:05.000
Sure.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.500
Sweet.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.800
I'll call you.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.300
If you were anyone else,
I'd have you arrested for intent to solicit.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.400
You've been standing outside this men's room
for the past 20 minutes.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.700
What can I say?
Times are tough.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.500
I saw someone in the crowd
that I knew,

09:25.500 --> 09:28.900
and I thought we were going to meet up here
after I was done, but...

09:29.000 --> 09:32.600
Well, we're about to wrap it up across 
the street, so I'm gonna take off.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.000
If you want to meet me
back at the station,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.900
we can work up a sketch
of the killer you saw in your dream.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.200
Unless you got
other business here.

09:39.700 --> 09:43.100
- Funny-- you're funny, funny, funny.
- We aim to please.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.900
Okay, girls are down.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.600
Well, two out of three.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.100
Who's the holdout?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.600
The one busy writing
"Mrs. Ariel Mankowicz" 

09:51.600 --> 09:55.300
on every available inch of 
her notebook.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.100
The good news is
she's considering hyphenating.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.900
I'm trying to steer her
towards Dubois-Mankowicz

10:00.900 --> 10:04.000
over the less husband-friendly
Mankowicz-Dubois.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.800
What you looking at?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.200
Mug books.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.900
Trying to see
if there's anyone in here

10:08.900 --> 10:11.900
who even looks vaguely similar
to the man I saw 

10:11.900 --> 10:13.800
kill that girl last night.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.400
Oh, yeah,
any luck?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.000
Nope, it was a long shot.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.200
The man in my dream
wasn't a career criminal.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.200
He looked like an executive
or a lawyer

10:23.200 --> 10:25.600
or some successful businessman.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.400
What I can't figure out is

10:27.400 --> 10:29.400
why that ghost didn't help me.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.700
He saw everything.

10:30.700 --> 10:34.000
I know.
Would it have killed him to talk to you?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.400
Not funny.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.300
I put today's mail
on your desk, sir.

10:46.300 --> 10:49.300
Fine. Hold all my calls.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.000
Yes?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.400
You make it to work okay this morning?

11:18.400 --> 11:20.100
Excuse me?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.100
May I ask who's calling?

11:23.100 --> 11:26.600
You were a busy boy last night.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.100
I'm... I'm sorry.
Who-Who am I talking to?

11:29.100 --> 11:30.600
Someone who knows everything

11:30.600 --> 11:34.700
about the last two minutes
of poor Kimberly Weeks' life.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.600
That was her real name,
you know.

11:36.600 --> 11:40.700
Or maybe you didn't, but I do.
I know everything:

11:40.700 --> 11:45.600
how it went from playful
to really, really rough.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.800
- What do you want?
- $500,000.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.400
I-I... I don't... I don't have
that-that kind of money.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.700
Oh, I bet
you can get your hands on it.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.300
And that's why I sent you
a little incentive.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.400
Do you see a brown paper package
lying on your desk?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.400
Yes.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.100
Go on. Open it.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.400
Take a look inside.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
Oh! Oh, my...

12:16.200 --> 12:18.700
First one's on the house...

12:23.700 --> 12:25.900
So in addition
to looking for a killer,

12:25.900 --> 12:28.800
we're now supposed to be looking for someone
who's blackmailing the killer?

12:28.800 --> 12:30.700
One fingernail at a time.

12:30.700 --> 12:33.800
Hey, if we can't keep the world
safe for murderers...

12:34.500 --> 12:38.100
Any clue as to the, uh,
identity of this woman?

12:38.100 --> 12:41.100
No. I didn't see her face.
I only heard her voice.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.600
But she knew everything
about the killer.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.600
And clearly, he didn't
know anything about her.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.300
Maybe it was someone
she worked with.

12:46.300 --> 12:49.400
Worked? I thought she was a
student at Mesa University.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.500
Yeah. Well, we have reason
to believe that what you witnessed

12:52.500 --> 12:54.900
wasn't just the end
of a date gone wrong.

12:54.900 --> 12:58.100
It appears
Kimberly helped pay her tuition by, uh, 

12:58.200 --> 13:01.800
entertaining men.
Nights. Weekends.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.200
Uh-huh.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.700
We're following up some leads.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.000
Looking at her computer
and cell phone.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.200
Trying to see if anybody matches
the description of that businessman.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.300
Well, whoever this blackmailer is,
one thing seems pretty clear.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.400
She was a witness
to Kimberly's murder.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.800
So, if Allison's dream is accurate,
she knows how to contact the killer.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.200
Sounds like if we find her,
we can find him.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.500
Looks like you survived
your first night.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.600
- Yeah. Sorry about all the phone calls.
- No. It's, uh... it's okay.

13:33.900 --> 13:37.100
This baby should really come with a Get Out of
 Trig Test Free or something.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.700
I don't know how I gonna stay
awake for my next exam.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.300
She woke me up
four times last night.

13:42.300 --> 13:45.000
Hmm. Well, I don't know.
You look pretty comfortable with her.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.300
Yeah, well, it's kind of
like holding a football.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.600
Well, you can pass
her to me now.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.000
Are you all right?

14:07.500 --> 14:10.200
I feel really great.
Just a little dizzy.

14:10.200 --> 14:15.000
But, uh, maybe you can
just put her in here.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.200
Yeah, all right.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.600
You should have seen the look
on their faces when I told them 

14:20.600 --> 14:24.200
we needed to be looking
for a blackmailer and a killer.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.000
Oh, that brings
back memories.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.800
- Ariel, tend to your child.
- She can't hear you.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.600
- I can't hear me. Ariel?!
- Hey!

14:33.600 --> 14:35.900
Ariel!

14:36.800 --> 14:41.200
I sang to her, I told her some jokes,
but she's still crying.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.300
Bridgette, don't play with that.
That's Ariel's wellness project.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.200
But I'm baby-sitting.
Ariel's paying me a dollar an hour.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.500
She's paying you to do her homework?

14:50.500 --> 14:52.400
All right.
You take that baby back to Ariel,

14:52.400 --> 14:54.500
and you tell her
that your shift is over.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.100
And if she can't stop her child
from crying,

14:56.100 --> 14:58.100
I'm gonna call social services
on her.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.800
But I still got my dollar, right?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.000
Who am I talking to?

15:02.000 --> 15:07.400
Someone who knows about the last two minutes
of poor Kimberly Weeks' life.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.800
That was her real name,
you know.

15:08.800 --> 15:14.200
Or maybe you didn't, but I do.
I know everything 

15:14.200 --> 15:15.900
where you took her;

15:15.900 --> 15:19.000
how it went
from playful to rough

15:19.000 --> 15:21.900
to really, really rough.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.100
What-What do you want?

15:23.100 --> 15:24.800
$500,000.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.100
I don't... I don't have
that kind of money.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.400
Oh, I bet you can get your hands
 on it.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.400
That's why I sent you 
a little incentive.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.900
Do you, uh, see a brown paper package
 lying on your desk?

15:35.900 --> 15:37.100
Yes.

15:37.100 --> 15:41.900
Go on. Open it.
Take a look inside.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.700
Oh. Oh, my...

15:46.700 --> 15:49.000
First one's on the house.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.300
The other nine are gonna cost you.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.800
Ariel?!

16:05.500 --> 16:07.800
Ariel!

16:09.100 --> 16:13.100
Suddenly, I'm not looking
forward to being a grandfather.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.600
Nope. I'm not there.
I somehow managed to survive the night.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.000
Mm.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.200
What are you doing up, huh?

16:25.200 --> 16:28.700
It's barely 6:30. You're all dressed;
you're ready for work.

16:28.700 --> 16:32.300
I couldn't sleep. I decided I'd come out here
and try to find my ghost.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.200
The one I keep seeing
in my dreams.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.800
First he's on hand
to witness a murder.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.000
The next day,
he's at the crime scene.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Now, according to my dream last night,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.500
he's spending time with the blackmailer,

16:43.500 --> 16:46.200
listening in on her phone calls.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.800
What are you saying?
That he's following the same case you are?

16:48.800 --> 16:52.100
Well, it seems that way.
All the more reason for me to try to find him.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.700
Clearly, this guy knows more
about this whole thing than I do.

16:54.700 --> 16:58.700
So, what are you looking at?
I mean, how do you track a ghost, exactly?

16:58.700 --> 17:01.400
Is there some kind of secret Web site?

17:01.800 --> 17:03.200
Nah.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.500
Look, according to my dream,

17:04.500 --> 17:06.800
he died the same night
that girl Kimberly did.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.599
Oh.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.700
So I've been looking
through the obituaries

17:09.700 --> 17:12.700
for last night and today,
but I'm not finding anything.

17:12.700 --> 17:16.599
Maybe you're going at it
from the other direction.

17:18.599 --> 17:19.800
Meaning?

17:19.800 --> 17:24.200
Well, you know, when old Mrs.
 What's-Her-Name down the street died...

17:24.400 --> 17:26.700
...it took her husband, like,
three weeks after the funeral

17:26.700 --> 17:29.400
to get around to putting 
an obit in the paper.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.000
The obituary writer is, like,
the last guy to know when someone dies.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.100
You need to find the first guy.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.700
You're right.

17:38.700 --> 17:42.700
White Peaks Regional Hospital.
May I put you on hold for just one moment?

17:43.700 --> 17:48.000
I'm sorry. We can't release a patient's 
personal health information without a court order.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.600
I understand. Really,
I do, and as I told you,

17:50.600 --> 17:52.100
I work for the District
Attorney's office,

17:52.100 --> 17:55.400
and I'm not asking for
any personal information.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.000
I just wanted to know if a man

17:57.000 --> 17:58.900
matching the description
I gave you died here,

17:58.900 --> 18:03.100
and if he did,
what his name is.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Please. It pertains to 
the murder of a young woman.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.200
You say he was Caucasian?

18:14.300 --> 18:16.100
Around 30?

18:18.700 --> 18:20.500
Well...

18:20.600 --> 18:24.300
if I could tell you
what you want me to tell you,

18:24.300 --> 18:27.200
I wouldn't have anything
to tell you.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.600
Mind if I have a seat?

18:52.500 --> 18:55.600
Is that your wife and daughter?

18:56.300 --> 18:59.500
They must miss you terribly.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.800
Listen, who... who are you,
and-and what do you want?

19:04.800 --> 19:08.200
I told you what I wanted
that day in the park.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.600
I want to know what you know
about the murder of Kimberly Weeks.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.300
I know you saw the whole thing.

19:14.300 --> 19:17.200
I... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.200
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.700
You were there the
night that she died.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.500
You were there the next
day at the crime scene.

19:24.500 --> 19:28.700
And then you listened in while a woman 
tried to blackmail the murderer.

19:28.900 --> 19:33.400
Listen, I know you are going
 through a terribly difficult time,

19:33.600 --> 19:35.800
trying to deal with your mortality;

19:35.800 --> 19:39.200
to make peace with the fact
that your life is over.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.900
It's a huge adjustment.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.400
But I really need your help.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.700
- Did you see me, Daddy?
- Yeah.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.300
- Did you see me?
- Yes, I saw you, sweetheart.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.800
Now, come on. Go grab Mommy.
It's almost time to go.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.800
Yeah.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.400
Look, uh, I don't know
who you are

19:56.400 --> 19:59.100
or what you think you know,
uh, but, uh,

19:59.100 --> 20:00.900
I have surgery in 20 minutes,

20:00.900 --> 20:05.000
so I'd appreciate it????

20:09.700 --> 20:12.700
So let me see if I understand this.
This looks exactly like the woman

20:12.700 --> 20:15.700
you saw blackmailing
Kimberly Weeks' killer,

20:15.700 --> 20:19.900
- but you don't want us to distribute it?
-That's right.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.000
Any particular reason?

20:22.000 --> 20:26.100
I guess I'm just not certain of the accuracy of 
my dreams pertaining to this case.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.000
The-The description I gave you
of that woman--

20:28.000 --> 20:30.400
I'm not sure I can stand behind it.

20:30.400 --> 20:34.200
Am I allowed to ask what triggered 
this crisis in confidence?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.400
It's a long story.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.400
In my dreams,
I saw someone, a ghost,

20:39.400 --> 20:42.000
who witnessed both the murder
and the blackmail.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
A ghost?

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
He died of cardiac arrest a few minutes
before Kimberly found herself in the car with her killer.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.400
And I've been searching
for him, this-this ghost,

20:51.400 --> 20:55.500
ever since that night to see 
what he knows, to see what he saw.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.700
And I actually found him this morning.
The problem is,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.500
he's about as far from dead
as you can possibly get.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.700
He's actually alive and well
and living in Scottsdale.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.600
-The ghost?
- His name is Dr. Brian Seward.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.600
He's a surgeon at White Peaks
Regional Hospital.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.500
Obviously, he's not dead.
Obviously, he didn't see anything.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.500
Which makes me wonder
if any of the things I saw,

21:17.500 --> 21:22.400
or any of the things that I dreamt 
actually happened the way that I saw them.

21:23.900 --> 21:28.200
Hey, Ariel, I'm on a work call here.
Can you please take care of that baby?

21:29.000 --> 21:32.200
Mitch, hold on one second, will you?
Allison?!

21:32.200 --> 21:36.800
I'm giving Marie a bath. 
Ariel?!

21:37.000 --> 21:39.600
- Bridgette!
- I don't have it.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.000
And Ariel's in her room
with the door shut.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.300
Look, sorry, Mitch.
Can I call you right back?

21:46.300 --> 21:47.400
Thanks.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.800
Ariel!

21:53.400 --> 21:55.300
Ariel!

21:56.400 --> 21:57.800
Hey.

21:59.300 --> 22:00.700
Yeah, Dad?

22:00.700 --> 22:03.000
Do you not hear this?

22:03.200 --> 22:04.400
Sorry, Dad.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.800
"Sorry, Dad"?
Is that the best you can do?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.900
You need to do a better job
of taking care of that baby, young lady.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.700
That is your assignment.
That's not your mother's.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.000
It's not your sister's.
It's not mine. It's yours.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.800
No. I know.
I just, uh, I don't know.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.900
I don't really want to move.
I don't want to think.

22:18.900 --> 22:23.000
I just want to lay down
and listen to music.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.100
What's going on with you?
You feeling all right?

22:25.100 --> 22:29.400
No... I feel really good.
I just... kinda hungry.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.200
But really good.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.400
Sorry about the crying.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.700
Do you think Mom bought chips?

22:39.700 --> 22:41.300
If she weren't our daughter,

22:41.300 --> 22:43.300
I would have sworn
she was high as a kite.

22:43.300 --> 22:46.200
- Don't say that.
- Hey, I'm just telling you what I saw.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.400
She even went looking for munchies.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.900
- Did somebody scream?
- Hey, you all right? What's going on?

22:52.900 --> 22:56.100
There was a man in the house.
He was standing right there.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.000
- What?
- What are you talking about?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.100
I was, um, I was feeding the baby,

23:00.100 --> 23:02.500
and-and I got hungry so I went
for a snack and then I came back

23:02.500 --> 23:06.000
and saw him standing right there,
 listening to what you guys were saying.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.600
He was outside our door?

23:07.600 --> 23:11.000
- Sweetie, there's no one here.
- I screamed and he disappeared.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.400
- Where did he go?
- I don't know!

23:13.400 --> 23:15.400
He was there,
and then he was gone.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.000
Okay, I'm going to go check the house.
You, you stand over there.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.500
Be careful, Joe. Here.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.600
- Okay, well, I don't understand.
- Did he say anything?

23:24.600 --> 23:26.000
What did he look like?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.400
He didn't look like anything.
He was just standing there

23:28.400 --> 23:31.500
listening to what you
and Daddy were saying.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.100
I don't know.
He had, um,

23:33.100 --> 23:35.600
sandy hair and, uh,
wearing a white coat.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.800
Wait, wait, a white coat
like a doctor's coat?

23:39.700 --> 23:42.800
I checked inside.
I checked outside. Nothing.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.300
This house is sealed up
tight as a drum.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.600
I don't know what to tell you.

23:48.300 --> 23:52.000
I thought this bed would be wall-to-wall girls
by the time I climbed back into it.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.800
Everyone's in their rooms.
Everyone's in their beds.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.700
I'm concerned about Ariel.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.700
I'm telling you something's not right.
She's acting very strangely.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.200
All this snacking?  And now 
she's seeing people who aren't there.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.900
I don't know about that seeing people
that aren't there part.

24:06.900 --> 24:10.000
I mean, the man that she described
sounded an awful lot like

24:10.000 --> 24:12.900
that Dr. Brian Seward
I spoke with today.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.800
The living dead guy?

24:14.800 --> 24:18.700
Allison, come on, I just checked
every window and every door.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.800
No human being could get in here.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.300
Well, what about a ghost?

24:22.300 --> 24:24.700
Honestly, honey,
he's not a ghost.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.900
Come on, you just said yourself
you saw him today,

24:26.900 --> 24:28.700
interacting with his kid.

24:28.700 --> 24:32.100
Didn't you say he's a,
like a registered surgeon at that hospital?

24:32.100 --> 24:33.000
Yes.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.300
Okay, so either he's alive
and running around playing with his kids,

24:36.300 --> 24:39.600
or he's dead and... and scaring
the heck out of mine,

24:39.600 --> 24:41.900
but he can't be both. Right?

24:41.900 --> 24:43.000
Right.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.900
Just do me a favor.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.300
Just keep an eye
on Ariel tomorrow.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.300
And then when I get home,
we'll compare notes, okay?

24:49.300 --> 24:50.900
Of course.

25:42.600 --> 25:46.100
Okay, Victoria. It's time.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.800
You okay?

26:03.800 --> 26:06.700
Yeah, I'm okay.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.600
Victoria.

26:09.900 --> 26:12.400
That was a close one.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.400
Just tell me you saw
something good.

26:18.300 --> 26:22.600
Someone really rich doing
something really bad?

26:23.000 --> 26:26.600
Actually,
I didn't just see something good.

26:27.700 --> 26:30.400
I saw a gold mine.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.200
You were at my house
last night, weren't you?

26:40.200 --> 26:42.100
Don't even bother denying it.

26:42.100 --> 26:46.600
I think I know what you're up to, Dr. Seward,
and I'm not going to let you get away with it.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.300
Okay.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.200
Exactly what have I been up to?

26:55.200 --> 26:58.000
I-I don't know what kind of weird
adrenaline junkie you are.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.800
I don't know how you
figured out how to do it,

27:00.800 --> 27:02.700
but you're killing yourself
a little bit,

27:02.700 --> 27:06.200
making yourself into a ghost
so you can see people's secrets,

27:06.200 --> 27:10.800
and then you bring yourself back to life
so you and your partner can blackmail them.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.000
Wow.

27:13.500 --> 27:17.300
You, you actually said that
out loud in front of an adult.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.400
I admire your courage.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.200
But you must know
how absurd that sounds.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.600
Well, don't worry about it.
I don't have to prove the "absurd" part.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.100
I just have to prove
that you're a blackmailer.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.400
And it's only a matter
of time until I do.

27:29.400 --> 27:34.000
And in the meantime,
stay away from my house.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.500
Stay away from my family.
Stay away from me.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.600
You know, it's not what you think.

27:42.800 --> 27:46.700
I'm not some greedy,
thrill-seeking bastard.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.600
I'm dying.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.200
You see this oval here?

27:53.200 --> 27:55.200
That's a tumor.

27:55.500 --> 27:59.800
Apparently, it's been growing in my brain
for at least five years.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.700
Yeah, I had no idea.

28:01.700 --> 28:04.000
I mean, I used to get headaches,
but who doesn't?

28:05.200 --> 28:07.600
And then, one day last September, um,

28:08.100 --> 28:10.900
I just collapsed.

28:11.100 --> 28:14.500
I was clinically dead
for almost three minutes.

28:14.900 --> 28:19.600
And I remembered every moment of it.

28:19.600 --> 28:24.200
I could choose to be anywhere,
watch anything, anyone I wanted to see,

28:24.200 --> 28:27.100
and they couldn't see me.

28:27.600 --> 28:31.400
And just as I was getting
the hang of it, I was back.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.500
They shocked my heart,
and I was back.

28:35.100 --> 28:37.600
That's when I got the good news.

28:37.600 --> 28:41.200
18 months to live.
Two years tops.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.400
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, you and me both.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.200
Look...

28:47.900 --> 28:50.100
I'm only a resident.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.400
Okay, I drop dead tomorrow,
no medical bills,

28:52.400 --> 28:56.600
I will still leave my wife
with a hundred thousand dollars

28:56.600 --> 28:58.800
of med school tuition I owe,

28:58.800 --> 29:03.000
not to mention the mortgage,
my daughter's school.

29:04.200 --> 29:07.300
I mean, come on.
It's kind of genius.

29:07.300 --> 29:10.900
You stop the heart
with a few ccs of diazepam.

29:10.900 --> 29:14.500
You get a whole three minutes
before brain damage sets in.

29:15.100 --> 29:18.700
After that, it's just CPR 101.

29:18.700 --> 29:23.000
Every ambulance driver in the country is
 trained on how to bring the dead back to life.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.600
You think it's depraved, don't you?

29:26.600 --> 29:29.400
Well, I think
there has to be another way.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.500
What you're doing is illegal.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.400
And it's dangerous.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.300
What if you don't make it back next time?
Where does that leave your wife and daughter?

29:37.300 --> 29:40.000
You don't understand.
I don't have a choice.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.200
no,You don't understand.
 there is no choice.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.700
I will bring a case against you.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.700
Even if you're right,
even if I can't prove it,

29:46.700 --> 29:50.700
is that really how you want to spend
this little bit of time you have left--

29:50.700 --> 29:55.600
putting your family through the stress
and the expense of a trial?

29:56.500 --> 29:58.500
So what exactly is it that you want?

29:58.500 --> 30:00.400
I want you to stop.

30:00.400 --> 30:05.500
I want you to give me the name of 
the man who murdered Kimberly Weeks.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.100
And in return?

30:08.100 --> 30:10.500
In return, this conversation

30:10.500 --> 30:14.000
will stay in this room.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.900
Okay, I'll tell you what.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.400
I'll throw in the nine bloody fingernails

30:22.400 --> 30:24.300
that will prove that the man
whose name I'm going to give you

30:24.300 --> 30:29.000
is the one who killed her
in exchange for your word.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.200
My word?

30:30.200 --> 30:32.800
That the man isn't arrested
until after 5:00 today.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.800
Why? Are you and your partner
getting paid off at 4:59?

30:35.800 --> 30:38.500
Do we have a deal?

30:38.500 --> 30:40.700
What if I say no?

30:40.700 --> 30:43.700
I might just forget the man's name.

30:43.900 --> 30:46.700
I might just lose those fingernails.

30:47.600 --> 30:52.200
I have something at stake.
You have something at stake.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.200
That's why they call it a deal.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Sorry.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.300
I don't know what happened to me yesterday.
I was like a dead person.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.500
Yeah, I noticed.

31:08.400 --> 31:12.400
Totally spaced. I couldn't do 
a thing but lay on my bed.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.400
And then when I saw
the dead guy, I couldn't sleep.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.200
So I had to wake up this morning 
at 4:30 to do my homework.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.600
But you're feeling all right now?

31:20.600 --> 31:25.000
No, I'm fine. I'm just, uh, 
a little tired,  but fine.

31:32.900 --> 31:35.500
Oh, look, uh, there's Adam.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.200
Great. I can, uh... it's his turn.
So I can give him the baby now.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.700
Okay.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.400
Good driving, sweetie.
Now you have a great day.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.700
Mom will pick you up
this afternoon.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.500
Whoa.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.700
You okay?

31:59.700 --> 32:04.200
No, I just... everything's kind
of starting to spin.

32:04.500 --> 32:09.400
- Ariel?
- Gee, I could really go for a cookie.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.700
Ariel, look at you.

32:11.700 --> 32:14.800
I don't really think I can do that.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.200
Give me that doll.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.300
That was weird.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.000
You feel okay now?

32:26.600 --> 32:27.800
Yeah.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.400
What are you doing?

32:32.400 --> 32:34.400
I don't know. It seemed like
that when the doll was in the back seat,

32:34.400 --> 32:36.400
you were fine, and then as soon
as you got close to it...

32:36.400 --> 32:38.600
But I don't smell anything.

32:38.600 --> 32:42.600
Here, give me the doll. I'll give it
 to Adam before the bell rings.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.000
Hey, you know what?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.700
You go ahead to class.
I'll give the doll to Adam.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.900
But... Dad, I mean,
what if the teacher sees?

32:51.900 --> 32:54.100
The teacher's not going to see.
You go ahead.You go to class.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.400
- Let me give the doll to Adam.
- Dad...

32:56.400 --> 32:59.300
Ariel, I'll give the doll
to Adam.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.700
Hey, Adam
Adam Mankowicz?

33:04.700 --> 33:07.400
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.300
I guess you could say
that I'm your father-in-law.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.200
Joe Dubois.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.500
Ariel's father.
Nice to meet you, sir.

33:14.500 --> 33:18.200
- Special delivery.
- Thank you.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.600
You gonna be okay
looking after her?

33:21.600 --> 33:24.400
Your eyes look a little red.

33:25.900 --> 33:29.000
No, sir. I'm fine.
I... I have allergies.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.100
-Really?
- Yeah.

33:31.100 --> 33:34.100
How often do you get these allergies?

33:34.100 --> 33:36.800
I mean, are we talking every night?

33:36.800 --> 33:38.700
After school?

33:38.700 --> 33:41.300
Before school?

33:41.300 --> 33:44.300
How about at night, 
when your parents aren't home?

33:44.300 --> 33:45.800
I really need to go.

33:45.800 --> 33:50.000
Do your parents even know
about these allergies? Hmm?

33:50.300 --> 33:53.700
No, I didn't think so.
So let me ask you something.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.400
The other night, when it was 
your turn to take care of the baby,

33:56.400 --> 33:59.100
did you have allergies then?

33:59.100 --> 34:00.500
I might have. 

34:00.500 --> 34:03.700
Well, guess what, son?
You're getting a divorce.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.700
- What?
- That's right.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.300
And you've won sole custody
of that baby.

34:08.300 --> 34:11.300
You're gonna raise her on your own
from now until the end of the assignment.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.600
Wait. No, no, no.
That's not fair,

34:12.600 --> 34:14.800
because me and Ariel are supposed 
to finish this project together.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.900
Right. Adam, you wouldn't want
me to have to tell your parents

34:17.900 --> 34:21.000
about these allergies of yours, would you?

34:21.900 --> 34:24.000
You can't do that;
that's blackmail.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.199
Maybe you'd like to take this up
with your ex mother-in-law,

34:26.199 --> 34:29.000
who works for Phoenix Police Department?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.600
- No, sir.
- Then we understand each other?

34:33.199 --> 34:34.699
Oh, and, Adam,

34:34.699 --> 34:38.199
if I ever get the sense that you've given
 my daughter your allergies,

34:38.199 --> 34:39.600
I know where to find you.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.699
Local attorney Patrick Davidson
was arrested today

34:43.699 --> 34:47.800
for the murder
of Mesa University student Kimberly Weeks.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.600
Police say that an anonymous tip
led them to the discovery

34:50.600 --> 34:52.500
of nine of the victims' fingernails,

34:52.500 --> 34:55.600
which were apparently removed
shortly after the murder.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.700
The fingernails, all of them
covered with the lawyer's DNA,

34:58.700 --> 35:00.500
helped seal the case
against Davidson...

35:00.500 --> 35:02.800
- Good.
- Good for you.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.900
Well, good for everybody, I hope.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.600
What is that supposed to mean?

35:06.600 --> 35:08.900
Well, I don't know.
I just don't feel right about Dr. Seward

35:08.900 --> 35:12.800
just walking away from this whole thing with 
a half a million dollars of ill-gotten gains.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.300
It's for his family.

35:14.300 --> 35:17.800
I know, that's what I keep
telling myself.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.800
But we-we can't stop.
Not now.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.900
Well, I-I... I don't know
what to tell you, Vic.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.700
Tell me, you'll do it again.

35:25.700 --> 35:28.500
At least one more time. After that,

35:28.500 --> 35:31.100
if you want to walk away...

35:32.900 --> 35:35.400
Think of your family, Brian.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.800
A quarter of a million dollars
is nothing.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.800
Once you're gone, what do you suppose
they're going to live on?

35:41.800 --> 35:44.800
You don't understand;
I don't have a choice. Okay?

35:44.800 --> 35:46.300
That woman from the DA's office...

35:46.300 --> 35:51.500
What about her?
Does she have a badge? A gun?

35:51.500 --> 35:54.700
She's just a fortune-teller, Brian.

35:54.700 --> 35:58.900
She can't tell anyone about us.
No one would believe her.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.500
Look, I...

36:00.500 --> 36:03.000
We ended up on her radar

36:03.000 --> 36:04.900
because the man
we were blackmailing

36:04.900 --> 36:08.200
was the #1 suspect
in a murder investigation.

36:08.200 --> 36:12.800
From now on, we just pick someone 
who is of no interest to the DA's office--

36:12.800 --> 36:17.300
some rich guy,
cheating on his wife.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.800
She'll never even know.

36:49.800 --> 36:53.100
10:17...

36:53.100 --> 36:55.600
Mrs. James Richardson,

36:55.600 --> 37:00.500
do you know where your beloved husband is?
I'm betting you don't.

37:03.500 --> 37:07.500
Good thing you're a banker, pal.
It's going to cost you.

37:11.200 --> 37:15.200
Okay, Victoria,
hit me with the paddles.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.600
I'm running out of time.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.300
Oh, no...

38:26.600 --> 38:28.400
Hello?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.200
Anybody here?

38:30.500 --> 38:31.700
Victoria.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.300
Hi. I'm Allison.
I'm Allison Dubois.

38:34.300 --> 38:37.600
I don't think we've officially met,
but I think you know about me.

38:37.600 --> 38:41.300
I'm the fortune-teller--
the one with no badge or no gun.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.700
Please, have a seat.
I ordered you something.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.100
What do you mean,
you ordered me something?

38:50.100 --> 38:52.800
I didn't even know I was going
to stop in here until a minute ago.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.100
Oh, but Brian did; he's the one
who told me you'd be coming.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.000
Please, sit.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.600
Well, he wanted me to say "hi" to you.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.500
Brian, I mean.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.700
We had a little talk
right after you murdered him.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.300
I'm sorry...

39:12.300 --> 39:15.200
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

39:15.200 --> 39:18.700
and if you mean Dr. Brian Seward,

39:18.700 --> 39:22.000
I understand that he committed suicide.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.500
Yeah, you went to a lot of trouble to make it 
look like a suicide. And you know what?

39:26.600 --> 39:29.100
You did a great job.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.200
The truth is, the police,
the district attorney,

39:31.200 --> 39:34.400
they're never gonna be able
to get you for his murder.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.000
You're not drinking your ice tea.
Do you want me to order you something else?

39:37.000 --> 39:38.900
I'm fine.

39:38.900 --> 39:40.100
Anyway, put your mind at ease.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.400
The whole murder thing,
it isn't gonna happen.

39:42.400 --> 39:45.100
You completely outsmarted us.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.200
Okay?

39:48.200 --> 39:50.300
Anyway, that's not what you need
to be concerned about.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.300
What you need to be concerned
about is...

39:52.300 --> 39:54.200
now that Brian is dead, I mean...

39:54.200 --> 39:57.100
full-time dead,
you would be shocked

39:57.100 --> 40:00.100
by the things he can actually
see where he is.

40:00.100 --> 40:03.900
I mean, for instance, not only did he know
 you were gonna stop in this little diner,

40:03.900 --> 40:06.500
but he knew you were making
your way over the border,

40:06.500 --> 40:11.300
to take that $500,000 you stole
and put it in a Mexican bank.

40:11.300 --> 40:14.500
He also knew that you had the money
in the trunk of your car...

40:14.500 --> 40:17.600
in cash,
under an old Indian blanket,

40:17.600 --> 40:21.900
and that you kept a spare key
in a magnetized box in your wheel well.

40:21.900 --> 40:25.600
You know, I went and had a little visit
with Brian's wife today.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.900
It was a pretty tricky conversation,
but it really helped to have Brian

40:28.900 --> 40:32.100
right there, by my side,
 while I explained everything to her.

40:32.100 --> 40:35.100
She was really interested
in what I had to say.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.200
And it took a little doing,
but eventually I convinced her

40:38.200 --> 40:42.200
to leave Katie with the baby sitter
and take a little drive out here.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.500
No, she's not here now.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.900
That was probably her just leaving.

40:55.300 --> 40:58.800
You know, what you're doing
is a really good thing.

40:58.900 --> 41:03.800
Now Brian's wife is gonna have the money
to bury the father of her child.

41:03.800 --> 41:07.200
She'll be able to pay off
his medical school bills,

41:07.200 --> 41:10.000
put their little girl through college...

41:10.000 --> 41:11.500
live a better life.

41:11.500 --> 41:15.000
Oh, um, if you get any ideas
about trying to get that money back,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.100
you should just swallow them.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.500
Brian wanted me to let you know  that, uh,

41:19.600 --> 41:24.200
he'll be watching you, always.
And he's got my number.

41:24.500 --> 41:27.800
I know you're a little tight
on cash right now, so...

41:27.800 --> 41:31.600
that ice tea-- it's on me.
