No,thank you.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.640
Hey.Have you heard about bart?

01:04.810 --> 01:05.740
I did.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.840
Wow.Is there anything I can do?

01:07.950 --> 01:10.160
Tom,there's been a
developmentwith a past donor.

01:10.180 --> 01:11.010
Development?

01:11.170 --> 01:13.290
I don't want to talk
tonathaniel about it,not today,

01:13.410 --> 01:16.250
but there'sbeen a terrible development.

01:41.190 --> 01:45.000
Dr. Jacobs has passed.Give
his family some time.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.160
Sorry. I didn't want youto be called in.

02:07.180 --> 02:07.870
What is it?

02:08.009 --> 02:09.789
We wouldn't have paged
you,but we have a huge problem.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.130
Just tell mewhat happened.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.000
The liver recipient,george nedved.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.870
Right,abnormal tissue.We
biopsied yesterday.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.030
His test
resultscame back --

02:17.160 --> 02:19.520
malignant breast cancerin his liver.

02:19.620 --> 02:21.310
Breast cancer?

02:22.370 --> 02:25.300
The dna showsthat
it's from female cells.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.280
His donor gave himbreast cancer?

02:31.730 --> 02:33.360
Damn it,kate.

02:33.490 --> 02:34.500
Her namewas elizabeth morton.

02:34.630 --> 02:37.830
She was 34 years old,seemingly
in perfect health.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.140
It was microscopicbreast cancer.

02:40.270 --> 02:43.960
It didn't show up on any
ofour scans,but we did miss it.

02:44.350 --> 02:46.620
How many other organsdid
we take from ms. Morton?

02:47.690 --> 02:49.830
- SiX.
- Six?

02:50.630 --> 02:52.510
You've givenpotentially cancerous organs

02:52.620 --> 02:54.580
to six patients?

02:59.110 --> 03:01.180
Hey,I'm really sorryabout bart.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.140
Thank you,mary.

03:02.260 --> 03:03.660
What did youtell the recipients?

03:03.800 --> 03:06.000
That theremay have
been some complications

03:06.130 --> 03:07.450
and that we need them
to comein for tests.

03:07.570 --> 03:09.310
- You found them all?
- All of ours.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.600
If nedved has cancer,won't
they all have cancer?

03:11.730 --> 03:13.250
We'll do the tests,and
we'll see what comes back.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.930
But if nedved has
it,won't they all have it?

03:31.260 --> 03:33.010
We're going to admit
you and run some tests --

03:33.150 --> 03:36.810
a ct scan,a biopsy of your
lungs and lymph nodes to see

03:37.290 --> 03:40.550
if there are any abnormal
cancerous tissues.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.110
Alice?

03:43.220 --> 03:44.920
But I feel fine.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.090
In fact,for the first time in my life,

03:47.220 --> 03:48.960
I feel more than fine.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.190
Well,I'm glad to hear that.

03:50.490 --> 03:53.380
No more oxygen.I can walk up stairs.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.690
And I can sing again.

03:55.810 --> 03:56.970
There's a chance that
the cancer's already

03:57.100 --> 03:58.660
spread to your donor's lungs,

03:59.070 --> 04:00.340
so we have to move quickly.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.140
I'm fine,dr. Grant.

04:03.270 --> 04:05.370
Alice,I know this is hard to understand,

04:05.490 --> 04:07.220
but this situation is very real.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.000
The situation is I'm fine.

04:10.110 --> 04:12.600
I feel fine.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.740
Mr. Moody,please come in.

04:22.390 --> 04:23.730
What's this all about?

04:23.870 --> 04:26.100
Why don't you come in
and have a seat,please?

04:29.070 --> 04:30.510
Why am I back here?

04:32.140 --> 04:34.850
I'm afraid there's been a
complication with your donor.

04:39.150 --> 04:41.670
Because it's bull,teddy.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.960
Just get me the organ.

04:43.080 --> 04:43.920
Demand it.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.990
Or do I need to come down there myself?

04:50.810 --> 04:52.230
Kate,

04:52.490 --> 04:54.340
this is not your fault,okay?

04:54.460 --> 04:56.050
It's not your
mistake.This stuff happens.

04:56.190 --> 04:57.800
Tom,you know full well

04:57.920 --> 04:59.440
that I am partly to blame.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.750
May I have everyone's attention,please?

05:03.360 --> 05:05.610
For those of you who don't already know,

05:05.740 --> 05:08.270
dr. Bart jacobs passed this morning.

05:09.060 --> 05:12.690
Now,in regard to our
current situation,dr. Jonas,

05:13.090 --> 05:14.640
you will oversee mr. Moody's kidney

05:14.770 --> 05:17.170
and pancreas testing and
mrs. Fogerty's heart tests.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.810
Okay.

05:18.940 --> 05:20.010
But you're taking the lung

05:20.140 --> 05:21.100
and the liver?

05:21.220 --> 05:22.190
Right.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.900
But if o'connell and nedved have cancer,

05:25.020 --> 05:26.930
they have nearly no chance for survival.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.690
Which is why I need to handle them.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.860
It would be best if I help you out.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.550
I appreciate your concern,

05:32.660 --> 05:35.320
but they're my patients,and
they deserve my attention.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.930
I found a liver donor for mr. Nedved.

05:37.050 --> 05:39.990
It's marginal,but it's
all unos will approve.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.220
Dr. Jonas,you'll perform the recovery.

05:42.380 --> 05:45.140
Let me know if the liver looks
acceptable before we begin.

05:45.270 --> 05:46.680
Will do.

05:49.980 --> 05:53.270
Listen,I didn't mean to
sound like I was blaming you.

05:53.310 --> 05:55.390
I'm gonna fix the problem,nathaniel.

05:55.530 --> 05:56.790
I'm gonna fix it.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.340
Should I scrub in on
that liver recovery?

06:02.470 --> 06:04.080
I got your fellowship reports back.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.540
Oh?

06:05.680 --> 06:06.570
The consensus was that your work

06:06.700 --> 06:08.590
so far rates above average.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.930
Above average?

06:10.050 --> 06:10.760
That's good news.

06:10.880 --> 06:11.950
Above average?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.290
I'm not letting you go.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.830
You're not?

06:15.660 --> 06:18.190
- You're not.
- I'm gonna extend your fellowship.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.480
- What?
- One more year.

06:21.150 --> 06:22.170
Extend my fellowship?

06:22.290 --> 06:23.870
At that time,we'll
reconsider offering you

06:23.990 --> 06:25.630
an attending position.

06:25.770 --> 06:27.400
Extend my fellowship?

06:27.530 --> 06:30.060
Oh,I need you to oversee
mr. Moody's tests.

06:31.110 --> 06:31.930
Excuse me?

06:32.050 --> 06:34.280
Dr. Jonas won't be available
for the next few hours,

06:34.590 --> 06:37.070
so mr. Moody needs someone
to oversee his tests.

07:02.300 --> 07:06.300
My mother,um,wanted
meto ask you for a favor.

07:07.810 --> 07:09.310
Anything.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.500
She'd like youto deliver
my father's eulogy.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.670
How do you feel about that?

07:18.230 --> 07:20.640
I feel it's whatmy
dad would have wanted.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.290
Well,I'd be very honored.

07:26.860 --> 07:28.490
So you will.

07:29.670 --> 07:31.500
I'll do my best.

07:31.630 --> 07:33.050
Okay.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.520
This used to bemy father's office.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.470
Yes,I know that.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.910
Sloppy as hell.

07:57.890 --> 08:00.060
Missing cancerin a donor?

08:00.190 --> 08:02.790
It happens.You can't catch them all.

08:02.910 --> 08:04.920
Gonna cost some of
these peopletheir lives.

08:05.410 --> 08:06.480
Probably.

08:06.610 --> 08:10.270
Oh,it's guaranteed.Don't
soft-sell this one.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.540
Most of these peopleare gonna die.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.120
Bart,if you don't mind,I
have some work to do here.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.500
Do you onlysee these people?

08:20.240 --> 08:21.960
They talk to you?

08:22.090 --> 08:23.220
Not really.

08:23.340 --> 08:25.000
Sometimes?

08:26.210 --> 08:28.170
Once or twice.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.340
Maybe right now.

08:30.470 --> 08:32.419
Sloppier than hell.

08:33.830 --> 08:36.760
Missing cancerin a donor.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.730
Sloppier than hell.

08:54.550 --> 08:57.950
Well,darien,why don't you sit down,

08:58.070 --> 09:01.190
and we'll go over this donorsituation

09:01.310 --> 09:03.150
right from the top?

09:03.160 --> 09:06.340
- Bart,I have towrite your eulogy
-sit your assin that chair.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.990

09:11.620 --> 09:14.360
Your eulogy.I have to write it.

09:14.490 --> 09:16.010
So if you just...

09:16.140 --> 09:18.180
wouldn't mindleaving me alone...

09:19.010 --> 09:21.790
tests are back.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.450
How bad?

09:24.580 --> 09:27.030
Mrs. Fogerty's heartis fine.

09:27.510 --> 09:29.400
Mr. Moody's kidney

09:29.530 --> 09:33.100
and miss o'connell's
lungboth have cancer.

09:34.470 --> 09:38.230
So I need to go and notifyall
the tissue recipients.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.490
Let's go talkto your patient.

09:44.770 --> 09:50.120
Are you goingto scarborough fair?

09:50.240 --> 09:56.300

You have cancerin your right lung.

10:22.050 --> 10:24.150
Has it spread?

10:24.260 --> 10:27.270
No.It's just a small spot.

I just need a moment.

10:43.030 --> 10:46.380
Dr. Grant,dr. Jonassaid
the liver's good enough,

10:46.510 --> 10:49.300
so he's got mr. Nedvedready
to go downstairs.

10:56.210 --> 11:02.590
Without any seamsor fine needlework

11:03.260 --> 11:09.640
for once she wasa true love of mine

11:10.140 --> 11:11.350
how's mr. Nedved doing?

11:11.470 --> 11:13.470
He's stable.Heart rate's steady.

11:13.580 --> 11:14.340
And the new liver?

11:14.460 --> 11:15.860
It's coming.

11:15.980 --> 11:17.190
Retractors,please,jessica.

This guyhas got cancer everywhere.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.950
Oh,yeah.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.930
You know what?Tell unos
to take it elsewhere.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.340
So,what do you want to do?

11:34.460 --> 11:37.010
Let's clean all this up,get
as much cancer as we can,

11:37.140 --> 11:38.900
and send this guy hometo his family.

11:39.030 --> 11:39.790
Sounds good.

11:39.910 --> 11:40.650
Scalpel?

11:40.780 --> 11:42.600
Scalpel.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.200
I understand,dr. Stein.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.430
I understandthe position you're in.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.940
The tests didn't
work.We're all very upset.

Dr. Stein,if I can beof
any further assistance,

unfortunate situation

12:18.130 --> 12:20.670

one of the tissue donors.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.920
He's not clotting.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.120
Give him more platelets.

12:28.260 --> 12:30.430
That's not gonna work.Cryo,jessica.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.390
- Cryo.
- He's bleeding out.

12:33.310 --> 12:35.020
Can't findthe hemorrhage site. You?

12:35.140 --> 12:36.190
Vascular clamp.

12:38.730 --> 12:40.010
Come on,come on.

12:49.140 --> 12:50.680
We're losing him.

12:52.450 --> 12:53.910
We're flat.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.980
Forget it.

13:05.940 --> 13:07.630
You should haveleft that guy alone.

13:07.790 --> 13:09.350
Go away.

13:09.870 --> 13:13.570
Liver cancer like that
--it's always everywhere.

13:13.690 --> 13:15.240
Not always.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.770
- You wasted a good organto boot.
- No,I didn'T.I sent it back.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.180
Who's gonna take it now?

13:22.310 --> 13:26.060
- It's been on icean extra two hours.
- Go away!

13:27.460 --> 13:29.290
I --I do
something?

13:31.140 --> 13:33.300
No.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.570
I'm just,uh...

13:39.790 --> 13:41.820
that shouldn't havehappened.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.660
Yeah,I know.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.350
It shouldnot have happened.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.900
Come on,darien,don't take it so hard.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.690
Surgery like this,we lose
someof them. You'll see.

14:00.390 --> 14:01.710
The first one'salways hard.

14:01.830 --> 14:04.020
Tomorrow,you'll get
upand be right back at it.

14:04.140 --> 14:05.570
My first?

14:05.690 --> 14:07.520
I understand,dr. Getts.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.400
I understand.

14:10.820 --> 14:13.120
I understandthe position you're in.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.650
We did everything we could.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.880
We did every test.We
were as vigilant --

14:20.320 --> 14:22.350
I can't take this back.

14:22.490 --> 14:26.130
I'm sorry.Okay,I'm sorry.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.940
I wish I could,but I can't take it back.

14:35.150 --> 14:37.850
I think you missedthe phone right there.

14:45.310 --> 14:46.970
Rough day,huh?

14:48.400 --> 14:51.490
Worst day...of my career.

14:52.890 --> 14:55.390
Kate,there is no
wayyou could have known.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.000
Nedved died on the table,I heard?

15:02.560 --> 15:04.280
Yeah. Yeah.

15:06.620 --> 15:08.200
My god.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.880
Hey,come on.Let it go.

15:15.780 --> 15:18.270
I didn'tfollow my instincts.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.840
What does that mean?

15:22.460 --> 15:24.730
You meet a patient.

15:24.870 --> 15:27.040
You have a feeling about them.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.720
I got it. I got it.

15:30.170 --> 15:31.910
I got it.

15:34.190 --> 15:36.610
You make judgmentsthat
are almost always correct.

15:36.740 --> 15:38.750
Yeah,well,we try not to do that.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.560
We try to listenand learn.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.510
You come to conclusionsimmediately.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.800
Elizabeth mortonwas
a suicide --

15:47.440 --> 15:49.930
a woman my age.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.220
Same hair color,nearly the same size.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.000
She'd hung herself.And
when I first saw her,

15:58.360 --> 16:00.240
I looked at her fingernails,right?

16:00.360 --> 16:04.020
And I noticed that she
hadbitten them down to the quick.

16:05.050 --> 16:06.350
I looked at her nails,

16:06.500 --> 16:09.310
and I knewthat I should just walk away.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.110
- It's okay.
- I can't deal with this.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.610
I can't dealwith this kind of thing.

16:16.730 --> 16:19.860
It's okay. Hey,hey.Shh,shh,shh.

16:19.990 --> 16:21.880
It was the whole thing,and I missed it.

16:22.010 --> 16:24.210
I shouldn't have.It's
my fault. I missed it.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.200
It's okay.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.940
Just stop for a second.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.850
You good?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.110
Hmm?

16:44.310 --> 16:46.180
Tom.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.150
Tom,stop it.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.780
Okay.

17:00.140 --> 17:01.860
Why diyou do that?

17:01.980 --> 17:04.130
- Why?
- Yeah,why?

17:05.810 --> 17:07.550
What kind of questionis that?

17:07.680 --> 17:09.339
I mean...

17:09.990 --> 17:13.060
you,me.I -- I just
thought that --

17:13.190 --> 17:15.430
but why now?

17:15.579 --> 17:18.430
Because I thoughtthat
you need comforting,kate.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.210
That's not comfort,tom.

17:23.329 --> 17:25.859
Really? Okay.

17:29.830 --> 17:30.530
You know what?

17:30.620 --> 17:33.830
You are so...

17:34.520 --> 17:37.070
untouchable most of the time.

17:37.110 --> 17:38.560
You know,I just
thought -- I --

17:38.900 --> 17:41.260
listen,I
-- I --

17:45.580 --> 17:46.610
I'm sorry.

17:46.750 --> 17:48.700
I'm sorry.I thought you wanted me to.

17:52.540 --> 17:54.960
I didn't want that.

17:57.550 --> 17:59.650
I knowit's been a terrible day.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.360
And I'm sorrythat I did that.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.200
Kate...

18:34.930 --> 18:40.470
bartacobs
is --was.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.830
Bart jacobs was...

18:45.420 --> 18:48.110
- bart jacobs was...
- I hopeI'm not interrupting.

18:48.990 --> 18:51.130
No,no,no,I was just...

18:52.870 --> 18:54.900
I wanted to ask you,if you had a moment,

18:55.490 --> 18:57.970
to put a few thingsin the eulogy.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.030
Of course.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.200
Things that,uh,my father loved

19:04.330 --> 19:07.640
that,uh,he didn't bring
hereto the hospital.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.260
Please.

19:11.270 --> 19:13.010
Um...

19:13.860 --> 19:15.750
well,um...

19:15.870 --> 19:19.190
he always made brunch for
usevery sunday morning.

19:19.640 --> 19:24.200
And,um,he'd wear one of
mymom's aprons to make us laugh.

19:25.430 --> 19:29.760
And,um,he wouldnever
miss a family event --

19:30.760 --> 19:32.930
a wedding,a funeral,you name it.

19:33.750 --> 19:38.430
You know,whoever it
was,he'd be there,dancing.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.290
You know,he --he,uh,he
always danced,

19:41.430 --> 19:46.050
first with my mom and
then,uh...with anybody.

19:47.910 --> 19:51.230
He always danced.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.900
Anyway,um...

20:05.840 --> 20:09.200
if I think of anything
else,I'll give you a call.

20:17.660 --> 20:20.770
Hey,alice.I'm just
gonna check your lungs.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.100
Deep breath,please.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.610
Exhale.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.760
It's so easyto breathe now.

20:30.340 --> 20:33.620
Again. Exhale.

20:34.050 --> 20:37.140
All my life with the
disease,struggling for air,

20:37.260 --> 20:40.330
and it's so easy now.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.080
It's weird.

20:41.190 --> 20:42.890
Tonight,I'm supposed to be singing

20:43.010 --> 20:45.650
at this coffeehouseon the south side.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.960
I mean,I could never do that before.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.370
And now...

20:50.850 --> 20:54.060
alice,we have to make a choice.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.140
Okay.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.310
We can place you on the
listfor another transplant,

20:58.440 --> 20:59.860
but the wait is long,

20:59.990 --> 21:03.260
and there's no guarantee
thatyou'll survive the operation.

21:04.390 --> 21:05.930
Or?

21:06.040 --> 21:07.590
Or we can send youto an oncologist,

21:07.710 --> 21:10.000
and he'll treatyour cancer.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.600
But that meansno transplant

21:11.720 --> 21:15.230
and the possibility of a
radicalre-sectioning of your lungs.

21:16.630 --> 21:19.230
I thinkabout my donor sometimes,

21:19.370 --> 21:23.670
about how she lost her
life,how she gave me mine back.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.580
I tried to write a songabout her,

21:26.690 --> 21:29.720
but,you know,it's just not possible

21:29.860 --> 21:32.050
to put it into words,you know.

21:33.490 --> 21:37.020
I just couldn'tfigure out what to say.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.860
I thinkI understand that.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.760
So,what are my other choices?

21:45.360 --> 21:48.660
These are your choices,alice.There
are no other choices.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.290
Why don't you take some
timeto think about it?

21:56.410 --> 22:00.190
And,uh,I'll come back later.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.780
I can't come up with it,bart.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.080
I cannot figure outwhat
to say about you.

22:17.480 --> 22:20.810
I notice you've been
callingthat young lung patient

22:20.940 --> 22:23.360
by her first
name --alice.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.170
There's just too muchto consider.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.520
Hmm.

22:26.830 --> 22:28.830
You might want to
stickwith "miss o'connell."

22:28.970 --> 22:30.140
I can'tjust stand up there

22:30.270 --> 22:32.840
and read a listof your
life's accomplishments.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.540
First namesjust make it harder later.

22:36.660 --> 22:40.200
But...I can't neglect them,either.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.990
I also noticeyou've been spending

22:43.100 --> 22:45.720
a lot of your downtime
hereat the hospital.

22:46.170 --> 22:48.940
There's just one
storythat sums it all up.

22:49.070 --> 22:50.310
Particularlysleeping here.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.690
That's no wayto get any clarity.

22:53.270 --> 22:55.120
Just one story.

22:55.250 --> 22:59.170
And finally --and I
mean this,darien --

22:59.310 --> 23:01.970
do not have sexwith the nurses.

23:02.970 --> 23:05.570
That's a slippery slope.

23:07.590 --> 23:09.470
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:09.610 --> 23:12.180
There's a donorin western maryland.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.500
She's a perfect match.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.890
Same as elizabeth morton?

23:15.020 --> 23:17.760
Blood type,antigens.She'll
work for nearly everyone.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.370
Take jonas.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.580
I'd ratheryou came with me.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.740
Take jonas.I need to stay here.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.320
Organ Recovery Run

23:38.990 --> 23:41.160
Nothwesterm Maryland

23:42.420 --> 23:43.930
I need an angiogram doneto the heart,

23:44.070 --> 23:45.310
as wellas an echocardiogram.

23:45.430 --> 23:48.220
I need a ct scan of the
chestand a kidney biopsy.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.130
Kate,this is gonna take hours.

23:51.270 --> 23:52.340
I can't takeany more risks.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.470
These tests alreadyshow
positive blood cultures.

23:54.590 --> 23:56.010
No,they're barelyabove normal range.

23:56.140 --> 23:58.010
I can't take any risks.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.610
You can'teliminate all risk.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.010
I'm gonna need to speakwith her
primary care doctor as soon as possible.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.490
I'll wait across the street,then.

24:10.030 --> 24:11.290
I can't proceedwith this donor

24:11.420 --> 24:13.470
until I know everythingthere
is to know about her.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.300
Dr. Grant?

24:21.110 --> 24:22.900
Alice o'connelljust walked out.

24:23.020 --> 24:23.990
- When?
- Just now.

24:24.110 --> 24:25.480
She saidshe didn't want any treatment,

24:25.600 --> 24:27.430
and she walked out.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.630
If I'm not backin a couple of minutes,

24:28.680 --> 24:30.850
call dr. Gail to come
inand cover for me.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.230
- Here you go.
- Thanks,man.

24:52.340 --> 24:53.540
Hey.

24:54.380 --> 24:56.400
The tests won't be backfor five hours.

24:56.530 --> 24:58.380
I'm gonna goand get some sleep.

24:58.550 --> 25:00.220
Okay.

25:02.610 --> 25:04.760
You know,you were right...

25:06.180 --> 25:08.850
about goingwith your instincts,

25:09.770 --> 25:11.790
about first impressions.

25:15.030 --> 25:17.470
Like the first timethat I saw you,

25:18.470 --> 25:20.230
I got this tightnessin my guts

25:20.360 --> 25:24.250
and this,uh --this
feeling that was --

25:24.390 --> 25:26.710
I didn't like.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.850
You know,you werealready
dating dr. Grant,

25:31.980 --> 25:33.550
and I wasa first-year fellow.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.730
And I would alwayssee you,

25:35.860 --> 25:39.800
and my fellowshipwas tough.

25:42.820 --> 25:45.660
But no matterhow brutal my day was...

25:47.220 --> 25:49.620
you were alwaysin my head.

25:52.510 --> 25:56.590
Every day,I thought about you,kate.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.770
- Tom
-you know,I was always,

26:01.070 --> 26:03.620
in my heart,just...

26:05.770 --> 26:09.620
afraidof being with someone,

26:09.750 --> 26:14.160
just afraid of really beingwith someone.

26:16.890 --> 26:20.260
You don't have to tell meany of this.

26:20.390 --> 26:23.120
With you,though,I feel...

26:27.100 --> 26:30.760
I talk to you sometimes,and
I can't breathe.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.670
I know what I didwasn't right.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.850
But,you know,there's nothing I can do

26:45.980 --> 26:48.910
that seems to penetrate.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.450
You know,you're just...

26:51.570 --> 26:52.670
you're just so clean.

26:52.790 --> 26:55.460
You're so --you
don't break.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.260
But when you
did,it was --

27:01.480 --> 27:05.230
you know,to me,it was so beautiful.

27:06.580 --> 27:10.140
- My crying?
- Yeah,I know that's not fair.

27:11.970 --> 27:13.800
But it is the waythat I felt,

27:13.950 --> 27:17.660
and I wanted youto know that much.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.460
I just wanted youto know.

27:47.750 --> 27:51.420
So,I usuallydon't sing songs like this,

27:51.860 --> 27:56.670
but I kind of feel like itright noW.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.810
Smile

28:03.190 --> 28:07.470
though your heart is aching

28:08.950 --> 28:14.990
smile,even though it's breaking

28:16.620 --> 28:24.260
when there are cloudsin the sky

28:25.050 --> 28:28.730
you'll get by

28:28.940 --> 28:32.450
if you smile

28:32.580 --> 28:37.790
through your fear and sorrow

28:38.280 --> 28:44.640
smile,and maybe tomorrow

28:44.800 --> 28:52.070
you'll see the suncome shining through

28:52.610 --> 28:56.020
for you

28:56.140 --> 29:02.800
light up your facewith gladness

29:03.370 --> 29:10.540
hide every trace of sadness

29:11.670 --> 29:15.830
although a tear

29:17.420 --> 29:22.690
may be ever so near

29:24.040 --> 29:26.960
that's the time

29:27.100 --> 29:32.340
you must keep on trying

29:32.800 --> 29:34.930
smile

29:35.070 --> 29:40.180
what's the use of crying?

29:40.710 --> 29:44.570
You'll find that life

29:44.890 --> 29:48.800
is still worthwhile

29:49.470 --> 29:52.340
if you

29:52.470 --> 29:58.350
just smile

30:06.260 --> 30:07.650
So,there's a match?

30:07.770 --> 30:08.710
I put you on the list.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.540
We're working on getting itfor you.

30:10.670 --> 30:11.780
Do you thinkthis will work?

30:11.990 --> 30:14.110
You want new lungs,and iwant
to try and do that for you.

30:14.250 --> 30:15.940
Glad you're back,alice.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.660
Alice?

30:20.870 --> 30:24.360
That was beautiful
--your song.

30:25.180 --> 30:27.330
Thank you.

30:33.660 --> 30:36.600
Don't be so damn
heroicall the time,darien.

30:36.730 --> 30:37.730
What?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.850
Those lungs -- are you
thinkingof re-transplanting?

30:40.960 --> 30:42.140
Well,what would you do?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.650
Face the facts.

30:43.780 --> 30:45.020
Tell your patientto make the most

30:45.140 --> 30:46.210
of the time she has left.

30:46.320 --> 30:49.010
Then I'd step away.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.190
You're not superman,nate.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.480
You're a good surgeon,

30:53.600 --> 30:56.510
but you can't fix a mistakelike
this with your knife.

30:56.620 --> 30:58.700
The re-transplantwill work.

30:58.820 --> 31:01.540
Just cut your losses,nate.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.400
Put her on chemowhile
she can still handle it,

31:03.530 --> 31:05.750
and then just let hergo
back to her family.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.630
Dr. Grant.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.910
Vancouver,how's mr. Moody doing?

31:14.030 --> 31:15.390
Can I have a second?

31:17.160 --> 31:18.720
- Am I any good?
- Excuse me?

31:19.240 --> 31:20.750
Am I a good surgeon?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.360
I've always
kept a rule --

31:22.670 --> 31:24.150
you can ask meany question

31:24.260 --> 31:25.060
about any procedureor any technique,

31:25.190 --> 31:27.270
and I'll give youmy honest appraisal,

31:27.470 --> 31:29.470
but I cannot answerto
your entire talent.

31:29.580 --> 31:30.920
Yeah,but you judge it.

31:31.030 --> 31:32.770
I work with you in
hopesthat you'll learn enough

31:32.890 --> 31:34.390
to be a valueto this institution.

31:34.650 --> 31:35.380
But you know.

31:35.490 --> 31:37.130
You know who's good.You
know who's not good.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.590
My needs are selfish.I want help here.

31:39.700 --> 31:41.140
I want to runa successful hospital.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.300
- To do that,I need
-stop.

31:43.430 --> 31:44.880
Stop bullying me,okay?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.430
You got tounderstand something.

31:46.550 --> 31:48.390
I'm about a second away
from walking out of here.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.580
Okay.

31:51.030 --> 31:52.860
Should I?

31:58.260 --> 32:01.870
I quit twice,and I neverasked
dr. Jacobs to stop me.

32:02.300 --> 32:03.670
I quit of my own accord.

32:03.780 --> 32:06.680
And each time I came back,dr.
Jacobs said the same thing.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.390
He reminded methat this
thing that we do here

32:09.690 --> 32:11.800
is much biggerthan our feelings about it

32:11.920 --> 32:13.810
and that he neverwould
have invited me here

32:13.930 --> 32:15.580
if he didn't thinkI had the talent.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.450
Okay.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.790
Dr. Jacobs would say

32:18.910 --> 32:21.860
that the talentis all in our hands,

32:22.000 --> 32:23.420
and we have great hands.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.560
The ability to succeed,however,

32:25.680 --> 32:28.320
is in our headsand in our hearts.

32:29.350 --> 32:31.920
And so,dr. Simon griffith,

32:32.040 --> 32:35.080
I invited you herebecause
I believe in you.

32:35.350 --> 32:37.730
I asked you to remainbecause I still do.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.370
The rest...

32:41.730 --> 32:43.710
well,that's up to you.

33:05.910 --> 33:08.290
Hey. So,is it timeto go to the hospital?

33:08.370 --> 33:09.490
No.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.600
What is it?

33:18.440 --> 33:21.370
It's not that I don'thave
feelings for you,tom.

33:23.420 --> 33:24.660
Because I do.

33:26.580 --> 33:28.130
But?

33:29.160 --> 33:31.400
You're justgetting a divorce.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.000
I'm barely a year out.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.600
You know what,kate?I'm ready.

33:39.270 --> 33:43.620
You may think you
are.And...you might be.

33:45.910 --> 33:46.730
But...

33:46.820 --> 33:48.390
I just...

33:52.490 --> 33:55.610
I just need to bein this emptiness

33:55.710 --> 33:58.110
for a little while longer...

34:00.120 --> 34:02.620
until I knowwhy I'm coming out of it.

34:05.330 --> 34:07.090
It's not that I'm so...

34:09.159 --> 34:11.130
what did you call me?

34:13.070 --> 34:14.460
Untouchable.

34:14.870 --> 34:18.210
Yeah.I'm not...untouchable.

34:22.280 --> 34:25.699
I'm just alone...right now.

34:28.630 --> 34:31.639
And I've needed to bealone.

34:35.260 --> 34:37.560
But when I'm readyto
be with someone again...

34:40.170 --> 34:42.989
...I hope it's with you.

35:01.470 --> 35:02.280
We're leaving now.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.460
We'll be arriving in
pittsburghin two hours.

35:05.130 --> 35:07.210
Dexter moodyand alice o'connell

35:07.310 --> 35:08.910
will both be receivingat st. Jude'S.

35:09.030 --> 35:10.340
Bart's funeralis in three hours.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.330
I know.

35:11.580 --> 35:12.630
We're cutting it close.

35:27.670 --> 35:29.940
Hey.

35:36.770 --> 35:38.570
So...

35:39.520 --> 35:42.990
the story is that dr.
Jacobscalled dr. Grant darien

35:43.050 --> 35:45.190
for nearly 10 years.

35:46.110 --> 35:48.630
Dr. Grant's from connecticut,in
case you didn't know.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.880
I don't know anything
personalabout dr. Grant.

35:52.090 --> 35:53.530
Yeah,the story has it that

35:53.650 --> 35:56.290
at first dr. Jacobshated dr. Grant.

35:56.310 --> 35:58.690
I don't know -- "a silver
spoonin his ass" kind of thing.

36:00.180 --> 36:01.670
I haven't heardthat story before.

36:04.310 --> 36:07.060
- Hey,simon,sit down.
- Hmm?

36:07.150 --> 36:09.000
Hey,simon,give me that.

36:10.110 --> 36:11.250
Sit down.

36:14.150 --> 36:15.170
Yeah.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.460
The story is dr. Grantgot
fired about four times

36:19.540 --> 36:21.880
before dr. Jacobsfinally
made him an attending.

36:22.410 --> 36:23.690
I mean,it's just
a story,but --

36:23.780 --> 36:24.860
mary,I'm not dr. Grant,

36:24.970 --> 36:27.630
and dr. Grantis
certainly not dr. Jacobs.

36:28.050 --> 36:31.340
No,simon,you're not dr. Grant.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.480
Thank god you're not
dr. Grant.You're --

36:34.580 --> 36:37.490
leaving.I am leaving.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.760
You know,I could have been an attending

36:38.870 --> 36:40.550
at any hospitalin canada by now.

36:40.650 --> 36:43.280
Oh,so,then you'rejust
gonna crawl back home.

36:43.690 --> 36:44.590
Yeah.

36:44.900 --> 36:46.680
Is thatwhat you really want to do?

36:50.560 --> 36:53.070
So stick it outanother year.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.820
It's not like any of
usare going anywhere,

36:55.940 --> 36:58.250
so stay here and
sufferwith the rest of us.

37:02.610 --> 37:04.840
Look,I got to go backto work now.

37:05.670 --> 37:07.480
I really hopeyou do the same thing.

37:31.300 --> 37:33.670
- Can you zip me up?
- Sure.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.360
Your tie's crooked.

37:47.510 --> 37:48.200
There.

37:48.230 --> 37:49.530
Thank you.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.200
Janet and trippasked me to speak today.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.880
They thought that
bartwould have wanted that.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.920
So I sat downto write
this eulogy,and,uh...

38:16.930 --> 38:18.840
...I couldn't start.

38:20.430 --> 38:22.880
Maybe,um...

38:22.960 --> 38:25.240
maybe it's because I
thoughtthat once I started,

38:25.250 --> 38:29.270
I...wouldn't be able to stop.

38:31.130 --> 38:34.570
Or maybe it was justthat
I felt that,uh...

38:42.280 --> 38:43.260
that if I wrote this,

38:43.350 --> 38:45.380
it would meanthat
bart was actually gone.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.640
Organs are in,nate.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.600
The thing is,bart will
never really be gone.

38:53.690 --> 38:56.170
Darien,if you're gonna do this...

38:59.740 --> 39:02.540
great teachersare never really gone.

39:04.130 --> 39:07.680
...You got to go,son,now.

39:07.820 --> 39:10.290
If you're gonna do this,you got to go.

39:14.660 --> 39:17.430
Like I said,janet asked
meto do this,but...

39:20.020 --> 39:22.740
...I think that bart would
havewanted his own son to speak,

39:22.850 --> 39:25.030
instead of me.

39:25.130 --> 39:31.360
I was his student,his
coworker...his friend.

39:32.460 --> 39:34.620
But tripp...

39:36.690 --> 39:39.440
tripp is his son.

39:54.360 --> 39:57.900
- Thank you.
- I have to go.I have surgery.

40:02.650 --> 40:05.190
I have to go.

40:08.420 --> 40:10.060
Are you sureyou want to do this?

40:10.970 --> 40:12.540
I do.

40:12.640 --> 40:13.750
It's risky.

40:13.850 --> 40:15.560
This one's worth it.

40:15.650 --> 40:17.290
You think?

40:17.410 --> 40:19.070
Certain patients,you just know.

40:19.170 --> 40:21.400
Certain patientsdeserve
this kind of action.

40:21.490 --> 40:23.670
Well,whatever you thinkis best.

40:23.780 --> 40:24.910
I do.

40:25.420 --> 40:26.520
Even if I don't approve?

40:26.600 --> 40:28.440
Even if you don't approve.

40:28.910 --> 40:31.120
Okay,darien.

40:32.860 --> 40:36.110
But this time...you're on your own.

40:36.590 --> 40:38.780
Okay.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.010
You'll do fine.

40:46.930 --> 40:50.150
But you are on your own.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.640
I know.

41:03.030 --> 41:05.520
Dr. Stein,kate armstrong.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.750
I'm just following upon
the liver we sent you.

41:09.210 --> 41:11.780
I'm so glad it went well.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.800
That's such a relief.

41:13.910 --> 41:17.490
Yes,it was very lucky to finda
donor like this so quickly.

41:17.610 --> 41:20.940
We're all feeling very relieved.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.620
Okay,dr. Stein,I'm
sure you're very busy.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.380
Feel free to follow upwith
me if you get a chance.

41:27.280 --> 41:30.800
So,dr. Griffithhas
finished up with mr. Moody.

41:30.910 --> 41:32.840
The pancreasand kidney
went in just fine,

41:32.940 --> 41:35.640
and nathaniel is
transplantingthe lungs right now.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.740
Great.

41:40.070 --> 41:42.530
Did the other organsarrive safely?

41:42.850 --> 41:45.070
Yeah,I just spokewith the last doctor.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.860
Well,that's good.That's
good. You did good.

41:49.960 --> 41:53.900
Well,I,uh,just wanted
tofollow up and drop this off.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.690
I'll let youget back to work.

42:00.780 --> 42:02.030
Tom?

42:02.280 --> 42:03.650
Yeah.

42:28.610 --> 42:32.710
The first time I saw you,I
wanted to do that,as well.

42:40.910 --> 42:43.330
Yeah.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.430
Light up your facewith gladness

42:57.000 --> 43:01.990
hide every trace of sadness

43:02.870 --> 43:04.760
although a tear

43:05.760 --> 43:09.610
may be ever so near

43:10.590 --> 43:12.200
that's the time

43:12.330 --> 43:15.190
you must keep on trying

43:15.690 --> 43:17.200
smile

43:17.300 --> 43:21.110
what's the use of crying?

43:21.230 --> 43:23.320
You'll find that life

43:23.450 --> 43:25.710
is still worthwhile

43:26.500 --> 43:32.420
if you just smile
