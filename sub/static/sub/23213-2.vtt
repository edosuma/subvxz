Quite the opposite, actually.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.280
Yes, but there's another one

According to
the tournament director,
Les Doyle,

07:06.200 --> 07:07.920
Bobby Rodrigues made it himself

07:08.000 --> 07:09.360
just before the game.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.120
We better check it
for toxins anyway.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.520
His cigar.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.760
Check this, too.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.360
If he did ingest
the poison,

07:18.440 --> 07:19.720
these are
the two obvious candidates.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.920
Poor old Bobby Rodrigues.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.360
One minute he's holding aces,

07:24.440 --> 07:26.120
the next he's cashing
in his chips.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.040

07:37.520 --> 07:39.320
I'm not so sure
he ingested the poison.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.440
Looks like he might
have absorbed it
through his fingertips

07:41.520 --> 07:43.000
Something he touched
or held.

07:45.320 --> 07:46.800
Do we know
if he complained
of any pain

07:46.880 --> 07:48.320
or burning
in his fingers before?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.400

through the skin

07:53.920 --> 07:55.120

How long was he sitting there?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.800
Ninety minutes.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.080
And no one had moved
since the game began.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.560
Stand back, fellas.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.360
We need to seal off
this area right now.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.400
If it is fast-acting,
it's almost certain

08:05.480 --> 08:07.080
that Bobby was poisoned
during the game,

08:07.160 --> 08:08.720
which means that
something here

08:08.800 --> 08:10.400
is coated in a deadly toxin.

Let's get the lab to check
every single item on that table.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.680
No. Why?

08:27.760 --> 08:29.320
Well, no,
it's just that we believe

08:29.400 --> 08:31.080
that something
on that poker table

08:31.160 --> 08:33.880
was coated in a lethal
and fast acting poison.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.440
So, just wanna make sure
that none of you
came in contact with it.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.840
You think Bobby was poisoned?

08:37.920 --> 08:39.040

that way.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.960

Poor Mel
wasn't just a competitor.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.120
Bobby was her husband.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.200
So sorry for your loss.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.200
I just don't understand why...

09:24.280 --> 09:26.320
Why would somebody
want to hurt him?

09:27.360 --> 09:28.800
LES: She's right.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.400
Bobby was one
of the best loved
players on the circuit.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.680
Hmm.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.920
So, the match started at 4:00.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.280
And Bobby died 90 minutes later.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.960
I'll call your two...

09:44.360 --> 09:46.400
And in that time,
did anyone
approach the table?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.440
Perhaps to pour more drinks

09:48.520 --> 09:49.840
ADELAIDE: Definitely not.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.400
Once the game's begun,
no one's allowed
to approach

09:51.480 --> 09:52.840
or leave the table.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.960
-There's strict rules.
-Right.

during the game?

10:25.320 --> 10:26.560
Is the game cancelled

10:26.640 --> 10:27.960
or will there be
some sort of a rematch?

10:28.040 --> 10:29.680
Well, Poker Masters rules state

10:29.760 --> 10:31.360
we have to reschedule
within two weeks.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.440
Oh. Hmm.

10:33.520 --> 10:37.040
So that means
that somebody else
will get to win the $3 million.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.760
Most likely
someone here
in this room.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.080
You're not suggesting
one of our players...

10:43.160 --> 10:45.200
Oh, no, no.
Not at all, no.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.520
But you have to admit

10:46.600 --> 10:48.760
if Bobby was poisoned
during the game,

10:48.840 --> 10:50.400
well, it stands to reason,

10:51.680 --> 10:53.280
that only four people
could've done it.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.120
So, the $3 million question.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.920
How the heck
do you poison someone

11:04.000 --> 11:05.520
with half of Saint Marie
looking on?

11:05.600 --> 11:08.480
And with all the other players
scrutinising your every move.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.600
You searched everyone's pockets?

11:09.680 --> 11:12.280
Yes. No sign of any poison.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.840
This is where
they all got changed.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.360
Right.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.960
JACK: First thing is,
find out exactly

11:17.040 --> 11:19.120
which object
on the table
was poisoned.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.520
If we don't have
a murder weapon,

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
we're groping
in the dark.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.880
The Hand You're Dealt.
Maybe I should have a read.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.560
Although, to be fair,
The Idiot's Guide to Poker
might be more use.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.000
Look, Chief.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.120
It's perfectly simple.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.840
You have the blinds,
the flop, the turn,
the river,

11:34.920 --> 11:36.960
and you can check,
raise, call, or fold.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.240
Nope, sorry.
Just words.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.680
All I know is
it's about reading
your opponents, right?

11:41.760 --> 11:42.880
Right.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.520
You have to look out
for their tells

11:44.600 --> 11:46.160
but keep a poker face yourself.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.920
Well, this is gonna be
some challenge.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.480
We're dealing
with a group of suspects

11:51.560 --> 11:54.040
who literally
make a living
out of being unreadable.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.720
Chief?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.240
Robert Rodrigues.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.240
So, we've got a laptop.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.120
Mobile phone.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.640
Our man Bobby's
a bit of a contradiction.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.160
Cared enough about his health
to knock back the green sludge.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.200
But there he was,
puffing away
on a big, fat cigar.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.600
Chief?

12:18.040 --> 12:19.760
Who keeps glasses in a sock?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.320
Why didn't he buy a case?

12:21.400 --> 12:22.640
Good question.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.040
Oh, by the way, Dwayne?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.520
I meant to say,

12:25.600 --> 12:27.400
with Florence out of action,
I might need you to step up.

12:28.800 --> 12:29.920
A promotion?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.840
Oh, not as such, no.
I just mean...

12:31.920 --> 12:33.800
Do the sergeant's job
until she gets back?

12:33.880 --> 12:35.360
Well, yes, in a sense.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.920
It just means
a bit more responsibility,
just for a few...

12:37.000 --> 12:40.080
Don't worry, Chief.
I won't let you down.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.800
We'll make a dream team.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.080
Myers and Mooney.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.680
Okay, Mooney and Myers.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.080
Either way, I don't mind.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.200
Well, whatever.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.480
JACK: Hey, Siobhan.
It's your dad.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.200
So, how did you get on
with your essay?

13:02.760 --> 13:04.080
What was it again?

13:04.160 --> 13:07.440
Oh, yeah.
Descartes' view of the senses.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.720
But the big question is
are we here or not?

13:10.800 --> 13:12.560
Well, I'm here.
You're there.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.080
Well, actually,
you're not there.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.200
I'm talking to myself.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.320
Anyway, call me
when you can.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.680
Yeah. Love you.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.040
(SIGHS)

13:25.240 --> 13:26.800
JACK: Well, Harry

13:26.880 --> 13:28.280
I think therefore I am

13:29.440 --> 13:30.520
Discuss.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.040
You don't give
too much away, do you?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.520
You'd be a demon at poker.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.680
Morning, partner.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.280
Morning, Dwayne.
What's with the...

13:54.360 --> 13:56.040
Detectives don't wear
uniform, Chief.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.360
But you're not technically...

13:57.440 --> 14:00.920
Acting detective
is still a detective, Chief.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.240
Now, there's just one thing
I need to ask.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.920
Will I be getting a pay rise?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.520
You need to take that up
with the Commissioner.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.320
(LAUGHING)

14:10.360 --> 14:11.400
(SIGHS)

14:12.520 --> 14:14.200
Morning, Dwayne.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.160
Where's your uniform?

14:16.240 --> 14:17.560
And why do you have a briefcase?

14:17.640 --> 14:20.840
Listen, that contains
vitally important material.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.360
It's all right, JP.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.000
I know you're going
to miss working with me

14:25.080 --> 14:26.400
whilst I'm a detective.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.200
Detective?

14:28.280 --> 14:29.520
Well, acting. Unofficially.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.600
I can't believe
you've replaced me already.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.360
But you're supposed to be...

14:34.440 --> 14:36.720
I couldn't just sit at home
while you three
investigate a murder.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.960
Does the doctor know
that you're pulling

14:39.040 --> 14:40.680
whatever the opposite
of a sickie is?

14:40.760 --> 14:43.560
Well, actually,
my foot already
seems a lot better.

14:43.640 --> 14:44.720
Must be the meatballs.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.120
Well, what did I tell you?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.280
And I've promised
I'll stick to desk duty.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.560
JP's brought me
up to speed

14:49.640 --> 14:51.080
and I'm running background
on the suspects.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.200
But you need a partner
outside the station, right?

14:53.280 --> 14:54.400
Definitely, Dwayne.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.680
Now that DS Cassell

14:55.760 --> 14:57.120
has promised
to stick to desk duty.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.840
Sir.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.680
JP, did we hear back
from the lab?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.200
Yes, sir.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.960
And they tested
everything for poison
just as you asked.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.600
You've got to give it to them.
They worked through the night.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.120
So, results.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.440
Every single poker chip
tested negative.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.640
As did the smoothie glass

15:13.280 --> 15:14.720
and the cigar.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.120
(SIGHS) Well, something
must have
had poison on it.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.280
Here is our murder weapon.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.720
-The ace of spades?
-Yep.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.040
One of the two cards
Bobby was dealt
before he died.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.680
And the post-mortem
also confirms

15:23.760 --> 15:25.880
that the poison
was absorbed
through his fingers.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.000
Right, and do we know
what kind of poison
it was?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.640
Yes, something called...

15:30.720 --> 15:31.920
One second.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.800
Ah, yes. Batrachotoxin.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.600
It comes from
the golden dart frog.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.760
Shuts down
the nervous system
in minutes.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.560
Charming.
Where would you find
one of these fellas,

15:42.640 --> 15:44.960
these killer Kermits?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.440
They're native to Saint Marie.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.680
But only in, like,
certain parts
of the rainforest.

15:48.760 --> 15:49.920
-The rainforest?
-Hmm.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.160
So how did our killer
get their hands on it?

15:52.240 --> 15:53.520
You'd have to know
the right people.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.840
Or wrong people.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.440
So, at some point
during the final,

15:59.520 --> 16:01.920
our killer was able to get
their froggy poison

16:02.000 --> 16:04.160
onto this card
without anybody seeing.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.000
JACK: And then make sure
it was dealt to Bobby.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.200
JACK: How is that even possible?

16:07.280 --> 16:08.760
They played for 90 minutes.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.600
The deck was shuffled.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.520
The cards passed
from player to player,
hand-to-hand.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.920
So how come
no one else
was poisoned? Hmm?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.560
You think it was definitely
meant for Bobby alone?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.320
Well, we have to assume.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.160
Or why was he
the only one who died?

16:22.240 --> 16:24.240
And how could our killer
possibly know

16:24.320 --> 16:25.680
that this exact card,

16:25.760 --> 16:28.240
this ace of spades
would wind up
in Bobby's hand?

16:35.080 --> 16:37.480
LES: They're all identical.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.760
We open a fresh pack every game.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.040
I asked Adelaide
to pick a deck at random

16:42.120 --> 16:44.320
and she unwrapped it
in full view of the crowd
and the players.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.360
You can ask anyone.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.440
Maybe we will.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.480
So there's no way the cards
could have been tampered with?

16:50.560 --> 16:51.960
Absolutely not.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.320
The box was locked
in my hotel safe.
No one had access.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.200
That's your story.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.120
So it must've been poisoned
during the game.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.040
Well, that's impossible.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.040
I could see everything
from where I was sitting.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.800
Is there a record of the match?

17:03.880 --> 17:06.400
We've got a blogger
who does a play-by-play
throughout the final.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.600
You'll find it online.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.960
If there was no way
your deck could
have been poisoned

17:11.040 --> 17:13.560
before the game
or during the game.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.560
Well, that leaves
only one possible explanation.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.200
Which is?

17:17.280 --> 17:20.960
The poisoned ace of spades
was an interloper.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.840
JP, did the lab
send back the rest
of the deck from the game?

17:23.920 --> 17:25.000
Yes, sir.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.680
Sir.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.120
-Gloves.
-Oh, yeah.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.320
Yes.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.680
What do you think
he keeps in that briefcase?

17:48.760 --> 17:50.800
FLORENCE: It's either
forensic samples,

17:50.880 --> 17:53.520
criminal profiles,
or clean underwear.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.520
Aha.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.720
Just as I suspected.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.800
A second ace of spades.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.200
A fresh deck
is opened every game.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.920
There are 15 matches
in the tournament.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.480
So that means that this ace

18:06.560 --> 18:07.960
could have been taken
from any one of them.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.120
Of course.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.040
The killer card
wasn't in the sealed deck.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.200
It was poisoned
before the game

18:13.280 --> 18:15.000
and somehow slipped in
while they were playing.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.200
But how?
Without anyone noticing?

18:17.280 --> 18:19.120
Well, let's get this card
checked for prints anyway.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.520
Yes, sir. Sorry.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.440
So, Florence,

18:22.520 --> 18:24.480
what can you tell me
about these poker faces?

18:25.640 --> 18:27.800
FLORENCE: Bobby Rodrigues.
Born in Chicago.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.160
Been playing professionally
for 20 years.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.680
And how are his finances?

18:31.760 --> 18:33.320
Bank balance is pretty healthy.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.240
Last major transaction
was a few days ago.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.760
A hotel room
at the Panama.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.360
The Panama?

18:40.440 --> 18:42.760
But the rest of the players
are staying at the Rayon Vieux.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.200
DWAYNE: Why would he need

18:44.280 --> 18:46.240
a second room
at a different hotel?

18:46.320 --> 18:47.520
Maybe he'd had enough

18:47.600 --> 18:50.200
of being cooped up
with his fellow competitors?

18:50.280 --> 18:53.200
Four months ago,
he married Melanie Devaux
after two years together.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.480
She only turned professional
after they met.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.840
Before that,
she was a staff writer

18:57.920 --> 19:00.760
for a travel company
called Off the Beaten Track.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.120
And Eugene Sutton?

19:03.200 --> 19:05.360
FLORENCE: Oxford professor
turned entrepreneur.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.360
He made a small fortune
out of his "Sutton Strategy".

19:08.440 --> 19:09.680
JP: Sir?

19:09.760 --> 19:11.960
I've been looking
at online poker blogs

19:12.040 --> 19:15.080
and it seems like
there was a big rivalry
between him and Bobby.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.360
Right. And what about
the dealer, Adelaide?

19:18.440 --> 19:20.960
FLORENCE: Twenty-two years old,
left school at 16

19:21.040 --> 19:22.840
and worked in London casinos
before this.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.000
Her first international job.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.840
And then there's Ray Campbell.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.320
Ah, yes, the young man
of great charm and social grace.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.520
All I know is he's got
two convictions for assault.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.640
Now, that's more like it.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.040
And six months ago,

19:35.120 --> 19:37.560
he was suspended
for breaking another
player's nose.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.040
Does that count as a tell?

19:39.120 --> 19:41.600
With the bad publicity,
three sponsors dropped him.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.720
He's also got a failed nightclub

19:43.800 --> 19:46.960
that left him
owing half a million.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.560
He was number two seed, right?

19:48.640 --> 19:50.000
-And Bobby was number one.
-Correct.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.080
$3 million prize money

19:52.160 --> 19:54.120
would wipe out
his debt and then some.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.360
And if he got rid of Bobby,

19:56.440 --> 19:58.120
he'd be odds on favourite
to win the tournament.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.720
(INDISTINCT)

20:11.160 --> 20:13.280
Looks like you're taking
Bobby's death pretty hard.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.280
Never heard of drowning
your sorrows?

20:16.360 --> 20:17.960
DWAYNE: Okay,
let's get to the point.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.320
Detective Dwayne Myers

20:19.400 --> 20:21.240
and this is
Detective Inspector Mooney.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.080
It's all right, Dwayne,
he's already met us,

20:23.160 --> 20:24.600
so there's no need.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.680
Now, do you mind
if we ask you
a few questions?

20:27.720 --> 20:29.000
You can ask.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.240
Do you always carry
a pack of playing cards?

20:31.320 --> 20:32.400
Tools of the trade, ain't it?

20:32.480 --> 20:33.920
If I was a plumber...

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
You'd be sitting by the pool
with a spanner in your hands?

20:37.800 --> 20:40.520
So? Any idea
who done Bobby in yet or what?

20:40.600 --> 20:41.800
Yes. We believe...

20:41.880 --> 20:43.440
He was killed
by a poisoned playing card.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.800
Playing card?

20:44.880 --> 20:46.560
It could've been
any one of us
that carked it.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.480
Well, technically, yes,

20:48.560 --> 20:50.480
but Bobby was the only one
who touched the card,

20:50.560 --> 20:52.880
suggesting that
he was the target.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.080
Now, the question is,

20:54.160 --> 20:55.800
who stands to gain most
from his death?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.600
You tell me.
You're the detective.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.040
Well, we spoke to your bank.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.480
Turns out you're not
exactly flush
at the moment.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.320
Don't listen to the bank.
What do they know?

21:04.400 --> 21:05.560
It's just a glitch.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.440
Pretty big glitch.
Your sponsors are deserting you.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.280
And you are
half a million dollars in debt.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.600
One big win.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.000
That's all I need.

21:15.080 --> 21:18.000
One big win.
Say, $3 million?

21:18.080 --> 21:19.520
Now that Bobby's dead,

21:19.600 --> 21:21.400
I'm guessing
you're the odds on favourite
for the rematch.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.360
-That don't mean...
-We checked your match history.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.320
You played Bobby,
what was it, 15 times?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.080
Remind me,
how many times did you win?

21:27.160 --> 21:29.640
What are you trying to say?
I could only beat Bobby
by killing him?

21:29.720 --> 21:31.840
He didn't say that.
I didn't hear him say that.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.400
Listen to the man, nuh?

21:33.480 --> 21:35.720
It also strikes me
that of the five people

21:35.800 --> 21:37.440
sitting around that table,
only one had

21:37.520 --> 21:38.920
two previous convictions
for assault.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.440
Oh, not that again.
That's history.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.920
Pretty recent history, Ray.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.640
You broke a man's nose
only six months ago.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.480
Why? Because he stopped
you from winning?

21:46.560 --> 21:48.560
That weren't even about poker,
it was about a girl.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.040
Do your homework.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.320
Look, sometimes
I drink too much,
but that don't make me...

21:53.480 --> 21:55.400
Why would
I wanna kill Bobby Rodrigues?

21:56.080 --> 21:57.320
Besides $3 million?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.760
RAY: Oh, forget about the money.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.040
I looked up to Bobby, all right?
Ever since I was a kid.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.720
Yeah, I wanted to win,

22:04.400 --> 22:06.320
but not that much.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.960
So go point the finger
at some other mug.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.480
So, how am I doing?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.000
You know,
with the whole detective thing.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.400
Am I a natural or what?

22:18.480 --> 22:20.400
Well, full marks
for enthusiasm, Dwayne.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.360
I just wonder,
could you maybe dial it down?

22:22.440 --> 22:23.720
Just a smidge.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.160
No problem, partner.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.640
I don't want
to steal your thunder.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.160
It's important
to keep it elevated.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.280
JACK: Commissioner.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.920
If I knew you were coming,
I would've baked flapjacks.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.360
I'm disappointed in you,
DI Mooney.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.680
Your DS was injured
in the line of duty.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.160
You should have insisted on her

22:42.240 --> 22:44.040
staying at home
until fully recovered.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.760
Believe me,
I tried.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.120
Is uniform
no longer mandatory, Officer?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.000
Or are you working undercover?

22:50.080 --> 22:51.680
Not at all, Commissioner.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.960
I've just had a promotion.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.440
-Temporary...
-As detective.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.200
Acting detective.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.720
What Dwayne means
is while DS Cassell's
on desk duty, he's kindly...

22:58.800 --> 23:00.880
Offered to work
hand in hand
with DI Mooney

23:00.960 --> 23:02.200
to solve this murder.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.640
Well, we don't actually
hold hands, sir, as such.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.000
I see.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.800
Well, I can't stay.
I'm on my way to a meeting.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.840
I just stopped by
to make sure

23:12.920 --> 23:14.840
you've got your speech
ready for tonight.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.400
-My speech?
-You haven't forgotten?

23:17.480 --> 23:19.640
-My niece's lecture group.
-Ah.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.680
There are 13 nurses
breathlessly awaiting your talk

23:22.760 --> 23:24.160
on the life of a detective.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.600
I'm just putting
the finishing touches
to it right now.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.560
Good. Good.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.080
7:00 sharp.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.440
Counting down the hours.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.600
Thirteen breathless nurses?

23:39.400 --> 23:41.080
That's a whole heap of Caribbean

23:41.160 --> 23:43.360
for one man to handle,
you know, Chief?

23:43.440 --> 23:45.200
Don't you think
you might need
some backup?

23:45.280 --> 23:47.160
I appreciate
the concern, Dwayne.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.720
I'll radio in
if it all kicks off.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.760
So how's it going, Hopalong?

23:51.840 --> 23:53.480
I've been searching
Bobby's laptop

23:53.560 --> 23:55.080
and look at this.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.160
Bobby sent a series
of threatening emails

23:57.240 --> 23:58.720
to Professor Sutton.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.280
JACK: "The jig's up, Gene.
Quit while you're ahead."

24:01.360 --> 24:03.640
-Any replies from the Prof?
-Mmm hmm.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.360
"I shan't be slandered
by a crass colonial.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.120
"His lies are beneath
their dignity."

24:08.200 --> 24:10.080
-Blackmail?
-Certainly looks that way.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.600
I'll keep searching,
but first,

24:11.680 --> 24:13.400
you'll want
to take a look at this.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.800
This is what I found
on Bobby's mobile.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.520
Would you look at that?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.840
Adelaide sent it
to him yesterday.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.160
The dealer.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.680
They're having an affair.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.160
I wouldn't leap
to conclusions.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.680
Any idea where this was taken?

24:27.760 --> 24:30.440
I checked the time and date
against Bobby's bank statements

24:30.520 --> 24:31.960
and this was sent

24:32.040 --> 24:34.360
soon after he paid
for the room
at the Panama Hotel.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.120
JACK: Okay, so Bobby
and Adelaide
checked in at 12:15

24:40.200 --> 24:41.760
and went straight
to their room.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.600
Hmm, they didn't emerge
for five hours straight.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.960
And they ordered room service.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.920
JACK: So Bobby
then left at 5:15

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
and Adelaide followed
an hour later.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.680
I wonder why she waited
a whole hour?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.520
Isn't it obvious?

24:55.600 --> 24:57.560
Bobby and Adelaide
was having an affair.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.720
Bobby ended it.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.440
Adelaide swore
she'd get revenge,

25:00.520 --> 25:02.120
so she dealt him
a poisoned card.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.400
Job done.
Case closed.

25:05.880 --> 25:06.920
What did they eat?

25:07.520 --> 25:08.640
What?

25:08.720 --> 25:10.440
Room service.
What did they eat?

25:12.520 --> 25:14.560
So when did you
first meet Bobby?

25:14.640 --> 25:16.520
Two weeks ago.
When the tournament began.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.720
Since then,
you've got to know him
fairly well?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.600
Not really.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.640
We didn't get the chance
to speak properly
till a couple of days ago.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.080
I can see
why you're a dealer
and not a player.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.240
That was the worst bluff
I've ever seen.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.480
I'm sorry?

25:31.560 --> 25:34.160
No, I think what my colleague
is trying to say

25:34.240 --> 25:37.440
is that we have you
and Bobby on CCTV.

25:37.520 --> 25:41.000
At the Panama Hotel,
just a couple of days
before he died.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.440
Oh, and we also found this
on his phone.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.040
It's not what it looks like.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.440
I suppose
you're going
to tell us

25:48.520 --> 25:50.720
you didn't deal Bobby
the poisoned card, either.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.080
What? No.
I would never hurt Bobby.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.000
Yeah, well,
I put it to you that you
and Bobby were, in fact...

25:56.080 --> 25:57.400
It's all right, Dwayne.
Thank you.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.120
I know that you and Bobby
weren't having a relationship.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.360
The room service.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.400
You wouldn't order a pot of tea
and a selection of sandwiches

26:05.480 --> 26:07.440
if you were having
an afternoon of passion.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.240
And you probably wouldn't book
an economy twin, either.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.000
And then,
there's the body language.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.880
JACK: His hand
on your shoulder,
not your waist.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.360
Look at your faces.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.720
You're both nervous,

26:16.800 --> 26:18.560
as if you're still trying
to figure it all out.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.880
So I have to ask,

26:20.960 --> 26:22.080
if you aren't his lover...

26:24.040 --> 26:25.320
I'm his daughter.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.880
ADELAIDE: I always assumed
that Dad was some

26:33.960 --> 26:35.960
waste of space
from the estate.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.680
I should've guessed.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.680
Growing up with a dealer
for a mum,

26:39.760 --> 26:40.920
what else was he gonna be?

26:41.960 --> 26:43.400
Is that how she and Bobby met?

26:43.480 --> 26:44.760
At the casino?

26:44.840 --> 26:46.480
Then after Mum died,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.480
I found a letter

26:48.560 --> 26:49.560
from Bobby

26:50.080 --> 26:51.240
telling...

26:51.320 --> 26:53.120
Telling her sorry
but he...

26:53.200 --> 26:54.440
Wasn't ready
to be a dad.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.640
Couldn't stick around.

26:56.720 --> 26:59.080
So you were determined
to track him down.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.240
Well, I knew
he played the Masters.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.120
All I had to do was

27:04.200 --> 27:06.520
persuade Les
to give me the job.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.160
ADELAIDE: It wasn't hard,
to be fair.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.880
Why go to all the trouble?

27:09.960 --> 27:11.640
Why not just send
Bobby an email?

27:11.720 --> 27:14.600
I had to find out
what kind of man
he was first.

27:14.680 --> 27:17.440
You know,
get close enough to decide

27:17.520 --> 27:18.920
whether or not
to tell him the truth.

27:20.360 --> 27:21.480
And when you finally met him?

27:22.080 --> 27:23.880
He was...

27:23.960 --> 27:25.760
Everything I could've wanted.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.120
He was kind, funny.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.840
He was larger than life.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.200
Right.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.520
And when did you tell him
that you were his daughter?

27:38.960 --> 27:41.320
Couldn't have gone much worse.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.280
I'd been waiting
for the right moment.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.520
Uh, and the first time
me and Bobby
were alone together

27:47.600 --> 27:48.880
wasn't exactly ideal.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.520
It all came tumbling out,

27:51.600 --> 27:54.880
how I'd had to look
after my sick mum,

27:54.960 --> 27:56.720
how I'd found his letter.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.360
I was a gibbering mess.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.160
None of this explains
why Bobby needed
to book you a room

28:03.240 --> 28:04.600
in a different hotel.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.480
ADELAIDE: The island's
full of poker fans.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.320
Everyone knows who he is.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.960
We needed somewhere private.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.760
Somewhere we could talk,
get our heads around it all.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.120
Why didn't you go
for a drive?

28:15.840 --> 28:17.480
Take a walk on the beach?

28:17.560 --> 28:18.640
ADELAIDE:
Do you want proof?

28:20.400 --> 28:21.480
Here.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.840
What's this, now?

28:22.920 --> 28:24.640
The letter Bobby wrote to Mum.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.880
It's all there
in black and white.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.920
JACK: And you didn't
tell anyone else about this?

28:31.400 --> 28:32.760
You were the only ones who knew?

28:33.840 --> 28:36.160
I wanted to shout it
from the rooftops.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.240
But Bobby said
he needed to

28:39.320 --> 28:41.120
find the right time
to tell Melanie first.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.200
Do you mind
if we keep a copy of this?

28:46.280 --> 28:48.720
I'm still not sure
I'm buying it, Chief.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.120
You know,
the whole long-lost
daddy thing.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.200
Well, let's see
if he told Melanie.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.760
Let her corroborate
Adelaide's story or not.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.880
Sorry to disturb you.
Do you have time
for a quick chat?

29:01.120 --> 29:02.840
Is there news?

29:02.920 --> 29:04.920
Are you any closer
to finding Bobby's killer?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.640
We're pursuing
a number of avenues.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.160
Now, I just wanted to ask.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.120
Did Bobby mention anything
in the last few days

29:10.200 --> 29:11.320
about Adelaide?

29:11.400 --> 29:12.680
What about her?

29:12.760 --> 29:15.440
Well, we believe that Adelaide

29:15.520 --> 29:17.320
is Bobby's biological daughter.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.640
Who told you that?

29:20.720 --> 29:23.200
Adelaide.
Well, we just spoke with her.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.600
Apparently, she only told him
a couple of days ago.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.160
Yes, Bobby told me.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.000
He told her
not to tell anyone.

29:31.080 --> 29:34.040
He didn't say it to her
but he wanted
to do a DNA test.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.360
MELANIE: Just to be certain.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.480
A DNA test?

29:37.680 --> 29:39.960
He didn't tell you about this?

29:40.040 --> 29:43.440
Yes, well, he told me
there was a letter but...

29:43.520 --> 29:46.120
Well, it's not 100% conclusive,
is it?

29:48.040 --> 29:49.920
And do you think he believed
that she was his daughter?

29:50.000 --> 29:53.080
I think he wanted to,
strangely enough.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.360
But he just had to be certain.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.520
And did he tell you
that they spent
the afternoon together

29:57.600 --> 29:59.480
at the Panama Hotel
just two days ago?

29:59.560 --> 30:01.160
MELANIE: Of course.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.880
Now, why are you asking me
all these questions?

30:03.960 --> 30:06.000
Do you think Adelaide
had something to do
with his death?

30:06.080 --> 30:07.760
Like I said,
we're just looking
at a number of...

30:07.840 --> 30:09.480
Well, Adelaide can't be
one of them.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.520
Why would she kill the man
she believed to be her father?

30:17.960 --> 30:19.360
-Dwayne.
-Chief.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.880
-I need your poker knowledge.
-Go on, now.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.600
I've been reading
the live blog of the final.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.280
Here's what I don't understand.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.800
Bobby had two aces

30:26.880 --> 30:28.560
but he chose not to raise.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.000
Does that seem odd to you?

30:30.080 --> 30:31.240
Not necessarily.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.360
Sometimes you have to slow play
the best hand

30:33.440 --> 30:34.600
to keep the others in the pot.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.160
If you raise too early,
it can scare them off.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.480
There were still
two cards to go.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.480
So, he could've been playing
a long game.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.280
You see?

30:43.360 --> 30:44.960
Now you're getting it.

30:46.560 --> 30:50.080
So, I checked this
like you asked, sir,
and you are right.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.640
It came from a previous match.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.240
There are six different
fingerprints on it

30:53.320 --> 30:55.400
which means
it must have come
from the semi-final.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.000
Of course,
it's a knockout tournament.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.920
There are prints
matching the victim,

30:59.000 --> 31:00.600
the four suspects
and one other.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.320
So who was the sixth player
in the semi-final?

31:02.400 --> 31:04.800
A Dutchman
named Adrian van Hoobek.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.360
JP: Now,
I've contacted the Dutch police

31:06.440 --> 31:07.800
and as luck would have it,

31:07.880 --> 31:10.480
they had his prints on file
for a drunk driving charge.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.440
-Perfect match.
-Excellent work, JP.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.080
So where is he now,
this van Hoobek?

31:14.160 --> 31:16.640
Well, he went back to Holland
the morning of the final.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.000
That rules him out.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.400
Mmm. That means
we're on the right track.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.240
So, our killer has to be
one of these four people.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.160
JP: Uh, one other thing, sir.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.960
Shorty, the taxi driver.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.320
He told me
that he took Bobby
on three separate trips.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.800
Always to the same place,
always at the same time.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.320
-Early evening.
-Where?

31:34.400 --> 31:36.640
To a community centre
on the other side of the island.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.160
What was Bobby doing there?

31:38.240 --> 31:39.400
Well, according to the website,

31:39.480 --> 31:41.120
it could have been
a number of things.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.120
Bible study, life drawing,

31:43.200 --> 31:46.120
seniors tango,
dog training, diet club.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.560
Well, maybe take a trip
over there this evening.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.240
-See what you can find.
-Yes, sir.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.920
FLORENCE: Sir, I think
you should see this.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.840
I carried on
searching Bobby's laptop
and look what I found.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.280
He's got footage
from 10 different
poker games on here.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.720
They all seem to feature
the Professor.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.600
Studying his opponents' form.

32:03.680 --> 32:04.880
Not entirely unexpected.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.000
Only of the Professor?

32:08.080 --> 32:10.320
-None of the other players?
-Not that I can find.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.360
What was going on
between these two?

32:12.440 --> 32:15.200
It has to relate to those emails
in some way.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.520
Let's do some more digging,
see what we can discover.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.480
Will do, sir.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.920
(SIGHS) This murder
was carefully planned.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.360
Our killer pockets
the ace of spades
during the semi-final,

32:25.440 --> 32:27.600
coats it with poison
and then, during the final,

32:27.680 --> 32:30.520
slips it into the deck
without anybody noticing.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.680
Bobby, somehow,
gets dealt this exact card.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.760
But how?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.520
It defies all logic.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.160
It's like
some sort of magic trick.

32:40.560 --> 32:41.960
Could that be it?

32:42.040 --> 32:43.840
I mean,
magicians have
all sorts of tricks, don't they?

32:43.920 --> 32:47.240
Ways of palming cards
and concealing cards
up their sleeve.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.160
Let's go to the library.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.880
Let's see if
they got anything
on card tricks.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.720
-You can't go now, sir.
-Why not?

32:52.800 --> 32:54.480
Your speech
for the Commissioner's niece.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.280
Ah, for Pete's sake.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.920
I'm in the middle
of a murder investigation.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.400
I don't have time
to be sharing my wisdom

33:01.480 --> 33:03.280
with 13 breathless nurses.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.080
Well, I...

33:05.160 --> 33:08.840
Well, I suppose
as acting detective,
unofficially,

33:08.920 --> 33:11.280
I'd be more than happy
to stand in for you.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.440
Are you sure
you don't mind, Dwayne?

33:13.520 --> 33:15.600
-It would be my pleasure.
-Brilliant.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.120
Meanwhile, I'm gonna
learn me some magic.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.640
DWAYNE: Sorry I'm late,
Commissioner.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.520
COMMISSIONER:
You're not just late.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.320
You're the wrong person.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.680
Where's Inspector Mooney?

33:30.760 --> 33:32.840
Ah, he sends his apologies.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.520
He had to read
some magic books.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.120
But don't you worry.

33:36.200 --> 33:39.480
I'm ready, willing,
and able to deputise.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.920
The ladies are expecting
to hear about the life
of a London detective,

33:43.920 --> 33:45.880
not a local constable.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.640
I don't know
what to suggest, Commissioner.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.240
But then again,

33:50.320 --> 33:52.200
I'd certainly hate
to disappoint my niece.

33:54.520 --> 33:55.480
Her nurses are...

33:57.760 --> 33:59.360
Feverish...

33:59.440 --> 34:00.480
With anticipation.

34:01.880 --> 34:02.920
Feverish?

34:08.320 --> 34:10.640
Good evening, ladies.
Sorry to keep you waiting,

34:10.720 --> 34:12.160
but there's a killer
loose on the island

34:12.240 --> 34:14.240
and it's my job
to track him down.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.840
So don't worry,
Detective Dwayne Myers
is on the ca...

34:22.560 --> 34:23.640
Well?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.120
Eh...

34:25.680 --> 34:26.880
Go on.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.480
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

34:33.560 --> 34:35.280
FLORENCE:
The Prof's book is useless.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.640
It's not really about cards.

34:36.720 --> 34:40.080
It's more about
how to use poker
to win at life.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.720
Now, if I've got this right,

34:42.800 --> 34:45.000
all it should take
is a quick flick
of the wrist.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.640
Like so.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.320
Like so.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.400
Just hang on there.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.680
And the card should just...

34:55.680 --> 34:57.960
JACK: Oh.

34:58.040 --> 35:00.880
Don't you think
someone would have noticed
the killer do that?

35:00.960 --> 35:01.920
(MOBILE RINGING)

35:04.280 --> 35:05.840
JP, how is it going?

35:05.920 --> 35:07.200
JP: Ah, sir.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.200
So Bobby's trips
to the community centre

35:09.280 --> 35:11.040
were for AA meetings.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.120
AA?
So he wasn't
always a health nut.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.960
No. Well, apparently,
something happened

35:15.040 --> 35:16.200
at last year's tournament

35:16.280 --> 35:18.320
that made him
quit drinking on the spot.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.440
Right. Good work, JP.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.960
We'll look into it
in the morning.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.880
Listen, why don't you
go home to your wife

35:23.960 --> 35:26.760
and please send her
my apologies for working
you so late.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.680
-I will do, sir.
-Good man.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.160
Ah, nuts.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.920
This whole
sleight of hand thing
is harder than it looks.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.760
No wonder
so many magicians
resort to cheating.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.600
-Cheating?
-Yeah, look at this.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.760
Where's my book?

35:40.720 --> 35:41.880
JACK: See all these ads

35:41.960 --> 35:43.560
for various
conjuring contraptions,

35:43.640 --> 35:45.640
fake hand,
a spring-loaded thingy

35:45.720 --> 35:47.080
that fires cards
from your pockets.

35:47.160 --> 35:50.320
And this one,
X-ray spectacles.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.640
Well, to be fair,
I see some practical uses
for those.

35:53.720 --> 35:56.000
Unless of course
they don't work
and it's all a big con job.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.840
Wait a minute.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.160
X-ray glasses.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.520
Yes, that could be it.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.640
You think the killer
was wearing X-ray glasses?

36:05.720 --> 36:07.640
I'm not 100% sure, Florence.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.200
I need to check
something in the morning

36:09.280 --> 36:11.800
But if I'm right,
one of our suspects

36:11.880 --> 36:13.240
is looking very guilty indeed.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.280
(HONKING HORN)

36:26.720 --> 36:27.840
JACK: Morning, Dwayne.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.080
Thought you might like a lift.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.200
A lift?
It's not even 7:00.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.920
I'm still running my bath.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.320
There's no time
for a bath now.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.920
I need to show you
a magic trick.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.040
Dwayne,
you got the queen of spades.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.880
Florence, four of clubs.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.920
-Exactly. How did you do that?
-It's very simple.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.440
-The glasses in the sock.
-The very same.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.400
Last night,
I was researching magic

36:54.160 --> 36:55.480
when I found this.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.200
X-ray specs,
which put me in mind of these.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.880
So, as an experiment,

36:59.960 --> 37:01.720
I marked the back of the cards
with UV ink.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.720
The same ink we'd use
to track down stolen bikes.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.600
And, hey, presto, X-ray vision.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.720
X-ray vision?
Come on.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.840
Now I know
when I'm playing
with Winky Bob,

37:09.920 --> 37:11.080
he will try and scam me.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.640
But these guys are meant
to be professional.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.960
So Bobby was a big cheat?

37:15.040 --> 37:16.560
Well,
that was my first thought, too.

37:16.640 --> 37:20.160
But then,
I remembered the videos
on Bobby's laptop.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.600
It's footage of the Professor
taken from 10 different games.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.560
And look what he's wearing
in every single one.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.360
JACK: Oh, see
how he slips his hand
into his pocket?

37:27.440 --> 37:28.880
Dabs his finger in the UV ink,

37:29.920 --> 37:31.920
then marks the back of a card,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.880
then he can watch
the card travel
around the table

37:33.960 --> 37:35.160
through his special shades.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.600
So much
for his winning strategy.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.120
Yeah,
Bobby must have worked it out,

37:38.200 --> 37:39.840
which is why
he stole the Prof's glasses

37:39.920 --> 37:41.600
and sent him
all those threatening emails.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.040
You think Bobby
was blackmailing him?

37:43.120 --> 37:44.600
Well, I think we should
ask the Professor.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.640
Mmm.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.000
No doubt,
you've all heard of...

37:50.080 --> 37:51.400
Beginner's luck.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.360
Well, I'm here to tell you
there's no such thing.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.240
In fact

37:55.320 --> 37:57.960
the only people
dumb enough
to believe in luck

37:58.040 --> 38:00.000
are beginners.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.560
I couldn't agree more,
Professor.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.520
Do you mind? These gentlemen
have paid a great deal of money.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.440
Well, I'm sorry
for interrupting.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.000
Now, I was just wondering.
Do you have time
for a quick chat?

38:11.960 --> 38:14.520
EUGENE: All right,
so, I...I...

38:16.840 --> 38:18.280
I cheated.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.720
It was an aberration,
a moment of madness.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.920
No.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.280
Once would be madness,
twice would be careless.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.440
But you've been
running this racket
all the way back

38:27.520 --> 38:29.760
to the Black Rock Final in 2012.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.840
We've seen the footage.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.520
I was under immense pressure
from my publishers.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.200
The sales of the book were

38:38.280 --> 38:39.560
riding on the back of the wind.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.080
Oh, well, in that case...

38:42.640 --> 38:43.960
So what was Bobby demanding?

38:44.040 --> 38:45.400
Did he want you
to pay back the money?

38:45.480 --> 38:46.960
-Throw the final?
-Throw the final?

38:48.080 --> 38:50.000
You're not a poker player,
are you?

38:50.080 --> 38:51.880
It's almost impossible
to lose deliberately.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.920
Although I admit, I, um...

38:55.000 --> 38:57.480
Have a variety
of strategies.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.440
But not even I can control
which cards are dealt.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.040
So what did he want?

39:02.120 --> 39:03.320
Why didn't he blow the whistle?

39:03.400 --> 39:04.800
'Cause he was enjoying
himself too much.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.280
He loved having the power.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.960
Besides, he knew if he

39:09.040 --> 39:11.360
blabbed
about my misdemeanours,

39:12.440 --> 39:14.920
I might blab about his.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.760
Would this have anything
to do with last year's final?

39:18.600 --> 39:22.520
I'm not sure
it's my place to say.

39:23.680 --> 39:26.200
You can't slander
the dead, Professor.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.160
And given what we know
about your misdemeanours,

39:29.240 --> 39:30.920
it'd very much
be in your interest

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
to share what you know.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.640
So come on.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.360
Bobby used to drink.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.440
I mean, he could put it away.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.640
And then,
his eye would start to wander.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.000
That's what led
to him dropping out
of last year's tournament.

39:46.480 --> 39:48.200
Well, go on.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.440
What happened?

39:49.520 --> 39:50.840
Well...

39:50.920 --> 39:52.480
On this particular occasion,

39:52.560 --> 39:54.640
Melanie woke to find Bobby

39:55.760 --> 39:57.200
gone a-wandering

39:57.280 --> 39:58.320
and went looking for him.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.880
And she found him

40:01.960 --> 40:03.960
giving a rather generous tip
to a waitress.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.080
If you catch my meaning.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.040
Bobby went after her.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.600
She wasn't in their room,
she wasn't anywhere.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.640
In fact, he was so desperate,

40:14.720 --> 40:16.640
he even roped me
into the search party.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.120
Eventually, we found her
on the beach,

40:20.200 --> 40:21.920
threatening to drown herself.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.280
We just got there in time.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.560
After that,

40:27.360 --> 40:29.560
Melanie had a breakdown

40:29.640 --> 40:32.920
and Bobby dropped out
of the final,
joined AA.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.400
Swore he'd never have a drink
or look at another woman again.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.480
Personally, I
wasn't that convinced

40:39.560 --> 40:41.240
but she seemed to believe him.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.360
JACK: And you didn't think
any of this was worth
mentioning before?

40:51.400 --> 40:53.120
I didn't think
it was relevant, no.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.640
Bobby had changed.
Why drag up the past?

40:55.720 --> 40:57.400
Well, you seem
very certain of that.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.120
How much more proof do you need?

41:00.240 --> 41:01.840
MELANIE: He'd just passed
a year sober,

41:01.920 --> 41:03.600
we got married,
we were buying a house.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.120
The Bobby I first met
lived out of a suitcase.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.120
And how did you meet?
If you don't mind me asking.

41:10.520 --> 41:13.000
We met on social media,
of all places.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.960
I was just an amateur
at that point.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.640
A fan, really, and, um,

41:20.120 --> 41:22.640
I asked him a question
about how to avoid tilt.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.360
Tilt?

41:24.440 --> 41:26.240
When you lose
your head
at the table,

41:26.320 --> 41:28.040
make bad decisions.

41:28.120 --> 41:31.480
Ah. And eventually,
this online relationship,

41:31.560 --> 41:33.600
it turned into a real one?

41:33.680 --> 41:35.440
Before I knew it,
I was giving up my job

41:35.520 --> 41:38.000
and following him around
the international poker circuit.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.520
My friends thought
I'd lost my mind.

41:43.840 --> 41:44.960
And then I did, briefly.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.320
Bobby clearly caused you
a great deal of anguish.

41:51.080 --> 41:53.360
Perhaps you found it hard
to trust him

41:53.440 --> 41:54.640
and for a good reason?

41:55.440 --> 41:56.440
No.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.360
Like I said,
Bobby had changed.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.600
It was the one good thing
to come out of my breakdown.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.960
It was agony at the time,
but we promised each other,

42:09.240 --> 42:10.600
no more secrets.

42:12.840 --> 42:15.480
You can't honestly think
I'd kill the only man
I ever loved?

42:20.680 --> 42:22.520
Three men and two women

42:22.600 --> 42:24.400
sit at a poker table
for 90 minutes.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.000
At some point,
one of them

42:26.080 --> 42:28.520
palms a poisoned ace of spades
into the deck.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.840
And as if
by some kind of Obia magic,

42:30.920 --> 42:32.640
that card gets dealt
to Bobby Rodrigues.

42:32.720 --> 42:33.920
And no one else touches it.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.640
Not the poisoner,
not the other players.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.040
Not even the dealer.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.040
Tell me,
how is that
even possible, Dwayne?

42:39.120 --> 42:40.480
I wish I could, Chief.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.680
We have four suspects.
Each of them has a motive.

42:42.760 --> 42:45.640
The dealer, seeking revenge
on the father who abandoned her.

42:45.720 --> 42:46.720
I'm his daughter.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.000
The broke number two,

42:49.080 --> 42:51.160
eager to get rid
of the competition.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.920
One big win,
that's all I need.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.240
The Professor, scared that his
serial scam might be uncovered.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.960
I was under immense pressure
from my publishers.

43:00.040 --> 43:03.520
And the wife
he'd driven
to a nervous breakdown.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.720
You can't honestly think
I'd kill the only man
I ever loved?

43:07.320 --> 43:09.000
I really thought
by now someone

43:09.080 --> 43:10.480
would have given
themselves away.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.480
Slip of the tongue,
a clumsy lie.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.360
-A tell.
-A tell, exactly.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.040
Yes, the best poker players
never give themselves away.

43:18.120 --> 43:19.520
They're either so aggressive

43:19.600 --> 43:21.160
you have no idea
if they're winning
or losing

43:21.240 --> 43:22.520
or they're so unassuming

43:22.600 --> 43:24.000
you wouldn't think
they had it in them
to bluff.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.560
-You know what I need to do now?
-No.

43:33.520 --> 43:34.640
I need to buy a cigar.

43:41.280 --> 43:42.760
(JACK COUGHING)

43:47.200 --> 43:49.160
So, at this point,
Eugene folds.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.200
Ray then raises $150,000.

43:53.040 --> 43:54.360
RAY: I'll raise you $150,000.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.680
Before Melanie folds, too.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.720
I'm out.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.040
And now, it's back to Bobby.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.640
Bobby calls Ray's 150

44:05.720 --> 44:08.000
before Adelaide deals
three more cards.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.000
Seven of diamonds,
ace of clubs and...

44:14.320 --> 44:16.040
Mrs Haddock,
the fisherman's wife?

44:16.120 --> 44:19.120
Oh, yes, I found these cards
in the evidence store.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.720
Half the deck was missing,
so I had to make
a few substitutions.

44:21.800 --> 44:24.240
JACK: You just have to imagine
that's a four of diamonds, okay?

44:24.320 --> 44:25.440
(MUTTERS) Four of diamonds...

44:25.520 --> 44:27.600
So, anyway, Ray then bets...

44:28.440 --> 44:29.800
RAY: $200,000.

44:33.440 --> 44:36.040
JACK: Bobby checks his cards.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.720
-And even though he's holding...
-Mr Bacon, the butcher?

44:38.800 --> 44:41.520
No, like I said, you just have
to imagine a different card.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.480
-An ace.
-Ace, four of diamonds...

44:43.560 --> 44:45.640
So, even though
he's holding two aces,

44:45.720 --> 44:47.840
he doesn't raise,
he calls.
Why?

44:47.920 --> 44:49.000
Because he's playing
a long game.

44:49.680 --> 44:50.920
I'll call your 150.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.080
He's hiding that
he's got a good hand.
Right, Dwayne?

44:55.160 --> 44:56.800
-Right.
-Wait a minute.

44:57.640 --> 44:58.680
A different card.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.160
Dwayne.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.920
-What card is this?
-Ace of spades.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.240
Except it isn't, is it?

45:05.320 --> 45:06.640
It's Mr Bacon, the butcher.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.920
But you just...

45:09.000 --> 45:11.480
How can we be sure
he wasn't holding Mr Bacon

45:11.560 --> 45:14.080
or Mrs Kipper
or Mr Trim, the tailor?

45:14.160 --> 45:15.280
Now you've lost me.

45:15.360 --> 45:16.880
What if we've been looking
at this all wrong?

45:16.960 --> 45:18.640
What if Bobby never
had an ace of spades?

45:18.720 --> 45:20.960
But that card was definitely
the only thing

45:21.040 --> 45:22.560
with any trace of poison
left on it.

45:22.640 --> 45:24.560
Any trace left.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.680
What if they made the evidence
disappear, like a magic trick?

45:26.760 --> 45:28.640
Like a playing card
up the sleeve?

45:32.600 --> 45:34.200
These blotches.

45:34.280 --> 45:35.720
His thumb
and his two forefingers.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.240
The ace of spades.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.600
LES: All identical.
We open a fresh pack
every game.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.080
Batrachotoxin.

45:41.160 --> 45:42.840
It comes
from the golden dart frog.

45:42.920 --> 45:46.080
But not even I can control
which cards are dealt.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.600
I'll be jiggered.

45:47.680 --> 45:49.520
JP, Florence,
round up the suspects.

45:49.600 --> 45:50.920
Meet me at Le Mirage.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.800
Dwayne, I need you to check
something for me, please.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.760
-You know who did it?
-I believe I do.

45:54.840 --> 45:57.200
But I'm not ready
to reveal my hand,
not just yet.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.640
I have to be honest.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.600
Up until a couple of days ago,

46:05.680 --> 46:07.560
I'd never really seen
the appeal of poker.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.000
I thought
it was just a silly card game

46:09.080 --> 46:11.080
where now and again,
people lose their shirts.

46:11.160 --> 46:13.440
But with the help
of my associate here,

46:13.520 --> 46:15.760
I realised I was wrong.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.160
Of course, poker's not really
a card game at all, is it?

46:18.240 --> 46:19.600
JACK: It's a game of people

46:19.680 --> 46:21.160
that just happens
to be played with cards.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.600
Such as this one.

46:26.680 --> 46:28.640
What is it?
Well...

46:28.720 --> 46:31.520
Essentially,
it's just a small piece
of paper with a picture on it.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.840
But the power this fella has...

46:33.920 --> 46:36.240
He can make your fortune,
he can ruin you.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.000
Or in the case
of this particular card,

46:39.160 --> 46:40.240
he can kill you.

46:44.680 --> 46:46.560
Four world-class players

46:46.640 --> 46:47.760
were sitting around this table

46:47.840 --> 46:49.960
for the final
of the Caribbean Masters.

46:50.040 --> 46:53.400
But only one of you
was dealt the fatal
ace of spades.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.880
The unfortunate Bobby Rodrigues.

46:56.960 --> 46:59.720
So, the question
that was puzzling me
right from the outset

47:00.480 --> 47:02.400
is how did the killer

47:02.480 --> 47:04.760
get the poisoned card
into Bobby's hand?

47:06.480 --> 47:08.200
JACK:
And even more impressively,

47:08.280 --> 47:10.360
how did they manage it
in full view
of the audience

47:11.160 --> 47:12.720
and under the intense

47:12.800 --> 47:14.160
scrutiny of their opponents?

47:15.280 --> 47:16.840
Well, the answer seems obvious.

47:16.920 --> 47:18.800
After all,
there's only one person

47:18.880 --> 47:20.440
who decides which cards

47:20.520 --> 47:21.760
are dealt to whom.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.400
Me?

47:24.480 --> 47:26.080
Why would I want to kill
my own father?

47:26.720 --> 47:28.040
Your father?

47:28.120 --> 47:29.960
The father who abandoned you
before you were even born.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.400
JACK: You gave up
your education,

47:32.480 --> 47:35.400
you gave up your future
to look after your sick mother.

47:35.480 --> 47:37.000
Bobby owed you
for all those missing years.

47:37.400 --> 47:38.560
No, I...

47:38.640 --> 47:40.680
I just wanted to meet him,
to get to know him.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.320
And yet,
all the evidence would suggest

47:42.400 --> 47:44.160
that you are the only person

47:44.240 --> 47:46.120
who could've dealt
Bobby the fatal hand.

47:49.680 --> 47:50.880
Or at least

47:50.960 --> 47:52.520
that's what our real killer
wanted us to think.

47:53.520 --> 47:56.160
Now, I'm no poker player.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.920
But this, this also puzzled me.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.840
If Bobby had two aces,

48:00.920 --> 48:03.200
why did he only match Ray's bet?

48:03.280 --> 48:05.840
I know, I know,
the obvious explanation

48:05.920 --> 48:07.160
is that he was playing
a long game.

48:07.240 --> 48:08.640
Of course he was.

48:08.720 --> 48:10.200
What other reason
could he have?

48:10.280 --> 48:12.880
What if Bobby didn't have
two aces at all?

48:13.920 --> 48:15.400
What if at the moment he died,

48:15.480 --> 48:17.840
he was actually holding an ace
and a much lower card?

48:17.920 --> 48:21.480
Let's say,
for the sake of argument,
a three of hearts.

48:21.560 --> 48:24.240
Bobby wasn't playing
a long game at all.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.880
Because mark my words,
this poison card,

48:25.960 --> 48:27.480
this ace of spades,

48:27.560 --> 48:30.000
it wasn't placed on the table
until after Bobby died.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.360
So what killed him, then?

48:34.440 --> 48:36.280
You said the ace
was the only thing
on the table

48:36.360 --> 48:37.520
with poison on it.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.480
I said
it was the only thing left

48:39.560 --> 48:41.640
on the table
with poison on it.

48:41.720 --> 48:44.080
But that's because
the real murder weapon

48:44.160 --> 48:45.520
had already gone up in smoke.

48:46.960 --> 48:48.360
Now, Bobby,

48:48.440 --> 48:50.280
he might well have turned
over a new leaf.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.840
But he still had one weakness.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.800
These things will kill you,

48:58.880 --> 49:01.640
especially if their tips
are laced with Batrachotoxin.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.200
Here, here and here.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.760
His thumb
and his two forefingers.

49:07.720 --> 49:09.160
The blotches on Bobby's fingers

49:09.240 --> 49:11.240
were exactly where
he'd hold a playing card.

49:11.320 --> 49:13.040
But they're also where
he'd hold a cigar

49:14.120 --> 49:15.280
as he cut off its tip.

49:16.800 --> 49:18.240
JACK: Now, all the while
the lethal poison

49:18.320 --> 49:20.320
was making its way
through his bloodstream,

49:20.400 --> 49:22.600
the poisoned tip
was burning away.

49:22.680 --> 49:25.800
All traces of it disappeared
in a puff of smoke.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.360
Like some sort
of conjuring trick.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.960
But who would have
the opportunity to poison
Bobby's cigar?

49:33.040 --> 49:34.400
JACK: And who on Earth

49:34.480 --> 49:36.800
would be able
to get their hands
on an obscure poison

49:36.880 --> 49:39.160
derived solely
from a rainforest frog?

49:40.600 --> 49:42.080
Well, perhaps only someone

49:42.160 --> 49:44.360
who spent years
travelling to far-flung places.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.240
She was a staff writer

49:46.320 --> 49:49.640
for a travel company called
Off the Beaten Track.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.240
Researching local knowledge
for a living.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.480
Oh. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

49:56.560 --> 49:57.720
This is absurd.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.520
Why would I kill Bobby?

50:00.600 --> 50:03.120
Because you believed
that history was repeating
itself.

50:03.200 --> 50:05.040
And Bobby was being
less than honest,

50:05.120 --> 50:06.280
just like before,

50:06.360 --> 50:07.400
when he betrayed your trust

50:08.440 --> 50:10.240
But I told you
we were over that.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.880
But contrary
to what you said to us,

50:11.960 --> 50:13.560
Bobby hadn't told you anything

50:13.640 --> 50:15.120
about Adelaide
being his daughter,

50:15.200 --> 50:16.560
had he?

50:16.640 --> 50:17.600
Yes, Bobby told me.

50:19.360 --> 50:21.400
Now, I have to give full credit
to my associate,

50:21.480 --> 50:23.720
Acting Detective Myers.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.680
It was Dwayne's knowledge
of poker that tipped me off.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.960
As he said himself,

50:28.040 --> 50:30.000
top players
are either aggressive...

50:30.080 --> 50:31.480
Or they're so unassuming,

50:31.560 --> 50:34.120
you wouldn't think
they had it
in them to bluff.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.040
Which sums you up to a tee.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.920
You turned pro
less than two years ago,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.280
and you've risen
straight to the top.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.240
You're clearly a natural.

50:41.760 --> 50:42.800
Natural liar.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.080
Which is why
when we asked you

50:45.160 --> 50:46.600
about Adelaide
being Bobby's daughter

50:47.640 --> 50:49.040
your face showed no emotion.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.560
Perfect poker face.

50:52.640 --> 50:56.160
Adelaide is actually
Bobby's biological daughter.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.400
Although inside,
I'm sure you were horrified.

51:00.520 --> 51:03.560
Now, I have no idea
where Bobby said
he was going

51:03.640 --> 51:06.520
when he slipped off
to the Panama Hotel
that afternoon

51:06.600 --> 51:08.680
but whatever his excuse was,
you weren't buying it.

51:08.760 --> 51:10.000
Hey, sweetheart.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.680
I just picked up
a private game.

51:11.760 --> 51:12.920
Just a few of the boys.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.560
DWAYNE: So you followed him.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.000
All the way to the Panama Hotel.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.840
We almost missed it

51:20.920 --> 51:23.480
until we checked the CCTV
outside the hotel,

51:24.400 --> 51:26.720
and saw you standing there,

51:26.800 --> 51:29.200
watching Bobby
and Adelaide
go inside together.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.680
I imagine you'd already noticed
the awkward looks between them.

51:34.760 --> 51:36.000
The tiny tells.

51:36.080 --> 51:37.520
Small wonder
when he just learned

51:37.600 --> 51:38.960
he had a long-lost daughter.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.360
But you didn't see it that way.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.160
JACK: So you hatched a plan.

51:42.240 --> 51:44.400
You waited until
after the semi-final

51:44.480 --> 51:46.000
and took the ace of spades
from the table.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.920
And then, somehow,

51:49.000 --> 51:51.240
you got hold
of the Batrachotoxin
on the black market.

51:52.280 --> 51:53.880
And then

51:53.960 --> 51:55.880
I assume when Bobby
was getting ready,

51:55.960 --> 51:57.800
you poisoned
the tip of his cigar.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.000
JACK: Then after that, well,

52:01.080 --> 52:04.000
all you had to do
was wait for the panic
after Bobby collapsed

52:04.080 --> 52:06.680
so you could slip
the poisoned card
onto the table.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.400
Creating the illusion

52:09.480 --> 52:11.600
of the perfect crime.

52:11.680 --> 52:14.120
You thought
you could spot
Bobby's tells

52:14.200 --> 52:15.720
but you fatally
misread the situation.

52:18.240 --> 52:20.960
And that's why you murdered
an innocent man.

52:21.040 --> 52:23.160
That's why you
killed the only man
that you ever loved.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.360
This is your fault.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.840
Mine? How could you...

52:33.920 --> 52:36.760
If you hadn't tried to sneak
into Bobby's life...

52:36.840 --> 52:38.720
You killed him.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.160
You stole my father from me

52:40.240 --> 52:42.160
before I even got the chance
to know him.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.760
You could've told me the truth.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.120
Why didn't you?

52:47.360 --> 52:48.640
If you had,

52:48.720 --> 52:50.640
he might still be alive.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.200
Officer Myers,
if you would?

52:52.280 --> 52:53.880
My pleasure. JP?

53:06.240 --> 53:08.880
Thank God this is over.
What an ordeal.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.200
I take it we can go now?

53:10.280 --> 53:11.440
Oh, of course.

53:11.520 --> 53:13.440
Although you understand
we have an obligation

53:13.520 --> 53:14.640
to report your cheating.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.000
Cheating?
What cheating?

53:19.080 --> 53:20.880
Well, let's put it
this way, Les.

53:22.480 --> 53:23.640
It's a shady business.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.040
Huh?

53:29.520 --> 53:32.680
SELWYN: I gather
congratulations are in order.

53:32.760 --> 53:36.040
A satisfyingly swift conclusion
to the Rodrigues murder.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.720
Thank you, Commissioner.

53:37.800 --> 53:40.240
I apologise
for letting you down
last night.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.440
I was busy.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.040
Learning to pull rabbits
out of hats?

53:43.960 --> 53:45.320
So I understand.

53:45.400 --> 53:48.200
Fortunately, your stand-in
rose to the occasion.

53:48.280 --> 53:50.320
SELWYN: In fact,
it is him I want to talk to.

53:50.880 --> 53:53.440
Ah, the very man.

53:53.520 --> 53:54.600
Commissioner.

53:54.680 --> 53:57.000
My niece informs me
you were a great hit

53:57.080 --> 53:58.600
with her ladies last night.

53:58.680 --> 54:00.280
So much so that

54:00.360 --> 54:02.640
they have made request
to have home visits

54:02.720 --> 54:04.600
to check
their security arrangements.

54:04.680 --> 54:05.760
Home visits?

54:05.840 --> 54:08.800
So far,
you have had six requests

54:08.880 --> 54:10.720
but I'm sure there
will be many more.

54:10.800 --> 54:12.240
Here are their addresses.

54:12.320 --> 54:15.440
I trust you will not disappoint
any of them.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.520
No, um, uh...

54:17.600 --> 54:19.160
SELWYN: Your shoes

54:19.240 --> 54:21.160
appear to be
a little soggy.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.320
Oh, I...

54:23.400 --> 54:24.960
I had to go home.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.320
Just a little domestic mishap.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.760
I left my bath running
this morning

54:28.840 --> 54:30.240
and it flooded the whole house.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.240
I wasn't soliciting an anecdote.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.160
I was suggesting
you change your shoes.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.400
Yeah. Commissioner.

54:38.120 --> 54:39.800
Why did you
leave the bath running?

54:39.880 --> 54:41.520
Because I had to leave
my house in a hurry.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.840
There was a madman
sitting outside,
honking his horn.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.760
You should find that man
and give him a piece of your...

54:46.840 --> 54:48.640
Oh, right, you mean...

54:48.720 --> 54:51.560
Yes, it's going to take
at least a week
to dry out completely.

54:51.640 --> 54:54.240
I've got no fridge,
no television, no bed.

54:54.320 --> 54:56.160
Well, listen,
come and stay at the shack.

54:56.240 --> 54:57.720
No, no, no.

54:58.640 --> 55:00.040
I'm sure JP can put me up.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.680
Oh, I'm sorry, Dwayne.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.360
Me and Rosey
only have one bedroom so...

55:05.000 --> 55:06.640
Same here, Dwayne. Sorry.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.080
Well, that settles it, then.

55:08.160 --> 55:10.160
I got you into this mess,
the least I can do
is put you up.

55:10.240 --> 55:12.640
And now that Siobhan's gone,
the spare room has gone

55:12.720 --> 55:14.080
spare.

55:14.160 --> 55:15.960
As long as you don't mind
being around me
24 hours a day.

55:28.920 --> 55:30.920
Glad of the company,
to be honest with you.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.240
Been fairly quiet round here.

55:34.800 --> 55:35.960
I'll just be next door.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.720
Oh, and just to warn you,
apparently I snore,

55:42.800 --> 55:44.120
so you might wanna
get some earplugs.

55:45.080 --> 55:46.160
Lovely.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.080
(GROANS)

55:51.080 --> 55:52.520
(SQUEAKING)

55:54.680 --> 55:55.640
Great.

55:57.640 --> 55:58.760
(SIGHS)

56:00.520 --> 56:02.200
You going
to raise or fold?

56:02.280 --> 56:06.280
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.800
You've never played this game
before in your life,
have you, JP?

56:09.560 --> 56:11.120
(KISSING TEETH)

56:11.200 --> 56:12.480
Have about you, Dwayne?

56:12.560 --> 56:14.120
I'm guessing
you're gonna want to fold, too.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.400
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

56:16.480 --> 56:17.760
No? You pursed your lips.
You got nothing.

56:19.440 --> 56:21.120
But I thought you knew
nothing about poker.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.480
Nah, I don't.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.320
But when you spend
the best part of 15 years

56:24.400 --> 56:27.440
interviewing
the cream of London's
criminal fraternity,

56:27.520 --> 56:29.640
you develop a knack
for spotting tells.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.960
Okay, so what's mine?

56:32.040 --> 56:33.400
You wrinkle your brow.

56:33.480 --> 56:34.920
Yep, just like that.

56:37.360 --> 56:38.560
(GROANS)

56:39.800 --> 56:41.160
DWAYNE: Straight flush?

56:41.240 --> 56:42.520
-How?
-Beginner's luck.

56:44.360 --> 56:46.880
-Mmm-hmm.
-(LAUGHING)

56:51.400 --> 56:52.560
JACK: Wow.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.240
WOMAN: My husband
was murdered yesterday

56:58.320 --> 57:00.000
and I would give
everything I have,

57:00.080 --> 57:02.600
everything, to bring him
back again.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.200
What brought you out
to the island?

57:04.280 --> 57:05.880
Frank. I've always been a fan.

57:05.960 --> 57:07.640
Is that an Irish accent I hear?

57:09.160 --> 57:10.840
Who is Otis Falconer?

57:10.920 --> 57:12.760
It's like he's
never heard of personal space.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.000
He's meant to be my boss.

57:14.080 --> 57:15.680
I may be an agent

57:15.760 --> 57:17.320
but I'm not that ruthless.

57:17.400 --> 57:18.640
You take longer
in the bathroom

57:18.720 --> 57:20.000
than anyone I've ever met.
