00:00.350 --> 00:02.800
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:03.050 --> 00:04.740
- You're Kyle.
- You're in my tub.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.939
We need what he knows.
She's the only one capable of getting it.

00:07.950 --> 00:10.300
I have a feeling we're more
alike than you think.

00:10.350 --> 00:11.800
How sweet is this?

00:11.850 --> 00:14.140
That's awesome. You're awesome.

00:14.150 --> 00:18.500
Kyle, I'd like to introduce you to
the cerebral impulse relay, or C.I.R.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.640
If it can work on him,
we can break through Kyle's firewall.

00:21.650 --> 00:24.440
You can remove the information
that you require.

00:24.450 --> 00:25.700
I just spoke to the police.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.940
They went to Emily's house
to look for Jessi.

00:27.950 --> 00:28.800
She's run away.

00:29.150 --> 00:30.600
He went after her, didn't he?

00:31.150 --> 00:32.940
Hopefully, Kyle can explain.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.240
He's been hiding things,
and you've been helping him.

00:35.250 --> 00:36.900
You lie. You've been lying.

00:37.750 --> 00:38.240
Get out!

00:38.250 --> 00:41.940
All Kyle has ever wanted is
to be a part of your family.

00:41.950 --> 00:43.100
Bring our son home.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.100
I'm leaving tomorrow.

00:45.450 --> 00:46.900
Will you be back in time
to say good-bye?

00:46.950 --> 00:47.800
I wanna be.

00:47.850 --> 00:49.240
- Who is he?
- Adam Baylin.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.040
He knows I'm here. I think
we can communicate with him.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.140
Kyle, stop. She's betrayed you.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.640
I did it. I took what they wanted me to.

00:56.650 --> 00:59.300
- the information.
- You shouldn't have trusted me.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.500
No!

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:10.550 --> 01:11.500
Jessi!

01:13.350 --> 01:14.300
Kyle, no!

01:14.850 --> 01:15.800
What are you doing?

01:16.650 --> 01:18.900
She's already dead!

01:20.650 --> 01:23.000
And you can't bring her back
by killing yourself.

01:25.850 --> 01:26.900
She took it.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.500
- She took what?
- Everything.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.940
All the information in my head.

01:30.950 --> 01:33.300
Everything I got from ZZYZX.

01:35.650 --> 01:37.700
Well, maybe it's best
that it died with her.

01:38.850 --> 01:41.500
No one could have survived
that jump, not even you.

01:41.850 --> 01:44.100
Before today, I didn't think
anyone could survive a gunshot.

01:46.150 --> 01:48.500
Look, I know I owe you an explanation.

01:48.550 --> 01:51.300
This was the plan
from the very beginning,

01:51.450 --> 01:52.940
In case anything happened to Baylin.

01:52.950 --> 01:54.800
He wasn't sure that'd he would
be able to heal himself.

01:55.450 --> 01:57.000
He still might not recover.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.340
But he didn't want me
to get your hopes up unnecessarily.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.300
In case he died.

02:04.850 --> 02:06.400
This is where you went.

02:07.550 --> 02:09.300
When you left and wouldn't tell me.

02:09.350 --> 02:10.800
You came here to take care of him.

02:11.150 --> 02:11.740
Yes.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.040
You were with me the rest of the time.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.200
Was he up here alone?

02:14.350 --> 02:16.040
Members of Latnok looked after him.

02:16.050 --> 02:19.440
Latnok? They still exist?

02:19.450 --> 02:20.300
Yes.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.440
That ring that you wear around your neck,

02:22.450 --> 02:24.040
The box you found at Baylin's,

02:24.050 --> 02:26.740
It all originated from Latnok.

02:26.750 --> 02:29.400
They have Baylin's best interests,
and mine... and yours.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.200
- I wanna see him.
- Not now.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.940
I have to find a safer location.

02:36.950 --> 02:37.640
You need to go home.

02:37.650 --> 02:39.200
But I can help you.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.700
Your family's waiting for you.

02:43.350 --> 02:45.000
It's time for you to tell them the truth.

03:10.050 --> 03:10.700
Hi.

03:11.450 --> 03:12.200
Hi.

03:19.150 --> 03:20.800
I know you have a lot of questions.

03:21.950 --> 03:24.800
I have a lot of answers, and
I'm ready to tell you everything.

03:28.650 --> 03:31.000
None of it changes the way
I feel about all of you.

03:33.450 --> 03:35.700
I hope that it doesn't change
the way you feel about me.

03:48.550 --> 03:51.000
I told them how Adam Baylin created me.

03:52.950 --> 03:55.100
Josh was wrong about me being an alien.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.200
But as far as believing I came
from someplace very different,

03:59.750 --> 04:01.000
He was right on target.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.100
I told them how Foss saved
me from ZZYZX,

04:05.350 --> 04:08.000
Then later returned to destroy
it after Baylin was shot.

04:08.950 --> 04:11.100
I told them how Brian Taylor betrayed us.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.600
How could Nicole have known
that by bringing me into her home,

04:14.950 --> 04:17.600
She had also invited
the danger that would follow me?

04:18.149 --> 04:21.399
I revealed how I enlisted
Declan as the keeper of my secrets.

04:21.850 --> 04:23.300
And while I had gained an ally,

04:23.650 --> 04:25.140
Lori had lost a boyfriend.

04:25.150 --> 04:27.400
So I couldn't help wondering
if I had lost her.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.800
I warned them of the most recent danger.

04:30.950 --> 04:32.300
Madacorp.

04:32.750 --> 04:33.840
How they recruited Stephen

04:33.850 --> 04:35.400
As an unwitting pawn in their game

04:35.850 --> 04:38.100
And their agenda
to get what they wanted from me.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.800
But I saved what
I knew might be the most troubling

04:42.050 --> 04:43.700
I told them all about Jessi.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.100
We already know that Jessi is different,

04:46.650 --> 04:48.400
But she and I are a lot alike.

04:49.150 --> 04:50.800
We were created the same way.

04:51.050 --> 04:52.740
Ballantine programmed her
from the beginning

04:52.750 --> 04:55.140
To get the information
that was inside my head,

04:55.150 --> 04:57.100
The information I got from ZZYZX,

04:59.150 --> 05:00.200
And she did.

05:04.650 --> 05:06.600
And then she jumped
from the edge of the dam,

05:08.250 --> 05:09.500
And I couldn't save her.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.300
And that's it.

05:18.350 --> 05:19.400
That's everything.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.400
That is so much cooler
than anything I've ever dreamed up.

05:40.550 --> 05:43.200
I knew that I'd given
the Tragers a lot to process.

05:43.350 --> 05:45.300
I was anxious to hear their response,

05:45.550 --> 05:49.100
But at the same time, I was afraid
of what that response might be.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.300
Today would be the day I'd know
if I'd have to say good-bye to my family.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.400
But it wasn't the only
good-bye I had to worry about.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.000
- Hello, Kyle.
- Is Amanda home?

06:02.350 --> 06:04.000
She had to fly out this morning.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.500
Orientation at
the conservatory started early.

06:09.350 --> 06:10.600
Sorry you missed her.

06:11.550 --> 06:13.500
I was just hoping
I'd have a chance to say good-bye.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.800
I know. So did she.

06:17.150 --> 06:18.800
Well, I know she'll be amazing.

06:19.650 --> 06:21.600
She's never been anything but.

06:24.150 --> 06:24.900
Thank you.

06:40.950 --> 06:43.300
I didn't get a chance to say I'm sorry.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.000
For everything.

06:47.650 --> 06:49.900
I never meant for any harm
to come to this family.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.500
Something wonderful
happened to this family.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.100
You.

07:09.850 --> 07:12.800
You could never do anything
to make us love you any less.

07:24.850 --> 07:25.640
So what do we do now?

07:25.650 --> 07:29.000
I'll do to Madacorp exactly what I
did to ZZYZX when I was inside the pod.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.540
If Ballantine wants
the information inside my head,

07:31.550 --> 07:33.240
He'll have to put me
in the C.I.R. chair to get it.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.240
But you said you don't
have the information anymore.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.600
But he doesn't know that.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.040
Once I'm in the chair,
I can create an energy surge

07:39.050 --> 07:40.940
That will burn out
all of Madacorp's servers.

07:40.950 --> 07:42.200
Actually, you can't.

07:42.450 --> 07:44.040
The C.I.R. chair's specifically isolated

07:44.050 --> 07:45.500
From the Madacorp mainframe.

07:46.150 --> 07:46.900
But...

07:48.050 --> 07:49.240
I can physically link it.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.340
All I need is a translink
multi-induction cable

07:51.350 --> 07:53.140
And access to the mainframe corridor.

07:53.150 --> 07:55.940
If you can do that,
I'll make sure that Madacorp

07:55.950 --> 07:57.400
Can never do this to anyone again.

07:57.550 --> 07:58.940
Great. When do we start?

07:58.950 --> 08:00.040
As soon as possible.

08:00.050 --> 08:02.640
Not today.
It's the Madacorp open house.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.700
That's right.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.400
It's perfect.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.600
No, really. There'll be
a lot of people there, right?

08:07.850 --> 08:08.340
Yeah.

08:08.350 --> 08:09.700
It'll give us the perfect cover.

08:09.850 --> 08:10.800
Great.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.240
What are the rest of us supposed to do

08:12.250 --> 08:14.300
While you two go storm the castle?

08:18.150 --> 08:21.400
Technology, science, art.

08:21.850 --> 08:24.900
Only one company integrates all three

08:25.150 --> 08:27.200
For the benefit of mankind.

08:28.050 --> 08:28.900
Madacorp...

08:32.049 --> 08:34.600
How are you doing? I mean...

08:35.450 --> 08:37.100
Now that you know all of my secrets.

08:38.549 --> 08:41.900
I got dumped because Declan
wouldn't trust me with your secrets.

08:42.150 --> 08:43.100
Do you know what that means?

08:44.250 --> 08:45.900
This wasn't about me.

08:46.350 --> 08:47.440
It wasn't my fault.

08:47.450 --> 08:50.240
All this time, I've been
worried about what I did wrong

08:50.250 --> 08:51.900
Or what I could have done different.

08:51.950 --> 08:54.200
I couldn't have done
anything because it wasn't me.

08:55.150 --> 08:56.300
I'm free.

08:56.350 --> 08:57.640
- Free?
- Yes!

08:57.650 --> 08:59.940
Free from all the drama
with a capital Declan.

08:59.950 --> 09:03.240
Free from worrying about
anybody else's feelings but my own.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.300
Free.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.300
Thank you for this.

09:07.350 --> 09:09.400
You're... welcome?

09:17.950 --> 09:20.200
Just make sure you and
the kids stay close to the crowd.

09:20.550 --> 09:21.300
We will.

09:21.450 --> 09:23.400
This is the safest place for everyone.

09:23.450 --> 09:25.700
Ballantine won't do anything
with all those witnesses around.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.600
Whoever thought when he hired you,
you'd be his undoing?

09:30.450 --> 09:32.300
I'll be back in 45 minutes.

09:33.450 --> 09:34.600
Good luck.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.940
Okay. So, we know the drill.
Just act normal.

09:44.950 --> 09:47.440
How can I act any another way?
Mom and dad won't tell us anything.

09:47.450 --> 09:49.240
All we have to do is protect the secret.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.500
I know the drill.

09:51.050 --> 09:54.600
Everything Kyle told us, outside
of the family, we can't talk about.

09:54.850 --> 09:55.700
Talk about what?

09:56.850 --> 09:58.200
What are you doing here?

09:58.250 --> 09:59.000
Nice!

09:59.750 --> 10:04.100
This is the Madadork--corp...
Whats it open house, right?

10:05.450 --> 10:08.300
You invited me to this thing,
like, two weeks ago.

10:08.850 --> 10:10.640
Remember? we planned to eat
every piece of food in the place

10:10.650 --> 10:13.040
Cause the chemo's gonna make
me ralph it back up anyway,

10:13.050 --> 10:15.000
And you're totally holding
my hair back when I do.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.100
Wait a minute. What's going on?

10:19.350 --> 10:20.540
What? Nothing.

10:20.550 --> 10:23.000
Right!
I can always tell when you're lying.

10:23.650 --> 10:25.500
I'm not lying. There's nothing going on.

10:26.850 --> 10:28.500
We are so screwed.

10:39.450 --> 10:40.900
I hear you've been looking for me.

10:47.150 --> 10:49.300
I must admit,
I'm a little surprised to see you.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.300
You're a businessman.
I'm here to make a deal.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.000
You have terms?

10:54.750 --> 10:55.700
A proposal.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.500
A trade that mutually
benefits both partners.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.500
So what is it we're placing on the table?

11:01.050 --> 11:03.300
I give you the information inside my head.

11:03.550 --> 11:05.000
You leave my family alone.

11:05.850 --> 11:08.200
You talk like you know
what the information is.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.300
I know it must be valuable
if you've gone to such lengths to get it.

11:12.050 --> 11:12.900
Valuable?

11:14.750 --> 11:16.440
Thank you, Mr. Ballantine.

11:16.450 --> 11:17.800
More like priceless.

11:31.050 --> 11:32.840
Oh, my god.
If this tastes half as good

11:32.850 --> 11:35.800
Coming back up as it
does going down--mmm!

11:44.850 --> 11:46.600
Hey, good to see ya.

11:47.950 --> 11:48.800
What are you doing?

11:49.050 --> 11:50.100
Acting normal.

11:50.450 --> 11:53.200
Well, stop acting normal.
You're freaking kids out.

11:53.350 --> 11:55.300
What normal thing would you
be doing if you weren't...

11:55.450 --> 11:58.400
You know, defending the greatest
secret of the modern world?

11:58.950 --> 12:00.900
Looking for a cute guy to hook up with.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.600
What? I'm free to inspect the hotties.

12:05.050 --> 12:06.640
Lori Trager's open for business.

12:06.650 --> 12:09.200
I'm looking for a little...
customer appreciation.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.600
I've eaten nine pigs in a blanket,

12:11.650 --> 12:14.800
But my stomach can't take
thinking about you doing...

12:15.850 --> 12:16.840
Business.

12:16.850 --> 12:18.640
Well, too bad for you,

12:18.650 --> 12:19.940
Because the next cute guy I see

12:19.950 --> 12:23.100
Is about to have a very
memorable open-house experience.

12:32.650 --> 12:33.800
You gotta be kidding me.

12:39.850 --> 12:41.900
What makes the information so priceless?

12:42.350 --> 12:44.940
20 years of highly
sensitive scientific research,

12:44.950 --> 12:47.000
And you're the only one who has it.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.200
There was no backup?

12:49.850 --> 12:51.640
When you don't want people
to know what you're up to,

12:51.650 --> 12:53.900
You're careful about
how you backup your information.

12:54.050 --> 12:56.400
They, unfortunately,
were a little too careful.

12:57.450 --> 12:58.140
Finally.

12:58.150 --> 12:59.800
I didn't think we'd ever
get to the front of this line.

13:01.850 --> 13:04.000
How does a crepe booth run out of crepes?

13:08.350 --> 13:09.300
Excuse me, sir, sorry.

13:09.650 --> 13:11.440
It's just that you got the last crepe,

13:11.450 --> 13:13.540
And I was in line for so long,
and I really wanted one--

13:13.550 --> 13:15.400
First come, first serve.

13:15.650 --> 13:16.700
I have cancer.

13:26.650 --> 13:28.940
I can't believe you just used
your cancer to get a french pancake.

13:28.950 --> 13:31.200
I can't believe
I didn't use it a long time ago.

13:31.650 --> 13:33.500
Besides, do you know how freeing it is

13:33.550 --> 13:36.200
Not have to keep this big, giant secret?

13:56.050 --> 13:57.500
What do you think you're doing?

14:03.850 --> 14:04.800
Emily.

14:05.850 --> 14:07.900
Making sure the protocols are still online.

14:08.950 --> 14:12.000
Stephen, you have no clue
who you're really dealing with.

14:13.150 --> 14:15.100
Leave now, and I will call security.

14:15.350 --> 14:16.300
I can't do that.

14:17.850 --> 14:20.300
You don't understand.
My family's in danger.

14:21.850 --> 14:24.100
Think about what you would do
if it were your family.

14:26.050 --> 14:27.200
I do understand.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.300
Well, here we are.

14:34.450 --> 14:35.400
So we have a deal.

14:35.850 --> 14:38.200
Well, we would,
but there's just one problem.

14:39.150 --> 14:40.900
You don't have what I want anymore.

14:42.150 --> 14:43.800
But she does.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.500
She survived.

14:54.650 --> 14:57.200
You could call it that,
but she's in a lot of pain.

14:58.850 --> 15:00.840
Information is like
a thouthousand bees

15:00.850 --> 15:03.900
Buzzing around inside her head
trying to fight their way out.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.700
The writing. She's trying
to get it out any way she can.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.800
Well, I can make it easier for her.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.300
It's all right, Jessi.

15:15.050 --> 15:16.500
The men aren't here to hurt you.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.200
Just remember what I promised you.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.500
Jessi, don't do this!

15:21.650 --> 15:23.640
I just want them
to take it out of my head!

15:23.650 --> 15:26.440
Then go with these men.
Everything will be fine.

15:26.450 --> 15:28.240
Jessi, wait!
You can't let him have it.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.800
What could he possibly give
you that would make you do this?

15:38.850 --> 15:41.600
So, now I have my own personal stalker.

15:42.850 --> 15:45.600
Did you plant a tracking chip
on me when I was asleep?

15:46.050 --> 15:47.240
Hillary told me where you were.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.540
Look, I can't explain why,
but it's not safe to be here.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.400
Madacorp is evil. I get it.

15:52.550 --> 15:55.700
Kyle gave us the "previously on" recap.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.400
I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I wanted to.

16:03.650 --> 16:05.540
I hated lying to you,
pretending that I didn't care--

16:05.550 --> 16:06.700
I forgive you.

16:09.950 --> 16:11.200
It's not that easy.

16:11.450 --> 16:12.540
I've learned that sometimes

16:12.550 --> 16:15.100
You have to let go of all
the baggage that weighs you down.

16:17.050 --> 16:18.700
Which clearly you haven't.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.700
Why do you still have all this stuff?

16:23.450 --> 16:24.900
Never got around to tossing it.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.800
Exactly my point.

16:36.850 --> 16:37.600
Try it.

16:40.150 --> 16:42.400
It's the everything but mix you made.

16:42.550 --> 16:44.100
A remnant of the past.

16:45.050 --> 16:46.500
Let's move forward.

16:50.850 --> 16:52.900
Wow. You're right.
That felt really good.

16:53.650 --> 16:55.800
Tickets to that concert we went to.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.300
Mr. Wafflebean.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.400
I won it for you at the carnival.

17:17.050 --> 17:19.200
You think this is a sign?

17:32.350 --> 17:34.900
I am thinking about my family, Stephen.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.500
Something that we both have in common.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.300
Stephen, it's me.

17:51.450 --> 17:53.200
I just checked on the kids,
and they're fine,

17:53.250 --> 17:55.000
But I'm worried about you.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.200
Where are you? it's been over an hour.

17:59.350 --> 18:01.300
Please let me know you're all right.

18:19.950 --> 18:20.940
So, what are you thinking?

18:20.950 --> 18:23.840
More strawberry smoothies
or hit the seafood tower again?

18:23.850 --> 18:25.800
I'm thinking we sneak inside.

18:25.950 --> 18:28.000
There's gotta be some
cool stuff we can steal,

18:28.250 --> 18:29.240
Or at least break.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.000
No, no, no!

18:30.450 --> 18:32.200
That's, like, a really bad idea.

18:32.350 --> 18:33.600
Okay, what's really going on?

18:33.750 --> 18:35.140
You've been acting weird all day.

18:35.150 --> 18:36.500
What aren't you telling me?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.200
Nothing.

18:39.550 --> 18:40.400
Spill it.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.100
Aw... you don't understand.
I can't tell you.

18:44.350 --> 18:46.000
Can't or won't?

18:48.950 --> 18:49.600
Fine.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.700
If you wanna be the guy who keeps
secrets from the girl who has cancer...

18:54.050 --> 18:56.300
I wanted to be
a figure skater until I was ten.

18:56.450 --> 18:59.500
I used to have
an O-Town poster above my bed.

18:59.550 --> 19:02.600
You know those stupid letters
that spell "Josh" on my door?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.940
I put them up,
not my mom like I told you.

19:04.950 --> 19:06.940
I used to try on Lori's training bra,

19:06.950 --> 19:09.100
And one time I took
a measuring tape and...

19:12.850 --> 19:16.000
Are you okay? You look a little...

19:27.950 --> 19:30.100
I guess I'm gonna be
the one holding your hair.

19:38.950 --> 19:39.800
I'm sorry.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.300
They got to me before
I could finish making the connection.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.000
It's almost like they were
expecting something like this.

19:47.450 --> 19:50.200
They were. It was a trap.

19:54.850 --> 19:56.000
Is this what was in your head?

19:57.150 --> 19:58.900
It must be random pieces of it.

19:59.350 --> 20:01.900
When it was in my mind,
it was like a compressed file.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.530
Like my brain compartmentalized it.

20:05.670 --> 20:08.140
Maybe Jessi's mind
doesn't know how to handle it.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.740
Maybe the information wants out,

20:10.750 --> 20:12.330
And she's trying to release it.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.470
Why would Ballantine put Jessi
in the chair to extract it

20:18.240 --> 20:19.800
If she's writing it all out?

20:19.900 --> 20:22.410
Because it would take her
about 57 years to finish.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.720
Do you know what this is?

20:30.080 --> 20:32.060
There's symbols here
I've never seen before.

20:33.810 --> 20:36.440
But based on my memories
of what they were up to at ZZYZX,

20:36.450 --> 20:39.170
I can't let Madacorp
get their hands on any of it.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.140
What's wrong?

20:43.150 --> 20:46.650
It's Jessi. I can sense her.

20:46.770 --> 20:47.870
How?

20:48.480 --> 20:49.650
I've always been able to.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.680
I just didn't realize how
until a few days ago.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.980
It's like we're two wireless computers.

20:54.710 --> 20:56.430
But this is stronger.

20:57.170 --> 20:58.410
What do you mean, stronger?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.490
I think I can connect with her.

21:02.130 --> 21:02.970
From in here?

21:02.980 --> 21:04.410
The more intense Jessi's emotions,

21:04.420 --> 21:05.990
The more pronounced her
brainwaves become.

21:17.870 --> 21:19.930
All right, Jessi,
while we extract the data,

21:19.940 --> 21:22.070
We'll give you the memories
of the life you always wanted.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.240
Jessi, welcome home.
Dinner's almost ready.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.070
I made your favorites.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.660
Spaghetti with mushrooms.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.010
Thanks, mom.

21:55.570 --> 21:57.230
Data's coming through now.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.480
Jessi, would you mind setting
the table for me?

22:34.510 --> 22:36.290
- Sure, mom.
- Thanks.

22:41.990 --> 22:44.690
Don't do it.
Don't give them the information.

22:44.950 --> 22:46.310
Get out of here!

22:51.140 --> 22:52.300
Leave me alone!

22:52.830 --> 22:55.320
Hey, Jess. You gotta check out
this mix I made for you.

22:55.330 --> 22:58.120
I call it
"songs to get felt up by Declan to."

22:58.700 --> 23:00.390
Hey, Jessi, the food's gonna get cold.

23:00.410 --> 23:02.420
Unless Josh eats it all first.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.400
I won't let you take this away from me.

23:05.410 --> 23:07.890
This isn't real, it's an illusion.

23:09.650 --> 23:11.250
In other stories tonight,

23:11.260 --> 23:13.040
Police are still searching for clues

23:13.050 --> 23:14.640
That may shed light on the murder

23:14.650 --> 23:16.740
Of a hunter that
was found in the woods...

23:26.880 --> 23:28.480
Hey, are we going to the rack later?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.180
You can't escape from who you are.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.660
I don't like who I am.

24:06.370 --> 24:09.180
This life is no more real than
the one they gave you with Emily.

24:09.890 --> 24:11.790
They can't make you a better person.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.950
Only you can do that.

24:13.980 --> 24:14.990
How?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.850
By choosing to be a better person.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.100
I never meant to do all
those terrible things I did.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.180
I just wanted them
to take it out of my head.

24:27.190 --> 24:28.250
I know.

24:29.140 --> 24:31.260
This was never
supposed to be your burden.

24:31.510 --> 24:32.890
It was always mine.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.200
I can take the pain away...

24:37.590 --> 24:38.780
If you let me.

25:01.650 --> 25:02.890
What the hell's going on?

25:02.910 --> 25:05.350
- We've lost the data. It's gone.
- Where'd it go?

25:05.360 --> 25:08.930
There was a giant
energy surge in room 237.

25:15.630 --> 25:17.080
You want the information?

25:17.230 --> 25:19.160
You'll have to put me
in the chair to get it.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.780
You can't do it.
It's too big a risk.

25:28.370 --> 25:29.430
He's right.

25:31.590 --> 25:33.080
Kyle, listen to me.

25:33.090 --> 25:34.610
Why would I ever listen to you?

25:34.620 --> 25:37.300
Because if you don't,
you'll destroy yourself.

25:37.310 --> 25:40.320
Don't resist.
Give Ballantine whatever he wants.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.570
I can't do that.

25:43.620 --> 25:46.430
This isn't ZZYZX.
They've taken precautions.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.700
They will not allow you to take over
the system like you did before.

25:49.930 --> 25:51.500
If you try and fight the machine,

25:51.620 --> 25:53.520
It will fry your synapses.

25:53.530 --> 25:56.160
It'll turn that
brilliant brain into charcoal.

25:59.550 --> 26:02.690
Think about everything
that you're meant to do.

26:03.450 --> 26:05.230
Everything that Adam
would have wanted you to do.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.240
Don't you dare mention his name.

26:16.220 --> 26:18.680
He's about to make
the biggest mistake of his life.

26:22.870 --> 26:24.200
What's gonna happen to me?

26:24.450 --> 26:26.130
Don't worry about anything.
It's fine.

26:27.060 --> 26:29.020
- Where are you taking me?
- Jessi, everything's okay.

26:30.190 --> 26:31.250
Please.

26:31.930 --> 26:34.510
Go back the way we came.
Take the elevator to the lobby,

26:34.520 --> 26:36.370
Get the hell out of here. Go!

27:50.470 --> 27:51.930
All systems normal.

27:52.670 --> 27:53.950
Vitals look good.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.130
We're ready, sir.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.470
Begin the extraction.

28:04.930 --> 28:06.510
My god, Jessi! You're okay.

28:10.220 --> 28:11.320
Oh, god.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.460
Jessi, where's Stephen?
Where's Kyle?

28:13.470 --> 28:14.790
They have them.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.440
- I have to go back!
- No! Please!

28:16.450 --> 28:18.630
- I have to help them.
- You can't. It's too late.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.440
Jessi, is there anything you can do?

28:23.450 --> 28:24.470
No!

28:24.500 --> 28:27.230
Jessi, Kyle always believed in you.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.930
He risked everything
trying to help you.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.320
Jessi!

28:36.390 --> 28:38.240
They're still
in his active memories.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.820
Once we get past those,
we can get to the information.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.690
Do it.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.680
Sir, he's on the verge
of cardiac arrest.

29:16.690 --> 29:18.480
- Keep going.
- You'll kill him.

29:18.490 --> 29:19.870
Get him out of here.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.600
Let's go.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.940
The harder I tried
to hold out against the chair,

29:29.180 --> 29:31.580
The more I began to fear
that the chair was winning.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.380
Go to maximum power.

29:36.770 --> 29:38.180
Jessi...

29:47.480 --> 29:49.890
And it threatened to take
everything I held dear.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.160
What are you doing here?

29:59.170 --> 30:00.870
Choosing to be a better person.

30:12.590 --> 30:14.910
This is it. Are you ready?

30:16.130 --> 30:17.260
I'm ready.

30:17.270 --> 30:18.720
Let's end this.

30:34.410 --> 30:36.330
There's some kind of power surge.

30:47.380 --> 30:48.940
Do not do this, Kyle.

31:16.050 --> 31:17.340
Did it work?

31:18.330 --> 31:21.660
I don't know how,
but I think you did it.

31:24.140 --> 31:26.040
Jessi!

31:51.150 --> 31:52.130
Kyle?

31:54.690 --> 31:56.380
Why is it so dark?

31:56.440 --> 31:57.950
We caused a blackout.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.820
The city's been dark for hours.

32:01.350 --> 32:02.730
You brought me here?

32:02.730 --> 32:05.200
Shh. Just rest for now.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.040
It takes a lot out of you.

32:07.310 --> 32:08.780
You seem to be okay.

32:09.190 --> 32:10.790
I've had more practice...

32:11.590 --> 32:13.330
And definitely more training.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.110
But don't worry. We'll work on that.

32:21.570 --> 32:22.790
You know,

32:24.030 --> 32:25.910
I couldn't have done it without you today.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.280
Ballantine will never
know how close he came

32:27.290 --> 32:28.960
To getting what's in my head.

32:28.970 --> 32:31.900
He'd broken through,
but you saved me in the nick of time.

32:33.890 --> 32:35.310
You did a good thing.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.610
It was nice to do
something good for a change.

32:45.310 --> 32:46.830
What's gonna happen to me?

32:47.190 --> 32:49.490
Nicole's looking for
a foster-care placement.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.260
I'm sure she'll find you a good home.

32:51.330 --> 32:52.860
A real one this time.

32:56.550 --> 32:58.370
She's been so kind.

33:00.590 --> 33:04.760
After everything I've done,
you all keep helping me.

33:04.770 --> 33:06.110
I'm happy to do it.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.390
Do you think I'll ever be happy?

33:19.020 --> 33:20.480
She looks happy.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.640
That's not me.

33:24.650 --> 33:26.650
I think it could be you some day.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.590
I'm so sorry for what's happened.

33:37.370 --> 33:39.870
All the feelings I had for you,
and what I did at the dam.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.620
Madacorp was responsible.
None of it was your fault.

33:44.310 --> 33:45.990
That's not who you really are.

33:48.130 --> 33:49.630
You're free.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.490
And so are you.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.820
So everything that was inside my head,
it's gone?

34:01.830 --> 34:04.560
Not gone, just in a safe place.

34:23.409 --> 34:26.199
The city traced the blackout
back to Madacorp.

34:26.949 --> 34:30.969
Seattle's blackout is now our
biggest public relations nightmare.

34:30.980 --> 34:32.840
I've been contacted by the board.

34:33.750 --> 34:35.659
Apparently, Brian Taylor's connections

34:35.670 --> 34:38.429
Go a lot higher than I anticipated.

34:39.969 --> 34:41.570
You already know this.

34:42.139 --> 34:43.860
What I didn't know

34:44.070 --> 34:47.810
Is that you were doing everything
without Madacorp's knowledge.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.969
One thing I learned in Iraq,

34:49.980 --> 34:52.389
You can only fly
under the radar for so long.

34:52.690 --> 34:53.889
Am I to take it, Ms. Hollander,

34:53.900 --> 34:56.460
That you won't be resigning after all?

34:57.070 --> 34:58.920
I've decided to stick around.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.390
You're too soft.

35:07.430 --> 35:08.980
You take things personally.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.570
You don't have
the constitution for my job.

35:12.250 --> 35:15.250
I think you might be surprised
with what I can accomplish.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.960
This is all Baylin's stuff.

35:23.970 --> 35:25.600
He'll be back for it.

35:26.160 --> 35:27.430
Is he gonna be okay?

35:27.640 --> 35:29.470
One day, yeah.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.920
You're leaving, aren't you?

35:33.230 --> 35:34.900
You think I don't need you anymore.

35:35.610 --> 35:36.880
Your family will watch over you,

35:36.890 --> 35:38.910
And they'll help you
with your training.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.700
I don't want to do it without you.

35:43.710 --> 35:47.810
Well, you might not want to,
but... you can.

35:50.530 --> 35:51.810
Where will you go?

35:53.380 --> 35:54.690
I'll be around.

36:01.130 --> 36:02.440
That's everything.

36:17.410 --> 36:20.400
Do you remember what you told me
the night that you brought me back here?

36:21.200 --> 36:23.230
When I thanked you for
everything you'd done for me?

36:24.410 --> 36:25.920
I told you to be worth it.

36:26.380 --> 36:28.400
That's what kept me
going through all this.

36:29.150 --> 36:31.240
With what you've lost in your life,

36:31.530 --> 36:33.690
You still gave everything so
that I could have mine.

36:36.140 --> 36:37.820
I'm gonna work as hard
as I can every day

36:37.830 --> 36:39.390
So that I can be worth it for you.

36:40.710 --> 36:42.000
You already are.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.240
I guess the lights aren't back on
in your neighborhood either.

37:05.620 --> 37:08.560
Yeah. City wide blackout
strikes just as you and I

37:08.570 --> 37:11.360
Are about to take
a trip down route sixty-slut.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.760
Someone's trying to give us a sign.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.640
Not very subtle.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.550
I'd say there was someone out there

37:16.560 --> 37:19.170
Who did not want me
to de-revirginize you.

37:19.340 --> 37:20.470
You know about that?

37:20.480 --> 37:21.560
Are you kidding?

37:21.570 --> 37:23.610
None of the guys at school
have been able to get any

37:23.620 --> 37:25.850
Since revirginization
started sweeping the nation.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.060
You know, the whole purpose of that

37:28.070 --> 37:30.430
Was so that I wouldn't let
"boy drama" run my life anymore.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.720
How'd that go?

37:31.770 --> 37:33.850
So it took a little while to kick in.

37:37.420 --> 37:42.690
But I've had more fun with you
today than I've had all year,

37:42.700 --> 37:45.100
And I think it's because...

37:45.400 --> 37:47.190
I'm finally comfortable
with where we are.

37:48.030 --> 37:49.210
Which is?

37:49.640 --> 37:50.910
Friends.

37:51.740 --> 37:52.630
Friends.

37:52.640 --> 37:55.150
- Without benefits.
- Brutal.

37:57.350 --> 37:59.420
But I think we should make a pact.

37:59.540 --> 38:02.020
If neither of us have met
anyone else by prom,

38:02.900 --> 38:05.050
We can finish what
we started in the car today.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.160
- Yeah?
- Totally.

38:07.990 --> 38:09.550
I think I'll take you up on that.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.350
Please. You'll have
20 bubbleheads lined up by tomorrow.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.760
I don't know about that.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.830
They all have the same thing
working against them.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.380
What's that?

38:17.780 --> 38:19.090
None of them are you.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.460
Later, Trager.

38:31.340 --> 38:32.730
Bye.

38:41.270 --> 38:42.410
You're here.

38:43.550 --> 38:45.220
I thought you'd be in New York by now.

38:45.340 --> 38:46.410
Me, too.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.180
My flight was
already delayed for hours,

38:48.190 --> 38:50.100
And then this crazy blackout happened,

38:50.110 --> 38:51.490
And they cancelled it.

38:52.470 --> 38:53.850
So I'm flying out tomorrow.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.710
Which means I don't have
to leave without saying good-bye.

38:59.060 --> 39:01.360
So it looks like the blackout
was pretty lucky, huh?

39:02.020 --> 39:03.430
I guess you could say that.

39:09.790 --> 39:11.080
Amanda,

39:12.340 --> 39:14.120
I need to talk to you about Jessi.

39:16.630 --> 39:18.110
Do you have feelings for her?

39:18.180 --> 39:19.320
No.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.430
That's all I need to know.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.520
I know how much you care about me.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.010
I see it all over your face.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.300
Is it one of my "Amanda" looks?

39:32.630 --> 39:34.110
You have "Amanda" looks?

39:34.420 --> 39:36.110
Three or four of them, apparently.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.960
The semester will be over
before you know it.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.490
Four months isn't that long.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.240
172,880 minutes.

39:49.150 --> 39:50.440
I'll call.

39:51.150 --> 39:52.650
And text.

39:54.970 --> 39:56.220
And e-mail.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.360
I will, too.

40:02.570 --> 40:04.100
And I'll come back to you.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.660
You promise?

40:07.760 --> 40:09.020
Promise.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.860
Then I know it will happen.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.900
I'm sorry, sir.
Visiting hours are over.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.890
Only family members after hours.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.120
I'm her father.

40:51.420 --> 40:52.610
Hello, Jessi.

40:53.670 --> 40:54.920
How are you feeling?

40:55.090 --> 40:56.470
I heard what you said.

40:57.070 --> 40:58.490
How could you be my father?

41:00.040 --> 41:02.660
It's time you learned the truth
about who you really are.

41:12.500 --> 41:15.140
Um, that's-- that's not me.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.280
She looks like me.

41:17.350 --> 41:18.800
You know who she is.

41:20.370 --> 41:22.410
I'll tell you about her if you like.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.400
How do you know her?

41:29.560 --> 41:30.930
I was there.

41:31.170 --> 41:32.860
I'm the one who took the picture.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.760
Her name was Sara.

41:38.820 --> 41:40.700
I don't think we've had a candlelit
dinner since before the kids were

41:40.710 --> 41:41.880
Born.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.680
It's nice to get back to basics.

41:44.430 --> 41:45.620
Can I help?

41:46.140 --> 41:48.130
Yeah. You can light the candles.

41:49.270 --> 41:51.290
Lori, would you come help me
in the kitchen for a minute?

41:51.490 --> 41:52.720
So how are you feeling?

41:53.310 --> 41:54.550
Fine.

41:56.070 --> 41:57.190
Hey, guys.

42:00.890 --> 42:03.100
I know how hard it must
have been to keep my secret.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.580
Thank you.

42:05.590 --> 42:06.550
Don't thank me.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.440
I barely managed
to make it through one day.

42:10.170 --> 42:12.350
I guess we'll just have
to take it one day at a time, then.

42:24.900 --> 42:26.940
When I was in the chair,
all I could think about

42:26.950 --> 42:29.060
Was losing my memories
of the Tragers,

42:31.600 --> 42:33.770
Memories like the one
we were making right now.

42:38.810 --> 42:40.640
I didn't know what lay ahead for me,

42:41.060 --> 42:43.900
But I knew that I would never
have to face it alone.
