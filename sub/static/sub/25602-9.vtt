00:01.080 --> 00:02.707
LUCY: Previously
on /(/7/joy5...

00:02.800 --> 00:03.903
DUTCH: Hey, Pippin!

00:04.000 --> 00:05.900
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.024
ZEPH: There's a spider
in your brain.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.065
It controls you without
you even knowing it.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.946
It's literally keeping
you alive now.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.297
(SCREAMING)

00:13.640 --> 00:14.709
What do the Hullen
want with kids?

00:14.800 --> 00:16.745
I don't know.
Why did they take Gared?

00:16.840 --> 00:17.909
They think he knew something.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.820
They took him
to be lhterrogatea’.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.785
We're busting out of here.
No. The kids.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.268
No!
Gared!

00:24.360 --> 00:26.544
If we try to save those
kids like this, we're dead.

00:26.640 --> 00:27.902
We have to come back for them.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.547
ZEPH: Why did you /ea ve
the Scarbac/(s?

00:29.640 --> 00:31.824
Faith is like
any type of romance.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.182
You can't love someone

00:33.280 --> 00:35.100
if they don't think
you're worth the truth.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.906
JAQ: Why are
the Hui/en hunting me?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.218
We know The Lady wants you.
We just don't know why.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.697
Before she left,
Delle Seyah gave me this.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.939
I think I could be safe
there with her.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.905
I need to know if
you're gIVIng up on us.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.581
No.
Good.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.829
(GASPING)

00:49.920 --> 00:51.262
Ow! My back!

00:51.360 --> 00:53.499
What is it?
What's happening?

00:57.440 --> 00:59.180
FEMALE A]:
Md you enjoy
Kh/yen ’5 case study

00:59.280 --> 01:01.464
on the chemical properties
of plasma, Seyah?

01:01.560 --> 01:05.144
Definitely not a best-seller. I
hope the sequel has more sex.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.185
The remaining files
from Kh/yen ’5 data purge

01:07.280 --> 01:10.659
contain no references to erotic
Interplay between humans.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.103
Thank gods for study aids.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.987
Seyah, I’m detecting
a breach in the Docking Bay.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.140
A breach?
No one knows I'm here.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.583
Perhaps pirates, scavengers.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.386
It's never housekeeping.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.509
On screen.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.626
Apologies; Seyah, but my camera
feeds have been disabled.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.381
Disabled how?

01:29.480 --> 01:31.789
My security protocols
have been taken ofﬂine.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.620
Well, get them online.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.939
I cannot. AH my subroutines
have been remote/y firewa/led.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.701
So what can you do?

01:38.800 --> 01:40.904
I can tell you my geo/ocators

01:41.000 --> 01:43.821
show mo vement 50 meters
from our current locat/on.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.439
Forty meters.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.339
Thirty meters.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.465
Twenty meters.
Fine.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.779
If you want me, come get me.
Ten meters. Zero meters.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.381
It's your weekend.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.705
This chip
was for emergencies.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.825
And we're cashing it in.
The Lady wants Jaq.

02:12.960 --> 02:16.384
Almost caught him on Telen...
I'm sorry, Jaq?

02:16.480 --> 02:18.664
Yeah, Ozzman
wasn't really a fit.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.660
Little man's like,
100% D'av.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.899
Can't lie for shit,
and gullible as mittens.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.639
He goes by Jaq now.
His choice.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.622
I left Jaq with you
so he'd be safe.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.585
He won't be safe until we kill
The Lady, so until then,

02:31.680 --> 02:33.819
we need to hide him
where she can't find him.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.662
Surprise.
Next time, call ahead.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.188
So you'll protect him?

02:39.720 --> 02:41.347
Just let that bitch
try to take him.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.347
I'll get the rest
of his things.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.269
I thought you were going to
Qresh to take back the Nine.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.181
And I will when Aneela
can rule beside me.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.423
Khlyen told me he kept
safehouses across the J.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.908
If he knew how to get
into greenspace,

02:56.000 --> 02:57.865
he would have hidden
the secret in one of them.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.780
So I've been tracking them
all down since I left.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.440
Westerley, Prodigy,
here on Arkyn.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.908
Khlyen made
a weapon in this lab,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.661
one that could
defeat The Lady.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.744
Hold up, you know about the spore?
(SCOFFS)

03:09.560 --> 03:12.939
One day, Killjoy, yoquaccept
that I know everything.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.987
Here, I've even
done your job for you.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.783
What I found so far.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.142
All of Khlyen's research
on the Green.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.423
Hullen biotech, mostly.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.624
How the plasma
powers their systems.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.099
It's useless now,
now that the Green's frozen.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.063
And the greenspace?

03:37.080 --> 03:41.107
I used to dream of seeing you
hurt like this after Pawter.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.827
But I'll free Aneela.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.109
I promise.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.745
But if you use
a cryopod for a babysitter,

03:57.880 --> 03:59.381
we will have words.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.224
JAQ: Labeling?
I'm the only kid here.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.539
Soldiers get a little OCD
before a mission.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.346
He's totally going
to cry, isn't he?

04:14.480 --> 04:16.823
Like, snot bubble hard.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.024
Keep up your training, okay?

04:20.120 --> 04:22.543
It won't be the same with somebody
else pulling knives on me.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.700
Delle Seyah's pretty handy
with a backstab.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.904
Not every fight's won with
weapons, so learn from her.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.787
And be gentle.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.622
He may be big, but he's
made of marshmallow.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.505
All right, go on, then.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.057
Socks_and underwear
are In your shoes.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.424
Shirts are rolled up
into your pants.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.624
Packing is all
about maximizing space.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.300
Damn it, I forgot a jacket.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.822
Dad, I'll be okay.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.662
Dad.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.338
I was just
getting used to that.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.702
And now you're leaving.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.139
Uh... Something else.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.062
It was the only picture I had.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.219
Don't forget me.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.639
Never

05:30.000 --> 05:31.706
You ready to go,
you little booger?

05:33.040 --> 05:37.465
So, it's Jaq now, is it?

05:37.560 --> 05:38.879
JAQ: Hello, Mother.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.829
Hello, Jaqobis Ozzman Kin Rit.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.137
Yes, ma'am.

05:45.840 --> 05:46.829
Come along, then.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.519
(SIGHS)

06:00.280 --> 06:01.269
You Okay?

06:03.040 --> 06:06.180
Promise me, when you kill The
Lady, you will make it hurt.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.463
A lot.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.505
Right through the heart,
Papa Bear.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.623
(GROANS)

06:13.720 --> 06:16.666
Dutch.
DUTCH: Not again, not again.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.864
What the hells?

06:19.800 --> 06:22.985
It's Aneela.
I think she's breaking.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.700
DUTCH: It started in Utopia.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.183
It was just flashes
ofAneela at first.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.942
Then I coughed blood
a few times.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.019
The scars didn't start
until Telen.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.260
You knew about this?
I asked him not to tell.

06:54.360 --> 06:58.182
We have the spore, a greenpool. We're
so close to defeating The Lady

06:58.280 --> 07:00.544
and rescuing Aneela.
I didn't want to worry you.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.141
Well, my best friend's
spontaneously bleeding,

07:02.240 --> 07:03.741
and my brother's
hiding it from me.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.829
No worries, super chill.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.137
Johnny, I wanted...

07:06.240 --> 07:07.559
Look, lam cool, cool, cool

07:07.640 --> 07:09.301
with you guys being
badasses with benefits,

07:09.400 --> 07:10.503
but what I am not cool with

07:10.600 --> 07:13.546
is you hiding shit
behind my back.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.020
Except for the sex stuff.
Walls are thin enough.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.347
Lucy, send this bioscan
to Zeph.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.783
Maybe she can figure out
whatever the shit it is.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.229
LUCY: Filteen minutes
unt/l we reach the Armada.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.265
Welcome home, Awesome Force.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.679
Last lap, boys.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.347
Now we just need to evict
The RAC's new tenants,

07:30.440 --> 07:31.907
and get us a greenpool.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.264
Take back The RAC.
Sound familiar?

07:34.360 --> 07:36.817
Sequels are the best.
More bang, more boom.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.820
More bow-chicka-wow-wow.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.239
Yeah, but it's always
a bit of a letdown.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.106
Yeah, like,
find a fresh angle already.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.781
Come on.
l/e/ubian lV/ghts 2?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.939
Knights of the Mound Table 3?
Classics.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.302
Porn classics.
Of course.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.788
Regular sequels are terrible.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.179
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

08:02.360 --> 08:04.464
You're goddamn late.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.825
Okay, Dutch is waiting
for us on the bridge.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.582
PIPPIN: Okay, and you're
absolutely, positively,

08:10.680 --> 08:13.240
cross your heart or I will die sure
that all headbutting is off the table?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.339
(sncsns) Because the
last time she saw me,

08:15.440 --> 08:17.146
there was headbutting.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.824
Dutch knows The Lady was controlling
you when you tried to steal Jaq.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.799
But does she know that the
spider went through my mouth?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.302
My mouth, Zeph.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.945
Well, your mouth
is your calling card.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.020
Guilty. (CHUCKLES)
Come on.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.337
If Dutch really thought
you were a threat,

08:35.440 --> 08:36.577
you wouldn't be here.

08:36.680 --> 08:37.942
She's a master assassin.

08:38.040 --> 08:41.988
Yes, assassins. So fun,

08:42.080 --> 08:44.264
lovely people.
I tell you what, um...

08:44.360 --> 08:47.306
lam going to leave you two
to catch up, hang out.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.618
Do all that fun lady stuff
that you do.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.938
And in the meantime,
lam going to find myself

08:52.040 --> 08:54.349
a new identity,
and a new face, okay?

08:54.440 --> 08:55.509
On, Pip?

08:57.080 --> 08:58.297
Do I get a say
in your new face?

08:58.400 --> 08:59.822
Don't say Johnny.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.227
TUR/V: The deal is simple.
Take The RAC;

09:03.400 --> 09:05.300
free the kids.
Kick some green ass.

09:06.160 --> 09:09.106
Now, we know from our recon,
kids are being held here.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.940
The docking bay is here.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.383
So first order of business
IS clearing them a path.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.300
Weej will lead the first wave.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.425
What the hells is a Weej?
A new ship?

09:17.520 --> 09:18.908
Did we get a new ship?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.184
Weej, Turin's pet Hullen.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.545
Aw! It's hard when a younger,
cuter model comes along, huh?

09:24.640 --> 09:26.301
TURIN: You all done, Jaqobis?

09:26.400 --> 09:29.107
As I was saying,
Weej leads first wave.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.839
Hold on, you want to put a
Hullen drone in the vanguard?

09:31.920 --> 09:33.057
These Dolls
are The Lady's slaves.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.787
Trusting one
is mission suicide.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.745
Trusting one is our best shot
at getting inside

09:36.840 --> 09:39.024
without tripping the alarm.
Weej has proved himself.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.337
Don't like it?
Take another Warrant.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.657
Easy.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.949
The Dolls are running regular
kiddie shuttles from Westerley.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.302
We intercept the next one,

09:48.440 --> 09:50.340
swap it out for one of
our Black Root ships.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.499
Weej flies in with
a team of Killjoys.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.659
Once they're inside,
Weej opens the docking bay

09:54.760 --> 09:56.079
for the next wave to follow.
No, no.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.219
John, D'av, and I will
ride point with the Hullen.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.345
I already have a team
trained and prepped.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.987
We can't trust this op
with anyone but the best.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.429
Look, we took The RAC before.
We'll do it again.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.067
Take a walk with me,
Yardeen.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.224
Someone just got called
into the principal's office.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.060
BOTH: Shut up, Fancy.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.539
Undermine me again, and I will kick
your assassin
ass
back to Level One.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.187
Level One? Warrants?

10:17.280 --> 10:19.737
The RAC's gone, Chief. It's
just Hullen and human now.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.341
And my humans
have been training hard

10:21.440 --> 10:23.021
to kick Hullen ass.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.827
You can't just blow in here like you're the
only Killjoy with a dog in this fight.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.182
This is my fight.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.020
My family are the reason
why the Hullen are here.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.224
I don't give a good
greasy fart who started this.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.639
The Hullen took our home.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.540
My Killjoys have earned
the right to take it back.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.540
You know
The RAG has a greenpook.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.700
It's my only way in,
and Aneela's only way out.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.859
I can't risk losing it
to The Lady's control.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.746
And I can't ask my men
to put their lives at risk

10:43.840 --> 10:46.149
to save some nutjob
who blew up three RACs.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.739
These green bastards
are stealing Westy kids,

10:49.840 --> 10:52.024
and we don't know why.
Interstellar won't answer.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.940
The Nine walked away.
We're all that's left.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.986
The Hullen took our home,
but not our goddamn hearts.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.785
Guess a lot's changed
around here.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.149
You have a heart now.
That's new.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.219
I forgot what
a pain in the ass you are.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.589
7'he RAG made you
a hero, Yardeen.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.147
Time to give
someone else a shot.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.697
Mmm... The RAC mostly
just yelled at me.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.069
(SCOFFS)

11:16.160 --> 11:17.946
And some things never change.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.667
I want to kiss you on
your forehead right now.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.466
I will kick you in the box.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.544

11:30.640 --> 11:32.665
I'll let Turin know
the convoy's been captured.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.423
The deal was I take out the
pilots, you get the guards.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.546
Well, if you spent a little less time
making your punches look pretty,

11:39.640 --> 11:40.982
you might have got
a few more in.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.945
Care to put
some money on that?

11:43.040 --> 11:46.385
What's on the table?
When we get to The RAC,

11:46.480 --> 11:49.062
if my Hullen count
beats yours, I get your gun.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.106
All right. Mine beats yours,

11:53.040 --> 11:54.462
I get your ponytail.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.946
You're up, Weej.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.781

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

12:40.600 --> 12:43.467
I'm the only one with the codes to
unlock The RAC's exterior cannons,

12:43.560 --> 12:46.199
so how the hells
did the Hullen gain access?

12:46.280 --> 12:47.986
They didn't.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.463
We talking sabotage?
They got a mole on the inside?

12:50.560 --> 12:52.505
The problem's
definitely outside.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.465
The final reading
from Weej's ship

12:54.560 --> 12:56.221
show that he crashed
into a biophasic shield.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.185
A bioshield?
What the shit is that?

12:58.280 --> 12:59.269
JOHN: Hullen biotech,

12:59.360 --> 13:02.022
it's like an immune system
around The RAC.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.384
It scans your ship.
If it reads you as a virus,

13:04.480 --> 13:06.459
bye-bye go boom.
But Weej was Hullen.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.061
He should have passed
right through.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.185
But_ the undercover
KIIIJOYS weren't.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.142
But there's no way
you could have known.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.559
The Hullen probably
put up a shield

13:14.640 --> 13:16.267
alter Wee ’7 saved
Gated and Pree.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.359
So how do we tear
this bitch down?

13:20.440 --> 13:22.499
Hullen tech is powered
by plasma.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.306
Probably the green that they're
taking out of the Dolls,

13:24.400 --> 13:28.029
so we either need to unplug
it, or punch through it.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.185
Keep me briefed.
Dismissed.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.787
I'm sorry you lost your Weej.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.660
Just tear
the goddamn shield down

13:40.360 --> 13:42.260
so we can bring
the goddamn kids home.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.269

13:45.120 --> 13:47.179
DUTCH: Promise
you won't tell anyone.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.941
Not even Pip.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.302
But he's safe now.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.345
I told you
I deactivated the spider.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.305
Yeah, but I can't have anyone
think these wounds

13:54.400 --> 13:57.301
could compromise the mission,
and before spiderbrain,

13:57.440 --> 13:59.658
Pippen and secrets
didn't play well together.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.660
He's with us now, Dutch.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.309
And Pip caught spider fever
trying to save you, remember?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.061
He even wore a helmet.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.259
We're going to get
that thing out of him,

14:11.360 --> 14:13.385
and Johnnyjust found
a shit ton of data

14:13.480 --> 14:15.141
on Hullen tech
that might help.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.467
Okay-

14:19.080 --> 14:21.389
Enough boy talk.
Show me your boo-boos.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.106
Well, injuries
are surface-only, so yay.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.304
But the cicatrization
IS way too fast.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.859
These scars look years old.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.860
But they started bleeding
a few days ago.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.541
Maybe if you're feeling
Aneela's pain,

14:37.640 --> 14:38.959
you're also healing
like her too.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.463
But the Hullen don't scar.
Nobody scars like that

14:41.560 --> 14:44.142
unless they're being branded
or carved with a laser.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.459
For an ancient bitch, this
Lady sure has a steady hand.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.425
Look how intricate
that is.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.159
It looks more like a tattoo,
or maybe a message.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.707
Or a ransom note.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.347
Find out what it means.

14:56.440 --> 15:01.309
Aneela may be strong, but she's
been hurting a long time.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.146
JOHN: Hullen tech
is biological.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.707
It has to be hacked
on a cellular level,

15:08.800 --> 15:10.665
so using Khlyen's research,
Lucy and I

15:10.760 --> 15:12.660
came up with a badass plan
to beat this bioshield.

15:12.760 --> 15:16.821
With this, the crypto cellular
converter, or Regressor.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.862
Old Lucy found
this dirty beast

15:18.960 --> 15:20.666
in the patent database

15:20.760 --> 15:22.819
LUCY: It connects the user
to mitochondrial memory

15:22.920 --> 15:24.820
to control their DNA.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.297
With your mind!

15:28.800 --> 15:32.827
Yeah, a kookypants geneticist built
it to cure hereditary disorders.

from curly to straight.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.784

Smart.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.189
Yeah, except
for the seizures.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.623
Short bursts are harmless,
but prolonged exposure?

15:41.720 --> 15:43.347
Super ouchie.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.180
How will it take down
the shield?

15:45.280 --> 15:48.226
LUCY: If we patch the Regressor to
the plasmas Zeph siphoned from Wee],

15:48.320 --> 15:50.629
it should allow John to control
the shields long enough

15:50.760 --> 15:53.547
for our ships
to pass through unharmed.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.817
Until the seizures.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.866
Yeah, but the buzz before
is supposed to be amazing.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.346
The only prototype
is stashed here, on Leith.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.064
When Dr. Kookypants died, Kookypants Jr.
started a Koolqpants compound.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.425
They use it to keep their members
nicely brainwashed and super cult-y.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.900
Cult-y like witches?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.627

Ooh.

was Scarback.

Foreskin stretcher.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.417
Works for nipples too.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.786
This is a shadow scar.
It's the language of our dead.

16:42.880 --> 16:47.146
Every Scarback creates their own to
be carved on their body at death.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.264
That's cheerful.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.426
These were carved on Dutch
from the inside.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.937
We think The Lady is sending
some sort of message.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.541
And using
the Scarback's language

16:55.640 --> 16:57.779
as a Speak-and-Slice feels
like The Lady's wheelhouse.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.937
Why are the ancient entities
so stabbily-ever-after?

17:01.080 --> 17:04.060

or a clean line of code.

are stories.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.982

17:18.760 --> 17:20.785
FAIRUZA: Each symbol is
one of three, see?

17:21.600 --> 17:23.500
This one is "ascend"
or "evolve."

17:23.600 --> 17:25.625
This one is "elixir."

17:25.720 --> 17:29.986
This is "disappear"
or "dissolve."

17:30.080 --> 17:31.866
Together, they form
a new meaning,

died with the Scarback.

She showed me her scars. They're
from Aneela, not The Lady.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.666
She's telling me
how to get into the green.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.741
(PANTING)
"Ascend, elixir, dissolve."

22:07.720 --> 22:10.280
Why is The Lady tattooing
Dutch with shitty haikus?

22:10.520 --> 22:13.341
(GRUNTS)
How is this even science?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.547
(BOTH MOANING)

22:19.600 --> 22:21.659
I need more bloodflow
to the brain.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.387
Are you cool
to hang me upside down?

22:24.480 --> 22:26.220
Like we practiced?
Yeah.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.344
Yeah.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.429
(LAUGHS)

22:29.080 --> 22:30.581
(BOTH PANTING)

22:30.680 --> 22:31.669
Wow.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.542
Shit, I got nothing.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.789
Huh?

22:37.600 --> 22:39.261
(5R0 A/vs, EXCL/VMS)

22:39.360 --> 22:41.578
You know, Little Pip's
going to need a bit of time

22:41.680 --> 22:43.500
before the thinking caps
go back on.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.144
(BOTH SIGH)

22:47.520 --> 22:49.385
Why do you wear that?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.781
You know it's for
the Madelaines, right?

22:52.880 --> 22:56.702
Those freaky farmers on Leith
with the bonnets and the babies.

22:56.800 --> 23:01.146
Yeah, also known
as my family of origin.

23:01.240 --> 23:04.300
Shit, I'm... I'm sorry.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.701
No, it's fine.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.184
That's why I don't do
relationships with dudes.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.708
Look, I know that the deal was
banging buddies only, but...

23:17.080 --> 23:20.140
I just want to know you.
Can we just talk?

23:20.240 --> 23:23.027
Will talking about my sisters
being traded like cows

23:23.120 --> 23:25.065
or how fun it is
to be shunned,

23:26.080 --> 23:27.741
will that make it better?

23:28.960 --> 23:32.862
And if everything I want
and everything I choose

23:32.960 --> 23:37.101
is just some vestige of
trauma, what gets to be mine?

23:37.200 --> 23:42.866
When do I stop being a victim
and get to be the authentic me?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.780
And that's why
I chose to claim it.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.787
And if you don't respect
that, then, well...

23:53.880 --> 23:55.541
I guess you don't respect me.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.699
No, I do.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.720
And I know it's
a lot to ask, but...

24:04.000 --> 24:06.104
Can you respect
that this is hard for me?

24:08.280 --> 24:10.305
And that I'm trying?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.660
We'll find a middle.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.861
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

24:27.200 --> 24:28.747
Middle is good.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.900
DUTCH: Now that we have
the Regressor,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.740
we can punch a hole
through the shield,

24:35.840 --> 24:37.660
free the kids,
and steal the greenpool.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.639
Once I plug in, I'll control the shield
long enough for our ships to pass through.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.621
But if you're stuck on the other side
when it goes back up, you're SOL.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.142
So we go in hard,
and move fast.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.026
Why can't you just
bring the damn thing down?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.680
Because our brains _aren't
de5igned to speak microcell.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.109
The longer I'm plugged in, the
bigger chance my brain melts.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.588
Might be an improvement.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.937
Or bring me down
to your level.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.382
I'll put both of you
in the corner.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.779
Once John gives the all-clear, Gared
and I will head for the kids,

25:00.880 --> 25:03.257
get them on our ship,
and make for Westerley.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.146
Fancy and I are
diversionary detail,

25:05.240 --> 25:06.946
keeping the Hullen away from
Gared, Pree, and Dutch.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.257
I'll use the vents
to get to the greenpool,

25:08.400 --> 25:09.947
throw the transponder
into the pool

25:10.040 --> 25:11.940
so that Lucy can port it back
to the Armada,

25:12.040 --> 25:14.827
then meet up with Fancy and D'avin.
Circle back to the ship.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.707
Zeph thinks I can keep the
shield open for about 30 minutes

25:17.800 --> 25:19.506
before my brain
starts to reject the tech.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.703
All right.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.299
What are you waiting for?
A written invitation?

25:26.400 --> 25:27.788
Corsage?

25:28.040 --> 25:30.304
Uh...
More like your order.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.664
Technically, you're the boss.
Technically.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.825
It's more politeness, really.

25:34.920 --> 25:35.944
Ceremonial.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.099
Like a figurehead.
No real power.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.827
You're fired, all of you.

Hey, what do you think?

25:48.160 --> 25:49.741
I really wanted something
that would accentuate

25:49.840 --> 25:50.829
my lack of body mass.

25:50.920 --> 25:51.909
You're not going.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.706
I kind of am.
No, you can't go, I'm...

25:53.800 --> 25:55.347
You're not_ the boss of me.
I'm not saying I'm the boss...

25:55.680 --> 25:57.500
La, la, la, la, la...
Hey, listen.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.386
You don't have to prove yourself.
I know you're brave.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.425
Yeah, with you.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.021
Sure, sometimes.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.259
But I think it's about time
I tried the whole

26:05.360 --> 26:07.669
brave thing solo.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.660
Look, I can do the whole

26:09.760 --> 26:13.867
"I'm dying, not really living"
thing, or...

26:13.960 --> 26:16.417
I can dress up like a mime,
go rescue a bunch of kids

26:16.520 --> 26:19.080
from the world's
worst sleepover.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.381
With you and Johnny
staying behind,

26:21.480 --> 26:24.142
someone's got to be
the designated geek.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.461
Okay, okay.
Windpipe's crushing.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.380
Okay, um...

26:34.480 --> 26:36.141
Promise me you'll ride
with Dutch.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.544
No, not a chance.
The woman hates me.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.629
But she owes me,

26:39.720 --> 26:42.462
and she won't let you go unless
she can spider-watch you.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.461
That's racist.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.222
On the plus side, an unstoppable
assassin makes a really good bodyguard.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.503
You are very wise,
Zephyr of Leith.

26:54.200 --> 26:58.421

33:02.880 --> 33:05.303
The RAC's system,
it'll see it as a virus

33:05.400 --> 33:06.617
and respond with a hard reboot

33:06.720 --> 33:08.381
to keep the ship
from imploding.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.380
But the shield's down.
Why isn't that a good thing?

33:12.560 --> 33:15.347
Because a hard reboot
is very, very bad.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.021
Why?
Because the Hullen

33:17.120 --> 33:20.226
will finally be able to access
The RAC's heavy cannon.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.147
(TRILLING) Their weapons
systems are powering up now.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.980
JOH/V: With the green
crystallized on the Armada,

33:25.080 --> 33:27.901
we can't raise the shields
or get out of range.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.706
We're. . .
Perfect targets.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.467
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

33:39.640 --> 33:41.346
RAC guns are online in ten.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.340
I want everyone
on a ship in five.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.624
G0, 90, 90, 90-
That means you too, Jaqobis.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.177
What are you doing? The RAC will
just blast them out of the slq.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.840
Better than waiting for them to
drop an anvil on our nutsacks.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.501
Can we take out
the cannons on our end?

33:52.600 --> 33:54.909
There are four of us.
We'll never get 'em all off

33:55.000 --> 33:56.319
before they
take down the Armada.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.823
Well, can't you hack something?
Not in ten minutes.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.899
The RAC systems are protected
by Hydraic firewalls.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.786
You crack one,
two more pop up.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.302
You crack two,
it quadruples.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.259
So we take the old girl down.

34:07.360 --> 34:08.748
No, we don't have
enough firepower.

34:08.840 --> 34:12.788
TU
RI/V: lVo, d/pshit; we use my master
code and blow it out of the sky.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.587
Bitch of it is, code has
to be entered manually,

34:15.680 --> 34:19.821
so whoever punches it in
punches his own ticket.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.979
One of you ain ’t coming back.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.304
I'll do it.
Like hells you will.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.021
I'll do it.
What about Jaq?

34:26.120 --> 34:27.382
You promised.

34:27.480 --> 34:28.981
(SCOFFS) I'll do it.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.627
Just so I don't have
to watch this.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.666
No, I got
the shortest straw.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.462
Look, whenever RAC
arises from these ashes,

34:36.560 --> 34:38.300
it's going to need Killjoys.

34:39.720 --> 34:41.460
And a designated asshole.

34:42.640 --> 34:45.097
And it's okay.
I know I'm a dead man walking.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.588
That doesn't scare me.

34:46.680 --> 34:50.901
The thing that put a spider
in my brain, that does.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.707
And I know that you guys are the
only ones that can stop it.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.983
DUTCH: Pm.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.421
I can%,Zeth.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.387
Will never forgive herself
when she can't save me,

35:01.400 --> 35:05.587
but she will get over
me dying to save you.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.099
Thank you for your service,
soldier.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.303
(CHUCKLES)

35:21.440 --> 35:23.658
Yeah, not a hugger.
That checks out.

35:23.760 --> 35:26.547
TUR/V: Downloading the code
to your PDD now.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.147
We're all with you, Pip.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.386
Shit...

35:37.480 --> 35:39.300
JOHN: You can stop, Zeph.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.822
I'll port the cube
onto the cargo hold,

35:40.920 --> 35:43.024
so if we go down,
it won't be for nothing.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.900
Wait, what do you mean, stop?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.423
Turin's using
the auto-destruct codes.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.420
But those have
to be entered manually.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.261
Dutch?

35:58.520 --> 35:59.657
No.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.599
Fancy?

36:06.040 --> 36:08.543
No, no.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.621
Pip?

36:12.320 --> 36:14.902
DUTCH: We ’re clear, P/p.
She’s all yours.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.748
ZEPHI
P/p?

36:19.320 --> 36:20.503
(SIGHS)

36:21.000 --> 36:22.342
I was wondering
when you'd call.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.509
I want you
to get out of there,

36:23.600 --> 36:24.988
and I want you to do it now,
do you hear me?

36:25.120 --> 36:26.906
Then The RA C
would blow you up,

36:27.000 --> 36:28.661
and I'm not cool with that.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.705
Why are you doing this, Pip?

36:31.560 --> 36:35.064
Because if I didn't, then I'd
probably never get laid again.

36:36.960 --> 36:40.509
But I haven't figured out
how to get into the green yet.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.704
We have so much
thinking to do.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.660
Just find Dutch.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.399
She 7/ get you out;
she ’5 magic.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.744
We scientists _
don't believe in magic.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.827
I will
if it'll bring you back.

36:54.920 --> 36:58.617
You ’re looking at this
the wrong way, Zephyr.

36:58.720 --> 37:01.359
A genius farm girl from Leith

37:01.440 --> 37:05.706
almost falling for a spoiled
loudmouth from Qresh?

37:09.600 --> 37:12.023
Hells if that ain't magic.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.457
(SHUDDERING) Pip?

37:16.280 --> 37:18.066
L...

37:18.160 --> 37:19.707
(CRYING)

37:22.680 --> 37:24.944
It's okay, Zeph.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.621
I know.

37:28.720 --> 37:29.937
(KEYPAD BEEPS)

37:30.040 --> 37:32.144
(ALARM BLARING)

37:37.800 --> 37:39.586
Meet me in the middle.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.267
Pip?

37:47.800 --> 37:48.983
P/p?

38:04.600 --> 38:06.420
Good-bye, old girl.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.985
(CRYING)

38:21.080 --> 38:22.547
JOHN: Okay,
that's all three of us.

38:23.680 --> 38:24.817
DUTCH: How are you feeling?

38:24.920 --> 38:25.909
D'AVIN: About as good
as you can feel

38:26.000 --> 38:28.423
after you have a piece
of your brain removed.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.580
The only way to keep Jaq safe was
to make a Remnant of his location.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.906
The Lady can't steal
what we don't remember.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.985
I promised not to forget him.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.183
How many promises will I have
to break to keep him safe?

38:41.160 --> 38:42.661
Let's destroy it.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.266
Jaq will find me
when it's over.

38:45.360 --> 38:49.581
Once Zeph decodes Aneela's
scars, we'll end all of this.

38:49.720 --> 38:54.259
About that. I need to
speak With Dutch alone.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.980
The floor is all yours.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.939
Here's everything
I found on the scars.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.861
Definitions, etymology of
"ascend, elixir, disappear."

39:09.920 --> 39:12.627
But if it's a way into
greenspace, I don't know how.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.222
But Aneela wouldn't send them
if they weren't the key.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.026
Well, I put some of
my working theories on there

39:18.120 --> 39:19.382
as a springboard for John.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.300
John?

39:21.400 --> 39:22.947
Zeph, we need you.

39:23.040 --> 39:26.624
Tell_ him to look_into how
caterpillars liquefy in a cocoon.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.706
They retain their memories
even as they change form.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.219
It was his choice, Zeph.

39:33.320 --> 39:37.541
Pip makes terrible life choices.
Everyone knows that.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.025
You know what they say about
Team Awesome Force?

39:45.040 --> 39:49.659
They say D'av
will take the bullet,

39:49.760 --> 39:53.059
John will fix what's broken,

39:53.200 --> 39:55.384
and Dutch will bring you home.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.107
You were supposed
to bring him home.

the parents are happy.

Ugh.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.119
Taking a breather.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.225
I'm not really her

41:10.680 --> 41:11.783

was trying to say.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.262
"Ascend, elixir, dissolve."

41:34.520 --> 41:37.500
Aneela wasn'tjust
telling me how to get in.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.146
She was telling me
how to let her out...

41:41.080 --> 41:42.149
What did you do?

41:45.240 --> 41:47.379
You're the thief
who saved my life.
