WEBVTT

00:08.009 --> 00:09.760
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.844 --> 00:12.513
Dr Wilkes has designed
a containment chamber

00:12.638 --> 00:13.723
to stabilise himself,

00:13.806 --> 00:15.433
<i>but he needs a sample of Zero Matter.</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:17.143
<i>I intend to get that sample
from Whitney Frost.</i>

00:17.226 --> 00:19.687
<i>I think the reason for your visit
is pretty obvious.</i>

00:19.812 --> 00:20.896
You need my help.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.524
The necklace is equipped
with a tracking device.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.651
You'll be obtaining a blood sample
from Miss Frost.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.653
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

00:27.737 --> 00:29.405
Thank you
for agreeing to this meeting.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.032
Without further ado, my wife.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.617
Cal, what's going on?

00:34.410 --> 00:35.953
Whitney, please.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.204
I trusted you.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.416
Violet, um, broke off the engagement.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.376
- What?
- Peggy, she broke it off with me

00:42.460 --> 00:43.878
because she thinks I'm in love with you.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.131
Miss Underwood.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.799
<i>Dottie Underwood
gave us the slip.</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:50.259
<i>As long as she's unaccounted for,</i>

00:50.342 --> 00:52.553
<i>there's no way to calculate
how many lives are in danger.</i>

01:16.869 --> 01:20.289
<i>Before I begin,
I would first like to thank</i>

01:20.372 --> 01:25.002
<i>my wonderful fans
and my dear, dear studio family</i>

01:25.086 --> 01:28.422
<i>for their unwavering
support of me at this terrible time.</i>

01:29.465 --> 01:31.842
<i>It means more to me
than you will ever know.</i>

01:32.218 --> 01:34.261
<i>Last night, at midnight,</i>

01:34.720 --> 01:38.390
<i>my beloved husband,
Calvin Chadwick,</i>

01:38.891 --> 01:40.768
<i>along with several of his colleagues...</i>

01:41.852 --> 01:43.604
<i>Perished at sea...</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:49.318
<i>...when their boat sank
off of Catalina Island.</i>

01:50.736 --> 01:52.613
Gosh, she's a really good actress.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.365
Oh, please, if I could spit, I would.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.493
- She killed them.
- And half the Council.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.663
And no one questions her story
for one moment.

02:06.585 --> 02:09.004
<i>But there is one thing that I know.</i>

02:09.547 --> 02:12.133
<i>I will not be broken by this tragedy.</i>

02:12.925 --> 02:16.011
<i>I will come through this
stronger than ever.</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:20.182
<i>And that I promise you.</i>

02:22.601 --> 02:25.146
<i>Thank you. Thank you all.</i>

02:25.229 --> 02:26.647
Wait, wait! Miss Frost!

02:26.730 --> 02:28.149
Miss Frost!

02:28.232 --> 02:29.441
Please, Miss Frost!

02:29.608 --> 02:31.068
Something happened at that fundraiser.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.778
Chadwick must have turned
against her.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.989
Do you think she killed
Dottie Underwood, too?

02:35.072 --> 02:36.407
Dottie's nothing if not a survivor.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.410
I won't believe any stories of her demise
until I see a dead body before me.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.162
And even then, I might not believe it.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.622
If Whitney truly is a genius,
then she'll know

02:43.706 --> 02:45.749
that Dottie's of more worth to her
alive than dead.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.917
We must find her, Daniel.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.294
Didn't know you cared so much.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.629
I'm the reason why
she was set loose in the first place.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.090
Whitney will try and use her
against us if she can.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.218
Mr Jarvis is trying to fix the
transponder link to Dottie's necklace.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.428
I'll check his progress.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.679
Let me know what you find out.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.598
And, uh...

03:00.931 --> 03:02.391
Then we should probably

03:03.642 --> 03:04.935
talk.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.645
Yes, great.

03:06.729 --> 03:07.855
- About things.
- Yes.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.231
- Great.
- Mmm!

03:11.275 --> 03:13.194
- Good.
- Yep.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.171
How romantic.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.548
It's our first date.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.508
Oh, don't be frightened.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.803
I'm hoping that we can avoid
any unpleasantness today.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.723
There's nothing
you have in that little box

03:42.890 --> 03:46.810
that will do anything
other than bore me to tears.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.354
We'll see.

03:50.356 --> 03:53.067
Oh... Ilse Koch.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.237
The witch of Buchenwald.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.030
Your mother?

03:59.573 --> 04:00.658
No.

04:01.075 --> 04:04.828
The wife of a
Nazi concentration-camp commander.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.538
She...

04:07.456 --> 04:09.208
Liked to kill prisoners

04:09.708 --> 04:13.671
and skin the tattoos off their bodies
as a souvenir.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.464
Charming.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.675
I interrogated her
after she was captured.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.927
In less than 24 hours,

04:20.010 --> 04:22.096
she told me everything
I wanted to know.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.684
And this was an
especially persuasive tool.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.695
I've pulled out my own teeth...

04:39.071 --> 04:40.489
My own nails...

04:41.240 --> 04:42.700
My own hair.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.328
I've burnt my own flesh
with a blowtorch.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.081
I'm no Nazi harlot.

04:50.082 --> 04:53.294
And you are wasting my time.

04:55.004 --> 04:57.548
What is Peggy Carter looking for?

05:00.718 --> 05:01.969
Look at you.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.807
You're trying to act ruthless,
but you're terrified.

05:08.183 --> 05:11.937
Afraid of that pretty blonde monster
holding your leash.

05:17.443 --> 05:18.902
Truth serum?

05:20.237 --> 05:21.572
You can't be serious.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.626
Like mother's milk.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.259
Easy does it.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.683
Is that right?

05:50.309 --> 05:52.061
Yes. Very good.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.146
Now what?

05:54.563 --> 05:55.939
Connect the cables...

05:56.607 --> 05:58.817
And hope we don't blow out
the entire Los Angeles power grid.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.612
And then we can try it.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.782
Dr Wilkes?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.912
Dr Wilkes, stay with me.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.417
It's happening more frequently.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.419
I know.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.381
Have you finished?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.049
Nearly.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.425
We're running out of time.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.429
How are you?

06:29.556 --> 06:30.849
You want an honest answer?

06:32.142 --> 06:34.603
At this moment,
no, not particularly.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.773
I'm doing great.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.943
I believe...

06:41.193 --> 06:42.361
I've done it.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.738
Oh! Yes, uh...

06:46.448 --> 06:47.533
Ah!

06:51.370 --> 06:53.247
The transponder is repaired.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.957
Behold.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.334
Your hidden talents know no bounds,
Mr Jarvis.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.336
Oh, one doesn't spend years
in the company of Howard Stark

06:59.420 --> 07:01.964
without picking up a thing or two
about electrical engineering.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.465
Lucky you didn't pick up the clap.

07:03.549 --> 07:04.758
Anything?

07:06.176 --> 07:08.387
No signal from
Miss Underwood's necklace.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.931
It could've been
deactivated or destroyed.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.642
Or she could be out of range.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.310
Perhaps we could expand the signal.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.020
Can you get us to a higher elevation?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.148
I believe Mr Stark
has a dirigible in the pool house.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.357
Why?

07:21.400 --> 07:23.318
She's a Russian spy, a murderer.

07:23.819 --> 07:27.156
Why mount a rescue for someone who'd
kill you the moment she was able?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.992
I agree, Dottie is despicable,

07:30.075 --> 07:31.368
but she was acting under my orders.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.828
So this is about saving yourself.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.124
Dottie is my responsibility.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.877
I wouldn't abandon her or anyone else
to the likes of Whitney Frost.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.295
Don't abandon her.

07:42.254 --> 07:45.090
The kill switch on that necklace
is attached to a different circuit.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.217
Activate it and be done with her.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.470
Jason, I understand
you are under considerable...

07:49.553 --> 07:52.514
You understand nothing!
This isn't simply about my death.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.100
I am facing much worse than that.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.733
I'm... I'm sorry.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.985
I'm... Not thinking straight.

08:05.777 --> 08:06.904
I'm sorry.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.947
- Jason...
- Ana, we should get back to work.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.747
Go on. Ask me another one.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.208
You're really close to breaking me.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.628
You're every bit as formidable
as I've heard, Miss Underwood.

08:23.295 --> 08:24.671
Aren't you sweet.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.549
Not as smart
as you think you are, though.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.135
Dr Fennhoff...

08:31.386 --> 08:32.888
He certainly got your goat.

08:33.722 --> 08:34.890
Yeah.

08:35.641 --> 08:37.559
I read all about that fiasco.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.146
Tricked into helping
a crazy, old Russian

08:41.230 --> 08:44.733
with his revenge fantasy
against Howard Stark.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.694
Huge embarrassment to Leviathan.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.613
And Stalin?

08:50.239 --> 08:53.909
Well, he's not exactly the forgiving type.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.912
You know nothing about it.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.331
I know you're
as good as dead to Russia.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.877
Girl without a country,
an assassin without a target...

09:04.169 --> 09:05.420
Bet I could find a target.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.798
...all alone in the world.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.175
And you know the worst parts for you?

09:10.676 --> 09:14.846
You actually believe that
you've got a friend in Peggy Carter...

09:15.722 --> 09:18.684
A woman that would see you hanged
if she could arrange it.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.644
It's pathetic.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.479
I almost feel sorry for you.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.111
Your presence is requested.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.738
I'm busy!

09:32.614 --> 09:34.032
You want I should tell her that?

09:45.377 --> 09:48.839
Miss Frost, I was
on the verge of getting her to talk.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.592
Oh, I highly doubt that, Vernon.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.429
In any event,
I have another task for you.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.514
I could go for some grappa.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.434
Whitney? Vern? No?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.227
All right, more for me.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.315
I fail to see the necessity
of Mr Manfredi's involvement.

10:06.398 --> 10:09.026
Joseph is providing security...

10:09.901 --> 10:11.069
For the new council.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.322
My men are much more capable
of handling that.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.615
I trust him.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.451
And his men actually follow his orders.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.161
That's true. It's very true.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.789
Your only focus now
should be finding the uranium rods

10:23.081 --> 10:24.833
that Peggy Carter stole from me.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.251
That's not necessary.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.712
Isodyne can make new rods.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.422
- Might take a little time...
- No!

10:31.298 --> 10:34.384
I need the same rods
from the original test.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.802
Do you understand me?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.096
This is your priority, Vernon.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.600
You can use
any and all means necessary.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.902
You look as lovely as ever, my dear.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.573
And what about Dottie Underwood?

10:57.741 --> 10:59.034
I'll talk to her.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.079
I have a feeling
this needs a woman's touch.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.473
You know, I'm not
in the movie business,

11:21.556 --> 11:25.227
but I think you're gonna need
a lot more makeup to cover that up.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.440
Well, I've moved on
from that part of my life.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.402
It's taken too much from me
for far too long.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.778
Hmm.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.823
My childhood, my innocence.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.077
You know what that's like.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.996
I can see it in your eyes.

11:45.831 --> 11:46.957
Yes.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.712
We're so much alike.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.340
Let me tell you all my secrets.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.136
I feel just from talking to you
for a few moments,

11:59.219 --> 12:02.556
we're...
We're absolutely in the same boat.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.189
Oh...

12:14.234 --> 12:15.736
We're not in the same boat.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.157
We're not even in the same ocean.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.665
What a finely crafted piece.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.836
I disabled the tracking device
when you arrived.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.050
So don't expect Peggy Carter
to come and rescue you.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.360
Now that we understand each other,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.696
what does Peggy Carter want?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.406
You.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.575
No! Don't! Please! Please...

13:03.784 --> 13:05.994
She told me to get
a sample of your blood...

13:06.244 --> 13:08.538
A sample of whatever that is inside you.

13:09.331 --> 13:10.499
And did you get it?

13:12.709 --> 13:13.835
Ooh...

13:13.919 --> 13:15.962
Clever girl.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.631
Why does she want it?

13:18.048 --> 13:19.591
For her new boyfriend.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.968
- He's a scientist.
- Stark.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.804
Wilkes.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.305
No, that's not possible.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.265
- Wilkes is dead.
- He's a ghost.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.017
Things pass right through him.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.229
Molecular intangibility.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.233
Oh! Fascinating.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.528
Oh, Dottie.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.746
Congratulations, Miss Underwood.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.373
You're still useful to me.

14:07.764 --> 14:08.849
Are you ready?

14:10.642 --> 14:11.726
No.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.646
Splendid.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.735
It worked.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.529
It worked!

15:04.696 --> 15:05.906
Wonderful!

15:06.531 --> 15:07.782
Congratulations, Doctor.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.467
Sorry.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.303
- It's been a long time coming.
- Uh...

15:28.929 --> 15:30.722
It's quite, um...

15:31.514 --> 15:32.641
It's quite all right.

15:36.895 --> 15:37.979
Um...

15:39.689 --> 15:41.066
Uh, you know what else?

15:41.566 --> 15:42.609
What?

15:42.692 --> 15:44.235
I am starving.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.446
Of course you are.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.948
You haven't eaten in days.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.075
I shall make you a meal fit for a king...

15:50.158 --> 15:51.660
A true Hungarian feast.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.119
Oh!

15:53.662 --> 15:55.205
I've never had Hungarian food before.

15:55.664 --> 15:56.790
Is it any good?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.210
Eh.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.712
Well, I am sure that I will love it.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.549
We have a signal.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.184
Sousa.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.435
<i>We've located Dottie.</i>

16:17.644 --> 16:20.230
She's in the Santa Clarita valley
near a town called Newhall.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.606
Interesting.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.775
And the machine that Dr Wilkes built
is working.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.568
<i>He's back in the material world again.</i>

16:26.653 --> 16:28.071
That's great news.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.990
How quickly can you get here?

16:30.365 --> 16:33.201
Oh, gee, Mother,
I'd really like to come visit,

16:33.284 --> 16:34.911
but I'm a little busy right now.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.039
Vernon Masters is there.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.667
Yes, Mother, I'm getting enough sleep.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.502
<i>What can I do to help?</i>

16:42.711 --> 16:44.087
No, everything's great.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.047
I'll talk to you soon.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.882
Bye.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.676
Sorry about that.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.469
You know mothers.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.972
Count your lucky stars
that she's still among us.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.561
How's your new post, Chief Sousa?

17:00.311 --> 17:03.189
Getting all the resources
and support that you need?

17:03.314 --> 17:04.524
Absolutely.

17:04.899 --> 17:06.317
You sure about that?

17:07.736 --> 17:09.279
'Cause I've been
led to believe otherwise.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.990
I don't follow.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.868
There's been a theft, Chief.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.578
On your watch.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.789
And I'm not talking
about office supplies.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.626
This is highly volatile
radioactive material.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.504
Uranium, stolen from Roxxon.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.758
And you need to find it.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.266
Unfortunately,
Daniel's dealing with Vernon Masters.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.435
He won't be coming. Are you ready?

17:40.685 --> 17:42.520
Miss Carter, do you not feel

17:42.604 --> 17:45.023
that the sudden and inexplicable
appearance of this signal is...

17:45.231 --> 17:46.524
Rather convenient?

17:47.275 --> 17:48.943
It isn't inexplicable, Mr Jarvis.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.946
We're walking into a trap.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.283
Oh...

17:58.286 --> 17:59.954
Do you plan on baking biscuits
along the way?

18:00.038 --> 18:01.247
No.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.500
But this may just save our bacon.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.793
Good. I quite fancy my bacon.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.921
Allow me to present...

18:09.047 --> 18:12.258
The jitterbug.
A nonlethal concussive device

18:12.342 --> 18:14.886
with a blast field of 170 degrees.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.263
Howard couldn't spring
for the other 190 degrees?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.099
When we waltz into this trap,

18:19.432 --> 18:21.601
I believe we may be outnumbered.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.353
I believe we can count on it.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.563
If or when that happens,

18:25.688 --> 18:30.276
you will want
to stand behind me, like so,

18:30.735 --> 18:35.573
then I simply enter the sequence...

18:38.660 --> 18:39.744
And...

18:43.665 --> 18:45.875
We watch our assailants cut a rug.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.085
As it were.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.090
Darling...

18:53.883 --> 18:55.885
- May I make a suggestion?
- Of course.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.471
I thought a darker jacket
more befitting a prowler.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.349
You're quite right. Thank you.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.775
Is everything all right?

19:11.484 --> 19:12.610
Yes.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.404
Of course.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.367
You're worried.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.203
I can assure you,
Miss Carter is more than capable

19:22.287 --> 19:24.038
of handling whatever lies ahead for us.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.915
I'm not worried about her.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.003
- If you would rather I didn't go, I...
- No.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.629
She needs you.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.340
And I can see how much you need this.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.677
So I can permit you your adventure,
Mr Jarvis.

19:38.553 --> 19:41.514
But you must also allow me
to wring my hands from time to time.

19:47.478 --> 19:50.064
I promise you, no harm will come to me
under Miss Carter's watch.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.775
Don't make promises you can't keep.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.570
Ready, Mr Jarvis?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.238
Yes, he is.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.200
Let's see what
Miss Frost has planned for us.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.707
Let me get this straight.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.835
You're telling me Roxxon has known
about this heist for the past 48 hours.

20:10.919 --> 20:11.961
They're just now coming to us?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.630
- Trail is ice-cold.
- I agree with you.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.965
Whoever pulled off this job is talented.

20:16.341 --> 20:19.552
But I believe
that you are smarter than they are.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.346
Thanks.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.265
Still, can't make any promises.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.809
Can I call you "Daniel"?

20:27.393 --> 20:29.103
Yeah. I'd like that.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.022
You have a great story, Daniel.

20:31.856 --> 20:35.151
From war hero
to exemplary agent to Chief.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.197
And this is not just
about talent or intelligence.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.866
Yours is a tale of sacrifice.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.619
Let this be your next chapter.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.956
It might be difficult
to clean up this Roxxon business.

20:48.039 --> 20:51.000
It's gonna cost you time, money.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.753
Hell, you might even lose a few friends.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.381
But the rewards, Daniel...

20:57.465 --> 20:59.050
These folks in Washington,

20:59.133 --> 21:02.220
they love a hero,
and they love a good yarn.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.642
Well, I'm not a hero.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.770
And I'm not here to add to my story.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.857
Like I said, we'll do our best.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.819
But I wouldn't get my hopes up.

21:21.364 --> 21:24.993
Well, I guess I'll just
keep my expectations...

21:25.952 --> 21:27.537
Realistic, huh?

21:38.214 --> 21:40.967
The Chadwick ranch
is five miles beyond the next canyon.

21:43.678 --> 21:47.265
Well, I'm very pleased to be entering
into this buoyed by Dr Wilkes' success.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.225
Very exciting, indeed.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.935
Absolutely.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.359
I must say, I don't think
I've ever seen him quite so...

21:59.736 --> 22:01.029
Excited.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.075
Unsafe.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.910
Do you have
something to say, Mr Jarvis,

22:07.994 --> 22:09.620
instead of pecking around
like an old mother hen?

22:09.704 --> 22:10.872
No.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.582
I was simply trying to fill silence.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.791
Well, don't feel the need.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.252
I like the silence. Keeps me
focused on the task at hand.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.587
Understood.

22:19.630 --> 22:20.882
It was a very exciting moment.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.425
He kissed me. I indulged him.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.344
Yes.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.554
And blushed.

22:26.637 --> 22:27.805
I beg your pardon!

22:27.889 --> 22:29.015
You blushed.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.392
I am not discussing this with you
any further, Mr Jarvis.

22:32.060 --> 22:36.064
Though this does create a bit of a sticky
wicket in regards to Chief Sousa.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.107
A sticky what?

22:39.150 --> 22:42.570
It's... It's just that I've noticed
something of a connection, as it were.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.197
Between the two of you.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.784
I fail to see how
this is any of your business, Mr Jarvis.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.786
And now that
his engagement has been called off...

22:50.411 --> 22:52.038
You were eavesdropping
on our conversation in the van!

22:52.121 --> 22:53.664
I would never.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.461
I may have overheard
a private utterance or two.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.671
If you are implying
that I am some sort of chippy

23:00.755 --> 23:02.256
toying with two men that I respect,
you...

23:02.340 --> 23:03.925
The thought never crossed my mind.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.096
However...

23:09.055 --> 23:11.057
You have rather gone
from famine to feast,

23:11.140 --> 23:12.642
vis-à-vis quality suitors.

23:13.643 --> 23:16.229
And I must say,
I do not envy your position.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.816
Between Dr Wilkes' incandescent smile

23:20.566 --> 23:22.902
and Chief Sousa's eyes,
so warm yet so wise.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.404
No. No, no. Please, please. No!

23:29.742 --> 23:32.620
I never intended to encourage
the affections of two...

23:33.454 --> 23:35.081
Quality suitors, as you say.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.626
It simply happened.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.964
You underestimate your allure,
Miss Carter.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.591
I'm not in the least surprised.

23:47.677 --> 23:48.845
I am.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.016
I don't know what to do.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.650
Stop right there.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.863
Now, who the hell are you?

24:49.113 --> 24:50.198
Me?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.408
I'm just the distraction.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.868
What?

24:56.496 --> 24:58.289
Heard a shot! This way!

24:58.998 --> 25:00.166
Over here!

25:00.249 --> 25:01.626
Behind me.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.836
Don't move!

25:03.920 --> 25:05.421
- Mr Jarvis.
- Not yet.

25:05.505 --> 25:06.756
They're almost upon us.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.091
And... Now!

25:09.342 --> 25:11.093
33-23-33.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.054
I've got them covered. Watch them.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.515
33-23-33.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.558
Drop your weapons!

25:18.643 --> 25:19.977
33-23-33.

25:20.061 --> 25:22.438
You move one more inch,
it'll be your last.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.398
What shall we do now?

25:25.191 --> 25:26.859
Well, there's only one thing to do.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.240
Let's go.

25:34.534 --> 25:35.952
Peggy.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.913
Is this supposed to be a rescue?

25:41.374 --> 25:43.251
What a nice surprise.

25:49.674 --> 25:50.925
Mmm!

25:52.760 --> 25:56.514
Ana, please tell Mr Jarvis
that he is a very lucky man.

25:57.515 --> 26:00.059
I'll be sure to send him the message.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.527
- I feel born again.
- Hmm.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.281
<i>- Salud!
- L'chaim!</i>

26:13.864 --> 26:17.451
To Agent Carter and Mr Jarvis
and their safe return.

26:25.626 --> 26:26.961
Where is Whitney Frost?

26:27.753 --> 26:29.380
You want information from me?

26:29.463 --> 26:32.633
After you sent me on a fool's errand
to collect a blood sample?

26:33.050 --> 26:35.595
If I'd had any other choice,
you'd still be rotting in your cell.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.973
And yet you risked life and limb
to try and rescue me.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.725
Did anyone question you?

26:40.808 --> 26:43.185
Your friend Vernon. We had a chat.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.605
Lovely cocktail party
with sodium amytal,

26:45.688 --> 26:47.565
and he threatened to pull my teeth out.

26:47.982 --> 26:52.153
33... 23... 33.

26:53.029 --> 26:54.572
What did you tell him?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.115
Not a thing.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.241
I know I put in the correct sequence.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.244
33-23-33.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.292
Oh, you better hurry, Peggy.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.712
If I get loose before you do,
there's no telling what I'll do.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.718
Are you all right?

27:17.887 --> 27:19.263
Careful what you ask me.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.892
I've had just enough wine
that I may answer honestly.

27:23.517 --> 27:26.604
If you want to talk,
I'm not going anywhere.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.657
Well...

27:41.535 --> 27:44.497
When Edwin told me about
his previous exploits with Miss Carter,

27:45.122 --> 27:47.750
he didn't want me to know
what dangers he faced.

27:48.793 --> 27:51.754
Sometimes we lie
to protect those that we love.

27:51.837 --> 27:52.963
Yes.

27:53.464 --> 27:54.715
I know.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.594
I find that now, I miss the lie.

28:03.474 --> 28:06.185
But today, we have much to celebrate.

28:07.561 --> 28:10.523
Now that you're whole again,
what is your next step?

28:12.858 --> 28:14.902
Well... That's the thing.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.946
I... I don't know.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.033
Even before all this happened,

28:21.117 --> 28:23.953
all of Isodyne's resources
were focused upon Zero Matter.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.874
We were still 10 years away
from unravelling its basic principles.

28:29.583 --> 28:30.918
Ten years?

28:32.253 --> 28:34.213
Mmm-hmm.

28:36.006 --> 28:37.258
Hmm...

28:40.469 --> 28:44.098
Look at us,
just crying into our $400 bottles of wine.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.893
Would you like
to cry into a $1,000 bottle?

28:50.938 --> 28:53.023
33-23-33.

28:53.691 --> 28:55.109
What happened to you?

28:55.860 --> 28:56.944
33...

28:57.069 --> 28:59.196
What's your plan for me
once all this is over?

28:59.280 --> 29:00.865
Put you back in prison, of course.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.324
- Really?
- 33-23-33...

29:02.825 --> 29:05.077
You'd save me
only to sentence me to death?

29:05.161 --> 29:06.871
Don't be dramatic.

29:07.580 --> 29:12.501
I'm being a realist,
which is a concept you need to accept.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.920
You stick that pretty little head of yours
in the sand,

29:15.004 --> 29:17.548
all the while knowing
what kind of men you work for.

29:17.631 --> 29:19.300
Like Vernon Masters.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.218
I'll deal with Vernon Masters.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.180
He's only one of many.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.516
Do you have any idea how
deep the rot goes in the SSR?

29:27.641 --> 29:29.059
33-23-33...

29:29.393 --> 29:31.812
Your idealism blinds you, Peggy.

29:31.979 --> 29:33.314
And it will kill us all.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.485
Freedom.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.278
Carole Lombard.

29:40.196 --> 29:43.240
The code for the device
was set to 34-24-34,

29:43.324 --> 29:44.408
Carole Lombard's measurements.

29:44.492 --> 29:47.578
Like a fool, I accidentally put in
Barbara Stanwyck's measurements,

29:47.661 --> 29:50.790
33-23-33,
which is a completely different function.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.917
- What does Barbara Stanwyck do?
- What does Barbara Stanwyck do?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.668
Well, naturally, that's the code for...

30:02.676 --> 30:04.345
The delayed detonation.

30:09.183 --> 30:11.268
Six men here, no Whitney Frost.

30:11.352 --> 30:12.812
They're all broken.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.480
I was looking forward
to having a little fun.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.149
You're in no condition to have any fun.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.651
What did they do to you?

30:18.943 --> 30:22.446
I told you, your friend Vernon
played rough when he questioned me.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.031
And yet no one questioned us.

30:24.198 --> 30:26.534
And so they locked us away
for hours. Why?

30:27.451 --> 30:29.078
Perhaps they are awaiting
Miss Frost's return.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.249
Vernon didn't do this to you.
Whitney Frost did.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.793
What did you tell her?

30:36.794 --> 30:39.755
Peggy, you knew this was a trap.

30:39.964 --> 30:41.215
Of course.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.467
But it wasn't set for you.

30:45.553 --> 30:46.887
Jason.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.305
Ana.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.897
Move. Now!

31:05.322 --> 31:07.449
<i>Halt. You are trespassing.</i>

31:07.741 --> 31:09.326
<i>Leave the premises immediately,</i>

31:09.410 --> 31:11.871
<i>or the proper authorities
will be contacted.</i>

31:12.371 --> 31:14.498
<i>Halt. You are trespassing.</i>

31:14.832 --> 31:16.417
<i>Leave the premises immediately,</i>

31:16.500 --> 31:18.878
<i>or the proper authorities
will be contacted.</i>

31:19.503 --> 31:21.005
<i>- Cease your activities at once.</i>
- Quiet, dear.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.257
<i>You have five seconds to comply.</i>

31:24.049 --> 31:26.844
<i>4, 3, 2...</i>

31:27.469 --> 31:29.013
<i>Wonderful!</i>

31:29.889 --> 31:32.224
<i>Enjoy the poinsettia garden
outside the east wing</i>

31:32.600 --> 31:34.351
<i>and have a very pleasant day.</i>

31:42.693 --> 31:45.112
Isometric heat-waste
regulators.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.783
Ah, kinetic force stabilisation.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.412
Mobile solar energy collectors...

31:54.955 --> 31:56.999
What, is he
constructing a palladium core?

31:57.833 --> 31:59.460
The man's a certifiable genius.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.004
He wants to waste it on making movies.

32:02.463 --> 32:03.505
What a shame.

32:03.881 --> 32:05.424
What are you doing here?

32:05.758 --> 32:07.134
Dr Wilkes.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.306
The last time we saw each other...

32:14.350 --> 32:15.976
That was quite an evening, wasn't it?

32:23.484 --> 32:25.027
I'm impressed.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.823
To design all this by yourself...

32:32.159 --> 32:34.662
You are very special, Dr Wilkes.

32:35.412 --> 32:38.582
Isn't it marvellous, the Zero Matter?

32:39.375 --> 32:43.462
Retaining its base property while
affecting each host differently, hmm.

32:45.214 --> 32:46.674
Like the two of us.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.052
Both fascinating in our own way.

32:52.346 --> 32:53.764
Peggy will be back soon.

32:53.931 --> 32:55.432
Mmm...

32:55.516 --> 32:57.142
I think we have a little time.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.401
Now, what happens
if you step out of this?

33:05.818 --> 33:07.403
Do you lose all mass?

33:07.695 --> 33:09.905
Where do you go
if you're no longer contained?

33:12.992 --> 33:14.785
Listen to me, chattering away.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.537
I didn't come here to talk.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.415
Your friend stole something from me,

33:19.999 --> 33:21.500
and I need to take it back.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.678
What are you doing? Dr Wilkes.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.471
Stop!

33:40.644 --> 33:42.146
Oh!

33:42.229 --> 33:44.606
You are full of surprises, Doctor.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.291
I've never seen you like this before.

34:03.459 --> 34:04.668
Like what?

34:05.461 --> 34:06.712
Scared.

34:13.135 --> 34:14.553
I'm not gonna lie.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.805
That stung a little.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.016
How did you do it?

34:20.309 --> 34:21.602
I have no idea.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.438
Well, do you feel different?

34:24.938 --> 34:25.981
Stronger?

34:28.025 --> 34:29.693
Get out of here!

34:31.820 --> 34:33.822
You are stronger, Dr Wilkes.

34:34.323 --> 34:35.949
You don't need that contraption at all.

34:38.202 --> 34:39.745
But it doesn't last, does it?

34:40.829 --> 34:44.166
That machine was designed
to contain Zero Matter,

34:44.500 --> 34:46.085
which contains you.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.544
Come with me.

34:47.628 --> 34:49.129
- What? No.
- Yes. Yes.

34:49.213 --> 34:51.465
We both need Zero Matter.
We can help each other.

34:52.049 --> 34:54.968
We can help each other understand it.
We can help each other control it.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.763
You can't control it. No one can.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.515
It's a force of destruction.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.266
Look at what it's done to me, to you.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.851
We can change the world.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.229
The world's just fine as it is.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.107
Is it?

35:08.982 --> 35:12.444
Do you... Do you really believe
that Isodyne recruited you

35:12.820 --> 35:14.947
because they valued
your brilliant mind?

35:16.365 --> 35:19.451
You were hired for the same reason
that Jane Scott was hired.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.412
A woman and a coloured man.

35:23.163 --> 35:27.084
We're people so marginalized,
so desperate for approval,

35:27.167 --> 35:29.419
we'll do anything to hold on
to what little respect we can get.

35:30.295 --> 35:33.882
Easily manipulated
and completely expendable.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.050
Yeah, from what I hear,

35:35.134 --> 35:37.886
your husband had a real special reason
for hiring Jane Scott.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.931
But without Isodyne...
Where would you be?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.058
Would you be scrubbing toilets?

35:43.392 --> 35:44.852
Shining shoes for a living?

35:45.561 --> 35:48.647
Has there ever been a day where
you felt like a real man in this country?

35:49.565 --> 35:52.025
I simply want
to change things for people like us,

35:52.609 --> 35:56.947
people that have been ignored,
held back, ground up.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.449
Aw, that's my little Robin Hood.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.579
A coloured scientist.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.791
I done seen everything.

36:07.875 --> 36:08.959
Watch your mouth.

36:09.168 --> 36:13.172
Dr Wilkes, meet my associate,
Joseph Manfredi.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.177
You get what you need, sweetheart?

36:18.468 --> 36:19.678
Not everything.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.639
Dr Wilkes will be accompanying us.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.641
No. No, I won't.

36:25.142 --> 36:26.894
No offence, Doc...

36:27.686 --> 36:30.439
But I wouldn't take that tone with me.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.192
If you think...

36:33.775 --> 36:34.985
Nice shot.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.241
Stark residence.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.285
Mrs Jarvis, this is Daniel Sousa.
They back yet?

36:43.827 --> 36:44.912
No.

36:45.412 --> 36:47.206
<i>And I must admit,
I'm starting to get worried.</i>

36:47.289 --> 36:48.582
Sit tight. I'll be right there.

36:50.626 --> 36:51.960
Watch yourself.

37:05.933 --> 37:08.101
Stand him up!

37:08.393 --> 37:09.853
You want to be a hero, huh?

37:25.702 --> 37:26.828
Let him go!

37:29.206 --> 37:31.667
No. No, no.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.627
That's not necessary.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.255
We're not monsters.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.423
I don't think this concerns you.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.634
He will die if you take him. He needs...

37:40.717 --> 37:41.927
He needs answers.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.387
And I'm gonna help him get those.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.681
You won't get away with this.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.266
She won't stop coming for you.

37:50.394 --> 37:51.687
I don't doubt that.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.981
I can, however, slow her down.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.609
We got to go. Got to go.

38:03.407 --> 38:05.659
Ana! Ana!

38:07.244 --> 38:08.370
Ana!

38:08.453 --> 38:10.247
Oh, are you all right?

38:10.330 --> 38:11.832
Help! Help!

38:21.675 --> 38:23.635
- Help! Please!
- What happened?

38:24.177 --> 38:25.387
She's been shot.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.932
Officer, over here. Agent Carter, SSR.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.600
I have a prisoner
in the trunk of this vehicle.

38:30.684 --> 38:32.102
Don't listen to her if she speaks to you,

38:32.185 --> 38:33.562
and for the love of God,
don't open the trunk.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.771
Let's go!

38:34.855 --> 38:36.606
- Please help her.
- Grab the doors.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.493
Her breathing
is shallow. Pulse is dropping.

38:48.577 --> 38:49.995
Miss, can you hear me?

38:50.329 --> 38:52.247
What's her name, sir? Sir?

38:52.956 --> 38:54.374
Ana Jarvis.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.668
It was a robbery gone wrong.
She was shot once at close range.

38:56.752 --> 38:58.754
- Have OR 1 prepped for surgery.
- Yes, Doctor.

39:00.213 --> 39:02.215
I'm sorry. You'll have to wait here.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.890
Help! Somebody help!

39:09.973 --> 39:11.391
An officer's been shot!

39:14.936 --> 39:16.063
This way.

39:56.228 --> 39:59.022
Geez, Chief, what happened?
Are you all right?

40:07.864 --> 40:09.157
Rough night?

40:10.659 --> 40:11.993
Surprised a couple of burglars.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.831
They objected to being shown the door.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.458
- The crime in this city, huh?
- Yeah.

40:18.792 --> 40:19.835
Crime.

40:21.128 --> 40:23.004
Any leads on the Roxxon materials?

40:23.463 --> 40:24.589
Not a thing.

40:25.799 --> 40:27.175
I don't think we'll ever find it.

40:28.969 --> 40:31.138
That would be a real shame.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.141
For everyone involved.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.102
You know what you need?

40:38.270 --> 40:40.105
A nice, long rest.

40:40.939 --> 40:45.193
I'll be taking over SSR L.A. Operations
for the foreseeable future.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.154
At least until you're back on your feet.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.739
Not necessary.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.493
I think it is.

41:07.591 --> 41:09.134
<i>Auerbach Theatrical Agency.</i>

41:09.551 --> 41:11.428
It's Agent Carter.
Put me through to the Chief, please.

41:11.511 --> 41:12.804
<i>One moment.</i>

41:16.600 --> 41:17.934
<i>Hello? Vernon Masters.</i>

41:19.644 --> 41:20.854
<i>Hello?</i>

41:43.210 --> 41:44.586
She's still in surgery.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.386
They can't even say if she'll...
