WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.692
What the hell are you doing?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.394
Trying to figure out
what this thing's for.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.662
But... Yeah, I got it.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.433
It's not a bottle opener, you
caveman, it's a piece of art.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.568
That? No, it's not.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.370
I'm not doing this.
I am hosting a salon

00:36.404 --> 00:38.372
for the junior board of the Met
tomorrow night, so please,

00:38.406 --> 00:40.941
just drink yourself into a coma
on the early side.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.743
Absolutely not. No.
Get a bunch of hair everywhere?

00:42.776 --> 00:43.844
I don't think so.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.546
Not a hair salon, dingus.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.382
A salon is an intellectual
gathering of young tastemakers.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.050
I dare you to say something
more pretentious.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.352
(chuckles)
Hey, Mickey, check it out.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.853
-It kind of looks like balls.
-Oh, yeah.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.622
(laughs):
Absolutely, looks like balls.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.957
-It's a heart. -No,
that's a bottle-opening scrotum.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.792
Why do you even care
about this crap?

00:58.826 --> 01:00.027
Because a seat opened up
on their board.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.095
This is my chance to get in

01:01.129 --> 01:02.396
with the elite art community.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.064
Oh. You're social climbing.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.266
Okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.401
-Alba, hit me.
-Okay. Uh, art deco.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.902
Art deco. A pastiche
of many different styles,

01:08.936 --> 01:10.304
sometimes contradictory,

01:10.338 --> 01:12.240
united by an effort
to be modern. Art deco.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.874
-Yeah. Nailed it.
-Nice.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.943
All right. Uh, how'd you get
roped into this?

01:15.976 --> 01:18.112
Oh. She's giving me
diamond earrings.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.114
Oh, you're social climbing.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.815
Nice. At least she admits it.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.784
Oh, there's no shame in it.
(chuckles)

01:23.817 --> 01:25.786
Mickey, can you make Totsi
a cup of coffee?

01:25.819 --> 01:28.055
What the hell is a Totsi
and what's it doing in my house?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.923
-Not your house.
-BEN: Totsi's my friend.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.293
He's got snakes for hair,
and a blue belt in karate.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.961
Almost purple.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.396
Smart. With a name like Totsi,
you're gonna need

01:35.429 --> 01:36.664
to know how to fight.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.799
I was named
after an African king.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.269
Oh, yeah? Mickey was named
after a malt liquor.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.836
I take my coffee black.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.672
Oh, well, I'm not a barista.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.574
Mickey, please. He's my friend.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.576
All right, fine.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.811
I'll make you
a cup of coffee, Totsi.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.613
But only because
you're a friend of Ben's,

01:52.646 --> 01:54.682
and I have
the utmost respect...

01:54.715 --> 01:56.217
Are-are you...? Is he...?

02:01.054 --> 02:03.491
(laughing):
Dad! I...

02:03.524 --> 02:05.259
-I mean, Mr. Buckley.
-I see athleticism

02:05.293 --> 02:06.794
hasn't skipped a generation.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.696
You watched my practice.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.830
The end of it.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.265
Listen, um,

02:11.299 --> 02:14.134
I feel bad about what happened.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.370
Uh, but you got to understand,

02:16.404 --> 02:18.672
you went on a date
with your sister.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.508
J-Just so you know,
I never whipped it out...

02:20.541 --> 02:22.510
Yeah, that's-that's in
the past. It's in the past.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.011
-Okay.
-The point is,

02:24.044 --> 02:25.145
if you're still interested,

02:25.179 --> 02:27.381
I'd love to hang out sometime.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.283
I'm free right now.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.384
Well, I can't right now.
I'm going on

02:30.418 --> 02:31.519
a business trip to Maine.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.854
Yeah. That-that...

02:33.887 --> 02:35.856
Super... that's super chill.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.829
You know what? Uh...

02:41.862 --> 02:43.897
How'd you like to tag along?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.366
Are you kidding me? Yes. Yes.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.736
Y-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.771
Okay.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.343
What are you doing out here?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.211
Totsi's meditating.
He didn't want me to interrupt

02:57.245 --> 02:58.646
his breath cycle.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.180
Why do you hang out
with that clown?

03:00.214 --> 03:02.015
Because he's cool,
and hanging out with him

03:02.049 --> 03:03.150
makes me cool.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.152
All right. Buddy...

03:05.185 --> 03:08.088
I want to tell you
that being cool isn't important,

03:08.121 --> 03:10.924
but I'm not gonna say that
'cause it's not true, you know?

03:10.958 --> 03:13.093
Being cool is-is very,
very important, but I'm sure

03:13.126 --> 03:15.696
there are other things that
are more important than that.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.998
-Like what?
-Ooh...

03:18.031 --> 03:19.600
Yeah, I don't know,
nothing's coming to mind.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.934
You want to go check on Totsi?

03:20.968 --> 03:23.871
Yo, Sting. Hot coffee,
coming at you.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.273
How was your meditation?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.540
Gorgeous.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.942
I suffered, I learned,
I changed.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.578
You were upstairs
for four minutes.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.347
Is this instant coffee?

03:33.381 --> 03:35.449
Nope. Freshly brewed.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.550
I don't believe you.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.685
Show me the beans.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.886
I'm not showing you my beans.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.120
'Cause there are no beans.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.389
There's loads of beans, okay?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.123
I don't need to explain
my beans to you. What...?

03:43.156 --> 03:45.359
Oh, are you serious? All right,
that's it, you're done.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.594
-Come on, I'm taking you home.
-But Aunt Mickey!

03:46.627 --> 03:48.128
No. It's for his own good.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.463
Have a little talk
with your mom.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.931
See if I can't cram him
back inside of her,

03:50.964 --> 03:52.800
and then kick her
down a flight of stairs.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.039
When you said
that we were flying,

03:59.072 --> 04:01.909
I didn't realize
that you would be flying us.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.911
It's the Buckley way.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.447
Talk about soaring like a bird.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.549
What?

04:08.582 --> 04:11.419
It's... because we're as high as
a bird, but going twice as fast.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.121
Hey, do me a favor, take the
controls for a second, will you?

04:15.155 --> 04:17.725
Go ahead.

04:17.758 --> 04:18.859
(chuckles)

04:20.628 --> 04:22.730
-(engine sputters)
-(shouts)

04:22.763 --> 04:24.898
-Oh, oh!
-(screaming)

04:24.932 --> 04:26.300
We're going down!
Brace yourself!

04:26.334 --> 04:29.102
-(laughing)
-(screaming, laughing)

04:29.136 --> 04:30.471
(chuckles)

04:30.504 --> 04:32.940
I'm just messing with you, kid.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.007
Oh, that's funny.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.676
You're a funny guy. You got me.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.945
Ah...

04:37.978 --> 04:39.947
(sighs)

04:39.980 --> 04:41.148
So-so where are we headed?

04:41.181 --> 04:42.450
Where-where are we staying?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.318
Great outdoors, my boy.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.253
We're testing a whole bunch
of brand-new camping equipment

04:46.286 --> 04:47.855
for my store.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.324
You don't mind
a little camping, do you?

04:50.358 --> 04:52.025
Are you kidding me?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.562
I frickin' love camping.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.710
I can't wait to meet
the demon who spawned you.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.279
Hi, sweetie!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.014
Hi.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.716
I'm Jennie.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.318
(quietly):
Garth.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.791
Oh, I am freaking out!
(laughs)

05:23.824 --> 05:27.294
Beverly Hills, 90210
is how I learned English.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.062
And Kelly?
Oh, she was my favorite.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.332
She was burned in a fire
and she rose from the ashes.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.802
-I know. Take a breath.
Don't be weird. -Okay, yeah.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.737
Oh, hey. I'm glad you're here.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.038
Uh, slight change of plans.
We're now gonna be

05:38.071 --> 05:40.408
-co-hosting the salon.
-False.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.142
I think you'll be whistling
a slightly different tune

05:42.175 --> 05:44.812
when you find out who
I'll be bringing as my plus-one.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.813
Who?

05:45.846 --> 05:46.880
Jennie Garth.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.281
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.252
Kelly Taylor.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.887
No. Neither of them can come.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.323
They're the same person.
Wha-- 90210.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.692
456789. What are you saying?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.260
All right, never mind.
I'm bringing television star

06:00.293 --> 06:02.095
Jennie Garth to the salon.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.064
-No, you're not. -Sabrina,
I would hope you know by now

06:04.097 --> 06:06.534
that if you try and stop me, I'm
just gonna show up and ruin it.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.502
Come on, a few hours ago,
you were saying that my salon

06:08.536 --> 06:10.037
was lame and pretentious.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.238
It is.
Nothing will ever change that.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.440
Oh, so you're social climbing.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.907
You are such a hypocrite.

06:13.941 --> 06:14.942
How is that social climbing?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.076
I invited a performance artist

06:16.109 --> 06:17.778
to an art party.
It makes perfect sense.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.847
Yeah. Television
is the lowest form of art, okay?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.715
It's a rung
below macaroni jewelry.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.751
You're just friends with her
because she's a celebrity.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.218
Well, that's just insane.

06:25.252 --> 06:28.255
She is a-a wonderful,
warm, loving person.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.691
You should take some acting
lessons from your new friend.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.793
Alba, let's go.
We've got work to do.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.595
Uh, I-I can't.
I'm helping Mickey now.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.263
Oh, she promised
to get Jennie to sign

06:36.296 --> 06:38.365
my collector's lunchbox
and thermos. (chuckles)

06:38.398 --> 06:40.534
God. You're worse
than all of us.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.402
Ugh. What a Brenda, right?

06:42.436 --> 06:44.171
(laughing):
Yeah. The worst.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.207
Ah, what do you say
we go for a row?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.810
I'll get the paddles,
you get the canoe down.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.079
Yeah, no problem. I just...

06:52.112 --> 06:54.582
I practically live at the gym,
so I got this.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.650
Good for you.
Hopefully, all that hard work

06:56.684 --> 06:58.886
will show up
on your body one day.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.154
All right, let's see here.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.396
-(Howard screaming)
-Oh! Oh, my God!

07:09.429 --> 07:11.431
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my leg! You crushed me!

07:11.465 --> 07:13.066
What the hell's
the matter with you?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.635
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry, Daddy,
I didn't mean to!

07:14.668 --> 07:16.303
I-I'll call for help!

07:16.336 --> 07:17.638
(grunts)

07:17.671 --> 07:19.172
(shouts)
I got to frickin' cell service!

07:19.206 --> 07:20.608
-We're so screwed.
-Hey, stay with me, kid.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.676
Remember: you're a Buckley.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.678
-It's inside you.
-Where inside me?

07:24.712 --> 07:25.946
Deep inside you.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.180
I'm just having
t-trouble finding it.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.348
-Can you help me...
-Damn it, Chip,

07:28.381 --> 07:30.183
listen to me!

07:30.217 --> 07:32.019
You can do this.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.787
I believe in you.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.988
You're right. I can do this.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.423
I can.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.526
I need you to run back
to the campsite.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.661
I need you to get a tarp,

07:40.694 --> 07:43.030
a lantern
and a bottle of whiskey.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.999
What? What do I look like,
frickin' Tomb Raider?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.434
I can't go into the woods alone.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.269
What-what if I fell
into a crevice,

07:49.302 --> 07:52.172
or I get attacked by wolves
or I get raped by lumberjacks?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.707
Run, damn you!

07:55.843 --> 07:57.444
Duchamp's Fountain
was about the distinction

07:57.477 --> 07:59.446
between art objects
and everyday objects.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.981
It was primarily
a provocation...

08:01.014 --> 08:02.382
Jennie, you came.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.384
-You made it.
-So happy to be here.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.887
Ooh, this house is just pulsing
with artistic energy.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.956
-I can feel it.
-Can you? Yes.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.958
Well, that is the vibe
that I've curated, so...

08:10.991 --> 08:12.159
(chuckles)

08:12.192 --> 08:13.561
Hi, I'm Jennie.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.663
So nice to meet you.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.466
M-Mickey. I invited you.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.301
Oh! I'm sorry.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.736
I just meet so many people.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.072
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm. L-Let me just focus.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.306
Mickey.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.340
-Mm-hmm.
-Right? Mickey, Mickey.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.742
Mickey. Mickley.

08:28.776 --> 08:29.877
Sickly.

08:29.910 --> 08:30.978
Cancer.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.045
Mickey! Ah.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.681
See? I won't forget now.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.650
I hope you don't mind
I brought Totsi.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.819
He just wasn't connecting
with the sitter.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.320
Mm. No, absolutely.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.755
He's a... he's a delight.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.490
We're happy to have
the little ninja.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.593
Ninjas are feudal
Japanese mercenaries.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.027
I'm a karateka.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.495
I fight for honor.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.063
My mistake.
Why don't you go find Ben?

08:50.097 --> 08:51.765
ALBA:
Uh, Mickey?

08:51.799 --> 08:54.401
Uh, you haven't introduced me
to your new friend.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.070
-Jennie, this is Alba.
Alba, Jennie. -Ah.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.205
-Alba.
-Yeah.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.575
Abla. Habla español. Alba!

09:01.609 --> 09:04.578
That was really good.
Oh, so good. Yeah.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.950
Hey.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.585
-Ah, Milky.
-Mm.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.453
-Mickey.
-You know? I wanted to say,

09:13.486 --> 09:15.222
I am just thrilled
that Totsi and Ben

09:15.255 --> 09:16.924
are getting along so great.

09:16.957 --> 09:20.227
Yeah, and a lot of kids
just don't get him, you know?

09:20.260 --> 09:21.862
People don't get
a lot of cool stuff. Right?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.732
Like uni and, uh,
John Cougar Mellencamp.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.933
-Totally. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.534
I mean, it's not our job to put

09:27.567 --> 09:29.737
rules and restrictions
on these kids.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.639
Nope. The only limit
I put on Ben is no limits.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.240
-Mm-hmm! -Right,
I just encourage that guy

09:33.273 --> 09:34.875
-to floor it right through life.
-Mm.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.744
You know, I have been seeing
this new dietician,

09:36.777 --> 09:38.912
and it has changed my life.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.047
Like I can tell,

09:40.080 --> 09:41.281
just by looking at your skin,

09:41.314 --> 09:43.050
that your diet is all wonky.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.654
Let me guess, a lot of potatoes,
beer, empty calories?

09:46.687 --> 09:49.990
I-I mean, I had a potato
for lunch, but...

09:50.023 --> 09:54.027
Is this a safe space
to connect with you physically?

09:55.495 --> 09:57.831
Why do you drink?

09:57.865 --> 10:01.068
Yeah, that's a... cool...

10:01.101 --> 10:03.070
big question.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.237
Are you ashamed?

10:04.271 --> 10:05.839
Lonely? Depressed?

10:05.873 --> 10:07.340
I mean, what is it? Missy,

10:07.374 --> 10:09.609
-your pain is palpable.
-Oh...

10:09.643 --> 10:11.611
-Let it out!
-Okay.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.114
I love feelings. I mean, that's
why we're all artists, right?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.949
So we can just feel things?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.751
-(thudding in distance)
-Sure. Sure. Yeah.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.053
-BEN: No! Stop it!
-I-I'm gonna check on the boys.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.124
Hey, Jennie. Do me, do me!
I like to drink, too.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.325
-(laughs)
-Alba! Yeah.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.061
-Okay. Hi.
-(giggling): Oh!

10:29.797 --> 10:31.799
What the hell happened in here?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.433
Totsi broke my stuff.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.668
I set you free.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.770
Man is enslaved
by his possessions.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.806
Well, that's not really
your call to make, Totsi.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.507
Ben and I like our possessions.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.043
Your spirits are not aligned
with your core values.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.112
No, no, no, no, no.
Come back. Hey!

10:45.145 --> 10:48.215
Open your eyes and... I am not
done talking to you. Hey!

10:48.248 --> 10:49.316
I know you can hear me in there.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.885
He can hear me in there, Ben.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.520
I don't want
to play with him anymore.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.722
You know what?
I don't want to play

10:54.755 --> 10:56.223
with his mom anymore, either.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.825
-(humming)
-What?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.026
What is that? That's a...

10:59.059 --> 11:00.861
That's an irritating sound.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.830
I so envy the work
you guys are doing.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.999
I mean, to be able to create
under stress-free circumstances.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.501
I mean, there's a lot of work
that goes into it, so...

11:08.535 --> 11:10.570
Oh, yes. Of course, of course.
I'm just saying

11:10.603 --> 11:12.405
that you're lucky you're not
an actress, because you don't

11:12.439 --> 11:14.241
have to deal with all
the pressure. You know?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.509
Plus, you're-you're shielded,
you know,

11:16.543 --> 11:18.645
from the-from
the harsh criticisms

11:18.678 --> 11:21.248
of-of... people
actually seeing your work.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.582
Oh, see? Look how lucky you are.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.417
Hey. Excuse me, everyone.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.720
-Hi. Jennie.
-Yeah, Cancer. Right?

11:26.754 --> 11:29.256
-Uh, just real quick.
-Uh...

11:29.289 --> 11:31.224
I-I can't. I can't do it
anymore, she-she sucks.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.260
Look, I don't care
if she's a celebrity,

11:33.293 --> 11:35.262
she's the worst, her son's
the worst. They got to go.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.064
But she is still Jennie.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.698
-Who cares? She's...
-Enough is enough.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.533
Okay? I gave her a chance.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.403
She sucks. She's got to go.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.105
Okay.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.440
I respect you, and if
it's that important to you,

11:47.474 --> 11:49.609
-I will ask her to leave.
-Thank you.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.579
But I'm gonna need
that bracelet first.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.581
-Oh, no. Don't...
-Fine.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.916
Whatever.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.084
-Oh...
-Boot her.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.753
Oh, don't do it.
(scoffs)

12:01.621 --> 12:03.390
-Jen, hey.
-Mm!

12:03.423 --> 12:04.792
-Can we talk for just a second?
-Oh.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.860
I am having so much fun.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.062
-We have to do this more often.
-Yeah, well, that's the thing.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.597
-Eh, this isn't gonna be the...
-Saturday.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.899
I'm going to a thing.
You should come.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.902
Yeah. Oh, Mario
is gonna love you.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.236
-Mario?
-Lopez.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.637
-(gasps) Uh...
-Yeah.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.140
-His parties are insane.
-Uh-huh? Are they?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.209
So, yeah,
I'll forward you the thing.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.444
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Forward it on over.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.612
Okay.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.115
Ooh, yay! I love our friendship.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.649
-Oh, gosh! Our-our friendship...
-(clattering in distance)

12:29.682 --> 12:32.119
...is-is great.
I'm gonna go check on the boys.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.521
-BEN: Ow! That hurt!
-I'm gonna check on those guys.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.831
(gasping)

12:43.864 --> 12:44.832
Hey! Let go of him.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.466
Not until he submits.

12:46.499 --> 12:50.437
-You will release him right now,
you little jerk! -Ow!

12:50.470 --> 12:53.106
I... I'm sorry.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.741
I'm telling Jennie!

12:54.774 --> 12:56.509
No. I'm sorry.
I was-I was kidding.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.911
That was a great chokehold.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.512
-Move! I'm telling!
-No, no, no...

12:59.546 --> 13:00.780
Ah, ah, ah!

13:03.116 --> 13:05.685
I'm afraid I can't let you
do that, Totsi.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.324
Okay, uh, this is not ideal,
I see that.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.293
But we-we can fix this, right?
What would you like?

13:13.326 --> 13:15.595
Would you like some ice cream?
I can bring some brownies up...

13:15.628 --> 13:17.530
-I want Jennie!
-Shh! Okay.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.833
I can't do that,
but anything else.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.535
-Jennie! -Shut it! We got to
shut this kid up. All right.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.037
-Listen... whoa!
-(shouts)

13:24.071 --> 13:25.205
What are you doing?

13:25.238 --> 13:26.506
You wanted me to shut him up.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.841
We don't hit.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.676
Here. Stuff this sock
in his mouth.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.044
ALBA:
Y-You don't have to get...

13:31.078 --> 13:32.312
What?
(gasps)

13:32.345 --> 13:33.713
What have you done?

13:33.746 --> 13:35.548
I know. I'm trying to fix it.
Okay?

13:35.582 --> 13:36.950
-But what about my thermos?
-We're way past that now.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.486
-I need your help.
-No! No, no, no, no, no.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.388
I only did all of this
to be friends with Jennie,

13:41.421 --> 13:43.857
-and that is all I care about.
-We don't need Jennie anymore.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.725
-What? -She invited me
to Mario Lopez's birthday party

13:45.758 --> 13:47.027
this weekend.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.795
And do you know
what he has access to?

13:48.828 --> 13:49.863
All of Hollywood.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.131
-All of Hollywood.
-Okay, yeah.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.799
Yeah. We leapfrog this bitch.

13:52.832 --> 13:53.967
Let's go secure that invite.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.168
-Ben, hang out with Totsi.
-Yeah.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.236
But I don't want to.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.871
He broke all the stuff I like.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.072
Then break something he likes.
I don't know.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.307
-Figure it out.
-Yeah.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.009
(door closes)

14:02.042 --> 14:03.810
(panting):
I got it, I got all the stuff!

14:03.843 --> 14:05.078
I got all the stuff! I did...

14:05.112 --> 14:07.180
I was so fast, Dad!
I was so fast!

14:07.214 --> 14:08.815
Okay. First thing
we got to do...

14:08.848 --> 14:10.217
(grunts)

14:10.250 --> 14:13.086
...we got to sterilize
the wound.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.524
-Seriously?!
-I'm so, so sorry.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.260
-Give me the booze.
-(panting): Okay.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.035
-(yelling in pain)
-(groans)

14:28.068 --> 14:29.336
Ow!

14:29.369 --> 14:31.438
All right...
(grunts in pain)

14:31.471 --> 14:33.506
All right, you're
gonna pop the bone back in

14:33.540 --> 14:34.841
while I bite down on this.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.043
Are you insane?
I can't do that!

14:36.076 --> 14:38.511
Of course you can do it.
You're a Buckley!

14:38.545 --> 14:41.748
-(quietly): I'm a Buckley.
-Okay, grab my leg.

14:41.781 --> 14:45.252
On three, I want you to pull
with all your strength.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.319
Okay.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.256
One,

14:49.289 --> 14:50.757
two, three!

14:50.790 --> 14:53.060
-(cracks)
-(screaming)

14:53.093 --> 14:55.862
(sobbing): I asked you
to pull, you bastard!

14:55.895 --> 14:58.465
-I thought you said push!
-I clearly said pull.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.401
It's okay.
We're gonna do it again.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.770
And this time pull,
you son of a bitch!

15:05.973 --> 15:07.740
One, two...

15:07.774 --> 15:09.242
three!

15:09.276 --> 15:11.411
-(crack)
-Oh-ho-ho!

15:11.444 --> 15:13.580
Aha! I did it!

15:13.613 --> 15:15.148
I'm like
a frickin' ortho surgeon!

15:15.182 --> 15:17.717
-Boom, baby!
-That was the easy part.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.987
Now you have
to drag me out of here.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.921
Really? I... you know, I...

15:21.955 --> 15:24.891
I feel like we should...
we should just rest, or...

15:24.924 --> 15:27.627
-you know, just start fresh
in the morning. -Damn it, Chip,

15:27.660 --> 15:29.296
I'll be dead by morning.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.663
You need to unfold this tarp

15:30.697 --> 15:33.600
and put me on it
and drag me out of here,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.235
following the North Star.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.005
What's the North Star?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.806
(sighs)

15:39.839 --> 15:40.974
(clinking)

15:41.008 --> 15:42.742
Hi. Uh...

15:42.775 --> 15:45.912
I'm sorry, I just want to say
a couple of things.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.517
Tonight has been one of the most
inspiring nights of my life.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.320
I... I've been
kind of down lately.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.023
Well, since 9/11, actually.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.091
But not tonight.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.193
Tonight I am feeling reborn.

16:00.227 --> 16:03.496
And it is because
of all of you, really.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.498
You know what?
I have idea.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.534
I think we should make a pact,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.802
right here, right now,

16:09.836 --> 16:12.605
to never stop creating.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.274
(murmuring)

16:14.307 --> 16:16.676
'Cause I can't do it alone,
not anymore.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.811
I need you guys. Okay?

16:18.845 --> 16:20.847
Thank you. Really.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.981
Cheers.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.383
(sparse clapping)

16:23.416 --> 16:25.552
I am so sorry about her.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.287
Why? She's great.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.489
She's so passionate.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.459
-I was the biggest fan
of her show. -I'm happy

16:32.492 --> 16:34.461
-to introduce you. -Would you?
That would be amazing.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.462
Of course.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.397
Hey, you havin'
a good time, buddy?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.666
-Hi! -Listen, uh, do you think I
could grab that invite from you

16:39.699 --> 16:41.534
real quick, just so I
could pop it in my calendar?

16:41.568 --> 16:42.969
I don't want the day to fill up.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.671
-Oh, sure.
-Jen. So sorry to interrupt.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.739
Um, I hooked a fan.
Not shocking, I know.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.741
Okay, but not now, not now.
Hey, where is your phone?

16:48.775 --> 16:51.411
You want me to call it to see
if we can hear it buzz or...?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.213
Um, Totsi confiscated it--
he thinks

16:53.246 --> 16:55.082
I'm too reliant
on the technology.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.916
Oh, man, you two have
a beautiful relationship.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.319
-I'll go grab it.
-You know, I'll go.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.021
-It's time for his hug anyway.
-No! Nobody touches the boys.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.891
-Is everything okay?
-Of course everything's okay.

17:04.924 --> 17:05.992
What are you...

17:06.025 --> 17:07.560
-Wha...?
-She is... she loves a party.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.762
She can't stand to miss
a minute of a party.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.898
You two hang out. Have fun.
I'll be right back.

17:11.931 --> 17:15.335
-Mm. Enjoy ourselves.
-Yeah. We're cool.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.938
-Mush. Mush.
-(quiet grunting)

17:18.971 --> 17:20.407
Mush!

17:20.440 --> 17:21.874
Leave me here to die.

17:21.908 --> 17:24.611
-I'm just a pile of meat now.
-(coyotes howling)

17:24.644 --> 17:26.879
Stop talking like that.
You're gonna make it.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.449
Strip my clothes off...

17:29.482 --> 17:32.051
so the coyotes
can pick up my scent.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.554
Shut up.
I think I hear something.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.089
It's probably the dogs.

17:36.123 --> 17:39.259
Go. You can get a head start
while they feast.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.661
It's a car!
There must be a road!

17:44.631 --> 17:46.266
(panting)

17:48.835 --> 17:50.637
(gasping breaths)

18:02.415 --> 18:04.151
Whoa, are you okay?

18:04.184 --> 18:06.219
(panting):
No.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.321
My dad needs a hospital.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.056
Okay, just calm down.
What's your name?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.392
Chip.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.262
Chip Buckley.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.998
All right, Totsi, I need
your mom's pho... (gasps)

18:19.031 --> 18:20.433
Ben? What did you do?!

18:20.467 --> 18:22.635
I took his hair,
just like you said.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.171
I didn't say that.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.173
I didn't say anything
remotely close to that.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.475
Oh, this is bad.
No, no, no, no, no.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.909
This is very bad.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.311
Aw, Ben.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.513
Okay, do-do you have,
like, a hot glue gun

18:33.546 --> 18:35.448
-or something?
-ALBA: No. Wait. You cannot...

18:35.482 --> 18:37.484
Mickey, what the hell?

18:37.517 --> 18:39.319
Damn it, Alba, I told you
to keep her out of here.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.088
Well, she promised me tickets
to the Met Gala.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.924
-Do you even know what that is?
-It sounds very exclusive.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.460
-What did you do?
-I didn't do this. Ben did.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.661
Mickey tied him up.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.096
-Wha...
-I did do that.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.931
-Okay, we need to fix it.
-I thought you hated her.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.601
I did, but now she's my ticket
to the junior museum board.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.169
Oh, could you stop obsessing
about boards?

18:56.203 --> 18:58.505
Nobody cares about boards!
I need her to help me

18:58.538 --> 19:00.540
get into Mario Lopez's
birthday party.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.376
-Aha! You are social climbing.
-Of course I'm social climbing.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.278
I want to be friends
with celebrities. Who doesn't?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.380
Okay, we got to figure out
something, because I am going

19:07.414 --> 19:09.349
to that gala, or I am getting
my thermos signed.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.118
Well, okay, um, let's think.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.853
All right, how about
we just feed her drinks

19:13.886 --> 19:16.022
until she blacks out,
and then when she comes to,

19:16.055 --> 19:18.024
we tell her that she
shaved her son's head.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.125
That's the stupidest idea
you've ever had.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.660
-It wasn't a great one.
-Oh, yeah,

19:20.693 --> 19:22.662
but maybe we shave
our heads, too,

19:22.695 --> 19:25.365
make her think she went
on a head-shaving rampage.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.234
-I'm not shaving my head!
-Mm, not gonna do that, no.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.368
Well, I was piggybacking
on yours.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.569
Oh, my God!

19:29.602 --> 19:30.703
Totsi?

19:30.737 --> 19:32.339
-(muffled shouts)
-Hey, girl.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.844
They, you know, the boys,
they were just playing

19:37.877 --> 19:40.146
-cowboys and Indians.
-No. My Totsi

19:40.179 --> 19:41.848
does not reenact genocide.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.483
He marches against it.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.184
-He's a really woke kid.
-Yeah, you know,

19:45.218 --> 19:47.554
I think we're all gonna
laugh our butts off about this,

19:47.587 --> 19:50.022
-you know, at Mario's party.
-(forced laughter)

19:50.056 --> 19:51.758
No, no. I never want
to see you again.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.159
I thought you were
my friend, Mindred.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.827
It's Mickey! I...

19:54.861 --> 19:56.396
Are you okay, baby?
Let's get out of here.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.764
(screams)

19:57.797 --> 19:59.198
Ben did it.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.067
-Yeah, it was him.
-(gasps)

20:01.100 --> 20:02.602
Hey.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.037
I'm so proud of you.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.774
You were a real Buckley today.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.377
But I have some bad news.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.880
I'm bleeding internally.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.047
What?

20:15.081 --> 20:16.749
(crying):
Daddy, no.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.452
(chuckles)
I'm just messin' with ya.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.988
(both laughing)

20:24.824 --> 20:26.859
Mm.
(chuckles)

20:26.893 --> 20:29.095
-MAN: Excuse me.
-Phillip. Come on in.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.333
(whispers)

20:34.634 --> 20:36.102
(door closes)

20:36.135 --> 20:37.904
Chip, inside this envelope

20:37.937 --> 20:42.108
are the results of a DNA test
I requested this morning.

20:42.141 --> 20:45.144
I wanted to find out just how
much you and I had in common.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.080
Turns out nothing.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.582
Huh?

20:49.616 --> 20:52.385
I'm not your dad.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.487
Ha-ha! The joke of all jokes.

20:54.521 --> 20:55.888
You got me.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.590
It's not a joke.
This is real life, son.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.659
Oh, sorry. Chip.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.929
Um, I asked an FBI buddy of mine

21:02.962 --> 21:04.597
to run a DNA match for you,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.499
and your dad was already
in the system,

21:06.533 --> 21:08.267
so it was a pretty quick search.

21:13.205 --> 21:16.208
I just hope he's a better man
than that file indicates.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.650
ALBA:
It kind of looks like balls.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.652
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:28.287 --> 21:30.256
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.525
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.127
MAN (on PA): United--

21:35.161 --> 21:36.996
Good afternoon, everyone.
This is your captain.

21:37.029 --> 21:41.033
Flight 1610,
service to "Lost Wages."

21:42.201 --> 21:43.836
Why aren't you laughing?

21:43.870 --> 21:45.472
I've heard it,
like, 1,200 times.

21:48.074 --> 21:53.012
LA to Vegas is set
on a budget passenger airline

21:53.045 --> 21:55.482
that goes from LA to Vegas
every weekend

21:55.515 --> 21:58.284
and then back from Vegas to LA
at the end of the weekend.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.053
It's just a bunch of regulars
who fly on this route.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.556
It's a little like
a Cheers in the sky.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.725
We all say
it's Love Boat
in the sky.

22:05.758 --> 22:09.529
Jackpot Airlines is probably
the finest airline
you could ever fly

22:09.562 --> 22:12.732
because not only
do you get there,
you get free peanuts.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.968
I thought I was going
to travel the world,

22:16.002 --> 22:17.370
meet interesting people.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.971
I thought I would
have adventures.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.007
I thought I was gonna
be a dancer.
Oh, my God.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.875
Is that how crazy
I sound?

22:22.909 --> 22:24.911
Ronnie's such a mess
in her personal life.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.146
When she's on the plane, she
knows exactly what she's doing.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.215
She can keep every single person
in check.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.584
If I can't have some fun
with my passengers,
why am I here?

22:31.618 --> 22:34.521
To fly the plane.
Go do that.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.056
MAN: Bernard. He's a senior
flight attendant.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.526
He knows everything. He knows
everything about everyone.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.494
Got dressed
in the terminal again,
didn't you?

22:41.528 --> 22:42.929
At least I wore
underwear this time.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.599
My character, Artem,
he's a professional
gambler.

22:46.633 --> 22:50.036
How'd you do
this weekend?
So-so.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.705
What about you?
Pretty good.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.007
Nichole goes to Vegas
on the weekends and strips.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.209
So I'm an exotic dancer,
and I get naked at work.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.945
But I also get naked
in my home.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.748
-Can I write that off
as a home office?
-I don't believe so.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.249
My character is Colin.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.184
I'm a professor
of economics.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.520
He goes to Vegas every weekend
to see his son,

23:07.554 --> 23:09.856
to try and reassemble
their family unit.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.425
But then, of course,
the wrinkle is
that he meets Ronnie.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.930
MATULA: It's just full
of real weird characters

23:17.964 --> 23:21.267
living their lives
every day on a plane
going from LA to Vegas.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.370
Every moment
is going to be filled
with something exciting.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.773
(shouts)

23:26.806 --> 23:29.141
Consider yourself grounded.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.814
I don't like to
be up in the air too long

23:34.847 --> 23:36.483
because I get dementia.
