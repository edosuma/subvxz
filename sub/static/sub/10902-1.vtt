They'll kill us,
I know it. I don't
want to die.

04:56.993 --> 05:01.089
Don't show them
you're scared.

05:01.163 --> 05:03.324

08:00.901 --> 08:02.765
<i>Hm?</i>

08:30.295 --> 08:32.525
Do you want
to end up
like Nina?

08:34.265 --> 08:39.760
They buried her
in Rishon Beach, three
meters under the ground.

08:39.837 --> 08:42.533
They plan to do
the same to you.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.035
Are you not
listening to me?

08:49.279 --> 08:52.146
Wash your damned face,
change your clothes,

08:52.216 --> 08:55.674
and go back
to the nest.
There's no time.

08:59.356 --> 09:02.347
Everything hurts.

09:02.425 --> 09:06.327
Galia, you're not
listening to me.

09:10.266 --> 09:12.427
I'm not going
back there.

09:19.007 --> 09:21.032
They'll burn
your body,

09:21.109 --> 09:24.704
and sweep the ashes away
till nothing's left.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.051
Let me go.

09:30.118 --> 09:33.747
<i>Listen, bitch.</i>

09:33.822 --> 09:38.258
Who the hell are
you to tell me what
you want or don't want?

09:38.325 --> 09:42.159
Who the hell are you?
You dirty whore!

09:42.229 --> 09:45.528
You abandoned
your child! You make
a living thanks to me!

09:45.599 --> 09:49.035
You bitch!
You're still alive
because I say so!

09:56.577 --> 09:58.703
You want
to leave?

10:01.514 --> 10:04.847
Want me
to help you?

10:06.552 --> 10:09.885
So help me, too.
Nothing in life
is free.

10:16.528 --> 10:19.520
<i>Give it to me.</i>

10:23.035 --> 10:25.868
Here, it's yours
from now on.

10:25.938 --> 10:30.398
Now you get out
of the car,
go there,

10:30.475 --> 10:34.070
put a bullet in
the guard's head,

10:34.146 --> 10:38.138
and two in that fat
guy. Is that clear?

10:38.215 --> 10:42.743
You want to leave
the nest, right? This
is the quick way out.

10:48.292 --> 10:50.021
You want me
to call the guys

10:50.094 --> 10:55.360
and tell them to go
to Dobrinensky 37,
apartment 6?

10:55.432 --> 10:56.865
Is it apartment 6?

10:56.933 --> 10:58.366
<i>Third floor,
apartment 6.</i>

10:58.435 --> 11:01.632
Is that what you want?
It's not a problem.

11:01.705 --> 11:05.368
Look what
they sent me.

11:05.442 --> 11:09.674
Look what they
sent me... just now.

<i>All this technology,
it's unbelievable.</i>

<i>Someone on the other
side of the world
takes a picture,</i>

11:19.088 --> 11:22.888

in a second.
Fantastic.

11:24.426 --> 11:27.691
Calm down.
Calm down!

11:29.965 --> 11:31.796
Save your strength.

11:31.867 --> 11:34.357
Relax. They
won't kill her.

11:34.435 --> 11:39.873
Are you crazy?
We're not animals.

11:39.941 --> 11:42.432
It's a shame.

11:42.510 --> 11:45.206
She's so beautiful.

11:45.279 --> 11:47.372
They'll turn her into
what you've become.

11:47.448 --> 11:50.940
What a shame.
She'll go down
the same road as you.

11:51.019 --> 11:54.249
She'll pay for
what you've done,
if you don't do this.

11:54.321 --> 11:56.221
Is that what
you want?

12:00.594 --> 12:02.186
Is it?

12:09.002 --> 12:10.332
Is it?

12:18.644 --> 12:21.977
I want my passport.
And my money.

12:22.048 --> 12:26.485
Oh, thank God.

12:26.552 --> 12:29.987
That's what
I wanted to hear.
You're a smart girl.

12:30.055 --> 12:33.582
That's why I like you.
You grasp things
so quickly!

12:33.658 --> 12:35.285
Passport and money!

12:35.360 --> 12:37.294
Shut up!
I'm not deaf!

12:37.362 --> 12:39.796
You'll get it. Do
what I asked you to.

12:39.864 --> 12:42.025
Go ahead,

<i>[People shouting]</i>

17:29.839 --> 17:33.707

find yourself
some decent clothes.

17:33.776 --> 17:36.676
And fix this place up.

17:36.745 --> 17:38.804
We'll talk later.

17:38.880 --> 17:43.579
Is this all? Where's
the rest of the money
and my passport?

17:55.463 --> 17:57.693
I'll be here at 8: 00.

How are you?

19:04.629 --> 19:07.496
<i>What do you want?</i>

19:07.565 --> 19:11.432
To talk.
Let me talk
to her, please.

19:15.772 --> 19:18.240
I'm coming home.

19:18.308 --> 19:20.299
<i>What for?</i>

19:20.377 --> 19:22.845
I want to see her.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.548
<i>Don't come back.</i>

19:26.616 --> 19:29.880
<i>I told her
you are dead.</i>

19:31.787 --> 19:35.052
<i>Daddy, what are we
having for lunch?</i>

19:35.124 --> 19:38.685
<i>Lena, be quiet.
I'm on the phone.</i>

19:39.829 --> 19:43.822
Please. Let me
speak with her.

22:57.149 --> 22:58.878
This is my last job.

23:00.318 --> 23:03.515
And if I
say it's not?

23:03.588 --> 23:05.886
But you promised.

23:05.957 --> 23:11.088
<i>I thought we'd
celebrate properly,
with H umus and Vodka.</i>

23:11.162 --> 23:13.722
But you have
no patience.

23:14.932 --> 23:17.765
Take it.

23:17.835 --> 23:20.462
In two weeks.

23:20.537 --> 23:24.132
It's not first class,
but it's a window seat.

23:25.342 --> 23:27.105
Where's the rest
of the money?

23:27.177 --> 23:31.409
Do your job now. Come back
in two days to get your
money and passport.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.825
Turn off music now
or I call police.

bottle of water.

Also tissue.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.727
What?

27:32.242 --> 27:37.043
I don't have tissue,
but I have toilet
paper, extra soft.

27:38.315 --> 27:40.875
It's closest I found.

27:45.255 --> 27:47.245

27:59.335 --> 28:00.825
It's good,
these noodles.

28:02.338 --> 28:04.965
I like this, too.

28:05.040 --> 28:10.000
Just that you have
to know how to, um,

28:10.078 --> 28:15.038
toss it, how to
jump it, you know.

28:15.116 --> 28:17.016
And make
the sauce good.

be back soon.

he gets angry, you know.
If he knows I'm here...

28:39.440 --> 28:40.771
So go.

28:53.786 --> 28:55.583
This you paint?

29:00.660 --> 29:03.457
Looks like Eilat.

29:03.528 --> 29:05.155
Eilat?

29:05.230 --> 29:06.959
Yes.

29:07.032 --> 29:09.592
It's a city
in the South.

29:09.668 --> 29:11.295

sometimes he has
a bad day at work,

29:41.364 --> 29:45.892
sometimes too much money
to pay for bills, sometimes
weather no good.

Yes, I know.

<i>Much better

that look and you say,

36:40.128 --> 36:42.118
That's what
Roni wants.

36:43.364 --> 36:46.094

Why are you acting
like a baby?

43:17.704 --> 43:20.867
I told you a
thousand times, Roni

43:20.941 --> 43:24.808
They're not like
me. They have a
different mindset.

43:24.877 --> 43:27.812
Why can't you
understand that?
They don't trust you.

43:27.880 --> 43:32.579

trustworthy. That's all.

there anything, but,

just that I can
feel a connection,

it's in the Mikveh.

Where?

47:50.762 --> 47:52.787
The Mikveh.

01:00:57.407 --> 01:00:59.398
Girl.

01:00:59.476 --> 01:01:00.500
<i>Really?</i>

01:01:00.577 --> 01:01:03.603
Yes, really.
Why not?

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.444
Nothing. It's
just I didn't know.

01:01:09.719 --> 01:01:12.687
<i>Your daughter,
she's in Russia?</i>

01:01:12.755 --> 01:01:14.655
Ukraine.

01:01:14.723 --> 01:01:19.558
<i>And you came here
to work, to make
money for her?</i>

01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:30.564
<i>You're a good mother.</i>

01:01:32.674 --> 01:01:34.608
I would do
the same, you know.

01:01:34.676 --> 01:01:36.075
Don't touch it,
leave it alone.

01:01:36.144 --> 01:01:37.441
Why you have this?

01:01:37.512 --> 01:01:39.173
It's not your problem.

01:01:39.247 --> 01:01:41.238
Don't bullshit me,
tell me the truth.

01:01:41.316 --> 01:01:43.375
Put it back.

01:01:46.554 --> 01:01:50.387
Teach me how to
use it. I'm serious.

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:54.325
This is not for pregnant
women! Give it to me,
it's dangerous.

01:01:54.394 --> 01:01:57.295
This thing is heavy.
[Shoots]

01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:14.771
You didn't answer me.

01:02:14.847 --> 01:02:17.407
Why do you have this?

01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:20.646
With this rain and
thunder, nobody
heard anything.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.553
You owe me a
TV. 21 -inch plus
remote control.

01:02:23.623 --> 01:02:25.352
You owe me
an answer, Galia.

01:02:28.426 --> 01:02:31.418
Don't ask questions that
answers you don't
want to know.

01:02:41.072 --> 01:02:43.438
If you don't want
to tell me, fine.

01:02:43.508 --> 01:02:46.999
At least teach me.
I want to know
how to use it.

01:02:47.077 --> 01:02:48.635
It's not for
woman with baby.

01:02:48.712 --> 01:02:50.771
He's going to
come back soon,

01:02:50.848 --> 01:02:54.875
and if you teach me
to be strong like you,
maybe he will stop.

01:02:54.952 --> 01:02:57.420
It's a waste of time.
It does not help.

01:02:57.488 --> 01:03:02.653
Wait, Galia. Teach me.
I want to know.

01:03:02.726 --> 01:03:06.821
A woman with baby
needs to know how
to protect herself.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.805
Two, three, four.

01:03:22.879 --> 01:03:26.245
<i>[Clap of thunder]</i>

01:03:26.315 --> 01:03:30.274
Okay, to hit
target is not most
important thing.

01:03:30.352 --> 01:03:33.788
First you need
to learn not
to be afraid.

01:03:33.855 --> 01:03:36.380
Hold gun strong.

01:03:36.458 --> 01:03:38.187
Strong!

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.091
Okay.

01:03:48.602 --> 01:03:51.127
Two, three, four.

01:03:51.205 --> 01:03:54.538
<i>[Clap of thunder]</i>

01:03:54.608 --> 01:03:58.567
No fear, no fear.
Point straight, okay?

01:03:58.646 --> 01:04:00.773
<i>Strong, hold the
gun strong. Hazak!</i>

01:04:00.848 --> 01:04:02.212
But I'm holding strong.

01:04:02.282 --> 01:04:05.080
No, you hold gun
like little girl.

01:04:05.151 --> 01:04:08.018
Hold gun like woman.

01:04:08.088 --> 01:04:10.648
Don't let gun hold
you. You hold gun.

01:04:16.496 --> 01:04:19.863
Two, three, four.

01:04:19.933 --> 01:04:22.696
<i>[Clap of thunder]</i>

01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:33.937
Now, teach me
how to aim.

01:05:02.372 --> 01:05:04.806
<i>Who are you
talking to?</i>

01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:07.309
Tzipora.

01:05:07.377 --> 01:05:10.175
<i>Send my regards
to your sister.</i>

01:05:10.247 --> 01:05:12.613
<i>He sends
regards, sis.</i>

01:05:12.682 --> 01:05:14.912
<i>Where's my drink?</i>

01:05:14.985 --> 01:05:16.282
In a sec.

01:05:16.353 --> 01:05:19.685
<i>You said that
an hour ago.</i>

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.584
<i>Are you ready?</i>

01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:28.095
Yes.

01:05:28.164 --> 01:05:30.291
Did you count
like I told you?

01:05:30.366 --> 01:05:32.493
My last period
was one week ago.

01:05:32.568 --> 01:05:36.664
Yes, because they're
like... The women over
there are so fussy.

01:05:44.145 --> 01:05:46.613
Bring me some of
the ice cream you bought.

01:05:48.249 --> 01:05:49.841
Okay.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.311
Can we go already?

01:05:54.389 --> 01:05:56.515
<i>Soon.</i>

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:59.058
<i>Are you bringing it?</i>

01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:01.993
The gorilla just
woke up. I have to go.

01:06:11.371 --> 01:06:13.965
May you bring
your mother much
joy, you hear?

01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:15.837
And many grandchildren.

01:06:15.908 --> 01:06:17.068
Thank you.

01:06:17.143 --> 01:06:18.667
Goodbye.

01:06:20.746 --> 01:06:24.842
God bless you,
pious woman. Good
that you came here.

01:06:24.917 --> 01:06:26.145
How are you?

01:06:26.219 --> 01:06:29.711
Thank God.
I just...

01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:32.155
My head hit the wall.

01:06:32.225 --> 01:06:34.784
Show me.

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.987
I don't think I can
go in like this.

01:06:37.062 --> 01:06:39.121
It's not so bad.

01:06:41.967 --> 01:06:45.300
I'm accompanying
a friend.

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:48.271
Are you married?

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:51.503
She's engaged.

01:06:51.576 --> 01:06:56.603
I didn't see a ring,
but okay. A bride to
be. Congratulations.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.477
When is the wedding?

01:06:59.817 --> 01:07:01.944
In two days.

01:07:02.019 --> 01:07:03.919
Did you count
seven clean days?

01:07:03.988 --> 01:07:06.081
Yes, we counted.

01:07:06.157 --> 01:07:07.954
What's your
name, bride?

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:16.062
Galia.
Galia Rasimova.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.774
Mazal!

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:29.311
Bring out a cake,
we have another bride.

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:36.276
Maybe it is
not a good idea.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.145
Give me your
hand. Sure it is.

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:45.255
It's not for me,
this thing.

01:07:46.628 --> 01:07:49.654
Don't worry,
it's nothing.

01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:52.995
Just like going naked
into a swimming pool.

01:07:53.067 --> 01:07:55.297
Didn't you
ever do this?

01:07:58.406 --> 01:08:01.034
Not when God
was looking at me.

01:08:06.781 --> 01:08:08.681
I'm not going in.

01:08:08.749 --> 01:08:11.478
Are you crazy?
They're waiting for you.

01:08:11.551 --> 01:08:14.520
Everybody has
to be clean.

01:08:14.588 --> 01:08:18.991
That's for
good people.

01:08:20.594 --> 01:08:22.926
But you are
good people.

01:08:27.267 --> 01:08:32.294
He will see me, and he
will know immediately
how dirty I am.

01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:36.104
<i>Stop talking
bullshit, Galia.</i>

01:08:42.314 --> 01:08:45.578
I did many things
that are not good.

01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:48.176
In Ukraine.

01:08:48.252 --> 01:08:50.015
Also here.

01:08:55.193 --> 01:08:58.185
But worst
thing I do, l...

01:08:58.263 --> 01:09:02.096
I left me daughter
and my husband.

01:09:04.636 --> 01:09:07.196
My daughter,
when she was
one year old,

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:13.535
I just got
up and left.

01:09:15.845 --> 01:09:17.711
<i>What's her name?</i>

01:09:20.517 --> 01:09:22.006
Yelena.

01:09:23.654 --> 01:09:25.451
She's five now.

01:09:30.893 --> 01:09:33.327
Why did you leave her?

01:09:36.866 --> 01:09:38.527
She...

01:09:42.638 --> 01:09:44.731
She didn't
come out right.

01:09:49.778 --> 01:09:52.542
Hey.

01:09:52.613 --> 01:09:56.948
These things
happen, Galia.
It's not your fault.

01:09:58.186 --> 01:10:00.279
It just happens.

01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:12.564
The doctor said
she has not enough
oxygen in her brain.

01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:15.830
She will not be
normal like everyone.

01:10:18.972 --> 01:10:21.236
It's all
because of me.

01:10:21.308 --> 01:10:22.969
No, it's not.

01:10:23.043 --> 01:10:24.441
It's my fault.

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.068
No, it's not.

01:10:26.145 --> 01:10:28.272
I know, I feel it.

01:10:29.482 --> 01:10:31.211
Hey.

01:10:31.284 --> 01:10:33.184
And I left her.

01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:38.282
I'm a monster.

01:10:40.593 --> 01:10:43.720
Galia. Hey.

01:10:45.263 --> 01:10:48.027
I can feel you
love your daughter.

01:10:50.869 --> 01:10:53.531
I can feel you
love her very much.

01:11:06.317 --> 01:11:08.410
Call them.

01:11:13.124 --> 01:11:14.921
I'm ready.

01:11:39.349 --> 01:11:43.216
Galia, darling,
put your arms
beside your body.

01:11:43.285 --> 01:11:46.049
Spread your
legs a bit.

01:11:46.121 --> 01:11:48.783
Stretch your
fingers out.

01:12:18.952 --> 01:12:23.753
Darling, spread
your arms apart, touch
no part of your body,

01:12:23.824 --> 01:12:27.988
immerse yourself
three times, and
you come out purified.

01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:33.759
Kosher.

01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:38.932
Kosher.

01:12:41.674 --> 01:12:44.404
Kosher.

01:13:31.388 --> 01:13:33.754
<i>"Blessed are You,
O Lord, King of
the universe,</i>

01:13:33.824 --> 01:13:36.053
<i>who has sanctified us
with His commandments</i>

01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:38.355
<i>and commanded us
regarding the immersion. "</i>

01:13:57.812 --> 01:13:59.677
Galia?

01:13:59.748 --> 01:14:02.148
How's it going?

01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:06.983
Go home.

01:14:07.055 --> 01:14:08.852
Who is that?

01:14:08.924 --> 01:14:10.892
People from work.
Go home.

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:17.522
Go, I said.

01:14:27.975 --> 01:14:32.377
Mishka asked to give you
your passport and money.

01:14:32.445 --> 01:14:34.743
Come here and take it.

01:14:36.449 --> 01:14:38.383
Get out and show me.

01:15:46.616 --> 01:15:48.106
You didn't come home.

01:15:48.183 --> 01:15:52.210
You said there's
bus every hour.
Let's go.

01:15:52.287 --> 01:15:55.085
What, like this?
In the middle of the day?

01:15:55.157 --> 01:15:57.785
Come on. Come.

01:16:03.232 --> 01:16:05.530
If I go,
I can't come back.

01:16:05.601 --> 01:16:07.568
Can't come
back after a week,

01:16:07.635 --> 01:16:09.728
crawling like an idiot,
because then he...

01:16:09.804 --> 01:16:11.101
I will take
care of you.

01:16:11.172 --> 01:16:12.867
How?

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.771
With your gun?

01:16:20.148 --> 01:16:22.480
I told him.

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:27.248
Told him about the baby,
and he promised that
he will change.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:30.619
A baby needs
a father.

01:16:30.691 --> 01:16:32.386
<i>I want to give
him another chance.</i>

01:16:32.459 --> 01:16:34.689
To do what?

01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:36.388
He promised.

01:16:36.463 --> 01:16:39.728
To do what? H uh?

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.463
Look at this.
Your face, your wounds.

01:16:43.537 --> 01:16:46.437
This you can fix.
A baby you can't.

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.842
He promised.

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:58.816
They always promise.

01:17:26.376 --> 01:17:30.312
It's hot there,
very hot.

01:17:32.049 --> 01:17:34.745
I think all
this hot weather

01:17:34.818 --> 01:17:37.616
and all the sun
is not good for
the baby, you know?

01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:43.081
I also don't know
the hospital there.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:45.286
I don't know if
it's any good or not.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:47.591
Forget about
him, okay?

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.563
Away from him
you're safe.

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:54.626
He'll find me.

01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:57.104
I can feel it.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:18:00.540
He'll find me
and he'll finish
me, I know it.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.079
I can't do this.

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:17.250
It won't stop.
He'll never change.
You're making a mistake.

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:20.852
You must confront this,
you must not be afraid.
You have to run away.

01:18:20.928 --> 01:18:23.192
No. I don't want to.

01:18:23.264 --> 01:18:25.323
You want to run?
You can go. I stay.

01:18:25.399 --> 01:18:27.924
You go back now, you put
you and your baby in danger.

01:18:28.002 --> 01:18:29.469
I know what
I'm doing, Galia.

01:18:29.537 --> 01:18:31.027
You come with me.

01:18:31.105 --> 01:18:34.131
No, let go of me!
You're not my mother.
I'm going home.

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:35.971
You come with me.
I help you!

01:18:36.043 --> 01:18:38.136
You're not helping me,
you're hurting me!

01:18:38.212 --> 01:18:39.839
I do what is
good for you!

01:18:39.914 --> 01:18:42.609
<i>Who do you think
you are? All you
do is run away.</i>

01:18:42.682 --> 01:18:46.948
You run away from
your country, from your
family, from your child.

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.454
I don't need
to run away, okay?
