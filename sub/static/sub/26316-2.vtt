WEBVTT

00:07.759 --> 00:08.635
Hey, bud.

00:09.010 --> 00:12.222
Brought you some decaf
hazelnut anti-matter.

00:12.806 --> 00:14.974
Just a little treat for my ol' pal,
the Doorman.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.644
Headin' back down, by the way... Ahem.

00:18.937 --> 00:21.523
You sure the Judge is OK with you going
back to Earth so many times?

00:21.564 --> 00:23.900
Oh, yeah, all good. See?

00:24.400 --> 00:25.735
Still got the papers.

00:25.944 --> 00:26.861
Shouldn't be long.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.205
How are we doing, Steve?

00:37.372 --> 00:39.207
I'm trying, I'm getting close.

00:39.791 --> 00:41.876
Good, no pressure.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.089
A-ha!

00:46.172 --> 00:47.966
Someone just went down to Earth

00:48.049 --> 00:50.468
and that gave me a back door
to the Judge's system.

00:50.593 --> 00:53.304
Now we can see everything that's happening
with all four humans.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.766
Excellent work, Steve.

00:59.477 --> 01:02.397
Uh-oh, looks like someone's
been cocooning again.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.942
You know, it would be a real help if you let
me know the next time you're about to--

01:10.780 --> 01:12.407
Well, well, well...

01:13.116 --> 01:15.660
looks like Michael's been caught
with his hand in the human jar.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.829
- Good one, boss!
- Shut up, Glenn!

01:25.420 --> 01:26.671
Morning, Teach!

01:26.754 --> 01:28.256
Ready to discuss philosophy!

01:28.548 --> 01:30.884
Obviously, I'm kidding,
how was your date with Simone?

01:31.050 --> 01:32.051
Spill it, sweetheart.

01:32.427 --> 01:34.554
We had a great time. Thank you, again

01:34.637 --> 01:36.681
for bullying me into asking her out.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.057
Well, I owed it to you.

01:38.850 --> 01:42.812
And, bonus, I realised I was practising
virtue ethics

01:42.896 --> 01:44.689
by helping the two of you bone down.

01:44.898 --> 01:48.401
OK, not appropriate, also not a great
understanding of virtue ethics.

01:48.568 --> 01:50.904
- Well, we can agree to disagree.
- But, if you must know...

01:51.321 --> 01:53.406
it was very chaste, we didn't even kiss.

01:54.866 --> 01:57.160
- Because you chickened out?
- I did, yeah!

01:57.243 --> 02:00.538
I totally chickened out
and I am so mad at myself.

02:00.747 --> 02:01.706
Well, hey...

02:01.956 --> 02:03.541
Maybe it wasn't the right moment.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.586
Knowing the two of you nerds,
your first kiss is gonna be

02:06.669 --> 02:09.088
while reading Plato in an MRI machine.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.134
Oh, hang on.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.636
Come with me.

02:15.303 --> 02:18.139
Simone, what's the one thing Eleanor
and I have in common?

02:18.223 --> 02:20.350
You both have a complete disregard
for my office hours?

02:20.391 --> 02:21.768
- Sorry, Reginald.
- Ah, no worries.

02:21.851 --> 02:23.186
Look, listen, Eleanor is

02:23.269 --> 02:24.604
- an Arizona trash bag...
- Yep.

02:24.687 --> 02:25.813
- Her words, not mine.
- Totally.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.732
Who has a complete disregard for ethics

02:27.982 --> 02:29.776
and once told me that her greatest
accomplishment was

02:29.859 --> 02:31.486
breaking into Charles Barkley's house.

02:31.611 --> 02:34.989
Mm, he was on the road,
I snuck in through the doggy door

02:35.073 --> 02:36.866
tried on all his giant shoes...

02:36.950 --> 02:38.534
One of my top five Christmases.

02:38.660 --> 02:40.495
Listen, the point is...

02:40.662 --> 02:43.373
Eleanor and I have nothing in common

02:43.456 --> 02:47.085
except that we both almost died
and it made us want to be better people.

02:47.543 --> 02:48.920
This is my thesis idea.

02:49.087 --> 02:52.507
I will explore the effect
of near death experiences

02:52.590 --> 02:54.217
on ethical decision making.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.470
I will get a group of people together
who have had near death experiences

02:57.553 --> 03:00.390
ask them ethical questions
and see if there's any commonality.

03:00.598 --> 03:01.557
That's great.

03:01.891 --> 03:03.309
Why are you yelling it at me?

03:03.393 --> 03:07.814
Because I need your help!
You and your magic brain scan machine.

03:08.064 --> 03:09.774
Oh, of course!

03:09.983 --> 03:11.943
A joint study
with the neuroscience department.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.987
We can use MRI mapping to see if

03:14.070 --> 03:15.655
a near death experience
alters brain function.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.115
There's something there, right?

03:17.240 --> 03:18.449
Definitely, I love this.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.159
Great. Also, I wanted
to kiss you last night

03:20.201 --> 03:21.411
but I chickened out,
so I'm gonna kiss you now.

03:21.494 --> 03:22.704
Good, yes, I want that, please.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.128
Oh, sorry Reginald.

03:30.336 --> 03:33.298
- What were you saying?
- Um, that I can't come to class tomorrow

03:33.381 --> 03:34.465
cos my grandma died.

03:34.757 --> 03:35.717
Ouf!

03:36.175 --> 03:37.593
Real mood ruiner!

03:38.052 --> 03:39.595
Read the room, dude!

03:47.395 --> 03:48.479
Bingo!

03:49.230 --> 03:50.148
OK.

03:52.483 --> 03:53.568
Oh, good, you're here.

03:53.776 --> 03:57.363
Eleanor, meet the newest member
of our ethical neuroscientific study

03:57.447 --> 03:58.448
Tahani Al-Jamil.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.242
Hello, Eleanor. Delighted to meet you.

04:01.868 --> 04:04.704
Al-Jamil, oh... you're Camila's sister!

04:05.413 --> 04:06.873
I am, yes.

04:06.956 --> 04:09.959
If you want an autograph
or something, I can probably arrange it.

04:10.043 --> 04:11.919
Eh, I was never really that into her.

04:12.003 --> 04:12.920
No offence.

04:13.296 --> 04:17.383
Oh, I assure you, there is none taken.

04:17.675 --> 04:20.011
So, how did you come to join our team?

04:20.178 --> 04:23.389
Well, it's a bit of a story, I suppose.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.725
It began about a year ago.

04:36.778 --> 04:37.862
Well done, Tahani.

04:38.363 --> 04:39.364
Who saved me?

04:39.781 --> 04:41.491
Did anyone see who just saved my life?

04:41.574 --> 04:44.118
- It was Camila!
- No, it was a man, I think.

04:44.202 --> 04:45.161
It was Camila!

04:45.495 --> 04:48.289
- Camila!
- No, it wasn't Camila!

04:48.414 --> 04:49.957
It was someone over there.

04:50.625 --> 04:53.044
Camila! Camila! Camila!

04:55.880 --> 04:57.673
<i>I had almost died.</i>

04:58.674 --> 04:59.967
<i>In that very moment</i>

05:00.510 --> 05:02.303
<i>I decided to change my life.</i>

05:02.845 --> 05:07.517
<i>First I cleansed myself of all the worldly
possessions that had been weighing me down</i>

05:07.600 --> 05:11.813
<i>like anchors: the dresses, the jewels.
I gave them all to good Will.</i>

05:11.979 --> 05:15.733
That's what I call Prince William.
Since he'd married a commoner I...

05:16.442 --> 05:19.028
assumed he knew some needy people
they could go to.

05:20.029 --> 05:20.905
Sure.

05:21.030 --> 05:24.784
<i>Then I deleted all my celebrity
contacts from my mobile.</i>

05:25.034 --> 05:26.119
Goodbye, Bono.

05:27.203 --> 05:28.538
Goodbye, The Edge.

05:29.705 --> 05:32.583
Goodbye, The Edge's real phone number
that even Bono doesn't have.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.380
<i>And most importantly, I put
physical distance between me and my old life.</i>

05:37.755 --> 05:39.173
Book me a flight to Tibet.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.134
I'm going to live in a Buddhist monastery.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.927
I need to get out of the spotlight.

05:43.136 --> 05:45.054
Copy that,
I'll see what jets are available.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.515
No, I'm flying commercial.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.892
- OK, first class, I assume?
- No.

05:50.226 --> 05:52.478
I'm a woman of the people now.

05:54.981 --> 05:56.607
Comfort plus.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.571
<i>And there, in that humble monastery</i>

06:02.321 --> 06:05.491
<i>thousands of miles from the meaningless
concerns of high society.</i>

06:06.200 --> 06:08.661
<i>I embarked upon a quest for enlightenment.</i>

06:09.537 --> 06:12.498
<i>I learned to embrace a life of simplicity.</i>

06:13.249 --> 06:14.250
<i>I meditated.</i>

06:15.918 --> 06:17.211
<i>I worked.</i>

06:17.879 --> 06:19.714
<i>I gave back to Mother Earth</i>

06:20.548 --> 06:21.883
<i>and I slept.</i>

06:23.134 --> 06:25.928
<i>My soul had never felt so nourished.</i>

06:26.637 --> 06:30.057
<i>Until one day, my former life
came knocking at the open space</i>

06:30.266 --> 06:33.394
<i>where a door would have been
if we were given any privacy.</i>

06:33.644 --> 06:34.645
Yo!

06:35.146 --> 06:36.397
Is that Tahani Al-Jamil?

06:36.606 --> 06:38.316
Man, it totes is you.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.651
What up, I'm Colby, Squalor News.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.113
What are you doing in this monastery?

06:44.197 --> 06:47.492
Oh, we're doing a new show
about poverty, drug lords, gun running

06:47.658 --> 06:50.786
weird ass restaurants, skateboarding and...
oh, and also genocide.

06:50.995 --> 06:52.330
It's called "Society Is Effed".

06:52.622 --> 06:53.789
What are <i>you</i> doing here, though?

06:53.873 --> 06:55.750
Is this where you came
after your sister saved your life?

06:56.667 --> 07:01.255
I am living here as a way to shed
my desire for attention.

07:01.547 --> 07:04.133
"Toight!" That's what's up.
You gotta shed that, right?

07:04.383 --> 07:05.968
But listen If you ever want us to do like

07:06.052 --> 07:08.971
a monster profile on you
and your monk junk

07:09.096 --> 07:10.640
would be honoured AF.

07:10.723 --> 07:14.769
I think people would be "supes" interested
in what you're doing here. For real.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.063
Look, here's my card.
Think about it.

07:17.730 --> 07:20.608
<i>Of course I never called him
to do that profile</i>

07:20.691 --> 07:24.529
<i>because I didn't pursue a life of
tranquillity to get in front of a camera.</i>

07:25.154 --> 07:28.199
<i>I did it to get out of the spotlight.</i>

07:28.991 --> 07:30.868
And that's what my book is about.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.413
Shedding your need for validation
from others.

07:40.336 --> 07:43.631
Publisher says you'll hit
two million copies sold by next week.

07:44.257 --> 07:48.052
Your "Five Hundred Eighty-Two Questions
With" video was nominated for a BAFTA.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.263
- Oh, that's fun.
- Also, they want you for Oprah.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.891
- Oprah's off the air.
- No, they want you to take over for Oprah.

07:54.350 --> 07:55.893
Also this investor wants to meet you.

07:56.227 --> 07:57.603
I checked him out, he's legit.

07:58.646 --> 07:59.605
Tahani!

08:00.231 --> 08:01.315
Gordon Indigo.

08:01.566 --> 08:04.527
I just have to say, you are so inspiring.

08:04.694 --> 08:05.695
Aw...

08:06.487 --> 08:07.989
<i>- Namaste.</i>
- I mean...

08:08.072 --> 08:10.074
you really have all these idiots fooled.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.325
- Excuse me?
- Listen.

08:11.409 --> 08:15.079
I'm sure you're already rolling in dough
from this incredible scam

08:15.288 --> 08:16.998
but have you thought about merch?

08:17.081 --> 08:18.749
Because we could, uh...
we could partner here.

08:18.833 --> 08:22.920
I made a fortune selling Nirvana orbs
which is to say...

08:24.297 --> 08:26.841
driving range golf balls
that I painted silver.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.969
- That's awful!
- No, it's healing!

08:30.803 --> 08:31.846
Wink!

08:31.929 --> 08:34.432
I mean, you should be selling candles

08:34.599 --> 08:37.226
prayer robes, meditation gum...

08:37.643 --> 08:39.061
whatever crap you can think of

08:39.145 --> 08:41.355
- cos these people will buy it.
- That is quite enough.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.858
And how dare you insinuate
that I'm not authentic.

08:44.025 --> 08:45.276
I've finished signing your headshots.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.528
- Oh! Not now!
- Miss Al-Jamil

08:47.945 --> 08:48.988
it's OK.

08:49.322 --> 08:50.740
You and I are the same.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.700
I love what you're doing here.

08:52.992 --> 08:54.619
You get to be rich and famous.

08:54.827 --> 08:57.496
And not have to do any of the work
of helping people.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.540
But I am helping people.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.209
- You need to go, right now.
- Suit yourself.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.629
Look, if you change your mind,
I'm online.

09:04.712 --> 09:08.341
Just google, "Crystals that prevent
erectile dysfunction."

09:09.842 --> 09:12.511
I'm sorry, but Miss Al-Jamil
doesn't have time

09:12.637 --> 09:16.432
to participate in an "ethical study"
at some random university.

09:16.974 --> 09:21.062
If you want to meet her, you can sign up
for the "Get Out of the Spotlight" cruise

09:21.270 --> 09:24.065
with special guests Deepak Chopra
and Will.I.Am...

09:26.150 --> 09:27.109
Hello?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.320
This is Tahani Al-Jamil.

09:29.445 --> 09:31.572
<i>Oh, uh, hi. I didn't think
I'd actually get you.</i>

09:31.697 --> 09:33.616
My name is Chidi Anagonye

09:33.699 --> 09:38.037
and I'm doing an academic
study on near-death experiences

09:38.120 --> 09:39.455
and ethical decision-making.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.124
<i>- I read an article about you--</i>
- Will it help people?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.543
That's all I want to know.
Will this help people?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.088
Yes, I... I, I think so. I mean...

09:48.089 --> 09:49.924
- that's the goal.
- Send me the info.

09:50.508 --> 09:51.884
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.262
Wow.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.391
How had you learned about me, I wonder?

09:58.474 --> 10:02.061
A professor I'd never heard of
named Charles Brainman

10:02.144 --> 10:05.564
sent me an article about you,
said you'd be perfect for our study.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.483
Well, welcome to Australia!

10:07.775 --> 10:09.193
Oh, if you need a place to crash

10:09.276 --> 10:11.737
while you get settled,
my motel has a pull-out sofa.

10:12.405 --> 10:15.783
Although, as I say that, and I look at you
and your whole thing

10:15.866 --> 10:18.953
realise that's absurd, and you should
probably just get your own place.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.623
Yes, I... I think that's, uh... best.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.291
- But... but thank you!
- Mm-hm.

10:27.878 --> 10:28.963
Three down.

10:30.214 --> 10:31.257
One to go.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.470
'Sup, bud!

10:36.762 --> 10:37.888
I've been lookin' for you!

10:38.347 --> 10:40.683
- Oh, sorry, are these your rocks?
- No.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.102
Look, my name is Zack Pizazz

10:43.561 --> 10:44.854
international talent scout.

10:45.438 --> 10:48.107
I've been tracking your dance troupe, man.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.775
I think you really got the goods!

10:50.067 --> 10:51.777
I want you to come on down to Australia

10:52.194 --> 10:54.613
and start a new crew.
Alright, I'll pay for everything.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.449
May have a few other obligations,
but basically...

10:56.615 --> 10:59.076
Uh, thanks, but no thanks, man.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.453
I'm done with dancing.

11:00.995 --> 11:04.373
But... wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa... you...
you heard what my name was, right?

11:05.624 --> 11:08.586
- Zack Pizazz?
- My life is just kinda messed up right now.

11:08.878 --> 11:10.212
I had a really tough year.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.382
I'm sorry.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.844
I'm sorry. Want to talk about it?
I'm a pretty good listener.

11:17.595 --> 11:19.555
Well, my year...

11:20.181 --> 11:21.849
started about a year ago.

11:24.143 --> 11:27.354
Pillboi? I can't breathe and I'm freaking out
and I'm almost out of whip-its!

11:27.730 --> 11:31.942
- Pillboi!
- Buongiorno! Buongiorno!

11:35.321 --> 11:36.989
Yo! What happened?

11:37.198 --> 11:39.784
I couldn't breathe.
The snorkel must have been broken!

11:40.326 --> 11:41.285
Yo, that sucks!

11:42.578 --> 11:44.705
- You ready to get back in there?
- No, man!

11:46.123 --> 11:47.333
We're not doing this no more.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.794
I almost died trying to rob
a Mexican restaurant.

11:52.046 --> 11:53.130
I have to change my life.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.011
I know what I'm gonna do.

12:03.432 --> 12:06.352
I'm gonna win this dance competition.

12:06.852 --> 12:09.688
So you didn't see any other posters there?

12:09.814 --> 12:10.856
No, don't think so, why?

12:11.565 --> 12:12.775
It doesn't matter, continue.

12:13.150 --> 12:16.028
Homies, I almost died yesterday.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.447
But we've been given a second chance.

12:19.031 --> 12:23.744
Three months from today, on this very stage,
in the Carmen Electra Auditorium

12:24.453 --> 12:27.122
right here at the Smith & Wesson
Performing Arts Centre

12:27.206 --> 12:28.582
and "A.T.V." Repair Shop

12:29.416 --> 12:31.168
we are going to win this...

12:31.794 --> 12:33.254
dance competition.

12:33.838 --> 12:35.172
How? You ask.

12:35.589 --> 12:40.886
By working. We are going to eat,
breathe, and vape dance.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.806
I want you thinking about dance 24/7.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.600
That means every day you think
20 thoughts about dance

12:46.725 --> 12:48.644
for seven minutes.

12:48.811 --> 12:52.606
And if you can't promise me that you'll give
this dance crew everything that you've got

12:52.857 --> 12:54.608
then you can walk out that door...

12:55.734 --> 12:56.902
right now.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.614
- Yep, OK. I'm out.
- What?

13:01.115 --> 13:03.367
Come on, Donkey Doug!
After all we've been through?

13:03.576 --> 13:07.538
Listen, you know you're my boy,
but this sounds like a lotta work. Good luck.

13:09.999 --> 13:10.958
Pew pew!

13:12.710 --> 13:14.253
Donkey Doug out!

13:17.047 --> 13:18.674
Damn. That's a tough blow.

13:18.883 --> 13:21.468
But, now that those guys are no longer
members of our crew

13:21.802 --> 13:23.721
we can legally rob their houses!

13:23.888 --> 13:26.432
No, Li'l Peanut! We're gonna do this
the right way.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.977
No more crime! And if you don't like that,
you can walk out that door...

13:31.228 --> 13:32.187
right now.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.693
Wh--? Gah... Come on...

13:39.153 --> 13:41.071
We still got like thirty-five people, so...

13:41.238 --> 13:42.364
let's get to work.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.534
<i>Quick announcement.</i>

13:45.868 --> 13:48.871
<i>Will the owner of a 1998 Toyota Tercel</i>

13:48.954 --> 13:51.540
<i>with golden pythons painted on both sides</i>

13:51.624 --> 13:55.085
<i>license plate "GOT MILF"
please see an usher?</i>

13:55.628 --> 13:57.129
<i>Your car has exploded.</i>

13:57.588 --> 13:58.964
<i>Alright, y'all ready for the next act?</i>

13:59.423 --> 14:03.761
<i>Please give it up right now
for "Dance Dance Resolution!"</i>

14:23.822 --> 14:26.116
<i>In the six-year history of this competition</i>

14:26.200 --> 14:29.536
<i>no crew has ever received a perfect score
from our judges.</i>

14:29.912 --> 14:31.080
<i>That changed tonight.</i>

14:31.330 --> 14:34.083
<i>But before we get to that,
"Dance Dance Resolution"</i>

14:34.416 --> 14:35.459
<i>has been disqualified.</i>

14:35.793 --> 14:37.419
What? No!

14:37.795 --> 14:40.923
- Why?
<i>- Because you have 40 people on stage.</i>

14:41.340 --> 14:42.633
<i>The limit is eight.</i>

14:42.883 --> 14:45.970
<i>Also one of your members tried
to carjack me on my way in here.</i>

14:46.178 --> 14:47.805
No, that was Donkey Doug

14:47.888 --> 14:51.016
and he's not a part
of our crew anymore. We win. We win.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.644
We win! We win! We win!

14:53.727 --> 14:56.730
<i>No, again, you are disqualified.</i>

14:57.564 --> 14:59.066
<i>And the winner is...</i>

14:59.692 --> 15:01.151
<i>"Panther Blood"!</i>

15:01.860 --> 15:03.153
<i>And the winner is...</i>

15:03.988 --> 15:05.322
<i>"Suck Monsters".</i>

15:06.490 --> 15:07.992
<i>And the winner is...</i>

15:08.617 --> 15:12.121
<i>Nobody. All teams are disqualified,
due to violence.</i>

15:13.414 --> 15:14.999
OK, well...

15:15.416 --> 15:17.334
We're out of rent money, so...

15:17.751 --> 15:19.920
remember that thing I said
about "no more crime"?

15:21.213 --> 15:22.923
That's over now, go do crime.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.094
- Yeah, he just confessed to the robbery.
- Dammit!

15:27.136 --> 15:28.053
<i>That was easy!</i>

15:28.137 --> 15:29.596
Look, please let me go.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.391
I only did it to pay rent for
my dance crew's rehearsal space.

15:32.558 --> 15:33.892
Oh, well then you're in luck.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.812
We only arrest people for robbery
if they don't have a reason.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.024
Sorry it took me so long to bail you out.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.192
Nah, it was my fault.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.487
I shouldn't have used my one phone call
to prank the police department.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.907
Man, a year ago I almost died

15:49.199 --> 15:51.243
and I'm exactly the same as I was before.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.079
- A failure.
- You're not a failure.

15:54.538 --> 15:55.706
You're a dreamer.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.667
Look, I like my job at the old folks home.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.502
Those old biddies are sweet

16:00.753 --> 16:03.505
and sometimes they give me
what they think are candy

16:03.756 --> 16:05.674
but are really loose Vicodin.

16:06.383 --> 16:10.137
But when I'm with you,
I feel like the sky's the limit.

16:10.512 --> 16:14.433
I feel like someday I'll be able to buy
my own Vicodin.

16:15.309 --> 16:19.229
And it'll never turn out
to actually be laxatives.

16:19.897 --> 16:22.858
Thanks, dawg. But if my life ended today

16:23.525 --> 16:24.610
what would my legacy be?

16:25.277 --> 16:28.697
Sure, I did a wheelie on a dirt bike
through an entire Waffle House...

16:29.740 --> 16:32.993
and I was once interviewed on the news
for finding a foot on the beach

16:33.952 --> 16:37.331
but, yo, other than that I have
no truly great accomplishments.

16:37.831 --> 16:38.832
Bro...

16:39.666 --> 16:41.627
Bro, I'm only saying
this because I love you.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.130
Do you want a Vicodin right now?

16:46.298 --> 16:48.050
So I walked out of that bar

16:48.634 --> 16:49.927
came down to this wharf

16:50.260 --> 16:51.595
threw a rock at a snake

16:51.804 --> 16:53.889
met a guy named Zack Pizazz

16:54.181 --> 16:56.016
talked to him about
my crazy year that I've had

16:56.100 --> 16:58.310
which started
when I was locked in a safe...

16:58.393 --> 16:59.561
No, that was me.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.063
I'm Zack Pizazz.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.440
- We're caught up now.
- Oh, yeah.

17:03.649 --> 17:05.901
A year ago, if you had asked me

17:05.984 --> 17:07.694
to run a dance crew in Atlantis--

17:07.778 --> 17:10.322
- Australia.
- I would have said "yes", for sure.

17:10.739 --> 17:14.952
But now, and I know this sounds crazy...

17:16.453 --> 17:18.705
but I'm starting to think
there might be more to life

17:18.789 --> 17:21.416
than amateur
street dancing competitions.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.212
It's funny,
but I know exactly what you mean.

17:26.672 --> 17:29.842
My goal in life used to be
completely different too.

17:31.135 --> 17:35.514
I used to rep this crew called...
"The Demons."

17:35.848 --> 17:37.850
- Wow.
- I remember you guys!

17:38.267 --> 17:41.311
Didn't you all die when someone brought
a hammerhead shark into your hot tub?

17:42.020 --> 17:43.063
Different demons.

17:43.772 --> 17:47.067
The point is, I had to leave
my old crew behind

17:47.151 --> 17:50.112
you know, but I met new friends,
who helped me become...

17:51.155 --> 17:53.157
a better person.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.578
Look, I know this group of people
who are also searching for meaning.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.205
They might be able to help you find
what you're looking for.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.957
What do you think? You wanna meet them?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.335
Yeah, that sounds great.

18:07.171 --> 18:08.463
Do we have to leave right now?

18:08.881 --> 18:11.341
My friend gave me a pill
that I realised one second ago

18:11.425 --> 18:12.843
was definitely a laxative...

18:13.177 --> 18:14.511
No, go, go!

18:16.430 --> 18:20.017
Well, that is the last time
I'll need to head back down there.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.602
So, to thank you for your help

18:21.852 --> 18:23.770
I brought you back something from Earth.

18:24.188 --> 18:25.939
A little token of my appreciation.

18:26.231 --> 18:30.527
It keeps your anti-matter
warmer, for longer!

18:35.324 --> 18:36.700
- It's a frog!
- Yeah.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.493
- There's a frog on it.
- Yeah.

18:39.494 --> 18:40.704
Right there, it's a frog!

18:41.163 --> 18:43.457
Oh, man, it's great. It's classic.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.209
Oh, this guy's a jumper, you can tell.

18:45.751 --> 18:47.252
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:49.630 --> 18:52.758
Wow, that... really went over big.

18:56.511 --> 18:57.888
How's Jason? Is he still cute?

18:58.138 --> 19:00.015
- Uh... he looks about the same.
- That's sounds cute.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.142
- Hi, guys.
- Oh...

19:02.226 --> 19:04.061
- Hey.
- Long time no see.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.479
- Yeah.
- How's it going?

19:05.646 --> 19:08.023
So good. I mean, everything is going
according to plan

19:08.106 --> 19:10.776
and nothing is going differently
from the plan.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.362
Yes, that's a very not weird way to put it.

19:13.612 --> 19:15.822
- I'm just stretching my legs.
- Oh.

19:16.114 --> 19:19.451
Just binged like 300 episodes of <i>NCIS</i>

19:19.576 --> 19:21.995
- Ooh!
- You know, I'm not a human woman

19:22.162 --> 19:24.998
that Mark Harmon can "get it".

19:25.332 --> 19:27.167
You know what I'm sayin'?

19:27.251 --> 19:29.628
Speaking of human cutie pies,
how's that Chidi doing?

19:29.753 --> 19:31.129
Oh, sorry, Judge. Let me just...

19:31.213 --> 19:33.048
Oh, hey! You know what you would love

19:33.131 --> 19:34.424
- if you like Mark Harmon?
- Uh-huh?

19:34.508 --> 19:37.678
"Stealing Home". He is very sexy
in "Stealing Home"

19:37.761 --> 19:40.514
according to the private thoughts of more
than seven million Caucasian women.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.433
Oh, hot tip! Thanks y'all.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.018
- You guys wanna come with?
- Ooh...

19:45.102 --> 19:47.646
We can watch together,
I can whip up some nachos...

19:47.896 --> 19:49.940
I am incapable of eating, so...

19:50.023 --> 19:52.150
Suit yourselves, party poopers.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.527
Huh, party poopers!

19:53.610 --> 19:55.195
I guess it'll be just me and Mark, then.

19:55.279 --> 19:58.824
Naughty, naughty!

19:59.074 --> 20:02.577
Oh, boy. Michael,
we almost just got busted.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.663
Yeah, but we didn't and more importantly...

20:05.414 --> 20:07.291
Jason just arrived in Australia.

20:07.457 --> 20:11.086
The four of them are finally together.
Oh, we did it, Janet.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.421
We got away with it.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.426
So, this is our MRI machine.

20:17.509 --> 20:18.719
Oh, don't... don't touch that.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.096
Each of you will get a chance
in here eventually.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.140
Hopefully, none of you's claustrophobic?

20:23.348 --> 20:26.727
Claws-naphobic? Who would ever
be scared of Santa Claus?

20:26.810 --> 20:29.521
Oh, the Jewish.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.897
You from Florida?

20:31.398 --> 20:32.649
- Jacksonville.
- Yeah!

20:32.899 --> 20:35.110
That should be fine for me.
It's roughly the same size

20:35.193 --> 20:37.696
as Nicole Kidman's cryogenic
anti-aging chamber

20:37.779 --> 20:39.531
and I've never had a
problem in there, so...

20:40.073 --> 20:41.033
I'll be OK, too.

20:41.366 --> 20:44.244
It kinda reminds me of the home
tanning booth I lost my virginity in.

20:44.494 --> 20:47.247
Wow. I cannot wait to take a look
at these three brains.

20:47.789 --> 20:51.418
Oh, forgot to mention. There's one more
person who will be joining us.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.712
Seems like a really interesting guy.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.756
He was almost run over by a train
a few months ago

20:55.839 --> 20:57.215
heard about the study,
emailed me last night.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.177
This doesn't make any sense.

21:02.763 --> 21:03.847
They're all there.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.557
What's going on?

21:06.683 --> 21:07.684
Oh, no.

21:08.643 --> 21:11.855
- What is it?
- Something bad, Janet, something

21:12.939 --> 21:13.940
very dark...

21:15.233 --> 21:16.193
and evil.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.487
Oh, yes. Come on in.

21:18.779 --> 21:19.654
Everyone...

21:20.113 --> 21:22.407
- this is Trevor.
- Hey, guys.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.951
It is so great to meet you.
