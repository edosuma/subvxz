WEBVTT

00:05.626 --> 00:07.628
SO I GAVE UP BACON ART

00:07.628 --> 00:09.340
AFTER I MADE
A BACON FIRE HYDRANT,

00:09.340 --> 00:11.552
AND NEARLY WENT NUTS OVER
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

00:14.095 --> 00:17.188
IT'S MY TOILET, IT'S MY LUNCH.
IT'S MY TOILET, IT'S MY LUNCH,

00:17.188 --> 00:19.690
IT'S MY TOILET
AND MY LUNCH.

00:19.690 --> 00:22.853
SO THAT WAS MY DAY.

00:22.853 --> 00:24.985
NOW THAT MY BLOGGING
IS DONE FOR THE NIGHT,

00:24.985 --> 00:27.318
LET'S SEE WHAT'S
GOING ON AT SUMNER PARK.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.450
OOH, THERE'S AN EVENT
COMING UP.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.322
Man: I'M TOM FAIRBANKS,

00:31.322 --> 00:34.205
THE BILLIONAIRE PHILANTHROPIST
AND INVENTOR.

00:34.205 --> 00:37.288
( chuckles )
OH, WAIT,
YOU CAN'T SEE ME.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.039
THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M WEARING

00:39.039 --> 00:41.122
THE TOM FAIRBANKS
STEALTH SUIT.

00:41.122 --> 00:42.713
ONLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:42.713 --> 00:44.965
PAYS FOR ITSELF IN
ALL THE FREE MOVIES

00:44.965 --> 00:46.667
YOU GET TO
SNEAK INTO.

00:46.667 --> 00:48.339
OVER TIME.

00:48.339 --> 00:51.302
LOTS OF...
LOTS OF TIME.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.434
TOM FAIRBANKS!

00:53.434 --> 00:55.436
WHAT'S HE DOING
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD PARK?

00:55.436 --> 00:57.228
AND WHY DID I PAUSE THE VIDEO

00:57.228 --> 00:58.769
WHEN THAT VERY QUESTION
IS, NO DOUBT,

00:58.769 --> 01:00.851
ABOUT TO BE ANSWERED?

01:00.851 --> 01:03.104
I'LL BE SHOWING OFF
THIS INVENTION

01:03.104 --> 01:04.645
AND MANY OTHERS THIS WEEKEND

01:04.645 --> 01:06.317
AT MY ANIMAL RESCUE
CHARITY FUNDRAISER

01:06.317 --> 01:08.028
RIGHT HERE IN
SUMNER PARK.

01:08.028 --> 01:11.742
- LET'S GO, LADIES.
- ( women giggling )

01:13.114 --> 01:15.035
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT,
ROBERT?

01:15.035 --> 01:17.288
TOM FAIRBANKS
IS COMING.

01:17.288 --> 01:18.999
ROBERT? ROBERT?

01:18.999 --> 01:22.002
ARE YOU IN ONE OF THOSE
INVISIBLE SUITS, TOO?

01:22.002 --> 01:24.004
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

01:24.004 --> 01:26.207
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU WOULDN'T BE WEARING

01:26.207 --> 01:27.838
A STEALTH SUIT.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.840
YOU LOVE
SHOWIN' OFF THAT BOD.

01:34.765 --> 01:36.807
TOM FAIRBANKS
IS THE WORLD'S

01:36.807 --> 01:38.719
MOST AWESOME,
OUTRAGEOUS
RICH GUY.

01:38.719 --> 01:41.142
JUST LAST MONTH,
HE BOUGHT AN ACTIVE VOLCANO

01:41.142 --> 01:43.184
JUST TO OPEN
A LAVA-THEMED RESTAURANT.

01:43.184 --> 01:45.276
IT BURNED DOWN IN TWO HOURS
FROM A GREASE FIRE.

01:45.276 --> 01:47.728
NO ONE SAW THAT COMING.

01:47.728 --> 01:49.940
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET IN TO MEET HIM.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.363
- I JUST WISH
WE HAD TICKETS.
- I HAVE TICKS.

01:52.363 --> 01:54.155
I ALSO HAVE FLEAS
AND RINGWORM.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.616
WILL ANY OF THOSE
GET US IN?

01:55.616 --> 01:59.330
I SHOULD REALLY BE TRYING
TO GET IN TO SEE A VET.

01:59.330 --> 02:00.831
I KNOW HOW
WE CAN GET IN.

02:00.831 --> 02:02.833
TUNNEL IN OVER
A PERIOD OF YEARS

02:02.833 --> 02:04.455
USING A SPOON,
AND DISPOSING OF THE DIRT

02:04.455 --> 02:06.877
IN THE YARD DURING
EXERCISE TIME?

02:06.877 --> 02:09.710
I WAS GONNA SAY WE COULD
JUST ASK AVERY FOR HELP.

02:09.710 --> 02:13.254
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?
- HOW DID YOU GET IN?

02:13.254 --> 02:15.716
I USED SOMETHING
CALLED A COMPUTER,

02:15.716 --> 02:17.808
WENT ON SOMETHING
CALLED THE INTERNET,

02:17.808 --> 02:20.100
AND BOUGHT SOMETHING
CALLED A TICKET.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.603
RESPECT.

02:22.603 --> 02:24.475
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET
TOM FAIRBANKS.

02:24.475 --> 02:26.527
I ADMIRE THE WAY
HE GIVES BACK,

02:26.527 --> 02:29.149
ALL THE ANIMALS HE'S SAVED.
SUCH AN INSPIRATION.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.401
I LOVE HIM, TOO.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.773
ALWAYS DOING CHARITY STUFF
FOR ANIMALS.

02:32.773 --> 02:35.035
WELL, I LOVE
WHAT HE DOES FOR DOGS.

02:35.035 --> 02:37.698
HIS CAT WORK
IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY.

02:37.698 --> 02:39.910
I WANT HIM TO SIGN
MY COPY OF HIS BOOK,

02:39.910 --> 02:42.042
IF I CAN SUCCEED,
SO CAN YOU,

02:42.042 --> 02:44.455
BUT PROBABLY
NOT AS MUCH AS ME.

02:44.455 --> 02:47.878
IF I'VE LEARNED
ANYTHING FROM TOM FAIRBANKS,
IT'S THAT YOU NEVER STOP,

02:47.878 --> 02:49.920
UNLESS YOU COME TO
A RED LIGHT OR A STOP SIGN.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.502
IT'S ALL IN
HIS DRIVING MANUAL

02:51.502 --> 02:53.294
IF I CAN DRIVE,
SO CAN YOU,

02:53.294 --> 02:55.216
BUT PROBABLY
NOT AS MUCH AS ME.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.600
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA GET US
ALL IN TROUBLE.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.303
YOU GUYS ARE
ALL IN TROUBLE.

03:02.303 --> 03:04.565
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ONCE I USE

03:04.565 --> 03:06.267
THE TOM FAIRBANKS
STEALTH SUIT?

03:12.152 --> 03:13.984
THERE'S NOTHING
HERE, IS THERE?

03:31.332 --> 03:34.755
♪ HOUSEWORK TAKES ME
WAY TOO LONG ♪

03:34.755 --> 03:38.008
♪ AT LEAST I HAVE
THE WHISTLING SONG ♪

03:38.008 --> 03:40.931
( blows air )

03:42.513 --> 03:44.935
I LOVE THAT SONG.

03:46.807 --> 03:48.148
CHLOE, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

03:48.148 --> 03:50.311
I'M DUSTING
FOR FINGERPRINTS.

03:50.311 --> 03:53.984
I'M NOT CHLOE,
I'M SAVANNAH SNOOPS,

03:53.984 --> 03:56.317
KID DETECTIVE
AND EQUESTRIAN.

03:56.317 --> 03:58.569
BY THE WAY,
I NEED A HORSE.

03:58.569 --> 04:01.241
HONEY, JUST BECAUSE
YOU READ THOSE
SAVANNAH SNOOPS BOOKS,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.414
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN
GET IN MY WAY.

04:03.414 --> 04:04.995
NOW CLEAN UP THIS MESS.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.827
I WILL, BUT RIGHT NOW,

04:06.827 --> 04:08.539
THE FAMILY ROOM
IS A CRIME SCENE,

04:08.539 --> 04:10.631
AND YOU'RE
MY NUMBER-ONE SUSPECT.

04:10.631 --> 04:13.253
DON'T LEAVE TOWN,
EXCEPT TO TAKE ME
TO THE WATER PARK.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.466
I'M SUPER LOOKING
FORWARD TO THAT.

04:15.466 --> 04:18.429
CHLOE, I'M NOT
PLAYING THIS GAME WITH YOU.

04:18.429 --> 04:21.261
COME ON. YOU NEVER
WANNA PLAY.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.384
PLEASE PLAY WITH ME.

04:23.384 --> 04:25.225
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

04:25.225 --> 04:27.227
OF COURSE I'LL
PLAY WITH YOU, SWEETIE.

04:27.227 --> 04:31.271
NOW, WHERE'D YOU STEAL
THAT RING FROM,
YOU DIRTY HOOLIGAN?

04:31.271 --> 04:35.235
CHLOE, IT IS NOT NICE
TO CALL ME A DIRTY HOOLIGAN.

04:35.235 --> 04:37.528
ACCEPTABLE NAMES ARE
SWEET MOMMY,

04:37.528 --> 04:40.361
MOTHER DEAR,
AND PRETTY MAMA.

04:40.361 --> 04:44.034
WHERE'D YOU STEAL
THAT RING FROM,
YOU SWEET MOMMY?

04:44.034 --> 04:48.248
THIS IS THE ENGAGEMENT
RING YOUR FATHER GAVE ME.

04:48.248 --> 04:50.831
NOT THE ONE I PICKED OUT,
A LITTLE ON THE YELLOW SIDE,

04:50.831 --> 04:53.374
BUT IT'S FINE,
IT'S FINE.

04:53.374 --> 04:55.376
I KNOW YOU AND
THIS "DADDY" CHARACTER

04:55.376 --> 04:57.838
ARE INTERNATIONAL
JEWEL THIEVES.

04:57.838 --> 05:01.011
IT SAYS SO RIGHT HERE.

05:01.011 --> 05:02.593
CHLOE, YOU MADE THAT.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.556
NO. IT WAS MADE BY
SAVANNAH SNOOPS,

05:05.556 --> 05:07.307
KID DETECTIVE,
EQUESTRIAN,

05:07.307 --> 05:09.690
AND BIBLIOPHILE.

05:09.690 --> 05:11.562
BY THE WAY, I NEED
TO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

05:13.143 --> 05:16.276
LOOKS LIKE SAVANNAH SNOOPS
IS ON A CASE.

05:16.276 --> 05:19.069
WHAT DID YOU DO,
YOU DIRTY HOOLIGAN?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.151
BENNETT, SHE'S
TAKING THIS TOO FAR.

05:21.151 --> 05:22.903
IT'S GETTING IN THE WAY
OF MY CLEANING.

05:22.903 --> 05:24.905
WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE
HER CREATIVITY.

05:24.905 --> 05:27.408
BENNETT, SHE HID
A LIPSTICK CAMERA

05:27.408 --> 05:29.079
IN MY LIPSTICK.

05:34.294 --> 05:35.956
WHAT?!

05:38.759 --> 05:41.301
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT BE
OVERREACTING, HONEY?

05:41.301 --> 05:43.263
CHLOE'S JUST DOING
SOME HARMLESS ROLE PLAYING.

05:43.263 --> 05:44.725
I DON'T KNOW,

05:44.725 --> 05:47.057
I JUST GET THE FEELING
SHE'S SPYING ON ME.

05:51.311 --> 05:53.143
WHY ARE YOU
THROWING ME OUT?

05:53.143 --> 05:55.436
I PURCHASED A TICKET
WEEKS IN ADVANCE,

05:55.436 --> 05:56.897
DRESSED APPROPRIATELY,

05:56.897 --> 05:59.239
AND ONLY TOOK
ONE LOBSTER SPRING ROLL

05:59.239 --> 06:01.321
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE
GORGED THEMSELVES.

06:01.321 --> 06:04.985
I SAW WHAT YOU DID,
YOU ANIMALS.

06:04.985 --> 06:07.367
I'M THROWING YOU OUT
BECAUSE YOU HELPED

06:07.367 --> 06:09.199
THIS KID AND HIS DOG
SNEAK IN.

06:09.199 --> 06:11.121
PLUS, IT'S ONE OF
THE FEW PERKS

06:11.121 --> 06:13.123
TO BEING
TOM FAIRBANKS' ASSISTANT.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.995
EXCEPT FOR MAKING
THESE TWO LAUGH.

06:14.995 --> 06:16.837
- LAUGH.
- ( forced laughter )

06:16.837 --> 06:19.339
GLORIOUS.

06:19.339 --> 06:20.921
THERE'S TOM FAIRBANKS!

06:20.921 --> 06:24.214
OVER HERE, WE HAVE SOMETHING
I THINK YOU'RE ALL GONNA LOVE.

06:24.214 --> 06:25.766
IT'S THE TOM FAIRBANKS
CRASH COCOON.

06:25.766 --> 06:28.178
IF YOU WIPE OUT
DOING A DANGEROUS STUNT,

06:28.178 --> 06:30.431
IT WILL ENCASE YOU
IN A PROTECTIVE BUBBLE

06:30.431 --> 06:32.513
BEFORE YOU CAN SAY...
( screams ).

06:32.513 --> 06:34.775
SO INSTEAD YOU GO,
AAAHH... OOH.

06:34.775 --> 06:36.316
WHEE!

06:39.440 --> 06:42.192
I CAN USE THIS
TO HELP TYLER AND AVERY.

06:54.294 --> 06:57.628
PLEASE, MR. FAIRBANKS,
GET ME OUTTA HERE.

06:57.628 --> 06:59.299
WOULD IF I COULD, DOUG.

06:59.299 --> 07:01.341
YOU SEE, THIS IS
A PROTOTYPE,

07:01.341 --> 07:03.043
EMPLOYING THE MOST
CUTTING EDGE

07:03.043 --> 07:05.215
FIBER OPTIC POLYMER
TECHNOLOGY.

07:05.215 --> 07:07.638
AND WE FORGOT
THE ZIPPERS.

07:07.638 --> 07:10.721
OH, BOY,
OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.313
WHOA, WHOSE DOG
IS THIS?

07:13.313 --> 07:15.606
HE'S OUR DOG.

07:15.606 --> 07:17.397
AND I AM
SO EXCITED TO MEET YOU.

07:17.397 --> 07:19.439
I AM MORE EXCITED
THAN SHE IS.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.321
I'M ALSO TALLER
AND HAVE BETTER HAIR.

07:21.321 --> 07:24.444
WHAT A MAJESTIC CREATURE.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.278
LOOK AT THAT FACE,
THOSE EARS, THAT REGAL JAW.

07:28.278 --> 07:30.370
OH, BREATHTAKING.

07:30.370 --> 07:33.914
WELL, I CAN SEE
MY REFLECTION IN HIS EYES.

07:33.914 --> 07:35.876
HE'S QUITE REMARKABLE,
AS WELL.

07:35.876 --> 07:37.498
WHAT'S MY SECRET?

07:37.498 --> 07:39.500
EVERY NIGHT, I HAVE
A REALLY GOOD CRY.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.292
FLUSHES OUT THE SALT
AND THE SORROW.

07:42.292 --> 07:45.676
JUST THIS MORNING,
I WAS SKETCHING THE PERFECT DOG,

07:45.676 --> 07:48.348
AND YOUR DOG
IS AN EXACT MATCH.

07:51.091 --> 07:54.224
I WANT TO HIRE THIS DOG
AS A POSTER DOG FOR
MY ANIMAL RESCUE CHARITY.

07:54.224 --> 07:58.148
HE'LL BE IN
COMMERCIALS AND PRINT ADS
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

07:58.148 --> 08:00.901
HE'LL BE THE MOST
FAMOUS DOG ON THE PLANET.

08:00.901 --> 08:02.983
THAT'S AWESOME!

08:02.983 --> 08:05.155
BUT I'VE HEARD HOW
THESE PHOTO SHOOTS GO.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.317
THE COLLAR STAYS ON.

08:11.572 --> 08:13.664
SO WE'LL WORK OUT
THE DETAILS,

08:13.664 --> 08:15.746
AND GET STAN HERE
WORKING AS THE NEW
POSTER DOG

08:15.746 --> 08:17.327
FOR MY ANIMAL CHARITY,

08:17.327 --> 08:19.710
FAIRBANKS ANIMAL
RESCUE TEAM.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.081
DON'T USE THE INITIALS.

08:21.081 --> 08:24.004
( giggles )
FART.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.256
DON'T ANNOUNCE IT.
JUST SAY "EXCUSE ME."

08:26.256 --> 08:27.588
- ( phone ringing )
- EXCUSE ME.

08:27.588 --> 08:30.551
SEE, THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.723
I CAN'T BELIEVE
TOM FAIRBANKS WANTS ME

08:32.723 --> 08:35.345
TO BE HIS POSTER DOG
FOR ANIMAL RESCUE.

08:35.345 --> 08:37.267
HOW SHOULD I POSE?
OOH, HOW ABOUT LIKE THIS?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.810
I'M A TIGER.
RROWWRR!

08:41.521 --> 08:45.566
OH, FART!
I JUST GOT IT.
NOW THAT MAKES SENSE.

08:47.317 --> 08:49.529
STAN, IF YOU BECOME
A FAMOUS POSTER DOG,

08:49.529 --> 08:52.362
YOU'LL BE RECOGNIZED
EVERYWHERE YOU GO.

08:52.362 --> 08:54.454
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO
ALL THE SPECIAL THINGS YOU DO,

08:54.454 --> 08:56.456
LIKE DRIVE A CAR
AND DANCE THE TANGO,

08:56.456 --> 08:57.788
DRESS UP IN COSTUMES.

08:57.788 --> 09:01.331
I LIVE TO DRESS UP.
LIVE.

09:01.331 --> 09:04.424
WELL, YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO DO IT IN PUBLIC.

09:04.424 --> 09:06.336
IF YOU'RE FAMOUS,

09:06.336 --> 09:08.468
EVERYTHING YOU DO
WILL BE SCRUTINIZED.

09:08.468 --> 09:10.380
IF YOU DO ANYTHING SPECIAL,

09:10.380 --> 09:13.013
PEOPLE WILL REALIZE
YOU'RE MORE THAN JUST
A NORMAL DOG.

09:13.013 --> 09:15.015
STAN, IF YOU TAKE
TOM'S DEAL,

09:15.015 --> 09:17.267
FROM NOW ON,
EVERYWHERE YOU GO,

09:17.267 --> 09:20.270
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE...
JUST A DOG.

09:20.270 --> 09:22.442
IT'S TIMES LIKE THIS

09:22.442 --> 09:24.104
I WISH I'D NEVER DUMPED
MY WITCH GIRLFRIEND BY TEXT

09:24.104 --> 09:25.816
BACK WHEN I WAS
A HUMAN.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.948
- WHAT?
- NO, NO, JUST KIDDING.

09:27.948 --> 09:29.950
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A TALKING DOG.

09:29.950 --> 09:32.242
THOUGH I DID TEXT-DUMP
A WITCH ONCE.

09:35.245 --> 09:39.079
NOW, RUBY, BEFORE WE BEGIN
OUR FIRST SESSION,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.411
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
THIS ROOM IS A SAFE PLACE

09:41.411 --> 09:44.835
WHERE YOU CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE
TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.837
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

09:50.010 --> 09:52.883
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO LEAVE THIS ROOM
FOR A MINUTE.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.976
I WANT YOU TO SIT
OUT HERE AND READ

09:55.976 --> 09:57.477
CHAPTER SEVEN OF MY BOOK,

09:57.477 --> 09:59.309
TRANSFERENCE
AND COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE

09:59.309 --> 10:00.891
IN A PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC
SETTING.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.023
THEN WE'LL DISCUSS, HUH? YAY!

10:06.606 --> 10:07.988
CHLOE.

10:10.230 --> 10:13.944
IT IS OKAY FOR YOU TO READ
YOUR SAVANNAH SNOOPS BOOKS

10:13.944 --> 10:16.196
AND PLAY WITH MOMMY,

10:16.196 --> 10:19.579
BUT IT IS NOT OKAY
FOR YOU TO SPY IN HERE
WHEN I HAVE PATIENTS.

10:19.579 --> 10:22.412
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

10:25.836 --> 10:28.338
MR. FAIRBANKS,
WE'VE CONSIDERED YOUR OFFER,

10:28.338 --> 10:30.420
AND WE HAVE TO SAY NO.

10:30.420 --> 10:31.842
NO?!

10:31.842 --> 10:33.884
WAIT A SECOND.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.886
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN THE WORD "NO."

10:35.886 --> 10:38.428
I ALSO DON'T BELIEVE
KIDS' MEALS SHOULD BE
JUST FOR KIDS.

10:38.428 --> 10:40.681
WHAT IF I WANT TO EAT
A SMALL PORTION OF
CHICKEN FINGERS

10:40.681 --> 10:43.393
WHILE TRYING TO GET
OUT OF THE MAZE WITH
A CRAYON?

10:43.393 --> 10:45.395
I'M SORRY,
MR. FAIRBANKS.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.477
BEING FAMOUS ISN'T
IN STAN'S BEST INTEREST.

10:47.477 --> 10:51.151
WOW, YOU KIDS ARE
REALLY STANDING UP TO ME.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.363
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

10:53.363 --> 10:56.827
I'M GONNA TALK TO
THE REAL DECISION MAKERS,
YOUR PARENTS.

10:56.827 --> 10:58.779
I'LL OFFER THEM
MONEY, POWER,

10:58.779 --> 11:00.781
OWNERSHIP IN
AN UNDERDOG HOCKEY TEAM,

11:00.781 --> 11:02.662
WITH THE ODDS
STACKED AGAINST THEM.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.835
THEY WON'T WIN,
BUT THEY'LL MAKE IT
TO THE FINALS,

11:04.835 --> 11:07.337
TEACHING US ALL
WHAT WINNING REALLY IS.

11:08.749 --> 11:11.712
YOU SEE, I GET
WHAT I WANT.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.554
WELL, I GUESS
WE CAN'T STOP YOU,

11:14.554 --> 11:16.346
OR THE SPIRIT OF
THAT SCRAPPY TEAM.

11:16.346 --> 11:18.138
WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER TONIGHT,

11:18.138 --> 11:20.300
AND WE'LL WORK
THE WHOLE THING OUT?

11:20.300 --> 11:23.894
PERFECT. YOU SEE,
I GET WHAT I WANT.

11:23.894 --> 11:25.145
YOU ALREADY SAID THAT.

11:25.145 --> 11:26.516
I KNOW, BUT I WANTED
THAT TO BE

11:26.516 --> 11:28.358
THE LAST THING I SAY.

11:28.358 --> 11:31.231
YOU SEE, I GET
WHAT I WANT. THERE. OH!

11:31.231 --> 11:33.313
I GET WHAT I WANT.

11:35.615 --> 11:37.407
AVERY, WHY WOULD YOU
INVITE TOM OVER

11:37.407 --> 11:38.949
TO TALK TO OUR PARENTS?

11:38.949 --> 11:40.660
THEY DON'T KNOW
STAN'S SECRET,

11:40.660 --> 11:42.202
SO THEY WON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM MAKING THE DEAL,

11:42.202 --> 11:43.323
ESPECIALLY IF
TOM PRESSURES THEM.

11:43.323 --> 11:44.915
YOU KNOW HOW
MOM AND DAD ARE.

11:44.915 --> 11:46.286
THEY'RE NOT LIKE
OTHER AMERICANS.

11:46.286 --> 11:48.288
THEY'RE IMPRESSED BY
FAMOUS RICH PEOPLE

11:48.288 --> 11:50.330
AND DO WHATEVER
THEY SAY.

11:50.330 --> 11:51.922
TOM IS DETERMINED.

11:51.922 --> 11:54.044
HE IS GOING TO TALK
TO MOM AND DAD.

11:54.044 --> 11:56.296
THIS WAY,
WE CAN TRICK HIM.

11:56.296 --> 11:58.929
I INVITED HIM OVER TONIGHT
BECAUSE MOM AND DAD

11:58.929 --> 12:00.971
WILL BE WITH CHLOE AT
HER HEALTHY MUFFINS MEETING.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.472
WHILE THEY'RE GONE,

12:02.472 --> 12:04.394
WE'LL GET ACTORS
TO PLAY OUR PARENTS,

12:04.394 --> 12:06.016
AND THEY CAN TURN
TOM DOWN.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.978
MY BUDDY DANNY
DOES A GREAT IMPRESSION

12:07.978 --> 12:09.399
OF A CARTOON DUCK.
WILL THAT HELP US?

12:09.399 --> 12:12.352
THAT WON'T EVEN
HELP DANNY.

12:12.352 --> 12:14.985
HEY, AVERY, WHAT ABOUT
EMERSON AND CAROL,

12:14.985 --> 12:17.908
THE RETIRED ACTORS FROM
THE SENIOR CENTER
WE VOLUNTEER AT?

12:17.908 --> 12:19.990
YOU GUYS VOLUNTEER
AT A SENIOR CENTER?

12:19.990 --> 12:22.202
WHERE DO YOU THINK
WE'RE GOING WHEN WE SAY,

12:22.202 --> 12:24.204
"OKAY, WE'RE GOING
TO VOLUNTEER AT
THE SENIOR CENTER NOW"?

12:24.204 --> 12:26.246
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LYING,

12:26.246 --> 12:29.419
LIKE WHEN I SAY,
"OKAY, I'M GONNA VOLUNTEER
AT THE SENIOR CENTER NOW."

12:29.419 --> 12:33.423
WELL, EMERSON AND CAROL
ARE A LITTLE OLD,

12:33.423 --> 12:36.336
BUT I'LL JUST SAY THAT
THEY'RE OUR GRANDPARENTS.

12:36.336 --> 12:37.757
WHO TAKE CARE OF US,
NO PROBLEM.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.509
OKAY, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.431
WE'RE GONNA GET
SOME OLD ACTORS

12:41.431 --> 12:43.553
TO PRETEND TO BE
OUR GUARDIANS
IN ORDER TO TELL

12:43.553 --> 12:45.645
A BILLIONAIRE THAT
HE CAN'T SIGN OUR
SECRET TALKING DOG

12:45.645 --> 12:47.307
- TO A MODELING CONTRACT.
- YES.

12:47.307 --> 12:49.349
I LOVE THIS PLAN.
LET'S DO IT.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.897
IT'S AN EXCITING NIGHT,
CHLOE, BEING AWARDED

12:56.897 --> 12:59.609
A MUSIC BADGE FOR LEARNING
TO PLAY THE TROOP ANTHEM
ON YOUR RECORDER.

12:59.609 --> 13:02.612
I SHOULD GET THE BADGE.
I HAD TO LISTEN TO IT 100 TIMES.

13:02.612 --> 13:04.825
JUST BE HAPPY
THE HEALTHY MUFFINS MEETING

13:04.825 --> 13:06.666
WILL DISTRACT HER FROM
PLAYING SAVANNAH SNOOPS.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.788
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL
WHEN SHE WAS BOTHERING ME,

13:08.788 --> 13:11.211
BUT WHEN SHE DISTURBS
YOUR WORK, IT'S SUDDENLY
A PROBLEM.

13:11.211 --> 13:12.622
CAN WE GO?

13:12.622 --> 13:15.335
AND WHY ARE WE
TALKING LIKE THIS?

13:15.335 --> 13:17.417
HEY, YOU GUYS
NEED TO LEAVE
BEFORE TOM...

13:17.417 --> 13:19.009
...ORROW.

13:19.009 --> 13:21.421
TOMORROW, THE WAY
YOU GUYS ARE LINGERING,

13:21.421 --> 13:23.423
IT'LL BE TOMORROW
BEFORE YOU GET THERE.

13:23.423 --> 13:26.516
I THINK YOU'D WANNA
GET THERE TODD-AY.

13:26.516 --> 13:29.099
TODD-AY.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.811
I ONCE DATED A GUY
NAMED TODD DAY.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.313
NO, IT WAS RON KNIGHT.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.695
NO, IT WAS FRANK JOHNSON,
BUT HE ALSO CONFUSED ME,

13:35.695 --> 13:38.608
MUCH LIKE
THIS CONVERSATION.

13:38.608 --> 13:41.571
SAVANNAH SNOOPS
IS ON THE CASE.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.203
WHY ARE YOU IN A HURRY
TO GET RID OF US?

13:43.203 --> 13:45.035
ARE YOU AND AVERY
UP TO SOMETHING?

13:45.035 --> 13:47.407
CHLOE, AVERY AND I
ARE JUST HANGIN' OUT
AND WATCHING TV.

13:47.407 --> 13:49.119
GO TO YOUR THING
AND LEAVE US ALONE.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.291
AHA! I GOT YOU.

13:51.291 --> 13:54.124
THIS RECORDER
IS ACTUALLY A LIE DETECTOR.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.917
IF YOU'RE LYING,
IT PLAYS "YANKEE DOODLE."

13:56.917 --> 13:59.459
( playing "Yankee Doodle" )

13:59.459 --> 14:02.132
I THOUGHT SO!

14:03.803 --> 14:07.307
- ARE THEY GONE?
- IS THE COAST CLEAR?

14:07.307 --> 14:09.179
YEAH. WHERE'S
THE OLD COUPLE?

14:09.179 --> 14:11.681
THIS ISN'T A THEATER,
IT'S A HOUSE.

14:11.681 --> 14:13.473
YOU TOLD ME WE WERE
ACTING IN A THEATER.

14:13.473 --> 14:16.276
EXCUSE ME FOR
PULLING YOU AWAY
FROM YOUR BUSY EVENING

14:16.276 --> 14:18.688
OF COMPLAINING ABOUT
HOW LOUD THE TELEVISION IS.

14:18.688 --> 14:20.740
IT IS LOUD.
IT'S ALWAYS LOUD.

14:20.740 --> 14:23.323
IT HAS TO BE LOUD
TO HEAR IT OVER YOU.

14:24.444 --> 14:27.787
THEY KIND OF HAVE
A ROCKY MARRIAGE.

14:27.787 --> 14:29.199
SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

14:29.199 --> 14:32.122
ALL RIGHT,
COME ON IN.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.914
LET'S GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.255
THE PLAY THAT
YOU'RE AUDITIONING OR

14:35.255 --> 14:37.877
IS ALL IMPROVISED,
SO FOR YOUR AUDITION,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.669
DO AN IMPROV SCENE
HERE TONIGHT--

14:39.669 --> 14:43.503
A BIG, STRANGE IMPROV SCENE.

14:43.503 --> 14:45.305
YOU'LL BE PLAYING
THE GRANDPARENTS.

14:45.305 --> 14:48.678
OR I COULD BE A WIDE-EYED
MINNESOTA FARM GIRL.

14:48.678 --> 14:50.931
( Minnesota accent )
OH, YEAH, THERE
SURE IS A LOT OF SNOW

14:50.931 --> 14:53.563
HERE IN MINNESOTA
WHERE I'M TALKING TO YOU FROM.

14:54.975 --> 14:57.357
YOU'LL TAKE WHATEVER
PART YOU CAN GET.

14:57.357 --> 14:59.279
WE'RE WORKING IN
A CHILD'S LIVING ROOM,

14:59.279 --> 15:01.151
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.733
BY THE WAY,
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOUSE.

15:03.733 --> 15:06.526
OKAY, THEN.
ANOTHER ACTOR WILL ARRIVE,

15:06.526 --> 15:09.079
PLAYING THE ROLE OF
THE ECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE

15:09.079 --> 15:12.372
WHO WANTS TO SIGN
OUR DOG TO A MODELING CONTRACT.

15:12.372 --> 15:13.954
NO MATTER WHAT
THIS GUY OFFERS YOU,

15:13.954 --> 15:15.375
YOUR ANSWER
SHOULD ALWAYS BE NO.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.997
I'M GONNA GO
FRESHEN UP.

15:16.997 --> 15:19.249
ON THE BUS OVER HERE,
I SAT NEXT TO A LOON

15:19.249 --> 15:21.751
WHO WOULDN'T STOP YELLING!

15:21.751 --> 15:24.544
- YOU WERE SITTING
NEXT TO ME.
- I KNOW.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.389
MAN, I LOVE THAT LOON
ON THE BUS ROUTINE.

15:29.389 --> 15:31.471
I HOPE THEY DO THE ONE
ABOUT THE FOOD BEING TOO HOT,

15:31.471 --> 15:33.433
LIKE THEY DO AT
THE SENIOR CENTER.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.226
"YOU'RE BLOWING SOUP
ALL OVER THE TABLE."

15:36.226 --> 15:38.228
IT'S A CLASSIC.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.063
- ( doorbell rings )
- AND ACTION.

15:45.275 --> 15:47.407
HELLO, MR. FAIRBANKS.
PLEASE COME IN.

15:47.407 --> 15:49.409
WAIT, SIR, I CAN'T...

15:49.409 --> 15:52.282
TOM FAIRBANKS,
ECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE.

15:52.282 --> 15:53.623
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESS
CALLS ME.

15:53.623 --> 15:55.745
I PREFER BILLIONAIRE
OF THE PEOPLE.

15:55.745 --> 15:58.248
EMERSON.
THE GRANDFATHER.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.841
CAROL, FORMER WIDE-EYED
MINNESOTA FARM GIRL...

16:01.841 --> 16:03.503
DONTCHA KNOW.

16:03.503 --> 16:05.965
REIN IT IN, CAROL.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.298
SO WHERE ARE
YOUR PARENTS?

16:08.298 --> 16:10.260
WE HAVE A DEAL
TO DISCUSS

16:10.260 --> 16:11.681
BEFORE I HEAD OFF
TO THE BLACK TIE GALA

16:11.681 --> 16:14.094
FOR MY ANIMAL CHARITY
FUNDRAISER.

16:14.094 --> 16:17.977
I'M PRESENTING
A LIFETIME FARTY AWARD.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.360
DISCUSS THE DEAL
WITH OUR GRANDPARENTS.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.152
THEY'RE OUR GUARDIANS,

16:22.152 --> 16:24.104
SINCE OUR PARENTS SPEND
MOST OF THE YEAR AWAY ON...

16:24.104 --> 16:25.865
- BUSINESS.
- WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS?

16:25.865 --> 16:27.907
- THEY ARE...
- INTERNATIONAL JEWEL THIEVES.

16:27.907 --> 16:31.531
- Both: WHAT?!
- WE'RE SO ASHAMED.

16:31.531 --> 16:33.823
DO YOU REALLY EXPECT
ME TO BELIEVE THAT?

16:33.823 --> 16:35.325
YEAH. DO YOU?

16:35.325 --> 16:37.707
THIS WANTED POSTER
DOESN'T LIE.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.291
WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE
YOUR PARENT' WANTED POSTER

16:41.291 --> 16:43.173
LAYING AROUND?

16:43.173 --> 16:47.127
THEY'RE THE ONLY RECENT
PICTURES WE HAVE OF THEM.

16:47.127 --> 16:49.339
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE
IN CHARGE,

16:49.339 --> 16:51.051
I'M PREPARED
TO OFFER YOU

16:51.051 --> 16:52.842
ONE MILLION DOLLARS
FOR YOUR DOG STAN

16:52.842 --> 16:54.264
TO BE THE FACE OF
MY CHARITY.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.136
NO, I LOVE THAT DOG.

16:56.136 --> 16:58.188
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM,
NOT FOR ANY PRICE.

16:58.188 --> 17:00.060
NEVER, NEVER!

17:00.060 --> 17:02.062
REIN IT IN, GRANDMA.

17:02.062 --> 17:05.605
I'M NOT TAKING YOUR DOG,
I'M JUST HIRING HIM.

17:05.605 --> 17:07.697
BUT I'M PREPARED TO GO
UP TO TWO MILLION.

17:07.697 --> 17:09.949
NO. NOTHING. NEVER. NEVER.

17:09.949 --> 17:11.611
BETTER?

17:13.153 --> 17:15.325
WELL, THERE YOU GO,
MR. FAIRBANKS.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.708
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I'VE NEVER TAKEN NO
FOR AN ANSWER BEFORE.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.210
FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.372
WE LEARN FROM
OUR SETBACKS.
OFF YOU GO.

17:22.372 --> 17:23.963
Bennett: KIDS,
WE'RE HOME.

17:23.963 --> 17:25.715
PERFECT. IF THIS IS
YOUR JEWEL-THIEVING PARENTS,

17:25.715 --> 17:27.757
I'LL MAKE
THE DEAL WITH THEM.

17:27.757 --> 17:30.049
I'M SURE THEY'LL APPRECIATE
A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.842
YOU MUST BE THE PARENTS
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

17:32.842 --> 17:35.385
I'M PREPARED TO OFFER YOU
TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR...

17:35.385 --> 17:37.937
- ( cell phone rings )
- EXCUSE ME.

17:38.978 --> 17:40.440
AGAIN, THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.272
SHOULD'VE GONE OUT TO
THE PATIO FIRST,

17:42.272 --> 17:44.684
BUT MAYBE HE'S GOT
MORE COMING.

17:44.684 --> 17:46.316
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING BACK HERE SO EARLY?

17:46.316 --> 17:48.398
NEVER MIND THAT.
WHO IS THAT MAN,

17:48.398 --> 17:50.690
AND WHAT IS HE OFFERING
TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR?

17:50.690 --> 17:52.402
THAT'S TOM. HE...

17:52.402 --> 17:54.364
A SUPER AGGRESSIVE
MODELING AGENT.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.196
HE WANTS ME TO GIVE UP
MY LIFE, TRAVEL THE WORLD,

17:56.196 --> 17:58.118
- DOING AD CAMPAIGNS.
- WHAT?

17:58.118 --> 18:00.410
- WHAT?
- THAT'S GREAT!

18:01.581 --> 18:04.834
I WAS ONCE IN
THE MODELING GAME.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.466
I WAS A LIVING MANNEQUIN

18:06.466 --> 18:08.798
IN THE WINDOW OF
BUFFUM'S DEPARTMENT STORE.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.303
IT'S AN UMBRELLA,
NOT A KNIFE.

18:14.424 --> 18:16.596
BUT TYLER DOESN'T
WANT TO MODEL.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.719
NO AMOUNT OF MONEY
CAN MAKE HIM MODEL.
PLEASE DON'T MAKE HIM.

18:19.719 --> 18:22.061
ALL THOSE GIRLS
LIKING ME FOR MY LOOKS.

18:22.061 --> 18:23.603
WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

18:24.724 --> 18:27.227
WHATEVER THAT MAN SAYS,
JUST SAY NO.

18:27.227 --> 18:29.189
OKAY.

18:29.189 --> 18:30.900
AND WHO ARE THEY?

18:33.443 --> 18:35.285
THEY ARE...

18:35.285 --> 18:36.656
TOM'S FORMER MODELS.

18:36.656 --> 18:38.198
REALLY?

18:38.198 --> 18:42.582
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY
FORMER MODELS.

18:42.582 --> 18:44.664
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE MODELS.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.878
I KNEW SOMETHING
WAS GOING ON HERE.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.710
IT'S WHY I FAKED
A TUMMY ACHE

18:50.710 --> 18:53.012
AT THE HEALTHY MUFFINS
MEETING TO COME BACK EARLY.

18:53.012 --> 18:55.054
SAVANNAH SNOOPS
IS ON THE CASE.

18:55.054 --> 18:56.466
WHERE'S MY FEDORA?

18:57.927 --> 18:59.389
SO, WHERE WERE WE?

18:59.389 --> 19:02.021
AVERY FILLED US IN
ON WHO YOU ARE,

19:02.021 --> 19:04.354
AND WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN WHAT YOU HAVE TO OFFER.
I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

19:04.354 --> 19:06.436
OH, JUST HEAR ME OUT.

19:06.436 --> 19:10.270
YOU HAVE AN AMAZINGLY
HANDSOME SPECIMEN HERE.

19:10.270 --> 19:14.324
A FURRY LITTLE FELLOW
THAT COULD LIGHT UP THE WORLD.

19:14.324 --> 19:17.327
THAT MAY BE TRUE,
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE WANTS TO BECOME A MODEL.

19:17.327 --> 19:19.199
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
KNOW THAT?

19:19.199 --> 19:21.491
HE DOESN'T HAVE
THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO TELL YOU.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.456
OH, TYLER AND I
BOTH RESENT THAT.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.878
OKAY, I RESENT THAT.

19:28.878 --> 19:30.710
I THINK YOU'D WANT
TO MAKE SOME HONEST MONEY,

19:30.710 --> 19:32.592
GIVEN WHAT YOU DO
FOR A LIVING.

19:32.592 --> 19:36.135
NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
WHO DOES WHAT FOR A LIVING.

19:36.135 --> 19:39.349
I AM VERY WELL RESPECTED
IN MY FIELD.

19:39.349 --> 19:41.971
YES, I CAN SEE HOW MUCH
YOU'RE WANTED.

19:41.971 --> 19:45.475
THIS COULD NOT
BE GOING BETTER.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.397
YOUR OFFER HAS
BEEN REJECTED.

19:47.397 --> 19:49.309
FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

19:49.309 --> 19:51.771
WE LEARN FROM
OUR SETBACKS.
OFF YOU GO.

19:51.771 --> 19:53.363
NOBODY MOVE!

19:53.363 --> 19:55.945
SAVANNAH SNOOPS
HAS SOLVED THE MYSTERY

19:55.945 --> 19:59.489
OF WHAT'S REALLY
GOING ON HERE.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.281
CHLOE, GO TO BED.

20:01.281 --> 20:03.082
EVERYTHING IS
AS IT APPEARS,

20:03.082 --> 20:05.285
AND EVERYONE IS
WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE.

20:05.285 --> 20:06.706
REALLY?

20:06.706 --> 20:09.379
THIS MAN IS WEARING
A TUXEDO,

20:09.379 --> 20:11.090
SO HE'S EITHER
A MAGICIAN,

20:11.090 --> 20:14.504
OR IS GETTING MARRIED TO...
THIS WOMAN!

20:14.504 --> 20:18.798
I TOTALLY SAW
THIS TWIST COMING.

20:18.798 --> 20:22.342
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE TAKIN' MY LADY.

20:22.342 --> 20:26.726
AND THIS MAN IS HERE
BECAUSE HE'S FIGHTING FOR HER.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.937
YES, I AM.

20:27.937 --> 20:29.979
OH, EMERSON.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.352
CAROL.

20:32.352 --> 20:34.904
THERE'S JUST ONE THING
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT.

20:34.904 --> 20:36.276
WHO THE HECK IS...

20:38.278 --> 20:40.450
THIS GUY?

20:40.450 --> 20:42.201
I'M DOUG.

20:43.323 --> 20:45.915
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.
EVERYBODY OUT.

20:45.915 --> 20:48.167
WE HAVEN'T NEGOTIATED YET.

20:48.167 --> 20:51.250
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
MONEY, PRIVATE JETS?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.673
I'LL BRING BACK
THE DEFUNCT BUSINESS

20:53.673 --> 20:55.375
- OF YOUR CHOICE.
- CIRCUIT CITY.

20:55.375 --> 20:58.378
- LINENS AND THINGS.
- MONTGOMERY WARD.

20:58.378 --> 21:01.341
I'VE HEARD STORIES.

21:01.341 --> 21:05.975
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH ALL OF YOU?

21:05.975 --> 21:10.440
AND YOU, HANDSOME,
CHARMING BRITISH GUY.
GET OUTTA HERE.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.272
FINE, FINE. I'VE GOT MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DEAL WITH.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.274
THIS MUTT'S
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.196
DON'T LISTEN
TO HIM, SON.

21:17.196 --> 21:19.068
THANKS, DAD.

21:19.068 --> 21:20.950
COME ON, DOUG,
LET'S ROLL.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.032
VERY FUNNY, SIR.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.206
AND SCENE.

21:34.674 --> 21:37.337
AVERY AND TYLER SUCCEEDED
IN MAKING SURE

21:37.337 --> 21:39.419
I DID NOT BECOME
RICH AND FAMOUS.

21:39.419 --> 21:41.381
( sadly )
YAY.

21:41.381 --> 21:43.302
BUT IT TURNS OUT,

21:43.302 --> 21:46.225
I LOVE MY LIFE
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

21:46.225 --> 21:48.388
ALTHOUGH THERE IS ONE NIGHT
I WISH I COULD FORGET.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.022
ALL RIGHT, STAN, I KNOW
YOU TOOK MY SANDWICH

21:53.022 --> 21:54.354
OFF THE TABLE.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.815
WASN'T ME, I TELL YA.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.437
HEY, I BELIEVE YOU.

21:57.437 --> 21:59.779
BUT MY PARTNER DOESN'T.

21:59.779 --> 22:01.070
OH, PARTNER?

22:01.070 --> 22:05.615
SUSIE HERE...
IS A LOOSE CANNON

22:05.615 --> 22:08.037
WHO DOESN'T
PLAY BY THE RULES.

22:08.037 --> 22:10.620
I'M GONNA GET A JUICE BOX
AND LET YOU TWO TALK.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.622
NO, NO, DON'T LEAVE ME
ALONE WITH HER.

22:12.622 --> 22:13.873
I'LL TALK, I'LL TALK.

22:13.873 --> 22:16.546
WE THOUGHT SO.
