00:07.590 --> 00:11.635
In the far-off land of Ninjago,

00:11.928 --> 00:16.265
winds whispered of an ancient temple,

00:16.433 --> 00:22.229
home to one true legendary warrior.

00:25.608 --> 00:28.652
Dedicating himself to solitude,

00:28.945 --> 00:32.363
he was balanced with the earth.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.451
And he trained tirelessly,

00:36.202 --> 00:39.079
until his moves were super sweet.

00:43.460 --> 00:47.004
He was the one, the only, the...

00:48.965 --> 00:50.841
Astr.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.092
Wait.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.303
Astr? Astra?

00:54.679 --> 00:55.846
Is that even a word?

01:02.645 --> 01:03.687
Stay there.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.692
Starting again? Oh, okay.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.652
In the land of Ninjago,

01:10.820 --> 01:16.033
winds whispered of a temple
with one true legendary warrior.

01:19.662 --> 01:23.999
He lived in solitude,
until he achieved balance with the earth.

01:25.627 --> 01:29.171
And he trained a lot,
so his moves were totally still

01:29.339 --> 01:30.506
super sweet.

01:30.673 --> 01:34.885
He was the one, the only, the...

01:35.053 --> 01:36.595
-Huh?

01:37.305 --> 01:39.473
Now there's a bird and I can't read it.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.019
Mmm-hmm!

01:47.065 --> 01:49.399
In the far-off mystical land...

01:49.567 --> 01:52.027
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow, oh, hey!
All right, winds whispered...

01:52.195 --> 01:53.946
Warrior... Whoa! Solitude... Hey!

01:54.114 --> 01:56.240
He was super sweet and stuff,
and his moves were great,

01:56.407 --> 01:58.242
-and the one and the only and the...

01:58.409 --> 01:59.576
Mmm, surprise, chicken's back.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.869
Get back on the rock.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.334
-In the far... Wait, what?
-Ah!

02:07.502 --> 02:09.586
Oh, the winds have changed.

02:09.753 --> 02:12.756
Now they whisper of a funky chicken.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.553
It's so on.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.104
Oh, jeez.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.439
She bawked at ancient temples.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.822
-Huh?

02:41.911 --> 02:43.745
Ah!

02:44.455 --> 02:46.248
She was balanced with the earth.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.086
No, no, no!

02:51.754 --> 02:53.589
She was the one, the only, the...

02:53.756 --> 02:55.382
-No!

02:56.217 --> 02:57.426
Chicke.

-He was the one...
-Ha-ha!

03:19.866 --> 03:21.742
-The only...
-Ha-ha! Huh?

03:21.910 --> 03:23.285
The Mas-- No.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.703
She knocked them down again.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.298
She was the one...

03:37.634 --> 03:39.384
They keep knocking them off the wall.

03:40.303 --> 03:43.305
Now the building's falling down,
so they should hurry up.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.640
All right, so fine.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.017
He's the one, the only, the...

03:56.319 --> 03:59.112
No!

04:02.742 --> 04:04.660
Master Chicken!

04:09.499 --> 04:11.124
You win.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.378
No, I'm the chicken.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.355
Chicken, you are full of surprises.

04:35.942 --> 04:36.942
Okay.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.112
In a far-off ancient temple,

04:40.280 --> 04:44.741
the winds settled
on two legendary warriors.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.537
-Together they were...

04:50.206 --> 04:53.458
The Masters.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.794
-J. K.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.297
Okay, let's start the movie!

04:59.590 --> 05:01.967
Ooh, yeah, that's awkward.
They just cut right to credits.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.218
I'm sure it was gonna be epic.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.887
But, you know, you got a good story
about a guy fighting a chicken.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.556
I'm happy,
if you guys got what you needed.
