WEBVTT

00:18.208 --> 00:22.122
Professor!

00:50.458 --> 00:51.494
Professor!

01:03.500 --> 01:04.500
Professor!

01:24.208 --> 01:25.351
No, we were at the Miller House,

01:25.375 --> 01:26.832
and now we're at the church.

01:28.792 --> 01:29.792
Yeah.

01:30.792 --> 01:31.792
It's good.

01:33.958 --> 01:34.958
That's nice.

01:38.875 --> 01:39.875
Yeah, I will.

01:43.958 --> 01:45.824
Yeah, later.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.744
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:56.667 --> 01:57.667
Well.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.250
Right.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.667
Great.

02:23.667 --> 02:24.908
First Christian is considered

02:25.000 --> 02:27.458
one of the first modernist
churches in America.

02:29.333 --> 02:30.449
In the United States.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.415
Designed by Eliel Saarinen,

02:42.500 --> 02:44.742
and Christians consider...

03:02.500 --> 03:05.083
Notice how the cross and the doors

03:05.167 --> 03:06.908
and the clock are all off-centre.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.495
This design, Saarinen's design is asy...

03:13.708 --> 03:15.870
Saarinen's design is asymmetrical,

03:15.958 --> 03:17.745
yet still remains balanced.

04:08.375 --> 04:09.616
Here you go.

04:10.708 --> 04:11.708
All right.

04:24.542 --> 04:28.582
- There you are, hey.
- Look, marginalia.

04:28.667 --> 04:29.667
Nice.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.244
Anything good?

04:31.333 --> 04:32.333
Not sure.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.662
Might just be grad student gibberish.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.912
If you do a database dive, let me know.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah, of course.

04:40.292 --> 04:41.292
What's up?

04:42.417 --> 04:43.953
Wanna catch a film tonight?

04:45.500 --> 04:47.366
I can't tonight, sorry.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.663
I'm having dinner with
a friend in Bloomington.

04:50.750 --> 04:51.911
Like a date?

04:53.667 --> 04:55.909
No, no, it's just an old school friend.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.083
Mm-hm, whatever.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.866
Do you have your Master's?

05:03.958 --> 05:05.199
Sadly, yes.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.491
Was it hard to get?

05:08.417 --> 05:10.704
Depends on what you mean by hard.

05:10.792 --> 05:11.792
Why?

05:13.042 --> 05:14.954
I was just talking to Aaron,

05:15.042 --> 05:18.080
and he told me that as a rule they only

05:18.167 --> 05:20.500
give full-time positions to MLS grads.

05:22.042 --> 05:24.204
That's not completely true.

05:24.292 --> 05:25.533
Claire doesn't have one.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.625
She doesn't?

05:28.333 --> 05:30.495
She has a Ph.D. in Lit.

05:30.583 --> 05:31.414
Great.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.492
Yeah, whatever you do, don't get an MLS.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.246
It was recently declared the
worst Master's for a job.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.333
Really?

05:38.292 --> 05:39.874
Yeah.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.790
And yet you have a job.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.241
Well, I'm an exception.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.495
Anyway, you don't want to be a librarian.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.453
I might.

05:50.542 --> 05:51.578
No, you don't.

05:52.542 --> 05:54.659
What about that Deborah Berke?

05:54.750 --> 05:56.616
You'd be crazy to pass that up.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.200
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

06:00.375 --> 06:01.411
Why not?

06:03.583 --> 06:04.583
It's just not.

06:06.042 --> 06:07.283
You wouldn't understand.

06:08.917 --> 06:09.917
Yes, I would.

06:18.833 --> 06:19.949
What?

06:20.042 --> 06:21.042
Nothing.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.033
Come on, let's go see him first.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.208
I still can't
believe how old you are.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.699
You look just the same.

09:56.583 --> 09:57.494
That's not true.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.575
- You do.
- But thank you.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.667
You're sweet.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.204
So how do you like being back in Seoul?

10:06.417 --> 10:07.417
It's okay.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.286
What are you doing there?

10:11.375 --> 10:13.241
I got a job at a publisher,

10:14.167 --> 10:18.616
translating books into
Korean from English.

10:18.708 --> 10:20.018
That sounds interesting.

10:20.042 --> 10:22.750
It is. Not.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.415
It's pretty painful, actually.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.619
I'm on deadline now.

10:26.708 --> 10:27.851
I just got off the phone with them.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.582
They don't expect you to work

10:29.667 --> 10:31.158
while you're here, do they?

10:31.250 --> 10:32.411
I think they do.

10:34.458 --> 10:36.165
You know, it's that Korean thing.

10:37.625 --> 10:41.539
We're so sorry. Family
is the most important thing

10:41.625 --> 10:44.584
but really work is the
most important thing.

10:44.667 --> 10:47.910
So, you better finish that
fucking translation on time.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.248
That can't be true.

10:51.792 --> 10:52.792
We'll see.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.074
I wish you were staying another day.

11:04.167 --> 11:07.490
I know but I was
supposed to be in Chicago

11:07.583 --> 11:09.245
a few days ago with your father.

11:13.750 --> 11:14.831
And I have my work.

11:16.750 --> 11:17.750
My husband.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.742
I know, you've already done so much.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.540
I can't believe this happened.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.458
He was doing fine and then just...

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm sorry.

11:38.125 --> 11:39.125
I just...

11:48.417 --> 11:50.079
I owe him so much.

11:52.333 --> 11:55.371
Your father means everything to me.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.583
Is there anything
else I can get you guys?

12:01.917 --> 12:02.703
No, I think we're ready for the...

12:02.792 --> 12:04.158
Can I get another beer?

12:04.250 --> 12:05.616
Definitely.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.620
Another glass of wine?
- No, thanks.

12:33.792 --> 12:35.768
He didn't even tell me
he was coming on this trip.

12:35.792 --> 12:37.499
Did he tell you that?

12:38.833 --> 12:39.833
No.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.832
That's about right.

12:45.042 --> 12:46.328
Did he mention me at all?

12:50.083 --> 12:51.164
We talked a little.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.536
What did he say?

12:53.875 --> 12:54.911
Jin.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.367
Did he tell you that we
haven't spoken in over a year?

12:57.458 --> 12:59.199
You're all he has.

13:00.458 --> 13:01.559
That has never been the case.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.747
He has his students, his work.

13:04.833 --> 13:05.833
You're his son.

13:07.708 --> 13:09.791
You've been watching
too much Korean drama.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.788
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.036
Can we have the cheque?

13:14.125 --> 13:16.208
Sure, I'll be right back.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.914
I have to leave so early in the morning.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.616
I should go to bed.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.499
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought that up.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.870
The Inn knows about the situation.

13:43.958 --> 13:47.247
You should be able to stay in
his room as long as you need.

13:50.417 --> 13:51.417
Shit.

14:22.750 --> 14:26.073
Hey, are you expecting anyone?

14:28.417 --> 14:30.534
Do you know what
he's doing on Sunday?

14:30.625 --> 14:33.538
No, I'll just drop
you off in the morning

14:33.625 --> 14:34.726
and then take it over to Kenny's.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.992
It'll cost us more if
it breaks down on us.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.244
Ugh, I hate cars.

14:42.458 --> 14:43.458
Me, too.

14:46.208 --> 14:49.906
I think this could use
just a... bit more spice.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.957
You think it does?

14:54.958 --> 14:55.958
Maybe.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.288
I was going for something
a little more subtle.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.117
I don't even know what that means.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.744
You know, less obvious.

15:08.667 --> 15:09.667
Why?

15:12.375 --> 15:14.867
Because sometimes you
can taste the food better

15:14.958 --> 15:16.915
and then there's a better aftertaste.

15:24.417 --> 15:26.283
You crazy.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.368
You are.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.829
This is the
Irwin Conference Centre,

15:34.917 --> 15:37.000
formerly the Irwin Union Bank.

15:37.083 --> 15:41.032
It was completed in 1954 and
designed by Eero Saarinen,

15:41.125 --> 15:44.823
son of Eliel Saarinen, who
designed First Christian Church.

15:44.917 --> 15:47.079
Now like the church, banks in the U.S.

15:47.167 --> 15:50.080
did not look like this in 1954.

15:50.167 --> 15:52.454
They were big, imposing buildings

15:52.542 --> 15:54.454
that had tellers behind bars.

16:06.542 --> 16:09.205
No, no, he's not saying
it's an actual myth.

16:09.292 --> 16:10.809
He's just questioning this common usage

16:10.833 --> 16:12.699
of attention span.

16:12.792 --> 16:15.580
Or really this idea of a
shortening attention span.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.034
So he doesn't think
that this is happening?

16:19.042 --> 16:20.042
You're constantly talking

16:20.125 --> 16:22.037
about how no one can
finish a book anymore.

16:22.125 --> 16:24.833
Yes, that's exactly the point.

16:24.917 --> 16:25.703
I'm bookish.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.249
We're both bookish.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.533
So what he's saying is that
when we talk about attention

16:29.583 --> 16:31.040
we're biassed toward reading.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.625
Like, I had this professor
who used to go on and on

16:34.708 --> 16:36.495
about the idiocy of video games.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.309
He talked about how his
son would play for hours

16:38.333 --> 16:39.119
and that he once tried playing with him,

16:39.208 --> 16:41.916
but found it completely dull
after just a few minutes.

16:43.042 --> 16:45.785
Now, if this was reversed,

16:45.875 --> 16:46.740
if the son was talking about

16:46.833 --> 16:48.119
how his dad would read for hours

16:48.208 --> 16:50.351
and he once tried reading
with him, but found it boring,

16:50.375 --> 16:52.958
after a few minutes, well,
he would accuse the son

16:53.042 --> 16:55.750
of having a short attention span, right?

16:55.833 --> 16:57.226
But why don't we accuse the professor

16:57.250 --> 16:58.476
of having a short attention span?

16:58.500 --> 17:00.143
Because it's not
about attention for him.

17:00.167 --> 17:01.703
It just seems idiotic.

17:01.792 --> 17:04.409
But what if that's exactly
the case for the son?

17:05.375 --> 17:06.559
See, what he's saying is that this boy

17:06.583 --> 17:08.262
is actually able to
give hours of attention

17:08.333 --> 17:10.018
to a video game because
it's interesting to him.

17:10.041 --> 17:12.579
Yeah, but that's because
video games are designed

17:12.666 --> 17:14.454
for people with short attention spans.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.875
Yeah, see, that's
what bookish people say.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.869
But no, what this guy is saying

17:18.958 --> 17:21.916
is it's not a matter of
attention, but of interest.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.726
The professor doesn't have
patience for the video game

17:24.750 --> 17:27.788
because he's not interested
in that kind of experience.

17:27.875 --> 17:28.893
In the same way that the son

17:28.917 --> 17:31.250
might not be interested in books,

17:31.333 --> 17:32.119
and it's not that he doesn't have

17:32.208 --> 17:34.541
the ability to pay
attention, clearly he does.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.117
Like the professor, he's able
to pay attention for hours

17:37.208 --> 17:38.790
if he finds something interesting.

17:38.875 --> 17:42.164
So, down with books,
long live video games?

17:42.250 --> 17:43.741
No, not at all.

17:45.625 --> 17:48.697
What he's offering is a
critique of a critique.

17:48.792 --> 17:52.081
But in its place, he identifies
a different kind of crisis.

17:52.167 --> 17:55.331
Not the crisis of attention,
but the crisis of interest.

17:55.417 --> 17:56.828
See, to talk about attention

17:56.917 --> 17:58.533
is its own kind of distraction.

18:01.375 --> 18:04.447
Kids pay attention to
things that interest them.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.285
The real question is what interests them?

18:07.375 --> 18:08.991
Or us?

18:09.083 --> 18:11.621
Are we losing interest
in things that matter?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.286
Words on a page, for instance.

18:15.958 --> 18:18.075
Yeah, see, maybe that's not so important.

18:20.292 --> 18:21.578
What about everyday life?

18:22.875 --> 18:25.333
Are we losing interest in everyday life?

18:26.500 --> 18:28.207
You got all this from marginalia?

18:29.208 --> 18:30.540
Well, you know, he also filled

18:30.625 --> 18:32.582
all the blank pages in the back.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.241
Casey?

19:38.333 --> 19:39.619
- Emma, hey.
- Hi.

19:39.708 --> 19:41.665
I was hoping to see you.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.082
Yeah, when did you get back?

19:43.167 --> 19:44.499
Oh, just a few days ago.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.414
I'm only here for a week.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.286
Really?

19:46.375 --> 19:47.161
My roommates and I,

19:47.250 --> 19:48.741
we're getting an apartment this year.

19:48.833 --> 19:49.833
It's gonna be so fun.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.867
We're all flying in early to set it up.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.101
Oh, it sounds great.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.411
Yeah, I can't wait.

19:55.917 --> 19:57.158
How was Amsterdam?

19:57.250 --> 19:58.036
Oh my God.

19:58.125 --> 19:58.911
It was the best.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.161
You have to go one day.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.036
Yeah.

20:01.125 --> 20:02.476
No, seriously, you would love it.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.708
The museums, they're incredible.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.875
Guys are so much more interesting.

20:06.958 --> 20:08.449
Yeah.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.125
And school, how is that going?

20:11.208 --> 20:12.494
I love it.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.370
Sophomore year was even better.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.574
LA is amazing.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.329
It already feels like home.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.283
I'll probably end up staying out there.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.741
Yeah.

20:20.833 --> 20:23.075
I mean, I can't
imagine coming back here.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Maybe Chicago.

20:25.875 --> 20:26.615
What about you?

20:26.708 --> 20:27.708
When are you leaving?

20:28.833 --> 20:30.119
To where?

20:30.208 --> 20:30.994
To school.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.120
To anywhere.

20:33.208 --> 20:36.121
Oh, I like Columbus.

20:36.208 --> 20:37.208
C'mon, Casey.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.036
No, I do.

20:38.125 --> 20:41.323
I mean, you of all people,
should be in college.

20:41.417 --> 20:42.999
I'm not in any hurry.

20:43.083 --> 20:43.914
Well, you already missed a year.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.536
You can't keep putting it off.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.601
We need to get some
book carts in the back.

20:48.625 --> 20:51.368
- Right, yeah.
- You should listen to me.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.082
Emma, this is Gabe,

20:55.167 --> 20:55.907
Gabe, Emma.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.707
I went to high school with her.

20:57.792 --> 20:58.578
I was a year ahead,

20:58.667 --> 20:59.908
but we were still really close.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.083
She's like my little sister.

21:02.167 --> 21:03.601
I should
probably get back to work.

21:03.625 --> 21:04.866
It was really nice to see you.

21:04.958 --> 21:06.244
Oh, wait text me, okay?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.199
Let's hang out.
- Yeah, okay.

22:33.583 --> 22:36.997
Actually, I'll take
one, if you don't mind?

22:37.083 --> 22:38.995
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.081
You speak English.

22:48.625 --> 22:51.368
You don't think Asians
can speak English?

22:54.667 --> 22:55.953
Yeah, of course.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.787
No, yeah, I was just I heard you

22:58.875 --> 23:01.538
speaking on the phone and...
- Sorry, I'm being a jerk.

23:01.625 --> 23:02.411
You offered me a cigarette,

23:02.500 --> 23:03.786
and I'm giving you a hard time.

23:06.125 --> 23:07.286
I didn't mean to...

23:08.458 --> 23:09.744
I know what you meant.

23:11.333 --> 23:12.915
Sorry, I'm having a rough day.

23:15.875 --> 23:16.875
Or year.

23:21.625 --> 23:24.038
I saw you at the hospital.

23:25.042 --> 23:26.042
You did?

23:26.875 --> 23:29.242
Yeah, it was early in the morning.

23:31.417 --> 23:32.999
Sorry, I don't remember.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.143
Are you, I don't want this

23:40.167 --> 23:42.830
to sound offensive if you're not,

23:42.917 --> 23:44.874
but are you related to Jae Yong Lee?

23:47.750 --> 23:49.286
I am, I'm his son.

23:49.375 --> 23:50.491
How did you know that?

23:51.542 --> 23:53.408
I was planning to go to his talk.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.286
Ah.

23:54.375 --> 23:55.695
But it was cancelled obviously.

23:56.792 --> 23:57.578
We heard what happened.

23:57.667 --> 23:58.667
Is he okay?

24:00.292 --> 24:03.364
He's stable.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.245
Not enough to put on a plane.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.540
He's still unconscious.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.333
I'm really sorry.

24:16.958 --> 24:17.958
It's okay.

24:23.375 --> 24:24.661
My name's Casey.

24:24.750 --> 24:25.911
It's actually Cassandra,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.457
but everyone calls me Casey.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.667
Jin.

24:29.750 --> 24:30.786
Jim?

24:30.875 --> 24:31.875
Jin.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.125
With an n.

24:35.042 --> 24:36.453
Got it.

24:36.542 --> 24:37.542
Jin.

24:41.542 --> 24:43.204
Are you from here?

24:43.292 --> 24:46.956
Yeah, we moved here when I was four.

24:47.042 --> 24:48.203
Do you like it here?

24:50.542 --> 24:51.542
I do.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.250
How about you?

24:57.167 --> 24:58.167
Not sure yet.

25:02.708 --> 25:03.824
Do you like the Inn?

25:06.333 --> 25:10.623
Yes, it's quite fancy - think
I might break something.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.117
It's not very modernist though, is it?

25:16.250 --> 25:17.250
No.

25:24.792 --> 25:26.249
Is that where your father...

25:28.208 --> 25:29.208
Yeah.

25:30.167 --> 25:32.204
See, it's asymmetrical

25:32.292 --> 25:34.784
but it's also still balanced.

25:40.333 --> 25:42.950
So, you were planning
on going to my father's talk?

25:43.042 --> 25:44.042
Mm-hm.

25:49.292 --> 25:51.659
Are you familiar with his work?

25:51.750 --> 25:55.243
No, but I'm really
interested in architecture.

25:56.167 --> 25:59.660
I've been to almost all the
talks in the past few years.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.867
Yeah, I hear this
town is quite the Mecca.

26:04.292 --> 26:08.457
I'm sure everyone here is
fanatical about architecture, huh?

26:08.542 --> 26:09.542
Are you kidding?

26:10.750 --> 26:13.584
No, most people, they
don't really have any idea.

26:13.667 --> 26:15.203
I mean, they know some things

26:16.083 --> 26:18.871
but they don't really give a shit.

26:18.958 --> 26:20.324
Is that right?

26:20.417 --> 26:22.830
Yeah, you'd be surprised
how little people

26:22.917 --> 26:25.705
know or care about architecture here.

26:25.792 --> 26:26.792
Maybe not.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.661
What do you mean?

26:29.750 --> 26:32.208
I don't know shit about
architecture or care.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.616
I don't believe you.

26:35.708 --> 26:37.290
It's true.

26:37.375 --> 26:38.832
I'm just like everyone here.

26:40.667 --> 26:41.768
You grow up around something,

26:41.792 --> 26:43.158
and it feels like nothing.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.537
Well, I never liked her.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.241
Oh, she's okay.

26:54.292 --> 26:55.078
She's a show-off.

26:55.167 --> 26:56.167
She's not.

26:57.167 --> 26:59.534
Don't start protecting her now.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.833
It's not like everybody can go to Monaco.

27:01.917 --> 27:02.917
Monaco?

27:04.167 --> 27:05.167
Amsterdam.

27:07.333 --> 27:08.333
Whatever.

30:54.500 --> 30:57.572
Oh, sorry, did I wake you up?

30:58.583 --> 31:00.165
No, I was up.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.866
Thought I'd get back in time.

31:03.708 --> 31:05.950
Thanks for taking the trash out.

31:06.042 --> 31:07.829
Doing my part.

31:07.917 --> 31:09.328
You want some eggs?

31:09.417 --> 31:10.157
We're out,

31:10.250 --> 31:11.850
I'm gonna have to go to the store later.

31:14.083 --> 31:15.619
Give me the butter, please?

31:31.625 --> 31:33.708
- Okay, thanks.
- Have a good day.

31:33.792 --> 31:34.832
You, too, see you later.

32:20.875 --> 32:22.787
Hi, are you Christine?

32:22.875 --> 32:23.661
Hello.

32:23.750 --> 32:26.367
Hi, I'm here to turn in my applications.

32:28.125 --> 32:29.241
You have more than one?

32:29.333 --> 32:32.405
Yes, this one is for the
part-time newsroom assistant

32:32.500 --> 32:34.583
and that is for the internship.

32:34.667 --> 32:35.453
Got it.

32:35.542 --> 32:36.542
Thank you.

32:36.583 --> 32:38.791
Do you know when
we might hear something?

32:38.875 --> 32:40.643
It's hard
to say but you're welcome

32:40.667 --> 32:41.809
to call back in a couple of weeks

32:41.833 --> 32:43.369
if you haven't heard from us.

32:44.333 --> 32:45.333
Thank you.

33:04.792 --> 33:05.792
Shit.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.125
Jin!

33:24.375 --> 33:25.240
Jin!

33:25.333 --> 33:26.574
Jin with an n!

33:36.875 --> 33:37.875
Jin.

33:40.625 --> 33:43.083
This is my second favourite building.

33:43.167 --> 33:44.658
Second?

33:44.750 --> 33:46.207
What's your first?

33:46.292 --> 33:48.534
The house I was mentioning.

33:48.625 --> 33:49.934
I'm gonna sign you up for a tour.

33:49.958 --> 33:51.324
It's the only way you can see it.

33:51.417 --> 33:52.203
Hm.

33:52.292 --> 33:54.750
But this is
also by Eero Saarinen

33:54.833 --> 33:56.574
and it sort of resembles a house.

33:58.292 --> 34:00.124
What do you know about it?

34:02.875 --> 34:06.573
This was one of the first
modernist banks in America.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.623
You can imagine at the time that walking

34:08.708 --> 34:12.531
into an all-glass bank was quite unusual.

34:12.625 --> 34:16.414
Radical, really, 'cause during that time

34:16.500 --> 34:19.947
banks were designed to be
imposing, fortress-like,

34:20.042 --> 34:21.658
with tellers behind bars.

34:23.708 --> 34:28.282
The idea here was that you
walk in at street level.

34:28.375 --> 34:29.559
You don't have to climb any stairs.

34:29.583 --> 34:30.664
It's inviting.

34:32.125 --> 34:33.331
Sorry, what?

34:33.417 --> 34:34.703
What are you doing?

34:34.792 --> 34:36.033
What?

34:36.125 --> 34:39.118
Who are you?

34:39.208 --> 34:40.449
Shut up.

34:40.542 --> 34:42.184
I'm just trying to tell
you about this building.

34:42.208 --> 34:44.351
Okay, stop with the
tour guide mode for a second.

34:44.375 --> 34:45.286
I'm not in a mode.

34:45.375 --> 34:46.976
You said this is one
of your favourite buildings.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
- It is.
- Why?

34:51.583 --> 34:53.620
It's one of
the first modernist banks

34:53.708 --> 34:55.309
in the United States.
- No, no, that can't be it.

34:55.333 --> 34:56.809
Do you like this building intellectually

34:56.833 --> 34:58.165
because of all the facts?

35:00.167 --> 35:01.328
No.

35:03.625 --> 35:05.116
I'm also moved by it.

35:05.208 --> 35:07.621
Yes, yes, tell me about that.

35:07.708 --> 35:08.708
What moves you?

35:11.250 --> 35:13.492
I thought
you hated architecture?

35:13.583 --> 35:17.247
I do but I'm
interested in what moves you,

35:17.333 --> 35:18.790
particularly about a building.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.540
But wouldn't you get tired of it?

36:08.625 --> 36:10.332
No, not at all.

36:11.208 --> 36:12.449
And I'd get to interact

36:12.542 --> 36:15.614
with all these interesting
people from all over the world.

36:17.083 --> 36:18.226
The problem
with being a tour guide

36:18.250 --> 36:20.162
is that you stop seeking.

36:21.167 --> 36:23.124
You become some arbiter of tidbit facts

36:23.208 --> 36:25.245
that you start repeating over and over.

36:26.167 --> 36:27.203
You'd hate it.

36:27.292 --> 36:29.033
Take this walkway,

36:29.125 --> 36:30.434
then you'll go through the building

36:30.458 --> 36:32.495
and you'll see signs for the main hospital

36:32.583 --> 36:33.583
on the other side.

36:38.583 --> 36:40.199
I like this building.

36:40.292 --> 36:42.079
- Isn't it great?
- Yeah.

36:43.208 --> 36:45.700
It's a little
rundown, but it's still great.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.161
Can I tell you something?

36:49.250 --> 36:50.250
What?

36:50.292 --> 36:53.251
I know a bit about
Polshek and this building.

36:53.333 --> 36:54.119
You do?

36:54.208 --> 36:56.996
Yeah, he had this idea, Polshek did,

36:57.083 --> 37:00.281
of architecture being
this sort of healing art.

37:00.375 --> 37:02.867
That it had the power to restore

37:02.958 --> 37:05.166
and that architects should be responsible.

37:06.125 --> 37:08.162
- Do you mind if I...
- For the tour?

37:09.292 --> 37:10.828
No.

37:10.917 --> 37:13.500
Anyway, all the details of this building

37:13.583 --> 37:16.371
are mindful of that responsibility,

37:16.458 --> 37:20.031
especially since it was a
structure for mental health.

37:20.125 --> 37:20.956
This building was meant to be

37:21.042 --> 37:24.490
both a literal and metaphoric bridge.

37:26.083 --> 37:29.042
Polshek had the same idea
for the Clinton Library.

37:33.375 --> 37:36.994
Did your dad tell you all this?

37:37.083 --> 37:38.083
No.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.791
I think he was planning on
writing something about Polshek,

37:41.875 --> 37:43.143
but then he found out that Polshek

37:43.167 --> 37:44.908
was writing his own book.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.332
It came out very recently.

37:47.625 --> 37:48.625
And you read it?

37:50.250 --> 37:53.322
Some of it, the
part about this building.

37:54.542 --> 37:57.250
And you don't care about architecture?

37:57.333 --> 37:58.119
I skimmed it,

37:58.208 --> 37:59.888
it was in my father's
room when I got here.

38:01.875 --> 38:06.040
Wait, so you you just recently
read about this building?

38:07.167 --> 38:08.749
Yes, does that matter?

38:10.333 --> 38:12.040
No, I guess not.

38:15.250 --> 38:16.250
You're funny.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.829
Hey.

39:06.917 --> 39:08.579
What are you doing tonight?

39:08.667 --> 39:10.249
I'm hanging out with my mom.

39:11.542 --> 39:12.542
Well, I'm free.

39:13.708 --> 39:14.708
So?

39:15.542 --> 39:17.158
So, let's do something.

39:18.417 --> 39:19.703
Did you not hear me?

39:20.917 --> 39:23.455
Wait, are you getting me
back for the other night?

39:23.542 --> 39:25.204
What?

39:25.292 --> 39:26.999
When I hung out with my friend.

39:28.708 --> 39:29.708
No.

39:30.458 --> 39:32.040
Why would I?

39:32.125 --> 39:34.367
God, I can't believe you
have a Master's degree.

39:34.458 --> 39:35.244
And don't forget it.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.620
Of course, it's the
worst degree you can get.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.994
Better than no degree.

39:41.167 --> 39:42.167
Nice.

39:43.792 --> 39:45.408
Hey, I was just joking.

39:45.500 --> 39:46.500
I know.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.369
C'mon, we were just joking.

39:50.625 --> 39:52.708
You just called my degree the worst.

39:52.792 --> 39:54.533
Yeah, I know, we're good.

39:55.417 --> 39:58.865
We're fine, just leave me alone
and never talk to me again.

40:01.042 --> 40:02.203
Have fun without me.

40:12.250 --> 40:15.789
Hey, should I hang out with
you and your mom tonight?

40:17.375 --> 40:18.206
Seriously?

40:18.292 --> 40:19.292
Yeah.

40:20.125 --> 40:22.788
No, never.

40:25.083 --> 40:25.869
You sure?

40:25.958 --> 40:27.290
- No, goodbye.
- All right.

40:50.292 --> 40:51.292
Mom?

41:30.917 --> 41:33.079
Mom, it's me, call me back.

42:36.667 --> 42:38.726
Hey, I know you're at work,
but I'm just checking in.

42:38.750 --> 42:39.750
Call me, okay?

42:54.708 --> 42:55.494
Hey, sweetie.

42:55.583 --> 42:58.041
I have to get back in a
second, but your mom's fine.

42:58.125 --> 42:58.911
Yeah, I've been trying

42:59.000 --> 43:00.582
to get a hold of her all night.

43:00.667 --> 43:02.374
Her phone's out of charge.

43:02.458 --> 43:03.244
Okay.

43:03.333 --> 43:04.915
Why couldn't she come out?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.866
We have a supervisor with us tonight.

43:06.958 --> 43:07.744
You know, we're not supposed

43:07.833 --> 43:10.041
to have visitors or phone calls or texts.

43:10.125 --> 43:11.582
Sorry, I was worried.

43:11.667 --> 43:12.453
I told her I'd run out.

43:12.542 --> 43:14.249
You know how she is.

43:14.333 --> 43:18.247
Yeah, okay, sorry, I hope
you're not gonna get in trouble.

43:18.333 --> 43:19.119
I'll be fine,

43:19.208 --> 43:20.073
but I should head back up.

43:20.167 --> 43:21.078
Okay, could you just tell her

43:21.167 --> 43:22.703
that I'm gonna pick her up tonight?

43:22.792 --> 43:24.579
No, sweetie, I'll give her a ride.

43:24.667 --> 43:26.158
She wanted me to tell you that.

43:26.250 --> 43:27.832
Okay, she wants you to rest.

43:27.917 --> 43:28.917
I gotta go.

43:35.708 --> 43:36.708
Hey.

43:38.625 --> 43:39.911
What's going on?

43:40.875 --> 43:42.787
I want to show you something.

43:46.333 --> 43:47.333
It's late.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.081
I think I should probably not.

43:49.167 --> 43:50.658
It's not even midnight.

43:52.375 --> 43:53.582
You're such an old man.

43:57.833 --> 43:58.833
C'mon.

44:01.333 --> 44:02.869
It's number three on my list.

44:04.208 --> 44:05.699
Number three, really?

44:08.792 --> 44:13.332
Mostly because it
was the beginning for me.

44:13.417 --> 44:14.417
You know?

44:17.792 --> 44:18.792
This one here?

44:20.417 --> 44:21.417
Yep.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.457
And you didn't know anything about it?

44:24.333 --> 44:25.333
Nothing.

44:27.125 --> 44:30.664
I just saw it from over there.

44:33.792 --> 44:36.205
I'd probably seen it a
thousand times before

44:38.625 --> 44:39.661
but this one night,

44:40.958 --> 44:44.406
I was getting in my car
and I looked up and saw it.

44:53.667 --> 44:56.205
So I jumped back in the
car and drove up here.

44:56.292 --> 45:01.492
Same spot and I just stared
at it for a really long time.

45:06.667 --> 45:07.667
What was it?

45:10.958 --> 45:11.958
Not sure.

45:14.583 --> 45:16.245
It had to have been something.

45:27.417 --> 45:32.458
Well, it was a pretty
miserable time in my life.

45:35.333 --> 45:38.201
When you mentioned the whole healing thing

45:38.292 --> 45:40.454
it sort of made me think of that moment.

45:41.667 --> 45:44.375
I don't know if I
believe that, you know?

45:46.292 --> 45:49.126
That architecture has the power to heal.

45:49.208 --> 45:52.372
I think that's a fantasy that architects

45:52.458 --> 45:53.574
like to tell themselves.

45:53.667 --> 45:54.874
Or people like my father.

45:54.958 --> 45:58.451
People who are invested
in architecture, you know?

46:04.125 --> 46:05.832
I wasn't claiming to be healed.

46:09.875 --> 46:12.834
I'm sorry, I wasn't
trying to be dismissive.

46:18.958 --> 46:22.076
You were telling me it was a
miserable time in your life.

46:22.167 --> 46:24.124
What was going on?

46:24.208 --> 46:26.951
I don't really
want to talk about it.

46:27.042 --> 46:29.079
I just wanted you to see this building.

46:31.208 --> 46:32.208
Please, tell me.

46:36.667 --> 46:39.250
Cassie...
- I just need a cigarette.

46:39.333 --> 46:40.333
Cassandra?

47:00.792 --> 47:02.704
Can you pass me those?

47:05.458 --> 47:06.458
Thank you.

47:14.500 --> 47:19.700
You know, meth is a big
thing here; meth and modernism.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.332
Meth is big everywhere.

47:27.208 --> 47:28.369
Even in North Korea.

47:29.625 --> 47:30.625
Really?

47:32.083 --> 47:33.665
Yeah.

47:33.750 --> 47:34.536
In China.

47:34.625 --> 47:35.625
Everywhere.

47:37.458 --> 47:38.458
Huh.

47:44.917 --> 47:46.374
Were you addicted to meth?

47:48.917 --> 47:49.917
No.

47:55.833 --> 47:56.833
Your mother?

47:58.333 --> 47:59.949
Does she do meth?

48:02.667 --> 48:03.908
What?

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Sorry.

48:06.625 --> 48:07.832
That just sounds funny.

48:09.500 --> 48:10.500
Funny, how?

48:12.083 --> 48:14.075
"Your mother, did she do meth?"

48:15.667 --> 48:16.874
What?

48:16.958 --> 48:18.324
You don't hear it?

48:18.417 --> 48:19.203
Hear what?

48:19.292 --> 48:21.875
"Your mother, did she do meth?"

48:21.958 --> 48:22.958
What?

48:24.792 --> 48:26.704
"Your mother, did she do meth?"

48:26.792 --> 48:27.578
I don't...

48:27.667 --> 48:28.667
Never mind.

48:34.708 --> 48:35.708
So, did she?

48:36.708 --> 48:37.915
Did she what?

48:39.167 --> 48:40.167
You know?

48:42.458 --> 48:45.326
No, no, I don't, what are you asking?

48:48.875 --> 48:50.241
Did your mother do meth?

48:52.292 --> 48:54.830
That was even worse.

49:00.292 --> 49:01.408
So she didn't?

49:04.083 --> 49:05.083
No, she did.

49:08.458 --> 49:10.871
But it was just 'cause this
shit-head guy cheated on her.

49:10.958 --> 49:12.950
That's her real addiction, shit-heads.

49:17.667 --> 49:18.667
Sorry.

49:23.708 --> 49:26.371
Yeah, it got really bad
after the last shit-head.

49:27.792 --> 49:28.792
The worst, really.

49:30.708 --> 49:31.448
When was this?

49:31.542 --> 49:32.542
How old were you?

49:34.208 --> 49:35.289
15, 16.

49:37.750 --> 49:38.750
Sorry.

49:45.917 --> 49:47.059
There were nights that my mom

49:47.083 --> 49:48.699
just wouldn't come home at all.

49:51.083 --> 49:52.540
I had no clue where she was.

49:54.625 --> 49:56.412
That's when I started coming here.

49:58.167 --> 49:59.749
I found it weirdly comforting.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.665
In the middle of all the mess,

50:06.958 --> 50:09.416
in this fucking strip
mall there was this...

50:16.292 --> 50:17.292
This...

50:20.750 --> 50:21.866
I don't know.

50:30.333 --> 50:31.869
I sort of weirdly became obsessed

50:31.958 --> 50:33.540
with this building after that.

50:36.083 --> 50:39.622
That's when I discovered
Deborah Berke, who designed it.

50:39.708 --> 50:41.825
And I learned about
Saarinen, whom she adores,

50:41.917 --> 50:46.366
and just started reading all this stuff.

50:46.458 --> 50:49.530
Suddenly the place I'd lived
my whole life felt different

50:51.208 --> 50:53.450
like I had been
transported somewhere else.

50:57.333 --> 51:02.158
God, Dad would've loved you.

51:02.250 --> 51:04.867
Yeah?

51:04.958 --> 51:07.325
Yeah.

51:07.417 --> 51:08.578
And you don't?

51:17.708 --> 51:18.915
So things got better?

51:22.208 --> 51:23.208
Sort of.

51:25.125 --> 51:26.866
Yeah, I mean slowly.

51:30.542 --> 51:31.542
It was hard.

51:33.417 --> 51:35.249
It was really hard for a long time.

51:37.542 --> 51:38.542
We sort of hit bottom

51:38.625 --> 51:40.867
before my mom was willing to do anything.

51:40.958 --> 51:41.958
It got ugly.

51:43.375 --> 51:44.375
Just.

51:46.875 --> 51:48.491
I'd rather not talk about it.

52:01.208 --> 52:03.951
I met Deborah Berke last year.

52:04.042 --> 52:05.042
Really?

52:05.958 --> 52:08.450
Yeah, the Museum brought her into town

52:08.542 --> 52:10.033
to discuss the Miller House.

52:11.292 --> 52:12.292
She was amazing.

52:13.292 --> 52:14.476
I sort of followed her around,

52:14.500 --> 52:15.411
like a little fan girl

52:15.500 --> 52:17.708
and we actually hung out a few times,

52:17.792 --> 52:21.490
but no big deal.

52:21.583 --> 52:24.291
Yeah, she told me I should
come out to New Haven.

52:25.292 --> 52:26.578
To Yale?

52:26.667 --> 52:27.453
No.

52:27.542 --> 52:28.453
No.

52:28.542 --> 52:31.580
She thought I could get into
the University of New Haven.

52:31.667 --> 52:33.283
She had some connections there.

52:34.917 --> 52:39.332
She also said I could audit
some of her classes at Yale.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.875
Maybe even intern at her firm in New York.

52:43.375 --> 52:44.161
Really?

52:44.250 --> 52:45.530
You want to become an architect?

52:46.667 --> 52:47.667
I don't think so.

52:48.875 --> 52:51.333
I never really thought about
it until she brought it up.

52:52.542 --> 52:53.749
But you'll go, right?

52:55.083 --> 52:58.827
No. We don't have the resources

52:58.917 --> 53:03.491
and I really think I
should stay with my mom.

53:03.583 --> 53:05.074
She's doing really well.

53:05.167 --> 53:06.167
We're happy.

53:09.583 --> 53:11.245
I just think I should stay here.

59:19.333 --> 59:22.292
So he built this 22 years later?

59:24.875 --> 59:26.286
Was the father still alive?

59:27.583 --> 59:28.699
Uh, no.

59:30.417 --> 59:32.454
Er, I don't know.

59:33.458 --> 59:38.658
Eliel died in 19... when was it?

59:40.125 --> 59:41.912
Let me check.

59:42.000 --> 59:42.740
No, don't!

59:42.833 --> 59:43.619
Don't, give me a second.

59:43.708 --> 59:44.494
No, stop!

59:44.583 --> 59:45.583
Seriously.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.324
Eliel died in 19...

59:51.667 --> 59:54.660
1950.

59:54.750 --> 59:57.083
Yeah, so he was he was definitely dead.

59:57.167 --> 59:58.624
Yes.

59:58.708 --> 59:59.494
1950.

59:59.583 --> 01:00:00.949
The tour guide nails it.

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:02.954
I don't even know why
you wasted your data.

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:05.204
- Waste my data?
- Never mind.

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:09.955
Smart phone, dumb human.

01:00:10.042 --> 01:00:11.184
So, you never use your phone?

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.619
For phone calls.

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:13.869
Right.

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:16.166
I have a dumb
phone, no internet.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.912
That's not even possible.

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:22.083
What?

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:27.118
I search plenty
of things on the computer.

01:00:30.458 --> 01:00:32.825
Does this make you feel
better than everybody else?

01:00:32.917 --> 01:00:33.917
Hardly.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:52.037
You'd love Eleanor, by the way.

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:55.823
She was probably a lot like
you when she was younger.

01:00:55.917 --> 01:00:56.782
Yeah?

01:00:56.875 --> 01:00:57.875
How so?

01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:01.743
You know an architecture nerd.

01:01:03.792 --> 01:01:05.454
Oh, is that what I am?

01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:08.333
Yes.

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.375
Really?

01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:14.667
Without a doubt.

01:01:15.917 --> 01:01:16.917
Hm.

01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:19.625
Go on.

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:24.243
Well, Eleanor was telling me

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:27.576
about my dad's latest research.

01:01:27.667 --> 01:01:31.490
He was writing something
on the Saarinen churches.

01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:33.244
Really?

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:34.869
Like what?

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:36.119
I'm not sure exactly.

01:01:36.208 --> 01:01:40.532
Something about the paradox
of modernism and religion.

01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:45.533
That's interesting.

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:48.125
I suppose.

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:50.375
Are you religious?

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.250
No.

01:01:54.417 --> 01:01:57.000
I think religions are like monarchies.

01:01:58.042 --> 01:01:59.518
There might be a good king here and there

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:03.411
but the system is problematic.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.786
Too easy to exploit.

01:02:07.042 --> 01:02:08.578
So you're anti-monarchy?

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:11.583
Yes.

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:13.333
Isn't everyone?

01:02:15.125 --> 01:02:16.241
You'd be surprised.

01:02:19.542 --> 01:02:20.282
What about your dad?

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.707
Does he believe in anything?

01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:27.328
He believes in modernism.

01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:31.033
Modernism with a soul.

01:02:32.167 --> 01:02:33.167
I like that.

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:36.949
I don't know what it means,

01:02:37.042 --> 01:02:39.409
but he used to say it all the time.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.618
Something about an
alternative possibility.

01:02:52.292 --> 01:02:54.033
What are you doing?

01:02:54.125 --> 01:02:56.492
Just checking to
see if this might be it.

01:02:58.042 --> 01:02:59.042
It's not.

01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.125
What?

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:02.994
Take a look at this.

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:04.449
What do you think it is?

01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:05.542
Those lines?

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:12.828
I don't know.

01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:14.328
They could be anything.

01:03:14.417 --> 01:03:17.160
But it sort of looks
like a tower, right?

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:20.042
Yeah, I guess.

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:22.333
It's not this.

01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:26.333
What's this mean?

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:31.575
It's just fragments

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:35.786
that says much ado about nothing.

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:37.707
Nothing underlined.

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:44.245
What's over here?

01:03:44.333 --> 01:03:45.995
With the exclamation point?

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:48.533
That just says "yes".

01:03:49.667 --> 01:03:54.617
Effort plus cost to see

01:03:55.917 --> 01:04:01.117
what is invisible and always visible.

01:04:03.333 --> 01:04:06.326
No, omni-visible.

01:04:07.292 --> 01:04:10.035
No, always visible.

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:11.125
Always.

01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:14.958
Wow.

01:04:16.042 --> 01:04:17.082
I should ask Gabe at work.

01:04:17.125 --> 01:04:19.037
He's really into these kind of riddles.

01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:21.333
Yes, yes, what the fuck?

01:04:24.167 --> 01:04:27.331
My father was always
trying to be so profound.

01:04:27.417 --> 01:04:28.851
Why wouldn't he just
the write the name down

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:30.366
or draw a better picture?

01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:33.809
Well, I didn't think he thought someone

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:34.664
was ever gonna read this.

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.958
He probably knew exactly what he meant.

01:04:37.042 --> 01:04:38.749
It's still fucking annoying.

01:04:42.458 --> 01:04:44.040
Can I ask you something?

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:45.491
Maybe.

01:04:45.583 --> 01:04:47.950
Why aren't you at the hospital?

01:04:48.042 --> 01:04:50.625
Nothing's changed, you know?

01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:52.074
If I were there right now,

01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:56.250
it would be just like
the last time I saw him.

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.369
He'd just be lying there.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.245
Why should I just stare at him all day?

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:02.786
You could talk to him.

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:07.617
This isn't the movies,
nothing's gonna happen.

01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:10.661
You know, there's been research.

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.286
I don't want to talk to him.

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:15.786
We never talked.

01:05:17.542 --> 01:05:18.828
He was never interested.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.741
Why should I bother him now?

01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:34.905
Do you think he's got
a chance to recover?

01:05:36.042 --> 01:05:39.206
Even if it's just enough
to go back to Seoul?

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:46.375
God.

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:51.125
I hope not.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:54.417
What?

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:04.656
The truth is, if I were in Korea

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.833
I'd be expected to be there when he died

01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:13.161
and to express sorrow in the
most dramatic fashion.

01:06:16.167 --> 01:06:17.601
There's this belief
that if you're not there

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:19.036
when a family member dies

01:06:21.167 --> 01:06:23.409
and not adequately grieving,

01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:28.197
your spirit will roam aimlessly

01:06:28.292 --> 01:06:29.453
and become a kaekkwi.

01:06:31.542 --> 01:06:32.542
A ghost.

01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:42.247
Of course, my dad didn't
believe in that shit

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:45.367
but, still, it would be expected of me.

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:49.582
Do you believe in it?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
No.

01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:57.155
But if you were in
Korea, you'd go along with it.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.250
Probably.

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:04.208
So, what?

01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:07.908
You don't want him to get better?

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:15.333
Maybe not.

01:07:18.792 --> 01:07:19.792
Hm.

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:26.042
Oh.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:27.917
That's so sad.

01:07:36.292 --> 01:07:37.828
I think your mom was right.

01:07:39.792 --> 01:07:40.976
Are you just trying to get back at me

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.116
for talking about your dad?

01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:44.951
No, I've been thinking
about it since you told me.

01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:46.082
What she says makes sense.

01:07:46.167 --> 01:07:47.203
Stop.

01:07:47.292 --> 01:07:48.453
You have no idea.

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:49.578
You're bright.

01:07:49.667 --> 01:07:51.499
You can do a lot.

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:53.870
You should go to New Haven,
take her up on her offer.

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:54.958
What offer?

01:07:56.042 --> 01:07:56.828
What offer?

01:07:56.917 --> 01:07:59.079
She was being nice, and
I blew it up in my head.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.457
And I don't even want to go.

01:08:01.542 --> 01:08:02.542
I can't.

01:08:03.625 --> 01:08:05.018
You said your mom wants you to go.

01:08:05.042 --> 01:08:06.078
Yeah.

01:08:06.167 --> 01:08:07.328
She just feels guilty

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.285
and she doesn't know what it would mean.

01:08:10.375 --> 01:08:12.116
Give your mom some credit, huh?

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.143
I can't believe you're lecturing me.

01:08:18.167 --> 01:08:20.250
I'm not lecturing you.

01:08:20.332 --> 01:08:21.665
I'm not lecturing you!

01:08:24.042 --> 01:08:25.999
You quit grad school, right?

01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:29.122
That is different.

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:32.750
That is completely different and...

01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:36.328
The reason I'm telling you this

01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:38.249
and the reason your
mother is telling you this

01:08:38.332 --> 01:08:40.416
is because you're smart and talented.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.832
You could do a lot better!

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.917
Than what?

01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:46.790
Taking care of my mom?

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:50.018
You obviously don't get that, do you?

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.078
Because you're here
hoping that your dad dies

01:08:52.167 --> 01:08:53.999
so you don't have to mourn for him.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.707
I should go.

01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:49.643
It is one of the most significant
attempts at

01:10:49.667 --> 01:10:52.990
modern romantic
architecture in the world.

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:55.791
Table that mimics the one outside.

01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:57.992
- Where's the fountain?
- Inside.

01:10:58.083 --> 01:10:59.415
In the table.

01:11:00.917 --> 01:11:02.226
A statue of Henry Moore's

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:03.411
Draped Reclining Woman

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.457
used to reside on this plinth up here

01:11:05.542 --> 01:11:06.726
but there was an auction one day

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.286
and Oprah bought it.

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:11.243
And over here to the right,
we have a second century...

01:11:44.292 --> 01:11:46.750
Can you do the translation
work in his room?

01:11:46.833 --> 01:11:49.792
I just think you should be
there whenever possible.

01:11:49.875 --> 01:11:51.116
I'm there a lot.

01:11:51.208 --> 01:11:53.916
It makes a
difference, Jin, it does.

01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:07.393
I think you'd really like her.

01:12:07.417 --> 01:12:09.500
She sounds great.

01:12:09.583 --> 01:12:11.165
She's a mini-version of you.

01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:15.493
I mean, she's not smaller, she's younger.

01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:18.374
Oh, I get it.

01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:21.082
How old did you say she was?

01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:25.368
Um, I don't know, 19, 20.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
You like her?

01:12:30.208 --> 01:12:31.244
I think she's...

01:12:34.042 --> 01:12:35.374
Well, what do you mean?

01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:36.458
What do you mean?

01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:40.200
Do you like her, like her?

01:12:41.833 --> 01:12:42.869
How old are you?

01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:48.824
You do, don't you?

01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:52.416
You need to pull back on that wine.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.581
You love her.

01:12:56.042 --> 01:12:57.954
First of all, she's way too young.

01:13:00.625 --> 01:13:02.582
Ah, wait, weren't you 18

01:13:03.667 --> 01:13:05.454
when you declared your love to me?

01:13:09.083 --> 01:13:10.083
Or was it 17?

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:13.164
Shut up.

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:14.991
I never did that.

01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:16.574
Ah, you did.

01:13:16.667 --> 01:13:17.667
I didn't.

01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:23.825
Maybe you didn't use the word love but...

01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:28.745
Aw, you were so sweet.

01:13:32.792 --> 01:13:35.125
God, I was hoping that never happened.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.208
It did.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:44.911
I just, I hoped it
was in my imagination.

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:51.245
"Eleanor, I want you to
know that I think you're..."

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.536
What did you say?

01:14:01.917 --> 01:14:02.917
What was it?

01:14:06.292 --> 01:14:08.659
I was admittedly a little naive.

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:09.911
No, you were sweet.

01:14:11.208 --> 01:14:13.040
I always thought you were adorable.

01:14:15.208 --> 01:14:16.208
Just young.

01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:19.411
Very serious.

01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:28.332
I was, what?

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.500
I was 20.

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.250
Yes.

01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:44.787
I did have an agonising crush on you.

01:14:47.167 --> 01:14:50.285
God, you were like...

01:14:58.083 --> 01:15:00.200
You look just like your dad right now.

01:15:21.792 --> 01:15:23.124
No.

01:15:23.208 --> 01:15:23.994
Please.

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:25.083
No.

01:15:25.792 --> 01:15:30.833
- Eleanor.
- No, you have to go.

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:32.328
I can't do this.

01:15:33.958 --> 01:15:35.540
You have to leave.

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:22.245
More glass.

01:16:24.292 --> 01:16:25.408
More glass.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.207
Transparency.

01:16:31.458 --> 01:16:32.458
Light.

01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:37.162
This is number five on my list.

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:38.536
- Woo-hoo!
- Shh.

01:16:42.458 --> 01:16:43.323
Look at the dummy!

01:16:43.417 --> 01:16:44.874
- Ssh!
- Who are you calling?

01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:47.041
Just give me a second.

01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:00.707
Hi, Vanessa, it's Casey.

01:17:00.792 --> 01:17:02.704
Sorry to bother you, but I'm just trying

01:17:02.792 --> 01:17:04.499
to get a hold of my mom again.

01:17:04.583 --> 01:17:06.223
I want her to know that I will definitely

01:17:06.292 --> 01:17:07.203
pick her up in the morning.

01:17:07.292 --> 01:17:08.783
Can you tell her that?

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:09.875
Thanks, bye.

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:41.616
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:45.158
You okay?

01:17:55.792 --> 01:17:56.792
Oh, hi.

01:17:56.833 --> 01:18:00.247
Sorry, I was just gonna
leave another message.

01:18:07.667 --> 01:18:08.532
Yeah.

01:18:08.625 --> 01:18:11.038
Yes, I forgot that she told me that.

01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:12.707
That's why I was calling back.

01:18:17.667 --> 01:18:19.829
Okay, got it, so you'll drive her.

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:23.582
Hey, did my mom's phone die again?

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:27.998
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.699
Can I talk to her for a second?

01:18:36.167 --> 01:18:37.167
I see.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.583
Okay, well, tell her I said hey.

01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:45.375
Okay, thanks.

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:50.582
Everything okay?

01:18:54.708 --> 01:18:55.869
Casey, what's the matter?

01:19:01.625 --> 01:19:04.697
Do you wanna go to a party?

01:19:04.792 --> 01:19:06.374
What?

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:08.018
My friend Emma invited me to a party.

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:09.249
We could still make it.

01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:14.163
No, I don't want to go to a party.

01:19:15.833 --> 01:19:16.833
Yeah, you do.

01:19:28.958 --> 01:19:29.958
Agh!

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.833
What are you doing?

01:21:21.417 --> 01:21:22.658
Oh, nothing.

01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:28.833
Did I miss the party?

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:29.917
What party?

01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:32.875
Didn't you say we were going to a party?

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:35.411
Oh, right.

01:21:37.083 --> 01:21:40.906
No, I wanted to come here instead.

01:21:42.833 --> 01:21:43.914
Where are we?

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:46.375
Nowhere!

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:50.866
What is this?

01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:55.874
This is where I went to school.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:01.250
That's brutal.

01:22:14.875 --> 01:22:15.661
Want to check it out?

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.036
I know how to get inside.

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:19.667
You do?

01:22:21.458 --> 01:22:22.198
- Ssh.
- What?

01:22:22.292 --> 01:22:26.832
I thought I heard something.

01:23:10.667 --> 01:23:12.018
Why aren't you answering your phone?

01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:13.453
We need to get to the hospital.

01:23:13.542 --> 01:23:14.578
What's going on?

01:23:14.667 --> 01:23:15.453
I don't know.

01:23:15.542 --> 01:23:16.822
There's been some complications.

01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:18.537
We need to go.

01:23:18.625 --> 01:23:20.332
Let me get my phone.
Hurry up!

01:23:27.208 --> 01:23:28.540
What's going on?

01:23:30.375 --> 01:23:34.745
Oh, hey I need to go to the hospital.

01:23:36.583 --> 01:23:38.666
Is everything okay?

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:43.950
I don't know.

01:24:22.667 --> 01:24:24.283
Cassandra?

01:24:24.375 --> 01:24:25.240
Oh, hi.

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:26.869
What are you doing here?

01:24:26.958 --> 01:24:28.415
Uh, I was just visiting someone.

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:29.536
Here?

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:30.866
Yeah, we have a guest

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:32.574
that's giving a talk at the library.

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:34.909
Oh, I heard
that you're working there.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.081
I am, I love it.

01:24:36.167 --> 01:24:38.033
So how's your mom doing?

01:24:38.125 --> 01:24:38.865
She's great.

01:24:38.958 --> 01:24:39.958
Good, good.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.184
I heard she's doing much better.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:41.994
Yeah.

01:24:42.083 --> 01:24:43.851
And she's still
working at the factory?

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:44.661
Yeah, she is.

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:46.992
It's part-time, she's
almost at 30 hours now.

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:49.268
She's doing some night cleaning,
too, but it's temporary.

01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:50.393
Oh, yeah, that's,

01:24:50.417 --> 01:24:53.034
I'm so happy to hear that, Cassandra.

01:24:53.125 --> 01:24:55.242
And when will you be graduating?

01:24:55.333 --> 01:24:56.574
I graduated last year.

01:24:58.042 --> 01:24:58.828
Oh, that's good.

01:24:58.917 --> 01:25:00.909
Are you going to...
- I really better get going.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:01.740
Sorry.

01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:03.393
Okay, well, tell your mom, hi.

01:25:03.417 --> 01:25:04.203
Yeah, I will.

01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:09.538
Nice to see you.
- Bye.

01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:51.787
Where have you been?

01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:08.533
Cassandra, what's wrong?

01:26:17.042 --> 01:26:18.658
What am I gonna do?

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:19.911
What do you mean?

01:26:23.208 --> 01:26:25.621
How long do I
stay here and just wait?

01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:28.495
As long as it takes.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.866
So I just wait until he dies?

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:36.539
Or recovers.

01:26:38.167 --> 01:26:39.453
He's not gonna recover.

01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:49.492
Whatever happens, you need to wait.

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:53.583
I do?

01:26:58.292 --> 01:27:00.705
If he dies, you don't
want him to die alone.

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:02.958
- I don't?
- You don't.

01:27:08.792 --> 01:27:10.328
It doesn't seem fair.

01:27:11.583 --> 01:27:13.290
He never paused his life for me.

01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:21.495
I know this is hard.

01:27:22.583 --> 01:27:23.699
I'm so sorry.

01:28:03.125 --> 01:28:04.787
So along with the music room,

01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:06.241
the front parlour was designed

01:28:06.333 --> 01:28:09.451
for receiving and entertaining guests.

01:28:09.542 --> 01:28:12.865
It was also meant to showcase
the family's art collection.

01:28:12.958 --> 01:28:14.574
The Millers were more serious collectors

01:28:14.667 --> 01:28:16.408
than any generation before them.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:19.913
In fact, the art collection
that was stored here

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.242
and at the Miller House sold in auction

01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:24.199
through Christie's in 2008.

01:28:24.292 --> 01:28:27.012
It was the largest collection of impressionistic...

01:28:34.667 --> 01:28:35.453
Like you said,

01:28:35.542 --> 01:28:37.222
it's better than what you thought, though.

01:28:39.958 --> 01:28:42.166
But it's a pattern.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.708
This guy's from
work, maybe he's the one?

01:28:47.875 --> 01:28:49.207
I doubt that.

01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:51.241
Haven't met him.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:55.537
I'm tired of meeting new guys.

01:28:57.792 --> 01:28:58.999
I'm just tired.

01:29:05.917 --> 01:29:07.499
Then accept Eleanor's offer.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.037
My mom would be lost without me.

01:29:22.125 --> 01:29:23.125
Yeah.

01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:26.375
Maybe.

01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:39.583
Will you pass me one of those?

01:29:39.667 --> 01:29:40.667
Yeah.

01:30:10.667 --> 01:30:11.874
You want one?

01:30:19.583 --> 01:30:21.666
Where does this building
rank on your list?

01:30:23.625 --> 01:30:24.625
This?

01:30:25.417 --> 01:30:26.417
Mm-hm.

01:30:30.583 --> 01:30:35.783
I don't know probably late teens, 20's.

01:30:36.458 --> 01:30:37.458
Hm.

01:30:41.042 --> 01:30:43.159
I think this is what
my dad's referring to.

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:51.035
That?

01:30:51.125 --> 01:30:52.125
Yes.

01:30:53.875 --> 01:30:54.875
Hm.

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.583
If it's not, I'm gonna say that it is.

01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:07.167
Walk along the storage
walk and let you take a look.

01:31:08.167 --> 01:31:12.332
This table here, was
designed by Alexander Gerard.

01:31:13.625 --> 01:31:15.207
The design of it is the same design

01:31:15.292 --> 01:31:17.784
that he put on the curtains
in the children's area.

01:31:17.875 --> 01:31:18.661
Hm.

01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:19.536
It's pretty, huh?

01:31:19.625 --> 01:31:20.786
Yeah.

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:23.709
And he also picked out
all the pillow textiles.

01:31:23.792 --> 01:31:26.250
- Hm.
- I love this area.

01:31:26.333 --> 01:31:28.074
It's bright.

01:31:28.167 --> 01:31:30.284
And there's a
fountain that shoots up

01:31:30.375 --> 01:31:31.684
in the middle of the dining table

01:31:31.708 --> 01:31:34.701
and it sort of mimics the
fountain out in the backyard.

01:31:34.792 --> 01:31:36.033
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:54.917
Jin?

01:32:01.792 --> 01:32:02.792
Jin?

01:32:51.542 --> 01:32:53.329
I can't
believe you're leaving.

01:32:57.167 --> 01:32:58.999
Me, neither.

01:32:59.083 --> 01:33:00.745
It'll be good for you.

01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:04.370
That's what people keep saying.

01:33:04.458 --> 01:33:05.494
It's true.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.992
I should probably go.

01:33:19.292 --> 01:33:20.499
Wanna know something?

01:33:23.458 --> 01:33:24.458
What?

01:33:26.042 --> 01:33:27.533
I don't really smoke.

01:33:28.958 --> 01:33:29.958
Shut up.

01:33:35.458 --> 01:33:36.458
It's true.

01:33:38.042 --> 01:33:40.034
I just liked hanging out here with you.

01:33:44.542 --> 01:33:45.542
Yeah.

01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:53.242
I should probably stop.

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:09.499
I better go, my mom's waiting for me.

01:34:11.167 --> 01:34:12.167
Last dinner.

01:34:13.083 --> 01:34:14.083
Yeah.

01:34:16.875 --> 01:34:18.036
Want me to join you?

01:35:18.875 --> 01:35:23.495
I think that was
your best dinner yet, missy.

01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:26.619
So subtle.

01:35:30.208 --> 01:35:31.665
That wasn't subtle.

01:35:34.958 --> 01:35:36.915
But it was good, though, thank you.

01:35:41.708 --> 01:35:43.995
What am I gonna do without your dinners?

01:35:46.625 --> 01:35:47.741
Hm?

01:35:47.833 --> 01:35:49.199
Use the microwave.

01:35:50.417 --> 01:35:53.080
Oh, that's exactly what I'll be doing.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.037
I made you a list of
recipes, don't forget.

01:36:00.125 --> 01:36:01.125
Use them, okay?

01:36:13.792 --> 01:36:16.125
I really wish that we'd
done more things together.

01:36:16.208 --> 01:36:17.208
You know?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.492
Like taken a trip together or something.

01:36:27.792 --> 01:36:30.830
I really can't believe we never did that.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.207
Not even once.

01:36:37.042 --> 01:36:38.042
Mom.

01:36:40.833 --> 01:36:41.833
You shouldn't...

01:36:44.792 --> 01:36:45.792
We were...

01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:47.750
It was...

01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:54.039
Oh God, it must have been
so hard growing up with me.

01:36:56.875 --> 01:36:58.286
I'm so sorry, Casey.

01:36:58.375 --> 01:37:01.038
Mom, no, it wasn't.

01:37:06.958 --> 01:37:08.244
I love being with you.

01:37:15.667 --> 01:37:19.490
I don't even know why
I'm leaving, honestly.

01:37:24.833 --> 01:37:27.792
I just want to stay here with you.

01:37:39.042 --> 01:37:40.042
Mom.

01:37:44.833 --> 01:37:45.833
Mom.

01:37:58.375 --> 01:37:59.375
Mom?

01:38:02.292 --> 01:38:04.534
How's the apartment?

01:38:04.625 --> 01:38:05.661
It's not the Inn.

01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:08.537
Well, nothing's the Inn.

01:38:08.625 --> 01:38:09.625
Is it bearable?

01:38:11.083 --> 01:38:12.540
No complaints.

01:38:12.625 --> 01:38:13.411
It's actually nice.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:14.500
I like the neighbourhood.

01:38:14.583 --> 01:38:16.119
It's a week-to-week?

01:38:16.208 --> 01:38:17.208
Month-to-month.

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:20.033
That's still good.

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:10.833
Thanks - for everything.

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:20.247
Thank you for being here.

01:39:23.292 --> 01:39:24.954
I hope my mom's gonna be okay.

01:39:26.333 --> 01:39:27.949
She's gonna be all right.

01:39:31.458 --> 01:39:32.744
She wants this for you.

01:39:34.375 --> 01:39:36.116
Casey, she's so proud of you.

01:39:41.667 --> 01:39:43.454
I feel bad leaving you, too.

01:39:43.542 --> 01:39:45.329
You gotta keep me posted, okay?

01:39:46.833 --> 01:39:47.833
I will.

01:39:48.958 --> 01:39:50.745
But you need to stop feeling bad.

01:39:51.833 --> 01:39:54.371
Yeah, so do you.

01:39:56.958 --> 01:39:58.165
Maybe.

01:40:02.167 --> 01:40:04.159
Think I'm gonna quit smoking.

01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:05.115
Yeah?

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:06.208
Yeah.

01:40:07.458 --> 01:40:08.323
It's probably a good idea.

01:40:08.417 --> 01:40:09.417
She's not a fan.

01:40:21.792 --> 01:40:23.624
You better get going.

01:40:25.833 --> 01:40:26.833
I know.
