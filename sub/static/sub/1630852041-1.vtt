WEBVTT

01:17.468 --> 01:18.904
about the new film
I'm working on

01:18.948 --> 01:21.777
called Zeros and Ones,
by Abel Ferrara.

01:21.820 --> 01:25.694
I've been a fan of Abel
since I first fell in love
with the movies.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.914
He's a completely unique
and extraordinary filmmaker.

01:28.958 --> 01:33.223
He's got voice with the camera.
He has depth with his actors.

01:33.267 --> 01:37.880
The work that he's done
most recently with Willem Dafoe
has been wildly inspiring to me,

01:37.923 --> 01:40.274
so I was very grateful
to get the script.

01:40.317 --> 01:44.756
Especially considering
that the script
speaks to this moment.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.151
Not in any obvious,
uh, didactic way,

01:48.195 --> 01:52.155
but you can feel
that this is Abel's hit

01:52.199 --> 01:55.898
on what we've all been going
through for the last year or so.

01:55.941 --> 02:00.163
Uh, it's a beautiful script.
I play a military man.

02:00.207 --> 02:03.427
You're not exactly sure whether
I'm a good guy or a bad guy,

02:03.471 --> 02:06.517
and I also play my own brother,
who's a revolutionary.

02:06.561 --> 02:09.912
And so, that's very dynamic
for me to get to play

02:09.955 --> 02:13.394
these two characters
that are representing
contrasting viewpoints.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.657
I think we're gonna be able
to do something really special.

02:15.700 --> 02:19.269
Uh, I consider the most
important aspect of my job,

02:19.313 --> 02:21.837
who I choose to work with,
that's what actors do.

02:21.880 --> 02:26.058
You know,
we champion filmmakers,
uh, we champion voices.

02:26.102 --> 02:29.584
And I'm excited for the world
to see Abel's response

02:29.627 --> 02:32.935
to-to this wild year
we've been living through.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.415
I hope you enjoy it.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.479
[metal clanking]

03:09.972 --> 03:13.280
[machine whirring]

04:19.781 --> 04:23.001

[exhales]

08:58.581 --> 09:01.062
[phone ringing]

09:25.129 --> 09:27.479
Yo, you good?

09:28.742 --> 09:30.178
Still here.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.847
All right, here,
let me pull it up.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.939
Hey, let me-- let me
work with this some more.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.353
[sighs]

11:53.843 --> 11:56.063
[bus engine revving]

12:27.529 --> 12:29.357
[sighs] What's it say?

12:29.400 --> 12:30.793
You're still alive.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.229
You trust it?

12:32.273 --> 12:33.796
[soft chuckle]
Come on.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.190
[receding footsteps]

12:43.458 --> 12:45.373
[car doors close]

12:45.416 --> 12:47.767
[car engine revving]

13:23.498 --> 13:25.805
That's the news to the world.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.636
[intense snare drum beat]

13:33.943 --> 13:36.554
[man, voice-over] It is
to religion that we call you.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.862
The religion of sincerity.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.604
The best manners,
righteousness,

13:42.647 --> 13:45.563
mercy, honor, purity, piety.

13:48.305 --> 13:52.309
It is the religion
of showing kindness to others.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.659
Establishing justice
between them,

13:55.791 --> 13:58.011
granting them the rights,

13:58.054 --> 14:01.362
and defending the oppressed
and the persecuted.

14:05.714 --> 14:10.414
We call you to be a people
of principles,
honor, and purity.

14:10.458 --> 14:15.855
That you may be
freed from the deceptive lies,
that you are a great nation.

14:21.208 --> 14:25.690
Do you now know why we fight
and why we shall be victorious?

14:56.286 --> 14:59.159
Hey, shoot it
so they believe it.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.579
[JJ, voice-over]
Symbol of Christianity...

15:33.671 --> 15:35.760
death to the infidels...

15:38.502 --> 15:40.548
[intense snare drum beat]

15:45.379 --> 15:47.511
The 3,000-year war...

16:04.398 --> 16:06.966
Jesus was just another soldier,

16:08.010 --> 16:10.012
another war casualty...

16:16.279 --> 16:17.846
but on whose side?

16:58.408 --> 16:59.844
[doorbell buzzes]

17:11.291 --> 17:12.640
Hey.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.339
Come up the back.

17:21.692 --> 17:24.826
[footsteps approaching]

18:00.557 --> 18:02.081
[knocks on door]

[child crying in distance]

19:11.367 --> 19:13.630
[sighs deeply]

19:18.809 --> 19:21.682
- [child sniffling]
- [Valeria clicking tongue]

19:26.295 --> 19:29.255
[child crying]

19:48.099 --> 19:49.362
His father?

19:54.671 --> 19:56.195
Your brother...

19:57.500 --> 19:59.023
is still in prison.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.594
Well, at least he's alive.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.901
[Valeria] For now.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.773
Are you sure?

20:11.166 --> 20:12.733
[Valeria] You tell me.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.738
[scoffs]

20:26.747 --> 20:28.183
Is that your rabbit?

20:30.316 --> 20:31.665
Does he have a name?

20:37.845 --> 20:39.368
What are you dreamin' about?

20:41.631 --> 20:42.850
Fish?

20:46.462 --> 20:47.681
Porcupines?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.081
[whispers]
Goodnight.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.622
I only have tea.

21:15.665 --> 21:16.710
That's fine.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.279
[tea pouring]

21:38.427 --> 21:41.212
Have you figured out
what you're doing in my country?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.436
I'm workin' on it.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.138
Lots of honey?

21:54.182 --> 21:55.792
- [JJ] Mm-hm.
- Right.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.536
What's with you
Americans and honey?

22:24.081 --> 22:26.867
You don't care
if he ever gets out.

22:28.521 --> 22:31.045
[sighs]

22:31.088 --> 22:34.004
He won't last
ten minutes on the street,

22:34.048 --> 22:35.658
knowin' what he knows.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.447
How do they know what he knows?

22:42.622 --> 22:44.058
You told them?

22:45.407 --> 22:49.759
[JJ breathes deeply]

23:01.510 --> 23:04.339
[footsteps]

23:13.174 --> 23:15.785
[phone ringing]

23:20.703 --> 23:22.226
[woman over phone]
I heard you're back.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.885
Show him.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.421
And they're both negative.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.652
[bus engine revving]

24:27.117 --> 24:28.554
[loud knock on door]

25:37.448 --> 25:39.668
[exhales]

26:13.180 --> 26:14.573

[mouths]

26:38.684 --> 26:40.294
[snapping fingers]

27:06.320 --> 27:08.365
He's addicted to the screens.

28:13.343 --> 28:19.480
In another time and place,
it could be castor oil,

28:19.523 --> 28:22.309
and I'd call you partigiano.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.445
Made in Swiss...

28:30.143 --> 28:32.623
made popular in San Francisco,

28:32.667 --> 28:36.976
and perfected recently by a chef
not far from here.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.589
It's quicker and more effective.

28:42.546 --> 28:43.504
[Justin] Ah, shit.

28:43.547 --> 28:45.288
No-- you don't...

29:00.956 --> 29:03.002
[gasping for air]

29:03.045 --> 29:05.134
[Luciano] Shh... Shh...

29:07.963 --> 29:09.138
Where?

29:12.838 --> 29:15.318
Where... and when?

29:15.841 --> 29:16.929
Okay?

29:18.887 --> 29:21.760
It takes more than guns
to kill a man.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.807
You think I'm your enemy?

29:25.851 --> 29:28.331
Yeah, is that what you think?

29:31.726 --> 29:36.818
Your fear made me,
and now, here I am.

29:38.602 --> 29:43.999
I am your enemy, but your enemy
won't be gone when you kill me.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.220
You can't kill me.

29:48.874 --> 29:53.226
Try it, watch what happens.

29:53.269 --> 29:57.534
I'll be right back
after the sound and the fury
is finished.

29:57.578 --> 30:00.015
Where, and when?

30:01.321 --> 30:02.626
Come on.

30:02.670 --> 30:07.414
[Justin]
This machine kills fascists.

30:07.457 --> 30:11.200
This machine is my voice.
It's the human voice.

30:11.244 --> 30:14.856
My heart is the drummer--
Okay, all right.

30:14.900 --> 30:18.207
You wanna know-- you wanna know
where the door is, eh?

30:18.251 --> 30:19.905
[Lucian] Where, and when?

30:19.948 --> 30:21.471
[Justin sniffs, laughs]

30:21.515 --> 30:22.995
No, wait, wait.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.213
I'll tell you--

30:24.257 --> 30:25.780
I'll tell you--
I'll tell you--

30:25.824 --> 30:26.955
I'll tell you where the--
where the door--

30:26.999 --> 30:29.262
I'll meet you--
I'll meet you there.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.527
And I'm not afraid to die.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.745
And you?

30:36.008 --> 30:37.270
You're dead already.

30:38.924 --> 30:42.275
I would light myself on fire!

30:42.318 --> 30:47.454
How come no one
is lighting themselves
on fire, eh?!

30:47.497 --> 30:53.460
How come no one is
lighting themselves
on fire anymore?!

30:53.503 --> 30:56.115
This country
was conceived in liberty,

30:56.158 --> 31:01.816
dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.863
This is a battleground.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.953
The world is watching
what happens here,

31:07.996 --> 31:12.653
and it is up to us,
the living...

31:12.696 --> 31:15.395
to finish the work of the dead

31:15.438 --> 31:18.137
so they will
not have died in vain

31:18.180 --> 31:20.922
and that a government
of the people, for the people,

31:20.966 --> 31:24.099
by the people, shall not perish
from this earth!

31:24.143 --> 31:28.408
Hail Caesar!
Hail Augustus Caesar
'cause he-he got it, he got it.

31:28.451 --> 31:30.453
And you-you, are you American?
You're American, right?

31:30.497 --> 31:32.629
I can't see him,
behind his mask!

31:32.673 --> 31:33.848
Are you American?

31:45.033 --> 31:47.383
You know the song!

31:48.515 --> 31:49.820
Are you American?

32:02.746 --> 32:07.229
[whispering]
It's the law of nature,
nature's God.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.579
We hold these truths
to be self-evident

32:09.623 --> 32:11.886
that all men are created equal
and that they are endowed

32:11.930 --> 32:14.193
with certain unalienable rights:

32:14.236 --> 32:17.065
Life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.849
Do you know who said that?

32:18.893 --> 32:20.677
Who knows who said it,
raise their hand.

32:22.679 --> 32:28.990
It wasn't one man,
yet you wanna kill one man.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.384
All right, all right, all right.

32:31.427 --> 32:32.951
You wanna know
where the door is.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.171
Didn't you find it?

32:36.215 --> 32:39.522
When you were
rifling through my bag?

32:39.566 --> 32:42.090
Writing my suicide note?

32:42.134 --> 32:46.051
[stuttering] Where did you
come up with that idea, huh?

32:46.094 --> 32:48.009
You learn that
from your scoutmaster now?

32:48.053 --> 32:52.231
Are you guys Boy Scouts?
Do you swear to be
faithful and true, huh?

32:52.274 --> 32:57.932
Huh? Don't you even know
that your strippers are Marxist?

32:59.586 --> 33:03.720
Your shoemakers are my soldiers?

33:03.764 --> 33:08.464
That your cameraman
is my brother, huh?

33:08.508 --> 33:12.947
Nobody living's ever going to
stop me from walking
the freedom highway.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.907
Nobody living's gonna
make me turn back

33:16.951 --> 33:22.391
'cause this land
was made for you and me.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.874
You don't know
how to work with wood.

33:27.831 --> 33:31.879
You don't love it, huh?

33:31.922 --> 33:35.796
- You hate trees,
that's why you hate me--
- Okay.

33:35.839 --> 33:38.451
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no!

33:38.494 --> 33:40.931
Ah, fuck! Oh!

33:40.975 --> 33:43.325
Oh, please, Lord,
grant me the courage

33:43.369 --> 33:45.849
to love those who hate me
so that we may change the world.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.765
- Oh, please, Lord,
grant me the courage...
- [men chanting in Arabic]

33:48.809 --> 33:51.507
...to love those who hate me
so that we may change the world.

33:51.551 --> 33:55.076
Grant me the courage to love
those who hate me
so that we may change the world.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.035
[chanting continues]

35:32.260 --> 35:33.914
[JJ sighs]

35:36.351 --> 35:38.397
So when is this gonna happen?

35:40.964 --> 35:43.532
It has been happening
for a thousand years.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.407
[JJ] Is he here now?

35:51.279 --> 35:52.976
He was born here.

36:00.375 --> 36:05.598
Do you remember how you felt
when you first
put on that uniform?

36:11.081 --> 36:12.518
I felt useful.

36:16.739 --> 36:20.439
Did your brother
ever wear a uniform?

36:25.357 --> 36:28.229
No.
[sniffles]

36:33.408 --> 36:35.367
[intense snare drum beat]

37:14.319 --> 37:15.842
We had a deal.

37:18.932 --> 37:21.195
Oh, my American friend.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.503
Always talking about a deal.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.593
Hm.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.728
You still wearing your vest?

37:34.469 --> 37:36.428
At all times, Captain.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.871
So how are things with you?

37:47.047 --> 37:49.441
You tell me.

37:49.484 --> 37:53.096
Stop playing games,
imperialist.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.795
You worship it.

37:55.838 --> 37:58.754
It is time to live it.

38:25.085 --> 38:26.173
Oh.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.526
Where is he?

38:33.702 --> 38:35.182
In training.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.540
[grunting]

38:57.160 --> 38:59.206
[windows shatters]
[door explodes]

38:59.249 --> 39:02.165
- Don't move!
- [speaking in foreign language]

39:02.209 --> 39:05.604
Don't move!
I said, don't fucking move!

39:05.647 --> 39:07.649
[grunts]

43:24.514 --> 43:26.691
[JJ] Looks like the boss.

43:26.734 --> 43:28.431

43:29.432 --> 43:30.869
His boss.

Your brother's dead.

44:58.391 --> 45:00.698
We're negotiatin' for his body.

45:18.324 --> 45:20.718
[JJ] This is really
how he wants to die?

45:24.243 --> 45:28.551
I paid dearly for the words
you put into my mouth.

45:28.595 --> 45:31.641
You fooled me
that I can see the hereafter.

47:18.313 --> 47:20.576
[woman] The time has come.

47:23.971 --> 47:27.670
It was told to me
from the Holy Father...

47:29.803 --> 47:31.761
in his prayer.

47:33.502 --> 47:39.030
He wants you
to initiate the response.

47:40.596 --> 47:43.773
Ask help from no one.

48:02.488 --> 48:04.490
They will all betray you.

48:05.970 --> 48:08.668
They will deny
you even existed.

48:13.020 --> 48:15.066
Do you know
what happened to my brother?

48:16.241 --> 48:18.243

[JJ] The world
is the hiding place of God.

You know who said that?
Jesus.

To understand
what's outside of you,

1:06:12.533 --> 1:06:14.971
you must use what's in you.

1:09:50.055 --> 1:09:51.970
Your brother was an anarchist.

1:09:53.928 --> 1:09:56.757
Your brother was a communist.

1:09:57.976 --> 1:10:00.196

- We gotta get out of here.
- Where?

1:10:20.477 --> 1:10:22.043

1:16:41.466 --> 1:16:43.511
[no audible dialogue]

1:18:26.179 --> 1:18:29.226
Well, the movie's over.

1:18:30.531 --> 1:18:35.449
Uh, when I first
spoke to you, um,

1:18:35.493 --> 1:18:37.538
I was really
just recording a video

1:18:37.582 --> 1:18:40.150
to help raise money
to make the movie.

1:18:40.193 --> 1:18:44.067
And now, uh,
we've made the film!

1:18:44.110 --> 1:18:48.332
And I just watched it,
and you just watched it.

1:19:06.785 --> 1:19:09.962
When Abel gave me the script
and, uh--

1:19:10.006 --> 1:19:16.447
script is a really, uh,
not accurate term
for what he sent.

1:19:18.405 --> 1:19:20.494
I really didn't understand
a word of it...

1:19:20.538 --> 1:19:22.148
Yeah.

1:19:22.192 --> 1:19:24.934
But I really liked it.
[soft chuckle]

1:19:24.977 --> 1:19:29.808
Uh, I did, but I didn't know
what was happening.

1:19:29.852 --> 1:19:33.420
I felt like somebody
was up to something,

1:19:33.464 --> 1:19:35.509
and that I wanted to be
a part of it,

1:19:35.553 --> 1:19:37.990
but I didn't know
what he was trying to say.

1:19:42.299 --> 1:19:45.781
And now,
after watching the film,

1:19:45.824 --> 1:19:51.787
I think what I began to feel
while we're making it is true.

1:19:51.830 --> 1:19:53.614
Which is that you're--

1:19:53.658 --> 1:20:00.143
You can have kind of two
opposing outlooks on the world

1:20:00.186 --> 1:20:02.841
and that they're both accurate.

1:20:02.885 --> 1:20:05.409
You kind of can
align your shoulders one way

1:20:05.452 --> 1:20:08.455
in which you realize you wake up
in the morning and you think,

1:20:09.543 --> 1:20:12.633
"Oh, shit, I'm gonna die.

1:20:12.677 --> 1:20:16.028
I mean, this is real.
I'm gonna die."

1:20:16.072 --> 1:20:19.162
And the world is run

1:20:19.205 --> 1:20:24.863
by corrupt, greedy individuals

1:20:24.907 --> 1:20:29.302
and there's great tragedy
and disease

1:20:29.346 --> 1:20:32.479
and the planet is eroding.

1:20:32.523 --> 1:20:36.788
And not only am I gonna die,
everybody I know is gonna die.

1:20:36.832 --> 1:20:40.487
And brothers lie to each other,
and people hurt each other.

1:20:40.531 --> 1:20:46.624
And you just-- you just
don't know if you can go on,
or what the point of it all is.

1:20:46.667 --> 1:20:51.977
And then almost
with-with the same ease,

1:20:52.021 --> 1:20:56.199
you can align your shoulders
a different direction and go,

1:20:56.242 --> 1:21:02.074
"I was born! Why was I born?
I'm so glad I was born.

1:21:02.118 --> 1:21:07.253
Everybody was born,
and the sun comes up
and there're flowers.

1:21:07.297 --> 1:21:10.735
And guess what,
a lot of people
are really nice!"

1:21:10.778 --> 1:21:13.912
And there's a kind of
pervasive kindness and healing

1:21:13.956 --> 1:21:19.570
that runs through the world
as it spins away.

1:21:19.613 --> 1:21:22.834
And there's all this
tremendous beauty!

1:21:22.878 --> 1:21:26.577
Every child is a miracle

1:21:26.620 --> 1:21:29.972
and I wonder why I was born,
you know.

1:21:30.015 --> 1:21:31.582
What I'm doing.

1:21:31.625 --> 1:21:36.413
Both those outlooks
are a hundred percent true.

1:21:48.425 --> 1:21:51.602
This is part of the movie,
by the way.

1:21:51.645 --> 1:21:53.038
And now it's over.
