announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.809 --> 00:12.480
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.815
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.848 --> 00:16.784
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.817 --> 00:18.252
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:18.286 --> 00:20.388
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.191
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.425
- NO, NO, MARIA.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.459
NO, YOU CAN'T.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.627
YOU CAN'T PULL THAT CRAP.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.196
NO, YOU HAD ZARA
ALL SUMMER LONG.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.597
RIGHT, I FLEW OUT THERE.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.732
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FLY HER
OUT HERE FOR THANKSGIVING.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.167
YEAH, MY MOTHER'S EXPECTING US.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.169
MY SISTER'S FLYING UP
FROM MIAMI.

00:35.203 --> 00:38.339
NO, LOOK, THIS ISN'T
UP FOR DISCUSSION, ALL RIGHT?

00:38.372 --> 00:39.573
NO--WELL, YEAH, WHO'S YELLING?

00:39.607 --> 00:41.242
I'M NOT YELLING.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.377
NO, YOU DON'T HANG--
DON'T HANG UP ON ME.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.412
MARIA?

00:45.446 --> 00:47.348
DAMN IT.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.350
- WHOA.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.353
HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.622
- NOTHING.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.657
- OKAY, TAKE A BREATH.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.660
- HOW ABOUT YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO?

01:06.700 --> 01:08.702
- DON'T SAY IT.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.238
- SAY WHAT?

01:12.140 --> 01:14.108
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAND?

01:14.142 --> 01:16.076
- AH, NOTHING; IT'S FINE.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.782
- THAT WORK-RELATED?

01:21.815 --> 01:23.584
- YEAH, SOME GEEK HACKED

01:23.617 --> 01:26.420
CELEBRITY NUDE SELFIES
FROM THE CLOUD

01:26.454 --> 01:28.222
AND POSTED THEM REDCHANIT.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.490
- AND THAT'S SVU BECAUSE...

01:29.523 --> 01:31.792
- SOME OF THE CELEBS
IN THE PICS ARE UNDERAGE.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.327
THAT MAKES IT CHILD PORN.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.628
- OKAY, WRAP IT UP, FIN.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.630
FIND ANYTHING,
HAVE TARU TRACE IT.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.766
- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
NAKED PICTURES OF YOURSELF

01:38.799 --> 01:40.134
ON THE INTERNET,

01:40.168 --> 01:41.502
DON'T TAKE NAKED PICTURES
OF YOURSELF.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.704
- RIGHT, AND IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO GET ASSAULTED,

01:43.737 --> 01:45.105
DON'T WEAR A SHORT SKIRT?

01:47.708 --> 01:49.577
- WAIT, HOLD UP.
WHO'S THAT?

01:49.610 --> 01:51.279
- WHAT?
- NO, GO BACK.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.280
THERE.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.681
- THAT'S A.J. MARTIN.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.816
- FROM THE SPORTS WRAP
PREGAME SHOW?

01:55.849 --> 01:58.452
- NOW, BUT BEFORE THAT
HE'S A HEISMAN TROPHY WINNER

01:58.486 --> 02:01.155
AND AN EIGHT-TIME PRO BOWLER.
THAT'S--

02:01.189 --> 02:03.257
THAT'S HIS BABY MAMA
PAULA BRYANT.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.358
- BUT HOW
IS THIS GUY MIXED IN

02:04.392 --> 02:05.526
WITH THOSE CELEBRITY NUDES?

02:05.559 --> 02:06.594
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.829
REDCHANIT'S LIKE A FAILED STATE.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.165
THEY'LL POST ANYTHING NOW.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.469
WHOA.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.837
- HEY, GUYS.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.606
WHAT IS THIS,
A CELEBRITY NUDE TASK FORCE?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.441
- IT MAY BE SOMETHING MORE.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.312
- A.J. MARTIN?

02:24.345 --> 02:25.413
WHEN WAS THIS?

02:25.446 --> 02:26.947
- I MEAN, FROM THE WAY
THEY'RE DRESSED,

02:26.980 --> 02:28.416
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE BLACK AND WHITE GALA

02:28.449 --> 02:30.384
AT THE MET SIX WEEKS AGO.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.553
TONS OF PRESS COVERAGE.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.290
- I DON'T REMEMBER
HEARING ANYTHING

02:36.324 --> 02:38.392
ABOUT A.J. MARTIN BEING
PICKED UP ON A DOMESTIC.

02:38.426 --> 02:39.627
- WELL, THEY MUST HAVE
PICKED HIM UP,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.929
BECAUSE A PATROLMAN SHOWS UP.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.197
- THE GUY'S A SPORTS HERO.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.398
YOU KNOW HOW THIS GOES.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.833
- WELL, I KNOW HOW
IT USED TO GO.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.869
SHE'S SO OUT OF IT,
SHE CAN HARDLY WALK.

02:48.902 --> 02:52.373
FIND OUT IF THERE'S ANY VIDEO
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BETWEEN.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.707
- YEAH, I DON'T SEE IT
POSTED ANYWHERE.

02:53.741 --> 02:54.875
WE CAN CONTACT THE GARAGE.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.244
- YOU KNOW, CALL THE LOCAL
PRECINCT.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.445
FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.446
I'LL CALL THE CHIEF.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.880
- YOU WANT US TO INVESTIGATE?

02:59.913 --> 03:02.283
- AFTER RAY RICE AND THE OTHERS,

03:02.316 --> 03:03.717
IF IT LOOKS
LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,

03:03.751 --> 03:07.187
WE FOLLOW UP--
BEFORE THIS BECOMES THE NEWS.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.260
[dramatic music]

03:56.870 --> 03:57.271
.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.205
- YOU NEVER GOT INTO IT
AFTER A FEW TOO MANY?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.741
HOW IS THIS SVU?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.577
- WELL...THAT'S HOW.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.779
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.682
- MUST BE SLOW DOWNTOWN.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.484
WELL, IT WAS A COUPLE'S THING.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.553
MY OFFICER ARRESTED BOTH
AT THE SCENE.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.355
- YEAH, WE SAW THAT,
BUT SHE WAS WOOZY,

04:14.388 --> 04:17.458
SHE'S MISSING A SHOE,
SHE LOOKED ROUGHED UP.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.861
- MS. BRYANT DECLINED
MEDICAL ATTENTION.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.062
HE WAS POLITE.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.797
SHE WAS CONTRITE.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.666
- SO THEIR INTERVIEWS
WERE CONSISTENT?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.535
- IT WAS MORE OF A DISCUSSION.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.937
- BUT THEY WERE
SPOKEN TO SEPARATELY?

04:29.970 --> 04:32.306
- I DIDN'T SEE THE NEED.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.443
LOOK, WE GOT A LOT OF SWELLS
UP HERE,

04:35.476 --> 04:37.478
AND SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.980
- OH...

04:40.013 --> 04:41.382
I GET IT.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.885
- HEY...A.J. IS A LEGEND.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.888
HIS LADY SAID SHE GOT JEALOUS
AND SHE MADE A SCENE.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.090
SOME LOW-LIFE LEAKED THAT VIDEO
TO REDCHANIT.

04:50.123 --> 04:50.924
NOW YOU GUYS WANT
TO COME IN HERE

04:50.958 --> 04:53.093
AND PLAY MONDAY MORNING
QUARTERBACK?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.628
- WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

04:54.662 --> 04:56.096
WHY NO CHARGES WERE FILED.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.065
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE
IT WAS ADJOURNED

04:58.098 --> 05:00.534
CONTEMPLATING DISMISSAL.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.336
SO YOU GOT A PROBLEM,

05:02.370 --> 05:04.304
YOU CAN TAKE THAT UP
WITH THE D.A.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.776
- OUT OF CONTEXT,
THIS VIDEO IS DISTURBING,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.878
BUT IT DOESN'T CONTRADICT
THE POLICE REPORT

05:10.911 --> 05:11.845
SENT TO THE A.D.A.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.046
- WHO WAS THIS A.D.A.?

05:13.080 --> 05:14.882
- DANIELLE DICARLO--
GREEN, BUT GOOD.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.584
TAKING HER FIRST VACATION
IN THREE YEARS.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.586
TO SAY THAT SHE IS DEDICATED
IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.887
- WELL, TO SAY THAT SHE
THREW THE BOOK AT HIM

05:19.920 --> 05:20.888
IS AN OVERSTATEMENT.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.023
- THE PRECINCT COPS SAID
IT WAS A DRUNKEN SPAT.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.426
DICARLO DROPPED THE CHARGES
AGAINST PAULA,

05:25.459 --> 05:27.728
OFFERED A.J. ADJOURNMENT
IN CONTEMPLATION OF DISMISSAL.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.630
HE DOES COMMUNITY SERVICE,
DIDN'T RE-OFFEND--

05:29.663 --> 05:31.832
- IN SIX MONTHS,
IT ALL GETS DROPPED.

05:31.865 --> 05:32.966
- LOOK, THAT'S THE DEAL
THAT I GIVE

05:33.000 --> 05:34.001
WHEN THE VICTIM REFUSES
TO COOPERATE.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.036
OR ARE YOU SAYING
BECAUSE THEY'RE CELEBRITIES,

05:36.069 --> 05:38.105
WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM
ANTI-PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.206
- I'M SAYING THAT YOUR A.D.A.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.675
SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
THE ARRESTING OFFICER'S WORD.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.377
- I TAKE YOUR WORD ALL THE TIME.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.379
ANYWAY, THIS IS MOOT.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.114
THE DEAL WAS OFFERED;
THE LAWYER SAID NO.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.683
- THEY TURNED DOWN
A "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" CARD?

05:49.717 --> 05:51.919
WHY?
- IT'S THE SMART MOVE.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.087
A.J. CALLED THE A.D.A.'S BLUFF.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.857
HE JUST ASSUMED THAT HE'D
GET AWAY WITH IT REGARDLESS.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.026
WHAT, HE'S PROBABLY
WORRIED ABOUT P.R.,

05:59.059 --> 06:00.661
HE'S TRYING TO AVOID
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.796
SO, GREAT, HE GETS AWAY
WITH EVERYTHING.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.998
- EVERYTHING?
LOOK, THERE'S NOT A LOT HERE.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.534
ANY FOOTAGE FROM THE STAIRWELL?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.636
- AMARO AND ROLLINS
ARE TRACKING IT DOWN.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.103
- AND WHEN THEY FIND IT,

06:10.137 --> 06:11.905
WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA SEE,

06:11.939 --> 06:14.041
THE SAME THING WE'VE SEEN BEFORE
FROM THESE GUYS.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.476
HE KNOCKED HER OUT.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.810
- WHY NOT JUST CONVICT HIM NOW?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.579
- HE DRAGGED HER
UNCONSCIOUS BODY

06:18.612 --> 06:21.549
OUT OF THAT STAIRWELL
WITH NO CONCERN FOR HER,

06:21.582 --> 06:23.183
AND THEN SHE SAYS
SHE SLIPPED AND FELL?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.518
COME ON.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.318
- IN CERTAIN WAYS,
I DON'T DISAGREE.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.620
- I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
SAY THAT.

06:26.654 --> 06:27.821
- SINCE HE DIDN'T
TAKE THE OFFER,

06:27.855 --> 06:28.822
THE CASE IS STILL OPEN.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.024
FIND THE VIDEO,
OR GET HER TO CHANGE HER STORY.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.893
WE'LL SEE WHERE WE ARE.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.565
- WE COOPERATED WITH THE POLICE.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.133
THE D.A. OFFERED
A CONDITIONAL DISCHARGE.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.602
MY LEGAL TEAM'S ON IT.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.537
- THAT WAS BEFORE
THE VIDEO CAME TO LIGHT.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.805
- YEAH, WELL, I MEAN,

06:44.838 --> 06:46.507
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD
BE FOLLOWING UP ON.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.041
I MEAN, WHO LEAKED THIS?

06:48.075 --> 06:51.645
- WE HAVE DETECTIVES
WORKING ON THAT.

06:51.679 --> 06:52.846
- GOOD THROW, SHORTY.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.081
- I'M GONNA BE A PLAYER,
JUST LIKE MY DAD.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.516
WHO ARE YOU?

06:55.549 --> 06:57.184
- ANTWAN JARROD,
IT'S TIME TO GO TO YOUR ROOM.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.619
THERE'S GROWN FOLKS TALKING.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.087
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- JUNIOR!

07:00.120 --> 07:01.655
- YES, SIR.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.124
- GO AHEAD TO YOUR ROOM, BOY.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.159
AIN'T NOBODY PLAYING WITH YOU.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.632
HE WANTS TO BE
LIKE HIS OLD MAN.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.166
WITH AN ARM LIKE THAT, THOUGH,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.135
HE'S A NATURAL QUARTERBACK.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.571
- CARRYING ON
THE FATHER-AND-SON DYNASTY.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.772
- TRUE DAT.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.040
JUNIOR'S COACH SAYS--

07:20.073 --> 07:21.108
- A.J.'S ONLY 8,

07:21.141 --> 07:23.577
BUT HE PLAYS
WITH THE 10-YEAR-OLDS.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.118
- UH...

07:31.151 --> 07:33.153
WOULD YOU MIND SHOWING ME
THE RESTROOM, PLEASE?

07:33.186 --> 07:36.056
- YEAH, SURE,
IT'S RIGHT DOWN HERE.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.858
- THANKS.
- HAVE A SEAT.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.098
- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT, RIGHT?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.501
- YEAH.
YOU GOT TO DO YOUR JOB.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.936
I RESPECT THAT.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.138
- ALL THE ATHLETES
IN THE PRESS RIGHT NOW--

07:51.171 --> 07:54.207
MY SERGEANT JUST WANTS
TO DOUBLE-CHECK EVERYTHING.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.176
YOU MIND WALKING ME THROUGH IT?

07:56.209 --> 07:59.112
- IT'S LIKE I TOLD
THE BOYS THAT NIGHT.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.082
HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK,
HAD SOME WORDS.

08:02.115 --> 08:02.916
THAT'S ALL.

08:02.950 --> 08:06.987
- THOSE WORDS DIDN'T
TURN INTO DEEDS?

08:07.020 --> 08:09.590
- HEY, I LOVE MY GIRL.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.958
BUT EVEN SHE WOULD TELL YOU

08:10.991 --> 08:14.027
THAT SHE GOES OFF THE RAILS
WHEN SHE'S HAD A FEW.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.229
ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO
WAS MAKE SURE

08:16.263 --> 08:19.499
THAT EVERYTHING STAYED
WITHIN THE HASH MARKS.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.871
- IT'S...RIGHT HERE.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.938
- GREAT.
PAULA, IS THERE ANYTHING

08:24.972 --> 08:27.841
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT NIGHT,

08:27.875 --> 08:30.143
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

08:30.177 --> 08:32.179
- NO, I'D BEEN DRINKING.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.214
I WENT AFTER A.J.,
AND I TRIPPED.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.616
END OF STORY.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.151
- BUT YOU WERE GOING UPSTAIRS.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.287
- EXCUSE ME, SERGEANT.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.022
THIS IS MY HOUSE,

08:42.055 --> 08:43.957
AND YOU'RE HERE
WITH MY PERMISSION.

08:43.991 --> 08:47.127
ANYTHING YOU SAY TO PAULA,
YOU CAN SAY TO BOTH OF US.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.773
- DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE GARAGE FOOTAGE.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.675
- NO, IT'S FROM THE GALA,
AND IT'S ALL WE GOT,

09:01.709 --> 09:03.176
'CAUSE THE GARAGE IS CLAIMING

09:03.210 --> 09:06.046
THAT THEY ERASE THEIR SECURITY
CACHE EVERY SEVEN DAYS.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.216
- SO HOW DID THE FIRST VIDEO
END UP ON REDCHANIT

09:09.249 --> 09:11.919
SIX WEEKS AFTER THE EVENT?
THEY'RE LYING.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.954
GET A SEARCH WARRANT.
WE NEED TO FIND OUT

09:13.987 --> 09:15.355
WHAT REALLY WENT DOWN
IN THAT STAIRWELL.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.591
- IF SOMETHING WENT DOWN
IN THAT STAIRWELL.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.860
- IF?
MAN, HE DRAGGED HER OUT.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.661
IT'S NO CONCERN.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.195
- YEAH, HAVE YOU
EVER TRIED TO MOVE

09:22.229 --> 09:24.031
100 POUNDS OF PASSED-OUT
DRUNK?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.298
IT AIN'T EASY.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.101
- SHE'S COVERING FOR HIM.
FIN, YOU SAW IT.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.903
HE'S CONTROLLING.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.639
HIS LITTLE SON
WAS TERRIFIED OF HIM.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.040
- I WAS TERRIFIED
OF MY MOTHER.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.342
WHEN I USED TO ACT A FOOL,
SHE'D BEAT MY ASS.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.010
- YEAH, I WAS RAISED
THE SAME WAY.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.146
IN THE SOUTH, YOU HAVE
TO PICK OUT YOUR OWN SWITCH.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.214
- SO NOW WE'RE MAKING
CULTURAL EXEMPTIONS?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.984
- YOU KNOW, MY FATHER,
HE WENT AT ME WITH HIS FISTS.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.687
IT TAUGHT ME YOU NEVER LAY
A HAND ON A CHILD,

09:46.720 --> 09:48.021
OR A WOMAN.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.356
- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A.J.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.759
COULD HAVE BEEN FENDING HER OFF.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.160
- FENDING HER OFF?
[cell phone rings]

09:53.193 --> 09:55.829
- HE'S TWICE HER SIZE.
HE SHOULD HAVE JUST WALKED AWAY.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.097
- OKAY, GREAT.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.265
- WHAT?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.168
WHEN?

10:01.201 --> 10:03.270
OKAY, LMZ, GUYS, NOW.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.211
- WELL, HOW THE HELL
DID THEY GET THAT?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.914
- THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.
THEY PAID FOR IT.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.124
- THAT SON OF A BITCH.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.194
- THAT...

10:38.672 --> 10:38.872
.

10:38.906 --> 10:39.673
- HEY, GIVE US A LITTLE ROOM,
OKAY?

10:40.607 --> 10:42.042
I'M SO SORRY
WHAT YOU MUST BE GOING THROUGH.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.210
WITH THAT VIDEO OUT THERE,

10:43.243 --> 10:44.912
UNFORTUNATELY
THERE'S NO SHIELD LAW

10:44.945 --> 10:47.080
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.116
- I'M NOT A VICTIM.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.785
- I'LL NEED A WORD
WITH MY CLIENTS.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.286
- AND I'LL NEED MR. MARTIN
AND MS. BRYANT

10:53.320 --> 10:55.322
INTERVIEWED SEPARATELY.
- THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.691
- IT'S OKAY, A.J.
YOU'LL BOTH BE WITH COUNSEL.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.159
BRIAN?
- ON IT, BOSS.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.161
- OKAY, WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.067
- WOMEN ARE FLIRTING.
I TRY TO BE NICE,

11:07.100 --> 11:10.137
POSE FOR A SELFIE,
AUTOGRAPH A JERSEY.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.905
- THAT IS VERY NICE OF YOU.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.842
- WE'RE JUST PUTTING THE EVENTS
OF THE EVENING IN CONTEXT.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.444
- OKAY, SO YOU WERE FLIRTING,
AND PAULA GOT MAD.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.112
- I KNOW THAT THOSE GIRLS
ARE HIS FANS,

11:19.146 --> 11:20.848
BUT THEY GOT TO KNOW
THAT HE'S MINE.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.483
- AND YOU...EXPRESSED THAT?

11:23.516 --> 11:24.818
- YEAH.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.186
I STARTED IN;
I WAS GETTING LOUD.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.488
- WHICH MADE A.J. ANGRY.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.522
- [laughs]

11:29.556 --> 11:32.793
I EMBARRASSED HIM IN FRONT
OF IMPORTANT PEOPLE.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.027
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.162
- SHE WAS STUMBLING.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.730
SHE COULD HAVE HURT HERSELF.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.831
I HAD TO STOP HER.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.967
- WITH YOUR FIST.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.735
- I HAD SIPPED
ON A FEW MYSELF.

11:41.769 --> 11:42.602
- HOW MANY?

11:42.635 --> 11:44.071
- YOU DON'T NEED TO GET
INTO THAT, A.J.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.138
- WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

11:45.172 --> 11:47.775
MY REFLEXES WEREN'T 100%.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.442
- THEY SEEMED PRETTY SHARP
TO ME.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.111
- A.J. WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.046
- BY LAYING YOU OUT
IN THE STAIRWELL?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.514
- WHAT'S WITH THE ANIMOSITY,
DETECTIVE?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.450
- WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.487
- WE ALREADY TOLD THE NYPD
WHAT HAPPENED.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.823
LOOK, WE ARE PUTTING IT
BEHIND US.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.024
WHY CAN'T Y'ALL?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.926
[door opens]
WE TOLD THE OFFICERS...

12:05.959 --> 12:07.494
- HEY.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.996
SORRY, HAD TO START WITHOUT YOU.

12:09.029 --> 12:09.997
- I'M SURE.

12:10.030 --> 12:10.864
WHAT'S THEIR STORY?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.833
- THEY WERE DRUNK,
SHE WAS STUMBLING,

12:12.866 --> 12:14.501
AND HE HAD TO STOP HER.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.503
WHAT I SAW WAS AN ASSAULT.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.171
- WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.940
LET'S HOPE THAT THAT VIDEO
IS DAMNING ENOUGH

12:19.973 --> 12:21.775
HE WON'T WANT THIS
GOING TO TRIAL.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.877
- TRIAL?

12:23.911 --> 12:25.078
YOU WANT TO PLEA THIS DOWN?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.079
HE SHOULD BE IN JAIL.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.180
- YEAH, HE SHOULD.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.515
BUT HE'S PERSONABLE,
CHARISMATIC.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.817
PAULA SUPPORTS HIM.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.884
THE JURY'S GONNA WANT
TO FORGIVE HIM.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.019
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.486
WE SHOULD JUST SLAP HIM
ON THE WRIST

12:33.520 --> 12:34.922
AND SEND HIM HOME.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.193
- A.J. WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF,

12:40.227 --> 12:42.029
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO MAKE A REASONABLE OFFER,

12:42.062 --> 12:43.463
WE'LL HEAR YOU OUT.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.799
- THE OTHER D.A. SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT ANGER MANAGEMENT.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.834
WE'LL GO.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.568
A.A., WHATEVER IT TAKES.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.037
- GOOD FOR YOU.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.072
ACKNOWLEDGING THERE
WAS NO SERIOUS INJURY,

12:52.105 --> 12:53.473
ASSAULT III, 90 DAYS.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.042
- ASSAULT III, NO JAIL TIME,

12:55.075 --> 12:56.576
200 HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.744
- A.J.'S GONNA HAVE TO DO
A LOT MORE

12:57.777 --> 13:00.981
THAN PICK UP GARBAGE WITH
A POINTY STICK FOR THIS ONE.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.917
- MY CLIENT HAS ALREADY BEEN
SUSPENDED BY HIS NETWORK.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.119
ASSAULT III WITH JAIL TIME
IS AN OVERREACH.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.520
SHE DIDN'T EVEN GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.889
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.157
THIS IS REALLY
RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.558
GROSS DISREGARD FOR HER SAFETY

13:11.591 --> 13:12.860
WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED
SERIOUS INJURY.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.461
- YOU WANT US TO PLEAD
TO A FELONY?

13:14.494 --> 13:15.896
- I NEVER HURT PAULA.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.197
SHE'LL BACK ME UP ON THAT.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.166
- YOU HEARD THE MAN.
WE'LL SEE YOU IN COURT.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.234
- FINE, TOMORROW, 9:00 A.M.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.879
- ON THE CHARGE
OF RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT,

13:31.912 --> 13:32.579
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.982
- MY CLIENT PLEADS NOT GUILTY.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.083
- AND FOR BAIL?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.550
- PEOPLE REQUEST REMAND,
YOUR HONOR,

13:37.584 --> 13:38.685
GIVEN THE VIOLENCE
OF THE ATTACK

13:38.718 --> 13:41.989
AND THE CALLOUS DISREGARD
FOR THE VICTIM AFTERWARDS.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.456
- MR. MARTIN
IS A FIRST-TIME OFFENDER

13:43.490 --> 13:44.524
WITH A YOUNG SON.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.326
HE'S NO FLIGHT RISK.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.427
- AGREED.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.930
I'M SETTING BAIL AT $20,000.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.231
[gavel strikes]

14:01.608 --> 14:04.511
- PAULA, CAN I JUST TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

14:04.544 --> 14:05.645
- WHY?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.380
IF YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE

14:07.414 --> 14:09.382
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE
PUTTING MY FAMILY THROUGH,

14:09.416 --> 14:10.884
IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.120
JUNIOR IS BEING HARASSED
AT SCHOOL.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.621
A.J.'S BROADCASTING CAREER
IS OVER.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.124
- OKAY, PAULA, I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS A LONG TIME,

14:17.157 --> 14:19.626
AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF MEN
LIKE A.J.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.528
- THERE'S ONLY ONE A.J.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.529
BEST BELIEVE.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.531
- AND HE'S YOUR SOUL MATE.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.498
AND I'M SURE
THAT THERE ARE TIMES

14:25.532 --> 14:30.904
THAT HE MAKES YOU FEEL
INCREDIBLY SPECIAL.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.106
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE UP
FOR THE TIMES

14:33.140 --> 14:35.208
WHEN HE LAYS HANDS ON YOU.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.576
- HE SLIPPED.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.946
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE THE WHOLE WORLD

14:38.979 --> 14:40.580
WATCHING US
AT OUR WORST MOMENT?

14:40.613 --> 14:42.249
TO BE JUDGING US
BY A SPLIT SECOND--

14:42.282 --> 14:45.652
- IF YOU CAN LOOK ME
IN THE EYE RIGHT NOW,

14:45.685 --> 14:49.156
AND TELL ME
THIS HAS ONLY HAPPENED ONCE...

14:52.725 --> 14:54.561
I'LL BELIEVE YOU.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.507
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.676
- AND WHY IS THAT?

15:09.709 --> 15:12.712
BECAUSE A STRONG BLACK MAN
CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.948
HE HAS TO BE TAKEN DOWN A NOTCH,
RIGHT?

15:14.982 --> 15:16.116
BY THE LEGAL SYSTEM,

15:16.149 --> 15:18.018
BY THE PUBLIC,
BY YOU.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.620
- I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR SAFETY.

15:20.653 --> 15:24.157
I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR SON'S SAFETY.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.725
I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT...

15:25.758 --> 15:29.729
THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION
OF BLACK MEN.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.432
- WELL, WE'RE LIVING
AS A FAMILY,

15:32.465 --> 15:34.601
AND A.J. NEEDS ME,

15:34.634 --> 15:36.703
JUST AS MUCH AS I NEED HIM.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.143
- SERGEANT BENSON,

15:43.176 --> 15:44.978
I'M SURE THIS
IS JUST SMALL TALK,

15:45.012 --> 15:47.580
BUT YOU KNOW NOT TO SPEAK
TO PAULA WITHOUT HER COUNSEL.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.948
PAULA.
- THANK YOU.

15:53.686 --> 15:57.024
- A.J., PAULA, AND I
HAVE BEEN PRAYING TOGETHER

15:57.057 --> 16:01.328
AND WORKING THROUGH THIS
EMOTIONALLY AND SPIRITUALLY.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.662
PAULA, YOU WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING?

16:02.695 --> 16:04.064
- THANK YOU, REVEREND CURTIS.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.671
I JUST WANT
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

16:11.704 --> 16:16.576
THERE ARE PEOPLE INVESTED
IN ME PLAYING THE VICTIM HERE.

16:16.609 --> 16:20.447
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.249
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR PROVOKING

16:22.282 --> 16:25.785
THE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS
OF SIX WEEKS AGO.

16:25.818 --> 16:30.690
A.J. AND I ARE WORKING
ON OUR ISSUES.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.726
ALL WE ASK NOW
IS FOR PRIVACY.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.262
[reporters clamoring]

16:35.295 --> 16:37.397
- WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY QUESTIONS
TODAY, THANK YOU.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.599
- YOU AGREE SHE PROVOKED YOU?
[reporters shouting]

16:39.632 --> 16:41.401
- COME ON.
FOLLOW ME.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.571
- WHAT ABOUT THE VIDEO?
[reporters shouting]

16:44.604 --> 16:46.573
- SO, A.J,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY

16:46.606 --> 16:48.708
TO YOUR FANS
AND YOUR DETRACTORS?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.643
- I WOULD SAY,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.680
DON'T BELIEVE THE GUTTER PRESS.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.583
OUR HATERS CAN'T BRING US DOWN.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.453
WE ARE DEEPENING OUR COMMITMENT
TO EACH OTHER EVERY DAY.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.722
- YEAH, AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.525
MINE AND A.J.'S,
IT'S FOR THE LONG HAUL.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.227
- ARE YOU WATCHING THIS?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.562
- THE NEXT STEP
ON THE APOLOGY TOUR, YEAH.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.531
- SO IN THE SPIRIT
OF THAT DEEPENED COMMITMENT,

17:11.564 --> 17:13.733
I HEAR YOU TWO HAVE NEWS.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.136
- YEAH, UM...

17:16.169 --> 17:18.405
A.J. PROPOSED.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.640
- WOW, THAT IS GR--
HOW MANY CARATS IS THAT?

17:20.673 --> 17:22.175
- 15 CARATS.

17:22.209 --> 17:25.745
IT'S THE SAME AS A.J.'S
RETIRED JERSEY NUMBER.

17:25.778 --> 17:30.383
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
LATER ON TODAY.

17:30.417 --> 17:34.154
- "WHAT THEREFORE
GOD HATH JOINED TOGETHER,

17:44.431 --> 17:44.631
.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.532
- DOCTOR, BESIDE
THE OBVIOUS SIZE DIFFERENCE,

17:46.133 --> 17:47.634
WHAT ARE THE OTHER FACTORS

17:47.667 --> 17:49.869
THAT MIGHT MAKE
MR. MARTIN'S FISTS

17:49.902 --> 17:51.804
MORE DANGEROUS
THAN THE AVERAGE MAN HIS AGE.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.574
- ON AVERAGE,
RETIRED PRO FOOTBALL PLAYERS

17:54.607 --> 17:57.377
RETAIN 20% HIGHER BONE DENSITY

17:57.410 --> 17:59.812
AND A 13% HIGHER MUSCLE MASS
THAN OTHER MEN.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.684
- WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE
THE FORCE OF THE BLOW

18:04.717 --> 18:06.553
THE DEFENDANT DELIVERED
TO MRS. MARTIN

18:06.586 --> 18:08.488
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION?
- YES.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.857
USING THE STANDARD
FORCE ALGORITHM,

18:10.890 --> 18:13.760
WITH HIS WEIGHT AND MUSCLE MASS,

18:13.793 --> 18:15.795
A.J. MARTIN'S FIST
HIT PAULA'S FACE

18:15.828 --> 18:19.666
AT MORE THAN 700 POUNDS
PER SQUARE INCH,

18:19.699 --> 18:21.201
FOUR TIMES THE FORCE

18:21.234 --> 18:24.337
YOUR AVERAGE MIDDLE-AGED
COUCH POTATO COULD EXERT.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.738
- IN YOUR OPINION,

18:25.772 --> 18:28.375
WAS THIS PUNCH CAPABLE
OF CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY TO

18:28.408 --> 18:30.510
OR EVEN OF KILLING MRS. MARTIN?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.579
- ABSOLUTELY.
- WHY DIDN'T IT?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.646
- BECAUSE SHE GOT LUCKY.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.681
- YOUR HONOR.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.383
- JURY WILL DISREGARD.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.151
- NOTHING FURTHER.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.655
- AS A MEDICAL EXAMINER,
IS IT FAIR TO SAY

18:42.689 --> 18:46.426
YOU SPEND MORE TIME EXAMINING
DEAD BODIES THAN LIVE ONES?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.328
- I PERFORM AUTOPSIES,

18:48.361 --> 18:51.198
BUT I EVALUATE THE LIVING
WHEN REQUIRED.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.566
- BUT YOU DIDN'T PERFORM
A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

18:53.600 --> 18:56.403
ON EITHER MR. OR MRS. MARTIN,
DID YOU?

18:56.436 --> 18:57.404
- NO.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.938
- HOW ABOUT AN MRI, A CAT SCAN?

18:58.971 --> 19:02.742
DID YOU LOOK AT ANY
MEDICAL RECORDS AT ALL?

19:02.775 --> 19:03.776
- NO.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.878
- SO YOUR SPECULATION

19:05.912 --> 19:09.649
IS BASED ON ONE ANGLE OF
A GRAINY BLACK-AND-WHITE VIDEO.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.284
OH, AND SOME MATH.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.686
EXCUSE ME, AN ALGORITHM.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.887
- THAT'S CORRECT.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.357
- AND IN YOUR OPINION,

19:17.390 --> 19:18.558
THE ACTION YOU SAW

19:18.591 --> 19:21.594
COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE
SERIOUS INJURY.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.563
- OR NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.731
DEATH, EVEN.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.766
- AND YET, MINUTES LATER,

19:26.799 --> 19:28.435
MRS. MARTIN WAS CARRYING ON

19:28.468 --> 19:31.504
A COHERENT CONVERSATION
WITH A POLICE OFFICER.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.774
IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH SOMEONE
SUFFERING SERIOUS BRAIN INJURY?

19:34.807 --> 19:37.577
- SOME NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS
TAKE TIME TO DEVELOP.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.980
- IT HAS BEEN SIX WEEKS.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.216
SHE'S SITTING RIGHT THERE.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.452
LOOKS FINE TO ME.
- OBJECTION.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.520
- WITHDRAWN.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.356
NOTHING FURTHER.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.627
- EVEN AFTER WE SHOWED
MRS. MARTIN THE FOOTAGE

19:54.661 --> 19:57.464
OF MR. MARTIN STRIKING HER,

19:57.497 --> 20:01.634
SHE CONTINUED TO INSIST
THAT IT WAS HER FAULT.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.370
NOW, THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON

20:03.403 --> 20:05.605
FOR VICTIMS
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.307
IT'S ALSO NOT UNCOMMON

20:07.340 --> 20:09.642
FOR VICTIMS
TO REFUSE TO TESTIFY.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.643
- WHY'S THAT?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.745
- SOME ARE EMOTIONALLY

20:12.779 --> 20:14.947
OR FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT
ON THEIR ABUSER.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.016
SOME ARE SCARED OF REPRISALS.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.753
AND A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE IS MOST AT RISK

20:20.787 --> 20:25.858
WHEN SHE GOES AGAINST HER ABUSER
OR TRIES TO LEAVE.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.728
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS

20:28.761 --> 20:30.297
WERE CHANGED IN NEW YORK,

20:30.330 --> 20:33.733
TO PROTECT PEOPLE
WHO ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING

20:33.766 --> 20:35.335
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

20:35.368 --> 20:38.371
JUST BECAUSE A PERSON
CAN'T ADMIT

20:38.405 --> 20:42.642
OR IS IN DENIAL
ABOUT THEIR ABUSE,

20:42.675 --> 20:47.680
DOESN'T MEANT THAT THE ABUSE
DIDN'T HAPPEN, OR WON'T WORSEN.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.417
- THANK YOU.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.784
- SERGEANT BENSON,

20:51.818 --> 20:55.922
DID MRS. MARTIN EXPRESS FEAR
OF HER HUSBAND TO YOU?

20:55.955 --> 20:56.923
- NOT DIRECTLY, NO.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.559
- DID SHE CITE FINANCIAL
OR EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCE

20:59.592 --> 21:01.594
AS REASONS NOT TO TESTIFY?

21:01.628 --> 21:02.662
- SHE DID NOT.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.831
- SO IT'S POSSIBLE
THE REASON SHE'S NOT TESTIFYING,

21:04.864 --> 21:06.533
THE REASON SHE MARRIED
MR. MARTIN,

21:06.566 --> 21:07.867
IS BECAUSE SHE'S
IN LOVE WITH HIM

21:07.900 --> 21:09.669
AND BELIEVES HE'LL BE
A GOOD HUSBAND.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.571
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAW
ON THE VIDEO.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.607
- YOU DO KNOW MY CLIENT
HAS EXPRESSED REGRET

21:14.641 --> 21:19.346
AND AGREED TO ANGER MANAGEMENT
AND SPIRITUAL COUNSELING.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.381
- YES, AND I'VE
HEARD THAT BEFORE.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.784
- SERGEANT, DO YOU BELIEVE
IN THE REHABILITATIVE POWER

21:24.817 --> 21:26.486
OF ANGER MANAGEMENT?

21:29.389 --> 21:30.523
NOT ALWAYS, NO.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.325
- WASN'T A DETECTIVE
IN YOUR SQUAD

21:32.359 --> 21:34.861
WHO SEVERELY BEAT A CIVILIAN

21:34.894 --> 21:36.596
RECENTLY RETURNED TO ACTIVE DUTY

21:36.629 --> 21:39.332
AFTER A SHORT STINT
IN ANGER MANAGEMENT?

21:39.366 --> 21:40.533
- OBJECTION, RELEVANCE.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.370
- GOES TO HER EXPERT OPINION,
YOUR HONOR.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.037
- WITNESS MAY ANSWER.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.610
- MY DETECTIVE LOST HIS TEMPER

21:50.643 --> 21:54.714
WITH A HORRIFIC CHILD ABUSER,

21:54.747 --> 21:56.649
NOT HIS WIFE.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.817
- BUT YOUR POINT IS,

21:57.850 --> 22:00.853
ANGER MANAGEMENT
IS SUFFICIENT ENOUGH

22:00.887 --> 22:04.524
FOR A VIOLENT POLICE OFFICER
TO GET HIS GUN BACK

22:04.557 --> 22:07.427
BUT INSUFFICIENT
TO REHABILITATE A.J. MARTIN,

22:07.460 --> 22:09.896
A MAN WITHOUT SO MUCH
AS A PRIOR SPEEDING TICKET.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.097
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.365
- I'M SORRY.

22:12.399 --> 22:13.700
I WON'T ASK ANYMORE QUESTIONS

22:13.733 --> 22:16.536
ABOUT THE SERGEANT'S
DOUBLE STANDARD.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.770
WITHDRAWN.

22:19.972 --> 22:23.342
[whispering]

22:28.014 --> 22:29.449
- I GREW UP IN A HOME

22:29.482 --> 22:31.818
WHERE MY FATHER TOOK HIS FISTS
TO MY MOTHER.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.421
WE LIVED IN FEAR.

22:34.454 --> 22:38.725
WHAT A.J. DID,
THERE'S NO EXCUSE, EVER.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.593
- HEY.
- HEY.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.830
I STARTED WITHOUT YOU.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.932
- WENT TO THE GYM FIRST.
WHAT SHE'S HAVING, PLEASE.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.400
- AND A REFILL, PLEASE.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.436
YOU CAN MAKE IT NEAT THIS TIME.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.173
YOU OKAY?

22:54.206 --> 22:56.108
THAT WAS ROUGH.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.910
- WELL, CALHOUN'S
JUST DOING HER JOB.

22:57.944 --> 23:01.714
- YEAH, BUT SHE HAD NO RIGHT
TO GO AFTER YOU LIKE THAT.

23:01.748 --> 23:02.815
SHE'S GOT A POINT, THOUGH.

23:02.849 --> 23:03.916
- YEAH.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.485
WHAT POINT IS THAT?

23:05.518 --> 23:06.919
- THAT IT'S A PRIVATE--

23:06.953 --> 23:09.456
PRIVATE MATTER
BETWEEN PAULA MARTIN

23:09.489 --> 23:12.024
AND HER HUSBAND.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.593
I JUST THINK WE'RE OVERREACHING.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.728
- AMANDA, HE HIT HER, RIGHT?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.129
END OF STORY.
CHEERS.

23:17.163 --> 23:20.166
- WAIT, SO WE GET TO DECIDE

23:20.199 --> 23:21.901
WHAT'S BEST FOR HER?

23:21.934 --> 23:23.870
THAT'S INFANTILIZING.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.138
THAT'S...

23:26.172 --> 23:27.574
[scoffs]

23:27.607 --> 23:30.610
THAT'S US MAKING HER A VICTIM
ALL OVER AGAIN.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.411
- ALL RIGHT, JUST TAKE IT EASY.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.516
- YOU COUNTING MY DRINKS NOW?

23:40.753 --> 23:41.888
SAINT NICK?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.856
RIGHT?
SAVIOR OF DAMAGED WOMEN?

23:43.890 --> 23:44.857
- STOP.

23:44.891 --> 23:45.892
ALL I'M SAYING IS,

23:45.925 --> 23:47.594
NO MAN HAS A RIGHT
TO HIT A WOMAN.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.861
- THAT'S RIGHT;
THAT'S RIGHT.

23:48.895 --> 23:52.064
BUT SOME OF US
DON'T NEED TO BE SAVED.

23:52.098 --> 23:55.702
OKAY, LIKE, YOU MARRIED
A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T, RIGHT?

23:55.735 --> 23:56.703
MARIA?
HA HA.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.971
I SAW THE WAY SHE WENT
AFTER YOU IN THE SQUAD--

23:59.005 --> 24:00.206
- I NEVER LAID A HAND
ON MARIA.

24:00.239 --> 24:03.543
- YEAH, BUT YOU NEVER WANTED TO?
NOT AT ALL?

24:03.576 --> 24:04.977
SHE GOT TO YOU.

24:05.011 --> 24:07.146
SHE STILL GETS TO YOU.
- RIGHT.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.582
- HUH, THAT DOESN'T GET TO YOU?

24:09.616 --> 24:11.083
- NO.
- HMM?

24:12.585 --> 24:13.753
COME ON.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.555
LIKE THAT?
THAT WOULDN'T GET TO YOU?

24:15.588 --> 24:16.556
- NO.
- REALLY?

24:16.589 --> 24:17.557
HOW ABOUT THAT?

24:17.590 --> 24:18.658
COME ON, NICK, I KNOW IT DOES.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.892
- ARE YOU JEALOUS
OF MARIA NOW?

24:19.926 --> 24:22.028
IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
- REALLY?

24:22.061 --> 24:23.563
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

24:23.596 --> 24:24.897
- WAIT, WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

24:24.931 --> 24:26.499
- JUST--YOU, NICK.
- HEY.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.934
- NO, NO, NO,
JUST DROP THE ROCK.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.569
- SETTLE DOWN.
- NO, NO, NO.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.237
WE'VE JUST ALL SEEN YOU.
WE'VE ALL SEEN YOU LOSE IT.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.605
THE WHOLE SQUAD ROOM HEARD YOU

24:32.639 --> 24:34.140
YELLING AT YOUR WIFE
ON THE PHONE.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.075
OKAY, I'M JUST SAY--
LISTEN!

24:36.108 --> 24:38.077
PAULA MARTIN
HAS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE

24:38.110 --> 24:40.580
WHETHER SHE PRESSES CHARGES
OR NOT.

24:40.613 --> 24:41.581
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY?

24:41.614 --> 24:42.849
'CAUSE SOME OF US
DON'T WANT TO BE VICTIMS.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.584
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
A VICTIM.

24:44.617 --> 24:45.585
- HEY!
[chair clatters]

24:45.618 --> 24:47.654
- AH.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.656
[glass shatters]

24:49.689 --> 24:51.190
[laughing]

24:51.223 --> 24:52.759
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:52.792 --> 24:54.060
- [laughing]
SORRY.

24:54.093 --> 24:57.296
- I'M GONNA DO WHAT A.J. MARTIN
SHOULD HAVE DONE.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.865
WALK AWAY.

25:12.044 --> 25:12.244
.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.279
- A.J. MARTIN'S ACTIONS
CONSTITUTE BEHAVIOR THAT WE

25:13.913 --> 25:16.649
CANNOT AND WILL NOT TOLERATE

25:16.683 --> 25:18.985
FROM EITHER CURRENT ATHLETES
OR RETIRED PLAYERS.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.620
THE LEAGUE WANTS
TO SEND A MESSAGE

25:20.653 --> 25:23.656
AND SEND IT
VERY LOUD AND CLEAR.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.192
NEVER, EVER IS THERE AN EXCUSE

25:26.225 --> 25:28.961
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
OR CHILD ABUSE.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.196
I'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.198
- THIS GUY'S GOT
NO FRIENDS LEFT.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.266
- YEAH, SO SHE GETS TARRED TOO?

25:34.300 --> 25:35.702
TALK ABOUT BRUTALIZATION.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.304
I MEAN, HOW IS THIS FAIR
TO PAULA MARTIN?

25:38.337 --> 25:41.073
THIS VIDEO BEING PLAYED
OVER AND OVER.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.341
IT'S THE WORST NIGHT
OF HER LIFE

25:42.374 --> 25:45.011
FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.079
- YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.314
BUT HE DID HIT HER, AMANDA.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.049
- ALL I KNOW IS,
YOU CAN'T SAVE SOMEBODY

25:50.082 --> 25:52.719
THAT DOESN'T WANT TO BE SAVED.
TRUST ME, I'VE TRIED.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.154
- NICK AGREE WITH THAT?

25:55.187 --> 25:58.357
- NICK THINKS HE CAN SAVE
THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.959
- [laughs]

25:59.992 --> 26:01.761
LISTEN.

26:01.794 --> 26:05.865
I'VE LEARNED TWO THINGS
IN MY 15 YEARS HERE AT SVU.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.201
ONE IS YOU CAN'T TAKE
THIS JOB HOME WITH YOU.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.237
- WORKING ON THAT.

26:11.270 --> 26:16.042
- TWO IS YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYONE
FROM THIS JOB HOME WITH YOU.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.977
- RIGHT.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.713
- I JUST WANT YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, OKAY?

26:20.747 --> 26:23.683
- I HEAR YOU, FIN.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.985
I HEAR YOU.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.856
- A.J. AND PAULA
ARE TWO GOOD PEOPLE

26:29.889 --> 26:31.057
WHO LOVE ONE ANOTHER,

26:31.090 --> 26:34.126
BUT THEY BOTH GREW UP
IN HOMES WHERE...

26:34.160 --> 26:36.663
DISPUTES GOT PHYSICAL.

26:36.696 --> 26:40.199
I MEAN, THIS IS LEARNED BEHAVIOR
THEY'RE TRYING TO CHANGE.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.901
- I SEE.
AND HAVE YOU EVER WITNESSED

26:41.934 --> 26:44.637
AN INCIDENT THAT TROUBLED YOU?

26:46.773 --> 26:48.007
- THEY BOTH TOLD ME SEPARATELY

26:48.040 --> 26:50.109
THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR
HAS TROUBLED THEM,

26:50.142 --> 26:52.712
AND SO THEY'RE WORKING
ON FINDING POSITIVE WAYS

26:52.745 --> 26:54.413
TO COMMUNICATE.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.315
- YOU WERE
AT THEIR RECENT WEDDING.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.417
- I PERFORMED THE CEREMONY.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.386
THEY DID WAIT TO GET MARRIED,

27:00.419 --> 27:02.755
BUT THESE TWO HAVE BEEN
COMMITTED TO EACH OTHER

27:02.789 --> 27:04.156
FOR TEN YEARS.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.792
THEY'RE RAISING A WONDERFUL SON.

27:05.825 --> 27:11.297
THEIRS IS A SOLID, LOVING
CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE OF EQUALS.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.365
- THANK YOU, REVEREND.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.203
- A MARRIAGE OF EQUALS,
REVEREND?

27:17.236 --> 27:18.204
- THAT'S RIGHT.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.340
- EVEN THOUGH HE OUT-EARNS HER
BY 100 TIMES?

27:21.373 --> 27:23.209
DON'T YOU THINK THAT MIGHT
MAKE HER DEPENDENT ON HIM?

27:23.242 --> 27:25.111
- HE DEPENDS ON HER AS WELL,

27:25.144 --> 27:26.312
TO MAKE THEIR HOME,
RAISE THEIR CHILD.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.447
- THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME
YOU'VE SPENT WITH THE MARTINS

27:28.480 --> 27:29.448
HAS BEEN IN COUNSELING?

27:29.481 --> 27:30.917
- I SEE THEM IN CHURCH AS WELL.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.419
- BUT YOU WEREN'T
IN THE GARAGE THAT NIGHT.

27:33.452 --> 27:36.188
HAVE YOU BEEN WITH THEM WHEN
MR. MARTIN HAS BEEN DRINKING?

27:36.222 --> 27:39.225
- DRINKING IS ANOTHER ISSUE
THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.761
- IS IT FAIR TO SAY
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW

27:41.794 --> 27:43.696
HOW MR. MARTIN ACTS
TOWARDS HIS WIFE

27:43.730 --> 27:45.297
WHEN THEY'RE NOT
ON THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.866
- I HAVE NEVER
WITNESSED ANYTHING

27:46.899 --> 27:49.702
OTHER THAN A GENUINE LOVE
FOR EACH OTHER.

27:49.736 --> 27:53.072
- REVEREND, AS A MORAL MAN,

27:53.105 --> 27:55.374
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE VIDEO

27:55.407 --> 27:59.979
THAT SHOWS MR. MARTIN
CLEARLY PUNCHING HIS WIFE?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.180
- I DIDN'T WATCH IT.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.315
- IS THAT BECAUSE MR. MARTIN'S
LAWYER ADVISED YOU NOT TO?

28:03.349 --> 28:06.152
- OBJECTION.
- WITHDRAWN.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.286
NOTHING FURTHER.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.324
- I LOVE MY WIFE.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.760
SHE'S MY LIFE,

28:13.793 --> 28:16.195
THE MOTHER OF MY SON.

28:16.228 --> 28:19.131
I WILL ALWAYS REGRET THAT NIGHT.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.400
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD,
I DIDN'T INTEND TO HURT HER.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.870
- THAT VIDEO MAY SEEM DAMNING,

28:23.903 --> 28:27.273
AND YOU KNOW THE PROSECUTOR
IS GOING TO USE IT AGAINST YOU.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.741
CAN YOU TELL THE JURY

28:28.775 --> 28:32.444
WHY YOU DECIDED
TO TESTIFY TODAY?

28:32.478 --> 28:34.113
- PAULA HAS HAD THE STRENGTH

28:34.146 --> 28:36.382
TO SIT IN THIS COURTROOM
EVERY DAY.

28:36.415 --> 28:40.252
I'M FILLED WITH SUCH HUMILITY,
ADMIRATION,

28:40.286 --> 28:44.824
AND SUCH DEEP GRATITUDE.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.359
IF SHE CAN BE BRAVE ENOUGH
TO SIT IN HERE,

28:47.393 --> 28:50.863
I CAN BE BRAVE ENOUGH TOO.

28:50.897 --> 28:54.300
I WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

28:54.333 --> 28:58.337
I WANT TO TEACH MY SON
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MAN.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.106
- THANK YOU.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.074
- MR. MARTIN, DO YOU BELIEVE

29:02.108 --> 29:03.776
THAT TEACHING YOUR SON
TO BE A MAN

29:03.810 --> 29:05.344
MEANS TEACHING HIM
TO TELL THE TRUTH?

29:05.377 --> 29:06.445
- YES, I DO.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.881
- YET, ON THE NIGHT
OF THE INCIDENT,

29:08.915 --> 29:12.218
YOU TOLD THE POLICE THAT YOUR
WIFE HAD SLIPPED AND FALLEN,

29:12.251 --> 29:13.219
WHICH WAS UNTRUE.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.321
- YES.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.790
BUT I KNOW NOW
THAT THAT WAS WRONG.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.191
- NOW THAT THE VIDEO
HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC

29:19.225 --> 29:20.359
AND YOU'RE ON TRIAL?

29:20.392 --> 29:22.061
- I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.295
- YOU MEAN YOURSELF.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.264
I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS MOMENT.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.434
YOUR TESTIMONY, UNDER OATH,

29:28.467 --> 29:31.503
IS THAT YOU DID NOT
DELIBERATELY STRIKE YOUR WIFE.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.339
- I PUT UP MY HAND TO STOP HER.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.208
IT WAS A REFLEX ACTION.
- SO IT'S HER FAULT?

29:36.242 --> 29:38.410
- I DID NOT INTEND TO HURT HER.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.846
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL 911?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.981
- BECAUSE SHE CAME TO
IN A FEW MINUTES.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.249
- YOU WERE
A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.317
YOU'RE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL
DANGERS OF LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS,

29:45.351 --> 29:46.886
EVEN FOR A BRIEF TIME.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.254
AND YET,
YOU CHOSE TO IGNORE THAT?

29:48.287 --> 29:50.189
- I MADE A JUDGMENT CALL.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.590
- YOU MADE A JUDGMENT CALL?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.359
TO PUNCH A WOMAN IN THE FACE,

29:53.392 --> 29:56.162
TO DRAG HER UNCONSCIOUS BODY
ACROSS A GARAGE,

29:56.195 --> 29:58.831
AND ATTEMPT TO GET OUT OF THERE
BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIND OUT?

29:58.865 --> 30:00.432
- OBJECTION.
- HOW DARE YOU--I LOVE MY WIFE.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.500
- I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU DO.

30:01.533 --> 30:02.902
- YOUR HONOR.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.203
- IT'S A CROSS-EXAMINATION,
MS. CALHOUN.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.204
I'LL ALLOW IT.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.172
- DID YOU LOVE HER HERE,

30:06.205 --> 30:08.007
WHEN YOU WERE MANHANDLING HER?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.876
HOW ABOUT HERE,

30:09.909 --> 30:12.044
WHEN YOUR FIST CONNECTED
WITH HER FACE?

30:12.078 --> 30:13.245
OR DID YOU REALLY LOVE HER HERE,

30:13.279 --> 30:14.881
WHEN YOU WERE DRAGGING
HER LIMP BODY

30:14.914 --> 30:16.883
LIKE A BAG OF GARBAGE
WITH NO EVIDENT CONCERN?

30:16.916 --> 30:17.850
- OBJECTION.

30:17.884 --> 30:21.020
- ALL RIGHT, MR. BARBA,
TIME TO MOVE ALONG.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.556
- HE OPENED THE DOOR,
YOUR HONOR.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.426
BUT IF THIS IS HOW MR. MARTIN
SHOWS HE LOVES HIS WIFE,

30:27.459 --> 30:29.195
THEN I'M DONE.

30:36.635 --> 30:39.371
- BEFORE WE BRING THE JURY
BACK IN FROM LUNCH,

30:39.405 --> 30:41.573
ARE YOU PREPARED FOR YOUR
CLOSING ARGUMENT, MS. CALHOUN?

30:41.607 --> 30:42.474
- ACTUALLY, YOUR HONOR,

30:42.508 --> 30:44.543
I WOULD LIKE TO CALL
ONE LAST WITNESS,

30:44.576 --> 30:47.379
PAULA MARTIN.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.480
- YOUR HONOR, APPROACH?

30:54.486 --> 30:56.222
THIS WITNESS WAS NOT
ON THE LIST.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.590
- MRS. MARTIN ONLY NOW
DECIDED TO TESTIFY.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.626
SHE SAW HER MARRIAGE
AND HER HUSBAND ATTACKED.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.128
SHE WANTS TO DEFEND.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.329
- SHE HAS BEEN SITTING
IN THIS COURTROOM

31:03.362 --> 31:04.663
THE ENTIRE TRIAL.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.366
- SHE LIVES WITH THE DEFENDANT.

31:07.399 --> 31:11.603
WHATEVER SHE HEARD IN COURT,
SHE'S ALREADY HEARD AT HOME.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.272
I'LL ALLOW IT.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.313
- HEY, HOW'S IT LOOKING?

31:21.347 --> 31:23.315
- SEVEN WOMEN ON THE JURY,
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.116
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.084
- OKAY, SO AT LEAST
TWO OF THEM

31:25.117 --> 31:27.253
WILL BE LOOKING TO BLAME HER
AND EXCUSE HIM.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.587
- NEXT PROBLEM,
CALHOUN SANDBAGGED ME.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.189
SHE'S PUTTING PAULA
ON THE STAND.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.024
- WHEN?
- IN TWO HOURS.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.960
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HER
AND THAT RELATIONSHIP?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.061
- WE DID OUR DUE DILIGENCE.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.528
- GOOD, TALK TO ME.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.368
- WHEN MY HUSBAND
SAYS HE LOVES ME,

31:42.401 --> 31:44.170
IT'S THE TRUTH.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.238
I WAS DRUNK THAT NIGHT.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.275
I WAS JEALOUS.
I WAS GOING AFTER HIM.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.377
HE PUT HIS HAND UP
TO STOP ME, AND I WENT DOWN.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.245
- IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY

31:53.279 --> 31:56.315
THAT YOUR HUSBAND
IS NOT ABUSIVE TOWARD YOU?

31:56.348 --> 31:58.350
- YES, 100%.

31:58.384 --> 32:02.254
- AND THAT NIGHT WAS A PRIVATE,
PERSONAL INTERACTION

32:02.288 --> 32:05.124
BETWEEN TWO PASSIONATE PEOPLE?

32:05.157 --> 32:06.492
- ABSOLUTELY.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.327
IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I'M
SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW

32:08.360 --> 32:11.263
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF A.J.,

32:11.297 --> 32:12.999
IT'S NOT TRUE.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.566
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.303
I DO.

32:17.336 --> 32:21.307
HE IS A GENTLE...

32:21.340 --> 32:23.742
GOOD MAN.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.445
HE DOESN'T DESERVE THIS.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.680
OUR FAMILY DOESN'T DESERVE THIS.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.316
- THANK YOU, MRS. MARTIN.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.356
- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,
MRS. MARTIN.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.391
THIS MUST BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

32:39.425 --> 32:40.392
- I'M FINE.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.228
- YES, ALWAYS, RIGHT?

32:42.261 --> 32:43.429
- EXCUSE ME?

32:43.462 --> 32:46.365
- EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS
GOOD AND FINE

32:46.398 --> 32:48.367
IN THE MARTIN HOUSE.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.137
- IT IS.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.305
- I'M NOT GONNA REPLAY
THAT VIDEO FOR YOU.

32:53.339 --> 32:56.442
I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE
SUFFERED THROUGH IT ENOUGH.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.476
- THANK YOU.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.378
- I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS

32:59.411 --> 33:01.280
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH A.J.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.348
- OKAY.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.351
- YOU MET HIM
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO

33:05.384 --> 33:07.353
WHEN YOU WERE 21?

33:07.386 --> 33:08.354
- YES.

33:08.387 --> 33:09.688
- AND HE WAS 35,

33:09.721 --> 33:12.524
TOWARD THE END
OF HIS PLAYING CAREER?

33:12.558 --> 33:13.592
AND IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAD NOT

33:13.625 --> 33:17.029
HAD ANY SIGNIFICANT
RELATIONSHIPS UP UNTIL THEN?

33:19.531 --> 33:23.102
- I MEAN, I'VE HAD BOYFRIENDS
IN THE PAST,

33:23.135 --> 33:24.803
BUT NOTHING THAT SERIOUS.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.405
- IT'S OKAY
TO ANSWER TRUTHFULLY.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.273
- YOUR HONOR.

33:27.306 --> 33:29.108
- GET TO IT, MR. BARBA.

33:29.141 --> 33:32.344
- IS A.J. YOUR FIRST
SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP?

33:32.378 --> 33:34.746
- HE'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.348
STILL IS.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.450
- IT MUST HAVE SEEMED
LIKE A FAIRY TALE.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.586
YOU MOVED IN WITH HIM
AFTER A FEW MONTHS,

33:40.619 --> 33:43.255
AND YOU HAD A.J. JUNIOR
A FEW YEARS LATER?

33:43.289 --> 33:44.390
- A FEW YEARS, YEAH.

33:44.423 --> 33:47.059
- YOU WERE A LIFESTYLE REPORTER
FOR THE LOCAL TV NEWS,

33:47.093 --> 33:49.628
BUT YOU GAVE THAT UP,
DIDN'T YOU?

33:49.661 --> 33:52.598
- I DID, WILLINGLY.

33:52.631 --> 33:57.069
- HOW MANY CLOSE FRIENDS
DO YOU HAVE, BESIDES A.J.?

33:57.103 --> 33:59.305
- I'M CLOSE TO MY SISTER,

33:59.338 --> 34:01.640
TO THE OTHER
RETIRED PLAYERS' WIVES.

34:01.673 --> 34:04.343
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WENT OUT WITH A MALE FRIEND

34:04.376 --> 34:06.645
OR YOUR GIRLFRIENDS
OR EVEN JUST YOUR SISTER

34:06.678 --> 34:09.781
WITHOUT A.J. BEING THERE?

34:09.815 --> 34:12.084
IS IT FAIR TO SAY

34:12.118 --> 34:16.322
YOUR LIFE REVOLVES
AROUND A.J. AND YOUR SON?

34:16.355 --> 34:17.523
- I'M PROUD OF THAT.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.325
I'M HAPPY.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.426
- EVEN WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
YELLS AT YOU?

34:20.459 --> 34:22.094
- HE DOESN'T YELL AT ME.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.495
- DOES HE YELL AT YOUR SON?

34:29.435 --> 34:30.569
- HE DOESN'T YELL.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.705
HE RAISES HIS VOICE,

34:33.739 --> 34:36.475
BECAUSE HE WANTS A.J.
TO LISTEN, TO BEHAVE,

34:36.508 --> 34:37.876
BECAUSE HE LOVES HIM.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.611
- THE WAY HE LOVES YOU?
- OBJECTION.

34:39.645 --> 34:40.479
- REPHRASE.

34:40.512 --> 34:44.316
WHEN A.J. RAISES HIS VOICE
AT JUNIOR,

34:44.350 --> 34:47.553
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

34:47.586 --> 34:49.721
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.790
- MRS. MARTIN...

34:51.823 --> 34:55.327
WHEN YOU SEE THE LOOK
ON YOUR SON'S FACE,

34:55.361 --> 34:58.397
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

34:58.430 --> 35:00.666
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ME,

35:00.699 --> 35:02.668
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR FAMILY.

35:02.701 --> 35:03.835
- I KNOW IT'S NOT HEALTHY

35:03.869 --> 35:05.371
TO STAY IN
AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.439
- DON'T YOU LECTURE ME.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.707
I'M NOT LEAVING HIM,

35:08.740 --> 35:10.542
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANY OF YOU HAVE TO SAY.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.644
- ANY OF US?

35:12.678 --> 35:15.514
HAVE YOU HEARD THIS
FROM YOUR SISTER MAYBE,

35:15.547 --> 35:16.715
OR OTHER GIRLFRIENDS?

35:16.748 --> 35:17.716
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE
LOST TOUCH WITH THEM?

35:17.749 --> 35:18.884
- NO, NO ONE'S SAID THAT.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.819
- DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU
JUST LOOKED AT YOUR HUSBAND

35:20.852 --> 35:22.721
BEFORE ANSWERING
THAT QUESTION, MRS. MARTIN?

35:22.754 --> 35:24.456
ARE YOU THAT WORRIED,
EVEN IN OPEN COURT,

35:24.490 --> 35:25.524
ABOUT HOW HE'LL REACT?

35:25.557 --> 35:26.592
- NO.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.593
- IS THAT WHY
YOU LIED REPEATEDLY

35:27.626 --> 35:29.395
TO THE POLICE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?

35:29.428 --> 35:30.762
WHY YOU KEEP INSISTING
THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT

35:30.796 --> 35:32.598
THAT HE KNOCKED YOU UNCONSCIOUS?

35:32.631 --> 35:35.267
DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.436
MRS. MARTIN...

35:37.469 --> 35:38.737
HE CAN'T ANSWER FOR YOU.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.339
YOU NEED TO ANSWER FOR YOURSELF.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.208
- I DON'T WANT TO LOSE HIM.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.778
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY FAMILY.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.580
WHY IS THAT WRONG?

35:50.716 --> 35:53.419
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT?

36:19.311 --> 36:19.478
.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.479
- I RARELY THINK THIS,
BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL SORRY

36:22.548 --> 36:24.816
FOR THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.353
THE INCREDIBLE PRESSURE
THEY'RE UNDER

36:27.386 --> 36:28.854
TO SHOW THEY'RE PROACTIVE,

36:28.887 --> 36:32.458
TO SHOW THEY'RE
POLITICALLY CORRECT.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.460
AND WHILE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
IS A SCOURGE

36:34.493 --> 36:36.995
THAT SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED,

36:37.028 --> 36:41.400
THIS CASE IS NOT THAT.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.702
THIS IS A CASE
OF A MISUNDERSTANDING

36:43.735 --> 36:46.372
BETWEEN TWO PASSIONATE PEOPLE.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.407
THIS IS A PRIVATE MATTER.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.710
THIS IS NOT A TEST CASE.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.912
PAULA MARTIN LOVES HER HUSBAND.

36:53.945 --> 36:57.816
SHE ABSOLUTELY DID NOT WANT
TO PRESS CHARGES.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.586
IF YOU CONVICT A.J. MARTIN,

37:00.619 --> 37:03.922
YOU WILL BE TEARING
A FAMILY APART.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.258
YOU WILL LEAVE PAULA MARTIN

37:06.292 --> 37:09.395
WITHOUT A LOVING,
SUPPORTIVE HUSBAND,

37:09.428 --> 37:14.466
LEAVE THEIR SON, A.J. JUNIOR,
WITHOUT A FATHER.

37:14.500 --> 37:19.271
IS THAT WHAT
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS FOR?

37:19.305 --> 37:23.442
TO DESTROY FAMILIES?

37:23.475 --> 37:26.778
I DON'T THINK SO.

37:26.812 --> 37:31.817
AND I DON'T BELIEVE
ANY OF YOU THINK SO EITHER.

37:42.794 --> 37:43.962
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

37:43.995 --> 37:46.532
THIS CASE AND YOUR DECISION
ARE IMPORTANT.

37:46.565 --> 37:47.633
WE SAW THE VIDEO.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.001
WE HEARD HIS EXCUSES,
HER DENIALS.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.338
YOU MAY BE ASKING,
"HOW IS IT ANY OF OUR BUSINESS

37:52.371 --> 37:54.940
"TO INTERFERE
IN ANOTHER COUPLE'S MARRIAGE?

37:54.973 --> 37:57.042
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT GOES ON
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS."

37:57.075 --> 37:59.478
NO, BUT WE DO KNOW--

37:59.511 --> 38:01.947
WE DO KNOW THAT,
AS A SOCIETY,

38:01.980 --> 38:06.418
WE HAVE EVOLVED BEYOND THE IDEA
THAT WOMEN ARE PROPERTY,

38:06.452 --> 38:09.388
THAT WHAT THEY FEEL,
WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE

38:09.421 --> 38:11.590
DOESN'T MATTER.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.392
AND BY HITTING PAULA,

38:13.425 --> 38:15.827
BY KNOCKING HER OUT,

38:15.861 --> 38:20.466
A.J. MARTIN IS SAYING
SHE DOESN'T MATTER.

38:20.499 --> 38:23.769
HE SHOWED GROSS DISREGARD
FOR HER SAFETY,

38:23.802 --> 38:25.737
FOR HER VERY LIFE.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.907
NOW, SHE HAS A CHILD WITH HIM.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.942
SHE LOVES HIM.

38:30.976 --> 38:34.045
CONVICTING HER HUSBAND
MAY NOT BE WHAT SHE WANTS.

38:34.079 --> 38:39.751
BUT TO NOT CONVICT HIM
IS PLAINLY AND SIMPLY WRONG.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.687
IT SENDS A MESSAGE

38:41.720 --> 38:45.457
THAT IT IS OKAY TO BE A BULLY
IN YOUR OWN HOME,

38:45.491 --> 38:47.826
TO CONTROL, TO INTIMIDATE,

38:47.859 --> 38:50.396
TO PHYSICALLY INJURE
YOUR SPOUSE.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.398
THIS IS NOT OKAY.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.132
WE MUST NOT STAND BY

38:54.165 --> 38:57.403
AND BY OUR SILENCE SAY
THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE

38:57.436 --> 39:00.071
TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.408
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE
AGAINST ANOTHER HUMAN BEING

39:02.441 --> 39:06.144
IS A CRIME...

39:06.177 --> 39:10.449
EVEN IF SHE IS JUST YOUR WIFE.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.670
- HEY.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.038
- HEY.

39:34.906 --> 39:37.476
- LIV, WHAT'S THE WORD
WITH BARBA?

39:37.509 --> 39:38.276
- BITING HIS NAILS,

39:38.309 --> 39:40.579
OR WHATEVER IT IS
THAT BARBA DOES.

39:40.612 --> 39:42.080
THE JURY'S NOW QUESTIONING

39:42.113 --> 39:44.049
WHETHER OR NOT
THE VIDEO WAS DOCTORED.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.617
- THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND
A REASON TO ACQUIT.

39:45.651 --> 39:46.818
THEY KNOW IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.154
- AND SENDING THE TWO
OF THEM HOME DOES?

39:49.187 --> 39:50.722
THAT BOY GROWING UP IN FEAR?

39:50.756 --> 39:53.492
- I JUST THINK
A.J.'S LEARNED HIS LESSON.

39:53.525 --> 39:54.560
- YOU DO?

39:56.528 --> 39:58.664
I DON'T.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.571
- HAS THE JURY
REACHED A VERDICT?

40:05.604 --> 40:07.473
- WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

40:07.506 --> 40:08.640
- WHAT SAY YOU?

40:08.674 --> 40:11.743
- ON THE CHARGE
OF RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT,

40:11.777 --> 40:14.112
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.014
[courtroom murmuring]

40:16.047 --> 40:17.483
- ANTWAN JARROD MARTIN,

40:17.516 --> 40:19.751
YOU ARE REMANDED TO RIKERS
PENDING SENTENCING.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.687
- BUT, YOUR HONOR--
- MEMBERS OF THE JURY,

40:21.720 --> 40:24.456
WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
[pounds gavel]

40:24.490 --> 40:25.457
- IT'S OKAY, A.J.

40:25.491 --> 40:26.492
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.726
- ANTWAN.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.160
- BUT YOU'LL NEED TO GO
WITH THE OFFICERS.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.462
- A.J.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.164
A.J.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.203
A.J.

40:46.244 --> 40:47.813
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S LOOKING AT?

40:47.846 --> 40:49.247
- HE'LL GET THE MINIMUM,
TWO YEARS.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.248
- SENDS A MESSAGE.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.818
[camera lenses clicking]

40:54.219 --> 40:55.521
- I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

40:55.554 --> 40:56.588
- PAULA, LET'S GO.

40:56.622 --> 40:57.623
- I LOST A HUSBAND.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.224
MY SON LOST HIS FATHER.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.026
- PAULA, YOU DESERVE
BETTER THAN THAT.

41:01.059 --> 41:01.893
SO DOES YOUR SON.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.695
- WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

41:03.729 --> 41:04.963
I WAS HAPPY.

41:04.996 --> 41:05.931
I WAS FINE.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.733
ME AND MY SON,
WE WERE JUST MAKING IT WORK.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.267
IT WAS MY CHOICE!

41:09.300 --> 41:10.769
AND YOU TOOK THAT AWAY.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.505
YOU THINK A.J.
WAS BEATING ME UP?

41:13.539 --> 41:15.507
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU DID?

41:27.719 --> 41:30.556
- WE DID THE RIGHT THING.

41:30.589 --> 41:31.723
- I KNOW.
