<i>Previously on Damages...</i>

00:02.843 --> 00:04.346
<i>I thought you
didn't believe in therapy.</i>

00:04.439 --> 00:05.820
<i>Yeah, well,
this is court-ordered.</i>

00:05.919 --> 00:07.117
<i>You might
as well talk to me.</i>

00:07.200 --> 00:08.528
<i>We need to discuss how you ended</i>

00:08.606 --> 00:11.061
<i>up here, and then I have to
sign off on your progress.</i>

00:11.179 --> 00:13.010
<i>Are you still taking care
of your granddaughter?</i>

00:13.105 --> 00:14.767
<i>Catherine's sick.
She has a fever.</i>

00:14.851 --> 00:17.542
<i>What's going on with this
wrongful death suit against High Star?</i>

00:17.647 --> 00:19.798
<i>Who else at High
Star knew about the program?</i>

00:19.874 --> 00:21.204
<i>I've withheld
nothing from you.</i>

00:21.262 --> 00:23.676
<i>Well, somehow,
there's a new witness in town.</i>

00:23.776 --> 00:25.023
<i>My name
is Nasim Marwat.</i>

00:25.124 --> 00:27.977
<i>On Chris's last mission,
three of his men were killed.</i>

00:28.139 --> 00:29.420
<i>Do you know the purpose
of that mission?</i>

00:29.526 --> 00:31.392
<i>Every mission,
they take someone away.</i>

00:31.463 --> 00:35.733
<i>Chris explained this to my father,
and now my father is dead.</i>

00:35.836 --> 00:37.914
<i>If High Star was
running some sort of terrorist</i>

00:37.975 --> 00:40.356
<i>extraction program, they
couldn't have done it alone.</i>

00:40.438 --> 00:42.735
<i>The other American from
Chris's mission-- I saw him.</i>

00:42.833 --> 00:43.985
<i>He was following me.</i>

00:44.090 --> 00:45.356
<i>I need to
get your testimony.</i>

00:45.439 --> 00:48.930
<i>Mr. Herndon can make
some inquiries about High Star.</i>

00:49.087 --> 00:51.156
<i>You were able to confirm
our witness's story.</i>

00:52.018 --> 00:55.970
<i>High Star was extracting
terrorist suspects for the CIA.</i>

you can take that, too.</i>

02:54.133 --> 02:55.653
<i>Sir, please
step out of the car.</i>

02:58.033 --> 02:59.598
<i>Stay right
where you are.</i>

03:02.729 --> 03:03.597
<i>It's okay, Ms.
Parsons.</i>

03:03.678 --> 03:05.085
<i>Ms. Hewes hired
security for you.</i>

03:05.796 --> 03:06.930
<i>You're gonna come with me.</i>

03:07.538 --> 03:08.386
<i>It's okay.
I know this man.</i>

03:08.464 --> 03:09.517
<i>He's with us.</i>

03:16.300 --> 03:17.306
<i>Let me just...</i>

03:17.855 --> 03:18.840
<i>Sir?</i>

03:20.187 --> 03:21.475
<i>Thank you for your trouble.</i>

03:23.300 --> 03:24.503
<i>No trouble at all.</i>

03:28.500 --> 03:31.575
<i>Ms. Parsons told me that
you were followed earlier today.</i>

03:31.667 --> 03:34.038
<i>Yes. The man from
Chris's mission is in New York.</i>

03:34.132 --> 03:37.624
<i>We are taking every
precaution to ensure your safety.</i>

03:37.712 --> 03:38.830
<i>Who is this man?</i>

03:38.948 --> 03:41.624
<i>We don't know, but
Detective Huntley will take your</i>

03:41.734 --> 03:44.599
<i>description of him, and
we'll try to find out.</i>

03:44.690 --> 03:46.756
<i>Yeah, I'd like to
move you to a secure location.</i>

03:46.853 --> 03:48.941
<i>We'll provide 24-hour
protection.</i>

03:49.139 --> 03:50.395
<i>I can't
stay here anymore.</i>

03:50.490 --> 03:52.259
<i>I would like to go
back to my country.</i>

03:52.400 --> 03:55.039
<i>Are you still willing
to give a statement, Mr. Marwat?</i>

03:56.730 --> 03:58.364
<i>If it can
be done quickly.</i>

03:58.451 --> 03:59.255
<i>Absolutely.</i>

03:59.340 --> 04:02.123
<i>We won't keep you in New York
any longer than necessary, and</i>

04:02.218 --> 04:04.791
<i>of course, this would
be a great help to us.</i>

04:07.653 --> 04:09.846
<i>Let's get you
some dinner and a bed.</i>

04:10.018 --> 04:11.165
<i>It'll
be safer this way.</i>

04:11.480 --> 04:12.632
<i>Thank you, Mr. Marwat.</i>

04:13.701 --> 04:16.309
<i>Thank you. We'll talk
in the morning. Thank you, Detective.</i>

04:21.778 --> 04:23.340
You've reached Howard T. Erickson.

04:23.449 --> 04:25.136
I'm not available to take your call.

04:25.247 --> 04:27.924
<i>Please leave a message and
have a blessed Christmas.</i>

04:29.204 --> 04:30.357
<i>Give me a call!</i>

04:30.602 --> 04:32.731
<i>Herndon was
able to get this for us.</i>

04:41.042 --> 04:44.041
<i>High Star was
conducting missions for the CIA?</i>

04:45.801 --> 04:48.485
<i>The operation
is called Dust Devil.</i>

04:48.648 --> 04:50.529
<i>When did
Herndon give this to you?</i>

04:50.660 --> 04:51.968
<i>Earlier tonight.</i>

04:52.410 --> 04:56.147
<i>He lied to me.
He told me he couldn't get anything.</i>

04:57.276 --> 05:00.614
<i>I... I think he just
wanted me to see it first.</i>

05:00.703 --> 05:02.473
<i>I think he's a little
worried about you.</i>

05:02.882 --> 05:05.024
<i>Thinks you may be
in over your head.</i>

05:05.418 --> 05:10.501
<i>Any information that you get,
I want to know about it... immediately.</i>

05:12.305 --> 05:14.216
<i>Ellen, I'm
showing it to you now.</i>

05:15.153 --> 05:17.239
<i>I couldn't call you on the
phone, because we have to</i>

05:17.330 --> 05:19.740
<i>assume that all communications
are compromised.</i>

05:21.050 --> 05:23.681
<i>Huntley's gonna sweep the
office for any bugs.</i>

05:23.783 --> 05:26.805
<i>We won't use our phones or
computers until we are</i>

05:26.916 --> 05:30.332
<i>absolutely sure that all lines
of communication are secure.</i>

05:34.740 --> 05:36.259
<i>"Dust Devil."</i>

05:38.881 --> 05:40.079
DD.

05:40.806 --> 05:43.589
"Dust Devil"-- That's what it says
on the back of Chris' medallion.

05:47.010 --> 05:50.055
Nasim must have witnessed
one of the Dust Devil missions.

05:50.379 --> 05:57.375
With his testimony and this document to
back him up, you've got yourself a case.

05:58.943 --> 06:02.767
I'm gonna begin
drafting a motion that compels

06:02.912 --> 06:07.075
High Star to deliver all of
their documents on Dust Devil.

06:07.214 --> 06:07.966
Good.

06:08.056 --> 06:10.026
Then we could start prepping
Marwat's deposition.

06:10.135 --> 06:12.183
What do you mean
there's another witness?

06:12.291 --> 06:13.506
It's news to me, too.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.624
I found out, I called
you immediately.

06:15.715 --> 06:17.154
I was carving our
Christmas bird.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.319
You said her entire case rested
on Chris Sanchez's testimony.

06:20.412 --> 06:21.226
It did.

06:21.305 --> 06:23.336
As far as I knew, we were
through that shit storm.

06:25.064 --> 06:28.363
It's possible Sanchez sent
somebody back from Afghanistan.

06:30.147 --> 06:31.361
How do you know?

06:32.081 --> 06:34.291
Through a CIA contact.

06:34.883 --> 06:35.838
A friend?

06:35.926 --> 06:38.430
I can't divulge my sources, Jack.
You know how that goes.

06:38.535 --> 06:41.044
How would a source in the
CIA know anything about this?

06:43.817 --> 06:45.337
I'm here to protect
this company.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.094
You have to tell me, Howard.

06:51.684 --> 06:53.537
It was a CIA program.

06:53.795 --> 06:55.282
- Dust Devil?
- That's right.

06:55.701 --> 06:57.118
Okay, when did it start?

06:57.216 --> 06:58.343
It's been a while now.

06:58.439 --> 07:00.498
I need anything and
everything that exists.

07:00.829 --> 07:04.909
Now listen, Jack, my
friend in the agency is the

07:05.004 --> 07:07.300
man that guarantees I get
my contracts renewed.

07:08.142 --> 07:11.025
I can't betray his
confidence in any manner.

07:11.127 --> 07:12.172
Of course not.

07:15.928 --> 07:17.066
Yeah, buddy.

07:17.158 --> 07:18.445
You keeping an eye
on your brothers?

07:19.252 --> 07:21.199
Yeah, go ahead and
start unwrapping them.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.855
I'm leaving right now.

07:23.829 --> 07:24.469
All right.

07:31.196 --> 07:33.705
It was a matter of
national security.

07:33.808 --> 07:37.406
Highly classified.
Up in the stratosphere classified.

07:37.508 --> 07:38.564
Understood.

07:38.660 --> 07:42.792
Get me all the paperwork on this thing--
E-mails, memos, whatever there is.

07:42.972 --> 07:46.413
If Ellen Parsons produces this
witness, I'll depose him, and

07:46.497 --> 07:48.498
we'll find out
everything he knows.

08:14.988 --> 08:16.287
Still don't feel well?

08:17.038 --> 08:17.948
Uh-uh.

08:20.775 --> 08:22.362
Oh.
Oh, you're burning up.

08:23.542 --> 08:26.979
Catherine's fever went away for a couple
of days, but, uh, it's come back.

08:28.079 --> 08:31.666
That is slightly unusual,
but there is a flu going around.

08:31.789 --> 08:35.087
She's abnormally tired.
She has no energy.

08:35.212 --> 08:36.900
Her check-up
seemed okay.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.464
I-I wouldn't get alarmed, but
I'll run some blood tests, and

08:39.549 --> 08:41.871
the nanny should make sure
that Catherine stays hydrated.

08:43.219 --> 08:45.304
I don't currently
have a nanny.

08:45.589 --> 08:49.629
Well, if you're interested, I
could recommend a private nursing service.

08:49.838 --> 08:53.558
There's a woman there who
specializes in pediatrics.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.224
She's wonderful with kids.

09:00.954 --> 09:02.027
Thank you.

09:02.156 --> 09:03.205
With the holiday and everything,

09:03.289 --> 09:05.150
I should get the
test results late tomorrow.

09:05.588 --> 09:06.698
I understand.

09:07.028 --> 09:10.926
There's nothing to worry
about, Patty. Kids get bugs all the time.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.557
It usually turns
out to be nothing.

09:52.702 --> 09:55.226
I'm looking for
something crude, like an

09:55.333 --> 10:00.001
explosive with an arming switch
that looks homemade or, uh, a

10:00.136 --> 10:01.912
cobbled-together pipe bomb.

10:02.007 --> 10:03.212
What sort of locale
are you thinking of?

10:03.300 --> 10:04.293
A bus.

10:04.413 --> 10:07.919
Could retrofit a device with a little
ignition generator. Nothing fancy.

10:08.008 --> 10:08.949
Exactly.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.528
Sounds like a rerun
of North Africa.

10:11.329 --> 10:12.724
Yeah.

10:12.801 --> 10:14.314
I was thinking the same thing.

10:16.027 --> 10:19.757
You ever see that
little tiki tiki girl?

10:22.259 --> 10:23.797
No?

10:25.129 --> 10:26.489
This is for you.

10:27.308 --> 10:30.004
Okay. I'm on it.
I'll have it to you tomorrow.

10:32.107 --> 10:34.487
Mr. Marwat, you
asserted previously that you

10:34.571 --> 10:39.022
recognized this medallion.
Yes or no, sir?

10:39.124 --> 10:40.696
You must state your reply.

10:41.733 --> 10:42.634
I'm sorry.

10:42.750 --> 10:43.341
It's okay.

10:43.408 --> 10:44.939
Everyone forgets when they're
nervous, but there will be a

10:45.068 --> 10:47.370
stenographer typing every word
you say for the record, so it's

10:47.447 --> 10:49.779
important that you
speak clearly.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.596
- Do you recognize it?
- Objection.

10:53.673 --> 10:55.563
Yes, I do.
Chris Sanchez wore it.

10:55.650 --> 10:57.253
Got to wait for
the full objection.

10:58.242 --> 11:02.703
- Sorry. - Objection. Previously
asked and answered. You may continue.

11:02.864 --> 11:04.436
Would you kindly
read what's on the back?

11:05.755 --> 11:06.877
"DD."

11:08.181 --> 11:09.840
Do you know what
those initials stand for?

11:10.661 --> 11:13.490
The DDs are what Chris and
his men used to call themselves.

11:14.034 --> 11:16.884
Have you ever heard
of Operation Dust Devil?

11:17.008 --> 11:18.178
No.

11:18.296 --> 11:20.730
So "DD" does not
stand for "Dust Devil"?

11:20.922 --> 11:22.178
No. I, uh...

11:22.246 --> 11:24.652
No, it does stand for
"Dust Devil," or no, it doesn't?

11:25.373 --> 11:26.567
I'm sorry. I...

11:26.651 --> 11:28.675
Mr. Marwat, to the
best of your knowledge, does

11:28.764 --> 11:31.698
"DD" stand for
Operation Dust Devil?"

11:31.802 --> 11:33.497
To the best of my
knowledge, no, but...

11:33.581 --> 11:36.068
So Chris Sanchez and his men had
nothing to do with Operation Dust Devil?

11:36.140 --> 11:36.958
I didn't say that.

11:37.036 --> 11:38.957
Okay, so,
let's stop here.

11:40.391 --> 11:43.024
This is a trap Mr. Erickson's
lawyers will set for you.

11:44.635 --> 11:49.277
If they ask if "DD" stands for "Operation
Dust Devil," just say, "I don't know."

11:50.542 --> 11:53.149
This lawyer represents
the company that may have

11:53.234 --> 11:57.092
murdered your father, so he will do
whatever he can to try to confuse you.

11:59.253 --> 12:06.503
It is very important that you take your
time, and you don't let anyone rush you.

12:06.773 --> 12:11.840
Yes. Okay.
Please, let's keep practicing.

12:25.745 --> 12:30.157
Catherine?
Can you say hello to Ms. Auroro?

12:30.589 --> 12:33.015
Hi, Catherine. Hi.

12:33.117 --> 12:36.116
Oh, can I meet your friend?
What's her name?

12:37.058 --> 12:38.494
Blueberry.

12:38.745 --> 12:43.149
Well, I can tell Blueberry watches
over you and protects you, right?

12:43.260 --> 12:44.146
Hmm?

12:45.594 --> 12:49.214
Ms. Auroro is going to stay with
you today when I go to work, okay?

12:50.529 --> 12:55.571
Okay, Catherine, you close your
eyes, and I'll be sitting right over there.

12:55.719 --> 12:58.875
I'll see you when you wake up.
There you go.

13:00.543 --> 13:01.938
Oh, what a beautiful girl.

13:02.031 --> 13:05.518
Oh, thank you.
I'm so grateful you were available.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.362
Oh, happy to help, Ms. Hewes.

13:09.025 --> 13:10.948
God bless you, child.

13:16.299 --> 13:18.778
Parsons has requested
every High Star document that

13:18.863 --> 13:20.901
references Operation
Dust Devil.

13:22.318 --> 13:24.660
What happens if
we don't fork 'em over?

13:24.754 --> 13:26.347
It's part of the
discovery process.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.471
They file a subpoena,
the judge enforces it.

13:28.562 --> 13:31.990
- I'm not optimistic about our grounds
for a challenge. - I see.

13:32.442 --> 13:33.911
And they've put their
witness on the list.

13:33.986 --> 13:36.582
He needs to leave the country, so
they're expediting his deposition.

13:37.836 --> 13:42.561
My team's done an extensive review of all
the company records Parsons has requested.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.177
We cannot let Parsons
get these documents.

13:45.224 --> 13:48.750
So we'll just have to find another
way to cut the balls off this thing.

13:51.186 --> 13:53.917
I'll talk to my guy
at the Agency.

13:54.781 --> 13:58.171
But be careful.
The CIA may be on your side now,

13:58.283 --> 14:01.709
but they'll throw you under a bus to
cover their ass if they want to.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.600
I know how the
game is played, Jack.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.449
That's a good
girl, Catherine.

14:08.396 --> 14:11.467
I'm going to take it out of
your ear, and you are all done.

14:12.170 --> 14:12.842
Huh?

14:14.014 --> 14:20.432
Okay, let's tuck you in.
Tuck you in and get you all cozy.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.518
All right.

14:24.140 --> 14:28.095
Now I lay me down to sleep, I
pray the Lord my soul to keep.

14:28.221 --> 14:33.696
See me safely through the night, and
wake me with the morning light. Amen.

14:41.890 --> 14:43.302
Would you like
anything to drink?

14:43.377 --> 14:45.080
No, thank you.
I should get home.

14:45.395 --> 14:47.413
I'll be back first thing.
6:00 a.m. is okay?

14:47.487 --> 14:48.853
Yes, thank you.

14:50.228 --> 14:53.537
And, uh, I'd appreciate it if you
wouldn't pray with Catherine.

14:54.271 --> 14:56.048
We were just saying
a good night prayer.

14:56.177 --> 14:58.851
I understand.
I'm not making any judgments.

15:00.198 --> 15:03.753
But I'd prefer that Catherine
not be exposed to it.

15:05.304 --> 15:08.099
I have my faith.
It's very important to me.

15:09.528 --> 15:13.744
I respect that.
And I hope you'll respect my wishes.

15:15.192 --> 15:19.238
Certainly.
Were you raised in any faith?

15:21.315 --> 15:23.579
Catholic.
I was raised Catholic.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.611
Were you baptized?

15:29.166 --> 15:30.632
I must have been.

15:32.234 --> 15:34.768
But Catherine
definitely wasn't baptized?

15:34.872 --> 15:36.319
No.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.926
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:47.394 --> 15:49.359
Why can't you just
kick this up to your boss?

15:50.290 --> 15:52.273
Have him seal the
Dust Devil documents.

15:52.607 --> 15:54.911
Classified and confidential.
End of problem.

15:55.024 --> 15:57.562
We can't get
the Agency involved.

15:57.675 --> 16:00.174
How the fuck did you let
this guy slip through the cracks?

16:00.280 --> 16:04.415
A little less volume, please.
I'm working on a flu here.

16:04.499 --> 16:05.761
You were
responsible for knowing

16:05.839 --> 16:08.365
everything that happened
on the ground over there.

16:08.450 --> 16:10.449
Don't worry
about the deposition.

16:10.530 --> 16:13.865
Why not?! They have a witness,
and we cannot let him be deposed.

16:14.023 --> 16:15.535
I'm taking care of it.

16:16.054 --> 16:20.214
I promise you, Parsons will not
get this witness on the record.

16:25.233 --> 16:29.132
- Is that what I asked for?
- Yeah.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.445
Those are the only copies.
What are you going to do with them?

16:33.891 --> 16:36.728
- Protect my company.
- How?

16:37.014 --> 16:39.922
Have a friend from the
Department of Defense take a look.

16:40.676 --> 16:42.488
He won't
want to see that.

16:42.696 --> 16:45.250
Which is exactly why
I'm going to show it to him.

16:45.391 --> 16:47.717
I like it, Howard.

16:47.881 --> 16:52.181
Good. Suck a lozenge.
And stop this deposition.

16:58.553 --> 17:00.217
Patty, I
heard from the lab.

17:00.324 --> 17:02.068
What did they find?

17:02.162 --> 17:03.795
Nothing definitive yet.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.667
What are the
possibilities?

17:05.816 --> 17:08.493
I prefer to
speak to you in person.

17:08.590 --> 17:10.127
Can you meet me at my office?

17:10.387 --> 17:13.027
Sure. I'll be right over.

17:14.345 --> 17:18.054
Have you taken Catherine to
California or anywhere in the Southwest?

17:18.143 --> 17:19.980
No.
We haven't left New York.

17:20.085 --> 17:22.109
What about your beach house?
Have you taken her there?

17:22.239 --> 17:25.685
No.
Not since last summer. Why?

17:26.078 --> 17:27.281
Lyme disease.

17:27.368 --> 17:30.261
But this would be an unusually
long time for it to present.

17:30.363 --> 17:33.769
So if it's
not that, what?

17:34.008 --> 17:35.745
It could be
as simple as mono.

17:35.846 --> 17:36.910
For a child?

17:37.005 --> 17:39.751
You mentioned Catherine's
been to your office regularly?

17:39.834 --> 17:42.484
She's spent a fair amount
of time around adults?

17:42.581 --> 17:44.723
Isn't there a very
quick test for mono?

17:44.810 --> 17:46.598
No.
Children under four don't

17:46.683 --> 17:51.003
produce the heterophile antibody,
so the test you're referring to

17:51.084 --> 17:54.925
will always return with a negative
result even if the child's infected.

17:56.208 --> 18:00.333
The only way to rule out mono
is to check her liver enzymes.

18:00.434 --> 18:02.028
So I have to
wait for another test?

18:02.872 --> 18:04.620
I'm afraid so, Patty.

18:07.048 --> 18:10.323
Very simple. Black powder,
throw in some nails, roof tacks.

18:10.411 --> 18:12.238
Everything fits in the bag.

18:12.901 --> 18:14.433
It detonates
with a cell phone?

18:14.518 --> 18:16.557
No need.
You said it was better low-tech, right?

18:16.679 --> 18:18.852
Yeah...

18:19.662 --> 18:21.934
This beaut will
work, no questions asked.

18:22.041 --> 18:27.050
Most important, set the timer to ten minutes,
turn off the kill switch and it's armed.

18:27.155 --> 18:30.121
Stash the bag, and get
your ass out of there.

18:31.539 --> 18:33.818
It won't work if the kill
switch is still engaged.

18:33.912 --> 18:34.880
Copy that.

18:56.171 --> 18:57.392
What?

18:58.769 --> 19:00.515
I didn't say a word.

19:01.360 --> 19:06.632
Your worry takes up all the air.
And it's making you sick.

19:07.398 --> 19:11.447
No, no, there's a--
There's a flu going around.

19:13.967 --> 19:18.904
And now you give it to me?
You should have told me first.

19:19.061 --> 19:20.377
I'm sorry.

19:25.295 --> 19:26.776
I fucked up.

19:28.161 --> 19:33.708
I, uh, I miscalculated the
risk on an operation.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.569
I didn't have all the intel.

19:38.101 --> 19:39.687
What did it cost?

19:40.871 --> 19:42.647
Cost in terms of what?

19:42.753 --> 19:44.391
Lives.

19:45.676 --> 19:47.757
I'm not sure yet.

19:49.965 --> 19:58.519
Okay. So, fix it or
move on, but don't brood.

20:00.778 --> 20:02.654
You're burning up.

20:04.422 --> 20:07.207
Why didn't you tell
me you'd come to New York?

20:08.108 --> 20:10.696
If I hadn't seen you,
we'd have missed each other.

20:11.572 --> 20:13.931
It was a
last-minute assignment.

20:14.966 --> 20:20.462
You know my agency.
We make it up as we go along.

20:24.896 --> 20:28.254
When did you let
your hair get like this?

20:30.097 --> 20:32.475
Does that
mean you like it?

20:32.714 --> 20:37.233
No.

20:40.798 --> 20:44.736
How come you never
settled down, started a family?

20:45.372 --> 20:48.752
The life I lead?
What's the point?

20:49.072 --> 20:50.919
You're getting old.

20:58.251 --> 20:59.814
The mess I made--

21:03.582 --> 21:09.880
To fix it I'm going to have
to do things I'd rather not.

21:19.259 --> 21:20.686
14th Street.

21:24.911 --> 21:27.321
The bus will now be making
express stops only.

21:27.925 --> 21:29.811
Running express only from 14th.

22:48.820 --> 22:49.789
Go.

22:55.188 --> 22:56.617
I need to speak
to your lieutenant.

22:56.704 --> 22:58.437
Everyone's going to be
interviewed in a while, ma'am.

22:58.515 --> 22:59.949
No, not
in a while, now.

23:00.057 --> 23:01.782
I think I might have
been the target.

23:03.170 --> 23:06.616
Ma'am, there was 28 other
passengers riding that bus.

23:06.708 --> 23:10.148
Typically an act like this doesn't
target one specific person.

23:10.243 --> 23:11.069
I understand.

23:11.143 --> 23:14.064
What's atypical here is the nature
of the case I'm involved in.

23:14.288 --> 23:18.946
In my opinion, Agent Roseti, this
could have been a threat against the firm.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.808
Detective Huntley is
handling our private security.

23:21.927 --> 23:25.194
- You're NYPD?
- Retired, yes.

23:26.885 --> 23:28.533
Hmm.
Anyway, why don't you

23:28.622 --> 23:30.524
bring me up to speed on
the relevant details?

23:32.358 --> 23:34.012
Excuse me one moment.

23:43.415 --> 23:44.528
Yes?

23:44.969 --> 23:48.015
I wanted you to know
I got the test results back.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.604
And?

23:50.486 --> 23:53.531
I'm sorry, we
still don't have clarity.

23:53.753 --> 23:55.250
What do you mean?

23:55.395 --> 23:58.333
I'm not happy
with what I'm seeing.

23:58.456 --> 24:00.712
I recommend ordering
another round of tests.

24:00.836 --> 24:02.535
So Catherine
doesn't have mono?

24:02.633 --> 24:04.832
No. She doesn't.

24:04.942 --> 24:06.442
What's the
worst case scenario?

24:08.783 --> 24:11.971
Leukemia, but we
won't know anything for certain

24:12.054 --> 24:13.684
until the additional tests come back.

24:16.328 --> 24:18.943
It can present in
several different ways.

24:19.157 --> 24:20.571
What are the odds?

24:22.570 --> 24:24.212
I prefer not
to think that way.

24:24.302 --> 24:27.472
What are the odds
that Catherine has leukemia?

24:28.487 --> 24:33.387
Based on what I'm seeing, the
literature says there's a 2.8% chance.

24:34.284 --> 24:38.500
Roughly one in 36 who present
this way are positive.

24:42.092 --> 24:43.579
Patty, are you there?

24:46.828 --> 24:48.076
Yeah.

24:48.261 --> 24:52.658
- I'll call you as soon as I
know anything. - All right.

24:57.417 --> 24:59.663
Anything you want
to share about the waiting?

25:00.109 --> 25:03.614
Will sharing get me Catherine's
test results any faster?

25:05.725 --> 25:08.035
When you're feeling
uncertain about things like this,

25:08.234 --> 25:13.840
do you tend to think the outcome
will be positive or negative?

25:19.273 --> 25:20.478
No answer?

25:21.280 --> 25:23.235
It depends
on the situation.

25:23.493 --> 25:25.834
The situation we're
talking about is Catherine.

25:27.513 --> 25:29.070
Do you fear the worst?

25:29.277 --> 25:33.069
Of course I do.
I mean, wouldn't you?

25:33.426 --> 25:34.726
You're angry.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.805
It was a stupid question.

25:37.328 --> 25:40.229
Anger often
covers up other feelings.

25:42.565 --> 25:47.377
Fear, sadness, hurt.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.827
You're here because of
your anger issues, Patty.

25:55.241 --> 26:01.349
Can you at least acknowledge that you
have a rather large capacity for anger?

26:01.676 --> 26:04.629
When I'm asked a
stupid question, yes.

26:05.096 --> 26:06.408
I'm sorry.

26:11.680 --> 26:15.560
Catherine's nurse
asked if she was baptized.

26:16.037 --> 26:18.720
- Was she?
- I'm not religious.

26:19.497 --> 26:22.613
- So she wasn't.
- No.

26:23.245 --> 26:26.674
Often people turn to
religion in times like this.

26:29.499 --> 26:33.266
It would make sense if waiting for the
test results made you feel helpless.

26:33.930 --> 26:37.890
And often when people feel helpless, it's
common for them to turn to religion.

26:38.248 --> 26:40.661
Are you suggesting
religion for me?

26:40.991 --> 26:42.465
I didn't bring it up.

26:43.241 --> 26:46.207
You're the one who talked about
your granddaughter's baptism.

26:52.980 --> 26:57.051
Do you wish you could
turn to religion now?

27:01.499 --> 27:04.112
My mother was religious
because she was weak.

27:04.337 --> 27:09.106
That's interesting.
Why do you think she was weak?

27:09.247 --> 27:11.067
She couldn't
stand up to my father.

27:12.758 --> 27:14.552
So she felt helpless.

27:16.200 --> 27:21.687
She did nothing to help herself.
There's a difference.

27:21.826 --> 27:27.091
Maybe that's why she
found religion. To help herself.

27:27.894 --> 27:29.914
It was pathetic.

27:31.639 --> 27:39.891
I think, um, religion for her was like a...
insurance policy.

27:43.635 --> 27:45.853
I have a civil
suit pending against me.

27:46.705 --> 27:49.399
I'm being asked to turn
over High Star's records.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.176
You sure you don't want something?
They make a great Caesar.

27:52.653 --> 27:54.987
No. I need your help.

27:55.609 --> 27:59.274
I can't turn over my company's
records, Trent. Neither can you.

27:59.633 --> 28:01.891
Why? What's it got to do
with the Defense Department?

28:02.211 --> 28:04.352
It'll compromise
national security.

28:09.168 --> 28:11.953
I can't interfere with
a civil case, all right?

28:12.248 --> 28:15.093
You know how I stick my beak out
for you when I can, but you're

28:15.162 --> 28:17.172
getting too much attention
right now, Howard.

28:21.142 --> 28:23.290
You should probably
take a look at this.

28:37.839 --> 28:40.514
The Defense Department's
okay with that going public?

28:40.622 --> 28:41.895
You weren't doing
this on your own?

28:41.979 --> 28:43.946
Of course not.
I was helping out the Agency.

28:44.035 --> 28:46.593
We kept D.O.D.
out of it for obvious reasons.

28:46.706 --> 28:50.476
But believe me, you guys
benefitted from the intelligence.

28:50.570 --> 28:52.947
I can't even count how many
different ways this is illegal.

28:53.051 --> 28:54.807
Trent, if this
lawsuit goes forward, it not

28:54.889 --> 28:58.209
only gives me a black eye, but
it'll blow back on the military

28:58.281 --> 29:01.267
and you guys will wind up with
another Abu Ghraib on your hands.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.898
Help yourself by helping me.

29:53.477 --> 29:55.823
I think Nasim is ready
for the deposition tomorrow.

29:57.232 --> 29:59.339
Opposing counsel is Jack Shaw.

29:59.962 --> 30:00.861
Hmm.

30:01.252 --> 30:04.832
Hired by Ashcroft to work for the
D.O.J. during the Bush administration.

30:05.010 --> 30:09.123
Yeah. He and Erickson
share the same politics.

30:09.719 --> 30:11.406
Have you ever
gone up against Shaw?

30:11.773 --> 30:13.980
We appeared on a
panel together once.

30:14.415 --> 30:22.771
He's smart, measured, doesn't
shoot off his mouth.

30:25.759 --> 30:29.197
How's Catherine?
The doctors made any progress?

30:29.307 --> 30:34.972
No.
One test just leads to another.

30:36.742 --> 30:42.220
There's a one in 36 chance
that she has leukemia.

30:44.195 --> 30:47.879
If it's not that, it's
another flu, or...

30:49.541 --> 30:54.807
Jesus, one in 36.
That's... kind of scary.

30:57.444 --> 31:01.016
I grew up with a guy whose younger
brother had some type of leukemia.

31:01.956 --> 31:07.360
He was diagnosed age five.
And he was fine, he made a full recovery.

31:12.864 --> 31:14.001
Happy holidays.

31:14.167 --> 31:17.971
It's done, Howard.
The documents have been taken care of.

31:44.542 --> 31:45.823
Shit.

31:51.692 --> 31:52.881
Shit.

31:53.217 --> 31:54.582
This is bullshit.

31:57.533 --> 31:58.752
Hello?

31:58.894 --> 32:00.291
Patty, we can't use any of this.

32:00.547 --> 32:03.735
By order of the Defense Department,
it's all been redacted.

32:03.914 --> 32:07.148
It's okay.
We still have the deposition.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.712
The bomb had enough
juice to take out everyone on the bus,

32:38.807 --> 32:41.711
but it didn't detonate because the
kill switch was still engaged.

32:41.814 --> 32:44.858
Well, thanks for keeping
me apprised, Agent Roseti.

32:45.373 --> 32:46.505
The guy screwed up.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.767
We were able to find a strand of hair,
and we're analyzing it for DNA.

32:50.033 --> 32:50.955
How's it going in here?

32:51.045 --> 32:52.817
I think we've got enough;
it's a good sample.

32:52.959 --> 32:54.266
What's our E.T.A.?

32:54.364 --> 32:57.580
We should be able to run this guy's
DNA through the database in an hour.

33:31.957 --> 33:33.528
What the hell
is going on, Jerry?

33:33.647 --> 33:35.808
My lawyer just left for
Patty Hewes' office.

33:35.903 --> 33:37.610
The deposition's going forward.

33:37.702 --> 33:40.360
I did my job.
What the fuck are you doing?!

33:46.512 --> 33:48.930
So, we'll, uh, sit together
on this side of the table.

33:49.185 --> 33:50.980
This woman will
record all that I say?

33:51.094 --> 33:52.710
Yes.
And it's going to take several hours

33:52.791 --> 33:57.022
so if you get uncomfortable or you need
a minute, just let either of us know.

33:57.415 --> 33:58.821
- Good afternoon.
- Jack.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.576
Pleasure to see
you again, Patty.

34:00.719 --> 34:04.841
Ms. Parsons. Mr. Marwat,
nice to meet you.

34:05.448 --> 34:07.366
I'm Jack Shaw, opposing counsel.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.518
- It's okay.
- Hello.

34:13.371 --> 34:15.782
Okay, let's
have a seat, shall we?

34:17.293 --> 34:19.233
Listen up. We got lucky.

34:19.331 --> 34:21.188
We found the suspect
in the database.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.301
We have a name,
address and profile.

34:23.391 --> 34:26.301
The suspect is to be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.197
Thank you very much for
appearing here today, Mr. Marwat.

34:40.458 --> 34:43.761
I'd like to begin by asking you
if you are familiar with any

34:43.866 --> 34:46.413
employee of the High Star
Security Corporation.

34:46.598 --> 34:47.561
Yes.

34:47.712 --> 34:50.443
And what is the name of the
employee that you allegedly know?

34:51.313 --> 34:53.016
Christopher Sanchez.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.749
How would you describe your
relationship with Mr. Sanchez?

35:14.817 --> 35:16.176
Chris is my friend.

35:16.285 --> 35:18.053
I see. So your friend
worked for the company?

35:30.464 --> 35:33.086
Mr. Marwat, you stated
that you provided area maps for

35:33.179 --> 35:35.271
a High Star employee.
Is that correct?

35:35.370 --> 35:36.284
Yes.

35:36.367 --> 35:38.134
Do you know what
those maps were used for?

35:39.722 --> 35:42.656
To locate men suspected
of terrorist activities.

35:43.461 --> 35:44.835
Okay, let's go.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.396
What?

36:03.082 --> 36:06.167
What do you believe a
High Star employee would do if

36:06.281 --> 36:08.755
he located the type of man
that you're referring to?

36:09.448 --> 36:12.257
High Star employees would
remove these men for questioning.

36:19.794 --> 36:22.173
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but you're going to have to stop.

36:22.272 --> 36:23.032
What's wrong?

36:23.170 --> 36:25.683
What
took you so long?

36:25.797 --> 36:27.279
I stopped
for a massage.

36:27.381 --> 36:29.277
FBI.
Nasim Marwat, you're under arrest.

36:30.497 --> 36:31.660
What are the charges?

36:31.755 --> 36:33.432
Conspiracy to
commit a terrorist act.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.684
I've done no such thing.

36:34.764 --> 36:36.175
When?!
He's been in protective custody.

36:36.263 --> 36:37.335
This is not possible.

36:37.417 --> 36:38.430
What the hell is going...?

36:38.501 --> 36:40.984
He's not even in the system.
Sir, excuse me.

36:42.251 --> 36:44.295
I hacked into the
fed database, no problem.

36:44.557 --> 36:45.553
Good.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.643
I was able to get
your terrorist into the system.

36:48.450 --> 36:50.572
Didn't know if you,
uh, needed this back.

36:50.692 --> 36:52.804
Ah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:55.334 --> 36:56.579
How'd you
get that anyway?

36:57.784 --> 36:59.935
After he checked
out of his hotel.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.511
Sir, thank
you for your trouble.

37:03.558 --> 37:04.984
No trouble at all.

37:06.221 --> 37:09.848
I went into his room, found
some hair in the wastebasket.

37:10.207 --> 37:13.294
He must have shaved his beard
after he came to the States.

37:14.930 --> 37:17.315
I imagine he wanted to blend in.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.278
One in 36.

40:35.577 --> 40:36.734
Keep moving.
