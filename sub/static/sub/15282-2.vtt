00:01.330 --> 00:03.290
Previously on criminal minds...

00:03.300 --> 00:05.260
he came after me. He came to my home.

00:05.270 --> 00:07.780
Sarah's dead. He butchered her.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.850
Your team is in trouble.

00:09.860 --> 00:15.470
Did you fly a disturbed college student to meet
with a man you believed to be a serial killer?

00:15.480 --> 00:16.580
It was my decision.

00:16.590 --> 00:17.570
Give me your badge.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.440
You're suspended for 2 weeks
pending an investigation.

00:20.450 --> 00:23.390
There's no satisfactory
explanation what I've done.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.110
I just don't understand
it any of it anymore.

01:28.210 --> 01:29.550
reid?

01:31.730 --> 01:33.470
What are you doing here?

01:39.050 --> 01:40.600
Gideon didn't answer his phone.

01:40.610 --> 01:41.900
I called him twice.

01:41.910 --> 01:43.620
Have you been here all night?

01:43.630 --> 01:45.710
We were supposed to play chess.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.740
Here?

01:47.940 --> 01:51.110
Uh,he hasn't been back to
his apartment since,um...

01:51.880 --> 01:53.220
right.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.160
I need to brief the team,so...

01:56.170 --> 01:57.520
is hotch here?

01:57.530 --> 02:00.500
Uh,he's not due for a half hour.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.650
- Thanks,honey.
- Yeah.

02:05.050 --> 02:06.340
Are you sure you're ok?

02:06.350 --> 02:07.980
Yeah,I'm fine.

02:10.740 --> 02:12.960
You're doing the right thing.

02:12.970 --> 02:14.210
I know.

02:15.560 --> 02:19.200
Getting suspended was
a blessing in disguise.

02:19.210 --> 02:22.030
We deserve a normal life.

02:27.030 --> 02:29.610
- I love you.
- I love you,too.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.310
What,no hotch,now no gideon?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.650
No,not yet.

02:35.660 --> 02:36.880
These guys have been out 2 weeks.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.010
You'd think the least they
could do is be on time.

02:39.020 --> 02:41.330
Yeah,'cause you're never late.

02:41.670 --> 02:42.820
So where's prentiss?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.160
Her phone keeps going
straight to voicemail.

02:45.170 --> 02:47.530
Well,this room just keeps getting
smaller and smaller,doesn't it?

02:47.540 --> 02:48.920
Should we wait 15 minutes?

02:49.320 --> 02:50.490
We can just brief them on the plane.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.610
Right now the police taskforce
in milwaukee needs our help.

02:53.620 --> 02:59.190
They've had 4 murders over the past 3 weeks,and in
addition,another woman has been missing the last 2 days.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.610
They've all the women are in
their 30s,married with children.

03:01.620 --> 03:02.980
Any connection between these victims?

03:02.990 --> 03:06.040
Just that they've all been
abducted from the area of wauwatosa,

03:06.050 --> 03:09.800
all from very public
places,but there's no witnesses.

03:09.810 --> 03:12.500
How are we even certain
it's the same killer?

03:12.510 --> 03:14.410
Well,for starters...

03:14.420 --> 03:17.560
all of the bodies have been
dumped in the city's third ward.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.750
And there's this.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.420
Is that what I think it is?

03:25.430 --> 03:28.030
All the hearts have been
cut from their bodies.

George washington said,let your heart feel
for the affliction and distress of everyone.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.300
Hey,am I glad to see you.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.160
Where you headed?

04:26.170 --> 04:28.370
Milwaukee. Looks like another one.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.700
I'll catch you up on the flight.

04:29.710 --> 04:31.470
I'm meeting with the section chief.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.700
Ok,so I'll wait.

04:32.710 --> 04:33.970
I'm just glad you're back.

04:33.980 --> 04:36.920
Trust me when I tell you things have
been a little bit shaky around here.

04:36.930 --> 04:39.170
Morgan,I'm requesting a transfer.

04:39.180 --> 04:40.130
Is that a joke?

04:40.140 --> 04:41.390
No,it's not a joke.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.420
Strauss has suspended me once
already. The writing's on the wall.

04:44.430 --> 04:47.220
Hotch,we both know that
suspension was bogus.

04:47.230 --> 04:48.490
You'll get a new unit chief.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.710
What if we don't want a new unit chief?

04:50.720 --> 04:53.500
Well,maybe the next one won't
be such a drill sergeant.

04:53.990 --> 04:56.770
Look,man,are you a
pain in my ass? Yes,sir.

04:56.780 --> 05:00.870
But wanting to hang out with you and needing you
to lead this team are two very different things.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.110
It's been a privilege.

05:10.170 --> 05:12.530
I was hoping you'd do the right thing.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.720
Have you given any thought to
what department you'll request?

05:15.730 --> 05:19.150
I was under the impression that if I left
the B.A.U. I'd have my choice of posts.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.710
Well,I'll consider it after I
fully complete my investigation.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.400
You were a prosecutor.

05:24.410 --> 05:27.640
What about heading up a
white collar crime taskforce?

05:27.650 --> 05:31.220
That'll get you home at
nights at a reasonable hour.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.640
Sorry to interrupt.

05:33.650 --> 05:37.690
Sir,I've decided to resign from
the fbi,effective immediately.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.330
I don't understand.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.470
I'm taking a foreign service exam.

05:41.480 --> 05:45.450
With my connections,I stand a good
chance of landing in the state department.

05:45.460 --> 05:47.040
Prentiss,I think that's a mistake.

05:47.050 --> 05:49.120
Well,don't try to talk me out of it.

05:49.130 --> 05:52.410
Garcia saw my name on the
list and she already tried.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.370
If she can't talk someone out
of doing something,no one can.

05:58.260 --> 06:00.470
Sorry for the interruption.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.970
But,sir,it's good to see you back.

06:05.590 --> 06:09.360
The team needs you. Ma'am.

06:10.380 --> 06:13.990
I'll be overseeing this case
until I can assign a replacement.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.580
You don't have any field experience.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.610
My job is to protect the bureau.

06:19.620 --> 06:23.210
If I have to hold the team's
hand for one case,so be it.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.630
Ma'am,in order to function
effectively,this team needs stability.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.960
The B.A.U. Has some very talented
people and they're bureau assets.

06:30.970 --> 06:35.580
And I believe it's time that they were
out from underneath you and jason gideon.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.940
You know,from this
angle,she almost looks human.

06:48.270 --> 06:50.210
Has anyone talked to emily yet?

06:50.220 --> 06:53.000
She was gone before I heard the news.

06:53.270 --> 06:55.430
I told you,reid,now we're down
2 agents and gideon's M.I.A.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.070
Doesn't strauss
ever do any--

06:58.530 --> 06:59.590
correct me if I'm wrong,

06:59.600 --> 07:03.920
but I believe it's protocol to brief
everyone before we arrive at the crime scene.

07:03.930 --> 07:05.500
Yes,ma'am.

07:06.490 --> 07:11.450
This unsub is abducting women from
very public places,with no witnesses.

07:11.460 --> 07:14.770
He holds them 48 hours,with
no sexual assault,

07:14.780 --> 07:19.140
and then he dumps their bodies with
their hearts carved out of their chests.

07:22.790 --> 07:26.470
There's an obvious dichotomy in the skill
the unsub exhibits in abducting these women

07:26.480 --> 07:29.900
and the fact that he cuts
their hearts out so crudely.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.960
We're probably looking at
someone in a psychotic break.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.980
Could be a butcher. Might be a hunter.

07:35.990 --> 07:39.160
Somebody who's very comfortable
being around blood,but as you can see,

07:39.170 --> 07:41.710
he obviously doesn't have
the skills of a surgeon.

07:43.010 --> 07:45.400
So do we have a working theory?

07:47.560 --> 07:48.940
Sure we do.

07:48.950 --> 07:51.370
Somebody really doesn't like women.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.960
Is it appropriate to ask whether
I could talk you out of it?

08:11.040 --> 08:12.830
Heard you got a bigger office.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.170
A swanky new map and everything.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.600
It's the milwaukee file.

08:18.610 --> 08:20.100
J.J.Wanted me to give it to you.

08:20.110 --> 08:21.090
I'm not working it.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.020
I'm just following orders.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.020
They found a new body this morning.

08:25.030 --> 08:27.360
The others are headed
straight to the scene.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.679
You the fbi?

08:42.690 --> 08:44.039
Derek morgan.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.650
Spencer reid,jennifer
jareau,and section chief strauss.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.420
Vic wolynski,milwaukee pd.

08:49.430 --> 08:51.260
You worked the jeffrey dahmer case.

08:51.270 --> 08:53.790
16 years ago.I've studied it.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.110
And you remember my name?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.250
He remembers everything.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.190
'S it what he does.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.770
What can you tell us?

08:58.780 --> 09:02.100
Uh,local merchant noticed
her a few hours ago.

09:02.110 --> 09:05.070
Uh,but considering he didn't see
her when he first came to work,uh,

09:05.080 --> 09:08.850
we figure she was dumped
there between 7:50 and 8:05.

09:08.860 --> 09:10.420
Same window as the others.

09:10.430 --> 09:12.080
All the bodies were
found in this area,right?

09:12.090 --> 09:16.380
Uh,wauwatosa is an upper-middle-class
suburb approximately 15 minutes from here.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.650
All the women were abducted
from there in the afternoon

09:18.660 --> 09:21.080
and turned up here in
the morning 2 days later.

09:21.090 --> 09:24.420
All this foot traffic
and no one saw anything.

09:24.430 --> 09:29.100
Well,he,up,wraps the bodies,uh,loosely
so they're not immediately recognizable.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.660
Eventually the,uh,wrapping comes oNPe

09:31.670 --> 09:35.600
my guess is he,uh,has a van or
a truck,something he can back up

09:35.610 --> 09:37.580
so he's shielded when he makes the drop.

09:37.590 --> 09:40.080
No prints on whatever he wraps them in?

09:40.090 --> 09:43.150
There have been traces
of paint and wood stain,

09:43.160 --> 09:45.980
but most of it's just common stuff
you'd get at any hardware store.

09:45.990 --> 09:49.220
He's trying to demean
them,putting them out like trash.

09:49.230 --> 09:51.330
This guy might work or live around here.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.200
Gets off on the reaction
to his... handiwork.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.010
What can you tell us about the victim?

09:56.020 --> 09:57.730
She was taken from a supermarket.

09:57.740 --> 10:00.980
Her husband says that most days she would
have been picking up her son at school,

10:00.990 --> 10:03.540
but he was spending the
afternoon at a friend'S.

10:03.550 --> 10:06.810
- This is your fifth victim,right?
- Yes.

10:07.420 --> 10:09.140
You should have called us sooner.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.440
I thought we had a handle on it.

10:10.450 --> 10:12.980
- Apparently not.
- Ma'am.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.130
Excuse me,sir.

10:18.320 --> 10:22.060
We need to work with these detectives.

10:22.070 --> 10:23.460
I'm sorry?

10:23.470 --> 10:25.500
We don't generally criticize them.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.970
It just really doesn't get us anything.

10:27.980 --> 10:31.740
Are you saying it wouldn't be
helpful if he had contacted us sooner?

10:31.750 --> 10:32.870
Well,of course.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.490
- It's always,you know,the sooner the better.
- Right.

10:37.660 --> 10:39.860
And agent jareau...

10:40.120 --> 10:42.290
don't question me again.

10:59.470 --> 11:00.640
Is jack still napping?

11:00.650 --> 11:02.530
I thought this was over.

11:02.540 --> 11:05.860
It is. I'm just curious.

11:08.510 --> 11:09.970
Hello?

11:10.990 --> 11:12.440
Hello?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.410
What did the section chief say?

11:32.490 --> 11:37.400
She suggested that I transfer to
a white collar crime taskforce.

11:37.410 --> 11:38.800
Would you have to travel?

11:38.810 --> 11:41.310
No,I'd have a 9:00 to 5:00 life.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.800
Then it's a no-brainer.

11:54.490 --> 11:55.810
- Hey.
- How's it going?

11:55.820 --> 12:00.080
Well,strauss just offended the lead detective
45 seconds into her first crime scene.

12:00.090 --> 12:01.080
I'm not surprised.

12:01.090 --> 12:02.670
This isn't about to
get any better,is it?

12:02.680 --> 12:03.330
I doubt it.

12:03.340 --> 12:05.250
Morgan,listen,I've been
looking at the file.

12:05.260 --> 12:09.110
Milwaukee schools start at
8:10 and they get out at 3:10.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.940
Every abduction has taken place within
15 minutes of school getting out.

12:12.950 --> 12:15.680
And each body was dumped within
15 minutes of the first bell.

12:15.690 --> 12:18.820
We could easily be looking at somebody
who works in the school system.

12:18.830 --> 12:20.630
Ok. Thanks,man.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.750
Any idea how's he's getting control of these
women? Is he blitzing them or coercing them?

12:24.760 --> 12:26.630
- So far we're coming up blank.
- Ok.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.360
Keep me posted.

12:47.370 --> 12:48.660
You scared me.

12:48.670 --> 12:50.780
I'm looking for my dad.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.180
- Are you lost?
- I'm not lost.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.900
I'm just not sure where I am.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.350
Ok. Maybe I can help you?

13:06.070 --> 13:08.470
Are you sure this is what your dad said?

13:08.480 --> 13:12.810
He said if anything happened,to meet him on
the side because it wouldn't be so crowded.

13:13.950 --> 13:15.790
Hey.Hey.

13:16.340 --> 13:17.080
Hey,there you are.

13:17.090 --> 13:19.140
Hey,guy,I was worried.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.980
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.480
I'm sorry I tricked
you. My dad's just shy.

13:28.830 --> 13:34.140
I want you to smile and ask if you can come home
with us,or I'm gonna gut the boy like a deer.

13:38.570 --> 13:41.290
Would you mind if I came home with you?

13:43.290 --> 13:45.340
I'd like that.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.890
Well,then.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.120
hey. What do we know?

14:00.130 --> 14:01.760
Woman's name is claire thompson.

14:01.770 --> 14:03.080
Husband tried to reach
her on the cell phone.

14:03.090 --> 14:05.740
When she didn't pick up,he
drove to the department store.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.260
Car's in the parking
lot,but she's not inside.

14:08.270 --> 14:10.020
- Is that the husband?
- Yeah.

14:10.030 --> 14:12.310
J.J.,Take strauss with you.

14:12.530 --> 14:16.190
- I had the department store uplink the security footage to your analyst in quantico.
- perfect

14:16.200 --> 14:17.770
My desk is over here.

14:20.590 --> 14:22.910
Garcia,baby girl,please tell
me something I want to hear.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.990
You're a statuesque god of
sculpted chocolate thunder.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.940
How about something
I don't already know?

14:27.950 --> 14:28.940
I have a sweet tooth?

14:28.950 --> 14:31.290
Did you located the missing
girl on the security footage?

14:31.300 --> 14:34.450
On it. It's coming
your way in 5,4,3,2...

14:34.460 --> 14:35.160
I got it.

14:35.170 --> 14:37.450
Keep me on speaker,will you?

14:39.210 --> 14:41.640
She doesn't seem to
be on anyone's radar.

14:41.650 --> 14:42.370
Look. Who's the kid?

14:42.380 --> 14:44.240
Does claire thompson have a son?

14:44.250 --> 14:45.470
No. 2-year-old
daughter.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.960
It looks like the kid's lost.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.650
- Garcia,this all you got?
- That's it.

14:48.660 --> 14:52.250
Theyd urne tdown a hallway without
no security camera and we lose them.

14:53.200 --> 14:57.940
I'll get a list of missing kids,see if we
can make out a resemblance to any of them.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.980
- Oh,damn.
- What?

15:02.230 --> 15:03.830
Something hotch said.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.740
All the abductions and disposals
have been timed around school.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.060
We thought the unsub
might work in the system.

15:09.070 --> 15:13.110
What if this guy's actually using
his own son to lure his victims?

15:16.190 --> 15:19.400
Detective wolynski told us you're
trying to single out trucks and vans.

15:19.410 --> 15:20.540
That's smart.

15:20.550 --> 15:23.260
The unsub is dumping his vic msti in the
business district,so I'd agree with you--

15:23.270 --> 15:25.400
he's probably not driving
something that would stand out.

15:25.410 --> 15:29.300
He may even have some type of company
logo on the side of his vehicle as well.

15:29.310 --> 15:32.130
We know that he abducts
the women in wauwatosa

15:32.140 --> 15:34.620
and dumps their bodies
somewhere in the third ward.

15:34.630 --> 15:38.380
Most unsubs keep their area of
control-- where they kill their victims--

15:38.390 --> 15:40.820
triangulated between the two points.

15:40.830 --> 15:43.560
Which means that the unsub probably
lives in wauwatosa or the third ward.

15:43.570 --> 15:44.740
Somewhere in that area.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.200
And the people who live
there know the unsub.

15:47.210 --> 15:49.870
There's no sexual
component to these crimes,

15:49.880 --> 15:52.890
which means it's more about
the unsub making a point.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.330
He's cutting their hearts out.

15:55.340 --> 16:00.270
It might just be that this is the sickest way
the unsub knows to disfigure the women and...

16:00.280 --> 16:02.810
throw them out like trash.
'T canwe really know.

16:02.820 --> 16:05.480
The two most important
questions to ask ourselves are:

16:05.490 --> 16:08.450
What is this guy doing with
these women for 48 hours?

16:08.460 --> 16:11.320
And why is he willing to use
his own son to abduct them?

16:11.330 --> 16:16.410
And if he is truly using his own son,then it's likely
that he has what we call borderline personality disorder.

16:16.420 --> 16:21.150
Now,borderlines-- they think that all
relationships revolve entirely around them.

16:21.160 --> 16:25.540
When they set their mind to
something,absolute-- there is no gray area.

16:25.550 --> 16:29.450
It would also manifest in a way atth would
be visible to people around the unsub.

16:29.460 --> 16:32.430
Intense bouts of anger and
depression,problems drinking.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.740
He aould wlso be highly
sensitive to rejection.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.170
And one last thing.

16:36.180 --> 16:38.760
It is not easy to crack
clean into breastbone.

16:38.770 --> 16:41.470
You're dealing with a guy who works with
his hands and he's used to hard labor.

16:41.480 --> 16:44.590
At the very least,he's
not afraid to get dirty.

17:08.349 --> 17:11.609
Now,I'm gonna take that out of your
mouth and you're gonna be really quiet.

17:11.619 --> 17:14.480
Like a doll. Ok?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.579
Oh,that's good.

17:23.589 --> 17:26.020
Let's go on upstairs.

17:26.500 --> 17:30.760
And you're gonna be
really,really nice to the boy.

17:32.150 --> 17:35.240
Not like the little
bitch we all know you are.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.420
You understand?

17:41.490 --> 17:43.310
Say it!

17:45.250 --> 17:47.550
I understand.

17:49.450 --> 17:50.930
Lovely.

17:51.810 --> 17:54.740
- Haley?Ok,mac and cheese.
- Got it

17:54.750 --> 17:56.190
- Here you go.Good boy.
- Hello

17:56.880 --> 17:59.580
- Mac and cheese.
- Ah,it's the best.

17:59.590 --> 18:01.530
- It's morgan.
- Thanks.

18:02.870 --> 18:03.610
Yeah,what's up?

18:03.620 --> 18:06.300
You know I wouldn't be calling
you unless I was desperate.

18:06.310 --> 18:07.530
Still no gideon?

18:07.540 --> 18:08.780
No,not a word.

18:08.790 --> 18:10.850
Reid's starting to worry about him.

18:11.350 --> 18:13.060
We really need you out here,man.

18:13.070 --> 18:15.410
Morgan,I've already put in for
the transfer. It's a done deal.

18:15.420 --> 18:18.170
No,you didn'T. Not yet,anyway.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.670
It's not in the system,hotch,not yet.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.200
Come on. You know this case.

18:22.210 --> 18:23.920
You could pitch in on just this one.

18:23.930 --> 18:27.080
We think he might be using his
own kid to lure these women,man.

18:27.090 --> 18:29.480
He just picked up another one.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.850
- Hotch.
- I got to think.

18:58.390 --> 19:00.140
What are you doing?

19:00.150 --> 19:03.840
- Multiplication.
- Multiplication.

19:04.780 --> 19:07.180
- That's hard.
- It's extra credit.

19:07.190 --> 19:10.170
The rest of the class is
still on long division.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.400
Maybe I could help you.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.790
- It's ok.
- I'm really good at math.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.010
The boy...

19:23.420 --> 19:26.660
Has got to learn to
do things by himself.

19:26.670 --> 19:30.390
No,of course.

19:33.450 --> 19:36.870
But you can make me a sandwich.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.830
- Ok.
- Come on.

19:46.730 --> 19:48.790
Let's go clean up your room.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.920
Help!

20:40.000 --> 20:41.330
What the hell are you doing?

20:41.340 --> 20:42.830
Keep your voice down.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.760
Gideon didn't show in
milwaukee and the team needs me.

20:46.770 --> 20:47.890
I don't believe this.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.720
Don't worry,it won't affect my transfer.

20:49.730 --> 20:51.630
I've been working on an existing case.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.840
You're not working on this case.

20:53.850 --> 20:56.450
I can't just switch
off my loyalty,haley.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.450
They suspended you for 2 weeks.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.850
Who are you being loyal to?

21:00.860 --> 21:01.960
The team needs me.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.560
No,they need gideon.

21:04.570 --> 21:07.020
Do you know what this guy's doing to
women in milwaukee? I don't want to know.

21:07.030 --> 21:10.350
He's using his son to lure them,he's holding
them,and then he's cutting their hearts out.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.240
Aaron,stop!

21:14.500 --> 21:17.940
Don't make me the monster here.

21:18.990 --> 21:24.620
I feel sick about these women,but when
this case is over,there will be another one.

21:24.630 --> 21:27.140
And another one and another one.

21:27.150 --> 21:30.380
It is never going to stop.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.090
This is who I am.

21:32.350 --> 21:33.850
No...

21:33.860 --> 21:36.940
this is what you do.

21:36.950 --> 21:39.870
I'm trying to do the
right thing,here and there,

21:39.880 --> 21:44.080
and I would really
appreciate a little support.

21:45.540 --> 21:46.550
that's right.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.830
'Cause you always need to be the hero.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.940
- Don't give me that.
- No.

21:49.950 --> 21:53.650
Obviously a happy life
isn't enough for you.

21:56.210 --> 21:59.770
- ******
- I'll be back...

21:59.780 --> 22:02.050
as soon as this case is over.

22:03.790 --> 22:08.000
Yeah,well,make sure you give
your son a kiss before you leave.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.450
can I come in?

22:32.520 --> 22:35.550
the team needs us. They're
working on a case in milwaukee.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.820
Gideon hasn't shown up,and don't tell
me you quit or I put in for a transfer.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.630
You put in for a transfer?

22:41.640 --> 22:45.720
They're both still hung up in the system,so technically
we're in dereliction of duty by not being there.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.730
I'm sorry,I can't go.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.100
Right. Sorry I barged in.

22:50.110 --> 22:51.990
Wait. Wait.Can
I ask--

22:52.000 --> 22:53.480
why are you really here?

22:55.150 --> 22:56.660
I told you.

22:58.830 --> 23:02.250
I think strauss came to you
and asked for dirt on me.

23:03.890 --> 23:05.940
Why would she do that?

23:05.950 --> 23:09.660
I think if you have your eyes
on top leadership at the fbi,

23:09.670 --> 23:12.320
you want to know who
might stand in your way.

23:13.090 --> 23:16.110
And... what could i have told her?

23:16.120 --> 23:19.500
That one of my agents might have
murdered a suspect in cold blood.

23:19.510 --> 23:22.250
Or another might have a serious
drug problem which I didn't report,

23:22.260 --> 23:25.590
and if strauss had any
evidence,my career would be over.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.390
I think she put you on our team
and expected something in return.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.280
And to your credit,you quit.

23:31.290 --> 23:33.780
Rather than whisper in her ear.

23:35.770 --> 23:37.370
I told you.

23:37.380 --> 23:39.510
I hate politics.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.230
Come to milwaukee.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.520
I'll make you a deal.

23:42.530 --> 23:47.270
If your ready bag isn't
here,packed,I won't bug you anymore.

23:48.150 --> 23:51.850
If it is,I want you on that
plane with me. One more case.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.230
I already turned in my badge and my gun.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.220
That's just hardware.

24:00.720 --> 24:05.600
I have triple patrol in the area and I've
got every available unit recanvassing.

24:05.950 --> 24:08.900
It's tough knowing they're out
there and we're still a step behind.

24:09.400 --> 24:13.370
You know,it used to be a running joke that
if you told people you were from milwaukee,

24:13.380 --> 24:17.540
all they wanted to talk
about was happy days reruns.

24:17.550 --> 24:21.690
And then dahmer happens and they ask
you about it as if it's the same thing.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.960
As if it's entertainment.

24:24.310 --> 24:26.370
But I was in that apartment.

24:26.380 --> 24:30.670
Gideon,one of our bosses,says that there
are things that attach to you that...

24:30.680 --> 24:32.750
you can never wash off.

24:32.760 --> 24:36.850
All righ it,t-- is it possible
we're looking at this the wrong way?

24:36.860 --> 24:38.090
What do you mean?

24:38.100 --> 24:40.290
Well,we're trying to
zero in on the unsub.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.720
Now,you guys tell me,but...

24:42.730 --> 24:48.110
if he really is using his son,wouldn't the
trauma manifest more clearly on the boy?

24:51.910 --> 24:55.760
Can your analyst get a list of all the
children in the area that we're targeting?

24:55.770 --> 24:57.960
Garcia can get you whatever you want.

25:01.490 --> 25:03.530
Talk dirty to me.

25:03.540 --> 25:05.090
I--

25:06.600 --> 25:09.750
This is section chief erin strauss.

25:09.760 --> 25:13.880
Ma'am,I think it goes without saying that
I was expecting it to be someone else.

25:14.340 --> 25:18.060
I need a list of every grade school
in the third ward and wauwatosa.

25:18.070 --> 25:19.650
Yes,ma'am.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.180
the third ward has one
public grade school,

25:23.190 --> 25:26.230
but there appears to be 4 private
schools that draw from that area.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.990
And wauwatosa?

25:28.630 --> 25:30.440
That would be 9,ma'am.

25:30.450 --> 25:32.860
- And how many students?
- 3200

25:32.870 --> 25:36.060
Can you also get me a list
of every guidance counselor

25:36.070 --> 25:38.910
that deals directly with the
student body in that area?

25:38.920 --> 25:39.940
Certainly,ma'am.

25:39.950 --> 25:41.750
And again,I'd like to a...

25:41.760 --> 25:46.150
You need to present these counselors
with a profile of a troubled kid.

25:51.360 --> 25:55.190
The boy we're looking for is
possibly from a single-parent home.

25:55.550 --> 25:57.810
He's sullen and withdrawn.

25:58.030 --> 26:01.190
He may have been caught stealing
things from his female teachers.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.980
He's more than likely clinging to maternal
figures in inappropriate settings--

26:04.990 --> 26:08.290
hugging the female bus
driver,the woman in the lunchroom.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.660
His classmates might notice this
inappropriate behavior and tease him,

26:11.670 --> 26:14.110
which makes the boy incredibly angry.

26:14.450 --> 26:16.610
- That many.
- I'm afraid so.

26:16.620 --> 26:18.100
Well,thank you.

27:00.650 --> 27:03.080
- How was school?
- Ok.

27:05.210 --> 27:07.090
It was just ok?

27:07.930 --> 27:10.610
- Is the lady still at home?
- Yeah.

27:11.350 --> 27:13.720
- Is she gonna leave?
- I don't know.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.250
I don't want her to.

27:16.260 --> 27:19.790
Sometimes things
happen. Grown-up things.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.770
- I don't want this
one to go. - But they--

27:25.830 --> 27:28.260
they all leave.Ok?

27:28.270 --> 27:31.640
- Maybe they all leave because of you.
- What?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.460
I know you're old enough
to understand this.

27:33.470 --> 27:36.850
I will not always be around!

27:42.730 --> 27:44.460
They all leave. All of them.

27:44.470 --> 27:48.470
They leave,they leave,they
leave. Do you understand me?

27:51.890 --> 27:53.470
It's all right.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.210
It's ok,all right?

27:56.900 --> 27:59.160
I'm just trying to teach you something.

28:04.410 --> 28:07.380
All right,the boy doesn't look
like he could be any older than 7.

28:07.390 --> 28:08.810
Let's work youngest to oldest.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.010
Start with the worbe sthavior.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.930
Get the names of the
parents,send them over to garcia.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.910
She can cross-check
for criminal records.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.490
This guy's dumping bodies between
7:30 and 8:00. That gives us...

28:17.500 --> 28:19.680
a little over 12 hours
to make something hit.

28:19.690 --> 28:22.020
- Let's get it done.
- Look who's here.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.380
Hey. Where do we start?

28:28.010 --> 28:29.800
How fast can you get us up to speed?

28:29.810 --> 28:31.690
How fast can you sit down?

28:41.310 --> 28:43.090
We're only here to help.

28:45.210 --> 28:47.620
We'll deal with this later.

28:57.620 --> 28:59.510
It's impossible. There's too many.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.880
Keep looking,reid.
We still have an hour.

29:03.300 --> 29:06.450
Thank you,by the way,for giving
garcia that file to give to me.

29:06.460 --> 29:09.870
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see garcia before I left.

29:31.710 --> 29:34.810
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

29:37.630 --> 29:40.450
Do you mind if I have some cereal?

29:40.460 --> 29:42.260
I guess not.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.620
He's gonna kill you,you know.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.060
Are you all right?

30:29.640 --> 30:32.880
I st--I stepped
on her hair.

30:33.610 --> 30:37.210
If you need a second,take a
second. This is what it is.

30:37.220 --> 30:39.790
Just don't let the
public see you break down.

30:44.380 --> 30:47.150
This is a different area from
the other dump sites,isn't it?

30:47.160 --> 30:48.150
Reid: He's getting smart.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.470
He knows where all of our manpower
will be so he's changing locations.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.240
How long before he changes
when and where he abducts them?

30:54.250 --> 30:56.200
He does that,we're back at zero.

30:56.210 --> 30:57.560
Claire?

30:59.600 --> 31:01.990
No,no,no,no. We gotta
keep him out of here.

31:07.540 --> 31:09.780
Morgan says you're worried about gideon.

31:10.810 --> 31:13.390
I keep on calling
him,he doesn't call back.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.420
He's probably at his cabin.
That's where he goes when he...

31:17.010 --> 31:18.710
needs to get away.

31:20.020 --> 31:22.910
- Reid,I need your head in this.
- I know.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.680
So what's around the dump site?

31:25.690 --> 31:30.240
Here's the old printing press of
quad graphics,and the paving yard,

31:30.250 --> 31:33.520
and then the concrete factory
where we found the body.

31:33.530 --> 31:35.610
None of them visible from the highway.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.350
You don't end up there by accident.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.920
So we go back to the schools,we
eliminate the third ward,

31:39.930 --> 31:43.890
and we target problem kids whose fathers have
held blue-collar jobs over the last 10 years.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.340
- What if he's not a problem kid?
- What?

31:46.350 --> 31:48.350
Forget it. It's off
the textbook profile.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.230
What is it,reid?

31:49.240 --> 31:53.750
Sometimes when a parent is unstable,especially
if the other one's out of the picture,

31:54.090 --> 31:56.550
you'll do anything to
be the perfect child.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.990
Like help your father abduct women?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.050
They're never late for school.

32:01.060 --> 32:03.020
Even with the abductions,the
disposal of the bodies,

32:03.030 --> 32:06.420
it's always timed perfectly so
the kid will be on time to school.

32:06.430 --> 32:09.370
I don't think the killer would
care. I think the kid would.

32:13.460 --> 32:16.520
Fbi. Technical analyst
penelope garcia speaking.

32:16.530 --> 32:20.090
Garcia,I need a list of parents
from the wauwatosa school district,

32:20.100 --> 32:22.310
eliminating any two-parent households

32:22.320 --> 32:25.750
or any fathers holding white collar
jobs that aren't labor management.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.020
You'll see it flying over
the transom momentarily.

32:28.030 --> 32:32.830
And one more thing-- the glitches in
the transfers and resignations stop now.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.850
Uh--
yes,sir.

32:35.860 --> 32:38.200
- And,garcia...
- yes?

32:38.560 --> 32:39.980
Thank you.

32:42.410 --> 32:44.150
He's a kid that's a model student.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.720
Not just straight as,though.

32:45.730 --> 32:50.350
It's someone who tries to please in a way that
the other teachers have probably talked about.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.800
Inventing extra-credit projects,

32:52.810 --> 32:56.630
volunteering to skip recess to help
clean the classroom,stuff like that.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.950
David smith.

32:57.960 --> 32:58.980
Do you know his father?

32:58.990 --> 33:00.810
Oh,it's such a sad story.

33:00.820 --> 33:02.850
The teachers all talk about it.

33:02.860 --> 33:07.910
He was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor 6
months ago,and his wife left the two of them.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.390
She just left?

33:09.400 --> 33:12.140
Yeah. I don't know what's
gonna happen to david.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.070
Thank you for driving me.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.600
you know,I can't just leave you here.

33:18.610 --> 33:20.820
I have to make sure your dad's home.

33:20.830 --> 33:22.380
I know.

33:35.660 --> 33:38.370
I can't imagine david's father
being someone you're looking for.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.830
He's very involved.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.040
He drops david off and
picks him up every day.

33:42.050 --> 33:43.870
Do you happen to know
what kind of car he drives?

33:43.880 --> 33:45.390
A van,maybe?

33:45.400 --> 33:46.940
I can't say. Something big.

33:46.950 --> 33:48.480
He makes hand-crafted furniture.

33:48.490 --> 33:49.830
I know he does deliveries.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.560
- Miss bennett.
- Just continue working.

33:52.570 --> 33:54.370
We're looking for david smith.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.000
You just missed him.

33:56.010 --> 33:57.080
Do you know where he went?

33:57.090 --> 34:00.610
He wasn't feeling well,so the nurse volunteered
to drive him home to help out david's father.

34:00.620 --> 34:01.950
Thank you.

34:14.270 --> 34:16.380
The boy's alone in the family room.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.219
Where are your other agents?

34:18.230 --> 34:19.090
Covering the other side.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.570
They have an eye-line just in case
somebody tries to sneak out the back.

34:21.580 --> 34:23.199
Is there any sign of
the nurse or the dad?

34:23.210 --> 34:24.870
No.

34:27.469 --> 34:29.290
Go ahead,you want to scream,scream.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.350
Go ahead and scream!

34:31.360 --> 34:33.810
- The school knows that I'm here!
- Yes,yes.

34:33.820 --> 34:36.690
You dropped the boy off,I
thanked you,and then you left.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.980
They'll find your car in the
parking lot of the mayfair mall.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.560
I was trying to help your son.

34:43.469 --> 34:44.679
So what are we doing here?

34:44.690 --> 34:47.350
We call in S.W.A.T.,Secu trehe
perimeter,and wait for him to come out.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.449
Ma'am,he's holding a woman inside.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.260
We don't know that for certain.

34:50.270 --> 34:51.969
We don't have probable cause.

34:51.980 --> 34:53.010
She's right.

34:53.020 --> 34:54.710
If he's got her,he waits 48 hours.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.300
He's not gonna kill her yet.

34:56.310 --> 34:59.670
He's changed the pattern of the dump
sites,and now he's changed how he abducts them.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.920
Do we really want to gamble that he's
sticking to the rest of the model?

35:01.930 --> 35:03.590
So let's pound on the door.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.450
Maybe he'll panic.

35:04.460 --> 35:07.030
But he could spook just
enough to kill her early.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.580
Let me go in alone.

35:08.590 --> 35:09.570
The boy's in the family room.

35:09.580 --> 35:11.680
- He'll answer the door.
- No.

35:11.690 --> 35:14.020
We need to get invited in that door.

35:14.030 --> 35:15.700
He's looking for female
authority figures.

35:15.710 --> 35:19.230
If he lets me in,I can signal as soon
as I see anything that gives us cause.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.440
Technically,you're not even in the fbi.

35:21.450 --> 35:22.250
All the better.

35:22.260 --> 35:24.780
She's interfering with
a federal investigation.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.540
Well,if I'm no longer in the fbi,then
you have no authority over me.

35:27.550 --> 35:29.910
I'm just a civilian knocking
on a little boy's door.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.600
- Prentiss.
- 3Q

35:31.610 --> 35:35.700
- As soon as you have probable cause,give us a signal and get out of there.
- Ok.

35:40.390 --> 35:43.360
Everybody knows what we need
to make this arrest legal.

35:56.060 --> 35:57.100
hi.

35:57.110 --> 35:59.300
Are you david?

35:59.310 --> 36:01.300
Your dad asked me to come by.

36:01.310 --> 36:02.250
He's busy.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.860
Would it be ok if i came in and waited?

36:05.320 --> 36:07.300
I guess.

36:07.310 --> 36:08.740
Thank you.

36:14.870 --> 36:18.210
My dad says it's unsafe to
leave your door unlocked.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.110
Smart man.

36:21.180 --> 36:23.330
Prentiss is in. We're waiting on her go.

36:24.150 --> 36:25.660
So...

36:26.460 --> 36:28.480
where is your dad?

36:29.230 --> 36:31.650
He's working in there.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.290
Is he alone

36:40.400 --> 36:43.880
would it be ok if I just
let him know I was waiting?

36:43.890 --> 36:46.660
He doesn't like me to go
down there when he's working.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.550
Oh,no,you don't have to.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.040
Um,I just gonna go and
see if he's to obusy.

36:52.050 --> 36:56.400
And we can both be really
quiet,ok? Can you be quiet?

37:13.600 --> 37:14.770
Who is this?

37:14.780 --> 37:15.770
Where did she come from?

37:15.780 --> 37:18.130
- She said she knew you.
- What?

37:18.140 --> 37:20.400
She said she knew you.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.340
- ****
- I can'T.

37:23.900 --> 37:24.720
Take it.

37:25.790 --> 37:28.200
It's ok.Just...

37:28.210 --> 37:29.550
no.

37:29.560 --> 37:30.880
Point it right here.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.870
*******right thing

37:35.520 --> 37:38.140
*********

37:39.600 --> 37:40.720
Let's go!

37:49.580 --> 37:51.280
Drop the weapon,son.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.190
Give me the gun.

37:57.170 --> 37:58.490
Here.

37:58.820 --> 38:00.250
That's ok.

38:00.910 --> 38:02.910
Do what they say.

38:12.930 --> 38:13.690
Are you ok?

38:13.700 --> 38:16.590
- Ah,I'll be fine.
- ******

38:17.720 --> 38:21.450
You're dying,and this is what
you want to leave your son?

38:35.940 --> 38:37.260
How's your head?

38:37.690 --> 38:39.310
I'll live.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.940
Is it weird I'm glad to be back?

38:41.950 --> 38:43.950
I'll make sure it stays official.

38:47.310 --> 38:50.470
- I'll be dead before I ever stand trial.
- Good.

38:55.510 --> 38:59.770
You know,I never even told the
boy to bring me this last one.

39:04.780 --> 39:06.190
How's she doing?

39:06.200 --> 39:07.710
She's gonna be ok.

39:08.590 --> 39:13.540
- You know,I can't officially approve of how this transpired,right?
- No.

39:14.230 --> 39:15.380
The arrest was clean.

39:15.390 --> 39:18.640
It would be a mistake
to break up this team.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.410
None of you will ever move up the
chain of command. You know that.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.720
Why would I ever want
to leave the B.A.U.

39:29.290 --> 39:30.930
Hotch.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.590
You mean that? You're
not gonna leave us?

39:34.600 --> 39:37.570
I don't know. I gotta talk to haley.

40:36.390 --> 40:37.330
haley?

41:27.450 --> 41:28.720
Gideon?

41:34.850 --> 41:36.360
Gideon?

42:20.520 --> 42:24.770
Spencer,I knew it would be you who
came to the cabin to check on me.

42:25.180 --> 42:28.030
I'm sorry the explanation
couldn't be better.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.630
And I'm sorry it
doesn't make more sense.

42:30.640 --> 42:35.410
But I've already told you,I just
don't understand any of it anymore.

42:38.630 --> 42:40.060
you get enough to eat,honey?

42:40.070 --> 42:41.810
Oh,yeah.

42:41.820 --> 42:43.330
- You travelin'?
- Yeah

42:43.920 --> 42:45.480
Where you headed?

42:45.920 --> 42:47.830
Nowhere in particular.

42:48.850 --> 42:51.120
How will you know when you get there?

42:51.620 --> 42:53.750
That's a good question...

42:53.760 --> 42:55.340
rose.

42:56.020 --> 42:57.450
A very good question.

42:57.460 --> 42:59.880
- Have a great day.
- You too

43:12.970 --> 43:15.220
I guess I'm just looking for it again.

43:16.030 --> 43:18.510
For the belief I had back in college.

43:19.790 --> 43:23.590
The belief I had when I first met
sarah and it all seemed so right.

43:25.660 --> 43:27.510
the belief in happy endings.
