WEBVTT

00:08.367 --> 00:10.833
- It's been a while
since that bell rang.

00:10.833 --> 00:11.900
Can we go yet?

00:11.900 --> 00:14.100
- Shh.
Not yet.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.100
Signing up
for Battle of the Bands

00:16.100 --> 00:17.567
is huge for us.

00:17.567 --> 00:19.300
We have to sneak out

00:19.300 --> 00:21.233
so we don't arouse suspicion.

00:22.267 --> 00:24.067
I'll scope the hall.

00:24.067 --> 00:27.400
Hyah!

00:34.733 --> 00:35.733
- Did you see anyone?

00:35.733 --> 00:37.133
- I don't know.

00:37.133 --> 00:39.167
It all happened so fast.

00:39.167 --> 00:41.167
And I was upside down a lot.

00:42.467 --> 00:44.133
- Wait, if this is
just the sign-ups

00:44.133 --> 00:46.300
for the audition,
why do we all have to go?

00:46.300 --> 00:48.100
- Because we're a band!

00:48.100 --> 00:50.467
We do things together.

00:50.467 --> 00:55.200
Plus if my van breaks down,
I'm gonna need you guys to push.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.000
Okay, let's move out.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.533
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:01.300 --> 01:04.467
- Whoa.
- This is awesome.

01:04.467 --> 01:06.567
- Everybody, everybody,
stay calm.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.333
I'm kind of a big deal
in the Austin music scene,

01:10.333 --> 01:12.633
so don't be surprised
if I get mobbed.

01:12.633 --> 01:15.067
- Excuse me,
are you Dewey Finn?

01:15.067 --> 01:16.667
[children exclaiming]

01:16.667 --> 01:18.900
- You know it.

01:18.900 --> 01:19.967
See, guys?

01:19.967 --> 01:21.667
- Security!

01:24.667 --> 01:28.067
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

01:28.067 --> 01:30.433
* It all adds up
to one thing *

01:30.433 --> 01:31.967
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.500
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

01:34.500 --> 01:37.133
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

01:37.133 --> 01:40.100
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

01:40.100 --> 01:41.700
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

01:41.700 --> 01:43.433
*

01:43.433 --> 01:45.433
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

01:45.433 --> 01:47.900
* There's a answer
right in front of you *

01:47.900 --> 01:50.600
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

01:50.600 --> 01:52.367
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

01:52.367 --> 01:53.600
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

01:57.867 --> 01:59.500
- Who let this guy in?

01:59.500 --> 02:02.067
Dewey Finn is banned
from this club.

02:02.067 --> 02:03.633
- What? Why?

02:03.633 --> 02:06.833
- Last time you played here,
you started a burrito riot.

02:06.833 --> 02:09.233
- Hey, I don't have control
over the audience.

02:09.233 --> 02:13.833
- You sang a song called,
"Let's Start a Burrito Riot."

02:13.833 --> 02:17.100
- Wow, I didn't know how much
competition there'd be.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.900
These guys
all look serious.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.933
- Yeah.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.767
- [playing guitar riff]

02:26.467 --> 02:29.167
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

02:29.167 --> 02:30.500
What's a little kid
like you know?

02:30.500 --> 02:32.300
- Oh, you're right.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.400
Can I borrow that?

02:35.333 --> 02:38.967
- [playing elaborate riff]

02:50.400 --> 02:52.900
- You destroyed that guy!

02:52.900 --> 02:55.133
- My parents always tell me
if I'm going to do something

02:55.133 --> 02:56.467
I should be the best.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.067
Why do it
if I'm not going to win?

02:58.067 --> 02:59.800
- My parents raised me
to be happy

02:59.800 --> 03:02.100
if I come in third.

03:02.100 --> 03:05.167
- Hey, I heard you riffing.

03:05.167 --> 03:09.167
I'm Justin from Night Lizard.

03:09.167 --> 03:11.067
- Zack.
School of Rock.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.833
- Is that your leader?

03:12.833 --> 03:14.633
- Please, Vince, please!

03:14.633 --> 03:16.533
- Sir, if you let us sign up,

03:16.533 --> 03:18.100
he'll pay you back
for the damage he caused.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.800
- Yeah, uh, sure.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.933
How much do I owe you?

03:20.933 --> 03:23.500
- $4,200.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.633
- I don't have that.

03:26.633 --> 03:30.467
But this card is two punches
away from a free frozen yogurt.

03:31.933 --> 03:33.267
- You wouldn't have

03:33.267 --> 03:34.800
those kind of problems
if you join Night Lizard.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.633
The reason we've won
two Battle of the Bands

03:37.633 --> 03:39.667
is 'cause we treat our band
like a business.

03:39.667 --> 03:42.900
If you don't perform,
you're out.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.400
That reminds me.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.500
You're out!

03:46.500 --> 03:48.633
- [plays angry chord]

03:50.333 --> 03:53.400
- You are totally
Lizard material, Zack.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.867
What do you say?

03:54.867 --> 03:56.400
Want to join our band?

03:56.400 --> 03:59.133
- Like I said,
I'm in School of Rock.

03:59.133 --> 04:02.067
Thanks anyway.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.900
- Vince, let's sit down

04:03.900 --> 04:06.433
and talk this out
like mature adults.

04:09.633 --> 04:13.067
- And now you owe me
for the table.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.867
- Mr. Vince, I understand
your frustration with Mr. Finn.

04:15.867 --> 04:18.433
He's irresponsible,
he's selfish,

04:18.433 --> 04:19.733
he rarely showers.
- Yeah.

04:19.733 --> 04:21.233
- Where are you going
with this?

04:21.233 --> 04:22.767
- Trust me.

04:22.767 --> 04:25.367
But the band isn't just Mr.Finn.
It's us kids.

04:25.367 --> 04:26.600
Do you want the press out here,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.967
seeing how rough
you treat orphans?

04:28.967 --> 04:31.433
- You're orphans?
- You're orphans?

04:31.433 --> 04:33.633
- As far as
the TV reporters know.

04:33.633 --> 04:36.300
And when they see us
in front of your club

04:36.300 --> 04:37.833
crying our eyes out

04:37.833 --> 04:40.633
about that mean man--
you--

04:40.633 --> 04:42.767
it might not be
so good for business.

04:42.767 --> 04:45.100
- I have "Local News Five"
on speed dial.

04:45.100 --> 04:47.733
[phone ringing]
Oops, it's ringing.

04:47.733 --> 04:49.600
- Okay, you win.
I'll let you audition.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.067
Just hang up.

04:51.067 --> 04:54.767
Man, 12-year-old girls
play hardball.

04:54.767 --> 04:58.967
- You wouldn't last five seconds
at one of our sleepovers.

05:01.967 --> 05:04.167
- All right, let's do this.

05:04.167 --> 05:05.533
One, two, three--

05:07.467 --> 05:08.967
What are you doing?

05:08.967 --> 05:11.067
- Oh, I'm marking the size
of the stage at the club

05:11.067 --> 05:12.767
for our Battle of the Bands
audition.

05:12.767 --> 05:14.900
- Is that really necessary?

05:14.900 --> 05:17.567
No, but our audition song
has no tambourine,

05:17.567 --> 05:19.367
unless you want me
to play tambourine.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.433
all: No!

05:20.433 --> 05:23.067
- Fine.
I need something to do.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.467
So I've named myself the band's

05:24.467 --> 05:26.767
official tape measurer.

05:26.767 --> 05:29.500
Do not take this away from me!

05:29.500 --> 05:31.967
- Okay,
you're the tape measurer.

05:31.967 --> 05:34.567
- Good. Now, according
to my measurements

05:34.567 --> 05:36.733
you guys could easily
fall off the stage.

05:38.433 --> 05:39.867
- What are you doing?

05:39.867 --> 05:41.733
- I don't want to
fall off the stage.

05:43.233 --> 05:45.633
I bruise like a peach.

05:45.633 --> 05:48.067
- Guys, we should start
rehearsing.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.833
Did you see those bands
at the sign-up?

05:49.833 --> 05:51.500
They're for real.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.600
I mean,
you all want to win, right?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.067
- Ooh, winning's at the top

05:55.067 --> 05:56.700
of my Battle of the Bands
checklist...

05:56.700 --> 05:59.133
right above kissing Freddy
in all the excitement.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.567
- What?
- What?

06:01.567 --> 06:04.467
- Dude, no one wants this
more than we do.

06:04.467 --> 06:05.967
Hit it, Freddy.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.467
- Do you have to start
with that endless drum fill

06:11.467 --> 06:13.067
every time we play a song?

06:13.067 --> 06:15.867
- Dude, what's the point
of being in a band

06:15.867 --> 06:17.467
if we can't goof around
a little?

06:17.467 --> 06:20.267
Staying loose
helps the creative process.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.200
- My creative process is to win.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.400
- Mine is too!

06:23.400 --> 06:25.367
Nothing's gonna hold us back.

06:25.367 --> 06:28.933
[amp pops and sizzles]

06:28.933 --> 06:31.200
That's gonna hold us back.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.767
- Zack, thanks for coming.

06:37.767 --> 06:39.633
- Not saying I'm in.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.333
I just came to hear you out.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.100
- You look parched, Zack.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.967
Here, have some water.

06:44.967 --> 06:47.633
Whoa!
It says Night Lizard on it.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.200
How'd that happen?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.533
Uh, we went on the Internet

06:50.533 --> 06:52.467
and found a guy
who would do it.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.100
Cold, right?

06:55.100 --> 06:57.567
Like the night
and the blood of a lizard.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.367
Now, let's get
down to business.

07:01.367 --> 07:03.867
If you join our band,
not only will you get

07:03.867 --> 07:06.367
an official Night Lizard jacket,

07:06.367 --> 07:12.633
but you'll get your very
own personalized guitar pick.

07:14.533 --> 07:16.667
Whoa!
It has your name and face on it.

07:16.667 --> 07:17.833
How'd we do that?

07:17.833 --> 07:19.900
The water guy also does picks.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.067
- You guys are good.

07:22.067 --> 07:26.600
- Also, our drummer works
at Floyd's Pancake Barn.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.300
So we get half-price pancakes.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.567
Whoa, is that two
Battle of the Bands trophies?

07:34.567 --> 07:38.133
Save your brain.
The answer is yes.

07:40.867 --> 07:42.967
Smell that, Zack?

07:42.967 --> 07:45.133
That's the sweet
smell of success...

07:45.133 --> 07:46.500
And syrup.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.300
If you join Night Lizard,

07:49.300 --> 07:52.300
you'll shine brightly
in the hottest band in Austin.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.800
Any questions?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.700
- Can I get bacon
with those pancakes?

07:56.700 --> 07:58.633
- Can he get bacon?

07:58.633 --> 08:00.300
Check your pockets, dude.

08:02.433 --> 08:04.667
- Pocket bacon?

08:05.600 --> 08:07.700
Rock star.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.067
- Okay, give it a try, Mr. Finn.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.800
[no amplification]

08:17.800 --> 08:20.233
- I thought you said
you were a technical genius?

08:20.233 --> 08:21.567
- This got me out of PE.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.067
I would've said anything.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.267
- Who wants checklists?

08:30.667 --> 08:32.733
No worries,
you're all getting one.

08:32.733 --> 08:36.233
This one has everyone's job
on the day of the big audition,

08:36.233 --> 08:39.767
and since there's no tambourine,
my job is to make checklists.

08:39.767 --> 08:42.333
Check.
Now we're jammin'.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.900
- No, we're not.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.400
Do you think we're gonna
play music at any point today?

08:46.400 --> 08:49.100
Like a professional band does?

08:49.100 --> 08:50.600
- Oh, weareprofessional.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.500
Give it another try, Mr. Finn.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.267
- All right.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.067
[feedback screeches]

08:59.700 --> 09:01.067
[yelling]
Amp's fixed!

09:01.067 --> 09:05.867
Did I just say
the amp was fixed?

09:05.867 --> 09:07.733
I can't hear myself!

09:09.067 --> 09:11.067
- Great, I'll put the grill
back on.

09:11.067 --> 09:13.867
Freddy, toss me that tool.

09:15.933 --> 09:17.833
Minor setback, guys.

09:17.833 --> 09:20.733
I'll have this
fixed in no time.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.300
- I may have overreacted.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.067
- You think?

09:40.233 --> 09:43.067
- That's it.
Justin's right.

09:43.067 --> 09:44.967
You guys are unprofessional.

09:44.967 --> 09:47.133
I'm sorry, but I quit.

09:47.133 --> 09:48.933
I'm joining Night Lizard.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.333
- I can't hear anything!

09:57.333 --> 10:00.967
Did he say he's becoming
a slight wizard?

10:02.267 --> 10:03.800
I smell bacon!

10:03.800 --> 10:05.933
Am I dying?

10:10.633 --> 10:13.100
- Zack!

10:13.100 --> 10:15.467
Zack, you can't quit.

10:15.467 --> 10:16.800
You're our friend,
and we need you

10:16.800 --> 10:18.100
for Battle of the Bands.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.533
- Sorry, but I honestly
don't think

10:20.533 --> 10:21.767
School of Rock is gonna win.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.833
I mean, look at us.

10:23.833 --> 10:25.433
We stumble through rehearsals.

10:25.433 --> 10:27.433
We waste our time.

10:27.433 --> 10:28.633
Our amp's on fire.

10:28.633 --> 10:33.067
- Was on fire.
Was.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.833
- Joining Night Lizard is
my best shot at winning.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.867
They're professionals.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.233
This is business, not personal.

10:40.233 --> 10:43.233
- What really matters
is sticking by each other

10:43.233 --> 10:45.367
and having fun.

10:45.367 --> 10:47.300
That's what makes
a good band great.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.533
- But none of your bands
have ever won.

10:49.533 --> 10:52.600
- That's because
they all kicked me out.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.200
You're making my point for me!

10:58.367 --> 11:00.067
Okay.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.767
I've called this emergency
after-school meeting

11:01.767 --> 11:04.167
to figure out how to
replace Zack for our audition.

11:04.167 --> 11:07.067
The answer is two words.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.067
- Animatronic bear?

11:08.067 --> 11:09.200
- Yeah, how'd you guess?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.700
- Hmm, because it's over there.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.100
And it's freaking me out!

11:14.200 --> 11:16.100
- I got him from Cheesy Chuck's.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.067
His name is Kodiak Joe.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.367
- * Kodiak Joe, Kodiak Joe

11:20.367 --> 11:23.267
* Hi-dee-ho, I'm Kodiak Joe *

11:23.267 --> 11:24.600
Hi, folks.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.367
I'm Kodiak Joe.

11:26.367 --> 11:30.200
Welcome to Cheesy Chuck's
Pizza Emporium.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.200
- Oh, right, I forgot.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.733
His activation word
is "Kodiak Joe."

11:35.733 --> 11:38.067
- * Kodiak Joe, Kodiak Joe

11:38.067 --> 11:40.433
* Hi-dee-ho, I'm Kodiak Joe *

11:40.433 --> 11:44.467
Did you know
you can get an extra large

11:44.467 --> 11:47.533
for just a dollar more?

11:47.533 --> 11:48.533
- [inaudible]

11:48.533 --> 11:49.533
- How did you get Kodi--

11:49.533 --> 11:50.833
- No!

11:50.833 --> 11:53.167
How did you get the bear?

11:53.167 --> 11:56.933
- He was in the dumpster
at Cheesy Chuck's.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.233
- Why were you in the dumpster?

11:58.233 --> 12:00.900
- Let's stay focused
on the bear.

12:00.900 --> 12:04.133
- That's the bear that mauled
some kids at a birthday party.

12:04.133 --> 12:06.433
We're in serious danger!

12:06.433 --> 12:09.767
- Maybe he did,
maybe he didn't.

12:09.767 --> 12:14.667
Point is, he's programmed
to play over 2,000 songs.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.367
And he's awesome.

12:17.367 --> 12:20.133
Guys, we're lucky
to have Kodiak Joe.

12:20.133 --> 12:22.500
- * Kodiak Joe, Kodiak Joe

12:22.500 --> 12:25.567
* Hi-dee-ho, I'm Kodiak Joe *

12:25.567 --> 12:30.067
You look like you want
a bear hug!

12:30.067 --> 12:31.633
- I don't want a bear hug!

12:31.633 --> 12:33.567
- Bear hug!
- Stay away from me!

12:33.567 --> 12:36.333
- Bear hug!
- It's her birthday!

12:36.333 --> 12:37.433
- Hey!

12:37.433 --> 12:38.633
- * Kodiak Joe,
Kodiak Joe *

12:38.633 --> 12:43.400
[slurs, winds down]

12:43.400 --> 12:46.067
- We shouldn't be
replacing Zack.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.500
We should be
trying to get him back.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.600
- Oh, I have a very
simple plan for that.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.733
Everybody, read this 50-page
report I wrote on Night Lizard.

12:53.733 --> 12:55.233
Also I made a checklist--

12:55.233 --> 12:56.933
- Summer, I know
you're trying to help,

12:56.933 --> 13:00.433
but maybe we could scale back
on the checklists and stuff.

13:00.433 --> 13:01.633
Just a little.

13:01.633 --> 13:02.800
- She's being nice.

13:02.800 --> 13:03.833
So let me translate.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.567
Please, no more!

13:06.567 --> 13:09.100
- What he said.

13:09.100 --> 13:12.167
- I've been trying to find
my place in this band forever.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.633
I can't play tambourine,
I cannot sing,

13:14.633 --> 13:16.267
and now
I can't make checklists?

13:16.267 --> 13:17.800
What am I supposed to do?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.367
- You could run our fan club.

13:19.367 --> 13:22.367
- We're a secret band.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.967
- Freddy and I
have a better plan.

13:23.967 --> 13:25.867
- Zack was lured to Night Lizard

13:25.867 --> 13:27.167
by that fancy presentation.

13:27.167 --> 13:28.400
All we have to do,

13:28.400 --> 13:30.133
is out-Night Lizard
Night Lizard.

13:30.133 --> 13:31.967
- Otherwise we're stuck
with Kodiak Joe.

13:31.967 --> 13:35.133
- [slurring]
* Kodiak Joe...

13:35.133 --> 13:36.767
[winding down]

13:36.767 --> 13:38.800
- I forgot the off word.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.800
It's a pizza topping.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.867
Pepperoni!
Sausage!

13:41.867 --> 13:43.067
Mushrooms!

13:43.067 --> 13:44.133
Green peppers!

13:44.133 --> 13:45.800
Save yourselves!

13:45.800 --> 13:49.233
Uh, ham!
Uh, green peppers!

13:49.233 --> 13:51.267
Please be pineapple!

13:51.267 --> 13:52.400
[Mr. Finn yelling]

13:52.400 --> 13:54.200
- Mr. Finn, are you okay?

13:54.200 --> 13:57.333
- I'm fine.
Look away, kids!

14:02.433 --> 14:04.667
- Zack, glad you're here.

14:04.667 --> 14:07.233
- It's 8:15.
I kind of have to be here.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.700
You know, for school and stuff.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.167
- We know
you're in Night Lizard now,

14:13.167 --> 14:15.067
but we wanted to show you
that School of Rock

14:15.067 --> 14:17.467
can be just as professional
as they are.

14:17.467 --> 14:20.867
- So professional that we wear
matching band jackets.

14:20.867 --> 14:23.633
- Wow, you have band jackets?

14:23.633 --> 14:24.767
I'm impressed.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.933
Oh.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.633
- If you rejoin
School of Rock,

14:28.633 --> 14:31.367
one of these sweet bad boys
is all yours.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.067
- Lawrence, we said
matching jackets.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.767
- My mom did the best
she could.

14:36.767 --> 14:40.167
That woman sacrificed her youth
and her looks for me.

14:40.167 --> 14:41.733
- Try yours on, Zack.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.767
- It's a little big.

14:48.767 --> 14:50.200
- Check your pocket, dude.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.900
- Pocket oatmeal?

14:55.900 --> 15:00.267
- There's raisins
in your other pocket.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.567
- All right, we go on second.

15:05.567 --> 15:07.367
We'd better get ready
to audition.

15:07.367 --> 15:09.167
- Mr. Finn, you said
when we got here

15:09.167 --> 15:10.267
we'd meet our new guitarist.

15:10.267 --> 15:11.767
- You've already met him.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.567
It's me!

15:13.567 --> 15:15.367
I'm gonna play
two guitars at once.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.333
- Have you ever
done that before?

15:17.333 --> 15:20.067
- No, but I was never
a substitute teacher before,

15:20.067 --> 15:21.900
and look at how great
that worked out.

15:21.900 --> 15:24.800
- We're dead.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.200
- Uh-oh.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.567
Where's my keyboard?

15:28.567 --> 15:31.967
- I put it on top of the van
for Freddy to load.

15:31.967 --> 15:34.167
Didn't you put it in the back?

15:37.467 --> 15:38.767
- I didn't load it.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.067
I was trying to find my drum.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.833
- It was also on top of the van!

15:46.533 --> 15:47.700
New rule.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.400
No leaving stuff
on top of the van.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.800
Where's Tomika?

15:58.767 --> 16:01.400
Oh, thank goodness.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.167
- We don't have a keyboard
or a drum.

16:03.167 --> 16:05.300
We can't audition
without them.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.900
- Summer, I know we asked you
to back off,

16:10.900 --> 16:12.233
but we were wrong.

16:12.233 --> 16:13.500
If there's anyone
who could help us

16:13.500 --> 16:15.233
get our act together,
it's you.

16:15.233 --> 16:16.400
- Are you saying...

16:16.400 --> 16:17.767
- Boss us around, girl!

16:17.767 --> 16:19.200
- That's
what I was hoping you'd say.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.100
Tomika, find me a pen and paper.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.300
I've got a checklist to make.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.800
Freddy, get the crate

16:23.800 --> 16:25.900
of vintage record albums
from Mr. Finn's van.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.400
- But those are priceless!

16:27.400 --> 16:29.133
- Lawrence, download
a picture of a cruise ship.

16:29.133 --> 16:30.433
- Why a--
- Just do it.

16:30.433 --> 16:31.800
- Okay.
- Mr. Finn?

16:31.800 --> 16:33.067
- I'm on it!

16:33.067 --> 16:35.067
- I didn't even tell you
what to do yet!

16:35.067 --> 16:36.900
- I'm already running.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.267
- If you let us
borrow your drum,

16:40.267 --> 16:43.133
we'll give you Mr. Finn's
Beatles' "White Album."

16:43.133 --> 16:44.833
Mint condition.

16:46.467 --> 16:49.900
- That was the first album
I ever bought.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.467
- Give it.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.700
- Can we just give them
Lawrence instead?

16:53.700 --> 16:55.500
Ow!

16:57.700 --> 16:58.900
- Did you hear?

16:58.900 --> 17:00.300
There's a ship
heading for shore,

17:00.300 --> 17:01.467
and the foghorns
aren't working.

17:01.467 --> 17:02.800
We need your keyboard.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.367
- Lives are at stake!

17:08.600 --> 17:12.167
- Keyboard, check.
Drum, check.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.767
- So we're done?

17:14.767 --> 17:16.433
- Not quite.

17:16.433 --> 17:18.967
There's one more thing.

17:18.967 --> 17:21.067
Hey, Zack, we're in trouble.

17:21.067 --> 17:23.067
We can't find our amp
and we're about to go on.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.500
Can we borrow yours?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.233
- No problem.
We don't go on till later.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.200
Right, Justin?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.533
- Wrong, Zack.

17:29.533 --> 17:31.400
We're not helping
the competition.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.767
We are here to win.

17:32.767 --> 17:34.933
It's called Battle of the Bands,

17:34.933 --> 17:38.500
not Fuzzy Snugglefest
of the Bands.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.967
- But they're my friends.

17:39.967 --> 17:41.100
- This is a business.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.600
We don't need friends.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.300
Really looking forward
to hearing you guys play.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.400
Oh, wait,
I won't be able to,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.333
because you don't have an amp.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.800
- Summer, get me a stool
I can stand on.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.267
I'm gonna make boots
out of his Night Lizard face.

17:56.267 --> 17:57.933
- [shrieks]

17:57.933 --> 18:00.367
- Down, girl.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.433
- Sorry, I wish
I could help you out.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.400
- We get it.
They're all business.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.600
We're your friends.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.833
We know that
you really want that trophy.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.533
But is winning like that
really worth it?

18:12.533 --> 18:16.067
- Next up, School of Rock.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.900
- That's us.
We better get back.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.167
- [whispers]
Yes.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.767
- Why are you smiling?
We didn't get an amp.

18:27.767 --> 18:28.733
- I lied.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.300
We had an amp
the whole time.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.933
That was just about
getting Zack back.

18:31.933 --> 18:34.433
I wanted him to see what his
new band-mates are really like.

18:34.433 --> 18:38.200
- Wow, you are good.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.433
- They're playing checkers.
I'm playing chess.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.767
- Note to self,
don't play chess with Summer.

18:49.267 --> 18:51.200

18:58.500 --> 19:00.700
- Dude, you sound terrible!

19:00.700 --> 19:04.067
- Are you sure it's me?
- Yes!

19:05.233 --> 19:06.500
- Let me just--

19:06.500 --> 19:08.667
[feedback]

19:08.667 --> 19:11.333
- All right, enough!
I can't take it anymore!

19:11.333 --> 19:13.167
School of Rock is out.

19:13.167 --> 19:15.667
- [sighs]

19:15.667 --> 19:17.567
- They're not going anywhere.

19:17.567 --> 19:19.833
Freddy, play us in.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.100
- But what about Night Lizard?

19:21.100 --> 19:22.200
- I quit, man.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.600
I'd rather lose with my friends

19:23.600 --> 19:25.133
than win with those jerks.

19:25.133 --> 19:27.567
- Sweet!

19:27.567 --> 19:29.533
But we're gonna win.

19:29.533 --> 19:31.233
- Let's have some fun with this.

19:31.233 --> 19:32.833
Freddy, take us in.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.867
- Whoo!

19:37.867 --> 19:43.067

dancing with my guy *

* But I know sometimes I

* Must get out in the light

* Better leave him behind

they're all right *

* And I know if I don't *

20:20.333 --> 20:23.333
* I'll go out of my mind *

20:23.333 --> 20:26.000

20:41.367 --> 20:43.900
- All right, stop.

20:45.733 --> 20:48.767
I can't believe
I'm saying this right now,

20:48.767 --> 20:50.933
but School of Rock is in!

20:50.933 --> 20:53.767
[cheering and applause]

20:53.767 --> 20:55.667
- That's what I'm talking about.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.133
- Yes!
- Yes!

20:57.133 --> 20:58.600
- We did it!
- Yes!

20:58.600 --> 21:01.300
- Well, I guess
I'll see you guys at school.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.833
- Where are you going?

21:03.833 --> 21:05.600
- I don't deserve
to be with you guys.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.300
A band is about
sticking by each other,

21:08.300 --> 21:10.533
and I didn't do that.

21:10.533 --> 21:12.600
- Dude, you were here for us
when we needed you.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.167
And you're family, Zack.

21:14.167 --> 21:15.867
We want you back.

21:15.867 --> 21:16.767
- Really?

21:16.767 --> 21:19.333
- Check your pocket, dude.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.567
- I'd rather not.

21:25.067 --> 21:27.067
You had the amp
the whole time, didn't you?

21:27.067 --> 21:30.433
- Yep, the only thing
we were missing was you.

21:30.433 --> 21:31.533
"Get Zack back."

21:31.533 --> 21:32.867
Check.

21:32.867 --> 21:35.067
- Thanks.

21:35.067 --> 21:38.167
- Hey, I'm gonna need a contact
person who isn't Dewey.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.100
- [sarcastic laughing]

21:40.100 --> 21:44.133
You can contact
our new band manager, Summer.

21:44.133 --> 21:45.667
- Wait, really?

21:45.667 --> 21:47.300
But you always say
that a band manager

21:47.300 --> 21:48.633
can make or break a band.

21:48.633 --> 21:49.867
- Then I can't think
of anyone better.

21:49.867 --> 21:51.933
- It's the perfect job for you.

21:51.933 --> 21:53.867
You're so calm, cool,
and collected.

21:53.867 --> 21:56.300
- I'm the band manager!
I'm the--I'm the band manager!

21:56.300 --> 21:58.667
I'm the band manager! I'm--oh,
my gosh, I'm the band manager!

21:58.667 --> 22:00.733
Yes, yes, yes!

22:00.733 --> 22:02.767
- Okay, band manager.

22:02.767 --> 22:05.600
Think you can manage to
get your band off my stage?

22:05.600 --> 22:08.200
- You heard the man.
Go, go, go, go!
