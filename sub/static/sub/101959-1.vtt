WEBVTT

00:20.730 --> 00:23.398
I still don't understand why we
have to wear these shirts, Tyra,

00:23.432 --> 00:24.767
and you don't.

00:24.801 --> 00:27.436
Suzanne, you've seen my boobs.

00:27.469 --> 00:30.505
They'll be a distraction
and this is Dee's moment.

00:30.539 --> 00:32.909
I still think askin' would
have been much easier.

00:32.942 --> 00:35.645
- Easy is boring.
- And we agreed to stick by her with this.

00:35.678 --> 00:38.447
So come on, Suzanne.
Get over it.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.250
Fine, but, Patty,
I still think you should still ask Jason.

00:42.284 --> 00:44.453
Jason's gonna say "no",
so why even bother?

00:44.486 --> 00:45.520
You don't know that.

00:45.554 --> 00:46.656
Okay, time check?

00:48.791 --> 00:51.393
It's now or never.
I'll grab the CD player.

01:03.538 --> 01:05.407
I can't do this,
you guys are crazy.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.543
I can't do... No, no, no.

01:12.649 --> 01:13.650
Hey, Henry.

01:55.858 --> 01:57.259
Will you go to prom with me?

01:58.594 --> 01:59.629
Um...

01:59.662 --> 02:01.263
What do you say?

02:06.969 --> 02:07.970
No.

02:08.871 --> 02:10.238
Your loss.

02:11.874 --> 02:12.975
Henry, you're a dick.

02:13.009 --> 02:15.912
And as a matter of fact,
I heard yours was small, too.

02:15.945 --> 02:16.946
Teeny.

02:23.886 --> 02:26.956
I still can't believe
we did that and he said no.

02:26.989 --> 02:29.424
I'm so sorry.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.728
That's exactly why
I am going with Paul Walker.

02:31.761 --> 02:33.663
And I'm going with Vin Diesel.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.031
I don't care that he said no.

02:35.064 --> 02:36.398
I gave it a shot

02:36.431 --> 02:38.868
and I'm going
with y'all anyways.

02:38.901 --> 02:41.503
Wait, I really need
to, um, use the restroom.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.706
I don't I'll make it at home.
I'll be back.

02:43.740 --> 02:44.741
Okay, hurry up.

02:48.945 --> 02:50.947
Does anyone wanna catch a movie?

02:50.980 --> 02:54.483
I can't. Back to back
dance classes and an audition.

02:54.516 --> 02:55.517
Maybe tomorrow?

02:56.652 --> 02:57.820
You come home with me.

02:57.854 --> 02:59.589
You can help me with me
with physics and crash with us.

02:59.622 --> 03:02.557
- Deal?
- Okay, deal.

03:02.592 --> 03:04.359
Even though that's
Tyra's subject.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.428
They are all Tyra's subjects.

03:06.461 --> 03:08.263
Speaking of, what is
taking her so long?

03:09.498 --> 03:10.967
Tyra. T.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.068
T, are you in here?

03:12.101 --> 03:14.737
Patty. Patty, my water broke.

03:15.204 --> 03:16.271
It's too early.

03:16.304 --> 03:18.507
- Oh, shit.
- I'm supposed to have another month.

03:18.540 --> 03:19.742
Okay, okay, calm down.

03:19.776 --> 03:21.376
- We'll figure this out.
- It hurts.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.045
- Okay.
- What the heck?

03:23.079 --> 03:24.680
What do you mean
your water broke?

03:24.714 --> 03:25.782
You're pregnant?

03:25.815 --> 03:27.750
And you knew? Did you?

03:29.585 --> 03:31.587
Run to my locker
and get my gym bag.

03:31.621 --> 03:33.656
- Dee-Dee, now!
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

03:33.689 --> 03:34.924
We need to go get help.

03:34.957 --> 03:36.793
No, no. No, please.

03:37.660 --> 03:39.061
I can't do this right now.

03:40.696 --> 03:43.032
We have to figure something out.
You're havin' a baby,

03:43.065 --> 03:44.867
so let's figure
this out like right now.

03:44.901 --> 03:46.102
There
is no figurin' this out.

03:46.135 --> 03:47.737
We have to go to the hospital.

03:47.770 --> 03:49.337
Wait, like you're
really pregnant?

03:49.371 --> 03:51.073
Having a baby?
But why didn't you tell us?

03:51.107 --> 03:52.842
We could have had
a baby shower and...

03:52.875 --> 03:54.342
You just shut up and help us!

03:54.376 --> 03:55.578
How could you be so stupid?

03:55.611 --> 03:58.513
I mean we graduate
in two months. Two!

03:58.547 --> 04:00.415
And, and you got
a scholarship to Caltech.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.449
What were you thinking?

04:01.483 --> 04:03.719
Look, Ms. Holier than thou,
this is our friend

04:03.753 --> 04:06.722
and she needs our help.
We stick together always.

04:06.756 --> 04:08.490
We have a pact, remember?

04:08.523 --> 04:09.892
I don't care
what you say, Patty.

04:09.926 --> 04:11.661
I'm going to get
Principal Hargrove.

04:11.694 --> 04:13.629
Suzanne, please.
I can't go to the hospital.

04:13.663 --> 04:16.833
Suzanne! Fuck you, Suzanne!

04:16.866 --> 04:19.902
- Patty. Patty, Patty.
- I know, I know.

04:19.936 --> 04:21.403
You thought you had more time.

04:22.071 --> 04:23.072
It's okay.

04:46.561 --> 04:48.530
- Hey.
- Uh.

04:48.563 --> 04:50.532
Sorry, I have to go, I'm late.

05:08.084 --> 05:10.620
Yeah, I know it,
it was due a week ago,

05:10.653 --> 05:12.121
I just need an extension.

05:14.090 --> 05:15.691
Yeah, I get paid on the 15th,

05:15.725 --> 05:17.360
so I can pay it
in full then. Yeah.

05:17.894 --> 05:19.061
Okay.

05:19.095 --> 05:24.066
Um, yes, I, I was
not late last month, so...

05:24.100 --> 05:25.868
Great, I appreciate that,
thank you.

05:28.004 --> 05:29.005
Oh, hey!

05:30.206 --> 05:32.108
Hi.

05:32.141 --> 05:34.210
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

05:34.243 --> 05:36.544
- I'm good.
- Good. Hey.

05:40.149 --> 05:41.684
Ready?

05:41.717 --> 05:43.853
Uh, she should be here
in just a second.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.688
She doesn't want us
to go in without her.

05:46.756 --> 05:48.124
- Patty.
- Yeah.

05:48.157 --> 05:50.159
I'm here, I'm here. Let's go.

06:12.648 --> 06:14.050
Okay, Max, I'm ready to go.

06:18.988 --> 06:21.190
You guys didn't have to come
back, I'm being discharged.

06:21.824 --> 06:22.825
Honey.

06:26.796 --> 06:27.797
What is it, Max?

06:30.967 --> 06:32.635
I called the girls
to come back here.

06:34.603 --> 06:35.604
I...

06:38.540 --> 06:39.541
We...

06:39.942 --> 06:40.943
You need help.

06:43.646 --> 06:46.015
You have a problem.

06:46.048 --> 06:48.516
I don't know how
to help you by myself anymore.

06:48.550 --> 06:49.685
I do not need help.

06:51.921 --> 06:53.589
I don't have a problem.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.658
You fell asleep
in the garage last week.

06:55.691 --> 06:56.692
Oh, my God.

06:57.226 --> 06:59.128
That was once.

06:59.161 --> 07:01.897
And besides, I have
a prescription for these pills.

07:01.931 --> 07:04.166
You hurt your back last year.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.836
You should not still be
takin' those pills, Tyra.

07:06.869 --> 07:09.638
Okay, well, Patrice,
you don't know my pain.

07:09.672 --> 07:13.109
Love, when one of my dancers on
tour hurt her ankle, she wasn't...

07:13.142 --> 07:15.711
Deidre, please stop
with the dance stories.

07:15.745 --> 07:18.714
Just... You guys, I am fine.

07:19.348 --> 07:21.650
I'm fine.

07:21.684 --> 07:26.155
You OD'd. People that OD
are not fine, Tyra.

07:26.188 --> 07:28.324
Okay, and I don't need
you to fix this, Patrice.

07:28.357 --> 07:30.593
But that seems to my job
when it comes to you.

07:39.902 --> 07:40.870
I took a pill.

07:40.903 --> 07:43.873
I took one pill
and I forgot that I took it

07:43.906 --> 07:46.108
and it...
I accidentally took another.

07:46.142 --> 07:47.542
It's not a big deal.

07:48.677 --> 07:49.779
That is so bullshit.

07:52.248 --> 07:54.283
It is bullshit
and you know it.

07:54.316 --> 07:55.985
No, you know what's
bullshit is you guys

07:56.018 --> 07:57.753
tryin' to come in here
and ambush me.

07:57.787 --> 07:59.088
- That's not what this is.
- No.

07:59.121 --> 08:00.189
Fuck off, Patrice.

08:00.222 --> 08:02.358
You can take your damn cape off.

08:02.391 --> 08:04.693
Max, please, get my doctor.

08:05.327 --> 08:07.029
I'm leaving.

08:07.063 --> 08:08.164
You know what?

08:09.331 --> 08:10.800
This was your idea, wasn't it?

08:11.634 --> 08:12.701
It was mine.

08:16.405 --> 08:17.339
Yours?

08:17.373 --> 08:19.975
Yep, Suzanne came down
from her ivory tower

08:20.009 --> 08:22.111
to make sure we took
care of this the right way.

08:23.345 --> 08:25.881
Castle Bend has an opening,
they will take you tonight.

08:25.915 --> 08:27.149
You need to go.

08:27.183 --> 08:28.984
- Baby.
- Stop.

08:29.919 --> 08:31.887
- Please.
- No, stop. Stop!

08:37.259 --> 08:39.361
Okay, yeah.
I... I see what this is.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.231
What is this, your atonement

08:42.264 --> 08:44.266
for your disappearing act
all these years?

08:46.302 --> 08:47.336
Yeah.

08:48.437 --> 08:49.638
I don't need this shit.

08:50.306 --> 08:51.373
I'm going home.

08:52.274 --> 08:53.776
With or without you, Max.

08:56.846 --> 08:57.847
Excuse me.

09:00.216 --> 09:01.217
Let her go.

09:05.721 --> 09:07.756
Mom,
you forgot we had practice.

09:08.357 --> 09:10.259
Again. Mom.

09:11.427 --> 09:14.063
Mom! Mom! Mom!

09:15.097 --> 09:17.433
Um, hello, 911?

09:17.466 --> 09:19.735
My mom is on the ground
and she's not breathing.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.871
Mom. Mom, please be okay, Mom!

09:22.171 --> 09:23.172
Mom!

09:29.145 --> 09:30.279
Jill. Jillian!

09:33.716 --> 09:35.050
Still think you don't need help?

09:37.186 --> 09:38.654
No, I got her, I got her.

09:46.395 --> 09:48.364
She's really not gonna come in?

09:48.397 --> 09:50.232
I think she just needs
a few more minutes.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.335
She doesn't wanna
stay with me either.

09:53.936 --> 09:54.937
I got her.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.740
Thank you.

10:07.917 --> 10:11.720
Um,
I'm gonna get out of here.

10:15.824 --> 10:16.859
Thank you.

10:18.494 --> 10:19.695
Bye, T.

10:38.447 --> 10:41.217
Hey, she's still in the car.
Everything okay?

10:41.250 --> 10:42.251
Yeah.

10:43.552 --> 10:46.388
You guys, this is...
This is a good idea.

10:46.422 --> 10:47.890
What are you even doin' here?

10:47.923 --> 10:49.992
- Patrice Anne, don't start.
- No, I wanna know.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.327
Why are you here?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.762
Are you here because this
is the right thing to do

10:53.796 --> 10:55.164
and Suzanne always
does the right thing?

10:55.197 --> 10:56.432
I'm here because
she's my friend.

10:56.465 --> 10:57.866
Friend, okay.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.401
We've seen you, what?

10:59.435 --> 11:01.870
Three times
in the last six years?

11:01.904 --> 11:04.139
I tried, you made it impossible.

11:04.173 --> 11:06.141
You didn't try hard enough.

11:07.509 --> 11:09.378
My car is leaving
in five minutes.

11:15.284 --> 11:17.786
- She'll come around.
- Hm.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.121
But she's right, I do miss you.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.523
I miss you, too.

11:21.557 --> 11:24.260
- We should get lunch or something you know, catch up.
- Yeah.

11:24.293 --> 11:26.161
I'm serious.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.797
Okay, well, give Trevor my love.

11:29.164 --> 11:30.199
I will.

12:50.412 --> 12:52.314
Checking out, fit.

12:52.348 --> 12:53.349
Sleep.

13:54.644 --> 13:57.614
So why didn't you tell me about
your, uh, your field trip?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.484
J.J., why did you
tell me just now?

14:04.286 --> 14:05.722
Phew.

14:05.755 --> 14:07.222
I asked you a question, J.J.

14:10.192 --> 14:13.028
Jackson Alexander Ellis, Jr.,

14:13.061 --> 14:14.563
shrugging, not an answer.

14:15.464 --> 14:17.566
They reminded us last week.

14:19.168 --> 14:21.136
Uh, and you're just
telling me this now?

14:22.104 --> 14:23.305
Where's the note?

14:23.338 --> 14:24.540
Yeah, ma.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.309
I forgot and I lost the note.

14:27.844 --> 14:30.647
Hm, okay, you forgot.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.481
Forgot what?

14:32.514 --> 14:36.385
I need to take $50 to camp
for the end of the summer trip.

14:36.418 --> 14:37.654
It's due today.

14:37.687 --> 14:40.222
And I was just telling your son
that he won't be able to go,

14:40.255 --> 14:42.291
because I don't have the money and
he shouldn't have waited so long.

14:42.324 --> 14:44.426
Uh, uh-uh, fix your face.

14:44.460 --> 14:45.461
I'll give it to him.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.466
No, you won't.
That's not the point, Jackson.

14:50.499 --> 14:52.434
Go grab your stuff,
so I can drop you off on my way home

14:52.468 --> 14:54.436
and no <i>Fortnite,</i> man,
none of that.

14:54.470 --> 14:56.104
I gotta be to work
at noon, okay?

14:56.138 --> 14:57.139
All right, hurry up.

14:58.808 --> 15:00.342
Thank you, sir.

15:02.679 --> 15:04.714
Excuse me.

15:07.049 --> 15:09.619
If you need some money, yo,
just let me know. I got you.

15:09.652 --> 15:11.220
We're fine.

15:11.253 --> 15:12.454
I wanna help, Dee.

15:12.488 --> 15:13.723
Jackson, I got it.

15:13.756 --> 15:14.757
I'm managing.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.461
Thanks for um,
staying with him last night.

15:19.495 --> 15:22.097
But you don't have to thank me
for taking care of my son.

15:24.099 --> 15:25.534
I could be
taking care of you, too.

15:26.068 --> 15:27.804
In more ways than one.

15:27.837 --> 15:29.338
- Did you...
- Yeah.

15:29.371 --> 15:32.441
You are relentless and stupid.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.209
Come on, babe.
You know you miss me.

15:34.243 --> 15:35.612
Admit it. Admit you miss me.

15:37.513 --> 15:39.147
- You know what I don't miss?
- Hm?

15:39.181 --> 15:41.383
Your listening skills,
the shoes. The shoes.

15:41.416 --> 15:43.185
You know, there's no
shoes in my house.

15:43.218 --> 15:46.823
Uh, my bad. That's on me,
I'm sorry.

15:46.856 --> 15:49.358
I got my stuff for Dad's, too.

15:49.391 --> 15:51.159
And yes, my bed is made.

15:52.361 --> 15:54.062
Thank you. Come here.

15:55.130 --> 15:58.567
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

15:58.601 --> 16:01.436
All right, look, uh,
we'll see you at the center on Friday

16:01.470 --> 16:04.072
and I love you.

16:04.106 --> 16:05.675
I love you, too.

16:05.708 --> 16:06.676
- All right, man.
- Bye.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.711
- What you smilin' about? Let's go.
- Have fun!

16:11.748 --> 16:12.749
Thank you.

16:15.785 --> 16:17.553
You could have made me
go home with Max,

16:18.320 --> 16:19.756
but you didn't.

16:19.789 --> 16:23.091
Sweet pea, Max is trying, too.

16:26.461 --> 16:28.665
Do you wanna tell me
why you are so angry with him?

16:30.198 --> 16:31.199
Nope.

16:34.671 --> 16:36.338
Do you wanna
talk about anything?

16:37.907 --> 16:39.107
Nope.

16:42.679 --> 16:44.112
Okay.

16:44.146 --> 16:46.716
Yes. Yeah, I do.

16:47.449 --> 16:48.450
Hm.

16:49.451 --> 16:50.452
Where were you?

16:52.287 --> 16:53.723
Jill, I didn't know.

16:53.756 --> 16:55.792
I mean why didn't you
tell me it got so bad?

16:57.694 --> 16:58.695
You know what?

16:59.662 --> 17:01.530
- Forget it.
- Jill!

17:01.563 --> 17:03.666
It's fine! I'm fine, okay?

17:31.393 --> 17:32.829
That appearance
gig fell through.

17:35.564 --> 17:37.566
Said they decided to go
with an active player.

17:39.234 --> 17:40.235
I'm sorry.

17:42.504 --> 17:43.840
Same shit.

17:45.507 --> 17:46.643
Every fucking day.

17:50.345 --> 17:53.281
I thought we agreed you would
sleep in the guest bedroom.

17:54.349 --> 17:56.318
I messed up.

17:56.351 --> 17:58.387
I apologize.
It ain't gonna happen again.

17:59.856 --> 18:01.958
Now, come on, I ain't
gonna sleep in a guest room

18:01.991 --> 18:03.558
in my own
fucking house, Suzanne.

18:06.663 --> 18:09.364
What do you think
about Katherine,

18:10.565 --> 18:12.300
after your mother,
for the baby's name?

18:15.872 --> 18:17.539
How about we name her Leslie?

18:19.274 --> 18:20.375
Or maybe Sara?

18:21.276 --> 18:22.344
Or Janice?

18:22.377 --> 18:23.613
Or, or Starr?

18:23.646 --> 18:25.347
- What about Starr, hm?
- Don't start, Suzanne.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.481
How do you like that?

18:26.515 --> 18:27.884
I mean they all sound like
really, really nice names.

18:27.917 --> 18:29.418
Maybe our daughter will chase

18:29.451 --> 18:31.353
after married football
players, too, hm?

18:32.487 --> 18:33.522
Fuck you, Suzanne.

18:33.555 --> 18:35.257
And you know what?

18:35.290 --> 18:37.794
Maybe, just maybe,
that football player

18:37.827 --> 18:39.595
will turn out to be
a lazy drunk, too.

18:39.629 --> 18:41.196
Well, maybe you
made me that way!

18:48.905 --> 18:51.339
Did you call that guy
about the real estate job yet?

18:53.042 --> 18:55.912
No, my knees hurt.

18:55.945 --> 18:57.747
Your knees have been
hurting for a year.

18:57.780 --> 18:59.615
That's what happens
when you play ball for 20 years.

18:59.649 --> 19:02.018
It is just always
a damn excuse with you.

19:02.051 --> 19:03.619
Well, we ain't
hurtin' for money.

19:03.653 --> 19:04.921
And who made sure of that?

19:07.422 --> 19:08.423
Ugh.

19:10.459 --> 19:12.829
<i>That's a
beautiful Friday morning to drive.</i>

19:22.672 --> 19:25.273
<i>Okay,
so I'm going on tour</i>

19:25.307 --> 19:28.044
<i>in the fall
and I need a choreographer.</i>

19:28.077 --> 19:31.581
I don't wanna hear it,
you are already approved if you want it.

19:31.614 --> 19:33.983
Look, you are
the best choreographer

19:34.016 --> 19:35.484
I've ever seen, ever,

19:35.517 --> 19:37.854
and you actually know
how to construct a show.

19:37.887 --> 19:39.689
So what do you say?

19:40.422 --> 19:41.490
Jo.

19:41.523 --> 19:42.625
Come on.

19:42.658 --> 19:45.360
First-class flights,
five-star hotels,

19:45.393 --> 19:48.030
a budget I should be
ashamed of, but I'm not.

19:48.064 --> 19:50.265
And Barcelona.

19:51.033 --> 19:53.401
Barcelona? My last city.

19:53.435 --> 19:55.370
Dee, it will be like old times.

19:59.742 --> 20:01.309
Hey, thanks for coverin' for me.

20:01.343 --> 20:02.211
- Anything crazy?
- Nope.

20:02.245 --> 20:03.713
Oh, Michael actually
showed up on time.

20:03.746 --> 20:05.681
Oh, that's two weeks in a row.

20:05.715 --> 20:08.416
I know. He would never admit it,
but he likes it here.

20:11.954 --> 20:13.990
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what's up, everybody?

20:14.023 --> 20:16.659
Stand on up. Let's get on up.

20:16.692 --> 20:18.326
Good afternoon, Miss Dee.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.762
Afternoon, Cecelia.

20:20.630 --> 20:21.998
Okay, who can show me part

20:22.031 --> 20:23.666
of the dance we've
worked on so far?

20:26.803 --> 20:29.371
Michael, you can show us
after we warm-up.

20:29.404 --> 20:31.874
- Yo, my hand wasn't even up.
- I know.

20:31.908 --> 20:34.476
All right, everybody, on the
floor, start to warm up, okay?

20:36.579 --> 20:38.346
- Hi.
- Hi. You made it.

20:38.380 --> 20:41.584
Hey, yeah. Auntie Patty said
that I had to come, so I'm here.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.119
Right, come on,
love bug, join us.

20:43.152 --> 20:44.486
Wait, you mean
I have to participate?

20:44.519 --> 20:47.857
Oh, yeah. What did you think you
were gonna do? Just stand around?

20:47.890 --> 20:50.626
No, that's not fun,
we're dancing.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.628
Oh, no,
I, I don't dance, Auntie.

20:52.662 --> 20:54.529
Look, neither did
I when I first started.

20:54.563 --> 20:56.531
Just do your best,
no judgment zone.

20:56.565 --> 20:57.900
- Uh...
- It's gonna be fun.

20:57.934 --> 21:00.903
Hey, Cecelia, would you
mind showing her around?

21:00.937 --> 21:02.537
- Sure thing, Miss Dee.
- Thank you.

21:02.571 --> 21:03.706
Follow me.

21:05.174 --> 21:06.676
You'll be good, you'll be good.

21:08.711 --> 21:11.681
Hey, uh, Matt Grayson
has a sick deep ball.

21:29.564 --> 21:30.565
Thank you.

21:34.569 --> 21:36.138
Now, you're gonna
go down the hall

21:36.172 --> 21:37.539
to the room on the right.

21:42.912 --> 21:45.648
Group, we have
a new member today.

21:46.949 --> 21:48.516
Please welcome Tyra.

21:48.550 --> 21:49.919
- Hey, Tyra.
- Hi, Tyra.

21:51.153 --> 21:52.788
All right, gang,
let's begin.

21:53.923 --> 21:56.058
So who took a moment
to write down...

21:57.392 --> 22:01.097
What it felt like the first time
the first time they got high?

22:01.731 --> 22:04.466
Anybody, anybody? Anybody?

22:04.499 --> 22:07.003
Ah, Elaine,
go first, my darling.

22:07.036 --> 22:09.471
I mean I didn't write it down,

22:09.504 --> 22:11.539
but I remember it
like it was yesterday.

22:11.573 --> 22:13.843
Go ahead, yeah.

22:14.509 --> 22:15.611
Um...

22:16.612 --> 22:18.614
I remember feeling like...

22:18.648 --> 22:20.182
the world was closing in on me,

22:21.483 --> 22:23.853
and I was living in a black hole

22:23.886 --> 22:25.487
that was swallowing me whole.

22:27.123 --> 22:28.224
I mean, I couldn't
take it anymore.

22:28.257 --> 22:29.191
The baby wouldn't stop crying,

22:29.225 --> 22:31.459
the bill collectors
wouldn't stop calling.

22:34.163 --> 22:35.865
A buddy of mine
used to get high.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.969
And I lit the pipe...

22:41.637 --> 22:43.205
and for a brief second it felt

22:43.239 --> 22:45.775
like everything around me
went silent

22:46.809 --> 22:47.944
and I could finally see

22:47.977 --> 22:49.845
a sliver of light
at the end of the tunnel.

22:53.983 --> 22:55.851
And then my high came down,

22:55.885 --> 22:57.787
and boy, was it a bitch.

23:00.856 --> 23:02.024
Wow.

23:02.058 --> 23:03.826
Thank you, Elaine.
I appreciate that.

23:05.161 --> 23:07.897
Anybody else?

23:07.930 --> 23:08.998
You guys
are awfully quiet today.

23:09.031 --> 23:11.566
Come on now, what's up?
Come on, come on, come on.

23:13.568 --> 23:14.837
Tyra.

23:15.537 --> 23:16.772
Tyra?

23:22.878 --> 23:23.913
Tyra.

23:23.946 --> 23:25.915
Therapy is a part
of the process.

23:25.948 --> 23:27.116
But I don't need to be
in this process,

23:27.149 --> 23:28.250
that's what
everybody doesn't get.

23:28.284 --> 23:29.585
But you're here.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.120
You know what?

23:31.988 --> 23:33.823
I am not a junkie.

23:33.856 --> 23:35.157
Occasionally, I take a pill,

23:35.191 --> 23:36.859
but you know what?
I have a prescription for those.

23:36.892 --> 23:38.928
That does not make me like them.

23:38.961 --> 23:40.029
And let me tell you
something else,

23:40.062 --> 23:41.230
because you don't know me.

23:41.263 --> 23:42.765
I graduated top of my class,

23:42.798 --> 23:44.200
I went to Caltech
on a full scholarship.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.533
I did all of that.

23:45.567 --> 23:46.602
I did that with a kid.

23:47.670 --> 23:49.537
Okay? So I'm not
going to sit here

23:49.571 --> 23:52.608
and listen to people,
who actually are really addicts,

23:52.641 --> 23:53.743
share their issues.

23:54.810 --> 23:55.811
It's not for me.

24:04.053 --> 24:05.888
Hey, I want to check myself out.

24:05.921 --> 24:07.289
You can't.

24:07.323 --> 24:09.225
I so fucking can.
I came here voluntarily.

24:09.258 --> 24:11.559
But you signed a form that said
your husband is the only one

24:11.594 --> 24:12.762
that can sign you out.

24:16.766 --> 24:18.566
Sometimes I think
I should have been able

24:18.601 --> 24:20.803
- to prevent all this.
- Why?

24:20.836 --> 24:23.305
Because you see addicts
everyday on the peds floor?

24:23.339 --> 24:24.974
No, the truth is

24:25.007 --> 24:27.610
if someone doesn't believe
that they need help,

24:27.643 --> 24:30.579
then all the people in the world
won't be able to help them.

24:30.613 --> 24:32.681
You gotta stop
blaming yourself for things

24:32.715 --> 24:34.283
that are completely
out of your control.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.321
Thank you for listening.

24:39.355 --> 24:43.993
And, I'm sure this not how
you wanted to spend your break.

24:44.026 --> 24:45.928
It's the only way I want
to spend my breaks.

24:49.632 --> 24:51.767
Come on, are we going
to do this again?

24:51.801 --> 24:52.935
I know we had fun.

24:55.204 --> 24:56.739
We did, but...

24:56.772 --> 24:58.274
"But"? No, no "buts."

24:59.141 --> 25:00.176
All right.

25:00.209 --> 25:02.278
Don't dash a brother's spirits.

25:02.311 --> 25:04.246
All right, you pick the date,
you pick the time,

25:04.280 --> 25:06.015
and I will be there.

25:06.048 --> 25:07.249
Patients be damned.

25:08.684 --> 25:10.352
So you are willing
to just let folks die

25:10.386 --> 25:11.620
to have dinner with me again?

25:11.654 --> 25:13.689
Code blue
all night just for you.

25:14.990 --> 25:16.292
You're a horrible doctor.

25:16.325 --> 25:17.660
Yes, I am.

25:18.961 --> 25:19.962
Okay.

25:20.896 --> 25:22.164
We can go out again.

25:23.232 --> 25:25.935
You check your schedule,
I'll check mine, and...

25:27.103 --> 25:28.838
- Okay.
- Dr. Jordans.

25:30.272 --> 25:31.307
Yeah.

25:31.340 --> 25:32.675
Yeah, I'll be right there.

25:33.175 --> 25:34.176
You promised.

25:38.314 --> 25:39.915
What are you guys
having for lunch?

25:53.796 --> 25:55.364
Take a break. Lunch time.

26:01.804 --> 26:02.638
Hi.

26:02.671 --> 26:04.373
- Hey.
- I'll be back in an hour.

26:25.828 --> 26:27.196
Thank you.

26:27.631 --> 26:28.831
You're welcome.

26:32.201 --> 26:34.336
Sent you
a few messages yesterday.

26:35.337 --> 26:36.772
You never got back to me.

26:37.907 --> 26:39.308
I know. I got them.

26:40.743 --> 26:41.977
You know, avoiding my calls,

26:42.011 --> 26:43.679
isn't going to make me
go away, Suzanne.

26:53.422 --> 26:54.423
How's your friend?

26:55.357 --> 26:56.959
She decided to go to rehab.

26:58.194 --> 26:59.795
So we'll see if it works out.

27:02.064 --> 27:03.199
I miss you.

27:20.549 --> 27:22.885
I miss you.

27:24.253 --> 27:25.254
Carl.

27:26.922 --> 27:27.923
Carl, I...

27:30.960 --> 27:31.961
I love you.

27:38.167 --> 27:40.436
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

27:40.469 --> 27:41.870
I can't. Stop.

27:50.580 --> 27:52.047
This is bullshit, Suzanne.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.383
I can't do this today.

27:54.416 --> 27:56.051
I wanna be with you,

27:57.419 --> 27:59.455
but not like this.
Him or me, but not both.

27:59.488 --> 28:01.123
I made a commitment, Carl.

28:01.156 --> 28:02.391
Yes.

28:02.424 --> 28:03.826
You did. You made a commitment

28:03.859 --> 28:05.894
under completely
different circumstances.

28:07.329 --> 28:10.199
You don't deserve to be happy?

28:10.232 --> 28:14.136
There is a whole other person
that I have to think about now.

28:14.169 --> 28:16.538
I do not want to be
a single mother.

28:19.842 --> 28:21.110
Who said you had to be?

28:23.979 --> 28:25.414
It's not the same, Carl.

28:27.216 --> 28:29.852
My whole life,
I have done everything right.

28:29.885 --> 28:33.355
I went to college, I met a guy,
I fell in love, I said, "I do."

28:33.389 --> 28:36.358
Why would you suddenly
expect me to do it wrong?

28:39.261 --> 28:40.529
What has doing it right
gotten you?

28:47.336 --> 28:49.438
And just so you know,

28:49.471 --> 28:51.407
you sticking around
and having his baby,

28:53.075 --> 28:54.510
it's not going
to make you love him.

28:59.148 --> 29:00.983
And... Yeah, I'm...

29:01.950 --> 29:04.353
I'm gonna willfully step back.

29:06.656 --> 29:08.490
- What?
- Yeah.

29:10.660 --> 29:11.860
I want more.

29:13.596 --> 29:14.963
Can you honestly give me that?

29:17.132 --> 29:18.334
Yeah, that's what I thought.

29:20.969 --> 29:21.970
I'm out.

29:24.540 --> 29:25.541
Carl.

29:31.914 --> 29:33.282
- You have a pen?
- Yeah.

29:39.288 --> 29:41.990
All right. Good bye, Michael.

29:42.024 --> 29:44.326
Hey, I said,
"Good bye, Michael."

29:44.360 --> 29:45.994
All right, yeah.

29:46.028 --> 29:47.262
Peace, Ms. Dee.

29:47.296 --> 29:49.965
Hey, Michael, remember, you...

29:49.998 --> 29:51.500
"Are not
my circumstances," yeah.

29:51.533 --> 29:53.302
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

30:00.242 --> 30:03.580
Hey, have you ever seen
this high school shit?

30:04.413 --> 30:05.648
- Grayson?
- Yeah.

30:07.049 --> 30:08.951
Yeah, like all of it.

30:08.984 --> 30:10.486
All right. That's dope.

30:12.187 --> 30:13.989
Yeah.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.958
All right. Um, I'll catch you.

30:17.459 --> 30:18.460
Bye.

30:26.502 --> 30:27.936
You did well today.

30:27.970 --> 30:30.939
- Uh, cool.
- Great.

30:30.973 --> 30:33.409
I was going to have you
make you help me sweep,

30:33.442 --> 30:35.944
- but it's all right.
- I can grab it.

30:38.715 --> 30:40.382
You know what?

30:40.416 --> 30:43.185
Why don't you take
my summer workshop?

30:44.153 --> 30:45.053
Just three days a week.

30:45.087 --> 30:47.089
Not a bad way
to spend some time, right?

30:47.624 --> 30:49.626
- Sure. Okay.
- Cool.

30:51.293 --> 30:52.928
Um, Michael?

30:53.696 --> 30:55.030
Yeah, what about Michael?

30:55.063 --> 30:56.465
- Jillian!
- Nothing.

30:56.498 --> 30:58.367
Hey, what's up, favorite dude?

30:58.400 --> 30:59.736
- Never mind.
- I missed you.

30:59.769 --> 31:02.004
You haven't been over
in a while.

31:02.037 --> 31:03.673
I got the illest new game today!

31:03.706 --> 31:05.140
- Really?
- Yeah!

31:05.174 --> 31:07.342
Okay, so why don't we ask Auntie
Patty if you can come over tonight?

31:07.376 --> 31:09.378
I'll beat you in <i>Madden,</i>
but like not too bad.

31:09.411 --> 31:11.113
Huh, you never win.

31:11.146 --> 31:12.114
- Oh?
- I got this.

31:12.147 --> 31:14.149
- Okay, in your dreams.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

31:14.183 --> 31:15.551
Ma'am, I was looking
for Jillian.

31:15.585 --> 31:16.786
She used to be about this big,

31:16.820 --> 31:19.021
she used to slobber on herself
all the time. I think you...

31:19.054 --> 31:20.088
- Okay.
- Come here.

31:20.122 --> 31:21.658
- Hi, Uncle Jack.
- What's going on?

31:21.691 --> 31:22.625
Good to see you.

31:22.659 --> 31:24.594
I'm almost done here.
Help me out.

31:25.728 --> 31:27.262
I could take you out to dinner,

31:27.296 --> 31:28.698
you know,
if you don't have plans.

31:28.731 --> 31:31.366
- Jackson.
- It's one dinner.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.469
Yeah, Ma, it's one dinner.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.137
Wow.

31:38.307 --> 31:40.542
You actually ate Indian food.

31:40.576 --> 31:41.510
Uh, yes.

31:41.543 --> 31:43.646
It was definitely different.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.381
Well, not as good as
what I had in Mumbai, but...

31:46.415 --> 31:48.050
I'll have to take
your word for it.

31:50.653 --> 31:53.222
So you want to come in
for some tea?

31:53.255 --> 31:56.024
Unless you have other plans
or whatever.

31:56.793 --> 31:58.293
I can stay.

31:58.327 --> 31:59.328
Good.

32:00.195 --> 32:01.463
Take off your shoes.

32:01.497 --> 32:03.365
Oh, got other plans.

32:04.399 --> 32:06.201
Oh, my God. Please.

32:06.235 --> 32:08.036
Oh, please.

32:08.070 --> 32:10.339
Oh, that apartment
was the worst.

32:10.372 --> 32:13.075
One room
and a makeshift bathroom.

32:13.108 --> 32:14.711
That's...
How did that even happen?

32:14.744 --> 32:18.113
And walls so thin you could hear
when our neighbors took a shit.

32:18.146 --> 32:20.583
- It was like...
- Oh, I can still it hear it now.

32:20.617 --> 32:22.351
Oh, God forbid
they were having sex.

32:22.384 --> 32:23.285
No, and you know what?

32:23.318 --> 32:25.487
No, we had them beat
in that department.

32:25.521 --> 32:26.756
We had them beat.

32:30.125 --> 32:32.461
But you know the thing I miss
the most about that dump?

32:34.396 --> 32:35.397
We were together.

32:36.833 --> 32:39.301
I mean, I would sit there
on that futon

32:39.334 --> 32:41.470
just watching you dance,
and I'd just be like,

32:41.503 --> 32:43.505
"Yo, this is life."

32:44.774 --> 32:47.242
Then J.J. came
and everything was complete.

32:48.477 --> 32:49.846
We had a family.

32:49.879 --> 32:52.447
Yeah, but that
was all you wanted.

32:54.149 --> 32:55.317
And another baby.

32:56.552 --> 32:58.487
You told me,
"Your dreams are killing us,"

32:58.520 --> 32:59.856
and you walked out the door.

32:59.889 --> 33:02.190
I did. I did.

33:02.224 --> 33:03.793
Babe, I came all the way
out here just to show you

33:03.826 --> 33:05.828
how much I know
that I fucked up.

33:08.698 --> 33:10.365
I just want another chance.

33:12.534 --> 33:13.636
I want this to work.

33:31.386 --> 33:32.822
You usually used to go that way.

33:32.855 --> 33:33.957
Is that... Okay, I mean...

33:33.990 --> 33:35.692
- I mean, it doesn't matter.
- It has been six years.

33:35.725 --> 33:37.259
Let me just...
Oh, fuck it, come.

33:37.292 --> 33:38.393
Just go, just go.

34:56.405 --> 34:58.573
I've done majors
that nobody did.

34:58.608 --> 34:59.742
Look at that!

35:00.175 --> 35:01.978
What you doing?

35:02.011 --> 35:03.178
- Get out!
- Yo, yo, hold up.

35:03.211 --> 35:07.817
Get the fuck out of my house,
you dirty fucking bastard!

35:07.850 --> 35:09.619
In my bed!

35:09.652 --> 35:12.320
- In my fucking bed!
- Calm... No!

35:12.354 --> 35:14.657
What the fuck!
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

35:14.691 --> 35:16.358
- Get out!
- Fine!

35:18.326 --> 35:19.796
But this is my goddamn house.

35:24.533 --> 35:26.268
What you going to do
when I leave, huh?

35:27.737 --> 35:29.639
Your perfect little world
will be shattered.

35:30.807 --> 35:32.842
Not like you got
any friends anyway.

36:14.549 --> 36:16.652
Tyra, your husband is here
to see you.

36:20.857 --> 36:21.858
No.

36:41.376 --> 36:42.945
So, is this gonna be
another 50 minutes

36:42.979 --> 36:44.346
of me watching you?

36:46.414 --> 36:47.482
I'm here.

36:48.350 --> 36:49.351
You are.

36:54.690 --> 36:56.826
There are
some questions in here.

36:57.927 --> 36:58.928
Take a look at them.

37:00.129 --> 37:01.931
Fill them out
if you feel like it.

37:05.101 --> 37:06.301
See you tomorrow.

37:38.533 --> 37:39.568
You look nice.

37:39.602 --> 37:40.837
Thank you, sweet pea.

37:42.004 --> 37:43.338
Max called.

37:44.173 --> 37:45.908
He said
you won't answer his calls.

37:46.976 --> 37:48.978
I don't want to talk to him.

37:49.011 --> 37:51.914
And I don't want to go to that
stupid family day either.

37:51.948 --> 37:53.983
Jill, it's been a few weeks,

37:54.016 --> 37:56.484
I think your mom
would really like to see you.

37:57.053 --> 37:58.054
I guess.

38:01.724 --> 38:04.126
Okay.
Tell me about the center.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.494
- Making any friends?
- One.

38:07.029 --> 38:08.998
I guess, yeah.

38:09.031 --> 38:10.766
- It's cool.
- Yeah.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.702
I guess that would be Michael.

38:12.735 --> 38:14.937
Okay, Auntie Dee-Dee
talks too much.

38:14.971 --> 38:15.872
- She really does.
- Yeah.

38:15.905 --> 38:17.073
She can't keep a secret.

38:17.106 --> 38:18.908
Oh.

38:18.941 --> 38:19.976
Damn.

38:20.009 --> 38:21.777
Uh, he's right on time.

38:21.811 --> 38:22.745
- That...
- He is.

38:22.778 --> 38:24.146
- Is that good or... That's good?
- I think so.

38:24.180 --> 38:25.447
- I think so.
- Okay.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.883
Oh God. Okay.

38:26.916 --> 38:28.516
Well, let me go get that
before he thinks

38:28.550 --> 38:29.619
that you stood him up.

38:29.652 --> 38:30.653
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:31.453 --> 38:32.755
- Jill?
- Mm-hm?

38:32.788 --> 38:33.923
I love you.

38:33.956 --> 38:35.390
More than anything.

38:36.225 --> 38:37.860
Are you serious? No, no, no.

38:37.894 --> 38:38.995
No way. He is not the best.

38:39.028 --> 38:40.796
If there were one minute left
in the fourth quarter

38:40.830 --> 38:42.965
and no timeouts,
I want Grayson all day.

38:42.999 --> 38:44.700
Okay, he is like so cool
under pressure.

38:44.734 --> 38:47.003
Look, how are you gonna argue
with five Super Bowl rings?

38:47.036 --> 38:49.005
Simple. A good coach and luck.

38:49.038 --> 38:49.872
- Luck?
- Uh-huh.

38:49.906 --> 38:51.140
That's all you are going
to give the man?

38:51.173 --> 38:53.441
Yeah. Week three, last season.

38:53.475 --> 38:54.744
I rest my case.

39:01.150 --> 39:02.151
Wow.

39:04.620 --> 39:05.855
You look great.

39:05.888 --> 39:07.023
Thank you.

39:08.157 --> 39:09.825
Shall we go?

39:09.859 --> 39:10.960
This is nice.

39:12.228 --> 39:13.629
What?

39:13.663 --> 39:16.065
You, me, here, again.

39:17.900 --> 39:19.068
You not running.

39:19.936 --> 39:21.170
I don't run,

39:21.203 --> 39:23.873
I jog briskly.

39:23.906 --> 39:25.207
Briskly, right?

39:26.108 --> 39:27.109
You got jokes.

39:33.548 --> 39:34.684
So tell me.

39:34.717 --> 39:36.118
What is it that you want?

39:36.819 --> 39:37.987
What do you mean?

39:38.553 --> 39:39.855
You know, out of life.

39:40.890 --> 39:42.758
Your dreams? Your desires?

39:45.261 --> 39:46.461
Oh.

39:48.164 --> 39:49.265
Did I say something wrong?

39:49.298 --> 39:50.733
No. Um...

39:52.567 --> 39:56.205
Just... I haven't
thought about it in years.

39:56.238 --> 39:59.875
Me and my girlfriends
used to sit around for hours

39:59.909 --> 40:02.078
and plot out our lives.

40:02.111 --> 40:04.947
I mean down to the color
of our bridesmaid dresses.

40:06.816 --> 40:09.618
Seems like a lifetime ago.
So much has changed.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.921
For the good or bad?

40:13.656 --> 40:15.157
Depends on who you ask.

40:16.993 --> 40:19.161
Suzanne came the closest.

40:19.195 --> 40:20.562
She married the NFL star

40:20.596 --> 40:22.465
and got the life
she always dreamed of.

40:24.066 --> 40:25.067
And you?

40:27.003 --> 40:28.904
I stopped dreaming
a long time ago.

40:29.705 --> 40:31.807
Packed them up
with my ex-husband.

40:33.042 --> 40:34.576
That's the way you wanna live?

40:37.246 --> 40:38.247
Works for me.

40:40.950 --> 40:41.951
Okay.

40:46.022 --> 40:49.158
I had a wonderful
night tonight.

40:50.760 --> 40:51.827
- So did I.
- Hm?

40:51.861 --> 40:52.995
Mm-hm.

40:53.029 --> 40:55.264
I know you're not going
to make me beg

40:55.297 --> 40:56.899
to take you out again, right?

40:57.967 --> 41:00.703
No, we can work on that.

41:00.736 --> 41:01.737
Okay.

41:02.705 --> 41:04.807
I'm going to get going now.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.675
I'm on call tomorrow, so...

41:06.709 --> 41:07.710
Okay.

41:09.111 --> 41:11.213
Please let me know
that you made it.

41:21.223 --> 41:23.793
You let me know
you made it home, okay?

41:25.261 --> 41:26.929
- I will.
- Okay.

41:26.962 --> 41:28.597
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:46.015 --> 41:47.583
Yeah.

41:58.027 --> 42:00.229
Why you always wearing
some football shit?

42:01.964 --> 42:04.967
Yo, maybe because
she likes it, Cecelia.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.303
Yo, why you gotta be
such a bitch?

42:07.336 --> 42:09.405
Listen here, felon,

42:09.438 --> 42:12.007
- don't be calling me no bitch.
- You know, I ain't no felon, Cecelia.

42:12.041 --> 42:13.042
Hey, just...

42:14.310 --> 42:16.312
You better listen to the girl.

42:16.345 --> 42:17.813
You don't want another strike.

42:24.687 --> 42:25.688
Why did you do that?

42:37.867 --> 42:39.335
Thank you for meeting me here.

42:39.368 --> 42:40.436
- Oh, no.
- I just couldn't get away.

42:40.469 --> 42:42.938
It's no problem.

42:42.972 --> 42:46.308
It's actually...
It's really cool what you do here.

42:46.342 --> 42:49.311
Thank you. I mean. it's not
what I planned on doing,

42:49.345 --> 42:50.746
but, you know?

42:51.581 --> 42:53.816
- Pregnancy looks good on you.
- No.

42:53.849 --> 42:55.084
Is Trevor excited?

42:55.784 --> 42:57.052
Oh, yeah.

42:57.086 --> 42:58.254
Yeah, you know? I guess.

43:00.322 --> 43:01.323
Sit.

43:08.230 --> 43:09.231
All right.

43:12.168 --> 43:13.369
Spill.

43:15.938 --> 43:17.139
Go on, talk to me.

43:22.978 --> 43:24.914
Uh, we're friends, right?

43:24.947 --> 43:25.948
Yes.

43:31.854 --> 43:33.122
I'm miserable.

43:34.089 --> 43:35.724
Dee, I am...

43:38.294 --> 43:42.398
I am just completely
and utterly miserable.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.201
I mean...

43:47.002 --> 43:48.470
My marriage is just...

43:50.940 --> 43:51.941
It's a joke.

43:53.375 --> 43:56.078
And, I think I'm in love
with this other man,

43:56.111 --> 43:58.013
but I can't have him
because of this...

43:59.448 --> 44:01.750
f'd up situation, so...

44:02.885 --> 44:04.320
Oh, I wasn't expecting that.

44:08.958 --> 44:10.926
Trevor has just

44:10.960 --> 44:13.996
cheated on me more times
than I can count

44:14.029 --> 44:16.532
and I have stayed with him

44:16.565 --> 44:20.502
because that is what women
are supposed to do, right?

44:20.536 --> 44:23.872
And I keep...
I keep telling myself,

44:23.906 --> 44:26.208
"It'll get better" and...

44:26.242 --> 44:27.776
- It never does.
- No.

44:28.377 --> 44:29.778
No.

44:31.146 --> 44:34.149
And then this baby...

44:35.851 --> 44:39.154
this baby was just
a drunken weekend of us

44:39.188 --> 44:40.489
attempting to try again,

44:41.123 --> 44:43.325
again.

44:43.359 --> 44:45.961
And I... I...
I couldn't get rid of it. I mean...

44:46.996 --> 44:49.465
A baby wasn't high on my list,

44:49.498 --> 44:51.133
but it's a baby and...

44:53.302 --> 44:55.471
I'm supposed
to want to be a mom, right?

44:56.606 --> 44:58.274
You're supposed
to want what you want.

44:59.508 --> 45:00.909
There's no rules.

45:05.147 --> 45:07.283
God, I don't even know
what that means anymore.

45:08.384 --> 45:10.019
To want what I want. I don't...

45:13.989 --> 45:15.524
I'm sorry,
I have been talking too much.

45:15.557 --> 45:17.059
No. No. No.

45:20.362 --> 45:21.363
Come back.

45:24.033 --> 45:25.267
You need us.

45:26.435 --> 45:29.238
We need you.

45:29.271 --> 45:32.541
And I know you and Patty
have your... your friction,

45:32.574 --> 45:35.544
those little digs or whatever,

45:35.577 --> 45:39.448
but you're really two
sides of the same coin.

45:39.481 --> 45:41.950
Everything is right or wrong,
black and white.

45:44.386 --> 45:46.221
Life is a whole lot of gray.

45:53.262 --> 45:55.531
- Will you eat something for me, please?
- Yes.

45:55.564 --> 45:56.932
Thanks.

45:56.965 --> 45:58.233
- Yeah.
- Here.

46:54.657 --> 46:56.392
So this is, uh...

46:57.594 --> 46:59.261
where I've been staying.

47:02.164 --> 47:04.533
- Well, you look better, T.
- Hm.

47:04.566 --> 47:06.435
Thank you. Thank you.

47:07.035 --> 47:09.004
The food here is terrible.

47:11.173 --> 47:14.143
But they are
treating you right, right?

47:14.176 --> 47:16.211
Yes, Patty.

47:16.245 --> 47:18.147
No need to beat anyone up.

47:25.755 --> 47:28.357
Um, Jillian's been taking
my dance classes,

47:28.390 --> 47:30.125
she's really good.

47:30.159 --> 47:31.427
She really has a natural talent.

47:32.528 --> 47:34.029
Is that right?

47:37.232 --> 47:38.400
Jillian.

47:43.238 --> 47:44.406
Sorry.

47:47.476 --> 47:48.611
Yeah.

47:50.312 --> 47:51.681
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

47:53.515 --> 47:54.617
Jillian.

47:58.387 --> 48:01.290
Don't go gettin' disrespectful
just 'cause I'm not home.

48:01.323 --> 48:04.226
As soon I get home, things are gonna
go back to the way that they were

48:04.259 --> 48:05.628
and this little blip
will be over before you know it.

48:05.662 --> 48:06.729
Blip?

48:08.530 --> 48:11.601
No. No, see, this is exactly
why I didn't wanna come here.

48:11.634 --> 48:13.268
Okay, Mom,
this wasn't just a blip.

48:13.302 --> 48:15.170
I had to give you
mouth to mouth!

48:15.204 --> 48:17.640
You pop pill after pill, after
pill, after pill and I see you!

48:17.674 --> 48:19.642
- Don't talk... Just stop it!
- Oh, no.

48:19.676 --> 48:22.010
Goddammit, Tyra.
What is your problem?

48:22.044 --> 48:24.279
- I'm sorry.
- She didn't deserve that.

48:24.313 --> 48:26.716
- She doesn't deserve any of this.
- Oh, I didn't mean to.

48:26.749 --> 48:28.450
She wants to be mad, dammit.

48:28.484 --> 48:30.185
You've earned
the right to be mad, okay?

48:33.355 --> 48:35.658
- Don't take it out on her.
- I didn't mean to.

48:35.692 --> 48:38.193
- I'm sorry, Jillian...
- Don't touch me.

48:41.698 --> 48:43.332
I wanna go home.

48:44.399 --> 48:46.201
Now.

48:46.235 --> 48:48.771
Jillian, you are right.

48:48.805 --> 48:51.708
I'm sorry I promised to love
and protect the both of you.

48:53.108 --> 48:54.276
I'm sorry.

48:57.145 --> 48:58.648
It's not your fault, Max.

49:01.684 --> 49:02.785
I'm not your kid.

49:05.688 --> 49:08.223
I'm hers.

49:08.257 --> 49:10.392
- Jillian, I didn't mean to.
- I'll be at the car.

49:10.425 --> 49:11.661
Jillian!

49:15.163 --> 49:16.766
- I didn't mean to.
- Excuse me.

49:18.367 --> 49:19.736
Max?

49:20.536 --> 49:21.804
Max.

49:26.174 --> 49:27.610
Work the program, T.

49:29.378 --> 49:30.813
You gotta work it for her.

49:34.116 --> 49:35.818
Let's go.

49:35.852 --> 49:37.152
- Bye.
- I didn't mean to.

49:40.823 --> 49:42.190
It was an accident.

49:58.808 --> 50:00.409
Okay.

50:01.611 --> 50:02.779
We are here,

50:03.445 --> 50:04.714
so let's talk.

50:04.747 --> 50:05.848
Now.

50:07.149 --> 50:08.450
I don't have anything to say.

50:08.483 --> 50:10.519
Yes, you do and so do you.

50:10.552 --> 50:12.321
So come on, let's get it
all out in the open.

50:12.354 --> 50:13.355
Go.

50:17.326 --> 50:18.527
You bailed on us.

50:18.560 --> 50:21.463
- You pushed me away.
- No, you bailed!

50:21.496 --> 50:24.132
When Deidre needed you,
when Tyra needed you.

50:24.166 --> 50:26.435
- Hell, when I needed you...
- All right, fine, I bailed!

50:27.269 --> 50:29.271
I bailed.

50:29.304 --> 50:31.506
And I used your attitude
as the excuse,

50:31.540 --> 50:33.308
but the truth is

50:33.342 --> 50:34.543
I was embarrassed.

50:36.311 --> 50:37.647
My life was shit.

50:39.214 --> 50:41.584
My life is shit.

50:43.720 --> 50:46.321
Everyone always thinks that
being married to an athlete

50:46.355 --> 50:47.924
is this glamorous thing,

50:47.957 --> 50:50.660
like it's... like it's private jets and...
and fast cars,

50:50.693 --> 50:52.795
but no one ever shows you
what it's like

50:52.829 --> 50:55.230
being cut from three teams.

50:55.263 --> 50:56.866
No one ever shows you
what it's like

50:56.899 --> 51:00.302
when your husband's career
ends at 32.

51:00.335 --> 51:03.271
No one ever shows you
what it's like

51:04.373 --> 51:06.341
paying off women

51:06.375 --> 51:09.177
and praying that the paternity
test comes back negative.

51:10.713 --> 51:12.347
No one ever shows you that.

51:15.785 --> 51:17.319
And I could not face that.

51:18.855 --> 51:20.455
I couldn't face you.

51:35.270 --> 51:36.371
Shit.

51:38.240 --> 51:40.777
We can really go fuck up Trevor
if you want to.

51:40.810 --> 51:42.879
God, you really need to
check your aggression levels.

51:47.684 --> 51:48.951
Look,

51:49.451 --> 51:50.953
it's not all on you.

51:53.022 --> 51:54.724
I could have reached out, too.

51:59.294 --> 52:01.496
And I could have reached out
when James left.

52:02.699 --> 52:04.199
At least, asked you why.

52:11.674 --> 52:13.643
So are we good?

52:15.611 --> 52:17.013
- We're good.
- We're good.

52:17.046 --> 52:19.247
Huh?

52:19.281 --> 52:20.315
Okay, good, hug.

52:30.860 --> 52:33.562
Yeah. Yeah.

52:33.596 --> 52:36.032
- Yes.
- I'm so hungry.

52:36.065 --> 52:37.667
Why is it you're always hungry?

52:37.700 --> 52:39.301
I am always hungry.

52:47.476 --> 52:48.611
Come on in.

53:08.731 --> 53:10.532
- Can I?
- Sure.

53:16.571 --> 53:18.373
- Beautiful children.
- Thank you.

53:19.574 --> 53:22.845
Lisa was, um,
ten in that picture and Eric was eight.

53:30.753 --> 53:32.521
- I can't do this.
- Do what?

53:32.554 --> 53:34.356
Any of it. I mean...

53:34.389 --> 53:36.592
I mean I've only answered
one question in the notebook.

53:41.831 --> 53:43.633
My baby came to visit me,

53:44.399 --> 53:45.635
and...

53:46.736 --> 53:48.303
I was so frustrated

53:49.437 --> 53:51.107
that she had to see me like this

53:51.140 --> 53:52.574
that I lashed out at her.

53:56.545 --> 53:59.816
She has more strength and smarts in
her 15-year-old body than I ever had.

54:02.585 --> 54:04.419
Where do you think
she gets it from?

54:06.421 --> 54:08.958
Certainly not me.

54:26.776 --> 54:27.910
Hm.

54:35.417 --> 54:38.054
Is that the woman that you
have come to know as Tyra?

54:45.595 --> 54:48.130
I didn't think so.

54:48.164 --> 54:50.766
And that's not the woman Jillian
has come to know as her mother.

54:55.570 --> 54:57.039
But before either of you

54:58.107 --> 55:00.009
can know
who that woman is again,

55:00.042 --> 55:01.978
you have to be able to look
in that mirror

55:03.779 --> 55:05.447
and answer "yes"
to that question.

55:07.515 --> 55:09.752
That means working
from the inside out.

55:11.687 --> 55:13.756
You have to do
more than show up, Tyra.

55:19.862 --> 55:21.797
I'm gonna
give you a minute, okay?

55:22.464 --> 55:23.599
Mm-hm.

55:24.100 --> 55:25.533
Okay.

56:09.078 --> 56:10.713
What the fuck!

56:12.114 --> 56:14.116
Oh, hell no. Shit.

56:14.817 --> 56:16.018
What the...

56:21.757 --> 56:25.560
You gotta be...
What's going on around here?

56:27.263 --> 56:28.898
Oh hell, no!

56:29.799 --> 56:32.467
This my shit! This my shit!

56:33.002 --> 56:35.738
Suzanne! Suzanne!

56:35.771 --> 56:37.472
Oh, fuck that shit.

56:39.208 --> 56:41.944
She got my shit out here
on the fuckin' couch!

56:56.892 --> 56:58.560
We brought you
some cider.

56:59.295 --> 57:01.097
And I have wine for us.

57:17.113 --> 57:18.848
Hey, babe, slow down.

57:20.182 --> 57:22.517
So what do you think about me
moving back in?

57:25.221 --> 57:27.089
- Babe?
- I heard you.

57:29.992 --> 57:31.894
Well, Jackson, you can't just,

57:31.927 --> 57:34.897
you know, throw our family
in a microwave

57:34.930 --> 57:37.299
and <i>voila,</i>
everything is magically done.

57:37.333 --> 57:39.101
But aren't you
enjoying this?

57:39.135 --> 57:40.936
- Us?
- Well, I am. I am.

57:42.271 --> 57:43.606
Six years.

57:46.675 --> 57:48.611
So you don't need me anymore?

57:48.644 --> 57:50.813
No, Jackson, it's... it's...
it's not about,

57:51.881 --> 57:53.649
you know, needing you or not.

57:55.851 --> 57:57.153
I... I found a routine.

57:59.789 --> 58:01.057
I... I...

58:02.391 --> 58:04.760
I don't know if I learned
to survive without you.

58:05.227 --> 58:06.762
No, you have.

58:06.796 --> 58:07.997
Look, you grew up.

58:08.030 --> 58:10.266
You're in school,
you're learning new things.

58:11.167 --> 58:12.567
That's surviving.

58:13.836 --> 58:15.004
But I mean why...

58:16.672 --> 58:19.608
why can't we survive
together again?

58:20.676 --> 58:21.877
As a family?

58:23.145 --> 58:24.613
Uh...

58:25.781 --> 58:27.783
Oh.

58:27.817 --> 58:32.721
The first week after you told me
you wanna divorce me, I was...

58:32.755 --> 58:34.256
wanting you to say
those exact words.

58:36.058 --> 58:37.960
No, no, no, let me finish.

58:39.762 --> 58:40.996
I was hurt.

58:42.431 --> 58:44.233
You know, it's like
in one fell swoop...

58:44.266 --> 58:46.936
Pfft, my whole family
was just gone.

58:46.969 --> 58:49.872
And I kept thinking,
"He's gonna come back.

58:49.905 --> 58:52.641
"He's going to realize
that he made a mistake."

58:54.076 --> 58:56.312
But you didn't.

58:56.345 --> 58:58.013
And I was left
to pick up the pieces.

59:06.288 --> 59:07.990
Johanna offered me a job.

59:10.726 --> 59:13.395
Yeah, she, uh,
needs a choreographer for her new tour.

59:14.697 --> 59:15.931
I took it.

59:17.833 --> 59:19.135
I need this.

59:21.237 --> 59:23.405
So, us?

59:25.274 --> 59:26.809
Jackson, I need this.

59:33.482 --> 59:35.751
Oh, okay. Okay.

59:38.754 --> 59:40.356
What... what do you
need me to do?

59:42.291 --> 59:44.994
- Um, you could be there for me this time.
- Okay.

59:45.027 --> 59:46.862
You know, look after J.J.

59:48.864 --> 59:52.401
I can. I can do that.
I... I can absolutely do that.

59:54.503 --> 59:55.971
Thanks.

59:58.207 --> 1:00:01.177
Ew, that's gross.

1:00:01.210 --> 1:00:03.245
Can we go to Fatburger?

1:00:03.279 --> 1:00:04.313
How do you know
about Fatburger?

1:00:04.346 --> 1:00:05.414
- Do you eat Fatburger?
- What?

1:00:05.447 --> 1:00:07.783
Um, Dad and I go all the time.

1:00:09.151 --> 1:00:11.086
Dad... You and Dad
go all the time?

1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:12.888
- Wait, is that a problem?
- Yeah, wait.

1:00:12.922 --> 1:00:15.357
- Jackson? You and Dad... You and Dad...
- What? I really felt...

1:00:15.391 --> 1:00:17.960
- Go all the time?
- Yeah, you know what?

1:00:17.993 --> 1:00:19.828
- Salads for you, man.
- No, no, no. Let's go to Fatburger.

1:00:19.862 --> 1:00:21.197
- I'm gonna see... we gonna get you a Fatburger.
- Daddy's gonna pay.

1:00:21.230 --> 1:00:22.031
- Daddy's gonna pay for Fatburger.
- You're gonna get a fat salad

1:00:22.064 --> 1:00:23.799
- is what you're gonna get.
- Come on.

1:00:23.832 --> 1:00:25.000
Come on. It's on Daddy.

1:00:25.034 --> 1:00:26.335
Let's go.

1:00:26.368 --> 1:00:27.836
- Come on.
- Really?

1:01:17.219 --> 1:01:18.320
<i>Hi, yeah.
Yeah, so we're looking for...</i>

1:02:25.655 --> 1:02:27.256
- Excuse me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:02:27.289 --> 1:02:28.424
Mm-hm.

1:02:29.525 --> 1:02:31.093
What are you doing?

1:02:31.126 --> 1:02:33.128
I am, uh, cooking you breakfast.

1:02:33.162 --> 1:02:34.296
Oh, I'll wash my hands.

1:02:34.330 --> 1:02:36.398
No, I said, "I'm cookin'."

1:02:41.170 --> 1:02:43.439
So what am I supposed to do
while you cook breakfast?

1:02:43.472 --> 1:02:46.609
Uh, chill. Relax a little.

1:02:46.643 --> 1:02:50.412
Okay, well,
can I at least make coffee?

1:02:50.446 --> 1:02:53.048
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1:02:55.652 --> 1:02:57.219
So what are you makin' me?

1:02:57.252 --> 1:02:59.555
I am makin'
my world-famous French toast,

1:02:59.589 --> 1:03:02.157
some hash browns,
and, uh, some sliced tomato.

1:03:04.126 --> 1:03:07.664
Okay, sounds good. And fattening.

1:03:07.697 --> 1:03:10.332
It's all right to have a little
every once in a while.

1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:13.535
You know,
I never really get to do this.

1:03:13.569 --> 1:03:17.439
You know, one day I wanna make this
like a... a family tradition, you know?

1:03:17.473 --> 1:03:20.409
Junior in the kitchen with me,
his little sister off with his mom,

1:03:20.442 --> 1:03:23.345
doin' whatever they choose.

1:03:23.379 --> 1:03:26.915
We'll call it "Men-folks
Saturday."

1:03:26.949 --> 1:03:28.283
Two kids?

1:03:28.317 --> 1:03:30.119
Yeah, yeah.

1:03:30.152 --> 1:03:32.421
Oh, and a dog named "Ralph".

1:03:34.523 --> 1:03:35.958
Ralph.

1:03:36.726 --> 1:03:38.293
The all-American tradition.

1:03:38.628 --> 1:03:40.028
For sure.

1:03:41.497 --> 1:03:43.600
I know you got some dreams
tucked away in there.

1:03:45.635 --> 1:03:47.169
Nope.

1:03:49.238 --> 1:03:51.473
All right, I'm gonna get them
out of you one day.

1:03:56.044 --> 1:03:57.413
Uh, hi.

1:03:59.148 --> 1:04:01.584
Bye. Sure thing, yeah,
let's see.

1:04:11.393 --> 1:04:13.730
- Uh, would you please sit down?
- Yes.

1:04:13.763 --> 1:04:15.063
we have kids to get stuff out
of the house for us.

1:04:15.097 --> 1:04:17.366
No, but they are having
so much fun.

1:04:17.399 --> 1:04:19.401
- So?
- Oh, yeah.

1:04:19.435 --> 1:04:20.502
Okay.

1:04:21.403 --> 1:04:23.238
So, um,

1:04:23.272 --> 1:04:25.140
how does it feel to live in this

1:04:25.174 --> 1:04:27.342
big-ass house
all by yourself now?

1:04:27.376 --> 1:04:29.712
Oh, it's different. I mean...

1:04:29.746 --> 1:04:31.146
I just...

1:04:33.783 --> 1:04:35.451
You know what? Never mind.

1:04:35.484 --> 1:04:36.753
This is supposed
to be a celebration,

1:04:36.786 --> 1:04:39.021
we are supposed
to be having fun, right?

1:04:39.054 --> 1:04:40.456
- Yes.
- We are celebrating you.

1:04:40.489 --> 1:04:43.525
Yes, yes, yes!
To Dee-Dee's dream job.

1:04:43.559 --> 1:04:46.094
- Well, you know, we're not sure...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:04:46.128 --> 1:04:48.197
He said that he has you
and he's gonna support you,

1:04:48.230 --> 1:04:50.265
so let's just trust that he
has turned over a new leaf.

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:52.434
Hm.

1:04:52.468 --> 1:04:55.037
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa.

1:04:55.070 --> 1:04:56.538
Did you just shrug?

1:04:56.572 --> 1:04:59.475
- Mm-hm, we saw that, yep.
- "Ms. Shrugging is not an answer" just shrugged.

1:04:59.508 --> 1:05:01.143
- Uh, you see everything.
- Yeah.

1:05:01.176 --> 1:05:02.645
- I knew.
- Yes, I...

1:05:02.679 --> 1:05:06.081
- I think she did. I think she did.
- Yeah, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:05:06.114 --> 1:05:08.083
- To my new job.
- Yes.

1:05:09.719 --> 1:05:12.354
Dad?

1:05:12.387 --> 1:05:14.791
Dad, can you come play
Marco Polo with us?

1:05:14.824 --> 1:05:16.358
You too, Mr. Walter.

1:05:16.391 --> 1:05:19.228
Yeah, come on, Mr. Walter,
don't be a punk.

1:05:20.162 --> 1:05:21.497
I mean, Mr. Walter, let's go.

1:05:21.530 --> 1:05:23.098
- Hey, that... that sounds like a challenge.
- Let's go!

1:05:23.131 --> 1:05:25.067
Marco!

1:05:28.738 --> 1:05:30.372
What you got? What you got?

1:05:30.405 --> 1:05:32.508
All right,
who's Marco?

1:05:32.541 --> 1:05:36.311
Probably me if Mr. Walter
would stop cheating.

1:05:36.345 --> 1:05:38.615
- I'm not cheating, man. Come on.
- Yes, you are!

1:05:38.648 --> 1:05:40.449
Oh!

1:05:40.482 --> 1:05:43.252
- I hit the fireball!
- Let's get it.

1:05:43.285 --> 1:05:46.823
- Oh, see, oh, look. Here we go.
- Oh, oh.

1:05:46.856 --> 1:05:48.257
So Patty, later on tonight,

1:05:48.290 --> 1:05:51.828
you and Walter can sleep in the guestroom
on the right side of the stairs,

1:05:51.861 --> 1:05:53.730
and then you and Jackson
can be on the left,

1:05:53.763 --> 1:05:55.397
and then the kids
can stay down here.

1:05:56.766 --> 1:06:00.102
- Did you just...
- What?

1:06:00.135 --> 1:06:02.304
Did you just list

1:06:02.337 --> 1:06:04.807
all four other rooms
like it's no big deal?

1:06:04.841 --> 1:06:07.644
Oh, no, no, no, they are just things.
Believe me, they do not make a home.

1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:13.716
Guys... There's...

1:06:14.651 --> 1:06:16.552
- We're here...
- Oh my God.

1:06:16.586 --> 1:06:18.453
Together.

1:06:18.487 --> 1:06:20.657
You know,
let's bask in this.

1:06:20.690 --> 1:06:23.125
Oh, like, that peace pipe
you smoke

1:06:23.158 --> 1:06:25.193
must be some, like,
next level shit.

1:06:26.495 --> 1:06:29.164
Shut up. You ruined my moment.

1:06:29.197 --> 1:06:31.734
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

1:07:08.805 --> 1:07:12.507
I was a beacon of hope
in my family's eyes.

1:07:12.541 --> 1:07:14.509
The first one
that was gonna go to college.

1:07:15.845 --> 1:07:19.281
So when they got that call
that I had given birth...

1:07:20.617 --> 1:07:22.685
my mom refused to come
to the hospital.

1:07:23.953 --> 1:07:25.487
She turned her back on me.

1:07:26.856 --> 1:07:29.726
I spent two months in a home

1:07:29.759 --> 1:07:34.697
until I graduated
and continued to make a plan

1:07:34.731 --> 1:07:36.633
for a life for me
and my daughter.

1:07:38.567 --> 1:07:41.269
I haven't spoken
to my parents in 15 years.

1:07:41.303 --> 1:07:45.374
It was all a struggle, college
and graduate school,

1:07:45.407 --> 1:07:47.376
but I was doing it.

1:07:47.409 --> 1:07:49.511
And uh, my friends pitched in.

1:07:49.544 --> 1:07:51.748
Patrice is pretty much
like her other mother.

1:07:52.682 --> 1:07:56.719
And with their help,
I graduated on time

1:07:56.753 --> 1:07:59.421
and got a scholarship
to graduate school.

1:08:02.825 --> 1:08:04.259
I was sailing,

1:08:07.529 --> 1:08:08.798
but inside...

1:08:10.499 --> 1:08:11.801
I was dying.

1:08:16.571 --> 1:08:18.340
It was just so much pressure.

1:08:21.978 --> 1:08:24.614
So much I felt like owed my kid,

1:08:24.647 --> 1:08:26.548
<i>but when I met Max,</i>

1:08:26.582 --> 1:08:29.317
I felt like everything
was coming together.

1:08:29.351 --> 1:08:32.287
You know, he...
he loved Jillian.

1:08:33.488 --> 1:08:35.257
And...

1:08:35.290 --> 1:08:38.293
we became a family.
I had a family.

1:08:45.267 --> 1:08:47.469
But there was still
that pressure.

1:08:51.874 --> 1:08:54.342
One day, I was in a rush.

1:08:54.376 --> 1:08:57.680
I was, um, picking up Jillian
from a friend's house

1:08:57.714 --> 1:08:59.548
and I got into a car accident.

1:09:00.917 --> 1:09:02.585
They prescribed me Oxy...

1:09:03.786 --> 1:09:04.987
and...

1:09:07.757 --> 1:09:09.959
that first pill...

1:09:10.827 --> 1:09:13.596
Wow, yeah.

1:09:16.032 --> 1:09:19.936
It was like, all the pressure
was gone.

1:09:24.807 --> 1:09:27.910
Yeah, and um,

1:09:27.944 --> 1:09:31.446
I hadn't known what
that felt like in 15 years.

1:09:33.015 --> 1:09:34.584
To have no pressure.

1:09:38.688 --> 1:09:40.857
And so I took another one,

1:09:42.058 --> 1:09:44.326
and another one...

1:09:45.962 --> 1:09:47.597
and here I am.

1:09:57.840 --> 1:09:59.474
I'm an addict.

1:10:03.646 --> 1:10:05.047
And I don't wanna be one.

1:10:10.552 --> 1:10:12.989
Thank you.

1:10:17.827 --> 1:10:20.295
Come, come.

1:10:22.397 --> 1:10:24.066
Good girl.

1:10:24.100 --> 1:10:25.467
Good girl.

1:10:27.837 --> 1:10:29.571
That was really nice.

1:10:29.605 --> 1:10:32.041
I understand why Jillian
wanted to stay.

1:10:32.074 --> 1:10:33.743
And those kids.

1:10:38.681 --> 1:10:41.550
I didn't realize how much
I missed my nieces and nephews.

1:10:44.086 --> 1:10:45.955
Everything okay?

1:10:47.123 --> 1:10:49.424
Yeah, of course.

1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:52.862
Uh...

1:10:52.895 --> 1:10:55.965
you're sure? I mean,
you've been real quiet.

1:10:58.400 --> 1:10:59.602
I'm sure.

1:11:16.953 --> 1:11:18.588
You have a five-year plan.

1:11:20.422 --> 1:11:22.892
Hell, it might even be three?

1:11:22.925 --> 1:11:24.727
Yeah, I, I guess so.

1:11:25.728 --> 1:11:27.763
And that plan includes a house

1:11:27.797 --> 1:11:28.998
with kids that look like you

1:11:29.031 --> 1:11:32.400
and more nieces and nephews
to add to the Jordans' tribe.

1:11:32.434 --> 1:11:34.036
Uh, wait, where you going
with this?

1:11:35.503 --> 1:11:37.673
Are you... are you pregnant?

1:11:38.140 --> 1:11:39.876
Uh, are you?

1:11:40.776 --> 1:11:43.378
No, I'm not and...

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:46.115
I never will be.

1:11:57.492 --> 1:11:59.061
Wow, uh...

1:12:00.562 --> 1:12:02.865
- I...
- Look, you want 46 years

1:12:02.899 --> 1:12:05.868
and date nights and Junior
helping you in the kitchen

1:12:05.902 --> 1:12:08.436
while his sister hangs out
with mom, and...

1:12:08.470 --> 1:12:11.741
Marco Polo, and video games,
and I can't give you any of that.

1:12:11.774 --> 1:12:12.975
Okay, okay, look, I don't...

1:12:13.009 --> 1:12:14.844
I don't know what you
want me to say here.

1:12:14.877 --> 1:12:18.080
All right? I just...

1:12:19.514 --> 1:12:20.650
Look...

1:12:21.684 --> 1:12:23.485
you don't have to say anything.

1:12:25.121 --> 1:12:26.488
I like you.

1:12:27.690 --> 1:12:30.026
I really, really like you.

1:12:33.029 --> 1:12:36.165
But... I know what comes next.

1:12:38.834 --> 1:12:41.103
So I am gonna save us both
some trouble and allow you

1:12:41.137 --> 1:12:42.672
to bow out now.

1:12:46.042 --> 1:12:47.643
Good bye, Walter.

1:13:19.942 --> 1:13:21.043
Patrice!

1:13:25.681 --> 1:13:27.515
Look, let me in,
all right, please.

1:13:29.652 --> 1:13:33.055
Look, we can talk about this, all right?
I'll make this right.

1:14:38.054 --> 1:14:40.356
Oh, thank you.

1:14:40.389 --> 1:14:42.124
Thank you again,
though, for coming.

1:14:42.158 --> 1:14:44.360
I think you'll enjoy
the article.

1:14:44.393 --> 1:14:46.062
Uh, honestly, thank you
for having me.

1:14:46.095 --> 1:14:48.297
I'm really lookin' forward
to seeing how it turns out.

1:14:48.330 --> 1:14:49.665
- Of course.
- It's nice meeting you.

1:14:49.698 --> 1:14:50.933
Nice meeting you.

1:14:59.708 --> 1:15:01.677
Hi.

1:15:01.710 --> 1:15:03.913
- Hey.
- How have you been?

1:15:03.946 --> 1:15:06.615
Uh, good. Good, no complaints.

1:15:06.649 --> 1:15:09.752
Good. Good, that's really good.

1:15:10.719 --> 1:15:12.688
And you? The baby?

1:15:12.721 --> 1:15:16.125
Same.
Same, no complaints.

1:15:16.158 --> 1:15:18.861
We had an appointment
earlier on today and...

1:15:18.894 --> 1:15:20.629
everything's good, so...

1:15:24.700 --> 1:15:29.105
You know, I was,
I was um, thinking that

1:15:29.138 --> 1:15:32.842
maybe we could grab dinner
or something?

1:15:34.944 --> 1:15:39.782
I miss you and I think
we need to talk.

1:15:42.685 --> 1:15:44.353
I miss you, too, Suzanne.

1:15:44.386 --> 1:15:48.357
We could go to that
Italian restaurant that you like

1:15:48.390 --> 1:15:50.426
or I could...
I could cook.

1:15:50.459 --> 1:15:52.962
Yeah, but I... I won't
have dinner with you.

1:15:55.931 --> 1:15:58.901
I told you I'm out
and I meant it.

1:16:00.703 --> 1:16:02.705
- But I... I've...
- Good luck with everything.

1:16:31.967 --> 1:16:34.303
Guess it's just us.

1:16:34.336 --> 1:16:36.071
- Cool.
- Cool.

1:17:30.926 --> 1:17:31.927
Hey.

1:17:35.831 --> 1:17:38.033
You actually brought it?

1:17:38.067 --> 1:17:40.002
You know, you could have
just mailed it.

1:17:40.035 --> 1:17:41.136
I wanted to see you.

1:17:43.072 --> 1:17:44.940
Hey, I can't stay.

1:17:47.009 --> 1:17:49.945
But I should have told you this
a while ago, you are wrong.

1:17:50.813 --> 1:17:51.981
About?

1:17:53.082 --> 1:17:54.316
You are my kid.

1:17:55.184 --> 1:17:56.285
Maybe not by blood,

1:17:56.318 --> 1:17:59.221
but you are just as much
my daughter as you are Tyra's.

1:18:00.356 --> 1:18:02.491
And hey, I get it.

1:18:02.524 --> 1:18:05.894
You got a lot of feelings you're
tryin' to figure out, but I need you...

1:18:06.596 --> 1:18:08.364
to know this, okay?

1:18:09.898 --> 1:18:11.100
I love you.

1:18:12.067 --> 1:18:14.136
I love you.

1:18:14.169 --> 1:18:16.138
When you're ready to come home,
you come home.

1:18:17.339 --> 1:18:18.941
I'm not goin' anywhere.

1:18:21.310 --> 1:18:22.378
Okay?

1:18:23.345 --> 1:18:24.847
Okay.

1:18:31.453 --> 1:18:34.857
- Hey, let's show this off.
- Yeah.

1:18:34.890 --> 1:18:37.126
Well, it's really dope.
Thank you.

1:18:37.159 --> 1:18:38.794
- See you later.
- Okay.

1:18:40.529 --> 1:18:41.930
Bye.

1:18:53.909 --> 1:18:56.445
I don't know how
she's so healthy.

1:18:56.478 --> 1:18:58.447
I mean no prenatal
care whatsoever.

1:18:59.348 --> 1:19:00.949
Yeah, but um,

1:19:00.983 --> 1:19:05.254
other than the chicken pox, like nothing
so... Oh God, and that was a nightmare.

1:19:05.287 --> 1:19:07.590
But other than that
nothing serious.

1:19:07.624 --> 1:19:09.325
Oh, except for potty training.

1:19:09.759 --> 1:19:12.027
Potty training.

1:19:12.061 --> 1:19:13.529
She would not get on the toilet

1:19:13.562 --> 1:19:15.898
unless Patrice and I sang
this one song.

1:19:16.666 --> 1:19:18.067
Yeah...

1:19:18.967 --> 1:19:20.336
I guess I did manage.

1:19:25.007 --> 1:19:28.510
Um, I think you're ready
for another notebook.

1:19:32.649 --> 1:19:34.283
Yeah, I think I am.

1:19:34.316 --> 1:19:37.186
Yeah, I think so, too, my dear.

1:19:39.188 --> 1:19:40.590
For you.

1:19:46.261 --> 1:19:47.396
I will see you in group.

1:19:48.230 --> 1:19:49.398
I will see you in group.

1:19:51.066 --> 1:19:52.401
Thank you.

1:19:52.434 --> 1:19:55.003
No, honey, thank you.

1:20:01.477 --> 1:20:03.312
I'm so sorry.

1:20:13.389 --> 1:20:17.493
It'll be okay and our
little girl will be okay, too.

1:20:30.539 --> 1:20:32.007
So you guys ready
to order some food?

1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:35.577
Your aunties will be here any minute,
but we can go ahead and get started.

1:20:35.612 --> 1:20:37.714
- Michael, your grandmother knows where you are?
- Yeah.

1:20:37.747 --> 1:20:39.716
- Yeah?
- Uh...

1:20:39.749 --> 1:20:43.118
Yes, Ms. Patrice.
She... she knows.

1:20:43.152 --> 1:20:45.722
Uh, yeah, I guess we can order.
I'll come get the menus.

1:20:45.755 --> 1:20:48.090
- Okay.
- We'll be right back.

1:20:53.295 --> 1:20:55.097
I got this
in the mail yesterday.

1:21:09.111 --> 1:21:10.379
Did you write her back?

1:21:13.215 --> 1:21:14.751
Choice is yours.

1:21:14.784 --> 1:21:18.520
Max says there is like this family day
and that he'll take me if I wanna go.

1:21:19.656 --> 1:21:21.023
Do you?

1:21:21.624 --> 1:21:23.225
Maybe.

1:21:25.227 --> 1:21:26.596
It's up to you.

1:21:27.664 --> 1:21:29.732
But know no matter what...

1:21:29.766 --> 1:21:31.533
I always got you.

1:21:31.567 --> 1:21:33.235
Because you love me
more than anything?

1:21:33.268 --> 1:21:35.337
Mm-hm. And don't you ever forget it.

1:21:36.305 --> 1:21:38.240
Here, take these to Michael.

1:21:38.273 --> 1:21:39.709
Okay, we won't be
in you guy's way.

1:21:39.742 --> 1:21:41.243
You're never in the way.

1:21:45.314 --> 1:21:47.382
We're here!
Just gonna take my shoes off.

1:21:47.416 --> 1:21:50.152
Of course, you are.
In the kitchen.

1:21:52.789 --> 1:21:54.591
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:21:54.624 --> 1:21:57.059
- Hi, Aunt Patty. Bye, Aunt Patty.
- Oh.

1:21:57.092 --> 1:21:59.161
- Uh.
- There you go.

1:21:59.194 --> 1:22:01.196
Hi.

1:22:01.230 --> 1:22:04.333
So, this is actually
a mini-ambush.

1:22:06.101 --> 1:22:07.536
What do you mean?

1:22:07.569 --> 1:22:09.271
You'll see. Follow me.

1:22:13.342 --> 1:22:14.711
Uh-huh!

1:22:15.310 --> 1:22:17.212
Wha... What...

1:22:17.814 --> 1:22:19.515
What is this?

1:22:19.548 --> 1:22:22.284
- All, Patty.
- No, stop it, you helped.

1:22:22.317 --> 1:22:25.053
That nursery still was empty
and we have a new niece coming.

1:22:25.087 --> 1:22:29.358
- And before you say anything, we have a crib and bassinet...
- Yeah.

1:22:29.391 --> 1:22:31.026
...being delivered next week.

1:22:35.130 --> 1:22:36.666
How...

1:22:37.634 --> 1:22:39.468
When did you do...

1:22:40.502 --> 1:22:42.639
I love babies.

1:22:42.672 --> 1:22:44.674
And buying stuff.
She likes buying stuff.

1:22:44.707 --> 1:22:46.308
Oh, yeah, sure.

1:22:46.876 --> 1:22:48.544
I mean I was gonna...

1:22:49.812 --> 1:22:52.247
I was gonna do
all this myself, but...

1:22:52.281 --> 1:22:53.750
Now, you don't have to.

1:22:59.321 --> 1:23:02.692
Is it wrong that I haven't fully
accepted that I am gonna be...

1:23:03.893 --> 1:23:06.395
a mom?

1:23:06.428 --> 1:23:08.865
I always thought that when
I become a parent,

1:23:08.898 --> 1:23:11.868
I would have a husband
to go along with it.

1:23:11.901 --> 1:23:13.770
And I always thought that
if I was gonna be a parent,

1:23:13.803 --> 1:23:16.538
I would be pushing it out
of my own body.

1:23:16.572 --> 1:23:21.176
But... things don't always go the
way we want or the way we thought.

1:23:22.612 --> 1:23:25.682
Oh, Patty, I'm...

1:23:25.715 --> 1:23:29.384
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay, I promise.

1:23:29.418 --> 1:23:31.253
It's okay, it's fine.

1:23:31.286 --> 1:23:32.589
- Want some wine. You got wine?
- Yeah.

1:23:32.622 --> 1:23:34.389
- Let's have wine.
- Let's have wine.

1:23:34.423 --> 1:23:35.959
Cider for you, missy.

1:23:35.992 --> 1:23:38.293
Cider for you, missy. Come on, let's
kick those kids out of that living room.

1:23:39.194 --> 1:23:42.164
Wait, you didn't run
to the elevator

1:23:42.197 --> 1:23:44.734
and tell him about Trevor,
you just let him walk away?

1:23:44.767 --> 1:23:47.369
Oh God, you messed up now.
The shrugging.

1:23:47.402 --> 1:23:50.807
What? Yes, no, I just left it
at that, Deidre.

1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:52.842
I mean what
was I supposed to do?

1:23:52.875 --> 1:23:56.178
Run down the stairs
in my condition and just...

1:23:56.211 --> 1:23:58.313
pull a <i>Say Anything...</i> moment?

1:23:58.347 --> 1:24:00.917
Maybe. I just don't want
you to give up.

1:24:00.950 --> 1:24:03.318
Oh, wait, wait,

1:24:03.352 --> 1:24:06.789
she wants you to do like she did when
she caught herself in love with...

1:24:06.823 --> 1:24:08.758
- What was his name?
- Henry.

1:24:08.791 --> 1:24:11.159
Henry James.

1:24:11.193 --> 1:24:13.161
You know what? You know what?

1:24:13.195 --> 1:24:17.299
Shut it, okay?
I put myself out there.

1:24:17.332 --> 1:24:20.569
I tried, and I put myself
out there, I was open to love.

1:24:20.603 --> 1:24:23.505
No, you put out before prom
and got played.

1:24:23.538 --> 1:24:26.441
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

1:24:26.475 --> 1:24:28.377
She's kinda right, you were
kind of a fast ass.

1:24:28.410 --> 1:24:30.847
- Yes.
- Screw you both.

1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:33.850
Screw you both. I liked sex.

1:24:33.883 --> 1:24:36.619
And I still like sex.

1:24:36.653 --> 1:24:39.521
But the point is, I tried.

1:24:39.554 --> 1:24:42.625
And you should try, too.

1:24:42.659 --> 1:24:45.728
Okay, so what...
what was I supposed to do, Deidre?

1:24:45.762 --> 1:24:48.196
Should have I said, um...

1:24:48.230 --> 1:24:53.468
<i>♪ Oh no, I can't let you
Get the best of me</i>

1:24:53.502 --> 1:24:55.972
<i>♪ Even though deep inside</i>

1:24:56.005 --> 1:24:58.875
<i>♪ Something's dyin' to see</i>

1:24:58.908 --> 1:25:00.342
<i>♪ How you put... ♪</i>

1:25:00.375 --> 1:25:02.845
Okay, okay, okay!

1:25:02.879 --> 1:25:05.715
God, you two are assholes.
Give me some more wine.

1:25:06.749 --> 1:25:09.752
Give me. Thank you.

1:25:09.786 --> 1:25:14.456
And you, you...
you know, you messed up.

1:25:14.489 --> 1:25:16.826
What? I told him,
he was silent,

1:25:16.859 --> 1:25:19.461
so I just did
what was inevitable.

1:25:19.494 --> 1:25:21.229
You know, you always
do that, right?

1:25:22.264 --> 1:25:24.533
- What?
- Decided the way something was gonna be

1:25:24.566 --> 1:25:26.636
acted before
it actually happened.

1:25:26.669 --> 1:25:27.970
No.

1:25:28.771 --> 1:25:30.006
Uh-huh.
- No.

1:25:30.039 --> 1:25:32.307
She's right, she's right.
You are right.

1:25:33.308 --> 1:25:35.878
You need to allow yourself

1:25:35.912 --> 1:25:39.247
to open up to the idea of,
of something good happening.

1:25:39.281 --> 1:25:41.918
Oh. Thank you, Iyanla.

1:25:44.020 --> 1:25:46.589
I hate you both. I really do.

1:25:46.622 --> 1:25:48.691
And you're welcome.

1:25:50.392 --> 1:25:53.328
Oh, thank you, guys, for this.

1:25:53.963 --> 1:25:55.464
Seriously, I needed it.

1:25:57.466 --> 1:26:01.536
You guys... when Tyra comes home,
this will be our new normal.

1:26:03.039 --> 1:26:04.573
- Cheers.
- Yay!

1:26:04.607 --> 1:26:06.341
- To us. Back together.
- Yep.

1:26:06.374 --> 1:26:08.044
- Mm-hm. Yep.
- Again.

1:26:08.077 --> 1:26:10.445
- Again.
- Okay, I got it, I got it.

1:26:14.349 --> 1:26:15.818
Got that checked for you.

1:26:32.101 --> 1:26:33.636
Where you goin'?

1:26:33.669 --> 1:26:36.505
I'm tired. I gotta to go.

1:26:36.538 --> 1:26:38.941
- We...
- Tell J.J. I'll pick him up tomorrow.

1:26:38.975 --> 1:26:40.676
Okay, but you don't
have to leave.

1:26:40.710 --> 1:26:43.378
But is this how it's gonna be
from now on?

1:26:43.846 --> 1:26:45.514
For now.

1:26:45.547 --> 1:26:48.618
Look, I don't know, Dee.
I'll call you tomorrow.

1:27:07.369 --> 1:27:08.671
Ms. Dee, Ms. Erica...
Come quick. They're fighting.

1:27:08.704 --> 1:27:10.072
- Who? What?
- Jillian and Cecelia, they're fighting.

1:27:10.106 --> 1:27:12.041
Are you kidding me? Go, go, go!

1:27:17.747 --> 1:27:19.782
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get off her!

1:27:19.816 --> 1:27:21.550
What the hell is going on?
Jillian!

1:27:22.018 --> 1:27:23.886
Cecelia!

1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:26.923
Oh, so no one's gonna talk?
Okay, Erica's gonna deal with you all.

1:27:26.956 --> 1:27:28.791
We're goin' to a hospital and get
this looked at. Call their parents

1:27:28.825 --> 1:27:30.993
Get in here, now!
What are you thinkin'?

1:27:40.937 --> 1:27:42.872
You know where I am
if you need me.

1:28:01.123 --> 1:28:04.093
Hi, may I speak
to Tyra Harving?

1:28:06.128 --> 1:28:07.597
It's a family emergency.

1:28:25.248 --> 1:28:26.749
Who is it?

1:28:26.782 --> 1:28:27.783
Lorna.

1:28:42.698 --> 1:28:43.733
Yes?

1:28:43.766 --> 1:28:44.800
You okay?

1:28:44.834 --> 1:28:45.868
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:28:46.702 --> 1:28:47.703
You don't look fine.

1:28:48.905 --> 1:28:50.740
Well, I said that
I'm fine, so...

1:28:52.074 --> 1:28:53.109
Come on, man, back off.

1:28:53.142 --> 1:28:54.710
Okay, I'll back off,
I back off.

1:28:54.744 --> 1:28:55.945
I just heard
you were upset,

1:28:55.978 --> 1:28:57.880
so I thought
you might wanna talk.

1:28:57.914 --> 1:28:59.949
Well, there's nothing to talk
about, because I said that I'm fine.

1:28:59.982 --> 1:29:01.516
So I just... I wanna...
I'm gonna...

1:29:01.549 --> 1:29:02.652
- Okay.
- Lay down a little bit longer.

1:29:02.685 --> 1:29:03.686
Okay, all right.

1:29:03.719 --> 1:29:05.655
- My door's always open, okay?
- Okay, thank you.

1:29:07.522 --> 1:29:09.191
All right.

1:29:25.174 --> 1:29:27.209
Me! And he...
and he served me.

1:29:27.243 --> 1:29:28.476
At work?

1:29:28.510 --> 1:29:30.079
He served me!

1:29:31.948 --> 1:29:35.685
Oh. This idiot
served me at work.

1:29:37.987 --> 1:29:41.023
I'm about to be
a divorced single mother

1:29:41.057 --> 1:29:44.492
with an infant,
no husband,

1:29:44.526 --> 1:29:47.562
and he served me
at work!

1:29:47.596 --> 1:29:49.865
Okay, whoa, whoa!

1:29:50.900 --> 1:29:53.602
Wow! Stop it.

1:29:54.971 --> 1:29:56.906
Come over here,
come over here.

1:29:56.939 --> 1:29:58.708
Be careful. Whoa.

1:30:01.944 --> 1:30:02.945
Sit.

1:30:03.779 --> 1:30:04.814
Okay.

1:30:05.314 --> 1:30:06.816
Calm down.

1:30:07.917 --> 1:30:09.919
I just...
Just for me...

1:30:09.952 --> 1:30:12.621
I just wanna... You knew
that the divorce was coming,

1:30:12.655 --> 1:30:17.727
so are you more angry that
he served you first or at work?

1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:18.861
What?

1:30:18.894 --> 1:30:20.896
You've been ranting
for 13 minutes straight

1:30:20.930 --> 1:30:22.064
and she can't figure out
if you are more upset

1:30:22.098 --> 1:30:24.700
that he served you at work
or that he served you first.

1:30:24.734 --> 1:30:26.035
I personally think

1:30:26.068 --> 1:30:28.704
we should just keep destroying'
Trevor's shit or whoop his ass.

1:30:28.738 --> 1:30:30.306
Of course, you do, Patty.

1:30:30.339 --> 1:30:33.943
Look, you kicked him out,
you changed the locks,

1:30:33.976 --> 1:30:35.811
you won't answer
his calls.

1:30:35.845 --> 1:30:37.146
It's like,
what do you expect?

1:30:37.179 --> 1:30:40.950
I wanted to serve him,
when I was ready!

1:30:42.184 --> 1:30:43.953
I wanted to choose.

1:30:43.986 --> 1:30:45.955
I wanted to be
the one to decide.

1:30:45.988 --> 1:30:49.258
Okay. But you did choose.

1:30:49.291 --> 1:30:51.293
You chose when you kicked him
out of the house

1:30:51.327 --> 1:30:52.962
and you've been choosing
ever since.

1:30:53.796 --> 1:30:54.930
You made the choice.

1:30:59.635 --> 1:31:00.636
Mm-hm.

1:31:04.006 --> 1:31:05.107
I really got
my life back?

1:31:05.141 --> 1:31:08.177
- You sure did.
- Yep.

1:31:08.210 --> 1:31:10.646
And <i>adios</i> motherfucker
to Trevor.

1:31:10.679 --> 1:31:13.649
And now,
you focus on Carl.

1:31:13.682 --> 1:31:14.850
Duh.

1:31:17.053 --> 1:31:18.087
But you know what?

1:31:19.121 --> 1:31:23.959
I think it's time
that I focus on me.

1:31:26.896 --> 1:31:27.897
Feel better?

1:31:29.765 --> 1:31:31.167
Surprisingly, yes.

1:31:32.735 --> 1:31:33.736
Good.

1:31:35.004 --> 1:31:37.239
Yeah, I'm not gonna be the
only one cleaning up this mess.

1:31:40.843 --> 1:31:43.746
I took the other two last night,
that's the last one.

1:31:43.779 --> 1:31:44.814
You wanna
talk about it?

1:31:54.290 --> 1:31:55.324
Have a seat.

1:32:03.399 --> 1:32:05.367
My baby got beat up.

1:32:07.303 --> 1:32:11.340
She got beat up really bad
and I just kept thinking

1:32:11.373 --> 1:32:13.609
if I had been out there that
would have never happened.

1:32:16.879 --> 1:32:18.047
She's not a fighter.

1:32:19.315 --> 1:32:21.150
Somebody had to have
provoked her.

1:32:27.723 --> 1:32:28.958
Did you know
I was an addict?

1:32:31.026 --> 1:32:32.194
18 years sober.

1:32:34.096 --> 1:32:38.400
Every day is a test.

1:32:38.434 --> 1:32:43.305
You see, I still remember um,
when they took my kids away

1:32:43.339 --> 1:32:45.307
and put 'em
in a foster home.

1:32:45.341 --> 1:32:48.344
And you see, I also remember
when I got that call...

1:32:51.147 --> 1:32:52.648
Someone abused my baby.

1:32:54.483 --> 1:32:55.684
Mm.

1:32:58.921 --> 1:33:02.758
Oh. How did you resist?

1:33:02.791 --> 1:33:03.826
I didn't.

1:33:05.794 --> 1:33:07.129
Oh, and I got plastered.

1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:13.235
You see,
I don't remember um,

1:33:14.937 --> 1:33:16.872
falling through
a glass window at a diner.

1:33:19.341 --> 1:33:21.277
I was pretty cut up.

1:33:21.310 --> 1:33:24.180
Really bad and they didn't even
think if I was gonna make it.

1:33:27.283 --> 1:33:29.051
But after I got out
of the hospital,

1:33:31.253 --> 1:33:35.891
I realized the only way I was
gonna protect Lisa and Eric

1:33:36.892 --> 1:33:37.960
was to get better.

1:33:40.829 --> 1:33:43.265
And it's been an uphill battle
ever since.

1:33:45.834 --> 1:33:48.204
It's a continual fight.

1:33:51.307 --> 1:33:53.809
It is one that you
have to wanna win.

1:33:56.946 --> 1:33:58.847
I just don't wanna keep
letting her down.

1:33:58.881 --> 1:34:02.184
How about you stop
letting yourself down first?

1:34:11.961 --> 1:34:13.128
I think I need to stay.

1:34:16.232 --> 1:34:17.266
Then stay.

1:34:19.868 --> 1:34:20.869
Stay.

1:34:23.539 --> 1:34:24.740
Yeah.

1:34:31.013 --> 1:34:32.248
Patrice, wait.

1:34:36.352 --> 1:34:37.353
How you doing'?

1:34:38.487 --> 1:34:40.923
I'm good, Walter. You?

1:34:41.490 --> 1:34:42.491
I'm good.

1:34:46.061 --> 1:34:47.129
I'm gonna just
say this.

1:34:49.198 --> 1:34:51.267
I know you had some
hard knocks in your life,

1:34:52.434 --> 1:34:55.070
I... I don't think that should
keep you from dreaming'

1:34:56.338 --> 1:34:57.806
and believing
in other people.

1:35:00.242 --> 1:35:02.411
You gotta tear that brick wall
l down a little bit.

1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:06.849
Not everybody is gonna be
strong enough to jump over it.

1:35:08.017 --> 1:35:09.018
Don't go.

1:35:24.033 --> 1:35:27.136
You started to share all
of these things that you wanted.

1:35:27.169 --> 1:35:29.872
You saw your life
so clear.

1:35:34.076 --> 1:35:37.980
When we found out
that I couldn't have kids,

1:35:39.315 --> 1:35:40.849
James played it so cool.

1:35:42.084 --> 1:35:46.455
He said it was no big deal
until it was.

1:35:46.488 --> 1:35:49.325
And eventually,
he just resented me until he killed us...

1:35:49.358 --> 1:35:51.093
I'm not him, Patrice.

1:35:51.994 --> 1:35:52.995
I know.

1:35:57.667 --> 1:36:01.270
Just... I got so
scared with you.

1:36:04.473 --> 1:36:07.509
What if I can't complete this
ideal that you have in your head?

1:36:07.543 --> 1:36:09.044
All of that can change.

1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:13.982
One day, you are gonna
have to take a leap

1:36:14.016 --> 1:36:16.852
and trust that somebody
is willing' to catch you.

1:36:18.954 --> 1:36:20.122
Now, I really like you

1:36:22.257 --> 1:36:25.361
and if at some point
further down the line...

1:36:26.462 --> 1:36:27.529
We can make this work.

1:36:29.465 --> 1:36:31.634
There are so many ways
that we can make a family.

1:36:33.302 --> 1:36:35.037
I'm not just locked
into one.

1:36:37.239 --> 1:36:39.575
And look at you
and Jillian.

1:36:39.609 --> 1:36:42.344
Do you love her any less 'cause
she's not your... your kid?

1:36:42.378 --> 1:36:46.515
No. I... I even looked
into adoption, but...

1:36:49.385 --> 1:36:51.387
You say this now, okay?

1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:52.756
But what if you change
your mind?

1:36:52.789 --> 1:36:55.658
What if my cracked up uterus gets
in the way of your life plan?

1:36:55.692 --> 1:36:57.326
My life...
my life plan?

1:36:58.862 --> 1:37:04.066
Patrice, we have no idea what's going'
to happen in the future, all right?

1:37:04.099 --> 1:37:05.567
All we can do is control
is right now.

1:37:07.136 --> 1:37:11.940
We live for now and we continue
to live for now.

1:37:16.078 --> 1:37:17.146
Okay.

1:37:21.751 --> 1:37:22.951
Okay.

1:37:34.062 --> 1:37:35.130
I wanna leap.

1:37:41.336 --> 1:37:42.705
And I want you
to catch me.

1:37:54.584 --> 1:37:57.352
I'm gonna catch you and your
cracked up uterus.

1:38:10.399 --> 1:38:12.568
So you never
coming back to class?

1:38:15.404 --> 1:38:18.574
You came all the way over here just
to ask if I was coming to dance?

1:38:18.608 --> 1:38:20.509
I mean,
who else I'm talk to?

1:38:24.179 --> 1:38:28.217
Those things that they said
about me and my mom...

1:38:28.250 --> 1:38:31.654
My dad, you know, split
and my mom got locked up,

1:38:31.688 --> 1:38:35.190
people made mad jokes
and I fought.

1:38:37.794 --> 1:38:40.730
But Ms. Dee said I ain't my circumstances
and neither are you, Jillian.

1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:45.067
You know,
my mom is...

1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:46.101
Getting' help.

1:38:46.669 --> 1:38:47.704
That's good for her.

1:38:47.737 --> 1:38:49.271
Shit, it's more than
some peeps.

1:38:52.207 --> 1:38:55.077
You're not like the boys
I go to school with.

1:38:55.110 --> 1:38:57.814
And you're not like the girls
I go to school with.

1:38:57.847 --> 1:39:00.082
Like Cecelia.

1:39:00.115 --> 1:39:02.317
Uh, you're dope
and don't even know it,

1:39:02.351 --> 1:39:03.786
which makes you
a lot doper.

1:39:04.721 --> 1:39:06.388
Okay, now you're just
pushing it.

1:39:06.421 --> 1:39:07.422
I'm serious.

1:39:12.528 --> 1:39:13.796
Oh, I hope
she don't kill me.

1:39:13.830 --> 1:39:15.030
Will she be mad?

1:39:15.063 --> 1:39:16.766
- I can't make any promises.
- You can't make any promises?

1:39:16.799 --> 1:39:18.166
- No.
- If she tries to kill me,

1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:19.669
it's on you,
I'mma haunt you.

1:39:19.702 --> 1:39:20.770
- Okay. You're gonna haunt me?
- I'm gonna haunt you from the afterlife.

1:39:20.803 --> 1:39:21.838
Okay, cool.

1:39:21.871 --> 1:39:23.438
Here she comes.

1:39:23.472 --> 1:39:24.674
Hey, Ms. Patrice.

1:39:24.707 --> 1:39:26.174
I didn't go in, I promise.

1:39:26.709 --> 1:39:28.645
I believe you.

1:39:28.678 --> 1:39:31.146
Would you like to stay
for dinner, Michael?

1:39:31.179 --> 1:39:33.382
I would. I just have to call my
grandma and make sure it's okay.

1:39:34.349 --> 1:39:36.586
Good. You guys
can come in now.

1:39:52.602 --> 1:39:54.236
What's up?

1:39:54.269 --> 1:39:56.806
I'm going back
to class tomorrow.

1:39:56.839 --> 1:39:59.308
I like Michael, too.

1:39:59.341 --> 1:40:01.510
Look, I did not say anything
about Michael.

1:40:01.543 --> 1:40:02.779
You didn't have to.

1:40:02.812 --> 1:40:04.446
I was 15 before, too.

1:40:08.751 --> 1:40:10.720
Is it my fault
she has to stay?

1:40:12.855 --> 1:40:16.558
No. Your mother is finally
taking responsibility

1:40:16.593 --> 1:40:18.293
and making
a choice for her.

1:40:20.897 --> 1:40:23.231
So what do you think
about Walter?

1:40:24.232 --> 1:40:25.367
I dig him.

1:40:26.468 --> 1:40:27.469
Why?

1:40:28.638 --> 1:40:29.772
Do you
like him again?

1:40:29.806 --> 1:40:31.440
Maybe.

1:40:31.473 --> 1:40:33.308
Yeah, you do.

1:40:35.912 --> 1:40:38.915
Hm, yeah,
you better get some rest

1:40:38.948 --> 1:40:42.551
if I'm dropping you off
to Michael tomorrow.

1:40:42.585 --> 1:40:44.252
- Uh, okay, you know what?
- What?

1:40:45.655 --> 1:40:48.691
It's not Michael,
it's dance.

1:40:48.725 --> 1:40:49.792
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

1:40:49.826 --> 1:40:51.460
- And facing my fears.
- Oh!

1:40:51.493 --> 1:40:53.462
Okay, I'm not
letting others define me.

1:40:53.495 --> 1:40:56.465
Oh. Okay, yeah.

1:40:56.498 --> 1:40:58.367
Yeah, you don't need
socks with that, you're good.

1:40:59.936 --> 1:41:01.136
Dad!

1:41:02.270 --> 1:41:03.338
Hey, son.

1:41:05.708 --> 1:41:07.442
Hey, let me talk to your mom
for a minute, all right?

1:41:07.476 --> 1:41:09.411
All right.

1:41:09.444 --> 1:41:11.413
Hey, don't put too much
milk in, okay?

1:41:11.446 --> 1:41:12.447
Yes, ma'am.

1:41:16.986 --> 1:41:18.220
You want me
to quit?

1:41:18.788 --> 1:41:20.389
- Again?
- Yeah.

1:41:22.391 --> 1:41:25.227
No. Uh, I don't know.

1:41:35.772 --> 1:41:37.907
I've put family
before my dream,

1:41:38.708 --> 1:41:39.742
over me before

1:41:39.776 --> 1:41:41.276
and I still ended up divorced.

1:41:42.679 --> 1:41:43.680
I want both.

1:41:44.446 --> 1:41:45.447
I deserve both.

1:41:52.521 --> 1:41:53.923
I... I think
I'm jealous, babe.

1:41:55.992 --> 1:41:59.829
I've... I've never
had a dream before.

1:42:01.463 --> 1:42:02.397
I mean, not really.

1:42:02.431 --> 1:42:05.768
Not outside of you,
and J.J. and our family.

1:42:06.803 --> 1:42:07.870
Nothing like...

1:42:09.005 --> 1:42:10.773
Boab trees,
just nothing like this...

1:42:10.807 --> 1:42:11.808
You know.

1:42:13.643 --> 1:42:16.344
Listen, it's not too
late to start.

1:42:20.717 --> 1:42:23.285
- It is really scary, you know?
- Oh my God, it's like...

1:42:23.318 --> 1:42:24.553
- Really scary, I can't... Oh, I ain't even gonna lie.
- I swear.

1:42:29.892 --> 1:42:30.927
Hi.

1:42:33.763 --> 1:42:34.764
- Hi
- Come on.

1:42:36.431 --> 1:42:37.432
Hi.

1:42:45.007 --> 1:42:46.408
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

1:42:55.752 --> 1:42:58.453
Do you mind if we have a...
a moment by ourselves

1:42:58.487 --> 1:42:59.655
just before
we sit down to eat?

1:42:59.689 --> 1:43:00.823
Yeah, I'll wait here.

1:43:00.857 --> 1:43:01.858
Okay.

1:43:03.458 --> 1:43:04.459
Come.
Come with me.

1:43:14.637 --> 1:43:15.972
What does
this remind you of?

1:43:18.841 --> 1:43:21.343
When we used to go to that
one park near your school.

1:43:23.780 --> 1:43:27.784
I don't remember the name,
but you used to push me forever.

1:43:29.752 --> 1:43:31.721
Remember when I used to try
to get you off,

1:43:31.754 --> 1:43:34.724
you'd always
throw a temper tantrum?

1:43:34.757 --> 1:43:36.926
I think one time I even threatened
to leave your little butt.

1:43:37.860 --> 1:43:39.896
One time, you did.

1:43:39.929 --> 1:43:42.665
No, I was...
I was hiding behind a tree.

1:43:44.499 --> 1:43:45.701
That was mean.

1:43:50.006 --> 1:43:51.007
Sit down.

1:44:04.854 --> 1:44:06.555
Is staying gonna
help you stop the pills?

1:44:09.558 --> 1:44:10.760
I think so.

1:44:13.763 --> 1:44:14.997
What can I do?

1:44:15.898 --> 1:44:16.899
Be you.

1:44:19.568 --> 1:44:21.003
And maybe
forgive me one day.

1:44:25.041 --> 1:44:26.843
I'm working
on the forgiveness part.

1:44:30.012 --> 1:44:31.379
That's all
I can ask.

1:44:37.019 --> 1:44:38.588
I remember
how you used to be.

1:44:40.990 --> 1:44:42.557
Before the accident.

1:44:46.162 --> 1:44:47.730
It didn't seem bad, but...

1:44:52.034 --> 1:44:53.468
Was I too much?

1:44:56.105 --> 1:45:00.743
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.

1:45:01.844 --> 1:45:03.079
You're not too much.

1:45:05.781 --> 1:45:12.088
I could live a thousand years
and I could never...

1:45:14.223 --> 1:45:15.858
I could never
make it up to you,

1:45:17.593 --> 1:45:20.495
because you and I,
we were a team

1:45:21.664 --> 1:45:23.833
and as the captain,
I let you down.

1:45:26.135 --> 1:45:30.472
But you,
you my sweet girl, you...

1:45:34.043 --> 1:45:35.678
are the best thing
I've ever done

1:45:38.114 --> 1:45:40.548
and none of this is your fault.

1:45:42.919 --> 1:45:44.620
You got that?

1:45:49.025 --> 1:45:51.027
- Got it.
- Good

1:45:55.264 --> 1:45:56.933
Anything else you wanna ask me?

1:46:00.535 --> 1:46:01.536
No.

1:46:05.675 --> 1:46:07.910
You wanna
go find Max?

1:46:07.944 --> 1:46:14.650
Uh... yeah, but um,
first we have a surprise for you.

1:46:16.619 --> 1:46:17.954
You have a surprise
for me?

1:46:27.529 --> 1:46:28.664
It's a good surprise.

1:46:35.604 --> 1:46:36.739
Hi.

1:46:36.772 --> 1:46:38.074
Hi.

1:46:39.141 --> 1:46:41.243
And then what happened?

1:46:41.277 --> 1:46:43.646
Well, your mom
played lookout.

1:46:43.679 --> 1:46:45.047
- Oh yes.
- Oh?

1:46:45.081 --> 1:46:46.215
- Yes, yes.
- Oh my gosh.

1:46:46.248 --> 1:46:49.085
- Yes, wait, she was always lookout.
- Yeah.

1:46:49.118 --> 1:46:51.587
Yes, I was the lookout,
that was my job.

1:46:51.620 --> 1:46:54.657
And I do feel like
I was very good at it.

1:46:54.690 --> 1:46:55.725
I don't believe that.

1:46:55.758 --> 1:46:56.792
That's my point.

1:46:59.929 --> 1:47:01.263
- And this one here.
- Okay.

1:47:01.297 --> 1:47:03.265
This one here got the maddest...

1:47:03.299 --> 1:47:05.801
I think any of us
had ever seen her.

1:47:06.302 --> 1:47:07.670
I did, I did.

1:47:07.703 --> 1:47:10.172
And instead
of picking up one egg,

1:47:10.206 --> 1:47:13.009
I picked up three
and threw them at the same time,

1:47:13.042 --> 1:47:15.911
- which was a big deal for me.
- It was.

1:47:15.945 --> 1:47:19.015
But what she didn't see was
Principal Hargrove coming out.

1:47:19.048 --> 1:47:20.116
Oh, no.

1:47:20.149 --> 1:47:22.218
And then she hit him with his
toupee goes flying.

1:47:22.251 --> 1:47:23.586
His toupee?

1:47:23.619 --> 1:47:26.255
Nobody in the whole school knew we did this.

1:47:27.023 --> 1:47:28.224
Until that moment.

1:47:30.026 --> 1:47:31.961
And then we all
got grounded.

1:47:33.229 --> 1:47:35.097
- Terrible.
- Mom, you were a terrible lookout.

1:47:35.131 --> 1:47:37.266
- Well, at that time, I was.
- That time.

1:47:37.299 --> 1:47:40.236
- But usually...
- No, like most of the time!

1:47:40.269 --> 1:47:41.771
You were never good!

1:47:41.804 --> 1:47:42.872
No, I wasn't!

1:47:42.905 --> 1:47:44.006
Babe, I never knew
this side of you.

1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:45.941
That's because you let them

1:47:45.975 --> 1:47:47.276
and they'll tell
all your business.

1:47:47.309 --> 1:47:49.245
We have tons of stories,
we have so many.

1:47:49.278 --> 1:47:51.080
- Oh my gosh, yes.
- So many.

1:47:51.113 --> 1:47:52.148
Spill.

1:47:53.983 --> 1:47:55.017
What's wrong?

1:47:55.051 --> 1:47:56.719
Okay, either I just peed myself

1:47:56.752 --> 1:47:59.655
or my water just broke.

1:47:59.688 --> 1:48:00.656
- Yeah.
- Oh, let's go.

1:48:00.689 --> 1:48:01.590
- Mm-hm, it's time.
- What?

1:48:01.624 --> 1:48:03.359
It's time!
