00:53.053 --> 00:55.249
Being from California,

00:55.321 --> 00:58.587
I'm well aware
of the skin cancer threat.

00:58.658 --> 01:01.355
Librarians are not known
for their tans.

01:01.428 --> 01:04.364
We're usually pasty white.

01:04.431 --> 01:08.801
Besides, you wouldn't
catch me dead at the beach.

01:17.844 --> 01:21.781
# What am I gonna do
about the sunshine #

01:21.848 --> 01:26.513
# That warms my skin
whenever you're in the room #

01:26.586 --> 01:28.782
# 'Cause my umbrella's
been up forever #

01:28.855 --> 01:31.222
# My winter sweater
fits just fine #

01:31.291 --> 01:34.056
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

01:35.862 --> 01:49.070
# What, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

01:49.142 --> 01:52.601
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

01:55.882 --> 01:59.751
# What am I gonna do
about the music #

01:59.819 --> 02:04.120
# That flows in me when I know
I'm seein' you soon #

02:04.190 --> 02:06.557
# Well, there was a time
my heart was quiet #

02:06.626 --> 02:08.822
# Now I can't stop
listening to it #

02:08.895 --> 02:13.162
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

02:13.233 --> 02:18.069
# Tell me what, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

02:18.138 --> 02:26.774
# What, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

02:26.846 --> 02:29.873
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

02:33.586 --> 02:37.785
# What am I gonna do
about the fresh air #

02:37.857 --> 02:42.090
# That I might feel when you
break my shield in two #

02:42.162 --> 02:44.154
# Well, I once was proud
Look at me now #

02:44.230 --> 02:46.756
# I'm just hanging out
on a limb, yeah #

02:46.833 --> 02:50.793
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

02:50.870 --> 02:55.865
# Tell me what, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

02:55.942 --> 03:04.475
# What, what am I
What am I gonna do, yeah #

03:04.551 --> 03:07.487
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

03:09.355 --> 03:11.847
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

03:13.560 --> 03:16.860
# What am I gonna do, baby
about you #

03:30.243 --> 03:33.907
You worried about
the meeting tomorrow?

03:33.980 --> 03:36.916
I guess that won't help.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.147
No.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.314
Well...

03:42.388 --> 03:44.857
maybe we'll be surprised.

03:51.564 --> 03:56.901
Writer Jorge Luis Borges
likens libraries to paradise.

03:58.771 --> 04:03.436
For me, public libraries
would be a perfect place,

04:03.509 --> 04:05.876
except for one thing.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.449
The public.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.953
Of all the questions
about all the books

04:14.020 --> 04:16.683
on every shelf
in this library,

04:16.755 --> 04:19.521
what do these people ask?

04:19.591 --> 04:21.220
Excuse me.
- Yes?

04:21.293 --> 04:22.728
Where is your bathroom?

04:25.531 --> 04:28.228
Right over there,
behind the stacks.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.806
John Milton wrote
that a good book

04:33.873 --> 04:37.605
is the precious lifeblood
of a master spirit.

04:37.677 --> 04:42.479
And Paul Auster
called reading his comfort...

04:42.548 --> 04:44.779
and his escape.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.757
It's as we feared.
With the budget cuts,

04:52.825 --> 04:55.420
they just can't justify
the satellites.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.691
I'm sorry.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.265
The economy and the internet.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.828
Kind of a double whammy
for librarians.

05:05.905 --> 05:09.933
Jane, are you okay?

05:10.009 --> 05:12.035
Yes, thank you.

05:22.922 --> 05:26.620
Remind me to have you around
the next time I'm fired.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.458
Cool-hand Jane.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.328
You really that okay?

05:32.398 --> 05:36.460
Sorry. I guess I was
just prepared.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.740
You have any plans?

05:42.108 --> 05:45.510
Oh, now, come on, Ms. Taylor.

05:45.578 --> 05:48.343
You can finally reveal to me

05:48.414 --> 05:53.546
one detail
of your private life.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.053
Take a gamble.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.920
I probably won't post it
on the internet.

06:00.860 --> 06:05.355
I'm... I'm leaving
for Costa Rica on Monday.

06:05.431 --> 06:06.990
Costa Rica?

06:07.066 --> 06:09.058
You're serious?

06:09.135 --> 06:11.104
Yeah.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.835
Alone?

06:14.907 --> 06:16.341
Yeah.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.345
Jane the adventurer!

06:19.412 --> 06:23.713
Turns desperation
into a tropical vacation.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.719
Now that's the way
to live, girl!

06:28.821 --> 06:30.983
If a person at death's door

06:31.057 --> 06:34.084
does see her life
flashing before her...

06:34.160 --> 06:38.655
meaningful images,
moments of great beauty...

06:38.731 --> 06:41.098
what could possibly
fly before my eyes

06:41.167 --> 06:43.136
in those final moments?

06:44.804 --> 06:48.400
Where's the beauty
in a wasted life?

06:49.675 --> 06:52.941
And so the point of this trip?

06:53.012 --> 06:56.107
To create some beauty
to play at the end.

06:56.182 --> 06:59.346
To make some pretty memories,

06:59.419 --> 07:03.481
even if it's in a hopeless
11th hour of a pathetic life.

07:23.509 --> 07:28.038
If it seems
a foolish final wish,

07:28.114 --> 07:31.084
well, I haven't done
anything foolish in a while.

07:46.065 --> 07:48.500
The white zone
is for immediate loading

07:48.568 --> 07:50.696
and unloading
of passengers only.

08:11.991 --> 08:17.191
Indeed, dying in beautiful
Costa Rica

08:17.263 --> 08:22.065
may be the most wonderful thing
I've ever done.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.582
Ooh hoo hoo!

09:21.961 --> 09:24.260
That was so beautiful.
- You...

09:24.330 --> 09:25.855
You are so beautiful.

09:25.932 --> 09:26.865
You can stay.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.697
No, no, no, no.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.999
You should go home
to your life.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.904
We will always have this.
Always.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.708
Oops. I must go home.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.962
Okay, that's it. You can see
the ocean from the balcony.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.932
If you need anything,
just ask, okay?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.263
Okay.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.930
Pura vida.

10:05.004 --> 10:09.965
Oh, "pura vida" is what we say
instead of "hello" or "goodbye."

10:10.042 --> 10:12.136
It means "pure living,
pure life."

10:13.713 --> 10:15.341
Oh, that way, please.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.815
Pura vida.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.272
Time for English, Papi.

10:44.343 --> 10:45.834
Yes, please.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.681
So what's your word for today?

10:54.754 --> 10:56.313
Today is...

10:56.389 --> 10:59.086
Uh, "capricious."

10:59.158 --> 11:02.356
"Given to sudden changes
of mood or behavior."

11:02.428 --> 11:03.623
Ca-prish-es.

11:03.696 --> 11:05.130
Cap-ree-cious.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.358
Ah. Cap-ree-cious.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.661
Capricious.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.827
Cap-ree-cious.

13:19.231 --> 13:21.257
Morning.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.494
Good morning.

13:22.568 --> 13:26.164
Are you going
to the park today?

13:26.238 --> 13:27.729
Yes.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.504
It's best if you hire a guide.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.437
Oh. Okay.

13:33.512 --> 13:37.745
They should charge you
no more than $40 for the tour.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.786
- $40?
- Yes.

13:40.853 --> 13:41.877
Okay.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.976
Okay.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.377
I have accessed the creature.

14:07.446 --> 14:08.539
Please.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.313
Mmm.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.613
Excuse me, ma'am,
do you need a guide?

15:17.683 --> 15:20.175
I think so.
How long does it take?

15:20.252 --> 15:23.051
Well, unlike the others
over there,

15:23.122 --> 15:24.920
I like to be very detailed

15:24.990 --> 15:26.583
and show you
every amazing thing.

15:26.659 --> 15:30.357
I try not to be, uh,
cap-rish-us or capricious.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.125
Okay, that's good.
- Okay.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.393
I also feature
the Fujinon 80 telescope,

15:34.466 --> 15:36.128
the very, very, very best.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.636
I can get you a close-up of
a sloth 200 feet up in the tree.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.969
You can see his nose hairs.
- Good.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.908
Yeah, and you get this
and all my acute knowledge,

15:43.976 --> 15:47.276
beneficial for you,
for only $75,

15:47.346 --> 15:49.906
for more than three hours
of benevolent work.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.644
75?

15:51.717 --> 15:53.652
Yes. The others
only go two hours.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.382
And it's for
my acute knowledge.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.653
It's not, uh, capricious or...
- Okay, good.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.216
Good.
- I'm hired?

16:01.293 --> 16:04.161
Yes.
- Oh, thank you! I'm Juan.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.663
Uh, Jane.

16:05.731 --> 16:10.465
Oh, Jane, what a beautiful name.
It's very accessible.

16:10.536 --> 16:11.663
Where are you from, Jane?

16:11.737 --> 16:13.330
Uh, Los Angeles.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.965
Los Angeles City.
When you're here,

16:16.041 --> 16:19.409
there is one less angel
in the City of Angels.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.174
Yes, yes, yes.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.477
Okay, we will begin.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.618
You're gonna get
inside the jungle,

16:32.691 --> 16:36.093
and you're gonna see
monkeys, birds,

16:36.161 --> 16:38.687
uh, a lot of kinds of animals.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.700
It's gonna be great.
You're gonna love it.

16:57.783 --> 17:01.049
So what kind of work do you do
in Los Angeles, Jane?

17:01.120 --> 17:02.679
I'm a librarian.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.724
You work in a library?

17:05.790 --> 17:07.555
Uh, not anymore.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.026
Oh, you quit.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.029
It closed.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.724
They closed a library
in America?

17:13.799 --> 17:16.132
I can't believe it.
- The economy.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.501
That's terrible. I love books.

17:19.570 --> 17:21.733
I should read
more of them anyway.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.570
But I love them.

17:23.642 --> 17:26.578
This park is only
six kilometers, three miles,

17:26.645 --> 17:29.046
one of the smallest
natural parks in the world.

17:29.114 --> 17:33.575
But for our size, we have more
species of mammals here, 109,

17:33.652 --> 17:36.019
and more kinds of birds, 184,

17:36.088 --> 17:39.422
than any other park
in the world.

17:39.491 --> 17:40.584
Look.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.458
These are my favorite.
Good.

17:46.832 --> 17:49.597
Okay.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.160
I have accessed the creature.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.603
Please.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.776
See?
- Oh. Ohh!

17:58.844 --> 18:01.336
We affectionately call them
"osos perezosos."

18:01.413 --> 18:02.779
It means "lazy bears."

18:02.848 --> 18:05.613
The sloths can sleep
for up to 18 hours a day.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.778
They are the slowest mammals
on earth,

18:07.853 --> 18:09.788
moving about
six feet per minute.

18:09.855 --> 18:13.758
It would take him almost a month
to walk just one mile.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.728
They are a true aberration
of nature.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.629
They're so beautiful.

18:19.698 --> 18:22.793
How often do they come down?

18:22.868 --> 18:25.428
About once a week
to go to the bathroom.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.439
The only explanation
is that they fear

18:27.506 --> 18:29.634
that if they go to the bathroom
in the trees,

18:29.708 --> 18:31.199
their predators
may hear them,

18:31.276 --> 18:35.304
so they hold it in
and go on the ground,

18:35.380 --> 18:37.246
bury it and cover it
with leaves.

18:37.316 --> 18:40.753
It is interesting.
During the mating season,

18:40.819 --> 18:42.811
the female will scream
to attract the male,

18:42.888 --> 18:47.792
and it sounds just like
a woman screaming when...

18:47.860 --> 18:50.625
when, you know,
when she's...

18:50.696 --> 18:52.631
when she is loved, eh?

18:52.698 --> 18:54.826
Oh, yes.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.165
Uh, okay.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.203
Bueno.

19:11.917 --> 19:15.445
This is a special treat.
These are rare.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.183
For their size,

19:17.256 --> 19:20.420
they are considered the most
intelligent of all primates.

19:20.492 --> 19:23.621
That's one of the reasons
of their small number.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.459
Many people take them as pets

19:25.531 --> 19:29.195
because they are so smart and
get along with people so well.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.100
What a pity.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.866
Let's go.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.880
Are you enjoying the tour?
I try to make it actualizing.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.425
Yes, it's very good.
Thank you.

20:00.265 --> 20:04.498
I guess you become very quiet
working in a library.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.301
Do you have any family?

20:07.372 --> 20:08.465
No.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.667
No kids?

20:09.741 --> 20:10.902
No.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.535
I guess no husband.

20:12.611 --> 20:13.909
Ever been married?

20:13.979 --> 20:15.413
No.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.312
Hmm.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.941
Should we, um...

20:21.220 --> 20:23.382
Should we continue the tour?

20:23.455 --> 20:28.519
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
I'm almost finished.

20:28.594 --> 20:31.564
More animals come out
as it gets later, you know?

20:33.999 --> 20:35.934
Well...

20:36.001 --> 20:38.197
I have a daughter, Anna.

20:38.270 --> 20:41.707
Oh, she's very smart.
Very smart.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.435
Her English is perfect.
She reads a lot.

20:43.508 --> 20:44.737
That's good.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.405
Yeah. I send her
to the American school.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.778
Very expensive. Wow!

20:49.848 --> 20:52.249
But she can become
something special.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.842
Maybe a lawyer.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.548
She wants to be a doctor.

20:56.622 --> 20:57.988
Yes.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.460
She's a lot smarter than I am,

21:02.527 --> 21:04.462
but she doesn't rub it in
too much.

21:04.529 --> 21:06.498
Just a little.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.731
I guess Los Angeles
is a fun city, yes?

21:10.802 --> 21:14.204
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.299
Did you ever meet
any of the Kardashians?

21:16.375 --> 21:17.968
Who?

21:18.043 --> 21:20.911
You know, Kim Karadashian
and her sisters,

21:20.979 --> 21:22.743
mother, Bruce Jenner.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.544
No. I don't know them.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.312
Kim was the one
married for 72 days.

21:26.385 --> 21:27.785
No.
- You didn't hear that?

21:27.853 --> 21:28.980
No.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.717
Oh. That's weird.

21:31.790 --> 21:36.455
I think you're too smart
to know them, you know?

21:36.528 --> 21:37.996
What do you like
to do for fun?

21:38.063 --> 21:41.795
Uh, well, um...
- Yeah?

21:41.867 --> 21:43.802
I read and I walk.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.600
Oh, that's...

21:46.672 --> 21:48.265
smart.

21:48.340 --> 21:49.740
Yes.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.776
Can I do anything different
in this last part?

21:56.581 --> 21:58.015
Uh, no, okay, never mind,
it's fine.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.642
It's fine.
- Come on, Jane, say it.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.277
I can see in your eyes
you want to say something.

22:01.353 --> 22:02.912
I always want to be better.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.786
Well, it's just, I...

22:04.856 --> 22:08.020
I'm used to more space.
More...

22:08.093 --> 22:10.028
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

22:10.095 --> 22:14.032
I'll make sure we stay away
from others, hmm? Okay?

22:15.667 --> 22:18.637
Oh. That's not what you meant.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.832
What did you mean, Jane?
Please say.

22:20.906 --> 22:24.343
Say it to me. Come on.

22:24.409 --> 22:28.870
Well, it's just sometimes you
just get a little bit too close.

22:28.947 --> 22:31.849
Oh, ah, I see.
- Okay?

22:31.917 --> 22:35.285
Oh. I'm sorry.
You know...

22:35.354 --> 22:37.289
It's just my love
for what I do.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.052
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry.

22:39.124 --> 22:42.526
And down here, you know,
we are used to getting close.

22:42.594 --> 22:44.460
Yeah, okay.
- Being touchy.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.622
Yes.
- You know?

22:45.697 --> 22:46.892
Lovely.
- We're Latinos.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.627
Okay. That's great.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.362
Yes.

22:50.435 --> 22:53.064
Okay, but I'm sorry.
I won't get so close, okay?

22:53.138 --> 22:55.334
Okay.
- Look! Here!

22:55.407 --> 22:56.466
Okay?
- Okay.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.066
We can talk from here, okay?

22:58.143 --> 23:01.079
Sure.
- And I can see you here.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.382
No problem.
Come on, Jane.

23:04.449 --> 23:05.712
See? That was easy.
- Okay.

23:05.784 --> 23:08.083
No problem. Okay.
- I'm fulfilled.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.122
Let's see some beauty!

23:25.170 --> 23:26.729
His colors are amazing, yes?

23:26.805 --> 23:30.107
Yes.

23:30.175 --> 23:32.144
Okay? Okay.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.576
Let's go. Thank you.

23:37.649 --> 23:40.448
Be careful here, Jane.

23:40.519 --> 23:43.114
Can I help you? Uh...

23:43.188 --> 23:45.350
Grab it, grab it here.
Grab it.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.588
Okay, okay, okay.
Perfect.

24:00.472 --> 24:01.599
Oh.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.636
Look.

24:04.709 --> 24:07.406
This is the Guaria Morada,
the flower of Costa Rica.

24:07.479 --> 24:09.141
Beautiful.

24:09.214 --> 24:13.117
Its beauty represents
the beauty of Costa Rican women.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.483
Smell it.

24:14.553 --> 24:17.079
Do you notice that?

24:17.155 --> 24:19.647
No perfume could
match that, huh?

24:21.226 --> 24:23.923
We believe that
when you breathe it in,

24:23.995 --> 24:26.590
it brings you
peace and good luck.

24:26.665 --> 24:30.067
Yeah. Now I know
you will have it.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.664
Did I do pretty good?
- Yeah, you did great.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.468
No, when I wasn't too touchy.
- Yeah.

24:35.540 --> 24:36.473
Yes?
- Great.

24:36.541 --> 24:38.976
Okay, okay.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.842
Let's go.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.188
Oh. Yes.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.123
Uh, yes.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.129
70, 75.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.464
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

25:05.537 --> 25:08.200
Did you enjoy the tour?
It was... beneficial?

25:08.273 --> 25:12.142
Yes, it was very nice.
You're a very good guide.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.701
Oh, thank you.
My pleasure.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.872
I was thinking
you didn't bring a camera.

25:15.947 --> 25:18.212
I could have gotten some nice
pictures of you to remember,

25:18.283 --> 25:20.218
like you smelling
the Guaria Morada.

25:20.285 --> 25:21.878
Ah, what a pity.

25:21.953 --> 25:25.048
It's all up here.
- Yes.

25:25.123 --> 25:27.854
I can drive you to your hotel.
Where are you staying?

25:27.926 --> 25:30.828
Oh, no, really,
it's just down the beach.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.831
It's the first hotel
on the beach.

25:32.898 --> 25:34.560
It's a nice walk.
- I have a van.

25:34.633 --> 25:37.159
Plenty of space for yourself.

25:37.235 --> 25:38.828
No, no, really,
thank you.

25:38.904 --> 25:41.703
Okay, okay, I'll let you go.
Let's go.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.969
Start raining.come on.
- Okay.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.511
Gracias. Pura vida.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.069
I'm just wondering,
you're planning to see

25:48.146 --> 25:50.741
other beautiful things
in Costa Rica,

25:50.815 --> 25:52.875
maybe the whole eco tour, yes?

25:52.951 --> 25:55.250
Yeah, I guess so.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.846
I have a van,
and I do all places:

25:57.923 --> 26:00.518
Arenal, volcano, waterfall,
the orchids.

26:00.592 --> 26:02.493
I could make you good deal.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.826
I'm not really sure
of my schedule right now.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.694
Okay, okay, I understand.

26:06.765 --> 26:09.860
Can I give you my number
just in case if you decide?

26:09.935 --> 26:10.994
Okay, thank you.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.162
Okay.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.603
Pura vida.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.315
What's the point?

26:25.350 --> 26:28.149
The good moments never last.

26:32.290 --> 26:36.125
I have no one to blame
for this separation but myself.

26:39.197 --> 26:42.599
It's as if I received a shot
that forever numbed me.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.667
Only I gave myself that shot.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.341
Jane?

27:34.419 --> 27:37.287
Jane, it's Juan,
the tour guide.

27:43.061 --> 27:45.257
Please go away.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.356
I'm very busy.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.867
Uh, please,
I don't want to bother,

27:49.934 --> 27:52.403
but I needed
to talk with you.

27:55.273 --> 27:59.142
I... told you...

27:59.210 --> 28:03.875
if I needed a guide,
I would call you.

28:03.948 --> 28:08.409
Please, Jane, please.
It's gonna be just a minute.

28:28.306 --> 28:29.433
Oh...

28:39.951 --> 28:44.047
Jane, please.
We could sit just out here.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.017
Yes?

28:53.264 --> 28:58.464
I want to apologize
for being churlish on your tour.

29:01.172 --> 29:03.107
You weren't churlish.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.143
No, I think I was.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.451
Churlish would mean
you were vulgar.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.180
You weren't vulgar.

29:15.253 --> 29:20.453
Well, but I was difficult
to work or deal with

29:20.525 --> 29:22.460
in the moments when
I did not give you space,

29:22.527 --> 29:26.259
so I was a little churlish.

29:26.331 --> 29:29.301
Well, I didn't think so.

29:29.367 --> 29:31.859
That's not why you're here.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.768
Uh, no, no, no.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.466
Ohh...

29:35.540 --> 29:38.772
I didn't want to bother you,
but you do need a guide,

29:38.843 --> 29:41.278
and my situation
is not too good.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.781
I told you about my daughter
in the American school.

29:43.848 --> 29:45.476
She's doing so great,
really great,

29:45.550 --> 29:49.487
but the tourists have slowed
down here with your economy.

29:49.554 --> 29:53.286
You know this problem?
- Yes.

29:53.358 --> 29:57.454
I know money may not
be easy for you, but...

29:57.529 --> 30:00.397
you came to see Costa Rica
planning to hire a guide,

30:00.465 --> 30:02.263
am I right?

30:02.333 --> 30:04.063
Yeah, I guess so.

30:04.135 --> 30:07.299
And it would just help me a lot
with my daughter's school

30:07.372 --> 30:10.467
if I could be
your personal guide.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.909
Do you understand me?

30:12.977 --> 30:18.746
Yes, but I've changed my mind.

30:18.817 --> 30:22.754
I just... I wanna stay here
at the hotel and rest.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.518
Oh, but...

30:25.590 --> 30:27.320
But you can't do that here.

30:27.392 --> 30:29.520
I saw how your face lights up

30:29.594 --> 30:32.257
when you see
all the amazing things.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.492
You just can't come
to Costa Rica and rest.

30:34.566 --> 30:38.526
How much money do you need
for the school?

30:38.603 --> 30:42.267
I'm sorry,
but it's not your worry.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.868
Please, it's okay.

30:45.944 --> 30:48.539
Just tell me how much.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.844
About $500.

30:50.915 --> 30:53.248
Okay, I'll give you the money.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.489
You would just give me $500
for nothing?

31:00.625 --> 31:02.924
It's for your daughter's school.

31:16.407 --> 31:18.035
No, no, I can't take it.

31:18.109 --> 31:19.407
Please.
I want you to have it.

31:19.477 --> 31:21.207
No, please, Jane.
- It's okay.

31:21.279 --> 31:25.148
No, no, no, I didn't come
for a charity gift.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.412
No. Ehh...

31:27.485 --> 31:31.081
Only if I give you
another tour.

31:31.155 --> 31:33.420
That's the only way
that it's right.

31:33.491 --> 31:34.424
Ehh?

31:34.492 --> 31:36.825
Come on, Jane.

31:36.895 --> 31:41.424
You came to Costa Rica
to see the beauty, yes?

31:41.499 --> 31:44.469
Yeah, I guess so.

31:48.506 --> 31:49.872
Are you okay?

31:51.142 --> 31:52.940
Yeah.

31:53.011 --> 31:55.606
What are the things
you wish to see?

31:55.680 --> 31:58.240
Come on, tell me.
- Well...

31:58.316 --> 32:02.617
I've heard the crocodiles...

32:02.687 --> 32:08.354
in Rio Tarc... Tarcoles,
something,

32:08.426 --> 32:10.361
are really worthwhile.

32:10.428 --> 32:13.557
Yes! They are
incredibly worthwhile.

32:13.631 --> 32:15.623
Absolutely. What else?

32:15.700 --> 32:20.638
There's an orchid
that smells like chocolate.

32:20.705 --> 32:23.038
Yes, the Sharri Baby Hybrid.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.633
I know where you can find them.
It's near the crocodiles.

32:25.710 --> 32:26.871
What else?

32:26.945 --> 32:30.313
I've read about Puerto Viejo.

32:30.381 --> 32:33.317
Oh, the Caribbean side.
Beautiful, beautiful.

32:33.384 --> 32:36.616
We will find you your own beach
to get a perfect tan.

32:38.022 --> 32:40.924
Oh, you don't want a tan?
- No.

32:40.992 --> 32:44.451
Okay, no tan, eh?

32:45.730 --> 32:48.962
You should say okay.

32:49.033 --> 32:51.502
Please, Jane.

32:51.569 --> 32:52.969
Please.

32:55.673 --> 32:57.665
Okay.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.608
Thank you, Jane.

33:01.245 --> 33:02.440
Pura vida.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.483
Are you okay? Yes?

33:06.551 --> 33:08.019
See you tomorrow.

33:08.086 --> 33:09.645
Bye. Bye.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.715
I guess he's right.

33:37.782 --> 33:41.048
I did come here to see more.

33:41.119 --> 33:42.712
Doesn't exactly
make much sense

33:42.787 --> 33:46.656
to take a shortcut
on a final shortcut.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.439
Choos-pah?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.036
Choos-pah.

34:10.114 --> 34:11.547
Choos-pah?

34:16.320 --> 34:17.686
Choos-pah.

35:01.799 --> 35:02.823
Hey.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.170
Please.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.024
Puta carro.

35:32.096 --> 35:34.395
I fix it in a minute, Jane.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.457
Just gonna be a minute.

35:37.902 --> 35:41.168
Okay. Let's see
what happened here.

35:41.239 --> 35:44.403
Oh, we're gonna see now
some crocodiles at Rio Tarcoles.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.467
And we'll get
so close to them, so...

35:46.544 --> 35:48.843
we will show
lots of choos-pah.

35:48.913 --> 35:50.848
I'm sorry, what?

35:50.915 --> 35:52.144
What?

35:52.216 --> 35:53.343
What did you say?

35:53.417 --> 35:55.147
Uh, choos-pah.

35:55.219 --> 35:56.687
Is that a Spanish word?

35:56.754 --> 36:00.191
No. I believe it's Hebrew.
Choos-pah.

36:00.258 --> 36:03.592
Chutzpah.
- Chutzpah, yeah, chutzpah.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.789
I guess it sounds different
with my accent.

36:05.863 --> 36:07.695
Oh!

36:07.765 --> 36:09.893
Oh...

36:11.936 --> 36:15.634
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
It's everything okay.

36:16.941 --> 36:19.172
I'm sure you have read
so many books.

36:19.243 --> 36:21.644
Did you count how many?

36:21.712 --> 36:24.307
Uh, I don't know. Maybe.

36:24.382 --> 36:28.114
How many do you think?
- I don't know.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.519
Are my questions bothering you?
I like words, you know.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.614
No. They're fine.
- Okay. Okay.

36:32.690 --> 36:36.889
How long does it usually
take you to read a book?

36:36.961 --> 36:39.624
I don't know.
- More or less.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.326
It depends on the book,
you know?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.198
It could be a day,
it could be two days.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.499
If it's a really, really rich...

36:46.571 --> 36:49.666
you know, like a rich novel
with lots of rich language,

36:49.740 --> 36:53.734
it could be, I don't know,
it could be a week.

36:53.811 --> 36:56.508
And for how long
have you been doing that?

36:58.482 --> 37:01.350
Well, I've been reading
at least, uh,

37:01.419 --> 37:05.186
a book a week
for 40 years.

37:05.256 --> 37:06.690
Oh.

37:08.292 --> 37:10.591
40 years.

37:10.661 --> 37:12.926
Even if I give you
two weeks off for vacation,

37:12.997 --> 37:16.525
and you read 50 books a year,

37:16.601 --> 37:20.333
that would be...
2.000 books in 40 years.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.838
Eee-my!

37:21.906 --> 37:23.898
That could be a record.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.705
I guess it does add up.

37:25.776 --> 37:27.870
Well, I told you.
I like words.

37:27.945 --> 37:29.709
I'm not too big
on the books.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.772
You could just
pick up one and start.

37:31.849 --> 37:33.215
Yeah, I will, I will.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.253
I want to start
with the best book ever.

37:35.319 --> 37:37.345
Since you have read them all,
which is the best one?

37:39.357 --> 37:40.689
Why is that funny?

37:40.758 --> 37:44.217
No, it's just...
That's...

37:44.295 --> 37:46.958
an impossible question.
- Why?

37:47.031 --> 37:48.795
'Cause there's so many
different kinds.

37:48.866 --> 37:51.426
There's fantasy, there's action,
there's mystery.

37:51.502 --> 37:52.970
Oh, I see.
- There's romance.

37:53.037 --> 37:56.269
What's the best love story
you read?

37:56.340 --> 37:59.936
Okay, the best love story
I ever read...

38:00.011 --> 38:02.606
probably was
Tale of Two Cities.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.649
Tale of Two Cities.
Tale of Two Cities.

38:04.715 --> 38:06.707
Who wrote that?

38:06.784 --> 38:08.980
Charles Dickens.
- Charles Dickens.

38:09.053 --> 38:11.579
Tale of Two Cities.
Charles... Charles Dickens.

38:11.656 --> 38:12.988
Tale of Two Cities.
Charles Dickens.

38:13.057 --> 38:15.652
I'll make sure
that I read it one day.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.592
Good.
- You know...

38:17.662 --> 38:20.222
I'm Latin. I ask you
all these questions about this.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.733
You know why?
- Why?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.598
It made you laugh.

38:24.669 --> 38:28.265
You should laugh on vacation,
even if it's at stupid me.

38:28.339 --> 38:30.001
Okay.

38:30.074 --> 38:33.511
Now I'll shut up, fix it,

38:33.577 --> 38:35.978
and we'll go see
some crocodiles.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.515
Okay.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.398
Come on, Jane,
come on, come on.

39:46.083 --> 39:47.073
Ah!

39:55.159 --> 39:58.095
I wonder if I can feed myself
to the wildlife

39:58.162 --> 40:00.131
from here up on the bridge.

40:05.703 --> 40:08.434
Would I wind up
as a pair of boots?

40:08.506 --> 40:11.135
Or a handbag?

40:13.077 --> 40:15.376
Or maybe a belt?

40:15.446 --> 40:20.680
Go on, boys,
make me an accessory.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.344
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.514
Whoa. Sorry, sorry,

40:24.588 --> 40:28.525
but I don't want to find you
in a crocodile soup.

40:28.592 --> 40:32.154
Come on. I have
a better view for you, yes?

40:40.938 --> 40:45.069
Jane, please.
It's not safe.

40:45.142 --> 40:47.111
Okay, come on.

40:58.222 --> 41:01.192
You need to have this one.
Good photo.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.650
I'm enjoying my final tour.

41:38.262 --> 41:40.231
Really, I am.

41:43.067 --> 41:47.630
There's comfort in knowing
I'm never going home.

41:51.709 --> 41:56.807
Unlikely as it may have seemed,
I'm going out on a high.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.461
See?

42:17.535 --> 42:20.027
This place is special, eh?

42:20.104 --> 42:22.039
Regular tour guides
won't take you here.

42:22.106 --> 42:25.565
It's for ticos, locals.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.908
Tourist places are
restaurantes.

42:27.978 --> 42:31.176
We call this kinda place a soda,
like the soda you drink.

42:31.248 --> 42:33.843
You know?
- Hmm.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.819
Pura vida.
- Uh, no, thank you.

42:35.886 --> 42:38.219
I don't drink.
- Oh, no, you're in Costa Rica.

42:38.289 --> 42:40.224
You should try our Imperial.

42:40.291 --> 42:43.921
Come on, show some of that
North American chutzpah.

42:43.994 --> 42:47.021
Okay, maybe just one sip.

42:47.097 --> 42:48.622
Pura vida.

42:52.336 --> 42:54.498
Hmm? You like it?

42:54.572 --> 42:55.540
Yeah.

42:55.606 --> 42:56.767
You're right.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.809
It's nice. It's light.

43:00.978 --> 43:03.709
You do a lot of writing.
It is your diary?

43:03.781 --> 43:05.249
Mm. Mm-mm.

43:05.316 --> 43:07.182
It's my journal.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.277
I guess I'm in there now.

43:09.353 --> 43:11.686
I hope I'm not a clown.

43:11.755 --> 43:14.281
I'd be embarrassed if Anna
reads your book one day

43:14.358 --> 43:20.195
and her father is the fool
who was too touchy, you know?

43:20.264 --> 43:22.631
You must see
the Caribbean coast.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.761
It's a very different world
with the Rastas.

43:25.836 --> 43:28.897
Do you know Rastas?
- Rastafarians?

43:28.973 --> 43:32.307
Yes. I guess this is
the long name, Rastafarians.

43:32.376 --> 43:36.313
Oh. Gracias.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.939
We call this casados.

43:38.015 --> 43:39.210
Casados means marriage,

43:39.283 --> 43:40.911
and this is
a marriage of our foods.

43:40.985 --> 43:42.954
It's rice, beans,

43:43.020 --> 43:45.615
plantain and local fish,
mahi-mahi.

43:45.689 --> 43:46.748
Very good.

43:46.824 --> 43:49.089
It's casados in the soda.

43:49.159 --> 43:52.561
Yes! Very good, very good!

43:52.630 --> 43:53.928
Come on.

43:57.835 --> 43:59.997
Mix it. Come on.

44:00.070 --> 44:02.164
It's messy.
- Mix it.

44:02.239 --> 44:03.798
Okay, very good, very good.

44:03.874 --> 44:05.365
That's right.

44:10.414 --> 44:12.315
Nice?

44:17.054 --> 44:18.352
Beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

44:18.422 --> 44:22.189
You can put Tabasco
if you want.

44:24.228 --> 44:29.189
You could show some real
chutzpah and go for number 4.

44:29.266 --> 44:31.963
I think I showed enough
"hoot-spa"

44:32.036 --> 44:34.301
going for numbers 1, 2 and 3.

44:34.371 --> 44:36.897
That's right, that's right.

46:55.179 --> 46:56.203
Jane?

46:59.583 --> 47:00.551
Jane?

47:03.020 --> 47:04.454
Whew.

47:05.589 --> 47:07.114
Jane!

47:09.593 --> 47:12.028
Jane! Hey!

47:12.095 --> 47:15.156
It was a beautiful day, yes?
Yes!

47:15.232 --> 47:18.168
Okay, tomorrow we go to Arenal,
the volcano.

47:18.235 --> 47:19.999
You should bring
good walking shoes.

47:20.070 --> 47:21.538
Not being touchy.

47:21.605 --> 47:25.372
Just want to make sure
the three beers are mostly gone.

47:25.442 --> 47:27.775
Okay.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.541
Tomorrow should be early.

47:29.613 --> 47:32.014
Is 7:00, 8:00 okay?

47:32.082 --> 47:33.380
Okay, yes, thank you.

47:33.450 --> 47:35.578
Okay. Good night, then.

47:40.891 --> 47:42.587
Pura vida.

48:53.297 --> 48:55.357
She told you to read that?

48:55.432 --> 48:59.426
No. I just wanted to read it.
Is that so strange?

48:59.503 --> 49:04.464
Yes! This is
your first book... ever.

49:04.541 --> 49:06.942
Is she pretty?
- Who?

49:07.010 --> 49:08.638
The librarian.

49:08.712 --> 49:11.147
I don't know. Maybe.

49:11.214 --> 49:13.911
How don't you know?
You look at her, don't you?

49:13.984 --> 49:17.648
Yeah, but I guess I just see
how smart she is.

49:17.721 --> 49:22.489
That's so sweet, but that means
she's not very pretty.

49:32.035 --> 49:37.372
Fitting in is a habit you
either develop early or not.

49:42.012 --> 49:44.106
There'd be nothing
more pathetic

49:44.181 --> 49:47.640
than attempting it now.

49:47.718 --> 49:49.687
Sitting amongst them
would make it more obvious

49:49.753 --> 49:52.655
what a complete freak I am.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.265
Did you go out last night?

50:05.335 --> 50:07.702
Well, I went out on the beach
for a while.

50:07.771 --> 50:11.708
Oh, what a beautiful night.
So many stars, yes?

50:11.775 --> 50:14.506
Yes. I'm not used
to seeing so many.

50:14.578 --> 50:17.548
You don't see them
in Los Angeles?

50:17.614 --> 50:19.947
No. The city lights
are too bright.

50:20.017 --> 50:22.714
And... smog.

50:22.786 --> 50:25.950
Oh, that's too bad.

50:26.023 --> 50:30.393
I guess at least you can see
the other stars in Los Angeles.

50:30.460 --> 50:31.985
Who have you seen?

50:32.062 --> 50:34.395
Nobody.

50:34.464 --> 50:37.366
None I know.

50:37.434 --> 50:38.766
It's ridiculous.

50:48.378 --> 50:50.210
Anything wrong?

50:50.280 --> 50:52.340
It's very fun.
- Uh...

50:52.416 --> 50:55.079
Yeah?
- I'm not... I'm...

50:55.152 --> 50:57.644
I'm not really sure
about this.

50:57.721 --> 51:00.020
Come on, Jane.
You will like it.

51:00.090 --> 51:03.652
Uh, no, I'm...

51:03.727 --> 51:05.195
I'm sorry.

51:06.263 --> 51:07.663
I'm sorry.

51:07.731 --> 51:10.599
Jane, you do different things
on vacation.

51:10.667 --> 51:13.227
You are on vacation.
That's why you came, right?

51:13.303 --> 51:14.771
Come on, Jane.
That's why you came.

51:14.838 --> 51:17.774
No! That's not why I came.

51:22.646 --> 51:24.581
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry to push.

51:24.648 --> 51:25.775
We can go.

51:27.250 --> 51:29.082
Sure? Are you sure?

51:29.152 --> 51:30.780
No, no. No vamos.

51:30.854 --> 51:32.755
That's fine. We can go.

51:32.823 --> 51:34.416
No, wait. No, wait.

51:35.859 --> 51:37.521
Okay.

51:37.594 --> 51:39.119
You sure, Jane?

51:39.196 --> 51:41.062
Yeah.

51:41.131 --> 51:43.066
Come on.
- It's gonna be wonderful.

51:49.339 --> 51:51.308
Put that foot right here.

51:52.876 --> 51:54.276
Okay.

51:55.812 --> 51:57.644
Okay, your left.

52:00.684 --> 52:02.084
You will like it, Jane.

52:03.553 --> 52:05.146
I'll place this on the back.

52:05.222 --> 52:07.248
He has to touch you
just a little bit

52:07.324 --> 52:10.123
to put, you know,
the belt.

52:10.193 --> 52:11.718
Doesn't matter.
- Okay, okay, okay.

52:11.795 --> 52:14.162
Okay?
- Okay, I'm good, I'm good.

52:19.636 --> 52:22.663
Okay.
- Hold it right here.

52:22.739 --> 52:24.230
It's gonna be fun.

52:24.307 --> 52:25.832
Let's go!

52:25.909 --> 52:28.242
I'm gonna be first, okay?
- Okay.

52:28.311 --> 52:30.246
So you can see me.

52:30.313 --> 52:31.838
Okay.

53:07.951 --> 53:09.214
Oh!

53:18.795 --> 53:21.629
Jane! Jane! Jane!

53:21.698 --> 53:22.927
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

53:39.649 --> 53:42.881
I'm really sorry
to push you before.

53:42.953 --> 53:46.651
Do you forgive me?
- Yes.

53:46.723 --> 53:49.215
You scare me
playing race car driver.

53:49.292 --> 53:50.885
And you're okay?

53:50.961 --> 53:53.226
I'm fine. I'm sorry.
I just got distracted.

53:53.296 --> 53:55.765
But everything is okay now.

53:55.832 --> 53:56.959
Yeah.

54:02.639 --> 54:05.609
In Los Angeles,
do you have any animals?

54:06.943 --> 54:10.937
I have... a cat...

54:11.014 --> 54:12.505
named Sydney.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.881
Sydney?
Like Sydney Carton?

54:14.951 --> 54:17.182
I've started reading

54:17.254 --> 54:19.246
the greatest love story
in history.

54:19.322 --> 54:21.757
Thank you very much.
I cannot stop reading it.

54:21.825 --> 54:23.726
You went to the library?

54:23.793 --> 54:25.955
Oh, yeah, yeah, well,

54:26.029 --> 54:28.965
I kind of tricked you
on your third Imperial.

54:29.032 --> 54:33.993
When we went to the town,
I went to the library.

54:37.507 --> 54:38.975
You could've told me.

54:39.042 --> 54:40.977
Yes, I know.
It was stupid.

54:41.044 --> 54:44.606
Anyway, I love the book.
I'm only halfway.

54:44.681 --> 54:45.979
The French Revolution?

54:46.049 --> 54:47.881
Oh, I didn't know anything
about that.

54:47.951 --> 54:49.249
It's amazing!

54:49.319 --> 54:51.754
Maybe If I finish it
before you leave,

54:51.821 --> 54:52.982
we can talk about it.

54:53.056 --> 54:53.989
Is that okay?

54:54.057 --> 54:55.787
Yeah.

54:55.859 --> 54:59.694
See? I knew book talk
would make you happy.

55:04.034 --> 55:07.562
Now you can hear it.

55:07.637 --> 55:08.969
Let's go.

55:27.090 --> 55:29.491
Sorry, but you must have
these pictures.

55:29.559 --> 55:31.824
Follow me.

55:42.939 --> 55:45.033
Be careful. Yeah.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.055
We should go.

56:05.128 --> 56:07.097
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

56:27.150 --> 56:28.982
I'm sorry about the couple.

56:29.052 --> 56:32.887
I should have been more,
uh, circumspect.

56:32.956 --> 56:34.822
It's okay.
- Okay.

56:34.891 --> 56:36.120
Pura vida.

56:40.163 --> 56:42.723
Ahh...

56:42.799 --> 56:45.928
I love the book.
Yeah, I'm learning history,

56:46.002 --> 56:49.029
and I'm beginning to see
why you like the love story.

56:49.105 --> 56:50.869
It is complicated.

56:50.940 --> 56:54.900
Lucy love Charles,
but Sydney's crazy about Lucy.

56:54.978 --> 56:57.106
I don't know
what will happen.

56:57.180 --> 56:59.081
Maybe Sydney
will kill Charles.

56:59.149 --> 57:01.584
I'm not talking.

57:01.651 --> 57:03.119
I can't wait to see.

57:03.186 --> 57:05.587
That's the thing
about a really great book.

57:05.655 --> 57:08.352
You can't wait
to get through it,

57:08.425 --> 57:12.123
but once it's over,
it's actually kinda sad.

57:12.195 --> 57:14.858
Yeah, yeah.

57:14.931 --> 57:19.096
I always read the last pages
of a book really slowly.

57:19.169 --> 57:21.536
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

57:21.604 --> 57:25.439
So why did you name your cat
Sydney and not Charles?

57:25.508 --> 57:26.771
Read the book.

57:26.843 --> 57:30.143
Okay, okay, okay, deal.

57:30.213 --> 57:32.580
Books are your life?

57:34.451 --> 57:35.680
Yeah.

57:43.693 --> 57:46.822
Usually after this big day,
I give tomorrow off to relax

57:46.896 --> 57:49.889
because the next day is the
final big trip to Puerto Viejo,

57:49.966 --> 57:51.400
the Caribbean side.

57:51.468 --> 57:54.131
It's very different
and very beautiful.

57:54.204 --> 57:55.729
It's home of the Rastas.

57:55.805 --> 57:57.501
Yes! Short for Rastafaris.

57:57.574 --> 58:00.408
You're a very good teacher.
A very, very good teacher.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.173
I think you
just like learning.

58:02.245 --> 58:04.771
My daughter was amazed
I was reading a book.

58:04.848 --> 58:06.180
She thanks you.

58:06.249 --> 58:10.152
I hope you enjoyed the tour.
- I did.

58:10.220 --> 58:13.418
And for Friday, you should
bring your bathing suit.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.186
Have you ever been
in the Caribbean water?

58:15.258 --> 58:17.454
No.

58:17.527 --> 58:19.826
I'm not big on swimming.

58:19.896 --> 58:21.194
You don't have to swim.

58:21.264 --> 58:23.426
It's good just to be in it.

58:23.500 --> 58:26.197
It's such a pretty blue.

58:26.269 --> 58:29.205
But I'm not going to push.

58:29.272 --> 58:32.436
And it's a longer drive
to Puerto Viejo than Arenal,

58:32.509 --> 58:35.001
so we usually stay overnight.

58:35.078 --> 58:36.205
Is that okay?

58:36.279 --> 58:39.147
Yeah, okay.

58:40.850 --> 58:41.874
Be careful.

58:43.686 --> 58:44.984
Okay, Jane, have a good night.

58:45.054 --> 58:46.920
Okay.
- Pura vida.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:20.810
A simple bathing suit.

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:23.785
A place to buy a bathing suit.
- Yes.

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:26.584
Yes! There's a place
in Quepos.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:29.888
I'll write down the name and
address for the taxi driver.

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.325
Okay?
- Okay.

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:36.924
And my cousin has a salon
for hair and nails,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.334
you know,
if you want, okay?

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:42.668
You think so?
- Yes.

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:45.368
Could be nice.
- Okay.

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:49.004
What?

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.109
Nothing, nothing.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:54.912
No, no, no, no.
What, what, what?

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:58.182
Your guide Juan,
he's treating you well?

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.052
You like him?

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.789
Yes.
- Yes?

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.353
He's a good guide, I think.
- Okay.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.296
Why? What's the matter?

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.924
Nothing. I...

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.027
I just want to make sure
that he was treating you well.

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:17.369
Why? He doesn't
treat customers well?

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.375
No. No, it's...

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:23.038
It's not that.
I'm sorry. I was just asking.

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:25.672
Have fun, Jane.
I write down name.

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:14.256
I know it's clichéd
to be quoting Sylvia Plath,

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:19.030
but she did chart her demise
with dispassionate flair.

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:22.766
"Remember, remember,

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.432
this is now...

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:27.238
and now...

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.779
and now.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.439
Live it,

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:33.244
feel it,

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.444
cling to it.

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:40.388
I want to become acutely aware
of all I've taken for granted."

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:31.272
I know the feeling.
I cried at the end of Twilight.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.241
I wasn't crying, babe.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:36.279
It's okay.
Women like sensitive men.

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:38.405
Go to school, Anna.
Come on.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:41.246
I'm late.
I need you to drive me.

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.945
I have to pick up
my client.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:45.386
I know.
I'm gonna meet the librarian.

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.320
Anna!
- Papi!

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:50.860
"Cipher."

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.898
"Cipher."

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:11.047
You'll be okay, Papi.

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:22.984
# Feel my heart in you #

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:27.554
#And I feel your heart #

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.565
# I feel your heart in me #

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:41.475
Anna, sit in the front.
She sits in the back.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.206
Come on.
- Okay.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:48.379
And be calm, Anna.
Be calm.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:50.579
I'm calm.
You're the one who's not calm.

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.178
Anna.
- Pap...

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:53.883
Shh! Don't say it.

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:05.526
What are you talking about?
She's pretty.

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:17.412
Wow!

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.506
Thanks.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.608
I...

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:23.585
I thought you'd like
the T-shirt.

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:26.555
Yeah, and your hair
and everything.

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:29.615
You look beautiful.

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:31.558
Thanks.

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:35.394
I've never had
a Caribbean vacation before.

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:37.023
Well, you're ready for it.

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:39.898
Oh, I hope it is okay.
I have to drop my daughter off.

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.665
Yes?

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:48.043
Hello. I'm Anna.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.476
I'm Jane.

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:51.639
Jane the librarian.

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:54.946
Yes. I guess...
I guess so.

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:56.679
Oh. Sorry.

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.946
I go to the library every day.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:03.151
It's small, but I like it.

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:06.923
I know the libraries in America
are huge, but...

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.965
huge isn't always better.

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.659
Anna, please.

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:12.429
No, it's okay.

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:19.334
Do you like to read?

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.274
Yes, a lot.

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:24.576
Anything fun right now?

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:27.310
We're reading Charlotte's Web
by E.B. White.

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:31.150
I love Wilbur.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.655
Yeah. I love him too.

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:38.691
I look up American universities
on the computer at school.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.491
I'm going to be a doctor.

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.691
Do you think
I should be a librarian?

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:45.667
No. Doctor's great.

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:48.295
Yeah. I'm going to cure cancer.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.403
My mama had that.

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.348
I'm sorry.

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:01.145
It's okay.

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:25.399
Okay.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:31.014
Come on, let's go, Anna.

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:34.143
Well, you're really smart
and pretty.

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:35.377
Thank you.

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.750
I can Facebook you.
- Anna...

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.755
I'm not on the Facebook.

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:42.758
I thought everyone in America
was on Facebook.

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.384
Okay.
- You're probably right.

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:55.636
Bye.

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:57.697
See you later
- Have a nice trip.

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.442
Well, you survived
Hurricane Anna.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.412
She's beautiful.

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:06.604
Let's go.

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:11.780
# Can you hear the night #

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:14.619
# Whisper to the morning #

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.352
# She's talking
about the times #

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.830
# When the fire burned bright #

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:28.761
# She often wonders how #

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:31.569
# How the people forgot her #

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:37.278
# It must have been the rain #

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:39.837
# That washed them with doubt #

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:46.379
#And so here we go #

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:49.653
# Up off the ground #

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:53.093
# Spinning round #

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.130
Cheers.

01:08:54.196 --> 01:08:56.756
#Around and round #

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:03.094
# Here we go #

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:06.768
# Up off the ground #

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:10.108
# Spinning round #

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:14.082
#Around and round #

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:17.609
# Here we go #

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:21.520
# Up off the ground #

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.152
# Spinning round #

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:28.720
#Around and round #

01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:43.676
Eee-my!

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:45.715
You look...
- I look like a woman

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:48.841
who hasn't worn a bathing suit
in forever.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.684
I think it's too rough
to float.

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.384
Oh, I agree.

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:59.451
But maybe we could
just go for a walk.

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.895
Yes.

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:04.900
Listen,
I know I don't own you,

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.903
so if you wanna go
for the day, that's...

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.802
No, thank you.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:13.832
I was planning on watching you
have the best day of your life.

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:30.518
I finished the book,
by the way.

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:32.926
Wow. That was fast.

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:34.930
Yeah, I couldn't
stop reading it.

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:38.263
I was like addicted to it.
- Yeah.

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:40.530
I felt very bad
for Sydney Carton,

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:44.438
to love someone so much
when she does not love you

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:47.533
and still be willing
to give up your life for her,

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.705
so she can be happy
with another man and...

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:51.974
Oof. Crazy.

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:56.516
The last line of the book
was so powerful.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:59.248
I read it over and over.

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:02.257
I remember it.

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:03.792
Yes?
- Yeah.

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:06.658
Could you say it to me
in English.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.856
Come on.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:10.991
Okay.

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:18.770
"It's a far, far better thing
that I do than I've ever done.

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:22.869
And it's a far, far better rest
that I go to

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:25.642
than I've ever known."

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:29.207
He's happy to give his life
and go to death

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.947
because of the good
he has done.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.012
Beautiful. Whoa.

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:37.993
To Mr. Sydney Carton,
who lives in your cat.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.456
Okay.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.865
You know, I've lived
in Santa Monica...

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:23.667
it's in California,
Santa Monica...

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:26.436
for, I don't know, years,

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:30.878
and I hardly ever...
go to the beach.

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.539
I forget it's even there.

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.446
Yeah.

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:38.009
I love this place.
I love the feel of it.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:41.387
Yeah. This is different
from the Pacific side.

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:42.720
Right?
- Yeah.

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:44.885
It's different, yeah.
- Yes.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.054
I love the Pacific side.

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.893
You showed me
beautiful places.

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:50.990
Yeah.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.903
This is different.
I don't know. It's just...

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:59.635
I don't even know
the American word for it.

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.336
"Chill."

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.504
I think "chill" is the American
word you're looking for.

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.013
Yeah, you're right.
- Chill.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.844
That's it.
- Yeah.

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.543
Chill.

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:10.552
Look at this.

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:14.386
Yeah, it's from the reef.
It's right here.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.583
Yeah.

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.057
Chill.

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.329
Enjoy your life.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.528
To the best day of your life.

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:28.867
I'll drink to that.

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.371
Pura vida.

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:44.112
"Dear Juan,

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:48.681
I truly am sorry
to have done this to you,

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:52.717
to have done this to myself
while I'm with you.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.164
You really did show me
the best week of my life.

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:05.401
But unfortunately...

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:08.842
I'd already screwed up
the rest of it beforehand."

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:42.844
Do you wanna dance?

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:45.107
Come on!

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:55.453
You better, Jane.
Come on, walk with the music.

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.757
I don't want to.

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:06.165
I think it's just
too advanced for me.

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.601
Okay, okay.
- Are you...

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.433
No, no. Come with me.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.529
Okay.

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:18.240
Here.

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:25.247
You're okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.059
Are you sure?

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:37.657
Yeah. I want to...
I want to try.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.964
Okay.
- Life is short, right?

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:41.503
Yes, it is.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.970
Pura vida.

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.097
Wait.

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:55.914
Gracias.

01:15:58.153 --> 01:16:01.146
I got it.
- Okay.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.089
No, I have...
I have a lighter.

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:05.252
Let me see it.

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.296
I've never seen one before.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:09.628
Oh.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:16.967
Me first?

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.850
Stop. Esta bien.

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:39.258
Cough it out.
Cough it out.

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.298
No.
- What'd I do wrong?

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:45.129
No, no, no. It's...

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.294
You must do it slower,
you know?

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.312
Okay.
- Okay.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.351
Slower, you know?

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:08.924
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop. Out.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.755
Okay, okay.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.730
Slow.

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.269
Pura vida, my...

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:24.771
Oh, no, you have to...

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.570
Shh!
- Okay, okay.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.338
Okay! Shh!

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:31.244
Yeah, yeah, feel free.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:34.010
Don't, no, no, in, in.
Stop. Stop.

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:37.109
Good. Out, out, out.

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:41.281
As soon as you can.
Yes, take it out.

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:44.656
Okay, okay. No more.

01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:46.354
Okay.
- Not many...

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.676
Wow.

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:06.647
The moon is glowing.

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:11.050
Just glowing and glowing and
glowing and glowing and glowing.

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:14.351
It's really amazing.

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:16.289
It is.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:17.986
You feel okay?

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.189
Uh, funny.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:23.823
Yeah, I don't know.
Why? Do I sound weird?

01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:25.925
No. No, no, no.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.168
Your voice sounds like...

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:38.974
Good.
- Well, I can tell you,

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:42.211
I don't even feel like
a pathetic librarian anymore,

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:44.412
but...

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:47.456
I don't really feel
like myself either.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.281
That's good.

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:56.094
When were you ever pathetic?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.764
You're not pathetic.

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.702
Yes.

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.433
Yes, yes.

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:07.840
Yes, I was pathetic too.
- No, you're not.

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:10.435
Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
I'm gonna tell you.

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:12.447
I'm gonna tell you why now.

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:15.245
I am pathetic when I read
the dictionary

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:19.118
to find big words to use
to impress American women.

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:22.021
Yeah, to look smart.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:24.719
What, you're up
to the letter "C"?

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.955
Okay. Oh, oh!

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:30.260
Enough, enough, enough!
It's gonna ruin my day too!

01:19:30.332 --> 01:19:32.062
No. Just remember this.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.467
You're a good man, Juan,

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:38.473
and you're a really good
father to Anna.

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.375
So whatever you do,
just promise me this.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.470
Just promise me
that you'll remember

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:48.449
that I had the best,

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:52.784
best week of my entire life...

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:54.823
with you.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.291
Okay?

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.987
Promise?

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:17.510
Your lips are like
little pillows.

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:19.445
Okay, I'm sorry.
We don't...

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:20.948
No, I, uh...

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:23.815
I've not done this
in a long time.

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.444
Jane?

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:03.376
Jane.

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:04.976
Jane?

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.679
Jane!

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:46.426
Jane!

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:48.929
Are you...

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:51.159
sunbathing?

01:22:52.467 --> 01:22:54.663
Yeah.

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:57.672
Are you okay?

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:59.173
Yeah.

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:04.577
You're in your underwear, Juan.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.308
Yeah.

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:08.976
Well, yeah.

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:12.054
And you? You're okay?

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:18.484
Yeah?

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.724
Yeah. Yeah.

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:26.531
You wanna go swimming?

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:28.297
It's nice.

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.736
Yeah.

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.568
Yeah.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:36.040
Well...

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:39.604
you should put
your bathing suit on.

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:41.343
Yeah.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:44.652
Okay.

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.551
I'm gonna grab one.

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:50.285
Everything's okay?
- Everything's great.

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.327
Okay, okay.

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:55.724
Yeah, oh...

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:57.197
Juan.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.567
Pura vida.

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:04.162
Pura vida, Jane.

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.673
Pura vida.

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:26.726
I traveled here to do
a little living before I died.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:29.788
I guess I did a little
too much living.

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:53.280
Okay!

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:56.682
I have accessed
the creature.

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:01.725
You have choos-pah.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.263
Eee-my!

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.484
Anna...

01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:34.824
Papi!

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:37.593
Shh! Wait, wait.

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:41.336
Come on, go now.

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.716
Anna!
- Jane.
