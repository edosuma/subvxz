00:01.000 --> 00:07.040
This programme contains
some strong language.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.199
..Five, six, pick up sticks.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.199
Seven, eight, run to the gate.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.879
Nine, ten, a big fat hen!

00:19.520 --> 00:21.959
In you get. Come on, let's go.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.519
Who wants fish and chips?
- Me!

00:24.520 --> 00:27.519
OK, so it's fish and chips for four,

00:27.520 --> 00:30.999
and are you going to have
mushy peas or not? No. No.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.079
Eh? You've got to have mushy peas.
No...

00:35.080 --> 00:39.479
Fish and chips aren't fish and chips
without mushy peas.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.719
£1.60 chips, £2.80 fish.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.559
How much together?

00:44.560 --> 00:46.279
4.40? Correct.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.639
So, fish and chips for four,
Sophie, please?

00:49.640 --> 00:51.119
I don't know.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.679
Looking forward to eating them?

00:53.680 --> 00:57.639
Yes. Then I strongly advise you to
attempt an answer,

00:57.640 --> 01:01.120
since not to do so could result
in a crushing disappointment.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.840
£17.60. Thank you.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.279
Hiya, Mum.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.479
Oh, we'll be there in five minutes.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.799
Warm the plates. Why?

01:18.800 --> 01:20.559
We've got fish and chips.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.199
I told them no burgers and no chips.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.919
It was my idea.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.959
No, it wasn't. It was Sophie's idea,

01:26.960 --> 01:29.359
because she can twist you round
her bloody little finger.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.199
Aw, they've been good.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.639
Well, I don't care.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.279
They've had chips twice
this week already.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.399
They're going to start
looking like bloody chips.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.319
Put her on a sec. You've got me
into trouble. Sorry.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.119
Hi, Mum.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.999
What did I tell you?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.479
Grandma wanted them.
No, she didn't.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.919
Honest, Mum, she did.
We wanted pizza.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.880
I told her
you'd go mad. We wanted pizza, Mum!

02:04.600 --> 02:07.479
Grandma? Grandma!
Gran! Grandma!

02:07.480 --> 02:09.239
Sophie, what's wrong?

02:14.360 --> 02:17.399
Grandma! Come on, wake up.
We're going to crash.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.960
Hello? Sophie?

02:24.920 --> 02:26.720
Sophie?

02:35.960 --> 02:37.640
Sophie!

02:43.040 --> 02:44.840
Hello? Hello?

02:50.360 --> 02:52.359
Hello!

02:52.360 --> 02:55.440
Can anybody hear me? Please
pick the phone up. Hello?

03:00.080 --> 03:01.479
Mum!

03:01.480 --> 03:03.519
Excuse me. Sorry.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.159
Mum!

03:05.160 --> 03:06.679
Oh, God, Mum.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.399
Where's the kids?
Where are my kids?!

03:09.400 --> 03:11.879
Blue Volvo.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.639
Girls! Oh, my God!

03:13.640 --> 03:15.199
Mum!

03:15.200 --> 03:16.999
Come here.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.760
Oh...

03:23.040 --> 03:26.319
No, the kids are fine but they've
taken them in to check them over,

03:26.320 --> 03:27.839
so you need to pick them up, OK?

03:27.840 --> 03:30.559
Where are they taking them? The
children's, and they're starving,

03:30.560 --> 03:32.039
so you're going to need to feed them.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.879
They're taking me mam to the Royal,
so I'm just following them now.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.239
Can you phone our Claire and just
tell her what's happened, please?

03:38.240 --> 03:39.879
What?

03:39.880 --> 03:41.279
Can't you?

03:41.280 --> 03:44.559
Yeah, I could, but I'm driving,
you selfish bastard.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.919
I'm really stressing.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.559
Do you think I've lost weight?

03:54.560 --> 03:55.919
A bit, yeah.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.279
I wanted to lose a stone
but failed abysmally,

03:58.280 --> 04:00.999
so I'm making sure
I get fat bridesmaids. Oh, really?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.759
This is a message for Claire.
But my dad's being awkward.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.719
Sorry, do you mind if I get that?
Jenny's on the way to the hospital.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.199
I have to pick up the kids. Hello?
Yeah, it's me.

04:11.200 --> 04:16.319
Your mum, she's been in a car crash.
Is it bad? Yeah. Which hospital?

04:16.320 --> 04:20.358
The Royal. Jenny's gone with her.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.000
Thanks.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.360
I'm... I'm sorry, I've got to go.
My mum's crashed her car.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.719
Mum?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.200
Mum?

05:01.320 --> 05:03.359
Are you OK?

05:11.400 --> 05:12.880
No...

05:15.120 --> 05:18.119
Isn't there some rule, some limit
as to how long we can wait?

05:18.120 --> 05:19.439
Four hours? A target, sir.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.599
I'm well over that.
I know what's going on here.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.959
I'm over the limit, I'm already
a blot on your statistics,

05:23.960 --> 05:26.359
so you might as well keep me
waiting... Excuse me.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.519
It will have no effect on your
numbers... Nothing of the sort, sir.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.679
I promise you... Excuse me...
No, excuse me, please, love!

05:32.680 --> 05:35.279
Now, what's going on? If you just
take a seat,

05:35.280 --> 05:38.999
we'll be with you as soon as we can.
Take a seat. Always, take a seat.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.839
Sorry about that. It's OK.
I'm looking for Mary Taylor.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.799
She's my mum.
She had a car crash.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.680
She was brought in earlier.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.920
Hiya, Mum.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.879
Mum?

06:07.880 --> 06:09.520
George?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.880
It's Claire, Mum.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.359
She doesn't know me either.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.959
What's she doing here?

06:18.960 --> 06:23.039
We're just waiting for a scan,
but there's loads in front of us.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.559
George?

06:24.560 --> 06:26.240
Dad's dead, Mum.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.600
I wanted flowers to wake
up the candle drums.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.839
Well, we can get you some flowers, Mum.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.639
How long have you been here?
Two hours.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.679
I wanted flowers to wake
up the candle drums.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.079
Oh, for God's sake!

06:50.080 --> 06:52.399
No, Claire, don't piss them off.

06:52.400 --> 06:58.360
I wanted flowers to wake
up the candle drums.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.800
Come on, it's all right.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.080
Oh, shit.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.479
Hiya, mate.
I'm so sorry, but I've got no money.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.799
My kids were in a crash.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.479
I was on the phone to them
when it happened and I just ran out

08:08.480 --> 08:10.279
the house with nothing.
I'm so sorry.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.959
Then you can't get out, love.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.040
Well, what am I supposed to do?

08:38.240 --> 08:40.360
I won't be long.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.760
Do you want to come in? No.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.639
Kids, your mum's here!

08:57.640 --> 08:59.439
What did you give them?

08:59.440 --> 09:01.239
Cheesy chips. Jesus.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.519
What? Nothing.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.159
How is she?

09:05.160 --> 09:06.959
Not good.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.439
If there's anything I can...

09:09.440 --> 09:10.960
Money-wise?

09:12.720 --> 09:16.079
Look, I came out without my keys.
The house.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.960
Oh, well, I'll get mine.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.719
Kids.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.760
Bye, Cheryl. Bye, Cheryl.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.719
Mum!

09:27.720 --> 09:29.799
Hi. Hi, darling.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.279
Mum!

09:31.280 --> 09:33.479
Bye, Dad. All right, girls. Come on.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.079
Go wait in the taxi.
I'll race you.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.479
Thanks. I'll post them back through
your letterbox.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.160
Right.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.400
Just here on the left.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.440
Yeah, just here.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.079
Come on, girls. Out you get.
Cheers, mate.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.599
I won't be a sec, all right?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.440
Thank you. Go on.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.759
Come on, girls. Straight up to bed,
please.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.600
Night-night. Night-night.
Love you. Love you too.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.640
Shit.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.279
Agh!

10:25.680 --> 10:28.640
Take 18, please. Thank you.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.879
Hi, Pete.
It's Jenny Northwood here.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.759
Look, you're probably manning my till,

10:52.760 --> 10:55.119
but I won't be in for a while,
I'm afraid.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.999
My mum's sick, and there's
no-one to sort the kids out.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.039
All right, girls?

11:00.040 --> 11:02.199
Bye, Mummy. Mwah. Bye, Mummy.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.840
Have a good day, all right?
Love you!

11:57.400 --> 11:59.560
She's sitting up.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.759
She's sitting up!

12:02.760 --> 12:04.279
Mary?

12:04.280 --> 12:05.599
Yeah.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.040
She insisted.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.920
Hi, Mum.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.840
Hi, it's me.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.639
It's Jenny.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.120
Hotchpotch.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.600
Hotchpotch.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.719
Excuse me, sorry... Yes?

12:29.720 --> 12:32.440
I don't know what she's trying to say.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.159
Hotchpotch!

12:35.160 --> 12:37.079
It's the toilet, isn't it, Mary?

12:37.080 --> 12:39.840
Could you just wait at the entrance
while we...? Claire?

13:49.360 --> 13:52.919
Hi. You're not answering
your phone. It's flat.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.839
Your landline.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.320
There's a fault on the landline,
I think.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.639
What is it you wanted?

14:01.640 --> 14:04.039
I did want you to pick
the girls from school,

14:04.040 --> 14:06.239
but I can get them now. Right.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.359
Not tomorrow, though.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.999
I can't.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.199
You can't pick them
up in the afternoon? No.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.679
Well, then, take them in the morning?

14:15.680 --> 14:17.319
I can't do that either.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.279
You've got to start pulling your weight,

14:19.280 --> 14:23.559
Dave, otherwise I'm going to lose
my job. I can't, I'm sorry.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.200
For God's sake.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.359
She's going to start work soon.
Cheryl?

14:29.360 --> 14:32.959
Yeah, you know, and when she does
then I'll be able to help out

14:32.960 --> 14:34.799
a lot more.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.320
More regular too.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.000
What?

14:43.400 --> 14:44.760
What?

14:57.880 --> 14:59.759
George? Mam, Dad's dead.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.599
So, up to this stroke,
she was living independently?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.199
Yes. He died years ago.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.319
Her dementia was manageable?

15:06.320 --> 15:07.759
She doesn't have dementia.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.999
How much do these things cost?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.359
You mean it wasn't diagnosed?

15:11.360 --> 15:13.839
No, I mean there was absolutely
nothing wrong with her.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.519
She's been minding my kids,

15:15.520 --> 15:19.239
and I wouldn't let a demented
woman to that. George... George...

15:19.240 --> 15:20.999
It's not Dad, Mam.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.159
Sorry. Sorry, my mum's
a bit confused.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.759
Don't worry about it.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.199
Why a bottle full of ice?

15:27.200 --> 15:28.839
Mam, Mam, sit down.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.479
George! Sit down, Mam.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.079
No...

15:33.080 --> 15:35.199
What type of house is it?

15:35.200 --> 15:37.399
A terraced. Does she own it?

15:37.400 --> 15:39.919
No. Is that a problem?

15:39.920 --> 15:41.079
No.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.079
Steps might be. Are there any?

15:43.080 --> 15:45.199
Two? Three.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.999
You bought me that.
So we could be looking at a ramp.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.479
You're thinking of sending her home?

15:50.480 --> 15:52.559
Well, she's been here
three weeks already.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.679
It's difficult to see
what else we can do for her.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.719
Can I just stop you there?

15:56.720 --> 15:59.239
Right? My mum has had a stroke.

15:59.240 --> 16:03.199
Yes. And she's making no sense.
She's convinced anything that moves

16:03.200 --> 16:06.479
is her dead husband and right now,
she's trying to eat metal.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.639
Mam, no, no, no. So there's
obviously brain-damage, yes?

16:09.640 --> 16:11.799
Yes. So shouldn't we be
trying to fix that?

16:11.800 --> 16:13.879
Yes, but this is
an assessment ward, Claire.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.799
We are not staffed for rehabilitation.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.679
Then can we go somewhere that is?
There are no places available.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.919
And even if there were,
they are designed to get people

16:20.920 --> 16:23.439
back on their feet, and Mary
is already walking.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.679
Yeah, but she's no idea
where she's walking to. I know.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.719
Look, I think we'll talk again
after the kitchen test.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.399
What's the kitchen test?

16:31.400 --> 16:34.559
Occupational Therapy need to know
that Mary can find her way

16:34.560 --> 16:37.239
around the kitchen and make
herself a cup of tea.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.759
Are you serious?

16:38.760 --> 16:40.000
Yes.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.680
You can sit in if you like?
Oh, I'd love to.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.960
What am I doing, Mary, hmm?

16:56.680 --> 16:58.840
I'm filling the kettle, aren't I?

17:00.760 --> 17:02.480
Would you like to do it?

17:05.680 --> 17:09.160
If you show me you can do it,
you can go home.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.839
Would you like that?

17:18.880 --> 17:20.400
Never mind, eh?

17:26.240 --> 17:27.560
So...

17:29.320 --> 17:30.920
...what do we do next?

17:33.920 --> 17:37.759
Come on, Mam, what do you do next?
We do ask families not to prompt.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.999
Sorry. Or intervene in any way
during these tests.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.879
You see, our aim is to prove to Mary
that she can carry out these tasks

17:44.880 --> 17:47.159
without any help whatsoever.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.200
Right.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.999
Right, now there's water in the kettle.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.640
Mary?

17:54.880 --> 17:59.760
We plug it in here
and we turn it on... just here.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.040
Now, can you do that for me, Mary?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.160
Shall I show you?

18:23.440 --> 18:25.479
OK.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.000
Now your turn.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.760
Well, never mind, eh?
I'll tell you what.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.759
How about I make one first

18:44.760 --> 18:46.600
and then you can have a go?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.040
So...

18:50.280 --> 18:52.039
...what do we need?

18:52.040 --> 18:57.480
Well, we need a tea bag and a cup.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.359
Look over here, Mary.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.160
There's a lovely one.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.439
Roses.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.160
Now, I bet you love growing roses,
don't you?

19:10.080 --> 19:13.879
Now, here's a cup,
and here's the tea bag.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.519
Can you help me, Mary?

19:16.520 --> 19:18.919
Can you put the tea bag

19:18.920 --> 19:21.040
into the cup?

19:51.840 --> 19:53.559
No, no... No, Mam. Mam, Mam.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.079
Mary... No, spit it out. Spit it
out, please.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.519
Spit it out, Mam. No, no, no.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.679
It's OK. It's OK.
You tried your best.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.600
It's OK, Mary.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.279
Home.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.959
We're going to another hospital,
Mam, where you can get better.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.359
Home.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.000
Soon. Soon.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.399
You must be Mary.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.880
I'm Josh, Mary.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.799
Jenny. Hi.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.519
We'll soon have her dancing again.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.840
Won't we, Mary, hey?

21:03.640 --> 21:06.480
Just say what is, Mam.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.599
Tell me what it is!

21:17.920 --> 21:20.400
It's all right. It's all right.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.959
There is one thing.
Yeah.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.519
They've stopped saving
for their holiday.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.879
Yeah, they won't be able to go.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.079
That's a shame. Yeah.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.800
May I... May I ask why?

21:40.800 --> 21:45.280
Erm, well, I've lost my job
and tax credit.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.439
We'll refund what you have paid.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.680
I thought that wasn't possible?
It is in this case.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.160
Thank you.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.080
Stop!

22:03.280 --> 22:05.199
Stop laughing, I had it first.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.719
Give it back. Give it back.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.639
I had it first.

22:09.640 --> 22:10.959
No!

22:10.960 --> 22:12.200
Stop...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.839
What's happened?

22:20.840 --> 22:23.919
Sorry, I've tried
but she's taken against me.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.159
Sausage. You're not my friend
today, are you, Mary?

22:27.160 --> 22:28.599
Sausage!

22:28.600 --> 22:30.919
Do you want to wait outside?

22:30.920 --> 22:33.240
It's all right, it's OK.

22:34.360 --> 22:35.760
Just wait there.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.599
On the cake again?

22:41.600 --> 22:42.880
Yeah.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.839
She's been having more stomach
problems, and I'm wondering,

22:46.840 --> 22:48.879
should I go and ask
the doctor to see her again?

22:48.880 --> 22:50.920
You be all right? Yeah. Yeah.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.400
Hey, Mam.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.399
Why don't you have a little seat, hey?

23:01.400 --> 23:03.640
Hmm? Have a little sit down, hey?

23:05.280 --> 23:06.999
There you go.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.560
Careful.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.320
Have you got a pain, Mam?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.520
Yeah? Where?

23:22.400 --> 23:24.160
Where is it, Mam?

23:35.480 --> 23:37.839
There you go, let's have this, look.

23:37.840 --> 23:41.319
When the medicine kicks in,
I'll bring the girls in.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.400
That'll be nice, won't it?

23:54.240 --> 23:55.759
Come in.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.920
It's OK. Grandma's Grandma
again now.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.600
Promise.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.000
Good girls, come on.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.880
Give grandma a hug.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.479
Give her your letters.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.159
Good girls.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.120
Letters for Grandma.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.520
It's all right.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.480
I folded my garden gates.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.400
I folded my garden gates.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.239
It's OK.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.799
Good girls.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.680
I folded my garden gates.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.840
Oh.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.880
Hiya. Hi.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.719
I'm Amanda Jennings,

25:10.720 --> 25:13.439
and this is Diane, Mary's social worker,

25:13.440 --> 25:15.759
who will also be helping
you with the discharge.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.839
Now, do you have power of attorney?

25:17.840 --> 25:19.959
No, Mum's not fit to give it to us,

25:19.960 --> 25:22.599
so we're going for Court of Protection.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.719
Right. Diane, if you could go
and get the team,

25:25.720 --> 25:27.879
and bring Mrs Taylor in, please.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.479
You're bringing Mum in?

25:29.480 --> 25:30.599
Yes.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.519
Won't she get upset?

25:32.520 --> 25:35.159
It's the patient's right to attend
and play an active part

25:35.160 --> 25:37.040
in the discharge procedure.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.639
Diane and I will answer any
questions that you may have

26:03.640 --> 26:05.399
at the end of the meeting.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.639
So, Dr O'Sullivan,
if you can bring us up to date

26:07.640 --> 26:09.759
and then we can let you go.

26:09.760 --> 26:14.839
Mary Taylor had an acute stroke
which has affected her vision,

26:14.840 --> 26:17.519
right upper limb and cognitive ability.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.559
She was referred here for
rehabilitation. Don't shine for it.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.239
Don't shine for it.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.559
Since arriving, she's developed
additional medical problems...

26:25.560 --> 26:28.959
Don't shine for it! ..Nausea,
vomiting and acute constipation.

26:28.960 --> 26:32.559
She has been referred to
a consultant gastroenterologist.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.559
She has been given antibiotics

26:34.560 --> 26:36.959
and steroids while she waits to see him.

26:36.960 --> 26:40.039
Once seen, she'll be followed up
after discharge as an outpatient.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.359
There's nowhere.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.759
Thank you, Doctor.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.119
Could I ask why she's on a drip?

26:45.120 --> 26:47.839
Because he's dehydrated, owing
to her difficulty swallowing.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.679
Nowhere on my face...

26:49.680 --> 26:51.439
Doctor's very busy today,

26:51.440 --> 26:54.119
so can we move on to you, Hilary,
and physiotherapy?

26:54.120 --> 26:55.960
Yeah, thank you, Doctor.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.359
When Mary arrived, we focused on
treatment to make the muscles aware,

27:00.360 --> 27:04.799
however since the health problems
we've been unable to carry on.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.799
This morning, we tested Mary.
You climb into my water,

27:07.800 --> 27:11.199
so get me out of there. When given
objects, she couldn't match them.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.879
A sock with a sock, a picture card
with a word card.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.759
You climb into my water,
so get me out of there.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.239
I don't understand what
you are saying, Mam.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.919
We still see involving Mary as an
active goal. Plunder. Plunder.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.599
So far there's been no progress.
Fetch me a bone.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.759
We think this is more cognitive
than physical,

27:27.760 --> 27:30.599
and there's not much more we can do
on that front.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.559
I have a note from Speech Therapy
saying they've have to discontinue

27:33.560 --> 27:36.159
due to lack of cooperation.
I just...

27:36.160 --> 27:40.759
I know how hard this is for everyone
but we are nearly there.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.999
Nurse Brown.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.079
Mary is often very confused...

27:45.080 --> 27:47.199
She is uncooperative,

27:47.200 --> 27:50.519
at times aggressive.

27:50.520 --> 27:53.559
She only sleeps for short periods

27:53.560 --> 27:57.839
and is often found wandering,
disturbing other patients.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.199
Due to falls,
her mattress is now on the floor.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.759
She has assaulted three nurses
and a cleaner.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.359
We are trying...

28:08.960 --> 28:11.399
I've had enough of this.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.279
I understand this is upsetting
everyone. No, it's ridiculous.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.239
I promise you, carry on,

28:17.240 --> 28:19.919
it'll all be over in a
matter of minutes.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.399
I've seen enough.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.760
Come on, we're going home, Mam.
We're going home.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.519
Just listen to her, right?
I've got to go and get the kids.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.999
Five minutes.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.599
I'm not here to talk
you into anything, Jenny.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.599
You've removed your mother from
the hospital, and that suits us all.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.399
We can all wash our hands of her,

29:16.400 --> 29:19.039
but there's things you should know, OK?

29:19.040 --> 29:21.159
You've got to childproof your kitchen,

29:21.160 --> 29:23.359
otherwise she is guaranteed to scald
herself

29:23.360 --> 29:26.199
and very, very likely to burn
the house down.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.679
You need a secure gate
at the top up the stairs

29:28.680 --> 29:30.719
or you're going to find her
in a heap at the bottom.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.359
You need handrails on
the bath and toilet,

29:33.360 --> 29:36.319
or she's going to crack
her head open on the tiles.

29:36.320 --> 29:39.440
And a dozen other things I could
mention, but that will do for now.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.919
I haven't got any money.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.839
We'll pay. It's cheaper
than keeping her in hospital.

29:46.840 --> 29:50.239
But you can't look after a demented
mother and two kids

29:50.240 --> 29:53.519
while there's building work
going on around you.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.439
So, what do I do?

29:55.440 --> 29:57.119
Put her into care.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.479
No. Just while the builders
are in, that's all.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.439
No! Look, I know you think
I've got a cheek,

30:03.440 --> 30:05.160
but she's my mother too.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.600
Hello.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.559
Hello. You must be Mary.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.960
Mary, I'm Helen.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.519
Hi, I'm Jenny. Hi.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.479
Welcome to Belle Vista, Mary.

31:11.480 --> 31:14.559
I'm the one you come to if you've
any problems.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.760
And I'm the one who's going to be
showing you round today, OK?

31:25.160 --> 31:26.839
This is the lounge.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.999
You'll probably spend most
of your time here, Mary,

31:29.000 --> 31:30.559
most people do.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.159
There's a concert once a week
if you're well enough.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.919
Visitors are welcome.

31:34.920 --> 31:38.280
Give me five minutes,
love, I won't be long.

31:39.400 --> 31:43.640
And last but not least, your bedroom.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.480
Thank you.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.640
I'll leave you to it.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.600
It's just for a bit, Mam.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.160
It's just while I get
the house ready for you.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.640
Hi. Hiya.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.279
How did it go?

33:23.280 --> 33:24.640
Um...

33:47.880 --> 33:49.240
Jenny?

34:27.880 --> 34:32.319
On the pack ice,
the polar bears are hunting seals.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.440
Their activity attracts attention.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.759
When a meal is found,

34:43.760 --> 34:45.518
it's all fours to the pump

34:45.520 --> 34:48.719
as the mother encourages
her cubs to feast.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.199
Once down to the bone,
she frantically digs

34:53.199 --> 34:55.319
around in the snow for scraps...

35:20.160 --> 35:22.759
Hello.
Hi, is that Jenny Northwood?

35:22.760 --> 35:24.119
Yes, speaking.

35:24.120 --> 35:26.359
This is the nursing home.
Your mother's gone missing.

35:26.360 --> 35:30.679
Missing? Yeah. You mean
she's somewhere in the building?

35:30.680 --> 35:33.599
Not exactly. She's nowhere in the
building.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.759
Oh, God. I'll come in. No, it would
be better if you stay...

35:36.760 --> 35:38.280
No, I'm coming!

35:43.320 --> 35:47.079
Hiya. Dave? Dave, it's me.
Look, my mum has gone missing

35:47.080 --> 35:48.680
in that bloody nursing home.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.279
I don't know, but I just need
you to come over here, OK. Why?

35:58.280 --> 36:01.079
Because I'm going to go over there,
that's why!

36:01.080 --> 36:03.639
Hello? Hello?

36:03.640 --> 36:05.440
Shit, I've been drinking.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.479
Jenny, isn't it? Yeah.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.919
The best thing you can do, Jenny,
is wait at home by the phone.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.399
My husband's doing that,
I want to see her room, please.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.279
We've searched her room,
she's not there.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.959
I want to know what she's wearing.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.600
All right. Yeah...

36:44.240 --> 36:45.919
Come on.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.280
Her coat's here. Yeah.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.039
Her dressing gown isn't.

37:03.040 --> 37:07.280
My mother is walking around the city
in a dressing gown and nightie!

37:21.880 --> 37:23.200
Mam!

37:24.360 --> 37:26.159
Mam!

37:26.160 --> 37:27.640
Mam?

37:55.720 --> 37:57.759
Cheers. Cheers.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.759
Claire, look it's me.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.199
I'm at Mam's, she's gone missing,
and there's no sign of her here.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.760
Can you phone me when you get this?

38:45.320 --> 38:48.120
Not find her?
Police are still looking.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.080
The place is a dump.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.079
I mean that place, Belle Vista.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.279
Look, do you want a cup of tea?

39:02.280 --> 39:05.120
No, I'll do it.
No, no, no. I'll do it.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.640
Sophie...

39:27.000 --> 39:29.759
Sophie said she saw you and Cheryl?

39:29.760 --> 39:31.239
Yeah.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.199
In St Margaret's Street.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.200
She said she saw you coming
out of Mother And Child.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.320
Yeah.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.680
Is she pregnant?

39:47.920 --> 39:49.240
Yeah.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.720
When's it due?

39:56.760 --> 39:58.520
Four months gone.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.080
Do you know what it is?

40:11.400 --> 40:12.520
Yeah.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.560
Boy.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.440
You...

40:36.440 --> 40:38.919
I thought she was getting a job?

40:38.920 --> 40:41.919
As soon as you got a job, you were
going to be able to cough up

40:41.920 --> 40:46.159
some money to pay for the kids that
you left me with, yeah? Yeah.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.919
Well, that's not going to happen
now, is it, if she's pregnant? No.

40:55.960 --> 40:59.519
Hello. Hiya. Sorry, I only just
got your message.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.159
Have you found her? No.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.599
The police are looking.
Have you heard from her?

41:04.600 --> 41:06.879
The police are out searching.
Right, I'm coming up.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.879
Don't come up, Claire. Why not?
I should be there.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.079
I'll phone you if I hear anything,

41:12.080 --> 41:14.919
in case they're trying to phone me.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.200
Bye.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.999
Look, I'm going to be looking
after Mam from now on,

41:28.000 --> 41:29.479
so I'll get a Carer's Allowance

41:29.480 --> 41:31.719
but you need to find some
money from somewhere.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.239
I don't see why my kids should
suffer just because she's gone

41:34.240 --> 41:36.360
and got herself...
I will, I will. When? As soon as.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.960
No, no, no. The police.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.399
How did you know to bring her here?

41:55.400 --> 41:57.720
Two letters from two grandkids.

42:03.120 --> 42:07.320
Come in. Goodnight now,
Mary. Goodnight.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.719
It was recharging on the worktop.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.639
I haven't moved it, and Sophie hasn't

42:24.640 --> 42:27.559
because she's been searching high
and low for it, so that leaves you.

42:27.560 --> 42:30.319
Where is it? I don't know.
You're lying. I'm not.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.279
Have you brushed your teeth
this morning?

42:32.280 --> 42:34.160
Yeah. Breathe.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.399
Right, get up those stairs now
and clean your teeth. Ooh!

42:38.400 --> 42:40.479
You are a ten-year-old girl,
for God's sake.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.119
I shouldn't need to tell you when
you have to brush your teeth.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.479
Come on, we are late.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.239
Hurry up, come on.

42:46.240 --> 42:47.799
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.679
I feel ashamed.
You should, come on, just do it.

42:50.680 --> 42:54.839
Well, wet the toothbrush first.
Yeah! Sophie? Sophie? What?

42:54.840 --> 42:56.479
Just keep an eye on Grandma

42:56.480 --> 42:59.079
and tell me if she gets off that
chair, all right? Yeah.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.839
You don't put toothpaste on a dry
brush, for God's sake.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.640
What good will that do?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.280
Won't be a minute, Mam.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.960
Love you. Love you too. Bye, Mummy.
Bye.

43:51.240 --> 43:53.399
Mam, sorry, sorry, sorry.

43:53.400 --> 43:56.760
It's OK. Sorry.
I won't do that again, I promise.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.479
Come on, come on.

44:24.040 --> 44:25.759
Mam, come on.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.399
Can I help?

44:27.400 --> 44:29.439
No! Thanks.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.600
Come on.

44:31.720 --> 44:33.559
Come on, please.

44:33.560 --> 44:35.440
That's it. You're all right.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.440
Can I talk to you?

44:47.400 --> 44:48.880
Please?

44:56.080 --> 44:58.000
Careful, Mam.

45:06.880 --> 45:08.399
Do you want a tea?

45:08.400 --> 45:09.759
Yes, please.

45:09.760 --> 45:11.679
How do you take it?

45:11.680 --> 45:13.399
White, no sugar.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.959
They said you wouldn't be long,
so I waited.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.400
Chocolate, Mam?

45:19.720 --> 45:22.480
Keeps you out of mischief,
doesn't it, chocolate?

45:25.320 --> 45:26.599
Excuse me.

45:26.600 --> 45:29.719
Nick, I'm making tea if you want one.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.320
Yes, please.

45:33.920 --> 45:37.519
I never should have started that,
but I did, and now I'm making tea

45:37.520 --> 45:40.159
even if I don't want one,
just in case he does.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.360
Bit of a pushover like that, I guess.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.519
How did she get out?

45:50.520 --> 45:52.280
I don't know.

45:53.320 --> 45:56.679
There was a woman standing
in a pool of her own urine.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.599
Yes.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.640
How long had she been like that?

46:02.680 --> 46:04.400
I don't know that either.

46:11.520 --> 46:16.800
She was in a pool of urine because
we'd run out of incontinence pads.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.679
We always do.

46:19.680 --> 46:22.799
We get the cheaper ones,
the less absorbent ones,

46:22.800 --> 46:26.200
but even them we can barely afford.

46:28.680 --> 46:31.519
There were three of us on last night.

46:31.520 --> 46:35.999
30 residents, some with severe dementia,

46:36.000 --> 46:37.880
and just three staff.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.799
I've known just one of those
residents need the three of us

46:41.800 --> 46:45.519
to sort her out, which meant 29
people wandering around,

46:45.520 --> 46:47.119
unsupervised.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.720
Nevertheless, just the three of us.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.359
Can't blame the boss either, the owner.

46:56.360 --> 46:59.080
Our place makes him 20 grand a year.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.039
Put an extra member of staff on

47:02.040 --> 47:04.839
and that 20 grand has gone and the
place closes down.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.320
Everyone knows this...

47:07.760 --> 47:11.239
...local authority, the NHS, CQC.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.999
They know the standard
of care in places like ours

47:14.000 --> 47:15.560
isn't good enough.

47:16.960 --> 47:20.199
But better substandard care
than no care at all.

47:20.200 --> 47:22.319
So everybody keeps shtum.

47:22.320 --> 47:25.839
Meanwhile, people like us -
me, Rachel, Roz,

47:25.840 --> 47:30.400
the three who were on last night -
totally dedicated.

47:31.960 --> 47:35.000
As caring and compassionate
as anyone could be.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.440
We battle on.

48:09.360 --> 48:11.919
Look at the beautiful
bracelet, isn't it?

48:11.920 --> 48:14.759
I've not got a chair.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.399
Look, if you get lost again,

48:16.400 --> 48:19.079
they'll see the address on here
and they'll bring you back home.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.039
I've not got a chair.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.479
Mam, I worry about you, but if
you have this on

48:23.480 --> 48:25.719
I will worry a little bit less.
I've not got a chair.

48:25.720 --> 48:28.839
I don't know what you are saying,
Mam. Hiya. Hi.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.319
Hiya.

48:30.320 --> 48:31.999
Erm, I've finished.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.479
Right.

48:33.480 --> 48:36.000
Thanks for all the tea.
You're welcome.

48:37.680 --> 48:40.599
Erm, if anything goes wrong, at all,

48:40.600 --> 48:42.799
my number is on there.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.160
Great.

48:47.480 --> 48:49.359
Thanks.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.960
I was wondering...

48:54.320 --> 48:57.280
...if you fancied going for a drink
some time?

49:04.360 --> 49:06.400
I... I couldn't.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.640
Why not?

49:12.880 --> 49:14.360
My mam.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.119
Couldn't your sister...?

49:19.120 --> 49:20.960
No, she couldn't cope.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.160
You have to.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.359
Yeah, well, our Claire couldn't,
I'm sorry.

49:30.360 --> 49:33.920
I'm made up to be asked, but no.
I really couldn't.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.320
OK.

49:38.840 --> 49:40.320
Bye.

49:42.840 --> 49:44.280
Bye, Mary.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.560
Oh, shit.

50:38.640 --> 50:42.039
Lauren, are you sure you haven't had
them? No. Sophie? No.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.319
Mam, are you sure you've not seen
the keys?

50:44.320 --> 50:46.079
Look, they're not where they usually are

50:46.080 --> 50:48.039
and the kids haven't had them
and neither have I,

50:48.040 --> 50:49.999
so you must have them.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.759
I need to check your pockets.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.119
Can I just have a look
in your pocket, please?

50:54.120 --> 50:56.119
Mum, we're late, I need...

50:56.120 --> 50:58.319
For God's sake, Mam.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.719
You mustn't touch these
ever again, all right?

51:00.720 --> 51:02.720
Come on, kids. We're late.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.720
Got your bags?

51:12.400 --> 51:14.400
Quick, quick, quick.
Got your bags?

51:17.320 --> 51:18.680
Good girl.

51:20.480 --> 51:24.360
Bye, Mum.
Bye, darling. Love you.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.640
Oh, God.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.919
Mum, no.

51:31.920 --> 51:34.879
Mum, come on. Come on!
Get back in the car, please.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.039
No, no. Come on.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.760
No, no. Ow!

51:42.400 --> 51:45.919
It's OK, it's OK. Sh, it's OK,
it's OK.

51:45.920 --> 51:47.880
It's OK. Get back in the car.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.280
There we go.

51:56.480 --> 51:58.200
It's OK, it's OK.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.520
Mum.

52:37.920 --> 52:41.760
OK, stay in there. Fine by me.
I promise you.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.200
Careful.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.239
Don't touch these again, Mam, OK?

53:21.240 --> 53:22.480
Please.

53:25.120 --> 53:27.160
Do you want a cup of tea?

54:09.520 --> 54:10.999
Thank you.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.719
Hiya, kids.

54:12.720 --> 54:14.759
Hi! Hi, Mam.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.839
Claire is going to look
after you for a while,

54:16.840 --> 54:18.120
while we go out, OK?

54:20.080 --> 54:23.280
It's just for a bit, OK?

54:26.480 --> 54:30.119
Kids, come on, let's go.
Are you taking the girls? Yeah.

54:30.120 --> 54:32.160
Where? Dave's. Come on.

54:33.760 --> 54:36.240
Bye, Grandma! Bye, Grandma!

54:40.760 --> 54:42.200
In you get.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.920
Anything in to drink? No.

55:17.640 --> 55:20.839
Watch the road, please.

55:20.840 --> 55:22.880
Careful.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.600
Be good, OK?

55:36.120 --> 55:38.159
Hey, hello. Hi, Dad.

55:38.160 --> 55:41.160
Bye, Mum, love you.
Bye, love you too.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.239
What's with the bags?
They've got school tomorrow.

55:45.240 --> 55:47.399
What? They are sleeping over? Yeah.

55:47.400 --> 55:50.119
You didn't say that.
Yeah, I did. No, you didn't.

55:50.120 --> 55:52.399
You said you were going
for a drink with a mate.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.599
Well, I am.
And I'll be late.

55:54.600 --> 55:57.079
I'm not going to be dragging them
home at all hours of the night

55:57.080 --> 55:59.840
when they've got school in the morning.

56:01.040 --> 56:02.360
You look good.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.280
Thank you.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.599
It's a male friend, I take it?

56:09.600 --> 56:12.039
Yeah, Dave, it is.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.360
And you know what?

56:14.560 --> 56:17.560
He's going to fuck my brains out
all night.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.520
There we are. One wine and soda. Ta.

56:28.040 --> 56:29.840
Slainte.

56:37.120 --> 56:39.120
So have you got any
brothers and sisters?

56:40.640 --> 56:42.519
Aye, six.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.239
Six?

56:44.240 --> 56:47.519
It was the quick and the thin in our
house, I'm telling you.

56:47.520 --> 56:50.319
My mum, right, used to do a Sunday tea,

56:50.320 --> 56:55.319
you know, butties and sausage rolls
and cakes and all that stuff.

56:55.320 --> 56:57.639
And my brother, Tam,
he'd go like this...

56:57.640 --> 57:00.519
He would pick up a load
of stuff in his right hand

57:00.520 --> 57:02.879
and then he'd stash it
under the table in his left hand.

57:02.880 --> 57:05.039
And he would keep eating
with the right hand.

57:05.040 --> 57:07.599
And when everything was gone
and the table was empty,

57:07.600 --> 57:09.959
he would just resort
to what was in his left hand.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.319
Greedy bastard.

57:11.320 --> 57:12.519
Twice the size of me.

57:12.520 --> 57:13.600
Still is.

57:22.120 --> 57:24.599
What about you?

57:24.600 --> 57:26.240
It's just me and our Claire.

57:27.480 --> 57:29.040
And she's got no kids.

57:34.080 --> 57:36.000
Is that out of choice?

57:37.880 --> 57:40.359
Um, I don't know.

57:40.360 --> 57:43.080
I don't know, we don't really go there.

57:50.320 --> 57:54.999
I knew there was something wrong.
I didn't know he was carrying on,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.959
but I knew something wasn't right.

57:57.960 --> 58:01.079
So I said, "Why don't
we try for a boy?"

58:01.080 --> 58:03.239
Thinking that would sort it.

58:03.240 --> 58:06.879
But that's what he'd always wanted,
you see, deep down.

58:06.880 --> 58:10.079
Anyway, he just said, "No, I'm
happy with just the girls

58:10.080 --> 58:12.279
"and nothing was wrong."

58:12.280 --> 58:14.000
But now she's pregnant.

58:15.320 --> 58:19.440
This other woman is pregnant,
and, of course, it's a boy.

58:22.320 --> 58:25.240
So, yeah, that hurts a bit.

58:33.440 --> 58:34.880
Anyway...

58:39.960 --> 58:42.679
Why, thank you.

58:42.680 --> 58:45.119
Goodnight. Evening.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.879
Madison Street first, please, mate.

58:46.880 --> 58:48.239
Off Chambers, yeah.

58:48.240 --> 58:50.840
And then I'm going on
to Wardsworth Street, thanks.

58:52.640 --> 58:54.280
In your own time, mate.

58:55.440 --> 58:57.960
Do you want to come back for a coffee?

59:01.000 --> 59:02.639
What about your mum?

59:02.640 --> 59:03.920
She'll be asleep.

59:06.080 --> 59:07.360
Your sister?

59:08.480 --> 59:10.439
She'll give you the once
over and then leave.

59:10.440 --> 59:14.839
Eyes wide if she approves and mouth
like this if she doesn't.

59:14.840 --> 59:18.360
I tell you what, mate,
we're both getting off at Madison.

59:44.120 --> 59:46.000
Just up here on the right.

59:50.240 --> 59:53.359
Oh, my God, what's happened?

59:53.360 --> 59:55.080
Oh, God.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.759
Are you Jenny Northwood? Yeah.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.199
And this lady? Yeah, it's my mam.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.240
What's happened?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.479
Hiya. How's things?

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.639
Fine.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.039
Yeah, how's Mam?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.359
Fine, everything is fine.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.839
You just go and enjoy yourself.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.880
I'm at home, Claire, with Mam.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.719
I'm sorry, Jenny, I'm really sorry.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.999
They wouldn't even know
what to do with her,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.119
only she was wearing
the bracelet that I got her.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.000
I said, "How lucky was that?"

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.879
Sorry. It's OK.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.839
I had to go to Jenny's last night and...

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.199
...I didn't get back until late,
I'm really sorry.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.999
It's OK, it's fine.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.599
Claire, love, I have been
meaning to ask you this, anyway.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.159
Do you need some time
off to be with your mum a bit more?

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.319
What? I can sort that for you
if you want.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.399
No, I'm fine, thanks.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.080
Are you sure?

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.920
Positive.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.920
Mam!

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.560
Mam!

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.240
Mam!

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.080
Daddy!
Hey, you all right?

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.039
How is she?

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.000
No news yet.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.519
I wondered whose it was. What?

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.400
The broomstick outside.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.839
Oh, have they eaten?

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.159
No, and no cheesy chips again, please.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.159
What about a fish supper?

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.200
Yeah!
You can afford that, can you?

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.880
Just about, yeah.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.999
Right, come on, girls.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.839
Let's leave Auntie Claire
to her cackling.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.559
This way.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.160
Bye, girls. BOTH: Bye, Mummy!

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.959
Now, you have already got a care
package settled for Mary

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.519
and they will keep that open
for as long as they possibly can.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.919
Sadly, the longer she stays here,

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.999
the more her care package is threatened,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.319
so it is in all of our best
interests to get Mary home again

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.759
as soon as possible.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.359
Now, the scan does show...

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.839
Sorry, you're hurdling ahead here.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.479
Am I? Yes.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.679
We've not seen our mother yet,
nor any doctor who treated her,

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.359
nor any nurse who cared for her,

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.359
but you're already throwing her out.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.119
I'm throwing nobody out, I assure you.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.279
What is your title again?
Claire.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.079
Discharge liaison officer.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.839
It used to be you'd come into hospital

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.359
and leave when you got better.
You can't do that any more.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.039
Not enough beds, not enough money.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.919
So you are here doing a job
that shouldn't even exist.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.240
I'm here to help this unit run
as efficiently as possible.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.160
Would you like to see your mother now?

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:05.399
It doesn't help, you know?
Having a go at them.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.999
What, do you think if we were nice
to her, she would be nice to Mum?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.880
No, she sees niceness as weakness.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.160
Hi, hiya.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.280
Ow! Stop! Stop!

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.599
Stop! Sh, sh.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.079
Has she hit you before?

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.400
Well...

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.199
I was struggling with
her in the car once,

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.719
she caught me on the nose.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.239
But I think that was an accident.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.279
That is the first time
she's done it and meant it.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.319
Why do you think she did it?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.360
Because she's back in the hospital,
she hates it there.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.879
We'll find her somewhere else.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:05.200
We did.
She went missing five minutes later.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.799
You're thinking of bringing her
back here, aren't you?

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.639
Hi, sorry I'm not
at home,

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.919
leave a message and I'll get
back to you.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.039
Um, about that coffee...

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:30.399
I wondered if we could, you know,
maybe try again some time?

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.720
Coffee?

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.279
Look, you tried having her back
here and you failed.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.919
But you got a lucky break.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.479
A lucky break? Yes.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.919
I'm sorry to be brutal,
but, yes, a lucky break.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.119
And she's back in there now

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.079
and she is their responsibility
and not yours.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.399
They will do it so much
better than you ever will,

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.199
because that's what
they are trained for.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.880
Tell me you won't bring her back here.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.079
Why do you want to do it, anyway?

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.399
Half the time she doesn't
even recognise you.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.199
You're doing it because she's your
mother

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.519
and you've got to be seen to
be looking after your mother.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.960
It's out of guilt and fear
of what the neighbours will say.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.720
Her life's over, Jenny,
don't let her ruin yours.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.719
Do you know what?

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.439
I do feel guilty, yeah.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.279
But what about you, Claire?

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.639
Better to lock me mother
up in a home than see me sister

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.279
running around like a blue-arsed
fly making me feel so guilty

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.720
cos I do fuck all.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.600
Hi.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.920
Say something.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.520
I'm sorry.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.120
Do you know the best thing a mother
can do for her children?

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.520
Die.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.120
You are so wrong.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.240
Oh, thank you. There we are.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.119
Oh, look, please say you'll have her.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.439
I don't know how long
she's got left, you know,

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.959
and I just don't want to spend it

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.119
being worried sick about her,
I just want her to be comfortable.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.999
Well, we've got what she needs.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.119
Round-the-clock nursing care,
doctor on duty

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.799
or on call 24 hours a day,

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.199
and a good staff to patient ratio.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.720
Of course we'll have her.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.879
Thank you.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.319
But it is 700 a week.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.600
You'd have to fund that from
the sale of your mother's house.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.919
She doesn't own her house, you see.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.599
Well, it's a council house

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.639
and she wouldn't pay it on principle.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.079
Does she have any other assets?
No.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.519
Then the council would
put 400 towards it.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.359
And the rest?

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.400
Well, you'd have to find that.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.880
I wish you hadn't shown me around now.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.080
You've tried for NHS
Continuing Healthcare?

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.360
What?

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.320
Hiya, Jen.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.039
What?

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.800
And we can do that?

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.799
Hello, I'm Rebecca Compton,
I'm head of the stroke unit here.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.559
You are?
Jenny. And you must be Claire.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.359
Yes. Sorry it's taken
until now to meet,

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.039
but I have been on secondment.
You know Amanda?

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.479
Yes, we've had the pleasure.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.039
Right, how's it going?

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.199
Well, we've seen two nursing
homes that are suitable

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.799
and two that aren't.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.039
And the two that are, we can't afford.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.839
People do find that they need
to lower their sights a bit.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.079
We have done.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.679
Often it's just appearances.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.399
The standard of care no different.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.279
Take Belle Vista, for instance.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.719
It looks a bit basic, but it is good.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.679
We've put my mum in Belle Vista.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.600
They lost her the same day.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.359
Well, we're not trying to put
you under any pressure whatsoever,

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.639
but we could do with that bed,
of course.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.439
We understand that.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.199
Can I read you something?

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.480
Of course.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.279
"When your need for care
is primarily due to your need

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.519
"for health care,

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.679
"you may be eligible for NHS
Continuing Healthcare.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:21.079
"A complete package of ongoing care
arranged and funded by the NHS

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.039
"to meet physical or mental health
needs that have arisen

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.239
"because of disability,
accident or illness."

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.119
Why didn't you mention this?

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.719
I thought we did.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.279
You didn't.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.319
Well, we did assess her informally
and she didn't qualify, so...

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.879
Well, can you do it formally, please?

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.839
Well, that would be a waste
of time, I'm afraid.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.319
We would do that only if you insist.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.680
Oh, we insist.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.039
OK.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.560
But don't build your hopes up.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.400
Please, don't do that.

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.839
Auntie Claire! Auntie Claire!

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.719
Hiya!

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.679
Claire with eclairs!

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.400
Hey! Not for you!
Hands off! Your mum.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.600
Is, um, Nick still on the scene?

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.960
This came this morning.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.440
Mum's assessment.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.199
It's been rejected.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.560
Is he married?

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.200
What do we do?
We appeal.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.079
Is he married?

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.319
No.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.360
Good.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.879
Don't attack them.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.560
Do you want to do it?

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.920
If you'd like to take a seat?

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.320
Good morning.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.439
My name is James Simpson
and I will be chairing

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.279
this independent review panel
scrutiny of the rejection

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.039
of Mary Taylor's application for
NHS Continuing Healthcare.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.999
Could we all please introduce ourselves?

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.319
Angela Bellman, geriatric nurse.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.719
David Tully, psychiatric nurse.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.679
Shirley Woodford, social
services administrator.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.799
Jenny Northwood, Mary's daughter.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.399
Claire Taylor, Mary's daughter.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.799
We were expecting someone
from the hospital,

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.399
but as it is well past ten o'clock,

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.399
we'll make a start without them.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.639
I apologise that you have
been kept waiting.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:10.159
Hi, I'm so sorry,
I was held up on the ward.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.479
If you would like to give
us your name, take a seat,

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.759
we'll carry on.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.039
Yeah. Amanda Jennings,
discharge liaison officer,

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.120
standing in for Rebecca Compton,
head of the stroke unit.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.639
First, I'd like to invite
members of the panel to ask you both

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.840
any questions they may have.
Is that all right with you?

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.719
Can you tell us a bit
about your mother before the stroke?

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.520
She was very independent.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.799
She's lived on her own since Dad died.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.239
She did everything for herself.

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.080
Did she have mobility problems? No.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.279
Her knee sometimes, but...

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.239
And did she have any hobbies?

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.880
Politics, in general.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.360
Labour Party in particular.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.199
Liked the telly.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.040
Wildlife shows, bit of drama, Newsnight.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.480
And her personality?

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.959
Self-contained, very proud,
very principled.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.279
And directly after the stroke,
did her personality change?

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.520
Yes.

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.279
She became noisy, uninhibited, angry.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:25.879
She kept seeing my father
in every man on the ward.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.799
And how is her behaviour now?

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.159
Even worse.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.679
Jenny's called in nearly
every day to feed and medicate her,

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.359
because the staff can't cope.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.999
She is violent and lashes out at them,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.199
out of terror, I think.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.520
Or pain.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.920
Can I...?

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.880
Why all this?

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.799
I'll tell you why.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.199
Money.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.439
There's nearly a million
old people with dementia

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.719
and to give them the treatment
they need costs serious money.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.199
And why spend serious money on the old?

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.759
Hence all this.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.199
Hence you, Amanda, barring the gates,

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.639
playing God with people's lives.
Well, that's fine.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.799
But you are not going to do it
with my mother's.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.200
I'm sorry, just give me...

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.280
I'm sorry, Jenny. I'm sorry.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.440
There's a report in front of you.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.519
I think you will remember, Amanda,

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.239
that we went to the Court of Protection

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.079
cos Mum wasn't capable
of granting us power of attorney.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.240
Yeah.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.159
To do that, you need
a consultant report,

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:55.160
so I'd like to read
that to you, if I may.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.879
"Mrs Taylor has suffered a major
stroke and has developed

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.279
"severe cognitive impairment.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.639
"She has expressive and receptive
dysphasia

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.079
"and cannot retain information.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:12.479
"She is confused
and fails to understand.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.319
"It is extremely difficult
to communicate with her.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:18.319
"She was found wandering the ward,
agitated and occasionally

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.719
"very aggressive.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.159
"Mrs..." Sorry.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.239
"Mrs Taylor has significant
mental health issues

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.439
"and has lost
the ability to make decisions.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.639
"There has been no evidence
of any improvement.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.599
"It is likely that these adverse
effects will be long-term.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.039
"She needs supervision and 24-hour
care from qualified nursing staff

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.439
"for her medication and other
daily activities."

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.919
He seems to think she's seriously ill.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:46.480
You seem to think she's fine.
Why such a difference?

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.679
There's another form in front of you.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:01.600
This is the questionnaire
that my mother supposedly filled in.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.639
This is the document
that I think cost my mother

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.520
her continuing health care.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.559
"Do you feel happy?"

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.199
Answer A, all of the time,

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.400
B, most of the time,
C, rarely, D, never.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.239
My mother has answered,
B, most of the time.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.759
And there's lots of other
questions on there,

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.559
as you can see, that my mother's
answered A's and B's for,

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.239
nothing critical whatsoever.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:31.679
So this woman who the
consultant described as

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:35.319
"unable to understand
and difficult to communicate with"

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.560
has answered every single answer
on this form.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.599
Are you saying someone else
filled it in?

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.159
Yeah, I am.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.959
I mean, if you gave my mother
a form, she'd eat it.

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.200
Miss Jennings?

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.880
I can't explain it, I'm afraid.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.800
Anything else?

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.680
Yeah.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.319
My mum has been in hospital
just twice before.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.880
When she had me and when she had Claire.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.439
Apart from that, she has not
cost the NHS a penny,

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.759
yet she's contributed to it
her whole working life.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.160
Well, now she's sick.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.039
She needs 24-hour nursing care.

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.199
She needs a doctor, a counsellor,
a gastroenterologist,

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.879
a physiotherapist,
my mother deserves these things.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.160
She deserves a place
that meets her needs.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.760
Anything else?

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:54.920
Miss Jennings?

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.239
In that case, can I ask you both
to step outside for five minutes

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.600
whilst we have a quick chat?
Thank you.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.599
Hi. Hi.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.479
Thanks.

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.520
A disadvantage. Yeah.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.480
I'm sorry.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.920
Can I say something?

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.599
I'd like to give you all a break,

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:08.479
treat dementia with the seriousness
it deserves in hospitals like mine.

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.280
But do you know what that means?

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.519
A nurse being called away

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:16.479
from a young person fighting for life,

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:19.240
because an old woman
in the next room has shit herself.

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.560
Please come in.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.280
Thank you for your patience.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:53.040
A committee must decide only
on the evidence before us.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.119
However, we are in agreement
that this assessment does not

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.159
accurately reflect the state
of Mary's health

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.959
and we are therefore ordering a
new assessment to be carried out

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.719
as soon as possible.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.559
This will take a while.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.960
But I can tell you now that we are
minded to allow your appeal.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.719
So you should go ahead and look
for a nursing home

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.959
that can cater for Mary's needs.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.559
And if, as I believe,
you have already found one,

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:22.240
perhaps you should start
talking seriously to them.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:28.199
You will receive a letter confirming
this over the next couple of weeks.

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.320
Thank you. Thank you for
your time, good to meet you.

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.840
There you go. That's it.

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.960
We're thinking of adopting.

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.680
I've been on the IVF
for a while now and...

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.560
...so, we're trying something else.

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.720
Hello, Mary.
