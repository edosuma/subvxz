WEBVTT

00:09.909 --> 00:12.310
Excuse me, do you have
a phone I can borrow?

00:12.343 --> 00:15.080
We're closed now.
Try across the road, yeah?

00:15.114 --> 00:16.315
Okay.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.439
- Hey, Kelly.
- Stay away from me.

03:26.972 --> 03:29.442
- Where were you?
- Fell asleep.

03:30.141 --> 03:32.211
- Where?
- Just at a friend's.

03:32.411 --> 03:33.512
Is that
what you call him?

03:33.544 --> 03:34.780
She got brought home
by the police.

03:36.581 --> 03:39.150
- Why didn't you get a bus?
- You told me to wait for you.

03:39.183 --> 03:40.953
I thought I could rely
on you.

03:40.985 --> 03:42.655
You're lucky we
got back here before him.

03:42.687 --> 03:44.556
- And so he doesn't know.
- Not yet.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.326
- Grow up.
- How about you grow up? No mum.

03:47.359 --> 03:49.161
Kelly! Did you hear that?

03:49.193 --> 03:51.396
- I'm really glad you're...
- That's enough.

03:54.599 --> 03:56.602
- Just quiet.
- Hear what she just called me?

03:56.634 --> 03:58.770
Shh, just quiet
for a minute.

03:58.804 --> 04:00.439
We've had enough
arguments in this house.

04:21.093 --> 04:22.028
Dad.

05:09.274 --> 05:10.910
I shouldn't have come here
last night.

05:11.476 --> 05:14.012
Thanks. Why not?

05:22.920 --> 05:26.591
I know you'd rather
I wasn't here. I understand

05:27.759 --> 05:31.230
but this is a bit of a
pattern emerging, isn't it?

05:31.262 --> 05:33.832
Once, over a year ago.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.706
You know, I could stay.

05:41.839 --> 05:43.675
What, with your
mum and sister?

05:45.810 --> 05:47.813
I think you know what I mean.

05:50.081 --> 05:53.218
I'm struggling with my sister.

05:54.353 --> 05:57.990
What has she done?
You never explained any of this.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.127
I don't think you can
blame Yakira for it all.

06:04.430 --> 06:07.400
I'm hoping some time apart
might be good for the girls.

06:07.432 --> 06:10.103
I'm supposed to try
to keep families together.

06:10.802 --> 06:12.771
Some time apart might be
a good thing for the girls

06:12.805 --> 06:15.540
but because there's been
a previous referral here,

06:15.574 --> 06:17.443
that doesn't change
things much for us.

06:17.475 --> 06:19.110
Yes, but the police
overreacted last time.

06:19.144 --> 06:21.881
That would be
mentioned in the assessment.

06:21.913 --> 06:23.081
The assessment?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.286
Yakira,
you walk around in a cloud,

06:27.319 --> 06:28.688
expecting me to see through it.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.425
I'm trying.

06:33.992 --> 06:35.361
Always trying,
always failing.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.795
You never even
answer your phone.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.298
- I told you don't say always.
- Talk then.

06:39.331 --> 06:41.233
You always say always
and I don't always anything.

06:41.266 --> 06:43.402
Now you're sabotaging
the conversation.

06:43.435 --> 06:44.536
For fuck's sake.

06:44.735 --> 06:47.473
I'm required to make
a section 47 inquiry.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.012
You can always leave.

06:56.314 --> 06:57.983
How are you going
to make an assessment

06:58.016 --> 06:59.585
if Yakira's not living here?

06:59.617 --> 07:03.288
The focus for the inquiry
will be more on you, Michelle.

07:06.725 --> 07:07.760
Like you said,

07:08.994 --> 07:11.063
I don't think Yakira's
to blame for it all.

07:25.043 --> 07:31.350
I just want this to be
a nice calm conversation.

07:31.550 --> 07:35.855
It's a chance for us all to talk
as a family, together.

07:38.891 --> 07:44.697
Girls. So, family stuff.

07:46.598 --> 07:49.701
We, your mother and I, we're
looking for the right moment

07:49.901 --> 07:53.338
to give you more detail
about our plans.

07:54.572 --> 07:57.876
We're making some changes
to our lives.

07:58.076 --> 07:59.411
- We know that.
- Kell.

07:59.444 --> 08:01.112
- Kell, stop.
- Thank you.

08:02.781 --> 08:05.918
So, I'm going to be moving out.
Yaki's coming with me.

08:07.218 --> 08:09.187
It's something
we talked about a lot

08:09.221 --> 08:10.756
and we feel that it's right.

08:10.788 --> 08:13.192
Kels, you're going to be
staying here with your mum.

08:13.225 --> 08:16.028
Sorry, it's not that it's right
just... It's the best thing.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.497
The best thing? No,
right now it's the right thing,

08:19.398 --> 08:20.833
the right thing to do.

08:20.865 --> 08:22.935
Kels, could you please stop
tipping back on your chair?

08:22.968 --> 08:24.670
- She's okay.
- Okay.

08:25.803 --> 08:27.572
We just think it's appropriate,

08:27.605 --> 08:30.408
given the circumstances,
that your sister comes with me.

08:30.442 --> 08:32.677
- Oh, thank God.
- Kelly.

08:32.878 --> 08:34.446
Dad,
can you just get on with it?

08:34.479 --> 08:36.381
Well, I'm trying to explain it.

08:36.414 --> 08:39.751
- We're going to spend time apart
- A trial separation.

08:39.784 --> 08:40.952
That's nice.

08:42.486 --> 08:43.788
If all goes well,

08:43.822 --> 08:45.691
we're not gonna see
each other again.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.092
We're trying to do what's best
for everyone, Yakira.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.728
- Dad, can you talk normally?
- Well...

08:50.761 --> 08:52.430
So, we've decided on a day...

08:52.464 --> 08:53.966
Sorry, can I...?
I'm doing this, please.

08:53.999 --> 08:56.936
- It's just for moving stuff out.
- When?

08:56.969 --> 08:58.237
Can you just tell them?

08:58.269 --> 09:00.038
All right. One thing at a time.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.206
We're going to be
moving some stuff out,

09:02.240 --> 09:04.576
get rid of some
clutter around here.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.911
- What, like me?
- Darling.

09:05.943 --> 09:07.413
A bit of space.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.716
Ugh, can someone
just answer me?

09:11.750 --> 09:13.885
It's not like it's the end.
Nobody has died.

09:15.953 --> 09:17.522
When are we moving?

09:17.556 --> 09:19.725
Kels, could you stop
tipping back in your chair?

09:20.424 --> 09:22.727
We're going to be moving
things out in two stages.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.529
- When are we moving?
- Sorry?

09:24.562 --> 09:26.298
Will you just talk to me?

09:28.265 --> 09:30.602
- We're moving in two stages.
- Sunday.

09:30.635 --> 09:32.671
- What?
- Can I just...? Sunday.

09:34.405 --> 09:36.708
- we're going to my brother's.
- Tony's?

09:36.741 --> 09:37.742
Yeah.

09:38.976 --> 09:40.745
Tony's in Edinburgh.

09:41.379 --> 09:43.249
- The other side of the country.
- Darling.

09:44.115 --> 09:45.283
Are you joking?

09:45.317 --> 09:46.686
Are you fucking joking, man?

09:46.884 --> 09:48.553
Don't swear
in front of your sister.

09:48.586 --> 09:51.122
It's not forever,
it's just for a bit,

09:51.155 --> 09:52.957
just while we sort things out.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.759
- No.
- Yakira, it's not that far away.

09:54.793 --> 09:56.794
Oh, for God's sake.

09:56.827 --> 09:58.630
- Look what's happened.
- It was an accident.

09:58.663 --> 10:00.633
- You stopped me from telling her
- It doesn't matter.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.768
- Why are we going to Edinburgh?
- Doesn't matter?

10:02.801 --> 10:05.070
They were wedding presents,
it doesn't matter.

10:05.102 --> 10:06.404
Haven't we been
through enough?

10:06.437 --> 10:07.773
I use those decanters.

10:07.806 --> 10:09.575
From my sister and her husband,
you didn't like them.

10:09.607 --> 10:11.409
- What's that got to do with it?
- They bought us the decanter.

10:11.442 --> 10:13.712
- What's that got to do with it?
- You remember our wedding?

10:13.912 --> 10:16.148
- Not if I can fucking help it.
- Dad, don't swear.

10:16.181 --> 10:18.718
- Sorry, Kelly.
- Move, darling, there's glass.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.387
- Impossible.
- Where's Yakira?

10:25.490 --> 10:27.525
- Are you all right?
- Mmh.

10:29.995 --> 10:31.630
Go on, off you go.

11:37.995 --> 11:38.997
Where's dad?

11:44.001 --> 11:46.572
- I've had a difficult day.
- You've had a difficult day.

11:46.772 --> 11:51.076
- Yeah. I need to talk to Kelly.
- I need to talk to you.

11:52.778 --> 11:57.682
She can't call me "no mum".
I have a mum.

11:58.015 --> 11:59.851
I understand but at this rate

11:59.884 --> 12:02.087
you're not going to have
a sister.

12:05.791 --> 12:09.361
You don't understand that,
Michelle.

12:12.964 --> 12:16.135
- And why is she always protected?
- Because she's a kid

12:17.836 --> 12:20.305
- and you're not a kid anymore.
- I still get treated like one.

12:20.337 --> 12:22.573
- You've got me into trouble.
- How?

12:22.606 --> 12:25.009
Police have got
Social Services involved.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.047
They were here this afternoon.

12:36.288 --> 12:39.057
We were a pretty good family
for a while, weren't we?

12:41.625 --> 12:43.161
I thought we were.

12:45.697 --> 12:48.466
I don't want you girls
to lose touch but

12:49.868 --> 12:52.037
you're making things difficult.

13:34.812 --> 13:36.347
It's me.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.019
Yakira,
how can I be of assistance?

13:46.024 --> 13:47.893
How do I get out of this mess?

13:49.360 --> 13:52.331
You live at 47 Mount End Road.

13:53.331 --> 13:57.036
At the top of Mount End Road,
turn left onto Banks Lane.

13:58.003 --> 14:02.241
From Banks Lane
turn right onto the A121 South.

14:02.274 --> 14:06.312
Traffic congestion is at a
minimum at this off peak time.

15:08.273 --> 15:12.911
Mum. Mum.

19:41.945 --> 19:44.281
An alert's gone out
as it involves a minor.

19:44.315 --> 19:45.383
Right.

19:45.415 --> 19:48.720
Do you have any idea
of a motive?

19:48.752 --> 19:50.021
No.

19:50.221 --> 19:53.057
None of them have
mentioned anything to you?

19:53.090 --> 19:55.459
We're going through
a family separation.

19:58.663 --> 20:01.032
- You said Kelly was 12.
- Yeah.

20:02.933 --> 20:04.970
- It would be abduction.
- Look, I just want them back.

20:05.002 --> 20:06.437
Of course.

20:07.571 --> 20:10.741
Any history
we should know about?

20:10.775 --> 20:12.611
No alcohol
or substance abuse?

20:12.644 --> 20:14.546
No, Yakira wouldn't touch
anything like that.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.748
She doesn't even smoke.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.082
Mobile?

20:18.115 --> 20:19.951
Yeah. Yakira,
she has a phone.

20:19.983 --> 20:22.221
I've called it all morning.
There's no answer.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.789
Can we try it again?

20:29.259 --> 20:30.295
May I?

20:41.372 --> 20:43.008
Leave it ringing.

21:03.661 --> 21:06.030
- Is that Yakira's?
- Yeah, it's her phone.

21:19.977 --> 21:22.214
- Kelly.
- Where the hell are we?

21:22.413 --> 21:24.782
Somewhere in the South,
South Downs.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.418
How long
have we been driving?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.420
I don't know,
like two, three hours.

21:35.526 --> 21:38.630
I'm in my fucking pyjamas.
You bitch.

22:01.285 --> 22:03.689
Yakira, let me out now.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.790
Yakira, fucking get me
out of here.

22:06.824 --> 22:09.361
Yakira, when mum finds out,
she'll not be happy.

22:09.559 --> 22:11.796
Get me out of this thing,
okay?

22:11.828 --> 22:15.366
I'm literally not playing.
Get me out of here right now.

22:15.566 --> 22:16.968
Yakira.

22:21.571 --> 22:23.007
Is there anything else
we should know about?

22:25.143 --> 22:27.746
Have either of the girls been
in any trouble before?

22:27.778 --> 22:31.115
No. They're good girls.

22:31.148 --> 22:33.517
- Any problems recently?
- No.

22:42.192 --> 22:44.229
So, apparently Kelly was
picked up the night before last.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.297
- No.
- Yeah.

22:46.830 --> 22:48.332
She had a panic attack.

22:48.365 --> 22:50.969
- She got locked in the cinema.
- What?

22:51.001 --> 22:53.571
- No chance to tell you.
- Are you for real?

22:53.770 --> 22:55.773
Her sister was meant
to be meeting her.

22:56.473 --> 22:59.043
There's a referral for
a Social Services inquiry.

23:00.877 --> 23:03.747
Yakira, let me out.
I can't breathe. Yakira.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.582
I'm gonna let you out.
Just calm down, okay?

23:05.615 --> 23:06.718
Let me out!

23:09.420 --> 23:10.689
Yakira.

24:06.277 --> 24:08.046
How hard can it be?

24:08.078 --> 24:10.214
You lot, you put fucking
cameras everywhere.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.283
You know what,
there's probably one on me now.

24:12.316 --> 24:15.252
How is it if I go two miles
over the speed limit,

24:15.286 --> 24:17.622
by the time I get home
there's a fine on my doormat

24:17.654 --> 24:20.090
and you can't find two girls.

24:20.124 --> 24:24.229
It's a 1980s glacier
blue 5 Series BMW.

24:24.261 --> 24:27.065
I mean, it's not like there's
many of them on the road.

24:27.097 --> 24:29.768
This isn't Finding fucking Nemo.

24:35.940 --> 24:37.375
- Thank you.
- Fucking hell.

24:37.575 --> 24:39.110
- Get out of my car.
- Whoa.

24:39.143 --> 24:41.946
- Get out of my car. Jesus.
- Sorry, sorry, it's okay.

24:41.979 --> 24:44.949
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
I thought you pulled up for me.

24:44.981 --> 24:46.218
No, no, I stopped...

24:46.416 --> 24:48.151
I thought you saw me
back there with my thumb out.

24:48.184 --> 24:50.288
I stopped for a piss.
Just get out of my car now.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.423
- Okay. I'm leaving the car.
- Let me out of here.

24:53.457 --> 24:55.494
Help me. Help me, please.

24:58.762 --> 25:02.567
- She's just... Please get out.
- Don't get out. Please help me.

25:02.599 --> 25:04.168
- I've been kidnapped. She's crazy
- She's Kell.

25:04.367 --> 25:07.672
- Just get me out of here, please
- That's my sister.

25:07.872 --> 25:09.707
We've had a little
misunderstanding

25:09.740 --> 25:11.509
and I'm just giving her
a bit of time to calm down.

25:11.709 --> 25:14.112
Don't go. Please do not leave.
Help me get out of here.

25:14.144 --> 25:15.680
- She's okay. She's fine.
- In the boot.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.716
Yakira, you're such a bitch.

25:18.782 --> 25:22.252
Yakira, get me out.
Where are we going?

25:22.286 --> 25:23.654
Can someone talk to me?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.223
- Get me out of the boot.
- Just get out of my car, please.

25:25.256 --> 25:26.724
It's not her car, okay?
It's my dad's.

25:26.757 --> 25:30.260
- You need to get out right now.
- I'll get out.

25:30.294 --> 25:31.629
- No, don't go.
- Thank you.

25:31.662 --> 25:33.531
After you've taken me
to Westbury.

25:33.730 --> 25:34.932
No. No way.

25:34.965 --> 25:36.934
- I've got to get there.
- Yakira.

25:36.968 --> 25:38.970
- That's not my problem.
- Yakira, who the hell

25:39.002 --> 25:40.538
- is it in the car? Yakira.
- It is now.

25:40.738 --> 25:43.107
- Get out now.
- I will call the police.

25:46.143 --> 25:50.114
No, no, no.
You don't need to do that.

25:55.185 --> 25:59.957
Yakira. Yakira,
get me out now.

26:00.758 --> 26:03.662
Yakira, you've got
to get me out of here.

26:03.861 --> 26:07.365
Right, whoever that is,
get me out of here. Yakira.

26:07.397 --> 26:09.199
For fuck's sake, man.

26:31.454 --> 26:33.223
Come out now, Kelly,
if you want to talk.

26:33.257 --> 26:34.759
After you drop me off.

26:54.010 --> 26:55.946
She can stay in there for a bit

26:55.980 --> 26:58.048
No, we need
to let her out of there.

26:58.249 --> 27:01.720
- Why?
- She has panic attacks.

27:04.055 --> 27:05.156
Right.

27:44.828 --> 27:46.998
I'm taking you
to see my mum.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.172
I promise it'll make sense
when we're there.

27:56.106 --> 27:58.442
Am I supposed to care?

28:12.222 --> 28:13.390
No.

28:19.896 --> 28:21.265
There was a time

28:22.932 --> 28:26.070
when we were all supposed to go

28:27.104 --> 28:28.573
visit the grave.

28:31.307 --> 28:33.443
I overheard Dad say to Michelle

28:33.477 --> 28:35.947
that it would be
too upsetting for you

28:40.884 --> 28:44.422
and I really hated you for that.

28:44.454 --> 28:47.224
But that wasn't my fault.

28:47.258 --> 28:49.760
No. I know that now.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.002
How old were you
when she died?

29:04.040 --> 29:05.576
I was seven.

29:10.213 --> 29:12.916
Then he had you the next year.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.389
That wasn't my fault either.

29:20.023 --> 29:21.225
No.

29:24.394 --> 29:26.631
But it was too much for me.

29:30.201 --> 29:31.669
Can I have a hug?

29:38.308 --> 29:39.778
Yakira, can I have a hug?

30:06.737 --> 30:08.406
- Leave me alone.
- Fuck's sake. Kelly.

30:08.439 --> 30:10.375
Kelly. Come here.

30:11.307 --> 30:13.310
- Get away from me.
- Kelly, come back here.

30:13.344 --> 30:14.778
Stop running.

30:22.152 --> 30:25.155
No, I haven't...
I've never seen that.

30:26.289 --> 30:27.826
I don't know where
they get such a thing.

30:30.861 --> 30:33.998
Get off me. Fuck you. Get off.

30:34.030 --> 30:38.903
Get that fucking car running.

30:39.103 --> 30:41.206
Get off me.

30:41.805 --> 30:44.741
What's this got to do
with finding our daughters?

30:44.942 --> 30:46.844
I'm sorry, I just...

30:46.876 --> 30:48.413
I don't understand
your logic here.

30:48.612 --> 30:50.348
Why would they have it?

30:50.381 --> 30:52.650
- Why would they've thrown it out?
- Good question.

30:52.682 --> 30:55.252
Does it matter if they threw
the fucking Pope out of the car?

30:55.451 --> 30:56.988
I don't want
that thing in my house.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.423
I don't want
a discussion about it.

30:58.622 --> 31:00.057
I want our daughters found

31:00.089 --> 31:01.958
and I want to talk about
how we're gonna find them.

31:01.991 --> 31:04.261
We just need to know if
it was in the car to start with.

31:04.295 --> 31:07.932
- In the car, out the car, it's..
- Because it could be a lead.

31:07.964 --> 31:11.234
If they bought it, we need to
find where they got it and why,

31:11.268 --> 31:14.404
and that's gonna take up
resources, time, money.

31:14.438 --> 31:16.440
Resources taken away
from finding them.

31:16.472 --> 31:18.576
What, is this some kind
of police funding sob story?

31:18.608 --> 31:19.943
Mr Lovegrove.

31:19.977 --> 31:21.379
Well, you may as well
pass the fucking hat around.

31:21.577 --> 31:23.480
- Paul.
- Well, come on. I mean...

31:23.513 --> 31:25.916
But it could lead us to them.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.219
But if it was in the car
already, it couldn't.

31:29.619 --> 31:30.854
Simple as that.

31:34.991 --> 31:38.828
- Okay. So, it wasn't in the car.
- Right.

31:38.862 --> 31:40.999
- Can we move on now, please?
- Sure.

31:41.999 --> 31:44.736
So, we'll put someone on it.
See what we can find out.

31:44.934 --> 31:46.069
Okay.

31:58.147 --> 32:01.451
Don't put someone on it.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.987
What are you talking about?

32:09.425 --> 32:10.461
It was...

32:12.628 --> 32:14.631
- It was in the car.
- What?

32:15.932 --> 32:19.136
- It was in the car.
- It's yours.

32:24.307 --> 32:25.876
Yes, it's mine.

32:32.348 --> 32:33.617
The fuel is low.

32:35.652 --> 32:38.489
There's a garage
just in front. Yeah.

32:42.692 --> 32:44.228
Put this on.

34:59.695 --> 35:03.634
Mum. Mum.

35:13.143 --> 35:14.345
Help me.

35:15.445 --> 35:17.347
Help, I've been kidnapped.
Call the police.

35:17.547 --> 35:19.683
Hey, get your phone out, film it
and send it to the police, okay?

35:19.882 --> 35:21.351
I need you to get me out of
here.

35:22.152 --> 35:24.655
- Please help me get out of here.
- Fuck.

35:36.900 --> 35:37.835
Go.

35:43.974 --> 35:47.443
- Yakira, what are you doing?
- Just calm down.

35:47.476 --> 35:49.045
- I'm trying to help you out.
- Get off of me.

35:49.246 --> 35:50.381
Stop the car and get off me.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.717
Why are you letting him
do this? Yakira.

35:52.916 --> 35:56.820
You're such a fucking
weirdo. Get off of me.

35:56.853 --> 35:59.757
Everybody calm down. I'll pull
over in two seconds, okay?

35:59.789 --> 36:01.492
Turn left the next junction.

36:01.692 --> 36:03.827
- Turn left.
- Okay, I'm turning left.

36:04.027 --> 36:05.429
Get off me.

36:05.461 --> 36:07.697
Keep fucking quiet
and you're all right. Okay?

36:07.731 --> 36:08.766
Fuck.

36:13.402 --> 36:14.605
Where is it?

36:18.141 --> 36:21.945
- Got rid of it.
- Like it never happened.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.883
Yes, let's sweep it
under the carpet and forget it.

36:25.916 --> 36:27.585
Ugh, what does that
even mean?

36:27.617 --> 36:29.719
Like the kids. Like me.

36:29.753 --> 36:31.789
Like anything
that's too tough to face.

36:31.822 --> 36:33.024
- What about your secrets?
- Fine. Sure.

36:33.222 --> 36:34.891
Have a go at me
about the cinema fiasco.

36:34.925 --> 36:36.627
You were supposed
to take them, remember?

36:36.659 --> 36:38.127
Don't guilt me.
It doesn't excuse...

36:38.161 --> 36:40.130
Anyway, I didn't say I would.

36:40.163 --> 36:42.733
I said I might,
be able to take them.

36:42.766 --> 36:46.003
Well, now I know why you
couldn't, thanks to the police.

36:53.277 --> 36:55.012
You checked out on them, Paul,

36:56.646 --> 36:59.115
and now Yakira's
checked out on Kelly.

36:59.148 --> 37:00.884
- Don't you get it?
- It's not true.

37:00.916 --> 37:01.985
What's not true?

37:02.184 --> 37:03.621
That your kids
don't learn from you?

37:05.521 --> 37:06.990
Wake up.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.630
- Keep going.
- Yakira.

37:15.565 --> 37:16.833
Where are we going?

37:38.088 --> 37:40.191
Are you saying it's my fault?

37:42.759 --> 37:44.228
- Wake up.
- Stop fucking dreaming.

38:57.934 --> 39:00.571
I think I need you
out of here for a bit.

39:02.606 --> 39:06.377
No, if we can just
get through this, then...

39:06.409 --> 39:08.144
I think we're done.

39:12.849 --> 39:14.385
Where am I gonna go?

39:16.585 --> 39:17.821
I don't care.

39:28.731 --> 39:29.934
What now?

39:31.001 --> 39:33.504
I've been
monitoring the roads,

39:35.070 --> 39:37.540
let things cool down a bit.

39:37.574 --> 39:39.342
Then we'll leave early.

39:42.778 --> 39:45.349
Drop me at
the edge of the forest.

39:45.548 --> 39:47.284
I'll make my own way
from there.

39:52.556 --> 39:55.092
Do you think the police
are gonna see that video?

39:57.427 --> 39:59.864
The whole fucking world
could have seen it by now.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.601
When you head off, be careful.

40:05.635 --> 40:07.204
There's cameras everywhere.

40:07.403 --> 40:10.273
Plate recognition,
face recognition.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.477
Want to make it home?

40:13.510 --> 40:15.112
Use the B roads.

40:15.846 --> 40:18.382
Don't go through towns,
no motorways,

40:19.615 --> 40:23.119
and don't use your phone.
They'll track it.

40:26.255 --> 40:28.192
I've got to get Kelly back.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.694
Go now, if you like.

40:33.697 --> 40:38.035
But do you have any idea
how bad that video's gonna look?

40:40.369 --> 40:41.672
The car's stolen,

40:43.139 --> 40:45.442
you legged it
without paying for the food

40:45.474 --> 40:48.778
or the petrol
in broad daylight,

40:48.811 --> 40:51.481
she's screaming
at the fucking windows.

40:52.983 --> 40:55.251
They'll want you for abduction.

40:59.856 --> 41:04.528
Here, there's a jacket
in there and some shoes,

41:04.728 --> 41:06.764
it's gonna get cold.

41:09.798 --> 41:13.204
- Supposed to sleep here?
- It's just a few hours.

41:16.072 --> 41:19.977
We'll head back in the morning
and I'll take you straight home.

41:22.512 --> 41:25.950
Why did you have to go and
scream and shout like that?

41:27.117 --> 41:29.519
Why did you have to take me?

41:39.195 --> 41:41.798
Look, I just want
mum and dad, okay?

41:43.365 --> 41:44.835
You call them.

41:52.675 --> 41:53.809
Michelle.

41:53.842 --> 41:56.346
The police
wanna see us first thing.

41:56.378 --> 41:59.717
- Right, okay.
- Be here at 7.30.

42:02.652 --> 42:04.788
Are you all right, Michelle?

42:28.644 --> 42:29.780
Cheers.

42:33.650 --> 42:36.119
Why did you take her for,
anyway?

42:37.253 --> 42:38.556
I don't know.

42:43.025 --> 42:48.965
I had some stuff to say but
we don't talk much back there.

42:52.335 --> 42:55.239
My mum's buried less than
an hour away from here.

43:00.909 --> 43:03.112
I haven't been there
since the funeral.

43:06.949 --> 43:12.088
- What got her?
- Chemotherapy did her in.

43:12.121 --> 43:14.857
Her body couldn't take it.

43:15.057 --> 43:17.126
She had a fit or something,

43:17.159 --> 43:19.028
was taken away in an
ambulance and that was it.

43:27.804 --> 43:30.641
I guess I just wanna
go back to there

43:30.673 --> 43:32.942
and do something different.

43:38.914 --> 43:40.550
It's hard to escape it,
you know.

43:51.161 --> 43:53.963
I just wanna say
a better goodbye, I guess.

44:48.485 --> 44:49.920
What have they done
with Kelly?

44:49.952 --> 44:52.121
She's in the car. Here.

44:52.155 --> 44:55.492
I've been
kidnapped. Call the police.

44:55.525 --> 44:56.992
Can you just call
the police for me, please?

44:57.025 --> 44:59.795
We're obviously taking this
very seriously.

44:59.829 --> 45:01.031
What's going on?

45:01.063 --> 45:02.732
It appears she's keeping
Kelly against her will.

45:02.766 --> 45:04.267
Yeah, I can see that.

45:04.300 --> 45:05.836
That car can't be
on the road without being seen.

45:06.034 --> 45:08.204
- Can you play it again, please?
- Sure.

45:08.237 --> 45:11.174
I've been
kidnapped. Call the police.

45:11.373 --> 45:12.942
Can you just call the police
for me, please?

47:34.983 --> 47:36.420
Yakira?

47:41.657 --> 47:42.759
Yakira.

49:50.385 --> 49:55.192
Kelly, get up,
we've got to go.

49:56.726 --> 49:59.863
You're not gonna fucking
believe it. Kelly.

50:02.398 --> 50:03.700
Kelly!

50:07.469 --> 50:08.337
Kelly!

50:10.672 --> 50:11.774
Kelly?

50:13.509 --> 50:15.978
Kelly, I'm not playing around.

50:19.181 --> 50:20.349
Kells.

50:25.822 --> 50:27.324
Kells.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.070
Kelly. Kelly.

50:56.119 --> 51:00.524
Paul. Oh, sorry,
I was expecting someone.

51:01.958 --> 51:06.596
Sorry, who is it? Kade, Kaden.

51:09.264 --> 51:13.670
Oh. Fine.

51:17.639 --> 51:19.108
Okay, right.

51:22.612 --> 51:23.980
Yeah, that's fine.

51:24.012 --> 51:26.549
No, no, don't come to me.
Yeah, I can come to you.

51:30.753 --> 51:32.222
Kelly.

51:35.525 --> 51:38.161
Kelly. Kells.

52:32.148 --> 52:34.384
Oi. What the fuck
are you doing?

52:36.184 --> 52:37.286
Oi.

52:56.005 --> 52:59.943
Get off me.
I'm trying to find my sister.

54:25.126 --> 54:26.561
Can I help you?

54:26.594 --> 54:28.364
I think you might be
looking for me.

54:28.563 --> 54:31.567
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Kelly. Kelly Lovegrove.

54:31.599 --> 54:33.402
Okay. Go to the door here

54:33.436 --> 54:35.005
and I'll come around
and meet you.

54:41.476 --> 54:42.545
It's me.

54:43.813 --> 54:47.282
How can I be of assistance?

54:47.315 --> 54:50.919
I have to help Kelly.
I've lost her.

54:50.952 --> 54:54.956
- Kelly is with me.
- She's with you?

54:54.989 --> 54:59.828
- Yes, that is correct.
- Where are you?

54:59.862 --> 55:04.334
- I am with Kelly.
- I need help to find her.

55:07.202 --> 55:08.672
Are you okay?

55:10.706 --> 55:12.575
My sister left me.

55:13.909 --> 55:16.413
Well, you're safe now.

55:17.146 --> 55:19.749
I'll get you a glass
of water, okay?

55:19.782 --> 55:22.686
- Say goodbye, Yakira.
- No.

55:24.219 --> 55:28.023
Where is my sister? Is she okay?

55:28.224 --> 55:30.026
I couldn't say.

55:31.994 --> 55:34.197
But she is with you?

55:35.164 --> 55:37.434
Yes, she is with me.

55:38.634 --> 55:40.235
Kelly is with me.

56:03.759 --> 56:06.963
She's got them.
She's got them.

56:28.818 --> 56:32.589
Hello? Please,
I'm looking for a phone.

56:36.125 --> 56:39.762
I've lost my sister and she's 12

56:39.795 --> 56:41.597
and she's lost somewhere here.

56:43.798 --> 56:45.902
I'm really tired

56:45.934 --> 56:47.903
and I just need a phone

56:47.936 --> 56:51.007
so that I can call her
and know that she's safe.

56:52.775 --> 56:55.110
- I'm really sorry.
- No problem. Here.

56:57.679 --> 56:58.980
Thanks.

56:59.014 --> 57:02.050
It's one of my old phones.
She asked me for it.

57:21.302 --> 57:22.237
Hello.

57:24.273 --> 57:27.677
- It's engaged.
- Kelly. Kelly, can you hear me?

57:30.211 --> 57:32.181
You've got a nerve calling
me after what you did.

57:32.380 --> 57:34.884
Oh, no, wait, Kelly, please,
just listen for a second.

57:34.916 --> 57:36.752
- What, are you using his phone?
- I'm not.

57:37.619 --> 57:40.222
- I'm at the police station.
- Can you just let me explain?

57:40.255 --> 57:44.559
No. I don't have to understand
you and all your shit.

57:44.592 --> 57:46.596
You will just run off
to some bloke.

57:46.628 --> 57:49.097
He tried to steal the car.

57:49.130 --> 57:51.567
No, wait, I chased him.

57:51.599 --> 57:54.304
- I knocked him out with a log.
- I just don't believe you.

57:55.336 --> 57:58.141
Kelly, please. Kelly.

57:58.606 --> 58:00.809
I love you. I love you.

58:08.516 --> 58:13.054
It doesn't mean anything,
you know. Batteries can die.

58:13.088 --> 58:14.791
Something will work out.

58:15.690 --> 58:17.559
Do you think she's capable
of hurting Kelly?

58:19.561 --> 58:22.764
On purpose? I'd say no.

59:13.282 --> 59:16.686
It's nothing to do with me.
It's the sister you want.

59:16.719 --> 59:18.688
I'm an innocent hitchhiker.

59:18.721 --> 59:21.190
Well, she's got a right stack
of charges to answer to.

59:21.222 --> 59:23.025
Don't play the innocent.

59:23.057 --> 59:24.193
I told you,

59:24.226 --> 59:25.760
I was just a man
trying to make my way.

59:25.793 --> 59:27.262
Yeah, really?

59:27.295 --> 59:28.297
Making your way where?

59:34.469 --> 59:35.771
Hello.

59:40.643 --> 59:41.744
Phone.

59:44.913 --> 59:46.583
- Hello?
- You hit him hard.

59:47.148 --> 59:50.118
- Kelly.
- Look, I've left the station.

59:50.152 --> 59:52.420
No. No, I think it's best
that you stay there.

59:52.454 --> 59:55.423
I saw a church towards the edge
of town. I'll meet you there.

59:55.456 --> 59:57.559
- A church?
- What did you say?

59:57.592 --> 59:58.694
Kelly, are you still...?

59:58.893 --> 01:00:00.629
- Hello?
- The phone battery's dying.

01:00:26.989 --> 01:00:29.925
You seem
really easy to talk to.

01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:31.059
Yeah.

01:00:31.927 --> 01:00:34.998
Some people
don't seem to think so.

01:00:43.137 --> 01:00:44.273
Where's the car?

01:00:44.306 --> 01:00:45.840
She could have torched it.

01:00:45.873 --> 01:00:47.942
That would be really
convenient for you, wouldn't it?

01:00:47.976 --> 01:00:49.478
Bet that's
where he stashed it.

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:50.679
Stashed what?

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:52.315
You're coming with us
to find the car.

01:00:53.014 --> 01:00:55.050
We'll start where you camped.

01:01:25.012 --> 01:01:27.449
There's
a sighting at St Mary's church.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.818
Looks like it's the little girl.

01:01:29.851 --> 01:01:33.154
You could double-back. It's on
the other side of the village,

01:01:33.188 --> 01:01:34.891
just off the A31.

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:36.125
This will be interesting.

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:01.350
What's this, an apology?

01:02:01.817 --> 01:02:03.952
- Yes, it is.
- What for?

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:08.291
You know, I haven't
checked out, Michelle.

01:02:09.423 --> 01:02:10.893
I don't wanna give up on us.

01:02:10.925 --> 01:02:14.663
- Maybe if I could just be here...
- You've bought me those before.

01:02:16.431 --> 01:02:17.934
Those dianthus,

01:02:20.135 --> 01:02:22.472
I don't like the smell,
remember?

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.706
Do I need to remind you
once again

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.009
whose favourite flowers
those were, Paul?

01:02:31.012 --> 01:02:32.547
Do you know
that your late wife

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:35.150
has been more present
in our marriage than you have?

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.188
I found this.

01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:44.860
You should read it.

01:02:47.929 --> 01:02:49.965
You might wanna sit down.

01:03:05.614 --> 01:03:09.684
Dear Kelly,
you call me "no mum".

01:03:11.485 --> 01:03:13.888
I hate you for it

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:16.458
but I'm actually
grateful to you, though.

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:19.862
If it wasn't for you, she
wouldn't get mentioned at all.

01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:21.963
I do have a mum.

01:03:21.996 --> 01:03:24.699
She was a big part of me
but that I can't let go of.

01:03:26.835 --> 01:03:30.706
I know dad doesn't want
to face it all, feel it all.

01:03:32.673 --> 01:03:36.045
I think a bit of dad
got buried back then.

01:03:36.244 --> 01:03:38.880
The part that cried
and really laughed,

01:03:40.748 --> 01:03:43.051
the bit that sparkled.

01:03:45.286 --> 01:03:48.056
It's a shame.
He would have liked it.

01:03:50.592 --> 01:03:55.364
It's like he's not been
fully here since. Not properly.

01:03:56.364 --> 01:03:59.668
And now we are going,
it feels like I'm losing you too.

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:04.539
Like going through
the same thing again,

01:04:04.572 --> 01:04:06.741
making the same mistake.

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:14.048
So, before we go, goodbye.

01:04:14.081 --> 01:04:18.186
I'm sorry and I hope
you can forgive us.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:23.425
Your sister, Yakira.

01:07:21.735 --> 01:07:24.005
Kelly, stop, stop, it's over.

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:44.326
It'll be okay.

01:07:48.563 --> 01:07:50.099
I'm handing myself in.

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:52.967
Yakira Lovegrove,
I'm arresting you on...

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:12.221
- He's gone.
- How did he manage that?

01:08:12.253 --> 01:08:14.155
- Who?
- Your mate in the white suit.

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:16.323
- Wait, he's not my mate.
- You sit in the back of the car.

01:08:16.524 --> 01:08:18.827
- He's gone to the car.
- I'll take you there.

01:08:21.962 --> 01:08:23.231
Right.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:31.941
Yakira's not with Kelly.
They don't know where Yakira is.

01:08:32.974 --> 01:08:34.643
Wee Kelly's on her own.

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:38.680
They should never
have split up.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.542
Don't move.

01:09:13.346 --> 01:09:14.884
Go, go, go!

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:22.057
- Have you still got the keys?
- Don't even think about it.

01:09:26.528 --> 01:09:28.596
Think about what?

01:09:56.123 --> 01:09:58.126
I've been thinking that maybe

01:09:58.158 --> 01:10:00.496
we shouldn't go home
straight away.

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:07.402
Right now I think we
should go see your mum.

01:10:07.435 --> 01:10:09.805
You said she's close by.

01:10:09.837 --> 01:10:12.407
Plus, it is important,

01:10:12.439 --> 01:10:14.809
not just for you
but for me as well.

01:10:18.512 --> 01:10:22.016
Not from here.
I don't know the way.

01:10:24.319 --> 01:10:25.487
Take this.

01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:28.224
It's charged.

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:41.170
Okay. It's me.

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:47.141
Yakira,
how can I be of assistance?

01:11:04.125 --> 01:11:09.297
Hello? Yeah, can I get
a call on a taxi, please?

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.533
Right now. Yeah, for now.

01:11:26.014 --> 01:11:31.854
Hey. Are you all right?

01:11:37.658 --> 01:11:40.828
Do you ever
dream the same dream?

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:44.865
A recurring dream? Yeah.

01:11:47.935 --> 01:11:50.038
Do you wanna tell me it?

01:11:52.673 --> 01:11:55.310
I go to the hospital
where my mum was.

01:11:56.944 --> 01:12:01.683
I try to wake her up
but I can't.

01:12:04.118 --> 01:12:07.922
I scream but it's no good.

01:12:11.993 --> 01:12:14.596
The feeling I get
is another thing,

01:12:19.466 --> 01:12:24.172
feeling completely
helpless, totally helpless.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.277
What's your dream?

01:12:33.948 --> 01:12:37.019
You, mum, dad.

01:12:38.619 --> 01:12:39.954
You're at home

01:12:42.023 --> 01:12:47.730
and you're all sad but
you've got bananas like this.

01:12:51.365 --> 01:12:53.801
- Where your mouth is?
- Yeah.

01:12:55.970 --> 01:13:01.009
You're all sad but
the banana's a fake smile.

01:13:03.744 --> 01:13:09.818
It's weird because
it's fake and scary-looking

01:13:11.485 --> 01:13:14.122
but funny at the same time.

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:17.826
I get freaked out.

01:13:19.894 --> 01:13:22.965
I run to the bathroom
to get away from you all

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.170
and in the bathroom
I look in the mirror

01:13:31.805 --> 01:13:33.674
and in the mirror

01:13:36.344 --> 01:13:38.180
I'm like it too.

01:13:43.184 --> 01:13:45.988
That's always when I wake up,

01:13:47.622 --> 01:13:51.059
the moment that I see
that I've got the same smile.

01:13:55.128 --> 01:13:57.632
It's a terrible fear
when I see that.

01:14:00.902 --> 01:14:02.438
It's like dying.

01:15:25.886 --> 01:15:27.523
Mum, this is my sister, Kelly.

01:15:31.391 --> 01:15:33.028
Kelly, this is my mum.

01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:41.936
Sorry I haven't been here.

01:15:58.019 --> 01:15:59.288
I miss you.

01:16:11.565 --> 01:16:12.568
Dad.

01:16:20.574 --> 01:16:22.443
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:17:41.956 --> 01:17:43.592
We'll get through this.

01:18:00.373 --> 01:18:02.309
I didn't have the dream again.

01:18:03.778 --> 01:18:07.949
And there's not much more I can
say than that, really. You know?

01:18:09.216 --> 01:18:11.652
I mean, what can you say
to people?

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:15.990
What can you possibly say
to people about losing...

01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:19.661
How could you...

01:18:22.796 --> 01:18:25.666
How could you
possibly say anything

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:29.003
without the risk
of trivialising everything?

01:18:30.904 --> 01:18:34.009
And if you tried,
where would you even begin?
