WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.702
The future will absolve us
of all our sins.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.837
<i>Oh, I'm going to see Hearn,
believe me.</i>

00:05.872 --> 00:08.373
We got a lot to talk about.
- <i>You set sail in the morning.</i>

00:08.408 --> 00:10.742
- You're not coming with me?
- <i>That's the beauty</i>

00:10.777 --> 00:14.646
<i>of this deal, Slane.
We need each other.</i>

00:14.681 --> 00:16.848
<i>What about Hearn?
What do you think</i>

00:16.883 --> 00:18.984
he's after?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.452
This will track you.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.454
<i>It will let us know
where you're headed.</i>

00:22.489 --> 00:24.456
<i>I don't like the way
he's looking at your girl.</i>

00:24.491 --> 00:26.758
Slaney's sailboat is closing
in on the coast of Colombia.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.660
<i>All we gotta do is wait here
'til it gets back.</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:31.496
We got a body.
One of Hearn's generals.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.465
- They're gonna link us to it.
- Hugo's not gonna be

00:33.500 --> 00:36.468
much of a witness, he's got
a icepick in his head.
- Hey there, party girl!

00:36.503 --> 00:39.604
<i>If you could go anywhere,
anywhere to live,</i>

00:39.639 --> 00:42.074
disappear, start over,
where would you go?

00:42.109 --> 00:46.344
<i>Tropicana hotel is filled with
cops, and your picture is the
centrepiece to whatever sting</i>

00:46.379 --> 00:49.815
<i>they're running there!
- She's a cop.</i>

00:49.850 --> 00:52.251
You gotta go. Now.

00:54.287 --> 00:57.389
I'm telling you,
she's undercover.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.395
Found it.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.768
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

01:11.972 --> 01:13.705
Ramirez, are you sure
she's a cop?

01:13.740 --> 01:16.608
- Uh-huh.
- Then why don't you tell her how you know that.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.777
I saw you at the hotel
with my unit

01:18.812 --> 01:21.280
and what it seems to be
a bunch of gringo DEA.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.617
Drop the gun, please.

01:44.638 --> 01:48.006
OK. OK. We're all friends
here, all right?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.175
Moreno will see you soon.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.982
With all the bodies we found
at that construction site,

01:57.017 --> 01:59.284
we can take Hearn down now
for a long time.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.553
And we get in there,
we take him down quietly

02:01.588 --> 02:03.488
and alive. Move out!

02:03.523 --> 02:07.192
<i>Vamos.</i>

02:09.529 --> 02:13.065
I'm gone, amigo. And I suggest
you do the same, hey?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.671
All right.

02:19.706 --> 02:23.642
I'm gonna make this
real simple.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.378
You have five seconds

02:26.413 --> 02:28.380
to tell me
everything you know

02:28.415 --> 02:32.751
or this death is gonna be
as painful as possible.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.957
Who are you and Brophy
working for, huh?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.559
Police, you idiot!

02:40.594 --> 02:42.661
And there's a lot of us there,
right outside your door.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.764
Oh yeah? If there's
so many cops on the horizon,

02:45.799 --> 02:49.301
then why did you walk in here
by yourself, sweetheart? Huh?

02:51.771 --> 02:53.739
Slaney lead you here?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.642
LOOK AT ME!

02:57.677 --> 03:00.645
I want you to think
very carefully

03:00.680 --> 03:02.914
about how you're gonna
answer this question.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.587
Is Slaney in on this?

03:33.546 --> 03:36.615
- KC?
- Don't fucking move.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.584
Where were we, huh?

03:45.692 --> 03:48.560
♪ Come on the rising wind ♪

03:48.595 --> 03:52.230
♪ We're going up
around the bend ♪

03:52.265 --> 03:54.633
♪ Yeah ♪

03:54.668 --> 03:56.801
Moreno.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.037
David Slaney.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.740
Espresso?

04:01.775 --> 04:04.710
I wouldn't say no.

04:09.282 --> 04:12.851
Uh, my boat has 500 grand

04:12.886 --> 04:14.653
worth of your product.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.922
All I gotta do is just,
I give you this cash

04:17.957 --> 04:21.126
and then, me and my people,
we can be on our way.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.495
Oh, you don't wish
to sample first?

04:24.764 --> 04:27.699
- No.
- No?

04:27.734 --> 04:30.201
No? And I'm supposed

04:30.236 --> 04:32.437
to trust a man who does not
wish to sample first.

04:32.472 --> 04:36.675
If I sample, maybe you're not
gonna like me so much anymore.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.078
Who "say" I like you?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.617
That... joke.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.986
OK, business.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.988
You know,

04:50.023 --> 04:52.290
I miss my wife.

04:52.325 --> 04:55.293
I really do.
- Carter, why is today the day

04:55.328 --> 04:58.129
you decide to be the least sober
person in the world?

04:58.164 --> 05:01.066
I am done with all of this.
- Oh no!

05:01.101 --> 05:03.835
I'm serious.
The first port we pass,

05:03.870 --> 05:05.970
I'm gone.
- You're just here

05:06.005 --> 05:08.306
to sail this ship to Cancun,

05:08.341 --> 05:10.508
and then I don't give a shit
what you do.

05:10.543 --> 05:11.776
What?

05:11.811 --> 05:14.212
Slaney can sail the boat back;
you don't need me.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.382
- You don't understand.
- Cyril, just get it together.

05:17.417 --> 05:20.185
Once you cross this line,
there's no coming back, right?

05:20.220 --> 05:22.487
And I don't know
why I care,

05:22.522 --> 05:25.857
because he stole you from me.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.859
What are you talking about?

05:27.894 --> 05:30.128
Slaney's not coming back.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.664
You understand?

05:34.901 --> 05:36.601
<i>Amigo,</i>

05:36.636 --> 05:38.103
you are mistaken.

05:38.138 --> 05:42.407
It is $450,000
worth of product.

05:44.244 --> 05:47.812
All due respect...

05:47.847 --> 05:51.083
are you trying
to lowball me here?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.786
OK. One second, sir.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.554
Anna Maria,

05:56.589 --> 05:59.391
bring Mr. Slaney
a good biscuit.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.430
You have an agreement
with my friend Hearn.

06:05.465 --> 06:08.967
I... I expect you to honour
that agreement now.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.368
<i>Si, si, si, si.</i>

06:10.403 --> 06:13.338
Your friend and I,
we did have an agreement,

06:13.373 --> 06:16.574
and I do intend
to honour it.

06:16.609 --> 06:19.778
450 for <i>los drogas</i>

06:19.813 --> 06:22.213
and 50k

06:22.248 --> 06:24.282
to cut your head off.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.453
I'm sorry, Roy.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.123
Put the gun down.

06:32.158 --> 06:35.126
Put the gun down!

06:35.161 --> 06:37.595
Don't do it.
Don't listen to him.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.098
Put. The gun. Down.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.641
Have a seat.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.478
SIT DOWN!

06:57.717 --> 07:00.518
You can just walk out of here,
you know?

07:00.553 --> 07:03.087
Oh, I've got your permission
for that, do I? Thanks.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.590
We're gonna find you eventually.

07:18.404 --> 07:22.007
<i>Ohh.</i>

07:23.743 --> 07:25.810
OK.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.812
OK, come on.

07:27.847 --> 07:31.583
Hey. Let her go.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.140
Because he knew
that Slaney was gonna

07:56.175 --> 07:59.143
come for him eventually.
So Hearn hired

07:59.178 --> 08:01.412
Lopez and Gopez

08:01.447 --> 08:03.882
and all the Sanchezes
to kill him.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.554
What have
you got to say?

08:09.589 --> 08:13.458
Ha! I'm fronting the cash
for my own hit.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.896
You bet on the wrong horse.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.797

- Hearn's poetic,

08:19.832 --> 08:22.800

08:22.835 --> 08:24.702
I didn't want this,

09:33.139 --> 09:35.340
You got a cigarette?

09:43.149 --> 09:46.017
Anything?

09:47.353 --> 09:50.722
No, I can't get anything
out of those doctors, but, uh,

09:50.757 --> 09:52.590
I don't speak Spanish.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.727
- She's hanging in though?
- Yeah, for now,

09:55.762 --> 09:57.762
she seems to be.

10:00.299 --> 10:03.134
The signal
from the tracking device,

10:03.169 --> 10:04.402
it's gone.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.138
Lost it somewhere
around Colombia.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.140
There's a massive storm
heading right toward

10:09.175 --> 10:13.277
their last known location.
It's bad.

10:13.312 --> 10:16.614
I'm sorry, Kyle.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.817
Don't be sorry to me.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.754
Williams is in there
hanging by a thread,

10:22.789 --> 10:24.789
and it's your fault.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.760
I know it's my fault.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.662
Are you drinking?

10:32.331 --> 10:34.599
We get Hearn; we'll turn
this whole thing around.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.734
We can turn it right around
so we gotta get Hearn.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.604
We have to get Hearn.
- It's over.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.406
You lost.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.642
You lost an escaped convict.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.344
You lost a drug lord.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.279
You've messed this thing up
right from the start.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.782
The DEA's already
packing up to leave.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.251
No, I can't. Can't let Hearn

10:53.286 --> 10:55.186
get away with this.
Not now. Especially not now.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.388
You're suspended

10:57.423 --> 10:59.157
'til I see

10:59.192 --> 11:01.326
if I can actually fire you.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.364
Go home, Roy.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.468
I need a cigarette.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.172
I'm sorry.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.542
I really am.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.044
Ah, forget it, Kyle.
Go home, Kyle.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.513
It's all fine. It's fine.
It's fine. It's good.

11:22.548 --> 11:25.350
Just gotta go. It's all fine.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.787
Fine. Haha! Fine, fine.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.703
Ugh!

11:49.942 --> 11:52.644
Hey.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.387
Oh, please,
please, please.

12:03.422 --> 12:05.657
Tell me you got cigarettes.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.728
Yeah, I know it's really wrong

12:10.763 --> 12:12.730
to go through a woman's handbag.

12:12.765 --> 12:15.066
Oh, bingo!

12:21.607 --> 12:24.709
I thought I was having
a heart attack.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.978
Kind of hilarious
that you wake up and you find me

12:27.013 --> 12:29.747
lying dead next to you
on the floor.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.722
I need to tell you something.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.525
If you don't...

12:40.560 --> 12:42.493
pull through this,
it's my fault,

12:42.528 --> 12:45.163
and O'Neill was right.
I know what you would say,

12:45.198 --> 12:47.499
but it is. It's my fault.
It is 'cause...

12:48.968 --> 12:51.169
...I dragged you into this.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.538
I misled you, I lied to you,

12:53.573 --> 12:56.241
I made you vulnerable,
and I don't...

12:58.110 --> 13:01.312
I'm not at all sure
I got the strength

13:01.347 --> 13:04.048
to deal with the enormity
of that.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.658
<i>You know what you said about
Joy, about my daughter,
how she could be</i>

13:13.693 --> 13:16.060
out there,
she could be

13:16.095 --> 13:18.296
out there living?

13:19.565 --> 13:23.101
Well, she isn't,
'cause she's dead.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.737
Now I know this.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.674
I have known this

13:29.709 --> 13:31.475
for a long time.

13:31.510 --> 13:34.779
<i>I was called
to the morgue one night.</i>

13:34.814 --> 13:36.781
<i>They'd found a young girl.
She'd been</i>

13:36.816 --> 13:40.651
<i>killed and dumped
by whoever, and...</i>

13:40.686 --> 13:43.287
<i>and wherever it is they dragged
her body out of...</i>

13:43.322 --> 13:46.157
<i>It was basically unrecognizable.</i>

13:47.393 --> 13:49.227
<i>I was never really</i>

13:49.262 --> 13:52.163
there for them.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.066
<i>For her, for my wife.</i>

13:58.371 --> 14:01.406
<i>Minus the hideous tattoo of course.</i>

14:03.676 --> 14:05.610
That's her.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.278
I'm sorry.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.582
<i>When she disappeared,
I just dug down deeper</i>

14:11.617 --> 14:14.252
<i>into the job.
I just shut myself off.</i>

14:14.287 --> 14:16.254
<i>I should have been out
to try and find her,</i>

14:16.289 --> 14:20.791
<i>find my little girl, but...</i>
AAAAH!

14:20.826 --> 14:23.228
...it was too late.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.401
It's not her.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.271
- Hey, Patterson, I--
- It's not my daughter.

14:37.376 --> 14:41.279
I didn't come, all right?
You just tell me. You say
the words right now:

14:41.314 --> 14:43.814
"It's not my daughter!
It's not Joy!"

14:43.849 --> 14:46.384
It's not.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.653
OK, it's not...
it's not Joy.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.690
<i>So I made a choice. I don't
know whether it was the booze</i>

14:52.725 --> 14:54.992
<i>or the pills,
but I had made a decision</i>

14:55.027 --> 14:57.228
<i>that... she wasn't dead.</i>

14:57.263 --> 14:59.230
<i>She was doing exactly
what you said.</i>

14:59.265 --> 15:02.066
<i>She was out there.
She was reinventing herself.</i>

15:02.101 --> 15:04.469
<i>She was living life
to the top.</i>

15:06.672 --> 15:10.174
And it was really simple.
It was like I'd found her.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.610
And I wasn't about
to let her go. I was not ready.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.613
I wasn't ready.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.615
I wasn't ready to admit
that I'd failed.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.650
I wasn't ready to look my wife
in the eye and say

15:19.685 --> 15:22.153
that I'd... I'd lost...
I'd lost...

15:23.889 --> 15:26.658
I wasn't ready
for any of that.

15:28.861 --> 15:32.563
And I'm not ready

15:32.598 --> 15:34.732
to lose you, so you better
just get with my program.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.768
You better wake up.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.560
<i>Police, idiot.</i>

16:02.595 --> 16:05.262
<i>And there's a lot of us there,
right outside your door.</i>

16:05.297 --> 16:07.331
<i>Oh yeah? If there's
so many cops on the...</i>

16:09.802 --> 16:11.769
<i>I'm gone, amigo,
and I suggest you do the...</i>

16:11.804 --> 16:14.238
<i>Ramirez, are you sure</i>

16:14.273 --> 16:18.109
<i>she's a cop? Then why
don't you tell her how...</i>

16:18.144 --> 16:20.644
<i>Ramirez, are you sure
she's a cop?</i>

16:20.679 --> 16:24.215
Ramirez, the <i>federale.</i>

16:26.118 --> 16:28.987
I'm gonna go get Hearn.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.523
It's a good deal.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.325
You bought his life.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.028
Yeah, he'll owe me.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.997
You know, my men
wanted to keep you,

16:40.032 --> 16:42.299
kill your Slaney.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.836
Thank you for not doing that.

16:45.871 --> 16:49.774
Lucky I'm in charge.

16:56.315 --> 16:59.984
You, both of you
should relax tonight.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.955
Huh? You sleep here
as our guest.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.258
So please...

17:07.293 --> 17:09.226
have another drink.

17:09.261 --> 17:12.863
- Oh no. I... I don't think I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:12.898 --> 17:16.467
I've had too much.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.502
OK.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.010
Get the feeling that
if we sleep here tonight,

17:26.045 --> 17:28.779
we don't wake up?
- Yeah.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.048
He'll be passing out soon.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.983
What did you do to him?

17:33.018 --> 17:35.019
One of them had a pharmacy
in their bag.

17:35.054 --> 17:39.123
Tranquilizers, the works.
They'll be out for a while.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.661
We gotta get
those diamonds back.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.797
When this is over,

17:46.832 --> 17:48.599
they might be
all we have.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.968
You've got some scheme
happening inside that head

17:51.003 --> 17:53.637
of yours, don't you?

17:53.672 --> 17:55.539
Me too.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.149
Remind me
never to mess with you.

18:05.184 --> 18:07.452
Never mess with me.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.123
Ah... Ah.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.692
Let's go.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.760
Raise the anchor.
Get the main sail. I'll get

18:16.795 --> 18:18.963
the engine, get us a head start.
- Slaney.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.898
Baby.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.367
What are you doing?

18:25.671 --> 18:28.672
She called me baby.

18:28.707 --> 18:31.242
That's nice.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.644
What's your big move
here, Carter?

18:33.679 --> 18:36.046
Um...

18:36.081 --> 18:38.048
I am the failsafe,

18:38.083 --> 18:40.651
the backup

18:40.686 --> 18:42.453
in case you were able

18:42.488 --> 18:44.889
to weasel your way out
with the Colombians.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.891
That was Hearn's words.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.326
So you're
his executioner now?

18:49.361 --> 18:51.962
Hearn, what to do,
it was either you or him.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.331
Any idiot could see that, Slane.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.934
So I'm just making
the first move.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.736
This does NOT

18:58.771 --> 19:01.505
have to play out
how Hearn wants, all right?

19:01.540 --> 19:05.109
We can make our own decisions!
- I make my own decisions,

19:05.144 --> 19:07.511
except my loyalty
is to Hearn,

19:07.546 --> 19:10.481
not to you,
and he needs you gone.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.850
For good this time.
- Cyril, why don't we

19:12.885 --> 19:15.419
sit down--
- DON'T!

19:15.454 --> 19:18.022
THIS IS REAL, SLANEY!
- We'll just have, we'll have

19:18.057 --> 19:21.392
a drink, OK? We'll sit down.
We'll have a drink.
We'll have a chat.

19:21.427 --> 19:25.329
What do you say?
Come on, buddy. Come on.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.267
You know...

19:31.270 --> 19:34.772
...I could have loved her.
- You are not a killer,

19:34.807 --> 19:36.907
Carter. You're not.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.176
What's wrong with me?

19:39.211 --> 19:41.178
She was so special.

19:45.217 --> 19:48.719
Do not let Hearn
push you to this.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.155
Slaney, you have no idea
where I've been pushed...

19:53.225 --> 19:55.859
...how hard Hearn and I fought.
And then you stroll in

19:55.894 --> 19:58.029
to take my place?!

20:19.385 --> 20:23.654
Hey, watch out!

20:26.725 --> 20:28.459
We have to go.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.164
Hmm...

20:34.199 --> 20:35.766
The serum.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.035
Get the sails up.
If we sail into it,

20:38.070 --> 20:41.339
we'll... we'll lose them.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.356
OK, uh, with everything
tied down to a float,

20:59.391 --> 21:01.725
all we gotta do is just wait

21:01.760 --> 21:04.061
for it to hit us.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.031
- You saved my life.
- Yeah.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.571
Come here.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.542
I said, Come here.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.292
Are you OK?

22:08.327 --> 22:11.195
I can't get his face
out of my mind.

22:12.998 --> 22:16.467
His eyes and the way
he looked at me.

22:19.271 --> 22:22.073
You want to do this
to yourself?

22:23.409 --> 22:25.576
I took a man's life.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.980
You did what you had to.
You made the only choice

22:30.015 --> 22:33.317
you could.
One I'm very grateful for.

22:35.087 --> 22:38.222
That doesn't
make it any easier.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.524
I can't just turn it off,

22:40.559 --> 22:42.459
how that feels,

22:42.494 --> 22:44.261
what I did.

22:44.296 --> 22:47.298
My first night inside...

22:48.901 --> 22:51.202
...it's all starting to sink in.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.905
That the whole thing's real.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.841
I'm a pot smuggler;
I'm in there with murderers

22:57.876 --> 22:59.977
and rapists and...

23:00.012 --> 23:01.979
and worse, and I look around

23:02.014 --> 23:04.215
at these guys,
and I'm thinking...

23:05.984 --> 23:07.651
..."There are the people
I'm gonna spend

23:07.686 --> 23:11.455
the next 15 years
of my life with."

23:12.991 --> 23:15.593
So, my first night...

23:17.529 --> 23:19.730
...I made a pact with myself.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.568
Anyone comes near me
comes at me.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.672
I'm gonna do what I gotta do
to survive.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.744
And yeah...

23:35.681 --> 23:39.049
...things happened.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.385
They happen

23:41.420 --> 23:45.088
when we don't have the luxury
to control things.

23:45.123 --> 23:47.458
They just happen.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.163
But you got...

23:53.198 --> 23:55.532
you gotta keep going.

23:55.567 --> 23:59.069
And you gotta keep
moving forward.

24:01.773 --> 24:05.109
If you didn't do what you did
last night, I'd be dead.

24:07.579 --> 24:10.080
We're in this together.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.051
You and me.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.259
Are we?

24:42.514 --> 24:46.216
I need to talk to Hearn.
I think you want to help me,

24:46.251 --> 24:48.385
so how about you put that gun
on the trunk there.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.287
You're making a big mistake.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.289
No, I don't think so.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.525
See, Hearn shot
my partner in the back

24:54.560 --> 24:56.793
'cause you told him
she was a cop.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.496
What do you mean? I'll take
my chances with my own people.

24:59.531 --> 25:01.331
Well, that's not
really an option.

25:01.366 --> 25:04.535
You're wasting time. Time is
not something I have much of.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.336
So tell me where he is

25:06.371 --> 25:09.573
and tell me what's going on
with this dead body.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.477
Time for me
to get a promotion,

25:13.512 --> 25:16.947
and my boss, Carillo,
was standing in my way.

25:16.982 --> 25:19.183
Uh-huh?

25:32.698 --> 25:36.066
Seems, uh,
you got the sail up.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.035
It was mostly minor damage.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.970
I checked it all out.

25:40.005 --> 25:41.572
We're good.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.977
I, uh, found this.

25:47.012 --> 25:50.113
It's turned off.

25:50.148 --> 25:52.149
Are you working for the DEA?

25:54.019 --> 25:55.753
Am I part of that?

25:57.489 --> 25:58.322
No.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.491
Are they coming for me?

26:01.960 --> 26:04.595
It has nothing to do with you.

26:04.630 --> 26:06.063
Ha.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.098
I can't say

26:08.133 --> 26:11.268
that I was expecting
any of this. You, us.

26:13.105 --> 26:17.040
Well, I guess
I know what your big play
was this whole time.

26:17.075 --> 26:20.043
I am sorry.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.112
I'm sorry

26:22.147 --> 26:24.181
that I didn't tell you,
but both of us...

26:24.216 --> 26:27.584
both of us were keeping
things from each other,

26:27.619 --> 26:29.686
from everybody else.

26:29.721 --> 26:33.190
But I... I don't...

26:33.225 --> 26:35.492
I don't want it
to be that way anymore.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.329
So you're setting Hearn up?

26:39.998 --> 26:42.399
The cops think I am.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.635
OK.

26:44.670 --> 26:48.138
And I'm gonna need you.
I'm asking you...

26:49.808 --> 26:52.909
...to take a leap of faith
with me here.

26:52.944 --> 26:56.447
So this trust, this leap
that you're asking for...

26:58.150 --> 26:59.783
...it's more than a leap for me,

26:59.818 --> 27:02.986
you know? Just tell me
you understand.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.956
I understand.
I really understand.

27:12.931 --> 27:14.632
OK then.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.869
The storm took us a long way,
and my guess is

27:18.904 --> 27:22.439
that it's Mexico.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.410
Well, we better get moving.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.645
Slaney call in
on the number.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.148
He said he has your product
and your diamonds on top.

27:31.183 --> 27:34.017
He's on his way here now.
- And you're sure

27:34.052 --> 27:36.286
it's safe for me to be
out in the open like this?

27:36.321 --> 27:38.488
I'm in charge now.

27:38.523 --> 27:41.625
Carillo is out of the picture,
OK? Any evidence we had on you,

27:41.660 --> 27:44.194
on the bodies that we found
on the construction site,

27:44.229 --> 27:46.363
they have, uh...

27:46.398 --> 27:49.433
mysteriously disappeared.
- Good.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.368
My department
is ceasing to cooperate

27:51.403 --> 27:53.437
with the DEA and the RCMP.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.439
They already packed up
all their toys and went home.

27:55.474 --> 27:59.376
Heh! Oh, oh,
and that other cop, uh...

27:59.411 --> 28:01.445
Roughy?
- Yeah, Brophy.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.780
Yeah. He's no longer
gonna be a problem.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.782
Nobody can touch you.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.984
OK.

28:33.945 --> 28:36.080
Ugh!

28:54.566 --> 28:57.201
And I thought
you left with the others.

28:59.004 --> 29:01.171
What the hell
are you doing out of bed?

29:01.206 --> 29:03.173
Doctors cleared me,
said I could go.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.509
And when did you
pick up Spanish?

29:05.544 --> 29:07.644
My shoulder's
not gonna be right

29:07.679 --> 29:10.147
for a while,
but how are you?

29:10.182 --> 29:12.516
I had a little dust-up,
but I'm still here.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.951
The question is where the hell
is everyone else?

29:14.986 --> 29:18.188
Your boss left
a few hours ago.
His clean-up crew is coming back

29:18.223 --> 29:20.791
to pick up this gear.
My boss left yesterday.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.593
And I've just been in here
looking for Lieutenant Carillo

29:23.628 --> 29:25.562
so I can tell him
about his man, Ramirez.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.331
Unfortunately, I think
he knows 'cause Ramirez

29:28.366 --> 29:30.534
got to him and his body's
lying in Hearn's pit.

29:35.907 --> 29:37.908
Hey!

29:37.943 --> 29:39.976
We're all set?

29:40.011 --> 29:42.246
- Is this our ride?
- Yeah.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.954
What are you doing?

29:50.989 --> 29:53.023
You're not coming with me.

29:53.058 --> 29:55.325
Slane, I'm coming.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.328
Crew up the boat,
take the diamonds, and get

29:58.363 --> 30:01.164
as far away from here
as possible.

30:01.199 --> 30:03.967
Hearn will kill you.

30:04.002 --> 30:06.870
Well, there's some optimism.

30:06.905 --> 30:10.073
You think you can do this
without me, you're wrong!

30:11.476 --> 30:15.212
Right now, nobody knows that
you're involved in any of this.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.180
And I gotta
take Hearn down

30:17.215 --> 30:20.183
by myself.
- Who's gonna have your back?

30:20.218 --> 30:21.885
Just promise me

30:21.920 --> 30:26.089
that wherever you go,
you'll let me know somehow.

30:34.266 --> 30:38.134
I better see you again, David.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.370
You will.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.151
They're on land?

30:55.186 --> 30:59.022
Slaney's sending the signal
he's come back here to Cancun.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.525
Back to Hearn's?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.460
Slaney.

31:48.974 --> 31:51.875
I'd offer you
a drink, but...

31:51.910 --> 31:53.944
We're done having drinks.

31:53.979 --> 31:57.180
And what happened to Carter?

31:58.683 --> 32:01.685
What was supposed
to happen to me.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.454
I should have
known, but...

32:05.657 --> 32:08.992
...but honestly, I never thought
you'd go that far.

32:12.297 --> 32:14.764
Did you get my message?

32:14.799 --> 32:17.167
Oh, the diamonds? Yeah.

32:17.202 --> 32:20.203
Haha! That was a nice touch.

32:22.073 --> 32:24.307
Where are they
by the way?

32:24.342 --> 32:26.509
Oh, I'm gonna hold onto 'em

32:26.544 --> 32:29.045
until I get my end
of this deal.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.781
But at least,

32:31.816 --> 32:33.383
you got my cocaine, right?

32:33.418 --> 32:35.619
It's all there.

32:41.493 --> 32:44.461
You really want
to finish this?

32:44.496 --> 32:46.596
Why don't we just do
the deal

32:46.631 --> 32:48.865
and then we never have to see
each other ever again.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.942
Ugh!

33:05.817 --> 33:08.084
- ♪ No time left for you ♪
- Help me.

33:08.119 --> 33:10.487

33:47.559 --> 33:50.660
We were never much
for mass, but...

33:50.695 --> 33:53.930
look at us now, huh?

33:58.903 --> 34:01.771
I never understood
how you could

34:01.806 --> 34:04.774
do the service with...

34:04.809 --> 34:07.744
Father, uh...

34:09.814 --> 34:12.348
- Barf.
- Barf. Father Barf.

34:12.383 --> 34:14.518
That's what you used
to call him because...

34:16.321 --> 34:18.421
...every time you looked at him,

34:18.456 --> 34:20.991
he made you want to barf.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.394
I did a couple of times.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.699
The whiff of him...
- Haha! Oh, he had

34:29.734 --> 34:32.135
a hum that's for sure.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.212
No.

34:42.247 --> 34:44.714
Always the altar boy.

34:47.519 --> 34:51.121
You know, I never understood
why you hung out with me.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.461
I had to hang out
with someone.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.900
You knew
who I was,

35:03.935 --> 35:06.536
what I was all along.

35:09.274 --> 35:12.542
Not until very, very recently.

35:21.753 --> 35:24.421
You know why I left you
on that boat?

35:26.291 --> 35:29.025
I did leave you,
you were very right about that.

35:31.829 --> 35:33.830
I could have warned you,
I could have said something,

35:33.865 --> 35:37.634
but no, I left you there holding
the bag, so I could get away.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.406
I did it

35:43.441 --> 35:46.809
because I knew
that you would be OK.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.411
Haha!

35:51.082 --> 35:53.082
That is fresh, that is.
- No.

35:53.117 --> 35:55.418
No, no, no.
I don't mean it like that.

35:55.453 --> 35:58.488
I knew that on the inside,
you'd make the most of it.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.890
You would read.
You'd meet people. You'd get

36:00.925 --> 36:02.959
tougher and harder,

36:02.994 --> 36:07.430
and you would come out
the same or different,

36:07.465 --> 36:09.566
but you...

36:09.601 --> 36:13.236
you, David Slaney,
you would be OK.

36:14.772 --> 36:16.573
I'd be dead.

36:16.608 --> 36:20.109
I'd have come out
an absolute monster.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.779
Turns out
it didn't take prison, Hearn,

36:22.814 --> 36:25.015
to make you a monster.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.655
I suppose Jennifer

36:32.690 --> 36:34.991
told you?

36:36.995 --> 36:38.695
Yeah.

36:38.730 --> 36:42.932
I was shit to you

36:42.967 --> 36:46.436
and her and everyone.

36:51.175 --> 36:54.644
And look at me now. Haha!

36:54.679 --> 36:57.880
I'm even worse.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.693
You and me...

37:11.763 --> 37:14.130
...we had a real shot, right?

37:19.337 --> 37:21.638
Right?

37:23.341 --> 37:27.110
Nothing you can say
changes what happens next.

37:30.815 --> 37:32.315
Yeah.

37:37.588 --> 37:40.423
You should do it.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.161
I should. I should.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.664
Oh, God,
you have every reason.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.634
I do.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.388
I should have known.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.493
You always gotta be
the better man.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.233
You're the only friend
I ever had.

38:27.338 --> 38:30.373
Ugh! Oh! No!

38:30.408 --> 38:31.908
No!

38:31.943 --> 38:34.144
Ride's over, fellas.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.724
Slaney, you got a visitor.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.268
Slaney.

39:07.044 --> 39:09.245
Nice to see you again.

39:10.581 --> 39:12.915
Crown prosecutor
the judge, everyone;

39:12.950 --> 39:14.851
they all know you were working
with me and what you did.

39:14.886 --> 39:18.287
Did you tell them that
you broke me out of this prison?

39:18.322 --> 39:21.057
Nah, I left
certain minor details out.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.059
Bottom line is you're free.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.595
Smart work on that tracker
by the way.

39:25.630 --> 39:28.431
I guess I'm just lucky
you were there to see it.

39:28.466 --> 39:32.302
You know about this?
Who she really was?

39:35.907 --> 39:38.141
It was Lisa Ada Nicholson.

39:38.176 --> 39:41.110
She was born in Nebraska
and for the last 10 years or so,

39:41.145 --> 39:44.747
she made a living bilking
old white guys out of
their life savings.

39:44.782 --> 39:48.951
You're a little young
for her usual mark.

39:48.986 --> 39:51.087
Are you even aware
of what happened

39:51.122 --> 39:53.089
when I took
both of you down?

39:53.124 --> 39:56.225
What are you talking about?

39:56.260 --> 39:59.328

40:19.083 --> 40:21.284
with 24 kilos of sugar.

40:23.988 --> 40:25.755
She stashed
the real cocaine,

40:25.790 --> 40:28.491

she sailed off into the morning</i>

40:28.526 --> 40:31.527

40:31.562 --> 40:35.465

40:35.500 --> 40:37.700

Did she make contact?

41:17.308 --> 41:19.509
Even if she did,
I couldn't tell you.

41:21.212 --> 41:24.047
But I'll be honest,
I had no idea about any of this.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.521
Well...

41:31.556 --> 41:35.458
