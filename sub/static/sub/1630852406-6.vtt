WEBVTT

00:08.049 --> 00:11.011
<i>How does it feel to be a part</i>
<i>of the mission on Balhae Station?</i>

00:13.263 --> 00:15.140
I don't know. I'm not sure.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.018
It's great.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.187
<i>What was the training like?</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:23.523
Good.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.985
<i>Isn't it tough?</i>

00:27.068 --> 00:27.986
No.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.282
<i>Do you stay in touch with your family?</i>

00:33.575 --> 00:35.368
I feel more comfortable alone.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.457
5TH PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION

00:42.417 --> 00:44.419
<i>How do you feel today?</i>

00:44.502 --> 00:45.462
Good.

00:48.006 --> 00:51.718
<i>Don't you think you might regret</i>
<i>taking part in this mission?</i>

00:53.386 --> 00:54.262
No.

00:56.556 --> 01:00.268
<i>What kind of thoughts help you</i>
<i>bear through a tough situation?</i>

01:00.977 --> 01:02.604
I don't think about anything.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.732
<i>What about your family?</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:11.237
My parents passed away when I was young,

01:11.321 --> 01:14.074
and my older sister died
in an accident five years ago.

01:16.701 --> 01:19.996
<i>What does your older sister mean to you?</i>

01:23.416 --> 01:24.417
I'm not sure.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.462
I think I relied on her a lot
when I was a kid.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.137
10TH PSYCHOTHERAPY SESSION

01:36.221 --> 01:38.473
<i>Why did your older sister leave?</i>

01:40.975 --> 01:42.102
I don't know.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.355
But I'm sure she had a reason.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.444
<i>What does your older sister mean to you?</i>

03:26.539 --> 03:30.835
KEY TO SALVATION

05:52.769 --> 05:54.062
How are the capsules?

05:54.145 --> 05:57.106
The internal temperature is unstable,
so I'll have to see.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.151
Let's try not to move these around

06:00.651 --> 06:02.362
until we transfer them outside.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.367
What were you thinking?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.285
What?

06:09.369 --> 06:12.038
Did you think she wouldn't attack us
if you gave her the lunar water?

06:12.997 --> 06:14.040
I only

06:15.166 --> 06:16.667
wanted to show her

06:17.794 --> 06:19.712
that I won't hurt her.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.507
That I'm not trying
to take the capsule from her.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.051
I thought she'd feel that too.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.014
If you expose yourself to danger,
you burden the whole team.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.475
You saw her.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.896
You saw how
the lunar water reacts with her.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.982
We all saw it.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.194
Yes, her cheek opened and closed.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.696
And her wounds were healed in an instant.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.282
How is that possible?

06:49.909 --> 06:53.287
Dr. Song, do you have any idea
what kind of being she may be?

06:55.540 --> 06:56.666
I don't know.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.127
But what I do know is

07:00.336 --> 07:02.547
the lunar water won't kill her.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.591
He'll be fine.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.385
His cut isn't too deep.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.345
Anyway, what was that girl?

07:09.429 --> 07:12.056
Did the lunar water bring
some kind of change to her body?

07:13.766 --> 07:17.478
It seemed like her body
adapted to the lunar water.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.521
Adapted?

07:18.604 --> 07:20.440
She didn't simply adapt to it.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.569
Her physical ability… and the speed
of recovery showed it's more than that.

07:25.319 --> 07:28.406
She may have been born
with antibodies for it,

07:28.489 --> 07:30.908
or it may be
a special case of genetic mutation

07:30.992 --> 07:32.994
caused by different environmental factors.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.666
What we do know is she's a danger to us.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.004
We should resume the search
and catch her even if we must kill--

07:43.087 --> 07:44.547
No, we can't kill her.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.760
We need to kill her or whatever
to put an end to this and go home.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.179
We can't kill her.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.601
She may be the only key
to the secret of the lunar water.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.899
She might just be everyone's hope.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.735
This is just…

08:13.868 --> 08:15.161
You're a bit feverish.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.580
It might be the wrong antibiotics.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.209
There's nothing we can use here,
so I'll check another lab.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.543
I'll find something.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.175
Are you all right?

08:29.258 --> 08:30.426
I'm okay, sir.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.637
I'm sorry to make you worried.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.722
Don't mind the mission.
Look after yourself.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.049
<i>Hello, Captain Han.</i>

09:10.633 --> 09:12.635
<i>I heard the situation isn't looking great.</i>

09:12.718 --> 09:13.886
<i>Are you all right?</i>

09:15.137 --> 09:17.014
I'd like to ask you a question.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.642
Are you there alone?

09:20.476 --> 09:22.979
<i>Yes, this is a secure channel.</i>
<i>Please go ahead.</i>

09:24.438 --> 09:26.649
How much do you know
about this series of events?

09:30.319 --> 09:33.447
<i>It was Director Choi's decision</i>
<i>to shut down Balhae Station.</i>

09:33.531 --> 09:36.534
<i>There are some who question that decision.</i>

09:38.286 --> 09:39.537
What about you?

09:42.290 --> 09:45.626
Is there anything else
I should know regarding Balhae Station?

09:47.753 --> 09:51.215
<i>You're the one…</i>
<i>who's there at the station now.</i>

09:51.299 --> 09:52.675
What do you mean?

09:52.758 --> 09:55.344
<i>Please have a talk with Dr. Song.</i>

09:55.970 --> 09:57.346
<i>The truth lies there,</i>

09:58.598 --> 09:59.557
<i>not here.</i>

10:19.368 --> 10:24.832
<i>Current outdoor temperature, 23 degrees.</i>
<i>Humidity, 36 percent.</i>

10:24.915 --> 10:27.251
-<i>Air quality is at Level D.</i>
-Doctor.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.919
Did you say Hajin is gone?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.380
We just found her.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.716
What happened?

10:33.799 --> 10:35.051
I'm not sure.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.511
She must've had a bad dream.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.182
She kept looking for her dad
and barely managed to fall asleep.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.230
Stop!

11:30.314 --> 11:31.190
I said stop!

11:32.108 --> 11:32.942
Stop!

11:34.026 --> 11:35.319
I'm warning you!

11:43.494 --> 11:46.205
<i>Stand back.</i>

11:46.288 --> 11:49.583
<i>This is a warning.</i>
<i>Return to your original places.</i>

11:50.251 --> 11:52.503
<i>We will fire if you do not stand back.</i>

11:52.586 --> 11:53.462
<i>Stand back.</i>

11:55.214 --> 11:57.633
Mom…

11:58.175 --> 12:00.553
Mom…

12:01.137 --> 12:03.639
I suddenly remember
the time I went to a swimming pool.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.643
I got on a slide
and fell right into the water.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.645
It was so damn fun.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.022
Right?

12:12.523 --> 12:14.066
You've done that, haven't you?

12:17.236 --> 12:19.029
If this mission is a success,

12:20.156 --> 12:22.783
we could see a pool once again.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.719
<i>We'll lure her out and capture her alive.</i>

12:44.889 --> 12:46.432
Map of the ventilation shafts.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.850
Show INP-07.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.190
The shaft INP-07 leads
to many key facilities in the station.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.903
<i>If we lure her</i>
<i>with this lunar water capsule</i>

12:58.986 --> 13:01.155
<i>and block off this intersection of INP-07…</i>

13:03.866 --> 13:04.867
right here,

13:05.868 --> 13:09.121
<i>she'll have to come out through the vent</i>
<i>in the hallway of the machine room.</i>

13:10.456 --> 13:12.708
Then we'll shut both ends of the hallway.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.543
<i>Like hare coursing.</i>

13:15.044 --> 13:18.214
So we want to chase her down
and trap her. But there's a problem.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.423
That hare can

13:20.216 --> 13:22.676
easily rip a person to pieces.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.637
He's right.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.723
Even if we get lucky
and trap her in the hallway,

13:27.807 --> 13:31.185
it's still too dangerous
to subdue her and catch her alive.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.024
That's why we need Dr. Song.

14:11.809 --> 14:12.685
Captain.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.021
We can't use guns.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.567
Please don't provoke her
as long as we must

14:20.568 --> 14:21.902
until I calm her down.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.697
That's my decision to make on the scene.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.221
Even within the SAA,

14:49.763 --> 14:52.725
some people were against
moving the lunar water to Earth.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.770
If we carry something back
without confirming its safety,

14:56.854 --> 14:58.856
it could pose a danger for everyone.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.858
But Director Choi or other higher-ups

15:01.901 --> 15:03.611
probably thought it's more important

15:03.694 --> 15:06.697
not to let anyone else
get their hands on the lunar water.

15:07.698 --> 15:11.827
Knowing everyone in this station
was killed by that very lunar water?

15:12.828 --> 15:14.914
There are enough reasons
to take this risk.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.219
I think…

15:31.221 --> 15:33.015
my sister deleted all the research data.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.977
Perhaps she hoped no one
would find out about the lunar water.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.987
Then why do you think
she left you that message?

15:48.572 --> 15:49.406
In the end,

15:50.115 --> 15:52.701
she probably thought
someone had to do this.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.453
Wouldn't that be why she called you here?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.538
I'm not sure.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.839
Once I find out the entire truth,

16:06.340 --> 16:08.801
what am I really supposed to do?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.181
I have no idea.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.093
My device.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.437
Drop your gun.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.316
Why are you doing this?

18:31.318 --> 18:32.194
Drop your gun!

19:17.781 --> 19:19.783
Dr. Song, are you ready?

19:21.577 --> 19:22.411
Yes.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.497
To your position.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.708
Yes, sir.

19:28.709 --> 19:29.793
Let's get ready.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.181
<i>Lieutenant Ryu, can you hear me?</i>

19:42.848 --> 19:44.349
<i>Lieutenant Ryu, where are you?</i>

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
<i>Lieutenant Ryu.</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:48.103
Doc Hong, what's going on?

19:48.187 --> 19:52.024
Lieutenant Ryu and E2 are both missing.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.109
<i>I'm not sure where they are.</i>

19:54.193 --> 19:56.111
What do you mean, they're both missing?

19:56.612 --> 19:58.447
Did E2 regain consciousness?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.490
No, he hasn't come back.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.910
Even if he did,
he can't move in that condition.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.122
I understand. Please be on standby.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.750
-We'll be there as soon as--
-Captain.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.099
She's here.

21:48.015 --> 21:48.890
Now.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.026
Dr. Song, come on out.

22:30.974 --> 22:31.975
No.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.560
No.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.104
Don't move.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.690
You'll get more hurt.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.210
Luna?

22:59.920 --> 23:02.756
Luna 073?

24:03.733 --> 24:06.653
This is the best we can do for her.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.034
Dr. Song…

24:19.666 --> 24:20.709
Are you okay?

24:35.390 --> 24:36.808
We got her, Doc Hong.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.935
<i>We finally got that monster.</i>

24:39.019 --> 24:40.812
What? You got her?

24:41.646 --> 24:42.481
Okay.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.318
Are E2 and Lieutenant Ryu with you?

24:46.401 --> 24:47.652
What a relief.

24:48.403 --> 24:50.322
We can go home now.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.490
Yes, okay.

24:52.115 --> 24:54.743
So are E2 and Lieutenant Ryu with you?

24:54.826 --> 24:57.037
No, that's why I'm heading over there now.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.040
No, don't come back here.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.501
Go to the command center
and find their locations.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.710
I'll stay here.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.212
They might come back.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.796
All right, then.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.193
Captain.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.405
Is everyone all right?

25:36.993 --> 25:38.703
I'll get her ready to be transported.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.964
Let's get her treated first.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.600
Do we hand her over to the backup
as soon as they get here?

26:03.311 --> 26:05.313
They will take her to Earth, won't they?

26:05.397 --> 26:07.190
Do you know what will happen to her

26:07.983 --> 26:09.067
and where she'll go?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.829
GATE CLOSURE

26:21.413 --> 26:22.831
<i>Activating gate closure.</i>

26:23.623 --> 26:26.126
<i>Activating machine room gate closure.</i>

26:38.430 --> 26:39.472
Dr. Song, no!

26:46.021 --> 26:47.647
Darn it, what's going on?

26:51.359 --> 26:52.902
What is this?

26:52.986 --> 26:54.487
What the heck is going on?

26:55.405 --> 26:56.323
Damn it.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.763
Dr. Song!

27:24.100 --> 27:25.018
Dr. Song…

27:39.741 --> 27:43.453
<i>Activating gate closure. All members,</i>
<i>evacuate from the machine room.</i>

27:43.536 --> 27:45.330
Captain, we have to move now.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.583
-This way.
-<i>Evacuate from the machine room.</i>

28:06.184 --> 28:08.311
<i>Activating main lab closure.</i>

28:08.395 --> 28:10.647
<i>Activating main lab closure.</i>

28:10.730 --> 28:13.692
<i>All members, evacuate from the main lab.</i>

28:14.943 --> 28:16.945
<i>Activating main lab closure.</i>

28:17.028 --> 28:19.114
<i>Activating main lab closure.</i>

28:19.197 --> 28:22.200
<i>All members, evacuate from the main lab.</i>

28:23.076 --> 28:25.286
<i>Activating main lab closure.</i>

28:25.370 --> 28:27.622
<i>Activating main lab closure.</i>

28:27.706 --> 28:30.667
<i>All members, evacuate from the main lab.</i>

28:32.627 --> 28:33.461
Captain.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.296
Captain!

28:35.380 --> 28:36.506
We're now…

28:37.132 --> 28:38.758
The main lab is shut down.

28:38.842 --> 28:42.220
The fire door just shut off the area.
What's going on? Is everyone okay?

28:42.303 --> 28:44.305
We're trying to get
a grasp of the situation.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.558
Kim Sun, where are you?

28:47.559 --> 28:48.727
I barely escaped.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.187
I'm on my way to the command center.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.942
Check the system when you get there,
and locate the crew.

28:56.025 --> 28:56.943
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

29:08.037 --> 29:08.997
Captain.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.332
Captain, can you hear me?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.604
<i>Shutdown complete.</i>

29:34.522 --> 29:35.648
It won't open.

29:44.699 --> 29:48.161
Captain, I don't think
the entire station was shut down.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.746
Just a few areas.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.083
<i>Doc, have you found E2 and Taesuk?</i>

29:54.167 --> 29:55.919
No, I can't reach them.

29:57.045 --> 29:57.921
For now,

29:58.755 --> 30:01.758
I'll pick up the lunar water samples
and find a way out of here.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.487
They're probably still in the shaft.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.574
This is AP-4,
connected to the outside of the station.

30:27.450 --> 30:30.662
We can come across where Dr. Song is
at the second intersection.

30:31.162 --> 30:31.996
Ryu Taesuk…

30:33.289 --> 30:35.166
He volunteered for this mission, right?

30:38.920 --> 30:40.505
Yes, that's what I confirmed.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.962
GATE CLOSURE

31:45.570 --> 31:46.821
Where did you go?

32:02.837 --> 32:03.796
Were you

32:05.298 --> 32:06.758
waiting for me?

36:00.825 --> 36:01.659
Are you okay?

36:06.831 --> 36:08.666
Does your leg hurt?

36:12.336 --> 36:13.254
Have you been

36:14.797 --> 36:16.632
living here all along?

36:29.562 --> 36:30.438
Do you

36:31.105 --> 36:32.356
want to try this?

36:48.873 --> 36:49.707
Here.

37:12.647 --> 37:13.814
No, no.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.107
Not like that.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.617
Right.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.065
