[majestic music]

00:14.148 --> 00:17.416
[soft flute music]

00:22.156 --> 00:25.791
[banging]

00:25.793 --> 00:27.593
[woman] Dilili?

00:30.631 --> 00:31.663
Dilili!

00:31.665 --> 00:36.101
[speaking in foreign language]

00:53.154 --> 00:57.389
[speaking in foreign language]

01:12.640 --> 01:17.076
[speaking in foreign language]

01:18.546 --> 01:19.812
[man] Still, she is cute.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.547
[woman] That's how it is?
That is scary!

01:21.549 --> 01:23.182
[woman] She's not as
dark as the others.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.416
[man] It's like poison.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.218
[woman] They are strange,
aren't they?

01:26.220 --> 01:28.420
[majestic music]

01:39.400 --> 01:42.801
You know how
speak my tongue?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.536
Yes, better than you.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.472
Or so it would seem.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.874
I would like to
learn more about you.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.275
I as well.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.543
Shall we rendezvous?

01:51.545 --> 01:54.580
Let's meet at 6:30
when I leave.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.216
Outside of gate four.

01:57.218 --> 02:01.420
[speaking in foreign language]

02:01.422 --> 02:04.756
[playful music]

02:09.330 --> 02:10.628
[man] Whoa!

02:13.501 --> 02:15.367
My name is Dilili.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.768
Mine's Orel.

02:16.770 --> 02:20.706
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.874
Likewise.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.178
I brought some fries for you.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.779
Thank you!
Ooh!

02:27.781 --> 02:30.149
It's hot but good.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.152
How were you ever able to
learn my language so well?

02:33.154 --> 02:36.688
My school teacher was
extremely good, Mrs. Michel.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.925
And then I had a
wonderful encounter

02:39.927 --> 02:41.326
with the Countess.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.728
Who was she?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.663
She was the wife of an
ambassador traveling

02:44.665 --> 02:48.167
back to Paris,
on the same ship as us.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.635
It was this boat.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.436
I treasure this prospectus.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.905
A precious memory.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.606
The Countess was attracted

02:54.608 --> 02:58.177
by the shouting of the manager,
when he discovered me.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.444
Discovered you?

02:59.446 --> 03:00.846
They did not want me
to be a part

03:00.848 --> 03:03.715
of the troupe that was
to perform in Europe.

03:03.717 --> 03:08.220
So I sneaked onto the ship
without being seen.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.588
When they discovered me,

03:09.590 --> 03:12.958
after several days at sea,
it was too late

03:12.960 --> 03:14.593
to disembark me.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.963
The Countess stood up
for me and I ended up

03:17.965 --> 03:20.666
traveling in luxury

03:20.668 --> 03:24.836
in her company Above all,
the dearest Countess taught

03:24.838 --> 03:27.906
me all the words
and all the manners

03:27.908 --> 03:30.309
of her tribe.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.778
Thank you.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.979
Have more than one.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.715
[munching]

03:38.285 --> 03:39.585
-[child sobbing]
-Stop!

03:39.587 --> 03:41.520
You can't go around
on your own.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.921
Not nowadays!

03:44.525 --> 03:46.558
Would you mind if I
played with my jump rope

03:46.560 --> 03:48.427
while we make conversation?

03:48.429 --> 03:49.595
[Orel] Please do.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.597
I love playing
with my jump rope.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.332
But I am never allowed
to do it.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.733
Not during the day

03:54.735 --> 03:57.636
because it doesn't look
authentically Kanak.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.707
I admire how you
managed to get yourself

04:01.709 --> 04:02.941
on that boat.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.944
It's just that I so
wanted to see the world!

04:05.946 --> 04:09.581
I have to confess,
I also wanted to travel

04:09.583 --> 04:12.584
to a country where
I wouldn't be rejected

04:12.586 --> 04:15.354
for having skin too fair.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.289
How come your
complexion is different?

04:17.291 --> 04:19.324
I never met either
of my parents.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.692
But, one of them was French,

04:20.694 --> 04:22.628
and the other one was Kanak.

04:22.630 --> 04:26.531
True here they don't tell me
that my complexion

04:26.533 --> 04:29.534
is too light, but instead,
they tell me

04:29.536 --> 04:31.570
that it's too dark!

04:31.572 --> 04:33.472
-I don't!
-Yes.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.340
There is a good side to it.

04:35.342 --> 04:39.478
You can quickly sort out all
of the fools from the others.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.014
But sometimes I feel
that it would be nice

04:42.016 --> 04:43.882
to look just like
everyone else.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.450
Definitely not!

04:45.452 --> 04:47.953
It's because you're
different that people

04:47.955 --> 04:50.489
want to know you.

04:50.491 --> 04:53.292
I accomplished every task
that I was given

04:53.294 --> 04:54.593
in the Kanak village.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.596
I'm not at all mad
that it is all over.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.432
Does that mean that you are
going back to your country?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.833
I'm not ready yet.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.734
The Parisians have spent

05:02.736 --> 05:04.703
several months observing me.

05:04.705 --> 05:08.006
And now, I think it's only
fair that I observe them too.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.675
I'm just the person
you need.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.010
I know all of Paris
like the back of my hand.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.345
I know a lot of people.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.547
Because, you see,
I'm a courier.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.549
My delivery tricycle
can take us anywhere

05:17.551 --> 05:18.583
that you would like.

05:18.585 --> 05:19.851
Here's the latest news!

05:19.853 --> 05:21.720
Another young girl
has been abducted!

05:21.722 --> 05:23.722
The Male-Masters
have struck again!

05:23.724 --> 05:25.924
Everything, there is to
know concerning the news!

05:25.926 --> 05:28.593
Some customs of yours
are truly strange.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.462
This isn't one of our customs!

05:30.464 --> 05:33.065
This is all very new,
and horrible.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.733
The police are on high alert.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.736
But why would anyone
abduct little girls?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.705
It is a mystery.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.474
In fact, you should
never go out alone.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.509
I do not believe that
I am the kind of girl

05:44.511 --> 05:45.877
that they would seek.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.413
-[snickering]
-You don't know that.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.881
At any rate, in my tricycle,

05:49.883 --> 05:52.050
you will be safe.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.618
Just look at this beauty!

05:53.620 --> 05:55.454
It even has a cushion.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.924
Of course there are
more luxurious vehicles,

05:58.926 --> 06:00.926
but they cannot go

06:00.928 --> 06:02.994
where my tricycle goes!

06:02.996 --> 06:05.530
It will be marvelous.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.466
And it is by meeting
a lot of people

06:07.468 --> 06:10.135
and by asking them
a lot of questions,

06:10.137 --> 06:12.571
that we will unravel
the mystery

06:12.573 --> 06:14.873
of the Male-Masters
and we will set free

06:14.875 --> 06:16.441
all of those girls.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.477
-It's a deal.
-But not right now.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.711
I have to go into town.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.446
Where?
I'll take you there.

06:21.448 --> 06:24.750
Not this time because
my carriage is here.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.118
Hello, Mr. Leon.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.552
Young lady.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.921
Allow me to introduce
you to Orel.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.056
He is a courier.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.457
Young man.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.759
Could we possibly
meet tomorrow,

06:33.761 --> 06:36.728
one in the afternoon,
at this address?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.430
[Orel] Yes.

06:38.432 --> 06:41.400
[playful music]

06:43.537 --> 06:45.537
[Dilili]
Goodbye, Orel!

06:57.751 --> 07:00.886
[birds chirping]

07:08.529 --> 07:10.095
Oh, don't bother.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.063
The Countess is not in.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.766
Ah, the Countess.
Thank you, sir.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.769
But I am visiting
with her guest.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.439
[doorbell rings]

07:22.075 --> 07:25.744
Hello, young man.
I'm sorry but the
countess isn't in today.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.778
Ooh.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.448
Take care, Dilili!

07:29.450 --> 07:31.450
-Let's go!
-Let's go?

07:31.452 --> 07:34.152
-Where to?
-We are going to Paris!

07:34.154 --> 07:35.987
[chuckles]
Paris is finished.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.989
You should let it die in peace.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.758
Paris is not finished.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.826
We are here.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.495
[playful music]

07:43.497 --> 07:45.030
This is Mr. Renan.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.765
He's a historian.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.634
He knows everything about
Palestine in ancient times,

07:49.636 --> 07:52.571
but nothing about
today's Paris.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.939
What are you writing?

07:53.941 --> 07:56.074
The names of all of
the people that I meet.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.510
There are so many
people in Paris,

07:58.512 --> 08:00.912
I could easily
forget half of them!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.581
How nice this is.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.150
Being with you
in your tricycle!

08:05.152 --> 08:09.521
On my very first
day off in Paris!

08:09.523 --> 08:12.624
Male-Masters robbed
another jewelry store!

08:12.626 --> 08:14.593
No traces of tampering!

08:14.595 --> 08:16.228
-Yet another mystery!
-How can we be so sure

08:16.230 --> 08:18.029
the Male-Masters did it?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.631
They always leave a sign.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.500
A note that states:

08:21.502 --> 08:23.902
"The Male-Masters will
straighten up Paris."

08:23.904 --> 08:26.037
[Dilili] We are the ones
who are going to

08:26.039 --> 08:27.839
straighten up the Male-Masters.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.274
[snickering]

08:29.276 --> 08:31.943
Stop, please!
I'd like to see the poster.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.613
Yes, it is beautiful.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.816
A great can-can dancer
by a great painter.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.850
No.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.619
Underneath.

08:40.621 --> 08:44.589
"Public talk by Louise Michel,

08:44.591 --> 08:47.559
human rights, men with women."

08:47.561 --> 08:49.294
Who is this, Louise Michel?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.096
She is someone who always says

08:51.098 --> 08:52.597
what she thinks is right.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.232
No matter what they do to her.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.800
She once even participated

08:55.802 --> 08:58.637
in a revolution.
She was caught and deported

08:58.639 --> 09:01.873
for several years to the
other side of the Earth,

09:01.875 --> 09:03.909
in New Caledonia.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.043
It's Kanak land!

09:05.045 --> 09:06.912
It's my school teacher!

09:06.914 --> 09:08.280
This is amazing, right?

09:08.282 --> 09:10.582
My Mrs. Michel!

09:10.584 --> 09:13.718
I want to see her!
Let's go to the convention.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.687
But that convention
will be in two weeks.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.323
And I would love to meet
your teacher with you.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.025
I'm very intrigued.

09:20.027 --> 09:22.160
I'll deliver this lemonade,
and be right back.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.562
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.663
-Hello there, son!
-Hello.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.866
Oh!
But, could it be you?

09:27.868 --> 09:31.069
The skip rope virtuoso,
herself?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.004
Oh, of course!

09:33.006 --> 09:36.775
I was admiring you yesterday
while I was passing by.

09:36.777 --> 09:41.046
I was completely
amazed with you!

09:41.048 --> 09:45.016
I feel so lucky that
I get to see you again!

09:45.018 --> 09:47.919
I am in need of the
opinion of an expert.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.589
I am looking to
purchase a skip rope

09:50.591 --> 09:51.923
for my goddaughter.

09:51.925 --> 09:56.061
Look! And there's
a toy booth over there.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.331
Please help me pick out the
perfect skip rope for her,

09:59.333 --> 10:03.168
and I will thank you
by buying you a toy,

10:03.170 --> 10:06.037
you can pick any one!

10:06.039 --> 10:08.173
Oh, come here.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.642
My sweet little fairy!

10:10.644 --> 10:12.310
I can carry you over there!

10:12.312 --> 10:14.045
Don't you bother, good sir.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.313
I will take her.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.120
[Dilili]
How beautiful.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.990
[ominous music]

10:26.159 --> 10:27.726
[Dilili]
He left.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.628
I should have known
that the Male-Masters

10:29.630 --> 10:30.829
are interested in you.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.830
I blame myself.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.398
I should have
taken you with me

10:33.400 --> 10:34.966
instead of leaving you
out here alone.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.335
I didn't even have
time to say anything.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.337
Everything just
happened so fast!

10:39.339 --> 10:41.006
At least now we know.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.875
My last mission of the day
will be a much nicer one.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.144
We are going to pick up
an adorable little girl

10:46.146 --> 10:47.979
from school and take her home.

10:49.916 --> 10:53.351
[man] Another young girl has
been abducted in Montmartre!

10:53.353 --> 10:56.054
-How awful.
-Read L'Aurore!

10:56.056 --> 10:58.123
Read the press!

10:58.125 --> 10:59.924
[man] Ask for
Le Petit Parisien!

10:59.926 --> 11:02.293
[man] Another young girl has
been abducted in Montmartre!

11:02.295 --> 11:04.429
Eve is Marie Curie's daughter.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.799
Marie is from Poland,
she married Pierre Curie.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.935
It's a wonderful union
of two great researchers.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.104
Both love and
support each other.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.341
They were just awarded
a very prestigious distinction,

11:16.343 --> 11:18.009
the Nobel prize.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.114
Hello, ladies.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.950
-Hello!
-Hello, young man.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.352
Hello, Eve!

11:27.354 --> 11:29.087
Hello, Orel!

11:30.257 --> 11:31.756
This is Dilili.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.825
And she will be
your travel companion.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.461
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.930
[Eve]
Hello, Dilili.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.966
[playful music]

11:41.968 --> 11:43.868
You are boutiful.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.103
Thank you, Eve.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.938
It's beautiful.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.740
[Eve]
Boutiful.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.475
Beautiful.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.744
[Eve]
Boutiful.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.080
-Beautiful.
-Bou-tiful.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.148
-Beautiful.
-Boutiful.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.384
-Beautiful.
-Bou-tiful.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.719
-Beautiful.
-Boutiful.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.955
-Mommy!
-My dear, Eve!

12:09.463 --> 12:10.829
This is Dilili.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.965
She is beautiful!

12:13.967 --> 12:16.134
Your pronunciation is great!

12:16.136 --> 12:17.802
Hello, young lady.

12:17.804 --> 12:20.839
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.107
So am I.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.042
Orel, why don't
you two come in?

12:24.044 --> 12:26.010
I have baked a fresh pie today.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.748
Hmm, it's tasty!

12:29.750 --> 12:31.416
Mother, this pie
has come out

12:31.418 --> 12:33.017
even better than the last one.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.353
It's because I observe
what happens each time.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.123
I note everything down
and then improve upon

12:38.125 --> 12:39.290
what I did.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.959
[Dilili]
When I grow older,

12:40.961 --> 12:42.393
I am going to be a researcher,
just like you.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.995
No, I will.

12:43.997 --> 12:47.365
Irene, there is room
for plenty of scientists.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.835
Madame, what do you know
about the Male-Masters?

12:50.837 --> 12:52.403
Nothing.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.805
[man] The young girl
was abducted in Montmartre

12:53.807 --> 12:57.008
in front
of the Bateau-Lavoir!

12:57.010 --> 12:59.544
More details in La Depeche!

12:59.546 --> 13:03.948
Orel, you need to go
to the Bateau-Lavoir.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.985
[whistle blows]

13:12.359 --> 13:14.392
[Orel] I hope we can
finally find some clues

13:14.394 --> 13:16.060
at the boat wash house.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.896
[Dilili] Are we going
down to the water then?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.465
[Orel] No. It is located on
the hill of Montmartre.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.101
Bateau-Lavoir is
the name of a house

13:23.103 --> 13:24.836
that hosts artists.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.372
You can meet very
interesting people there.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.375
And they will tell us
what they saw.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.110
Me?
I didn't see a thing.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.211
Me neither.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.345
Neither did I.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.947
I don't even work here.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.316
But Picasso,
he saw everything.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.884
Suzanne speaks truth.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.487
They didn't even try
to hide what they did.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.122
There was nobody in the
streets, but I here,

13:44.124 --> 13:45.523
was by the window.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.092
A nice automobile
stopped near the little girl

13:48.094 --> 13:51.496
as she was going
up the hill carrying
a heavy schoolbag.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.898
A nice looking gentleman
offered to take her home

13:53.900 --> 13:56.401
because she looked so tired.
Before I had the
time to scream out...

13:56.403 --> 13:58.536
[speaks in Spanish]
the young girl was inside

13:58.538 --> 14:01.506
of the car and it disappeared,
heading over the hill top

14:01.508 --> 14:03.308
at an incredible rate of speed.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.376
People said that the automobile

14:05.378 --> 14:08.847
was heading towards
the old Devil's Mill.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.849
The old abandoned Devil's Mill?

14:10.851 --> 14:12.450
But nobody's afraid
of that place.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.086
Yes. But people are saying
that it has become

14:15.088 --> 14:18.256
an entrance to the
Male-Masters' domain.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.958
-Then I'm going there.
-Me too.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.060
Hey, but you shouldn't do that,
pequeñita.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.495
You would disappear,
just like our little neighbor.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.564
Stay with us.
I will paint your portrait.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.433
-So will I.
-So will I.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.935
-So will I.
-[speaks in foreign language]

14:30.937 --> 14:32.103
I would love to.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.606
Your paintings, they amaze me.

14:34.608 --> 14:37.041
I want to create,
just like you.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.544
But first, we must find
the young girls

14:39.546 --> 14:41.980
that have been abducted
and stop the Male-Masters.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.383
I will come back
as soon as it is done.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.086
[Orel] Our Paris tour
isn't over just yet.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.956
[snoring]

15:00.634 --> 15:01.966
This hurts me.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.002
You know,
I have been hungry too.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.070
You haven't told me
everything yet.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.338
Neither have you.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.507
[chuckles]
Takes time, I guess.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.608
Yes.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.610
Oh, look at this
beautiful young lady

15:12.612 --> 15:14.345
with such pretty dress on.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.514
Surely she has some
coins for me, right?

15:16.516 --> 15:18.416
No, I am very sorry, sir.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.485
They give me nice
clothes to wear,

15:20.487 --> 15:21.986
but they give me no money.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.354
Come on, come on!

15:23.356 --> 15:25.556
A nice young lady like you,

15:25.558 --> 15:29.127
surely has something for
a poor old man like myself!

15:29.129 --> 15:33.698
I only have my dress,
I doubt that it fits you.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.500
What's that?

15:35.502 --> 15:36.668
You're just a filthy girl!

15:36.670 --> 15:38.236
Are you laughing at the poor?

15:38.238 --> 15:39.537
No sir!
Not at all.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.372
Please, just let us
go past you, sir.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.207
We have an urgent errand
to run.

15:43.209 --> 15:46.244
Hey, come on, Gimpy!
Just let them go.

15:46.246 --> 15:49.247
They are good kids and
they have nothing to give you.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.684
[Gimpy] Where is this urgent
errand you need to get to,

15:52.686 --> 15:54.152
neat young man?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.520
To the old Devil's Mill.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.522
The old Devil's Mill?

15:57.524 --> 16:00.358
Anyone who goes there
either finds death,

16:00.360 --> 16:01.392
or they give it!

16:01.394 --> 16:02.660
Run off with you!

16:02.662 --> 16:05.129
And don't come
back through here!

16:10.537 --> 16:12.403
He really scared me.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.605
But maybe someday
I will be able to

16:14.607 --> 16:16.374
do something for these people.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.976
[Orel]
Never become like him.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.645
That would be a
great place to start.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.113
Yes.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.318
Here it is.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.420
The old Devil's Mill.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.456
[sighs] Someone recently
repaired the fence.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.024
And the entrance.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.126
You stay here.
I will check around inside.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.495
There is no way that
I'm staying here alone.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.398
First off,
I want to look as well.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.500
And besides, I'm afraid
to stay here after

16:42.502 --> 16:44.235
what we've
been through today.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.703
Okay.

16:51.011 --> 16:55.113
Dilili, don't go too far.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.147
[gasps] Ah!

16:56.149 --> 16:59.017
[growling]

16:59.019 --> 17:01.152
[gasps]

17:08.261 --> 17:11.529
[grunting]

17:11.531 --> 17:14.065
[whining]

17:35.255 --> 17:36.254
[Dilili] Orel!

17:36.256 --> 17:37.555
Are you hurt?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.723
Did you kill the dog?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.426
No, I only kicked him one time.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.327
He has died because of rabies.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.595
And he infected me.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.664
What is that?
Rabies?

17:46.666 --> 17:49.634
It's a very deadly disease,
as you can see.

17:49.636 --> 17:53.271
First, you start
drooling to excess.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.339
Then you become mean,

17:55.341 --> 17:56.808
and then you die.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.744
The Male-Masters have
found a horrible way

17:59.746 --> 18:01.546
to get rid of intruders.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.848
But you are not drooling.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.550
And you are still nice.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.718
Maybe it does not
happen instantly.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.121
But, you are not
going to die, are you?

18:10.123 --> 18:12.723
There is only one person
who could answer that,
that's Mr. Pasteur.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.827
But I can't pedal to the
Pasteur Institute like this.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.832
Help me please!
My friend is wounded!

18:20.834 --> 18:25.703
He needs to be taken
to the Pasteur Institute
without delay!

18:25.705 --> 18:27.672
Please, help us!

18:27.674 --> 18:28.473
Hurry!

18:28.475 --> 18:30.708
He's got the rabies!

18:30.710 --> 18:32.543
[screaming]

18:32.545 --> 18:35.413
Nobody is going to
want to help me now.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.482
Wrong, me!

18:37.484 --> 18:39.684
You're way too small
to handle my tricycle.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.652
You forget that
we are up the hill,

18:41.654 --> 18:43.421
which means that
we have to ride down

18:43.423 --> 18:44.522
to the Institute.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.790
I don't need to pedal at all,

18:45.792 --> 18:48.259
I just need to use
the handlebars.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.328
I am much stronger,
than I appear.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.762
You don't even know
where it is.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.864
[Dilili] But you do.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.665
You will guide me.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.170
[grunting]

18:59.172 --> 19:01.806
Come on, let's see
if you can get through.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.375
[grunting]

19:09.182 --> 19:10.648
-Ready?
-Yes.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.250
And don't take it easy
on the brakes.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.251
This is a fairly steep slope.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.452
Duly noted.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.554
You have saved me,
it's my turn.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.765
All right.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.867
Go right.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.170
Move aside, if you please!

19:32.172 --> 19:33.771
If you please, move aside!

19:33.773 --> 19:34.639
Watch out!

19:34.641 --> 19:36.307
If you please, move aside!

19:36.309 --> 19:37.575
Watch out!

19:37.577 --> 19:39.710
I have a better idea.

19:39.712 --> 19:40.711
Move aside!

19:40.713 --> 19:42.246
I have rabies!

19:42.248 --> 19:43.514
Step aside!

19:43.516 --> 19:45.716
-I have rabies!
-[chatter]

19:45.718 --> 19:47.385
I have rabies!

19:48.855 --> 19:51.422
I have rabies!

19:51.424 --> 19:54.292
-I have rabies!
-[screaming]

19:54.294 --> 19:55.626
No, it was the one
on the left.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.428
This one leads to the stairway.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.330
Never mind, it's a shortcut.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.765
Hold on tight!

20:02.869 --> 20:04.302
Step aside!

20:04.304 --> 20:05.937
I have rabies!

20:05.939 --> 20:07.572
Brake!

20:07.574 --> 20:09.307
-The brakes are broken.
-We're almost there.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.875
Next one on the right!

20:10.877 --> 20:11.976
Here we are!

20:11.978 --> 20:13.578
[frantic music]

20:13.580 --> 20:16.814
[glass shattering]

20:16.816 --> 20:17.982
Orel has the rabies!

20:17.984 --> 20:19.450
Vaccinate him!

20:19.452 --> 20:20.952
Hurry, if you please!

20:22.388 --> 20:24.622
The disease doesn't
spread immediately.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.324
You came to us in time.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.592
With this injection

20:27.594 --> 20:29.560
and the boosters,
you will be cleared.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.362
Thank you, Mr. Pasteur.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.998
You can thank Marie,
all my other companions,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.566
and all the researchers.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.536
Saving people is
a very good trade.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.438
Mr. Pasteur, what do you know

20:40.440 --> 20:41.839
about the kidnappers?

20:41.841 --> 20:44.809
Unfortunately, I know
nothing but a rumor.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.444
Dubious people often meet

20:46.446 --> 20:47.445
at the Grenouillere's farm.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.846
They are our clients.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.549
Orel, as it so happens,
I was about to ask you

20:51.551 --> 20:53.818
to deliver some
vaccines to them.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.386
They are for the cows.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.822
But I guess that you
can't pedal right now.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.357
I will not let you down.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.592
I will use the waterway
and I'll take

21:01.594 --> 21:03.494
advantage of it
and I will watch

21:03.496 --> 21:06.697
the suspects from the inside.

21:08.635 --> 21:12.003
I'm wondering,
where is this waterway?

21:12.005 --> 21:13.371
Under the streets.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.972
After what we
just went through,

21:14.974 --> 21:17.975
I'm going to take you
on a calming cruise.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.278
But I still wanna
meet new people.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.545
People who do things.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.547
And we shall, along the way.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.815
I suppose you're right.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.550
There are people
everywhere in this city.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.653
Yes, but the girls
are still missing.

21:28.655 --> 21:29.920
The ones that were abducted,

21:29.922 --> 21:31.856
and those locked up
in their homes.

21:31.858 --> 21:32.990
It's so sad.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.026
Yes, and now I understand

21:35.028 --> 21:36.794
why all those men
are in mourning.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.029
[Orel] No, no, no.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.563
They are always
dressed in black.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.299
[Dilili] Is there a law
saying that men

21:41.301 --> 21:42.800
should dress in black?

21:42.802 --> 21:44.468
[Orel] No.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.337
[Dilili] You have some
strange customs here.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.938
Where are we?

21:47.940 --> 21:50.741
[Orel] This is the entrance
to the opera's stage door.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.677
You will meet
a great person inside.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.912
My good friend, Emma Calve,

21:54.914 --> 21:57.715
one of the greatest
opera singers in the world,

21:57.717 --> 21:59.583
I've already told her
about you.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.621
This is her automobile..

22:03.623 --> 22:06.390
and her driver.
He's not nice.

22:06.392 --> 22:09.760
Don't park that there,
it's in my way.

22:09.762 --> 22:10.795
I'll take it away.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.063
Hello, Mr. Lebeuf.

22:12.065 --> 22:14.465
I present you with Dilili.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.568
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

22:17.570 --> 22:21.038
Why is that girl
dressed up like that?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.640
Lebeuf!

22:22.642 --> 22:26.610
I completely understand
your reaction sir,

22:26.612 --> 22:29.513
as I have a similar reaction.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.883
Your face reminds me
irresistibly,

22:32.885 --> 22:35.786
the face of a great pig.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.589
-[grunts]
-What do you intend?

22:38.591 --> 22:40.024
Would you hurt
this small child?

22:40.026 --> 22:41.759
You call this a small child?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.861
Do you know where
Madame Calve is?

22:43.863 --> 22:48.566
It's not my job to answer
your questions. [grunts]

22:48.568 --> 22:51.769
[ominous music]

22:59.112 --> 23:01.979
Emma must be
practicing downstairs.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.450
Well, I'm really grateful
you didn't think

23:06.452 --> 23:08.853
that I looked like
a pig as well.

23:10.123 --> 23:12.056
Of course I thought so!

23:12.058 --> 23:14.525
Everyone looks like a pig here.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.627
But one gets
used to everything.

23:16.629 --> 23:21.432
And now, I take great
pleasure in looking upon you!

23:26.472 --> 23:29.540
[faint singing]

23:37.984 --> 23:42.019
[singing in foreign language]

24:08.848 --> 24:11.715
You have sung my new
melody to perfection.

24:11.717 --> 24:14.151
Now, give me a little
bit more time to think

24:14.153 --> 24:15.886
about it, though.

24:15.888 --> 24:20.658
I am most thankful. Please
accept my highest respects.

24:30.203 --> 24:33.237
Here you are, my friends.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.840
Dilili, this is Emma Calve.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.676
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.544
And you just missed
the chance to meet

24:40.546 --> 24:43.948
Debussy, a young
and promising composer.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.716
Oh, Orel, are you hurt?

24:45.718 --> 24:48.486
No, no, it's nothing, really.

24:48.488 --> 24:52.556
-What is inside of the box?
-A vaccine for cows.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.158
For the cows at
Grenouillere's farm.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.728
And I was wondering whether
we could go there by swan.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.180
Of course!

24:59.181 --> 25:00.631
Let's go breathe some
fresh air in the country

25:00.633 --> 25:02.766
and say hello to my dear
impressionist friends.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.902
Dilili simply must meet
them, especially since

25:04.904 --> 25:07.104
they know all sorts
of things concerning

25:07.106 --> 25:08.072
the Male-Masters.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.241
Come on, jump in.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.678
Hello, my dear honey doll.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.780
Orel, sweetheart,
are you able to drive?

25:16.782 --> 25:17.982
Sure.

25:20.653 --> 25:23.988
[engine sputtering]

25:50.783 --> 25:52.316
It reminds me of Jules Verne!

25:52.318 --> 25:53.617
You know who Jules Verne is?

25:53.619 --> 25:54.952
Of course I do!

25:54.954 --> 25:57.621
The Countess
has a grand collection,

25:57.623 --> 25:59.857
and I have read it all!

25:59.859 --> 26:01.325
I want more!

26:01.327 --> 26:03.994
Although, I am not
very fond of Bergson.

26:03.996 --> 26:06.163
It does not smell nice.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.731
We are in the sewers.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.300
It's really convenient
when I need to escape

26:09.302 --> 26:10.868
from my fans.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.937
Plus, I like the
change of scenery.

26:14.273 --> 26:17.041
Orel, you look annoyed.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.576
-I'm not.
-You are.

26:18.578 --> 26:22.780
[sighs] Lebeuf
was very rude to Dilili.

26:22.782 --> 26:25.182
I don't even dare
ask in what way.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.283
I'm ashamed.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.918
That is life.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.188
That is life, but wounds
to the soul tend to add up.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.290
Oh, my poor little pumpkin.

26:33.292 --> 26:36.026
Come here,
I will give you a hug.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.962
What is a... a hug?

26:37.964 --> 26:39.296
You come here on my lap,

26:39.298 --> 26:40.998
I squeeze you in my arms,

26:41.000 --> 26:44.268
and you do the same and
then we stay like that.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.610
What's wrong?

26:52.612 --> 26:54.845
No one has ever taught me
this process before.

26:54.847 --> 26:55.980
It's excellent.

26:59.719 --> 27:03.954
[sings in foreign language]

27:24.010 --> 27:28.045
[singing in foreign language]

27:35.221 --> 27:38.088
Yes. Your friend has
a beautiful voice.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.791
He will enchant people.

27:40.793 --> 27:44.194
[growling]

27:44.196 --> 27:46.430
What kind of monster is that?

27:49.935 --> 27:51.335
[Emma] What about you?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.070
Could you sing us one
of your favorite songs?

27:53.072 --> 27:54.238
Yes.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.174
¶ It's the sun and the rain... ¶

27:57.176 --> 27:58.208
Wait.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.443
That song is from here.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.945
It's a song that
Mrs. Michel taught us.

28:01.947 --> 28:03.347
It's now my song.

28:03.349 --> 28:07.418
¶ The night and the day ¶

28:07.420 --> 28:11.455
[all]
¶ The flowers and fruits ¶

28:11.457 --> 28:15.426
¶ He and he, she and she ¶

28:15.428 --> 28:18.862
¶ She and he ¶

28:18.864 --> 28:21.699
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.200
Nice meeting you too.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.402
You fit so nicely
in the scenery.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.272
And your colors
are so beautiful!

28:30.876 --> 28:34.311
Why, you are not painting
the same thing at all!

28:34.313 --> 28:35.713
Not this time.

28:35.715 --> 28:38.816
Monet is all about colors.

28:38.818 --> 28:42.319
While Renoir
only thinks about happiness.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.288
[Dilili]
There is no more happiness.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.390
Not when young girls
have been abducted.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.726
What do you know about
the Male-Masters?

28:48.728 --> 28:52.429
I have had the honor to
have La Goulue as a model.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.465
And she told me that
the Moulin Rouge

28:54.467 --> 28:56.333
has become a sort of hideout

28:56.335 --> 28:58.068
for the Male-Masters.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.872
The cow vaccines were
successfully delivered, and I...

29:01.874 --> 29:03.073
Look at that!

29:03.075 --> 29:06.410
[growling]

29:06.412 --> 29:08.445
I just saw that submarine
at the farm.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.080
It's full of provisions.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.982
Not only that, there were men

29:11.984 --> 29:13.383
who were wearing nose rings.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.120
They don't speak,
but they paid lavishly.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.056
Seems as if we keep
bumping into Male-Masters.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.358
I intend to see
more of them tonight.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.360
I am going to the Moulin Rouge!

29:23.362 --> 29:25.496
-Me too!
-But you two are too young,

29:25.498 --> 29:27.965
they'll never let you
in the door.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.767
I know my way in.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.203
There's a watchman
at the front door

29:33.205 --> 29:34.438
but not at the stage entrance.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.473
He never thinks
of coming backstage.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.342
[woman]
He wouldn't be welcome here.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.111
My dearest Orel,
who is this with you?

29:41.113 --> 29:42.079
[Orel] Dilili.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.213
She is from Kanaky.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.548
[Dilili] Madame.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.450
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.085
Oh, you can call me Colette,

29:48.087 --> 29:49.419
you little nectarine!

29:49.421 --> 29:50.888
What are you doing?

29:50.890 --> 29:52.322
I'm removing
my makeup after having

29:52.324 --> 29:55.192
performed an Egyptian
pantomime.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.827
It was written
by a lady friend.

29:56.829 --> 30:00.230
I show my body a little bit
during the dance,

30:00.232 --> 30:01.532
because it's beautiful.

30:01.534 --> 30:03.433
It is very nice of you.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.969
It's an interesting activity.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.371
I used to write novels,

30:07.373 --> 30:10.440
but they were all
in my husband's name.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.376
I won't do that any longer.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.512
I intend to go
back to writing.

30:15.514 --> 30:16.914
[Dilili] Excellent!

30:16.916 --> 30:18.015
I write a bit myself.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.384
So many things happen to me!

30:20.386 --> 30:22.286
I'm eager to see you published.

30:22.288 --> 30:26.957
Have you noticed any
accomplices of the
Male-Masters' around?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.358
Not in here.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.094
People we don't know
wouldn't dare to come backstage.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.529
However, they do meet

30:32.531 --> 30:34.832
in the theater,
among the audience.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.567
And Male-Masters
aren't the only ones.

30:36.569 --> 30:39.436
Orel, your friend,
Toulouse-Lautrec,

30:39.438 --> 30:43.373
draws at his table
and La Goulue dances!

30:43.375 --> 30:48.445
-[upbeat music]
-[cheering]

31:01.360 --> 31:03.560
Mr. de Toulouse-Lautrec,

31:03.562 --> 31:07.331
it is a real pleasure
watching you draw!

31:07.333 --> 31:09.566
I wish I could draw like you!

31:10.970 --> 31:14.638
Do it. You draw,
and don't ever stop.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.182
I've been roaming around,
I haven't seen anything.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.384
There, I have your suspect.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.988
Take a look at
this man on your right.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.589
I know everyone in here.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.524
And I'm telling you, this guy

31:34.526 --> 31:36.960
didn't come here
to watch La Goulue.

31:36.962 --> 31:38.528
It does not stop him
ogling her.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.397
But he's here to meet someone.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.599
There are two glasses
on the table.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.401
Dilili, do you think you can

31:44.403 --> 31:47.504
sneak over there and
listen to what they say?

31:55.281 --> 31:57.247
[man] The Male-Masters
will mend.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.983
[man 2] Pretty Paris,
Putrid Paris.

31:59.985 --> 32:01.485
In half an hour,

32:01.487 --> 32:04.421
the district head will be
at the Irish-American Bar.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.156
There he will
fill you in and give you

32:06.158 --> 32:09.593
instructions concerning
the next jewelry robbery.

32:13.332 --> 32:17.000
[mumbling]
...Irish-American Bar.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.268
Goodness!

32:18.270 --> 32:20.938
What is this little girl
doing in here?

32:20.940 --> 32:23.607
Well, she is enjoying
an excellent show.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.376
Which wasn't designed
for children to see!

32:26.378 --> 32:28.312
What do you mean
children can't see?

32:28.314 --> 32:30.280
I can see that these
ladies are beautiful,

32:30.282 --> 32:32.049
and dance perfectly well.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.450
Oh, come on!

32:33.452 --> 32:36.520
Who brought this little girl
in here with them?

32:36.522 --> 32:39.256
I've been on my own
for a long time.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.058
It's incredible.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.962
At a time where little girls
are being abducted each day!

32:44.964 --> 32:46.563
[clears throat] We will keep
a close eye on her.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.999
This place is too noisy
for me anyway.

32:49.001 --> 32:51.034
Let's go to the
Irish-American Bar.

32:51.036 --> 32:52.202
Great idea!

32:52.204 --> 32:53.470
They have the best cocktails.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.672
Let's head to the
Irish-American Bar!

32:55.674 --> 32:59.276
Let me see.
My, my, young lady!

32:59.278 --> 33:01.078
You are quite talented!

33:13.225 --> 33:15.692
[yipping]

33:21.000 --> 33:22.065
Lautrec!

33:22.067 --> 33:24.134
I'm glad to run into you.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.769
I went to Durand-Ruel's.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.004
I saw your creations.

33:27.006 --> 33:27.704
They have personality.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.006
Good work!

33:29.008 --> 33:30.474
Your talent is admirable.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.476
Good evening.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.012
Who's that?

33:35.014 --> 33:36.546
He is a painter, Degas.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.281
Well, apart from Degas'
magnificent paintings

33:38.283 --> 33:42.719
of ballet dancers, he's famous
for being rude to people.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.455
Degas just paid me
a compliment!

33:45.457 --> 33:47.457
Me, poor little Lautrec.

33:47.459 --> 33:50.527
I'm about to die of happiness!

33:50.529 --> 33:52.796
You are among the
greatest, Henri.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.531
It's no news to us.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.534
But there still isn't any
handsome cab approaching.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.536
And it's raining
on top of that.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.605
It's all right, it won't last.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.807
It's only creating atmosphere.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.475
I'm afraid we're going
without you.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.411
It will only take us
two minutes.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.179
Mr. de Toulouse-Lautrec,

34:09.181 --> 34:11.380
I could make some space
for you.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.650
-Dilili!
-[laughing]

34:13.652 --> 34:16.786
Yes, I have never been
in a delivery tricycle.

34:16.789 --> 34:19.755
Henri!
You're not doing it, are you?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.427
Do you have enough space?

34:23.429 --> 34:26.129
Yes, I'm actually
quite comfortable.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.697
[Henri] I've never had a chance
to see the scenery like this.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.534
[Orel] We will not be taking
the stairs this time.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.404
What? You really went down
the stairs with this?

34:34.406 --> 34:37.440
Yes. And I will tell you
that it hurt our bottoms.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.109
I want to do that as well!

34:39.110 --> 34:40.476
Let's go down the stairs!

34:40.478 --> 34:42.379
But, Mr. Lautrec.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.148
I can't do that to you.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.150
[sings in foreign language]

34:52.824 --> 34:54.424
[gasps]

35:02.167 --> 35:03.767
[singing continues]

35:20.252 --> 35:22.419
[laughing]

35:22.421 --> 35:23.520
That was unforgettable!

35:23.522 --> 35:25.188
What an incredible descent!

35:25.190 --> 35:27.324
Dilili, I'm very
surprised that you

35:27.326 --> 35:28.825
happen to know that song!

35:28.827 --> 35:31.862
It was the favorite one
of Madame Michel.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.332
-Good evening, everyone!
-Hello, Henri.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.633
Hello, Randolphe!

35:36.635 --> 35:38.602
This is my little friend
Dilili.

35:38.604 --> 35:41.872
She is a princess from
the other end of the Earth.

35:41.874 --> 35:44.574
Randolphe is the
best barman in Paris.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.544
I am pleased to
make your acquaintance.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.679
[Randolphe] What will it be
for you, your highness?

35:49.681 --> 35:52.415
I would like an almond syrup,
if you please.

35:52.417 --> 35:53.683
And some cognac for me,

35:53.685 --> 35:55.552
before we get to the cocktails.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.420
I received some
incredible compliments

35:57.422 --> 35:58.922
I'd like to drink to!

35:58.924 --> 36:00.290
Chocolat, how are you?

36:00.292 --> 36:02.225
Hello, sir.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.727
Hello, princess.

36:03.729 --> 36:06.763
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.198
What is your profession?

36:08.200 --> 36:09.566
I work in a circus.

36:09.568 --> 36:12.435
People kick my bottom
and it makes

36:12.437 --> 36:13.703
the audience happy.

36:13.705 --> 36:17.207
[Gertrude] A rose
is a rose is a rose.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.576
[Henri] Chocolat
is a great artist.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.811
He makes people laugh.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.480
[Dilili] What a trade!

36:23.482 --> 36:25.315
[speaks in foreign language]

36:25.317 --> 36:27.684
He also dances for fun,

36:27.686 --> 36:29.219
and I try to keep up with him.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.820
Oh!

36:33.425 --> 36:35.225
Look over there, you two.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.960
He is one of the conspirators.

36:36.962 --> 36:40.397
I've seen him prowling
around Emma Calve's car before.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.698
[Dilili] So have I.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.267
We're after some
Male-Masters conspirators.

36:44.269 --> 36:47.437
The man there is one of them
waiting for another.

36:47.439 --> 36:50.340
Dilili must hear what
they're about to say.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.808
Easy!

36:51.810 --> 36:55.378
The villain is using the
flower pot as a cover

36:55.380 --> 36:57.747
to hide behind, as always.

36:57.749 --> 37:02.319
I will help Dilili hide
inside the flower pot.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.654
Satie!
Do you mind playing a song?

37:04.656 --> 37:07.257
[man] He should use
certain battery to--

37:07.259 --> 37:10.460
[speaks in foreign language]

37:10.462 --> 37:13.863
[gentle piano music]

38:14.726 --> 38:17.594
-What will it be, gentlemen?
-An absinthe.

38:17.596 --> 38:20.930
-A glass of Bordeaux.
-Right away, gentlemen.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.634
The Male-Masters will mend.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.671
Pretty Paris, Putrid Paris.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.006
This is an official letter.

38:30.008 --> 38:33.043
It will grant you access
to the jewelry store.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.878
The most precious gemstones,

38:34.880 --> 38:39.582
will be taken out of the safe
because Sarah Bernhardt

38:39.584 --> 38:42.018
is their very best client.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.721
This Wednesday will be unique!

38:44.723 --> 38:47.557
You will be able to
harvest everything

38:47.559 --> 38:49.559
thanks to a secret weapon.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.895
You will get out,
nice and calm.

38:51.897 --> 38:55.532
A buggy, with a very
fast horse will be

38:55.534 --> 38:59.836
waiting for you outside
on Tuesday at five.

38:59.838 --> 39:04.407
It will be behind
The Gate of Hell.

39:09.681 --> 39:13.950
I heard everything. [mumbles]

39:13.952 --> 39:15.652
Orel!

39:19.524 --> 39:22.892
[mumbling] ...Sarah Bernhardt.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.494
...The Gate of Hell.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.563
Tomorrow, first thing,
we'll go to the police.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.531
They'll arrest them
in no time.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.935
It will be our first victory
against the Male-Masters.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.803
We're making progress.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.806
[man]
What do you want me to do

39:36.808 --> 39:39.676
with all these stories
about Sarah Bernhardt,

39:39.678 --> 39:43.747
secret weapons,
and even The Gate of Hell?

39:43.749 --> 39:46.716
It is your job, sir,
and not ours.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.118
[gasps] Get out!

39:48.120 --> 39:49.652
Take them out now!

39:49.654 --> 39:52.655
If you come back,
I'll place you in jail!

39:54.159 --> 39:55.892
If the police
doesn't want to act,

39:55.894 --> 39:59.629
the next best thing is to
inform the lady herself.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.464
Her image is everywhere.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.866
[Orel]
Yes. And this is another one

40:02.868 --> 40:05.135
of Alphonse Mucha's
wonderful posters.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.737
But I can't get
to Sarah Bernhardt.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.572
-Isn't she in Paris?
-Yes, she is.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.841
She just came back
from an international tour

40:11.843 --> 40:13.009
in the Americas.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.645
But I cannot reach
that goddess just yet.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.747
But you might know
some other people

40:17.749 --> 40:18.782
who know her.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.150
Of course I do.

40:20.152 --> 40:22.152
We are on our way
to meet Marcel Proust.

40:22.154 --> 40:24.087
-What does he do?
-Nothing.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.156
He would like to be a writer.

40:26.158 --> 40:28.024
He says he lives, he observes,

40:28.026 --> 40:31.694
and he will use it all
when time has passed.

40:31.696 --> 40:35.799
Anyway, he's in all the salons
and he knows the great Sarah.

40:35.801 --> 40:40.170
When I grow up,
I will be a great actress.

40:40.172 --> 40:43.173
[chuckles] Your dream job
changes often.

40:43.175 --> 40:44.607
I am not changing jobs.

40:44.609 --> 40:45.942
I will do them all!

40:45.944 --> 40:48.611
And my search
is not yet completed.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.513
And I am not the only one.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.148
You would like to keep
pedaling through Paris,

40:52.150 --> 40:54.217
become a singer
and a dancer too.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.586
[chuckles]
You're right there,

40:56.588 --> 40:59.889
and I have been saving my money
so that I can study law.

40:59.891 --> 41:04.594
Injustice outrages me
and justice interests me.

41:04.596 --> 41:07.564
[gentle piano music]

41:20.779 --> 41:22.612
[doorbell rings]

41:22.614 --> 41:23.880
Hello, Mrs. Celeste.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.882
Shh.

41:27.118 --> 41:30.687
[bright piano music]

41:43.034 --> 41:45.168
[Marcel] Such charm.

41:45.170 --> 41:48.571
Yes, that is the proper term.

41:48.573 --> 41:50.507
Hello, my dear Orel.

41:50.509 --> 41:51.941
Hello, Mr. Proust.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.044
Dilili, who comes from Kanaky,
is visiting Paris.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.714
I welcome you, young lady.
My name is Marcel.

41:57.716 --> 42:01.651
And this is my wonderful
musician friend, Reynaldo Hahn.

42:01.653 --> 42:04.554
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

42:04.556 --> 42:05.788
Orel, have you
brought me any peaches

42:05.790 --> 42:06.956
from the Ritz?

42:06.958 --> 42:08.691
No, I'm bringing information.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.895
We have discovered
that the Male-Masters

42:11.897 --> 42:13.563
are plotting against
Sarah Bernhardt

42:13.565 --> 42:14.764
-and her jewelry!
-[both] What's that?

42:14.766 --> 42:16.900
And the police
do not believe us.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.167
We do.

42:18.169 --> 42:20.737
I have to admit,
it is hard to believe

42:20.739 --> 42:24.240
that there would be a secret
weapon behind The Gate of Hell.

42:24.242 --> 42:28.111
No, The Gate of Hell
is actually a great
sculpture by Rodin.

42:28.113 --> 42:29.712
Tell us everything.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.080
I'll call Sarah and
tell her to stay home.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.782
[upbeat music]

42:32.784 --> 42:35.084
With Sarah Bernhardt,
we failed.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.186
That is typical of
Sarah Bernhardt.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.122
Danger or not, she'll be there.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.558
Her motto is all the same!

42:41.560 --> 42:44.694
[Dilili] But now we know
what The Gate of Hell is.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.864
[Orel] Hopefully we can get
there before the thief does!

42:47.866 --> 42:52.235
Mr. Rodin, I am pleased
to make your acquaintance.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.771
No, I am the one
flattered by your visit,

42:54.773 --> 42:56.773
dear young people
who are interested

42:56.775 --> 42:57.974
in my work.

42:57.976 --> 42:59.208
.While you take a look around,

42:59.210 --> 43:01.811
let me get going
with my Balzac.

43:01.813 --> 43:04.747
The noble Zola
ordered this one.

43:04.749 --> 43:07.016
He is another great writer,

43:07.018 --> 43:09.185
and a heroic citizen.

43:09.187 --> 43:12.055
[gentle music]

43:33.178 --> 43:36.379
I am... captivated.

43:36.381 --> 43:37.981
Of all your sculptures,

43:37.983 --> 43:40.750
my favorite is this one.

43:40.752 --> 43:43.386
Err, I'm glad to hear this.

43:43.388 --> 43:44.887
But that one is not mine.

43:44.889 --> 43:47.056
A colleague I love
did that one.

43:47.058 --> 43:49.025
Camille Claudel.

43:49.027 --> 43:51.928
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

43:51.930 --> 43:55.665
It must be really nice
to be a sculptress.

43:55.667 --> 43:56.899
It is.

43:56.901 --> 43:59.669
Oh! We forgot what
we were looking for.

43:59.671 --> 44:01.971
Where can we find
The Gate of Hell?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.306
In the garden.

44:04.643 --> 44:07.844
[ominous music]

44:16.655 --> 44:18.788
-Too late!
-I will catch him!

44:27.932 --> 44:30.366
But, it's not possible.

44:39.110 --> 44:40.877
It's D-day.

44:40.879 --> 44:44.280
Orel!
What are you doing?

44:53.992 --> 44:57.794
Oh, hello, beautiful child.

44:57.796 --> 44:59.228
Hello, good sir.

44:59.230 --> 45:01.998
I wish you a very nice walk.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.402
[laughs] A beautiful
and well-raised child.

45:06.404 --> 45:09.706
It's most uncommon.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.775
[gasps]

45:12.777 --> 45:13.843
Don't be scared.

45:13.845 --> 45:15.344
I am okay.

45:15.346 --> 45:18.481
My cane has broken
but I am fine.

45:18.483 --> 45:22.952
I just need a hand
to get back on my feet.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.388
Please, help me, child.

45:32.397 --> 45:35.732
What are you doing,
little girl?

45:38.002 --> 45:40.203
What have you done with all
of the girls you abducted?

45:40.205 --> 45:41.471
What now?

45:41.473 --> 45:45.141
[grunts] What are
you talking about?

45:45.143 --> 45:49.045
I'm just a poor old man,

45:49.047 --> 45:53.082
I only need a little help.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.418
Oh, you poor old man.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.887
I will carry you
in my tricycle.

45:57.889 --> 46:01.023
To the police, they will
know how to deal with you.

46:06.297 --> 46:09.432
You got a little too close,
but you realized it quickly.

46:09.434 --> 46:11.100
It was rather easy.

46:11.102 --> 46:12.502
He was wearing a nose ring.

46:12.504 --> 46:14.504
Don't judge only by that.

46:14.506 --> 46:17.807
It was so silly of me
to wait for you outside.

46:17.809 --> 46:20.343
But despite another
upsetting moment,

46:20.345 --> 46:22.912
we are making
a lot of progress.

46:22.914 --> 46:24.514
The Male-Masters
haven't managed

46:24.516 --> 46:29.085
to capture me, and we are
going to catch two of them.

46:29.087 --> 46:31.387
This is the jewelry store.

47:02.120 --> 47:04.954
[gentle music]

47:11.062 --> 47:13.029
Sarah Bernhardt.

47:15.033 --> 47:16.866
Oh, not yet.

47:31.583 --> 47:33.850
[Dilili]
But we can't see anything.

47:33.852 --> 47:36.452
[Orel] We're going to
visit her at the theater.

47:40.225 --> 47:41.457
Your turn!

47:45.096 --> 47:47.964
[playful music]

47:57.442 --> 48:01.644
[horse snorts]

48:01.646 --> 48:04.313
[man exclaiming]

48:06.017 --> 48:09.518
You shouldn't play in
the middle of the street,
silly girl.

48:12.423 --> 48:14.490
Learn to behave,
you rude little brat!

48:14.492 --> 48:15.958
I would teach you manners,

48:15.960 --> 48:18.060
but I need to stay
at my station.

48:22.300 --> 48:25.101
[whistling]

48:28.239 --> 48:30.573
[gasps]

48:32.243 --> 48:35.011
How beautiful!

48:35.013 --> 48:37.446
[tense music]

48:40.485 --> 48:42.618
-Giddy up!
-[horse neighs]

48:42.620 --> 48:45.121
[yelling]

48:46.991 --> 48:49.592
[whistle blowing]

48:52.964 --> 48:54.764
[Dilili] Excuse me?

48:54.765 --> 48:56.565
Could you please give me my
jump rope back, gentlemen?

48:56.567 --> 48:58.267
Go and play elsewhere.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.937
-This is no place for a girl.
-No place for a girl?

49:00.939 --> 49:03.606
This young girl has just
captured two Male-Masters.

49:03.608 --> 49:06.375
Something you were never
able to do yourselves!

49:06.377 --> 49:08.044
What's that you say?

49:08.046 --> 49:09.578
You two should go away now

49:09.580 --> 49:11.480
or I'm putting you
in jail with those two!

49:11.482 --> 49:14.984
Mr. Officer, I witnessed
the whole scene

49:14.986 --> 49:16.385
and I would advise you

49:16.387 --> 49:19.322
to give this brave girl's
jump rope back.

49:19.324 --> 49:20.523
This is for you, little one.

49:20.525 --> 49:22.591
Bravo.
A job well done!

49:22.593 --> 49:23.960
Thank you.

49:23.962 --> 49:25.594
Young man,
let me congratulate you

49:25.596 --> 49:28.064
on your swiftness and
ability to unharness a horse

49:28.066 --> 49:29.999
without unnecessary movements

49:30.001 --> 49:31.734
and in complete silence.

49:31.736 --> 49:33.302
And you, young lady,

49:33.304 --> 49:35.738
on your jump rope abilities.

49:35.740 --> 49:36.605
Brilliant!

49:36.607 --> 49:38.274
What is your name, please?

49:38.276 --> 49:40.242
Dilili.
And yours?

49:40.244 --> 49:42.111
-Edward.
-Sorry?

49:42.113 --> 49:43.412
Edward.

49:43.414 --> 49:46.382
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

49:46.384 --> 49:49.118
-What do you do?
-Not much, to be honest.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.486
How do you make a living?

49:50.488 --> 49:52.121
My mother sends me money.

49:52.123 --> 49:54.357
-What is her job?
-She is a queen.

49:54.359 --> 49:56.492
Oh, no don't tell me tales!

49:56.494 --> 49:58.527
I know that there are
no more queens.

49:58.529 --> 50:01.731
It is not in France,
but in Great Britain.

50:01.733 --> 50:04.667
You really do not do
anything with your time?

50:04.669 --> 50:06.135
I live.

50:06.137 --> 50:08.504
I enjoy living in a
beautiful capital city.

50:08.506 --> 50:10.773
The different amusements
it offers, and,

50:10.775 --> 50:13.442
meeting the most
interesting people,

50:13.444 --> 50:14.710
just like right now.

50:14.712 --> 50:17.546
I'm an observer,
and I hope it leads

50:17.548 --> 50:20.683
to something more, someday.

50:20.685 --> 50:21.650
Like Marcel.

50:21.652 --> 50:23.319
Ah? Really?

50:23.321 --> 50:25.521
[chuckles] My dream
is to bring various

50:25.523 --> 50:28.491
different people
to an understanding

50:28.493 --> 50:31.193
that would be cordial.

50:31.195 --> 50:33.396
I completely support you.

50:33.398 --> 50:35.197
I'm glad that you do.

50:35.199 --> 50:36.265
It's the Prince of Wales!

50:36.267 --> 50:37.800
He'll be England's next king!

50:37.802 --> 50:40.403
[man] Your Excellency,
word has it that you witnessed

50:40.405 --> 50:42.071
-the whole scene.
-[man] Is it true that everyone

50:42.073 --> 50:43.406
in the shop was sleeping?

50:43.408 --> 50:45.207
[man] Were you
with Sarah Bernhardt?

50:45.209 --> 50:46.809
I am afraid that I have to go,

50:46.811 --> 50:50.079
I'm on some urgent errands
for a lady.

50:50.081 --> 50:52.081
But this young person here,

50:52.083 --> 50:55.184
will answer your questions
better than I can.

50:55.186 --> 50:57.186
I wish you good day.

50:57.188 --> 51:00.089
[soft music]

51:05.763 --> 51:09.765
You! You understand
the language here?

51:09.767 --> 51:12.101
[sighs]

51:15.673 --> 51:17.573
[man]
Ask for Le Petit Parisien!

51:17.575 --> 51:21.310
[man] The Male-Masters are
defeated for the first time

51:21.312 --> 51:23.579
by a Kanak girl named Lididi!

51:23.581 --> 51:25.648
[man] ...stopped a huge robbery
from occurring!

51:25.650 --> 51:28.551
-Sarah Bernard had fainted...
-A huge robbery stopped by...

51:28.553 --> 51:31.821
Everything in colored
pictures in Le Petit Journal!

51:31.823 --> 51:35.157
[majestic music]

51:36.527 --> 51:39.495
Buy La Ciet da Ver!

51:39.497 --> 51:41.597
-We are the only paper...
-Did you here?

51:41.599 --> 51:44.633
...offer a solution
to Paris' problems:

51:44.635 --> 51:46.135
Let's replace the prefect...

51:46.137 --> 51:48.304
[man] ...by a Kanak
girl named Dinini!

51:48.306 --> 51:51.440
[man 2] Everything in colored
pictures in Le Petit Journal!

51:51.442 --> 51:53.342
Dilili, you have become

51:53.344 --> 51:56.278
the most famous girl
in all of Paris.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.515
But also the most wanted person
by the Male-Masters.

51:59.517 --> 52:01.684
We need to find
a way to protect you.

52:01.686 --> 52:04.186
You're too vulnerable riding
around in the tricycle.

52:04.188 --> 52:07.323
I have too many errands
to run this morning anyway.

52:07.325 --> 52:08.691
From now on, Dilili,

52:08.693 --> 52:11.193
you will be traveling
around in my automobile.

52:11.195 --> 52:15.131
Lebeuf will take you home
and he will bring you
back here later.

52:15.133 --> 52:17.466
He might not be the
nicest person ever,

52:17.468 --> 52:20.469
but his stature
is discouraging.

52:20.471 --> 52:25.307
But I so loved being
in Orel's tricycle!

52:25.309 --> 52:27.243
[man]
Her picture is everywhere.

52:27.245 --> 52:29.178
Her picture is in my paper!

52:29.180 --> 52:31.514
That little girl is famous now!

52:31.516 --> 52:33.682
When will the
Male-Masters put an end

52:33.684 --> 52:35.751
to this scandal?

52:35.753 --> 52:37.770
Quite soon.

52:37.771 --> 52:39.788
Making such a big deal
out of this creature,

52:39.790 --> 52:43.359
or their pretended great
Sarah, or your mistress.

52:43.361 --> 52:47.630
Hmph! That word, mistress is
an outraging word on its own.

52:47.632 --> 52:49.532
She is the one who
should be your driver,

52:49.534 --> 52:52.368
and wait for your orders.

52:52.370 --> 52:54.236
Oh sure!

52:54.238 --> 52:57.873
But she would never be able
to drive an automobile.

52:57.875 --> 52:59.341
[man] Of course not.

52:59.343 --> 53:00.709
And you know what
the worst part is?

53:00.711 --> 53:03.612
That Calve has decided
it should be my job

53:03.614 --> 53:06.582
to drive this brat around
in order to protect her

53:06.584 --> 53:08.450
from the Male-Masters.

53:08.452 --> 53:11.754
[giggles]
The idea is amusing.

53:11.756 --> 53:14.957
See, I've been
watching you closely

53:14.959 --> 53:21.697
and I can tell that you
are a Male-Master.

53:21.699 --> 53:22.865
Oh.

53:22.867 --> 53:25.601
I happen to be a member
of the fellowship

53:25.603 --> 53:27.403
that will bring
order back to Paris.

53:27.405 --> 53:32.474
Note that we are already ruling
all of Paris's underground.

53:32.476 --> 53:35.244
The Quarries,
the catacombs, the sewers.

53:35.246 --> 53:37.313
It's really easy
for us to appear

53:37.315 --> 53:38.948
or disappear from anywhere.

53:38.950 --> 53:42.685
And more and more people,
some of them quite powerful

53:42.687 --> 53:45.988
have joined our brotherhood
and our mission.

53:45.990 --> 53:47.856
It is now your turn to join.

53:47.858 --> 53:51.994
You will become generous, rich,
powerful with us.

53:51.996 --> 53:55.631
In order to join our ranks
and become a real Male-Master,

53:55.633 --> 54:01.303
you only need
to deliver Dilili.

54:01.305 --> 54:02.404
[gasps]

54:02.406 --> 54:03.339
You will know everything,

54:03.341 --> 54:04.707
once you join us.

54:04.709 --> 54:06.709
This is the delivery address.

54:06.711 --> 54:09.712
Sound the horn three times.

54:09.714 --> 54:12.581
I've sent two bodyguards
to your place,

54:12.583 --> 54:14.783
they will protect you
against the Male-Masters.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.819
I have talked
to your governess,

54:16.821 --> 54:19.305
who is waiting.

54:19.306 --> 54:21.790
Lebeuf, I'm entrusting you
with our little star.

54:23.261 --> 54:24.593
Goodbye, sweetie.

54:24.595 --> 54:27.296
Have fun reading and
jumping rope, Dilili!

54:27.298 --> 54:30.666
Goodbye, Emma.
Goodbye, Orel.

54:34.305 --> 54:36.272
That Lebeuf is exasperating!

54:36.274 --> 54:37.740
I've been waiting for hours!

54:37.742 --> 54:39.608
What is he doing?

54:39.610 --> 54:42.378
It's midnight.
No one.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.851
-[phone ringing]
-Hello?

54:48.853 --> 54:50.886
Madame Calve,
this is Orel speaking.

54:50.888 --> 54:53.722
I was in Dilili's
neighborhood and I came by

54:53.724 --> 54:55.824
to say hello and
to visit with her.

54:55.826 --> 54:57.026
She isn't here.

54:57.028 --> 54:59.928
Lebeuf never brought her
back here.

54:59.930 --> 55:01.463
Where does he live?

55:01.465 --> 55:03.065
Right! I'm off!

55:03.067 --> 55:05.934
[frantic music]

55:12.009 --> 55:13.442
There's no one.

55:13.444 --> 55:14.576
Lebeuf didn't come back.

55:14.578 --> 55:15.878
What should we do?

55:15.880 --> 55:18.547
[gasps] Do you hear that?

55:20.618 --> 55:21.850
What happened to you?

55:21.852 --> 55:22.985
Where have you been?

55:22.987 --> 55:24.320
Where is Dilili?

55:24.322 --> 55:25.621
They can hear us from out here.

55:25.623 --> 55:27.423
Let's go to the lake.

55:28.459 --> 55:30.559
I warn you, it's ugly.

55:30.561 --> 55:33.729
A man came to me saying
he was a Male-Master,

55:33.731 --> 55:35.497
and he said I had what it takes

55:35.499 --> 55:38.400
to be a powerful
Male-Master myself.

55:38.402 --> 55:40.602
I only had to give them
the girl, Dilili.

55:40.604 --> 55:42.771
And then you entrusted me
with the little girl.

55:42.773 --> 55:46.875
Lebeuf, I'm entrusting you
with our little star.

55:48.746 --> 55:50.546
Goodbye, sweetie.

55:50.548 --> 55:52.748
Have fun reading and
jumping rope, Dilili!

55:52.750 --> 55:56.018
Goodbye, Emma.
Goodbye, Orel.

55:57.388 --> 56:00.422
[ominous music]

56:17.041 --> 56:18.574
[grunting]

56:18.576 --> 56:20.909
[gasps] This isn't
the right path!

56:20.911 --> 56:22.578
Shut up, girl.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.847
If anyone here knows
the way to go, it's me.

56:24.849 --> 56:27.783
[tense music]

56:35.059 --> 56:37.960
[horn honks]

56:41.031 --> 56:42.765
[Dilili gasps]

56:44.635 --> 56:49.004
Congratulations, Lebeuf,
you have passed your test.

56:49.006 --> 56:51.006
You're one of us now.

56:51.008 --> 56:55.844
You're about to meet the
great Male-Master in person.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.413
Go down this ramp.

57:08.192 --> 57:10.692
Follow me.

57:10.694 --> 57:12.628
The Male-Masters will mend.

57:12.630 --> 57:14.863
[man] Pretty Paris,
Putrid Paris.

57:27.745 --> 57:29.945
[rumbling]

57:41.559 --> 57:44.593
[ominous music]

58:13.123 --> 58:15.724
[yawning]

58:24.668 --> 58:28.570
[both] Praise the
Great Male-Master!

58:34.144 --> 58:37.246
I congratulate you,
new brother.

58:37.248 --> 58:41.183
You proved to be
a real Male-Master.

58:41.185 --> 58:45.187
Nothing will be hidden
from you anymore.

58:45.189 --> 58:46.622
Have a seat.

58:46.624 --> 58:50.659
I will answer
all your questions.

58:50.661 --> 58:53.896
Master, why do we kidnap
little girls?

58:53.898 --> 58:57.766
-In order to save the world.
-Uh...

58:57.768 --> 59:02.137
In Paris, the natural law
has been flouted by women

59:02.139 --> 59:04.640
who have taken power.

59:04.642 --> 59:08.610
We need to fix our Paris
before this abomination

59:08.612 --> 59:11.980
spreads through
the rest of the world.

59:11.982 --> 59:15.150
Well, they don't have
that much power, yet.

59:15.152 --> 59:19.187
Universities have
granted access to women.

59:19.189 --> 59:21.256
There are no more limits!

59:21.258 --> 59:25.894
And, my poor friend,
your own boss is a woman.

59:25.896 --> 59:28.096
Uh, that is true.

59:28.098 --> 59:29.798
All of these females

59:29.800 --> 59:33.902
have implemented a devilish
invention: The salons.

59:33.904 --> 59:36.305
They invite in
whomever they like.

59:36.307 --> 59:39.741
They make people meet
however they please.

59:39.743 --> 59:43.178
They even help
whomever they like.

59:43.180 --> 59:44.713
It's true.

59:44.715 --> 59:47.683
So there are no women here?

59:47.685 --> 59:49.952
What do you mean, no women?

59:49.954 --> 59:51.853
You are sitting on one.

59:59.863 --> 01:00:01.196
S-260!

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:04.199
A four-leg must
never look at a man.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.300
Yes.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:07.269
The right term isn't woman.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.304
They are four-legs.

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:10.639
Why did you get up?

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:12.641
Is she not comfortable enough?

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:15.043
Would you like to have
another four-leg?

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.378
No, no!

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.347
Uh, I can't stay seated
for a long time,

01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:21.049
I need to straighten
my legs often.

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:23.352
You young people.

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:25.654
I can't even walk anymore.

01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:29.925
I need four four-legs
to support my seat.

01:00:29.927 --> 01:00:33.662
Actually, there are
never enough four-legs.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:36.064
They are all so slow.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.766
If they walk on all fours,

01:00:37.768 --> 01:00:41.069
they can't go as fast
as they normally would.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:43.305
Normally?

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:48.677
My poor novice,
four-leg's normally walk
on all fours.

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:52.047
This is why they are
called four-legs.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:54.650
Anyway, they are so dumb.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:57.719
We always need more four-legs.

01:00:57.721 --> 01:01:01.857
First, we abducted some of
your grown up four-legs.

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:04.860
Ah, but they had been
perverted for too long,

01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:08.930
we had too much difficulty
in making them submit.

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:10.232
I see.

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:11.933
That is why you
abduct little girls.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:14.703
They are more
docile and tamable!

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:19.207
You understand quickly,
new Male-Master.

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:20.876
We are about to abduct

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:24.212
every young girl in Paris,
and then educate them

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:26.081
in our school.

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:30.819
We only teach them what they
should know as a good four-leg.

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:35.357
We will someday replace all
of your perverted four-legs.

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:41.263
And there will be
order in Paris!

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.932
The meeting ended there.

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:46.735
They say they will give me
a nose ring

01:01:46.737 --> 01:01:49.104
once I have delivered
them a second girl.

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:52.808
But... why tell us

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:56.178
all of these...
horrible things?

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.280
Because no one
will ever put a ring

01:01:58.282 --> 01:01:59.781
inside my nose!

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:02.017
What happened opened my eyes.

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:04.152
It was too much, even for me.

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:06.421
Yes, it is horrible.

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:09.324
And yes, I'm an
idiot and a criminal.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:10.826
But starting at this,

01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:13.261
I will do anything
to save Dilili,

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:14.429
and the other girls,

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.064
and the women.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.467
And prevent those men
from harming others.

01:02:18.469 --> 01:02:22.904
They just harm everyone.
Everyone, including themselves.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:25.440
Madame Calve,
I want to congratulate you

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:28.810
on singing so beautifully,
and dressing so nicely.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:30.979
It brings happiness to people.

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.047
Lebeuf.

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:34.416
In the course of one minute,

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.017
you have made me live

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:40.255
through the two biggest
stupefactions ever.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:43.024
I will search for clues
in the sewers.

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:47.062
[ominous music]

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:56.905
-Oh, Mr. Jean!
-Hello, Orel.
What are you doing?

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.473
We have just learned
that the abducted girls

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:00.208
are somewhere
down here in the sewers,

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.943
and I'm looking for clues.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.278
That's what I thought.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.813
I have been picking up
these little pieces

01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:06.414
of paper that float
from time to time.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:07.916
There are names
written on them.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:09.885
It must be some kind
of secret code.

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:10.919
I will give them to you.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.154
I hope that these
can help you find

01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:13.255
all the girls.

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:15.791
Toulouse-Lautrec, Madame Curie.

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:18.160
Picasso, Pasteur, Debussy.

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:19.895
Monet, Colette, Degas.

01:03:19.897 --> 01:03:21.497
Sarah Bernhardt, Proust.

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:23.098
She's leaving pages
from her notebook behind!

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.266
I have to go!

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:25.367
Go to the left.

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:26.968
Yes, thank you.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.844
Which way do I go now!

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:46.855
Rodin.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:49.991
Camille Claudel.

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:53.562
Oh.

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:23.391
[banging]

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:26.628
No.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.565
I found her!
Come down!

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:35.971
[woman] One, two.
One, two.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:37.105
One, two.

01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:39.608
One, two.
One, two.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:40.609
One, two.

01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:43.044
One, two.
Turn around!

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.313
To the right!

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:46.982
Lower your heads!

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:49.651
One, two.
One, two.

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:50.652
One, two.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:53.455
-One, two.
-It's horrible!

01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:55.423
And our poor Dilili is among

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:59.327
those indistinguishable
creatures!

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:01.229
Stop right there!

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.664
I can see a zero-four-leg

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:06.167
with no hand-shoes
on her right hand.

01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:08.904
[Dilili] I have been
looking for it everywhere,

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:10.305
but in vain.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:13.174
How am I supposed to see
a tiny little black glove

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:15.510
in all this darkness
and straw?

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:19.447
A zero-four-leg must
never answer back to me!

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.117
They have picked
the wrong girl!

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:23.618
You will not last long here.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:27.289
Go find it and
be quick about it!

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:30.425
On your four legs!
On your four legs!

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:32.027
Do something like that again

01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:34.562
and I will throw you
deep into the sewers!

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:37.332
Well?
What are you waiting for?

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.074
What?

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.344
What?

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:52.681
What?

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:57.519
You can not imprison
the sewage.

01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:59.988
I am leaving with it.

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:05.393
[woman] What?

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.562
She is escaping!

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:12.000
[gasps]

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:14.402
No, no.
She will drown in that.

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:16.004
We will recover her
clothes and give them

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:19.507
to another zero-four-leg
who deserves them.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:21.376
The gates will stop her body

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:24.245
from floating too far away.

01:06:24.247 --> 01:06:27.115
[ominous music]

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:36.057
Oh.
I had not foreseen this gate.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:44.566
Lebeuf have you come to
capture me and take me back?

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:46.768
No, that is all over.

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.636
I'm here to liberate you.

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:52.374
Alas, I am still
truly trapped.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:53.641
No, you have won.

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.276
The head has passed through,

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:56.544
the rest will follow.

01:06:56.546 --> 01:06:58.480
Lebeuf, pull on her arms.

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.682
Dilili, turn to your side.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:03.118
[grunts]

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.391
[crying]

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:19.300
[Dilili] You hug me even though
I'm covered in excrement!

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.469
No matter.
It washes.

01:07:21.471 --> 01:07:25.673
The actual poop
are those men over there.

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:29.611
Cry. Let it all out,
poor sweetheart.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.614
We saw what
they were doing to you.

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:38.086
[Dilili] Did you see me
walking on all fours, then?

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:40.288
-[Orel] Yes.
-Oh no!

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.190
I will die of utter shame.

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:45.293
[Orel] No, you are not
going to die of shame.

01:07:45.295 --> 01:07:46.628
We saw them humiliate you

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:48.630
and we all suffered with you.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:52.667
We saw you being a heroine
and we were so proud of you.

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:55.770
And our hearts
were beating strong

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:57.705
for you all along.

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:02.544
I think it would be wise
to get out of here

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:04.612
as soon as possible.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:09.684
Orel, room 13.

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:11.119
Lebeuf, room 14.

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:12.554
And you are to stay there.

01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:14.823
You now need to hide
from the Male-Masters.

01:08:14.825 --> 01:08:16.658
They will soon
understand that you are

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.593
-no longer on their side.
-Yeah.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.129
The costumer will bring you
some clean clothes.

01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:23.363
I will take care of Dilili.

01:08:23.366 --> 01:08:26.100
[laughing]

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:29.604
[knocking on door]

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.738
Come in.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.274
[laughs]
It's the only clean outfit

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.310
the costumer could find for me.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:37.278
You are a prince!

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.781
And you are a firework display.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:44.719
And I?
What do I look like?

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.154
[Dilili]
You look like a king.

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:49.791
Thank you.

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:53.194
Do you feel better,
little one?

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:55.430
I still can't help shaking.

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:58.433
Orel, do you know how
to give someone a hug?

01:08:58.435 --> 01:08:59.767
Of course.

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:03.337
Poor little girl.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.340
You are safe here with us.

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.474
Forget it all.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.841
I don't want to forget it.

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:10.778
The others
are currently walking around

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.546
down there on all fours.

01:09:12.549 --> 01:09:16.917
We know that they train
the girls on the sewer-side.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.287
And then, the girls go
clean up the men's dirt

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.689
in the underground city.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:24.425
And at night,
they are locked up

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:27.362
with the warden in a dormitory.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:30.430
The only opening,
is in another room.

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:33.600
A factory chimney,
through which you see the sky.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:35.569
There is no furnace underneath.

01:09:35.572 --> 01:09:38.339
It must be there only
to bring fresh air in.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.575
But those girls
aren't made of smoke.

01:09:40.577 --> 01:09:42.877
They can't escape
through a tall chimney.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:46.281
Maybe they can,
with a long enough rope ladder.

01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:48.283
What next?
Will they fly away?

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:49.350
-[Orel] Yes,
-Huh?

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:51.685
aboard a large airship.

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:54.255
Mr. Santos-Dumont
could help us with this.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.590
Of course!

01:09:55.592 --> 01:09:59.694
Alberto!
The best Brazilian man ever.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:01.829
But my dear Emma!

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:03.531
It's impossible!

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.567
My little engine
barely has enough power

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:07.435
to support my own weight.

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:11.539
I could try to add
a pedal powered propeller,
but 20 girls?

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.941
I am not strong enough.

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:14.542
To pedal?
All right!

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.477
There is no way those
young ladies should

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:18.813
be released without
participating.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:19.914
They will pedal!

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:22.417
And I am a pedaling champion!

01:10:22.419 --> 01:10:24.752
And I always have
energy to burn off!

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:26.221
And I!

01:10:26.223 --> 01:10:27.989
Have you not seen me
dancing the Seguidilla?

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:30.425
-Oh, we have.
-And I!

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:33.728
All of my hard training
with jumping rope

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.799
has been providentially
preparing me to pedal too.

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:40.602
All right.
[laughs] I suppose I do have

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:42.437
a great pedaling crew.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.973
But I'd need a huge and
light structure in order

01:10:44.975 --> 01:10:47.275
to take on that many people.

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:48.610
And we would need a huge amount

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:51.279
of fabric to make a
large enough balloon.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:52.580
Draw out the plans.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.582
I know someone
who can build it.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.584
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.553
I have friends all over town.

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:00.822
Uh, and where is
this factory chimney?

01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:02.457
I don't know.

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:05.927
Should we really be
building this airship then?

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:07.562
Considering the sewer,

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:10.531
we were in the north part
of the 19th district.

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:13.668
That is where most of
the factory chimneys are!

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:23.544
But, do all of those
factory chimneys

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:27.882
have a weathercock in
the shape of a serpent?

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:36.457
Mr. Eiffel currently lives
in the highest flat on earth.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:39.494
[gentle music]

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:14.529
I would do anything to save
all of those girls

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:16.698
and to lock up
the Male-Masters.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.735
A new metal, aluminum,
will work wonders.

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.036
Mr. Eiffel!

01:12:22.038 --> 01:12:25.840
I am amazed by what
you have constructed here!

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.676
Do you think that I will
be able to build such

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.479
a high building
when I grow up?

01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:34.482
Why sure.
Even higher, too.

01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:36.351
My lady, Berlin on the line.

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:37.985
Thank you, my friend.

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:41.589
[speaks in German]

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.594
Madame Calve speaks the
foreign language very well.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:48.663
Yes.
She's studying German.

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:51.632
She would like to be
able to sing Wagner,
she admires him.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:54.602
And she's close friends
with the Count von Zeppelin

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:56.537
who builds huge aircrafts.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.874
Ferdinand!
What a pleasure.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.075
Very well, thank you.

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.844
Well, not yet.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:07.548
It's about saving little girls
and our civilization.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.751
I didn't expect
any less from you!

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:12.453
I'm in urgent need
of fabric in order to build

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:16.124
a structure of
10,000 cubic meters!

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:18.826
[man] It's a scandal!
The two Male-Masters captured

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:22.096
by the young Kanak
have escaped!

01:13:22.098 --> 01:13:23.765
It's incredible.

01:13:23.767 --> 01:13:26.868
How do the Male-Masters
achieve all of this?

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:28.403
I have finally found out.

01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:29.670
I'm taking you there.

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:33.474
No one understands
how they escaped!

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:36.778
Where is the little Kanak girl?

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.447
We need her now.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:40.848
Kanak, Kanak.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:44.552
When I was in Kanaky,
people called me French,

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:46.888
as if I had no Kanak blood.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:49.557
In France,
people call me Kanak,

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:52.527
as if I had no French blood.

01:13:52.529 --> 01:13:57.799
I want both,
or better, leave me alone.

01:13:57.801 --> 01:14:00.701
[Orel] I live near the
police commissioner.

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:05.006
This is his home.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:09.010
[Emma]
Nice building!

01:14:09.012 --> 01:14:12.880
Opposite, there's a
building with a blind wall.

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:15.983
No one can see inside
the commissioner's.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.492
It's here.

01:14:36.206 --> 01:14:38.506
Where are you taking us?

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:41.509
[Orel] To my room,
and then even higher.

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:44.011
We are going to see
what no one else sees.

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:46.848
This is my nest.

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:51.586
Poor boy, it's not very big.

01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:53.955
[Orel] It's my home,
I feel good here.

01:14:57.494 --> 01:15:00.895
And I have a nice view,
come on.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:03.898
[gentle music]

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:34.061
Hold my hand.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:35.930
I would not want
you to fall off.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.623
Here we are.

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:05.259
What you will see next
is really ugly.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:08.296
We are above the
commissioner's living room.

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:12.633
Well, it's really
ill-decorated,

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:15.770
but why is that
of any importance?

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:16.637
A four-leg!

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:18.573
They are seated on women!

01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:20.174
The police commissioner

01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:24.111
and his associates
are part of the sect

01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:25.713
of the Male-Masters.

01:16:25.715 --> 01:16:27.048
Which means the authorities

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:28.883
won't be of any help.

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:32.720
What we should do is bring
together Sarah Bernhardt,

01:16:32.722 --> 01:16:34.789
Louise Michel and Madame Curie.

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:37.191
They will come up
with some ideas.

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:38.893
[laughs]
It's a nice thought, Dilili,

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:43.798
but alas, some stars never
cross each other's paths.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.601
[somber music]

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:56.243
My dear Sarah,
Dilili sure knows

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:57.645
how to convince people.

01:16:57.647 --> 01:16:59.780
It was enough for
this young heroine

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:03.351
to ask me, and how could
I pass this opportunity

01:17:03.353 --> 01:17:07.288
to meet two other of
my favorite heroines?

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:10.257
Marie Curie and Louise Michel.

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.727
Happiness strikes me
from all sides.

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:15.396
Finding my adorable pupil
from the other end

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:19.066
of the world, reconnecting
with Sarah Bernhardt,

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:22.703
so much talent, and acts
I will never forget.

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:25.406
And, to meet The Madame Curie.

01:17:25.408 --> 01:17:28.743
Marie Skwodowska, how wonderful,

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:31.679
and how encouraging
your existence is.

01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:33.214
Thank you for coming.

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:35.282
Thank you, Louise Michel.

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.385
I don't know how useful

01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:40.888
I may be in a council of war,

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:44.925
but no human being could
turn down such an invitation.

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:46.427
I came to Paris to study,

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:48.929
since women aren't
allowed in universities

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:50.164
in my country.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.667
We must not allow things
to go backwards.

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:56.671
Imagine men trying to force
my sweet young daughters

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:59.340
to walk around on all fours!

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:01.242
Your daughters and you as well.

01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:04.111
And the police
are with the bad guys.

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:05.913
[Emma]
Not all of them.

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:07.214
Of course.

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:09.183
Many of them do a
necessary job well, but--

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.419
Your cats are very big here.

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:13.421
No, watch out!

01:18:13.423 --> 01:18:17.391
[laughs]
It's only Justina, my cheetah.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:20.761
If the police can't help,
the army will.

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:21.929
The army?

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:23.330
Those bunch of
bloodthirsty idiots

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:25.199
who only know
how to blame

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:26.934
and kill innocent
and defenseless people?

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:30.438
It is not the army
but some of the generals.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.074
And some officers
did not follow suit.

01:18:33.076 --> 01:18:34.475
Indeed.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:36.711
The lieutenant colonel,
who was a key character

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:39.113
in the case was
fortunately reinstated.

01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:44.018
Sometimes, I do not
understand a single thing.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.320
Let's leave it for later.

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:49.056
[gentle music]

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:20.755
[Emma] And he won't be in
Paris when the time comes.

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:23.257
The lieutenant
colonel often goes to Vienna,

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.859
at Alma and Gustav Mahler's,

01:19:24.861 --> 01:19:27.428
-since he is a music lover.
-The perfect man.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:30.431
Well, the army's tyrant
will be in London,

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:34.935
thanks to Emma Calve
and Queen Victoria.

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:37.505
Which gives free rein to
the lieutenant colonel.

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:39.974
He and his soldiers
will work wonders,

01:19:39.976 --> 01:19:42.243
the Male-Masters
will lose the battle.

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:43.511
It won't work.

01:19:43.513 --> 01:19:45.546
The lieutenant colonel
cannot embark

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:47.515
on such an operation
by himself.

01:19:47.517 --> 01:19:51.152
He needs to receive orders.

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:56.123
Then let the president of the
republic give him the order.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.491
Of course!

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:59.827
No half-measure here.

01:19:59.829 --> 01:20:01.495
I will ask the president over,

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:04.098
he can never turn me down,

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.499
and I will explain it all.

01:20:05.501 --> 01:20:08.369
The problem is solved.

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:12.506
We are just enjoying a hug.

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:14.475
But we will not wait
until this operation

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:17.077
is all set up to free
our little prisoners.

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:21.415
In two weeks,
they will fly away with us!

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:25.820
It is time.

01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:27.488
Santos-Dumont and his workers

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:29.590
have just achieved
a tour de force.

01:20:29.592 --> 01:20:32.226
[Emma] He must be
on the roof already.

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:33.561
Here we are!

01:20:33.563 --> 01:20:35.963
What's with that
outfit you are wearing?

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:38.966
This outfit?
Well, it is no ball gown.

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:40.968
Just because you
are about to risk your life

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:42.903
doesn't mean you
should be poorly dressed.

01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:45.973
My dear Paul, please set
this situation straight.

01:20:45.975 --> 01:20:48.142
Besides, you need
to impress the girls

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:49.844
in order to lead them.

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:52.446
And you will meet their
parents if all goes well.

01:20:52.448 --> 01:20:54.381
Do you know Paul Poiret?

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:56.050
No, I suppose not.

01:20:56.052 --> 01:20:57.518
He works for other costumers.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.420
But not for too long.

01:20:59.422 --> 01:21:02.456
I am pleased to make
your acquaintance.

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.258
You can't write while
I'm dressing you up!

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.926
I'm writing down your name.

01:21:05.928 --> 01:21:07.027
[Paul] I see.

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:16.070
Here you are!

01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:21.108
[Emma] So nice!

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:22.509
[Paul]
Put this in your pocket.

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:25.279
You can put it in your hair
after your victory.

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:28.115
[gentle music]

01:23:15.758 --> 01:23:19.693
[ominous music]

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:22.429
[grunting]

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:26.033
Now that she's tied up
all nice and tight,

01:23:26.035 --> 01:23:27.668
I would gladly throw her
in the sewers,

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:30.137
as she was threatening
all of the others.

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:32.406
-Lebeuf!
-Don't worry.

01:23:32.408 --> 01:23:35.409
I only wanted to say it,
not do it.

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:37.478
Poor woman.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.280
Get up, all of you.
Get up, girls!

01:23:40.282 --> 01:23:41.281
We are leaving.

01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:42.483
We're escaping.

01:23:42.485 --> 01:23:45.152
We are going back
to Mom and Dad.

01:23:45.154 --> 01:23:47.287
Quickly, run to the chimney!

01:23:47.289 --> 01:23:48.756
[panting]

01:23:48.758 --> 01:23:50.457
Run on two feet!

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:53.660
Never again on all fours.

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:57.664
Go on!

01:23:57.666 --> 01:24:00.401
They expect you at the exit.

01:24:00.403 --> 01:24:01.668
It's your turn.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:02.703
Come on!

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:05.806
-Quick, hurry!
-They're coming.

01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:07.641
Hello, sweetie.

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:08.742
Come.

01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:10.477
Have a seat.

01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:12.813
Good evening...
[speaks in foreign language]

01:24:12.815 --> 01:24:14.281
This way.

01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:15.549
Have a seat.

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.351
Hello, my little flower.

01:24:17.353 --> 01:24:18.819
Your seat is ready.

01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:20.154
Climb up.

01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:23.057
Go!

-[Dilili] Follow me.
-[Emma] Hello, little star.

01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:36.737
[man] What's going on?
What's happening?

01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:39.506
What are the girls
doing this time?

01:24:39.508 --> 01:24:41.542
Step aside!
What?

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:50.217
You can go!
I'll take the small one.

01:24:50.219 --> 01:24:52.319
-[man] Don't let them get away!
-Let the airship up!

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:56.390

¶ The flowers and fruits ¶

The Eiffel Tower's diners

are about to be flabbergasted!

01:25:50.212 --> 01:25:51.411
And your parents
will be delighted.

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:53.280
They're all waiting for you.

01:25:53.282 --> 01:25:55.249
And I will sing for you,

01:25:55.251 --> 01:25:57.451
girls who have been
ill-treated,

01:25:57.453 --> 01:26:01.688
girls who are
coming back to us.

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:04.691
[gentle music]

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:19.473
Santos-Dumont, of course!

01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:23.610
Oh, it's Emma Calve!

01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:27.447
And her nice
little friend as well.

01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:29.316
Yes.
And the little dark one.

01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:30.584
That is Orel's small friend!

01:26:30.586 --> 01:26:33.720
That's right!
It's Dilili!

01:26:33.722 --> 01:26:38.759
And all of the
other rescued girls!

01:26:38.761 --> 01:26:39.760
Champagne.

01:26:39.762 --> 01:26:41.828
Oh, how wonderful!

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:44.598
The little girls are back!

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.836
The world has
become whole again!

-Mamma!
-Dad!

01:28:33.842 --> 01:28:35.709
-My girl!
-Finally!

01:28:35.711 --> 01:28:37.344
-Oh, come here.
-Mommy!

01:28:37.346 --> 01:28:39.746
-Oh my dear--
-Madame, madame!

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:43.550
Hello. I'm the greatest
impresario in Paris!

01:28:45.354 --> 01:28:47.354
Do this for me every night

01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:49.790
and your fortune will be made!
[laughs]

01:28:49.792 --> 01:28:53.460
My dear sir,
it's been a long time

01:28:53.462 --> 01:28:54.861
since my fortune was made.

01:28:54.863 --> 01:28:57.464
There are events
that only occur once

01:28:57.466 --> 01:28:59.633
but will live forever.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:08.008
[girl]
It was Dilili.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:09.643
She's the one who freed us.

01:29:09.645 --> 01:29:11.611
[girl 2]
She managed to escape,

01:29:11.613 --> 01:29:13.580
but, she came back to free us!

01:29:13.582 --> 01:29:14.681
[girl]
Dilili is brave.

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:17.651
[girl 3]
Dilili is generous.

01:29:17.653 --> 01:29:19.653
[girl 4]
Dilili, thank you.

01:29:19.655 --> 01:29:21.021
[girl 5]
Thank you, Dilili.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:22.789
-Thank you, Dilili!
-But I wasn't alone.

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:25.459
-Dilili.
-No, you are not alone.

01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:27.094
-[girl] Dilili.
-No, you're not alone.

01:29:27.096 --> 01:29:30.997
-Dilili.
-No, you are not alone.

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:36.403
Sometimes life turns out
to be perfectly satisfying.

01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:38.839
And it is only the beginning!

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:51.852
[gentle music]

01:30:17.146 --> 01:30:21.615
You are wondering, "And what
about the Male-Masters sect?"

01:30:21.617 --> 01:30:25.852
All right, the lieutenant
colonel worked wonders.

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:28.955
All of those villainous men
were arrested,

01:30:28.957 --> 01:30:31.191
the women were rescued,
and they learned

01:30:31.193 --> 01:30:33.627
how to walk
on their two legs.

01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:35.595
Some even learned how to dance.

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:37.597
Some older ladies
didn't want to walk

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:39.533
if not done on all fours.

01:30:39.535 --> 01:30:42.702
I conceded them a wing of
my castle in Languedoc.

01:30:42.704 --> 01:30:46.039
At least, there is fresh air
and a wonderful view.

01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:47.974
Lebeuf found the same woman

01:30:47.976 --> 01:30:51.178
that he had seen
in the underground city

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.580
and made her forget
all the evil things

01:30:53.582 --> 01:30:55.081
that those
men did to her.

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:57.484
And our little prisoners?

01:30:57.486 --> 01:31:00.487
They can meet
whoever they like.

01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:02.756
They can go to schools
that elevate them

01:31:02.758 --> 01:31:04.958
instead of having them
on all fours,

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:09.696
and I give them all colorful
dresses for each celebration!

01:31:09.698 --> 01:31:12.499
