I'm a fan.

14:14.369 --> 14:17.906
Don't worry. Nadia
will allow you down to her.

14:17.973 --> 14:20.675
You'll give
the roses to Nadia.

14:20.743 --> 14:23.679
If Nadia has intel,
she'll ask to meet you later.

14:23.747 --> 14:25.114
If Nadia doesn't have
any intel,

14:25.182 --> 14:28.351
she will say, "Roses..."
Roses...

14:28.418 --> 14:30.085
- "My favorite."
- My favorite.

14:30.153 --> 14:31.587
"I will put them
in a vase in my locker."

14:31.655 --> 14:33.989
I'll put them
in a vase in my hotel.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.262
I mean, I'll put them
in the locker room.

14:44.869 --> 14:47.704
Thank you for your time.

14:51.408 --> 14:53.475
Auggie...
Nadia sent me a signal.

14:53.543 --> 14:55.244
She botched the script.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.145
I think she's in trouble.

15:02.689 --> 15:04.623
Something was off.
I know it.

15:04.691 --> 15:06.525
She may have
just spaced on the wording.

15:06.593 --> 15:08.427
Here's what you
need to know about assets,

15:08.495 --> 15:10.195
they're not
trained operatives.

15:10.263 --> 15:12.464
They are normal people
who we see as

15:12.532 --> 15:15.200
targets of opportunity,
and they screw up all the time.

15:15.268 --> 15:18.103
They're late, they lose stuff,
they ask for crazy things...

15:18.171 --> 15:19.438
But don't we
have a responsibility

15:19.506 --> 15:22.708
to help her
if she's in trouble?

15:22.776 --> 15:24.109
[Quietly]
Damn.

15:24.177 --> 15:26.111
You played the morality card.
You know I did.

15:26.179 --> 15:28.413
So help me.

15:28.481 --> 15:30.382
All right, if Nadia's
in imminent danger,

15:30.450 --> 15:32.351
we need proof to take
to Joan.

15:32.419 --> 15:33.852
Stay on your surveil

15:33.920 --> 15:36.188
and initiate
the compromised asset protocol.

15:45.198 --> 15:47.533
Make sure you do a head tail--
the van can't know

15:47.601 --> 15:49.368
you're following it
if you're in front of it.

15:49.436 --> 15:50.803
It's a risky maneuver

15:50.870 --> 15:53.206
but professional drivers
always use their blinkers.

16:14.763 --> 16:18.266
If you don't have the right
gear to fit in, be resourceful.

16:18.334 --> 16:20.001
Could you show me
the locker rooms?

16:20.069 --> 16:21.802
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I'm thinking about joining.

16:28.342 --> 16:30.577
The tricky thing
will be getting her alone.

16:30.645 --> 16:32.145
These players
are always surrounded

16:32.213 --> 16:34.947
by their
coaches and trainers.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.359
[Water sizzling]

16:58.909 --> 17:01.110
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

17:01.178 --> 17:03.579
Isn't that thing
gonna melt in here?

17:03.647 --> 17:06.647
[Chuckles]
It's my vice.

17:06.715 --> 17:08.250
I used to
not be able to get

17:08.318 --> 17:10.720
good quality chocolate
in my country.

17:10.787 --> 17:12.722
But now that Estonia
is in the euro,

17:12.789 --> 17:15.258
we get
all the good candies.

17:15.326 --> 17:16.859
Nadia, we need to talk.

17:16.926 --> 17:20.630
Sorry I screwed up
the flower protocol.

17:20.698 --> 17:24.233
But it's very confusing,
there were people watching.

17:24.301 --> 17:26.270
Yeah.
Morozov.

17:26.338 --> 17:27.771
He do that to you?

17:27.839 --> 17:30.441
I tripped going after
a drop shot.

17:32.411 --> 17:33.979
And your shoulder?

17:34.046 --> 17:36.749
You have
the wrong idea about Alo.

17:36.816 --> 17:39.753
He's a good man.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.955
I know you're worried.

17:42.022 --> 17:44.357
I have a solution.
You can come into Langley.

17:44.425 --> 17:45.959
We can leave
straight from here.

17:46.027 --> 17:47.360
I have a car
waiting outside.

17:47.428 --> 17:49.862
Tell your CIA people
to not bother me anymore.

17:49.930 --> 17:52.698
- Nadia, please.
- Leave me alone.

17:52.766 --> 17:57.436
This doesn't concern you.

17:57.504 --> 17:59.439
Nadia is definitely
in danger.

17:59.506 --> 18:00.874
She's just too scared
to admit it.

18:00.941 --> 18:02.575
If I'm gonna authorize
a protection team,

18:02.643 --> 18:04.277
I need a request
from the asset.

18:04.345 --> 18:07.414
Did she ask for help?
No, not exactly.

18:07.481 --> 18:09.048
Not exactly, or no?

18:09.116 --> 18:11.684
She asked for the CIA
to leave her alone.

18:11.752 --> 18:14.087
But how many long-term assets
walk away from the arrangement?

18:14.154 --> 18:16.823
Very few.
A lot of people get cold feet

18:16.890 --> 18:18.958
and stop short
before becoming assets.

18:19.026 --> 18:20.259
Once they commit,
they're in.

18:20.327 --> 18:21.861
Giving up the protection
and the money?

18:21.929 --> 18:24.063
It doesn't happen.
That's because she's scared.

18:24.131 --> 18:26.032
Morozov has
a long track record of

18:26.100 --> 18:28.234
killing the people
who betray him.

18:28.302 --> 18:29.536
All right.

18:29.604 --> 18:31.405
Annie, you'll
surveil with Auggie,

18:31.473 --> 18:33.407
and Holman on tech support.
But keep a safe distance.

18:33.475 --> 18:35.843
If Nadia really is in
as much trouble as you think,

18:35.911 --> 18:37.945
then exposing her as
a CIA asset

18:38.013 --> 18:40.047
is gonna make things
much worse.

18:43.851 --> 18:46.320
Here's to a moment of refuge
in the eye of the storm.

18:46.388 --> 18:48.855
[Glasses clink]
I will drink to that.

18:48.923 --> 18:51.257
If we could bring
these files out of the building,

18:51.325 --> 18:53.192
we could be enjoying
this scotch at home.

18:53.260 --> 18:56.162
If we could bring those files
out of this building,

18:56.229 --> 18:58.631
you still would not
be enjoying your scotch.

19:01.301 --> 19:02.901
Can you read me in?

19:02.969 --> 19:05.805
Oh, it's
just in-house counsel.

19:05.873 --> 19:08.309
Saying the team needs
more time

19:08.376 --> 19:10.311
to get my Tanzania
cables together.

19:10.378 --> 19:11.946
That's the third time
since they came onboard.

19:12.014 --> 19:14.416
- It's the way of lawyers.
- Agency lawyers.

19:14.484 --> 19:17.652
In-house counsel has
a muddled agenda, at best.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.255
What you need is someone
who's solely on your side.

19:20.323 --> 19:22.024
- Hm.
- Someone like Chet Legardie.

19:22.092 --> 19:23.626
Chet Legardie?

19:23.693 --> 19:25.060
He was good enough
for the Speaker of the House.

19:25.128 --> 19:26.429
He'll bankrupt us.

19:26.496 --> 19:28.397
Then we can
dip into our savings.

19:28.465 --> 19:29.832
And then he'll win.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.434
He always wins.

19:31.501 --> 19:33.836
Just hiring Chet Legardie
will imply that I'm guilty.

19:33.903 --> 19:36.338
At every D.C.
cocktail party from now on,

19:36.406 --> 19:38.006
people are gonna
be whispering about you.

19:38.074 --> 19:40.142
It's just a question whether
they're whispering about

19:40.209 --> 19:42.243
you losing your job or
keeping your job.

19:42.311 --> 19:45.646
You said you wanted
to fight.

19:45.714 --> 19:46.847
This is how we fight.

19:46.915 --> 19:49.983
[Sighs]

19:50.051 --> 19:51.952
Well, let's give in-house
counsel a little more time.

19:58.825 --> 20:01.261
Okay, Annie,
the security office

20:01.328 --> 20:03.029
has authorized
a sweep of your house.

20:03.097 --> 20:06.532
But they need you to get
your sister out of the house.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.602
Think you can handle it?

20:08.670 --> 20:10.637
I told them you could,
so...help me out.

20:16.245 --> 20:18.512
Beat you there.

20:18.580 --> 20:19.847
I'm winning.

20:19.915 --> 20:22.917
[Mouths]
One, two, three...

20:22.985 --> 20:24.986
No! Ah!
[Spilling noise]

20:25.054 --> 20:28.490
Ah! Chloe just single-handedly
destroyed the carpet.

20:28.557 --> 20:30.692
Oh!
No, I'm sorry!

20:30.759 --> 20:32.160
I must've given them
too much.

20:32.228 --> 20:33.628
I'll pay for
the carpet cleaning.

20:33.696 --> 20:34.996
No, you don't have to.
That's the price of having kids.

20:35.064 --> 20:36.130
No, I insist.
[Phone rings]

20:36.198 --> 20:37.932
I'll have the cleaners
here tomorrow.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.767
Annie Walker.
Our girl is on the move.

20:39.835 --> 20:41.002
I'll be right there.

20:41.069 --> 20:42.970
I, unfortunately,
have to miss dinner.

20:43.038 --> 20:45.907
Oh, shocker.

20:55.651 --> 20:57.351
They're leaving F street.

20:57.419 --> 20:59.053
They just
pulled up to an alley.

20:59.121 --> 21:02.123
He's pulling her out of the car
and she doesn't look happy.

21:02.190 --> 21:04.124
Holman,
can you give us ears?

21:04.192 --> 21:05.960
These microphones
are parabolic extrapolators.

21:06.028 --> 21:08.095
They actually
send data in real time.

21:08.163 --> 21:09.396
And fill in
any gaps across the arc

21:09.464 --> 21:10.864
from the other mics
in the circuit.

21:10.932 --> 21:13.466
Holman, if you wanna
impress a woman, compliment her.

21:13.534 --> 21:14.934
Don't talk about
your own equipment.

21:15.002 --> 21:17.537
Especially when your
own equipment has circuitry.

21:17.604 --> 21:19.672
I just think it's
all so cool.

21:19.739 --> 21:21.006
He's taking her
inside the building.

21:21.074 --> 21:23.508
Jerry,
can you get us closer?

21:23.576 --> 21:24.776
Annie, I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:24.844 --> 21:26.044
We gotta keep our distance.

21:26.112 --> 21:28.046
If we expose ourselves
and blow our cover,

21:28.114 --> 21:29.915
we put her life at risk.
I know, I get it.

21:29.982 --> 21:31.383
Holman, where are we?

21:31.450 --> 21:32.817
Frequency coming in now.

21:32.885 --> 21:35.887
[Static noise,
loud bang]

21:35.955 --> 21:37.722
That sounds like
gunfire.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.557
Annie,
think this through.

21:39.625 --> 21:42.361
If she's in danger,
I'm not just gonna sit here.

21:55.067 --> 21:56.267
[popping noise]

21:56.335 --> 21:59.269
[Swanky jazz music plays]

21:59.337 --> 22:02.338
To the beautiful
and beguiling Nadia.

22:02.406 --> 22:05.341
My Nadia, so magnificent
on the court.

22:05.408 --> 22:08.077
Happy Birthday.
All: Happy Birthday!

22:14.817 --> 22:16.952
Annie, I'm shutting down
Nadia as an asset.

22:17.020 --> 22:18.153
Last night's near-miss

22:18.221 --> 22:19.954
nearly outed her and you
to Morozov.

22:20.022 --> 22:21.123
But Nadia's
still in danger.

22:21.190 --> 22:22.591
We know what Morozov
is capable of.

22:22.658 --> 22:24.793
If that's the case,
then it's in her best interests

22:24.860 --> 22:26.661
to have no further
contact with the CIA.

22:26.729 --> 22:27.729
So we're done with her?
Just like that?

22:27.796 --> 22:29.297
Just like that.
Precisely.

22:29.364 --> 22:31.265
These newspapers
are your next assignment.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.833
You're gonna
go through back issues

22:32.901 --> 22:35.102
of the <i>Montreal Gazette</i>
to find any increased citations

22:35.169 --> 22:36.870
regarding
Quebecois secession.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.171
- Are you--
- Serious?

22:38.239 --> 22:41.074
Totally.

22:46.814 --> 22:48.581
This has got to be
heavily redacted.

22:48.649 --> 22:51.117
There's just
too much disclosure.

22:51.185 --> 22:52.519
Jai!

22:52.586 --> 22:54.254
It's good to see you.

22:54.322 --> 22:55.788
It's good to see anyone
without a law degree.

22:55.856 --> 22:57.490
Did I catch you at
a bad time?

22:57.558 --> 23:00.527
Not bad, just...
Sort of busy.

23:00.594 --> 23:01.928
All right,
I'll be quick.

23:01.996 --> 23:03.530
Ben Mercer's back in town.

23:03.597 --> 23:05.298
What's the play?
What do you want me to do?

23:05.366 --> 23:08.435
Stay with Joan,
work in the D.P.D.

23:08.503 --> 23:09.603
This was supposed
to be temporary.

23:09.670 --> 23:11.938
Things have changed.

23:12.006 --> 23:14.974
Things are changing.
I like you, Jai.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.609
But the best thing
for you right now

23:16.677 --> 23:18.878
might be to get
some distance from me.

23:18.946 --> 23:20.346
That's funny.

23:20.414 --> 23:22.582
Someone else gave me
the exact same advice.

23:22.650 --> 23:25.351
Someone might
be looking out for you.

23:30.758 --> 23:33.660
Hi, I'm Louis, from
In-Extremis Carpet Cleaners.

23:33.728 --> 23:35.729
Your sister hired us.

23:35.796 --> 23:38.899
Oh, yeah.
Wow, you guys sure are prompt.

23:38.966 --> 23:41.801
Yeah, you know, it's--it's
not really that big a spill.

23:41.869 --> 23:43.336
It's not
the size of the spill,

23:43.404 --> 23:46.239
it's the depth and viscosity
of the radial blot.

23:46.307 --> 23:49.042
Do my kids and I
have to leave the house?

23:49.110 --> 23:50.510
You're welcome to stay.

23:50.578 --> 23:52.045
You may get
a little light-headed.

23:52.112 --> 23:54.347
I think we'll go.

23:54.415 --> 23:56.283
Chloe!
Katia!

24:01.756 --> 24:03.156
We're in.

24:03.224 --> 24:04.524
Commencing sweep.

24:04.592 --> 24:07.461
[Camera clicks]

24:12.033 --> 24:14.901
[Camera clicks]

24:14.969 --> 24:17.137
[Camera clicks]

24:19.473 --> 24:22.341
[Camera clicks]

24:43.067 --> 24:44.467
Auggie, I found you.

24:44.535 --> 24:46.369
Don't interrupt me,
I'll lose my count.

24:46.437 --> 24:48.938
4,005, 4,006...

24:49.006 --> 24:52.208
Have we drilled down
on Morozov?

24:52.276 --> 24:53.643
He's been at
Nadia's practice session

24:53.711 --> 24:54.978
for the second
consecutive day.

24:55.045 --> 24:56.546
He's watching her
like a hawk.

24:56.613 --> 24:57.880
Wait, you're
staking out Nadia

24:57.948 --> 24:59.449
even after Joan
told you to drop it?

24:59.517 --> 25:01.751
Okay, yeah.
I have.

25:01.819 --> 25:03.520
That's a pretty
huge breech of protocol.

25:03.588 --> 25:05.356
But I know something
is going on.

25:05.423 --> 25:07.658
It's like the O'Neal
affair in 1962,

25:07.725 --> 25:09.326
when that violinist
from the New York Philharmonic

25:09.394 --> 25:10.628
was murdered in Moscow.

25:10.696 --> 25:14.733
Annie,
listen to yourself.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.635
You've been through a lot
the past few weeks--

25:16.703 --> 25:19.972
with Sri Lanka,
with Guam, with Ben...

25:20.039 --> 25:22.508
I'm worried
it's making you paranoid.

25:22.576 --> 25:24.944
No.

25:25.012 --> 25:26.812
Maybe.

25:26.880 --> 25:29.549
Look, in our line of work,
there is a very thin line

25:29.617 --> 25:30.917
between intuition
and paranoia.

25:30.985 --> 25:33.753
Our job is to walk
right up to that line.

25:33.821 --> 25:36.690
But never to cross it.

25:38.426 --> 25:42.596
I'm worried about you,
as an operative and a friend.

25:42.664 --> 25:45.432
- I'm fine.
- You will be.

25:48.604 --> 25:50.471
And you may
not wanna hear this,

25:50.539 --> 25:54.809
but Holman's sweep of
your apartment came back clean.

25:54.876 --> 25:56.877
The break-in was probably
just a couple of kids.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.049
Oh.

26:02.117 --> 26:03.951
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

26:04.019 --> 26:06.854
I'll cover it with Joan.

26:09.625 --> 26:12.460
Thanks, Auggie.

26:29.679 --> 26:32.648
Comfort food!

26:32.716 --> 26:34.383
[Bag crinkles]

26:34.451 --> 26:35.551
[Giggles]
We both need--

26:50.334 --> 26:51.802
Excuse me.

26:51.869 --> 26:53.303
Where did they move
Ben Mercer?

26:53.371 --> 26:55.172
Who?

26:55.239 --> 26:57.307
Ben Mercer.
Room 202.

26:57.375 --> 26:59.376
[Typing]
Sorry.

26:59.444 --> 27:01.011
There's no one here
under that name.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.846
He was here.

27:02.914 --> 27:05.648
There's no record of anyone
by that name ever staying here.

27:20.935 --> 27:23.804
[Loud clanging]

27:26.541 --> 27:28.543
- Annie?
- I know I'm probably

27:28.611 --> 27:30.712
breaking CIA regulations
by coming to your house,

27:30.780 --> 27:33.749
and this is over the line
on about nine other levels,

27:33.817 --> 27:38.087
but I literally didn't know
who else to talk to.

27:46.196 --> 27:47.630
What's going on?

27:47.697 --> 27:49.197
Do you know
what happened to Ben?

27:50.900 --> 27:55.036
I need to know.

27:55.104 --> 27:59.440
I understand
that this is hard for you.

27:59.508 --> 28:03.577
And...What I think
will make it a little easier

28:03.645 --> 28:05.646
is for you to separate out
your feelings for Ben

28:05.714 --> 28:07.347
and think of him
as an asset.

28:07.415 --> 28:11.217
Ben would represent a high-risk,
high-reward individual.

28:11.284 --> 28:12.852
Does that make sense?
I think so.

28:12.919 --> 28:16.088
So on a human level,
what that means is

28:16.156 --> 28:19.559
that as exhilarating
as your time is with Ben,

28:19.627 --> 28:22.162
when he goes missing or
does something duplicitous,

28:22.229 --> 28:24.163
you have to accept that.

28:24.231 --> 28:26.599
There are always going
to be questions with Ben.

28:26.667 --> 28:28.834
I'm beginning to see that.

28:28.902 --> 28:32.038
And in answer to
your original question,

28:32.105 --> 28:33.373
I think you're
a strong enough operative now

28:33.440 --> 28:36.776
to intuit my response.

28:36.844 --> 28:39.479
Well, the fact that you didn't
directly answer my question

28:39.547 --> 28:42.916
means that
you know where he is.

28:42.984 --> 28:44.885
And the fact that
you're not yelling at me,

28:44.953 --> 28:47.789
means he's probably safe.

28:50.626 --> 28:53.361
See you at
the office, Annie.

28:56.265 --> 28:58.800
I just don't get it.
Why did they move Ben?

28:58.868 --> 29:00.468
I don't know.

29:00.536 --> 29:02.603
We work in a job with
a lot of "I don't knows."

29:02.671 --> 29:04.371
Did your team find out
anything about Guam?

29:04.439 --> 29:05.939
We did.

29:06.007 --> 29:08.608
The would-be assassins were
a Belgian and a Fin who never

29:08.676 --> 29:10.410
worked together before.
What does that mean?

29:10.477 --> 29:12.245
What's the linkage
between the two?

29:12.312 --> 29:14.413
Well, the linkage is Ben.

29:14.481 --> 29:16.149
Someone wanted him dead,

29:16.217 --> 29:18.118
and they hired the two
perfect people to do it.

29:18.186 --> 29:21.021
The Belgian's an expert
in military security systems,

29:21.089 --> 29:23.057
the Fin is
a weapons specialist.

29:23.125 --> 29:26.561
Together, they
had skills and access.

29:26.628 --> 29:29.364
Other than that,
there's no profile.

29:31.701 --> 29:33.969
Access.

29:34.037 --> 29:35.137
We gotta go.

29:35.205 --> 29:36.605
What?
Really?

29:36.672 --> 29:38.406
I don't get to finish my beer?
You really don't.

29:38.474 --> 29:39.942
Let's go.

29:40.009 --> 29:42.844
[Applause]

29:50.951 --> 29:52.285
Okay,
can you hold this?

29:52.353 --> 29:53.419
[Horn honking]
Ooh.

29:53.487 --> 29:54.954
Okay, I can't
see the speedometer,

29:55.022 --> 29:57.957
but I'm gonna
ask you to slow down.

29:58.025 --> 29:59.727
[Phone ringing]

29:59.794 --> 30:01.162
- Hello?
- Jai, it's Annie.

30:01.229 --> 30:02.630
I just emailed you
some photos.

30:02.698 --> 30:04.766
Can you run them through
the facial recognition database?

30:04.834 --> 30:07.335
- Sure, give me a minute.
- You're looping in Jai?

30:07.403 --> 30:09.204
Now I really wish
we'd stayed at the bar.

30:09.272 --> 30:10.372
I was wrong about Nadia.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.773
Yes, I know.
I told you that.

30:11.841 --> 30:13.642
No, someone's in danger,
but it's not Nadia.

30:17.147 --> 30:18.379
It's Morozov.

30:21.951 --> 30:24.152
Nadia's the assassin.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.721
You were right,
it's all about access.

30:26.788 --> 30:29.190
And Nadia can get to Morozov
without raising eyebrows.

30:29.257 --> 30:32.426
Why now?
Nadia is Morozov's mistress,

30:32.493 --> 30:34.261
she's been close
to him for three years.

30:34.328 --> 30:35.629
She could've
done it at any time.

30:35.696 --> 30:38.665
Because now Nadia can
buy good chocolate in Estonia.

30:38.733 --> 30:40.100
See, you were starting
to make sense.

30:40.168 --> 30:41.368
And now you're
making less sense.

30:45.340 --> 30:46.440
[Cheers and applause]

30:46.508 --> 30:48.509
Estonia
just pegged to the euro.

30:48.577 --> 30:50.745
It's opening up opportunities
for foreign investment.

30:50.813 --> 30:52.814
Morozov probably knows
that he could make a mint

30:52.882 --> 30:55.050
off his land holdings
if he wasn't tied to Russia.

30:55.118 --> 30:57.186
And that's
what he's doing here.

30:57.254 --> 30:58.855
[Sighs]
I should've realized it before.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.690
He's using Nadia's
practices as a place

31:00.757 --> 31:02.224
to talk
to potential bidders.

31:02.292 --> 31:04.393
Going against the Kremlin
would be a suicide mission.

31:04.461 --> 31:05.895
Yeah,
and Morozov knows that.

31:05.963 --> 31:07.263
- Hey.
- That was fast.

31:07.331 --> 31:08.465
That's 'cause
I don't need to run this

31:08.533 --> 31:09.800
through the database.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.735
The man in one of
the photos is Peter Kuyt.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.604
A known South African
mining magnate.

31:13.672 --> 31:16.040
Peter Kuyt?
Thanks.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.408
Peter Kuyt's no friend
of the Kremlin.

31:18.476 --> 31:20.978
Morozov is double dealing and
Nadia's caught in the middle.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.612
I need to talk to Nadia.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.414
You got a plan?

31:24.482 --> 31:25.882
We have a plan.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.717
[Chuckles]

31:30.888 --> 31:33.723
[Applause]

31:46.902 --> 31:48.737
Thank you.

31:48.804 --> 31:51.606
- Um, A-5.
- This is my seat.

31:51.673 --> 31:53.307
Nope, that's my seat.

31:53.375 --> 31:56.077
The match is almost over.

31:56.144 --> 31:57.512
Traffic was a bear.

31:57.579 --> 31:59.114
At least that's
what my driver told me.

31:59.181 --> 32:00.815
- You are blind.
- So?

32:00.883 --> 32:02.818
I still deserve a seat.
I do enjoy tennis.

32:02.886 --> 32:04.854
- Maybe not the same way--
- I didn't--

32:04.921 --> 32:06.222
- Didn't what?
- Didn't mean to steal

32:06.290 --> 32:07.456
the blind man's seat?
Or care--

32:07.524 --> 32:08.925
hey, get your hands
off of me.

32:08.992 --> 32:10.527
Look, just look
at my ticket, man.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.566
Let me see.

32:25.642 --> 32:27.543
Let's go figure this
out together.

32:27.611 --> 32:29.846
I'll walk you up
to the ticket booth.

32:29.913 --> 32:33.649
Okay.

32:33.717 --> 32:35.651
Don't look back.
Walk quickly but calmly.

32:47.663 --> 32:50.031
- Hello!
- Area's off-limits.

32:50.099 --> 32:51.866
Yeah, I'm Nadia Levandi's
personal concierge.

32:51.934 --> 32:53.368
She hasn't finished yet,
has she?

32:53.436 --> 32:55.036
Just, uh...

32:55.104 --> 32:58.874
Drop it.

32:58.942 --> 33:00.576
Nadia wanted an apple

33:00.644 --> 33:02.478
to help her blood sugar
after the match.

33:02.546 --> 33:05.315
She got mad because
I got her a fuji,

33:05.382 --> 33:06.549
and she only eats
honeycrisps.

33:06.617 --> 33:07.751
So I had to go out and
get her this.

33:07.818 --> 33:10.554
[Whispers]
I don't wanna get fired.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.829
[Cheers and applause]

33:37.547 --> 33:39.081
Hey, Nadia...

33:39.149 --> 33:40.315
You need to come with me.

33:40.383 --> 33:41.517
I told you
to leave me alone.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.053
Alo's safe.
He's in our custody.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.488
No.
They'll kill me.

33:46.556 --> 33:48.858
That's why
you need to come with me.

33:48.925 --> 33:51.761
The CIA can protect you.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.467
Thank you.

33:58.535 --> 33:59.735
Nadia!

33:59.803 --> 34:02.638
[Gunfire]

34:11.848 --> 34:13.482
So I take it
your coach is F.S.B.?

34:13.549 --> 34:16.284
She threatened me,
I had no choice.

34:22.091 --> 34:24.926
[Gunshot]

34:28.931 --> 34:30.500
Which way's
the front entrance?

34:30.568 --> 34:32.135
- The front?
- Yeah.

34:32.203 --> 34:34.371
- We'll be totally exposed.
- Trust me.

34:34.438 --> 34:37.274
It's that way.

34:40.411 --> 34:43.246
[Gunfire]

34:50.152 --> 34:51.987
How did you know
the engine would be on?

34:52.054 --> 34:53.788
I didn't.
Some of this is improvised.

34:53.856 --> 34:55.523
Hold on.
[Wheels screech]

35:12.340 --> 35:13.373
[Gunfire]

35:13.441 --> 35:14.841
- Oh, my God!
- Stay down.

35:14.909 --> 35:17.210
[Gunfire,
glass shatters]

35:18.446 --> 35:19.479
[Horn honking]

35:28.455 --> 35:33.025
[Yelling in Estonian]

35:33.093 --> 35:35.160
You have
some mouth on you.

35:35.228 --> 35:37.029
- You speak Estonian?
- Just the swear words.

35:43.304 --> 35:47.775
[Tires screech,
horn honking]

35:47.843 --> 35:48.909
Where are you going?

35:48.977 --> 35:50.178
I have a plan.

35:55.784 --> 35:56.751
Here we go.

35:56.819 --> 35:59.654
Hold on.

36:11.443 --> 36:14.312
[Loud knocking]

36:31.299 --> 36:33.467
- Chet Legardie?
- In the three-piece-clad flesh.

36:33.535 --> 36:34.902
What are you doing here?

36:34.970 --> 36:37.071
What am I doing here?

36:37.138 --> 36:41.141
Your husband hired me.
Apparently at your suggestion?

36:41.209 --> 36:43.209
So I suggest we go inside
and start working on

36:43.277 --> 36:45.311
his legal defense,
because this conversation

36:45.379 --> 36:48.981
is on the clock,
and my clock isn't cheap.

36:49.049 --> 36:51.617
Come on in.

36:57.257 --> 36:58.858
Your lawyer's here.

36:58.926 --> 37:00.593
Just show me
the chair, please.

37:00.661 --> 37:02.462
Great, thank you.

37:02.530 --> 37:07.000
Hi. I'm Joe Jacobi,
of Jacobi and Theisman.

37:07.068 --> 37:10.037
So...Give me
the straight scoop,

37:10.105 --> 37:11.606
I'll do my best to
get you off.

37:11.673 --> 37:14.943
If you lie to me,
and I'll know you're lying...

37:15.011 --> 37:18.347
I'll let you hang, okay?

37:18.414 --> 37:21.483
I can't tell,
are you nodding?

37:21.551 --> 37:22.918
Yes.

37:22.985 --> 37:24.953
So you kids are
just getting your thrills

37:25.021 --> 37:28.722
stealing bikes, loose cash,
that sort of thing?

37:28.790 --> 37:31.291
Again with the nodding.
Yes.

37:31.359 --> 37:33.960
Did you break into
the garage of 4141 P Street?

37:34.028 --> 37:35.562
Answer me, please.

37:35.630 --> 37:38.865
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

37:38.932 --> 37:41.101
- Yes.
- Okay.

37:41.168 --> 37:44.371
Good.
I'll see what I can do.

37:44.439 --> 37:46.206
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Officer.

37:50.612 --> 37:53.448
Was that guy
really our lawyer?

38:09.466 --> 38:11.233
Unfortunately,
I have some bad news.

38:11.301 --> 38:14.202
The CIA can offer you asylum
and protection in the U.S.,

38:14.270 --> 38:15.537
but nothing further.

38:15.605 --> 38:18.473
No more money...
A life of anonymity.

38:20.209 --> 38:22.378
I'll never play
professional tennis again.

38:22.446 --> 38:24.447
No.

38:24.515 --> 38:27.984
Being in public
is too great of a risk.

38:28.052 --> 38:29.353
We've already pulled you
from this tournament

38:29.420 --> 38:32.356
due to a sudden
hamstring injury.

38:32.424 --> 38:34.058
At least I can
eat my chocolate bars now

38:34.126 --> 38:37.128
without the fear
of recrimination.

38:37.195 --> 38:39.930
And you
went out with a win.

38:44.435 --> 38:46.803
I know this whole thing
is terrible.

38:46.870 --> 38:48.104
But this is your life now,

38:48.172 --> 38:49.339
and you're gonna need
to accept it.

38:51.008 --> 38:52.609
Thank you.

38:52.676 --> 38:54.944
For what?

38:55.012 --> 38:58.314
For not trying to make me
happier than I should be.

38:58.382 --> 39:01.484
Americans are always
trying to change things.

39:01.551 --> 39:03.486
But Estonian heart
is black.

39:03.554 --> 39:06.389
We know when fate has
turned on us.

39:06.457 --> 39:08.491
So what do you do?

39:08.559 --> 39:10.426
You live.

39:10.494 --> 39:12.695
It's still living.

39:12.763 --> 39:15.999
I don't wanna just live.
I want more than that.

39:16.067 --> 39:18.035
[Chuckles]

39:18.102 --> 39:21.338
You're truly not Estonian.

39:21.405 --> 39:24.140
No.
I guess I'm not.

39:28.178 --> 39:30.613
Good luck, Nadia.

39:46.363 --> 39:49.198
[Car door opens]

39:51.902 --> 39:53.669
I love this view.

39:53.737 --> 39:55.238
It always seems like
you're closer to the capitol

39:55.305 --> 39:57.540
than you really are.
It's a matter of perspective.

39:57.607 --> 39:59.808
- Were you followed?
- Trust me.

39:59.876 --> 40:01.777
With all I got
going on in my life,

40:01.845 --> 40:03.846
I took no chances.

40:03.914 --> 40:07.082
Welcome back to
the agency, Mr. Mercer.

40:07.150 --> 40:08.817
I must say,
while you were away,

40:08.885 --> 40:10.786
I admired your work.
You helped us.

40:10.853 --> 40:14.255
You helped me out
a lot of dicey situations.

40:14.323 --> 40:16.357
How would you like
to continue to do that?

40:16.425 --> 40:18.726
But this time,
with agency resources.

40:18.793 --> 40:22.262
Full autonomy.
Off the books.

40:22.330 --> 40:24.298
One condition.

40:24.366 --> 40:26.934
What is it?

40:27.002 --> 40:28.435
I wanna talk to Annie.

40:28.503 --> 40:30.204
You know
that's not possible.

40:30.271 --> 40:32.974
There's a reason why you haven't
contacted her in two years.

40:33.041 --> 40:35.009
She's a security risk
to someone like you.

40:35.077 --> 40:36.711
And you for her.

40:36.779 --> 40:39.381
I need to see her.

40:39.449 --> 40:42.718
Hm.

40:42.786 --> 40:46.289
How about this...

40:46.356 --> 40:49.225
Stay in your lane,
complete your missions,

40:49.293 --> 40:51.428
and I'll see if we can't
find a way to bring you back in.

40:51.495 --> 40:54.765
Typical agency
carrot-and-stick behavior.

40:54.833 --> 40:55.966
Yes, it is.

41:02.707 --> 41:05.542
Good talk.

41:08.947 --> 41:10.114
[Car door closes]

41:28.500 --> 41:31.769
[Phone ringing]

41:31.837 --> 41:33.404
Hey.
You need me to come in?

41:33.471 --> 41:35.072
Easy there, worker bee.

41:35.140 --> 41:37.808
I'm just calling to check in
and see how you're holding up.

41:37.876 --> 41:40.111
I've been better.

41:40.178 --> 41:41.946
Do you wanna
meet me at the tavern?

41:42.013 --> 41:44.615
[Walking stick clicking]

41:44.683 --> 41:46.283
Sure.

41:46.352 --> 41:48.453
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:48.521 --> 41:53.191
Am I gonna get to finish
my beer this time?

41:54.016 --> 41:56.018
Not only that...
I'm buying.
