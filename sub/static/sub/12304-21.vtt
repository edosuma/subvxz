00:03.570 --> 00:06.800
DISPATCH: All units in the Star Island
vicinity. Possible domestic disturbance.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.200
Proceed with caution.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.200
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.200
You wanted equitable division of assets,
I'll give you equitable.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.600
I'll take this half.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.500
And you can have that half.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.200
You wanna sink the boat, huh?

00:39.300 --> 00:42.400
Well I'll beat you to it.
How'd you like that!

00:42.600 --> 00:43.700
That's your half!

01:00.400 --> 01:02.400
You crazy bitch!

01:02.500 --> 01:08.800
Crazy? I was crazy to spend 19 years
of my life with a jackass like you.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.800
We're sinking!

01:18.400 --> 01:20.100
You stole my youth.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.550
You killed my soul!

01:21.585 --> 01:22.900
You have no soul!

01:25.300 --> 01:26.300
They're over here.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.300
You're the pool guy, right?

01:27.400 --> 01:28.100
Yeah, Paul.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.000
I've never seen them act this crazy.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
FRANK: Hey!

01:45.800 --> 01:48.400
Put the gun down.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.065
Officer, he's trying to kill me.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.500
HANK: She's the one with the chainsaw.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.400
CAINE: I repeat, put the gun down.

01:59.300 --> 02:02.200
Mr. Atherton, put the gun down!

02:04.800 --> 02:06.100
Who are they, Frank?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.500
Laurie and Hank Atherton.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.800
Dispatch says patrol has been called
out here over a half a dozen times.

02:10.900 --> 02:14.800
- Obviously the nastiest divorce on Star Island.
- Obviously.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.900
Hey, H.

02:19.000 --> 02:19.700
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.100
You're gonna wanna see this
back at the house.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.700
Hang on to them, Frank.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.800
This is, uh, Mandy.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.900
She's the parents' fitness trainer.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.500
The son discovered her

02:34.600 --> 02:37.400
when he was getting ready for school.

02:37.435 --> 02:40.200
Could have started the fight,huh?

02:40.300 --> 02:44.600
These lasers are dividing the whole house in half.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.900
Court ordered it until the divorce was final.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.100
Welcome to divorce

02:50.200 --> 02:52.465
of the future.

03:47.550 --> 03:49.350
Mr. and Mrs. Atherton,

03:49.450 --> 03:52.250
I'm going to ask you flat out,did you kill Mandy?

03:52.350 --> 03:54.150
HANK: She was my personal trainer.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.150
I would never want to kill her.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.550
So you're both saying

03:57.650 --> 03:59.650
you have no knowledge of the circumstances

03:59.750 --> 04:01.750
surrounding the body we found in your house.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.750
I hardly knew Mandy,and besides,

04:03.850 --> 04:05.950
it's on his side of the house.

04:05.985 --> 04:08.050
I don't even go over there.

04:08.150 --> 04:10.350
And honestly,she was a lot of things to him.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.650
It was probably the same guy who stole my car.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.750
When did your car get stolen?

04:14.785 --> 04:16.015
This morning.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.550
Then she hacked up my boat.

04:17.649 --> 04:19.415
Talk about a bad day.

04:19.450 --> 04:21.050
He pointed a gun at my head.

04:21.149 --> 04:22.250
Isn't that,like,attempted murder?

04:22.350 --> 04:24.650
Can you charge him? Take him away.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.550
Charge me? You saw what she did.

04:26.585 --> 04:27.715
Oh,please.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.050
CAINE: Excuse me,folks,but

04:29.150 --> 04:30.450
you're both suspects in a murder,

04:30.550 --> 04:31.750
and you're coming with me.

04:31.785 --> 04:33.950
I'll get radio car.

04:34.450 --> 04:36.450
CAINE: Frank,

04:36.550 --> 04:38.350
get two cars.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.750
DISPATCH: Stolen Lamborghini has been located

04:44.850 --> 04:46.550
Sunspire Drive,Star Island.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.350
Possible homicide involved.

04:56.750 --> 05:00.150
Well,here's the Athertons' stolen car.

05:00.185 --> 05:02.650
Who is this guy?

05:02.750 --> 05:04.050
His name was Stan Lockwood.

05:04.085 --> 05:05.450
Found his ID.

05:05.550 --> 05:07.750
Looks like the victim's the one who stole it.

05:07.785 --> 05:08.850
Hey,Eric,

05:08.950 --> 05:11.050
I do have COD.

05:11.150 --> 05:12.450
Broken neck

05:12.550 --> 05:14.150
at the C-3 vertebrae.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.550
See the straight line

05:15.650 --> 05:18.850
bruising along the back and front of his throat?

05:18.885 --> 05:20.750
His head was slammed in the car door.

05:20.850 --> 05:22.350
(grunts)

05:22.450 --> 05:26.350
Looks like the killer kicked the door closed.

05:26.450 --> 05:27.950
Got a shoeprint here.

05:29.350 --> 05:30.950
I'll get us a dust lift for comparison.

05:30.985 --> 05:32.650
If the shoe fits...

05:32.750 --> 05:34.350
(snickers)

05:48.450 --> 05:50.950
Eric,this may be important.

05:50.985 --> 05:52.650
Got the keys

05:52.750 --> 05:54.350
in a fire ant mound.

05:54.450 --> 05:55.750
DELKO: Ouch!

05:55.850 --> 05:57.450
They look pretty nasty,and they're everywhere.

05:57.550 --> 05:58.600
(camera shutter clicking)

05:58.635 --> 05:59.650
I'm guessing they might have

05:59.750 --> 06:01.250
bit the killer.

06:01.350 --> 06:02.750
Well,I'll,uh,call dispatch,and I'll have them check

06:02.850 --> 06:04.450
with all the hospitals,see if anybody was treated

06:04.485 --> 06:06.250
for insect bites.

06:07.350 --> 06:09.550
Whoa!

06:50.750 --> 06:52.250
Hey,Eric?

06:53.350 --> 06:56.250
This is a bill of sale dated today.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.450
Which means our victim didn't steal the car.

06:58.550 --> 06:59.750
No. Stan Lockwood

06:59.850 --> 07:01.450
bought this car from the Athertons.

07:01.550 --> 07:05.250
Which means the Athertons lied to us.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.115
(screams)

07:07.150 --> 07:08.950
You found my car.

07:09.050 --> 07:10.550
CAINE: As a matter of fact,

07:10.650 --> 07:13.150
it wasn't stolen,was it?

07:13.185 --> 07:15.450
What do you mean?

07:15.550 --> 07:17.550
The lawyers told us

07:17.650 --> 07:20.650
to distribute our property in an equitable fashion.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.400
You sold my Lamborghini?

07:22.435 --> 07:24.050
It was my car,too,Hank.

07:24.150 --> 07:26.250
You said to sell it and give you half.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.450
Say hello...

07:33.550 --> 07:35.850
to half.

07:37.850 --> 07:38.650
HANK: $200?

07:38.750 --> 07:41.450
It's worth $200,000!

07:41.550 --> 07:43.250
So,a couple zeros off.

07:43.350 --> 07:44.915
You're insane. She's insane!

07:44.950 --> 07:47.050
I'm sorry to bother you with this,Lieutenant,

07:47.150 --> 07:48.450
but as you know,

07:48.550 --> 07:51.015
divorces can be quite messy.

07:51.050 --> 07:53.450
Mr. and Mrs. Atherton,we found a dead body

07:53.485 --> 07:55.850
in your car,and we're still processing

07:55.885 --> 07:57.967
the first at your house.

07:58.002 --> 08:00.050
Yes,divorce can be messy.

08:00.150 --> 08:03.150
So is killing people.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.650
(camera shutter clicking)

08:09.750 --> 08:11.850
(garbled radio transmission)

08:13.950 --> 08:16.215
So,this is what happens

08:16.250 --> 08:19.000
when a husband refuses to move out

08:19.035 --> 08:21.750
and a wife refuses to buy out.

08:21.850 --> 08:24.150
Wonder what would have happened if I tried to put my hand

08:24.250 --> 08:25.350
through the other side.

08:25.385 --> 08:26.615
Careful,Ryan.

08:26.650 --> 08:28.850
With these two,it might mean electrocution.

08:28.950 --> 08:30.950
(garbled radio transmission)

08:36.549 --> 08:38.250
(mechanical humming)

08:38.284 --> 08:39.950
(alarms sounding)

08:39.985 --> 08:41.215
Whoa!

08:41.250 --> 08:42.549
That's some serious

08:42.650 --> 08:43.650
surveillance.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.550
(beeps)

08:45.585 --> 08:47.350
(whirring)

08:47.450 --> 08:48.950
(alarm stops)

08:48.985 --> 08:50.415
Deactivator.

08:50.450 --> 08:51.715
Yeah,I guess you'd,uh,

08:51.750 --> 08:53.750
have to have one of those to live here,

08:53.850 --> 08:54.950
wouldn't you,Nathan?

08:55.050 --> 08:56.150
Uh,took a court order.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.650
You found the body,didn't you?

08:57.750 --> 08:58.915
When I thought my parents'

08:58.950 --> 09:00.315
divorce couldn't get any worse,

09:00.350 --> 09:02.550
I find the body of my dad's girlfriend.

09:02.650 --> 09:04.850
WOLFE: Girlfriend?

09:04.950 --> 09:07.150
I thought that was your parents' trainer.

09:07.185 --> 09:09.350
Oh,she was till my mom caught them

09:09.450 --> 09:11.250
going at it a few months ago.

09:11.285 --> 09:12.717
And your mother was

09:12.752 --> 09:14.150
angry about this?

09:14.250 --> 09:15.650
Not really. She was too busy

09:15.750 --> 09:17.415
with the pool guy to really care.

09:17.450 --> 09:20.750
Listen,Nathan,do you have someplace you can stay?

09:20.850 --> 09:22.215
'Cause this is a...

09:22.250 --> 09:23.850
This is an active crime scene.

09:23.950 --> 09:25.150
The family next door.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.650
They're cool.

09:26.750 --> 09:29.050
Okay,good. I want you to go next door,and stay there,

09:29.150 --> 09:31.950
and if I need to contact you,I know where you are,all right?

09:33.450 --> 09:36.850
(garbled radio transmission)

09:36.885 --> 09:40.250
WOODS: Okay,Mandy Felding.

09:40.350 --> 09:42.850
Not a lot of mystery with cause of death.

09:42.885 --> 09:44.915
Blunt force trauma to the head.

09:44.950 --> 09:47.550
Probably one quick blow to the forehead.

09:47.650 --> 09:50.250
I'll collect a sexual assault kit and get it to Natalia.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.350
Alexx,take a look at this.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.950
It's a fresh depression mark on the wall.

09:57.050 --> 10:00.550
(garbled radio transmission)

10:00.650 --> 10:03.150
Oh,wow.

10:04.650 --> 10:07.750
Here we go.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.750
It's got a little bit of blood on it.

10:12.785 --> 10:14.650
This is heavy.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.950
Yeah,this definitely could be the murder weapon.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.250
I'll get it to prints.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.650
(garbled radio transmission)

10:30.850 --> 10:34.550
(camera shutter clicking)

10:37.050 --> 10:39.215
(computer trilling)

10:39.250 --> 10:41.950
How are we doing with our personal trainer?

10:42.050 --> 10:45.050
Good. I was able to pull two clean prints:

10:45.085 --> 10:46.550
a thumb and an index finger.

10:46.150 --> 10:47.350
I'm running them now.

10:47.450 --> 10:49.150
Well,maybe we'll catch a break.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.850
Can you believe these people?

10:50.950 --> 10:53.050
Lasers down the middle of their house.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.450
It's crazy.

10:54.550 --> 10:58.150
Yeah,divorce sometimes brings out the worst in people.

10:58.185 --> 11:00.150
I know from experience.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.950
Your parents?

11:02.050 --> 11:03.515
Yeah.

11:03.550 --> 11:07.350
It was 15 years ago,but I still remember all the grisly details.

11:07.385 --> 11:09.250
I didn't mean to bring up any bad memories.

11:09.350 --> 11:10.950
Oh,no,it's okay.

11:12.950 --> 11:15.350
We got something.

11:17.350 --> 11:19.250
Laurie Atherton.

11:19.350 --> 11:20.750
That's the wife.

11:20.850 --> 11:22.150
But you know,

11:22.250 --> 11:24.650
she said she never goes over to Hank's side.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.950
She's lying.

11:27.050 --> 11:29.450
Of course my prints are on the vase.

11:29.485 --> 11:31.115
It used to be my vase.

11:31.150 --> 11:33.150
So what was it doing on Hank's side of the house?

11:33.185 --> 11:35.550
'Cause Hank knew how much I wanted it.

11:35.585 --> 11:36.615
When we started

11:36.650 --> 11:38.350
to divide up our possessions,

11:38.450 --> 11:41.150
he insisted on getting that just to spite me.

11:41.185 --> 11:42.250
Well,Mrs. Atherton,

11:42.350 --> 11:43.950
it seems as if your husband has done

11:44.050 --> 11:46.150
a lot more than that to spite you.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.250
You mean Mandy Felding?

11:47.350 --> 11:48.515
Yeah.

11:48.550 --> 11:51.250
No,I knew all about his "personal training. "

11:51.350 --> 11:53.450
It was quite obvious to me.

11:53.550 --> 11:55.050
You feeling up to a workout?

11:55.150 --> 11:58.150
Well,what kind of exercise do you have in mind?

11:58.250 --> 11:59.150
Naughty boy.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.650
(both giggling)

12:01.750 --> 12:03.200
So you decided to kill Mandy

12:03.235 --> 12:04.650
for sleeping with your husband?

12:04.750 --> 12:05.815
No.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.650
No,I destroyed his real mistress.

12:08.750 --> 12:09.850
His boat.

12:09.950 --> 12:12.050
But if you ask me,

12:12.150 --> 12:13.650
Hank probably killed Mandy

12:13.750 --> 12:18.050
because he was... quite rough sometimes.

12:18.150 --> 12:19.815
You mean sexually?

12:19.850 --> 12:21.950
Well,it was a while ago,but yes.

12:22.050 --> 12:23.950
Yes,he was.

13:02.450 --> 13:03.750
Hey.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.050
So Alexx said that you're running

13:05.150 --> 13:06.750
the semen sample from our vic,

13:06.850 --> 13:08.450
the one that she collected.

13:08.550 --> 13:09.715
As we speak.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.115
I think it might be Hank Atherton

13:11.150 --> 13:14.050
'cause after all,Mandy was his girlfriend.

13:14.150 --> 13:15.250
Mm... nope.

13:15.350 --> 13:16.650
I just ran him; it's not Hank.

13:16.750 --> 13:17.950
You're kidding.

13:18.050 --> 13:19.250
Wasn't a match,

13:19.350 --> 13:21.450
but it looks like CODIS knows who is.

13:24.850 --> 13:26.850
Todd Felding.

13:27.950 --> 13:30.300
Felding,as in our victim's last name.

13:30.335 --> 13:32.615
Looks like Mandy had a bad marriage,too.

13:32.650 --> 13:34.250
I'll call patrol,have them bring in her husband.

13:34.350 --> 13:35.350
Thanks.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.750
We found

13:47.850 --> 13:51.050
your DNA on the body of the victim.

13:51.150 --> 13:53.350
Body of your victim?

13:53.450 --> 13:54.950
She's my wife.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.900
When was the last time you saw your wife?

13:57.935 --> 14:00.750
This morning before I went to the gym.

14:00.850 --> 14:03.350
You do a little construction down there?

14:05.950 --> 14:09.250
Yes,you have drywall debris on your shoulder.

14:09.350 --> 14:10.550
(scoffs)

14:10.650 --> 14:12.150
That could have come from anywhere.

14:12.250 --> 14:16.050
So if I take a sample of it,it won't match our crime scene?

14:19.550 --> 14:22.450
Okay.

14:22.550 --> 14:25.350
I followed Mandy to her client's house.

14:26.650 --> 14:28.650
I saw what was really going on.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.750
(music playing)

14:37.550 --> 14:40.050
What does she think she's doing out there?

14:45.650 --> 14:47.850
How could you do this to me?

14:49.350 --> 14:51.450
Todd.

14:56.750 --> 15:00.650
I thought we was trying to fix our marriage,

15:00.685 --> 15:04.550
but it looks like I was the only one trying.

15:04.650 --> 15:07.550
I guess there's no fixing it now,huh?

15:07.650 --> 15:10.350
Take him,Officer.

15:24.450 --> 15:25.650
Hey.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.750
You.

15:28.650 --> 15:30.550
Got something for me?

15:30.650 --> 15:32.250
Should I?

15:32.285 --> 15:33.850
Yeah.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.550
Did we meet somewhere?

15:35.650 --> 15:38.050
Am I supposed to be taking you out on a lunch date?

15:38.150 --> 15:39.950
Ha-ha,very funny.

15:39.985 --> 15:41.750
Where's my check?

15:41.850 --> 15:43.250
Your check?

15:44.550 --> 15:45.950
I don't even know you.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.750
Eric,could I speak to you for just a minute?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.450
Excuse us.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.450
Unfortunately,you do know her.

16:00.550 --> 16:03.250
Right before the accident,you helped her out and she sued you.

16:03.350 --> 16:04.715
Sued me for what?

16:04.750 --> 16:05.950
I'll explain it to you later,

16:06.050 --> 16:08.050
but you didn't do anything wrong.

16:08.150 --> 16:09.350
Eric,you've got the shoeprint

16:09.450 --> 16:11.050
from the Lamborghini to process.

16:11.085 --> 16:12.350
So...

16:12.450 --> 16:14.250
how about you take that and I'll handle her?

16:14.350 --> 16:15.500
Yeah,okay.

16:15.535 --> 16:16.650
Thanks.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.750
What's Officer Delko trying to pull?

16:26.850 --> 16:28.450
Pretending like he doesn't recognize me.

16:28.550 --> 16:30.750
Look,Carmen,you're gonna get your check.

16:30.850 --> 16:32.950
It's just that Delko has been out on medical leave

16:33.050 --> 16:34.950
and his paycheck garnishment hasn't kicked in yet.

16:34.985 --> 16:36.650
Medical? For what?

16:36.750 --> 16:38.250
That's none of your business.

16:38.350 --> 16:39.250
Will it affect

16:39.350 --> 16:40.650
my settlement?

16:40.750 --> 16:43.650
If you'll excuse me,I need to get back to my job.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.850
Some of us work for a living.

17:05.349 --> 17:06.349
PAUL: Damn.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.650
That's quite a nasty arm.

17:16.450 --> 17:17.815
Mr. Warner.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.849
Local ER tells us that,uh,

17:19.950 --> 17:22.150
you checked yourself in for fire ant bites?

17:22.250 --> 17:24.550
I fell on an anthill. Nothing serious.

17:24.650 --> 17:26.550
I don't agree.

17:26.650 --> 17:28.550
I have a warrant here.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.550
It's for your shoes.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.250
My shoes?

17:33.350 --> 17:34.515
Oh,yeah.

17:34.550 --> 17:35.950
We found a shoeprint

17:36.050 --> 17:38.850
in the Athertons' Lamborghini,and that...

17:38.950 --> 17:40.115
was at a crime scene.

17:40.150 --> 17:42.050
And if we can match it to your shoe,

17:42.085 --> 17:43.150
we've got you for murder.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.150
I guess I need a lawyer then.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.150
Oh,I'm sure

17:46.250 --> 17:47.650
the court can appoint you one.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.315
There's no need.

17:49.350 --> 17:50.450
I've already got one.

17:50.550 --> 17:51.815
Stacey Wakeman.

17:51.850 --> 17:55.350
That's Mrs. Atherton's attorney.

17:55.385 --> 17:57.350
Let's just say she owes me.

17:57.385 --> 17:58.450
I have no doubt.

18:09.450 --> 18:12.450
That dust lift you collected is pristine.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.850
Thanks.

18:13.950 --> 18:17.450
I'm comparing it against the pool boy's shoes.

18:17.485 --> 18:19.050
These must be his favorite pair.

18:19.150 --> 18:20.750
They've got a nice wear pattern.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.150
Is it unique enough

18:22.185 --> 18:23.850
for a match?

18:23.950 --> 18:26.350
All right,I'll tell you what.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.650
Why don't you tell me?

18:32.650 --> 18:35.415
That's a match.

18:35.450 --> 18:38.050
We got him for killing our Lamborghini guy.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.250
Yeah.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.050
Calleigh,

18:41.150 --> 18:42.150
I wanted to thank you.

18:43.350 --> 18:45.250
For taking care of that girl today.

18:45.350 --> 18:46.750
It's no problem.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.950
You would've done the same thing for me.

18:49.050 --> 18:50.350
Yeah.

18:51.450 --> 18:52.615
It's just that

18:52.650 --> 18:54.115
you helped me out a lot this year.

18:54.150 --> 18:56.750
Well,I appreciate you for appreciating me.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.150
What was that all about?

19:12.250 --> 19:13.650
Nothing.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.815
What's up?

19:14.850 --> 19:16.750
This just came for you.

19:16.850 --> 19:19.250
We got a courtesy copy of this motion.

19:21.850 --> 19:23.750
The pool boy's lawyer filed a motion

19:23.850 --> 19:25.950
for an expedited Frye hearing on this case.

19:27.850 --> 19:29.115
It's for today.

19:29.150 --> 19:30.550
Yeah,but how can they challenge our procedures?

19:30.585 --> 19:31.915
All of our manuals are in order.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.050
They were reviewed during accreditation.

19:34.150 --> 19:36.450
There's another part to a Frye hearing-

19:36.485 --> 19:38.550
the competency of the analyst.

19:41.450 --> 19:43.750
<i>They're coming after me. Personally.</i>

20:03.550 --> 20:05.515
I looked into your public records.

20:05.550 --> 20:07.750
Only a few weeks before you were shot on duty,

20:07.850 --> 20:08.850
you were being sued.

20:08.950 --> 20:10.450
Isn't that right,Mr. Delko?

20:10.550 --> 20:11.650
That's correct.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.650
What event led to this suit?

20:14.750 --> 20:16.650
I was helping a civilian in danger.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.850
Can you elaborate for the court?

20:22.950 --> 20:24.950
I can't remember all of the details.

20:25.050 --> 20:27.050
You can't remember a lot of things,

20:27.085 --> 20:28.350
isn't that correct,Mr. Delko?

20:28.450 --> 20:30.450
I do have some memory loss,

20:30.485 --> 20:32.450
pre-shooting,that's all.

20:32.485 --> 20:33.415
Mr. Delko,

20:33.450 --> 20:35.215
your memory lapses are

20:35.250 --> 20:38.250
directly related to the brain injury you sustained

20:38.285 --> 20:41.250
when you were shot a few months ago. Isn't that right?

20:41.285 --> 20:44.050
You're making it sound like I can't do my job.

20:44.150 --> 20:45.350
Yes,I have

20:45.450 --> 20:47.150
some memory loss,but it's specific

20:47.250 --> 20:48.650
to the few months before the shooting,

20:48.750 --> 20:50.450
and that's all. Upon your return to work,

20:50.485 --> 20:52.015
were you given new proficiencies?

20:52.050 --> 20:54.850
Or was anyone assigned to monitor your casework

20:54.950 --> 20:56.150
since you've returned?

20:56.650 --> 20:58.050
No.

20:58.150 --> 21:01.400
So you just came back and resumed your duties

21:01.435 --> 21:04.650
without anyone determining your competency.

21:06.250 --> 21:09.250
I followed every protocol and procedure in this case.

21:09.285 --> 21:11.550
Every single one.

21:11.650 --> 21:15.150
And the crime scene footprint matches your client's shoe.

21:15.250 --> 21:16.415
You saw someone today

21:16.450 --> 21:18.050
that you should have been very familiar with,

21:18.150 --> 21:19.650
and yet did not recognize.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.350
Isn't that true,Mr. Delko?

21:23.350 --> 21:24.750
Yes.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.250
Mr. Delko,isn't this the woman you saw today?

21:30.050 --> 21:31.950
Hey. You.

21:32.050 --> 21:33.715
Yes.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.350
She was the one who originated the lawsuit

21:36.450 --> 21:37.750
which resulted in you choosing

21:37.850 --> 21:39.850
to have your wages garnished as settlement?

21:39.885 --> 21:40.850
So I've been told.

21:40.885 --> 21:41.815
Your Honor,

21:41.850 --> 21:43.150
please note for the record

21:43.250 --> 21:44.950
Mr. Delko has identified Carmen Henney.

21:45.050 --> 21:46.350
So noted.

21:48.050 --> 21:49.950
Your Honor,this criminalist

21:50.050 --> 21:53.150
sustained a severe brain injury only four months ago.

21:53.185 --> 21:54.315
He has memory lapses

21:54.350 --> 21:55.850
(words repeating): and is currently working

21:55.950 --> 21:58.950
major crime scenes without supervision.

21:59.050 --> 22:02.150
I move that any evidence collected by this man be thrown out,

22:02.185 --> 22:03.750
specifically,my client's so-called shoeprint,

22:03.850 --> 22:07.250
which was processed by Mr. Delko today.

22:09.150 --> 22:11.115
I'm going to continue this hearing

22:11.150 --> 22:13.150
pending the testimony of Mr. Delko's doctor.

22:15.950 --> 22:18.415
Until then,Mr. Delko,

22:18.450 --> 22:20.950
I strongly recommend that you not

22:21.050 --> 22:23.850
process any evidentiary material in this matter.

22:33.850 --> 22:35.350
So,desk duty,right?

22:35.450 --> 22:37.150
For now.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.850
The State Attorney

22:38.950 --> 22:41.350
won't even admit the shoeprint evidence.

22:41.450 --> 22:43.850
Says he can't afford to have me discredited on the stand.

22:43.885 --> 22:47.050
Eric,we just need to be patient.

22:47.150 --> 22:49.350
The shoeprint evidence is the only thing tying

22:49.450 --> 22:50.850
the pool boy to the Lamborghini murder.

22:50.950 --> 22:52.150
He could get away with it.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.550
That will never happen.

23:07.650 --> 23:09.615
Hey.

23:09.650 --> 23:11.150
You know you didn't do anything wrong.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.715
That lawyer's sleazy.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.550
They're using you as a scapegoat for her client.

23:14.650 --> 23:16.750
Everything Wakeman said was true.

23:16.850 --> 23:19.450
There's truth,and then there's relevance.

23:19.550 --> 23:20.650
Look,all I know is

23:20.750 --> 23:22.350
we I lost a key piece of evidence

23:22.450 --> 23:23.750
that could have convicted the pool boy.

23:23.850 --> 23:25.450
You heard Horatio. We know he killed Lockwood.

23:25.485 --> 23:26.850
All we have to do is find another way.

23:26.950 --> 23:29.250
No,you need to find another way.

23:29.350 --> 23:31.250
I'm on desk duty.

23:31.350 --> 23:32.850
Looks like a desk to me.

23:32.950 --> 23:34.115
(chuckles)

23:34.150 --> 23:35.850
Besides,have you got something?

23:35.950 --> 23:38.550
Yeah,the pool boy's arm.

23:38.650 --> 23:39.950
Look at the ant bites.

23:40.050 --> 23:41.650
You mean,how they only go halfway up his arm?

23:41.750 --> 23:42.750
That's right.

23:42.850 --> 23:44.115
When we picked him up,

23:44.150 --> 23:45.615
he had a short-sleeve shirt on.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.600
The ants- it would have swarmed farther up his arms.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.550
You think maybe he was wearing something over it

23:49.650 --> 23:50.550
when he killed him?

23:50.650 --> 23:52.250
Yeah,I think a jacket

23:52.350 --> 23:54.150
with elastic at the end of the sleeves.

23:54.185 --> 23:56.550
I bet I know where to find it.

24:22.950 --> 24:24.915
Bingo.

24:24.950 --> 24:27.150
(engine revving)

24:27.250 --> 24:28.550
(tires squealing)

24:33.850 --> 24:35.550
Hey,Nathan,what's going on?

24:35.585 --> 24:37.615
(panting)

24:37.650 --> 24:39.215
Mom's lawyer called.

24:39.250 --> 24:40.550
Some legal thing was lifted.

24:40.650 --> 24:42.350
You mean,like a court order?

24:42.385 --> 24:43.815
Yeah,something about

24:43.850 --> 24:45.250
it kept them from getting in the safe deposit box.

24:45.350 --> 24:46.250
I guess now they can.

24:46.350 --> 24:48.050
Are both their names on the box?

24:48.150 --> 24:50.350
Yeah. Yeah,divorce law states

24:50.450 --> 24:51.750
that whoever gets there first,gets what's inside.

24:51.785 --> 24:53.350
Yeah,well,if my mom got the call,

24:53.450 --> 24:55.050
Dad will show up there too,'cause their lawyers are

24:55.085 --> 24:56.515
almost as competitive as they are.

24:56.550 --> 24:59.250
I think they really might kill each other this time.

25:03.050 --> 25:06.650
Hey,Ryan,I need you to do me a favor.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.350
Get over to Miami National Bank.

25:08.450 --> 25:10.050
I think we might have a problem.

25:10.150 --> 25:13.150
(siren blaring)

25:18.850 --> 25:20.850
Laurie,come back here.

25:23.550 --> 25:25.150
Hank!

25:25.250 --> 25:26.150
Stop it! Give it.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.350
Give me,give me the box,Laurie.

25:27.385 --> 25:28.450
Stop it. Give me it.

25:28.550 --> 25:29.350
Give it to me.

25:29.385 --> 25:30.150
Let go,Hank.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.150
Stop it. Give me it.

25:31.185 --> 25:32.050
Give it to me. Stop it!

25:32.150 --> 25:34.050
Let go!

25:37.650 --> 25:39.350
(sighs)

25:41.250 --> 25:42.250
It's empty.

25:42.350 --> 25:43.350
Oh,you're kidding me.

25:43.450 --> 25:44.550
You're fighting over this?

25:44.650 --> 25:46.050
You stole it already? Oh,right,right.

25:46.085 --> 25:47.415
I stole everything.

25:47.450 --> 25:48.550
That's why I raced all the way down here.

25:48.650 --> 25:49.550
What did you do with all our stuff?

25:49.650 --> 25:51.550
Okay,Mr. Atherton,

25:51.585 --> 25:53.450
that's enough.

25:53.550 --> 25:54.715
You're under arrest

25:54.750 --> 25:56.450
for assault,destruction of property,

25:56.550 --> 25:57.650
and disturbing the peace.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.050
Throw the book at him,officer.

25:59.150 --> 26:02.050
Mrs. Atherton,book's going to hit you,too.

26:10.150 --> 26:12.350
WOLFE: I got to talk to these people.

26:12.450 --> 26:15.650
Okay,I'm going to need a list

26:15.750 --> 26:18.250
of all the things that you kept in that safe deposit box.

26:18.350 --> 26:20.150
And does anyone else have a key to it?

26:20.250 --> 26:22.050
Don't answer that,Laurie.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.750
You talk to my lawyer.

26:26.850 --> 26:28.150
She handles everything.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.250
(exhaling)

26:31.350 --> 26:32.750
Camden,you gotta fix this,man.

26:32.850 --> 26:34.350
It's just a big misunderstanding.

26:34.450 --> 26:35.950
We've got a bigger problem.

26:36.050 --> 26:38.450
This morning's unplanned activity on the boat

26:38.485 --> 26:40.050
ate significantly into your funds.

26:40.150 --> 26:43.015
So,my safe deposit box has been robbed.

26:43.050 --> 26:45.150
And now you're telling me my retainer's gone?

26:45.185 --> 26:47.250
LAWYER: Financially,you've hit bottom.

26:47.350 --> 26:49.850
And unless I receive additional funds,I will have

26:49.885 --> 26:50.950
to sever my services.

26:51.050 --> 26:51.915
As will I.

26:51.950 --> 26:53.950
What? Mine,too?

26:54.050 --> 26:56.350
WOLFE: You know,I'm sure the,uh,

26:56.385 --> 26:57.650
the state will be happy

26:57.750 --> 26:59.250
to provide you with a public defender.

26:59.350 --> 27:00.550
You've got to be kidding me.

27:00.650 --> 27:01.750
Hank.

27:01.850 --> 27:03.350
There is another way.

27:04.550 --> 27:06.350
Transfer ownership of your residence.

27:07.850 --> 27:10.350
LAWYER: It'll be held in a trust pending payment

27:10.450 --> 27:12.250
for future services.

27:12.350 --> 27:14.450
Equally divided between myself

27:14.550 --> 27:15.850
and Attorney Wakeman.

27:15.950 --> 27:17.350
Wait,what,

27:17.450 --> 27:18.515
what does this mean?

27:18.550 --> 27:20.450
Means that either you,uh,

27:20.550 --> 27:22.050
hand over the deed to your house

27:22.085 --> 27:23.350
as collateral

27:23.450 --> 27:24.350
or you're going to spend the night with us.

27:24.450 --> 27:25.650
That's blackmail.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.215
Once I file this paperwork,

27:27.250 --> 27:28.850
I'll have you released within the hour.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.150
You guys can take them down to the station.

27:38.250 --> 27:39.550
I'll meet you there,okay?

27:41.250 --> 27:42.850
Do we have to ride together?

27:42.885 --> 27:44.250
Don't worry.

27:44.350 --> 27:46.150
You'll be out within the hour.

28:11.350 --> 28:13.250
Hey,I got your call.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.250
Hopefully,you got something that can bail us out.

28:15.350 --> 28:17.250
Yeah,I found a piece of tissue

28:17.350 --> 28:19.350
caught in pool boy's jacket zipper.

28:19.385 --> 28:21.650
Take a look.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.715
That's beautiful.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.850
Skin probably tore off during the scuffle.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.750
(groaning)

28:32.950 --> 28:34.250
Let's hope it has our victim's DNA.

28:34.285 --> 28:35.750
I'm all over it.

28:35.850 --> 28:36.750
Thanks.

28:41.450 --> 28:43.950
So,Mr. Warner,

28:44.050 --> 28:46.050
I don't see your attorney.

28:47.650 --> 28:49.615
She did what I needed her to do.

28:49.650 --> 28:51.950
Proved that your guy was incompetent.

28:51.985 --> 28:53.150
(chuckles)

28:55.250 --> 28:57.850
So,why's Laurie gonna keep paying her $500 an hour

28:57.885 --> 28:59.450
when I had nothing to do

28:59.550 --> 29:00.815
with the safe deposit box?

29:00.850 --> 29:02.450
Do you have anything to do with...

29:03.650 --> 29:05.350
...that?

29:05.450 --> 29:07.950
It's my jacket.

29:07.985 --> 29:09.050
So?

29:09.150 --> 29:11.750
The victim's flesh is trapped

29:11.850 --> 29:13.550
in the zipper of that jacket.

29:14.650 --> 29:17.215
Mr. Warner,this is your chance

29:17.250 --> 29:19.650
to help yourself; I suggest you take it.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.550
She promised the car to me.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.550
And then she sold it to somebody else.

29:30.650 --> 29:32.550
I couldn't believe that she did that.

29:32.650 --> 29:34.350
So,yeah,I went after him.

29:34.450 --> 29:36.150
You're dreaming,kid. Get lost.

29:36.185 --> 29:37.850
You can't have this car,man.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.250
I'm not letting you drive away with it.

29:39.285 --> 29:40.650
Yeah,well,you're going to have to.

29:42.750 --> 29:45.250
(grunting and groaning)

29:49.750 --> 29:50.450
(groans)

30:03.450 --> 30:05.550
MAN: Hey! What's going on?

30:05.650 --> 30:08.650
I just wanted what was rightfully mine.

30:08.750 --> 30:11.615
She should have kept that car for me!

30:11.650 --> 30:14.750
And you,Mr. Warner,should have kept your lawyer.

30:23.450 --> 30:24.650
Why would I want anything

30:24.750 --> 30:26.150
out of my parent's safe deposit box?

30:26.250 --> 30:27.450
There's nothing in it for me.

30:27.550 --> 30:29.350
Someone completely cleaned it out,Nathan:

30:29.450 --> 30:30.650
valuables,cash,

30:30.750 --> 30:32.115
bearer bonds.

30:32.150 --> 30:33.750
Well,the bank has security,doesn't it?

30:33.850 --> 30:35.315
Check the cameras.

30:35.350 --> 30:38.550
Your parents said that you had access to the box.

30:38.585 --> 30:41.015
That's in case they,like,died or something.

30:41.050 --> 30:43.650
The last thing I need to do is create more drama.

30:43.750 --> 30:44.850
Heaven knows

30:44.950 --> 30:46.750
my parents are pretty damn good at that.

30:50.750 --> 30:53.815
Who the hell's that?

30:53.850 --> 30:56.050
You might have to move out,Nathan.

30:56.150 --> 30:57.350
Move out of the house?

30:57.450 --> 30:59.550
Yes,your parents had legal fees

30:59.650 --> 31:01.750
and in order to retain legal counsel,they had

31:01.850 --> 31:03.350
to put the house up as collateral.

31:03.385 --> 31:06.250
And I'm only 17.

31:06.350 --> 31:08.750
There's a representative from Child Services

31:08.850 --> 31:10.550
and she's going to talk to you about different options.

31:10.650 --> 31:12.215
There has to be some other way.

31:12.250 --> 31:14.450
I will be 18 in two weeks. That's a legal adult,right?

31:14.485 --> 31:18.115
Okay,what about this?

31:18.150 --> 31:19.650
Why don't we go to one of your parents' lawyers

31:19.750 --> 31:22.350
and talk to them?

31:22.385 --> 31:24.950
My dad's is closest.

31:24.985 --> 31:26.215
Allen Comden.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.050
Maybe he can figure out something you can do

31:28.085 --> 31:29.150
in the next two weeks.

31:36.850 --> 31:38.950
(phone ringing)

31:42.150 --> 31:43.650
(elevator bell dings)

31:47.750 --> 31:49.850
Secretary must have left for the day.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.650
Mr. Comden?

31:56.150 --> 31:57.850
Stay back.

31:57.950 --> 31:58.950
Mr. Comden?

31:59.050 --> 32:02.850
(gasping): Help... me...

32:02.950 --> 32:05.750
Call 911. He's been stabbed.

32:05.850 --> 32:07.950
Mr. Comden,I'm going to lift your head.

32:08.050 --> 32:09.550
(dialing tones)

32:09.650 --> 32:11.250
Okay,hang in there.

32:11.350 --> 32:14.250
Hang in there. Hang in there.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.450
Can you breathe?

32:16.550 --> 32:18.650
Yeah,we need an ambulance right away.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.150
A man's been stabbed pretty bad.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.250
Mr. Comden?

32:24.150 --> 32:25.750
(Comden exhales)

32:25.850 --> 32:28.850
9542 Willowbrook Avenue.

32:38.350 --> 32:39.750
He's gone.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.300
What is going on?

32:44.335 --> 32:47.350
I don't know.

33:04.050 --> 33:07.150
CAINE: You know,you were the last one to see Comden alive.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.050
Fortunately for me,that doesn't prove murder.

33:10.085 --> 33:12.750
With Comden out of the way,you get

33:12.850 --> 33:14.150
the Atherton house,don't you?

33:14.250 --> 33:16.350
Look,I was at a deposition all afternoon.

33:16.450 --> 33:17.850
You can check the transcripts.

33:17.950 --> 33:20.350
You should be looking at the family.

33:20.450 --> 33:22.650
Explain that,please.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.850
Lori and Hank- not exactly honest people.

33:25.950 --> 33:27.050
He's hiding money in the Caymans.

33:27.150 --> 33:28.850
She's got Swiss bank accounts.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.850
Ma'am...

33:34.050 --> 33:38.215
You just betrayed your own clients.

33:38.250 --> 33:42.800
I'm offering you details to help you find a killer.

33:42.835 --> 33:47.315
I don't think the state bar's going to see it that way.

33:47.350 --> 33:52.550
What is this- revenge because I went after one or your CSIs?

33:52.650 --> 33:55.750
Here's the difference between you and me,counselor.

33:55.850 --> 33:59.450
The difference is,I have a case.

33:59.550 --> 34:01.850
Talk to my lawyer.

34:01.950 --> 34:05.350
Who's gonna represent you,ma'am?

34:09.449 --> 34:11.449
So can I go home?

34:11.550 --> 34:14.750
No,not yet.

34:14.850 --> 34:18.050
We've not recovered the murder weapon and

34:18.150 --> 34:19.449
until we search the house,

34:19.550 --> 34:20.850
you're still a person of interest.

34:20.949 --> 34:22.514
My parents,too?

34:22.550 --> 34:24.750
Yes. Trust me. We are looking into them.

34:24.850 --> 34:27.350
This is the third murder they've been connected to today.

34:27.385 --> 34:29.949
You may not believe it,officer,but

34:29.985 --> 34:33.150
they were happy before.

34:33.250 --> 34:35.850
Nathan,did you think if you killed the lawyer,

34:35.885 --> 34:37.949
your parents would get back together?

34:37.985 --> 34:39.715
I would never kill anyone.

34:39.750 --> 34:42.750
I just wish things would be back to the way they used to.

34:42.850 --> 34:45.750
Unfortunately,it's too late for that.

34:45.850 --> 34:49.850
Here...

34:51.750 --> 34:53.750
Search all you want.

34:53.850 --> 34:56.150
I didn't do anything.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.050
That deactivator may help you.

34:58.150 --> 35:01.550
Okay. We're gonna have Bill walk you out.

35:10.850 --> 35:13.050
Well,I haven't seen that smile for a while.

35:13.150 --> 35:15.250
Horatio's having Wakeman disbarred.

35:16.850 --> 35:18.450
Means I'm green-lit to go back in the field.

35:18.485 --> 35:19.915
Well,all right.

35:19.950 --> 35:21.650
Grab your kit. We're going to the Atherton house,

35:21.685 --> 35:23.650
see if we can find the murder weapon.

35:49.050 --> 35:50.815
We've searched the whole house.

35:50.850 --> 35:54.150
No signs of any sharp objects that would match Comden's wound.

35:54.250 --> 35:56.650
Why would Nathan give me the deactivator

35:56.685 --> 35:58.950
if the lasers are off?

35:59.050 --> 36:00.015
(beeps)

36:00.050 --> 36:01.550
(alarm sounding)

36:01.650 --> 36:02.650
Whoa.

36:04.550 --> 36:05.750
Hey.

36:05.785 --> 36:06.915
Hang on.

36:06.950 --> 36:08.150
Laser's been redirected.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.050
(beeps,alarm stops)

36:23.750 --> 36:25.150
Got a bloody knife.

36:30.150 --> 36:32.250
Looks like there's a good print on it.

36:34.250 --> 36:36.650
Well,that's definitely gonna sink one of the Athertons.

36:38.850 --> 36:40.250
Your prints were on the knife

36:40.285 --> 36:41.650
that killed Allen Camden.

36:41.750 --> 36:43.115
Okay,I may have...

36:43.150 --> 36:45.350
I may have fantasized about killing the guy,

36:45.450 --> 36:46.850
but I didn't do it.

36:48.850 --> 36:51.250
You made a little blood donation

36:51.350 --> 36:53.150
on the knife that was used to kill him.

36:53.250 --> 36:56.350
Oh,the cake knife from my wedding.

36:56.450 --> 36:58.450
I used it the other day to make some steaks.

36:58.485 --> 36:59.415
I cut my finger.

36:59.450 --> 37:02.050
Do you recognize this?

37:03.550 --> 37:04.950
I do.

37:05.050 --> 37:06.550
This is the knife from my wedding.

37:06.650 --> 37:08.250
But of course I touched it.

37:08.350 --> 37:10.350
You were cutting meat with a cake knife.

37:10.385 --> 37:11.750
Yeah.

37:11.850 --> 37:14.950
Guess who's hording my $3,000 steak knives,

37:14.985 --> 37:16.450
and she's a vegetarian.

37:16.550 --> 37:18.550
Okay,so you're saying that the print on this knife

37:18.650 --> 37:19.550
is from your wedding?

37:19.650 --> 37:21.450
I haven't used it since.

37:22.450 --> 37:23.815
Talk to Hank.

37:23.850 --> 37:26.550
<i>You know the book The Art of War?</i>

37:26.585 --> 37:29.250
It's like a divorce manual. Read up.

37:29.350 --> 37:30.715
I know who did it.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.650
I'll give you three guesses,and they all start

37:32.750 --> 37:34.315
with Laurie.

37:34.350 --> 37:35.915
And what makes you so sure,Hank?

37:35.950 --> 37:39.050
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

37:39.150 --> 37:40.350
Do you have any proof

37:40.450 --> 37:41.750
that Hank could have done this?

37:41.850 --> 37:42.915
I don't need proof.

37:42.950 --> 37:44.550
I was married to the guy for 19 years,

37:44.585 --> 37:47.467
so I know what he's capable of.

37:47.502 --> 37:50.350
<i>HANK: Look,are we done here?</i>

37:50.450 --> 37:52.850
I need to find a new lawyer.

37:53.850 --> 37:56.050
(sighs)

37:58.150 --> 37:59.515
So?

37:59.550 --> 38:00.750
So Hank denies

38:00.850 --> 38:01.750
any involvement at all.

38:01.850 --> 38:03.015
He puts it all on his wife.

38:03.050 --> 38:05.050
And,of course,she puts it all on him.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.550
So we can't hand this

38:06.585 --> 38:07.950
into the State Attorney

38:08.050 --> 38:09.250
without sorting it out.

38:09.350 --> 38:11.050
Let me see that file for a minute,Eric.

38:16.150 --> 38:19.050
Do you see what I see?

38:29.650 --> 38:32.550
It's the earrings from the safe deposit box.

38:32.650 --> 38:33.715
Yes,they are.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.850
And it would be my guess...

38:36.850 --> 38:38.550
that he's wearing the watch.

38:41.450 --> 38:42.750
DELKO: So they were pretty smart.

38:42.850 --> 38:45.250
Put it on each other and create reasonable doubt.

38:45.350 --> 38:47.250
And now they're arrogant enough to wear the jewelry?

38:47.350 --> 38:49.750
Looks that way.

38:50.550 --> 38:52.350
Excuse me.

38:53.550 --> 38:55.650
This way,please.

38:57.450 --> 39:00.250
I thought we were being released,Lieutenant.

39:00.350 --> 39:01.415
Actually,folks,

39:01.450 --> 39:03.350
there's been a change in plans.

39:05.750 --> 39:08.350
Here's what I think happened.

39:08.450 --> 39:12.350
I think your lawyer robbed your safe deposit box,

39:12.385 --> 39:14.850
and you killed him for it.

39:16.650 --> 39:20.550
We filed a police report for the stolen items,and you

39:20.585 --> 39:22.050
are wearing the earrings.

39:23.850 --> 39:26.950
And you are wearing the watch,Mr. Atherton.

39:36.750 --> 39:39.015
These earrings...

39:39.050 --> 39:42.250
were the first gift that Hank ever bought me.

39:43.650 --> 39:47.150
She gave me this watch on our first anniversary.

39:49.250 --> 39:52.850
I believe the turning point was at the bank.

39:57.450 --> 39:58.750
Our house! Our house!

39:58.785 --> 40:00.050
Can you believe this?

40:00.150 --> 40:01.850
We should have just split

40:01.950 --> 40:04.450
everything up ourselves like we wanted.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.950
You stole from the safe deposit box.

40:06.985 --> 40:10.150
I didn't.

40:10.250 --> 40:13.450
I did give my lawyer

40:13.550 --> 40:15.350
temporary access a few weeks ago,

40:15.385 --> 40:17.250
just to itemize possessions.

40:17.350 --> 40:19.650
Comden ripped us off.

40:20.950 --> 40:23.350
Now he pretty much has everything we own.

40:23.450 --> 40:25.750
On top of what I paid him.

40:25.850 --> 40:29.250
Well,I think he owes us a refund.

40:29.350 --> 40:31.150
Don't you?

40:31.250 --> 40:33.250
I do.

40:33.350 --> 40:35.750
So you paid Allen a visit.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.850
We wanted him to tear up the papers he made us sign

40:38.950 --> 40:40.950
and get our stuff back.

40:41.050 --> 40:42.850
Then he walked in on us.

40:45.550 --> 40:47.750
You see it?

40:47.850 --> 40:49.115
No.

40:49.150 --> 40:51.450
He must still have it in his briefcase.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.950
What are we gonna do?

40:55.550 --> 40:56.850
What are you two doing here?

40:56.950 --> 40:59.450
Waiting for you,Allen.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.750
You stole from us,Allen.

41:02.850 --> 41:05.450
Where's the stuff from our safe deposit box?

41:05.550 --> 41:10.150
I was just keeping this until we could divide it up.

41:10.185 --> 41:12.017
I've got the cash,got the bonds.

41:12.052 --> 41:13.850
I've been keeping your jewelry,

41:13.950 --> 41:15.450
your watch...

41:17.750 --> 41:21.050
And what's this?

41:21.150 --> 41:24.150
The cake knife from our wedding.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.150
So... who's gonna get it?

41:30.450 --> 41:32.250
You are.

41:34.250 --> 41:35.950
(grunts)

41:47.050 --> 41:50.050
That house was the first thing we bought together.

41:50.150 --> 41:52.950
CAINE: Well,I suggest you cherish the memories.

41:52.985 --> 41:55.950
Because you're never gonna see it again.

41:56.050 --> 41:57.950
Officer.

42:08.550 --> 42:10.550
(car alarm chirps)

42:10.585 --> 42:11.750
Hey,Nathan.

42:12.750 --> 42:14.050
Hey,Nathan,

42:14.150 --> 42:16.450
you wanted us to find that knife,didn't you?

42:16.550 --> 42:20.450
It was the only way that they would stay apart forever.

42:20.550 --> 42:23.150
Too many people got hurt because of them.

42:25.250 --> 42:28.915
You know...

42:28.950 --> 42:32.550
my mom and dad spent all their time

42:32.650 --> 42:33.750
fighting over their possessions,

42:33.785 --> 42:34.750
but never once

42:34.850 --> 42:37.150
did they fight over me.

42:45.750 --> 42:47.050
(engine starts)
