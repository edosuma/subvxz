WEBVTT

00:05.632 --> 00:08.631
Oh. Morning.

00:08.632 --> 00:10.362
Morning.

00:11.802 --> 00:14.631
Don't miss the trade agreement. Page three.

00:14.632 --> 00:17.812
It's finally happening.

00:25.302 --> 00:26.421
Uh-oh.

00:26.422 --> 00:28.261
More than three of you.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.301
It's not bad news.

00:29.302 --> 00:31.301
We just have a few things
to discuss with you.

00:31.302 --> 00:33.011
For your trip to Myanmar.

00:33.012 --> 00:35.591
You're only the third secretary
of state to visit in 50 years,

00:35.592 --> 00:36.429
you know.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.844
And the first who gets to sign
the Pacific Rim Trade Agreement.

00:38.845 --> 00:40.171
Boom.

00:40.172 --> 00:41.591
I'm just experimenting with that.

00:41.592 --> 00:43.341
"Boom" is over, man. You missed it.

00:43.342 --> 00:44.711
Daisy, what's up with page three?

00:44.712 --> 00:46.131
Why isn't it bigger news than that?

00:46.132 --> 00:48.131
Believe me, when you sign the agreement,

00:48.132 --> 00:49.591
it'll be front page, above the fold.

00:49.592 --> 00:53.421
There is just one small
fly in the ointment.

00:53.422 --> 00:54.421
I can't believe I kicked that football.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.841
The meet and greet at the elevator...

00:55.842 --> 00:57.631
always bad news.

00:57.632 --> 00:58.631
Who's the fly?

00:58.632 --> 01:00.091
Ambassador Arlen Maxwell.

01:00.092 --> 01:01.257
In my office?

01:01.258 --> 01:02.421
No, in Myanmar.

01:02.422 --> 01:03.801
He's called a few times today.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.261
He has some ethical concerns
about the trade agreement.

01:06.262 --> 01:07.591
He does?

01:07.592 --> 01:10.591
Yes. The U.S. ambassador to Myanmar,

01:10.592 --> 01:14.261
whose job it is to represent
U.S. interests in Myanmar,

01:14.262 --> 01:17.841
has some ethical concerns about
the landmark trade agreement.

01:17.842 --> 01:20.091
Upon which everyone has agreed.

01:20.092 --> 01:22.011
You know, I've spoken to him a few times.

01:22.012 --> 01:24.131
He seems reasonable enough.

01:24.132 --> 01:26.134
- What's going on?
- I think the ambassador might have

01:26.135 --> 01:28.631
something referred to as clientitis.

01:28.632 --> 01:30.471
He's identifying closely

01:30.472 --> 01:32.381
with the culture and its people.

01:32.382 --> 01:35.421
Let's nip it in the bud, and...

01:35.422 --> 01:37.011
Blake, get me the ambassador, will you?

01:37.012 --> 01:40.011
So, is there anything
else that I should know?

01:40.012 --> 01:44.421
Yes. He and President Dalton
have been friends since college.

01:44.422 --> 01:47.131
Maxwell inherited a large sum of money

01:47.336 --> 01:50.438
and invested it in some
high-risk enterprises.

01:50.439 --> 01:51.706
One of them paid off.

01:51.707 --> 01:54.126
A very deep gold mine in Argentina.

01:54.127 --> 01:55.826
Now, word is, he got lucky.

01:55.827 --> 01:58.076
His wife divorced him two years ago.

01:58.077 --> 02:00.996
No prenup. Talk about
a very deep gold mine.

02:00.997 --> 02:03.746
So when the ambassadorship came
up, he called his old friend

02:03.747 --> 02:06.916
the president and asked
to be sent to Myanmar.

02:06.917 --> 02:09.209
- Maybe for a change of scenery?
- I'm guessing to escape

02:09.210 --> 02:11.076
the tabloids. Their divorce was

02:11.077 --> 02:12.076
a splashy story.

02:12.077 --> 02:14.166
To be fair to the president,

02:14.167 --> 02:16.746
a number of candidates
turned down the post.

02:16.747 --> 02:19.246
Myanmar is a very poor country
a long way from anything.

02:19.247 --> 02:21.579
- Unless you're a fan of temples.
- Look, there's no way

02:21.580 --> 02:23.916
this rube is gonna mess
up the trade agreement.

02:23.917 --> 02:26.036
I had to rewrite an entire Billy Joel song

02:26.037 --> 02:28.039
- just to make it happen.
- Yeah. And we had to sing it.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.079
- Don't you mean you got to sing it?
- Don't worry, Matt.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.166
It won't be for naught.

02:31.167 --> 02:33.076
This agreement is going to go through.

02:33.077 --> 02:33.852
Ambassador Maxwell.

02:33.853 --> 02:34.626
Great.

02:34.627 --> 02:35.295
Thanks, everybody.

02:35.296 --> 02:37.062
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

02:37.627 --> 02:40.036
Ambassador, I'm looking forward

02:40.037 --> 02:41.956
to meeting you in person
in the next couple of days.

02:41.957 --> 02:44.536
And I you, Madam Secretary.

02:44.537 --> 02:47.286
Uh, now, may I ask, have you...

02:47.287 --> 02:49.206
have you read, uh, this report

02:49.207 --> 02:50.996
put out by your State Department?

02:50.997 --> 02:53.166
Well, I-I have to be honest with you.

02:53.167 --> 02:56.916
The State Department puts
out thousands of documents,

02:56.917 --> 02:58.352
feels like every day.

02:58.353 --> 02:59.786
Well, this is called

02:59.787 --> 03:02.206
The World in 2030, and I just...

03:02.207 --> 03:05.206
I have to tell you,
it's not a pretty world,

03:05.207 --> 03:08.857
particularly for Myanmar, after
we sign this trade agreement.

03:08.858 --> 03:12.150
What in particular about the
trade agreement bothers you?

03:12.151 --> 03:14.947
Elimination of tariffs
on hydro-power turbines.

03:14.948 --> 03:16.527
Let's start there.

03:16.528 --> 03:19.067
Yes. So that hydroelectric
dams can be built,

03:19.068 --> 03:22.067
leading to the modernization
of Myanmar's power grid.

03:22.068 --> 03:26.897
At the cost of displacing
whole villages of people.

03:26.898 --> 03:29.817
People who have been
farmers all their lives.

03:29.818 --> 03:32.237
It's... it is all right in here.

03:32.238 --> 03:35.987
But with the modernization to
the cities, industry can thrive.

03:35.988 --> 03:39.567
And it will help close
the enormous wealth gap

03:39.568 --> 03:43.737
and, in turn, raise the
standard of living for everyone.

03:43.738 --> 03:46.027
We're talking about generations of people

03:46.028 --> 03:48.317
who have only lived close to the land.

03:48.318 --> 03:50.277
Ambassador Maxwell, I understand.

03:50.278 --> 03:53.187
This agreement, it isn't perfect,

03:53.188 --> 03:54.987
but at the end of the day,

03:54.988 --> 03:59.027
the positive effects clearly
outweighed the negative.

03:59.028 --> 04:02.357
Well, I can tell you, there
is a large segment of people

04:02.358 --> 04:04.987
who live here who do not agree.

04:04.988 --> 04:07.237
Even President Shwe, even he has concerns.

04:07.238 --> 04:11.067
Concerns that have been resolved
through hours of conversation

04:11.068 --> 04:13.317
and reviewing the data.

04:13.318 --> 04:16.219
President Shwe got on board
for a very good reason.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.147
If Conrad would call me back...

04:18.148 --> 04:20.817
President Dalton has entrusted
me with this agreement,

04:20.817 --> 04:24.317
but I assure you that he
is fully committed to it.

04:24.318 --> 04:25.987
And I promise you that this

04:25.988 --> 04:28.317
is an agreement that you can represent

04:28.318 --> 04:30.607
to the people of Myanmar proudly.

04:30.608 --> 04:32.527
See you then.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.027
I don't know how we missed this.

04:36.028 --> 04:37.147
We didn't.

04:37.148 --> 04:38.987
I read it when it came out.

04:38.988 --> 04:42.067
But probably just before I read
the joint CIA and FBI projection

04:42.068 --> 04:44.187
of the ten most imminent
terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.

04:44.188 --> 04:46.277
I do have to prioritize

04:46.278 --> 04:48.740
my end of the world documents, you know.

04:48.741 --> 04:50.777
It's somebody's job in every department

04:50.778 --> 04:52.107
to game out worst-case scenarios.

04:52.108 --> 04:54.107
It's not supposed to be
taken as hard science.

04:54.108 --> 04:59.107
Water is featured as a
megatrend starting on page 380.

04:59.108 --> 05:01.067
See, that's good. Write that down.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.027
We just... we just need
to remind the ambassador

05:04.028 --> 05:05.317
of the counterpoints.

05:05.318 --> 05:06.987
Why are we humoring this guy?

05:06.988 --> 05:09.317
Because these big trade
agreements are very fragile

05:09.318 --> 05:11.107
when you have so many countries involved.

05:11.108 --> 05:14.147
And the last thing we need
is a skittish ambassador.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.687
If his concerns get out
and they're taken as a sign

05:16.688 --> 05:18.357
that the United States has doubts,

05:18.358 --> 05:19.857
it could make others reevaluate,

05:19.858 --> 05:21.237
not to mention embarrass
the hell out of us.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.857
No kidding.

05:22.858 --> 05:25.357
"2030, nearly half the world's population

05:25.358 --> 05:28.527
will live in areas of severe water stress."

05:28.528 --> 05:31.067
The trade agreement is going to
allow us to send in scientists

05:31.068 --> 05:32.527
to help shore up erosion.

05:32.528 --> 05:34.737
It's all in the speech
I wrote for the ceremony.

05:34.738 --> 05:35.897
It's solid.

05:35.898 --> 05:37.317
We just need talking points

05:37.318 --> 05:39.027
to ease the ambassador's mind.

05:39.028 --> 05:40.317
Sure. No problem.

05:40.318 --> 05:41.220
I love that answer.

05:41.221 --> 05:42.137
Spider monkeys

05:42.138 --> 05:43.090
will be extinct?

05:43.091 --> 05:44.591
Somebody take that away from Blake.

05:47.761 --> 05:49.390
Hi, it's me.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.090
Uh, I called before, but
I didn't leave a message.

05:52.091 --> 05:54.510
Um, maybe you didn't recognize the number.

05:54.511 --> 05:56.970
So, it looks like

05:56.971 --> 06:00.300
I'm going to be in your
neck of the woods... soon.

06:00.301 --> 06:03.850
And, um, it would be very nice to see you.

06:03.851 --> 06:09.010
Anyway, I'll be there,
uh, day after tomorrow.

06:09.011 --> 06:11.550
And...

06:11.551 --> 06:15.090
I-I look forward to seeing you.

06:15.091 --> 06:18.611
Okay. Um... bye.

06:22.301 --> 06:23.571
Damn it.

06:24.511 --> 06:26.640
Oh, Madam Secretary!

06:26.641 --> 06:28.260
Listen, I'm just heading home.

06:28.261 --> 06:30.590
I need those, uh, talking
points e-mailed to me.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.220
But, um, or Jay can bring them tomorrow.

06:32.221 --> 06:34.350
Uh, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

06:34.351 --> 06:37.510
I'll be joining you on your
trip to Myanmar instead of Jay.

06:37.511 --> 06:39.680
Oh. Okay. But everything all right?

06:39.681 --> 06:41.010
Oh, it's fine.

06:41.011 --> 06:43.970
I just thought he could use a
break from all the traveling.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.050
The baby's teething... incisors.

06:46.051 --> 06:48.053
- It's painful.
- Yeah, those are the tough ones.

06:48.054 --> 06:49.593
- Yeah.
- What's the real reason?

06:51.511 --> 06:54.350
I recently found out that my son

06:54.351 --> 06:56.350
has been living in Myanmar
for the last few months.

06:56.351 --> 06:57.590
Your son?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.510
From a very brief affair when I was

06:59.511 --> 07:01.115
touring Europe with a dance troupe.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.470
Dance troupe?

07:02.471 --> 07:03.640
Before law school.

07:03.641 --> 07:07.090
Anyway, he quit Juilliard years ago

07:07.091 --> 07:08.640
and has been traveling around

07:08.641 --> 07:12.050
and wound up in Myanmar,
as luck would have it.

07:12.051 --> 07:13.850
You know, you and I really should have

07:13.851 --> 07:15.680
gone out for a drink at some point.

07:15.681 --> 07:19.140
I like to keep my private
life private, ma'am.

07:19.141 --> 07:20.720
You've done a superb job.

07:20.721 --> 07:22.390
Um, I'm glad you're coming.

07:22.391 --> 07:24.470
That'll be great, and I look forward

07:24.471 --> 07:26.473
- to maybe meeting your son.
- Oh, thank you.

07:26.474 --> 07:30.140
Be honored to introduce you
to him if I can coax him out.

07:30.141 --> 07:34.470
He's an artist, so he's
anti everything we stand for.

07:34.471 --> 07:35.680
Oh.

07:35.681 --> 07:38.260
I've got a budding one of those myself.

07:39.391 --> 07:41.071
See you tomorrow, Madam Secretary.

07:43.431 --> 07:46.760
Okay.

07:46.761 --> 07:50.090
I am off to the treaty signing in Myanmar.

07:50.091 --> 07:50.821
Okay. Cool.

07:50.822 --> 07:51.550
Sounds good.

07:51.551 --> 07:53.010
What's the time difference there?

07:53.011 --> 07:55.760
11 and a half hours.

07:55.761 --> 07:57.640
Wow.

07:57.641 --> 08:00.090
Guess everybody's over the gig, huh?

08:00.091 --> 08:02.590
Kind of got it down by now, Mom.

08:02.591 --> 08:05.300
Obviously. Jason isn't even here.

08:05.301 --> 08:06.800
He's getting donuts with the Dudes.

08:06.801 --> 08:08.090
It's their jam.

08:08.091 --> 08:09.970
If we were upset, then you would feel torn

08:09.971 --> 08:11.930
between your family and your career,

08:11.931 --> 08:13.590
and is that what you really want?

08:14.851 --> 08:16.550
Is there something in the middle?

08:16.551 --> 08:19.470
Just go and have another
wonderful history-making trip

08:19.471 --> 08:20.970
and come home soon.

08:20.971 --> 08:22.010
Oh, security.

08:22.011 --> 08:23.390
Hey, Kevin. What's up?

08:23.391 --> 08:24.201
Bye.

08:24.202 --> 08:25.010
Bye.

08:25.011 --> 08:26.680
Yeah, okay. Yeah, be right there.

08:26.681 --> 08:29.640
Our neighbor Ted is outside.

08:29.641 --> 08:30.800
He wants to see us.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.220
It's a little late for the welcome basket.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.799
Never too late for a welcome.

08:34.801 --> 08:35.970
Come on.

08:35.971 --> 08:37.590
You're so much nicer than I am.

08:37.591 --> 08:39.590
Yes, I am.

08:39.591 --> 08:41.429
Hello, Ted.

08:41.431 --> 08:42.590
Come on in.

08:42.591 --> 08:44.680
Sorry about the whole
security thing. Thanks, guys.

08:44.681 --> 08:46.180
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

08:46.181 --> 08:47.680
I'm here on neighborhood business.

08:47.681 --> 08:48.821
Oh. Okay.

08:49.591 --> 08:50.850
Your residence has violated

08:50.851 --> 08:53.470
a number of our homeowners'
association bylaws,

08:53.471 --> 08:56.680
such as your security taking
up much of our street parking

08:56.681 --> 08:57.720
24 hours a day,

08:57.721 --> 09:00.930
the removal of trash
cans without permission,

09:00.931 --> 09:02.680
and the unsightly cones that
are placed in the street,

09:02.681 --> 09:03.930
to name a few.

09:03.931 --> 09:06.390
It's all in the complaint, but the worst is

09:06.391 --> 09:07.800
Madam Secretary's SUV,

09:07.801 --> 09:09.720
which is left running 24 hours a day,

09:09.721 --> 09:11.180
adding unwanted air and noise pollution.

09:11.181 --> 09:13.930
Well, that's a hell of an icebreaker, Ted.

09:13.931 --> 09:16.090
Why don't you come in?
I'm sure it's our fault

09:16.091 --> 09:17.510
for not getting to know you guys.

09:17.511 --> 09:18.970
We kind of hit the ground running.

09:18.971 --> 09:20.680
We keep talking about
having a dinner party.

09:20.681 --> 09:22.590
We do. We talk about that.

09:22.591 --> 09:23.640
I have to get to work.

09:23.641 --> 09:25.970
We're having a meeting on Saturday to vote

09:25.971 --> 09:28.350
on whether or not we need
to explore our legal options

09:28.351 --> 09:29.510
with regard to these complaints.

09:29.511 --> 09:30.640
You're welcome to attend.

09:30.641 --> 09:32.640
You want us to move?

09:32.641 --> 09:33.595
Seriously?

09:33.596 --> 09:34.943
I'm sure they're not saying that.

09:34.944 --> 09:36.800
Henry, they're saying that.

09:36.801 --> 09:38.050
Right here.

09:38.051 --> 09:39.760
It's-it's one of the options we've listed.

09:39.761 --> 09:42.970
Well, I am sure that you'll
find that the Fair Housing Act

09:42.971 --> 09:44.510
won't support those options.

09:44.511 --> 09:46.350
I'll tell you what, Ted.

09:46.351 --> 09:48.430
Why don't we host the meeting here

09:48.431 --> 09:49.680
at our house on Saturday?

09:49.681 --> 09:51.479
We can have brunch and
get to know everybody,

09:51.480 --> 09:52.276
work everything out.

09:52.277 --> 09:53.970
We're not looking for a party, Mr. McCord.

09:53.971 --> 09:54.970
Doctor.

09:54.971 --> 09:56.140
Dr. McCord.

09:56.141 --> 09:57.930
What party? It's eggs and mimosas

09:57.931 --> 09:59.350
and solving some problems.

09:59.351 --> 10:01.090
All right.

10:01.091 --> 10:02.970
I'll send out an e-mail to the members.

10:02.971 --> 10:04.491
Great.

10:06.891 --> 10:09.220
How could they not like us?

10:09.221 --> 10:10.510
People like us.

10:10.511 --> 10:12.220
Do you remember our old neighborhood?

10:12.221 --> 10:14.390
They called us the Merry McCords.

10:14.391 --> 10:15.121
Oh...

10:15.122 --> 10:15.850
Okay, I hated it.

10:15.851 --> 10:17.050
But now I miss it.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.861
I mean, we're likeable!

10:25.471 --> 10:28.300
So you'll have about an hour with

10:28.301 --> 10:30.180
Ambassador Maxwell before the reception.

10:30.181 --> 10:32.590
And just a reminder about protocol here.

10:32.591 --> 10:35.590
Men and women do not
kiss cheeks in greeting.

10:35.591 --> 10:38.010
No touching of the heads or feet.

10:38.011 --> 10:41.781
And in the presence of
the elderly, don't spit.

10:43.681 --> 10:45.300
I can't make any promises.

10:45.301 --> 10:46.281
I just can't. I...

10:49.931 --> 10:51.850
What's going on?

10:51.851 --> 10:53.050
Some kind of demonstration, ma'am.

10:53.051 --> 10:55.800
I'll call Ambassador Maxwell and find out.

10:55.801 --> 10:57.390
Wait.

10:59.181 --> 11:01.930
Maybe we can just wave him over.

11:01.931 --> 11:03.010
Oh, dear God.

11:04.721 --> 11:07.050
Didn't he have hair the other day?

11:07.051 --> 11:09.970
Maybe we can keep this from
the Myanmar authorities.

11:13.141 --> 11:14.901
Or not.

11:38.319 --> 11:40.268
The Arlen Maxwell I talked to the other day

11:40.269 --> 11:41.841
didn't look like that.

11:41.842 --> 11:43.182
What happened?

11:43.183 --> 11:44.842
He periodically wears the robes.

11:44.843 --> 11:46.392
The shaved head is new.

11:47.059 --> 11:47.722
Oh.

11:47.723 --> 11:49.823
He had his teacher do it this morning.

11:50.723 --> 11:52.052
His teacher?

11:52.053 --> 11:53.682
Yes. Ashin Tun.

11:53.683 --> 11:55.142
He's a Buddhist monk.

11:55.143 --> 11:57.802
Ambassador Maxwell converted
to Theravada Buddhism

11:57.803 --> 11:59.972
about six months ago?

11:59.973 --> 12:01.842
Well, his religion is his own business,

12:01.843 --> 12:04.102
but inciting a demonstration

12:04.103 --> 12:06.472
against his own country's policies is...

12:06.473 --> 12:08.602
I want to say insane, I do.

12:08.603 --> 12:09.519
You have to understand,

12:09.520 --> 12:11.939
Ambassador Maxwell didn't
come here with the idea

12:11.940 --> 12:14.069
to live a cushy life in the embassy.

12:14.070 --> 12:18.149
He wanted to immerse himself
in local life and-and culture.

12:18.150 --> 12:19.479
He's a man of the people.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.148
He's an ambassador for the American people.

12:22.149 --> 12:23.688
Well, I think he's come to think

12:23.689 --> 12:25.478
of the Myanmar people as his people.

12:25.479 --> 12:26.688
Well, I think

12:26.689 --> 12:28.068
he should rethink that.

12:28.069 --> 12:29.339
He's meditating.

12:29.340 --> 12:30.608
Is he?

12:30.609 --> 12:32.528
Mr. Ambassador?

12:32.529 --> 12:34.320
Elizabeth McCord.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.530
Secretary of State.

12:35.531 --> 12:37.761
I'm so sorry to intrude on your downtime.

12:42.031 --> 12:44.530
Arlen, do you think I
haven't taken a yoga class?

12:44.531 --> 12:46.551
I know you can hear me.

12:49.737 --> 12:52.420
Madam Secretary, I'm happy to meet you.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.391
What were you thinking?

12:55.392 --> 12:57.261
Inciting a demonstration

12:57.262 --> 13:00.761
against the very work you
were appointed to support?

13:00.762 --> 13:02.891
I tried to share my concerns with you.

13:02.892 --> 13:05.091
And when I didn't embrace them,

13:05.092 --> 13:07.471
your next step was to
humiliate the president?

13:07.472 --> 13:11.391
The right response to
injustice is civil disobedience.

13:11.392 --> 13:14.431
I came fully prepared

13:14.432 --> 13:16.971
to have a reasonable discussion with you,

13:16.972 --> 13:19.965
but since your new beliefs
don't seem to include

13:19.966 --> 13:22.261
reasonable discussion, I am telling you

13:22.262 --> 13:24.721
that you are officially
removed from your post.

13:24.722 --> 13:26.721
So when you get released from here,

13:26.722 --> 13:29.431
you can pack your bags and
head off to the monastery.

13:29.432 --> 13:30.511
Good day.

13:30.512 --> 13:31.597
All is as it should be.

13:31.598 --> 13:32.681
Yeah, well,

13:32.682 --> 13:34.265
we'll see about that.

13:35.851 --> 13:40.560
Yes, Mr. President, I am as surprised as...

13:40.561 --> 13:42.390
Well, I-I spoke with an aide

13:42.391 --> 13:44.143
from President Shwe's office...

13:44.144 --> 13:46.180
...and there has been
no change in schedule.

13:46.181 --> 13:48.390
As soon as the agreement
is signed, I'll call.

13:50.141 --> 13:54.390
Sir, it is a good deal.

13:54.391 --> 13:58.560
In all fairness, sir, I-I
don't think anyone could have

13:58.561 --> 14:01.010
anticipated a U.S. ambassador
leading a demonstration

14:01.011 --> 14:02.430
against his own country.

14:03.182 --> 14:03.930
With that said,

14:03.931 --> 14:06.201
I'm gonna do everything I can to...

14:06.862 --> 14:09.375
Sir? Sir?

14:11.011 --> 14:12.720
The president hung up on me.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.220
I'm sure he doesn't blame you.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.800
No, no, he does.

14:15.801 --> 14:17.680
I need to get back to the embassy

14:17.681 --> 14:19.680
and check in with the foreign ministers,

14:19.681 --> 14:22.060
make sure that the agreement still stands.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.600
We have... three hours until the signing.

14:24.601 --> 14:26.100
Matt and Daisy are working on

14:26.101 --> 14:27.970
a boilerplate press release.

14:27.971 --> 14:29.390
Something about the ambassador

14:29.391 --> 14:31.320
wanting to spend more time with his family.

14:31.321 --> 14:31.933
Good.

14:31.934 --> 14:34.390
And for once, we can be
thankful for a government

14:34.391 --> 14:35.680
that controls the media.

14:35.681 --> 14:40.060
There won't be any press
about the demonstration.

14:40.061 --> 14:42.100
Have you read this thing?

14:42.101 --> 14:44.890
Enough to get the gist of it.

14:44.891 --> 14:45.766
Why?

14:45.767 --> 14:46.640
I was up all night.

14:46.641 --> 14:48.140
Wait.

14:48.141 --> 14:49.140
You read the whole thing?

14:49.141 --> 14:50.800
It's like a horror film.

14:50.801 --> 14:52.180
Bioterror weaponry,

14:52.181 --> 14:54.680
diseases that jump from animals to humans,

14:54.681 --> 14:56.260
accelerated climate change,

14:56.261 --> 14:58.804
demon robots who will take over the world.

14:58.805 --> 15:01.224
Well, a demon robot is
welcome to take over my world

15:01.225 --> 15:03.804
as long as he cleans my
bathroom and organizes my stuff.

15:03.805 --> 15:05.094
You know, I'm gonna get a 3-D printer,

15:05.095 --> 15:06.304
use it to make another 3-D printer,

15:06.305 --> 15:07.514
then return the first one.

15:07.515 --> 15:08.927
- I'm no fool.
- And forget about bombs.

15:08.928 --> 15:10.844
Okay? 'Cause hacking is
gonna be the new bomb.

15:10.845 --> 15:12.634
Because banks won't be
able to keep up with all

15:12.635 --> 15:13.764
the new hacking techniques.

15:13.765 --> 15:15.134
Which means we'll have to
pay in cash for everything.

15:15.135 --> 15:17.892
Which means piles and
piles of cash in every home.

15:17.893 --> 15:19.195
Which means guns in every home.

15:19.196 --> 15:20.707
Which means shootouts in
the middle of the street.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.175
It's gonna be like the Wild West out there!

15:22.176 --> 15:23.946
Dude.

15:24.832 --> 15:27.626
These doom and gloom
predictions happen all the time.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.624
You can't lose any sleep over it.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.754
I suggest you take a
second look at that thing.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.794
Look, I'll just go with head in the sand.

15:32.795 --> 15:34.334
Okay.

15:34.335 --> 15:35.704
All right, just...

15:35.705 --> 15:37.704
just hope that sand isn't in Miami.

15:37.705 --> 15:39.805
Because it'll all be underwater.

15:52.781 --> 15:54.150
Oh, hello.

15:54.151 --> 15:57.490
Um, I'm not sure if I
have the right address.

15:57.491 --> 15:58.682
Uh...

15:58.683 --> 16:00.330
You are Roman's mother?

16:00.751 --> 16:02.750
I'm Shindy.

16:02.751 --> 16:05.090
I'm Nadine.

16:05.091 --> 16:06.630
Is my son here?

16:06.631 --> 16:09.510
I am sorry.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.630
He had band practice.

16:11.631 --> 16:13.340
Are you his girlfriend?

16:13.341 --> 16:14.800
I am.

16:14.801 --> 16:17.130
We've been together for six months.

16:17.131 --> 16:19.210
Oh, I see.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.840
And you're from here?

16:20.841 --> 16:23.210
Oh, of course, you're from here.

16:23.211 --> 16:24.590
Unless you're not from here.

16:24.591 --> 16:26.171
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.

16:26.172 --> 16:27.551
I don't mean to assume.

16:27.552 --> 16:29.251
It's all right.

16:29.252 --> 16:30.841
I was born and raised here.

16:30.842 --> 16:32.591
Ah.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.591
How is he?

16:34.592 --> 16:36.591
Uh, he's fine.

16:36.592 --> 16:39.001
I'll tell him you stopped by.

16:39.002 --> 16:41.001
Thank you.

16:41.002 --> 16:42.921
Oh, um...

16:42.922 --> 16:44.921
would you please give him this?

16:44.922 --> 16:48.291
It's all the information
of where I'm staying.

16:48.292 --> 16:51.341
My hotel, all the numbers
where he can reach me.

16:51.342 --> 16:54.051
I have to leave tomorrow.

16:54.052 --> 16:55.671
I would love to see him.

16:55.672 --> 16:56.921
I'll tell him.

16:56.922 --> 16:59.341
Thank you.

16:59.342 --> 17:01.291
It's lovely to have met you.

17:01.292 --> 17:04.421
You, too.

17:10.502 --> 17:13.192
She seems nice.

17:18.752 --> 17:21.215
Mr. President, thank you for seeing me.

17:21.217 --> 17:23.006
It was good of you to
come to say good-bye.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.836
Of course, of course.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.796
My being here has been an honor.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.437
It's changed my life.

17:31.957 --> 17:33.756
I have to tell you, Mr. President,

17:33.757 --> 17:36.376
you cannot sign that trade agreement.

17:36.377 --> 17:38.006
Mr. Maxwell, may I point out to you

17:38.007 --> 17:40.166
that 12 countries have sent heads of state

17:40.167 --> 17:42.166
to sign this agreement in two hours.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.626
That may be in their best interest.

17:44.627 --> 17:46.756
But I can tell you this agreement

17:46.757 --> 17:49.546
is not in Myanmar's best interest.

17:49.547 --> 17:51.916
Even Secretary McCord

17:51.917 --> 17:53.666
expressed her doubts about it.

17:53.667 --> 17:56.256
Really? With me, she was quite steadfast.

17:56.257 --> 17:58.416
This is a predominantly Buddhist country.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.716
The Noble Truths should be your guide

18:00.717 --> 18:02.376
as you plan for the future.

18:02.377 --> 18:05.221
Let me remind you that
one of those truths is

18:05.222 --> 18:07.566
"Don't struggle to get what you want,

18:07.567 --> 18:10.146
but modify your wanting."

18:10.147 --> 18:12.972
I wish you a safe trip
home to your country.

18:12.973 --> 18:15.146
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

18:15.147 --> 18:17.646
Uh, I, I have to keep struggling.

18:17.647 --> 18:20.776
My work here is not done.

18:20.777 --> 18:23.442
Everybody out or the president dies!

18:23.443 --> 18:25.261
Get out! Get out!

18:25.262 --> 18:26.822
Out! Get out!

18:42.222 --> 18:43.841
Madam Secretary, how was your...?

18:43.842 --> 18:45.551
What's going on?

18:45.552 --> 18:47.301
The president has been taken hostage.

18:47.302 --> 18:48.971
What? By whom?

18:48.972 --> 18:50.381
By the American ambassador.

18:59.461 --> 19:02.515
The ambassador has a gun
to President Shwe's head.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.885
And this action seems to be
linked to the trade agreement.

19:05.886 --> 19:08.015
Are we sure the gun is real?

19:08.016 --> 19:10.215
Where's a Buddhist even get a firearm?

19:10.216 --> 19:11.925
Probably brought it with him

19:11.926 --> 19:14.493
from when he was an
average American citizen.

19:14.494 --> 19:15.406
Can we talk to him?

19:15.407 --> 19:16.656
He is demanding that we cancel

19:16.657 --> 19:18.036
the signing of the trade agreement.

19:18.037 --> 19:19.576
No discussion.

19:19.577 --> 19:20.826
And he won't pick up the phone.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.326
Any idea how to get through

19:22.327 --> 19:24.236
to a gun-wielding Buddhist?

19:24.237 --> 19:25.446
No.

19:25.447 --> 19:27.236
But I know someone who might.

19:27.237 --> 19:29.406
Ambassador Maxwell's excuse

19:29.407 --> 19:31.326
to meet with President Shwe

19:31.327 --> 19:32.369
was that he wanted to pay

19:32.370 --> 19:34.036
his respects and say good-bye.

19:34.037 --> 19:35.156
But at some point he pulled a gun...

19:35.157 --> 19:36.196
Babe, are you okay?

19:36.197 --> 19:39.092
Yes, I'm far enough away from the action.

19:39.093 --> 19:39.866
Unbelievable.

19:39.867 --> 19:41.446
I guess hostage taking

19:41.447 --> 19:42.986
is the new form of negotiation.

19:42.987 --> 19:44.486
It is definitely becoming a trend.

19:44.487 --> 19:47.104
Henry, I need you to tell me everything

19:47.105 --> 19:49.853
I need to know about Buddhism
in the next five minutes.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.155
Look, I don't know what this guy's doing,

19:51.156 --> 19:52.775
but he is not practicing Buddhism.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.775
Yeah, well, he thinks he is.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.355
So just tell me.

19:56.356 --> 19:58.445
Okay.

19:58.446 --> 20:02.355
There are six realms divided
into 31 planes of existence...

20:02.356 --> 20:03.565
Henry.

20:03.566 --> 20:05.655
The point is, it's not a
five-minute conversation.

20:05.656 --> 20:06.655
Well...

20:06.656 --> 20:08.395
I need something.

20:08.396 --> 20:09.525
Some way to reach him.

20:09.526 --> 20:11.355
Maybe, what about a Buddhist quote?

20:11.356 --> 20:13.655
Or-or-or-or a Buddhist teaching?

20:13.656 --> 20:15.815
Just something to talk him down.

20:15.816 --> 20:17.985
You just want me to reach into
my grab bag of religious quotes?

20:17.986 --> 20:19.695
Why not? You do it all the time!

20:19.696 --> 20:21.525
It's adorable.

20:21.526 --> 20:23.945
I quote when it makes sense in context.

20:23.946 --> 20:25.445
Henry, please.

20:25.446 --> 20:27.815
I can't just watch him kill somebody.

20:27.816 --> 20:29.735
Or be killed himself.

20:29.736 --> 20:31.195
He's not gonna listen to you anyway.

20:31.196 --> 20:34.485
You're not his teacher or
his mentor or a monk, so...

20:34.486 --> 20:36.395
He-he mentioned that he had a teacher.

20:36.396 --> 20:38.315
Well, your best bet is to find him.

20:38.316 --> 20:41.815
Theravada Buddhism emphasizes
heeding the advice of the wise.

20:41.816 --> 20:43.655
Okay, I'm gonna...

20:43.656 --> 20:45.065
I'm gonna get on that.

20:45.066 --> 20:46.485
Listen, uh, I hate to bring this up,

20:46.486 --> 20:47.605
but, um...

20:47.606 --> 20:48.775
safe bet,

20:48.776 --> 20:50.105
you're not gonna make it home

20:50.106 --> 20:51.296
by tomorrow morning.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.485
Oh, crap.

20:54.486 --> 20:55.565
The brunch.

20:55.566 --> 20:56.985
Don't worry about it. We'll cancel.

20:56.986 --> 20:58.315
Oh, no, no, no.

20:58.316 --> 20:59.445
We cannot cancel.

20:59.446 --> 21:00.655
That would look like I'm...

21:00.656 --> 21:02.195
The secretary of state?

21:03.446 --> 21:05.395
Listen, the last thing
that I need right now

21:05.396 --> 21:08.105
is a conflict on my own street.

21:08.106 --> 21:09.485
Okay, like I said,

21:09.486 --> 21:11.339
it's just eggs and mimosas.

21:11.340 --> 21:12.238
It's easy.

21:12.239 --> 21:13.613
Okay, and you know what?

21:13.614 --> 21:15.744
I'm gonna send Blake just for good measure.

21:15.745 --> 21:16.784
Okay, well, don't worry about it.

21:16.785 --> 21:18.154
We'll handle it.

21:18.155 --> 21:20.284
And, um, I'd never thought I'd say this,

21:20.285 --> 21:22.454
but, uh....

21:22.455 --> 21:25.904
don't get too close to
the Buddhist terrorist.

21:25.905 --> 21:28.364
Don't worry, I won't.

21:28.365 --> 21:31.324
I love you.

21:31.325 --> 21:34.404
Nadine, I need you to track
down Arlen Maxwell's teacher.

21:34.405 --> 21:37.034
I think his aide said
he was a Buddhist monk...

21:37.035 --> 21:38.364
Ashin Tun... I made a note of it.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.784
Good.

21:39.785 --> 21:41.324
And I-I don't care what you have to do

21:41.325 --> 21:42.798
to get him here, just get him here.

21:42.799 --> 21:44.025
Yes, ma'am.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.728
It's 12 hours and counting
since this volatile situation

21:47.729 --> 21:50.479
began in Naypyidaw, Myanmar...

21:50.480 --> 21:52.397
formerly known as Burma...

21:52.398 --> 21:55.002
where American Ambassador Arlen Maxwell

21:55.003 --> 21:58.962
has taken the president
of this country hostage.

21:58.963 --> 22:00.962
The United States government has condemned

22:00.963 --> 22:03.212
Ambassador Maxwell's actions,

22:03.213 --> 22:05.832
which occurred after he was
released from his post...

22:05.833 --> 22:07.422
Dr. McCord, any change?

22:07.423 --> 22:08.278
Not yet.

22:09.133 --> 22:11.002
On the upside,

22:11.003 --> 22:13.042
my quiches are perfect.

22:13.043 --> 22:14.462
And I cleaned the kitchen. You're welcome.

22:14.463 --> 22:15.878
Well, I'm all set up, if
you want to have a look.

22:15.879 --> 22:17.024
Sure.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.962
So I have a 15-slide PowerPoint called

22:21.963 --> 22:24.248
"The Upside of Diplomatic Security."

22:24.249 --> 22:26.355
- Uh, would you like a quick preview?
- Actually,

22:26.356 --> 22:28.182
I really have to go study.

22:28.183 --> 22:29.562
So the quiches are on the counter

22:29.563 --> 22:31.523
and all you have to do is
cut them and serve them.

22:35.573 --> 22:37.532
Sergio and Alice. Three doors down.

22:37.533 --> 22:39.142
Hi. Sergio, Alice?

22:39.143 --> 22:40.812
Henry McCord. Very nice to meet you.

22:40.813 --> 22:42.022
Nice to meet you, finally.

22:42.023 --> 22:43.182
Uh, new Tesla.

22:43.183 --> 22:45.562
Hey, how do you like that Tesla of yours?

22:45.563 --> 22:46.643
- It's fast, right?
- Too fast.

22:46.644 --> 22:48.182
I'm going to get in trouble in that car.

22:48.183 --> 22:49.562
Oh, I hear you.

22:49.563 --> 22:51.022
I've been wanting to
test-drive one of those.

22:51.023 --> 22:52.262
Please, stop by.

22:52.263 --> 22:53.433
- He'll take you for a spin.
- Really?

22:53.434 --> 22:55.062
I'll take you up on
that. Please, come on in

22:55.063 --> 22:56.565
- and make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

22:56.566 --> 22:57.892
Gary and Margo. Big garden.

22:57.893 --> 22:59.602
Hi. Uh, Gary, Margo?

22:59.603 --> 23:01.432
Henry McCord. I love your garden.

23:01.433 --> 23:03.265
- Thank you.
- Beautiful. Please, come in.

23:03.266 --> 23:05.182
And of course, the Rhodes,

23:05.183 --> 23:05.788
Ted and Ginny.

23:05.789 --> 23:06.392
Hi, Ted.

23:06.393 --> 23:07.522
I'm really glad we could do this.

23:07.523 --> 23:08.762
And you must be Ginny.

23:08.763 --> 23:10.392
It's so nice to finally meet you.

23:10.393 --> 23:12.352
I'm really glad we could do this.

23:12.353 --> 23:13.762
Please, make yourself... at home.

23:15.523 --> 23:16.472
You're really good at this.

23:16.473 --> 23:18.472
Well, I welcome the distraction.

23:18.473 --> 23:19.393
From what?

23:19.394 --> 23:20.312
You don't want to know.

23:20.313 --> 23:22.062
I mean, did you know that
there are more plastic flamingos

23:22.063 --> 23:23.352
than real flamingos in this world?

23:23.353 --> 23:24.642
What?

23:24.643 --> 23:26.562
What? Don, Tina.

23:26.563 --> 23:27.932
Hi, Don. Hi, Tina.

23:27.933 --> 23:29.913
Henry McCord. Come on in.

23:38.642 --> 23:42.333
So for all the inconvenience
that a strong security detail

23:42.334 --> 23:43.826
may bring to the neighborhood,

23:43.827 --> 23:47.391
it also cuts crime rates
in the following ways.

23:47.392 --> 23:51.105
A nine percent decrease
in automobile break-ins.

23:51.106 --> 23:52.506
A 15% decrease in home break-ins...

23:53.106 --> 23:54.695
What about all the foot
traffic from the tourists?

23:54.696 --> 23:56.171
Right.

23:56.172 --> 23:57.645
- Yeah, like every day.
- Strangers, roaming our streets.

23:57.646 --> 23:59.435
Strangers who actually

23:59.436 --> 24:01.695
raise the resale value of your home

24:01.696 --> 24:04.238
by an impressive 12%.

24:04.239 --> 24:06.847
Remember, a famous area
is a desirable area.

24:06.848 --> 24:10.267
Now, here's a surprising
yet charming statistic.

24:10.268 --> 24:12.677
There's actually a four percent

24:12.678 --> 24:15.307
decrease in lost pets.

24:16.678 --> 24:18.637
This is all very interesting,

24:18.638 --> 24:20.467
but, uh, we were led to believe

24:20.468 --> 24:22.057
that the secretary herself would be here.

24:22.058 --> 24:23.057
Where is she?

24:23.058 --> 24:25.887
That-that was certainly our plan,

24:25.888 --> 24:27.557
but unfortunately my wife was held up

24:27.558 --> 24:29.507
by the hostage situation in Myanmar.

24:29.508 --> 24:31.467
What a mess. How did that happen?

24:31.468 --> 24:33.137
Is that trade agreement really a good idea?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.807
It sounds like they're gonna send

24:34.808 --> 24:36.057
a lot of jobs overseas.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.930
Let's not drift into politics.

24:37.931 --> 24:39.263
Let's not drift...

24:39.264 --> 24:40.597
He's right, let's not.

24:40.598 --> 24:42.847
We're here to talk about
how the secretary's lifestyle

24:42.848 --> 24:44.807
is interfering with our own.

24:44.808 --> 24:47.217
Alice, you were saying
that your garbage bins

24:47.218 --> 24:49.767
are constantly being
moved by the security guys.

24:49.768 --> 24:51.387
Well, yes, I assume it's them.

24:51.388 --> 24:54.097
And the tourists are actually picking

24:54.098 --> 24:55.557
Gary and Margo's prize roses.

24:55.558 --> 24:57.097
Oh, it's terrible.

24:57.098 --> 24:59.097
And they've caught them
on camera, actually.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.307
Not to mention the worst problem of all,

25:01.308 --> 25:03.467
which is the caravan of SUVs out front.

25:03.468 --> 25:05.557
It is difficult to have a dinner party.

25:05.558 --> 25:07.525
Also, my dog wakes up and barks

25:07.526 --> 25:09.677
every time the secretary
leaves or comes home,

25:09.678 --> 25:10.677
which is all hours of the day.

25:10.678 --> 25:13.097
Oh, please.

25:13.098 --> 25:16.057
Tell me again about your barking dog

25:16.058 --> 25:19.057
while violent hurricanes pound
millions and millions of homes

25:19.058 --> 25:20.467
up and down the East Coast,

25:20.468 --> 25:22.307
uprooting and displacing people,

25:22.308 --> 25:24.097
forcing them into these makeshift,

25:24.098 --> 25:25.637
disease-ridden little shantytowns

25:25.638 --> 25:28.387
right here in your own upscale
Georgetown neighborhood!

25:28.388 --> 25:29.934
Okay, thank you very much, Blake.

25:29.935 --> 25:30.578
Thank you.

25:30.579 --> 25:32.047
Um, why don't we take five?

25:32.048 --> 25:34.667
There's some pastries
and coffee in the kitchen.

25:34.668 --> 25:36.497
No, let's talk about the environment.

25:36.498 --> 25:38.865
Let's talk about your SUVs

25:38.866 --> 25:41.475
running day and night,
spewing carbon monoxide

25:41.476 --> 25:43.037
- into the air 24 hours a day.
- That is a protocol issue.

25:43.038 --> 25:44.000
They have to be kept running

25:44.001 --> 25:45.069
in the event of a state emergency.

25:45.070 --> 25:46.701
Give me a break!

25:47.001 --> 25:48.630
I'm sure your wife is too important

25:48.631 --> 25:50.090
to care about my son's asthma,

25:50.091 --> 25:51.960
but shouldn't she care
about climate change?

25:51.961 --> 25:53.593
Isn't that part of her job, too?

25:53.594 --> 25:56.290
I was hoping that this would
be a reasonable discussion

25:56.291 --> 25:57.830
where we could all get to know each other

25:57.831 --> 25:59.000
and come up with some

25:59.001 --> 26:00.732
creative ideas about how to live together.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.652
But it's turned into a platform

26:02.653 --> 26:04.822
for you to voice your
opinions about foreign policy

26:04.823 --> 26:06.977
and elevate your mundane concerns

26:06.978 --> 26:08.310
to global importance...

26:08.311 --> 26:10.067
...because my wife happens to be

26:10.068 --> 26:11.067
the secretary of state.

26:11.068 --> 26:12.624
"Mundane concerns"?

26:12.625 --> 26:13.954
Yeah, Ted.

26:13.955 --> 26:15.414
Your garbage bins?

26:15.415 --> 26:17.084
Really?

26:17.085 --> 26:18.414
Dinner parties?

26:18.415 --> 26:19.445
I'm sorry

26:19.446 --> 26:20.695
my house is a little busy

26:20.696 --> 26:22.405
because matters of national security

26:22.406 --> 26:24.470
really don't take a day off.

26:24.471 --> 26:27.139
There are dangers that
you will never know about

26:27.140 --> 26:28.589
because there are people out there

26:28.590 --> 26:30.929
working to make sure
you're never affected by it.

26:30.930 --> 26:33.009
People who are putting their lives at risk

26:33.010 --> 26:33.969
every day.

26:33.970 --> 26:36.839
So why don't we all just take a time-out

26:36.840 --> 26:40.839
and then, if you still want
to petition us to move out

26:40.840 --> 26:42.009
of the neighborhood, go with God.

26:42.010 --> 26:43.219
Good luck with that.

26:43.220 --> 26:45.012
- Okay, everybody out.
- Let's get out of here, honey.

26:45.013 --> 26:45.845
What? Out?

26:45.846 --> 26:46.679
Come on, let's go.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.720
- Let's go.
- Let's all go.

27:04.180 --> 27:05.509
Great diplomacy, guys.

27:05.510 --> 27:06.509
Really.

27:06.510 --> 27:08.009
Top-notch.

27:14.686 --> 27:15.923
The teacher Ashin Tun

27:15.924 --> 27:17.803
has been received by Mr. Maxwell.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.951
A conversation ensued
among the three of them.

27:19.952 --> 27:21.161
Now, if you care to rest,

27:21.162 --> 27:22.371
the president and the teacher

27:22.372 --> 27:23.661
appear to be meditating.

27:23.662 --> 27:25.411
The idea was that

27:25.412 --> 27:28.081
the teacher was going
to counsel Mr. Maxwell.

27:28.082 --> 27:30.501
We brought him in at your
request, Madam Secretary.

27:30.502 --> 27:31.701
What happened after that

27:31.702 --> 27:33.201
is not up to us.

27:33.202 --> 27:34.936
President Shwe and Mr. Maxwell

27:34.937 --> 27:37.411
want to talk to you. It's a secure line.

27:37.412 --> 27:40.241
This is Secretary of State McCord.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.331
I believe the hard work has
paid off, Madam Secretary.

27:43.332 --> 27:44.911
You must be exhausted.

27:44.912 --> 27:47.501
Why don't you put the gun down
and let's... let's all talk?

27:47.502 --> 27:49.621
Look, I know that I'm
probably going to prison

27:49.622 --> 27:51.291
for the rest of my life,

27:51.292 --> 27:54.581
but I am ready to face that possibility

27:54.582 --> 27:58.552
if I know that I have
created a better agreement

27:58.553 --> 28:00.885
for my new home and people.

28:00.886 --> 28:04.516
Arlen, clearly, you-you care
very much about these changes,

28:04.517 --> 28:06.306
so why don't you come out

28:06.307 --> 28:07.567
and let's discuss them?

28:07.568 --> 28:09.607
Madam Secretary, are you aware

28:09.608 --> 28:12.812
of the sutta of the Middle Way?

28:12.813 --> 28:14.899
I think that it's, um,

28:14.900 --> 28:17.730
similar to what the Greeks call

28:17.731 --> 28:19.363
the golden mean.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.959
Moderation in all things.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.839
It's the road between sensual indulgence

28:23.840 --> 28:25.879
and self-mortification.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.709
It's... it is the path we should all seek.

28:28.710 --> 28:30.959
And I have been successful

28:30.960 --> 28:32.919
in, uh, getting the
president to understand that.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.169
What does that mean?

28:34.170 --> 28:34.879
He agrees

28:34.880 --> 28:36.959
that these hydroelectric dams are...

28:36.960 --> 28:39.935
they're just... they're
a bad idea for his people.

28:39.936 --> 28:42.618
Well, if the president
is convinced, we can...

28:42.619 --> 28:45.254
absolutely take a look
at making an amendment.

28:45.255 --> 28:47.254
But we can't talk about anything

28:47.255 --> 28:49.714
while President Shwe has a gun to his head.

28:49.715 --> 28:51.924
It's not the president's
attention that I need now.

28:51.925 --> 28:52.924
It's yours.

28:52.925 --> 28:54.214
And when I show you

28:54.215 --> 28:57.485
on a map, uh, the-these-these areas

28:57.486 --> 29:00.445
that will be flooded and
these poor people who will

29:00.446 --> 29:01.051
lose ev...

29:01.656 --> 29:03.581
Arlen, what was that?

29:03.582 --> 29:04.741
Arlen?

29:07.407 --> 29:08.657
I lost him.

29:16.531 --> 29:18.037
The police chief isn't answering.

29:18.038 --> 29:19.853
Nor is Arlen's aide. I...

29:19.854 --> 29:21.954
Nothing reported on any news source.

29:25.984 --> 29:28.048
The president is unharmed.

29:28.049 --> 29:30.088
Oh, thank God. What about Maxwell?

29:30.089 --> 29:33.008
Mr. Maxwell let his guard
down as he spoke to you.

29:33.009 --> 29:34.798
The snipers were able to wound him.

29:34.799 --> 29:35.928
He is being treated.

29:35.929 --> 29:37.548
He will recover.

29:37.549 --> 29:39.536
The president wishes
to see you immediately.

29:39.537 --> 29:41.103
Of course.

29:45.457 --> 29:48.206
The important thing is
that you're all right.

29:48.207 --> 29:51.366
And we all deeply regret

29:51.367 --> 29:53.366
Mr. Maxwell's actions.

29:53.367 --> 29:56.246
But we came here for a specific reason

29:56.247 --> 29:59.616
- that carries great international...
- Madam Secretary, I must tell you

29:59.617 --> 30:01.036
that the reluctance that I voiced

30:01.037 --> 30:03.137
to Mr. Maxwell was genuine.

30:03.138 --> 30:06.149
In order for Myanmar
to sign this agreement,

30:06.150 --> 30:08.724
it must be amended to address the problem

30:08.725 --> 30:10.434
of the possible hydroelectric dams.

30:10.435 --> 30:12.054
This agreement

30:12.055 --> 30:15.514
was based on hard data from every nation.

30:15.515 --> 30:18.814
They predict that these hydroelectric dams

30:18.815 --> 30:20.684
will modernize your power grid,

30:20.685 --> 30:23.435
which will, in turn, help Myanmar

30:23.436 --> 30:25.685
to take better care of all of its citizens.

30:25.686 --> 30:29.515
You and I both know why
China was so interested

30:29.516 --> 30:32.967
in eliminating tariffs
on hydropower turbines.

30:32.968 --> 30:34.313
So that they could be the one

30:34.314 --> 30:35.853
to build the hydroelectric dams,

30:35.854 --> 30:38.393
using their technology and their labor.

30:38.394 --> 30:41.746
And perhaps claim Myanmar's
future water rights.

30:41.747 --> 30:42.773
Mr. President,

30:42.774 --> 30:47.443
there is something in this
agreement for every country.

30:47.444 --> 30:49.184
That's how we got here.

30:51.104 --> 30:53.153
I have a clearer picture now.

30:53.154 --> 30:56.193
Signing this agreement
is a short-term solution

30:56.194 --> 30:59.261
which will lead to much
greater problems down the road.

31:01.064 --> 31:02.693
I-I know that you are aware

31:02.694 --> 31:06.693
that it's too late to change the terms now,

31:06.694 --> 31:10.273
but perhaps we can use
Myanmar's labor force

31:10.274 --> 31:11.653
to build the dams.

31:11.654 --> 31:13.483
And at this point, Mr. President,

31:13.484 --> 31:15.233
there's no reason to suspect

31:15.234 --> 31:17.693
that China will lay claim

31:17.694 --> 31:19.813
to a sovereign nation's water rights.

31:19.814 --> 31:21.393
Tell that to the African nations

31:21.394 --> 31:23.693
where China is buying up all their land.

31:23.694 --> 31:26.313
Have you read The World in 2030,

31:26.314 --> 31:28.483
put out by your own State Department?

31:28.484 --> 31:31.733
Water is the future's
most precious commodity.

31:31.734 --> 31:33.103
So for the good of my people

31:33.104 --> 31:35.063
and future generations,

31:35.064 --> 31:36.483
I must withdraw my support

31:36.484 --> 31:38.563
for this agreement.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.813
If you could visit some of our villages...

31:55.654 --> 31:57.653
Oh, it's okay.

31:57.654 --> 31:58.754
Thank you.

32:03.654 --> 32:04.773
I was worried.

32:04.774 --> 32:06.163
I'm flattered.

32:07.454 --> 32:08.063
Seriously?

32:08.064 --> 32:09.273
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

32:09.274 --> 32:10.773
I...

32:10.774 --> 32:12.442
I really wasn't sure...

32:12.443 --> 32:13.733
That I care about my own mother?

32:13.734 --> 32:15.393
Why do you have to be so dramatic?

32:15.394 --> 32:18.443
Roman, you haven't returned my calls in...

32:18.444 --> 32:20.023
a few years, now.

32:20.024 --> 32:21.693
What about when you stopped speaking to me

32:21.694 --> 32:22.773
when I dropped out of Juilliard?

32:22.774 --> 32:24.853
That's ancient history!

32:24.854 --> 32:26.773
I was angry then.

32:26.774 --> 32:29.443
I was afraid I'd say something I'd regret.

32:29.444 --> 32:31.523
And when I tried to get
back in touch with you,

32:31.524 --> 32:33.066
- you wouldn't hear of it.
- You disowned me.

32:33.067 --> 32:34.694
I didn't disown you.

32:39.259 --> 32:40.988
I cut you off financially.

32:41.814 --> 32:45.367
If you were adult enough
to drop out of school,

32:45.368 --> 32:47.617
then you were adult
enough to support yourself.

32:47.618 --> 32:49.577
You were mad because
I abandoned your dream.

32:49.578 --> 32:50.707
No, no.

32:50.708 --> 32:53.117
You wanted Juilliard as much as I did.

32:53.118 --> 32:54.117
That is not true.

32:54.118 --> 32:55.247
And Dad was totally understanding

32:55.248 --> 32:56.747
when I changed my mind.

32:56.748 --> 32:57.983
Yeah, well, he wasn't paying for it.

32:57.984 --> 32:59.905
It always comes back to money.

33:00.038 --> 33:01.917
I was a single mother

33:01.918 --> 33:03.497
and a government worker.

33:03.498 --> 33:05.617
I didn't have endless resources.

33:05.618 --> 33:07.827
I saved from the time you were born

33:07.828 --> 33:10.157
to give my only child a college education,

33:10.158 --> 33:13.247
and you took that gift and threw it away.

33:13.248 --> 33:14.917
I didn't throw anything away.

33:14.918 --> 33:16.247
I'm using what I learned there.

33:16.248 --> 33:17.917
You're just so prosaic.

33:17.918 --> 33:20.238
It's like nothing counts unless
it's some kind of pedigree.

33:24.418 --> 33:26.007
Okay.

33:27.418 --> 33:28.695
Okay.

33:31.078 --> 33:32.537
You're right.

33:32.538 --> 33:35.997
I don't fully understand
it, but I'm going to trust

33:35.998 --> 33:39.497
that you know what you're doing.

33:39.498 --> 33:41.258
Anything to end this fight.

33:41.998 --> 33:44.157
I want to have a relationship with you.

33:44.158 --> 33:46.207
Well, how are we supposed to do that?

33:46.208 --> 33:49.718
We keep talking to each other.

33:52.208 --> 33:56.707
You return my calls, I
won't mention Juilliard.

33:56.708 --> 33:58.247
Can we do that?

33:58.248 --> 33:59.218
I guess.

34:03.078 --> 34:04.157
Ugh!

34:04.158 --> 34:05.968
I'm sorry, I have to go back in.

34:08.418 --> 34:10.348
I love you.

34:12.038 --> 34:14.348
I get that. I do.

34:27.965 --> 34:30.964
I apologize, Madam Secretary.

34:30.965 --> 34:33.623
It was my son.

34:33.625 --> 34:35.254
He was worried.

34:35.255 --> 34:38.373
Oh. Understandable.

34:38.375 --> 34:40.833
Is he okay?

34:40.835 --> 34:42.110
Yeah.

34:42.875 --> 34:44.873
Where are we with President Shwe?

34:44.875 --> 34:46.674
It's over.

34:46.675 --> 34:48.813
We're going home without a trade agreement.

34:49.909 --> 34:51.914
Called the president;
I'm not sure the hearing

34:51.915 --> 34:53.674
in that ear will ever recover.

34:53.675 --> 34:56.174
He's got a lot of nerve
holding you accountable.

34:56.175 --> 34:59.464
He's the one who put an
unstable person in that post.

34:59.465 --> 35:02.516
You got to see your son.
It wasn't a total waste.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.315
Yeah, we'll see.

35:05.755 --> 35:08.874
The truth is, ma'am, um...

35:08.875 --> 35:13.614
we've been estranged for a while.

35:14.125 --> 35:18.464
But I wanted to mend fences,
so I had to suck it up.

35:18.465 --> 35:22.124
I kept my eye on the bigger picture.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.004
And you know what?

35:24.005 --> 35:25.874
He met me halfway.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.214
At least in theory.

35:27.215 --> 35:29.105
That's good.

35:31.005 --> 35:33.175
You found the Middle Way.

35:33.989 --> 35:35.874
That's a Buddhist
principle I was lectured on

35:35.875 --> 35:38.139
by a guy holding a gun to someone's head.

35:38.654 --> 35:41.111
It's one thing to talk about, quite another

35:41.718 --> 35:42.925
to put into practice.

35:42.926 --> 35:44.605
Yeah, it is.

35:44.994 --> 35:48.363
I'll start making arrangements to go home.

35:48.364 --> 35:50.533
Uh, first, Nadine,

35:50.534 --> 35:53.573
see if you can get the Chinese
foreign minister on the phone.

35:53.574 --> 35:55.054
Yes, ma'am.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.131
Thank you, guys.

36:08.948 --> 36:10.607
Anybody home?

36:10.608 --> 36:12.817
Just me.

36:12.818 --> 36:14.207
Well, that'll do.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.031
Are you okay, babe?

36:16.032 --> 36:17.231
Yeah.

36:17.232 --> 36:18.324
- Ouch.
- Oh.

36:18.325 --> 36:20.071
I'm a little tired.

36:20.072 --> 36:22.031
I'm sure you are. I saw the news.

36:22.032 --> 36:24.441
You put that trade agreement back together.

36:24.442 --> 36:26.071
What happened?

36:26.072 --> 36:27.821
I had an epiphany.

36:27.822 --> 36:30.611
I found the Middle Way.

36:30.612 --> 36:32.731
Oh, my God. You're a Buddhist.

36:33.822 --> 36:36.031
More like a...

36:36.032 --> 36:37.781
suck-it-upist.

36:37.782 --> 36:39.901
Since when?

36:39.902 --> 36:43.111
Well, after President Shwe changed his mind

36:43.112 --> 36:46.611
about the agreement, I
managed to work a side deal

36:46.612 --> 36:48.571
with the Chinese to protect

36:48.572 --> 36:50.571
Myanmar's water rights.

36:50.572 --> 36:53.031
So, by prostrating myself

36:53.032 --> 36:56.921
and taking all the blame,
which I did not deserve,

36:58.368 --> 36:59.683
everybody signed

36:59.684 --> 37:00.684
and there you go.

37:00.685 --> 37:01.397
Wow.

37:01.398 --> 37:02.483
History made.

37:02.484 --> 37:04.273
That's great. Congratulations.

37:04.274 --> 37:05.443
Mm. Thank you.

37:06.984 --> 37:09.405
I couldn't pull things
off with the neighbors.

37:09.654 --> 37:12.653
Well, there's... still time.

37:12.654 --> 37:15.523
What, you want to employ the
"suck it up" strategy with them?

37:15.524 --> 37:18.193
While it's working, yes.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.403
I may have incinerated the Middle Way.

37:20.404 --> 37:24.044
Well, there's only one way to find out.

37:25.814 --> 37:27.613
What in the world are...?

37:27.614 --> 37:29.613
How do these things get so out of order?

37:29.614 --> 37:30.853
It's the alphabet, people.

37:30.854 --> 37:33.873
You're still upset about the 2030 report?

37:33.874 --> 37:36.623
Rising sea levels, displaced
people, economic upheaval?

37:36.624 --> 37:38.094
Yeah, it's staying with me.

37:39.834 --> 37:42.663
If you want to bury yourself in work,

37:42.664 --> 37:45.333
the secretary has a real assignment for us.

37:45.334 --> 37:46.873
Yes, please.

37:46.874 --> 37:49.463
We need to get to the
bottom of why the SUVs

37:49.464 --> 37:50.833
are left running outside her house.

37:50.834 --> 37:52.793
There has to be a way to stop that.

37:52.794 --> 37:53.504
I tried.

37:53.505 --> 37:54.213
Oh.

37:54.214 --> 37:57.043
After the evil brunch, I did some research.

37:57.044 --> 37:59.656
It would take mountains of paperwork,

37:59.657 --> 38:00.826
questions from Congress

38:00.827 --> 38:02.640
and at least six months of waiting.

38:02.641 --> 38:04.440
Most likely to be turned down.

38:04.441 --> 38:06.235
Huh.

38:06.401 --> 38:07.677
Well...

38:09.101 --> 38:13.951
in that case, there's
only one thing left to do.

38:15.981 --> 38:17.440
♪ Oh, lay your hands ♪

38:17.441 --> 38:19.810
♪ Oh, lay your hands on me ♪

38:19.811 --> 38:21.770
♪ Oh, lay your hands ♪

38:21.771 --> 38:23.600
♪ Ooh... ♪

38:23.601 --> 38:25.600
You know, when I was a little girl,

38:25.601 --> 38:27.533
we didn't have fire drills.

38:27.691 --> 38:29.980
We had nuclear bomb drills.

38:29.981 --> 38:31.350
Duck and cover.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.600
Duck under the desk and cover your head.

38:33.601 --> 38:36.640
As if that would've helped.

38:37.641 --> 38:40.520
We were all absolutely convinced

38:40.521 --> 38:43.270
that one day we would
all die in a nuclear war.

38:43.271 --> 38:44.270
Oh.

38:44.271 --> 38:46.780
We just lived with it.

38:46.981 --> 38:50.850
Oh, we... tried to get
the most out of our time,

38:50.851 --> 38:53.850
but we just hoped and prayed for the best.

38:53.851 --> 38:55.690
I studied the Cold War.

38:55.691 --> 38:58.050
It's a miracle it didn't happen.

38:58.351 --> 38:59.850
Oh, partly.

38:59.851 --> 39:01.900
There were other things.

39:01.901 --> 39:04.900
The SALT talks.

39:04.901 --> 39:08.080
Ongoing negotiations among world leaders.

39:08.783 --> 39:11.020
The Berlin Wall eventually came down,

39:11.021 --> 39:14.135
seemingly out of nowhere, but really...

39:14.335 --> 39:16.758
it had to do with a lot of people

39:16.981 --> 39:20.145
making good moves at the right time.

39:21.362 --> 39:25.310
And yet here we are again,
making a big mess of everything,

39:25.311 --> 39:27.940
and if we don't change our ways, then yes,

39:27.941 --> 39:30.770
it will be the stuff of nightmares.

39:30.771 --> 39:33.560
But if we turned things around once,

39:33.561 --> 39:36.980
I believe we can do it again.

39:36.981 --> 39:39.600
Sometimes...

39:39.601 --> 39:42.800
you have to have faith in people.

39:43.101 --> 39:46.021
Do not ever tell anyone I said that.

39:47.561 --> 39:49.520
Yes, ma'am.

39:53.561 --> 39:57.060
Meanwhile, that's why God
created alcohol and music.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.187
Now, get up there and sing.

40:00.155 --> 40:02.020
Uh, why?

40:04.101 --> 40:05.831
Because you can.

41:24.851 --> 41:27.730
Whew. Hi.

41:27.731 --> 41:29.940
Can I help you, Madam
Secretary, Dr. McCord?

41:29.941 --> 41:30.980
Yeah.

41:30.981 --> 41:33.850
Matt, I was wondering
if maybe you guys could

41:33.851 --> 41:36.045
shut off the motors for the night?

41:36.046 --> 41:37.835
No, ma'am. It's protocol.

41:37.836 --> 41:39.150
I'm not kidding.

41:39.151 --> 41:40.885
This is important.

41:40.886 --> 41:42.275
I'll tell you what, if you get in trouble,

41:42.276 --> 41:43.979
- you just blame it on me, okay?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

41:43.980 --> 41:45.835
I'm not authorized to do that.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.362
Hey, have you called Conrad

41:48.363 --> 41:50.362
to tell him the trade
agreement is finalized?

41:50.363 --> 41:53.152
Yeah, he was in a meeting, so
I left a message at the office.

41:53.153 --> 41:56.463
Uh, he's probably home by now.

42:01.073 --> 42:03.782
It's this whole thing
with the neighbors, Matt.

42:03.783 --> 42:06.112
They-they don't like the
cars running all the time.

42:06.113 --> 42:08.282
The poor guy's kid has asthma.

42:08.283 --> 42:10.022
Well, be that as it may, Dr. McCord,

42:10.023 --> 42:12.093
I don't work for your neighbors.

42:12.094 --> 42:13.302
That's true.

42:13.303 --> 42:15.431
Technically, I don't even
work for Secretary McCord.

42:15.432 --> 42:17.391
That's true, too, technically.

42:17.392 --> 42:18.892
Just hold on one second.

42:20.113 --> 42:23.532
Um, Matt, the president would like a word.

42:26.799 --> 42:29.216
Yes, Mr. President?

42:29.503 --> 42:30.742
Yes, sir.

42:32.034 --> 42:33.914
Yes, sir.

42:33.915 --> 42:35.691
I understand.

42:36.835 --> 42:38.674
Right-right away, sir.

42:38.675 --> 42:40.105
Good-bye.

42:45.475 --> 42:46.764
Thanks, Matt.

42:46.765 --> 42:48.644
I'll tell the other guys.

42:48.645 --> 42:50.264
Have a good night.

42:51.765 --> 42:53.865
Oh.

42:55.805 --> 42:57.304
I like the Middle Way.

42:57.305 --> 42:59.554
That was not the Middle
Way. That was winning.

42:59.555 --> 43:01.864
Well, I like that, too.
