00:01.418 --> 00:02.852
It's always bad

00:02.852 --> 00:04.520
when you have a messy breakup
with someone at work,

00:04.521 --> 00:07.290
especially when that someone
is Jody Kimball-Kinney...

00:07.291 --> 00:09.092
a man whose pride is easily wounded.

00:09.093 --> 00:12.228
Plus, he's the king
of dragging things out.

00:12.229 --> 00:15.298
The awkward moments,
the stilted conversations,

00:15.299 --> 00:18.101
that nagging feeling that I've
heard is called "guilt."

00:18.102 --> 00:20.203
Oh, come...

00:20.204 --> 00:21.804
But it's been a couple months,

00:21.805 --> 00:25.108
and even I don't drag
things out this long.

00:25.109 --> 00:26.476
I'm starting to wonder...

00:26.477 --> 00:29.245
will things ever go back to normal?

00:29.246 --> 00:31.647
This is exciting.
It's been such a long time

00:31.648 --> 00:34.017
since we've taken
Later Baby to a college.

00:35.652 --> 00:37.987
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather do this one on your own?

00:37.988 --> 00:39.822
Bowdoin College is in Maine.

00:39.823 --> 00:41.958
No Kimball-Kinney has
been that far north.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.159
What if I wander to Canada

00:43.160 --> 00:44.994
and they force free health care on me?

00:44.995 --> 00:46.496
Huh? Okay, you're going to Maine.

00:46.497 --> 00:48.264
And who knows? Maybe you'll fall in love

00:48.265 --> 00:50.099
with, like, a beautiful
lighthouse keeper's daughter,

00:50.100 --> 00:52.035
and we find out she was
a ghost the whole time.

00:53.203 --> 00:55.505
Oh, God, I'm gonna sneeze.

00:55.506 --> 00:58.007
Ugh, Morgan, those T-shirts

00:58.008 --> 01:00.343
- are worth more than your life.
- I'm so sorry, I...

01:00.344 --> 01:03.613
I picked up a little bug,
which bit me, and now

01:03.614 --> 01:05.114
- I'm a little sick.
- But you're well enough

01:05.114 --> 01:06.115
to go to Maine, right?

01:06.116 --> 01:07.617
Good. I'm totally good.

01:07.618 --> 01:10.820
It's actually... it's kind of
a high-profile illness.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.922
You might've read about it
in "TIME" magazine.

01:12.923 --> 01:14.957
Xenophobia? I have that, too!

01:14.958 --> 01:16.926
Oh, no, Morgan. Do you have Zika?

01:16.927 --> 01:19.395
Yep, Zika, boom. But it's not contagious

01:19.396 --> 01:22.298
unless you have sex,
so let's go... let's go

01:22.299 --> 01:24.467
get some young women pregnant.

01:24.468 --> 01:26.536
Looks like it's just you and me, Mindy.

01:26.537 --> 01:27.804
- Hmm.
- Oh, God.

01:29.139 --> 01:30.973
Morgan, what are you still doing here?

01:30.974 --> 01:33.109
The CDC and me told you to go home.

01:33.110 --> 01:35.244
Your sweat dissolved one of our chairs.

01:35.245 --> 01:37.013
- Okay, you got to help me up.
- Come on, man.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.147
Thank you, Tamra.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.983
Why is it always me who gets sick?

01:40.984 --> 01:44.654
'Cause you share a bed
with ten wet dogs.

01:44.655 --> 01:47.657
You're fine.

01:51.382 --> 01:54.030

01:54.198 --> 01:56.432
I'm excited you're going to Maine.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.668
Oh, remember, if you see Stephen King,

01:58.669 --> 01:59.936
you got to get me his autograph.

01:59.937 --> 02:01.437
No, I hate that guy.

02:01.438 --> 02:03.106
He's the reason I had blood dumped on me

02:03.107 --> 02:04.507
at three separate school dances.

02:04.508 --> 02:07.210
Hey, I wanted to ask you something.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.479
You remember my ex-wife,
Patricia, right?

02:09.479 --> 02:12.081
Mm-hmm, the beautiful
African-American woman

02:12.082 --> 02:13.282
that you have a child with?

02:13.283 --> 02:15.118
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah, that one.

02:15.119 --> 02:17.053
So she's moving

02:17.054 --> 02:19.088
back to New Jersey to be
closer to Lindsay,

02:19.089 --> 02:21.457
and I was wondering
if she could stay at my house

02:21.458 --> 02:23.226
for a few days only
until she gets her own place,

02:23.227 --> 02:25.995
but I just wanted to make sure
that was okay with you.

02:25.996 --> 02:28.631
Oh, yeah, no, I love that kind of thing.

02:28.632 --> 02:30.433
- That sounds great.
- Great, don't worry.

02:30.434 --> 02:32.735
We will have separate bedrooms,
we won't even hang out,

02:32.736 --> 02:35.071
and I'm gonna wear that Marvel
cologne that women hate...

02:35.072 --> 02:37.073
Stan Lee's Invincible.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.142
Okay. Just text me every 10 minutes.

02:39.143 --> 02:40.576
No, wait, that's crazy.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.245
We'll just stay on the phone
the whole time.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.980
Hey, you got to trust me, Mindy.

02:43.981 --> 02:45.281
I do trust you.

02:45.282 --> 02:47.150
I mean, if you can trust me with
your email password,

02:47.151 --> 02:48.584
then I can trust you with this.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.653
What?

02:50.654 --> 02:52.021
Nothing.

02:52.022 --> 02:53.656
Hello. If you could all look up

02:53.657 --> 02:55.691
from the work you're not doing,
I have an announcement.

02:55.692 --> 02:57.660
Everyone, this is my husband, Tim.

02:57.661 --> 02:59.729
He was in the neighborhood
getting out of jury duty.

02:59.730 --> 03:03.032
You know what I went with? Racist.

03:03.033 --> 03:05.067
Wait, you're Doctor Z's husband?

03:05.068 --> 03:07.637
I know, can you believe it?
I don't know how I managed

03:07.638 --> 03:10.206
to convince a woman like this
to marry me.

03:10.207 --> 03:12.375
Oh, yeah, I'm kidding.
I do know how I did it.

03:12.376 --> 03:14.143
I'm totally rich.

03:14.144 --> 03:15.444
Oh, Tim, that reminds me.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.047
Don't forget dinner tonight
with the McDucks.

03:18.048 --> 03:24.287
Yes, uh, just a second.
No, honey, I-I can't make that.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.722
A-a work thing just came up.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.925
Oh, okay.

03:28.926 --> 03:31.360
Well, at least this means
I can make my board meeting

03:31.361 --> 03:33.129
for the Audubon Society.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.964
We're choosing
our birds for the calendar.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.465
It's going to be a total shitshow.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.302
Ah, well, I'm off to catch the subway.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.338
Just kidding. Can you imagine?

03:43.473 --> 03:45.141
All right, I love you.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.143
Thank you.

03:50.914 --> 03:54.617
Okay, I saw something
hella shady last night,

03:54.618 --> 03:56.886
but I promised myself I wouldn't
spread gossip anymore.

03:56.887 --> 03:59.155
But I never said I wouldn't sing it.

03:59.156 --> 04:02.258
♪ I was up in the club,
poppin' bottles like, whoa ♪

04:02.259 --> 04:05.428
♪ Saw Dr. Z's husband
grindin' up on some ho ♪

04:05.429 --> 04:08.130
Dr. Z's husband was cheating?

04:08.131 --> 04:10.266
She's too hot to be cheated on.

04:10.267 --> 04:12.035
Does he hate beauty?

04:15.772 --> 04:17.773
So we haven't really caught up lately.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.942
Any special ladies in your life?

04:19.942 --> 04:22.645
Oh, nothing I feel like discussing.

04:22.646 --> 04:25.481
This is a work trip.
Let's just stick to work topics.

04:25.482 --> 04:29.952
Okay, anyone cute at the
hospital you have your eye on?

04:29.953 --> 04:32.288
Oh, my God, did you see
Nurse Kim's new rack?

04:32.289 --> 04:33.789
They feel very natural.

04:33.790 --> 04:37.393
I don't mean like that.
I mean work, you know.

04:37.394 --> 04:40.129
Dr. Ledreau showed me
a very new, interesting

04:40.130 --> 04:42.465
laparoscopic technique yesterday.

04:42.466 --> 04:44.133
No, that's educational.

04:44.134 --> 04:45.801
I went to school for, like, 20 years,

04:45.802 --> 04:46.836
I'm done with that ish.

04:46.837 --> 04:48.104
Mindy, I'm sorry,

04:48.105 --> 04:49.839
but I really do not wish
to discuss matters of the heart.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.807
I want to just focus on my driving,

04:51.808 --> 04:54.477
try not to hit any deer or Stephen King.

04:54.478 --> 04:56.746
You just look at your phone.

04:56.747 --> 04:59.115
Fine.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.652
Anna here are the ultrasounds
for Mrs. Rosen.

05:02.653 --> 05:05.254
Ooh, are you tearing up strips
for papier-mâché?

05:05.255 --> 05:07.590
No, tearing up paper
is a coping mechanism

05:07.591 --> 05:08.791
my psychiatrist taught me.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.593
Right.

05:10.594 --> 05:13.663
So the strips are up for grabs
for papier-mâché?

05:13.664 --> 05:15.765
Jeremy, what does it mean
for a straight man with a wife

05:15.766 --> 05:17.733
to not come home
several nights in a row?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.435
Oh.

05:19.436 --> 05:22.538
Well, we needn't always
assume the worst.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.607
Father used to disappear for weeks,

05:24.608 --> 05:27.610
but he would always come back
with an ivory chessman for me,

05:27.611 --> 05:29.445
and one time a half-Vietnamese boy

05:29.446 --> 05:31.380
I was supposed to treat like a brother.

05:31.381 --> 05:33.849
That wasn't as comforting
as I hoped it would be.

05:33.850 --> 05:36.118
Look, Anna, you know I like
to see the best in people,

05:36.119 --> 05:39.855
but if this fish stinks,
it's probably rotten.

05:39.856 --> 05:41.123
Right.

05:41.124 --> 05:44.527
Well, thank you for being so direct.

05:44.528 --> 05:47.463
Whew, that was really hard.

05:47.464 --> 05:49.799
Us English people are not
good at being direct, yeah,

05:49.800 --> 05:52.568
unless you lay a finger
on our Falkland Islands.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.970
Well, please take
as much paper as you'd like.

05:54.971 --> 05:57.173
Thank you. I didn't
want to pressure you.

05:57.174 --> 05:58.240
Okay, whoa.

05:58.241 --> 06:00.109
What up? It's your boy.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.544
Zika Diary day two.

06:01.545 --> 06:03.913
If I don't make it, I...

06:03.914 --> 06:05.915
I want you to tell
Grandmother I love her.

06:05.916 --> 06:07.083
- Ugh.
- More importantly...

06:07.084 --> 06:08.584
Watch my dad sink this putt.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.353
Here we go, you watching?

06:10.354 --> 06:12.188
It's Ben and Lindsay playing mini golf.

06:12.189 --> 06:14.890
This is how it's done.

06:14.891 --> 06:16.425
Oh!

06:16.426 --> 06:19.929
- Ben, stop! You're cheating!
- Who's cheating?

06:19.930 --> 06:22.932
- You... you just cheated.
- Yeah, Dad, you're cheating.

06:26.536 --> 06:28.437
All right.

06:28.438 --> 06:29.438
Are you okay?

06:29.439 --> 06:30.940
It's nothing. I'm fine.

06:30.941 --> 06:32.274
All right.

06:32.275 --> 06:33.776
Ben promised me
that he wasn't gonna hang out

06:33.777 --> 06:35.444
with his ex-wife,
and he's spending time with her.

06:35.445 --> 06:37.613
They're playing mini golf.
It's frickin' adorable.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.615
He knows I'm not
athletic enough for that.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.283
Well, she is the child's mother.

06:41.284 --> 06:42.918
There's no reason to be suspicious.

06:42.919 --> 06:46.055
- Yeah?
- What does she look like?

06:46.056 --> 06:48.557
Oh, damn. Girl can get it.

06:48.558 --> 06:50.559
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.395
Uh, look, there's nothing
you can do about it right now.

06:52.396 --> 06:54.463
If it'll take your mind off of things,

06:54.464 --> 06:57.166
I'm willing to lift both
of my objections to you driving.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.969
Yeah, maybe I should drive.

06:59.970 --> 07:02.071
Plus, if I'm not driving,

07:02.072 --> 07:03.839
I can partake in a little refreshment.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.141
Oh, my God,

07:05.142 --> 07:06.909
If I fall asleep
and my hand goes down my pants,

07:06.910 --> 07:09.078
do not worry... it is not sexual.

07:09.079 --> 07:11.415
I'm just instinctually
protecting the family line.

07:13.283 --> 07:16.452
What's up? It's your boy.
Little Zika update.

07:16.453 --> 07:19.755
So I died for a little bit,
because I saw a bright light,

07:19.756 --> 07:22.258
and I felt this bony hand
on my shoulder,

07:22.259 --> 07:23.926
and it wasn't Grandma this time.

07:23.927 --> 07:26.127
That was really good, Morgan.

07:26.152 --> 07:27.362
Let's just keep rolling,

07:27.387 --> 07:29.331
and I'm just gonna rattle off
some will and testament stuff.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.600
I'm gonna leave all my dogs to you, Tam.

07:31.601 --> 07:32.935
You got to take care of all of them,

07:32.936 --> 07:34.270
love them like they were your own.

07:34.271 --> 07:36.305
- Hi, guys.
- What up, Colette?

07:36.306 --> 07:37.940
How was work? What happened?

07:37.941 --> 07:39.608
She didn't tell you?

07:39.609 --> 07:42.378
Tamra caught Anna's husband
cheating on her.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.113
- What?
- Ooh...

07:44.114 --> 07:46.982
Wait, were you filming that?

07:46.983 --> 07:48.451
I am, and...

07:48.452 --> 07:50.686
Oh, I think I just posted it.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.655
What?

07:52.656 --> 07:55.124
Delete it before WikiLeaks gets it.

07:55.125 --> 07:58.461
I can't. It already reposted
on HuffPost Divorce.

07:58.462 --> 08:00.029
She didn't tell you?

08:00.030 --> 08:03.065
Tamra caught Anna's husband
cheating on her.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.066
Oh, my God!

08:05.068 --> 08:06.802
- You hit Stephen King!
- No.

08:06.803 --> 08:09.071
Why does the man insist
on walking on the freeway?

08:09.072 --> 08:12.508
No, no, we didn't...
No one hit Stephen King.

08:12.509 --> 08:14.210
Oh, my God.

08:14.211 --> 08:17.079
Tamra caught Anna's husband
cheating on her.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.949
Ooh, how humiliating.

08:20.851 --> 08:24.753
Tamra caught Anna's husband
cheating on her.

08:26.223 --> 08:28.757
Ben, stop! You're cheating!

08:28.758 --> 08:31.026
- Who's cheating?
- You... you just cheated.

08:31.027 --> 08:33.562
Yeah, Dad, you're cheating.

08:33.563 --> 08:35.931
You know when you become
obsessed with an Insta video

08:35.932 --> 08:37.466
that may or may not indicate

08:37.467 --> 08:39.568
that your boyfriend still has
feelings for his ex-wife,

08:39.568 --> 08:42.770
so you abandon your plans
and you drive to his home?

08:42.772 --> 08:45.174
I do.

08:45.175 --> 08:47.776
Ah, Maine. The Pine Tree State.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.279
Musty smell of little
lived-in vacation homes.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.248
I can almost hear their insane governor.

08:52.249 --> 08:54.717
Wait, where's all the plaid shirts?

08:54.718 --> 08:56.952
That guy's wearing a tracksuit
with a gold chain.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.621
- Where are we?
- Okay, we're not in Maine.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.074
We're in New Jersey,
and we're at Ben's house.

09:00.099 --> 09:01.153
I'm really sorry, okay?

09:01.178 --> 09:04.841
I had to do it, and I hope one
day you can forget about it.

09:10.497 --> 09:12.067
Well, this is an outrage.

09:12.068 --> 09:15.137
We have derelicted our duties at
Later Baby, and you've kidnapped me.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.306
A minority woman kidnapped a white man?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.774
Okay, who would believe you
in a court of law?

09:18.775 --> 09:20.743
Hello, Bowdoin Student Affairs?

09:20.744 --> 09:22.311
Yes, I'm calling from Later Baby.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.413
I have been abducted
by a deranged Asian woman

09:24.414 --> 09:25.915
and transported across state lines,

09:25.916 --> 09:27.283
but I promise you I will be there.

09:27.284 --> 09:28.651
Come on, Mindy.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.220
No, Jody, just chill out, please.

09:31.221 --> 09:32.588
- Oh.
- Mindy.

09:32.589 --> 09:34.723
I thought you were at that college.

09:34.724 --> 09:36.759
No, I bailed on that.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.927
I thought it'd be way more fun

09:37.928 --> 09:39.461
to hang out with you and Lindsay,

09:39.462 --> 09:41.597
unless she's too tired
from playing all that mini golf.

09:41.598 --> 09:45.267
Well, Lindsay's actually at a sleepover.

09:45.268 --> 09:46.769
I see that you brought Jody.

09:46.770 --> 09:49.238
Uh, don't worry.
I'm here merely as a hostage.

09:49.239 --> 09:50.439
Okay.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.107
Well, would you like to come in?

09:52.108 --> 09:55.144
Patricia's actually cooking
dinner if you two want to join.

09:55.145 --> 09:58.280
Patricia's cooking dinner
for the two of you alone?

09:58.281 --> 10:00.449
- Uh...
- Oh, Mindy.

10:00.450 --> 10:02.117
I didn't know you were coming.

10:02.118 --> 10:04.753
I'm sorry. I only bought two pork chops.

10:04.754 --> 10:07.623
You're gonna have
to cut them into thirds, then.

10:07.624 --> 10:09.425
That sounds like a great solution.

10:09.426 --> 10:11.427
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

10:11.428 --> 10:13.629
Do you want to take my car and just go?

10:13.630 --> 10:15.364
- 'Cause you can.
- Are you kidding me?

10:15.365 --> 10:16.865
I drank the entirety of my hip flask

10:16.866 --> 10:18.300
and the entirety of my boot flask.

10:18.301 --> 10:19.969
You can't drive like that in the North.

10:19.970 --> 10:21.303
One sec.

10:21.304 --> 10:23.472
Hey, dude, your alcoholism
is not my problem tonight,

10:23.473 --> 10:24.974
and I need your help right now,

10:24.975 --> 10:26.976
so you're gonna come inside
for some goddamn dinner, okay?

10:26.977 --> 10:28.644
We're so excited to join you for dinner.

10:28.645 --> 10:29.845
- Thank you so much, Patricia.
- Great.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.615
- Excuse me.
- Please come in.

10:35.018 --> 10:38.821
Oh, Anna. Everything okay?

10:38.822 --> 10:40.322
I know it's rude to show up unannounced,

10:40.323 --> 10:41.824
but I reasoned that if I called ahead

10:41.825 --> 10:43.225
that would give you a chance to say no.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.828
As ever, your logic is impeccable.

10:45.829 --> 10:47.162
Please, please, come in.

10:47.163 --> 10:49.632
Leave your shoes on my tatami mat.

10:49.633 --> 10:51.333
Oh, I like that.

10:51.334 --> 10:53.168
I think the world should be more Asian.

10:53.169 --> 10:55.170
I often wear a surgical mask
on the subway.

10:56.473 --> 10:58.507
Well, as I'm sure you
have seen on social media,

10:58.508 --> 11:00.175
Tim has been cheating on me.

11:00.176 --> 11:02.444
Oh, well, your feathers
look a bit ruffled,

11:02.445 --> 11:05.714
but you seem remarkably calm,
considering the situation.

11:05.715 --> 11:08.050
Well, I spent the whole cab
ride screaming into my purse.

11:08.051 --> 11:11.086
Oh, careful, stress can place
a real toll on the body.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.255
Take Kate Middleton's
difficult pregnancy.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.090
Gave me a real case of the 'roids.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.226
I don't think I needed
to know that part,

11:17.227 --> 11:19.895
but I would like a place
to stay tonight,

11:19.896 --> 11:21.230
because if I go to a hotel,

11:21.231 --> 11:23.399
I will stay up all night cleaning it.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.967
You can stay here.

11:24.968 --> 11:27.936
I have a guest room for friends
and family that I've never used.

11:27.937 --> 11:28.937
Oh, good.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.972
Oh.

11:29.973 --> 11:31.507
This way, this way. Come on.

11:31.508 --> 11:34.810
Hey, Ben, I'm just gonna
help Patricia with dinner.

11:34.811 --> 11:36.979
Make sure she doesn't stiff me
on my portion.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.647
Oh, I've got dinner under control.

11:38.648 --> 11:40.949
Besides, you wouldn't know
where everything is

11:40.950 --> 11:41.984
in my kitchen.

11:41.985 --> 11:44.787
Okay, well, how is
the house hunt coming?

11:44.788 --> 11:47.956
You know, New Jersey prices
can be incredibly expensive.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.725
Maybe you should broaden your search

11:49.726 --> 11:52.995
to, like, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Alaska.

11:52.996 --> 11:54.296
You would love Alaska.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.831
I don't know.

11:55.832 --> 11:57.833
Ben doesn't seem like he's in
any hurry for me to leave.

11:57.834 --> 11:59.168
You know what, lady?

11:59.169 --> 12:01.003
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

12:01.004 --> 12:02.771
I'm not doing anything.

12:02.772 --> 12:04.606
I'm letting Ben make his own decisions.

12:04.607 --> 12:06.775
Will he choose me,
the mother of his child,

12:06.776 --> 12:09.378
or you, the mother
of someone else's child?

12:09.379 --> 12:10.946
Okay, next time you mention my son,

12:10.947 --> 12:12.648
you're gonna be drinking
your dinner through a tube.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.550
Hey, girls, I could use
some help setting the table.

12:14.551 --> 12:17.286
Coming!

12:17.287 --> 12:19.655
No, no, no, out of my way.

12:19.656 --> 12:24.393
18-year-old female, deceased,
found face down in a bog.

12:24.394 --> 12:27.129
Evidence of foul play.
Suspects... manifold.

12:27.130 --> 12:29.298
Is this the show
about the middle-aged woman

12:29.299 --> 12:31.467
who goes to a sleepy town
to try to solve a crime?

12:31.468 --> 12:33.302
Oh, that's everything on the BBC...

12:33.303 --> 12:35.471
"Broadchurch,"
"Happy Valley," "Snodpole,"

12:35.472 --> 12:37.806
"Chamberton," "Return to Chamberton."

12:37.807 --> 12:40.242
And who is that blonde woman?

12:40.243 --> 12:41.643
Well, she's the suspect.

12:41.644 --> 12:44.079
Yeah, she's been accused of
murdering her cheating husband,

12:44.080 --> 12:46.415
and now even her friends
have turned against her.

12:46.416 --> 12:50.152
We should watch something else.

12:50.153 --> 12:53.255
- How are you holding up, Anna?
- Oh, I'm all right.

12:53.256 --> 12:55.858
I should've seen the signs with Tim.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.893
We've been sleeping
in separate bedrooms for months.

12:57.894 --> 12:59.895
I thought it was
a sign of our affluence.

12:59.896 --> 13:01.430
Oh, I can relate.

13:01.431 --> 13:03.098
Father used to rent a flat in town,

13:03.099 --> 13:06.268
and I would share a bed with Mother.

13:06.269 --> 13:09.872
Well, I do appreciate
your being so kind to me here

13:09.873 --> 13:10.873
and at work.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.108
Hey, you make it easy.

13:13.109 --> 13:15.344
And in my opinion,
any guy who cheats on you

13:15.345 --> 13:18.047
is a damn fool.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.853
No, no, Anna, we can't.

13:24.854 --> 13:27.489
You... you've been drinking.
I'm your supervisor.

13:27.490 --> 13:28.524
Oh.

13:28.525 --> 13:29.958
How could I be objective

13:29.959 --> 13:31.860
about your office-supply
requests at work?

13:31.861 --> 13:34.129
Oh, God, I read this all wrong.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.998
I will find someone else to stay with,

13:35.999 --> 13:38.467
or worst case...
I'll go to 24 Hour Fitness

13:38.468 --> 13:40.636
and exercise until dawn.

13:40.637 --> 13:41.637
Anna.

13:44.307 --> 13:46.375
Jody, are you sure
I can't fix you a plate?

13:46.376 --> 13:48.577
Thank you, no. I am hungry,
but I don't want to impose

13:48.578 --> 13:49.978
on an intimate family dinner.

13:49.979 --> 13:51.980
I think it's rude.

13:51.981 --> 13:53.982
Hey, any luck getting a ride
to get out of here?

13:53.983 --> 13:55.951
Well, I am trying to find an Uber taxi,

13:55.952 --> 13:58.654
but I keep canceling because
I don't trust these weird names.

13:58.655 --> 14:00.889
They're all Eastern European and women.

14:00.890 --> 14:01.990
Okay.

14:01.991 --> 14:03.792
Patricia, this pork chop smells amazing.

14:03.793 --> 14:06.762
It smells amazing,
but does it taste amazing?

14:06.763 --> 14:09.298
I, for one, think that taste
is the most important aspect

14:09.299 --> 14:11.400
to any food.

14:11.401 --> 14:14.403
Son of a bitch. It's very good.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.271
I must say, it's refreshing
to see a woman

14:16.272 --> 14:18.941
who knows her way around the kitchen.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.442
Uh, glass of red?

14:20.443 --> 14:23.111
I bought you a bottle
of your favorite local wine.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.947
Oh, Ray Liotta Vineyards.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.015
It's so sweet that you remembered.

14:27.016 --> 14:29.251
Um, I also got you something, babe.

14:29.252 --> 14:30.953
Give me all your cash.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.054
Ugh.

14:32.055 --> 14:33.589
Hurry up.

14:33.590 --> 14:35.624
It's... it's $60 from the heart.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.726
That way, he can buy whatever he wants.

14:37.727 --> 14:39.294
That's so sweet of both of you,

14:39.295 --> 14:41.296
but there's no need to fuss over me.

14:42.532 --> 14:44.299
Patrick!

14:44.300 --> 14:46.735
As if the Irish know how to drive.

14:49.639 --> 14:53.743
Ah, if this is another ghost,
leave me alone.

14:55.078 --> 14:58.580
- What up, Dr. Z?
- You look really sick.

14:58.581 --> 15:00.315
Have you been to the hospital?

15:00.316 --> 15:03.385
Yeah, they sent me home
for being too annoying.

15:03.386 --> 15:05.554
What are you doing here?
Why are you in my neighborhood?

15:05.555 --> 15:09.591
Um, I came because I just...

15:09.592 --> 15:10.826
I could use some company.

15:10.827 --> 15:11.994
Come on in.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.428
- Thank you.
- Hold on.

15:13.429 --> 15:14.796
Oh, oh! Aah!

15:14.797 --> 15:16.565
Ugh!

15:16.566 --> 15:18.600
Hey, full disclosure...

15:18.601 --> 15:20.302
There's Zika all over your scarf.

15:20.303 --> 15:21.770
- Yeah, just...
- I'm gonna take it.

15:21.771 --> 15:23.272
Just please get it off.

15:23.273 --> 15:25.774
Oh, God, just destroy it.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.579
You know, Patricia,
if you'd feel more comfortable,

15:30.580 --> 15:32.648
I would love to put you up at a hotel.

15:32.649 --> 15:35.450
You know, I actually have those
free days from Radisson

15:35.451 --> 15:37.519
because I was injured in a bed collapse.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.588
Thank you, but, no.

15:39.589 --> 15:41.590
A hotel wouldn't have
so many happy memories.

15:41.591 --> 15:43.191
Huh.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.960
Anyone want seconds?

15:44.961 --> 15:46.795
Mindy, you want fourths?

15:46.796 --> 15:48.030
Ouch, what the hell?

15:48.031 --> 15:50.065
Do you sharpen your toenails to a point?

15:50.066 --> 15:51.366
Hey, that's rude.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.535
They're naturally sharp.
I can do nothing about that.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.004
The ladies at the nail salon
call me Mama Hawk.

15:56.005 --> 15:58.273
All right, Mindy, what is going on?

15:58.274 --> 16:00.809
You barge in here unannounced.
You're rude to Trish.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.611
You brought a guy
who bought you an apartment.

16:02.612 --> 16:04.880
Oh, don't worry,
my Uber man's on his way

16:04.881 --> 16:06.581
in his... Volvo?

16:06.582 --> 16:08.951
I wouldn't trust a Swede
to find his own elbow,

16:08.952 --> 16:10.752
much less Manhattan. "Cancel."

16:10.753 --> 16:11.920
Okay, I had to come here

16:11.921 --> 16:13.956
because she is clearly
trying to get you back.

16:13.957 --> 16:15.157
And you know what?

16:15.158 --> 16:16.892
She told me that
at your daughter's bat mitzvah.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.261
Oh, please, why would
I say something like that

16:19.262 --> 16:20.696
to a deranged stranger?

16:20.697 --> 16:23.365
Honestly, Ben, I don't feel safe
with her in our house.

16:23.366 --> 16:25.267
Well, it's not your house.
It belongs to the bank.

16:25.268 --> 16:27.369
I know that 'cause I was
snooping through your files.

16:27.370 --> 16:29.438
Mindy, Trish and I
have a daughter together.

16:29.439 --> 16:31.106
She's always gonna be a part of my life.

16:31.107 --> 16:32.607
You have to accept that.

16:32.608 --> 16:35.445
I mean, you've come to accept
my action-figure room.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.950
Okay, fine.

16:41.951 --> 16:44.286
Well, maybe I won't
always be part of your life.

16:44.287 --> 16:45.821
- I'm leaving.
- Wait...

16:45.822 --> 16:47.055
Jody, we're leaving.

16:47.056 --> 16:49.725
Oh, ride with an angry
Asian-lady driver?

16:49.726 --> 16:50.826
Oh, I'm not that drunk.

16:50.827 --> 16:53.295
No, I'm gonna wait for Turlock?

16:53.296 --> 16:54.663
God damn it.

16:55.907 --> 16:58.075
Wait, Mindy.

17:04.540 --> 17:08.276
Thanks for cleaning up, Ben.
I'll be upstairs.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.444
Okay.

17:11.681 --> 17:13.915
What? What's wrong?

17:13.915 --> 17:15.217
Look, I'm sorry. I told you...

17:15.218 --> 17:17.085
I don't have the ingredients
to make Sazerac.

17:17.086 --> 17:20.088
Well, that's all right.
You got the most important part.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.590
Ben, I try to make it a point
to leave the judging

17:22.592 --> 17:23.925
to, uh, our good Lord

17:23.925 --> 17:26.928
and the honorable Miss Judy Sheindlin,

17:26.929 --> 17:28.363
but I think you're in a bit of a pickle.

17:28.364 --> 17:29.631
Hey, is your car coming?

17:29.632 --> 17:31.433
Or do you want me
to make up the couch for you?

17:31.434 --> 17:32.567
When I was a boy,

17:32.568 --> 17:34.836
I had a beautiful Irish setter
named Manassas.

17:34.837 --> 17:36.838
- Okay.
- We did everything together.

17:36.839 --> 17:38.507
We roamed the hills, fished the creeks,

17:38.508 --> 17:40.509
even licked peanut butter
off each other's noses.

17:40.510 --> 17:42.844
Then one day I hollered at old Manassas

17:42.845 --> 17:44.980
for chewing on my ball glove,
and it was over.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.549
He took off, but soon
I got myself a new dog.

17:47.550 --> 17:48.784
Hey, do you want to check your phone?

17:48.785 --> 17:50.285
'Cause sometimes the driver texts.

17:50.286 --> 17:54.423
My new dog was a mangy, loud,
ornery old cuss named Hamhock.

17:54.424 --> 17:56.091
Now, no one would say
that Hamhock was prettier

17:56.092 --> 17:57.125
than my old dog,

17:57.126 --> 18:00.328
but Hamhock was loyal, and she was mine.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.630
So, on that day, months later,

18:01.631 --> 18:04.399
when old Manassas finally
came back from his travels,

18:04.400 --> 18:06.201
I did the only thing I could do.

18:06.202 --> 18:07.436
I shot him dead.

18:07.437 --> 18:09.604
What? Oh, my God.

18:09.605 --> 18:12.908
Ben, do you understand my story?

18:12.909 --> 18:14.709
I think so.

18:14.710 --> 18:16.645
You just drank so much whiskey.

18:16.646 --> 18:18.413
Well, look at that.

18:18.414 --> 18:19.748
Ben, face it.

18:19.749 --> 18:22.384
It's like that old saying
we have in the South...

18:22.385 --> 18:24.419
"That woman is trying

18:24.420 --> 18:26.421
to get back with you."

18:26.422 --> 18:29.324
I guess I liked that two women
were fighting over me.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.725
Hey, I get it. The only thing better

18:30.726 --> 18:32.594
is having three women fighting over you.

18:32.595 --> 18:35.597
Ask the Dixie Chicks about that.

18:35.598 --> 18:37.666
I'm gonna go talk to her. Thanks, Jody.

18:37.667 --> 18:38.667
Sure.

18:38.668 --> 18:40.602
Hey, feel free to finish up the whis...

18:40.603 --> 18:43.372
Wow, all gone. Good work.

18:45.007 --> 18:48.877
Dave in an Oldsmobile...
now, that I can work with.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.346
Just push it in.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.615
The lock's been broken for months.

18:53.616 --> 18:56.284
Uh, hello.

18:56.285 --> 18:59.187
Uh, I just wanted to
make sure you got home safe.

18:59.188 --> 19:00.555
And I thought you might be hungry,

19:00.556 --> 19:03.158
because, well,
that's usually a safe bet.

19:03.159 --> 19:04.626
You brought me McDonald's?

19:04.627 --> 19:05.861
- Yeah.
- Thank you, Jody.

19:05.862 --> 19:08.964
Oh, man, an Egg McMuffin
and French fries?

19:08.965 --> 19:10.532
I love all-day breakfast.

19:10.533 --> 19:11.967
I can't wait to eat this whole bag.

19:11.968 --> 19:15.470
Well, some of that stuff's
for me, but y-you go to town.

19:15.471 --> 19:19.241
Hey, I'm really sorry that
I bailed on our trip to Bowdoin,

19:19.242 --> 19:22.043
but I called them, and
I rescheduled our presentation,

19:22.044 --> 19:24.579
and we're gonna be doing it
during Spring Fling.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.047
I already got my fake ID.

19:26.048 --> 19:28.316
Okay, but I'm not letting you
drive this time.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.453
And I'm really sorry

19:31.454 --> 19:33.788
that I dragged you to New Jersey
against your will.

19:33.789 --> 19:36.424
I got to stop taking hostages.
And what even was the point?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.126
Because Ben and Patricia
are probably having sex

19:38.127 --> 19:39.995
on top of their divorce
paperwork as we speak.

19:39.996 --> 19:43.598
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that, Hamhock... Mindy.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.233
Listen, I don't like

19:45.234 --> 19:47.502
the way things have been between us.

19:47.503 --> 19:50.672
- Me neither.
- Can we be friends again?

19:50.673 --> 19:52.574
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:52.575 --> 19:55.277
- Friends with sexual tension?
- Okay.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.279
So what are we watching?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.814
This is "Batman v Superman."

19:59.815 --> 20:01.449
Wait, why are they dueling?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.018
Aren't they both
on the same side of justice?

20:03.019 --> 20:04.686
Yeah, it's a little confusing.

20:04.687 --> 20:07.422
I think they're trying to figure
out which one of them is hotter.

20:07.423 --> 20:10.692
Mm. Oh, that's that boy
from "Peal Harbor."

20:10.693 --> 20:12.627
- Yes, good eye.
- Thank you.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.863
Okay, some backstory...
he was with "Maid in Manhattan."

20:14.864 --> 20:16.965
And then he got married
to "13 Going on 30."

20:16.966 --> 20:19.735
That clarifies nothing for me, no.

20:23.944 --> 20:26.771
_

20:26.795 --> 20:28.670
__

20:29.326 --> 20:31.943
_

20:31.967 --> 20:37.327
__

20:38.093 --> 20:40.155
_

20:40.179 --> 20:42.395
__

20:47.163 --> 20:50.065
Anna? I didn't know you slept.

20:50.066 --> 20:53.335
Mindy, uh, I must have nodded off

20:53.336 --> 20:55.403
during my Arabic exercises.

20:55.404 --> 20:58.106
Whoa, you look bad.

20:58.107 --> 20:59.975
Excuse me?

20:59.976 --> 21:01.443
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I just...

21:01.444 --> 21:03.278
I've never seen you rumpled before.

21:03.279 --> 21:05.280
I was starting to think
you might be a robot.

21:05.281 --> 21:08.583
Oh, that's why you keep
dumping cups of water on me.

21:08.584 --> 21:09.684
It is.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.153
Hey, I heard
about what happened with Tim.

21:12.154 --> 21:13.521
I'm really sorry.

21:13.522 --> 21:17.359
Cheating is not okay,
unless you're the Patriots.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.229
It's just nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

21:21.230 --> 21:23.732
I-I don't even think I can go
back to the brownstone

21:23.733 --> 21:24.966
to get my wrist weights.

21:24.967 --> 21:27.135
I can feel myself losing arm tone.

21:27.136 --> 21:28.603
Do you have a place to stay?

21:28.604 --> 21:30.138
Uh, I don't know.

21:30.139 --> 21:33.041
Honestly, I've never lived alone before.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.844
First it was home, and then
Miss Tipton's School for Girls,

21:35.845 --> 21:37.479
and then Swarthmore,
and then Harvard Med,

21:37.480 --> 21:38.980
and then I met Tim.

21:38.981 --> 21:41.116
Damn, #AnnaSoWhite.

21:41.117 --> 21:43.818
I don't even know
how to find an apartment.

21:43.819 --> 21:45.453
Do I write a letter to the mayor?

21:45.454 --> 21:49.824
Look, Anna, why don't you
just stay with me for a while?

21:49.825 --> 21:51.326
Really?

21:51.327 --> 21:53.495
I must warn you,
most of my female roommates

21:53.496 --> 21:54.829
have tried to become me.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.331
Yeah, that might happen.

21:56.332 --> 21:57.832
Okay, here are the house rules.

21:57.833 --> 21:59.668
You have to laugh at all my jokes.

21:59.669 --> 22:01.269
You have to applaud all my outfits.

22:01.270 --> 22:03.838
You can eat vegetables,
just not in front of my son.

22:03.839 --> 22:06.174
So I just... I won't eat, then.

22:06.175 --> 22:08.176
What's up, ladies?

22:08.177 --> 22:10.278
I know, I know. I have Zika. Shh.

22:10.279 --> 22:13.515
But I missed you guys,
and I... I'm feeling a lot better.

22:13.516 --> 22:15.317
You look really sick.

22:15.318 --> 22:17.887
I feel great. I...

22:19.288 --> 22:21.122
- Aah!
- Oh!

22:21.123 --> 22:22.824
Morgan! Oh, my God!

22:22.825 --> 22:25.093
- Is he dead?
- I don't think so.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.795
- Morgan, don't you dare die.
- Ugh.

22:26.796 --> 22:28.897
I need you pick up
my dry cleaning later.

22:28.898 --> 22:30.833
Go to bed.

22:30.927 --> 22:35.927
