00:44.624 --> 00:45.591
It's time.

01:01.185 --> 01:02.886
Whoa! Take it easy!

01:02.920 --> 01:05.690
Just calm down. You're having an episode.

01:05.723 --> 01:07.892
It's totally understandable
for someone in your condition.

01:07.925 --> 01:10.024
Don't get textbook-y on me, professor.

01:10.056 --> 01:11.862
This is not a condition!

01:12.723 --> 01:14.398
- We're at war.
- Yeah.

01:14.431 --> 01:16.470
We're at war, so listen to me.

01:16.502 --> 01:20.470
Amaru's out there with her slaves
looking for the door to hell.

01:20.503 --> 01:23.096
You and I have scoured this entire ranch

01:23.130 --> 01:25.110
and we've come up with nothing.

01:25.143 --> 01:28.244
So what do you say we go pick
up their trail somewhere else.

01:28.277 --> 01:29.913
What, are you giving the orders now?

01:29.946 --> 01:31.381
No, I'm not giving the orders.

01:31.414 --> 01:34.084
It's a... a request.

01:34.118 --> 01:37.220
This is one big field
trip for you, isn't it?

01:37.253 --> 01:39.255
You-you-you wannabe.

01:39.288 --> 01:42.425
I've been to war! You just teach it.

01:42.458 --> 01:44.094
Oh, that's the last straw.

01:48.098 --> 01:50.901
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

01:58.809 --> 01:59.944
Look at this.

02:03.113 --> 02:04.915
Looks like a tunnel.

02:04.947 --> 02:08.151
Wow. Figured that out
all by your lonesome, huh.

02:11.355 --> 02:15.024
Wait a second, I got a
bad feeling about this.

02:15.058 --> 02:17.495
Stop! Come back up.
Come back up right now!

02:17.528 --> 02:19.830
Go back to your lecture hall.

02:19.862 --> 02:22.133
Those that can't do, teach!

02:36.313 --> 02:39.283
I guess you finally got schooled.

02:39.315 --> 02:40.384
Man.

02:57.066 --> 02:58.119
What the hell?

02:58.151 --> 03:00.237
- We gotta leave.
- What happened?

03:01.258 --> 03:03.326
She found me.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.329
I found him. I found Richard Gecko.

03:05.361 --> 03:07.330
What? No, no. Dakota, Richie's dead.

03:07.364 --> 03:09.066
No, that's what he wants you
to think, but I found him.

03:09.098 --> 03:11.167
- I found him and I shot him.
- OK, OK.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.603
Come on.

03:18.408 --> 03:19.709
What the hell were you thinking?

03:19.742 --> 03:21.645
I had it all worked out.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.647
I was gonna shoot him and
make it look like he mugged me.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.651
- So, what happened?
- I blasted him with my father's shotgun

03:26.683 --> 03:29.252
and he got away. Don't ask me how.

03:29.286 --> 03:32.255
I don't know who you think
you shot, but I saw the Geckos,

03:32.288 --> 03:35.225
both of them, with my own
eyes, burnt to a crisp.

03:35.259 --> 03:37.895
I told you that they
could've easily faked that.

03:37.927 --> 03:39.996
I have studied my father's files.

03:40.029 --> 03:41.966
I am a goddamn expert at them.

03:41.998 --> 03:44.701
Richard is some off-the-scale brainiac.

03:44.735 --> 03:46.249
You're a fucking idiot.

03:46.274 --> 03:49.005
How can you be worried about
getting laid at a time like this?

03:49.038 --> 03:51.675
She is a doctor. She was
gonna help me get control.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.444
Control of what?

03:53.477 --> 03:55.913
It doesn't matter! The
point is, she found my bar.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.348
She might've staked out this place, too.

03:58.382 --> 04:00.884
She's probably on her way over
here with her daddy's cop friends.

04:00.918 --> 04:04.688
Or the Ranger that daddy trained.
I guess it didn't occur to you.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.957
There anything else you wanna
fuck up before the day is over?

04:08.792 --> 04:10.394
- We got a problem.
- You're supposed to be on watch.

04:10.426 --> 04:13.063
Look outside. Out west.
You can't miss it.

04:21.805 --> 04:23.807
Oh, shit.

04:27.343 --> 04:29.279
That is biblical.

04:29.312 --> 04:32.817
I checked with all the local
hospitals, no one has seen him.

04:32.850 --> 04:34.852
Maybe he's gone to some
underground doctor.

04:35.918 --> 04:36.887
Yeah, it's possible.

04:44.977 --> 04:46.831
Oh... son of a mother...

04:51.201 --> 04:52.436
Ow!

05:00.076 --> 05:01.978
Are you even listening to me?

05:02.011 --> 05:03.346
Look, I'll handle it, Dakota.

05:03.379 --> 05:05.050
I'm not just gonna walk away from this.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.789
So why don't you call the
task force? I could help.

05:06.823 --> 05:08.953
You need to go somewhere safe.
Hide out for a few days.

05:08.985 --> 05:10.487
I am not afraid of him.

05:10.521 --> 05:12.798
- Why are you fighting me on this?
- OK.

05:12.831 --> 05:13.958
You say you shot Richie.

05:13.983 --> 05:15.960
What's to say he doesn't
come back and try to shoot you?

05:15.992 --> 05:18.762
Go to a friend's house,
some place he won't be able to find you.

05:18.795 --> 05:22.533
Ferdinand, that is not the
way my father raised me.

05:22.565 --> 05:24.100
I cannot turn my back on this.

05:24.134 --> 05:26.370
He raised me, too. Remember?

05:27.237 --> 05:28.239
Look...

05:29.406 --> 05:31.181
if anything were to happen to you,

05:31.874 --> 05:33.244
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

05:36.814 --> 05:37.782
I got this.

06:30.901 --> 06:33.069
Come on, you two. Wash up for dinner.

06:42.112 --> 06:43.114
Move it!

06:46.350 --> 06:48.386
Go, go, go, go. Inside, inside!

06:55.124 --> 06:56.160
Come on, honey!

06:56.192 --> 06:57.127
Open the door!

07:46.610 --> 07:47.645
They've landed.

07:49.245 --> 07:51.048
This is where it begins.

07:52.615 --> 07:53.985
It's perfect.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.261
Yes, peanut?

08:05.295 --> 08:07.131
I don't know where the remote is.

08:07.163 --> 08:08.598
Daddy'll be home soon.

08:08.632 --> 08:09.634
Love you.

09:05.722 --> 09:07.391
What the hell?

09:46.679 --> 09:55.742
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

10:04.547 --> 10:08.151
Best I can tell, this is
where the swarm of locusts landed.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.193
You really think she's behind all this?

10:17.227 --> 10:18.849
I don't know what else it could be.

10:19.396 --> 10:22.366
- Richard?
- Sure as hell feels like it.

10:22.399 --> 10:24.601
Scott, go check the backyards.

10:24.633 --> 10:26.636
Let's see if we can figure
out where these things went.

10:30.473 --> 10:32.309
- What?
- He's gonna wanna know about this.

10:32.342 --> 10:34.311
Oh, my God. Will you
forget the Ranger, please?

10:34.343 --> 10:36.512
We got enough going on without
you adding a layer of bullshit.

10:36.545 --> 10:38.614
There's already another layer, brother.

10:38.647 --> 10:41.819
Amaru's only ever gone
after culebras and us.

10:41.852 --> 10:43.853
These are civilians.

10:43.886 --> 10:45.088
She's changing the game.

10:53.162 --> 10:54.632
I don't think the bugs
are out there anymore.

10:54.797 --> 10:56.232
Sit down, let's eat.

10:57.501 --> 10:59.569
What makes insects act like that?

10:59.603 --> 11:02.606
Sometimes locusts work
themselves into a frenzy.

11:02.638 --> 11:04.240
Just ask the ancient Egyptians.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.779
Mom, you OK?

11:09.813 --> 11:13.584
I just have weird ache in my back.

11:13.617 --> 11:15.685
Hon, sit down for dinner.
There's plenty of lemonade.

11:26.695 --> 11:29.499
- Mom?
- Offer yourself up to me.

11:29.532 --> 11:30.901
Honey?

11:30.934 --> 11:32.569
For in your tender flesh...

11:34.237 --> 11:35.671
I will find enlightenment.

11:37.940 --> 11:39.509
Jesus! Get off!

11:41.744 --> 11:42.579
Oh, my God!

11:43.546 --> 11:44.447
No!

11:47.717 --> 11:48.853
Leave me alone!

11:56.492 --> 11:57.393
Reuben!

11:59.362 --> 12:00.497
I'm trying to help!

12:05.211 --> 12:06.312
What's happening?

12:06.337 --> 12:08.104
What's wrong with my mom?
Why's she trying to eat my dad?

12:08.137 --> 12:11.317
OK. OK, buddy, take it easy.

12:12.952 --> 12:14.688
Shooting the place up
isn't gonna do any good.

12:16.488 --> 12:20.826
So why don't you just
take a deep breath, OK?

12:20.860 --> 12:22.696
- Give me the...
- Dad!

12:22.728 --> 12:24.665
- Gotta be strong, OK?
- Sit down!

12:25.464 --> 12:27.166
Just... sit.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.235
OK? Fuck.

12:30.269 --> 12:32.839
- How is he?
- He lost a lot of blood.

12:33.772 --> 12:35.207
What about her?

12:35.241 --> 12:37.177
Big bugs and not even a mosquito bite.

12:38.477 --> 12:40.746
His soul brought me enlightenment.

12:43.415 --> 12:44.450
Think he was doing the neighbor?

12:44.483 --> 12:46.752
Hey, asshole,

12:46.785 --> 12:48.921
- don't come into my house accusing...
- Just chill. Chill out!

12:50.857 --> 12:53.959
OK, buddy. Just tell me what happened.

12:53.992 --> 12:56.362
She tried to eat him. She
tried to fucking eat my dad!

13:02.334 --> 13:03.436
You guys from the government
or something?

13:04.904 --> 13:06.338
- Like men in...
- They're not.

13:06.371 --> 13:08.241
Texas Ranger Freddie Gonzalez.

13:09.442 --> 13:10.376
They're with me.

13:43.876 --> 13:44.910
Fuck!

13:44.944 --> 13:47.447
You're witnessing history, son.

13:47.479 --> 13:49.548
What? What the hell are you doing here?

13:49.582 --> 13:51.284
Weren't you with that... that Burt guy?

13:51.317 --> 13:53.052
We lost him.

13:53.084 --> 13:55.487
- You what?
- He's gone now, kid.

13:58.223 --> 13:59.424
- Don't move.
- What?! Get 'em off me!

13:59.458 --> 14:00.927
Don't move. Don't move.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.020
- You hurt?
- No.

14:15.308 --> 14:16.309
What the hell was that?

14:19.344 --> 14:21.346
Fuckers must not be hungry.

14:21.380 --> 14:23.448
- Scorpion?
- No, this here's

14:23.482 --> 14:25.451
a supernatural vinegaroon.

14:25.483 --> 14:27.286
Except these fuckers can fly.

14:29.955 --> 14:32.124
It's a Xibalban myot.

14:35.493 --> 14:38.197
- Why is that history?
- Why is it history?

14:38.231 --> 14:41.333
Because there hasn't been an
infestation of this magnitude

14:41.367 --> 14:43.937
since the last Xibalban war.

14:43.969 --> 14:47.555
Entire villages lost their food supplies.

14:48.306 --> 14:51.910
And they had to come up
with other means to feed.

14:51.944 --> 14:53.313
By other means...

14:55.347 --> 14:58.184
Offer your flesh to me, trespassers.

14:58.217 --> 15:00.420
Oh, don't let him bite you.

15:00.453 --> 15:02.222
- Why? Is this guy one of us?
- Not quite.

15:02.255 --> 15:03.489
What the hell is he?

15:03.521 --> 15:05.224
I'm dating myself here,

15:05.257 --> 15:09.128
but he's a not so fine,
not so young cannibal...

15:11.463 --> 15:12.898
Get off of me!

15:17.102 --> 15:18.471
- Fuck.
- No! Put it away.

15:18.503 --> 15:19.972
He's still a civilian.

15:23.108 --> 15:24.576
She's a civilian.

15:24.610 --> 15:27.080
- Thanks for clearing that up.
- She is off limits!

15:27.112 --> 15:29.214
How many times do I have to
tell you? I didn't find her!

15:29.247 --> 15:30.549
- She found me!
- Hey!

15:34.286 --> 15:40.158
Setting aside the sheer stupidity
of getting any civilian involved

15:40.192 --> 15:43.062
on any level, much less her,

15:43.094 --> 15:45.597
yes, I see your point, Ranger.

15:45.631 --> 15:49.302
But you're not exactly being fair
and equitable here, either, are you?

15:49.334 --> 15:53.338
So how about, just for a
beat, we agree to disagree? OK?

15:53.371 --> 15:58.911
Seeing as how we all happen to be
standing at 3333 Cannibal-fucking-Lane!

16:00.413 --> 16:01.648
Agreed.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.248
We got bigger fish to fry.

16:06.251 --> 16:08.121
Which is why we're not doing this alone.

16:10.189 --> 16:11.391
Back up.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.263
Gentlemen, count your blessings.

16:18.296 --> 16:19.631
From what we gathered on the way in,

16:19.665 --> 16:21.400
the nearest cell tower
has been eradicated.

16:21.434 --> 16:23.368
So communication is limited.

16:23.401 --> 16:26.338
Word will get out, but we can
control it in the short term.

16:26.371 --> 16:28.373
Fantastic. So you got this. We're done.

16:28.406 --> 16:29.541
No, Mr. Gecko.

16:29.574 --> 16:32.045
We can contain it.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.981
We'll fashion a story for the public, but
it's up to you and your team to end it.

16:35.014 --> 16:36.616
Wait a second, my team?

16:36.649 --> 16:40.352
- We told you there would be challenges.
- Challenges?

16:40.386 --> 16:43.588
How the fuck can you stand
there and ice queen this shit?

16:43.621 --> 16:46.224
Your boss specifically told
us this was supposed to be

16:46.257 --> 16:49.027
a nice little war between
old enemies, right?

16:49.060 --> 16:51.163
Since when did normal, everyday
citizens become targets?

16:51.197 --> 16:53.066
You think there are rules, Mr. Gecko?

16:53.098 --> 16:56.102
If there are,
Amaru is not following them.

16:56.135 --> 16:58.404
This is our first taste of
what the world would be like

16:58.437 --> 16:59.605
when she finally takes over.

17:02.641 --> 17:03.610
Fuck me.

17:36.175 --> 17:38.311
"Just a minute," replied Momma Bear.

17:41.313 --> 17:42.681
It's OK. It's OK.

17:42.715 --> 17:44.135
Who the hell are you?

17:44.168 --> 17:46.843
- We are from the C...
- FBI.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.220
And...

17:49.321 --> 17:50.689
Joint Task Force.

17:50.723 --> 17:52.893
We're just canvassing the neighborhood.

17:52.926 --> 17:56.028
Have you or your son had any
kind of a fever of any kind?

17:56.062 --> 17:58.164
- Or any bites?
- Is this about the bugs?

17:58.197 --> 18:00.400
I brought him inside as
soon as I saw them fly over.

18:03.094 --> 18:05.596
OK... Everything looks good in here.

18:05.621 --> 18:07.390
So we're just gonna...

18:07.573 --> 18:10.676
Yeah. You have a good night.

18:10.708 --> 18:13.045
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Yeah, what's that?

18:13.079 --> 18:16.649
At least one person at every house
turned into a flesh eater but not here.

18:16.681 --> 18:19.151
Well, let's chalk it up
to the winner's column.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.087
Still got this place.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.523
That's Rodney's house. I
wouldn't worry about him.

18:23.555 --> 18:26.525
He's one of those wacko
end-of-the-world types.

18:26.558 --> 18:28.527
Well, then, he's a step ahead of us.

18:28.561 --> 18:30.696
- I say we skip him.
- Smart move.

18:30.728 --> 18:33.298
Even a step on his property,
he'll nail you with his crossbow.

18:54.352 --> 18:57.657
Our girl has a strange
fixation on those two.

18:57.689 --> 18:59.092
She hasn't resurfaced?

18:59.959 --> 19:00.560
No.

19:01.826 --> 19:04.096
I have control of her now.

19:05.029 --> 19:08.267
Now this Richie, he's dangerous.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.402
I felt it when he touched me.

19:10.436 --> 19:11.603
Give me the word.

19:12.418 --> 19:13.719
I'll destroy him.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.070
Not yet.

19:19.612 --> 19:21.217
He might prove useful.

19:21.814 --> 19:25.618
When the door opens
I'll have time to test him.

19:28.754 --> 19:29.689
You?

19:33.792 --> 19:34.727
I...

19:36.762 --> 19:38.465
didn't mean to overstep.

19:42.901 --> 19:46.805
Oh, I know you have
ambitions of your own, Brasa.

19:49.641 --> 19:51.210
I never said any such thing.

19:54.913 --> 19:55.848
I know.

19:56.881 --> 19:58.851
That's what concerns me.

19:58.883 --> 20:00.683
My only ambition...

20:01.420 --> 20:03.723
has ever been to see you rise, my queen.

20:07.825 --> 20:09.496
Well, I'll try to remember that.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.235
Is it ISIS? Are we under attack?

20:16.267 --> 20:18.537
I told you the Zika virus would spread.

20:18.571 --> 20:20.740
- My cell phone won't work.
- You think that's bad?

20:20.773 --> 20:22.608
Little fuckers ate my
entire crop of heirlooms.

20:22.641 --> 20:24.944
All right, everybody, everybody.
Calm down, please.

20:24.977 --> 20:26.946
We have several confirmed individuals

20:26.978 --> 20:29.381
who have inadvertently
consumed bath salts.

20:29.414 --> 20:32.886
How can one inadvertently
take bath salts?

20:32.911 --> 20:34.853
At this point we don't know.

20:34.887 --> 20:37.456
But anyone can be affected,
so, if you see something,

20:37.488 --> 20:38.743
don't approach anybody on your own.

20:38.777 --> 20:41.561
- Does it affect children?
- We don't know at this point.

20:41.593 --> 20:44.963
I tried calling my precinct, but
the damn bugs destroyed my antenna.

20:44.996 --> 20:46.899
Well, I called for back up as
soon as I entered the vicinity.

20:46.931 --> 20:50.736
What I need you guys to do,
just go home, stay inside,

20:50.768 --> 20:52.671
and I'll keep you informed
if something comes up.

20:52.705 --> 20:55.374
- What about my cell phone?
- You have got to be kidding me.

20:57.676 --> 20:58.711
You can't just leave.

21:00.746 --> 21:02.348
Sir. What are we supposed to do?

21:07.920 --> 21:09.354
You bastard.

21:16.862 --> 21:18.864
Excuse me, officer.

21:20.365 --> 21:22.535
Someone was bound to call 9-1-1.

21:22.567 --> 21:24.393
Their ours.

21:25.371 --> 21:28.774
It's any easy way to feed,
but today they're here to help.

21:28.806 --> 21:31.676
Culebras helping humans.
Never thought I'd see the day.

21:31.709 --> 21:33.679
You'd be surprised what we're capable of.

21:35.580 --> 21:38.183
We're fighting a bigger enemy now.

21:38.350 --> 21:42.554
Can't help but think, what if this
were Margaret and Billy's neighborhood?

21:42.587 --> 21:44.990
Your daughter is safe
because you're here with us.

21:50.429 --> 21:52.331
Something wrong, Ranger?

21:52.363 --> 21:54.266
Seen a lot of crazy shit in this world.

21:54.300 --> 21:59.839
This here, you and me having
a civil conversation like...

22:02.453 --> 22:03.621
Like I said, Ranger,

22:04.810 --> 22:05.945
you'd be surprised.

22:11.336 --> 22:13.020
Who the hell called an ambulance?

22:13.451 --> 22:15.487
- Don't worry about it...
- Hands up!

22:15.521 --> 22:17.423
Hands up! Turn around.

22:17.456 --> 22:18.858
- Dakota.
- Oh, what?

22:18.891 --> 22:20.593
- It's not what I think?
- It's not.

22:20.625 --> 22:22.795
Dr. Block, we got a lot
of sick people here...

22:22.827 --> 22:24.396
Why don't you shut your goddamn mouth.

22:24.429 --> 22:26.431
The only sicko here is you.

22:26.465 --> 22:28.734
You killed my father.

22:28.766 --> 22:30.402
Now I'm gonna get some justice.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.805
Mr. Gecko, keep your
hands where I can see them.

22:33.839 --> 22:35.641
Sir, I'm gonna ask you

22:35.673 --> 22:38.644
as a fellow law enforcement officer,
please lower your weapon.

22:39.711 --> 22:41.046
Afraid I can't do that.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.683
Dakota, you shot me point blank.

22:43.716 --> 22:45.952
Aren't you wondering how
I'm still walking around?

22:47.085 --> 22:48.820
I'm here to finish the job.

22:48.853 --> 22:51.657
This is between you and me,
not Freddie, not this guy.

22:51.689 --> 22:53.692
So I want you to keep
your eyes on me, OK?

22:53.726 --> 22:55.895
- Don't...
- I gotta do this, Ranger.

22:55.928 --> 22:58.731
- You watching?
- Dakota, whatever you do,

22:58.764 --> 22:59.698
don't freak out.

23:28.979 --> 23:30.548
Told you not to freak out.

23:33.516 --> 23:36.633
You know, my father told me there
was a darkness in this world, but...

23:37.354 --> 23:39.256
I had no idea that's what he meant.

23:40.656 --> 23:42.492
Yeah, I think he knew
more than he let on.

23:49.898 --> 23:52.401
You know, it doesn't change the fact
that you're still working with them.

23:52.434 --> 23:54.637
Don't you think it kills
me every single day?

23:54.671 --> 23:57.474
I had no choice, and neither do you.

23:57.507 --> 23:59.743
There's something bigger going on here.

23:59.776 --> 24:02.105
Bigger than me, bigger than you.

24:02.578 --> 24:03.713
Bigger than even your dad.

24:06.583 --> 24:09.253
You know, I never told you, but...

24:10.720 --> 24:13.289
what you said at his
service was really nice.

24:14.991 --> 24:17.860
If I was still talking to him
I would've said something, too.

24:20.029 --> 24:21.831
You know good and well he loved you.

24:23.333 --> 24:24.435
Yeah, it's just...

24:25.468 --> 24:26.770
so hard to look back.

24:30.539 --> 24:34.278
None of this makes any sense. None of it.

24:34.310 --> 24:37.313
These people are sick,
and we don't know why,

24:38.315 --> 24:39.450
but they need a doctor.

24:41.417 --> 24:44.287
Don't do it for me, or the Geckos.

24:45.989 --> 24:47.391
Do it for him.

24:50.460 --> 24:53.297
You're supposed to be the answer man,
professor, are you not?

24:53.329 --> 24:56.567
We observed the insects and then
they disappeared down a pool drain.

24:57.537 --> 24:58.734
And?

24:58.768 --> 25:01.438
And that's as far as I've
gotten in my investigation.

25:01.471 --> 25:02.905
Well, that's very extensive,

25:02.939 --> 25:04.808
but we can't keep
shoving people in a garage

25:04.840 --> 25:06.407
hoping this whole thing is gonna change.

25:06.441 --> 25:10.047
Obviously.
But this is science, Mr. Gecko,

25:10.079 --> 25:11.514
not one of your heists.

25:11.548 --> 25:13.083
Research takes time.

25:13.116 --> 25:15.485
Yeah, and ask him to tell
you how science killed Burt.

25:16.885 --> 25:17.587
What?

25:20.022 --> 25:21.991
- What did you do?
- I did nothing.

25:22.025 --> 25:25.062
- It was all him.
- You know what, I don't wanna hear it.

25:25.642 --> 25:29.333
The only thing I wanna hear
outta you are some fuckin' facts.

25:29.678 --> 25:31.600
Working on it.

25:31.634 --> 25:34.503
<i>And now, to the
situation unfolding in Shady Glen.</i>

25:34.537 --> 25:36.840
<i>Authorities are calling
it a bath salts scare,</i>

25:36.873 --> 25:39.676
<i>and we're moving there now to
get you the full story at 11:00.</i>

25:59.729 --> 26:02.032
Hey, it's Reuben, right?

26:08.437 --> 26:09.939
What's the deal with the lemonade?

26:11.441 --> 26:12.375
Mom makes it every night.

26:13.710 --> 26:15.979
Just lemons, sugar and water.

26:16.011 --> 26:19.482
You can have some.
Just know it's, like, diabetes sweet.

26:20.950 --> 26:22.619
Is she the only one that drank it?

26:22.652 --> 26:25.455
Yeah, she always tastes
it before she pours it,

26:25.488 --> 26:26.623
but we never got to that.

26:30.859 --> 26:33.629
Lemons, sugar... water.

26:36.665 --> 26:38.902
Thanks. Hey, Freddie.

26:38.934 --> 26:41.637
Treatment plant's here,
just on the other side of this house.

26:41.671 --> 26:45.142
Dedicated water supply. That's why
Shady Glen has been feeling it first.

26:45.174 --> 26:46.909
That doesn't mean it won't spread.

26:46.943 --> 26:48.545
My men just locked down three more houses.

26:48.577 --> 26:49.846
OK, so we spread the word, then.

26:49.878 --> 26:51.414
No water out of the tap.

26:51.448 --> 26:53.550
That explains the whole pool drain thing.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.786
We're dealing with
water-adapted Xibalban...

26:55.818 --> 26:57.988
You know what, kid?
We gotta get my books outta my bike.

26:58.020 --> 27:00.056
Dude, I'm not gonna be
your research monkey.

27:00.088 --> 27:02.058
- I'm here to slice some cannibals.
- Hey.

27:02.090 --> 27:03.959
Those people have families.
It's not a fuckin' video game.

27:03.992 --> 27:05.529
Yeah, they eat these people to survive.

27:05.561 --> 27:07.062
- Yeah, and I'm not...
- He's right.

27:07.096 --> 27:09.566
This is why this lifestyle
suits you so perfect.

27:09.598 --> 27:12.868
- So you can justify all your kills.
- Oh, like you tried to kill me?

27:12.902 --> 27:15.739
- Yes, I did! Because you're...
- Your team, Mr. Gecko.

27:15.771 --> 27:16.807
- Yes, you are!
- You're the one...

27:16.839 --> 27:18.741
Whoa, whoa!

27:18.775 --> 27:19.777
You know what...

27:23.145 --> 27:24.114
God...

27:25.815 --> 27:27.951
Next one that pipes up gets
a stake through the heart.

27:27.983 --> 27:31.687
Reptile, regular jackass,
I don't really give a shit. Got it?

27:31.721 --> 27:35.858
Fantastic.
Kid, you're with the professor.

27:35.892 --> 27:37.444
We have plenty of time
to swing your swords

27:37.469 --> 27:39.095
once we figure
out what Amaru's up to, OK?

27:39.127 --> 27:41.764
And if you two ladies can
keep your panties unbunched

27:41.798 --> 27:44.500
you're on your way to the water
treatment plant to shut it down.

27:44.533 --> 27:47.169
Everybody else, including Ximena
and her team is going house to house.

27:47.202 --> 27:50.673
So beer and juice boxes tonight, ladies.
Nothin' out of the tap.

27:50.706 --> 27:52.775
Dr. Block, I'll hold
down this fort with you.

27:54.610 --> 27:55.545
You'll be OK.

28:00.517 --> 28:03.820
If you think I'm gonna
work alongside a Gecko,

28:03.853 --> 28:06.957
then you have completely
lost touch with reality.

28:06.990 --> 28:10.193
Look around. Reality went out
the window a long time ago.

28:10.225 --> 28:13.729
OK?
Relax, I said we'd hold the fort down.

28:13.762 --> 28:15.064
That doesn't mean we have
to talk to each other.

28:44.961 --> 28:46.863
- All clear down there.
- I'll take another look.

28:46.895 --> 28:48.764
I just told you, all clear.

28:49.163 --> 28:51.067
Oh, for fuck's sake.

28:51.099 --> 28:52.735
She seduced me.

28:52.769 --> 28:56.039
She seduced me, and then she shot me.

28:56.071 --> 28:57.907
I'm not the one being
a little bitch about it.

28:57.941 --> 28:59.926
You know, sometimes
I forget what you are.

28:59.951 --> 29:00.912
You wanna know what I am?

29:00.937 --> 29:03.646
Part of a culture that you're sworn
to protect, Peacekeeper.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.984
And guess what? We can't have her
running her mouth about us to anyone.

29:09.786 --> 29:11.188
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

29:12.989 --> 29:15.125
Now, normally, I would just feed on her,

29:15.157 --> 29:16.792
but since I know you
guys grew up together

29:16.826 --> 29:18.194
I'll do the humane thing...

29:19.662 --> 29:20.731
I'll just turn her.

29:35.744 --> 29:36.712
Dakota...

29:39.816 --> 29:41.084
I told you to get away from me.

30:55.388 --> 30:57.391
You gotta let that shit go, man.

31:49.877 --> 31:50.878
Get off! Get off!

31:56.850 --> 31:57.985
You OK?

32:02.889 --> 32:06.627
The Cipactli,
it's an ancient sea monster.

32:06.660 --> 32:09.863
You see all these
little festering pustules

32:09.897 --> 32:12.080
and little craters all over it's belly?

32:12.107 --> 32:14.385
That right there's a veritable shantytown

32:14.417 --> 32:16.987
for those little scarabs from hell.

32:17.021 --> 32:19.022
They live inside the thing.

32:19.055 --> 32:22.092
Professor, I don't really
care about that right now.

32:22.126 --> 32:25.562
My brother is one of them.
How do we stop it?

32:25.596 --> 32:27.365
We find it.

32:27.397 --> 32:30.234
Back in the day, this guy
would park himself in a river

32:30.266 --> 32:33.103
next to a village and he would
contaminate the water supply

32:33.137 --> 32:36.006
till all the villagers
went batshit cannibal.

32:36.040 --> 32:39.109
Based on what we know about
this water treatment facility...

32:41.278 --> 32:44.082
Any of you morons bother
to check underground?

32:44.115 --> 32:46.451
Yeah, I was...

32:46.484 --> 32:49.253
I was getting to that. But
what are you doing alive, man?

32:49.285 --> 32:51.589
Last time I saw you, you blew yourself up.

32:51.621 --> 32:54.324
I gotta give you a point
for that one, mister.

32:54.358 --> 32:56.060
- Yeah, thanks a mil.
- How'd you find us?

32:56.092 --> 32:58.128
This thing has already
started to hit the local news.

32:58.162 --> 32:59.998
Wonderful. So great to have you back.

33:00.031 --> 33:02.099
Kill the messenger, nice. Look...

33:02.132 --> 33:04.034
we wanna get this thing,
we gotta move fast,

33:04.068 --> 33:05.235
before it completes it's task.

33:05.269 --> 33:07.005
What task you talkin' about?

33:07.038 --> 33:09.374
All this poisoning of
the water is just a test.

33:09.407 --> 33:13.144
The Cipactli only sees one
thing, the pure of heart.

33:13.176 --> 33:15.213
The pure of heart? That's not a thing.

33:15.245 --> 33:18.215
Anyone who can resist
the urge to consume flesh

33:18.249 --> 33:19.784
after drinking the water,

33:19.817 --> 33:21.786
- that's the winning ticket.
- OK.

33:21.819 --> 33:24.655
So we gotta spread out and find
somebody who drank the water

33:24.687 --> 33:26.157
and wasn't infected.

33:31.695 --> 33:33.164
I'm gonna need you to play ball, Ranger.

33:49.245 --> 33:50.415
Everything OK, ma'am?

33:52.148 --> 33:53.517
As good as can be expected.

33:58.121 --> 33:58.756
Come here. Come here.

34:24.748 --> 34:26.684
Such a lovely little boy.

34:34.692 --> 34:37.328
- We're too late.
- Wait! You shouldn't go alone.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.163
Let me gather the rest of my guards.

34:39.195 --> 34:41.232
- They've got a head start.
- Why do you always do that?

34:41.264 --> 34:42.567
Not everything is an impulse.

34:48.139 --> 34:49.474
Some things are.

35:07.891 --> 35:09.460
Ah, crap on a cracker.

35:09.493 --> 35:11.529
I meant to bring the harpoon gun.

35:11.561 --> 35:15.699
Ah! Another genius move
from the alleged expert.

35:15.732 --> 35:17.534
If it weren't for me you'd still be

35:17.567 --> 35:21.272
running around upstairs
like a decapitated chicken.

35:21.304 --> 35:24.407
Yeah, well, I'm not the one that
brought a stick to a harpoon fight.

35:36.719 --> 35:38.822
- Holy fuck!
- Shh!

35:39.857 --> 35:41.125
We're close.

36:20.264 --> 36:20.899
Guys!

36:21.898 --> 36:22.866
Whoa!

36:25.402 --> 36:27.338
- There it is.
- Totally pussy.

37:02.739 --> 37:03.707
No! Run!

37:11.281 --> 37:12.816
Don't just stand there. Do something!

37:13.583 --> 37:14.918
Guys!

37:14.951 --> 37:17.354
- Clean shot.
- No! No, no. You'll hit the kid.

37:38.875 --> 37:41.678
I think that fire just pissed him off.

37:41.712 --> 37:44.648
Well, we sure as shit
ain't here to make friends.

37:58.828 --> 38:01.031
That is one ugly Chipotle.

38:52.583 --> 38:54.752
Aim high. This ends now.

39:26.817 --> 39:27.985
Oh, man!

39:49.773 --> 39:52.710
Take one more step and her soul is mine.

39:54.143 --> 39:55.112
Get him out of here!

40:39.156 --> 40:40.493
What happened?

40:40.526 --> 40:43.760
Aside from you trying to kill me,
not much.

40:45.561 --> 40:48.699
Well, I... I guess I owe
you a thank you for...

40:49.472 --> 40:52.441
you know, not killing me.

40:52.507 --> 40:54.190
You know, reality may have changed

40:54.190 --> 40:56.912
a long time ago, Mr. Gecko,
but not enough.

40:58.484 --> 41:00.420
My father is still dead.

41:00.886 --> 41:04.657
One day, you and your psychotic
brother are gonna pay for it.

41:12.263 --> 41:13.064
Fuck.
