WEBVTT

00:02.061 --> 00:03.502
[Thor] Loki?

00:03.578 --> 00:06.321
Hello, Avengers.

00:06.398 --> 00:09.399
You're looking well, I see.

00:09.401 --> 00:11.493
Now, I know we haven't
always gotten along,

00:11.570 --> 00:13.330
but I thought I would
come by and... [grunts]

00:16.408 --> 00:18.759
Listen to me!

00:18.835 --> 00:21.169
I only came to talk!

00:21.247 --> 00:23.671
[grunts]

00:23.749 --> 00:26.025
Gonna smash you good!

00:26.101 --> 00:27.309
[yells]

00:30.089 --> 00:31.750
Another one of your tricks, Loki?
[whimpers]

00:31.774 --> 00:33.482
I'm not here to fight.

00:35.594 --> 00:37.360
I'm here to join you.

00:40.949 --> 00:45.026
The being you call the Beyonder
is a brilliant alien scientist,

00:45.104 --> 00:49.030
but one without ethics
or scruples.

00:49.108 --> 00:52.551
What you're telling us fits
with what we already know.

00:52.628 --> 00:54.127
But why are you helping us?

00:56.540 --> 00:58.799
Because the Beyonder
took apart Asgard

00:58.875 --> 01:00.133
to build his Battleworld.

01:00.210 --> 01:04.212
I thought he would ruin Earth,
but he took my home.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.471
He double-crossed me.

01:05.549 --> 01:08.792
Yeah. Wonder what
that feels like?

01:08.794 --> 01:12.571
Yes, but he did it to me!

01:12.648 --> 01:15.132
Nice to see you,
by the way, Iron Man.

01:15.134 --> 01:16.724
Did you enjoy a nice vacation?

01:16.802 --> 01:18.226
[growling]

01:18.304 --> 01:20.579
Not yet.

01:20.656 --> 01:24.491
Beyonder wants to study
the people he took from Earth,

01:24.568 --> 01:28.403
from Asgard, from across the
universe and other dimensions.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.833
What do you think, Thor?
We cannot trust my brother.

01:32.909 --> 01:34.145
That has been proven
over and over.

01:34.169 --> 01:36.820
But now my Asgard...

01:36.822 --> 01:39.339
Asgard is not yours!

01:39.416 --> 01:42.267
[scoffs] <i>My</i> Asgard

01:42.344 --> 01:44.344
and all the nine realms
are at stake.

01:44.421 --> 01:46.496
I've seen the error of my ways.

01:46.498 --> 01:48.941
Please, you must believe me.

01:49.017 --> 01:50.517
[scoffs] Thor is right.

01:50.594 --> 01:53.612
It makes absolutely no sense
to work with Loki,

01:53.689 --> 01:55.447
but we're gonna have to anyway.

01:55.524 --> 01:58.508
Huh?

01:58.510 --> 02:00.268
Loki says Beyonder
double-crossed him,

02:00.346 --> 02:03.288
which means he knows more than
we do about the situation.

02:03.365 --> 02:04.623
A lot more.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.852
If Loki is stuck here with us,
then he can help us.

02:08.854 --> 02:12.022
This way lies madness!
We cannot trust Loki!

02:12.024 --> 02:13.874
Hold on. We're not trusting him.

02:13.950 --> 02:17.803
But if he's offering to help,
then we're going to use him.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.138
Like it or not.

02:19.214 --> 02:21.756
Avengers Assemble!

02:23.369 --> 02:25.702
Ohh. Terribly sorry.

02:25.704 --> 02:27.637
I was caught up in the moment.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.066 --> 02:57.067
Why does my brother
get to sit inside, up front,

02:57.069 --> 02:59.085
while I'm back here with you?

02:59.162 --> 03:01.087
'Cause your brother
ain't a super-villain.

03:01.164 --> 03:03.164
Now shut up. [Gasps]

03:03.242 --> 03:05.517
[groans]

03:05.594 --> 03:09.170
Are we there yet? Can't we
just fly to where we gotta go?

03:09.248 --> 03:12.766
Beyonder's not the only bad guy
roaming Battleworld.

03:12.842 --> 03:14.229
We'll be harder to spot
if we stay on the ground.

03:14.253 --> 03:17.587
How do we know Loki
isn't leading us into a trap?

03:17.589 --> 03:20.924
For all we know, he could be
working for the Beyonder.

03:20.926 --> 03:23.260
Oh, please. Fine.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.019
Let's clear the air, shall we?

03:25.097 --> 03:26.763
I confess I gave
the Beyonder information.

03:26.765 --> 03:29.783
I was the one who told the Beyonder
about Earth in the first place.

03:29.859 --> 03:33.937
But that is all. I'm not working with him.
That would be ridiculous.

03:33.939 --> 03:37.883
You were the one who told
the Beyonder about Earth?

03:37.960 --> 03:41.720
That does it! I'm gonna smash him and
turn him inside out! [Muffled shouting]

03:41.797 --> 03:43.797
Don't make me come back there.

03:43.873 --> 03:45.949
[growling] Loki's helping us.

03:45.951 --> 03:47.687
If he steps out of line,
then you can smash him.

03:47.711 --> 03:49.344
[gasps]

03:51.457 --> 03:52.380
[growling] [nervous chuckle]

03:52.458 --> 03:54.624
Anyone want to switch seats?

03:54.626 --> 03:59.813
Picking up a signal, but it's weak.
Hard to get a location fix.

03:59.889 --> 04:02.390
We're getting closer.
I can sense it.

04:02.468 --> 04:03.525
That way!

04:14.480 --> 04:16.036
Hmm. Huh?

04:17.815 --> 04:21.000
Uh, guys?

04:21.077 --> 04:23.320
We have to work fast.
Earth is still out there,

04:23.322 --> 04:25.097
but with missing pieces
ripped out of it.

04:25.173 --> 04:29.250
If we don't fix everything, we won't
have a home planet to go back to.

04:29.328 --> 04:31.428
Earth, Asgard...
All will crumble.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.999
[Thor] Impossible.

04:36.001 --> 04:38.443
'Tis New York City!

04:40.930 --> 04:43.006
Most of Battleworld
is like this...

04:43.008 --> 04:46.952
Mixed together by the Beyonder
with no rhyme or reason.

04:47.029 --> 04:49.771
[faint rumbling] It's time again.
We gotta go.

04:49.848 --> 04:51.773
Quick, get inside!
Get inside! All of you!

04:51.850 --> 04:53.850
[panting] The Avengers?

04:53.852 --> 04:56.353
What are you doing?
Get off the street!

04:56.355 --> 04:57.871
[rumbling]

04:57.947 --> 04:59.414
[all grunt, gasp]

05:05.197 --> 05:08.473
[growling]

05:08.550 --> 05:12.811
Rock trolls, from Nidavellir.
Well, they're not mine.

05:12.888 --> 05:17.465
The Beyonder put your city with the
rock trolls, not me. Blame him!

05:17.543 --> 05:19.809
[people clamoring] [growling]

05:22.548 --> 05:24.564
[chuckles, grunts]

05:24.641 --> 05:26.307
[cries out]

05:26.385 --> 05:29.553
These trolls are just
mindless smashers. Aah!

05:29.555 --> 05:34.574
Hulk smashing is more nuanced,
with charm and social commentary.

05:34.651 --> 05:37.502
Yeah. Hulk puts thought
behind punches.

05:37.579 --> 05:40.080
[roars, grunts]

05:40.156 --> 05:44.234
[grunting]

05:44.236 --> 05:46.419
These trolls
are nearly unbreakable.

05:46.496 --> 05:48.347
This will not be easy. [Yells]

05:50.576 --> 05:53.593
You're fighting them?
Pray tell, why?

05:53.670 --> 05:55.239
Just let them destroy
and be done with it.

05:55.263 --> 05:57.689
Because we are Avengers.

05:57.766 --> 06:00.917
We save people. [Grunts]

06:00.919 --> 06:02.361
Mm...

06:04.347 --> 06:05.530
[whimpering] [growling]

06:07.593 --> 06:10.360
"Save people"?
What a bizarre concept.

06:11.688 --> 06:15.356
Come on! Gotta be some setting

06:15.434 --> 06:16.794
or tweak or mod
that'll do the job.

06:23.275 --> 06:25.050
[yells] Forget tech!

06:25.127 --> 06:27.794
Just use brute strength.

06:27.871 --> 06:29.554
Now I'm taking advice
from the Hulk?

06:34.544 --> 06:36.210
[yells] Hulk gives good advice.

06:36.288 --> 06:39.398
[Loki] I could use some assistance!
[growling]

06:44.296 --> 06:45.904
[rock trolls growling]

06:52.487 --> 06:55.580
Dumb rocks! This'll learn ya!

06:55.657 --> 06:57.097
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

07:00.646 --> 07:02.087
Take this with ya! [Grunts]

07:02.164 --> 07:03.705
[growls]

07:05.817 --> 07:07.575
Hmm...

07:07.653 --> 07:08.927
Loki, what are you up to?

07:09.004 --> 07:11.671
I want to try something.

07:11.748 --> 07:13.080
I'm learning here. Be patient.

07:13.158 --> 07:15.842
I haven't been an Avenger
as long as you have.

07:15.919 --> 07:18.511
You are not an Avenger!

07:18.588 --> 07:21.255
Ooh, hit a bit
of a nerve, have I?

07:21.333 --> 07:22.902
Now, be a good jealous brother
and help me.

07:22.926 --> 07:23.926
[frustrated grunt]

07:26.338 --> 07:28.280
[grunts] Thor, now!

07:28.356 --> 07:29.356
[grunts]

07:30.859 --> 07:32.600
[yells]

07:32.678 --> 07:34.944
[grunts]

07:38.183 --> 07:40.684
[groans]

07:40.686 --> 07:43.870
I did well, didn't I?

07:43.947 --> 07:46.289
You almost acted like a hero.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.951
A hero? Ugh!

07:50.028 --> 07:53.029
You just had to ruin
my moment, didn't you?

07:53.031 --> 07:54.547
[Hulk] Still more trolls left.

07:56.368 --> 07:58.125
[woman] Forget them!

07:58.203 --> 07:59.552
You have to get off the street!

08:04.968 --> 08:05.968
The mist is coming.

08:07.896 --> 08:08.896
[growling]

08:11.216 --> 08:13.825
By Odin's beard!

08:19.816 --> 08:22.483
[grunts]

08:22.561 --> 08:24.002
[Iron Man]
Uh-oh. Can't go that way.

08:24.079 --> 08:26.171
There!

08:26.248 --> 08:27.339
Inside there!

08:30.736 --> 08:32.751
Away from the doors!

08:43.081 --> 08:44.523
So what exactly was that?

09:01.116 --> 09:03.099
This makes no sense.

09:03.101 --> 09:07.361
It's like the mist shredded the trolls
to pieces, then melted the pieces.

09:07.439 --> 09:10.698
This evil mist
holds the people captive.

09:10.776 --> 09:12.942
We must stay
and properly defend them!

09:12.944 --> 09:15.779
Are you mad?
We're not here for that.

09:15.781 --> 09:18.281
It's not important
to save your humans.

09:18.283 --> 09:22.060
What is important is that we
find what we are looking for.

09:22.137 --> 09:23.895
[growling] Loki's right.

09:23.972 --> 09:25.805
What? [Iron Man] Your
brother's right.

09:25.882 --> 09:28.049
Thor, once we stop the Beyonder,

09:28.126 --> 09:29.528
we can send these people
back to Earth.

09:29.552 --> 09:30.960
We can save everybody.

09:30.962 --> 09:35.240
How do we know Loki is not
responsible for the mist,

09:35.317 --> 09:36.223
or the rock trolls?

09:36.301 --> 09:39.727
Why would I do that?

09:39.805 --> 09:42.322
Battleworld was put together
by the Beyonder.

09:42.398 --> 09:44.474
He is the guilty party.
All I am trying to do

09:44.476 --> 09:46.326
is help find the...
[breathing heavily]

09:46.402 --> 09:50.071
[sighs] I'm sorry. It's very
difficult to concentrate

09:50.148 --> 09:52.591
on defending my integrity with
Hulk looking at me like that.

09:52.667 --> 09:53.916
[continues breathing heavily]

09:56.746 --> 09:58.655
[clears throat]

09:58.657 --> 10:00.098
Hello there, Miss...

10:00.175 --> 10:02.767
Call me Elsa.

10:02.844 --> 10:04.919
Well, Miss Call Me Elsa,
we're new in town.

10:04.996 --> 10:08.940
What can you tell us about what's
been happening here? Wish I knew.

10:09.017 --> 10:12.110
There was a big flash of light.
Next thing you know, we're here,

10:12.187 --> 10:15.280
trapped by the mist that comes from
the cavern inside the mountain.

10:15.357 --> 10:17.115
What we seek isn't in the city.

10:17.192 --> 10:20.026
It must be deeper below.

10:20.103 --> 10:22.436
Cavern is... that way?

10:22.514 --> 10:24.072
I'll take you there.

10:28.036 --> 10:30.611
We cannot avoid
the issue at hand.

10:30.689 --> 10:33.189
I know. When this is over,

10:33.191 --> 10:35.449
I gotta ask Elsa
if she's seeing anybody.

10:35.527 --> 10:37.694
This is more important
than your next date.

10:37.696 --> 10:41.122
Says you. A woman like
that is... [groans]

10:41.199 --> 10:43.216
You were saying? Issue at hand?

10:43.292 --> 10:45.810
Loki. I've always
tried to help him,

10:45.887 --> 10:47.646
in case he ever truly
had a change of heart.

10:47.722 --> 10:51.483
I've long given up hope
that Loki will ever change.

10:51.559 --> 10:53.801
You can't fix other people.

10:53.879 --> 10:55.895
When someone like your brother
is flailing,

10:55.972 --> 11:00.216
it's not your job
to rescue them from themselves.

11:00.218 --> 11:04.145
It's your job to be there for them when
they're ready to get their life together.

11:04.222 --> 11:06.389
When I was lost
in another dimension,

11:06.391 --> 11:08.741
I never lost hope
in the people I care about.

11:08.818 --> 11:10.410
Don't you lose hope, Thor.

11:10.486 --> 11:14.564
Sometimes hope is all we've got.

11:14.566 --> 11:17.250
You know, I can
hear both of you.

11:17.326 --> 11:20.069
[grunting softly] [angry groan]

11:20.071 --> 11:21.346
[groans louder]

11:21.423 --> 11:22.681
[blow lands] [grunts]

11:22.757 --> 11:26.259
Stop that! Make me.

11:26.335 --> 11:28.353
[scoffs] That is not fair.
If I do that,

11:28.430 --> 11:29.913
you'll just use that
as an excuse to hit me!

11:29.915 --> 11:33.674
Loki raised his voice at me.
Now do I get to smash him?

11:33.752 --> 11:36.194
No!

11:37.680 --> 11:39.030
[all grunt]

11:39.107 --> 11:42.926
The tunnel!
It's not just the tunnel.

11:42.928 --> 11:44.610
The entire mountain
is coming down!

11:44.687 --> 11:47.280
We're not gonna make it.

11:47.356 --> 11:48.356
[grunts] [grunts]

11:51.436 --> 11:53.527
Yes, we are!

11:53.605 --> 11:54.787
[yells] [grunts]

11:56.441 --> 11:58.274
[roaring]

11:58.276 --> 11:59.609
[grunts]

11:59.611 --> 12:03.463
Bracing it!
Not sure for how long!

12:03.539 --> 12:05.131
Get Elsa somewhere safe!

12:05.208 --> 12:09.343
Sensors show a stable section this way!
Twenty meters!

12:11.957 --> 12:14.733
Well, I made a dent. Thor!

12:14.809 --> 12:16.234
[straining] [yells]

12:21.132 --> 12:22.982
Party's over! Everybody out!

12:23.059 --> 12:24.909
[Hulk continues straining]
Hmm...

12:26.972 --> 12:29.581
Look at you.

12:29.657 --> 12:32.083
You're not that strong, are you, Hulk?
[chuckles]

12:32.160 --> 12:33.993
Why, I bet I'm even
stronger than you.

12:34.070 --> 12:35.569
Loki, Hulk, hurry!

12:35.647 --> 12:37.981
Loki!

12:37.983 --> 12:40.500
Quiet, you! All that talk

12:40.576 --> 12:42.835
about how you're
the strongest there is.

12:42.912 --> 12:44.596
But you couldn't hurt
a fly, could you,

12:44.672 --> 12:46.914
little green kitty-cat?

12:46.992 --> 12:48.749
Mew! Mew!

12:48.827 --> 12:52.161
Hulk is not a kitty-cat! [Yells]

12:52.163 --> 12:55.607
I'm not frightened of you,
big green baby!

12:55.683 --> 12:59.669
[grunts]
Gonna... smash... you...

12:59.671 --> 13:03.856
into... tiny... pieces! [Yells]

13:03.933 --> 13:06.859
Ooh! You want to smash me?

13:06.936 --> 13:09.012
Well, what's stopping you?

13:09.014 --> 13:10.288
[grunts]

13:10.365 --> 13:12.281
[yells, grunts]

13:16.521 --> 13:18.296
We're alive!

13:18.373 --> 13:20.965
Loki! I'm dead.

13:21.042 --> 13:24.118
You did that on purpose.

13:24.195 --> 13:26.863
You knew making me mad
makes me stronger.

13:26.865 --> 13:29.257
And you're not going
to smash me, right?

13:30.960 --> 13:32.644
I might. We're here.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.816
There it is!

13:37.892 --> 13:40.710
[Thor] The Bifrost!
[Elsa] What's that?

13:40.712 --> 13:42.045
The Bifrost
allows people to travel

13:42.047 --> 13:45.381
between Asgard
and the nine realms.

13:45.383 --> 13:47.492
But the Beyonder
altered its purpose

13:47.569 --> 13:49.569
and used it to transport
parts of worlds

13:49.645 --> 13:51.888
and build his Battleworld.

13:51.890 --> 13:54.165
So, if we reverse the process,

13:54.242 --> 13:56.225
we can use it
to send the worlds away

13:56.227 --> 13:58.227
and put everything back
as it was.

13:58.229 --> 13:59.912
Huh?

13:59.989 --> 14:03.916
Hey, lady, you're too close to the mists!
Get out of there!

14:03.993 --> 14:05.993
Oh, you Avengers are
delightful when you're stupid.

14:08.573 --> 14:10.590
And you're delightful
all the time.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.575
Enchantress?

14:12.577 --> 14:16.095
Ohhh, so this is
what it feels like

14:16.172 --> 14:18.915
to be on the hero end
of a villainous double cross.

14:18.917 --> 14:21.175
Well, I don't care for it.

14:21.252 --> 14:24.028
[Iron Man] You don't seem very
bothered by the mist, Enchantress.

14:24.105 --> 14:26.197
What, this?

14:26.274 --> 14:28.608
No, you see, the mist isn't
dangerous at all. [Growling]

14:28.684 --> 14:32.762
It's what's hiding inside of
it you should be afraid of.

14:32.764 --> 14:35.206
The Bifrost is going to get me
out of this forsaken place.

14:35.283 --> 14:38.025
It's been a fun
little adventure together,

14:38.103 --> 14:40.453
but this is where I leave you.
[growling]

14:40.529 --> 14:43.039
Leave you to your doom. [Roars]

14:45.627 --> 14:49.387
[creatures growling]

14:49.464 --> 14:51.222
These things
do not look friendly.

14:51.299 --> 14:53.540
[grunts]

14:53.618 --> 14:55.393
[grunts]

14:55.470 --> 14:57.053
[growling]

14:59.641 --> 15:02.216
[laughing]

15:02.293 --> 15:04.068
Fight hard, Avengers.

15:04.145 --> 15:07.405
If their teeth don't get you,
their acid will.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.407
[grunting]

15:09.484 --> 15:12.076
[cries out]

15:12.153 --> 15:13.986
Protect your flank, Loki!
[grunts]

15:15.473 --> 15:16.397
[growling]

15:16.474 --> 15:19.992
Don't tell me
what to do, brother.

15:20.069 --> 15:21.586
Oh, and protect your flank.

15:21.663 --> 15:22.663
[growling] [grunts]

15:25.650 --> 15:28.151
[grunts]

15:28.153 --> 15:30.094
Hey, don't scratch up
my new armor!

15:32.323 --> 15:34.098
Hey, batter, batter!
Swing, batter!

15:34.175 --> 15:36.768
Heimdall uses his sword
for this sort of thing.

15:36.844 --> 15:40.271
There must be some other way
to turn on the Bifrost.

15:40.348 --> 15:42.440
[grunts] [growling]

15:42.517 --> 15:44.517
Loki!

15:44.593 --> 15:46.927
What is he up to?

15:47.005 --> 15:48.604
[growling continues]

15:51.342 --> 15:53.267
Out of my way, vermin! [Grunts]

15:53.344 --> 15:59.791
For I am Loki,
and I have places to go!

15:59.867 --> 16:03.035
Ah, Loki.
Your timing couldn't be better.

16:03.112 --> 16:05.204
Be a dear friend
and get this Bifrost working.

16:05.281 --> 16:06.281
Mm...

16:09.694 --> 16:12.695
I'm impressed, Loki.

16:12.697 --> 16:14.973
You got the Avengers
to bring you down here.

16:15.049 --> 16:17.550
You truly are
the master of deceit.

16:17.626 --> 16:19.385
[chuckles] I am.

16:19.462 --> 16:23.873
But I didn't trick them this time.
I wanted to help them.

16:23.875 --> 16:27.376
I'm going to use the Bifrost to undo
Battleworld, just like I promised.

16:27.378 --> 16:28.644
You're helping them?

16:31.065 --> 16:33.274
[growling]

16:36.387 --> 16:40.389
This newfound nobility of
yours... it's not an act!

16:40.391 --> 16:42.000
I'm as surprised as you.

16:42.076 --> 16:46.004
Oh, they might not have
come to terms with me yet.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.520
But I'm an Avenger now...
[cries out]

16:47.565 --> 16:49.081
[groans]

16:49.158 --> 16:53.419
I hate to do this to you,
but you're one of them now.

16:53.496 --> 16:57.015
[groaning]

16:57.091 --> 16:58.758
So you deserve this.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.634
[cries out]

17:02.947 --> 17:04.262
Loki! [Growling]

17:07.752 --> 17:09.977
I'll take that.

17:14.108 --> 17:17.017
[grunts] I won't be stuck
on this infernal world.

17:17.095 --> 17:19.203
Not for one moment more!

17:19.280 --> 17:20.854
What's going on?
This isn't right!

17:20.932 --> 17:23.933
Something has tampered
with the Bifrost. [Gasps]

17:23.935 --> 17:25.534
[screaming]

17:30.032 --> 17:31.607
[grunting]

17:31.609 --> 17:34.610
One for you! One for you!

17:34.612 --> 17:35.628
Hey, stay down!

17:35.704 --> 17:37.379
[growls] [yells]

17:41.786 --> 17:43.877
Loki! [Grunting]

17:43.955 --> 17:47.398
Enchantress stabbed me in the back.
[chuckles]

17:47.475 --> 17:50.234
I never knew being an Avenger
would be this painful.

17:54.632 --> 17:55.907
[both grunt]

17:55.983 --> 17:58.317
[grunting]

18:00.305 --> 18:02.080
The way out's been blocked.

18:02.156 --> 18:03.915
That's somewhat inconvenient.

18:03.991 --> 18:05.658
Then we make a new way out!

18:05.734 --> 18:07.919
[grunting]

18:07.995 --> 18:09.253
Thor, Loki, time to go!

18:10.982 --> 18:13.833
[grunts]

18:13.909 --> 18:15.376
Loki!

18:18.156 --> 18:20.431
[grunts]

18:20.508 --> 18:24.160
Leave it! We have to get
out before it's too late!

18:24.162 --> 18:26.512
I can almost reach it.

18:26.589 --> 18:32.184
Once I activate the Bifrost,
I can save Asgard and Earth.

18:32.261 --> 18:34.428
Loki, let it go.

18:34.505 --> 18:38.265
It destroyed Enchantress.
It will destroy you too.

18:38.343 --> 18:40.952
Don't sacrifice
your life for this.

18:41.028 --> 18:44.530
This is our only chance!

18:44.607 --> 18:47.575
Brother, we will find
another way, together.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.794
[Iron Man] The people
of New York are safe.

19:07.872 --> 19:11.056
And they'll stay safe, because the
mists and the creatures in it

19:11.133 --> 19:13.484
are gone for good.

19:13.561 --> 19:15.544
And yet it is still
no cause for celebration,

19:15.546 --> 19:19.064
for we lost the Bifrost.
[Beyonder] Here's the thing.

19:19.141 --> 19:21.659
It was never yours to lose.

19:21.736 --> 19:24.069
[Iron Man] Beyonder. Iron Man.

19:24.146 --> 19:27.740
The one who's been dodging my
sensors and roaming my Battleworld.

19:27.816 --> 19:32.561
We meet at last. The Bifrost
was never gonna work.

19:32.563 --> 19:35.898
Not without my tech.
I left it behind as a trap

19:35.900 --> 19:38.067
to draw out troublemakers
trying to undo my work.

19:38.069 --> 19:39.735
Troublemakers like you.

19:39.737 --> 19:41.345
[all cry out]

19:41.422 --> 19:42.663
Did you think

19:42.740 --> 19:46.017
you could sneak around
ruining my experiment?

19:46.093 --> 19:48.093
Did you think you could leave?

19:48.170 --> 19:50.837
Battleworld is my realm! Mine!

19:50.915 --> 19:53.416
I've been studying your tech.

19:53.418 --> 19:54.917
It's brilliant.
You know you're a genius.

19:54.919 --> 19:58.196
And you know that if you don't
put it back together again,

19:58.272 --> 20:02.608
Earth, Asgard, the other
worlds... they're going to die.

20:02.685 --> 20:04.869
And that's supposed
to bother me?

20:04.946 --> 20:06.573
They're not my planets.
They're not my people.

20:06.597 --> 20:09.448
No, they are ours.

20:09.525 --> 20:11.600
[all cry out]

20:11.602 --> 20:15.379
I have you to thank for
pointing Earth out to me, Loki,

20:15.456 --> 20:17.882
but I owe you nothing,
especially now.

20:17.959 --> 20:21.610
[sighs] After all I heard
about the Avengers,

20:21.612 --> 20:23.554
this was the best
you could muster?

20:23.631 --> 20:25.223
Wow. Talk about disappointing.

20:28.953 --> 20:30.619
[roars, grunts]

20:30.621 --> 20:32.638
[straining]

20:32.715 --> 20:34.881
[grunts] I promised you

20:34.959 --> 20:38.461
that if you came at me again,
I would rip you in two.

20:38.463 --> 20:41.146
I keep my word.

20:41.223 --> 20:42.481
[crying out]

20:48.230 --> 20:49.914
[continues crying out]

20:54.161 --> 20:56.328
Bruce! Hulk!

20:56.405 --> 20:59.815
[laughs] I am brilliant!

20:59.817 --> 21:02.001
[laughs]
Now you see it, now you don't.

21:06.007 --> 21:08.582
Let me explain
how things work here

21:08.659 --> 21:11.269
in a way your simple minds
can understand.

21:11.345 --> 21:14.997
Here on Battleworld,
you... are nothing.

21:14.999 --> 21:17.924
I am in control,
and I am in charge.

21:18.002 --> 21:20.927
You will play along,

21:21.005 --> 21:24.615
or I will tear
the rest of you apart,

21:24.692 --> 21:32.692
one after the other.
