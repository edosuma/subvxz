like when we first met
on Chatroulette.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.476
When we first connected,
fell in love,

01:50.478 --> 01:52.845
and the sparks flew
when I asked you those deep,

01:52.847 --> 01:55.747
personal questions like,
what were those? Oh yeah,

01:55.749 --> 01:58.117
- age, sex, location?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:58.119 --> 02:01.220
Hey Logan, I'm ready to take
this to the next level.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.457
Oh yes, here we go.

02:08.795 --> 02:09.828
Come on, old friend.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.797
Who are you talking to?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.665
Just a second freshening up.

02:16.370 --> 02:21.173
Okay, okay, babe, now
these are for your eyes only.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.842
Yeah, don't worry babe,
it's just me.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.215
Do you have any almond milk?

02:31.619 --> 02:33.719
Uh... you were jerking off.

02:33.721 --> 02:37.523
Come on man! You shouldn't just
burst into people's rooms like that.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.391
And you shouldn't be jerking
off in the middle of the day

02:39.393 --> 02:41.894
with your door unlocked
and all your friends downstairs.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.263
Now, do you have
almond milk or not?

02:44.532 --> 02:47.499
Come on man, it's next
to my socks, you know that.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.767
Yo we're drinking up.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.772
Sorry about that babe.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.741
Okay.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.645
- Who was that?
- Oh.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.314
That would be Juanpa,
my foreign exchange brother

03:02.316 --> 03:04.416
who's overstayed
his welcome by a decade!

03:04.785 --> 03:07.186
What about your real
brother, Jake?

03:07.188 --> 03:08.453
Oh.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.889
Disney got him. Okay.

03:11.292 --> 03:14.459
- Argh. The moment's ruined babe, don't you think?
- No, no babe, um...

03:14.461 --> 03:16.562
Okay, just, okay... How about
this? Take a deep breath.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.830
Asasasa!

03:18.832 --> 03:21.767
Okay close your eyes, close your
eyes, that's right okay. Now...

03:22.703 --> 03:26.471
Imagine our second date, remember all
the sexy shit I was typing to you?

03:26.473 --> 03:28.373
I sent you that sexy
picture with the pineapple

03:28.375 --> 03:31.210
over my penis and I blamed it
on auto correct.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.278
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- It wasn't auto correct.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.380
- I said it.
- Okay, okay.

03:35.382 --> 03:40.285
My turn, imagine
we're together... alone.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.955
I'm standing right next to you.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.857
you can feel my body on yours

03:45.859 --> 03:49.261
- and I whisper in your ear...
- Smile, you're on camera!

03:49.263 --> 03:51.383
Lele,

03:51.699 --> 03:53.865
This is gonna be the best video ever!

03:53.867 --> 03:55.334
Delete that now!

03:55.336 --> 03:56.868
No, it's gonna get
a million likes.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.303
It's not all about likes
you know.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.700
What, are you fucking stupid?

04:15.456 --> 04:18.322
Delete, delete,
delete it, Lele, delete it!

04:18.325 --> 04:19.992
Logan, are you all right?

04:28.335 --> 04:31.436
Suck it, bitch!

04:40.648 --> 04:42.648

Thanks buddy.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.961
Sorry about that, babe.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.964
Oh man can't get
any privacy around here.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.634
- Okay.
- Hey Logan, you seen the email?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.870
What! Ow! Ah!

05:04.872 --> 05:09.441

- No, no, no, no, no.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.911
Fuck, man.
I was getting somewhere.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.781
Bro what are you... what are you in
here doing man, I worry about you.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.517
That's not your girlfriend,
she's not a real girlfriend,

05:18.519 --> 05:20.419
she's a computer girlfriend.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.754
Huge difference,
real girlfriend, ump-ump

05:22.756 --> 05:25.057
computer girlfriend, eh-eh-eh,
you know what I'm saying?

05:25.059 --> 05:26.992
- Yeah.
- And I hate to break it down

05:26.994 --> 05:28.727
but your girlfriend
probably got a dick.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.430
This convention is gonna
be the fucking tits!

05:31.432 --> 05:32.831
What convention?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.833
You didn't hear about #acon?

05:34.835 --> 05:37.402
Bro it's the biggest social
media convention ever.

05:38.339 --> 05:41.640
Yeah man, #acon.
Everyone's gonna be there.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.876
It's gonna be awesome.
How do you not know about this?

05:48.415 --> 05:50.749
Okay, uh, seriously,
what is #acon?

05:50.751 --> 05:53.018
Who the hell cares,
people get laid at conventions.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.119
- Yeah they do.
- Okay.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.387
- Really?
- Huh.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.890
- Is that like a thing?
- Is that what, was that English?

05:58.892 --> 06:01.059
Like a thing,
sorry, I was born in Mexico.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.862
Yeah, that's literally why they
invented conventions, so you can fuck.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.631
It's like the only place you can cheat
on your wife and get a free gift basket.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.034
The gift baskets,
uh, but the cheating.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.704
- So this means...
- You can have sex finally.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.638
Ooh.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.410
No more virginity!

06:20.681 --> 06:23.115
- Yeah Juanpa.
- I'm not gonna be a virgin, Logan!

06:23.117 --> 06:26.017

the same fucking flight.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.021
- Are you ready, man?
- What, no, no, no. What...

06:30.023 --> 06:32.491

08:21.134 --> 08:24.169
It's time to get over
your fear of flying, man.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.671
If you won't do it for her,
do it for my virginity.

to tear up Australia with you.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.048
- Australia?
- Yeah, but it's fine,

08:37.049 --> 08:38.984
I'll just call a hooker

08:38.986 --> 08:41.586
- It's in Australia?
- Yeah, bro, Australia.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.554

You throw them away

09:05.746 --> 09:07.679
"Hey, can I suck your
dick, mate?" I'm like,

09:07.681 --> 09:08.813
"Yeah, you can do it.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.248
Now put your back into it".

09:11.118 --> 09:12.617
- Alright.
- Uh-huh.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.885
I know I'm gonna regret this.

Ah! That's amazing, babe,
you're gonna love it here, I promise.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.668
I dunno I heard actually
it's pretty gnarly.

09:30.003 --> 09:33.271
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- Like deadly spiders, and snakes and shit.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.674
Oh yeah, we've got
a lot of spiders.

09:35.876 --> 09:39.678
- But they're not like everywhere, right?
- Yeah, look it.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.115
Holy shi...

09:47.955 --> 09:50.221
This is my spider stick.

09:50.857 --> 09:53.158
You're so brave for coming
to Australia, Logan,

09:53.160 --> 09:57.028
- I can't believe you're coming.
- I am absolutely terrified but I'm coming.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.298
Crikey, I have to go, bye.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.070
Okay.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.938
Time to say goodbye, old friend.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.043
One more time
for old time's sake.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.080
No. You're making this
harder than it has to be.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.082
That's what I was hoping for.

10:17.851 --> 10:21.019
- Fine, but don't tell Ariel.
- I never would.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.155
- Thanks.
- That bitch is gonna die.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.361
- What?
- I mean... Uh... I was made to fly.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.930
Anyways, er,

Shut, shut the fuck up.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.357

- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.660
Holy shit. Yo,
Vitaly's on our flight.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.828
Apparently he's gonna

11:03.830 --> 11:06.364
Wait.
Why is Vitaly going to stand trial?

11:06.366 --> 11:07.932
Look if you weren't
so knee deep in

Ah, shit.

Ew.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.516
Auto correct.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.686

- No.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.555
Yeah, yeah you were.

16:30.557 --> 16:34.258
No, I... I mean, yeah I was
but it's my mom.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.160
You're staring at a naked
photo of your mom?

16:36.363 --> 16:39.197
- No! Yes. Look I... I mean...

- Hi Logan, I'm Jenna.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.478
- What?
- Okay, well, I'm...

16:55.615 --> 16:57.515

17:01.154 --> 17:02.453
Yeah, me to.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.790

barley notice it.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.602
You're so handsome,

17:51.604 --> 17:54.205

the merry go around.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.630
Ah, cool.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.668
Oh, by the way I don't
mean to scare you

18:23.670 --> 18:27.205

19:33.907 --> 19:35.239

23:30.510 --> 23:32.610
I'm getting as far away
from that cheating prick

23:32.612 --> 23:34.445
as possible, hence Australia.

23:35.148 --> 23:37.615
Oh damn, my bad.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.866
You know I know what it's
like to be cheated on.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.655
Yeah this one time during
midterms this Asian girl

23:44.657 --> 23:46.090
kept looking over
at all my answers.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.959
Which I ironic you know
because she's Asian,

23:52.131 --> 23:52.913
I should be cheating off of her.

23:52.914 --> 23:53.696
But it... I see how
that's different now

23:53.699 --> 23:56.434
that the words have come
out of my mouth.

23:56.702 --> 23:57.702
What's your Instagram?

23:58.771 --> 23:59.970
I don't have social media.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.706
What do you mean
when you say that?

24:02.975 --> 24:05.476
I mean like I'd rather just
be living my life instead of

24:05.478 --> 24:09.613
- worrying if people are gonna like and comment on it.
- Wow.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.983
- Are you with the #amegacon thing?
- No, no, kind of, no.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.753
- Wow.
- No, no. I'm actually going to Australia

24:15.755 --> 24:17.087
to visit my girlfriend
for the first time.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.622
Your girlfriend's
a computer!

24:18.624 --> 24:19.990
Fuck you, Lele.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.659
Check out how pretty she is.

24:21.661 --> 24:24.128
- Home screen.
- Whew! Home screen official.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.030
Yeah, she's, she's gorgeous.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.505
Hey, boys.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.640
Oh my god. Oh!

24:36.909 --> 24:41.011
I am so sorry. Oh jeez,
sorry, sorry about that okay.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.516
Oh. Huh.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.751
This would happen to me
on my first day.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.153

one of my nipples?

26:54.714 --> 26:57.147

26:57.350 --> 26:59.617

26:59.619 --> 27:02.152
Here's the deal, you are
a skinny, ratchet ass,

27:02.154 --> 27:04.755
basic bitch who goes

27:04.757 --> 27:07.024
- and will put anything in her mouth, got it?
- What?

27:07.026 --> 27:10.060
Take your brunette

27:10.062 --> 27:12.296
weird, Selena Gomez
look alike bullshit,

27:12.298 --> 27:15.766
- go get on your phone and go find a cock to suck.
- Well...

27:15.768 --> 27:18.402
Shhh. You're a basic bitch,
get out of my liquor.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.389
- Coffee, sir?
- Yes please.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.058
Okay and how would you like it?

27:41.060 --> 27:44.294
Like I like my women,
black and full of cream.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.266
You kiss like my dad.

27:49.268 --> 27:53.003
- Let's just pretend you didn't say that, okay?
- Okay.

27:55.675 --> 27:56.675
There you go.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.077
The fuck?

28:04.784 --> 28:05.784
You're next.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.153
Hey, guys just wanted
to let you know

28:09.155 --> 28:11.889
I didn't see anything,
you're still going.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.824
You're still going
at it. Okay, sorry.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.159
I still didn't see anything.

28:16.729 --> 28:21.432
Oh, ho-ho-ho. There you are.

28:21.434 --> 28:25.703
Oh, you're an escape artist
just like your daddy.

28:25.705 --> 28:26.870
Mm. Huh?

28:29.408 --> 28:30.574
Yeah.

28:30.575 --> 28:31.741
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where are my manners,

28:31.744 --> 28:33.377
you must be hungry comrade, huh?

28:33.946 --> 28:35.746
You want some banana, huh?

28:35.748 --> 28:37.381
You want a little banana?
Here you go.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.883
Why don't you eat that,
there you go.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.151
Why
don't you take that all?

28:41.153 --> 28:42.419
Yeah that's what I thought,

28:42.421 --> 28:43.821
that's what I thought.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.757
You want some cheese, pal,
you got cheese in Russia?

28:47.026 --> 28:48.826
Oh, you got a built in
cheese grater right there,

28:48.828 --> 28:50.094
look at you, huh, look at you.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.029
What does that
taste like, borsht?

28:52.031 --> 28:54.732
What else? Oh, Choco-taco.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.267
I hope you're not dairy
intolerant there, Ruski.

28:57.269 --> 29:01.438
How's that? Oh yeah, oh yeah.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.075
What the fuck you
looking at, Aladdin?

29:05.077 --> 29:06.410
Nothing, what's your problem?

29:06.412 --> 29:08.245
I got no problem,
I'm just racist.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.448
I do respect queers though.
They've been through a lot.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.050
Now you got that gay marriage.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.692
Used to be what they'd do
is illegal.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.007
Now they got shows about it.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.756
- I binge watch.
- Okay, dude.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.192
Is he still looking? Yeah.

29:26.232 --> 29:29.066
And that's how I lost 15
percent of my right testicle.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.402
Yup, a dwarf in a Godzilla
costume, can you imagine?

29:32.404 --> 29:35.372
I don't have to imagine,
you just told me every last detail.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.086
There's nothing more I could
possibly learn about your balls.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.879
Oh you'd be surprised, they could do a
whole 60 minute special on my balls.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.481
Does your Internet girlfriend know
about your deflated testicle?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.151
It's not deflated and no,

29:47.153 --> 29:48.919
we have not crossed
that bridge yet.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.821
Alright, I'm sorry I got to ask,

29:50.823 --> 29:53.524
how can you love someone
you never actually met?

29:54.226 --> 29:57.261
- She makes me snort.
- What?

29:57.263 --> 29:59.296
She's funny, she's got
a great sense of humor,

29:59.298 --> 30:02.299
- I know it's cheesy but...
- Bro, I could make you snort in two seconds.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.901
No you could not, okay.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.903
It's practically impossible
to make me laugh.

30:06.272 --> 30:09.239
It takes someone creative,
it takes someone original.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.241
- Got to make a good joke to make me laugh.
- Argh!

30:17.049 --> 30:20.951
- Aw. Does this mean that you love me?
- Ah...

30:28.260 --> 30:31.428
By the way, thanks
for pepping me up earlier.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.431
I know it may not have seemed
like much but it really helped.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.966
Yeah, yeah, no problem Logan.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.602
Alright, I am going to
try to get some sleep

30:38.604 --> 30:40.437
and hopefully
not dream of dwarfzilla.

30:40.439 --> 30:41.605
Or swollen balls.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.907
- Yeah.
- Am I right?

30:43.909 --> 30:45.509
Yeah, okay goodnight.

30:46.412 --> 30:51.014
I'm gonna nominate your
shoulder as my pillow, okay.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.963
Did you really just wipe
your snot on my shoulder?

31:07.266 --> 31:08.266
No.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.000
Is this shit?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.604
Oh, okay, thank God.

31:29.655 --> 31:34.191
Hey, I have noticed that
the seatbelt sign has been off

31:34.193 --> 31:37.227
for the last several hours
and I just think that... Oh!

31:37.529 --> 31:39.229
That is very unprofessional

31:39.231 --> 31:41.531
and unsafe and Jesus Christ

31:41.533 --> 31:43.967
are you gonna suck his dick
all the way to Australia?

31:44.436 --> 31:45.936
Fuck it! I'll finish him off.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.074
Oh my god!

32:04.290 --> 32:05.989
We need your assistance
in the cockpit, sir.

32:05.991 --> 32:07.257
Are you fucking kidding me?

32:07.259 --> 32:11.328
Sir, we <i> really</i> need your
assistance in the cockpit.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.963
You're crazy
if you think I'm gonna let

32:12.965 --> 32:15.098
this soviet psychopath
sit back here alone.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.268
Sir, with all due respect
this is more important.

32:19.204 --> 32:20.537
Do you know what this
guy's capable of?

32:20.539 --> 32:22.639
He is the reason you have
your privates scanned

32:22.641 --> 32:25.676
at the airport, and I hate
having my privates scanned.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.412
I had my dick lobbed off
by a pottery wheel.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.248
Now my dick looks like the stump
at the end of the giving tree.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.250
Oh.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.119
If you so much as flinch

32:36.121 --> 32:38.555
I will make you a member
of the dick stump club.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.558
There are three of us.

32:43.662 --> 32:44.728
We meet on Wednesdays.

32:45.698 --> 32:46.698
Damn it.

33:06.719 --> 33:09.519
- What the fuck is on his mouth?
- I just thought they were making oral love,

33:09.521 --> 33:12.122
- I had no idea that they were...
- Oh you had no idea.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.657
- You had no idea?
- No.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.159
TAS article 1219 clearly states

33:16.161 --> 33:19.730
- no pilot shall engage in dick suckery without a spotter.
- What?

33:19.732 --> 33:21.999
- Dick suckery?
- How would I know that?

33:22.001 --> 33:24.401
- Cause that's your job.
- It's not my job. - Is everything okay?

33:24.636 --> 33:25.435
Hey, go back to your seat. ok?

33:25.437 --> 33:26.703
Go back to your seat now

33:26.705 --> 33:28.071
or I'm gonna tase
you till you shit.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.106
What happened to the pilots?

33:29.108 --> 33:30.307
Hey look, just be quiet, okay,

33:30.309 --> 33:31.742
we don't want
the rest of the plane

33:31.744 --> 33:33.243
to know the pilots are dead,
we're fucked.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.312
Dead, the pilots are dead?

33:36.215 --> 33:38.682
- Holy fucking shit.
- I came in here. And I found them like that and I was like,

33:38.684 --> 33:40.684
"Oh my god what do I do",
and then I went and got him.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.252
- And now it's...
- Alright listen. Shut up, shut up

33:42.254 --> 33:43.787
both of you calm down,
okay? Listen to me.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.656
- Hey over here, over here, over here.
- Ok, ok.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.693
Listen to me, okay, I'm trained
for situations like this.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.361
You go get me a car battery,

33:51.363 --> 33:53.397
a tourniquet, and a bendy straw.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.465
I'll have these zombie
pilots flying in no time.

33:55.467 --> 33:59.102
Sir, we don't have
anymore bendy straws.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.038
- Oh fuck!
- Fuck.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.506
- Alright.
- We are so fucked.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.174
I'm just gonna have
to land this plane myself.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.210
- You can fly?
- There are two things in my life that I love.

34:07.513 --> 34:08.779
Flying jets and pottery.

34:08.781 --> 34:10.614
- I gave my dick for it.
- Oh.

34:10.616 --> 34:13.250
I'm gonna land this plane
and we're gonna be just fine.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.085
Argh!

34:17.556 --> 34:18.621
Holy shit.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.699
- Ahh.
- Hey boss had a bit of radio silence

34:29.701 --> 34:31.668
from flight 1524
from Los Angeles.

34:31.670 --> 34:35.172
Oi, well you know what they say,
"Silence is golden", huh,

34:35.174 --> 34:38.141
especially from Los Angeles.
Bunch of fucking hippies.

34:38.710 --> 34:42.112
Hipsters. What the fuck
is Coachella anyway?

34:44.083 --> 34:45.315
Where's my baby?

34:49.788 --> 34:53.356
Is that a baby? Is that a baby?

34:55.127 --> 34:56.293
Oh shit.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.228
Have you seen my baby?

34:58.230 --> 34:59.396
A baby.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.134
Hi baby.

35:04.136 --> 35:05.469
Have you seen my baby?

35:06.271 --> 35:07.304
Have you see my baby?

35:07.306 --> 35:09.106
What did I find?

35:09.641 --> 35:13.410
Aw, you look starving. Come on.

35:15.681 --> 35:19.616
Sir, sir... hi, as much as
I love that Versace blouse

35:19.618 --> 35:22.152
you are cannot breast feed
that baby right here.

35:22.888 --> 35:23.888
Really?

35:24.456 --> 35:26.223
Well I think I can breast feed

35:26.225 --> 35:30.127
this random baby
wherever the fuck I want.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.728
- No you can't. No you can't.
- Okay?

35:31.730 --> 35:34.231
God gave me nipples
and I'll be damned

35:34.233 --> 35:35.665
if I don't use them, okay?

35:35.667 --> 35:37.517
Okay, well,
little science lesson,

35:37.518 --> 35:39.368
men don't produce breast milk
incidentally so, ah.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.338
Aw, oh, no.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.274
It's a miracle.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.909
Oh God, you're a squirter.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.178
Yeah, yeah milk facial.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.213
Who wants a milk mask?

35:50.215 --> 35:51.681
I didn't, uh, sir
I didn't realize.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.650
Wait, open your mouth
one more time. Ah.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.452
Oh, oh, okay. Oh.

35:55.454 --> 35:57.554
What's that?
That's not diet Coke, bitch.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.690
A little in the mouth,
okay never mind thank you.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.460
Idiot.

36:04.796 --> 36:05.796
Hi, how are you?

36:06.565 --> 36:07.731
This is my baby.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.568
You want some milk?

36:11.904 --> 36:13.624
I got two of these motherfuckers
right here.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.355
Oh shit, I have a boner.

36:34.760 --> 36:38.929
Oh no, no, no, no.
Oh no, no, no.

36:39.765 --> 36:43.567
No, sir, please wake up
sir, please wake up sir.

36:43.569 --> 36:46.736
Please wake up sir, oh God, sir!

36:46.738 --> 36:48.438
Okay, okay.

36:48.974 --> 36:49.974
Alright look.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.645
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.481
Please wake up, please wake up,
please wake up, please wake up.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.687
Oh God, no, no, no, no.

37:04.990 --> 37:08.325
Okay, okay, sir, please wake up.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.660
Please wake up, sir,
one, two, three, four,

37:10.662 --> 37:13.330
five, six, seven, eight.

37:25.310 --> 37:30.680
Please sir, please.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.018
Fuck!

37:40.792 --> 37:43.760
Some day all of this
will be yours.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.707
- Juanpa.
- What do you want?

37:57.976 --> 37:59.542
It's getting to the best part,

37:59.544 --> 38:01.645
she's putting the tongue,
oh, look at it, oh yeah.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.514
Damn it, Log,
what do you want bro?

38:05.617 --> 38:06.549
Can get that crow
bar back?

38:06.551 --> 38:08.051
Juanpa, we need to talk.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.321
Now. Now!

38:12.824 --> 38:13.857
Oh shit.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.395
You taking a selfie?

38:18.397 --> 38:21.064
Yeah it's lit. Argh!

38:21.433 --> 38:22.832
Should we try CPR?

38:23.302 --> 38:24.734
No man, I already tried that.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.037
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:27.039 --> 38:28.838
So this means
you made out with a guy?

38:29.508 --> 38:31.808
- Juanpa, this is not the time.
- Was it nice? Um...

38:31.810 --> 38:32.942
- What?
- It must be nice.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.478
- Dude, focus please.
- Yeah.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.500
They're actually dead, bro.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.721
Aw, nah, nah, nah.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.692
What, what should we do?

38:48.694 --> 38:51.061
I don't know.
Maybe someone else has a plan.

38:51.596 --> 38:54.597
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
that's a great idea, Log,

38:54.599 --> 38:56.099
who should we get,
oh Brittany Furlan?

38:56.101 --> 38:58.601
Who wants a body shot?

38:59.404 --> 39:01.571
Or the guy who makes me
doubt my sexuality, huh?

39:03.408 --> 39:05.008
Maybe King Bach,
he's your buddy right?

39:05.010 --> 39:07.043
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

39:07.045 --> 39:08.478
Think straight.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.646
You're right,
everyone will panic.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.614
I need you to figure
this out, okay?

39:11.616 --> 39:15.485
I need to put my seed into
a woman's vagina before I die.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.354
Okay, you go do that,
you go do that,

39:17.356 --> 39:19.122
because I'm probably
gonna crash this plane.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.825
- Alright, one of us has to succeed, okay?
- Yeah.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.993
- Yeah. Okay.
- One of us will.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.528
- One of us.
- Yeah.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.530
Probably you.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.740
<i>♪ Don't that feel
Real funky ya'll ♪</i>

39:44.383 --> 39:47.951
Brittany, I want
to take a body shot.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.052
Okay, come here, bitch.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.624
Jenna?

39:54.826 --> 39:58.428
Hey, Jenna?

39:58.430 --> 40:00.563
- Hey.
- Oh, hey stranger, where you been?

40:00.899 --> 40:03.833
Um... Can we talk for a second?

40:06.638 --> 40:09.773
Are you seriously asking
if you can say something to me?

40:09.775 --> 40:11.841
You're talking to me
while you're saying this.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.010
So, so can we or...

40:16.581 --> 40:18.882
Amber alert,
we've got a missing person

40:18.884 --> 40:21.918
aisle in seat 2E, suspect,
looks like he's been crying.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.720
I'm not crying.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.027
Vitaly killed them and both
of the pilots are already dead

40:31.029 --> 40:32.762
and I'm really scared right now,

40:32.764 --> 40:34.497
'cause no one is flying
this plane right now Jenna

40:34.499 --> 40:35.765
and I'm really scared and you're

40:35.767 --> 40:37.167
the only person
I can trust to help.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.169
Okay that's adorable
and a really good story

40:39.171 --> 40:41.171
but we land in a few hours.
I'm gonna try to sleep - No, no.

40:41.173 --> 40:42.806
- ...and you're gonna try to get your shit together.
- No, no, no.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.007
Please, please, please, Jenna

40:44.009 --> 40:45.842
please just follow me, okay?

40:47.646 --> 40:48.711
You need to see this.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.080
These pilots better be dead.

40:55.120 --> 40:59.923
- Oh shit. I jinxed it.
- Yeah, I know right, what are the odds?

40:59.925 --> 41:02.792
Hey, you wouldn't by chance know
how to drive a 767, would ya?

41:04.863 --> 41:06.729
We're all gonna die!

41:06.731 --> 41:07.997
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.233
Calm down, calm down.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.902
Do you know how to drive a 767?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.938
You unlucky bastard!

41:14.940 --> 41:16.773
Okay.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.775
Okay, breath Jenna
breath, breath, breath.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.210
Okay, Namaste, Namaste.

41:20.212 --> 41:22.245
Namaste, yeah, yeah,
that's right, that's good.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.847
Okay, okay.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.181
There's a murderer on this plane

41:25.183 --> 41:26.816
and I'm gonna have
to die with this loser

41:26.818 --> 41:29.185
and all his loser friends
but that's fine.

41:29.187 --> 41:32.021
I know my god it's not fine,
I'm not even having a good hair day.

41:32.257 --> 41:34.891
What about my open casket,
this plane will probably fuck my face up.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.960
- Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, Jenna!
- I need my face, what!

41:36.962 --> 41:38.628
We need to figure this out.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.997
Now, for the last time,

41:40.999 --> 41:43.900
do you know how to drive a 767?

41:45.036 --> 41:49.939
- No, I don't know how to fly a 767.
- Come on.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.808
So I'm just gonna
go back to my seat

41:51.810 --> 41:54.143
and look at pictures
of my dog until we crash.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.846
Until
we crash, we crash, we crash...

41:56.848 --> 42:00.550
Hey buddy. I heard you took
quite the little crash.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.619
Okay, let see what
the problem is.

42:05.123 --> 42:07.624
You puked on my bones!

42:07.626 --> 42:11.528
I'm so sorry, I don't
know what came over me.

42:11.963 --> 42:12.996
Ew.

42:14.699 --> 42:15.699
Are you okay?

42:21.006 --> 42:21.938
What was that?

42:21.940 --> 42:24.841
The flight attendants,
they'll know what to do.

42:25.710 --> 42:26.710
Did you just fart?

42:27.679 --> 42:29.145
But where did they go?

42:29.881 --> 42:30.914
We got to find them.

42:38.023 --> 42:39.088
Surprise.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.564
What the hell is wrong with you?

42:47.566 --> 42:49.699
What's wrong,
you don't like pranks?

42:49.701 --> 42:52.001
We don't like what,
I couldn't understand you, what?

42:52.237 --> 42:53.937
Amber alert, somebody's missing

42:53.939 --> 42:55.805
a sense of humor
down in the luggage.

42:55.807 --> 42:57.340
Amber Alert was my drag name.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.176
Okay.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.712
The flight attendants
are nowhere to be found

43:02.714 --> 43:05.432
- but I'm sure everything's gonna be fine, right?
- How is it gonna be fine, Logan?

43:05.433 --> 43:08.151
I don't know but they probably
figured out how to save the day.

43:08.153 --> 43:09.919
We're in an emergency
right now, you can't,

43:09.921 --> 43:11.788
you can't just sit there.
We need to do something.

43:11.790 --> 43:13.756
Press this button and
the flight attendants will come.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.825
Don't press the button,
that's not for emergencies,

43:15.827 --> 43:17.267
- that's for fucking water.
- Please.

43:17.729 --> 43:20.029
Wow, okay, at least have
the balls to do something.

43:22.067 --> 43:26.202
Oh my god, I just
hit the jackpot.

43:27.606 --> 43:28.805
How is this all free?

43:28.807 --> 43:30.139
You're a mother.

43:30.141 --> 43:31.908
- Oh, fuck.
- Give me these.

43:31.910 --> 43:34.110
- Jesus.
- Damn, you have a baby.

43:34.913 --> 43:37.380
You're supposed to have
seven of those but, you know.

43:37.382 --> 43:39.282
Taking care of business.

43:39.985 --> 43:42.885
<i>You can do it,
Logan, you can do it.</i>

43:42.887 --> 43:45.154
<i>If you won't do
it for her, do it for my virginity.</i>

43:45.156 --> 43:48.691
<i>Use your wings
you big pussy, pussy...</i>

43:49.861 --> 43:50.927
What are you doing here?

43:50.929 --> 43:52.161
I'm gonna drive this plane.

44:00.038 --> 44:02.205
Whoa, whoa, whoa, do you
even know what you're doing?

44:02.207 --> 44:04.073
No, but I'm a fast learner.

44:09.347 --> 44:11.681
Great, well, I hope
that wasn't important.

44:12.317 --> 44:16.019
Hey, hey check it out I think
I've figured out the radio.

44:16.221 --> 44:18.321
<i>Air traffic
control to flight 1524?</i>

44:18.323 --> 44:20.323
Air traffic control
to flight 1524?

44:20.325 --> 44:22.358
Oh my god you're there, hello.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.960
Aye, Benji here.

44:23.962 --> 44:25.862
Been trying to talk
to you guys for ages.

44:25.864 --> 44:27.296
Yeah Benji, we're here man.

44:27.298 --> 44:28.931
I take it
you're not the pilots?

44:28.933 --> 44:31.000
Uh, no, no,
my name is Logan Paul.

44:31.202 --> 44:32.735
You're not a terrorist,
are you mate?

44:32.737 --> 44:36.305
No, I'm
a social media sensation.

44:37.842 --> 44:40.043
We're a bit full
of ourselves, aren't we, mate?

44:40.345 --> 44:42.679
Why don't you stroke
the tip a bit more?

44:43.348 --> 44:45.248
- What?
- What happened to the pilots, mate?

44:45.817 --> 44:47.450
- They're dead.
- No worries, mate.

44:47.452 --> 44:50.253
- What happened to the flight attendants?
- They're missing.

44:50.255 --> 44:54.290
-<i> Slight worry but don't worry, we'll take care of ya.</i>
- Really?

44:54.292 --> 44:57.727
Amber Alert, missing flight
attendants of flight 1524.

44:59.297 --> 45:00.997
What was that? Aussie joke mate,

45:00.999 --> 45:03.066
you wouldn't get
the reference. Okay.

45:03.068 --> 45:05.435
It appears you guys
are a bit off course

45:05.437 --> 45:07.770
so I'm gonna punch in
some new coordinates,

45:08.073 --> 45:10.139
all you have to do
is engage the auto pilot

45:10.141 --> 45:12.709
and the plane will
literally land itself.

45:12.711 --> 45:15.144
Oh. That's great news, yeah.

45:15.146 --> 45:16.713
<i>You'll be a bloody hero, mate.</i>

45:16.715 --> 45:19.849
Yeah, yeah!

45:19.851 --> 45:21.484
Now you've got to raise
the auto pilot lever

45:21.486 --> 45:22.719
and engage the system.

45:22.721 --> 45:24.153
Okay, what does it look like?

45:24.155 --> 45:26.255
Big orange stick mate,
can't miss it.

45:29.894 --> 45:33.062
Um, can you be a little
more specific?

45:33.064 --> 45:36.799
It literally says autopilot
right on the thing there, mate.

45:37.736 --> 45:38.736
Um.

45:39.971 --> 45:41.237
Is that all it says?

45:42.807 --> 45:45.208
Big orange lever,

45:45.210 --> 45:48.244
center console, are you
bloody color blind?

45:48.246 --> 45:51.748
<i>It's the only thing
between you and certain death.</i>

45:53.918 --> 45:54.917
I broke it.

45:54.919 --> 45:59.422
- I'm sorry what?
- I broke off the autopilot by accident.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.363
Sir?

46:07.766 --> 46:08.431
Sir, you there?

46:11.169 --> 46:15.938
Crikey. It would appear there
are now a few more worries

46:15.940 --> 46:18.541
than my original estimate
of no worries.

46:19.978 --> 46:22.211
- How bad is it?
- You're fucked, mate.

46:22.881 --> 46:24.847
Oh my god.

46:25.416 --> 46:26.816
Oh my god.

46:26.818 --> 46:28.017
What do you mean I'm fucked?

46:28.019 --> 46:29.085
That's a great question.

46:29.320 --> 46:33.055
Well, you're
all types of fucked!

46:33.057 --> 46:36.159
You're totally fucked,
you're completely fucked.

46:36.161 --> 46:38.127
You're like a parrot
getting raped.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.863
- <i>You're fucked, I'm fucked.</i>
- Yeah.

46:40.865 --> 46:42.832
You're a little boy
in a windowless van,

46:42.834 --> 46:44.333
you're fucked
and you're gonna die.

46:44.836 --> 46:47.003
<i>Speaking of which I don't
like talking to dead people,</i>

46:47.005 --> 46:49.806
it really bums me out
so I'm gonna cut out early

46:49.808 --> 46:52.875
for lunch if no one minds
and, uh, grab a quick bite.

46:52.877 --> 46:54.076
Right, feeling a bit peckish.

46:54.078 --> 46:56.312
I mind, I definitely do mind.

46:56.314 --> 46:59.048
Well, too bad you're going
to be dead soon, Benji out.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.818
Alright, who wants tacos?

47:04.255 --> 47:06.823
- What a dick.
- How could you break the autopilot?

47:06.825 --> 47:08.157
It's not like
I did it on purpose.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.526
Oh, oh you didn't
do it on purpose?

47:10.528 --> 47:12.428
Well, that's great,
everything's just fine then,

47:12.430 --> 47:14.897
right, 'cause Logan
didn't do it on purpose.

47:14.899 --> 47:16.532
Give me this stupid thing.

47:17.268 --> 47:21.571
No, no, no. Um, pay, pay no mind
to the sound of struggle.

47:22.574 --> 47:24.540
<i>We are fine and smooth as silk.</i>

47:24.542 --> 47:26.823
- <i>Logan, they need to know.
- Jenna, no they don't.</i>

47:27.045 --> 47:29.245
I know you're probably terrified
right now and I am too,

47:29.948 --> 47:32.048
but what you're doing
is not helping.

47:33.051 --> 47:37.353
So just give me
the intercom, just hey.

47:37.989 --> 47:41.157
<i>Aw fuck, hey guys
if you look to your right</i>

47:41.159 --> 47:43.159
<i>and also to your left
you will notice</i>

47:43.161 --> 47:45.261
<i>the vast expanse of
the Pacific Ocean.</i>

47:45.263 --> 47:49.198
Oh, the ocean
that's so romantic.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.500
Okay, take
your fucking shot, Juanpa.

47:52.904 --> 47:55.338
Woohoo!

47:55.340 --> 47:57.073
We have to do something.

47:57.075 --> 48:00.109
Yeah, yeah I mean
it can be that hard, right?

48:01.646 --> 48:03.012
We'll first we can move
these bodies I mean

48:03.014 --> 48:04.294
they're really starting
to smell.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.949
Yeah. Up we go.

48:06.951 --> 48:08.551
Oh, I'm impressed.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.019
Yeah, moving corpses is easy.

48:11.656 --> 48:13.389
Oh no, just dry heaves.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.924
- Okay.
- I won't throw up.

48:17.962 --> 48:19.328
I'm sorry.

48:19.330 --> 48:20.330
Nice.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.237
Ew.

48:27.906 --> 48:29.472
Get the fuck out of my way.

48:30.141 --> 48:31.307
Have you seen my baby?

48:32.010 --> 48:33.010
No?

48:33.144 --> 48:34.477
Oh your breath stinks.

48:34.479 --> 48:35.912
Have you seen my baby?

48:37.181 --> 48:38.214
No.

48:38.216 --> 48:40.950
Oh sir, have you seen my baby?

48:41.953 --> 48:42.985
Your baby's missing?

48:42.987 --> 48:43.987
Yeah.

48:45.056 --> 48:48.157
I know your plight,
I'm a new mother myself.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.960
I'll help you find him,
what does he look like?

48:50.962 --> 48:54.096
Uh, he's a baby and he's white

48:54.365 --> 48:56.399
and he's got little arms.

48:57.201 --> 48:58.334
Is this your baby?

49:00.705 --> 49:01.705
Hey.

49:02.573 --> 49:03.573
Uh...

49:04.242 --> 49:05.374
I don't think so.

49:06.444 --> 49:08.144
I don't think so.

49:08.446 --> 49:11.480
Look lady, I'm not Dog
the fucking baby hunter.

49:11.482 --> 49:13.215
Okay, this baby that
I found simply doesn't have

49:13.217 --> 49:14.717
the wherewithal to raise itself

49:14.719 --> 49:16.152
and that's where I come in.

49:16.387 --> 49:17.987
That really looks...

49:17.989 --> 49:19.155
Why you touch baby?

49:19.424 --> 49:20.957
Who do you think you are?

49:20.959 --> 49:24.193
Walking around drunk around
this plane losing babies.

49:24.195 --> 49:26.395
You smell like
Jack Daniels's dick.

49:26.397 --> 49:28.130
I'm so sorry.

49:28.132 --> 49:31.167
You get the fuck out of our face
and you leave us alone.

49:32.236 --> 49:34.403
Why do men hate me so much?

49:34.405 --> 49:36.472
Because it's so easy.

49:37.709 --> 49:40.343
Boo fucking hoo.

49:43.147 --> 49:46.248
Do you know what would
be a hilarious prank?

49:49.187 --> 49:52.388
If we poisoned every
passenger on this plane.

49:52.390 --> 49:56.726
- No, no.
- Tell me where the emergency oxygen supply is.

49:56.728 --> 49:57.660
Never.

49:57.662 --> 49:58.594
- Never?
- Never.

49:58.596 --> 49:59.662
- Never?
- Never.

50:02.166 --> 50:03.432
- Never?
- No.

50:03.434 --> 50:05.735
Tell me how I access the oxygen,

50:05.737 --> 50:08.270
or I'll feed this dog cat food.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.575
Never! God no!

50:14.278 --> 50:15.278
Whoa!

50:16.114 --> 50:18.547
The poor dog, no.

50:19.550 --> 50:20.416
Good doggy.

50:22.020 --> 50:24.587
That's not what he's
supposed to eat.

50:24.589 --> 50:26.722
It's in the safety
glass by the door.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.624
- Why did you tell him, bitch?
- It's by the door.

50:28.626 --> 50:31.560
- You're going to pay for that.
- Thank you, thank you.

50:32.163 --> 50:34.063
You're going
to pay for that.

50:38.236 --> 50:40.036
Oh God, no.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.206
One for me.

50:47.412 --> 50:48.811
One for you.

50:48.813 --> 50:50.513
What are you doing?

50:52.550 --> 50:55.451
By the way it was dog food
the whole time.

50:56.621 --> 50:59.822
What kind of a man feeds
a dog cat food?

51:01.659 --> 51:04.393
How sick do you think I am?

51:08.266 --> 51:09.732
It's just a prank.

51:11.069 --> 51:12.802
You're probably not gonna
believe me when I tell you this

51:12.804 --> 51:17.440
but you know most people
think I'm this huge slut.

51:19.377 --> 51:21.677
But I've actually never
even been with a man before.

51:21.679 --> 51:24.480
Really? Maybe I can
help you with that,

51:24.482 --> 51:26.582
I've got some experience
in that arena.

51:29.520 --> 51:30.719
Aren't you like 16?

51:30.721 --> 51:32.154
Seventeen.

51:32.356 --> 51:35.858
Oh sorry, 17, my god.
You're still illegal.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.460
Hey, so what,
we're all gonna die.

51:37.795 --> 51:40.663
- What?
- Okay, look my dick can't handle anymore.

51:40.665 --> 51:42.765
The pilots are dead
and Logan's flying the plane.

51:44.535 --> 51:48.137
- What?
- You're so cute, and funny, and Mexican.

51:53.211 --> 51:55.178
That's not funny,
I, I took a picture.

51:55.179 --> 51:57.357
- Who is flying the plane?
- Logan's flying the fucking plane, alright.

51:57.381 --> 51:59.615
Listen, we've got nothing
else left to lose.

52:00.251 --> 52:02.218
This is either the most
elaborate pick-up line

52:02.220 --> 52:04.320
I've ever heard or we are
really all gonna die.

52:04.322 --> 52:05.821
Either way you're fucked.

52:06.791 --> 52:07.656
Good point.

52:16.334 --> 52:17.600
Oh my god.

52:25.276 --> 52:27.743
Fuck is going on
back there? Shit.

52:28.346 --> 52:31.347
Son of a bitch.
Hey, how the fuck you sleeping through this?

52:31.349 --> 52:33.749
Wake your ass up. I'm sure
we about too down in this bitch.

52:33.751 --> 52:35.818
Wait, wait, I'm not on the pill.

52:36.721 --> 52:37.786
Neither am I, neither am I.

52:37.788 --> 52:39.455
<i>♪ Oh shit ♪</i>

52:39.457 --> 52:41.557
Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:41.559 --> 52:42.758
Yeah oh.

52:58.543 --> 53:00.376
Oh, shit!

53:16.694 --> 53:18.761
There's a solution
to any problem.

53:18.763 --> 53:21.430
A wise woman once said,
"Shake it off..."

53:25.536 --> 53:26.536
Simba!

53:31.676 --> 53:33.776
Give this video a thumbs up!

53:44.255 --> 53:46.922
Give me that selfie stick,
give me that selfie stick.

53:47.491 --> 53:48.791
This is what panicking
looks like.

54:00.338 --> 54:03.672
Yo, flight 1524 we are out here.

54:03.674 --> 54:06.709
Your boy came back
like a movie star.

54:06.711 --> 54:08.544
Follow me on Twitter at...

54:09.380 --> 54:11.247
Fuck you Vitaly!

54:14.352 --> 54:15.718
Brittany?

54:15.720 --> 54:17.620
Brittany, Brittany, wake up.

54:17.955 --> 54:19.388
Wake up, wake up.

54:20.925 --> 54:23.459
You're being selfish
I need this.

54:23.461 --> 54:24.660
I can tell you're breathing.

54:27.665 --> 54:28.764
Are you there?

54:28.766 --> 54:30.599
Leave Brittany alone.

54:38.676 --> 54:39.942
Hey guys, Nick Bateman here.

54:40.378 --> 54:41.610
Now, all my life

54:42.313 --> 54:44.480
people would tell me
I'm really good looking.

54:44.482 --> 54:47.683
That I turn straight guys gay,
lesbians straight.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.818
Gay guys, gayer.

54:49.820 --> 54:51.854
But you know what, there's more

54:51.856 --> 54:54.890
to me than just a pretty face.
I'm also a junior pilot.

54:56.794 --> 54:58.560
I don't know what's
going on back there

54:58.929 --> 55:02.331
but I'm either gonna
save the day or die trying.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.800
Fuck yeah man, fucking do it.

55:05.336 --> 55:07.336
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

55:07.338 --> 55:10.606
Yeah, let's do this,
let's do this!

55:21.052 --> 55:22.851
Hey you, Yakuza.

55:23.587 --> 55:25.454
Did you see anything, hum?

55:26.557 --> 55:27.557
Jackie Chan?

55:27.792 --> 55:29.925
Jackie, you, you see anything?

55:30.494 --> 55:31.860
No? Shh.

55:44.675 --> 55:47.876
<i>Hello everybody,
it's the homosexual flight helper.</i>

55:47.878 --> 55:50.679
<i>The cabin pressure
is still so low,</i>

55:50.681 --> 55:54.350
<i>please put you oxygen
masks back on. Thank you.</i>

56:07.498 --> 56:08.797
<i>Don't do it, Logan.</i>

56:08.799 --> 56:10.833
<i>Vitaly kazed the oxygen supply.</i>

56:11.435 --> 56:12.968
<i>Godspeed my little cream pie.</i>

56:13.504 --> 56:14.937
Jenna wait, don't put that on.

56:15.506 --> 56:16.438
Why?

56:16.440 --> 56:17.673
Something's wrong
with the oxygen.

56:18.909 --> 56:19.909
How do you know?

56:20.711 --> 56:21.711
I hear gay people.

56:24.982 --> 56:26.048
I have to go find him.

56:26.550 --> 56:29.451
Logan no. Please, don't.

56:32.056 --> 56:33.056
Damn it.

56:33.924 --> 56:35.090
Hey you.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.832
Argh.

56:46.670 --> 56:47.803
Ah, my dick.

57:07.992 --> 57:10.092
My asshole, my asshole!

57:10.928 --> 57:12.528
Argh!

57:12.530 --> 57:15.097
I think it turned inside out!
Oh my god.

57:21.038 --> 57:22.038
Nick!

57:26.844 --> 57:28.043
Ah, great.

57:35.686 --> 57:36.785
Not the vodka.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.587
Ow!

57:40.157 --> 57:42.124
Ow shit!

57:42.126 --> 57:44.593
Holy shit,
what the hell are you doing?

57:44.595 --> 57:45.994
Completing my master prank.

57:46.564 --> 57:50.098
There's no social media
convention with all of you dead,

57:50.100 --> 57:53.235
all of your followers
will be mine. Imagine the power.

57:59.910 --> 58:01.610
Wait, you've been pranked.

58:02.546 --> 58:04.947
- What are you talking about?
- It was just all a prank, bro.

58:05.683 --> 58:08.750
Look closely, all these
people are acting, see?

58:09.553 --> 58:10.619
Look at this guy.

58:12.156 --> 58:14.790
Hello, I'm okay.

58:15.192 --> 58:16.658
You have been pranked.

58:16.861 --> 58:19.628
- Nick?
- See? Even that girls in on it.

58:26.637 --> 58:27.903
Fuck you Vitaly!

58:34.645 --> 58:36.144
Oh shit, I have a boner.

58:36.146 --> 58:38.680
Argh! Wha... Wake up
you chiseled brute.

58:38.883 --> 58:40.582
Oh, we are so fucking mcfucked.

58:40.584 --> 58:42.284
This crazy Russian,
he's gonna crash the plane

58:42.286 --> 58:44.720
and he threw out all
the parachutes except one.

58:44.722 --> 58:45.722
Holy shit.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.156
Is that dog eating cat food?

58:50.861 --> 58:55.797
Logan, baby, it's dog
food in a cat food can.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.766
Oh thank God.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.737
With a hint of Nick Bateman.

59:01.739 --> 59:04.773
It's just a prank, bro,
but I can assure you

59:04.775 --> 59:07.242
your death will be very real.

59:07.745 --> 59:10.546
Thanks for covering
my tracks, Logan Paul.

59:11.615 --> 59:12.648
I owe you one.

59:12.650 --> 59:17.853
No, no, no, no, no,
not the button, no, no that...

59:28.132 --> 59:31.667
If I die I'm taking you
with me, you fuck.

59:34.939 --> 59:38.240
Oh God I'm only 23, sort of.

59:40.711 --> 59:41.843
I can't hold on anymore!

59:50.054 --> 59:53.121
Tell my boyfriend Steve
to hide all the pornography.

59:54.825 --> 59:57.926
Maverick, no, no, no!

59:58.762 --> 59:59.962
Maverick!

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:06.735
That's my bird!

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:15.744
Oh God, thank you,
thank you, we're all together.

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:19.181
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, hey.

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:21.149
<i>Save
the day cum sponge.</i>

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.921
Hey Bruce.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.470
Any final advice on
how to land this plane?

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:31.927
If you can get to the cockpit,
engage the autopilot.

01:00:31.929 --> 01:00:34.863
The plane will literally
land itself.

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:38.834
Okay. Erm...

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.342
Vitaly, where is Jenna?

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:07.195
Nice try, ha.

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:10.766
- Ah!
- Oh, shit, I am so sorry,

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:12.234
I thought I could
jump kick Vitaly

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.301
and save the day, it would
have been really cool.

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:15.137
Yeah, shut up and stop him!

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:18.708
Here.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:24.246
- I hope you die!
- Argh!

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.181
This is just a flesh wound,

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:29.351
have a safe flight, captain.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:31.453
- Oomph!
- Aww!

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:34.122
Oh shit.

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:50.189
You'll be missed.

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.307
Do you get it? The jet engine
turned him into mist.

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:54.811
Okay.

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:00.315
You got a plane to land.

01:02:01.452 --> 01:02:02.451
I got this.

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:08.123
- I don't got this.
- Oh no, you do got this.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:11.293
- I don't know if I got this.
- I mean if you don't got this, then who got this?

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:12.961
I guess I'm gonna
need to get this.

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:15.030
Oh this best going
to get got then.

01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:17.866
It will, it's best gone got and

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:23.004
Oh the goings good and I'm at

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:25.474
- You got to get it.
- I'm gonna get it.

01:02:25.476 --> 01:02:28.009
What the fuck are you
people talking about?

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:31.379
- Get out there, come on.
- I'm a get it.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:32.781
You're gonna get it.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.193
Okay.

01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:49.164
<i>You can
do it, Logan, you can do it.</i>

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:53.001
<i>You're not supposed
to look down, just do it.</i>

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:55.937
<i>It's gonna go on YouTube.</i>

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:58.273
<i>YouTube, YouTube...</i>

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.542
You two, you two, you two

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:02.344
need to land this fucking plane.

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.780
I did not get laid Logan!

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:11.453
- Jenna, do you have service yet?
- Er... Yeah. Yeah, yeah here.

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:13.555
Oh, well, this is great service.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:18.860
<i>Go on get the last
scoop out of the carton.</i>

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:21.863
<i>With the squatty potty you
get complete elimination.</i>

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:23.799
- Skip the ad.
- I can't, it won't let me.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:26.281
<i>Yes, it will give you the best
poop of your life, guaranteed.</i>

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.503
Argh! If I die
because of this shit!

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:31.039
<i>Umm. They're good at pooping.</i>

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:33.308
Hey guys, it Connor
and today I'm gonna

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.410
be teaching you
how to land a passenger jet.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:38.180
Flying is easy
and with the right education

01:03:38.182 --> 01:03:39.581
and guidelines almost anyone

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.149
can learn the secrets of flight.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.818
- Amazing. Ok.
- It's easy.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.186
All you have to do
is pay attention...

01:03:44.188 --> 01:03:46.087
Nobody will watch
your stupid videos.

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:47.189
Leave me alone, Becky.

01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:48.890
Fuck you, Becky!

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:50.826
I'm telling mom about
your abortion.

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:51.827
Fuck you.

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.962
<i>Cool, okay, here are the basics.</i>

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:56.031
This is the yoke, it's
like the steering wheel

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:57.399
but here's the thing
you need to know,

01:03:57.401 --> 01:03:58.867
the controls are inverted

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:01.036
so, up is down, and down is up.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:02.504
Oh.

01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:05.407
This knob controls
the flaps.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:07.375
The flaps give
the plane lift and drag.

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:10.011
When landing you want
the flaps fully extended.

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:12.414
Remember, were going
for maximum air resistance.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:14.883
- Turn the knob.
- Okay, okay.

01:04:17.154 --> 01:04:19.487
The most important part of
landing is of course the...

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.256
Connor, your sister said you're

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:22.891
looking at anime porn again.

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:24.626
- She's lying.
- That's gross.

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.962
- God damn it, Connor!
- Fuck you, Becky!

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:28.930
When you get your own house
you can masturbate then.

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:31.299
- Okay, let's just skip ahead here.
- Yeah, skip that.

01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:34.269
Once you've done that it's
time to engage the auto pilot,

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:37.939
the plane with literally land
itself, how cool is that?

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:41.577
It's okay.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:45.013
No, my phone.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.348
Okay.

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:48.216
Hey what's that? What is...?

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:53.521
<i>By the grace
of Steve Irwin</i>

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.624
<i>you're still
magically on course.</i>

01:04:55.626 --> 01:04:58.226
<i>- Way to go, mate.</i>
- Benji, is that you?

01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:01.029
Sure is, mate,
and by the look of it

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:02.898
you're still not out
of the woods yet.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.634
- What?
- You're still quite fucked.

01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:08.270
- How fucked?
- Mate, you're missing an engine, you're running out of fuel,

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.972
and you're dropping like
a dead albatross with diabetes.

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:13.108
Now normally I'd say
check the cross winds,

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:14.409
20 knots from the southeast

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.677
but I'd bet my last dollar I do

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:17.078
you don't understand
a word of that.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.047
Yeah no shit I don't, Benji.

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:21.416
Just try to land on the white
line, fly straight and pray

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:24.085
you don't explode
on contact. And Logan.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.454
- <i>What?</i>
- You owe me a dollar you do.

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:30.158
- I fucking hate you Benji!
- Hey lose the tude, mate.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.994
Benji, I swear to God
if I survive this I'm...

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:35.463
Oi, wait a second,
would you look at that?

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:37.198
That koala looks like
Hugh Jackman.

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:39.301
I got to go bag me that koala.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:41.236
Man the fort, Hansen.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.340
Fuck the baby, I don't
want to die.

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:06.962
Aw! What...

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:10.598
- What the fuck?
- Get this fucking monkey off me.

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:13.402
Don't touch her.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:35.290
Oh my god, Logan, Logan.

01:06:35.726 --> 01:06:37.492
- Logan, we landed.
- What?

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:40.095
- We landed.
- Oh shit, oh my god.

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:43.032
We did it.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:48.036
Oh, wait we're not stopping,
why aren't we stopping?

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:49.037
<i>All you have to do.</i>

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:50.071
Connor!

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:52.040
<i>Okay, once you've landed</i>

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:54.275
you're gonna want to hit
the breaks with both feet.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:56.611
Brakes.

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:06.388
Thanks for watching and
don't forget to subscribe.

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:16.798
Oh my god, you did it.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.703
No Jenna, we did it.

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:25.073
Please don't ruin the moment
with your cheesy bullshit.

01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:36.651
We should probably
get off this thing.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:38.219
Following a hijacking

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:41.489
and an engine failure
on board flight 1524

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:44.325
an incredible chain of events
has led to the rescue...

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:46.294
Fuck her right in the pussy.

01:07:48.498 --> 01:07:50.665
Awesome!

01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.307
Aye, mate.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:00.642
Benji?

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:02.410
You're actually alive.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.245
I owe you a dollar I do.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.613
Don't worry about that.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.782
Genuinely surprised
to see you alive.

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:10.452
Took a lot of guts
to do what you did today.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.126
Hey buddy.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.194
Hey man.

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:20.196
So?

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:25.700
- I failed, Log, I failed.
- Aw.

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:29.437
- Oh, come on.
- I guess blue balls is real.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.705
It hurts, it hurts man.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:33.174
No, eh, eh, don't say that man.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:35.542
- You're still alive.
- I guess.

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:39.881
Your foreign exchange brother
is still a virgin.

01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:43.852
No man, my brother
is still a virgin.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:48.890
Such a tender moment.

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:50.693
Hey.

01:08:51.228 --> 01:08:51.893
Hey.

01:08:58.268 --> 01:09:00.868
Eugene, is that really you?

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:03.705
It's been 70 years.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:07.408
The last orgasm I had
was in Normandy in your mouth.

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:10.310
Consider it VD day.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.551
Bombs away.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:20.589
Uh...

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:22.823
So Australia's pretty nice huh?

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:24.593
Yeah.

01:09:26.563 --> 01:09:27.563
Yeah.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:29.930
Er...

01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:32.567
- Does it like hurt? Aw.
- Ow, ow, no I'm fine.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.202
- Okay.
- I got a bandage.

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.705
- You did good driving that plane.
- Thanks.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.515
Couldn't have done it
without my co-pilot.

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:43.545
What did I tell you
about being cheesy?

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:46.514
- To not be cheesy.
- Yeah, definitely stop.

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:53.787
So I've looked everywhere
and I can't find him.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:55.524
Aw!

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:59.661
I think it safe to say
that your baby's gone.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.266
Have you considered
adoption maybe?

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:10.738
I mean no, I, I thought I'd find
him on the plane, you know?

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.641
Right. That's horrible.

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:15.877
Well, here's some good news.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:18.713
When that plane was going down

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.381
and I thought we were all dead,

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:24.819
I had one split second to
ejaculate into this Tupperware

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.422
so I could let my seed live on.

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.524
I made this out of my penis.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.860
Put it in your vagina,
make a new baby.

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:37.565
Oh my god,
this is the nicest thing

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.300
any man's ever done for me.

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:40.302
It's pretty great.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:43.871
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:45.432
But it still doesn't
bring my baby back.

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:47.308
What your old baby?

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.577
- Yeah.
- This is a brand new baby.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.513
You ungrateful bitch.

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:54.749
Give me my seed back
you don't deserve it.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:56.451
You do not deserve...

01:10:57.654 --> 01:11:01.856
No I'm sorry, spit it out, spit
it out put it back in my vagina.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.292
- Too late! It's too late!
- I'm sorry!

01:11:04.294 --> 01:11:05.727
You've wasted my seed!

01:11:05.729 --> 01:11:10.398
No, I'm sorry, put it back
in my vagina please.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.666
Please, please.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:17.939
It's going back into my penis,
I can feel it.

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:21.276
I have nothing else to live for.

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:23.411
I'm getting hard!

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:25.647
I guess this is goodbye.

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:28.616
Yup, I hope everything works
out with your girlfriend.

01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:30.686
That was really brave.

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:33.021
- Come here.
- Bye.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.857
Thank you so much,
I woke up on the toilet.

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:36.758
Jenna wait.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.992
Thank you so much.

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:40.762
I don't even know you people.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:42.397
- I'm your brother.
- I know you.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.441
Okay, here we go.

01:11:58.615 --> 01:11:59.615
You're excited?

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.685
- Yeah.
- This is it, right?

01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:04.752
This is it. This is it.

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:10.425
Are you sure about this?

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:14.595
I've never been so sure
about anything in my life.

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:17.866
Logan!

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:20.535
Eh, yeah, it's me.

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:22.070
Er, I'm Logan.

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:25.373
Wait, you're not Logan.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:28.643
- You sound different.
- Yeah.

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:32.714
I'm his foreign
exchange brother Juanpa.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:34.882
- Mexico.
- So?

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:37.085
And I have an accent.

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:46.060
What? No, no, I can't
understand you though.

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.628
Can you say that again?

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.665
One more time, just,
just say it one more time.

01:12:54.003 --> 01:12:57.638
Okay, okay, don't say
anything cheesy.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:02.076
Jenna? It took me traveling half
way around the world to realize

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:04.512
- that I love you.
- I'm sorry your accent is just gnarly,

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:05.980
can you please just
repeat yourself?

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:08.383
Okay, uh, I guess you worked out

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:09.625
everything with your boyfriend.

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:12.854
Oh, yeah, the guac is extra,

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:14.589
I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:18.059
<i>Who was
that guy, he's fucking hot.</i>

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:24.165
You're gay,

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.634
Oh my god, so are you.

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:29.137
- No, no, I'm, I'm here for her, so.
- Logan?

01:13:29.139 --> 01:13:31.572
But, but, but just one kiss,
that's all I ask.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.075
Okay, fine,
but then you have to leave.

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:37.779
Now get out.

01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:39.480
Wait, how did you
hear my thoughts?

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:48.990
Whoa yeah, I guess I always
thought you were a little bit...

01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:03.471

01:14:20.657 --> 01:14:22.123

What the fuck?

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:08.069
