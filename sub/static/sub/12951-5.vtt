00:03.069 --> 00:05.537
CIA profile:
Agent Sydney Bristow.

00:05.538 --> 00:06.438
Okay. I'm in.

00:06.439 --> 00:09.374
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.243
Also a double agent with CIA.

00:11.244 --> 00:12.678
Get down!

00:12.679 --> 00:14.813
I guess we'll have to learn
to trust each other.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.314
Bristow's CIA contact:
Michael Vaughn.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.151
My guardian angel.

00:19.152 --> 00:23.748
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.621
A secret organization
dealing in espionage,

00:26.693 --> 00:29.719
extortion, weapons sales,
posing as the CIA.

00:29.796 --> 00:32.662
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.666
SD-6 director: Arvin Sloane.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.397
The sanctity of this agency
requires the sacrifice

00:37.470 --> 00:38.904
of some personal freedoms.

00:38.905 --> 00:41.405
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

00:41.474 --> 00:43.308
This is about killing
the monster.

00:43.309 --> 00:46.540
Bristow's mother,
formerly Russian intelligence,

00:46.613 --> 00:49.207
recently turned herself in
to the CIA.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.983
Mom?

00:50.984 --> 00:52.384
Intel indicates

00:52.385 --> 00:55.218
she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.256
The true loyalty
of Agent Bristow's mother

00:59.325 --> 01:01.326
remains unknown.

01:01.327 --> 01:03.326
Previously on "Alias"...

01:03.327 --> 01:05.856
I want to make something
very clear to you.

01:06.327 --> 01:11.856
And if Sydney, in any way, becomes victim
to your endgame, I will kill you

01:18.327 --> 01:22.856
You haven't told her what you did to her
after I disappeared... have you?

01:24.327 --> 01:28.856
There are no explosives or anti-intrusion
systems. She says the building is clean.

01:28.891 --> 01:30.855
We can't trust
this information

01:30.856 --> 01:32.855
Unless she wants
to prove herself.

01:32.856 --> 01:35.055
That's the kind of hopeful thinking
that will get you killed.

01:35.056 --> 01:38.456
We're sending you to Madagascar
to retrieve the bible.

01:38.491 --> 01:40.956
You, too. Prepare to leave tonight
Let's move it.

01:44.456 --> 01:48.456
Jack, I owe you.
But why 30 pounds of Semtex?

01:49.456 --> 01:52.456
I need you to make sure that if anyone
enters that building, no one will survive.

01:59.456 --> 02:01.455
The building is wired to explode

02:01.456 --> 02:04.456
Sydney, look under the house.
Is there a crawl space?

02:09.455 --> 02:11.956
She lied to me.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074

03:10.200 --> 03:11.199
Five weeks ago,

03:11.200 --> 03:14.000
Irina Derevko surrendered herself
to the CIA.

03:14.035 --> 03:16.299
She claimed that she wanted to cooperate

03:16.300 --> 03:20.900
to seek restitution for the crimes
she committed against the United States.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.499
During the next several weeks,

03:22.500 --> 03:26.600
Irina Derevko provided meaningful
intelligence to the CIA

03:26.635 --> 03:28.199
on several occasions...

03:28.200 --> 03:30.099
Pardon the interruption, Agent Bristow.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.900
Let's talk about last week,

03:32.935 --> 03:35.665
the incident in Madagascar.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.465
Before Derevko turned herself in
to the CIA,

03:38.500 --> 03:43.100
as leverage, she concealed her
organization's operations manual.

03:43.135 --> 03:46.765
Last week the CIA discovered
where it was hidden.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.200
When I told Derevko I was going in
to retrieve the manual,

03:50.235 --> 03:53.600
she informed us that the building
was safe to enter.

03:53.635 --> 03:55.599
In truth, it was a trap.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.265
Derevko had rigged it with explosives.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.599
Just as we were about to enter the building,

04:00.600 --> 04:03.500
an agent spotted something on
the satellite imagery.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.399
That agent was your father.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.699
Yes.

04:07.700 --> 04:13.700
He saved my life.

04:37.600 --> 04:42.750
I wanted to stand in this cell, just once.

04:42.785 --> 04:47.392
You tried to warn me about her
so many times.

04:47.427 --> 04:51.965
I'm so sorry that I didn't listen to you.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.765
Some things you need to
experience for yourself.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.800
I imagine every parent tries to protect
their children from that truth.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.750
I never said thank you

05:07.785 --> 05:10.965
for saving my life.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
We're due for a briefing at SD-6.
We should go.

05:34.600 --> 05:40.600
Vienna

06:37.300 --> 06:38.099
Niels Hater.

06:38.100 --> 06:42.000
The so-called Austrian connection
was murdered yesterday morning in Vienna.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.299
The bold nature of the hit,

06:43.300 --> 06:45.499
the complete disregard for civilian
collateral damage,

06:45.500 --> 06:47.499
indicates the work of the triad.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.600
Hater was triad.
They killed one of their own?

06:50.635 --> 06:52.199
Yes, we believe so.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.799
The triad? You never mentioned them before.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.899
It's a loose coalition
of organized crime entities.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.799
They deal in mainly drugs and prostitution,

06:57.800 --> 07:01.200
but over the past couple of years they've
made a significant foray into weapons.

07:01.235 --> 07:03.499
Okay. So why did they kill Hater?

07:03.500 --> 07:06.365
Because he was selling intel to SD-6.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.799
In his last communiqué to our source in Vienna,

07:08.800 --> 07:14.800
Hater informed us that the triad was engaged
in a plot to deploy and develop sixteen
Next Generation weapons.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.399
Any idea what Next Generation refers to?

07:17.400 --> 07:20.500
No, which is a major source for concern.

07:20.535 --> 07:21.699
According to the communiqué,

07:21.700 --> 07:24.665
testing of the weapons is ahead of schedule

07:24.700 --> 07:27.500
which means they may soon be put into the field.

07:27.535 --> 07:29.499
Do we know where these weapons are now?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.699
Budapest.

07:30.700 --> 07:35.300
During the Cold War, the Russians built a massive
bomb shelter under the magistrate's bureau.

07:35.335 --> 07:41.300
The triad has been using that shelter
as a testing facility.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.699
Your mission is to gain access
to that facility,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.399
identify the nature of the weapons,

07:49.400 --> 07:52.750
retrieve the specs and test data
off the central server

07:52.785 --> 07:56.100
and then proceed to the R&D lab
and photograph the weapons.

07:56.135 --> 07:58.600
So that SD-6 can engineer
the weapons for themselves.

07:58.635 --> 08:00.199
Which we won't let happen.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.800
Okay. I'll confer with your father
about your countermission.

08:03.835 --> 08:07.365
My father?

08:07.400 --> 08:09.865
He didn't tell you?

08:09.900 --> 08:13.100
Based on your father's instincts
in the Madagascar incident,

08:13.135 --> 08:17.500
Devlin gave him operational approval.

08:17.535 --> 08:23.500
Oh.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.899
When you and I were approaching that building,

08:27.900 --> 08:31.265
ops was monitoring our process
via sat radar scan.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.600
Now, at the last moment, your father
switched to infrared

08:34.635 --> 08:36.899
which is how he saw the explosives.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.900
We don't have routine satellite coverage
over Madagascar,

08:39.934 --> 08:42.099
one had to be retasked.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.198
Now the closest one was over the Indian Ocean,

08:44.200 --> 08:48.700
yet your father specifically requested
the one over the South Atlantic.

08:48.735 --> 08:49.899
Which, of the two,

08:49.900 --> 08:52.800
is the only one that has infrared capabilities.

08:52.835 --> 08:55.700
He wanted to account for every possibility.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.965
Probably.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
Or it's possible that he already knew
there'd be explosives at that entrance.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.899
I don't see how,

09:07.900 --> 09:13.900
he never trusted my mother's motives but he...

09:15.800 --> 09:20.500
You think my father wired that entrance...

09:20.535 --> 09:26.500
to set up my mother.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.699
We were nearly killed!

09:28.700 --> 09:29.299
I know.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.499
If there had been interference on our comms...

09:30.500 --> 09:32.499
You have to admit it wouldn't be the first time.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.299
Meaning what?!

09:33.300 --> 09:33.999
Rusik.

09:34.000 --> 09:34.499
Rusik!

09:34.500 --> 09:35.599
Your father set up Rusik!

09:35.600 --> 09:37.499
I was a prisoner!
Sloane was about to have me executed!

09:37.500 --> 09:39.799
I don't see why you're denying
this possibility!

09:39.800 --> 09:43.100
I understand that your authority
has been superseded by my father

09:43.135 --> 09:45.900
and maybe you feel irrelevant.

09:45.935 --> 09:48.700
But he saved our lives.

09:48.735 --> 09:54.700
Remember that!

09:56.400 --> 10:02.400
I won't wait to hear from you.

10:28.900 --> 10:29.699
Hey!

10:29.700 --> 10:30.799
Hey.

10:30.800 --> 10:31.799
Hi, you look fabulous!

10:31.800 --> 10:33.699
Oh, so do you.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.099
I am... I am so proud of you.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.299
Thank you.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.399
Where did you get all these people?

10:37.400 --> 10:39.099
Can you believe it? I invited a hundred people,

10:39.100 --> 10:41.099
thinking maybe seventy would show up.

10:41.100 --> 10:41.799
You said you were worried.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.499
He tells his NA meeting.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.099
And they're good people.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.100
I'm sure they're fantastic people but
we make ninety per cent of our profits

10:47.135 --> 10:53.100
from the bar and they don't drink.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.565
Hi.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.099
The plane leaves for Budapest in an hour.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.599
You'll meet Dixon at the airport.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.299
When you get into the triad's test facility,

11:46.300 --> 11:48.499
you'll log onto their computer.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.400
Sloane expects you to disable the firewall
so that SD-6 can hack in

11:52.435 --> 11:55.365
and directly download the specs
for the Next Gen weapons.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.900
Once you've accessed the computer you'll
contact the CIA and give us the IP address.

11:59.935 --> 12:02.299
We'll download the specs.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.599
Here, memorize this number.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.699
This is the IP address you'll give Dixon.

12:06.700 --> 12:10.800
He'll think he's accessing the triad's
computer but he'll be on a CIA server.

12:10.835 --> 12:12.999
We've set up some dummy files for him
to download.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.465
Anything else?

12:17.500 --> 12:21.850
Sydney, Washington has made a decision
regarding your mother.

12:21.885 --> 12:26.200
What she did to you
invalidated her agreement with the CIA.

12:26.235 --> 12:30.165
The government is pressing charges.

12:30.200 --> 12:36.200
They're going to seek the death penalty.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.799
Hey, Daddy.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.399
Hey, Craig, what are you doing in LA?

12:48.400 --> 12:52.500
Madagascar customs picked up a US national
transporting explosives.

12:52.535 --> 12:55.200
They brought him to LA,
I'm babysitting him to New York.

12:55.235 --> 12:58.565
Listen, I heard about Weiss. How's he doing?

12:58.600 --> 13:00.599
It was... it was rough but they say
he's going to be okay.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.799
Which is more than I can say about
the nursing staff.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.600
Wait till he gets home,
he's going to be insufferable.

13:05.635 --> 13:06.499
Listen, I have to...

13:06.500 --> 13:08.099
Yeah, yeah, go, go.
I'll be back next month.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.699
I want to play some ball.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.299
Well, you think you're ready for this?

13:11.300 --> 13:17.300
That's cute, that's cute.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.899
Craig!

13:22.900 --> 13:24.799
The guy with the explosives,
was it semtex?

13:24.800 --> 13:25.399
Yeah.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.399
Vintage Russian stuff.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.599
Yeah, that's right. How'd you know that?

13:27.600 --> 13:28.999
And he's here in LA.

13:29.000 --> 13:29.899
Yeah, for the next two hours.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.400
I have to talk to him.

13:32.435 --> 13:38.400
He's with me.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.249
Manola de Souza, I'm Agent Vaughn.

13:53.284 --> 13:55.799
Has anyone offered you a drink?

13:55.800 --> 14:01.165
I'm sure I could find a soda.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.765
This is not a good time
to be a terrorist, Manola.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.500
A couple of years ago,
and you would have had some civil rights.

14:06.535 --> 14:08.099
Now we just throw you in a cell,

14:08.100 --> 14:12.500
no attorney, no due process.

14:12.535 --> 14:16.900
So who were you working for?

14:16.935 --> 14:18.399
Okay.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.965
In that case, we'll just let
the pictures tell the story.

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
Satellite photos from four days ago showing
You rigging a plantation building in the
jungle near Sambava.

14:28.900 --> 14:32.800
Those photos are all we need to
put you away for the rest of your life.

14:32.835 --> 14:35.300
So I'm going to ask you one more time:

14:35.335 --> 14:41.300
do you want that soda?

14:44.100 --> 14:48.300
I was working for you, you son of a bitch.

14:48.335 --> 14:54.300
CIA.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.999
Through what office?

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
My contact was Jack Bristow.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.199
You tell that bastard

15:08.200 --> 15:14.200
I'm not taking the fall on this.

15:17.100 --> 15:21.165
Budapest

15:21.200 --> 15:22.599
Testing 1-2-3...

15:22.600 --> 15:23.699
Good.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.700
Once you disable the network firewall
I'll download the database

15:26.900 --> 15:29.700
while you access the viewing room
and take photos of the weapons.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.799
The guards change shifts at noon.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.400
That gives you ten minutes to take place.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.517
How do I look?

15:37.552 --> 15:39.599
Lip gloss.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.299
What I have here is an ordinary tube
of lip gloss.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.599
Let's say you're at the beach and

15:42.600 --> 15:45.100
your lips are feeling a little...
"My lips are chapped!"

15:45.135 --> 15:46.999
...or you're possibly on a date,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.599
it's the end of the night and some smooching.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.465
You want your lips to be supple.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.400
Pistachio. That's my favorite flavor.

15:55.435 --> 15:59.065
But you flip it over

15:59.100 --> 16:02.100
and it's a miniature camera with
compressed air injector.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.699
Take a look and go ahead and smile 'cause

16:03.700 --> 16:09.700
you're on TV.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.199
Uh, and uh, anyway, this,

16:15.200 --> 16:17.099
there's three cameras inside the tube.

16:17.100 --> 16:21.400
I mean, I wanted to make four but then there
wouldn't be any room for the actual lip gloss.

16:21.435 --> 16:27.400
I'll make you a fresh one.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.999
So you're making a family tree?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.699
It's a present for my grandparents.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.750
They're both from Budapest but they lost
everything in the war.

16:41.785 --> 16:44.800
Well, I'm certain you'll find the
documentation of their marriage

16:44.835 --> 16:49.200
and you should be able to find
their registration of birth.

16:49.235 --> 16:53.667
Our records are very complete,
dating back to 1895.

16:53.702 --> 16:58.100
Older than that, unfortunately,
not so thorough.

17:00.800 --> 17:05.365
Good work, Syd.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.999
Birth records are here.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.200
Over there, documents of marriage
and death.

17:10.234 --> 17:13.000
The correlation is unintended.

17:13.035 --> 17:16.916
Please.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.675
8-2-4...

17:19.710 --> 17:22.398
One problem.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.799
All documents are in Hungarian.

17:23.800 --> 17:29.800
How do you expect to know
what they're saying?

17:30.300 --> 17:30.999
That's good.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
My grandparents taught me.

17:41.200 --> 17:47.200
All right, Syd, you're clear.

17:48.200 --> 17:54.200
Combination is 8-2-4-0-2.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.699
Stand by, Dixon, I'm going radio silent.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.565
Okay, Syd, stand by.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.399
Mountaineer, in position.
Come in, boot camp.

18:23.400 --> 18:29.400
Copy that, Mountaineer.

18:34.700 --> 18:40.700
Stand by for IP address, boot camp.

18:41.100 --> 18:47.100
Boot camp, IP address is 199.181.134.104.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.949
I have opened port 47.

18:49.984 --> 18:52.299
Good work, Mountaineer.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.699
Go ahead, give the dummy IP to Dixon.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.899
See you at home.

18:55.900 --> 19:01.165
Copy that.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.899
Dixon, I've disconnected the firewall.

19:02.900 --> 19:08.500
The IP address is 259.10.3.179.

19:08.535 --> 19:09.899
Good work, Syd.

19:09.900 --> 19:13.200
Now go get some pictures of the
weapons and we're out of here.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.500
The viewing room is around the corner,
to the left.

19:16.535 --> 19:19.200
The door is marked

19:19.235 --> 19:25.200
Copy that.

19:25.900 --> 19:31.900
You're clear to exit.

19:38.300 --> 19:44.300
Okay... go.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.799
Sydney, you've got company.

19:48.800 --> 19:54.800
Two guards coming on your left.

20:21.600 --> 20:27.600
Sixteen Next Generation weapons...

21:00.800 --> 21:05.300
We had no idea that the sixteen Next Generation
weapons would turn out to be children.

21:05.335 --> 21:06.999
They were being trained as sleeper agents?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.799
That appears to be the case.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.265
See, the best spies have certain traits...

21:11.300 --> 21:14.700
proficiency with numbers, three dimensional
thinking, creative problem solving...

21:14.735 --> 21:19.567
these abilities are all in evidence
as early as five years old.

21:19.602 --> 21:24.365
This is footage that we downloaded
from the triad computer.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.550
Every first grader in the European Union
takes a standardized test.

21:27.585 --> 21:30.700
A few years ago, the triad acquired
the company doing the testing

21:30.800 --> 21:33.800
to locate children with these traits.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.099
This year, twenty-eight children were indicated.

21:36.100 --> 21:40.700
Their parents were sent letters inviting them
to participate in a month-long achievement program.

21:40.735 --> 21:42.499
Sixteen accepted.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.965
Six-year-olds acquire knowledge
at an incredible rate,

21:45.000 --> 21:50.200
so the basic skills of marksmanship,
linguistics, visual, verbal cue recognition,

21:50.235 --> 21:53.100
it can all be taught in a matter of weeks.

21:53.135 --> 21:54.499
Who's he?

21:54.500 --> 21:56.399
We're still working on that.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.965
So what happens to these kids
at the end of the month?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Triad sends them home with the
intent that when they're grown

22:02.035 --> 22:05.000
they will contact these kids and
send them out to the field.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.200
There was a rumor that the KGB began
developing a similar program back in the '80s,

22:09.235 --> 22:11.765
but we never confirmed it.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.099
Before these kids are sent home,
their memories are reset?

22:14.100 --> 22:15.399
Yeah. That's right.

22:15.400 --> 22:21.400
They remember nothing except that
it was extremely satisfying.

22:37.400 --> 22:42.800
Someone forged my wife's name in the
registry at her favorite bed and breakfast...

22:42.835 --> 22:47.865
weeks after her death.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.200
My concern is that it's intended
to be a message.

22:51.235 --> 22:53.599
You have enemies, Arvin.

22:53.600 --> 22:59.300
Clearly, one of them is trying
to leverage your grief.

22:59.335 --> 23:02.717
It's not my grief.

23:02.752 --> 23:06.065
It's my guilt.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.965
Cancer didn't kill Emily, Jack.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
Emily's doctor told us
that her cancer was in remission.

23:15.600 --> 23:21.200
That very day the Alliance told me
that I was being considered for partner,

23:21.235 --> 23:23.665
but that there was a problem.

23:23.700 --> 23:27.865
Somehow, Emily had learned that...

23:27.900 --> 23:31.100
well, she learned about my association
with SD-6.

23:31.135 --> 23:33.667
She didn't know the truth,

23:33.702 --> 23:36.199
in fact, she assumed the lie.

23:36.200 --> 23:41.465
That we're a branch of the CIA.

23:41.500 --> 23:47.500
Despite that, the Alliance decided to make
my promotion contingent on Emily's death.

23:48.100 --> 23:51.465
My choice was an easy one.

23:51.500 --> 23:56.200
I wasn't about to kill my wife.

23:56.235 --> 24:00.900
Emily was not a bargaining chip.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.800
Then I talked to her doctor

24:05.835 --> 24:09.565
and I was persuaded that...

24:09.600 --> 24:11.499
despite the temporary remission,

24:11.500 --> 24:14.965
that Emily's lymphoma would return

24:15.000 --> 24:19.800
and that it would slowly and
painfully kill her.

24:19.835 --> 24:23.765
She had already suffered so much, Jack.

24:23.800 --> 24:28.700
The thought of her succumbing to this
merciless illness

24:28.735 --> 24:34.700
or being killed by the Alliance...

24:38.200 --> 24:44.200
So, I dissolved sodium morphate
in a glass of red wine.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.699
The wine put her to sleep,

24:47.700 --> 24:53.700
the sodium morphate then caused
a heart attack.

24:54.500 --> 25:00.265
She didn't suffer.

25:00.300 --> 25:06.300
I will find out who's doing this.

25:07.700 --> 25:13.700
Jack?

25:14.800 --> 25:18.300
See who else was being considered
for partnership.

25:18.335 --> 25:21.917
I was given a seat at that table.

25:21.952 --> 25:25.465
That means someone else was not.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.000
I have this new friend on my work detail,

25:28.035 --> 25:29.499
Tommy Marijuana.

25:29.500 --> 25:34.100
We call him that because there's Tommy Marijuana
and there's Tommy Crystal Meth.

25:34.135 --> 25:38.700
Tommy Marijuana thinks that we're always the
person that we were in the sixth grade.

25:38.735 --> 25:39.899
Sixth grade was an awkward phase for me.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.199
Oh, come on. You, awkward?

25:41.200 --> 25:43.865
Yeah. Big teeth and little eyes.

25:43.900 --> 25:46.800
And I always was a foot taller than
everyone else so I sort of hunched over.

25:46.835 --> 25:48.899
I wish I could have seen that.

25:48.900 --> 25:51.665
When I was in sixth grade, I was
sort of anonymous.

25:51.700 --> 25:55.000
You know, you had the smart kid, and the
funny kid, and the good athlete.

25:55.035 --> 26:01.000
And I was just Will.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.765
They're putting my mom on trial.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.599
They're going to ask for the death penalty.

26:14.634 --> 26:17.399
And the only way I'm able to deal with this

26:17.400 --> 26:23.400
is to tell myself that that woman
was never really my mother.

26:23.435 --> 26:27.865
The irony is since she's been back,

26:27.900 --> 26:33.900
my father and I are closer than
we've ever been.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.199
It's Vaughn.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.649
I have to go.

26:44.684 --> 26:48.099
Hey, Vaughn,

26:48.100 --> 26:49.699
the guy with the semtex... de Souza

26:49.700 --> 26:51.199
...are we supposed to be looking into that?

26:51.200 --> 26:51.599
Excuse me?

26:51.600 --> 26:54.500
I was just wondering, is that our case
or were you pursuing it independently?

26:54.535 --> 26:57.565
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.400
Daily situation report says the guy was
here on a transfer order.

27:00.435 --> 27:05.100
You're listed as visiting him.

27:05.135 --> 27:11.100
Vaughn?

27:15.200 --> 27:19.200
No, it's not our case.

27:19.235 --> 27:20.699
Hello, Sydney.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.899
Dad, hi.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.799
Agent Vaughn contacted you?

27:23.800 --> 27:25.499
Yeah.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.800
Have we identified the man from Budapest
with the children?

27:28.835 --> 27:30.699
Yes. Valerie Kholokov.

27:30.700 --> 27:31.699
It's Kholokov?

27:31.700 --> 27:32.399
You've heard of him?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.699
Yeah, he used to run KGB's psych ops division.

27:34.734 --> 27:36.999
Mind control experiments, psychoactive drugs.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.199
I thought he was dead.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.299
Well, so did we. But apparently,

27:39.300 --> 27:42.265
after the KGB dissolved he went over
to the triad.

27:42.300 --> 27:46.100
A facial recognition scanner at the airport
in Buenos Aires identified him yesterday.

27:46.135 --> 27:47.399
What's he doing in Buenos Aires?

27:47.400 --> 27:48.399
He has a house there.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.199
The project in Budapest is complete.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.465
A team is raiding that facility as we speak.

27:53.500 --> 27:57.000
The children have all returned home and we
have surveillance teams monitoring each of them.

27:57.035 --> 27:59.465
If the triad ever makes contact,
we'll intercede.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.500
We'll need to grab Kholokov, see how many
other kids he's done this to.

28:02.535 --> 28:03.999
Who they are, where they are.

28:04.000 --> 28:04.799
There's a team prepping now.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.299
Good. I want to go with them.

28:06.300 --> 28:09.665
No. Sending you to Buenos Aires would be
an unnecessary risk.

28:09.700 --> 28:13.800
Kholokov has a private security detail,
external and internal alarm systems...

28:13.835 --> 28:17.700
Dad, when I signed up with SD-6,
I wanted to join.

28:17.735 --> 28:20.500
When I found out the truth,

28:20.535 --> 28:25.265
I mean... these kids...

28:25.300 --> 28:27.699
I know what it's like to be used.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.750
I'm going to Buenos Aires.

28:30.785 --> 28:33.800
Team leaves in twelve hours.

28:33.835 --> 28:37.800
Okay. Anything else?

28:37.835 --> 28:40.465
That's all.

28:40.500 --> 28:46.500
I'm going to pack.

28:49.900 --> 28:52.465
I saw de Souza.

28:52.500 --> 28:57.300
He told me that you hired him
to rig those explosives.

28:57.335 --> 29:02.100
Irina Derevko would eagerly
destroy all of our lives.

29:02.135 --> 29:03.299
I'm not a big fan, either.

29:03.300 --> 29:07.600
It still doesn't justify what you did.

29:07.635 --> 29:09.717
You do good work, Agent Vaughn.

29:09.752 --> 29:11.799
But your consistent shortcoming

29:11.800 --> 29:13.299
...you should know this

29:13.300 --> 29:16.965
...is your naive sense of morality.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.300
Evil must be eliminated
by whatever means necessary.

29:21.335 --> 29:22.899
I don't think Sydney would agree with that.

29:22.900 --> 29:27.500
Sydney will never know about what I've done.

29:27.535 --> 29:29.899
You betrayed her trust.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.799
I won't.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.199
Now, she should hear it from you,

29:33.200 --> 29:34.599
but if you don't tell her,

29:34.600 --> 29:40.600
I promise you, I will.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.099
Yes, sir?

30:23.100 --> 30:25.199
Why is my security system disabled?

30:25.200 --> 30:28.800
It was disengaged on site, sir, ten minutes ago.

30:28.835 --> 30:32.700
I'll put the system back online, sir.

30:32.735 --> 30:34.199
Sir?

30:34.200 --> 30:40.200
Is everything okay?

30:42.900 --> 30:48.900
Buenos Aires

30:53.500 --> 30:55.099
I'm going in.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.399
The guard's been sedated.

30:56.400 --> 31:02.400
Copy that, Mountaineer.

32:12.700 --> 32:16.000
I make four guards in the courtyard,

32:16.035 --> 32:18.299
Kholokov just went inside.

32:18.300 --> 32:24.300
Get into position, I'm heading to
the juncture box.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.600
You take the guards, I got Kholokov.

32:33.635 --> 32:36.765
On my signal,

32:36.800 --> 32:40.500
and that's in 3... 2... 1.

32:40.535 --> 32:46.500
Go!

33:49.000 --> 33:49.999
You good?

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
Yes. It's him, it's Kholokov.

33:56.800 --> 34:02.800
Nice job.

34:39.500 --> 34:43.364
Los Angeles+

34:43.400 --> 34:44.799
You want me to hypnotize you?

34:44.800 --> 34:48.600
I want you to take me back to whenever
it was when I first saw the puzzle.

34:48.635 --> 34:50.498
But you say you don't remember ever
seeing that puzzle.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.199
I must have.

34:52.199 --> 34:53.498
Agent Bristow,

34:53.500 --> 34:55.498
I've seen your profile.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.499
Your spatial intelligence is stellar.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.899
It's no surprise that you
can solve the puzzle.

34:59.900 --> 35:02.465
But I wasn't solving it.

35:02.500 --> 35:06.800
When I was standing there, staring at the puzzle,
it was like I remembered where every piece belonged.

35:06.835 --> 35:10.165
There wasn't any thought involved.

35:10.200 --> 35:13.965
You said the KGB developed a similar project,

35:14.000 --> 35:18.100
it's possible that my mother knew
the techniques and maybe she...

35:18.135 --> 35:21.865
Agent Bristow...

35:21.900 --> 35:25.465
if you are looking to uncover a trauma
then I need to warn you.

35:25.500 --> 35:30.900
Hypnotic regression can trigger severe
nightmares, flashbacks, acute depression...

35:30.935 --> 35:32.599
Understand that, to do what I do,

35:32.600 --> 35:35.765
maintain my cover at SD-6,
I compartmentalize a lot.

35:35.800 --> 35:40.700
But the idea that I might have been
programmed to be a spy,

35:40.735 --> 35:43.765
I can't tuck that away.

35:43.800 --> 35:49.800
I need to know what happened to me.

35:53.100 --> 35:55.700
Uh, excuse me, sir, I analyzed the wine.

35:55.735 --> 36:01.700
Is this a good time?

36:02.400 --> 36:04.199
There are no fingerprints on the glass.

36:04.200 --> 36:08.700
The wine is a '99 Hadley Cabernet Franc,

36:08.735 --> 36:10.899
unremarkable vintage.

36:10.900 --> 36:15.400
What is remarkable is what I extracted
from inside the wine.

36:15.435 --> 36:17.799
I was so surprised I redid the test

36:17.800 --> 36:19.899
but I'm certain.

36:19.900 --> 36:22.199
It's VTX,

36:22.200 --> 36:25.200
a calcium-based antidote.

36:25.235 --> 36:26.399
Extremely scarce.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.399
Antidote to what?

36:27.400 --> 36:29.799
Uh, mainly heart attack inducing toxins.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.600
Kertotic acid, um, sodium morphate.

36:33.635 --> 36:35.399
VTX simulates death,

36:35.400 --> 36:38.165
it slows the lungs, nearly stops the heart,

36:38.200 --> 36:42.700
which is how it prevents the poisons
from causing cardiac arrest.

36:42.735 --> 36:44.899
And then the VTX is, uh, is metabolized.

36:44.900 --> 36:49.265
The, uh, body, it returns to normal.

36:49.300 --> 36:53.300
So if someone who was poisoned
by sodium morphate

36:53.335 --> 36:56.565
were given VTX

36:56.600 --> 36:58.099
they would appear to die.

36:58.100 --> 36:59.599
Yes, sir.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.800
Well, assuming they had no other
heart conditions,

37:02.835 --> 37:04.899
in eight to twelve hours, then they

37:04.900 --> 37:09.265
they would be just fine.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.865
I'm going to count back from three.

37:11.900 --> 37:17.600
When I get to one, I want you to
tell me where you are.

37:17.635 --> 37:23.600
3... 2... 1.

37:44.600 --> 37:48.400
It's me...

37:48.435 --> 37:52.165
in my room.

37:52.200 --> 37:56.265
When I was little.

37:56.300 --> 38:02.300
Tell me if you see anything that resembles
the puzzle we're looking for.

38:04.700 --> 38:10.700
I'm taking care of Christmas...
that'll be soon.

38:11.300 --> 38:17.300
Christmas is all set...

38:24.000 --> 38:28.265
Yes. I see it.

38:28.300 --> 38:31.000
Nothing can happen to you now, Sydney.

38:31.035 --> 38:35.565
You're safe.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.500
Sydney, I want you to listen to me.

38:38.535 --> 38:41.465
Just breathe. Breathe.

38:41.500 --> 38:47.500
Focus on the puzzle. Focus on the puzzle.

38:49.700 --> 38:54.350
Good, Sydney.

38:54.385 --> 38:59.000
Very good.

39:11.900 --> 39:17.900
Look around you, tell me who else
is in the room.

39:22.200 --> 39:28.200
Good work, Sydney.

39:36.300 --> 39:42.300
Sydney, get in!

39:47.500 --> 39:53.500
What is it?

39:54.000 --> 39:59.100
I have this memory when I was six years old.

39:59.135 --> 40:04.200
My mother had just died in a car accident.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.299
I felt so scared.

40:06.300 --> 40:08.299
You were never home,

40:08.300 --> 40:10.699
so who was going to take care of me?

40:10.700 --> 40:12.699
Then I overheard you talking.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.365
You were in your study on the phone.

40:16.400 --> 40:20.650
You were talking about Christmas, about me.

40:20.685 --> 40:24.900
You were taking care of my Christmas presents.

40:24.935 --> 40:29.867
Suddenly, I-I felt so safe.

40:29.902 --> 40:34.800
You were taking care of me.

40:34.835 --> 40:37.099
That memory's a lie.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.199
You weren't talking about that at all.

40:39.200 --> 40:39.699
Sydney.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.599
I've seen the footage.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.699
Mom's briefing with her KGB handler.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.465
She was sent here for one specific purpose,

40:46.500 --> 40:50.800
to steal information from you about
a project you were developing for the CIA.

40:50.835 --> 40:56.800
An operation to train children to be
American spies.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.865
Project Christmas.

41:02.900 --> 41:05.565
Ever since Mom came back,

41:05.600 --> 41:09.100
you were afraid she'd figure out
what you did to me.

41:09.135 --> 41:11.399
You weren't trying to protect me from her,

41:11.400 --> 41:15.465
you were trying to protect your secret.

41:15.500 --> 41:19.600
So the first opportunity you had,
you set her up...

41:19.635 --> 41:20.399
in Madagascar.

41:20.400 --> 41:23.600
Sydney, understand something...

41:23.635 --> 41:27.217
No, Dad, you understand something.

41:27.252 --> 41:31.726
You took away my choices in life.

41:31.761 --> 41:36.980
You programmed me to be a spy.

41:37.015 --> 41:42.200
I will never forgive you for this.
