WEBVTT

00:02.017 --> 00:03.314
You have to hold him still.

00:03.315 --> 00:04.915
That's what
I'm attempting to do.

00:05.769 --> 00:08.637
I swear he gets more fidgety
every time we try and do this.

00:08.639 --> 00:10.872
Okay, well, we can
scrap your theory

00:10.874 --> 00:12.941
because this music
is not soothing him.

00:12.943 --> 00:15.410
That's not why
I'm enduring this tune.

00:15.412 --> 00:16.945
Tortoises have terrible hearing.

00:16.947 --> 00:18.213
The music is for you.

00:18.215 --> 00:20.282
You said you used to
listen to spa music

00:20.284 --> 00:22.117
when you operated
on patients.

00:22.119 --> 00:24.452
I thought it might reduce
your agita

00:24.454 --> 00:26.688
during this bothersome task.

00:26.690 --> 00:29.691
You're equating
cardiothoracic surgery

00:29.693 --> 00:32.060
with filing a
tortoise's toenails?

00:32.061 --> 00:33.762
Just not too short.

00:33.764 --> 00:35.430
They're his natural defenses.

00:35.432 --> 00:36.798
Against what?

00:36.800 --> 00:38.199
Tomorrow never knows.

00:38.201 --> 00:39.968
Mmm.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.642
Hey, Dad.

00:47.644 --> 00:50.579
When was this?

00:51.747 --> 00:53.348
Okay.

00:53.350 --> 00:55.817
Okay, let-let me make some
calls on my end, and then...

00:55.819 --> 00:57.652
you keep me posted.
I'll call you back.

00:57.654 --> 00:58.987
Bye.

01:00.122 --> 01:02.257
- What's wrong?
- It's my mom.

01:02.259 --> 01:04.759
She's not supposed to drive
because of her Alzheimer's.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.095
She took the car this morning,
has not come back.

01:07.097 --> 01:08.430
She's missing.

01:09.966 --> 01:11.967
Mr. Stanton,
I'm Captain Gregson.

01:11.969 --> 01:13.568
This is Detective Bell.

01:13.570 --> 01:15.437
You know
why you're here?

01:15.439 --> 01:18.039
He said it was about
Alexis Garland.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.275
I-I just heard.
Is she really dead?

01:20.277 --> 01:23.178
Shot and dumped
in the Hudson.

01:24.146 --> 01:25.480
That's terrible.

01:25.482 --> 01:28.583
But I don't know
if I can be of any help.

01:28.585 --> 01:30.251
We disagree.

01:30.253 --> 01:32.287
We've been talking
to her friends.

01:32.289 --> 01:34.122
There really wasn't anywhere
else for us to start.

01:34.124 --> 01:35.924
No crime scene,
no murder weapon,

01:35.926 --> 01:37.626
no obvious motive.

01:37.628 --> 01:39.461
But we started
hearing whispers.

01:39.463 --> 01:40.929
Couple of women

01:40.931 --> 01:43.598
Alexis worked out with
thought maybe you two

01:43.600 --> 01:45.467
were having an affair.

01:45.469 --> 01:48.169
There's a lot of gossip
at our gym.

01:48.171 --> 01:49.671
Most of it's nonsense.

01:49.673 --> 01:52.207
Alexis was my client.

01:52.209 --> 01:53.942
I trained her for
a couple of months,

01:53.944 --> 01:56.478
but we barely knew each other.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.812
Come on, Jeff.

01:57.814 --> 02:00.215
We found the e-mails
you two sent.

02:00.217 --> 02:01.549
Alexis deleted
most of them

02:01.551 --> 02:03.451
so her husband
wouldn't find out,

02:03.453 --> 02:07.055
but there's deleted,
and then there's deleted.

02:07.057 --> 02:09.424
Okay, look.

02:09.425 --> 02:12.894
Uh, Alexis and I...
we were...

02:12.896 --> 02:15.230
You were having
a lot of sex.

02:16.399 --> 02:18.333
Look, I shouldn't have lied
to you guys,

02:18.335 --> 02:20.235
but she's dead.

02:20.237 --> 02:21.936
Why ruin her reputation, right?

02:21.938 --> 02:23.805
That never bothered you before.

02:23.807 --> 02:25.907
You were obsessed
with her.

02:25.909 --> 02:28.209
You asked her
to leave her husband.

02:28.211 --> 02:30.812
When she refused,
you killed her.

02:30.814 --> 02:33.081
I-I would never hurt Alexis.

02:33.083 --> 02:34.816
I-I want a lawyer.

02:34.818 --> 02:36.718
I'm not answering
any more of your questions.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.153
You don't have to.

02:38.155 --> 02:40.188
We already have
all the proof we need.

02:40.190 --> 02:42.190
I pulled your old Navy records.

02:42.192 --> 02:43.992
You're colorblind.

02:43.994 --> 02:46.361
That's why they wouldn't let you
try out for the SEALs.

02:46.363 --> 02:47.429
So what?

02:47.431 --> 02:49.030
So, we went
to your apartment

02:49.032 --> 02:50.865
this morning
after you left for work.

02:50.867 --> 02:52.200
We had a warrant.

02:52.202 --> 02:53.501
Super let us in.

02:53.503 --> 02:55.136
There were traces of blood

02:55.138 --> 02:58.273
behind a panel of wallpaper
in your dining room.

02:58.275 --> 03:00.775
That's where
you shot Alexis.

03:00.777 --> 03:02.377
You couldn't clean
all her blood off

03:02.379 --> 03:05.346
because of the texture
of the wallpaper,

03:05.348 --> 03:07.048
so you just papered
over that section.

03:07.050 --> 03:08.349
You hung a new strip.

03:08.351 --> 03:09.884
You did a pretty
good job.

03:09.886 --> 03:11.186
Used the same company

03:11.188 --> 03:14.222
as the original paper,
same fish pattern,

03:14.224 --> 03:18.727
but, Jeff, this design comes in
a bunch of different variations.

03:18.729 --> 03:21.663
Your original wallpaper...

03:21.665 --> 03:23.531
had green fish.

03:23.533 --> 03:25.433
You bought
wallpaper with fish

03:25.435 --> 03:27.368
that are orange.

03:27.370 --> 03:30.138
Probably looked perfect
to you, but to us,

03:30.140 --> 03:32.207
it stuck out
like a sore thumb.

03:32.209 --> 03:35.009
Just so you know,
that's the color

03:35.011 --> 03:38.847
of the prison jumpsuit
you're going to be wearing.

03:41.183 --> 03:43.818
Hey, it's Marcus Bell
over at the 11th.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.353
Got some good news.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.722
The perp in the Garland case
wants to cut a deal.

03:47.724 --> 03:48.890
His attorney is on the way.

03:48.892 --> 03:51.459
Can you send
the riding ADA over?

03:52.294 --> 03:54.929
Great. Thanks.

04:00.836 --> 04:03.304
Hey, whose bag is this?

04:04.340 --> 04:06.808
Somebody leave this here?

04:07.676 --> 04:09.110
Anybody?

04:17.418 --> 04:18.486
Go, go! Go!

04:20.000 --> 04:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:28.531 --> 04:29.798
What's going on?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.132
Uh, Myers.

04:31.134 --> 04:33.535
Take off your coat, and seal
the bottom of that door.

04:33.537 --> 04:34.869
Go! Now!

04:51.620 --> 04:54.322
Marcus?
What the hell's going on?

04:54.324 --> 04:56.057
Why did I just put my coat
on the floor?

04:56.059 --> 04:57.525
Go get the captain.

04:57.527 --> 04:59.127
Tell him he's gotta
quarantine the building.

04:59.129 --> 05:00.628
What are you
talking about?

05:00.630 --> 05:02.230
Tell him there's been
a biological attack.

05:02.232 --> 05:03.498
Go! Now.

05:09.594 --> 05:13.594

05:39.690 --> 05:42.301
I want all the doors locked.
I want all the windows sealed.

05:42.302 --> 05:44.435
Nobody goes in or out.
Detective, get on the horn

05:44.437 --> 05:45.768
with the Operations Unit.

05:45.868 --> 05:48.183
Tell them we're at
mobilization level two.

05:48.184 --> 05:50.540
I need a perimeter
around the building.

05:50.541 --> 05:53.435
And get a Strategic
Response Group down here.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.003
Valdez, go get
as many first-aid kits

05:55.005 --> 05:57.071
as you can and bring
them back here.

05:57.073 --> 05:59.324
And make sure that the
stairwells are cleared, too.

05:59.325 --> 06:00.009
That's been done.

06:00.010 --> 06:02.110
I was by the stairs when
you called the quarantine.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.212
Nobody went up or down,
and the elevator hasn't moved.

06:04.214 --> 06:06.147
Good. Let's keep it that way.

06:06.149 --> 06:09.013
I want everybody
sheltering in place

06:09.014 --> 06:10.681
on the floor that they're on.

06:10.683 --> 06:12.416
Get the CDC on the phone.

06:12.418 --> 06:14.718
Tell them we've been hit by
some kind of aerosol attack.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.254
Whatever it is, tell them
they need to hurry,

06:17.256 --> 06:19.723
'cause one of our own
got a face-full.

06:22.747 --> 06:25.149
Marcus, talk to me.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.784
You all right?

06:26.786 --> 06:28.119
I don't know.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.988
The device in the bag
kept spraying me.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.556
I'm gonna stay in here.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.226
I-I don't want to put
anyone else at risk.

06:36.728 --> 06:38.529
All right,
we're getting you help, okay?

06:38.531 --> 06:39.930
It's on the way.

06:39.932 --> 06:41.765
How do you feel?

06:41.767 --> 06:43.901
Well, my heart's beating
pretty fast,

06:43.903 --> 06:46.237
but I think that's just nerves.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.773
Whatever hit me, I don't think
I'm feeling it yet.

06:51.176 --> 06:53.677
It's a hell of a thing you did.

06:55.113 --> 06:57.314
Where are we
on quarantine?

06:57.316 --> 06:59.283
We're following
the playbook.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.918
Precinct's on lockdown.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.920
CDC's on its way.

07:16.334 --> 07:18.736
Look, I don't think
it was a coincidence,

07:18.738 --> 07:21.539
this thing going off
right after I found it.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.008
What do you mean?

07:24.010 --> 07:25.576
Well, the bag
wasn't in the hall

07:25.578 --> 07:27.245
when I came through for
the Stanton interview.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.913
That means it couldn't
have been sitting there

07:28.915 --> 07:31.088
for more than a couple minutes
before I found it.

07:31.089 --> 07:32.755
I'm looking at
the thing now.

07:32.757 --> 07:35.058
There's a cell phone
trigger on it.

07:35.060 --> 07:38.628
Wait.
You're thinking whoever did this

07:38.630 --> 07:41.531
set it off a minute or two
after they planted it?

07:41.533 --> 07:44.267
Yeah, and I don't think
that was the plan.

07:44.269 --> 07:46.603
No.

07:46.605 --> 07:49.973
They'd want to be further away,
clear of the building.

07:49.975 --> 07:51.808
Exactly.

07:51.810 --> 07:53.910
But I found it right away.
I called it out.

07:53.912 --> 07:55.745
I think they still
had eyes on it.

07:55.747 --> 07:57.981
They were here,
they saw me find it,

07:57.983 --> 08:00.683
so they set it off before
I could get rid of it.

08:00.685 --> 08:02.485
Nobody's left the floor
since it went off.

08:02.487 --> 08:05.054
So, if you're right,
the person who did this

08:05.056 --> 08:06.522
is still here with us.

08:06.524 --> 08:08.257
My brother and my mom's friends

08:08.259 --> 08:09.392
have not heard from her.

08:09.394 --> 08:11.060
I left a message for the captain

08:11.062 --> 08:13.196
to put out a BOLO, and I think
I'm gonna go see my...

08:13.198 --> 08:15.231
Joanie, finally.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.100
Where have you been?
We're going to be late.

08:17.102 --> 08:18.635
You didn't
hear me calling you.

08:18.637 --> 08:20.436
Your mother is here.

08:22.973 --> 08:25.274
Is something wrong?

08:26.377 --> 08:29.112
No. I just wasn't
expecting you.

08:29.114 --> 08:31.180
Oh, you forgot.

08:31.182 --> 08:33.616
We're supposed to have lunch
at Fratello's.

08:35.052 --> 08:38.287
Mom, Fratello's has been closed
for three years.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.126
I'm fine. I just...

08:45.062 --> 08:47.463
It's just confusing.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.901
Did I not tell you
where I was going?

08:52.836 --> 08:54.337
When she got
diagnosed,

08:54.339 --> 08:56.839
I knew days like
this were coming.

08:56.841 --> 08:58.241
She was doing so well.

08:58.243 --> 09:00.009
I mean, she was taking
care of herself.

09:00.011 --> 09:01.778
She was playing mah-jongg
with her friends.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.680
I mean, she gets confused,
but nothing like this.

09:03.682 --> 09:06.516
Showing up for a luncheon
that happened four years ago?

09:06.518 --> 09:09.419
Guess we're entering
a new phase.

09:09.421 --> 09:10.887
Sorry.

09:10.889 --> 09:13.189
I mean, sometimes
I think it's worse

09:13.191 --> 09:15.625
when she's clear-headed,
because...

09:15.627 --> 09:18.261
then she really understands
how bad it's getting.

09:18.263 --> 09:20.596
Your stepfather's
gonna be here soon.

09:20.598 --> 09:22.231
Go on.
I'll call the captain.

09:22.233 --> 09:24.434
I'll tell him
to cancel the alert.

09:29.808 --> 09:31.107
Officer Rossi.

09:31.109 --> 09:32.341
Yes, it's Sherlock Holmes.

09:32.343 --> 09:33.576
I'm calling for Captain Gregson.

09:33.578 --> 09:34.977
Why are you answering his phone?

09:34.979 --> 09:36.746
Listen, you'll have
to call back later.

09:36.748 --> 09:37.880
We're under quarantine,

09:37.882 --> 09:39.282
and it's a little hectic here.

09:39.284 --> 09:41.084
What do you mean,
you're under quarantine?

09:42.553 --> 09:45.688
Babícora Police Station
in Juárez.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.356
Two years ago,
the León Cartel

09:47.358 --> 09:49.258
used a homemade
smoke bomb there.

09:49.260 --> 09:51.094
Aerosolized anthrax.

09:51.096 --> 09:52.762
12 officers got sick.

09:52.764 --> 09:54.230
Seven died.

09:54.232 --> 09:56.299
The bomb was in an
unattended piece of luggage,

09:56.301 --> 09:58.334
and it was detonated
via cell phone.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.569
Yeah.

09:59.571 --> 10:01.137
That does sound familiar.

10:01.139 --> 10:02.939
Last year, you said Major Cases

10:02.941 --> 10:06.209
was going to lead for the NYPD
against the León Cartel.

10:06.211 --> 10:08.077
You took over
from the Narcotics Unit

10:08.079 --> 10:09.979
in November, correct?

10:09.981 --> 10:12.849
Yeah, the brass wanted
more resources put on 'em.

10:12.851 --> 10:14.584
We've seized some
of their shipments

10:14.586 --> 10:16.853
and rolled up some
of their middle management.

10:16.855 --> 10:18.721
We have 'em on the run.

10:18.723 --> 10:19.956
Sounds like they hit back hard.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.491
Maybe.

10:21.493 --> 10:24.660
We haven't had any cartel people
in here today,

10:24.662 --> 10:27.964
but I guess they could have used
a civilian cutout.

10:27.966 --> 10:30.366
If this is another
anthrax attack,

10:30.368 --> 10:33.035
there are treatments which
can reduce lethality.

10:33.037 --> 10:35.404
Guys, we're getting ahead
of ourselves here.

10:35.406 --> 10:37.507
The CDC just landed downstairs.

10:37.509 --> 10:39.876
We're gonna know
a lot more soon.

10:39.878 --> 10:42.378
Well, maybe not as quickly
as you think.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.148
Identifying diseases can take
hours; in some cases, days.

10:45.150 --> 10:47.216
We need to find out
what you got hit with

10:47.218 --> 10:48.918
so we can get you
treatment in time.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.054
You're thinking about
approaching the cartel?

10:52.056 --> 10:53.723
Guys...

10:53.725 --> 10:56.492
if they did this,
do you seriously think

10:56.494 --> 10:58.961
they're gonna tell you
what was in the gas?

10:58.963 --> 11:00.396
Depends how they're asked.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.998
Listen to me.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.734
Today is already a bad day.

11:04.736 --> 11:08.971
I do not need two more
of my people in harm's way.

11:08.973 --> 11:10.373
Now, listen.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.841
I gotta go deal with the CDC.

11:11.843 --> 11:13.476
We're gonna get this
figured out.

11:13.478 --> 11:15.411
Do not go talk

11:15.413 --> 11:17.013
to the León Cartel.

11:21.952 --> 11:23.319
You heard what he said.

11:23.321 --> 11:25.454
I did. He doesn't want
to see us killed.

11:25.456 --> 11:28.124
Unfortunately, I feel
the same way about him.

11:35.265 --> 11:37.667
Captain Gregson,
I'm Bridget Tanaka,

11:37.669 --> 11:40.036
head of the CDC's
Emergency Response Team.

11:40.038 --> 11:42.038
How long ago was the attack?

11:43.173 --> 11:45.308
It was 28 minutes ago.

11:45.310 --> 11:46.843
You've done a great job

11:46.845 --> 11:48.878
quarantining the building,
from what I can see.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.847
My team's gonna help
with the lockdown,

11:50.849 --> 11:53.549
make sure nobody's in
any immediate medical danger.

11:53.551 --> 11:55.084
I don't think anyone's sick yet.

11:55.086 --> 11:56.786
I'm taking that to mean
that the attack

11:56.788 --> 11:58.721
must have been biological
rather than chemical.

11:58.723 --> 12:01.524
If it was chemical, it would
have hit us a lot faster, right?

12:01.526 --> 12:04.694
Probably, but we can't
rule anything out yet.

12:04.696 --> 12:06.896
We're gonna need
to examine the device.

12:06.898 --> 12:09.332
It's the fastest way
to determine what was in it.

12:09.334 --> 12:12.869
Any luck, we'll have you all
diagnosed, decontaminated

12:12.871 --> 12:16.205
and on your way to the hospital
in four, five hours.

12:16.207 --> 12:19.575
Until then, I need everyone
to sit tight and stay calm.

12:19.577 --> 12:21.010
This everybody on the floor?

12:21.012 --> 12:23.412
No, we have a detective,
Marcus Bell--

12:23.414 --> 12:24.847
he sealed himself off.

12:24.849 --> 12:26.849
He's the one who
found the device.

12:26.851 --> 12:28.784
He was exposed
pretty heavily.

12:28.786 --> 12:30.686
We'll run him
through a decon shower,

12:30.688 --> 12:32.388
get him a change of clothes.

12:32.390 --> 12:35.324
After that, he can join everyone
out here while my team works.

12:35.326 --> 12:36.559
You sure?

12:36.561 --> 12:38.227
If it was
a chemical attack,

12:38.229 --> 12:40.096
he'll be safe
once his clothing and skin

12:40.098 --> 12:41.864
have been decontaminated.

12:41.866 --> 12:43.499
If it was biological,

12:43.501 --> 12:45.468
any pathogen will need time
to incubate

12:45.470 --> 12:47.737
before the host
becomes contagious.

12:47.739 --> 12:50.973
You'll all be in a hospital
for observation by then.

12:50.975 --> 12:52.875
Um...

12:54.311 --> 12:57.380
I just found out there
was a similar attack

12:57.382 --> 12:59.949
on a police station in
Mexico a couple years ago.

12:59.951 --> 13:03.386
Might be the same people
who did that did this.

13:03.388 --> 13:05.621
That time, they
used anthrax.

13:05.623 --> 13:07.290
We'll test for that first.

13:07.292 --> 13:09.825
But frankly, we might not know
what we're looking at

13:09.827 --> 13:11.761
until people start getting sick.

13:11.763 --> 13:13.796
Symptoms usually tell us
what we're up against

13:13.798 --> 13:15.264
before our tests can confirm it.

13:15.266 --> 13:17.566
Clearing two now.

13:19.036 --> 13:20.436
Copy. Five minutes.

13:20.438 --> 13:23.239
Anything else I need
to know, Captain?

13:24.107 --> 13:26.309
Uh, come in here.

13:28.612 --> 13:31.948
There's a cell phone attached
to that aerosol device.

13:31.950 --> 13:34.617
I'm assuming you can
decontaminate it for me.

13:34.619 --> 13:36.352
Of course. Why?

13:37.689 --> 13:39.889
We think the person
that set it off

13:39.891 --> 13:41.824
might be on the floor with us.

13:41.826 --> 13:44.093
You think one of these people...

13:44.095 --> 13:46.562
If there's any prints
or anything else on that phone

13:46.564 --> 13:48.631
that could shed some light
on who did this...

13:48.633 --> 13:50.366
Are my people safe?

13:50.368 --> 13:51.801
They should be alert,

13:51.803 --> 13:54.036
but if I'm right
and the perp is out there,

13:54.038 --> 13:56.405
I don't think they meant
this as a suicide mission.

13:56.407 --> 13:58.407
The only reason they
triggered the device

13:58.409 --> 14:01.544
is because we found it sooner
than we were supposed to.

14:01.546 --> 14:04.613
Whoever it is,
they're dangerous,

14:04.615 --> 14:06.282
but they're trying to keep
their head down,

14:06.284 --> 14:08.951
they're trying
to get out of here unnoticed.

14:08.953 --> 14:11.220
I'm trying to prevent that
from happening.

14:11.222 --> 14:12.655
Okay.

14:12.657 --> 14:16.192
I'll get you that phone
as soon as I can.

14:17.461 --> 14:19.595
- Are you sure about this?
- No.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.164
I'd much rather talk to these
people with the police,

14:22.166 --> 14:23.733
but we'd be the ones
getting arrested.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.601
Anyway...

14:30.073 --> 14:31.340
We're closed.

14:31.342 --> 14:32.742
Uh, yeah,
we're not customers.

14:32.744 --> 14:34.343
We're just... we'd like
to see the boss.

14:34.345 --> 14:36.946
- I am the boss.
- No.

14:36.948 --> 14:38.748
You're the nephew.
You're Lil' Javi.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.416
We're not interested
in the lil' boss.

14:40.418 --> 14:42.918
We'd like to talk to the
big boss, your Uncle Felipe.

14:44.321 --> 14:46.956
You got the wrong place.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.824
Don't play dumb with me.
You're not smart enough.

14:48.826 --> 14:50.459
Look, we are not
looking for trouble.

14:50.461 --> 14:51.761
We are consultants
with the NYPD.

14:51.763 --> 14:53.963
We know that your uncle
is in charge

14:53.965 --> 14:56.565
of the León Cartel
here in New York.

14:56.567 --> 14:59.068
I think you two should go now.

14:59.703 --> 15:00.703
Just don't...

15:00.705 --> 15:02.905
Get off!
Don't do that. No!

15:02.907 --> 15:03.839
Do you want your Mercedes back?

15:03.841 --> 15:05.307
- What?
- Your Mercedes.

15:05.309 --> 15:07.843
The G550 that was parked
out front. We stole it.

15:09.246 --> 15:11.080
I mean, it was a present
from your uncle, wasn't it?

15:11.082 --> 15:13.082
He'd be very upset
to know that you'd lost it.

15:13.084 --> 15:14.350
But I'm quite happy
to give it back

15:14.352 --> 15:15.684
if you just-just...

15:15.686 --> 15:17.486
take us to see him.

15:17.488 --> 15:19.889
How do you expect
to get away with this?

15:19.891 --> 15:22.691
Your uncle is going to want
to hear what we have to say.

15:22.693 --> 15:25.795
So you take us to see him,
you're gonna be a hero.

15:31.401 --> 15:33.569
Hey. CDC cleaned me up.

15:33.571 --> 15:35.905
Lucky for me, I had a
change of clothes here.

15:35.907 --> 15:38.674
They say I'm as safe to be
around as anyone now, so...

15:38.676 --> 15:40.376
What are those?

15:40.378 --> 15:44.013
Uh, pulled 'em off the phone
that triggered the device.

15:44.015 --> 15:45.781
Looks like recon to me.

15:46.616 --> 15:48.184
So, whoever did this,

15:48.186 --> 15:49.452
they came here once before.

15:49.454 --> 15:50.920
They scouted the place.

15:50.922 --> 15:54.790
Time stamp on all of them
is 12:00 a.m. January 1.

15:55.792 --> 15:57.693
Our perp was here on New Year's?

15:57.695 --> 16:00.596
I forwarded everything
from the phone to CCS.

16:00.598 --> 16:03.632
They think the cell service
wasn't activated until today,

16:03.634 --> 16:07.036
and that zeroed out
all the time and date settings.

16:13.376 --> 16:15.978
Get him on his side now.

16:15.980 --> 16:17.546
I got a guy seizing up here.

16:17.548 --> 16:18.714
Send up a cart.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.783
Does anyone know this man?

16:20.785 --> 16:22.017
His name
is Vincent Wong.

16:22.019 --> 16:23.552
He was here giving
a witness statement

16:23.554 --> 16:25.087
about a missing girl
in Queens.

16:25.089 --> 16:27.756
Do you know where he was
when the device went off?

16:27.758 --> 16:29.258
I do.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.360
He was sitting in the hallway
near the duffel bag.

16:31.362 --> 16:33.429
He was right next to me.

16:50.063 --> 16:51.664
My sister's boy.

16:51.666 --> 16:54.300
He's not a genius.

16:54.302 --> 16:57.670
I don't know you,
so this will be brief.

16:57.672 --> 16:59.405
Say your piece.

16:59.407 --> 17:01.174
There was an act of terror
committed

17:01.176 --> 17:03.609
at the 11th precinct
this morning.

17:03.611 --> 17:05.912
I know. I saw the news.

17:05.914 --> 17:09.315
And to think,
it's not even my birthday.

17:09.317 --> 17:12.084
The León Cartel carried out
a similar attack

17:12.086 --> 17:13.685
in Juárez two years ago.

17:13.688 --> 17:15.354
That time, they used anthrax.

17:15.356 --> 17:17.323
We have friends at the 11th.

17:17.325 --> 17:19.592
We want to know
what your group used

17:19.594 --> 17:22.127
so they can get
the treatment they need.

17:23.664 --> 17:26.365
Well, since you ask--

17:26.367 --> 17:28.334
we had nothing to do with it.

17:28.336 --> 17:30.937
So I'm afraid I
cannot help them.

17:30.939 --> 17:33.639
Of course,
I wouldn't if I could.

17:33.641 --> 17:35.875
Even if I could serve up

17:35.877 --> 17:40.146
Doron Kolobkov's operation
to you on a platter?

17:41.381 --> 17:43.749
You've already pissed off
my nephew today.

17:43.751 --> 17:46.552
Now you want to make an enemy
of the Stepanov Bratva?

17:46.554 --> 17:48.221
Well, if I could,
that would make us

17:48.223 --> 17:50.056
something akin to friends,
wouldn't it?

17:50.058 --> 17:52.058
You've been fighting
the Russians

17:52.060 --> 17:53.993
for territory
in Queens.

17:53.995 --> 17:57.196
So you tell us
what was used in the attack,

17:57.198 --> 17:59.232
and I'll tell you
everything you need to know

17:59.234 --> 18:01.100
to choke off Doron's supply.

18:01.102 --> 18:05.271
And how, exactly,
would you have such information?

18:05.273 --> 18:07.640
I used to buy heroin from him.

18:08.281 --> 18:10.481
I see.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.117
I'm supposed to trust

18:13.119 --> 18:14.952
the word of a junkie?

18:14.954 --> 18:16.654
I'm not stupid enough
to lie to you.

18:16.656 --> 18:18.956
You can put your rival
out of business today,

18:18.958 --> 18:21.192
but if you want this deal,
it's gotta be now.

18:21.194 --> 18:22.727
The CDC will
have figured out

18:22.729 --> 18:24.795
what we're up against
by the end of the day.

18:24.797 --> 18:26.464
By then, we won't need you.

18:26.466 --> 18:29.033
There'll be no need to share
information with you.

18:29.035 --> 18:30.721
What about self-preservation?

18:30.722 --> 18:32.789
Not every cop in
New York's in quarantine.

18:32.791 --> 18:35.458
Some of them know
where we are.

18:38.696 --> 18:41.998
The man who built that device
in Juárez--

18:42.000 --> 18:43.966
he's dead.

18:44.902 --> 18:47.370
Frederico...

18:48.305 --> 18:49.739
His name is unimportant,

18:49.741 --> 18:53.309
but this man,
he was talented.

18:53.311 --> 18:56.646
We don't have anyone
else like him.

18:56.648 --> 19:00.083
I wish we could come
to some sort of understanding,

19:00.085 --> 19:04.987
but I'm afraid I don't have
the answers you're looking for.

19:07.591 --> 19:10.560
Tell your, uh, nephew
that his car is in a lot

19:10.562 --> 19:13.062
on Jamaica and 88th.

19:14.598 --> 19:18.534
This information you have
on the Stepanov Bratva--

19:18.536 --> 19:20.636
how much is it worth to you?

19:20.638 --> 19:22.939
It's not for sale.

19:27.478 --> 19:30.346
Don't get me wrong, I'm happy
to be out of that place,

19:30.348 --> 19:32.081
but you didn't
press the guy that hard.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.483
No need.

19:33.485 --> 19:35.084
Hey.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.954
Hi. We got some, uh...
well, bad news, I'm afraid.

19:37.956 --> 19:40.256
The León Cartel
is not trying to kill you.

19:40.258 --> 19:42.058
What are you talking about?

19:42.060 --> 19:44.827
Watson and I just had
a conversation with Felipe Diaz.

19:44.829 --> 19:47.430
Damn it. I told you...

19:47.432 --> 19:49.132
Oh, no, we're fine.
You're the ones in danger.

19:49.134 --> 19:50.566
And we still
don't know from what.

19:50.568 --> 19:52.101
But I don't think
the cartel did this.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.196
Why? 'Cause Felipe Diaz
denies it?

19:54.197 --> 19:56.665
He was in a chatty mood.
He gave us half the name

19:56.667 --> 19:58.099
of the architect
of their Juárez attack.

19:58.101 --> 19:59.234
Why would he do that?

19:59.236 --> 20:00.402
Because that man is dead.

20:00.404 --> 20:01.603
They don't have anyone else

20:01.605 --> 20:03.738
capable of cultivating
a biological agent

20:03.740 --> 20:05.206
or building a device
to deliver it.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.875
Between that
and Felipe's haptics,

20:06.877 --> 20:08.476
I think he was
telling the truth.

20:08.478 --> 20:10.311
You think the person
that planted the device

20:10.313 --> 20:11.680
is still in
there with you.

20:11.682 --> 20:13.381
Who else should
we be looking at?

20:13.383 --> 20:14.616
I don't know.

20:14.618 --> 20:16.151
I don't have
any obvious suspects.

20:16.153 --> 20:19.220
Marcus and I are about
to interview everyone here.

20:19.222 --> 20:21.823
One thing you could do is take
a look at some photographs

20:21.825 --> 20:24.325
we pulled off the phone
that triggered the device.

20:24.327 --> 20:26.961
I didn't find much useful
on them, but...

20:26.963 --> 20:28.630
a second set of eyes
couldn't hurt.

20:28.632 --> 20:30.598
I'll send it over to you.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.200
How's everyone else doing?

20:32.202 --> 20:34.703
Well, so far,
only one guy has gotten sick.

20:34.705 --> 20:37.038
He started seizing
about a half an hour ago.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.408
He's stable now,
but it wasn't pretty.

20:40.410 --> 20:41.576
What about Marcus?

20:41.578 --> 20:43.445
Let's just say he'd be doing

20:43.447 --> 20:45.780
a lot better if we knew
what to treat him for.

20:45.782 --> 20:47.849
We all would.

20:49.452 --> 20:51.186
I-I gotta go.

20:51.188 --> 20:54.389
We're gonna find out
who did this.

20:54.391 --> 20:56.791
Can you tell us who you are
and why you're here?

20:56.793 --> 20:58.226
My name is Natalie Park.

20:58.228 --> 20:59.828
I'm a hedge fund manager.

20:59.830 --> 21:01.229
Uh, Anthony Daniels.

21:01.231 --> 21:04.599
I teach second grade
at PS 635 in Brooklyn.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.935
Uh, I'm Lydia Winchell.
I'm a massage therapist.

21:06.937 --> 21:10.004
Hernán Cortes,
like the explorer.

21:10.006 --> 21:11.873
But I work for the MTA.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.942
I came down to file a complaint.

21:13.944 --> 21:17.078
My ex violated a restraining
order I have against him.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.280
Jaylen Thomas.
I saw a bar fight.

21:19.282 --> 21:21.116
Y'all had some questions
about it.

21:21.118 --> 21:23.651
My little brother got arrested
for stealing a car.

21:23.653 --> 21:25.587
I came down to bail him out.

21:25.589 --> 21:27.355
And rip his face off.

21:27.357 --> 21:29.257
My apartment got robbed.

21:29.259 --> 21:31.926
They told me to come down
to give a statement.

21:31.928 --> 21:33.962
How do you feel about cops?

21:33.964 --> 21:36.931
You have any reason
to be angry at the police?

21:36.933 --> 21:38.399
What? No.

21:38.401 --> 21:40.568
Nah, man.
I don't got a problem,

21:40.570 --> 21:42.504
long as y'all don't got
a problem with me.

21:42.506 --> 21:44.305
Why are you asking that?

21:44.307 --> 21:45.874
Am I suspect?

21:45.876 --> 21:47.909
I never had any issue
with cops.

21:47.911 --> 21:50.845
I'm sorry.
My head feels a little...

21:52.949 --> 21:54.215
What was the question?

21:54.217 --> 21:56.251
<i>Wait. Why are you asking?</i>

21:56.253 --> 21:59.120
Do you think the person
who did it is still here?

21:59.122 --> 22:00.355
The guy who got sick earlier--

22:00.357 --> 22:02.824
is that going to happen
to all of us?

22:02.826 --> 22:05.026
You can't be keeping us locked
up with some terrorist nut.

22:05.028 --> 22:06.494
You think I could carry in

22:06.496 --> 22:08.396
some big germ bomb
with this ankle?

22:08.398 --> 22:10.031
Is he?

22:10.033 --> 22:11.566
Out there with the others?

22:11.568 --> 22:13.268
If you think he's still here,
you have to tell us.

22:13.270 --> 22:15.303
We have a
right to know.

22:15.305 --> 22:17.005
All that shaking

22:17.007 --> 22:18.439
and the foam in his mouth.

22:18.441 --> 22:20.241
I don't want to have
to go through that.

22:20.243 --> 22:21.643
Can we take a break?

22:21.645 --> 22:23.178
I mean, my head's killing me,

22:23.180 --> 22:26.047
and my stomach's starting
to feel weird.

22:30.052 --> 22:32.654
That's two
feeling the effects now.

22:32.656 --> 22:34.956
Guy made a good
point about the bag.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.624
I mean, I've held
it in my hands.

22:36.626 --> 22:37.926
Not exactly a
loaf of bread.

22:37.928 --> 22:39.194
It's big and heavy.

22:39.196 --> 22:40.562
And metal.

22:40.564 --> 22:42.330
And didn't set off
the machines downstairs.

22:42.332 --> 22:44.566
Someone strong hauled
that thing in here,

22:44.568 --> 22:46.768
and they didn't come
in the front door.

22:48.571 --> 22:50.004
The roof.

22:50.006 --> 22:52.340
You remember when they
patched it last month?

22:52.342 --> 22:53.875
There were a dozen
construction workers

22:53.877 --> 22:55.977
using the freight elevator
all week.

22:55.979 --> 22:57.579
You think someone
stashed it here,

22:57.581 --> 22:59.881
and today someone else
went and got it?

22:59.883 --> 23:01.549
Probably worth
cross-checking the roofers

23:01.551 --> 23:03.418
against the folks
we got here today.

23:03.420 --> 23:06.154
Maybe we'll find
a connection.

23:08.524 --> 23:10.625
Wow.

23:10.627 --> 23:12.660
You're really good at this.

23:12.662 --> 23:14.929
You sound surprised.

23:16.031 --> 23:17.465
So, once I've finished,

23:17.467 --> 23:19.601
we should be one step
closer to identifying

23:19.603 --> 23:21.870
who planted the aerosol device
at the precinct.

23:21.872 --> 23:24.873
You said you wanted
to re-create the photos

23:24.875 --> 23:26.407
that TARU recovered.

23:26.409 --> 23:28.109
Yes, they're not
time-stamped,

23:28.111 --> 23:30.144
but the clock in
that photograph

23:30.146 --> 23:33.514
tells us it's 6:58 p.m.

23:33.516 --> 23:35.216
when it was taken
by the perpetrator.

23:35.218 --> 23:37.986
That gives us a time,
of course, but not a date.

23:37.988 --> 23:40.088
Luckily, there is ample
astronomical data

23:40.090 --> 23:42.423
to tell us the sun's
relationship to New York City

23:42.425 --> 23:44.125
every single day of the year.

23:44.127 --> 23:46.027
So we match the shadow pattern,

23:46.029 --> 23:47.929
we note the position
of the light,

23:47.931 --> 23:49.430
and that should give us the date

23:49.432 --> 23:51.366
in which the precinct
was scouted.

23:51.368 --> 23:53.401
We then look at
the visitor logs for that day,

23:53.403 --> 23:55.837
see who was here, and see
if anyone came back today.

23:55.839 --> 23:57.238
Right.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.507
But even if we I.D. the guy,
I can't imagine

23:59.509 --> 24:01.843
he's gonna tell us
what he knows so easily.

24:01.845 --> 24:04.045
One impossible problem
at a time, please.

24:05.848 --> 24:07.749
So, did your mother
and stepfather

24:07.751 --> 24:09.717
make it home safe and sound?

24:09.719 --> 24:10.985
Safe, yes.

24:10.987 --> 24:12.854
I'm not sure about sound.

24:12.856 --> 24:15.056
She locked herself in her
bedroom when she got home.

24:15.058 --> 24:16.257
She won't talk to him.

24:16.259 --> 24:17.592
She talking to anyone
these days?

24:17.594 --> 24:19.861
- Like a therapist?
- She needs to.

24:19.863 --> 24:21.663
She needs help
on a few different fronts.

24:21.665 --> 24:23.731
A home nurse
would be a good start.

24:23.733 --> 24:26.301
- She doesn't have one?
- I've tried broaching it.

24:26.303 --> 24:28.603
Eight months ago, I could see
she was struggling a little,

24:28.605 --> 24:30.338
so I suggested maybe
getting some help

24:30.340 --> 24:32.040
at the house
a few days a week.

24:32.042 --> 24:34.609
She wouldn't talk to me
for two weeks.

24:34.611 --> 24:38.346
It's hard facing a diminishing
of one's autonomy.

24:38.348 --> 24:40.315
Yeah, I gotta ask her again.

24:40.317 --> 24:42.317
Respectfully, it's not the way
that you're asking.

24:42.319 --> 24:44.018
It's that you're asking at all.

24:44.020 --> 24:45.987
You can't ask someone to hand
over the keys to their life.

24:45.989 --> 24:47.455
You have to demand them.

24:47.457 --> 24:49.490
Your mother's not going
to like the news, but...

24:49.492 --> 24:52.060
at least she's gonna hear it
from someone she loves.

24:53.362 --> 24:55.530
<i>All right.</i>

24:55.532 --> 24:57.999
So, one of the roofers
who was here last month,

24:58.001 --> 25:00.168
Dwayne Acker--
says on his social media

25:00.170 --> 25:02.036
he went to a concert
six months ago

25:02.038 --> 25:05.273
for a band called
Elegant Void.

25:06.375 --> 25:08.009
Yeah?

25:08.011 --> 25:10.411
Well, you know the masseuse
we talked to-- Lydia?

25:10.413 --> 25:12.747
She posted photos
from the same concert.

25:12.749 --> 25:14.315
They were both there.

25:14.317 --> 25:18.920
So the roofer volunteers
to stash a biological weapon,

25:18.922 --> 25:22.090
the masseuse promises
to set it off,

25:22.092 --> 25:24.726
and then they both go
to the mosh pit together.

25:24.728 --> 25:26.294
It's not my favorite theory,

25:26.296 --> 25:29.097
but I'm not seeing
any strong connections here.

25:30.700 --> 25:31.899
Captain, you got a minute?

25:31.901 --> 25:33.368
- How's it going?
- We're still trying

25:33.370 --> 25:35.370
to figure out
what was inside that device.

25:35.372 --> 25:37.538
Spores of some kind,
so we know it was biological,

25:37.540 --> 25:39.607
but no typology yet.

25:39.609 --> 25:41.009
We did find
something I thought

25:41.011 --> 25:42.076
you should know about.

25:42.078 --> 25:44.245
When we took
the thing apart,

25:44.247 --> 25:46.047
we saw the upper
section was bonded

25:46.049 --> 25:47.482
with a cyanoacrylate
adhesive.

25:47.484 --> 25:49.917
The glue was fully dry,
extremely sturdy.

25:49.919 --> 25:51.352
The lower section, though,

25:51.354 --> 25:52.754
that was a
different story.

25:52.756 --> 25:54.122
What do you mean?

25:54.124 --> 25:56.524
This canister that
the toxin was in--

25:56.526 --> 25:58.393
it was attached
to the detonator differently.

25:58.395 --> 26:00.661
It was stuck on there
with a resin epoxy,

26:00.663 --> 26:01.896
and it wasn't dry.

26:01.898 --> 26:03.231
Which means?

26:03.233 --> 26:05.066
The device came in two pieces.

26:05.068 --> 26:08.770
It was probably assembled just
moments before it was detonated.

26:09.605 --> 26:10.838
I gotta get back.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.141
You can hold on to that.

26:14.476 --> 26:15.877
If this thing
came in pieces,

26:15.879 --> 26:17.345
there's no reason to think

26:17.347 --> 26:19.714
the roofers had anything
to do with it.

26:19.716 --> 26:21.249
Sections this small,

26:21.251 --> 26:22.850
anybody could've
smuggled them in separately

26:22.852 --> 26:25.553
and built them
right here.

26:25.555 --> 26:28.322
We're back to square one.

26:35.564 --> 26:37.365
Down a bit.

26:40.602 --> 26:42.203
Down a bit.

26:43.439 --> 26:44.439
Stop.

26:44.441 --> 26:45.440
There?

26:45.442 --> 26:47.508
There. Lock it down.

26:50.512 --> 26:52.713
All right.

26:52.715 --> 26:56.150
For the sun to have cast
that angle of light

26:56.152 --> 26:59.654
at exactly 6:58 p.m.,

26:59.656 --> 27:01.589
the photograph must have
been taken on...

27:01.591 --> 27:02.824
July 2.

27:02.826 --> 27:04.325
You sure?

27:04.327 --> 27:06.094
I'll spare you a lecture
on solar orbits

27:06.096 --> 27:08.396
and heavenly mathematics
and just say yes, I'm sure.

27:09.498 --> 27:11.332
What is it?

27:12.167 --> 27:14.202
July 2.

27:14.204 --> 27:15.570
We had that
union meeting.

27:15.572 --> 27:16.771
The whole floor
was closed down

27:16.773 --> 27:18.406
for three hours
that night.

27:18.408 --> 27:20.675
The only people up here
when those photos were taken

27:20.677 --> 27:22.477
were cops from our precinct.

27:22.479 --> 27:24.011
If that's true, then...

27:24.013 --> 27:26.214
One of our own did this.

27:41.641 --> 27:43.442
Captain?

27:43.444 --> 27:45.844
Sherlock and Joan
have something.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.515
Take a look at Sean O'Grady.

27:49.517 --> 27:51.884
Shield number 42330.

27:51.886 --> 27:53.218
O'Grady?

27:53.220 --> 27:54.787
He's not my favorite cop,

27:54.789 --> 27:56.688
but the guy's
a solid citizen.

27:56.690 --> 27:59.324
Well, so was Timothy McVeigh
right up until he wasn't.

27:59.326 --> 28:01.427
We've been looking
through the NYPD database

28:01.429 --> 28:04.062
and going through
personnel records.

28:04.064 --> 28:06.765
O'Grady checks off
all the wrong boxes.

28:06.767 --> 28:09.334
And he seems to have a grudge
against the department.

28:09.336 --> 28:10.869
What are you talking about?

28:10.871 --> 28:12.838
Before he
transferred to the 11th,

28:12.840 --> 28:16.608
he was given command discipline
for conduct unbecoming twice.

28:16.610 --> 28:18.911
He was unhappy that he was
passed over for promotion,

28:18.913 --> 28:20.779
and then he was suspended
for 30 days

28:20.781 --> 28:23.081
after shoving
his commanding officer.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.184
It's a big leap from disgruntled
officer to bioterrorist,

28:25.186 --> 28:27.419
but at the moment,
he's the only suspect we have.

28:27.421 --> 28:29.054
Okay.

28:29.056 --> 28:31.723
We'll talk to him.

28:31.725 --> 28:34.092
Hey, Sean.

28:34.094 --> 28:36.428
Can you join me in the
conference room for a sec?

28:36.430 --> 28:37.830
Sure, Captain.
What's up?

28:37.832 --> 28:40.265
Oh, I just want to have
a quick chat.

28:41.434 --> 28:43.135
Marcus, are you
flanking me?

28:49.876 --> 28:51.009
What's going on?

28:51.011 --> 28:52.811
Am I in some kind
of trouble here?

28:52.813 --> 28:54.313
Do me a favor, Sergeant.

28:54.315 --> 28:57.216
Can I have your firearm, please?

29:10.063 --> 29:12.064
Whatever you want.

29:14.701 --> 29:17.035
Come on.
You don't actually think

29:17.037 --> 29:19.404
I'm involved in this, do you?

29:19.406 --> 29:22.641
There were at least 30 cops
in that union meeting.

29:22.643 --> 29:24.176
Gotta be ten of
those same guys

29:24.178 --> 29:25.511
back here today.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.045
How's that make me
the prime suspect?

29:27.047 --> 29:28.313
It doesn't,
but there were

29:28.315 --> 29:29.915
a few things
in your personnel file

29:29.917 --> 29:31.583
we wanted to go over.

29:31.585 --> 29:32.885
It's our understanding you were

29:32.887 --> 29:35.153
passed over for promotion
to lieutenant.

29:35.155 --> 29:36.655
Is that what this is about?

29:36.657 --> 29:38.090
The promotion thing?

29:38.092 --> 29:39.825
Yeah, I was upset

29:39.827 --> 29:41.460
when I got passed over.

29:41.462 --> 29:43.362
I said so. That was it.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.398
Look, getting your feelings hurt
and shoving your C.O.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.166
are two different things.

29:48.168 --> 29:50.602
I got a temper, okay?

29:50.604 --> 29:54.439
But I apologized for it.
I made it right.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.942
I notice you're not
wearing your ring.

29:56.944 --> 29:59.077
I know you're married.

29:59.079 --> 30:01.113
I met your wife
last Christmas.

30:01.115 --> 30:03.482
Something happen?

30:05.184 --> 30:07.352
We're taking a little break.

30:07.354 --> 30:08.987
How little?

30:08.989 --> 30:11.523
Going on five months.

30:11.525 --> 30:14.126
She want a divorce?

30:15.128 --> 30:16.762
I know what
that's like.

30:16.764 --> 30:19.765
Throws your whole world
out of whack.

30:19.767 --> 30:21.633
When my wife and I split...

30:21.635 --> 30:23.268
I was, uh...

30:23.270 --> 30:25.571
hmm, lost.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.973
So, obviously, you went out
and built some weird smoke bomb

30:27.975 --> 30:30.208
and you set it off
around a bunch of cops.

30:30.210 --> 30:31.677
'Cause that's what guys

30:31.679 --> 30:33.946
like us do, right?

30:33.948 --> 30:35.781
I'm a police officer.

30:35.783 --> 30:37.583
I didn't do this.

30:37.585 --> 30:38.850
<i>Since we missed lunch,</i>

30:38.852 --> 30:41.153
I brought you your leftovers.

30:41.155 --> 30:43.121
What is that mush,
anyway?

30:43.123 --> 30:44.690
It is mush.

30:44.692 --> 30:47.593
It's this, uh, apple
and potato porridge--

30:47.595 --> 30:49.428
17th-century
English recipe.

30:49.430 --> 30:52.497
Oh, certainly smells
like it's 400 years old.

30:52.499 --> 30:54.266
How's it going?

30:54.268 --> 30:56.034
Well, I've been giving
Officer O'Grady's background

30:56.036 --> 30:57.769
the attention it deserves,

30:57.771 --> 31:00.772
and I found a curiosity
in his file.

31:00.774 --> 31:03.942
Six years ago, he received
the NYPD's Combat Cross.

31:03.944 --> 31:06.511
He survived a shooting
in the line of duty.

31:06.513 --> 31:07.679
Killed his assailant.

31:07.681 --> 31:08.847
Strange thing is,

31:08.849 --> 31:10.515
it happened in Staten Island

31:10.517 --> 31:13.318
at the time he was assigned
to a precinct in the Bronx.

31:13.320 --> 31:17.356
Could be he was assigned
to a multi-borough task force.

31:17.358 --> 31:19.358
Maybe the paperwork
went missing.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.660
Or he has a habit
of getting into trouble

31:21.662 --> 31:24.096
and hiding behind his badge.

31:25.164 --> 31:27.432
Let's see if there's
an explanation.

31:31.137 --> 31:32.604
That's weird.

31:32.606 --> 31:33.605
The server must be down.

31:33.607 --> 31:35.273
Are you sure?
It was just working.

31:37.410 --> 31:39.277
It's not working now.

31:40.213 --> 31:41.980
<i>I built a car</i>

31:41.982 --> 31:44.049
with my brother
last summer.

31:44.051 --> 31:45.784
So what?

31:45.786 --> 31:48.787
What's a '67 Stingray gotta do
with a terrorist attack?

31:48.789 --> 31:51.490
Nothing, but it means
you're good with your hands.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.425
You know how to weld,
how to solder,

31:53.427 --> 31:55.193
how to assemble
complicated machinery.

31:55.195 --> 31:58.397
Me and every other
electrician, mechanic

31:58.399 --> 32:01.233
and I.T. guy in the city.

32:01.235 --> 32:03.001
Oh, excuse me.

32:08.608 --> 32:10.409
What's up?

32:10.411 --> 32:12.477
There's a question you might
want to ask Officer O'Grady

32:12.479 --> 32:14.513
regarding a shooting in 2012.

32:14.515 --> 32:15.226
What's the angle?

32:15.250 --> 32:17.050
To be honest,
I'm not quite sure.

32:17.051 --> 32:19.217
I thought you might be able
to do some digging of your own.

32:19.219 --> 32:20.326
We can't seem to get
into the system.

32:20.350 --> 32:21.487
Why is that?

32:21.488 --> 32:23.422
It's just not working.

32:28.361 --> 32:30.395
Hold on.

32:30.397 --> 32:32.698
I gotta check on something.

32:50.283 --> 32:52.651
I'm gonna have to call you back.

32:54.253 --> 32:55.687
Hey, Doc?

32:55.689 --> 32:57.522
Did you guys take our servers

32:57.524 --> 32:59.458
for decontamination
or something?

32:59.460 --> 33:01.426
Yeah, Bob took those
downstairs.

33:01.428 --> 33:03.762
Wait, what? No, I didn't.

33:03.764 --> 33:06.798
Really? It was like
ten minutes ago.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.534
The rest of us were here
wrapping up the tularemia test.

33:09.536 --> 33:10.969
I saw one of our people leave

33:10.971 --> 33:12.804
with a cart
full of server towers.

33:12.806 --> 33:14.506
It was a guy in
a Hazmat suit.

33:14.508 --> 33:16.108
I figured it was you.

33:16.110 --> 33:18.810
No. No, I was treating the, uh,
sick guy down the hall.

33:18.812 --> 33:20.378
The one with
the crutches.

33:20.380 --> 33:22.614
But I didn't touch
any computer stuff.

33:22.616 --> 33:24.049
Hey, Peggy?

33:24.051 --> 33:26.184
Did any of our people
bring down a bunch of

33:26.186 --> 33:28.653
server towers in the
past 20 minutes?

33:28.655 --> 33:31.490
Negative.
Nothing like that down here.

33:31.492 --> 33:34.793
Somebody in a white suit--
one of your suits--

33:34.795 --> 33:37.028
carted away
our network machines,

33:37.030 --> 33:39.498
and you don't know who they are
or where they went?

33:39.500 --> 33:42.334
I'm sure they'll turn up
once this whole thing is over.

33:42.336 --> 33:43.969
That isn't good enough.

33:43.971 --> 33:45.771
Is this really a
priority right now?

33:45.773 --> 33:47.839
We're just talking about some
computer equipment, right?

33:47.841 --> 33:49.007
No.

33:49.009 --> 33:51.109
We're talking about copies

33:51.111 --> 33:53.178
of all of the department's data.

33:53.180 --> 33:54.412
Case files,

33:54.414 --> 33:56.414
identities
of undercovers,

33:56.416 --> 33:57.816
CIs,

33:57.818 --> 34:00.318
information on...

34:00.320 --> 34:03.188
drug cartels.

34:03.190 --> 34:05.056
Captain?

34:05.058 --> 34:07.559
Servers.

34:07.561 --> 34:10.695
They'd be worth millions
to the right buyer.

34:10.697 --> 34:13.063
Maybe tens of millions.

34:13.065 --> 34:16.835
If someone came in here
and took our networks,

34:16.837 --> 34:19.471
I don't think this was
a terrorist attack

34:19.473 --> 34:20.871
after all.

34:20.873 --> 34:23.574
I think this was a heist.

34:28.572 --> 34:30.659
What you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.159
How could anyone
from our agency

34:32.161 --> 34:34.614
be responsible
for an attack that happened

34:34.616 --> 34:36.283
30 minutes before
we showed up?

34:36.928 --> 34:39.395
Somebody walked out of here
with all our servers.

34:39.397 --> 34:41.664
They were wearing a CDC suit,

34:41.666 --> 34:44.766
and they were carrying
a CDC I.D. card.

34:44.768 --> 34:48.137
They were also pretty familiar
with bioterrorism protocols.

34:48.139 --> 34:51.072
Call me crazy, but look at it
from my side of the desk.

34:51.074 --> 34:52.308
We didn't do this.

34:52.310 --> 34:53.909
Nobody in this room
even could have.

34:53.911 --> 34:55.411
What do you mean?

34:55.413 --> 34:58.480
My team's been in Botswana
conducting research for months.

34:58.482 --> 35:00.716
We only got back
two weeks ago.

35:00.718 --> 35:02.685
Do you have any idea
how long it takes

35:02.687 --> 35:04.553
to cultivate most bioagents?

35:04.555 --> 35:06.922
I don't, but do we have
any reason to believe

35:06.924 --> 35:09.291
that gas even contained
a real bioagent?

35:09.293 --> 35:11.360
What?

35:11.362 --> 35:12.828
All the evidence points
to the attacker

35:12.830 --> 35:14.697
staying on the floor
when the device went off.

35:14.699 --> 35:16.665
We've been thinking it was
because he was willing

35:16.667 --> 35:18.567
to die for his cause,
whatever that was,

35:18.569 --> 35:21.403
but if the cause
was just stealing our files,

35:21.405 --> 35:24.974
why use real germs
when you could use fake ones?

35:24.976 --> 35:27.643
The building was gonna
get quarantined either way.

35:27.645 --> 35:29.645
All your protocols
would've kicked in

35:29.647 --> 35:32.114
even if there was nothing
contagious in that canister.

35:32.116 --> 35:34.216
Do you even know
what's in it yet?

35:34.218 --> 35:37.286
I told you, the only way
to identify a substance

35:37.288 --> 35:39.288
is process of elimination.

35:39.290 --> 35:41.624
We test one by one.

35:41.626 --> 35:43.392
We can't rule out
every pathogen yet.

35:43.394 --> 35:46.462
But we have gone through
a pretty long list.

35:46.464 --> 35:48.597
To be honest,

35:48.599 --> 35:50.599
we'd usually know by now.

35:50.601 --> 35:54.069
It could just be bread mold
or something innocuous.

35:54.071 --> 35:56.171
It's not as if we
test for that first.

35:56.173 --> 35:58.040
Okay, say it is a hoax.

35:58.042 --> 36:00.175
If there was nothing
in that gas,

36:00.177 --> 36:02.077
what does that say
about the two guys

36:02.079 --> 36:04.446
who started
showing symptoms?

36:07.283 --> 36:09.385
You think they were faking?

36:09.387 --> 36:12.388
If they were,
and if O'Grady is involved,

36:12.390 --> 36:14.323
there'd have to
be some link

36:14.325 --> 36:16.659
between the three
of them, right?

36:24.801 --> 36:26.669
Hey.

36:26.671 --> 36:28.904
They ain't wearing masks.

36:30.173 --> 36:31.674
What's going on?

36:31.676 --> 36:33.375
Is it over?

36:33.377 --> 36:35.477
It is for you.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.516
Sean.

36:40.518 --> 36:42.651
Mr. Daniels,
Mr. Wong.

36:42.653 --> 36:44.286
Please, everybody, take a seat.

36:44.288 --> 36:46.188
I'd introduce you, but...

36:46.190 --> 36:48.290
you all know each other already,

36:48.292 --> 36:49.458
don't you?

36:49.460 --> 36:50.759
You're an
interesting group.

36:50.761 --> 36:52.194
Not immediately clear
how the three of you

36:52.196 --> 36:53.162
linked up to work together.

36:53.164 --> 36:54.463
There's no obvious
connection

36:54.465 --> 36:56.799
in your, uh, CVs or
your social media,

36:56.801 --> 36:59.068
but there is a common
thread that unites you,

36:59.070 --> 37:00.469
and that is bankruptcy.

37:00.471 --> 37:02.304
When we looked
at your financials,

37:02.306 --> 37:06.475
we found out that you all knew
Milan Jokic, the Repo Man.

37:06.477 --> 37:08.343
So each of you
had some property

37:08.345 --> 37:10.979
repossessed
by his company this year.

37:10.981 --> 37:12.948
Jokic knew of your dire
financial straits

37:12.950 --> 37:15.484
and offered each of you
a life raft.

37:15.486 --> 37:16.985
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:16.987 --> 37:18.787
You think I'd take money
to kill cops?

37:18.789 --> 37:22.024
Nope. No one was going to die
in Mr. Jokic's plan.

37:22.026 --> 37:23.492
The gas attack was a hoax.

37:23.494 --> 37:25.894
But it did allow him
to steal the NYPD's

37:25.896 --> 37:28.397
most valuable resource,
and that is information.

37:28.399 --> 37:31.166
Who do you think he was gonna
sell our data to, Sean?

37:31.168 --> 37:32.701
I met a cartel kingpin

37:32.703 --> 37:35.437
earlier today
who'd be very interested.

37:35.439 --> 37:37.206
Good people
were gonna end up getting hurt

37:37.208 --> 37:38.774
because of what
you did here today.

37:38.776 --> 37:42.111
CIs, witnesses, and yes, cops.

37:42.113 --> 37:45.214
I still don't know
what you're talking about.

37:45.216 --> 37:46.682
Maybe I'm slow.

37:46.684 --> 37:47.916
No, you're not slow.

37:47.918 --> 37:49.551
You were the inside man.

37:49.553 --> 37:52.287
<i>Two months ago, you took</i>
<i>photographs of the station</i>

37:52.289 --> 37:55.891
for Jokic, so he could get
a lay of the land.

37:55.893 --> 37:58.227
Jokic studied biochemistry
and engineering

37:58.229 --> 37:59.595
in his native Serbia.

37:59.597 --> 38:01.396
He had the skills to pull off

38:01.398 --> 38:04.733
a pretty convincing forgery
of a bioterror device.

38:04.735 --> 38:08.904
He just couldn't risk bringing
it into the station himself.

38:08.906 --> 38:10.305
Mr. Wong, you came here to offer

38:10.307 --> 38:11.907
phony information
on a Missing Persons case.

38:11.909 --> 38:13.075
And, Mr. Daniels,

38:13.077 --> 38:14.977
you had some
made-up story

38:14.979 --> 38:16.345
about your apartment
being burglarized.

38:16.347 --> 38:18.080
<i>But really,</i>
<i>you were smuggling pieces</i>

38:18.082 --> 38:19.581
<i>of the device</i>
<i>through the metal detectors.</i>

38:19.583 --> 38:21.517
<i>Once it went off,</i>

38:21.519 --> 38:23.285
you faked symptoms
in order to spread panic

38:23.287 --> 38:25.487
<i>and assure that the CDC</i>
<i>protocols would be</i>

38:25.489 --> 38:26.688
followed for hours.

38:26.690 --> 38:28.323
That set the stage
for the Repo Man.

38:28.325 --> 38:29.825
<i>He had a Hazmat suit</i>
<i>and a badge,</i>

38:29.827 --> 38:32.261
<i>thanks to a CDC worker</i>
<i>with gambling debts.</i>

38:32.263 --> 38:34.062
<i>Everyone was so preoccupied</i>
<i>with the business</i>

38:34.064 --> 38:36.331
<i>of the quarantine</i>
<i>that no one noticed the new guy</i>

38:36.333 --> 38:38.534
<i>walking away</i>
<i>with all the computers.</i>

38:38.536 --> 38:40.102
Your plan was to sell
the information

38:40.104 --> 38:42.271
to the highest bidder,
and then flee the country.

38:42.273 --> 38:44.840
The plane tickets on each
of your credit card statements

38:44.842 --> 38:46.275
show us as much.

38:46.277 --> 38:48.277
That's a hell of a story.

38:48.279 --> 38:50.078
Yeah, well,
it's nonfiction.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.181
Our friends at the two-four

38:52.183 --> 38:54.616
arrested Milan Jokic
an hour ago,

38:54.618 --> 38:56.785
and they found the stolen
server towers in his garage.

38:56.787 --> 38:58.854
He was happy
to offer testimony

38:58.856 --> 39:03.058
about your little plot
for a few points with the D.A.

39:03.060 --> 39:05.594
So, I hope you
enjoyed today, gentlemen,

39:05.596 --> 39:06.929
'cause there are
plenty more lockdowns

39:06.931 --> 39:08.897
in all of your near futures.

39:17.006 --> 39:18.640
Mom.

39:19.709 --> 39:22.244
You're right on time.

39:22.246 --> 39:23.912
Don't look so surprised.

39:23.914 --> 39:26.415
I have more good days than bad.

39:30.820 --> 39:32.487
This is kukicha.

39:32.489 --> 39:36.225
It's a Japanese tea made
from stems and twigs.

39:36.227 --> 39:38.560
Sherlock swears by it.

39:38.562 --> 39:40.128
Joan.

39:40.130 --> 39:42.130
You didn't bring me
all the way over here

39:42.132 --> 39:43.866
to talk about tea.

39:47.637 --> 39:50.005
You know that I love you.

39:50.007 --> 39:52.941
So...

39:52.943 --> 39:57.346
if what I'm about to say
is going to make you angry,

39:57.348 --> 39:59.948
I just want you
to remember that.

40:05.021 --> 40:06.855
I think it's time
that you consider...

40:06.857 --> 40:09.124
My Alzheimer's
has reached a point

40:09.126 --> 40:12.794
where I need to hire
a professional nurse.

40:12.796 --> 40:14.897
It's time.

40:14.899 --> 40:17.232
I've known it
for a while.

40:17.234 --> 40:19.067
And, um...

40:19.069 --> 40:22.204
yesterday, getting so mixed up,

40:22.206 --> 40:25.073
that kind of decided things.

40:26.276 --> 40:30.979
Your father and I
have called a nursing agency.

40:30.981 --> 40:32.247
We're going to start
interviewing

40:32.249 --> 40:34.283
candidates tomorrow.

40:36.352 --> 40:38.487
How do you feel about it?

40:39.389 --> 40:42.858
I guess I feel...

40:42.860 --> 40:44.860
proud.

40:44.862 --> 40:48.063
I know I'm doing
the right thing for me,

40:48.065 --> 40:50.465
and for you and Henry.

40:50.467 --> 40:54.236
And I am proud, too,
to have a daughter like you

40:54.238 --> 40:57.172
who cares enough
about me

40:57.174 --> 41:00.242
to have such a hard
conversation.

41:00.244 --> 41:03.345

41:03.347 --> 41:08.150

41:37.514 --> 41:40.048
I was sad to hear
Fratello's closed.

41:40.050 --> 41:42.851
I mean, I guess I was sad
to hear it again.

41:42.853 --> 41:45.053
But there must be

41:45.055 --> 41:49.524
some other place near here
