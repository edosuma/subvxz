Thank you for coming. Hi.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.609
Hmm.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.727
- How many at DiNova's?
- Two. Including Mr. Finch.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.362
- Al Finch?
- Mm-hmm.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.142
Huh, he was at the poker
game the other night.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.798
Oh, yeah? How much
did he take you for?

02:46.901 --> 02:48.500
What makes you think I lost?

02:48.602 --> 02:50.936
Uh, because you played, Randy.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.471
Come on, how much? Eighty bucks?

02:52.573 --> 02:53.872
Ha! Shows all you know.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.340
Eighty-five, yeah.

How may I help you?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.419
No, ma'am.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.488
We won't have the Alicia
dolls until the 12th.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.491
Yes, I'm pretty sure DiNova's
will tell you the same thing.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.427
No, I don't have their number.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.796
Yes, I believe it's spelled.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.900
D-I-N-O-V-A.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.070

How may I help you?

No, ma'am. Not until the 12th.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.569
Uh-huh. Thank you.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.486
It's a quad copter.
Great for the indoors,

04:14.588 --> 04:16.827
but I would definitely keep
my Ming vases out of the way.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.557
They're right there
on the shelf.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.293
Connie, you've got to help me.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.028
I need a toy for my
boss's daughter.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.529
- What age?
- 7 1/2.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.032
My Little Pony Magical Princess.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.967
Twilight Sparkle. Aisle 2.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.436
- You sure she'll like it?
- You might just make partner.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.708
Oh, hi. What's your name?

04:36.810 --> 04:38.644
- Eleanor.
- Hi, Eleanor.

04:38.746 --> 04:42.047
You look like a seasoned pilot.
You want to take the controls?

04:42.149 --> 04:43.515
There you go.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.754
Ah, you're doing great.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.656
Just don't lose the luggage.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.363
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.243
My son's looking for a
skateboard for Christmas,

05:00.267 --> 05:03.235
and I heard about this one
brand, called the Hurricane.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.003
We carry the Thrasher.
You know it?

05:05.105 --> 05:06.571
Oh, it's a great board.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.040
Um...

05:08.142 --> 05:11.176
would Forrester's
have the Hurricane?

05:11.278 --> 05:13.712
They might. Let's find out.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.914
Just make you get a
top-of-the-line helmet

05:16.016 --> 05:18.317
to go with it, then your
boy should be fine.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.986
Why would I need a
top-of-the-line helmet?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.422
Min, where do we keep that
number for Forrester's?

05:23.524 --> 05:26.258
Why would I need a
top-of-the-line helmet?

05:26.360 --> 05:28.460
Well, I'm sure you heard
about the recall.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.095
I got it, Min. We're good.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.330
What recall?

05:31.432 --> 05:32.931
- Hmm?
- What recall?

05:33.033 --> 05:35.567
Oh, sometimes the wheels
fly off at high speed.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.969
No big deal. Hello,
Forrester's...?

05:38.072 --> 05:39.971
Uh, hold it.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.807
Tell me more about the Thrasher.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.312
Pie Face.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.314
Is this a game I could
play with my family?

05:49.416 --> 05:51.650
I've never met your
family, ma'am.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.118
Randy, I'll take this.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.920
Actually, Pie Face is
a great family game,

05:55.022 --> 05:56.533
and the more people that
play it, the better.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.797
But are the rules complicated?

05:57.891 --> 05:59.624
No, ma'am not at all.
Very simple.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.738
Just don't forget to pick up
whipped cream on your way home.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.795
[laughs]

06:03.897 --> 06:05.831
She was asking good
questions, huh?

06:05.933 --> 06:07.899
Greg, if you're thinking about

06:08.001 --> 06:09.668
getting that for your grandson,

06:09.770 --> 06:11.181
you already got him the same
truck for his birthday.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.071
- I did?
- Same color and everything.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.740
Any other ideas?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.308
Three words: LED hand spinner.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.477
Aisle 5.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.312
- He will not be bored.
- Thanks.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.847
[chuckles]

06:27.254 --> 06:28.954
Hey, sweetie. How was school?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.356
- Okay.
- Not very convincing, kiddo.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.925
Can you hand me that
penguin, please?

06:34.027 --> 06:36.695
- What's up?
- Marshall Booter.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.965
He says he's sure his bobsled's
going to win this year.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.867
- And what do you say?
- That he's right.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.069
It wins every year.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.904
Do I have to remind you

06:46.006 --> 06:47.906
that the Cubs won the
World Series last year?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.775
So anything can happen.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.376
Shark.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.512
- Greetings and salutations.
- Hi, Nana.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.547
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.009
How was the crowd
over at DiNova's?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.952
- No comment.
- Mom!

07:01.054 --> 07:03.622
Connie, I refuse to feed

07:03.724 --> 07:06.191
this ridiculous
obsession of yours.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.527
You're not feeding it.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.562
You're just snacking
between meals.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.231
Come on, talk to me.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.767
Maybe half this size.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.068
Yes!

07:17.171 --> 07:18.470
Can I get an amen?

07:18.572 --> 07:20.672
That is not very neighborly.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.441
Don't encourage her.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.503
Hey, listen, I have been
swamped with the store.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.322
I don't think I'll be able
to cook dinner tonight.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.879
I can't either.
Takeout from Joe's?

07:27.981 --> 07:29.614
Perfect.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.616
Roast beef and mash?

07:31.718 --> 07:33.318
With extra gravy. And pecan pie.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.754
Forget the pie, kiddo.
We've got ice cream.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.522
And remember, we
are on a budget.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.257
Okay, I'm on it.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.021
You want to throw your stuff
in the back and help me?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.000
Four letters.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.769
A watery conveyance.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.804
Ends with a K.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.372
- Bark.
- [chuckles]

07:54.475 --> 07:57.142
That's what my dog said.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.211
It's also a boat.

07:59.313 --> 08:03.515
Hath not their bark
been very slow in sail.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.554
Mr. Shakespeare.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.323
Hey, it fits.

08:11.425 --> 08:12.624
Yeah.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.192
You go to Harvard or something?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.495
Morristown High.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.030
You don't need Harvard, Ed.
You just need a library card.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.767
I am late.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.803
I will see you later, Joe.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.174
Okay, pal.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.910
- Oh, hey, Pam.
- Hi, Ed.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.113
- Have a good night.
- Have a nice evening.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.948
- Good evening, Pam.
- Hello, Joe.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.751
My, what do we have here?

08:39.852 --> 08:43.889
Three turkey specials, one
roast beef and gravy.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.757
Sounds good to me.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.960
Francine, we're going to need
four slices of pecan pie.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.096
Coming right up.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.999
Oh, Joe, we didn't
order the pie.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.234
Compliments of the chef, me.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.103
Oh, you don't have to do that.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.672
I changed the recipe. I want
to hear what you think.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.974
Unless, of course, you hate it.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.543
Then don't tell me.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.878
That's not likely.
Thank you very much.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.916
Let me ask you a question.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.028
Are you still giving
those piano lessons

09:12.052 --> 09:13.118
out of your house?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.486
Every day. Why?

09:16.323 --> 09:17.789
You got room for
another student?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.659
Grandchild?

09:21.795 --> 09:22.928
Not quite.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.763
This one is 68 years old,

09:24.865 --> 09:26.731
but he's very eager to learn.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.000
What do you think?
Am I too late?

09:30.337 --> 09:31.736
Well, it's never too late.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.805
But why the sudden interest?

09:36.009 --> 09:38.243
Uh, it's my niece.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.744
Your niece.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.646
Yeah, my niece Tilly, actually.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.583
She's getting married in six
weeks down in Baltimore.

09:44.685 --> 09:48.820
I'd like to be able to play the
Wedding March at her ceremony.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.589
Six weeks?

09:50.691 --> 09:53.491
Doesn't leave us
much time, does it?

09:53.594 --> 09:56.595
Is it impossible?

09:58.565 --> 10:00.665
Not if you work hard.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.200
So that means it's impossible.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.868
- [laughs]
- I was afraid of that.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.404
Kidding. When do we start?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.741
Call me. Thanks, Francine.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.276
Say hi to Randy for me.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.345
- All right, darling.
- Bye.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.780
- Good night, you two.
- Bye-bye.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.849
- I will call you.
- Okay.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.122
- Hello, house.
- Mm, smells good.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.391
Well, let's hope it
tastes good too,

10:26.493 --> 10:28.453
because this will be our
last takeout for a while.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.629
Listen, sis, if
money's a problem,

10:30.731 --> 10:35.066
I just got invited to a poker
game at Lou Gallano's place.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.913
No, Randy. No more poker, please.
I beg you.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.504
- How come?
- Um, because...

10:39.606 --> 10:41.966
I forgot the most delicate way to say this.
You stink at it.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.209
Connie, if I am so bad at poker,

10:44.311 --> 10:46.444
how come everybody in town
wants to play it with me?

10:46.546 --> 10:47.846
Here we go.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.250
Pecan pie? Mom!

10:52.352 --> 10:54.452
He didn't charge us for it.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.121
Small mercies.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.257
Still worried about
your loan payment?

10:59.359 --> 11:02.193
Oh, no more than Dorothy was
worried about the Wicked Witch.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.195
Connie, level with me.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.997
Well, if business stays brisk

11:06.099 --> 11:08.199
and the bank extends
my loan deadline,

11:08.301 --> 11:09.701
then we'll be okay.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.436
But it wouldn't hurt
if DiNova's would

11:11.538 --> 11:12.982
pull up stakes and move
to Alaska this month.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.372
But I'm not counting on that.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.074
Teej, dinner.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.743
Turn of the TV and
go wash your hands.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.479
<i>Hey, kids, what store has
all your favorite toys</i>

11:21.581 --> 11:22.881
<i>for Christmas this year?</i>

11:22.983 --> 11:24.649
<i>Roy's!</i>

11:24.751 --> 11:26.618
<i>- I can't hear you.
- Roy's!</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:28.331
<i>- Still can't hear you.</i>
- Honey, what...?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.855
<i>- Roy's!
- Why are you whispering?</i>

11:30.957 --> 11:33.692
<i>You have your earmuffs on.</i>

11:33.794 --> 11:34.926
<i>Oh. I knew that.</i>

11:35.028 --> 11:36.394
<i>[all laugh]</i>

11:36.496 --> 11:37.962
male announcer: <i>Roy's Toys.</i>

11:38.065 --> 11:40.165
<i>Largest selection
in New England.</i>

11:40.267 --> 11:42.300
<i>And pre-order the new
Princess Alicia doll</i>

11:42.402 --> 11:46.271
<i>from the hit movi</i> e Moonglow,
<i>on sale December 12th.</i>

11:46.373 --> 11:48.506
Nervous, Mom?

11:48.608 --> 11:50.942
The nearest Roy's
is in Hartford.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.377
You know that, honey.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.778
Go wash your hands.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.152
How many times am I going to
have to buy this house, Ben?

12:01.254 --> 12:03.621
So, what made you sell
it in the first place?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.356
Equal distribution of assets.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.225
I didn't have a choice.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.627
But now I want it back.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.896
I need it back.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.264
I miss it.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.501
What about Laura? Do
you miss her too?

12:16.603 --> 12:19.070
Ha! What am I saying? Of
course you miss her too.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.106
She's as beautiful as
she was brilliant.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.340
She's as funny as she was...

12:22.442 --> 12:23.775
Yeah, I get it, Ben.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.376
But this was my family home.

12:25.479 --> 12:26.711
I grew up here.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.179
That's right.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.048
Well, even for a
part-time mayor,

12:30.150 --> 12:31.950
that was very impolitic
of me to say.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.885
I'm sorry, Will.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.555
So, how much to move in?

12:37.657 --> 12:39.617
Well, I would wave my
commission fee, of course,

12:39.693 --> 12:42.360
but the bank's going to want
at least $80,000 upfront.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.429
- $80,000?
- Yeah.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.299
All right, well...

12:48.401 --> 12:50.546
that just means I'm gonna have
to have an awesome December.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.903
That's all.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.942
Oh, my daughter loves this song.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.577
It's from a movie.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.412
<i>- Moonglow.</i>
<i>- Moonglow.</i> Yes.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.648
- Do you carry the doll?
- Oh, not until next week.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.383
But if you pre-order the doll,

13:05.485 --> 13:06.925
we will guarantee
it by next Tuesday.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.720
- Great.
- Ho, ho, ho.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.789
What would you like for
Christmas this year?

13:10.891 --> 13:12.924
[gasps] A what?

13:14.261 --> 13:15.693
A mermaid? All right.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.695
Well, I'll see if I
can talk to your mom

13:17.798 --> 13:19.464
about a little fishy then.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.943
Just ring your bell
on Christmas Eve,

13:20.967 --> 13:22.534
and I'll come visit you.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.769
All right, come over
here and see Santa.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.304
Now, what is your name?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.806
Angelica.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.008
Angelica, what a beautiful name.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.144
What would you like for
Christmas this year, huh?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.215
A kitten?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.750
I think we can
probably do a kitten,

13:38.852 --> 13:40.685
if I put in a good
word with your mom.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.987
We'll see, all right?
So here's a bell.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.723
And ring it on Christmas Eve,
and I'll see what I can do.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.493
Okay. All right,
buddy, hop aboard.

13:48.595 --> 13:52.230
Oh! Now, what would you like
for Christmas this year?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.566
A recorder?

13:54.668 --> 13:56.935
Oh, you're a music man, huh?

13:57.037 --> 13:59.771
Well, here's a little bell.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.173
And on Christmas Eve, I
want you to ring that.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.053
And I'm going to try to
bring a recorder your way.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.811
Now you be real good. All right.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.147
Oh. Hey, Francine.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.548
What are you doing here?

14:10.650 --> 14:12.050
Randy, you asked
me that last week

14:12.085 --> 14:13.565
when you bumped into
me at the movies,

14:13.653 --> 14:15.231
and the week before that
at the bowling alley.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.756
Oh, well, I guess I'm
just a curious guy.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.860
Well, here. Merry Christmas.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.462
- Oh.
- All right.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.700
All right there.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.668
Hey, what's your name?

14:30.770 --> 14:32.114
Okay, well, we will
see you on the 12th.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.905
Can I help you find
anything else?

14:34.007 --> 14:35.718
Thanks. I think I'm just
going to keep browsing.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.175
Okay.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.344
Hey, how's DiNova's
up the street?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.779
I cannot say enough about it.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.448
- [laughs]
- Thanks.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.951
Because it drives me crazy.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.654
And the...

14:49.756 --> 14:54.626
♪ itsy-bitsy spider ♪

14:56.696 --> 15:00.965
♪ Climbed up the spout again ♪

15:01.067 --> 15:02.267
Hey.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.668
Okay, that was better, Joe.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.370
But remember, G-flat is here.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.772
Yeah, sorry, I got a
little distracted there.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.674
I was worried about the spider.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.010
Yes, he certainly was in a
bit of a pickle, wasn't he?

15:12.112 --> 15:15.480
Yeah, but then sun comes
out, dries everything all...

15:15.582 --> 15:16.981
Everything's normal again.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.717
Yeah, it's pretty
convenient if you ask me.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.086
- Lazy, you mean.
- Yeah.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.733
Like they'd rather just
want to wrap everything up

15:23.757 --> 15:25.189
and get out of there, you know?

15:25.292 --> 15:26.991
Well, maybe he had to
go to the bathroom.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.761
Maybe. I'm sure all that
talk about the rainfall

15:29.863 --> 15:31.629
probably didn't help, huh?

15:31.731 --> 15:33.364
[both laugh]

15:33.466 --> 15:35.226
Don't make me laugh
when I'm drinking, Joe.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.201
Pianos are expensive.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.804
- I promise.
- By the way,

15:39.906 --> 15:42.473
what kind of piano are you
practicing on at home?

15:42.575 --> 15:45.243
I bought this...
this little Brite.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.278
You know, it's cheap.
On Craigslist.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.391
I don't know what it was called.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.281
It was 60 bucks.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.261
Just remember, you need to
practice two hours a day

15:52.285 --> 15:53.930
if you want to be ready for
your niece Tilly's wedding.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.320
- Yeah.
- Okay?

15:55.422 --> 15:56.854
- Sure.
- All right, from the top.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.590
From the top. From the top.

15:59.693 --> 16:04.095
♪ The itsy-bitsy spider ♪

16:04.197 --> 16:08.633
♪ Went up the garden spout ♪

16:11.705 --> 16:13.972
- You got to buy this too?
- Why do I have to buy that?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.551
Because it's open and
I'm drinking it.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.141
Speaking of theft, Randy,

16:17.243 --> 16:19.744
I noticed some missing
inventory again.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.579
I think I have a
shoplifter on my hands.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.514
Okay, here's what you do.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.649
Four guys, undercover.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.117
- Four?
- Yeah.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.952
Like one for each
corner of the store.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.988
- Preferably ex-Navy SEALs.
- Navy SEALs, got it.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.468
Shoplifter comes in for the
five-finger discount, and boom.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.692
You take them out
like the A-Team.

16:34.794 --> 16:35.972
Okay, you're proposing I spend

16:35.996 --> 16:37.006
tens of thousands of dollars

16:37.030 --> 16:38.830
to catch a Play-Doh thief.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.566
Okay, two guys, ex-FBI.
Now the thing here is...

16:41.668 --> 16:43.913
Randy, how about we just get
some security cameras, okay?

16:43.937 --> 16:45.536
They're 30 bucks, over there.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.271
- We can do that.
- Yeah.

16:49.976 --> 16:53.478
Oh, dude, business
is booming, Jake!

16:53.580 --> 16:54.846
[laughs]

16:54.948 --> 16:56.447
I had to hire three more people

16:56.549 --> 16:57.860
just to keep up with
traffic this week.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.917
I can't... Oh, hey, Forrester.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.352
How's it going?

17:01.454 --> 17:02.854
Hey, Jake, listen,
man, I got to go.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.454
But let's have
dinner soon, okay?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.057
On me this time.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.059
Merry Christmas.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.961
My buddy Jake.

17:10.063 --> 17:14.098
So sounds like things are
going good for you, huh?

17:14.200 --> 17:18.368
What? Oh, man, don't tell
me you just overheard that.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.371
Okay, now I'm embarrassed.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.473
[laughs]

17:21.508 --> 17:23.074
Well, you should be,

17:23.175 --> 17:25.810
because there is no
cell service in here.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.345
I'm sorry?

17:27.446 --> 17:30.448
Yeah, this whole block
is a dead zone.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.351
Oh, really?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.219
Well, then who was
I just talking to?

17:35.321 --> 17:38.623
Uh, the only person who
finds you faintly amusing.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.091
Yourself.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.360
I know plenty of people

17:42.462 --> 17:43.995
who find me amusing.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.508
Oh, yeah? How is
skid row these days?

17:45.532 --> 17:48.099
Okay, that was kind of clever.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.635
<i>And, of course, we
are pleased as punch</i>

17:50.737 --> 17:52.970
<i>to be bringing our high
quality superior selection</i>

17:53.073 --> 17:54.605
<i>to this part of the state.</i>

17:54.707 --> 17:56.707
<i>Your grand opening
is on Saturday.</i>

17:56.810 --> 17:59.577
<i>How did you manage to keep
it quiet for so long?</i>

17:59.679 --> 18:01.646
<i>It wasn't easy, believe me.</i>

18:01.748 --> 18:04.015
<i>Back to you, David.</i>

18:05.285 --> 18:06.751
How could this have
happened, Ben?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.820
A heads-up would
have been nice, Ben.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.766
- I was blindsided too.
- How'd he build a huge story

18:10.790 --> 18:13.124
in town without anyone
knowing about it?

18:13.226 --> 18:14.759
He didn't. He was crafty.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.694
He went through a second party.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.240
He bought the old Tower
Records just off the highway.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.498
It's been standing
empty for nine years.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.101
Well, serves us all right for
not buying more records.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.336
Ben, what are you going
to do about this?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.106
Well, naturally, Will,
I'm going to wave

18:28.208 --> 18:30.174
my enchanted mayor's
wand seven times

18:30.276 --> 18:32.343
and turn Barnes's new store into

18:32.445 --> 18:34.245
a big pile of goose feathers.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.180
- How would that be?
- Sounds good, Mayor.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.160
But I'd keep that wand under
lock and key, because if...

18:38.184 --> 18:39.317
Joking.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.252
Unsuccessfully.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.055
But maybe there is a
magic wand we can use.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.790
Come with me.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.403
You want to tell me
where you're going?

18:47.427 --> 18:50.161
Less than anything
else in the world.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.697
She does not mince words.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.773
County library? Whoa.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.720
Don't get in here much.
What are we looking for?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.511
Municipal document.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.045
I know I saw it down here once,

19:08.148 --> 19:09.558
but they have moved
everything around

19:09.582 --> 19:11.015
since I worked here
back in college.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.394
Oh, I remember when
you took that job.

19:12.418 --> 19:13.951
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.831
Dad was scared stiff you'd
wind up a librarian

19:15.855 --> 19:17.822
instead of going into
business with him.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.828
Sis, you know I'm
not bitter, right?

19:23.930 --> 19:25.763
About Dad leaving
the store to you

19:25.865 --> 19:27.398
instead of the both of us?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.268
Well, I hope not, Randy.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.448
I mean, I was there when you
told him you'd rather spend

19:32.472 --> 19:34.972
50 years in the Sahara than
one hour in the toy business.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.475
Boy, sure took that
literally, didn't he?

19:37.577 --> 19:39.076
[laughs]

19:39.179 --> 19:41.979
But, well, I guess
it makes sense.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.183
I mean, you love the
store as much as he did,

19:45.285 --> 19:47.451
and I love crewing
on fishing boats

19:47.554 --> 19:50.655
and giving you a hand in
the off-season, but...

19:50.757 --> 19:52.223
But?

19:52.325 --> 19:53.357
[sighs]

19:53.459 --> 19:55.092
Well, it's just

19:55.195 --> 19:57.028
I wanted Dad to be proud
of me, that's all.

19:57.130 --> 19:59.497
Oh, Randy, he adored you.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.867
Well, yeah, but it's not
the same as being proud.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.338
- Ah-ha.
- What?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.443
Come on down to Roy's Toys.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.680
Roy's got everything you need
for Christmas this year.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.982
How about a driver's license?

20:18.084 --> 20:20.451
- Almost everything.
- [all laugh]

20:20.553 --> 20:22.787
And... cut.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.622
That was great.
Let's go tighter.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.724
Five minutes, everybody.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.525
Listen, Max,

20:27.627 --> 20:29.138
the kid in the black shirt
over there is walleyed.

20:29.162 --> 20:30.228
It's creeping me out.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.029
- Walleyed?
- Yeah.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.676
I'm afraid you're going
to have to replace him.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.300
- Get a normal kid in there.
- Okay, Roy.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.845
And do it quietly, under
some sort of pretext.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.336
I'll think of something.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.304
Good. Miss Halifax,
what's the good word?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.039
- Problems.
- That's a bad word.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.608
You need to see this, Roy.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.070
It's from the New
Britain location.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.664
Are they ready for
the grand opening?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.023
There may not be any
grand opening, Roy.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.146
Look.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.815
What am I looking at?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.217
County ordnance someone
dug up from 1948.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.239
Forbids the operation of
any retail establishment

20:55.288 --> 20:56.721
over a certain size.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.067
Well, what about Tower Records?

20:58.091 --> 20:59.357
It was never enforced before.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.625
Well, why pick on me?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.126
Why does Tower get
all the breaks?

21:02.228 --> 21:03.761
Roy, they're bankrupt.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.696
You're worth $2 billion.
Who got the break?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.198
They did.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.500
Okay, Roy, you're
getting hysterical.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.103
You're right. I'm in a tizzy.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.604
These things throw
me into a tizzy.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.906
I need a field estimate
of my chances.

21:16.009 --> 21:18.109
Of not being shut down if
you ignore this thing?

21:18.211 --> 21:19.310
25 to 1.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.945
Get my lawyer on the phone.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.513
- Which one?
- All of them.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.229
Okay, your little brother's
going to love this.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.986
- Merry Christmas, Brady.
- Thank you.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.489
- Paper just came.
- Oh, good.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.191
Let me check out the new coupon.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.129
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

21:38.231 --> 21:39.608
Did they forget the
little dotted line

21:39.632 --> 21:41.232
that shows you where to cut?

21:42.302 --> 21:43.567
Oh, no.

21:46.039 --> 21:47.538
I know.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.340
I know.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.108
What happened to the ordnance?

21:51.210 --> 21:53.744
Connie, it's like I told
Will DiNova just now.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.813
Barnes's attorney filed
a motion for a waiver.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.582
- Filed a motion with who?
- The Board of Selectmen.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.685
We're voting on it this month.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.453
But it has to be a
simple majority.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.121
That's the good news.

22:04.223 --> 22:06.057
And the board is only me
and two other people.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.660
Shirley Laverson who, granted,
might vote in Barnes's favor.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.228
And my brother-in-law Pete,

22:11.331 --> 22:14.632
who I just gave my
kidney to last year,

22:14.734 --> 22:16.100
who I guarantee you will not.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.768
And I'm certainly not going to.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.037
What was... What's the bad news?

22:21.374 --> 22:22.907
I beg your pardon?

22:23.009 --> 22:25.242
Well, you said there was...
That was the good news,

22:25.345 --> 22:26.711
like there was also
some bad news.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.245
What's the bad news?

22:31.918 --> 22:33.684
The vote is on Christmas Eve.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.620
Until then...

22:38.458 --> 22:39.657
[mumbles]

22:39.759 --> 22:42.626
What? Until then, what?

22:42.729 --> 22:44.829
- Barnes gets to remain open.
- No!

22:44.931 --> 22:47.164
No, that is two weeks away.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.166
That could seriously
damage my business.

22:49.268 --> 22:52.203
I know. Will DiNova has
a lot to lose too.

22:52.305 --> 22:55.072
Stop trying to cheer me up.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.274
[phone rings]

22:58.845 --> 23:00.444
Forrester Toys, where
you can pre-order

23:00.546 --> 23:02.680
the all new Princess Ali...

23:02.782 --> 23:04.415
DiNova?

23:07.453 --> 23:10.221
Well, good morning, Connie.
Do you need a menu?

23:10.323 --> 23:12.823
Oh, no, thanks, Joe.
I'm not staying.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.826
Well, how about a referee then?

23:18.664 --> 23:20.731
Toll House cookies.
Help yourself.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.167
What is a toll
house anyway, huh?

23:24.704 --> 23:26.215
Is that why you asked
me to come down here?

23:26.239 --> 23:27.605
To ask me that?

23:27.707 --> 23:29.740
No. You going to sit?

23:34.480 --> 23:35.646
Got a proposal for you.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.348
You're not my type.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.417
Forrester, my deal will
go a whole lot better

23:39.519 --> 23:40.951
if I don't have to
fight with you.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.553
Mine won't.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.188
All right, look,

23:44.290 --> 23:46.824
I know we have a little
history together.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.259
Your dad resented my uncle

23:48.361 --> 23:50.428
for buying his own
store up the street,

23:50.530 --> 23:52.241
and you resented me for taking it over.
I get it.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.625
Is this going to
be a long story?

23:53.699 --> 23:55.533
No, I'll cut right to the end.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.568
- We're drowning.
- I'm not.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.203
Give me a break.

23:59.305 --> 24:01.105
We're in the same leaky
boat, and you know it.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.207
Oh, a second ago
we were drowning.

24:03.309 --> 24:04.989
So I mixed my metaphors a little.
Sue me.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.911
The point is, there's
trouble in River City,

24:07.013 --> 24:09.346
and his name is Roy Barnes.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.981
I am well aware of Roy Barnes.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.350
What is it you want exactly?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.954
An alliance. You and me.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.322
I'm sorry?

24:18.424 --> 24:19.690
Strictly of convenience,

24:19.792 --> 24:21.759
and only for two weeks.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.662
You mean like working together?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.342
Why not? I feel
like Bugs and Daffy

24:27.366 --> 24:28.606
teaming up to fight Elmer Fudd.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.034
It happened all the time.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.636
Bugs never teamed up with Daffy.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.972
What? You're cra...
You want a list?

24:35.074 --> 24:36.807
"Rabbit Fire," 1951.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.409
"Rabbit Seasoning," 1952.

24:38.511 --> 24:39.755
- "Rabbit..."
- You know what, DiNova?

24:39.779 --> 24:41.412
I don't care.

24:41.514 --> 24:44.715
All I'm saying is we
pool our resources.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.484
All we got to do is
keep ourselves alive

24:46.586 --> 24:48.397
until the board votes to
reject Barnes's waiver

24:48.421 --> 24:49.687
on Christmas Eve.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.389
Then we're home free.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.757
And if they don't reject it?

24:53.860 --> 24:55.459
Well, then we're sunk anyway.

24:55.561 --> 24:58.662
But Ben assured me
they will reject it.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.232
I'm sure he told you
the same thing.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.435
So, what do you say?

25:04.537 --> 25:06.637
Temporary partners?

25:12.211 --> 25:13.978
I'm going to have
to think about it.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.613
What?

25:15.715 --> 25:17.615
Have a nice day.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.250
Are you going to let me know

25:19.352 --> 25:20.952
before his big grand
opening on Saturday?

25:20.987 --> 25:23.220
Forrester!

25:25.324 --> 25:28.259
Man, she loves these
dramatic exits.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.160
I know I do.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.830
[phone rings]

25:38.037 --> 25:39.703
Hello?

25:39.805 --> 25:41.272
Oh, hi, honey. You coming home?

25:41.374 --> 25:42.740
<i>Yeah, in a bit.</i>

25:42.842 --> 25:45.042
Mom...

25:45.144 --> 25:46.911
the sign on the store,

25:47.013 --> 25:48.879
Dad copied the design
from the café he took you

25:48.981 --> 25:50.381
on your first date, didn't he?

25:50.483 --> 25:53.250
<i>Mm-hmm. Brewed Awakenings.</i>

25:53.352 --> 25:55.052
Up in Grandville.

25:55.154 --> 25:59.123
We sat sipping coffee for
more than three hours.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.891
<i>Your dad was so nervous</i>

26:00.993 --> 26:03.227
<i>that half the sugar
ended up in his lap.</i>

26:04.864 --> 26:06.297
He was crazy about you, Mom.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.098
<i>Yes.</i>

26:08.200 --> 26:11.468
<i>He loved me, and you,
and Randy, and TJ,</i>

26:11.571 --> 26:13.170
<i>and that store.</i>

26:13.272 --> 26:15.406
That was his world.

26:15.508 --> 26:17.074
<i>Pretty great world.</i>

26:17.176 --> 26:21.078
<i>You want to tell me
what's going on?</i>

26:21.180 --> 26:22.413
Oh, nothing, Mom.

26:22.515 --> 26:23.847
It's just...

26:25.651 --> 26:26.984
I have this friend.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.588
<i>She lost her dad four years ago,</i>

26:30.690 --> 26:32.456
and her husband a year later.

26:32.558 --> 26:35.225
And now she's close to
losing her business.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.428
So she gets to wondering,

26:37.530 --> 26:40.598
what does luck have in
store for me next year?

26:42.134 --> 26:44.468
<i>Well, Connie, you
tell your friend</i>

26:44.570 --> 26:46.570
that luck can change.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.339
Especially if you make your own.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.442
Did you get that from
a fortune cookie?

26:51.510 --> 26:53.711
Doesn't mean it's not true.

26:55.781 --> 26:56.914
I love you, Mom.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.782
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

26:58.884 --> 27:00.618
I love you too, sweetheart.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.363
[phone rings]

27:13.599 --> 27:14.765
Hello?

27:14.867 --> 27:16.033
<i>DiNova?</i>

27:16.135 --> 27:17.568
I'm in.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.003
Yes! Oh, by the way,

27:19.105 --> 27:20.182
I'm Bugs in this scenario, okay?

27:20.206 --> 27:21.305
You're Daffy.

27:21.407 --> 27:22.706
[laughs] I'm just kidding.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.042
You can be Bugs if you want to.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.744
Hello?

27:28.347 --> 27:30.781
You've already hung
up, haven't you?

27:30.883 --> 27:33.884
All right, then. I... yeah,
I'm going to hang up too.

27:37.456 --> 27:40.157
You might be wondering
what it is I'm doing here,

27:40.259 --> 27:41.859
and what it is
you're doing here,

27:41.961 --> 27:45.529
employees of Forrester
Toys and DiNova Toys.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.332
Well, as of today,

27:48.434 --> 27:51.502
we few, we happy few,

27:51.604 --> 27:53.170
we band of brothers...

27:53.272 --> 27:55.339
- And sisters.
- And sisters...

27:55.441 --> 27:57.174
are co-workers.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.710
Each of our stores
is remaining open,

27:59.812 --> 28:03.414
but we're going to be pooling
our profits, our inventory,

28:03.516 --> 28:05.582
and our marketing plan.

28:05.685 --> 28:08.185
Which means we're going to
ask all of you to put aside

28:08.287 --> 28:10.888
that burning feeling of
disgust and resentment

28:10.990 --> 28:12.423
that's been haunting
your thoughts

28:12.525 --> 28:14.058
and fueling your nightmares

28:14.160 --> 28:15.726
for the last several years,

28:15.828 --> 28:18.228
and see if you can work
together as a team.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.763
Do you think you can do that?

28:19.865 --> 28:22.232
- Yeah. No problem. Easy.
- Sure.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.734
You can?

28:23.836 --> 28:25.002
We already get along great.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.737
You do?

28:26.839 --> 28:28.679
Connie, I think you might
be projecting here.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.874
I mean, all of us
really like each other.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.843
We actually hang out after work.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.223
Maureen and I have been going
out for almost a year now.

28:35.247 --> 28:39.216
And Kenny and I are thinking
of eloping next month.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.853
- Oh.
- Congratulations.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.422
Well, that was awkward.

28:45.524 --> 28:46.990
If you laugh, I'll kill you.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.828
[piano being played]

28:52.198 --> 28:53.931
Okay.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.632
That was, um...

28:57.770 --> 28:59.503
that sounded...

28:59.605 --> 29:02.306
you have been practicing
two hours a day, right?

29:02.408 --> 29:04.441
Yes, I've been practicing
two hours a day.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.810
Sometimes three hours a day.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.445
Oh. Hmm.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.714
Let me ask you a question.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.761
I've been looking at this
photograph for weeks now.

29:12.785 --> 29:16.053
One of those guys up there, he
was your husband, wasn't he?

29:16.155 --> 29:18.355
Yeah. That's Alex
on the right there.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.290
Ah. A fine-looking man.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.558
Hmm.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.894
Grand opening. Nice.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.662
Who's the other fellas?

29:25.765 --> 29:27.397
Oh, that's Roger DiNova.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.133
They were partners?

29:29.235 --> 29:31.168
Yeah, didn't you know?

29:31.270 --> 29:32.970
I only hit town a
couple of years ago.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.805
What happened?

29:34.907 --> 29:38.876
Well, Alex and Roger were
best friends in college.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.618
And about five years
after they graduated,

29:40.646 --> 29:42.246
they decided to
open a toy store.

29:42.348 --> 29:43.714
It was all Dad's idea.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.516
Connie, do you mind?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.317
I'm giving a piano lesson.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.186
Actually, you're giving
a history lesson,

29:49.288 --> 29:51.688
and I'd like for
it to be accurate.

29:51.791 --> 29:56.026
Anyway, since Alex was
the primary investor,

29:56.128 --> 30:00.097
he felt that it should be his
name on the front window.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.666
Dad sunk every last nickel
he had into that place.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.071
Roger was okay with
that at first,

30:08.174 --> 30:09.484
but as time went by
and he was working

30:09.508 --> 30:11.341
every bit as hard as Alex was...

30:11.443 --> 30:13.343
Ha!

30:14.647 --> 30:16.680
He decided that his name

30:16.782 --> 30:18.182
should be there too.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.817
And Alex refused.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.319
They fell out over it.

30:22.421 --> 30:26.056
And then Roger took out a loan
and opened his own toy store

30:26.158 --> 30:29.593
one block down the road,
mainly out of spite.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.395
Mainly?

30:31.497 --> 30:34.231
Connie, do you want to
finish telling the story?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.699
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, Mom.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.267
I love science fiction.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.238
And they never made up, huh?

30:41.340 --> 30:44.074
Funny you should ask, Joe.

30:44.176 --> 30:47.044
Hi, Pam. TJ let me in.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.213
Uh, sorry.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.582
Probably should
have called first.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.418
For what it's worth, Pam,

30:54.520 --> 30:55.853
my uncle wanted to visit Alex

30:55.955 --> 30:57.421
every day he was
in the hospital.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.122
But he refused.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.424
I know.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.426
I'm sorry, Will.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.362
Okay, let me just say
this for the record.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.764
I hate this story.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.100
Yeah, me too.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.735
So, what brings you by, DiNova?

31:11.837 --> 31:13.670
Joe, actually.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.139
Francine said you might be here.

31:16.242 --> 31:19.576
Pancake recipe for tomorrow.
The best you ever tasted.

31:19.678 --> 31:20.711
It's yours?

31:20.813 --> 31:22.713
The ex-wife's.

31:22.815 --> 31:24.893
I'm sure she's whipping up a
batch every morning these days

31:24.917 --> 31:26.817
- for Carl.
- Carl?

31:26.919 --> 31:28.385
The ex-friend.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.755
I hate all these stories.

31:31.857 --> 31:33.857
TJ, did you remember
to close the garage?

31:33.959 --> 31:35.392
No.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.495
I saw a bobsled in there.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.763
That yours, TJ?

31:39.865 --> 31:41.899
- Yeah.
- Nice.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.612
Getting ready for the
big race next weekend?

31:43.636 --> 31:45.535
Oh, you mean the one
I'm going to lose?

31:45.638 --> 31:46.870
He's been reading.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.972
<i>The Power of Positive Thinking.</i>

31:49.074 --> 31:51.975
You know, I was supposed to
lose to Mark and Frankie's sled

31:52.077 --> 31:54.978
back in 1987, but I didn't.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.414
I actually took first prize.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.650
Maybe later I could
show you how.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.385
Cool.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.436
Grand opening. This isn't
even a good opening.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.705
In two hours I've sold exactly one Mr.
Potato Head

32:21.807 --> 32:23.640
and one game of Monopoly.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.887
Actually, the Mr. Potato
Head just got returned, Roy.

32:25.911 --> 32:27.244
But they took store credit.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.846
Where is everybody?

32:34.286 --> 32:36.620
You're not going to believe it.

32:36.722 --> 32:37.921
Oh.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.762
The princess will be
here Tuesday, Mel.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.397
Hey, I am so sorry.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.010
We are out of the Chase
& Go ball popper,

32:49.034 --> 32:50.612
but I bet DiNova's up the
street will have one.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.402
If I were you I'd hurry.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.504
Reverend, how's it going?

32:54.606 --> 32:57.007
Connie, if I served these at
church, we'd fill every pew.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.308
That heavenly, huh?

32:58.410 --> 33:00.043
[laughs]

33:00.145 --> 33:02.746
Ben, looks like you could
use some more coffee.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.348
Oh, thank you, Connie.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.183
Hey, you know why they
call coffee "mud"?

33:06.285 --> 33:08.819
Uh, because it was ground
a few minutes ago?

33:08.921 --> 33:10.287
Old joke, Ben.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.724
I'm not that old.

33:23.736 --> 33:26.503
Hey, Eleanor, you having fun?

33:26.605 --> 33:29.172
Sorry. I know I'm always
playing with this toy.

33:29.274 --> 33:30.941
Oh, what do I look
like, the FAA?

33:31.043 --> 33:32.909
Knock yourself out.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.212
I really wish we could
afford to buy it.

33:35.314 --> 33:38.682
My dad says there's no money
for extras right now.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.951
Yeah, a lot of
that going around.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.394
Not bad. Not bad.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.029
Yeah, I counted 85 just now.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.398
Yeah, it was almost
70 over at my place.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.799
Well, you were right.

33:55.901 --> 33:57.112
Americans will do
just about anything

33:57.136 --> 33:58.535
for free pancakes.

33:58.637 --> 33:59.881
I think this guy's
ready to propose.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.071
Oh.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.506
[laughs]

34:08.047 --> 34:09.913
What is he doing here?

34:11.283 --> 34:14.150
So, this is where all
my customers got to.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.286
I wondered. Connie
Forrester, right?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.355
That's me.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.556
Roy Barnes. My
associate, Miss Halifax.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.759
Nice to meet you finally.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.795
And nice little shop
you've got here.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.197
Be it ever so humble.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.766
We were just in DiNova Toys.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.868
Wall to wall. Tell
him congratulations.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.870
Pancake breakfast.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.940
Hat's off, guys. Very inspired.

34:37.042 --> 34:39.342
- Mr. Barnes...
- Roy, please.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.143
Roy.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.179
I have to say, you're being
surprisingly gracious

34:43.282 --> 34:45.148
considering, well...

34:45.250 --> 34:47.650
I'm the competition?
Why the heck not?

34:47.753 --> 34:50.219
I mean, you two seem to
get along okay, right?

34:50.322 --> 34:53.123
- Peas in a pod.
- See what I mean?

34:53.225 --> 34:55.492
I just figured that's how
things are done around here.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.354
It's kind of refreshing,
right, Miss Halifax?

34:57.396 --> 34:58.829
Like a mug of hot cocoa.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.430
Or a stack of
buttermilk pancakes.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.166
Speaking of which, do
you mind if we...?

35:03.268 --> 35:05.235
Yeah, follow me.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.009
The Eliminator?

35:13.112 --> 35:15.345
So tell me, what's the
Eliminator, exactly?

35:15.447 --> 35:17.180
- Sled.
- Bobsled, Mr. H.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.648
Best one in the county.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.150
Tell him how fast
it goes, Boots.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.885
- 42.
- 42 miles an hour, Mr. H.

35:21.987 --> 35:25.122
Oh, that's not going fast.
That's flying low.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.202
Right. Hey, Boots, where
should we go to celebrate

35:27.226 --> 35:28.391
after you win next weekend?

35:28.494 --> 35:30.227
[laughs]

35:30.329 --> 35:31.706
You guys are feeling pretty
confident, aren't you?

35:31.730 --> 35:32.774
Well, who's going to beat him?

35:32.798 --> 35:34.030
Anything's possible.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.533
Cubs won the World
Series last year.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.134
[laughs]

35:37.236 --> 35:39.002
Cubs weren't facing
the Eliminator.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.375
Hey, pal, listen,

35:45.477 --> 35:47.222
I really want to see you
win next weekend, huh?

35:47.246 --> 35:48.578
Me too.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.158
How would you like a
one-man crew chief?

35:50.182 --> 35:51.681
You're hired.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.906
[drill whirring]

36:18.944 --> 36:20.310
Hey.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.932
You hear the latest
about Roy Barnes?

36:21.980 --> 36:23.580
No. Do we want to?

36:23.682 --> 36:26.149
Well, apparently now he's
a patron of the sport.

36:26.251 --> 36:27.784
What?

36:29.154 --> 36:31.054
"Toy mogul Roy Barnes
has thrown his hat

36:31.156 --> 36:32.622
"into the winter sports arena

36:32.724 --> 36:33.835
"by sponsoring Marshall
Booter's bobsled,

36:33.859 --> 36:36.560
"the Eliminator,

36:36.662 --> 36:38.806
which will be competing in the
winter carnival race Saturday."

36:38.830 --> 36:40.263
Sponsoring?

36:40.365 --> 36:41.442
Yeah, like it's
NASCAR or something.

36:41.466 --> 36:42.766
Can you believe this?

36:42.868 --> 36:45.068
- No.
- Why is he doing it?

36:45.170 --> 36:47.182
"Well, just my way of giving
back to the community,".

36:47.206 --> 36:49.906
"Barnes explained, as he stood
in front of his recently opened.

36:50.008 --> 36:51.474
New Britain store."

36:51.577 --> 36:53.188
What a pack of lies. He's
doing it to get to me.

36:53.212 --> 36:54.945
To get to us.

36:57.449 --> 37:00.250
It'll just be that much sweeter
to watch them lose next week.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.686
Hand me that screw
right there, please.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.023
I'm installing it now, sis.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.125
You'd never even
know it's a camera.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.560
Heck, you even fooled me.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.761
[laughs]

37:11.863 --> 37:13.897
Hard to believe.

37:13.999 --> 37:18.335
Right? This dude's shoplifting
days are numbered.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.270
Oh, that's great.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.205
Thanks, bro.

37:22.307 --> 37:23.707
Oh.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.542
Hold on, I got to
take this, okay?

37:25.644 --> 37:27.510
All right. Talk soon.
Bye, Randy.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.413
Hello?

37:32.884 --> 37:34.184
[sighs]

37:34.286 --> 37:35.885
This is huge. Thanks, Tess.

37:35.988 --> 37:38.154
I owe you one.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.991
Tess Howard, I helped her
ace third period algebra,

37:41.093 --> 37:42.726
and now she gives me
intel on Roy Barnes.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.127
What's up?

37:44.229 --> 37:45.729
Well, Tess works
at the warehouse

37:45.831 --> 37:47.141
where they're shipping
the Alicias from.

37:47.165 --> 37:48.932
- And?
- And...

37:49.034 --> 37:50.700
she said there is
limited production

37:50.802 --> 37:52.435
on the dolls this year.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.315
Anyone who placed their
order after October 15th

37:54.339 --> 37:56.539
won't be getting their dolls
in time for Christmas.

37:56.642 --> 37:59.242
Like Roy Barnes's new store?

37:59.344 --> 38:01.344
Like Roy Barnes's new store.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.680
Does that mean Roy
is out of luck?

38:03.782 --> 38:06.616
Up a creek without a princess.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.885
[all laugh]

38:15.961 --> 38:17.427
Hey, Roy!

38:17.529 --> 38:20.196
Neil Armstrong, Roy!

38:20.299 --> 38:22.499
Neil Armstrong!

38:22.601 --> 38:24.301
What? Neil Armstrong?

38:24.403 --> 38:26.603
Buddy, you're the
one in outer space.

38:31.243 --> 38:33.109
Randy, I noticed some
more missing inventory.

38:33.211 --> 38:35.779
I think our shoplifter
has struck again.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.380
Don't worry, sis.

38:37.482 --> 38:42.552
The gnome is in the home
and on the job 24/7.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.857
Let's take a bite out of crime.

38:51.063 --> 38:53.797
Okay, never mind
about last night.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.819
Just go to when you first
opened up this morning.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.602
Gas station, Randy.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.071
Gas station.

39:01.173 --> 39:03.406
No! I had the gnome
facing the wrong way.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.508
At the window.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.942
[sighs]

39:06.044 --> 39:07.422
You know what? It's
my fault, Randy.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.045
When I said to
monitor the store,

39:09.147 --> 39:10.847
I really should have
specified this store.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.882
Hey, hey, don't beat
yourself up, sis.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.185
I'm partly to blame here too.

39:15.287 --> 39:17.053
[phone rings]

39:18.256 --> 39:19.656
Hey, Tess. What's up?

39:21.126 --> 39:23.159
What bad news?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Will, we've got a problem.

39:31.103 --> 39:33.403
- How big?
- Think Armageddon.

39:33.505 --> 39:36.172
Uh, Sam will finish
ringing you up, ma'am.

39:36.274 --> 39:38.241
Sam, please.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.810
- What's up?
- Money changed hands.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.824
The dolls that were supposed
to be coming to us tonight,

39:42.848 --> 39:44.092
they're being
delivered to Roy's.

39:44.116 --> 39:45.615
But isn't that,

39:45.717 --> 39:48.318
oh, what's the word that
means opposite of legal?

39:48.420 --> 39:49.697
Well, if Barnes
forged the papers,

39:49.721 --> 39:50.932
it's just his word against ours.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.789
We could sue.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.291
And we would definitely win.
But I just talked to a lawyer.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.993
He said it could take
up to three years.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.606
Those are our dolls, Forrester.
We paid for them.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.096
I know. The question is,

40:00.198 --> 40:01.831
how are we going
to get them back?

40:01.933 --> 40:03.333
[sighs]

40:05.537 --> 40:07.404
How are your acting skills?

40:09.741 --> 40:11.508
Let's find out.

40:13.678 --> 40:16.179
Is this Big Al Larkin?

40:16.281 --> 40:18.481
This is Sue Dodie
calling from corporate.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.117
Yeah, listen, I just
heard from New Britain.

40:21.219 --> 40:24.287
Uh, what's going on out there?
I mean, you lost or something?

40:24.389 --> 40:25.749
What are you talking
about, lost?

40:25.791 --> 40:27.223
I'm on Route 7 now.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.325
Oh, no, you did not
just say that, Al.

40:29.428 --> 40:32.262
Uh, please hold. Ned, Ned,
he says he's on Route 7.

40:32.364 --> 40:33.963
I think he's going to
the wrong address.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.799
What? I want that man fired!

40:35.901 --> 40:38.334
Oh, whoa, whoa, Ned.
Okay, look, look,

40:38.437 --> 40:40.069
cool your jets, okay?

40:40.172 --> 40:41.692
I know that Roy is
your brother-in-law,

40:41.740 --> 40:44.107
but let's give the
man a chance, okay?

40:44.209 --> 40:46.142
Al, Al, listen, are you with me?

40:46.244 --> 40:48.344
Listen, you're going to
the wrong address, okay?

40:48.447 --> 40:51.815
You want to go to 870
Juniper Road, you got that?

40:51.917 --> 40:53.783
<i>870 Juniper. Got it.</i>

40:53.885 --> 40:55.485
<i>Am I in trouble?</i>

40:55.587 --> 40:57.198
Not if you get there in
the next 10 minutes.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.755
Good luck, Al.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.290
Nice. Yes.

41:00.392 --> 41:01.825
- Oh, 10 minutes. Come on.
- Okay.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.327
- We got to go.
- Where are my keys?

41:11.536 --> 41:13.403
[grunts]

41:16.908 --> 41:21.010
Tell Sue Dodie that was 9
minutes and 58 seconds.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.278
What happened?

41:22.380 --> 41:23.813
I was running late.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.149
I had to cross the river
at Marineaux Road.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.585
They got a bridge there now?

41:28.687 --> 41:29.853
No.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.855
They really could
use one, though.

41:31.957 --> 41:34.524
This looks like a high school.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.859
Yeah, you know, Roy decided.

41:35.961 --> 41:37.527
Tower wasn't big enough for him,

41:37.629 --> 41:39.362
went out and bought
himself a high school.

41:39.464 --> 41:41.498
- Pretty nifty, huh?
- I guess so.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.199
It doesn't look like
a store, though.

41:43.301 --> 41:44.801
Thank you, Al.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.803
That's exactly the look
we were looking for.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.972
Yeah. Latest thing in
kids' marketing, Al.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.751
You make them think they're
in school, and then bam!

41:50.775 --> 41:52.141
Toys.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.277
Yeah, yeah, our new slogan is,

41:54.379 --> 41:56.513
"It's always recess
at Roy's Toys."

41:56.615 --> 41:57.847
Ah. Not bad.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.182
Yeah.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.884
Hey, want me to
pull around back?

42:00.986 --> 42:02.906
We're already unloading, Al.
Thank you, though.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.593
Gotcha.

42:13.265 --> 42:14.642
Do you think Barnes
will report us?

42:14.666 --> 42:15.743
For taking back our own stuff?

42:15.767 --> 42:17.800
Not likely.

42:24.676 --> 42:27.243
- That's it.
- We did it. Ah!

42:27.345 --> 42:29.646
Nice, partner. Nice.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.180
Got it.

42:55.140 --> 42:57.640
Yeah, me too.

42:57.742 --> 42:58.875
Oh, this is me right here.

42:58.977 --> 43:00.443
Up and to the left.

43:02.347 --> 43:04.113
Thanks for the lift.

43:05.817 --> 43:07.183
You know, the last
thing I expected

43:07.285 --> 43:08.551
was to have fun tonight.

43:08.653 --> 43:09.653
Me too.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.421
But you did?

43:11.523 --> 43:13.823
Overall, I'd say it was
better than a head cold

43:13.925 --> 43:15.692
or filing a tax return.

43:15.794 --> 43:18.628
You know, when you gush like
that, it just embarrasses me.

43:18.730 --> 43:20.763
Good night, DiNova.

43:20.865 --> 43:22.565
By the way, would it kill us

43:22.667 --> 43:24.867
if we started using first names?

43:24.970 --> 43:26.769
Why take chances?

43:26.871 --> 43:30.273
Come on. Just try saying,
"Good night, Will."

43:31.910 --> 43:33.843
Good night, Will.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.845
There you go. Was that so bad?

43:35.947 --> 43:36.779
Sort of.

43:36.881 --> 43:38.314
[laughs]

43:38.416 --> 43:40.083
- Good night, Connie.
- Good night.

43:40.185 --> 43:43.186
And listen, now that we have
the dolls and Roy doesn't,

43:43.288 --> 43:44.954
tomorrow's going
to be a mob scene.

43:45.056 --> 43:46.889
Get some sleep.

43:50.161 --> 43:51.561
[car door closes]

44:00.405 --> 44:02.171
Some mob scene.
Where is everybody?

44:02.273 --> 44:04.151
I don't know. Is there
something great showing on TV,

44:04.175 --> 44:06.042
like <i> The Godfather,</i>
or <i> John Wick 2?</i>

44:06.144 --> 44:07.510
I doubt it, Randy.

44:07.612 --> 44:09.445
No,<i> John Wick 2.</i>

44:09.547 --> 44:11.347
I heard you.

44:11.449 --> 44:13.449
Maybe they're all at DiNova's.

44:18.089 --> 44:19.422
Hello?

44:19.524 --> 44:21.157
We're back here.

44:28.733 --> 44:30.500
Our customers.

44:30.602 --> 44:32.502

44:52.157 --> 44:54.991

44:55.093 --> 44:59.128
Yup. We got the dolls,
but he got the diva.

Mike.

45:14.979 --> 45:18.648
Hey. Listen, business took
a major hit on Tuesday.

45:18.750 --> 45:20.116
It picked back up
again yesterday,

45:20.218 --> 45:22.685
but that balloon payment
I have coming up,

45:22.787 --> 45:24.554
I'm going to be a little short.

45:24.656 --> 45:26.556
How short?

45:26.658 --> 45:27.824
Uh...

45:27.926 --> 45:29.158
Chihuahua?

45:29.260 --> 45:30.860
That's pretty short.

45:30.962 --> 45:32.929
I know, I know. I have
to ask for an extension.

45:33.031 --> 45:35.465
I can give you $30,000
now, but the other $40,000

45:35.567 --> 45:37.533
maybe in three months.

45:37.635 --> 45:39.435
- Fine.
- Before you shoot me down,

45:39.537 --> 45:41.537
I just want to say that...
Wait, what?

45:41.639 --> 45:43.940
I'll have to run it by Mr.
Harris, of course,

45:44.042 --> 45:46.309
but I'm confident
he'll be agreeable.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.811
Really? You're not joking?

45:48.913 --> 45:50.446
Connie, have you
ever met a banker

45:50.548 --> 45:52.014
that had you rolling
in the aisles?

45:53.218 --> 45:54.350
Good point.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.085
Thanks, Mike. Merry Christmas.

45:56.187 --> 45:57.687
- Merry Christmas.
- [laughs]

45:59.190 --> 46:02.425
Plus a little cooking oil
for added viscosity.

46:03.595 --> 46:05.394
And then you just stir.

46:05.497 --> 46:07.530
And voilà.

46:07.632 --> 46:09.031
Then it just sits
here overnight?

46:09.134 --> 46:10.767
That's it, buddy.

46:10.869 --> 46:12.546
You just got to leave
these garage doors open,

46:12.570 --> 46:15.605
and by the morning these
runners will be pure ice.

46:15.707 --> 46:17.273
Grease lightning.

46:18.376 --> 46:19.876
- Not bad.
- Hmm.

46:19.978 --> 46:22.812
Will this really work?

46:22.914 --> 46:24.781
Well, it worked against
Mark and Frankie.

46:24.883 --> 46:28.217
Mom, I think Will might be
almost as smart as you.

46:28.319 --> 46:30.253
Not quite.

46:30.355 --> 46:32.255
But I have my moments.

46:33.591 --> 46:35.558
Dinner's ready, everybody.

46:35.660 --> 46:37.093
Will, why don't you join us.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.266
Come on.

46:45.804 --> 46:47.570
No, you cannot see that movie.

46:47.672 --> 46:50.540
You're not allowed. Not
for another 10 years.

46:50.642 --> 46:53.209
- Mm.
- Mom, do you think Roy Barnes

46:53.311 --> 46:54.577
will be at the race tomorrow?

46:54.679 --> 46:56.112
Oh, I'm sure of it, kiddo.

46:56.214 --> 46:58.548
Doesn't he live
down in Stanford?

46:58.650 --> 47:00.594
- Yeah, but he'll be there.
- Oh, I burned him but good

47:00.618 --> 47:02.752
the other night when I drove
past the gas station.

47:02.854 --> 47:04.954
You guys should have been there.

47:05.056 --> 47:05.922
It was the night
that I installed

47:06.024 --> 47:07.423
the Gnome in the Home.

47:07.525 --> 47:08.991
- Remember?
- Oh, yeah, I remember.

47:09.093 --> 47:11.861
Yeah. So he's over by
the station pumps,

47:11.963 --> 47:13.663
just yakking with some dude.

47:13.765 --> 47:17.266
And I cruise up and start
going, "Hey, Neil Armstrong."

47:17.368 --> 47:19.502
Neil Armstrong."

47:19.604 --> 47:21.671
I rocked him to the core.

47:23.074 --> 47:24.473
Neil Armstrong? Like...

47:24.576 --> 47:26.175
Like the first man
to walk on the moon?

47:26.277 --> 47:27.888
Yeah. Yeah, like, "one
small step for man,

47:27.912 --> 47:29.946
one giant leap for mankind."

47:31.249 --> 47:32.915
I was calling him a space cadet.

47:33.017 --> 47:34.929
I was telling him to moonwalk
back where he came from.

47:34.953 --> 47:36.385
Neil Armstrong. Come on.

47:36.487 --> 47:38.065
Don't tell me you never
heard of that before.

47:38.089 --> 47:39.649
- I never heard that before.
- Ah, well,

47:39.691 --> 47:41.624
I guess it's just not hip
enough for you then.

47:41.726 --> 47:43.226
Kids all know what
it means, right?

47:43.328 --> 47:45.895
I never heard it
before either, no.

47:47.565 --> 47:50.499
Well, I mean, the young kids.

47:50.602 --> 47:52.802
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:02.547 --> 48:04.847
- Thanks for dinner.
- Oh, thank you.

48:04.949 --> 48:08.317
It was nice to get my mind off
Roy Barnes for a few hours.

48:08.419 --> 48:10.620
Do you think he even enjoys
what makes him rich?

48:10.722 --> 48:13.155
You know, toys,
children, all of that?

48:13.258 --> 48:15.358
Not the way you do.

48:15.460 --> 48:17.793
You really love it, don't you?

48:17.896 --> 48:19.495
Why do you love it so much?

48:19.597 --> 48:22.398
Well, what do you remember
about growing up?

48:22.500 --> 48:24.166
I mean, before the age of 10.

48:24.269 --> 48:26.168
Not much.

48:26.271 --> 48:27.670
Most people don't.

48:27.772 --> 48:31.073
But I bet there's a
special toy you remember.

48:34.479 --> 48:37.046
Hot Wheels Spiral Speedway.

48:37.148 --> 48:39.148
Got it for my 8th birthday.

48:39.250 --> 48:40.516
See what I mean?

48:40.618 --> 48:42.618
Ah, Spiral Speedway.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.754
Mattel introduced that in 1983,

48:44.856 --> 48:46.188
discontinued in '91.

48:46.291 --> 48:47.523
Awesome track.

48:47.625 --> 48:49.225
Whoa.

48:49.327 --> 48:52.762
Well, when I help a child
find the perfect toy,

48:52.864 --> 48:54.144
it doesn't just make them happy.

48:54.232 --> 48:57.366
It creates a memory...
sometimes.

48:57.468 --> 48:59.502
And when I do that, well,

48:59.604 --> 49:02.605
it's not solving world peace,

49:02.707 --> 49:04.840
but it's not nothing
either, right>??

49:04.943 --> 49:07.276
Far from it.

49:10.715 --> 49:13.049
Hey, uh, do you
mind if I ask you

49:13.151 --> 49:14.817
a somewhat personal question?

49:14.919 --> 49:18.321
I guess I'd have
to hear it first.

49:18.423 --> 49:22.491
Have you been out
with anybody since...

49:22.593 --> 49:25.895
Since I lost my husband?

49:27.365 --> 49:30.700
The answer is yes.

49:30.802 --> 49:34.203
Yes?

49:34.305 --> 49:37.473
Yes, I do mind the somewhat
personal question.

49:37.575 --> 49:39.141
Sorry.

49:41.713 --> 49:43.446
For what?

49:46.150 --> 49:48.351
All right, well, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

49:49.554 --> 49:51.287
Top of the hill.

49:51.389 --> 49:53.055
Top of the hill.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.467
[engine starts]

50:21.486 --> 50:23.452
[exhales]

50:28.426 --> 50:30.059
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.

50:30.161 --> 50:32.081
- This is it right here.
- Careful, TJ. Slippery.

50:32.163 --> 50:33.896
- He's all right.
- All right.

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:07.128
Free and clear.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:08.996
You deserve it.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.466
A lot more than I deserve you.

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:18.439
But Barnes will just put me
out of business in a year.

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:20.908
Then we'll just have
to fight him somehow.

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.947
Where have you been
all this time?

01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:28.049
Just up the street.

01:16:46.703 --> 01:16:48.069
- Hey.
- Hi, Joe.

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:49.770
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no, no.

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:51.706
Come on in, come on in.

01:16:51.808 --> 01:16:53.541
Well, how about some coffee?

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:54.942
Oh, no, thanks.

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:56.677
I was just getting
ready for church.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.857
I guess I probably shouldn't
wear a tie with this shirt,

01:16:58.881 --> 01:16:59.981
should I?

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.682
No, you don't need it.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:05.820
Listen, I just came by
to return this check.

01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:07.088
It's too much money.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:09.657
Well, uh... Christmas bonus.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:11.859
Well, that's very
generous of you,

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.995
but I don't think I deserve it.

01:17:14.097 --> 01:17:15.663
You're not making much progress.

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:18.366
You're not making any progress.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:20.735
Have you been practicing two
hours a day like I asked?

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:22.014
Because your niece
Tilly's wedding

01:17:22.038 --> 01:17:23.137
is right around the corner.

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:24.839
[sighs]

01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:28.676
Joe, where's your piano?

01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:32.947
[chuckles]

01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:37.852
You don't have a piano, do you?

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:39.854
I don't have a niece
Tilly either.

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:42.056
But I've been giving you lessons

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:43.891
every day for three weeks.

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:48.863
And they were worth every penny.

01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:58.739
Oh. Hey, Francine.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.474
Connie's not here.

01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:03.811
Uh, no, I'm not here for her.

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:06.480
Randy, do you have a minute?

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:09.684
There's something I
need you to see.

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:11.018
Yeah.

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:28.602
[sighs]

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:32.807
You caught the shoplifter?

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:36.110
Um, no, Randy.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:38.879
I am the shoplifter.

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:41.348
But I'm returning everything.

01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:42.750
Unopened.

01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:45.653
And I'll turn myself
in, if you like.

01:18:45.755 --> 01:18:47.855
But why did you...?

01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:52.993
I wanted you to notice me.

01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:54.895
What for?

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:14.081
I'll set fire to
the sign tomorrow.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:17.852
Oh, careful there, kid.
Arson's a serious crime.

01:19:17.954 --> 01:19:19.086
- [chuckles]
- Don't forget,

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.554
the gnome sees all.

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:24.692
The Gnome in the Home.

01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:33.901
It was facing the wrong way.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:18.112
Your faces, your cars,
your license plates.

01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:19.513
You're toast.

01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:21.916
Yeah. Just met this
guy today, huh, Roy?

01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:24.852
I gave you my kidney,
for crying out loud.

01:20:24.954 --> 01:20:27.188
What did he ever give you?

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.756
Eight grand.

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:30.191
Eight gra...!

01:20:30.293 --> 01:20:32.293
That's it. I want
my kidney back.

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:34.528
I want it now. Hand it over!

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:36.163
Wait, you know what?

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:37.898
I'm just going to
take it from you!

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.234
Get over here!

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:42.069
Field estimate.

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:44.305
What are my chances of winning
if that goes to trial?

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:49.844
I hate that number.

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:52.947
[laughs]

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:58.085
Hey!

01:20:59.222 --> 01:21:01.021
Good work.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:12.687
Thank you, Pam and Joe Haggarty,

01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:14.869
for that lovely accompaniment.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:18.539
Many of you were present at
their wedding this past spring.

01:21:18.641 --> 01:21:20.841
Although tonight, we
are all gathered here

01:21:20.943 --> 01:21:25.145
to celebrate the union
between Connie and Will.

01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:45.466
[applause]
