10:39.705 --> 10:42.607
<i>What do you do in san jose,</i>
<i>mr. Massey?</i>

10:42.609 --> 10:45.343
Hunt:
<i>Physical therapy. I specialize</i>
<i>in sports injuries.</i>

10:45.345 --> 10:46.978
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>Apple doesn't fall far.</i>

10:46.980 --> 10:49.414
It falls far enough.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.250
Any luck
in finding my dad?

10:52.252 --> 10:54.619
Sir, we're hoping you
might provide information
that can help us.

10:54.621 --> 10:57.822
I mean,
if there's anything, sir --
I-I don't even
know him that well, really.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.691
He's been on the road
for years,

10:59.693 --> 11:02.661
And he wasn't so reliable
when he was home, either.

11:02.663 --> 11:06.531
In fact, the first thing I
thought today when he wasn't
there to pick me up...

11:06.533 --> 11:09.734
[ chuckles ]
...Was, "typical."

11:09.736 --> 11:12.270
What's the reason
for your visit?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.639
I just went through
a divorce myself.

11:14.641 --> 11:18.977
My ex has our son
till January.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.512
Guess you could say,
now I know

11:20.514 --> 11:22.013
How the shoe feels
on the other foot.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.815
<i>Thought I'd spend</i>
<i>the holidays with my dad</i>

11:23.817 --> 11:26.384
<i>Since we're both</i>
<i>a little on our own now.</i>

11:26.386 --> 11:28.753
It's one horrible christmas
story after another.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.456
Captain,
we found an atm withdrawal

11:31.458 --> 11:33.625
Made to hunt massey's
checking account last night

11:33.627 --> 11:35.960
At 8:17 p.M. In san jose.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.663
Well, assuming he's the one
who made the withdrawal,

11:38.665 --> 11:40.365
That's
a pretty tight alibi.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.434
We're getting security footage
to confirm.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.569
Okay, buzz,
check your e-mail.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.438
I gave the bank
your address.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.774
Okay.
<i>In your recent conversations</i>
<i>with him,</i>

11:49.776 --> 11:52.610
<i>Did he mention any new friends</i>
<i>or acquaintances he'd made?</i>
<i>Here it is.</i>

11:52.612 --> 11:56.681
<i>No. He pretty much</i>
<i>just keeps to himself.</i>
<i>Looks like the same guy.</i>

11:56.683 --> 11:58.416
So he's not our killer.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.319
Buzz?
Right.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.755
[ beep ]
buzz: Detective sykes,
happy holidays.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.458
You can make
the notification now. Sorry.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.094
[ sighs ]

12:09.096 --> 12:11.463
Mr. Massey,
first, I want to apologize.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.798
We needed to confirm
your whereabouts last night

12:13.800 --> 12:15.633
Before we could
tell you what happened.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.502
My whereabouts?

12:17.504 --> 12:19.504
What does that have to do
with finding my dad?

12:19.506 --> 12:20.872
We have some bad news,
sir.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.875
Your father...

12:23.877 --> 12:27.879
Was found murdered
inside his r.V.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.781
What?

12:29.783 --> 12:32.117
Oh, my god.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.753
Sir, we needed to
rule you out so that we --
and -- and you thought
I killed him?

12:34.755 --> 12:37.689
This is unbelievable!

12:37.691 --> 12:39.691
<i>I rode in the back</i>
<i>of that car with you</i>
<i>for half an hour.</i>

12:39.693 --> 12:41.693
<i>You didn't say a damn word</i>
<i>about my dad being dead!</i>

12:41.695 --> 12:43.428
I understand this is difficult.
I'm sorry.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.897
I got to go. I got to
talk to my mom and my sister.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.132
Sir, we recovered
several items

12:47.134 --> 12:48.800
That were stolen
from your dad's r.V.,

12:48.802 --> 12:51.503
And we have some questions --
please.

12:51.505 --> 12:54.606
And I know this is hard,
but if we are gonna

12:54.608 --> 12:57.609
Find the person who
hurt your father, we
still need your help.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.780
Will you help us?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.487
Sharon: Your father's computer
is missing.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.390
We figured whoever it was
that attacked him kept it.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.794
Could there be anything
on there that the killer
didn't want us to find?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.796
Honestly,
I-I don't know.

13:17.798 --> 13:21.666
I also noticed there's no
memory card in the video camera.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.768
Any chance he could have
sent them back to st. Louis?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.770
No, no.
He uploaded them. Always.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.172
I know this because
I helped him set up

13:27.174 --> 13:30.041
His cloudsaver account
online.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.443
[ chuckles ] that was
a 40-minute phone call.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.045
[ chuckles ]

13:34.047 --> 13:37.549
Anyway, uh, he takes the video
of the kids he's scouting,

13:37.551 --> 13:39.818
And he uploads it
to cloudsaver

13:39.820 --> 13:41.753
So his bosses in missouri
stay synched up with him.

13:41.755 --> 13:43.755
Are you able to
access that account?

13:43.757 --> 13:46.558
As long as he didn't change
his screen name or password.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.034
Ah! Okay, we're in.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.736
Buzz, can you do a thing?
What do you want to see?

13:58.738 --> 14:00.772
Yeah, go to the last thing
he had open on the site.

14:03.442 --> 14:06.778
This is from yesterday
at 8:15 a.M.

<i>Look at the red one.</i>

14:10.917 --> 14:13.218
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>look what santa brought.</i>

<i>You're welcome.</i>

Hunt, look in the tree.

14:25.664 --> 14:28.233
Could you turn that off,
please?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.501
[ <i>indistinct conversation</i> ]

14:30.503 --> 14:33.638
Buzz, why don't you
look at the files
from the date created

14:33.640 --> 14:35.707
And go from
the last one of those?

14:35.709 --> 14:37.809
Yeah, that's --
that's a good idea.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.714
[ <i>indistinct shouting</i> ]
yeah, that's the game
he was scouting.

14:42.716 --> 14:46.217
Yeah, that --
that's what you want.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.888
Oh, wait.
There's a marker on the film.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.756
After the camera
goes upside down,

15:58.758 --> 16:00.892
When he walked away.
Um...

Uh, there.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.330
Can you flip the image?
Sure.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.668
Andy, is that
the victim's r.V.?

16:10.670 --> 16:13.237
It is.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.879
This is where
the argument happened.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.281
And the crime scene
was up here.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.916
Hey, guys, over here.

16:24.918 --> 16:28.353
We got glass
and lots of it.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.356
Flynn: From the broken
r.V. Window.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.858
So this is where
massey was killed.

16:33.860 --> 16:37.195
But why drive the r.V.
To the beach?

16:37.197 --> 16:40.231
Maybe the angry dad
from the ballgame can tell us.

You know,
you don't have to

Go to all this trouble
for me, sharon.

Don't you like christmas?

thought about it much.

Oh.

You do
seem a little down.

Is everything okay
with dr. Joe?

17:14.634 --> 17:17.135
Of course, you don't have to
tell me anything

17:17.137 --> 17:19.103
If you don't want to.

17:19.105 --> 17:22.273
I've been
talking about my mom a lot.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.644
I don't know. I just --

17:26.646 --> 17:30.815
I feel guilty
she's out there somewhere,

17:30.817 --> 17:34.819
And I'm...
Here in this nice place

17:34.821 --> 17:36.788

Don't get me wrong,
sharon,

17:44.130 --> 17:46.931
Because you're -- you're really
important to me. I just...

17:46.933 --> 17:51.402
I-I also love my mom.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.404
I understand.

I have part of a third...

...I'll love him, too.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.823
I'm really sorry
that your mom

18:11.825 --> 18:14.826
Isn't able to share
in any of this with you.

18:14.828 --> 18:17.462
Yeah.

18:17.464 --> 18:22.166
Well, I don't know how much
she'd really appreciate it.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.235
Hmm.

18:24.237 --> 18:28.272

a lot of angel ornaments.

Bring me up to speed,

Flynn: Angry dad's name
is craig fowler,

18:42.789 --> 18:45.022
Known to have a temper,
the kind of aggressive asshole

18:45.024 --> 18:49.026
Who yells at his kid
and argues with all the umps.
Sounds like a prize parent.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.729
Yeah, we had him
brought in. Got here
about 10 minutes ago.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.397
Told him a complaint
had been

18:53.399 --> 18:55.366
Filed against him
after the game.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.869
Fowler: Sometimes
I take it a little too far.

18:57.871 --> 19:00.371
Other parents, they
don't like it when I
yell at the games.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.373
But I'm competitive.
What can I say?

19:02.375 --> 19:03.808
It's really not worth
all this attention.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.278
Ah, humor us.
Holidays are slow this year.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.181
Mr. Fowler, you know who
vince massey is, correct?

19:10.183 --> 19:13.384
Yeah, of course.
He's, uh, the baseball scout.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.419
Tell us about the argument
you had with him.

19:15.421 --> 19:18.890
What argument?
Mr. Fowler, we have video

19:18.892 --> 19:21.058
Of you physically assaulting
mr. Massey.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.028
Oh, come on.
I pushed him once.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.197
Is he the one
who made this complaint?

19:26.199 --> 19:28.533
Well, he's the reason
you're here.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.868
What happened?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.336
Massey called me last week.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.839
Said he wanted to
come to this game --

19:34.841 --> 19:37.508
The one two days ago --
to watch my son jason play.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.210
<i>I said, "great."</i>

19:39.212 --> 19:41.512
<i>Only problem was</i>
<i>jason's out of school,</i>

19:41.514 --> 19:44.048
And we had plans to visit
my wife's family in wisconsin.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.450
<i>So you canceled your trip?</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

19:46.452 --> 19:48.819
You can have a seat right here.
You don't turn your back
on an opportunity like that.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.055
<i>Why is it so important</i>
<i>massey see your son now?</i>

19:51.057 --> 19:53.925
Jason graduated
from high school early.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.526
He's off to college
in January.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.963
Once he's there, pro scouts
aren't allowed to talk to him.

19:58.965 --> 20:03.067
If a scout like massey
thinks jason is good
enough, which he is,

20:03.069 --> 20:05.570
<i>They'll sign him</i>
<i>to a holding deal so he could</i>

20:05.572 --> 20:08.306
Have a place on the team
after he gets his degree.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.808
What happened
at the game?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.243
So, massey was there,
right?

20:12.245 --> 20:14.312
And jason,
he's doing great.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.480
He's got four hits,
two runs.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.483
But almost from the start,
I could tell

20:19.485 --> 20:22.220
Massey's got his eye
on this other kid, reed.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.222
He's a switch pitcher
<i>on the team.</i>

20:24.224 --> 20:27.825
And, all right, I admit,
it's not something
you see every day.

20:27.827 --> 20:31.128
But this kid reed isn't
<i>anything special.</i>
<i>Sanchez: Reed downy.</i>
<i>That must be him.</i>

20:31.130 --> 20:33.831
Any idea why your father
may have been so interested

20:33.833 --> 20:36.834
In the boy
this guy is talking about?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.236
Well, now that I think about it,
that pitcher

20:38.238 --> 20:40.338

focus the discussion

32:43.295 --> 32:46.730
On matters that occurred
within the state of california?
Of course,

32:46.732 --> 32:49.833
Right after I establish
who your client actually is.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.335
Provenza:
<i>Rory's mother, cassy,</i>

32:51.337 --> 32:53.670
<i>Will be arriving at l.A.X.</i>
<i>Within the hour.</i>

32:53.672 --> 32:56.306
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>she knew your client</i>

32:56.308 --> 32:59.843
Very well, and probably
would recognize luke,

32:59.845 --> 33:02.079
Even now,
nine years later.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.781
I haven't gone by luke
in a long time.

33:04.783 --> 33:07.284
Yeah,
I'm guessing you changed it

33:07.286 --> 33:08.752
Right after you
murdered mark brooks
and kidnapped his son.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.187
Whoa, lieutenant,
these accusations

33:10.189 --> 33:12.789
Are out of your jurisdictional
authority and --

33:12.791 --> 33:14.157
And directly related
to the murder of vince massey.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.693
We know what you've done,
mr. Dalton.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.195
We just
need you to say it.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.064
And if you do,
then the d.A. Has agreed

33:21.066 --> 33:23.200
To take death
off the table.
What?

33:23.202 --> 33:25.102
First, we don't admit to
the murder at all.

33:25.104 --> 33:28.038
And this is not
a death-penalty case.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.239
There's no evidence
the killer was lying in wait.

33:29.241 --> 33:30.841
No evidence at all
that suggests --

33:30.843 --> 33:33.176
Life is the deal that
we are offering, mr. Jennings,

33:33.178 --> 33:36.179
And that is only provided
your client tells us

33:36.181 --> 33:39.383
How he killed
vince massey.

33:42.053 --> 33:46.390
If you really
care about rory,

33:46.392 --> 33:49.259
Now would be
the time to show it.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.129
Provenza: He is about to be
reunited with his mother,

33:52.131 --> 33:55.132
And I assure you they will
not hang around here long.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.041
No.

34:04.043 --> 34:07.377
I -- I'd like
a little time with reed.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.414
Oh, well, maybe he'll
stop by your prison

34:10.416 --> 34:13.183
When we extradite you
to missouri.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.384
Goodbye, luke.
Wait, wait, wait!

34:14.386 --> 34:16.753
Please!

34:16.755 --> 34:19.756
Look, this was all...

34:19.758 --> 34:21.825
A big...Accident.

34:21.827 --> 34:24.961
What do you mean?
I never planned on
taking the kid with me.

34:26.831 --> 34:31.701
I had an affair
with his mom, cassy,

34:31.703 --> 34:34.438
While his father
was in iraq,

34:34.440 --> 34:37.974
And I got
pretty close with rory.

34:37.976 --> 34:41.845
Then his father, mark,
came home from overseas,

34:41.847 --> 34:44.448
And cassy said
we were done.

34:44.450 --> 34:47.384
I got angry, left town.

34:47.386 --> 34:50.253
But mark had issues,
you know?

34:50.255 --> 34:52.322
Crap he took out
on his family.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.958
And cassy
sent me an e-mail,

34:54.960 --> 34:58.128
Said she was
scared of him again.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.297
So, one night when
I knew she was at work,

35:00.299 --> 35:02.833
I drove back to joplin,
called mark up,

35:02.835 --> 35:05.135
Tricked him into
meeting me.

35:05.137 --> 35:10.373
I was only trying to make sure
he never hurt anyone again.

35:11.809 --> 35:16.146
I didn't know rory was with him
until...Afterwards...

35:16.148 --> 35:17.981
When I got in his car.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.016
The kid popped up
in the backseat,

35:20.018 --> 35:22.886
And he knew me.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.488
You understand?

35:24.490 --> 35:27.724
I kind of changed my plans
after that.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.026
I headed for mexico
with the kid,

35:30.028 --> 35:33.797
Left mark's car
at the border.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.832
What did you tell rory?

35:35.834 --> 35:41.304
I said his parents ran off
and weren't coming back.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.174
I just kept repeating

35:44.176 --> 35:47.043
That I was the only person
he could trust

35:47.045 --> 35:49.212
Every day
until it was in his bones.

35:49.214 --> 35:52.082
Look, after what I did
to his father,

35:52.084 --> 35:56.786
I had two choices --
kill reed or take him with me.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.289
I chose to
take him with me.

35:59.291 --> 36:03.360
<i>I chose to take him.</i>

36:03.362 --> 36:07.030
<i>So you go to mexico,</i>
<i>change identities,</i>

36:07.032 --> 36:11.067
Spend the next nine years
as someone else.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.069
Okay, what happened
at the baseball game?

36:14.272 --> 36:17.140
I saw massey filming rory
with that camera.

36:17.142 --> 36:19.042
After the game,
he came up to me,

36:19.044 --> 36:21.311
Asked if
we had family in joplin.

36:21.313 --> 36:24.181
He said my son
reminded him of another
kid he'd known --

36:24.183 --> 36:28.552
A little boy
who threw with both arms.

36:28.554 --> 36:31.054
And how did you
break into massey's r.V.?

36:31.056 --> 36:33.924
I sent rory off
to get pizza with his team.

36:33.926 --> 36:35.926
After he left,
I knocked on massey's door,

36:35.928 --> 36:39.529
Asked if he remembered
the name of that kid in joplin

36:39.531 --> 36:43.066
Or if he had
a picture of him.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.435
And he said, "yes."

36:45.437 --> 36:48.805
<i>And then?</i>

36:48.807 --> 36:52.209
<i>He invited me in</i>
<i>to see the photographs,</i>

36:52.211 --> 36:53.977
<i>Got me a beer.</i>

36:53.979 --> 36:57.981
And when he turned around
to get another one,

36:57.983 --> 37:00.350
I hit him over the head
with something.

37:00.352 --> 37:03.553
Then I wrapped a cord
around his neck

37:03.555 --> 37:07.824
And pulled.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.459
But he was gonna report me.
I could tell.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.528
<i>He was</i>
<i>going to report me.</i>

37:11.530 --> 37:15.398
<i>Why did you</i>
<i>dump his belongings?</i>

37:15.400 --> 37:17.934
<i>I knew I couldn't</i>
<i>leave his computer,</i>

37:17.936 --> 37:20.270
<i>So I figured I'd make things</i>
<i>look like a robbery.</i>
<i>So that's it?</i>

37:20.272 --> 37:23.240
Except for putting him away
for life without parole.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.842
<i>Grabbed a bunch of his stuff,</i>
<i>tossed it in a dumpster.</i>

37:25.844 --> 37:27.344
Or I could
ignore the l.A.P.D.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.512
And have him
extradited to missouri.

37:29.514 --> 37:32.215
Do you want to go through
the years of trials and appeals

37:32.217 --> 37:34.384
Required
to put him to death?
<i>Can I see my son now?</i>

37:34.386 --> 37:36.920
And have rory on the witness
stand for the next decade

37:36.922 --> 37:39.022
Talking about
how his dad died?

37:39.024 --> 37:41.625
Or do we end it here?

38:03.281 --> 38:06.516
It was evidence,
so we had to open it,

38:06.518 --> 38:09.252
But I think your dad
meant it for you.

38:11.989 --> 38:13.523
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

38:19.630 --> 38:24.467
So, how long does this
allocution process take?

38:24.469 --> 38:27.470
If we find the body of rory's
father where he said it was,

38:27.472 --> 38:30.940
Two days from now, luke dalton
will tell his story in court.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.310
He will go to prison
until the day he dies.

38:33.312 --> 38:36.046
And the state will
arrange to release your
father's r.V. To you.

38:45.556 --> 38:47.424
[ clears throat ]

38:47.426 --> 38:50.060
Mrs. Brooks,
I'm lieutenant provenza.

38:50.062 --> 38:51.461
We spoke on the phone.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.564
Please call me cassy.
Is he here?

38:54.566 --> 38:58.568
Yes, ma'am.
Right this way.

39:16.153 --> 39:18.521
Rusty: What about
that stuff about my mother?

39:18.523 --> 39:21.691
I-I mean, it felt like
I was judging her.

39:21.693 --> 39:25.095
No, no, I don't think
you were doing that at all.

39:25.097 --> 39:27.964
It's hard to know how
to take these threats
against your life.

39:27.966 --> 39:31.134
Sometimes we unconsciously
confuse what scares us now

39:31.136 --> 39:33.303
With the things
that frightened us as kids,

39:33.305 --> 39:36.473
So I think you were...

39:36.475 --> 39:40.043
Maybe storing some of your
anxiety in a familiar place.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.544
That's it.

39:41.546 --> 39:46.249
Is that bad?
I-I mean...

39:46.251 --> 39:48.718
How do <i>you</i> think
I'm doing?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.520
I think...

39:52.189 --> 39:55.058
...You have a lot
on your plate right now,

39:55.060 --> 39:57.360
And we're not even looking
at the whole plate, are we?

39:59.463 --> 40:02.699
One last question.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.634
Walk me out.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.543
The last question?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.712
If your mom
came back today,

40:15.714 --> 40:17.814
Would you get in a car
and drive off with her...

40:20.718 --> 40:23.653
...Or would you stay
where you are with sharon?

40:23.655 --> 40:26.723
I don't know anymore.

40:28.626 --> 40:30.627
I-I don't know.

40:30.629 --> 40:33.463
Interesting. Okay.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.799
Well,
that's good, I think.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.867
That's good.

40:40.171 --> 40:41.704
Oh. Are you done?

40:41.706 --> 40:45.141
Yes. I'll have my evaluation in
to chief taylor next Monday.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.344
But if he ever wants to call me,
I'm back after christmas.

40:48.346 --> 40:51.247
And I'd love to hear from you,
rusty. I would.

40:53.317 --> 40:56.486
Thank you, dr. Joe.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.855
Thanks.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.829
Why don't you
hang onto this?

41:05.831 --> 41:07.397
You may want it.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.366
Oh,
it's a hell of a thing --

41:10.368 --> 41:14.637
Reunited with his mom
after all this time apart.

41:20.311 --> 41:24.681
Wonder what's going through
the kid's mind right now, huh?

41:24.683 --> 41:27.750
Sharon:
It's impossible to say.
