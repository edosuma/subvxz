WEBVTT

00:05.964 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:58.475 --> 00:59.851
Mariachi!

01:16.034 --> 01:17.243
How does it go?

02:25.645 --> 02:26.646
I'll never...

02:28.898 --> 02:30.900
sing in a <i>palenque</i> again.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.070
Understood?

02:39.534 --> 02:40.994
I want to launch a new album.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.080
We haven't spoken
with the record label in years.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.415
Don't even know how many.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.711
I don't know, around four or five years.

02:49.794 --> 02:53.548
I think we should focus
on settling all the debts

02:53.631 --> 02:55.174
and not recording a new album.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.430
Besides, I doubt
Julio will sign us that easily.

03:00.513 --> 03:04.559
- Especially as he knows our situation.
- He doesn't have to give me anything.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.854
I signed with him in...

03:09.189 --> 03:11.232
in 2008 for a new album.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.867
I guess Ambrosi
was your manager back then.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.329
That means he'd be producing this album.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.080
No!

03:26.164 --> 03:28.666
Ambrosi can't be in this album.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.169
Talk to him, offer him money.

03:31.252 --> 03:34.547
Do whatever you need to do,
he just can't be in the album.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.513
It's getting late. Are you staying?

03:44.432 --> 03:45.475
Okay, Micky?

03:46.392 --> 03:48.311
What I want is to record a new album,

03:49.354 --> 03:50.188
right away.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.734
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.152
Good night.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.029
Ambrosi can't be in the credits.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.740
Yes, Micky, I'll talk to him.

04:00.823 --> 04:01.783
See you.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.499
Jeez!

04:57.213 --> 05:00.550
Micky, man, it's amazing,
it's gonna be a massive hit!

05:01.050 --> 05:02.468
Good, isn't it?

05:02.552 --> 05:04.804
Was this recorded in the Rainbow Room?

05:04.887 --> 05:07.640
Of course. We got the Rainbow Room
in New York closed.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.143
And the model,

05:11.185 --> 05:12.478
she was spectacular.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.105
Stop it, man!

05:14.188 --> 05:16.858
Hey, does black and white work?

05:16.941 --> 05:18.526
It works perfect, Micky.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.195
Mau?

05:23.072 --> 05:24.282
He's absolutely right.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.786
- It's his thing, it makes it unique.
- You know what would be amazing?

05:29.746 --> 05:32.332
If this time we could use the album name.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.791
That'd be great, right?

05:35.001 --> 05:37.170
Or will someone
be suing like the last time?

05:39.297 --> 05:40.548
Everything's perfect.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.800
"Everything's perfect."

05:44.260 --> 05:46.763
Make sure the album sells well.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.390
- Come with me, let's talk.
- Yes.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.062
Paulina, tell José
I'll be right down, okay? Thanks.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.203
You're leaving again?

06:11.454 --> 06:12.455
What's with you?

06:14.415 --> 06:16.626
- Have it ready ASAP.
- Of course.

06:17.835 --> 06:18.836
Have a good trip.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.173
I don't know what you mean.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.258
You're never in the office.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.345
You've been to the US
30 times to see God knows who.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.306
Relax, cousin, chill.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.600
Will you?

06:33.184 --> 06:34.894
You look too relaxed

06:34.977 --> 06:37.688
for someone who owes
millions of dollars to his boss.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.442
Will you excuse me?

06:43.945 --> 06:44.987
Thanks.

08:32.845 --> 08:33.679
Micky.

08:35.723 --> 08:36.682
How are you?

08:38.184 --> 08:39.018
Good,

08:40.061 --> 08:42.063
but I have bad news.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.564
Really?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.609
Don't tell me we're out of wine.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.530
No, I spoke to Mauricio.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.323
And?

08:53.824 --> 08:55.701
He said yes, but he wants to see you.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.082
What?

09:01.707 --> 09:04.085
He will sign the release,

09:04.919 --> 09:06.420
but only if it's in person.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.509
You're so incompetent.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.390
I asked for one thing.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.394
For you to solve the Ambrosi issue.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.275
What use are you to me?
You don't do your job.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.822
I end up doing everything.
Damn it! Fucking shit!

09:33.406 --> 09:36.033
Do you know what it means
to me to see that asshole?

09:38.494 --> 09:40.955
Or can't you do your fucking job properly?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.338
Look, Micky,

09:50.589 --> 09:52.300
you're wrong about this.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.637
I'm your lawyer, not your assistant.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.932
And my "fucking job" is negotiating,

10:00.516 --> 10:01.601
that's what I did.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.186
You know what I achieved? He'll sign,

10:04.770 --> 10:06.522
as long as it's in person.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.567
So, suck it up
and stop beating yourself up about it.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.689
Remove these two entries
and give it to Julián.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.245
- Yes?
- May I come in?

11:44.328 --> 11:46.372
Of course. Please, come in.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.874
I just came to say goodbye.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.169
I'm off to New York to get
the new saxophonist Micky wants.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.464
I'm sure you'll get him, man. You'll see.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.091
Mau,

11:57.591 --> 12:00.553
you're doing a phenomenal job
with the new album.

12:00.636 --> 12:04.265
I don't know what I was thinking
putting you in charge of the fan club.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.517
Well, it wasn't that bad.

12:07.601 --> 12:08.936
But thanks, I mean it.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.689
- Take care of things here.
- Of course.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.358
You won't regret it.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.318
- Take care, Mau.
- Have a good trip.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.403
Thanks.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.321
They thought it was me.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.658
- And they asked me for a picture.
- Of course not.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.993
I swear.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.579
- What happened when you woke up?
- Really.

12:26.662 --> 12:29.290
José, get back to work.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.668
What do you want me to do?
Micky isn't here.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.587
Find something that needs cleaning.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.214
I don't know.
And you, don't encourage him.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.637
I'm Luis Miguel's personal secretary.

12:44.221 --> 12:47.057
- He wants me to clean?
- José, it could be worse.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.213
It's a real pleasure.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.549
I'm delighted to meet you, dear.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.551
Sit.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.656
I'll give you $100,000 dollars
if you cancel the contract.

14:26.949 --> 14:27.783
Sign.

14:32.079 --> 14:35.207
Do you really think I came
all this way to negotiate with you?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.423
I don't want a cent, Micky.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.718
Not at all.

14:48.304 --> 14:52.516
So, why are you here, Mauricio?
You wanted us to talk?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.727
To catch up?

14:55.227 --> 14:56.812
To have some wine as friends?

14:58.897 --> 15:00.232
We never talked, Micky.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.320
After you found out,

15:04.403 --> 15:05.779
we never talked.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.198
We're not talking!

15:09.617 --> 15:10.826
Sign.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.494
It's my only condition.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.704
No.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.956
You don't get to set conditions.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.877
Do you know how much you hurt me?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.132
And I loved you so much.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.426
I gave you so much.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.308
How do you think I felt?

15:36.935 --> 15:39.313
And you, what did you expect?

15:39.396 --> 15:41.899
That we'd be talking here?

15:41.982 --> 15:45.861
That you'd tell me how you were sleeping
with my daughter behind my back?

15:47.571 --> 15:48.447
Is that it?

15:49.406 --> 15:51.575
How, while I couldn't sleep dreading

15:51.659 --> 15:54.411
I'd never sing again,
you were with my daughter?

15:54.495 --> 15:56.080
- Micky--
- My daughter!

15:57.164 --> 15:58.874
That's not how it happened, Micky.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.585
It wasn't.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.004
My best friend,

16:05.464 --> 16:06.966
the man I trusted...

16:12.346 --> 16:13.597
is a piece of shit.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.312
You're right.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.400
You're right.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.948
But you never
gave me the chance to apologize.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.704
Don't play innocent, asshole.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.206
That's bullshit!

16:40.541 --> 16:44.378
What? You felt so much remorse,
after I caught you,

16:44.461 --> 16:47.548
you kept seeing
each other two, three years?

16:48.757 --> 16:50.134
We loved each other, Micky.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.387
We really did.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.808
And that's what you never understood.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.939
You thought, as you always do,
that we did it to hurt you.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.486
And we didn't.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.116
I was deeply in love with your daughter.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.704
I know I made a mistake.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.417
I was wrong not to tell you the truth.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.046
I admit it.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.843
It cost me my best friend.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.229
Look, I know between you and me
there's no going back.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.399
Such is life.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.778
But Michelle...

17:53.363 --> 17:54.907
Micky, she's your daughter.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.663
Sign the contract and leave.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.638
Damn, she's your daughter!

18:20.307 --> 18:21.141
Call her.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.144
And take care,

18:25.646 --> 18:26.480
Micky.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.115
My dear Julio.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.200
How's it going?

20:44.284 --> 20:45.369
Thanks for coming.

20:45.869 --> 20:46.745
You look good.

20:49.122 --> 20:52.668
- Aren't you tired from the trip?
- No, I didn't even bring a suitcase.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.044
Where's Micky?

20:54.753 --> 20:56.338
He says he's sorry,

20:56.421 --> 20:59.132
a very important personal matter came up.

21:03.011 --> 21:03.929
But look,

21:05.013 --> 21:06.014
we got it.

21:07.265 --> 21:10.477
It was really hard,
but at last we have Ambrosi's release.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.194
- I've been thinking a lot about the album.
- Yes, I know.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.031
I understand Warner isn't sure

21:23.991 --> 21:25.617
about recording this album.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.245
I get it, given--

21:28.745 --> 21:31.999
Given Luis Miguel
has been pretty erratic lately.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.001
But Julio,

21:34.543 --> 21:36.628
things are changing, I assure you.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.841
Look, Micky wants you
to go see him in Tijuana.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.135
It's this Saturday.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.928
Just listen to him sing,

21:45.012 --> 21:46.513
then you decide.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.808
It's been 20 years.

21:50.851 --> 21:51.768
Twenty years.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.147
You owe him as much, don't you?

22:20.672 --> 22:22.257
Really, Karla? In the office?

22:24.009 --> 22:25.385
Are you gonna tell on me?

22:28.513 --> 22:30.974
I have to finish this
and I'm not even halfway.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.561
Hey, do you know
why Patricio went to the States?

22:35.896 --> 22:37.189
Sort of.

22:37.898 --> 22:41.526
- You're not worried about what he does?
- Julián, I'm not his mom.

22:41.610 --> 22:44.780
You're too laid back
after what happened with "Nada Es Igual."

22:45.280 --> 22:47.366
You work here too, you're his lawyer.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.286
Patricio isn't stupid.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.832
If things go south,
I'll get another job, who cares?

22:55.916 --> 23:00.420
It's fine, it's not the end of the world.
Are you finished? I have to finish this.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.427
It looks perfect on you.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.596
- You think?
- Yes.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.891
And just wait til you see
the ballroom costume.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.645
Ballroom costume? I'll have to dance?

23:16.728 --> 23:17.771
Of course!

23:18.939 --> 23:22.484
- Didn't you read the script?
- I've been really busy.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.403
But we're hanging in there.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.655
Yeah, don't worry.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.448
When you're back from Wellington,

23:28.532 --> 23:31.326
you'll know all your scenes
from top to bottom.

23:31.409 --> 23:33.245
What do you mean Wellington?

23:33.745 --> 23:34.996
New Zealand.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.875
That's where the director lives,
he loves having the cast rehearsal there.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.168
Yeah, gosh,

23:40.252 --> 23:42.254
you'll be rehearsing a month and a half.

23:42.337 --> 23:44.798
And then, six months of shooting.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.007
Six months?

23:46.091 --> 23:47.676
Yeah, the usual.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.095
Unless there's a sequel.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.616
- Hi.
- I'm glad you made it.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.577
- It's about to end, come.
- Great.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.136
Patricio?

28:42.345 --> 28:43.555
What are you doing here?

28:47.225 --> 28:48.643
How's the movie going? Okay?

28:49.769 --> 28:51.104
Yeah, really well.

28:52.939 --> 28:53.940
What do you want?

28:57.735 --> 28:59.237
You haven't signed, have you?

29:00.697 --> 29:03.950
No, we're in negotiations,

29:04.033 --> 29:07.370
wardrobe fitting,

29:07.454 --> 29:08.746
script rehearsals--

29:08.830 --> 29:10.290
You know.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.875
But, have you signed anything?

29:20.508 --> 29:21.718
Why do you ask?

29:23.344 --> 29:25.430
I was just with David Foster.

29:26.681 --> 29:28.016
Does the name ring a bell?

29:28.850 --> 29:29.684
No.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.644
What do you think, man?

29:33.271 --> 29:36.024
I didn't want to say anything
until it was a sure thing.

29:37.525 --> 29:41.654
He wants you to record
the <i>Great American Songbook.</i>

29:49.579 --> 29:50.455
Wait.

29:51.581 --> 29:55.919
David Foster wants me to record
the <i>Great American Songbook</i> with him?

29:56.002 --> 29:56.961
Yes, with him.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.254
- As a producer?
- Yes.

29:58.922 --> 30:01.424
Three albums, the three classics:

30:01.508 --> 30:04.385
Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.137
<i>Romance,</i> but in English.

30:10.558 --> 30:11.392
What--?

30:11.476 --> 30:14.938
How the hell did you get
an appointment with David Foster?

30:16.606 --> 30:18.233
A couple of calls, no big deal.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.695
And I represent
the best singer in the world.

30:36.459 --> 30:37.377
Holy shit!

30:39.045 --> 30:42.215
Record it and the sky's the limit, Micky.

30:43.216 --> 30:44.259
Just like that.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.480
Julio...

31:00.066 --> 31:03.361
I think it's pretty clear
I can sing the album, right?

31:05.905 --> 31:07.115
I believe it is, Micky.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.830
Well, let's pick the songs!

31:14.747 --> 31:16.833
- All right, it's settled.
- Great.

31:18.001 --> 31:18.960
Okay.

31:19.043 --> 31:19.878
Good.

31:20.378 --> 31:23.506
Hey, I'll call you
to talk about the details, okay?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.425
- Okay.
- It was a pleasure seeing you.

31:25.508 --> 31:26.593
- This way?
- Of course.

31:26.676 --> 31:29.512
- Bye.
- Hey, walk him to the door.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.649
You should've seen his face
when he saw you sing.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.904
I think we can make him ask
for a smaller cut.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.113
Well, I hope so.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.198
It's the last time I sing in a <i>palenque.</i>

31:50.408 --> 31:51.367
I'm done.

31:53.494 --> 31:55.747
You planned this all along, didn't you?

31:56.873 --> 31:59.375
You were waiting
for the album deal to come through

31:59.459 --> 32:01.753
to cancel the <i>palenques,</i> weren't you?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.007
What do you think?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.109
I went back

33:06.734 --> 33:08.528
and Foster was thrilled.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.196
Well done, cousin.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.908
I don't get why you didn't tell me.
Why the mystery?

33:13.992 --> 33:15.368
Why tell you?

33:15.451 --> 33:17.120
The deal wasn't closed yet.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.872
But, is Micky coming to sign tomorrow?

33:19.956 --> 33:21.249
Yes, for sure.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.752
Luckily, he dumped the movie.

33:25.795 --> 33:26.671
Great.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.215
Hey,

33:29.716 --> 33:33.136
I need Karla to get in touch
with Foster's office tomorrow.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.637
- Okay?
- Yeah, sure.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.142
Well played, cousin,
I still can't believe it.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.438
We make a great team, man.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.696
I just don't get it.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.449
You should be ecstatic.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.784
I've been crunching numbers, Miguel.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.079
Even if we renegotiate
the contract with Warner,

34:00.830 --> 34:02.165
the album would be a risk.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.919
I mean, if we sell, we settle
all the debts, but if we don't sell...

34:10.006 --> 34:11.674
Then, he should do more concerts.

34:13.676 --> 34:14.761
He doesn't want to.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.681
He won't do more concerts
until the album is out.

34:19.265 --> 34:22.560
And that could take a while,
one, two, three years, who knows?

34:23.060 --> 34:24.687
And the debt with Brockhaus

34:24.771 --> 34:26.564
needs to be settled this year.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.149
There's no time left.

34:30.943 --> 34:34.030
Listen, the album
will come out soon, he'll do well.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.281
He's Micky.

34:35.823 --> 34:39.368
Yeah. It's clear to all of us
Luis Miguel will keep singing,

34:39.452 --> 34:41.579
but for years,
he's only been in the papers

34:41.662 --> 34:43.456
for lawsuits and scandals.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.749
But people love him.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.961
I mean, they grew up with him,

34:49.045 --> 34:51.798
they've been listening
to his music almost 40 years.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.593
The issue here is how they see him today.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.388
And let's be honest,

35:00.014 --> 35:01.766
no one sees this Luis Miguel

35:01.849 --> 35:04.769
and sees the youngster
that sang "Cuando Calienta el Sol."

35:09.190 --> 35:11.943
I think there's a way
I can solve this problem...

35:19.242 --> 35:20.868
but Micky will hate it.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.606
The place looks great.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.402
You always had good taste.

38:03.322 --> 38:06.534
Weren't you in LA working
as somebody's manager?

38:08.202 --> 38:09.078
I was,

38:10.496 --> 38:12.456
but I came and I felt like seeing you.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.084
And,

38:16.377 --> 38:17.795
I was just with your dad.

38:24.969 --> 38:25.803
Okay.

38:27.638 --> 38:28.848
In case you care,

38:29.932 --> 38:31.434
he's recording a new album.

38:33.686 --> 38:34.979
Good for him.

38:40.693 --> 38:41.527
Damn it!

38:42.778 --> 38:45.948
You're as pigheaded as you used to be.
You haven't changed.

38:49.118 --> 38:49.952
Michelle--

38:50.036 --> 38:50.870
Please.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.123
Tell me you're not here to talk about him.

38:54.957 --> 38:56.709
That's exactly why I'm here.

38:58.836 --> 38:59.795
To talk about him.

39:01.213 --> 39:02.673
Michelle, your dad is lonely.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.760
I'd say lonelier than ever.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.222
To top it off, I think he's in trouble.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.852
Don't you think it's time you talked?

39:16.812 --> 39:18.981
Actually, he's the one
who won't talk to me.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.317
You know why?

39:23.611 --> 39:24.862
Because he's scared.

39:27.239 --> 39:28.991
And I think you are too,

39:29.658 --> 39:30.576
a little.

39:32.328 --> 39:33.162
Okay.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.042
I guess you're forgetting

39:39.168 --> 39:40.586
how he treated us.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.634
Man, it was--

39:47.885 --> 39:50.346
It was horrible.
When he found out about us--

39:51.847 --> 39:54.517
I don't know. Don't you
remember how he spoke to you?

39:55.309 --> 39:57.144
How he kicked me out?

39:57.228 --> 39:58.312
Of course I remember.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.524
I remember how bad it was for us.

40:03.317 --> 40:06.570
Michelle, no one in the world
will get you better than me, no one.

40:08.906 --> 40:09.990
But life passes by.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.411
You'll both regret this.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.123
You don't get me.

40:20.459 --> 40:22.086
I won't ever seek him out again.

40:25.339 --> 40:26.215
Never.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.219
Okay?

40:50.197 --> 40:51.949
Is this advance payment really true?

40:52.533 --> 40:53.409
Nice, huh?

40:53.993 --> 40:55.244
Delicious.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.913
Hey, when is Foster signing?

40:57.997 --> 41:00.332
I'm taking him the papers to LA tomorrow.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.294
When will we discuss
the song selection with him?

41:03.377 --> 41:05.129
Does this week work for you?

41:07.423 --> 41:10.301
- And this one too, Micky.
- What is that?

41:11.135 --> 41:14.930
More confidentiality agreements.
You know gringos.

41:15.014 --> 41:17.308
- Fuck, they love this kind of stuff.
- Here.

41:22.104 --> 41:25.441
- Have you read it?
- Of course, Micky, every comma.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.526
Everything's in order, don't worry.

41:33.782 --> 41:34.783
Hey, not bad.

41:35.367 --> 41:37.870
- Finally. Well done, man.
-"Finally"?

41:37.953 --> 41:40.414
This is weird. We should celebrate.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.250
- See you, Mau.
- You don't see everything I do here.

41:59.892 --> 42:00.726
Done.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.855
Kudos, cousin. Everything turned out okay.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.194
What is this, Foster's contract?

42:11.445 --> 42:12.488
No, cousin.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.824
It isn't Foster's contract.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.244
Open it on page nine.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.126
Is this legal?

42:28.462 --> 42:30.047
One hundred percent.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.301
You're talking to the new owner of Aries.

42:45.437 --> 42:46.814
Miguel, how are you?

42:47.731 --> 42:48.816
What's up?

42:49.733 --> 42:51.026
Come in.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.069
Fucking great.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.238
You look great.

42:55.739 --> 42:56.574
How's it going?

42:56.657 --> 42:59.410
Great. What drink should I pour you?

42:59.493 --> 43:01.036
What are you drinking?

43:01.120 --> 43:02.246
Some wine.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.789
That's swell.

43:04.707 --> 43:05.749
There you go.

43:10.379 --> 43:11.505
Is everything okay?

43:12.006 --> 43:14.091
- Well, yes.
- I'm glad.

43:15.676 --> 43:16.635
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:18.512 --> 43:19.930
- Sit.
- Yes.

43:23.350 --> 43:24.602
This is delicious.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.020
Really good, man.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.772
Okay, tell me.
You said you had a business proposal.

43:30.065 --> 43:33.110
Well, first of all,
I spoke with Garduño, he insists--

43:33.193 --> 43:35.654
That the album won't be enough.

43:35.738 --> 43:36.572
That's it.

43:36.655 --> 43:38.157
He's such a drag.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.158
Well.

43:40.909 --> 43:42.870
You know I'm partnering with--

43:43.621 --> 43:46.874
With a group that's doing cinema, TV--

43:46.957 --> 43:47.875
No!

43:49.084 --> 43:52.546
No, I'm not acting.

43:52.629 --> 43:55.215
<i>El Zorro</i> was
my almost first and last time.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.718
Don't worry, no one wants you to act,

43:57.801 --> 43:58.886
you're not that good.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.641
What we want to do is

44:05.100 --> 44:06.435
a series about you.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.033
A series about

44:21.909 --> 44:22.868
your life,

44:23.827 --> 44:24.745
about Luis Miguel.

44:31.293 --> 44:32.670
A series about me?

49:43.939 --> 49:49.152
