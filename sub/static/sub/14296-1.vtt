00:43.210 --> 00:46.635
<i>Monday... Monday, go away
and come again another day</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:48.632
<i>I'm sick and tired of Tuesdays.</i>

00:48.799 --> 00:50.221
<i>Wednesday's good for bad.</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:53.729
<i>Sitting in the office
on a wet 'n' windy Thursday.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:55.305
<i>Warm 'n' dead on Friday</i>

00:55.597 --> 00:58.567
<i>I don't wanna live, day to go.</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:02.028
<i>Oh, don'tcha know.</i>

01:02.938 --> 01:05.612
<i>Oh, don'tcha know.</i>

01:07.609 --> 01:10.488
<i>Hard to get.</i>

01:11.113 --> 01:14.162
<i>Hard to get.</i>

01:14.741 --> 01:17.870
<i>Hard to get.</i>

01:18.537 --> 01:21.086
<i>Uh-huh-huh.</i>

01:21.415 --> 01:23.167
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:44.229 --> 01:46.152
<i>You can get it.</i>

01:47.858 --> 01:49.656
<i>If you lose it.</i>

01:51.445 --> 01:53.118
<i>But don't forget.</i>

01:54.406 --> 01:56.875
<i>Uh-huh-huh.</i>

01:58.577 --> 01:59.577
<i>Oh.</i>

01:59.745 --> 02:01.329
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

02:01.330 --> 02:04.334
<i>Hard to get.</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:07.924
<i>Hard to get.</i>

02:08.336 --> 02:11.762
<i>Hard to get.</i>

02:12.507 --> 02:14.805
<i>Uh-huh-huh.</i>

02:16.511 --> 02:17.720
<i>Ooh.</i>

02:17.721 --> 02:19.263
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:22.564
<i>Hard to get.</i>

02:22.893 --> 02:26.067
<i>Hard to get.</i>

02:26.480 --> 02:29.950
<i>Hard to get.</i>

02:30.317 --> 02:32.777
<i>Uh-huh-huh.</i>

02:32.778 --> 02:34.826
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

02:41.578 --> 02:43.546
<i>You can get it.</i>

02:45.123 --> 02:47.125
<i>If you lose it.</i>

02:48.585 --> 02:50.804
<i>Then don't forget.</i>

02:51.630 --> 02:54.133
<i>Uh-huh-huh.</i>

02:56.009 --> 02:57.051
<i>Oh</i>

03:30.001 --> 03:30.921
Yes?

03:30.922 --> 03:32.260
Yeah, I saw your sign out front.

03:32.261 --> 03:34.261
And I was wondering
if I could see the guest house.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.340
Well actually,
I just got out here.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.842
But you do work mostly at home?

03:37.843 --> 03:41.512
Uh-huh. I really need
the peace and quiet.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.478
This is so great.

03:42.479 --> 03:43.562
You see, I'm always in court.

03:43.563 --> 03:45.275
My husband Cliff complains
he spends more time

03:45.276 --> 03:46.519
in airports than at home.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.022
We'd both... feel better
if there was someone around.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.573
I'll take it.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.574
Great.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.370
Now, it's... it's a little run-down
on the inside,

04:04.371 --> 04:06.584
but there's plenty of spare furniture
in the garage.

04:06.585 --> 04:08.878
You're welcome to help yourself
to anything you'd like.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.299
That's my daughter, Adrian.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.842
Oh, I think we met...

04:15.380 --> 04:17.339
out front on the street.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.382
Oh.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.009
She seemed very, uh...

04:20.010 --> 04:22.263
Headstrong is what I call it.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.521
But I'm sure you two
will get along fine.

05:14.523 --> 05:15.898
<i>Just like a toy</i>

05:15.899 --> 05:18.743
<i>I was waitin' for you.</i>

05:19.027 --> 05:20.370
<i>But you never came.</i>

05:20.737 --> 05:23.113
<i>And I found myself alone...</i>

05:23.114 --> 05:25.116
- Hello.
- Get down.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.492
What's the big deal?

05:26.493 --> 05:28.038
My parents rented out
the guest house.

05:28.039 --> 05:28.958
To who?

05:28.959 --> 05:30.126
Some guy.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.331
Look, check him out.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.333
If you're not back in five minutes,
I'll radio for air support.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.334
Okay.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.379
<i>I waited for you.</i>

05:38.380 --> 05:40.007
<i>But you never came.</i>

05:41.925 --> 05:45.475
<i>On the way back to my house</i>

05:45.846 --> 05:46.938
<i>I had to hesitate.</i>

05:47.639 --> 05:48.639
Who goes there?

05:48.640 --> 05:50.015
What?

05:50.016 --> 05:52.394
Identify yourself.
Friend or foe?

05:53.144 --> 05:54.396
Depends.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.028
<i>Some time today...</i>

05:57.399 --> 05:58.821
You got a name?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.618
Cheyenne.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.987
Oh, Injun, huh?

06:02.988 --> 06:03.988
Hippie parents.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.699
Oh.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.575
Later.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.544
<i>Should I speak.</i>

06:09.911 --> 06:11.913
<i>When I saw that man?</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:14.003
<i>I think I saw that face</i>

06:14.249 --> 06:17.173
<i>I would like to give you more.</i>

06:18.587 --> 06:22.057
<i>I heard that's what
we're all here for.</i>

06:22.757 --> 06:24.384
Well?

06:25.594 --> 06:27.722
Well, he's okay.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.640
Kind of cool.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.099
Old.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.864
Hi. I'm Nick Eliot.
I'm here to see Michael.

06:44.865 --> 06:46.581
Nick Eliot?
You're late.

06:47.032 --> 06:50.036
- It's not even 8:30.
- Monday meeting starts at 8:15.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.595
What I'm concerned about
is the focus on this.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.929
Go on.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.978
You've got to do it.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.535
- Good eye.
- Good.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.149
Oh, okay, what are you
working on right now?

07:17.150 --> 07:19.944
Oh, I'm still
researching the article.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.776
New here?

07:26.196 --> 07:27.823
I can tell.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.250
All right.
Let's get down to business.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.243
Tanya Terrel on the cover.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.878
If she wants to expose herself
and her body,

07:33.879 --> 07:35.122
I'll be happy to oblige her.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.456
I need more pictures inside,
but keep the text

07:37.457 --> 07:38.800
under 1,000 words.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.670
The Senate arms deal is dead.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.176
Nobody cares, and the weeklies
are beating it to death.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.892
Now, Nicholas Eliot,

07:47.175 --> 07:49.972
Monday's staff meetings
begin at 8:15 precisely.

07:49.973 --> 07:51.597
I expect everyone to be here.

07:51.598 --> 07:53.889
Oh, ahem, my apologies.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.938
I, uh, just got into town.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.524
Do you really think I don't know
who you are, Mr. Eliot?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.777
Your former superiors describe you

08:01.778 --> 08:04.274
as an excellent researcher
with only fair writing skills.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.242
In fact, one of them,
described you

08:05.243 --> 08:06.908
as a pit bull
when you're on the scent.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.993
And that's precisely why I hired you.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.040
Now, Mr. Eliot...

08:11.282 --> 08:13.660
tell me, what do you know
about Robert Levansky?

08:14.703 --> 08:17.707
Only that he just got out of jail
and refuses to talk to the press.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.458
He embezzled almost $2 billion,

08:19.459 --> 08:22.209
500 million of which
remains unaccounted for.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.006
I want you to dig up
everything you can.

08:24.007 --> 08:26.553
Come on, 1,000 reporters
have been on that for months.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.385
It's a black hole.

08:28.386 --> 08:30.260
I'll expect something by Friday.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.177
Maddik, track Eliot.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.846
If he finds anything,
I want pictures.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.847
Mr. Hurley.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.025
Is he always like this?

08:38.027 --> 08:40.059
Sometimes he's in a bad mood.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.061
Oh.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.704
<i>And every day.</i>

08:50.030 --> 08:51.657
<i>Must I...</i>

08:52.574 --> 08:55.919
<i>wait on you hand and foot?</i>

08:57.203 --> 09:00.377
<i>On the way past, I...</i>

09:01.624 --> 09:05.345
<i>One time when you made me
feel so good...</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:07.680
So how much they paying you
to watch me?

09:07.681 --> 09:09.299
<i>Ribbons in your hair...</i>

09:09.549 --> 09:10.971
Just renting the guest house.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.392
<i>- They were never there.
- Oh.</i>

09:15.305 --> 09:17.848
<i>It's not a subscription...</i>

09:17.849 --> 09:19.271
Why are you doing that?

09:19.601 --> 09:20.601
Well...

09:22.228 --> 09:24.588
I'm gonna have her painted
now that I can finally afford it.

09:27.776 --> 09:31.320
So, uh... Fox hunt?
Polo?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.948
No. I'm schooling jumpers.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.917
I'm gonna be the youngest
in my class to go to Nationals.

09:35.918 --> 09:38.253
Really? Sounds ambitious.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.080
Yeah, well...

09:40.997 --> 09:44.672
if only my ride would show,
maybe I could get to practice.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.924
<i>This one will never mend.</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:51.763
<i>To show before a friend.</i>

09:52.300 --> 09:53.802
Hello. Mario Analdi?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.928
Hi. Nick Eliot.
<i>Pique</i> magazine.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.021
I was wondering if you
might be able to answer

09:57.022 --> 09:58.435
a few questions for us.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.145
You used to work
for the Levansky family,

10:00.146 --> 10:01.438
is that right?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.202
I think we have something.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.270
Yes.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.799
Very attractive.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.674
Oh, this?

10:33.174 --> 10:34.426
Helps me think.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.176
Hmm.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.888
Come in, come in.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.401
So what are you doing?

10:44.402 --> 10:46.772
Ooh, pretty dry stuff, really.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.072
You wouldn't be interested.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.116
Try me.

10:52.527 --> 10:53.527
Okay.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.330
Uh... you ever hear
of Robert Levansky?

10:57.115 --> 10:59.334
The arbitrage guy
who stole a lot of money.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.377
Allegedly stole.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.540
Uh, anyway, I found his chauffeur.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.211
He told me that he regularly
drove Levansky

11:08.212 --> 11:09.756
up to a house in Knollwood.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.462
Seems Levansky had a...

11:12.463 --> 11:13.931
a friend.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.932
You mean a lover?

11:26.561 --> 11:28.484
Well, yeah, yeah.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.233
Yes, um...

11:32.108 --> 11:34.860
Anyway, it turns out
this woman flew to Geneva

11:34.861 --> 11:35.906
six times last year.

11:35.907 --> 11:38.908
Ooh, Swiss bank accounts loaded
with the missing cash.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.465
You sure you're only 14?

11:48.082 --> 11:49.925
Almost 15.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.218
Isn't it way past your bedtime?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.269
YES.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.472
Uh-huh.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.520
Um...

12:05.892 --> 12:08.270
So, um... whose pool?

12:09.562 --> 12:13.112
That's Rockford's.
They're in Maine.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.031
Guess they keep it
lit up for burglars.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.988
Now, who would want
to steal a pool?

12:56.985 --> 12:58.068
Hello?

12:58.069 --> 12:59.537
Hi!

13:03.283 --> 13:04.626
You know, most people knock.

13:04.627 --> 13:06.836
I did. You didn't hear.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.624
Is this you?

13:12.625 --> 13:16.003
Mm-hmm. That is me
and David Cummings.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.170
Who?

13:17.171 --> 13:18.263
Dave Cummings!

13:18.923 --> 13:20.883
He's one of the great reporters
of his generation.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.426
One time or another,
he had a byline

13:22.427 --> 13:24.179
in every paper
across the country.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.226
He was also my grandfather.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.229
You were so cute.
Can I have it?

13:29.559 --> 13:30.811
It's the only one I have.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.446
- Please?
- No.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.613
You always write on a computer?

13:42.071 --> 13:43.071
I'd be lost without it.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.370
Makes you wonder
how your grandfather got along.

13:46.371 --> 13:49.041
Then, again, he wasn't writing
for trendy magazines, was he?

13:49.042 --> 13:50.209
Ha ha ha.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.045
Now, will you get out of here
and let me get dressed?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.722
I got you something.

14:08.723 --> 14:09.723
Oh, yeah?

14:11.392 --> 14:12.439
What?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.358
Open it and find out.

14:15.653 --> 14:16.653
Wow.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.488
Cool.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.237
Thank you, Adrian.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.121
Now I'm late.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.284
Um, you're going to come
to my parents' party

14:27.285 --> 14:28.580
on Saturday night, aren't you?

14:28.581 --> 14:30.577
Uh, I don't know, Adrian.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.167
My mother invited you,
didn't she?

14:32.168 --> 14:34.289
Yeah, but I have a lot of work.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.291
Please, it's going to be
all of Mom's boring old friends.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.339
I'll try.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.503
Not good enough.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.264
I said I'll try.
Now let me go.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.970
Pretty please?

14:44.258 --> 14:45.384
Out!

14:53.226 --> 14:54.267
Damn.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.348
- Hey, is that your article?
- Yeah, it just came in.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.938
Great.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.941
Will you two come on?
Michael's waiting.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.489
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.368
There's something
very wrong here.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.039
Good work, Maddik.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.040
Thank you.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.252
Hid in the rose bushes two hours
to get that money shot.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.253
Mm-hmm.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.011
Um, Michael, I was wondering
if I might have a chance

15:24.012 --> 15:25.508
to go over that before you read it.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.384
I think, maybe one
of the copy editors...

15:27.385 --> 15:29.433
The editors haven't touched it.
The article's fine as it stands.

15:29.434 --> 15:31.268
Samantha, get this
to the art department.

15:31.269 --> 15:32.766
We're resetting the whole issue.

15:32.767 --> 15:34.349
You got the cover, Maddik.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.818
I think you owe it
to your friend here.

15:35.819 --> 15:38.188
All right!
Thank you, sir.

15:39.484 --> 15:41.858
<i>Michael, Mr. Siegal's office
is holding on line six.</i>

15:42.775 --> 15:43.775
Eliot...

15:44.735 --> 15:46.611
Not only is your research
excellent,

15:46.612 --> 15:48.990
but your text is clean, concise.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.125
You even have some style.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.286
Thank you.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.018
What the hell.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.632
Hi.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.180
Hi.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.639
Oh, Nick!

16:55.848 --> 16:57.769
Nick, I'm so glad
you could make it.

16:57.770 --> 16:59.485
Honey, honey, this is Nick.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.817
Nick, this is my husband
Cliff Forrester.

17:01.979 --> 17:02.855
Hello.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.481
My wife speaks
very highly of you.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.527
How's everything out back?

17:05.528 --> 17:06.694
Oh, well, it's great, sir.

17:06.695 --> 17:07.818
You have a beautiful place.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.528
Thank you. You enjoy it.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.449
Thank you.

17:10.450 --> 17:12.089
Honey, honey, look,
there are the Mortons.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.746
Oh, my God, I think she's
had her eyes done.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.078
Oh, yeah, Saperstein did her eyes
five years ago.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.079
No.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.665
No, it's her breasts
I was wondering about.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.212
Excuse us, Nick.
Come on.

17:24.213 --> 17:25.507
Hang in there, Nick.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.108
Excuse me.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.975
That was lovely, Adrian.

18:21.976 --> 18:22.976
Thank you.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.660
Thanks.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.785
I knew you'd come.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.333
I tell you, if you were
10 years older...

18:38.334 --> 18:39.794
You'd what?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.548
So, how did your boss
like the article?

18:45.916 --> 18:46.916
It was you?

18:47.335 --> 18:48.460
You rewrote it?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.586
Hi, Mr. Fogel!

18:49.587 --> 18:50.587
Hello, Adrian!

18:51.714 --> 18:52.954
Wait a minute?
How'd you get in?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.387
It ain't Fort Knox.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.306
Adrian, you can't do that.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.629
It worked, though, didn't it?

18:58.179 --> 18:59.681
Poor Nick.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.191
You have such a terrible time
with the objective case,

19:02.558 --> 19:05.528
and your split infinitives
put such a stress on the adverb.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.239
Adrian, you just can't
go around doing that.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.527
It isn't right.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.663
I just wanted you to like me.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.119
Of course I like you.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.159
Then, take me for a ride
in the Valiant.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.460
Now?

19:21.461 --> 19:22.827
Yeah, just for a little while.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.188
There's a place
I want to show you.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.049
I... I don't know.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.671
Please?

19:52.817 --> 19:54.239
Come on, I want to show you.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.532
Adrian!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.808
Beautiful, isn't it?

20:24.765 --> 20:26.358
Yeah, it is.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.645
Look, I'm sorry
about the article,

20:29.854 --> 20:31.856
and I won't do it again.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.402
Look, I know I'm not
the world's greatest writer,

20:35.403 --> 20:38.075
but, uh... believe me,

20:38.237 --> 20:41.958
it's... hard to take being bettered
by a 14-year-old kid.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.003
It's okay, really.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.422
No, it's not.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.256
You don't know how hard it is
for me to make friends.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.513
I mean, my parents made me skip
two grades in school.

20:58.850 --> 21:02.061
My only friend is Cheyenne,
and it's only because...

21:02.511 --> 21:05.060
Well, my mom and her mom
went to college together,

21:05.061 --> 21:07.478
so... she kind of has to.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.565
It's like everybody thinks

21:10.566 --> 21:13.440
I'm some kind of freak
or something, like I'm crazy.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.488
Hey, hey.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.695
Come on.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.696
We can be friends.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.782
You don't have to.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.830
I know I don't have to.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.996
It's not a "have to"
kind of thing.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.548
That's better.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.970
Please don't be afraid of me.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.153
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

21:52.154 --> 21:53.270
What?

21:54.355 --> 21:55.902
What?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.242
We got to go.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.619
Nick!

22:01.445 --> 22:03.413
Come on, come on.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.054
Good night, darlin'.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.764
Good night.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.608
I love you, Mommy.

23:18.856 --> 23:19.776
<i>You can taste that.</i>

23:19.777 --> 23:20.777
<i>If you want.</i>

23:21.108 --> 23:22.530
<i>Mmm.</i>

23:23.193 --> 23:24.240
<i>You can taste that.</i>

23:24.241 --> 23:25.328
<i>If you want.</i>

23:25.821 --> 23:27.739
<i>Mmm.</i>

23:27.740 --> 23:29.913
<i>You can taste that if you want.</i>

23:32.536 --> 23:33.503
<i>You can taste that.</i>

23:33.504 --> 23:34.667
<i>If you want.</i>

23:34.872 --> 23:35.998
<i>Mmm.</i>

23:36.957 --> 23:38.004
<i>You can taste that.</i>

23:38.005 --> 23:39.217
<i>If you want.</i>

23:39.376 --> 23:40.798
<i>Mmm.</i>

23:41.462 --> 23:42.964
<i>You can taste that if you want</i>

23:55.559 --> 23:57.653
Nicholas, darling!

23:58.187 --> 24:00.406
Oh, hi, Adrian.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.118
This is my friend Amy.

24:04.119 --> 24:06.282
- Hi.
- My landlord's kid.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.906
Hi.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.454
See ya.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.831
"Nicholas"?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.539
My "darling"?

24:18.332 --> 24:19.332
Wow.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.968
<i>Baby, can't you see...</i>

24:29.760 --> 24:31.219
- Nick?
- Yeah?

24:31.220 --> 24:33.393
- You won't believe who's here.
- Who?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.267
Oh, my God.

24:36.850 --> 24:37.850
Michael!

24:37.851 --> 24:39.273
Hi.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.484
Jeez, I... I thought you knew
it was a barbecue.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.608
Eliot, I wanted to tell you
personally.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.569
I've been on the phone all morning
with the lawyers.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.379
Robert Levansky
wants to speak with you.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.363
You're kidding.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.204
I'm setting up a meeting.
It'll be an exclusive.

24:51.205 --> 24:52.645
And he's making you
part of the deal.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.081
Very good.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.161
But why?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.562
I don't know.
Frankly, I don't care.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.314
I suppose he saw something
in the article that impressed him.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.214
Ah, yes.
Um... here.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.544
A gift.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.639
Oh... thank you.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.933
That's a very fine bottle of wine.

25:10.384 --> 25:12.057
I'd let it breathe
for at least an hour.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.186
As you were.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.568
"As you were"?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.146
Well, uh...

25:22.479 --> 25:24.152
wine and marshmallows, anyone?

25:24.153 --> 25:26.816
- Yay!
- Yeah!

25:26.817 --> 25:29.036
Here. We need some sticks.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.455
Okay. I'll scout the orchard.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.056
Ow.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.565
Fuck.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.953
Hi.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.327
You scared me.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.958
What are you doing?

26:21.538 --> 26:22.538
Um...

26:22.956 --> 26:25.300
Sticks for marshmallows, you know?

26:25.626 --> 26:26.923
But those bees.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.504
Wasps.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.338
Yellowjackets...

26:30.923 --> 26:32.049
Genus Vespula.

26:32.466 --> 26:33.683
They all sting.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.516
Bees won't bother you
unless you bother them.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.392
Wasps are different.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.145
They're territorial,
and they're social.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.193
Social?

26:43.727 --> 26:45.229
Like they want to be friends?

26:45.813 --> 26:47.656
Like they attack in groups.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.859
We should leave.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.239
Slowly.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.539
Slowly.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.203
Slowly.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.050
Hey, looks like Nick
made a friend.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.712
God, she's so pretty.
She's like a model.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.927
If you like that kind of thing.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.382
Oh, don't worry, Amy.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.223
Some guys really like girls
with small breasts.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.414
What's with your friend Adrian?

27:22.683 --> 27:23.434
What do you mean?

27:23.600 --> 27:24.911
I thought you guys
were hitting it off.

27:24.935 --> 27:28.405
Yeah. I know,
but she gives me the creeps.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.076
She's just a kid.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.206
She's got a crush on you.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.491
Don't be silly.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.118
<i>Hi. It's me.</i>

27:42.119 --> 27:43.332
<i>Just thinking of you.</i>

27:43.333 --> 27:44.829
<i>God, that sounds corny.</i>

27:44.830 --> 27:46.673
<i>Oh, well, call me
when you get a sec, okay?</i>

27:46.674 --> 27:48.332
<i>Oh, say hi to Amy. Bye.</i>

27:49.293 --> 27:51.512
Look, Nick, I've been there.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.965
You have to be the adult.
You can't blur the line.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.420
What, are you saying I did
something to provoke this?

27:58.302 --> 27:59.519
Well, did you?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.097
No. Of course not.

28:17.905 --> 28:18.872
Hello?

28:18.873 --> 28:19.989
Miss me?

28:19.990 --> 28:21.333
<i>Uh, hello, Adrian.</i>

28:21.992 --> 28:24.086
What ya doin'?

28:24.578 --> 28:26.249
<i>What do you think I'm doin'?</i>

28:26.250 --> 28:27.748
<i>What am I always doin'?</i>

28:28.165 --> 28:29.332
I'm workin'.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.210
Aw, Nick. Can't you
come out and play?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.963
No, Adrian.
I'm under deadline.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.052
<i>Guess what.</i>

28:36.548 --> 28:37.845
What?

28:39.468 --> 28:40.720
Got my period.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.972
<i>I'm definitely not pregnant.</i>

28:44.556 --> 28:46.183
Not that I had any reason to be.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.059
Adrian...

28:48.393 --> 28:49.485
Yeah?

28:50.979 --> 28:52.026
Did you take my picture,

28:52.689 --> 28:54.566
<i>the one of me
and my grandfather?</i>

28:54.775 --> 28:57.904
No. Why would I do that?

28:59.029 --> 29:00.029
All right.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.450
I'll talk to you later.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.392
Adrian!

29:44.533 --> 29:46.251
Hello?

30:06.888 --> 30:08.890
Anybody home?

34:18.431 --> 34:19.431
Cliff.

34:19.641 --> 34:20.641
Hi.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.935
Nick, well, uh...

34:22.936 --> 34:23.936
What are you doing here?

34:23.937 --> 34:25.029
Oh, you mean, here?

34:25.563 --> 34:26.777
Well, I was just, uh...

34:26.777 --> 34:28.696
returning a book to Adrian.
She's upstairs.

34:28.858 --> 34:29.984
Oh.

34:30.527 --> 34:33.451
So, anyway,
I... I really got to get going.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.489
- Nick.
- Yeah.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.570
Could you give me a hand
getting this stuff upstairs?

34:37.826 --> 34:39.920
I don't think my back's
going to make it.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.579
Well, I...

34:41.580 --> 34:42.739
Oh, it'll just take a minute.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.500
Sure appreciate it.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.922
You are a pal.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.742
Uh, careful there, my man.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.912
I don't need any lawsuits.
You know what I mean?

35:24.331 --> 35:26.004
My little restoration project.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.768
It's, um...

35:38.553 --> 35:39.679
really something.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.263
Yeah.

35:41.681 --> 35:44.275
I had it shipped out here
from a carnival in Kansas

35:44.276 --> 35:46.235
right after Adrian was born.

35:46.811 --> 35:50.987
Dragged every damn piece up here,
one at a time.

35:52.817 --> 35:53.989
Want to see it work?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.620
Sure.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.035
Well, the motor's kind of old,
you know?

36:03.036 --> 36:05.789
It takes a little while
to get up to speed.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.462
Anyway...

36:14.386 --> 36:16.224
You get the idea.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.597
Plan was to turn this whole attic

36:19.598 --> 36:22.689
into a kind of playroom,
you know, for Adrian.

36:23.807 --> 36:27.152
The only problem was...
she never took to it.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.112
Now I can't get
the damn thing down.

36:30.814 --> 36:33.237
You know, Nick, Adrian's a...

36:33.733 --> 36:34.859
very special girl.

36:35.318 --> 36:38.037
Mm-hmm. She's, um...
She's very bright.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.291
This past year,
she's really, uh...

36:41.292 --> 36:43.159
blossomed...

36:43.576 --> 36:44.623
Physically, I mean.

36:44.624 --> 36:46.371
Mmm. I noticed.

36:53.503 --> 36:55.796
You know, I swear to God,
not a night goes by

36:55.797 --> 36:56.719
I don't lay awake

36:56.720 --> 36:58.507
dreading that knock on the door.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.188
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.390
Not really.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.018
Oh, some friggin' kid
will be standing there

37:04.019 --> 37:07.313
with his hard-on
sticking out his pants.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.237
Hope I don't go breaking it off.

37:15.525 --> 37:16.525
Heh.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.489
Yeah.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.788
- Hi, Daddy.
- Huh? Oh, hi, sweetheart.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.274
We were just talking about you.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.374
Hi.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.710
You scared me.
I didn't know who was up here.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.841
Ah, I was just showing Nick
your carousel.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.547
It's your carousel, Dad.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.428
Remember,
I ride real horses now?

37:38.882 --> 37:41.510
Well, I really ought to get going.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.596
Oh, Adrian, what book
did you loan Nick?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.110
Book?

37:52.812 --> 37:53.938
Oh.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.240
Well, that must have been
<i>Wuthering</i> Heights.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.113
Did you like it?

38:02.113 --> 38:03.114
YES.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.073
Very much.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.041
Hmm.

38:06.042 --> 38:07.454
<i>Wuthering Heights,</i> huh?

38:07.455 --> 38:08.624
Sounds a little femme to me.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.163
Anyway, I...

38:12.041 --> 38:14.008
I really ought to go.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.839
Bye, Nick.
Thanks for returning the book.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.908
Hi.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.326
Can I talk to you a sec?

38:48.827 --> 38:49.792
Sorry?

38:49.793 --> 38:51.073
I was wondering
if we could talk.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.922
What do you want to talk about?

38:53.581 --> 38:54.833
Well, um...

38:55.917 --> 38:58.921
I don't know. To tell you the truth,
it's... it's a little awkward.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.422
Uh...

39:02.841 --> 39:04.935
Would you mind stopping that?

39:05.760 --> 39:06.852
Why?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.273
Never mind.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.564
I hardly know where to begin.

39:18.982 --> 39:21.781
I... I guess what I want
to say is...

39:22.861 --> 39:24.738
I really like you, Adrian.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.948
I really like you, too.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.452
No, I... I mean, as a friend.

39:31.870 --> 39:35.340
I mean, let's face it.
You're 14. I'm 28.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.626
That's a big difference.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.132
Whatever you say.

39:40.461 --> 39:44.557
No. No. Seriously, Adrian.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.436
Now, I want you to know
you can count on me.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.724
I'll always be your friend,
no matter what, okay?

39:52.724 --> 39:53.932
Okay.

39:53.933 --> 39:57.233
Like that night up at the lighthouse
when we kissed?

39:59.480 --> 40:01.733
Now, that was a mistake, Adrian.

40:02.442 --> 40:05.366
Was sneaking in to watch me
undress a mistake, too?

40:07.864 --> 40:09.332
<i>Hmm?</i>

40:14.787 --> 40:16.209
Nick...

40:17.123 --> 40:18.340
Ever do a virgin?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.047
What?

40:20.710 --> 40:21.710
I know you want to.

40:22.462 --> 40:23.462
Now, look.

40:23.796 --> 40:25.469
Let's avoid any confusion here!

40:25.757 --> 40:27.179
I'm gonna make this
very simple for you.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.139
You're...
You're too young for me!

40:29.140 --> 40:30.728
There's nothing between us!
Nothing!

40:37.393 --> 40:38.485
Hmm.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.202
Wait till you see this.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.787
I can't believe
you bought me a car.

40:56.788 --> 40:57.708
I didn't.

40:57.709 --> 40:59.503
It's not going to make me feel
any different about you.

40:59.504 --> 41:01.126
Really, I didn't buy you a car.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.251
Then, what's the surprise?

41:02.418 --> 41:03.635
Wait right here.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.592
Okay. Grab an end.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.804
<i>- You ready?
- Ooh, never been so ready.</i>

41:16.724 --> 41:17.724
Huh?

41:17.809 --> 41:19.857
Check it out.
Factory paint.

41:20.103 --> 41:22.067
I got matching vinyl interior.

41:22.068 --> 41:23.906
This is one of the finest
pieces of iron

41:23.907 --> 41:26.651
ever came out of Detroit.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.580
Sugar?

41:47.880 --> 41:49.132
Well, um...

41:49.549 --> 41:52.175
if you didn't, uh,
actually see her...

41:52.176 --> 41:53.719
Is that right?

41:53.720 --> 41:55.438
Well, no, I didn't actually
see her.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.645
So you're not absolutely certain.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.194
Well, no, I'm...
not absolutely.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.992
But... But I do feel...

42:08.151 --> 42:10.119
But I... I just...

42:10.570 --> 42:13.198
I just feel very strongly
that she did this.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.286
Mm-hm.

42:14.287 --> 42:16.535
Hi. I'm going out with Cheyenne.

42:16.784 --> 42:17.784
Hi, Nick.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.589
Adrian...
I have a question for you.

42:21.956 --> 42:22.956
<i>Hmm?</i>

42:23.708 --> 42:25.005
Did you scratch up Nick's car?

42:25.710 --> 42:27.963
Why would I do that?

42:35.094 --> 42:36.136
Gotta go.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.514
Bye.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.148
Well, uh, that's that, then.

42:43.149 --> 42:45.647
Can I have some
of that newspaper there?

42:47.648 --> 42:49.946
Not the crossword.

42:57.825 --> 42:58.825
Hey, Cheyenne.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.920
I... I need to talk to you...

43:01.370 --> 43:02.537
about Adrian.

43:02.538 --> 43:03.458
What?

43:03.459 --> 43:04.332
Not now.

43:04.333 --> 43:05.533
Meet me in back of the orchard

43:05.541 --> 43:08.044
at 7:00 when the streetlights
come on, okay?

43:09.128 --> 43:10.128
Cheyenne, wait.

43:11.297 --> 43:12.297
Wait.

43:24.393 --> 43:25.644
Hey, Cheyenne.

43:25.645 --> 43:27.312
Why are you so slow?

43:27.313 --> 43:28.781
Everybody asks me that.

43:29.315 --> 43:32.275
Cheyenne, come on!
We're waiting!

43:32.276 --> 43:33.243
Shit!

43:33.244 --> 43:35.282
Oh, don't worry about it.
You go get dressed,

43:35.283 --> 43:36.655
and I'll take care of Buttercup.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.658
Sure.

43:57.051 --> 43:58.018
Come on, Kimmy.

43:58.019 --> 44:00.104
Gotta keep a feel of her
through the triple.

44:00.105 --> 44:01.429
That's good.

44:01.430 --> 44:02.806
Just relax.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.309
Thanks for helping me
tack her up.

44:04.310 --> 44:05.355
Sure.

44:08.020 --> 44:08.942
Good.

44:08.943 --> 44:10.315
Adrian, let's go!

44:10.606 --> 44:12.074
Bye. Good luck.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.152
Good luck.

44:21.033 --> 44:22.284
Cheyenne, you're up!

44:47.068 --> 44:49.153
Keep her steady.
Don't let her move.

44:49.395 --> 44:50.395
Call Mr. Gassinger!

44:50.855 --> 44:52.402
Willie, get after that horse!

44:52.565 --> 44:54.363
- Cheyenne.
- Hold still.

44:55.067 --> 44:56.239
Cheyenne, are you okay?

44:59.780 --> 45:01.407
Hang on.
Just hold on to us.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.025
Cheyenne?

45:34.982 --> 45:36.199
Adrian!

45:37.276 --> 45:38.698
You scared the hell out of me.

45:39.195 --> 45:40.663
Just out for a little stroll?

45:41.789 --> 45:42.998
I thought you were Cheyenne.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.288
So, now you like Cheyenne?

45:46.118 --> 45:47.791
Don't be ridiculous.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.669
Maybe you'd like to visit her
in the hospital.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.217
Hospital?
What are you talking about?

45:54.210 --> 45:56.212
Cheyenne took a little spill
at riding today.

45:57.463 --> 45:58.680
Is she all right?

46:00.049 --> 46:01.346
She'll be okay.

46:03.844 --> 46:05.687
It just goes to show you, Nick.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.859
You can never be too careful.

46:21.612 --> 46:23.614
Go ahead. I'll be right there.

46:36.544 --> 46:37.919
Hi, Amy.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.763
Hello, Adrian.

46:41.173 --> 46:42.595
You know, I was wondering.

46:42.883 --> 46:44.885
Have you ever been
out to the lighthouse?

46:45.303 --> 46:46.646
You mean Shelter Point?

46:46.804 --> 46:48.181
Yeah. Make-out place.

46:49.015 --> 46:50.890
Not since high school.

46:50.891 --> 46:52.143
It's nice.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.645
You should definitely go.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.030
Nick took me.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.443
Maybe he'll take you sometime.

47:04.613 --> 47:06.411
Hi.

47:19.879 --> 47:22.119
First, let me remind you
about the benefit next Sunday...

47:22.340 --> 47:23.592
mandatory attendance.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.101
Nicholas, what do you got for us?

47:26.385 --> 47:27.682
Well, why don't we wait
for the printout

47:27.683 --> 47:29.223
that should be here any minute.

47:29.224 --> 47:30.518
What was Levansky like?

47:30.723 --> 47:33.475
What I want to know is,
is it true about his hair?

47:36.270 --> 47:37.437
It was kind of interesting.

47:37.438 --> 47:39.406
I was sitting in what must
have been his den, right?

47:39.407 --> 47:41.107
And there are pictures
everywhere...

47:41.108 --> 47:42.734
him with the governor,
the White House...

47:42.735 --> 47:44.362
Excuse me.

47:44.528 --> 47:46.030
Uh, excuse me one minute.

47:51.410 --> 47:52.494
What is it?

47:52.495 --> 47:53.495
It's blank.

47:53.996 --> 47:54.996
What?

47:55.081 --> 47:57.254
I don't know what to tell you.
There's nothing on it.

47:57.625 --> 47:58.705
What are you talking about?

47:58.876 --> 48:00.093
Something wrong, Eliot?

48:00.461 --> 48:02.088
No, no. Um...

48:02.254 --> 48:03.631
Must have brought the wrong file.

48:03.923 --> 48:04.674
It's okay.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.558
I have plenty of copies at home.

48:06.759 --> 48:07.931
I'll be right back.

48:27.279 --> 48:28.279
Yeah?

48:28.614 --> 48:29.536
It's gone, Amy.

48:29.537 --> 48:32.122
The whole thing...
The interview, the disks,

48:32.123 --> 48:33.870
my cassettes, my notes,
everything.

48:34.245 --> 48:35.885
She came in here
and completely fucked me!

48:35.996 --> 48:38.374
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you talking about?

48:38.624 --> 48:40.843
Adrian. Who do you think
I'm talking about?

48:41.961 --> 48:44.885
Biggest story of my career,
and she... she wipes me out.

48:45.464 --> 48:47.135
What do you want me to do?

48:47.136 --> 48:49.602
I really need you to cover for me
with Michael.

48:49.603 --> 48:51.015
Can you do that?

48:52.096 --> 48:53.723
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I'll try.

48:54.473 --> 48:55.975
Great. Thanks.

48:56.475 --> 48:58.351
And, Amy?

48:58.352 --> 49:00.066
As soon as I finish
rewriting this thing,

49:00.067 --> 49:01.188
I'm out of here for good.

49:01.647 --> 49:03.024
Smart move, Eliot.

49:03.315 --> 49:05.443
All right. Bye.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.240
<i>- Yeah.
- I think we should talk.</i>

50:35.574 --> 50:36.996
Fuck.

50:46.001 --> 50:47.844
<i>Hi. I'm not in.
You know the procedure.</i>

50:49.088 --> 50:50.463
<i>Nick, this is pretty pathetic.</i>

50:50.464 --> 50:52.304
I know you're there.
Why don't you just answer.

50:57.930 --> 50:59.352
Answer the fucking phone!

51:22.663 --> 51:23.663
Ugh!

51:23.956 --> 51:25.924
<i>Uhh!</i>

51:31.630 --> 51:33.219
You sure you want
the Kryptonite?

51:33.220 --> 51:34.467
It's 40 bucks extra.

51:37.678 --> 51:38.804
Give me the Kryptonite.

51:40.681 --> 51:41.933
I like the technique,

51:41.934 --> 51:43.975
but does it make me want
to read the magazine?

51:43.976 --> 51:44.896
First and foremost.

51:44.897 --> 51:47.038
For one thing, I can't understand
what's written down here.

51:47.062 --> 51:48.735
- It's all in...
- I found it.

51:50.149 --> 51:51.649
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

51:51.650 --> 51:53.526
Look, if you're going to use this
lettering, you have to use it right.

51:53.527 --> 51:55.617
Make it simple,
make it mean something.

51:55.618 --> 51:57.786
People out there are
very simple-minded.

51:58.073 --> 51:59.324
Treat them such.

51:59.325 --> 52:00.685
All right, go back
and do it again.

52:03.954 --> 52:06.169
I'll get a plumber in
to fix the shower

52:06.170 --> 52:08.964
and have my grandson give you
a fresh coat of paint.

52:09.418 --> 52:10.778
First of the month
sound all right?

52:10.878 --> 52:14.213
I was... kinda hoping
to move in this week,

52:14.214 --> 52:15.761
if it's all right with you.

52:16.300 --> 52:17.847
Well, why don't we let
your check clear

52:17.848 --> 52:19.344
and get that shower fixed?

52:19.345 --> 52:21.184
I'll let you know first thing
next week.

52:21.185 --> 52:23.399
Great. Thank you,
Mrs. Tinkerman.

52:23.400 --> 52:24.892
Really, thank you.

52:51.210 --> 52:52.553
Hi.

52:52.961 --> 52:54.338
Hey.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.801
Brought you a present, Nick.

52:59.218 --> 53:00.265
Cool.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.602
I don't think we need
to let it breathe, do you?

53:03.603 --> 53:05.349
No, I don't think so.

53:08.227 --> 53:10.525
Looks like you took care
of everything.

53:11.480 --> 53:12.902
Pretty much.

53:13.607 --> 53:15.985
If it's worth anything,
I'm glad you're moving.

53:16.443 --> 53:18.366
You're glad.
I'm overjoyed.

53:23.325 --> 53:24.872
Hey, Nick.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.457
Yeah?

53:26.620 --> 53:28.293
I got to ask you a question.

53:28.706 --> 53:29.706
Shoot.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.010
Next week, Michael's benefit...

53:34.294 --> 53:35.637
Are you going?

53:35.879 --> 53:38.928
Well, we, uh... have to, right?

53:41.510 --> 53:43.387
I want you to go with me.

53:44.096 --> 53:45.696
What, you mean, like together,
on a date?

53:47.266 --> 53:49.562
Okay. Never mind.
I know I shouldn't have...

53:49.563 --> 53:51.904
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

53:53.105 --> 53:55.278
Whatever happened to, um...

53:55.733 --> 53:57.986
"Don't get your meat
where you lay your eggs" thing?

53:58.277 --> 54:00.996
- Bread. Where you make your bread.
- Bread. Bread, right.

54:02.740 --> 54:03.741
Well...

54:05.033 --> 54:06.501
I wouldn't wanna...

54:06.827 --> 54:09.000
see you slow dance
with Samantha.

54:09.001 --> 54:10.373
Mm-hm.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.416
Or some 13-year-old.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.500
14.

54:17.421 --> 54:19.924
Yeah... wouldn't like that.

56:21.670 --> 56:23.217
Adrian!

56:24.172 --> 56:25.424
What are you doing?

56:26.550 --> 56:28.052
Making lemonade.

56:29.845 --> 56:31.062
Want some?

56:40.480 --> 56:42.107
Hello, Adrian.

56:42.482 --> 56:44.234
How are you today?

56:44.401 --> 56:46.403
- Fine.
- That's good.

56:47.237 --> 56:48.237
Hey, Amy.

56:48.405 --> 56:49.622
What?

56:50.365 --> 56:52.163
What did you do last night?

56:54.244 --> 56:55.369
What do you mean?

56:55.370 --> 56:56.930
I mean, you slept at Nick's,
didn't you?

56:57.205 --> 56:58.548
Adrian...

56:59.541 --> 57:02.761
Well, I mean, you didn't...
you know.

57:04.463 --> 57:05.680
Adrian...

57:07.090 --> 57:08.763
Let me explain
a little something to you.

57:09.426 --> 57:12.646
One day, when you're all grown up
and you have a real relationship,

57:13.138 --> 57:15.973
you'll realize your feelings
for Nick were just a thing.

57:15.974 --> 57:16.974
Just a crush.

57:17.059 --> 57:19.357
In fact, I bet by the time
school starts,

57:19.811 --> 57:22.690
you'll have completely forgotten
all about him.

57:23.690 --> 57:27.991
God, Amy... when I grow up,
I hope I can be just as smart as you.

57:28.153 --> 57:29.450
Adrian...

57:30.280 --> 57:32.954
Go Play-

59:39.159 --> 59:41.161
Oh, my God.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:16.155
No! No! No! No!

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.326
Hello.

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:56.827
Oh, hi, Michael.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:01.699
No, no. I was just going over
a few things.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.043
Really?

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.250
Can I come in?

01:01:06.251 --> 01:01:08.123
No. It's fine.
What is it?

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.456
Sorry.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:10.925
<i>There's been an accident.</i>

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:12.963
Don't want to bug you.

01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:15.004
Just wanted to give you
the info on the competition.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:17.306
Wh... What happened?

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:22.725
What?

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.850
Oh, Jesus!

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.983
Um... yeah.
Wh... Where is it?

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.399
Okay. I'll be right over.
All right. Bye.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:36.610
What's wrong?

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:38.787
Uh... it's Amy.

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:40.997
She's at the hospital.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.416
She's been
in some kind of accident.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.919
Oh, Nick! I'm so sorry.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.056
<i>Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.974
<i>I'd like to welcome all of you</i>

01:02:03.975 --> 01:02:07.224
<i>to the Regional Junior
Jumping Championships.</i>

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:10.481
He literally cried on my shoulder.
Poor baby.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:12.691
Broke my heart.

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.315
So, how is she?

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:18.739
Oh... well, they think
she'll live, but...

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.905
Anyway, I think it's brought
Nick and I a lot closer.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.597
Well, you'll sit with him,
won't you?

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.462
If I see him... If he comes.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:31.372
He'll be here.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.377
Aren't you going to tell me
to break a leg?

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.304
Break 'em both.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.723
<i>First off is number 87...</i>

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:43.931
<i>Miss Linda Mattheson
riding Snowdrop.</i>

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.980
<i>Number 191...</i>

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.901
<i>Miss Kelly Sensabough
riding Ace High.</i>

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:54.112
<i>- Number 62...
- Give them to me.</i>

01:02:54.113 --> 01:02:56.903
<i>Nicole Nairwood...
Sheena's Wind.</i>

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.363
<i>Number 183...</i>

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:07.538
<i>Miss Adrian Forrester
riding Sinbad.</i>

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.071
I think it's important
in our busy lives

01:03:43.072 --> 01:03:45.492
that we remember
those less fortunate.

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:48.324
I'd like to thank you all
for your generosity

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.748
and hope you will continue
to support our cause.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.000
And with that,
I'd like to introduce you

01:03:53.001 --> 01:03:54.872
to the American president
of NANDEC,

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:56.750
Miss Abigail Spaulding.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.013
Hi, sweetheart.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.137
What are you doing here?

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:07.427
Missed you at the show.
Did something come up?

01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:08.811
Go on, get out of here.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.558
Too busy kissing ass
to care about me, is that it?

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:18.437
Ow!

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:24.569
Forgive us.
I'll have him back in a jiffy.

01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:26.528
Ow!

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.370
That's it! I want you to stay
the fuck away from me!

01:04:28.371 --> 01:04:29.467
- I thought we were...
- We're nothing!

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:31.118
I love you, Nick,
and you love me.

01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:32.159
You're sick.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.003
You fucking...!

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.558
You're pathetic.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:06.865
Mrs. Tinkerman!

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.954
Mrs. Tinkerman,
it's me, Nick Eliot.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:14.618
The apartment's taken.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.166
What?
What are you talking about?

01:05:16.167 --> 01:05:18.210
I don't rent to drug dealers!

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:19.957
Oh, God!

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.301
The girl you rent from told me!

01:05:21.302 --> 01:05:23.420
Mrs. Tinkerman, she's lying!

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:26.296
Mrs. Tinkerman!

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:27.844
I'll give you three
to get out of here.

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:29.550
1...

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.517
- Nicholas Eliot?
- Yeah?

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:22.758
Put your hands on your head
and step slowly from the car.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:23.855
What's going on?

01:06:23.856 --> 01:06:25.949
Shut up and get out
of the car now.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.530
You mind telling me
what this is all about?

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.653
I'm going to tell you.
You're under arrest.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:32.576
What?

01:06:32.577 --> 01:06:34.117
For sexual assault of a minor.

01:06:34.118 --> 01:06:35.782
What? What are you talking about?

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:36.955
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:38.598
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a second?

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:40.038
Damn it!

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:49.305
Honey, honey, I know.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:52.508
Cliff!

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.477
You fucking animal!

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:55.473
- Wait!
- You animal!

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:58.231
Get him off me!
Get him off me!

01:06:58.431 --> 01:06:59.848
Cliff!

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.350
Get him off me!

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:02.351
Stay back!

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.325
Watch your head.

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.868
We went swimming...

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.870
and hung out a couple of times,

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.418
but it was nothing.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:26.676
And, um...

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:28.882
he just wouldn't take no
for an answer.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:35.177
And he...
he threw me down, and, um...

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:36.978
hit me.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:40.639
And he... he just kept hitting me,
and I was crying.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.476
He kept hitting me and yelling.

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:47.355
I was so scared.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:50.400
Honey, it'll be okay.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.910
Ought to just put Dad
in the room with him,

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.537
call it a day.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:57.407
From the clay I moved in,
she's been hassling me.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:58.865
You know, uh,

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:00.511
she calls me up
in the middle of the night,

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:01.912
hanging around the house.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:03.999
Uh, she...
She breaks into the place.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.920
You know, she scratches up my car.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.751
I mean, the girl
is completely spun.

01:08:07.752 --> 01:08:09.377
Why won't anyone
fucking believe me?

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:12.756
You ever have sexual contact
of any kind with...?

01:08:12.757 --> 01:08:14.348
You think I'm crazy? No!

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:18.679
You ever, at any time, place
your penis inside of her vagina?

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.804
I just told you, no!

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.179
I mean, she's crazy!

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.540
She's the one
you ought to lock up!

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.354
You rape a little girl,
you act like she's crazy?

01:08:25.356 --> 01:08:27.149
I didn't do anything!

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:29.064
Jesus Christ!

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.779
Did you check out that...
That room in the garage,

01:08:32.781 --> 01:08:34.698
the one with the shrine?
Did you check it out?

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.377
We got a problem, Nick.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:45.621
Big problem.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.756
What?

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:53.179
We found semen inside of her.

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.301
Let's go.

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:16.211
The parents are taking
the girl away tonight,

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:18.078
down the coast somewhere.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:21.325
Until that time, you're not permitted
within 100 feet of the house.

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:24.283
After they've gone, you can gather
your possessions and move out.

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:25.645
It doesn't matter where,
just away.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.966
The semen sample matches
your blood type.

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:34.170
Look... I figured it out.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.758
She got hold of a condom,
she must have snuck in

01:09:36.759 --> 01:09:38.884
and, uh, stolen one
from the trash.

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:41.602
Michael...

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.269
I swear I never laid
a hand on her.

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:46.975
You got to believe me. She...

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:48.600
She's crazy.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.104
She's also a little girl...

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:52.904
A 14-year-old girl.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:56.150
Now, you be the jury.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:41.404
Ow! Goddamn it!

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:44.471
Jesus!

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.478
Cheyenne,
what are you doing here?

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:48.854
I had to talk to you.

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:52.438
Uh, you shouldn't be here.
I've got enough trouble.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.648
You didn't do those things
to Adrian.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:01.241
Y... You d...
You didn't do those things.

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:03.285
Of course not.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.872
I knew she was making it up.
I knew it.

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:09.699
What is it, Cheyenne?

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:12.378
Did Adrian ever tell you
about a guy named Rick?

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.380
Yeah, I think so.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.424
Said he was a friend. Why?

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.384
He was our camp counselor.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:20.253
Adrian had a crush on him.

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:21.800
So?

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.882
He's dead.
He ate something poisoned.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.052
Everyone thought
it was an accident...

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:32.481
b... but Adrian knows stuff,
stuff that other kids don't know.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:36.979
She knows about wasps, too.

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.779
I know.

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:41.820
I thought about that.

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:44.861
But there's just no proof.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.613
But I think there might be.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.575
Adrian kept a diary.
She writes everything in it.

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:53.537
She thinks no one knows about it,
but I've seen it.

01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:55.663
She kept it hidden in her bedroom.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.795
I'll tell the lawyers
about the diary, but...

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.923
You got to forget all about
Adrian. She's sick.

01:13:01.924 --> 01:13:03.466
You understand?

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:07.183
Come on.
You really shouldn't be here.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.724
She's a liar.
She's lying about you.

01:13:10.725 --> 01:13:13.060
I know.
But I can take care of myself.

01:13:13.061 --> 01:13:14.398
Come on. I'll walk you.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.697
I'll be all right.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.696
Done it a million times.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:26.910
Later.

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.727
Cheyenne!

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.818
Cheyenne!

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:33.180
So this is what it takes
to finally get you up here.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:35.307
What are you doing?

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:37.305
Fixing things.

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.094
Where's Cheyenne?

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.847
You want to do her, too?
Is that it?

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.810
I'm not good enough for you?

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:45.016
Where is she, Adrian?

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:46.394
I came back here for you, Nick.

01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:48.394
My parents tried
to take me away,

01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:49.395
but I fooled them.

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:51.865
Where is she?

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:55.119
I came back here for you, and I
found you with my best friend.

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.370
I still love you, Nick!

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:01.616
Cheyenne!

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:02.617
Nick!

01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:03.960
Cheyenne!

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:05.203
Nick!

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:27.105
Accidents happen, Nick.

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:29.900
I warned you.

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:34.359
You know...

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:38.784
In 10 years none of this
would have mattered.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:40.490
I'd be 24.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.950
You'd be 38.

01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:48.248
It's so sad it had to end this way.

01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:52.171
What we had was so special...

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:56.175
but...

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.471
here we are.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.851
Too bad you didn't listen.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.944
I just want you to know, Nick...

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:14.156
no matter what happens...

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:17.364
we'll always be friends.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:26.205
Adrian!

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.162
Adrian!

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.887
Adrian! Shit!

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.306
Oh!

01:18:43.307 --> 01:18:44.428
Adrian!

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:49.729
Adrian! God!

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:56.653
Cheyenne!

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.385
Ow!

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:24.926
Cheyenne!

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:26.769
Goddamn it!

01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:29.515
Adrian!

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:40.566
Cheyenne!

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:22.325
Jesus!

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.071
You okay?

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:37.457
Hold on.

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:42.838
I'm going to kill you!

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.279
Adrian!

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:04.819
Dad!

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.336
Daddy, help me!

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:15.953
I'll kill you!

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:18.298
You... You son of a bitch!

01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:26.720
Leave him alone!

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:36.285
So, there you are.

01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:37.794
It's quiet in here.

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:39.204
Mm-hm.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:41.497
Another letter?

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:43.341
Yeah.

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:48.422
If only he'd let me apologize,
I'd feel so much better.

01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:50.512
Hey, you've been making
great progress.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:52.016
Concentrate on that.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.065
I just wish everyone was as...
As understanding as you are.

01:22:58.474 --> 01:22:59.817
Well, they will be.

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:01.352
It's just gonna take time
for people to see

01:23:01.353 --> 01:23:03.774
that you've changed, okay?

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:05.188
Mm-hm.

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:07.115
Well, you better get to class.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:09.400
And I'll see you in our session
this afternoon.

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:10.401
Okay.

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:13.239
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:37.438
Sleepyhead missed
the morning meeting.

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.483
Shit!

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.523
Oh, man!

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:47.364
Don't worry, I told Michael
you're on the trail of some big story.

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:49.148
Thanks.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:54.445
Air mail.
