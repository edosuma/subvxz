02:05.790 --> 02:08.669
I can't go back!
The camera is gone!

02:08.789 --> 02:11.146
- Now <i>calm down!
- </i> Maybe you didn't understand, they stole it!

02:11.170 --> 02:13.670
<i>- It's your assignment.
- </i> They know everything!

02:13.710 --> 02:15.266
- They know they're being watched!
- You have to go <i>back!</i>

02:15.290 --> 02:16.130
I can not!

02:16.170 --> 02:18.040
- <i>You have to do it! Now!
- </i> Hello?

02:39.380 --> 02:41.000
Germany attacks!

02:41.040 --> 02:43.210
Poland is in crisis!

02:43.460 --> 02:45.830
Britain prepares
to fight the war!

AUGUST-VICTORY COLLEGE
OF BEXHILL-BY-THE-SEA

05:35.920 --> 05:41.500
SIX MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT

06:10.460 --> 06:13.210
Is this your first time
here in Bexhill-sur-Mer?

06:14.460 --> 06:15.630
Yup.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.750
Is the first time.

06:24.670 --> 06:27.830
I hope he lasts longer
than the other gentleman.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.130
See you later.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.710
And one, and two

06:49.500 --> 06:50.750
Come on!

06:53.540 --> 06:55.540
Hands on the ground.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.630
Keep your arms straight.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.380
And one, and two,

07:14.170 --> 07:16.540
Roll out. Very well.

07:18.630 --> 07:20.500
Well, girls.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.210
You go on, Astrid.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.710
<i>Gut, Màdels. Also...</i>

07:25.830 --> 07:27.830
Astrid! In English.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.380
Thanks.

07:30.630 --> 07:33.210
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.356
- Can I help you?
- I come for the teaching position,

07:35.380 --> 07:36.920
I'm Thomas Miller.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.210
Ilse Keller.

07:38.670 --> 07:40.670
- Welcome to Augusta Victoria.
- Thanks.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.750
This way, please.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.880
- One!
- Mr. Miller?

07:51.380 --> 07:52.790
Come on!

07:53.330 --> 07:56.500
Shoulders, arms out, and down.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.080
One, and two, and up.

08:02.580 --> 08:06.630
As you know, England and Germany
have been allies for many years now.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.250
This is Augusta Victoria.
The last German empress.

08:14.500 --> 08:18.790
If she wins the teaching position,
her room will be on the top floor.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.960
Her modest room, but facing south.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.250
She looks perfect.

08:23.580 --> 08:26.040
Mr. Wheatley found her welcoming.

08:27.790 --> 08:29.670
Please, sit down.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.880
I don't have to fear the competition!

08:33.710 --> 08:35.419
<i>She fide et Patientia.</i>

08:36.289 --> 08:38.880
"Faith and perseverance".

08:39.000 --> 08:40.580
This is the college's motto.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.960
You better know. Good luck.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.290
Thanks.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.080
Wonderful, don't you think?

09:50.670 --> 09:52.920
- Eleanor Rocholl.
- Thomas Miller.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.580
Thanks for coming
on short notice.

09:55.710 --> 09:58.040
- Do not mention it.
- Follow me.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.330
MONDAY 21 AUGUST

10:04.540 --> 10:06.960
I see it was recommended
by an agency...

10:09.080 --> 10:11.040
And that he has taught
in many different schools.

10:12.540 --> 10:13.540
Thanks.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.830
It wasn't a compliment.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.420
Here it says that he is a musician.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.460
I manage to play the piano.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.500
Helpful.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.420
He's married?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.670
I have been.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Spanish influence.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.420
I wouldn't normally
hire a temporary teacher,

10:37.960 --> 10:41.790
but his predecessor
proved unreliable.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.170
My girls need discipline.

10:45.710 --> 10:48.710
We will soon introduce them to the
members of the Anglo-German brotherhood.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.630
I guess they will be impatient.

10:51.710 --> 10:55.330
They don't talk about anything else.
These are the last days of summer.

10:56.460 --> 10:57.960
We hope not.

10:59.380 --> 11:01.790
What brings you here, Mr. Miller?

11:03.710 --> 11:06.920
Which Englishman would
accept a teaching position...

11:07.000 --> 11:09.460
In Herr Hitler's League
of German Girls?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.580
My father was German.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.210
I don't like surprises,

11:19.250 --> 11:21.250
so he will do a probationary period.

11:22.830 --> 11:23.830
Thanks.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.670
When can I start?

11:41.710 --> 11:43.330
Good morning.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.040
I am Mr. Miller...

11:48.290 --> 11:51.210
And I'll be your
new English teacher.

12:07.330 --> 12:08.750
<i>Mr...</i>

12:12.000 --> 12:13.630
Miller

12:14.130 --> 12:15.380
Good morning, Mr. Miller.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.250
- Good morning...
- Astrid.

12:18.380 --> 12:19.580
Astrid.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.080
- We welcome you.
- Thanks.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.960
Then,

12:26.750 --> 12:30.790
what did you study
during the summer?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.880
Oh, please, sit down.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.500
Is there a book in
English that you liked?

12:43.830 --> 12:47.750
Mr. Wheatley was not
used to using books.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.920
Exact. He told us the stories.

12:50.290 --> 12:51.750
But really?

12:57.920 --> 13:01.830
Here, I'm not very
good at public speaking.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.880
It doesn't have to be
Shakespeare, Mr. Miller.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.580
Please tell us a story.

13:09.750 --> 13:10.750
Alright then.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.920
How about a story...

13:15.960 --> 13:20.040
How about a romantic story.

13:21.830 --> 13:23.580
That speaks...

13:23.630 --> 13:26.330
of a young man
who misses his lover?

13:26.460 --> 13:28.290
Are you talking about you, Mr. Miller?

13:28.420 --> 13:29.420
No.

13:31.710 --> 13:35.330
The Fijhrer would say that
he is not enough of a man.

13:35.630 --> 13:37.170
Would the Fiihrer say this?

13:43.500 --> 13:44.670
Please,

13:45.420 --> 13:46.540
tell us the story.

13:46.630 --> 13:49.420
Of the young man who
misses his sweetheart.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.500
All right.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.540
Once upon a time,

13:54.380 --> 13:57.330
in a place called...

14:11.830 --> 14:13.830
What are they singing?

14:14.380 --> 14:16.960
We will have to keep an eye on him.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.790
Very well.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.250
Go in time.

14:37.290 --> 14:39.540
Not too fast.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.960
Grace, poise,

14:45.040 --> 14:46.540
Mastery.

14:49.330 --> 14:50.830
Remember, girls,
that you will be

14:50.880 --> 14:54.630
the representatives
of Augusta Victoria.

14:55.330 --> 14:57.500
Straighten your shoulders, Sigrid!

14:58.880 --> 15:03.170
Security in the eyes
leaves an indelible mark.

15:06.960 --> 15:07.960
Gretel!

15:14.170 --> 15:16.210
Go on, Mr. Miller.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.500
The morning swim.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.630
Whether there is sun or rain,

15:48.670 --> 15:50.670
Ilse always insists.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.170
Why doesn't she join us?

16:14.580 --> 16:18.790
You know, Ilse was in the
reserve team at the Berlin Olympics.

16:18.920 --> 16:19.920
Amazing.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.290
We are lucky to have it again.

16:24.670 --> 16:29.130
Their morning swim is all
they will get to see of England.

16:31.170 --> 16:34.250
I want to protect girls from
the dangers of the world.

16:34.830 --> 16:36.290
Have they never left this place?

16:38.080 --> 16:42.790
England can be a very hostile
place when you are born a German.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.290
I think you know what
I'm talking about, Mr. Miller.

16:49.380 --> 16:50.790
I almost caught up with you today.

16:51.130 --> 16:53.460
Yes, yes, in your dreams.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.380
I'm freezing, hurry up Paula.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.710
You are the last.

16:57.830 --> 16:59.580
No, I'm not the last.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.130
Gretel is always the latest.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.080
That toad didn't
even get wet today.

17:03.170 --> 17:06.540
- Who are you talking about?
- Gretel didn't swim!

17:43.790 --> 17:45.920
<i>Use '.!</i>

17:45.960 --> 17:47.580
<i>Use '.!</i>

18:24.830 --> 18:25.960
See you later.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.830
Courage! I know you are there!
I can hear you breathe!

19:13.080 --> 19:14.500
Oh, finally someone laughing!

19:14.540 --> 19:16.710
Did you like it, my dear? Very well.

19:16.790 --> 19:19.290
You are really nice,
keep it up, please.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.290
Oh, if this continues...

19:21.330 --> 19:23.330
My dinner is going to get cold, right?

19:23.380 --> 19:28.420
But it will never be as
cold as marriage, will it, sir?

19:28.920 --> 19:30.266
She is really lovely.
Now listen to me, I

19:30.290 --> 19:32.830
want to tell you a
story that you will like.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.500
Well, at least I hope so, or
I'll never work here again.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.500
Then?

19:40.540 --> 19:42.540
Officially they speak of suicide.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.710
Wheatley wouldn't have
the courage to commit

19:45.750 --> 19:48.330
suicide, he was terrified
when he called me.

19:49.210 --> 19:51.000
Someone got to him first.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.830
His information was right.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.380
Twenty girls, one governess,

19:56.460 --> 20:00.080
- a waitress, a cook...
- I need something more!

20:03.670 --> 20:05.710
How's it going with the governess?

20:05.790 --> 20:07.630
And with Ilse Keller?

20:07.710 --> 20:09.380
My German helps.

20:09.460 --> 20:12.790
At least it's useful for something.
You keep searching the house.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.250
We don't have much time left.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.420
Hitler is allied with Stalin and
has carte blanche in Poland.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.500
The War Council
claims the Germans will

20:23.580 --> 20:27.040
take the girls before
the end of the summer.

20:27.130 --> 20:30.500
An early exit only means one thing.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.540
He'll have to block them
before that happens.

20:34.130 --> 20:36.380
But if he intervenes too soon,

20:36.670 --> 20:38.580
problems could arise.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.670
What kind of plan is this?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
These are strange times, Miller.

20:44.750 --> 20:47.920
And every chess
game needs its pawns.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.880
They're just girls, sir.

20:49.960 --> 20:54.420
They are the daughters and goddaughters
of the Nazi High Command, so...

20:54.500 --> 20:58.040
Remember which side you're on, Miller.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.880
We will soon commandeer the
boarding school and detain the girls.

21:02.170 --> 21:03.750
You hold on.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.186
Do you want to imprison them?

21:05.210 --> 21:07.210
He must wake up, Miller!

21:08.170 --> 21:11.750
The next war will not be like
the ones we have experienced.

21:23.540 --> 21:27.170
Oh, these are the words I've
been waiting for for twenty-five years!"

21:56.830 --> 21:58.960
SATURDAY 26 AUGUST

23:09.960 --> 23:16.670
<i>because you are flesh of
our flesh and blood of our blood.</i>

23:17.000 --> 23:22.040
<i>The same spirit that governs
us burns in your young minds.</i>

23:28.580 --> 23:35.710
<i>When the pillars of our movement</i>

23:35.790 --> 23:43.540
<i>will cross Germany today...</i>

23:43.670 --> 23:47.920
<i>I know you will join them.</i>

23:51.380 --> 23:54.210
<i>We know that
Germany is around us.</i>

23:54.290 --> 23:56.580
<i>That Germany
marches within us...</i>

23:56.710 --> 24:00.540
<i>May Germany follow us!</i>

24:02.670 --> 24:04.460
DG II Q0

24:04.540 --> 24:06.540
DG II Q0

24:44.960 --> 24:46.420
Forward.

24:50.420 --> 24:51.750
Miss Rocholl.

24:57.250 --> 25:01.790
It means "Salute to
Victory", Mr. Miller, that's all.

25:04.540 --> 25:06.380
We must not apologize
for excess of passion,

25:07.080 --> 25:08.540
or for pride.

25:10.380 --> 25:13.710
Should we criticize a country
that strives to be great?

25:22.330 --> 25:25.630
Bexhill was a beautiful
city to grow up in.

25:26.290 --> 25:29.460
Its sea, its landscapes, its community.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.920
As a child, I felt safe.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.290
My father loved me very much

25:36.380 --> 25:39.580
and gave me a sense of pride.

25:41.670 --> 25:46.080
My teaching and my
college are dedicated to this.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.500
These girls

25:51.290 --> 25:52.920
they are my life.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.000
They give me hope.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.630
That's why I join them when
they say "Salute to victory".

26:03.380 --> 26:05.500
“Sieg Heil”, Mr. Miller.

26:08.670 --> 26:11.210
I don't expect you to understand me.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.170
Who knows she doesn't know, she knows her. But who
doesn't know that she doesn't know, she doesn't know.

26:23.540 --> 26:28.540
Only who knows that she knows
nothing, she knows more than who knows."

26:29.500 --> 26:30.630
Good.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.500
"In a well...

26:35.080 --> 26:39.500
"Once a wolf was reflected
in a not so gloomy well..."

26:46.170 --> 26:47.540
Here you are.

26:48.330 --> 26:50.170
Were you looking for me, Mr. Miller?

27:03.250 --> 27:04.460
I was worried about you.

27:05.920 --> 27:10.170
- And the girls were too.
- He's not a good liar, Mr. Miller.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.130
Girls don't like me.

27:16.420 --> 27:19.960
But that's okay.
I'm smarter than them.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.250
Yes, I really think so.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.420
But you don't seem very happy.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.170
Gretel, what happened
to Mr. Wheatley...

27:44.250 --> 27:45.750
Fraulein Keller says...

27:46.540 --> 27:49.500
That I have to overcome
my fears if I want to be strong.

27:50.790 --> 27:52.210
Gretel...

27:52.290 --> 27:54.130
Do you think she is right?

27:54.210 --> 27:56.580
Gretel, it's normal to be afraid.

27:58.580 --> 27:59.630
Really?

28:04.130 --> 28:05.130
Yup.

28:07.670 --> 28:09.750
What scares you, Mr. Miller?

28:13.130 --> 28:14.130
Astrid.

28:18.670 --> 28:20.670
Time to go in, girls!

28:21.130 --> 28:23.790
Choir rehearsal will
start in ten minutes!

28:37.580 --> 28:39.880
I am still not
convinced of this tour.

28:40.580 --> 28:42.750
After what happened,

28:43.000 --> 28:46.080
maybe girls need a
change of scenery.

28:46.830 --> 28:49.080
Yes, but we must not go too far.

28:49.210 --> 28:51.460
Some recreation is just
what you need and Fràulein

28:51.540 --> 28:54.920
Keller said the view from
the castle is magnificent!

28:55.000 --> 28:57.960
I would like to say the same
for the choice of transport.

29:05.500 --> 29:09.000
- What does Ronnie want now?
- Girls, stay seated.

29:09.330 --> 29:12.000
- Guten Morgen.
- I can't say the same.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.130
- What is happening?
- First line of defense.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.250
We need to get the claws out.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.540
There is a lookout post in Eastbourne.

29:19.630 --> 29:22.130
In Eastbourne?
What do you think Hitler will do?

29:22.210 --> 29:25.210
- What are you stealing our fries?
- You need to be ready.

29:25.540 --> 29:27.790
As you say, Ronnie. See you.

29:30.420 --> 29:33.880
RENT CHARLIE'S BUS
PHONE BEXHILL 4290

29:34.250 --> 29:38.210
Damn eat sauerkraut.
Come on guys! Resume!

29:50.040 --> 29:52.920
We also needed a tour.

29:53.580 --> 29:56.080
From here I can
almost see Germany!

29:56.250 --> 29:57.580
Be careful girls!

29:57.710 --> 30:00.830
Mom, save me from
this horrible food <i>and...</i>

30:00.920 --> 30:05.130
- from swimming caps!
- And from bad weather!

30:06.170 --> 30:08.380
Girls! Now calm down!

30:08.920 --> 30:10.790
Mr. Miller is right!

30:10.880 --> 30:12.830
You will wake up the sleeping giant.

30:13.460 --> 30:15.460
Are there giants here?

30:15.670 --> 30:17.290
Ask Miss Rocholl.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.330
A long time ago, they
lived on top of the hills...

30:20.420 --> 30:23.880
- and they saw all of England.
- What happened to him?

30:24.290 --> 30:26.420
They scared someone, I guess.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.830
Like Sigrid.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.500
One of the giants
protected the castle.

30:32.380 --> 30:35.830
They gave him bread, mustard
and a pig's head of beer.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.250
He slept down there on the shore.

30:40.330 --> 30:42.210
Why is the sand so flat there?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.580
- Because the giant was heavy.
- Heavier than a steamer.

30:47.330 --> 30:51.380
It is said that he was able to swim to
France without getting his head wet.

31:24.670 --> 31:26.580
But look at it, Mr. Miller.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.540
A true gentleman.

31:28.670 --> 31:31.460
You are very elegant
tonight, Fraulein Keller.

31:31.580 --> 31:32.670
Thanks.

31:34.540 --> 31:36.920
- We want to go?
- Sure.

31:49.460 --> 31:52.080
Let me say thank you.

33:36.130 --> 33:39.040
ANGLO-GERMAN ALLIANCE.

34:01.250 --> 34:04.080
The girls will be
happy to meet you.

34:04.790 --> 34:08.130
It will be a real honor
for me to meet them.

34:08.210 --> 34:09.380
This way.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.630
I shouldn't do it without
asking Frau Rocholl's

34:12.710 --> 34:15.750
permission first, but I know
how much she loves Reuther.

34:15.830 --> 34:18.250
Look. She is very
proud of this piece.

34:18.330 --> 34:19.790
Enchanting.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.540
She finds?

34:21.920 --> 34:25.420
The dance of fire.
There are only seven examples.

34:27.330 --> 34:29.210
Tomorrow night.

34:29.290 --> 34:30.630
Tomorrow?

34:31.540 --> 34:33.130
I need more time.

34:33.210 --> 34:34.960
I got orders.

34:35.040 --> 34:38.170
The girls have to leave
before the war starts.

34:38.540 --> 34:40.540
Do you know a place?

34:40.790 --> 34:42.790
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

34:43.960 --> 34:46.750
Safe enough to
allow a plane to land?

34:47.130 --> 34:48.500
Yup.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.880
- What is that?
- A film.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.710
A list of British agents
working in Germany.

34:54.790 --> 34:57.170
There are all the names.

34:58.670 --> 35:01.750
Do you think the Fiihrer
would authorize this

35:01.830 --> 35:04.080
trip if he didn't get
something out of it?

35:04.170 --> 35:07.540
He wants them back. All of us.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.880
She wants you to do your duty.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.750
Girls can't just be caught.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.290
Where is that place?

35:17.040 --> 35:18.500
<i>Use?</i>

35:18.960 --> 35:20.960
Is everything all right?

35:22.460 --> 35:25.580
I was just showing the
minister his Reuther.

35:25.670 --> 35:26.500
Do you forgive me.

35:26.580 --> 35:29.830
I am a private collector.
I had to see it with my own eyes.

35:30.710 --> 35:31.790
Of course.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.420
Get to know Lord Brocket.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.460
He is a close friend of Astrid's father.

35:37.540 --> 35:38.630
Certainly.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.420
The "if!
Have you seen Mr. Miller?

36:04.630 --> 36:08.290
Oh, Astrid, here you are.
Can you round up the girls upstairs?

36:08.750 --> 36:12.420
They say that the success of a great
agreement is based on two aspects:

36:13.540 --> 36:17.250
The first is to
appreciate affinities;

36:18.080 --> 36:22.380
and the second is to
respect differences.

36:23.580 --> 36:26.250
Tonight we will join
with the other side of

36:26.380 --> 36:29.630
the sea to celebrate
a very special bond.

36:30.790 --> 36:33.580
Representing the
Anglo-German Alliance,

36:33.670 --> 36:38.380
let me introduce you to
the “Augusta Vittoria...

37:05.500 --> 37:08.500
HOG GOD THE FATHER

37:49.330 --> 37:52.330
- Ouch, how bad!
- Focus, Sigrid!

37:52.630 --> 37:56.290
Before grace, there is strength.
And before strength, there is...

37:56.420 --> 37:58.130
- Pain!
- The training.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.750
Belly inside.

38:03.420 --> 38:06.000
And dance as light as a feather.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.080
Do you think you are better than us?

38:50.750 --> 38:54.540
I'm organizing the meetings, Miller.
I don't like her to take initiatives!

38:54.630 --> 38:56.380
- The girls are about to leave.
- When?

38:56.460 --> 38:58.080
Tomorrow.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.210
- How do you know?
- Ilse Keller.

39:00.580 --> 39:04.420
Tonight at the Anglo-German party
I heard her talking to her contact.

39:04.580 --> 39:06.830
- And how will she take them away?
- With an airplane.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.330
Where is it?

39:16.920 --> 39:18.710
I have to inform the War Council.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.080
Can you assure me I
haven't been caught?

39:21.210 --> 39:23.460
- Yup!
- Are you really sure?

39:25.420 --> 39:27.000
Damn!

39:55.380 --> 39:57.420
Call Whitehall.
One-one-five-four.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.750
He has to sound the alarm.

40:01.540 --> 40:02.710
Colonel.

40:03.540 --> 40:04.830
Colonel!

40:05.290 --> 40:06.380
Colonel.

40:35.670 --> 40:37.710
Hey! Stay where it is!

40:38.790 --> 40:39.880
He doesn't move!

40:41.960 --> 40:43.790
- What did he do?
- It wasn't me.

40:44.580 --> 40:46.500
George! Come here now!

40:47.830 --> 40:49.750
He is running away! Stop!

40:51.580 --> 40:52.670
Stop! Police!

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
He is trying to hide!

41:04.290 --> 41:06.290
- I saw it!
- Get it!

41:38.080 --> 41:39.460
Scatter yourselves!

41:42.130 --> 41:44.880
Search the beach far and wide!

41:46.130 --> 41:48.460
Reinforcements are about
to join us with the dogs!

41:50.170 --> 41:52.880
- Watch! And he!
- Yes I saw it!

41:54.460 --> 41:55.710
He is running away!

42:17.960 --> 42:21.380
Police say he is a
dangerous man. A killer.

42:22.330 --> 42:24.460
Why would he do such a thing?

42:25.290 --> 42:27.380
Did we really know him?

42:27.460 --> 42:30.830
He was our teacher
and we liked him.

42:40.460 --> 42:42.290
It can be difficult

42:42.920 --> 42:45.330
recognize the disposition of a person.

42:46.290 --> 42:48.290
There are those who are

42:48.420 --> 42:49.920
good, and those who are bad.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.880
What is the difference?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.710
It is not always easy to say.

42:56.790 --> 43:01.130
How do you tell the difference
between the wasp and the bee?

43:02.330 --> 43:04.170
Wasps can't make honey.

43:04.250 --> 43:05.250
Exact.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.670
Who wants to give another example?

43:11.290 --> 43:14.080
- Gretel?
- Alligators and crocodiles.

43:14.750 --> 43:16.750
And how do we understand the difference?

43:17.880 --> 43:20.500
- From their teeth.
- <i>And...?</i>

43:25.380 --> 43:28.670
From the shape of their skull.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.460
The Jew

43:50.130 --> 43:52.130
<i>is...</i>

43:52.540 --> 43:54.290
The Gentile.

43:56.460 --> 43:59.080
We have been duped by Mr. Miller.

44:00.330 --> 44:04.790
At first it may seem
difficult to identify a "Jew".

44:06.580 --> 44:09.790
But there are ways to figure it out.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.670
I'm sorry.

44:14.750 --> 44:16.290
I didn't want to interrupt.

44:16.380 --> 44:18.000
After what happened, I was

44:18.080 --> 44:21.960
wondering if the girls
would like a break.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.710
A cup of tea.

44:24.920 --> 44:27.130
Maybe at the end of the lesson.

44:46.790 --> 44:48.420
You have to forget about her.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.500
Forget about this place.

44:53.790 --> 44:56.080
Germany is your home.

45:28.420 --> 45:30.100
Where do you think you are, in Shangri-La?

45:30.380 --> 45:34.210
In an hour we will play at the
Winter Gardens. Get moving!

45:34.290 --> 45:38.000
And Bill, don't send
sand into your flugelhorn.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.960
Come on, Jackie! Hurry up!

45:40.710 --> 45:42.420
But, sir, I just got here!

45:42.500 --> 45:45.830
Now! And fix yourself,
if I don't ask too much!

45:46.330 --> 45:48.960
If you get on the bus
before Hitler invades Poland,

45:49.250 --> 45:51.130
I'll buy everyone an ice cream.

45:53.790 --> 45:55.790
Very funny!

45:56.210 --> 45:57.540
Very funny!

45:58.170 --> 46:00.790
Which of you stole
my clothes, huh?

46:14.920 --> 46:17.580
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?

46:26.250 --> 46:30.460
Gas masks at Woolworths?
In short, where will the world go?

46:30.580 --> 46:33.460
She said to me: "You
better get used to it, dear,

46:33.540 --> 46:36.000
because soon there will
be a real catastrophe."

46:37.330 --> 46:39.080
It will be here somewhere.

46:39.250 --> 46:41.330
This is scary news.

46:41.420 --> 46:44.500
No, but when I think of that
terrible teacher, I get goosebumps.

46:44.580 --> 46:46.460
How, haven't you heard?

46:46.540 --> 46:47.960
He killed a colonel!

46:48.040 --> 46:51.290
He is said to be
a Nazi spy. <i>I...</i>

46:51.380 --> 46:53.880
- I need to make a phone call.
- Wait your turn.

46:54.960 --> 46:57.210
- Anyway, I was saying...
- It's really urgent.

46:57.290 --> 46:59.040
I have to do it now.

46:59.130 --> 47:00.670
Stan!

47:00.790 --> 47:02.750
Stan, this man wants
to get into the cabin!

47:02.880 --> 47:04.976
- What is he doing?
- I need to make a call right away.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.210
You have to wait for her turn.

47:06.330 --> 47:07.806
It's a government
matter, I have to do...

47:07.830 --> 47:09.790
Yes, yes, and I'm
Charlie Chaplin. Go away!

47:09.880 --> 47:11.960
- What is happening?
- He wants to taste a punch?

47:12.380 --> 47:13.460
- I am not joking.
- Ok, ok.

47:13.580 --> 47:16.460
Bravo, he goes away!
He entered an occupied cabin.

47:16.580 --> 47:18.000
- Come on!
- Are you OK?

47:18.080 --> 47:19.500
- That way.
- Are you OK?

48:11.380 --> 48:13.380
Hey! Ehi you!

48:14.880 --> 48:17.710
Hey! Hey!
Hey, you're wearing my uniform!

48:18.380 --> 48:20.210
You are blind? Hey, look at me!

48:20.920 --> 48:22.290
He took my uniform!

48:22.380 --> 48:25.130
It's my uniform! I tell you!
You think you are...

48:38.500 --> 48:41.080
Jackie!
Where do you think you're going?

48:41.170 --> 48:42.790
Hey! It's my uniform!

48:45.380 --> 48:47.040
Get it!

48:59.130 --> 49:04.130
JEW - KIND

49:41.080 --> 49:42.460
Boiled eggs and vinegar.

49:47.750 --> 49:49.750
They are used to heal bruises.

49:50.380 --> 49:51.630
So my mother said.

49:59.880 --> 50:02.040
- Sergeant...
- Sir?

50:09.880 --> 50:12.330
Captain Drey. Cabinet Office.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.880
I like his uniform, old sport.

50:14.960 --> 50:17.540
- It's not mine.
- Which makes you a thief...

50:17.830 --> 50:20.790
- He's a killer.
- And a spy.

50:20.960 --> 50:23.460
Corporal Willis is a meticulous

50:23.580 --> 50:24.880
man, don't you think he is?

50:25.540 --> 50:28.790
Yes. Let's not forget that he is a spy.

50:29.670 --> 50:31.630
- A German spy.
- What did I tell you?

50:35.080 --> 50:37.830
I hope you know
why you are here.

50:38.670 --> 50:41.330
He is accused of
killing Colonel Smith,

50:41.500 --> 50:45.330
esteemed citizen and
hero of the Great War.

50:46.210 --> 50:47.790
Contact my
superiors in Whitehall,

50:47.880 --> 50:49.710
they'll tell you I
worked for Smith.

50:49.790 --> 50:50.830
I didn't kill him.

50:54.630 --> 50:55.630
You call them.

50:56.500 --> 50:59.420
- The number?
- One-one-five-four.

51:01.330 --> 51:03.330
"Six minutes to midnight?"

51:05.630 --> 51:08.540
I haven't used that
number since Cable Street.

51:26.710 --> 51:28.750
Whitehall, one-one-five-four.

51:30.080 --> 51:33.380
I do not have much time.
Can you pass it to me or not?

51:33.960 --> 51:35.580
We are on the same side.

51:35.710 --> 51:38.170
Whitehall. One-one-five-four.

51:43.250 --> 51:47.880
MAN HUNT FOR MURDER

51:56.830 --> 51:58.040
Then?

51:58.130 --> 52:01.920
He hasn't been active since Uncle
Stanley's time. Nice try, Miller.

52:02.380 --> 52:04.000
Call again.

52:04.710 --> 52:06.080
But nobody answers.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.080
- Shall I start the car, sir?
- Thanks, Willis.

52:09.250 --> 52:10.500
Call them again.

52:11.460 --> 52:14.420
If he wants answers, he
has to call that number again.

52:14.540 --> 52:16.080
Make up another story, Miller.

52:16.170 --> 52:17.880
That's a piece of shit, right?

52:17.960 --> 52:19.420
Give me the key to the handcuffs.

52:22.670 --> 52:25.000
I know who killed Smith.
I found out the escape plans.

52:25.080 --> 52:27.580
I am not a German
spy, but a British agent!

52:31.040 --> 52:32.830
I collected the evidence.

52:32.920 --> 52:36.580
A list of Nazi
conspirators, British traitors.

52:37.540 --> 52:40.330
Get me out of here
so I can prove it to you.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.290
Show them to me.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.080
Get off.

53:18.460 --> 53:20.420
This is Miss Rocholl, I guess.

53:20.460 --> 53:21.460
Yup.

53:22.210 --> 53:24.250
What is it, why did you bring him here?

53:26.630 --> 53:28.000
I need to gather evidence.

53:28.670 --> 53:30.380
I don't want you
to disturb my girls.

53:31.580 --> 53:33.080
They are German, right?

53:33.960 --> 53:35.580
My girls are not the enemy.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.630
We will be discreet.

53:46.080 --> 53:47.380
Fraulein Keller?

53:53.130 --> 53:54.500
Can I help you in any way?

53:54.670 --> 53:56.790
First, you don't have
to move from here.

53:58.210 --> 54:00.460
Nobody leave this place!

54:00.960 --> 54:03.670
- I don't like her tone.
- The "if!

54:04.880 --> 54:06.710
No problem.

54:06.790 --> 54:08.500
They often tell me.

54:08.920 --> 54:10.460
Her room?

54:11.080 --> 54:12.790
Lead me through.

54:51.380 --> 54:54.420
Go into the garden,
until those men leave.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
Ok.

55:20.630 --> 55:21.630
So?

55:22.290 --> 55:23.960
I'm in the fireplace.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.380
Look inside.

55:34.710 --> 55:36.420
Found something?

55:49.710 --> 55:51.130
Give us a moment, Willis.

55:54.710 --> 55:56.330
It's an order, corporal.

56:08.040 --> 56:10.960
How careless, my
corporal has the keys.

56:12.420 --> 56:17.000
But don't worry. If in
here is what he told me,

56:17.920 --> 56:20.040
we will free it in the blink of an eye.

56:38.290 --> 56:40.580
Please excuse me for the music.

56:41.460 --> 56:44.170
After all that fuss, I
needed to calm down.

56:45.210 --> 56:46.630
It does not bother me.

56:49.710 --> 56:51.420
How much more time will you stay there?

56:51.880 --> 56:53.500
The time it takes.

56:58.710 --> 57:00.710
Would you like some tea?

57:03.750 --> 57:04.830
Thanks.

57:06.040 --> 57:07.210
<i>Use?</i>

57:08.580 --> 57:10.580
I'll tell the girls.

57:13.420 --> 57:14.630
Excuse me.

57:54.130 --> 57:56.130
How long have you been
working in this school?

57:56.630 --> 57:58.080
A little over a week.

57:58.170 --> 57:59.670
Tell me about Miss Keller.

57:59.750 --> 58:01.710
She-she Killed Smith.
- Because?

58:01.960 --> 58:03.920
We compromised your operation.

58:04.540 --> 58:08.330
The Germans were about to take the
girls and she found out we knew that.

58:08.920 --> 58:10.960
So his cover was blown.

58:15.790 --> 58:18.250
Was it just her and Smith?
Nobody else?

58:22.250 --> 58:24.920
What is he doing?
She cannot enter.

58:25.170 --> 58:28.170
- Why is he here?
- This is none of her business!

58:28.250 --> 58:30.130
If he has any questions,
he can ask my corporal.

58:30.210 --> 58:32.630
He is getting
impatient, so hurry up!

59:04.130 --> 59:09.420
If I had thoroughly searched his room, I
would have had no reason to come here.

59:10.580 --> 59:13.790
First Wheatley, now him.

59:14.830 --> 59:16.540
Are they ready for tonight?

59:17.500 --> 59:18.500
Yup.

59:20.130 --> 59:22.630
And you? Are you ready...

59:23.290 --> 59:25.290
To do what is necessary?

59:25.880 --> 59:28.750
Nothing will be left unfinished.

59:31.040 --> 59:32.210
Yup.

59:48.130 --> 59:51.000
I believe the word
you are looking for...

59:51.130 --> 59:52.960
Let <i>\</i> be dankel:

59:55.290 --> 59:57.000
Now leave us.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:07.000
- Gretel, what are you doing here?
- I was looking for you, Brother Keller.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.000
Out. Get out of here.

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.380
A war with Germany

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.750
would mark the end of England.

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:28.750
An alliance is the
only hope of surviving,

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.000
and to live in splendor.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.040
Salute to victory.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.040
Save your energy.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.960
You will have to be ready.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.960
Yup.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.330
Give me, leave it to me.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.460
My mother brushed my hair.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.960
She passed the brush

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.920
a hundred times.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500
And if she found a knot...

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.630
The hand.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.380
The hand.

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:48.710
What were you doing
outside Herr Miller's room?

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.330
What a cute girl.

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:01.710
Always there to observe.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:30.210
So you are not a teacher!

01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:32.210
No.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:35.580
She is English?

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.630
My mother was!

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:40.830
So is she a spy?

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.250
So it seems.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.460
Is your name Thomas?

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:46.250
Yup.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.630
Good. This chaos will kill her.
Get in!

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.670
I have to make a phone call.

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:51.290
Not here, man. I'm afraid
my phone isn't working.

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:54.380
Let's see.

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:58.170
It should be fine.

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:00.790
I'm going to get her some clothes.

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:11.750
Move, dude.

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.420
- Do the clothes fit you?
- Yes thanks.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.460
This will help her relax.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:19.750
What do you need the phone for?

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:25.540
My job is to prevent Ilse Keller from
taking the girls and information to Germany.

01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:28.000
Information?

01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:31.080
Details on the British
agents operating in the rear

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.080
What are you telling me?
Is war about to break out?

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.420
What will happen to the girls?

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.500
They will be held
as prisoners of war.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:46.330
The carefree
years last too short.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.960
Quick, she goes into hiding!

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.500
- I'll keep them busy.
- They are dangerous men.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.580
Don't waste time.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.960
Look inside the bus.

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:10.580
Whatever happens, you don't come
back inside, do you understand me?

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:12.210
At the right time you run away.

01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:14.880
Those girls deserve
better, like all of us.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.130
- Charlie!
- It was a pleasure!

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.290
Can I help you, gentlemen?

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.580
We have to go in, Charlie.

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:52.210
Just a moment.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.000
Old habits.

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:58.040
My wife will kill me
if we ruin the carpet.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.210
Where is your lady?

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.290
As I said, "old habits...

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:11.290
Did Thomas Miller hurt you?

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:14.130
Actually no, sir.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.460
Good for you.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.130
She took some clothes
and then ran away.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.630
Single malt.

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.960
"Old habits...

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:51.590
Something like that.
Would you like some tea?

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.170
Good idea, Charlie,
I can take care of it.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.630
Sit down, Charlie.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.000
Helping a foreign
spy is a betrayal.

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.080
You will be hanged.

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:45.790
Already.

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:49.080
It is not a smart move.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.880
So, are you a traitor, Charlie?

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.080
I'm not a traitor, sir.

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:59.580
He is half English,
that's why I helped him.

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.920
Very well.

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.130
Then,

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:15.960
where did he go?

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:32.170
Astrid! Beatrix! What are you doing?

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.420
The "if! The" if! What is happening?

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:40.170
I demand you give me an explanation!

01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:42.710
Are you taking my girls away?

01:09:44.290 --> 01:09:46.290
They were never "his".

01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:48.210
<i>The "if...</i>

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.210
Don't you dare to go out!

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.630
Stop immediately!

01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:55.630
Don't you dare to go out!
Stop immediately!

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.170
<i>The "if...</i>

01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:05.710
What happened to you?

01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:08.710
I grew up.

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:02.670
<i>Contact center. Number, please.</i>

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:05.420
Whitehall. One-one-five-four.

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.420
<i>Excuse me, can you repeat the number?</i>

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.710
Whitehall. One-one-five-four.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.920
<i>I put it in connection.</i>

01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.500
Ready?

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.290
Ready?

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:25.500
- Can you hear me?
- I hear it. <i>Loud</i> and clear.

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:28.460
<i>Tell me the exact time.</i>

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:31.330
Six minutes to midnight.

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:35.580
- Repeat, <i>please.
- </i> Six minutes to midnight!

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:37.040
<i>You have permission.</i>

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.580
This is Thomas Miller, send
a TX-84 to Bexhill-on-Sea!

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:42.460
<i>- Miller!
- Hello?</i>

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.380
Put it down!

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.750
<i>Agent Miller!</i>

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:47.266
<i>- Please repeat!
- </i> Get out of <i>there!</i>

01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:49.250
<i>Agent Miller! Please...</i>

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:02.920
What happens now?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.170
- We're taking her inside.
- Where is it?

01:12:05.290 --> 01:12:06.580
Where they will hang her.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.000
Corporal, ask the captain how
you know Fraulein Ilse Keller.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.080
Useless attempt.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.080
You tell the corporal what
information you gave you.

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:24.130
Should I handcuff him, sir?

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.750
No, it won't be necessary.

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:35.500
It's his fault, Miller.
If you remember that.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.580
<i>The German girls will depart from the
Suffolk Coast tonight, location unknown.</i>

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.670
<i>Send a plane to intercept.
There is no more time!</i>

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.670
Message received, Captain Miller.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.330
They are about to leave!
Alert the air defense fleet!

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:07.500
They'll take them away on the plane,
so you'll have to find an airport, Miller!

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:08.920
Yes but where?

01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:27.130
He arrived late.

01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:35.790
He took them away.

01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:39.290
All of them.

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:42.500
My girls.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.460
Stop! Please!

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.500
No!

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:11.920
Keep walking. There's no time.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.790
Always you, I would have bet.

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.330
Sorry, it's an old suitcase.

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.880
It's not her fault.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.040
My suitcase is too heavy.

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:31.250
Shall we walk to Germany?

01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:33.290
Or is it another of
her stupid exercises?

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.960
Don't make things
harder, Astrid.

01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:38.080
Stop!

01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:41.630
Keep walking!

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:46.750
Astrid, don't do this...

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:50.210
We will not follow it.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.580
Your family needs
you at home, Astrid.

01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.130
Who gives you these orders?

01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:00.460
Who gave her the power?

01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:03.880
It's not about power.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.420
- No?
- No.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:09.330
England doesn't want us.
Don't you understand?

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.080
I'm trying to protect you.

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:15.920
As?

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.290
What do you want to do, Fraulein Keller?

01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:22.290
We go back!

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.830
I admire your strength, Astrid.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.170
Start walking now! Get moving!

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:43.250
Get up!

01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:52.290
Come on, come on, move!

01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:56.040
I have to find the girls.
I'm in danger.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.960
They will take them away by plane.
Ilse told her about a place...

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.670
Isolated, flat where
a plane can land?

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:20.790
She'll serve her bread and
mustard and a beer pig's head.

01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:33.920
Beyond Pevensey Castle!
Along the beach.

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.580
I was there.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:41.960
Corporal Willis?

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:47.710
I'm dying.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:51.750
Go.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:54.670
Go!

01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:56.250
Wait!

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.290
If you thought for a second that you
could leave me here, you are wrong!

01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:09.710
Walk, girls. Walk.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.500
How many bullets are there?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.500
Who are you, Thomas Miller?

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.250
How many bullets?

01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:45.830
Five.

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.290
- She won't hurt them?
- I'm a secret agent.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.500
A spy.

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:56.630
- Do you work alone?
- Whitehall is coming.

01:18:58.330 --> 01:19:01.410
- What are they going to do with the girls?
- You don't have to fear for them.

01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:05.670
But if Ilse's mission
fails, no one will survive.

01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:09.000
I can not understand.

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:12.250
If Germany cannot catch
the girls, she will kill them.

01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:17.460
- But Ilse is one of them!
- Not anymore!

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:41.790
Stop!

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:47.130
Turn around!

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.670
Divide!

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.330
Stop!

01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:59.790
Turn around!

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.830
Turn around!

01:20:42.130 --> 01:20:44.130
I trusted her.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:48.080
I lived in a lie.

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.580
“Salute to victory”.

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:57.330
But there is nothing to win here.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.710
Wait!

01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:51.210
Prepare yourself!

01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:02.000
Now!

01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:27.670
God have mercy!

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.080
We are late.

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:44.960
We approach the location.
Visibility is good.

01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:04.290
Prepare for landing.

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:13.500
- We're under attack.
- Let's go up!

01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:26.540
No!

01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:00.380
Fraulein Keller?

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:09.170
- Fraulein Keller?
- You shut up!

01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:15.750
Drop the rockets.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.580
Come closer.

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:43.830
<i>Use '.!</i>

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.130
It's over.

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.290
Give up, it's over, Ilse!

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.540
If only she was right!

01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:08.380
Turn around.

01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:10.170
Turn around!

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:15.460
Ilse, don't do this.

01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:45.960
<i>Use '.!</i>

01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:59.750
What are you doing?

01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:20.210
<i>Use '.!</i>

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:23.710
<i>Use '.!</i>

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.710
It doesn't have to go this way!

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:34.960
Gretel, get away!

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.830
Gretel, you're freezing.

01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:19.710
<i>I...</i> was scared.

01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:23.170
You were brave,

01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.130
more than any of us.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.500
SUNDAY 3 SEPTEMBER

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.830
Where will he go, Mr. Miller?

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:19.960
The War Department is waiting for me.

01:28:20.710 --> 01:28:23.500
It seems my work is not done.

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.670
The girls will remain under his
tutelage until we make a decision.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.960
Not bad for a
“recommended teacher...

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:38.170
Faith and perseverance.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.250
Exact.

01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:54.580
Girls!

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.420
One two Three.

01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:59.000
<i>I'm talking to you from the
Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street.</i>

01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:05.380
<i>This morning, the British
ambassador to Berlin</i>

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:09.920
<i>handed the German
government an ultimatum...</i>

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.670
<i>In which it is stated that in the absence
of a confirmation by 11 this morning</i>

01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:21.040
<i>the immediate withdrawal of
German troops from Poland,</i>

01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:24.630
<i>the two nations would
enter a state of war.</i>

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.540
<i>I have to communicate to you</i>

01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:32.290
<i>that we have not received any
acceptance of the request made,</i>

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:33.790
<i>Consequently...</i>

01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:38.380
<i>Our country is at
war with Germany.</i>

01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:44.000
THE AUGUSTA VICTORIA FEMALE
COLLEGE IN BEXHILL-ON-SEA

01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:47.170
IT WAS THE FIRST AND LAST
COLLEGE OF THAT KIND IN ENGLAND.

01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:50.580
IT WAS OPEN FROM 1932
UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 1939.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.130
SIX MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT
