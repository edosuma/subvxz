03:13.401 --> 03:18.155
- How long will you be?
- Oh, I don't know. Uh, not very long.

03:31.293 --> 03:32.628
Carol?

03:34.547 --> 03:36.882
- Yes. Are you Michael?
- Yes.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.259
Nice to meet you.

03:38.342 --> 03:41.178
- Am I late?
- Not at all.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.974
- Brian was right. You are lovely.
- Oh, thank you.

03:45.057 --> 03:47.727
Uh, our dinner reservations aren't until 9:00.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.563
- Would you like a drink?
- Sure.

03:50.646 --> 03:53.232
You didn't have to drive.
I'd have been happy to pick you up.

03:53.315 --> 03:56.235
No, no, that's okay. Sometimes I have to work late.

03:56.318 --> 03:58.654
Anyway,
I prefer to drive myself.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.198
In case you need a quick getaway?

04:01.282 --> 04:03.909
I know how you feel.
Blind dates can be a bit grim sometimes.

04:08.748 --> 04:13.002
Ever since Brian joined the firm, he's been trying to marry me off.

04:13.669 --> 04:17.298
- Are you divorced?
- Uh, widower.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.841
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.804
What kind of work do you do?

04:23.888 --> 04:27.516
I work with a publishing company. I'm one of many editors.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.101
Believe me,
it's no big deal.

04:29.185 --> 04:33.147
I read manuscripts
and take a lot of work home at night.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.317
I've known Connie for years.

04:36.984 --> 04:40.780
After my divorce, I think she took me on
as something of a project.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.324
She thinks I work too hard.

04:43.949 --> 04:46.577
I hope you don't mind my asking, and, believe me, I'm thrilled that you did...

04:46.660 --> 04:49.580
but why did you accept a blind date?

04:51.999 --> 04:54.043
I don't know.

04:55.419 --> 04:57.171
You know, Connie was seeing Brian...

04:57.254 --> 05:00.508
and the three of us had been out to dinner a couple of times.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.052
He seemed like a really nice guy.

05:03.135 --> 05:08.057
And one clay Connie said that the senior partner
in Brian's law firm was coming to Los Angeles...

05:08.140 --> 05:11.477
and that you were
some kind of heavy-duty lawyer...

05:11.560 --> 05:13.562
supposed to be a really nice guy.

05:13.646 --> 05:18.150
I said I was busy.
And she said, what did I have to lose?

05:18.234 --> 05:21.487
The worst thing that could happen is
I'd have a nice meal in a good restaurant.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.240
Well, your friend's right about one thing:
Dinner will be very good.

05:24.323 --> 05:25.658
- Mr. Tarlow?
- Yes.

05:25.741 --> 05:27.701
- Message for you, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.286
Excuse me.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.795
I'm sorry but I have to go upstairs and make a phone call.

05:37.878 --> 05:41.757
- Anything serious?
- No, no, no. Just an anxious client.

05:42.299 --> 05:45.177
Would you like to come up?
I won't be very long.

05:45.719 --> 05:48.681
I know it sounds fishy. I feel really awkward.

05:48.764 --> 05:51.892
If you prefer to stay down here, it's fine. I'll just be a little while.

05:54.603 --> 05:56.897
No, it's all right. I'll come.

05:58.899 --> 06:00.234
Thank you.

06:04.029 --> 06:06.782
- Wow, this is beautiful.
- Yes, it is, isn't it?

06:06.866 --> 06:09.618
Have a look around. I'll just be a minute.

06:24.508 --> 06:26.886
Yeah, hi, it's Tarlow. Is he there?

06:30.639 --> 06:32.641
Are you sure?
I got a message to call him.

06:33.767 --> 06:37.897
Tell him I returned his call, okay?
Yeah, yeah, thank you. Okay. Bye.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.739
Leo?

06:47.781 --> 06:50.159
I just got a message to call you.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.201
Hello, Michael.

06:52.995 --> 06:56.415
- I thought you were in New Orleans.
- Yeah, but...

06:56.999 --> 06:59.835
I decided to come home a day early.

07:00.961 --> 07:04.340
Well, I wish you would have let me know.
I would have given you a call.

07:04.423 --> 07:07.635
No, there's no need for that now, is there?

07:08.552 --> 07:13.015
- You gonna invite us in?
- Uh, yeah. Sure. Excuse me.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.442
Wootton, this is Michael Tarlow, my lawyer.

07:23.525 --> 07:25.653
Michael, Jack Wootton.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.279
How do you do?

07:28.405 --> 07:30.824
Well, uh, sit down. Can I get you something to drink?

07:30.908 --> 07:32.409
No, thank you.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.955
- So, I take it you've been busy.
- Yeah.

07:36.038 --> 07:39.208
- What brings you to Los Angeles?
- I'm just closing the Gallway deal.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.252
I should have papers on your desk
by the end of the week.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.922
You didn't have to come all the way
out here just for that.

07:45.005 --> 07:47.091
- You could have clone it by phone.
- Well, you know how it is.

07:47.174 --> 07:50.302
When you do things face to face,
it's just a lot clearer.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.221
<i>1 agree.</i>

07:54.640 --> 07:57.518
You seem edgy, Michael.
That's not like you.

07:57.601 --> 07:59.228
No, I'm fine.

08:06.026 --> 08:08.070
<i>So, what can 1 do for you?</i>

08:08.153 --> 08:10.698
I have a problem. Need your advice.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.950
Now, that's what you pay me for.

08:13.033 --> 08:15.619
Yes, that's right. That's what I pay you for.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.289
There's a man who works for me.

08:19.373 --> 08:23.043
- He's close to me. I trusted him.
- So, what's the problem?

08:23.544 --> 08:26.839
The problem is that he got himself
into some financial trouble.

08:26.922 --> 08:29.508
He made some investments.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.928
He leveraged himself
up to his eyeballs.

08:33.011 --> 08:36.724
The investments didn't work out,
he got himself in serious debt.

08:36.807 --> 08:40.602
Now, this man didn't come to me
and tell me his problem.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.606
He didn't come to the man
who trusted him and ask for help.

08:45.315 --> 08:49.403
What he did was, he just took my money.
Took a lot of it.

08:49.486 --> 08:53.991
He was very clever,
so it was very hard to find out about.

08:54.074 --> 08:57.828
So, I need your advice, Michael.
What should I do with this man?

09:00.914 --> 09:04.168
- Leo...
- What do you think?

09:04.251 --> 09:07.588
- What would you do?
- Now, you-you don't understand, Leo.

09:07.671 --> 09:10.215
- I understand.
- No, I can explain it. I can.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.675
Good.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.886
I would like you to.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.514
It's not what you think. I would never...

09:17.598 --> 09:21.643
Please, Michael.
Have enough respect for me not to lie.

09:28.942 --> 09:32.196
<i>I. I was desperate, Leo.</i>

09:32.279 --> 09:35.991
<i>I took some funds from
the Con-Amakgate account, I...</i>

09:37.743 --> 09:39.703
To cover a loan. I...

09:41.371 --> 09:44.124
I was gonna pay you back, Leo!
I swear!

09:44.208 --> 09:46.668
I'm so disappointed in you,
Michael.

09:48.295 --> 09:52.257
For God's sake, you got to believe me!
You-you know I was gonna pay you back, Leo!

09:52.341 --> 09:54.093
Michael, don't be afraid.

09:55.052 --> 09:59.098
You're acting like you think I'll harm you.
Michael...

09:59.181 --> 10:01.934
Even though we were close...

10:02.017 --> 10:04.937
even though you betrayed me,
and I trusted you...

10:05.020 --> 10:08.023
I would never harm you.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.275
Here's what you're going to do:

10:11.443 --> 10:13.946
You're going to go back to New York.

10:14.029 --> 10:17.449
Someone else will close the Gallway deal.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.910
I will never do business with you again.

10:19.993 --> 10:23.413
You will pay me back what you owe,
with interest.

10:23.497 --> 10:28.043
If you have to sell your nice apartment
with the David Hockneys on the wall...

10:28.127 --> 10:31.755
then you'll do that. You will pay me back.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.091
I will never speak to you again.

10:34.174 --> 10:35.634
You're right, Michael.

10:35.717 --> 10:38.262
It's better to talk
these things over face to face.

10:38.345 --> 10:40.472
It's clearer that way.

10:43.433 --> 10:46.603
Goodbye, Michael. Don't get up.

10:48.605 --> 10:49.565
Oh, Michael?

10:51.066 --> 10:52.734
I lied.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.633
Yeah?

13:24.094 --> 13:25.929
Caulfield here.

13:27.639 --> 13:29.141
What?

13:30.142 --> 13:32.144
How soon can you be here?

13:32.644 --> 13:34.938
Five minutes is too long.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.440
Rig ht.

13:49.828 --> 13:52.581
- He's in a conference.
- Right.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.919
Good morning.
Won't you come in?

13:58.003 --> 14:00.589
Martin, James, detective sergeant Benti.

14:00.672 --> 14:01.882
Nice to meet you.

14:01.965 --> 14:05.010
This is James Dahlbeck.
Like Caulfield, he's a deputy D.A.

14:05.093 --> 14:07.262
He goes to trial tomorrow
with the Atwater case.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.057
That's what we were in the middle of discussing.
That's why my door was closed.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.602
I believe it's called a conference.

14:13.685 --> 14:15.937
Remember those latents that we found
on the bathroom glass...

14:16.021 --> 14:19.399
- in Michael Tarlow's hotel suite?
- Yes. They never checked out.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.109
They didn't check out in California.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.321
While the city sleeps, detective sergeant
Benti's been hard at work.

14:24.404 --> 14:27.616
- I'm impressed.
- Go ahead, detective sergeant.

14:27.699 --> 14:29.701
Make me look good.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.247
We ran those prints through the federal computer.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.375
Turns out they belong to one Carol Hunnicut.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.503
She's arrested for disorderly conduct
in 1981, in Oregon.

14:39.586 --> 14:42.881
Some kind of anti-nuke bullshit.
She works for a publishing company.

14:42.964 --> 14:45.759
She hasn't been there
since the clay Tarlow bought the bar.

14:45.842 --> 14:48.428
- This is riveting.
- Give 'im a minute, he'll get your attention.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.305
I checked through our logs.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.183
Two clays after Tarlow got ice, we got a call.

14:53.266 --> 14:56.436
Some broad by the name of Constance Billings
said her friend was missing.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.729
She seemed upset.

14:57.813 --> 15:00.107
We told her she could come in
and file a missing persons report.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.860
Seemed to change 'er mind, and said maybe
her friend just went away for a few days.

15:03.944 --> 15:08.031
She never gave us the friend's full name.
Just the first. Carol.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.659
- Are you with us so far?
- I'm holding my own.

15:10.742 --> 15:14.287
I got the address of this Constance Billings,
and I went to see her this morning.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.914
Really early.

15:15.997 --> 15:20.210
You see them before they had their
first coffee, and they rattle easier.

15:21.753 --> 15:25.715
Oh, she didn't wanna see me from nothing.
She said she didn't know anything.

15:25.799 --> 15:29.469
She had total amnesia. She was scared shitless.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.721
I told her we'd protect her
and her friend if she helped us...

15:31.805 --> 15:33.014
but we couldn't protect her if she didn't.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.978
She was as easy to crack as a raw egg.
Then she comes out with it.

15:38.061 --> 15:42.190
The reason why this Hunnicut broad's
fingerprints were on the bathroom glass...

15:42.274 --> 15:45.610
is because she was in the hotel suite
when Tarlow got hit.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.655
She saw it. She was there.

15:50.073 --> 15:52.409
It gets better.

15:57.205 --> 15:59.332
It gets a lot better.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.626
Guess who was in the room
with the button man?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.296
- You're kidding?
- Leo fucking Watts.

16:04.379 --> 16:05.922
In person. In living color.

16:06.006 --> 16:10.260
The woman was in the other room.
She saw everything. Everything.

16:10.343 --> 16:12.471
- Nobody knew about her. They still don't.
- Where is she?

16:12.554 --> 16:14.806
She understandably freaked and took off.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.350
She called her friend from the road,
told her what had happened...

16:17.434 --> 16:19.102
and that she was still alive.

16:19.186 --> 16:23.315
She's hiding out in a cabin
some place in East, Jesus.

16:23.398 --> 16:25.609
- There is a God.
- Unbelievable.

16:25.692 --> 16:28.320
I've chartered a plane.
It'll fly into a small strip.

16:28.403 --> 16:30.947
We'll be met by a helicopter,
flown to where she is...

16:31.031 --> 16:33.450
I'll pick her up,
come back the same way.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.828
Nobody knows anything about her.
Leo's in for a nice surprise.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.039
While I get her tucked away,
here you get your warrant.

16:39.122 --> 16:41.082
- What if she won't talk?
- Oh, she'll talk.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.251
- You know this for a fact?
- Yeah, she'll talk.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.546
I'll promise her protection,
I'll offer her relocation.

16:46.630 --> 16:47.672
She'll talk. She has to.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.675
Don't you think you ought to find out if she's
gonna cooperate before you go to see her?

16:50.759 --> 16:53.178
Well, there's no phone in this place.
Anyway, she might just take off.

16:53.261 --> 16:55.055
- Where is this place?
- It's up in Canada.

16:55.138 --> 16:56.932
I can't authorize that kind of expenditure...

16:57.015 --> 16:59.434
without checking with the director
of branch and area operations.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.020
You know that. I have to follow procedure.

17:02.103 --> 17:05.232
This is Leo Watts we're talking about.
We've got him for murder one.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.652
- You understand what that means?
- Yes, I do.

17:08.734 --> 17:11.655
- I still have to check.
- What's the matter with you?

17:11.738 --> 17:14.657
- There's nothing the matter with me.
- Why are you doing this again with Watts?

17:14.741 --> 17:17.493
- Doing what?
- Last year we had a chance at him.

17:17.577 --> 17:20.829
And you put me in your bureaucratic blender,
and we lost 'im.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.165
Your idea of a chance at him...

17:22.249 --> 17:25.585
was uncorroborated statements
from an informant who was doing hard time...

17:25.669 --> 17:27.878
and who would sell his own mother
to get his sentence reduced.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.924
As a matter of fact, I think he did
actually try to sell his mother once...

17:31.007 --> 17:33.510
except she'd been dead for 10 years.

17:33.593 --> 17:36.388
You wanna make the announcement?
That's what you're worried about?

17:36.471 --> 17:39.516
I realize television cameras
are something of an aphrodisiac to you.

17:39.599 --> 17:43.144
You can be on the 11 o'clock news.
Does that satisfy you?

17:47.357 --> 17:48.942
Our job is to convict criminals...

17:49.025 --> 17:51.444
not to bring them to trial
and then have them acquitted.

17:51.528 --> 17:55.574
I'm gonna conduct business here in a proper
and orderly way, whether it pleases you or not.

17:55.657 --> 18:00.620
While we're on the subject, I don't think
I like the implications of what you're saying.

18:01.329 --> 18:02.831
Let's go.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.419
We're going.

18:08.628 --> 18:11.590
- We're going now.
- Not without my authorization.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.151
Why does he have to fly so low?

18:31.234 --> 18:34.779
We're not low. The ground's high.

18:35.322 --> 18:39.868
- See? Now we're high.
- I hate these things.

18:39.951 --> 18:41.578
Sorry, sir.

18:41.661 --> 18:44.914
Just a little turbulence in the thermals
on the windward side of the mountain.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.875
I don't wanna know about thermals!

18:46.958 --> 18:51.421
Well, sir, if nothing else, you do have to admit
there's a pretty spectacular scenery out there.

18:51.504 --> 18:53.548
If I want scenery, I'll get a postcard.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.718
- How much longer?
- We'll be there in less than 5 minutes, sir.

18:56.801 --> 19:00.597
- Too long.
- What do you think she looks like?

19:00.680 --> 19:04.559
I don't care what she looks like.
I don't like the company she keeps.

19:05.226 --> 19:06.936
You realize, when we go down...

19:07.020 --> 19:10.690
nobody's gonna be able to find us
except some fucking moose.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.986
You think top gun up there will be able
to tell if somebody's following us?

19:15.070 --> 19:17.447
Like what, a condor?

19:20.075 --> 19:21.826
There it is.

19:39.719 --> 19:42.514
Keep the motor running, okay?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.401
It's warm.

20:06.329 --> 20:08.164
Miss Hunnicut!

20:08.248 --> 20:12.877
I'm detective sergeant Dominick Benti,
Los Angeles Police Department!

20:12.961 --> 20:17.382
With me is deputy District Attorney
Robert Caulfield!

20:19.050 --> 20:23.471
Miss Hunnicut, we know you're in there!
We'll wait out here all clay if we have to!

20:23.555 --> 20:27.225
Real cold out here! Hope we don't have to!

20:32.772 --> 20:35.692
Can I see some identification, please?

20:48.121 --> 20:50.832
- What do you want?
- I think you know what we want.

20:50.915 --> 20:52.959
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:53.042 --> 20:57.422
You were witness to a murder.
We'd like you to come back and testify.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.843
I never saw anything.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.720
How did you find me?

21:03.803 --> 21:06.514
A friend of yours, Constance Billings,
told us where you were.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.685
- She said you saw a lot.
- I have nothing to say to you.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.897
You wouldn't happen to have a drink
in there, would you?

21:13.980 --> 21:17.275
- You're on duty.
- I only drink when I'm on duty.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.903
How do I know you men
are who you say you are?

21:19.986 --> 21:21.196
<i>You saw our ID.</i>

21:21.279 --> 21:24.532
Well, I wouldn't know
a real one from a fake one.

21:24.616 --> 21:28.578
If we were gonna do you some harm,
we would have clone it already.

21:34.125 --> 21:37.253
- There's coffee on the stove.
- Do you have any beer?

21:37.337 --> 21:40.507
- No.
- Nice place.

21:40.590 --> 21:44.511
- Thanks.
- Jesus! She really doesn't have beer.

21:45.261 --> 21:48.681
Miss Hunnicut, we'd really like
to have you come back and testify.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.183
I'm not gonna go anywhere with you.

21:50.266 --> 21:52.477
I didn't see anything, I don't know anything.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.104
I am not going to testify.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.148
- Aren't you pleasant.
- Yes, when I wanna be.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.359
Look, gentlemen,
I really have nothing to say to you.

21:59.442 --> 22:02.320
- I would like you to leave.
- You don't realize the situation you're in.

22:02.403 --> 22:06.074
I know exactly the situation I'm in.

22:06.157 --> 22:08.368
I don't think you do. We can protect you.

22:08.451 --> 22:12.622
- If you stay here, they're gonna find you.
- There's no reason to come after me.

22:12.705 --> 22:15.250
I'm not testifying.

22:15.333 --> 22:18.837
- I've a subpoena.
- Let me see it.

22:21.130 --> 22:23.842
- I can get one.
- I think you should leave.

22:23.925 --> 22:28.137
Lady, you're kidding yourself.
You think those guys would come up here...

22:28.221 --> 22:31.558
you being the one person who could
put Leo Watts in the gas chamber...

22:31.641 --> 22:33.977
you'll tell them you're not gonna testify...

22:34.060 --> 22:36.604
and they'd say, "Wow, that's a relief. Thanks.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.191
You have a nice clay."
Then they'd turn around and go home?

22:40.275 --> 22:43.152
- Is that what you believe?
- They'd never find me.

22:43.236 --> 22:46.239
- We did.
- I'll take my chances.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.711
- Have the keys to that car out there?
- On the table.

23:04.966 --> 23:07.260
I don't suppose there's a back door
to this place, is there?

23:07.343 --> 23:08.720
No.

23:08.803 --> 23:12.974
- How 'bout a window?
- Yes. It's in the bathroom.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.298
You get to that window, all right?

23:45.381 --> 23:47.675
Keep quiet. Keep low. You wait for me there.

23:47.759 --> 23:48.843
Go! Go!

24:39.060 --> 24:40.520
Now!

25:05.962 --> 25:08.006
I can't believe that. What have you clone to me?

25:08.089 --> 25:09.799
<i>Nobody knew where 1 was.</i>

25:09.882 --> 25:13.052
I'm sorry. How the hell would I know
they were following us?

25:13.136 --> 25:16.014
Aren't you supposed to know that?
Isn't that your job?

25:16.097 --> 25:18.391
How could you be stupid enough
to let somebody follow you?

25:18.474 --> 25:20.560
Where's the closest town?
Some place with a telephone?

25:20.643 --> 25:23.646
8 miles down this road.

27:19.345 --> 27:21.681
The train's slowing down.
How far to the station?

27:21.764 --> 27:23.891
About a half a mile.

28:39.842 --> 28:41.510
Let's go.

29:12.750 --> 29:16.212
Excuse me. Where's the closest big town?

29:16.295 --> 29:19.757
- I beg your pardon?
- A big city, you know, one with an airport...

29:19.840 --> 29:23.177
- where's the nearest one?
- Well, if you go east, about 100 miles.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.888
- Which way is this train heading?
- Well, it goes west, of course.

29:25.972 --> 29:29.475
- Damn.
- Vancouver's as big as you get.

29:29.558 --> 29:31.352
This train goes to Vancouver.

29:31.435 --> 29:34.689
- How long's that take?
- You arrive Vancouver 10:40 in the morning.

29:34.772 --> 29:37.525
You're kidding. No, you're not kidding...

29:38.567 --> 29:43.406
- I'd like a private compartment, please.
- I'm sorry, all we got left is coach seats.

29:43.489 --> 29:46.993
- I have to have a private compartment.
- Then wait until tomorrow.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.996
Another train will come through.
I'll see if we got space on that.

29:50.079 --> 29:52.665
No, you don't understand.
I have to be on that train.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.672
Well, I'd like to help you out, mister.
There's nothing I can do.

29:59.755 --> 30:01.966
- I have to be able to lie down.
- She has to lie down.

30:02.049 --> 30:05.303
If I go into labor again,
I have be able to lie down.

30:05.386 --> 30:08.889
Well, the baby isn't clue
for another two weeks, but...

30:08.973 --> 30:12.101
- I have to be able to lie down.
- Well, don't worry, honey, it's okay...

30:12.184 --> 30:14.937
Excuse me, sir. I couldn't help overhearing.

30:15.021 --> 30:16.939
My wife and I, we have a compartment...

30:17.023 --> 30:19.525
and you kids look as though
you need it more than we do.

30:19.608 --> 30:22.278
- Oh, we couldn't do that.
- No, please. I insist.

30:22.361 --> 30:25.281
I remember how it was with our... Mark.

30:25.364 --> 30:28.701
- This your first?
- Yes. That's very kind of you. Thank you.

30:28.784 --> 30:30.911
- I'm gonna pay for both tickets.
- Oh, well...

30:30.995 --> 30:32.580
No, I insist.

30:32.663 --> 30:35.249
- Is there a phone on the train?
- Afraid not.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.418
195 dollars, please.

30:39.045 --> 30:42.882
That's car 564, drawing room A.

30:42.965 --> 30:46.218
- It's toward the end of the train.
- Okay. Thank you.

30:50.723 --> 30:53.559
You get on the train, okay? Don't wait for me.

30:53.642 --> 30:55.353
Get in the drawing room, lock the door.

30:55.436 --> 30:58.022
Don't let anybody in. Don't answer for anybody, all right?

30:58.105 --> 31:01.359
They probably haven't seen you. All right. Here.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.819
Go. Go.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.952
- I'm really very grateful.
- That's quite all right.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.163
- Thank you.
- You take care of the little lady now.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.351
- Yes?
- I believe there's been some mistake.

33:40.434 --> 33:43.479
- This is my compartment.
- Well, if there's been a mistake, it's yours.

33:43.562 --> 33:45.356
- This is our compartment.
- Are you sure?

33:45.439 --> 33:48.067
Yes, of course I'm sure. Now, could you please excuse us?

33:48.150 --> 33:50.528
Well, the conductor told me this was mine.

33:50.611 --> 33:53.989
The conductor couldn't have said that.
This is our compartment.

33:54.073 --> 33:58.410
- Could I see your ticket, please?
- Can I see yours?

33:58.494 --> 34:02.831
- My wife has our tickets.
- Maybe your wife is in the proper car.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.626
This is my son. This is not your wife.

34:05.709 --> 34:09.004
This is our compartment, not yours. I would like you to leave.

34:09.088 --> 34:11.549
This guy's lying.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.092
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, really.

34:14.176 --> 34:17.054
I'm always getting myself into these kinds of things.

34:17.137 --> 34:20.849
One time, I lost my car.

34:20.933 --> 34:25.688
I parked it in a parking lot and
I just I forgot where I parked it. I just...

34:27.523 --> 34:30.150
- You know what that's like.
- No, I don't know what that's like.

34:30.234 --> 34:34.196
- Would you please get out of here?
- Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

34:42.079 --> 34:44.873
- Is this car 564?
- No.

34:44.956 --> 34:48.252
Ah, well. There you are, you see?
I've clone it again.

34:48.335 --> 34:53.132
- I'm supposed to be in car 564.
- Well, maybe you should go to car 564.

34:53.215 --> 34:57.428
- You wouldn't happen to know where that car is?
- No, I wouldn't.

34:57.511 --> 34:59.888
He's lying, mom. He's a train robber.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.974
What would I want with a train?

35:02.057 --> 35:06.186
- Do you have a gun?
- Yeah, I guess I should go see the conductor.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.897
He would know where car 564 is, wouldn't you think?

35:08.981 --> 35:11.233
I would expect so. Why don't you do that?

35:11.317 --> 35:16.363
I'll do that. I'll go find him and
I'll just ask him where car 564 really is.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.157
Good idea.

35:18.240 --> 35:22.411
Well, uh,
sorry for the inconvenience.

35:27.249 --> 35:30.377
- You folks have a nice trip.
- You, too.

35:38.260 --> 35:39.803
It's me, Caulfield.

35:42.931 --> 35:44.558
- How you doing?
- I've been better.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.226
Yeah, me too.

35:46.810 --> 35:49.980
- So, we expecting company?
- There's two of 'em.

35:50.064 --> 35:53.400
It's no gonna take them very long to find this compartment.

35:56.862 --> 36:00.199
- I'm getting off at the next stop.
- That's impossible.

36:00.282 --> 36:03.827
- You watch me.
- We'd be sitting ducks out there.

36:03.911 --> 36:08.374
- Who said anything about "we"?
- You're going out there alone?

36:09.500 --> 36:12.544
We're in the middle of a goddamn wilderness,
in case you haven't noticed.

36:12.628 --> 36:15.005
Take a look out the window,
for Christ's sakes.

36:15.089 --> 36:17.925
You're going out there on foot? Well, that should be a breeze.

36:18.008 --> 36:19.843
I've a much better chance to protect you in here.

36:19.927 --> 36:24.056
Protect me? You're the one who put me in danger.

36:26.975 --> 36:29.603
I'm not stupid, Mr. Caulfield.

36:30.604 --> 36:34.441
I'm not gonna survive stuck on this train until tomorrow.

36:35.109 --> 36:37.986
Let me tell you something. A police officer died...

36:38.070 --> 36:42.116
trying to help get you back to Los Angeles. He was a good man.

36:42.241 --> 36:45.077
I'm gonna get you back there, I promise.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.788
I can't tell you what a comfort that is.

36:47.871 --> 36:51.041
- I don't think I like you.
- So the weekend in Paris is off?

36:51.125 --> 36:55.045
You got a big mouth. At least you can put it
to good use on the witness stand.

36:55.129 --> 36:59.258
I don't think you hear very well.
I am not testifying at this trial.

36:59.341 --> 37:00.718
You still don't get it, do you?

37:00.801 --> 37:03.220
These guys are grownups,
they got automatic weapons.

37:03.303 --> 37:06.306
It doesn't matter what you tell them,
when they see you, they're gonna kill you.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.183
We got two things going for us.

37:08.267 --> 37:11.270
One, they've seen me, they might not have seen you.

37:11.353 --> 37:13.439
- They might not know what you look like.
- And?

37:13.522 --> 37:14.857
And...

37:15.733 --> 37:20.154
- We got one thing going for us.
- Ancl I've got you to protect me...

37:23.282 --> 37:26.452
- Who is it?
- Conductor, sir.

37:26.535 --> 37:29.830
- Uh, yes?
- I'm sorry to disturb you.

37:29.913 --> 37:32.708
A gentleman has lost his briefcase.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.835
Yeah...

37:40.132 --> 37:46.472
Well, we think maybe the porter left it
in one of these compartments by mistake.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.808
- We're checking the whole car.
- It's not in here.

37:49.892 --> 37:53.395
- You're welcome to take a look if you'd like.
- Thank you.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.946
- I guess it's not in here.
- I guess not.

38:03.030 --> 38:05.866
I'm sure it's in this car some place.

38:05.949 --> 38:07.868
Maybe not.

38:09.703 --> 38:14.416
We'll keep looking.
I'm sorry to have bothered you, sir.

38:22.216 --> 38:25.052
- He'll be back, won't he?
- Yeah.

38:25.135 --> 38:28.263
- How do we stop him?
- We don't.

38:28.347 --> 38:30.933
<i> Want me to set out some hors d'oeuvres?</i>

38:31.016 --> 38:34.228
I want you to do exactly
what I tell you to do.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.546
Excuse me.
I wasn't looking where I was going.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.715
Oh, that's quite all right, sir.

40:27.382 --> 40:29.593
Operator, I wanna make a collect call
to James Dahlbeck.

40:29.676 --> 40:33.305
My name is Caulfield.
C-a-u-l-f-i-e-l-d.

40:49.404 --> 40:51.573
Caulfield.
Where the hell are you?

40:51.657 --> 40:53.700
<i>- I'm on a train.</i>
- <i>You're on</i> a what?

40:53.784 --> 40:56.787
<i>We were followed.</i>
Sergeant Benti is dead.

40:56.870 --> 40:58.080
That's impossible.

40:58.163 --> 41:00.707
It seems strange that
Larner doesn't wanna send me up here...

41:00.791 --> 41:02.167
<i>and then we're followed.
It doesn't make sense.</i>

41:02.250 --> 41:04.670
- No, you're-you're way off base.
- Oh, you think so?

41:04.753 --> 41:07.339
Two times in one year he tries to stop me.

41:07.422 --> 41:09.925
That's stretching coincidence a little bit.
<i>Don't you think?</i>

41:10.008 --> 41:13.303
- I don't what to say.
- Well, don't say anything. Just listen.

41:13.387 --> 41:16.223
There's at least two guys following us.
One of the men has an automatic weapon.

41:16.306 --> 41:18.100
Maybe they both do, I don't know.

41:18.183 --> 41:20.644
The helicopter was destroyed, and the pilot is dead.

41:20.727 --> 41:23.522
<i>The perps are still on the train, okay?
They've seen me.</i>

41:23.605 --> 41:25.649
<i>I don't think they've seen the girl.
They don't know what the girl looks like.</i>

41:25.732 --> 41:30.153
But they sure as hell know what I look like.
I don't think we can stay on the train.

41:39.496 --> 41:42.666
- Where the hell is this train?
<i>- We're heading West towards Vancouver.</i>

41:42.749 --> 41:44.584
We're gonna be there
about 10 o'clock in the morning.

41:44.668 --> 41:47.004
I don't think we can hold out
that long before they find her.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.172
Where's the next stop?

41:50.340 --> 41:52.843
Town called Monashee.
We'll be in there about midnight.

41:52.926 --> 41:56.805
All right. All right. Do what you can
to keep the girl hidden until then.

41:56.888 --> 41:59.683
- I'll have you met at the next station.
- Well, listen.

41:59.766 --> 42:03.061
- Don't say anything to Larner about this.
- I won't.

42:03.145 --> 42:06.898
- Hey, uh... You hang in there.
- Yeah, sure.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.828
He's gone.

43:46.748 --> 43:51.002
We're changing cars. This one is getting too popular.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.592
We get into the next station around midnight.

43:57.676 --> 43:59.886
There'll be some people there to meet us.

44:03.682 --> 44:07.394
- Then we can get off this damn train.
- Oh, thank God.

44:14.943 --> 44:17.571
Now, these guys can't just go
blasting everybody in sight.

44:17.654 --> 44:19.656
They're professionals. They...

44:19.739 --> 44:24.411
start a war on a train in the boondocks,
they got a good chance of being caught.

44:27.289 --> 44:32.460
They have to find you, do it cleanly,
without drawing attention to themselves.

44:34.504 --> 44:36.965
As long as they don't know where you are, you're okay.

44:38.592 --> 44:40.719
It's gonna be okay, really.

44:41.261 --> 44:43.388
I'm telling you, it's gonna be all right.

44:43.471 --> 44:45.557
I'm not going
to Los Angeles with you.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.976
I'm telling you right now,
I'm not going.

44:48.059 --> 44:50.228
- Are you hungry?
- Oh, I don't know.

44:50.312 --> 44:51.646
I'll go to the club car to get you something to eat.

44:51.730 --> 44:52.981
I'm not hungry.

44:53.064 --> 44:56.067
You lock this door behind me.
Don't let the porter or the conductor...

44:56.151 --> 44:59.779
- I said I'm not hungry.
- You need something to eat.

44:59.863 --> 45:03.033
- Okay, you stay, and I'll go.
- What?

45:03.116 --> 45:05.035
Every time you leave this compartment...

45:05.160 --> 45:08.205
and every time you come back, you put me in danger.

45:08.288 --> 45:11.499
Listen, they know what you look like.
They don't know what I look like.

45:11.583 --> 45:15.921
- I've a better chance if I go myself.
- Suppose that they do know what you look like.

45:16.004 --> 45:18.882
Maybe they've seen you. Maybe your photograph was faxed...

45:18.965 --> 45:21.259
along with your fingerprints when they checked you out.

45:21.343 --> 45:22.260
Wanna risk that?

45:22.344 --> 45:25.472
You're not going to that club car
because you're wanna bring me food.

45:25.555 --> 45:27.891
Lock the door behind me.

46:04.552 --> 46:07.347
- May I get you something to drink, sir?
- Yeah, a beer, please.

46:07.430 --> 46:10.392
- What kind of beer would you like?
- Oh, I don't know. You choose.

46:10.475 --> 46:12.102
Yes, sir.

46:15.230 --> 46:17.565
I'm terribly sorry!

46:18.191 --> 46:19.901
- It's all right.
- Does it hurt?

46:19.985 --> 46:21.861
It's okay. It's just my foot.

46:21.945 --> 46:24.322
I can grow another one in a week.

46:24.406 --> 46:27.826
- I'm so clumsy. I'm sorry.
- It's all right, really. It's not you.

46:27.909 --> 46:29.327
It's the train. It's very bumpy, that's all.

46:29.411 --> 46:32.789
No, no, it's me. I'm always doing things like that.

46:34.374 --> 46:37.544
- I'm sorry again.
- It's okay. It's okay. It's the same foot.

46:37.627 --> 46:39.462
Oh, gee!

46:40.046 --> 46:43.008
- Can I buy you something to drink?
- No, that's not necessary.

46:43.091 --> 46:45.302
- I'd like to.
- I'm fine, really.

46:45.385 --> 46:48.471
I insist. I am clumsy, but I have money.

46:48.555 --> 46:51.057
Well, I'm not that liberated yet.

46:51.141 --> 46:54.978
I'll have the same, please.
And this... is for both of them.

46:55.061 --> 46:56.146
- Sure.
- Here, let me...

46:56.229 --> 46:58.106
No, no, no, it's clone.

46:58.189 --> 47:02.527
- Was it so difficult, was it?
- I feel like Phil Donahue.

47:03.570 --> 47:07.198
- My name's Kathryn Weller.
- I'm Robert Caulfield.

47:07.282 --> 47:09.159
- How are you?
- Good.

47:11.911 --> 47:13.997
You don't look like somebody who takes the train.

47:14.080 --> 47:18.793
Oh, really? What does somebody who takes the train look like?

47:18.877 --> 47:20.420
Patient.

47:20.503 --> 47:22.714
Yeah, it's the first time I've done this.

47:24.466 --> 47:26.593
- No, that's fine.
- Thank you, ma'am.

47:26.676 --> 47:29.095
How about you?
Do you do this often?

47:29.179 --> 47:31.139
No, not often. I, uh...

47:32.432 --> 47:34.642
I was trying to water-ski on Lake Louise. I...

47:34.726 --> 47:37.312
I wasn't very good at it. I tend to fall down a lot.

47:37.395 --> 47:39.397
I noticed.

47:41.316 --> 47:46.488
- I'm also terrified of flying, so...
- Really? I don't mind that at all.

47:46.571 --> 47:48.698
I'm in no rush.

47:48.782 --> 47:51.534
The one thing I have is time.

47:53.119 --> 47:55.789
You also said you had money.

47:55.872 --> 47:58.958
I had a good divorce lawyer.

48:03.671 --> 48:07.801
- Am I interrupting you?
- No, no, I'm sorry, really.

48:09.135 --> 48:11.805
Well, here's to community property.

48:13.348 --> 48:16.601
Come to think of it, I earned it.

48:19.062 --> 48:23.191
- Are you... traveling alone?
- Yes.

48:25.527 --> 48:27.862
How long were you married?

48:27.946 --> 48:29.864
Six years.

48:30.448 --> 48:33.618
One clay, over bran muffins - he loved bran muffins -

48:33.701 --> 48:37.330
he said he had to find himself. Just like that.

48:37.414 --> 48:42.210
I'm standing there with a pot of brewed decaf -
he only drank brewed decaf -

48:42.293 --> 48:44.337
and he said he had to find himself.

48:44.421 --> 48:47.173
I asked him if he wanted to finish breakfast first.

48:47.257 --> 48:49.884
Before I knew it, he had taken his air popcorn maker -

48:49.968 --> 48:51.469
no cholesterol, you see -

48:51.553 --> 48:54.597
and his lifecycle and moved into this very nice duplex...

48:54.681 --> 48:57.267
with a 23-year-old waitress
from one of his restaurants.

48:57.350 --> 48:59.561
Not bad for somebody who's lost.

48:59.644 --> 49:03.940
Well, he owns a lot of restaurants,
so I don't think he'll run out of waitresses.

49:04.023 --> 49:06.359
You'll have to excuse me.

49:06.443 --> 49:09.028
I'm sorry, I've been talking too much. I tend to do that.

49:09.112 --> 49:11.156
- No, it's not, you know.
- I understand.

49:11.239 --> 49:14.701
No, you don't understand, really. I wish I could explain, but...

49:14.784 --> 49:18.037
By the way, I think your restaurant guy is nuts.

49:57.660 --> 50:00.371
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- I'll back up.

50:00.455 --> 50:02.999
- It's shorter this way.
- I appreciate that.

50:03.082 --> 50:06.628
These things weren't designed for people my size.

50:08.171 --> 50:12.217
No one loves a fat man but his grocer.

50:27.357 --> 50:31.861
- Did you find your briefcase yet, sir?
- No, not yet.

50:31.945 --> 50:34.489
Your seats are up at the head of the train, aren't they?

50:34.572 --> 50:37.534
Yes, that's right. I get mixed up.

50:37.617 --> 50:41.079
- Well, it can be confusing, sir.
- Thank you.

51:01.641 --> 51:04.519
Please. I'm not gonna hurt you.

51:10.650 --> 51:12.652
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:37.635 --> 51:40.972
- You're supposed to say something.
- Like what?

51:42.432 --> 51:45.435
- Something reassuring.
- It's gonna work out.

51:48.146 --> 51:51.024
Thanks.
That made a world of difference.

51:52.525 --> 51:56.029
We'll be in the station soon.
You'll be safe when we get there.

51:58.323 --> 52:02.493
I hope they've gotten to your cabin by now
and have taken care of Benti.

52:03.453 --> 52:07.915
- He shouldn't be left alone like that.
- I'm sorry about your friend.

52:07.999 --> 52:10.668
He ain't my friend. I...

52:13.004 --> 52:15.381
I just met 'im.

52:18.384 --> 52:19.844
Jerk.

52:20.470 --> 52:23.014
Two years away from retirement.

52:23.848 --> 52:26.434
- I'm sorry.
- Are you?

52:27.560 --> 52:29.479
There are two guys on this train.

52:29.562 --> 52:31.898
One is that killed a police officer and a pilot.

52:31.981 --> 52:35.485
I couldn't see in the helicopter.
I couldn't identify them.

52:35.568 --> 52:38.071
You couldn't identify them.

52:38.988 --> 52:42.533
Except... they're the guys.

52:42.617 --> 52:46.954
They work for Leo Watts.
There's nothing I can do.

52:47.038 --> 52:51.751
All I can charge him with is riding on a train.
They're gonna walk.

52:54.295 --> 52:57.006
There'll be a funeral for Benti.

52:57.507 --> 53:00.468
Flag-draped coffin,
everybody in dress blues...

53:00.551 --> 53:05.598
his picture up on the precinct wall,
people saying how terrible it was.

53:05.682 --> 53:08.976
Another funeral for the pilot,
not as spiffy as Benti's.

53:09.060 --> 53:11.229
No flags, nothing like that.

53:11.979 --> 53:14.691
There'll be two wives serving
a lot of food for people...

53:14.774 --> 53:17.944
two groups of children trying
to be very brave.

53:19.195 --> 53:23.074
Those two guys died trying to help
get you back to Los Angeles...

53:23.157 --> 53:27.495
and the two guys
who killed them are gonna walk...

53:28.454 --> 53:32.500
unless you testify against the man
who sent 'em up here.

53:39.006 --> 53:41.759
Two years from retirement.

53:47.056 --> 53:48.433
What a jerk.

54:06.951 --> 54:08.411
Keep the lights out.

54:22.091 --> 54:25.511
Jesus, they didn't exactly
bring out the national guard, did they?

54:27.513 --> 54:30.433
I guess they didn't wanna
attract too much attention.

54:30.516 --> 54:32.602
You stay here, okay?

54:34.228 --> 54:37.648
Don't do anything, but just stay out of sight.

54:37.732 --> 54:43.196
When we're ready, when I think it's secure,
I'll come and get you.

54:43.821 --> 54:46.741
- Oh, and, uh...
- I know, I know. Lock it.

55:06.511 --> 55:08.387
- You Caulfield?
- Yeah.

55:08.471 --> 55:12.850
I'm sergeant Nigro, RCMP.
Detective Loughlin.

55:14.644 --> 55:17.897
- They sent two of you, huh?
- Well, it's a pretty remote area.

55:17.980 --> 55:21.150
- Backup's on the way.
- So, you guys are Mounties?

55:21.234 --> 55:25.822
Yes, uh, we don't really use horses anymore.
That's mostly for the tourists.

55:25.905 --> 55:30.284
Besides, uh, horses don't have
air conditioning.

55:30.409 --> 55:36.040
Look, uh, I don't think we should stand
around out here any longer than is necessary.

55:36.123 --> 55:38.751
- Where's the woman?
- She's on the train.

55:38.835 --> 55:41.170
I've got her hidden.

55:41.254 --> 55:43.714
A couple guys on the train
have been following us, they're armed.

55:43.798 --> 55:46.509
Uh, I think I've got them
on a possible 314 though.

55:46.592 --> 55:49.136
I think we should get the woman
into safe custody.

55:49.220 --> 55:51.264
Your 314s can't get anywhere.

55:51.347 --> 55:55.601
We'll send some units down to meet the train
at the next stop. We'll nail 'em.

55:55.685 --> 55:57.311
I think you're right.

55:57.395 --> 56:00.857
Well, why don't you get the woman
and we can get out of here?

56:00.940 --> 56:02.400
Right.

56:03.901 --> 56:06.279
Listen, I know you're gonna think
this is real dumb of me...

56:06.362 --> 56:08.906
but, uh, I haven't been
feeling very good lately, and, uh...

56:08.990 --> 56:10.700
My stomach, you know.

56:10.783 --> 56:13.786
Uh, so I really got to run over
to the toilet just for a second.

56:13.870 --> 56:17.206
- Well, uh, what are you, are you serious?
- Yeah, hey, I don't have any choice.

56:17.290 --> 56:20.251
You know what it's like, uh...
I'll be right back.

57:38.162 --> 57:40.706
Mr. Caulfield?
You all right?

57:42.833 --> 57:44.502
Caulfield?

58:12.905 --> 58:16.826
Shithead. A 314 is indecent exposure.
You're no cop.

58:16.909 --> 58:19.036
- Who sent you?
- Fuck you.

58:43.185 --> 58:46.480
You're a dead man. Do you know that?

01:03:07.574 --> 01:03:11.912
- You all right?
- Yeah. That was close.

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:15.207
I was taking a walk.
I didn't realize the train was leaving.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:19.086
- You could have been hurt.
- Yeah, that was real stupid of me.

01:03:19.169 --> 01:03:22.214
- I'll never do that again.
- I certainly hope not.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.841
Listen...

01:03:25.926 --> 01:03:27.469
Never mind.

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:24.985
Mr. Caulfield. I have a business proposition
that might interest you.

01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:28.655
- Would you, gentlemen, care for a drink?
- Uh, what will you have? It's my treat.

01:04:28.739 --> 01:04:31.283
- Coffee, please.
- My friend will have a cup of coffee, please.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:34.745
Seven & Seven for me and scotch
on the rocks for my associate. Thank you.

01:04:34.828 --> 01:04:37.373
I figured him for something
with a little umbrella in it.

01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:40.167
If you're trying to get him to lose
his composure, you're not gonna succeed.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.878
He's very good at what he does. So am I.

01:04:42.961 --> 01:04:46.590
The difference between us is that
I do it for a living and he enjoys it.

01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:48.634
Well, I think that people should have fun at work.

01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:51.261
It makes the clay go by much quicker.

01:04:51.345 --> 01:04:54.848
As I said, I have
a business proposition for you.

01:04:56.725 --> 01:05:03.023
Tell me, how much does a deputy
district attorney make in a year?

01:05:03.107 --> 01:05:05.442
- Enough.
- Oh, I doubt that.

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:06.902
Are you thinking of becoming a lawyer?

01:05:06.985 --> 01:05:10.239
No, I was thinking that we might
perhaps negotiate an arrangement...

01:05:10.322 --> 01:05:12.991
that would be mutually satisfactory.

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:16.703
He says he thinks we can make a deal.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.960
- Does he speak?
- Yeah. Sometimes very convincingly.

01:05:23.043 --> 01:05:25.379
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:05:26.713 --> 01:05:29.800
- Thank you. Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:37.474
The people I work for are very determined.
They want the woman.

01:05:37.558 --> 01:05:42.813
You have her, and the question is simply:
How much do you want?

01:05:43.313 --> 01:05:45.190
What woman?

01:05:46.775 --> 01:05:49.027
Well, you know we're gonna find her.
It's just a matter of time.

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:52.990
What I'm proposing here
is that you recognize the inevitable.

01:05:53.782 --> 01:05:55.993
I don't know what woman you're talking about.

01:05:56.076 --> 01:05:59.872
First you lost your briefcase,
and now you've lost some woman.

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:02.291
You guys got to be more careful.

01:06:02.374 --> 01:06:07.087
The people I work for have
a large investment in this matter.

01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:09.715
And they are very determined.

01:06:09.798 --> 01:06:12.009
- They sound like interesting people.
- Very interesting.

01:06:12.092 --> 01:06:14.344
They give a good dental plan to you?

01:06:14.428 --> 01:06:20.309
What I'm talking about is probably
10 times what you earn in a year.

01:06:20.392 --> 01:06:22.519
Including whatever you steal on your expense account.

01:06:22.603 --> 01:06:25.022
- I don't steal.
- An honest man, I like that.

01:06:25.105 --> 01:06:27.566
- So do I.
- 10... times.

01:06:27.649 --> 01:06:30.694
You could never get that far ahead
if you worked for another 30 years.

01:06:30.777 --> 01:06:34.239
And then there is always a possibility
that you won't survive that long.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:35.407
That's true.

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:42.289
All you have to do is point her out
and look the other way.

01:06:42.372 --> 01:06:46.293
Now that's not a great deal of effort
for more money than you ever dreamed of.

01:06:46.376 --> 01:06:49.004
And no risk... no risk to you at all.

01:06:49.087 --> 01:06:51.632
You can go through
all the motions of guarding her...

01:06:51.715 --> 01:06:52.799
we'll take care of the rest.

01:06:52.883 --> 01:06:55.844
Now, this offer doesn't stay
on the table for too long.

01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:57.804
Obviously, we're going to find the woman.

01:06:57.888 --> 01:07:01.016
There are a couple of things you should know
before you make your decision.

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:04.686
Jack, show him what you have.

01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:11.985
- Do you know what this is?
- I have a feeling you're gonna tell me.

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:16.031
It seems that something has happened
to the communications gear on this train.

01:07:16.114 --> 01:07:20.327
There's no way for anyone to radio ahead.
That's a shame, isn't it?

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:22.120
The other item that might interest you...

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.122
is that when this train reaches its destination...

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:27.543
there gonna be some people
waiting for you. Quite a few of them.

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:29.419
They're not like us.

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:33.215
Now, we have no desire for needless violence.

01:07:33.298 --> 01:07:35.259
We're professionals, just like you.

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:37.386
To have an ugly incident occur
while we're on this train...

01:07:37.469 --> 01:07:40.639
with no method of escape,
that is not in our self-interest, either.

01:07:40.722 --> 01:07:45.227
However, the men that are waiting
for you, that is a different matter.

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:49.022
They're simply not gonna let you and that
woman get off this train and walk away.

01:07:49.106 --> 01:07:50.774
It's as simple as that.

01:07:50.857 --> 01:07:53.068
I've been doing some checking on you, Mr. Caulfield.

01:07:53.151 --> 01:07:54.695
You have an interesting resume.

01:07:54.778 --> 01:07:58.615
Top of your law school class.
A decorated marine.

01:07:58.699 --> 01:08:02.327
And you have a reputation
for being a very good prosecutor.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:06.164
You also have a reputation
for having something of a big mouth.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:10.627
It seems that you pissed off too many people.
You're never gonna be the district attorney.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:12.462
It's a shame, isn't it?

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:16.216
I suppose there's two reasons why someone
would remain a deputy district attorney.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.594
You're either rich or you're afraid
to go out on your own?

01:08:18.676 --> 01:08:21.470
There's a third reason, too.

01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:26.643
I don't like people like you,
and I really don't like people like your boss.

01:08:26.727 --> 01:08:29.688
I enjoy putting you away.
I really do.

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:32.441
If I wanted to make money, I'd have to defend you.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:35.986
And that wouldn't be any fun.
I'd always feel like I need to shower.

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:40.282
I enjoy sitting in a courtroom,
looking across as the judge passes sentence...

01:08:40.365 --> 01:08:43.993
as your shirt collar
starts to get a little too tight, like...

01:08:44.077 --> 01:08:46.662
I'm gonna love sitting there watching Leo Watts.

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.915
I like my side of the courtroom.

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:51.667
The pay is not so good,
but the air is a lot better.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:55.671
I am offering you enough money
that your whole life would be different.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:59.468
Don't tell me that you're above temptation.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:03.846
I'm very tempted at your offer, yes.
There's just one small problem.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:04.640
What's that?

01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:08.685
I don't know who this woman is
that you keep talking about.

01:09:09.394 --> 01:09:13.439
- I'm really gonna enjoy this.
- Give it a rest, will you?

01:09:13.523 --> 01:09:16.734
There are no more stops between here and Vancouver.

01:09:16.818 --> 01:09:19.988
You can't get off the train. Neither can the woman.

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:23.241
You don't have a lot of choice. Think about it.

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:25.035
I will.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.953
Do you really think
you can get her off this train?

01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:29.538
Get who?

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.337
Well...

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:38.298
Thank you for the coffee.

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:43.804
I've, uh, really enjoyed
this little chat. I really have.

01:09:43.886 --> 01:09:46.264
- I must go now.
- We'll talk again.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:49.350
Yeah, well... I'm in the book.

01:10:06.243 --> 01:10:07.869
It's me.

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.666
Jesus Christ, what happened?

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:18.338
Your friend Leo Watts,
he's got a buddy in the D.A.'s office.

01:10:18.422 --> 01:10:20.257
His name is Dahlbeck.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.676
Those two guys he sent here, they weren't cops.

01:10:22.759 --> 01:10:25.804
- I thought you were dead.
- Well, I'm not.

01:10:25.887 --> 01:10:28.306
You get this. When I get to I.A., Dahlbeck is mine.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.350
- If you get to I.A.
- We'll get there.

01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:32.102
- How?
- I'll take care of it.

01:10:32.185 --> 01:10:36.231
Are you telling me not to worry but free
the lab when you work everything out?

01:10:36.314 --> 01:10:40.736
This is my life we're dealing with!
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:43.488
<i>I thought you were dead.
I thought I was on my own.</i>

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:47.284
You come prancing in here with your
fancy I.D. and tell me not to worry?

01:10:47.367 --> 01:10:49.327
You're really a jerk!

01:10:51.788 --> 01:10:55.876
"My friend" Leo Watts...
Do you know what really happened?

01:10:55.959 --> 01:10:58.295
I mean, do you know anything about me?

01:10:58.378 --> 01:11:01.298
I know you're Michael Tarlow's girlfriend.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:07.554
Well, it must be really nice
not to let knowledge get in your way.

01:11:12.684 --> 01:11:16.938
I never met Michael Tarlow in my life before that night.

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:22.486
I was fixed up on a blind date
by a well-meaning friend.

01:11:24.404 --> 01:11:26.865
I saw a man get murdered.

01:11:26.948 --> 01:11:30.619
I don't know if he was a good man
or if he was a bad man.

01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:35.707
Then I saw someone take his life
as casually as you'd buy a stick of gum.

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:40.253
It's not like it is on television. It was horrible.

01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:42.464
It's not a part of my life.

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:47.469
It's something you read about,
except that it never happens to you.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.017
I don't know how I got home that night.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:59.648
The most difficult part was trying to
act normal when I paid off the babysitter.

01:12:00.607 --> 01:12:04.569
Yes. I have a son. He's 10 years old.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:08.448
But I thought you'd have known that,
since you know everything about me.

01:12:08.532 --> 01:12:11.993
I just went into his room that night
and watched him sleeping.

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:15.413
Thought maybe the sight of
that kind of innocence...

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:19.876
would make the world seem a little less horrible. It didn't.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.839
It was all over the 11 o'clock news who Michael Tarlow was.

01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:29.719
That he was a lawyer for this
famous gangster named Leo Watts.

01:12:29.803 --> 01:12:34.307
They had a photograph of Leo Watts on TV.
It was the man in the hotel room.

01:12:34.391 --> 01:12:37.227
All I could think of was to run.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.814
I took my son to his father's house.

01:12:40.897 --> 01:12:43.942
I told his father to go away right then.

01:12:44.484 --> 01:12:47.988
Not to tell anybody here he was going, not even me.

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:52.742
I knew I had to get as far away from my son as I could.

01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:55.287
I went to my brother's cabin.

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.873
It's so remote I thought I would be safe there.

01:12:57.956 --> 01:12:59.708
I figured no one could find me.

01:12:59.791 --> 01:13:03.837
So don't you ever judge me. Don't you dare.

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:07.757
I'm scared stiff.

01:13:10.635 --> 01:13:12.721
I don't wanna die.

01:13:16.057 --> 01:13:19.019
I'd gladly die
for my son, however.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:22.022
This is not just about me.

01:13:23.231 --> 01:13:28.320
I would like to do the right thing. I really would. I just...

01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:33.617
I'm just so scared. This is not just about me.

01:13:38.496 --> 01:13:42.918
So here's the program:
You're gonna tell me what is going on...

01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:46.171
and you're gonna tell me what ideas
you have, if you have any.

01:13:46.254 --> 01:13:48.131
I need to know.

01:13:51.468 --> 01:13:53.511
I'm sorry.

01:13:54.846 --> 01:13:57.432
They still don't know where you are.

01:13:58.141 --> 01:14:01.311
I don't think they'll make a move tonight
because they don't have to.

01:14:01.394 --> 01:14:05.732
We have to do something before this train
makes the last stop, though.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.902
We can't get off the train.

01:14:09.736 --> 01:14:12.614
There isn't anybody
I can call for help.

01:14:14.366 --> 01:14:19.079
They've got somebody else on the train besides the two guys.

01:14:19.162 --> 01:14:22.582
I think I know who it is. It's a big, fat guy.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:28.922
I, uh... I don't know exactly
what I'm going to do.

01:14:30.507 --> 01:14:35.887
I just know that I have to make my move before they make theirs.

01:14:37.722 --> 01:14:40.934
Why don't you try to get some sleep now? You're gonna need it.

01:14:42.352 --> 01:14:46.690
- I can't sleep.
- Don't worry. I'll be up.

01:14:53.196 --> 01:14:55.699
You should wash that.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.118
Thank you.

01:15:33.987 --> 01:15:37.282
It's okay. Nothing's happened.

01:15:37.365 --> 01:15:39.325
- Okay?
- We're not dead yet?

01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:42.620
No... We're not dead yet.

01:15:43.246 --> 01:15:45.331
Well, that's good.

01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:47.709
I'm gonna leave you alone for a little while.

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:50.879
- Where are you going?
- To the dining car.

01:15:50.962 --> 01:15:55.592
If I'm there, they can't get by me
without my seeing them first.

01:15:55.675 --> 01:15:59.345
If they come after me,
at least you won't be right next to me.

01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:12.275
You'll be all right. Would you like some coffee?

01:16:13.693 --> 01:16:15.653
That would be nice.

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.633
Freeze, mister.

01:16:36.716 --> 01:16:39.928
- You're not robbing this train.
- Jesus Christ...

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:43.181
- That thing's not for real, is it?
- Course not. I'm a kid.

01:16:43.264 --> 01:16:44.974
You shouldn't go around pointing that thing on people.

01:16:45.058 --> 01:16:47.894
- You know, you could get hurt.
- You shouldn't go around robbing people.

01:16:47.977 --> 01:16:50.105
- You could go to jail.
- Well, I'm not a robber.

01:16:50.188 --> 01:16:53.775
- I don't believe you.
- Now, uh... Listen.

01:16:53.858 --> 01:16:57.654
- I got to go.
- I didn't say you could move.

01:16:57.737 --> 01:17:00.990
- Well, I got to go.
- I'll be watching you.

01:17:01.074 --> 01:17:03.535
- What's your name?
- Nick.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:07.997
- Do you always pretend you're a cop?
- Sometimes I'm the bad guy.

01:17:08.081 --> 01:17:12.293
Yeah, I understand. Pays better, right?
But right now you're a cop.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:17.090
<i>- Can you keep a secret?
- Course 1 can.</i>

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:29.853
Suppose I told you I was really a cop.

01:17:29.936 --> 01:17:33.398
- No way.
- Suppose I could prove it to you.

01:17:33.481 --> 01:17:35.900
Suppose I asked you for your help.

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:40.405
Would you give it to me, without telling anybody,
not saying anything to anyone?

01:17:40.488 --> 01:17:42.198
Prove it.

01:17:46.494 --> 01:17:48.288
- Is that real?
- Yes, it is.

01:17:48.371 --> 01:17:50.123
- No shit!
- No shit.

01:17:50.206 --> 01:17:52.709
This doesn't say you're a real cop. I can read, you know.

01:17:52.792 --> 01:17:55.795
- Well, it says I'm a deputy, doesn't it?
- Are you on a case?

01:17:55.879 --> 01:17:59.340
- Yeah, big one.
- Where's your gun?

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:00.675
Well, I don't have it.

01:18:00.758 --> 01:18:02.802
If you're a real cop, how come you don't have a gun?

01:18:02.886 --> 01:18:05.930
Well, that's the problem.
The bad guys took it.

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:08.892
- Are you kidding me?
- I wish I was.

01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:10.894
- I need your help.
- You do?

01:18:10.977 --> 01:18:13.646
- I need to borrow your gun.
- But it's not real.

01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:16.357
Well, we won't tell anybody about that, okay?

01:18:16.441 --> 01:18:18.610
Raise your right hand.

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:22.238
Put your left hand on the gun.
I'm gonna deputize you.

01:18:22.322 --> 01:18:24.407
According to the laws of the state of California...

01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:26.910
and the international laws of criminal justice...

01:18:26.993 --> 01:18:30.413
I hereby deputize you as special assistant.

01:18:30.496 --> 01:18:33.374
Subject to all the laws of, uh...

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:36.002
of secrecy and jurisprudence, so help me God.

01:18:36.085 --> 01:18:37.962
- Say "I do"
- I do.

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:40.798
- What's it mean?
- It means, um...

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:44.010
if you say anything about this,
your ass is grass.

01:18:44.093 --> 01:18:46.221
- Okay.
- Okay, deputy-

01:18:46.304 --> 01:18:48.598
Go see your mother now. Just act normal.

01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:49.933
Yes, sir.

01:18:57.857 --> 01:19:00.151
Good morning, sir, would you like some breakfast?

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:02.612
Uh, no, thanks.
Just some, uh, coffee, please. Black.

01:19:02.695 --> 01:19:06.157
- And a, uh cup of coffee to go.
- Certainly, sir.

01:19:09.535 --> 01:19:11.704
Well... Good morning.

01:19:11.788 --> 01:19:13.748
- Good morning.
- Do you mind if I join you?

01:19:13.831 --> 01:19:17.585
Well, uh, actually I'm just having coffee.
I'm not having breakfast or anything.

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:21.839
- Oh, of course. Please. Sit down.
- Thank you.

01:19:28.179 --> 01:19:30.223
- Did you sleep well?
- Not much. No.

01:19:30.306 --> 01:19:31.766
Me, too.

01:19:31.849 --> 01:19:35.061
Didn't think it could be so difficult to sleep on a train.

01:19:35.144 --> 01:19:38.147
- God! It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, yes.

01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:40.608
Good morning, ma'am.
Would you care for some breakfast?

01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:43.778
Um, just some tea, please. And some toast.

01:19:43.861 --> 01:19:47.031
- Uh, what kind of bread?
- Any kind. Wheat?

01:19:50.159 --> 01:19:52.453
You, um, getting coffee for someone?

01:19:52.537 --> 01:19:57.041
Uh, no. I just thought I'd have a cup here
and take a cup back to the compartment.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.168
I have a lot of reading to do before we get in.

01:19:59.252 --> 01:20:02.588
- Just records and stuff like that.
- What kind of work do you do?

01:20:02.672 --> 01:20:05.091
Sales.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.219
What do you sell?

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:12.015
Construction, um... supplies. Heavy equipment...

01:20:12.098 --> 01:20:13.683
Oh, I see.

01:20:15.685 --> 01:20:18.896
- You don't look like the salesman type.
- Oh, what type is that?

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.941
Well, somebody who looks comfortable with a name tag on their pocket.

01:20:22.025 --> 01:20:25.069
- You know, "Hello, my name is..."
- Yes, but I don't have to do that.

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:27.238
- Oh, good.
- Your toast will be ready in a moment.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:28.906
Thanks.

01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:34.912
- Where are you from?
- Uh, Los Angeles.

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:37.081
Oh! I go there quite often.

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:40.710
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna be there next week.

01:20:40.793 --> 01:20:45.757
- I stay at the, um, the Bel Air.
- That's a very nice place.

01:20:48.051 --> 01:20:50.345
Would you like to see me?

01:20:50.428 --> 01:20:52.847
- What did you say? I'm sorry.
- Nothing. It's not important.

01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:57.643
- No, it was. What did you say?
- I feel like an idiot. I...

01:20:57.727 --> 01:20:59.854
I just asked if you'd like
to see me again.

01:20:59.937 --> 01:21:01.898
- Oh, of course! Yes.
- How's she doing?

01:21:01.981 --> 01:21:04.609
- What?
- Your wife. How is she doin'?

01:21:04.692 --> 01:21:07.528
I gave him my compartment. He only had coach seats.

01:21:07.612 --> 01:21:11.574
His wife looked like she was gonna have
the baby right there in the train station.

01:21:11.657 --> 01:21:15.161
She's doing fine, thank you. Thank you very much. That's very kind of you.

01:21:15.244 --> 01:21:17.747
I hope that you and your wife
were not uncomfortable.

01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:20.333
Hell, no! We played cards all night.

01:21:20.416 --> 01:21:22.877
I cheat. So does she. But I cheat better.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.004
That's why
she's buying breakfast.

01:21:26.589 --> 01:21:30.176
Well, I got to be going. Hope everything turns out right.

01:21:30.259 --> 01:21:32.428
Thank you. Thank you. You don't understand.

01:21:32.512 --> 01:21:33.971
- I do understand.
- Please...

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:36.224
This is ridiculous. You do not have to apologize.

01:21:36.307 --> 01:21:39.852
No, please. I just... I can't explain. Please.

01:21:44.023 --> 01:21:46.192
- Come with me.
- What?

01:21:46.275 --> 01:21:48.277
- Come with me now. Don't ask questions.
- I don't want to. Wait a second!

01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:52.240
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
You're in danger.

01:21:52.323 --> 01:21:53.825
What's going on here?

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.660
What is it?

01:21:59.664 --> 01:22:01.749
Where are you taking me?
Who are you?

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:04.293
There are two guys on this train.
They think you're someone else.

01:22:04.377 --> 01:22:05.753
Will you let go of me!

01:22:05.837 --> 01:22:08.381
You get in your compartment, shut the door and lock it.

01:22:08.464 --> 01:22:10.758
My compartment is
back the other way!

01:22:10.842 --> 01:22:14.762
- You can't go back the other way.
- Would you please tell me what's going on?

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:17.014
I don't have time.

01:22:19.725 --> 01:22:20.893
What seems to be the problem here?

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:22.145
- This man...
- No problem at all.

01:22:22.228 --> 01:22:25.189
- Looks like there's one to me.
- I don't give a shit what it looks like to you.

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:28.526
That's no way to talk.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to come with me.

01:22:28.609 --> 01:22:30.528
The name's Keller. Railroad security.

01:22:30.611 --> 01:22:33.448
- Step away from the lady and come with me.
- You're a railroad cop?

01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:36.617
There are two men on this train.
They're tryin' to kill someone.

01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:38.661
The person they're after
is a woman.

01:22:38.744 --> 01:22:40.788
I think I know who the two are. I've been watching them.

01:22:40.872 --> 01:22:42.790
I've been watching you too. Where is she?

01:22:42.874 --> 01:22:46.043
She's safe right now. I believe they think she's the woman.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.004
- What do you want me to do?
- Where's your compartment?

01:22:48.087 --> 01:22:50.631
- One car behind us.
- Let's go there.

01:22:56.345 --> 01:22:58.681
Keep her in there. They'll never think to look for her in there.

01:22:58.764 --> 01:23:00.975
I got a radio inside.
I can call ahead for help.

01:23:01.058 --> 01:23:03.519
- I thought communications were out.
- Mine's a portable unit.

01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:06.939
Have your people contact the Los Angeles district attorney's office.

01:23:07.023 --> 01:23:10.401
Tell them to ask for chief deputy district attorney Martin Larner.

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.904
But not to talk to anybody else. That's very important.

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:16.741
I want them to tell Larner
that Dahlbeck is dirty.

01:23:16.824 --> 01:23:19.160
- Do it right away.
- Listen.

01:23:19.243 --> 01:23:21.704
Not just your grocer who loves you.

01:23:24.916 --> 01:23:26.792
It's Caulfield.

01:23:27.585 --> 01:23:32.798
- What took you so long?
- We're gonna change compartments, okay?

01:23:36.552 --> 01:23:39.639
- What happened?
- Things are looking up.

01:23:39.722 --> 01:23:42.934
There's a railroad cop on the train.
I'm gonna put you in his compartment.

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:46.020
If nothing else, it'll give us a little time.

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.654
Jesus Christ!

01:23:57.323 --> 01:24:00.159
- They took her.
- Who?

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:03.955
There was a woman in here.
They thought she was you.

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:05.665
Oh, clear God.

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:20.054
Get out of the way!

01:24:30.147 --> 01:24:31.190
Wait. Wait!

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:48.749
- Grab the hand rail! Get on the roof!
- I can't!

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:52.545
You don't have any choice.
Just don't think about it! Just do it!

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:02.221
When you get on the roof, lie flat!

01:25:04.515 --> 01:25:06.309
You're doing fine!

01:25:56.233 --> 01:25:58.069
End of the line, asshole!

01:25:59.445 --> 01:26:04.492
Wiggle your ear. Wiggle your toes. Come on. I wanna do you.

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.455
Toy gun.

01:26:57.294 --> 01:27:00.965
- Let's go!
- I can't move! I'm afraid!

01:27:01.048 --> 01:27:03.843
- Yeah, so am I. Let's go. Come on. Come on!
- I can't.

01:31:20.849 --> 01:31:23.352
I don't want you.
Just her.

01:31:24.895 --> 01:31:28.190
You understand. It's strictly business.

01:31:29.858 --> 01:31:32.444
You should have taken the money.

01:31:35.322 --> 01:31:38.158
You know what I like about you?

01:31:38.242 --> 01:31:40.202
You're tall.

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.266
<i>- Larner.</i>
- This is Caulfield.

01:32:02.349 --> 01:32:05.185
- <i> Where the hell have you been ?</i>
- I don't have time to explain.

01:32:05.269 --> 01:32:08.564
Just listen to me.
Our friend Dahlbeck works for Leo Watts.

01:32:08.647 --> 01:32:10.524
- We wound up on a train.
- <i> A train ?</i>

01:32:10.607 --> 01:32:13.569
Listen to me. The train is stopped on a side.
I'm calling you from a farmhouse.

01:32:13.652 --> 01:32:16.488
I'm about 100 miles from Vancouver.
The woman is safe.

01:32:16.572 --> 01:32:19.867
I've contacted the Canadian authorities.
They'll be here any minute.

01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:23.829
- Get in touch with them. Meet us at the border.
- I'm on <i>my way.</i>

01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:31.754
And the man told Mr. Tarlow
not to be afraid.

01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:33.380
I remember he said:

01:32:33.464 --> 01:32:37.051
"Michael, you're acting as though you think I'll harm you."

01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:42.848
And then he told Mr. Tarlow that he was to go back to New York.

01:32:42.931 --> 01:32:46.393
And he was to pay back all the money that he owed.

01:32:46.477 --> 01:32:48.812
Then he started to walk toward the door...

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:54.735
and he stopped and turned around and said: "Michael, I lied".

01:32:54.818 --> 01:32:58.906
And the other man that was with him
turned around...

01:32:58.989 --> 01:33:02.743
and pulled out a gun
and shot Mr. Tarlow.

01:33:02.826 --> 01:33:07.039
Did Mr. Tarlow call anybody in the room by name?

01:33:07.122 --> 01:33:09.583
Yes, he called the man Leo.

01:33:09.666 --> 01:33:12.252
And did you get a clear look at the man named Leo?

01:33:12.336 --> 01:33:14.338
- Yes.
- Could you identify him?

01:33:14.421 --> 01:33:16.757
- Yes.
- Is he in the courtroom at this time?

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.967
- Yes.
- Could you point to him?

01:33:19.051 --> 01:33:20.511
Yes.

01:33:22.221 --> 01:33:25.015
It's that man sitting right there.

01:33:30.646 --> 01:33:35.609
Let the record state that the witness has pointed to Mr. Leo Watts.

01:33:35.692 --> 01:33:38.987
Thank you, Miss Hunnicut. No further questions.
