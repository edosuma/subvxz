WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:08.747
Previously on "SEAL Team"…
A few weeks ago,

00:08.791 --> 00:12.838
Mr. Quinn assaulted a patron
at a Washington, D.C. pub,

00:12.882 --> 00:14.449
and this is how I'm handling it.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.581
Petty Officer Quinn will travel
to Laughlin Air Force base

00:16.625 --> 00:19.149
tomorrow for six weeks of
advanced armory school.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.064
How in the hell
did Lindell

00:21.108 --> 00:22.761
find out what happened in D.C.?

00:22.805 --> 00:24.241
You happen to tell him at
one of your private meetings?

00:24.285 --> 00:26.591
Why would I do that?
Well, the teacher's pet

00:26.635 --> 00:28.071
does need his star, doesn't he?

00:28.115 --> 00:29.986
He's pushing me for STA-21.I knew it!

00:30.030 --> 00:32.597
I haven't said yes.
Well, no, you haven't
said no, either, have you?

00:32.641 --> 00:34.034
I really thought that I could

00:34.077 --> 00:36.427
be all in with Bravo
and with you.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.038
And I was wrong.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.344
Bravo Team needs me more
than you do right now.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.216
You're definitely coming back?

00:42.259 --> 00:43.869
Promise you won't
die over there?

00:43.913 --> 00:45.088
I promise.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.089
Teena says she'll go with you.

00:46.133 --> 00:49.092

02:59.962 --> 03:02.225
Does this look like the same
one I snapped yesterday?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.575
It's the same picture, Ray.
Documenting Teena's
time in Afghanistan

03:04.619 --> 03:06.490
is a great way to stay
in touch with...Take the doll...

03:06.534 --> 03:09.232
Put the doll away.
No, it's a great way to stay close

03:09.276 --> 03:10.538
with Jameelah.
Let her know…
Put it away.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.192
Daddy's safe.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.541
I can take one for you for Natalie if you want.
No, that's okay.

03:13.584 --> 03:17.109
Yeah-- What is up
with this place, huh?

03:17.153 --> 03:18.459
I mean, look at it, it's like...

03:18.502 --> 03:20.548
Seems like everybody's clocking out.

03:20.591 --> 03:22.071
Well, that's 'cause
they are, brother.

03:22.114 --> 03:25.248
I mean, it's a base closure
and a troop drawdown.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.684
Everybody's trying
to give peace a chance.

03:26.728 --> 03:27.990
Yeah, well, it's Afghanistan.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.209
Danger lurking around every corner.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.862
You know that.
Yeah. Well, you can wait

03:30.906 --> 03:32.821
on that danger to come along, but me?

03:32.864 --> 03:35.606
Since I told my daughter
I was gonna make it home,

03:35.650 --> 03:38.392
I'm not complaining about
how quiet things are.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.220
Jason Hayes.

03:40.263 --> 03:41.612
Ray Perry.
Wow.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.179
I heard a rumor Bravo was back.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.660
Jack Daniels, my man--
look at him. Wait a second.

03:45.703 --> 03:48.140
Got the same watch on
I gave him last time, huh?

03:48.184 --> 03:50.273
Good as new.
Man, haven't seen you
in a few deployments.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.101
Yeah, I know.
Not since he gave me this watch.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.363
And it's still running,
isn't it?

03:53.407 --> 03:55.191
Not sure I can say the same for us.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.062
Yeah, man, you know you
rode shotgun with us

03:57.106 --> 03:59.108
on some of our
hairiest ops, brother.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.152
My wife and children are glad

04:00.196 --> 04:01.458
they're behind me.
So, what's up?

04:01.502 --> 04:03.025
You still, uh,
interpreting for SOCOM?

04:03.068 --> 04:05.941
No, I am working with the
Ministry of Interior now.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.683
Hopefully bringing
some stability to my country.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.206
So you're the reason
my team is so bored.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.990
If I do my job right, Jason,

04:12.034 --> 04:13.470
you'll be bored for months.

04:13.514 --> 04:16.125
Been three weeks
since we arrived.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.170
Bravo's getting antsy.
With the drawdown,

04:18.214 --> 04:19.302
there's not a lot
of kinetic action out there

04:19.346 --> 04:20.911
for Tier One operators.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.958
What about targeting packages
from past teams?

04:23.001 --> 04:25.482
I need more intel, but
I'm hitting roadblocks.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.745
All the other agencies
seem focused

04:27.789 --> 04:29.834
on the upcoming
key leader engagement.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.140
Peace with the Taliban.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.141
Never thought I'd see the day.

04:32.184 --> 04:33.534
You know, something tells me

04:33.577 --> 04:36.145
you both think
that's a bad idea.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.234
This country hasn't
seen peace in ages,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.845
so our departure's gonna
cause some growing pains.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.369
Violent ones.
Jeopardizing all
the progress we've made

04:42.412 --> 04:44.066
in the past two decades.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.720
Yeah, you're probably right,
but nobody around here

04:45.763 --> 04:49.680
wants to hear that, so I
suggest you not make any waves.

04:51.465 --> 04:54.032
Picked up these secrets
from a Snake Eater in Kunduz.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.121
Hand-roasted beans. Burr grind.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.559
I must've schwacked two dozen
bad guys on that pump.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.996
Every story includes a body count.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.650
Eh, Thirty Mike
just saying words.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.391
Words with dollar signs
attached to them.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.218
Some publisher's gonna
make it rain for my memoir

05:06.262 --> 05:08.133
of all the ninja ops
I rolled on.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.048
And we'll find it
in the fiction section.

05:12.050 --> 05:15.402
Nice job, T.
All right. Settle in, boys.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.055
Papa needs to make
this shot right here.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.231
50 bucks you miss.
All right.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.321
Finally get
a little action around here.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.412
Oh!

05:25.455 --> 05:26.456
Yes!

05:26.500 --> 05:28.023
That tab's getting
up there, buddy.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.286
Someone, uh, want
to explain this to me?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.333
Huh?
Well, since a, uh, "volunteer"

05:33.376 --> 05:35.117
has to go babysit
those little Army boots

05:35.160 --> 05:36.858
in that COP Redding
bullet sponge,

05:36.901 --> 05:38.163
we have decided that the loser

05:38.207 --> 05:39.556
of the Camp Larkin Openhas to go.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.253
It's not so bad out there.

05:41.297 --> 05:45.083
I had a forbidden thing with
a local smoke show years ago.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.999
No, you didn't.
I vote that we find someone else

05:48.043 --> 05:49.914
from Charlie Team
to fill in for Sonny.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.134
Yeah, uh, Thirty Mike
is an acquired taste.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.744
Speaking of, has anybody
heard from Sonny?

05:53.788 --> 05:54.919
Did they hit 'em up?

05:54.963 --> 05:57.182
No. Radio silent.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.967
Honestly, it's probably better
that he's not here, though.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.055
He'd be climbing
the frickin' walls

06:00.098 --> 06:02.013
with us just sitting
around like this.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.580
You can't complain
about the op tempo, man.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.974
It's nice not being shot at
for a little while.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.454
You know, the Ray Perry I met
a dozen years ago

06:07.497 --> 06:09.281
would kick your ass
for saying that.

06:09.325 --> 06:10.370
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.414
So what, we're just
gonna play golf

06:11.458 --> 06:13.068
and work on our tansall deployment?

06:13.111 --> 06:15.070
My guess is we're sidelined

06:15.113 --> 06:17.420
as a way to show the Taliban our
commitment towards drawdown.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.987
Bunch of Tier One operators
start making hits,

06:19.030 --> 06:20.292
and they got to worry
we have an agenda.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.251
Wow, pretty and smart.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.774
You know, you should
think about joining

06:23.818 --> 06:25.472
the real pipe hitters
on Charlie Team.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.647
Clay's not going nowhere.

06:26.690 --> 06:27.778
Except COP Redding.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.258
Oh...

06:29.301 --> 06:32.087
Sorry, Trent. Only thing worse
than doing nothing here

06:32.130 --> 06:34.089
is doing nothing alone.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.812
What's your poison?

07:01.856 --> 07:04.989
I'll get a-a whiskey, neat.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.820
Thank you, Miss Hannah.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.302
Sonny Quinn.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.173
In the flesh.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.480
I like the beard.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.482
It's a definite upgrade
from that sad little caterpillar

07:19.526 --> 07:21.179
above your lip in eighth grade.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.617
Oh, yeah? Well, greatness
comes from humble beginnings.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.141
So, you work here now?

07:26.184 --> 07:27.447
I own here now.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.797
Saved up and bought the
place a few years back.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.147
From humble beginnings.
Ah.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.628
Well, huh.

07:34.671 --> 07:35.977
You've been busy, huh?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.848
You've been M.I.A.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.634
Yeah.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.984
So of all the gin joints in all
the towns in all the world,

07:43.027 --> 07:44.376
what brings you into mine
this afternoon?

07:44.420 --> 07:47.162
Well, uh, you know,

07:47.205 --> 07:51.079
I'm gonna be working over
in Laughlin for a while, so...

07:51.122 --> 07:52.602
I was remembering, you know,

07:52.646 --> 07:55.562
just all the hell-raising that
we used to do in this place.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.433
Oh, man, oh, man.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.869
So I figured I'd
just come on by

07:58.913 --> 08:00.567
and see if it
was still standing.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.307
Telling me you drove
all this way to see

08:02.351 --> 08:04.266
if this place
still smells like stale beer?

08:04.309 --> 08:05.223
Yes, ma'am.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.573
Come on, Sonny.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.400
After all these years,
I can still tell

08:08.444 --> 08:09.663
when you're hiding something.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.665
Is that right?

08:11.708 --> 08:13.536
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.365
What the hell's Team America
doing now?

08:16.408 --> 08:18.672
It looks like he's trying
to put the bar back together.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.935
Whole base is coming down,
he's building it back up.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.763
Dude is in denial.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.678
Mm-hmm. It's got to be
easier than the truth.

08:24.721 --> 08:25.940
You know, coming here
for the ninth time,

08:25.983 --> 08:27.158
witnessing a drawdown

08:27.202 --> 08:29.683
and watching us making
peace with the enemy.

08:29.726 --> 08:30.945
Clay.

08:30.988 --> 08:34.339
Let's help the man. Come on.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.648
What you doing, Bob Vila?

08:38.692 --> 08:40.302
Well, I figured, uh--

08:40.345 --> 08:42.433
Get the end of that and
push it together, all right?

08:42.477 --> 08:44.567
I figure we're gonna be at, uh,
Camp Larkin for a while,

08:44.611 --> 08:46.569
so let's turn it
back into our home.

08:46.613 --> 08:50.181
Get the bar up. Come on.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.009
Ready?
Yeah.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.890
All the fallen SEALs
who lived at Larkin.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.196
All these boys made
the ultimate sacrifice.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.372
It is on us right now,
it's on us

09:07.416 --> 09:10.593
to make sure that, uh,
no one else is added to this.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.813
J.Yeah?

09:14.249 --> 09:15.598
Eddie Guzman.
Yeah.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.428
Your old team leader?
Yeah.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.519
Wonder what he would
say if he knew

09:23.563 --> 09:24.999
we were making friends with Tali.

09:25.042 --> 09:28.132
He wouldn't say
a damn thing.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.439
He'd just spit out some chew
and keep working.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.049
Anyone who says otherwise
is a damn liar.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.834
No, he'd say he went down
fighting for the rest of us.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.313
That's what he would say.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.228
You know what? You
can save that crap

09:37.272 --> 09:39.230
for the Bravo kids you've
been spoon-feeding it to

09:39.274 --> 09:40.492
for the last ten years.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.103
I knew you before you were you.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.844
You just reminded me

09:43.887 --> 09:47.630
why Bravo Team kicked you down
to Charlie Team decades ago.

09:47.674 --> 09:48.849
You know what's funny?
What?

09:48.892 --> 09:50.241
How I'm back because Bravo 1

09:50.285 --> 09:51.939
couldn't keep his team together.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.245
Still have problems with the
truth, don't you, Thirty Mike?

09:54.289 --> 09:56.378
It's okay.
You'll grow up someday.
The truth.

09:56.421 --> 09:58.162
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Truth.
Yeah, like, with what happened to CuJo?

09:58.206 --> 09:59.511
Whoa, man.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.948
Hey.
Yo, man.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.558
Seriously?

10:03.864 --> 10:05.300
What's wrong
with you, man?

10:05.343 --> 10:06.954
Mortar?

10:11.523 --> 10:13.961
Told you, Ray.
Still Afghanistan.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.228
Now that's some tale.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.143
This Lindell fellow sounds
like a real villain.

10:22.186 --> 10:24.928
Well, I must've told it right,
then, because he is.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.669
The part where your teammates
turn on you?

10:26.713 --> 10:29.063
Betrayed by your brothers?
Damn near Shakespearean.

10:29.106 --> 10:33.067
Mm-hmm. Does that, uh, that make
me the tragic hero?

10:33.110 --> 10:35.460
Well, that's
up to you.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.768
Plan on going home
while you're here?

10:38.812 --> 10:41.684
I, uh, I popped by
a few weeks ago.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.600
Really? How'd that go?
Yeah.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.080
It was brief.

10:46.123 --> 10:50.519
Yeah, it appears that Emmet
didn't learn, uh,

10:50.562 --> 10:53.043
how to be a father while I was away.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.263
There's a lot of history
between you two.

10:55.306 --> 10:57.134
Yeah, and none of it pretty.

10:57.178 --> 11:01.182
I always thought he was the
strongest man in the world.

11:01.225 --> 11:04.925
You know, h-his voice would
send a shiver up my spine,

11:04.968 --> 11:07.797
and he could corral
a-a team of wild horses.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.800
Lot of time has passed.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.584
Might be worth
giving him a chance.

11:12.628 --> 11:15.283
Oh, no, no. Listen, I will pay
for my own liquor here

11:15.326 --> 11:17.807
if I don't have to listen
to you plead a case for...

11:17.851 --> 11:19.069
I'm not pleading anything.
I'm a neutral third party

11:19.113 --> 11:20.723
just looking to make peace.
All right.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.944
Okay.
He comes in here
every now and then.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.859
He's always alone.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.125
You know,
I only got two regrets.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.083
The first

11:33.127 --> 11:34.519
was leaving my Trans Am behind.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.652
Okay? You remember, like, all-all that-that time

11:36.696 --> 11:39.046
and hard work and money I would
put into it after school?

11:39.089 --> 11:41.657
You know?
Man, I-I-I can't even imagine

11:41.701 --> 11:46.575
what lowball offer
he let it go for.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.056
And what's the second?

11:49.099 --> 11:50.405
Um...

11:52.886 --> 11:56.019
The way I ghosted
when I enlisted.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.413
Well...

11:58.456 --> 12:02.460
You deserved better, all right?

12:02.504 --> 12:04.767
Should've never done that
to a best friend.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.815
Maybe Emmet deserved
better, too.

12:08.858 --> 12:11.208
You know,
rumor has it,

12:11.252 --> 12:12.949
your car's still
on that ranch.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.169
Yeah, it's probably more
run-down than-than he is.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.693
There's only one way
to find out for sure.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.695
I'll go along with you
if you get up the nerve.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.396
No. No.

12:37.234 --> 12:40.150
That's pathetic.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.589
I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to...

12:44.633 --> 12:46.504
No, no, no, no. No,
no. You know what?

12:46.548 --> 12:48.289
I'm just gonna check
and make sure...

12:48.332 --> 12:51.379
Yep, no, I'm-I'm the worst shot
on this entire base.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.294
But apparently you're a deadeye.
Well, helps me

12:53.337 --> 12:55.165
blow off steam when I've
had a frustrating day.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.472
You're an officer. Just, uh, make somebody
else do your work.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.778
Not really my style.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.301
Besides...

13:00.344 --> 13:02.520
Oh, you're-you're a J.O.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.348
So you got
something to prove.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.220
Listen, I'm not sure whether
you've seen the memo or not,

13:06.263 --> 13:08.004
but there's not really a lot
going on in J-Bad these days.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.701
So just do what
you're supposed to

13:09.745 --> 13:11.616
and you could be sleeping
instead of out here shooting.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.444
You know, with everybody
so focused on the drawdown,

13:13.488 --> 13:15.838
somebody's got to keep their
eyes open to the bigger picture.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.188
Not all of us want to just
hold up our contracts.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.887
Oh.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.890
I have been accused of being
many things before,

13:23.933 --> 13:26.196
but a contractor
is not one of them.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.197
Then what are you?

13:27.241 --> 13:28.808
Offended.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.722
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

13:30.766 --> 13:33.856
I'm gonna go back to giving this
target its stay of execution.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.076
Good night.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.121
Good night.

13:50.090 --> 13:50.917
Sorry about that.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.313
I'm very sorry.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.401
Oh, it's okay. He's fine.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.403
No, he's quite bad, actually.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.493
I can keep young men like him
from running off to war,

14:02.537 --> 14:04.844
but it seems I cannot
teach them to serve customers.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.323
Well, you're doing a good thing,

14:06.367 --> 14:07.585
giving him something to do.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.544
Yeah, good for our city.
Bad for my business.

14:09.587 --> 14:12.634
Hey, hey, whoa.
I hoped you saved some for us.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.462
That's all I got to say, huh?

14:14.505 --> 14:16.333
You all got a
front-row seat

14:16.377 --> 14:18.118
to the mortar fireworks
yesterday.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.728
Yeah, you got any idea
who was taking potshots at us?

14:19.771 --> 14:22.209
No. We've got a lot of enemies

14:22.252 --> 14:23.775
in the two decades we've been here.

14:23.819 --> 14:24.907
There's a lot
of threats out there.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.169
Nobody's paying it much mind.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.997
Brass has to validate the drawdown.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.434
Right. The brass has to
validate the drawdown.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.262
God forbid
a little war

14:32.306 --> 14:34.612
gets in the way
of the peace process.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.486
Please tell me that's an op.
No.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.444
There was a-a letter
published in the Post,

14:40.488 --> 14:42.142
says how
Ambassador Marsden

14:42.185 --> 14:43.883
wasn't at fault and died a hero.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.319
What about all that BS about her

14:45.362 --> 14:46.494
running guns and starting
a tribal war?

14:46.537 --> 14:48.148
Explained how it
couldn't be true.

14:48.191 --> 14:51.151
D.C.'s eating crow saying they
were working off bad intel.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.545
That's-that's great.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.069
I mean, she deserved
to be cleared.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.288
Yeah, it was messed up,
what they tried to do to her.

14:58.332 --> 14:59.724
They said who wrote the letter?

14:59.768 --> 15:01.248
It was anonymous,
sent to her husband,

15:01.291 --> 15:02.989
who then send it to the Post.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.513
But clearly whoever it is
had details about Yemen.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.689
Well, at least
it's put to bed for now.

15:07.732 --> 15:10.866
The false narrative might be put
to bed, but whoever took out

15:10.910 --> 15:12.868
the bogus hit job on Marsden,

15:12.912 --> 15:14.304
they're not gonna be happy.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.265
Look who it is.
Yo.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.006
Davis found something for us.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.573
What do you got?

15:22.617 --> 15:25.011
So, going over the remaining
target packages,

15:25.054 --> 15:26.447
and Charlie Team
was trying to locate

15:26.490 --> 15:27.970
a weapons cache
but never found it.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.580
I did.
Looking for weapons--

15:29.624 --> 15:31.147
isn't that more of a gig
for regular Army?

15:31.191 --> 15:32.844
Well, at least we're going
outside the wire.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.846
I mean, it's not the sexiest op,

15:34.890 --> 15:36.370
but it's something.
The cache is believed

15:36.413 --> 15:37.980
to be a spot
where the Haqqani network

15:38.024 --> 15:39.721
has dumped off a bunch
of their weapons.

15:39.764 --> 15:40.983
I'm not trying to dampen the mood,

15:41.027 --> 15:42.289
but correct me if I'm wrong--

15:42.332 --> 15:43.943
didn't we shut down
the Haqqani network,

15:43.986 --> 15:45.727
like, a couple years ago?
Look, I didn't say

15:45.770 --> 15:46.989
this was the hottest
target on the board.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.469
But we never found
where the network

15:48.512 --> 15:49.949
was hiding their weapons,

15:49.992 --> 15:51.428
so this could be
a treasure trove.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.256
Exactly, and those weapons
get in the wrong hands,

15:53.300 --> 15:55.389
someone could make
a lot of noise. A lot.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.521
All right, how many enemy on target?

15:57.565 --> 16:00.872
ISR is showing no activity
outside; inside's unknown.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.179
All right. We hit it tonight.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.572
Sundown, wheels up.

16:04.615 --> 16:05.616
That's it. Let's go, boys.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.227
Come on.

16:23.808 --> 16:24.896
What's up?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.768
I think I've been here before.
Yeah?

16:29.814 --> 16:31.903
Yeah.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.122
Nothing on the blackside.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.080
All right, we'll go through
the front door.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.733
Havoc, this is 1.We pass Mustang.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.561
Let's move. On you.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.997
He came in here.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.433
Yeah, well,
he didn't just disappear.

17:26.348 --> 17:29.309
Trent, Thirty, dresser.
Flush him out.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.050
Ray? On me.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.703
Roger that.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.057
How the hell did he know that?

18:04.953 --> 18:06.085
Got him?

18:06.128 --> 18:07.303
Come on.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.088
Pull him out.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.089
Let's see what
these boys are hiding.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.873
Okay, Cerberus, check here.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.875
Good boy.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.485
Hey. You believe

18:15.529 --> 18:17.226
Jason's clearing the same
building over again?

18:17.270 --> 18:19.315
I mean, this guy knows
Afghanistan

18:19.359 --> 18:20.925
better than he knows
his own home.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.146
Talk to me, man. Where is it?

18:24.190 --> 18:26.975
Where? Where? Ray!

18:27.018 --> 18:27.932
He's just praying.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.499
Check here. Yeah?

18:29.543 --> 18:31.240
Yeah?
I've got something.

18:31.284 --> 18:34.287
Clear it. Clear it.
Clear it. Clear it.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.115
Clear it.
Hey. Bring Full Metal in.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.900
Switch-switch with Brock.
Get it. Let's go.

18:38.943 --> 18:39.944
Pull that.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.601
Yep.

19:17.068 --> 19:20.028
Bravo 1!
Yeah?

19:20.071 --> 19:22.335
You're gonna want
to see this.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.908
You got to be kidding me.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.086
Take a look.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.657
So much for a
treasure trove.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.138
This is a dry hole.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.417
I take it this means

20:01.461 --> 20:03.419
you didn't interpret
yesterday's dry hole

20:03.463 --> 20:05.378
as evidence justifying
the drawdown?

20:05.421 --> 20:06.683
No.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.598
No, 'cause somebody knew
where those weapons were

20:08.642 --> 20:10.513
and they have a plan for 'em.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.385
You got anything to back that up?

20:12.428 --> 20:15.649
These are all the SIGACTS
in our area of operation.

20:15.692 --> 20:18.086
Compared to the
activity in our A.O.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.566
last time we were
here, this is nothing.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.046
Makes it look like peace
with Taliban is working.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.439
But looks can be deceiving.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.006
These are all the SIGACTS

20:25.049 --> 20:27.269
from Marine and Army units
in surrounding A.O.s.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.315
Things are crazy
along the border.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.795
The limited action here has
given a false sense of security,

20:31.839 --> 20:33.797
but all of this activity
on the border,

20:33.841 --> 20:35.799
this indicates that
the enemy is close by.

20:35.843 --> 20:39.107
And somebody is just waiting to
take advantage of us leaving.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.240
I mean, the-the dots
are all there.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.937
But you're still missing the
hard intel that connects them.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.202
And to do that, I
need access to intel

20:47.246 --> 20:48.769
from sources other than SOCOM.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.379
Even some

20:50.423 --> 20:52.338
that don't always like to share.

20:53.426 --> 20:56.037
I'll see what I can do.

21:13.141 --> 21:18.799
There used to be a couple
hundred head of cattle up there.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.105
Wow.

21:21.149 --> 21:22.498
What's he done to this place?

21:22.542 --> 21:25.196
Hannah Oliver.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.375
Hey there, Emmet.

21:29.418 --> 21:33.117
You are a sight for
sore eyes, young lady.

21:33.161 --> 21:35.381
Ah...

21:37.557 --> 21:40.995
Ah, I appreciate you coming
all the way up here

21:41.038 --> 21:43.040
and classing up
the place.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.694
Always happy to help.

21:44.738 --> 21:47.001
Though, uh, need
I be concerned

21:47.044 --> 21:49.351
about you maybe falling
into some bad habits

21:49.395 --> 21:51.005
or something,
considering the...

21:51.048 --> 21:52.398
company you're
keeping lately?

21:52.441 --> 21:54.530
Now, don't worry. We ain't gonna be staying for long.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.706
Figured you got
a better place to be.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.621
Actually, I brought dinner.

22:00.754 --> 22:06.107
Well... I guess I'll
set the table, then.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.502
You bamboozled me.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.460
Well, he's probably
lonely out here.

22:11.504 --> 22:12.809
Yeah, well, that's what happens

22:12.853 --> 22:15.203
when you push everyone
in your life away from you.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.514
Damn it, dork,
you winged me, man.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.385
Sorry, dude. A little
itchy trigger finger here.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.647
Can you blame me?

22:24.691 --> 22:26.519
Not with this feeling like
a Gucci deployment.

22:26.562 --> 22:29.086
Minus the fun stuff.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.959
Waste of a Tier One asset,
sending us here, man.

22:32.002 --> 22:35.049
Russia, China and Iran
expanding their footprints,

22:35.092 --> 22:36.529
we'd be better served elsewhere

22:36.572 --> 22:39.053
Is it me or does Clay
talk more cake-eater

22:39.096 --> 22:40.446
than pipe-hitter?

22:40.489 --> 22:42.273
I told you, man,
my boy's bilingual.

22:42.317 --> 22:46.277
That's why Lindell was trying
to recruit his ass

22:46.321 --> 22:47.627
for STA-21.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.585
But he didn't get him.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.587
Wait.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.372
Is this what your girlfriend
was talking about

22:53.415 --> 22:54.851
when she asked if you'd told
the team yet?

22:56.244 --> 22:57.767
You listening in on my Skype calls?

22:57.811 --> 22:59.508
Uh, more like watching.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.989
I mean, she's stupid hot and
I've been downrange for months.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.860
Wait a minute. Nah.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.427
What's he talking about, Clay?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.821
Hey. Let's go.
Let's move. All right?

23:07.864 --> 23:09.431
We were sloppy on target
yesterday, all right?

23:09.475 --> 23:10.563
Come on.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.826
Get up. All right,
stop with the juice.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.349
Let's go.
Put the book down.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.698
Let's move.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.526
Let's get our stuff together,
come on.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.572
Hello?
Is it something I said?

23:19.615 --> 23:21.661
Nah, Clay was about to tell us

23:21.704 --> 23:23.880
about STA-21.
STA-21?That's put to bed.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.926
Nothing to say about it.
Isn't that right, Clay?

23:27.928 --> 23:30.321
Clay?

23:30.365 --> 23:33.150
I accepted Lindell's offer.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.025
Son of a bitch.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.552
Clay, let him cool down, man.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.467
Clay!

23:45.511 --> 23:46.729
Hey.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.644
I should've
told you sooner, man.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.167
Three years of dealing with your ego

23:50.211 --> 23:51.865
and your second-guessing
and this is the thanks I get?

23:51.908 --> 23:54.041
Jace, I appreciate everything
you've done for me, man, I do.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.479
It's not personal.
You're telling me

23:57.523 --> 23:58.828
not to take
this personal?

23:58.872 --> 24:01.396
You come to deployment
with one foot out the door

24:01.440 --> 24:03.267
and you're telling me not
to take this personal?

24:03.311 --> 24:06.836
Now my team has to suffer
because of this distraction.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.447
Thank you.

24:08.490 --> 24:11.058
This distraction?
Yeah. Distraction.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.494
A d-distraction from what?

24:12.538 --> 24:15.062
From watching this-this
base just disappear?

24:15.105 --> 24:17.151
Jace, there's nothing
happening here, man.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.240
What...?Nothing happening, so what
are you gonna do, huh?

24:19.283 --> 24:20.850
You just gonna jump off
the speeding train,

24:20.894 --> 24:22.156
is that what you're gonna do?

24:22.199 --> 24:24.158
Jump off the speeding train?
Yeah. Yeah.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.943
Look around, man...
the speeding train has
become a merry-go-round.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.946
You're hitting the same targets
that you hit years ago,

24:29.990 --> 24:31.339
this whole place
is coming down,

24:31.382 --> 24:33.167
and now, now we're making
peace with our enemy?

24:33.210 --> 24:34.908
That is not my concern.

24:34.951 --> 24:39.260
My job is my mission
and the safety of my men.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.262
That's my job. Got it?

24:41.305 --> 24:43.525
That's my concern.
Yeah.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.613
Exactly.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.574
Team guys like you
have suffered so much

24:48.617 --> 24:50.140
executing the mission here.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.316
Look at Trent.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.796
Look at Trent's arm!

24:53.840 --> 24:55.668
Look at all of our brothers
on that plaque.

24:55.711 --> 24:58.061
Look how much sacrifice
we have made.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.588
Read the papers. The...Read the papers?

25:02.631 --> 25:04.328
The brass now admits
that they mishandled this war.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.852
That's great, right?
So what, are you gonna be

25:05.895 --> 25:07.114
with the brain trust now,
is that what you want to do?

25:07.157 --> 25:08.550
You want to be
with the brain trust?

25:08.594 --> 25:09.899
Look, I want to be in a
position where I can help

25:09.943 --> 25:11.205
reshape how these
wars are fought,

25:11.248 --> 25:12.598
so that, that way,
operators never have to be

25:12.641 --> 25:14.034
in this same position again.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.256
My three weeks here has only
justified my decision

25:19.300 --> 25:21.128
to change paths.
You want to change paths,

25:21.171 --> 25:22.999
that's what you're gonna do?
Fine, pack your bags.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.219
You're heading to COP Redding.
You're gone.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.408
So how you been, Emmet?

25:40.451 --> 25:41.888
Well, can't complain.

25:41.931 --> 25:45.282
Still vertical.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.633
Except all you got is the
wind to keep you company.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.549
What the hell happened
to all the livestock?

25:50.592 --> 25:53.029
Someone finally interested
in the family business

25:53.073 --> 25:54.683
after all these years?

25:54.727 --> 25:57.686
Wow, I'm surprised that you
even know what that word means.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.470
Sonny.
It's all right, darling.

25:59.514 --> 26:02.343
Percival always was a whiner.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.389
Don't ever call me that again.

26:05.433 --> 26:06.303
It's your Christian name.

26:06.347 --> 26:08.001
I gave it to you.
Yeah.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.959
That was your first
and last act as a father.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.352
All right, go ahead.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.441
Let's hear you
rewrite history, boy.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.271
I'm-I'm sorry,
maybe I'm mistaken.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.316
But didn't you drop me
off at my grandninny's

26:19.360 --> 26:21.405
when I was eight years
old because you just

26:21.449 --> 26:22.624
couldn't cut it?
And And somehow

26:22.668 --> 26:24.931
I managed to put a roof
over your head,

26:24.974 --> 26:26.759
and you thank me

26:26.802 --> 26:30.371
by slipping away,
never to look back again.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.286
Oh, yeah.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.244
Can't believe I...

26:34.288 --> 26:36.246
I didn't yearn for all this:

26:36.290 --> 26:40.468
a ranch as empty as the man
sitting in front of me.

26:41.817 --> 26:43.993
All right, now,

26:44.037 --> 26:45.821
let's try to have a little respect

26:45.865 --> 26:48.737
since this is my house.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.130
And you are still my son.

26:52.915 --> 26:55.614
I stopped being your son
the day Mama died.

26:55.657 --> 26:59.748
You do this in your own time,
in your own space.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.837
But not at my table.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.404
That's fine, man.

27:03.447 --> 27:06.625
Let's go.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.758
I'm sure that car's probably
up on blocks, anyways.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.064
It's in the barn.

27:11.107 --> 27:13.501
This time maybe you're
gonna run away in style.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.637
My colleague's been boots on the
ground for almost 11 months,

27:18.680 --> 27:20.639
so he has access to intel I don't.

27:20.682 --> 27:23.772
But heads up, he's
pretty sure of himself,

27:23.816 --> 27:25.774
so if he's toeing
the party line,

27:25.818 --> 27:28.429
he might not
want to help.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.083
Reiss.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.911
This is Ensign Lisa Davis

27:31.954 --> 27:33.390
from DEVGRU.

27:35.305 --> 27:36.742
Well, that explains...

27:36.785 --> 27:38.134
where you learned how to shoot.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.353
You two know each other?

27:39.396 --> 27:40.702
Not formally.

27:40.746 --> 27:41.834
I'm, uh, Reiss Julian.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.357
CIA.
Mm-hmm.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.489
Not contractor.
Mm-hmm.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.709
What can I do?

27:47.753 --> 27:49.276
Ensign Davis needs our help.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.278
I think the peace process is
a dam that's about to break.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.584
Okay. Coming in hot.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.935
I have a limited scope of intel,

27:55.978 --> 27:57.763
but there's been an
increase in IED attacks

27:57.806 --> 28:00.591
and direct fire engagements
just outside the A.O.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.028
As soon as we leave,
the enemy's coming here.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.073
Right. A power vacuum.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.901
Attitude around
here seems to be

28:05.945 --> 28:07.990
that'll be the Taliban's
problem once we're gone.

28:09.252 --> 28:11.690
We can at least figure out
who might be coming.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.692
I'd like access to everything
that you've put together.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.998
Interview transcripts,
intel from sources.

28:16.042 --> 28:21.134
Listen, your intentions
are in the right place,

28:21.177 --> 28:24.050
and I don't necessarily
disagree with you.

28:24.093 --> 28:27.140
But I can't shift priorities
away from this drawdown

28:27.183 --> 28:29.185
just based on a hunch.

28:31.448 --> 28:32.754
This is pointless.

28:32.798 --> 28:35.017
This car's probably
been rotting since I left.

28:35.061 --> 28:38.542
'Cause old Emmet
only cares about himself.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.029
Wow.

28:56.343 --> 28:57.431
Huh.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.175
Kind of makes you wonder
what else

29:02.218 --> 29:04.220
you've been wrong about,
Sonny Quinn.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.139
Yeah.

29:11.140 --> 29:14.143
♪ You think I'm wearin' down ♪

29:14.187 --> 29:17.581
♪ I'm movin' for the kill ♪

29:17.625 --> 29:21.020
♪ You think you can count me out, yeah ♪

29:21.063 --> 29:24.023
♪ You're in my wheelhouse ♪

29:27.200 --> 29:30.029
♪ You're in my wheelhouse... ♪

29:31.073 --> 29:32.509
Uh, hey.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.729
Let me know when
you're done over here.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.818
We could use a bar
in JSOC, too,

29:36.862 --> 29:38.211
liven up this
deployment.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.953
The op's tempo's messing
with your rhythm, too?

29:40.996 --> 29:43.172
Yeah, not as bad as you, though.
How's the team?

29:43.216 --> 29:45.000
The team's got their heads
all over the place.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.306
It's just Ray's

29:46.349 --> 29:47.916
concerned about his family,
he wants to be back.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.526
And Clay, well, you know,

29:49.570 --> 29:52.442
Clay's just concerned
about his new career, so...

29:52.486 --> 29:55.445
I hear you're sending
him to COP Redding.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.056
I'm sending him to COP Redding

29:57.099 --> 29:58.971
because he is a distraction right now.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.537
He's messing
with the team dynamics,

30:00.581 --> 30:02.365
he doesn't need to be here,
he's not focused.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.019
So he's out.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.629
Natalie a distraction, too?

30:05.673 --> 30:07.022
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Is that why you banished her?

30:07.066 --> 30:08.415
Natalie?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.243
Sorry, Ray told me.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.114
Yeah.
I thought you guys
were good together.

30:12.158 --> 30:13.202
Yeah.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.204
My priority is my team right now.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.598
Can't have my head
all over the place.

30:17.641 --> 30:20.209
When Bravo is in the sandbox,
I'm here, I'm focused.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.428
Doing my job.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.169
Sheepdog protects
his flock.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.258
It doesn't leave much room
for anything else.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.869
Well, you know, that's
called sacrifice, Mandy.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.654
What are you
protecting Bravo from?

30:30.698 --> 30:34.267
Three months of peace
talks and dry holes?

30:36.312 --> 30:38.010
Still a war zone.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.447
We're in Afghanistan.
It's a war zone.

30:40.490 --> 30:41.883
Danger around every corner,

30:41.927 --> 30:44.973
so, yeah, Bravo needs meto keep my eye on the target.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.410
Maybe you need it
more than they do.

30:47.454 --> 30:48.847
What's that mean?

30:48.890 --> 30:50.674
It means that
convincing yourself that

30:50.718 --> 30:52.459
Bravo's under threat

30:52.502 --> 30:54.765
is a way of justifying
your decisions.

30:59.901 --> 31:02.164
Stay safe out there.
All right.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.166
That's a good boy.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.042
Hey, you take care, bro.
Yeah.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.687
Yo.
All right,
listen up.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.602
key leader engagement
is taking place

31:48.645 --> 31:51.387
between an Afghan
National Army contingent,

31:51.431 --> 31:53.041
the U.S. State Department,

31:53.085 --> 31:54.782
and now that they're considered
a legitimate government entity,

31:54.825 --> 31:56.479
the Taliban.

31:56.523 --> 31:59.004
The KLE will be taking place
at a Taliban compound,

31:59.047 --> 32:01.267
approximately 30 klicks away.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.704
There will be an ISR platform
overhead the entire time.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.140
So, ROE?

32:05.184 --> 32:07.664
This is a strategic-level
diplomatic mission.

32:07.708 --> 32:08.927
If you have to shoulder
your rifles,

32:08.970 --> 32:10.015
things have gone sideways.

32:10.058 --> 32:11.277
Oh, are we supposed
to win 'em over

32:11.320 --> 32:12.495
with our hearts
and minds now?

32:12.539 --> 32:14.106
What happens if

32:14.149 --> 32:15.890
they're not actually here
to make peace?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.892
After years of war,
everybody wants peace.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.155
So we're just personal
security detail?

32:20.199 --> 32:21.635
Right?
Yeah.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.506
All right, look,
we'll run two trucks, uh...

32:23.550 --> 32:24.986
Up-armored SUV is the principal.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.119
Trent, I want you
to ride in the lead car.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.990
Negative.
Negative?

32:29.034 --> 32:31.950
No. You'll be providing
security for our

32:31.993 --> 32:34.082
State Department
representative here.

32:34.126 --> 32:36.084
However, Bravo Team will not
be leading the convoy.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.564
Hold on.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.174
If we're not, then who is?

33:00.021 --> 33:01.980
You seeing this?

33:04.025 --> 33:05.157
Salaam, my friend.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.028
Even let 'em in the gates
now, huh?

33:07.072 --> 33:09.030
A show of good faith.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.640
The first of many.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.425
Right, is that why you're
rolling into the meeting first?

33:12.468 --> 33:14.122
You know, you should
be riding with us.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.471
Times have changed.

33:15.515 --> 33:17.821
As a representative of
the Afghan government,

33:17.865 --> 33:19.649
I must go ahead and
set up the meeting.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.087
I'll, uh, see you guys in a few hours.

33:22.130 --> 33:25.046
Mm.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.439
Think this is gonna work?

33:28.528 --> 33:30.051
I don't know.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.010
I'm more accustomed
to war than peace.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.663
We both are.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.970
War needs men like us.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.103
Men like us need war.

33:38.146 --> 33:40.627
I, for one, got tired
of waiting for a day

33:40.670 --> 33:41.889
we no longer had to fight.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.151
You will, too, one day.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.674
Nah, man, I got
a lot of people

33:44.718 --> 33:47.547
counting on me to stay
in the fight, my friend.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.896
I might be one of them.

33:48.939 --> 33:51.899
This is Afghanistan, after all.

33:51.942 --> 33:53.770
All right, look.
You know what?

33:53.814 --> 33:55.772
We've been dealing with
these clowns for years, man.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.557
There's no need to be
careless, you understand?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.124
What, you think
we're being set up?

33:59.167 --> 34:00.212
The fighting's got
to stop sometime.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.648
18 years is enough.

34:01.691 --> 34:05.782
Who decides that, them or us?

34:21.668 --> 34:23.103
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

34:23.148 --> 34:27.065
Jack Daniels' TOT is 1:20.
You're five mikes out.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.849
Roger that.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.068
We're on this track
straight through.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.069
We're almost there.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.072
We're getting channelized
ahead.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.159
Check out the terrain.

34:35.203 --> 34:36.987
I'm less worried
about the terrain

34:37.031 --> 34:38.685
than our new friends
up ahead.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.252
We have to at least try
and trust them, J.

34:40.295 --> 34:41.253
There's a lot riding
on this KLE, man.

34:41.295 --> 34:42.688
Come on, "trust"and the "Taliban"?

34:42.732 --> 34:44.168
Those two words don't go
together, Ray, you know that.

34:44.212 --> 34:46.040
Uh, they're stopping.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.215
All stop.

34:49.870 --> 34:53.221
It's not a planned stop.
We're almost to the compound.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.227
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

34:59.271 --> 35:00.924
Be advised you have
what appears to be

35:00.968 --> 35:02.187
enemy activity in the hills,

35:02.230 --> 35:04.580
left flank, about 400 meters.
How copy?

35:04.624 --> 35:06.104
That's good copy.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.193
J, if this is an ambush,
we need to get off the "X."

35:08.236 --> 35:09.107
There's no cover out here.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.891
If this was an ambush, Ray,

35:10.934 --> 35:12.762
the Tali trucks would have
moved out already.

35:12.806 --> 35:14.895
Trent, get some glass on those hills.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.288
Call it when you see it.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.985
Ray, cover me.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.117
Copy that.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.610
If they're there,
I'm not seeing 'em.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.233
Can you understand
what they're saying?

35:48.276 --> 35:50.191
No, they-they're talking over
each other, talking too fast.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.584
Something's got 'em
spooked, though.

35:51.627 --> 35:53.063
Those guys look twitchy.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.674
We're gonna get chewed up
if we don't pull out of here.

35:54.717 --> 35:55.718
Yeah, he's right.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.147
Jace, they're looking twitchy.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.193
Someone's gonna get scared,
open up.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.542
Then I suggest it be us.

36:39.022 --> 36:41.460
Look...

36:41.503 --> 36:42.939
a body count's not gonna
help our mission.

36:42.983 --> 36:43.984
Lower the weapons.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.162
Lower the weapons.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.208
Low port, guys.

36:53.733 --> 36:54.995
No, no, no.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.217
Hey. Let's go.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.350
Let's just lower the guns.

37:03.351 --> 37:05.135
Lower the guns. Salaam.

37:05.179 --> 37:06.528
No, no, no, no.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.095
Lower the guns.

37:08.138 --> 37:11.272
That's it. Lower.

37:11.316 --> 37:12.708
See? It's so easy.

37:20.977 --> 37:24.677
Vehicle 2.
Stay with DOS, ANA.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.069
We'll call you when we're clear.

37:26.113 --> 37:29.247
Trent, Ray, Thirty Mike,
you're with me. Let's go.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.509
Havoc, this is 1.

37:30.552 --> 37:31.901
I need an ISR sitrep.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.163
Need to know what's coming
on our flank.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.817
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

37:34.861 --> 37:37.124
Unknowns are moving away
from the meeting site.

37:43.130 --> 37:46.133
There's Jack Daniels' car.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.270
The place looks
like a ghost town.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.545
Ray.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.039
J!

39:21.794 --> 39:23.361
Private Elliott Mounds.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.319
We, uh, don't get many
visitors out here

39:25.363 --> 39:26.451
besides resupplies.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.278
I hear you're with
the SEAL teams.

39:28.322 --> 39:29.671
Clay. Yeah.

39:29.715 --> 39:34.372
That's COP Redding.
Welcome to the suck.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.737
Did you know the massacre
was gonna happen?

39:51.780 --> 39:54.435
No. Of course not.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.263
But you did.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.574
Cutting off the victims' hands
means somebody thinks

40:02.617 --> 40:05.446
those peacemakers are traitors.

40:05.490 --> 40:10.320
Or do you still think
I'm just going off a hunch?

40:10.364 --> 40:12.279
I think that
you have uncovered

40:12.322 --> 40:14.847
the next chapter
in this bloody war.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.849
So...

40:16.892 --> 40:19.982
whatever you need...

40:20.026 --> 40:21.767
it's yours.

40:23.508 --> 40:26.467
At first I thought you were
just gunning for recognition.

40:26.511 --> 40:31.429
But what you're looking for is
gonna be much harder to find.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.518
Wait, you're not shooting
tonight?

40:33.561 --> 40:37.391
Nah. But maybe we could
grab dinner sometime.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.436
I know this great chow hall.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.659
Have fun blowing off steam.

40:44.703 --> 40:46.313
You got a lot of work to do.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.593
We lost a brother today: JD.

41:05.637 --> 41:09.510
So we honor him by
doing what we do,

41:09.554 --> 41:10.380
and that's fight.

41:10.424 --> 41:11.730
And we fight for each other.

41:11.773 --> 41:12.948
So, to Jack Daniels.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.472
To Jack.

41:14.515 --> 41:16.474
Yeah.

41:30.575 --> 41:32.925
You good?

41:35.493 --> 41:38.234
Yeah, I just, uh...

41:38.278 --> 41:40.802
can't get that image of
Jack's hand out of my head.
Yeah.

41:40.846 --> 41:43.544
Someone's looking
for a fight, Ray.

41:43.588 --> 41:47.113
We're gonna need Clay
if it comes down to that.

41:47.156 --> 41:48.244
Yeah.

41:48.288 --> 41:49.332
A lot of good that's gonna be.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.552
His head's already stuck
at STA-21.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.467
You can't fault the kid,
brother, I mean,

41:53.511 --> 41:56.252
he still thinks he's fighting
to change the world.

41:59.865 --> 42:01.214
What are you
fighting for, Ray?

42:03.216 --> 42:05.523
What are you fighting for?

42:07.263 --> 42:09.570
I left my family
making a home without me,

42:09.614 --> 42:12.312
what, to come out here
and run out the clock

42:12.355 --> 42:14.793
while this country finds
a new way to implode? I...

42:14.836 --> 42:18.144
Three-foot world.
Affect what you can control.

42:18.187 --> 42:20.276
The rest will take care
of itself.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.845
I got to make it home, J.

42:23.889 --> 42:26.152
I can't have Jameelah
spending the rest of her life

42:26.195 --> 42:27.588
thinking her father was a liar.

42:27.632 --> 42:30.548
The rest will take care
of itself.

42:32.462 --> 42:34.639
I got your back, buddy.
You're gonna make it home.

42:34.682 --> 42:37.555
Get in there and call Naima.
Everything's gonna be good.

42:37.598 --> 42:39.818
Gonna be good.
Tell her I said hello.

42:39.861 --> 42:41.863
Yeah.

42:42.908 --> 42:45.084
Hey...

42:45.127 --> 42:47.129
don't you got a call to make
back in the hooch?

42:49.654 --> 42:51.612
Nah.

42:53.614 --> 42:55.747
I'm exactly where I need to be.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.793
Copy that.
