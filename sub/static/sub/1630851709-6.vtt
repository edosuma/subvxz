█

00:01.034 --> 00:07.607
reads words on screen

00:10.009 --> 00:13.980
<i>Tonight, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada.</i>

00:14.047 --> 00:16.916
A storm is definitely on its
way to Paradise.

00:19.018 --> 00:20.687
There are so many girls here.

00:22.589 --> 00:23.923
There's new girls that are
walking in and

00:23.990 --> 00:25.825
I'm getting scared
to lose you.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.262
Naturally, I'm going to be
a bit protective of

00:29.329 --> 00:30.263
what we've got.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.631
Better not steal my man.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.999
Campers...

00:34.367 --> 00:36.970
What's gonna get thrown
my way today?

00:37.036 --> 00:40.507
It's the Camp
Paradise bonfire.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.675
But, with a little bit
of a twist.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.411
- Always a twist.
- Of course!

00:44.477 --> 00:46.613
I think there are some
people that are thinking

00:46.679 --> 00:48.782
they're gonna take
some serious heat.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.750
Kamil, I don't want to pick
on you, buddy, I swear.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.752
Sounds like you are.

00:52.819 --> 00:55.355
Both Kamil and I have
a target on our back.

00:55.422 --> 00:56.756
You're in love?

00:56.823 --> 00:58.658
Enough is enough
and I am over it.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.793
I can't win here.

00:59.859 --> 01:02.562
Paradise is going up in flames.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.831
A little drama can be
exciting, right?

01:04.898 --> 01:06.766
I'm definitely open.

01:06.833 --> 01:09.469
I'm not closed off to
meeting new people.

01:09.536 --> 01:10.770
What the hell is he doing?

01:10.837 --> 01:12.705
I go after what I want.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.275
I don't think she's afraid
to step on toes.

01:15.341 --> 01:17.610
Nope, I don't think
she gives a

01:17.677 --> 01:19.846
I don't know how, like,
you wouldn't be able to

01:19.913 --> 01:21.981
see why that would
upset somebody.

01:22.048 --> 01:23.917
Alright, Caitlin!

01:23.983 --> 01:25.852
I just feel stupid.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.287
Part of me just wonders,
like,

01:27.353 --> 01:29.055
is the whole thing,
like, ruined?

01:29.122 --> 01:30.957
Sorry.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.843
Alright, let's find a
nice little spot.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.746
- Oh, it is nice out.
- Barber shop is open, boys.

02:59.812 --> 03:00.780
Let's go.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.015
So, it's a new
day in Paradise.

03:02.081 --> 03:04.384
It's nice to be back
outside on the beach.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.020
The sun is beaming and,
the girls are looking good.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.928
So just good vibes, have some
fun and just chill.

03:14.994 --> 03:16.930
- Wow...
- Oh, wow.

03:16.996 --> 03:17.864
- Wow.
- Wow.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.800
It feels like I'm at camp
in high school.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.803
We just talk about who's cute
and who has the nicer abs.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.073
Wow... wow.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.442
Josh, what's the jacket
situation going on?

03:29.509 --> 03:32.946
It looks like a little Chanel,
like a tweed situation.

03:33.012 --> 03:33.780
Yeah!

03:33.846 --> 03:35.448
You guys want to go in
the cabana?

03:35.515 --> 03:36.883
I didn't know if you
had one or not.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.718
Oh, thank you.

03:38.785 --> 03:41.955
Last night was a little bit of
a roller coaster ride,

03:42.021 --> 03:42.956
if you will.

03:43.022 --> 03:45.091
I heard that you went and
talked to Caitlin?

03:45.158 --> 03:47.927
Asked her, you wanted to go on
a little date-ski or something?

03:47.994 --> 03:49.896
Yeah, I did, yeah.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.565
At the end of the day, he did
what he felt was right.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.067
But, it just sucked.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.102
He seems like he cares
about you a lot.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.170
He does.

03:57.236 --> 04:00.039
So, like, I just don't
understand why it happened.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.908
Vay has my back.
But also, like,

04:01.975 --> 04:03.977
I know my opinion is like
the one that matters most.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.612
And I know that I'm good
with Mike right now

04:05.678 --> 04:07.513
́cause he was honest.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.515
Maybe the timing wasn't
the best to do it

04:09.582 --> 04:13.786
the day after you got a
rose from Stacy.

04:13.853 --> 04:14.754
I agree.

04:14.821 --> 04:15.955
It's like, obviously,
we all get caught up

04:16.022 --> 04:17.757
in the moment
in here, but...

04:17.824 --> 04:19.759
He just overdosed on too
many dumbass pills.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.961
- Yeah.
- That's it.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.530
I just feel like the people who
are coupled up, like,

04:24.597 --> 04:26.933
everyone says that
they're open, but it's like,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.203
I don't get the impression
that they would budge.

04:30.269 --> 04:33.706
I am intimidated by the
couples. Definitely.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.109
But, I don't want it to
deter me ́cause

04:36.175 --> 04:37.810
I know that I want that.

04:37.877 --> 04:39.879
Sorry to interrupt.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.581
Do you mind if I pull
you away, Joey?

04:41.648 --> 04:42.582
Yeah, surely.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.083
Oh, she's pulling Joey.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.786
Nicole is absolutely stunning.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.022
So, I just wanted to get
to know you more.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.024
See how you're
enjoying Paradise.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.693
Yeah, well, I mean, Paradise
has been pretty good so far.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.095
I can't complain.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.765
Wow, he is so handsome.

05:00.633 --> 05:01.901
Guys, does it mean
I really like him

05:01.968 --> 05:03.202
if I'm stressed right now?

05:03.269 --> 05:04.270
- Yes!
- [Beep]!

05:04.337 --> 05:05.605
We're kind of guessing like,

05:05.672 --> 05:07.573
if we'll get some
new people today.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.042
Better not steal my man.

05:09.108 --> 05:10.109
I'm not ready for it.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.611
- More options.
- I know, eh?

05:11.678 --> 05:13.279
- Hm...
- Yeah.

05:18.851 --> 05:21.654
Last night was hard with Kamil.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.990
I feel really bad for the
new people coming in.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.658
I know a lot of couples
are forming and

05:25.725 --> 05:27.093
they're really
like pretty solid.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.530
But, when a girl comes in and
asks for like a date card,

05:30.596 --> 05:34.033
if you turn it down, it's kind
of like disrespectful in a way.

05:36.102 --> 05:39.906
I'm not a jealous person,
but naturally,

05:39.972 --> 05:43.576
I'm gonna be a bit protective of
what we've got at this point.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.578
Do you want to go on a date?
- No, no, no, no, no!

05:45.645 --> 05:47.680
No, don't put
me into context.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.882
All I can do is trust him.

05:56.155 --> 05:58.024
My time here in Paradise,

05:58.091 --> 06:01.561
I will not chase,
I will attract.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.796
Oh, there's a new girl
right there.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.298
You're right.

06:05.365 --> 06:10.103
I am worthy of love and all the
attention and everything good.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.939
We have a new guest.

06:13.005 --> 06:16.609
I said my affirmations.
I'm ready to go.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.778
Oh! Another brunette.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.813
- I don't recognize her.
- I feel confident.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.116
- Hello, new people.
- Hi!

06:23.182 --> 06:24.717
- How you doing?
- I'm Sasa.

06:24.784 --> 06:25.985
- Sasa, I'm Brendan.
- Nice to meet you.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.187
We do hugs here.
Yeah, yeah.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.923
Hi, my name's Sasanet, but
everyone calls me Sasa.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.126
I'm 26 and I'm from Halifax,
Nova Scotia.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.895
- Hi, I'm Caitlin.
- Caitlin, nice to meet you.

06:35.962 --> 06:36.796
- What's your name?
- Sasa.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.865
Everyone's gonna be
obsessed with me.

06:38.931 --> 06:40.199
What were your
names again? I forget.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.234
- Joey.
- Brendan.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.468
- Brendan?
- Yeah.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.638
I'm super interested to see,
like, who's not getting along.

06:45.705 --> 06:46.906
Who's super messy.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.875
Tell me about the drama?
Is there any drama?

06:48.941 --> 06:50.610
Oh, God, you got 5 hours?

06:50.676 --> 06:52.145
- Really?
- There's a lot going on.

06:52.211 --> 06:55.948
As of the last rose ceremony,
sending 4 guys home,

06:56.015 --> 06:57.617
that was kind of-
- Oh, wow!

06:57.683 --> 07:00.620
Joey, he likes to gossip,
I can tell.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.121
It's peaceful for now,
I mean, but you,

07:02.188 --> 07:05.291
you ladies are coming in, so...

07:05.358 --> 07:06.159
Well...

07:06.225 --> 07:09.128
The vibe I'm bringing to
Paradise is fun,

07:09.195 --> 07:11.764
confident, a little messy.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.833
Honestly, I don't think she's
afraid to step on toes.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.735
Nope. I don't think
she gives a

07:15.802 --> 07:16.636
Yeah.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.671
A little drama can
be exciting, right?

07:18.738 --> 07:19.906
Did you talk to everybody?

07:19.972 --> 07:22.175
I, honestly, some of them look
alike so it's hard for me-

07:22.241 --> 07:23.743
-
- ...to tell.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.912
- Big, buff, and hot?
- Yeah!

07:25.978 --> 07:27.280
- Hi!
- I'm Sasa.

07:27.346 --> 07:28.381
I'm Mike.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.750
Mike is very welcoming.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.885
Do you feel like you've had a
lot of connections with people?

07:32.952 --> 07:37.023
I picked a girl, we hit it off.
But, everybody's open.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.391
Mike is a beautiful man.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.360
He mentioned that he has a
connection with someone.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.831
But, in Paradise, until he
proposes, he's fair game.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.899
Okay, so I have a date card.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.001
- Woo!
- Read it.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.870
"Don't let this chance
slip away".

07:50.937 --> 07:52.972
- Slip away!
- Ooh!

07:53.039 --> 07:54.707
- Water slides?
- So...

07:54.774 --> 07:56.442
Mike, do you wanna...?

07:56.509 --> 07:57.777
- Mike!
- Mike!

07:57.844 --> 07:59.745
- Yeah.
- Hey!

08:01.447 --> 08:02.882
- Have fun, guys.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.184
- Have fun!
- Do you need another drink?

08:05.251 --> 08:07.320
- Yes!
- A yummy shot.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.358
Could things have
gone better? Of course.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.926
I'm not someone's
second choice.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.395
Like, go, go explore and
come back and then

08:16.462 --> 08:18.130
tell me that I'm your
first choice.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.932
This said "slip away"
so I'm assuming it has

08:19.999 --> 08:21.901
something to do with water.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.941
Are you excited for this date?

08:29.008 --> 08:31.744
I am not sure what we're in for,
but what was the card?

08:31.811 --> 08:33.412
Something to do with slipping.

08:33.479 --> 08:36.215
I'm always a good time.
Even if we don't connect,

08:36.282 --> 08:38.451
like, most men have an
amazing date with me

08:38.518 --> 08:40.953
because like, I'm just
fun to go out with.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.722
Oh, I almost just
slipped right now.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.224
Depending on where we go.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.827
- Oh, dear!
- This is crazy.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.197
It's a slip 'n slide.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.399
I haven't done
this in 25 years.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.302
It looks fun,
looks dangerous.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.738
Okay, so that makes sense!

08:58.804 --> 09:00.907
I am 100% an indoorsy girl.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.109
Warm, cozy, luxury.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.378
8-year-old Mike
is ready to go!

09:05.444 --> 09:08.147
Pave the way,
Mike, please.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.349
I'm gonna take my shirt off.
Feel free to take yours off.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.151
Ah.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.987
You're funny,
it's off.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.791
Mike looks very good
with his shirt off.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.826
I'm very proud of him.
He's done well.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.461
He will go far in life.

09:22.528 --> 09:23.996
- Alright.
- Oh...

09:24.063 --> 09:26.499
- Splish and splash time.
- Okay.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.072
I actually feel like he's a
little bit excited for this.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.986
Gravity doesn't treat me
the same anymore.

09:47.053 --> 09:50.056
However, that's not gonna
stop me from a good time.

09:50.122 --> 09:52.024
Okay, now I feel pressure.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.160
I don't even know
how to do this.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.528
Okay, alright.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.097
I'm like nervous of what's
gonna pop out or

09:58.164 --> 10:00.166
what's gonna
fall off, like...

10:00.232 --> 10:04.303
Go at it hard, hard, hard.

10:04.370 --> 10:07.373
Almost.
I tried my best.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.476
- Are you even wet?
- A little bit.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.212
My first experience was
absolutely horrible.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.414
Passive booty bump.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.849
And...

10:18.618 --> 10:21.220
Mike is obsessed.

10:24.890 --> 10:28.327
Grab the ankle, okay, got it.
Now what?

10:28.394 --> 10:30.997
-
- Oh, wow!

10:31.063 --> 10:35.001
Mike pulled me towards the end
of the slip 'n slide, like Thor.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.303
- Yes!
- That's better, okay.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.904
Was he as good as Thor?

10:38.971 --> 10:42.608
No, but he really like
met my expectations.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.911
Oh, my God!
We did it!

10:45.978 --> 10:47.947
I'm pretty sure I cut up his
ankles with my nails,

10:48.014 --> 10:49.582
but he did a wonderful job.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.583
Are you done with this?

10:50.649 --> 10:53.352
Yes, I'm ready for, like,
the next chapter.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.421
He can grab a beer,
I'll have a cocktail.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.859
We'll have a good time.
We'll figure it out.

11:03.562 --> 11:06.198
I cannot wait to take you for
a ride in the Pil-billy.

11:09.368 --> 11:10.636
- Okay, not in Toronto.
- We'll see.

11:10.703 --> 11:11.971
- No.
- We'll talk about it later.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.106
No, no, no.
I draw the line.

11:14.173 --> 11:17.076
Joey always makes me
feel special.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.245
I definitely have not had
this feeling before.

11:19.311 --> 11:20.613
I don't know, like,
I have a hard time

11:20.679 --> 11:23.282
actually expressing
how this feels.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.550
Yeah, exactly,
I don't get it.

11:24.617 --> 11:25.885
There's new girls
walking in and

11:25.951 --> 11:27.353
I'm getting scared
to lose you.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.222
I'm like, shit, I actually
really like him.

11:30.289 --> 11:32.925
I'm like, is this, is this,
is this it, girls?

11:32.992 --> 11:35.561
Oh, my God, I'm scared.
Someone takes him on a date.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.496
I'm like, he's mine.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.065
- Yes, I am.
- He's mine.

11:39.131 --> 11:42.501
Yes, I am.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.237
I'm just worried
because things have...

11:45.304 --> 11:46.972
shifted very quickly here.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.109
And as confident as I am,
the fear's always there

11:50.176 --> 11:52.545
because beautiful,
amazing women walk in...

11:52.611 --> 11:54.313
all the time.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.616
Yeah, just walk in front of me
for a second.

11:57.683 --> 11:59.685
Okay, we're good.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.023
Looks cozy.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.558
We need something
cozy after that.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.626
While my slip 'n slide
experience was absolutely

12:07.693 --> 12:11.697
horrible, I am definitely ready
to get to know Mike better and

12:11.764 --> 12:14.066
I'm so ready for the
second half of the date.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.537
Toast, toast to you
arriving in Paradise.

12:18.604 --> 12:19.505
Thank you.

12:19.572 --> 12:23.142
And taking me-
ha-ha-ha- out on a date.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.343
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah, cheers.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.078
- Cheers.
- Appreciate that.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.615
Someone like Mike is who
I should be going after.

12:29.682 --> 12:33.385
But I am more into mean men,
you know,

12:33.452 --> 12:35.955
a little bit rough,
a little bit rude.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.490
Let's get into
the nitty gritty.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.525
Mm! Grill me.

12:39.592 --> 12:43.162
- What's your type?
- Female.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.098
Well, no-
what's your type?

12:46.165 --> 12:47.600
Be as shallow as you
would like to be.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.668
- I'm curious.
- Okay.

12:49.735 --> 12:54.273
I like someone who takes
care of themself. Um...

12:58.277 --> 13:00.212
Conversation is not flowing.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.182
You can hear the crickets.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.184
- Um...

13:05.251 --> 13:07.419
What music do you like?

13:07.486 --> 13:11.590
Ah, mostly like old-school
R&B, hip-hop...

13:11.657 --> 13:14.460
Occasional pop.
I'm open.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.563
- Okay.
- Mhm.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.631
What are you into?

13:18.697 --> 13:21.100
What about like hardcore metal?
- Absolutely not.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.269
It stresses me out.
I get stressed.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.104
It's like so intense.
Is that what you do?

13:25.171 --> 13:28.774
Um...

13:28.841 --> 13:32.011
Everything he said to me was
just so unappealing.

13:32.077 --> 13:34.180
So, what's like your favourite
thing to do for fun?

13:34.246 --> 13:35.714
I like going hiking.

13:35.781 --> 13:38.551
Oh, I'm a city girl.
Take me to the mall.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.453
Okay...

13:43.622 --> 13:45.090
I think we differ in that.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.592
Yeah, we do!

13:46.659 --> 13:49.195
Mike and I have
nothing in common.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.397
What would you prefer to do,
go camping?

13:51.463 --> 13:53.165
Or go to a restaurant?

13:53.232 --> 13:55.067
Why do we always
have to go hiking?

13:55.134 --> 13:56.769
Well, there's like cute
wineries in the forest.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.538
I do not have any quality
that he wants.

13:59.605 --> 14:00.773
I would drive him crazy.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.376
She's Mrs. Yin
and I'm Mr. Yang.

14:13.886 --> 14:16.655
You would love,
you would love...

14:16.722 --> 14:19.358
- A safari.
- Hell, yeah, I would.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.494
- Campers!
- Jesse!

14:22.561 --> 14:24.063
Come down and
join me, please.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.665
- Oh, what a surprise.
- Oh, what's he doing here?

14:26.732 --> 14:30.169
Jesse calls us all over and,
you know, it's Paradise.

14:30.236 --> 14:33.472
What's gonna get
thrown my way today?

14:33.539 --> 14:37.309
It is a beautiful evening, as
you can see, in Paradise.

14:37.376 --> 14:41.547
And, I'm excited because
I have a very special

14:41.614 --> 14:43.616
treat for you
all this evening.

14:44.483 --> 14:47.253
It's the Camp
Paradise bonfire.

14:47.319 --> 14:48.387
Oh...

14:48.454 --> 14:50.422
But, with a little bit
of a twist.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.423
- Of course!
- Always a twist.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.727
There's always a twist.
You know that, right?

14:54.793 --> 14:58.130
Honestly, I'm not
excited at all.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.198
I'm pretty excited.

14:59.265 --> 15:02.401
I just love a little, a little
drama in Paradise.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.470
It never stops.

15:04.536 --> 15:06.639
I feel like this bonfire's
definitely like

15:06.705 --> 15:09.642
brewing up some
trouble in Paradise.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.744
A storm is definitely
on its way.

15:19.318 --> 15:20.786
I know after spending so
much time together,

15:20.853 --> 15:23.689
you guys have probably
developed some questions

15:23.756 --> 15:24.790
that you want to ask.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.992
You might be wondering about
someone's intentions.

15:27.059 --> 15:30.362
Or maybe it's some feelings
that have been developing

15:30.429 --> 15:32.531
but you haven't been able to
unpack those yet.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.467
No topic is off limits.

15:35.534 --> 15:39.238
And, it's all anonymous.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.340
- Oh...
- That's portentous.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.676
I think there are some
people that are thinking

15:43.742 --> 15:47.346
they're gonna take
some serious heat.

15:47.413 --> 15:48.781
Here's how it's gonna work.

15:48.847 --> 15:51.417
Over at the bar there

15:51.483 --> 15:55.254
a stack of cards
and a lockbox.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.489
YouR only job, take one
of the cards,

15:57.556 --> 16:00.392
write the question that you
have for your fellow camper...

16:00.459 --> 16:04.496
and drop it into the box.
Sound good?

16:04.563 --> 16:07.933
This is an opportunity for you
to go for the truth.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.636
I'm nervous because
I've been put under

16:10.703 --> 16:12.404
the microscope
every single day.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.939
But like, it never stops.

16:14.006 --> 16:17.676
Take your time with this.
Use the questions wisely.

16:17.743 --> 16:21.580
- Alright?
- Bye, Jesse!

16:21.647 --> 16:24.984
Interesting, ah?
Cards, questions.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.652
What's coming
my way tonight?

16:26.719 --> 16:28.354
Oh, no.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.755
Well, there we are,
fire me up.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.459
Okay... where do I start?

16:33.525 --> 16:35.327
- What do you think, four?
- He's writing a novel.

16:35.394 --> 16:36.929
Joey's writing a
novel over there.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.064
How many you writing
down over there?

16:39.131 --> 16:40.466
Oh, I got shade for days.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.373
We got slipping,
we got sliding.

16:47.439 --> 16:48.874
Yes, for sure.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.509
I think you're gonna enjoy
the sunsets here.

16:50.576 --> 16:54.046
- Absolutely, it's beautiful.
- They're back!

16:54.113 --> 16:55.948
- Hi!
- Hello!

16:56.014 --> 16:58.417
- Long time no see.
- Hello.

16:58.484 --> 17:01.353
Probably like to snag you
just for a wee chat.

17:01.420 --> 17:05.023
I aim to tell Stacy exactly
how I feel about her and

17:05.090 --> 17:06.725
what she means to me.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.360
I want to talk to you
about the date.

17:08.427 --> 17:09.495
Yeah.

17:09.561 --> 17:13.499
The way I felt, like, I always
talk about energy a lot.

17:13.565 --> 17:15.834
It was just not there.

17:15.901 --> 17:19.371
What's important for
you to know is...

17:19.438 --> 17:23.842
that my feelings for you and
the date that we had,

17:23.909 --> 17:26.378
it was so good.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.113
Oh, my God.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.081
I missed you while you
were gone and

17:29.148 --> 17:31.617
I'm glad that you went
and experienced it.

17:31.683 --> 17:32.985
I think that's what
Paradise is all about.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.820
It's like going and
exploring connections.

17:34.887 --> 17:39.558
But, I'm very thrilled...

17:39.625 --> 17:41.560
to be coming home to you.

17:58.744 --> 18:02.748
I just know it.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.918
I feel like everyone here has
an opinion about Kamil and I.

18:05.984 --> 18:08.086
It's like this,
like looming energy.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.922
Like, I feel like we're
the topic and,

18:09.988 --> 18:12.858
I really don't
understand why.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.760
- Look at you!
- I'm not looking at it.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.463
Look at you! I see you.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.903
I think the bonfire is
definitely a foreshadowing that

18:24.970 --> 18:28.674
Paradise is going up in flames
after these questions.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.176
- Rules in Paradise.
- That's right.

18:31.243 --> 18:34.847
- Alright, guys.
- Drum roll.

18:34.913 --> 18:39.117
- Question #1.
- Let's see.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.553
"Everyone...

18:41.620 --> 18:43.856
if you had to pick another
person to get to know,

18:43.922 --> 18:45.924
who would you pick?"

18:48.694 --> 18:50.496
Awkward.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.799
Not at all.
Michael?

18:53.866 --> 18:56.068
I feel like I tried this and
got rejected already.

18:59.605 --> 19:03.175
Okay. I would say somebody
new coming in here so,

19:03.242 --> 19:06.645
it would be you, Bianka.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.881
Post campfire here,
we're gonna have some

19:08.947 --> 19:12.885
conversations about
answers and questions asked.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.854
Mikey, boy, why didn't you
tell Stacy about your

19:15.921 --> 19:20.459
interest in Caitlin before
the rose ceremony?

19:20.526 --> 19:23.729
I didn't consider that.

19:23.795 --> 19:28.033
Ah, I just did it when I could
actually find Caitlin.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.735
- Good answer.
- Yeah.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.637
Couldn't find
her for a week.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.605
What?

19:33.672 --> 19:35.073
Know a guy that keeps
her pretty busy.

19:35.140 --> 19:38.076
I'm just a ghost
on the beach.

19:38.143 --> 19:41.013
I'm hearing these questions
and I just know

19:41.079 --> 19:45.217
something brutal
is coming my way.

19:47.786 --> 19:50.088
Kamil, do you not realize
all the girls

19:50.155 --> 19:51.523
notice you
checking them out?

19:51.590 --> 19:53.258
Or do you just not care?

19:53.325 --> 19:55.827
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.801
I'll take full ownership
for this question.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.770
All the girls have
expressed to me that

20:04.836 --> 20:10.008
Kamil's got wandering eyes.
So, Kamil...

20:10.075 --> 20:13.579
do you know?
Or you just don't care?

20:13.645 --> 20:15.747
Speak for yourself card.

20:15.814 --> 20:18.217
Yeah. I mean...

20:18.283 --> 20:19.952
what can I say?

20:20.018 --> 20:24.690
A lot of beautiful girls
in Paradise.

20:24.756 --> 20:28.193
I'm- I feel like eyes
wander, but it's...

20:38.103 --> 20:39.838
I don't know how to answer this
question, but I mean,

20:39.905 --> 20:42.908
there's a lot of beautiful
people here in Paradise, so...

20:42.975 --> 20:45.644
I didn't think I was checking
them out, but if,

20:45.711 --> 20:49.881
if that's the case, I guess,
um... I'll admit to it.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.950
There's a lot of beautiful
people here in Paradise.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.623
I'm at a beach.
I did look around and I-

20:57.689 --> 21:00.659
you know, everyone
does that. It's natural.

21:00.726 --> 21:05.130
Oh, God. I'm gutted,
to be honest. It's like...

21:05.197 --> 21:08.033
I swear to God,
it's one step forward and

21:08.100 --> 21:10.302
two steps back with
him every day.

21:13.372 --> 21:16.875
- Last one.
- Last one.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.812
"Vay, are you falling in
love with Joey?

21:20.879 --> 21:22.781
Because I'm falling in
love with you.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.583
Yours truly, Joey."

21:24.650 --> 21:26.084
Who the wrote
that question?

21:31.923 --> 21:34.860
I'm definitely getting there,
but it's gonna take me

21:34.926 --> 21:36.662
a little bit longer to get
there just because

21:36.728 --> 21:38.930
I have a lot of
trust issues.

21:38.997 --> 21:43.802
But there's nothing so far
that's gonna stop me.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.841
Well, my heart's warm.
I don't know about you guys.

21:53.345 --> 21:56.381
I'm seeing other people's
connections really form here

21:56.448 --> 21:59.284
and like, Kamil and I
have gone through

21:59.351 --> 22:02.087
our fair share
of speed bumps.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.855
I just think he could have
answered that question

22:03.922 --> 22:05.724
so much better than he did.

22:14.132 --> 22:17.135
Ugh, I don't know, that,
that question is literally

22:17.202 --> 22:18.804
just like eating away at me.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.338
I just hope that
this isn't like,

22:20.405 --> 22:23.675
this isn't actually like a thing
that's like going on, too.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.977
You're just picking on me right
now, just to like clarify.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.646
I'm not picking
on you at all.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.148
I already had like two shitty
questions aimed at me.

22:30.215 --> 22:32.718
How do you think I felt, like,
at that moment?

22:32.784 --> 22:36.221
Right now, I'm meeting her up
here and she's still...

22:36.288 --> 22:39.191
trying, but it's- we're not
at the same parallel.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.893
In these moments,
it's like am,

22:41.960 --> 22:44.329
am I getting everything
that I need?

22:44.396 --> 22:45.931
You could have said anything
else that would have been nicer.

22:45.997 --> 22:49.034
Alright, Caitlin, like I'm
not 18 years old.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.670
Like, I don't need somebody
to correct me.

22:51.737 --> 22:55.440
Clearly, something's like not-
something's missing here.

22:55.507 --> 22:57.275
Like, I don't, I don't know
how else to put it.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.177
If you believe that then,
like,

22:59.244 --> 23:00.779
I don't know
what to tell you.

23:10.021 --> 23:11.356
Ugh,
I don't know, that,

23:11.423 --> 23:13.692
that question is
literally just like

23:13.759 --> 23:15.193
eating away at me.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.763
I want somebody who's like
got eyes just for me.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.765
Like, not...

23:19.831 --> 23:22.367
on everyone else.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.735
That's me.

23:23.802 --> 23:26.071
Like, who the hell am I
checking out here?

23:26.138 --> 23:27.739
I don't know, you just
said everyone.

23:27.806 --> 23:29.141
No, I'm not.

23:29.207 --> 23:30.342
I just hope that
this isn't like,

23:30.409 --> 23:33.745
this isn't actually like a thing
that's like going on, too.

23:33.812 --> 23:34.846
It's just kind of bizarre.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.048
Alright, Caitlin. The way I
delivered it sucked and

23:37.115 --> 23:40.452
I wish I said it differently,
but I'm apologizing right now.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.454
Okay.

23:42.521 --> 23:45.257
I'm frustrated, I'm upset,
I'm disappointed.

23:45.323 --> 23:47.459
The apology was very lacklustre.

23:47.526 --> 23:50.061
I didn't feel like it was
like overly sincere,

23:50.128 --> 23:52.731
to be honest. And I felt
like he wasn't putting

23:52.798 --> 23:54.900
himself in my position
in that moment.

23:54.966 --> 23:57.903
I don't know how like you
wouldn't be able to see

23:57.969 --> 24:01.072
why that would
upset somebody.

24:01.139 --> 24:03.875
I can only say something
in so many ways.

24:07.078 --> 24:10.048
Whatever came out of
my mouth, I said.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.984
And I'm manning up to it, and I
don't need anyone to tell me

24:13.051 --> 24:15.153
that, you know, I said
something in a wrong way.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.122
Yeah, everybody here
in Paradise

24:17.189 --> 24:20.358
has checked each other out.
It happens every single day.

24:28.433 --> 24:30.435
You guys chatted?

24:30.502 --> 24:32.404
- A little bit.
- Yeah.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.841
So, what'd you guys think of
the whole question-answer

24:35.907 --> 24:38.009
bonfire experience?

24:38.076 --> 24:41.112
Some of the questions
were a little off,

24:41.179 --> 24:43.181
in my opinion, but...

24:43.248 --> 24:45.984
I think both Kamil and I have
a target on our back.

24:46.051 --> 24:47.919
I don't know why.
I don't know why everyone's

24:47.986 --> 24:51.957
so concerned about us,
but... yeah.

24:52.023 --> 24:54.192
As far as why you're
targeted, you,

24:54.259 --> 24:57.863
you two remove yourselves so
much from the group.

24:57.929 --> 25:00.265
I'm just kind of over it
at this point.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.567
Caitlin and Kamil
haven't really

25:02.634 --> 25:04.436
opened themselves
up to the group.

25:04.502 --> 25:07.038
At this point, I'm just like a
little bit confused as...

25:07.105 --> 25:10.041
who they are as people.

25:10.108 --> 25:12.210
That's why we all came here,
it's like to explore

25:12.277 --> 25:13.511
relationships and make
connections.

25:13.578 --> 25:15.547
And like, I've liked getting
to know you guys.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.582
I wish I could get to
know both of you.

25:17.649 --> 25:20.252
Have I been bouncing
around the beach being

25:20.318 --> 25:22.520
super chummy with
everyone? No.

25:22.587 --> 25:24.522
But I'm here to
find my person.

25:24.589 --> 25:28.293
And, if that means I want to
spend the entire day with him,

25:28.360 --> 25:31.229
like, damn straight I'm gonna
spend the entire day with him.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.865
You have a 10 out of 10
relationship right now?

25:33.932 --> 25:36.234
- Right.
- I think that about Stacy.

25:36.301 --> 25:39.938
Now, how do I know my 10 out of
10 is an actual 10 out of 10

25:40.005 --> 25:44.442
if I don't go out there and
try to go on a date with Sasa?

25:44.509 --> 25:46.311
Man, you got Stacy right here.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.481
Stop worrying about my
relationship with Caitlin.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.083
I'm ready to lose
it with Mike.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.351
When you have
something special,

25:53.418 --> 25:56.288
I feel like I want to
be there for her,

25:56.354 --> 25:57.556
and I don't want
to let her go.

25:57.622 --> 26:01.626
I don't want to explore anymore
́cause I've been exploring.

26:01.693 --> 26:03.962
Once you find something
special in life,

26:04.029 --> 26:06.231
I feel like you should
keep it close.

26:06.298 --> 26:09.601
There are a lot of things

26:09.668 --> 26:12.370
that they're hiding
from each other.

26:12.437 --> 26:15.173
And I was just there to...

26:15.240 --> 26:17.509
feel that out and see if
they would admit it.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.544
And they won't.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.313
We have different approaches.

26:21.379 --> 26:24.482
We do have different
approaches, Michael.

26:24.549 --> 26:27.218
I'm just thinking, like,
when is this guy gonna stop?

26:27.285 --> 26:30.188
It is like, getting to a
point where it's,

26:30.255 --> 26:32.023
enough is enough,
and I'm over it.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.359
I feel like I
can't win here.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.994
I really can't.

26:36.061 --> 26:40.198
Kamil's getting defensive
because I'm passively attacking.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.401
Ah...

26:43.468 --> 26:45.937
I'd be happy to leave today
with Caitlin and,

26:46.004 --> 26:47.339
just making it work
in the real world.

26:47.405 --> 26:50.342
- That sounds like love to me.
- Mhm.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.444
Would you say then
you're in love?

26:57.182 --> 27:00.452
I take those three words
very seriously.

27:00.518 --> 27:04.522
I'm definitely in like, but
when I'm ready to say that,

27:04.589 --> 27:09.661
it will be, you know, from the
deepest parts of my heart.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.229
They would leave
Paradise tomorrow,

27:11.296 --> 27:13.098
but they're not ready to
say, "I love you".

27:13.164 --> 27:16.434
The easiest thing to do would
be to leave Paradise.

27:16.501 --> 27:17.635
Well, you're not gonna
make it in reality.

27:17.702 --> 27:19.938
If you can't make it here,
you're not gonna make it there.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.152
I feel like we need
an activity today.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.286
I feel like we do too.

27:35.353 --> 27:36.388
Brendan and I are
trying to get-

27:36.454 --> 27:37.555
we've been wanting to
play baseball.

27:37.622 --> 27:39.657
It's a new day in Paradise!

27:39.724 --> 27:43.361
Can't wait to see what
drama today brings.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.397
I think that'd be fun, like
a group baseball game.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.399
- A little whiffle ball.
- I'm down for that.

27:47.465 --> 27:49.567
Let's try to
make that happen.

27:56.141 --> 27:57.742
Oh, I think we're getting
some more company.

27:57.809 --> 27:59.611
- So, boy or girl coming in?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.112
- Girl.
- Agh.

28:11.222 --> 28:12.424
My name is Iva.

28:12.490 --> 28:15.226
I'm 25 and I come
from Calgary.

28:15.293 --> 28:19.364
I'm fiery, I'm blunt,
and I'm fun.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.467
- Hi, friends.
- Hello.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.768
- Hi!
- Hi, Bianka.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.403
- Iva, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.038
- Are you Polish?
- I'm Serbian.

28:27.105 --> 28:28.373
- Oh, are you?
- Yes!

28:28.440 --> 28:30.608
I'm so aggressive
in my pursuits.

28:30.675 --> 28:32.510
Guys, I waved to you.

28:32.577 --> 28:34.512
I know, we were like,
"Hey, girl!"

28:34.579 --> 28:36.114
I go after what I want.

28:36.181 --> 28:37.749
I'm so happy to be here.

28:37.816 --> 28:42.520
So, my first impressions of Iva
are, yeah, she has a lot energy.

28:42.587 --> 28:44.289
- Hi, how you doing?
- I'm stressed.

28:44.355 --> 28:45.757
She has a big a...

28:45.824 --> 28:46.724
big character.

28:46.791 --> 28:49.427
So, tell me about your,
like, relationship.

28:49.494 --> 28:50.729
You guys are
boyfriend-girlfriend, right?

28:50.795 --> 28:52.597
- Someone told me.
- She's pretty forward.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.699
Ah, I'm stressed.

28:54.766 --> 28:57.535
She's outspoken, doesn't
bite her tongue.

28:57.602 --> 28:59.270
I hope that someone
like likes me and

28:59.337 --> 29:01.439
wants to dedicate
themselves to me.

29:01.506 --> 29:04.642
She is just blunt.

29:04.709 --> 29:06.444
everybody's
coupled up.

29:06.511 --> 29:07.479
I know, it's hard.

29:07.545 --> 29:09.547
And that's coming from me.

29:09.614 --> 29:12.417
- Where do you live?
- Ah...

29:12.484 --> 29:14.786
- How old are you?
- Ah...

29:14.853 --> 29:17.322
Iva is very headstrong.

29:17.388 --> 29:20.391
- What do you do?
- Ah...

29:20.458 --> 29:22.460
She's borderline crazy,

29:22.527 --> 29:25.363
but that's perfect
fit for Paradise.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.631
- First day here.
- Yes.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.299
- How are you feeling?
- I'm nervous.

29:28.366 --> 29:29.200
Yeah, okay.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.669
So, what has your journey
so far been?

29:31.736 --> 29:34.339
Yeah, I mean, I got here, went
on a date, had a lot of fun.

29:34.405 --> 29:37.208
After the date, I started
talking to Lisa who's-

29:37.275 --> 29:38.643
I hang out with most
of the time now.

29:38.710 --> 29:42.080
Someone else has a hand
around her right now.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.249
Just saying.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.684
Well, like I said, this is
Paradise and everything-

29:46.751 --> 29:48.419
I mean, I wouldn't have
my hand- like,

29:48.486 --> 29:50.755
nobody would have their hand
around me if we were a thing.

29:50.822 --> 29:54.559
Yo!
I like you.

29:57.228 --> 29:59.230
That's so spicy!

29:59.297 --> 30:01.566
You're way spicier than I
thought you were!

30:01.633 --> 30:04.536
You are way spicier
than I thought you were.

30:04.602 --> 30:05.770
So...

30:05.837 --> 30:08.673
so, I don't know how serious
that is, but I'm just saying.

30:08.740 --> 30:09.908
Like, I don't know.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.378
Being straight forward does get
me in trouble a little bit.

30:19.250 --> 30:20.618
- Hey, friends.
- Hello.

30:20.685 --> 30:22.720
- I have a date card.
- Oh!

30:22.787 --> 30:25.290
- Read us your card.
- Okay, let's check it out.

30:25.356 --> 30:30.528
"Love is in the air."
- Yeah...

30:30.595 --> 30:32.664
Josh, want to go on
a date with me?

30:32.730 --> 30:34.465
Alright, love is in the air.

30:34.532 --> 30:35.867
- Have fun.
- Nice!

30:35.934 --> 30:38.403
Okay. Let's walk down
the beach together.

30:38.469 --> 30:40.305
- Absolutely.
- Have fun, you two!

30:40.371 --> 30:42.240
Thank you!

30:42.307 --> 30:44.375
Damn, he's been a
hot commodity now.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.711
- I'm like...
-

30:46.778 --> 30:48.246
Don't impress her too much.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.480
That's the kind of girl
every man wants.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.282
- Yeah.
- You got him.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.817
I'm so jealous.

30:56.721 --> 30:59.490
- So, what's up?
- Nothing.

30:59.557 --> 31:01.326
I feel like I haven't gotten
to hang with you all day.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.361
We've been here together
the whole day!

31:03.428 --> 31:07.565
I feel like since last night
was such a total mind [beep],

31:07.632 --> 31:11.502
I'm going to focus on, you know,
talking to Caitlin and,

31:11.569 --> 31:14.339
and just telling her what I
need out of this relationship.

31:14.405 --> 31:16.741
That conversation about like,
the stupid question game,

31:16.808 --> 31:19.210
it like kind of threw me off a
little bit yesterday.

31:19.277 --> 31:20.111
What do you mean?

31:20.178 --> 31:21.813
I just want you to be-
have my back,

31:21.880 --> 31:23.348
as much as I have your back.

31:23.414 --> 31:24.382
Of course, I do.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.217
I don't want you to question
any single thing.

31:26.284 --> 31:28.353
Like, there's a lot of you
beautiful people here,

31:28.419 --> 31:30.688
but I'm not like a peeping
Tom checking girls out.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.224
I thought there was maybe a
better way it could have been

31:33.291 --> 31:36.294
handled, but it's not like
I was like mad at you.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.229
But I felt like you
were a little bit.

31:38.296 --> 31:40.665
I want you to be in my corner
and supporting me instead of,

31:40.732 --> 31:42.367
like, making...

31:42.433 --> 31:45.536
a little bit of a big deal
about it last night.

31:45.603 --> 31:48.573
Have I not been supportive?
Am I like totally losing it?

31:48.640 --> 31:49.874
Who did I make a
big deal about it?

31:49.941 --> 31:51.342
I literally talked
to you about it.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.677
Yeah, just to me.
But like, still.

31:52.744 --> 31:53.811
How is that
making a big deal?

31:53.878 --> 31:55.713
I'm talking to you
about my feelings.

31:55.780 --> 31:58.983
I know you are. But like,
what I said was honest and,

31:59.050 --> 32:01.252
I don't feel like I need to
reassure you all the time

32:01.319 --> 32:03.521
that like, yeah,
I'm that guy.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.257
I think you should
know that by now.

32:06.324 --> 32:09.761
I don't understand how
things got manipulated and

32:09.827 --> 32:11.996
spun back around to me.

32:12.063 --> 32:13.765
I just want you there for me.
That's the way-

32:13.831 --> 32:17.402
- I'm so here for you.
- Yeah.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.671
I still don't really know
what gaslit means.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.573
But in that moment, I think
that's what that was.

32:27.979 --> 32:28.946
<i>Coming up...</i>

32:29.013 --> 32:31.316
Do you think another girl
could shake things up?

32:31.382 --> 32:33.284
Yep.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.253
- Good job.
- Thank you!

32:35.320 --> 32:36.854
Knowing how strong the
connections are?

32:36.921 --> 32:38.489
- Well, you have great lips.
- Thanks.

32:38.556 --> 32:39.791
You wanna check?

32:39.857 --> 32:43.361
- Maria, guest services!
- You're here?!

32:43.428 --> 32:45.997
Joey knows Maria.

32:46.064 --> 32:47.332
She's a really
nice girl though.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.266
I really like that girl.

32:48.333 --> 32:52.870
Stop talking about how
amazing Maria is.

32:52.937 --> 32:55.006
I really want you to just
focus on what we have.

32:55.073 --> 32:56.607
I just feel like every time I
start to trust somebody,

32:56.674 --> 32:58.309
it like blows up
in my face.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.285
Do you really like Josh,
because I didn't even

33:07.352 --> 33:08.686
know that you
guys had a thing?

33:08.753 --> 33:10.755
You've been here for a day!
Yeah, I like Josh.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.724
We're like usually
always together.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.625
No, not like in a shady way.
I'm just curious.

33:14.692 --> 33:16.427
Oh, okay, yeah,
yeah, I do.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.296
Josh is going on all these
different dates and

33:18.363 --> 33:20.531
it's literally like he's the
Bachelor in Paradise.

33:20.598 --> 33:23.368
It's like every new girl that
comes in, they pick him.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.436
So, I don't know if that means
I need to be more aggressive,

33:25.503 --> 33:26.838
or it looks like we're
not together.

33:26.904 --> 33:28.039
And I'm just like, alright,
everyone needs to

33:28.106 --> 33:29.707
back off my man's
a little, but...

33:29.774 --> 33:31.943
Okay, Mike,
you're with the guys,

33:32.009 --> 33:34.379
You know the inside scoop
in the cabins that

33:34.445 --> 33:36.280
we're not a part of.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.850
Do you think another girl
could shake things up,

33:38.916 --> 33:40.885
knowing how strong the
connections are?

33:40.952 --> 33:42.887
Yep.

33:42.954 --> 33:45.623
If someone comes in that has
been your ideal for a

33:45.690 --> 33:47.925
long time, then I feel like that
could totally change things.

33:47.992 --> 33:49.761
That's true.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.768
We have visitors.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.672
Why another girl?
Why?

34:01.739 --> 34:03.875
I don't know, Bianka.

34:03.941 --> 34:05.843
Hi, I'm Maria.
I'm 29 and

34:05.910 --> 34:08.579
I split my time between
Cartagena and Toronto.

34:08.646 --> 34:10.548
She looks hot,
I'm not gonna lie.

34:10.615 --> 34:13.885
I describe myself as
Canadian and Colombian,

34:13.951 --> 34:14.786
so there's like
the niceness,

34:14.852 --> 34:16.454
but there's also a
little bit of spice.

34:16.521 --> 34:17.755
I'm lots of fun.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.891
- Maria's here.
- Hi, Jesse.

34:19.957 --> 34:21.359
- How are you?
- I'm good.

34:21.426 --> 34:22.527
- How are you?
- I'm good.

34:22.593 --> 34:24.529
- Welcome to Paradise.
- Thank you.

34:24.595 --> 34:27.665
First runner up from Canada
chooses, right...?

34:27.732 --> 34:30.034
- Yeah, fashionably late.
- I love it.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.035
I love it, Maria.

34:31.102 --> 34:32.703
You're starting things off
on the right foot.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.939
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, my God.

34:35.006 --> 34:36.641
- With the date card.
- Thanks, Jesse.

34:36.707 --> 34:38.676
- Maria, welcome to Paradise.
- Thank you so much.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.978
- Have a blast.
- Alright, let's go.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.647
- Hi...
- Hi!

34:42.713 --> 34:45.416
- I'm Nicole.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

34:45.483 --> 34:47.385
I just don't know who she's
gonna go on a date with.

34:47.452 --> 34:48.753
Oh, my God, I don't
remember any names.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.588
I'm so sorry.

34:50.655 --> 34:53.524
Maria, Guest Services?
Maria, Guest Services?

34:53.591 --> 34:55.760
- You're here, Joey!
- How we doing?

34:55.827 --> 34:59.630
- Oh, my God. What?
- How are ya?

34:59.697 --> 35:01.099
Joey knows Maria.

35:01.165 --> 35:02.300
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

35:02.366 --> 35:04.569
Not so bad. I just made it
awkward for everyone, didn't I?

35:06.771 --> 35:08.539
Maria and I used to work
together in Toronto.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.008
Sweetheart of a girl.
We went on a date once.

35:11.075 --> 35:12.643
Ah, didn't go so well.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.045
Another girl was
blowing my phone up

35:14.112 --> 35:15.680
like 20 times that night.

35:15.746 --> 35:17.648
Long story, don't need
to get into it.

35:17.715 --> 35:19.584
- This is gonna be easier now.
- So much easier.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.986
- See, you're in now.
- Wow, great!

35:22.053 --> 35:23.087
You know somebody.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.622
I think Vay's fine.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.924
She's fine with me knowing
somebody else.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.693
Oh, they're together.
Okay, this is great.

35:28.759 --> 35:30.661
- She's really pretty.
- Yeah.

35:30.728 --> 35:32.130
Okay, so, what do you wanna-
what do you wanna know?

35:32.196 --> 35:33.564
Do you got questions?
I got answers.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.166
Um, yeah.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.969
- She might pick him.
- They went on one date.

35:38.035 --> 35:39.137
No, she won't pick him.
She won't-

35:39.203 --> 35:40.972
They didn't go on a second.

35:41.038 --> 35:42.740
So, who's with who?
Like, can you tell me?

35:42.807 --> 35:45.076
Yeah, so, these two right here,
the blonde and the guy in the

35:45.143 --> 35:48.412
white shirt. They're like
wifed up so don't even try.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.647
Kamil over here in
the blue shirt is

35:49.714 --> 35:50.715
with Caitlin in the red.

35:50.781 --> 35:53.885
- Okay.
- Brendan M. and Ange.

35:53.951 --> 35:56.487
They're still talking.
That's just

35:56.554 --> 35:57.889
He'll give her the
lay of the land.

35:57.955 --> 36:01.058
Alex is hanging out
with Kit who is...

36:01.125 --> 36:03.661
the blonde in like the flower
dress down here.

36:03.728 --> 36:05.496
Okay. Who are you with?

36:05.563 --> 36:07.164
Vay, brunette, blue eyes.

36:07.231 --> 36:09.033
- How's that going?
- Stupid good.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.635
- Oh, good!
- Stupid good.

36:10.701 --> 36:12.970
Like, how much do they
have to talk about?

36:13.037 --> 36:15.740
I did not expect to
find a connection

36:15.806 --> 36:17.675
as deep as I did with Vay.

36:17.742 --> 36:18.643
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:18.709 --> 36:20.511
That's sweet. So, everyone's
with someone?

36:20.578 --> 36:21.679
Kind of, yeah.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.814
Like, you're kind of coming
into a bit of a shit show.

36:23.881 --> 36:25.016
- Like, it's not-
- Uh-oh.

36:25.082 --> 36:28.119
Seeing this many women when
I first arrived to Paradise

36:28.186 --> 36:30.588
makes me feel so nervous.

36:30.655 --> 36:34.025
But, talking to Joey makes me
way less nervous.

36:34.091 --> 36:35.159
Some of your shit you've
been doing with

36:35.226 --> 36:37.128
your clothing has been sick.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.229
Oh, thanks, Joey.
You're so sweet.

36:38.296 --> 36:39.964
No, it's been really nice.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.866
The fact that Joey went on a
date with Maria before

36:41.933 --> 36:43.501
doesn't bother me.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.870
But, he's been talking to her
for a while and,

36:45.937 --> 36:48.639
at a certain point...

36:48.706 --> 36:51.876
I start feeling a little bit
uncomfortable.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.811
And it doesn't make me
feel good.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.480
There's five new
girls.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.553
Five extra girls.

37:06.023 --> 37:08.192
Love is in the air.
Oh, my God.

37:12.797 --> 37:13.998
Are you excited?
Woo!

37:14.065 --> 37:15.900
I'm excited.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.769
Josh is super sweet and
he's really handsome so,

37:18.836 --> 37:21.005
that doesn't hurt.
I'm here to find love so,

37:21.072 --> 37:23.107
let's hope sparks happen.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.575
- This is sick.
- You ready?

37:24.642 --> 37:26.043
- This is so awesome.
- I'm so ready.

37:26.110 --> 37:27.745
I'm excited to go on this
date with Iva because,

37:27.812 --> 37:30.848
I'm actually really just curious
on, who is this person?

37:30.915 --> 37:33.284
I feel like this is very
down your alley, Iva.

37:33.351 --> 37:35.553
- As a circus act?
- Yeah, they could not-

37:35.620 --> 37:37.555
I mean, there could not be
a better date for you.

37:37.622 --> 37:40.791
- Us. It's about us.
- Yeah, that's true.

37:40.858 --> 37:44.095
She is coming in hot.

37:44.161 --> 37:45.830
Legs up, hook your knees.

37:45.896 --> 37:48.866
We can do that.
I can

37:48.933 --> 37:50.034
Oh, yeah, I think I
can do that too.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.269
She seems like a crazy
adventure partner.

37:52.336 --> 37:55.072
And, that's definitely a
really positive thing.

37:55.139 --> 37:57.308
- Yeah!
- Woo!

37:57.375 --> 38:01.212
I'm 100% smitten with him.
I think he's, he's golden.

38:01.278 --> 38:02.780
Would you like to go first, or
would you like me to go first?

38:02.847 --> 38:04.015
- You go first.
- Alright, let's do this.

38:04.081 --> 38:05.716
If you die, I wait.

38:05.783 --> 38:06.884
I hope you're
ready to laugh.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.020
No, you're gonna kill it.

38:09.086 --> 38:10.755
I have never been on
a date with someone

38:10.821 --> 38:11.689
with so much energy.

38:11.756 --> 38:17.194
Paradise! Yes!
He's going off to a circus.

38:27.238 --> 38:30.274
- Yes!
- Woo!

38:30.341 --> 38:34.779
- You killed it.
- Thank you, thank you.

38:34.845 --> 38:36.347
Hell, yeah.
You're gonna love that.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.649
- You did actually really good.
- Thank you.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.017
- You ready for this?
- Yes.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.652
Okay. You got it.

38:41.719 --> 38:45.923
Alright! You got this, Iva.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.591
Woo, woo!

38:47.658 --> 38:50.695
Nice.

38:50.761 --> 38:53.064
Woo!

38:53.130 --> 38:56.300
- That was so

38:56.367 --> 38:57.535
She's wild. I mean,
there's no other way to put it.

38:57.601 --> 39:01.372
This girl is a cup of coffee
with a shot of vodka inside it.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.741
Thank you! Ha-ha!

39:03.808 --> 39:05.376
- This was sick.
- No, you killed it.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.678
My first trapeze
experience was so fun.

39:07.745 --> 39:09.313
I think you should
join the circus.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.248
What if we just...

39:13.184 --> 39:15.186
You should join the circus.

39:15.252 --> 39:16.721
I was gonna say we
should join the circus.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.223
Okay, we can join the circus.

39:19.290 --> 39:23.861
She's... pretty aggressive?
I mean, but that can be good.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.629
I mean, I like that she knows
what she wants.

39:25.696 --> 39:26.964
Well, I'm looking forward
to seeing what

39:27.031 --> 39:28.265
the second part
of the date is.

39:28.332 --> 39:30.167
I hope we get to make out.

39:35.806 --> 39:38.409
- Hello, pretty girl.
- Hi. How was your chat?

39:38.476 --> 39:39.810
I just gave her the
lay of the land.

39:39.877 --> 39:40.811
Told her what's what.
I said,

39:40.878 --> 39:42.380
"You're coming in
the lion's den. Have fun."

39:42.446 --> 39:43.714
She's a really
nice girl though.

39:43.781 --> 39:44.882
I really like that girl.

39:44.949 --> 39:49.086
Stop talking about how
amazing Maria is.

39:49.153 --> 39:50.087
I don't care if you go
on a date with her.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.723
Look, if I wanted to go
on a date with her...

39:52.790 --> 39:55.426
I wouldn't have just told her
everything I just told her.

39:55.493 --> 39:56.894
I don't know
what you told her.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.796
I get that I'm a flirt.
I know this.

39:58.863 --> 40:01.065
I can't help it. That's how
I interact with women.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.667
But, you need to
know I'm with you.

40:03.734 --> 40:04.869
So, that's where I was going,
I was like

40:04.935 --> 40:06.904
top notch, baby.

40:11.108 --> 40:12.009
Well, you look beautiful.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.077
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

40:13.144 --> 40:16.414
And your hair is like,
blowing my mind right now,

40:16.480 --> 40:18.716
- Is it a Colombian thing?
- I don't know.

40:18.783 --> 40:21.385
There are so many girls here
in Paradise right now.

40:23.888 --> 40:27.258
I feel like the ratio
is like 5 to 10.

40:29.326 --> 40:30.427
So, who are you with here?

40:30.494 --> 40:33.864
Oh, right to the...
oh, okay.

40:33.931 --> 40:34.932
- Stacy.
- Okay.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.935
I feel nervous because I'm
not super competitive.

40:38.002 --> 40:40.204
But, I felt like I
had to compete

40:40.271 --> 40:42.039
a little bit for attention.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.809
So, what's happening
with you here?

40:44.875 --> 40:46.710
Like, who are you with?
Are you happy?

40:46.777 --> 40:50.080
Yeah, so, I met Caitlin,
which is the girl in the red.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.348
And we've been, you know,

40:51.415 --> 40:53.317
evolving our
relationship so far.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.486
Are you open are you not?

40:55.553 --> 40:58.756
Right now, I'm like really,
you know,

40:58.823 --> 40:59.723
involved in our relationship.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.826
- Okay, that's fair.
- At the moment, so...

41:01.892 --> 41:03.861
I feel like I'm being
blocked a little bit.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.262
Well, it was nice
talking to you.

41:05.329 --> 41:06.497
Oh.

41:06.564 --> 41:09.733
The guys that are here right
now are kind of off the table,

41:09.800 --> 41:12.036
they're taken. But I have
to pick a date so,

41:12.102 --> 41:14.171
I'm really not sure
what I should do.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.113
<i>Coming up...</i>

41:23.180 --> 41:26.050
- Are you open, or no?
- Yeah, I'm definitely open.

41:26.116 --> 41:27.151
I'm not worried.

41:27.218 --> 41:30.087
Angela, we've spoken in the
past about this type of

41:30.154 --> 41:32.223
situation, if we were
ever approached.

41:32.289 --> 41:35.226
I don't want you to feel as
though me accepting this date

41:35.292 --> 41:37.761
takes away from any
kind of, you know,

41:37.828 --> 41:39.230
connection that
I have with you.

41:39.296 --> 41:41.765
Like, I'm not gonna tell you,
like, not to go, you know.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.375
So, who do you guys think,
out of everyone here,

41:51.442 --> 41:53.777
that Maria's gonna
ask on her date?

41:53.844 --> 41:55.479
- Apparently Joey knows her.
- Yeah.

41:55.546 --> 41:58.549
And went on a date with her
back... in Toronto.

41:58.616 --> 42:03.053
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know
who else she's talked with.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.255
- What?
- Nothing.

42:04.321 --> 42:09.260
I just was watching.
Just always watching.

42:09.326 --> 42:11.829
So, what's your whole
take on Paradise?

42:11.896 --> 42:13.230
Like, when you first came in,
were you excited?

42:13.297 --> 42:16.200
Well, I'm not nervous
anymore, which is great.

42:16.267 --> 42:20.538
So, my first impressions of
Brendan M., he's super nice.

42:20.604 --> 42:23.007
He also is really open with me.

42:23.073 --> 42:25.442
What are you- I guess, what are
you looking for when you,

42:25.509 --> 42:27.144
you know, when you decided
to come here?

42:27.211 --> 42:29.580
I'm just kind of living out
the experience and like,

42:29.647 --> 42:34.285
if something sparks, great.
You have to be open.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.587
I think being open is the
most important thing.

42:36.654 --> 42:38.022
No, I, I agree with you.

42:38.088 --> 42:40.457
I think a lot of people here
are kind of...

42:40.524 --> 42:42.126
in that same mindset.

42:42.192 --> 42:44.862
It's always great to meet a
new person here in Paradise.

42:44.929 --> 42:47.231
Maria's coming here with
pretty open mind,

42:47.298 --> 42:48.933
Really attractive girl.

42:48.999 --> 42:51.001
You know, she's got a
little spice to her so,

42:51.068 --> 42:52.870
I'm interested in
chatting with her.

42:52.937 --> 42:54.104
So, are you happy?

42:54.171 --> 42:55.406
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

42:55.472 --> 42:56.373
Yeah, I'm pretty
happy so far.

42:56.440 --> 43:00.577
- Okay, that's good.
- Are you open, or no?

43:00.644 --> 43:02.513
- Yeah, I'm definitely open.
- Okay.

43:02.579 --> 43:04.415
Yeah, yeah. I'm not
closed off to, you know,

43:04.481 --> 43:06.383
meeting new people and
seeing if there's, like,

43:06.450 --> 43:07.985
you know,
a possibility there.

43:08.052 --> 43:10.854
Angela, we've spoken in the
past about this type of

43:10.921 --> 43:14.058
situation, if we were ever
approached by someone new

43:14.124 --> 43:17.394
to go on a date, you know,
we'd, we'd both be...

43:17.461 --> 43:21.632
more than willing to allow
each other to do that.

43:21.699 --> 43:24.101
We need a, we need
your cabin 12 insight.

43:24.168 --> 43:26.236
Brendan, I think you're
getting asked on a date.

43:26.303 --> 43:28.105
Oh, God. I think so
too ́cause she-

43:28.172 --> 43:30.541
- What?
- I'm not worried.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.610
- Hey, Brendan.
- Hey, what's up?

43:32.676 --> 43:35.179
Would you like to go
on a date with me?

43:35.245 --> 43:37.514
Part of me is thinking,
like, Brendan M.

43:37.581 --> 43:39.450
is gonna say "no"
in that moment.

43:39.516 --> 43:42.186
And I'm hoping for Ange
that he does.

43:42.252 --> 43:44.121
Yeah, sure.

43:44.188 --> 43:48.058
But... he doesn't.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.893
-
- Alright?

43:49.960 --> 43:50.894
- Huh?
- See you later?

43:50.961 --> 43:53.364
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:53.430 --> 43:54.632
Okay...

43:54.698 --> 43:57.067
What the hell is he doing?

43:57.134 --> 43:59.269
- Alright, let's do it.
- Oh, God.

43:59.336 --> 44:01.372
- Sorry.
- No, you're good.

44:01.438 --> 44:05.409
What just happened?

44:05.476 --> 44:08.145
"Sorry", she says.

44:08.212 --> 44:11.615
I'm feeling a little
confused about that.

44:11.682 --> 44:14.451
That's not typical
behaviour from him.

44:14.518 --> 44:16.553
That was super awkward.

44:16.620 --> 44:18.389
- Was that bad?
- It wasn't bad.

44:18.455 --> 44:20.290
I wish it wasn't right in
front of her. I'm sorry.

44:20.357 --> 44:22.159
No, it's okay.

44:22.226 --> 44:26.330
I pick Brendan M. because I
just feel like our conversation

44:26.397 --> 44:29.266
was the best out of all the
conversations that I had.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.702
I've been stuck on this
beach for a while,

44:31.769 --> 44:34.271
I've yet to have my first
date here in Paradise.

44:34.338 --> 44:36.507
So, I'm really
excited for this.

44:36.573 --> 44:38.709
- He's coming right back.
- Yeah.

44:38.776 --> 44:40.344
- I'm not-
- I know, I know, I know.

44:40.411 --> 44:42.012
Am I pressed right now?
Am I pressed?

44:43.480 --> 44:45.482
It's just the
whole idea of it.

44:45.549 --> 44:48.218
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

44:48.285 --> 44:49.620
You know that he's coming
right back to you.

44:49.686 --> 44:53.624
Yeah, 100%.

44:53.690 --> 44:55.726
- We're good.
- Yeah.

45:00.397 --> 45:03.167
- Well, that was an adventure.
- Oh, my God, that was so fun.

45:03.233 --> 45:05.169
So far, the date's
been so exciting.

45:05.235 --> 45:08.305
Josh is super sweet.
He's gentle, polite.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.340
He does sound like he
had a connection

45:10.407 --> 45:12.209
with someone
else beforehand.

45:12.276 --> 45:14.111
So, we kinda gotta
take care of that.

45:15.412 --> 45:19.083
Oh, my God, well, your bottle
opening is- Spectacular.

45:19.149 --> 45:20.350
I don't know, it's about
to pour over.

45:20.417 --> 45:24.688
That's okay, you're excited.

45:24.755 --> 45:26.757
I definitely like how
positive Iva is.

45:26.824 --> 45:29.259
I like that she's forward.
I like that she just

45:29.326 --> 45:31.361
unforgivingly is who she is.

45:31.428 --> 45:32.529
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

45:32.596 --> 45:34.398
- To our circus.
- I agree.

45:34.465 --> 45:36.200
- Yeah.
- Cheers again to that.

45:36.266 --> 45:37.701
Double cheers.

45:37.768 --> 45:40.571
It's really, really, really,
really, really fun.

45:40.637 --> 45:43.006
Are you happy you came
on this date with me?

45:43.073 --> 45:45.476
Absolutely. Why did you
pick me for the date?

45:45.542 --> 45:47.544
- You're super handsome.
- Thank you.

45:47.611 --> 45:48.746
You have lovely lips
and nice teeth.

45:48.812 --> 45:50.314
Lovely lips? I haven't- I
haven't gotten that one yet.

45:50.380 --> 45:51.648
I like teeth a lot.

45:51.715 --> 45:53.450
Well, you have
great teeth as well.

45:53.517 --> 45:55.619
- And seemingly great lips.
- Thanks.

45:55.686 --> 45:56.653
But we'll have to find out
at some point.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.089
Do you want to check?

45:59.156 --> 46:01.024
Let's check.

46:08.265 --> 46:11.068
Ah, yeah...

46:11.135 --> 46:12.636
Well...

46:14.238 --> 46:16.373
How are my lips?

46:16.440 --> 46:19.643
I'm still undecided about that
kiss, to be honest, yeah.

46:19.710 --> 46:20.711
- Okay.
-

46:20.777 --> 46:22.579
- Very soft, very tender.
- Take pride in them.

46:22.646 --> 46:23.814
Wow.

46:23.881 --> 46:26.517
If a girl comes in and asks you
on a date, are you gonna go?

46:26.583 --> 46:29.319
Well, I mean, I was with Lisa
and I went on a date with you.

46:29.386 --> 46:32.055
So, you guys were like a thing?
- Kind of are a thing.

46:32.122 --> 46:33.557
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it's been amazing.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.593
We all know in Paradise one
date can mean a lot.

46:36.660 --> 46:38.495
But, a couple days
means a lot too and

46:38.562 --> 46:40.464
I've spent quite a bit of
time with Lisa.

46:40.531 --> 46:43.400
So, when we go back there, are
you gonna make out with her?

46:43.467 --> 46:44.701
Ah, for- Well-

46:44.768 --> 46:46.637
You can't.
I'll be pissed.

46:46.703 --> 46:47.871
Wow, okay.

46:47.938 --> 46:51.375
I hope he can clear whatever he
has with someone else, off.

46:51.441 --> 46:54.378
And we can get this going.

46:54.444 --> 46:56.780
If you make out with her, I'll
throw you in the lake.

46:56.847 --> 46:58.148
Damn.

46:58.215 --> 46:59.783
Iva's a, "my way or the
highway girl."

46:59.850 --> 47:02.152
And, she's made it very
clear that if I have another

47:02.219 --> 47:04.855
connection here, it's her or
the other connection.

47:04.922 --> 47:06.356
I can't just break things
off with her.

47:06.423 --> 47:07.324
Why not?

47:07.391 --> 47:09.726
Actually, no, it's more like
it's just her.

47:09.793 --> 47:11.795
And there's no choice.

47:11.862 --> 47:14.598
Well, I hope you tell her this
date went great and you're done.

47:27.778 --> 47:30.347
I'm waiting for Brendan M.
on this date,

47:30.414 --> 47:34.551
but waiting around makes me
a little bit anxious.

47:34.618 --> 47:38.455
It makes me feel like he's
gonna not show up.

47:38.522 --> 47:44.127
My first day in Paradise and I'm
gonna get stood up on a date.

47:52.202 --> 47:53.370
I'm getting ready
for this date,

47:53.437 --> 47:55.606
looking forward to it and,
come to find out

47:55.672 --> 47:57.841
Angela wants to have a
little conversation.

47:57.908 --> 47:59.409
It's kind of disheartening.

47:59.476 --> 48:02.179
We spoke about giving each
other the freedom to...

48:02.246 --> 48:03.580
pursue different
connections so,

48:03.647 --> 48:05.649
I thought that that was
still an option.

48:07.384 --> 48:10.754
But, obviously, it wasn't.

48:10.821 --> 48:14.524
- What's up?
- What's going on?

48:14.591 --> 48:16.660
What's going
through your mind?

48:16.727 --> 48:20.464
Things had a-

48:20.530 --> 48:24.501
I don't know. I think I
just felt like...

48:24.568 --> 48:27.471
I don't know.
Caught off guard, slightly.

48:27.537 --> 48:31.775
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:31.842 --> 48:36.179
I don't want you to feel as
though me accepting this date

48:36.246 --> 48:38.248
takes away from any
kind of, you know,

48:38.315 --> 48:40.217
connection that
I have with you.

48:41.852 --> 48:44.788
If you wanted to say no then
you would have, you know.

48:44.855 --> 48:48.392
- Mhm.
- So, that's...

48:51.828 --> 48:56.733
I really want you to just
focus on what we have.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.770
And, if it had been,
you know,

48:59.836 --> 49:01.605
the opposite,
I would have...

49:01.672 --> 49:03.340
given you the same respect,
you know.

49:03.407 --> 49:04.541
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:04.608 --> 49:07.711
I'm not disrespecting you.
It just caught-

49:07.778 --> 49:12.716
I just didn't think you
would say yes, so...

49:12.783 --> 49:13.917
Like, I know we had
talked about it,

49:13.984 --> 49:17.988
but that was like- It just
seemed like a while ago and

49:18.055 --> 49:20.891
then just like the last couple
days I just felt like-

49:20.958 --> 49:23.393
we kind of like levelled up,
you know?

49:23.460 --> 49:24.861
Mhm.

49:33.003 --> 49:35.272
Like, I'm not gonna tell you,
like, not to go, you know.

49:35.339 --> 49:38.375
I just feel like an idiot,
kind of.

49:47.918 --> 49:52.255
Do you not-
do you not get it?

49:52.322 --> 49:54.458
I want you to be able to
like communicate with me,

49:54.524 --> 49:56.259
you know, about how
you're feeling. I don't-

49:56.326 --> 49:58.962
I didn't get a chance to.
You just walked away.

49:59.029 --> 50:00.764
That's fair.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.481
I just didn't think today
was gonna go like this.

50:17.547 --> 50:20.617
- I just-
- I didn't either.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.285
So, I'll chat
with you later?

50:22.352 --> 50:24.521
- Yeah.
- Okay.

50:24.588 --> 50:26.623
I just feel dumb.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.492
I just feel like every time I
start to trust somebody,

50:28.558 --> 50:31.294
I just get...

50:31.361 --> 50:33.030
It just like blows up
in my face.

50:33.096 --> 50:35.065
Like, I just was like,
Paradise I thought was

50:35.132 --> 50:37.300
really starting
to work for me.

50:41.605 --> 50:44.408
When they say it's too good to
be true, it normally is.

50:54.484 --> 50:56.520
So, I'm waiting
and I'm waiting.

50:56.586 --> 50:59.723
And Brendan M.
finally shows up.

50:59.790 --> 51:01.391
- What's up?
- Hi.

51:01.458 --> 51:02.859
-
- Welcome.

51:02.926 --> 51:06.029
I'm super excited to see him,
and I can't wait to

51:06.096 --> 51:08.932
get to know Brendan M.
a little bit more.

51:08.999 --> 51:10.934
- Okay.
- What've got here?

51:11.001 --> 51:13.103
We're gonna make a painting.

51:13.170 --> 51:14.704
Do you want to get
more comfortable?

51:14.771 --> 51:16.873
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Alright.

51:18.475 --> 51:20.644
Brendan M. is a very
attractive man.

51:20.710 --> 51:24.514
Obviously, looking at him...

51:24.581 --> 51:26.917
it was nice.

51:26.983 --> 51:28.552
- Oh, wow.
- I know.

51:30.086 --> 51:32.055
We actually had some
interesting outfits

51:32.122 --> 51:33.890
to go along with it, so...

51:34.891 --> 51:37.027
Maria looks fantastic in
her bathing suit.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.295
Yeah, she...

51:38.361 --> 51:41.798
she's a really beautiful girl
and, yeah, she has a great body.

51:41.865 --> 51:44.835
Alright, let's
get to it then.

51:44.901 --> 51:49.106
I've never done anything
like this before in my life.

51:49.172 --> 51:51.541
I've never made
art half naked.

51:51.608 --> 51:52.909
Okay.

51:52.976 --> 51:55.045
I figured that was coming.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.913
I'm having a lot of
fun with Maria.

51:56.980 --> 52:00.517
You know, my mind was kind of
moving at 100 miles per hour

52:00.584 --> 52:02.018
when I was talking
with Angela and,

52:02.085 --> 52:04.955
just being here on this date,
it's just helping me just relax

52:05.021 --> 52:06.823
and, you know,
just enjoy myself.

52:06.890 --> 52:08.992
You know, you gotta be
expressive about it, right?

52:09.059 --> 52:10.660
It's beautiful. Hey!

52:10.727 --> 52:12.696
When we get a little bit
more into it...

52:16.600 --> 52:17.667
Like that, you know?

52:17.734 --> 52:19.002
And remember,
I'm an artist so...

52:19.069 --> 52:20.704
So, I'm the canvas?

52:20.770 --> 52:21.538
Yeah.

52:21.638 --> 52:24.141
Things start to get
a little messy.

52:24.207 --> 52:26.643
I didn't mean to
get your face.

52:28.612 --> 52:30.514
Oh, I'm so-
I didn't-

52:30.580 --> 52:32.649
I was trying to
get it there.

52:32.716 --> 52:35.118
Okay. Only because I
got it in your mouth.

52:35.185 --> 52:36.453
Yeah, I just needed
a little something.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.454
There.

52:37.521 --> 52:38.755
It feels nice to be painted on.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.824
You know, Maria's getting
in there and...

52:40.891 --> 52:43.059
it was really, really fun
to get hands on.

52:43.126 --> 52:44.694
♪ HEY BABY.

52:46.029 --> 52:48.498
We start painting each
other's bodies and,

52:48.565 --> 52:51.668
I am usually not really a
touchy-feely person

52:51.735 --> 52:53.436
on a first date.

52:53.503 --> 52:56.640
But, there is a first
for everything.

52:56.706 --> 53:00.043
There's like a nice
little stencil there.

53:00.110 --> 53:02.879
There you go, there you go.
Get it all on you, yeah, yeah.

53:02.946 --> 53:04.948
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- It's all over my butt too.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.082
Beautiful.

53:06.149 --> 53:08.118
I'm really enjoying my
time with Maria.

53:08.184 --> 53:11.655
Conversation is just easy.
She's super interesting.

53:11.721 --> 53:15.625
Really smart.
And, easy on the eyes.

53:15.692 --> 53:18.929
So far, the date is great,
and I am very excited to

53:18.995 --> 53:20.931
get to know him a
little bit more.

53:20.997 --> 53:23.967
Looks like Paradise.
A big mess.

53:24.034 --> 53:26.670
Is that what it is? No!

53:26.736 --> 53:28.171
Yes, that's what it is.

53:34.244 --> 53:36.513
We're back and I want to
say hi to everyone.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.748
You can talk to your
current connections.

53:38.815 --> 53:40.684
Tell them how much you
like this new girl.

53:40.750 --> 53:42.752
-
- Well, hello, hello!

53:42.819 --> 53:45.155
- Oh, hey, guys!
- Hello!

53:45.222 --> 53:48.158
- Welcome back.
- How was the trapezing?

53:48.224 --> 53:50.794
- Is that what you guys did?
- Yeah, we went trapezing.

53:50.860 --> 53:53.163
Did you show him up?
Like, how was that?

53:53.230 --> 53:54.497
We both did good.

53:54.564 --> 53:56.032
I feel like we trapezed
at the same...

53:56.099 --> 53:58.101
Yeah, same level?

53:58.168 --> 54:01.104
She was making it look
"trap-easy".

54:01.171 --> 54:03.640
-
- I'm done.

54:03.707 --> 54:06.076
-
- Was it on like a harness?

54:06.142 --> 54:08.244
- Did you kiss?
-

54:08.311 --> 54:09.646
That's my question.

54:09.713 --> 54:11.848
That's a very
personal question.

54:11.915 --> 54:13.984
- Oh, okay, she took a sip.
- Okay, let's go talk.

54:14.050 --> 54:15.285
I don't want this
pressure anymore.

54:15.352 --> 54:17.153
I think they did.
She took a sip.

54:17.220 --> 54:20.156
That was interesting.

54:20.223 --> 54:22.259
I am not shocked at all
that people keep

54:22.325 --> 54:24.194
pulling Josh for dates.
He seems to be one of

54:24.260 --> 54:26.763
the only guys that's making
the effort to be friendly.

54:26.830 --> 54:28.765
Honestly, it makes him
more attractive.

54:28.832 --> 54:30.634
- How are you?
- Good.

54:30.700 --> 54:32.702
Ah, you guys were gone
for a really long time.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.904
Yeah, so, I'm just gonna give
you the full download right now.

54:34.971 --> 54:36.806
She's really nice,
like really cool.

54:36.873 --> 54:38.541
But like,
super high energy.

54:38.608 --> 54:40.777
Oh, like higher
energy than me?

54:40.844 --> 54:42.746
Way, way, way higher
energy than you.

54:42.812 --> 54:45.248
- How does that happen?
- Yeah, she's really nice, yeah.

54:45.315 --> 54:46.950
But is she? Are we gonna
have a problem?

54:47.017 --> 54:47.851
Did you say anything about me?

54:47.917 --> 54:49.185
Oh, she's like, "Oh,
are you gonna like

54:49.252 --> 54:51.821
break things off with Lisa?"

54:51.888 --> 54:54.124
Girl, what?

54:54.190 --> 54:56.760
No. No, no, no.

54:56.826 --> 54:59.929
Ah, after one conversation?

54:59.996 --> 55:02.832
I know, and I was like trying
to explain- well, you know,

55:02.899 --> 55:05.935
we've been like talking for a
while and it's not so easy.

55:06.002 --> 55:07.937
That's actually so blunt
to just be like,

55:08.004 --> 55:12.976
"Well, are you gonna be
done with that?" No...

55:13.043 --> 55:15.178
Does that mean me and her are
gonna have a problem?

55:17.313 --> 55:18.448
- I mean...
-

55:18.515 --> 55:22.352
I am the last person somebody
wants a problem with, oof.

55:22.419 --> 55:25.855
- I'm small, but I'm mighty.
- Oh, man, okay.

55:25.922 --> 55:27.891
Josh is always getting pulled
left, right, and centre

55:27.957 --> 55:29.726
by all of these
other ladies.

55:29.793 --> 55:31.828
But, I don't like when
another girl thinks

55:31.895 --> 55:34.264
she's vibing with my man.

55:34.331 --> 55:37.701
I mean, we'll see, like,
how the rest of the night goes.

55:39.769 --> 55:41.204
<i>Coming up...</i>

55:43.740 --> 55:44.974
Do you know when you cheers
you're supposed to

55:45.041 --> 55:46.710
look at the person
straight in the eye?

55:46.776 --> 55:47.677
Really?
Okay, I did a terrible job.

55:47.744 --> 55:49.079
Or else it's 7
years bad sex.

55:49.145 --> 55:50.280
Okay, let's do it again.

55:50.347 --> 55:51.781
I just feel stupid.

55:51.848 --> 55:53.149
I don't know if
I can trust him.

55:53.216 --> 55:54.351
- Cheers?
- Cheers!

55:54.417 --> 55:55.151
Cheers.

55:55.251 --> 55:58.955
Today hurt me, bad.
Did they kiss?

55:59.022 --> 56:00.256
I'm in a weird position.
I really want to kiss you.

56:00.323 --> 56:01.358
I know.

56:01.424 --> 56:03.993
Is he now interested in her?

56:04.060 --> 56:06.796
Ange's brain is running
a mile a minute.

56:06.863 --> 56:09.165
Did he have fun?

56:09.232 --> 56:13.069
I need to talk to
Brendan M. right away.

56:20.844 --> 56:22.045
So, you had fun on
the date, huh?

56:22.112 --> 56:24.314
- I had a lot of fun.
- Okay, I'm glad.

56:24.380 --> 56:26.716
And you're an artist.
I picked the right person.

56:26.783 --> 56:28.985
Ah, I mean, I'm not quite as
good as you, but...

56:29.052 --> 56:30.887
-
- You know, I'm working on it.

56:30.954 --> 56:34.023
The second part of the date,
it's super cozy.

56:34.090 --> 56:36.760
And, Brendan M. looks great.

56:36.826 --> 56:39.996
The activity part of it
was fine, and it was great.

56:40.063 --> 56:43.032
But I am super excited to sit
down and talk to him.

56:43.099 --> 56:45.101
Why did you pick me to go
on a date with you?

56:45.168 --> 56:47.270
Honestly, we had the
best conversation.

56:47.337 --> 56:49.806
- That makes sense, I like that.
- It just like felt comfortable.

56:49.873 --> 56:52.108
I'm really enjoying my time
with Maria.

56:52.175 --> 56:54.244
She has a really calming
energy about her.

56:54.310 --> 56:56.045
You know, very beautiful.

56:56.112 --> 56:58.014
We're diving a little bit
deeper here so, yeah,

56:58.081 --> 56:59.349
the conversation's great.

56:59.416 --> 57:02.685
Brendan M. makes me feel
super comfortable.

57:02.752 --> 57:05.955
He is open and he's
welcoming and nice.

57:06.022 --> 57:07.390
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

57:07.457 --> 57:09.793
- Cheers to a good date and-
- Fun time in Paradise.

57:09.859 --> 57:11.828
- Fun time in Paradise, okay.
- Yeah.

57:13.263 --> 57:14.898
Do you know when you cheers
you're supposed to

57:14.964 --> 57:16.266
look at the person
straight in the eye?

57:16.332 --> 57:17.434
Really? Okay,
I did a terrible job.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.903
Or else it's
7 years OF bad sex.

57:19.969 --> 57:21.204
That's what Colombians say.

57:21.271 --> 57:23.840
Okay, let's do it again.

57:25.475 --> 57:27.944
So, what is it, 7 years of
good sex now?

57:28.011 --> 57:29.445
I don't know.

57:31.481 --> 57:33.716
- You're really fun.
- So are you.

57:33.783 --> 57:35.885
Yeah, I'm really happy that
you went on this date with me.

57:35.952 --> 57:39.756
I'm happy that you, you
asked me to.

57:39.823 --> 57:41.257
I'm in a weird position.
I really want to kiss you.

57:41.324 --> 57:44.427
- I know.
-

57:44.494 --> 57:49.098
But like, I mean, you obviously
know that I have like-

57:49.165 --> 57:50.934
- Yeah, I get it.
- Different connections.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.235
I get it.

57:52.302 --> 57:54.337
As much as I would
love to kiss Maria,

57:54.404 --> 57:57.040
I have this strong connection
with Angela and I,

57:57.106 --> 57:59.242
I don't want to do
anything that would be

57:59.309 --> 58:00.977
disrespectful in any way.

58:01.044 --> 58:05.215
Usually, back at home, I do not
kiss people on a first date.

58:05.281 --> 58:08.918
So, the fact that Brendan and
I didn't kiss, it's okay.

58:08.985 --> 58:10.186
- We'll have more time.
- Okay.

58:10.253 --> 58:11.354
- Yeah.
- Can I get a hug?

58:11.421 --> 58:14.791
And you can figure out.
Of course.

58:14.858 --> 58:17.861
Excellent.

58:17.927 --> 58:19.395
- Cheers to that, I guess.
- Cheers.

58:19.462 --> 58:22.765
My experience on my first
date in Paradise is

58:22.832 --> 58:25.134
a lot better than
what I expected.

58:25.201 --> 58:27.937
I'm glad that we can,
we can do this and...

58:28.004 --> 58:29.372
It's actually been really
nice talking to you.

58:29.439 --> 58:30.406
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:30.473 --> 58:32.509
Good, I'm happy.

58:32.575 --> 58:34.444
I'm happy that you've
had a good time ́cause

58:34.510 --> 58:37.146
I, I really have. I really have
had a great time with you.

58:37.213 --> 58:38.982
Me too.

58:41.584 --> 58:44.020
- How are you?
- Struggling.

58:47.123 --> 58:50.059
Angela seems to be keeping
her composure, but I-

58:50.126 --> 58:52.195
I know that her heart
is breaking.

58:52.262 --> 58:55.231
I think any girl would be
upset in this moment.

58:55.298 --> 58:58.067
I was just like so caught
off guard, obviously.

58:58.134 --> 59:00.770
He came to the door,
we talked for like literally

59:00.837 --> 59:03.506
three minutes and he
basically just said,

59:03.573 --> 59:06.209
by him going on this date,
that doesn't change or

59:06.276 --> 59:08.278
take away anything that
him and I have.

59:08.344 --> 59:09.846
I didn't get to be like,
"Hey, like,

59:09.913 --> 59:11.481
you hurt my feelings,"
like, you know.

59:11.547 --> 59:13.249
He was like, "I wish you
would have told me you

59:13.316 --> 59:16.519
didn't want to like not go
on dates." And I was like,

59:16.586 --> 59:19.155
"Well, you didn't even
like talk to me.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.557
You literally just said yes to
the date and walked away."

59:21.624 --> 59:24.894
I don't think the problem
was Brendan M.

59:24.961 --> 59:27.297
taking Maria on a date.

59:27.363 --> 59:31.901
I think it was the lack of
communication before the date.

59:31.968 --> 59:34.971
I think she felt a little
blindsides and so,

59:35.038 --> 59:37.273
that's of course gonna
make her mind

59:37.340 --> 59:39.008
run a million
miles a minute.

59:39.075 --> 59:40.310
I just feel stupid.

59:40.376 --> 59:41.878
Especially after the
conversations that

59:41.945 --> 59:43.379
you guys have had
in recent days.

59:43.446 --> 59:45.882
It goes without saying that,
you know,

59:45.949 --> 59:46.816
we're not gonna
go on dates-

59:46.883 --> 59:49.519
- Maybe don't go on dates.
- Yeah, yeah.

59:49.585 --> 59:51.554
If the situation was reversed,
I was like,

59:51.621 --> 59:54.490
"Would you not feel the same
way that I am," or whatever.

59:54.557 --> 59:56.592
And he was just like, "No".

59:56.659 --> 59:58.528
In the moment, like,
if I was in her shoes,

1:00:00.430 --> 1:00:02.365
I feel really stupid.

1:00:04.634 --> 1:00:08.438
- Don't feel dumb.
- I just feel stupid.

1:00:08.504 --> 1:00:10.873
Like, you just...

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.976
you know, have such
a good thing going.

1:00:13.042 --> 1:00:14.510
You know, we were just
talking about like

1:00:14.577 --> 1:00:16.245
how it just felt
like real life.

1:00:16.312 --> 1:00:19.415
- I'm just exhausted right now.
- I know you are.

1:00:19.482 --> 1:00:22.585
I was fricking pissed at
Brendan M. I don't understand

1:00:22.652 --> 1:00:26.356
what's going on in this man's
head and what he's thinking.

1:00:26.422 --> 1:00:27.590
I don't know.
I just feel like

1:00:27.657 --> 1:00:30.126
I don't know if I can trust
him completely.

1:00:30.193 --> 1:00:31.394
What if he kisses her?

1:00:31.461 --> 1:00:32.595
Well, you know,
it's my life.

1:00:32.662 --> 1:00:34.964
I'm sure,
sure there'll be a kiss.

1:00:35.031 --> 1:00:36.599
Let's just throw a
wrench in there.

1:00:36.666 --> 1:00:40.269
Shit, Ange is such a great girl.
Like, don't screw this up.

1:00:40.336 --> 1:00:43.006
I'm just sad because like
I felt like Paradise

1:00:43.072 --> 1:00:45.141
is actually working,
you know. And...

1:00:46.309 --> 1:00:48.378
I don't know, like, part of
me just wonders like...

1:00:59.055 --> 1:01:02.458
-
- Ange...

1:01:02.525 --> 1:01:04.193
It's always me, you guys.

1:01:04.260 --> 1:01:07.930
At this point, I can only
imagine that Ange's brain is

1:01:07.997 --> 1:01:09.999
running a mile a minute
thinking about what

1:01:10.066 --> 1:01:12.969
Maria and Brendan might be
doing on their date.

1:01:13.036 --> 1:01:16.005
I'm just waiting for him
to get back here.

1:01:16.072 --> 1:01:18.107
Today hurt me, bad.

1:01:18.174 --> 1:01:20.343
I've been in my head
all day and that's not,

1:01:20.410 --> 1:01:23.946
that's not typical for me.
Did they kiss?

1:01:24.013 --> 1:01:28.618
Did he have fun?
Is he now interested in her?

1:01:28.684 --> 1:01:31.521
I need to talk to Brendan M.
right away.

1:01:31.587 --> 1:01:33.222
Oh, shoot,
here's all the guys.

1:01:33.289 --> 1:01:35.591
Everyone's hanging out.

1:01:35.658 --> 1:01:37.326
It's nice that Angela has,
you know,

1:01:37.393 --> 1:01:39.962
this group of girls
who she can talk to,

1:01:40.029 --> 1:01:41.431
and she has a strong
connection with.

1:01:41.497 --> 1:01:44.701
But at the same time,
I don't know if it's-

1:01:44.767 --> 1:01:46.369
benefits our relationship.

1:01:46.436 --> 1:01:47.937
- He's back, Ange.
- It's always one of us.

1:01:52.508 --> 1:01:55.044
- It's our date couple!
- Hey, what's up, guys?

1:01:55.111 --> 1:01:56.946
- Hi, guys.
- How you guys doing?

1:01:57.013 --> 1:01:59.082
- Welcome!
- Nice to meet you.

1:01:59.148 --> 1:02:00.416
- How was your date?
- It was good.

1:02:00.483 --> 1:02:01.617
- It was nice, yeah.
- Yeah.

1:02:01.684 --> 1:02:04.087
- What did you guys do?
- Oh, my gosh.

1:02:04.153 --> 1:02:06.422
- Did you do a mud fight?
- No, not quite.

1:02:06.489 --> 1:02:08.624
- Body painting art.
- No!

1:02:08.691 --> 1:02:10.726
Yeah, it was like all white.
And then we like-

1:02:10.793 --> 1:02:12.995
I had like a white bikini
and we just-

1:02:13.062 --> 1:02:15.531
- We rolled around.
- Yeah, it was fun.

1:02:15.598 --> 1:02:17.500
I heard them say something
about body paint.

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:20.103
- Body paint?
- Did you kiss?

1:02:20.169 --> 1:02:22.238
-
- They asked me!

1:02:22.305 --> 1:02:25.041
- Ah, oh, that's kind of-
- Did you kiss?

1:02:25.108 --> 1:02:27.210
Take a sip, yeah. That usually
determines something.

1:02:27.276 --> 1:02:30.346
- They kissed.
- Who knows.

1:02:30.413 --> 1:02:32.482
The first thing that I hear
from somebody is,

1:02:32.548 --> 1:02:34.083
"Did you guys kiss?"

1:02:34.150 --> 1:02:36.085
I'm getting that
they kissed.

1:02:36.152 --> 1:02:37.253
Alright, let's go
make our rounds.

1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:38.688
- How about that?
- Yeah.

1:02:38.755 --> 1:02:40.356
We'll check you guys later,
alright?

1:02:44.093 --> 1:02:45.595
Oh, these guys.

1:02:45.661 --> 1:02:47.296
Oh, you already
know these folks.

1:02:47.363 --> 1:02:49.398
Probably not the best
group to say hi to.

1:02:51.834 --> 1:02:53.202
Do you want to go to the
beach or somewhere?

1:02:53.269 --> 1:02:55.238
- Mhm.
- Alright, come.

1:02:55.304 --> 1:02:57.006
- Show me around.
- Alright.

1:02:57.073 --> 1:02:59.742
- What are we looking at?
- Hm, them walking away.

1:02:59.809 --> 1:03:01.244
- Both of them?
- Yeah.

1:03:01.310 --> 1:03:02.378
Okay.

1:03:02.445 --> 1:03:06.549
When I had made my way over
to Angela and, you know,

1:03:06.616 --> 1:03:09.585
everyone else, it wasn't, you
know a pleasant place to be so,

1:03:09.652 --> 1:03:12.455
I felt that it was best if I
just removed Maria and myself

1:03:12.522 --> 1:03:14.090
from that space.

1:03:14.157 --> 1:03:16.592
Yeah, I had a weird day today.

1:03:16.659 --> 1:03:18.561
Huh.

1:03:18.628 --> 1:03:21.230
Am I just invisible
today? Like...

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:27.436
That whole scenario could've
been handled a lot better.

1:03:27.503 --> 1:03:30.306
The fact that they made eye
contact with us and then

1:03:30.373 --> 1:03:32.141
decided to walk a
different direction...

1:03:32.208 --> 1:03:33.643
It would be one thing if
he didn't even know

1:03:33.709 --> 1:03:34.577
that you were sitting here.

1:03:34.644 --> 1:03:37.780
But like, straight up
made eye contact.

1:03:37.847 --> 1:03:41.818
Where did they go?

1:03:41.884 --> 1:03:43.653
I don't know, you guys.

1:03:43.719 --> 1:03:46.155
What the hell is he doing?

1:03:46.222 --> 1:03:48.257
It's super awkward.

1:03:48.324 --> 1:03:49.692
Did this just ruin us?

1:03:49.759 --> 1:03:51.761
Great times.

1:03:51.827 --> 1:03:53.763
Another day in Paradise.

1:03:59.435 --> 1:04:03.472
<i>Coming up next time, on
Bachelor in Paradise Canada...</i>

1:04:03.539 --> 1:04:07.276
The first ever Camp Paradise
Twisted Talent Show.

1:04:07.343 --> 1:04:08.544
Either I'm gonna realize
we have some

1:04:08.611 --> 1:04:10.213
very talented people here...

1:04:11.714 --> 1:04:14.083
Or cringe fest 2021.

1:04:14.150 --> 1:04:17.787
How does it feel to be Vay's
second pick after me?

1:04:17.853 --> 1:04:20.690
Oh!

1:04:20.756 --> 1:04:23.259
Iva is coming in hot.

1:04:23.326 --> 1:04:25.461
I like you.
I don't like any other guys.

1:04:25.528 --> 1:04:28.264
- I think you are smoking hot.
- Thank you.

1:04:28.331 --> 1:04:30.366
This is honestly the only
connection I have had.

1:04:30.433 --> 1:04:33.769
Are we gonna kiss to see
if we combine?

1:04:33.836 --> 1:04:36.172
I was upset to see you
like walk away

1:04:36.239 --> 1:04:37.473
hand in hand with
another girl.

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:39.208
I think it's only right for
me to, you know,

1:04:39.275 --> 1:04:40.309
pursue other options.

1:04:40.376 --> 1:04:41.811
If I can't trust you,
then I'm out.

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:43.679
If you want to get to
know me, like, I'm here.

1:04:43.746 --> 1:04:45.114
Love to get to know you.

1:04:45.181 --> 1:04:49.218
I'm upset that I wasted
my date card.

1:04:49.285 --> 1:04:52.388
I really want to go home.
This is so dumb.

1:04:55.524 --> 1:04:56.826
No matter what I do tonight,

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:59.695
a lot of people are
gonna get hurt.

1:04:59.762 --> 1:05:01.464
Maria.

1:05:01.530 --> 1:05:03.666
Don't keep mentioning
the same girl.

1:05:03.733 --> 1:05:04.867
It makes me feel like shit.

1:05:04.934 --> 1:05:07.169
He's definitely
prioritizing Maria.

1:05:07.236 --> 1:05:09.171
I just don't like
repeating myself.

1:05:09.238 --> 1:05:11.774
I just want to know where
your priority's at. Pick.

1:05:11.841 --> 1:05:14.777
If I am wrong, put me in
my place right now.

1:05:14.844 --> 1:05:16.779
I don't even
know what to say.

1:05:16.846 --> 1:05:18.748
Cluster

1:05:20.916 --> 1:05:22.451
What?
That's a raccoon!

1:05:22.518 --> 1:05:25.254
Oh, my God, okay.
Do we panic?

1:05:28.324 --> 1:05:29.292
Did you hear that?

1:05:29.358 --> 1:05:31.227
What was it?

1:05:31.294 --> 1:05:33.396
Sounded like a raccoon.

1:05:33.462 --> 1:05:37.199
Do we panic? There's a
raccoon right there.

1:05:37.266 --> 1:05:39.602
Okay, sorry.
Bloopers.

1:05:39.669 --> 1:05:41.504
Um... ha-ha!

1:05:41.570 --> 1:05:42.738
Oh, it's kind of cute!

1:05:42.805 --> 1:05:44.407
I know, but he's like,
"Alright, I'm out".

1:05:44.473 --> 1:05:45.541
He's like, "Bye".

1:05:45.608 --> 1:05:49.478
- I love that so-
-

1:05:49.545 --> 1:05:50.746
It's, it's a raccoon.

1:05:50.813 --> 1:05:52.548
He can't handle
the girl talk.

1:05:52.615 --> 1:05:54.951
- Aren't they vicious?
- Yeah.

1:05:55.017 --> 1:05:57.486
His little feet.

1:05:57.553 --> 1:06:00.156
The raccoon is coming
to check on me.
