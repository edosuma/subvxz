[sighing] Yeah, me and Jen,
we're heading back now.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.875
We'll see you back
in the office.

[Karl sighing]

03:38.958 --> 03:40.416
Nothing they can do till Monday.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.625
They said they'll send somebody
over first thing, though.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.791
Hey, it's out of our hands.

03:52.833 --> 03:53.708
I don't envy them.

03:55.708 --> 03:56.625

Child Services.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.333
Yeah.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.666
[Karl] It's a bit
close to the weekend

04:03.708 --> 04:05.500
to be starting
another one, isn't it?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.541
Oh, it's okay.

04:08.583 --> 04:09.916
I'll drop you off on the way.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.875
This is just one I
was worried about.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.458
You don't need to come.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.208
Like you said, it's
almost the weekend.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.083
Fair enough.

04:23.333 --> 04:24.916
Can we stop at a shop somewhere?

04:24.958 --> 04:27.708
[somber music]

04:39.625 --> 04:40.666
You want anything?

No.

[Radio News Host] The body

has been identified as missing

Mathews was reported
missing last October.

may have information.

[Karl] Bit early.

05:48.875 --> 05:49.875
What?

05:50.833 --> 05:51.875
Trick or treaters.

05:53.791 --> 05:55.333
Oh, um, yeah.

06:11.083 --> 06:12.708
You got any plans for tomorrow?

06:14.250 --> 06:16.208
You got a big party to go to?

06:16.250 --> 06:17.041
Nope.

06:18.666 --> 06:19.708
Shame.

06:21.750 --> 06:25.458
I could see you as
a witch. [laughing]

06:25.500 --> 06:26.291
Thanks.

06:31.041 --> 06:34.000
-Talking of a bit early.
-What?

06:34.041 --> 06:34.833
Nothing.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Just 'cause you can't have one

06:37.041 --> 06:38.166
without going off the deep end,

06:38.208 --> 06:39.708
doesn't mean it's wrong
for the rest of us

06:39.750 --> 06:42.000
to have a couple of quiet cans
after a day in the trenches.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.291
I didn't say anything.

06:43.333 --> 06:44.708
Yes, you did.

06:45.833 --> 06:47.291
And I know that look as well.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.583
I've been on the receiving
end of that one enough.

06:53.375 --> 06:55.000
Besides, it's
nearly the weekend.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.666
It's not like I'm
drinking on the job.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.166
Yeah, like that's
never happened.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.625
Oh, come on.

07:01.666 --> 07:02.916
That's not the same.

07:02.958 --> 07:04.916
What's wrong with
a pint at lunch?

07:06.250 --> 07:11.166
It's not like you never
did...back in the day.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.583
Well, I'm lucky to get a
lunch break these days, Karl.

07:14.916 --> 07:16.166
Maybe you should try

07:16.208 --> 07:17.708
and get out and enjoy
yourself a bit more.

07:18.708 --> 07:21.083
I do, from time to time.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.083
The last time you were out,

07:22.125 --> 07:23.625
Michael Jackson was still black.

07:25.416 --> 07:26.666
Well, he was alive at least.

07:33.708 --> 07:35.541
So what's wrong
with your laptop?

07:36.958 --> 07:38.041
You going old school?

07:39.666 --> 07:40.333
It's an old case.

07:41.541 --> 07:42.666
Yeah, what's the story
with this one then?

07:45.458 --> 07:46.750
David Peirce.

07:49.291 --> 07:50.500
Jesus Christ.

07:52.333 --> 07:55.250
Just out of the nut
house for murder.

He lives in the
middle of nowhere.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.750
[somber music]

08:03.291 --> 08:05.416
What are doing going out
there last thing on a Friday?

08:05.458 --> 08:07.500
He's been evaluated,
he's harmless.

08:08.708 --> 08:10.041
Besides, he's not
answering his phone.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.250
I'm worried something
might have happened to him.

08:12.291 --> 08:17.916
Ha, you're worried
about him. [sighing]

08:17.958 --> 08:20.458
Jesus, it was a little girl
he went down for murdering.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.625
He was a kid himself, Karl.

08:22.666 --> 08:25.791
It was a long time ago, people
change, you've seen that.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.916
Aye, I have, rarely
for the better, though.

08:34.416 --> 08:35.666
Did you ever think
that you might be

08:35.707 --> 08:36.791
in the wrong line of work?

08:38.207 --> 08:39.375
What do you mean?

08:39.416 --> 08:42.332
It's good pay, nine
to five, pension?

08:42.375 --> 08:44.708
I mean, don't you care about
the people we're helping?

08:45.708 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, of course.

08:51.500 --> 08:55.666
That kid back there,
I mean, the poor baby.

08:55.708 --> 08:56.791
How could I not?

08:57.791 --> 08:59.416
This is different.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.083
Well, everyone needs help, Karl.

09:04.166 --> 09:08.750
All right, I see what
you're getting at.

09:09.791 --> 09:10.666
Fine, I'll come.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.500
No, I wasn't getting at that.

09:13.541 --> 09:15.708
-You don't need to.
-No, no.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.791
It's not like I had a big
night out planned or anything,

09:17.833 --> 09:20.416
and...like you said,

09:21.583 --> 09:23.708
maybe I should care more
about these nutters.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.500
-Karl, I wasn't--
-No, no.

09:25.541 --> 09:27.666
I won't have you
besmirching my good name.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.666
Besides, if anything
were to happen to you,

09:32.708 --> 09:34.000
it would be muggins here

09:34.041 --> 09:35.291
that would be stuck
with your caseload.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.625
Okay, fine.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.791
Just don't moan about the drive.

09:44.833 --> 09:45.916
Me?

09:45.958 --> 09:47.416
I wouldn't dream of it.

I've been up this way.

10:30.416 --> 10:31.666
Boring.

10:33.791 --> 10:35.375
I bet stinks as well.

10:35.416 --> 10:39.666
You know, farms, cow shit
everywhere, not for me.

10:48.375 --> 10:49.125
Is this it?

10:51.875 --> 10:53.541
Where have you brought me?

10:53.583 --> 10:55.250
I thought you weren't
going to moan.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.666
Mm, it is pretty quiet.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.791
It's like a bloody ghost town.

given up the ghost.

[Imitating sat nav]
In 200 meters,

11:17.208 --> 11:20.375
you will reach the
Twilight Zone. [chuckles]

11:26.791 --> 11:27.750
Back again.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.416
Maybe we should ask someone.

11:34.583 --> 11:35.666
Yeah.

11:35.708 --> 11:36.583
Who exactly?

11:37.833 --> 11:39.000
-There.
-Where?

11:43.750 --> 11:45.250
I thought I saw someone.

11:46.666 --> 11:48.500
Never mind, perhaps
we should go back.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.583
You're the boss.

11:56.666 --> 11:58.625
Turn it off and turn
it back on again.

11:58.666 --> 12:00.375
Bloody thing.

12:00.416 --> 12:01.833
Oh, god, give it here.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.291
We're not gonna be stuck
out here all night.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.708
-I've got it.
-Seriously?

12:05.750 --> 12:06.750
[knocking]

12:10.708 --> 12:11.833
Evening.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.125
You scared the shite out of me.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.208
Sorry about that.

-We're fine, thanks.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.333
That place has been
closed for years.

12:33.375 --> 12:34.833
Closed?

12:34.875 --> 12:35.666
How do you mean?

12:37.791 --> 12:40.666
Look, we're visiting a client.

12:40.708 --> 12:44.958
Yeah, David Peirce.

12:52.041 --> 12:53.708
And you two are?

12:53.750 --> 12:57.791
Sorry, we're with
Social Services,

12:59.416 --> 13:00.625
just checking up on him.

13:09.416 --> 13:10.791
So you know where it is?

13:14.083 --> 13:15.625
Next left, then half a mile.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.125
You can't miss it.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.791
Thanks.

13:27.958 --> 13:29.500
You be careful.

13:30.666 --> 13:34.583
Okay. Thanks for your help.

13:40.416 --> 13:42.708
Fuck's sake, what
was that about?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.541
People never forget, Karl.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.375
Hmm, you got that right.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.375
This is it.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.541
Things are looking up.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.791
Don't get too excited.

14:22.833 --> 14:23.958
Hasn't been open in years.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.583
Not since his father was around.

14:32.125 --> 14:33.916
The Twelve Bears?

14:34.875 --> 14:35.708
Bells.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.416
So his old man left
him this place.

14:40.416 --> 14:41.916
Not too shabby.

14:41.958 --> 14:43.500
Well, it is now.

14:44.916 --> 14:45.708
Shame.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.750
This place is so old.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.125
How old do you think it is?

15:11.333 --> 15:14.208
[knocking on door]

15:18.875 --> 15:20.541
He's probably passed out drunk.

15:23.625 --> 15:26.416
While we're on the subject,
can we hurry this along?

15:26.458 --> 15:27.708
You said we'd be back by now.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.958
Can you just focus on
the job for one minute?

15:31.166 --> 15:32.666
He could be dead in
there for all we know.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.666
Would that be the
end of the world?

15:41.250 --> 15:42.416
How can you be
sure he's in there?

15:42.458 --> 15:44.416
I mean, look at this place.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.416
So what happened to the parents?

15:55.791 --> 15:58.375
They were missing a while
back by the looks of it.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.875
There's no record of the mum,

15:59.916 --> 16:02.750
and the dad's car was found
near a reservoir in Bristol.

16:03.875 --> 16:04.583
No sign of him?

16:05.708 --> 16:06.500
An eye.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.208
[Karl] Excuse me?

16:13.791 --> 16:15.625
They found an eye
near the vehicle.

16:19.833 --> 16:20.583
Jesus.

16:23.541 --> 16:24.916
Bet he didn't see that coming.

[somber music]

[metal clanging]

16:50.500 --> 16:51.625
Holy shit.

16:54.958 --> 16:56.791
I think I found the cellar.

16:59.166 --> 17:02.416
Mr. Peirce, we're here
from Social Services.

17:02.458 --> 17:04.040
Can you come to
the door, please?

17:21.665 --> 17:23.083
Brace yourself.

17:32.291 --> 17:33.708
David?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.875
I'm Jenna Riley,
your case worker,

17:35.916 --> 17:38.166
and this is Karl
Stephens, my colleague.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.875
We've had trouble
getting hold of you.

17:40.916 --> 17:42.291
Do you mind if we come in?

18:00.166 --> 18:03.583
[electricity crackling]

18:20.083 --> 18:22.625
Mine's a Guinness, barkeep.

18:52.333 --> 18:55.458
So, how are things, then?

18:58.666 --> 19:00.666
Have you been looking
after yourself, David?

19:09.708 --> 19:11.041
Shall we take a seat?

19:24.958 --> 19:28.083
[objects clattering]

19:31.958 --> 19:35.083
Do you think he's
got babe station?

19:40.541 --> 19:42.458
Look at the state of this place.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.708
So much for home visits.

19:50.333 --> 19:51.833
So, as I said,

19:51.875 --> 19:53.958
we've had trouble getting
hold of you, David.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.125
Have you settled back in okay?

20:10.875 --> 20:14.916
I read that you spent some
time up at Overlook Hospital,

20:14.958 --> 20:18.375
and you've been back
now for almost a month?

20:20.875 --> 20:23.750
Have you had any
help from anyone?

20:23.791 --> 20:24.708
Family?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.708
[floor creaking]

20:38.750 --> 20:39.750
No?

20:41.333 --> 20:43.958
So the reason we're here
is to check in on you,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.666
see how you're doing,
that sort of thing.

20:48.041 --> 20:51.375
I think you might benefit
from some help, David.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.833
You know, just while
you get on your feet,

20:54.875 --> 20:56.625
-help you adjust.
-I don't need any help.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.833
[Jenna] Just someone
to help out, you know.

21:01.875 --> 21:04.166
[David] If I needed help,
it wouldn't be from you.

21:06.166 --> 21:06.958
David.

21:08.125 --> 21:10.083
You have got to
look after yourself.

21:14.208 --> 21:15.458
Do you have any food in?

21:16.750 --> 21:19.291
So your parents ran this
place when you were a kid.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.791
That must have been interesting.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.208
Do you mind if I
have a look around?

21:22.250 --> 21:23.625
-No, I don't--
-Okay, cool.

21:23.666 --> 21:25.666
No, I don't want you
to go down there, wait.

21:44.791 --> 21:45.791
Wow.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.916
There really is no chance
of getting a pint, is there?

22:01.583 --> 22:02.583
What a waste.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.208
Now we're talking.

22:18.541 --> 22:19.333
Do you play?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.375
We should go back upstairs.

22:33.916 --> 22:34.708
[quietly] Yes.

22:59.666 --> 23:01.791
What's all this about?

23:01.833 --> 23:03.541
We really shouldn't
be down here.

23:11.208 --> 23:12.416
Did somebody break in?

23:13.875 --> 23:14.625
They can't get in.

23:16.833 --> 23:17.625
Who?

23:41.875 --> 23:45.916
David, you don't have
anything here to eat.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.708
We can sort something
out for you.

23:49.666 --> 23:50.833
How?

23:50.875 --> 23:53.541
It's not like they got
a 24-hour hour SPAR.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.666
We're gonna have to come
back after the weekend.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.916
Look, it's getting late, David.

23:59.791 --> 24:01.791
I'm glad your okay,

24:01.833 --> 24:03.583
but we're gonna
have to make a move.

24:04.833 --> 24:07.208
Perhaps we can call back
tomorrow with some food.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.833
We can't have you going
hungry out here until Monday.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.375
We'll just see
ourselves out, okay?

24:15.750 --> 24:16.500
You take care.

24:26.416 --> 24:27.416
We'llcome back?

24:28.416 --> 24:29.208
That's rich.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.708
You're seriously
gonna come back here

24:31.750 --> 24:33.625
on your day off, though?

24:33.666 --> 24:35.416
You're definitely on
your own with that one.

24:35.458 --> 24:36.708
I wouldn't advise it, Jen.

24:36.750 --> 24:37.875
There's something
not right with him.

24:37.916 --> 24:40.833
-Stop!
-[dramatic music]

24:40.875 --> 24:42.208
I can't let you go out there.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.500
David.

24:43.541 --> 24:44.791
-Get back.
-Come on, mate.

24:44.833 --> 24:45.791
[gun clacking]

24:45.833 --> 24:46.625
Now.

25:01.708 --> 25:02.750
Sit down.

25:13.666 --> 25:14.750
What is this all about?

25:16.791 --> 25:18.250
[David] I'm not
gonna let them in.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.083
I'm not gonna let them.

25:20.125 --> 25:20.916
They're not gonna come.

25:20.958 --> 25:22.250
David?

25:22.291 --> 25:23.083
Shut up!

25:24.833 --> 25:25.958
This is for your own good.

25:30.750 --> 25:31.708
It's nearly time.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.458
They're coming.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.208
Who, David?

25:36.250 --> 25:38.750
-We're just here to help you--
-You can't help.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.041
Not even if you knew.

25:44.208 --> 25:45.916
Well, then, please tell us.

25:52.875 --> 25:54.958
What are you doing
with that gun anyway?

25:56.666 --> 25:58.416
Is it even loaded?

25:58.458 --> 26:02.666
[inaudible]

26:15.208 --> 26:16.375
Sod this.

26:17.583 --> 26:19.000
-Sit down!
-Karl!

26:19.041 --> 26:20.250
Sit down.

26:20.291 --> 26:22.250
-It's not even loaded.
-Don't be stupid.

26:25.416 --> 26:26.666
-Are you nuts?
-Me?

26:26.708 --> 26:28.166
You think this is a joke?

26:29.416 --> 26:30.625
You don't know what
they're capable of.

26:33.458 --> 26:35.000
Get away from the door!

26:35.041 --> 26:37.791
[somber music]

27:07.333 --> 27:09.833
[Karl yawning]

27:17.666 --> 27:19.250
It's getting late.

27:21.541 --> 27:24.125
At least let us get some
sleep in one of those rooms.

27:25.250 --> 27:27.083
One with a king size
bed if possible.

27:36.416 --> 27:38.583
Let us go home, David, please.

27:40.208 --> 27:42.208
[David] I can't let
you open the door.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.791
They're waiting for me.

27:45.833 --> 27:46.625
Who?

27:48.791 --> 27:49.875
[David] I won't let them in.

27:51.708 --> 27:53.083
They won't do the
same thing to me.

27:54.958 --> 27:56.708
We won't let them
hurt you, David.

28:01.708 --> 28:05.125
[clock ticking]

28:24.208 --> 28:25.625
[Phone Operator] Thank
you for calling 999.

28:25.666 --> 28:26.750
What's your emergency, please?

28:31.375 --> 28:32.791
Shit!

28:32.833 --> 28:33.916
David, please!

28:34.875 --> 28:36.458
It's not too late.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.791
Everything can go
back to normal,

28:37.833 --> 28:39.291
you haven't done anything yet.

28:39.333 --> 28:40.833
Apart from smashing
my bloody phone.

28:40.875 --> 28:43.208
-Oh, shut up, Karl.
-Don't tell me to shut up.

28:44.125 --> 28:46.083
It's all right for you, he
didn't smash your bloody phone.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.166
Well, if you hadn't
aggravated him--

28:47.208 --> 28:48.041
Shut up!

28:49.666 --> 28:51.666
Someone had to do something.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.958
-Well done, Karl.
-Oh, fuck off.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.583
If you didn't have to
play the good Samaritan,

28:55.625 --> 28:57.750
I'd be home by now, with my
feet up in front of the telly,

28:57.791 --> 28:59.458
-with a beer--
-Both of you, shut up.

29:08.791 --> 29:10.083
No one actually
asked you to come.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.291
Yeah, well, what would've
happened if I hadn't?

29:11.333 --> 29:12.125
Shut up.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.166
It could've been far worse.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.125
How could it have been worse--

29:16.166 --> 29:17.333
Shut up!

29:18.875 --> 29:23.875
-[dramatic music]
-[Karl and David grunting]

29:25.625 --> 29:27.166
Karl!

29:27.208 --> 29:28.000
No!

29:30.875 --> 29:32.375
What is wrong with you?

29:35.083 --> 29:38.041
Someone had to do something.

29:38.083 --> 29:39.708
Well, what if the
gun had gone off?

29:39.750 --> 29:41.375
Fine.

29:41.416 --> 29:42.875
I won't bother next time.

29:42.916 --> 29:43.916
Bloody hell.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.000
And like I said,
it's not even loaded.

29:48.041 --> 29:49.083
I think it's a replica.

29:50.125 --> 29:54.750
-[Jenna gasping]
-[Karl laughing]

29:54.791 --> 29:56.708
You twat.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.208
I am so sorry.

29:59.250 --> 30:01.666
Put the gun down before
you kill someone.

30:01.708 --> 30:03.708
And let Kemper get
his hands on it?

30:03.750 --> 30:04.333
Not a chance.

30:04.375 --> 30:05.375
Karl, just...

30:06.833 --> 30:08.375
Kemper?

30:08.416 --> 30:11.791
Yeah, you know Edmund
Kemper, the co-ed killer.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.291
Killed all those college girls.

30:14.416 --> 30:15.208
Don't move!

30:16.666 --> 30:19.708
Okay, I guess we
better call the police.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.833
Would you mind?

30:22.875 --> 30:24.208
Mine's been playing up.

30:26.250 --> 30:27.833
[Jenna groaning]

30:27.875 --> 30:29.708
-What?
-I left it in the car.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.583
I couldn't get any
signal earlier.

30:31.625 --> 30:32.500
Worth a try.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.791
We'll have to sort
him out first.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.375
[Jenna] What do you mean?

30:37.416 --> 30:38.375
Well, he's dangerous.

30:38.416 --> 30:39.625
We're gonna have
to restrain him.

30:40.875 --> 30:42.958
Is it okay to do
that, do you think?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.791
Under the circumstances.

30:48.666 --> 30:50.125
You get the phone,
I'll wait here.

30:50.166 --> 30:53.166
[Jenna] What if there
really was someone?

30:53.208 --> 30:54.250
[Karl] What'd you mean?

30:54.291 --> 30:56.625
What if he did see
someone out there?

30:56.666 --> 30:58.375
[David] Don't go out there.

30:58.416 --> 30:59.500
Him?

30:59.541 --> 31:00.750
You're taking his word?

31:00.791 --> 31:02.375
-No, but--
-He's as mad

31:02.416 --> 31:03.708
as a box of beaver's balls.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.666
-I'm warning you.
-Quiet, you.

31:07.125 --> 31:08.375
Take a nap or something.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.625
There could be someone.

31:13.666 --> 31:16.791
You saw how the
policewoman was earlier.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.083
People remember, Karl.

31:19.125 --> 31:19.916
Come on.

31:21.416 --> 31:23.916
Even if there is a pitchfork
wielding mob out there,

31:23.958 --> 31:25.666
we'll be all right.

31:25.708 --> 31:27.083
We're just doing our job.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.750
Fine, give me the keys.

31:31.791 --> 31:32.791
I'll go get it.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.625
What, you just gonna
leave me here with?

31:36.666 --> 31:39.166
What, he's not going anywhere.

32:08.625 --> 32:09.666
Seriously?

32:49.583 --> 32:50.333
Fuck.

32:53.416 --> 32:56.166
[object creaking]

32:58.041 --> 32:59.500
David, have you got a cat?

33:00.958 --> 33:03.750
[object creaking]

33:33.666 --> 33:36.500
I think David's got a cat
around here somewhere.

33:36.541 --> 33:38.083
Yeah?

33:38.125 --> 33:41.333
[car engine whirring]

33:46.833 --> 33:49.708
Oh ho, looks like this
nightmare is over.

34:10.916 --> 34:14.583
We thought it was
safer to restrain David

34:14.625 --> 34:15.958
until we could call for help.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.375
Well, I can see the
logic in that at least.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.166
He keeps saying
someone's after him.

34:25.166 --> 34:26.416
Wouldn't be surprised.

34:27.416 --> 34:29.625
What, that's all
you've got to say?

34:29.666 --> 34:34.125
[sighing] Look, it was
awful what happened.

34:34.166 --> 34:36.333
I mean, this used to be
a nice place to live.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.750
But there's still a
lot of bad feeling.

34:38.791 --> 34:40.333
Once word got out about it,

34:40.375 --> 34:42.791
it wasn't long before
the holiday camp closed,

34:42.833 --> 34:44.625
and then the
businesses followed,

34:44.666 --> 34:46.875
and a lot of people moved away.

34:46.916 --> 34:49.208
It just seemed to be
the death of this place.

34:50.416 --> 34:53.083
Someone like that should
have been kept inside.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.791
-That's not very--
-What?

34:56.708 --> 34:58.666
He's been rehabilitated.

34:58.708 --> 34:59.500
Yeah?

35:00.500 --> 35:01.916
And how's that
worked out for you?

35:04.291 --> 35:06.125
I'm gonna have to
call this one in.

35:06.166 --> 35:09.250
If someone's been victimizing
him, we'll look into it.

35:09.291 --> 35:10.833
You can come with me.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.083
And you, you can
keep an eye on him.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.375
[Jenna] He should
be looked after.

35:22.416 --> 35:23.958
Well, I agree.

35:24.875 --> 35:26.750
What's he even doing with a gun?

35:28.041 --> 35:30.750
[dramatic music]

35:32.583 --> 35:33.375
Who's there?

35:39.791 --> 35:42.750
Stop where you are,
that's far enough.

35:56.500 --> 35:57.916
[gun firing]

35:57.958 --> 36:00.875

[Jenna panting]

36:55.666 --> 36:56.791
Who the hell were they?

36:56.833 --> 36:59.166
I told you not to go out.

36:59.208 --> 37:00.416
Fuck!

37:02.875 --> 37:04.666
What the fuck do we do now?

37:05.875 --> 37:06.833
Did you see that?

37:09.500 --> 37:10.333
Clean off.

37:11.708 --> 37:13.625
Keep it together.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.500
We've got to find
a way out of this.

37:16.458 --> 37:17.208
Yeah.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.166
-Okay.
-Oh, my god.

37:20.208 --> 37:23.625
[both breathing deeply]

37:26.416 --> 37:27.625
What the fuck was that?

37:27.666 --> 37:29.833
Who the fuck are they?

37:29.875 --> 37:31.125
What the fuck is going on?

37:32.166 --> 37:33.000
Well?

37:33.041 --> 37:34.375
[Jenna] Karl!

37:34.416 --> 37:35.250
What?

37:35.291 --> 37:36.750
He knows something!

37:36.791 --> 37:37.833
He's said as much.

37:39.208 --> 37:40.000
Fuck.

37:42.416 --> 37:44.125
They're after him.

37:44.166 --> 37:46.541
-First the cat, now this.
-The cat?

37:46.583 --> 37:48.458
I found it hanging out the back.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.916
They know what he did.

37:53.208 --> 37:56.291
It's her, the girl he killed.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.708
Where did you get this?

37:57.750 --> 37:58.750
Your car.

37:58.791 --> 38:00.250
-But--
-They put it there.

38:00.291 --> 38:02.416
-Why would--
-They know what he did.

38:02.458 --> 38:03.291
Who?

38:03.333 --> 38:04.333
How the hell do I know?

38:05.833 --> 38:07.541
There's more.

38:07.583 --> 38:10.458
It says it's linked to a string
of other missing children.

38:12.416 --> 38:13.625
Do you think there were others?

38:13.666 --> 38:15.666
They do, whoever's out there.

38:17.916 --> 38:19.666
Well, we're all in danger now.

38:20.750 --> 38:22.875
No, this proves
they're only after him.

38:22.916 --> 38:25.916
What, are you suggesting
that we give him up?

38:25.958 --> 38:28.833
-Well, I mean, it's--
-We have a duty, Karl.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.041
I'll do a lot for my job,

38:33.375 --> 38:36.666
but I draw the line at
being decapita-- [gagging]

38:37.875 --> 38:39.708
And what if they
don't stop at him?

38:41.208 --> 38:42.583
We need his help.

38:43.708 --> 38:44.791
We're outnumbered.

38:46.416 --> 38:48.833
Now sort your fucking shit out.

39:07.750 --> 39:11.250
I'm gonna untie you,
but if you try anything.

39:19.208 --> 39:22.041
[David] They're back to
finish what they started.

39:23.333 --> 39:23.958
What?

39:25.250 --> 39:27.333
They didn't finish
the job 15 years ago,

39:27.375 --> 39:28.625
and now they're back for me.

39:30.583 --> 39:31.583
Who, David?

39:33.083 --> 39:34.625
Why are they doing this?

39:36.083 --> 39:36.875
For him.

39:40.583 --> 39:42.000
The beast with many names.

40:34.333 --> 40:35.500
What now?

40:53.708 --> 40:54.708
Well?

41:10.041 --> 41:11.208
Well, can you see them?

41:14.666 --> 41:15.666
Well?

41:20.000 --> 41:22.958
We gotta get in that car and
get the hell out of here.

41:24.125 --> 41:25.625
How do you propose we do that?

41:27.708 --> 41:29.208
We still have the shotgun.

41:31.458 --> 41:33.291
We don't know what
we're dealing with.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.333
Well, so we wait?

41:46.416 --> 41:47.958
Well?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.375
[Jenna] What is he doing?

41:52.166 --> 41:55.333
[metal clanging]

41:55.375 --> 41:57.750
Oh, for Christ's sake!

41:57.791 --> 42:00.125
-Thank you, dickhead!
-Shit!

42:01.416 --> 42:02.416
Brilliant.

42:06.416 --> 42:07.375
Fuck!

42:10.000 --> 42:10.750
Fuck!

42:21.708 --> 42:22.666
You with the AA?

42:33.291 --> 42:35.375
The police car's
around the corner.

42:35.416 --> 42:37.458
What if they do the same?

42:37.500 --> 42:39.041
We better get a wriggle on.

42:39.083 --> 42:41.750
[somber music]

42:52.666 --> 42:53.583
Go on then.

42:54.500 --> 42:55.250
Why me?

42:58.916 --> 42:59.750
Fine.

43:05.833 --> 43:06.708
Be careful.

43:08.791 --> 43:10.916
She's dead, Karl.

43:10.958 --> 43:12.875
Yeah, well, you know.

43:27.125 --> 43:28.416
Have you got 'em?

43:28.458 --> 43:30.333
[Jenna] Ah, got 'em.

43:30.375 --> 43:33.250
-[banging on door]
-[dramatic music]

43:33.291 --> 43:34.750
Come on, come on.

43:35.416 --> 43:36.625
We'll have to go out the back.

43:36.666 --> 43:37.625
Create a distraction.

43:37.666 --> 43:39.166
I don't know, Karl.

43:39.208 --> 43:42.750
-We're gonna have to go to--
-[explosion rumbling]

43:51.791 --> 43:52.583
Fuck!

43:54.375 --> 43:55.833
Fuck, fucking fuck!

43:59.541 --> 44:02.000
This fucking keeps
getting better and better.

44:02.041 --> 44:03.750
Calm down!

44:03.791 --> 44:05.708
This isn't doing any good.

44:05.750 --> 44:06.625
They're here for him.

44:06.666 --> 44:08.583
-Let's give him to them.
-No!

44:09.583 --> 44:11.416
What are we waiting for?

44:11.458 --> 44:13.583
He's had it coming for what
he did to that little girl.

44:13.625 --> 44:15.458
-Karl, that's--
-Unprofessional?

44:15.500 --> 44:17.708
Jen, you're a broken record.

44:18.875 --> 44:20.375
-I didn't do it.
-What?

44:20.416 --> 44:21.375
I didn't kill her.

44:21.416 --> 44:22.791
Sure you didn't, Norman.

44:35.541 --> 44:36.625
Are you done?

44:38.833 --> 44:41.458
If we're gonna get through
this, we need to stay calm.

44:44.125 --> 44:46.791
If you find anything,
mine's a double.

44:49.500 --> 44:50.500
[David] Dad's van.

44:51.916 --> 44:52.708
Dad's van?

44:54.500 --> 44:55.625
[David] It's in the garage.

44:56.791 --> 44:57.708
The keys.

44:57.750 --> 44:59.166
Well, can we get to the garage?

44:59.208 --> 45:00.875
Well, it's worth a try at least.

45:02.833 --> 45:05.000
Maybe he's right, we
should just wait it out.

45:05.041 --> 45:06.666
Wait for what?

45:06.708 --> 45:07.750
Morning.

45:07.791 --> 45:09.208
Morning?

45:09.250 --> 45:11.416
What, you think the milkman's
gonna come and save you?

45:11.458 --> 45:14.791
Look around you, Jen, this
could be our last chance.

45:19.500 --> 45:20.833
Someone might've seen that.

45:25.458 --> 45:27.166
-The cellar.
-What?

45:27.208 --> 45:28.583
We'll be safe down there.

45:28.625 --> 45:30.666
We'll be fucking
trapped down there.

45:35.541 --> 45:36.333
Okay, then.

45:37.750 --> 45:39.708
We'll get at it
through the back.

45:39.750 --> 45:42.166
I didn't see any of
them round there.

45:42.208 --> 45:44.083
We'll have a clear
shot at the garage.

45:46.333 --> 45:48.291
But we've got to find
those keys first.

45:49.791 --> 45:51.708
-[glass shattering]
-[Jenna screaming]

45:51.750 --> 45:52.791
Oh, fuck!

45:52.833 --> 45:55.791
[dramatic music]

45:56.750 --> 45:59.625
[Karl grunting]

46:01.041 --> 46:03.125
Fucking, not the gun, no!

46:05.375 --> 46:07.041
Fuck, can you see it?

46:08.166 --> 46:10.958
[Jenna screaming]

46:20.458 --> 46:21.750
Fucking shoot it!

46:27.708 --> 46:30.541
[Jenna gasping]

46:41.791 --> 46:43.250
[creature shrieking]

46:43.291 --> 46:45.875
[Karl grunting]

46:48.958 --> 46:50.041
[Jenna grunts]

46:50.083 --> 46:52.916
[Jenna panting]

46:52.958 --> 46:54.291
What do we do now?

46:54.333 --> 46:55.416
David, grab an end.

47:01.541 --> 47:02.791
[Karl panting]

47:02.833 --> 47:05.666
[creature shrieking]

47:09.583 --> 47:10.500
The cellar, Karl?

47:11.500 --> 47:12.291
Really?

47:52.541 --> 47:54.208
What are you doing?

47:54.250 --> 47:56.583
I don't know about you,
but I need a drink.

47:58.166 --> 48:01.291
[creature screaming]

48:14.875 --> 48:17.791
What kind of a
fucking bar is this?

48:18.916 --> 48:19.791
Under there.

48:30.708 --> 48:33.166
[David] You're a dark horse.

48:33.208 --> 48:34.833
It was Dad's.

48:34.875 --> 48:35.666
Vintage.

48:46.708 --> 48:47.750
None for me.

48:49.291 --> 48:50.083
Oh yeah?

48:54.666 --> 48:55.750
Here's to us.

48:58.958 --> 49:01.291
[exhaling]

49:02.750 --> 49:04.541
To continued
commitment to the job.

49:13.125 --> 49:14.666
Here's to doing our duty.

49:14.708 --> 49:15.708
Stop it, Karl.

49:16.833 --> 49:17.625
You finished?

49:19.416 --> 49:20.625
There's still a bit left.

49:23.041 --> 49:24.666
Well, I think that's enough.

49:30.458 --> 49:32.083
David, where are
the keys to the van?

49:32.125 --> 49:35.208
You're not still considering
going out there are you?

49:35.250 --> 49:36.666
Did you see that thing?

49:37.958 --> 49:39.166
What the fuck was that?

49:40.875 --> 49:41.666
David?

49:42.750 --> 49:44.500
You seemed to know
they were coming.

49:44.541 --> 49:45.333
What are they?

49:47.791 --> 49:48.583
Not them.

49:50.500 --> 49:51.291
Not them?

49:52.541 --> 49:53.750
You were expecting someone else?

49:53.791 --> 49:54.666
Does it matter?

49:54.708 --> 49:56.750
It doesn't change anything.

49:56.791 --> 49:59.083
You're the one that
wanted to get out.

49:59.125 --> 50:02.125
Maybe it's not such a bad
thing to wait till morning.

50:02.166 --> 50:04.750
Maybe they'll burn
up or something.

50:04.791 --> 50:05.791
Vampires, Karl?

50:05.833 --> 50:08.583
Oh, yeah, like
that's outrageous.

50:09.458 --> 50:11.375
Well, what are they, then?

50:11.416 --> 50:12.791
Did you see its eyes?

50:12.833 --> 50:14.416
You've seen too many films.

50:14.458 --> 50:16.208
Well, what, then?

50:16.250 --> 50:17.166
Spice?

50:18.583 --> 50:21.125
I've seen spice do
a lot of crazy shit,

50:21.166 --> 50:22.500
but I've never seen
someone on spice

50:22.541 --> 50:23.916
tear a person's head clean off.

50:23.958 --> 50:24.750
Whatever.

50:25.958 --> 50:27.583
David, we've got
to find the keys.

50:39.625 --> 50:41.875
Feel free to chime in
with your thoughts.

51:30.916 --> 51:32.416
So what was it, then?

51:36.416 --> 51:38.833
Did your dad beat you?

51:38.875 --> 51:40.333
Did he like a drink?

51:41.958 --> 51:43.750
Is that why you did it?

51:43.791 --> 51:45.083
I didn't do anything.

51:47.708 --> 51:48.666
Sure you didn't.

51:52.708 --> 51:54.333
So why are we in this mess?

51:57.666 --> 51:58.916
Because of what they did.

52:08.666 --> 52:10.666
Who are they, David?

52:15.750 --> 52:18.625
[banging on walls]

52:31.666 --> 52:33.708
[keys jingling]

52:33.750 --> 52:34.541
Hey.

53:11.916 --> 53:13.708
What the hell is this?

53:24.416 --> 53:25.791
Did David do this?

53:30.291 --> 53:31.291
Is that him?

53:33.000 --> 53:33.791
I'm sure it is.

53:35.875 --> 53:37.750
What the hell is this?

53:39.166 --> 53:39.958
A cult?

53:45.375 --> 53:48.958
Michael Peirce,
oh shit, his dad.

53:53.791 --> 53:54.583
Look.

53:55.958 --> 53:56.708
There.

53:57.875 --> 53:59.791
It's her, the missing girl.

54:02.916 --> 54:05.833
[banging on walls]

54:08.583 --> 54:11.708
[objects clattering]

54:33.458 --> 54:35.208
That girl went missing
from a campsite.

54:35.250 --> 54:36.625
So?

54:36.666 --> 54:38.875
So what's she doing here
with David's family?

54:39.916 --> 54:41.666
-Holy shit.
-What?

54:43.458 --> 54:45.125
What if it wasn't just David?

54:45.166 --> 54:46.625
[Jenna] What do you mean?

54:46.666 --> 54:50.458
The girl, what if it
wasn't just David involved?

54:50.500 --> 54:52.791
There was many more
by the looks of it.

54:52.833 --> 54:54.666
Oh, come on, Karl, really?

54:55.625 --> 54:57.541
I've heard of these cults.

54:57.583 --> 55:00.250
Devil worship, human sacrifice.

55:00.291 --> 55:01.750
Who knows what they were up to?

55:03.833 --> 55:06.666
And what about them out there?

55:11.250 --> 55:13.041
[Karl] I don't know.

55:15.250 --> 55:18.041
[David screaming in distance]

55:19.000 --> 55:21.708
[dramatic music]

55:30.750 --> 55:31.750
[Jenna] David!

55:31.791 --> 55:32.583
David!

55:33.916 --> 55:35.125
No, you can't!

55:35.166 --> 55:37.041
[Karl] Fucking help
him, you useless prick!

55:37.083 --> 55:38.458
Whoa, what?

55:38.500 --> 55:40.375
He's gone, Jenna, it's no good.

55:40.416 --> 55:41.541
Get off me!

55:43.875 --> 55:45.833
I can't let them have him.

55:47.333 --> 55:48.333
I'm sorry.

55:51.291 --> 55:54.000
[Jenna groaning]

55:55.666 --> 55:56.750
-Fuck!
-[glass shattering]

55:56.791 --> 55:59.625
[Jenna panting]

56:07.875 --> 56:09.125
Maybe they'll go away now.

56:10.083 --> 56:11.750
They got what they
wanted, right?

56:11.791 --> 56:14.708
[banging on walls]

56:16.583 --> 56:18.041
I don't think so.

56:19.125 --> 56:21.083
Well, what the fuck?

56:21.125 --> 56:23.208
He's the one they were after!

56:23.250 --> 56:24.833
And that thing in the cellar?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.291
Would you stop trying
to apply logic to this?

56:30.708 --> 56:31.750
Christ.

56:33.666 --> 56:35.375
I don't fucking think so!

56:40.958 --> 56:42.416
What did you do that for?

56:43.541 --> 56:45.250
I need you sober.

56:45.291 --> 56:46.666
Yeah, well, I fucking don't.

56:59.916 --> 57:01.333
[somber music]

57:10.208 --> 57:11.583
It just doesn't make sense.

57:22.541 --> 57:25.000
[Karl sighing]

57:35.750 --> 57:37.750
So why did things never
go anywhere with us?

57:40.083 --> 57:41.833
Is this really the time, Karl?

57:43.041 --> 57:45.458
I can't think of a better time.

57:45.500 --> 57:47.625
Probably the last chance,
come to think of it.

57:50.791 --> 57:52.708
Some people just
don't mesh, I guess.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.708
-Good stock answer there.
-What do you want me to say?

57:59.041 --> 58:00.208
We work together.

58:01.125 --> 58:03.791
-Now I remember.
-What?

58:03.833 --> 58:05.250
The job.

58:05.291 --> 58:06.541
What's that supposed to mean?

58:06.583 --> 58:07.791
You're not allowed
to have a life.

58:07.833 --> 58:09.291
Bit of fun sometimes.

58:10.333 --> 58:12.000
Maybe...

58:12.041 --> 58:13.166
Maybe what?

58:14.708 --> 58:16.333
Maybe we wouldn't be stuck
out in the middle of nowhere

58:16.375 --> 58:17.958
on a Friday night
with the horde of hell

58:18.000 --> 58:19.500
breathing down our necks.

58:23.958 --> 58:27.291
-Fuck this job.
-[both laughing]

58:35.166 --> 58:35.958
Mm?

58:38.083 --> 58:39.750
[Jenna] What is it?

58:41.458 --> 58:42.250
Hang on.

58:43.375 --> 58:44.458
What is it?

58:44.500 --> 58:46.458
I read about this in the news.

58:46.500 --> 58:48.666
It was around Halloween
last year, he went missing.

58:48.708 --> 58:50.041
They recently found his body.

58:51.125 --> 58:52.291
When did David get out?

58:55.083 --> 58:56.458
It was about a month ago.

58:56.500 --> 58:58.000
This one couldn't have been him.

59:00.083 --> 59:01.083
-And the old man,
-What?

59:01.125 --> 59:02.833
maybe he's not dead.

59:02.875 --> 59:05.541
-The cult, Halloween--
-Come on.

59:06.750 --> 59:09.916
Halloween, Samhain, I
saw it in a documentary.

59:09.958 --> 59:11.250
These ancient druids

59:11.291 --> 59:13.791
would gather up all the
children for sacrifice.

59:13.833 --> 59:15.416
We need to get out of here.

59:16.833 --> 59:18.583
-Karl.
-Oh, yeah.

59:18.625 --> 59:19.666
We go through the cellar.

59:19.708 --> 59:20.958
The cellar?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.041
Past that thing?

59:22.083 --> 59:23.166
It's the best way
to get to the van.

59:23.208 --> 59:24.000
You think?

59:25.000 --> 59:26.500
At the very least,

59:26.541 --> 59:28.458
maybe his dad'll have another
stash of whiskey down there.

59:28.500 --> 59:29.791
That's the spirit.

59:29.833 --> 59:30.625
Good one.

59:32.333 --> 59:33.083
Never mind.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.416
[tape ripping]

59:45.708 --> 59:46.875
[gun clacking]

59:46.916 --> 59:47.708
Let's go.

01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:05.625
Where is it?

01:00:05.666 --> 01:00:06.458
Wait.

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:19.750
Karl.

01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:21.500
[creature growling]

01:00:21.541 --> 01:00:22.583
Karl.

01:00:22.625 --> 01:00:24.875
[gun firing]

01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:29.291
[Karl gasping]

01:00:57.875 --> 01:01:00.958
[creature shrieking]

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:07.500
Fucking hell!

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:11.666
Not again!

01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:17.083
David?

01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:24.208
What happened?

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.250
It's good to see you, buddy.

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:27.583
I thought I had it there.

01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:31.333
What happened?

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:33.333
We thought you were...

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:35.833
You came back.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:38.791
Yeah, you've got the truck keys.

01:01:38.833 --> 01:01:39.750
I can't drive.

01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:47.208
How did you get away?

01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:50.166
[David] I got through the hatch.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:51.458
What, just like that?

01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:54.125
They didn't get you?

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:54.916
[David] I ran.

01:01:57.041 --> 01:01:58.000
The hatch?

01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:01.250
Don't worry, I locked it.

01:02:02.458 --> 01:02:04.333
Well, it is good
to see you, David.

01:02:07.541 --> 01:02:08.333
Karl?

01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:19.083
[somber music]

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:44.875
What the hell?

01:03:06.333 --> 01:03:07.916
What is this, David?

01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:22.125
I must've read this
a thousand times.

01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:25.541
You slept down here?

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:32.125
They kept me here until
it was his time to ascend.

01:03:33.708 --> 01:03:34.708
Who to ascend?

01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:37.750
The beast?

01:03:40.458 --> 01:03:42.208
Come on, David, you can't
believe that sort of crap.

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.125
What'd you think
has been happening?

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.875
Those things out there
are a part of it somehow,

01:03:48.916 --> 01:03:50.041
I can feel it.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.083
I thought that the followers,

01:04:01.125 --> 01:04:03.416
the acolytes had
returned for me,

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:11.583
but it seems that someone
has been continuing his work.

01:04:17.166 --> 01:04:19.500
His time has begun.

01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:21.375
[gun thuds]

01:04:22.416 --> 01:04:26.875
[Jenna chanting in
foreign language]

01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:11.666
[chains clanking]

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:20.541
Jenna?

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.750
What are you doing?

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:26.750
Jenna untie us.

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.625
Trick or treat, Karl?

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:39.666
All Hallows Eve, 15 years
ago, in this very room,

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:40.791
we started something.

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:46.208
What are you talking about?

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:47.791
Jenna untie us.

01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:51.416
-This isn't right.
-Right?

01:05:52.458 --> 01:05:53.958
What would you know about right?

01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:59.541
-You're a worm, Karl.
-This isn't you Jenna.

01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:02.541
No, it's not, because
Jenna was never real.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.125
Now you're fucking scaring me.

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:08.750
They all get scared before
their eyes go black.

01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:12.750
No, not you.

01:06:15.583 --> 01:06:17.458
You don't know me, Karl.

01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:21.708
I've lived this lie
for long enough.

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:25.750
Dealing with the dregs of
humanity, it sickens me.

01:06:25.791 --> 01:06:28.208
The lame and helpless.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.333
The species is weak.

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:32.791
He will strengthen us.

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:35.500
You're scaring the
shit out of me.

01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:36.666
What's going through your head?

01:06:36.708 --> 01:06:38.500
-You've fucking lost it.
-Can't you see?

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:42.875
All these years I've been in
hiding, running from the light.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:45.583
Now I have David here.

01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:47.583
He's home, we're home.

01:06:48.708 --> 01:06:52.208
On this day, I can
finish it, begin again.

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:56.875
You were in those pictures.

01:06:56.916 --> 01:06:59.416
You're catching up at last.

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.875
-And the rest of the cult?
-Cult?

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:09.625
Only the smallest of minds
would see it that way.

01:07:11.083 --> 01:07:15.083
Sorry, the rest of the
rejects from the loony bin.

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:17.041
Do not speak ill of them.

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:21.833
I'm the only one left,
left to serve him.

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:22.666
Him, Jenna?

01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:25.458
Pull yourself together.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.666
He is all around us, Karl.

01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:29.875
You will weep at his majesty.

01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:31.583
What are you babbling about?

01:07:31.625 --> 01:07:33.208
You killed them kids.

01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:42.333
Mm-hmm, just a small offering.

01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:44.708
But this, the one that got away

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:46.750
before we could
complete the ceremony.

01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:53.958
You were always so feeble.

01:07:56.916 --> 01:07:59.375
You have escaped your
fate for long enough,

01:07:59.416 --> 01:08:01.958
but you will fulfill
your destiny.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.833
'Tis a shame your
father couldn't be here

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.833
to see us bring back
the morning star.

01:08:10.458 --> 01:08:11.333
The what?

01:08:14.833 --> 01:08:17.500
You killed them little
kids for a star?

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:19.291
You're fucking mental.

01:08:19.332 --> 01:08:21.500
I can't believe I
was gonna shag you.

01:08:21.541 --> 01:08:22.832
Bitch!

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:23.666
Idiot.

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:26.332
None of it matters now anyway.

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:33.082
When the virgin's blood
spills on this altar,

01:08:33.125 --> 01:08:33.916
Oh, David.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.166
[Jenna] we will
finish what we started

01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:37.457
-all those years ago.
-How can you be sure

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.582
he's a virgin?

01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:39.791
I mean, he spent a
long while in jail.

01:08:39.832 --> 01:08:41.582
You hear stories about
soap and showers--

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:44.125
We will complete the ritual,

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:46.416
and Lucifer will
walk the earth again.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:51.582
'Tis a pity I don't have
anything better to offer him

01:08:51.625 --> 01:08:55.666
than you, Karl, but needs must.

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:56.707
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:58.332
You really are off your rocker.

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:00.582
-You think the Devil is--
-Silence!

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:04.207
That's why you came here.

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:08.375
Why did you have
to drag me into it?

01:09:08.416 --> 01:09:11.082
You dragged yourself in, moron.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.500
And those things outside.

01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:16.666
They're after you.

01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:18.666
They're not after
David, the poor fucker.

01:09:18.707 --> 01:09:20.707
He was telling the
truth all along.

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:23.125
It was you that was after him.

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:27.582
Jenna, you gotta stop this.

01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:29.166
You've opened the gates of hell.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.000
What am I talking about?

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.666
This is fuckin mental.

01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:32.750
Fuck!

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.500
Jenna, you don't know
what you've unleashed.

01:09:35.541 --> 01:09:37.125
Those things are
gonna kill us all.

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:38.707
Silence!

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:42.291
Or I will not give you the honor
of being the first rendered

01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:44.500
unto the dark lord.

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:45.707
Yeah?

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:47.707
-That's not much of a threat.
-No?

01:09:49.666 --> 01:09:53.291
Instead I will cut your balls
off and let you bleed out.

You fucking idiot.

01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:04.833
You broke the ritual.
