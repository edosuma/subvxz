WEBVTT

00:04.750 --> 00:05.999
Joey: HEY, MEL.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.079
LOOK AT THIS.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.079
MY MOM'S ON HER WAY HERE, BUT SHE JUST SENT
ME THIS VIDEO BEFORE SHE GOT ON THE PLANE.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.169
Aren't you proud of me, Joey?

00:12.170 --> 00:14.329
I'm so high-tech.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.709
Anyway, I just saw the pilot.

00:16.710 --> 00:19.169
He doesn't even look
old enough to shave.

00:19.170 --> 00:20.790
I think I saw pimples.

00:21.750 --> 00:22.789
Anyway,

00:22.790 --> 00:24.289
if the worst should happen

00:24.290 --> 00:25.749
and it probably will,

00:25.750 --> 00:29.119
don't let your brother and
sister give away my furniture.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.419
And one of you has to adopt Mr.
Whiskers.

00:31.420 --> 00:33.330
Not your sister. Bye.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.119
YOU HEAR THAT?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.249
THAT'S THE CLOSEST MY MOM'S
COME TO EVER MAKING A WILL.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.120
SERIOUSLY?

00:39.121 --> 00:40.959
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING WRITTEN DOWN?

00:40.960 --> 00:42.789
NOPE, SHE WILL NOT TALK
ABOUT DYING, HONEY.

00:42.790 --> 00:45.249
I ONCE SUGGESTED THAT WE PLAY
AMAZING GRACE AT HER FUNERAL,

00:45.250 --> 00:47.119
AND SHE ACCUSED ME
OF WANTING HER DEAD.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.169
"YES, MOM, I WANT YOU DEAD

00:49.170 --> 00:51.289
"BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO HEAR AMAZING GRACE."

00:51.290 --> 00:53.579
AW, JOE, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE LEFT WITH THE MESS

00:53.580 --> 00:56.170
MY MOM AND DAD HAD TO GO THROUGH
WHEN MY NANNY-NOO DIED.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.619
YOUR NANNY-NOO?

00:58.620 --> 01:00.879
YEAH, IT'S WHAT WE
CALLED MY GRANDMA.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.709
YOU KNOW, WHEN SHE
DIED WITHOUT A WILL.

01:02.710 --> 01:05.079
LEAVING 16 BURKE
GRANDCHILDREN TO FIGHT OVER

01:05.080 --> 01:09.079
A MONKEY PAW UMBRELLA AND AN
AUTOGRAPHED PHOTO OF LIBERACE.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.959
I'M STILL STUCK ON NANNY-NOO.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.789
HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:12.790 --> 01:14.459
WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO YOUR MOM WHEN
SHE'S HERE THIS WEEKEND? FACE-TO-FACE.

01:14.460 --> 01:17.289
NO. NO, NO. MY MOTHER WILL
NOT TALK ABOUT DYING.

01:17.290 --> 01:19.329
I'M NOT TALKING TO HER ABOUT IT,
YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO HER ABOUT IT,

01:19.330 --> 01:20.459
NOBODY'S TALKING
TO HER ABOUT IT.

01:20.460 --> 01:21.579
BUT IT'S THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY,

01:21.580 --> 01:24.329
- OTHERWISE...
- ♪ AMAZING GRACE ♪

01:24.330 --> 01:27.459
♪ HOW SWEET THE SOUND ♪

01:27.460 --> 01:29.169
(theme music playing)

01:29.170 --> 01:31.789
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

01:31.790 --> 01:34.080
♪ WITH ME ♪

01:36.920 --> 01:39.709
AND THE WEATHER TURNED
SO COLD ALL OF A SUDDEN,

01:39.710 --> 01:41.289
ALL MY FLOWERS DIED.

01:41.290 --> 01:43.079
IF ONLY I HAD PLANNED BETTER

01:43.080 --> 01:44.419
BEFORE THEY ALL WENT

01:44.420 --> 01:46.420
(mimics plane crashing) DEAD.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.539
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
WANNA SAY SOMETHING.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.499
WHAT? NO. HM-MMM. NO.
WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.169
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HONEY?

01:57.170 --> 01:59.669
- YEAH. OKAY, YOU'RE SQUEEZING MY
HAND REALLY TIGHT. -I'M SORRY.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.039
(doorbell rings)

02:01.040 --> 02:02.619
OH, I'LL GET IT.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.829
I WON'T ASK ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN,

02:04.830 --> 02:06.879
UNLESS I SHOULD ASK
ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN?

02:06.880 --> 02:08.210
- MOM!
- I WASN'T ASKING.

02:09.290 --> 02:10.329
DADDY!

02:10.330 --> 02:12.079
HELLO, PUMPKIN!

02:12.080 --> 02:14.039
AND WHO DO WE HAVE HERE?

02:14.040 --> 02:16.289
WHY IT'S GLORIA LONGO.

02:16.290 --> 02:18.289
PLEASURE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, MY LADY.

02:18.290 --> 02:19.539
SENATOR.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.210
I HAVE TO SHARE MY TIME
HERE WITH THAT ONE?

02:23.830 --> 02:25.379
I DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS COMING OVER.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.419
IT WAS A TOTAL SURPRISE TO ME.
RIGHT, DADDY?

02:27.420 --> 02:29.289
YUP. JUST FLEW IN ON A SPUR.

02:29.290 --> 02:30.709
I LOVE COMING TO TOLEDO.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.169
I GET TO VISIT MY DAUGHTER,

02:32.170 --> 02:34.039
I GET TO VISIT MY PARENTS.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.289
OH, YOUR PARENTS LIVE HERE?

02:35.290 --> 02:36.960
THEIR SOULS DO...

02:39.000 --> 02:40.789
AT TOLEDO FOREVER CEMETERY.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.749
I'VE GOT A SPOT
RIGHT NEXT TO THEM.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.210
SURPRISINGLY AFFORDABLE.

02:45.460 --> 02:46.829
PLANNING FOR YOUR ESTATE,

02:46.830 --> 02:48.709
WHAT A LOVING THING TO
DO FOR YOUR FAMILY.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.959
SIT. TELL US MORE!

02:49.960 --> 02:51.539
YOU BROUGHT YOUR FATHER HERE

02:51.540 --> 02:53.169
TO TALK TO MY
MOTHER ABOUT DEATH?

02:53.170 --> 02:54.709
I DID IT FOR YOU, OKAY?

02:54.710 --> 02:56.579
GLORIA WILL LISTEN TO
SOMEONE HER OWN AGE.

02:56.580 --> 02:57.919
AND, IF SHE GETS MAD,

02:57.920 --> 02:59.749
SHE'LL GIVE HIM THE EVIL
EYE, NOT YOU AND ME.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.789
HOW COULD YOU...

03:01.790 --> 03:03.789
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT
COULD ACTUALLY WORK.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.619
SO, TELL ME, GLORIA,

03:05.620 --> 03:07.959
HAVE YOU HAD THE CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR FAMILY

03:07.960 --> 03:10.419
ABOUT WHAT YOU'D LIKE
DONE AFTER YOU...

03:10.420 --> 03:15.120
SHUFFLE OFF THIS VERY
SHAPELY MORTAL COIL?

03:17.670 --> 03:19.789
WHAT?

03:19.790 --> 03:23.790
GIVE UP THE GHOST. KICK THE BUCKET.
DIE.

03:25.380 --> 03:28.249
OH, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.040
THIS IS AMAZING GRACE
ALL OVER AGAIN!

03:32.920 --> 03:35.209
WELL, MAYBE YOU'LL
GET LUCKY, JOEY,

03:35.210 --> 03:37.169
AND I'LL JUST CROAK
IN MY SLEEP TONIGHT.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.209
SWEET DREAMS.

03:38.210 --> 03:40.619
MA! MOM! MOM! MOM!

03:40.620 --> 03:42.079
WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT'S NOT WHAT...

03:42.080 --> 03:44.329
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY MEANT! MOM!

03:44.330 --> 03:46.539
WAY TO GO GUYS. NICE PLAN.
THAT'S EXCELLENT. MM-HMM.

03:46.540 --> 03:48.289
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO UP
THERE AND APOLOGIZE TO HER

03:48.290 --> 03:49.829
FOR SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT DO.

03:49.830 --> 03:53.119
CALM DOWN. YOUR MOTHER'S
A VERY SENSITIVE SOUL.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.790
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS AND SEE
IF I CAN SMOOTH THINGS OVER.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.579
NO OFFENSE, JOSEPH, BUT...

04:01.580 --> 04:03.880
YOU KIND OF SET PEOPLE OFF.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.959
(knocking at the door)

04:11.960 --> 04:13.169
ZANDER! (chuckles nervously)

04:13.170 --> 04:14.959
WE NEED TO TALK...

04:14.960 --> 04:17.709
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER DAY.

04:17.710 --> 04:20.249
OH, YOU MEAN WHEN WE
FELL INTO BED TOGETHER?

04:20.250 --> 04:22.379
AND ROLLED AROUND AND STUFF?

04:22.380 --> 04:23.749
YEAH.

04:23.750 --> 04:26.459
THE ROLLING AROUND
AND EVERYTHING WAS

04:26.460 --> 04:28.879
EXCITING AND PASSIONATE.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.619
THANK YOU. YOU WERE
NO SLOUCH, EITHER.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.119
THANKS.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.119
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW,

04:34.120 --> 04:38.039
I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.919
- YOU KNOW, WE'RE GREAT AT
BEING FRIENDS. -AGREED.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.539
AND WE'RE GREAT AT...

04:43.540 --> 04:45.079
ROLLING AROUND.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.789
(laughs) TOTALLY AGREED.

04:47.790 --> 04:50.499
BUT, EVERY TIME WE TRY TO DO THE
BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND THING,

04:50.500 --> 04:53.829
YOU KNOW, IT JUST ENDS
UP IN TEARS AND SOBBING.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.540
I DON'T STIFLE MY FEELINGS.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.499
OKAY. MY POINT IS,

04:59.500 --> 05:04.039
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF WE JUST KEEP THE FUN STUFF,
AND LOSE THE TRICKY RELATIONSHIP STUFF?

05:04.040 --> 05:05.749
YOU MEAN, BE FRIENDS
WITH BENEFITS?

05:05.750 --> 05:09.119
YEAH. EXCEPT I WISH IT
DIDN'T SOUND SO CLICHE.

05:09.120 --> 05:12.289
OH, OH! WHAT IF WE CALL IT
SOMETHING ELSE, LIKE, UM...

05:12.290 --> 05:13.959
"FRIENDS PLUS"?

05:13.960 --> 05:16.620
OH, HOW ABOUT "AMIGOS
CON EL SEXO"?

05:18.380 --> 05:19.749
SUPAH-FRIENDS.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.079
ONLY IF WE CAN SPELL
IT WITH A "Z."

05:21.080 --> 05:23.749
OH, NO. JUST A SECOND.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.209
IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS,

05:25.210 --> 05:27.379
I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR
THAT WE ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE.

05:27.380 --> 05:30.879
IF THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES TO HAVE A
SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE,

05:30.880 --> 05:31.919
WE CAN PURSUE IT.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.169
ABSOLUTELY.

05:33.170 --> 05:35.959
AND BELIEVE ME, OTHER LADIES
ARE GONNA BE INTERESTED

05:35.960 --> 05:38.379
- IN THE ZAN-MAN.
- DON'T CALL YOURSELF THAT.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.170
- I WAS JUST TRYING IT OUT.
- IT'S REALLY BAD.

05:45.330 --> 05:46.379
DADDY?

05:46.380 --> 05:47.999
HEY, PUMPKIN.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.039
WHY ARE YOU COMING OUT OF
GLORIA'S ROOM IN YOUR UNDERWEAR?

05:51.040 --> 05:53.669
WELL, WHEN I FIRST
CAME UPSTAIRS,

05:53.670 --> 05:55.499
GLORIA WAS IN TEARS, POOR THING.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.789
SHE WAS FEELINGS LIKE
HER LIFE WAS OVER.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.119
BUT TOGETHER, WE HAVE PROVEN

06:00.120 --> 06:03.250
THAT SHE IS STILL FULL
OF VITALITY AND PASSION.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.039
YOU SLEPT WITH HER?

06:07.040 --> 06:11.119
OH, MEL, YOU KNOW I
NEVER KISS AND TELL...

06:11.120 --> 06:12.830
BUT HELL YEAH.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.170
HEY. SO, HOW'S MY MOM?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.170
BETTER.

06:24.920 --> 06:29.250
APPARENTLY, MY FATHER
GAVE HER A GOOD...

06:30.500 --> 06:32.210
TALKING TO.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.419
SO, ARE THEY WRAPPING IT UP?

06:35.420 --> 06:38.000
I HOPE THEY WRAPPED IT
UP BEFORE THEY STARTED.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.039
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.249
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GONNA GO UP THERE
AND SAY GOOD NIGHT TO HER, THEN.

06:44.250 --> 06:47.039
NO, NO, NO, NO! YOUR MOM
IS TOTALLY WORN OUT.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.170
YOU KNOW, FROM ALL THE...

06:53.000 --> 06:54.210
(high-pitched) TALKING.

06:58.170 --> 06:59.579
HELLO.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.579
I'M HERE FOR OUR FIRST NIGHT
OF BENEFITS BETWEEN FRIENDS

07:01.580 --> 07:02.620
AS SCHEDULED.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.329
EXCELLENT. AND, SINCE
THIS ISN'T A DATE-DATE,

07:06.330 --> 07:09.170
I DIDN'T SHAVE MY LEGS.

07:10.620 --> 07:11.669
NEITHER DID I.

07:11.670 --> 07:13.039
(laughing)

07:13.040 --> 07:14.749
AND I BROUGHT YOU A CUPCAKE.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.289
A GIFT?

07:16.290 --> 07:18.919
YOU CAN'T BRING ME GIFTS!
THAT'S A COUPLES THING!

07:18.920 --> 07:20.330
IT'S JUST A CUPCAKE.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.579
NO, ZANDER, WE HAVE TO
BE CRYSTAL CLEAR, OKAY?

07:24.580 --> 07:26.169
THERE CAN BE NO
DATE-LIKE ACTIVITIES.

07:26.170 --> 07:29.419
NO NUZZLING, NO CUDDLING,
AND DEFINITELY NO GIFTS!

07:29.420 --> 07:31.119
OKAY, FINE THEN.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.289
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL JUST
EAT THE CUPCAKE, THEN.

07:33.290 --> 07:36.289
YEAH! MMM!

07:36.290 --> 07:37.579
IT'S DELICIOUS!

07:37.580 --> 07:39.580
YOU HAPPY? ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

07:42.080 --> 07:44.459
OKAY, MAYBE I OVERREACTED.

07:44.460 --> 07:47.209
I'M SORRY. LET'S
JUST GO UPSTAIRS.

07:47.210 --> 07:48.250
HERE.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.080
YOU KNOW WHAT? I...

07:52.080 --> 07:53.380
I THINK I ATE THAT TOO FAST.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.329
I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.
I GOTTA GO HOME.

07:56.330 --> 07:57.620
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
DO THIS TO MYSELF.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.499
(humming happily)

08:04.500 --> 08:05.669
HI, GLORIA.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.289
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
WHILE JOE WASN'T HERE,

08:07.290 --> 08:11.459
THAT MAYBE WE COULD TAKE A FEW SECONDS
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED...

08:11.460 --> 08:12.499
LAST NIGHT.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.879
YES, WELL, YOUR FATHER
SAID HE RAN INTO YOU.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.380
(laughing) WHOO.

08:18.830 --> 08:21.079
OH, THAT RUSSELL BURKE.
HE IS AN AMAZING MAN.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.329
HE MADE ME FEEL SO ALIVE!

08:24.330 --> 08:26.249
I'M STILL TINGLING.

08:26.250 --> 08:29.170
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THAT TINGLING
CONTINUES, YOU MAY WANT TO SEE A DOCTOR.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.749
THERE I WAS, WALLOWING
IN MY SELF-PITY,

08:33.750 --> 08:35.289
FEELING MY LIFE WAS OVER.

08:35.290 --> 08:37.459
HE KNOCKED ON THE
DOOR, SWOOPED IN,

08:37.460 --> 08:38.999
AND PUMPED THE
LIFE BACK INTO ME!

08:39.000 --> 08:40.919
OKAY, UM...

08:40.920 --> 08:43.329
THAT BRINGS ME TO MY QUESTION.

08:43.330 --> 08:45.709
UM, WHEN ARE YOU PLANNING
TO TELL YOUR SON?

08:45.710 --> 08:47.379
NEVER.

08:47.380 --> 08:50.330
THREE CHILDREN, AND HE STILL
THINKS I'M THE VIRGIN MARY.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.249
GOOD MORNING, PUMPKIN,

08:54.250 --> 08:56.619
AND GOOD MORNING,
YOU LOVELY LADY.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.209
(giggling) RUSSELL, NO!

08:58.210 --> 09:00.039
JOEY COULD COME IN
HERE AND SEE US.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.039
WELL, IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR
LOOKING SO FETCHING.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.079
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

09:03.080 --> 09:07.119
OH, THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE
FOR ME ON SO MANY LEVELS.

09:07.120 --> 09:11.169
RUSSELL IS TAKING ME TO
THAT ZOO WITH THE HIPPOS.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.080
THE HIPPOQUARIUM.

09:13.710 --> 09:15.040
IT'S MATING SEASON.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.919
YEAH, APPARENTLY.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.459
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.619
OH, MORNING, JOSEPH.

09:24.620 --> 09:27.289
LISTEN, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, BUT I'M GONNA
TAKE YOUR MOTHER OUT FOR A LITTLE SIGHTSEEING.

09:27.290 --> 09:30.999
OH, YES! AND, TO CONTINUE TALKING
ABOUT THE ESTATE PLANNING.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.750
(giggling) AND THAT IS ALL.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.039
HEY, HEY, HEY, LISTEN,

09:37.040 --> 09:38.499
JUST REAL FAST.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.420
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
WHAT YOU DID TO MY MOTHER.

09:44.290 --> 09:48.329
I MEAN, APPARENTLY, YOU KNOW, YOU REACHED
HER IN A WAY I WAS NEVER ABLE TO.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.080
(spits)

09:51.920 --> 09:54.120
I CAN'T SAY YOU'RE
WRONG, JOSEPH.

10:00.540 --> 10:02.040
YOUR DAD DID
SOMETHING TO MY MOM.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.499
YOU CAN TELL?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.459
OH, YEAH.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.459
HE GAVE HER, UM...

10:08.460 --> 10:10.040
PEACE OF MIND.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.079
THE PEACE OF MIND THAT
ONLY COMES, HONEY,

10:14.080 --> 10:16.119
WHEN ALL YOUR AFFAIRS
ARE IN ORDER.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.879
MM-HMM.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.000
HMM. MM-HMM.

10:21.170 --> 10:22.419
ARE YOU KEEPING
SOMETHING FROM ME?

10:22.420 --> 10:23.999
- HMM?
- HEY, COME ON.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.169
WE PROMISED ALWAYS TO TELL
EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

10:26.170 --> 10:27.669
I MEAN, COME ON,

10:27.670 --> 10:29.169
WE CAN KEEP, LIKE, ONE LITTLE
THING FROM EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.170
ISN'T THAT EXCITING?

10:30.171 --> 10:33.000
I MEAN, DOESN'T THAT
KEEP THE MYSTERY ALIVE?

10:34.210 --> 10:35.959
COME ON! LET ME KEEP
THIS ONE THING FROM YOU?

10:35.960 --> 10:37.169
MEL!

10:37.170 --> 10:38.999
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.789
UM...

10:40.790 --> 10:45.579
LAST NIGHT WHEN MY FATHER WENT
UPSTAIRS TO SOOTHE YOUR MOTHER,

10:45.580 --> 10:47.379
HE...

10:47.380 --> 10:49.539
YOU KNOW,

10:49.540 --> 10:51.040
"SOOTHED" HER.

10:52.290 --> 10:55.829
YOU KNOW, IN THAT
PRIMAL, MASCULINE WAY

10:55.830 --> 10:58.750
THAT ONLY A MAN CAN
DO FOR A WOMAN?

11:00.080 --> 11:02.290
HE BOUGHT HER JEWELRY?

11:04.250 --> 11:06.879
JOE, THEY HAD SEX
WITH EACH OTHER!

11:06.880 --> 11:09.289
HA! WHAT?

11:09.290 --> 11:10.919
(laughing)

11:10.920 --> 11:14.249
HONEY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.880
MY MOTHER DOESN'T DO THAT.

11:17.830 --> 11:20.379
JOE, HASN'T IT BEEN, LIKE, 25
YEARS SINCE YOUR FATHER LEFT?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.459
YES, AND THAT'S THE ONLY
MAN SHE'S EVER BEEN WITH.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.919
HEY, LISTEN TO ME, MY
MOTHER IS A SAINT.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.749
JOE,

11:27.750 --> 11:30.829
YOU MOTHER IS THE
ONE THAT TOLD ME,

11:30.830 --> 11:33.250
AND THAT SAINT WOULDN'T
LIE, WOULD SHE?

11:39.120 --> 11:41.210
(sadly) NO.

11:45.380 --> 11:46.579
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:46.580 --> 11:48.209
ALL RIGHT.

11:48.210 --> 11:49.619
YEAH, I THINK I READ ABOUT THIS.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.670
THIS IS AN ANGER COMA.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.580
NO. NO, I'M UM...

11:59.210 --> 12:00.419
I'M FINE.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.540
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:04.040 --> 12:05.289
GOING FOR A LITTLE RUN.

12:05.290 --> 12:06.459
WHERE?

12:06.460 --> 12:08.080
CANADA.

12:11.710 --> 12:14.209
(yelling)

12:14.210 --> 12:16.709
- WHAT'S UP WITH JOE? -OH, YOU KNOW HIM.
HE GETS STRESSED.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.669
THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
AN UNSETTLING EVENT

12:18.670 --> 12:21.879
BETWEEN GLORIA AND
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.919
(gasps)

12:22.920 --> 12:25.079
GRANDPA AND JOE'S MOM HAD SEX?

12:25.080 --> 12:26.789
HOW DID YOU FIGURE
THAT OUT SO FAST?

12:26.790 --> 12:28.249
AND PLEASE, DON'T SAY
IT OUT LOUD AGAIN!

12:28.250 --> 12:31.079
OH, COME ON. THEY'RE
SINGLE, THEY'RE HAPPY.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.169
NOBODY GOT HURT. I
MEAN, GOOD FOR THEM.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.209
NO. NO. NO! NO, NOT
GOOD FOR THEM!

12:35.210 --> 12:36.499
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE GLORIA'S HEART

12:36.500 --> 12:38.579
IS GONNA BE SHATTERED
INTO A MILLION PIECES,

12:38.580 --> 12:40.459
BECAUSE MY DAD IS A PLAYER.
HE'S LIKE A PIRATE.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.579
HE INVADES A TOWN,
TAKES ITS BOOTY,

12:42.580 --> 12:44.420
AND THEN RELOADS THE CANNON
FOR THE NEXT CONQUEST.

12:45.710 --> 12:47.499
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
I THINK IT'S CUTE

12:47.500 --> 12:50.419
THAT YOUR DAD AND JOE'S MOM
CAN GET THEIR GRANDFREAK ON.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.960
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T
SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.079
YOU KNOW, I THINK MY
FAVORITE SCENE IN THE MOVIE

12:59.080 --> 13:00.879
WAS WEN GUNTER WENT
TO THE EMPTY CITY,

13:00.880 --> 13:03.209
AND REALIZED HE WAS
INSIDE HIS OWN SOUL.

13:03.210 --> 13:06.579
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ONLY SEE ONE
POSTMODERN, SWEDISH, FILM NOIR THIS YEAR,

13:06.580 --> 13:09.710
IT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE
TOM STAD, TOM SJAL, JA?

13:11.830 --> 13:14.209
HEY, UH, WANNA HANG OUT
HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.289
OH, UH, SURE.

13:16.290 --> 13:20.329
AND, YOU KNOW, SINCE WE DIDN'T GET TO
DO THE "SUPAH-FRIENDZ" THING LAST TIME,

13:20.330 --> 13:22.459
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE SOME OF
THE "SUPAH" PART RIGHT NOW?

13:22.460 --> 13:25.419
UH, EXCEPT THAT WE JUST
CAME BACK FROM A MOVIE.

13:25.420 --> 13:28.499
IF WE HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW, DOESN'T THAT MAKE
THIS WHOLE EVENING KIND OF LIKE A DATE?

13:28.500 --> 13:29.669
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT COUPLES DO.

13:29.670 --> 13:32.169
OH, DARN. YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:32.170 --> 13:34.829
UM, WELL, WHAT IF WE HAVE
A BRIEF WAITING PERIOD

13:34.830 --> 13:36.039
AND THEN HAVE SEX?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.749
(gasps) WHAT IF WE WAIT AN HOUR?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.079
LIKE BETWEEN EATING
AND SWIMMING?

13:39.080 --> 13:41.209
YEAH, GREAT.

13:41.210 --> 13:43.619
OH, EXCEPT I HAVE STUDY
GROUP IN AN HOUR.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.579
SO, WE'D EITHER HAVE TO HAVE SEX
RIGHT NOW OR WE CAN'T AT ALL.

13:46.580 --> 13:48.039
WELL, THEN OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.619
WELL...

13:49.620 --> 13:51.329
THANK YOU FOR
RESPECTING THE RULES

13:51.330 --> 13:52.420
AND RESPECTING ME.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.210
(giggling)

14:06.120 --> 14:07.709
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

14:07.710 --> 14:11.919
I'M THINKING THAT HIPPOPOTAMUS
HAD THE RIGHT IDEA.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.999
- HEY GUYS, WHAT'S UP?
- OH, NOTHING.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.249
RUSSELL WAS JUST
DROPPING ME OFF.

14:15.250 --> 14:18.039
HE REALLY SOLD ME ON THE
ESTATE PLANNING, TODAY.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.119
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.460
HAPPY TO HELP.

14:27.670 --> 14:29.919
WELL, I CAN SEE THAT
YOU'RE QUITE BUSY,

14:29.920 --> 14:31.119
SO I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.040
NOT SO FAST, RUSSELL.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.789
IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO
MY ATTENTION THAT, UM...

14:36.790 --> 14:39.000
YOU AND MY MOTHER
HAVE BECOME INTIMATE.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.459
WHAT'S HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND MY
MOTHER I KNOW MEANT A LOT TO HER,

14:45.460 --> 14:48.119
AND SHE'S GONNA EXPECT THAT
IT MEANT A LOT TO YOU, TOO.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.669
SO, I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO STEP UP
AND DO THE RIGHT THING BY HER.

14:51.670 --> 14:53.749
WELL, OF COURSE, SON.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.209
I'M GONNA CALL HER TOMORROW.
I'M NOT A COMPLETE CAD.

14:56.210 --> 14:59.289
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
(laughing)

14:59.290 --> 15:01.749
NO, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.460
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO MARRY HER.

15:06.380 --> 15:07.999
MARRY HER?

15:08.000 --> 15:11.249
YEAH. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS OLD SCHOOL,
BUT THAT'S HOW MY MOTHER IS.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.829
SHE IS NOT THE "HOOK UP" TYPE.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.499
TO BE HONEST,

15:15.500 --> 15:18.709
WHEN MEL FIRST ASKED ME TO
COME AND TALK TO YOUR MOTHER,

15:18.710 --> 15:20.999
I HAD ULTERIOR MOTIVES,

15:21.000 --> 15:22.579
BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER
HAS INTRIGUED ME

15:22.580 --> 15:25.289
FROM THE VERY FIRST
MOMENT SHE SNEERED AT ME.

15:25.290 --> 15:28.249
NOW, NORMALLY SOMETHING BRIEF

15:28.250 --> 15:31.249
AND PHYSICAL WOULD BE ALL
THAT I'D BE INTERESTED IN,

15:31.250 --> 15:32.539
BUT NOT WITH GLORIA.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.830
SHE'S CAPTURED MY HEART.

15:35.830 --> 15:38.669
MAYBE IT'S TIME I HAD A
SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP

15:38.670 --> 15:40.920
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.709
WOW.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.619
THIS IS AMAZING.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.539
I SWEAR MAN, I THOUGHT THERE
WAS LIKE AN 80% CHANCE

15:49.540 --> 15:50.789
I WAS GONNA HAVE TO MESS YOU UP.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.749
(laughing)

15:52.750 --> 15:55.000
OH GOD.

15:59.380 --> 16:00.709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SON?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.790
ALL THIS ADRENALINE HAS
TO GO SOMEWHERE, RUSSELL.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.039
MOM, WE NEED TO TALK.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.079
YEAH?

16:07.080 --> 16:08.499
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND RUSSELL.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.580
OH GOD, YOU KILLED HIM?

16:13.290 --> 16:15.079
NO, NO, MOM, MOM, I
DID NOT KILL HIM.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.499
IN FACT, WE HAD A VERY
GOOD CONVERSATION, MOM.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.169
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HE IS GONNA STEP
UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING BY YOU.

16:19.170 --> 16:21.379
WAIT A MINUTE, HE THINKS
YOU'RE FANTASTIC, MOM.

16:21.380 --> 16:25.079
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HE WANTS TO HAVE
A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

16:25.080 --> 16:28.119
SO, BOOK THE BANQUET ROOM
AT TRAVATO'S, MOMMY,

16:28.120 --> 16:30.619
BECAUSE I THINK THIS
COULD LEAD TO MARRIAGE!

16:30.620 --> 16:32.539
OH, GOD FORBID.

16:32.540 --> 16:33.579
WHAT?

16:33.580 --> 16:35.380
WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE
JUST KILLED HIM?

16:37.210 --> 16:39.249
NOW I'VE GOTTA GO
BREAK ANOTHER HEART!

16:39.250 --> 16:41.329
WHAT IS IT WITH MEN THESE DAYS?

16:41.330 --> 16:44.789
YOU SPEND ONE NIGHT WITH THEM, AND
THEN THEY START HEARING WEDDING BELLS.

16:44.790 --> 16:47.789
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:47.790 --> 16:48.879
SWEETHEART,

16:48.880 --> 16:52.379
I KNOW YOU THINK I'M
AS PURE AS A SAINT,

16:52.380 --> 16:55.000
BUT RUSSELL BURKE
WAS NOT THE FIRST.

16:56.210 --> 16:58.420
HE WASN'T EVEN THE
FIRST SENATOR.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.419
YOU'VE BEEN WITH OTHER MEN?

17:02.420 --> 17:06.169
JOEY, YOUR FATHER
LEFT 25 YEARS AGO!

17:06.170 --> 17:08.079
I'M A SEXUAL BEING!

17:08.080 --> 17:12.620
DID YOU REALLY THINK I WENT OUT AND
PLAYED CANASTA EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.170
YES!

17:17.460 --> 17:19.169
YES, I DID!

17:19.170 --> 17:21.209
OH,

17:21.210 --> 17:23.080
YOU'RE STILL MY LITTLE BOY.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.170
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO PLAY CANASTA.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.999
OH, UH, YOU'RE BACK.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.749
YEAH, I WAS ON MY WAY
HOME FROM MY STUDY GROUP

17:35.750 --> 17:37.669
AND I REALIZED, "HEY, IT'S
BEEN LIKE, THREE HOURS,

17:37.670 --> 17:39.879
"THAT SEEMS SAFELY IN
THE NOT-A-DATE ZONE,"

17:39.880 --> 17:42.580
SO I FIGURED WE COULD DO SOME
OF THE SUPAH-FRIENDZ THING NOW.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.789
ACTUALLY, UH, I WAS
JUST ON MY WAY OUT

17:45.790 --> 17:47.789
FOR A DATE WITH TANYA.

17:47.790 --> 17:50.079
THE GIRL FROM YOUR
SCULPTURE CLASS?

17:50.080 --> 17:53.419
YEAH. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE HERE NOW.

17:53.420 --> 17:56.289
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, THE THING
WITH TANYA WAS LAST MINUTE.

17:56.290 --> 17:58.419
SO, I'LL JUST, UH...
JUST RESCHEDULE HER.

17:58.420 --> 17:59.749
WELL, ONLY IF THAT'S
OKAY WITH YOU?

17:59.750 --> 18:02.579
YEAH. SO, UH...

18:02.580 --> 18:04.419
SHOULD WE...

18:04.420 --> 18:06.540
- OH, YEAH.
- OKAY.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.420
SO, YOU AND TANYA. YOU THINK
THAT COULD GO SOMEWHERE?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.919
I DON'T KNOW. WE'VE
NEVER GONE OUT BEFORE.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.960
- OH.
- YEAH.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.040
I MEAN, DO YOU LIKE HER?

18:22.460 --> 18:23.999
DON'T KNOW YET.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.249
THAT'S WHY I WAS GONNA
GO OUT WITH HER.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.250
- RIGHT.
- (both chuckle)

18:29.710 --> 18:32.039
OKAY, SO WHY ARE YOU SO
CURIOUS ABOUT TANYA, ANYWAYS?

18:32.040 --> 18:33.169
I'M NOT.

18:33.170 --> 18:35.079
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S OBSESSED WITH HER,

18:35.080 --> 18:37.170
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO AND BE WITH HER?

18:39.330 --> 18:42.579
WAIT A SECOND. I'M SENSING THAT
YOU MAY HAVE SOME FEELINGS

18:42.580 --> 18:45.119
THAT GO BEYOND THE
SUPAH-FRIENDZ AREA?

18:45.120 --> 18:46.749
UGH, I DON'T SEE
WHY THAT MATTERS?

18:46.750 --> 18:49.289
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S ALL CRAZY FOR TANYA.

18:49.290 --> 18:52.289
I WAS ONLY GONNA GO OUT WITH HER
BECAUSE I HAD NO CHANCE WITH YOU,

18:52.290 --> 18:54.119
AS PER THE SUPAH-FRIENDZ
AGREEMENT.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.459
BUT, IF YOU DO HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ME,

18:55.460 --> 18:57.539
THEN PFFT, TANYA.

18:57.540 --> 19:01.119
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I
HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU,

19:01.120 --> 19:03.499
UNLESS YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME?

19:03.500 --> 19:06.169
WELL, HOLD ON, ARE YOU
SAYING THAT YOU...

19:06.170 --> 19:07.210
YOU DO HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME?

19:09.210 --> 19:12.289
OKAY. ON THREE, LET'S SAY IF WE
HAVE FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER.

19:12.290 --> 19:14.539
ONE, TWO, THREE.

19:14.540 --> 19:16.170
- YES.
- FEELINGS.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.210
I WASN'T SURE HOW TO RESPOND.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.169
WELL THIS SUCKS.

19:22.170 --> 19:24.459
WE CAN'T BE SUPAH-FRIENDZ IF
THERE ARE FEELINGS INVOLVED.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.379
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET
TO THE BENEFITS.

19:26.380 --> 19:28.920
DUDE, WE SUCK AT
BEING SUPAH-FRIENDZ.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.919
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
GIVE UP AND BECOME...

19:33.920 --> 19:36.249
YOU KNOW, A COUPLE.

19:36.250 --> 19:39.210
UGH. YEAH, I REALLY DON'T
SEE ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE.

19:41.790 --> 19:43.289
YOU READY TO KISS
WITH FEELINGS NOW?

19:43.290 --> 19:44.499
LET'S SAY ON THREE.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.619
ONE, TWO...

19:45.620 --> 19:47.170
SHUT UP.

19:51.670 --> 19:53.289
"RUSSELL THANK YOU FOR
A WONDERFUL TIME.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.289
"WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE TOLEDO.
SINCERELY, GLORIA."

19:55.290 --> 19:57.379
A NOTE STUCK ON
OUR REFRIGERATOR?

19:57.380 --> 20:00.209
WELL, THAT'S A FITTING ENDING TO YOUR
WONDERFUL PLAN FOR A SHOTGUN WEDDING.

20:00.210 --> 20:02.499
HEY, IT'S A VERY
THOUGHTFUL NOTE.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.419
COME ON, SHE WROTE "SINCERELY."

20:04.420 --> 20:08.459
PLEASE, I'VE GOT REMINDERS FROM THE
DENTIST MORE EMOTIONAL THAN THIS.

20:08.460 --> 20:10.289
MY FATHER'S GONNA BE CRUSHED!

20:10.290 --> 20:12.499
YOU KNOW, AND SOMEBODY HAS TO
TELL HIM THAT HE'S BEEN DUMPED.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.999
NOT IT.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.619
WAIT A MINUTE, WHY
DO I HAVE TO DO IT?

20:15.620 --> 20:17.499
UH, BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER'S
THE ONE THAT DID THIS.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.170
SHE'S THE ONE THAT
HIT IT AND QUIT IT.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.119
HE'S YOUR FATHER.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.119
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE FORGETTING
ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING...

20:24.120 --> 20:26.419
I DON'T WANNA!

20:26.420 --> 20:28.959
(knocks) DING-DONG.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.789
SO, IS GLORIA READY?

20:30.790 --> 20:32.419
DAD, THERE'S, UH...

20:32.420 --> 20:33.959
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

20:33.960 --> 20:38.039
ACTUALLY, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
BOTH OF US HAVE TO TELL YOU.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.249
GLORIA'S DUMPING ME?

20:40.250 --> 20:41.289
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

20:41.290 --> 20:44.380
(sadly) I JUST READ
JOEY'S SWEATER.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.289
DAD, I'M GOING TO
THE GROCERY STORE,

20:52.290 --> 20:53.080
YOU NEED ANYTHING?

20:53.081 --> 20:54.880
A LITTLE MORE ICE CREAM...

20:56.170 --> 20:57.419
(crying) AND A HUG.

20:57.420 --> 20:58.829
AWW.

20:58.830 --> 20:59.919
COME HERE.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.040
NO, NOT YOU.

21:02.790 --> 21:04.959
I NEED A LONGO HUG.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.120
JOSEPH!

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
(mouths)

21:15.580 --> 21:16.829
ALL RIGHT.

21:16.830 --> 21:18.539
OKAY. THERE WE GO.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.209
(whimpers)

21:20.210 --> 21:21.789
THANK YOU.

21:21.790 --> 21:22.920
YUP. NOT A PROBLEM.
