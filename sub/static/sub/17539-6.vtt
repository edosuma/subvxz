(chuckles)
Well, well, well,

00:19.478 --> 00:22.105
the famous
Auradonian kids.

00:22.105 --> 00:25.234
Okay, Freddie,
retract your claws.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.985
But I just
had them sharpened.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.239
‐(gasp)
‐She's joking... I think.

00:30.239 --> 00:33.450
Aww, look at these two.
They're adorable.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.660
It's sickening.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.954
Hey, you can't talk
to us like that.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.915
And what, pray tell,
are you gonna do about it?

00:39.915 --> 00:42.834
I'll... I'll... I'll...

00:44.294 --> 00:46.421
‐Thought so.
‐When I throw a party,

00:46.421 --> 00:48.632
I‐‐ I won't invite you.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.885
(laughs)

00:57.808 --> 01:00.435
We really need to
teach them how to
smack talk.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.313
Do you remember the
"your mama" battles
that we used to have?

01:03.313 --> 01:07.109
Your mama's so weak,
old ladies help her
across the street.

01:07.109 --> 01:11.154
Your mama's so weak,
instead of poison apples,
she makes apple pie.

01:11.154 --> 01:15.367
Your mama's so soft,
the only spells she casts
are crying spells.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.161
Your mama's so soft,
cats share pictures of her.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.663
Oh snap.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.123
(both laugh)

01:21.123 --> 01:24.835
Yo mama's so soft,
she's... like... a pillow.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.628
Well, what do you know,

01:26.628 --> 01:29.214
these guys are
even more lame
than I imagined.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.550
Okay, we may not frown
and wear black,

01:31.550 --> 01:32.718
but we are not lame.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.220
‐Yeah.
‐We can be rotten
just like you guys.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.763
Yeah!

01:36.763 --> 01:37.848
We can?

01:37.848 --> 01:39.182
Uh, yeah.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.184
Check this out.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.519
‐(shatters)
‐(gasp)

01:42.519 --> 01:44.521
(gasp)
What have I done?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.898
Let me help!
Anyone got glue?

01:46.898 --> 01:48.859
Ben:
Uh, I'd be happy to
pay for damages.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.610
Watching them do this
is worse than

01:50.610 --> 01:52.696
any punishment
my mother ever gave me.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.198
Oh, yeah. We have got to
get them out of here

01:55.198 --> 01:56.450
before anyone else
shows up.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.201
Audrey:
Are we going to jail?

01:58.201 --> 01:59.995
‐(creaking)
‐(gasp)

01:59.995 --> 02:01.288
You gotta hide.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.373
I don't want them to know
you're here, too.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.791
I don't even know
how we got here.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.294
I mean, one moment
I was rubbing paint
off Jordan's lamp,

02:07.294 --> 02:10.380
and then the next‐‐
That's it! The lamp!

02:10.380 --> 02:13.008
(sigh) I just wish
we could ask her how we...

02:16.345 --> 02:18.180
(Southern accent)
Then, my precious darlings,

02:18.180 --> 02:21.141
you just take
two pinches of sugar...

02:23.226 --> 02:25.687
(nervous laugh) Hi.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.856
(chuckles)
Is this a bad time?

02:27.856 --> 02:29.107
