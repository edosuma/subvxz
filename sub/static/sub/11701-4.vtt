WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:01.460
Nice color.

00:01.859 --> 00:03.020
Your hair.

00:03.140 --> 00:04.140
Do it yourself?

00:04.220 --> 00:05.460
I'm a hairdresser.

00:05.780 --> 00:08.140
- So, what's your name?
- Debbie.

00:08.380 --> 00:10.380
I'm Brayden. Brayden Holt.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.700
You, young lady at the desk.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.620
The dog has detected an illegal substance.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.460
- We're gonna have to do a strip search.
- What?

00:16.620 --> 00:18.060
She's just 16, for Christ's sake!

00:18.140 --> 00:19.500
- I'm not gonna let them touch her!
- Bea!

00:19.580 --> 00:21.580
She was wearing it the day
she died. She always wore it.

00:21.660 --> 00:23.820
Okay, whoever killed
Meg took that bracelet.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.220
Who the fuck has been
going through my stuff?

00:28.580 --> 00:30.020
23 Cromwell Avenue.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.140
That's where she lives,
doesn't she? Young Debbie.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.100
I knew this girl once.

00:34.180 --> 00:35.540
Hit and run.

00:35.780 --> 00:36.780
What do you want?

00:37.340 --> 00:38.980
Get the fuck off me!

00:39.060 --> 00:40.140
All right, Bea.

00:40.220 --> 00:41.380
Do the honors.

00:46.740 --> 00:47.740
I had no choice, Jacs,

00:47.820 --> 00:49.100
she was threatening my daughter.

00:49.180 --> 00:51.260
I don't give a shit about your family.

00:51.820 --> 00:54.540
If you're stupid enough to keep them
in your life, then that's your problem.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.020 --> 01:46.660
I'd like to welcome everyone today

01:46.740 --> 01:49.380
to hear all of us talk about our journey.

01:50.620 --> 01:53.140
There's been a few people
in my life who have tried to push me.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.660
Never worked out too well.

01:55.980 --> 01:56.980
For them.

01:57.060 --> 01:58.300
I know most people would think

01:58.380 --> 02:00.580
being in here is the worst
thing that could happen.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.500
It's gonna sound a bit crazy, but

02:03.100 --> 02:05.420
for me, it's the best thing.

02:06.340 --> 02:10.900
I knocked a few heads together.

02:11.420 --> 02:12.820
Got to know the slot real well.

02:14.100 --> 02:17.740
The thing I'm most proud
about is the peer worker program.

02:17.940 --> 02:21.420
I remember when I first came
here, there was nothing like it.

02:22.580 --> 02:26.460
And just quietly, I got
a real buzz out of passing my HSC.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.860
I'm sure you'll all
keep that to yourselves.

02:30.740 --> 02:32.700
Outside, my life was a mess.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.460
And I hurt a lot of people.

02:34.540 --> 02:37.860
But then, Franky taught
me this trick and it works,

02:38.300 --> 02:41.180
most of the time. And it
stopped me from going bunta.

02:42.180 --> 02:44.420
It's helped me as
much as the other women.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.380
And the women really listen to me.

02:48.180 --> 02:49.900
After six years,

02:51.020 --> 02:52.300
things have changed.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.100
And I finally have a family.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.140
And it's all because of one person.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.580
I haven't been in
the slot for over six months.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.060
The Governor might have
organized this event but it's...

03:02.500 --> 03:04.340
It's us women that made it happen.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.180
I've changed.

03:07.260 --> 03:08.540
I've changed.

03:10.820 --> 03:11.860
I've changed.

03:19.180 --> 03:22.300
So, I want everyone to be clear
about how things will run today.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.500
Liz has organized the women.

03:24.820 --> 03:27.580
The women have been instructed
about what they can speak about.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.660
You're putting a lot of trust in Liz.

03:29.740 --> 03:33.540
Well, like the women, Liz is aware
of how important today is to everyone.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.380
Including you.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.100
No, to all of us.

03:37.460 --> 03:40.380
I mean, this is our chance to show the
Department that we're making a difference

03:40.460 --> 03:43.220
in these women's lives and that they
have a real chance on the outside.

03:45.260 --> 03:48.020
Matt, you'll wrangle the women. Make
sure they stick to running order.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.660
Well, I'm not rostered.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.140
With the extra shifts
covering the wet cells

03:52.220 --> 03:53.980
and the slot last week, I think I'm done.

03:54.340 --> 03:57.020
Fine. Well, okay. Linda,
you'll take his place.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.940
For all of those who are rostered,

04:00.020 --> 04:02.740
you can mention the increased
numbers in my programs,

04:03.540 --> 04:04.980
the improved conditions for the women.

04:05.260 --> 04:07.140
But not the pressure it puts on officers.

04:07.820 --> 04:10.860
As there is still an
ongoing police investigation,

04:10.940 --> 04:12.540
we will not mention the riot.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.340
Anything you'd like to add?

04:18.100 --> 04:20.380
So we're all clear? Thank you.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.860
Will?

04:28.460 --> 04:31.340
Er, is there anything new
with the investigation?

04:31.900 --> 04:33.140
I haven't heard anything.

04:33.580 --> 04:36.740
Every time I ask, the cops give
me the same bullshit answer.

04:37.940 --> 04:38.980
"No new leads."

04:39.260 --> 04:41.700
Yeah, it's... Well, none
of the women are speaking.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.380
There's no standout suspects.

04:44.620 --> 04:45.740
Makes your life easier.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.740
Takes the heat off. Especially with today.

04:49.380 --> 04:51.900
Well, no. I want to know what
happened to Meg. We all do.

04:52.780 --> 04:54.700
And if I hear of anything,
I'll let you know.

04:56.060 --> 04:59.620
Look, all you can do is just let the
police work through their investigation.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.180
You all right?

05:14.340 --> 05:15.500
Mum's gonna freak.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.220
She'll be fine.

05:17.540 --> 05:19.300
She said on the phone to stay away.

05:20.060 --> 05:23.020
She probably just reckons after the
last time you'd wig out coming back.

05:26.020 --> 05:29.180
- I dunno. I can't do this.
- Hey, it's not gonna happen again.

05:31.780 --> 05:34.420
- And you wanna see her.
- Yeah.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.660
Well, let's go.

05:42.780 --> 05:46.260
Hey, come on, love. Not long now, eh?

05:48.260 --> 05:50.020
- Liz, nice to see you again.
- Hi, Rachel.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.420
Hi, Rachel. Um, I'll be back in an hour.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.380
And how have you
been since we last met?

05:55.540 --> 05:57.140
- You all right?
- Yeah.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.500
- Oh, um, good. Yeah, busy, busy.
- Yeah.

06:01.220 --> 06:02.580
Yeah, I've, um,

06:02.900 --> 06:05.260
been helping the Governor,
we've got this big event today.

06:05.340 --> 06:09.060
And, uh, she thinks I've got a
better chance of getting the women to

06:09.420 --> 06:11.860
open up and talk about
themselves more than she does.

06:11.940 --> 06:15.180
Well, that's something I can put in
the report for your parole hearing.

06:15.860 --> 06:19.020
Mrs. Jackson put in a
request a couple of months ago

06:19.100 --> 06:20.260
and it's been approved.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.740
Your parole hearing's in two weeks' time.

06:24.420 --> 06:25.460
That soon?

06:25.980 --> 06:27.580
We'll have time to prepare everything.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.380
Right.

06:31.780 --> 06:34.060
Now, do you know where you'll be staying

06:34.140 --> 06:35.300
once you're released?

06:35.380 --> 06:37.020
Can I give you a cuddle?

06:37.780 --> 06:40.540
Whoo! I love you.

06:41.580 --> 06:42.740
Liz?

06:44.700 --> 06:47.820
Um, well, I
haven't made parole yet.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.060
Well, I'll have to set up
appointments and meetings and

06:51.420 --> 06:53.220
it'll all be in the report, but

06:53.420 --> 06:56.900
I can't do that until I
know where you'll be staying

06:57.260 --> 07:00.180
and what sort of support system
you'll have on the outside.

07:00.740 --> 07:01.740
Right.

07:02.020 --> 07:04.180
I thought we agreed you'd
stay away for a while.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.220
I know, it's just too
hard to talk on the phone.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.180
Yeah, but it's just for a while,

07:08.260 --> 07:10.500
and just after everything that
happened last time you were here...

07:10.940 --> 07:13.100
I just wanted to see you.
What's so wrong with that?

07:16.220 --> 07:18.060
- I didn't get searched.
- Good.

07:18.460 --> 07:19.460
Good.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.980
Sorry. It's great to see you.

07:23.820 --> 07:26.820
Now, the last time you
appeared before the board,

07:28.020 --> 07:30.420
they expressed some concern about

07:30.700 --> 07:33.300
how you would cope with
life on the outside.

07:34.420 --> 07:35.500
With your drinking.

07:43.420 --> 07:46.060
Well, I haven't had a drink for 18 months.

07:47.420 --> 07:48.540
You need a support system

07:48.620 --> 07:50.580
- that's not just AA meetings.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:50.660 --> 07:51.660
And counseling.

07:51.940 --> 07:53.540
You really need your family.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.420
You don't have to worry about
that. You know, I'll get on to it.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.940
- So, how's everything at home?
- Dad's...

08:08.060 --> 08:10.940
Dad, he hasn't actually been around much.

08:11.780 --> 08:12.780
Really?

08:15.620 --> 08:17.780
And school? How are your exams going?

08:17.900 --> 08:20.420
- I get my results back in a few weeks.
- Good.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.020
Mum?

08:25.100 --> 08:26.300
How'd you get here today?

08:27.060 --> 08:28.220
I caught the bus.

08:29.380 --> 08:31.460
Listen, I want you to be really careful.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.140
All right? I don't want you going
out by yourself, especially at night.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.059
And if anyone comes up to
you and you don't know them,

08:36.140 --> 08:37.900
I want you to find somewhere safe.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.220
Do you think something's
gonna happen to me?

08:42.860 --> 08:45.420
I just... Some of the women in here might

08:45.900 --> 08:47.100
use you to get to me.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.300
Well, you can't expect me
to sit at home all the time.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.140
I can't protect you while I'm in here.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.100
I'm not gonna have no life because you are.

08:56.580 --> 08:57.740
I need to pee.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.540
No smiles today for Mummy?

09:01.820 --> 09:02.980
I want you to come home.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.220
You know I will soon, baby. I miss you.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.620
Do you need to go to the toilet?

09:07.340 --> 09:08.380
I think you do.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.300
Come on. Go with Auntie
Manda to the toilet.

09:11.620 --> 09:12.780
- I don't want to.
- Come on.

09:12.860 --> 09:15.420
Do as Auntie Manda says, please.
Come on honey, I love you.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.260
Good girl.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.780
Come, love. You know what
to do. Sit on the toilet.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.580
- I can't go.
- You've had your chocolates.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.340
- Come on.
- I didn't eat it.

09:28.980 --> 09:30.980
- Are you fibbing me?
- It hurts when I go.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.700
I don't want the chocolate anymore.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.460
Shit! Come on. We're leaving.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.420
Ronnie, she didn't eat the chocolate.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.020
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.820
- I gave it to her in the car.
- Mum...

09:44.900 --> 09:46.500
She ate it about 45 minutes ago.

09:48.140 --> 09:49.540
Oh, my God! Fuck!

09:49.820 --> 09:51.300
Oh, my God! Amy! Amy!

09:51.380 --> 09:52.860
Come on, Amy.

09:53.580 --> 09:54.580
What happened?

09:54.780 --> 09:55.900
Somebody fucking help her!

09:55.980 --> 09:57.460
- What happened?
- She just collapsed.

09:57.980 --> 09:59.380
- Code black.
- Is she gonna be all right?

09:59.460 --> 10:01.260
Mum, Mum,
something's wrong with Artie.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.260
- What do you mean?
- He's lying on the floor.

10:03.580 --> 10:05.940
- He drank out of this bottle.
- Artie? Artie?

10:08.420 --> 10:10.740
Artie? Ollie?

10:10.980 --> 10:12.660
- Out of the way, Ronnie. Move away.
- Okay, out the way.

10:12.740 --> 10:13.820
Move away, Ronnie.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.100
Is she gonna be all right?

10:15.500 --> 10:17.100
- Code black.
- Mum, what's wrong with her?

10:17.180 --> 10:19.180
Everyone clear the room. Quickly!

10:20.060 --> 10:22.060
- I want to speak to my mum.
- I love you, Deb, I love you.

10:22.140 --> 10:23.220
Check the airway.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.220
- What happened, Ronnie?
- I don't know. I don't know.

10:26.700 --> 10:29.060
Amy? If you don't tell
us, we can't help you.

10:29.140 --> 10:30.740
She's unconscious. She could die.

10:30.820 --> 10:32.660
She's supposed to shit it out!
She's supposed to shit it out!

10:32.740 --> 10:34.700
- Shit what out?
- Come on, Ronnie.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.460
- The gear.
- Yes. Heroin?

10:37.140 --> 10:39.100
Yes. Yes.

10:39.580 --> 10:40.820
- Get her out.
- No, I don't want to go.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.060
- Come on.
- No! No! No!

10:42.140 --> 10:43.140
Get her out of here!

10:43.220 --> 10:45.460
Let me go! Amy!

10:45.540 --> 10:47.820
- I will look after her.
- Amy!

10:48.180 --> 10:50.380
Four, five, six, seven...

10:51.380 --> 10:53.100
How could anyone do that to their own kid?

10:53.180 --> 10:55.620
- Oh, my God!
- He's got a pulse. He's got a pulse.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.780
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Booze.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.980
God, I'm just... Get the ambulance!

11:00.460 --> 11:01.780
It'll be all right. Don't you worry.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.940
I need an ambulance. It's my son.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.780
- It's okay.
- Er, he's five.

11:06.740 --> 11:09.340
- We think it's er...
- I'm sorry.

11:09.780 --> 11:12.380
- Yeah, it's alcohol poisoning.
- I'm sorry.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.940
He drank it by mistake. It
was in a soft drink bottle.

11:16.700 --> 11:17.820
- Liz?
- Hmm?

11:18.100 --> 11:19.100
What?

11:19.700 --> 11:21.140
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.140
Yeah.

11:25.260 --> 11:26.260
Can it get any worse?

11:26.540 --> 11:27.580
Another death in the prison?

11:27.660 --> 11:28.740
A child? After Meg's?

11:28.820 --> 11:31.180
You know, I'm thinking we
shouldn't go ahead with the event.

11:31.380 --> 11:32.500
We're not canceling.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.860
There are a lot of mothers
inside, they're gonna be furious.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.500
Today is gonna be a difficult time
to put them under any pressure.

11:37.580 --> 11:39.820
If we cancel, then we'll
be the ones under pressure.

11:40.140 --> 11:41.620
Okay, well, what about Jacs and Franky?

11:41.700 --> 11:43.020
This could set thing
off between them again.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.260
You're the Governor,
keep them under control.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.660
Look, you're the one pushing this event.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.340
Postponing for a couple of weeks
isn't gonna change anything.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.940
But it will raise questions and
I'm not prepared to answer them.

11:51.020 --> 11:52.300
Sort out your women, Erica.

11:52.380 --> 11:54.020
The Department will walk out of here today

11:54.300 --> 11:57.220
smiles on their faces, their
boss with a boot up their ass.

12:02.780 --> 12:04.100
I hated Debbie seeing that.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.900
I never got a chance to
say goodbye properly either.

12:09.740 --> 12:12.100
- Are you sure you're okay?
- No, don't feel sorry for me.

12:13.060 --> 12:15.020
That little girl could die.

12:16.340 --> 12:18.700
I didn't think even Jacs would go that far,

12:18.780 --> 12:20.660
to use that kid to bring in drugs.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.460
- Hold on. Jacs?
- Oh, yeah.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.300
She calls the shots and Ronnie,
she just does what she's told.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.580
It'll be Ronnie who cops it in the neck.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.660
There's women in here, they
don't tolerate kids being used.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.740
So, what will they do to her?

12:33.380 --> 12:36.540
If her kid dies, she could, too.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.620
What? And Jacs gets away with it?

13:01.980 --> 13:05.340
Piss off!

13:05.420 --> 13:08.420
- Bitch!
- We hate you, Ronnie!

13:34.060 --> 13:35.180
Jacs?

13:36.260 --> 13:37.300
May I come in?

13:37.540 --> 13:39.820
A visit from the Governor.
Now, isn't this special?

13:44.900 --> 13:46.420
Vinnie was released this morning.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.660
Good to see you keeping
up with current events.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.620
I organized for him to
come visit you today.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.420
With everything going
on with your big event,

13:54.500 --> 13:55.780
I didn't think you'd find time for me.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.220
Can't be seen playing favorites.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.460
No, you can't.

13:59.660 --> 14:02.220
I'll organize an officer to
escort you when he arrives.

14:02.580 --> 14:03.700
Thank you, Governor.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.940
If there are any further incidences
today, your visit's canceled.

14:11.020 --> 14:12.620
I'll be on my best behavior.

14:18.780 --> 14:21.940
Oh! I thought the women
would tear Ronnie apart.

14:22.140 --> 14:25.020
But it would've been Jacs who
gave her the order to do it.

14:25.340 --> 14:27.100
You're lucky Jacs didn't use Debbie.

14:29.380 --> 14:30.380
This time.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.380
Ronnie's got to live with what she did.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.700
Someone's got to teach
that old bag a lesson.

14:35.780 --> 14:37.340
Are you gonna stick your neck out?

14:37.740 --> 14:39.060
Yeah, thought not.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.100
Big day today, girls.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.020
Jacs gets her man back.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.500
I knew those pricks wouldn't be
able to make the charges stick.

14:49.860 --> 14:51.620
You sure he didn't turn on the inside?

14:52.540 --> 14:54.500
Probably the best fuck
he's had in his life.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.580
Keeping a healthy distance,
Francesca. That's good.

15:00.220 --> 15:02.660
I'm sure he's looking forward
to it as much as you are.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.140
Of course he is.

15:09.820 --> 15:10.900
Problem?

15:19.260 --> 15:20.980
- Well?
- Nothing.

15:21.060 --> 15:22.340
We were just talking about Ronnie.

15:23.060 --> 15:24.820
Yeah. We're one down today.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.780
So let's get on with it.

15:30.940 --> 15:34.060
Bea, come and see me later.

15:34.540 --> 15:35.780
Got a little job for you.

15:41.420 --> 15:44.100
So I've got to go and see
her. Do I have to go by myself?

15:44.220 --> 15:46.100
Franky's not gonna
protect you, is she?

15:46.180 --> 15:47.220
Well, can't I get out of it?

15:48.260 --> 15:49.940
- Franky?
- I'm reading.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.700
Jacs has put Bea in a no-win situation.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.100
She wasn't the one with
her hand in the steam press.

15:59.980 --> 16:01.140
She made a choice.

16:02.380 --> 16:04.780
Liz told me what they do to
women in here who hurt kids.

16:04.860 --> 16:07.460
And Jacs is threatening my daughter.
Can't you do something about that?

16:07.540 --> 16:09.380
Normal rules don't apply to Jacs.

16:09.460 --> 16:10.820
Yeah. Your daughter's fucked.

16:13.220 --> 16:14.500
Or you are.

16:17.460 --> 16:18.820
Either way, one of you is.

16:24.340 --> 16:25.820
Mr. Jackson.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.580
Making house calls?

16:28.420 --> 16:30.500
- How's the hand?
- It's fine.

16:30.860 --> 16:34.220
You know, if you're nicer to the officers,
these accidents wouldn't happen, Franky.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.860
Are you volunteering?

16:38.780 --> 16:41.460
For a price. Information.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.300
It must be frustrating not knowing.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.460
You didn't find anything
in my room, did you?

16:48.540 --> 16:50.580
Just tell me what you know about the riot.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.380
Which one of you guys killed my wife?

16:58.580 --> 17:00.060
What makes you think it was one of us?

17:09.060 --> 17:11.020
And how are the women
doing after this morning?

17:11.500 --> 17:13.819
Well, they hate it when
a kid's used like that.

17:14.180 --> 17:16.780
Of course. Just take a
seat anywhere you like.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.900
You know, I see today as an opportunity

17:19.980 --> 17:21.220
to take everyone's mind off it.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.220
This is something positive.

17:26.180 --> 17:27.660
What about Franky, is she still on board?

17:27.780 --> 17:30.340
I mean, she's the one drawing the crowd.

17:33.340 --> 17:35.660
- You said she'd speak, Liz.
- She changed her mind.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.060
Come on.

17:41.740 --> 17:44.540
Well, you focus on the other
women. Make sure they're ready.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.020
- Have they been practicing?
- Yeah.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.500
This is a chance for you to show the VIPs

17:48.860 --> 17:50.460
all the positive changes
you've been making,

17:50.540 --> 17:53.380
that you've got something to give
back to society when you're released.

17:54.260 --> 17:55.340
Have you finished your speech?

17:55.540 --> 17:56.620
I've started.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.700
But I've just been so busy
organizing everybody else.

18:00.460 --> 18:03.580
No, I haven't. No. I haven't finished mine.

18:03.860 --> 18:05.340
You said you'd speak, Liz.

18:08.660 --> 18:10.500
I don't like it when you go all funny.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.260
I know, Artie.

18:13.180 --> 18:15.820
And I'm going to try my very best, okay?

18:16.300 --> 18:19.100
I promise that I'm not
going to drink anymore.

18:19.220 --> 18:22.020
And I'm going to be the
best mum that I can be.

18:22.980 --> 18:26.020
- You promise you'll stop?
- Yes, Soph.

18:27.220 --> 18:28.580
Because I don't want to hurt you anymore.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.860
And we'll do everything we
can to help, won't we, kids?

18:32.140 --> 18:33.140
Yes.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.940
I was thinking, um, Celeste,

18:36.060 --> 18:37.420
you know how your birthday's coming up.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.140
Maybe I could help organize the party.

18:40.260 --> 18:41.260
I'd love that, Liz.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.980
I don't think that's a good idea.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.540
You don't need me up there.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.060
Oh, it's not gonna look very good

18:48.140 --> 18:51.020
if the woman who organized the
event doesn't get up and speak at it.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.260
Yeah, it's...

18:54.620 --> 18:56.300
I want it to go really well.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.180
I've booked the caterers and, um,

18:59.580 --> 19:01.340
I've ordered the flowers.

19:01.420 --> 19:03.260
I didn't know what to do about the music.

19:03.380 --> 19:06.300
Do you want a band or a DJ or...

19:06.460 --> 19:08.460
I'll be happy with whatever you choose.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.580
Yeah, but it's not my party, Celeste.

19:11.900 --> 19:15.220
Oh, Liz, come on.

19:15.740 --> 19:17.740
You're doing a great job.

19:19.580 --> 19:20.820
See you inside.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.660
I believe in you, Liz.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.660
I mean, you initiated
the peer worker program.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.700
This is your time to show everyone
what a success story you are.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.100
That's everything
from the day before the riot.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.860
Don't know what you expected to find, mate.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.100
The Governor's due here soon.
You'd better get a move on, mate.

19:54.620 --> 19:55.620
All right?

19:59.460 --> 20:01.100
Did you hear what
happened in Visitors this morning?

20:02.260 --> 20:04.340
A little
kid was used as a pack mule.

20:05.660 --> 20:07.100
A little girl, she was.

20:07.860 --> 20:09.660
Couldn't have been older than nine or 10.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.060
They should bring back the death penalty

20:12.140 --> 20:13.460
for scum like that.

20:18.140 --> 20:19.740
That's the trouble with
people in charge these days...

20:20.060 --> 20:21.660
- I want a copy of it.
- No.

20:21.740 --> 20:23.820
I'll pay you for it.

20:24.020 --> 20:26.380
- Yeah, and I'll get the ass.
- No one will know.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.940
And if they do, I'll wear it.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.220
Take it. It's all I've got on me.

20:45.340 --> 20:46.420
Franky.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.220
I'm popular today.

20:51.140 --> 20:53.500
I'd like you to speak today
at the Our Journey event.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.500
Well, I told Liz I wasn't interested.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.060
I thought it'd be right up your alley.

20:59.820 --> 21:00.820
I kind of look sketchy.

21:01.940 --> 21:04.100
No one cares how you look, they
just want to hear you speak.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.500
Well, I'm hurt. Don't you care?

21:12.700 --> 21:14.140
You haven't said the magic word.

21:16.260 --> 21:17.460
I can always ask Jacs.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.700
I thought you wanted it to be a success.

21:19.780 --> 21:20.980
That's why I'm asking you.

21:25.460 --> 21:26.460
Please.

21:27.660 --> 21:30.260
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?

21:31.620 --> 21:32.620
I'm in.

21:38.940 --> 21:39.940
Shit!

21:45.220 --> 21:47.020
Oh, God! It stinks.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.820
Yeah, it's meant to. It's fermenting.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.380
Oh! No, no.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.380
No, not until after the speeches.

21:52.460 --> 21:53.460
I need a bit of Dutch.

21:53.540 --> 21:56.460
No. I don't think I can get
through this without some.

21:56.540 --> 21:57.660
What, you think after this morning,

21:57.740 --> 22:00.380
I don't want a bit of something?
I want to, but I'm not gonna.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.820
You'll be right at the
thing. You'll be right.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.660
- No, I won't.
- You will.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.340
Listen, listen. Look at me.

22:06.940 --> 22:09.620
Every time I talk, I open
my mouth, people laugh.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.180
- No, they don't, Boomer.
- They do.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.060
- You bloody idiots!
- Oh!

22:13.220 --> 22:15.940
Oh, Liz, I thought you
were a screw.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.380
Oh, ha-ha.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.740
How long has this been going on?

22:19.020 --> 22:20.060
Boomer just showed me.

22:20.140 --> 22:21.140
Oh, yeah?

22:21.220 --> 22:22.580
Could we break it out
tonight after the speeches?

22:22.660 --> 22:24.540
Oh right, you're supposed be
practicing your bloody speech,

22:24.620 --> 22:26.140
not mucking around with home brew!

22:26.220 --> 22:28.180
- Yeah, all right.
- Think of all the dogs through the unit.

22:28.860 --> 22:30.860
- I just want to check.
- No!

22:31.500 --> 22:33.460
Hey! Don't you touch it.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.140
Come on, Booms.

22:37.580 --> 22:38.700
- Go!
- You don't understand me.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.700
Oh...

22:44.260 --> 22:45.380
You written your speech?

22:45.780 --> 22:46.980
- No.
- Why not?

22:47.660 --> 22:49.340
What, don't you want to
impress the parole board?

22:49.420 --> 22:51.140
I don't need to impress anyone, Dor.

22:51.260 --> 22:52.260
Why?

22:52.340 --> 22:54.220
Can you just go and practice your speech?

22:54.300 --> 22:55.460
Jeez! All right.

22:55.780 --> 22:56.860
See you later.

23:03.420 --> 23:05.820
- Oh, Liz, it's looking beautiful.
- No, no, no.

23:06.020 --> 23:07.260
It's too busy.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.300
And I love my scarf. Thank you.

23:09.380 --> 23:10.420
Does it go with the outfit?

23:10.500 --> 23:12.020
I don't know. I don't care.

23:12.220 --> 23:14.620
Well, your friends will.
They'll be here in a minute

23:14.740 --> 23:17.380
in their fancy cars and their designer duds

23:17.500 --> 23:19.220
and they'll want everything to be perfect.

23:19.300 --> 23:20.460
And it will be.

23:20.740 --> 23:22.420
I think I need a smaller vase here.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.700
It's so windy today, everything's a mess.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.740
Look, why don't I get Oliver
to bring down another table?

23:27.820 --> 23:29.500
No, I want everything together.

23:29.580 --> 23:31.460
All right. All right. I
was just trying to help.

23:31.860 --> 23:33.700
Why? You don't think I can do it.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.460
- Of course I do.
- I knew it!

23:35.540 --> 23:37.260
I knew you'd have a go, Celeste!

23:38.100 --> 23:40.180
God! Oh, I just...

24:04.500 --> 24:05.620
Don't do this today.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.020
You promised Mum. The kids.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.020
It's just a mouthful to
take the edge off, right?

24:10.140 --> 24:13.420
Because you have no idea
what I'm going through.

24:14.060 --> 24:15.620
And I am trying.

24:15.860 --> 24:18.140
If you really loved us, you wouldn't drink.

24:23.220 --> 24:24.620
You know I love you and the kids.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.780
First sign of stress, you
reach for the bloody bottle.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.140
For once in your life,

24:30.940 --> 24:32.340
don't stuff up.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.220
Yeah.

24:42.340 --> 24:45.940
Uh-huh. Um, thank you.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.340
I'll inform the mother.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.780
The child's gonna be okay.

24:53.140 --> 24:55.620
I'd like you to get that information
to the women as soon as possible.

24:57.140 --> 25:00.580
Obviously, Ronnie will be in
protection for the rest of her sentence.

25:01.220 --> 25:03.580
- And today is still going ahead.
- You've got to be kidding.

25:03.660 --> 25:04.900
I'd like to remind you all that

25:04.980 --> 25:07.540
under no circumstance are you to
mention the incident this morning.

25:07.860 --> 25:10.500
Yeah, that would definitely put
a damper on things, wouldn't it?

25:10.900 --> 25:12.740
But you're not gonna be here,
so why don't you shut up?

25:12.940 --> 25:13.940
Since when have you been on board

25:14.020 --> 25:15.220
- with this bleeding heart bullshit?
- Matt...

25:15.300 --> 25:17.460
- I'm voicing what everyone thinks.
- Yeah, well, enough.

25:17.780 --> 25:20.820
As an ex-army member you understand
the concept of taking an order.

25:21.380 --> 25:22.540
That's an order.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.020
Thank you.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.860
Vera, can I speak to you for a minute?

25:32.140 --> 25:34.900
I need you to run interference
for me with the other officers.

25:36.940 --> 25:38.460
- You're my deputy.
- I...

25:39.780 --> 25:40.980
I did tell you this would happen.

25:41.060 --> 25:43.140
Yeah, and I'm asking you to
bridge the gap, that's all.

25:43.220 --> 25:44.860
But I don't really feel comfortable...

25:44.940 --> 25:46.300
I understand you don't want to get offside

25:46.380 --> 25:48.020
with the others, particularly Fletch.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.740
I need you to put your
personal feelings aside.

25:49.820 --> 25:52.860
But I... I don't have
personal feelings for...

25:54.500 --> 25:57.100
I don't have any personal
feelings for any of the officers.

25:58.060 --> 25:59.140
I...

26:01.060 --> 26:02.260
I'll do my best.

26:06.180 --> 26:07.740
Wait a minute. What are you saying?

26:07.820 --> 26:09.260
I'm saying I'm gonna go write a speech.

26:09.340 --> 26:10.620
Oh, you are gonna do a speech now?

26:10.740 --> 26:12.980
- Yes.
- You wouldn't when I asked you.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.940
That's because I got a
personal plea from the Governor.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.620
Get off. What are you gonna say?

26:16.700 --> 26:19.140
Ah! Spoilers. Huh?

26:19.220 --> 26:20.420
- Oh!
- Can't tell you.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.820
Amy's gonna be okay.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.220
Oh, thank God.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.020
Yeah, the officers have
been spreading the word.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.380
Screws, Red.

26:26.620 --> 26:29.420
Smith? Jacs is waiting for you.

26:30.420 --> 26:31.660
You got a plan?

26:32.900 --> 26:34.260
Maybe you could take her out.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.220
Can you at least send Boomer with her?

26:36.300 --> 26:39.620
No. You've got to learn
what life's like without me.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.460
Oh, come on.

26:44.220 --> 26:45.780
You're gonna be right.

26:46.620 --> 26:48.020
Have fun.

27:05.060 --> 27:06.460
Come in.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.420
Must be a few months now since you arrived.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.860
Eight weeks, three days.

27:11.940 --> 27:13.900
Still keeping track? That's good.

27:15.540 --> 27:18.020
Takes discipline to survive
in here. Mind and body.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.140
It's easy to get complacent
and let the days bleed into one.

27:23.780 --> 27:24.940
Stop checking your reflection

27:25.020 --> 27:27.020
and that's when you lose yourself
and become one of the herd.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.540
But you're better than that, I can tell.

27:30.020 --> 27:31.180
You're like me.

27:34.540 --> 27:35.780
You were angry this morning.

27:37.940 --> 27:40.540
- We all were.
- As a mother, that must have affected you.

27:41.780 --> 27:42.940
Yeah, it did.

27:43.020 --> 27:46.580
Yeah, of course it did.
Imagine if it was Debbie.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.780
Debbie would never do that.

28:03.580 --> 28:04.820
You're shaking.

28:06.220 --> 28:07.540
Don't be nervous, Bea.

28:08.140 --> 28:09.780
You're the one holding the scissors.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.740
They think it takes a strong woman to
rise to the top in here but it doesn't.

28:15.620 --> 28:16.820
It takes a smart one.

28:17.220 --> 28:18.860
One who chooses their moment.

28:19.180 --> 28:22.020
And understands the repercussions
if they get it wrong.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.940
One well-chosen moment can
take you straight to the top.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.500
And one mistake can
finish you. You see, Bea,

28:34.100 --> 28:35.860
anger is a healthy emotion on the outside,

28:35.940 --> 28:38.420
but in here, unless you've got
the stomach to follow through,

28:38.500 --> 28:39.820
best to keep it to yourself.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.140
Vinnie's coming in tonight.

28:45.860 --> 28:47.100
He'll want me to look my best.

28:50.140 --> 28:51.340
How would you like me to do it?

28:52.180 --> 28:53.300
Surprise me.

28:59.660 --> 29:03.020
Oh, and just so you know,
Ronnie wasn't working for me.

29:03.220 --> 29:04.460
She got desperate.

29:05.220 --> 29:06.620
I'd never use a child like that.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.940
I will, of course, be seeking
monetary compensation...

29:14.020 --> 29:16.220
- Hey, Jacs.
- ... for the three months of my life

29:16.460 --> 29:18.620
wasted by police incompetence

29:18.700 --> 29:19.940
and the victimization

29:20.380 --> 29:22.820
from the so-called Justice Department.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.700
Well, I trust they've learnt their lesson.

29:24.780 --> 29:26.420
And I hope this puts an end to the

29:26.780 --> 29:29.180
harassment of my family, so we can

29:29.980 --> 29:31.780
finally get on with our lives.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.620
Vinnie Holt left courtroom and
returned to his Bacchus Marsh compound.

29:36.820 --> 29:38.900
His wife Jacqueline is
still incarcerated...

29:38.980 --> 29:41.060
Hey! Check out the fresh tart!

29:42.700 --> 29:45.140
Jacs won't be happy about that.

29:53.260 --> 29:55.220
So, I should leave that part about me?

30:01.100 --> 30:02.500
She only wanted me to do her hair.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.900
And next time she whistles?

30:07.060 --> 30:08.340
I made a stupid mistake.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.220
I should never have caved to Jacs.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.380
I'm really sorry.

30:14.060 --> 30:15.540
If you're with me, you do what I say.

30:17.940 --> 30:20.340
- Everyone ready?
- Yeah, Miss Miles.

30:20.420 --> 30:23.220
- Reckon I'm gonna piss meself.
- Ah, no, you'll be right.

30:24.180 --> 30:26.380
- Come on.
- Come on, Liz.

30:31.540 --> 30:34.020
Have a little
faith in yourself, Liz.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.500
Have a bit of faith in yourself.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.020
You're doing a great job.

30:49.780 --> 30:51.100
Okay, hair.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.260
Come on, Jacs, hair.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.820
I've just had it done.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.540
Hair.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.660
Okay. Mouth.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.500
I need a few minutes to fix this now.

31:07.580 --> 31:08.620
Mouth.

31:12.020 --> 31:13.020
Ears.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.820
You still got that boyfriend?

31:18.820 --> 31:19.940
Bet you hardly see him.

31:20.460 --> 31:21.780
You're in here as much as we are.

31:21.860 --> 31:22.980
Breasts.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.620
It's almost a physical pain, isn't it?

31:26.140 --> 31:27.580
Being kept apart so long?

31:28.260 --> 31:29.260
Arms.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.500
The smell of him.

31:32.180 --> 31:33.300
That's what I miss.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.820
Breathing him in.

31:35.900 --> 31:36.980
Turn around.

31:37.420 --> 31:40.380
Is he good looking this boyfriend
of yours? Or did you have to settle?

31:40.460 --> 31:41.620
Feet.

31:42.580 --> 31:45.420
You should make more of an effort.
You could be quite attractive.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.500
Bend over and part your cheeks.

32:02.060 --> 32:03.180
Get dressed.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.460
You haven't got anything
in black, have you?

32:06.700 --> 32:08.220
Vinnie loves me in black.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.180
And then there's Miss Davidson.

32:11.940 --> 32:13.540
At first, I uh...

32:13.900 --> 32:16.940
I thought she took an interest
in me 'cause she wanted something.

32:17.860 --> 32:19.420
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

32:20.620 --> 32:21.980
But I was wrong.

32:22.500 --> 32:23.620
She got me.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.260
She believed in me.

32:27.540 --> 32:28.780
She saw past the front.

32:28.860 --> 32:30.060
She saw who I was.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.300
It helped that she was hot.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.100
Oh.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.860
When you're locked up in here,
it's pretty easy to feel forgotten.

32:39.100 --> 32:42.060
Like you're nothing. Like you're no one.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.260
Before Miss Davidson, a lot of these women

32:44.340 --> 32:45.420
had no hope.

32:46.460 --> 32:49.820
But she changed that with her programs

32:50.420 --> 32:51.740
and her encouragement.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.580
She's given me a hunger,

32:54.940 --> 32:56.340
a desire,

32:59.380 --> 33:00.580
to be a better person.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.260
And thanks to Miss Davidson, I will be.

33:10.300 --> 33:11.980
How the hell did you do that without notes?

33:14.700 --> 33:16.980
I want it right and it's all wrong.

33:17.060 --> 33:19.860
Everything is wrong. I can't do it.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.700
I can't do it, Ollie.

33:21.980 --> 33:23.620
- You're gonna be next.
- No, I've got to go to the loo.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.220
Liz! Liz!

33:25.300 --> 33:27.780
I've got to go to the toilet.
I've got to go to the toilet.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.860
All right, Doreen, you go next.

33:40.580 --> 33:44.620
I'd like to thank Miss Davidson
for letting us speak today.

33:45.220 --> 33:49.300
I know most people think being in here
is the worst thing that could happen.

33:49.580 --> 33:51.620
It's gonna sound crazy, but

33:51.700 --> 33:53.900
for me, it was the best thing...

33:55.900 --> 33:59.380
You're pathetic. You're pathetic.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.580
You're pathetic.

34:01.260 --> 34:02.380
Get inside.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.660
Fuck you! Fuck you!

34:04.780 --> 34:06.340
They're not gonna care if I'm there anyway.

34:06.660 --> 34:08.659
You're hiding out here getting drunk!

34:08.739 --> 34:09.739
Mum!

34:09.900 --> 34:11.100
Nana!

34:11.460 --> 34:13.100
I've tried so hard

34:13.380 --> 34:16.020
to make everything
perfect and it's all wrong.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.340
What do you expect when
you're drunk all the time, Liz?

34:18.420 --> 34:19.500
Liz!

34:19.580 --> 34:22.260
Your posh friends are
gonna laugh at me, right?

34:22.340 --> 34:24.699
So everything I've done, with
the flowers and everything,

34:24.780 --> 34:26.940
I wanted it right and it's all wrong!

34:27.300 --> 34:28.659
It's all wrong!

34:32.420 --> 34:33.420
I couldn't do it.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.860
Sophie, get away from there!

34:34.940 --> 34:36.860
- I couldn't do it.
- Mum, please, stop!

34:36.940 --> 34:38.500
Get inside. Pack your bags.

34:38.739 --> 34:40.139
And get out.

34:40.219 --> 34:41.540
Honey, now, don't be...

34:42.020 --> 34:43.340
Please! You promised!

34:43.420 --> 34:44.699
- Sophie!
- Get away from there!

34:48.940 --> 34:50.100
Stop!

34:53.179 --> 34:55.020
Stop!

34:59.500 --> 35:01.020
Outside, my life was a mess

35:01.100 --> 35:03.180
and I hurt a lot of people.

35:04.420 --> 35:05.780
But now I'm clean

35:05.860 --> 35:07.700
and I'm learning new things.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.300
And I finally have a family, too, so...

35:12.140 --> 35:13.660
Thank you.

35:17.420 --> 35:19.500
"My name is Sue, but

35:19.580 --> 35:20.740
they call me Boomer

35:20.820 --> 35:23.220
because I am always
coming back.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.380
There was a time when I
used to bash a lot of people

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
'cause people make me mad sometimes.

35:28.940 --> 35:31.300
There was one time when I was very angry

35:31.380 --> 35:33.140
and I knocked a few heads together.

35:33.940 --> 35:35.780
And I got to know the slot real well.

35:36.540 --> 35:39.180
But then Franky taught me this trick.

35:40.020 --> 35:42.220
And, most of the time, it works.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.180
It stops me from going bunta."

35:48.420 --> 35:51.220
"Puppies and jelly.

35:52.220 --> 35:55.140
I get this picture in my head
of puppies jumping around in jelly

35:55.220 --> 35:57.260
and they're all mushy
and cute and sticky."

35:57.340 --> 35:58.780
And it stops me from going off."

36:00.140 --> 36:02.460
I haven't been in the
slot now for six months.

36:05.100 --> 36:06.260
Thank you.

36:06.340 --> 36:08.140
Yeah!

36:08.380 --> 36:09.380
Whoo!

36:09.460 --> 36:10.860
Go, Booms!

36:12.020 --> 36:13.180
You did good.

36:13.260 --> 36:16.020
Thank you, Sue, that was very insightful.

36:16.780 --> 36:18.820
We did have a final presenter

36:18.900 --> 36:21.380
but I think she might have
gotten some cold feet. So...

36:21.580 --> 36:23.740
I would like to thank the
three women who did speak

36:23.820 --> 36:24.820
because I know it takes a lot of courage.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.860
Oh, no, here she is.

36:27.940 --> 36:29.820
Our final speaker for today. This is our

36:29.940 --> 36:32.420
peer worker,
Elizabeth Birdsworth.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.500
Few of them
familiar faces in here.

36:41.580 --> 36:42.620
Is she pissed?

36:42.700 --> 36:44.060
She hasn't had booze in ages.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.660
I can see Judge Alsopp.

36:46.740 --> 36:50.140
Oh, mate.  You're looking good.

36:50.220 --> 36:52.700
I haven't seen you in ages.
You're a bit of a spunk.

36:52.980 --> 36:55.500
I really wanted to get
it on with you, Judge.

36:55.700 --> 36:57.740
'Cause I haven't been laid in a while.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.860
All you'd need is half an hour in my

37:00.940 --> 37:02.340
wet cell.

37:03.660 --> 37:05.540
- Get her out of here.
- No, no, no. Hang on.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.700
You all think we're in here

37:07.780 --> 37:09.220
to be rehabilitated, don't you?

37:09.460 --> 37:11.260
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

37:11.340 --> 37:12.380
Get her out.

37:12.460 --> 37:16.140
Some women in here stick
drugs up their kid's bum.

37:16.220 --> 37:17.420
- Get her out.
- No, no, no.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.220
A little kid today OD'd, right?

37:20.580 --> 37:23.340
And she nearly died. No one
told you that, did they, Judge?

37:23.420 --> 37:24.420
Come on.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.820
- I'd just like to apologize...
- Get off me! Leave me.

37:27.180 --> 37:29.220
- Keep it down.
- I can walk. I'm not a fucking cripple!

37:29.540 --> 37:30.580
Get off!

37:30.660 --> 37:31.780
Um...

37:47.300 --> 37:48.300
Oh, my God!

37:48.620 --> 37:50.260
Mum? Mum?

37:50.340 --> 37:51.540
Oh, my goodness!

37:52.020 --> 37:53.180
Is Nana okay?

37:57.940 --> 37:58.980
Oh, God!

38:14.380 --> 38:15.620
What the hell was that?

38:18.180 --> 38:19.300
You ruined today.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.380
You knew how important it was to the women.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.420
And you just made them feel like idiots.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.060
Liz, you have no chance
of making parole now.

38:33.780 --> 38:35.300
Anything to say?

38:35.420 --> 38:37.940
I'm...

38:39.420 --> 38:40.540
I'm sorry.

38:42.660 --> 38:43.940
I'm sorry.

38:44.780 --> 38:45.860
I couldn't do it.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.860
I couldn't do it.

38:51.340 --> 38:53.740
That's not good enough.

38:55.220 --> 38:56.900
I couldn't...

38:59.700 --> 39:01.860
I fucking couldn't do it.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.260
Sorry I'm late.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.700
Three months.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.060
This is a bit special, isn't it?

39:27.460 --> 39:29.820
Secret visits, intimate vetting.

39:30.620 --> 39:31.820
Any chance of a whiskey?

39:38.620 --> 39:42.540
Screws are the same
in Walford, no sense of humor.

39:46.380 --> 39:47.540
You look good.

39:48.860 --> 39:50.100
How's business?

39:50.500 --> 39:52.140
No problems while you were on the inside?

39:55.460 --> 39:57.740
It kept ticking along.
You know what it's like.

39:58.020 --> 40:01.380
A few well-placed phone
calls. Some reliable help.

40:02.300 --> 40:03.540
Some not so.

40:06.060 --> 40:07.340
That's a problem for tomorrow.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.500
Today, it's just you and me, darling.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.260
Who is she?

40:15.460 --> 40:18.340
She works for my lawyer. Her name's Cass.

40:20.140 --> 40:21.260
She's nothing.

40:22.460 --> 40:23.620
You know that.

40:25.020 --> 40:26.340
You're my number one.

40:28.820 --> 40:30.180
You've done something with your hair.

40:31.180 --> 40:32.300
Looks good.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.140
Do you need anything?

40:36.220 --> 40:37.620
Don't fucking flaunt her in public.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.100
You know what that does to me in here?

40:39.860 --> 40:42.460
Show me some respect.
I think I've earned it.

40:48.700 --> 40:51.500
I picked up some cheese
for you on the way over.

40:53.540 --> 40:54.820
Extra bitey.

40:57.740 --> 40:59.540
Make sure the screws don't pinch it.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.300
Hey, mate, mate!

41:24.620 --> 41:26.860
Hey! Can I get a water?
Actually, make it two.

41:41.300 --> 41:42.420
Where'd you get this?

41:42.940 --> 41:44.220
What did you give her?

41:45.460 --> 41:46.940
You dropped something in her hand.

41:49.420 --> 41:52.420
I found this. I was going
to give it to you before

41:52.660 --> 41:53.780
in the office.

41:54.420 --> 41:55.620
Thanks.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.540
I found her bracelet in the corridor.

41:59.020 --> 42:00.420
That was the day before the riot.

42:05.260 --> 42:06.340
What was that about?

42:06.420 --> 42:08.500
She undermined me in
front of another officer.

42:08.580 --> 42:09.780
It's always on your terms, isn't it?

42:09.860 --> 42:11.260
Well, that's because it's my job.

42:11.900 --> 42:12.940
I called her on it.

42:13.140 --> 42:14.420
This is personal and you know it.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.620
This is about you and me
and we need to talk about it.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.500
What, you think it's gonna disappear
just if you don't talk about it?

42:19.700 --> 42:21.380
Can you just take your
hand off the door, please?

42:22.700 --> 42:23.940
She laid the boot in.

42:24.900 --> 42:26.780
- Running away isn't gonna solve anything.
- That's enough.

42:31.180 --> 42:34.940
I was sure that, if I found the
bracelet, I'd know who killed her.

42:36.300 --> 42:37.620
See how fucked it is?

42:38.100 --> 42:40.460
This whole thing has got me seeing stuff,

42:41.500 --> 42:42.700
wondering.

42:44.740 --> 42:45.740
And you're my best mate.

42:46.460 --> 42:47.700
But this...

42:49.060 --> 42:50.100
It's nothing.

42:51.020 --> 42:52.260
The women, they...

42:55.700 --> 42:56.980
One of them, they did it.

42:57.660 --> 42:59.100
I've got to know who did that to Meg.

42:59.540 --> 43:02.540
You can't do this by yourself, Will, okay?

43:03.100 --> 43:04.420
You need to get some help.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.020
Give me another Scotch, please.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.420
And you don't need another Scotch.

43:08.540 --> 43:09.620
Fuck off.

43:40.260 --> 43:43.220
Kiss me! Kiss me!

43:44.220 --> 43:45.380
Kiss me.

43:47.940 --> 43:49.260
I had enough.

43:49.540 --> 43:50.620
Why?

43:50.700 --> 43:51.940
Fuck off.

43:52.860 --> 43:54.180
Fuck.

44:07.060 --> 44:08.060
Fuck!
