01:12.238 --> 01:14.074
<i>Hui-ju came to me.</i>

01:14.157 --> 01:17.118
A proud woman like her asked me for help.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.039
She asked me to stop you.

01:38.431 --> 01:42.727
<i>You don't love me. Wake up!</i>

01:42.811 --> 01:44.062
<i>Who are you to judge my feelings?</i>

01:44.646 --> 01:46.064
<i>This isn't love!</i>

01:56.157 --> 01:57.700
No--

01:57.784 --> 01:58.660
Stop--

02:46.291 --> 02:48.501
Hello, Ms. Lee.
I should've called you first--

02:48.585 --> 02:49.419
<i>Ms. Jeong,</i>

02:49.919 --> 02:52.046
<i>did Mr. Seo visit you today?</i>

02:52.130 --> 02:53.172
Sorry?

02:53.256 --> 02:57.635
Maybe I shouldn't have provoked him
like that, but he just wouldn't listen.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.680
<i>Watch out for him.</i>

03:02.807 --> 03:03.892
Okay.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.757
Did you have a drink?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.385
A bit.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.554
I couldn't bear the pain.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.935
There are many people here. Leave quietly.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.812
We'll talk at the gallery tomorrow.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.316
You should've been straightforward with me

03:55.276 --> 03:57.237
instead of hiding behind Ms. Lee.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.327
Make the video public.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.746
Let people be the judge of it.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.331
Show it to them.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.709
You're drunk.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.836
I'll call a cab, so--

04:13.920 --> 04:17.090
Did you want to ruin me
by making me out to be the bad guy?

04:18.174 --> 04:20.927
Did you scheme all this? Is that it?

04:21.010 --> 04:22.512
Lower your voice.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.894
You're anxious about so many things.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.564
So why do you treat me like this?

04:34.357 --> 04:35.400
What?

05:01.467 --> 05:04.345
You think it was all a scheme? How so?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.431
You know it better than I do.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.808
You showed up unannounced that day.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.477
Was that my scheming too?

05:14.522 --> 05:16.774
I don't intend to hurt you.

05:16.858 --> 05:20.111
I just needed a reason
to opt out of the project.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.821
A reason Ms. Lee would understand.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.532
Why were you so desperate
to opt out of the project?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.868
Because I wanted to stop making mistakes.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.706
Woo-jae.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.877
Please let me go.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.007
Your career has just begun.

05:41.090 --> 05:44.886
And you have the potential
to do whatever you want in the future.

05:44.969 --> 05:48.806
But I can't be the one by your side.
It shouldn't be me.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.268
Don't call it a mistake.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.438
You had feelings for me.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.024
That was a mistake?

05:58.107 --> 06:01.277
I did. I loved you.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.113
But it was all a mistake, so I ended it.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.157
And I felt guilty about it.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.329
When I said I wanted the best for you,

06:12.038 --> 06:13.623
I truly meant it.

06:14.582 --> 06:18.586
So why are you complicating everything?

06:18.669 --> 06:20.296
You're one to talk.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.634
You abandoned me and ran away,

06:25.802 --> 06:27.762
but I believed you'd come back.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.516
And when I was blindly waiting for you,

06:32.433 --> 06:35.353
your husband hit me with his car
and disguised it as an accident.

06:36.687 --> 06:40.691
Did you think I was going to let you two
live happily ever after?

06:40.775 --> 06:44.320
You're wrong! That's not what happened!

06:45.905 --> 06:47.990
My husband was with me that night.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.953
I'm sorry about the accident,
but he had nothing to do with it.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.415
Liar.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.336
That's what I remember.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.349
I'll compensate you
for the years you lost.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.269
As much as I can.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.062
But that's it.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.107
It's over between us.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.577
I think you can leave now.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.041
What are you so afraid of?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.671
Is it…

07:44.797 --> 07:45.798
me?

07:54.849 --> 07:57.018
Are you scared of me, Hui-ju?

08:07.028 --> 08:07.862
Woo-jae.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.533
Woo-jae, wait. Seo Woo-jae!

08:13.159 --> 08:14.327
That hurts!

08:17.246 --> 08:18.247
Woo-jae…

08:51.489 --> 08:53.366
Woo-jae…

08:55.409 --> 08:58.621
Woo-jae, wait. Seo Woo-jae!

08:58.704 --> 08:59.956
That hurts!

09:02.708 --> 09:03.543
Woo-jae…

09:05.336 --> 09:06.546
Woo-jae…

09:06.629 --> 09:08.839
-I can't let you go like this.
-Woo-jae…

09:09.382 --> 09:10.716
If I can't have you,

09:11.217 --> 09:13.719
nobody can have you. That's only fair.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.013
Wait…

09:23.145 --> 09:23.980
Woo-jae!

09:51.549 --> 09:54.802
No! Stop!

10:17.575 --> 10:19.035
No, Woo-jae!

10:20.453 --> 10:21.621
No!

10:31.756 --> 10:34.300
Ho-su, don't do that.
Be careful or you'll get hurt.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.429
Li-sa, when did you go out--

10:40.097 --> 10:41.098
Li-sa!

10:43.267 --> 10:45.144
One minute. Li-sa!

10:55.488 --> 10:56.572
Li-sa.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.617
Li-sa.

11:00.826 --> 11:01.994
Open…

11:02.078 --> 11:03.746
Let me talk to her.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.414
When did you get here?

11:06.582 --> 11:07.875
What's wrong?

11:08.542 --> 11:12.046
I got upset, and it must've startled her.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.676
I need to fix this myself.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.929
I got this, so you should go downstairs.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.347
Ho-su is all alone.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.185
Dad!

11:28.896 --> 11:30.231
Coming, Ho-su.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.299
Li-sa, it's me.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.347
Are you okay?

12:07.643 --> 12:08.853
How is he?

12:16.402 --> 12:19.822
Fortunately, he wasn't that badly hurt.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.574
He's okay.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.828
So… So don't worry too much.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.039
You should go to bed.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.461
And we can talk again tomorrow, okay?

13:06.869 --> 13:10.789
I think we should
let Li-sa get some rest tonight.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.292
You see…

13:14.251 --> 13:18.339
I shouldn't have gotten upset
and cornered her like that.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.426
Her teacher told me not to upset her,

13:22.510 --> 13:24.637
but it's quite difficult.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.371
Your delivery is here.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.165
-Chicken!
-Thank you.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.792
-Enjoy.
-The wings are mine!

13:59.463 --> 14:01.173
We ordered fried chicken for dinner.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.385
Good job.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.388
This looks tasty. Let's go eat.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.141
Gosh, it's your favorite,

14:11.725 --> 14:12.768
soy sauce chicken.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.273
It looks so good.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.993
SEDATIVES

14:40.129 --> 14:43.507
If you drink this,
Ho-su will want some as well.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.217
Drink this instead.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.137
Your mom's orders.

14:51.515 --> 14:52.808
This is good too.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.394
Li-sa didn't have dinner yet.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.146
I'll handle it.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.316
Anyway, I should go
talk to her teacher tomorrow.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.860
Why? Did she do it again?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.155
We'll talk later.

15:06.780 --> 15:11.410
Give me more chicken, Dad.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.164
All right. Let me debone it

15:16.373 --> 15:18.792
for your convenience.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.878
Gosh, it looks tasty.

15:27.843 --> 15:28.969
Is it good?

15:37.144 --> 15:38.896
<i>No, Woo-jae! Don't do it!</i>

15:38.979 --> 15:40.481
Woo-jae!

15:56.705 --> 15:59.375
Woo-jae.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.396
<i>"Cassandra once said this to her."</i>

18:26.480 --> 18:29.900
"'If you stab a human,
you will end up dying too.'"

18:30.484 --> 18:34.113
"This incident was engraved
in Maya's memory."

18:34.780 --> 18:37.116
"Maya's wish was to…"

19:43.557 --> 19:44.808
<i>Where are you headed?</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:57.905
<i>Be careful, or you'll crash.
Do you also want to die?</i>

19:59.656 --> 20:02.743
<i>See? You can't escape from me.</i>

20:02.826 --> 20:04.119
That's enough.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.537
<i>We'll always be together.</i>

20:05.621 --> 20:07.915
<i>-Now, in the future,</i>
-That's enough.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.959
<i>-and even after death.</i>
-That's enough!

20:21.511 --> 20:22.679
<i>I love you.</i>

20:24.598 --> 20:25.682
<i>I love you.</i>

20:28.101 --> 20:29.269
<i>I love you.</i>

23:16.353 --> 23:17.521
<i>One day,</i>

23:18.772 --> 23:22.317
<i>a silver bell from a monastery in Sligo
fell into the lake.</i>

23:24.152 --> 23:26.655
<i>Even to this day,
those with pure hearts and souls</i>

23:27.322 --> 23:29.616
<i>can hear the bell chiming.</i>

23:31.952 --> 23:32.953
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

23:35.372 --> 23:37.707
There's no way I'd be able to hear that.

24:02.649 --> 24:07.362
FINALE
AFTER THE STORM

25:25.398 --> 25:26.566
Did I sleep here?

25:27.734 --> 25:29.444
You slept like a baby.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.991
Gosh.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.667
I haven't slept this well in a while.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.752
It seemed so.

25:45.835 --> 25:49.714
You were sleeping so soundly
that I watched you for a while.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.177
Ho-su.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.720
An Ho-su.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.515
Time to get up.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.358
What are you doing here?

26:51.901 --> 26:53.236
Let's have breakfast.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.532
What happened to him?

26:59.409 --> 27:00.744
Is he really okay?

27:02.037 --> 27:03.246
Is he alive?

27:06.958 --> 27:08.418
Come on.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.421
People don't die that easily.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.385
It's not that easy to kill a grown man

27:17.469 --> 27:20.680
with a stab from a tiny hand like yours.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.603
-Then how is he?
-He's fine.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.438
Even the doctor said so.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.026
Listen carefully.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.155
You only did that to help me.

27:37.238 --> 27:40.533
He barged in here and choked me.
He's in the wrong.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.370
You didn't do anything wrong. Okay?

27:45.121 --> 27:46.206
Answer me.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.506
I promise.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.885
Nothing happened yesterday.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.097
Everything's totally fine.

28:03.681 --> 28:05.058
You can forget what happened.

28:25.787 --> 28:26.746
<i>Hui-ju?</i>

28:27.997 --> 28:28.873
<i>Hui-ju?</i>

28:29.582 --> 28:31.000
What?

28:32.127 --> 28:32.961
Gosh.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.052
Is the preparation going well?

28:41.136 --> 28:44.723
There's not much I need to do.
Hyeon-seong is taking care of everything.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.601
Hui-ju, are you okay?

28:48.685 --> 28:50.729
I must've slept wrong.

28:50.812 --> 28:54.566
Gosh. Lie down. Let me massage your neck.

28:54.649 --> 28:57.318
It's okay.
It'll go away once I take a nap.

29:07.328 --> 29:10.665
Li-sa. I thought
I wouldn't get to see you today.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.918
Mom's car isn't here.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.838
Well, she just left.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.007
I was playing a game with Ho-su.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.176
I see.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.682
I don't want to take up your time. Go in.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.476
Okay.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.858
Uncle.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.904
Do you still envy me?

29:41.696 --> 29:43.615
You once told me

29:44.365 --> 29:46.367
you envied me for having a mom.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.453
<i>But she sides with you every time.</i>

29:49.829 --> 29:51.122
Even if I kill someone?

29:55.668 --> 29:57.295
Do you still think that way?

29:59.964 --> 30:02.509
I do, since it's your mom.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.844
She'll be always on your side.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.749
<i>It's the same passcode.</i>

30:35.250 --> 30:36.543
Come anytime you want.

31:21.671 --> 31:22.922
And these…

31:29.679 --> 31:30.555
What are you doing?

31:39.397 --> 31:40.440
Hey.

31:42.442 --> 31:45.695
This? Woo-jae…

31:48.031 --> 31:50.033
He wants to leave. He says he'll leave.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.369
He's done making wrong choices.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.130
Well… You know how he is.

32:05.089 --> 32:09.093
He's always reckless and unpredictable.

32:10.803 --> 32:14.432
But why are you packing his bags for him?

32:16.893 --> 32:19.228
Don't get me wrong. He asked me to--

32:19.312 --> 32:20.730
Woo-jae is dead.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.984
Did you think I wouldn't know?

32:29.656 --> 32:31.366
Cat got your tongue?

32:54.097 --> 32:56.724
<i>Three of you went in. But Li-sa and you…</i>

32:59.227 --> 33:00.937
Only two of you came out.

33:03.731 --> 33:06.442
It's best not to lie
if you're going to get caught so soon.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.281
I guess you forgot about this.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.159
But then,

33:16.452 --> 33:18.287
I didn't know what to do either.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.790
I can only imagine how you felt.

33:22.417 --> 33:26.212
You may have meticulously dodged security
cameras and gotten rid of his body,

33:28.131 --> 33:29.882
but the blood and fingerprints…

33:31.718 --> 33:33.302
on this pen will point to Li-sa--

33:33.386 --> 33:34.387
You're wrong.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.307
Then? Was it you?

33:39.892 --> 33:40.893
What?

33:46.357 --> 33:47.900
I thought it was you.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.487
But I guess it was Li-sa.

33:52.905 --> 33:55.366
That explains why you're acting this way.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.539
Hae-won.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.042
Please turn a blind eye to this.
I beg you.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.130
Even if I get arrested for it, my husband…

34:10.882 --> 34:14.260
Hyeon-seong will never abandon me.

34:14.343 --> 34:17.138
He'll hire every single competent lawyer
in this country.

34:17.805 --> 34:21.726
I'm sure it'd be a cakewalk to argue
that I was tired of his stalking

34:21.809 --> 34:24.687
and that I did what I did in self-defense.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.148
Then I won't be punished.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.110
Is that what you want?

34:33.613 --> 34:34.906
No, right?

34:35.865 --> 34:38.409
I'll give up everything.
I'll never paint again.

34:39.118 --> 34:41.954
I'll leave my family as well.

34:42.497 --> 34:43.748
I'll never come back.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.795
I'll never show up
in front of you or anyone else.

34:50.046 --> 34:54.133
I'll make myself out to be
a heartless bitch who deceived

34:54.217 --> 34:56.928
and left everyone
after having an affair with Woo-jae.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.058
I know I should've come clean ages ago.

35:02.975 --> 35:06.604
Since my repentance is long overdue,
I'll pay for it even longer.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.690
Everyone will curse me.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.443
And my family will be

35:12.527 --> 35:17.281
so ashamed of the fact
that I was a part of their family

35:17.865 --> 35:20.493
that they'll want to remove me
from their memory.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.411
So, please.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.792
I'm sorry, Hae-won.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.337
I wanted to apologize to you
countless times.

35:33.131 --> 35:37.218
But I decided not to
because I was afraid of losing everything.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.930
So laugh at me all you want

35:41.013 --> 35:43.558
and enjoy watching me fall.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.228
But please spare Li-sa.

35:47.728 --> 35:50.648
I'm the one who sinned,
so why should she pay?

35:50.731 --> 35:53.192
Please spare her, will you?

36:00.199 --> 36:01.284
You're right.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.495
Li-sa is innocent.

36:07.915 --> 36:09.542
Can you really give up everything?

36:12.962 --> 36:14.172
You're willing to live

36:15.214 --> 36:18.176
in the prison you made for yourself
until the day you die.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.137
Is that what you're saying?

36:55.963 --> 36:58.591
Why are you cleaning
when you're behind on work?

36:58.674 --> 37:00.301
It's squeaky clean.

37:01.302 --> 37:04.513
You know how easy it is
to get distracted when you can't focus.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.975
But still, this is just… Gosh.

37:08.684 --> 37:11.812
You even washed your car.
You're going to be exhausted.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.983
Cleaning helps me sort myself out.
I like it.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.027
What brings you here?

37:18.945 --> 37:20.780
Well, I haven't seen you all day.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.115
Aren't you going to bed?

37:23.199 --> 37:25.952
Go to bed first. Let me finish this up.

37:26.535 --> 37:27.954
No one can stop you.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.539
By the way, where's that painting?

37:33.084 --> 37:35.419
-What?
-Our family portrait.

37:40.633 --> 37:41.676
That?

37:42.677 --> 37:45.263
I completely ruined it
while retouching it.

37:45.346 --> 37:47.640
Why did you do that? It was already great.

37:47.723 --> 37:48.808
Exactly.

37:49.642 --> 37:52.311
I shouldn't have been a greedy idiot.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.689
I should've been content with it.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.902
But I decided to retouch it
and ruined everything.

38:02.238 --> 38:06.033
It's okay. You can always paint it again.

38:06.575 --> 38:07.702
It's all right.

38:44.488 --> 38:47.033
<i>Why did you change your mind
all of a sudden?</i>

38:50.161 --> 38:52.872
I realized I was being selfish for wanting

38:54.623 --> 38:56.709
to keep Ho-su by my side.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.922
This is a great opportunity for him.

39:02.506 --> 39:05.718
I don't want
to be the reason he misses it.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.722
Like you said,

39:10.431 --> 39:13.392
Ho-su will be the one
to inherit all that you've built.

39:15.144 --> 39:19.106
That's all the more reason…

39:21.150 --> 39:26.072
he should be given the education you want
and I should be grateful.

39:33.371 --> 39:37.208
I purchased them based on my preferences,
so it isn't very cohesive.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.920
Once the gallery opens, I'd like you

39:41.003 --> 39:44.173
to display them permanently,
so the visitors could enjoy them.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.384
I'll leave it to you, Yun-jeong.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.969
You most certainly have a keen eye.

39:50.179 --> 39:53.974
These works will be enough
to fill up an entire exhibition hall.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.062
I know you'll do well.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.439
And my husband…

40:02.566 --> 40:04.735
Mr. An will help manage it.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.784
I guess this will be my last time here.

40:24.046 --> 40:28.050
JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

40:31.887 --> 40:33.806
WE ALL HAVE A WINDOW IN OUR HEARTS

40:33.889 --> 40:36.767
WE CAN EITHER STAY INDOORS
OR OPEN IT AND GO OUTSIDE

40:50.865 --> 40:53.200
What made you want to come here?

40:54.326 --> 40:57.163
You're the one
who introduced this food to me.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.499
On the first day. Do you not remember?

41:01.542 --> 41:04.086
You brought me here on our first date.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.255
Gosh. You know what?

41:07.590 --> 41:10.885
It was so bland.
I didn't know what I was eating,

41:10.968 --> 41:12.636
but I was too famished to say no.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.057
I wanted to treat you
to the tastiest dish.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.609
Thank you.

41:29.236 --> 41:30.237
Hold on.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.493
Vinegar…

41:41.207 --> 41:43.167
-Thank you.
-What?

41:44.084 --> 41:45.836
Whenever I went to a buffet,

41:47.004 --> 41:50.007
I was always determined
to have all the food they served there.

41:50.591 --> 41:52.968
But I'd end up

41:53.052 --> 41:57.181
filling my first plate
with <i>gimbap</i> and <i>japchae</i>.

41:57.264 --> 42:00.142
So I'd be full
after having that one plate.

42:00.226 --> 42:02.019
I used to be a fool like that.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.358
But thanks to you,

42:08.025 --> 42:10.653
I'm now able to appreciate
many great things in life.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.324
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.660
Here.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.378
It's so good.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.968
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

43:09.211 --> 43:10.921
<i>Do you still want to break up?</i>

43:12.673 --> 43:14.300
Then just die.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.026
Ma'am.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.446
Don't ever forgive me.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.490
Just continue

43:39.825 --> 43:41.160
despising me.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.537
That way,

43:45.039 --> 43:46.498
you'll still see me.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.752
I'm not running away.

43:50.544 --> 43:53.297
I just want to do my best
for Jeong-seop's sake too.

43:57.217 --> 43:59.720
You know I can't hold a candle to him.

44:01.555 --> 44:04.058
You might not be satisfied
with the result,

44:04.975 --> 44:06.393
but I'll try my best.

44:08.437 --> 44:10.022
I'll become a better person

44:11.607 --> 44:14.818
who can help others when they're in need.

44:26.997 --> 44:27.998
Here.

44:29.124 --> 44:32.878
This is the hospital address
I'll be working at and my number.

44:34.129 --> 44:36.590
Feel free to call me anytime you want.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.176
I'll call you every day too.

44:50.229 --> 44:53.065
Then, take care.

45:23.887 --> 45:27.057
HOME ADDRESS, HOSPITAL ADDRESS,
HOSPITAL PHONE NUMBER

45:27.141 --> 45:32.146
HOW TO MAKE INTERNATIONAL CALLS

45:35.649 --> 45:36.775
<i>Do you think</i>

45:37.693 --> 45:40.487
<i>he would want his friend
to live a life of suffering forever?</i>

45:42.156 --> 45:44.324
<i>Was that the kind of person he was?</i>

46:18.609 --> 46:21.403
Honey!

46:27.993 --> 46:29.077
Who are you guys?

46:29.161 --> 46:31.413
-You're mistaken. I'm meeting a friend.
-Let's go.

46:31.497 --> 46:35.083
Tell them! Gu Jeong-yeon! Hey!

46:35.167 --> 46:38.295
You bitch! God damn it!

46:52.935 --> 46:53.977
You startled me.

46:55.646 --> 46:56.480
When did you come?

46:58.774 --> 47:01.026
Tell me I did the right thing.

47:01.610 --> 47:02.778
What?

47:02.861 --> 47:04.655
Just say it to me.

47:05.739 --> 47:08.909
"Jeong-yeon, well done."

47:14.122 --> 47:15.374
Well done, Jeong-yeon.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.628
What did you do, though?

47:20.879 --> 47:23.090
My dad used to tell me

47:24.591 --> 47:28.845
that it's foolish to say things
you don't really have to say.

47:30.222 --> 47:32.182
That's why

47:32.683 --> 47:36.395
I've never told Hae-won
who her dad was. And I never will.

47:36.478 --> 47:37.938
Don't tell her.

47:38.021 --> 47:41.817
Besides, she looks
exactly like you anyway.

47:46.613 --> 47:47.531
What's wrong?

47:48.699 --> 47:50.325
I don't know.

47:51.618 --> 47:54.162
I don't know
how things turned out this way.

47:55.747 --> 47:57.541
That's life.

47:58.792 --> 48:00.168
Most of the time,

48:01.211 --> 48:03.505
you're not in control
of what goes on around you.

48:07.217 --> 48:08.427
Thank you.

48:09.636 --> 48:11.471
What's gotten into you today?

48:12.055 --> 48:13.348
And I'm really…

48:20.856 --> 48:22.065
hungry.

48:23.233 --> 48:24.484
Get me something to eat.

48:27.029 --> 48:28.155
Okay.

48:29.156 --> 48:30.240
One minute.

48:52.387 --> 48:53.847
And I'm truly…

49:02.856 --> 49:04.441
sorry.

49:56.076 --> 49:58.203
Get up.

49:59.204 --> 50:00.080
Get up.

50:00.163 --> 50:02.416
Support your body with your arms.

50:04.418 --> 50:07.212
You should at least have enough strength

50:07.295 --> 50:10.424
to sit on the toilet by yourself,
shouldn't you?

50:11.341 --> 50:13.343
Do I have to clean your shit as well?

50:25.439 --> 50:27.983
I'm the one who'll be
by your side to the end.

50:28.525 --> 50:31.319
Listen to me. Grab it!

50:35.323 --> 50:36.283
What's wrong?

50:37.451 --> 50:38.744
Offended by my tone?

50:43.915 --> 50:48.170
Your formal tone
was much more repulsive to me.

50:59.931 --> 51:01.057
Get up.

51:21.828 --> 51:22.871
It's hot.

51:29.336 --> 51:30.754
When are you leaving?

51:32.964 --> 51:34.382
This weekend.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.889
Why? Does it make you sad?

51:45.018 --> 51:49.564
This is our last meal together.
We should've had something better.

51:49.648 --> 51:51.274
Why is this our last meal?

51:51.358 --> 51:53.568
It's not like I'm not coming back.

51:55.904 --> 51:57.989
Oh, right. I have something for you.

52:06.540 --> 52:07.541
Take it.

52:09.501 --> 52:11.378
I'm not asking you to come with me.

52:11.878 --> 52:14.756
Just feel free to come
whenever you need a break.

52:18.343 --> 52:19.177
Come on.

52:20.512 --> 52:22.973
You don't have to come, so just keep it.

52:23.056 --> 52:24.349
Consider it insurance.

52:36.152 --> 52:38.280
You came after weeks.
Are you leaving already?

52:38.363 --> 52:41.032
You even spent the weekend on campus.
What's going on?

52:41.116 --> 52:44.411
The upcoming exam is very important.
I'll come visit next week.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.580
You better. I'll be waiting.

52:48.748 --> 52:50.500
Are you really okay going by yourself?

52:50.584 --> 52:51.877
I have company.

52:57.465 --> 52:58.550
Bye.

53:02.429 --> 53:04.222
Hey, what should we get to eat?

53:04.306 --> 53:05.891
-Anything's good.
-Anything?

53:07.225 --> 53:08.059
Let's go.

53:14.316 --> 53:16.568
You should've come out to say bye.

53:16.651 --> 53:18.904
I already said goodbye.

53:18.987 --> 53:21.364
We hugged, and I even gave her some money.

53:23.325 --> 53:24.701
Why are you packing?

53:25.577 --> 53:27.746
I'll stay in Daejeon for a while.

53:28.288 --> 53:30.707
There's a vacant spot
at a skincare shop there.

53:30.790 --> 53:34.085
Hey, check this out.
Doesn't it look luxurious?

53:35.587 --> 53:37.005
-What is it?
-What?

53:38.048 --> 53:39.716
Why are you running away this time?

53:41.217 --> 53:42.844
It's not like that this time.

53:44.387 --> 53:46.598
It's great that
there's someone who needs me.

53:46.681 --> 53:50.018
Besides, you're going
to move back in here.

53:54.397 --> 53:56.316
Has he not called you yet?

53:56.942 --> 53:58.443
Is he ghosting you again?

54:01.738 --> 54:04.032
Is it over for good?

54:06.952 --> 54:07.994
Yes.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.414
I won't be able

54:12.499 --> 54:13.875
to see him ever again.

54:15.168 --> 54:18.004
Goodness. It's so easy for him, isn't it?

54:18.088 --> 54:19.214
Never mind.

54:21.424 --> 54:23.510
There's no need to get worked up over him.

54:25.095 --> 54:27.722
It's for the best
to wrap things up quickly.

54:28.348 --> 54:32.268
It's much better
than being treated like a doormat.

54:35.188 --> 54:36.189
Good job.

54:38.483 --> 54:39.484
Well done.

54:48.201 --> 54:50.161
Ms. Gu Jeong-yeon, this is the police.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.414
Ms. Gu?

54:58.545 --> 55:00.839
Mom. What's going on?

55:20.191 --> 55:22.152
NO FISHING, DANGER

55:24.279 --> 55:26.114
It looks so dreary already.

55:27.449 --> 55:29.993
This is what happens
when you stop tending to a place.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.831
The dock on the other side

55:34.914 --> 55:37.250
has also shut down,
so there aren't any boats there.

55:41.713 --> 55:44.841
So where will you go live now?

55:45.467 --> 55:48.511
I've settled in one place for too long.

55:48.595 --> 55:51.097
The nomadic lifestyle
doesn't sound too bad.

55:53.308 --> 55:54.934
Should I go with you?

55:55.018 --> 55:56.144
As if.

55:56.227 --> 55:59.814
Do you think you can leave
your kids behind and do that?

56:02.317 --> 56:03.568
What will you do now?

56:05.236 --> 56:07.864
Once I leave,
you'll have no one to turn to.

56:10.992 --> 56:13.411
You may live a fancy lifestyle,

56:13.495 --> 56:15.705
but you have no one you can lean on.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.666
You don't have any parents.

56:18.750 --> 56:21.419
You even sent
your one and only brother abroad.

56:21.503 --> 56:23.171
What will you do now?

56:23.254 --> 56:24.464
Beats me.

56:26.341 --> 56:29.344
Thanks for listening to my whining
all this time.

56:29.427 --> 56:30.845
I'm glad you know.

56:33.681 --> 56:35.308
What about that?

56:35.391 --> 56:39.521
There's not much I can do for you
as you embark on a new journey.

56:40.188 --> 56:42.941
You know how rich I am, right?
So just take this.

56:43.024 --> 56:45.110
But, that's…

56:45.693 --> 56:47.237
Just take it.

56:47.320 --> 56:50.406
That truck is too big
for your petite body.

56:50.490 --> 56:52.325
I can't…

56:52.408 --> 56:54.953
-If you don't take it--
-I'll take it.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.665
I can't believe this.
You're really giving this to me?

56:58.748 --> 57:00.083
Yes.

57:01.751 --> 57:02.794
I love you.

57:19.561 --> 57:20.645
Hey.

57:21.688 --> 57:23.022
What are those flowers for?

57:27.402 --> 57:28.319
What would you like?

57:30.613 --> 57:33.408
Sir, let me buy you a drink today.

57:33.491 --> 57:34.534
Me?

57:35.785 --> 57:36.661
What for?

57:36.744 --> 57:38.663
I heard about what happened with my mom.

57:39.414 --> 57:41.875
She's being questioned
by the police right now,

57:41.958 --> 57:44.169
so I'd like to apologize on her behalf.

57:46.254 --> 57:48.089
You don't apologize
on someone else's behalf.

57:49.966 --> 57:52.218
And your mom already apologized enough.

57:55.221 --> 57:56.764
I'm sorry.

58:17.118 --> 58:20.371
And I don't have the right to forgive her.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.707
I was at fault too.

58:23.875 --> 58:26.377
From my wife's point of view,
both your mom and me are…

58:27.462 --> 58:28.505
No.

58:30.423 --> 58:32.008
I'm more at fault.

58:35.386 --> 58:37.805
Strictly speaking,
Jeong-yeon was also a victim.

58:38.723 --> 58:40.600
But what she did was still wrong.

58:41.726 --> 58:43.686
So she needs to pay for it.

58:43.770 --> 58:45.271
That's best for her too.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.440
That way, she can start afresh.

58:57.575 --> 59:01.287
She won't be coming back here again.

59:04.666 --> 59:06.042
I told you.

59:06.668 --> 59:08.795
She flees when she's in a tough spot.

59:21.683 --> 59:24.143
-Do you want to make a bet?
-What?

59:24.644 --> 59:28.106
I won't be leaving here anytime soon,
so I'll wait for her.

59:28.731 --> 59:30.733
I have a knack for waiting.

59:31.484 --> 59:32.819
You can treat me then.

59:32.902 --> 59:35.238
To the most expensive and oldest drink.

59:35.321 --> 59:38.575
Mr. Yoon, do you like…

59:41.035 --> 59:44.330
Because of my work,
it's hard for me to trust anyone.

59:45.456 --> 59:49.002
Trust leads to expectation,
which leads to disappointment.

59:49.961 --> 59:53.423
But Jeong-yeon keeps trusting
no matter how many times she's betrayed.

59:54.799 --> 59:58.595
And it may look foolish,
but it takes a lot of courage.

1:00:01.097 --> 1:00:02.890
So I'm going to trust her.

1:00:07.061 --> 1:00:10.273
The loser buys
that 40-year-old liquor, okay?

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:23.745
RICE & BAR

1:00:31.377 --> 1:00:33.171
RICE MEAL

1:01:13.670 --> 1:01:14.921
<i>When will you be leaving?</i>

1:01:17.423 --> 1:01:18.758
Just one more night.

1:01:20.093 --> 1:01:23.262
Let me spend one more night
with the kids, and then I'll leave.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:29.268
You said I wouldn't know

1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:32.397
how a mother would feel, right?

1:01:36.859 --> 1:01:38.569
But I think I do.

1:01:44.701 --> 1:01:48.746
I also had a chance
to become a mother once.

1:02:04.053 --> 1:02:05.012
Were you…

1:02:05.513 --> 1:02:07.557
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.

1:02:10.435 --> 1:02:13.521
I just wanted to tell you that.

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:21.696
You should go.

1:02:48.723 --> 1:02:52.769
While packing my bag, I found this.

1:02:54.395 --> 1:02:55.646
I don't need it.

1:02:56.397 --> 1:02:58.649
I just wanted you to know

1:02:58.733 --> 1:03:03.029
how brightly you used to shine

1:03:03.863 --> 1:03:05.072
and how…

1:03:06.532 --> 1:03:08.451
jealous I was of you.

1:04:12.807 --> 1:04:14.183
It's okay.

1:04:17.103 --> 1:04:18.646
It's okay.

1:06:27.024 --> 1:06:28.025
Honey.

1:06:35.199 --> 1:06:36.158
What…

1:06:43.457 --> 1:06:45.835
<i>Sir, there's something you need to see.</i>

1:06:47.336 --> 1:06:49.380
Ma'am, check this out.

1:06:50.172 --> 1:06:51.465
Goodness.

1:06:52.425 --> 1:06:53.592
Is that why--

1:06:53.676 --> 1:06:56.137
What is it? Is there something you know?

1:06:56.220 --> 1:06:57.430
No, nothing.

1:06:57.930 --> 1:07:00.099
-We're a bit dumbfounded too.
-Hello.

1:07:00.182 --> 1:07:03.561
Even I'm confused about what's going on.

1:07:03.644 --> 1:07:04.895
Yes.

1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:13.946
Where's Woo-jae?

1:07:15.906 --> 1:07:17.366
Where is he?

1:07:18.743 --> 1:07:20.369
I haven't seen him in days.

1:07:20.995 --> 1:07:22.788
And the studio is a mess.

1:07:22.872 --> 1:07:23.998
What's going on?

1:07:24.081 --> 1:07:27.168
What are you two scheming this time?

1:07:27.251 --> 1:07:29.378
Whatever it is,
it has nothing to do with me.

1:07:33.883 --> 1:07:36.761
I can't reach Hui-ju.

1:07:39.263 --> 1:07:41.599
Something must be going on.

1:07:43.184 --> 1:07:44.560
Call Woo-jae.

1:07:44.643 --> 1:07:47.730
I'm sure that bastard
did something to her again.

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:51.025
Ms. Gu. Please.

1:07:54.236 --> 1:07:56.530
Hui-ju could be in danger right now.

1:08:01.786 --> 1:08:03.245
Is that what you think?

1:08:05.623 --> 1:08:08.542
Does it seem to you
he kidnapped her or something?

1:08:11.420 --> 1:08:13.297
Hui-ju and Woo-jae…

1:08:14.173 --> 1:08:15.341
Those two

1:08:17.134 --> 1:08:18.886
left with each other again.

1:08:20.304 --> 1:08:21.305
What?

1:08:25.309 --> 1:08:26.560
You're wrong.

1:08:27.061 --> 1:08:30.397
Hui-ju left of her own volition.

1:08:30.898 --> 1:08:32.233
No one forced her.

1:08:33.109 --> 1:08:36.529
What are you… No. You're wrong.

1:08:36.612 --> 1:08:38.656
Why would she leave her family? Her kids?

1:08:38.739 --> 1:08:40.241
She did it back then too.

1:08:41.659 --> 1:08:43.994
What's stopping them from doing it again?

1:08:47.623 --> 1:08:49.375
She must've felt guilty this time,

1:08:50.084 --> 1:08:52.086
seeing how she sent me a text.

1:08:52.169 --> 1:08:54.505
Lies. Don't lie to me!

1:08:56.799 --> 1:08:58.884
Would you like to read it?

1:09:11.313 --> 1:09:16.152
WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW OUR HEARTS
I'M SORRY. PLEASE DON'T LOOK FOR US.

1:09:16.861 --> 1:09:20.656
You don't want to believe it, do you?
You think it makes no sense, don't you?

1:09:23.993 --> 1:09:25.870
Oftentimes, the truth

1:09:26.996 --> 1:09:29.456
is more painful and shocking than any lie.

1:09:33.210 --> 1:09:34.461
Woo-jae…

1:09:39.258 --> 1:09:42.136
He left everything behind just for her.

1:09:43.679 --> 1:09:45.890
And I don't plan on
looking for him this time.

1:10:02.698 --> 1:10:04.658
If this turns out to be a lie,

1:10:07.578 --> 1:10:09.121
I'll kill both of you.

1:10:27.181 --> 1:10:29.350
<i>I just wanted you to know</i>

1:10:29.433 --> 1:10:33.729
<i>how brightly you used to shine…</i>

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:38.525
<i>and how…</i>

1:10:39.944 --> 1:10:41.695
<i>jealous I was of you.</i>

1:12:10.117 --> 1:12:13.495
How dare that crazy bitch do this to us?

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:17.249
She closed her bank account
and credit cards.

1:12:17.333 --> 1:12:20.044
Her phone has been disconnected
since last night.

1:12:20.627 --> 1:12:25.466
She already filled out a form to hand over
her art collection to the new gallery.

1:12:25.549 --> 1:12:28.677
And she only took the dashcam footage
leaving her car behind.

1:12:28.761 --> 1:12:30.971
Check thoroughly again.

1:12:31.055 --> 1:12:33.182
Make sure
she didn't take anything that's mine.

1:12:34.516 --> 1:12:37.227
Don't let any more news come out
about her disappearance.

1:12:37.311 --> 1:12:39.229
Get Li-sa ready to study abroad as well.

1:12:39.313 --> 1:12:41.982
People are going to gossip
about that bitch.

1:12:42.066 --> 1:12:43.692
She doesn't need to hear that.

1:12:46.236 --> 1:12:47.279
And you.

1:12:47.905 --> 1:12:49.698
Don't you dare go looking for her.

1:12:49.782 --> 1:12:52.576
Everyone needs to think
that we kicked her out!

1:12:53.911 --> 1:12:56.872
She should've knelt down
and begged for my mercy.

1:12:56.955 --> 1:12:59.458
How dare that crude bitch
run away instead?

1:13:00.250 --> 1:13:03.796
She's impudent to the very end!
What does she take me for?

1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:12.471
If anything,
I should be the one to get mad.

1:13:14.014 --> 1:13:15.182
So, please…

1:13:17.684 --> 1:13:18.977
be quiet.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:42.084
Hello?

1:13:44.002 --> 1:13:45.337
You're leaving today, right?

1:13:47.798 --> 1:13:49.174
Are you at the airport?

1:13:49.258 --> 1:13:50.134
<i>Yes, Hyeon-seong.</i>

1:13:50.759 --> 1:13:53.345
<i>Thank you for this. I'll do my best there.</i>

1:13:56.098 --> 1:13:57.307
And your sister…

1:13:57.975 --> 1:14:01.728
<i>We talked yesterday.
She said she wouldn't come to the airport.</i>

1:14:03.188 --> 1:14:06.817
You know how nonchalant she can be
once she makes a decision.

1:14:10.612 --> 1:14:12.239
Right. That's her.

1:14:15.367 --> 1:14:16.660
Have a safe trip.

1:14:19.163 --> 1:14:20.581
Call me when you get there.

1:15:26.897 --> 1:15:29.816
Have you gotten in touch with Mr. Seo?

1:15:31.068 --> 1:15:32.194
No.

1:15:33.487 --> 1:15:37.407
I'm sure you tried too.
That's probably why you reached out to me.

1:15:37.991 --> 1:15:39.576
We're quite flustered too.

1:15:40.369 --> 1:15:42.371
This is really affecting the project.

1:15:43.205 --> 1:15:44.957
Mr. Woo isn't happy

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:47.668
about all those rumors
going on around his project.

1:15:47.751 --> 1:15:51.672
I'll hand over all his work and drafts
regarding the project.

1:15:53.507 --> 1:15:55.217
You can remove his name.

1:15:57.636 --> 1:16:01.640
Please get rid of all his work
at the gallery too.

1:16:01.723 --> 1:16:04.560
But is that what he…

1:16:05.852 --> 1:16:08.230
He left before he could finish anything.

1:16:09.189 --> 1:16:10.524
It's the price he must pay.

1:16:12.067 --> 1:16:14.653
But still, what if he returns?

1:16:17.281 --> 1:16:18.365
No.

1:16:21.118 --> 1:16:22.911
He won't return.

1:16:54.443 --> 1:16:56.528
Hey, you picked up.

1:16:58.905 --> 1:17:00.657
You're leaving today, right?

1:17:00.741 --> 1:17:01.575
<i>Yes.</i>

1:17:02.117 --> 1:17:03.243
Well…

1:17:04.453 --> 1:17:07.706
You didn't throw out
the ticket I gave you, did you?

1:17:09.124 --> 1:17:11.043
No. It'd be a waste.

1:17:14.504 --> 1:17:15.547
I'll wait for you.

1:17:19.551 --> 1:17:22.220
Don't wait. I won't be going.

1:17:22.804 --> 1:17:25.390
Then I'll just come back.

1:17:27.517 --> 1:17:29.269
<i>Take care of yourself until then.</i>

1:17:30.228 --> 1:17:32.272
<i>And thank you for picking up.</i>

1:17:32.356 --> 1:17:34.941
<i>I wanted to see you one last time,
but I held myself back.</i>

1:17:38.570 --> 1:17:40.113
Do you still have time?

1:17:40.614 --> 1:17:41.448
<i>What?</i>

1:17:41.948 --> 1:17:44.159
Wait there. I'll say goodbye in person.

1:18:19.152 --> 1:18:20.654
<i>I totally forgot…</i>

1:18:22.197 --> 1:18:26.535
<i>that I was the very person
who took everything from you.</i>

1:18:33.625 --> 1:18:37.796
<i>As I expected,
will my story never have a happy ending?</i>

1:18:39.131 --> 1:18:43.301
<i>I wanted to forget everything
and start anew.</i>

1:18:44.302 --> 1:18:48.598
<i>My real story hasn't even begun yet.</i>

1:18:50.142 --> 1:18:53.770
<i>Is this how it all ends?</i>

1:19:04.823 --> 1:19:07.909
<i>I have yet to find any traces of her.</i>

1:19:09.035 --> 1:19:11.580
<i>The good news is that there haven't been</i>

1:19:11.663 --> 1:19:14.124
<i>any Jane Does around her age.</i>

1:19:14.207 --> 1:19:15.459
SEOUL, GYEONGGI MAP

1:19:15.542 --> 1:19:18.587
<i>It's quite probable
that she covered up her traces</i>

1:19:19.212 --> 1:19:20.630
<i>and left of her own volition.</i>

1:19:22.799 --> 1:19:24.718
<i>I'll look for her in other ways too.</i>

1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:26.261
Don't.

1:19:30.515 --> 1:19:31.725
Let's stop here.

1:19:50.285 --> 1:19:53.497
Have you really not heard from her?

1:19:59.711 --> 1:20:01.588
You came here for nothing.

1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:07.886
If she calls, please let me know.

1:20:08.512 --> 1:20:11.473
No. If she calls me, I'll--

1:20:11.556 --> 1:20:12.557
No.

1:20:14.100 --> 1:20:15.393
She won't call.

1:20:20.023 --> 1:20:23.235
She abandoned her own kids for some guy.

1:20:27.989 --> 1:20:29.825
I doubt she'll call her friend.

1:20:29.908 --> 1:20:33.036
I don't believe
that Hui-ju would leave for an affair.

1:20:34.704 --> 1:20:36.623
She poured her heart out to me.

1:20:37.415 --> 1:20:40.544
She truly regretted
what she had done in the past.

1:20:40.627 --> 1:20:42.921
Her feelings were genuine.
I can guarantee that.

1:20:44.673 --> 1:20:47.884
But she ran away with him out of the blue?

1:20:49.094 --> 1:20:50.387
That's not what happened.

1:20:51.429 --> 1:20:54.558
I'm sure there was another reason--

1:20:54.641 --> 1:20:56.268
I don't care about the reason.

1:20:56.351 --> 1:20:59.437
I don't care where she is
or whom she's with.

1:20:59.521 --> 1:21:00.438
Because--

1:21:04.734 --> 1:21:07.362
No matter how terrible the situation,

1:21:10.490 --> 1:21:15.161
it doesn't change the fact
that she left me without saying…

1:21:20.333 --> 1:21:22.168
a single word.

1:22:02.459 --> 1:22:06.129
I hope you're not still
wasting your time looking for her.

1:22:08.298 --> 1:22:10.634
We reported her missing
but still couldn't find her.

1:22:10.717 --> 1:22:13.887
She's determined to stay hidden
in this tiny country.

1:22:14.554 --> 1:22:17.974
Who knows? Maybe the rumors
about their committing suicide are true.

1:22:19.267 --> 1:22:20.310
I understand.

1:22:21.061 --> 1:22:22.145
Dad.

1:22:22.938 --> 1:22:23.813
Ho-su.

1:22:26.983 --> 1:22:28.026
Where's Li-sa?

1:22:34.824 --> 1:22:35.992
Li-sa.

1:22:37.118 --> 1:22:38.328
Will you…

1:22:42.874 --> 1:22:44.417
really be okay?

1:22:45.543 --> 1:22:47.796
Yes. I'm sick and tired of this place.

1:22:51.925 --> 1:22:55.553
Why would you ask her that now?
She'll only cause trouble if she stays.

1:22:57.806 --> 1:22:58.932
Ho-su.

1:23:00.308 --> 1:23:02.644
I'll fly over soon. I promise.

1:23:02.727 --> 1:23:04.062
Go first with Grandma.

1:23:07.315 --> 1:23:09.275
Due to a meeting,
I can't go to the airport.

1:23:09.359 --> 1:23:10.652
I'll visit next month.

1:23:34.551 --> 1:23:38.221
You're so relentless every morning.

1:23:39.222 --> 1:23:41.016
Lugging around that half-wit…

1:23:43.268 --> 1:23:45.645
Take good care of the hospital
while I'm gone.

1:23:45.729 --> 1:23:47.605
I'll fly back
as soon as the kids get situated.

1:23:47.689 --> 1:23:50.692
Don't you worry. Haven't I proven enough?

1:23:51.735 --> 1:23:53.403
You should've been like this sooner.

1:23:54.154 --> 1:23:56.656
But then again, you do take after me.

1:23:57.782 --> 1:24:00.910
You should go.
I have a directorate meeting to attend.

1:24:02.704 --> 1:24:04.330
Bye. See you during the break.

1:24:05.874 --> 1:24:08.043
Li-sa, make sure Ho-su takes his medicine.

1:24:18.678 --> 1:24:21.347
When will you put an end
to this pity party of yours?

1:24:21.431 --> 1:24:23.016
There's plenty of women lined up for you.

1:24:24.642 --> 1:24:25.602
Min-seo.

1:24:30.023 --> 1:24:30.982
Never mind.

1:24:32.859 --> 1:24:34.277
Will you be okay?

1:24:36.237 --> 1:24:37.989
Management was never your forte.

1:24:43.411 --> 1:24:47.290
With each gain, there comes a loss.

1:25:52.647 --> 1:25:57.235
A FEW YEARS LATER

1:26:05.827 --> 1:26:08.705
You have long, beautiful fingers.

1:26:09.956 --> 1:26:13.543
I used to be beautiful at your age too.

1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:17.422
You're still so young,

1:26:17.505 --> 1:26:20.592
why are you working here,
taking care of old people?

1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:25.513
I like it here.

1:26:25.597 --> 1:26:28.391
You like it here? Don't be like that.

1:26:28.474 --> 1:26:31.769
Go out there and enjoy your life.

1:26:33.479 --> 1:26:36.065
This is nothing short of a prison.

1:26:37.567 --> 1:26:38.693
There's nothing…

1:26:40.111 --> 1:26:41.696
that I can enjoy or have

1:26:42.906 --> 1:26:45.325
that's better than this.

1:26:45.408 --> 1:26:47.577
Goodness, gracious.

1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:51.206
If my legs were stronger,
I'd rush out of here in an instant.

1:26:52.248 --> 1:26:53.374
I'm sick of this place.

1:26:54.167 --> 1:26:56.419
Every day is excruciatingly long.

1:26:56.502 --> 1:27:00.298
That's why you should reconcile
with Jeong-suk.

1:27:00.381 --> 1:27:02.675
You always argue out of nowhere.

1:27:02.759 --> 1:27:06.137
She keeps rubbing me the wrong way.

1:27:06.221 --> 1:27:08.348
She only treats me well when she's happy

1:27:08.431 --> 1:27:10.516
and always complains about her life.

1:27:11.392 --> 1:27:15.313
No matter how old you are,
you still hate and get jealous, you know?

1:27:15.396 --> 1:27:17.982
But she's so self-centered.

1:27:18.650 --> 1:27:19.567
It's irritating.

1:28:25.717 --> 1:28:28.344
GU HAE-WON, FIRST SOLO EXHIBITION

1:28:31.139 --> 1:28:35.268
GU HAE-WON, FIRST SOLO EXHIBITION

1:28:45.862 --> 1:28:49.449
<i>And you had just begun your story.</i>
