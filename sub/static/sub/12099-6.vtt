I could remember when
it was <i>our</i> chili.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.261
All right, our chili,

11:03.262 --> 11:05.764
but our chili is perfect,
so don't mess it up.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.767
Leave that alone.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.268
What do you think, Sandy?

11:10.269 --> 11:11.770
I wouldn't know.

11:11.771 --> 11:14.774
They didn't offer a course in
chili dogs at Le Cordon Bleu.

11:17.276 --> 11:20.278
Saunders, why are you using
our good china

11:20.279 --> 11:21.780
at an outdoor barbecue?

11:21.781 --> 11:24.784
Because you can't afford
paper plates.

11:26.786 --> 11:30.789
Daddy, why do we have to eat
outside anyway, like peasants?

11:30.790 --> 11:32.791
I'm afraid that's what we are,
princess.

11:32.792 --> 11:33.792
We've run out of money.

11:33.793 --> 11:37.295
But Mother has money just
sitting in a bank or somewhere.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.297
That's right,
but only she can withdraw it,

11:39.298 --> 11:41.299
and she's being held prisoner
in some jungle.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.303
Which makes it a little tough
to get to the bank.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.805
Well, this is ridiculous.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.307
There must be some way
to get money.

11:49.308 --> 11:52.811
There is an extreme method that
people have been known to use.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.313
It's called working.

11:57.316 --> 12:00.318
Don't you think
I want to work, Saunders,

12:00.319 --> 12:02.821
to earn my daily bread
by the sweat of my brow,

12:02.822 --> 12:05.323
to work and toil

12:05.324 --> 12:09.327
like all the little common men
across this great land of ours.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.329
But I'm an ex-con.
No one will hire me.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.332
How fortunate for you.

12:14.333 --> 12:18.337
The men appreciate you coming
out to the field, cookie.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.840
We're tired of K rations.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.843
Hey, it's the least I can do for
the boys at the front, major.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.345
Carry on.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.351
You try some, Sandy.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.854
No, thank you.
I'll dine out.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.356
On what? You haven't been paid
in two weeks.

12:38.357 --> 12:41.360
Oh, I am judicious with money.
I've a tidy sum set by.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.363
Really.

12:46.365 --> 12:47.365
Saunders...

12:47.366 --> 12:48.867
Yes.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.369
I was wondering...

12:51.370 --> 12:55.874
See, we're in a spot here,
and I was wondering if maybe...

12:55.875 --> 12:58.877
Well... you know what I mean.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.880
No, I don't.
Clarify yourself.

13:02.882 --> 13:06.885
Well, I was wondering if
you could lend us some money.

13:06.886 --> 13:10.389
Excuse me,
while I consider your request.

Hi, Mary.
Where's Burt?

13:26.906 --> 13:30.408
He's out, you know, tracking
down the man who framed him,

13:30.409 --> 13:31.910
and trying to force him
to confess.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.411
Hopefully, he won't get killed.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.914
He said he would be by
after he did all that,

13:35.915 --> 13:37.917
or by 6:30,
whichever came first.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.920
Here's the potato salad.
Thanks.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.421
Mary, is that all you brought?

13:43.422 --> 13:44.423
Potato salad?

13:48.928 --> 13:51.931
Uh-oh, the party's over.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.434
Ooh, I'm sorry.
I guess I came at a bad time.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.436
I didn't mean to interrupt
your barbecue...

13:58.437 --> 13:59.438

14:00.940 --> 14:01.940
Hi.

14:01.941 --> 14:03.942
We haven't met.
I'm Annie.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.946
That's Leslie, the young woman
who was trying to kill my son.

14:09.448 --> 14:10.949
Hi, nice to meet you.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.952
It's nice to meet you too.
Are you a relative?

14:13.953 --> 14:15.955
No, a tramp.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.961
Hey, what do you got
in that there box?

14:22.962 --> 14:24.963
Another one of those bombs
that don't go off?

14:24.964 --> 14:27.465
There's a rattlesnake in here!

14:27.466 --> 14:29.467
Mm-hmm.

14:29.468 --> 14:32.470
Look, I really just came
to see Billy,

14:32.471 --> 14:34.973
so just go ahead with your
party and don't mind me.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.474
He's not in at the moment.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.977
He's out rescuing his mother.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.479
From revolutionaries
on a Caribbean island.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.481
Oh, nuts.

14:43.482 --> 14:44.515
Yeah.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.751
And I had such a great plan.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.319
I was gonna give this to him.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.321
I was gonna say
let's forgive and forget.

14:50.322 --> 14:51.823
And then he was
gonna open it up.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.492
And the rattlesnake was
gonna jump out at him!

14:54.493 --> 14:57.562
Wouldn't that have been great?

14:57.563 --> 15:01.567
Leslie, you have just got to
develop some other interests.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.070
It took me weeks
to find a rattlesnake.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.573
I looked all over,
nobody has any.

15:08.574 --> 15:12.744
Well, I... I guess
that's not your problem.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.313
It's been really nice
talking to you, Mrs. Campbell.

15:15.314 --> 15:16.815
Yeah.

15:18.817 --> 15:22.320
Well, once again,
I-I'm sorry for bothering you.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.322
See you soon.

15:24.323 --> 15:25.823
And don't try to follow me!

15:25.824 --> 15:28.326

and a hand grenade!

Leslie.

I don't believe it.
You just let her get away?

15:44.343 --> 15:45.343
That's it?
Which way did she go?

to Con-nect-i-cot?

Oh, no, I sent him to

18:05.684 --> 18:07.685
Oh, he'll come back, I'm sure.

turn out to be

18:32.211 --> 18:33.711

wanted me in your tent,
