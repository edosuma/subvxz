WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.471
All right, people.

00:04.537 --> 00:06.596
I don't have to tell you how important
this mission is.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.233
The targets should already
be familiar to you all,

00:09.309 --> 00:10.572
as should
your assigned roles.

00:10.643 --> 00:12.771
My assistant is distributing
your final itineraries,

00:12.846 --> 00:14.644
and some of the details
have changed, so let's review.

00:14.714 --> 00:15.647
Samson?

00:15.715 --> 00:16.774
Transportation,

00:16.850 --> 00:17.943
Have you acquired
a vehicle yet?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.418
Affirmative.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.455
Sphinx commandeered a limo on our
last job in Paraguay.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.511
Perfect.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.114
And, uh, good to have you back,
Samson.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.455
Hatred?
- Security! I'm to secure the --

00:26.526 --> 00:28.188
Sergeant, what the hell's going on
with your face?

00:28.261 --> 00:30.127
You like it? It's a big "v!"

00:30.196 --> 00:31.687
So, what are you --
"Sergeant Vatred" now?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.165
Nah, it stands for "Venture."

00:33.233 --> 00:34.724
I had the others removed --

00:34.801 --> 00:36.770
all except the for "D,"
'cause, let me tell you,

00:36.836 --> 00:39.237
that is a tender vittles
down there.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.967
- White?
- Aural enhancement.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.306
- Where's your equipment?
- This is all I need.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.969
- Orpheus?
- Refreshments.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.240
Now, I've acquired the recipe

00:46.312 --> 00:48.975
for an enchanting sort
of spiced fruit punch --

00:49.049 --> 00:51.143
Non-alcoholic, I presume.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.207
Of course.

00:52.285 --> 00:55.187
And for hors d'oeuvres,
we have vegan spring rolls.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.154
Vegan?!

00:56.222 --> 00:58.350
Come on, Orpheus!
Get with the program!

00:58.425 --> 00:59.791
I want to see pigs
in blankets.

00:59.859 --> 01:02.727
I want to hear fajitas sizzling,
comprende?

01:02.796 --> 01:04.196
And I got to have
my baked clams -- got to.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.322
Al?

01:05.397 --> 01:07.390
Decorating committee --
big surprise.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.402
- Status?
- Single but looking.

01:09.469 --> 01:10.562
Of the decorations.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.071
You got to give me
a bigger budget here.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.334
Uh, submit a petty-cash request
to my assistant.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.171
Billy, make sure you get receipts.
Twilight?

01:16.242 --> 01:18.074
Custodian?!
You got to be kidding me.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.409
All right, people.
We launch at 2100 hours.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.812
Synchronize watches.

01:21.881 --> 01:24.680
At my mark,
it'll be 17:01.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.380
No, 17:02, 17:03, 17:04 --

01:27.454 --> 01:29.355
Wait, that's
way too fast.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.685
Oh, I had it
in stopwatch mode.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.352
Okay, the time is now...
Tetris?

01:33.426 --> 01:34.416
Never mind.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.190
Everyone just be dressed
and ready in like an hour, okay?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.595
Any questions?
Yes, Dean?

01:38.665 --> 01:40.031
Um, what's our mission?

01:40.100 --> 01:40.965
Your mission?

01:41.034 --> 01:42.263
Your mission is to have

01:42.335 --> 01:43.997
the best goddamn
home-school prom

01:44.070 --> 01:47.063
$500 can buy!

01:53.713 --> 01:54.703
Gaw!

01:54.781 --> 01:56.841
It's like trying to drive
a green machine

01:56.916 --> 01:58.248
made out of cement.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.150
Why didn't we just
take one of the jets?

02:00.220 --> 02:01.779
'Cause if we're about to get
in a pissing contest

02:01.855 --> 02:03.084
with the O.S.I.,

02:03.156 --> 02:05.352
I want to be holding
the biggest pud we've got.

02:05.425 --> 02:07.360
So, you nervous
about going back?

02:07.427 --> 02:08.360
Why should I be?

02:08.428 --> 02:09.418
It'll be like all reunions,

02:09.496 --> 02:11.089
except this homecoming queen
got fat

02:11.164 --> 02:13.224
on red tape
and bureaucratic big macs.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.427
And she can have you
executed for treason.

02:16.169 --> 02:18.536
Not while we're hanging on
to the star quarterback.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.540
Still, this is really
kind of nice.

02:20.607 --> 02:21.597
What is?

02:21.674 --> 02:23.734
You know, just doing
a mission with you.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.938
You usually bring Brock
and Shoreleave.

02:26.012 --> 02:27.446
Well, they have
their own mission, so --

02:27.514 --> 02:29.642
And, yeah, I'll say it --
it hurts sometimes.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.708
But this --
this is nice.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.616
Eyes on the road,
Mr. Sensitive.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.314
Zip up that damn jump suit!

02:36.556 --> 02:37.785
Coming up on O.S.I. base.

02:37.857 --> 02:38.790
All right. Close enough.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.451
We still don't know
if this is a trap.

02:40.527 --> 02:41.290
Oh, come on.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.523
Some of the younglings
have never even seen her.

02:43.596 --> 02:44.894
All right, fine!

02:44.964 --> 02:47.024
Come and sit
on daddy's lap, kiddies.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.798
I give you the O.S.I.
Hover-quarters.

02:50.870 --> 02:51.929
Wow.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.234
Never seen nothing that big.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.831
It's beautiful.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.308
A city in the clouds.

02:56.376 --> 02:57.776
All right,
you had your eyeful.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.813
Pop the cloak and circle
at a safe distance

02:59.879 --> 03:01.313
'til I radio
the all-clear.

03:01.381 --> 03:02.371
Circle?

03:02.448 --> 03:04.474
It's like I'm driving
a flying housing project.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.782
I could maybe octagon.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.257
Set. Set. Check.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.487
Check one. Check.
Tisdale.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.359
Ashley Tisdale.
Check.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.022
Wait, you're playing
the Fun Boy Three version

03:18.097 --> 03:19.360
of "Our Lips are Sealed"?

03:19.432 --> 03:21.196
Ah, the Go-Go's are
a little stale.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.328
Oh, and Fun Boy Three
is springtime fresh?

03:24.404 --> 03:26.703
Plus, it's depressing.
It's a prom, not a funeral.

03:26.773 --> 03:27.672
All right.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.538
Just for that,
I'm not gonna play "Push It."

03:29.609 --> 03:30.668
But our dance!

03:30.743 --> 03:32.041
We've been rehearsing
all week!

03:32.111 --> 03:33.636
Ooh!

03:33.713 --> 03:37.309
An ice sculpture shaped
like our young graduates.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.147
How marvelous.
- AI's idea.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.585
But guess who had to shell out
two big ones

03:40.653 --> 03:42.315
for 20 gallons
of frozen water, hmm?

03:42.388 --> 03:43.651
Water!

03:43.723 --> 03:45.487
Oh, don't bother
spiking the punch.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.789
Been there, done that --
crème de menthe.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.829
- Ugh. Really?
- Why? What are you holding?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.024
- A little sambuca.
- Oh, hell, put it in.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.396
The more, the merrier,
I say.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.991
Just don't let Hatred
catch you.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.297
No, you're clear.
He's outside.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.736
He, uh, said we had
a security breach.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.569
That's it?

04:00.640 --> 04:02.438
You're just gonna
bury my skull here

04:02.508 --> 04:05.205
and declare this meeting
of The Midnight Society closed?

04:05.278 --> 04:06.405
It's not gonna work.

04:06.479 --> 04:07.606
It's symbolism,
you pus-nut!

04:07.680 --> 04:08.773
I have to convince myself
you're dead

04:08.848 --> 04:10.510
because you are killing me!

04:10.583 --> 04:11.983
I can't even
masturbate anymore.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.849
Every time I bring out
the lotion, it's "poof" --

04:13.920 --> 04:16.185
"Err, hey, bud.
Gonna rub one out, were you?"

04:16.255 --> 04:17.815
Dude, if you
solve my murder,

04:17.890 --> 04:19.483
I-I'll probably go away.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.222
I've been checking names
off your "Eye for an I" list, so...

04:22.295 --> 04:23.763
I've been checking off names!

04:23.830 --> 04:26.197
That's probably me as you,

04:26.266 --> 04:29.065
because you're dead,
and I am crazy.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.103
Damn it!

04:31.137 --> 04:33.265
Knock it off!
I'm bodyguarding here!

04:33.339 --> 04:35.934
And I'm securing the perimeter
of Sphinx headquarters.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.637
You broke my new scope!

04:37.710 --> 04:39.201
Scope? You pansy!

04:39.279 --> 04:41.111
I got a bead on you
<i>and</i> chubs over there.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.512
I can't believe
you need a scope.

04:42.582 --> 04:43.550
I don't need one!

04:43.616 --> 04:46.279
All right, smart guy!
See those wings?

04:46.352 --> 04:48.321
Watch this.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.588
Hey, I found something.

04:50.657 --> 04:51.886
The remote detonator!

04:51.958 --> 04:54.450
Just as Mr. Wendal foretold.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.223
So wise.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.628
Now you can get
the prints off of it

04:57.697 --> 04:59.029
and finally solve
the mystery.

04:59.098 --> 05:00.964
Yay!
- Uh, it's not a remote.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.593
It's a Matchbox dune buggy.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.103
Mm, better
than the van one.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.799
What kind of douche makes up
family-van adventures?

05:06.873 --> 05:08.239
I had a green Mercury
station wagon

05:08.308 --> 05:10.174
with two schnauzers
in the backseat --

05:10.243 --> 05:13.145
lamest matchbox car ever.

05:13.212 --> 05:13.975
What was that?!

05:14.047 --> 05:15.572
Nice shot, grandma.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.707
Why don't you just
run down there

05:16.783 --> 05:18.012
and toss the bullet at him?

05:18.084 --> 05:20.076
It was just a warning shot
over the bow!

05:20.153 --> 05:21.485
Yeah. Sure, it was.

05:21.554 --> 05:24.046
Maybe you could hit
the gigantic orange wings

05:24.123 --> 05:25.591
if he wasn't
wearing them.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.251
Oh, crap.
My ear's bleeding.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.920
What the fuck?

05:28.995 --> 05:31.089
Seriously, what the fuck?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.996
Ungh!
Double up -- ungh, ungh!

05:33.066 --> 05:34.364
Psh! Lucky shot.

05:34.434 --> 05:38.166
Okay, keep an eye
on them boots of his.

05:38.237 --> 05:39.136
I don't know.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.434
Maybe the metal corroded
or som-- whoa!

05:40.506 --> 05:41.337
Aah!

05:41.407 --> 05:43.808
Wait, what am I doing?
I'm already dead.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.301
And beautiful.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.369
Here, hon.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.678
Get one with Dean pinning
the corsage on her, will you?

05:49.749 --> 05:51.411
I'm gonna have a word
with the father.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.578
Hey, how the heck are you?

05:53.653 --> 05:55.485
I'm the Outrider --
Triana's stepdad.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.319
You must be Dr. Venture.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.882
Nope, just the bodyg--
uh, the driver.

05:59.959 --> 06:03.020
Uh, run into a little, uh, trouble
on the way, did you?

06:03.096 --> 06:03.927
Classified.

06:03.996 --> 06:07.455
Look, you got nothing to worry about,
Cowboy Dracula.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.434
This heap's
totally bulletproof.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.767
Your stepdaughter's perfectly safe
with us,

06:11.838 --> 06:13.431
as long as she doesn't
open the sunroof

06:13.506 --> 06:19.002
while violating
certain international treaties.

06:19.078 --> 06:20.671
Hey, you!

06:20.747 --> 06:21.806
What are you doing here?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.618
Hey, starry eyes.

06:26.686 --> 06:29.349
I just had to come see my girl off
in that lovely dress.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.015
You look just like a princess.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.025
Oh, you're so sweet.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.288
Oh, I want you to meet Dean,
my friend from back home.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.353
Dean, this is
my boyfriend, Raven.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.058
Boyfriend.

06:39.132 --> 06:39.963
Aah!

06:40.032 --> 06:40.863
Are you okay, bro?

06:40.933 --> 06:42.367
Are <i>you?!</i>

06:42.435 --> 06:44.370
Oh shit!

06:44.437 --> 06:46.338
Whoa!
Where'd you get the mouth?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.374
You like that?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.466
Yeah, thought I'd drop
a little "new Hank" on you.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.204
New Hank cusses.

06:52.545 --> 06:55.413
Oh, man,
this is just wrong, Rusty.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.972
Did you have a date
to your prom?

06:57.049 --> 06:58.176
I was a boy genius.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.776
I was the only 12-year-old
at my prom,

06:59.852 --> 07:01.377
so my date was my mother.

07:01.454 --> 07:02.513
Mine was worse.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.319
My prom date <i>was</i> to have been
Ms. Linda Lovelace.

07:05.391 --> 07:06.359
"Deep Throat"
Linda Lovelace?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.655
The same.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.093
She, of course,
by that time was

07:09.162 --> 07:11.791
a vocal anti-pornography advocate --
thanks, Dad --

07:11.864 --> 07:14.857
and sent her friend
Andrea Dworkin as her proxy.

07:14.934 --> 07:15.765
Was she hot?

07:16.736 --> 07:18.034
Google "Andrea Dworkin"
on an empty stomach one day.

07:18.104 --> 07:18.935
Oh, hello?

07:19.005 --> 07:21.998
Yes, I'd like six of your finest
whores, please.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.043
Fine, escorts.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.238
Yes, I think I'll go
for full service.

07:26.312 --> 07:27.871
Sure, I'll hold.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.609
Anyway, because my dad
brought like

07:29.682 --> 07:32.151
10 Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders
as his date,

07:32.218 --> 07:34.380
he didn't care that my date
was a huge, angry,

07:34.454 --> 07:36.446
"way smarter than
a 16-year-old me" woman

07:36.522 --> 07:38.047
who called me
"Little Half-man."

07:38.124 --> 07:40.059
Better than having your mom
as your date.

07:40.126 --> 07:40.957
It got worse.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.826
No shit, I ended the night
slow-dancing with H.E.L.P.Er.

07:43.896 --> 07:44.886
H.E.L.P.Er.

07:44.964 --> 07:45.932
Yes?

07:45.998 --> 07:47.557
Oh, lord, no.
That's way too expensive.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.431
Uh, what about half-service?

07:49.502 --> 07:51.334
What about just
a good-night kiss?

07:51.404 --> 07:54.636
On the lips? Cheek?
Just a hug?

07:54.707 --> 07:56.539
Okay, four of that,
two at half-service.

07:56.609 --> 07:57.577
Wait. What?!

07:57.643 --> 07:58.667
Just ask them!

07:58.744 --> 07:59.677
I'll pay extra!

08:00.780 --> 08:02.408
Do you have costumes?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.383
Hawkwoman.
- Girl!

08:04.450 --> 08:07.079
Hawkgirl?

08:10.223 --> 08:12.590
What's going on here?

08:12.658 --> 08:13.921
Cleaning?

08:13.993 --> 08:15.427
What is this?

08:15.495 --> 08:16.929
Uh, a Christmas list?

08:16.996 --> 08:18.430
"Ventures," "Brock"?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.024
Even you idiots are on this list
a-and I'm not?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.124
Give me that pen!

08:22.201 --> 08:23.760
Where's 21?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.828
He gave us $20
not to tell you

08:25.905 --> 08:27.840
he went
to the Venture compound.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.170
The Venture compound?!

08:29.242 --> 08:30.676
You want us to find him?

08:30.743 --> 08:31.506
Torture him?

08:31.577 --> 08:32.738
Cut out his eyes?

08:32.812 --> 08:34.474
Then pee in the empty
sockets?

08:34.547 --> 08:36.914
Aw, you want us to take
a whiz all over his brain?!

08:36.982 --> 08:38.006
What is wrong
with you two?!

08:38.083 --> 08:40.349
No, I don't want you to piss
on him, you sickos!

08:40.419 --> 08:43.048
21, unlike you weasels,
is loyal.

08:43.121 --> 08:44.818
If he's
at the Venture compound,

08:44.891 --> 08:47.019
I guarantee he's got
a good reason.

08:47.093 --> 08:48.220
Uppies.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.193
Let's go,
you little prowler.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.525
Come on. Wakey, wakey.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.130
What happened?

08:53.199 --> 08:54.827
Oh, you got smacked
in the flak jacket.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.028
Hurts like a bitch,
don't it?

08:56.102 --> 08:58.367
Uh, let me guess --
Sphinx headquarters?

08:58.437 --> 09:00.372
Was it the giant Sphinx?

09:00.439 --> 09:03.204
No, place smells like
out-of-work O.S.I. "D"-bags.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.744
I love it when you get
all toughie-pants.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.210
Whoops! Oh, I think
I'm chubbing up.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.542
Whoa!

09:07.613 --> 09:09.946
Wait, you guys are the ones
that kidnapped Monstroso?

09:10.016 --> 09:10.984
Sphinx!

09:11.050 --> 09:12.882
Aw, the Guild index
is lit up over that guy.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.215
I can't believe
you're holding him here.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.415
Maybe we are,
and maybe we're not.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.787
Being clever?

09:17.857 --> 09:19.951
No, tough guy, we're running
a Monstroso shell game,

09:20.026 --> 09:21.619
and I'm not sure where
the red queen is.

09:21.694 --> 09:22.718
Decoys?

09:22.795 --> 09:24.787
Aw, man, we never do
cool crap like that

09:24.864 --> 09:26.059
with the Monarch crew.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.259
Uh, because you guys suck.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.632
Hey, guess what --
brain-shampoo time.

09:29.702 --> 09:31.762
Gonna wash that man
right out of your hair.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.738
You will not remember a thing.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.469
Intruder at the front gate.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.569
The Sphinx has spoken.

09:39.645 --> 09:40.704
There's 15 of them.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.749
Or maybe 13 and a fatty
boom-ba-latty.

09:42.815 --> 09:46.013
Sphinx team, assemble!

09:49.989 --> 09:51.787
Really?

09:51.857 --> 09:53.086
Okay, where is everybody?

09:53.159 --> 09:54.525
Agent Samson's driving a limo,

09:54.594 --> 09:56.529
and everyone else is on Operation
Double Dumbo Drop

09:56.596 --> 09:58.997
with Colonel Gathers, sir!
- Great.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.591
Anywho, we have a level-two siege
at the front gates.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.602
You, rookie!
Stay here and watch the big man.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.400
Everyone else, grab a weapon
and a snack and follow me!

10:07.773 --> 10:08.866
Coming?

10:08.941 --> 10:10.603
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm short-staffed.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.201
Well, if you want,
I can kill you,

10:12.278 --> 10:14.270
unless you have a poison
tooth or something fancier.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.213
I'm Monarch crew --
if we get captured,

10:16.282 --> 10:18.444
our orders are not to tattle
on the Monarch.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.452
That is it.

10:20.519 --> 10:22.147
Then suit up, chubs.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:33.432 --> 10:34.695
Okay. So, I had
the table floating

10:34.767 --> 10:36.030
like a foot above
the ground, right?

10:36.102 --> 10:38.367
Then Raven goes,
"Did you see the guy's face?"

10:38.437 --> 10:40.099
So I look over,
and the other neophyte

10:40.172 --> 10:41.401
is lifting the chair!

10:41.474 --> 10:43.102
Isn't that hilarious?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.207
Raven. He checks up on me.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.509
A little clingy, isn't he?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.573
And look -- he already tweeted
that picture of us.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.745
So, um, how come your girlfriend
couldn't come tonight?

10:53.819 --> 10:54.878
What's her name?

10:54.954 --> 10:57.082
Uh, Tracy.
She had to work late.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.920
I thought the mall closed
at 9:00.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.017
And she had to go
to her grandmama's house after

11:01.093 --> 11:03.995
'cause she's sick
with mange.

11:04.063 --> 11:06.623
Uh, i-it's real nice of you
to cover for her, though.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.099
Of course, Dean.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.432
What are friends for?

11:15.541 --> 11:18.841
Oh, hell, no!
Not this crap again!

11:18.911 --> 11:21.574
Ah.
Your carriage awaits, m'lady.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.081
Ready to whisk you away

11:23.149 --> 11:24.981
to an evening
of prom enchantment!

11:25.051 --> 11:27.316
I am not in the mood
for this.

11:27.386 --> 11:30.948
I'm just your goddamn
postal carrier, you got it?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.252
We both know the score,
pretty mama.

11:32.324 --> 11:34.088
Don't fight this crazy love.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.924
Boy, I'm 46, okay?

11:35.995 --> 11:38.157
I have two sons
that are older than you.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.858
Age ain't nothing
but a number, baby.

11:39.932 --> 11:43.334
And isn't it high time those boys met
mommy's new beau?

11:45.738 --> 11:46.706
Hmph.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.263
Can't believe
you had them nozzle me.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.603
You're lucky we didn't
throw you in the brig.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.940
You got a lot of nerve
showing your mug back here.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.035
Yeah, yeah.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.273
What the hell happened here?!

11:54.346 --> 11:56.679
That's none of your concern,
Mr. Gathers.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.980
That's <i>Colonel</i> Gathers
to you, suit.

11:59.051 --> 11:59.916
Oh, yeah?

11:59.985 --> 12:02.386
Well, in that case,
I'm <i>President</i> Cardholder,

12:02.455 --> 12:04.856
and this is my associate,
<i>Emperor</i> Doe.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.017
God-Emperor Doe.

12:06.092 --> 12:07.253
Listen, you might be
king shit

12:07.326 --> 12:08.692
of the make-believe brigade,

12:08.761 --> 12:11.458
but you don't got rank
in the O.S.I. anymore, savvy?

12:11.530 --> 12:13.556
Oh! Hey! I'm in here!

12:17.002 --> 12:18.300
Come!

12:18.370 --> 12:19.998
Ah! Huh!

12:20.072 --> 12:22.166
The prodigal son returns.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.709
Take a load off, boy.

12:23.776 --> 12:24.766
Hmm.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.541
With my back to the door
in the bending bamboo seat?

12:27.613 --> 12:28.808
- Nice try.
- Aha.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.975
Caught me tryin' to get
all feng shui on you.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.951
Good eye, son.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.987
Take five, boys.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.216
Now, let's get down
to brass ticky-tacks.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.349
You're only standing here
sucking my oxygen

12:39.425 --> 12:41.451
because your little Sphinx outfit

12:41.527 --> 12:44.827
took something rightfully belongs
to the O.S.I.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.024
What's that --
your top agents,

12:46.098 --> 12:48.658
a cool 40 mil of the agency's
slush fund?

12:48.734 --> 12:50.362
Now, don't get wise, boy!

12:50.436 --> 12:52.598
You know dang well
I'm talkin' about Monstroso!

12:52.671 --> 12:54.902
That plus-sized
Hans Brinker's got his thumbs

12:54.974 --> 12:57.136
all stuck up
in the Guild's Christmas pie.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.201
That makes whatever plums
he pulls out --

12:59.278 --> 13:01.838
"ploink!" --
O.S.I. bidness.

13:01.914 --> 13:02.938
Little Jack Horner.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.575
Hans Brinker's thumb was,
uh, stuck in a dyke.

13:05.651 --> 13:08.018
Son, whatever depravity
you get up to on your own time

13:08.087 --> 13:11.023
is between you
and your living god.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.753
What I want to know is
where this Monstroso's at.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.021
He's someplace safe

13:15.094 --> 13:17.359
'til I give my men word
that I am satisfied.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.864
So, it's a negotiation, huh?

13:19.932 --> 13:20.831
All right!

13:20.900 --> 13:22.528
I'll wrestle you for 'em!

13:24.036 --> 13:25.868
Oh, you can have him,
you old son of a grizzly bear!

13:25.938 --> 13:28.203
We want a couple things
in return.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.470
- Then you better wrestle!

13:30.543 --> 13:32.842
We want our names cleared
from the O.S.I. wanted list --

13:32.912 --> 13:34.039
full clemency.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.378
And we want your sad-ass
undercover agents

13:36.448 --> 13:38.280
to stop trying
to infiltrate our group.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.613
Frankly, we're tired
of killing them,

13:39.685 --> 13:41.449
and we can't afford
the body bags!

13:41.520 --> 13:42.920
Now yield!

13:42.988 --> 13:44.923
Piss off, crap-o!

13:44.990 --> 13:46.481
Say it,
you unconscionable bastard!

13:46.559 --> 13:47.822
Uncle! Uncle!

13:47.893 --> 13:48.861
God damn it! Uncle!

13:51.430 --> 13:52.728
Whoo!

13:52.798 --> 13:54.460
There's one more thing.

13:54.533 --> 13:55.899
Best of three.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.436
No, no.
This one's a freebie.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.166
Couple of days ago,
we jacked Monstroso up

14:00.239 --> 14:01.434
with enough sodium pentothal

14:01.507 --> 14:03.772
to make an elephant tell us
where his graveyard is.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.209
And once we peeled him
off the ducts

14:05.277 --> 14:06.973
and got him to stop singing
"Climb Every Mountain,"

14:07.046 --> 14:09.242
he laid some
hot pillow talk on us --

14:09.315 --> 14:12.843
vis-à-vis Guild moles working
inside the O.S.I.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.251
Why, you...little...punk!

14:15.321 --> 14:17.085
O.S.I. is clean
as a whistle!

14:17.156 --> 14:18.818
Ugh!

14:18.891 --> 14:19.984
You're making me angry
now, boy!

14:20.059 --> 14:22.722
You wouldn't like me
when I'm -- ugh!

14:22.795 --> 14:24.161
General? G-General?!

14:24.230 --> 14:27.029
Get the hell away
from me, boy!

14:27.099 --> 14:29.330
Hey!
Step away from the general!

14:29.401 --> 14:31.267
Hey, now, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

14:31.337 --> 14:32.464
I had nothing to do with this!

14:38.210 --> 14:40.975
Did you buzz them already?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.378
Prom gig, huh?

14:42.448 --> 14:44.713
You guys play covers
or originals?

14:44.783 --> 14:47.309
Love the hoods, guys --
very Slipknot.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.651
The associates --
Monstroso's men.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.054
Who's the pudgy guy
with them?

14:51.123 --> 14:52.819
Great.
AI's in there.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.861
Oh, but how cute
is that kilt?

14:54.927 --> 14:55.895
He's like a little braveheart.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.156
I can take them
from the side.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.720
There's a part of the fence
that has less voltage.

14:58.797 --> 14:59.730
It's like a little tickle.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.096
Plus, I have a canister
of tear gas

15:01.166 --> 15:02.156
hidden in that tree
over there.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.668
Oh, you really have
this crap down.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.534
I've been storming this place
since the '90s.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.334
All right, signal me
when we bounce.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.499
Watch out for the cutie
in the kilt.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.564
He's one of the good guys.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.735
Dude, <i>I'm</i> not
a good guy.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.176
Oh, yes, you are.
Now scoot!

15:13.245 --> 15:15.680
Well, The Quymn Twins said
"stop calling us,"

15:15.748 --> 15:17.580
so I guess I'm still
stuck going stag.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.312
Hey, uh, you still
talk to your friend

15:19.385 --> 15:21.354
with the pipe cleaners
in her hair?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.319
Oh, Kim?

15:22.388 --> 15:23.788
Oh, she started hanging out
with the preppies.

15:23.856 --> 15:24.983
Next thing you know,
she's, like,

15:25.057 --> 15:26.685
in rehab in Florida somewhere.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.421
She's all, like,
Christian-y now.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.362
So, she's probably free tonight?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.331
Tracy's grandma
lives in Florida.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.391
Come on! Ugh! Friggin'!

15:35.467 --> 15:37.902
Aw, come on,
you friggin' piece of garbage!

15:37.970 --> 15:40.337
Ho-ho, nice!

15:40.406 --> 15:41.669
Which one of you
is the bride?

15:41.740 --> 15:42.799
It's not a wedding.

15:42.875 --> 15:43.899
It's home-school prom today.

15:43.976 --> 15:44.966
Pfft!

15:45.044 --> 15:46.740
That's like the only thing gayer
than a regular prom.

15:46.812 --> 15:49.008
Where you having it --
in those weird beds of yours?

15:49.081 --> 15:50.743
No, in the hangar.
You want to come?

15:50.816 --> 15:52.478
Can, uh,
Shallow Gravy play?

15:52.551 --> 15:53.814
- Please, no.
- Oh, God no.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.218
- Yeah! Great idea!
- Sweet.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.277
But we got to stop
so I can change

15:56.355 --> 15:57.379
and get the fog machine.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.424
Sweet!

15:58.490 --> 16:00.652
Now <i>I</i> got a date!

16:00.726 --> 16:01.989
That was excellent!

16:02.061 --> 16:03.051
Oh, my God!

16:03.128 --> 16:05.529
I've never worked with guys
that can actually do stuff.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.759
That was so sweet!
<i>So</i> sweet!

16:07.833 --> 16:10.530
Thanks for the assist.
Loved the fireball.

16:10.602 --> 16:11.729
Concentrated energy.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.774
I can do that with my hands.
Got a prom date?

16:14.840 --> 16:16.069
You asking?

16:18.177 --> 16:19.167
Great.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.008
I'm gone, and you guys
get all the action.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.878
Hey, Gary!
You coming to my prom?

16:22.948 --> 16:23.711
Hey. You want me to?

16:23.782 --> 16:25.375
You're not gonna do
anything stupid, are you?

16:25.451 --> 16:26.441
He's cool.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.009
Hatred shot him
in the breadbasket,

16:28.087 --> 16:29.555
and he still fought
like a chubby little tiger

16:29.621 --> 16:30.554
for Team Sphinx.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.557
All right,
but keep an eye on him.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.225
Dude! Where you going?!

16:37.296 --> 16:40.289
What, you'd rather hang out
with those guys instead of me?

16:40.366 --> 16:41.766
Flatleaver!

16:41.834 --> 16:42.824
24?

16:42.901 --> 16:44.631
Wha-- I'd know that voice
anywhere.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.467
38? Is that you?

16:46.538 --> 16:47.938
Holy crap, man!

16:48.007 --> 16:49.839
Long time, no --
21!

16:49.908 --> 16:51.809
This guy used to hench
for the Monarch!

16:51.877 --> 16:53.573
I can't believe
it's really you.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.136
I heard a rumor you died.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.581
38, it's not a rumor.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.448
I, uh --
I have some news.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.786
Oh, this is too good!

17:03.856 --> 17:05.790
21's diversion worked
like a charm.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.919
And his maps to the Venture
Compound have everything.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.121
According to this,

17:10.194 --> 17:12.164
this channel
leads right to the pool.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.722
Well, he's not answering
his comm-link.

17:13.799 --> 17:14.892
Because he's undercover!

17:14.967 --> 17:17.163
Oh, believe me,
he's expecting us.

17:17.236 --> 17:19.432
Monarchmobile
submersible mode!

17:19.505 --> 17:20.404
What are you doing?

17:20.472 --> 17:21.701
Engage the submarine
function!

17:21.773 --> 17:22.833
Uh, do we have that?

17:22.907 --> 17:24.376
Yes!

17:24.443 --> 17:26.674
All right, maybe I just
thought we did.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.042
H-H-Hit that button!

17:28.113 --> 17:30.446
Nice.
You turned the wipers on.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.644
Fuck it!
Hit the ejector! Abandon ship!

17:32.718 --> 17:34.243
Sweetie, we don't have an --

17:34.319 --> 17:36.015
What do we have?

17:36.088 --> 17:37.147
Cup holders?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.821
Oh shit we left our prisoner
in the trunk.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.194
And the paperwork!

17:45.264 --> 17:46.129
Go get them!

17:46.198 --> 17:47.723
Please?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.462
I don't want to get
my wings wet.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.297
Huh? Huh?

17:56.809 --> 17:58.675
Hunter!

17:58.744 --> 18:00.906
Over here, boy!
Clock your six!

18:00.979 --> 18:02.413
General!

18:02.481 --> 18:03.881
Gitchi manitou!

18:03.949 --> 18:05.247
Look at that shiner!

18:05.317 --> 18:07.183
I'm all kinds of sorry, boy.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.743
What are you clowns
doing to him?!

18:08.821 --> 18:11.188
Now, now, they're just
being good soldiers.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.690
I gave them orders
to restrain me

18:12.758 --> 18:15.353
whenever I have one
of my faintin' spells.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.520
What is it, sir --
your heart?

18:16.595 --> 18:18.723
Nah. This titanium ticker
will still be

18:18.797 --> 18:20.231
beatin' out Semper Fidelis

18:20.299 --> 18:23.030
when there's nothing left of me
but worm turds.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.094
What the hell happened
to you, sir?

18:25.170 --> 18:26.194
Aw, cripes!

18:26.271 --> 18:28.433
Didn't want you to have
to see me this way.

18:28.507 --> 18:31.204
Guess the cat's out of
the pajamas now, huh?

18:33.345 --> 18:36.281
All right, I might as well
level with you.

18:36.348 --> 18:39.841
I'm a hulk.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.911
Ah, there are
my guests of honor!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.256
Well, that was prompt.

18:47.326 --> 18:49.727
And may I say
that the Mayflower Madam

18:49.795 --> 18:51.661
has not lost her touch?

18:51.730 --> 18:52.789
Meow.

19:10.015 --> 19:13.008
Ah, let's just say
"very well off."

19:13.085 --> 19:15.316
We millionaires don't use
the word "millionaire,"

19:15.387 --> 19:17.015
but if <i>you</i> want
to say "millionaire,"

19:17.089 --> 19:18.523
I'm good with millionaire...

19:18.590 --> 19:20.024
Well, not quite
a TV <i>star.</i>

19:20.092 --> 19:22.118
More of a cartoon notable.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.287
I got our ass cancelled.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.830
Had a "Thundarr" lead-in,

19:24.897 --> 19:26.195
but we couldn't
hold the numbers.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.598
Maybe if you had
a fucking mock on the show.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.397
Ahh, we were too smart
for the room.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.802
And I'm just not over
that yet.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.238
Plus, I-I think I'm in love
with my boss's wife.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.606
Also, I'm starting to think
I'm not really villainous.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.939
Smooth.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.741
Now that
she's completely depressed,

19:40.812 --> 19:43.372
you should make her feel
your armpits for cancer bumps.

19:43.448 --> 19:44.939
Oh, my god! Go away!

19:45.017 --> 19:46.178
No, no, no! Not you.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.719
I'm talking
to my dead friend.

19:47.786 --> 19:49.584
So I have that...also.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.987
Come on, all the people
in the house!

19:51.056 --> 19:53.355
When I say, "hey,"
you say, "ho"!

19:53.425 --> 19:55.553
Hey!

19:55.627 --> 19:56.617
Hey!

19:56.695 --> 19:58.288
You suck!

19:58.363 --> 19:59.991
I'm not getting paid
for this, you know.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.795
I can't believe I'm here.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.029
I know. It's great!
The garage looks so pretty.

20:04.102 --> 20:05.764
Hank, it is a tard parade.

20:05.837 --> 20:06.896
Even your brother
thinks it's lame.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.304
Eh, he's just moping

20:08.373 --> 20:09.932
'cause his girlfriend
isn't really his girlfriend.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.135
No, I'm not!

20:11.210 --> 20:13.202
I mean...
yes, she isn't, but I...

20:14.213 --> 20:15.374
What does she see in him?

20:15.447 --> 20:16.312
Who, her dad?

20:16.381 --> 20:17.508
No, that Raven kid.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.744
Her -- her boyfriend.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.012
Well, let's see now.

20:20.085 --> 20:21.383
He's super-handsome --
I can say that --

20:21.453 --> 20:23.183
he's got cool hair,
cool clothes,

20:23.255 --> 20:25.486
and, worst of all,
he's a cyborg.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.820
No. I asked.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.326
She said
they're just crutches.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.258
Oh! Even worse!

20:29.328 --> 20:30.728
That means
he's a cripster, dude.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.230
He's rocking
a hipster angle

20:32.297 --> 20:34.129
<i>and</i> the sympathy angle
all in one!

20:34.199 --> 20:36.168
There's no way you can
compete with that!

20:38.237 --> 20:40.502
Oh, come on!

20:40.572 --> 20:43.337
D-Do I really have to get
blood on my tux?

20:43.408 --> 20:44.467
Service abandonment.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.273
Guild non-assail pact
of 1958,

20:46.345 --> 20:48.246
paragraph 20, line 17

20:48.313 --> 20:50.339
regarding employer's rights
to a deserter.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.439
Yeah, here's
all the paperwork.

20:51.516 --> 20:52.677
Now step aside.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.186
I don't care if you have
a note from Santa Claus!

20:55.254 --> 20:57.348
You are not getting in!
- Bup, bup, bup!

20:57.422 --> 20:58.856
I have a little
bargaining chip.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.322
Princess Tinyfeet!

21:02.394 --> 21:04.260
You untie her this instant!

21:04.329 --> 21:06.525
Uh...
we didn't tie her up.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.397
She's way, way into
the bondage thing.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.198
You want her back,
you better start respecting

21:11.270 --> 21:13.398
her <i>very</i> strange needs.

21:13.472 --> 21:16.442
Oh, my little beige bunny,
is that true?

21:16.508 --> 21:18.841
She insisted we drive her here
in the trunk.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.538
She is a freak!

21:20.612 --> 21:22.979
Now let us all in.
You have our henchman.

21:23.048 --> 21:23.913
All right.

21:23.982 --> 21:24.972
But you're gonna need
to change.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.383
You're, uh,
what, size Doc?

21:28.854 --> 21:30.015
Hello.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.822
Num-num-num-num-num.

21:32.891 --> 21:35.383
Oh, you like that,
don't you?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.156
How about I take you
to my boudoir

21:37.229 --> 21:39.391
and give you a little
Rusty Venture?

21:39.464 --> 21:41.262
Whoa!

21:41.333 --> 21:42.961
Denied!

21:43.035 --> 21:44.230
What was that about?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.168
Boom!

21:45.237 --> 21:47.331
Right out of the gate,
you ask for a Rusty Venture.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.932
That is bold, my friend!
Kudos.

21:50.008 --> 21:51.340
What? I have chilled bubbly
in my room.

21:51.410 --> 21:54.437
Uh, Rust, you do realize
that a "Rusty Venture"

21:54.513 --> 21:56.106
is when you take your finger

21:56.181 --> 21:57.774
and run it around a guy's asshole

21:57.849 --> 22:00.148
while you pull the guy off into his
own face.

22:00.218 --> 22:02.084
What?!
My name is a sex act?!

22:02.154 --> 22:03.417
When did that happen?

22:03.488 --> 22:05.286
Uh, like, in the '80s,
and Al is way off.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.292
A Rusty Venture is
when you 69

22:07.359 --> 22:08.759
and you fill each other's
mouth with cum

22:08.827 --> 22:10.659
and then you turn over
and blow spooge

22:10.729 --> 22:11.594
into each other's cracks.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.995
Good lord!

22:13.065 --> 22:14.658
How could that be named
after me?!

22:14.733 --> 22:16.565
W-What does that have
to do with me?

22:16.635 --> 22:17.796
Oh, don't play coy.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.633
Your cartoon was <i>huge</i>
in the gay community.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.004
We used to throw Rusty Venture
parties in the Castro.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.838
We'd all wear
little striped tops

22:23.909 --> 22:25.343
and tight little shorts.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.639
How did you not know this?

22:26.712 --> 22:28.237
Man, you're like
a little twinkie Cher,

22:28.313 --> 22:29.872
a ginger freaking
Liza Minnelli.

22:29.948 --> 22:31.177
No.
I missed this.

22:31.249 --> 22:34.344
I don't 69 guys
and do that spitting thing.

22:34.419 --> 22:35.910
That's not a Rusty Venture.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.182
That's a snake venom.

22:37.255 --> 22:38.917
You are misinformed,
my darling.

22:38.990 --> 22:42.017
You want to settle this,
maybe make a little wager?

22:42.094 --> 22:43.995
Fine, I'll bet you
a Rusty Venture I'm right.

22:44.062 --> 22:45.963
- Stop it!
- You are on!

22:46.031 --> 22:49.297
I am going to call an authority on both
subjects.

22:50.802 --> 22:54.204
Yello?
Mm. Mm-hmm.

22:54.272 --> 22:55.240
Oh, sure.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.333
I am the one who started that craze
back in P-Town

22:57.409 --> 22:58.843
with Tennessee Williams.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.037
It's brilliant!

23:00.112 --> 23:02.411
What you do is you take
a scuba snorkel,

23:02.481 --> 23:04.973
and you put your cock
in the wee bendy mouth part.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.518
Then you snake the other end

23:06.585 --> 23:08.315
right up your back address, okay?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.618
Then you just grab the middle
of that snorkel,

23:10.689 --> 23:12.157
and you're thick in
your own ass

23:12.224 --> 23:14.216
and pulling off your crank
at the self-same time

23:14.292 --> 23:16.557
until you spend
in your own jacksie!

23:16.628 --> 23:18.096
That's a Rusty Venture!

23:18.163 --> 23:21.224
Mischa! M-mischa, no!
Bad girl!

23:21.299 --> 23:23.165
Useless.
That was Colonel Gentleman.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.066
And?

23:24.136 --> 23:26.230
And the out-of-touch
old windbag

23:26.304 --> 23:28.136
just described
a double frog man.

23:28.206 --> 23:29.834
Ugh! Give me your phone.

23:30.942 --> 23:32.467
You? I told you!

23:32.544 --> 23:34.570
When your arch is terminated
by a third party,

23:34.646 --> 23:36.444
it's not our problem!

23:36.515 --> 23:38.643
What?
Of course I do.

23:38.717 --> 23:39.810
It's when you fist a guy

23:39.885 --> 23:42.218
and then you open up your hand
inside his ass and grab --

23:42.287 --> 23:43.846
No, no. He's laying down.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.914
Then whatever you come out with,
you rub on his --

23:45.991 --> 23:47.050
Wrong!

23:47.125 --> 23:49.185
The Rusty Venture
is a straight move.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.730
Okay, it's when you take a girl out
for a huge dinner

23:51.797 --> 23:53.390
but you don't let her
go to the can.

23:53.465 --> 23:55.024
Then you have
anal sex with her,

23:55.100 --> 23:56.591
and she craps
all over your dick

23:56.668 --> 23:58.136
so right when you're about
to get off,

23:58.203 --> 24:00.695
you take it out and you blow shit
cum on her back.

24:00.772 --> 24:01.933
That's a Rusty Venture?

24:02.007 --> 24:03.066
That's The Rusty part.

24:03.141 --> 24:04.234
The Venture part is
when you eat

24:04.309 --> 24:06.210
that junk off her back
without using your hands.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.769
Are you getting this?

24:07.846 --> 24:09.508
Yeah, I heard it,
and you're both wrong.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.413
To settle a bet.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.475
Yes, with Shoreleave.

24:13.552 --> 24:14.576
I don't care anymore!

24:14.653 --> 24:17.316
And, frankly, I'm disgusted
that my good name

24:17.389 --> 24:19.858
is being used for this --
this baloney!

24:19.925 --> 24:23.123
This is not over until one of us
gets a Rusty Venture.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.493
Agreed.

24:24.563 --> 24:27.897
I just don't understand
why you wouldn't tell me.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.435
If my squaw wants her man
to wear a ball gag

24:30.502 --> 24:31.834
and play it rough,
well, then, by golly,

24:31.903 --> 24:34.532
you are in for a whupping, missy!

24:34.606 --> 24:36.370
Prom! Unbelievable.

24:36.441 --> 24:37.602
This is so good.

24:37.676 --> 24:39.872
I can't wait to see
what 21 has planned.

24:39.945 --> 24:41.174
Oh, it should be good.

24:41.246 --> 24:42.339
You, uh, want to dance?

24:42.414 --> 24:43.780
Ah, maybe for a slow one.

24:43.849 --> 24:46.444
Home-school prom,
we are Shallow Gravy!

24:46.518 --> 24:48.282
And we are here
to melt your brain

24:48.353 --> 24:51.118
and expand your mind
with our heaviness.

24:51.189 --> 24:52.919
All right, don't forget
to check out our merch table.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.425
We have t-shirts and junk.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.791
Ch--
I need more of my monitors.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.921
Check! Ch--
Hank, stop fucking playing!

24:57.996 --> 25:00.329
Check, one. Check!

25:00.398 --> 25:01.696
Ch-- fuck it.
I'm going anyway.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.132
Two, three, four!

25:09.875 --> 25:11.639
- ♪ Yellow ♪
- ♪ jacket ♪

25:11.710 --> 25:13.042
- ♪ Straight ♪

25:13.111 --> 25:14.977
- ♪ Smoking ♪

25:15.046 --> 25:15.809

25:15.881 --> 25:16.814

25:21.953 --> 25:23.888

25:23.955 --> 25:25.116
And it all just comes
pouring out

25:25.190 --> 25:27.216
like somebody stepped
on a snack pack.

25:27.292 --> 25:28.920
So, after you find
the turkey baster,

25:28.994 --> 25:30.189
you both eat your way out
of the tub.

25:30.262 --> 25:33.391
That's what I heard,
at least.

25:33.465 --> 25:36.196
I don't know what goes on
at the Outrider's home,

25:36.268 --> 25:38.897
but I think I might need
to give him

25:38.970 --> 25:40.495
a stern what have you.

25:40.572 --> 25:42.837
All righty, there, major dad.
Take it down, okay?

25:42.908 --> 25:45.673
Now let's go get you
some more green punch.

25:45.744 --> 25:46.404
What?

25:46.478 --> 25:48.071
So, that's what
you and Raven do?

25:48.146 --> 25:50.911
He, uh, gives you
poop hand jobs?

25:50.982 --> 25:51.950
Um, no.

25:52.751 --> 25:54.743
That's what the urban dictionary
defines a Rusty Venture as.

25:54.819 --> 25:56.117
Well, maybe I should
have been

25:56.187 --> 25:57.382
more sensitive to your needs

25:57.455 --> 25:59.720
and rubbed poo-poo
on my pee-pee

25:59.791 --> 26:01.384
so you'd be more
interested in me!

26:01.459 --> 26:04.019
Because you're just <i>so</i> mature now,
aren't you?!

26:04.095 --> 26:06.428
Dean, I was willing
to go here with you as friends,

26:06.498 --> 26:08.490
but you're not acting
like a friend!

26:08.567 --> 26:10.229
You're acting
like an asshole!

26:10.302 --> 26:11.702
Oh, y-you don't like that?

26:11.770 --> 26:13.671
Well, maybe if I go to
the bathroom all over you!

26:13.738 --> 26:15.297
Okay, that's it.
Good night.

26:15.373 --> 26:16.602
Thanks for the awful time,

26:16.675 --> 26:18.371
and call me when you're not
a jealous little boy.

26:18.443 --> 26:22.539
Oh, well, maybe Raven can come
pick you up in his diapers!

26:22.614 --> 26:24.879
His poo diapers!

26:24.950 --> 26:26.509
Hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

26:26.585 --> 26:27.883
Just hold it still.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.444
You shake that,
and it'll explode,

26:29.521 --> 26:30.887
then blindness,
and possibly

26:30.956 --> 26:33.152
a mutant penis-like growth
on the contaminated area.

26:33.224 --> 26:34.214
- What?!
- Stop shaking!

26:34.292 --> 26:36.124
It's a mechanical hand.
How can it shake?

26:36.194 --> 26:37.389
Listen, do you know
what I had to go through

26:37.462 --> 26:39.124
to engineer the fly
that I get this crap from?

26:39.197 --> 26:40.028
Oh, god, no!

26:40.098 --> 26:41.862
D-D-D-Don't touch it!
It's fragile!

26:41.933 --> 26:43.902
And when it's mad,
it spits acid,

26:43.969 --> 26:45.562
and it's already mad
because I pulled its wings off.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.799
Spanish fly is actually
a blister beetle, you know.

26:47.872 --> 26:48.805
It's not even a fly.

26:48.873 --> 26:49.932
Yeah, thanks,
Wiki-Penis.

26:50.008 --> 26:52.000
We all know what
regular Spanish Fly is,

26:52.077 --> 26:54.842
but <i>this</i> is my special
proprietary blend.

26:55.914 --> 26:57.280
It'll take
that "No Way" Nancy

26:57.349 --> 26:59.477
and turn her
into a "Yes I" Candy.

26:59.551 --> 27:00.575
So, it's like a roofie?

27:00.652 --> 27:01.642
Don't cheapen it.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.349
What this does is temporarily mutate
the genital mound,

27:04.422 --> 27:07.187
changing it into a soft pink bag
of steaming desire,

27:07.258 --> 27:10.319
not unlike, say, a bonobo chimp's
pillowy catcher's mitt.

27:10.395 --> 27:11.920
Like a freaky
rainbow ass?

27:11.997 --> 27:12.828
That's a baboon!

27:12.897 --> 27:15.628
This is -- well, it's still freaky
but less colorful.

27:15.700 --> 27:16.895
This is starting
to sound dangerous --

27:16.968 --> 27:17.833
and a little creepy.

27:17.902 --> 27:19.268
Billy, stop
being a wuss.

27:19.337 --> 27:20.771
This is superscience,

27:20.839 --> 27:23.104
and this superscientist
has been shut down all night

27:23.174 --> 27:24.767
by whores!

27:24.843 --> 27:25.833
Oh, no! Oh!

27:25.910 --> 27:27.173
It's -- it's starting
to foam up now!

27:27.245 --> 27:28.907
No, that's a good sign.
Is the bottle hot?

27:28.980 --> 27:30.972
It's a-a mechanical hand!
I can't tell!

27:31.049 --> 27:33.678
Okay.
Now shake it!

27:33.752 --> 27:35.744
No way, jose!
I'm not gonna shake it!

27:35.820 --> 27:37.516
You told me
not to shake it!

27:37.589 --> 27:39.649
Yeah, it started
a couple months back --

27:39.724 --> 27:41.090
kind of embarrassing.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.593
But I first
discovered the problem

27:42.661 --> 27:45.324
during a session
of sexual congress.

27:45.397 --> 27:48.390
There I am,
ridin' high in the saddle,

27:48.466 --> 27:50.458
when I look down
and I notice my, uh --

27:50.535 --> 27:53.369
my flag's stuck
at half mast,

27:53.438 --> 27:55.339
if you know
what I'm sayin'.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.399
So I drag my old glory
down to sick bay

27:57.475 --> 28:00.172
so them quacks can do
a little recon.

28:00.245 --> 28:02.476
They tell me I got
a big old stowaway

28:02.547 --> 28:04.846
hidin' down in my bilge.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.077
Hmm. Malignant?

28:06.151 --> 28:07.779
Downright malevolent!

28:07.852 --> 28:09.218
Doctors said my only hope

28:09.287 --> 28:12.121
was a radical course
of radiation therapy.

28:12.190 --> 28:15.024
So we belted the sumbitch
with gamma rays!

28:15.093 --> 28:17.688
General, it's time
for your special

28:17.762 --> 28:20.027
hulk-suppressant
medicine, sir.

28:20.098 --> 28:21.122
Naptime!

28:21.199 --> 28:23.395
Don't go tellin' nobody
about this, son.

28:23.468 --> 28:25.061
Don't tell Washington.

28:25.136 --> 28:26.661
Don't tell Secret President.

28:26.738 --> 28:27.797
Promise me.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.467
Of course, sir.
I promise.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.068
Hmph.
Unbelievable.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.373
That's 'cause it's bullshit,

28:34.446 --> 28:35.971
bunch of funny-book
flapdoodle.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.242
Treister's had it.

28:37.315 --> 28:38.408
The big "C's"
eating him alive.

28:38.483 --> 28:39.917
Ain't no dignity
going out like that.

28:39.984 --> 28:42.681
Old war-horse like him
wants to die with his boots on.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.222
So, in order to make him think

28:44.289 --> 28:46.781
he's been wrecking the town
with the power of a bull...

28:46.858 --> 28:48.759
We wreck his office
with the power of our fists

28:48.827 --> 28:50.557
and a couple of chairs.

28:50.628 --> 28:52.426
Geez.
I-I had you two all wrong.

28:52.497 --> 28:54.728
That is...
weirdly noble of you.

28:54.799 --> 28:55.664
Too true.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.101
It's also the only way to get
the other agents to help.

28:58.169 --> 28:59.398
So when we tell Washington

28:59.471 --> 29:00.803
the old man's
so bat shit crazy

29:00.872 --> 29:02.238
he thinks
he's a friggin' hulk,

29:02.307 --> 29:04.503
they turn the O.S.I. over
to the next in line.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.737
Namely us.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.369
Why, you double-crossing --

29:07.445 --> 29:09.073
Y-You're the double agents,
aren't you?!

29:09.147 --> 29:10.638
Sons of bitches!

29:10.715 --> 29:12.013
Sky Pilot, abort!

29:12.083 --> 29:13.813
Brando's
got us on our bellies,

29:13.885 --> 29:15.046
and he's reaching
for the butter!

29:15.120 --> 29:16.088
Sky Pilot!

29:27.031 --> 29:29.330
Dude, what the fuck
are you doing?!

29:29.400 --> 29:30.800
You're sleeping with
the enemy!

29:30.869 --> 29:32.098
I thought this was about me.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.297
Stop already!

29:33.371 --> 29:35.135
Oh, my god, dude!
It's over.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.072
I love you,
but it's over.

29:37.142 --> 29:40.010
I love you, too!
Come get a hug!

29:40.078 --> 29:41.671
No, no. Not you.
I'm talking to my dead friend.

29:41.746 --> 29:42.770
Oh, a ghost!

29:42.847 --> 29:44.247
T-That's my game!
Where is he?

29:44.315 --> 29:45.908
You don't see him?

29:45.984 --> 29:47.680
Is it Bruce Willis?

29:47.752 --> 29:50.745
I-It's 24 and his dead adviser,
Mr. Wendal,

29:50.822 --> 29:53.155
who's that guy from the Arrested
Development video.

29:53.224 --> 29:56.251
Mr. Wendal?
You mean Baba Oje?

29:56.327 --> 29:57.920
Their adviser --
the old guru guy

29:57.996 --> 29:59.862
that sits in the chair
the whole video.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.092
That <i>was</i> Baba Oje!

30:01.166 --> 30:02.691
The titular Mr. Wendal
was a homeless man.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.066
He's lying!
This is Mr. Wendal!

30:05.136 --> 30:07.503
Jefferson! Jefferson!

30:07.572 --> 30:10.041
Orpheus!
She's from the south side!

30:10.108 --> 30:11.770
We were almost neighbors!

30:11.843 --> 30:12.776
Super!

30:12.844 --> 30:16.178
Hey, is Baba Oje
still alive?

30:16.247 --> 30:17.647
The Arrested Development guy?

30:17.715 --> 30:18.683
Yes!

30:18.750 --> 30:20.218
Yeah!
You want to invite him?

30:20.285 --> 30:22.117
He's a blast!
We should invite him!

30:22.187 --> 30:23.621
He'd love this.

30:23.688 --> 30:24.712
He's not Mr. Wendal?

30:24.789 --> 30:26.280
He's not even dead?

30:26.357 --> 30:29.521
Dude, Mr. Wendal isn't...
dead.

30:29.594 --> 30:31.358
They're -- they're gone.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.190
Oh, yes.
Oh, there's that hug.

30:35.266 --> 30:37.360
Gone.

30:37.435 --> 30:38.801
Gone but not forgotten.

30:38.870 --> 30:41.567
Perhaps they'll reunite again.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.164
They were so good.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.369
I miss that band, too.

30:45.443 --> 30:47.378
Mm.

30:47.445 --> 30:50.210
I'm gonna give you
a Rusty Venture.

30:50.281 --> 30:51.647
Don't believe
the hype.

30:51.716 --> 30:52.775
A Rusty Venture is the name

30:52.851 --> 30:54.046
for when you jerk off so much

30:54.118 --> 30:55.814
your dick gets
all red and sore.

30:55.887 --> 30:57.219
Really?

30:57.288 --> 30:58.415
Yeah, but, I'll, uh,
let you give me

30:58.489 --> 30:59.479
an Action Johnny, though.

30:59.557 --> 31:01.719
Ooh! What's that?

31:01.793 --> 31:03.318
I'll show you.

31:03.394 --> 31:05.260
Beat it, rookie.
I need the room.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.231
Aah!

31:13.104 --> 31:15.005
Do you want to live?

31:15.073 --> 31:16.735
Y-Yes.

31:16.808 --> 31:19.539
Then I suggest you return
to your little party.

31:27.452 --> 31:28.385
Ugh!

31:28.453 --> 31:30.046
Great.
So much for my backup.

31:30.121 --> 31:32.488
Hey, you're the one who told me
to keep circling.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.150
You know how much fuel
that thing burns?

31:34.225 --> 31:35.659
Whatever!
Where's the rest of the team?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.662
They ejected just in time.

31:37.729 --> 31:38.560
Good!

31:38.630 --> 31:39.825
Let's just hope they can
make it back to base

31:39.898 --> 31:41.093
and rally
Brock and Shoreleave.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.497
Great. Them again.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.092
Damn it, this is no time
for your -- wait!

31:44.168 --> 31:46.433
What about Monstroso?
- Safe and sound.

31:46.504 --> 31:47.904
Crash didn't even
wake him up.

31:47.972 --> 31:49.440
He was still on board?!

31:49.507 --> 31:51.738
He was our only hope,
you buffoon!

31:51.809 --> 31:53.573
He is the only other
living soul

31:53.645 --> 31:55.671
who knew the identity
of those double agents!

31:55.747 --> 31:57.909
Oh. Well, then, those guys
probably aren't gonna

31:57.982 --> 31:59.746
let him live much longer.

31:59.817 --> 32:01.115
Gee, you think?!

32:01.185 --> 32:03.177
Colonel Gathers,
your presence is requested

32:03.254 --> 32:05.450
on the bridge.

32:05.523 --> 32:07.515
Not that bridge, sir.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.753
Secret one.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.021
All right, Dean, first off,

32:10.094 --> 32:11.960
that girl is
<i>way</i> too hot for you.

32:12.030 --> 32:14.295
But if you want to get her back,
you can't sit here.

32:14.365 --> 32:15.924
You've got to go
get her back.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.593
How?

32:17.669 --> 32:19.865
Hank, you over this lame
excuse for a prom yet?

32:19.938 --> 32:22.271
Come on, kids!
Conga line!

32:22.340 --> 32:24.400
♪ Yada, yada, da, da! ♪

32:24.475 --> 32:25.738
All right.
I'm over it.

32:25.810 --> 32:28.644
Let's get Dean
his fake girlfriend back.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.409
Come on,
we got to do it.

32:30.481 --> 32:32.450
Dermott, you want in?

32:32.517 --> 32:35.510
Go, Team Venture!

32:37.822 --> 32:40.451
Ah, loving
the disguise, 21.

32:40.525 --> 32:41.993
All right,
let's do this thing.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.756
I'm ready to explode
all over this place.

32:43.828 --> 32:45.558
Dude, I'm not arching.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.690
I-I came here
to bury 24's skull

32:47.765 --> 32:49.927
so he'll stop watching me
masturbate.

32:50.001 --> 32:51.333
Please tell me
you're messing with me.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.893
Say,
"Monarch, I'm kidding.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.167
Let's burn this lame prom
to the ground."

32:55.239 --> 32:56.104
So not.

32:56.174 --> 32:57.972
And let me tell you,
these people are helping.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.671
I'm not sure how to say this, but...
I like them.

33:00.745 --> 33:01.872
Oh, my god,
they drugged you!

33:01.946 --> 33:03.141
Anti-truth serum!

33:03.214 --> 33:05.115
Stick your hand down your throat
and induce vomiting!

33:05.183 --> 33:07.118
I'm not drugged!
I'm quitting.

33:07.185 --> 33:08.517
Ugh, don't drink the punch.

33:08.586 --> 33:10.680
There's either peppermint schnapps
or mouthwash in it.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.087
21's bailing on us.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.283
- What?!
- Ask him.

33:13.358 --> 33:14.724
Oh, it's true!
I'm sick of this!

33:14.792 --> 33:16.317
I'm slightly drunk,

33:16.394 --> 33:18.693
I'm talking to a ghost
of my fucking dead friend,

33:18.763 --> 33:21.494
I'm probably in love with you,
and so, yeah, whatever!

33:21.566 --> 33:22.829
I'm over it!
- You're "over it"?

33:22.900 --> 33:24.300
- You're in love with me?
- Whoa! Wait, what?

33:24.369 --> 33:26.668
We made out.
- W-Well, that's a stretch.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.764
We got drunk,
and maybe we kissed, but...

33:28.840 --> 33:30.536
Sure, you did.
Where was I then, huh?

33:30.608 --> 33:32.008
Where were you?
You were there!

33:32.076 --> 33:34.204
We were on top of you!

33:34.278 --> 33:36.804
We made out on you!

33:36.881 --> 33:38.474
Fight! There's a fight!

33:38.549 --> 33:39.812
So we had a drunken
threesome!

33:39.884 --> 33:41.648
Join the fucking club!

33:41.719 --> 33:44.712
We're villains, you crybaby!
We swing!

33:44.789 --> 33:46.815
I've watched my wife
suck Manta Claus dry

33:46.891 --> 33:48.484
and then
make him breakfast!

33:48.559 --> 33:50.551
- Is that true?
- Eggs and buttered toast.

33:50.628 --> 33:52.597
Wha-- you g--
you guys are nuts!

33:52.663 --> 33:54.154
Yeah, great! Fuck you!

33:54.232 --> 33:56.758
Fuck this completely crappy
fucking excuse

33:56.834 --> 33:58.359
for a fucking prom!

33:58.436 --> 34:00.337
What are you guys
looking at?

34:00.405 --> 34:01.566
Oh, oh.

34:01.639 --> 34:03.164
Did I spoil
your little prom?

34:03.241 --> 34:05.335
Well, you have just
felt the sting

34:05.410 --> 34:07.572
of the mighty Monarch!

34:07.645 --> 34:09.841
Again, Dr. Venture,
we have bested you!

34:09.914 --> 34:14.443
Good night
and unpleasant dreams!

34:18.889 --> 34:20.755
Honey...

34:20.824 --> 34:22.123
is that you?

34:22.193 --> 34:23.855
Yes. Come on.

34:23.928 --> 34:25.954
You're gonna blow
the dramatic exit.

34:29.434 --> 34:31.699
Huh?

34:31.768 --> 34:33.737
Aaaah!

34:33.804 --> 34:35.864
Shoreleave, code red!

34:35.940 --> 34:36.908
We got a fox
in the hen house,

34:36.974 --> 34:38.272
and the jumbo eggs
are gone!

34:38.342 --> 34:40.436
Shoreleave!

34:40.511 --> 34:42.309
Aaah!

34:51.022 --> 34:53.321
Aaaah!

35:04.135 --> 35:05.728
Aim for the tires!

35:05.803 --> 35:07.066
I'm on it!

35:07.138 --> 35:10.404
Yah!

35:10.475 --> 35:11.875
Nice shot, Queen Midas.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.309
Now she's got
money for tolls.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.039
I'll take care of this.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.911
This has been
a long time coming.

35:16.981 --> 35:19.416
Me and her got to get something
straight between us.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.476
You think he even knows

35:21.552 --> 35:23.919
how many double entendres
that was?

35:23.988 --> 35:25.115
<i>Halt!</i>

35:25.189 --> 35:27.886
<i>You are too close</i>
<i>to the Conjectu-Cycle.</i>

35:27.959 --> 35:29.257
<i>This vehicle</i>
<i>is protected by --</i>

35:31.395 --> 35:33.455
First off,
you gotta get yourself

35:33.531 --> 35:34.555
into some Goth clothing.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.897
Yeah, she likes that --
that and cripples,

35:36.968 --> 35:38.334
so we should break
your legs, too.

35:38.402 --> 35:39.495
You're not gonna break
my legs.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.902
Okay, then check this out.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.100
Hank and I are gonna write her name
on the lawn with logs.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.803
Then we're gonna friggin'
light it on fire!

35:45.877 --> 35:47.743
You're gonna be all
gothed-out standing there,

35:47.812 --> 35:50.145
and there's gonna be
this huge wall of flames,

35:50.214 --> 35:51.409
and you're gonna be
like the Crow.

35:51.482 --> 35:55.544
She's gonna see that shit
and cream herself.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.316
Aaaaah!

36:34.759 --> 36:37.228
What, leaving the prom
so soon?

36:37.295 --> 36:41.460
Don't you want to stay and see who
they crown king and queen?

36:52.743 --> 36:54.041
Come on in, boy.

36:54.111 --> 36:56.080
Don't be shy, now.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.775
This is the real bridge,
huh?

36:57.848 --> 36:58.679
I always thought they kept

36:58.749 --> 37:00.843
the spare cadet linens
down here.

37:00.918 --> 37:04.355
Nothing's ever what it seems --
first rule of espionage.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.323
Here, take the wheel a minute,
will you?

37:06.390 --> 37:09.758
There you go.
Nice and easy.

37:09.827 --> 37:11.352
It's relaxing, ain't it?

37:11.429 --> 37:13.091
Doctors say a man
with my condition's

37:13.164 --> 37:15.429
got to keep himself relaxed.

37:15.499 --> 37:17.024
About your condition,
General --

37:17.101 --> 37:18.694
Cardholder and Doe
have been lying to you.

37:18.769 --> 37:20.237
You're -- you're not a hulk.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.169
Soldier, I may be
a crazy old S.O.B.,

37:23.241 --> 37:25.107
but I ain't
no short-busser.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.873
I know there ain't no such
things as hulks.

37:27.945 --> 37:29.470
Oh.
Well, that's not all, sir.

37:29.547 --> 37:30.776
Cardholder and Doe --

37:30.848 --> 37:33.784
Are double agents angling
to take over the O.S.I.?

37:33.851 --> 37:35.410
Yep. Know that, too.

37:35.486 --> 37:38.923
Hell, son, I invented
the secret-keepin' business.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.687
And when them slippery
son-o'-bitches try

37:41.759 --> 37:43.455
to take out Monstroso,

37:43.527 --> 37:46.986
they're in
for a bellyful of surprise.

37:47.064 --> 37:50.000
You might could say
I got a man on the inside.

37:50.067 --> 37:51.729
Several.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.600
Think you know 'em.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.037
Sky pilot?

37:55.106 --> 37:56.438
So, he's working for <i>you?</i>

37:56.507 --> 37:59.409
Not no more.
I am officially retired.

37:59.477 --> 38:00.638
I got the pee-pee cancer,

38:00.711 --> 38:04.409
and there ain't a thing on earth
nobody can do to fix me.

38:04.482 --> 38:07.975
So I'm fixing to shuffle off
this mortal coil.

38:08.052 --> 38:10.317
W-Wait a minute!
What the hell are you doing?!

38:10.388 --> 38:11.822
Do not let go
of that wheel, boy!

38:11.889 --> 38:13.152
There are 2,000 souls
on board!

38:13.224 --> 38:14.522
What about the O.S.I.?

38:14.592 --> 38:16.117
Y-You've worked your whole life
for this place, General.

38:16.193 --> 38:18.162
Now you're just
gonna abandon it?

38:18.229 --> 38:19.561
Nah. From where I sit,

38:19.630 --> 38:22.759
looks like the old gal's
in pretty good hands.

38:22.833 --> 38:25.029
Took guts
to bust out the nest

38:25.102 --> 38:26.934
and go off
on your own, son.

38:27.004 --> 38:28.597
Took balls to...

38:28.673 --> 38:30.642
cut off your balls.

38:30.708 --> 38:34.907
Even without 'em, you got more true
grit man-moxie on tap

38:34.979 --> 38:37.448
than any of these "yes" men
and bureaucrats

38:37.515 --> 38:39.177
been runnin' the place.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.775
No, no!
General, I'm not!

38:40.851 --> 38:42.046
You'll do fine.

38:42.119 --> 38:43.109
Do not kill yourself,
you crazy bastard!

38:43.187 --> 38:45.122
Ain't killin' myself, son.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.954
I said there ain't nothin' they could do
for me on this earth.

38:48.025 --> 38:51.223
But there is one thing
might could cure me...

38:51.295 --> 38:56.256
alien technology!

39:00.838 --> 39:03.205
All right, all right,
all right!

39:03.274 --> 39:06.267
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for --

39:06.344 --> 39:09.678
the crowning of the prom king
and...king.

39:09.747 --> 39:11.682
We so have this.
How do I look?

39:11.749 --> 39:13.684
Hank and Dean Venture!

39:13.751 --> 39:15.447
Oh, they deserve it.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.545
Hank and Dean Venture!

39:17.621 --> 39:18.850
Come on up, fellas.

39:18.923 --> 39:20.482
Come and get those crowns.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.823
Okay, well, uh,

39:22.893 --> 39:24.122
it looks like the crowns
will have to go

39:24.195 --> 39:26.164
to the second runner-ups,
then.

39:26.230 --> 39:28.222
With four votes,

39:28.299 --> 39:30.632
Sergeant Hatred
and Princess Tinyfeet.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.602
Oh, come on!

39:32.670 --> 39:34.332
♪ Don't bother saying
you're sorry ♪

39:37.608 --> 39:40.635
♪ why don't you come and... ♪

39:49.453 --> 39:51.012
Ugh.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.716
Well, well, well.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.349
Here we are again.

39:54.425 --> 39:56.326
How long are we gonna
keep doing this, Mol --

39:56.394 --> 39:58.260
till we're old and gray, huh?

39:58.329 --> 40:00.855
Every year, we pretend to try
to kill each other.

40:00.931 --> 40:02.695
You know neither of us
will actually do it.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.861
Speak for
yourself, Samson.

40:04.935 --> 40:06.836
Oh, looking for this?

40:06.904 --> 40:07.928
Hmm.

40:08.005 --> 40:10.031
We seem to be at, uh --

40:10.107 --> 40:12.599
how you say --
stalemate.

40:12.676 --> 40:13.837
Not from where I sit.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.277
Ah, give it up, Mol.

40:15.346 --> 40:18.544
You got nowhere to go but down,
and you know why?

40:18.616 --> 40:21.780
Because you are
a bad person.

40:21.852 --> 40:24.117
You don't know the first thing
about duty

40:24.188 --> 40:26.282
or honor or friendship.

40:26.357 --> 40:29.885
You're just a cold-hearted
mercenary bitch!

40:29.960 --> 40:32.054
I'm tired of spending
my life chasing you.

40:32.129 --> 40:34.394
What if I told you it wasn't
for money this time?

40:34.465 --> 40:36.900
What if I told you I've...

40:36.967 --> 40:39.300
changed?

40:39.370 --> 40:40.201
What?

40:40.271 --> 40:42.240
For reals, or is this another one
of your tricks?

40:42.306 --> 40:46.710
No, Samson.
It is the real thing.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.109
Nyet!

40:48.179 --> 40:50.512
Wha-- oh, for God's --
come on!

40:50.581 --> 40:51.640
You said you changed!

40:51.715 --> 40:53.547
You misunderstand, Samson.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.882
I am, uh,
how you say --

40:55.953 --> 40:57.251
taken.

40:57.321 --> 40:59.688
What?! By who?!

40:59.757 --> 41:00.747
Him?!

41:00.825 --> 41:03.317
Oh, you got to be
kidding me!

41:03.394 --> 41:04.794
It is like you say.

41:04.862 --> 41:07.923
I am bad person.
So is he.

41:07.998 --> 41:10.991
He is also rich, powerful,
and quite well-endowed.

41:11.068 --> 41:14.266
Aaaah! All right!
Enough!

41:14.338 --> 41:15.897
Well, I won't let you go.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.601
It's not
your choice, Brock.

41:17.675 --> 41:18.836
No, I-I don't mean
"let you go"

41:18.909 --> 41:20.901
in like a romantic
"if you love something,

41:20.978 --> 41:23.174
set it free" kind
of Sting kind of way.

41:23.247 --> 41:24.681
I mean I'm not
letting you escape.

41:24.748 --> 41:27.183
And I mean you don't have
a choice.

41:27.251 --> 41:30.312
My Blackhearts have already infiltrated
your compound.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.583
They are in position
as we speak.

41:32.656 --> 41:35.251
If I fail to contact them with the abort
code by midnight,

41:35.326 --> 41:38.296
all of your friends will die.

41:38.362 --> 41:39.455
Oh, bitch!

41:39.530 --> 41:41.192
What did those people
ever do to you, huh?!

41:41.265 --> 41:42.699
Call 'em off!
- Or what?

41:42.766 --> 41:47.329
You kill me, they all die.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.270
How about I <i>make</i> you
call on that code

41:49.340 --> 41:52.003
while I drop your new boyfriend
off a cliff?

41:52.076 --> 41:54.944
I'd rather die.

What?
This is a ghost costume.

44:00.004 --> 44:01.802
You said Goths
are into spooky stuff.

44:01.872 --> 44:03.101
This is spooky.

44:03.173 --> 44:04.163
Ugh!

44:04.241 --> 44:05.174
All right, it's gonna
have to do.

44:05.242 --> 44:06.835
Okay, I'm gonna light this up,

44:06.910 --> 44:08.344
and you go claim your woman.

44:08.412 --> 44:10.847
Here we go.

44:10.914 --> 44:12.348
Triana,
I have come for you!

44:14.518 --> 44:16.578
Oh, crap!
The fire's going out!

44:16.654 --> 44:17.986
How much gas
did you put on it?

44:18.055 --> 44:19.045
Dude, it's a mini bike.

44:19.123 --> 44:20.955
I ran out of gas,
like, after the first letter.

44:21.025 --> 44:22.960
Oh. This isn't good.

44:23.027 --> 44:24.620
Dude, we got to bail.

44:24.695 --> 44:26.027
D-Dude, book!

44:26.096 --> 44:29.692
Triana!

44:29.767 --> 44:31.668
Triana?

44:31.735 --> 44:34.136
Racist bastards!
Get off my lawn!

44:34.204 --> 44:35.832
- Aaah!
- Dean?

44:35.906 --> 44:37.033
Dean, what
are you doing, lad?

44:37.107 --> 44:39.042
Evening,
Mr. Outrider, sir.

44:39.109 --> 44:40.407
I was, uh...

44:40.477 --> 44:42.036
I-Is, um, Triana home?

44:42.112 --> 44:42.977
Well, no, son.

44:43.047 --> 44:45.107
She was very upset
after the prom,

44:45.182 --> 44:47.151
and I believe she went over
to Raven's house.

44:47.217 --> 44:49.880
Mommy, isn't that where
she said she was going?

44:49.953 --> 44:52.252
Dean I think I know
what this is all about.

44:52.322 --> 44:54.848
You know, a wise man

44:54.925 --> 44:56.655
who was either
Gur Jeff or Baba Oje

44:56.727 --> 44:58.559
once told me,
"you can never step

44:58.629 --> 45:00.564
into the same river twice."

45:00.631 --> 45:02.156
That makes no sense, sir.

45:02.232 --> 45:03.791
Triana really likes
that boy,

45:03.867 --> 45:05.392
and they're very happy
together.

45:05.469 --> 45:07.131
And if you truly love her,

45:07.204 --> 45:08.968
you should just move on

45:09.039 --> 45:11.770
and be happy
that she's happy.

45:11.842 --> 45:13.504
Don't you think?

45:14.912 --> 45:16.505
You know what I think?

45:16.580 --> 45:18.549
Fuck you!
