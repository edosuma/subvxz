00:00.320 --> 00:03.462
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.463 --> 00:05.122
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:05.123 --> 00:08.192
Are y'all at that age where you
just stare out the window now?

00:08.193 --> 00:10.795
We trying to get our first
look at the new neighbors.

00:10.796 --> 00:12.396
This is what you used to do, Jerrod,

00:12.397 --> 00:15.766
before you got that Internet.

00:15.767 --> 00:17.688
Yeah, we saw that moving
truck across the street.

00:17.689 --> 00:19.156
You guys have any idea who they are?

00:19.157 --> 00:20.838
Anybody would be better than Ilene.

00:20.839 --> 00:23.474
That woman lived across
the street 25 years,

00:23.475 --> 00:25.443
and I didn't even know her last name.

00:25.444 --> 00:28.345
She was a terrible person,
just terrible.

00:28.346 --> 00:30.847
God rest her soul.

00:31.982 --> 00:32.950
I loved Ilene.

00:32.951 --> 00:34.452
She was mean, but self-sufficient.

00:34.453 --> 00:35.920
She never asked me for nothing.

00:35.921 --> 00:38.289
I remember one time she
fell in the walkway,

00:38.290 --> 00:39.924
and I asked her did she need help,

00:39.925 --> 00:41.225
she flipped me the bird,

00:41.226 --> 00:44.462
then she army-crawled all
the way to the front door.

00:44.463 --> 00:46.063
Now that's what I call a good neighbor.

00:46.064 --> 00:47.531
Mm-hmm.

00:47.532 --> 00:49.795
You know, growing up, I spent
more time at the neighbor's

00:49.796 --> 00:50.734
than my own house.

00:50.735 --> 00:52.036
My parents were always fighting.

00:52.037 --> 00:54.138
It was too loud to even do my homework.

00:54.139 --> 00:56.640
Even to go home some nights. (chuckles)

00:56.641 --> 00:59.143
Jerrod hated homework, too.

00:59.144 --> 01:02.413
Ma, I think you completely
missed the point of that story.

01:02.414 --> 01:04.348
Ah! They're coming out!

01:04.349 --> 01:05.683
Whoa. Hey, Maxine, come.

01:05.684 --> 01:07.547
Let's stare out the window
with the old people.

01:07.548 --> 01:10.221
Let's watch as life
literally passes us by.

01:10.222 --> 01:12.823
I hope they're not
like Maxine's parents,

01:12.824 --> 01:14.825
loud and fighting all the time.

01:14.826 --> 01:17.428
Oh, so she did hear
that part of the story.

01:17.429 --> 01:18.762
JOE: Okay, it's a couple.

01:18.763 --> 01:21.864
A man and a woman... you got
to be clear these days.

01:25.069 --> 01:27.037
A young Muslim couple.

01:27.038 --> 01:29.139
Muslim, yes, Muslim.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.274
They're Muslims.

01:30.275 --> 01:32.243
Uh-huh, with the head
thing and everything.

01:32.244 --> 01:35.145
Mm-hmm, of all the things
they could be, they...

01:35.146 --> 01:37.481
(chuckles): they're Muslims.

01:37.482 --> 01:38.763
This should be very interesting.

01:38.764 --> 01:39.730
Yeah, very interesting.

01:39.731 --> 01:42.152
Okay, look, I, uh...

01:42.153 --> 01:45.523
I love how politically correct
we're pretending to be.

01:45.524 --> 01:47.187
We're in a safe place;
no one's listening.

01:47.188 --> 01:48.726
We can express how we really feel.

01:48.727 --> 01:51.427
Maxine is listening.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.465
Well, the truth is, you
know, we saw Muslims,

01:54.466 --> 01:55.966
and we don't know how to react

01:55.967 --> 01:57.401
'cause we don't see Muslims a lot.

01:57.402 --> 01:58.602
You know, only on TV,

01:58.603 --> 02:00.186
and they're usually
playing the bad guy,

02:00.187 --> 02:03.240
but no one has to feel bad for
expressing how they really feel.

02:03.241 --> 02:04.575
You know, Jerrod is right.

02:04.576 --> 02:05.910
This is an opportunity

02:05.911 --> 02:08.245
for us to have an open,
honest conversation.

02:08.246 --> 02:09.913
Mm-hmm.

02:09.914 --> 02:12.014
What are they doing in my America?!

that your new neighbors are Muslim,

03:01.932 --> 03:04.293
'cause that would imply that
you think that they could be...

03:04.294 --> 03:05.728
I don't even want to say the word.

03:05.729 --> 03:08.404
- Terrorist. - Terrorist.
- Terrorist, yeah. yeah.

03:08.405 --> 03:11.404
I don't think they're terrorists.

03:11.405 --> 03:13.006
I don't know what they are.

03:13.007 --> 03:16.909
I see them as two abandoned
bags at the airport.

03:17.251 --> 03:18.518
Nobody should panic,

03:18.519 --> 03:21.558
but nobody should take
their eyes off them either.

03:22.401 --> 03:24.026
Wouldn't life be easier

03:24.027 --> 03:26.462
if there was just one kind of religion?

03:26.463 --> 03:28.464
Are you suggesting,
like, a master race, Ma?

03:28.465 --> 03:30.699
No, just, like, one group of folk

03:30.700 --> 03:33.602
who, like... dominate?

03:33.603 --> 03:35.137
Well, you know what I'm saying.

03:35.138 --> 03:37.640
Okay, so maybe we should
all become Muslims, then.

03:37.641 --> 03:40.743
Well, that is clearly
not what I'm saying.

03:40.744 --> 03:43.779
I can't believe how
Islamophobic you're being.

03:43.780 --> 03:46.081
But, Maxine, not all phobias are bad.

03:46.082 --> 03:47.816
My fear of sharks is what kept me

03:47.817 --> 03:49.560
from being eaten by a
shark all these years.

03:49.561 --> 03:51.987
Well, that and the fact that
I don't know how to swim.

03:51.988 --> 03:55.758
But that also proves that
some stereotypes are true.

03:55.759 --> 03:57.059
Yeah, that's true.

03:57.060 --> 04:00.228
For example, I don't tip.

04:00.896 --> 04:01.997
See?

04:01.998 --> 04:04.500
Okay, but your neighbors aren't sharks,

04:04.501 --> 04:07.069
they're people, and I am sure
that they are perfectly lovely.

04:07.070 --> 04:10.372
You know, Maxine, you are
right 99% of the time,

04:10.373 --> 04:11.774
but proud Americans like myself,

04:11.775 --> 04:13.375
I'm here to protect the rest of us

04:13.376 --> 04:15.399
from the one percent that
falls through the cracks.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.512
CYNTHIA: Yeah.

04:16.512 --> 04:18.781
Joe, you know, I think
we need to go over there,

04:18.781 --> 04:21.483
introduce ourselves, and
just lay on the charm.

04:21.483 --> 04:22.785
That's a good idea, Cynthia.

04:22.786 --> 04:25.419
Keep your friends close
and your Muslims closer.

04:27.222 --> 04:28.724
Joe.

04:28.725 --> 04:30.068
I mean, Maxine, you can disagree,

04:30.069 --> 04:33.562
but that slogan alone
could win him an election.

04:33.563 --> 04:35.164
You know what?

04:35.165 --> 04:37.466
I'm gonna make them a gift basket,

04:37.467 --> 04:39.702
go over there, welcome
them to the neighborhood.

04:39.703 --> 04:42.905
I think it wouldn't hurt
to be on their good side.

04:42.906 --> 04:45.174
So your gift basket has
an ulterior motive?

04:45.175 --> 04:47.810
So?

04:47.811 --> 04:50.979
You know why Jesus was
so nice to everyone?

04:50.980 --> 04:53.649
Because he knew people
were trying to kill him.

04:53.650 --> 04:55.082
JOE: Mm-hmm.

04:56.118 --> 04:57.886
And all of that still
didn't help Jesus.

04:57.887 --> 04:59.855
Makes you wonder,
maybe he could've been nicer.

04:59.856 --> 05:02.624
Jerrod, remember when
you were in middle school,

05:02.625 --> 05:05.194
I told you and your brother

05:05.195 --> 05:08.197
to always be nice to the
white kids in trench coats.

05:08.198 --> 05:09.732
Kept you safe, didn't it?

05:09.733 --> 05:11.166
'Cause they didn't do anything.

05:11.167 --> 05:13.936
That's because you were nice to them.

05:13.937 --> 05:15.537
You guys, we can't assume the worst.

05:15.538 --> 05:17.573
You know, profiling has consequences.

05:17.574 --> 05:19.077
If you treat someone like a criminal,

05:19.078 --> 05:21.343
they are more likely to become one.

05:21.344 --> 05:23.612
You know, the only time
I ever thought about stealing

05:23.613 --> 05:26.381
was when I was followed around
a store by a security guard.

05:26.382 --> 05:28.684
Uh...

05:28.685 --> 05:31.253
What? I've been followed before.

05:31.254 --> 05:34.355
Don't think that's so unbelievable.

05:36.425 --> 05:38.960
What? I dressed differently back then.

05:41.830 --> 05:43.599
Okay, fine. I was with Nekeisha.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.901
Ha! Okay. That makes sense.

05:45.902 --> 05:48.551
- That makes complete sense.
- CYNTHIA: I was gonna say,

05:48.552 --> 05:50.372
things are really bad

05:50.373 --> 05:52.307
if somebody's following around Maxine.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.474
(laughing)

05:55.310 --> 05:57.579
The point is, it was really hurtful.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.581
And, you know, I don't
want to live in a society

05:59.582 --> 06:00.949
where just any crazy person

06:00.950 --> 06:02.918
can accuse their neighbor of anything.

06:02.919 --> 06:05.223
Well, the police couldn't stop
that San Bernardino attack.

06:05.224 --> 06:06.655
But you know who could?

06:06.656 --> 06:09.458
A neighbor who noticed that
couple acting strangely

06:09.459 --> 06:11.560
and receiving too many packages.

06:11.561 --> 06:12.962
But he didn't want to say anything,

06:12.963 --> 06:14.997
'cause he didn't want people
to think he was crazy.

06:14.998 --> 06:15.898
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:15.899 --> 06:16.865
What up?

06:16.866 --> 06:18.049
Hey, I met the new neighbors.

06:18.050 --> 06:19.001
They're really nice.

06:19.002 --> 06:20.536
Way nicer than old Ilene.

06:20.537 --> 06:22.171
Yeah, that lady was a bitch.

06:22.172 --> 06:24.673
God rest her soul.

06:24.674 --> 06:26.697
Well, maybe they're nice,
maybe they're pretending.

06:26.698 --> 06:28.844
All I know is I got to go put together

06:28.845 --> 06:30.579
that "welcome to the neighborhood,

06:30.580 --> 06:32.747
please don't blow us up" basket.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.518
What is she talking about?

06:36.519 --> 06:39.054
Mom and Dad think the new
neighbors might be terrorists.

06:39.055 --> 06:40.255
I didn't say that.

06:40.256 --> 06:42.191
I said I wasn't sure
they aren't terrorists.

06:42.192 --> 06:44.560
Wait, wait, why?
Because they're Muslim?

06:44.561 --> 06:47.062
Muslims are not terrorists.
Crazy people are terrorists.

06:47.063 --> 06:49.798
Look, Dad, if Muhammad Ali
and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar moved

06:49.799 --> 06:52.022
across the street, would you
think they were terrorists?

06:52.023 --> 06:55.470
No, but we'd think they were broke.

06:55.471 --> 06:57.573
Bobby, that's different.
They're black Muslims.

06:57.574 --> 07:00.075
We're talking about
regular Muslims here.

07:00.076 --> 07:01.899
Regular Muslims need,
like, somebody to, like,

07:01.900 --> 07:03.212
be a gateway Muslim for them.

07:03.213 --> 07:04.813
If a regular Muslim won <i>The Voice,</i>

07:04.814 --> 07:07.549
it could change everything for them.

07:07.550 --> 07:08.951
So what'd you find out, Nekeisha?

07:08.952 --> 07:10.252
Did you get any Intel on them?

07:10.253 --> 07:11.854
- Joe, you know your girl got you.
- Oh!

07:11.855 --> 07:14.556
Now, they said they're
from New York originally,

07:14.557 --> 07:16.992
but they have spent
some time in Pakistan

07:16.993 --> 07:19.228
for, like, a couple of
years living with family.

07:19.229 --> 07:22.430
I knew it. Pakistan.
It's always Pakistan.

07:23.632 --> 07:26.535
Pakistan is one of them
countries that hates America.

07:26.536 --> 07:28.840
Oh, I wonder if it has anything
to do with us bombing them

07:28.841 --> 07:29.838
for the last ten years.

07:29.839 --> 07:31.206
Now, I'm not gonna stand here

07:31.207 --> 07:33.208
and play chicken or
egg with you, Maxine.

07:33.209 --> 07:34.610
NEKEISHA: I'm not jumping

07:34.611 --> 07:36.211
to conclusions and I'm not saying

07:36.212 --> 07:38.747
that your new neighbors might
be members of ISIS, but...

07:38.748 --> 07:40.849
ISIL. What's the difference?

07:40.850 --> 07:42.718
I don't know.

07:42.719 --> 07:45.120
Point is, we offered to
help them with some boxes,

07:45.121 --> 07:48.023
and they were quick to tell us
no and get rid of me and Bobby.

07:48.024 --> 07:50.158
That's 'cause you was asking 'em
too many personal questions.

07:50.159 --> 07:52.461
What do we care if they're
renting or buying anyway?

07:52.462 --> 07:54.496
'Cause everybody knows
that terrorists are renters.

07:54.497 --> 07:57.399
Why would you buy if you
know you about to go jihad

07:57.400 --> 07:59.433
and miss out on your tax benefits?

08:00.025 --> 08:01.699
That's a good point, Nekeisha.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.683
I think you done blown this
whole thing wide open.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.039
Mm.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.303
Now, look, you got a hookup
on some night vision goggles?

08:06.304 --> 08:06.508
I do.

08:06.509 --> 08:08.412
Okay, I feel like I'm
watching the worst episode

08:08.413 --> 08:09.678
of <i>Homeland</i> ever.

08:09.679 --> 08:11.079
CYNTHIA: All right, Joe.

08:11.080 --> 08:15.651
I got everything that makes
America great in this basket.

08:15.652 --> 08:19.388
I got some Pringles, Coke Zero,

08:19.389 --> 08:21.957
some Susan B. Anthony coins,

08:21.958 --> 08:23.926
and a <i>Evan Almighty</i> DVD.

08:23.927 --> 08:28.230
You know, this is basically
America in a basket.

08:28.231 --> 08:30.766
Cynthia, they are American.
They are from New York.

08:30.767 --> 08:34.102
Oh, should I put a Snapple in here?

08:34.102 --> 08:36.166
Jerrod, are you really gonna
let them go over there?

08:36.167 --> 08:36.938
This is crazy.

08:36.940 --> 08:38.874
No, what's crazy is my mom has

08:38.875 --> 08:41.842
what is clearly a bootleg
<i>Evan Almighty</i> DVD,

08:41.844 --> 08:44.212
and she's gonna give
it to a Muslim family

08:44.212 --> 08:46.114
in an Easter basket.

08:46.115 --> 08:48.917
Jerrod, this is a
perfectly nice basket.

08:48.918 --> 08:51.186
Everybody loves Easter.

08:51.187 --> 08:54.188
It's the best comeback
story there ever was.

08:55.390 --> 08:57.225
You go on and get them there, Cynthia.

08:57.226 --> 08:58.961
You gonna win them
over with your smile,

08:58.962 --> 09:01.229
while I look around and see if I see

09:01.230 --> 09:03.098
any evidence of radicalization.

09:03.099 --> 09:04.566
BOBBY: You know something,

09:04.567 --> 09:06.835
man, y'all are being
real prejudiced right now.

09:06.836 --> 09:09.671
You're being close-minded
and you're being ignorant.

09:09.672 --> 09:11.906
Bobby, you seem grumpy.
You hungry? Huh.

09:12.874 --> 09:14.643
Eat some of these Pringles.

09:14.644 --> 09:16.979
Joe, what are you gonna
do, go snoop around

09:16.980 --> 09:19.047
this unsuspecting couple's home?

09:19.048 --> 09:19.748
Yes.

09:19.749 --> 09:21.450
Oh, that is a beautiful way

09:21.451 --> 09:23.018
to welcome them to the neighborhood.

09:23.019 --> 09:24.619
Are you really gonna let them do this?

09:24.620 --> 09:26.688
I mean, what do you
want me to do, Maxine?

09:26.689 --> 09:28.223
Obama said we got to stay vigilant.

09:28.224 --> 09:29.807
He said if you see
something suspicious,

09:29.808 --> 09:31.059
you should say something.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.763
Yeah, and in that same
speech, he also said

09:32.764 --> 09:35.130
that we have to reject
bigotry in all its forms

09:35.131 --> 09:36.565
and that discrimination undermines

09:36.566 --> 09:38.166
our national security.

09:38.167 --> 09:41.569
And Michelle said we need
to get up and move more.

09:46.675 --> 09:48.276
Hello!

09:48.277 --> 09:50.145
We're your new neighbors, and we'd like

09:50.146 --> 09:52.047
to welcome you to our community.

09:52.048 --> 09:54.249
I'm Joe Carmichael.
This is my wife Cynthia.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.284
- I'm Zayn.
- And I'm Fahmida.

09:56.285 --> 09:57.986
Very nice to meet you.

09:57.987 --> 09:59.421
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:59.422 --> 10:00.722
We try to follow Islamic law

10:00.723 --> 10:02.657
and limit nonessential physical contact

10:02.658 --> 10:04.059
with the opposite gender.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.293
No offense.

10:05.294 --> 10:07.729
Oh.

10:07.730 --> 10:09.297
Well, great!

10:09.298 --> 10:11.833
I love learning new customs.

10:11.834 --> 10:15.035
So y'all lived in Pakistan, huh?

10:16.838 --> 10:18.440
Yes.

10:18.441 --> 10:19.741
So which you like better?

10:19.742 --> 10:21.143
You mean, like, as a country?

10:21.144 --> 10:23.145
Mm-hmm.

10:23.146 --> 10:24.880
Do we have to choose?

10:24.881 --> 10:26.214
(chuckles): Oh.

10:26.215 --> 10:27.482
He's just messing around.

10:27.483 --> 10:28.849
(chuckles)

10:29.684 --> 10:32.821
But, seriously, if you had to pick one.

10:32.822 --> 10:34.423
Well, we love it here,

10:34.424 --> 10:37.259
but a lot of our family and
friends still live in Pakistan,

10:37.260 --> 10:38.293
so...

10:38.294 --> 10:39.661
I hear Pakistan is beautiful.

10:39.662 --> 10:41.029
I hear the people are beautiful.

10:41.030 --> 10:42.397
She's beautiful.

10:42.398 --> 10:44.699
At least, what I can see of her.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.701
(Cynthia laughs)

10:46.702 --> 10:48.502
(sighs) Oh.

10:49.404 --> 10:52.340
I-I brought you all a gift basket.

10:52.341 --> 10:54.376
Okay, thank you.

10:54.377 --> 10:55.677
We'll see you around.

10:55.678 --> 10:57.512
Okay.

10:57.513 --> 10:59.948
We love you!

10:59.949 --> 11:01.483
"We love you"?

11:01.484 --> 11:04.618
Well, I was just trying
to make conversation.

11:06.688 --> 11:08.590
You need somebody to sign for that?

11:08.591 --> 11:10.824
Nah.

11:21.336 --> 11:23.138
It's from Pakistan.

11:23.139 --> 11:25.140
Ooh, Pakistan!

11:25.141 --> 11:26.674
Yeah.

11:32.166 --> 11:35.206
Oh, come on, are-are you really
mad at me right now, Maxine?

11:35.207 --> 11:37.308
Yes. The only reason that
your parents are suspicious

11:37.309 --> 11:39.092
of their neighbors is
because they're Muslim.

11:39.093 --> 11:40.177
And how is that my fault?

11:40.178 --> 11:41.712
It's not your fault,
but I would like you

11:41.713 --> 11:43.776
to at least agree with me
that they're acting crazy.

11:43.777 --> 11:45.349
Well, I'm sorry. I can't agree to that.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.051
Well, that's why it's your fault.

11:47.052 --> 11:48.819
Well, look.

11:48.820 --> 11:51.855
Maxine, I agree that maybe
they're overreacting.

11:51.856 --> 11:53.457
But I won't say that I don't understand

11:53.458 --> 11:54.825
where their fear comes from.

11:54.826 --> 11:57.728
Look, I understand that racially
profiling someone is wrong

11:57.729 --> 11:59.730
and we need to respect
people's civil liberties.

11:59.731 --> 12:00.965
But...

12:00.966 --> 12:03.167
turning a blind eye and
pretending that their neighbors

12:03.168 --> 12:05.431
aren't capable of something
bad isn't the answer, either.

12:05.432 --> 12:06.870
So what is the answer?

12:06.871 --> 12:09.372
You're asking me to solve
terrorism right now?

12:11.742 --> 12:13.711
I mean, I really think
I can fix our problems

12:13.712 --> 12:15.646
with the Middle East,
but I'm gonna need

12:15.647 --> 12:18.449
at least a Red Bull first.

12:18.450 --> 12:20.351
Look, your parents
are being xenophobic.

12:20.352 --> 12:23.487
And you have to realize the
negative consequences of that.

12:23.488 --> 12:24.889
If your parents said that we should

12:24.890 --> 12:26.433
build a wall around the whole country,

12:26.434 --> 12:28.025
would you agree with them on that, too?

12:28.026 --> 12:30.594
Of course I want a wall!

12:30.595 --> 12:31.776
I mean, look, Maxine,

12:31.777 --> 12:33.921
I'm not anti-immigration,
but I'm definitely pro-wall.

12:33.922 --> 12:35.032
I mean, walls are amazing.

12:35.033 --> 12:36.233
If walls aren't so great,

12:36.234 --> 12:38.969
why are we standing in walls right now?

12:38.970 --> 12:40.738
I mean, we wouldn't
knock down a whole wall

12:40.739 --> 12:42.706
just so one of our neighbors
could wander in here

12:42.707 --> 12:44.090
if they're ever feeling oppressed.

12:44.091 --> 12:45.154
I'm sorry, is Donald Trump

12:45.155 --> 12:48.145
behind the couch feeding you lines?

12:48.146 --> 12:50.614
I am completely cool with anybody

12:50.615 --> 12:51.982
coming to this country.

12:51.983 --> 12:54.852
I would just like for them
to have been invited first.

12:54.853 --> 12:56.694
Jerrod, the only reason
that any of us are here

12:56.695 --> 12:57.758
is because of immigration.

12:57.759 --> 12:59.886
No, I'm here because of slavery.

13:01.592 --> 13:04.528
You know, you got to understand,
I was invited.

13:04.529 --> 13:06.797
I mean, it... it was
an aggressive invitation,

13:06.798 --> 13:09.832
but an invitation, nonetheless.

13:11.468 --> 13:13.604
Hey, Jerrod, it's me, Bobby.

13:13.605 --> 13:15.205
What do you want?

13:15.206 --> 13:16.807
Look, we got an issue.

13:16.808 --> 13:19.576
Dad stole a package from
those nice Muslim neighbors.

13:19.577 --> 13:20.744
God...

13:20.745 --> 13:21.812
He stole a package?

13:21.813 --> 13:23.380
See? There are consequences.

13:23.381 --> 13:25.182
This is what fear does to people.

13:25.183 --> 13:27.418
You know, opening someone's
mail is a federal offense.

13:27.419 --> 13:29.887
Well, he hasn't opened it yet.

13:29.888 --> 13:32.823
He's just sitting there staring at it.

13:32.824 --> 13:34.924
Just like "The Tell-Tale Heart."

13:36.794 --> 13:38.761
Yeah, Bobby reads, too.

13:40.597 --> 13:42.366
Why would they do something so dumb?

13:42.367 --> 13:44.301
I mean, I was this close to laying out

13:44.302 --> 13:45.869
this nuanced argument about

13:45.870 --> 13:47.538
foreign policy,
and now I got to go save

13:47.539 --> 13:49.939
Kanye and Kim from
embarrassing our family.

13:51.842 --> 13:54.311
Joe, are we really gonna do this?

13:54.312 --> 13:55.846
Well, I think we have to, Cynthia.

13:55.847 --> 13:59.083
We don't want to be neighbors
who turned a blind eye.

13:59.084 --> 14:00.467
We've been through a lot of things

14:00.468 --> 14:03.320
in our 30-plus years together, but...

14:03.321 --> 14:06.023
we've never committed a felony, babe.

14:06.024 --> 14:07.624
Mmm.

14:07.625 --> 14:11.128
Only you could take a moment
like this and turn it romantic.

14:11.129 --> 14:13.930
- (giggling)
- I love you! Mm!

14:15.733 --> 14:19.169
Are you guys really making
out over a stolen package?

14:19.170 --> 14:21.438
Not stolen. Intercepted.

14:21.439 --> 14:23.140
And for good reason, son.

14:23.141 --> 14:26.577
This package came
from Pakistan. Pakistan!

14:26.578 --> 14:29.680
What do they need a box
so bad from Pakistan for?

14:29.681 --> 14:32.349
I don't know. Maybe 'cause
their family is from Pakistan.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.813
We don't know what's in there.
Maybe it's something dangerous.

14:34.814 --> 14:37.154
We could be saving lives.
We could be heroes.

14:37.155 --> 14:39.189
This might get me a Wikipedia page.

14:39.190 --> 14:40.624
Yes!

14:40.625 --> 14:42.559
I might get

14:42.560 --> 14:44.361
a picture with Joe Biden.

14:44.362 --> 14:45.329
I mean, he needs

14:45.330 --> 14:46.730
a fun friend like me.

14:46.731 --> 14:48.565
He's always so sad.

14:48.566 --> 14:52.536
You know, he's been through
a Kennedy amount of pain.

14:52.537 --> 14:54.960
You guys really think you're
gonna be heroes because of this?

14:54.961 --> 14:55.973
No, look,

14:55.974 --> 14:57.875
I agree, if you see something,
say something.

14:57.876 --> 14:59.510
But you're not supposed
to do something.

14:59.511 --> 15:01.211
And you didn't even see something.

15:01.212 --> 15:04.715
You saw nothing,
then you stole something.

15:04.716 --> 15:06.617
Why are you yelling at us?

15:06.618 --> 15:08.252
Because you took it too far!

15:08.253 --> 15:10.236
You're supposed to at least
respect their privacy.

15:10.237 --> 15:12.322
Oh, nobody cares about privacy.

15:12.323 --> 15:14.725
Security is more important.
And you know something else?

15:14.726 --> 15:17.361
The NSA <i>should be spying on all of us,</i>

15:17.362 --> 15:18.929
but they've been slowed down

15:18.930 --> 15:20.697
from people like you and that Snowden,

15:20.698 --> 15:23.934
thinking your secrets are so important.

15:23.935 --> 15:26.336
Well, I got news for you:
the government doesn't

15:26.337 --> 15:29.606
give two damns about you and
your funky little text messages.

15:29.607 --> 15:31.870
Okay, really? Really, Dad?
You really want the government

15:31.871 --> 15:33.644
listening in on all
of your phone calls?

15:33.645 --> 15:35.879
I got nothing to hide!

15:35.880 --> 15:37.981
Now, if the government wants to listen

15:37.982 --> 15:39.983
to me and my friend
Bernard talking about

15:39.984 --> 15:42.352
how we think Emmitt Smith
is the greatest running back

15:42.353 --> 15:45.756
in the history of all mankind,
let them come on with it.

15:45.757 --> 15:47.090
They might learn something,

15:47.091 --> 15:49.166
'cause I got fascinating opinions.

15:49.167 --> 15:51.662
All right. Enough talking, I'm going in!

15:51.663 --> 15:53.096
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't...

15:53.097 --> 15:54.665
Don't-don't hit their detonator, honey.

15:54.666 --> 15:56.200
There-there's not a bomb in that box.

15:56.201 --> 15:58.068
You don't know what's in there.

15:58.069 --> 16:00.537
It's a teddy bear.

16:00.538 --> 16:02.673
It's an adorable, delightful,

16:02.674 --> 16:04.241
brown teddy bear.

16:04.242 --> 16:05.609
Well, I don't get it.

16:05.610 --> 16:09.446
Should I cut it open to see
where the bomb is inside of it?

16:09.447 --> 16:10.681
Thank you for saving America.

16:10.682 --> 16:12.483
How does it feel to be SEAL Team Six?

16:12.484 --> 16:13.916
(knocking on door)

16:15.219 --> 16:17.687
Oh, it's the Muslims.
Quick, hide the bear!

16:20.491 --> 16:22.526
- (chuckles): Hello, you two.
- Oh!

16:22.527 --> 16:24.294
What a pleasant surprise.

16:24.295 --> 16:27.030
Our favorite new neighbors.

16:27.031 --> 16:28.574
We're missing a package from my family

16:28.575 --> 16:29.967
that was supposed to arrive today.

16:29.968 --> 16:31.401
Wondering if you guys saw anything.

16:31.402 --> 16:33.070
No, but thanks for stopping by.

16:33.071 --> 16:34.638
Really?

16:34.639 --> 16:37.341
Because supposedly it arrived
after you guys left our place.

16:37.342 --> 16:38.842
You really didn't see anything?

16:38.843 --> 16:41.445
Uh, no... we ain't saw...

16:41.446 --> 16:43.547
Uh, honey, did you see a package?

16:43.548 --> 16:44.548
No.

16:44.549 --> 16:45.849
Okay, look, I'm sure

16:45.850 --> 16:48.252
this is the package that
you guys are looking for.

16:48.253 --> 16:49.953
Jerrod!

16:49.954 --> 16:52.289
Did you take that from those people?

16:52.290 --> 16:54.925
Yeah, Jerrod, that's a federal offense.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.093
Really? Really?

16:56.094 --> 16:58.095
Um, sorry, I should have
introduced myself sooner.

16:58.096 --> 17:00.464
I am their very embarrassed son Jerrod.

17:00.465 --> 17:01.832
I knew they stole it.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.667
Now, hold on, don't
jump to conclusions.

17:03.668 --> 17:05.402
We don't know they stole it, Zayn.

17:05.403 --> 17:07.304
Oh, yeah, they stole it.

17:07.305 --> 17:08.872
Why would you do that?

17:08.873 --> 17:11.541
Why does anybody do anything, really?

17:11.542 --> 17:12.976
ZAYN: Fahmida, I told you

17:12.977 --> 17:15.000
things like this would
happen in this neighborhood.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.380
Well, this neighborhood?

17:16.381 --> 17:18.549
If this neighborhood is
so bad, why'd you move in?

17:18.550 --> 17:19.983
It's all we could afford.

17:19.983 --> 17:22.853
Yeah, us, too.

17:22.854 --> 17:24.186
Look, let us explain.

17:24.188 --> 17:26.123
You saw a Muslim couple
move in next door

17:26.124 --> 17:27.558
and it terrified you?

17:27.559 --> 17:29.860
That's a pretty good guess.

17:29.861 --> 17:34.063
You know, you would do
very well on <i>Family Feud.</i>

17:35.866 --> 17:38.468
The words my family seems
to have trouble finding are

17:38.469 --> 17:41.605
"I'm sorry" or
"Please don't press charges."

17:41.606 --> 17:43.109
Jerrod, don't put words in our mouth.

17:43.110 --> 17:45.275
But please don't press charges.

17:45.276 --> 17:48.211
I mean, what did you think
you were gonna find in here?

17:48.212 --> 17:49.279
JOE: You know, instead of

17:49.280 --> 17:52.015
focusing on why did
we cut the box open,

17:52.016 --> 17:54.585
let's focus on the fact that
we didn't cut that bear open.

17:54.586 --> 17:55.652
And we could have.

17:55.653 --> 17:57.154
- We thought about it.
- Mm-hmm.

17:57.155 --> 17:58.618
But we didn't. You want to know why?

17:58.619 --> 17:59.756
'Cause we trust you.

17:59.757 --> 18:02.059
'Cause we're neighbors.

18:02.060 --> 18:05.228
This was a gift from our
family to congratulate us.

18:05.229 --> 18:06.897
We're expecting our first child.

18:06.898 --> 18:08.565
Oh, that's great!

18:08.566 --> 18:10.167
You're having a baby.

18:10.168 --> 18:11.702
Now, who do I hug?

18:11.703 --> 18:14.437
I can't hug you, but I can
hug you. Did I get it right?

18:15.739 --> 18:17.941
This isn't the first time
this has happened to us.

18:17.942 --> 18:19.485
You assume every Muslim's a terrorist,

18:19.486 --> 18:21.044
and it's rooted in absolutely nothing.

18:21.045 --> 18:23.046
Do I look like a terrorist to you?

18:23.047 --> 18:25.215
Well, if I was casting
a new season of <i>24,</i>

18:25.216 --> 18:27.783
you would get the part.

18:29.519 --> 18:32.155
Every single day,
I get judgmental looks,

18:32.156 --> 18:34.257
and it makes me so angry.

18:34.258 --> 18:35.626
But I can't get angry.

18:35.627 --> 18:38.295
Because there is nothing
scarier to America

18:38.296 --> 18:41.264
than an angry young Muslim
woman wearing a hijab,

18:41.265 --> 18:43.800
and that really pisses me off!

18:43.801 --> 18:45.944
I think America's still more
afraid of me in a hoodie,

18:45.945 --> 18:47.738
but I do feel where you're coming from.

18:47.739 --> 18:50.173
How would you like it
if I assumed you were

18:50.174 --> 18:52.409
loudmouth criminals just
because you were black?

18:52.410 --> 18:54.510
Well, today you would
have assumed correctly.

18:56.213 --> 18:58.415
Fahmida, let's go.

18:58.416 --> 19:01.151
Well, nice of you to drop by.

19:01.152 --> 19:04.855
And if you need a babysitter,
just feel free to call.

19:04.856 --> 19:06.390
You know, it's behavior like this

19:06.391 --> 19:07.924
that gives you people a bad name.

19:07.925 --> 19:09.960
"You people"?

19:09.961 --> 19:12.763
You people can't call us "you people"!

19:12.764 --> 19:14.264
We love you!

19:14.265 --> 19:16.466
This is not the moment for that.

19:16.467 --> 19:18.235
Jerrod, what is wrong with you?

19:18.236 --> 19:19.469
Coming over here,

19:19.470 --> 19:22.572
causing all this conflict
with our neighbors.

19:22.573 --> 19:24.141
I could've re-taped that box

19:24.142 --> 19:26.376
and just snuck it on their porch.

19:26.377 --> 19:28.145
What's wrong with me?
Are you kidding me?

19:28.146 --> 19:29.846
I watched you guys commit a felony

19:29.847 --> 19:31.470
and then almost
destroy your relationship

19:31.471 --> 19:32.616
with those neighbors.

19:32.617 --> 19:34.651
Honestly, if you really think about it,

19:34.652 --> 19:37.187
in this situation, the real
terrorists are you people.

19:37.188 --> 19:39.022
"You people"?!

19:39.023 --> 19:40.323
Hey, Jerrod!

19:40.324 --> 19:42.459
Hey, Jerrod, what you
mean by "you people"?!

19:42.460 --> 19:45.628
If it wasn't for us people,
you wouldn't <i>be</i> people!

19:49.965 --> 19:53.407
I can't believe no one showed up for
our "meet your neighbors" party.

19:53.509 --> 19:55.243
I may as well be honest
with you, Maxine.

19:55.244 --> 19:57.412
You know all the flyers
you put up in the hallway?

19:57.413 --> 19:58.780
I took them down.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.115
What? Why would you do that?

20:01.116 --> 20:02.650
I thought we were gonna
get to know our neighbors,

20:02.651 --> 20:03.885
you know, expand our world.

20:03.886 --> 20:05.309
I don't want to meet our neighbors.

20:05.310 --> 20:06.554
You got to do small talk.

20:06.555 --> 20:10.258
I'd rather have small talk
about the weather with Siri.

20:10.259 --> 20:11.493
(knocking on door)

20:11.494 --> 20:13.660
Oh, God.

20:16.598 --> 20:18.466
- Hey.
- Hello, come on in.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.935
I don't think we've officially met.
I'm Maxine.

20:20.936 --> 20:22.437
I know. He's Jerrod.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.273
Okay, how do you know our names, Mr...?

20:25.274 --> 20:27.308
Jamar. And I can hear y'all.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.744
Oh, I'm sorry. Are we being too loud?

20:29.745 --> 20:31.646
Oh, no, I'm listening.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.480
I'm always listening.

20:34.649 --> 20:35.650
I'm here to warn you.

20:35.651 --> 20:36.851
You see them Sudanese dudes

20:36.852 --> 20:38.386
that just moved in next door?

20:38.387 --> 20:40.121
Real child soldier types.

20:40.122 --> 20:42.290
They roll their own cigarettes.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.291
Watch your backs.

20:49.097 --> 20:51.160
This is why I don't like
meeting new people, Maxine.

20:51.161 --> 20:53.421
