06:42.110 --> 06:44.810
Now, as you can see, The
same dialogue can evoke

06:44.840 --> 06:47.840
An infinite number of emotions,
Depending upon how the actor

06:47.880 --> 06:49.450
Chooses to play it.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.810
Like a robot.

06:50.850 --> 06:52.650
- what did you do to my pants?

06:52.680 --> 06:53.780
- wrong.

06:53.820 --> 06:55.050

06:57.750 --> 06:59.560
Tori, you may sit.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.010
- you said you were sorry
And everybody knows

07:23.050 --> 07:26.220

therefore, Cannot feel regret.

07:26.250 --> 07:31.320
You kids have got to do
Your robot research.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.520

In many different ways,
Depending upon--

07:39.700 --> 07:41.030

- any mentally stable person
Puts on a sock and a sock

And then a shoe and a shoe.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.490
- leave me alone.

14:53.530 --> 14:55.990
- robbie, I think it'd be
better If I could talk to you

14:56.030 --> 14:57.830
By yourself first.

14:57.860 --> 14:59.560
- what, without rex?

14:59.600 --> 15:04.770
- I don't care. I need a nap.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.770
- do you have room In
one of those drawers?

15:06.800 --> 15:12.170
- sure.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.660
- have a seat.

15:27.690 --> 15:29.860
- okay. I'm sitting now.

15:29.890 --> 15:32.200
- so, robbie, Tell me
about your nightmares.

15:32.230 --> 15:35.530
- well, last night I
dreamt that I was standing

15:35.570 --> 15:36.900
On a gigantic chair.

15:36.930 --> 15:37.800
- a big chair.

15:37.830 --> 15:38.570
- gigantic.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.440
- I understand.

15:40.470 --> 15:45.740
- and then rex, Who's like
20 feet tall, Sat on me.

15:45.780 --> 15:46.810
- he sat on you.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.680
- with his butt.

15:49.710 --> 15:51.980
- robbie, do you think
It would be fair to say

15:52.020 --> 15:55.620
That rex, you know, Insults you a lot?

15:55.650 --> 15:57.420
- oh yes.

- and ridicules you?

15:59.560 --> 16:00.160

16:00.190 --> 16:02.430
But why would that Make
me have nightmares?

16:02.460 --> 16:07.500
- because, see, in real life,
Rex bullies you with words.

16:07.530 --> 16:09.570
- sometimes he slaps me.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.630
- okay.

So, when you're asleep at
night, Your subconscious mind

16:13.940 --> 16:16.840
Amplifies all that abuse,
And that's what creates

16:16.870 --> 16:19.710
These terrifying images You
see in your nightmares.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.740
- fascinating.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.950
- I think you need Couples counseling.

16:24.980 --> 16:25.780
- rex and me?

16:25.820 --> 16:26.820
- mm-hmm.

16:26.850 --> 16:29.250
Why don't you get him out Of that
drawer And we can get started?

16:29.290 --> 16:32.750
- okay.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.190
- hey, don't you knock?
