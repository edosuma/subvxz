WEBVTT

01:21.624 --> 01:23.585
All hides and furs!

01:23.668 --> 01:27.255
All types of fur and hides!
From Hedeby!

01:35.180 --> 01:36.681
Hello, friends!

01:38.141 --> 01:41.853
The great King Ragnar,
back from the dead.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.938
What are you doing here?

01:45.523 --> 01:47.692
I'll let you in
on a secret.

01:48.443 --> 01:49.944
I'm going to
raid England again.

01:50.028 --> 01:54.032
And I'm looking for warriors,
like you and like you,
to join me.

01:54.324 --> 01:56.534
Why do you want to
raid England again?

01:57.160 --> 01:59.412
I've heard your son
Bjorn has other plans.

01:59.496 --> 02:03.166
Yes, he does,
but I have my own plans.

02:05.710 --> 02:09.172
To exact revenge
on the destruction
of the settlement.

02:10.632 --> 02:13.635
Yes. My brother
and his family went with you.

02:14.427 --> 02:16.888
They were farmers,
like me.

02:20.558 --> 02:23.436
We never did find out
what happened to them.

02:26.773 --> 02:30.318
But it seems
you knew all along

02:31.653 --> 02:33.571
and didn't tell us.

02:35.156 --> 02:39.244
And, now, you want us
to go and revenge,

02:40.453 --> 02:43.581
not for my brother,
and his wife,

02:44.082 --> 02:45.500
and their children,

02:45.583 --> 02:48.503
because you didn't
care for them, no.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.131
For your own guilt.

02:53.341 --> 02:57.262
And do you know what,
Ragnar Lothbrok?

02:58.638 --> 03:00.265
Do you know what?

03:24.289 --> 03:26.291
Thank you for your time.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.294
And if I had
the mind to raid,

03:30.336 --> 03:33.631
I would raid with your son,
and not with you!

03:34.924 --> 03:40.096
For I believe
the gods have deserted you,
King Ragnar Lothbrok!

03:41.472 --> 03:43.224
You are on your own!

03:43.975 --> 03:46.144
Everyone hates you now!

03:53.151 --> 03:56.946
You will have to
travel down here,
along the coast of Frankia.

03:58.323 --> 04:00.825
It will be hard
not to be detected.

04:01.618 --> 04:04.662
I am sure Floki's
new boats can out sail

04:04.787 --> 04:07.749
anything the Franks
put out to sea.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.334
We cannot be
at sea forever.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.669
Rollo has a new
kingdom on the coast.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.257
I don't see
any other way.

04:16.341 --> 04:18.092
Because there
isn't one.

04:25.558 --> 04:27.435
I could
talk to Rollo.

04:28.645 --> 04:30.021
Talk to him?

04:31.856 --> 04:33.650
After what he did?

04:34.108 --> 04:36.319
I have to
be practical.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.196
It is the best way.

04:38.905 --> 04:40.365
It is our way.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.493
I will send
messengers to him
and if he kills them,

04:43.576 --> 04:45.036
I will know
where he stands.

04:46.663 --> 04:48.081
And he will
know where you are.

04:48.164 --> 04:49.999
He would
find out anyway.

05:02.887 --> 05:05.223
I wish you were
coming with me.

05:10.103 --> 05:11.604
No, you don't.

05:13.064 --> 05:15.984
You said yourself,
this is your destiny,
not mine.

05:17.694 --> 05:19.654
Your mistakes are yours

05:20.822 --> 05:22.532
and so are
your successes.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.330
So, are you going
to England?

05:30.832 --> 05:32.667
That is the plan.

05:33.084 --> 05:34.669
And who will sail
with you?

05:37.755 --> 05:39.882
Somehow I will
work it out.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.596
There is one thing I
need your help with.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.433
What?

05:52.562 --> 05:54.022
I need ships.

05:57.150 --> 05:58.443
I will give you ships.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.950
That was easy.

06:14.834 --> 06:17.378
You've become
a man in my absence.

06:19.839 --> 06:21.299
I'm proud of you.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.773
What are you
laughing at? Hmm?

06:39.776 --> 06:42.153
She's my special
servant now.

06:44.781 --> 06:47.992
And she has
a lot of reasons to
be grateful to me.

06:49.327 --> 06:51.162
I'm not sure
I believe you,
little brother.

06:51.704 --> 06:53.456
And I'm sure
you're jealous.

06:55.291 --> 06:58.878
You cannot keep
a slave to yourself.
No, not like that.

07:00.213 --> 07:03.091
Mother, tell them to
stop tormenting me.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.469
It makes me so happy
you are with a woman.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.223
The rest of you
should already
be married.

07:10.348 --> 07:12.183
Ubbe,
you should have children.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.685
I probably
already have.

07:16.104 --> 07:18.022
Just because you
are the sons of a king

07:18.189 --> 07:20.149
does not mean you
can be irresponsible.

07:20.525 --> 07:23.069
It's important
to find a woman
and settle down.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.113
I thought I had
found a woman.

07:25.196 --> 07:27.907
But now Ivar has
taken her away from me.

07:28.699 --> 07:29.867
Skol!

07:32.370 --> 07:34.038
I don't mean love.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.375
You don't have
to love the woman.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.087
As a King's son
you can have as many
women as you like,

07:41.754 --> 07:44.507
but you need
one to breed with.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.969
So then you don't
believe in love?

07:48.052 --> 07:49.345
I didn't say that.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.305
So you loved Ragnar
when you married him?

07:52.390 --> 07:53.933
And he loved you?

07:54.016 --> 07:55.893
Of course
I loved him!

07:57.895 --> 07:59.230
Some say that
you bewitched him.

08:05.069 --> 08:06.445
What is wrong with you?

08:07.029 --> 08:08.948
Nothing's wrong with me.
I just want to know

08:09.031 --> 08:11.868
if she's ever loved
anyone except Harbard.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.412
You remember Harbard,
don't you?

08:16.038 --> 08:18.708
Of course
she has loved
someone else.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.755
She has always loved me?

08:29.969 --> 08:32.013
Isn't that right, Mother?

08:33.556 --> 08:34.974
She felt pity
for you.

08:37.268 --> 08:38.561
That's all.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.857
We all feel
pity for you.

08:44.025 --> 08:47.820
But sometimes we wish
that she'd left
you to the wolves.

08:49.488 --> 08:50.740
Sigurd!

08:50.990 --> 08:51.991
What?

09:09.342 --> 09:10.384
Ivar!

09:10.843 --> 09:12.470
It is all right.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.890
You're coming
over here?

09:18.976 --> 09:20.269
Go on, Boneless!

09:29.487 --> 09:31.197
Go on, little Ivar.

09:31.948 --> 09:34.116
What are you
going to do?

09:43.834 --> 09:45.461
Stop! Stop! Stop!

10:31.090 --> 10:32.466
It's good to be in Kattegat.

10:32.550 --> 10:34.385
Yeah, it'll be good.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.787
He's not scared of him.

11:01.871 --> 11:03.414
No. I'm telling you,
he was afraid.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.424
Mother!

11:16.135 --> 11:17.511
And Astrid.

11:19.138 --> 11:20.848
What has brought
you to Kattegat?

11:22.141 --> 11:25.186
I have to watch
my son depart
for his destiny.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.729
How could I stay away?

11:35.571 --> 11:37.364
Welcome to the feast.

11:37.573 --> 11:38.908
Thank you, Bjorn.

11:43.454 --> 11:45.498
Halfdan.
King Harald.

11:45.581 --> 11:48.209
Bjorn Ironside!
It's been a long time.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.128
Come,

11:51.295 --> 11:53.214
you have not been idle.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.716
We have all heard
of your exploits.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.842
Yes.

11:56.926 --> 11:58.219
That you captured Rogaland

11:58.302 --> 12:00.638
and overthrew King Arnarson
and Earl Eyjolf.

12:00.721 --> 12:01.847
Yes.
Hmm.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.809
And also King Svein.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.352
Hmm.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.148
Then you are nearer
to your ultimate ambition.

12:11.941 --> 12:13.818
Of being King of Norway.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.823
I think it is
impossible, Bjorn.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.369
How can I ever
overthrow King Ragnar?

12:26.163 --> 12:29.750
As for you, Bjorn,
I want to say
we believe in you.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.710
We believe
in this journey.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.630
And we believe that
the gods are with you.

12:35.673 --> 12:36.882
Indeed.

12:38.676 --> 12:41.846
Astrid!
Come, have a drink.

12:49.395 --> 12:51.272
Come meet my brothers.

12:55.943 --> 12:59.613
Ubbe, Hvitserk,
Sigurd and Ivar.

12:59.697 --> 13:01.282
Ah.
Hvitserk is coming with us.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.785
I remember you,
I remember all of you!

13:04.869 --> 13:07.830
But how you've
all grown tall.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.331
You're not boys anymore!

13:10.875 --> 13:13.419
I am so much taller
when I stand up!

13:13.711 --> 13:16.213
I'm sure you wish
you could come with us.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.633
Go to Hel!

13:21.218 --> 13:22.386
I like him.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.055
Floki!

13:25.681 --> 13:27.141
Floki!
Harald.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.559
Floki!

13:28.642 --> 13:29.643
Good to see you.

13:29.768 --> 13:30.769
So good to see you.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.646
Come, come see Helga!

13:35.232 --> 13:36.734
Helga!
Hello.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.528
We were wondering
if you survived.

13:39.612 --> 13:40.988
Yes, Helga.

13:43.741 --> 13:45.409
All these years...

13:46.076 --> 13:49.330
All these years
we've dreamed of
this very moment.

13:49.413 --> 13:50.789
I have a new boat
to show you, Harald.

13:50.873 --> 13:51.832
Yes?

13:51.916 --> 13:54.418
A boat that will
take us to new worlds.

13:54.919 --> 13:56.503
We should drink to that.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.591
Skol.
Skol.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.451
Queen Aslaug.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.870
Earl Ingstad.

14:33.666 --> 14:36.210
Whatever our differences,

14:36.293 --> 14:38.295
it seems that
my son Bjorn

14:38.379 --> 14:41.632
and your son Hvitserk
will go on this
journey together.

14:41.715 --> 14:45.552
And so
we must wish them both
the luck of the gods.

14:47.638 --> 14:49.390
Perhaps we should
make a sacrifice.

14:49.473 --> 14:52.643
We should.
And we can both officiate.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.690
You forget, Lagertha,
I am the Queen.

14:59.984 --> 15:01.944
I never forget anything.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.783
...comes along,
and it flows.

15:07.866 --> 15:08.993
A toast!

15:09.827 --> 15:13.956
To all of us!
Reunited and
stronger than ever!

15:14.290 --> 15:16.292
- Skol!
- Skol!

15:49.366 --> 15:50.784
Did he see you?
No.

15:50.868 --> 15:51.952
Did he see you leaving?

15:52.077 --> 15:53.162
No, no. But why?

15:53.245 --> 15:56.915
He's crazy.
He wanted to kill me.
I am frightened of him.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.960
Ivar? He's just a cripple.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.880
What do you mean,
just a cripple?

16:03.380 --> 16:06.717
He's the strongest,
most violent man
I have ever known.

16:07.051 --> 16:09.595
And I want to be
protected from him.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.640
Why did he
want to kill you?

16:15.434 --> 16:16.935
In case I told you.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.313
Told me what?

16:21.065 --> 16:23.400
Told me what?
You can tell me.

16:23.859 --> 16:26.153
That he cannot
satisfy a woman.

16:28.113 --> 16:31.325
You won't say anything,
will you, Sigurd?

16:31.408 --> 16:32.993
I won't tell anyone.
Do you swear?

16:33.077 --> 16:34.495
I won't tell anyone.

16:34.578 --> 16:35.662
If he found out...

16:35.746 --> 16:38.165
I won't tell anyone.
All right?

16:40.918 --> 16:42.252
Thank you.

16:44.338 --> 16:45.589
Poor Ivar.

16:47.925 --> 16:48.926
Yeah.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.552
Poor Margrethe.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.014
I suppose you
had to console her.

16:54.598 --> 16:55.808
I did what I could.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.436
Hmm.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.607
She's terrified of him.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.069
So am I, Sigurd.

17:11.115 --> 17:12.449
So am I.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.770
I know you can hear me.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.942
I want you to know

19:53.193 --> 19:58.407
that I can never
forgive you for taking away
my husband and my world.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.037
And look what
you've done with it!

20:15.674 --> 20:17.634
You call yourself Queen.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.680
But you will never
be Queen in Kattegat.

20:42.617 --> 20:46.246
What are you
digging your hoard up for?
Huh?

20:46.330 --> 20:49.916
Everything you saved
to spend after your death.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.423
I have no choice!

20:56.506 --> 20:59.760
I have to bribe people
to sail with me.

21:01.345 --> 21:02.679
You're a loser.

21:02.763 --> 21:06.183
Why don't you come
and help me lift,
cripple boy?

21:17.444 --> 21:19.029
Good boy.

21:27.871 --> 21:30.957
Halfdan, King Harald,
go with the gods.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.376
We will. And you.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.835
More fresh water.
Bring it.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.295
You, help me here.

21:35.379 --> 21:37.214
- ...bring you blessings.
- Something from the...

21:37.297 --> 21:40.300
I will bring, from the land
of the eternal sun.

21:40.384 --> 21:43.053
Yeah, put it there.
Yes, down there, yeah.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.680
Helga?

21:45.847 --> 21:47.641
May the gods bless you.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.685
Listen to her.
Be brave and take my ax.

21:51.436 --> 21:54.189
- And look after your shield.
- Don't lose your shield!

21:54.272 --> 21:57.275
- I hear of their red wine.
- I want to taste it.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.030
Careful now!
It's slipping!

22:11.832 --> 22:13.500
Now, now,
put it straight
back on the boat.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.919
We need a hand.
Bring the other one.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.380
Inge!
Go and help your father!

22:18.463 --> 22:20.132
I'm coming!

22:21.258 --> 22:23.385
Wish him luck.
Come back for more.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.805
Be strong. Be safe.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.767
I will.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.062
Don't come back
unless you have seen

22:34.187 --> 22:36.314
or done
something extraordinary.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.358
Otherwise, you will
not be in the stories

22:38.442 --> 22:40.026
and what will I be
able to tell our children

22:40.110 --> 22:43.613
about their famous father,
Bjorn Ironside?

22:48.869 --> 22:52.330
Tell them that
I love them.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.926
Yes, they will.
It's very warm.

23:08.096 --> 23:09.055
It's pulling to the left.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.140
Take it.

23:10.223 --> 23:13.268
You cannot pay enough gold
for this adventure!

23:22.444 --> 23:24.905
May you wet your
blade with blood.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.706
May the gods be
with you, brother.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.001
Come back!
Tell me your stories.

23:45.509 --> 23:48.762
What a beautiful dragon
you've built for us, Floki.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.477
Now, let's fly her
to Rome.

24:00.982 --> 24:04.778
They'll sign up
all right, Father.
But they will be the worst.

24:06.404 --> 24:07.531
They'll be shit.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.409
The dregs.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.301
Who is this?

24:38.311 --> 24:40.105
That is King Ecbert.

24:43.066 --> 24:44.568
Can I keep it?

25:12.012 --> 25:13.054
Check the big one
at the top.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.567
Well, just know there was
one yesterday.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.860
It was empty.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.029
Who exactly is going

25:29.112 --> 25:31.114
to pay for all this,
young Ivar?

25:59.142 --> 26:02.771
Go on. Take it.
Ah, that's a good choice,

26:03.063 --> 26:05.899
I got that from Lindisfarne.
Go on, go on.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.942
Here you go. Here. Hey.

26:08.026 --> 26:09.611
What are
you doing, Father?

26:10.195 --> 26:11.404
What does it look like?

26:11.488 --> 26:12.864
It looks like you're
humiliating yourself.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.240
Here you go.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.659
You give me that.
No.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.330
I don't care.

26:20.455 --> 26:21.748
What if we care, Father?

26:25.668 --> 26:27.045
Go.

26:28.171 --> 26:29.255
Ah!

26:30.006 --> 26:31.216
Friend.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.177
Have you changed
your mind?

26:34.302 --> 26:35.512
Perhaps.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.349
For that I will
sail with you.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.732
No, Father!

26:50.235 --> 26:52.404
Take it. Take it.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.796
Thank you.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.049
Take it! Take it!

27:14.884 --> 27:16.261
Take it!

27:44.581 --> 27:46.332
What are you doing?

27:49.002 --> 27:51.087
I am going with Father.

27:54.424 --> 27:55.884
What do you mean?

27:56.926 --> 27:58.928
I am sailing
to England.

28:06.102 --> 28:09.939
Tell your father
I need to speak to him.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.694
He can't avoid me
any longer.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.150
My wife.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.031
And mother of my sons.

29:01.324 --> 29:05.995
We both know that love
was not what
brought us together.

29:11.626 --> 29:13.670
But you've endured me.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.217
You've suffered my words,

29:20.635 --> 29:22.178
and my neglect.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.022
Yet you never turned
our sons against me.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.863
I am sure that
there are times
when you've hated me,

29:44.200 --> 29:46.869
but you never
poisoned their minds

29:48.329 --> 29:50.707
or stopped them
from loving me.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.003
And for all of that,

29:57.630 --> 29:59.841
with all my heart

30:02.260 --> 30:04.554
I am grateful to you.

30:23.072 --> 30:25.199
Why are you
saying this now?

30:29.203 --> 30:31.414
Because it needed
to be said.

31:30.682 --> 31:33.976
You told them!

31:34.143 --> 31:36.312
No, I didn't. I swear.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.441
I do not believe you.

31:41.234 --> 31:43.986
It's true!
I swear it, Ivar!
I swear it!

31:47.490 --> 31:48.700
Hush.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.077
I believe you.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.125
Just let me lie
here beside you,

31:58.793 --> 32:00.461
and touch you.

33:46.818 --> 33:49.320
Ivar! Ivar!

33:50.112 --> 33:51.364
Mother.

33:54.784 --> 33:56.160
You can't go.

33:56.953 --> 33:58.871
What are you
talking about?

33:58.955 --> 34:01.082
There's going to
be a storm.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.418
Everything will
end in disaster.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.638
You've seen that?

34:15.930 --> 34:17.598
Yes, I've seen it.

34:22.144 --> 34:23.688
You will drown.

34:24.397 --> 34:26.023
I've seen it.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.818
You can't go.

34:28.901 --> 34:31.404
Stop telling me
what to do, Mother.

34:40.079 --> 34:44.500
Mother, all my life
you have been
suffocating me.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.964
Paying me

34:50.047 --> 34:53.009
so much special attention.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.803
Why?

34:56.679 --> 34:58.347
Why Ivar?

35:00.349 --> 35:02.268
Because I'm a cripple.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.231
Poor Ivar.

35:12.194 --> 35:14.488
And now poor Ivar
has a chance,

35:14.572 --> 35:17.617
finally, to prove
himself for the gods.

35:20.536 --> 35:23.956
I will not let
you take that away
from me, Mother.

35:24.582 --> 35:26.375
You will die, Ivar.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.629
I don't care if I die.

35:35.676 --> 35:36.928
Mother,

35:39.221 --> 35:40.473
I love you.

35:46.145 --> 35:50.691
But just one day
with my father,

35:52.026 --> 35:53.402
being a man,

35:57.406 --> 36:00.743
that's worth
a lifetime of pity.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.342
Go.

38:02.531 --> 38:05.242
Hurry up.
We've got a tide to catch.

38:07.995 --> 38:08.996
Hmm.

38:59.046 --> 39:00.256
You all right?

39:14.395 --> 39:16.355
I'm terrified of water.

39:23.445 --> 39:26.782
There are plenty
of worse ways to die
than to drown.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.399
Hold the sails!

40:52.451 --> 40:53.744
Let go!
