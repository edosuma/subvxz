01:34.860 --> 01:37.427
<i>Women do not have the
calmness of temperament</i>

01:37.428 --> 01:39.195
<i>or the balance of mind</i>

01:39.196 --> 01:42.299
<i>to exercise judgment
in political affairs.</i>

01:44.035 --> 01:45.936
<i>If we allow women to vote,</i>

01:45.937 --> 01:48.371
<i>it will mean the loss
of social structure.</i>

01:48.372 --> 01:52.243
<i>Women are well represented by
their fathers, brothers, husbands.</i>

01:54.178 --> 01:55.880
<i>Once the vote was given,</i>

01:55.881 --> 01:58.282
<i>it would be impossible
to stop at this.</i>

01:58.283 --> 02:01.285
<i>Women would then demand
the rights of becoming MPs,</i>

02:01.286 --> 02:03.287
<i>cabinet ministers, judges.</i>

02:52.870 --> 02:56.239
Maud, take this up the West End.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.310
It's meant to be there by 6:00.

02:59.311 --> 03:01.947
Deliveries should have picked it up.

04:18.055 --> 04:20.089
Votes for women!

04:21.159 --> 04:24.127
Votes for women!

04:24.128 --> 04:26.831
Votes for women!

04:39.143 --> 04:42.012
Victory will be ours!

04:42.013 --> 04:44.113
Votes for women!

04:44.114 --> 04:46.115
Victory!

04:56.094 --> 04:59.364
Votes for women!

05:22.354 --> 05:24.087
Is George sleeping?

05:24.088 --> 05:27.958
Yeah. Mrs. Garston fed him bread and jam.

05:29.193 --> 05:31.428
You all right? It's late.

05:31.429 --> 05:34.063
Taylor sent me up to town.

05:34.064 --> 05:36.733
- Have a look.
- It's nothing.

05:36.734 --> 05:39.469
I got caught in a scuffle.

05:39.470 --> 05:41.738
There were loads of those women shouting.

05:41.739 --> 05:44.341
Broke all the windows on the West End.

05:45.576 --> 05:49.247
I'll deliver that package
for you in the morning.

05:54.352 --> 05:57.155
- You coming to bed?
- I'm just gonna get this done.

06:27.684 --> 06:30.253
Arms up.

06:30.254 --> 06:33.223
Arms up. You keep doing that,

06:33.224 --> 06:35.459
you're never gonna get it on.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.761
Here's the slippers.

06:40.465 --> 06:42.298
All right, dear.

06:42.299 --> 06:46.536
Oh, come here. Be good.

06:46.537 --> 06:48.739
Come on, you lot.

07:11.496 --> 07:16.166
Oi, Mrs. Miller! Mrs. Miller!

07:16.167 --> 07:18.135
- Don't you ignore me.
- Sorry, Mr. Taylor.

07:18.136 --> 07:20.370
- Late again?
- Oh, I'm fairly late. I'm...

07:20.371 --> 07:23.606
Shut your mouth. You listen to me.

07:23.607 --> 07:26.543
That's the second time you've been late
and you've only been here three weeks.

07:26.544 --> 07:28.878
- I haven't been late...
- Don't answer me back. This is what I'm telling you.

07:28.879 --> 07:30.848
- I'm sorry.
- You want me to dismiss you? Is that it?

07:30.849 --> 07:32.815
No. No, Mr. Taylor. No, sir, I don't.

07:32.816 --> 07:36.152
- I won't be late tomorrow.
- Well, you pull your finger out.

07:36.153 --> 07:37.753
Drive belt's loose again.

07:37.754 --> 07:39.856
It was checked on Friday, Maud.

07:39.857 --> 07:43.726
You can smell burning. I'd check 'em all.

07:43.727 --> 07:46.396
Get your toolbox!

07:46.397 --> 07:50.300
Check the drive belt on number six!

07:50.301 --> 07:52.102
Ta.

07:54.138 --> 07:56.906
We meet Mondays and Thursdays,
if you're interested.

07:56.907 --> 07:58.774
The Ellyns pharmacy.

07:58.775 --> 08:01.078
Hey, Maud.

08:02.614 --> 08:04.615
That package get to Barclays yesterday?

08:04.616 --> 08:06.884
George had his chest again.

08:06.885 --> 08:10.287
Sonny took it up for me this morning.

08:18.462 --> 08:21.531
You ready?

08:21.532 --> 08:24.267
This is my oldest.

08:24.268 --> 08:26.202
Maggie.

08:26.203 --> 08:28.238
Hello, Maggie.

08:30.174 --> 08:34.544
It is men who have all
legal rights over our children.

08:34.546 --> 08:37.246
It is men who control
our economic existence.

08:37.248 --> 08:39.482
Who's that?

08:39.484 --> 08:42.219
MP's wife. Mrs. Haughton.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.521
She's here at Christmas giving
out tangerines to the children.

08:44.522 --> 08:46.757
And the prime minister, Mr. Asquith,

08:46.758 --> 08:49.493
has agreed to a hearing of
testimonies of working women

08:49.494 --> 08:51.195
up and down the country.

08:51.196 --> 08:53.430
We have an opportunity to demonstrate

08:53.431 --> 08:56.400
that as women are equal
to men in their labors,

08:56.401 --> 08:59.302
so they should be equal to
men in their right to vote.

08:59.303 --> 09:01.838
You've never labored in your life.

09:01.839 --> 09:04.840
This is your moment to
come forward and speak up,

09:04.841 --> 09:07.777
and I will choose one
person from this laundry

09:07.778 --> 09:10.647
to deliver their testimony
at the House of Commons.

09:10.648 --> 09:13.816
These will be heard by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Mr. Lloyd George.

09:13.817 --> 09:15.752
No one cares, love.

09:15.753 --> 09:18.622
Some of us do, Mrs. Coleman,
so shut your bleeding cake-hole.

09:18.623 --> 09:21.492
Hear, hear.

09:22.826 --> 09:25.228
Thank you for your
support. Votes for women.

09:25.229 --> 09:28.732
Ladies, votes for women.
The power is in your hands.

09:28.733 --> 09:31.267
- Thank you, ladies.
- Oh, go home.

09:31.268 --> 09:34.338
Votes for women. Thank you.

09:34.339 --> 09:36.272
Mommy! Mommy!

09:36.273 --> 09:38.309
Hello, kids. Give me half a moment.

09:39.844 --> 09:42.311
Are you gonna give your testimony then?

09:42.312 --> 09:44.480
Mr. Taylor's a good employer.

09:44.481 --> 09:46.983
- To you he is.
- Take that back.

09:46.984 --> 09:48.919
I can't take back what I see.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.956
- You've been here less than a month.
- And?

09:53.657 --> 09:56.026
I've been doing laundry
work ever since I was 13.

09:56.027 --> 09:58.695
Maggie's only 12, and
she's in here already.

09:58.696 --> 10:01.297
It's as tough for us
women as it's ever been.

10:01.298 --> 10:03.598
We've got to do whatever
we can, however we can.

10:03.599 --> 10:06.536
What, like smashing windows?
It's not respectable.

10:06.537 --> 10:08.638
Strangle what's respectable.

10:08.639 --> 10:10.507
You want me to respect the law,

10:10.508 --> 10:13.011
then make the law respectable.

10:16.346 --> 10:18.448
So, Georgie... Georgie, this is six.

10:18.449 --> 10:19.949
Yeah?

10:19.950 --> 10:22.286
You ready? You watching?

10:29.661 --> 10:31.295
You got yours.

10:40.571 --> 10:42.071
You see Mrs. Haughton today?

10:42.072 --> 10:45.742
Wants some of the women
to go to Parliament.

10:45.743 --> 10:48.578
She thinks we should be paid more.

10:48.579 --> 10:51.381
On her high horse again.

10:57.888 --> 11:00.458
Say good night to the king, George.

11:04.796 --> 11:07.430
Good night, sir.

11:07.431 --> 11:09.467
Good boy.

11:19.076 --> 11:20.810
Come on.

11:23.380 --> 11:26.550
<i>Now, young sir, can you
give me a big breath in, please?</i>

11:27.984 --> 11:29.953
Ah. Good boy.

11:29.954 --> 11:32.055
And out.

11:32.056 --> 11:36.026
And now another big one, please.

11:36.027 --> 11:37.860
And big breath out.

11:37.861 --> 11:41.464
Good boy. And a big breath in.

11:41.465 --> 11:44.501
Oh, yes. Here comes the 11:00
just passing through the tunnel.

11:44.502 --> 11:46.570
Good. It's on time.

11:46.571 --> 11:51.407
Uh... He's all right.

11:51.408 --> 11:54.377
Good boy.

11:54.378 --> 11:55.911
You're a suffragette, Mrs. Ellyn?

11:55.912 --> 12:00.017
Yes, but I consider myself
more of a soldier, Mrs. Watts.

12:01.853 --> 12:04.087
These women's testimonies
make a difference?

12:04.088 --> 12:06.757
Maybe. But as Mrs. Pankhurst says,

12:06.758 --> 12:10.261
"It's deeds, not words
that will get us the vote."

12:12.430 --> 12:15.132
Make up a combination.

12:15.133 --> 12:18.001
Now, George, do you like barley sugar?

12:20.437 --> 12:23.940
Afternoon. Are the others here yet?

12:23.941 --> 12:27.111
Uh, no. Not yet. But you can go through.

12:29.513 --> 12:35.585
Plenty of steam. Couple of
drops in the water, twice daily.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.655
Keep him warm.

12:38.656 --> 12:41.626
No, no. No charge.

12:43.561 --> 12:45.896
- Good-bye.
- Thank you.

12:45.897 --> 12:48.565
- Thank you, Mr. Ellyn.
- Mrs. Watts.

12:48.566 --> 12:50.934
Come on.

12:50.935 --> 12:53.504
Let's get you wrapped up.

13:10.654 --> 13:12.522
Superintendent Burrill.

13:12.523 --> 13:14.757
Mr. Haughton, thank you for
coming here. This is Inspector...

13:14.758 --> 13:16.459
Inspector Sneed. Benedict
Haughton, Home Office.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.494
I'm reliably informed

13:18.495 --> 13:20.664
that you have considerable experience of
surveillance within the Special Branch.

13:20.665 --> 13:23.867
I've gathered intelligence
on various anarchists, sir,

13:23.868 --> 13:27.070
including Fenian agitators
in Liverpool and Manchester.

13:27.071 --> 13:28.772
I can show you.

13:28.773 --> 13:31.007
Employment of these cameras

13:31.008 --> 13:33.877
would be the first of
its kind in the country.

13:33.878 --> 13:36.179
They are considerably more advanced
than anything we've used before.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.047
Thank you.

13:38.048 --> 13:41.251
Compact enough to be used without a tripod.

13:41.252 --> 13:45.456
It means we can operate
them covertly on the streets.

13:47.825 --> 13:49.792
Right.

13:49.793 --> 13:52.628
Let's start with Mrs. Edith Ellyn.

13:52.629 --> 13:54.230
Chief commandant. She's clever.

13:54.231 --> 13:57.834
Been arrested nine
times, incarcerated four.

13:57.835 --> 13:59.502
She's educated without scruples,

13:59.503 --> 14:01.137
which makes her particularly dangerous.

14:01.138 --> 14:04.107
It's worth noting her
husband, Mr. Hugh Ellyn.

14:04.108 --> 14:05.941
Pharmacist.

14:05.942 --> 14:09.979
He's been incarcerated twice for
abetting his wife's activities.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.583
Fully paid-up member of the Men's League.

14:14.685 --> 14:16.786
Here's an old hand... Mrs. Violet Miller.

14:16.787 --> 14:20.156
She moves around a lot. Been arrested
a number of times. Incarcerated twice.

14:20.157 --> 14:23.792
Spits out children.
Husband's a violent drunk.

14:23.793 --> 14:26.262
She agitates. Gets her hands dirty.

14:26.263 --> 14:28.131
She'll be using her zeal to recruit.

14:28.132 --> 14:30.934
To justify the unjustifiable.

14:30.935 --> 14:33.903
Now, who's this here?

14:33.904 --> 14:35.805
Um, Watts. Maud Watts.

14:35.806 --> 14:38.775
Not seen her before.

14:48.319 --> 14:51.887
- That's a good girl. Come on. Come on.
- No! Get off.

14:51.888 --> 14:53.757
It'll be all right. It'll be all right.

14:53.758 --> 14:57.026
You know who I like.

15:03.868 --> 15:06.571
Get back to work. Go on. Get out of here.

15:32.863 --> 15:36.166
What did you want, Maud?

15:36.167 --> 15:38.767
Fourteen short on soap paddles.

15:38.768 --> 15:41.304
Why don't you tell
acquisitions if we're short?

15:41.305 --> 15:44.239
Eh?

15:44.240 --> 15:47.577
I don't want a slipup like that
to happen again, do you hear?

15:50.013 --> 15:53.583
She reminds me of you at that age.

16:28.051 --> 16:29.853
Oi, Mrs. Miller,

16:29.854 --> 16:32.287
I heard a whisper you've been
chosen to deliver your testimony

16:32.288 --> 16:34.824
- to Mr. Lloyd George.
- Tomorrow.

16:34.825 --> 16:38.228
Leave the vote to us men, eh, Mrs.
Miller? And we'll leave you to the home.

16:38.229 --> 16:40.229
I've already made up the hours.

16:40.230 --> 16:42.065
I worked late Tuesday and Thursday.

16:42.066 --> 16:43.733
And Maggie will mop up any extra.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.901
Why don't you tell Mr. Miller

16:45.902 --> 16:49.039
I'll give you a clip round here and
knock some sense into you if he won't.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.007
It'll do her some good, eh?

16:52.008 --> 16:54.045
Violet.

16:55.713 --> 16:59.684
I'll come with you
tomorrow, hear you speak.

17:08.023 --> 17:10.159
Maud. What are you doing?

17:10.160 --> 17:12.996
I'm just gonna listen.

17:19.136 --> 17:23.874
We want the vote!
We want the vote!

17:38.988 --> 17:40.756
Violet.

17:40.757 --> 17:43.993
Where were you? We waited...

17:45.862 --> 17:48.531
- Violet.
- It's nothing. I'm all right.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.268
Mrs. Haughton's inside.

17:52.269 --> 17:54.605
Well, come on then.

18:09.486 --> 18:12.054
Oh, Mrs. Miller...

18:12.055 --> 18:14.124
Oh, my dear.

18:14.125 --> 18:16.059
Glass House Laundry next.

18:16.060 --> 18:18.227
Sheffield Weavers Union, please
be ready. You'll be straight after.

18:18.228 --> 18:20.396
You cannot deliver your
testimony like this.

18:20.397 --> 18:23.031
Deputations will be heard one by one.

18:23.032 --> 18:25.502
- I'm fine.
- No, Mrs. Miller, you're not.

18:25.503 --> 18:28.003
Lloyd George will dismiss
you and what will you say?

18:28.004 --> 18:30.173
Glass House Laundry.

18:30.174 --> 18:33.076
Maud.

18:33.077 --> 18:35.145
You speak for me.

18:35.146 --> 18:37.012
I can't.

18:37.013 --> 18:39.381
- It <i>is</i> written down.
- No, I'm not... I'm not good at...

18:39.382 --> 18:41.984
- All you'd have to do is read it.
- Please ask someone else.

18:41.985 --> 18:44.521
- Someone can do it better than I can.
- You can tell them.

18:44.522 --> 18:46.321
- We have no time.
- Glass House Laundry, please.

18:46.322 --> 18:48.023
- Violet...
- You can do this.

18:48.024 --> 18:51.028
You can do it. You tell them.

19:14.885 --> 19:17.087
Good luck, Maud.

19:30.033 --> 19:32.968
Shall you begin, Mrs. Miller?

19:32.969 --> 19:35.839
Watts.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.108
It's Mrs. Watts, sir.

19:39.109 --> 19:42.011
Mrs. Miller isn't able to...

19:44.281 --> 19:46.182
I have her testimony.

19:46.183 --> 19:51.454
You work at the Glass House
Laundry in Bethnal Green too?

19:51.455 --> 19:53.289
I was born there.

19:53.290 --> 19:56.160
Then I should like to hear your testimony.

20:09.039 --> 20:12.108
I don't know what to say.

20:12.109 --> 20:14.845
Your mother worked at the laundry?

20:16.312 --> 20:19.616
From when she was 14.

20:19.617 --> 20:23.118
She'd strapped me on her back or
under the copper vats if I'd sleep.

20:23.119 --> 20:25.254
All the women did it who had babies then.

20:25.255 --> 20:27.423
Your employer allowed that?

20:27.424 --> 20:29.591
- He'd have you back as soon as you could.
- He?

20:29.592 --> 20:32.662
Mr. Taylor.

20:32.663 --> 20:35.898
And does your mother
still work at the laundry?

20:35.899 --> 20:39.435
She died when I was four.

20:39.436 --> 20:41.037
I see.

20:41.038 --> 20:44.041
A vat tipped. Scalded her.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.175
What of your father?

20:47.176 --> 20:49.078
Don't know him.

20:49.079 --> 20:52.482
And you've worked for Mr. Taylor...

20:52.483 --> 20:55.150
Part-time from when I was seven.

20:55.151 --> 20:58.053
Full-time from when I was 12.

20:58.054 --> 21:00.389
Don't need much schooling
to laundry shirts.

21:00.390 --> 21:04.060
I was good at collars,
steaming the fine lacing.

21:04.061 --> 21:07.530
Got the hands for it.

21:07.531 --> 21:12.301
I was made head washer
at 17, forewoman at 20.

21:12.302 --> 21:14.937
I'm 24 now, so...

21:14.938 --> 21:18.006
You're young for such a position.

21:18.007 --> 21:20.042
Laundry work's a short
life if you're a woman.

21:20.043 --> 21:22.579
And why is that?

21:23.613 --> 21:29.051
You get your aches and your
chest cough, crushed fingers,

21:29.052 --> 21:31.486
leg ulcers, burns,

21:31.487 --> 21:34.089
headaches from the gas.

21:34.090 --> 21:36.125
We had one girl last year poisoned.

21:36.126 --> 21:37.592
Can't work again. Ruined her lungs.

21:37.593 --> 21:41.698
And your pay?

21:43.132 --> 21:46.101
We get 13 shillings a week, sir.

21:46.102 --> 21:47.637
For a man it's 19.

21:47.638 --> 21:51.607
And we work a third more the hours.

21:51.608 --> 21:55.677
They're outside most days on deliveries,
so at least they're in the fresh air.

21:55.678 --> 21:59.215
What would the vote
mean to you, Mrs. Watts?

22:03.020 --> 22:05.021
I never thought we'd get the vote,

22:05.022 --> 22:08.692
so I've never thought
about what it would mean.

22:10.761 --> 22:13.329
So why are you here?

22:19.602 --> 22:23.373
The thought that we might.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.011
That this life...

22:29.213 --> 22:32.049
There is another way of living this life.

22:37.087 --> 22:39.155
Sorry. My words... I'm not...

22:39.156 --> 22:41.290
No, no.

22:41.291 --> 22:47.663
The finest eloquence is
that which gets things done.

22:47.664 --> 22:50.399
Thank you, Mrs. Watts.

22:50.400 --> 22:54.070
I believe we have all that down.

22:54.071 --> 22:57.773
We shall have a response for you very soon.

22:57.774 --> 23:02.945
An amendment to the bill might just
force the change towards the vote.

23:09.253 --> 23:11.288
Thank you, sir.

23:18.462 --> 23:21.496
Can we please have
Sheffield Weavers Union?

23:34.343 --> 23:38.313
- You've been drinking.
- Just a brandy.

23:38.314 --> 23:41.550
- Mrs. Haughton treated us.
- Mrs. Haughton can afford it.

23:41.551 --> 23:44.220
I spoke, Sonny.

23:44.221 --> 23:45.821
I thought you were just gonna listen.

23:45.822 --> 23:48.724
Violet couldn't, so they asked me.

23:48.725 --> 23:51.093
I was just gonna say
what she would have said,

23:51.094 --> 23:53.795
but then he asked me if I
worked at laundry as well.

23:53.796 --> 23:57.200
And I just started talking.

23:57.201 --> 24:00.471
To Mr. Lloyd George.

24:06.609 --> 24:10.280
- If we got the vote...
- What would you do with it, Maud?

24:11.482 --> 24:14.483
Do the same you do with yours, Sonny...

24:14.484 --> 24:16.519
exercise my rights.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.656
Exercise your rights?

24:20.657 --> 24:22.492
You're a suffragette now?

24:22.493 --> 24:24.860
- One of those Panks?
- No.

24:24.861 --> 24:26.695
Mrs. Miller is.

24:26.696 --> 24:29.432
You know how they like to talk.

24:29.433 --> 24:33.103
You spend your time with her,
that's what they'll call you.

24:37.707 --> 24:40.376
I'm only looking out for you, Maud.

24:41.778 --> 24:44.248
I know.

24:45.715 --> 24:48.918
That's all I've ever done.

25:19.882 --> 25:22.518
- Oi, Maud.
- Violet.

25:22.519 --> 25:25.420
Mrs. Ellyn's invited you to tea.

25:25.421 --> 25:27.389
- Has she?
- Yeah.

25:27.390 --> 25:30.259
She says you've gone and woken
up the dinosaurs of Westminster.

25:53.216 --> 25:56.851
- Where are Mr. Ellyn's certificates?
- Hmm? Oh, he hasn't any.

25:56.852 --> 25:59.355
His father passed the business to him,

25:59.356 --> 26:01.424
but he never really took to chemistry.

26:01.425 --> 26:04.760
I actually wanted to become a doctor.

26:04.761 --> 26:06.963
My father didn't approve.

26:06.964 --> 26:10.500
I'm still good at diagnosis.

26:11.734 --> 26:13.703
So you're married?

26:13.704 --> 26:16.073
Twenty-three years now.

26:17.940 --> 26:19.641
Oh, I had hoped that one day

26:19.642 --> 26:23.479
it might have read "Ellyn and daughters."

26:23.480 --> 26:25.781
One must look to the next generation.

26:25.782 --> 26:29.552
I hear you spoke well.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.463
I was thinking we could take
him to the seaside this summer.

26:40.464 --> 26:44.032
Don't go drinking champagne
on beer money, Maud.

26:44.033 --> 26:46.470
Arms up.

26:47.638 --> 26:50.339
Go to the pictures, Friday.

26:52.775 --> 26:56.678
Give me. Give me. Come here.

27:04.920 --> 27:08.023
Oi, Mrs. Miller. Bet
you wish you were a man.

27:08.024 --> 27:10.425
- Yeah, bet you wish you weren't old.
- Saucy cow.

27:10.426 --> 27:13.129
Come here.

27:18.068 --> 27:20.636
- Wish us luck.
- Luck would be you'd stop this now,

27:20.637 --> 27:22.673
go to work.

27:25.542 --> 27:29.078
- Go on.
- Go.

27:29.079 --> 27:31.647
- You ready?
- Yeah.

27:33.050 --> 27:35.984
Here, Maud.

27:35.985 --> 27:37.953
You look the part.

27:37.954 --> 27:41.956
♪ Shout, shout
Up with your song ♪

27:41.957 --> 27:46.095
♪ Cry with the wind
for the dawn is breaking ♪

27:46.096 --> 27:49.665
♪ March, march

27:49.666 --> 27:53.535
♪ Wide blows our banner
and hope is waking ♪

27:53.536 --> 27:56.906
- Can you see anything?
- They haven't opened the doors yet.

27:56.907 --> 28:00.775
♪ Lo, they call
and glad is their word ♪

28:00.776 --> 28:05.414
♪ Loud and louder it swells ♪

28:05.415 --> 28:07.451
It's him.

28:23.699 --> 28:28.338
The prime minister duly reviewed
all the women's testimonies.

28:29.372 --> 28:33.041
After careful debate with a number of MPs

28:33.042 --> 28:36.646
very sympathetic to the women's cause,

28:38.682 --> 28:40.448
it was carried

28:40.449 --> 28:43.085
that there was not the evidence

28:43.086 --> 28:45.721
to support any change to the suffrage bill.

28:45.722 --> 28:47.756
What?

28:47.757 --> 28:50.693
- No votes for women then, sir?
- No. No votes.

28:50.694 --> 28:52.895
But Mr. Lloyd George
listened. He took it all down.

28:52.896 --> 28:55.598
A sham. A sham. It's a sham!

28:55.599 --> 28:58.567
How dare you!

28:58.568 --> 29:00.668
Liar!

29:00.669 --> 29:03.071
- Liar!
- Liar!

29:03.072 --> 29:06.474
- Liar!
- Shame on you, sir!

29:06.475 --> 29:07.976
Shame on you!

29:07.977 --> 29:10.846
Liar!

29:10.847 --> 29:13.517
Liar!

29:25.928 --> 29:27.929
Go on now. You've had your fun.

29:27.930 --> 29:31.533
Get back!

29:31.534 --> 29:33.837
Move back now! Come on!

29:35.004 --> 29:37.439
Go home!

29:37.440 --> 29:39.875
You won't push me back!

29:39.876 --> 29:42.445
Violet!

29:48.185 --> 29:50.753
Hey, leave her alone!

30:15.779 --> 30:17.814
Don't hurt me!

30:25.054 --> 30:26.254
No!

30:26.255 --> 30:28.891
Leave her! Leave...

30:31.660 --> 30:34.363
Get in here! Get in there!

30:38.268 --> 30:41.204
No! No!

30:48.270 --> 30:50.678
Good afternoon, Officer. Benedict Haughton.

30:50.679 --> 30:52.711
How much is bail, please?

30:52.712 --> 30:54.757
Two pound, sir.

30:58.855 --> 31:01.527
No, Benedict, you must
bail all of the women.

31:01.528 --> 31:03.229
I cannot be the only one to go free.

31:03.230 --> 31:06.162
- Benedict, please.
- I will not.

31:06.163 --> 31:08.897
- How much is the sum?
- Two pound each.

31:10.100 --> 31:14.905
£12 to release all the
women. Please, sign it.

31:17.741 --> 31:19.608
It's my money. It's my money.

31:19.609 --> 31:22.744
You're my wife. You'll act like a wife.

31:22.745 --> 31:25.114
I have humored you, Alice, thus far,

31:25.115 --> 31:26.982
but this is an outrage.

31:26.983 --> 31:28.716
Thank you.

31:28.717 --> 31:30.753
Come on.

31:52.242 --> 31:55.212
I have to fetch my son by 6:00.

31:58.814 --> 32:00.816
I'm late. He'll need his tea.

32:00.817 --> 32:05.053
You won't be home for tea.

32:05.054 --> 32:08.558
Would you like me to contact
your husband, Mrs. Watts?

32:13.629 --> 32:16.832
- I picked up a suffragette last week.
- I'm not a suffragette.

32:17.867 --> 32:20.769
Rough little diamond.

32:20.770 --> 32:25.107
In her bloomers, three bricks.

32:25.108 --> 32:28.277
Works for Mrs. Pankhurst directly.

32:28.278 --> 32:31.146
I asked her why she does it.

32:31.147 --> 32:35.117
She said it makes her life worth something.

32:35.118 --> 32:37.921
She's just the hod carrier.

32:41.725 --> 32:43.958
I'm not a suffragette.

32:43.959 --> 32:46.295
I'm glad.

32:48.932 --> 32:51.032
You know,

32:51.033 --> 32:55.204
they say that the way certain types of women
have been acting these past few months

32:55.205 --> 32:58.339
lends a good deal of color to the argument

32:58.340 --> 33:01.877
that the mental equilibrium of the female
sex is less than that of the male's.

33:01.878 --> 33:04.012
But I don't agree.

33:04.013 --> 33:07.849
There's no madness in it.

33:07.850 --> 33:10.418
They know exactly what they're doing.

33:10.419 --> 33:13.088
But my opinion doesn't matter.

33:13.089 --> 33:17.792
My job is to enforce the law, Mrs. Watts.

33:17.793 --> 33:19.695
So I'm going to give you some advice now,

33:19.696 --> 33:23.131
and I sincerely hope you take it.

33:23.132 --> 33:25.501
You serve your time now.

33:28.303 --> 33:31.272
At worst you'll get a week.

33:31.273 --> 33:35.645
Then you go home to your husband.

33:42.752 --> 33:44.753
They lied to us.

33:46.188 --> 33:48.156
They didn't lie.

33:48.157 --> 33:50.793
They promised nothing. They gave nothing.

34:03.138 --> 34:05.441
Coat.

34:05.442 --> 34:08.775
One set of stockings. Hole. Right foot.

34:08.777 --> 34:11.547
Don't be alarmed, Maud. Stay calm.

34:14.150 --> 34:16.952
We're political prisoners. We have
the right to wear our own clothes.

34:16.953 --> 34:18.987
Arms up.

34:21.123 --> 34:23.458
We have the right...

34:25.094 --> 34:26.829
Please.

34:37.507 --> 34:39.876
Sorry, Georgie.

34:51.186 --> 34:54.789
Oi. Your wife is a fucking disgrace, Sonny.

34:54.790 --> 34:58.327
You should be keeping her under control.

34:58.328 --> 35:01.062
Police are bringing these
bitches to their knees.

35:01.063 --> 35:03.999
At least Maud will be used to that.

35:42.572 --> 35:45.508
Come on, Maud.

35:47.442 --> 35:51.046
She's missing her boy.

35:51.047 --> 35:53.314
We've all been separated
from those we love, Maud.

35:53.315 --> 35:55.584
My mother.

35:55.585 --> 35:58.086
When I was a child, I barely saw her.

35:58.087 --> 36:00.823
She worked day and night,

36:00.824 --> 36:03.524
fighting for me to be
educated as my brother was.

36:03.525 --> 36:06.662
But that didn't come without a sacrifice.

36:07.864 --> 36:10.131
There's Emily.

36:10.132 --> 36:14.236
She's done more time here than any of us.

36:14.237 --> 36:16.470
She's on hunger strike.

36:16.471 --> 36:19.908
Orders from Mrs.
Pankhurst are we're to follow.

36:19.909 --> 36:24.946
If they will not accept us as political
prisoners, we will strike until they do.

36:24.947 --> 36:26.548
Not Maud.

36:26.549 --> 36:29.752
It's her first time here.

36:35.290 --> 36:37.059
- Emily.
- Violet.

36:37.060 --> 36:39.428
We got a new member.

36:39.429 --> 36:42.632
- This is Maud.
- Welcome, Maud.

36:43.933 --> 36:46.102
Faster. Move.

37:20.270 --> 37:22.305
Oh, Hugh.

37:27.342 --> 37:29.577
Welcome, Mrs. Watts. Please, come with us.

37:29.578 --> 37:31.946
I've got to go. I've got to see my son.

37:31.947 --> 37:33.682
Everyone gets one their first time, Maud.

37:33.683 --> 37:36.417
For your first incarceration.

37:36.418 --> 37:39.287
Thanks.

37:39.288 --> 37:43.258
Mrs. Miller, the escalation of violence
from the police will be met with force.

37:43.259 --> 37:45.693
You will receive word.

38:09.485 --> 38:12.956
Are they in? Mrs. Garston!

38:17.993 --> 38:20.062
Sonny?

38:25.634 --> 38:28.236
- How's George?
- Shh. He's asleep.

38:28.237 --> 38:31.573
I'm sorry, Sonny.

38:31.574 --> 38:35.209
Sonny, I tried to get back as quickly
as I could, but they kept me there...

38:35.210 --> 38:37.546
I can't look at you.

38:37.547 --> 38:39.448
You don't know what they did to us.

38:39.449 --> 38:43.452
Us? What's it done to me and George?

38:43.453 --> 38:46.354
I had the police around.

38:46.355 --> 38:48.522
I said I didn't know anything.

38:48.523 --> 38:51.559
Got the whole street whispering.

38:51.560 --> 38:55.130
I covered for you to Taylor, but he knew.

38:59.435 --> 39:02.537
It won't happen again.

39:02.538 --> 39:06.508
- Mama.
- Hi, darling. Mmm.

39:06.509 --> 39:08.577
Get back to bed!

39:08.578 --> 39:11.013
Go on, darling.
I'll be there in a minute.

39:11.014 --> 39:14.250
- Now.
- Go on, darling.

39:19.355 --> 39:23.258
- You eaten?
- Mrs. Garston did her best.

39:23.259 --> 39:26.261
I'll make you some tea.

39:28.663 --> 39:33.299
I waited and waited for you
until it was almost dawn.

39:36.438 --> 39:40.642
I was praying for you to come home.

39:40.643 --> 39:42.912
I'm back now.

39:44.447 --> 39:47.316
You won't ever shame me like that again.

39:58.194 --> 40:02.664
Go on. On your
way. I've had enough of you.

40:02.665 --> 40:04.832
You've been nothing but
trouble since you got here.

40:04.833 --> 40:06.434
I'll see you at home, pal.

40:06.435 --> 40:08.702
I love you.

40:08.703 --> 40:12.074
It's all right.

40:13.643 --> 40:16.713
Votes for women!

40:26.255 --> 40:28.656
Hello, Maud.

40:28.657 --> 40:31.158
Nice to see you're feeling better.

40:31.159 --> 40:33.796
Sonny tells me you've not been well.

40:35.764 --> 40:38.332
It's all right, you know?

40:38.333 --> 40:43.004
I found someone else willing
to, uh, make up the hours.

41:04.393 --> 41:06.695
Mum.

41:06.696 --> 41:09.731
You wait for me here. I won't be long.

41:09.732 --> 41:12.801
Maud.

41:12.802 --> 41:14.870
Violet.

41:14.871 --> 41:19.075
There's a big gathering on Friday.
They're saying she's to speak.

41:20.442 --> 41:22.477
I got to go.

41:22.478 --> 41:24.345
I can't.

41:24.346 --> 41:28.117
You can't not.

42:11.293 --> 42:13.963
If we'd had a girl, what
would we have called her?

42:17.532 --> 42:20.334
Margaret.

42:20.335 --> 42:22.338
After my mother.

42:25.708 --> 42:27.977
What kind of life would she have had?

42:33.215 --> 42:35.383
Same as yours.

42:40.556 --> 42:43.259
I'm working late tonight.

42:46.761 --> 42:49.396
<i>Intelligence confirms a
growing intention to retaliate.</i>

42:49.397 --> 42:51.265
They're putting their strategy in place.

42:51.266 --> 42:54.468
Our contact in Lewisham tells us
Mrs. Pankhurst is to give an address.

42:54.469 --> 42:56.870
- When?
- Any day now. We don't know where yet,

42:56.871 --> 43:01.542
but I'm sure our East London
ladies will lead us there.

43:08.451 --> 43:11.553
- Emily.
- Maud. It's good to see you again.

43:11.554 --> 43:13.254
You've heard her speak before?

43:13.255 --> 43:14.955
Many times. She's without fear.

43:14.956 --> 43:18.928
- Emily, Edith's waiting for us.
- You made it then?

43:20.395 --> 43:23.265
Edith. You're here.

43:23.266 --> 43:25.566
We must hurry. It'll be the first
time she's appeared for months.

43:25.567 --> 43:28.570
They'll be on alert to arrest her.

43:28.571 --> 43:31.240
Hello, Mrs. Pankhurst.

43:35.277 --> 43:38.446
- Good luck, Mrs. Pankhurst.
- Thank you.

44:10.346 --> 44:13.015
Well done!

44:15.051 --> 44:17.452
My friends,

44:17.453 --> 44:19.954
in spite of His Majesty's Government,

44:19.955 --> 44:21.856
I am here tonight.

44:24.560 --> 44:28.363
I know the sacrifice
you have made to be here.

44:28.364 --> 44:33.901
Many of you, I know, are estranged
from the lives you once had.

44:33.902 --> 44:37.439
Yet, I feel your spirit tonight.

44:39.909 --> 44:42.343
For 50 years,

44:42.344 --> 44:45.747
we have labored peacefully
to secure the vote for women.

44:45.748 --> 44:51.419
- We've been ridiculed, battered and ignored.
- Yes.

44:51.420 --> 44:54.689
Now we have realized
that deeds and sacrifice

44:54.690 --> 44:56.457
must be the order of the day.

44:56.458 --> 44:59.528
Yeah!

45:07.737 --> 45:09.803
We are fighting for a time

45:09.804 --> 45:13.140
in which every little
girl born into the world

45:13.141 --> 45:17.912
will have an equal
chance with her brothers.

45:17.913 --> 45:21.850
Never underestimate the power we women have

45:21.851 --> 45:24.685
- to define our own destinies.
- Yes!

45:24.686 --> 45:28.021
We do not want to be lawbreakers.

45:28.022 --> 45:31.092
We want to be lawmakers.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.870
Be militant, each of you in your own way.

45:41.871 --> 45:44.838
Those of you who can
break windows, break them.

45:44.839 --> 45:48.542
Those of you who can further
attack the sacred idol of property,

45:48.543 --> 45:50.111
do so.

45:50.112 --> 45:53.147
We have been left with no alternative

45:53.148 --> 45:55.483
but to defy this government.

45:56.985 --> 46:00.555
If we must go to prison to obtain the vote,

46:00.556 --> 46:02.189
let it be the windows of government,

46:02.190 --> 46:04.426
not the bodies of women
which shall be broken.

46:04.427 --> 46:06.827
Around the back, Maud. Around the back.

46:06.828 --> 46:08.830
I incite this meeting

46:08.831 --> 46:11.865
and all the women in Britain to rebellion.

46:13.636 --> 46:16.870
I would rather be a rebel than a slave.

46:35.056 --> 46:38.359
Don't let Mrs. Pankhurst be arrested!

46:46.502 --> 46:48.703
No surrender!

46:54.243 --> 46:55.876
- Edith.
- Mrs. P.

46:55.877 --> 46:57.512
Dear Emily.

46:57.513 --> 46:59.042
This is Mrs. Watts, Mrs. Pankhurst.

46:59.043 --> 47:01.714
- Maud.
- Thank you, Maud.

47:03.659 --> 47:07.792
Never surrender. Never give up the fight.

47:16.836 --> 47:19.660
Don't! Let go of me!

47:26.975 --> 47:28.910
Don't bother arresting them.

47:28.911 --> 47:30.644
Let their husbands deal with them.

47:30.645 --> 47:33.648
Drop them at their front doors.

48:27.603 --> 48:30.739
Sonny, I'm sorry.

48:31.839 --> 48:34.309
I took you on, Maud.

48:34.310 --> 48:36.910
I thought I could straighten you out.

48:36.911 --> 48:38.680
What if you don't need to?

48:38.681 --> 48:40.347
You're a mother, Maud.

48:40.348 --> 48:46.053
You're a wife. My wife.
That's what you're meant to be.

48:46.054 --> 48:47.955
I'm not just that anymore.

48:47.956 --> 48:50.624
Sonny! Sonny! What are you doing?

48:50.625 --> 48:53.894
Sonny! Son... Sonny, let... What...

48:53.895 --> 48:55.662
Sonny! Sonny!

48:55.663 --> 48:57.765
- Get out!
- Sonny!

48:57.766 --> 49:00.100
Let me see George! Sonny?

49:00.101 --> 49:02.669
Let me see George. Sonny.

49:02.670 --> 49:04.706
Sonny!

49:11.080 --> 49:14.916
Let me in! I wanna see George!

49:14.917 --> 49:16.952
Sonny!

49:19.955 --> 49:23.591
Hey! You're a disgrace!

49:45.214 --> 49:47.015
Right.

49:47.016 --> 49:49.318
This is it.

50:01.764 --> 50:03.296
Two and six a week.

50:03.297 --> 50:06.267
Make it two and
four. The union will pay.

50:06.268 --> 50:08.470
Go on then.

50:11.706 --> 50:13.173
I'll get you some blankets

50:13.174 --> 50:16.010
and clothes from the WSPU jumble.

50:16.011 --> 50:19.381
They collect stuff for women who...

50:20.915 --> 50:22.984
I'm sorry.

50:35.230 --> 50:37.198
No, no, no, no, no.

50:37.199 --> 50:39.200
Don't cry.

50:39.201 --> 50:43.705
It aggravates them more if
they see it hasn't touched you.

50:43.706 --> 50:46.874
So you practice now with me.

50:46.875 --> 50:49.111
Do it, Maud.

50:54.982 --> 50:58.486
And God shall wipe away all their tears.

50:58.487 --> 51:01.055
And there shall be no more death,

51:01.056 --> 51:05.492
neither sorrow, nor crying.

51:05.493 --> 51:08.763
Neither shall there be any more pain.

51:10.132 --> 51:14.903
For the former things are passed away.

51:22.877 --> 51:26.581
Two and four a week and a bed
of bleeding nails.

51:34.922 --> 51:37.458
Sweet dreams, Maudie.

51:41.830 --> 51:44.064
So Mrs. Pankhurst
is briefly out of hiding.

51:44.065 --> 51:46.334
Gentlemen, this is a deliberate escalation

51:46.335 --> 51:48.769
of which the government cannot accept.

51:48.770 --> 51:50.271
Who knows what they will do next.

51:50.272 --> 51:52.106
They've been given orders to be ready.

51:52.107 --> 51:54.175
The East London branch, in
particular, is to mobilize.

51:54.176 --> 51:55.843
Should we even be taking
these threats seriously?

51:55.844 --> 51:57.778
I would not underestimate the threat.

51:57.779 --> 51:59.312
Neither would the prime minister.

51:59.313 --> 52:02.984
If it's to be tackled,
we need to get closer in.

52:02.985 --> 52:05.086
I hope to track down those
still open to persuasion

52:05.087 --> 52:07.555
and have them infiltrate
and inform on the others.

52:07.556 --> 52:09.524
We've identified weaknesses in their ranks.

52:09.525 --> 52:11.492
We're hoping one of them will break.

52:11.493 --> 52:14.963
So I'm going to release these to the press.

52:17.900 --> 52:20.934
Here. Maud. You seen yourself?

52:20.935 --> 52:22.937
The shame of it.

53:14.022 --> 53:17.158
"Mrs. Pankhurst's Undesirables."

53:19.393 --> 53:24.700
It's not a bad photograph, though. I
might cut it out. Put it on me wall.

53:27.502 --> 53:30.205
I want you out, Maud.

53:40.882 --> 53:43.985
After everything I've done for you.

53:49.357 --> 53:51.591
And how I've paid for it.

54:00.168 --> 54:02.068
Mr. Taylor.

54:02.069 --> 54:04.372
What are you lookin' at?

54:04.373 --> 54:06.406
Call the police!

54:06.407 --> 54:08.676
Come back, Maud!

54:38.406 --> 54:42.810
You'll walk free out of here, today.

54:44.513 --> 54:48.082
In return, you'll help me.

54:48.083 --> 54:51.452
There is information you'll pass to me.

54:51.453 --> 54:53.653
Anything you know, anything you hear,

54:53.654 --> 54:57.792
even if it's only a snippet or a piece
of conversation that's of interest.

55:02.197 --> 55:04.097
Look at me.

55:04.098 --> 55:06.767
He deserved it.

55:09.036 --> 55:13.307
- If I told you...
- And do you think anyone listens to a girl like you?

55:13.308 --> 55:16.845
That anyone cares? They don't.

55:18.013 --> 55:21.481
You're nothing in the world.

55:21.482 --> 55:25.720
I grew up with girls like you, Maud.

55:25.721 --> 55:30.158
People who sacrificed life
for revenge and a cause.

55:31.592 --> 55:34.260
I know you.

55:34.261 --> 55:37.097
And so do they.

55:37.098 --> 55:39.133
They know how to draw on girls like you.

55:39.134 --> 55:43.504
Girls with no money, no prospects,
who want things to be better.

55:43.505 --> 55:45.772
They pimp and they preen and they fluff you

55:45.773 --> 55:49.109
and they tell you you are the
foot soldiers of the cause.

55:49.110 --> 55:51.780
But you're only fodder...

55:53.114 --> 55:55.383
for a battle none of you can win.

55:58.520 --> 56:00.354
I'm offering you a lifeline.

56:00.355 --> 56:02.857
Take it.

56:04.525 --> 56:07.028
Before it is too late.

56:29.284 --> 56:31.319
Come on, George.

56:35.257 --> 56:38.258
George, you're scuffing
your shoes doin' that!

56:38.259 --> 56:41.662
What's the matter with you?
What would your mother say? Eh?

56:41.663 --> 56:43.765
George!

56:48.636 --> 56:51.671
What am I going to do with ya?

56:51.672 --> 56:53.908
Come on.

56:57.612 --> 57:00.247
Maud?

57:00.248 --> 57:02.951
I thought you wouldn't come today.

57:04.585 --> 57:06.887
March on.

57:17.799 --> 57:20.568
- So...
- Next time, get his left hand and all.

57:20.569 --> 57:23.004
It was an accident.

57:24.371 --> 57:28.309
Now, ladies, I ask you to
remain vigilant while coming and going.

57:28.310 --> 57:30.810
Uh, we know we're being watched.

57:30.811 --> 57:33.780
But hopefully, they will
not expect to find us here.

57:33.781 --> 57:38.151
I recognized the militant
path may not be for all of you,

57:38.152 --> 57:41.354
but, well, all I ask is for
you to make your decision now.

57:41.355 --> 57:44.725
Anyone who doesn't want to stay may leave.

57:44.726 --> 57:48.530
I need only those who can
give their full commitment.

57:49.864 --> 57:52.032
There will be no judgment.

57:57.404 --> 57:59.339
Good. We can begin.

57:59.340 --> 58:01.475
Violet, the map, please.

58:01.476 --> 58:04.310
Now...

58:04.311 --> 58:07.914
I have marked up a map.

58:07.915 --> 58:10.417
The pillar boxes are red.

58:10.418 --> 58:13.320
The telegraph wires are green.

58:13.321 --> 58:16.423
We shall cut into the
heart of communications.

58:16.424 --> 58:20.727
But remember, it is vital that no
life is harmed during your activities.

58:20.728 --> 58:23.530
We shall start early, before dawn.

58:23.531 --> 58:26.566
That way the streets should be deserted.

58:26.567 --> 58:31.472
Everyone take a list of the locations.

58:31.473 --> 58:34.675
Memorize them, then burn them.

58:34.676 --> 58:38.814
We don't want them falling
into the wrong hands, do we?

58:50.424 --> 58:53.794
You're it.

58:53.795 --> 58:57.198
George. George.

58:57.199 --> 59:00.301
George.

59:00.302 --> 59:02.904
Shh, shh.

59:04.639 --> 59:06.439
Mmm, darling.

59:10.411 --> 59:13.881
How slow. Georgie,
you can run faster than that.

59:13.882 --> 59:16.249
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Run, run, run.

59:16.250 --> 59:17.952
- No!
- That's it.

59:19.453 --> 59:20.720
Come here.

59:20.721 --> 59:22.455
Unbelievable, you.

59:24.491 --> 59:27.327
- Who dressed you this morning?
- Dad.

59:27.328 --> 59:29.296
Dad.

59:31.665 --> 59:33.968
You still got your nightshirt on.

59:33.969 --> 59:37.338
When you coming home?

59:37.339 --> 59:39.607
I don't know.

59:40.976 --> 59:43.577
Have you done
something very bad, Mama?

59:43.578 --> 59:47.915
Don't think so. I just can't
come home at the moment.

59:54.389 --> 59:56.925
Is it because of your sickness?

59:58.259 --> 01:00:01.629
Dad says you're not well in the head.

01:00:03.431 --> 01:00:06.033
That's not true, George.

01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:09.970
Go on.

01:00:09.971 --> 01:00:12.240
Here you are.

01:00:25.353 --> 01:00:27.888
That's for today.

01:00:27.889 --> 01:00:30.291
That's for tomorrow.

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:33.127
And that's to save till I
see you next. Off you go.

01:00:42.469 --> 01:00:45.005
George. Come inside.

01:00:46.907 --> 01:00:50.644
- Don't take him again, Maud.
- Let me see him. Please.

01:00:50.645 --> 01:00:54.048
Trust you with him?

01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:56.350
After what you did to Taylor?

01:00:56.351 --> 01:01:01.354
What did Taylor do to me, Sonny? For years.

01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:03.589
George belongs to me.

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:05.359
The law says he's mine, Maud.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.928
Where he belongs is up to me.

01:01:07.929 --> 01:01:10.999
That's the law.

01:01:43.897 --> 01:01:47.401
<i>Dear Mr. Steed.</i>

01:01:47.402 --> 01:01:49.068
<i>I thought about your offer,</i>

01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:51.739
<i>and I have to say no.</i>

01:01:53.475 --> 01:01:56.709
<i>You see, I am a
suffragette after all.</i>

01:01:58.446 --> 01:02:01.714
<i>You tell me no one
listens to girls like me.</i>

01:02:01.715 --> 01:02:04.952
<i>Well, I can't have that anymore.</i>

01:02:04.953 --> 01:02:07.421
<i>All my life I've been respectful,</i>

01:02:07.422 --> 01:02:09.155
<i>done what men told me.</i>

01:02:09.156 --> 01:02:12.126
<i>I know better now.</i>

01:02:15.996 --> 01:02:19.233
<i>I'm worth no more, no less than you.</i>

01:02:20.502 --> 01:02:22.068
<i>Mrs. Pankhurst said,</i>

01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:26.472
<i>"If it's right for men to
fight for their freedom,</i>

01:02:26.473 --> 01:02:29.510
<i>then it's right for women
to fight for theirs."</i>

01:03:01.208 --> 01:03:03.544
George, back to bed.

01:03:06.915 --> 01:03:10.484
<i>If the laws
says I can't see my son,</i>

01:03:11.652 --> 01:03:14.655
<i>I will fight to change that law.</i>

01:03:15.924 --> 01:03:18.658
<i>We're both foot
soldiers in our own way.</i>

01:03:18.659 --> 01:03:20.827
- Come on, Maud.
- Everyone, find a partner.

01:03:20.828 --> 01:03:23.564
<i>Both fighting for our cause.</i>

01:03:23.565 --> 01:03:24.765
- Maud.
- I'm all right.

01:03:24.766 --> 01:03:26.533
You have to participate

01:03:26.534 --> 01:03:28.801
if you want to change
the way the world is run.

01:03:28.802 --> 01:03:30.903
- Hyah!
- Ohh!

01:03:30.904 --> 01:03:32.039
Jolly good.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.609
All right, Maudie.

01:03:36.143 --> 01:03:39.479
<i>I won't betray mine.</i>

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.481
<i>Would you betray yours?</i>

01:03:41.482 --> 01:03:45.853
<i>If you thought I would,
you were wrong about me.</i>

01:03:48.623 --> 01:03:51.557
<i>Yours sincerely,</i>

01:03:51.558 --> 01:03:52.892
<i>Maud Watts.</i>

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:15.048
Another explosion at Cadogan Square.

01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:17.751
It's happening all over London,
sir. And telegraph wires cut.

01:04:17.752 --> 01:04:20.220
Miss Withers was seen in the vicinity.

01:04:24.558 --> 01:04:27.594
You get a warrant.

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:32.932
Morning.

01:04:32.933 --> 01:04:34.934
Inspector.

01:04:34.935 --> 01:04:37.104
That's a lot of
worming tablets, Mr. Ellyn.

01:04:37.105 --> 01:04:41.542
- One of life's great parasites, Inspector Steed.
- Is your wife in?

01:04:41.543 --> 01:04:43.544
- Edith!
- Just concluding a treatment.

01:04:43.545 --> 01:04:45.880
I can go through.

01:04:47.648 --> 01:04:50.316
Uh, mastitis.

01:04:50.317 --> 01:04:52.686
See you on Friday.

01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:57.691
You're a wet nurse now, eh, Miss Withers?

01:04:57.692 --> 01:05:00.660
Shall we get this over with?

01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:04.698
You've searched before and found
nothing, but I'm happy to comply again.

01:05:04.699 --> 01:05:09.102
You're a very clever woman, Mrs. Ellyn. I'll
give you that, the way you seduce these women.

01:05:09.103 --> 01:05:13.308
Draw them in, train them in destruction.

01:05:19.746 --> 01:05:22.082
You're under arrest, Miss Withers.

01:05:22.083 --> 01:05:23.684
I'd advise you not to struggle.

01:05:23.685 --> 01:05:25.586
- Take her out.
- Get off!

01:05:25.587 --> 01:05:26.720
Come on.

01:05:26.721 --> 01:05:28.821
Get off! Get off me!

01:05:28.822 --> 01:05:30.923
I'd advise you not
to struggle. Take her out.

01:05:30.924 --> 01:05:32.359
- Am I also to be arrested?
- No!

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.961
Not today, Mrs. Ellyn.

01:05:33.962 --> 01:05:36.028
No! No!

01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:39.900
Let go of me! Oh! Oh!

01:05:42.603 --> 01:05:45.071
Miss Withers will
get six months at least.

01:05:45.072 --> 01:05:48.609
I could do a few weeks, Edith, but...

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:50.343
What are you saying?

01:05:50.344 --> 01:05:52.646
This isn't the time to stand down.

01:05:52.647 --> 01:05:54.847
No, we push on. Capitalize
on press interest.

01:05:54.848 --> 01:05:56.816
The press do nothing but scorn and mock us.

01:05:56.817 --> 01:05:59.853
They scorn and mock us
because they feel our threat.

01:06:00.989 --> 01:06:03.591
- Mrs. Haughton.
- Ladies.

01:06:06.194 --> 01:06:07.995
Have you got the information I asked for?

01:06:07.996 --> 01:06:11.698
Lloyd George's summerhouse
is not yet completed.

01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:14.234
He was complaining about it
at dinner just the other night.

01:06:14.235 --> 01:06:17.671
It's being built next to the
golf course at Walton-on-the-Hill,

01:06:17.672 --> 01:06:20.173
paid for by the owner of
the <i>News of the World.</i>

01:06:20.174 --> 01:06:22.175
Valuable information. Thank you.

01:06:22.176 --> 01:06:25.379
Edith, come here.

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:31.785
Mrs. Watts, how is your son?

01:06:31.786 --> 01:06:33.653
It's his birthday tomorrow.

01:06:33.654 --> 01:06:36.289
I'm so sorry for you.

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:41.193
I trusted my husband and this government.

01:06:41.194 --> 01:06:42.928
I was wrong.

01:06:44.866 --> 01:06:47.334
- I have to go.
- I don't have the strength.

01:06:47.335 --> 01:06:50.169
Please, just listen to me, Edith.

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:52.905
A minister's home? That's going too far.

01:06:52.906 --> 01:06:54.707
Why too far?

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:57.343
It's unoccupied. It is
empty. No one will be harmed.

01:06:57.344 --> 01:07:01.347
Your commitment, Edith. I always knew you'd
take it as far as it must go, but this...

01:07:01.348 --> 01:07:05.085
- Mrs. Pankhurst, she asked us...
- Mrs. Pankhurst asked too much.

01:07:10.123 --> 01:07:12.992
Violet. Vi!

01:07:12.993 --> 01:07:15.428
Listen, you can't do this.

01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:18.465
You can't bring me into
this and then just leave me.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.202
I'm sorry, Maud, but I can't. I'm...

01:07:23.971 --> 01:07:26.841
Not now.

01:07:27.909 --> 01:07:30.410
- Oh, Vi.
- I can't take care of the ones I got.

01:07:30.411 --> 01:07:32.547
Oh.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.716
When are you due?

01:07:37.918 --> 01:07:40.454
Summer.

01:07:42.056 --> 01:07:44.658
Oh, Maud, I'm so sorry.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.618
I just want to wish him happy birthday.

01:08:50.023 --> 01:08:51.858
At least let me do that.

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:53.225
Not now.

01:08:53.227 --> 01:08:55.462
Sonny.

01:08:55.462 --> 01:08:57.029
- Sonny.
- Don't.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.099
- You can't...
- You're too late.

01:09:05.404 --> 01:09:08.307
This is Mr. and Mrs. Drayton.

01:09:08.308 --> 01:09:10.845
They're taking George.

01:09:12.345 --> 01:09:15.346
What are you talking about?

01:09:15.348 --> 01:09:17.783
Adopting him.

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:24.122
- Sonny...
- We have a very nice home, with a garden...

01:09:24.124 --> 01:09:27.894
and all that he'll need.

01:09:27.895 --> 01:09:31.863
- No. George...
- I can't look after him, Maud.

01:09:31.865 --> 01:09:33.399
- Sonny, please.
- I can't be a mother to him.

01:09:33.401 --> 01:09:37.270
We have no family, Maud. No one
to take him. I can't do it all.

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:39.604
- Mrs. Garston won't take him. No one around here will.
- Sonny, just let me...

01:09:39.606 --> 01:09:42.374
- George...
- We've been cast out, Maud. We've been cast out.

01:09:42.375 --> 01:09:46.078
Georgie, come here. Come here. Come here.

01:09:46.078 --> 01:09:48.948
Say your good-byes and then let him go.

01:09:51.451 --> 01:09:53.988
Open your present.

01:10:05.999 --> 01:10:07.868
Georgie...

01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:12.973
your mother's name is Maud Watts.

01:10:14.909 --> 01:10:17.610
Don't forget that name...

01:10:17.611 --> 01:10:21.181
'cause I will be waiting
for you to find me.

01:10:21.182 --> 01:10:24.251
Will you find me, George?

01:10:24.252 --> 01:10:26.587
Don't forget it.

01:10:33.227 --> 01:10:36.562
- Come on.
- No. No. No!

01:10:36.563 --> 01:10:38.330
- Come on, George.
- No. No.

01:10:38.331 --> 01:10:41.133
- Let him... Take him.
- Mama.

01:10:41.134 --> 01:10:45.337
No. Darling. No.

01:10:45.338 --> 01:10:47.940
Sonny... Ohh!

01:10:47.941 --> 01:10:52.378
- Mama.
- Sonny! No!

01:10:55.548 --> 01:10:57.684
- What have you done?
- Maud, it's for the best.

01:10:57.685 --> 01:10:59.084
What have you done?

01:10:59.085 --> 01:11:00.953
- Shush!
- What have you done?

01:11:00.954 --> 01:11:02.955
- It's for the best.
- What have you done?

01:11:02.956 --> 01:11:04.457
- No! No!
- Maud!

01:11:04.458 --> 01:11:06.959
What have you done, Sonny?

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.261
- What have you done?
- Maud...

01:11:09.262 --> 01:11:12.165
What have you done?

01:11:52.173 --> 01:11:55.943
- Can I help you with that?
- No, I can do it.

01:11:58.379 --> 01:12:01.682
So Violet will not be joining us anymore?

01:12:04.451 --> 01:12:07.453
No. She questioned our strategy.

01:12:07.454 --> 01:12:09.355
Our friends are there to challenge us.

01:12:12.058 --> 01:12:14.593
To keep the balances and checks, Edith.

01:12:14.594 --> 01:12:17.763
- No, no. They're can be no doubting.
- The movement is divided now.

01:12:17.764 --> 01:12:21.066
Even Sylvia Pankhurst is opposed to her
mother and her sister's militant strategy.

01:12:21.067 --> 01:12:22.769
The only way is forward.

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:25.538
And what if you blow yourself
up with one of those damn things?

01:12:25.539 --> 01:12:28.374
What happens to your damn cause then?

01:12:51.731 --> 01:12:54.135
- Emily.
- Are you all right?

01:13:20.361 --> 01:13:23.397
Maud!

01:13:36.276 --> 01:13:38.912
Hugh, go.

01:14:02.436 --> 01:14:04.437
Mrs. Watts.

01:14:08.542 --> 01:14:11.278
Come with us, please. You're under arrest.

01:14:34.869 --> 01:14:39.204
When women attack the home
of... of a government minister,

01:14:39.205 --> 01:14:42.508
we have reached a state of
anarchy we can no longer ignore.

01:14:42.509 --> 01:14:44.811
This has to stop.

01:14:44.812 --> 01:14:46.645
The press can only be tamed so long.

01:14:46.646 --> 01:14:49.449
They grow more and more
interested in these damn women

01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:52.253
while we in government must
try to quash every new story.

01:14:53.387 --> 01:14:55.788
Pankhurst claims responsibility
for the bombing and faces prison

01:14:55.789 --> 01:14:57.789
while the real culprits go free.

01:14:57.790 --> 01:15:02.162
She going to milk every ounce
of attention she can in prison.

01:15:02.163 --> 01:15:03.695
We've made some key arrests.

01:15:03.696 --> 01:15:07.833
Punish those responsible
in whatever way you can.

01:15:23.651 --> 01:15:26.586
You women cleaned yourselves up well.

01:15:26.587 --> 01:15:29.489
Couldn't find a scrap of
dynamite on any of you.

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.356
- Then why am I here?
- Oh, you'll be charged.

01:15:31.357 --> 01:15:34.427
For illegal meetings if for nothing else.

01:15:40.767 --> 01:15:44.571
You know there was a housekeeper on
her way back when the bomb went off?

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:49.310
She forgot her gloves.

01:15:50.377 --> 01:15:53.779
If she was two minutes later,

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.949
what would that have done for your cause?

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:59.319
Violence doesn't discern!

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.953
It takes the innocent and the guilty!

01:16:00.954 --> 01:16:03.722
What gives you the right to
put that woman's life at risk?

01:16:03.723 --> 01:16:06.426
What gave you the right to
stand in the middle of a riot

01:16:06.427 --> 01:16:08.660
and watch women beaten and do nothing?

01:16:08.661 --> 01:16:10.829
- You're a hypocrite.
- I uphold the law.

01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:13.266
The law means nothing. I've
had no say in making the law.

01:16:13.267 --> 01:16:14.934
That's an excuse. It's all we have.

01:16:14.935 --> 01:16:17.604
We break windows, we burn things,

01:16:17.605 --> 01:16:19.939
'cause war is the only
language men listen to.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:23.944
'Cause you've beaten us and betrayed
us, and there's nothing else left.

01:16:25.346 --> 01:16:27.480
And there's nothing left but to stop you.

01:16:27.481 --> 01:16:31.516
What are you gonna do? Lock us all up?

01:16:31.517 --> 01:16:35.055
We're in every home. We're half the
human race. You can't stop us all.

01:16:36.789 --> 01:16:39.525
You might lose your
life before this is over.

01:16:41.728 --> 01:16:44.364
And we will win.

01:17:26.072 --> 01:17:30.077
Sylvia, can you hear me?

01:18:39.679 --> 01:18:42.114
Five days. Will you eat now?

01:18:45.017 --> 01:18:47.320
No!

01:18:53.026 --> 01:18:55.229
No!

01:19:04.004 --> 01:19:05.771
Hold her still.

01:19:10.843 --> 01:19:14.213
No! No!

01:19:46.713 --> 01:19:48.848
No!

01:20:00.593 --> 01:20:04.896
Treatment of them grows
increasingly barbaric, sir.

01:20:04.897 --> 01:20:07.766
What is the alternative?

01:20:07.767 --> 01:20:10.903
They will not hold us to
ransom with their threats.

01:20:10.904 --> 01:20:13.105
The fear is they won't break, sir.

01:20:13.106 --> 01:20:17.810
If one of them dies, we'll have blood on
our hands and they'll have their martyr.

01:20:17.811 --> 01:20:19.878
That must not happen.

01:20:19.879 --> 01:20:23.350
Or Mrs. Pankhurst will have won.

01:20:58.552 --> 01:21:00.787
- Hello, Edith.
- Maud.

01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:06.859
- Maud, can I drive you?
- Best not.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:10.262
I've left you bedding at the
church. The union will send you word.

01:21:10.263 --> 01:21:12.498
Emily.

01:21:39.191 --> 01:21:42.229
- Maud?
- Violet.

01:21:43.829 --> 01:21:46.666
I heard you were sleeping here.

01:21:49.303 --> 01:21:53.873
It's only bread and a
bit of broth. That's all.

01:21:53.874 --> 01:21:55.641
A little at a time.

01:21:55.642 --> 01:21:58.312
Your tummy will be sore
what you've been through.

01:21:59.812 --> 01:22:03.949
Whatever you're planning
next, you be careful.

01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:08.254
You get caught again, you'll
see two years inside at least.

01:22:09.356 --> 01:22:10.855
- Maybe longer.
- Violet.

01:22:10.856 --> 01:22:12.892
Maybe worse.

01:22:14.594 --> 01:22:15.794
Oh.

01:22:15.795 --> 01:22:18.565
Little monkey.

01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:25.439
George used to kick me until night.

01:22:29.977 --> 01:22:32.611
How's Maggie?

01:22:32.612 --> 01:22:37.016
Working every hour God
sends down at the laundry.

01:22:37.017 --> 01:22:40.454
She's the only one who can
bring in a proper wage now.

01:22:42.923 --> 01:22:46.026
Now, come on. You eat something.

01:23:06.279 --> 01:23:10.216
- When did they raid?
- First thing this morning. Six arrests.

01:23:10.217 --> 01:23:14.153
Edith, what are you doing
here? You're not well.

01:23:14.154 --> 01:23:17.957
There will be a vigil for Mrs.
Pankhurst tonight at Westminster Abbey.

01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:20.693
She's not going to last
this time in prison, Maud.

01:23:20.694 --> 01:23:24.163
- The king must pardon her.
- He's not going to pardon her, Emily.

01:23:24.164 --> 01:23:27.999
- Then we got to make him.
- How, when the government silences the press?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.869
Look, one column on the bombing.

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:34.105
How do we make ourselves heard?

01:23:34.106 --> 01:23:37.075
One just has to gather one's strength.

01:23:37.076 --> 01:23:39.244
If it is the world's attention
that we must capture...

01:23:39.245 --> 01:23:43.349
We take it straight to the king.
Do something he can't ignore.

01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:46.252
Edith, you're too weak to
face another prison sentence.

01:23:46.253 --> 01:23:49.056
Oh, nonsense, Hugh.

01:23:53.259 --> 01:23:56.128
- Maud, please.
- She's right.

01:23:56.129 --> 01:23:59.766
Every violent assault weakens
her. Her heart cannot take it.

01:24:00.967 --> 01:24:02.569
Maud.

01:24:05.705 --> 01:24:08.474
He's at the Derby on Wednesday.

01:24:08.475 --> 01:24:11.209
The king is to attend.

01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:12.944
There will be thousands there.

01:24:12.945 --> 01:24:14.879
You'll be stopped before
you get through the gates.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.383
In those crowds, we'll go unnoticed.

01:24:19.719 --> 01:24:24.022
We will raise our flag in
front of the world's cameras.

01:24:24.023 --> 01:24:25.391
The king's horse...

01:24:25.392 --> 01:24:28.828
Will be third in the parade ring.

01:24:28.829 --> 01:24:31.396
- Done.
- The eyes of the world upon us.

01:24:31.397 --> 01:24:34.833
Maud, no matter the risk, we must not fail.

01:24:34.834 --> 01:24:37.136
I want you to have this.

01:24:37.137 --> 01:24:39.705
Edith gave it to me.

01:24:43.877 --> 01:24:47.779
It has been an inspiration
to a great many of us.

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.913
Thank you.

01:24:48.914 --> 01:24:50.749
So...

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:53.252
tomorrow then?

01:24:53.253 --> 01:24:55.320
Tomorrow.

01:25:02.395 --> 01:25:06.332
Here's the latest from
surveillance, sir. Miss Maud Watts.

01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:09.069
She's sleeping in St. Paul's church.

01:25:14.941 --> 01:25:16.542
Hugh,

01:25:16.543 --> 01:25:19.043
we ready?

01:25:19.044 --> 01:25:22.314
I just need two milligrams of the
cold salt tincture, if you please.

01:25:22.315 --> 01:25:26.019
Could you not have finished
the orders last night?

01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:31.422
What did you say?

01:25:31.423 --> 01:25:34.860
Cold salt... Hugh?

01:25:34.861 --> 01:25:37.296
Hugh? Hugh!

01:25:39.365 --> 01:25:41.801
- Let me out.
- I can't.

01:25:41.802 --> 01:25:45.037
- What do you mean? What do you mean?
- I'm sorry.

01:25:45.038 --> 01:25:46.504
You've given enough.

01:25:46.505 --> 01:25:48.940
Now we're going to be late. Let me out.

01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:50.476
Please, let me out!

01:25:50.477 --> 01:25:52.845
Your heart won't take it, Edith.

01:25:52.846 --> 01:25:57.315
I can't let you out. I'm sorry.

01:26:42.329 --> 01:26:44.029
Keep to the left, please.

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:47.298
Ladies and gentlemen, to the left, please.

01:26:47.299 --> 01:26:49.970
Please have your tickets ready.

01:26:52.571 --> 01:26:55.908
Please have your tickets
ready, ladies and gentlemen.

01:26:56.977 --> 01:26:58.343
Where's Edith?

01:26:58.344 --> 01:27:00.547
She wasn't at the station.

01:27:10.589 --> 01:27:13.025
- Tickets, please!
- Miss?

01:27:13.026 --> 01:27:16.662
Would you like to take the next
turnstile? The queue's much shorter.

01:27:16.663 --> 01:27:18.531
Ta.

01:28:23.429 --> 01:28:25.064
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

01:28:25.065 --> 01:28:26.565
There he is.

01:28:26.566 --> 01:28:29.001
Your Majesty!

01:28:29.002 --> 01:28:31.370
There's the king.

01:28:34.139 --> 01:28:37.342
- Your Majesty!
- Please, over here!

01:28:37.343 --> 01:28:39.378
Now.

01:28:43.148 --> 01:28:45.284
- Your Majesty!
- Please, over here!

01:28:45.285 --> 01:28:47.151
Majesty!

01:28:47.152 --> 01:28:49.421
Over here!

01:28:49.422 --> 01:28:52.591
Your Majesty!

01:28:52.592 --> 01:28:55.727
Sorry, miss. It's green
badges to enter the paddock.

01:28:55.728 --> 01:28:57.695
Can I help you?

01:28:57.696 --> 01:28:59.464
Thank you very much, sir.

01:28:59.465 --> 01:29:01.967
Sorry.

01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:06.772
We will find another way.

01:29:09.241 --> 01:29:11.810
Sorry. Excuse me.

01:29:13.646 --> 01:29:16.015
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:29:16.016 --> 01:29:19.185
- Let the gentleman through, please.
- Excuse me.

01:29:27.761 --> 01:29:29.695
Follow me.

01:29:33.465 --> 01:29:35.734
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

01:29:35.735 --> 01:29:37.404
Emily.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.110
Emily.

01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:26.218
Excuse me.

01:30:38.364 --> 01:30:40.432
Pardon. Excuse me.

01:30:46.106 --> 01:30:48.507
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:30:48.508 --> 01:30:51.211
Excuse me. Emily.

01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:59.418
Emily.

01:30:59.419 --> 01:31:03.189
Never surrender. Never give up the fight.

01:31:07.192 --> 01:31:08.861
Emily!

01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:13.165
Emily!

01:33:47.587 --> 01:33:49.655
Maggie!

01:33:50.789 --> 01:33:54.493
Maggie. Come on, darling.
Come on, Maggie. Let's go.

01:33:54.494 --> 01:33:56.628
- What are you doing, Mrs. Watts?
- Let's go.

01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:59.330
- Where are you taking me?
- Oi!

01:33:59.331 --> 01:34:01.534
Halt!

01:34:02.701 --> 01:34:04.636
Sorry. Sorry.

01:34:07.307 --> 01:34:09.943
Get back to work!

01:34:26.659 --> 01:34:29.462
Ellen, I'll get the door myself!

01:34:30.929 --> 01:34:32.396
Maud.

01:34:32.397 --> 01:34:34.666
This is Maggie, Violet's daughter.

01:34:34.667 --> 01:34:36.767
She can launder and sew.

01:34:36.768 --> 01:34:40.306
She does the best collar
starching, and she can clean.

01:34:44.677 --> 01:34:46.678
Come in, Maggie.

01:34:47.914 --> 01:34:50.716
Be good. Don't talk back.

01:34:50.717 --> 01:34:52.718
Maud.

01:34:57.589 --> 01:35:00.391
Come in, Maggie. I'm Mrs. Haughton.

01:35:41.066 --> 01:35:45.771
<i>"The woman wanderer goes
forth to seek the land of freedom.</i>

01:35:47.072 --> 01:35:50.075
<i>'How am I to get there?'</i>

01:35:51.444 --> 01:35:54.945
<i>Reason answers,</i>

01:35:54.946 --> 01:35:59.117
<i>'There is one way, and one way only.</i>

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.854
<i>Down the banks of labor,</i>

01:36:02.855 --> 01:36:06.024
<i>through the waters of suffering.</i>

01:36:06.025 --> 01:36:08.459
<i>There is no other.'</i>

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.962
<i>The woman,</i>

01:36:10.963 --> 01:36:16.435
<i>having discarded all to which
she'd formerly clung, cries out,</i>

01:36:16.436 --> 01:36:20.838
<i>'For what do I go to this far land
which no one has ever reached?</i>

01:36:20.839 --> 01:36:24.909
<i>I am alone. I'm utterly alone.'"</i>

01:36:41.593 --> 01:36:43.727
It's in every paper.

01:36:43.728 --> 01:36:47.300
They say thousands will line the streets.

01:36:53.673 --> 01:36:57.710
We go on, Edith.

01:36:59.978 --> 01:37:02.882
You taught me that.

01:37:17.963 --> 01:37:19.797
You want to take that?

01:37:22.535 --> 01:37:24.437
- Daisy.
- Thank you.

01:37:26.204 --> 01:37:30.442
It's almost 1:00, Maggie. Get
your gloves and help Mrs. Ellen.

01:37:48.261 --> 01:37:51.629
<i>"And Reason said to her,</i>

01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:55.301
<i>'Silence. What do you hear?'</i>

01:37:56.902 --> 01:38:01.473
<i>And she said, 'I hear
