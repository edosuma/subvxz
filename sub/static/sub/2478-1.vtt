WEBVTT

01:24.100 --> 01:25.867
Can't you sleep?

01:28.479 --> 01:31.832
It's past 1:00 in the morning, Dorothy.

01:32.650 --> 01:35.136
- Aunt Em?
- What, precious?

01:35.236 --> 01:39.256
I wish I could put my head on my paws
and go to sleep like Toto.

01:41.242 --> 01:43.343
Soon you will.

02:14.901 --> 02:19.222
I just can't see payin' out money
for this doctor when we don't have any.

02:19.322 --> 02:21.558
Garnet said she'd loan it to us.

02:21.658 --> 02:23.810
Garnet. That's charity, Em.

02:23.910 --> 02:27.387
She's my sister.
It's family, not charity.

02:28.373 --> 02:30.692
It's been six months since the tornado,

02:30.792 --> 02:32.861
and Dorothy hasn't been herself since.

02:32.961 --> 02:35.822
I'm takin' her to Cottonwood Falls
tomorrow and see if she can be helped.

02:35.922 --> 02:39.492
All she ever talks about
is someplace that just doesn't exist.

02:39.592 --> 02:43.737
Talkin' tin men, walkin' scarecrows,
ruby slippers.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.133
A shooting star, Toto.

02:56.776 --> 02:58.460
A shooting star.

03:20.466 --> 03:23.193
Toto, no! No, Toto!

03:27.140 --> 03:29.751
Did you lay an egg
this morning, Billina?

03:29.851 --> 03:31.326
Let's go see.

03:38.651 --> 03:40.502
Where's your egg, Billina?

03:45.908 --> 03:49.062
Billina, if you don't start
laying again,

03:49.162 --> 03:52.315
Aunt Em says she's gonna
stew you up for supper.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.448
It's a key, Toto.

04:25.740 --> 04:28.842
"O... Z."

04:32.205 --> 04:33.388
Oz.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.559
Aunt Em!

04:42.465 --> 04:45.150
Aunt Em, look! A key from Oz!

04:47.220 --> 04:49.831
It's just a key to the old house
before the tornado.

04:49.931 --> 04:53.042
- I must've turned it a thousand times.
- No, look, Aunt Em.

04:53.142 --> 04:56.077
It's proof. "O-Z." Oz.

04:56.979 --> 05:00.415
- Dorothy...
- My friends sent it on a shooting star.

05:00.817 --> 05:02.209
Remember how we spoke?

05:04.737 --> 05:06.713
Not to talk about Oz?

05:07.990 --> 05:09.508
Why?

05:11.327 --> 05:13.762
'Cause it's just my imagination.

05:16.165 --> 05:18.484
I know you don't want
to go to the doctor's.

05:18.584 --> 05:22.363
But you just haven't slept the night
right through since the tornado.

05:22.463 --> 05:24.940
And then, you're no help
to me in the morning.

05:26.968 --> 05:30.246
Aunt Em, my friends are in trouble.

05:30.346 --> 05:32.948
- I know it!
- We are in trouble, Dorothy.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.700
Lost the old house in the tornado.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.746
Never before had to have a mortgage,
now we may have to have two.

05:40.314 --> 05:43.959
Winter's comin' on.
New house isn't finished.

05:49.490 --> 05:51.258
He broke his leg, Aunt Em.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.774
Dorothy, that leg's mended. It's mended.

05:57.874 --> 06:01.810
Hurry up and get yourself ready.
We're going to be late.

06:11.053 --> 06:12.246
Bye, Uncle Henry!

06:12.346 --> 06:14.749
Y'all get yourselves back here by dark!

06:14.849 --> 06:16.116
We will!

06:17.143 --> 06:19.995
Come on, giddap! There you go.

06:41.751 --> 06:43.518
Go home, Toto.

06:44.086 --> 06:45.854
Toto, go home!

06:49.926 --> 06:51.318
Go home!

06:52.887 --> 06:54.946
Aunt Em, will he be all right?

06:55.431 --> 06:56.698
He will.

06:58.267 --> 06:59.993
Go home!

07:31.425 --> 07:32.734
Giddap.

07:39.475 --> 07:42.243
I've never been past Franklin before.

08:08.337 --> 08:12.533
The tin woodsman used to be made
of flesh, like everybody else,

08:12.633 --> 08:14.442
but then he cut off his leg.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.028
He had a tin leg made,

08:17.346 --> 08:19.707
but then a witch enchanted his ax,

08:19.807 --> 08:25.213
and he kept on cutting off the other parts
of his body, until he was all made of tin.

08:25.313 --> 08:28.716
- Even his head was...
- That's all right, Dorothy.

08:28.816 --> 08:31.626
You mentioned something about a tiger.

08:32.028 --> 08:34.764
A lion. A cowardly lion.

08:34.864 --> 08:39.299
And he could talk too,
like the scarecrow and the tin man?

08:39.702 --> 08:42.470
Yes, all the animals in Oz could talk.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.400
Just how did you get back from Oz?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.393
With my ruby slippers.

08:49.478 --> 08:50.979
And exactly...

08:51.631 --> 08:52.981
how did that work?

08:53.883 --> 08:57.944
You put them on
and you click the heels three times,

08:58.721 --> 09:01.489
and then you said,
"There's no place like home."

09:03.142 --> 09:06.244
Dorothy, where are those slippers now?

09:09.732 --> 09:10.957
Dorothy?

09:13.736 --> 09:14.961
I lost them.

09:16.072 --> 09:19.674
They fell off on the way back.

09:22.078 --> 09:28.442
Well, I think I know just the thing

09:28.542 --> 09:31.144
to cheer Dorothy up.

09:33.923 --> 09:40.162
This electrical marvel will make
it possible for you to sleep again.

09:40.262 --> 09:46.002
And it will also get rid of
all those bad waking dreams

09:46.102 --> 09:48.953
that you've been telling me about.

09:49.689 --> 09:52.633
Now, this fellow here has a face.

09:52.733 --> 09:55.177
Do you see it?

09:55.277 --> 09:58.671
Here are his eyes,
and this must be his nose,

09:59.782 --> 10:01.883
and this must be his mouth.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.053
But what's this? Dorothy?

10:07.623 --> 10:12.143
Why, it's his tongue!

10:12.461 --> 10:14.030
Isn't it?

10:14.130 --> 10:18.399
- Will it hurt?
- No, no!

10:18.801 --> 10:22.204
It just manages electrical current.

10:22.304 --> 10:26.709
Now, your aunt already knows
that we are at the dawn of a new age.

10:26.809 --> 10:30.546
In just two months,
it will be the year 1900.

10:30.646 --> 10:35.083
A new century. The 20th century.

10:35.818 --> 10:38.545
A century of electricity.

10:39.280 --> 10:43.508
The brain itself is an electrical machine.
It's nothing but a machine.

10:43.826 --> 10:48.346
When it malfunctions,
a blow to the head, for example,

10:48.497 --> 10:51.901
then the brain produces
useless excess currents.

10:52.001 --> 10:57.522
These excess currents
are our dreams and delusions.

10:58.799 --> 11:04.779
And we have found out that
sometimes the brain malfunctions.

11:05.347 --> 11:08.074
Just like the dreams
that you have, Dorothy.

11:08.934 --> 11:13.881
Now we have the means
to control these excess currents.

11:13.981 --> 11:15.206
Yes.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.626
Fine.

11:27.661 --> 11:29.939
I must get back to Henry
before nightfall.

11:30.039 --> 11:31.806
You understand, don't you?

11:33.626 --> 11:37.071
Here's your lunch pail. I was thinking
we'd only stay a short time.

11:37.171 --> 11:40.607
That won't be necessary.
We have excellent meals here.

11:42.802 --> 11:46.821
Now, be a good girl,

11:47.389 --> 11:51.242
and do everything the doctor
and the head nurse tell you,

11:51.727 --> 11:53.796
and I'll be back tomorrow

11:53.896 --> 11:56.331
and we'll go home!

11:57.691 --> 12:01.053
I've never left her
out of my sight among strangers.

12:01.153 --> 12:03.755
She's in good hands.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.560
Will you bring Toto
when you come to get me?

12:07.660 --> 12:12.764
I will. Yes, of course I will.

12:39.775 --> 12:42.001
You won't need that!

12:57.251 --> 13:00.321
You stay here until
we come and get you.

13:00.421 --> 13:04.732
You may have a nap if you wish.

13:10.973 --> 13:13.834
Come on, giddap!

13:13.934 --> 13:16.411
Come on!

13:27.156 --> 13:29.215
Aunt Em.

13:33.996 --> 13:36.180
This is for you.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.101
Thank you.

13:45.257 --> 13:48.526
- It's Halloween soon.
- I know.

13:50.679 --> 13:52.780
Why did they bring you here, Dorothy?

13:55.017 --> 13:58.286
Because I can't sleep.

14:01.023 --> 14:04.917
And I talk about a place that I've been to,
but nobody believes it exists.

14:12.534 --> 14:14.770
I have to go. I'll come back later.

15:49.256 --> 15:51.816
Would you like to go
for a ride, Dorothy?

16:11.487 --> 16:14.723
- Lie down.
- I'd like to sit up if I may.

16:14.823 --> 16:18.843
- What did your aunt tell you?
- To do what you told me, Miss Wilson.

16:20.162 --> 16:22.388
Then lie down.

16:28.504 --> 16:30.572
Why do you have to tie me down?

16:30.672 --> 16:32.908
So that you don't fall off.

16:33.008 --> 16:37.403
I came all the way from the farm
in the buggy and didn't fall off.

16:46.647 --> 16:49.624
- Did I hear somebody screaming there?
- No.

17:11.797 --> 17:15.117
Hello, Dorothy. How are you?

17:15.217 --> 17:17.453
I wish I wasn't tied down.

17:17.553 --> 17:19.737
Nothing to worry about.

17:20.638 --> 17:22.790
What are those?

17:22.891 --> 17:24.042
Oh.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.377
We'll just put them over your ears.

17:26.478 --> 17:31.967
Pretty soon they'll draw all those
unpleasant dreams out of your head.

17:32.067 --> 17:36.504
Then, when you wake up,
you'll never be bothered by them again.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.063
Testing. On.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.267
Off.

18:01.013 --> 18:07.159
Well, I think we're almost ready.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.218
- Ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

18:37.466 --> 18:39.650
Oh, dear.

18:40.552 --> 18:43.789
I'll see to that.
You check the generator.

19:18.090 --> 19:22.193
- Who's there?
- Quick! We have to get you out of here.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.748
What's that screaming?

19:26.848 --> 19:29.668
Patients who have been damaged,
locked in the cellar.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.285
Quick!

19:45.826 --> 19:47.968
Get back!

19:48.870 --> 19:50.554
In here, quick!

20:06.513 --> 20:08.322
So!

20:08.849 --> 20:10.658
Run, Dorothy, run!

20:14.021 --> 20:15.955
Come on!

20:23.155 --> 20:25.339
Faster, Dorothy! Faster!

20:42.975 --> 20:44.692
Stop!

20:45.761 --> 20:47.319
Stop!

20:52.267 --> 20:55.661
- Dorothy!
- Here, grab my hand!

21:00.233 --> 21:01.375
Dorothy!

21:02.110 --> 21:03.711
Jump!

21:10.619 --> 21:12.219
Stop!

21:16.625 --> 21:18.809
Here, Dorothy, here!

21:20.379 --> 21:22.563
Hold on!

22:43.795 --> 22:45.080
What's that?

22:45.180 --> 22:48.595
I was just tryin' to lay
my egg, that's all.

22:49.885 --> 22:51.318
Billina?

22:52.512 --> 22:54.414
Who else?

22:54.514 --> 22:57.709
What are you doing here?
Have you been here all night too?

22:59.561 --> 23:02.297
I've never been so wet in my whole life.

23:06.401 --> 23:08.595
How big is this pond anyway?

23:08.695 --> 23:11.130
I don't think it's a pond, Billina.

23:18.079 --> 23:21.515
- I guess it is a pond.
- Told you so.

23:24.711 --> 23:27.114
Where did all the rest of the water go?

23:27.214 --> 23:29.815
Where did Kansas go?

23:48.527 --> 23:51.596
This is some place for a chicken coop.

23:51.696 --> 23:57.009
When did you learn to talk? I thought
hens could only cluck and cackle.

23:58.286 --> 24:00.846
Strange, ain't it? How's my grammar?

24:00.956 --> 24:05.527
If we were in the Land of Oz,
your talking wouldn't be strange at all.

24:06.188 --> 24:08.520
There goes the water.

24:12.217 --> 24:14.818
High and dry.

24:17.472 --> 24:19.490
Oz.

24:26.648 --> 24:29.468
- Maybe this is Oz!
- Oz?

24:29.568 --> 24:34.890
Well, I think I'll have a look around and
see if I can find myself some breakfast.

24:34.990 --> 24:36.590
Wait!

24:37.659 --> 24:42.930
If this is the Land of Oz,
then this is the Deadly Desert.

24:44.833 --> 24:46.433
Deadly Desert?

24:48.003 --> 24:53.074
It surrounds Oz. Last time
I flew over it in the old house.

24:53.174 --> 24:57.412
Anything living that touches it
turns to sand.

24:57.512 --> 24:59.738
Just my luck.

25:00.849 --> 25:04.618
If we stay on these stones,
we'll be all right.

25:07.689 --> 25:09.915
Careful.

25:14.195 --> 25:16.130
Careful.

25:21.995 --> 25:24.138
One, two, three!

25:24.706 --> 25:26.932
There.

25:27.876 --> 25:32.239
- Now, let's find something for breakfast.
- It's about time.

25:32.339 --> 25:37.118
Then we can go on to the Emerald City
and see my friend the Scarecrow.

25:37.218 --> 25:40.487
- Scarecrow?
- He's the King of Oz, Billina.

25:47.354 --> 25:51.758
Look, Billina. It's a lunch pail tree.

25:51.858 --> 25:54.460
What happened to breakfast?

25:56.404 --> 25:58.797
Now I know we're in Oz.

26:01.326 --> 26:04.511
Now, make sure
you don't pick a green one.

26:05.747 --> 26:08.348
There's some ripe ones.

26:12.337 --> 26:16.607
This one for now,
and this other one for later.

26:19.761 --> 26:21.955
Come share my lunch with me, Billina.

26:22.055 --> 26:24.823
Just a minute.
Nice couple of worms here.

26:25.433 --> 26:28.035
I wonder what's inside.

26:38.113 --> 26:42.017
And a ham sandwich?

26:42.117 --> 26:44.436
I'm glad it's not fried chicken.

26:44.536 --> 26:47.105
Oh, Billina, we're back in Oz!

26:47.205 --> 26:52.059
Now I can show you all the people
and things that nobody would believe in.

26:55.380 --> 27:00.234
Your Majesty, she has returned to Oz.

27:00.802 --> 27:04.696
Good. Keep an eye on her.

27:07.267 --> 27:09.961
What's the matter? What is it?

27:10.061 --> 27:13.006
She has a chicken with her!

27:13.106 --> 27:15.332
A chicken!

27:18.153 --> 27:21.723
Where are all your friends?
Where is everybody?

27:21.823 --> 27:26.186
I don't know, Billina. Oz is pretty big.

27:26.286 --> 27:29.096
I don't like it. Makes me nervous.

27:55.356 --> 27:57.958
Billina, this is our old house!

27:58.526 --> 28:01.096
The one the tornado blew away!

28:01.196 --> 28:05.924
- This is how I got to Oz the first time.
- Looks like it was a rough trip.

28:15.293 --> 28:18.446
Billina, this used to be my bedroom.

28:18.546 --> 28:21.148
And in there was the kitchen.

28:25.220 --> 28:29.114
That's where we landed on
the Wicked Witch of the East.

28:30.183 --> 28:34.421
- Wicked Witch?
- But where are all the Munchkins?

28:34.521 --> 28:37.497
What are you on about, my dear?

28:40.026 --> 28:42.169
Oh, no.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.817
- Oh, no!
- It's just a yellow brick.

28:55.917 --> 28:58.945
No, Billina, you don't understand.

28:59.045 --> 29:02.490
This was the Yellow Brick Road.

29:02.590 --> 29:05.692
It leads to the Emerald City!

29:07.262 --> 29:09.446
Dorothy!

29:12.600 --> 29:14.785
Wait for me!

29:17.772 --> 29:20.675
Oh, no! What's happened?

29:35.248 --> 29:36.649
Your Majesty,

29:36.749 --> 29:40.195
they have discovered
the Yellow Brick Road

29:40.295 --> 29:43.907
and are on their way
to the Emerald City.

29:44.007 --> 29:48.276
Good. They won't get past Mombi.

30:11.242 --> 30:15.512
Well, Billina,
that was the Emerald City.

30:39.729 --> 30:44.875
- Not moving very fast, are they?
- They've all been turned to stone.

30:45.526 --> 30:48.670
All this way to see a bunch of stiffs.

30:54.661 --> 30:58.930
- What's a Wheeler?
- I don't remember them.

31:24.941 --> 31:27.427
Look, these ones have lost their heads.

31:27.527 --> 31:31.922
That's what I call
just plain carelessness.

31:37.236 --> 31:38.720
Billina!

31:41.249 --> 31:43.475
Dorothy, look out!

31:44.127 --> 31:45.602
It's the Tin Woodsman.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.188
Oh, Tin Woodsman, what happened to you?

31:50.133 --> 31:51.983
What's happened to everybody?

31:56.347 --> 31:58.073
Oh, Cowardly Lion!

32:01.185 --> 32:03.328
Oh, Cowardly Lion,

32:03.563 --> 32:06.174
what's happened to you?

32:10.111 --> 32:12.963
Come here, chicken!

32:13.364 --> 32:15.590
A Wheeler!

32:20.413 --> 32:22.681
Billina! Billina!

32:26.919 --> 32:29.104
Over here, Dorothy!

32:36.220 --> 32:37.988
Quick! That way!

32:55.907 --> 32:59.092
We've got you. You're trapped!

33:05.708 --> 33:07.267
Chicken!

33:18.304 --> 33:20.488
The key!

33:28.523 --> 33:30.207
Get her!

33:37.949 --> 33:40.560
You have to come out sooner or later.

33:40.660 --> 33:43.646
When you do,
we'll tear you into little pieces

33:43.746 --> 33:45.722
and throw you in the Deadly Desert!

33:46.332 --> 33:48.443
I haven't done anything to you!

33:48.543 --> 33:51.895
Isn't that a stolen lunch pail
in your hand?

33:52.588 --> 33:55.742
Isn't that a chicken in there with you?

33:55.842 --> 33:57.243
Chicken!

33:57.343 --> 34:02.123
The Nome King doesn't allow chickens
anywhere in Oz!

34:02.223 --> 34:05.700
- Who's the Nome King?
- "Who is the Nome King?"

34:08.271 --> 34:10.465
"Who is the Nome King?"

34:15.570 --> 34:19.422
Well, what are we going
to do now, Dorothy?

34:23.202 --> 34:25.594
What is it?

34:28.373 --> 34:30.558
I don't know.

34:45.141 --> 34:48.210
"The Royal Army of Oz."

34:48.311 --> 34:51.880
Army? It's just a bunch of old junk,

34:51.981 --> 34:55.250
like the copper kettle
in the yard back home.

35:00.323 --> 35:03.133
Look! Billina, some directions.

35:14.503 --> 35:18.356
"For thinking,
wind number one under left arm.

35:20.426 --> 35:23.236
"For speaking,
wind number two under right arm.

35:24.388 --> 35:29.377
"For walking and action,
wind number three, middle of back.

35:29.477 --> 35:35.540
"Guaranteed to work perfectly
for 1,000 years."

35:35.858 --> 35:37.584
You don't believe that, do you?

35:37.985 --> 35:40.920
I don't know.
I'll wind him up and we'll see.

35:41.822 --> 35:44.299
I'll wind up his thinking first.

35:54.710 --> 35:57.312
I wonder what he's thinkin' about.

35:58.923 --> 36:02.567
I'll wind up his speech,
and maybe he can tell us.

36:06.973 --> 36:11.085
Maybe he can tell us
what happened to the Emerald City.

36:14.647 --> 36:18.291
- Good morning, little girl.
- Good morning, sir.

36:18.985 --> 36:22.420
Are you Dorothy Gale?

36:23.197 --> 36:25.183
- Yes, sir.
- Pleased to meet you.

36:25.283 --> 36:28.477
I am Tik-Tok, the Royal Army of Oz.

36:28.577 --> 36:32.815
His Majesty, the Scarecrow, locked me
in here and told me to wait for you.

36:32.915 --> 36:36.110
What happened to the Emerald City?
Where is the Scarecrow?

36:36.210 --> 36:40.948
I do not know. Suddenly everything
living began to turn to stone.

36:41.048 --> 36:45.870
When you did not arrive,
I called for help until my voice ran down.

36:45.970 --> 36:49.624
Then I paced back and forth
until my action ran down.

36:49.724 --> 36:53.461
Then I stood and thought
until my thought ran down.

36:53.561 --> 36:59.300
After that, I remember nothing
until you wound me up. Thank you.

36:59.400 --> 37:03.137
You're welcome.
It was Billina who found the key.

37:03.237 --> 37:06.464
- Billina?
- Over here.

37:07.158 --> 37:11.103
Good morning, Mrs. Hen. Where
did you find the key for this place?

37:11.203 --> 37:14.649
- Over near the hog trough.
- Hog trough?

37:14.749 --> 37:17.860
- In Kansas.
- Kansas?

37:17.960 --> 37:20.988
The Scarecrow must have
sent it to you somehow.

37:21.088 --> 37:25.743
If you don't mind, Mr. Tok,
I'll wind up your action.

37:25.843 --> 37:31.749
That would please me very much.
And you may call me Tik-Tok.

37:31.849 --> 37:35.086
Why weren't you turned to stone
just like everybody else?

37:35.186 --> 37:39.465
Because I am not alive
and never will be, thank goodness.

37:40.733 --> 37:45.179
Well, Tik-Tok, the first thing we have
to do is to escape from the Wheelers.

37:45.279 --> 37:49.558
They're outside, and said they're going
to throw us into the Deadly Desert.

37:49.658 --> 37:53.428
From now on, I will be
your obedient servant.

37:55.581 --> 37:57.566
If you keep me wound up.

37:57.666 --> 38:03.229
Make sure my think-works are
extra tight, and I will formulate a plan.

38:19.438 --> 38:21.623
Lunch pail.

38:23.025 --> 38:26.252
These Wheelers can be tricky customers.

38:57.518 --> 39:00.537
Oh, my goodness.

39:16.954 --> 39:20.890
You run up the stairs.
I will take care of them.

39:38.934 --> 39:40.493
Come here!

39:47.234 --> 39:51.421
You'll be sorry for treating me like this!
I'm a terrible person!

39:52.406 --> 39:58.229
I am only a machine, so I cannot be sorry
or happy, no matter what happens.

39:58.329 --> 40:02.316
Where's the Scarecrow?
What's happened to the Emerald City?

40:02.416 --> 40:04.819
Answer her!

40:04.919 --> 40:08.614
- Answer her!
- The Nome King!

40:08.714 --> 40:11.742
He conquered the Emerald City.
He took all the emeralds.

40:11.842 --> 40:15.653
- He turned everyone to stone.
- What about the Scarecrow?

40:20.059 --> 40:23.546
There's only one person
that knows where the Scarecrow is.

40:23.646 --> 40:28.666
And that's Princess M... M... Mom...

40:29.235 --> 40:32.263
- Princess Mombi!
- Princess Mombi?

40:32.363 --> 40:35.891
- I don't remember her.
- Take us to Mombi.

40:35.991 --> 40:39.177
No! No! No!

40:42.331 --> 40:46.694
Please, let me go.
Please! Please let me go.

40:46.794 --> 40:50.030
Please let me go! Let me go!

40:50.130 --> 40:53.242
- All right, Tik-Tok. Let him go.
- Behave yourself, now.

40:53.342 --> 40:56.569
I will behave. I'll behave!

40:59.098 --> 41:00.541
Behave!

41:05.854 --> 41:08.039
I'll be...

41:11.443 --> 41:13.628
You behave!

41:17.199 --> 41:19.384
Hello?

41:25.249 --> 41:27.433
What a mess!

41:29.378 --> 41:31.562
Come on, Tik-Tok.

41:38.596 --> 41:41.823
This Mombi is some housekeeper.

41:50.691 --> 41:53.543
I think it is up these stairs, Dorothy.

42:44.536 --> 42:49.223
Excuse me, miss,
but are you Princess Mombi?

42:51.293 --> 42:53.478
Help me to rise.

43:06.642 --> 43:10.244
I think I'll put on
something more appropriate.

43:10.521 --> 43:14.665
Come with me.
Your friends can stay here.

43:15.693 --> 43:18.878
We're really looking for the Scarecrow.

43:52.896 --> 43:56.249
I think number four will do
for this afternoon.

44:26.930 --> 44:29.500
What do you think?

44:29.600 --> 44:33.369
I think you're very beautiful.

44:33.479 --> 44:36.090
I should hope so.

44:36.190 --> 44:40.719
And just who might you be?
What are you doing here?

44:40.819 --> 44:43.087
I'm Dorothy Gale.

44:44.573 --> 44:46.225
Dorothy Gale?

44:46.325 --> 44:48.811
What's happened to the Scarecrow?

44:48.911 --> 44:50.887
Come nearer to me.

44:54.333 --> 44:59.279
The Nome King took the Scarecrow and
all the emeralds back to his mountain.

44:59.379 --> 45:01.814
And turned everyone else to stone.

45:03.300 --> 45:08.414
You will be rather attractive one day.

45:08.514 --> 45:10.999
Not at all beautiful, you understand,

45:11.099 --> 45:13.961
but you have a certain prettiness.

45:14.061 --> 45:17.496
Different from my other heads.

45:18.273 --> 45:22.845
I believe I'll lock you in the tower
for a few years till your head is ready.

45:22.945 --> 45:26.422
- And then I'll take it.
- I believe you will not!

45:27.074 --> 45:28.883
Tik-Tok!

45:30.494 --> 45:32.354
Billina!

45:32.454 --> 45:34.722
I am coming, Dorothy.

45:35.916 --> 45:38.902
Do not worry. I will save you.

45:39.002 --> 45:42.188
You, I'll have fried for breakfast!

45:43.173 --> 45:45.358
- Tik-Tok, help me!
- Stop!

45:47.636 --> 45:51.614
Oh, dear. My action has run down.

45:53.475 --> 45:54.835
This is too bad.

45:54.935 --> 45:58.756
My fight with the Wheelers
made me run down faster than usual.

45:58.856 --> 46:02.083
It can't be helped, Tik-Tok.

46:04.528 --> 46:06.096
What will you do with Tik-Tok?

46:06.196 --> 46:08.631
People will think I have a new statue.

46:20.168 --> 46:21.310
Ha.

46:54.661 --> 46:57.731
The Nome King's mountain.

46:57.831 --> 47:03.144
If this is Oz, Dorothy, I'd rather
take my chances back in Kansas.

47:05.547 --> 47:08.742
- Billina...
- What?

47:08.842 --> 47:14.697
- If only we could just fly away, like you.
- Only in my younger days, my dear.

47:47.089 --> 47:49.315
Mom?

47:50.050 --> 47:52.193
Mom?

47:54.221 --> 47:56.572
Mom, is that you?

47:59.768 --> 48:02.296
No.

48:02.396 --> 48:04.673
- I'm Dorothy Gale.
- Oh.

48:04.773 --> 48:08.802
For a second there,
I thought my mom had come back.

48:08.902 --> 48:12.306
What is this, a man or a melon?

48:12.406 --> 48:15.976
A pumpkin, if you please.
My name's Jack.

48:16.076 --> 48:18.979
Jack Pumpkinhead.

48:19.079 --> 48:21.315
May I ask a favor of you, Dorothy?

48:21.415 --> 48:24.850
Would you please check my head
for signs of spoiling?

48:31.133 --> 48:33.192
Any soft spots?

48:37.681 --> 48:40.375
- How does it feel?
- Very nice, sir.

48:40.475 --> 48:43.837
Thank you.
I've been alive such a short while,

48:43.937 --> 48:47.925
and I'm afraid of spoiling
before I've seen anything of the world.

48:48.025 --> 48:51.877
Could you put some of the rest of me
together again?

48:53.179 --> 48:55.849
If you can just tie that arm on.

48:55.949 --> 49:00.052
And then, my other leg
has fallen off too.

49:04.624 --> 49:06.693
Are you sure you're not my mom?

49:06.793 --> 49:09.061
I'm sure, Jack.

49:10.005 --> 49:14.618
Well, my mother built me to scare
that awful witch, Mombi.

49:14.718 --> 49:19.572
She stood me in a place where
Mombi would meet me, face-to-face.

49:19.723 --> 49:23.742
And along she came.
Sure enough, she was scared.

49:23.977 --> 49:28.256
But then, she was angry.
She has a terrible temper.

49:28.356 --> 49:30.550
I know.

49:30.650 --> 49:34.137
Where did she get
all those different heads?

49:34.237 --> 49:37.339
Did you see the headless
dancing girls outside?

49:38.624 --> 49:40.727
Well, that's where she got them.

49:40.827 --> 49:44.731
Anyway, Mombi was about
to destroy me with her stick.

49:44.831 --> 49:49.935
But she decided to test some powder
of life she'd just bought from a magician.

49:51.755 --> 49:54.074
She did.

49:54.174 --> 49:56.952
It worked.

49:57.052 --> 49:59.278
Here I am!

50:00.347 --> 50:03.083
Powder of life?

50:03.183 --> 50:07.671
You sprinkle it on something
and the thing comes to life.

50:07.771 --> 50:09.840
Does Mombi have any more of it?

50:09.940 --> 50:15.044
If she does, it's in cabinet 31,
with her original head.

50:17.239 --> 50:19.516
What happened to your mother?

50:19.616 --> 50:22.352
She vanished. Mombi enchanted her.

50:22.452 --> 50:25.439
After that, she threw me in this corner

50:25.539 --> 50:27.941
and said she was gonna make
a pie out of me.

50:28.041 --> 50:30.318
But she was wearing head 22 at the time

50:30.418 --> 50:31.987
and must not have worn it since,

50:32.087 --> 50:33.947
because she hasn't remembered
I'm up here.

50:34.047 --> 50:36.398
Jack, Billina, listen!

50:36.716 --> 50:38.400
Here's what we have to do.

50:53.108 --> 50:54.917
Oh!

50:57.988 --> 51:00.679
Is that Tik-Tok?

51:21.928 --> 51:23.529
Dorothy?

51:24.139 --> 51:25.281
Sh.

51:26.099 --> 51:27.199
Oh.

51:27.475 --> 51:32.371
Dorothy, may I call you Mom,
even if it isn't so?

51:34.608 --> 51:36.009
Oh!

51:36.109 --> 51:37.876
Thank you.

51:42.282 --> 51:45.852
Tik-Tok, are you listening?

51:45.952 --> 51:48.355
Don't say anything.

51:48.455 --> 51:50.472
This is Jack.

51:58.632 --> 52:00.534
After I'm finished winding you up,

52:00.634 --> 52:04.871
go upstairs with him
and we'll explain what you have to do.

52:08.642 --> 52:15.331
- Did you understand all that, Tik-Tok?
- I understand it better than you do.

52:47.514 --> 52:51.550
- Good. Go and get the head, Jack.
- Yes, sir!

52:51.660 --> 52:53.952
Billina, where's that cord?

52:56.798 --> 52:59.613
Over here, Billina.

53:00.777 --> 53:03.138
That's it.

53:04.576 --> 53:05.765
What's that?

53:05.865 --> 53:08.467
The head of a Gump.

53:46.906 --> 53:48.850
Here's a broom, Tik-Tok.

53:48.950 --> 53:51.853
It'll make a great tail.

53:51.953 --> 53:54.856
Excellent. Now we must Gump the head
in the front

53:54.956 --> 53:56.983
and tie Jack's feet together.

53:57.083 --> 54:00.352
Right. Tie my feet together.

54:00.462 --> 54:03.730
Bring that mantelpiece to the desk,
and anoint the palms!

54:04.007 --> 54:06.775
Right. Anoint the palm!

54:08.011 --> 54:10.330
That is right, Jack. Left, right, wrong.

54:10.430 --> 54:12.207
What are you talking about?

54:12.307 --> 54:16.002
Little girls, pumpkinheads
make chicken fly the coop.

54:16.102 --> 54:17.244
Coop?

55:16.830 --> 55:19.932
Dorothy Gale!

55:23.920 --> 55:26.104
Dorothy Gale!

55:29.926 --> 55:33.195
Dorothy Gale!

56:03.710 --> 56:07.271
Where's my powder of life?

56:12.594 --> 56:15.237
- Mombi's awake!
- Oh, no!

56:15.763 --> 56:18.824
- It's not finished!
- Tik-Tok went berserk!

56:19.017 --> 56:22.536
- Tickle, tickle me!
- His brain's ran down.

56:22.896 --> 56:26.248
If his brain's ran down,
how could he talk?

56:26.566 --> 56:28.968
It happens to people all the time, Jack.

56:29.068 --> 56:32.389
Tie the palm leaves to the sofa, quick!
Billina, help him!

56:32.489 --> 56:35.350
- We need another cord!
- Well, hurry!

56:35.450 --> 56:38.103
Thank goodness, Dorothy.
I am all right now.

56:38.203 --> 56:40.313
Go to the door and look out for Mombi.

56:40.413 --> 56:42.431
All right, Dorothy.

56:46.085 --> 56:49.605
Make sure you do the head,
so it can see where it's going.

56:57.847 --> 57:01.376
- It's not working!
- There must've been some magic words.

57:01.476 --> 57:04.421
- What were they? Think!
- Think?

57:04.521 --> 57:05.547
You've got to remember!

57:05.647 --> 57:08.675
I wasn't alive then.
How can I remember?

57:08.775 --> 57:12.044
Read the directions, Dorothy!

57:12.153 --> 57:15.265
- I don't know these words!
- Read them anyway.

57:15.365 --> 57:17.549
"Weaugh, teaugh,

57:18.034 --> 57:19.593
"peaugh."

57:19.994 --> 57:22.220
- Peaugh?
- That's it!

57:23.915 --> 57:26.224
Hurry!

57:27.377 --> 57:29.320
I'll stop you!

57:29.420 --> 57:31.614
She is coming!

57:31.714 --> 57:34.200
Jack, go help Tik-Tok get aboard.
Billina, get in!

57:34.300 --> 57:35.952
- Wait for me!
- A chicken?

57:36.052 --> 57:39.289
- Can you flap your wings?
- I don't have any wings.

57:39.389 --> 57:42.375
- Now you do!
- I guess you're right, I do!

57:42.475 --> 57:45.378
- Jump up, Tik-Tok!
- Help me up, Dorothy!

57:45.478 --> 57:50.082
- Easy, is it?
- Dorothy Gale!

57:51.234 --> 57:52.927
So!

57:53.027 --> 57:55.796
- Fly, fly!
- Wait for me.

57:56.906 --> 57:59.049
Jack! Jack!

57:59.951 --> 58:01.551
Stop!

58:09.043 --> 58:11.353
Fly! Fly!

58:17.093 --> 58:19.027
We did it!

58:27.729 --> 58:31.206
- Help me!
- Hold on, Jack!

58:31.733 --> 58:34.469
Here, Jack, give me your hand.

58:34.569 --> 58:36.586
Tik-Tok, will you help me pull?

58:37.530 --> 58:40.725
Wake up! Wake up, all of you! Get up!

58:40.825 --> 58:43.895
Get up! Wake up! Look!

58:43.995 --> 58:46.898
Dorothy Gale is escaping!

58:46.998 --> 58:49.526
Go and get them back for me! Hurry up!

58:49.626 --> 58:52.237
All of you! Go on!

58:52.337 --> 58:55.856
And make sure
you bring back that chicken!

58:57.216 --> 59:00.527
Don't come back without them!

59:05.391 --> 59:08.628
The last thing I remember
is walking through the forest

59:08.728 --> 59:11.204
and hearing a loud noise.

59:12.106 --> 59:15.843
And now, here I am,
flying through the air.

59:15.943 --> 59:18.638
What am I anyway?

59:18.738 --> 59:21.432
You're just a thing

59:21.532 --> 59:23.434
with a Gump's head on it.

59:23.534 --> 59:25.645
We built you and brought you to life

59:25.745 --> 59:29.315
so that you could take us to
the Nome King to rescue the Scarecrow.

59:29.415 --> 59:33.736
I may not last very long.
I don't feel too well put together.

59:33.836 --> 59:35.863
Oh, don't say that.

59:35.963 --> 59:40.410
How do we know where to land?
It's awful dark down there.

59:40.510 --> 59:43.195
The Nome King's mountain
was straight ahead.

59:44.389 --> 59:46.364
I think.

59:47.767 --> 59:50.878
The best thing to do is
to keep flying until dawn.

59:50.978 --> 59:54.048
Then maybe we can find
a safe place to land.

59:54.148 --> 59:56.050
Good idea, Tik-Tok.

59:56.150 --> 59:59.662
Mr. Gump? Can you just
keep flying straight ahead?

59:59.762 --> 01:00:02.380
I don't think
I could turn if I wanted to.

01:00:03.908 --> 01:00:07.385
Why don't we just fly back to Kansas?

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.058
Whatever happens,

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:17.020
I'm awfully sleepy right now.

01:00:18.798 --> 01:00:22.943
And I'm just glad I have
my own head to be sleepy with.

01:00:28.299 --> 01:00:30.116
Good night, Mom.

01:00:32.687 --> 01:00:35.206
Good night, Jack.

01:00:55.126 --> 01:00:56.685
Ozma.

01:00:57.795 --> 01:01:00.657
Nobody's going to help you.

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:03.275
Nobody knows where you are.

01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:09.447
There's nobody left
who even knows who you are.

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:29.634
- What are they?
- Wheelers.

01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:36.859
Mr. Gump, can't you fly any faster?

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:39.728
Not unless one of you wants to jump off.

01:01:40.004 --> 01:01:41.146
Oh.

01:01:41.881 --> 01:01:44.649
Tik-Tok, you're the heaviest.

01:01:44.842 --> 01:01:45.910
Hmph!

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:10.685
Deadly Desert.

01:02:10.785 --> 01:02:12.928
Deadly Desert!

01:02:20.253 --> 01:02:23.313
We are over the Deadly Desert, Jack.

01:02:50.825 --> 01:02:53.352
Mom! Wake up!

01:02:53.452 --> 01:02:55.354
What's happening?

01:02:55.454 --> 01:02:58.733
- The ropes are breaking.
- Oh, no!

01:02:58.833 --> 01:03:01.810
I knew it! We're gonna fall apart.

01:03:03.254 --> 01:03:05.865
Are we gonna land now, Mom?

01:03:05.965 --> 01:03:08.900
Other side. The rope on the other side.

01:03:11.552 --> 01:03:13.164
I'll get it!

01:03:13.264 --> 01:03:15.198
Help!

01:03:16.767 --> 01:03:19.879
- Help me, Mom!
- Oh, Jack!

01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:21.579
Hurry!

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:25.760
Fly down.
Jack's lost his head over the side.

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.679
- We'll save you, Jack!
- I wasn't made to make turns.

01:03:28.779 --> 01:03:31.140
- Try! You've got to try!
- Well, all right.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.592
Hold on, I'm not sure
I know how to do this.

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:44.269
- Hold on, Tik-Tok!
- I am, Dorothy.

01:03:46.601 --> 01:03:48.115
Hold on, Dorothy.

01:03:56.724 --> 01:03:58.334
Can you hear me, Jack?

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:00.837
I feel

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:04.205
awfully dizzy!

01:04:06.067 --> 01:04:09.919
- Thanks, Mom.
- Somebody help me!

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.380
I'll save you.

01:04:17.578 --> 01:04:19.095
Abandon ship!

01:04:19.246 --> 01:04:22.682
If I had a stomach, I know I'd be sick.

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:35.288
I'm sorry, Mom!

01:04:35.388 --> 01:04:37.331
It's all right, Jack!

01:04:37.431 --> 01:04:39.532
It can't be helped now!

01:04:56.356 --> 01:04:58.436
That was a novel experience, wasn't it?

01:04:58.536 --> 01:05:00.938
- Pick me up!
- Tik-Tok!

01:05:01.038 --> 01:05:04.233
Pick me up. Pick me up.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:07.737
Pick me up. Pick me up.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:10.156
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.

01:05:10.256 --> 01:05:12.158
Jack, are you all right?

01:05:12.258 --> 01:05:16.120
Why are all of you
standing on your heads?

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.071
Where are we, anyway?

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.099
The Nome King's mountain.

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:39.008
The Nome King.

01:05:44.457 --> 01:05:46.683
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:52.689
Tik-Tok, you've got to be more careful.

01:05:57.928 --> 01:06:01.832
Yes, Your Majesty? You called?

01:06:01.932 --> 01:06:05.118
What is that noise going on up there?

01:06:09.607 --> 01:06:11.509
I don't know, Your Majesty.

01:06:11.609 --> 01:06:14.002
Well, find out!

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.473
What about the Gump? He's all in pieces.

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.475
And good riddance.

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:22.218
I'm much happier just being a head.

01:06:23.496 --> 01:06:27.441
We should tie him back on the sofa.
Then, at least, he could walk.

01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:29.434
Oh, no!

01:06:30.002 --> 01:06:33.781
Every head must have a body
if it expects to get around.

01:06:33.881 --> 01:06:37.326
Doesn't look like there's much
of anyplace to get around to.

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:42.665
She escaped from Mombi somehow
and crossed the Deadly Desert.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:47.869
Now she is on our mountain
with a small army.

01:06:48.187 --> 01:06:51.465
She is more powerful than I thought.

01:06:51.565 --> 01:06:53.666
What about the chicken?

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:59.088
There's no sign of the chicken.

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:04.645
This is terrible.
Suppose I meet another Gump.

01:07:04.745 --> 01:07:08.149
I'd die a second time, of embarrassment.

01:07:08.249 --> 01:07:12.602
I don't think you'll have to worry about
meeting any other Gumps up here.

01:07:14.213 --> 01:07:16.323
Tell me who you are,

01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:20.786
and why you have come
all the way to my kingdom

01:07:20.886 --> 01:07:23.205
and what I can do to make you happy.

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:26.751
- It must be the Nome King.
- Where is he? I don't see anybody.

01:07:26.851 --> 01:07:30.212
My name is Dorothy Gale, Your Majesty.

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:34.383
And these are my friends,
Tik-Tok, Jack and the Gump.

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:40.255
Not the Dorothy Gale from Kansas?

01:07:40.865 --> 01:07:42.767
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:07:42.867 --> 01:07:47.396
We've come to ask you to release the
Scarecrow and restore the Emerald City.

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:51.192
You believe that I have
stolen something, Dorothy,

01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:53.393
and you want me to give it back?

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:55.937
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:07:56.422 --> 01:08:01.442
If someone steals something,
you think they should give it back?

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:04.789
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:08:04.889 --> 01:08:08.283
And what if they don't
want to give it back?

01:08:09.894 --> 01:08:11.452
Well,

01:08:14.773 --> 01:08:18.551
then we are here
with our army to conquer you

01:08:18.652 --> 01:08:20.920
and force you to give it back.

01:08:21.906 --> 01:08:24.340
Army?

01:08:30.288 --> 01:08:32.399
Mom, why is he laughing?

01:08:43.434 --> 01:08:44.902
Army!

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.209
An army!

01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:53.243
- Look out!
- I am! I am!

01:08:56.718 --> 01:09:00.251
- Dorothy!
- Mom!

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:05.933
All the precious stones in the world

01:09:06.033 --> 01:09:08.685
are made here

01:09:08.786 --> 01:09:13.598
in my underground dominions.

01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:17.736
All made for me

01:09:17.836 --> 01:09:20.854
by my Nomes.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.785
So, imagine how we feel

01:09:24.885 --> 01:09:27.705
when someone from the world above

01:09:27.805 --> 01:09:32.075
digs down and steals my treasures.

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:36.546
All those emeralds in the Emerald City

01:09:36.647 --> 01:09:40.207
really belong to me.

01:09:40.984 --> 01:09:46.631
I was just taking back
what was mine to begin with.

01:09:46.907 --> 01:09:49.977
- You have so much!
- Beg your pardon?

01:09:50.077 --> 01:09:52.188
You have so much!

01:09:52.287 --> 01:09:54.639
That is not the point.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.487
I am not the thief.

01:10:00.587 --> 01:10:02.489
- Dorothy!
- Scarecrow!

01:10:05.259 --> 01:10:08.111
Your friend is the thief.

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:14.835
What's happened to the Scarecrow?

01:10:14.935 --> 01:10:19.590
Oh, I transformed him into an ornament.

01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:25.221
Into an amusing and beautiful ornament
for my palace.

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:29.183
I had been planning
to do it for some time,

01:10:29.283 --> 01:10:32.051
and your coming here

01:10:32.411 --> 01:10:34.637
reminded me.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.640
Thank you.

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:45.064
He never stole anything!
They were there when he came!

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:03.916
He never stole the emeralds.
They were there when he came.

01:11:08.519 --> 01:11:10.006
He...

01:11:12.117 --> 01:11:16.837
The emeralds... He never stole.

01:11:24.838 --> 01:11:28.983
No, no. Don't cry.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:34.530
Poor, poor Dorothy Gale from Kansas.

01:11:35.641 --> 01:11:39.545
I didn't realize
he meant so much to you.

01:11:39.645 --> 01:11:43.507
He didn't steal the emeralds. They
were there when he became king.

01:11:43.607 --> 01:11:47.553
All's not lost, Dorothy.

01:11:47.653 --> 01:11:51.307
I know just the thing to cheer you up.

01:11:56.286 --> 01:11:59.722
You and your friends
can play a little game,

01:11:59.957 --> 01:12:03.736
and I bet that you get
the Scarecrow back after all.

01:12:03.836 --> 01:12:09.106
You'd risk something for that,
wouldn't you?

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:21.920
All right, then, where's Dorothy?
Where's the chicken?

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:26.592
- They escaped.
- They went that way.

01:12:26.692 --> 01:12:29.178
She went into the Nome King's mountain!

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.555
We have to warn him about that chicken!

01:12:31.655 --> 01:12:34.590
Take me to the Nome King,
you stupid idiots.

01:12:36.869 --> 01:12:40.522
You can go and inspect
my ornament collection.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:43.776
Each of you has three chances

01:12:43.876 --> 01:12:47.780
to guess which one is the Scarecrow.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.115
If you touch the right object

01:12:50.215 --> 01:12:55.037
and say the word "Oz" at the same time,

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:57.414
the Scarecrow will be restored

01:12:57.514 --> 01:13:01.075
and you may leave the palace.

01:13:02.352 --> 01:13:04.954
Sound fair enough?

01:13:07.232 --> 01:13:11.887
What else can we do?
He's a very powerful magician.

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:14.505
We're lucky
he hasn't turned us to stone.

01:13:23.081 --> 01:13:24.983
All right, we accept.

01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:27.268
Oh, good!

01:13:41.058 --> 01:13:43.669
Why doesn't the sofa go first?

01:13:43.769 --> 01:13:45.921
But I don't have anything to touch with.

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:48.173
You can use your antlers.

01:13:50.567 --> 01:13:53.044
I should've quit when I was ahead.

01:13:58.283 --> 01:14:00.301
Good luck, Mr. Gump.

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:10.320
Shall we have some refreshment

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.189
while we wait?

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:27.578
- How is it?
- Good.

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:32.968
What is it?

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:35.087
Limestone pie

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.256
and hot melted silver.

01:14:40.158 --> 01:14:42.259
Melted silver?

01:14:53.130 --> 01:14:55.741
The King mentioned a risk.

01:14:55.841 --> 01:14:58.325
What is it that we are risking?

01:15:09.021 --> 01:15:11.288
What was that?

01:15:12.024 --> 01:15:14.458
Next.

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:18.430
- Pick me up.
- I'm coming, Tik-Tok.

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:21.632
Pick me up. Pick me up.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.219
- Thank you.
- Where's the Gump?

01:15:25.329 --> 01:15:28.565
- He's turned into an ornament.
- What do you mean?

01:15:28.665 --> 01:15:30.891
An ornament. A knickknack.

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:34.863
He failed to guess correctly,

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:38.450
and so now he's become
part of my collection.

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:41.318
- Oh, no!
- But that's not fair!

01:15:43.388 --> 01:15:46.291
You said you were willing
to take a risk.

01:15:46.391 --> 01:15:49.127
It sounds fair to me,

01:15:49.227 --> 01:15:52.297
and what I think is all that matters.

01:15:52.397 --> 01:15:54.466
But you didn't tell us about it.

01:15:54.566 --> 01:15:56.593
Well, you didn't ask.

01:15:56.693 --> 01:16:00.296
Perhaps you'd like to visit
my fiery furnace!

01:16:05.744 --> 01:16:07.470
Next!

01:16:08.246 --> 01:16:10.306
- Pumpkinhead.
- Me?

01:16:23.095 --> 01:16:26.623
Being an ornament will probably be
hardest on you, Dorothy,

01:16:26.723 --> 01:16:31.003
since you're used to eating and
sleeping and other such activities.

01:16:31.103 --> 01:16:35.090
Since I never eat or sleep,
I won't miss them.

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:39.136
Don't talk that way, Jack.
We won't become ornaments.

01:16:39.236 --> 01:16:41.346
Tik-Tok's not even alive.

01:16:41.446 --> 01:16:44.340
I have always valued my lifelessness.

01:16:49.287 --> 01:16:51.347
Be careful, Jack.

01:17:00.257 --> 01:17:02.826
You too, Billina.

01:17:03.326 --> 01:17:05.937
We're a long way from Kansas, Dorothy.

01:17:11.143 --> 01:17:14.912
Faster! Faster!

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:17.799
Faster! Faster, faster!

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:20.385
You hear me? Faster! Faster!

01:17:20.485 --> 01:17:23.555
You miserable, slow wretches!

01:17:23.655 --> 01:17:27.059
I do not hold out much hope for Jack.

01:17:27.159 --> 01:17:29.561
He has many excellent qualities,

01:17:29.661 --> 01:17:32.648
but thinking is not one of them.

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:35.850
Maybe he'll be lucky.

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:43.357
Two guesses left.

01:17:46.511 --> 01:17:50.865
- You need winding?
- My think-works could be tighter.

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:57.172
It's too bad they didn't make you

01:17:57.272 --> 01:18:00.040
so you could wind yourself up.

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:04.721
Half the trouble you get into
comes from winding down.

01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:10.301
Faster! Faster!

01:18:12.537 --> 01:18:14.597
Faster!

01:18:23.548 --> 01:18:27.401
Next, the Army of Oz!

01:18:30.514 --> 01:18:35.326
Do not worry, Dorothy.
I am going to guess correctly.

01:18:57.249 --> 01:18:59.308
Why did you come here?

01:19:01.044 --> 01:19:03.145
I told you why.

01:19:04.422 --> 01:19:08.025
You came all this way for a scarecrow?

01:19:16.268 --> 01:19:21.256
Are you sure you didn't
come back for these?

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:23.675
- My ruby slippers!
- No. No.

01:19:23.775 --> 01:19:28.138
No. My ruby slippers.

01:19:28.238 --> 01:19:31.516
They just fell out of the sky one day.

01:19:31.616 --> 01:19:34.718
You were so anxious to get home.

01:19:37.789 --> 01:19:40.057
They're very powerful.

01:19:41.751 --> 01:19:45.729
They made it possible for me
to conquer the Emerald City.

01:19:51.636 --> 01:19:54.071
Thank you.

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:58.877
The Army of Oz has stopped guessing

01:19:58.977 --> 01:20:02.214
and is standing perfectly still
in the middle of the room.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.552
Your army

01:20:07.652 --> 01:20:11.556
has stopped guessing
and is standing perfectly still

01:20:11.656 --> 01:20:13.882
in the middle of the room.

01:20:16.328 --> 01:20:18.846
His action must have run down.

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:22.516
I wound up his thought,

01:20:23.168 --> 01:20:26.687
but I forgot to do his action.

01:20:27.297 --> 01:20:31.525
Why don't you go in and wind him up?

01:20:32.344 --> 01:20:34.778
Then you can stay in

01:20:35.013 --> 01:20:37.406
and guess for yourself.

01:21:02.874 --> 01:21:05.309
Dorothy.

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:08.228
You don't have to go down there.

01:21:09.214 --> 01:21:12.775
I can use the ruby slippers

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:15.903
and send you home.

01:21:16.012 --> 01:21:18.540
And when you get back,

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.117
you will never think of Oz again.

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:24.462
What about my friends?

01:21:24.562 --> 01:21:28.165
Forget about them.
You can't help them now.

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:33.921
There's no place like home.

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:16.505
Tik-Tok!

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:40.070
Tik-Tok? Tik-Tok!

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.674
Tik-Tok, you're all wound up.

01:22:50.774 --> 01:22:52.801
What's the matter? Why did you stop?

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:55.887
It was my way of getting you in here.

01:22:55.987 --> 01:22:58.306
Pretend that you are
winding me up anyway.

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:00.924
I have an idea that may save us.

01:23:01.493 --> 01:23:03.687
I have one guess left,

01:23:03.787 --> 01:23:05.814
and if I guess incorrectly,

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:08.692
you can watch and see
what I am changed into.

01:23:08.792 --> 01:23:11.027
That may give you a clue.

01:23:11.127 --> 01:23:13.697
What a good idea!

01:23:13.797 --> 01:23:17.033
My steel brains must be damaged

01:23:17.133 --> 01:23:19.411
because I am having difficulty guessing.

01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:21.111
Tik-Tok.

01:23:31.981 --> 01:23:33.707
Don't cry.

01:24:00.051 --> 01:24:02.152
Ready?

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.905
Oz.

01:24:14.566 --> 01:24:16.959
Tik-Tok.

01:24:26.828 --> 01:24:28.762
Tik-Tok?

01:24:30.248 --> 01:24:33.767
Dorothy Gale, you're all that's left.

01:24:36.379 --> 01:24:38.355
Stop!

01:24:45.555 --> 01:24:48.532
Open up! Tell him it's important!

01:25:05.575 --> 01:25:07.519
Oz.

01:25:17.295 --> 01:25:19.396
Kneel.

01:25:22.634 --> 01:25:24.901
Lower.

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:32.844
Lower!

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:43.721
Oz.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.264
One guess left.

01:25:54.457 --> 01:25:56.693
Dorothy Gale has come back.

01:25:56.793 --> 01:26:00.405
Yes, I know. You were supposed
to bring her to me.

01:26:00.505 --> 01:26:02.907
She stole my ruby key, my powder of life

01:26:03.007 --> 01:26:06.744
and valuable antiques which
she made into a flying sofa,

01:26:06.844 --> 01:26:09.446
and she's headed this way.

01:26:15.186 --> 01:26:17.255
You know.

01:26:17.355 --> 01:26:19.215
I know everything.

01:26:19.315 --> 01:26:24.127
She's already here,
but not for much longer.

01:26:39.335 --> 01:26:42.280
Why didn't you just
transform them all right away?

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.815
It's more fun this way.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.581
But if she guesses right
and finds out about Ozma...

01:26:51.681 --> 01:26:53.583
Ozma?

01:26:53.683 --> 01:26:55.627
You haven't let her escape as well?

01:26:55.727 --> 01:26:57.786
No. No.

01:26:58.855 --> 01:27:02.290
Then there's nothing to worry about.

01:27:11.409 --> 01:27:15.647
Soon there'll be no one left

01:27:15.747 --> 01:27:18.566
who remembers Oz,

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:22.811
and I will be completely human.

01:27:32.722 --> 01:27:33.998
Oz.

01:27:34.098 --> 01:27:35.600
Dorothy!

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.335
Smudge and blazes!

01:27:37.435 --> 01:27:40.370
- Scarecrow!
- Dorothy.

01:27:40.938 --> 01:27:42.632
- You were green.
- What?

01:27:42.732 --> 01:27:46.001
- You were a green ornament.
- I was?

01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:49.138
Maybe people from Oz
turn into green ornaments.

01:27:49.238 --> 01:27:52.549
Fumes and furnaces!

01:27:54.118 --> 01:27:57.137
Green. Green, green, green.

01:28:02.085 --> 01:28:03.810
Green. It's green!

01:28:04.462 --> 01:28:08.315
You let her escape!

01:28:09.967 --> 01:28:11.985
It's green, Dorothy. Green.

01:28:14.972 --> 01:28:16.323
Oz!

01:28:16.808 --> 01:28:18.626
Oh, it's you! The Gump!

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:22.037
Petrified polymorphs!

01:28:22.146 --> 01:28:24.215
Look for green ornaments, quick.

01:28:24.315 --> 01:28:27.918
We've still got Tik-Tok, Jack
and Billina to find.

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:32.557
You had her and you let her escape!

01:28:32.657 --> 01:28:36.352
It wasn't my fault!
If you'd given me a real army...

01:28:36.452 --> 01:28:40.388
I'll take care of you later!

01:28:50.466 --> 01:28:52.776
What? Oh, no!

01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:55.747
Oh, Wheelers. Help me!

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:03.119
Dorothy!

01:29:06.357 --> 01:29:10.460
- What's happening?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.

01:29:11.028 --> 01:29:12.546
Whoa!

01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:15.423
- Scarecrow!
- Dorothy!

01:29:19.203 --> 01:29:20.855
Hang on, Dorothy.

01:29:49.358 --> 01:29:50.959
Stop!

01:29:51.569 --> 01:29:54.254
Dorothy! Dorothy!

01:29:54.405 --> 01:29:55.973
It's green!

01:29:56.073 --> 01:29:58.267
- Stop!
- Oz!

01:29:58.367 --> 01:30:02.304
- Jack!
- Oh, Mom! Where am I?

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.441
What's happening? Who's that?

01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:07.485
Stop!

01:30:07.585 --> 01:30:10.154
We haven't finished guessing yet.

01:30:10.254 --> 01:30:14.992
- You promised if we guessed correctly...
- I'm tired of games.

01:30:15.092 --> 01:30:18.695
I'm tired of all of you!

01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:25.035
Why doesn't the sofa go first?

01:30:27.438 --> 01:30:29.966
No! No! No!

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:36.013
Come on! Pull!

01:30:44.121 --> 01:30:47.859
Next, Pumpkinhead!

01:30:47.959 --> 01:30:49.893
- No!
- Run!

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.021
Run! Hurry!

01:30:53.589 --> 01:30:55.032
Faster!

01:30:55.132 --> 01:30:57.233
Nomes!

01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:07.545
Back! Go back!

01:31:07.645 --> 01:31:09.996
This way!

01:31:13.651 --> 01:31:16.002
Quick, run away!

01:31:18.656 --> 01:31:20.840
Come on! Scarecrow!

01:31:34.630 --> 01:31:36.439
Mom!

01:31:45.516 --> 01:31:47.242
No!

01:31:51.981 --> 01:31:53.549
No!

01:31:55.026 --> 01:31:56.751
Oh, dear!

01:31:57.486 --> 01:31:58.513
Billina.

01:31:59.584 --> 01:32:02.366
Oh, no! Oh, dear!

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:18.982
Mom!

01:32:21.677 --> 01:32:23.903
An egg?

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:30.753
- Poison.
- Poison.

01:32:30.853 --> 01:32:33.089
- Poison.
- Poison.

01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:35.591
- Poison.
- Poison.

01:32:35.691 --> 01:32:38.469
Oh, put me down.

01:32:38.769 --> 01:32:41.481
Oh, Mom!

01:32:41.581 --> 01:32:44.841
Mom! Look out! Look out!

01:32:47.203 --> 01:32:49.230
I finally laid my egg!

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:52.441
Oh, my head!

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:59.115
Don't you know

01:32:59.215 --> 01:33:02.326
that eggs are poison?

01:33:02.426 --> 01:33:04.579
Poison, indeed!

01:33:05.278 --> 01:33:07.353
Poison.

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:11.826
Poison to Nomes!

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.082
- Hurry, Dorothy!
- I am! I am!

01:34:02.653 --> 01:34:04.379
What are we gonna do now?

01:34:04.989 --> 01:34:07.006
I wish all of us from Oz

01:34:07.116 --> 01:34:09.393
to return there safely,

01:34:09.493 --> 01:34:14.597
and for the Emerald City and all
the people in it to be restored to life!

01:34:38.314 --> 01:34:42.292
I must say, this life is stranger
than my last one.

01:35:03.047 --> 01:35:04.981
Where's Tik-Tok?

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:07.233
We never found him.

01:35:07.384 --> 01:35:10.153
- Oh, no.
- Where'd you get that?

01:35:10.346 --> 01:35:13.457
There's a medal on your antler.

01:35:13.557 --> 01:35:16.659
That must've come
from the ornament collection.

01:35:22.858 --> 01:35:25.960
Go on. Touch it, Dorothy.

01:35:27.404 --> 01:35:28.499
Oz!

01:35:31.909 --> 01:35:36.313
Oh, Dorothy. My thinking
must have completely run down.

01:35:36.413 --> 01:35:38.765
I do not remember
leaving the Nome Kingdom.

01:35:41.919 --> 01:35:44.655
Everything's all right now.

01:36:25.254 --> 01:36:27.355
Hi. Hi.

01:36:54.783 --> 01:36:56.977
Be the Queen of Oz, Dorothy.

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:59.522
Be the Queen of Oz!

01:36:59.622 --> 01:37:01.982
- Be the Queen of Oz!
- The Queen of Oz!

01:37:02.082 --> 01:37:03.567
The Queen of Oz!

01:37:08.631 --> 01:37:10.857
Be the Queen of Oz!

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:17.613
You're the best friends
anyone's ever had.

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.117
I've got to go back.

01:37:27.858 --> 01:37:30.793
We understand, Dorothy.

01:37:32.029 --> 01:37:34.047
Do you?

01:37:37.034 --> 01:37:41.105
I wish I could be in both places
at the same time.

01:37:41.398 --> 01:37:44.599
Look! Behind you, in the mirror!

01:38:13.904 --> 01:38:16.005
It's you.

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:18.758
I was afraid you had drowned.

01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:22.595
Help me step through
the glass, Dorothy.

01:38:46.937 --> 01:38:49.205
You're so beautiful.

01:38:50.441 --> 01:38:52.635
- What's your name?
- Ozma.

01:38:52.735 --> 01:38:56.379
Mom! My real mom.

01:38:58.073 --> 01:39:03.344
She is Ozma,
Queen and rightful ruler of Oz!

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:09.109
Her father was King of Oz
before the Wizard came.

01:39:09.209 --> 01:39:11.727
Ozma grew up as Mombi's slave.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.115
When the Nome King promised Mombi
30 beautiful heads

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:16.816
if she kept Ozma a secret,

01:39:16.967 --> 01:39:19.703
she enchanted her into the mirror.

01:39:19.803 --> 01:39:21.872
I forgive Mombi.

01:39:21.972 --> 01:39:25.501
Dorothy has punished her
by removing her magical powers,

01:39:25.601 --> 01:39:29.546
and a witch with no magic
is a miserable creature indeed.

01:39:29.646 --> 01:39:31.747
And that's a fact.

01:39:37.488 --> 01:39:41.225
Now, please, wish me back to Kansas.

01:39:41.325 --> 01:39:43.394
On one condition.

01:39:43.494 --> 01:39:45.761
I will look in on you from time to time,

01:39:45.954 --> 01:39:48.732
and if you ever wish to return to Oz,

01:39:48.832 --> 01:39:50.901
I will make it so.

01:39:51.001 --> 01:39:53.070
Goodbye, Dorothy.

01:39:53.170 --> 01:39:55.322
You're not coming back, Billina?

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:59.775
No. Not to that stupid,
humdrum world again.

01:40:02.471 --> 01:40:03.706
Goodbye, Dorothy.

01:40:03.806 --> 01:40:07.584
Oh, no. I mean, I didn't
expect to go so soon.

01:40:07.684 --> 01:40:11.005
I haven't really said goodbye yet.

01:40:11.781 --> 01:40:13.382
Goodbye, Cowardly Lion.

01:40:13.482 --> 01:40:16.593
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- Tik-Tok.

01:40:16.693 --> 01:40:18.846
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:20.431
I'll never forget any of you.

01:40:20.531 --> 01:40:22.548
Give my love to all the chickens.

01:40:23.659 --> 01:40:27.187
- Dorothy...
- I love you so much.

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.732
- Farewell!
- Goodbye, Dorothy.

01:40:29.832 --> 01:40:31.608
Farewell, Dorothy!

01:40:31.708 --> 01:40:34.028
- It's so bright.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:38.240
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- I love you all! Goodbye!

01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:41.243
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Dorothy.

01:40:50.394 --> 01:40:53.380
Goodbye! Goodbye!

01:41:19.715 --> 01:41:23.192
Goodbye. Bye.

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:30.157
Goodbye.

01:41:55.792 --> 01:41:57.476
Toto?

01:42:00.631 --> 01:42:02.732
Toto!

01:42:04.152 --> 01:42:05.484
Toto!

01:42:07.796 --> 01:42:10.679
Toto! Toto!

01:42:16.605 --> 01:42:18.205
Dorothy?

01:42:18.649 --> 01:42:20.300
Dorothy?

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.343
Dorothy!

01:42:24.112 --> 01:42:27.224
Oh, are you all right?

01:42:27.324 --> 01:42:29.550
Toto found me.

01:42:30.482 --> 01:42:33.596
I'd almost given up hope.

01:42:42.005 --> 01:42:44.357
Up you go, sweetheart.

01:42:45.801 --> 01:42:47.777
It's Dorothy!

01:42:48.804 --> 01:42:53.333
The clinic was hit by lightning
and it burned to the ground.

01:42:53.433 --> 01:42:56.086
Everybody was rescued
except Dr. Worley.

01:42:56.186 --> 01:42:59.038
He ran in to rescue his machines.

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:06.462
Mornin', all.

01:43:32.014 --> 01:43:33.489
Hi, hon.

01:43:56.747 --> 01:43:58.180
Ozma.

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:07.189
Aunt Em, come and look!

01:44:07.749 --> 01:44:10.242
What is it, darling? I'm busy.

01:44:12.095 --> 01:44:14.613
Nothing. Just a reflection.

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.878
What is it, Dorothy?

01:44:36.745 --> 01:44:39.555
It's nice to have a room
of your own, isn't it?

01:44:40.957 --> 01:44:43.184
Put the mirror straight, sweetheart.

01:44:57.808 --> 01:45:00.034
Come on, you two.

01:45:00.936 --> 01:45:03.996
It's too nice a day to stay inside.

01:45:04.314 --> 01:45:05.442
Come on, Toto.

01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:29.156
Toto, come on!

01:45:35.637 --> 01:45:37.780
Good dog!
