The entire last year.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.305
I wouldn't mind doing some fieldwork.

who handle the fieldwork.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.043
All things considered on certain occasions,

00:19.068 --> 00:20.596
I'd say you're...

00:20.621 --> 00:22.166
Pretty remarkable.

00:22.191 --> 00:24.022
Oh, and I don't think you're an idiot.

00:24.047 --> 00:26.016
- Thanks.
- You're more of an imbecile.

00:28.728 --> 00:30.505
It's so nice to finally meet you, Kirsten.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.932
Kirsten: Did Ed Clark commit suicide?

00:31.957 --> 00:33.268
- No.
- How did he die?

00:33.293 --> 00:34.292
Protecting you.

00:34.318 --> 00:35.652
Ed Clark left this for me.

00:35.677 --> 00:37.099
It has a sequence of terms on it.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.495
Do you think you could try
and decipher them for me?

00:38.520 --> 00:40.011
Linus: Those digital codes on the cassette

00:40.036 --> 00:42.089
that Ed gave you, they're map coordinates.

Not who. These boots.

They're sick!

01:06.377 --> 01:08.279

- No.
- You don't need new boots.

myself every once in a while.

01:23.123 --> 01:24.492
Yeah, but there's no surplus.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.761
And these have patent purple
leather, tigers eye buttons,

01:43.198 --> 01:45.173
How do you know how long I take in there?

01:46.008 --> 01:48.578

in trying to surprise you,

02:07.284 --> 02:08.958

There is evidence of a scuffle

Okay, his name is Liam, and
he is drop-dead delicious.

03:51.975 --> 03:53.056
What do you know about him?

03:53.075 --> 03:55.474
Nothing. He just showed
up at our door this morning

recruited me to spy on Kirsten,

04:11.458 --> 04:14.185

Okay, so the situation
requires tact and discretion.

09:23.213 --> 09:24.714
Maybe you should wait outside.

09:24.739 --> 09:26.178
Maybe you should bite me.

me do all the talking.

10:31.849 --> 10:33.887

10:37.583 --> 10:39.384
That's so true.

10:39.409 --> 10:40.444

10:40.469 --> 10:41.754
And thanks for letting me stay here.

10:41.779 --> 10:43.551

And before that a yurt in southeast Asia.

10:50.810 --> 10:51.684
(Scoffs)

10:51.709 --> 10:52.895
Shut the front door.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.594
A yurt by choice?

10:54.619 --> 10:56.160
Well, I'm a cultural anthropologist,

10:56.185 --> 10:58.554
so I need to immerse
myself in different ways

10:58.579 --> 11:00.448
of life, so I can contribute something

11:00.473 --> 11:02.641
positive to the local community.

11:02.666 --> 11:03.901
And you?

11:03.926 --> 11:05.928
Me? Oh, I don't do
anything to help mankind.

11:05.953 --> 11:07.354
I'm completely self-absorbed.

11:07.379 --> 11:09.949
So where does Kirsten fit
in all of your good-doing?

11:09.974 --> 11:11.306
She doesn't.

11:11.331 --> 11:13.833
At least not the way I'd like her to.

11:13.858 --> 11:16.525
We met three years ago, I've
asked her on a few trips,

11:16.550 --> 11:19.320
but she has her own goals of course,

11:19.345 --> 11:21.507
so we end up spending a lot of time apart.

11:21.532 --> 11:23.167
That's terrible.

11:23.192 --> 11:25.051
Fortunately, time doesn't
mean anything to her,

11:25.076 --> 11:27.045
so we just pick up where we left off.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.452
I love that about her.

11:28.477 --> 11:29.478
Don't you?

11:30.172 --> 11:32.174
Totally. (Clears throat)

11:32.199 --> 11:35.351
She lives in the moment as we all should.

11:35.910 --> 11:37.692
Just one of the many things that makes

11:37.717 --> 11:39.950
Kirsten so... damn lovable.

11:45.757 --> 11:46.725
Thank you.

11:46.750 --> 11:47.817
Look familiar?

11:47.842 --> 11:49.960
Kirsten: Looks identical.

11:49.985 --> 11:50.860
This is the house.

12:01.603 --> 12:03.471
Hello. Sorry to keep you waiting.

12:03.496 --> 12:05.665
I'm Special Agent Maggie Baptiste.

12:05.690 --> 12:07.625
I'm on an assignment with L.A.P.D.

12:07.650 --> 12:09.812
- And you are...
- Oh, we're, um...

12:09.837 --> 12:11.617
Graduate students of
criminology and forensics.

12:11.642 --> 12:12.743
We're tagging along.

12:12.768 --> 12:13.927
What she said.

12:14.893 --> 12:18.616
Mr. and Mrs. Parks, I'm sorry, I
have bad news to share with you.

12:18.641 --> 12:20.961
The body of a young woman, early 20s,

12:20.986 --> 12:25.057
brunette, five foot four, was found
on a hiking trail below Mulholland.

12:25.393 --> 12:27.945
Someone was killed in our neighborhood?

12:27.970 --> 12:30.545
I... I'm so sorry. How can we help?

12:30.570 --> 12:32.047
We believe that she lived here.

12:32.072 --> 12:33.946
That's impossible.

12:33.971 --> 12:35.281
Do you have a daughter?

12:35.306 --> 12:37.308
No, it's just Suzanne and I.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.133
Fourth of July, where were you?

12:39.158 --> 12:41.453
I'm sorry, are you studying

12:41.478 --> 12:43.052
forensics or interrogation?

12:43.077 --> 12:45.343
We have reason to believe
that the victim hosted a party

12:45.368 --> 12:46.710
here on the fourth of July.

12:46.736 --> 12:48.505
We were out of town that weekend.

12:48.530 --> 12:50.641
I was at a SPA in Oheim,

12:50.665 --> 12:52.134
my husband was in Portland.

12:52.159 --> 12:53.927
So it's possible the victim knew

12:53.952 --> 12:54.877
your house would be empty.

12:54.902 --> 12:56.938
The alarm company would have notified us

12:56.963 --> 12:58.000
if someone broke in.

12:58.025 --> 12:59.393
Not if they bypassed the alarm.

12:59.418 --> 13:01.187
I'm sure I would know
if a bunch of strangers

13:01.212 --> 13:02.800
held a party in my home.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.599
We must have the wrong house.

13:04.624 --> 13:08.161
No. I saw that hallway,
the couch, the sculpture...

13:08.186 --> 13:09.221
- It's all...
- Excuse...

13:09.246 --> 13:10.703
I'm sorry, you saw...

13:10.728 --> 13:12.086
She means the um...

13:12.111 --> 13:14.686
Photo spread in the Mulholland Magazine.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.447
- Oh.
- What are you hiding?

13:16.472 --> 13:17.387
Kirsten!

13:17.412 --> 13:19.787
We're not hiding anything,
and I resent the accusation.

13:19.812 --> 13:22.695
Mr. Parks: Here's a name I want
you to remember: Jonathan Tuckman.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.765
His firm is Franklin and
Tuckman in Century City.

13:25.790 --> 13:26.924
He's my lawyer.

13:26.949 --> 13:30.038
Any more questions, talk to him.

13:30.063 --> 13:32.562
Sorry to disturb you.
We will find our way out.

13:32.587 --> 13:34.322
- But I know...
- Kirsten.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.168
I'm sorry about that.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.495
She's the worst student in our program.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.672
Beautiful home.

13:41.697 --> 13:42.731
Maggie: Cameron!

13:42.756 --> 13:43.672
Gotta go.

13:46.089 --> 13:48.820
Maggie: Tact and discretion
are not in your vocabulary.

13:48.845 --> 13:50.647
- Told you.
- I know what I saw.

13:50.672 --> 13:51.740
In a dead girl's memory.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.641
Do you want to explain
that to those people?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.141
I'm not wrong.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.633
There is one thing I know for sure,

13:56.658 --> 13:58.793
nothing and no one is foolproof.

13:58.818 --> 14:00.664
Whatever Kirsten's seen
in the stitch she's aways

14:00.689 --> 14:02.691
been able to piece together,
so she may not be foolproof,

14:02.716 --> 14:04.277
but she'll do until foolproof shows up.

14:05.692 --> 14:08.234
Fabulous speech. Get in the car.

14:12.831 --> 14:14.751
(Elevator ding)

14:18.253 --> 14:20.422
Hey! How'd everything go at the mansion?

14:20.447 --> 14:23.206
Badly. The Parks have
no idea who Jane Doe is.

14:23.231 --> 14:24.901
She's not a Jane Doe anymore.

14:24.926 --> 14:26.394
You made the I.D.?

14:26.419 --> 14:28.621
Well, the only thing
they found in her pockets

14:28.646 --> 14:29.702
were her keys...

14:30.531 --> 14:32.401
And this.

14:32.426 --> 14:33.927
A plastic bag?

14:33.952 --> 14:35.531
Or a doggy poop bag.

14:36.936 --> 14:39.651
I know you mentioned you
saw a dog in the stitch.

14:39.676 --> 14:41.909
Well, where there's a poop
bag, there's gotta be a dog.

14:41.934 --> 14:43.510
So I did a search and I got a hit...

14:43.535 --> 14:45.339
Bel Air animal shelter.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.784
Meet Giorgio.

14:49.376 --> 14:52.698
Aw, he's so cute.

14:52.723 --> 14:55.298
Well, someone just found him
wandering and turned him in.

14:55.323 --> 14:56.198
Oh, he's sweet.

14:56.223 --> 14:59.198
(Barking)

14:59.826 --> 15:02.498
I... I saw him barking
at a guy in the stitch.

15:02.523 --> 15:04.597
Luckily he was chipped.

15:04.622 --> 15:06.557
That's his owner. Brenda Miller.

15:06.582 --> 15:09.096
She goes by Bentley Miller
on Twitter and Facebook.

15:09.121 --> 15:11.518
- Nice work.
- Thank the pooch.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.518
He's wandering all alone in this world...

15:13.543 --> 15:15.318
Filled out the papers for adoption.

15:15.343 --> 15:17.718
But do not tell my parents.

15:18.154 --> 15:20.417
Kirsten: Forget the dog,
where's Bentley's keys?

15:22.243 --> 15:23.310
(Door shutting)

15:23.335 --> 15:24.690
We're a long way from Mulholland.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.729
Thought you said she was rich.

15:26.754 --> 15:28.389
It seemed like it.

15:29.993 --> 15:31.528
So who's Liam?

15:33.358 --> 15:35.428
Um... boyfriend.

15:35.453 --> 15:37.088
Sort of.

15:37.113 --> 15:39.482
Boyfriend adjacent. He travels a lot.

15:39.507 --> 15:42.328
Hmm. Long distance relationships are hard.

15:42.353 --> 15:43.921
Yeah, not... not for me.

15:43.946 --> 15:45.581
Right.

15:46.478 --> 15:49.967
I mean, when he's here it's fine,

15:49.992 --> 15:51.592
and when he's gone, it's like he's always

15:51.617 --> 15:52.891
been away. I never miss him.

15:53.455 --> 15:55.378
You're the ultimate no-strings girlfriend.

16:00.780 --> 16:04.064
Whoa, someone dreamed about living large.

16:04.089 --> 16:07.662
Meanwhile, all she has is junk.
Nothing worth killing over.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.915
(Rattling)

16:34.912 --> 16:37.113
That on the other hand, might be.

16:43.155 --> 16:46.024
Maggie: There's been a series of break-ins
of homes near Mulholland Drive.

16:46.025 --> 16:48.436
No leads until the jewelry you found

16:48.461 --> 16:50.029
was linked to those burglaries.

16:50.062 --> 16:51.585
That's Maggie for "thank you."

16:51.610 --> 16:53.578
All right well, I spoke to
Bentley's family in Kansas.

16:53.603 --> 16:56.406
Apparently, she moved out
here to become rich and famous.

16:56.431 --> 16:58.466
I guess breaking into homes
was part of her business plan.

16:58.491 --> 16:59.860
Let's not play "blame the victim."

16:59.885 --> 17:02.020
We know who she was and
what she was involved in.

17:02.045 --> 17:03.261
Why was she killed?

17:03.286 --> 17:05.320
She might've gotten
tangled with an accomplice,

17:05.346 --> 17:07.855
or someone she tried
selling the stolen goods to,

17:07.880 --> 17:09.788
or... someone she stole from.

17:09.813 --> 17:11.446
No, I think she kept it all.

17:11.472 --> 17:14.442
I mean, that jewelry made
her feel better about herself.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.837
It made her feel like she mattered.

17:19.281 --> 17:21.787
I searched Bentley's social media presence.

17:22.217 --> 17:24.672
Her one friend was in a
lot of photos with her.

17:24.696 --> 17:26.564
She was near the hot tub with Bentley.

17:26.565 --> 17:27.965
Yeah, this is Sadie Morton.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.801
She works at a high-end
spa in Beverly Hills.

17:29.802 --> 17:31.988
I'm pushing her "deets"
out to everyone right now.

17:37.158 --> 17:40.161
Oh hey! K's got a hot dinner tonight.

17:40.186 --> 17:42.255
We're in the middle of a case.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.682
Cameron, how long until
the refractory period is up?

17:44.707 --> 17:47.110
- Six hours.
- So we'll call you if we need you.

17:47.135 --> 17:48.320
Right, Maggie?

17:49.423 --> 17:51.125
Make sure that you can be reached.

17:51.150 --> 17:52.388
Cameron, why don't you go see

17:52.413 --> 17:54.315
what you can find out about Sadie Morton?

17:56.875 --> 17:58.743
- Where are you going?
- I was coming with you.

17:58.768 --> 18:00.770
- I don't need any help.
- I'll keep you company.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.770
Dude I... I've never been to a spa before.

18:05.188 --> 18:06.480
- Fine.
- All right.

18:06.505 --> 18:08.670
- We can get mani-pedis.
- You're kidding, right?

18:09.050 --> 18:11.652
We'll call you if we need you.

18:11.677 --> 18:14.069
Enjoy your dinner with Liam,

18:14.094 --> 18:16.170
just don't show up wearing that.

18:21.490 --> 18:22.558
Liam?

18:22.958 --> 18:24.459
Hey.

18:25.058 --> 18:26.500
Look at you.

18:26.525 --> 18:28.026
Look at you.

18:28.027 --> 18:29.494
Aren't we going out?

18:29.495 --> 18:32.498
Well I thought so, but
I went to take a shower,

18:32.523 --> 18:34.112
and there was no hot water.

18:34.420 --> 18:37.112
Yeah. I need to get the heater fixed.

18:37.622 --> 18:39.513
Not anymore. I fixed it.

18:40.011 --> 18:41.746
Really?

18:42.441 --> 18:43.708
Thank you.

18:43.709 --> 18:46.112
Then I figured I would whip up some dinner,

18:46.137 --> 18:47.913
and we could hang here.

18:48.638 --> 18:50.013
Oh.

18:50.900 --> 18:53.612
Unless you'd rather go out.

18:54.429 --> 18:56.231
You know, it's um...

18:56.256 --> 19:00.760
It's just that I bought
all this stuff for tonight.

19:00.785 --> 19:02.256
This is for you.

19:03.550 --> 19:05.752
Okay, thanks so much,

19:05.777 --> 19:08.480
but I can't accept this.

19:08.505 --> 19:09.756
This is too expensive.

19:11.566 --> 19:13.057
Are you okay?

19:13.719 --> 19:15.206
Yeah, of course. Why?

19:15.982 --> 19:17.307
The clothes, the makeup.

19:17.332 --> 19:19.968
You usually keep it... simple.

19:20.191 --> 19:23.691
Mm. Yeah, I had a weird day at work,

19:23.716 --> 19:26.307
and I think it's affecting me.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.929
What are you doing for work these days?

19:28.954 --> 19:30.622
Oh, you know me.

19:30.623 --> 19:34.056
Just geeky computer stuff.

19:34.433 --> 19:36.156
It pays the bills.

19:37.145 --> 19:39.147
Well, you're home now.

19:39.172 --> 19:40.321
Relax.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.705
I've missed you.

19:50.576 --> 19:52.553
And I know in your way
you've missed me, too.

19:52.578 --> 19:55.814
♪ I can feel ♪

19:55.815 --> 19:59.385
♪ It all rushing back in ♪

20:05.325 --> 20:07.034
I asked you to find out about Liam,

20:07.059 --> 20:09.727
not make sure Kirsten could
spend more time with him.

20:09.728 --> 20:12.627
Look, I did the requested snooping.

20:12.652 --> 20:14.954
I searched the Internet, I
even scoured the deep web,

20:14.979 --> 20:17.448
Liam Granger, totally clean.

20:17.473 --> 20:18.798
There are no red flags.

20:18.823 --> 20:21.893
This guy is like the lovechild
between Brad Pitt and Mother Teresa.

20:21.918 --> 20:24.281
I checked his junk, I...

20:24.306 --> 20:26.875
Looked through his personal items,

20:26.942 --> 20:28.634
and I got you some photos.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.348
The point is, if Kirsten wasn't

20:31.373 --> 20:32.981
dating Liam, I'd be all over him.

20:33.006 --> 20:35.682
- Oh! Um...
- Yes?

20:35.711 --> 20:38.557
Can we switch gears for a
second and talk about my...

20:38.582 --> 20:40.759
- No.
- Okay.

20:56.799 --> 20:59.098
Okay great, we'll see you this afternoon.

21:01.001 --> 21:02.736
Hello, gentlemen.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.097
I'm sorry, we're only
seeing women right now.

21:05.122 --> 21:06.389
Awesome.

21:07.229 --> 21:09.564
Actually, we need to talk to Sadie Morton.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.955
May I ask what it's regarding?

21:11.980 --> 21:14.537
We are here on official business.

21:17.081 --> 21:18.683
She's with a client right now.

21:18.708 --> 21:20.610
Would you like to wait for
her in the harmony room?

21:20.635 --> 21:22.069
It's out and to the right.

21:23.539 --> 21:24.773
Thank you.

21:27.114 --> 21:28.349
Where did you get that?

21:28.435 --> 21:30.096
Comic-con.

21:31.191 --> 21:34.082
- Imperial police.
- Mm-hmm.

21:34.107 --> 21:36.542
(Chairs humming)

21:36.567 --> 21:38.882
- Linus?
- Yeah?

21:39.402 --> 21:40.828
How does a girl trust a guy

21:40.853 --> 21:41.987
who disappears for two years

21:42.012 --> 21:44.578
and then suddenly reappears?

21:44.665 --> 21:46.066
You're asking me?

21:46.091 --> 21:47.792
I don't know, you and Camille

21:47.793 --> 21:48.934
kind of sort of had that thing.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.771
Kind of sort of clearly doesn't make

21:50.796 --> 21:52.030
me an expert on women.

21:52.031 --> 21:53.831
- Hi.
- Oh! Hi.

21:53.832 --> 21:55.667
Um, we're um...

21:55.668 --> 21:57.257
With the police. I know.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.752
We need to ask you a few
questions about Bentley Miller.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.545
It's so sad.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.683
I can't believe Bents is gone.

22:02.708 --> 22:05.358
Her mom called me. It's just awful.

22:05.383 --> 22:06.550
Where were you last night?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.822
Wait, you think I killed her?

22:08.847 --> 22:11.449
I think the two of you broke into
people's houses and stole from them.

22:11.450 --> 22:13.418
Oh my...

22:13.419 --> 22:14.452
Am I under arrest?

22:14.453 --> 22:16.386
Depends how the next few minutes go, ma'am.

22:16.411 --> 22:19.633
I'm the bad cop in this relationship.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.729
Okay, we called it "house sitting"...

22:22.761 --> 22:24.495
breaking into houses to party.

22:24.496 --> 22:26.798
But we only did it when
people were out of town.

22:26.799 --> 22:27.832
We never hurt anyone.

22:27.833 --> 22:29.934
And you stole from them.

22:29.935 --> 22:32.870
No! No. At least I didn't.

22:32.871 --> 22:35.232
We just wanted to know how it felt
like to have everything we wanted,

22:35.257 --> 22:36.737
even if it was just for a little bit.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.728
Only thing is, Bentley got greedy.

22:38.753 --> 22:40.473
I gave Bentley the info on who was gonna be

22:40.480 --> 22:43.033
out of town, and she
disarmed the alarm systems.

22:43.058 --> 22:45.059
I have a lot of wealthy clients here.

22:45.084 --> 22:47.719
Did you break into Joe
and Suzanne Parks' house?

22:47.720 --> 22:51.122
Yes. We were partying
and Mr. Parks came home.

22:51.123 --> 22:52.824
We got out of there, but Bentley couldn't.

22:52.825 --> 22:55.033
She was trapped inside
there with him for hours.

22:55.597 --> 22:56.704
Parks lied.

22:56.729 --> 22:58.130
He wasn't out of town.

22:59.738 --> 23:02.074
Miss Morton, we're gonna have
to ask you to stay in town.

23:02.099 --> 23:03.801
At most, we're gonna need
your cell phone number

23:03.802 --> 23:05.490
just in case we have any
more interrogating to do.

23:05.515 --> 23:06.616
What?

23:07.461 --> 23:08.590
Or not.

23:10.522 --> 23:12.108
You're dismissed.

23:16.030 --> 23:17.765
I'm calling Kirsten.

23:17.790 --> 23:19.532
You're just a chicken.

23:20.705 --> 23:23.433
(Romantic music playing)

23:46.929 --> 23:48.942
(Phone buzzing)

23:58.402 --> 24:00.318
(Knocking rapidly)

24:03.164 --> 24:05.417
Oh! Hey.

24:05.749 --> 24:08.118
Why haven't you answered your phone?

24:08.143 --> 24:09.618
Um...

24:10.876 --> 24:12.917
- Been busy.
- Busy doing what?

24:13.901 --> 24:15.318
Hello, mate.

24:15.959 --> 24:17.026
Hello.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.917
Liam, Cameron.

24:19.614 --> 24:21.018
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:21.043 --> 24:24.231
I... I didn't mean to interrupt.

24:24.256 --> 24:25.731
I was, um...

24:25.756 --> 24:27.091
Just haven't answered your phone,

24:27.116 --> 24:30.231
and we kind of need you at the office.

24:30.256 --> 24:33.392
It's, um... kind of an emergency.

24:33.417 --> 24:35.386
Okay. Sorry. I'll be quick.

24:38.038 --> 24:39.640
Excuse me for a second.

24:39.665 --> 24:40.898
Sure.

24:40.899 --> 24:42.504
So what do you do for work exactly?

24:42.529 --> 24:45.265
Oh! Um...

24:46.343 --> 24:48.378
(Sniffs) Do I smell matsutake?

24:48.403 --> 24:49.538
Yeah, good nose.

24:49.563 --> 24:52.163
It's matsutake mushroom
risotto to be exact.

24:52.188 --> 24:53.722
But those mushrooms aren't in season.

24:53.747 --> 24:55.672
But I have friends in fungal places.

24:55.697 --> 24:56.573
Oh.

24:56.598 --> 24:59.273
- You should try some.
- Oh, no. It's fine.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.672
Oh... okay.

25:02.613 --> 25:04.348
Actually not bad.

25:05.351 --> 25:07.762
Sorry, Liam. I'll be back as soon as I can.

25:07.787 --> 25:09.622
I understand.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.178
Wait just one second.

25:14.064 --> 25:15.957
So...

25:16.682 --> 25:18.356
That's Liam.

25:18.381 --> 25:20.350
- Your point?
- No point.

25:20.423 --> 25:22.683
The risotto was a little
undercooked, though.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.743
But he seems like a decent enough fellow.

25:24.929 --> 25:26.692
- You're different around him.
- How so?

25:26.717 --> 25:30.492
Just more of a Betty, less of a Veronica.

25:30.517 --> 25:33.654
Oh, so I'm usually a Veronica,
and around Liam I'm a Betty?

25:33.679 --> 25:34.691
Yeah.

25:34.716 --> 25:35.592
So what does that make you?

25:35.617 --> 25:38.186
Archie? Or Reggie?

25:38.211 --> 25:39.559
Possibly Jughead.

25:39.821 --> 25:41.823
So you're not worried
about messing up anything

25:41.848 --> 25:44.051
with the Stitchers Program, your friends?

25:44.076 --> 25:47.513
Oh... oh wait, you think
Liam is a threat to that?

25:47.538 --> 25:48.572
(Scoffs)

25:49.034 --> 25:52.352
Why can't I have all that and also Liam?

25:52.377 --> 25:54.152
Why can't I have it all?

25:54.177 --> 25:55.652
Liam: Dessert.

25:56.599 --> 25:58.052
To go.

26:00.609 --> 26:01.810
Thanks.

26:01.835 --> 26:03.751
You're amazing.

26:13.792 --> 26:15.918
Lights at 20%, please.

26:16.785 --> 26:19.755
Comm check. One, two. Talk to me, Betty.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.403
Yes, Jughead. I hear you.

26:21.428 --> 26:23.703
- Linus, what are they talking about?
- I don't know,

26:23.728 --> 26:25.333
but I thought I was Jughead.

26:25.358 --> 26:26.392
Cameron: All systems are go.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.060
We are in the pipe five by five.

26:29.085 --> 26:31.388
Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark.

26:31.413 --> 26:35.049
Three, two, one...

26:36.312 --> 26:37.749
Work.

26:42.741 --> 26:47.507
I'm in the Parks mansion in a huge bedroom.

26:59.508 --> 27:01.402
Someone's home!

27:12.293 --> 27:15.383
(Woman laughing)

27:18.649 --> 27:20.485
(Kissing)

27:20.510 --> 27:22.979
Joe Parks just brought
another woman into the bedroom.

27:23.004 --> 27:24.072
With Bentley there?

27:24.097 --> 27:25.431
She's hiding.

27:25.456 --> 27:29.077
(Indistinct mumbling)

27:45.512 --> 27:47.481
She's videoing them on her phone.

27:47.506 --> 27:49.377
(Moaning)

27:55.546 --> 27:57.115
(Footsteps)

27:57.140 --> 27:58.351
I'm now on Mulholland.

27:58.376 --> 28:00.011
Bentley is here walking Giorgio.

28:00.036 --> 28:01.071
(Car door opens)

28:01.096 --> 28:02.999
- Wait.
- (Car door shuts)

28:03.036 --> 28:04.137
(Loud beeping)

28:04.162 --> 28:06.098
Her adrenaline is spiking.

28:07.483 --> 28:09.181
Someone's coming.

28:16.969 --> 28:18.537
The price just went up.

28:18.562 --> 28:20.336
You better pay or this is going public.

28:26.517 --> 28:28.119
30 seconds till the bounce.

28:28.144 --> 28:30.246
- What's happening?
- They're fighting.

28:30.271 --> 28:31.439
Who's Bentley fighting with?

28:31.464 --> 28:32.943
Kirsten, who's fighting with her?

28:32.968 --> 28:34.742
I can't tell.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.696
(Screams, thuds)

28:38.721 --> 28:39.788
I'm bouncing.

28:39.813 --> 28:42.082
- Exit pin code.
- "iheartliam."

28:43.008 --> 28:46.060
I mean Linus. "iheartlinus."

28:50.117 --> 28:51.960
I never got a good look at who pushed her,

28:51.985 --> 28:53.630
someone in a peacoat and gloves.

28:53.663 --> 28:55.927
But Bentley recorded Joe
Parks having an affair,

28:55.952 --> 28:57.220
and then blackmailed him.

28:57.245 --> 28:58.446
- He must have killed her.
- Yeah.

28:58.471 --> 28:59.904
But now we know not for what she stole,

28:59.929 --> 29:01.102
for what she saw.

29:01.127 --> 29:04.102
Well I think it's time for the
L.A.P.D. to bring Joe Parks in.

29:12.037 --> 29:13.787
Camille: But his name is already Giorgio.

29:13.812 --> 29:16.631
Yeah I know, but what
kind of name is Giorgio?

29:16.655 --> 29:18.130
What were you thinking of changing it to?

29:18.155 --> 29:19.607
Abhishek, Mahesh, Swaminathan...

29:19.632 --> 29:20.707
You know, something totally normal.

29:20.732 --> 29:23.740
Okay, people. Mr. Parks is in custody.

29:23.765 --> 29:25.500
He lawyered up, but they found evidence

29:25.525 --> 29:28.240
that he had texted Bentley the
week before she was murdered,

29:28.265 --> 29:29.833
so job well done.

29:29.858 --> 29:32.140
Cameron: This calls for celebration.

29:32.165 --> 29:35.123
Dinner? My place? 7:00 P.M.? I'm cooking.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.724
So is Liam. Sorry.

29:36.748 --> 29:38.373
He's cooking tonight for Camille and I.

29:38.398 --> 29:40.774
And he cooks too! He's amazing.

29:40.799 --> 29:42.274
It's a consensus.

29:42.298 --> 29:44.672
Not a problem. Tapas for one it is.

29:46.128 --> 29:48.273
Make it two. I'll bring beer.

29:48.298 --> 29:49.773
I thought you were picking
up Giorgio tonight.

29:49.798 --> 29:51.912
The shelter just texted me.

29:51.937 --> 29:54.818
Apparently Giorgio hates men,

29:54.843 --> 29:56.818
gets all Tasmanian devil
and barks and stuff.

29:56.843 --> 29:58.617
I got rejected as a potential owner.

29:58.642 --> 30:01.018
Oh, I'm sorry Linus.

30:01.856 --> 30:03.417
Bro night?

30:04.685 --> 30:07.917
I got him. Go.

30:10.816 --> 30:12.647
Have fun with Lance!

30:13.092 --> 30:14.748
Linus: His name is Liam.

30:14.773 --> 30:15.647
I know his name.

30:15.672 --> 30:17.240
Marcona almonds, quince paste,

30:17.265 --> 30:18.600
dried apricots, fig marmalade,

30:18.625 --> 30:20.912
- and...
- Grapes. Yum.

30:20.937 --> 30:23.312
Well then why did you call him "Lance"?

30:23.766 --> 30:26.612
What do you think of the fig marmalade?

30:27.330 --> 30:29.612
- It's figgy.
- Mm-hmm.

30:29.637 --> 30:30.511
(Clears throat)

30:30.536 --> 30:31.842
Why don't you like Liam?

30:31.867 --> 30:32.948
Who said I don't like Liam?

30:33.002 --> 30:34.604
You referred to him as something you do

30:34.629 --> 30:35.873
to a boil on a person's neck.

30:35.898 --> 30:37.972
Mm-hmm. Refill?

30:37.997 --> 30:40.373
Somebody's jealous!

30:40.398 --> 30:42.173
Dude... okay.

30:42.198 --> 30:43.794
The guy has been gone for two years

30:43.819 --> 30:45.792
and just randomly shows
up out of the blue, okay?

30:45.817 --> 30:47.990
I'm worried. I don't
want Kirsten to get hurt.

30:48.015 --> 30:49.190
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.989
Do you think Liam is one of those guys?

30:51.014 --> 30:52.190
Dude! He's perfect.

30:52.215 --> 30:54.251
He's got this, you know,
perfect smile, and his...

30:54.276 --> 30:56.090
Perfect abs.

30:56.115 --> 30:57.005
Wait, you saw his abs?

30:57.030 --> 30:58.427
And he's this total do-gooder,

30:58.452 --> 31:00.454
just dedicated to saving the
planet. Did I mention that?

31:00.479 --> 31:01.427
Wait, wait. Back up, back up.

31:01.452 --> 31:03.226
You saw his abs?

31:03.251 --> 31:05.026
It's this total like...

31:05.051 --> 31:07.427
Greek God six-pack thing.

31:07.452 --> 31:08.921
Okay.

31:09.261 --> 31:10.648
Yeah, you should be worried.

31:10.673 --> 31:13.127
Okay, and who has time to research

31:13.152 --> 31:16.427
social and cultural phenomena
around the world and work out?

31:16.452 --> 31:17.887
Well what does the Internet say about him?

31:17.912 --> 31:19.726
I didn't check. I don't
want to be one of those guys.

31:19.751 --> 31:22.726
Well, good thing for you, I am.

31:22.751 --> 31:24.827
- What's his last name?
- Granger. Liam Granger.

31:28.867 --> 31:30.001
What?

31:30.026 --> 31:33.472
Oh. Oh this... this is not good.

31:33.497 --> 31:35.089
I knew it. Tell me... no, don't.

31:35.114 --> 31:37.188
- Ah!
- Okay, tell me.

31:37.213 --> 31:40.814
It's all true. Liam is perfect.

31:40.839 --> 31:42.915
Liam is perfect.

31:42.940 --> 31:43.814
Mm-hmm.

31:44.267 --> 31:45.479
(Dinging)

31:45.504 --> 31:47.072
Oh! That's our saffron-infused rice.

31:47.097 --> 31:49.565
Dude, screw the saffron.
You know what we need?

31:49.590 --> 31:52.264
To do 1,000 sit ups and start a
foundation for starving children?

31:52.677 --> 31:56.662
No, we... we need a real bro night.

31:56.687 --> 31:59.366
- But this is real.
- This is faux bro.

31:59.391 --> 32:01.660
We need real bro!

32:02.754 --> 32:04.556
No.

32:05.018 --> 32:06.267
No way.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.360
(Gasps)

32:07.385 --> 32:09.566
The boots? For me? From you?

32:09.591 --> 32:10.767
Shut up!

32:10.792 --> 32:12.267
You said you wanted them.

32:12.292 --> 32:14.066
Well, want them? I want to marry them,

32:14.091 --> 32:15.866
but they're way way too expensive.

32:15.891 --> 32:17.066
- I can't.
- Don't worry.

32:17.091 --> 32:18.267
Liam fixed the water heater,

32:18.292 --> 32:20.395
which saved us way more
than those boots cost, so...

32:20.420 --> 32:22.767
Okay. I know you're not a hugger,

32:22.792 --> 32:23.667
but...

32:24.943 --> 32:26.467
And you!

32:26.492 --> 32:29.194
Thank you, handsome for the
water heater and for making

32:29.219 --> 32:32.767
Kirsten more awesome
than she already... was?

32:32.792 --> 32:34.566
Is? Are those fried cheesy rice balls?

32:34.848 --> 32:36.366
(Barking)

32:37.544 --> 32:39.967
(Barking)

32:44.253 --> 32:46.555
Ignore Cujo. Hand me your balls.

32:46.580 --> 32:48.964
Thank you so much. (Sniffs)

32:48.989 --> 32:50.328
Mr. Parks didn't kill Bentley.

32:50.353 --> 32:51.758
The dog was with her on Mulholland...

32:51.783 --> 32:53.860
Girl talk. I am so sorry.

32:53.885 --> 32:54.952
Just one sec.

32:56.393 --> 32:57.428
Uh...

32:58.566 --> 33:00.473
Linus said Giorgio hates men,

33:00.498 --> 33:02.129
that he barks like crazy around them.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.378
But in the stitch, the dog wasn't barking.

33:04.403 --> 33:08.060
So whoever was with Bentley,
whoever killed her was a woman.

33:09.064 --> 33:10.532
Everything okay?

33:10.557 --> 33:12.317
No. Um...

33:12.342 --> 33:15.137
Camille and I work at...
we work at a company

33:15.162 --> 33:17.778
that creates video
games, and I just realized

33:17.802 --> 33:19.494
there's a major glitch
in one of the levels.

33:19.519 --> 33:22.389
Mr. Parks is not the
right killer in the game.

33:22.414 --> 33:24.378
Ugh! And we have to go reprogram.

33:24.403 --> 33:25.943
Can dinner wait?

33:25.968 --> 33:27.434
You're going to leave me again?

33:27.459 --> 33:30.506
- It's just a game.
- It's a very important game.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.285
I will loop Cameron and Linus in.

33:34.310 --> 33:36.853
Ah. Seriously... I mean, these boots

33:36.878 --> 33:39.109
are just like... who needs a man?

33:40.856 --> 33:44.777
Who needs a woman when you've got
pizza, beer, and a 4K LED TV?

33:44.971 --> 33:46.948
(Video game noises)

33:47.854 --> 33:50.262
Tell me again why I'm here?

33:52.046 --> 33:55.106
Because it's bro night,
and you're our newest bro.

33:55.131 --> 33:56.458
Yeah.

34:00.458 --> 34:01.878
(Gasps)

34:01.903 --> 34:03.602
Whoa.

34:12.389 --> 34:16.179
Um, how do you spell
"profoundly bad frickin' idea"?

34:16.464 --> 34:19.293
- Just as it sounds.
- How do you know they're not home?

34:19.318 --> 34:21.090
I checked the motion
sensors on the alarm system.

34:21.114 --> 34:22.003
They're out.

34:22.027 --> 34:24.402
Okay, but even if you do find

34:24.428 --> 34:25.978
the gloves you saw the killer wearing,

34:26.004 --> 34:27.706
what are you gonna do? It's
inadmissible as evidence.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.567
Until we tell Maggie where we found them,

34:29.592 --> 34:32.648
then she gets a warrant and
goes in and finds them...

34:32.672 --> 34:33.752
Again...

34:34.177 --> 34:36.623
The gloves will both have Bentley's DNA

34:36.649 --> 34:38.239
and the DNA of the killer on them.

34:38.264 --> 34:39.418
They're the key to this.

34:39.443 --> 34:41.197
Okay, but speaking of
key, what about the alarm?

34:41.222 --> 34:42.509
It's a Secure Assist 200.

34:42.534 --> 34:44.206
I clocked it when I was here with Maggie.

34:44.231 --> 34:46.105
A notoriously easy to hack system.

34:46.130 --> 34:49.797
How notoriously easy
to hack do you think...

34:49.822 --> 34:51.690
- (beeping)
- (Door unlocks)

34:51.716 --> 34:52.838
Nevermind.

35:01.703 --> 35:03.771
Okay. Let's split up.

35:03.796 --> 35:06.099
I'll check the bedroom, you look down here.

35:06.124 --> 35:06.747
Right.

35:08.693 --> 35:10.935
(Yelling) Go, go! Pick up the health pack!

35:10.960 --> 35:13.200
What are you doing? He's right there!

35:13.225 --> 35:17.027
- (Explosion)
- Oh! No! Are you...

35:17.052 --> 35:19.062
That's absolutely incredible!

35:19.087 --> 35:21.089
- Best 27 out of 53?
- Bring it.

35:21.114 --> 35:22.711
Yes.

35:22.736 --> 35:24.004
(Machine gun noises)

35:24.029 --> 35:25.712
To bro night!

35:25.737 --> 35:26.738
Oh!

36:07.241 --> 36:08.997
Ain't nothing downstairs.

36:09.022 --> 36:10.343
Check the drawers in the bedroom.

36:10.366 --> 36:11.214
I'm still in the closet.

36:11.239 --> 36:12.189
(Scoffs)

36:12.214 --> 36:14.606
Not with Liam around you ain't.

36:18.087 --> 36:20.075
Who are you?

36:20.748 --> 36:22.585
I can explain, I think.

36:22.610 --> 36:24.217
How did you get in here?

36:24.242 --> 36:25.276
Smartphone,

36:25.301 --> 36:27.203
not so smart home security system.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.730
Don't move.

36:28.755 --> 36:30.737
I'm calling the police.

36:31.213 --> 36:33.982
And when they get here, you can
tell them how you killed Bentley.

36:34.007 --> 36:36.136
My husband killed that girl.

36:37.928 --> 36:39.797
You're that forensics student.

36:39.822 --> 36:42.435
Your husband is innocent.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.862
You killed Bentley and framed him.

36:44.887 --> 36:47.083
You used his cellphone to text Bentley.

36:47.108 --> 36:49.514
- You can't prove that.
- No. Not yet.

36:49.539 --> 36:53.314
- But I will.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

36:53.339 --> 36:56.362
Your husband didn't
have an affair, you did.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.657
Bentley recorded you.

36:58.682 --> 37:02.082
The woman in the video,
she was wearing this.

37:04.095 --> 37:06.031
That woman was you.

37:06.056 --> 37:08.145
You knew if your husband found out,

37:08.170 --> 37:09.874
he'd dump you, and you
would lose everything.

37:09.899 --> 37:13.702
And you were greedy.
But Bentley was greedier.

37:13.727 --> 37:16.597
And when she upped the
price to turn over the video,

37:16.622 --> 37:18.634
you killed her and
pinned it on your husband.

37:18.659 --> 37:21.435
- (Chuckles)
- (Clears throat)

37:22.860 --> 37:24.610
How much do you girls want?

37:24.635 --> 37:27.306
Because money solves
everything in your world?

37:27.331 --> 37:29.371
Just tell me what you need
to keep your mouths shut.

37:29.379 --> 37:31.131
We don't need anything except this.

37:31.557 --> 37:35.756
My jewelry? Fine. Take it all.

37:35.781 --> 37:38.260
Oh, no. You keep your filthy necklaces,

37:38.285 --> 37:41.188
and your bracelets, and your diamonds.

37:41.213 --> 37:43.165
All I need is this.

37:46.361 --> 37:49.062
And all I need is this.

37:54.395 --> 37:55.830
You okay?

37:55.855 --> 37:57.824
(Music playing)

37:57.849 --> 37:59.150
Need anything else?

37:59.175 --> 38:01.068
- A girlfriend.
- What about Camille?

38:01.093 --> 38:04.827
A reliable girlfriend.
Someone who's not gonna

38:04.852 --> 38:07.083
get all flustered at
the sight of Liam's abs.

38:07.109 --> 38:08.372
Do you want my opinion?

38:08.397 --> 38:09.799
Dating is too much of a hassle.

38:10.785 --> 38:12.471
I know.

38:12.950 --> 38:14.335
I feel you, bro.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.975
You know what I think we need?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.554
A girl-fast. A total break from women.

38:19.445 --> 38:21.739
- Right this second it starts.
- Immediately.

38:21.764 --> 38:23.317
We should work on awakening our Kundalini.

38:23.342 --> 38:24.872
Yeah, we should... we should definitely

38:24.897 --> 38:26.508
awaken whatever that is you just said.

38:26.533 --> 38:29.502
We awaken it and harness our
power by abstaining from sex.

38:29.527 --> 38:31.435
Yeah. No sex.

38:31.460 --> 38:32.851
No sex.

38:32.876 --> 38:36.171
It's not like you guys
are getting any, anyway.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.656
Get out.

38:39.681 --> 38:41.790
♪ Put the pedal to the metal and go ♪

38:41.815 --> 38:43.834
♪ The yellow madellow with
slicks on sending 'em home ♪

38:43.859 --> 38:45.586
♪ Stick cars in the
concrete, gripping the road ♪

38:45.612 --> 38:47.883
♪ So quick, get in the
palm trees, look out, whoa ♪

38:51.957 --> 38:54.384
Next time, you will call someone

38:54.409 --> 38:55.939
before going out on your own.

38:55.964 --> 38:56.937
Totally.

38:56.962 --> 39:00.129
And despite your slight
errors in logistical judgment,

39:00.154 --> 39:01.648
good job.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.393
Thanks.

39:03.418 --> 39:05.178
I'm gonna grab our things.

39:05.203 --> 39:06.564
Okay, third time's the charm.

39:06.589 --> 39:08.791
Enough of a good job to
warrant, say, a raise?

39:08.816 --> 39:11.533
You've earned it in more ways than one.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.080
So how much do you want?

39:13.105 --> 39:14.806
Hold please.

39:17.879 --> 39:19.747
(Chuckling)

39:19.772 --> 39:21.177
Done.

39:21.202 --> 39:22.909
- Wait, can I add a zero?
- Don't push it.

39:31.271 --> 39:33.202
So what did you find on Liam?

39:33.766 --> 39:36.217
Camille thoroughly vetted his credentials.

39:36.242 --> 39:37.664
They all checked out.

39:37.688 --> 39:39.213
Perfectly.

39:40.206 --> 39:41.374
Too perfectly?

39:41.399 --> 39:42.934
A year ago, Liam was awarded

39:42.959 --> 39:47.232
an N.S.F. post-doctoral fellowship
in emerging third world cultures.

39:47.257 --> 39:50.147
- Impressive.
- And worrisome.

39:52.613 --> 39:56.245
Here's a picture of
him receiving the award.

40:01.858 --> 40:03.165
You think it's him.

40:03.191 --> 40:04.559
It's hard to tell from the picture,

40:04.584 --> 40:07.721
but my gut says, "yes," and
if there is even a chance...

40:10.002 --> 40:11.773
Flash drive.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.503
I'll take care of it, you...

40:14.528 --> 40:16.685
I'll keep an eye on Liam.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.793
(Door closes)

40:35.503 --> 40:37.035
What's that?

40:39.983 --> 40:42.779
- Key to something.
- Key to what?

40:43.053 --> 40:44.677
I'm not quite sure yet.

40:44.702 --> 40:46.116
(Laughs)

40:46.141 --> 40:50.712
Kirsten Clark, you continue to
be an unexpected mystery to me.

40:50.883 --> 40:52.807
A beautiful one, though.

40:53.230 --> 40:56.264
I mean it, Kirsten.

40:56.289 --> 40:57.590
You're beautiful.

40:57.615 --> 40:59.984
Just like this. No layers of makeup,

41:00.009 --> 41:02.025
no fancy dresses...

41:02.795 --> 41:04.330
Just you.

41:04.355 --> 41:06.015
Thank you.

41:07.559 --> 41:10.195
You may not feel it they
way I do when we're apart,

41:10.220 --> 41:14.039
but I know how right it
feels when we're together.

41:14.064 --> 41:15.903
Me too.

41:20.702 --> 41:22.832
Will you marry me?

41:27.741 --> 41:32.741
