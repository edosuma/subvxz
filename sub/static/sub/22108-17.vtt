Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Boywatch"</font>

00:20.472 --> 00:23.722
Whoa, the beach is littered
with tourists... and litter.

00:23.833 --> 00:25.621
Who just lays
on a blanket all day?

00:25.698 --> 00:27.513
Yeah, give your couch another try!

00:27.600 --> 00:29.659
- Couches are wonderful!
- Totally.

00:29.731 --> 00:32.531
And I hate how the water
makes the sand stick to your...

00:33.933 --> 00:35.593
Sugar cookies!

00:35.995 --> 00:37.404
Skin.

00:37.932 --> 00:40.566
That's... a lot of contact.

00:41.025 --> 00:44.944
Good idea. We should
go in for a closer look.

00:45.390 --> 00:47.759
Hey. Hi. We were just wondering
why you're rolling around

00:47.827 --> 00:49.805
in the sand like that? On
each other? No judgment.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.038
- We're doing sugar cookies.
- Sugar cookies?

00:52.122 --> 00:54.017
The sand's the sugar,
we're the cookies.

00:54.085 --> 00:56.511
Listen, pal, if sand
was sugar, I'd know it.

00:56.579 --> 00:59.386
It's a cool way for the squad
to bond. And warm up.

00:59.454 --> 01:01.619
The squad? What kind
of squad is it anyway?

01:01.687 --> 01:03.612
Just curious about
squads, mainly this one.

01:03.744 --> 01:05.944
- We're junior lifeguards.
- We get to do several

01:06.012 --> 01:08.029
of the same drills actual lifeguards do.

01:08.097 --> 01:10.488
And when we graduate, our
squad's picture will go

01:10.556 --> 01:12.975
on the wall of honor in
the lifeguard station.

01:13.094 --> 01:15.167
Just above the copier. So...

01:15.257 --> 01:17.559
- Wow.
- Well, thank you for you service

01:17.694 --> 01:19.927
to our beach,
to yourselves.

01:20.546 --> 01:22.556
Hydrate, snack, sunscreen!

01:24.777 --> 01:27.544
So... how does one
become a junior lifeguard?

01:27.616 --> 01:30.556
Well, you got to love, but
also respect, the beach.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.149
That's so funny. I was just saying

01:32.217 --> 01:33.758
how much I love, but
also respect

01:33.826 --> 01:34.945
- the beach.
- Ha!

01:35.013 --> 01:36.682
You got to be a strong
open ocean swimmer,

01:36.750 --> 01:39.017
you got to thrive in a
disciplined environment,

01:39.085 --> 01:40.384
and you got to enjoy hard work.

01:40.452 --> 01:42.437
- It's like you people know me.
- Hmm?

01:42.505 --> 01:43.689
So where do I sign up?

01:43.757 --> 01:45.206
Sign-ups were last week.

01:45.293 --> 01:47.272
Kelly's right.
This session already started,

01:47.340 --> 01:48.518
and we're at capacity.

01:48.601 --> 01:50.581
Thanks for the helpful
bit of info, Kelly.

01:50.649 --> 01:53.458
No prob. Hey, Michael,
want me to get your back?

01:53.526 --> 01:55.092
Sure, and I'll get your back.

01:55.211 --> 01:57.594
So much contact.

01:57.678 --> 01:59.444
Partner up for the buoy swim!

02:01.295 --> 02:03.464
You can always sign up
for the next session.

02:03.532 --> 02:05.051
- When's that?
- Next year!

02:05.126 --> 02:07.503
Next year? That's in,
like, a million years!

02:07.637 --> 02:10.257
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

02:10.376 --> 02:12.005
I fell in a dumb hole!

02:12.085 --> 02:13.433
- Kelly, don't move, girl.
- Ow!

02:13.501 --> 02:15.289
- We're looking at a grade three sprain.
- Ow!

02:15.357 --> 02:16.652
- Ooh!
- Aah!

02:16.720 --> 02:18.650
- But that'll take weeks to heal!
- It's true.

02:18.718 --> 02:20.394
And by then,
this session will be over.

02:20.462 --> 02:23.778
Oh, my God. I wish I never
even had stupid ankles.

02:23.923 --> 02:25.990
Parker, Willow,
help her to the station.

02:26.084 --> 02:28.024
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

02:28.092 --> 02:30.384
Why don't stupid people
fill in holes?

02:30.452 --> 02:32.361
Speaking of filling
in, since Kelly's out,

02:32.429 --> 02:33.938
does that mean
I can fill in for her?

02:34.006 --> 02:35.531
Huh. Let me think about that.

02:35.707 --> 02:37.590
Mm. Let me ask you this.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.341
Why do you want to
be a junior lifeguard?

02:39.441 --> 02:43.090
I want to be a junior
lifeguard because...

02:43.349 --> 02:45.591
Ah.

02:45.723 --> 02:48.016
Because I love the beach, I'm
a very, very strong swimmer,

02:48.138 --> 02:49.240
I'm super into discipline,

02:49.308 --> 02:50.706
and I've always wanted
to be a lifeguard.

02:50.773 --> 02:52.505
Yup, all true.
You can check my journal.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.248
Uh, can we get
the Wi-Fi password?

02:55.316 --> 02:56.875
The-the Wi-Fi
password?

02:56.943 --> 02:59.684
Yeah, for the network
"Kids Trapped Send Help."

02:59.752 --> 03:02.029
Oh, uh, that's my
family's Wi-Fi network.

03:02.097 --> 03:04.398
My-my kids named it that.
They're not really trapped.

03:04.466 --> 03:06.006
I just don't know how to change it.

03:06.074 --> 03:08.584
Uh, pretty sure it's
pronounced "wiffy," right?

03:08.652 --> 03:10.035
Dude, it's "Wi-Fi."

03:10.103 --> 03:12.033
I think... I mean, I think it's "Wi-Fi."

03:12.101 --> 03:13.887
Are we sure? Everyone's
in agreement

03:13.955 --> 03:15.530
-  it's "Wi-Fi"?
- Yeah.

03:15.598 --> 03:17.490
Well, I'm gonna keep
calling it "wiffy" in

03:17.558 --> 03:19.078
my head. Can't stop
me from doing that.

03:19.146 --> 03:20.784
So, can I get the password?

03:20.852 --> 03:23.326
Right, but it's my family's
personal home network

03:23.394 --> 03:25.191
for upstairs family use, so...

03:25.259 --> 03:27.572
Should we go across the street?
I'm pretty sure they have Wi-Fi.

03:27.639 --> 03:30.477
The password is "dadsbald,"
all lowercase one word.

03:30.545 --> 03:32.007
- Lin!
- Great. Thank you.

03:32.077 --> 03:34.542
Bob, people expect to
have Wi-Fi nowadays.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.412
Free Wi-Fi is this generation's
free pens at the bank.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.676
Those pens aren't free, Lin.

03:38.753 --> 03:40.588
You have to break the
chain to get the pen.

03:40.656 --> 03:43.424
Yeah, it's easy. -But maybe
free Wi-Fi is good for business.

03:43.492 --> 03:45.755
- That guy falls.
- Except for Teddy,

03:45.823 --> 03:48.643
- using it here for that.
- Oh, that's got to hurt.

03:49.459 --> 03:50.864
Everyone, out of the water!

03:50.932 --> 03:52.074
Why am I saying that, you ask?

03:52.141 --> 03:54.517
- No. I mean, yes.
- Because I am...

03:54.585 --> 03:55.770
As soon as you sign this fun

03:55.838 --> 03:57.403
and mostly filled-out
permission form...

03:57.480 --> 03:59.672
The newest member of the
famous Junior Lifeguards.

03:59.749 --> 04:01.629
- So famous.
- So junior.

04:01.764 --> 04:04.268
Um, Tina, should we
work on your swimming?

04:04.345 --> 04:06.786
I remember you not knowing
how to do that... so great.

04:06.854 --> 04:08.570
- Don't write that.
- It's fine. She floats.

04:08.637 --> 04:10.721
- It's like me. We're floaters.
- All right.

04:10.789 --> 04:13.102
Just when you thought it was
safe to go back in the water.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.960
- Ow.
- It's not.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.723
All right, gang, it's time to
officially welcome Tina here

04:19.791 --> 04:21.815
- into the Junior Lifeguards.
- Thanks, Zack.

04:21.892 --> 04:24.498
Couple things about me... I
go to school, I live at home.

04:24.566 --> 04:26.007
And I swim really,
really well.

04:26.075 --> 04:27.483
Okay, cool. Thanks a lot, Tina.

04:27.551 --> 04:28.890
Oh, and I'm pretty single
right now.

04:28.967 --> 04:30.588
I believe you guys were
wondering about that earlier.

04:30.655 --> 04:32.869
All right, time to
stretch out, everybody.

04:32.946 --> 04:34.573
Look, I know
I'm only here

04:34.641 --> 04:36.438
because Kelly had that
super embarrassing fall.

04:36.506 --> 04:39.167
Yes, I'm taking her place,
but I'm not the new Kelly.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.107
Michael, whatever you had
with Kelly

04:41.175 --> 04:42.555
doesn't just mean you have that with me.

04:42.622 --> 04:44.690
No, yeah, I-I know... that...

04:44.758 --> 04:45.921
Unless it does.

04:45.989 --> 04:48.042
Tina, less talking, more stretching!

04:48.126 --> 04:51.027
Sorry! Hey, how about some of
us start a second row back here?

04:51.095 --> 04:52.979
Uh, this is too much, actually.

04:53.058 --> 04:56.102
- I'm coming back.
- Tina, stop messing around!

04:56.664 --> 04:58.964
All right, guys, let's
set up for a paddle relay.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.101
Or we dive right into sugar cookies?

05:01.174 --> 05:03.024
Some of us haven't done that yet?

05:03.101 --> 05:06.069
All right, that's it. Drop
and give me 20. Everybody!

05:06.137 --> 05:08.998
- Why everybody?
- Because, Parker, this is a squad.

05:09.066 --> 05:12.302
You sink or swim, or save
sinking swimmers as a squad.

05:13.679 --> 05:15.306
Thanks a lot, Tina.

05:15.505 --> 05:18.356
High step, high step and...
dolphin dive!

05:18.445 --> 05:20.447
- Great dolphin, Willow.
- Thanks!

05:20.515 --> 05:22.163
Tina, you're the last one.

05:22.231 --> 05:24.200
Okay. Wow that's cold.

05:24.268 --> 05:26.222
This is gonna take me a
few minutes to ease in.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.105
Run! Now! Go!

05:28.182 --> 05:29.673
Aah! Aah!

05:31.288 --> 05:32.930
That's enough of the water for me today.

05:32.998 --> 05:34.863
Are there some indoor drills
we can do?

05:35.243 --> 05:36.805
- We're startin' over!
- What?!

05:36.882 --> 05:38.254
The squad does not finish

05:38.322 --> 05:40.537
until everyone can
get past the breakers.

05:40.605 --> 05:43.292
- So unfair!
- Huh. If ever there was a time

05:43.360 --> 05:45.618
to do sugar cookies,
am I right?

05:45.686 --> 05:48.601
Who wants to show me the proper
rhythm for chest compressions

05:48.669 --> 05:50.277
on Can't Breathe-y Stevie here?

05:50.345 --> 05:51.978
Jason, you ready to shine, bro?

05:52.046 --> 05:54.319
So, what do you think of Jason?
I'm pretty sure he's into you.

05:54.386 --> 05:57.401
- Jason's my brother.
- Oh. I was wondering

05:57.478 --> 05:59.379
why you both said "Bye,
Mom" to the same lady.

05:59.456 --> 06:01.134
Still, there's something there.

06:01.513 --> 06:04.504
So, whatcha writing?
A novel?

06:04.591 --> 06:07.369
What? Oh, no, just
catching up on e-mail.

06:07.446 --> 06:10.935
Ooh, is it an e-mail to your
publisher about your novel?

06:11.003 --> 06:13.680
No. I-It's about the
kids' soccer schedule.

06:13.752 --> 06:14.752
Oh.

06:15.587 --> 06:17.888
I can't believe we didn't
think of free Wi-Fi before.

06:17.965 --> 06:19.560
It's busy, but calm.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.750
Everyone's happy just
staring at their screens.

06:21.827 --> 06:23.585
Yeah, but I thought
it'd be different.

06:23.662 --> 06:25.906
Like, creative people,
writing the next big thing,

06:25.994 --> 06:27.122
free-flowing ideas.

06:27.199 --> 06:29.529
Instead it's just e-mail
and online shopping,

06:29.597 --> 06:32.342
and whatever that guy's
watching and crying about.

06:32.410 --> 06:34.027
Uh, it's the British Baking Show.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.948
Yeah, some old guy made a Swiss roll

06:36.016 --> 06:38.266
that made me feel something, for once.

06:38.352 --> 06:41.376
It's weird that this is how
they choose the prime minister.

06:41.613 --> 06:44.021
There's my little Tina-la Anderson.

06:44.089 --> 06:46.425
Was your first day at the
beach a day at the beach?

06:46.493 --> 06:49.210
Ugh, I'm tired,
but also exhilarated.

06:49.369 --> 06:50.979
So, what did we learn?

06:51.056 --> 06:52.924
Well, we learned that Michael
and Kelly are still texting

06:52.991 --> 06:54.822
each other even though she's
not in Junior Guards anymore.

06:54.889 --> 06:56.580
Which is fine. Love
triangles are pretty common

06:56.647 --> 06:57.819
in JGs, I think.

06:57.896 --> 07:00.630
Right, but did you learn
anything about life-guarding,

07:00.707 --> 07:01.957
or swimming?

07:02.034 --> 07:03.681
Geez, Dad, give the girl a break.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.004
She's probably exhausted

07:05.083 --> 07:06.919
from staring at all
those lifeguard butts.

07:07.006 --> 07:09.565
- Oh, my God.
- Well, I'm gonna go rest up.

07:09.652 --> 07:12.809
Tomorrow is another big day of
drama on the beach, starring me.

07:12.886 --> 07:15.178
♪ Beach drama ♪

07:15.255 --> 07:18.807
♪ Beach drama, whoa ♪

07:18.884 --> 07:22.356
♪ Beach drama, beach drama ♪

07:22.475 --> 07:24.035
♪ Can't Breathe-y Stevie ♪

07:24.103 --> 07:26.559
♪ Ooh, ooh ♪

07:26.765 --> 07:29.326
♪ Beach drama. ♪

07:31.163 --> 07:34.042
When you're done cleaning
the boards, you can go.

07:34.177 --> 07:36.075
And I hope it's as un-fun as
it looks.

07:36.143 --> 07:38.269
It is un-fun.
And it's messed up

07:38.337 --> 07:40.525
that we're all punished when
only one of us is messing up.

07:40.592 --> 07:42.231
Well, it might be "messed up,"

07:42.299 --> 07:44.483
but it's how we do things
in Junior Guards, gang.

07:44.571 --> 07:46.981
That person you're referring
to needs to think long and hard

07:47.049 --> 07:48.479
about why she's here.

07:48.547 --> 07:50.994
And that she can quit at any time.

07:51.062 --> 07:52.789
'Cause if this continues,
I'm not so sure

07:52.857 --> 07:54.676
this squad is gonna graduate
next week.

07:54.753 --> 07:56.450
- Jeesh, what's his problem?
- You.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.256
- You're the problem.
- Yeah. Just quit, Tina.

07:59.324 --> 08:02.145
Okay, I-I think we all just
need to cool down and lotion up.

08:02.213 --> 08:03.386
Want me to get your back, Michael?

08:03.453 --> 08:04.911
No, I don't want you to get my back.

08:04.979 --> 08:06.291
I just want to get through
one day

08:06.358 --> 08:07.722
without you getting us in trouble.

08:07.841 --> 08:09.239
Ouch.

08:09.383 --> 08:11.742
Tina, why are you even
here? You're not JGM.

08:11.812 --> 08:13.229
What's JGM?

08:13.388 --> 08:15.306
Junior Guard Material.

08:15.374 --> 08:16.865
Face it, Tina, you're a screw-up.

08:16.939 --> 08:18.362
But I'm the lovable screw-up.
We all have our roles.

08:18.429 --> 08:21.856
He's the hot one, he's also
the hot one. You guys get it.

08:21.924 --> 08:25.022
Tina, Zack, Jason and Parker are right.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.825
Mm, I think Willow said it, too.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.245
You should really think
about quitting.

08:28.312 --> 08:30.770
- Yeah.
- Oh, if that's how you all feel,

08:30.997 --> 08:34.034
then, fine, I guess I'll quit.

08:34.111 --> 08:36.436
What was that, Michael? I should
stay? I'm the quiet leader?

08:36.503 --> 08:37.861
Did not say anything.

08:37.938 --> 08:40.486
Oh. So, n-no one's gonna stop me?

08:40.876 --> 08:41.962
Fine.

08:42.070 --> 08:44.077
I'm gonna turn in my whistle and can.

08:46.492 --> 08:48.029
Bob, have you seen that video

08:48.106 --> 08:49.931
where the monkey
falls out of the tree

08:50.008 --> 08:51.625
after he smells his
stinky finger?

08:51.744 --> 08:53.398
Take your headphones off, Teddy.
You're talking way too loud.

08:53.465 --> 08:55.415
Yeah, he scratches his butt,
then he smells his finger,

08:55.482 --> 08:57.657
then he falls right out of the tree.

08:57.725 --> 08:59.662
Oh, I'm not doing it justice.
I can't describe it.

08:59.729 --> 09:01.035
- Y-You got to see it for yourself.
- Teddy!

09:01.102 --> 09:02.360
- Take your head...
- No, I'm just gonna forward it

09:02.427 --> 09:03.573
- to you.
- Ugh. Forget it.

09:03.641 --> 09:04.812
Here's your order.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.313
In the mouth, headed south.

09:06.381 --> 09:07.428
Ha, ha!

09:07.496 --> 09:08.887
Nothing? Really?

09:09.019 --> 09:10.392
You're not gonna look
up from the screen,

09:10.459 --> 09:11.756
even with me talking to you now?

09:11.824 --> 09:14.140
Hello? I put poison
in your fries.

09:14.311 --> 09:17.107
Okay, that's it. That's
enough screen time, people!

09:17.175 --> 09:18.416
Let's all take a ten-minute break.

09:18.483 --> 09:20.305
- Lin.
- Okay, I'm going upstairs

09:20.373 --> 09:22.054
- to unplug the router.
- No, no, no, Lin.

09:22.122 --> 09:23.947
The Wi-Fi has been good
for business.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.757
It's good for business,
but bad for humans.

09:26.826 --> 09:28.866
I don't want to live in a
world where people don't look up

09:28.933 --> 09:31.394
and smile at me when
I say hilarious stuff.

09:33.513 --> 09:35.871
Aw. Not you, too, Sergeant Bosco.

09:36.020 --> 09:38.301
Shush, shh, shh. Shut up.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.682
Don't say my name.

09:39.750 --> 09:40.966
I'm undercover.

09:41.034 --> 09:43.579
Um, but your badge is right there.

09:43.647 --> 09:44.863
Damn it. Don't look at me.

09:44.931 --> 09:46.612
Just act normal and
pretend I'm a customer.

09:46.709 --> 09:50.424
Uh, what would you like to
eat today, Sergeant Customer?

09:50.501 --> 09:53.698
I'll, uh, have, uh... mm, a coffee.

09:53.766 --> 09:55.758
- Very natural.
- Shush!

09:55.965 --> 09:57.336
Um, why
are you undercover?

09:57.404 --> 10:00.300
I'm investigating cyber
robberies, that's why.

10:00.378 --> 10:01.469
Hence the shorts.

10:01.658 --> 10:04.078
Some scumbag on your
Wi-Fi network

10:04.146 --> 10:05.325
is hacking into people's computers

10:05.392 --> 10:06.950
and stealing identities
and credit card numbers

10:07.017 --> 10:10.063
and buying some really
dumb stuff online.

10:10.293 --> 10:11.315
Who is it?

10:11.383 --> 10:14.150
If I knew that, I wouldn't
be undercover, would I?

10:14.325 --> 10:17.371
Um, it says "police" on
the back of your shirt.

10:17.490 --> 10:18.758
Got-dangit!

10:18.826 --> 10:20.700
Bob,
change shirts with me.

10:20.850 --> 10:21.906
Um, no.

10:21.974 --> 10:24.467
So someone in the restaurant
is a computer hacker, huh?

10:24.635 --> 10:26.227
Well, it's something.

10:26.304 --> 10:27.454
Okay, I'm in.

10:27.522 --> 10:29.018
What do you...
what do you mean, you're in?

10:29.085 --> 10:30.842
I'm in. Let's go,
let's do it, baby.

10:30.910 --> 10:32.224
- What?
- Is it him?

10:32.301 --> 10:33.733
- Is it her? Is it... is it her?
- Her what? -Is it him?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.257
- What are you talking about? No.
- Is it him?

10:35.324 --> 10:36.721
- Not... No. Is it that one?
- GENE: Him.

10:36.788 --> 10:38.742
- What about that one?
- I don't know. Shh!

10:38.826 --> 10:40.333
You shush.
We're helping.

10:40.401 --> 10:41.617
Yeah. Uh-huh.

10:41.717 --> 10:43.745
Okay. Sure.
Yeah, we can make

10:43.813 --> 10:46.142
the fun run a 3K instead
of a 2K this year.

10:46.302 --> 10:48.042
Yeah, another K is no prob.

10:48.207 --> 10:50.128
Okay, look, I got to go.
The other line's ringing.

10:50.195 --> 10:51.876
Lifeguard station, this is Zack.

10:51.953 --> 10:53.411
Uh-huh,
mm-hmm,

10:53.488 --> 10:56.159
you want to move the sand castle
contest to south of the pier?

10:56.227 --> 10:59.181
I bet you can't wait to get
up on that wall of honor.

10:59.306 --> 11:01.292
I'm not going up on the wall.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.144
Sure you are.
You're a Junior Lifeguard, ain't ya?

11:04.212 --> 11:05.648
Not for much longer.

11:05.724 --> 11:07.205
I'm turning in my whistle and my can.

11:07.273 --> 11:08.841
What?! I can't think of a reason

11:08.909 --> 11:11.405
anyone would want to
leave the Junior Guards.

11:11.473 --> 11:12.987
The truth is, I only signed up

11:13.055 --> 11:14.551
to be around shirtless, teen boys.

11:14.619 --> 11:16.420
Oh. Yeah, maybe quit then.

11:16.527 --> 11:18.195
You might not be JGM.

11:18.263 --> 11:20.456
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, but really,

11:20.524 --> 11:22.744
I think everyone is
right. I should quit.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.294
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

11:24.362 --> 11:26.332
But it doesn't feel right to quit.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.597
Tina Belcher isn't a quitter.

11:27.692 --> 11:28.943
But maybe she should be?

11:29.011 --> 11:30.491
Quitting is liberating

11:30.559 --> 11:32.376
and could be the way to go.

11:32.444 --> 11:35.044
That's right, Mr. Old Man,
quitting is not the way to go.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.168
I might've joined Junior
Guards for the wrong reasons,

11:37.318 --> 11:39.152
but I'm gonna finish
it for the right ones.

11:39.274 --> 11:41.589
Sure. Later. Yeah,
Tina, what do you need?

11:41.680 --> 11:43.516
- I came in here to quit...
- Oh, okay, cool.

11:43.593 --> 11:46.252
But a wise, old, wrinkly
man convinced me otherwise.

11:46.329 --> 11:48.874
- Ugh, Gus.
- I swear, I didn't mean to.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.670
Also, "wrinkly"? No.

11:50.789 --> 11:53.592
I've taken very good care of my skin.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.794
So, I quit on quitting.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.290
I'm gonna graduate Junior Guards

11:57.358 --> 11:59.170
and I'm getting on
that wall right there.

11:59.447 --> 12:01.855
Uh, not that wall. That's
the missing person's wall.

12:01.923 --> 12:03.087
Um, that wall.

12:05.802 --> 12:07.874
I can't believe you unquit, Tina.

12:07.942 --> 12:09.769
Now we're never gonna
graduate Junior Guards.

12:09.846 --> 12:12.092
Look, we all just need to
give me a second chance.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.439
I promise I'm gonna work hard

12:13.516 --> 12:14.982
and I'll keep my eyes on the thighs.

12:15.059 --> 12:16.375
I mean, prize.

12:16.452 --> 12:18.344
Partner up for the buoy swim.

12:18.493 --> 12:20.388
So cold! High step! Aah! High step!

12:20.465 --> 12:21.756
And...

12:25.652 --> 12:27.562
I did it. I-I dolphined.

12:27.639 --> 12:28.782
Eh.

12:31.602 --> 12:34.553
Well, it wasn't
the prettiest buoy swim

12:34.621 --> 12:36.652
and it looked like you swallowed
a lot of water out there...

12:36.719 --> 12:38.208
All the water.
But you did it

12:38.276 --> 12:39.913
without
needing to be rescued.

12:39.981 --> 12:41.697
- Nice job, Tina.
- Thank you.

12:41.765 --> 12:43.679
It's the bare minimum,
but you did it.

12:43.810 --> 12:44.958
Thanks again.

12:45.586 --> 12:47.491
Are you close to
finding the cyber crook?

12:47.559 --> 12:49.415
No, no, I'm using
some new program

12:49.485 --> 12:51.544
to trace the hack back
to the source computer,

12:51.621 --> 12:53.848
but I'm-I'm no good at this
tech stuff. I'm terrible.

12:53.916 --> 12:55.307
Maybe hit the keys harder?

12:55.396 --> 12:56.807
Wait a minute.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.017
My Laptop.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.185
"My Laptop"?

12:59.262 --> 13:00.895
Yeah, it's the name of a computer

13:00.972 --> 13:02.453
that's initiating the attack.

13:02.521 --> 13:05.143
Which one of you is My Laptop?

13:05.211 --> 13:07.419
So, we're looking
for someone with a lap.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.490
I'm on it.

13:08.558 --> 13:09.991
No, no, get back here. Damn it.

13:10.059 --> 13:12.177
He's the best in the
business. You're in good hands.

13:12.304 --> 13:14.496
- I forgot what I was looking for.
- My turn.

13:14.564 --> 13:18.334
Don't mind me, I'm just a
little girl lost in a restaurant.

13:18.429 --> 13:20.177
Are you my mommy?

13:20.543 --> 13:22.592
Are you my mommy?

13:22.685 --> 13:24.619
You know, your children are awful.

13:24.696 --> 13:26.064
No, I-I know.

13:31.835 --> 13:33.094
Ah, thanks, everybody.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.078
- Whatever.
- What's that, Parker?

13:35.155 --> 13:36.339
You might have everyone else fooled,

13:36.406 --> 13:38.298
but I still think
you shouldn't be on this squad.

13:38.365 --> 13:39.483
Ugh, come on, Parker.

13:39.551 --> 13:40.985
Tina is really trying.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.937
She hasn't gotten us
in trouble in days.

13:43.014 --> 13:45.231
Yeah, and I'm keeping the
chest glances to a minimum.

13:45.308 --> 13:47.233
And I'm not even thinking
about the love triangle

13:47.310 --> 13:48.444
I'm in with Michael and Kelly.

13:48.511 --> 13:49.598
We're not in a love triangle.

13:49.665 --> 13:50.775
Yes, we are.
We're handling it.

13:50.842 --> 13:53.000
You really think she could
save your life out there?

13:53.073 --> 13:55.531
You'd be willing to put
your life in Tina's hands?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.610
- Um... definitely no.
- Mm, I guess not.

13:57.687 --> 13:59.174
- That's what I thought.
- Guys, come on.

13:59.241 --> 14:01.499
I'm real deal JGM.
I'll prove it to you.

14:01.567 --> 14:04.159
What if, um, I-I did the
open ocean rescue drill?

14:04.268 --> 14:07.286
Tina, that's not a JG
drill, that's an LG drill.

14:07.363 --> 14:09.589
- Right. What's LG again?
- Lifeguard.

14:09.666 --> 14:12.291
Right, right, right.
But I can still do it. I can.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.712
A-And, you know what, if
I can't, then I'll quit.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.820
I just need one of you to
volunteer to be my victim.

14:16.926 --> 14:19.375
I mean, to be rescued. Fine.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.830
I think I know where
I can find a volunteer.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.273
What do you say,
Can't Breathe-y Stevie?

14:25.341 --> 14:27.151
Want to go for a little swim?

14:29.759 --> 14:31.292
Tina, you can do this.

14:31.362 --> 14:32.571
I think, maybe.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.366
Dolphin dive.

14:40.595 --> 14:42.897
Come on, Stevie, let's show
these guys that I can...

14:42.974 --> 14:44.665
Oh, God, you're heavy.

14:45.835 --> 14:47.902
She's doing it, sort of.

14:48.162 --> 14:50.363
Are you absorbing water?
Please, don't do that.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.927
- Looks like she's gonna make it.
- I can't believe it.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.436
Remain calm. Help has arrived.

14:57.513 --> 15:00.940
Wait a second, is that Ti...
Tina and Can't Breathe-y Stevie?

15:01.017 --> 15:02.182
What are you doing out here, Stevie?

15:02.249 --> 15:03.254
Oh, hi, Zack.

15:03.354 --> 15:04.692
You come here, too? No way.

15:04.762 --> 15:05.678
Okay. Bye.

15:05.755 --> 15:07.054
So, let me get this straight.

15:07.131 --> 15:08.857
You snuck into the equipment shed,

15:08.934 --> 15:10.616
you stole poor Stevie here,

15:10.684 --> 15:13.002
dropped him into the ocean...
Probably ruining him...

15:13.070 --> 15:16.222
And attempted to perform a
non-sanctioned LG rescue drill?

15:16.299 --> 15:18.340
- Did I miss anything?
- You missed the part

15:18.408 --> 15:20.324
where I was about to
complete an open ocean rescue

15:20.391 --> 15:22.410
to prove to the rest of the
Junior Guards that I belong.

15:22.477 --> 15:23.602
Let me stop you right there.

15:23.670 --> 15:25.606
You don't.
None of you do.

15:25.683 --> 15:27.166
In the 58 weeks

15:27.243 --> 15:29.098
that I've been lead
instructor of Junior Guards,

15:29.165 --> 15:31.245
I've never had to do
this, but guess what?

15:31.322 --> 15:32.446
You're all kicked out.

15:32.523 --> 15:34.040
- What? -
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:34.117 --> 15:37.258
You break the rules as a squad,
you get kicked out as a squad.

15:37.326 --> 15:38.886
You're dismissed forever.

15:38.963 --> 15:40.579
- -Ugh.
- Oh, boy, um...

15:40.695 --> 15:43.200
should we exchange
info and stay in touch?

15:43.268 --> 15:44.483
- Ugh.
- Plan a reunion?

15:44.550 --> 15:45.881
- Okay, everyone is crying.
- Unbelievable.

15:45.948 --> 15:47.893
We can maybe regroup later.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.355
Sorry, Junior Guards of yesteryear.

15:50.482 --> 15:52.133
Don't say sorry to them.

15:52.210 --> 15:54.678
Say sorry to Stevie. He's dead.

15:57.601 --> 15:59.308
Aw, poor baby.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.545
You know, there are a million
junior lifeguard programs

16:01.613 --> 16:03.898
in the sea. You'll find another one.

16:03.966 --> 16:05.737
No, this is the only one in the area.

16:05.891 --> 16:08.784
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.

16:08.852 --> 16:11.276
Yeah, sorry, Tina. I know how
much fun you were having

16:11.353 --> 16:13.789
being around boys
not wearing shirts.

16:13.857 --> 16:15.135
But it was more than that.

16:15.346 --> 16:17.456
I really was loving
being a Junior Guard,

16:17.524 --> 16:19.442
being part of a squad
that meant something.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.579
At least you get to keep
that sweet, sweet whistle.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.511
Oh, no, I got to bring it back tomorrow.

16:23.586 --> 16:25.907
Well, play us something before
you bring it back, will you?

16:26.400 --> 16:27.473
Ma-Maybe not. Maybe not.

16:27.550 --> 16:28.974
I-It's a little shrill.

16:29.042 --> 16:30.902
- You let Mom talk.
- What?!

16:36.986 --> 16:39.007
I let you all down.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.923
I really thought I
belonged up there with you.

16:41.050 --> 16:43.197
Well, good-bye, lifeguard station.

16:43.432 --> 16:45.450
Good-bye, beach.
Good-bye, litter.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.340
Good-bye, sand castle contest.

16:47.467 --> 16:49.595
Good-bye, 3K fun run. Wait.

16:49.772 --> 16:51.805
What the... the fun
run is on the same day

16:51.882 --> 16:53.540
as the sand castle contest?

16:53.709 --> 16:55.818
And the lifeguards are
tending to a level orange,

16:55.886 --> 16:58.814
real-world, Jet Ski reprimand. Oh, no.

16:59.817 --> 17:02.063
Guys, we have a situation.

17:02.131 --> 17:03.510
Why are you wearing that like that?

17:03.577 --> 17:04.768
Because of the situation.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.271
What are you talking about?

17:06.339 --> 17:08.290
Some idiot scheduled a 3K fun run

17:08.358 --> 17:09.944
on the same day as the
sand castle contest.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.771
- So what?
- "So what"?

17:11.862 --> 17:14.165
Willow, the fun runners are
running into a death trap

17:14.233 --> 17:15.241
for their ankles.

17:15.318 --> 17:16.444
See for yourself.

17:16.515 --> 17:17.609
The finish line

17:17.686 --> 17:19.782
is just past the sand
castle competition.

17:19.859 --> 17:21.247
Castles, moats, holes,

17:21.324 --> 17:22.544
and runners headed
straight towards them!

17:22.611 --> 17:24.873
If we don't do something, those
sprained ankles are gonna be on us.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.599
What can we do? We're not even
Junior Lifeguards anymore.

17:27.704 --> 17:29.846
Should we call it in?
Tell the real lifeguards?

17:29.961 --> 17:31.434
They're busy. It's up to us.

17:31.530 --> 17:33.360
We've been trained to deal
with this situation, right?

17:33.427 --> 17:35.599
- Not exactly.
- But pretty close.

17:35.675 --> 17:37.667
- I mean, kind of.
- That's the spirit.

17:37.736 --> 17:39.128
Look, I know
there's been some drama

17:39.195 --> 17:40.625
and I know you all think it's my fault

17:40.692 --> 17:41.812
we got kicked out of Junior Guards...

17:41.879 --> 17:42.992
- It was.
- Totally was.

17:43.069 --> 17:44.786
Uh, right, yeah, sure, possibly.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.961
But right now, we got to put
our issues aside, put our love

17:47.028 --> 17:49.398
- triangle on hold, Michael...
- There's no love triangle.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.726
Okay, fine. Love square.
Looking at you, Jason. - What?

17:51.803 --> 17:53.697
And we go out there and
save some innocent ankles.

17:53.764 --> 17:55.161
Now, who's with me?

17:55.229 --> 17:57.145
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

17:57.225 --> 17:58.560
Let's do this.

18:05.483 --> 18:07.227
Aah!

18:14.159 --> 18:16.084
Faster. Hurry.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.827
The fun runners are almost here.

18:22.968 --> 18:26.669
No.

18:27.369 --> 18:28.902
Aah!

18:32.978 --> 18:35.921
Sergeant Bosco, you're
not undercover anymore?

18:35.989 --> 18:36.953
No more shorts?

18:37.021 --> 18:38.588
Yeah, no more shorts,
probably ever.

18:38.656 --> 18:40.166
Girl, say it ain't true.

18:40.234 --> 18:41.413
So, you got the guy?

18:41.481 --> 18:43.848
Yeah, but it wasn't
a guy. It was a lady.

18:44.715 --> 18:47.409
- The soccer mom. I knew it.
- You did?

18:47.477 --> 18:50.470
- No, but I know it now.
- Well, that's just her cover.

18:50.538 --> 18:53.741
In reality, she's a hacker,
a sort of not-that-great hacker.

18:53.809 --> 18:55.846
But you're a sort of
not-that-great cyber cop.

18:55.914 --> 18:57.086
Yup, so it worked out.

18:57.243 --> 18:59.127
So, are we done then?

18:59.254 --> 19:01.496
No. I got to take your
router for evidence.

19:01.647 --> 19:03.037
I'll get it back to
you as soon as possible,

19:03.104 --> 19:05.579
and when I say that I mean
maybe get a new router.

19:05.737 --> 19:07.543
- Hmm.
- Anyway, thanks for your help.

19:07.620 --> 19:09.344
I mean, you didn't help, but...

19:09.848 --> 19:11.180
can you get the router, please?

19:11.402 --> 19:13.467
Whoa, what the hell is
going on here?

19:13.544 --> 19:15.793
I just got a report that a
bunch of Junior Guards trashed

19:15.870 --> 19:18.199
- the sand castle contest.
- No, no, we were helping.

19:18.276 --> 19:20.690
Tina Belcher. Of course
you were behind this.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.166
What are you even doing here?

19:22.234 --> 19:25.121
What are any of you ex-Junior
Guards even doing here?

19:25.196 --> 19:26.784
You're kicked out.
I already told you that.

19:26.851 --> 19:28.389
Yes, we destroyed
the sand castles,

19:28.466 --> 19:30.066
but we were filling in holes
and moats

19:30.134 --> 19:32.685
so people wouldn't break
their ankles.

19:32.771 --> 19:33.870
"Break their ankles"?

19:33.938 --> 19:36.405
Look, the fun run finish
line was over there,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.048
past the sand castle contest.

19:38.116 --> 19:39.970
What? That can't be.

19:40.038 --> 19:42.262
I think the fun run
usually isn't this long.

19:42.330 --> 19:44.981
Plus, the sand castle contest
is usually on a Sunday.

19:45.049 --> 19:47.344
Yeah, some idiot put
them both on the same day.

19:47.439 --> 19:49.544
Oh, my God.

19:49.776 --> 19:51.813
I may or may not have been that idiot

19:51.890 --> 19:53.462
that we're all
talking about right now.

19:53.530 --> 19:54.913
You kids saved the day

19:54.984 --> 19:57.688
and you saved my hide.
You're heroes.

19:57.829 --> 20:00.521
Sir, Tina is the one
who spotted the situation

20:00.598 --> 20:02.557
and pushed us
to do something about it.

20:02.725 --> 20:03.900
She's the real hero here.

20:03.977 --> 20:05.860
Tina, is that true, girl?

20:05.937 --> 20:08.184
I don't want to say hero,
but I like hearing it.

20:08.252 --> 20:10.996
Well, then I guess
I have no choice

20:11.092 --> 20:13.475
but to let you all graduate

20:13.543 --> 20:15.543
the Junior Lifeguards program.

20:15.662 --> 20:17.178
- All right.
- Yes.

20:17.248 --> 20:19.616
And I'm gonna request
that you never tell anyone

20:19.684 --> 20:21.808
that I was the one who
scheduled all those things

20:21.935 --> 20:23.653
- at the same time.
- Yay!

20:23.721 --> 20:25.045
So, go ahead, everybody.

20:25.113 --> 20:27.370
Get up on that pier for
your final exam.

20:27.467 --> 20:29.326
- What final exam?
- Aw, it's great.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.410
We get to jump off the
pier before we graduate.

20:31.478 --> 20:32.557
That pier?

20:35.109 --> 20:37.667
- Come on, Tina, jump!
- No, thank you.

20:37.744 --> 20:38.793
You can do it!

20:38.870 --> 20:40.989
- No, I really can't.
- Yes, you can.

20:41.057 --> 20:44.083
And, plus, also, you sort of
have to in order to graduate.

20:44.254 --> 20:46.160
- Fine, then. I'm out.
- Tina, no.

20:46.228 --> 20:47.368
Look, I'll tell you what.

20:47.436 --> 20:50.371
If you jump, you all get to
warm up in the sand together.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.000
You mean, sugar cookies?

20:52.150 --> 20:53.483
That's what I'm talking about.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.618
- Aah!
- Sugar cookies.

20:55.862 --> 20:58.029
I'm never using a towel again.
