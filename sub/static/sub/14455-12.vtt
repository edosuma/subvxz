00:12.367 --> 00:13.400
Narrator: Coming up...

00:13.400 --> 00:15.467
Why is Joe dishing it out?

00:15.467 --> 00:16.533
Thwap.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.567
What's got Q
quenching his thirst?

00:20.567 --> 00:22.833
Ohh!

00:22.833 --> 00:24.633
And which losing joker
will the be the butt

00:24.633 --> 00:28.500
of the joke
in tonight's punishment?

00:28.500 --> 00:31.333
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.400
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:34.067 --> 00:35.733
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:37.533 --> 00:40.267
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:40.267 --> 00:42.267
Joe: Larry!

00:46.067 --> 00:48.267
Heads up, today we are
working at Lids.

00:48.267 --> 00:50.100
Both: While helping customers,
we'll have to do

00:50.100 --> 00:51.567
and say what the other guys
tell us.

00:51.567 --> 00:53.467
If you refuse,
you lose.

00:56.967 --> 00:59.400
Hello. Welcome to Lids.
I'm James.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.133
I can help you with anything
if you need anything.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.067
I want you to apologize
for it being so hot in here,

01:03.067 --> 01:05.600
but in
a really sexy voice.

01:05.600 --> 01:11.233
Oh, by the way, I, um,
I apologize for it being so...

01:11.233 --> 01:12.567
hot in here.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.367
No problem.

01:15.367 --> 01:19.200
Now lean on something
and fan yourself.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.100
Ooh.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.433
So hot.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.900
You drove her
out of the store.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.800
Murray,
this bundled-up dude --

01:29.800 --> 01:31.200
get up on a ladder
and from there,

01:31.200 --> 01:32.833
ask him if his tongue
fits in his mouth.

01:35.300 --> 01:38.233
Bud. Does your tongue
fit in your mouth?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.167
Yeah. Okay.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.433
Joe: Look at him.
He's so confused.

01:46.433 --> 01:48.767
Okay, Murr,
grab the ladder.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.367
And just put it right
in front of the guy

01:50.367 --> 01:52.067
and climb it and ask him
if he needs help.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.500
Go all the way
to the top of it.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.433
Sal: Oh, if you could do it
without him noticing.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.167
Do you any help, sir?

02:01.700 --> 02:03.333
Oh, I was just wondering
if you needed any help.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.933
Well, I'm here
if you need anything.

02:05.933 --> 02:07.800
Murr, hide behind
the hat rack.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.100
Slowly just climb the ladder.

02:15.733 --> 02:17.867
You still okay
Okay.

02:17.867 --> 02:20.833
James -- if you need anything.
Lids.

02:20.833 --> 02:22.700
Murr, go in the back,
get a big ladder.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.467
You're okay?

02:37.433 --> 02:40.100
If you need anything at all --
James, Lids.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.133
Does your tongue
fit in your mouth?

02:42.133 --> 02:43.967
Does your tongue
fit in your mouth?

02:43.967 --> 02:46.167
Like with no problem,
just fits in normally, right?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.200
Yeah. All right.

02:49.467 --> 02:51.067
I could get a --

02:51.067 --> 02:53.100
I could get one for you
if it's too high.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.400
Do you want a different one?
Which one?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.400
Second green
all the way up top?

02:56.400 --> 02:57.633
Let me get the thingy.

02:59.367 --> 03:00.733
Keep missing.

03:00.733 --> 03:04.233
This one?
-Yes.

03:07.067 --> 03:09.100
You are the most
incompetent worker.

03:11.533 --> 03:13.467
It's tricky for me.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.700
Joe, jam coupons
in people's faces.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.467
Pow.

03:27.467 --> 03:30.233
Already laughing.

03:30.233 --> 03:31.267
Pow.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.367
Thwap.

03:39.167 --> 03:43.367
She literally gasped.

03:43.367 --> 03:44.567
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.167
Pow.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.100
Joe, would you take
a hat in exchange

03:50.100 --> 03:51.767
for a quick snuggle
with you or...?

03:51.767 --> 03:54.233
Hi, bud.
Quick snuggle?

03:54.233 --> 03:56.133
Quick snuggle,
if you'd like.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.933
Free hat.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.067
Do you like the hat?

03:59.067 --> 04:00.400
You want it for free?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.267
All right,
you want to snuggle?

04:03.867 --> 04:05.167
No, just you, yeah.

04:05.167 --> 04:06.600
It's got to be
the purchaser.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.067
Name's Joe, let me know.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.700
Quick snuggle.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.367
-Oh!
-Oh!

04:13.367 --> 04:15.067
Sorry? Yeah, you get
a free hat --

04:15.067 --> 04:17.600
-Oh, right up in your zone.
-Oh, snuggle.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.133
That's a hug,
that's not a snuggle.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.067
Put your arm
around me and just --

04:21.067 --> 04:23.867
-There we go.
-That'll do.

04:27.633 --> 04:29.167
Q: Hey, Sal, go behind
the counter over there

04:29.167 --> 04:31.067
and pick up
the other hat grabber.

04:34.267 --> 04:36.567
Okay, now use those like
they're your hands.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.767
There you go.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.067
If you guys
need anything,

04:41.067 --> 04:43.233
need me to get anything down
for you, I can help you.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.233
Just let me know
what you like.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.500
Grab that pamphlet.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.067
Well, let me see
where exactly --

04:50.067 --> 04:51.967
Let me see.

04:51.967 --> 04:54.800
I'm just trying to see
where you guys are coming from.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.200
Oh, I see. Did you go to --
you went over to the --

05:01.733 --> 05:02.967
What can I get you?

05:02.967 --> 05:05.300
Okay, now, Sal,
do it till it's unfunny.

05:10.433 --> 05:12.333
Oh, you guys,
where did you guys go?

05:19.900 --> 05:21.167
Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle.

05:21.167 --> 05:23.300
Where you guys going?
Let me get that hat back.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.533
You guys are all crazy.
Look at your purse.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.067
Waah!

05:28.067 --> 05:29.533
I'm robbing you.
I'm robbing you.

05:29.533 --> 05:32.567
Oh,
I got your backpack.

05:32.567 --> 05:36.067
It's getting unfunny.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.133
Ah, we might've sold out.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.133
Sal, be so disappointed
that you don't have it.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.367
I know that you
wanted the hat.

05:47.367 --> 05:49.733
I know you wanted it
with a passion and everything.

05:49.733 --> 05:51.067
It's my goal
to get it to you,

05:51.067 --> 05:52.467
and we didn't have it,

05:52.467 --> 05:55.833
so I'm really sorry
that we didn't have the hat.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.067
Sal, if you can cry...

05:58.067 --> 05:59.900
But it's not
the hat you wanted.

06:03.067 --> 06:04.367
Joe: Sal's trying
to make himself cry.

06:04.367 --> 06:06.533
Look, look, look.
Just think about your life.

06:09.733 --> 06:11.233
I'm starting crying
thinking of Sal's life.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.967
Well, that's the hat
that you wanted,

06:13.967 --> 06:15.667
and we couldn't get it for you.
And I just feel bad about it

06:15.667 --> 06:17.267
because -- I know.

06:17.267 --> 06:19.300
Joe: They're consoling him.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.567
Just know that I tried,
yeah.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.067
Look how many hats we have,

06:25.067 --> 06:26.700
and then the one hat
that you want,

06:26.700 --> 06:27.833
I don't have it.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.667
I'm sorry.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.067
Murr: He can't hold it together.
Look at him.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.700
Oh, my God,
you're gonna take it.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.867
Go ring him up,
go ring him up.

06:42.867 --> 06:45.200
-I'll get it.
-Let me just say --

06:45.200 --> 06:47.133
I loved you in "Goonies."

06:47.133 --> 06:49.133
-Oh!

06:51.767 --> 06:54.233
-$24.99.

06:58.867 --> 07:00.633
He put his Twitter handle
right on the hat.

07:00.633 --> 07:02.067
I'm expanding
the global brand.

07:02.067 --> 07:04.800
-Very good. @BQQuinn.
-That's right.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.733
But you forgot
I'm in charge of the blurs.

07:06.733 --> 07:10.300
Yeah, so?

07:10.300 --> 07:11.933
It's blurred now.
Nothing you can do about it.

07:11.933 --> 07:13.067
The global brand.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.433
Okay, put my Twitter handle
on it, too,

07:14.433 --> 07:15.967
then,
you get all unblurred.

07:15.967 --> 07:17.267
So I do that,
the blur's gone.

07:17.267 --> 07:18.867
-Yeah.
-Wait.

07:18.867 --> 07:21.067
What kind of deal
are you striking here?

07:23.500 --> 07:25.367
-That's great -- unblurred.

07:25.367 --> 07:26.600
-Good, all right.
-That's great.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.800
Thank you. Thanks, man.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.767
Do that thing where my name
shoots in underneath

07:29.767 --> 07:31.733
and says "Sal" with my Twitter
handle on it right now.

07:31.733 --> 07:33.633
Right now.
-Let's change that to mine.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.833
-No.
-Okay, hold on.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.067
And if we're
doing that thing,

07:37.067 --> 07:39.900
cut to my OkCupid profile
right now.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.067
Now my OkCupid is public.

07:42.067 --> 07:44.267
-No, I just put up bars.

07:44.267 --> 07:45.800
Just trying
to get my OkCupid profile.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.767
You know what?
I'm blurring his face.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.400
Wait, no!

07:49.400 --> 07:51.067
You're getting
power hungry, Joe.

07:51.067 --> 07:52.367
What do I look like?

07:52.367 --> 07:54.067
All you see is my hands.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.467
Yeah, now you're
James Blurry.

07:57.467 --> 07:59.400
-We can't understand you.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.133
Every time you talk,
I'm beeping it.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.967
It took us this long
to realize

08:05.967 --> 08:08.333
he could be
fully censored.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.467
You're effectively removed.
Oh, my God.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.800
I wish I had the blur function
in my own eyeballs.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.233
Looking for
something specific?

08:17.233 --> 08:19.400
Just checking it out.
Yeah.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.067
I just polished off
a swordfish Parm sandwich.

08:22.067 --> 08:25.133
I apologize if I'm
a little sluggish today.

08:25.133 --> 08:29.333
I just -- I just polished off
a swordfish Parm sandwich.

08:33.367 --> 08:35.533
Just start naming
all the Parms that you've tried.

08:35.533 --> 08:38.367
Lamb Parm's pretty good,
I had that a few times.

08:38.367 --> 08:40.700
Goat Parm.
Quail Parm.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.067
Armadillo Parm.

08:42.067 --> 08:44.567
Rhino Parm, tuna Parm.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.767
Turtle Parm. Gorilla Parm.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.767
Oh, ostrich Parm.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.333
Orangutan Parm.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.533
Zebra Parm.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.533
Donkey Parm.

08:54.533 --> 08:57.733
Donkey Parm.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.533
Donkey Parm Junior.

09:02.067 --> 09:05.400
-He's inching to the door.
-If you just crisp --

09:05.400 --> 09:10.333
He's like, "Come on."

09:10.333 --> 09:11.767
Let me tell you --
that would be delightful.

09:11.767 --> 09:14.833
My mom used to make
this wolf Parm

09:14.833 --> 09:16.433
whenever we went on vacation.

09:16.433 --> 09:18.067
-Yeah, he's gone.
-He's gone, Q.

09:20.567 --> 09:22.933
Narrator: The only place
Sal can hang his hat

09:22.933 --> 09:25.800
is on the loser board.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.367
We took a road trip today,

09:27.367 --> 09:28.933
and we're working at
the Florida Mall

09:28.933 --> 09:30.700
at our friend
Joey Fatone's new place

09:30.700 --> 09:33.100
Fat One's Hot Dogs
and Italian Ice.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.767
While helping customers out,
we've got to do

09:34.767 --> 09:36.233
and say
what the other guys tell us.

09:36.233 --> 09:38.633
If you refuse to do
or say anything, you lose.

09:38.633 --> 09:41.100
You will never work
in hot dogs again!

09:43.267 --> 09:45.400
Joe: All right,
here we are at Fat One's.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.433
Uh, my Fatone sense
is tingling.

09:48.433 --> 09:49.933
Here comes --
There he is.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.933
I'm always watching.
I'm always watching.

09:51.933 --> 09:53.200
How are you?

09:53.200 --> 09:54.633
Welcome to Fat One's.
How are you?

09:56.467 --> 09:58.267
Slurp down a wien,
perhaps?

09:58.267 --> 10:01.800
Slurp down a wien,
though, perhaps?

10:03.267 --> 10:05.833
Slurp down a wien,
perhaps?

10:07.233 --> 10:10.533
-Yes.
-Yeah, yeah.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.700
-Okay.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.133
Welcome to Fat One's.

10:15.933 --> 10:17.133
Which gender?

10:17.133 --> 10:19.633
And what, uh, what gender
would you like that to be?

10:20.833 --> 10:22.300
Male or female.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.600
One male lemonade.
There you go.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.100
-Thank you.
-You got it.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.500
When do we start
getting hot dogs?

10:32.500 --> 10:35.900
-That's $5.
damn it.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.967
Can I get a hot dog?

10:37.967 --> 10:39.300
Just get me one.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.667
Yeah, thanks.

10:40.667 --> 10:43.600
Joe: Here comes Fatone,
he's just getting Q a hot dog.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.100
You guys
enjoying your food?

10:46.100 --> 10:48.033
-Yeah.
-Awesome. Love it.

10:48.033 --> 10:50.767
Hey, Murray, tell Fatone
to bring me my hot dog back.

10:50.767 --> 10:53.533
Mr. Quinn ordered a hot dog.
Can you please get it for him?

10:53.533 --> 10:57.067
Yes, I'll get it for him.
I'm waiting for it to be cooked.

10:57.067 --> 10:58.700
Murr,
get aggressive with him.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.567
Can I speak to you
for a second?

11:02.200 --> 11:03.733
Get it together, man.

11:03.733 --> 11:05.933
Dude --
You will be bounced out
of this mall so fast.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.633
When Mr. Quinn
wants a hot dog,

11:07.633 --> 11:11.567
you get him a hot dog.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.667
Fine, just give me
the hot dog then.

11:15.733 --> 11:17.333
Sal,
follow up with him.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.933
The problem is you have to
learn how to talk to people.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.400
Hi, guys, welcome
to Fat One's.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.667
Sal, I didn't know
you people ate hot dogs.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.700
Murray, not you because
I know you'll say it.

11:34.700 --> 11:35.967
Sal.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.067
I didn't know
you people ate hot dogs.

11:38.067 --> 11:40.200
Say it.
Say it.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.867
Oh, okay, I didn't know
you people ate hot dogs.

11:43.867 --> 11:48.067
-Oh!

11:48.067 --> 11:49.900
Oh, sir, sir,

11:49.900 --> 11:51.467
we have a hot dog
named after you.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.800
Sir, we actually have
a hot dog named after you.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.133
It's called the "Turtle
Without a Shell."

11:55.133 --> 11:56.400
Goodbye.
-No, oh, oh.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.500
No, oh, oh.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.433
Lead it.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.433
The New Yorker.
You seem like a New Yorker.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.367
Yeah, there you go, guys.
There you go.

12:10.767 --> 12:12.500
Hi, how are you?
Free hot dog? Great.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.733
Which one
would you like, hon?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.400
-The Don Hollywood.
-The Don Hollywood, great.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.133
It is Fat One's policy
that she smells

12:17.133 --> 12:18.633
all the buns
for freshness

12:18.633 --> 12:20.667
and picks the one she wants.
-It's a great policy.

12:20.667 --> 12:21.967
Okay, so they're three
different kinds?

12:21.967 --> 12:23.500
These are three
different buns, yeah.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.533
You smell the buns
for freshness,

12:24.533 --> 12:27.133
you pick the one you like.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.567
Just make sure
you pick which one.

12:28.567 --> 12:29.967
They smell differently?

12:29.967 --> 12:33.500
We trust you, yeah,
'cause we don't want to --

12:33.500 --> 12:34.700
So you like --
-Middle one's fine.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.433
Put the other two back.
She'll take the middle one.

12:36.433 --> 12:38.500
Q: We'll be having the middle
bun for this one.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.900
Okay, so --
A large drink.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.200
Just a little bit of ice,
not a lot.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.500
Little bit of ice.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.067
Fill that whole
thing up with ice.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.933
Murr: Yeah.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.067
-Thank you.
-There you go.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.300
Uh...

12:53.300 --> 12:56.400
I wanted, like,
less than half of that.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.133
Oh, okay, you just pick out
the ones you don't want,

12:58.133 --> 13:00.967
I'll just
put them back.

13:00.967 --> 13:03.500
Are you serious?

13:03.500 --> 13:05.067
Yeah.
I got a line forming, hon.

13:05.067 --> 13:06.267
If you could just pick out
the ones you don't want

13:06.267 --> 13:08.667
and just put them in --

13:08.667 --> 13:10.500
Now are these the ones
you wanted or didn't want?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.800
Did not.
These are did not,
so these you want.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.067
These are the ones we want,
so put these back.

13:14.067 --> 13:15.467
We'll use these later.

13:15.467 --> 13:18.300
So one person's trash
is another person's fresh.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.467
What do you need,
hot dog?

13:23.467 --> 13:25.267
-I'll do the New Yorker.
-New Yorker, yep.

13:25.267 --> 13:28.067
Q, does he know he could
have that in liquid form?

13:28.067 --> 13:29.300
Murr: Oh.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.067
Why don't you push
the hot dog shake on him

13:31.067 --> 13:32.700
that you're trying
to get on the menu?

13:32.700 --> 13:34.433
Hot dog shake.

13:34.433 --> 13:36.400
Did you know, sir, um,

13:36.400 --> 13:40.067
that you can have that
complete meal in a liquid form?

13:40.067 --> 13:41.800
Liquid form?

13:41.800 --> 13:43.467
I'll just show you,
I'll just show you.

13:43.467 --> 13:45.567
Sal: He puts in two hot dogs
with the bun.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.333
-Oh.
-Oh, no, yeah.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.267
It's surprisingly, yeah.

13:51.267 --> 13:53.067
Oh!

13:53.067 --> 13:55.333
Little chili to make it
more solidified, little chili.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.900
You're the boss.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.233
-Great.
-All right, now.

14:01.233 --> 14:03.600
This is not
gonna be good.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.667
Look at
that disgusting thing.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.900
Look at the crowd forming.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.700
It's a new smoothie we do
here at Fat One's.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.133
It's a new
hot dog smoothie.

14:12.533 --> 14:14.167
Yeah,
it's like a juice thing.

14:14.167 --> 14:16.600
Yeah, you do it
with a hot dog now.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.967
Try this.
Try this.

14:18.967 --> 14:23.067
-Oh, my God, Q.
-Look at that.

14:23.067 --> 14:25.067
Oh, my God.

14:25.067 --> 14:27.067
Try that, sir.
You want to try that?

14:27.067 --> 14:28.333
Smoothie hot dog,
just take a sip.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.367
-Try that.
-Q, a good chef always tastes

14:30.367 --> 14:31.467
what he makes
before he serves it.

14:31.467 --> 14:32.833
Pour one for yourself,
too, bud.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.100
You've been working hard.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.333
-All right.
-A toast.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.733
-Cheers, guys, cheers.
-Cheers.

14:37.733 --> 14:41.467
Cheers, everybody.
-Cheers.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.967
Oh, my God.

14:46.967 --> 14:49.867
He said it was delicious.

14:49.867 --> 14:52.533
She's drinking it, too.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.467
Q, how is it?

14:58.467 --> 15:00.333
It's not bad.

15:02.667 --> 15:06.900
Narrator: Hot dog,
Sal is tonight's big loser.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.900
So Sal's our loser,
and he does stand-up comedy,

15:10.900 --> 15:12.900
but he never invites us
to his show.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.067
-No.
-So today, Sal,

15:14.067 --> 15:15.867
we're gonna make you
do it for us instead.

15:15.867 --> 15:18.833
Except we want you
to absolutely bomb.

15:18.833 --> 15:20.800
-Oh, my God.
-We brought you to

15:20.800 --> 15:23.667
the Advanced Learning
Institute Conference, buddy.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.700
Serious business people
from all over

15:25.700 --> 15:28.100
the country converge here
for this conference.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.133
2:00 P.M. at a business
conference, yeah,

15:30.133 --> 15:31.333
they're ready for me
right now.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.267
Bring out the guy
in a fish tie.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.500
Sal, you have to
absolutely bomb.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.633
Oh, God.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.167
Look.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.933
I think they call
that flop sweat, buddy.

15:41.933 --> 15:43.933
You haven't even
flopped yet.

15:43.933 --> 15:48.267
We have done a lot of business
talk these last few days.

15:48.267 --> 15:51.300
This is the end of a
three-day technology conference.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.567
Probably the worst place

15:52.567 --> 15:54.267
you can go up there
and try and do stand-up.

15:54.267 --> 15:55.467
People
just want to go home.

15:55.467 --> 15:56.733
This is
every comic's nightmare.

15:56.733 --> 15:58.067
This is every person's
nightmare.

15:58.067 --> 16:00.167
Now, you all know we tour
as the Impractical Jokers.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.267
Sal also does stand-up
on his own.

16:02.267 --> 16:04.433
He loves it.
It's his number-one passion.

16:04.433 --> 16:06.233
Passion.
He's actually
living that dream now,

16:06.233 --> 16:08.400
and now living
that nightmare.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.533
Please welcome Sal Vulcano.

16:13.533 --> 16:16.367
Murr: Here we go.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.533
Do not be funny.

16:17.533 --> 16:20.333
I know it's hard,
but you can't be funny.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.967
Hey.

16:21.967 --> 16:23.700
Is this on?
-We hear you.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.200
Oh, you hear me? Okay.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.767
Uh, how's everybody doing?
-Good.

16:27.767 --> 16:29.900
Okay, Sal, bomb.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.700
Uh, I heard you guys
were here for a conference?

16:32.700 --> 16:34.167
You guys here
for business?

16:34.167 --> 16:36.933
-Yes.

16:36.933 --> 16:39.067
Funny business?

16:42.733 --> 16:44.700
That was actually
too funny, Sal.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.467
I would like you
to rein that in.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.567
I --

16:48.567 --> 16:50.067
The funny thing
about a conference call...

16:50.067 --> 16:52.100
The funny thing about
a conference call...

16:52.100 --> 16:53.633
...is that you can't see
the people on the other line.

16:53.633 --> 16:57.067
...is that you can't see
the people on the other line.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.267
'Cause
when you have meetings,

16:58.267 --> 17:01.967
it's probably much more
effective communicating.

17:01.967 --> 17:03.333
Ba-dum-tss.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.333
Riff about marriage
a little bit.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.800
Oh, man, I'm divorced.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.800
Uh, women be shopping.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.667
The laughter's
getting awkward now.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.267
Mm, boy.
All right.

17:20.267 --> 17:21.700
Now talk about
your family.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.133
Uh, I have three siblings.

17:24.133 --> 17:26.533
Tough growing up
with three sisters.

17:26.533 --> 17:29.800
Tough getting some
bathroom time.

17:29.800 --> 17:34.900
All right.
-Oh, they're starting to turn.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.400
Never get to punch lines.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.667
So, you know,
a lot of people think that,

17:40.667 --> 17:42.300
you know, women are bad drivers.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.600
I'm here to tell you
they're not.

17:49.267 --> 17:50.667
All right, so --

17:50.667 --> 17:51.967
Murr:
Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger

17:51.967 --> 17:53.733
finding an onion ring
in his fries.

17:53.733 --> 17:56.067
Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger

17:56.067 --> 17:59.733
finding an onion ring
in his fries.

17:59.733 --> 18:02.267
What is this?

18:02.267 --> 18:04.067
I did not want an onion ring.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.967
I wanted fries.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.333
Murr:
Look at the faces in the room.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.067
Dude.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.200
Joe: Okay, Sal, you got
to keep bombing.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.667
One last impression for you.
-One last impression.

18:24.433 --> 18:25.700
This is -- this is --

18:25.700 --> 18:28.767
Q: They're openly
mocking you.

18:28.767 --> 18:32.567
Here's Republican Ohio
State Senator Rob Portman.

18:32.567 --> 18:35.133
Here's one -- here's a new one
I'm working on.

18:35.133 --> 18:37.467
Republican Ohio Senator
Robert Portman.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.567
-Picking up his dry cleaning.
-Picking up his dry cleaning.

18:42.200 --> 18:46.067
What? I'm sorry,
I don't have the ticket.

18:46.067 --> 18:49.567
I'm Robert Portman.
I'm the senator from Ohio.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.700
Can I please have my stuff?

18:52.700 --> 18:56.267
I have some ID on me.

18:56.267 --> 18:57.933
Good enough?
Thank you.

18:57.933 --> 18:59.800
Ooh.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.067
Oh, my God,
this is awful.

19:02.067 --> 19:08.400
You know, uh, abortion is,

19:08.400 --> 19:10.733
uh, not a --

19:10.733 --> 19:11.767
Let's skip that one.

19:14.467 --> 19:16.433
Look at the faces
in the room.

19:16.433 --> 19:18.333
-Oh.
-Dude.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.567
So...

19:19.567 --> 19:21.067
Sal, is it getting hot in there?
Take your jacket off.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.333
Yeah, take your jacket off,
bud.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.233
We put Sal's outfit
together today.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.667
There's his suspenders,
there's his suspenders.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.600
Where are my single
booze bags at?

19:30.600 --> 19:33.167
Where are my single
booze bags at?

19:33.167 --> 19:35.233
Nobody?
Just me.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.800
All right, I just got
about 22 minutes left,

19:39.800 --> 19:43.767
just trying to fill
the time here.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.367
All right.

19:45.367 --> 19:49.333
-Wow.
-Oh, my skin is crawling.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.200
This went great.
All right, thank you.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.267
Asians, right?

19:52.267 --> 19:54.867
Asians, am I right?

19:54.867 --> 19:56.833
I love Asians.
I have an Asian wife.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.567
I lied -- I do have a wife.

19:58.567 --> 20:00.500
Got all of you.
I got all of you on that.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.367
I just dropped a bomb on you.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.600
Well, literally
and figuratively, all right.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.800
Just get out of there.
You've had enough.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.367
Okay, bye.

20:10.233 --> 20:13.100
Thanks a lot, guys.
Appreciate it.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.167
Everything's gonna be okay.

20:15.167 --> 20:18.200
That was bad.

20:21.067 --> 20:22.633
Oh, my God.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.700
Sal just bombed in one

20:27.700 --> 20:29.600
of the cringiest punishments
we've ever done,

20:29.600 --> 20:30.867
and now you get
a behind-the-scenes

20:30.867 --> 20:32.067
look at
how it happened.

20:32.067 --> 20:33.600
He's soaking wet.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.067
And I'm gonna give you bonus
footage from tonight's episode.

20:36.067 --> 20:38.400
So you should
cool down a little.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.400
We'd like to begin,
but we're missing somebody.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.767
-We're missing Sal.

20:42.767 --> 20:45.433
-Um, Murr is brushing his tooth.

20:45.433 --> 20:47.133
Well, I mean, ever since
it fell out on TV,

20:47.133 --> 20:48.433
he keeps it
really clean.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.967
-Oh.

20:52.967 --> 20:54.633
Ah, your tooth.
Is that your tooth?

20:54.633 --> 20:56.033
Is that your tooth?
Holy !

20:56.033 --> 20:58.033
Oh, my God.
His tooth just fell out.

20:58.033 --> 21:01.700
Joe: Murray's tooth
just fell out.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.267
Every single shoot,

21:03.267 --> 21:04.800
you brush your teeth
before you begin.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.167
Yes.

21:06.167 --> 21:09.333
I feel like...

21:09.333 --> 21:11.933
Yes. This sounds weird.
There's a couple reasons.

21:11.933 --> 21:14.233
One is I have
very bad teeth.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.067
Second,
I eat after every meal,

21:16.067 --> 21:17.733
and I eat all day
long on set,

21:17.733 --> 21:19.133
so I'm constantly
brushing my teeth.

21:19.133 --> 21:22.400
Third, this is gonna
sound crazy --

21:22.400 --> 21:25.967
I feel like I'm funnier
when I have fresh breath.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.067
Is that weird?

21:27.067 --> 21:29.233
David:
Three, two, one.

21:29.233 --> 21:32.067
So Sal's our loser,
and he does stand-up comedy,

21:32.067 --> 21:33.833
but he never invites us
to his show.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.233
-Oh, my God.
-You can't be funny.

21:35.233 --> 21:36.467
Joe:
The more funny you are,

21:36.467 --> 21:38.167
the longer we're gonna
keep you out there.

21:38.167 --> 21:39.433
You guys hear that?
What?

21:39.433 --> 21:42.467
Crickets?

21:44.100 --> 21:46.633
Sal Vulcano's
stand-up comedy.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.800
You know what it is,
is it's also like a funny way

21:51.800 --> 21:53.867
to get people to know
that Sal's doing stand-up,

21:53.867 --> 21:55.400
so really --

21:55.400 --> 21:56.667
-You're kind of promoting --
-It's like a commercial for him.

21:56.667 --> 21:59.300
It's kind of like
a get the word out there.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.133
-It's a terrible commercial.
-Yeah, but people are gonna know

22:01.133 --> 22:03.100
that he's doing
bad stand-up on purpose.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.067
But they're gonna be like,
"I didn't know he did stand-up,"

22:05.067 --> 22:07.700
and then he can go and people
will look it up online.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.767
It's like when
a local commercial is so bad

22:09.767 --> 22:11.933
that everyone's like,
"I have to go there."
Exactly.

22:11.933 --> 22:14.067
Joe: I worked at a Chinese
restaurant and I got in trouble.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.233
I used to work
at a Chinese restaurant.

22:16.233 --> 22:18.100
That was interesting,
I got in trouble one time.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.100
I had to report
to Hunan Resources.

22:21.100 --> 22:24.500
I had to report
to Hunan Resources.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
-Ohhh.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.833
What's black and white
and black and white

22:28.833 --> 22:30.400
and black and white
and red?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.067
What's black and white
and black and white

22:32.067 --> 22:33.367
and black and white
and red?

22:33.367 --> 22:34.833
A nun falling
down the stairs.

22:34.833 --> 22:38.300
-Oh.
-Well, this is an oldie.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.833
Yeah.

22:39.833 --> 22:42.267
A nun falling
down the stairs.

22:44.233 --> 22:46.200
Explain the joke.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.733
'Cause she has --
her outfit's black and white,

22:48.733 --> 22:51.300
then as she turns,
it keeps on going.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.200
Then at the end, in this joke,

22:53.200 --> 22:55.433
she punctures herself
and bleeds.

22:57.633 --> 22:59.433
What did you think
about that performance?

22:59.433 --> 23:01.333
I thought
he was terrible.

23:01.333 --> 23:03.667
And I was
concerned for him.

23:03.667 --> 23:06.633
I found out my aunt has cancer.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.067
Uh, it's okay, though.

23:08.067 --> 23:10.467
She died in a car accident
before it could take her.

23:10.467 --> 23:12.233
-Look at their faces.

23:12.233 --> 23:14.100
Look at their faces.

23:22.267 --> 23:24.800
-What a dope.
-You got to be kidding me.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.433
Hey, yo,
welcome to Lids.

23:26.433 --> 23:27.667
Oh, my God.

23:27.667 --> 23:31.667
This is the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

23:31.667 --> 23:32.833
I can't.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.767
That's your character study
of a hip person?

23:34.767 --> 23:37.600
Wait, what's happening?
What's happening?

23:39.067 --> 23:42.133
Nobody told
you to do this.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.633
-Okay.
-Nice work, Joey.

23:43.633 --> 23:46.600
Go ask those people
if they need help.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.733
You guys need help?
I'm James.

23:48.733 --> 23:50.100
I went to Georgetown.
