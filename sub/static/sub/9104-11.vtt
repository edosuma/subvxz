&lrm;Epic, Chloe, just epic!

03:26.720 --> 03:29.120
&lrm;What do we do without our lead actress?

03:29.280 --> 03:31.480
&lrm;Who needs her? She was totally lame.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.680
&lrm;[Ivan] You're lame!

03:32.840 --> 03:35.040
&lrm;Mylene's crying her eyes out
&lrm;thanks to you.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.800
&lrm;[Chloe] Me, lame?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.840
&lrm;Hey, everyone chill out.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.080
&lrm;You're right.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.520
&lrm;[whispering] Chloe is lame.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.160
&lrm;But fighting won't bring Mylene back.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.800
&lrm;I'm the producer and I'll do all I can

03:45.960 --> 03:47.680
&lrm;to finish filming tonight.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.280
&lrm;The deadline
&lrm;for the Short Film Festival is

03:50.440 --> 03:53.200
&lrm;tomorrow in precisely 26 hours,
&lrm;15 minutes and...

03:53.360 --> 03:54.680
&lrm;13 seconds from now.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.320
&lrm;Thank you, Max.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.880
&lrm;We still have editing, post-sound,...

03:59.040 --> 04:00.960
&lrm;Who's gonna take Mylene's part?

04:01.120 --> 04:02.280
&lrm;Me, of course.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.120
&lrm;You haven't read the script.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.800
&lrm;Of course I have...
&lrm;The first scene anyway.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.520
&lrm;It ends with a kiss
&lrm;between Agent Smith and Officer Jones.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.480
&lrm;[she shrieks]

04:16.880 --> 04:18.279
&lrm;You wrote that?

04:18.440 --> 04:19.920
&lrm;Hold up.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.519
&lrm;I didn't write that.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.480
&lrm;I wrote it. It was just a little tweak

04:24.640 --> 04:26.240
&lrm;to move the story forward.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.720
&lrm;What? You edited my script
&lrm;without even telling me?

04:29.880 --> 04:31.440
&lrm;That's low!

04:31.600 --> 04:33.960
&lrm;[she growls] You mean our script.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.440
&lrm;[he sighs]

&lrm;-Juice?
&lrm;-Thanks, Rose.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.840
&lrm;Who cares who wrote what?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.520
&lrm;We've got to film this thing right?

04:42.680 --> 04:43.760
&lrm;She's right.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.440
&lrm;We can only use the school until 6pm sharp

04:46.600 --> 04:51.480
&lrm;which leaves us 9 hours, 12 minutes
&lrm;and 12 seconds, 11, 10, 9, 8...

04:51.640 --> 04:53.320
&lrm;[Max counts down]

04:53.880 --> 04:57.440
&lrm;Adrien and Chloe kissing
&lrm;cannot happen... No way!

04:57.600 --> 05:01.120
&lrm;It makes no sense story-wise anyway.
&lrm;The main character's...

05:01.280 --> 05:02.320
&lrm;Hold on.

05:04.120 --> 05:07.800
&lrm;We can't just let Mylene leave.
&lrm;It's wrong.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.840
&lrm;We all chose her to play
&lrm;the lead female role

05:11.000 --> 05:13.120
&lrm;and we're all in this movie together.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.680
&lrm;She needs our support.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.000
&lrm;I'm gonna find her and bring her back.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.280
&lrm;Always trying to save the day,
&lrm;aren't you, Marinette?

05:20.440 --> 05:24.120

05:24.280 --> 05:25.880
&lrm;[Marinette growls]

05:28.440 --> 05:32.480

&lrm;[evil voice] Horrificator, I am Hawk Moth.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.000
&lrm;Up until now, you have felt fear.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.600
&lrm;From now on, you will cause fear.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.680
&lrm;And after you've shown them
&lrm;how they make you feel,

05:48.840 --> 05:51.000
&lrm;you'll do something for me in return.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.880
&lrm;[evil voice] Yes, Hawk Moth.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.560

06:21.640 --> 06:23.040
&lrm;Did you find Mylene?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.280
&lrm;No.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.280
&lrm;You'd better come ASAP.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.000
&lrm;There's some serious lip-puckering
&lrm;about to get going on.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.400
&lrm;Time for you to use
&lrm;your scare tactics, Horrificator...

06:34.560 --> 06:36.080
&lrm;and thrive!

<i>&lrm;Cut!</i>

06:49.840 --> 06:51.600
&lrm;Marinette, what gives?

06:51.760 --> 06:55.400
&lrm;We're in the middle of a shoot
&lrm;and I'm the director, FYI.

06:55.560 --> 06:58.120
&lrm;I say "cut," no-one else, comprende?

06:58.280 --> 07:01.520
&lrm;And I'm the producer.
&lrm;Mylene's supposed to be the star.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.160
&lrm;We're out of time.

07:03.320 --> 07:06.480
&lrm;And for what I can see, Mylene is MIA.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.560
&lrm;From the top.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.200
&lrm;Here we go again.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.200
&lrm;Agent Smith doesn't need
&lrm;a man in her life.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.320
&lrm;Sniffles just got munched on.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.600
&lrm;Do you wanna finish this film or not?

07:17.760 --> 07:20.120
&lrm;Let's make Agent Smith a nurse instead.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.720
&lrm;That'll fix everything.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.720
&lrm;Sorry, but how exactly?

07:23.880 --> 07:26.680
&lrm;I don't know
&lrm;but I'll look amazing in a uniform.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.320
&lrm;We're not rewriting

07:28.480 --> 07:29.560
&lrm;the script again!

07:29.720 --> 07:31.760
&lrm;"Alya" is not going on those credits!

07:31.920 --> 07:33.160
&lrm;[Chloe] Nobody cares!

07:33.320 --> 07:34.440
&lrm;[Ayla] What?

07:34.600 --> 07:36.200
&lrm;Everyone calm down.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.960
&lrm;This movie's a team effort.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.440
&lrm;Your nurse idea is perfect, Chloe.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.440
&lrm;Of course it is because it's mine.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.240
&lrm;But Chloe, you don't have a uniform.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.960
&lrm;Which is why
&lrm;that idea was never believable.

07:53.120 --> 07:57.320
&lrm;You should go to the nurse's office
&lrm;and try on some uniforms.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.600
&lrm;[fingers click] Kim, Max, come!

07:59.760 --> 08:02.680
&lrm;You've been promoted
&lrm;to wardrobe and bodyguard.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.000
&lrm;Nice going, Miss Producer,
&lrm;now we have no lead again.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.560
&lrm;Yeah, but now we've got rid of Chloe.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.560
&lrm;And now what?

08:15.720 --> 08:18.360
&lrm;We go find Mylene. She's here somewhere.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.720
&lrm;I told you, tick-toc, there's no time.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.520
&lrm;-We need a lead, now!
&lrm;-Marinette can do it.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.280
&lrm;What? No! I can't act. I'm the producer.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.160
&lrm;But you wanna kiss Adrien, don't you?

08:30.320 --> 08:31.760
&lrm;[she sighs]

08:31.920 --> 08:34.320
&lrm;Yes, but not like this.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.960
&lrm;A nurse's uniform, how brilliant am I?

08:38.120 --> 08:41.000
&lrm;Even that dimwit,
&lrm;Marinette, liked the idea.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.320
&lrm;[swishing]

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
&lrm;I'm only doing this as a favour.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.200
&lrm;When Mylene returns
&lrm;she'll have her role back.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.200
&lrm;Of course she will, chill out.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.400
&lrm;And just think, after tonight,

08:53.560 --> 08:55.800
&lrm;you'll finally have kissed Adrien.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
&lrm;[Marinette squeals]

09:00.560 --> 09:02.800
&lrm;Hey, wait a minute.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.160
&lrm;Marinette never likes my ideas,

09:05.320 --> 09:07.120
&lrm;I think you've all been duped.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.240
&lrm;You guys take care of the uniform
&lrm;just in case.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.800
&lrm;-Did you hear something?
&lrm;-No, what?

09:19.240 --> 09:21.880
&lrm;Totally unbelievable.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.280
&lrm;What's that?

09:23.440 --> 09:25.120
&lrm;I said...

09:25.280 --> 09:27.600
&lrm;It's got to be believable.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.760
&lrm;Don't worry. You'll do fine.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.480
&lrm;Ready to roll? Camera...

&lrm;What did I say about people saying "cut"?

09:47.800 --> 09:49.400
&lrm;Well played, Marinette.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.680
&lrm;All that speech on working together,

09:51.840 --> 09:53.600
&lrm;Then you stab me in the back!

09:53.760 --> 09:57.320
&lrm;Your stupid movie won't get
&lrm;into the festival if I'm not in it

09:57.480 --> 09:59.640

&lrm;is one of the judges!

10:03.840 --> 10:06.840
&lrm;If this is one of your silly ploys
&lrm;to get rid of me

10:07.000 --> 10:08.960
&lrm;you can forget it, besides...

10:09.120 --> 10:11.480
&lrm;[horrific screaming]

10:11.880 --> 10:15.080
&lrm;I definitely heard that.
&lrm;We'd better scope this out.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.240
&lrm;A snack for the road?

10:22.680 --> 10:26.240
<i>&lrm;Hey! Anybody here? Kim? Max?</i>

10:26.400 --> 10:27.320
&lrm;Where are you?

10:28.640 --> 10:31.960
&lrm;I saw the same pink goo in the bathroom.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.280
&lrm;That's Kim's.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.200
<i>&lrm;They've vanished.</i>

10:36.360 --> 10:38.200
<i>&lrm;Or they're playing a sick joke.</i>

10:38.680 --> 10:41.480
&lrm;We should tell Principle Damocles
&lrm;what's going on.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.880
&lrm;Nino, come on, stop filming.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.800
&lrm;No way. This is just getting good.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.000
&lrm;Looks like it's time
&lrm;to bring in the alter ego.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.240
&lrm;Yo, Adrien, where you going?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.360
&lrm;I left Officer Jones's jacket.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.920
&lrm;She'll probably wear it in all the scenes.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.880
&lrm;[snarling]

11:03.360 --> 11:06.760
&lrm;[splodging]

11:07.360 --> 11:08.920
&lrm;Time to transform, Plagg.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.560
&lrm;What are you doing?

11:11.160 --> 11:12.200
&lrm;[he gasps]

11:12.360 --> 11:14.440
&lrm;They'll think I've disappeared too.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.000
&lrm;[Plagg] And you say I stink of camembert.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.320
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

11:33.520 --> 11:35.880
&lrm;[knocking] Mr Damocles? Sir?

11:36.280 --> 11:37.320
&lrm;[gasping]

11:37.480 --> 11:40.200
&lrm;[Rose] Even Principle Damocles is missing.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.760
&lrm;Time to transform.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.800
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

12:07.080 --> 12:09.520
<i>&lrm;Anyone seen Agent Smith?</i>

12:09.960 --> 12:11.920
&lrm;I mean, Marinette.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.000
&lrm;[gasping]

12:18.160 --> 12:20.240
&lrm;Oh on. This is Marinette's phone.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.280
&lrm;[grunting]

12:23.120 --> 12:25.320
&lrm;Quick, check the windows.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.160
&lrm;Crazy.

12:27.320 --> 12:31.160
&lrm;We're trapped. I'm calling daddy.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.720
&lrm;Dudes, phones never work in horror movies.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.520
&lrm;-No bars.
&lrm;-No coverage.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.360
&lrm;Told you so. Boo-ya!

12:39.680 --> 12:40.680
&lrm;[gasping]

12:40.840 --> 12:41.920
&lrm;Is everything OK?

12:42.080 --> 12:45.120
&lrm;Ladybug in my movie, this is legit.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.920
&lrm;And on my Ladyblog.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.480
&lrm;We've got to evacuate the building, OK?

12:49.640 --> 12:50.760
&lrm;No...

12:50.880 --> 12:52.800
&lrm;That's easier said than done.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.520
&lrm;Double legit!

12:54.680 --> 12:57.960
&lrm;I tried to cut through it
&lrm;but it's totally indestructible.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.080
&lrm;So we're trapped inside for now.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.000
&lrm;Stay put and try to relax.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.520
&lrm;Let's take a stroll.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.360
&lrm;We know Hawk Moth's taken
&lrm;another victim in this school.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.960
&lrm;There's one way to get rid of
&lrm;this goo and free everyone...

13:12.120 --> 13:13.280
&lrm;capture that Akuma.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.120
&lrm;Exactly,
&lrm;I love it when you read my mind.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.840
&lrm;We'd better find this thing first
&lrm;and its prisoners.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.560
&lrm;Wow, you did it again.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.840
&lrm;Don't mind me.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.360
&lrm;Finding missing peeps,
&lrm;solving a mystery,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.240
&lrm;with Cat Noir and Ladybug!

13:29.400 --> 13:31.520
&lrm;This movie's gonna be so swank.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.680
&lrm;Stay together, right behind us.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.000
&lrm;You too, Spielberg.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.480
&lrm;[snarling]

13:39.640 --> 13:41.200
&lrm;[whimpering]

13:41.680 --> 13:42.720
&lrm;[he squeals]

13:49.200 --> 13:51.840
&lrm;Absorb their fear,
&lrm;Horrificator, feed on it!

13:52.000 --> 13:53.720
&lrm;It will give you strength.

13:53.880 --> 13:57.840
&lrm;And soon enough,
&lrm;you'll be giving me strength too.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.200
&lrm;We're better off on our own
&lrm;than with the others.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.480
&lrm;Why stay with them
&lrm;when we can hide on our own?

14:16.160 --> 14:17.240
&lrm;There!

14:19.080 --> 14:20.640
&lrm;Anyone recognise that shoe?

14:21.640 --> 14:23.120
&lrm;That's Adrien's shoe.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.600
&lrm;That's weird, there's no pink slime.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.240
&lrm;Yes, there is.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.840
&lrm;[snarling]
&lrm;[screaming]

14:35.600 --> 14:37.040
&lrm;Everybody, run!

14:38.920 --> 14:40.720
&lrm;Awesome.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
&lrm;So awesome.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.840
&lrm;[she chuckles]

14:47.160 --> 14:50.160
&lrm;[disgusted sigh]
&lrm;What's your name, Drool-ator?

14:51.400 --> 14:53.840
&lrm;Cat's aren't afraid
&lrm;of slimy toads like you.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.040
&lrm;We'd better find that Akuma.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.200
&lrm;I see nothing but miles of slime.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.720
&lrm;Help!

15:16.400 --> 15:19.120
&lrm;Fear, it's fear
&lrm;that gives it its strength.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.200
&lrm;[she screams]

15:37.960 --> 15:40.880
&lrm;[fearful cries]

15:49.640 --> 15:51.080
&lrm;[screaming]

15:51.240 --> 15:53.680
&lrm;It's taken Nath' and Alix.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.720
&lrm;The more people are scared of it
&lrm;the more powerful it gets.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.560
&lrm;By defeating fear, we defeat it.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.640
&lrm;First we've got to get out
&lrm;of this sticky situation

16:06.800 --> 16:07.920
&lrm;before it dries.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.280
&lrm;[she squeals]

16:23.520 --> 16:25.800
&lrm;Did you see how it left Ivan alone?

16:25.960 --> 16:27.840
&lrm;Yeah, what's that all about?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.960
&lrm;I think the monster is Mylene.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.720
&lrm;Where are Sabrina and Chloe?

16:32.880 --> 16:35.560
&lrm;We'll find them...
&lrm;If we can find a way out.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.720
&lrm;It's a good thing
&lrm;I come up with brilliant ideas.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.400
&lrm;No-one's gonna get through that barricade.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.360
&lrm;We can relax
&lrm;and let them do the hard work.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.880
&lrm;[Sabrina yelps]

16:49.040 --> 16:50.400
&lrm;[growling]

16:53.000 --> 16:54.920
&lrm;[screaming]

16:56.680 --> 16:57.720
&lrm;We're too late.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.720
&lrm;But look,

16:59.880 --> 17:01.640
&lrm;we can track the monster.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.240
&lrm;[Nino giggles]

17:05.400 --> 17:07.000
&lrm;Oh, yeah, I'm so amped!

17:07.160 --> 17:10.040
&lrm;-Turn you amp down, will you?
&lrm;-My bad.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.800
&lrm;Their fear will make you powerful enough

17:19.960 --> 17:21.319
&lrm;to defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.680
&lrm;Get their Miraculouses!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.079
&lrm;Anybody here?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.000
&lrm;Ladybug, it's me,

17:28.160 --> 17:29.240
&lrm;Chloe Bourgeois!

17:29.400 --> 17:31.240
&lrm;Don't worry, we'll get you out.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.160
&lrm;Well hurry up already!

17:33.320 --> 17:34.520
&lrm;Is everyone here?

17:34.680 --> 17:35.760
&lrm;[muffled] Yes!

17:35.920 --> 17:36.920
&lrm;-Mr Damocles?
&lrm;-Present.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.520
&lrm;-Alix? Nathaniel?
&lrm;-Yeah!

17:38.800 --> 17:39.680
&lrm;Adrien?

17:41.080 --> 17:42.800
&lrm;Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

17:42.960 --> 17:43.960
&lrm;[relieved sigh]

17:44.120 --> 17:45.400
&lrm;What about Marinette?

17:45.560 --> 17:47.200
&lrm;Yeah, we've got everyone.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.240
&lrm;They won't budge.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.200
&lrm;Get us out!

17:51.360 --> 17:53.120
&lrm;Calm down. We'll get you out.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.880
&lrm;[growling]

17:59.040 --> 18:00.760
&lrm;OK, now this is getting scary.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.600
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

18:11.920 --> 18:14.280
&lrm;Guitar strings, are you kidding me?

18:14.440 --> 18:16.760
&lrm;Guitar, music... Mylene's song.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.080
&lrm;That's it. Enough is enough.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.360
&lrm;Cataclysm!

18:43.800 --> 18:46.320
&lrm;[crashing]

18:56.800 --> 18:58.760
&lrm;OK, we're all going to sing.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.600
&lrm;Sing? So that's your plan.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.200
&lrm;The only way is to get
&lrm;your fear under control.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.200
&lrm;Do you all know Smelly Wolf?

19:07.360 --> 19:09.600
&lrm;Seriously? Smelly Wolf?

19:10.200 --> 19:11.640
&lrm;Care to join us?

19:17.520 --> 19:18.600
&lrm;OK, everyone,

19:18.760 --> 19:21.400
&lrm;1, 2, 3, 4,
<i>&lrm;♪ Smelly wolf, smelly wolf ♪</i>

19:21.560 --> 19:24.520
<i>&lrm;♪ Trapped in a stinky hut ♪</i>

19:24.680 --> 19:27.600

19:36.360 --> 19:38.160
&lrm;[calm growl]

19:39.800 --> 19:40.960
&lrm;Wow, it's working.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.440
&lrm;[excited squeaks]

19:51.600 --> 19:52.520
&lrm;[purring]

19:52.680 --> 19:54.560
&lrm;That's the button I gave Mylene.

19:54.720 --> 19:55.880
&lrm;That's where the Akuma is.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.840
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, Akuma.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.920
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

20:10.160 --> 20:11.240
&lrm;Gotcha!

20:12.880 --> 20:14.760
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.720
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

20:26.640 --> 20:28.160
&lrm;Pound it!

20:29.000 --> 20:30.200
&lrm;[Nino] Awesome.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.360
&lrm;You don't scare me, Ladybug!

20:32.520 --> 20:34.520
&lrm;I'll destroy you in the end,

20:34.680 --> 20:39.000
&lrm;someday, somehow... I'll destroy you!

20:44.640 --> 20:47.160
&lrm;What do you think, Mr Mayor?
&lrm;Off the hook right?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.880
&lrm;We didn't make the cut.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.640
&lrm;He said the monster
&lrm;was a horrible replica, no joke!

20:54.800 --> 20:57.720
&lrm;Don't worry,
&lrm;this is how all movie directors start.

20:58.120 --> 21:01.760
&lrm;Yeah, even if that final kiss
&lrm;wasn't quite what we expected.
