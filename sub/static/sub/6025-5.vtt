WEBVTT

00:15.160 --> 00:17.003
Fucking sketchy
neighborhood, man.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.045
You see that guy? That's Chuy Ramirez.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.088
And he's gonna do our new logo.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.881
That's the artist you were talking about?
You said he had paintings in galleries.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.646
His works hang in the
gallery of the streets.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.801
I'll be back in a flash.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.530
Whoa, no. What?

00:33.600 --> 00:35.329
Okay.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.160
Man, we're just going
to sit here like this?

00:39.600 --> 00:41.887
Oh, shit. Look at this guy.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.726
He's a scary individual.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.404
Whoa. Um...

00:47.480 --> 00:49.642
Hey, buddy.
Do you have any drugs?

00:49.720 --> 00:51.563
Please, let it up. Let it up.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.085
If you don't let it go, I can't roll it up.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.322
Just... Please, just... You fucking prick!

00:55.680 --> 00:56.727
Ow!

00:56.800 --> 00:58.080
I'm gonna beat you in your face!

00:59.400 --> 01:00.890
Chuy Ramirez?

01:00.960 --> 01:03.088
Erlich Bachman. We spoke on the phone.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.491
- What's up, man?
- Pleasure to meet you.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.561
- All right.
- Ah...

01:05.640 --> 01:07.802
This is great. Look at this.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.163
This is what we need, you know what I mean?
Something raw.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.527
We already have kind of a shitty name,
Pied Piper,

01:13.600 --> 01:16.444
but the last thing we want
is two lowercase P's in a square

01:16.520 --> 01:18.921
like those motherfuckers
across the freeway would make.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.081
This is what we want.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.083
So you gonna give me stock options or what?

01:22.160 --> 01:25.004
- What?
- Yeah. You know Dave Choe?

01:25.080 --> 01:26.889
He did all the murals over at Facebook.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.566
He got a stock option deal,
ended up making, like, $100 million.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.005
I want a deal like that.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.890
You know, I don't really speak
all that Wall Street bullshit.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.086
You know what I'm saying?

01:35.160 --> 01:38.323
We're just, like, five guys hanging out
in a house, trying to make cool shit.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.129
Well, you told me you own 10% of it.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.328
So you must know something about it, right?

01:42.400 --> 01:44.129
You could just give me some of your points.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.531
Hey, I'm not an accountant, you know?

01:45.600 --> 01:48.968
I don't even know what that means,
a lot of those words.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.008
You fucking prick!

01:59.920 --> 02:02.241
Oh, you fucker.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.926
Let me in. Please, please. I'll break this.
I don't care. I don't care.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.604
- I'll break this...
- I can't hear you.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.840
Oh, God.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.723
I can't hear you.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.244
Yeah, but you don't want
stock in our company.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.522
If I could go back in time,
I wouldn't have taken the stock.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.570
I would've taken cash only.
I'm telling you...

02:19.640 --> 02:22.325
- Who's that dude?
- Uh, nobody. He's a coder.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.209
You got a Latino working for you?

02:24.280 --> 02:27.807
That's cool, yo.
Not a lot of Latinos working in tech.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.920
Yeah. Yeah, he's Latino.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.651
Yeah. And he's one of
the best coders we have.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.609
He kind of adds a Latin
flair to the company.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.682
I told you, we do things differently.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.401
Yeah. You know what?

02:40.480 --> 02:42.960
I could do a cash deal
for a Latino company.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.166
I think we should get out of here, though,

02:44.240 --> 02:47.005
because I just painted over some dude's
shit and people get shot behind that.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.969
So I'll catch you on the flip. Peace!

02:49.040 --> 02:51.008
Uh, okay. Peace, Chuy.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.006
Oh, God. This is very real.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.367
Hey, Dinesh! Get in the fucking car.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.046
- There may be a drive-by about to happen.
- What?

03:15.960 --> 03:19.965
You promised this guy $10,000
without any approval?

03:20.040 --> 03:22.042
- Are you high?
- A little bit, yeah.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.326
But that's irrelevant.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.607
A cool company needs a cool logo.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.364
You think those guys over at Nucleus

03:27.440 --> 03:30.489
are hiring a convicted felon
to paint a mural on their garage?

03:30.560 --> 03:32.369
For $10,000? No.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.847
Look, I took a run at a burn down chart.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.801
Ugh. Jesus fucking Christ.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.606
It's not pretty.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.968
The way things are going,
we're not gonna finish for five months.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.766
And even with everyone on reduced salaries,
we'll exhaust all our funding in four.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.241
And that's without wasting
$10,000 on artwork.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.004
"Wasting"? I got a great deal.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.447
You know, he wanted stock options
until he saw Dinesh?

03:58.520 --> 04:00.488
Hold on, what?

04:00.560 --> 04:03.530
Don't be offended, but
for some weird reason,

04:03.600 --> 04:07.127
Chuy took a look at you
and thought you were a Mexican.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.810
Why would I be offended by that?

04:10.880 --> 04:11.961
What?

04:12.040 --> 04:14.486
Why would I be offended
by him thinking I'm Mexican?

04:14.560 --> 04:15.846
He's Mexican, right?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.730
Yeah, he is, but you're not.
You're Pakistani.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.130
So?

04:20.200 --> 04:25.843
Actually, the very fact that you think
this would be offensive to me is offensive.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.490
You're the one being racist.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.131
No. I'm not the one who
called you a Mexican.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.602
Called me a Mexican? You're doing it again.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.889
I'm bending over backwards
to not be racist right now.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.641
All right. Well, what did he say
when you told him I wasn't Mexican?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.444
I didn't.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.601
And why not?

04:42.680 --> 04:45.047
Because I wanted him
to paint our garage for cheap.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.450
I genuinely don't know
how to respond to that.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.010
You know, I'm not gonna take the bait here.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.650
I am not a racist, all right?

04:52.720 --> 04:57.089
I watch a lot of black porn. I mean, a lot.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.810
One question.

04:58.880 --> 05:04.330
In this porn, is the man black,
or the woman black, or are they both?

05:04.400 --> 05:07.165
Is one of those racist,
and the others aren't?

05:07.240 --> 05:09.368
I'll hack his browser history.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.487
Yep.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.562
Hold on. That's unnecessary.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.651
Hold on.

05:14.720 --> 05:15.720
Richard?

05:15.760 --> 05:17.762
Can you explain this to me?

05:17.840 --> 05:19.040
Hmm?

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
What?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.361
I just got a text from
my friend at TechCrunch.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.011
Pied Piper just got into
this year's Startup Battlefield?

05:25.080 --> 05:26.844
Oh, really? Oh, that's so cool.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.288
No. No, it isn't. We're
already seeded, Richard.

05:30.360 --> 05:33.011
Why would we enter a start-up competition
at a tech conference?

05:33.080 --> 05:36.641
I sent in the application a few months ago
and I totally forgot about it.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.165
Relax, I will withdraw.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.765
Relax?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.410
This house is chaos.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.484
I gave up a great job and stock options
at Hooli to come here

05:44.560 --> 05:46.642
because I thought Pied
Piper could be viable,

05:46.720 --> 05:49.371
but it never will be
unless we make some changes.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.569
We need to operate like a business
or we're not going to...

05:54.920 --> 05:56.046
Richard?

05:57.080 --> 05:58.081
Richard?

06:00.280 --> 06:01.691
Thanks for coming in, Nelson.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.445
Mr. Belson is very excited
to meet with you.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.808
I thought he was in Jackson Hole this week.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.360
Yes, he is. We're going to
call him up on the TeleHuman.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.646
It's amazing.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.361
It's holographic 3D teleconferencing
technology that we've acquired.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.126
It's going to feel as if Gavin
is right here in the room with you.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.089
Oh, it's him!

06:21.160 --> 06:22.400
It's him!

06:24.960 --> 06:27.406
<i>Hello, Nelson. Thanks for meeting with me.</i>

06:27.560 --> 06:29.722
Whoa. Hi. That's cool.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.802
Am I a hologram over there, too?

06:31.880 --> 06:34.531
<i>What? No, of course not.</i>

06:34.600 --> 06:37.524
<i>Question. Do you still
talk to Richard Hendricks?</i>

06:37.640 --> 06:38.687
Uh...

06:38.760 --> 06:41.604
Yeah. I mean,
not about Nucleus or anything...

06:41.680 --> 06:44.331
<i>Why would he enter Pied Piper
in TechCrunch Disrupt?</i>

06:44.400 --> 06:48.041
<i>I know a lot of big players have come out
of it, Dropbox, Yammer, what have you.</i>

06:48.120 --> 06:50.088
<i>But Peter Gregory's already funding him.</i>

06:50.160 --> 06:52.925
<i>Why would he let Richard do this?
It makes no sense.</i>

06:53.000 --> 06:55.731
I don't know.
I didn't even know Richard got in.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.768
<i>Is Peter Gregory toying with me?</i>

06:57.840 --> 06:59.763
<i>Is he trying to make Richard seem folksy?</i>

06:59.840 --> 07:02.002
<i>Like some aw-shucks boy-genius</i>

07:02.080 --> 07:04.651
<i>entering an even/man's competition?</i>

07:04.720 --> 07:06.324
Mr. Belson?

07:06.400 --> 07:07.925
- Can you hear me?
- Hello?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.287
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, it's just... It's sort of fading.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.850
- Hello?
- Hello.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.048
<i>Hello?</i>

07:14.160 --> 07:16.891
- I'm hearing you. It's just the image is...
- Nelson, <i>shut up</i> for a second-.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.611
<i>If you can hear me, make a gesture.</i>

07:19.680 --> 07:22.081
Is that... Do you... I hear you. Is this...

07:22.160 --> 07:23.730
<i>I have no idea what you're saying, Nelson.</i>

07:23.800 --> 07:26.007
<i>Nelson. Nelson. Can you help me, please?</i>

07:31.200 --> 07:33.441
<i>Okay, I think what happened was
when you set it up, you forgot</i> to...

07:33.520 --> 07:36.364
<i>I didn't set it up.
I paid one of you people to set it up.</i>

07:36.880 --> 07:38.211
<i>Just fix it.</i>

07:38.320 --> 07:40.004
<i>Uh... Okay.</i>

07:41.760 --> 07:44.411
<i>Here's the thing, it's not working.</i>

07:44.800 --> 07:45.801
<i>Um...</i>

07:45.880 --> 07:47.882
<i>The audio's still working.
You could just use that.</i>

07:47.960 --> 07:50.327
<i>"The audio is working"? Excuse me?</i>

07:50.400 --> 07:53.643
<i>I paid 20 million fucking dollars
to acquire this company.</i>

07:53.720 --> 07:55.449
<i>Fuck you, "the audio is working"!</i>

07:55.520 --> 07:57.921
<i>Audio worked 100 fucking years ago!</i>

07:58.000 --> 08:00.401
<i>You fucking piece of shit...</i>

08:04.200 --> 08:06.009
- it appears we've lost him.
- Yeah.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.481
- Why don't we just try Hooli-Chat instead?
- Yeah.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.811
<i>Ah, that's better. Sorry.</i>

08:14.880 --> 08:17.087
<i>The TeleHuman is a great
piece of technology.</i>

08:17.160 --> 08:20.209
<i>Unfortunately, the broadband
isn't that great out here in rural Wyoming.</i>

08:20.280 --> 08:22.921
<i>- That presents</i> a <i>great
business opportunity...</i>

08:24.760 --> 08:27.411
<i>Nelson, make</i> a <i>gesture... hear me.</i>

08:27.720 --> 08:29.609
Oh, for fuck's <i>sake.</i>

08:31.920 --> 08:35.845
<i>Uh... l think you forgot
to update your software.</i>

08:35.919 --> 08:39.082
God damn it.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.851
Oh.

08:47.880 --> 08:48.927
Hello?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.081
Oh, hi, Gavin.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.410
What's that? I'm sorry, you're
kind of breaking up there.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.761
Hello? Hello?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.889
Okay, let's start the meeting.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.008
I think we need to define
our corporate culture.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.450
Our whole corporate culture
is that we don't have a corporate culture.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.363
That is totally ridiculous, Gilfoyle.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.171
The main reason dogs are perceived
to have a more keen sense of smell

09:11.240 --> 09:12.844
is because their noses
are closer to the ground.

09:12.920 --> 09:17.050
Therefore, with a little practice, I could
easily have as keen a sense of smell as a dog's.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.049
Guys? I guess you didn't see the sign.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.561
We're actually having a meeting here.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.926
Congratulations.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.122
It's sort of for management only.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.130
Are you fucking serious right now?
Are you really kicking us out?

09:32.200 --> 09:35.044
Well, I thought, maybe you guys could just
take your food into the living room.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.640
So you want to have a meeting
in the room where all the food is,

09:37.680 --> 09:39.921
while we eat our food
in the room where all the computers are?

09:40.000 --> 09:43.083
Guys, just five minutes. Please?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.646
Okay, you see? This is a case in point.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.566
This is a company, and yet we have
no boundaries and no protocol.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.486
We need to establish a clear corporate
culture or we're not gonna make it.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.483
Take Dinesh and Gilfoyle.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.484
They are wasting
an enormous amount of time arguing.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.161
What if we were to separate them, right?

10:07.200 --> 10:10.124
Divide their existing work space
into two areas.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.089
We could put in
some kind of portable barrier...

10:12.160 --> 10:13.969
He's talking about cubicles!

10:14.040 --> 10:15.804
We are not doing cubicles.
No way!

10:15.880 --> 10:17.760
No, no, no, no. Don't
think of it as a cubicle.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.804
Just think of it as a, uh,
neutral-colored enclosure,

10:20.880 --> 10:23.281
about yay high, around your workspace.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.124
Okay, fine.
But do you know who uses cubicles?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.009
Every single Fortune 500 company.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.411
Why? Because they work.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.847
He's trying to turn us into
corporate rock, Richard.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.844
- No.
- We are punk rock.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.810
Actually, you know, I think
a better analogy would be jazz.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.247
Like we riff and improvise
around a central theme

10:44.320 --> 10:45.731
to create one cohesive piece of music.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.485
No, no. They teach fucking
jazz at Juilliard.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.483
We're not jazz. We're fucking punk rock.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.164
You see? You see?

10:52.240 --> 10:55.847
You guys are arguing over what metaphor
to use to agree with each other.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.526
This is the inefficiency
I'm trying to eliminate.

10:58.600 --> 11:03.731
My suggestions could actually
help you beat me in this argument.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.245
Do you see the irony there?

11:14.520 --> 11:17.126
I can't argue with this.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.281
Yo, Erlich!

11:18.360 --> 11:19.691
Uh, Chuy's here.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.445
No. And this is the craziest one of all.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.887
I mean, we're really about to spend $10,000

11:24.960 --> 11:28.043
on a logo
we could generate in-house for free?

11:28.120 --> 11:29.326
It's madness.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.006
You want a logo? Here.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.764
Just...

11:33.880 --> 11:37.521
There. I just saved this company $10,000.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.365
Are you fucking serious? Lowercase letters?

11:40.440 --> 11:43.523
Twitter, lowercase Google, lowercase

11:43.640 --> 11:45.529
Facebook, lowercase

11:45.640 --> 11:48.644
Every fucking company in the Valley
has lowercase letters.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.563
Why? Because it's safe.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.769
But we aren't going to do that.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.808
We're gonna go with Chuy.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.644
Unless any of you gringos
wants to go out there

11:57.720 --> 11:59.643
and tell a guy with three
assault convictions

11:59.720 --> 12:02.087
that we're not gonna give him
the money we promised him.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.402
Hmm? That's what I thought.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.482
I mean... God.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.727
Are you still enjoying your asparagus, sir?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.326
I was never enjoying it.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.483
I only eat it for the nutrients.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.925
You may take it.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.560
Oh, shit.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.249
Peter, I don't want to upset you,

12:29.320 --> 12:31.368
but Gavin Belson just walked in.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.604
Does he see us?

12:41.680 --> 12:43.921
I don't know. He must
know that you're here.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.210
If I scurry to the restroom,
do you imagine he would...

12:48.280 --> 12:50.567
Peter!

12:50.640 --> 12:52.563
I didn't know you came here.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.640
Gavin.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.370
Hello.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.009
Nice to see you.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.525
And you as well.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.201
How are you?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.763
Well.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.569
- And you?
- Not bad.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.371
I just got back from Jackson Hole.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.527
Have you been?

13:16.160 --> 13:18.527
I have not.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.443
But I hear good things.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.324
You look well.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.606
Are you exercising?

13:26.680 --> 13:28.887
I have begun to do Pilates.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.761
I hear that's good.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.211
I like it.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.406
Yes.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.641
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.010
Nice to see you, Peter.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.411
- Goodbye now.
- Okay.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.969
You know, I almost forgot.

13:54.040 --> 13:59.524
I saw that Pied Piper is in the
Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.162
It inspired me to call TechCrunch
and offer to be their keynote speaker.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.089
They were quite accommodating.

14:06.160 --> 14:11.200
Especially when I said that I'd make the
event the grand unveiling of Nucleus.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.250
So, I will see you all at the conference.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.648
This is displeasing.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.247
I have never seen him so incensed.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.084
What the hell were you thinking, Richard?

14:29.160 --> 14:32.130
How could you not tell us
that you entered TechCrunch Disrupt?

14:32.200 --> 14:34.123
I applied before I even met you guys.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.362
I wasn't gonna say anything
because I was gonna withdraw.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.125
- No, you're not.
- I'm not? Why not?

14:39.200 --> 14:43.444
Because of you, Gavin Belson
is debuting Nucleus at TCD.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.649
If you pull out, it looks like
Peter is running away from Gavin.

14:46.720 --> 14:51.442
So like it or not, you are presenting a live
demo in front of the world in eight weeks.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.170
A live demo of what?

14:53.240 --> 14:57.131
I entered TCD with an early build of Pied
Piper when it was still just a music app.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.965
No. Sorry. Executive decision.
We are not doing TechCrunch.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.442
Okay. So let me just
tell you what's gonna happen.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.286
Peter will pull all of his support
and pass on any further funding,

15:07.360 --> 15:10.091
which, as you know, is the most
flaming signaling risk on Earth.

15:10.160 --> 15:15.121
You'll burn through the rest of your runway,
no one will step in, then you'll go bust.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.770
I don't get it.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.161
Doesn't Peter Gregory
want what's best for the company?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.211
Look. I'm going to be straight with you.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.448
Peter Gregory doesn't care.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.285
- About?
- You.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.561
Wait. Just him or both of us?

15:36.640 --> 15:39.120
Any of you. Pied Piper.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.771
Okay...

15:41.840 --> 15:44.286
Uh, well, then why did he back us?

15:44.360 --> 15:47.967
Does he just want to piss off Gavin Belson?
He spent $200,000 just...

15:48.040 --> 15:50.088
Yeah, that's nothing.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.960
Peter would spend millions
just to mildly annoy Gavin.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.530
These are billionaires, Richard.

15:55.640 --> 15:59.042
Humiliating each other is worth more
to them than we'll make in a lifetime.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.806
I see.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.884
And you conveniently
forgot to mention any of this

16:04.960 --> 16:08.567
when you were convincing me
to turn down $10 million?

16:08.640 --> 16:12.087
And now I'm in the middle of some
pissing contest between two billionaires.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.170
In fairness,

16:14.240 --> 16:17.961
Gavin only offered you the $10 million
because we started pursuing you...

16:18.080 --> 16:20.560
Yeah, but he offered it to me, Monica!
He offered it to me.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.529
$10 dollars and I didn't take it.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.570
Because you came to me
when I was puking and freaking out

16:25.640 --> 16:28.484
and told me that
Peter Gregory believed in me,

16:28.560 --> 16:30.642
when in reality,
he didn't even give a flying fuck!

16:30.760 --> 16:32.046
- Richard...
- Oh, my God.

16:32.120 --> 16:36.011
I didn't turn down $10 million
because of Peter Gregory, Monica!

16:36.080 --> 16:38.082
I turned it down because of you!

16:42.160 --> 16:45.164
However angry he is, I
am one-tenth as angry.

16:48.160 --> 16:51.084
Because one of the $10 million
would've been mine.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.731
- Because I own 10%.
- I know.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.450
- Of Pied Piper.
- I know!

16:58.240 --> 16:59.685
It's push.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.560
We didn't think we were going to get this
thing done when we had five months to do it.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.601
Now we have two?

17:14.720 --> 17:16.324
Granted, it's not ideal,
but we're just gonna have to...

17:16.400 --> 17:17.685
What the good fuck?

17:17.760 --> 17:20.444
What is happening?
Is that Dinesh?

17:21.599 --> 17:23.522
Is that the Statue of Liberty?

17:23.599 --> 17:25.489
And it's...

17:25.560 --> 17:27.130
There's penetration.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.683
Oh! Hey, neighbor.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.521
- Ashley's getting big!
- Aw.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.329
She looks...

17:34.400 --> 17:36.482
- What do we do?
- I don't know. Paint over it.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.440
No, no, no. You can't paint over it.
It's, like, the code of the streets.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.164
- People get shot behind that.
- Oh, good.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.890
Hey. So what do guys think, man?

17:42.960 --> 17:44.246
Uh...

17:44.320 --> 17:46.243
I think Erlich had a few thoughts.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.766
So, I gotta...

17:49.640 --> 17:50.641
I'll let you...

17:52.080 --> 17:53.605
Uh...

17:56.080 --> 17:58.924
Here's the headline.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.129
There's a lot right with it.
A lot of good stuff in there.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.765
But I just...
Do you think the piece is working?

18:05.840 --> 18:10.926
I mean, maybe it's
a bit too graphic for the space?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.365
No way. Look at it.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.125
It comments on the whole Latino struggle
for justice in America.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.921
But even without all the symbolism,
it's just aesthetically pleasing.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.001
Yeah.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.406
All right, here's the real shit, Chuy.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.289
Uh, you know, our prize coder,

18:26.360 --> 18:29.842
he's actually not Latino.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.401
What?

18:31.480 --> 18:33.323
Yeah. Point of fact is, he's Pakistani.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.606
Homes, you lied to me.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.081
No, no, no. You thought he was Latino,

18:37.160 --> 18:40.289
and I thought that I would be racist
telling you you were wrong.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.601
Come on, man. Why would you think that?

18:42.680 --> 18:44.762
Thinking that, now that's racist.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.481
God, I can't Win with that.

18:48.560 --> 18:53.282
Look, Chuy, painting a guy
named Dinesh Chugtai as an Aztec warrior

18:53.400 --> 18:54.970
just doesn't make sense.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.441
Yeah. You know what?

18:58.520 --> 18:59.646
I think you might be right, boss.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.200
Great. That's... Um...

19:02.280 --> 19:04.328
So... Perfect. So change that

19:04.400 --> 19:08.644
and then don't have him be fucking
the literal symbol of freedom.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.961
And then, whatever else you wanna do.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.088
- All right.
- All right.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.166
If I had known, we could have withdrawn your
application before any of this happened.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.891
This is exactly why we need to have
clearer lines of communication.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.485
I know, Jared, I know.

19:22.560 --> 19:27.441
Listen, I'd like to institute
an organizational system called Scrum.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.766
Scrum is designed to...

19:28.840 --> 19:30.649
All right, you have one hour! Go!

19:30.920 --> 19:32.922
No.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.206
No. Just musty.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.645
Uh, what's going on?

19:35.720 --> 19:37.165
Gilfoyle bet me 100 bucks

19:37.280 --> 19:40.124
that if I touched one object in this room,
he could find it just by sniffing.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.004
Okay. Not now, please.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.368
No, it has to be now.
I just masturbated to heighten my focus.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.010
I have a 15-minute refractory period.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.885
- Ow.
- Uh, well, we have a lot of work to get done.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.365
So maybe we should do that instead, please?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.521
Dude, relax, okay?

19:52.600 --> 19:54.364
We each ripped through
a full module this morning.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.761
We're just taking a little break.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.081
DRM is now a thing of beauty.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.130
- Wait. You did DRM?
- Yeah.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.326
I did DRM.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.811
Why did you do DRM?

20:03.880 --> 20:05.882
I said I would do DRM,
you would do error handling.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.123
Anything to do with "error"
sounds like your whole vibe.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.201
Yeah, I handle
errors like you every day.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.281
Scrum?

20:11.360 --> 20:13.966
- Yes, Scrum.
- Scrum.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.848
So from "rules based filtering,"
we go to "workflow,"

20:17.920 --> 20:20.730
at which point that card
is moved from the "icebox"

20:20.800 --> 20:25.283
into the "in progress" column and it stays
there until it is ready for "testing."

20:25.360 --> 20:28.603
Okay. This increases visibility
into our team's progress.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.331
And that, gentlemen, is Scrum.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.328
Welcome to the next eight
weeks of our lives.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.289
This just became a job.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.007
Okay, so here are the cards

20:39.080 --> 20:41.811
I'm adding under this epic
for the ingestion engine.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.530
And there are three stories here.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.884
How long do we think each one will take?

20:46.960 --> 20:49.122
I don't know. Who cares?

20:49.200 --> 20:50.486
Four hours apiece?

20:50.600 --> 20:52.284
Yeah. Maybe for you.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.840
Each one of those tasks
would take me three max.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.604
Not "tasks," "stories."

20:56.680 --> 20:58.842
I've got a story.
Why don't you choke on my balls?

20:58.920 --> 21:00.490
Well, how about this?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.767
Why don't you each take one story, right?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.201
Okay.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.487
And we'll see who's right.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.289
You see what he's doing, right?

21:09.360 --> 21:12.443
He's trying to get us to compete
so we work faster.

21:12.520 --> 21:17.765
He thinks this wall of Psych 101,
MBA, mind control bullshit

21:17.880 --> 21:19.211
is going to motivate us.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.204
Fine. Don't compete.
Do them at whatever speed you like.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.008
Uh, Jared.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.170
Uh...

21:28.240 --> 21:29.730
I know these guys.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.690
I really don't think Scrum
is gonna work for them.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.762
Whoa... Just trust in the system.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.969
So we're just going to work at
a nice, leisurely pace, right?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.610
Sure.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.125
Wait, why are you typing faster?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.486
I'm not.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.643
Maybe my leisurely pace
is just a little faster than yours.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.248
Cocksucker.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.723
Boo-yah.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.281
Guys, have you been out front yet?

21:59.360 --> 22:00.486
'Cause you might wanna come see this.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.006
- I'm good.
- Fuck off, we're working.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.361
Wow.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.522
This took a lot of work.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.489
I mean, I'm already smiling.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.767
Did he really have to paint me
giving the thumbs-up?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.205
It's gratuitous.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.805
Really? That's the gratuitous part?

22:13.880 --> 22:15.689
Well, and Dinesh's shaft...

22:15.760 --> 22:17.171
- Oh, no.
- Uh...

22:17.240 --> 22:19.049
Oh shit.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.924
Are one of you the homeowner?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.365
Yeah, I am.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.171
We've had a number of complaints
about your artwork here.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.851
Look, what you do inside the house
is your own business...

22:29.920 --> 22:31.968
- Oh, no. We don't do that.
- Oh, no...

22:32.040 --> 22:35.044
But that is you, is it not?
The individual on the right?

22:35.760 --> 22:36.761
Yeah.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.205
You're gonna need to paint over this.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.204
Oh, I don't think the artist
would like that. He's Latino.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.327
Hmm.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.401
Was that racist?

22:44.120 --> 22:45.281
Why are you asking me?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.047
Oh...

22:47.120 --> 22:49.248
I mean, I could've asked anybody,
but you're...

22:49.320 --> 22:51.288
it doesn't matter.
I have a solution.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.800
We put it up.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.365
We don't put it down. Leave it up.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.965
No, no, no. No, no, no! Close it!

22:56.040 --> 22:57.769
No...

22:59.640 --> 23:03.725
Look at this, left from
the previous tenant.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.800
Unbelievable.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.844
I can't believe
I didn't enter the garage until this point.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.285
I mean, is that marijuanas?

23:09.360 --> 23:11.522
We're gonna need to take those.

23:11.600 --> 23:16.527
Or we leave them and wait to see if the
criminal returns to the scene of the crime.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.244
What do you say, please?

23:21.320 --> 23:24.085
Okay. So I keep the mural,
and I keep the 10 G's.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.366
What do you get?

23:25.440 --> 23:29.525
I just thought when I got a new garage door,
maybe you could come and paint a new logo.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.161
Something just as artistic,
but maybe a little less challenging.

23:33.240 --> 23:37.290
Hey! Don't look under there.
Get away from there!

23:37.360 --> 23:38.441
That's not me.

23:41.640 --> 23:46.931
Um, just to be honest with you,
I really, really, really need this.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.970
So, I'm trying to be
vulnerable in front of you.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.849
I don't know. Is this a safe place?

23:52.640 --> 23:55.928
Look, you can be vulnerable, ese,
but this ain't a safe place.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.560
A plumber got stabbed just last week
right where you're standing.

23:58.600 --> 23:59.806
What? Jesus Christ!

23:59.880 --> 24:02.201
What... Why would you stab a plumber?

24:04.080 --> 24:07.846
All right. It was worth a try.
Thanks anyway, Chuy.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.290
Wait.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.966
Just go ahead and leave the mural.
I like looking at it.

24:13.040 --> 24:16.044
And plus, I think I know what kind of logo
you white boys might like.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.043
Uh, that's amazing. Thank you, Chuy!

24:18.120 --> 24:20.885
- Uh, yeah. Appreciate it.
- All right, man.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.530
- Yes, one of those, too.
- All right.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.525
Another one down.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.365
Did you really?

24:30.440 --> 24:32.488
You still working on that last one?

24:32.560 --> 24:34.608
Take your time. There's no rush, Dinesh.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.884
Feeling pretty happy about yourself?

24:41.560 --> 24:43.244
I'm pretty happy with ourself.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.449
Hello?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.887
Hey, is Richard here?

24:52.280 --> 24:53.281
I don't know.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.806
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.011
Come to check up on your investment?

24:59.080 --> 25:01.765
Listen, you were right.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.922
I played you a little.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.445
Maybe a lot.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.809
I got caught up in making the deal.

25:07.880 --> 25:12.169
All right? And I would like to say that
I was just doing my job,

25:12.280 --> 25:14.521
but that's the excuse that the Nazis used,

25:14.600 --> 25:16.841
so I'm not really sure
how effective that one is.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.285
Your point being?

25:19.520 --> 25:21.682
I'm sorry.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.649
But I'm also not sorry.

25:23.720 --> 25:26.041
The reason I pushed Peter to seed you is,

25:26.120 --> 25:28.566
I think you have
an unbelievably good platform.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.803
Way better than the rest of
his other compression plays,

25:31.880 --> 25:34.360
which I apologize for
not telling you about.

25:35.720 --> 25:38.963
Look, I know eight weeks
isn't a lot of time to get this ready,

25:39.040 --> 25:41.725
but I get the feeling you're
the kind of guy that does better

25:41.800 --> 25:43.325
when there's a fire lit under his ass.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.642
It's a pretty big fire.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.609
It is.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.648
And by the way,

25:50.720 --> 25:54.964
you're the only one of Peter's companies that
I've invested 10% of my annual salary in.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.286
So I really hope that you can do this.

25:59.680 --> 26:02.081
Uh, well, I don't know how.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.810
I guess we'll find out.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.524
I saw the logo out front.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.001
I didn't know it was, uh...

26:13.080 --> 26:15.401
Cool. Guys, the new logo!

26:18.120 --> 26:19.360
Can we please both go?

26:20.240 --> 26:21.765
You go first.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.561
I love it.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.448
Well, it's lowercase,

26:32.520 --> 26:34.124
but at least it isn't racist.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.446
Is it?

26:37.520 --> 26:38.726
It's Chuy Ramirez?

26:38.800 --> 26:42.486
I'm impressed. He sold a mural
today for a half-million bucks.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.883
It wasn't on a garage door, was it?

26:49.440 --> 26:51.966
You don't think
it's too incendiary for the offices?

26:52.040 --> 26:56.090
Gavin, you got where you are
by challenging sensibilities.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.525
You know me well.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.129
It is pretty raunchy, though.
