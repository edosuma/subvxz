WEBVTT

00:01.449 --> 00:06.072
And so, due to one
architectural oversight,

00:03.664 --> 00:05.465
the Toledo Bridge Disaster
of 1906

00:06.396 --> 00:08.900
claimed the lives of 75 people.

00:08.901 --> 00:12.104
Now, I hate to stop
while I'm on a roll,

00:12.105 --> 00:14.542
but happy Halloween, ya crazies!

00:16.011 --> 00:17.644
Hey, Professor Brosby,

00:17.645 --> 00:19.480
you gonna come get beers
with us later?

00:19.481 --> 00:20.749
Nah, I got a thing.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.950
But you kids have fun
trick or treating.

00:22.951 --> 00:24.118
This is a treat.

00:24.119 --> 00:26.521
You're the coolest,
Professor Mosby.

00:26.522 --> 00:27.722
Well, hot dog.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.690
<i>Did it hurt?</i>

00:29.691 --> 00:30.691
What?

00:30.692 --> 00:32.125
Getting that kid's nose

00:32.125 --> 00:34.427
surgically removed
from your ass.

00:34.428 --> 00:38.364
It's not her nose that's in
my ass, Lily, it's her heart.

00:38.365 --> 00:40.565
My class loves me;
I-I'm really making

00:40.566 --> 00:42.500
an impression
on those guys.

00:43.937 --> 00:45.971
I'd like to make impression
on those guys.

00:45.972 --> 00:48.708
Man, I love the office
Halloween party.

00:48.709 --> 00:51.912
It is so much sluttier
than the office Christmas party.

00:51.913 --> 00:53.448
Though not as freaky

00:53.449 --> 00:55.851
as the office President's
Day Rave.

00:55.852 --> 00:58.955
Or the office Tu B'Shvat
Pajama Jammy-Jam.

00:59.724 --> 01:01.390
Hey, guys.
Hey, Boss.

01:01.391 --> 01:03.027
Hey, Randy.
Uh, you want a beer?

01:03.028 --> 01:04.760
Oh, no, thank you.
I brew my own.

01:04.762 --> 01:05.762
At the risk of bragging,

01:05.763 --> 01:08.299
my Hazelnut Pilsner
won fourth prize

01:08.300 --> 01:09.767
at the Weehawken Retirement Home

01:09.768 --> 01:12.303
Clam Bake and Wheelchair
Maintenance Picnic.

01:12.304 --> 01:15.239
I wouldn't consider any
part of that bragging.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.774
Hey, it just occurred to me,
is your friend--

01:17.775 --> 01:19.509
what's her name?--
Garbin, Flabin...

01:19.510 --> 01:21.044
Robin?
Robin.
That's it, yeah.

01:21.045 --> 01:23.346
Is she gonna be here?
Oh, not that I really care.

01:23.347 --> 01:24.981
Robin has another
party to go to.

01:24.982 --> 01:26.482
No! Damn it!

01:26.483 --> 01:28.185
I'm leaving.

01:28.186 --> 01:29.353
But she might stop by later.

01:29.354 --> 01:31.588
I guess I can
hang out a little longer.

01:37.729 --> 01:40.331
So, anyone going to see
the Halloween parade?

01:40.332 --> 01:43.400
<i>Oh, we were big fans of New</i>
<i>York's annual Halloween parade.</i>

01:43.401 --> 01:45.068
<i>I don't mean the one</i>
<i>that takes place</i>

01:45.069 --> 01:46.636
<i>Halloween night</i>
<i>in the Village.</i>

01:46.637 --> 01:49.005
I mean the one that takes place
<i>the morning of November 1st--</i>

01:49.006 --> 01:52.509
<i>the Annual Post Halloween</i>
<i>Walk of Shame Parade.</i>

01:52.510 --> 01:54.277
Look at them
heading home

01:54.278 --> 01:56.846
after their
dirty, filthy hookups.

01:56.847 --> 02:00.182
Looks like
that bee got busy.

02:01.685 --> 02:04.453
Looks like that French maid
didn't turn down somebody's bed.

02:04.454 --> 02:07.924
Oh, looks like Pocahontas
has a couple of wounded knees.

02:07.925 --> 02:09.758
Come on, Marshall.
That's a line.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.761
No, it's because of the...
We get it.

02:11.762 --> 02:13.630
Does it get any better
than this?

02:13.631 --> 02:15.766
Uh, yes.

02:15.767 --> 02:17.635
Yes, it does.

02:20.271 --> 02:22.072
Crap.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.774
I don't want to
talk about it.

02:45.775 --> 02:47.242
Please tell me
you're not hooking up

02:47.243 --> 02:48.811
with one of your
co-anchors again.

02:48.812 --> 02:50.379
My co-anchor's a woman.
Please tell me
you are hooking up

02:50.380 --> 02:51.714
with one of your
co-anchors again.

02:51.715 --> 02:53.583
<i>Robin had</i>

<i>that the key to success</i>

02:56.887 --> 02:59.088
<i>Her new co-anchor Becky</i>

<i>It's the Farhampton Boat Show!</i>

03:07.731 --> 03:09.198
<i>Remember 5th, 6th and 7th</i>

03:09.199 --> 03:10.866

03:10.867 --> 03:12.167
Boats! Boats! Boats!

03:12.168 --> 03:13.635
<i>Come on down.</i>

03:13.636 --> 03:16.004
B-B-B-Boats!

03:17.240 --> 03:18.874
You did a commercial?

03:18.875 --> 03:20.176
Why not?

03:20.177 --> 03:21.210
You're a journalist!

03:21.211 --> 03:23.045
Don't you want
to be taken seriously?

03:23.046 --> 03:24.480
No. I'm cute.

03:24.481 --> 03:26.082
Okay, well, if you
really think

03:26.083 --> 03:27.950
this is going to
help your image.

03:27.951 --> 03:30.920
Hi, Becky. Boats, boats, boats!

03:31.988 --> 03:35.090
Robin, a little help here?

03:35.091 --> 03:36.792
Aw...
Oh...
Robin,

03:36.793 --> 03:38.994
you gotta not worry so much
about being liked.

03:38.995 --> 03:40.430
Oh, easy for you to say.

03:40.431 --> 03:42.031
Everybody loves you
at your job.

03:42.032 --> 03:44.066
Mm.
<i>That was true</i>
<i>of my teaching job.</i>

03:44.067 --> 03:46.603
<i>But I was also designing</i>
<i>the new headquarters</i>

03:46.604 --> 03:48.438
<i>for Goliath National Bank,</i>
<i>and well...</i>

03:48.439 --> 03:51.842
Ted Mosby, we don't like you!

03:51.843 --> 03:53.577
What do you have to say
for yourself,

03:53.578 --> 03:55.145
tearing down a beautiful,
old building

03:55.146 --> 03:57.281
just to put up a stupid
band headquarters?

03:57.282 --> 03:58.482
Hmm...

03:58.483 --> 03:59.883
Boo...

03:59.884 --> 04:01.285
freakin'...

04:01.286 --> 04:02.553
hoo.

04:02.554 --> 04:04.888
Boo freakin' hoo? That's it?

04:05.557 --> 04:06.724
The Arcadian

04:06.725 --> 04:08.792
is an architecturally
significant...

04:08.793 --> 04:10.628
Architecturally significant?!

04:10.629 --> 04:12.797
Zoey, you're very pretty.

04:12.798 --> 04:14.098
Your hair smells great.

04:14.099 --> 04:16.100
Shampoo.
You should try it sometime.

04:16.101 --> 04:18.769
You don't know the first thing
about architecture.

04:18.769 --> 04:21.105
Key Ted Mosby's car.

04:21.106 --> 04:22.573
Go on.

04:22.574 --> 04:23.974
I'm a professor, okay?

04:23.975 --> 04:26.744
I teach this stuff at one of the
best colleges in the country.

04:26.745 --> 04:28.846
I don't go down
to your place of non-employment

04:28.847 --> 04:31.015
and lecture you
about how your little protest

04:31.016 --> 04:32.716
is a misguided waste of time,

04:32.717 --> 04:34.618
except whoops, I just did.

04:34.619 --> 04:35.919
Ha-burn.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.489
Oh, good, the eggs are here.
Well, I should head up.

04:38.490 --> 04:40.524
<i>No, GNB was not popular.</i>

04:40.525 --> 04:42.626
<i>That's why every year they</i>
<i>produced a feel-good video</i>

04:42.627 --> 04:44.028
<i>to improve the bank's image.</i>

04:44.029 --> 04:46.129
GNB ANNOUNCER: <i>What makes</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank</i>

04:46.130 --> 04:47.564
different from other big banks?

04:47.565 --> 04:49.632
<i>Here at GNB, we care.</i>

04:49.633 --> 04:53.236
I care about our precious Earth.

04:54.071 --> 04:57.840
I care about old people.

04:57.841 --> 05:01.276
I care about high-yield
offshore investments.

05:01.277 --> 05:02.811
And so does Tugboat here.

05:02.812 --> 05:04.979
Isn't that right, Tugboat?
Yeah.

05:05.814 --> 05:08.082
Okay, get that camera
out of my face

05:08.083 --> 05:10.317
before I flip you
like a cheese omelet.

05:10.318 --> 05:11.786
All you have to do is say

05:11.787 --> 05:15.323
"I care about
making dreams come true."

05:15.324 --> 05:18.093
First of all, that line
makes me sound like a hooker

05:18.094 --> 05:20.796
and saying it makes me
feel like a hooker, so.

05:20.797 --> 05:22.298
Everyone is in this video.

05:22.299 --> 05:24.434
Randy's in the video.

05:24.435 --> 05:26.937
I don't want to brag,
but in 29 takes,

05:26.938 --> 05:28.438
I only threw up thrice.

05:28.439 --> 05:31.909
Wait. Randy, did you send the
Hermanson contracts downtown?

05:31.910 --> 05:33.010
I did.

05:33.011 --> 05:34.578
I sent them downtown.

05:34.579 --> 05:35.980
Why are you saying it like that?

05:35.981 --> 05:37.581
They never arrived
at the downtown office.

05:37.582 --> 05:38.782
They...

05:38.783 --> 05:41.085
Well, just to make sure
we're on the same page,

05:41.086 --> 05:42.353
is "send them downtown"

05:42.354 --> 05:44.721
not an expression
for shredding a document?

05:45.523 --> 05:46.656
You shredded them?!

05:46.657 --> 05:48.391
Yeah. I sent them downtown.

05:48.392 --> 05:50.093
You know, down
into the shredder.

05:50.094 --> 05:51.394
You-you feed the paper

05:51.395 --> 05:52.495
in a downwards fashion,

05:52.496 --> 05:54.163
so that's where the expression
comes from.

05:54.164 --> 05:55.264
That's not an expression!

05:55.265 --> 05:56.699
That has never
been an expression!

05:56.700 --> 05:57.867
Okay, I can fix this.

05:57.868 --> 05:59.502
I am all over this project.

06:02.106 --> 06:03.840
I'll say this:

06:03.841 --> 06:05.810
There is no quit in that guy.

06:05.811 --> 06:07.011
You should fire him.

06:07.012 --> 06:08.880
Okay, that, that right there.

06:08.881 --> 06:11.182
That attitude is exactly why
I won't be in your video.

06:11.183 --> 06:12.951
Because GNB doesn't care.

06:12.952 --> 06:14.986
They hand out pink slips
like they're hors d'oevres.

06:14.987 --> 06:17.255
Just last week,
I was talking to Arthur...

06:17.256 --> 06:20.391
Oh, whoa, you're wearing
a green tie now.

06:20.392 --> 06:22.359
I'm wearing a green tie.

06:23.628 --> 06:25.996
GNB treats people like
they're disposable,

06:25.997 --> 06:28.031
and I will not be
a part of that.

06:28.032 --> 06:32.234
Marshall Eriksen
does not fire people, period.

06:32.235 --> 06:34.135
Uh, just want you to know,

06:34.136 --> 06:36.872
we are making good progress
on this new project.

06:37.841 --> 06:39.241
Oh, you gentlemen
keep talking,

06:39.242 --> 06:40.976
I will answer that.

06:40.977 --> 06:42.577
Marshall Eriksen's office.

06:42.578 --> 06:44.079
Yeah, I can get that for you.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.580
Just a second.

06:48.118 --> 06:50.820
Uh... bank.
The "B" stands for bank.

06:50.821 --> 06:52.921
Okay, Mother, I'll see you
tonight.

06:52.922 --> 06:55.624
Oh, yikes. I'd better
get Mr. Messy a napkin.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.768
Period.

07:05.769 --> 07:07.670
Just tell me who
you slept with!

07:07.671 --> 07:09.572
Lily, I don't want
to get into it, okay?

07:09.573 --> 07:11.975
Aha, it's someone we know.

07:11.976 --> 07:13.977
If it was some ding dong
we didn't know,

07:13.978 --> 07:15.178
you'd just give me his name.

07:15.179 --> 07:18.648
Fine. It's Bill Pepper.

07:18.649 --> 07:19.883
Bill Pepper?

07:19.884 --> 07:21.184
Mm-hmm.

07:21.185 --> 07:23.353
Kind of a coincidence
there happens

07:23.354 --> 07:25.655
to be a bill and a pepper
shaker here on the table.

07:25.656 --> 07:29.793
Any chance you and Bill had a
three-way with Fork Napkin?

07:29.794 --> 07:30.960
Oh...

07:30.961 --> 07:33.330
It's someone we know!

07:33.331 --> 07:36.633
So, I'm assuming
you all read the chapters

07:36.634 --> 07:38.169
on the Greek Revival
architecture.

07:38.170 --> 07:39.103
Any questions?

07:39.104 --> 07:41.271
Yes.
How do you sleep at night?

07:44.399 --> 07:46.733
What are you doing here?
It was recently made clear to me

07:46.734 --> 07:48.835
that I don't know the first
thing about architecture,

07:48.836 --> 07:50.804
so here I am.

07:52.854 --> 07:55.323
Very well, then,
let's get started.

07:56.512 --> 07:58.613
Some examples of Greek Revival
architecture...

07:58.614 --> 07:59.581
Ooh! Ooh!

07:59.582 --> 08:02.318
Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?

08:02.319 --> 08:04.420
No.

08:04.421 --> 08:06.890
What's The Arcadian?

08:06.891 --> 08:09.159
Oh, it's just this
beautiful, old building

08:09.160 --> 08:11.428
that Professor Mosby
wants to tear down.

08:11.429 --> 08:12.563
What?! No,

08:12.564 --> 08:14.531
Professor Mosby
loves old buildings.

08:14.532 --> 08:16.467
He wouldn't do that.
Right, Ted?

08:18.303 --> 08:20.604
Getting back to Greek Revival...

08:21.672 --> 08:22.938
I lost them.

08:22.939 --> 08:24.707
Look, you're new at teaching.

08:24.708 --> 08:25.908
In my kindergarten class,

08:25.909 --> 08:28.577
I have had plenty
of troublesome students.

08:28.578 --> 08:30.912
Like Johnny Marley...

08:34.349 --> 08:35.783
Johnny?

08:36.518 --> 08:38.019
Johnny!

08:38.020 --> 08:42.222
He and that little stuffed
horsey raised all kinds of hell.

08:42.224 --> 08:45.593
But I have a simple method for
shutting down troublemakers.

08:45.594 --> 08:48.763
You know that '98 Taurus
that's always parked outside?

08:48.764 --> 08:50.898
The one with the really
annoying alarm?

08:52.000 --> 08:58.074

09:00.308 --> 09:02.343
We're familiar with it.

09:02.344 --> 09:05.312
Well, when a kid like Johnny
acts up in my class...

09:17.025 --> 09:19.159
Shuts them right up.
Lily,

09:19.160 --> 09:21.495
my students are adults,
and I treat them that way.

09:21.496 --> 09:24.197
I'll just give them more candy
and make them a mix CD.

09:24.198 --> 09:25.766
Problem solved.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.768
Oh, baby, what's wrong?

09:28.637 --> 09:31.339
Something bad happened.

09:31.340 --> 09:34.242
Randy, hey, have you seen the...

09:34.243 --> 09:35.643
Before you get to that,

09:35.644 --> 09:37.912
regarding the earlier project
I was working on...

09:37.913 --> 09:39.347
Voilà!

09:39.348 --> 09:40.782
That's the Hermanson contract?

09:40.783 --> 09:42.350
The Hermanson contract?

09:42.351 --> 09:44.986
Oh, man, this is
the Filbert contract.

09:44.987 --> 09:47.389
Damn it!
No...

09:47.390 --> 09:49.691
Anyway, what's your thing?

09:49.692 --> 09:51.426
I need the Filbert contract!

09:51.427 --> 09:53.595
No!!

09:55.364 --> 09:57.833
Well, I'll do what I can.

09:57.834 --> 10:02.138
But in my experience, twice
shredded is fairly permanent.

10:02.139 --> 10:05.576
Sorry, Randy, but...

10:05.577 --> 10:07.644
this just isn't working out.

10:07.645 --> 10:10.581
Marshall popped his cherry!
Oh!

10:10.582 --> 10:13.751
Come on, Marshall, you have to
admit, the guy was a disaster.

10:13.752 --> 10:16.154
I mean, it reflected badly
on the company.

10:16.155 --> 10:18.523
He was an embarrassment.

10:18.524 --> 10:19.891
A huge embarrassment.

10:19.892 --> 10:22.394
You slept with Randy!

10:22.395 --> 10:23.562
What?!

10:23.563 --> 10:26.431
Why, it's elementary,
my dear Scherbatson.

10:26.432 --> 10:29.134
<i>Your co-host</i>
<i>is getting super-popular</i>

10:29.135 --> 10:31.003
<i>because of her stupid</i>
<i>commercial,</i>

10:31.004 --> 10:32.471
<i>"Boats! Boats! Boats!"</i>

10:32.472 --> 10:35.374
So, when you arrived at the GNB
<i>party after we left,</i>

10:35.375 --> 10:38.510
<i>you were feeling vulnerable</i>
<i>and drunk.</i>

10:38.511 --> 10:42.414
<i>Then, from across the</i>
<i>not-so-crowded conference room,</i>

10:42.415 --> 10:44.450
<i>your eyes met.</i>

10:48.888 --> 10:50.689
<i>And as we all remember...</i>

10:50.690 --> 10:52.057
<i>Randy has a unique condition.</i>

10:52.058 --> 10:55.428
Yeah, your nose is bleeding
like a faucet.

10:55.429 --> 10:58.131
Oh, God, this happens
every time I get an erection.

10:58.132 --> 10:59.465
I am so sorry.

11:02.436 --> 11:03.770
That's...

11:05.373 --> 11:07.308
...exactly what happened.

11:07.309 --> 11:08.309
See, Marshall,

11:08.310 --> 11:10.577
if getting fired
is an execution,

11:10.578 --> 11:12.947
at least the guy
had a last meal.

11:12.948 --> 11:14.115
I promise you,

11:14.116 --> 11:15.950
tomorrow you'll feel
a lot better.

11:17.486 --> 11:19.720
Randy, hey, what's going on?

11:19.721 --> 11:22.188
I just wanted to say
no hard feelings.

11:22.189 --> 11:24.224
Thank you.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.192
So where you headed now?

11:29.029 --> 11:30.796
Downtown.

11:33.967 --> 11:35.501
No!!

11:36.570 --> 11:38.404
It's okay, baby.

11:38.405 --> 11:39.840
<i>It wasn't okay.</i>

11:39.841 --> 11:41.141
<i>So the next morning...</i>

11:41.142 --> 11:43.577
Arthur, I'm here
because I made a mistake.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.012
I fired Randy yesterday.

11:45.013 --> 11:46.080
That was a mistake.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.749
You should have fired him
a year ago.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.686
No, sir, that is what's
wrong with this company.

11:50.687 --> 11:52.788
How can we say "GNB Cares,"

11:52.789 --> 11:55.424
and then turn around
and treat someone like that?

11:55.425 --> 11:57.092
I mean, sure,
he made a few mistakes,

11:57.093 --> 11:58.427
but everybody makes mistakes.

11:58.428 --> 12:00.629
Like, like Tugboat here.

12:00.630 --> 12:03.132
Aw. I bet you
he's made some mistakes.

12:03.133 --> 12:05.667
And you didn't fire Tugboat,
did you?

12:05.668 --> 12:08.103
No, I got him fixed,
and he calmed down.

12:08.104 --> 12:10.172
Exactly-- kind of.

12:10.173 --> 12:11.641
Randy doesn't need to be fired.

12:11.642 --> 12:13.242
He needs to be fixed.

12:13.243 --> 12:16.546
Marshall, we do some pretty bad
things around here, but I...

12:16.547 --> 12:18.815
No, sir, I'm saying instead
of getting rid of someone

12:18.816 --> 12:22.019
when they screw up, we should...
we should help them.

12:22.787 --> 12:24.888
We should nurture them.

12:24.889 --> 12:26.357
Oh...

12:29.161 --> 12:31.296
I changed the ice pack
on his crotch

12:31.297 --> 12:33.064
every hour for three days.

12:33.065 --> 12:39.303
Wow, Eriksen, if you want to
un-fire Randy, I support you,

12:39.304 --> 12:41.604
because to come in here
and say what you just said,

12:41.605 --> 12:44.040
well, you've got a couple
things that Tugboat doesn't.

12:47.844 --> 12:51.447
Guys, Prof Rock is
a really good mix, okay?

12:51.448 --> 12:53.749
A piece of New York history
is being torn down,

12:53.750 --> 12:57.086
and all you could say
was "Boo freakin' hoo"?

12:57.087 --> 12:58.188
Boo... freakin'...

12:58.189 --> 13:00.057
I may have mentioned
our conversation

13:00.058 --> 13:01.892
over a session of hacky sack.

13:01.893 --> 13:03.861
The one day I miss
the sack circle,

13:03.862 --> 13:05.763
you guys sub her in?

13:05.764 --> 13:06.964
Why'd you miss?

13:06.965 --> 13:09.334
Too busy tearing down
the Statue of Liberty?

13:09.335 --> 13:14.440
No. I was returning a hot dog
costume that you all enjoyed.

13:15.441 --> 13:18.110
<i>They were all</i>
<i>turning against me,</i>

13:18.111 --> 13:20.111
<i>so I figured, what the hell.</i>

13:34.226 --> 13:35.193
And did it work?

13:35.194 --> 13:36.327
Like gangbusters.

13:36.328 --> 13:37.262
We're buddies again.

13:37.263 --> 13:38.964
After class, we
hacked a little sack

13:38.965 --> 13:41.100
to the thumpin' strains
of my Prof Rock CD.

13:41.101 --> 13:43.436
And no, none of them had
heard the Pixies B-side.

13:43.437 --> 13:45.739
Actually, none of them
had heard of the Pixies.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.007
Or a B-side.

13:47.008 --> 13:48.776
Hey, guys.

13:48.777 --> 13:50.344
Uh-oh. I know that smile.

13:50.345 --> 13:52.480
Lily, there's no easy way
to say this.

13:52.481 --> 13:53.715
Marshall's dead.

13:53.716 --> 13:55.283
Randy murdered him.

13:55.284 --> 13:58.086
No. I know why
Randy is smiling.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.555
You're smiling
because of Robin.

14:00.556 --> 14:03.659
Robin? Like how I think about
her when I'm in the shower?

14:03.660 --> 14:05.127
I'm trying to eat
here, buddy.

14:05.128 --> 14:08.397
No. Because you slept
with her on Halloween.

14:08.398 --> 14:10.298
What? No.

14:10.299 --> 14:13.668
I went home, had a shower
an-and went to bed.

14:13.669 --> 14:14.736
You didn't sleep with her?

14:14.737 --> 14:16.271
No.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.472
Even in the shower,

14:17.473 --> 14:19.307
the farthest we ever get
is hugging.

14:19.308 --> 14:21.843
So why are
you smiling?

14:21.844 --> 14:23.378
I'll tell you why.

14:23.379 --> 14:25.648
This just isn't working out.

14:25.649 --> 14:28.383
<i>I'm fired. Great.</i>

14:28.384 --> 14:32.221
<i>This is the candle kiosk</i>
<i>at the mall all over again.</i>

14:32.222 --> 14:33.589
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

14:33.590 --> 14:35.658
<i>I can get a severance check.</i>

14:35.659 --> 14:37.561
<i>If I don't shred it,</i>

14:37.562 --> 14:40.631
<i>I can use that money to start</i>
<i>my own brewery.</i>

14:40.632 --> 14:43.234
<i>Imagine a beer</i>
<i>with my name on it.</i>

14:43.235 --> 14:47.305
<i>Randy Wharmpiss, this is</i>
<i>the best day of your life.</i>

14:48.909 --> 14:50.776
Thanks to that severance check,

14:50.777 --> 14:52.945
this time next year,
you'll all be enjoying

14:52.946 --> 14:54.647
a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.

14:54.648 --> 14:56.615
Randy, great news!

14:56.616 --> 14:58.083
You're not fired!

15:00.554 --> 15:05.357
No...!

15:05.358 --> 15:08.727
Good morning, everybody...

15:11.931 --> 15:13.566
Where's my class?

15:16.035 --> 15:17.436
Hello, Professor.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.573
Ha-boom.

15:23.588 --> 15:25.481
I got you your
job back, Randy.

15:25.581 --> 15:27.014
I thought that you'd be happy.

15:27.015 --> 15:28.515
But I don't belong here.

15:28.516 --> 15:31.351
I'm born to be a brewer!
A... a hopsmeister!

15:31.352 --> 15:33.453
Well, then quit.
No one's stopping you.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.621
I-I can't.
I need my severance check.

15:35.622 --> 15:38.024
Well, I'm sorry Randy,
but that's called fraud.

15:38.025 --> 15:39.458
It's not fraud.

15:39.459 --> 15:40.826
I'm just asking you to get me

15:40.827 --> 15:42.194
a lot of money to not work here

15:42.195 --> 15:43.595
and not tell anyone about it.

15:43.596 --> 15:46.097
Even if I wanted to fire you,
after my talk with Arthur...

15:46.098 --> 15:48.600
Oh, come on,
Arthur can't remember that.

15:48.601 --> 15:51.169
Marshall, what a memorable
talk we had yesterday.

15:51.170 --> 15:55.607
Randy, on behalf of everyone at
GNB, both in and out of prison,

15:55.608 --> 15:57.142
we're sorry.

15:57.143 --> 15:58.610
And I want to assure you

15:58.611 --> 16:00.078
you will never
be fired again.

16:00.079 --> 16:02.514
You're going to work
here until you die, huh?

16:02.515 --> 16:03.515
Huh?

16:03.516 --> 16:04.916
Green tie?

16:06.219 --> 16:07.653
Nice choice.

16:07.654 --> 16:09.354
Thanks. It brings
out my eyes.

16:09.355 --> 16:11.857
Yeah. I'll bring
out your eyes.

16:13.359 --> 16:14.626
Listen, Randy, I'm sorry,

16:14.627 --> 16:16.394
but I broke
my own moral code once

16:16.395 --> 16:18.029
and I felt evil.

16:18.030 --> 16:19.797
I will not let GNB change me.

16:19.798 --> 16:23.900
I will never fire
anyone again ever.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.736
Oh, we'll see about that.

16:30.275 --> 16:31.241
Anyhoo, while I got you--

16:31.242 --> 16:32.709
big smile.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.845
"We care about
making dreams come true,"

16:34.846 --> 16:36.280
in three, two...

16:36.281 --> 16:38.082
No!

16:38.083 --> 16:39.150
What are you doing?

16:39.151 --> 16:41.652
Oh, are you unhappy
with my performance?

16:41.653 --> 16:43.954
Well, I guess I'm fired, then.
I'd better turn in my I.D.

16:43.955 --> 16:46.957
No, it's actually, um, nice

16:46.958 --> 16:48.760
having some of this clutter
off my desk.

16:48.761 --> 16:50.227
So thank you, Randy.

16:54.767 --> 16:56.935
And there's more.

16:58.205 --> 17:00.206
I don't know
what I'm going to use this for,

17:00.207 --> 17:01.307
but it's great stuff.

17:01.308 --> 17:02.742
Now am I fired?

17:04.010 --> 17:07.646
I've been meaning to clean out
that file cabinet for ages.

17:07.647 --> 17:08.915
I'm not even here.

17:08.915 --> 17:10.483
Randy, the coffee.

17:11.085 --> 17:12.953
Oh! Okay.

17:12.954 --> 17:14.622
Okay.

17:15.357 --> 17:17.057
Thank you, Randy.

17:17.058 --> 17:19.394
I've been meaning to cut back
on my caffeine.

17:19.395 --> 17:21.596
Here, try this,
but really go for it.

17:21.597 --> 17:23.265
Remember, this guy
ruined your life.

17:29.706 --> 17:32.207
That's just
the pick-me-up I needed.

17:33.276 --> 17:36.745
Speaking of pickups, can we try
the first one again?

17:39.182 --> 17:40.181
Hello.

17:40.182 --> 17:41.583
It didn't work. They hate me.

17:41.584 --> 17:43.651
How do I get them
to like me again?

17:43.652 --> 17:44.785
You don't.

17:44.786 --> 17:46.320
Ted, you're their teacher.

17:46.321 --> 17:48.389
The only people that
like their teachers...

17:48.390 --> 17:49.423
I like my teachers.

17:49.424 --> 17:51.024
...are dorks.

17:51.025 --> 17:52.626
Except for you, Miles.

17:55.264 --> 17:57.933
Ted, you just have to learn
to embrace their hatred.

17:57.934 --> 18:00.603
Because behind that hatred
lies fear.

18:00.604 --> 18:01.704
And you can use

18:01.705 --> 18:04.841
use that fear,
like I did with Johnny Marley.

18:04.842 --> 18:06.309
Was there more to that story?

18:06.310 --> 18:08.411
A little bit.

18:25.995 --> 18:28.829
Lily, you're a psychopath.

18:28.830 --> 18:30.031
A little bit.

18:30.032 --> 18:32.600
Oh, a panda!

18:34.870 --> 18:36.837
I thought about Lily's advice.

18:36.838 --> 18:40.942
<i>And I figured fear</i>
<i>was worth a try.</i>

18:40.943 --> 18:42.877
Well, Professor Mosby,

18:42.878 --> 18:44.479
is there anything
you want to say to us?

18:44.480 --> 18:48.884
Anyone not in class tomorrow
gets an "F."

18:51.555 --> 18:53.355
You said that?

18:53.356 --> 18:55.024
Well, technically,
they'd get an incomplete,

18:55.025 --> 18:57.627
but I thought "F" had a nice,
scary ring to it.

18:57.628 --> 18:58.695
Right?
Yeah.

18:58.696 --> 18:59.896
Hey, guys.
Hey.

18:59.897 --> 19:01.097
Robin, who'd you sleep with?

19:01.098 --> 19:02.766
I told you-- Randy.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.568
He was a machine.

19:04.569 --> 19:06.937
Where's the poop, Robin?

19:08.072 --> 19:10.907
Fine. I didn't sleep
with anyone.

19:10.908 --> 19:13.242
The thing is, ever since
Becky did that commercial,

19:13.243 --> 19:15.077
everyone at work loves her.

19:15.078 --> 19:18.180
So, the day after Halloween,
I was in a commercial.

19:18.181 --> 19:20.215
What... Why didn't you tell us?

19:21.450 --> 19:23.818
<i>Bladder trouble--</i>
<i>it's embarrassing,</i>

19:23.819 --> 19:27.021
<i>it's uncomfortable,</i>
<i>and it can affect anyone.</i>

19:27.022 --> 19:29.757
I'm going to the bathroom
right now.

19:29.758 --> 19:32.026
Neat and discreet adult diapers

19:32.027 --> 19:33.294
<i>for anyone.</i>

19:33.295 --> 19:34.496
Say...

19:34.497 --> 19:37.333
"Ah..."

19:42.506 --> 19:45.876
Wow! I can't wait to see it.

19:45.877 --> 19:47.044
Well, hopefully
you never will.

19:47.045 --> 19:49.045
They said that they
might not even use it.

19:49.046 --> 19:50.513
<i>It ran for seven years.</i>

19:53.050 --> 19:54.584
Okay, you win.

19:54.585 --> 19:57.687
Maybe trashing your office
was a mistake.

19:57.688 --> 20:00.824
It's just,
uh, as long as I can remember,

20:00.825 --> 20:03.126
making beer has been my dream.

20:04.261 --> 20:06.162
Wharmpiss?

20:07.798 --> 20:10.066
I know
it sounds dumb

20:10.067 --> 20:12.836
to someone who's already
achieved his dream--

20:12.837 --> 20:14.805
big-time lawyer
at a huge corporation.

20:14.806 --> 20:17.208
You think working here
is my dream?

20:17.209 --> 20:18.409
Of course.

20:19.244 --> 20:21.913
Anyways, I'll clean
this stuff up.

20:21.914 --> 20:24.549
Have someone get that dead
squirrel out of your desk.

20:26.886 --> 20:28.620
Randy.

20:29.888 --> 20:31.956
This is delicious.

20:33.225 --> 20:35.526
You're fired.

20:37.228 --> 20:38.595
<i>Kids, the next morning--</i>

20:38.596 --> 20:43.765
<i>my class had the highest</i>
<i>attendance it had ever had.</i>

20:43.766 --> 20:45.767
<i>And not long after that,</i>

20:45.768 --> 20:48.337
Randy used his severance money
<i>to start a little brewery.</i>

20:48.338 --> 20:52.607
<i>Now you can have a Wharmpiss</i>
<i>at every bar in America.</i>

20:52.608 --> 20:53.642
<i>And all because...</i>

20:53.643 --> 20:57.412
I care about
making dreams come true.

20:57.413 --> 20:59.581
You got what you need?

20:59.582 --> 21:01.549
Yep. That's a wrap.
