of Al-Hazred's couriers
a few weeks ago

03:27.415 --> 03:28.791

03:28.875 --> 03:30.960

Junior ain't exactly hiding

03:34.714 --> 03:36.799

All are in a section walled in

03:53.232 --> 03:55.526
Using the name
his dad made famous,

03:55.610 --> 03:58.237
Al-Hazred had built

of well-trained,
well-armed fighters.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.659
Hundreds of true believers

04:07.830 --> 04:10.291

will infil to one of the
suspected Tahara camp locations.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.297
DAVIS: Team that locates
the camp will set up an OP

04:16.381 --> 04:18.341
and wait for the other
two teams to arrive.

04:18.424 --> 04:21.344
From there, you will launch
a coordinated assault.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.179
So why don't we bomb these
locations, soften 'em up first?

04:23.262 --> 04:24.764
Ah, they're just gonna
hit their tunnels

04:24.847 --> 04:26.683

08:59.580 --> 09:01.374
Has Jason been acting
like somebody pee-peed

09:01.457 --> 09:03.000
on his carpet all deployment?

09:03.084 --> 09:05.544
Ever since we found out
about Al-Hazred Jr.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.798
Yeah, when you're hunting
the son of a man

09:08.881 --> 09:12.134
that you killed years ago,
that'd mess with my head, too.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.804
(growling, barking)

09:14.887 --> 09:17.139
(exhales)

09:17.223 --> 09:19.100
CLAY:
It's deeper than that.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.310
You know, drawdown,
plus making peace

09:21.394 --> 09:23.396
with an enemy he's been
fighting for 20 years?

09:23.479 --> 09:26.315
Got to make him question if all
the sacrifice that he's made

09:26.399 --> 09:28.317
has been worth it.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.152
Maybe he's just feeling
let down by his teammates,

09:30.236 --> 09:32.029
when he puts it all
on the line for them.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.322
SONNY:
What in the hell
you stirring up

09:33.406 --> 09:34.824
now, Thirty?

09:34.907 --> 09:36.617
THIRTY MIKE:
Clay's going to STA-21.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.996
That's a rejection of everything
Jason dedicated his life to.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.248
Same for Ray choosing
warrant officer

09:42.331 --> 09:44.375
over becoming
Bravo 1 someday.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.294
The team's evolving.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.713
Can't hold that against us.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.506
Yeah, what about this
Marsden letter business?

09:50.589 --> 09:52.216
Someone on Bravo playing
Woodward and Bernstein?

09:52.300 --> 09:56.345
Trying to make it seem like
he lost control of his team?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.514
Dude puts it
on the line

09:58.597 --> 10:01.475
for all of you guys, and
this is the thanks he gets?

10:01.559 --> 10:03.936
None of it's personal.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.813
Yeah.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.149
When the team's all you got,

10:08.232 --> 10:10.401
it has to be.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.486
(Cerberus barking)

10:12.570 --> 10:14.572
-(indistinct chatter)
-(panting)

10:16.073 --> 10:18.075
(barking)

10:18.159 --> 10:21.495
No, I asked,
why are you so pretty at work?

10:21.579 --> 10:23.831
No. Yes.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.916
(sighs)

10:27.460 --> 10:29.587
Should know better
than to try

10:29.670 --> 10:31.589
to slip anything past you,
can I, baby?

10:31.672 --> 10:34.550
Nah, we're gonna be
offline for a few days.

10:34.633 --> 10:37.219
NAIMA:
Just come home safe.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.347
That's all that matters
to anyone in this house.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.724
People in that house is
what matters to me the most.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.184
How's Jameelah doing?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.727
Counting the days
until Daddy gets home

10:44.810 --> 10:46.729
and delivers on his promise.

10:46.812 --> 10:50.191
Ugh. I will not be taking
the easy way out with her

10:50.274 --> 10:51.734
ever again,
I promise you that.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.694
I know. But for now,
just focus on you.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.113
I-I've got it all covered here.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.907
when all I...

10:57.990 --> 10:59.575
My focus was just on me?

10:59.658 --> 11:01.243
It's just... it's just hard
to believe it's been 13 years

11:01.327 --> 11:03.204
since I crawled
into that emergency room.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.914
You missing those wild days?

11:04.997 --> 11:07.917
(laughing):
No. No, no, absolutely not.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.128
I was so lost back then, baby.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.422
Oh, you made me
the man I am today.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.216
Never gonna
lose sight of that.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.468
Makes me nervous when you get
all sentimental like this.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.387
No, don't be worried.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.430
I'm just saying, I cannot wait
for this deployment to end

11:21.514 --> 11:24.433
so I can get back home and
kiss you and those babies.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.269
JASON:
So, Emma threw all of her dols
out the window?

11:27.353 --> 11:29.230
She's not even... He's not

11:29.313 --> 11:31.565
even born, and she's already
competing with him.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.902
You tell that little bundle
of joy in that tummy,

11:34.985 --> 11:37.446
do not come out for two days,
'cause in two days,

11:37.530 --> 11:39.782
I will be on a plane.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.451
Family is the priority.
Always comes first, all right?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.286
All right. I love you.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.955
(laptop closes)

11:46.038 --> 11:48.290
J. J.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.084
Want to use this, brother?
Sure you don't want to Skype?

11:50.167 --> 11:53.796
Lots to... Lots of words to
say before an op like this.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.465
No, I-I got no time
for that, Ray.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.467
No time.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.595
Hey, you sure you good, brother?

12:02.721 --> 12:04.473
Seem a little spooked.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.308
Yeah, I'm good.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.270
I'm all right.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.494
(indistinct chatter)

12:29.039 --> 12:32.168
Oh! Nice of you to join us
on this one, Hayes.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.128
Guess Mandy doesn't need
a chauffeur today.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.714
(men laugh)

12:36.797 --> 12:40.468
Yo! Just realized
this is the first time

12:40.551 --> 12:41.802
we got the whole
team back together,

12:41.886 --> 12:43.220
rolling out,
in months.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.139
Lot of moving parts
on this one.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.974
Maybe we should've
eased back into things

12:47.057 --> 12:48.976
and gotten our groove back

12:49.059 --> 12:50.644
before reenacting
Tet Offensive.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.480
You know, I can't think
of a better mission

12:52.563 --> 12:54.064
for us to have our
reunion tour on

12:54.148 --> 12:55.858
because Bravo always
gets the big ops.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.526
Pa-hew!

12:55.941 --> 12:57.526
(men laugh)

12:57.610 --> 12:59.487
Hey!

12:59.570 --> 13:00.905
Flip the switch.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.115
Focus up.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.416
RAY:
Just like Jace.
Got to make sure you good.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.877
Right? (laughs)

13:12.500 --> 13:14.877
(man laughs)

13:14.960 --> 13:18.214
Yeah, yeah. Hey, yo, Jace!

13:14.960 --> 13:18.214
MAN:
Hey!

13:18.297 --> 13:21.050
You think we'll go to the, uh,
White House after this?

13:21.133 --> 13:22.676
JASON:
What?

13:21.133 --> 13:22.676
Yeah!

13:22.760 --> 13:23.886
You know,
you know the president's

13:23.969 --> 13:25.304
gonna want
to spike the football

13:25.387 --> 13:27.765
after we put
Al-Hazred on ice.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.765
Hey, yo, I got dibs

13:27.848 --> 13:29.225
on the Lincoln Bedroom.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.434
(all laugh)

13:29.308 --> 13:30.434
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:30.518 --> 13:31.727
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
Secret Service

13:31.810 --> 13:33.062
is not gonna be
letting you creeps in.

13:33.145 --> 13:36.607
(laughs) Oh, mock all you want,
Hayes, but I know

13:36.690 --> 13:38.234
you're hoping your son
comes out just as pretty

13:38.317 --> 13:40.528
and as dangerous
as his Uncle Ray.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.528
JASON: Is that right?

13:40.611 --> 13:42.696
That's right. Yes.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.696
'Cause you are a role model,
Prime Time.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.240
RAY:
Role model, baby. That's me!

13:42.780 --> 13:44.240
Role model.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.908
(all laugh)

13:44.323 --> 13:45.908
RAY: I can see that.
You like an enigma.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.077
(laughs)

13:45.991 --> 13:48.077
Hey, your second kid's
a game changer, Jace.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.578
Twice the kids,

13:49.662 --> 13:51.413
ten times the headache.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.413
JASON:
Tell you what.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.748
Alana and I,
we want a big family.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.416
I think at least four kids.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.252
Four. Four.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.252
You better get to work, then.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.087
Four, baby!

13:56.335 --> 13:58.087
JASON:
I'm gonna get to work.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.089
All right, we got to get the
brass to get us out of here,

14:00.172 --> 14:02.633
'cause Alana's gonna kill
me if I don't get home.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.633
Hayes.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.388
I know you're excited
to get home,

14:07.471 --> 14:09.390
but I need your head here.

14:09.473 --> 14:12.268
Three-foot world.

14:09.473 --> 14:12.268
Yeah. Roger that, Guz.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.686
Teammates look up to you.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.396
They see you doing it right,
they'll do it right.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.607
Yeah, right. What, I
can't think about home?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.276
I'm saying
when we're outside the wire,

14:20.359 --> 14:21.944
home is where you hang
your helmet.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.154
You're no good to me on target

14:24.238 --> 14:26.282
if your mind is back
in Vah Beach.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.122
Someone needs decaf.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.122
(all laughing)

14:33.205 --> 14:35.082
JASON:
He went like this...

14:38.377 --> 14:40.421
Hey!

14:42.381 --> 14:45.009
You were a little hard
on the boys back there, huh?

14:45.092 --> 14:47.970
Try to focus them up.
That's all, Ray.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.597
Come on, Jace.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.807
This is the biggest op
of most of their careers.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.309
I mean, we were

14:53.392 --> 14:56.478
pretty jacked up when we
went after Al-Hazred's daddy.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.068
Move, move, move! Let's go.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.991
Come on, get on. Get on.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.453
Seems like that was the op
that changed everything!

15:12.536 --> 15:14.455
Negative, Ray!

15:14.538 --> 15:16.707
Ops don't change anything!

15:24.590 --> 15:27.426
♪ ♪

15:52.326 --> 15:54.328
JASON: All right.
Cache the vehicles.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.830
We're on foot
the rest of the way.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.881
RAY: Be sure to stay
hydrated, guys.

16:05.964 --> 16:08.384
14,000 feet, altitude
sickness is no joke.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.053
Looks like the Russians passed
through here in the '80s.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.930
Yeah. Now we're here.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.058
Wars exist in this region
for hundreds of years.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.227
JASON:
Transmitting?

16:16.141 --> 16:18.227
Yeah, sending our coordinates.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.395
Havoc,

16:19.478 --> 16:21.563
this is 1.
Transmitting at rally point.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.065
ERIC:
Copy that, Bravo 1.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.859
Be advised, troops in contact.
Romeo has just engaged.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.569
Copy that.
Okay, you heard it, boys.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.571
Romeo's engaged in the fight.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.407
Get our heads
in the game, got it?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.407
SONNY: Looks like

16:31.490 --> 16:32.574
they pulled Willy
Wonka's golden ticket.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.742
THIRTY MIKE:
They found Al-Hazred's camp?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.077
Not yet, Thirty.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.537
You still have time for glory.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.080
That is, if you can make it
up that mountain.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.623
Let's lead out.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.380
ERIC:
Bravo cached the vehicles.

16:46.463 --> 16:47.923
They're now on foot.

16:46.463 --> 16:47.923
DAVIS:
Copy.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.258
All teams
have made their windows,

16:49.341 --> 16:50.592
except there is one issue.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.636
AC-130 wants
to leave station

16:52.720 --> 16:54.096
to refuel.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.096
MAN:
Negative.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.431
Hammer 1
needs to stay on station.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.766
My boys kicked the hornet's nest
on that TIC.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.310
Yeah. Running into the
Tahara patrol was unfortunate.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.104
Cost us the element of surprise.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.898
That contact may draw more
enemy onto my team's position.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.734
With only one bird in the sky,
all the more reason

17:06.817 --> 17:09.945
to keep the AC-130
over my team.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.948
Ensign Davis,

17:13.031 --> 17:15.784
have the AC-130 stay on station
as long as they can.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.162
DAVIS:
Yes, sir.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.812
We're on course.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.190
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.
Be advised,

17:46.273 --> 17:49.234
Hammer 1 is softening
an overwatch position for Romeo,

17:49.318 --> 17:50.861
then pulling off the station.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.571
That's good copy.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.323
Bravo 1 out.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.867
(distant gunshots)

17:56.950 --> 17:58.827
(Cerberus whining)

17:58.911 --> 18:01.455
Your pooch looks skittish.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.455
Ah, he's fine, bro.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.165
JASON:
AC-130

18:03.248 --> 18:05.167
is doing a CAS run for Romeo.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.170
Then they're going off
station to refuel. Got it?

18:08.253 --> 18:09.505
Copy.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.505
No overwatch.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.672
Hanging out in daylight.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.007
What could possibly go wrong?

18:12.090 --> 18:14.343
Hey, Thirty,
bitching is my thing.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.011
Stay in your damn lane.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.180
(panting)

18:18.263 --> 18:20.766
JASON:
Get a sign and go low.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.197
Jackpot.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.788
CLAY:
Looks like we might get first
crack at Al-Hazred after all.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.541
SONNY:
Ain't that a sight?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.501
Looks like jihad Coachella
down there.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.545
More like Allah-Palooza.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.714

a two-hour hike away.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.543
How in the hell
are you even standing?

48:41.627 --> 48:44.338
Havoc, this is 1.
I'm passing yellow tail.

48:56.600 --> 48:59.019
Bravo 6, take the shot.

48:59.102 --> 49:02.064
Romeo 5, take the PKM.

49:02.147 --> 49:04.650
I got the other two.

49:05.942 --> 49:07.527
ROMEO 5:
Copy, Bravo 6.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.655
Locking on target.

49:13.116 --> 49:16.078
Three, two, one.

49:19.414 --> 49:21.375
JASON:
Echo 1, Romeo 1.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.293
This is 1. Light 'em up.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.806
Stand by to move on me.

49:48.485 --> 49:51.405
That technical's gonna slow
Bravo and Romeo's advance.

49:51.488 --> 49:52.906
Squirters moving off target.

49:52.989 --> 49:55.033
DAVIS:
Usually the top
of the food chain

49:55.117 --> 49:56.118
who runs first.

49:56.201 --> 49:57.577
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.204
Eyes on six tangos

49:59.287 --> 50:01.206
pushing towards the mouth
of the cave near your pos.

50:01.289 --> 50:02.457
How copy?

50:02.541 --> 50:04.918
That's good copy, Havoc.

50:05.001 --> 50:06.920
What's the word, boss?

50:05.001 --> 50:06.920
Al-Hazred Jr.'s getting away.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.685
(men shouting in Pashto)

50:35.031 --> 50:36.742
We have to call an audible.

50:36.825 --> 50:38.827
Romeo 1, this is Bravo 1.

50:38.910 --> 50:40.954
You and Echo clear the target,
we'll chase the squirters.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.874
Bravo, move on me. Let's go.

50:50.130 --> 50:52.257
DAVIS:
That cave network
honeycombs two valleys.

50:52.340 --> 50:54.801
Could spit Al-Hazred out
to the east or to the west,

50:54.885 --> 50:56.553
and we won't have
eyes in both areas.

50:56.636 --> 50:59.306
Yeah, then Bravo's gonna have to
move fast if that is Al-Hazred.

50:59.389 --> 51:03.143
Not too fast.
Cave's lined with booby traps.

51:03.226 --> 51:06.062
Wrong move makes
that tunnel their tomb.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.943
The squirters popped
into the cave.

51:12.027 --> 51:14.404
Havoc, this is 1.
Headed to the cave complexes.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.615
Stand by for comms issues.

51:17.616 --> 51:18.825
SONNY:
I wish Cerberus was here

51:18.909 --> 51:20.744
to sniff out some explosives.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.954
Well, you know what? He's got
bigger issues to deal with.

51:23.038 --> 51:24.247
Let's go.

51:29.127 --> 51:31.588
NODs down. Let's roll.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.689
Not him.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.150
No?

52:02.118 --> 52:03.662
SONNY:
Bravo 1, this is 3.

52:03.745 --> 52:05.539
This side's clear.
We hit a dead end.

52:05.622 --> 52:07.499
Copy, 3. Set security.

52:24.474 --> 52:25.809
(speaking Pashto)

52:32.649 --> 52:34.359
It's Al-Hazred.

52:34.442 --> 52:36.319
Need a call, Jace.

52:38.613 --> 52:40.824
Million dollar bullet just
waiting to be shot, Hayes.

52:43.869 --> 52:46.079
We'll take him alive. Cuff him.

52:46.162 --> 52:48.248
CLAY:
Copy that.

52:48.331 --> 52:50.834
♪ ♪

52:54.671 --> 52:56.006
No! No!

53:21.281 --> 53:23.658
Let the record show,
I put the first bullet in him.

53:23.742 --> 53:25.619
Let the record also show
that Ray just saved you

53:25.702 --> 53:27.579
from killing us all
on that pressure plate.

53:31.207 --> 53:33.543
Yeah.

53:39.716 --> 53:43.637
Al-Hazred had every chance
to walk away from this.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.723
He made his choice
to go down hard.

53:50.393 --> 53:52.437
♪ ♪

54:08.703 --> 54:10.830
Welcome back, gentlemen.

54:10.914 --> 54:13.041
Well done.

54:13.124 --> 54:15.377
Word came down
we're headed home Friday.

54:17.253 --> 54:20.548
Leaves you three days to hold
your heads high around here.

54:22.092 --> 54:24.678
You know something, Ray,
you were right.

54:24.761 --> 54:26.805
About what?

54:26.888 --> 54:30.350
You know that op
we had 13 years ago?

54:30.433 --> 54:32.310
Yeah, that...

54:32.394 --> 54:33.979
that did change things for us.

54:34.062 --> 54:36.022
What do you...

54:44.781 --> 54:49.995
(indistinct chatter)

54:50.078 --> 54:54.374
WALKER:
Watched the White Sox win
the series in that tent.

54:54.457 --> 54:56.251
Nothing's sacred.

54:56.334 --> 54:57.711
Whole place will be
scrapped in a month.

54:57.794 --> 55:00.213
You'll be out of business.

54:57.794 --> 55:00.213
I'll be reassigned.

55:00.296 --> 55:03.049
Address will change.
Job never does.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.844
You ever wish you had a job
where at the end of it,

55:05.927 --> 55:08.513
there was a sign that,
I don't know, said that

55:08.596 --> 55:10.724
you were done,
that it was over?

55:10.807 --> 55:12.517
What would that look like?

55:12.600 --> 55:14.227
My Flyers, when they win
the Stanley Cup,

55:14.310 --> 55:15.729
they go down Broad Street
and they have a parade.

55:15.812 --> 55:17.731
It's a victory-- you see it.

55:17.814 --> 55:20.734
Unfortunately for us,
the war on terror

55:20.817 --> 55:23.403
doesn't have
a goal line to cross.

55:23.486 --> 55:24.904
But you know, you don't
strike me as the type

55:24.988 --> 55:27.490
who needs to spike
the football.

55:27.574 --> 55:30.452
Just be nice to know that
it was worth the cost.

55:30.535 --> 55:32.912
40 fallen brothers,
a broken marriage,

55:32.996 --> 55:34.748
broken body...

55:34.831 --> 55:36.791
broken head.

55:34.831 --> 55:36.791
You told me,

55:36.875 --> 55:40.962
last time we spoke,
you know you've made an impact

55:41.046 --> 55:42.756
that will last forever here.

55:42.839 --> 55:44.758
The only thing that's gonna
last forever is this war.

55:44.841 --> 55:47.260
I'll-I'll see you around.

55:47.343 --> 55:49.387
You know, I-I think
you're wrong about them

55:49.471 --> 55:50.930
just scrapping it all.

55:51.014 --> 55:52.432
Somebody's gonna
sort through it.

55:52.515 --> 55:55.935
You know, ask the questions
that we all should ask.

55:56.019 --> 55:58.438
I don't understand
What do you mean?

55:58.521 --> 56:00.940
End of the day...

56:01.024 --> 56:02.734
what do you take away from here?

56:12.410 --> 56:16.414
What can you pull
from the rubble...

56:29.260 --> 56:32.097
...to be cherished?

56:45.443 --> 56:48.363
What do you need
to leave behind?

57:00.583 --> 57:03.461
And what can you pass on
to someone else?

57:03.545 --> 57:06.297
The old man had better taste
in guns than Junior, huh?

57:06.381 --> 57:09.843
Doesn't feel right
leaving a relic like that.

57:09.926 --> 57:12.679
You want to take it?

57:09.926 --> 57:12.679
Not one for trophies.

57:12.762 --> 57:15.682
Especially from that op, but...

57:18.309 --> 57:19.435
Here.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.398
That's for you.

57:25.775 --> 57:27.193
I don't need a trophy, either.

57:27.277 --> 57:28.528
Well, then call
it a reminder.

57:28.611 --> 57:31.531
What you did here,
who you were...

57:31.614 --> 57:33.700
what you meant to this team.

57:33.783 --> 57:35.201
Just following
your lead.

57:35.285 --> 57:37.036
No, you're not.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.247
And maybe that's
a good thing, huh?

57:40.081 --> 57:42.667
Come on, pack it up,
we're rolling out.

57:51.301 --> 57:53.720
(door closes)

58:07.817 --> 58:09.402
You okay?

58:09.485 --> 58:12.238
Yeah, just...

58:12.322 --> 58:14.616
you know...

58:14.699 --> 58:17.076
going over it all in my head.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.078
What I did right.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.581
What I didn't.

58:21.664 --> 58:24.417
Well, I think the rights
win by a landslide.

58:25.835 --> 58:29.255
Longer I stay in, it's the
losses that stick with me.

58:29.339 --> 58:31.090
Then why did you fight
so hard to get

58:31.174 --> 58:33.635
your job back
after they sidelined you?

58:37.513 --> 58:39.974
Uh, maybe I'm a glutton
for punishment.

58:40.058 --> 58:42.060
I'm sorry about Samim.

58:42.143 --> 58:46.105
I should've known
to trust your instincts.

58:46.189 --> 58:48.107
So we're good?

58:48.191 --> 58:50.193
We're good.

58:50.276 --> 58:52.820
I honestly don't know
how I would've made it through

58:52.904 --> 58:55.323
any of this without you.

58:55.406 --> 58:58.618
My instincts tell me
you can handle this job

58:58.701 --> 59:00.411
just fine on your own.

59:00.495 --> 59:01.913
(chuckles)

59:01.996 --> 59:03.498
I'm gonna get a beer.

59:03.581 --> 59:05.541
You want anything?

59:03.581 --> 59:05.541
No, thank you.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.757
SONNY: Just in case
anybody didn't say it...

59:12.840 --> 59:14.634
you know, you, uh,

59:14.717 --> 59:17.303
taking down Al-Hazred Jr.,
you know,

59:17.387 --> 59:18.596
that is your victory.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.014
It was a team effort.

59:20.098 --> 59:21.641
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Mandy told me.

59:21.724 --> 59:24.143
Yeah, you spotted
the bogeyman first,

59:24.227 --> 59:26.980
and then had to drag everybody
kicking and screaming.

59:27.063 --> 59:28.481
Maybe a little bit.

59:28.564 --> 59:30.024
Look at you, man, gone from
second-guessing yourself

59:30.108 --> 59:31.651
chasing a bomb maker

59:31.734 --> 59:34.821
to bagging the biggest whale
in the sea.

59:34.904 --> 59:36.823
And it came at a price.

59:36.906 --> 59:38.449
A price worth paying.

59:38.533 --> 59:39.867
I'll tell you what,
Davis, uh,

59:39.951 --> 59:42.870
I was a real ass
about you wanting to, uh,

59:42.954 --> 59:45.665
you know,
focus on your work and stuff.

59:45.748 --> 59:47.458
You were right.
I was wrong.

59:47.542 --> 59:49.335
Thank you, Sonny.

59:49.419 --> 59:52.380
And, look, uh, I'm not
sure if this still really

59:52.463 --> 59:54.590
means anything or
anything, but, uh...

59:56.259 --> 59:58.261
I'm sure as hell proud of you.

1:00:00.263 --> 1:00:03.850
All right, listen up, everyone.

1:00:03.933 --> 1:00:06.853
We're losing Ray
for two months while he's off

1:00:06.936 --> 1:00:09.355
at the Chief Warrant
Officer Academy.

1:00:09.439 --> 1:00:11.524
Oh, look at that!

1:00:11.607 --> 1:00:13.151
They approved my package?

1:00:13.234 --> 1:00:14.736
You're in.

1:00:13.234 --> 1:00:14.736
Ah, look at that, here you go.

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:17.739
Chief Warrant Officer Perry.

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:17.739
Hey, buddy. Oh, man.

1:00:17.822 --> 1:00:19.532
JASON:
He's looking good.

1:00:19.615 --> 1:00:20.992
Look at that.

1:00:19.615 --> 1:00:20.992
Almost slipped away
a couple times.

1:00:21.075 --> 1:00:22.327
Never in doubt.

1:00:22.410 --> 1:00:25.496
You told me you'd get me home
and you did.

1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:28.207
Them stripes gonna look
good on you, Ray. (whooping)

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:30.668
What are you doing?

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:30.668
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:00:30.752 --> 1:00:33.546
Timeout, timeout-- who is, who
is this kinder, gentler Sonny

1:00:33.629 --> 1:00:36.841
and where'd the guy go
who was throwing cake at me?

1:00:36.924 --> 1:00:38.676
(sighs) Slow your roll there,
Blond Ambition.

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:41.179
Truth is I had
some wrong-headed ideas

1:00:41.262 --> 1:00:43.431
about what the brotherhood was.

1:00:43.514 --> 1:00:45.725
Turns out that fighting together
makes us brothers,

1:00:45.808 --> 1:00:49.395
but it doesn't keep us
together as brothers.

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:52.398
That bond does,
no matter where we go

1:00:52.482 --> 1:00:54.901
or what we do.

1:00:54.984 --> 1:00:57.612
Amen to that.

1:00:54.984 --> 1:00:57.612
That's it.
Amen to that, cheers.

1:00:57.695 --> 1:01:01.074
And it's a damn good
thing, too, 'cause, uh,

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:03.826
you know, with you making
warrant officer and with

1:01:03.910 --> 1:01:05.912
Clay heading to STA-21,

1:01:05.995 --> 1:01:09.207
this deployment was the
last stand of the Bravo Team.

1:01:09.290 --> 1:01:11.084
Yeah.

1:01:11.167 --> 1:01:12.752
Love you guys.

1:01:12.835 --> 1:01:13.878
JASON: Love you back. Brothers.

1:01:12.835 --> 1:01:13.878
RAY: Cheers.

1:01:18.674 --> 1:01:20.051
Whoa, you're gonna have
to get used to packing

1:01:20.134 --> 1:01:22.178
where you're going, there,
Justin Bieber.

1:01:22.261 --> 1:01:24.722
Or not-- gonna need
a whole new wardrobe.

1:01:24.806 --> 1:01:26.891
SONNY:
Maybe you and Ray can
get a discount

1:01:26.974 --> 1:01:29.477
code on a fruit salad.
(laughs)

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.813
Sonny, I hope you get some
new material by the time

1:01:31.896 --> 1:01:34.273
I get back from
Chief Warrant Officer Academy.

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:36.734
I got dibs on Clay's IR laser.

1:01:36.818 --> 1:01:38.820
This battle belt's mine.

1:01:38.903 --> 1:01:40.488
Have at it.

1:01:40.571 --> 1:01:41.572
SONNY:
Hey, Jace?

1:01:40.571 --> 1:01:41.572
Yeah?

1:01:41.656 --> 1:01:42.824
I'm thinking the Ozarks

1:01:42.907 --> 1:01:45.243
for this, uh,
training trip cycle.

1:01:45.326 --> 1:01:47.078
Arkansas Alps,
they'd do us right.

1:01:47.161 --> 1:01:49.914
Yeah, that's some next-level
thinking there, Sonny.

1:01:49.997 --> 1:01:51.749
SONNY: Uh, you know,
I'm just, uh,

1:01:51.833 --> 1:01:53.418
I'm just trying to step up with,
you know, Ray

1:01:53.501 --> 1:01:55.086
not gonna be around as much and

1:01:55.169 --> 1:01:58.131
ol' peaches over there
is gonna be gone.

1:01:58.214 --> 1:02:00.091
Sonny Quinn
in a leadership position.

1:02:00.174 --> 1:02:01.926
What could possibly go wrong?

1:02:02.009 --> 1:02:04.303
Clay, uh, you might have
to stick around to see that.

1:02:04.387 --> 1:02:06.097
Might not be much to see.

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:07.473
Listen, I was just
talking to Blackburn

1:02:07.557 --> 1:02:08.599
and he was telling me

1:02:08.683 --> 1:02:10.143
that NCIS is on a witch hunt

1:02:10.226 --> 1:02:11.936
to find out
who wrote that letter

1:02:12.019 --> 1:02:14.605
to Ambassador Marsden's husband.

1:02:12.019 --> 1:02:14.605
What?

1:02:14.689 --> 1:02:16.816
They're coming after us
for... for a mistake

1:02:16.899 --> 1:02:18.985
the State Department made?

1:02:16.899 --> 1:02:18.985
DoD needs a scalp.

1:02:19.068 --> 1:02:20.653
They're convinced
that the letter came

1:02:20.736 --> 1:02:22.447
from someone inside

1:02:22.530 --> 1:02:24.157
this team.

1:02:22.530 --> 1:02:24.157
Come on, we haven't
even been back

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:25.992
for five minutes and
we're already under attack?

1:02:26.075 --> 1:02:26.993
Egg on the state's face

1:02:27.076 --> 1:02:28.161
isn't worth dinging
one of our careers over.

1:02:28.244 --> 1:02:31.164
Far as I'm concerned,
nobody here wrote that letter.

1:02:31.247 --> 1:02:32.999
Easiest way to keep it straight

1:02:33.082 --> 1:02:34.375
when they start
asking us questions. Got it?

1:02:36.043 --> 1:02:38.004
Let's go.

1:02:58.274 --> 1:02:59.901
Daddy!

1:02:59.984 --> 1:03:02.320
Hey, baby girl!

1:03:02.403 --> 1:03:04.071
Daddy missed you so much.

1:03:04.155 --> 1:03:05.531
I missed you, too.

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:06.991
I can't wait to show you
my canopy bed upstairs.

1:03:07.074 --> 1:03:09.202
Yeah?

1:03:07.074 --> 1:03:09.202
Give him a second to catch
his breath, honey.

1:03:09.285 --> 1:03:12.079
Now how you gonna say that
and then take my breath away?

1:03:14.790 --> 1:03:16.792
Hey, you know who else
missed you?

1:03:18.336 --> 1:03:19.879
(exhales)

1:03:19.962 --> 1:03:21.047
Teena!

1:03:19.962 --> 1:03:21.047
Yeah.

1:03:21.130 --> 1:03:22.381
Did she do a good job?

1:03:22.465 --> 1:03:24.008
Oh, she did a great job,
sweetheart.

1:03:24.091 --> 1:03:26.385
Worst thing I got was
this tiny little scratch.

1:03:26.469 --> 1:03:27.678
Did it hurt?

1:03:27.762 --> 1:03:29.931
Nothing Daddy
couldn't handle.

1:03:33.643 --> 1:03:34.894
Go play.

1:03:36.896 --> 1:03:38.189
You sure showing her a scar

1:03:38.272 --> 1:03:40.608
is the best thing
for her anxiety?

1:03:40.691 --> 1:03:44.070
I'm not hiding the truth
from my family ever again.

1:03:44.153 --> 1:03:46.739
I've seen what happens
to team guys that do that.

1:03:46.822 --> 1:03:49.283
Fair enough. I'm just
glad you're home.

1:03:49.367 --> 1:03:50.618
Hmm.

1:03:51.661 --> 1:03:54.288
I damn near got lost
trying to find the place.

1:03:51.661 --> 1:03:54.288
(chuckles)

1:03:54.372 --> 1:03:56.040
Can't wait to see
what you did inside.

1:03:56.123 --> 1:03:57.542
Okay, pump the brakes
on those expectations.

1:03:57.625 --> 1:04:00.211
I did leave a few projects
for you, so...

1:04:00.294 --> 1:04:03.381
It's too bad they got
to wait a little longer.

1:04:03.464 --> 1:04:05.216
At least till after
Chief Warrant Officer Academy.

1:04:05.299 --> 1:04:06.551
You're in?

1:04:06.634 --> 1:04:08.886
Hope so.

1:04:06.634 --> 1:04:08.886
What do you mean, "hope so"?

1:04:08.970 --> 1:04:11.722
Command's on Bravo's ass
over some nonsense.

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:13.558
It could jeopardize
my promotion if it blows up.

1:04:13.641 --> 1:04:16.727
Then let's hope it blows over.

1:04:16.811 --> 1:04:21.732
But for now, how about we enjoy
your first day in your new home?

1:04:21.816 --> 1:04:24.569
Roger that, Mrs. Perry.

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:27.613
All right, let's go.

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:27.613
Yes. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1:04:27.697 --> 1:04:29.615
Come on, girl.

1:04:27.697 --> 1:04:29.615
Come on.

1:04:34.704 --> 1:04:37.415
Oh, that's right.
We were gonna split these.

1:04:37.498 --> 1:04:41.252
Tres tacos for you,
and this burrito for me.

1:04:41.335 --> 1:04:43.838
Same order as our
last homecoming meal.

1:04:45.214 --> 1:04:46.757
It's called the usual
for a reason, Mandy.

1:04:46.841 --> 1:04:47.967
Right.

1:04:48.050 --> 1:04:49.635
Old habits,

1:04:49.719 --> 1:04:51.262
falling back into
the routines.

1:04:51.345 --> 1:04:53.639
Hey, it's-- it is called
the reentry process.

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:55.600
That's what it is.
We're reentering.

1:04:55.683 --> 1:04:56.976
That's what I'm doing, all
right? Part of that process...

1:04:57.059 --> 1:04:58.936
Reentry went pretty
well for you last time,

1:04:59.020 --> 1:05:00.479
alone in that garage apartment,

1:05:00.563 --> 1:05:03.107
just the sound of your microwave
to keep you company.

1:05:03.190 --> 1:05:05.318
Can I just enjoy
my burrito, please?

1:05:05.401 --> 1:05:06.694
Thank you.

1:05:10.031 --> 1:05:12.783
So, what time should I expect
you to knock on my door tonight

1:05:12.867 --> 1:05:15.036
when whatever spooked you
in Afghanistan

1:05:15.119 --> 1:05:17.663
comes creeping
back up on you?

1:05:15.119 --> 1:05:17.663
Stop, all right?

1:05:17.747 --> 1:05:19.206
I thought you said what happens
in J-Bad stays in J-Bad.

1:05:19.290 --> 1:05:20.458
Didn't we agree to that?

1:05:20.541 --> 1:05:21.667
We did. We agreed.

1:05:20.541 --> 1:05:21.667
Mm-hmm.

1:05:21.751 --> 1:05:25.421
It was a needed distraction,

1:05:25.504 --> 1:05:27.840
and a temporary solve

1:05:27.923 --> 1:05:29.967
for bigger issues.

1:05:27.923 --> 1:05:29.967
I get it.

1:05:30.051 --> 1:05:31.344
I know what you're doing here.

1:05:31.427 --> 1:05:32.720
I understand
the whole therapy thing.

1:05:32.803 --> 1:05:34.347
This is what you call
"transference," right?

1:05:34.430 --> 1:05:36.390
These are your demons
that are coming out,

1:05:36.474 --> 1:05:37.850
that you're dealing with,

1:05:37.933 --> 1:05:40.186
after seeing Samim's widow,
not my demons.

1:05:40.269 --> 1:05:41.437
Your demons.

1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:44.357
"Hardest part is living
with the fact

1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:46.984
that this is who
I chose to become," yes.

1:05:47.068 --> 1:05:48.527
Mm-hmm.

1:05:47.068 --> 1:05:48.527
You're right,

1:05:48.611 --> 1:05:51.280
I am still thinking about it.

1:05:51.364 --> 1:05:54.492
Samim, Jack Daniels,
Al-Hazred Jr.

1:05:54.575 --> 1:05:57.078
They're gone.
They're in the past.

1:05:57.161 --> 1:05:58.704
We move forward.
That's what we do.

1:05:58.788 --> 1:05:59.830
Ignore and override.

1:05:58.788 --> 1:05:59.830
Exactly.

1:05:59.914 --> 1:06:01.248
Ignore and override.

1:06:01.332 --> 1:06:04.669
We made a choice,
now we live with it.

1:06:04.752 --> 1:06:06.504
Maybe.

1:06:06.587 --> 1:06:08.589
What do you mean, maybe?

1:06:08.673 --> 1:06:11.342
Maybe we can choose
to become someone else again.

1:06:11.425 --> 1:06:12.843
You Tinker Bell now?

1:06:12.927 --> 1:06:14.553
Fantasy world?
Is that what we're doing?

1:06:14.637 --> 1:06:17.139
I always wanted to play third
base for the Phillies, but...

1:06:17.223 --> 1:06:18.683
I'm serious.

1:06:17.223 --> 1:06:18.683
So am I.

1:06:18.766 --> 1:06:20.685
We made a commitment
to serve.

1:06:20.768 --> 1:06:22.687
(grunts softly)

1:06:20.768 --> 1:06:22.687
Right?

1:06:23.771 --> 1:06:25.690
But until when?

1:06:27.483 --> 1:06:30.695
All in all the time, it doesn't
leave any room for us.

1:06:30.778 --> 1:06:31.612
Yeah, right, what are you
gonna do? You gonna sit at home

1:06:31.696 --> 1:06:33.364
on the couch
and play Mortal Kombat?

1:06:33.447 --> 1:06:34.699
That's not what we do.

1:06:34.782 --> 1:06:36.867
We just cut the head
off a snake.

1:06:36.951 --> 1:06:39.412
Tomorrow, another snake
is gonna slither out...

1:06:36.951 --> 1:06:39.412
Mm-hmm.

1:06:39.495 --> 1:06:42.748
...from some other rock,
and on and on.

1:06:42.832 --> 1:06:44.291
And on and on and on.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:46.544
You're gonna find them,
I'm gonna kill them.

1:06:46.627 --> 1:06:49.797
Besides, if we don't do it,
who's gonna do it, Mandy?

1:06:50.798 --> 1:06:51.924
Someone else.

1:06:52.007 --> 1:06:53.926
(laughs):
Someone else.

1:06:54.009 --> 1:06:55.720
You've been in this way too long

1:06:55.803 --> 1:06:57.596
to believe that you're
comfortable with that answer.

1:06:57.680 --> 1:06:59.932
You're right.

1:06:57.680 --> 1:06:59.932
Yeah.

1:07:00.015 --> 1:07:01.809
But I was a teenager
when I got in.

1:07:01.892 --> 1:07:04.395
We'd just been hit.

1:07:04.478 --> 1:07:09.066
The path ahead seemed
so clear and so right.

1:07:09.150 --> 1:07:11.777
And 20 years later--

1:07:11.861 --> 1:07:14.238
20 years--

1:07:14.321 --> 1:07:17.408
all the loss, all the bloodshed.

1:07:17.491 --> 1:07:19.702
I mean, Samim, Dr. Craig.

1:07:26.041 --> 1:07:28.127
I can't do this anymore.

1:07:26.041 --> 1:07:28.127
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:07:28.210 --> 1:07:31.088
What do you mean,
you can't do this anymore?

1:07:31.172 --> 1:07:32.923
It's who you are.
It's who we are.

1:07:33.007 --> 1:07:34.133
It's not who I want to be.

1:07:34.216 --> 1:07:36.427
(sniffles) It's not.

1:07:34.216 --> 1:07:36.427
Okay, who do you want
to be, Mandy?

1:07:36.510 --> 1:07:38.471
I don't know.

1:07:36.510 --> 1:07:38.471
You don't know?

1:07:39.555 --> 1:07:40.806
I have to
do this now.

1:07:40.890 --> 1:07:42.224
What do you mean,
you have to do this now?

1:07:42.308 --> 1:07:43.601
I have to do this now.

1:07:42.308 --> 1:07:43.601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

1:07:43.684 --> 1:07:45.478
You haven't even eaten
your tacos.

1:07:45.561 --> 1:07:46.729
You haven't
touched them.

1:07:46.812 --> 1:07:48.230
This is the best burrito
in Vah Beach.

1:07:48.314 --> 1:07:51.317
If I don't walk away now,
I'm gonna lose myself forever.

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:54.361
Just...

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:54.361
And if I stay, you're
gonna talk me out of it.

1:07:54.445 --> 1:07:56.197
Mandy look, just sit down,
eat your burrito.

1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:57.531
Have-have this.

1:07:59.033 --> 1:08:00.618
Come on.

1:07:59.033 --> 1:08:00.618
Jason.

1:08:02.244 --> 1:08:04.288
I'll see you around.

1:08:21.639 --> 1:08:23.682
(indistinct chatter)

1:08:28.395 --> 1:08:29.688
(exhales)

1:08:29.772 --> 1:08:32.107
You asked to see me,
Petty Officer?

1:08:34.944 --> 1:08:36.987
Yes, sir.

1:08:41.617 --> 1:08:43.536
I wanted to ask you about
the investigation

1:08:43.619 --> 1:08:46.163
into the letter
to Ambassador Marsden's husband.

1:08:46.247 --> 1:08:48.332
Okay. What about it?

1:08:48.415 --> 1:08:50.543
Well, I was hoping
you could explain

1:08:50.626 --> 1:08:52.837
the high-level thinking to me.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:55.005
You know, why the DoD's
so concerned about it.

1:08:55.089 --> 1:08:58.384
You don't think the concern
is warranted?

1:08:58.467 --> 1:09:02.054
I think it's a waste of
the Navy's time and resources.

1:09:02.137 --> 1:09:04.014
Well, not when someone
under my command

1:09:04.098 --> 1:09:05.850
accused the State Department
of lying

1:09:05.933 --> 1:09:08.435
on the front page
of The Washington Post.

1:09:09.395 --> 1:09:11.522
The letter was sent
to a private citizen,

1:09:11.605 --> 1:09:14.733
and no intel or tactics
were revealed.

1:09:14.817 --> 1:09:16.193
Not to mention
the State Department

1:09:16.277 --> 1:09:17.695
was lying about the ambassador.

1:09:17.778 --> 1:09:19.405
You know that doesn't matter.

1:09:19.488 --> 1:09:21.115
I mean, whoever
wrote the letter

1:09:21.198 --> 1:09:23.617
put his future with the Navy
in serious jeopardy.

1:09:26.495 --> 1:09:28.414
Couldn't stand
the thought of her kids

1:09:28.497 --> 1:09:31.250
thinking that their mother
was anything but a hero.

1:09:44.305 --> 1:09:46.307
(door closes)

1:09:52.855 --> 1:09:54.690
You wrote the letter?

1:09:56.692 --> 1:09:58.152
I did.

1:10:01.655 --> 1:10:04.491
I didn't think that the family
would take it to the media.

1:10:06.869 --> 1:10:08.913
Seems you have more in
common with the cowboys

1:10:08.996 --> 1:10:11.040
on Bravo Team than I thought.

1:10:13.042 --> 1:10:16.128
I will talk to NCIS.

1:10:16.211 --> 1:10:20.257
I would prefer to handle this
internally, for both our sakes.

1:10:20.341 --> 1:10:22.426
Thank you.

1:10:22.509 --> 1:10:24.595
If you expected no more
than a slap on the wrist

1:10:24.678 --> 1:10:27.222
for this, you're wrong.

1:10:28.349 --> 1:10:31.518
Goes without saying,
STA-21 is gone.

1:10:34.355 --> 1:10:36.357
I understand, sir.

1:10:48.118 --> 1:10:50.120
(insects chirping)

1:11:05.928 --> 1:11:07.972
(insects chirping)

1:11:24.947 --> 1:11:26.949
(bags thud)

1:11:34.790 --> 1:11:37.251
(exhales)

1:11:57.604 --> 1:11:59.648
(whirring softly)

1:12:09.033 --> 1:12:10.951
Somebody want to tell me?

1:12:11.035 --> 1:12:11.910
Since after deployment,

1:12:11.994 --> 1:12:13.912
aren't we supposed
to get two weeks off?

1:12:13.996 --> 1:12:15.080
JASON:
All right, look, that letter
was published months ago.

1:12:15.164 --> 1:12:18.625
Why is NCIS pressing the gas
on this investigation, huh?

1:12:18.709 --> 1:12:20.961
No one needs to talk to NCIS.

1:12:21.045 --> 1:12:22.921
The offender has
come forward.

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:24.423
Wait, what?

1:12:27.509 --> 1:12:29.595
Who?

1:12:29.678 --> 1:12:31.513
I wrote the letter.

1:12:37.394 --> 1:12:39.438
They gonna bring
the hammer down?

1:12:40.898 --> 1:12:42.775
Still working out
all the details, but, you know,

1:12:42.858 --> 1:12:44.276
probably wind up
with some crap assignment

1:12:44.359 --> 1:12:46.612
in addition to docked pay
and busted rank.

1:12:46.695 --> 1:12:48.238
And STA-21?

1:12:48.322 --> 1:12:50.282
It's off the table.

1:12:57.664 --> 1:13:00.417
I got to go see Lindell
right now for the final verdict.

1:13:02.294 --> 1:13:04.004
Anyone got a spoonful of sugar

1:13:04.088 --> 1:13:07.883
to help the blond Icarus's
medicine go down?

1:13:12.137 --> 1:13:14.014
Hey. Hey.

1:13:15.432 --> 1:13:18.352
What the hell were you thinking?

1:13:18.435 --> 1:13:20.687
Truth needed to come out.

1:13:20.771 --> 1:13:22.815
What truth is that, Clay?

1:13:22.898 --> 1:13:24.817
You didn't write the letter.

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.652
I wrote the letter.

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.652
I figured you did all along.

1:13:26.735 --> 1:13:29.822
Come on, man. Who else on Bravo
would be so selfless?

1:13:29.905 --> 1:13:31.657
No, it was more like reckless.

1:13:31.740 --> 1:13:33.367
Now I got you caught up
in my mess.

1:13:33.450 --> 1:13:34.827
But the world
now knows

1:13:34.910 --> 1:13:37.329
who Marsden was,
and that's what matters.

1:13:37.412 --> 1:13:38.539
You did the right thing.

1:13:38.622 --> 1:13:39.665
And you are doing the wrong

1:13:39.748 --> 1:13:41.667
by trying to take
the rap for me.

1:13:41.750 --> 1:13:43.502
I can't unring the bell, Ray.

1:13:43.585 --> 1:13:45.921
What about your future, huh?

1:13:47.131 --> 1:13:49.174
I like where I am.

1:13:49.258 --> 1:13:50.717
You like where you're going.

1:13:50.801 --> 1:13:52.010
It's a win-win.

1:13:52.094 --> 1:13:53.178
That's real noble of you, Clay.

1:13:53.262 --> 1:13:55.180
It is, but I can't
let you do it.

1:13:55.264 --> 1:13:57.516
You want to go tell Lindell
that it was you?

1:13:57.599 --> 1:13:58.475
Because then I get busted
for lying

1:13:58.559 --> 1:14:01.687
and you can
kiss warrant officer goodbye.

1:14:02.771 --> 1:14:04.648
Why the hell couldn't you just
let this investigation

1:14:04.731 --> 1:14:07.151
flame out?

1:14:07.234 --> 1:14:09.736
Because someone was gonna
have to take the hit

1:14:09.820 --> 1:14:11.363
and it didn't need to be you.

1:14:11.447 --> 1:14:13.740
A-a guy who's paid his dues
to get where he is,

1:14:13.824 --> 1:14:16.577
has a family to look out for,
a brand-new house.

1:14:23.417 --> 1:14:25.711
I'm not sure I can
ever repay you.

1:14:25.794 --> 1:14:28.589
You already have.

1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:32.092
Come on, you're the
reason I made Bravo.

1:14:41.977 --> 1:14:44.396
(lock beeps, latch clicks)

1:14:44.479 --> 1:14:46.523
BROCK: Look who's back!

1:14:44.479 --> 1:14:46.523
(barking)

1:14:46.607 --> 1:14:48.609
Oh, yeah.

1:14:46.607 --> 1:14:48.609
It's gonna take a few months

1:14:48.692 --> 1:14:50.068
to get him back
into fighting shape,

1:14:50.152 --> 1:14:53.614
but Cerberus is cleared
for duty.

1:14:53.697 --> 1:14:55.240
TRENT:
Injury wasn't
the problem.

1:14:55.324 --> 1:14:57.075
He spooked on that mountain.

1:14:57.159 --> 1:14:59.578
And on target in J-Bad
before that.

1:14:59.661 --> 1:15:02.080
Oh, is that why you were, uh,

1:15:02.164 --> 1:15:03.415
running all those drills
with him?

1:15:03.498 --> 1:15:05.417
Yeah. The time off
will be good for him.

1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:07.920
Brock.

1:15:08.003 --> 1:15:11.089
His three years in
is like 21 for any of us.

1:15:11.173 --> 1:15:13.133
It's a lot to handle,
especially for a creature

1:15:13.217 --> 1:15:15.761
that can't ask for help
with his PTS.

1:15:15.844 --> 1:15:18.138
It's on us
to recognize the signs.

1:15:18.222 --> 1:15:19.514
JASON:
A warrior's place is
on the battlefield.

1:15:19.598 --> 1:15:23.268
That dog was bred
to be in the fight.

1:15:23.352 --> 1:15:27.105
But I think he's suffered
way too much stress,

1:15:27.189 --> 1:15:28.732
combat and trauma.

1:15:28.815 --> 1:15:31.109
I think it's time for him
to just be a dog.

1:15:31.193 --> 1:15:33.445
This is officially
the worst day off ever.

1:15:33.528 --> 1:15:36.615
Okay, please tell me y'all
are gonna meet for drinks later.

1:15:36.698 --> 1:15:38.617
Yeah. Of course.

1:15:38.700 --> 1:15:41.078
We got to give Ray Perry
a proper send-off

1:15:41.161 --> 1:15:43.163
to CWO Academy.

1:15:44.539 --> 1:15:46.541
(panting)

1:15:51.713 --> 1:15:53.715
(knock on door)

1:16:01.765 --> 1:16:04.309
(laughs softly)

1:16:01.765 --> 1:16:04.309
CLAY: Mmm.

1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:08.522
Hmm. Guess you missed me.

1:16:10.565 --> 1:16:13.151
You tacking on a couple
extra days at the end

1:16:13.235 --> 1:16:14.820
was textbook psyops.

1:16:14.903 --> 1:16:17.531
I'm glad to know it worked.

1:16:17.614 --> 1:16:20.325
I might have to
adjust my visitation

1:16:20.409 --> 1:16:23.287
schedule when you're
in Newport for STA-21.

1:16:26.707 --> 1:16:30.335
Actually, that
won't be an issue.

1:16:30.419 --> 1:16:32.462
Why's that?

1:16:35.590 --> 1:16:39.136
You're not going, are you?

1:16:39.219 --> 1:16:41.888
Command needed a fall guy
for the Marsden letter.

1:16:41.972 --> 1:16:44.516
You're not naive enough
to have written it.

1:16:44.599 --> 1:16:47.352
You're paying for
someone else's crime. Why?

1:16:49.271 --> 1:16:51.315
Because Lindell will
take it easy on me.

1:16:51.398 --> 1:16:53.108
Cover his own ass

1:16:53.191 --> 1:16:55.360
after pumping me up as being
the future of the Navy.

1:16:55.444 --> 1:16:59.031
Did the team put you up to this?

1:16:59.114 --> 1:17:00.657
No.

1:17:00.741 --> 1:17:03.869
So you voluntarily
threw away your future.

1:17:03.952 --> 1:17:05.370
I protected my brothers.

1:17:05.454 --> 1:17:07.539
More like hit the
self-destruct button.

1:17:07.622 --> 1:17:08.874
After three months
on deployment,

1:17:08.957 --> 1:17:10.083
you changed your mind,

1:17:10.167 --> 1:17:12.377
and this is a way to bail on
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

1:17:12.461 --> 1:17:14.171
without actually bailing.

1:17:14.254 --> 1:17:16.882
What I did over there mattered.

1:17:14.254 --> 1:17:16.882
Do you think

1:17:16.965 --> 1:17:20.218
that it was a mistake to say yes
to STA-21 in the first place?

1:17:20.302 --> 1:17:23.388
(exhales) I think I was
confused about how I fit in

1:17:23.472 --> 1:17:25.223
with the team.

1:17:25.307 --> 1:17:28.393
And I think I made
a few wrong turns along the way.

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:31.855
Am I one of those wrong turns?

1:17:37.110 --> 1:17:39.654
You call me
when you figure it out.

1:17:42.491 --> 1:17:43.784
(door slams)

1:17:47.329 --> 1:17:48.413
(pounds table)

1:17:48.497 --> 1:17:50.540
(country music playing)

1:17:54.503 --> 1:17:56.421
Hey.

1:17:56.505 --> 1:17:58.131
You know, it is
a damn shame

1:17:58.215 --> 1:17:59.674
it takes Ray Perry
to disappear on us

1:17:59.758 --> 1:18:01.093
for you to come hang.

1:18:01.176 --> 1:18:03.136
(laughs)

1:18:01.176 --> 1:18:03.136
Huh? (laughs)

1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:04.846
Glad you're here, though.

1:18:04.930 --> 1:18:07.974
Good to see you.

1:18:04.930 --> 1:18:07.974
Good to see you, too.

1:18:08.058 --> 1:18:09.768
You know, I don't
know how much of

1:18:09.851 --> 1:18:11.103
a regular thing
this is gonna be,

1:18:11.186 --> 1:18:13.271
but I miss hanging
with the team.

1:18:13.355 --> 1:18:14.815
Yeah. You know,
here I am thinking that

1:18:14.898 --> 1:18:18.944
Agent Cody Banks has turned you
off door kickers, too.

1:18:19.027 --> 1:18:20.779
Think you're overestimating
his role in my life.

1:18:20.862 --> 1:18:22.781
No.

1:18:20.862 --> 1:18:22.781
Yes.

1:18:22.864 --> 1:18:24.282
You two are done-zo?

1:18:22.864 --> 1:18:24.282
See ya later.

1:18:24.366 --> 1:18:28.537
Wow. Well, uh, you know,
he was, uh, he was a...

1:18:28.620 --> 1:18:31.540
he... (chuckles)
he was, he was a nice guy.

1:18:31.623 --> 1:18:34.292
(laughs)

1:18:31.623 --> 1:18:34.292
He is a nice guy, thank you.

1:18:34.376 --> 1:18:37.754
He just wasn't worth the effort
of long distance.

1:18:39.548 --> 1:18:42.634
Hey, you know, we never got
to do a postmortem on Texas.

1:18:42.717 --> 1:18:44.344
Yeah.

1:18:42.717 --> 1:18:44.344
Obviously, you survived.

1:18:44.428 --> 1:18:46.138
Ah, yeah.
I, uh...

1:18:46.221 --> 1:18:47.806
I better than survived.

1:18:47.889 --> 1:18:51.476
You know, I got to
patch things up with my pops.

1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:54.187
Good for you.

1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:54.187
Yeah, it feels good.

1:18:54.271 --> 1:18:56.648
You know, something
I learned with my sister:

1:18:56.731 --> 1:19:00.277
um, if a relationship
is important,

1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:02.446

1:19:51.453 --> 1:19:55.040
A celebration, actually.

1:19:55.123 --> 1:19:58.168
A paper I wrote got published.
Lindell put me up

1:19:58.251 --> 1:20:02.422

I don't care
about the award.

Lindell, he wasn't right

but he was definitely
spot-on about you.

RAY:
Can't believe I got less
than a week with my family

1:20:34.829 --> 1:20:36.998
before I got to
disappear again.

1:20:37.082 --> 1:20:39.084
Well, look, Ray. I
mean, put it this way.

1:20:39.167 --> 1:20:40.919
At least, you know, your
daughter doesn't have to worry

1:20:41.002 --> 1:20:42.462
you're gonna get killed
in Rhode Island, right?

1:20:42.546 --> 1:20:44.798
(chuckles)
True.

1:20:44.881 --> 1:20:48.343
Still got questions, though.
You try explaining

1:20:48.426 --> 1:20:50.262
what a warrant officer is
to an eight-year-old.

1:20:50.345 --> 1:20:52.931
Have to explain it to me first.

1:20:53.014 --> 1:20:55.517
Heard about Mandy.

Yeah, we'll see.

I should buy you one.

1:21:28.717 --> 1:21:31.469
Me?
(chuckles)

1:21:31.553 --> 1:21:33.305
Wait a second.
You want to buy me one?

1:21:31.553 --> 1:21:33.305
Buy you a round.

1:21:33.388 --> 1:21:35.223
Why's that?

1:21:35.307 --> 1:21:36.975

1:21:50.739 --> 1:21:52.365
thought he was untouchable.

1:21:52.449 --> 1:21:55.493
Look, Jason.

1:21:55.577 --> 1:21:57.454
Do me a favor.

1:21:57.537 --> 1:21:59.497
Don't-don't ride him about that
while I'm gone, will you?

1:21:59.581 --> 1:22:01.249
Why not?

1:22:04.127 --> 1:22:06.296
Something you're not telling me,
Ray?

1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:10.050
He didn't write it.

1:22:10.133 --> 1:22:12.135
He's covering for me.

1:22:13.762 --> 1:22:15.013
You wrote it?

1:22:15.096 --> 1:22:16.681
I'm sorry.

1:22:16.765 --> 1:22:18.850
You told him, and he offered?

1:22:16.765 --> 1:22:18.850
I didn't tell him anything.

1:22:18.933 --> 1:22:20.727
He just took it on himself.

1:22:20.810 --> 1:22:23.021
Huh.

knowing you can actually count
on those guys.

1:22:40.455 --> 1:22:41.748

will you?

("Can't You See" by The
Marshall Tucker Band playing)

1:22:47.796 --> 1:22:51.049
Sending Ray off here has
got me thinking about, uh,

1:22:51.132 --> 1:22:54.427
about Bravo Team's past
and-and its future.

1:22:54.511 --> 1:22:57.555
You know, Guzo.

1:22:57.639 --> 1:22:59.516
(chuckles)

1:22:59.599 --> 1:23:01.559
My first team leader.

1:23:01.643 --> 1:23:05.397
He taught me what it meant
to be all in all the time.

1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:08.191
And that's a steep price.

1:23:08.274 --> 1:23:11.736
A steep price
and it's not for everyone.

1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:14.364
I'm a better warrior
than I ever was a husband

1:23:14.447 --> 1:23:16.408
or a father.

1:23:16.491 --> 1:23:18.410
But that, see,
that was the choice I made.

1:23:18.493 --> 1:23:20.412
The choice I made
was-was to win the fight

1:23:20.495 --> 1:23:21.579
and bring my brothers home.

1:23:21.663 --> 1:23:23.498
My men and my mission
came first.

1:23:24.499 --> 1:23:25.917
But we just took out

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.752
the son of a man
that I killed

1:23:27.836 --> 1:23:29.754
13 years ago, and it seems to me

1:23:29.838 --> 1:23:32.674
like this mission
isn't ending anytime soon.

1:23:33.675 --> 1:23:35.593
And from this last deployment,

1:23:35.677 --> 1:23:37.721
it just showed me that...

1:23:37.804 --> 1:23:40.765
