00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

01:09.995 --> 01:12.462
YEAH, YEAH,
THAT'S IT. NOW KEEP IT UP.

01:15.132 --> 01:17.131
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

01:19.201 --> 01:22.335
THAT'S OK.
YOU ALSO LOOK LIKE ONE.

01:22.402 --> 01:24.169
NOW, ONTO YOUR BACKS.

01:24.237 --> 01:26.870
WHOA!
OH, THAT HURTS.

01:26.937 --> 01:30.239
REMEMBER, MICHELANGELO,
NO PAIN, NO GAIN.

01:30.307 --> 01:33.741
NOW SPIN, SPIN
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

01:44.549 --> 01:46.348
WHEN I HAND
THIS TAPE TO APRIL,

01:46.416 --> 01:48.750
WE'LL HAVE A BEST-SELLING
EXERCISE CASSETTE--

01:50.284 --> 01:51.550
OH, SPEAKING OF APRIL,

01:51.618 --> 01:53.552
IT'S TIME TO CATCH HER
ON THE NEWS.

01:53.620 --> 01:54.653
ALL RIGHT!

01:54.720 --> 01:57.855
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS--
PIZZA TIME!

01:57.923 --> 02:01.556
THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL
DEEP BENEATH THE CITY,

02:01.625 --> 02:03.091
WHERE URBAN ARCHAEOLOGISTS

02:03.158 --> 02:04.825
HAVE MADE
AN AMAZING DISCOVERY--

02:04.960 --> 02:07.326
AN ANCIENT TEMPLE
OF AN UNKNOWN CULTURE,

02:07.394 --> 02:09.594
BURIED FOR MILLIONS
OF YEARS.

02:09.662 --> 02:11.196
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY CHANCE

02:11.263 --> 02:13.763
THEY'RE DIGGING
NEAR OUR LAIR,
MASTER SPLINTER?

02:13.765 --> 02:17.399
I DO NOT KNOW, BUT
THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS.

02:17.467 --> 02:19.366
PROFESSOR,
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA

02:19.434 --> 02:22.635
WHICH PRIMITIVE CULTURE
MIGHT HAVE BUILT THIS TEMPLE?

02:22.670 --> 02:24.336
I'M AFRAID NOT,
MS. O'NEIL.

02:24.403 --> 02:25.870
WE HAVEN'T A CLUE.

02:25.904 --> 02:28.271
AND SO THE WORLD
EAGERLY AWAITS

02:28.339 --> 02:30.773
THE ANSWERS
TO THIS MYSTERY.

02:30.807 --> 02:34.042
<i>THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL.
HAPPY HOUR NEWS.</i>

02:34.110 --> 02:37.409
THAT'S ENOUGH,
YOU TV STARS.
BACK TO WORK.

02:42.714 --> 02:44.747
WHAT A WAY TO LIVE!

02:44.815 --> 02:47.115
HERE WE GO GATHERING
TRASH IN MAY

02:47.183 --> 02:49.617
TRASH IN MAY,
TRASH IN MAY

02:49.685 --> 02:50.884
WHAT?

02:50.952 --> 02:55.253
WHAT ARE THESE FREAKS
DOING IN MY CATACOMBS?

03:07.294 --> 03:09.961
AH, GOOD RIDDANCE
TO BAD RUBBISH!

03:10.029 --> 03:11.429
WHO NEEDS YOU?

03:11.497 --> 03:14.030
TEMPLE, EH?

03:14.098 --> 03:15.664
DECORATE IT WITH
A LITTLE GARBAGE,

03:15.731 --> 03:18.499
AND THIS PLACE
MIGHT BE HALF LIVABLE.

03:18.601 --> 03:20.500
I CAN STAY HERE
AND PLOT MY REVENGE

03:20.568 --> 03:22.701
AGAINST SHREDDER--
OOH HOO HOO!

03:22.769 --> 03:24.502
AND KRANG--
OOH HOO HOO!

03:24.570 --> 03:27.438
AND THOSE TURTLES.
DEVIL! OOH HOO HO!

03:27.472 --> 03:28.605
I'LL FIX THEM--

03:28.672 --> 03:30.839
JAMMING ME
INTO THAT OTHER DIMENSION,

03:30.907 --> 03:33.574
TURNING ME
INTO THIS CREATURE,

03:33.642 --> 03:35.709
AND THEN TRYING
TO DEEP-FREEZE ME!

03:35.777 --> 03:37.643
I'LL GET EVEN
WITH THEM ALL!

03:37.711 --> 03:39.510
I WILL! I WILL!

03:39.578 --> 03:42.846
WHY, THIS ISN'T A TEMPLE.

03:42.914 --> 03:46.047
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S A SPACESHIP.

03:46.115 --> 03:48.182
WHO ARE YOU?
WHERE ARE YOU?

03:48.250 --> 03:51.117
I'M EVERYWHERE.
I'M THE SHIP'S COMPUTER.

03:51.118 --> 03:54.452
IF THIS IS A SPACESHIP,
WHERE'S THE PILOT?

03:54.520 --> 03:56.887
YOU EARTHLINGS AREN'T
TOO BRIGHT, ARE YOU?

03:56.955 --> 03:59.355
IT CRASHED HERE
300 YEARS AGO.

03:59.423 --> 04:02.223
I'VE BEEN SO LONELY
THESE PAST 3 CENTURIES.

04:02.291 --> 04:05.458
WHAT SAY WE BE FRIENDS?
HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

04:05.526 --> 04:09.060
CAN THIS SPACESHIP
OF YOURS FLY TO
ANOTHER DIMENSION,

04:09.128 --> 04:10.662
SAY, DIMENSION X?

04:10.728 --> 04:13.796
OH, SURE. BEEN THERE
DOZENS OF TIMES.

04:13.864 --> 04:17.265
WORST RESTAURANTS
IN THE ENTIRE
SPACE/TIME CONTINUUM.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.298
WHAT? HOW CAN IT DO THAT?

04:19.367 --> 04:21.767
IT'S GOT A TRANSDIMENSIONAL
WARP DRIVE.

04:21.836 --> 04:23.035
SHOW IT TO ME.

04:23.103 --> 04:25.303
IT'S LOCATED
ON THE POWER DECK.

04:28.239 --> 04:29.938
THERE IT IS.

04:31.006 --> 04:33.707
THE PERFECT LURE.
KRANG AND SHREDDER

04:33.775 --> 04:35.042
WOULD SELL THEIR
OWN MOTHERS

04:35.109 --> 04:37.076
TO A PET STORE
FOR THIS!

04:37.178 --> 04:38.743
CAN IT BE TAKEN OUT?

04:38.811 --> 04:41.445
I SUPPOSE, BUT WHY?

04:41.513 --> 04:45.181
I NEED THE PARTS
AS BAIT FOR A TRAP!

04:47.816 --> 04:51.484
WHY WON'T THIS
DIMENSIONAL PORTAL
GENERATOR WORK?

04:51.551 --> 04:54.185
I NEED FUEL AND MATERIALS
FROM DIMENSION X.

04:54.253 --> 04:57.521
WHY CAN'T
THIS BLASTED MACHINE
MAKE CONTACT WITH IT?

04:58.789 --> 05:01.656
BECAUSE THE ENTIRE
TECHNODROME

05:01.724 --> 05:03.624
IS LOW ON POWER,
SHREDDER.

05:03.692 --> 05:07.192
I CAN BARELY
KEEP MY NIGHT LIGHT
BURNING.

05:07.260 --> 05:11.628
I KNOW. I MUST FIND
A NEW SOURCE OF POWER.

05:11.730 --> 05:16.631
I MUST, I MUST
GET OUT OF HERE AND
CONQUER THE WORLD!

05:16.699 --> 05:19.600
OH, NOT TODAY, BOSS.

05:19.668 --> 05:22.001
BEBOP AND ME
MADE PLANS.

05:22.069 --> 05:27.103
YEAH. YOU SAID WE COULD
HAVE THE AFTERNOON OFF.

05:27.171 --> 05:28.672
NOT ANYMORE.

05:28.739 --> 05:30.572
YOU'RE WORKING
THIS AFTERNOON.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.940
START BY
TAKING OUT
THE GARBAGE.

05:32.975 --> 05:37.543
OH, BUT WHY NOT USE
THE AUTO-INCINERATORS?

05:37.611 --> 05:40.479
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T
ENOUGH POWER LEFT
TO RUN THEM.

05:40.545 --> 05:41.879
NOW GO!

05:45.381 --> 05:47.815
GEE, WE SURE HAVE PUNCHED

05:47.882 --> 05:49.816
A LOT OF HOLES
IN THE EARTH

05:49.884 --> 05:52.984
BRINGING THOSE
PNEUMATIC MODULES
TO THE SURFACE.

05:54.119 --> 05:55.886
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

05:55.921 --> 05:58.554
GREETINGS, MUTANTS.

05:58.622 --> 06:02.956
B-B-BAXTER,
W-WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

06:03.024 --> 06:05.724
I BROUGHT
A LITTLE PRESENT
FOR YOUR BOSS.

06:05.792 --> 06:09.428
OH, GEE,
IT'S PRETTY.

06:09.495 --> 06:12.729
TELL HIM
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

06:13.897 --> 06:15.964
BOSS! BOSS!

06:16.032 --> 06:17.932
NOT NOW,
YOU CRETINS!

06:18.000 --> 06:19.665
CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M BUSY?

06:19.733 --> 06:22.201
OH, BUT LOOK AT
WHAT WE GOT.

06:22.269 --> 06:24.435
LET ME SEE THAT.

06:24.537 --> 06:27.504
WHY, THIS IS
BERYLLIUM CRYSTAL.

06:27.572 --> 06:28.905
BERYLLIUM?

06:28.972 --> 06:32.206
THE CORE OF
A TRANSDIMENSIONAL
WARP DRIVE

06:32.273 --> 06:35.809
THAT COULD FLY
THE TECHNODROME ANYWHERE,

06:35.877 --> 06:38.376
EVEN TO DIMENSION X.

06:38.444 --> 06:40.745
WHERE DID YOU GET
[BURP] THIS?

06:40.813 --> 06:44.179
THAT FLY GUY BAXTER
GAVE IT TO US.

06:44.247 --> 06:46.147
BAXTER STOCKMAN?

06:46.115 --> 06:49.917
HE SAID THERE WAS PLENTY
WHERE THIS CAME FROM.

06:49.985 --> 06:51.317
I DON'T LIKE IT.

06:51.418 --> 06:53.986
WE TURNED
THAT LITTLE PEST
INTO A FLY.

06:54.053 --> 06:56.487
WHY SHOULD
HE BE DOING US
ANY FAVORS?

06:56.554 --> 06:58.388
WHO CARES?

06:58.455 --> 07:01.923
I NEVER LOOK
A GIFT HORSEFLY
IN THE MOUTH.

07:01.991 --> 07:04.091
YOU MUST GO AFTER HIM.

07:04.158 --> 07:07.292
AND LEAVE
YOUR COM LINK ON
AT ALL TIMES.

07:07.394 --> 07:11.962
I WANT TO PERSONALLY
SUPERVISE THIS MISSION.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.062
VERY WELL.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.796
WE'LL TAKE
THE FOOT SKIS.

07:14.864 --> 07:17.464
AT LEAST THEY STILL
HAVE SOME FUEL.

07:23.769 --> 07:26.937
THERE'S SOMETHING
OVER THERE.

07:27.005 --> 07:29.638
IT'S ANOTHER SECTION
OF THE WARP DRIVE.

07:29.706 --> 07:31.406
AND LOOK THERE--

07:31.473 --> 07:32.906
ANOTHER ONE!

07:34.542 --> 07:37.409
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
HE WERE LEADING US ON.

07:37.477 --> 07:39.210
SO WHAT!

07:39.278 --> 07:42.946
I MUST HAVE
ALL THE PIECES
OF THAT WARP DRIVE.

07:43.014 --> 07:44.413
FORWARD!

07:46.782 --> 07:48.815
THE WAY
I FIGURE IT,

07:48.883 --> 07:50.317
THOSE ARCHAEOLOGISTS
ARE DIGGING CLOSE

07:50.385 --> 07:52.017
TO THE UNDERGROUND
RIVER.

07:52.085 --> 07:54.285
YEAH, BUT IF THEY
DISCOVER OUR LAIR,

07:54.353 --> 07:55.685
WE'LL NEVER BE SAFE.

07:55.753 --> 07:58.521
<i>SO, LIKE, WHAT DO
WE DO, COMPADRES?</i>

07:58.589 --> 08:00.956
I THINK WE'D
BETTER PAY THEM
A VISIT.

08:01.024 --> 08:02.923
SINCE WE'LL BE
GOING BY WATER,

08:02.991 --> 08:05.858
THIS GIVES ME
A CHANCE TO TRY OUT
MY NEWEST INVENTION.

08:05.926 --> 08:08.127
OH, I'M ALMOST
AFRAID TO LOOK.

08:12.062 --> 08:13.195
ALL RIGHT!

08:13.263 --> 08:16.798
JUST THE THING
FOR A WAVE-WHACKING
WATER PARTY.

08:16.866 --> 08:19.432
I'LL USE THIS
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

08:20.834 --> 08:25.136
COWABUNGA! I REALLY DIG
SEWER SURFING.

08:25.203 --> 08:28.271
AH, YES, THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE A PEACEFUL CRUISE

08:28.338 --> 08:29.704
DOWN THE RIVER.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.472
IT'S SHREDDER!

08:33.541 --> 08:37.009
FORGET DOWN THE RIVER.
WE'RE UP THE CREEK!

08:41.880 --> 08:45.013
THE TURTLES!
ANNIHILATE THEM!

08:45.081 --> 08:48.081
WHAT THE HECK
ARE THOSE CREEPAZOIDS
DOING HERE?

08:48.149 --> 08:49.982
WHEN WE'VE STOPPED THEM,
YOU CAN ASK THEM.

08:50.050 --> 08:52.017
TURTLE POWER!

08:54.453 --> 08:57.587
YOU SHELLHEADS
GOT TO DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

09:02.024 --> 09:04.291
SAVE SOME OF THEM
FOR ME.

09:09.061 --> 09:12.395
THIS IS LIKE
SHOOTIN' TURTLES
IN A BARREL.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.866
OH, DUDE!

09:19.934 --> 09:23.868
WHAT A TOTALLY
TUBULAR EXPERIENCE.

09:23.936 --> 09:26.203
THOSE FOOT SKIS
ARE AWESOME.

09:28.505 --> 09:31.273
WATCH OUT, DUDES!

09:31.174 --> 09:34.974
IF YOU THINK
THAT'S SOMETHING,
WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.076
I'M GETTING
TOO OLD FOR THIS.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.777
QUICK, DIVE!

09:46.081 --> 09:48.015
I THINK WE'VE FINALLY
SEEN THE LAST

09:48.083 --> 09:50.850
OF THOSE
REPULSIVE REPTILES.

09:50.885 --> 09:51.717
THEN HARD WORK.

09:51.785 --> 09:53.185
I MUST GET THE REST

09:53.252 --> 09:56.419
OF THAT
TRANSDIMENSIONAL
WARP DRIVE.

10:01.089 --> 10:02.890
I WONDER WHY SHREDDER
WOULD BE INTERESTED

10:02.957 --> 10:05.057
IN AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG?

10:05.159 --> 10:08.659
WHATEVER IT IS,
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT
THE REASON.

10:08.727 --> 10:12.328
HEY, I WONDER
IF THIS HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT.

10:12.396 --> 10:13.762
WHAT IS IT?

10:13.830 --> 10:16.497
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT SURE IS WEIRD.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.699
I'D BETTER
HANG ON TO IT
JUST IN CASE.

10:18.766 --> 10:21.500
THEY'LL
BE HERE SOON!
WHAT TO DO?

10:21.567 --> 10:24.301
ALL RIGHT
DON'T BLOW A CIRCUIT.

10:24.369 --> 10:26.269
TELL ME WHAT'S THE MATTER.

10:26.337 --> 10:28.704
COMPANY IS COMING,
AND I'M NOT EVEN READY.

10:28.772 --> 10:30.605
I'VE GOT TO MAKE
PREPARATIONS!

10:30.673 --> 10:32.006
I MUST FIND SOMETHING

10:32.074 --> 10:34.673
TO BLOW THEM TO
SMITHEREENS.

10:34.741 --> 10:37.943
WERE THESE VISITORS
THE ONES WHO TURNED YOU
INTO A FLY?

10:38.011 --> 10:39.410
EXACTLY RIGHT!

10:39.477 --> 10:41.978
THAT'S WHY I MUST
HAVE MY REVENGE.

10:42.045 --> 10:44.513
THEN I THINK I HAVE
JUST THE THING.

10:44.580 --> 10:45.680
CLOSER.

10:45.748 --> 10:47.515
THIS LOOKS PROMISING.

10:47.582 --> 10:51.116
MY SENSORS INDICATE
A RAT ON DECK A,
COMPARTMENT 12.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.385
GO FOR IT.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.718
WITH PLEASURE.

10:54.785 --> 10:56.119
THERE IT IS.

10:56.187 --> 10:59.154
ALL RIGHT.
YOU DIRTY RAT.

11:00.689 --> 11:03.090
IT TURNED HIM
INTO AN ANT!

11:03.158 --> 11:05.691
WHAT THE HECK
KIND OF A GUN IS THIS?

11:05.759 --> 11:07.225
IT'S A MUTA-ZOO RAY.

11:07.293 --> 11:10.660
IT CAN TURN ANY ANYONE
INTO ANY ANIMAL YOU WANT.

11:10.728 --> 11:12.229
LOOK AT THE DIAL.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.663
YOU MEAN,
THIS GUN CAN TURN PEOPLE

11:14.731 --> 11:17.497
INTO ALL THESE
DIFFERENT CREATURES?

11:17.565 --> 11:19.464
PRECISELY.

11:19.532 --> 11:23.435
OH, BOY, AM I GOING
TO HAVE FUN
WITH THIS GADGET!

11:23.503 --> 11:27.470
AH, WE'RE NEVER GONNA
CATCH UP WITH THEM
AT THIS RATE.

11:27.538 --> 11:29.872
HANG ON!
THERE'S A SHORTCUT
COMING UP!

11:29.939 --> 11:32.673
AT LAST, OUT OF
THAT SCUMMY WATER,

11:32.741 --> 11:34.407
AND INTO A NICE
GRUNGY TUNNEL.

11:35.809 --> 11:38.609
GOOD. ANOTHER SECTION.

11:38.678 --> 11:40.878
ATTACH IT TO THE END
OF THE DRIVE.

11:40.945 --> 11:43.445
THE TRANSDIMENSIONAL
WARP DRIVE

11:43.513 --> 11:45.479
IS ALMOST COMPLETE.

11:45.547 --> 11:48.582
IT'S JUST MISSING
ONE FINAL PIECE.

11:48.648 --> 11:50.450
ONWARD.

11:50.518 --> 11:53.651
WAIT, KRANG. THIS
IS OBVIOUSLY A TRAP.

11:53.718 --> 11:56.119
BAXTER STOCKMAN IS
JUST LURING US ON.

11:56.186 --> 11:59.155
WE CAN HANDLE
THAT, BUG BRAIN!

11:59.222 --> 12:00.755
NOW MOVE.

12:02.290 --> 12:05.891
INTO THE TUNNEL,
QUICKLY.

12:10.561 --> 12:12.661
I DON'T LIKE THIS
ONE LITTLE BIT, KRANG.

12:12.729 --> 12:14.229
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

12:14.297 --> 12:15.363
WHO CARES?

12:15.431 --> 12:17.765
I MUST HAVE
THE FINAL PIECE

12:17.832 --> 12:21.100
OF THE TRANSDIMENSIONAL
WARP DRIVE!

12:21.167 --> 12:23.368
I WONDER IF
HE MEANS THIS?

12:23.435 --> 12:25.135
IT MUST BE IN THERE.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.103
SOMEONE HAS TO RETRIEVE IT.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.972
BEBOP. ROCKSTEADY.
I VOLUNTEER YOU TWO.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.240
WAIT. YOU SAID
IT WAS DANGEROUS.

12:34.308 --> 12:38.009
YEAH! WHY SHOULD WE
STICK OUR NECKS OUT?

12:38.076 --> 12:40.610
IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL CUT YOU
INTO FISH BAIT

12:40.678 --> 12:42.745
AND THROW YOU
TO THE SEA SLUGS.

12:42.813 --> 12:47.447
WELL, OK, AS LONG AS
YOU ASK IN A NICE WAY.

12:47.515 --> 12:50.616
WHY AREN'T YOU
USING THE MUTA-ZOO RAY
ON THEM?

12:50.684 --> 12:54.351
BECAUSE NOTHING
COULD MAKE THOSE TWO
LOOK ANY WORSE.

12:54.419 --> 12:56.252
ALL CLEAR, BOSS.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.720
IT'S SAFE
TO COME IN.

12:58.788 --> 13:00.422
THINK WE SHOULD
GET INVOLVED
IN THIS?

13:00.489 --> 13:01.989
I'M IN NO HURRY.

13:02.057 --> 13:03.890
WHAT IS
THIS PLACE?

13:03.958 --> 13:07.659
THIS MUST BE
A PAN-DIMENSIONAL
SPACE SHIP.

13:07.726 --> 13:09.326
WE CAN INSTALL
THE WARP DRIVE

13:09.394 --> 13:12.795
AND LEAVE
FOR DIMENSION X AT ONCE.

13:12.863 --> 13:16.230
EXCEPT THAT
BAXTER STOCKMAN
IS ON BOARD SOMEWHERE.

13:17.799 --> 13:20.399
WHAT A GOOD GUESSER
YOU ARE.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.735
AT LAST, SHREDDER,
I'M GOING
TO PAY YOU BACK

13:23.802 --> 13:25.535
FOR WHAT YOU DID
TO ME.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.669
EASY, BAXTER.

13:27.804 --> 13:30.471
AND NOW YOU'RE
GOING TO KNOW
HOW IT FEELS.

13:30.539 --> 13:33.607
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO
SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

13:33.674 --> 13:36.607
AS A FLY.

13:40.245 --> 13:42.145
WHAT WAS THAT SCREAM?

13:42.213 --> 13:44.512
WE'D BETTER
CHECK IT OUT.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.480
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

13:46.548 --> 13:48.414
I'M A FLY.

13:48.449 --> 13:51.116
ALL RIGHT, BAXTER,
BUZZ OFF.

13:51.084 --> 13:53.951
OH, BOY!
THE TURTLES!

13:53.986 --> 13:56.486
MY LIFE IS COMPLETE.

13:58.888 --> 14:00.088
WHERE'S MICHELANGELO?

14:00.155 --> 14:01.755
HE WAS HERE
A MINUTE AGO.

14:01.823 --> 14:03.323
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

14:03.390 --> 14:05.057
HE'S BEEN
TURNED INTO

14:05.125 --> 14:08.526
A TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA GERBIL!

14:13.730 --> 14:15.496
WHO DOES BAXTER
THINK HE IS

14:15.564 --> 14:18.065
TURNING MICHELANGELO
INTO A GERBIL.

14:18.133 --> 14:20.599
I'M STARTIN'
TO GET MAD!

14:20.667 --> 14:21.799
YOU'RE MAD?

14:21.867 --> 14:24.535
HOW DO YOU THINK
I FEEL ABOUT IT, DUDE?

14:24.569 --> 14:27.437
BOSS, ARE YOU OK?

14:27.504 --> 14:29.738
UH, WHERE ARE YOU, BOSS?

14:31.273 --> 14:33.873
I'M RIGHT HERE.
HERE I AM.

14:33.941 --> 14:37.375
AW, GET AWAY,
YOU PESKY FLY.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.676
STOP, YOU FOOL.

14:39.743 --> 14:41.445
IT'S ME.

14:41.545 --> 14:45.280
LOOK, BEBOP,
IT'S THE BOSS.

14:45.348 --> 14:47.982
UH, NEAT TRICK, BOSS.

14:48.049 --> 14:50.216
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

14:50.284 --> 14:52.451
BAXTER FLY DID IT,
YOU IDIOT.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.085
NOW GET ME
OUT OF HERE

14:54.152 --> 14:56.919
BEFORE HE DOES
ANYTHING MORE TO ME!

14:59.389 --> 15:01.888
WHAT DO WE
DO NOW, KRANG?

15:01.956 --> 15:03.890
BRING THE WARP DRIVE.

15:03.957 --> 15:05.958
SURE THING, KRANG.

15:06.026 --> 15:10.294
BEBOP,
GET THAT WARP
THING-A-MA-JIG.

15:10.395 --> 15:14.062
NOW, BAXTER,
GET THE WARP DRIVE
BEFORE THEY DO.

15:14.130 --> 15:17.430
OK, OK,
LET'S NOT GET PUSHY.

15:17.498 --> 15:18.765
WHO WAS THAT?

15:18.833 --> 15:20.532
UH, THE SHIP'S
COMPUTER, MAYBE?

15:20.600 --> 15:23.668
GIVE ME THAT WARP DRIVE.
I WANT IT BACK!

15:23.735 --> 15:28.337
COME AND CLOSER AND YOU'LL
WIND UP ON MY WINDSHIELD.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.374
WHY THANK YOU,
HOG BREATH.

15:34.442 --> 15:36.742
OOH, WE BETTER SCRAM

15:36.776 --> 15:40.043
BEFORE HE TURNS US
INTO SOMETHING UGLY.

15:42.244 --> 15:44.478
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GO AFTER BAXTER.

15:44.546 --> 15:47.146
SWELL, SO HE CAN
TURN US INTO WOMBATS?

15:47.214 --> 15:48.915
WE GOT TO GET
THAT RAY GUN
AWAY FROM HIM.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.516
IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE
OF GETTING

15:50.584 --> 15:52.316
MICHELANGELO
BACK TO NORMAL.

15:52.384 --> 15:53.151
YEAH.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.119
HOW AM I GONNA
SCARE BAD GUYS

15:55.187 --> 15:57.553
WHEN I LOOK
LIKE THIS?

15:57.621 --> 16:00.354
WHAT DO WE
DO NOW, KRANG?

16:00.389 --> 16:03.690
WE MUST GET
THAT WEAPON FROM BAXTER

16:03.724 --> 16:05.991
AND RETURN SHREDDER
TO NORMAL.

16:06.059 --> 16:08.225
BEBOP. ROCKSTEADY.

16:08.293 --> 16:10.193
YOU TWO GO IN THERE
AND GET IT.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.861
UH, OK, BOSS.

16:11.928 --> 16:17.164
HEY, HOW COME WE
GOT TO TAKE ORDERS
FROM AN INSECT?

16:17.232 --> 16:21.132
BECAUSE I'M YOUR SUPERIOR,
YOU MISERABLE MUTANT.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.034
OH, YEAH?

16:23.101 --> 16:26.036
NOW WHO'S THE BOSS?

16:26.103 --> 16:29.138
VERY WELL.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.504
WHAT ARE YOUR DEMANDS?

16:31.572 --> 16:33.574
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

16:33.641 --> 16:36.841
I'LL BE IT'S THAT COMPUTER
THAT WAS TALKING TO BAXTER.

16:36.909 --> 16:38.609
I'LL BET
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:38.676 --> 16:40.344
WHERE'S BAXTER?

16:40.411 --> 16:42.611
WHAT'S HE DONE
WITH THE MUTATION GUN?

16:42.679 --> 16:43.912
I'M NOT TELLING.

16:43.980 --> 16:46.847
BAXTER'S MY FRIEND,
AND I LIKE HIM.

16:46.914 --> 16:50.048
WE HAVE WAYS
OF MAKING YOU TALK.

16:50.116 --> 16:53.418
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON'T TOUCH THAT LEVER.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.819
NOW, WHERE'S BAXTER?

16:58.887 --> 17:01.388
I...I CAN'T REMEMBER.

17:01.456 --> 17:04.757
A FEW THOUSAND VOLTS
OUGHT TO JOB YOUR
MEMORY CHIPS.

17:04.825 --> 17:06.958
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.325
HE'S ON THE BRIDGE.

17:08.393 --> 17:10.792
HE'S GOING TO FLY
THE SPACESHIP
TO DIMENSION X.

17:10.861 --> 17:12.527
IS THERE
ANY PROTECTION

17:12.595 --> 17:14.328
AGAINST THAT
MUTATION RAY?

17:14.396 --> 17:16.496
YES, THERE IS
ONE THING--

17:16.564 --> 17:19.330
GO UP TO "C" DECK.
AND YOU'LL FIND...

17:19.398 --> 17:22.200
AND I WANT

17:22.267 --> 17:23.467
A LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION

17:23.535 --> 17:26.167
TO MY FAVORITE
COMIC BOOKS.

17:26.236 --> 17:28.936
YOU'RE WASTING
VALUABLE TIME.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.771
THE TURTLES
ARE IN THERE.

17:30.838 --> 17:33.539
THEY MIGHT HAVE
THE GUN ALREADY.

17:33.607 --> 17:36.141
THERE, IT'S DONE.

17:36.209 --> 17:38.242
NOW TO MAKE
THIS BIRD FLY.

17:38.310 --> 17:40.343
NOT SO FAST, BAXTER.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.911
MONSTERS!

17:48.448 --> 17:51.116
WE'LL JUST TAKE THAT,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

17:51.184 --> 17:53.918
NOT IN THIS
LIFETIME.

17:54.952 --> 17:57.419
YOU HAIRY
LITTLE SCUZ BUCKET!

17:57.486 --> 18:00.054
SORRY. YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO FIND IT FOR YOURSELF,

18:00.121 --> 18:02.322
AND YOU'VE GOT
3 MINUTES TO DO IT,

18:02.389 --> 18:06.591
THAT IS, UNLESS
YOU WANT TO COME ALONG
WITH ME TO DIMENSION X!

18:16.564 --> 18:18.865
THERE IT GOES!

18:18.933 --> 18:20.365
QUICK! AFTER IT!

18:22.968 --> 18:24.167
WHAT ARE--

18:24.235 --> 18:27.369
THIS MUST BE
THE SHIP'S GALLEY.

18:27.437 --> 18:28.870
YOU SEE, GASTON?

18:28.938 --> 18:31.838
I TOLD YOU WE
WOULD FIND TURTLES
FOR THE TURTLE SOUP.

18:31.906 --> 18:34.040
JULIENNE THEM QUICKLY.

18:34.107 --> 18:35.873
YOU WAIT HERE,
LITTLE BUDDY.

18:35.909 --> 18:38.008
WHO COULD HAVE
TOLD THEM THERE WERE
TURTLES COMING?

18:38.076 --> 18:40.243
WHY, ME, OF COURSE.

18:40.310 --> 18:43.846
I AM PROGRAMMED
TO MAKE SUPPER OUT OF YOU.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.046
THEN I'LL
JUST HAVE TO DO
SOME REPROGRAMMING.

18:49.916 --> 18:52.583
"FOOD-O-MATIC
INSTRUCTIONS."

18:52.651 --> 18:54.051
TURTLE SOUP, HUH?

18:54.119 --> 18:57.418
HURRY UP, BOY GENIUS.
START COOKING UP
SOMETHING.

18:57.486 --> 18:59.187
THIS OUGHT TO DO IT.

19:03.558 --> 19:05.256
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO THEM?

19:05.325 --> 19:09.158
SIMPLE. I PROGRAMMED THEM
TO MAKE CHOPPED ROBOT SALAD.

19:10.628 --> 19:13.294
NOW TO TAKE CARE
OF MICHELANGELO.

19:16.398 --> 19:19.365
HE'S BACK TO NORMAL.

19:19.433 --> 19:22.000
MICHELANGELO,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:22.067 --> 19:23.434
WHAT DO YOU
FEEL LIKE?

19:23.502 --> 19:26.668
WHOA, I FEEL LIKE A PIZZA!

19:26.736 --> 19:28.771
HE'S BACK TO NORMAL,
ALL RIGHT.

19:28.772 --> 19:31.404
THE TRANSDIMENSIONAL
WARP DRIVE

19:31.472 --> 19:32.639
IS WARMED UP.

19:32.773 --> 19:34.406
WE'D BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.610
HOW WE GONNA GET
THAT GIZMO, ANYWAY?

19:40.844 --> 19:43.612
DOES THAT
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

19:43.679 --> 19:44.812
GIMME THAT!

19:44.880 --> 19:47.547
HEY, HOG-BREATH,
GIVE THAT BACK!

19:47.614 --> 19:50.682
THE SPACESHIP...
IT'S ABOUT TO BLAST OFF!

19:50.750 --> 19:53.251
LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE!

19:58.087 --> 20:00.620
BAXTER'S TAKING OFF
FOR DIMENSION X!

20:00.755 --> 20:02.688
GEE, I DON'T
THINK HE'S GONNA

20:02.756 --> 20:04.690
GET VERY FAR
WITHOUT THIS.

20:05.958 --> 20:07.891
ADIOS, EARTH!

20:07.959 --> 20:10.627
<i>WILKOMMEN,
DIMENSION X!</i>

20:10.695 --> 20:12.594
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

20:12.662 --> 20:16.596
DID YOU REMEMBER
TO PUT THE RETAINING BOLT
IN THE WARP DRIVE ASSEMBLY?

20:16.664 --> 20:18.997
NOW, HOW WOULD I REMEMBER?

20:19.065 --> 20:21.332
I HAVE THE BRAIN
OF A FLY!

20:21.367 --> 20:26.135
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A TERRIFIC 483 YEARS.

20:29.105 --> 20:30.804
WHERE AM I?

20:30.872 --> 20:32.705
THIS ISN'T DIMENSION X!

20:32.773 --> 20:35.607
WHAT MORE CAN HAPPEN TO ME?

20:38.709 --> 20:42.378
HELP ME! HELP ME!

20:44.547 --> 20:46.746
YOU'VE GOT
THE MUTA-ZOO GUN.

20:46.814 --> 20:49.248
TURN IT UP
TO NORMAL--NOW!

20:49.316 --> 20:51.982
WHAT'S
THE MAGIC WORD?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.717
OH, VERY WELL.

20:53.785 --> 20:56.152
PLEASE.

20:56.220 --> 20:59.853
WELL, UH...
WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

21:04.424 --> 21:07.558
I WONDER WHAT
HAPPENED TO THOSE
ARCHAEOLOGISTS.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.626
YEAH, THOSE DUDES
COULD BE DIGGING

21:09.694 --> 21:12.394
INTO OUR
PIZZA PANTRY ANY MINUTE.

21:12.461 --> 21:15.830
LET'S FIND OUT
IF APRIL IS DOING
A REPORT ON THE DIG.

21:15.897 --> 21:17.497
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

21:17.564 --> 21:19.832
FIRST THAT
HORRIBLE MONSTER...

21:19.899 --> 21:23.432
AND NOW, THE TEMPLE
HAS VANISHED.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.201
PROFESSOR,
DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE

21:25.269 --> 21:27.469
FOR YOUR FELLOW
ARCHAEOLOGISTS?

21:27.537 --> 21:29.037
ONLY ONE--

21:29.105 --> 21:30.938
STAY AWAY
FROM THIS AREA!

21:31.005 --> 21:33.605
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T DIG HERE!

21:33.673 --> 21:36.307
THIS ENTIRE PLACE
IS CURSED!

21:36.375 --> 21:37.841
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

21:37.909 --> 21:40.109
WE'VE BEEN
SAVED BY SCIENCE.
