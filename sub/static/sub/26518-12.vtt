00:11.512 --> 00:12.673
Here she is.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.380
Thank you.
Hey.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.635
Hey.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.591
<i>Do you... do you
want anything?</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:20.802
How 'bout my vision back?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.354
I, uh...

00:24.691 --> 00:26.182
I want
to beat this.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.896
I want to go home.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.894
We all want that.

00:30.072 --> 00:32.234
And I say "all"
because...

00:33.825 --> 00:35.316
Patterson and Rich
came to see you.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.280
- What?
<i>- Hey.</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:37.739
- Hey!
- Hey, Jane!

00:37.913 --> 00:40.621
- You look great!
- Why are you yelling?

00:40.791 --> 00:41.791
She's not deaf.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.040
Although,
I may be now.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.417
Ah, you've still got

00:44.586 --> 00:45.906
your sense of humor.
That's great.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.046
<i>Okay, yup.</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:48.921
<i>Any new leads
on the stem cells?</i>

00:49.466 --> 00:51.706
<i>Yeah, we had a major
breakthrough last night.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:54.085
Patterson found
a lead in the cache.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.845
Now Roman is pointing us

00:56.014 --> 00:57.880
<i>toward this billionaire
named Ken Lee.</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:01.847
He has his own private
medical collection.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.386
Including
the Stanton cells

01:03.564 --> 01:04.763
that we believe
could cure you.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.306
<i>Ken has
the stem cells</i>

01:06.483 --> 01:08.850
<i>because he's a major
hypochondriac and agoraphobe.</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:11.519
Supposedly, he hasn't
left his place in years.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.799
So, how do we...
how do we get

01:12.823 --> 01:14.780
these stem cells?
Do we buy them?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.803
Not unless you got a spare
billion layin' around.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.991
There has to be some
