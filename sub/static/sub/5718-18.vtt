WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:08.309
Okay. Mr. Richman's flu
has been vanquished.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.444
Who's next in line
to be...

00:10.511 --> 00:12.880
* A-feelin' my healin'

00:15.216 --> 00:17.017
Okay. Get ready.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.286
Oh, no.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.588
Just please tell me
it doesn't involve
a hernia exam.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.323
At the risk of sounding
unprofessional,

00:22.390 --> 00:24.358
I hate tugging plums
before lunch.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.461
No. Much better.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.929
Dicky Wexler!

00:28.996 --> 00:30.598
(SQUEALS)

00:32.366 --> 00:33.901
Who's Dicky Wexler?

00:33.967 --> 00:35.403
Dr. Ken's
favorite patient.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.738
He's hilarious.
Old-school comedian.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.473
I've loved him
since I was a kid.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.375
I did one of his routines
word for word

00:41.442 --> 00:43.444
in my fourth grade
talent show. (SCOFFS)

00:43.511 --> 00:45.879
It did not go well,
but in my defense,

00:45.946 --> 00:48.949
I thought he actually went
motor boating with Charo.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.751
(GURGLING)

00:52.153 --> 00:53.587
Ta-da! (LAUGHS)

00:53.654 --> 00:54.955
Dicky!

00:55.022 --> 00:57.325
How's my favorite
pint-sized doc, huh?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.692
Look at this guy.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.294
He's so small,
he could model
for trophies.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.096
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:02.163 --> 01:04.998
Oh, I am not tall.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.301
Clarky, Clarky,
if that dome gets
any shinier,

01:07.368 --> 01:08.536
you can get a job
as lighthouse.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.871
(ALL LAUGH)

01:10.938 --> 01:13.507
Damona, Damona,
you look younger
every year.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.742
Oh!

01:14.808 --> 01:16.610
Then again,
I'm legally blind,
so you do the math.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.079
(ALL LAUGH)

01:19.147 --> 01:21.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who, who...
Who is this?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.651
Hi, Dicky.
I'm Dr. Julie Dobbs.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.286
What do we say
we go down
to the courthouse

01:25.353 --> 01:27.121
and change your name
to Wife Number Five?

01:27.188 --> 01:29.223
(ALL LAUGH)

01:29.290 --> 01:30.724
Oh, hey, hey,
hey, listen.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.059
I got this for you.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.495
My show at the
Tropicana, 1978.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.397
Thanks, Dicky.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.366
I listen to these
whenever I'm in
a bad mood.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.733
So, always?

01:40.668 --> 01:41.869
(CHUCKLES)

01:41.935 --> 01:43.237
People,
a lot of you were late

01:43.304 --> 01:44.638
with your time cards
this week, so...

01:44.705 --> 01:46.274
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.542
Where'd you get this guy,
Bureaucrats "R" Us?

01:48.609 --> 01:51.412
(CHUCKLING)
Okay, okay, Dicky.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.381
Let's get you
to an exam room.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.450
Seriously. If red tape
and boredom had a kid,

01:56.517 --> 01:57.851
it would be that guy.
(LAUGHS)

01:59.820 --> 02:01.322
Because you're boring!

02:01.389 --> 02:02.490
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:03.657 --> 02:04.825
(LAUGHING)

02:12.065 --> 02:13.634
So, what brings you
in today?

02:13.701 --> 02:16.103
There's a benefit show
at the Friars Club
next week,

02:16.170 --> 02:19.407
but they won't let me do it
unless I get cleared
by a doctor.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.609
I guess Charlene
makes them nervous.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.043
I'm sorry. Charlene?

02:23.110 --> 02:25.012
Dicky's had myeloma
for a few years.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.080
Cancer is such
an ugly word.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.849
So I named it Charlene,
after my ex-wife.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.219
(CHUCKLES)

02:31.285 --> 02:32.453
They're each
about as much fun,

02:32.520 --> 02:33.787
and they've had
similar effects on me.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.723
(DR. KEN CHUCKLES)

02:35.789 --> 02:38.058
Well, Dicky, I'm sure
your oncologist
went over this,

02:38.125 --> 02:41.795
but Charlene is kind of
making herself
at home in there.

02:41.862 --> 02:42.896
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.598
I, I know, but listen.
I feel great.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.700
I'm doing my thing.
I'm taking walks.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.902
Look, I'm no athlete,
but neither are you.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.207
Looks like the only
pull-ups you do
are at the drive-through.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.742
(LAUGHS)

02:56.109 --> 02:59.280
I do get winded
on escalators.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.181
So, what do you say?
Will you give me
a doctor's note

03:01.249 --> 03:02.783
so I can do this thing?

03:04.985 --> 03:06.320
All right.
DICKY: All right.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.521
DR. KEN: All right,
I'll make it happen.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.723
Okay. But...

03:09.790 --> 03:11.024
You better
save me a seat

03:11.091 --> 03:13.227
and not a booster seat
like last time.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.496
You didn't.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.598
You got to admit
it was funny.

03:17.665 --> 03:18.732
(BOTH LAUGH)

03:18.799 --> 03:20.200
It was.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.970
And it really did help me see
the stage better, so...

03:28.376 --> 03:30.444
(LAUGHING) Okay, Dicky,
I'll see you at the show.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.712
Thanks again, Doc.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.347
Good luck with that lawsuit
against your barber.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.848
(BOTH LAUGH)

03:34.915 --> 03:37.385
This is not
Supercuts' best work.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.152
Hey, sweetheart.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.188
Let me take you out
for a romantic dinner.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.856
What are you doing
tomorrow at 4:00?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.492
(ALL LAUGH)

03:44.558 --> 03:47.060
All right, all right
all right, I'll see you
when I see you.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.629
(CHUCKLES)

03:48.696 --> 03:51.198
Ah, he always says that.

03:51.265 --> 03:55.168
Dr. Park, are you sure
that Dicky is healthy enough
to do that show?

03:55.235 --> 03:58.038
His platelets
and hemoglobin
are both very low.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.374
Trust me.
The guy's been
performing forever.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.943
He survived
two tours in Vietnam.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.078
USO tours, but still.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.782
Those guys are not
an easy laugh.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.786
Okay. It's just,
you've always told me

04:12.853 --> 04:14.488
not to get too close
to my patients

04:14.555 --> 04:16.056
because it could cloud
my judgment.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.958
My judgment's fine.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.227
Dicky's strong
as an ox, and I know
what he can handle.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.229
I've been his doctor
since you were
a little girl

04:22.296 --> 04:24.365
doing pretend vaccinations
on your dolls.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.868
I told you that
in confidence!

04:29.770 --> 04:31.472
Damona...

04:31.539 --> 04:33.741
Is the old man gone?

04:33.807 --> 04:37.311
I'm having a puffy day,
and I don't feel like enduring
any more of his barbs.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.048
He's gone.
Oh, good.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.551
All right,
quick announcement,
people.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.153
Due to some cockroach eggs
in the pancake batter,

04:46.219 --> 04:48.389
the commissary
will be closed tomorrow.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.190
But today
it's business as usual.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.992
And they're doing
all-you-can-eat pancakes.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.730
Ooh, let's get tacos
for lunch tomorrow.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.633
Oh, actually,
I hate to be
a Johnny-Asserts-Himself

04:59.700 --> 05:02.603
instead of a
Little-Timmy-Goes-Along,

05:02.670 --> 05:05.205
but I believe it's my turn
to choose the restaurant,

05:05.272 --> 05:07.040
and this new vegan place
just opened.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.843
Oh! I would,
but I had yard trimmings
for breakfast.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.514
Just try it, Pat.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.816
Jared Leto's a vegan,
and you love him.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.485
Oh, Leto. Well...

05:17.551 --> 05:19.487
I guess if he can put it
in his beautiful mouth,

05:19.553 --> 05:20.888
I can put it in mine.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.466
Sorry about
the cavities, Molly.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.435
You got to take care
of your teeth.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.870
They're the
white picket fence
of your face house.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.606
(LISPING)
Shut up, Dave.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.642
Dave, don't rub it in.
You just had one
good checkup.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.511
"Good"? It was perfect.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.178
My teeth are so amazing,

05:45.245 --> 05:48.449
you should be
on guard for poachers
coming after me.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.783
Ding!

05:50.884 --> 05:52.820
Okay.
See you Tuesday at 11:00.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.455
Dr. Park.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.056

05:56.123 --> 05:57.458
Great.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.460
Well, bye.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.328
Have a day.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.300
(LISPING)
What was that about?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.836
Just a former patient
of mine.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.303
It's no big deal.

06:11.338 --> 06:14.241
Five years I spent
treating Kate.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.644
She told me
she didn't need
therapy anymore,

06:16.710 --> 06:18.746
but there she was,

06:18.812 --> 06:21.048
waltzing out of another
therapist's office
like she owned the place

06:21.114 --> 06:24.685
literally, as if she had
the deed in her back pocket.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.687
I thought you said
it was no big deal.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.456
And aren't deeds
just for ranches?

06:34.762 --> 06:36.029
When?

06:38.932 --> 06:40.167
Mmm-hmm.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.469
Okay. On my way.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.671
What is it?
Dicky Wexler's
in the hospital.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.140

Who's Dicky Wexler?

06:54.014 --> 06:55.382
I'm fine, Doc.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.284
I got a little tired,
so I took a load off.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.386
You collapsed in a busy
intersection.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.422
Everybody's so touchy
about where you lie down
these days.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.527
You told Dr. Marabi
you've been feeling
really tired

07:06.594 --> 07:08.662
and you're having trouble
getting up the stairs.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.531
But you told me
you felt great.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.501
Okay. So I lied.
I want to do the show.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.635
Even if you're
getting sicker?

07:14.702 --> 07:16.670
Especially
if I'm getting sicker.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.939
Look, Doc...

I don't know
how much time
I got left but...

07:21.108 --> 07:23.977
I want to spend it
doing what I love.
I know, Dicky, but...

07:24.044 --> 07:27.414
Onstage, a drink in my hand,
making people laugh.

That's who I am.

Thanks.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.530
All right, Dicky,
get some rest.

and Woodman.

when I see you.

my pink top?

Okay. So I'm not fine
with Kate

07:55.743 --> 07:57.410
leaving me
for another therapist.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.812
There. I admit it.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.349

on the top?

what I did wrong with her.

Dave, how many bowls
of that blue cereal
have you had?

08:28.075 --> 08:29.610
At least three.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.813
And last night,
he took a bag of Snickers
to bed with him.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.223

about this place

is that the takeout menu
is actually printed
on rice-based paper,

09:20.227 --> 09:21.528
so you can eat it.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.000
Yeah. No.
I am thinking
of a different place.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.304
And make sure
there's some bourbon
in the ambulance.

'Cause that's what
he likes before a show.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.442
Well, just swing
by a liquor store.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.944
A cool paramedic
would do it.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.814
Dr. Park, are you sure

09:40.881 --> 09:43.150
that taking Dicky
out of the hospital
is a good idea?

09:43.216 --> 09:44.918
Hmm, let me check.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.254
Uh, yeah, I am.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.122
I'm just worried
that your feelings

09:49.189 --> 09:50.658
might be clouding
your judgment.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.292
And I'm just worried...
Loser says, "What?"

09:52.359 --> 09:53.827
What?
Aha!

09:54.795 --> 09:57.297
Every time!

09:57.364 --> 09:59.900
Wait. Just answer me
one thing.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.002
If Dicky's chart belonged
to another patient,

10:02.069 --> 10:04.437
would you really
let him leave the hospital?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.207
(SIGHS)

10:08.642 --> 10:10.310
No. I wouldn't.

10:11.879 --> 10:14.114
I'm sorry.
I know this must be
really hard.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.450
How am I gonna
tell him?

10:17.517 --> 10:20.654
Just be honest.
That's always best.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.757
Oh, God,
that vegan chili
smells like Satan's diaper.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.798
Okay,
honesty is usually best.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.912
(GASPS)

10:45.512 --> 10:47.180
Liaress!

10:49.016 --> 10:50.851
You said you liked
my vegan food,

10:50.918 --> 10:53.687
but then you threw it
in the trash after
barely one bite?

10:53.754 --> 10:56.523
Look, I'm sorry, Clark,
but it was just so nasty!

10:56.589 --> 10:57.758
(GASPS)

10:57.825 --> 10:59.226
I had to gargle
with hamburger

10:59.292 --> 11:02.229
just to get the taste
out of my mouth.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.164
What, and you
didn't feel like
you could tell me this?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.699
You wanted us
to like it so bad.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.134
And please don't take this
the wrong way,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.069
but you tend to be
a little over-dramatic.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.337
(GASPS)

11:24.818 --> 11:26.619
Ah. Hey, Doc.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.156
I got my penguin suit
for the show.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.824
That tux
has been through a lot.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.793
You, you see
those stitches?

11:32.860 --> 11:35.395
That's where Don Rickles
stabbed me with a fork.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.431
Truth be told,
I had recently stabbed him
with two forks.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.570
Listen, Dicky...

11:43.636 --> 11:45.672
There's not
gonna be a show.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.074
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.675
It's Charlene.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.643
She's bad.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.780
Charlene's always bad.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.548
Come on...
She got you, Dicky.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.117
This time,
she got you.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.693
In that case,
I got to do the show.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.995
I got to do it.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.730
I'm sorry.

12:10.798 --> 12:14.634
The medically
responsible thing to do
is to keep you here,

12:14.701 --> 12:16.569
monitored, comfortable...

12:16.636 --> 12:19.239
Hey! I'm not
comfortable, okay?

12:19.306 --> 12:20.908
This place stinks.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.410
And the only alcohol
they got is the kind
you can't drink.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.478
Dicky...

12:25.545 --> 12:27.080
Look, Doc.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.681
The club is my home.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.819
Let me go home.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.421
I can't.

12:35.688 --> 12:36.890
I thought you were
my friend.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.192
I am, but I'm also
your doctor.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.760
Yeah, well,
doctors are supposed
to help people.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.130
I am helping you.
No, you're not.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.464
You're worse
than Charlene.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.699
Goodbye.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.639
What?
Oh, for goodness' sake.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.507
Okay, well, well,
they sometimes jam.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.343
You just press
and I'll pull.
I'm pressing. I'm pressing.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.211
You pressed
the wrong button.
Just press the other button.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.512
I'm pressing
the other one.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.248
Okay, well,
now you just
turned on the TV.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.749
Oh, get hell out of here.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.264
I just wish
I could help Dicky
do one last show.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.765
I know.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.033
But try to remember
how much

13:20.100 --> 13:21.701
you have helped him
through the years.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.003
True.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.371
I treated
his hypertension,

13:24.437 --> 13:26.506
his cholesterol,
his adulterer's knee.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.643
Don't beat yourself up
over it.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.812
That's what I realized
about my thing with Kate.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.315
At some point,
you just have to let go
and move on.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.850
Good for you, Mom.
You've moved on.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.553
I haven't moved on.
I just said I should.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.855
Wait.
What did you say?

13:41.922 --> 13:44.691
I should move on.
"Move." That's it!

13:44.757 --> 13:46.659
Where are you going?
I've got an idea,

13:46.726 --> 13:49.963
and it's so crazy
that it just might work!

13:50.030 --> 13:53.166
Actually, it's not that crazy,
but it just might work!

13:56.169 --> 13:58.771
Dave, you've barely
touched your dinner.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.173
I ate too many sweets.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.842
Now my tummy and my butt
aren't friends anymore.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.146
Serves you right,
show-off.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.615
That's what you get
for brushing your teeth
with pudding.

14:09.917 --> 14:13.353
My mistake was hubris.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.456
This all happened
because you took us
to the dentist together.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.991
I want to go to my
next appointment alone.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.227
Wait.
What did you just say?

14:20.293 --> 14:22.195
I want to go to my
next appointment alone?

14:22.963 --> 14:25.265
"Appointment."
That's it!

14:25.332 --> 14:27.100
I have to rearrange
my schedule tomorrow.

14:27.167 --> 14:31.138
I'm gonna get to the
bottom of this Kate thing
once and for all.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.973
Why is everyone having
sudden realizations

14:33.040 --> 14:34.707
based on what other people
are saying?

14:34.774 --> 14:36.609
"Based on."
That's it!

14:38.545 --> 14:40.647
Seriously?
What did you realize?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.815
Nothing. I just want
to be included.

14:51.158 --> 14:54.061
Good morning,
Pat, Julie...

14:54.127 --> 14:57.097
Person whose pants
are on fire
because she's a liar, liar.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.735
Clark, I know you had
no way to know this,

15:02.802 --> 15:05.538
but my Uncle Howard died
in a pants fire.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.678
It's just lunch, Clark.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.380
Is this about the mulch
and cave scrapings

15:13.446 --> 15:16.449
you made everyone
eat yesterday?

15:16.516 --> 15:18.518
How long are you
gonna stay mad
at me about this?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.153
23 days.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.254
(SCOFFS)

15:21.321 --> 15:22.956
No.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.125
23 business days.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.796
Morning, Mr. Clark.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.231
Here's a veggie
breakfast burrito

15:31.298 --> 15:33.733
to repay you for giving me
your lunch yesterday.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.741
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:41.808 --> 15:45.245
Remember? You said
it was a banh mi,
but soon it would be in me.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.317
You gave Juan-Julio
your lunch yesterday?

15:50.984 --> 15:52.052
It's just...

15:53.153 --> 15:54.454
I didn't like it.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.758
(STUTTERING)
I couldn't admit it

15:58.825 --> 16:00.627
because I had talked up
vegan food so much,

16:00.693 --> 16:02.529
but I guess
vegan restaurants

16:02.595 --> 16:03.963
are just like other
restaurants.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.965
Sometimes they suck.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.768
Always they suck.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.606
I'm just...
I'm so sorry, Damona.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.709
Please, can we never
let food come
between us again?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.813
Okay. (CHUCKLES)
Okay.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.782
Except for
ice cream cake.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.817
Where there's ice cream cake,
there are no friends.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.620
I will blind a bitch
for some ice cream cake.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.491
(GAGS)

16:32.959 --> 16:34.961
Oh, I'm sorry,
Juan-Julio.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.196
It's just,
this burrito tastes...

16:36.263 --> 16:37.930
Gross. I know.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.699
It's payback
for giving me
your nasty lunch.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.705
So we understand
each other.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.212
Have a wonderful day
of smiles, everybody!

17:08.461 --> 17:09.662
Kate!

17:09.729 --> 17:11.831
Wow!
Twice in one week.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.032
Yeah.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.367
What are you doing here?

17:15.368 --> 17:18.037
I was about to see my...

17:18.105 --> 17:19.939
Lactation consultant.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.443
I haven't breastfed
in over a decade.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.844
Just want to make sure
everything works

17:24.911 --> 17:27.180
in case I go back to it.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.749
You know, the kids eat
so much junk. (CHUCKLES)

17:31.451 --> 17:33.686
Right.

17:33.753 --> 17:37.056
So, uh, I, I see
you've got
a new therapist.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.725
Look, Dr. Park...

17:38.791 --> 17:40.393
No need to explain.
(CHUCKLES)

17:40.460 --> 17:42.262
I'm a professional.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.097
I'm sure you had
your reasons
for ending our sessions.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.532
Oh, thank you.
I appreciate that.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.867
So, what were they?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.769
Kate.
Is everything okay?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.104
Uh, nope.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.840
Dr. Humes,
this is Dr. Park.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.942
She used to be
my therapist.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.877
Mmm.
Hi. Oh. Yep.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.150
You guys seem really
good together.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.318
Kate is
a pleasure to treat.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.120
She communicates
very well.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.256
Yeah, well,
I kind of taught her
how to do that,

18:09.322 --> 18:11.191
so... (CHUCKLES)
You're welcome.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.127
Dr. Park,
is something wrong?

18:14.194 --> 18:15.995
No... Actually, yes.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.965
Kate left me
and lied about it.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.368
Now she's out
gallivanting around
with her hot new piece

18:21.434 --> 18:23.536
while I'm stuck at home
with the kids.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.874
Dr. Park,
I'm sorry if I hurt
your feelings.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.776
I just wanted
to see what else
was out there.

18:30.743 --> 18:31.944
Oh.

18:32.011 --> 18:35.014
So, it was nothing I did?

18:35.081 --> 18:36.183
No.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.017
In fact, you're the one
who taught me

18:38.084 --> 18:39.886
to venture out
and explore new options.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.689
Oh, right. (CHUCKLES)
I did do that.

18:44.924 --> 18:48.428
Anyway, uh,
it was nice to see you/
meet you.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.129
(LAUGHS) Okay.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.664
Oh, what about
your appointment?

18:51.731 --> 18:53.733
Oh, right, yes.
This whole...

18:53.800 --> 18:55.001
Yeah.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.106
So, can you come at 10:00
next week instead of 11:00?

19:00.173 --> 19:01.741
Oh, I think so.
Good.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.113
Yeah.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.381
Okay. Yep.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.058
Are you ready?

19:19.125 --> 19:20.827
Ready as I'll ever be.

at curing cancer,

how about a sponge bath?

19:50.823 --> 19:52.158
And if that goes well,
you can give me one.

I lost my bag at the airport.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.645
To be honest, she was ready
to leave me anyway.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.013
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

20:47.079 --> 20:49.148
I tell you, Vegas sure is
different than New York.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.917
Here, you ask
for a corned beef sandwich,

20:50.983 --> 20:53.219
a hooker takes you up
to your hotel room
and robs you.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.721
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Hey, don't tell my wife.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.088
I'm not supposed to eat
corned beef.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.790
(LAUGHS)

20:57.857 --> 21:00.527
I joke about my wife,
but to be honest,
I love my mistress.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.028
(CHUCKLES)

21:04.431 --> 21:06.165
See you
when I see you, pal.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.870
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
