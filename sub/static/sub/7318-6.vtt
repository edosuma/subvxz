WEBVTT

00:12.033 --> 00:14.533
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.567 --> 00:15.733
WHAT IS GOING
ON WITH YOU?

00:15.767 --> 00:17.233
THE HOSPITAL GRANTS YOU

00:17.267 --> 00:19.367
FOUR MONTHS TO RETAKE
THE MEDICAL BOARD EXAM.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.367
KAREV,
TAKE THE SCALPEL.
ALEX! COME ON!

00:21.400 --> 00:24.300
YOUR CHOICE?
IT'S SIMPLE. HER OR ME.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.367
ADDISON IS MY FAMILY.
THEN ONE DAY,

00:26.400 --> 00:29.400
I'M SUPPOSED TO SIGN A PIECE
OF PAPER AND END MY FAMILY?

00:29.433 --> 00:30.800
IS THAT YOUR DATE?
THAT'S MY HUSBAND.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.733
YOU'RE MARRIED?
TEN YEARS TODAY.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.467
BURKE WANTS TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.367
OKAY, WE'RE A COUPLE.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.733
SO PICK ME.
CHOOSE ME.

00:38.767 --> 00:41.733
LOVE ME.
I'LL BE AT JOE'S TONIGHT.

00:41.767 --> 00:45.500
SO IF YOU DO DECIDE TO SIGN
THE PAPERS, MEET ME THERE.

00:45.533 --> 00:47.333
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.533
I ACTUALLY SAID
"PICK ME."

00:57.567 --> 00:59.800
RIGHT? I DID?
"PICK ME"?

00:59.833 --> 01:02.067
I THINK IT'S ROMANTIC.
IT'S NOT ROMANTIC, JOE.

01:02.067 --> 01:03.467
IT'S HORRIFYING.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.300
HORROR MOVIE HORRIFYING.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.300
CARRIE AT THE PROM
WITH THE PIG'S BLOOD HORRIFYING.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.333
OKAY, FINE,
IT'S HORRIFYING.

01:09.367 --> 01:13.333
BUT CARRIE TOOK OUT AN ENTIRE
SENIOR CLASS AS REVENGE.

01:13.367 --> 01:15.267
I GOTTA SAY,
I LIKE THAT IN A GIRL.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.833
I SAID "PICK ME."

01:17.867 --> 01:19.767
WHEN YOU TELL SOMEONE I'LL MEET
YOU LATER AT A BAR TONIGHT,

01:19.800 --> 01:22.067
HOW LONG EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT?

01:22.100 --> 01:23.733
DO YOU THINK
HE'S REALLY NOT COMING?

01:23.767 --> 01:26.833
IT IS GETTING
A LITTLE HARD TO WATCH.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.367
IT WAS HARD TO WATCH AN HOUR
AGO. NOW IT'S JUST PATHETIC.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.467
WHO'S PATHETIC?

01:31.500 --> 01:33.300
WHAT?

01:33.333 --> 01:36.267
YOU WHO PRETEND
TO BE MY FRIENDS

01:36.300 --> 01:39.100
ARE CALLING ME PATHETIC
BEHIND MY BACK

01:39.133 --> 01:41.167
IN FRONT OF MY FACE.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.633
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DUMP
THE PIG'S BLOOD ON ME NOW

01:42.667 --> 01:44.400
AND GET IT OVER WITH?

01:49.733 --> 01:52.467
HE'S REALLY NOT COMING.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.633
(pager beeps)

01:53.667 --> 01:55.133
(pager beeps)

01:55.167 --> 01:56.200
JOE, TURN UP THE TV.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.800
(Woman Reporter)
A MASSIVE TRAIN WRECK

01:57.833 --> 02:01.233
OCCURRED JUST OUTSIDE
OF SEATTLE MOMENTS AGO.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.500
911?
WE JUST WORKED
A 30-HOUR SHIFT.

02:03.533 --> 02:04.833
I DON'T HAVE ANY
CLEAN UNDERWEAR.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.400
THE VANCOUVER-BOUND TRAIN

02:06.433 --> 02:09.400
WAS CARRYING
OVER 300 PASSENGERS.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.300
LOOKS UGLY.
PARAMEDICS ARE ON THE SCENE
HELPING VICTIMS.

02:11.333 --> 02:14.300
YOU'RE LEAVING?
NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

02:14.333 --> 02:17.200
SORRY, GOTTA GO TEND
TO SOMEONE ELSE'S TRAIN WRECK.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.433
YOU GOTTA AT LEAST STAY
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.367
YOU'RE IN NO SHAPE
TO CUT PEOPLE OPEN.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.667
PLUS, I DON'T WANT
TO MISS THE ENDING.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.600
MEREDITH?

02:24.633 --> 02:26.800
MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST.
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

02:26.833 --> 02:30.600
THAT'S THE STUPIDEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.367
(Meredith)
IN GENERAL,

02:32.400 --> 02:35.767
PEOPLE CAN BE CATEGORIZED
IN ONE OF TWO WAYS--

02:35.800 --> 02:39.600
THOSE WHO LOVE SURPRISES

02:39.633 --> 02:42.100
AND THOSE WHO DON'T.

02:42.133 --> 02:43.333
I...

02:43.367 --> 02:46.600
DON'T.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.533
(Woman Reporter) A DAMAGED
ENGINE PART HAD BEEN

02:48.567 --> 02:51.600
IDENTIFIED TWO HOURS BEFORE
THE TRAIN LEFT THE STATION.

02:51.633 --> 02:53.800
BUT A DECISION WAS MADE
THAT THE TRAIN LEAVE ON TIME.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.333
DUDE,

02:55.367 --> 02:56.333
YOU'RE LATE.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.433
INVESTIGATORS
ARE STILL TRYING TO DETERMINE

02:58.467 --> 02:59.733
WHO MADE THAT DECISION
AND WHY.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.200
(pager beeps)

03:01.233 --> 03:04.367
I'VE NEVER MET A SURGEON
WHO ENJOYS A SURPRISE.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.367
BECAUSE, AS SURGEONS,
WE LIKE TO BE IN THE KNOW.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.300
WE HAVE TO BE IN THE KNOW.

03:09.333 --> 03:11.300
BECAUSE OFTEN,
WHEN WE AREN'T,

03:11.333 --> 03:13.233
PEOPLE DIE
AND LAWSUITS HAPPEN.

03:13.267 --> 03:16.567
AM I RAMBLING?
I THINK I'M RAMBLING.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.500
(telephone rings)

03:18.533 --> 03:21.333
I THINK I SAW A PNEUMOTHORAX.
I HOPE I GET A PNEUMOTHORAX.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.100
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
TALKING TO ME.

03:23.133 --> 03:27.067
I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A FRIEND, SO I'M RISING ABOVE.
AND WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

03:27.100 --> 03:28.667
BECAUSE YOU FREAKED OUT
IN THE ELEVATOR?

03:28.700 --> 03:31.133
I DIDN'T FREAK OUT.
AND MISSED YOUR CHANCE TO
PERFORM AN OPEN HEART SURGERY?

03:31.167 --> 03:33.067
O'MALLEY PLUGGED A HOLE
WITH HIS FINGER.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.833
I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.
WELL, I DON'T.

03:34.867 --> 03:37.067
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY
CARES ABOUT YOU.
THANKS FOR ASKING,
BUT I DON'T.

03:38.833 --> 03:42.367
WOW.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

03:42.400 --> 03:43.800
NOTHING.
OH, NOTHING.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.700
HEY, YOU,
GO GET ME MY DAMN SHOES.

03:45.733 --> 03:47.600
HERE.

03:47.633 --> 03:50.067
LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE.

03:51.067 --> 03:51.833
HELLO.

03:51.867 --> 03:54.133
I SEEM TO BE
A LITTLE BIT DRUNK.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.767
I WAS OFF DUTY.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.800
SO WAS I.
ANYBODY ELSE HALF IN THE BOTTLE?

03:57.833 --> 03:59.467
UH, NO.
NO.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.733
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

04:00.767 --> 04:02.733
GREY, JUST STAY OUT OF THE WAY.
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU LATER.

04:02.767 --> 04:04.667
THE REST OF YOU STICK WITH ME
AND WAIT FOR YOUR ASSIGNMENTS.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.533
I KNOW YOU GET ALL A-QUIVER AT
THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND ORGANS,

04:07.567 --> 04:09.133
BUT IT'S GONNA BE A LONG NIGHT
AND YOU'RE ALREADY TIRED.

04:09.167 --> 04:12.233
I DON'T WANT ANY MISTAKES.
COME ON NOW!

04:15.433 --> 04:18.067
(monitor beeps)

04:18.067 --> 04:20.233
I'M SO NOT TIRED ANYMORE.
ME NEITHER.
I'M NOT TIRED EITHER.

04:22.733 --> 04:25.167
WE'VE GOT A THIRD-TRIMESTER
BURN VICTIM HERE.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.667
DR. BAILEY, I'M GOING TO
NEED SOME HELP.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.567
UH, IZZIE, GO.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.233
YES!
HAVE A NICE NAP!

04:31.367 --> 04:33.133
HAVE YOU HAD
ANY CONTRACTIONS?
NO.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.900
OH, HEY,

04:36.933 --> 04:40.333
JOE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU THAT
McSTEAMY CAME LOOKING FOR YOU.
YOU MEAN McDREAMY.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.567
JOE SAID McDREAMY
CAME LOOKING FOR ME?

04:42.600 --> 04:45.533
NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
IT WAS McSTEAMY.

04:45.567 --> 04:46.500
YEAH.

04:46.533 --> 04:47.633
YEAH.

04:55.133 --> 04:57.100
(Woman) DR. SHEPHERD,
COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?

04:57.133 --> 05:01.067
DOES THAT MEAN
HE PICKED HER?

05:01.067 --> 05:02.800
IF IT DOES,
I JUST LOST 50 BUCKS.

05:02.833 --> 05:03.867
GOT THE LEG!

05:06.300 --> 05:09.567
I WANT THAT LEG!
HE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD
AT THE SCENE.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.300
PRESSURE DRESSINGS APPLIED,
TWO LARGE BORE IVs STARTED.
ANYTHING FOR PAIN?

05:13.333 --> 05:15.200
BASE ORDERED MORPHINE.
5 MIGS GIVEN SO FAR.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.133
DR. BAILEY,
WHO YOU GOT?

05:17.167 --> 05:19.200
OH!
OH!

05:19.233 --> 05:21.100
CRISTINA, GO.

05:21.133 --> 05:24.133
RULE OUT OTHER INJURIES
AND BOOK AN O.R.
YES, SIR.

05:24.167 --> 05:26.767
DR. WEBBER.
WE HAVE A TRAIN WRECK, DEREK.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.633
WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.
NOW CLEAR ME FOR SURGERY

05:28.667 --> 05:29.567
OR YOU'RE FIRED.
ANY HEADACHES TODAY?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.667
NO.
DIZZINESS?
NAUSEA? BLURRED VISION?

05:31.700 --> 05:35.567
NO, NO AND NO.
NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY.
FINE, BUT I'M COMING
WITH YOU.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.400
OR I'M FIRED.
UP TO YOU.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.833
WAS THAT A NOD?
YES.

05:46.867 --> 05:48.367
DO WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANT?
NO.

05:49.867 --> 05:52.100
AM I INVISIBLE?

05:52.133 --> 05:53.633
OKAY,
SO MY POINT ACTUALLY,

05:53.667 --> 05:56.400
AND I DO HAVE ONE,

05:56.433 --> 05:57.800
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH SURPRISES

05:57.833 --> 06:02.267
OR DEATH OR LAWSUITS
OR EVEN SURGEONS.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.100
MY POINT IS THIS--
WHOEVER SAID

06:03.133 --> 06:06.833
"WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
CAN'T HURT YOU,"

06:06.867 --> 06:09.067
WAS A COMPLETE
AND TOTAL MORON.

06:11.233 --> 06:13.767
NOT KNOWING IS
THE WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.367
OKAY, FINE.

06:23.400 --> 06:30.533
MAYBE IT'S THE SECOND WORST.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.067
HIS B.P.'s HOLDING STEADY
AT 90 OVER PALP.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.800
SHE'S HAD TWO HYPOTENSIVE
EPISODES TO THE LOW 70s.

06:41.833 --> 06:44.467
YOU COULDN'T GET
A SAW IN THERE?
NOT WITHOUT MOVING 'EM.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.333
WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN
A VERY BAD IDEA.

06:46.367 --> 06:49.233
DID YOU BOLUS
HER WITH FLUIDS?

06:49.267 --> 06:53.100
IS THIS THE CRAZIEST
THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN?

06:55.067 --> 06:57.067
UM, YEAH.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.733
YEAH.
ME TOO.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.500
OKAY, THEN, YOU GUYS
GOT IT FROM HERE.

07:08.533 --> 07:11.467
HEY, UH, YOU WERE
AT THE SCENE?

07:11.500 --> 07:13.400
YEAH. WON'T BE TOO BAD
FOR YOU.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.500
LOT OF CARNAGE.
NOT A LOT OF SURVIVORS.

07:16.533 --> 07:18.433
THEY'RE NEVER
GONNA FIT INTO C.T.

07:18.467 --> 07:20.300
WE'RE GONNA BE FLYING BLIND.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.800
GET X-RAYS AND LABS AND PAGE ME
THE MINUTE YOU'RE DONE.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.733
EXCUSE ME.

07:23.767 --> 07:26.567
HI, I'M DR. BURKE.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.800
YOU SHOULDN'T
TURN YOUR HEAD.

07:27.833 --> 07:30.367
YOU WANT TO TRY TO MOVE
AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.733
OH, OKAY.

07:32.767 --> 07:35.500
SO ARE YOU GONNA PULL THIS POLE
OUT OF US ANYTIME SOON?

07:35.533 --> 07:37.500
IT'S A TOUCH
UNCOMFORTABLE.

07:37.533 --> 07:39.533
I'M SORRY. WE CAN'T DO THAT
UNTIL WE GET A BETTER LOOK

07:39.567 --> 07:41.467
AT WHAT'S GOING ON INTERNALLY.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.067
BUT I ASSURE YOU, WE WILL WORK
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

07:44.100 --> 07:48.567
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A BREATH MINT?

07:50.633 --> 07:53.067
FOR ME.
NOT FOR YOU.

07:55.367 --> 07:57.233
GET THEM GOING.

07:57.267 --> 07:58.600
UH, O'MALLEY,
GET THEM TO X-RAY.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.700
THANKS.

08:00.733 --> 08:03.567
MOVE THEM EXTREMELY
CAREFULLY.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.467
THIS NEVER WOULD'VE HAPPENED
BEFORE THE ELEVATOR.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.400
YOU GO, GEORGE.

08:11.067 --> 08:14.433
ALEX, COVER THE E.R.
YOU CAN DO SUTURES

08:14.467 --> 08:18.300
WHILE YOU GET OVER
YOUR NEWFOUND FEAR OF SCALPELS.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.633
THAT WAS MEAN,
EVEN FOR YOU.

08:22.233 --> 08:25.600
YOU ARE DRUNK. GO GET YOURSELF
A BANANA BAG I.V.,

08:25.633 --> 08:27.133
PUT IT IN YOUR ARM
AND THEN FIND ME.

08:27.167 --> 08:29.267
DO NOT SPEAK
TO ANY MORE PATIENTS.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.667
DO NOT PRACTICE
ANY MEDICINE.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.600
WELL, SHOULD
I JUST GO HOME?

08:32.633 --> 08:34.667
WELL, UNLESS YOU DRANK
THE WHOLE LIQUOR BOTTLE,

08:34.700 --> 08:36.100
YOU'LL BE SOBER
IN A FEW HOURS.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.733
AND THE I.V. FLUIDS WILL
HEAD OFF YOUR HANGOVER.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.267
THEN YOU CAN ASSIST WITH
THE MANY MANGLED VICTIMS

08:41.300 --> 08:42.567
YOU SEE SPREAD OUT
BEFORE YOU.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.167
BESIDES, IF I'M NOT GOING HOME,
NOBODY'S GOING HOME.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.100
TEN YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

08:47.133 --> 08:49.100
I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO FINISH
MY DAMN LOBSTER.

08:50.233 --> 08:52.133
WELL, UM, IS THERE ANYONE
YOU'D LIKE ME TO CALL?

08:52.167 --> 08:54.067
NO, THEY CALLED MY WIFE
FROM THE AMBULANCE.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.567
AND MY FIANCé. THEY'RE FLYING
DOWN FROM VANCOUVER TOGETHER.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.800
NORMALLY AMANDA
WOULD BE A TAD UPSET

08:59.833 --> 09:01.467
TO FIND ME PRESSED UP
AGAINST ANOTHER WOMAN.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.800
BUT IN THIS CASE,
I THINK I'LL GET A PASS.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.533
YOU TWO WEREN'T
TRAVELING TOGETHER?

09:05.567 --> 09:07.267
NO, WE JUST MET.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.200
BIT OF AN AWKWARD
INTRODUCTION.

09:09.233 --> 09:10.533
YOU HAVE VERY NICE PORES.

09:10.567 --> 09:13.067
OH, IT HURTS TO LAUGH.

09:13.100 --> 09:16.200
HEY.
HEY.

09:16.233 --> 09:17.633
WHOA.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.600
YOU CAN GO AHEAD.
OH, THANKS.

09:20.567 --> 09:21.800
(clears throat)

09:21.833 --> 09:22.767
OH, WOW.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.333
DO YOU LIKE, UH,
I COULD--
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

09:25.367 --> 09:26.433
THANKS. COME ON.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.833
DR. STEVENS,
DID YOU NEED SOMETHING?

09:37.867 --> 09:39.433
NO.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.567
OW.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.733
OH, I'M SORRY.
AM I DOING THIS TOO--

09:44.767 --> 09:45.767
OW! OW!

09:45.800 --> 09:47.367
WAS THAT A...

09:47.400 --> 09:48.367
DID I HAVE...

09:48.400 --> 09:51.067
A CONTRACTION.
IT WAS DEFINITELY A CONTRACTION.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.300
WE NEED TO BOOK
AN O.R.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.333
LOOK, YOU ARE IN NO SHAPE
TO PUSH,

09:54.367 --> 09:56.267
AND THE BABY IS STILL
IN SOME DISTRESS.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.100
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
PROCEED WITH A C-SECTION.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.800
OKAY.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.133
OKAY, BUT CAN WE CALL
A LAWYER FIRST?

10:04.167 --> 10:06.200
I DON'T HAVE A WILL.

10:06.233 --> 10:10.067
AND THERE'S NO FATHER.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.333
AND IN CASE
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME...

10:12.367 --> 10:16.233
THERE'S NO CAUSE FOR PANIC,
BROOKE, WE HAVE SOME TIME, OKAY?

10:16.267 --> 10:18.233
OKAY.

10:18.267 --> 10:20.267
(cell phone rings)
HELLO.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.433
OH, NO, NO,
WE'RE FINE, HONEY.

10:22.467 --> 10:24.733
YEAH, SOME REDNECK TRIED
TO OUTRUN THE TRAIN.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.633
HONEY, THE TRAIN SLAMMED INTO
HIS ASS AND THEN IT ROLLED.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.167
DOES THAT HURT?
UNH-UNH.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.767
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
THAT DUDE IS TOAST.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.600
HONEY, HIM AND ABOUT
200 OTHER PEOPLE.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.333
AND MARY GOT HER FACE
ALL CUT UP.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.600
DOES IT HURT
ANYWHERE ELSE?
HERE.

10:37.633 --> 10:39.633
A WHOLE BUNCH OF LUGGAGE,
WHEN THEY HIT THE BRAKES,

10:39.667 --> 10:41.567
IT JUST CAME FLYING
AT US.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.500
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TAKE YOU FOR AN X-RAY,

10:43.533 --> 10:45.467
SEE IF ANYTHING'S BROKEN, IF
THERE'S ANY INTERNAL INJURIES.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.700
OKAY.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.633
YEAH, WAIT, WAIT,
YOU KNOW, HOLD ON.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.567
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CALL YOU BACK.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.500
HEY, HEY, HEY,
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.433
UM, WHERE YOU GOING?
I'M TAKING YOUR FRIEND
FOR AN X-RAY.

10:54.467 --> 10:55.667
NO OFFENSE, LITTLE BOY,

10:55.700 --> 10:57.433
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE
MY OLDEST SON.

10:57.467 --> 10:59.600
AND HE'S NOTHING
BUT TROUBLE.

10:59.633 --> 11:02.133
YVONNE, SHUT UP.
I SAID "NO OFFENSE."
I'M JUST SAYING.

11:02.167 --> 11:04.167
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE A DOCTOR?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.667
(cell phone rings)

11:07.433 --> 11:09.833
YEAH? OH, YEAH, YEAH,
WE FINE.

11:09.867 --> 11:12.300
YEAH, SOME REDNECK TRIED
TO OUTRUN THE TRAIN, RIGHT?

11:12.333 --> 11:15.267
OW.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.067
OW.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.067
OW.

11:19.067 --> 11:20.433
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:20.467 --> 11:22.667
TRYING TO INSERT
MY BANANA BAG,

11:22.700 --> 11:24.400
WHICH SOUNDS VAGUELY DIRTY,
BUT IT ISN'T.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.500
I CAN DO IT.

11:26.533 --> 11:30.333
SO HOW'S IT GOING
WITH ADDISON?

11:30.367 --> 11:32.767
BAD MOOD?
GOOD MOOD?

11:32.800 --> 11:35.167
YAY, MY HUSBAND
PICKED ME MOOD?

11:35.200 --> 11:37.100
UH, I THINK IT'S MORE

11:37.133 --> 11:40.467
OF A I HATE THE SMELL
OF CHARRED FLESH MOOD.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.667
BEFORE YOU JUDGE ME,

11:42.700 --> 11:44.667
I KNOW THERE WAS
A TRAIN ACCIDENT.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.233
PEOPLE ARE
VERY BADLY HURT.

11:47.267 --> 11:48.700
AND THAT I'M A VAPID
NARCISSIST

11:48.733 --> 11:51.200
WHEN YOU MIX ME
WITH ALCOHOL.

11:51.233 --> 11:53.533
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING,
I KNOW THAT.

11:53.567 --> 11:54.800
WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

11:54.833 --> 11:57.633
I TAKE ISSUE
WITH HER SALMON-COLORED SCRUBS.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.600
I MEAN, WHAT SELF-RESPECTING
SURGEON

11:59.633 --> 12:01.233
WEARS SALMON-COLORED SCRUBS?

12:01.267 --> 12:03.067
THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
YEAH.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.233
THANK YOU.

12:09.267 --> 12:11.567
YANG, HOW'S THAT WOUND LOOKING?

12:11.600 --> 12:14.100
PRETTY CLEAN.
SOME DIRT AND GRAVEL MOSTLY.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.333
THIS GUY WAS LUCKY.
IT'S A GUILLOTINE INJURY.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.733
IF WE DO THIS RIGHT...
HE'LL HAVE FULL USE
OF HIS LEG.

12:18.767 --> 12:21.200
(pager beeps)

12:21.233 --> 12:23.100
DR. SHEPHERD?

12:24.267 --> 12:27.400
IT'LL WAIT.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.333
I'M FINE, DEREK.
JUST ADJUSTING TO THE LIGHT.

12:29.367 --> 12:31.267
ALL I'M SAYING
IS THERE'S NO SHAME

12:31.300 --> 12:32.767
IN TAKING A LITTLE MORE
TIME OFF.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.300
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU OLD
OR TIRED OR RUSTY.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.067
YEAH, OKAY,
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.333
(pager beeps)

12:39.367 --> 12:41.267
YOU'RE THE ONLY ATTENDING
NEUROSURGEON.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.200
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NEEDED
ELSEWHERE, AND I'M FINE HERE.

12:43.233 --> 12:44.633
(pager beeps)

12:44.667 --> 12:46.767
PAGE ME
IF YOU NEED ME.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.467
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED
CLEANING THAT WOUND,

12:49.500 --> 12:52.067
YOU CAN HELP ME HERE,
DR. YANG.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.333
IS THE WOUND CLEAN, YANG?

12:58.367 --> 13:00.267
YES, SIR.
I-- BUT...

13:00.300 --> 13:02.167
BUT WHAT?

13:02.200 --> 13:04.367
IF YOUR PLAN IS TO BE
A WATCHDOG FOR DR. SHEPHERD,

13:04.400 --> 13:06.600
OR IF YOU THINK YOUR JOB HERE
IS TO BABYSIT ME,

13:06.633 --> 13:08.667
THEN YOU CAN THINK AGAIN.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.633
I'VE BEEN A SURGEON LONGER
THAN YOU'VE BEEN BREATHING.

13:10.667 --> 13:13.133
AND IF I WERE NOT READY
TO BE IN THIS O.R.,

13:13.167 --> 13:15.667
I WOULD SAY SO.
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
YES, SIR.

13:15.700 --> 13:19.300
NOW DO WE HAVE
A PROBLEM, YANG?
UH, YES.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.067
NO, SIR, I-I'M THRILLED
TO LEARN.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.067
AND I'M GRATEFUL
TO BE HERE. IT'S JUST...

13:24.100 --> 13:25.833
THAT...

13:25.867 --> 13:27.233
UM...

13:28.333 --> 13:30.233
SORRY.
HIS LEGS--

13:30.267 --> 13:31.633
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

13:33.267 --> 13:35.133
THEY'RE BOTH LEFT.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.267
FIND THE MAN'S LEG, YANG.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.400
FIND IT NOW.
YES, SIR.

13:43.433 --> 13:46.067
IS IT GOING
STRAIGHT THROUGH HER SPINE?

13:46.100 --> 13:49.467
IT IS.
T8's COMPLETELY CRUSHED.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.467
HEY.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.267
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:53.300 --> 13:55.633
UH, TEQUILA.

13:56.733 --> 13:59.400
I'M KEEPING AN EYE
ON HER.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.733
LOOK AT THIS.

14:02.767 --> 14:05.700
THESE PEOPLE
ARE STILL ALIVE?
THEY'RE STILL MAKING
SMALL TALK.

14:05.733 --> 14:08.100
THE POLE'S TAMPONADING
THE WOUND

14:08.133 --> 14:09.067
AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.767
IT'S HITTING THE AORTA.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.667
LOOK AT HIM. IT'S RIGHT IN LINE
WITH HIS INFERIOR VENA CAVA.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.300
IS THERE ANY WAY TO OPERATE
WITHOUT SEPARATING THEM?

14:17.333 --> 14:18.667
NO.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.667
IF WE REMOVE
THE POLE THEN...
THEY'LL BOTH
BLEED OUT.

14:23.567 --> 14:25.367
WHAT IF WE DON'T
MOVE THE POLE?

14:26.500 --> 14:28.400
WHAT IF WE MOVE ONE OF
THE PATIENTS OFF THE POLE

14:28.433 --> 14:30.367
TO GET THE SAW IN THERE?

14:30.400 --> 14:33.200
THEN WE CAN HOLD THE POLE
STEADY IN THE OTHER ONE.

14:33.233 --> 14:35.367
MOVE IT VERY SLOWLY

14:35.400 --> 14:37.333
AND REPAIR THE DAMAGE
AS WE GO.

14:37.367 --> 14:39.233
WHO?
WHICH WOULD YOU MOVE?

14:40.633 --> 14:42.467
WITH HER AORTIC INJURIES,

14:42.500 --> 14:44.433
HER CHANCES OF SURVIVAL
ARE EXTREMELY SLIM

14:44.467 --> 14:47.367
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.200
BUT IF WE MOVE HER,

14:49.233 --> 14:50.400
WE HAVE A REAL SHOT
AT SAVING HIM.

14:50.433 --> 14:53.133
WELL, I COULD ARGUE SINCE
HER INJURIES ARE MORE EXTENSIVE,

14:53.167 --> 14:54.333
WE SHOULD MOVE HIM.

14:54.367 --> 14:58.067
GIVE HER
THE BEST SHOT WE CAN.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.100
SO BASICALLY, WHOEVER YOU MOVE
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE?

15:04.833 --> 15:07.600
SO HOW DO YOU CHOOSE?

15:07.633 --> 15:10.367
HOW DO YOU DECIDE
WHO GETS TO LIVE?

15:16.600 --> 15:18.467
WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS CALL SOON
IF WE WANT A SHOT

15:18.500 --> 15:20.333
AT SAVING EITHER ONE
OF THEM.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.767
I'D LIKE TO EXAMINE THEM
BEFORE I WEIGH IN.
I'LL WAIT
FOR YOUR PAGE.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.767
DR. GREY--
DR. GREY NEEDS TO GET HERSELF
A BLOOD ALCOHOL TEST

15:25.800 --> 15:27.733
BEFORE PRACTICING
ANY MEDICINE TONIGHT.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.767
WHAT? NO, I'M TOTALLY FINE.
LOOK.

15:30.867 --> 15:34.333
TOTALLY FINE.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.567
RIGHT, OKAY.

15:38.133 --> 15:39.133
I'M FINE.

15:39.167 --> 15:42.333
REGRETTING THAT LAST SHOOTER
ABOUT NOW, AREN'T YOU?

15:44.333 --> 15:46.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

15:46.267 --> 15:48.667
UH, THE LEG YOU BROUGHT IN
WITH THE AMPUTEE--

15:48.700 --> 15:50.633
I DIDN'T BRING IN
AN AMPUTEE.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.667
OKAY, WELL, UM,
ONE OF YOU DID, AND IT'S, UM--

15:52.700 --> 15:54.833
BECAUSE ALL PARAMEDICS LOOK
ALIKE TO YOU, RIGHT, DOCTOR?

15:54.867 --> 15:59.367
OKAY, REALLY, I CANNOT STRADDLE
ANOTHER GIANT EGO RIGHT NOW.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.300
I'M ALREADY DOING
THE SPLITS,

16:01.333 --> 16:02.800
SO I NEED THE RIGHT LEG, RIGHT
NOW OR THE CHIEF OF SURGERY

16:02.833 --> 16:05.200
IS GOING TO TAKE AWAY
MY PRETTY BLUE SCRUBS.

16:05.233 --> 16:07.800
WHEN THE TRAIN DERAILED,
IT HIT AN OVERPASS.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.333
THE ROOF OF THE DINING CAR
WAS SHEERED OFF

16:09.367 --> 16:11.667
AND IT SLICED THROUGH
A PASSENGER CAR.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.700
THERE WERE MULTIPLE
DECAPITATIONS.

16:13.733 --> 16:16.633
YOUR GUY CAN LIVE
WITHOUT HIS LEG.

16:16.667 --> 16:19.400
THIS IS SO NOT ABOUT
THE LEG OR THE GUY.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.267
BUT THANK YOU.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.500
FOR ALL THAT YOU DO, REALLY.
THANKS.

16:28.267 --> 16:31.200
MM-HMM, YEAH.
OH, YEAH, HONEY, WE FINE.

16:31.233 --> 16:33.133
YEAH, BUT SOME REDNECK
TRIED TO OUTRUN THE TRAIN.

16:33.167 --> 16:35.433
THEN THEY GO AND GIVE US
THIS LITTLE BOY DOCTOR--

16:35.467 --> 16:38.567
ALL RIGHT,
THE SCAR SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.300
CAN YOU TELL ME,
MY FRIEND,

16:41.333 --> 16:43.233
SHE'S PREGNANT, TOO.

16:43.267 --> 16:44.767
SHE WAS PUT IN
A DIFFERENT AMBULANCE.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.567
SHE WAS BURNED.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.600
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE IS?

16:48.633 --> 16:51.200
IF SHE'S NOT DOWN HERE,
SHE SHOULD BE UP IN MATERNITY.

16:51.233 --> 16:53.400
OKAY, I NEED
TO SEE HER.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.533
WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET.
WE STILL HAVE TO DO A FULL EXAM.

16:55.567 --> 16:56.833
MY BABY'S FINE.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.767
I CAN FEEL HER KICKING.
I'VE GOTTA SEE BROOKE.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.367
UH, WAIT, YOU CAN'T JUST
LEAVE LIKE THAT.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.300
JUST WAIT.
COME HERE, COME HERE.

17:02.333 --> 17:04.600
OW. OW!

17:04.633 --> 17:06.500
SORRY.
YOU OPERATED ON A HEART
EARLIER, GEORGE.

17:06.533 --> 17:09.233
YOU'D THINK YOU COULD
DRAW A LITTLE BLOOD.

17:09.267 --> 17:11.100
I ROCKED THAT HEART.

17:11.133 --> 17:12.267
YEAH, YOU DID.

17:12.300 --> 17:17.100
I THINK I'M STRUNG OUT
ON THE SCALPEL.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.667
NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

17:21.867 --> 17:24.667
SO ANY NEWS ABOUT...

17:24.700 --> 17:27.467
NO.
I CAN'T READ HIM.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.167
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING

17:30.200 --> 17:32.200
YOU EVEN GAVE HIM
THE CHOICE.

17:32.233 --> 17:35.100
AND I THINK,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

17:35.133 --> 17:37.367
I THINK HE'S CRAZY
IF HE DOESN'T PICK YOU.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.767
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'VE SEEN
A RIGHT LEG.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.833
A CLEANLY SEVERED
RIGHT LEG?

17:42.867 --> 17:44.633
NO.

17:44.667 --> 17:47.133
HOW WEIRD
IS THIS JOB?

17:49.100 --> 17:50.067
WEIRD.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.733
BROOKE?

17:51.767 --> 17:54.267
JANA?

17:56.433 --> 17:58.433
THANK GOD.

17:58.467 --> 18:01.067
DR. KAREV?
SHE WAS ON THE TRAIN?
I COULDN'T STOP HER.
SHE WANTED TO SEE HER.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.700
YES.
HAVE YOU DONE
AN ULTRASOUND?

18:02.733 --> 18:03.867
CLEARED HER C-SPINE?

18:03.900 --> 18:07.067
IS THERE ANY REASON YOU
CAN THINK OF THAT THIS PATIENT

18:07.067 --> 18:08.767
SHOULD BE WANDERING AROUND
THE HOSPITAL UNATTENDED?

18:08.800 --> 18:11.533
SHE'S NOT UNATTENDED.
I CAME UP WITH HER.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.633
YOU CAN LEAVE NOW,

18:13.667 --> 18:16.433
DR. KAREV.

18:18.367 --> 18:20.500
IRRESPONSIBLE,
EVEN FOR AN INTERN.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.700
WHAT, YOU DISAGREE?

18:23.733 --> 18:26.067
SHE WANTED TO SEE HER FRIEND.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.833
I MEAN, WHAT WAS HE
SUPPOSED TO DO? TACKLE HER?

18:27.867 --> 18:31.400
DR. STEVENS, WHY DON'T YOU GET
OUR NEW PATIENT INTO A BED?

18:31.433 --> 18:33.600
SHALL WE?

18:35.733 --> 18:37.700
CAN YOU FEEL THAT,
MISS KRASNOFF?

18:37.733 --> 18:40.100
YOU'RE A CUTE DOCTOR.

18:40.133 --> 18:42.533
CUTE DOCTORS GET TO CALL ME
BY MY FIRST NAME.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.800
BONNIE.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.233
OKAY, BONNIE.

18:48.267 --> 18:49.833
CAN YOU FEEL THAT,
BONNIE?

18:49.867 --> 18:51.167
CAN I FEEL WHAT?

18:51.200 --> 18:53.833
OH. OH, WELL,
I GUESS THAT'S A NO.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.600
EXCUSE ME,
DR. SHEPHERD?
YES?

18:56.633 --> 18:57.833
I GOT THE LABS.

18:57.867 --> 19:00.400
OH, GREAT.
THANK YOU.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.233
HOLD THAT, PLEASE.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.667
COULD YOU TRY TO WIGGLE
YOUR TOES, MR. MAYNARD?

19:05.633 --> 19:07.300
ARE THEY MOVING?

19:07.333 --> 19:08.733
YES, THEY ARE.

19:08.767 --> 19:10.833
GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

19:10.867 --> 19:12.333
YES, IT IS.
YES, IT IS.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.667
WHAT ABOUT ME?
ARE MINE MOVING?

19:17.500 --> 19:18.633
YES, THEY ARE.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.100
YAY ME!

19:22.733 --> 19:25.567
DR. SHEPHERD, IS IT?
YES, IT IS.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.633
DR. SHEPHERD,

19:27.667 --> 19:31.067
BONNIE AND I...

19:31.100 --> 19:32.833
ARE WE GONNA LIVE
THROUGH THIS?

19:32.867 --> 19:35.067
NOW THAT'S JUST MOROSE, TOM.

19:35.067 --> 19:37.567
I'M SORRY, DEAR.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.133
DOCTOR?

19:39.167 --> 19:43.467
WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN, MR. MAYNARD.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.100
ABOUT TIME, YANG.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.300
I WAS STARTING TO THINK
MY WORK HERE WOULD BE WASTED.

19:53.333 --> 19:56.200
I'M SO SORRY.
IT WASN'T EASY TO FIND.

19:56.233 --> 19:57.833
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF CHECKING THE WOUND,

19:57.867 --> 19:59.833
AND IT'S A VERY CLEAN-CUT,
WELL-PRESERVED.

19:59.867 --> 20:02.067
UH, DR. WEBBER?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.733
SIR?

20:09.767 --> 20:12.633
NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT THAT LEG?

20:12.667 --> 20:14.367
ANYTHING OTHER THAN
THAT VERY CLEAN CUT?

20:14.400 --> 20:17.100
DID YOU HAPPEN TO NOTICE,
FOR EXAMPLE,

20:17.133 --> 20:18.633
THAT IT WAS SHAVED
RECENTLY?

20:18.667 --> 20:20.100
AND MANICURED?

20:20.133 --> 20:23.067
TAKE A LOOK AT MY PATIENT,
DR. YANG.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.067
DOES HE LOOK LIKE
A MAN WHO WOKE UP

20:25.100 --> 20:28.100
AND SHAVED ONE OF HIS LEGS
THIS MORNING?

20:28.133 --> 20:29.633
NO.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.567
I'LL GO FIND
THE, UM, RIGHT--

20:31.600 --> 20:33.567
THE RIGHT RIGHT--
THE RIGHT RIGHT--

20:33.600 --> 20:35.100
THANK YOU.

20:42.333 --> 20:43.233
WHERE ARE WE?

20:43.267 --> 20:45.100
YOU WERE RIGHT.
HER VITALS ARE ERRATIC.

20:45.133 --> 20:47.367
PULSE IS WEAK.
SPINE'S SEVERED.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.833
I WAS HOPING
IT DIDN'T HIT THE--

20:48.867 --> 20:50.200
BUT FROM THAT ANGLE,

20:50.233 --> 20:51.733
IT CAN'T HAVE
MISSED THE AORTA.

20:51.767 --> 20:54.333
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
THINK HE CAN LIVE?

20:54.367 --> 20:56.467
HE'S GOT BETTER ODDS.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.333
ALL RIGHT, LET O.R. ONE
KNOW WE'RE COMING.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.567
AND, O'MALLEY?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.200
CLOSE OFF THE GALLERY.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.167
WE DON'T NEED
AN AUDIENCE FOR THIS.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.367
SHE'S CRACKING JOKES.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.700
HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE SHE'S
GONNA BE DEAD IN A FEW MINUTES

21:11.733 --> 21:13.700
WHEN SHE'S SITTING UP
CRACKING JOKES?

21:19.767 --> 21:20.633
EXCUSE ME.

21:20.667 --> 21:23.133
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE

21:23.167 --> 21:25.300
SOMETIME THIS YEAR?
WELL,
THE LAB'S BACKED UP,

21:25.333 --> 21:26.533
AND SO IS RADIOLOGY.
I CAN'T DISCHARGE YOUR FRIEND

21:26.567 --> 21:29.533
UNTIL I'M CERTAIN SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY INTERNAL INJURIES.

21:29.567 --> 21:32.200
(cell phone rings)

21:32.233 --> 21:34.800
HELLO?
YEAH, WE'RE STILL HERE.

21:34.833 --> 21:36.167
'CAUSE OUR DOCTOR'S
FRIGGIN' USELESS.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.733
MM-HMM. YEAH.

21:39.767 --> 21:42.433
I REALIZE YOU'RE DEALING
WITH A LOT OF CARNAGE.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.400
I'M ASKING IF YOU COULD
MAYBE SIFT THROUGH

21:45.433 --> 21:47.500
SOME OF THAT CARNAGE
AND FIND--

21:47.533 --> 21:50.267
HELLO?
DAMN IT.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.067
CRISTINA,
YOU PAGED ME?

21:52.067 --> 21:53.800
IF I DON'T
FIND THIS LEG,

21:53.833 --> 21:55.700
THE CHIEF IS GOING TO
CUT ME FROM THIS PROGRAM.

21:55.733 --> 21:57.633
AND I CANNOT
GO BACK HOME, BURKE.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.733
IT IS TOO SUNNY IN LOS ANGELES.
IT'S SUNNY EVERY DAY.

22:00.733 --> 22:02.633
AND YOU PAGED ME BECAUSE?

22:02.667 --> 22:04.767
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
FIND THE LEG!

22:04.800 --> 22:06.367
MMM.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.767
I CHECKED THE BOARD.
YOU'RE NOT IN A SURGERY, RIGHT?

22:08.800 --> 22:10.367
NO.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.500
YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND!
I MEAN...

22:13.533 --> 22:15.433
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
MUCH EXPERIENCE

22:15.467 --> 22:16.833
WITH THIS KIND OF THING BUT...

22:16.867 --> 22:19.067
AREN'T BOYFRIENDS
SUPPOSED TO HELP

22:19.067 --> 22:21.133
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS?

22:21.167 --> 22:23.733
CRISTINA, WHEN WE'RE ON DUTY,
I CAN'T BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

22:23.767 --> 22:24.700
OKAY?

22:24.733 --> 22:26.633
OKAY, SO, UH,
WHEN WE'RE ON DUTY,

22:26.667 --> 22:29.400
I CAN HAVE SEX
WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

22:31.433 --> 22:34.233
DR. YANG,
I'M WALKING AWAY NOW.

22:34.267 --> 22:36.200
FINE. FINE.

22:36.233 --> 22:40.067
BUT WHEN THE CHIEF CUTS ME,
YOU MIGHT RETHINK THIS.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.233
ADDISON YELLED AT YOU
IN FRONT OF A PATIENT?

22:42.267 --> 22:43.800
SHE DIDN'T
EXACTLY YELL.

22:46.233 --> 22:48.100
FINE,
SHE'S SATAN'S WHORE.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.067
THANK YOU.
SO DID YOU YELL BACK?

22:50.067 --> 22:51.267
NO.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.367
DUDE, YOU LOST
YOUR MOJO.
EXCUSE YOU?

22:54.400 --> 22:56.300
I WAS TRYING TO TALK BOY.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.233
O'MALLEY PLUGS A HOLE
WITH HIS FINGER

22:58.267 --> 23:00.833
AND EVERYONE WALKS AROUND
LIKE HE'S SOME KIND OF HERO.

23:00.867 --> 23:03.100
I HAVE ONE OFF DAY--
YOU CHICKENED OUT.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.633
I HESITATED BRIEFLY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU KISS IZZIE?

23:05.667 --> 23:07.267
AND NOW I'M LEAVING.

23:07.300 --> 23:08.633
IT'S NOT IN THE MORGUE.

23:08.667 --> 23:10.567
I'VE LOOKED IN THE AMBULANCES,
IN THE E.R.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.600
HOW IS ONE BLOODY, HAIRY LEG
GOING TO DESTROY MY CAREER?

23:15.467 --> 23:17.167
DR. KAREV?

23:20.100 --> 23:21.833
I HOPE YOU FIND
YOUR MOJO, ALEX.

23:21.867 --> 23:24.233
I FIND YOU DISTURBING
WITHOUT IT.
ME TOO.

23:24.267 --> 23:26.067
OW.

23:27.767 --> 23:30.833
THIS IS HARD
BECAUSE YOUR BODY

23:30.867 --> 23:34.367
IS IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF SHOCK.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.300
IT'S PREVENTING YOU
FROM FEELING PAIN,

23:36.333 --> 23:37.700
FROM FEELING THE EXTENT

23:37.733 --> 23:39.800
OF YOUR INJURIES.

23:39.833 --> 23:41.300
DR. SHEPHERD?

23:41.333 --> 23:43.267
WE HAVE A METAL POLE
CUTTING A PATH

23:43.300 --> 23:45.300
THROUGH OUR INSIDES.

23:45.333 --> 23:47.233
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TOM HERE,

23:47.267 --> 23:49.433
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT

23:49.467 --> 23:52.533
TO WALK OUT OF HERE
ANYTIME SOON SO...

23:52.567 --> 23:54.133
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU HAVE TO SAY,

23:54.167 --> 23:57.433
JUST PLEASE SAY IT.

23:57.467 --> 23:58.667
OKAY, BONNIE.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.300
IN ORDER TO OPERATE
ON MR. MAYNARD,

24:03.333 --> 24:06.200
WE HAVE TO
SEPARATE YOU TWO.

24:06.233 --> 24:08.800
IN ORDER TO DO THAT,

24:08.833 --> 24:11.833
WE HAVE TO MOVE YOU
BACKWARDS OFF THE POLE.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.700
CAN'T YOU JUST PULL THE POLE
OUT OF BOTH OF US?

24:14.733 --> 24:16.533
WELL, IF WE DID THAT,

24:16.567 --> 24:18.600
YOU WOULD BOTH START BLEEDING
VERY QUICKLY. TOO QUICKLY.

24:18.633 --> 24:22.400
RIGHT NOW THE POLE
IS PLUGGING THE WOUNDS.

24:22.433 --> 24:23.600
ONCE REMOVED,

24:23.633 --> 24:26.200
THE ORGANS WILL SHIFT.

24:26.233 --> 24:30.600
AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL
OF DAMAGE.

24:30.633 --> 24:33.767
SO IF YOU MOVE ME...

24:33.800 --> 24:35.767
I'LL DIE?

24:39.567 --> 24:42.067
WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO...

24:42.100 --> 24:44.367
NO. NO.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.700
IF ANYBODY HAS TO GO,

24:45.733 --> 24:47.567
IT SHOULD BE ME.
YOU JUST MOVE--

24:47.600 --> 24:50.467
MR. MAYNARD,
MR. MAYNARD,

24:50.500 --> 24:53.367
YOUR INJURIES
ARE LESS EXTENSIVE.

24:55.567 --> 24:58.300
IF WE PULL THE POLE FROM YOU
AS WE OPERATE AROUND IT,

24:58.333 --> 25:01.700
WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
AT REPAIRING THE DAMAGE.

25:04.733 --> 25:07.467
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.600
IT'S NOT FAIR.

25:10.633 --> 25:12.633
TOM...

25:12.667 --> 25:15.433
IT'S NOT FAIR EITHER WAY.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.733
IS, UM...

25:21.767 --> 25:24.567
IS MY DANNY--
IS HE HERE YET?

25:24.600 --> 25:25.600
THERE ARE DELAYS
AT THE AIRPORT.

25:25.633 --> 25:26.833
UM, THE STORM...

25:26.867 --> 25:31.267
WE COULD WAIT,
BUT THE LONGER WE DO,

25:31.300 --> 25:33.467
THE HIGHER THE RISK
OF INFECTION FOR--

25:33.500 --> 25:35.400
NO. NO.

25:35.433 --> 25:37.533
THIS IS BETTER.

25:37.567 --> 25:40.400
DANNY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

25:42.100 --> 25:46.700
I'VE HAD A COUPLE OF HOURS TO,
YOU KNOW, PROCESS ALL OF THIS.

25:46.733 --> 25:53.500
BUT IF HE HAD TO SEE ME,
TALK TO ME LIKE THIS, I...

25:53.533 --> 25:57.533
WELL, I JUST THINK
IT WOULD BE TOO HARD.

26:14.867 --> 26:18.200
RIGHT THERE--IN BETWEEN
THE VERTEBRAL SPACES.

26:18.233 --> 26:19.567
DON'T BE SHY ABOUT PRESSURE.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.567
THAT'S GOOD.
YOU ARE DOING SO GOOD.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.467
SOMEBODY CALLED
FOR A NOTARY?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.467
I ASKED FOR A LAWYER.

26:26.500 --> 26:28.400
I COULDN'T GET ONE
AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT,

26:28.433 --> 26:30.133
BUT THE HOSPITAL
HAS PRETTY STANDARD FORMS.

26:30.167 --> 26:32.067
IT JUST SAYS THAT
IN THE CASE OF DEATH

26:32.100 --> 26:33.833
OR PERMANENT VEGETATIVE STATE,

26:33.867 --> 26:35.667
THAT YOUR CHILD WILL REMAIN
IN THE CUSTODY OF,

26:35.700 --> 26:37.600
AND THEN WE'LL
PUT HER NAME IN.

26:37.633 --> 26:40.267
WAIT, WHAT?
WHAT ARE WE? WHO'S DYING HERE?

26:40.300 --> 26:42.467
THERE'S SOME DANGER.
WITH ANY SURGERY THERE'S DANGER.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.567
BUT WITH THE TRAUMA
OF BROOKE'S BURNS,

26:44.600 --> 26:46.433
THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL RISK
OF SHOCK.

26:46.467 --> 26:50.067
SHE JUST WANTS
TO BE CERTAIN.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.767
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE,
DO YOU HEAR ME?
I HEAR YOU.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.800
BUT WE STILL HAVE TO
SIGN THE FORMS.

26:53.833 --> 26:55.700
UNLESS YOU WANT OUR SON
TO END UP WITH MY MOM.

27:00.433 --> 27:03.300
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN TOGETHER?

27:03.333 --> 27:05.233
SINCE THIRD GRADE.

27:06.567 --> 27:08.600
WE'RE NOT LOVERS.
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

27:08.633 --> 27:10.800
WE JUST WANTED OUR KIDS
TO HAVE TWO PARENTS.

27:10.833 --> 27:13.067
SO WE GOT A SPERM DONOR.

27:13.067 --> 27:16.400
THE SAME DONOR? SO YOUR BABIES
ARE BROTHER AND SISTER?

27:16.433 --> 27:18.133
OH, HOW COOL IS THAT?

27:18.167 --> 27:19.700
THAT'S--
WOW.

27:19.733 --> 27:21.200
WET.
WHAT?

27:21.233 --> 27:22.667
I'M WET.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.467
OH, GOD.
I THINK MY WATER JUST BROKE.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.333
GOOD NEWS.

27:28.367 --> 27:29.700
YOU'VE GOT A BROKEN RIB.

27:29.733 --> 27:31.633
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU SOME
PAINKILLERS AND, UH...

27:31.667 --> 27:33.133
(cell phone rings)

27:33.167 --> 27:35.067
AFTER THAT, YOU SHOULD
BE GOOD TO GO.
THANK YOU.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.300
(ringing continues)

27:36.333 --> 27:37.833
YVONNE, ANSWER YOUR PHONE.

27:37.867 --> 27:39.100
(ringing continues)

27:39.133 --> 27:42.533
YVONNE? YVONNE?

27:42.567 --> 27:44.067
YVONNE?!

27:44.100 --> 27:46.067
CODE BLUE,
I NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE!

27:46.100 --> 27:47.400
YVONNE?!

27:50.633 --> 27:51.467
PUSH ONE OF EPI.
HOLD C.P.R.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.367
HER ABDOMEN'S DISTENDED.
IT'S ROCK SOLID.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.267
SHE'S LOST TOO MUCH BLOOD.
SHE'S BEEN BLEEDING FOR HOURS.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.100
BUT THERE'S NO BLOOD.
SHE'S NOT BLEEDING.

27:58.133 --> 28:00.200
SHE WAS BLEEDING
INTERNALLY.

28:00.233 --> 28:02.100
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
SHE WASN'T...

28:02.133 --> 28:03.333
SHE WASN'T EVEN
A PATIENT.

28:03.367 --> 28:05.100
I DIDN'T KNOW.

28:06.567 --> 28:08.133
DR. KAREV,
SHE'S GONE.

28:08.167 --> 28:09.533
NO! NO! NO!

28:12.600 --> 28:14.633
NO! NO! NO!
YVONNE!

28:14.667 --> 28:17.100
I'M SORRY.

28:18.433 --> 28:20.533
TIME OF DEATH--2:51.

28:20.567 --> 28:22.200
NO! NO! NO!

28:22.233 --> 28:24.200
NO! NO! NO!

28:24.233 --> 28:26.733
TRY AGAIN.
TRY AGAIN.

28:32.867 --> 28:34.667
JANA, THIS IS OUR O.B. RESIDENT
DR. HOFFMAN.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.600
SHE'S GONNA BE TAKING CARE
OF YOU FROM HERE.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.533
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, JANA.
JUST KEEP BREATHING.

28:39.567 --> 28:41.467
I'M GONNA CHECK
YOUR CERVIX NOW.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.367
BROOKE,
WE'VE BOOKED AN O.R.,

28:43.400 --> 28:45.200
BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA HOLD IT
FOR LONG SO WE NEED TO GO NOW.

28:45.233 --> 28:46.800
RIGHT NOW?

28:46.833 --> 28:49.300
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE TOGETHER. WE TOOK CLASSES.

28:49.333 --> 28:51.500
I'M SORRY,
BUT WE CAN'T WAIT.

28:51.533 --> 28:54.467
THAT'S OKAY, BROOKIE.
YOU GO HAVE YOUR C-SECTION

28:54.500 --> 28:55.733
AND ENJOY THOSE DRUGS.

28:55.767 --> 28:57.700
THIS IS ALREADY NOT FUN
FOR MY VAGINA.

28:57.733 --> 28:58.567
DR. STEVENS.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.233
NO.

29:00.267 --> 29:02.167
IF I HAVE TO GO,
SHE HAS TO STAY.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.467
SOMEONE HAS TO STAY
WITH JANA, PLEASE?

29:04.500 --> 29:06.367
BROOKE, DR. STEVENS
IS A SURGEON,

29:06.400 --> 29:08.767
BUT I'M GONNA FIND
YOU SOME--
IT'S OKAY.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.100
I'LL STAY.

29:11.133 --> 29:13.067
OKAY.

29:17.167 --> 29:18.100
BROOKIE,

29:18.133 --> 29:21.333
YOU STAY ALIVE, OKAY?

29:21.367 --> 29:22.533
YOU TOO.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.367
DAMN IT!

29:31.400 --> 29:33.067
HEY, DOC?

29:33.100 --> 29:34.067
WHAT?!

29:34.067 --> 29:35.233
EASY, KILLER.

29:35.267 --> 29:38.667
JILL SAID YOU GUYS WERE FREAKING
OUT LOOKING FOR THIS LEG.

29:39.767 --> 29:41.100
THANK YOU.

29:42.133 --> 29:43.767
RIGHT ON.

29:46.767 --> 29:49.533
CHIEF WEBBER,
I'M EXTREMELY SORRY. I...

29:49.567 --> 29:52.133
PULL THAT TENDON DOWN
WITH THOSE PICK-UPS.

29:52.167 --> 29:54.067
OH, YOU FOUND THE LEG?

29:54.100 --> 29:55.633
I FOUND THE LEG.

29:55.667 --> 29:57.333
YOU MISSED OUT
ON THIS ONE, YANG.

29:57.367 --> 29:59.300
BUT I'M SURE THEY COULD
USE A HAND DOWN IN THE E.R.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.633
KAREV AND I CAN HANDLE IT
FROM HERE.

30:13.533 --> 30:16.300
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

30:16.333 --> 30:19.267
MM-HMM.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.600
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN HEAVEN?

30:23.833 --> 30:27.133
I DO.

30:27.167 --> 30:29.467
DON'T YOU?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.367
I WANT TO.

30:39.233 --> 30:42.400
BONNIE...

30:42.433 --> 30:44.267
I JUST WANT TO SAY...

30:44.300 --> 30:45.733
SHH.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.133
I KNOW.

30:50.167 --> 30:53.600
I KNOW.

30:59.833 --> 31:02.133
THIS IS DR. ADAMS--

31:02.167 --> 31:04.067
OUR ANESTHESIOLOGIST.

31:04.100 --> 31:06.067
WHEN YOU'RE READY,

31:06.100 --> 31:07.533
HE'S GONNA PUT YOU
TO SLEEP.

31:07.567 --> 31:10.167
SO IT'S NOT
GONNA HURT?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.700
IT WON'T HURT
A BIT.

31:12.733 --> 31:13.800
GOOD.
YEAH.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.500
THAT'S GOOD.

31:17.533 --> 31:19.433
DR. SHEPHERD?

31:19.467 --> 31:21.367
YES.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.733
YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE
TO TALK TO MY DANNY, RIGHT?

31:24.767 --> 31:27.333
YES.

31:27.367 --> 31:30.533
OKAY.

31:30.567 --> 31:32.100
OKAY.

31:34.633 --> 31:36.667
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO TELL HIM?

31:42.600 --> 31:45.367
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE WE'RE ABOUT
TO KILL THIS GIRL?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.267
DR. BAILEY?

31:47.300 --> 31:49.133
MY LABS ARE IN.
SOBER?

31:49.167 --> 31:50.200
CAN I SCRUB IN?

31:50.233 --> 31:52.633
DO IT FAST.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.267
GEORGE.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.133
HEY.

32:17.167 --> 32:18.800
HI.

32:26.733 --> 32:28.567
YOU KNOW,
I, UH, I WENT TO THE BAR.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.600
I HEARD.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.767
DID YOU TAKE SOME ASPIRIN
WITH THE BANANA BAG?

32:44.800 --> 32:48.067
HELPS WITH THE HANGOVER.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.300
OH.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.767
YOU'RE STAYING
WITH HER.

33:09.067 --> 33:10.600
YEAH, SHE'S MY WIFE.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.367
(Bailey) DR. SHEPHERD,
SHE'S CRASHING.

33:20.433 --> 33:21.367
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.667
(monitor beeps)

33:22.700 --> 33:24.767
I JUST PUT THEM UNDER.
THE POLE MUST'VE SHIFTED.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.800
I BARELY TOUCHED HER.
THIS ISN'T MY FAULT.
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

33:26.833 --> 33:30.067
WE NEED TO REMOVE HER NOW IF
WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANY CHANCE.

33:30.067 --> 33:31.800
HOW DO WE DO THIS?
TEAM ONE, CONTINUE TO STABILIZE
HIS BODY.

33:31.833 --> 33:33.800
TEAM TWO, MOVE HER BACK.
LET'S GET THE SAW IN THERE.

33:33.833 --> 33:36.433
THIS HAS TO BE
FAST AND SMOOTH, PEOPLE.

33:36.467 --> 33:38.300
O'MALLEY, YOU HOLD
THE POLE IN PLACE.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.233
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T PULL ON IT.

33:40.267 --> 33:41.400
DON'T LET IT MOVE.
OKAY.

33:41.433 --> 33:43.433
ON THE COUNT OF THREE.

33:43.467 --> 33:45.733
ONE... TWO...

33:45.767 --> 33:48.100
THREE!
THAT'S GREAT!

33:48.133 --> 33:50.067
THAT'S GREAT.
TAKE ANOTHER BREATH.

33:50.067 --> 33:51.767
ONE... TWO...

33:51.800 --> 33:54.467
HE'S WEDGED UP
UNDER HER RIBS.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.400
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PULL HIM OUT. ON THREE.

33:56.433 --> 33:58.500
ONE... TWO...

34:02.100 --> 34:04.067
(monitor beeps)

34:15.433 --> 34:16.667
(monitor beeps)

34:16.700 --> 34:19.100
HE'S STABLE FOR NOW. LET'S START
WITH HER AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.

34:22.167 --> 34:23.200
SCALPEL.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.067
UH, GREY?
UH, GET IN HERE

34:27.067 --> 34:28.433
AND HELP RETRACT.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.500
DOCTOR.

34:29.533 --> 34:30.500
RETRACTOR.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.300
I'M IN.

34:47.767 --> 34:49.633
HER AORTA'S SHREDDED.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.600
THERE'S TOO MUCH DAMAGE HERE.
WE HAVE NO RHYTHM.

34:51.633 --> 34:53.400
(monitor flatlines)

34:53.433 --> 34:55.833
DOCTORS,
HE'S LOSING PRESSURE.

34:55.867 --> 34:57.433
HE'S BLEEDING.

35:02.133 --> 35:04.400
WHAT ABOUT HER?
WE CAN'T JUST ABANDON HER!

35:04.433 --> 35:06.267
COME ON, COME ON.

35:06.300 --> 35:07.800
WE CAN'T JUST
ABANDON HER!

35:07.833 --> 35:10.333
I'M GOING IN STEM TO STERN.
SCALPEL.

35:13.267 --> 35:14.667
STERNAL SAW.

35:19.700 --> 35:20.633
MEREDITH.

35:20.667 --> 35:23.367
(Bailey)
DR. GREY?

35:23.400 --> 35:24.333
(George)
MEREDITH?

35:24.367 --> 35:26.300
WHAT ABOUT HER?
WE CANNOT JUST ABANDON HER.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.067
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION!

35:31.833 --> 35:33.533
MEREDITH, COME ON.
THERE WAS TOO MUCH DAMAGE.

35:33.567 --> 35:35.633
THERE WAS NEVER
ANYTHING WE COULD DO.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.633
WE HAVE TO
LET HER GO.

35:38.833 --> 35:40.700
TIME OF DEATH--

35:40.733 --> 35:42.500
3:49.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.767
GOOD MORNING.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.333
HOW'S BROOKE?

36:11.367 --> 36:13.400
SHE'S GOOD.
AND THE BABY?

36:13.433 --> 36:16.300
HE CAME THROUGH,
TOO.

36:16.333 --> 36:18.467
SO HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION YET,
DR. STEVENS?

36:18.500 --> 36:20.100
I'M SORRY?

36:20.133 --> 36:22.700
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU'RE GOING TO HATE ME.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.200
YOU'RE MEREDITH'S FRIEND.
I'M THE WICKED WITCH

36:26.233 --> 36:28.833
WHO CAME IN AND RUINED HER LIFE
AND CHEATED ON DOCTOR...

36:28.867 --> 36:30.800
WAIT, WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU GUYS CALL HIM?

36:30.833 --> 36:33.067
McDREAMY.

36:33.067 --> 36:34.267
RIGHT.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.233
GOD, DOESN'T THAT
EMBARRASS HIM?

36:36.267 --> 36:39.267
YEAH,
I THINK IT DOES.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.300
YEAH, WELL, BY ALL RIGHTS,
YOU SHOULD HATE ME.

36:41.333 --> 36:42.367
I GUESS.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.767
EXCEPT THAT I'M GONNA BE
STAYING IN TOWN FOR AWHILE.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.667
YOU ARE?
YES.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.167
AND YOU SHOW A REAL GIFT
WITH MY SPECIALTY.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.600
I'VE GOT A LOT TO TEACH,
IF YOU WANT TO LEARN.

36:53.633 --> 36:55.667
SO?

36:55.700 --> 36:57.300
SO?

36:57.333 --> 37:01.600
SO WHEN YOU DECIDE
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

37:01.633 --> 37:04.533
FOR YOU TO HATE ME,
LET ME KNOW.

37:04.567 --> 37:07.267
(telephone rings)

37:07.300 --> 37:09.333
(ring)

37:15.133 --> 37:17.800
DID SHE, UH...

37:17.833 --> 37:20.233
DID SHE SUFFER?

37:20.267 --> 37:26.567
NO. HER INJURIES PREVENTED
HER FROM...

37:26.600 --> 37:28.467
NO, SHE WASN'T IN ANY PAIN.

37:30.167 --> 37:31.367
GOOD.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.167
THAT'S...

37:37.567 --> 37:39.767
SHE ASKED ME TO--

37:39.800 --> 37:41.733
TO TELL YOU THAT...

37:44.333 --> 37:47.100
SHE WANTED YOU TO KNOW,

37:47.133 --> 37:50.400
THAT IF LOVE WERE ENOUGH...

37:50.433 --> 37:52.333
THAT IF LOVE WERE ENOUGH,

37:52.367 --> 37:56.067
THAT SHE'D STILL BE HERE
WITH YOU.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.400
AS SURGEONS...

38:18.300 --> 38:21.200
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
WE HAVE TO KNOW.

38:21.233 --> 38:22.733
FINE WORK,
DR. KAREV.

38:22.767 --> 38:24.633
THANK YOU, SIR.

38:24.667 --> 38:28.500
WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES.

38:37.767 --> 38:40.300
HERE'S MOMMY.
HERE'S MOMMY.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.800
WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO
TAKE CARE OF OUR PATIENTS.

38:42.833 --> 38:46.500
TOM IS DOING
JUST FINE.

38:48.867 --> 38:51.267
(elevator dings)

38:59.533 --> 39:01.700
AND HOW TO TAKE CARE
OF EACH OTHER.

39:01.733 --> 39:03.367
(alarm rings)

39:21.333 --> 39:22.267
OKAY?

39:22.300 --> 39:23.233
YEAH.

39:23.267 --> 39:25.800
(alarm stops)

39:39.367 --> 39:40.667
EVENTUALLY...

39:40.700 --> 39:44.367
WE EVEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

39:44.400 --> 39:47.233
HOW TO TAKE CARE
OF OURSELVES.

39:52.300 --> 39:53.800
AS SURGEONS,

39:53.833 --> 39:55.500
WE HAVE TO BE IN THE KNOW.

40:00.533 --> 40:02.700
BUT AS HUMAN BEINGS,

40:02.733 --> 40:05.500
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER
TO STAY IN THE DARK.

40:09.533 --> 40:12.333
BECAUSE...

40:12.367 --> 40:15.133
IN THE DARK
THERE MAY BE FEAR...

40:20.800 --> 40:22.300
BUT THERE'S ALSO HOPE.

40:31.267 --> 40:33.467
YOU BETTER GET
CLEANED UP.

40:33.500 --> 40:36.267
ROUNDS IN FIVE MINUTES.
