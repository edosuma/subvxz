00:23.123 --> 00:25.717
I see you've had extensive
plastic surgery before.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.359
Any particular reason? My face
became too popular with the cops.

00:30.897 --> 00:33.661
Welcome to Napa, KITT,
where wine is king.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.629
I was hoping you might have seen
something. I mean, anything...

00:36.703 --> 00:39.604
The only thing I remember about this
morning is that I was scared to death.

00:39.672 --> 00:40.764
I want those diamonds.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.503
It's very good. Now, how about
a glass of Chateauneuf du Pape?

00:44.577 --> 00:45.601
What?
You heard me.

00:45.678 --> 00:48.306
Hey, what are you doing in Napa?
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.178
It's a longer jump
than you think, Michael.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.184
You had to tell me that, huh?

01:05.165 --> 01:07.633
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:07.700 --> 01:10.168
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:10.236 --> 01:12.204
who does not exist.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.081
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.148 --> 01:24.639
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.717 --> 01:26.776
the helpless, the powerless...

01:26.853 --> 01:30.050
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.112
Between you and me, Bonnie...

02:29.182 --> 02:30.945
I can think of at least
10 different ways...

02:31.017 --> 02:33.144
I'd rather be spending
my day off.

02:33.353 --> 02:36.186
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
hold everything.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.518
Make that 11.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.526
victim of the work ethic...

02:44.597 --> 02:45.962
prince of the powerless.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.361
I wouldn't go that far.

02:48.635 --> 02:51.195
Neither would I.
Who asked you?

03:00.980 --> 03:02.174
According to Devon...

03:02.248 --> 03:05.479
the late Mrs. Potts was a staunch
supporter of The Foundation.

03:05.818 --> 03:06.944
No kidding.

03:07.387 --> 03:11.016
From the looks of these cars,
staunch isn't all she was.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.390
She must've been
worth millions.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.150
$10 million to be precise.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.958
Mrs. Potts may have seemed
a bit eccentric, Michael...

03:18.031 --> 03:19.498
but she had impeccable taste
in husbands.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.194
She didn't do too badly
in diamonds, either.

03:22.268 --> 03:26.602
The auctioneer tells me that the stones
alone should fetch about $3 million...

03:26.739 --> 03:31.540
the proceeds of which have already been
earmarked to fund our various charities.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.572
So you see why I wanted
you two here with me.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.072
I smell public relations.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.707
Not an altogether
unpleasant odor.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.643
Speaking of which,
even as we speak...

03:39.719 --> 03:41.243
over my left shoulder
is a gentleman...

03:41.321 --> 03:44.620
with a corporate checkbook about to
purchase a small present for his wife.

03:44.691 --> 03:47.421
Very good. You're learning.
Excuse me.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.421
With a little practice,
you could be dangerous.

03:51.497 --> 03:54.364
Have I told you lately
it's good to have you back?

04:01.841 --> 04:05.402
Come on, let's do it. Just
remember, we do it clean.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.506
What is this, a stickup
or a political campaign?

04:08.581 --> 04:12.449
It's what I say it is, Lyle.
I plan it, it's my dance.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.423
I was told Napoleon
gave this to Josephine.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.527
Some men know
how to treat women, Michael.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.690
Yes, but do you know
what happened to Napoleon?

04:26.766 --> 04:27.733
Freeze!

04:29.068 --> 04:30.695
Nobody move! Don't!

04:33.106 --> 04:36.701
Drop the belt! Get over there!
You people, over there, now!

04:38.811 --> 04:41.939
Back up! Get off,
over there! Go!

04:53.226 --> 04:54.693
You come with this, pretty?

04:54.761 --> 04:56.661
You came for the diamonds.
Take the diamonds.

04:56.729 --> 04:59.357
One move, and that's all that's
standing between you and the grave!

04:59.432 --> 05:01.730
Don't press your luck!
Now, just a moment.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.001
The money from those jewels
is pledged to charity.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.060
Tell me about it!

05:08.174 --> 05:09.198
Go ahead!

05:10.543 --> 05:11.635
Press your luck.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.037
Come on!

05:26.893 --> 05:29.555
KITT, meet me out front.
Is he okay? Yes, go!

05:49.949 --> 05:52.110
Michael, what happened?
He hit Devon.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.552
Who hit Devon? One of those
guys on the bikes, KITT.

05:56.155 --> 05:59.386
They had what they wanted.
They didn't have to hit him.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.500
Michael, there's cars
and a truck stalled ahead.

06:14.507 --> 06:15.872
We gotta go for it, pal!

06:50.710 --> 06:53.270
Hang with them, buddy.
They got nowhere to go.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.480
Michael, unless
you're planning...

07:28.548 --> 07:30.573
on changing my design
and yours...

07:30.650 --> 07:33.244
there's absolutely no way
I can squeeze into that pipe.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.981
KITT, scan the drainage system,
they gotta come out somewhere.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.751
That's true, Michael. But right
now, they have their choice...

07:40.893 --> 07:44.590
of 25 exits, covering an area
of over 100 miles.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.597
I don't care.
I want them, KITT.

07:48.367 --> 07:51.268
Whatever it takes,
I want those guys.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.698
We did it! Didn't I tell you? Now
listen to the old pro, Charley.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.062
You sure did, Lyle.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.764
Now, you want my advice,
you come up to Napa with me...

08:28.307 --> 08:31.174
have that doc fix you up.
Time he's through...

08:31.744 --> 08:34.008
nobody's ever gonna know
who you are.

08:35.114 --> 08:38.880
But nobody knows who I am now. You're
the one with the record, Lyle...

08:38.951 --> 08:40.782
the one that's wanted
for breaking his parole.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.376
There's no one on earth
looking for me.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.549
Hey, look, all I'm saying is, you
know, you can't be too careful.

08:46.559 --> 08:50.017
Just when you least expect it, some
punk pops up out of the woodwork...

08:50.096 --> 08:52.030
and points a finger at you.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.298
All right, come on,
let's split it up.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.458
Why not?

08:59.472 --> 09:00.461
Done.

09:08.347 --> 09:12.215
Hey, what are you doing? Just
listening to the old pro, Lyle.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.453
Eliminating the only punk who
could ever point a finger at me.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.248
Come on, Charley.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.631
All right, KITT,
who's next on the list?

09:27.733 --> 09:30.224
Jody Tompkins,
the model from the auction.

09:32.471 --> 09:33.995
You sure, you don't
want some coffee?

09:34.073 --> 09:35.062
No, thanks.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.634
As you can see, modeling
is just a means to an end.

09:37.710 --> 09:38.870
I'm really an artist.

09:39.545 --> 09:43.879
Recognize it?
This? Yeah, this is...

09:45.184 --> 09:47.015
that vase and those flowers.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.250
My stove and refrigerator.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.089
Your stove
and your refrigerator.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.853
I mean, of course,
what else could it be?

09:53.926 --> 09:55.223
You been painting long?

09:57.330 --> 10:01.426
Well, ever since I broke my leg
trying to learn how to ski...

10:02.735 --> 10:06.501
which was right after I almost drowned
trying to learn how to scuba-dive.

10:07.073 --> 10:10.167
To be truthful, it began
as a matter of survival.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.672
Are you interested
in neo-expressionism?

10:12.745 --> 10:14.872
To be truthful, I'm more
interested in what happened...

10:14.947 --> 10:16.505
at the robbery at the auction
this morning.

10:16.582 --> 10:19.642
Look, I told the police everything
I know, which is nothing.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.686
I was just hired to model
some jewelry, that's all.

10:22.755 --> 10:25.383
I was hoping you might have seen
something. I mean, anything...

10:25.458 --> 10:27.722
no matter how small
or insignificant.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.496
I'm sorry your foundation
lost those diamonds.

10:32.365 --> 10:36.631
But the only thing I remember about this
morning is that I was scared to death.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.166
Well, I don't blame you for that.
Look, if anything comes to mind...

10:40.239 --> 10:42.332
you can reach me
at this number.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.540
Charley!
Hey, you okay?

10:46.846 --> 10:48.780
I am now. Thanks for coming.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.615
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.948
Charley, this is
Michael Knight...

10:54.020 --> 10:55.851
from The Foundation
for Law and Government.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.852
This is my fiance, Charley
Winters. Hi, Charley.

10:58.924 --> 11:01.290
Jody told me about the
robbery. Incredible! Any leads?

11:02.094 --> 11:03.891
No, no, nothing yet.

11:06.866 --> 11:09.801
Hello? Yeah, just a minute.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.129
Michael, it's for you.
Excuse me.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.468
Hello?
Michael...

11:15.741 --> 11:18.141
the police have just turned up
something very interesting.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.746
Right, Devon.
I'll get right out there.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.782
Well, looks like we may have
a lead after all.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.480
That was fast.
Anything you'd share?

11:29.822 --> 11:31.414
Yeah, a kid found
an abandoned bike...

11:31.490 --> 11:34.220
in the Hillcrest Canyon area.
He called the police.

11:34.493 --> 11:36.961
They speculate a falling-out
amongst the thieves.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.622
Speculate?

11:39.999 --> 11:43.025
Yeah, they found blood but
they didn't find a body. Thanks.

11:47.573 --> 11:50.007
Charley, you wouldn't believe
how awful it was.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.300
I can imagine.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.406
I just wish I didn't have
to leave so soon. Leave?

11:57.950 --> 11:59.144
What are you talking about?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.947
Remember the real estate deal
I told you about?

12:01.020 --> 12:02.920
Well, it's gonna close
faster than I thought.

12:02.988 --> 12:06.389
Real estate deal? Well, I'll go
with you. Honey, this is business.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.554
Hey, as soon as I get back,
we'll go out and tear up the town.

12:10.329 --> 12:13.127
Charley, I don't wanna
be alone.

12:13.199 --> 12:14.564
You won't even know
I'm there...

12:16.469 --> 12:17.936
unless you want to.

12:22.842 --> 12:26.300
Where are we going? A little
place up in the wine country...

12:26.912 --> 12:27.936
called Napa.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.096
Michael, you know
how I feel about dogs.

12:52.404 --> 12:55.464
But perhaps this is one job
better suited for a bloodhound.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.236
KITT, I got complete faith
in you.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.675
Besides, the Sheriff's Department
can't have their dogs...

12:59.745 --> 13:01.303
up here for another hour yet.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.746
Somehow, Michael, I don't look
upon that as a compliment.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.813
My hemometer has picked up
a figure down in that ravine.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.512
Bingo! I knew we had to find
traces of blood somewhere.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.952
Time to part company, pal. All right,
you distract him, and I'll do the rest.

13:18.130 --> 13:22.123
Be careful, Michael, there's nothing
more dangerous than a wounded animal.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.192
Michael, are you all right?

13:51.897 --> 13:55.060
Yeah, I'm just a little dusty.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.867
I don't suppose
he has any diamonds on him.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.928
No, KITT, not even
a rhinestone.

14:00.606 --> 14:03.302
But I found an airline ticket.
Where to?

14:04.410 --> 14:05.536
Napa.

14:08.447 --> 14:11.746
KITT, why would a guy like
Lyle Austin be going to Napa?

14:11.817 --> 14:12.943
A good question, Michael.

14:13.152 --> 14:16.053
He doesn't exactly seem like
a connoisseur of fine wines.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.620
You know, he was scheduled
to leave this evening.

14:19.758 --> 14:22.420
Let's run a check
on passenger reservations.

14:22.962 --> 14:26.728
See if anyone's going up there who might
have served time with him in the past.

14:26.799 --> 14:30.667
Right away. I'm cross-checking with
the Department of Corrections now.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.201
Negative, Michael.

14:33.272 --> 14:36.469
There's no one scheduled to fly
to Napa over the next 24 hours...

14:36.542 --> 14:39.272
who has ever served time
with... Michael!

14:39.879 --> 14:40.971
Yeah, what is it?

14:41.146 --> 14:43.706
There are two names here
I'm sure you'll recognize.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.543
Jody Tompkins
and Charley Winters?

14:48.621 --> 14:51.317
They caught a flight to Napa
less than an hour ago.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.924
Do you think it's just
a coincidence?

14:53.058 --> 14:57.051
Yeah, but one too many. Plot
out the fastest route to Napa.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.836
Welcome to Napa, KITT,
where wine is king.

16:17.943 --> 16:19.570
Or as the French say...

16:19.645 --> 16:22.136
"Le vin est l'elixir d'amour."

16:22.448 --> 16:25.281
That means... I think
I get the general drift.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.016
Anything on Charley Winters
yet? Negative, Michael.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.247
I ran the name through databases
in this country and abroad.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.190
No one with that name
matches the man you describe.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.461
It would certainly help
to have a picture of him.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.393
Well, we'll see
what we can do, KITT.

16:38.464 --> 16:41.092
Michael, do you think
Jody knows any of this?

16:42.534 --> 16:43.899
I don't know, pal.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.964
I'd like to believe not, but at
this point, I wouldn't count on it.

16:49.641 --> 16:51.973
Looks like someone's
having some trouble up ahead.

16:52.044 --> 16:54.239
Let's see if we can give him
a hand, huh?

17:03.088 --> 17:04.281
Oh.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.117
Looks like you could use
some help, huh?

17:07.192 --> 17:10.252
Oh, yes, we were delivering some
food and clothing to the poor...

17:10.596 --> 17:14.589
when I'm afraid we strayed a bit
too far from the straight and narrow.

17:15.267 --> 17:18.167
Oh, I'm Brother Francis.
Name's Michael Knight.

17:19.238 --> 17:23.174
And that's Brother Tyrone.
Hello. Nice to meet you.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.471
You'll have to forgive Brother
Tyrone. He's taken a vow of silence.

17:27.546 --> 17:31.107
Unfortunately, he was never
able to work without talking.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.686
Yeah, I know how that is.
And that's Kit.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.116
How did you know that?

17:38.190 --> 17:40.590
Oh, but I named him,
when he was just a little ass.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.125
I beg your pardon!

17:46.098 --> 17:48.828
Your donkey's name is Kit?
Yes.

17:49.168 --> 17:52.899
Well, you won't see any flies
on me. Yeah, it's the car.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.706
Dear Lord, a talking car?

17:59.812 --> 18:01.803
Will miracles never cease?

18:02.548 --> 18:05.540
Well, perhaps it's a sign,
Brother Tyrone.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.256
Michael, I suggest we give
them a hand and be on our way.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.580
Yeah, right.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.257
Hey, KITT!
Send a grappling hook.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.898
If you don't mind,
I believe he's talking to me.

18:30.509 --> 18:31.498
Oh, my.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.045
It even drives itself.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.275
Which is more than I can say
for Big Ears over there.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.783
What is that sign,
"Monastery of the Grape"?

18:43.856 --> 18:44.880
Oh, that's us.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.687
Perhaps you've tasted some
of our wine, Monk's Cellar?

18:48.026 --> 18:50.426
Oh, we make a perfectly
delightful cabernet.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.790
Or at least we used to until our
winemaker, Brother Julianno...

19:01.373 --> 19:03.898
Perhaps we will again someday.
The good Lord willing.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.434
I'm sure you will, Brother.
You ready, KITT?

19:10.048 --> 19:11.379
Ready, Michael.

19:12.484 --> 19:16.079
Something definitely has to be done
about this. Michael, just keep that...

19:16.221 --> 19:18.849
overgrown dog
away from my tires.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.415
After we right the wagon, we'll
tow it back on the road for you.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.792
And the sooner the better.
Bless you, both of you!

19:30.302 --> 19:32.930
Brother Tyrone,
I'm sure it's a sign.

19:33.872 --> 19:37.137
Brother Julianno's going to be
back with us soon.

19:38.710 --> 19:39.699
Soon.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.589
Come on, he's waiting.
All right, all right.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.103
This way.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.991
Inside your cage,
Brother Julianno. Inside.

21:08.667 --> 21:09.656
Go on.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.234
We'll make the eyes
a little rounder.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.796
Raise him up, please,
Nurse Jones.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.007
And, yes, narrow
the bridge of your nose...

21:25.751 --> 21:28.811
raise your cheekbones, and
even alter your fingertips.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.888
In time, you'll forget there
ever was a Charley Winters.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.822
Isn't that right, Nurse Jones?
Charley who?

21:36.228 --> 21:37.820
And how much is this
gonna cost me?

21:37.896 --> 21:41.093
I usually charge according to
what my patients can afford.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.997
From what I've heard,
you can afford quite a bit.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.195
Oh, now, wait a minute, don't
believe everything you hear.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.397
I had to split 50-50
with my partner.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.532
Your partner was shot under
mysterious circumstances...

21:51.176 --> 21:53.440
and picked up
before he got his cut.

21:53.879 --> 21:57.679
Which gives you even more reason
for wanting to become someone else...

21:57.816 --> 21:59.977
in case he ever gets out
and comes looking for you.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.848
All right.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.253
So what are we talking about?

22:07.959 --> 22:12.453
You stole around $3 million in
diamond jewelry. I like round figures.

22:12.864 --> 22:17.358
Ten percent is a nice round
figure. That's $300,000.

22:18.003 --> 22:21.370
A small price to be born again without
having to listen to a lot of sermons.

22:22.140 --> 22:26.474
Of course, that includes a new ID,
passport, credit cards, and all the other...

22:26.845 --> 22:28.642
little necessities
of modern-day life.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.078
When can we get started?

22:33.285 --> 22:37.016
I don't take Blue Cross,
Charley, but I do take white ice.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.223
You come back here
with $300,000 in diamonds...

22:41.760 --> 22:43.318
and you've got yourself
a new face.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.627
Now don't tell me.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.693
The Inn!
You recognize it?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.865
Right. Are you kidding?
What else could it be?

23:23.935 --> 23:25.835
There's the inn,
I mean... Wait a minute!

23:26.471 --> 23:29.929
You missed the left front
window. You're right.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.273
There.
Perfect.

23:38.784 --> 23:42.242
Hey, what are you doing in Napa?
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.416
Charley had some business to take care
of, so I decided to keep him company.

23:46.491 --> 23:49.654
What kind of business is he
into, anyway? Real estate.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.990
He works for the Boulder Land
Development Company. Ever hear of it?

23:53.064 --> 23:55.191
No, no, can't say that I have.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.229
Charley's one of their
top men.

23:57.803 --> 23:58.895
Bet he is.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.598
How long have you
known Charley?

24:02.040 --> 24:03.667
We're getting married
in a couple of months.

24:03.742 --> 24:04.834
That's not what I asked.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.810
Four weeks, all right?
Four weeks?

24:12.984 --> 24:15.714
Charley's a good man
and he loves me.

24:17.055 --> 24:19.148
And more importantly,
I love him.

24:32.637 --> 24:33.626
Charley!

24:36.408 --> 24:37.534
How'd the meeting go?

24:37.609 --> 24:40.009
You know me, I had them
in the palm of my hand.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.205
That's my Charley.
Look who's here.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.641
I see.
Hi.

24:44.683 --> 24:45.672
Anything we can do for you?

24:46.284 --> 24:48.980
No, no, I'm just following up
on that diamond robbery.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.449
In that case, I think you
should stop bothering Jody.

24:53.091 --> 24:55.423
Charley, he's...
She's been through enough.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.653
What she needs now
is a little R and R.

24:57.729 --> 25:01.165
So if you don't mind...
No. No, I don't mind at all.

25:03.034 --> 25:06.401
Besides, she's not
the one I'm interested in.

25:09.574 --> 25:10.563
It's you.

25:28.326 --> 25:32.660
Michael, according to Charley's vital
signs, I'd say you definitely hit a nerve.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.722
Did you get a photo scan
of him, KITT?

25:36.468 --> 25:37.958
Does that answer
your question?

25:38.036 --> 25:40.231
I'm running it through
my Image Data Bank now.

25:40.338 --> 25:41.737
Good work.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.649
Care to take one last look
at yourself before we begin?

25:56.721 --> 25:58.586
I've seen enough of myself.
Let's just do it.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.056
That's the spirit.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.550
Now, the drug should be
taking effect.

26:05.163 --> 26:08.291
I want you to begin
counting backwards from 100.

26:09.801 --> 26:12.599
Ninety-nine, ninety-eight...

26:14.639 --> 26:18.006
ninety-seven, ninety...

26:18.777 --> 26:19.766
seven...

26:25.083 --> 26:28.678
Just a minute. All right,
all right, all right.

26:34.025 --> 26:35.617
Hey, what do you want?

26:36.027 --> 26:37.824
The diamonds.
What diamonds?

26:37.896 --> 26:41.354
The diamonds I'm gonna retire
on. Now, where'd he hide them?

26:41.866 --> 26:44.266
I don't know
what you're talking about.

26:45.837 --> 26:48.305
I want those diamonds,
and I want them now.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.108
Sorry it took so long to get
a make on Charley Winters.

26:52.177 --> 26:53.974
With his past, I'm sure
it wasn't easy.

26:54.045 --> 26:56.036
Now, let's find out
what Jody can tell us.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.674
I don't see Charley's car
anywhere, Michael.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.285
KITT, scan her room.

27:04.756 --> 27:07.156
Michael, there's definitely
two people inside.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.028
I was hoping Jody
would be alone.

27:11.663 --> 27:15.724
Sure would make it a lot easier telling
her what we found out about her fiance.

27:32.183 --> 27:33.673
Come any closer
and she's dead.

27:34.619 --> 27:35.677
I hear you.

27:37.555 --> 27:38.544
Move.

27:40.358 --> 27:41.552
Just don't hurt her.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.751
Jody, be cool.
You'll be all right.

28:01.379 --> 28:04.280
You drive.
Yes, but not very well.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.182
That wasn't a question,
get in there and drive.

28:19.264 --> 28:20.925
All right, KITT,
let's get them.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.408
All right. We can't let him
see us, buddy.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.681
Another project for Bonnie.
Find a way to make me invisible.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.238
Can't you drive any faster? I told
you, I can hardly drive at all.

29:36.474 --> 29:37.839
This could be
our chance, KITT.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.103
Michael, surely there's
a more conventional way.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.579
All right, pal.

29:51.356 --> 29:52.345
Here we go.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.838
All right, I'll see you
later, pal.

30:12.911 --> 30:16.711
It's a longer jump than you think,
Michael. You had to tell me that, huh?

30:31.529 --> 30:32.996
Thanks for the lift.

30:47.312 --> 30:50.338
You're fantastic.
I have my good days.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.121
Hey, KITT, let's take him in
and see what he can tell us, huh?

31:02.327 --> 31:05.694
This is great. I mean, this is just
what we needed, the man who never was.

31:05.830 --> 31:09.231
He's got fake IDs, fake credit
cards, fake driver's license...

31:09.367 --> 31:11.460
even his fingerprints
don't belong to him.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.333
It's obvious he's been given
a totally new identity.

31:14.405 --> 31:16.236
Yeah, the question is,
who was he?

31:16.474 --> 31:18.169
Maybe KITT can tell us...

31:18.343 --> 31:21.437
with the three-dimensional Interactive
Graphics Plotter I just installed.

31:21.512 --> 31:24.208
Well, that sounds very
impressive, but what does it do?

31:24.449 --> 31:26.383
See for yourself. KITT?

31:26.751 --> 31:30.585
It's obvious our friend here has
undergone extensive plastic surgery...

31:30.655 --> 31:33.749
so I'll simply use the IGP
to break down his new face...

31:33.825 --> 31:36.419
and then activate my Linear
Predictive Graphics Routine...

31:36.494 --> 31:39.019
to give us a 3-D reconstruction
of his previous face.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.325
You're remarkable, KITT.

31:41.599 --> 31:44.898
Of course, that goes for you,
too, Bonnie. Thank you very much.

31:45.103 --> 31:47.037
And now I'll search
my Image Data Bank.

31:53.444 --> 31:56.174
Does the name Eric Sanders
mean anything to you?

31:56.581 --> 31:58.913
The condemned murderer who
escaped from death row last year?

32:00.084 --> 32:02.484
They've been looking for him
everywhere. Wait a minute.

32:03.655 --> 32:04.747
That's it.

32:04.856 --> 32:08.348
If Charley Winters is our man, that's why
he went to Napa. To buy a new identity.

32:08.893 --> 32:11.555
Where in Napa does one go
to buy such a thing, Michael?

32:11.663 --> 32:12.960
That's a very good question.

32:13.031 --> 32:15.158
When I find out the answer,
you'll be the first to know.

32:31.549 --> 32:33.881
Michael, you don't know
Charley's a thief.

32:33.952 --> 32:37.410
The police searched that room inside
out and they couldn't find any diamonds.

32:37.488 --> 32:40.457
Which only means Charley
must've taken them with him.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.818
I do know one thing,
he is not who he says he is.

32:45.029 --> 32:49.022
What do you mean?
His real name's James Benson.

32:49.934 --> 32:53.028
Over the years he's had
a half a dozen aliases.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.239
Before he crashed into the big
time, he was a con artist...

32:56.374 --> 32:59.104
and there was always
a pretty woman involved.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.976
Jody, he was engaged
to three of them.

33:03.781 --> 33:06.045
I don't believe you.
I think you do.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.642
You told me yourself it was more
important for you to love him...

33:08.720 --> 33:10.312
than it was for him
to love you.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.854
Maybe you suspected
he didn't love you as much...

33:12.924 --> 33:15.449
and that he was only
using you. That's a lie!

33:17.395 --> 33:18.760
Then where is he?

33:19.230 --> 33:22.495
I told you, he went to go look
at some land in Rosa Linda.

33:23.634 --> 33:27.434
The Boulder Land Development Company
doesn't exist. I checked it out.

33:27.939 --> 33:30.169
He loves me, Michael.
I'm sure of it.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.504
Look, maybe he says he does...

33:34.045 --> 33:36.172
but I'm telling you, it's not
the kind of love you want...

33:36.247 --> 33:37.771
or the kind of love
that you need.

33:38.616 --> 33:42.211
Now, do you have any
idea where he is? No.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.678
When you got to Napa,
what did you do?

33:45.523 --> 33:47.081
We checked in here.

33:47.158 --> 33:50.685
After that? Now, come on,
think. It could be important.

33:51.963 --> 33:54.363
We went to this winery.
Which winery?

33:57.001 --> 34:00.164
The Monk's Cellar. What did
you do when you got there?

34:00.304 --> 34:02.602
We went to where you
taste the wine...

34:03.875 --> 34:06.708
and Charley did something
kind of strange. What?

34:07.045 --> 34:09.980
He asked for a glass
of Chateauneuf du Pape.

34:12.083 --> 34:16.143
A French wine in a California
winery? I told you it was strange.

34:16.521 --> 34:20.116
All right, what happened after
that? He sent me on the tour and...

34:20.824 --> 34:23.658
when I came back he was
there waiting. All right.

34:23.728 --> 34:24.853
Are you going to be okay?

34:24.929 --> 34:27.989
Yeah, what can happen with this private
security guard following me around?

34:28.065 --> 34:31.001
Absolutely nothing.
That's exactly what I want.

34:32.603 --> 34:33.592
Thanks.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.438
It'll have to look like
the police are hot on my tail.

34:45.516 --> 34:49.509
I got it! We invent a crime,
feed it to the wire services.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.051
As you wish, Michael.
Let's see.

34:52.123 --> 34:55.024
I think you fit
the embezzler mode.

34:55.793 --> 34:58.819
Thanks a lot, pal, but I was thinking
of something a little more violent.

34:58.896 --> 34:59.954
Let's see.

35:04.402 --> 35:06.597
That's it! Armed robbery.

35:06.704 --> 35:10.071
Michael, I'm sorry. But armed
robbery just isn't you.

35:10.808 --> 35:12.298
I still think embezzling...

35:12.376 --> 35:15.277
KITT, if I'm gonna pull it
off, I gotta go for broke here!

35:15.346 --> 35:18.247
Whatever you say,
Public Enemy Number One.

35:19.283 --> 35:24.084
I'm also gonna need some front
money. My guess is about $100,000.

35:24.322 --> 35:28.315
Michael, you know how Devon feels
about money. Front or any other kind.

35:28.392 --> 35:32.419
Just get him. It's our only chance
of getting those diamonds back, KITT.

36:07.431 --> 36:10.832
It's very good. Now how about
a glass of...

36:11.969 --> 36:13.630
Chateauneuf du Pape.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.139
What?

36:16.574 --> 36:21.511
You heard me, Brother. A glass
of Chateauneuf du Pape.

36:26.817 --> 36:31.311
And as icing on the cake, I can
give you a slight break in your nose.

36:32.123 --> 36:34.455
It's quite popular these days.

36:35.626 --> 36:36.718
Something wrong, Doc?

36:37.161 --> 36:39.425
I see you've had extensive
plastic surgery before.

36:40.598 --> 36:41.860
Any particular reason?

36:41.933 --> 36:44.902
Yeah, well, my face became
too popular with the cops.

36:45.803 --> 36:47.270
I know the feeling.

36:48.005 --> 36:50.974
Well, what do you think?

36:53.678 --> 36:56.374
What do you think?
It's definitely you.

36:56.914 --> 37:01.078
Then let's get on with it.
Good. Now about the fee.

37:02.019 --> 37:04.715
How much did you say you got
from that armored truck hit?

37:04.789 --> 37:06.120
$1.1 million.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.454
That's strange. Because when
my people checked you out...

37:09.527 --> 37:11.825
they told me it was
more like $1.5 million.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.262
Yeah, well, after the first
million, who's counting, huh?

37:14.632 --> 37:18.568
Well, I'm glad you feel that
way, because I want $150,000.

37:18.703 --> 37:21.900
Dr. Fellows, I got $100,000
in here.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.999
Take it or leave it.
In that case, I'll take it.

37:25.409 --> 37:28.276
When do we get started?
Within the hour.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.547
Just make yourself at home.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.860
Black 9 on the red 10.
Get lost.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.561
You have no right
to keep me prisoner like this.

38:27.838 --> 38:30.807
Take it up with your
congressman, Brother Julianno.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.368
Get in there.

38:44.188 --> 38:45.621
Afternoon, Brother.

39:05.609 --> 39:07.304
Anything wrong, Charley?

39:07.712 --> 39:09.509
Looks like you've seen
a ghost.

39:09.914 --> 39:13.179
Not yet, Nurse Jones,
but he'll be one soon.

39:13.918 --> 39:15.010
Get me Dr. Fellows.

39:35.673 --> 39:37.607
This is totally humiliating.

39:43.681 --> 39:44.909
"Pursuit Mode."

39:46.584 --> 39:47.744
"Turbo Boost."

39:49.286 --> 39:50.947
"Eject" button?

39:52.390 --> 39:53.379
Oh.

39:53.824 --> 39:56.122
Truly the design of
a supreme being.

39:56.193 --> 39:57.820
KITT, I found Charley's room.

39:58.095 --> 39:59.153
What about the diamonds?

40:00.030 --> 40:03.022
I'm looking for them now.
Is Brother Francis with you?

40:03.200 --> 40:04.633
I have Brother Francis...

40:04.702 --> 40:06.260
and Brother Tyrone
here with me.

40:06.837 --> 40:08.236
What did you get
on Dr. Fellows?

40:08.305 --> 40:10.000
He was kicked out of
the American Institute...

40:10.074 --> 40:12.201
of Plastic Surgery
almost a year ago.

40:12.476 --> 40:14.671
That's when he showed up at
The Monastery of the Grape...

40:14.779 --> 40:17.077
with an offer of
financial assistance.

40:17.181 --> 40:20.844
You see, the monastery
had hit upon hard times.

40:21.519 --> 40:23.487
But we had no idea he was
going to be...

40:23.554 --> 40:26.079
using the winery
as a front for his...

40:27.191 --> 40:30.683
pardon the pun, illegal operations.
Why didn't you go to the police?

40:30.761 --> 40:32.388
Because they're holding our
winemaker...

40:32.463 --> 40:34.055
Brother Julianno, hostage.

40:34.965 --> 40:37.263
They said they'd hurt him
if we tried to get help.

40:38.502 --> 40:40.936
I saw Brother Julianno.
He's okay.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.545
Bingo. KITT,
I found the diamonds.

40:52.716 --> 40:54.741
I knew you could do it,
Michael.

41:10.034 --> 41:13.470
Okay, I'm gonna take off and
see if I can find Charley now.

41:13.604 --> 41:17.165
Be careful, Michael. I don't know why,
but I've grown accustomed to your face.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.834
Truly, truly a miracle!

41:29.253 --> 41:32.347
Bell ringing time already?
See if he's got my diamonds!

41:32.423 --> 41:35.449
Charley! I wish I could say
it's an improvement.

41:35.593 --> 41:39.256
KITT, if you don't hear from
me in 30 seconds, come get me.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.370
Make that 10.
That shot won't last long.

41:52.443 --> 41:53.467
Get him into surgery.

41:55.412 --> 41:58.210
Is there another way
into Dr. Fellows' office?

41:58.916 --> 42:01.578
Only if you like going
through solid brick walls.

42:01.652 --> 42:05.281
It's not my favorite pastime, but it
sure beats socializing with a donkey!

42:19.637 --> 42:23.129
Let's find out how much this
foundation knows about us.

42:41.258 --> 42:42.350
That's it!

42:58.108 --> 42:59.837
Glory, hallelujah!

43:00.344 --> 43:02.744
Now that's the way
to break a vow of silence!

43:02.813 --> 43:04.508
Michael. Michael.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.071
Michael.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.309
Michael.

43:10.821 --> 43:14.257
What is that thing?
Thanks, pal.

43:18.362 --> 43:19.351
Brother Julianno.

43:19.663 --> 43:21.028
What is it now?

43:21.098 --> 43:22.258
Come on, I'm a friend.

43:22.466 --> 43:24.525
Oh, God... God bless you,
my son!

43:29.440 --> 43:32.705
KITT, have Devon notify the police
to round up Fellows and the others.

43:32.776 --> 43:33.765
Come on, get in.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.514
Meet me outside.
Right.

44:27.731 --> 44:30.222
Bless you, my son. And
nail that sucker. Amen!

44:37.841 --> 44:39.433
Let him blow off
some steam, pal.

44:39.510 --> 44:43.708
He's not going anywhere, and he'll be a
whole lot easier to handle once he does.

45:40.337 --> 45:41.668
All right, take over, KITT.

45:42.306 --> 45:43.898
I'm gonna go
for a little swim.

46:24.882 --> 46:28.943
All right, get Devon. We gotta raise
some money for that charity, huh?

46:46.170 --> 46:50.163
My, this is a fine cabernet!
Pity you can't have some, KITT.

46:50.240 --> 46:53.232
I don't need artificial stimulants
to make me feel good, Devon.

46:53.744 --> 46:54.836
Bless you.

46:55.979 --> 46:57.537
Oh, well, cheers anyway.

46:59.917 --> 47:03.580
As you know, I'm not much of a
speechmaker, I'd just like to say...

47:03.854 --> 47:06.550
thank you for your help
and God bless you.

47:07.291 --> 47:09.987
That was a beautiful speech,
Brother Tyrone.

47:10.961 --> 47:12.519
Cheers.
Hear, hear.

47:14.598 --> 47:15.724
Who asked you?

47:17.534 --> 47:19.525
Brothers, we have work to do.

47:20.103 --> 47:22.833
Our thanks to you all.
Bye-bye. All right, see you.

47:23.807 --> 47:26.105
Oh, Jody, I almost forgot.
Great news.

47:26.176 --> 47:28.838
Devon has agreed to buy two of
your paintings. Haven't you, Devon?

47:29.847 --> 47:32.873
Agreed? Oh, insisted
is more like it.

47:32.950 --> 47:34.076
Thanks.

47:34.151 --> 47:37.746
And, Michael, to show you my appreciation
to you, I painted your portrait.

47:37.821 --> 47:40.551
I can hardly wait. Whoa.

47:41.158 --> 47:44.992
That is fantastic.
I also painted one of Kit.

47:45.095 --> 47:49.498
Jody, you shouldn't have. Although
I have been told I have nice lines.

47:50.067 --> 47:51.898
Why don't you show KITT?

47:55.639 --> 47:59.632
On second thought, Devon, maybe
some wine is exactly what I need.

48:01.044 --> 48:04.036
And, Michael, keep that thing
away from me.
