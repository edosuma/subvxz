00:22.205 --> 00:25.746
Dre changed my life.

00:25.747 --> 00:27.830
He changed my family's life.

00:28.872 --> 00:30.995
He made Interscope what it is.

00:30.996 --> 00:34.204
We've been through a lot together,

00:34.205 --> 00:36.287
and we developed this bond.

00:36.288 --> 00:39.871
And I never felt a guy
behind me at Interscope,

00:39.872 --> 00:42.496
during the most
difficult time at Interscope,

00:42.497 --> 00:44.954
that I never had to blink,

00:44.955 --> 00:47.454
never once thought about it.

00:47.455 --> 00:49.871
Instinctively, I knew who he was.

00:49.872 --> 00:51.162
Got me in a lot of trouble.

00:51.163 --> 00:52.954
I do ten depositions a month...

00:52.955 --> 00:55.537
still.

00:55.538 --> 00:56.913
And I'll tell you what.

00:56.914 --> 01:00.329
He's been makin' me
look like a fuckin' genius...

01:00.330 --> 01:03.747
for 12 years right now.

01:05.497 --> 01:07.663
And, you know, what can I say?

01:07.664 --> 01:10.329
Dr. Dre, you're the greatest
that ever lived,

01:10.330 --> 01:11.829
and we've only just begun.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.829
- All right.
- Nicole, I love you.

01:13.830 --> 01:15.621
We're all drinking.

01:21.538 --> 01:24.412
Reinventin' yourself is one of the most

01:24.413 --> 01:26.663
difficult things you could possibly do,

01:26.664 --> 01:30.162
especially if you're talkin'
about the music business.

01:30.163 --> 01:32.954
Oh my goodness.

01:32.955 --> 01:34.789
This is a lesson to the boys.

01:36.121 --> 01:38.037
If everywhere you go...

01:38.038 --> 01:39.871
you're bringing your past with you,

01:39.872 --> 01:42.287
you never can take the next step.

01:42.288 --> 01:45.704
And I think Jimmy wanted to...

01:45.705 --> 01:47.287
be the person to help Dre do that.

01:47.288 --> 01:49.954
You go through the
worst times of your life

01:49.955 --> 01:51.287
before you get to the best times.

01:51.288 --> 01:54.037
And by the power invested in me
by the state of Hawaii...

01:54.038 --> 01:56.162
to pronounce you...

01:56.163 --> 02:00.162
I think it takes age
and experience to realize that.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.037
I guess I'm a grown-up now, you know.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.746
That's basically it.

02:20.914 --> 02:22.746
So, when I decided to leave Death Row,

02:22.747 --> 02:25.412
I started my new label, Aftermath.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.704

New company.

02:38.580 --> 02:40.037
He made a nice label deal,

02:40.038 --> 02:43.162
and he had a true 50/50
partnership with Interscope.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.037
And it was Dre controlling it,

02:45.038 --> 02:46.579
Dre running it, Dre's in charge.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.621
Aftermath was Dre's label.
I started it with Interscope.

02:49.622 --> 02:51.913
I just thought
he was getting his footing.

02:51.914 --> 02:53.287
I was tryin' some things.

02:53.288 --> 02:55.663
I'm with an entirely
new group of people.

02:55.664 --> 02:58.454
I'm just experimenting, and, um...

02:58.455 --> 03:00.454
- So...
- And, um...

03:00.455 --> 03:02.371
You know.

03:02.372 --> 03:04.579

03:12.455 --> 03:16.872
Everybody that's been ridin' with you
for all these years, that shit flips.

03:19.121 --> 03:22.412
And then, another flop.

03:22.413 --> 03:23.871
It was a fuckin' disaster.

03:23.872 --> 03:25.454
Because the tracks weren't hitting.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.287
It was... got to be...

03:27.288 --> 03:30.079
a big, big number that...
that he was in the hole.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.621
I was getting a lot of pressure,
corporately, to get rid of Dre.

03:33.622 --> 03:36.287
I said, "Well, we could do that.

03:36.288 --> 03:39.496
"And then you save my salary as well,

03:39.497 --> 03:41.223

03:53.747 --> 03:55.537
exactly what it is...

03:55.538 --> 03:57.537
record, business.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.454
And you have to take care of both.

03:59.455 --> 04:00.829
It is a job.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.663
It ain't about who has the most jewelry.

04:02.664 --> 04:03.954
It's about saving.

04:03.955 --> 04:06.162
I want my kids to start
on another level.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.704
I don't want 'em
to start in the projects.

04:08.705 --> 04:10.829
But no matter how hard
you work in the studio,

04:10.830 --> 04:13.329
you don't know if people
are gonna dig it,

04:13.330 --> 04:15.663
and I found that
just recently, you know.

04:15.664 --> 04:18.454
I put out the record,
and it's not selling as fast.

04:18.454 --> 04:22.204
But it's time to move on
and come up with some new shit.

04:22.205 --> 04:25.329
Back in those days, I didn't
have an artist to work with.

04:25.330 --> 04:28.037
I would go to Jimmy's house, and
we'd have listening sessions.

04:28.038 --> 04:30.371
He was tryin' to help me figure out

04:30.372 --> 04:32.371
where I was gonna go with my music.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.537
And he would take me down to his garage.

04:34.538 --> 04:37.537
There was cassette tapes everywhere.

04:37.538 --> 04:41.579
And I remember him
pickin' up this cassette tape,

04:41.580 --> 04:43.871
he pops this in,

What happens?

05:45.580 --> 05:47.120
Um...

05:47.121 --> 05:50.412
I just want to be known
as a legitimate MC,

06:06.622 --> 06:09.287

06:09.288 --> 06:12.746
I was just really down that
I had got all the way to the end

06:12.747 --> 06:14.037
in Rap Olympics and lost.

06:14.038 --> 06:15.746
And this kid came up
to me and he was like,

06:15.747 --> 06:17.120
"Hey man, can I get one of your tapes?"

06:17.121 --> 06:20.621
And I think I probably just...
"Here," you know. Whatever.

06:20.622 --> 06:23.287
Okay, so fast-forward to...

06:23.288 --> 06:26.704

06:29.455 --> 06:32.913

Holy shit, I just shit myself.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.329
I'm pissing myself now
thinking about it.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.079
It all happened like that?

06:40.080 --> 06:42.621
Yeah, I'm pissing right now.

06:42.622 --> 06:44.162
So Eminem comes in,

06:44.163 --> 06:47.746
in this bright yellow
fuckin' sweat suit,

06:47.747 --> 06:49.329
hoodie, pants, everything.

06:49.330 --> 06:52.496
It's bright fucking yellow, you know?

06:52.497 --> 06:54.954
And I'm like, "Wow."

06:54.955 --> 06:57.496
I'm lookin' at Dre like,

06:57.497 --> 07:00.663
"Dude, I see you on TV all the time.

07:00.664 --> 07:04.995
You're one of my biggest
influences, ever, in life."

07:04.996 --> 07:06.913
I'm like, "Man, listen,

07:06.914 --> 07:09.287
"I think this shit
is fuckin' incredible,

07:09.288 --> 07:11.704
and I would love to work with you."

07:11.705 --> 07:13.204
And I had a studio
in my house at the time,

07:13.205 --> 07:15.037
and I had went in and put
some samples together,

07:15.038 --> 07:16.871
did a couple of things
in the drum machine,

07:16.872 --> 07:18.412
and I invited him over.

07:18.413 --> 07:19.788
Dre, you do a lot of recording here?

07:19.789 --> 07:21.829
Yeah, yeah. Most of the
recordin' is done here.

07:21.830 --> 07:23.496
Nothin' more comfortable than home.

07:23.497 --> 07:26.037

- You wanna hear one of my joints, man?
- Yeah.

07:29.163 --> 07:31.537

07:31.538 --> 07:34.871

09:42.955 --> 09:44.913
and ended up being like this.

09:44.914 --> 09:46.788
Because, you know.

09:46.789 --> 09:49.329
And everyone was tellin' him,

09:49.330 --> 09:50.788
"Don't fuck with him."

09:50.789 --> 09:52.995
Everybody around me,

09:52.996 --> 09:54.829
the so-called execs and what have you

09:54.830 --> 09:56.995
were all against it.

09:56.996 --> 09:59.829
The records that I had done
at the time, they didn't work.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.537
They wanted me out of the building.

10:01.538 --> 10:04.829
And then, I come up
with Eminem, this white boy.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.788
Me, Slim Shady.

10:07.789 --> 10:11.120
My general manager had this
8x10 picture and was like,

10:11.121 --> 10:13.204
"Dre, this boy's got blue eyes.

10:13.205 --> 10:14.704
What are we doin'?"

10:14.705 --> 10:18.704
We weren't looking for
a white, controversial rapper.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.371
We were looking for great.

10:21.372 --> 10:24.037
I go back to Detroit.
I'm fuckin' bummed out,

10:24.038 --> 10:25.871
and I remember just thinking,

10:25.872 --> 10:29.037
this is probably
not gonna happen for me.

10:29.038 --> 10:31.204
I had just got evicted from my house

10:31.205 --> 10:33.204
with nowhere really to live.

10:33.205 --> 10:36.579
The timing of this was so fuckin' crazy.

10:36.580 --> 10:40.079
Both of us were in
really bad situations,

10:40.080 --> 10:44.371
and not only did we click
with the music,

10:44.372 --> 10:45.621
we became friends.

10:45.622 --> 10:47.663
He's my friend. He's really my friend.

10:47.664 --> 10:48.913
He...

10:48.914 --> 10:50.829
He's pretending, but he's my...
that's my friend.

10:50.830 --> 10:52.537
I thought he was really clever.

10:52.538 --> 10:54.496
I thought he was sayin'
some crazy stuff, you know.

10:54.497 --> 10:57.704
The stuff he was sayin' was
just so out there, you know,

10:57.705 --> 10:59.622
but I trusted Dre.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.412
It's just like, "Okay.

11:02.413 --> 11:04.079
"Fuck it. I'm throwin' the dice.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.704
I'm bettin' all the marbles on Eminem."

11:07.705 --> 11:10.037
I knew he was taking a risk,

11:10.038 --> 11:11.746
but I just didn't know

11:11.747 --> 11:14.663
how much internal shit he was fighting.

11:14.664 --> 11:16.664
You know, I owe him my life for that.

11:18.038 --> 11:20.204
No bullshit. Like, I know...

11:20.205 --> 11:21.995
you risked it all for me.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.871
And the winner is...
Eminem "My Name Is."

11:35.372 --> 11:37.579
I wanna thank Dr. Dre,

11:37.580 --> 11:38.995
everybody at Interscope Records

11:38.996 --> 11:41.537
for makin' this possible,
and Paul Rosenberg.

11:41.538 --> 11:43.037
We just came back

11:43.038 --> 11:44.913
from somewhere in the south of France.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.704
- That's how much fun you was having.
- You know.

11:47.705 --> 11:49.287
I don't even remember
what day it is right now.

11:49.288 --> 11:51.329
You know what I mean?
I'm havin' a blast out here.

11:53.789 --> 11:55.204
After my first album came out,

11:55.205 --> 11:57.120
Dre would always say things to me like,

11:57.121 --> 11:58.454
"You've gotta work hard to get it,

11:58.455 --> 12:00.704
and you've gotta work
twice as hard to maintain it."

12:00.705 --> 12:02.704
Dre always says, makin' a hit record

12:02.705 --> 12:05.162
is the easiest thing in the world to do.

12:05.163 --> 12:06.329
At the same time,

12:06.330 --> 12:09.162
it's the hardest shit you'll ever do.

12:29.413 --> 12:32.496
And when the Slim Shady LP came out,

12:32.497 --> 12:34.162
I was so excited because

12:34.163 --> 12:36.329
it was somethin' that was brand-new

12:36.330 --> 12:37.746
and it worked.

12:37.747 --> 12:39.995

17:23.538 --> 17:25.663
But right when I got to Interscope,

17:25.664 --> 17:28.537
Jimmy said to me,
"The business is in crisis."

17:35.955 --> 17:38.371
In the past, the
music business has been able

17:38.372 --> 17:39.913
to exploit new technology.

17:39.914 --> 17:41.287
This time that's not working.

17:41.288 --> 17:43.871
The Internet has changed the equation.

17:43.872 --> 17:47.746
By every measure, there's a
crisis in the music business.

17:59.830 --> 18:03.788
We explained to Dre what Napster was,

18:03.789 --> 18:05.829
and he goes, "Just show me."

18:05.830 --> 18:07.663
You entered "Dr. Dre,"

18:07.664 --> 18:12.663
and, like, 400,000 songs
of his came up for free.

18:12.664 --> 18:15.245
Oh, wow. This is free?

18:15.246 --> 18:18.788
It's people trading music
one song at a time.

18:18.789 --> 18:22.746
And from there, I realized
how toast we really were.

18:22.747 --> 18:26.371
Then he went on a kind of
anti-piracy crusade.

18:29.538 --> 18:32.287

I said, "Yes, it is. Yes, it is."

19:20.288 --> 19:22.329
fall apart with technology.

19:22.330 --> 19:24.663
Every artist is being ripped off.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.913
If anybody says anything other
than that, it's nonsense.

19:27.914 --> 19:32.412
It's piracy, and it's affecting
anyone that's involved in music.

19:32.413 --> 19:33.704
That kind of sucks for the artist,

19:33.705 --> 19:35.579
but that's... I mean,
that's just the reality.

19:35.580 --> 19:38.245
So, Jimmy had a meeting with Intel.

19:38.246 --> 19:39.954
He wanted to understand

19:39.955 --> 19:41.496
how to fix the problem,

19:41.497 --> 19:43.704
and this guy's response to Jimmy was,

19:43.705 --> 19:46.705
"Not all businesses
are meant to last forever."

19:48.121 --> 19:51.120
So, I said to Doug Morris, I said, "Man,

19:51.121 --> 19:54.872
I do not want to be the guy
that sold the last CD."

19:57.747 --> 20:00.995
We have something
really exciting for you today.

20:00.996 --> 20:04.204
Here's a guy who
presented a complete idea...

20:04.205 --> 20:06.663
You can download an entire CD

20:06.664 --> 20:08.371
into iPod in five to ten seconds.

20:08.372 --> 20:11.329
And showed us how
we could make money again.

20:11.330 --> 20:13.621
First call I made, "Jimmy,
you got to meet this guy.

20:13.622 --> 20:15.329
This guy's like no one you ever met."

20:15.330 --> 20:17.204
So, I went up there, and I met him.

20:17.205 --> 20:18.954
And it gave me a feeling

20:18.955 --> 20:21.079
of when I first got
in the record business.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.371
Like, "Oh! This is where the party is.

20:24.372 --> 20:25.995
The party's at Steve's house."

20:25.996 --> 20:29.496
He would see Steve
Jobs as a creative person,

20:29.497 --> 20:31.287
one of those people
he'd always looked up to,

20:31.288 --> 20:32.954
admired and wanted to work with.

20:32.955 --> 20:34.913
He's like, "I need that kind of person."

20:34.914 --> 20:37.162
I wanted to learn from this guy,

20:37.163 --> 20:40.829
and understand how
and why they do what they do.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.329
And they both were workaholics.

20:43.330 --> 20:45.496
If there was 25 hours in the day,

20:45.497 --> 20:47.120
they would try for 26.

20:47.121 --> 20:50.330
They never stop going
for what they're trying to do.

21:00.330 --> 21:01.788
Hey, Jimmy.

21:01.789 --> 21:03.788
There you are! How was the tour?

21:03.789 --> 21:06.079
I just landed. I'm in the car.
I'm just gonna go home.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.079
Well, I have a studio booked
with Pharrell right now,

21:08.080 --> 21:09.496
and if you wanna work with this guy,

21:09.497 --> 21:11.287
you gotta go down
to the studio now, Gwen.

21:11.288 --> 21:14.245
I'm so tired! I need to sleep
is what I need to do right now.

21:14.246 --> 21:16.413
I'm gonna do it,
but I gotta get inspired.

21:24.330 --> 21:27.538
♪ What an amazing time ♪

21:28.747 --> 21:32.204
♪ What a family ♪

21:33.705 --> 21:37.205
♪ How did the years go by? ♪

21:43.413 --> 21:46.204
You know what? When
it comes to release dates,

21:46.205 --> 21:48.079
I think...

21:48.080 --> 21:51.705
release dates are the enemy
of creativity.

21:53.455 --> 21:56.412
You know? You never know
when you're gonna be inspired,

21:56.413 --> 21:58.454
what's gonna inspire you, and...

21:58.455 --> 22:01.830
you can't put a time limit
on creativity.

22:05.246 --> 22:09.079
You know, I don't know
if the idea that I have today

22:09.080 --> 22:10.913
is the good idea.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.079
You don't know. You know what I mean?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.871
Huh.

22:14.872 --> 22:17.914
We're artists.
We're just being creative.

22:20.163 --> 22:21.746
So it's like, man,

22:21.747 --> 22:24.245
shut the fuck up and let us do our job.

22:26.205 --> 22:30.330
And then, we'll give it to you
and you can make your money.

22:31.622 --> 22:35.913
And every piece of music
that I do or create,

22:35.914 --> 22:38.162
it isn't for the public.

22:38.163 --> 22:40.913
Oh, shit! Fuck outta here, Charlie.

22:42.955 --> 22:45.537
What frustrates me the most about Dre

22:45.538 --> 22:48.788
is easily what he considers perfection.

22:48.789 --> 22:51.788
And I think what he's calling perfection

22:51.789 --> 22:55.454
is really something else disguised
as perfection, you know.

22:55.455 --> 22:57.621
So I don't wanna psychoanalyze him

22:57.622 --> 23:00.954
'cause that is a door
I don't wanna walk into.

23:00.955 --> 23:03.162
So, let's see what we can do
on this verse.

23:03.163 --> 23:05.829
You can't smoke no regular
blunt when you come see Dr. Dre.

23:05.830 --> 23:07.829
So I gotta come right
or I don't come at all.

23:07.830 --> 23:10.162
- Playback.
- Time is not a factor...

23:10.163 --> 23:12.829
in anything Dr. Dre does.

23:12.830 --> 23:14.329
It doesn't exist.

23:14.330 --> 23:16.746
If you wanna see a master at work,

23:16.747 --> 23:18.788
go in the studio with Dre.

23:18.789 --> 23:20.120
Just watch him.

23:20.121 --> 23:22.746
I-I've never seen anybody
do it like him.

23:22.747 --> 23:23.954
How the fuck's he doing that?

23:23.955 --> 23:25.162
What's your approach?

23:25.163 --> 23:26.829
Dre's not just an engineer,

23:26.830 --> 23:28.704
which is an incredibly technical craft.

23:28.705 --> 23:30.746
He's not just an artist,
not just a mixer.

23:30.747 --> 23:32.621
He's a producer and a songwriter.

23:32.622 --> 23:34.871
I don't know whatever that word is
in Latin, but he's that threat.

23:34.872 --> 23:38.329
He operates only for the
sake of what he's creating.

23:38.330 --> 23:40.412
That's why his sound is like it is.

23:40.413 --> 23:44.704
Because he has put
every bit of himself into it.

23:44.705 --> 23:46.454
But somewhere along the line,

23:46.455 --> 23:47.746
I don't know what it was,

23:47.747 --> 23:49.371
but whenever we got in the studio,

23:49.372 --> 23:51.371
he would play me shit
and I'd be like, yo,

23:51.372 --> 23:52.954
that's fuckin' crazy.

23:52.955 --> 23:54.496
And he'd be like, "I-I...

23:54.497 --> 23:56.954
"I gotta change this line
and I gotta change that line.

23:56.955 --> 23:58.412
I don't like the snare drum on this."

23:58.413 --> 23:59.913
Take the snare drum out of the roll.

23:59.914 --> 24:01.746
"I don't like the way this beat sounds."

24:01.747 --> 24:03.204
"Do it again, do it again, do it again."

24:03.205 --> 24:04.287
"I like this part of the beat,

24:04.288 --> 24:05.746
but I don't like this part of the beat."

24:06.996 --> 24:08.245
Stick!

24:08.246 --> 24:09.954
♪ Oh, fuck ♪

24:09.955 --> 24:12.746
When you're trying
to push the boundaries on things,

24:12.747 --> 24:17.204
when you're moving into different
types of, you know, frontiers that

24:17.205 --> 24:20.204
hadn't been tested before,

24:20.205 --> 24:23.246
sometimes you need to be indulged.

24:25.497 --> 24:26.954
Detox.

24:26.955 --> 24:28.995
Detox.

24:28.996 --> 24:30.954
Dre was working
on Detox for a long time.

24:30.955 --> 24:33.579
I dropped five albums since the day

24:33.580 --> 24:35.913
Detox supposed to come out

24:35.914 --> 24:38.079
till the day it didn't come out.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.329
Five albums.

24:39.330 --> 24:41.037
Everybody was waitin' for Detox.

24:41.038 --> 24:44.079
But his standards
wouldn't allow him to put it out.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.037
"Nope. Nope."
Over and over and over again.

24:47.038 --> 24:48.871
I don't know what he's lookin' for.

24:48.872 --> 24:51.038
I don't know if he knows
what he's lookin' for.

24:52.455 --> 24:53.663
I been through writer's block

24:53.664 --> 24:55.704
and I've also been
through many, many times

24:55.705 --> 24:57.663
where I'm not sure of myself.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.079
But my shit was garbage.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.621
That's not garbage though.

25:03.246 --> 25:07.120
Everything for Andre
is based on what he feels.

25:07.121 --> 25:10.287
If it doesn't feel good,
it's not happening.

25:10.288 --> 25:14.287
If he's feelin' it,
you cannot stop him, you know.

25:14.288 --> 25:16.663
It's like blood running
through your veins.

25:16.664 --> 25:21.454
That means a lot of time
spent away in a head space.

25:21.455 --> 25:24.704
Searchin' for the notes,
the sounds and stuff.

25:24.705 --> 25:27.162
That's a constant for him.

25:27.163 --> 25:30.954
I respect his creativity.

25:30.955 --> 25:32.954
I respect the music.

25:32.955 --> 25:35.454
We know what he's doing,
we know what it takes.

25:35.455 --> 25:37.038
But, you know...

25:38.455 --> 25:40.120
there have been certain times,

25:40.121 --> 25:41.829
when I wasn't sure if,

25:41.830 --> 25:44.413
you know, we were gonna
be able to make it through.

25:46.705 --> 25:49.788
Look, this is what we married.

25:49.789 --> 25:52.621
If you're gonna say,
"I want an ordinary husband,"

25:52.622 --> 25:54.788
well, then, you can't marry a genius.

25:54.789 --> 25:59.162
A lot of extremes because
genius needs to feed itself.

25:59.163 --> 26:01.162
It needs to make its own hours.

26:01.163 --> 26:04.245
It needs to not talk to you
when it doesn't want to.

26:04.246 --> 26:06.830
It needs to be the sickest in the house.

26:07.955 --> 26:11.246
I didn't wanna
get a divorce until I did.

26:15.497 --> 26:18.621
You know, it's...
it's... I would imagine

26:18.622 --> 26:20.788
that it would be very hard
to be married to me,

26:20.789 --> 26:22.829
because I was so focused

26:22.830 --> 26:26.329
on what I was trying to accomplish.

26:26.330 --> 26:30.954
He had always been
that much of a firebrand,

26:30.955 --> 26:32.454
and that intense,

26:32.455 --> 26:34.830
but I could take it.

26:36.955 --> 26:38.704
We could've said to each other,

26:38.705 --> 26:42.537
"Hey, big shot, take it down a notch."

26:42.538 --> 26:44.621
But neither of us really
wanted to take it down a notch.

26:44.622 --> 26:48.121
We wanted to be exactly
who each of us had become.

26:49.830 --> 26:52.204
Once Vicki was really out of his life,

26:52.205 --> 26:54.371
a wife who had planned everything,

26:54.372 --> 26:55.663
he needed help, because

26:55.664 --> 26:57.913
his father may have been a longshoreman,

26:57.914 --> 26:59.537
okay, but he was a prince.

26:59.538 --> 27:03.412
So now it took about 40 of us
to fill up that... that void,

27:03.413 --> 27:05.579
including Dre and Nicole.

27:07.664 --> 27:09.829
I was frustrated
with the music business.

27:09.830 --> 27:12.537
I was frustrated that
I'd just got divorced.

27:12.538 --> 27:14.621
And I had no center.

27:14.622 --> 27:18.037
And whenever I get sad or I get scared

27:18.038 --> 27:19.954
or I get in trouble in any way,

27:19.955 --> 27:23.913
I wish I knew other therapeutic
ways of doing things.

27:23.914 --> 27:25.913
But the only thing I know how to do

27:25.914 --> 27:28.412
is completely bury myself,

27:28.413 --> 27:32.454
to a point of absurdity, into my work.

27:44.121 --> 27:47.079
I was here at my beach house,

27:47.080 --> 27:50.287
and I decided just to walk out
on the balcony to get some air,

27:50.288 --> 27:52.913
and Jimmy Iovine,
he was walkin' up the beach.

27:52.914 --> 27:55.496
"What's up?" He's like,
"Oh, I'm gonna come up."

27:55.497 --> 27:58.704
So he comes up the stairs.

27:58.705 --> 28:00.496
We have a sit-down right here.

28:05.038 --> 28:07.412
So we're just sittin' down,
shootin' the shit,

28:07.413 --> 28:10.120
and I told him about my lawyer
approachin' me about...

28:10.121 --> 28:12.371
There's a sneaker company that
wants you to endorse something.

28:12.372 --> 28:15.621
And I'm like, "Man, listen,
I don't know anything about fashion

28:15.622 --> 28:16.829
or anything like that."

28:16.830 --> 28:20.871
Andre put his name on two
solo albums in two decades.

28:20.872 --> 28:23.037
He treated products the same way.

28:23.038 --> 28:25.537
He turned down dozens of endorsements.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.954
You ask Dre to do somethin' like that,

28:27.955 --> 28:30.913
his first response is no.

28:30.914 --> 28:32.454
- No, no, no.
- No!

28:32.455 --> 28:33.537
Then he breathes.

28:33.538 --> 28:35.537
Hell, no! I wear the same shit everyday.

28:35.538 --> 28:37.454
You know? I wear the same
sneakers every day.

28:37.455 --> 28:39.204
So, I'm tellin' Jimmy this story,

28:39.205 --> 28:42.037
and out of the blue, he's like,
"Dre, man, fuck sneakers."

28:42.038 --> 28:43.995
No, you don't sell sneakers, you sell...

28:43.996 --> 28:45.829
- Speakers.
- Fuck sneakers.

28:45.830 --> 28:46.871
You should do speakers.

28:46.872 --> 28:49.663
All kinds of different speakers.

28:49.664 --> 28:51.663
Speakers and headphones.

28:51.664 --> 28:53.412
And he said, "We can do that?"

28:53.413 --> 28:55.454
I said, "We can absolutely do that."

28:55.455 --> 28:58.995
And I'm like, "Yeah, you know
what, we could call it Beats."

28:58.996 --> 29:00.746
He's like, "That's it,"

29:00.747 --> 29:02.704
and he just got up and left.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.913
I think from the moment he walked up

29:08.914 --> 29:10.329
to the moment he left,

29:10.330 --> 29:12.954
maybe ten minutes.

29:12.955 --> 29:15.579
A few days later,
he calls me up to his office.

29:15.580 --> 29:16.954
Next thing you know, I'm sittin' there,

29:16.955 --> 29:19.037
lookin' at a hundred different
pairs of headphones

29:19.038 --> 29:22.371
with all these designs,
and that's when I knew,

29:22.372 --> 29:24.954
"Okay, we're really doing this."

29:28.080 --> 29:31.204
We realized that all
headphones sounded boring

29:31.205 --> 29:32.871
and looked like medical equipment.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.746
Man, they ugly as fuck.

29:34.747 --> 29:37.371
We wanted more bass in these headphones

29:37.372 --> 29:40.329
to exaggerate all of it.

29:40.330 --> 29:42.621
We wanted to put it on steroids.

29:42.622 --> 29:44.537
The Bose headphones...

29:44.538 --> 29:47.162
they were advertising noise canceling,

29:47.163 --> 29:48.245
total quiet.

29:48.246 --> 29:51.037
Jimmy says, "Noise canceling?"

29:52.538 --> 29:54.371
Yeah, they're the headphones

29:54.372 --> 29:57.496
if you want to go to sleep on a plane.

29:57.497 --> 30:00.371
Our headphones are the
"Where's the party?" headphones.

30:05.705 --> 30:07.371
So we found Robert Brunner,

30:07.372 --> 30:08.663
this incredible designer,

30:08.664 --> 30:10.621
and we also hooked up with Monster,

30:10.622 --> 30:12.245
which was owned by Noel Lee,

30:12.246 --> 30:13.621
who's an audio engineer.

30:13.622 --> 30:15.162
I went to Steve Jobs,
and I said, "Steve,

30:15.163 --> 30:17.579
I wanna make a headphone with Dr. Dre."

30:17.580 --> 30:19.746
He said, "Well, Jimmy, you
can get killed in hardware.

30:19.747 --> 30:22.287
It's not as easy as it looks."

30:22.288 --> 30:23.829
It's a different kind of business.

30:23.830 --> 30:25.746
We had to learn to be
a complete sandwich shop.

30:25.747 --> 30:27.329
We couldn't just come up
with the recipe.

30:27.330 --> 30:28.995
We had to actually cut the pastrami.

30:28.996 --> 30:32.245
Everyone felt we weren't
gonna be able to sell headphones

30:32.246 --> 30:34.454
'cause they were given away
for free with all the phones.

30:34.455 --> 30:37.663
But I figured, if we can get
them on the right musicians,

30:37.664 --> 30:39.496
then kids will try 'em.

30:39.497 --> 30:40.913
And once they hear them,

30:40.914 --> 30:44.079
I know they'll never go back
to somethin' that sounds crappy.

30:45.538 --> 30:47.120
So everywhere I'd go,

30:47.121 --> 30:49.788
I'd put the headphones on
people and I'd take a picture.

30:49.789 --> 30:51.079
You walked in his office,

30:51.080 --> 30:52.871
you were getting hit with a flash.

30:52.872 --> 30:54.829
It was the constant,
"What do you think of these?

30:54.830 --> 30:56.245
What do you think of these?"

30:56.246 --> 30:58.204
I got to be obsessive about it.

30:58.205 --> 31:00.412
You was not gettin' outta that office

31:00.413 --> 31:01.954
unless Jimmy could take a picture.

31:01.955 --> 31:03.204
Click, click, click.

31:03.205 --> 31:06.245
And if you refused to put
the Beats in your videos...

31:06.246 --> 31:08.829

31:17.330 --> 31:20.037
Once we made it hip,
it was a fashion statement.

31:20.038 --> 31:21.162
It was like the hood thing.

31:21.163 --> 31:22.621
It was like, "This is what we do."

31:22.622 --> 31:26.287
But Jimmy and Dre created
this thing out of nothing.

31:26.288 --> 31:30.829
"Hey! You guys wanna
wear Dre's headphones?

31:30.830 --> 31:32.995
"Dre loves you.
He's gonna send you some.

my office with brown hair,

31:59.996 --> 32:01.579
Italian girl from New York,

32:01.580 --> 32:04.412
and started tellin' me
about Andy Warhol and...

32:04.413 --> 32:07.371
dance music, but yet, industrial,

32:07.372 --> 32:08.995
and paintings.

32:08.996 --> 32:11.663
And I don't know. She confused me so
much that I signed her, you know.

32:12.914 --> 32:14.537
No one at Interscope
in the executive level

32:14.538 --> 32:16.829
believed that Gaga could
be as big as it could be.

32:16.830 --> 32:20.371
It felt still like house
music, dance music, disco.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.454
But Jimmy said, "I was at
a club with Timbaland,

32:22.455 --> 32:24.079
"and I saw the room move.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.704
"It felt like pop music.

32:25.705 --> 32:27.037

Beats and Lady Gaga both got transformed

32:56.747 --> 32:59.913
through music videos into relationships.

32:59.914 --> 33:01.412
Not around the culture,

33:01.413 --> 33:03.788
not over the culture,
but in the culture.

33:03.789 --> 33:05.496
- This is for you guys.
- What did you do?!

33:05.497 --> 33:07.329
- What are these?
- Beats by Dr. Dre.

33:07.330 --> 33:09.913
- What are these?
- They're the best headphones in the world.

33:09.914 --> 33:11.037
- Oh, you're kidding!
- Stop it!

33:11.038 --> 33:12.412
Yeah, I love them.

33:12.413 --> 33:14.412
They went from 27,000

33:14.413 --> 33:17.995
to 1,600,000 headphones in one year.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.537
We started with artists.
quickly moved to athletes,

33:20.538 --> 33:22.037
The marketing was natural.

33:22.038 --> 33:23.412
And athletes embraced Beats,

33:23.413 --> 33:26.913
because music is part
of the ritual of training.

33:26.914 --> 33:29.871
The 2008 Olympics in Beijing,

33:29.872 --> 33:31.954
there's the American basketball team

33:31.955 --> 33:34.537
coming off the plane in Beijing,

33:34.538 --> 33:35.871
wearing our headphones.

33:35.872 --> 33:40.162
When we saw the explosive
response to the LeBron thing,

33:40.163 --> 33:43.120
we started to realize
that this original vision

33:43.121 --> 33:44.913
of culture and product

33:44.914 --> 33:46.829
was happening before your very eyes.

33:46.830 --> 33:48.287
♪ She is gonna let nobody ♪

33:48.288 --> 33:49.788
We said, "Music's about identity.

33:49.789 --> 33:51.829
So let's make every country
have their own product."

33:51.830 --> 33:53.162
It's a big controversy.

33:53.163 --> 33:54.788
They're not supposed to wear anything

33:54.789 --> 33:56.579
that's not one of the official sponsors.

33:56.580 --> 33:58.537
And so now they want
the athletes to take them off.

33:58.538 --> 34:00.287
That should be a course at Harvard.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.204
I'm tellin' ya, it was so brilliant.

34:02.205 --> 34:04.204
The FIFA World Cup has banned players

34:04.205 --> 34:07.162
from using the popular
Dr. Dre headphones.

34:07.163 --> 34:09.286
The most popular selling headphones

34:09.288 --> 34:11.161
have been banned from the NFL.

34:11.163 --> 34:13.371
The speculation is Beats loves this.

34:13.371 --> 34:15.454
That's the purpose behind
Beats doing that, right?

34:15.455 --> 34:17.663
Now, no one's gonna
be able to do that again.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.161
That trick is done.

34:19.163 --> 34:20.954
Nobody's better at marketing than Jimmy.

34:20.955 --> 34:23.536
Nobody's better than that guy,
and just relentlessly.

34:23.538 --> 34:26.120
The only person that does it
better than him is me.

34:26.121 --> 34:27.579
He's got good instinct,

34:27.580 --> 34:30.079
and he is shameless, you know?

34:30.080 --> 34:32.704
They're like the Jordans of headphones.

34:32.705 --> 34:34.995
But fuck this Beats thing.

34:34.996 --> 34:37.329
Seriously, honestly,
fuck this Beats thing.

34:37.330 --> 34:38.788
- What?! Seriously?!
- That's... No, no, no.

34:38.789 --> 34:41.161
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you what I thought.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.371
This is absolutely what I thought.

34:43.371 --> 34:46.536
I was like, "Man...

34:46.538 --> 34:49.579
"I want Dre to make an album,

34:49.580 --> 34:53.788
and he's talking about
headphones right now."

34:53.789 --> 34:55.704
Hello. How you guys doin'?

34:55.705 --> 34:56.746
All right.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.788
I've been tuning speakers

34:59.789 --> 35:01.371
for my house and my studio

35:01.372 --> 35:03.746
and my car for over 25 years now,

35:03.747 --> 35:04.995
and I'm almost there.

35:04.996 --> 35:07.496
I think I've almost got it right.

35:07.497 --> 35:09.871
But a lot of people either don't care

35:09.872 --> 35:13.037
or just don't know about quality sound.

35:13.038 --> 35:14.371
And that's why we're here right now.

35:14.372 --> 35:16.746
We're here to do our part
to try to change that.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.371
You know, many years ago,

35:18.372 --> 35:20.954
he said, "I'm not a businessman,

35:20.955 --> 35:22.829
I'm a music man."

35:22.830 --> 35:27.271
But I would say that he
has grown in the business.

35:36.872 --> 35:38.871
This is Brentwood. Wouldn't you know,

35:38.872 --> 35:42.037
the house that I fell in love
with is in fuckin' Brentwood.

35:42.038 --> 35:43.704
This is the school right here.

35:43.705 --> 35:46.412
That was the school that
O.J. went to for the recital

35:46.413 --> 35:48.412
the day of the murders.

35:48.413 --> 35:49.454
It's crazy, huh?

35:49.455 --> 35:51.245
My neighbors are
gonna be like, "Ah, fuck.

35:51.246 --> 35:53.037
"Another black guy's
movin' to the neighborhood.

35:53.038 --> 35:54.287

should call this place Folsom.

36:03.789 --> 36:06.120
This is it. This is the last
place we're ever gonna live,

36:06.121 --> 36:08.413
so, we're trying to make it perfect.

36:10.163 --> 36:11.789
Yeah, yeah.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.622
And the studio's down there.

36:18.121 --> 36:19.622
So, yeah, this is the control room.

36:23.163 --> 36:25.871
Mic booth, which I don't know
what I'm gonna do with this,

36:25.872 --> 36:28.621
because I hardly ever
use a mic booth anymore.

36:28.622 --> 36:30.871
There's a certain intimacy
that goes on with the artist

36:30.872 --> 36:32.329
when you can reach out and touch 'em

36:32.330 --> 36:34.454
and there's not a glass separating you.
You know what I mean?

36:34.455 --> 36:37.704
So I prefer to do it where
everybody's in the same room.

36:37.705 --> 36:41.412
This is gonna be the first
studio that I've ever been in

36:41.413 --> 36:42.704
that was perfect for me.

36:42.705 --> 36:45.162
I've never been in a studio
that was perfect

36:45.163 --> 36:47.038
and everything was right.

36:48.038 --> 36:49.995
This area is the master bathroom.

36:49.996 --> 36:52.454
He's an owner now.
He's in the owner's box.

36:52.455 --> 36:53.455
And when you become a owner,

36:53.456 --> 36:55.037
you have to become sort of distant

36:55.038 --> 36:57.245
and sort of... to the business

36:57.246 --> 37:00.497
and not so to the entertainment side.

37:09.330 --> 37:10.872
I didn't do it.

37:12.288 --> 37:13.913
I don't speed anymore.

37:18.418 --> 37:20.356
To Minneapolis now
and the potential battle

37:20.380 --> 37:23.803
brewing over Prince's
$300 million estate.

37:23.828 --> 37:25.203
Family members head into court tomorrow...

37:25.304 --> 37:27.788
When I was growin' up
musicians were superheroes.

37:27.789 --> 37:29.496
You didn't get to see them all the time.

37:29.497 --> 37:32.079
You read into what they did.
They were larger than life.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.537
And I'm not against change,

37:33.538 --> 37:35.829
but as music's kind of gotten
co-opted to something

37:35.830 --> 37:37.954
that isn't the primary attention thing,

37:37.955 --> 37:40.245
it's the thing that happens while
you're doing something else,

37:40.246 --> 37:42.496
and it's a way to sell you ads now.

37:42.497 --> 37:45.704
It's tough as a musician
not to feel a bit beat down.

37:45.705 --> 37:48.412
I don't know if Dre's vision
was like, "Jimmy's with this."

37:48.413 --> 37:51.037
But there would be some times
where we'd be shootin' a video

37:51.038 --> 37:52.371
till, like, 6:00 in the morning

37:52.372 --> 37:54.079
and we had to do one more take with me

37:54.080 --> 37:55.204
or somebody in the video

37:55.205 --> 37:56.913
wearin' some goddamn headphones.

37:56.914 --> 37:59.204
I'm like, "Man,
are you fuckin' kidding me?"

37:59.205 --> 38:01.162
Every time we did something,

38:01.163 --> 38:03.913
it was like, Jimmy with the Beats.

38:03.914 --> 38:05.371
And I remember thinking, like,

38:05.372 --> 38:07.412
"Why is this so important?"

38:07.413 --> 38:10.496
But I had no idea
what the Great Gazoo was doing.

38:10.497 --> 38:13.664
You doubt the power of the Great Gazoo?

38:15.705 --> 38:17.871
I knew he was frustrated.

38:17.872 --> 38:20.746
And Jimmy and my own interests align

38:20.747 --> 38:22.871
around some ideas that we think

38:22.872 --> 38:24.496
are pretty fucking good, you know,

38:24.497 --> 38:27.454
and could tick music up a notch again,

38:27.455 --> 38:28.704
make it important again.

38:28.705 --> 38:31.537
And that sounds pretentious,
and it is pretentious.

38:31.538 --> 38:32.913
But I think it's also...

38:32.914 --> 38:35.205
I think it's fuckin' feasible, you know.

38:36.330 --> 38:37.788
From 2003 on,

38:37.789 --> 38:39.663
I always wanted to be
in the streaming business,

38:39.664 --> 38:41.412
but I tried to get
other people to do it.

38:41.413 --> 38:42.746
I wanted Apple to do it.

38:42.747 --> 38:44.579
So I used to go to Eddy
and Steve all the time

38:44.580 --> 38:46.412
and say, "Let's do streaming."

38:46.413 --> 38:47.746
And they would say, "Too early."

38:47.747 --> 38:50.871
They just felt it wasn't right
for Apple at the time.

38:50.872 --> 38:52.704
So I said, "Man,
nobody's gonna do this for us.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.412
Let's do it ourselves."

38:54.413 --> 38:56.454
So we built Beats Music.

38:56.455 --> 38:57.913
It's not just the speaker.

38:57.914 --> 39:00.245
It's also, how do people consume music.

39:00.246 --> 39:02.079
And that's Jimmy's new thing.

39:02.080 --> 39:06.454
Changing the habits of people
from buying to accessing.

39:06.455 --> 39:09.162
And if there's anyone
who can do it, it's him,

39:09.163 --> 39:12.454
because of his reputation,
his connections.

39:12.455 --> 39:16.120
But Trent and I knew
that streaming could not scale

39:16.121 --> 39:18.788
without a company like Apple behind it.

39:18.789 --> 39:21.162
We made some headwinds, but the truth is

39:21.163 --> 39:22.954
we weren't sophisticated
enough, at least I wasn't,

39:22.955 --> 39:24.537
to understand technology
wasn't there yet.

39:24.538 --> 39:26.871
But Apple was a place

39:26.872 --> 39:28.954
we thought we could
really tie it all together

39:28.955 --> 39:31.204
with a culture that
we really could connect with.

39:31.205 --> 39:34.412
Beats Music doesn't
have the resources of an Apple

39:34.413 --> 39:36.704
and the 850 million credit cards

39:36.705 --> 39:39.079
and the $150 billion in the bank.

39:39.080 --> 39:43.120
So Jimmy's faced with, "Uh-oh.
I gotta make this thing work."

39:43.121 --> 39:44.579
Apple.

39:44.580 --> 39:46.329
The biggest company on Earth.

39:46.330 --> 39:49.704
They got more liquid money
than the American government.

39:49.705 --> 39:51.704
That's beyond ballin'.

39:51.705 --> 39:53.995
So now you gotta
look at it from both sides.

39:53.996 --> 39:57.037
Beats is a very profitable
headphone company,

39:57.038 --> 39:58.621
and it has marketing contracts

39:58.622 --> 40:01.371
with some of the finest musicians
and athletes in the world.

40:01.372 --> 40:04.537
Somethin'... you can't
spend no amount of money to create.

40:04.538 --> 40:06.079
Culture.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.954
Music.

40:07.955 --> 40:10.371
Content.

40:10.372 --> 40:12.537
And a relationship with hip-hop.

40:12.538 --> 40:16.162
Plus they got Jimmy Iovine
to bring that kind of marketing

40:16.163 --> 40:18.995
and insight to their
future success in music.

40:18.996 --> 40:20.454
Apple is music.

40:20.455 --> 40:22.995
The core of Apple is music.

40:22.996 --> 40:25.537
It's part of what drove
Steve and his company.

40:25.538 --> 40:27.162
And eventually, one day,

40:27.163 --> 40:28.663
Tim called me in with Eddy,

40:28.664 --> 40:31.372
and Tim said to me,
"You know what? We're ready."

40:33.622 --> 40:35.037
How about Dr. Dre?

40:35.038 --> 40:36.913
Hip-hop mogul, Dr. Dre,

40:36.914 --> 40:39.120
seeming to confirm the reported deal.

40:39.121 --> 40:41.995
A $3 billion deal to acquire Beats.

40:42.020 --> 40:44.144
The biggest deal in Apple's history.

40:44.145 --> 40:46.969
- This is great for Dr Dre.
- Oh, it's amazing.

40:46.970 --> 40:50.078
This is just about us
continuing to invest in music.

40:50.103 --> 40:53.174
And this is the first music
subscription service done right.

40:53.199 --> 40:54.862
Are you gonna really
leave the record industry?

40:54.894 --> 40:57.059
I did. I'm a retired record executive.

40:57.060 --> 40:58.393
That's me.

40:59.487 --> 41:04.042
I'm so excited, man.
The new beginning of my new life.

41:04.067 --> 41:05.358
You hear that?

41:05.359 --> 41:07.108
I clean up nice.

41:07.109 --> 41:10.066
Dr. Dre has been
my primary care physician

41:10.067 --> 41:11.691
for over 15 years.

41:11.692 --> 41:14.899
Jimmy Iovine has been that
little voice inside my head.

41:14.900 --> 41:16.483
Both guys from the streets

41:16.484 --> 41:18.400
who built everything they have today

41:18.401 --> 41:19.899
by betting on themselves.

41:19.900 --> 41:22.400
Doot, doot, doot, doot.
Hey, Mr. Big Stuff.

41:24.026 --> 41:26.733
I said, "I heard about
your little business venture,

41:26.734 --> 41:28.984
and I said, 'That boy is smart!'"

41:30.151 --> 41:32.151
He said, "Sometimes."

41:33.817 --> 41:35.026
Um...

41:36.177 --> 41:38.010
The journey isn't done yet.

41:38.011 --> 41:39.634
You promised Detox.

41:39.635 --> 41:42.427

any connection with it.

42:22.343 --> 42:23.593
It didn't work.

42:23.594 --> 42:26.259
I had to have a reason.

42:26.260 --> 42:28.968
I'm never gonna do that again.

42:28.969 --> 42:32.384
I wanna be inspired.

42:32.385 --> 42:35.551
I'm always gonna produce
and find young talent,

42:35.552 --> 42:38.759
but I'm 30 years in, I'm 50 years old.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.384
It's so fuckin' difficult,

42:40.385 --> 42:42.760
because makin' music
is a young man's game.

42:57.260 --> 42:59.217
Is it a young man's game?

42:59.218 --> 43:01.259
I mean, I was born in '87.

43:01.260 --> 43:02.718
I don't know where I'll be...

43:02.719 --> 43:05.426
15 years from now, but I know right now,

43:05.427 --> 43:08.260
when he say, "Young man's game,"
all I wanna do is write.

43:09.260 --> 43:10.759
The classic board.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.301
Chronic, The Marshall Mathers LP.

43:13.302 --> 43:15.259
I did half of Good Kid on here.

43:15.260 --> 43:18.135
I was nine years old
the first time I met Dre,

43:18.136 --> 43:19.467
first time I met 'Pac,

43:19.468 --> 43:21.426
and they was at the Compton
swap meet on Rosecrans.

43:21.427 --> 43:23.676
I was one of the kids out
there on my pop's shoulder,

43:23.677 --> 43:26.176
watchin' him go up and down my city,

43:26.177 --> 43:28.259
his city, rappin' these rap lyrics.

43:28.260 --> 43:30.593
Dre didn't know
he met me, but I met him.

43:30.594 --> 43:32.759
Fifteen years later, I was
in the studio with him.

43:32.760 --> 43:33.968
Poof!

43:33.969 --> 43:35.259
Blew my mind away.

43:35.260 --> 43:37.301
Oh, that's sick.

43:37.302 --> 43:39.467
Please welcome Kendrick Lamar.

43:41.635 --> 43:45.843
Believe that. N.W.A., man.

43:45.844 --> 43:48.010
It was dubbed gangsta rap, but for me,

43:48.011 --> 43:50.093
it was an intimate look at
what was actually happenin'

43:50.094 --> 43:51.885
in our community in Los Angeles,

43:51.886 --> 43:53.135
and in Compton in particular.

43:53.136 --> 43:54.759
♪ I can feel the changes ♪

43:54.760 --> 43:56.759
I feel like each and
every single one of them

43:56.760 --> 43:58.676
was black superheroes where I come from.

43:58.677 --> 44:00.968
Back then, we weren't
thinkin' about fame or fortune

44:00.969 --> 44:02.301
or anything like that.

44:02.302 --> 44:05.135
We were just some kids in the
studio havin' fun recording.

44:05.136 --> 44:07.676
And I'm quite sure, everybody
in the music industry,

44:07.677 --> 44:09.509
especially those that make music,

44:09.510 --> 44:12.093
understand how precious those times are.

44:12.094 --> 44:14.634
Recognizin' the moment,
just appreciatin' the moment,

44:14.635 --> 44:16.342
you know, that's
the hardest thing to do,

44:16.343 --> 44:18.010
especially in the music business.

44:18.011 --> 44:21.010
I think we just came up
with great ideas for retail.

44:21.011 --> 44:22.676
But here's the problem
with the messaging,

44:22.677 --> 44:25.342
no one knows what we're talking about.

44:25.343 --> 44:28.217
I have people that I hang out
with on the weekends

44:28.218 --> 44:30.301
that still don't use this thing.

44:30.302 --> 44:32.176
What are we gonna do to get people

44:32.177 --> 44:35.176
to come in to Apple Music and sign up?

44:35.177 --> 44:38.634
Just telling them,
"It's there" is not enough.

44:38.635 --> 44:40.551
We don't even know if advertising works.

44:40.552 --> 44:43.259
Whatever you gotta
do to make it connect,

44:43.260 --> 44:45.384
you gotta go for. And how you do that?

44:45.385 --> 44:48.135
Completely remove the motherfuckin' ego.

44:48.136 --> 44:50.509
Jimmy told me that, "Remove the ego."

44:50.510 --> 44:53.051
And by the way, I don't
know how to figure it out.

44:53.052 --> 44:55.593
When he first started
in the business he said,

44:55.594 --> 44:57.010
"I'm gonna make a killing.

44:57.011 --> 44:58.718
I'm retiring at 40."

44:58.719 --> 45:01.384
Then he said, "Around 50."

45:01.385 --> 45:03.217
That is so not him.

45:03.218 --> 45:05.010
He'll create something else.

45:09.719 --> 45:12.217
When we started Beats,
we tried to hire people,

45:12.218 --> 45:14.593
and we would get either engineers

45:14.594 --> 45:16.135
or people from the creative community.

45:16.136 --> 45:19.759
There weren't people that
understood both languages.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.342
I said to Dre,
"Why don't we start a school

45:22.343 --> 45:25.259
that teaches kids
how to combine all of it?"

45:25.260 --> 45:27.051
- Iovine Young Academy.
- There you go.

45:27.052 --> 45:28.801
We're on our site

45:28.802 --> 45:31.384
where they're gonna build our building

45:31.385 --> 45:32.843
for our school.

45:32.844 --> 45:35.093
And it ain't cheap.

45:43.886 --> 45:46.968
We didn't have nobody
puttin' money in our city.

45:46.969 --> 45:48.926
So to give back to the city of Compton,

45:48.927 --> 45:52.926
knowin' where we come from,
that is the ultimate goal.

45:52.927 --> 45:55.426
All he knew was just gangbangin',
you know what I'm sayin'?

45:55.427 --> 45:56.968
That's all there was.

45:56.969 --> 45:58.593
But we recognizin' our potential now.

45:58.594 --> 46:01.968
Recognizin' the gifts
that we have in the city,

46:01.969 --> 46:04.426
rather than just focusin'
on the negativity.

46:04.427 --> 46:06.426
But the gang culture is always there.

46:06.427 --> 46:08.177
I can't... I can't sugarcoat that.

46:12.052 --> 46:15.176
Me and Cube were out in Compton.

46:15.177 --> 46:16.926
Kendrick Lamar's there.

46:16.927 --> 46:18.718
Game is there.

46:18.719 --> 46:20.593
All of these people.

46:20.594 --> 46:22.467
We're tryin' to bring some love

46:22.468 --> 46:24.634
and some hope back to the city.

46:24.635 --> 46:25.843
We're talkin' about

46:25.844 --> 46:27.634
doin' some positive things for Compton.

46:27.635 --> 46:30.509
We're talkin' about puttin'
some money back into the city,

46:30.510 --> 46:32.217
bringin' the city up.

46:32.218 --> 46:34.093
And then this stupid-ass motherfucker

46:34.094 --> 46:35.843
comes through with the bullshit.

46:35.844 --> 46:38.135
Just jumped in his car

46:38.136 --> 46:41.676
and backed over
Terry Carter and killed him.

46:41.677 --> 46:43.551
This man died.

46:43.552 --> 46:46.010
This was a good brother.

46:46.011 --> 46:47.634
He had a wife. He had kids.

46:47.635 --> 46:48.968
He was responsible for takin' in,

46:48.969 --> 46:50.467
like, 12 foster kids.

46:50.468 --> 46:51.843
This is a good guy.

46:51.844 --> 46:54.093
And all of a sudden, boom,

46:54.094 --> 46:56.634
we got bad news all on TV,

46:56.635 --> 46:59.302
and Compton's lookin' fucked up again.

47:01.136 --> 47:02.509
Yeah.

47:02.510 --> 47:04.801
Yo, Suge, what was...
what was the fight about, man?

47:04.802 --> 47:07.342
Can you say anything about
the allegations against you?

47:13.260 --> 47:16.259
One of the biggest names
in rap music is in jail this morning.

47:16.260 --> 47:19.843
We've just learned, minutes ago, that
producer Suge Knight was arrested.

47:19.844 --> 47:22.093
He's being held on $2 million bail.

47:22.094 --> 47:23.801
He is a pioneer in his field,

47:23.802 --> 47:26.885
working with artists like M.C. Hammer,
Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur.

47:26.886 --> 47:29.176
But now, he could face murder charges

47:29.177 --> 47:30.509
after a deadly hit and run...

47:30.510 --> 47:32.301
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

47:32.302 --> 47:33.760
What's up, love?

47:35.594 --> 47:37.384
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

47:37.385 --> 47:38.885
I'm here at the beach.

47:38.886 --> 47:40.885
Right.

47:40.886 --> 47:42.885
About to do some recording upstairs.

47:42.886 --> 47:45.676
That sounds good. I love you.

47:45.677 --> 47:47.135
I love you, too, baby.

47:47.136 --> 47:48.302
All right.

48:00.052 --> 48:04.135
If he could tell
his whole story through music,

48:04.136 --> 48:08.259
he would rather that
than to have to talk about it.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.384
- That's cool?
- Check, yeah.

48:10.385 --> 48:11.885
Yeah, that's good.

48:11.886 --> 48:13.384
Check, check, check, yeah.

48:13.385 --> 48:14.426
That's money.

48:14.427 --> 48:17.718
I'm really wonderin' if...

48:19.094 --> 48:22.718

Yeah, that... that's definitely it.

50:24.594 --> 50:25.927
Let's listen.

50:27.343 --> 50:29.093
There's a lot more
to be done with the stacks

50:29.094 --> 50:30.843
and the ad libs and the verses and shit,

50:30.844 --> 50:33.551
but... I don't feel like
doing it right now.

50:33.552 --> 50:38.051
I just wanna live with it
for a second and, um...

50:38.052 --> 50:40.551
wake up and see if I...

50:40.552 --> 50:43.551
see if I'm in love
with what happened tonight.

50:43.552 --> 50:45.135
You know.

50:45.136 --> 50:46.759
Then we'll go from there.

50:56.719 --> 50:58.926
We've been together 21 years,

50:58.927 --> 51:01.259
so we know each other.

51:01.260 --> 51:04.051
I'm the kite and she's the rock.

51:11.302 --> 51:14.301
When I was younger,
I was scared to death.

51:14.302 --> 51:17.093
I didn't know where
my life was gonna go.

51:17.094 --> 51:19.759
And then I met Roy Cicala
and John Lennon

51:19.760 --> 51:21.051
and they gave me a shot.

51:21.052 --> 51:22.968
And then I worked with Bruce and Patti.

51:22.969 --> 51:25.593
And that was my college education.

51:25.594 --> 51:26.885
And I felt freedom.

51:26.886 --> 51:30.467
I said, "Okay, I'm free
from what I don't know."

51:30.468 --> 51:33.676
In 2012, yeah, I was successful,

51:33.677 --> 51:35.093
but I was alone.

51:35.094 --> 51:37.301
I was scared again.

51:37.302 --> 51:38.593
And then I met Liberty,

51:38.594 --> 51:42.467
and I got that same
feeling of direction,

51:42.468 --> 51:44.968
and I felt freedom again.

51:47.427 --> 51:49.384
To be soulmate?

51:49.385 --> 51:50.634
Yes.

51:50.635 --> 51:52.634
Liberty was a Jimmy Whisperer.

51:52.635 --> 51:56.885
She made him stand up
on both feet and be mature.

51:56.886 --> 52:00.718
Everybody, give it up for
Jimmy and Liberty Iovine.

52:03.886 --> 52:07.217
Now, y'all know that this
is the blackest wedding...

52:08.468 --> 52:12.551
that a white Italian man
with a rabbi has ever had in LA.

52:14.052 --> 52:15.301
And we about to party,

52:15.302 --> 52:16.718
so meet us on the dance floor.

52:16.719 --> 52:20.301
Let's give it up for
Jimmy and Liberty Iovine.

52:20.302 --> 52:21.593
Whoo!

52:37.302 --> 52:41.426
Jimmy is one of the two
or three greatest inventors

52:41.427 --> 52:43.968
that I have known.

52:43.969 --> 52:46.676
But what was his invention?

52:46.677 --> 52:49.968
His invention was Jimmy Iovine.

52:49.969 --> 52:51.176
There's only one of him.

52:51.177 --> 52:53.426
That's the melody, man.

52:53.427 --> 52:55.176
I didn't even think about doing that.

52:55.177 --> 52:58.093
The innovator and the levitator.

52:58.094 --> 53:00.968
But Jimmy Iovine is the levitator.

53:00.969 --> 53:02.593
Dre is the innovator.

53:02.594 --> 53:05.176
Dr. Dre's releasing his first new album

53:05.177 --> 53:06.843
in more than 15 years.

53:06.844 --> 53:08.342
♪ I'm just, I'm just, I'm just ♪

53:08.343 --> 53:10.301
♪ I'm just talkin'
to my diary, I'm just ♪

53:10.302 --> 53:13.217
It's inspired by the
movie Straight Outta Compton.

53:13.218 --> 53:15.176
Dr. Dre also revealed
that he has shelved

53:15.177 --> 53:17.926
his long-awaited album, Detox.

53:17.927 --> 53:20.118
This is fuckin' insane, man.

53:21.886 --> 53:24.301
Take a look at Compton
High School while you still can.

53:24.302 --> 53:26.718
The plan is to tear it
to the ground and rebuild it,

53:26.719 --> 53:29.093
including a new performing arts center,

53:29.094 --> 53:30.885
paid in part by Dr. Dre.

53:33.677 --> 53:35.467
We have some really
exciting things planned

53:35.468 --> 53:36.801
for Compton High in the future,

53:36.802 --> 53:38.051
and I just wanted to stop by and say

53:38.052 --> 53:39.593
congratulations to you all.

53:39.594 --> 53:43.135
Residents passed a
$350 million bond measure

53:43.136 --> 53:44.885
to rebuild the entire complex,

53:44.886 --> 53:47.759
and Dre, who has helped
the district out in the past,

53:47.760 --> 53:49.593
is helping out once again.

53:49.594 --> 53:52.384
We're talking about
transforming a community

53:52.385 --> 53:55.718
that's been starved
economically for years.

53:55.719 --> 53:58.217
And we have not seen a new high school

53:58.218 --> 53:59.718
in well over a hundred years.

53:59.719 --> 54:03.426
And the new performing
arts center is on that end.

54:03.427 --> 54:05.593
We really wanted to put that

54:05.594 --> 54:08.634
in a very prominent
position in the community,

54:08.635 --> 54:10.426
right on a major thoroughfare.

54:10.427 --> 54:12.926
This facility will be
available to the community,

54:12.927 --> 54:14.467
weekdays, as well as weekends,

54:14.468 --> 54:17.843
as much as it wants,
and needs to be used.

54:17.844 --> 54:20.509
I was terrible in high school.
I struggled. I didn't like it.

54:20.510 --> 54:22.843
You know what I mean?
I didn't feel comfortable.

54:22.844 --> 54:25.467
You know? How many kids
are excited to go to school?

54:25.468 --> 54:27.051
None where I'm from.

54:27.052 --> 54:28.509
It's really important to have a place

54:28.510 --> 54:30.634
where kids are actually excited to go.

54:30.635 --> 54:32.634
A community of like-minded people

54:32.635 --> 54:35.759
that are just out to create
and learn how to create.

54:35.760 --> 54:37.093
And hopefully, it can take away

54:37.094 --> 54:39.801
some of the negative stereotypes
of Compton, you know,

54:39.802 --> 54:43.426
that, you know, in a funny way,
I feel like I was a part of.

54:43.427 --> 54:45.551
Now, we're just not
focusin' on the streets.

54:45.552 --> 54:47.801
We focusin' on music.
We focusin' on books.

54:47.802 --> 54:50.844
And we talkin' about
a dude from our city.

54:52.343 --> 54:55.135
That gives everybody hope.
I don't care what you're doin'.

54:58.260 --> 55:00.634
If I had had a crystal ball,

55:00.635 --> 55:04.509
when I was 15 and Andre was born,

55:04.510 --> 55:08.926
and I was searchin' for nickels
and dimes between cushions,

55:08.927 --> 55:12.135
cryin' because I didn't know
how I was gonna make a meal,

55:12.136 --> 55:14.801
this little chubby baby

55:14.802 --> 55:17.759
started pullin' hisself up
at nine months old.

55:17.760 --> 55:21.135
And he let go and he took off.

55:21.136 --> 55:25.176
And I go back and I start
thinkin' about all the steps.

55:25.177 --> 55:27.177
You know, who would've thought?

55:28.510 --> 55:31.509
Everybody understands the story of,

55:31.510 --> 55:33.301
"I got nothin'...

55:33.302 --> 55:35.051
and I want somethin'."

55:35.052 --> 55:36.467
Crazy.

55:36.468 --> 55:39.759
You know, that's what
it was and that's what it is.

55:39.760 --> 55:40.724
Ooh!

55:40.749 --> 55:42.115
If you want to accomplish

55:42.140 --> 55:45.765
something that hasn't been accomplished,

55:46.094 --> 55:49.342
you have to be relentlessly

55:49.343 --> 55:52.467
and unapologetically determined.

55:52.468 --> 55:54.551
Be true to yourself.

55:54.552 --> 55:57.135
Be true to your art.
Never take it for granted.

55:57.136 --> 55:59.176
You don't have to conform.

55:59.177 --> 56:01.176
You can be as raw as you need to be.

56:01.177 --> 56:02.801
Don't ever change who you are.

56:02.802 --> 56:04.176
You can't please everybody.

56:04.177 --> 56:05.843
Deliver quality.

56:05.844 --> 56:07.634
Do more. Do more.

56:07.635 --> 56:08.718
You are the underdog.

56:08.719 --> 56:10.467
Do it again, do it again, do it again.

56:10.468 --> 56:12.885
Stay in the fucking saddle.

56:12.886 --> 56:14.885
Treat everything like
it's your first opportunity.

56:14.886 --> 56:17.010
- Quit fuckin' around.
- And that's it. Don't forget that.

56:18.468 --> 56:20.217
- Go.
- My pleasure.

56:20.218 --> 56:22.384
- That is a wrap.
- Come on, let's have some lunch.

56:22.385 --> 56:24.718
Cool. I hope you guys got something.

56:24.719 --> 56:25.844
- Cool.
- Cool.

56:28.011 --> 56:29.302

- Yeah!
