00:02.620 --> 00:03.928
-I'|| give you things
your government

00:03.930 --> 00:05.739
hasn't even dreamed of.

00:05.740 --> 00:06.991
I'll put you on the ARPANET.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.319
This you don't have
in the Soviet Union.

00:24.510 --> 00:26.876
-No one else knows that
you're running her.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.006
Not yet.

00:28.010 --> 00:29.489
-What is it you want?

00:29.490 --> 00:33.119
-The FBI surveillance
logs that pertain to me.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.773
Who follows me, where, and when.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.259
-Oleg says he's in
this for himself,

00:39.270 --> 00:41.443
and I believe there's a good
chance that might be true.

00:41.450 --> 00:45.034
But I need you to do
something for me first.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.155
-Anything.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.196
-I need you to take a polygraph.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.929
-I would never betray you!

01:53.960 --> 01:59.409
-Y_ou look like a_
spy In an old mowe.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.059
-It's supposed to snow.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.288
-Weather isn't _
always accommodating.

02:03.300 --> 02:03.994
So?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.446
You've got something for me?

02:08.450 --> 02:09.144
-Yes.

02:09.150 --> 02:09.866
Sorry.

02:09.870 --> 02:12.054
The Centre has
instructed me to instruct

02:12.060 --> 02:13.425
you to bug the ARPANET.

02:13.430 --> 02:14.294
-The ARPAN ET?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.267
The scientist mentioned that.

02:15.270 --> 02:15.964
What is it?

02:15.970 --> 02:19.076
-It's an_ advanced
processmg system.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.308
It has to do with computers.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.173
It's all in here.

02:24.230 --> 02:26.061
This is the bug.

02:26.070 --> 02:28.209
Once you've attached
it to the thing,

02:28.220 --> 02:30.211
it takes 30 seconds to transfer.

02:30.220 --> 02:31.118
-Transfer what?

02:31.130 --> 02:34.793
-The information on
the computer system.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.392
-A bug the size of a rat?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.094
-Yeah.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.453
It's a big bug.

02:38.460 --> 02:41.952
Once the information's
copied, detach It.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.871
-And what will the rat tell us?

02:43.880 --> 02:45.871
-I can't say.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.043
-You can't say because you don't
know, or because you can't say?

02:49.050 --> 02:49.926
-I don't know.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.306
-Right.

02:51.310 --> 02:52.982
Where the cheese
is, most likely.

02:57.770 --> 02:58.964
-Any other questions?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.665
-I think you've
answered them all.

03:00.670 --> 03:03.685
-Technology's not
my strong suit.

03:03.690 --> 03:04.634
-Apparently not.

03:08.900 --> 03:12.267
-I'm sorry you have to
work with Captain Larrick.

03:12.270 --> 03:13.407
He's dangerous
and unpredictable,

03:13.410 --> 03:17.517
and puts you and
your family at risk.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.908
If it were up to me, I would--

03:18.910 --> 03:20.559
-It's not.

03:20.570 --> 03:22.049
It's not up to you.

03:22.050 --> 03:22.744
-No.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.709
Good luck.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.324
-Ready to go?

04:13.330 --> 04:14.024
-Yup.

04:14.030 --> 04:14.815
All set.

04:14.820 --> 04:15.514
Henry?

04:18.500 --> 04:20.764
-Put her in the car.

04:20.770 --> 04:21.464
All right, Bud.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.311
Get her in the car.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.014
Henry!

04:43.850 --> 04:45.659
-They're expecting me
at the Rezidentura.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.945
I've only a minute.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.827
-OK.

04:49.830 --> 04:50.728
-I'll take the test.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.803
-What changed?

04:54.810 --> 04:55.970
-Nothing.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.585
Nothing changed.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.546
I love you, and if you
don't know that by now,

05:00.550 --> 05:03.804
more is the pity.

05:03.810 --> 05:06.870
You'll have your proof.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.450
-When?

05:08.460 --> 05:09.154
-When you say.

05:11.860 --> 05:12.554
-Tonight, then.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.690
-Ah !

06:24.700 --> 06:25.587
Christ, man!

06:25.590 --> 06:26.420
What the hell?

06:26.430 --> 06:27.920
-You're a fall down
drunk, Charles.

06:27.930 --> 06:28.862
You've lost your grip!

06:28.870 --> 06:29.780
-Get off me!

06:29.790 --> 06:31.439
-Are you listening to me?
Am I getting through to you?

06:31.450 --> 06:32.144
-Yes!

06:32.150 --> 06:33.242
Please, no more!

06:39.790 --> 06:42.475
-My father was a journalist.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.174
And yours?

06:47.420 --> 06:48.239
-He was a worker.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.567
-What did he do?

06:54.790 --> 06:56.496
-He was a miner.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.047
Coal.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.119
More coffee?

06:59.120 --> 07:02.066
-Thank you.

07:02.070 --> 07:02.843
And you?

07:02.850 --> 07:03.544
-No thank you.

07:09.450 --> 07:11.964
Where does he live, your father?

07:11.970 --> 07:12.664
-He's dead.

07:15.890 --> 07:16.675
-How did he die?

07:19.490 --> 07:23.688
-One day he went to
work, he never came home.

07:23.690 --> 07:25.863
His newspaper was shuttered.

07:25.870 --> 07:28.213
There was no record
of his arrest.

07:28.220 --> 07:33.340
Nobody we could mourn or bury.

07:33.340 --> 07:34.989
We knew his fate.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.718
It was the same
fate of so many who

07:36.720 --> 07:40.554
dared to stand up
against Somoza.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.516
-You saw Larrick?

07:42.520 --> 07:43.214
-Yes.

07:43.220 --> 07:45.450
Why?

07:45.460 --> 07:47.519
-Captain Larrick is well
known to my service.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.920
He was giving a talk at
the Heritage Foundation

07:49.930 --> 07:52.660
on my country, and I wanted
to hear what he had to say.

07:52.670 --> 07:53.841
-And what did he have to say?

07:53.850 --> 07:56.523
-That Nicaragua
is the spear point

07:56.530 --> 07:58.589
for Soviet domination in
the Western hemisphere.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.149
-And did he see you?

08:03.160 --> 08:04.081
-No.

08:04.090 --> 08:04.909
You sure?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.704
-I was just a face among many.

08:09.710 --> 08:11.029
Nothing more.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.440
-Larrick is extremely dangerous.

08:13.450 --> 08:16.157
-I'm sure.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.048
-Two contra fiel_d
commanders WIII

08:18.060 --> 08:20.654
be at a training camp in
Virginia a week from today.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.104
-How will we get in?

08:22.110 --> 08:25.238
-Larrick will provide you with
identification and clearance.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.720
The special Naw forces
being sent into Nicaragua

08:27.730 --> 08:30.494
are schooled in Spanish,
language and culture.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.934
He'll get you through the
gate house as an instructor.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.089
Drive you onto the base.

08:37.340 --> 08:40.286
Chain link fence
surrounds the property.

08:40.290 --> 08:41.109
It's electrified.

08:41.110 --> 08:42.839
The on/off switch is here.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.263
At the appointed time, you
will deactivate the current.

08:45.270 --> 08:46.817
We'll cut through the fence.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.390
-Why not just go in
the trunk of a car?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.766
-They inspect the
cars coming in.

08:50.770 --> 08:52.726
-What about Larrick?

08:52.730 --> 08:53.515
-What about him?

08:53.520 --> 08:55.909
-Where will he be?

08:55.910 --> 08:56.604
-He will be here.

09:08.740 --> 09:09.593
English.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.897
Your test will be in English.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.140
What is it for?

09:12.150 --> 09:13.219
-To measure your breathing rate.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.398
To record the sweating
of your palms.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.278
-To calculate my blood
pressure and pulse.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.487
-All linked to a sensor
that records the indicators

09:25.490 --> 09:27.742
of stress with the ink line
on the cylinder of paper.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.827
How do you feel?

09:36.830 --> 09:38.661
-Like a criminal about
to be put to death.

09:42.250 --> 09:46.528
-That's the point-- to
induce the anxiety and fear.

09:46.530 --> 09:48.907
All the questions are
answered yes or no.

09:48.910 --> 09:50.047
That man is the polygrapher.

09:50.050 --> 09:52.291
He asks all the questions.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.983
But I'll do it this time.

09:53.990 --> 09:54.979
-Why?

09:54.980 --> 09:57.835
-His English is not so good.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.489
At some point during
your interrogation,

09:59.490 --> 10:01.913
he might suggest there
was a-- a problem.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.558
-What kind of problem?

10:03.560 --> 10:05.039
An ambiguity with
one of your answers.

10:05.050 --> 10:08.030
It's a-- a technique they use.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.632
You will be asked
if you know anything

10:09.640 --> 10:12.962
that might clear
up the confusion.

10:12.970 --> 10:13.902
-What should I say?

10:13.910 --> 10:14.604
-Say no.

10:17.650 --> 10:18.344
Shall we begin?

10:28.010 --> 10:29.819
Is your name Nina
Sergeevna Krylova?

10:29.820 --> 10:31.105
-Yes.

10:31.110 --> 10:32.668
-Do you live and work
at the Soviet Embassy?

10:32.680 --> 10:33.374
-Yes.

10:36.450 --> 10:39.669
-Do you trust me,
Nina Sergeevna?

10:39.680 --> 10:40.374
-No.

10:47.660 --> 10:48.354
-Good.

11:02.110 --> 11:04.021
-The painters want to know
whether you prefer eggshell

11:04.030 --> 11:06.555
or ivory on the wainscoting
in the outer office.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.255
-What's the difference?

11:08.260 --> 11:09.045
-The color.

11:13.190 --> 11:15.579
-Larrick wants to meet.

11:15.580 --> 11:16.274
-Why?

11:16.280 --> 11:19.465
-To talk about the mission.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.335
-Could be a play.

11:21.340 --> 11:24.264
He may not have murdered Emmett
and Leanne, but he wanted to.

11:24.270 --> 11:26.818
-Keep a tiger as a pet,
it's still a tiger.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.708
-I'll take the meeting.

11:28.710 --> 11:29.859
We'll do it in a public place.

11:29.870 --> 11:30.564
-No.

11:30.570 --> 11:31.787
I'll do it.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.566
You're the better shot.

11:34.570 --> 11:35.696
So this, um,

11:35.700 --> 11:37.804
this article that you're
working on, Mr. Emory--

11:37.810 --> 11:38.504
-Yes.

11:38.510 --> 11:40.228
It's-- it's about technology.

11:40.230 --> 11:42.027
-Well, you-- you've certainly
come to the right place.

11:42.030 --> 11:44.248
I'm-- I'm sure that--
that Charles has filled

11:44.260 --> 11:46.182
you in on-- on what we do here?

11:46.190 --> 11:47.589
-Don't have the wattage, Thane.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.465
I thought it best to
leave that to you.

11:49.470 --> 11:50.311
-Oh.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.014
All right.

11:51.020 --> 11:54.410
Well, um, I work on advanced
packet switching data systems--

11:54.420 --> 11:58.618
a single communications link
that collects information

11:58.620 --> 12:00.702
into datagrams,
and then transmits

12:00.710 --> 12:03.281
them on to an attached network.

12:03.290 --> 12:07.283
Um, sort of like a
handshake that introduces

12:07.290 --> 12:10.270
distant computers to each
other in virtual space.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.653
-Virtual space?

12:16.660 --> 12:19.515
-Uh, you're familiar
with the post office?

12:19.520 --> 12:20.214
-Sure.

12:20.220 --> 12:20.629
-Yes.

12:20.630 --> 12:21.324
-OK.

12:21.330 --> 12:26.450
So let's say that you have a-- a
friend in Japan named Hirohito.

12:26.450 --> 12:31.137
And Hirohito lives in
a tiny remote fishing

12:31.140 --> 12:32.994
village in Japan.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.992
And he wants to send
you a post card.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.605
But Hirohito only
knows Japanese.

12:40.820 --> 12:44.563
So he sends his postcard to
the Japanese post office, which

12:44.570 --> 12:48.461
translates the postcard into a
universal post office language.

12:48.470 --> 12:49.641
-A code.

12:49.650 --> 12:50.344
-A-- a code.

12:50.350 --> 12:51.044
Exactly.

12:51.050 --> 12:53.257
-And is the post
office in Japan?

12:53.260 --> 12:58.766
-Uh, Japan, Johannesburg,
Bangkok, Rio.

12:58.770 --> 13:00.044
Aanhere and everywhere.

13:00.050 --> 13:02.564
It's sort of like--
like God, you know,

13:02.570 --> 13:04.299
except without the,
um, the big beard

13:04.300 --> 13:05.972
and the flowing white robes.

13:05.980 --> 13:08.676
But, unlike the
Japanese post office,

13:08.680 --> 13:13.435
which is, of course,
in Japan, God resides--

13:13.440 --> 13:14.145
---in Heaven.

13:14.150 --> 13:14.844
-In Heaven.

13:14.850 --> 13:22.495
Exactly and Heaven, as we
all know, is-- the PDP-10.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.879
Or as we affectionately
refer to it as, The Beast.

13:25.880 --> 13:29.737
Can run multiple operating
systems-- TENEX, TYMCOM-X, ITS,

13:29.740 --> 13:31.924
WAITS, TOPS-20, et
cetera et cetera,

13:31.930 --> 13:33.830
et cetera, simultaneously.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.467
-And that's where what happens?

13:35.470 --> 13:37.085
-Creation.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.227
OK, but not quite.

13:38.230 --> 13:41.631
Um, the information
generated by The Beast

13:41.640 --> 13:43.949
still needs to be
disseminated, OK?

13:43.960 --> 13:46.565
Sort of like-- like
pollen in the wind.

13:46.570 --> 13:49.789
And that happens,
well, in another room.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.031
Think of The Beast as
your disembodied brain.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.498
The machine that services
your braIn, that translates

13:56.500 --> 14:00.971
a postcard written in any one of
the 116 languages known to man

14:00.980 --> 14:04.916
_ into a universal code _
Instantaneously that allows It

14:04.920 --> 14:08.321
to share its thoughts and
feelings across a vast network

14:08.330 --> 14:10.798
as large as, potentially,
the universe itself,

14:10.810 --> 14:13.882
that keeps it
communicative lives here.

14:13.890 --> 14:16.279
The Interface Message Processor.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.690
We have our very own IMP.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.816
It is, in
a manner of speaking,

14:19.820 --> 14:22.562
the interstate highway
system through which

14:22.570 --> 14:24.151
all information flows.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.661
-What kind of information?

14:25.670 --> 14:28.116
-Anything and everything
shared on the network.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.303
-And who's on the network?

14:29.310 --> 14:33.292
-Scientists and mathematicians,
universities, the military.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.382
-The military and
scientific community

14:35.390 --> 14:37.017
share the same network?

14:37.020 --> 14:37.805
-For now.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.132
-So the IMP is
like a traffic cop?

14:41.140 --> 14:44.291
-Traffic cop,
facilitator, translator,

14:44.300 --> 14:48.430
keeping information moving
with no snafus, no tie-ups,

14:48.440 --> 14:52.797
on an endless ribbon
of virtual highway.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.825
-Going where?

14:54.830 --> 14:55.694
-To the future.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.424
Are you a KGB
officer, Nina Sergeevna?

15:01.430 --> 15:03.489
-Yes.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.831
-Have you been
providing information

15:04.840 --> 15:08.173
about Stan Beeman to the KGB?

15:08.180 --> 15:08.874
-No.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.878
-Have you been truthful with me?

15:16.890 --> 15:17.584
-Yes.

15:29.690 --> 15:30.600
-How are you doing?

15:30.610 --> 15:31.326
-I'm all right.

15:36.870 --> 15:43.184
-This machine is like a camera.

15:43.190 --> 15:46.273
If you smile, does a camera
know if you're happy?

15:46.280 --> 15:47.451
-No.

15:47.460 --> 15:47.619
-No.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.314
It doesn't.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.514
It-- it can't read
your thoughts.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.488
It has no brain.

15:51.490 --> 15:54.038
If you prefer, think of
it as a-- as an insect.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.598
A wasp.

15:55.610 --> 15:59.023
When a wasps lands on your
arm, you're afraid, no?

15:59.030 --> 16:01.203
You hold your breath and
you wait for it to fly off,

16:01.210 --> 16:03.098
and when it doesn't,
what do you do?

16:03.110 --> 16:04.338
You panic.

16:04.340 --> 16:07.138
And when you panic,
it stings you.

16:07.150 --> 16:08.913
Perhaps it stings you because
it can smell your fear,

16:08.920 --> 16:12.799
or perhaps it stings
because when you panicked,

16:12.800 --> 16:15.109
you frightened it.

16:15.110 --> 16:19.581
You're afraid, and
the wasp was afraid.

16:19.590 --> 16:20.625
Chicken and egg, eh?

16:24.520 --> 16:26.943
Do you know why the
asp killed Cleopatra?

16:29.600 --> 16:32.068
Because she moved.

16:32.070 --> 16:33.423
Do you understand?

16:33.430 --> 16:34.749
-I must not move.

16:34.750 --> 16:35.591
-Not inside, no.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.227
Inside, you must be still.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.470
-How do I do that?

16:38.480 --> 16:40.857
-You have to believe
what you say.

16:40.860 --> 16:41.622
You must commit to it.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.609
Embrace it.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.906
So in order for you
to trick this machine,

16:45.910 --> 16:47.502
this-- this wasp--

16:47.510 --> 16:49.512
-I must lie to myself.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.842
-You have to lie to
tell a greater truth.

16:52.850 --> 16:55.466
Now, let's start again.

16:55.470 --> 16:57.006
It's the end
of science fiction.

16:57.010 --> 16:57.692
Or the beginning.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.076
I don't know what
the hell it is.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.219
They're playing with reality
like it's Silly Putty.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.189
-I'm counting on you to get
us into that computer lab.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.189
-There's a key pad.

17:05.190 --> 17:09.638
I know where Rosenbloom
keeps the entry code.

17:09.650 --> 17:12.130
-I need you sober, Charles.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.426
-I'm dry as a witch's tit.

17:14.430 --> 17:15.704
Don't worry.

17:15.710 --> 17:16.608
I'm on the case.

17:16.620 --> 17:17.518
It's all under control.

17:21.430 --> 17:22.863
Have you been
providing information

17:22.870 --> 17:24.906
about Stan Beeman to the KGB?

17:24.910 --> 17:25.604
-No.

17:30.260 --> 17:31.113
I can do this.

17:31.120 --> 17:31.814
I can't!

17:31.820 --> 17:33.959
-Squeeze your anus.

17:33.970 --> 17:34.664
-What?

17:34.670 --> 17:36.956
-Squeeze your anus before
you answer the question.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.676
-Is this is a joke?

17:37.680 --> 17:38.374
-No.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.213
Have you been
providing information

17:45.220 --> 17:46.642
about Stan Beeman to the KGB?

17:49.590 --> 17:50.284
-No.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.539
It works?

17:56.550 --> 17:57.539
-It works.

18:30.190 --> 18:31.976
-There's been a change of plans.

18:31.980 --> 18:35.234
I'm not going to be at the
meet with the contra brass.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.049
-Why not?

18:37.050 --> 18:40.110
-I'm leaving for Nicaragua.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.621
-For how long?

18:41.630 --> 18:43.177
-Hard to say.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.579
Six months.

18:44.590 --> 18:47.536
Maybe longer.

18:47.540 --> 18:50.452
-What's the rush?

18:50.460 --> 18:52.599
-We're setting up a
contra base at the Selva

18:52.610 --> 18:54.760
Negra Cloud Forest.

18:54.770 --> 18:56.601
-What's there?

18:56.610 --> 18:58.475
-Butterflies.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.174
Monarchs.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.751
It's where they breed.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.728
-I'm sure the butterflies
will be happy to see you.

19:06.370 --> 19:07.826
-It's hard to reach.

19:07.830 --> 19:12.233
Only 120 kilometres
from Managua.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.605
-You building a
wildlife sanctuary?

19:16.350 --> 19:17.886
-We're gonna mine
Managua Harbour.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.274
-We'|l still need your
help getting onto the base.

19:29.090 --> 19:32.355
-Are you alone?

19:32.360 --> 19:33.054
-Why do you ask?

19:37.220 --> 19:38.573
-Can't be too careful nowadays.

19:41.470 --> 19:43.870
It's hard to feel safe anywhere.

19:46.790 --> 19:47.859
I'm surprised you came alone.

20:10.820 --> 20:11.741
-It's a dance.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.728
This.

20:17.730 --> 20:19.778
Question and answer.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.668
-Call and response.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.170
It's what they do
in negro churches.

20:23.180 --> 20:27.776
The preacher shouts out,
and, uh, the people respond.

20:27.780 --> 20:29.224
-You know about negro churches?

20:29.230 --> 20:30.447
-I like their music.

20:30.450 --> 20:34.295
Marvin Gaye, Curtis
Mayfield, Aretha.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.951
Gospel, rhythm blues,
all the old stuff.

21:34.890 --> 21:38.212
-We need a new plan.

21:38.220 --> 21:40.029
Larrick is leaving
for Nicaragua.

21:40.030 --> 21:40.849
-When?

21:40.850 --> 21:41.908
-Soon.

21:41.910 --> 21:44.322
But he'll help us gain
access to the site.

21:44.330 --> 21:45.285
-He won't be there?

21:45.290 --> 21:45.984
-No.

21:45.990 --> 21:47.218
-Larrick needs to be there.

21:47.230 --> 21:48.436
That's the point
of the whole plan.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.101
Hey!

21:50.110 --> 21:52.294
Do you know who he is?

21:52.300 --> 21:53.653
What he's done?

21:53.660 --> 21:55.173
Larrick is a monster.

21:55.180 --> 21:59.662
He is responsible for the deaths
of hundreds of my countrymen.

21:59.670 --> 22:01.501
He has to pay.

22:01.510 --> 22:03.353
-What are you saying?

22:03.360 --> 22:07.137
-I was going to kill him
when we got on the base.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.244
-Larrick is a huge
asset to our cause.

22:09.250 --> 22:09.989
-An asset?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.956
-The operation and
Larrick are bigger

22:11.960 --> 22:13.211
than your wish for revenge.

22:13.220 --> 22:16.769
-It is not a wish,
it's a debt-- a debt

22:16.770 --> 22:19.250
I owe to those he killed.

22:19.260 --> 22:21.148
-Listen to me, Lucia.

22:21.150 --> 22:23.653
I will only say this once.

22:23.660 --> 22:26.220
Larrick is a monster,
but he is our monster.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.642
Whatever he's done
is nothing to what

22:28.650 --> 22:31.699
he can and will do
for us In our cause.

22:31.710 --> 22:32.392
-Uh.

22:40.370 --> 22:42.258
Hey.

22:42.270 --> 22:43.407
What do you think of this baby?

22:43.410 --> 22:44.160
-I like it.

22:44.170 --> 22:49.130
-386 horsepower, four on the
floor, direct overhead cam.

22:49.140 --> 22:52.849
Ooh, I am
driving my life away,

22:52.860 --> 22:55.954
looking for a better way for me.

22:59.960 --> 23:00.710
-Where are you off to?

23:00.720 --> 23:02.927
-Nowhere.

23:02.930 --> 23:04.204
-Be home for dinner.

23:04.210 --> 23:04.995
-I will.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.398
-I saw Lucia.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.402
She's not too happy
about the change in plan.

23:13.410 --> 23:15.071
-Welcome to the club.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.729
-She wants Larrick dead.

23:16.730 --> 23:17.958
-Who doesn't?

23:17.960 --> 23:20.303
-She was going to do it as soon
as he got us into the camp.

23:20.310 --> 23:21.641
-That was never the plan.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.582
-That was her plan.

23:22.590 --> 23:24.740
-Well, that would've
gotten us killed.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.638
-She's young and impetuous.

23:26.650 --> 23:27.344
-She'll get over it.

23:27.350 --> 23:29.466
-I'm not so sure about that.

23:29.470 --> 23:31.119
-What do you mean?

23:31.120 --> 23:34.283
-She burns hot.

23:34.290 --> 23:35.621
-That sounds like
someone I know.

24:16.650 --> 24:17.719
-I wasn't sure you'd come.

24:17.730 --> 24:20.847
-As you see, I'm here.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.772
-You want something to drink?

24:22.780 --> 24:23.849
-I'd like to get this over with.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.561
I will ask you questions.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.221
You will answer yes or no.

24:50.230 --> 24:50.924
-I understand.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.810
-Is your name Nina
Sergeevna Krylova?

24:58.820 --> 24:59.514
-Yes.

25:02.540 --> 25:04.121
-Were you born in Vladivostok?

25:04.130 --> 25:04.824
-Yes.

25:07.980 --> 25:11.461
-Do you work at the Rezidentura?

25:11.470 --> 25:12.164
-Yes.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.121
-Are you a member of the KGB?

25:18.130 --> 25:18.824
-Yes.

25:23.380 --> 25:24.699
-Have you ever
betrayed your country?

25:27.620 --> 25:28.314
-Yes.

25:32.870 --> 25:35.247
-Does anyone from the
Rezidentura know you're here?

25:45.790 --> 25:46.484
-No.

25:49.930 --> 25:51.249
Did you smuggle

25:51.260 --> 25:53.319
electronic equipment out
of the United States?

25:56.020 --> 25:56.714
-Yes.

26:00.610 --> 26:03.693
-Does the Rezidentura
know about this?

26:03.700 --> 26:05.053
-No.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.061
Yes.

26:06.070 --> 26:06.911
Yes, no.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.273
I-- I don't know if
they know or not.

26:11.150 --> 26:12.117
-Let's continue.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.183
-May I have some water?

26:49.460 --> 26:51.371
-Did you betray your country?

26:51.380 --> 26:52.074
-Yes.

26:54.930 --> 26:56.659
Did you betray your country

26:56.660 --> 26:58.639
for ideological or
political reasons?

26:58.640 --> 27:00.619
-No.

27:00.630 --> 27:02.359
Were your reasons personal?

27:05.190 --> 27:07.420
-Yes.

27:07.430 --> 27:08.624
Do you know

27:08.630 --> 27:10.348
who murdered FBI
agent Chris Amador?

27:13.380 --> 27:14.074
-No.

27:17.110 --> 27:19.203
Do you
know who murdered Vlad Kosygin?

27:26.820 --> 27:27.514
-Yes.

27:31.530 --> 27:33.680
Do you know why?

27:33.690 --> 27:34.384
-Yes.

27:40.010 --> 27:41.784
-Have you deceived your
contact in the FBI?

27:46.360 --> 27:47.054
-No.

27:51.430 --> 27:54.183
-Are you pretending to be an FBI
informant when, in fact, you're

27:54.190 --> 27:57.819
spying for the Soviet Union?

27:57.820 --> 27:58.514
-No.

28:01.140 --> 28:02.391
Are you sure?

28:05.320 --> 28:07.584
-Yes.

28:07.590 --> 28:13.904
-Appears to be some ambiguity
in your answer to this question.

28:13.910 --> 28:15.502
Is there anything
that you can tell me

28:15.510 --> 28:18.297
that might clear
up any confusion?

28:18.300 --> 28:20.666
-No.

28:20.670 --> 28:21.932
Are you sure?

28:21.940 --> 28:22.634
-Yes.

28:30.260 --> 28:30.954
-We're done.

28:51.790 --> 28:52.745
-You passed.

28:56.230 --> 28:57.219
You passed.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.214
-OK.

29:05.220 --> 29:07.506
No problem.

29:07.510 --> 29:09.193
-Good evening, Raymond.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.508
Working the late shift, eh?

29:10.510 --> 29:11.534
-Ah, might as well be.

29:11.540 --> 29:12.234
New baby.

29:12.240 --> 29:12.934
Up all night.

29:12.940 --> 29:13.725
-First one?

29:13.730 --> 29:15.311
-First and last.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.242
My wife, she don't want
to go back to work.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.878
Likes staying home
with the noodle.

29:19.880 --> 29:23.099
-I left my reading glasses in
Professor Rosenbloom's office

29:23.110 --> 29:23.804
earlier today.

29:23.810 --> 29:25.402
I can't see a bloody
thing without them.

29:25.410 --> 29:26.832
Is it OK if I get them?

29:26.840 --> 29:27.693
-Your name?

29:27.700 --> 29:28.507
-Charles Duluth.

29:31.190 --> 29:32.259
With a Mr. Peter Emory?

29:32.260 --> 29:33.136
-That's right.

29:33.140 --> 29:34.402
-I'll need to see
some identification.

29:40.370 --> 29:41.064
All right.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.651
I'll hang onto this
til you return the key.

29:42.660 --> 29:43.354
-No problem.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.418
Thank you, Raymond.

29:44.420 --> 29:45.114
-You're welcome, Sir.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.771
-The lab's not empty.

31:12.780 --> 31:13.826
It's supposed to be empty.
-OK.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.524
Calm down.

31:14.530 --> 31:16.270
-What do we do?

31:16.280 --> 31:19.181
-Calm down.

31:19.190 --> 31:21.124
Stay here.

31:21.130 --> 31:22.097
Don't move.

31:29.870 --> 31:32.316
-I'm sorry.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.368
-I would've done the
same If I were you.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.064
-Would you?

31:38.490 --> 31:40.913
We need to find a
way to get you out.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.070
-And go where?

31:43.080 --> 31:43.978
I don't want to leave.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.118
I don't want to leave you.

31:53.550 --> 31:54.960
-What about Oleg?

31:54.970 --> 31:56.881
-I can handle Oleg.

31:56.890 --> 31:57.584
Oleg is a peanut.

31:57.590 --> 32:00.388
He only works for himself.

32:00.390 --> 32:02.676
He has a powerful
father in a high place,

32:02.680 --> 32:04.022
but Arkady has contempt for him.

32:04.030 --> 32:08.558
-He wants the surveillance
reports we have on him.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.074
-Can you do that?

32:11.080 --> 32:13.355
-To keep you safe?

32:13.360 --> 32:14.054
Yes.

32:18.430 --> 32:22.127
-I can get information to undo
the damage from the reports.

32:22.130 --> 32:23.518
Where he goes, how, when.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.215
-No,no.

32:25.220 --> 32:27.984
-I want to do what
I can-- for us.

32:31.850 --> 32:34.956
Arkady's in the process of
getting approval from Moscow

32:34.960 --> 32:38.771
for me to be read into
the Illegals program.

32:38.780 --> 32:40.259
IfI get in, I can get anything.

32:50.590 --> 32:53.047
I need to prepare.

32:53.050 --> 32:56.019
-OK.

32:56.030 --> 32:59.579
-We are together now.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.707
Forever, yes?

33:01.710 --> 33:02.404
-Yes.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.549
-What's the code?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.029
-Well, I just--

33:40.030 --> 33:41.019
-The numbers, Charles!

33:41.020 --> 33:42.999
-I wrote it down.

33:43.000 --> 33:43.819
The ink.

33:43.830 --> 33:45.923
I can't read it.

33:45.930 --> 33:46.624
-The numbers.

33:46.630 --> 33:47.927
What are the numbers?

33:47.930 --> 33:50.535
-S-- six, three,
two, four, six, one.

33:50.540 --> 33:52.974
Wa-- wait a minute!

33:52.980 --> 33:55.073
Six, two, three, four, six, one.

33:55.080 --> 33:55.774
-You sure?

33:55.780 --> 33:56.644
-I think so.

33:56.650 --> 33:57.924
-You think?

33:57.930 --> 33:59.409
-Six, two, three,
four, six, one!

33:59.420 --> 34:00.114
I'm sure!

34:00.120 --> 34:00.814
-Go.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.269
-Another setback.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.269
Of course.

35:49.880 --> 35:54.237
-Jefe, that was amazing.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.049
I haven't had an
adrenalin rush like that

35:56.050 --> 35:58.905
since I did the esteemed
Madam Senator from Missouri

35:58.910 --> 36:00.650
in the Capitol washroom
during conference.

36:03.860 --> 36:07.739
I see how you can develop a
jones for that sort of thing.

36:07.740 --> 36:08.434
It's addictive.

36:11.140 --> 36:14.906
I'm just saying, it
was exhilarating.

36:14.910 --> 36:16.889
-You didn't look exhilarated.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.811
-First time jitters.

36:18.820 --> 36:20.378
I'll be better the next time.

36:20.380 --> 36:22.598
-Glad you enjoyed yourself.

36:22.610 --> 36:23.770
-I'm just saying--

36:23.780 --> 36:25.224
-Yeah, I get it.

36:25.230 --> 36:27.460
Charles, I get it.

36:27.470 --> 36:31.884
-We did what we were
supposed to do, didn't we?

36:31.890 --> 36:33.369
-Yes we did.

36:33.380 --> 36:34.210
-Then what?

36:40.240 --> 36:43.209
-I, um, I killed someone.

36:43.220 --> 36:45.529
Someone who happened to
be in the wrong place

36:45.540 --> 36:46.234
at the wrong time.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.599
-You did what you had to do.

36:50.610 --> 36:52.475
-For what?

36:52.480 --> 36:54.983
I mean, what was the point?

36:54.990 --> 36:58.619
For some X's and O's
on a virtual highway?

36:58.630 --> 36:59.801
I don't even know
what that means.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.983
Do you know how many
people I've killed?

37:04.990 --> 37:06.969
I mean, looked into their eyes?

37:06.970 --> 37:08.323
Watched them die?

37:08.330 --> 37:09.809
-It's what you do.

37:14.790 --> 37:16.394
And you do it so very well.

37:18.990 --> 37:22.357
-You said you'd stopped.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.464
-This is cranberry
juice and soda water.

37:29.250 --> 37:32.117
Try it.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.371
No, really.

37:33.380 --> 37:34.074
Try it.

37:38.140 --> 37:40.631
You're wrong.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.609
-About what, exactly?

37:43.620 --> 37:45.599
-I'm not pathetic.

37:45.610 --> 37:48.261
I have value to
you, to the cause.

37:50.870 --> 37:51.564
Try it.

38:02.220 --> 38:05.451
I had a grand old time.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.257
Call me anytime.

38:12.450 --> 38:13.462
-Can I get you something?

38:13.470 --> 38:14.164
-Yeah.

38:14.170 --> 38:15.706
I'll have whatever he had.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.214
-Enjoy.

38:51.790 --> 38:53.644
-The bathroom
floor has a heater,

38:53.650 --> 38:55.197
and there's a jacuzzi
in the bathtub.

38:58.010 --> 38:59.568
You want to take_
a decadent jacu22I

38:59.580 --> 39:01.366
with me in our decadent bathtub?

39:04.110 --> 39:04.804
-I do.

40:38.670 --> 40:39.500
-Call and response?
