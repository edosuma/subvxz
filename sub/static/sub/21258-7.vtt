00:02.400 --> 00:04.664
convincing hardman that two
kickass junior partners

00:04.813 --> 00:07.468
are worth as much as one new
senior partner.

00:07.523 --> 00:09.673
You had the chance to triple
our business,

00:09.721 --> 00:11.470

take a knee.

Hardman told me he wasn't
gonna make you partner anyway.

00:16.526 --> 00:18.283

all I had to do was...

00:18.330 --> 00:19.352

those prisons.

41:31.805 --> 41:33.094
That crime wasn't a murder.

41:33.142 --> 41:35.008
Did you hear me, Donna?
They had him.

41:35.056 --> 41:36.683
I had a wife and daughter,
and they set me up.

41:36.730 --> 41:38.844
What was I supposed to do?

41:39.867 --> 41:42.008
Mike, I hate these people.

41:42.094 --> 41:44.078
They deserve to go away
for what they did,

41:44.149 --> 41:46.196
and every morning when I woke up
and every night

41:46.244 --> 41:48.555
when I went to sleep,
I wanted to make that happen,

41:48.703 --> 41:52.211
but I didn't, for one reason:

41:52.367 --> 41:54.515
I didn't want my daughter
to grow up without a father,

41:54.579 --> 41:55.696
and if you pursue this,

41:55.744 --> 41:57.524
there's no way I don't get
caught up in it.

41:57.572 --> 41:58.792
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

41:58.839 --> 42:00.508
When Bratton came after
our clients,

42:00.602 --> 42:03.720
Alex signed a declaration saying
he took full responsibility.

42:03.852 --> 42:05.945
Harvey, if you're asking Mike
to let this thing go...

42:06.015 --> 42:07.547
I don't know if I can do that.

42:07.642 --> 42:09.298
I'm not asking you
to let it go.

42:09.383 --> 42:11.727
I'm telling you what will happen
if you don't.
