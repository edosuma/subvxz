WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.500
PREVIOUSLY ON DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.500 --> 00:05.208
DO YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT THE PILL BOTTLE

00:05.208 --> 00:06.834
I SAW IN YOUR BATHROOM
YESTERDAY?

00:06.834 --> 00:08.583
I STARTED TAKING IT
AFTER TIM DIED.

00:08.583 --> 00:11.291
MY NEW DOCTOR'S
NOT GOING TO REFILL
MY PRESCRIPTION.

00:11.291 --> 00:13.667
SHE WANTS ME TO TRY
THERAPY INSTEAD.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.834
WELL, MAYBE THERAPY'S
NOT SUCH A BAD IDEA.

00:15.834 --> 00:18.750
ALL I'M SAYING IS
IS THAT I'M OPEN-MINDED.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.166
MY NARROW-MINDED WAYS
ARE OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.

00:21.166 --> 00:23.667
THIS MORNING I TOLD MY FATHER
THAT I WAS GAY.

00:23.667 --> 00:26.208
SO YOU ARE.

00:26.208 --> 00:27.125
DAWSON...

00:32.417 --> 00:34.000
[KNOCK KNOCK]

00:34.000 --> 00:36.125
WHAT'S UP?
I CAME OVER AS SOON
AS I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

00:36.125 --> 00:37.125
I'M FREAKING OUT.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.166
WHY? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

00:39.166 --> 00:40.917
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.208
YEAH,
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.208
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES,
YOU'RE GONNA BE 16.

00:46.208 --> 00:48.458
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
THIS IS A MAJOR
TURNING POINT.

00:48.458 --> 00:51.750
YEAH. AND I'M ETERNALLY LOST
AS A SPECIES ON THIS PLANET.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.208
OH, THIS IS
GONNA BE BAD.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.375
I'M ABOUT TO BE 16 YEARS OLD
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,

00:55.375 --> 00:56.208
AND I'M STILL...ME!

00:56.208 --> 00:58.959
THE SAME WHINY,
ADOLESCENT,

00:58.959 --> 01:01.375
BIG-TALKING,
LITTLE-DOING LOSER
THAT I WAS A YEAR AGO.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.750
COME ON, DAWSON,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.375
IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
THINK ABOUT IT:

01:05.375 --> 01:06.875
EVERY SINGLE PERSON
THAT I KNOW

01:06.875 --> 01:09.125
IS GROWING UP AND
MOVING FORWARD IN SOME WAY.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.250
ALL RIGHT? JOEY IS BUSY
FINDING HERSELF.

01:11.250 --> 01:14.208
YOU'VE GOT THIS
WHOLE STABLE, DO-GOODER
BOYFRIEND THING HAPPENING.

01:14.208 --> 01:17.125
JEN IS...
NOT NECESSARILY
MOVING FORWARD,

01:17.125 --> 01:18.542
BUT AT LEAST
SHE'S MOVING.

01:18.542 --> 01:20.542
EVEN MY PARENTS ARE
STARTING NEW LIVES.

01:20.542 --> 01:24.333
ME? I'M IN THE EXACT SAME
PLACE I WAS LAST YEAR
AT THIS TIME.

01:24.333 --> 01:27.750
UH...UH...
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
TURNING 16, DAWSON.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.583
REJOICE, THIS IS A GOOD THING.
YOU'RE GETTING OLDER.

01:29.583 --> 01:33.041
BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE ANYTHING AHEAD OF ME
BUT MORE OF THE SAME.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.792
I'M STAGNANT.
NO WONDER JOEY DUMPED ME.

01:34.792 --> 01:37.458
I MEAN, THE ONLY THING
I ACCOMPLISHED LAST YEAR

01:37.458 --> 01:39.083
WAS REALIZING
MY FEELINGS FOR HER,

01:39.083 --> 01:40.875
AND I COULDN'T
EVEN HOLD ONTO HER.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.750
AND SHE DUMPED ME...
FOR A GAY GUY.

01:42.750 --> 01:46.750
COULD WE PLEASE TALK
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
GAY MAN-STRAIGHT WOMAN THING?

01:46.750 --> 01:50.667
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING GOING ON THERE
THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.208
YOU'RE RIGHT, DAWSON.

01:52.208 --> 01:54.208
IT'S ALL PART
OF THE EVIL GAY PLAN

01:54.208 --> 01:55.875
TO KEEP THE SPECIES
FROM REPOPULATING.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.750
I WOULD KEEP A CLOSE EYE
ON ANDIE IF I WERE YOU.

01:57.750 --> 02:01.333
COME ON, DAWSON.
YOU NEED TO STOP
LOOKING TO THE MOVIES

02:01.333 --> 02:03.125
FOR ANSWERS TO ALL
OF LIFE'S QUESTIONS, OK?

02:03.125 --> 02:05.333
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO...
[SIGHS]

02:05.333 --> 02:07.041
IS FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU WANT

02:07.041 --> 02:07.750
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN. OK?

02:07.750 --> 02:08.875
BE DEFINITIVE.

02:08.875 --> 02:10.792
YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:10.792 --> 02:14.458
I NEED--I NEED ANS--
DEFINITIVE ANSWERS.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.000
JOEY IS THE ANSWER.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I HAD HER, I LOST HER,
AND NOW I'M GONNA GET HER BACK.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.417
HOW'S THAT FOR DEFINITIVE?

03:23.583 --> 03:25.000
MITCH?

03:26.500 --> 03:28.417
HEY. YOU REMEMBER
MY TRADITION

03:28.417 --> 03:31.000
OF COOKING DAWSON BREAKFAST
ON HIS BIRTHDAY, RIGHT?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.542
WELL, OF COURSE.

03:32.542 --> 03:33.875
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT--

03:33.875 --> 03:34.959
DAD.

03:34.959 --> 03:37.792
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT ME
TO FORGET, DID YOU?

03:37.792 --> 03:39.375
THE USUAL,

03:39.375 --> 03:41.417
FOR OUR REGULAR CUSTOMER.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.125
THANK YOU.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.125
I MUST SAY,
IT'S NICE TO HAVE

03:46.125 --> 03:46.959
A BIT OF TRADITION
THIS MORNING.

03:46.959 --> 03:49.208
UH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,

03:49.208 --> 03:51.625
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR MOM
IN PRIVATE FOR A SECOND.

03:51.625 --> 03:53.834
IT'S, UH,
BIRTHDAY PRESENT STUFF.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.458
HIGHLY CLASSIFIED.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.542
LOOK, I KNOW WE HAVEN'T
DISCUSSED IT

04:01.542 --> 04:05.542
IN LIGHT OF THE EVENTS
OF THE PAST YEAR,

04:05.542 --> 04:08.708
BUT WE USUALLY DO GIVE
JOINT BIRTHDAY PRESENTS,

04:08.708 --> 04:09.875
OHH!
AND I HAD AN IDEA.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.917
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE
FOR THIS, MITCH.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.667
I'VE ALREADY BOUGHT
HIS PRESENT.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.792
I'M GIVING DAWSON
HIS FIRST CAR TONIGHT.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.291
AN EXPLORER.

04:19.583 --> 04:22.458
WELL, THAT'S
A BIG DECISION, GALE.

04:22.458 --> 04:23.458
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S ONE

04:23.458 --> 04:25.583
WE COULD'VE MADE
TOGETHER?

04:29.708 --> 04:32.041
...FOR INSTANCE, UM,
THE BILLS, WHICH, BELIEVE IT OR
NOT,

04:32.041 --> 04:33.792
DESPITE THE FACT YOU
DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE,
KEEP COMING.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.417
I KNOW...

04:36.417 --> 04:38.583
THAT I SHOULD
CONTRIBUTE MORE
FINANCIALLY,

04:38.583 --> 04:41.125
AND I'VE PUT
THE RESTAURANT PLANS
ON THE BACK BURNER,

04:41.125 --> 04:43.500
AND I'VE LOOKED
INTO SUBSTITUTING
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.375
I WILL HELP OUT MORE
AS SOON AS I CAN.

04:45.375 --> 04:49.583
BUT STILL,
A NEW CAR?

04:49.583 --> 04:51.625
THAT'S A PRETTY
EXTRAVAGANT GIFT
FOR A 16 YEAR OLD.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.667
Joey: LET'S GO OVER THIS
ONE MORE TIME.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.250
Pacey: OK. I INVITE
DAWSON OUT TO DINNER

04:54.250 --> 04:56.708
WITH ANDIE AND ME
TONIGHT,

04:56.708 --> 04:58.417
WE KEEP HIM OCCUPIED
TILL ABOUT 9:00,

04:58.417 --> 05:00.375
AT WHICH POINT WE MAKE UP
SOME LAME-ASS EXCUSE

05:00.375 --> 05:01.458
AS TO WHY WE HAVE TO
CALL IT AN EARLY NIGHT.

05:01.458 --> 05:04.792
THEN WE DRIVE HIM BACK
TO HIS PLACE, WHERE...

05:04.792 --> 05:07.792
I'LL HAVE SET UP
THE MOST FABULOUS
SURPRISE PARTY EVER.

05:07.792 --> 05:09.250
I HOPE.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.667
I'M SURE IT'LL BE FANTASTIC--

05:11.667 --> 05:13.208
A TESTIMONIAL
TO TRUE FRIENDSHIP,

05:13.208 --> 05:15.333
THE PARTY TO END ALL PARTIES.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.667
FROM HERE ON OUT,
THE LEERY HOUSEHOLD'S
GONNA BE KNOWN

05:17.667 --> 05:18.792
AS THE DELTA HOUSE
OF CAPESIDE.

05:18.792 --> 05:20.625
THANKS.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.250
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M SO NERVOUS.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.500
I'VE NEVER ORGANIZED
A PARTY BEFORE.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.333
LISTEN, JOEY,

05:36.333 --> 05:40.750
NOT TO PRY OR ANYTHING,
BUT...

05:40.750 --> 05:43.125
HOW ARE YOU DOIN'...

05:43.125 --> 05:44.625
WITH THE WHOLE JACK THING?

05:44.625 --> 05:46.834
I MEAN, NOW THAT YOU'VE
HAD SOME TIME TO PROCESS.

05:46.834 --> 05:50.208
GOD.

05:50.208 --> 05:53.166
EVERYONE KEEPS ASKING ME THAT
IN THESE SOLEMN TONES,

05:53.166 --> 05:55.041
LIKE I'VE JUST COME DOWN
WITH A TERMINAL DISEASE
OR SOMETHING.

05:55.041 --> 05:57.875
PACEY, THE FACT IS

05:57.875 --> 05:59.208
JACK IS THE ONE WHO'S
GOING THROUGH SOMETHING.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.708
AND, YEAH, I ADMIT,

06:01.708 --> 06:04.000
AT FIRST IT WAS
OBVIOUSLY A SHOCK,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
BUT, LOOK, I'M FINE.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.708
REALLY, IT'S...

06:14.208 --> 06:16.917
Abby:
HEY, JACK!

06:16.917 --> 06:19.208
YOU GUYS SERVING
LUNCH YET?

06:19.208 --> 06:20.625
YEAH. IN ABOUT,
UH, 10 MINUTES.

06:20.625 --> 06:21.917
HEY, HERE'S SOME, UH,

06:21.917 --> 06:24.500
SOME MENUS YOU GUYS
CAN LOOK OVER IN THE MEANTIME.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.583
GREAT.

06:25.583 --> 06:27.208
WE'RE COMPLETELY
STARVING.

06:27.208 --> 06:29.500
ARE--ARE YOU
THAT GUY?

06:29.500 --> 06:30.875
WHAT?

06:30.875 --> 06:33.375
YEAH, THE FIRST GUY
TO EVER COME OUT
AT CAPESIDE.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.250
HE--HE WAS THE ONE
THAT WROTE THE POEM.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.041
IN THE FLESH.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.792
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE THE GAY GUY.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.750
TRACY, KELLY,
THIS IS JACK McPHEE.

06:40.750 --> 06:44.041
CAPESIDE'S NO LONGER
AMBIGUOUS RESIDENT.

06:44.041 --> 06:45.375
Tracy: OH.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.625
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S SO GREAT

06:47.625 --> 06:49.542
THAT YOU CAME OUT
AND YOU'RE ONLY 16.

06:49.542 --> 06:50.583
YOU KNOW, I TOTALLY
WATCHED ELLEN

06:50.583 --> 06:53.667
THROUGH THAT WHOLE
TUMULTUOUS YEAR,

06:53.667 --> 06:55.708
AND, WELL, SHE DIDN'T
EVEN COME OUT TILL
SHE WAS, LIKE, 40.

06:55.708 --> 06:58.458
UH, C-CAN I GET YOU GUYS
SOMETHING TO DRINK

06:58.458 --> 07:00.417
WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING
OVER THESE MENUS?

07:00.417 --> 07:02.417
YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED
YOU'RE THE FIRST
GAY PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

07:02.417 --> 07:05.083
IT IS SUCH A WASTE,
ACTUALLY,

07:05.083 --> 07:06.708
BECAUSE YOU ARE
A TOTAL BABE.

07:06.708 --> 07:08.250
UH, YEAH,
WELL, YOU KNOW,

07:08.250 --> 07:09.291
I'D TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT

07:09.291 --> 07:11.000
IF IT WASN'T
COMING FROM SATAN.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.041
JACK! YOU HAVE
GOT ME ALL WRONG.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.750
I'M NOT EVEN
ONE OF HIS HELPERS.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.250
THEN I SHOULD COMPLIMENT YOU
ON THAT CLEVER DISGUISE

07:18.250 --> 07:19.291
YOU'VE BEEN WEARING
FOR MONTHS.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.750
WE GOT STARTED OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.750
TRUE, I MAY HAVE BEEN
FLAWED IN THE PAST,

07:23.750 --> 07:27.625
BUT...SOMETIMES PEOPLE
CAN SURPRISE YOU.

07:27.625 --> 07:30.625
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD
KNOW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THAT YOURSELF.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.583
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE HAD
A LOT ON YOUR SHOULDERS

07:38.583 --> 07:40.750
FOR A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

07:42.291 --> 07:43.542
YEAH.

07:43.542 --> 07:45.417
WELL, UM,
AFTER TIM DIED

07:45.417 --> 07:48.125
AND MY MOTHER,
YOU KNOW...

07:48.125 --> 07:51.375
UM...IT FELT LIKE THERE
NEEDED TO BE SOMEONE

07:51.375 --> 07:54.333
TO BE THE GLUE HOLDING
THE FAMILY TOGETHER.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.125
AND I GUESS I WAS
THE LIKELY CANDIDATE.

07:56.125 --> 08:00.041
IT'S NOT A BIG SURPRISE
THAT YOU STARTED
TO FEEL OVERWHELMED.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.166
YEAH, UM...

08:01.166 --> 08:04.083
I FELT LIKE I WAS

08:04.083 --> 08:06.834
JUGGLING ALL THESE
BALLS IN THE AIR
AT ONCE, YOU KNOW,

08:06.834 --> 08:10.250
AND IF I DROPPED ONE,
THEN THEY'D ALL COME
CRASHING DOWN,

08:10.250 --> 08:12.792
AND, UM, THEN I'D JUST
START THINKING ABOUT
EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE,

08:12.792 --> 08:15.458
AND--AND I'D GET
THESE PANIC ATTACKS

08:15.458 --> 08:18.041
WHERE I'D START FEELING
LIKE MY HEART WAS RACING

08:18.041 --> 08:18.917
AND I COULDN'T BREATHE,
AND--

08:18.917 --> 08:20.792
ANDIE, ANDIE,
TELL ME SOMETHING.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.000
FORGET ABOUT SAVING
EVERYBODY ELSE

08:23.000 --> 08:25.166
AND EVEN FORGET ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY FOR A MINUTE.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.333
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU WANT?

08:27.333 --> 08:29.083
WHAT DO YOU WISH FOR?

08:29.083 --> 08:30.625
FOR YOURSELF?

08:32.082 --> 08:35.457
I WISH I COULD GET RID
OF ALL MY WORRIES,

08:35.457 --> 08:37.500
YOU KNOW, AND--AND
BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

08:37.500 --> 08:40.166
WHO JUST SAILS
RIGHT THROUGH LIFE.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.375
YOU KNOW, AND THEY DO
WHAT THEY WANNA DO,

08:41.375 --> 08:43.833
WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY,

08:43.833 --> 08:46.000
AND DON'T CARE
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
THINK ABOUT THEM.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.333
WHY COULDN'T YOU?

08:47.333 --> 08:50.166
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A PRESCRIPTION, ANDIE.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.000
BUT NOT FOR A DRUG.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.458
I PRESCRIBE FOR YOU

08:54.458 --> 08:58.583
ONE NIGHT OF IMPERFECTION.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.834
HERE. YOU CAN GET
OUT OF HERE EARLY.

09:06.834 --> 09:08.250
I'M SURE YOU WANNA
GET CHANGED

09:08.250 --> 09:09.875
BEFORE GOING TO DAWSON'S.

09:09.875 --> 09:13.208
BELIEVE ME, IT'S NOT
GONNA TAKE ME LONG
TO GET DRESSED.

09:13.208 --> 09:16.458
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE
TO GET ALL GUSSIED UP
FOR ANYBODY,

09:16.458 --> 09:19.542
SEEING AS THOUGH
I'VE TURNED JACK OFF
TO WOMEN COMPLETELY.

09:19.542 --> 09:21.083
JOEY, YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.291
YEAH, I KNOW.

09:23.291 --> 09:25.959
IT'S NOT TRUE.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.375
I MEAN, INTELLECTUALLY,

09:29.375 --> 09:31.959
I KNOW THAT IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

09:31.959 --> 09:32.959
IT'S...

09:34.875 --> 09:36.375
BESSIE...

09:39.208 --> 09:41.083
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW?

09:41.083 --> 09:43.375
YOU PAINT.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.083
YOU CONCENTRATE ON
YOUR ART AND YOURSELF.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.917
YOU BROKE UP WITH DAWSON
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO
FIND YOURSELF,

09:48.917 --> 09:51.333
THEN YOU WENT STRAIGHT
INTO A RELATIONSHIP
WITH JACK.

09:51.333 --> 09:55.083
MAYBE THIS IS A CHANCE
FOR YOU TO DO WHAT
YOU SET OUT TO DO.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.542
I MEAN, LOOK, ANY WOMAN
WOULD BE FEELING
THE WAY YOU DO RIGHT NOW

I'VE--I'VE EVER BEEN
TAUGHT TO BELIEVE.

TONIGHT,

39:46.500 --> 39:47.458

39:55.250 --> 39:57.375
MAYBE--MAYBE SOME DAY,
WHEN I DEAL WITH MY BAGGAGE,

39:57.375 --> 39:59.959
THEN MAYBE
THIS CAN WORK OUT.

39:59.959 --> 40:01.542

MAKE ME FEEL LIKE THIS

I'M SO HOPELESSLY LONELY.

41:14.875 --> 41:16.625

YOU GOT DRUNK?

41:18.041 --> 41:19.583

41:24.041 --> 41:26.000

BREAK UP WITH ME

41:26.000 --> 41:26.708

41:36.792 --> 41:40.750
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
BETTER, DAWSON.

41:40.750 --> 41:44.917
IT WAS ABOUT LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE WHO...

41:44.917 --> 41:47.417
WASN'T SO CLOSE TO ME.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.000
SO I COULD TELL WHERE
I ENDED AND HE BEGAN.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.208
I MEAN, OUR LIVES
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
SO INTERTWINED

41:52.208 --> 41:54.667
THAT, IN MANY WAYS,

41:54.667 --> 41:57.792

LIKE YOU PARTIALLY
INVENTED ME, DAWSON.

SO MUCH.

CAN BE A WHOLE PERSON...
