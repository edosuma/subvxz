00:16.180 --> 00:16.960
It was a mistake.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.570
It was supposed to be you.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.120
You should design the wardrobe for the moviE.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.570
I'm not a costume designer.

00:24.770 --> 00:27.920
You were there,it's authentic,
and I would be lucky to have you.

01:46.120 --> 01:49.800
Well,his brother's a murderer,so probably like crap.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.610
I haven't talked to him much lately.

01:52.990 --> 01:55.080
Well,he probably really needs you right now.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.000
You can make a big difference for him.

01:58.340 --> 02:02.290
Hi.I'm sorrY.I know that we were supposed to look at costumes today.

02:02.410 --> 02:04.960
I've just been totally turned around dealing with...

02:05.610 --> 02:06.360
fashion femme fatale thwarts killer!

02:07.500 --> 02:09.060
the press.

02:11.170 --> 02:13.710
Can't they just go back to stalking britney or something?

02:13.820 --> 02:14.570
Oh,come on.

02:14.690 --> 02:17.770
"Hot clothing designer tracks down attacker and exacts revenge.

02:17.850 --> 02:20.640
" If you're not gonna sell me the movie rights,
you should at least ame the tabloid.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.020
So that every time I look at it,
I can be reminded of the fact

02:23.100 --> 02:27.640
that my attacker was also quentin's killer
and that maybe if i had reported it.

02:28.070 --> 02:30.690
brooke,you were attacked by a guy in a mask.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.620
Even if you had reported it,the chances of the police
finding him were slim to none.

02:35.050 --> 02:36.610
It's not your fault.

02:36.730 --> 02:37.910
I know.

02:38.570 --> 02:40.100
It's just sad.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.090
Yeah.

02:43.450 --> 02:45.960
Listen,take the day,focus on your work.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.920
I'll come back tonight and see where you're at,okay?

02:48.200 --> 02:50.880
I got you a latte,extra foam.

02:51.390 --> 02:52.400
See you.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.060
- Bye,samson.
- Bye,julian.

02:59.110 --> 03:01.070
You've got a date.

03:01.230 --> 03:02.750
I have a business meetinG.

03:02.830 --> 03:05.690
Yeah,like his junk's got a meeting with your lady business.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.170
Samantha!

03:07.790 --> 03:09.040
What?

03:26.500 --> 03:27.850
wow,that was fast.

03:32.170 --> 03:36.510
I just realized I'm gonna be pregnant on our wedding day,
and that is so redneck.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.090
Well,I think you're gonna look beautiful.

03:40.910 --> 03:43.260
Now,what's really bothering you,huh?

03:44.590 --> 03:46.430
How am I gonna tell brooke?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.070
So,how are you gonna tell peyton?

03:48.150 --> 03:49.130
What?

03:49.560 --> 03:51.260
That you're going out with julian.

03:51.380 --> 03:53.260
Aren't they,like,practically married or something?

03:53.380 --> 03:55.580
I told you,it's not a date.It's business.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.490
He said you were hot.

03:57.610 --> 04:00.580
He said "hot clothing designer tracks down attacker.

04:00.660 --> 04:02.530
" He meant successful.

04:02.920 --> 04:03.470
Yeah.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.880
'Cause thaempty store is just kicking so much fashion asS.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.730
Okay.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.200
He meant hot as in hot.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.960
So do yourself a favor.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.800
Dress a little sexy tonight.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.800
It's definitely a date.

04:31.510 --> 04:32.510
Hi,baby.

04:32.830 --> 04:35.900
You scared me,you wonderful man!

04:35.980 --> 04:37.980
Oh,I missed you.

04:38.050 --> 04:39.980
Good.Shut up and kiss me.

04:41.910 --> 04:43.360
Daddy's home!Daddy's home!

04:43.480 --> 04:44.930
Oh,there he is.

04:45.130 --> 04:47.050
Come here,buddy.I missed you.

04:47.130 --> 04:47.850
I missed you,too.

04:47.930 --> 04:49.930
- How long are you home?
- The whole weekend.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.100
Sweet.

04:51.220 --> 04:54.550
You have to come upstairs and see the new jersey mama bought me.

04:55.490 --> 04:57.150
All right.I'll be right up.

04:59.420 --> 05:02.750
So,how does it feel to be a pro basketball player?

05:03.260 --> 05:05.720
Mostly tired and sorE.

05:06.310 --> 05:07.700
It's good to be home,though.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.540
Just take a break from it all.

05:10.320 --> 05:14.350
'Cause you're not gonna be sore and tired after this weekend.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.400
Come on,dad!

05:17.610 --> 05:20.890
- Like I said,it's good to be home.
- Yeah.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.240
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.890
Brooke,peyton's here.You can tell her your big news.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.080
What's the news?

05:31.240 --> 05:33.100
There is no big news.

05:33.220 --> 05:34.470
Julian's hot for brookE.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.250
Don't listen to her.

05:36.490 --> 05:38.070
Brooke's totally hot for him,too.

05:38.970 --> 05:40.920
Do you want to go back to living in a car?

05:43.380 --> 05:45.220
Got anything for an awkward silence?

05:46.460 --> 05:47.810
I'm pregnant?

05:48.060 --> 05:52.600
No.No,no,no,brooke,don't cry,honey,okay?

05:52.680 --> 05:55.500
I-I know that you wanted to have a baby,
and I n't want to be insensitive to that.

05:55.580 --> 05:58.820
I just want you to know you are gonna
have a huge role in this baby's life.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.390
Thank you.

06:00.510 --> 06:03.010
That is not why I want to cry right now...I...

06:05.160 --> 06:08.650
I just finished your second wedding dress,and it has a corset,

06:09.040 --> 06:14.240
a painfully hand-stitched,skinny-girl corset.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.020
Maybe we can just cut a hole for my stomach?

06:20.240 --> 06:21.840
You're really pregnant?

06:21.960 --> 06:23.040
Yeah.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.040
Is it lucas'?

06:25.660 --> 06:27.150
You're pregnant!

06:29.110 --> 06:30.360
Oh,my god!

06:30.480 --> 06:35.370
Okay,I am going to excuse myself from
this whole brooke/peyton lesbian-love-hug thing.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.870
Don't forget about juliaN.

06:39.460 --> 06:40.790
Hot for brooke.

06:41.650 --> 06:42.410
No.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.210
Totally.

06:49.140 --> 06:50.050
Hi.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.550
I've been sitting here all week after work,just.

06:58.240 --> 07:05.290
I'm mad at myself for driving you away,
and I'm mad at you for what you did after thaT.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.770
I packed your stuff.

07:10.010 --> 07:13.800
I was thinking about just giving it away to a complete stranger --

07:14.290 --> 07:16.570
you know,like you did with your virginity?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.790
My virginity was mine,marvin.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.460
It was never yours.

07:23.470 --> 07:25.390
No,but you were.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.490
Have fun telling brooke you slept with owen.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.010
it's a good start,mia.It is.

07:51.510 --> 07:54.680
I know,but I owe peyton a song,not a good start.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.380
can I help you?

07:57.050 --> 08:01.230
I just wanted to talk to mia,
but I don't want to interrupt,so.

08:05.720 --> 08:06.930
Chase.

08:07.450 --> 08:08.820
Hi.

08:10.270 --> 08:12.100
You have to push the talk bacK.

08:14.160 --> 08:14.940
Hi.

08:15.530 --> 08:16.410
Hi,haley.

08:16.490 --> 08:17.500
Hey,man.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.070
Did you need something?

08:20.360 --> 08:24.070
Well,um.I was wondering if you wanted to hang out sometime.

08:24.310 --> 08:26.690
Like,go out,maybE.

08:26.890 --> 08:27.710
With me.

08:28.070 --> 08:29.160
Smooth.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.660
Sure,I'd love to.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.120
Take that,my friend.

08:34.240 --> 08:34.900
She's totally into me.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.360
Yeah?She also totally just heard everything you saiD.

08:42.419 --> 08:49.260
Uh.okay.Just want to come by to tric,like,8:00?

08:49.380 --> 08:51.290
Okay.Cool.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.070
- Cool.
- Cool.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.810
- Bye.
- Bye,dude.

09:03.270 --> 09:04.400
Oh,hey,honey,do you need help?

09:04.480 --> 09:06.530
- No,I -- aah!
- Geez!

09:08.780 --> 09:10.330
I'm so sorry!I had it!

09:10.460 --> 09:11.980
It's baby brooke!

09:12.090 --> 09:13.610
Oh,but I thought this was all --

09:13.730 --> 09:16.630
tied up in litigation with my evil bitch mom.

09:16.830 --> 09:19.170
It is,but these are the samples.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.150
Brooke,these are really,really good.

09:22.310 --> 09:25.840
God,why is victoria so petty that
she won't let you have just this one little part of the company?

09:25.920 --> 09:32.530
I think the better question is why anybody bothers having children
when they're just gonna refer to you as "evil bitch mom" someday.

09:34.790 --> 09:37.800
Yours is not going to do that.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.160
Okay.

09:39.360 --> 09:44.680
Speaking of kids,sam seems to think you and julian are meant for each otheR.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.550
She heard him asking me to work tonight,and she is having a field day with it.

09:48.590 --> 09:51.760
Hey,if you like him,don't bench yourself on my account.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.630
No.It's nothing.

09:53.670 --> 09:54.920
Not gonna happen.

09:58.670 --> 10:01.420
So,when's this thing with you and brooke gonna happen?

10:01.890 --> 10:03.920
Brooke and i are working together.

10:04.090 --> 10:05.880
Mm.I think you like her.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.410
- Do not.
- Do too.

10:07.530 --> 10:08.900
- Do not.
- Do too.

10:09.220 --> 10:09.480
No.

10:09.590 --> 10:11.590
So,I hear you like brookE.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.670
We are working togetheR.

10:14.790 --> 10:16.030
I have to get an office.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.250
He so likes her.

10:17.680 --> 10:18.700
That's what I said.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.410
I think you're jealous.

10:21.540 --> 10:24.360
Dude,get over yourself.She's pregnant.

10:28.310 --> 10:29.530
My bad.

10:30.550 --> 10:33.560
Um.see ya.

10:35.480 --> 10:41.500
Wow.That's,uh,really hard to hear for historical reasons.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.570
but great news for you and luke.

10:45.690 --> 10:46.820
I mean that.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.790
Thank you.We're excited about it.

10:48.910 --> 10:50.240
You should be.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.520
And I'm happy for yoU.

10:53.390 --> 10:55.340
That kid just won the lottery.

11:01.390 --> 11:02.470
Oh,I'm sorrY.I have to take thiS.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.090
Yeah,sure,no,I'll give you your space.

11:05.110 --> 11:06.950
You break her heart,I break your facE.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.540
Come in!

11:20.690 --> 11:22.390
Oh,millie,thank goodness you're here.

11:22.470 --> 11:27.790
Do the wor "I'll come back tonight and see
where you're at" sound even vaguely date-like to you?

11:28.290 --> 11:29.390
- I don'T.
- exactly.

11:29.430 --> 11:30.320
I agree.

11:30.400 --> 11:35.240
Especially since it came hot off the heels of me saying
I hadn't finished my costume stuff yet.Right?He has to mean businesS.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.650
Who?

11:36.810 --> 11:37.930
Julian.

11:38.060 --> 11:40.220
I don't know why I'm even in such a stew about thiS.

11:40.290 --> 11:44.430
I mean,he is so not into me,and even if he were,which he is not,

11:44.510 --> 11:47.870
it would so not be okay for me to be attracted to him.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.130
- are you?
- No.Yes.Maybe.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.360
I don't know.

11:52.840 --> 11:53.750
I don't know.

11:53.820 --> 11:57.980
But it doesn't matter because no matter what,
you cannot do something with your friend's ex,right?

11:58.060 --> 12:00.650
I mean,even if she says she's okay with it,that is a lie on some level,

12:00.750 --> 12:02.550
because we are never actually okay with it.

12:02.630 --> 12:06.510
And.it just isn't done.Right?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.480
Oh,are you crying?

12:15.250 --> 12:16.890
Millie,what's wrong?

12:18.850 --> 12:21.000
I slept with owen.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.520
Get ouT.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.520
Millie.wait.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.250
I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.

12:45.410 --> 12:46.460
I ruined everythinG.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.460
It's okaY.

12:50.670 --> 12:51.770
It's okaY.

12:52.630 --> 12:54.070
Everything's okay.

13:02.900 --> 13:03.920
I need your help.

13:04.030 --> 13:05.210
Packing?

13:07.160 --> 13:08.140
No.

13:08.860 --> 13:10.840
I need help picking out clothes for a date.

13:10.960 --> 13:14.800
Are you telling me you've been crisscrossing the country,
singing sad songs to broken-hearted boys,

13:14.880 --> 13:16.590
and yoand you haven't had a date lately?

13:16.710 --> 13:18.780
No,haley,you don't date on the road.

13:18.920 --> 13:25.560
You hang out on a stinky tour bus
and you kiss random boys sometimes,but I don't have date clothes.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.210
This is a disaster.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.410
I'm a musician.I don't have an iron.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.500
And I don't know how to iron even if I did.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.130
And what if it's weird?

13:33.230 --> 13:34.880
What are we gonna talk about?

13:35.030 --> 13:36.640
You know,do I offer to pay for stuff?

13:36.800 --> 13:38.710
Okay,will you hold off on the meltdown?

13:38.850 --> 13:40.170
This is just a datE.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.730
I think I should canceL.

13:41.810 --> 13:44.840
Okay,I have an idea.Look,nathan's back in town for the night.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.140
Why don't we all go out?

13:46.760 --> 13:47.520
Really?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.090
Yeah,it'll be fun.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.490
- You would do that for me?
- Come on,we could use a night out.

13:52.910 --> 13:54.280
That's awesome.

13:54.530 --> 13:55.290
- Thank you!
- Oh,you're welcome.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.220
Maybe -- do you think you could help with the iron?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.780
Oh,don't push your luck,girlie.I'll see you at 8:00.

14:08.450 --> 14:09.470
Hey,luke.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.660
Hey,hales.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.850
Okay,listen.I know peyton wasn't supposed to say anything,
but she told me you guys are pregnant,

14:20.930 --> 14:22.500
and I'm so happy for you!

14:23.320 --> 14:24.920
She wasn't supposed to say anything yet!

14:25.000 --> 14:27.830
She didn't!Ha!I knew it!Congratulations!

14:28.380 --> 14:29.690
Oh,you suck!

14:29.770 --> 14:30.060
Get over it.

14:30.180 --> 14:32.450
My best friend's gonna be a daD.Oh,I'm gonna be an aunt!

14:32.530 --> 14:35.010
Listen,whatever you need,I am here for you,okay?

14:35.400 --> 14:38.980
The same goes for you now that nathan's out on the road.
We're always here for yoU.

14:39.140 --> 14:40.360
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.150
Good,'cause I need somebody to watch jamie.And andrE.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.480
This was a set-up,wasn't it?

14:45.560 --> 14:49.440
Well,the squealing and hugging was really genuine,
but the rest of it was kind of a set-up.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.260
That's okay.We'd be happy to watch the kids.

14:52.550 --> 14:53.850
It'll be good practice.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.560
Cool.Thanks.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.050
Okay,boys,come on in.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.790
Oh.You meant now.

15:06.860 --> 15:12.110
Yeah,um,nathan fed them some cake,so they might be a little.

15:12.420 --> 15:16.840
Well,anyway,good luck,and congratulations again.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.370
I'm so happy for you.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.160
You're gonna be a great dad,luke.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.700
And I promise I'll act all surprised when peyton tells me.

15:23.170 --> 15:24.270
Thank you.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.380
Seriously,good luck.

15:46.150 --> 15:47.440
Hi,old friend.

15:56.240 --> 16:01.990
Before I say the next thing I'm gonna say,
I want to remind you that I love you.

16:04.260 --> 16:11.230
But having said that,you are a complete ass
for even thinking about messing around with gigi.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.420
As opposed to sleeping with owen.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.140
Okay.

16:18.470 --> 16:21.800
you have a right to be upset,and you have a right to be hurt.

16:22.190 --> 16:27.040
But I can guarantee you that as hurt or upset as you are,
millicent feels worse.

16:28.640 --> 16:34.240
Mouth,she lost the two things that matter the most to her,
and she can only get one of them back.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.410
It's stuck in my head,brooke.

16:37.540 --> 16:39.840
All I can see is the two of them.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.710
It's not like I can just decide everything's the samE.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.880
I think you're wrong.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.690
You can decide that everything is the same.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.050
If you can't,then you have to decide if you really love heR.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.410
Come on.

17:07.589 --> 17:09.079
Give me a dart.

17:12.220 --> 17:13.869
Feels good,doesn't it?

17:15.119 --> 17:16.569
It's gonna be okay.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.569
******

17:23.670 --> 17:25.520
******

17:26.190 --> 17:28.490
You guys break that box spring,you're sleeping on the floor.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.750
Follow me,guyS.

17:37.770 --> 17:40.000
Oh,you boys are in luck tonight!

17:40.080 --> 17:43.080
We have all kinds of crazy fun planned!

17:43.240 --> 17:44.880
Why are you talking funny?

17:46.050 --> 17:48.050
Uh,that's right.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.540
We've got.

17:49.620 --> 17:50.750
Drumroll,please.

17:52.860 --> 17:54.320
Movies!

17:56.230 --> 17:58.360
These are baby movies.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.670
But wait,there's more.

17:59.810 --> 18:01.240
We've got.

18:01.360 --> 18:05.270
Macaroni and glue arts and craft thingies.

18:05.590 --> 18:07.320
- Son of a -
- luke.

18:11.140 --> 18:14.350
Most importantly,though,we have.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.740
"mouse trap.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.930
" What is it?

18:21.090 --> 18:22.890
It's only the coolest game ever,man.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.550
I think it's busted.

18:26.550 --> 18:27.860
What else you got?

18:28.470 --> 18:29.410
What do you got in mind?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.050
The game is five-card draw.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.420
One-eyed jacks are wild.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.590
Ante up.

18:34.410 --> 18:35.970
Is this like "go fish"?

18:36.560 --> 18:39.100
It's like taking candy from a 5-year-olD.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.110
chase!What's going on,man?

18:57.270 --> 19:01.030
I had two bartenders call in sick,
and I had no idea it was karaoke night.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.320
Does mia know?

19:03.790 --> 19:04.660
I haven't seen her.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.030
She's coming,though,right?

19:06.180 --> 19:07.440
Say she was coming?

19:10.030 --> 19:11.290
I hate first dates.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.320
god I love first dates.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.190
Long island iced tea,please.

19:39.020 --> 19:40.900
You look amazing.

19:41.250 --> 19:41.910
Thanks.

19:41.990 --> 19:44.190
There's this cool new thing called an iron.

19:45.710 --> 19:46.480
You look busy.

19:46.830 --> 19:48.740
Long story.Working on it,though.

19:48.890 --> 19:50.180
Mind if we hang here for a while?

19:50.320 --> 19:51.180
Sure.

19:51.570 --> 19:53.840
Just don't tell the manager I'm underage.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.470
Done.Thanks.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.560
Did I mention how hot you look?

19:58.910 --> 20:00.090
You diD.

20:00.590 --> 20:01.960
Totally the iron.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.280
Totally yoU.

20:04.940 --> 20:06.190
Be right back.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.480
I think we had a deal.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.480
Never try to bluff a bluffer,uncle lucas.

20:25.370 --> 20:27.990
Okay.Are you boys tired yet?

20:29.850 --> 20:30.750
You're funny.

20:31.190 --> 20:32.400
What's next?

20:43.770 --> 20:45.300
dude,you're killing me.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.900
Come on,man,I'm on a datE.

20:51.060 --> 20:52.780
You're gonna make me look like a total loseR.

20:58.180 --> 20:59.040
There you go.

21:02.550 --> 21:04.280
Faster,they're coming.

21:06.860 --> 21:07.860
Hey,boyS.

21:10.380 --> 21:13.280
Wow,did you just actually beat nathan?

21:13.380 --> 21:15.060
Yeah,I guess I did.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.490
He kind of sucks.

21:19.270 --> 21:20.850
Play again.I want to watch!

21:20.920 --> 21:23.960
I think getting schooled once is all my ego can take.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.250
Well,mia and I just signed up for karaoke.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.410
You two signed up for karaoke?

21:30.110 --> 21:33.890
That's like kobe and lebron signing up
for a two-on-two rec-league basketball tournament.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.550
That's completely unfair.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.410
All right,let's see what you got.

21:45.660 --> 21:48.870
Sketches of costumes for business meeting,checK.

21:49.220 --> 21:55.720
Slightly moody lighting in case I have totally lost my mojo
and this is actually a date,check.

21:56.110 --> 21:57.130
Okay.

21:57.520 --> 22:01.390
Beer says "come on in,get comfortable,let's talk business.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.540
" Wine says o me.

22:06.170 --> 22:07.540
" Hard liquor it iS.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.120
Okay.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.630
Okay,right.

22:20.830 --> 22:26.540
Yeah,well,let's just make sure we're paying the minimums,
'cause the last thing we need is the union on our asS.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.650
Uh,were you just on your way out?

22:30.730 --> 22:32.370
We were meeting tonight,right?

22:32.530 --> 22:36.610
Yeah.I-I had a charity thing.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.690
Earlier.

22:39.610 --> 22:41.580
I'm readto roll up my sleeves and get to worK.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.580
Just let me take some of this.

22:43.740 --> 22:44.800
Thank you.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.460
Can I get you anything to drink?

22:47.540 --> 22:49.970
Actually,I brought us some wine.I hope that's okay.

22:52.300 --> 22:53.820
Wine is perfecT.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.350
I went by your house a couple times.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.260
Child services keeps showing up,looking for me.

23:09.890 --> 23:13.530
If it helps,I've dealt with them a lot,
and they tend to clock out at around 5:00.

23:16.860 --> 23:17.950
Have you eaten?

23:19.050 --> 23:20.300
No.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.700
Nice.

23:25.210 --> 23:27.700
It's fast food.It's just like mama used to make.

23:47.530 --> 23:53.200
Ladies and gentlemen,next up,we've got two enormous talents.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.670
Unfortunately,their talent ain't singing.

23:55.830 --> 24:00.370
Please give it up for nathan scott and chase,the new bartender guy.

24:00.780 --> 24:02.300
I told you I'd signed up for karaoke.

24:02.380 --> 24:04.340
I just didn't say who we signed up.

24:05.850 --> 24:07.230
Kobe and lebron.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.450
Kobe and lebron.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.550

How could time possibly be moving so slowly?

26:40.630 --> 26:42.120
They're kids,lucas.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.650
They need to be entertained every single secondof every single daY.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.880
How would you feel about a paternity test?

26:50.340 --> 26:51.320
I tell you what.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.340
Why don't you go get some ice cream,and I'll play hide-and-seek?

26:54.490 --> 26:56.340
You want to feed those little monsters ice cream?

26:56.450 --> 26:57.670
Oh,no,no,no.

26:57.740 --> 27:00.450
The ice cream is for me because I am pregnant.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.750
I am craving,and if mama ain't happy,ain't nobody happy.

27:05.300 --> 27:06.360

All right,here I come!You better have really good hiding spots!

27:18.510 --> 27:19.610
Hi.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.700
Are you drunk?

27:23.440 --> 27:25.530
I thought I meant so much more to you.

27:26.460 --> 27:27.830
I was your frienD.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.770
and partner.

27:30.320 --> 27:31.530
and friend.

27:31.730 --> 27:32.560
Yeah,you said that one alreadY.

27:32.680 --> 27:36.050
But if all you cared about was sex,you can have me,marvin.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.940
If that will fix things,just have all the sex with me you want.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.240
Millicent.

27:41.980 --> 27:43.530

lettermen jackets,and a lot of jeans.

Well,clearly,you have this under control.

28:13.310 --> 28:16.330
Well,brooke davis will be particularly easy to dress.

28:16.460 --> 28:18.850
Why,because she spent most of high school naked?

28:19.280 --> 28:20.920
No,jerk.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.470
Because I still have all of her clothes.

28:23.890 --> 28:26.470
And I don't care what it says in your little script.

28:27.490 --> 28:29.600
You don't know me well enough to judge me.

28:29.890 --> 28:34.140
Well,actually,I feel like I do know yoU.

28:34.650 --> 28:36.230
Why?Because I'm so transparent?

28:36.330 --> 28:38.480
No.Because of the book.

28:38.610 --> 28:41.660
You know,truth be told,I read it because of peyton,but.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.900
I related to i because of you.

28:50.550 --> 28:51.980
More wine?

28:55.200 --> 28:59.610
They're eventually gonna find me,those family-services people.

29:01.490 --> 29:02.740
Look on the bright sidE.

29:03.210 --> 29:05.830
Whoever they put you with couldn't be as bad as your brotheR.

29:07.670 --> 29:10.380
Well,at least I knew what texpe with hiM.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.640
He was still my brotheR.

29:17.970 --> 29:21.810
What did you do when they were gonna come take you away again?

29:23.840 --> 29:30.290
Usually I'd just pretend sharon and ozzy osbourne were gonna
be my next parents and that they'd let me pick out a dog.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.080
When that got old,I woulD.

29:40.580 --> 29:42.830
hold my own hand.

29:43.330 --> 29:44.810
like thiS.

29:45.300 --> 29:51.450
Pretend it was somebody else's holding mine,
somebody who actually cared where I was going.

29:57.660 --> 30:00.440
I only did that 'cause no one else was there to do it.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.470
but you've got mE.

30:13.140 --> 30:17.210
Hey,all I'm saying is dating a girl on the road is not easy.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.160
She says she's back in tree hill a lot.

30:19.220 --> 30:21.930
Well,yeah,but when she's gone,she's a rock star.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.470
She's in sexy clubs with alcohol.

30:24.590 --> 30:28.000
I mean,just thinking about that stuff will fry your brain.

30:28.970 --> 30:30.340
I can handle it.

30:31.310 --> 30:32.760
Godspeed,my friend.

30:34.170 --> 30:35.030
Oh,and one more thing.

30:35.110 --> 30:39.810
If she ever meets a guy named chris keller,
you punch first and ask questions later.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.490
Got it.

30:50.940 --> 30:52.820
so,I take it you like him?

30:52.930 --> 30:55.090
Oh,my god,he's so cute!

30:55.250 --> 30:56.580
And sweet,too.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.460
Yeah.See,first dates aren't so scary.

30:58.580 --> 30:59.830
Totally not scary.

31:00.180 --> 31:04.100
In fact,if you and hubs want to get lost,
I think we might be ready to fly solo.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.840
Just make it look natural.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.450
- All right.
- Mm-kay?

31:18.570 --> 31:20.960
hey We should get out of here soon.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.240
Lucas called,and jamie's getting homesick.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.570
Really?

31:25.470 --> 31:27.960
No.Mia just wants to be alone with chase.
It's the best I could come up with.

31:28.070 --> 31:29.410
Nice.Thank you.

31:30.860 --> 31:32.340
Have a good night.

31:32.700 --> 31:33.640
ByE.

31:42.650 --> 31:43.570
What's next?

31:43.680 --> 31:44.550
Yeah,what's next?!

31:44.670 --> 31:50.040
Oh,next,we are gonna play kill uncle lucasjust as soon as he -- hi!

31:50.200 --> 31:51.420
Kill uncle lucas!

31:55.910 --> 31:57.210
What's in the bag?

31:57.370 --> 31:59.840
Only the coolest thing ever.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.130
What is it?

32:04.420 --> 32:05.360
walkie-talkies.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.080
Sweet!

32:07.160 --> 32:08.100
Awesome!

32:09.710 --> 32:13.030
When I was little,I always wanted a brother to play walkie-talkies witH.

32:13.110 --> 32:14.250
That's sweet.

32:14.470 --> 32:15.330
Oh,yeah?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.640
Oh,that is sweet.

32:18.350 --> 32:22.340
One of us should probably keep an eye on them just to
make sure they don't get in any troublE.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.450
Got that one covered.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.580
Oh,my baby thinks of everything!

32:30.320 --> 32:32.010
You think 're gonna be okay at this?

32:32.620 --> 32:35.470
Your uncle lucas and aunt peyton are the coolesT.

32:35.550 --> 32:36.220
I know.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.880
Hey,you go under the bed,and I'll go in the closeT.

32:40.840 --> 32:41.970
Yeah.

32:42.290 --> 32:44.090
I think we're gonna be fine.

32:52.540 --> 32:53.830
I love you.

33:00.340 --> 33:05.580
so,I drop-kicked the company to my mother,
and I washed my hands of everything.

33:05.740 --> 33:08.910
I admire you,letting it all go and starting over like that.

33:09.110 --> 33:12.830
Well,I don't know if it was brave,or if I was just a total coward.

33:13.590 --> 33:14.840
It's brave.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.270
I have a similar situation.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.440
You have an evil bitch mother?

33:19.560 --> 33:21.990
No,perennially disappointed father.

33:23.050 --> 33:29.260
I took my mom's last name so I could make it on my own,but time and again,
I go back to my dad for help.

33:29.780 --> 33:33.220
And time and again,he makes me feel like a failure.

33:34.900 --> 33:37.250
But one of these dayS.

33:39.870 --> 33:41.710
well,here's to that day.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.210
what are you still doing awake,mister?

33:59.560 --> 34:00.620
Shh.

34:00.780 --> 34:03.050
We put them down,like,an hour ago.

34:11.230 --> 34:14.949
This is so awesome. it must be amazing living your dream.

34:15.690 --> 34:17.350
Yeah,it definitely is.

34:18.760 --> 34:27.440
But you know how when you're flying over a city
and it all looks so neat and tidy,

34:27.540 --> 34:31.810
like it's different from a distance,but then once you're inside of it.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.250
it's not the samE.

34:33.530 --> 34:40.860
Yeah.Well,I should probably get you home.

34:42.190 --> 34:45.440
You know,I think I'm gonna stay and work.

34:45.620 --> 34:50.710
I kind of owe peyton a song,and,you know,
for once I might actually be inspired.

34:52.130 --> 34:54.370
But you should go.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.010
It's getting late.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.500
And you're old.

34:59.550 --> 35:02.250
Listen,I'm sorry I sort of had to work on our date.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.240
I had a great time.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.720
Good.I'm glad.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.060
Me too.

35:17.370 --> 35:19.400
- Night.
- Bye.

35:35.310 --> 35:38.160
I forgot to ask if you wanted to go out again sometime.

35:39.750 --> 35:41.240
Probably should have kissed you,huh?

36:08.030 --> 36:10.430
so,can I get you anything else?

36:10.550 --> 36:12.760
Another drink or.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.700
I'd love to,but I should probably get going.

36:18.690 --> 36:20.260
Um,this was nice,brooke.

36:20.610 --> 36:22.210
Yes,it was.

36:26.830 --> 36:28.440
Julian,what was this?

36:29.050 --> 36:30.820
Um.

36:31.090 --> 36:38.210
we should probably just say this was what it was,
'cause anything else gets complicated.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.050
PerfecT.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.210
I'll see myself out.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.300
this has to be business,right?

36:53.380 --> 36:54.910
I mean,with peyton and.

36:54.990 --> 36:56.220
this should be business.

36:56.280 --> 36:59.190
We can't just -- I mean,I kiss you,and then it gets.

36:59.230 --> 37:00.980
definitely.It would be.

37:02.390 --> 37:03.610
it would be.

37:06.070 --> 37:07.240
Yes.

37:40.810 --> 37:41.750
What happened?

37:41.870 --> 37:43.160
Here,eat these.

37:47.710 --> 37:48.850
Chalky.

37:53.890 --> 37:55.690
i'm sorry,marvin.

37:56.790 --> 37:58.120
I know.

38:02.410 --> 38:07.270
Brooke says she needs a buyer in new york for costumes.

38:09.340 --> 38:10.980
Maybe I should go.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.230
I think that might be best.

38:20.220 --> 38:21.910
You should get some sleeP.

38:38.310 --> 38:40.040
I should probably get going home.

38:42.580 --> 38:43.910
Must be nice.

38:45.950 --> 38:47.430
I could ask brooke.

38:48.260 --> 38:49.740
my brother attacked her.

38:51.640 --> 38:54.140
Besides,I mean,you got a good thing going on there.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.750
Listen,um.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.310
I probably won't see you for a while.

39:06.880 --> 39:11.850
- But it -- it doesn't mean that.
- hey.Listen.

39:14.080 --> 39:17.210
Sometimes,these foster-home things work out,okay?

39:18.250 --> 39:19.460
Yeah.

39:20.070 --> 39:21.420
Sometimes.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.040
I'll see you.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.180
Hey,luke.You there?

39:39.340 --> 39:40.580
Wake up.OveR.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.430
nathan,is that you?

39:48.810 --> 39:49.830
Yeah,man.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.860
These walkie-talkies were a stroke of genius.

39:52.020 --> 39:54.020
Jamie loved his so much,he went to bed with it.

39:54.690 --> 39:55.390
Oh,my god.Jamie.

39:55.690 --> 39:57.200
Don't sweat it.

39:57.330 --> 39:58.740
We picked them up.They're fine.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.690
Speaking of which,I heard a rumor you're gonna be a daD.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.530
That's pretty cool,man.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.600
Yeah.

40:10.300 --> 40:13.330
Kind of overwhelmed.I don't know how you do it.I'm exhausted.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.440
It's all about teamwork.

40:15.860 --> 40:18.340
You see that girl lying there next to you?

40:18.930 --> 40:20.890
Well,you don't know it now,but.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.270
she's a superhero.

40:23.390 --> 40:24.490
Trust me.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.820
And anyway,we're both here for you,man.

40:27.890 --> 40:29.270
Whatever you neeD.

40:29.580 --> 40:31.260
I just want you to know that.

40:31.980 --> 40:33.500
Thanks,man.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.770
Have a good nighT.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.100
What's going on?

40:42.940 --> 40:45.600
Just playing walkie-talkies with my brother.

40:46.590 --> 40:48.120
That's nice.

40:48.370 --> 40:50.290
The boys had fun,right?

40:50.920 --> 40:52.130
Yeah,I think so.

40:52.290 --> 40:56.040
'Kay.And I'm gonna be a good mom,right?

40:56.130 --> 40:57.430
I know sO.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.690
And our kid's gonna be great,right?

41:03.380 --> 41:04.650
The greatest.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.510
