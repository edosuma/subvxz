01:07.850 --> 01:09.693
I've never belonged to a club.

01:09.974 --> 01:12.355
I mean, I get them, I just
don't want to be in them.

01:12.780 --> 01:14.038
Like book clubs.

01:14.203 --> 01:16.892
"Hey,  check out how smart
we are.  We can read."

01:16.983 --> 01:18.283
Shut up, already.

01:18.498 --> 01:20.709
And bicycle clubs. What's that about?

01:20.849 --> 01:23.505
One guy in a bad outfit, you're a tool.

01:23.577 --> 01:27.089
Four guys in the same goofy
shirt, suddenly, you're the shit?

01:27.142 --> 01:28.124
Give me a break.

01:28.892 --> 01:31.882
My parents always told me
to join some club at school,

01:31.919 --> 01:33.976
any club at all, just pick a card,

01:34.140 --> 01:38.222
but I didn't, and then
a club finally picked me.

01:38.785 --> 01:41.189
I don't think this is what
my parents had in mind.

01:41.241 --> 01:43.901
- Did you rob a grave or something?
- No.

01:44.585 --> 01:48.019
I was combing through somebody's garbage
looking for their credit card receipts.

01:50.227 --> 01:51.606
That's teriyaki sauce. Here, smell.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.568
Not while I'm eating.

01:52.618 --> 01:56.324
Well, your fingernails
could use a little spa time.

01:56.447 --> 01:57.656
Aw, thanks.

01:59.084 --> 02:00.630
Not while I'm eating.

02:00.712 --> 02:02.069
Oh, bloody hell.

02:02.130 --> 02:04.925
Sorry, I didn't think you
would do that at the table.

02:04.982 --> 02:06.841
I can't win with you people, can't I?

02:07.015 --> 02:08.971
You're moaning about
my personal hygiene.

02:09.002 --> 02:10.604
You're going on about my etiquette.

02:10.823 --> 02:12.125
I can't fucking win.

02:12.277 --> 02:14.731
Mason, if you weren't a reaper,
where would you be right now?

02:14.775 --> 02:15.309
Dead.

02:15.372 --> 02:17.342
- But if you weren't dead.
- I'd be dead.

02:17.524 --> 02:19.193
I'd be back in college,

02:19.932 --> 02:20.982
a sophomore.

02:21.121 --> 02:22.728
It's enough to make
you glad you're dead.

02:29.934 --> 02:32.153
It's too early for
this crap. We're moving.

02:32.261 --> 02:33.153
We've ordered.

02:33.659 --> 02:36.710
They'll figure out. They're
really smart here. Let's go.

02:45.174 --> 02:46.147
What can I get for you?

02:46.680 --> 02:47.989
Nothing, Kiffany, thank you.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.638
- You're not ordering breakfast today?
- No, I've had breakfast.

02:52.137 --> 02:53.293
Where did you eat?

02:53.400 --> 02:55.061
Hungry Pete's, just down the street.

02:55.116 --> 02:57.728
Escape from routine,
it is good for the soul.

02:58.001 --> 02:58.916
How was it?

02:59.140 --> 02:59.811
Awful.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.332
Never going back.

03:02.709 --> 03:05.343
A ticket to Cancun, first
class? Are you shitting me?

03:05.484 --> 03:07.554
There's a post-it on it, dumb ass.

03:07.614 --> 03:10.240
If you are putting me on a plane
that's going down, I swear to god--

03:10.272 --> 03:12.027
I can't swim, Rube. That's not funny.

03:12.094 --> 03:13.942
There's one post-it each.

03:13.978 --> 03:17.275
Odds are there are more than
two people on that plane.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.106
Odds are if the plane goes
down, everyone's going to die.

03:20.173 --> 03:22.942
Odds are that plane ain't going down.

03:23.066 --> 03:24.504
President of the math club?

03:24.576 --> 03:26.225
Just smarter than Mason.

03:26.531 --> 03:28.642
- Really?
- Well, look at you...

03:29.574 --> 03:31.304
What's the Montgomery club?

03:31.416 --> 03:35.958
Old-line country club, beautiful
golf course, old money, big money.

03:36.039 --> 03:36.977
Money money.

03:37.202 --> 03:39.484
Don't get lost on the green.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.081
She gets a vip reap last
week, and this week...

03:42.316 --> 03:44.933
Montgomery club? It's just not fair.

03:45.015 --> 03:46.776
Well, that's not my call.

03:47.017 --> 03:48.103
Humor me?

03:48.367 --> 03:49.843
Give yourself extra time.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.854
See how that other half lives.

03:52.116 --> 03:53.898
Isn't that what I've been doing?

03:53.975 --> 03:54.845
Nothing for me today?

03:54.895 --> 03:56.119
No, nothing for you today.

03:56.585 --> 03:57.559
What's yours?

03:57.758 --> 04:02.376
Me, I've got a 1019 West
Slane street outside room 216.

04:02.433 --> 04:04.731
Sounds like a hotel. Maybe a murder.

04:04.788 --> 04:05.495
Maybe.

04:05.726 --> 04:06.938
I'm kind of in the mood for a murder.

04:10.035 --> 04:11.776
What is this?

04:11.857 --> 04:17.192
That, my dear, is the very same
organic whole grain banana nut bread

04:17.260 --> 04:18.815
that won me a blue ribbon

04:18.882 --> 04:22.667
at the New Mexico state fair in 1975.

04:23.015 --> 04:24.468
Why were you in New Mexico?

04:24.756 --> 04:27.976
I was managing a llama
ranch outside of Santa Fe.

04:29.925 --> 04:31.395
It smells bad.

04:31.456 --> 04:33.889
Are you always so afraid
of trying something new?

04:33.965 --> 04:36.106
If I think it came
out of a llama's butt.

04:36.712 --> 04:37.575
Fine.

04:38.450 --> 04:39.562
Be a conformist.

04:39.776 --> 04:41.073
Have Cap'n Crunch.

04:41.153 --> 04:43.177
Mom never told me she
lived on a llama ranch.

04:43.243 --> 04:44.780
That's because mom never did.

04:44.842 --> 04:46.371
Your mom was in the seventh grade

04:46.428 --> 04:50.442
while her mom was 800 miles
away spreading her wings.

04:50.709 --> 04:53.871
Santa Fe was so beautiful.

04:54.072 --> 04:56.100
You and your sister would have loved it.

04:56.182 --> 04:57.139
I want to go.

04:57.199 --> 05:00.813
Honey, my life is filled with stories.

05:01.293 --> 05:06.154
Stories don't happen to
people who just stay inside.

05:06.211 --> 05:09.405
- Reggie, go get ready for school.
- I want to hear more stories.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.320
After school.

05:11.448 --> 05:14.970
Did you know that your
grandmother once did time?

05:15.031 --> 05:17.004
- You were in jail?
- Mom...

05:19.148 --> 05:20.280
Did you steal something?

05:20.373 --> 05:25.236
I was in jail because Richard
Nixon was a liar and an asshole.

05:25.572 --> 05:27.940
All right. Reggie? Now.

05:34.048 --> 05:37.472
- That so does not work for me.
- What?

05:37.526 --> 05:41.230
I  can't listen to you tell story
after story about your selfishness

05:41.292 --> 05:43.873
and then call it a life philosophy.

05:43.954 --> 05:46.735
I was a concerned american citizen.

05:46.807 --> 05:48.818
I wanted the White
House to hear my voice.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.573
I  was 11. I wanted a
ride home from school.

05:51.635 --> 05:54.509
So tell me, Joy, did you get
home from school that day?

05:54.553 --> 05:57.465
You cannot, in front of
an impressionable child,

05:57.584 --> 05:59.765
brag about going to jail.

06:00.686 --> 06:02.428
She's 12. She can handle it.

06:03.257 --> 06:04.521
She's 11,

06:04.644 --> 06:05.974
and that's not your call.

06:06.876 --> 06:08.934
So are you picking me
up after school, grandma?

06:13.066 --> 06:13.981
Absolutely.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.124
Okay. Bye.

06:15.841 --> 06:18.447
We'll have an adventure,
something weird.

06:18.617 --> 06:19.374
Cool.

06:23.588 --> 06:25.891
Little girls love adventures.

06:26.390 --> 06:29.014
At least, most of them do.

06:29.066 --> 06:30.751
You run away your whole life,

06:30.802 --> 06:33.787
and then you parade it around
you like a badge of honor.

06:33.829 --> 06:34.667
It's just beyond me.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.902
I don't run away. I run towards.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.537
Oh, pretty.

06:40.104 --> 06:42.598
Why don't you needle-point
that on a pillow for me, huh?

06:42.654 --> 06:44.522
- It's not my thing.
- No.

06:44.959 --> 06:48.414
You don't stick around anywhere long
enough to do that kind of project, do you?

06:48.541 --> 06:50.647
I invited you to Italy. You said no.

06:50.712 --> 06:53.498
Mother, you don't invite
a fourth grader to Italy.

06:53.557 --> 06:55.285
You either take them
or you don't. Right?

06:55.321 --> 06:56.703
I mean, make a fucking choice.

07:01.229 --> 07:04.281
- I'm not that girl.
- Not what girl?

07:04.460 --> 07:07.255
The girl Clancy is sleeping with.

07:08.417 --> 07:11.469
Stop taking it out on me.

07:13.539 --> 07:15.447
- Where are you going?
- Away from you.

07:17.709 --> 07:20.311
I guess when you want to
run away from your life,

07:20.767 --> 07:23.987
you just make a break for
it and hope no one's looking.

07:34.611 --> 07:35.568
Hey, Reggie.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.864
Imagine yourself on
the island of Komodo,

07:38.963 --> 07:42.234
face to face with the terrifying
dragon that roams its shores.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.677
That's a Komodo dragon?

07:43.791 --> 07:46.770
Yeah, I'm showing my dragon to
several classes this morning.

07:47.117 --> 07:49.134
Would you like to be my assistant?

07:49.438 --> 07:50.590
What do I have to do?

07:50.743 --> 07:52.226
Just stand there and look pretty.

07:54.871 --> 07:57.093
- Can I touch it?
- Don't be absurd.

07:57.174 --> 07:59.207
The Komodo dragon is
a dangerous carnivore.

07:59.466 --> 08:01.751
He'll eat you like you're
a piece of turkey baloney,

08:01.839 --> 08:04.424
which, in case you're all
curious, is his favorite.

08:04.511 --> 08:06.308
- What's his name?
- Frodo.

08:06.593 --> 08:08.674
- Who?
- Like the hobbit.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.031
- Have you been dead for the last 6 years?
- Seven.

08:14.350 --> 08:17.337
I'm not going to hurt him.
I just want to pet him.

08:17.418 --> 08:19.896
Frodo hurting you is
the more likely scenario.

08:20.470 --> 08:23.050
So, Reggie, do you
want to be my assistant?

08:23.428 --> 08:25.537
Mrs. Brody said I could pick anybody.

08:26.510 --> 08:28.256
- Sure.
- Yes!

08:33.546 --> 08:36.648
- Goldilocks likes you.
- His name is Francis.

08:58.696 --> 09:00.184
Please put it somewhere safe.

09:00.237 --> 09:02.454
This dent happened the
last time I was here.

09:09.724 --> 09:10.537
May I help you?

09:11.427 --> 09:17.234
I'm looking for information on the
intra-country club women's golf league.

09:17.451 --> 09:20.644
We don't have an intra-country
club women's golf league.

09:21.209 --> 09:24.792
Which is why I'm here, to talk to
someone about getting one started.

09:24.853 --> 09:26.205
Miss, this is a private club.

09:26.310 --> 09:28.826
I was told to ask for a...

09:30.479 --> 09:31.565
T. Hesburgh?

09:31.631 --> 09:32.651
I'm very sorry, miss.

09:33.218 --> 09:34.191
Members only.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.070
Well, Hesburgh invited me here,

09:36.131 --> 09:38.032
and now I'm here,

09:38.190 --> 09:41.609
so if you want to turn me
away, that's on you, dear sir,

09:41.682 --> 09:44.758
but Hesburgh won't like
it. Heads could roll.

09:46.100 --> 09:46.997
Roll.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.127
She can sit with me.

09:50.554 --> 09:51.380
Very good, sir.

09:55.284 --> 09:57.118
I...I know mr. Hesburgh.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.780
He's out on the back nine. You
can take a seat if you want.

09:59.949 --> 10:02.997
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

10:03.159 --> 10:03.886
Cute.

10:04.091 --> 10:06.160
A little country clubby, but cute.

10:06.313 --> 10:06.927
I'm Trip.

10:07.505 --> 10:08.463
Of course you are.

10:08.751 --> 10:09.523
I'm George.

10:11.004 --> 10:12.078
As in Georgia?

10:13.933 --> 10:15.877
George.  That's a cute nickname.

10:16.107 --> 10:19.196
It's not a nickname... Trip.

10:21.207 --> 10:22.046
So...

10:22.349 --> 10:23.721
why do you need to see mr. Hesburgh?

10:23.778 --> 10:25.891
It's... personal.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.306
Since we're pretending
to know each other,

10:29.793 --> 10:31.489
let's pretend to like each other, too.

10:31.682 --> 10:33.239
Well, you see, the truth is, Trip,

10:33.445 --> 10:35.397
I'm a process server.

10:35.470 --> 10:36.654
He's being sued.

10:38.307 --> 10:39.013
Bummer.

10:39.961 --> 10:41.394
I work for mr. Hesburgh.

10:42.250 --> 10:42.971
Oh.

10:43.427 --> 10:45.137
Maybe you're a troublemaker too.

10:45.649 --> 10:47.733
Maybe I'd better steer clear.

10:48.931 --> 10:49.940
Okay, you do that.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.789
Children.

10:59.244 --> 11:01.783
- This isn't a hotel. It's a school.
- I can see that.

11:02.499 --> 11:03.221
Hi, buddy.

11:03.738 --> 11:07.418
- Tell me, where's room 216?
- Go fuck yourself.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.426
Kids have changed, huh?

11:10.573 --> 11:12.421
Well, it's a school, so there
are numbers on the doors.

11:12.483 --> 11:14.619
I can see that. Don't talk
to me like I'm a third grader.

11:14.696 --> 11:15.973
Let's go, you're late.
You're going to get whipped.

11:16.079 --> 11:18.315
Come on. Let's go.

11:18.402 --> 11:19.121
You have fun, now.

11:19.182 --> 11:20.507
Oh,  no, no, no, you're coming with me.

11:20.573 --> 11:22.124
- Why?
- Cause you can talk to third graders.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.534
They're going to take
the electric chair to you.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.782
You know what's going to happen to you?

11:25.979 --> 11:27.838
Well, I actually write
for his newspaper,

11:27.930 --> 11:30.315
so I have to ask the key question.

11:32.026 --> 11:33.085
Why is he being sued?

11:33.157 --> 11:35.262
The paper libelled someone.

11:35.763 --> 11:38.480
- They defamed someone's character?
- That's the same thing as libel.

11:38.580 --> 11:41.913
The paper boy kept throwing
someone's paper in the bushes?

11:42.270 --> 11:43.100
That must be it.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.760
Well, you sure are a
pretty process server.

11:47.060 --> 11:48.122
Maybe I'm lying.

11:48.277 --> 11:50.345
Maybe I'm really here
for some other reason.

11:50.873 --> 11:52.218
Well, I don't know anything about you.

11:52.428 --> 11:53.585
No, you don't.

11:53.698 --> 11:55.664
Except that you are lying
about why you're here.

11:55.875 --> 11:56.602
Right.

11:58.422 --> 11:59.601
Is your name really George?

11:59.673 --> 12:01.962
Yes. You're trip?

12:02.070 --> 12:02.832
Yes.

12:03.067 --> 12:03.949
Ivy league?

12:04.148 --> 12:05.258
Yale. You?

12:05.316 --> 12:07.199
Dropout. Siblings?

12:07.270 --> 12:08.120
Sister. You?

12:08.202 --> 12:08.868
Sister.

12:08.975 --> 12:10.124
- You live alone?
- No.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.535
-  Guy?
- Actress.

12:11.642 --> 12:12.637
- Successful?
- No.

12:13.456 --> 12:15.369
- So, you're rich?
- Trust fund.

12:15.938 --> 12:17.593
- You have pets?
- Frog.

12:17.665 --> 12:19.296
- Frog?
- Frog.

12:19.383 --> 12:21.454
Amphibian. Interesting.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.052
Favorite food?

12:24.306 --> 12:25.980
Waffles. Favorite place?

12:26.096 --> 12:26.824
Right now?

12:28.103 --> 12:28.964
Here.

12:30.141 --> 12:31.770
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:32.189 --> 12:33.592
- You lying?
- No.

12:37.496 --> 12:39.043
- Money or fame?
- Money.

12:40.053 --> 12:41.664
- Money or immortality?
- Money.

12:42.388 --> 12:43.299
Money or love?

12:46.413 --> 12:47.027
Money.

12:48.975 --> 12:49.807
Liar.

12:52.002 --> 12:52.956
Do you have a girlfriend?

12:55.385 --> 12:56.699
Do you have a boyfriend?

12:59.294 --> 13:02.151
- Are you lying?
- Not about that.

13:03.243 --> 13:04.875
- Breakfast or dinner?
- Brunch.

13:05.964 --> 13:08.550
- That was an invitation.
- Oh.

13:08.914 --> 13:11.950
Um...dinner, I guess.

13:13.516 --> 13:14.598
Dinner it is, then.

13:17.260 --> 13:20.024
Okay, Francis, are you
and your dragon all set?

13:20.166 --> 13:21.365
Yeah, I think so.

13:21.463 --> 13:23.424
- And Reggie's your assistant, right?
- Yeah.

13:24.193 --> 13:25.047
Who are you?

13:26.585 --> 13:30.618
- Are you from miss McDermott's class?
- Yeah. I'm class monitor.

13:31.329 --> 13:32.215
Okay, it's fine.

13:32.261 --> 13:34.514
Francis, since we've got the
komodo to show, I think we should--

13:35.856 --> 13:36.736
just a second.

13:37.898 --> 13:38.963
This is ridiculous.

13:39.349 --> 13:43.940
Mr. Parker, can you please check on
the commotion in there? Thank you.

13:44.272 --> 13:45.121
That's my guy.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.706
There's no teacher in there.

13:57.558 --> 13:59.211
Is one of you the second
grade substitute teacher?

13:59.274 --> 14:00.017
Yeah, he is.

14:00.456 --> 14:01.895
Why would you do that to me?

14:01.956 --> 14:03.027
I'm dead. I want to be entertained.

14:03.088 --> 14:05.499
Well, you're late. They're
going totally A.D.D.

14:05.555 --> 14:06.625
You'd better get in there now.

14:08.127 --> 14:08.878
Who's this?

14:09.033 --> 14:10.865
- She's my teacher's-- - I'm
his daughter. - My daughter.

14:10.926 --> 14:13.487
Oh, really? She doesn't
look anything like you.

14:13.670 --> 14:14.914
She's so pale.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.659
Practically a ghost.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.183
Right. Well, just...go.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.050
Was that entertaining enough for you?

14:26.332 --> 14:27.515
It's a start, daddy.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.152
I could wear a dress.
Would that be entertaining?

14:30.213 --> 14:31.754
I'd actually really like to see that.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.621
Oh, well, maybe we'll go shopping
after this. That'd be fun, wouldn't it?

14:39.785 --> 14:42.652
I told you to use your
fucking sirens on the way over.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.373
- We were nearly la...
- What the...

14:44.430 --> 14:47.459
Hi, guys. Welcome to
travel national air, TNA.

14:52.398 --> 14:53.251
My ticket.

14:56.012 --> 14:57.005
I love you.

14:59.736 --> 15:02.812
- Now, can I get you two a cocktail?
- Oh...yes.

15:03.351 --> 15:04.445
I would like...

15:05.501 --> 15:09.329
basically anything with one of those
little wooden umbrellas in it, you know?

15:09.395 --> 15:10.710
Nothing for me, thank you.

15:15.402 --> 15:18.703
Do the damn reap first,
Mason, and then get hammered.

15:18.944 --> 15:20.793
I am a high-functioning drunk.

15:24.192 --> 15:26.522
I am going to join the
mile-high club today.

15:26.579 --> 15:28.503
You've never had sex on a plane before?

15:28.667 --> 15:29.414
What?

15:30.766 --> 15:32.512
- Is that what that
means? - Mm-hmm.

15:32.563 --> 15:35.640
- What did you think it meant?
- Never mind.

15:35.686 --> 15:37.581
No, for real, tell me
what you thought it meant.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.438
Roxy, I've never flown before.
I'm a bit nervous, all right?

15:40.504 --> 15:43.238
Well, congratulations, baby. Drink up.

15:43.745 --> 15:44.483
Buckle up...

15:45.264 --> 15:46.694
and don't fuck it up.

15:48.861 --> 15:50.903
Just making them draw
pictures is a cop-out.

15:50.948 --> 15:52.280
You should actually
teach them something.

15:52.346 --> 15:54.410
- I'm not their teacher.
- You are today.

15:54.896 --> 15:57.026
You have a chance to
impact young people's lives,

15:57.087 --> 15:59.069
and it's slipping by you. It's a shame.

16:03.585 --> 16:04.399
How's this?

16:04.937 --> 16:06.635
Oh, it's very, very good.

16:06.693 --> 16:07.537
Rule of
thumb--

16:07.598 --> 16:08.596
lip
liner--

16:08.740 --> 16:11.849
you want to sketch,
honey, not draw, sketch.

16:12.176 --> 16:13.167
Thanks a lot, Daisy.

16:13.269 --> 16:13.997
Yeah.

16:14.719 --> 16:17.010
- Hi.
- Hi yourself.

16:17.071 --> 16:18.360
What are you going to teach us?

16:18.580 --> 16:20.270
Discipline. Return to your seat.

16:29.558 --> 16:30.889
All right, stop drawing.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.923
I want you to look up at
these four pictures up here.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.377
What do all these things have in common?

16:41.077 --> 16:41.850
You.

16:41.890 --> 16:42.746
They can all swim.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.265
Bats don't swim. Anyone else?

16:45.368 --> 16:48.164
They all...eat meat?

16:48.436 --> 16:50.027
Beavers eat plants. Anyone else?

16:50.412 --> 16:52.393
Anyone who might get into college?

16:53.834 --> 16:55.874
And I'm talking state school.

16:57.363 --> 16:58.209
Yes?

16:58.966 --> 17:00.149
They all die.

17:00.682 --> 17:02.488
- What's your name?
- Sara.

17:02.539 --> 17:06.810
That's right, Sara, they all
die. Everything and everyone dies.

17:12.686 --> 17:13.660
I'm kidding.

17:14.107 --> 17:14.761
I'm kidding.

17:16.476 --> 17:17.684
They're all mammals.

17:19.087 --> 17:22.737
Who can describe the
characteristics of a mammal?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.771
- Yeah?
- They can all fly.

17:28.308 --> 17:32.103
Jesus, Jessie, work with daisy
on your lip gloss. Anybody else?

17:33.812 --> 17:34.671
Miss Daisy?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.072
All mammals, like
people, are warm-blooded.

17:38.139 --> 17:41.117
Well, yes, they are. Let's
hear it for miss Daisy.

17:41.743 --> 17:42.599
Very good.

17:46.379 --> 17:49.253
- Kids actually like you, Rube.
- Oh, I know.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.153
It's baffling, isn't it?

17:53.524 --> 17:57.112
- Hi. What are you doing?
- Paying bills.

17:57.645 --> 17:59.924
Oh...oh.

18:01.603 --> 18:03.651
This water bill is awfully high.

18:03.860 --> 18:06.164
You and Reggie flush every time out?

18:06.247 --> 18:08.966
You know, mother, I'm lucky
if I even get to go at all.

18:09.042 --> 18:12.151
I'll  bet you and reggie flush
twice as much as you need to.

18:12.187 --> 18:13.169
Okay, you know what, mom?

18:13.220 --> 18:16.019
Paying bills is hard enough
without the play-by-play.

18:16.875 --> 18:19.716
I really think you should
try getting out of the house.

18:19.773 --> 18:21.981
You know, I was just
thinking that about you.

18:22.031 --> 18:25.328
You're all straight lines
and right angles, Joy.

18:25.468 --> 18:29.067
If you don't loosen up, you're never
going to hold another penis again.

18:31.596 --> 18:34.683
Why do you keep running away from me?

18:39.181 --> 18:41.897
We'll be on our way momentarily,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:41.943 --> 18:44.026
We're just waiting
for some late arrivals.

18:44.134 --> 18:45.653
Did you bring your sunscreen, Roxy?

18:45.757 --> 18:47.733
- I'm black.
- Oh, right.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.944
Black people tan, you bozo.

18:51.737 --> 18:54.461
I have spf 15 if you want to use it.

18:54.558 --> 18:56.263
- Champagne?
- Ah, yes.

18:56.405 --> 18:57.579
Uh, no, thank you.

18:57.733 --> 19:00.678
Missy, you look so familiar
to me. What's your last name?

19:00.764 --> 19:04.105
- Balabanian. It's armenian.
- Oh, my mistake.

19:04.541 --> 19:05.587
Nice bracelet.

19:05.692 --> 19:07.126
Oh, it was my grandmother's.

19:07.471 --> 19:11.158
- Wow, it's beautiful.
- Thank you.

19:11.242 --> 19:13.102
I love that armenian craftsmanship.

19:15.065 --> 19:16.860
I will have that champagne now.

19:16.937 --> 19:18.398
- Okay.
- Good for you, Roxy.

19:18.474 --> 19:20.189
Finally letting go and relaxing.

19:21.102 --> 19:23.727
- That's a damn shame.
- What is?

19:23.776 --> 19:27.310
That pretty armenian girl is going to
die looking like an in-flight hooker.

19:27.638 --> 19:31.709
- Hmm, at least she got to see the world.
- Looking like a hooker.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.702
- There you go.
- Thank you.

19:35.697 --> 19:37.934
I seem to have dropped
my ticket on the floor.

19:38.035 --> 19:41.030
I'm really-- I'm sorry
about that. I just...

19:42.641 --> 19:43.815
There you go, clumsy.

19:45.356 --> 19:47.877
And at least I got to see that.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.328
- You're tragic.
- I suppose I am.

19:55.024 --> 19:57.491
Okay, everyone, settle down, please.

19:59.724 --> 20:04.312
We have something very special
to share with you today,

20:04.469 --> 20:08.889
a very special report on the
Komodo dragon by Francis Bischetti.

20:15.437 --> 20:21.003
"The komodo dragon, or varanus
komodoensis," by Francis Bischetti.

20:21.428 --> 20:25.610
The komodo is found exclusively on
the indonesian islands of Komodo,

20:25.774 --> 20:28.774
Rintja, Padar, Gili, and Mota.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.954
It hunts by ambush and
seizes with its jaws.

20:32.024 --> 20:34.744
- Dragon kills janitor.
- Possibility.

20:34.821 --> 20:36.940
It can bite a man's hand right off.

20:40.778 --> 20:43.335
They live free in the
wild, beholden to no man.

20:48.730 --> 20:50.103
Oh, my god.

20:51.170 --> 20:51.798
That's us.

21:06.216 --> 21:08.202
What in the name of Jesus?

21:09.872 --> 21:12.394
Go back to hell, you beast.
You won't touch my children.

21:14.842 --> 21:16.175
Don't hurt Frodo!

21:21.816 --> 21:22.625
I got it.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.957
Did they catch it?

21:34.977 --> 21:36.142
Fi--fire
drill.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.005
Fire drill, two lines out the door.

21:49.213 --> 21:53.145
- Damn. Did I kill something endangered?
- You did.

21:53.272 --> 21:56.359
Shit. I'm a member of the Sierra club.

21:56.607 --> 22:00.148
Well...it was in self-defense.

22:00.929 --> 22:03.974
Yeah. It's not like it was
something cute, like a baby seal.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.569
There you go. This looks promising.

22:18.948 --> 22:19.600
Why?

22:20.187 --> 22:22.941
Newlyweds-- accident
prone, obviously.

22:26.931 --> 22:29.623
- Okay, there you go.
- Thanks, Missy.

22:29.710 --> 22:32.655
- Oh, I've got no umbrella?
- They're a security risk.

22:32.870 --> 22:35.129
You can't be too careful. Can't you?

22:35.185 --> 22:37.119
- What's the movie?
- Four weddings and a funeral.

22:37.703 --> 22:38.764
Close enough.

22:39.830 --> 22:40.985
Hey, wait!

22:43.370 --> 22:44.931
Why are you stalking me?

22:45.902 --> 22:47.501
You're the stalker.

22:48.060 --> 22:48.899
Go away.

22:50.731 --> 22:52.621
Why did you touch that dragon?

22:53.216 --> 22:55.781
I'm a dragon slayer. Now go away.

22:57.537 --> 23:00.250
- I saw you steal from that girl.
- Good for you.

23:02.222 --> 23:03.461
Want some chocolate milk?

23:06.819 --> 23:07.438
Sure.

23:16.275 --> 23:18.308
Aren't you going to get in
trouble for ditching school?

23:19.152 --> 23:20.331
Aren't you?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.267
I don't have school.

23:24.995 --> 23:26.574
Well, what do you do all day?

23:27.872 --> 23:31.554
I'm a dragon slayer. I told
you. Now stop following me.

23:32.992 --> 23:34.498
Do you know a girl named George?

23:37.404 --> 23:39.033
Was she killed by a toilet seat?

23:40.548 --> 23:42.096
Yeah, I've heard of her.

23:50.827 --> 23:52.387
You're a brave girl.

23:53.519 --> 23:56.560
So George stays in, I
suspect, with nothing.

23:56.616 --> 23:59.965
I just don't want to miss
mr. Hesburgh when he shows up.

24:00.481 --> 24:03.001
I told you I'd point him out to
you when he comes in off the 18th.

24:04.746 --> 24:08.787
- I bet five bucks.
- Five bucks? Where are we, Vegas?

24:08.950 --> 24:10.301
Well, that's the glory of poker.

24:10.445 --> 24:12.457
My dad always says, "it
has to hurt a little bit."

24:12.534 --> 24:14.167
Otherwise, bets don't matter,

24:14.941 --> 24:18.279
so, George, are you going
to call, raise, or fold?

24:18.592 --> 24:19.461
Fold.

24:21.631 --> 24:22.978
Hmm...mistake.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.637
I had a pair of kings.

24:24.734 --> 24:26.624
Well, actually, you had trip kings.

24:26.941 --> 24:29.170
Two in the pocket and
one showing on the board.

24:29.865 --> 24:32.164
It's three kings... trips.

24:32.953 --> 24:36.255
Trip, trip, trip, you are really cute.

24:36.316 --> 24:39.634
- You bluffed me.
- Yeah, it's the story of my life.

24:40.581 --> 24:42.742
Sir. How is everything?

24:43.068 --> 24:44.979
It's lovely. How are you?

24:45.071 --> 24:46.786
Lovely, and you, miss?

24:46.944 --> 24:47.661
Lovely.

24:47.743 --> 24:51.071
Enough with the fucking
"lovely."  Talk like men.

24:51.142 --> 24:53.161
The golf course has never
been in better shape.

24:53.227 --> 24:56.452
If we could just get old man Gibson to stop
driving his cart through the sand traps.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.228
Good one, sir.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.243
Call me if you need anything.

25:00.681 --> 25:03.313
Yeah, if he needs someone
further up his ass.

25:03.487 --> 25:06.532
You know, for someone who
supposedly hates country club life,

25:06.593 --> 25:08.053
you seem pretty comfortable.

25:10.557 --> 25:11.531
I hate it.

25:12.641 --> 25:13.446
Why?

25:15.053 --> 25:17.250
Absolutely no surprises.

25:17.807 --> 25:19.799
I hear the same nonsense
every time I walk in--

25:19.958 --> 25:21.965
"isn't that a lovely dress?"

25:22.078 --> 25:24.700
"Man, the 14th just ate me up today."

25:24.817 --> 25:26.316
"Another bombay martini, sir?"

25:26.916 --> 25:28.709
It's like you know everything

25:28.754 --> 25:30.714
everyone's going to
do before they do it.

25:35.811 --> 25:36.818
Except for that.

25:43.951 --> 25:46.120
We still have four planes ahead of us,

25:46.166 --> 25:47.856
but until we get off the ground,

25:48.051 --> 25:50.826
Missy and Sparkle will
be happy to distract you.

25:52.090 --> 25:55.112
Open your bag, open your bag, open
your bag, open your bag, open your bag.

25:57.188 --> 25:59.632
Concentrate on your post-it, Mason.

25:59.693 --> 26:02.975
- Maybe I'm not a very good flier.
- You're not a very good reaper.

26:04.268 --> 26:08.934
Mrs... Tanya Diller.

26:09.370 --> 26:13.686
Mrs... Bernard... Diller.

26:14.827 --> 26:18.366
- Which one do you like best?
- Oh, both of them.

26:18.942 --> 26:20.250
Can I offer you a snack?

26:20.327 --> 26:23.633
No, get those peanuts far away
from my baby. He's totally allergic.

26:25.307 --> 26:26.895
Always looking out for me, babe.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.463
- Love you.
- Love you more.

26:30.772 --> 26:32.610
Bernard Diller, it's Bernard Diller.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.326
He's dead.

26:33.806 --> 26:37.740
Good, because I can't stand watching
that tonsil hockey all the way to Cancun.

26:38.271 --> 26:38.901
I can.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.331
Busted.

26:48.547 --> 26:51.860
More champagne, please.
Account number 1835.

26:54.464 --> 26:56.207
You're a quick study, George...

26:56.781 --> 26:57.867
who has no last name.

26:57.993 --> 26:58.787
I have one.

26:58.875 --> 27:01.720
You're just not a clever enough
reporter to figure it out.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.024
Who said I was a reporter?

27:04.122 --> 27:06.037
So you don't write for the newspaper?

27:06.385 --> 27:07.905
You were lying to me.

27:08.064 --> 27:10.696
I work for the newspaper,
but I'm not a reporter.

27:11.423 --> 27:12.780
I actually write obits.

27:13.978 --> 27:15.309
I read obits.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.356
- I write them.
- I read them.

27:17.423 --> 27:19.086
Well, we have that in common, then.

27:19.214 --> 27:20.399
- Death-fixated.
- No way.

27:23.136 --> 27:25.185
Deaths celebrate life,

27:25.635 --> 27:28.128
a life so well lived that
it needs to be written about.

27:28.928 --> 27:30.096
I really like him.

27:30.146 --> 27:31.176
I really like you.

27:38.353 --> 27:39.734
Anything else, mr. Hesburgh?

27:42.219 --> 27:43.961
Uh, no. Thanks.

27:46.788 --> 27:47.827
Wait a minute.

27:49.894 --> 27:54.492
- You're T. Hesburgh?
- Yes...I am.

27:56.334 --> 27:57.241
I'm sorry.

27:57.867 --> 28:00.671
Oh, my god. Oh, my fucking god.

28:01.382 --> 28:02.657
Hey, wait a second.

28:03.988 --> 28:04.818
George.

28:05.769 --> 28:06.686
Hey, George, wait.

28:08.031 --> 28:09.921
Look, I should have told
you my name was Hesburgh,

28:09.968 --> 28:10.972
but I was just having some fun.

28:11.028 --> 28:13.301
- Just stay away from me, just
stay-- - No, wait. Wait a second.

28:13.727 --> 28:14.981
I wasn't messing with you.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.044
I mean, I guess I was at first, but...

28:18.022 --> 28:19.370
I really do like you.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.637
I really like you too.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.931
Just do the job, George.

28:24.623 --> 28:26.428
As I live and breathe,

28:26.737 --> 28:28.421
Thomas Hesburgh III.

28:30.628 --> 28:32.976
- What?
- Hey, dad.

28:34.119 --> 28:36.960
- Who are you?
- I'm Thomas Hesburgh III.

28:37.088 --> 28:38.487
I'm the third... Trip.

28:39.152 --> 28:41.851
I know, but that's the hand I
was dealt. Thanks a lot, dad.

28:42.096 --> 28:45.435
- Hi, and I'm Thomas Hesburgh.
- Hi.

28:46.801 --> 28:51.424
- So you're three. Then you're...
- Junior.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.639
You can put all the blame on me.

28:54.745 --> 28:56.591
My father was Thomas
Hesburgh, I'm Thomas Hesburgh,

28:56.693 --> 28:57.944
Trip is Thomas Hesburgh,

28:58.045 --> 29:00.144
and when he gets around to siring a son,

29:00.815 --> 29:02.350
the kid will be saddled with...

29:02.498 --> 29:03.906
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater.

29:04.931 --> 29:05.741
Good for you.

29:06.087 --> 29:09.575
Oh, dad, this is my friend,
George. George, this is my dad.

29:11.039 --> 29:11.889
A pleasure.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.933
Is everything all right, young lady?

29:20.336 --> 29:23.874
Just too much, um, champagne.

29:32.615 --> 29:33.515
Son of a...

29:38.694 --> 29:39.618
Look at this.

29:42.272 --> 29:43.315
Helene!

29:43.568 --> 29:44.471
Watch out.

29:45.578 --> 29:46.448
Helene!

29:47.256 --> 29:47.963
Helene,
watch--

29:51.845 --> 29:52.526
Dad?

29:54.207 --> 29:54.813
Dad?

29:56.743 --> 29:57.313
Dad?

29:58.172 --> 29:59.841
Oh, my god, dad. Say something.

30:00.209 --> 30:01.531
Say something, dad, please.

30:01.710 --> 30:02.637
Please, don't do this.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.415
And just like that, Trip escaped.

30:05.449 --> 30:07.418
I wonder if he would've
seen it that way.

30:07.497 --> 30:08.120
Dad?

30:08.804 --> 30:12.379
On behalf of TNA, I do
apologize for our delay.

30:12.431 --> 30:15.514
We're experiencing some flow
control because of the weather.

30:15.576 --> 30:19.537
In the meantime, please enjoy a
refreshing cocktail. I know I am...

30:19.838 --> 30:22.559
I'm kidding. No, I'm not.

30:22.610 --> 30:24.980
We are going to Cancun today, Roxy.

30:26.311 --> 30:27.535
Hell, yeah.

30:28.498 --> 30:32.026
We are going to drink
margaritas on the beach.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.166
Hello.

30:55.371 --> 30:56.232
It's on.

30:57.675 --> 30:59.074
I could use some more bubbly.

31:15.439 --> 31:17.080
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:17.579 --> 31:19.230
How was school today?

31:20.746 --> 31:22.327
A dragon was killed...

31:23.746 --> 31:24.597
Wow.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.797
And I think our janitor was hurt.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.035
How?

31:29.798 --> 31:31.175
Trying to catch the dragon.

31:32.912 --> 31:33.867
Okay.

31:35.568 --> 31:38.373
- And I talked to this boy.
- Well, that's nice.

31:38.984 --> 31:39.905
Was he cute?

31:40.928 --> 31:42.859
I think he knows George.

31:44.918 --> 31:46.110
So...

31:47.190 --> 31:48.987
it was a busy day.

31:52.267 --> 31:54.736
I can't wait for some real mexican food.

31:55.367 --> 31:58.828
- Do you like mole sauce? -
"Mol-ay," and it's my favorite.

31:58.890 --> 32:00.424
You know it's real chocolate sauce?

32:00.607 --> 32:01.879
- Fuck off.
- Mm-hmm.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.220
Help!

32:06.647 --> 32:08.182
I wanted to go snorkeling.

32:10.040 --> 32:10.986
It's so beautiful down there.

32:11.083 --> 32:13.476
All the different fish,
it's like another world.

32:14.126 --> 32:14.919
Help!

32:15.032 --> 32:17.387
Fucking peanuts. I can't...breathe.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.117
I wanted to try parasailing, too.

32:20.096 --> 32:22.159
A hundred feet in the air
with your balls in a sling

32:22.200 --> 32:25.128
behind a motorboat driven
by two drunks named Pedro?

32:25.185 --> 32:26.132
I don't think so.

32:30.739 --> 32:33.265
- Can you see?
- I can't see.

32:33.365 --> 32:34.805
Is he all right?

32:41.010 --> 32:41.552
Bernie.

32:42.009 --> 32:42.669
Baby?

32:45.132 --> 32:46.718
You bitch.

33:03.371 --> 33:05.643
Maybe the tickets are refundable.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.730
Act of god, all that bull, you know?

33:08.160 --> 33:10.859
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

33:11.709 --> 33:14.458
It should just be a
couple more minutes, folks.

33:14.587 --> 33:15.876
Thanks for your patience.

33:18.668 --> 33:20.014
- Come on, dad.
- Look at him.

33:20.113 --> 33:20.771
Don't do this.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.594
He learned lifesaving
at junior lifeguards.

33:22.958 --> 33:24.232
He really loves you.

33:24.834 --> 33:26.100
He likes you.

33:27.334 --> 33:28.712
I've seen the way he looks at you.

33:28.902 --> 33:30.115
Something going on there.

33:30.196 --> 33:30.825
I don't...

33:31.215 --> 33:33.986
it was just flirting. I
shouldn't have been doing it.

33:35.910 --> 33:37.630
Say goodbye to my son, why don't you?

33:38.463 --> 33:40.570
Um, he's...

33:41.158 --> 33:43.329
busy with you.

33:43.559 --> 33:44.702
Don't be afraid.

33:45.423 --> 33:46.350
Well, say something.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.034
Tell him you're sorry.

33:49.765 --> 33:50.792
God...

33:51.792 --> 33:52.648
Okay.

33:53.001 --> 33:55.173
I like him. Do I say, "I'll call you"?

33:55.310 --> 33:57.148
Or do I just give him my number?

33:57.374 --> 34:00.347
That's what Daisy would do.
She'd say, "here's my card."

34:00.972 --> 34:02.689
Fuck, his dad just died.

34:03.231 --> 34:03.773
I...

34:04.550 --> 34:05.421
I...

34:06.899 --> 34:08.469
I'm just sorry.

34:16.007 --> 34:17.208
I'll look out for him.

34:17.452 --> 34:18.659
Come on, please.

34:18.737 --> 34:20.172
You look out for him, too, huh?

34:20.842 --> 34:21.601
Okay.

34:21.713 --> 34:22.353
Promise?

34:23.070 --> 34:23.956
I promise.

34:30.208 --> 34:30.996
Hi.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.744
- Did you get Reggie?
- Yes.

34:34.467 --> 34:38.436
Come on, leave that for later.
I'll buy you an ice cream.

34:38.875 --> 34:41.645
You used to love rainbow sherbet, right?

34:43.242 --> 34:45.931
We need to chat about Reggie.

34:46.123 --> 34:48.366
Her issues are really buried.

34:48.429 --> 34:49.918
I'm dealing with her issues, mom.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.252
I stopped using top and bottom sheets.

34:53.543 --> 34:55.790
I just take a big navajo blanket,

34:55.893 --> 34:57.564
toss it over the futon,

34:57.699 --> 34:59.220
boom, bed's made.

34:59.304 --> 35:01.863
Well, that's great. The next
time I go camping with tonto,

35:01.919 --> 35:03.240
I'll be sure to give that a shot.

35:03.297 --> 35:06.896
I don't think conventional
therapy is the way to go, Joy.

35:07.249 --> 35:10.767
My word, you're making
this bed so tight.

35:10.845 --> 35:12.599
You know, mom, it's my bed,

35:12.815 --> 35:14.996
and I'm making it the way that I like,

35:15.190 --> 35:17.130
because I'm going to lie in it.

35:17.443 --> 35:20.479
- Truer wordswere never spoken.
- No, you know what's true?

35:20.663 --> 35:23.095
You would rather stand here

35:23.316 --> 35:26.029
and criticize how I make my bed

35:26.157 --> 35:28.163
than actually help me make it.

35:28.245 --> 35:31.570
Your idea of help is
trying to keep order.

35:31.647 --> 35:33.888
Sometimes order is not possible, Joy.

35:34.030 --> 35:40.278
It is not always possible to
make sure that everything...

35:40.344 --> 35:42.822
is in the proper place.

35:44.471 --> 35:46.826
Okay, "hey, should I call
my husband and daughter

35:46.877 --> 35:48.352
and tell them where I am?

35:48.439 --> 35:52.381
"No, I think I'll just send them
some smoke signals from my teepee"!

35:52.688 --> 35:56.290
- That's not fair.
- You are so fucking selfish.

35:56.417 --> 35:59.508
"Hey, time. Who needs time, right?

35:59.539 --> 36:02.861
I'm a free spirit. I
am way beyond time."

36:03.235 --> 36:07.107
"Let's keep everything neat and tidy.

36:07.203 --> 36:10.911
"Let's make sure that everything
is in its proper place,

36:10.992 --> 36:14.278
"that everything is
exactly where I left it,

36:14.356 --> 36:16.977
"that nothing will ever change.

36:17.049 --> 36:19.855
"My marriage can end,
my daughter can die,

36:19.922 --> 36:22.772
but thank god the house is neat."

36:22.850 --> 36:25.439
- Go to hell!
- Goddammit, Joy!

36:25.992 --> 36:28.390
Sometimes life is messy!

36:29.889 --> 36:31.622
Get used to it!

36:39.151 --> 36:40.676
Hi, sweetie. How was school?

36:41.477 --> 36:42.188
Good.

36:45.960 --> 36:49.062
So...who's up for ice cream?

36:56.053 --> 36:59.942
Did you know that due to
the Komodo dragon's speed,

36:59.982 --> 37:04.204
it is nearly impossible to
escape if it's chasing you?

37:04.465 --> 37:06.536
Thinking about getting a pet?

37:06.659 --> 37:08.125
Just learning something new.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.779
Kiffany, are there any of those
fresh oatmeal cookies left?

37:11.847 --> 37:12.563
I think so.

37:12.635 --> 37:14.403
Will you bring one for my friend here?

37:14.622 --> 37:16.081
Will you warm it up, please?

37:16.168 --> 37:17.212
- All right.
- Thank you.

37:18.077 --> 37:19.963
I feel something bad coming.

37:20.273 --> 37:21.718
What makes you say that?

37:21.784 --> 37:25.875
Any time you order me food, you
always follow it up with bad news.

37:26.083 --> 37:27.468
How was the Montgomery club?

37:27.672 --> 37:28.338
Fine.

37:28.798 --> 37:30.182
Tell me the bad news.

37:30.235 --> 37:31.706
There's no bad news, George.

37:32.170 --> 37:34.383
I just want to leave my girl...

37:35.050 --> 37:37.102
with a smile on her face.

37:41.606 --> 37:43.625
- What's up with him?
- I'm not sure.

37:44.450 --> 37:47.719
We were at a school today. He
acts really strange around kids.

37:47.829 --> 37:49.477
Hmm. Stranger.

37:50.174 --> 37:51.592
How was the Montgomery club?

37:51.781 --> 37:55.207
Stuffy, entitled, bullshit.

37:55.917 --> 37:57.649
I really liked it.

37:57.992 --> 37:59.467
I'm so proud of you.

37:59.815 --> 38:01.396
I think I'm going to go back.

38:01.715 --> 38:03.315
Mm-hmm, what's his name?

38:03.388 --> 38:05.114
- Trip.
- Trip?

38:05.375 --> 38:07.526
- Here you go, sweetheart.
- Thank you, kiffany.

38:09.650 --> 38:10.916
Trip...

38:11.353 --> 38:15.099
I kissed him, and then I reaped his dad.

38:15.390 --> 38:16.674
Complicated.

38:17.714 --> 38:18.467
Good kisser?

38:18.763 --> 38:21.517
Hmm, smart, funny...

38:21.861 --> 38:24.094
- Money?
- Please.

38:25.616 --> 38:28.921
Up until his dad died, I thought he
was going to be my first boyfriend.

38:29.054 --> 38:29.934
Mm-hmm, and now?

38:31.339 --> 38:32.879
He's my first boyfriend.

38:33.058 --> 38:37.114
Well...it's a little risky, Georgia.

38:38.675 --> 38:40.350
What have I got to lose?

38:42.095 --> 38:43.012
Everything.

38:46.457 --> 38:48.260
I bet everything.

38:48.638 --> 38:52.458
Oh, well, then you say, "all in."

38:53.233 --> 38:54.886
- All in.
- Right.

38:55.136 --> 38:57.910
All right, too rich
for my blood. I fold.

38:58.053 --> 38:58.755
Let's see.

39:01.095 --> 39:03.566
Oh... oh, wow.

39:03.998 --> 39:05.351
You win, you win.

39:05.518 --> 39:08.134
Here, here. Yay!

39:08.853 --> 39:09.478
Um...

39:10.652 --> 39:12.752
I think it's your bedtime, Reggie.

39:14.583 --> 39:17.387
If you want to stay up a little while
longer, honey, it's okay with me.

39:21.773 --> 39:25.347
That's okay. I'm
tired. I had a long day.

39:25.613 --> 39:26.407
See you in the morning.

39:27.078 --> 39:27.744
'Night.

39:29.104 --> 39:30.329
Good night, honey.

39:35.069 --> 39:36.978
- Joy, honey?
- Hmm?

39:38.086 --> 39:39.950
I think I'll go home tomorrow.

39:40.038 --> 39:41.479
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

39:42.157 --> 39:45.335
We never do seem to find
a resting place, do we?

39:47.156 --> 39:48.033
No.

39:50.010 --> 39:51.843
I don't mean to be hurtful, mom.

39:53.067 --> 39:54.316
Neither do I.

39:54.920 --> 39:55.832
I know.

39:56.697 --> 39:58.887
I could always come back.

40:00.053 --> 40:00.818
Hmm...

40:04.146 --> 40:05.031
Say it.

40:05.821 --> 40:07.335
You can always come back.

40:07.837 --> 40:09.026
Thank you.

40:14.641 --> 40:16.192
I worry...

40:17.132 --> 40:19.589
about your daughter.

40:20.720 --> 40:21.558
I know.

40:23.074 --> 40:24.382
Both of them.

40:26.758 --> 40:27.887
I know.

40:33.724 --> 40:36.965
I think that everyone wants
to escape wherever they are.

40:39.259 --> 40:40.579
We nearly made it.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.198
To our near escape.

40:43.915 --> 40:44.695
Clink.

40:52.764 --> 40:56.891
I think it was meant to be a
narrow escape, actually, Roxy.

40:57.930 --> 40:59.246
To that too.

40:59.702 --> 41:00.592
Clink.

41:00.696 --> 41:02.154
Clink, yeah.

41:07.263 --> 41:10.878
- Have you ever been to Mexico?
- No.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.458
I've never been anywhere.

41:17.052 --> 41:19.305
I think it would have been nice.

41:20.054 --> 41:20.878
Me too.

41:22.465 --> 41:24.195
I think we would have had fun.

41:24.901 --> 41:26.181
Me too.

41:26.801 --> 41:29.059
People don't seem really
happy where they are.

41:29.842 --> 41:31.993
They're always looking
for a different place,

41:32.122 --> 41:32.992
a different person,

41:33.543 --> 41:34.635
just different.

41:35.275 --> 41:36.703
Like my mom used to say,

41:37.118 --> 41:38.832
"the grass is always greener..."

41:39.527 --> 41:42.397
everyone's searching for the other side.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.877
I'm already there,
and I'm still looking.

41:46.989 --> 41:50.292
We're sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

41:50.354 --> 41:53.034
Please check the number
and dial again, or call...

41:55.278 --> 41:56.594
No one will admit it,

41:56.809 --> 41:59.420
but people desperately
want to be in clubs,

41:59.836 --> 42:02.365
especially the ones they can't join,

42:03.552 --> 42:05.088
and I don't know what to do

42:05.231 --> 42:07.762
now that I've found the
one I want to belong to...

42:18.435 --> 42:21.871
So I went back to the only one
that would have me for a member.

42:22.057 --> 42:23.806
Are you still waiting
for your friends, hon?

42:24.758 --> 42:25.633
Yeah.

42:26.409 --> 42:27.375
I'll come back.

42:28.994 --> 42:31.758
And just because I
had no one to talk to,

42:32.565 --> 42:34.379
didn't mean I couldn't listen.

42:37.910 --> 42:38.838
I'll get it.

42:44.275 --> 42:47.015
Hello? Lass residence.

42:48.028 --> 42:51.659
You mother tells me you're not
going back to college next semester.

42:53.799 --> 42:54.602
Yeah.

42:55.718 --> 42:57.961
Congratulations.

43:04.010 --> 43:06.297
- A frog?
- Mm-hmm.

43:06.986 --> 43:09.966
A little "you're on your own" present.

43:11.174 --> 43:12.270
For luck?

43:13.603 --> 43:16.127
Frogs symbolize new life,

43:16.679 --> 43:18.046
transformation,

43:18.708 --> 43:21.563
from tadpole to young woman...

43:21.723 --> 43:23.853
That's you, sweetheart.

43:25.666 --> 43:27.907
Whatever you say, grandma.

43:32.325 --> 43:34.727
You have great life in you, Georgia.

43:36.636 --> 43:38.208
Don't let that escape you.

43:40.516 --> 43:41.474
Promise?

43:43.662 --> 43:44.736
I promise.

43:49.919 --> 43:52.022
It's a filthy habit.

43:52.969 --> 43:56.354
One drag, and don't tell your mother.

43:57.700 --> 43:59.308
I promise.

44:06.629 --> 44:07.562
Hello?

44:09.261 --> 44:11.134
- Hello?
- Can I help you?

44:11.365 --> 44:13.209
Hi. This is...

44:15.896 --> 44:18.656
Is this the lady of the house?

44:18.733 --> 44:22.869
No, the lady of the house is doing
something extremely important.

44:22.957 --> 44:25.645
I think it involves a dust buster.

44:27.349 --> 44:28.199
Who is this?

44:31.727 --> 44:32.793
Who is this?

44:34.026 --> 44:35.726
I have the wrong number.

44:48.433 --> 44:49.832
As a little girl,

44:50.542 --> 44:53.456
I used to think my
grandma was a little loony.

44:54.668 --> 44:57.572
Now I get that she
was just really alive.

44:58.611 --> 45:01.795
If I only knew then what I know now...

45:04.130 --> 45:05.692
Join the club.
