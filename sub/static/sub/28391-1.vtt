00:18.593 --> 00:21.676
(suspenseful music)

00:47.577 --> 00:50.327
(peaceful music)

00:59.910 --> 01:03.680
- Our God most definitely
answers our prayers,

01:03.680 --> 01:08.270
listens to our prayers and moves
in response to our prayers.

01:08.270 --> 01:10.717
Be thankful for what
God has blessed you with

01:11.662 --> 01:13.793
and for what God will bless you with.

01:14.721 --> 01:15.843
- (whistles) Wishes.

01:18.964 --> 01:19.797
Hello.

01:22.695 --> 01:25.445
(peaceful music)

01:28.000 --> 01:29.790
- Before your sister passed away

01:29.790 --> 01:33.220
you said you prayed night and day.

01:33.220 --> 01:36.110
- I have faith that you
will intervene tomorrow

01:36.110 --> 01:38.220
and I will finally get the success

01:38.220 --> 01:39.920
that I've been praying for.

01:39.920 --> 01:42.260
- Keep writing, maybe you can get

01:42.260 --> 01:43.670
a smaller publishing company

01:43.670 --> 01:45.370
to put out one of your future books.

01:45.370 --> 01:48.130
- You know, what did I do
that was so bad in this life

01:48.130 --> 01:52.293
that you can't answer one,
just one of my prayers?

01:54.087 --> 01:57.087
(suspenseful music)

02:09.610 --> 02:11.605
It's like I can't remember people's names.

02:11.605 --> 02:15.769
You're uh, you're.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.786
- [Brian] It starts with a B.
- Beltron.

02:17.786 --> 02:18.619
Ben.

02:18.619 --> 02:19.452
Benson?

02:19.452 --> 02:20.285
- [Brian] Brian.

02:20.285 --> 02:21.118
- Brian.

02:21.118 --> 02:24.980
And you're the butler.

02:24.980 --> 02:29.430
- Only if I've been
demoted from being your PA.

02:29.430 --> 02:30.819
- Oh sorry sugar pops

02:30.819 --> 02:33.820
but I'm not gonna be able
to make dinner tonight.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.047
- You're Darren Bennett.

02:35.047 --> 02:36.560
We got married?

02:36.560 --> 02:37.780
- And you are?

02:37.780 --> 02:39.470
- I'm Betsy.

02:39.470 --> 02:40.350
Betsy Simon.

02:40.350 --> 02:41.820
- Betsy Simon.

02:41.820 --> 02:42.700
Yeah, no.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.200
- I'm married, I live in a mansion

02:45.200 --> 02:47.440
and all of this because
apparently the books I've written

02:47.440 --> 02:49.576
have done really well
and have made me wealthy.

02:49.576 --> 02:51.885
- If what you say is true,

02:51.885 --> 02:53.670
then it would appear that God
has answered your prayers.

02:53.670 --> 02:54.600
- All of them?

02:54.600 --> 02:58.340
If he answered them all,
then it all makes sense.

02:58.340 --> 02:59.723
He's gotta put things back.

03:01.904 --> 03:04.000
(door knocking)

03:04.000 --> 03:04.853
Not now.

03:06.710 --> 03:09.460
- [Brian] Sorry to bother
you, but your sister is here.

03:11.648 --> 03:14.565
(melancholy music)

03:16.040 --> 03:19.230
- So if you ask God to put
things back and he does

03:19.230 --> 03:21.080
then you lose Sally again.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.820
- So you finally believe me?

03:22.820 --> 03:24.220
- No.

03:24.220 --> 03:26.400
- You used to work for us.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.983
For Wishes Incorporated,

03:27.983 --> 03:31.240
until the end of last
year and then you quit.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.200
- We caught her, we're taking
her to court and that's it.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.812
- You think Sally took the money?

03:37.812 --> 03:39.590
- Here we go again, you know this.

03:39.590 --> 03:40.760
She's a criminal.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.134
- You're so busy being a celebrity,

03:43.134 --> 03:46.220
you can't even see what it
did to you or your family.

03:46.220 --> 03:47.650
- Whatever the reason,

03:47.650 --> 03:50.240
that is no justification for what you did.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.833
So where do I go from here?

03:53.520 --> 03:58.230
- Let God do what He does and
trust that He knows wisdom.

03:58.230 --> 04:02.623
- Not my will, but your will be done.

04:03.890 --> 04:04.870
(peaceful music)

04:04.870 --> 04:07.780
- [Betsy Voiceover] Again
God answered my prayer

04:07.780 --> 04:10.820
and I returned to the life
I was supposed to live.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.920
I probably won't tell
anyone what happened,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.535
not that they'd believe me.

04:15.535 --> 04:17.760
Except for maybe Pastor John.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.680
Like Ann Westphal suggested
I will continue to write.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.120
My next book will be fiction
to those who read it,

04:25.120 --> 04:27.353
but to me, it really happened.

04:28.818 --> 04:31.568
(peaceful music)

05:02.772 --> 05:05.653
- Want some, here you go.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.010
Now there you go.

05:07.010 --> 05:08.423
Time to celebrate Wishes.

05:21.287 --> 05:22.767
(cat meows)

05:22.767 --> 05:25.432
No, this one's not about you.

05:25.432 --> 05:27.765
(cat meows)

05:29.860 --> 05:33.150
Heavenly Father, thank you for guiding me

05:33.150 --> 05:34.700
through the pages of this book.

05:35.980 --> 05:37.280
I hope readers will like it

05:37.280 --> 05:39.713
and maybe benefit from it as I did.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.700
If it ever gets published that is.

05:48.000 --> 05:48.833
Sorry.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.053
(peaceful hymnal music)

06:22.610 --> 06:24.690
Pastor John.
- Betsy.

06:24.690 --> 06:26.819
Oh boy, chocolate chip?

06:26.819 --> 06:28.477
- White chocolate chip.

06:28.477 --> 06:29.970
- Oh, did you make them?

06:29.970 --> 06:31.230
- I did.

06:31.230 --> 06:32.820
- Okay well, I'm probably
gonna sneak off with

06:32.820 --> 06:33.870
whatever's left over.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.780
- You should, I made 'em just for you.

06:35.780 --> 06:36.930
- Pastor John.
- Yeah.

06:37.953 --> 06:41.270
- I have the flyers for the fundraiser

06:41.270 --> 06:43.220
what do you think?
- Oh Jerry, that looks great.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.600
I really appreciate it.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.930
- Okay, I'll take 'em
and give 'em to your wife

06:46.930 --> 06:48.129
and have her run 'em off okay.

06:48.129 --> 06:49.953
- Great, thank you.
- Okay, alright.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.635
- How's that fundraising coming along?

06:53.635 --> 06:56.270
- Well not as good as we were hoping for.

06:56.270 --> 06:58.650
Yeah, repairing steeples
over 100 years old,

06:58.650 --> 07:01.453
not to mention the roof,
it just isn't cheap.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.010
- Well, if we don't raise
the funds where will we go?

07:05.010 --> 07:06.880
- The Elders are looking
into moving services.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.960
Maybe, perhaps the community center.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.920
But you know, we are gonna stay positive,

07:11.920 --> 07:14.760
continue our prayers and
God will know what to do.

07:14.760 --> 07:19.360
- Speaking of prayer, it's done.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.390
- What?

07:20.390 --> 07:22.390
- Heavens to Betsy, I
finished it yesterday.

07:22.390 --> 07:25.420
- Congratulations, oh my
goodness, how long did it take?

07:25.420 --> 07:26.880
- Six months, give or take.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.490
- Is that how long the other ones took?

07:28.490 --> 07:31.787
- This one came to me a little
easier than the last ones.

07:31.787 --> 07:34.392
- But there's no Wishes this time?

07:34.392 --> 07:37.366
- Well technically she's in it,

07:37.366 --> 07:41.510
but no, this one isn't about her.

07:41.510 --> 07:45.470
- Hmm, I wonder who the
main character is then?

07:45.470 --> 07:48.202
- Obviously from the
title she's got my name.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.900
- (laughs) Yes.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.830
Okay, so what's next?

07:51.830 --> 07:53.710
- Um, I copyright it,

07:53.710 --> 07:56.520
send it to potential publishers, agents.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.820
- What about the woman
you were working with.

07:58.820 --> 08:00.310
You said she had some sort of connection

08:00.310 --> 08:01.220
to the publishing business?

08:01.220 --> 08:02.330
- Oh, things didn't work out with her.

08:02.330 --> 08:04.410
- That's too bad.

08:04.410 --> 08:05.243
Well good luck.

08:05.243 --> 08:07.070
And I can't wait any longer,

08:07.070 --> 08:08.791
we've gotta dig into those cookies.

08:08.791 --> 08:09.624
- Yeah, let's help you.

08:09.624 --> 08:11.357
- Let's see what you did.

08:12.758 --> 08:15.508
(peaceful music)

08:21.827 --> 08:24.827
(suspenseful music)

08:29.637 --> 08:32.070
- Betsy, you look amazing!

08:32.070 --> 08:35.023
- Veronica, thanks.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.063
- I'm moving to LA.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.400
- Wow.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.429
Did something happen?

08:42.429 --> 08:43.933
Are you gonna be on a TV show?

08:44.900 --> 08:47.160
- No, it's just time to go.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.300
There's nothing here in Chicago

08:48.300 --> 08:50.690
for up and coming actors my age.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.240
- Bit of a contradiction there.

08:53.765 --> 08:55.030
- What do you mean?

08:55.030 --> 08:57.870
- Well, isn't up and
coming usually used a term

08:57.870 --> 08:59.010
used for younger...

09:01.920 --> 09:03.220
Never mind.

09:03.220 --> 09:06.880
Uh, what about all the shows
that they shoot here though?

09:06.880 --> 09:11.173
I mean there's Chicago Fire,
Chicago PD, Chicago Plumbers.

09:11.173 --> 09:13.020
- Impossible.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.430
Too many actors and not enough shows.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.040
- Aren't there more actors out in LA

09:17.040 --> 09:18.980
and wouldn't the
competition be even greater?

09:18.980 --> 09:20.283
- Not if you stand out.

09:21.460 --> 09:24.843
- You stand out, do you?

09:24.843 --> 09:26.270
- What do you mean?

09:26.270 --> 09:27.840
- Never mind.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.210
- Do you need any furniture?

09:29.210 --> 09:30.640
I'm selling everything.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.310
- Uh, no, I don't.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.613
I don't have enough room as it is.

09:34.613 --> 09:36.543
You're not bringing anything with you?

09:36.543 --> 09:38.797
- I can't, I'm moving into a commune.

09:39.883 --> 09:40.970
- A commune?

09:40.970 --> 09:44.163
- Yeah, with other people who
can't afford a place to live.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.659
A lot of actors do that.

09:47.659 --> 09:49.416
It's like a homeless shelter

09:49.416 --> 09:52.139
but with better restroom facilities

09:52.139 --> 09:54.373
and there's a Starbucks nearby.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.550
- Wow, that sounds awful.

09:59.550 --> 10:00.730
- What do you mean?

10:00.730 --> 10:02.180
- Never mind.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.800
- Here's my card, with my cell number.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.810
If you know of anyone
looking to buy furniture,

10:07.810 --> 10:10.760
or kitchen stuff, or
things that people need,

10:10.760 --> 10:12.400
you know, to live.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.430
- Ronnie Love, professional
actress, model, singer,

10:16.430 --> 10:19.600
dancer, comedian, voiceover
artist, stunt double,

10:19.600 --> 10:23.060
body double, movie extra, poet.

10:23.060 --> 10:28.060
- Dark is the night, I can't see.

10:28.640 --> 10:33.640
Death is holding his hands over my eyes.

10:33.890 --> 10:37.760
Dark is the night, on one knee.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.850
Death is stepping on my life.

10:40.850 --> 10:45.850
I can't breathe, take it away, far away.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.442
(cheerful music)

10:56.470 --> 10:57.303
- Wow.

10:57.303 --> 10:58.548
- I know right.

10:58.548 --> 11:01.350
Too much talent and not enough
room on that stupid card.

11:01.350 --> 11:03.410
- No, yeah where would you put it?

11:03.410 --> 11:06.230
Say, whatever happened
to that film audition

11:06.230 --> 11:07.490
you had a while back?

11:07.490 --> 11:08.791
- Which one?

11:08.791 --> 11:11.170
- [Betsy] The one with
the killer zombie trees?

11:11.170 --> 11:14.000
- Oh, yeah.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
Amazing concept, amazing
script and an amazing director.

11:20.298 --> 11:23.273
Couldn't raise the
money, it never got made.

11:24.530 --> 11:26.140
- Darren Bennett.

11:26.140 --> 11:27.833
- Right, you've heard of him.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.133
- Nope.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.160
- Got another audition
in a couple of hours.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.760
- Another film audition?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.864
- Dog food.

11:34.864 --> 11:36.170
- Excuse me?

11:36.170 --> 11:37.540
- Commercial.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.970
It's for the role of a dog owner

11:39.970 --> 11:43.390
that believes her dog is
going to be a movie star,

11:43.390 --> 11:44.910
even though it's a mutt.

11:44.910 --> 11:45.750
(dog barks)

11:45.750 --> 11:47.390
- You'll nail it.

11:47.390 --> 11:48.223
- Thanks.

11:49.766 --> 11:51.030
- Break a leg.

11:51.030 --> 11:51.863
- You bet.

11:54.259 --> 11:57.443
(upbeat music)

11:57.443 --> 11:59.693
(crashing)

12:01.073 --> 12:02.320
My leg!

12:02.320 --> 12:03.773
Oh my goodness.

12:06.569 --> 12:08.138
I can't move it.

12:08.138 --> 12:10.888
(peaceful music)

12:32.636 --> 12:33.990
(TV audience applauding)

12:33.990 --> 12:35.517
- They're here Mr. Dackery.

12:35.517 --> 12:38.740
And they have been here for
at least the past six decades.

12:38.740 --> 12:41.290
- Why can't we see them Mr. Carter?

12:41.290 --> 12:43.200
- Well, they have
infiltrated our world leaders

12:43.200 --> 12:46.470
and are slowly taking
over other countries.

12:46.470 --> 12:47.460
- The United States?

12:47.460 --> 12:49.610
- Especially the United States.

12:49.610 --> 12:52.650
I mean, how else would you
explain all the chaos and mayhem?

12:52.650 --> 12:54.600
Dividing our country right now?

12:54.600 --> 12:59.100
They control us Mr. Dackery
and they are everywhere.

12:59.100 --> 13:02.499
They do subliminal messages
in our newspapers, magazines,

13:02.499 --> 13:05.830
TV commercials, billboards,
internet websites.

13:05.830 --> 13:08.113
- Who is doing this Mr. Carter?

13:09.660 --> 13:10.543
- Aliens.

13:11.510 --> 13:13.078
- Illegal aliens.

13:13.078 --> 13:14.650
- No.

13:14.650 --> 13:18.000
No, no, aliens from another universe.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.700
Extra terrestrials.

13:19.700 --> 13:24.700
- Those little guys who like
to phone home, no doubt.

13:27.930 --> 13:29.420
And I suppose they look like us

13:29.420 --> 13:32.110
which makes it hard for us to see them.

13:32.110 --> 13:33.810
- Not unless you're wearing these.

13:36.447 --> 13:39.447
(suspenseful music)

13:41.065 --> 13:43.065
(gasps)

13:52.903 --> 13:55.903
(suspenseful music)

13:59.430 --> 14:00.330
What'd I tell you?

14:02.281 --> 14:05.340
(suspenseful music)

14:05.340 --> 14:07.363
- You're an idiot Mr. Carter.

14:09.524 --> 14:14.210
Alright somebody contact the
producers of Finding Bigfoot

14:14.210 --> 14:15.980
and tell 'em we've got another nut ball

14:15.980 --> 14:17.900
that's looking for his own reality show.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.410
- I have a PHD in

14:19.410 --> 14:22.620
Neuro Extra Terrestrial
Science from Cambridge.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.080
And you told me you believed me,

14:24.080 --> 14:26.190
and you wanted to enlighten the world

14:26.190 --> 14:28.490
and bring this important
matter to the light.

14:28.490 --> 14:29.870
And now you.

14:29.870 --> 14:30.833
Oh you're rude.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.340
- No doubt.

14:35.340 --> 14:36.485
(TV audience applauding)

14:36.485 --> 14:37.400
(laughs)

14:37.400 --> 14:38.240
- Hi Betsy.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.870
- Mrs. Poscotti.

14:39.870 --> 14:42.290
- I really like the look of this place.

14:42.290 --> 14:45.959
- Oh thanks, we just finished
remodeling last week.

14:45.959 --> 14:47.480
(laughs)

14:47.480 --> 14:49.800
You don't have an appointment.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.303
- But I have a concern.

14:52.689 --> 14:53.890
- Concern?

14:53.890 --> 14:55.070
- You remember that tooth

14:55.070 --> 14:56.810
that the dentist couldn't put back in?

14:56.810 --> 14:57.880
- Yeah.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.893
- I've given it more than enough time

14:59.893 --> 15:02.920
but I just can't go on eating without it.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.730
It's caused a lot of lopsided chewing,

15:05.730 --> 15:06.860
as I knew it would.

15:06.860 --> 15:10.320
So, I need him to pull
the one on the other side.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.830
You know, for balance.

15:11.830 --> 15:12.683
- Balance.

15:13.552 --> 15:14.520
Um (laughs).

15:14.520 --> 15:17.775
I'm assuming there's nothing
wrong with the other tooth?

15:17.775 --> 15:18.923
- No, no.

15:22.550 --> 15:24.696
- Mrs. Poscotti.

15:24.696 --> 15:29.696
I am sure that the dentist
will not pull a healthy tooth.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.410
It would have to be infected or cracked.

15:34.410 --> 15:35.373
- Oh, okay.

15:37.190 --> 15:39.940
(cheerful music)

15:41.210 --> 15:42.373
I'll see what I can do.

15:47.370 --> 15:48.803
- Mrs. Poscotti wait.

15:53.263 --> 15:55.930
(phone ringing)

16:06.130 --> 16:06.963
Hello.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.340
- How have you been?

16:19.340 --> 16:20.223
- I've been good.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.230
- Heavens to Betsy.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.273
I'd like to read it.

16:26.710 --> 16:29.593
An associate of mine, Stacey
Blair told me about it.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.380
- I'm sorry Miss Westphal,

16:41.380 --> 16:43.283
haven't we been here before?

16:45.400 --> 16:48.020
- It's obvious there are
still some bad feelings

16:48.020 --> 16:49.170
about what happened.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.930
Otherwise you would have sent
me a copy of the manuscript

16:51.930 --> 16:54.440
instead of me finding out
about it from other agents

16:54.440 --> 16:55.540
through the grapevine.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.773
And I understand.

16:59.530 --> 17:02.250
And there's probably no way I can convince you

17:02.250 --> 17:03.400
I did nothing wrong.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.619
So, I'm not even going to try.

17:05.619 --> 17:09.275
Instead, let me make it up to you.

17:09.275 --> 17:10.829
Give me a chance to read the book

17:10.829 --> 17:13.140
and if it's as good as Stacey says it is,

17:13.140 --> 17:14.390
we'll take it from there.

17:16.130 --> 17:18.193
What have you got to lose?

17:19.281 --> 17:22.199
(melancholy music)

17:25.905 --> 17:26.738
- Well.

17:29.170 --> 17:30.003
Should I?

17:31.469 --> 17:33.802
(cat meows)

17:34.840 --> 17:35.673
Okay.

17:37.587 --> 17:39.137
You better be right about this.

17:43.441 --> 17:45.441
(sighs)

17:48.103 --> 17:51.103
(suspenseful music)

18:04.220 --> 18:05.743
- I'm very impressed.

18:07.730 --> 18:08.660
- Thanks.

18:08.660 --> 18:10.400
- I like the story,

18:10.400 --> 18:13.410
the whole idea of God answering
the main character's prayers

18:13.410 --> 18:15.203
all at once is very clever.

18:16.746 --> 18:17.960
- Thanks.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.910
- The story has been done before of course.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.820
It's A Wonderful Life and such,

18:21.820 --> 18:25.640
but it's so sweet, so heartfelt

18:25.640 --> 18:28.043
and what happens with the
sister, heartbreaking.

18:29.930 --> 18:31.210
I also like the whole thing

18:31.210 --> 18:33.830
about the main character being
a writer of children's books

18:33.830 --> 18:35.183
with dreams of success.

18:37.010 --> 18:39.490
- Inspired by personal experiences.

18:39.490 --> 18:40.323
- Uh huh.

18:40.323 --> 18:43.340
The main character even has
a similar name Betsy Simmons.

18:43.340 --> 18:46.130
- I've never named a
character after myself before.

18:46.130 --> 18:46.963
- Uh huh.

18:46.963 --> 18:49.293
However, I did not like the publisher

18:49.293 --> 18:52.373
who may have been a con artist.

18:57.710 --> 18:58.543
- Sorry.

19:00.410 --> 19:03.343
- All writers draw from
experience one way or another.

19:04.390 --> 19:07.070
Even if your facts weren't quite right.

19:07.070 --> 19:07.903
Anyway.

19:09.510 --> 19:12.500
Even though most would
consider it a religious novel,

19:12.500 --> 19:14.890
I think the story has
great crossover appeal

19:14.890 --> 19:17.523
to both religious and mainstream markets.

19:18.730 --> 19:20.340
I know a couple of publishers

19:20.340 --> 19:22.140
who might be interested in the book.

19:23.380 --> 19:26.800
But, before I can send it to them

19:28.660 --> 19:31.823
I need to become your agent.

19:41.130 --> 19:42.223
No money up front.

19:45.670 --> 19:49.440
I get the usual 15%
but only when they pay.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.140
I'm willing to do this if you are?

19:53.740 --> 19:55.293
If you will trust me?

20:01.719 --> 20:02.552
- Okay.

20:05.785 --> 20:08.535
(peaceful music)

21:15.020 --> 21:16.579
He did it Wishes.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.390
(cat meows)

21:18.390 --> 21:20.593
God is still answering my prayers.

21:21.858 --> 21:24.608
(peaceful music)

21:53.549 --> 21:55.882
(cat meows)

22:14.250 --> 22:17.324
You don't start helping out,
you're not getting any of this.

22:17.324 --> 22:19.657
(cat meows)

22:21.593 --> 22:24.343
(peaceful music)

22:34.224 --> 22:35.057
Perfect.

22:40.757 --> 22:43.840
(funky upbeat music)

22:50.423 --> 22:53.317
(peaceful piano music)

22:53.317 --> 22:56.317
(people chattering)

23:01.120 --> 23:03.273
- Terrence has a very
unique writing style.

23:05.732 --> 23:08.565
(doorbell chimes)

23:11.464 --> 23:13.910
- Ann, good to see you.

23:13.910 --> 23:15.950
- Dorothy, how's he doing?

23:15.950 --> 23:19.140
- You know Terrence, he's
working the room the best he can.

23:19.140 --> 23:21.980
- Dorothy, this is Betsy
Simon, she's the author of--

23:21.980 --> 23:24.400
- Heavens to Betsy, yeah.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.170
- So you've read it?

23:26.170 --> 23:28.440
- No, but I've heard a lot about it.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.130
I'll take your coats.

23:30.130 --> 23:32.060
Help yourself to finger food and drinks

23:32.060 --> 23:34.233
and I'll let Terrence know you're here.

23:38.535 --> 23:42.120
- Mostly mainstream
authors and PR people here.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.500
I'll introduce you to them later,

23:43.500 --> 23:47.040
be yourself, talk, mingle.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.140
That's why we're here.

23:50.140 --> 23:53.610
But stay away from the
religious aspects of the book.

23:53.610 --> 23:55.800
We need to focus on the
mainstream audience,

23:55.800 --> 23:57.350
keep it low key for now.

23:57.350 --> 23:59.970
There may already be an 800
pound white gorilla in the room

23:59.970 --> 24:01.510
from the title alone.

24:01.510 --> 24:02.343
Ciao.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.623
- A white gorilla?

24:15.166 --> 24:18.530
- I think we've got Simon
and Garfunkel, England, um.

24:18.530 --> 24:19.962
- Peter and Gordon.

24:19.962 --> 24:21.724
- Yes.
- Your age is showing.

24:21.724 --> 24:22.969
(laughing)

24:22.969 --> 24:24.610
- Well let it.

24:24.610 --> 24:27.460
It was a better time, magical.

24:27.460 --> 24:30.650
- Speaking of magical, love the book.

24:30.650 --> 24:32.110
- Oh well thank you.

24:32.110 --> 24:32.943
- Me too.

24:32.943 --> 24:34.355
- So you've read it?

24:34.355 --> 24:37.927
- No, but I've heard of it.

24:37.927 --> 24:41.360
- Well, I did and it was wonderful.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.090
It reminded me a little bit
of the movie, The Family Man,

24:44.090 --> 24:46.090
you know the one with Nicolas Cage.

24:46.090 --> 24:47.363
- Oh so it's fiction?

24:50.600 --> 24:51.580
- Yes.

24:51.580 --> 24:53.070
- Oh tell us a little bit about it

24:53.070 --> 24:55.223
from the mouth and the mind of the author.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.970
- Well it follows the lead
character, Betsy Simmons.

25:00.970 --> 25:01.803
- Simon.

25:01.803 --> 25:03.440
- Simmons.
- Oh.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.070
- She is a children's book author

25:05.070 --> 25:07.850
who prays for a big
publishing deal to happen

25:07.850 --> 25:10.560
and then when it doesn't she blames God

25:10.560 --> 25:15.560
for not answering that, or
any of her other prayers ever.

25:15.630 --> 25:18.350
Then all of a sudden, He does.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.723
He answers all of them at once.

25:21.780 --> 25:25.783
- So it's like the book The
Shack, a book about God.

25:28.180 --> 25:29.190
- No.

25:29.190 --> 25:30.943
- It's doing very well.

25:31.830 --> 25:32.780
- A Christian book?

25:34.140 --> 25:35.240
- No.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.704
- It's a book everyone can enjoy.

25:37.704 --> 25:38.537
- Hmm.

25:40.570 --> 25:43.310
- It's such a heartfelt, delightful story.

25:43.310 --> 25:44.853
You'll laugh, you'll cry.

25:49.065 --> 25:54.065
- (clears throat) Are you
just as bored as I am?

25:56.480 --> 25:58.300
- It could be worse.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.183
Beats moving around new furniture.

26:03.030 --> 26:07.053
- Are you an author, an agent or other?

26:08.530 --> 26:09.363
- An author.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.193
And you?

26:15.415 --> 26:18.263
- A friend of a friend
of the wife of the host.

26:20.072 --> 26:21.020
- Oh.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.086
(laughs)

26:22.086 --> 26:23.120
Other

26:23.120 --> 26:23.953
- Yeah.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.323
What's the name of your book?

26:28.200 --> 26:29.453
- Heavens to Betsy.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.793
And I'm sure you haven't read it.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.630
- No.

26:35.630 --> 26:36.463
- Of course not.

26:37.620 --> 26:38.970
- Interesting title though.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.303
- How's that?

26:44.790 --> 26:46.813
- The phrase Heavens to Betsy.

26:49.803 --> 26:52.070
(laughs)

26:52.070 --> 26:53.670
Alright.

26:53.670 --> 26:58.670
It's a mild American exclamation
of shock or surprise.

26:59.090 --> 27:02.530
It's dated, only really
encountered in print

27:02.530 --> 27:04.230
and then most often as

27:05.320 --> 27:07.773
an evocation of times past.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.170
It was also used as a
substitute for swearing,

27:12.170 --> 27:15.940
but where it comes from
nobody has the slightest idea.

27:15.940 --> 27:17.506
- Betsy.

27:17.506 --> 27:18.339
Betsy.

27:20.120 --> 27:20.953
- I gotta go.

27:21.870 --> 27:24.573
I guess you'll just have
to buy it to find out.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.110
Nice meeting you.

27:33.430 --> 27:34.263
- Hello.

27:35.910 --> 27:36.847
Yeah.

27:36.847 --> 27:39.430
(upbeat music)

27:43.800 --> 27:44.673
- Betsy Simon.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.293
- Yes (laughs).

27:49.120 --> 27:50.129
- Terrence McAfee.

27:50.129 --> 27:51.310
The host.

27:52.695 --> 27:55.290
But, not a very good one as you can see

27:55.290 --> 27:57.640
by how long it's taken me
to finally speak to you.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.143
- Oh no, hi.

28:00.030 --> 28:00.863
- Welcome.

28:04.990 --> 28:08.939
So I'm um, I'm told we
have something in common.

28:08.939 --> 28:10.873
(coughs) The same agent.

28:12.156 --> 28:14.280
- Oh, yes.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.590
She any good?

28:15.590 --> 28:17.367
(laughing)

28:17.367 --> 28:19.653
- Oh I like you already.

28:20.510 --> 28:21.343
- Is she?

28:23.260 --> 28:27.440
- Yes, but don't feel
obligated to tell her that.

28:34.064 --> 28:36.010
Yep, she knows her stuff.

28:36.010 --> 28:38.959
She can come off a bit cold, or you know,

28:38.959 --> 28:40.253
impersonal at times.

28:40.253 --> 28:42.123
It's the nature of the beast.

28:43.045 --> 28:46.513
Do what she says, you'll
make a lot of money.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.990
Your book, now I'm told
it's doing really well.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.890
- Oh, yes, yes.

28:52.890 --> 28:55.563
I've been blessed.

28:57.020 --> 28:58.623
- So you're a Christian writer?

29:04.183 --> 29:06.016
- Uh, no, not exactly.

29:09.430 --> 29:11.063
- I'm just curious.

29:17.557 --> 29:20.890
(peaceful hymnal music)

29:32.067 --> 29:33.170
- Ah, you in a hurry?

29:33.170 --> 29:35.230
- There is an Elvis
Presley movie marathon on

29:35.230 --> 29:38.225
this afternoon and
Clambake comes on at two.

29:38.225 --> 29:40.500
- Oh Clambake, is that a movie?

29:40.500 --> 29:41.543
- Oh it's a classic.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.590
- Wow, well I didn't know
you were an Elvis fan.

29:45.590 --> 29:47.220
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.053
Thank you.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.900
Thank you very much.

29:49.900 --> 29:51.280
It's really just all in the lip.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.613
- Oh.
- Oh okay.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.970
Okay, just this one.

29:56.970 --> 29:58.130
Whoa, whoa, something's happening here,

29:58.130 --> 29:58.963
something's different.

29:58.963 --> 29:59.796
Um.

29:59.796 --> 30:02.240
Oh, no glasses.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.840
- Yep, the book sales are doing well

30:03.840 --> 30:07.323
so I finally saved enough money for Lasik.

30:07.323 --> 30:08.310
- Nice.

30:08.310 --> 30:11.130
- Speaking of the book,
tell me you've read it.

30:11.130 --> 30:13.793
- I'm so sorry I haven't,
but I promise I will.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.813
- Oh okay.

30:20.010 --> 30:24.408
Hypothetically, would it be okay

30:24.408 --> 30:29.408
for someone to keep their faith low key

30:31.000 --> 30:32.313
for the sake of success?

30:33.250 --> 30:34.083
- Low key?

30:34.083 --> 30:35.670
- The other day I went to a party with Ann

30:35.670 --> 30:37.510
to promote my book.

30:37.510 --> 30:39.910
And of course there were
a lot of people there

30:39.910 --> 30:43.073
associated with the mainstream market.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.360
So Ann told me that I needed
to keep the faith aspects

30:47.360 --> 30:50.147
of my book out of
conversations with others.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.550
- [Pastor John] And?

30:55.320 --> 30:57.550
- I did what she told me to do.

30:57.550 --> 30:58.988
- Hmm.

30:58.988 --> 31:02.323
- I pretty much denied my
faith and being a Christian.

31:04.020 --> 31:05.740
Three times.

31:05.740 --> 31:06.877
- Three times huh?

31:08.080 --> 31:09.330
- It was a bit like Peter

31:10.410 --> 31:13.923
and I felt really guilty afterwards.

31:15.034 --> 31:15.990
- Whoever denies Me before men

31:15.990 --> 31:18.480
will be denied before the Angels of God.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.680
- I know, I know.

31:19.680 --> 31:23.008
- Betsy, you know, it's
the 21st Century and,

31:23.008 --> 31:25.070
there's so much political correctness

31:25.070 --> 31:27.340
and the fear of being labeled a fanatic,

31:27.340 --> 31:30.943
it just makes it harder than
ever to stand for something.

31:31.970 --> 31:33.533
Especially for Him.

31:35.028 --> 31:35.861
- I know.

31:35.861 --> 31:38.500
And I don't have a problem
doing that one on one,

31:38.500 --> 31:40.610
but in public, I mean
that's a whole other story.

31:40.610 --> 31:42.290
It's, it's so difficult.

31:42.290 --> 31:43.210
I mean in the other life,

31:43.210 --> 31:46.633
I had to speak in front of a
group of atheists, it, it...

31:46.633 --> 31:50.383
(suspenseful music)

31:50.383 --> 31:55.097
I mean, in the book, the character, Betsy,

31:56.190 --> 32:00.252
had to speak in front of
an atheist organization

32:00.252 --> 32:05.252
and it was very, very difficult for her.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.773
- Your book has now just gone
to the top of my to do list.

32:13.725 --> 32:16.475
(peaceful music)

32:18.383 --> 32:21.976
(melancholy music)

32:21.976 --> 32:23.976
(sighs)

32:44.652 --> 32:46.652
(moans)

32:48.500 --> 32:49.606
(cat meows)

32:49.606 --> 32:51.461
- I'm really sorry girl.

32:51.461 --> 32:54.128
(phone buzzing)

32:56.760 --> 32:57.830
Hi Ann.

32:57.830 --> 33:00.380
- You missed the phone
interview with Chicago Magazine.

33:00.380 --> 33:01.213
- I did?

33:04.820 --> 33:06.530
I am so sorry.

33:06.530 --> 33:09.380
- I'll see what I can do,
but this is the second time.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.393
- I know, I know.

33:13.270 --> 33:16.530
It's just getting harder to
do all these appearances,

33:16.530 --> 33:20.500
and interviews, and still keep my job.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.590
- Well if your book keeps selling,

33:22.590 --> 33:25.257
you may not need that job anymore.

33:25.257 --> 33:27.309
I'll reschedule the interview,

33:27.309 --> 33:31.420
but these are busy people
with limited availability.

33:31.420 --> 33:35.430
Plus, I've had a request for
you to do a podcast appearance.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.930
And what about your next book?

33:38.700 --> 33:40.580
- My next book?

33:40.580 --> 33:43.240
- Many authors deliver two novels a year.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.470
You're gonna need to start writing soon.

33:45.470 --> 33:46.303
Any ideas?

33:46.303 --> 33:47.770
- No.

33:47.770 --> 33:49.280
I haven't really thought about it.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.810
- Well you should.

33:50.810 --> 33:53.180
We need to use the exposure
gained from this one

33:53.180 --> 33:54.650
to promote the next.

33:54.650 --> 33:56.170
- Okay.

33:56.170 --> 34:00.970
Um, I'll start thinking
about what I wanna do next.

34:00.970 --> 34:02.950
- With all due respect Betsy,

34:02.950 --> 34:06.620
you really should get a
better handle on your time.

34:06.620 --> 34:09.560
Have you considered hiring a
part time personal assistant?

34:09.560 --> 34:10.393
- Okay.

34:11.652 --> 34:12.485
Okay.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.719
I'm really sorry Ann.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.080
- We'll talk later.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.033
Kisses to Wishes.

34:24.757 --> 34:27.674
(melancholy music)

34:31.616 --> 34:34.650
(cat meows)

34:34.650 --> 34:37.199
- Where in the world am I gonna find a PA?

34:43.449 --> 34:46.449
(suspenseful music)

35:05.093 --> 35:06.080
- Good morning.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.230
Hi, how can I help you?

35:08.420 --> 35:09.403
- Brian.

35:10.580 --> 35:12.180
- Yes.

35:12.180 --> 35:13.013
Have we met?

35:15.640 --> 35:17.797
- No, no.

35:17.797 --> 35:18.797
No, no, no.

35:18.797 --> 35:22.670
But I had a feeling it
was one of those B names,

35:22.670 --> 35:27.640
you know like Benson
or Beltron, nevermind.

35:27.640 --> 35:28.712
- What size?

35:28.712 --> 35:29.670
- What?

35:29.670 --> 35:30.503
- Shoe size.

35:31.633 --> 35:34.159
- Oh, oh yes.

35:34.159 --> 35:36.488
A nine.

35:36.488 --> 35:39.613
- Well, let me see if
we have these in a nine.

35:40.640 --> 35:44.013
Have a seat and I'll be right with you.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.110
Okay, I couldn't find
that particular color,

35:52.110 --> 35:54.730
but let's just try this style

35:54.730 --> 35:57.513
and just make sure we get
a good fit there first.

36:01.220 --> 36:02.053
- Oh my.

36:04.221 --> 36:06.680
What service.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.910
- Well, you know we've been in business

36:08.910 --> 36:11.620
for quite some time now

36:11.620 --> 36:14.350
and we do things the way we always have.

36:14.350 --> 36:16.983
- Oh I see.

36:17.977 --> 36:21.720
And what do you do here?

36:21.720 --> 36:23.453
I mean are you just a salesman?

36:26.450 --> 36:27.583
- I'm the store manager.

36:28.530 --> 36:31.610
- Ah, right, right.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.017
No of course.

36:33.017 --> 36:36.708
You're so good at keeping track of things

36:36.708 --> 36:39.760
and numbers and organizing, all of that.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.500
No, that makes sense,
that makes perfect sense.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.410
Of course you'd be a store manager.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.243
Perfect.

36:46.202 --> 36:47.035
- So how does that feel?

36:47.035 --> 36:49.220
- How long have you been doing this?

36:50.280 --> 36:51.780
- What?

36:51.780 --> 36:53.400
- This.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.793
Managing, the store?

36:55.960 --> 36:57.430
- Oh, 26 years.

36:57.430 --> 37:02.044
- Hmm, wow and have you
ever given any thought

37:02.044 --> 37:05.530
about doing another line of work?

37:05.530 --> 37:08.713
Maybe something similar, but
you know, a little different.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.250
- I suppose.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.830
- See that's kind of what happened to me.

37:12.830 --> 37:16.708
I'm doing something that
I've always wanted to do.

37:16.708 --> 37:18.860
- How does that feel?

37:18.860 --> 37:20.313
- Well, I mean that's why I'm here.

37:20.313 --> 37:21.990
Things are getting out of hand

37:21.990 --> 37:24.880
and I really could use some
help keeping it all together.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.223
- I, I meant the shoe.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.500
- Oh right the shoe.

37:29.500 --> 37:30.333
Um.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.807
It's not really what I'm looking for.

37:36.333 --> 37:37.478
- Alright.

37:37.478 --> 37:39.395
And what might that be?

37:40.410 --> 37:41.243
- Well.

37:46.420 --> 37:47.253
You.

37:48.826 --> 37:49.659
- Me?

37:49.659 --> 37:51.053
- I have a proposition for you.

37:52.890 --> 37:55.400
I know it might sound a little weird,

37:55.400 --> 37:57.700
and I don't mean it in
any inappropriate way.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.610
- No one ever does.

37:59.610 --> 38:04.010
- But I wanna talk to you, not here.

38:04.010 --> 38:05.620
Can I buy you lunch?

38:05.620 --> 38:09.330
My name is Betsy Simon, I'm an author.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.540
My latest book Heavens to Betsy
is on the bestsellers list.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.450
- Oh, congratulations.

38:14.450 --> 38:15.710
- Thank you.

38:15.710 --> 38:19.190
The thing is my career is
really starting to take off

38:19.190 --> 38:21.000
and I'm losing my mind.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.780
I've worked full time at a dentist office

38:22.780 --> 38:24.873
as a receptionist for a long time now.

38:25.910 --> 38:28.040
And because of the success of the book

38:28.040 --> 38:31.590
I've been doing these interviews,
appearances, podcasts,

38:31.590 --> 38:33.801
you name it.

38:33.801 --> 38:36.973
And it's beginning to be a
lot more than I can handle.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.990
My agent wants me to start
working on my next book,

38:40.990 --> 38:42.140
which I'm trying to do

38:42.140 --> 38:44.410
but it's just getting to be more and more

38:44.410 --> 38:48.233
than I can handle alone.

38:50.420 --> 38:51.670
That's where you come in.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.433
- Me?

38:55.433 --> 38:58.220
- You're really good at
organizing and managing things.

38:58.220 --> 39:01.640
That's why you're a store manager.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.600
Yeah, you were born for that.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.910
- So you're planning on
opening a shoe store?

39:05.910 --> 39:06.743
- Yes.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.053
No, no, no.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.410
I need a PA.

39:13.410 --> 39:14.520
- PA?

39:14.520 --> 39:17.430
- A personal assistant.

39:17.430 --> 39:18.423
- How personal?

39:20.260 --> 39:22.100
- You would help me do what I do.

39:22.100 --> 39:23.867
- But you write books.

39:23.867 --> 39:25.410
- Yeah, yeah I know.

39:25.410 --> 39:28.100
- So what does this have to do with shoes?

39:28.100 --> 39:29.340
- Nothing.

39:29.340 --> 39:33.610
- Alright, well I don't
understand why we're talking.

39:33.610 --> 39:34.780
Other than the possibility

39:34.780 --> 39:36.870
that you actually are losing your mind,

39:36.870 --> 39:38.660
in which case I'm not gonna be interested

39:38.660 --> 39:41.390
in any proposal of any kind.

39:41.390 --> 39:42.223
- Alright.

39:43.854 --> 39:45.880
I'll tell you the truth.

39:45.880 --> 39:49.290
With God as my witness,
maybe he'll intervene.

39:49.290 --> 39:51.260
As crazy as it sounds,

39:51.260 --> 39:55.160
you and I have worked together before.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.140
You were my personal assistant

39:59.010 --> 40:00.680
and you were good at what you did.

40:00.680 --> 40:03.380
And you helped me through
some very difficult times,

40:03.380 --> 40:07.920
both professionally and as a friend.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.900
And the reason you don't
remember any of this

40:09.900 --> 40:12.130
is because it happened
in an alternate reality

40:12.130 --> 40:15.280
where God was showing me what
my life would have been like

40:15.280 --> 40:17.760
had all of my prayers been answered.

40:17.760 --> 40:18.853
It's all in my book.

40:19.990 --> 40:21.990
So I decided to track
you down on the internet

40:21.990 --> 40:24.710
and see if, maybe, you wanted
to work for me in this life

40:24.710 --> 40:27.623
because you were so good
at it in the other one.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.113
- Right.

40:32.519 --> 40:37.519
Well I, I have to get going Miss Simon.

40:40.790 --> 40:45.790
'Cause I uh, I'm due back on planet Earth.

40:46.020 --> 40:46.853
- Wait.

40:49.410 --> 40:50.593
Brian, your watch.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.420
That's the watch that your father gave you

40:56.420 --> 40:58.223
a couple of weeks before he died.

41:00.950 --> 41:03.130
- You saw that on the internet?

41:03.130 --> 41:04.660
- No, no, no, no.

41:04.660 --> 41:08.383
That was something that you
had told me in the other life.

41:11.450 --> 41:13.320
Okay, just think about it alright.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.840
Take my card, think about it.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.340
You wouldn't even have to quit your job.

41:17.340 --> 41:20.360
It'd be part time, I'd show
you everything you need to know

41:20.360 --> 41:22.420
and pay you whatever you think is fair.

41:23.572 --> 41:26.489
(melancholy music)

41:32.230 --> 41:34.897
(upbeat music)

41:38.700 --> 41:41.700
- This is Tammy Moore, on
today's Chi-Town Book Review

41:41.700 --> 41:44.556
my guest is book author
Betsy Simon, welcome.

41:44.556 --> 41:47.120
- Thanks for having me Tammy.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.070
- So your first books which
feature your cat Wishes,

41:50.070 --> 41:51.290
you wrote for children.

41:51.290 --> 41:53.450
Heaven to Betsy is clearly an adult novel,

41:53.450 --> 41:56.220
but it does have some childlike elements.

41:56.220 --> 41:58.313
Maybe left over from your earlier books?

41:59.660 --> 42:00.530
- How's that?

42:00.530 --> 42:02.740
- It reminded me of a children's story.

42:02.740 --> 42:06.103
Like Willy Wonka or Wizard of Oz.

42:07.920 --> 42:08.753
- Really?

42:08.753 --> 42:11.970
- Hmm-mm, yes it's kind of
like an adult morality story

42:11.970 --> 42:15.200
with a childlike,
simplistic message of sort.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.530
How big a part did your
real experiences play

42:17.530 --> 42:19.083
in creating a work of fiction?

42:21.770 --> 42:22.603
- Uh.

42:27.800 --> 42:28.833
It's not fiction.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.180
- Sorry?

42:31.180 --> 42:32.130
- It's not fiction.

42:33.290 --> 42:37.260
Everything that happened in
that book, really happened.

42:37.260 --> 42:39.480
God put me in an alternate reality

42:39.480 --> 42:41.660
and showed me what my
world would have been like

42:41.660 --> 42:43.470
had all of my prayers been answered.

42:43.470 --> 42:46.543
Then he put me back and
I wrote a book about it.

42:48.060 --> 42:49.090
- Brought you back?

42:49.090 --> 42:49.960
- Yes.

42:49.960 --> 42:50.830
- From where?

42:50.830 --> 42:52.653
- An alternate reality.

42:55.040 --> 42:55.873
- He did?

42:56.770 --> 42:59.000
- Yeah, He did.

42:59.000 --> 42:59.833
- God.

43:02.820 --> 43:03.653
- God.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.450
- And how's that even possible?

43:09.450 --> 43:10.740
- Got me.

43:10.740 --> 43:12.880
- Well I certainly have a few
prayers I'd like answered.

43:12.880 --> 43:14.143
Can you say a few for me?

43:16.080 --> 43:19.850
(suspenseful music)

43:19.850 --> 43:21.620
Well you heard it here first everyone.

43:21.620 --> 43:26.540
Betsy Simon's book Heavens
to Betsy is based on fact,

43:26.540 --> 43:28.427
not fiction, how about that?

43:30.646 --> 43:33.729
(funky upbeat music)

43:40.650 --> 43:42.570
- What are you doing?

43:42.570 --> 43:43.500
- Watching TV.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.560
- No, the podcast.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.400
- I made a promise to tell the truth.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.650
- The truth?

43:48.650 --> 43:49.680
- I know how it sounds.

43:49.680 --> 43:50.513
- Do you?

43:51.390 --> 43:53.340
So you are telling me

43:53.340 --> 43:55.750
and everyone else who watched that podcast

43:55.750 --> 43:58.310
that you traveled to
an alternate dimension,

43:58.310 --> 44:01.860
or reality, or universe,
or whatever and came back?

44:01.860 --> 44:02.693
- Yep.

44:03.830 --> 44:06.160
- Are you sure that
was the right decision?

44:06.160 --> 44:07.400
- Nope.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.233
- Uh huh.

44:09.070 --> 44:10.830
I don't know what you're going for here.

44:10.830 --> 44:13.270
But crazy is no way to sell books!

44:13.270 --> 44:15.770
I can't keep doing damage control.

44:15.770 --> 44:17.680
If I can't trust you to stay on message

44:17.680 --> 44:22.030
I can't send you out to
interviews or podcast appearances.

44:22.030 --> 44:24.340
If you're gonna keep
saying things like this,

44:24.340 --> 44:25.800
I need to know about them.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.290
Are we on the same page?

44:27.290 --> 44:28.123
- Yes.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.333
- I'm serious, you'll let me know?

44:31.227 --> 44:36.227
- I'm letting you know, right now.

44:36.300 --> 44:37.290
- What do you mean?

44:37.290 --> 44:39.310
- I've gotta go, we'll talk later.

44:39.310 --> 44:40.634
- Betsy?

44:40.634 --> 44:43.634
(suspenseful music)

44:44.956 --> 44:46.070
- What'd I miss?

44:46.070 --> 44:48.050
- During a live podcast,

44:48.050 --> 44:51.845
I did what I felt was the right
thing to do in God's eyes,

44:51.845 --> 44:56.845
and I told the interviewer
that the book wasn't fiction.

45:00.440 --> 45:01.693
- Okey doke.

45:01.693 --> 45:05.080
Okay, so if what you're saying is true

45:05.080 --> 45:08.330
and let's just say for the
sake of this very strange,

45:08.330 --> 45:11.073
but very interesting
conversation that it is.

45:12.970 --> 45:14.570
Why are you telling me all this?

45:14.570 --> 45:16.520
- Because you read the book.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.220
You believed me in the other life.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.440
- But not 'til the end of the book.

45:21.440 --> 45:24.893
- Well does it have to
take that long this time?

45:26.540 --> 45:28.210
I just thought because it was me,

45:28.210 --> 45:31.230
Betsy Simon, in this reality,
the one that you knew,

45:31.230 --> 45:34.880
that you would believe me.

45:34.880 --> 45:39.730
- So, Sandy in the book,
is your sister Sally?

45:39.730 --> 45:40.570
- Yes.

45:40.570 --> 45:45.570
- And then when God put Betsy,
well you, back into this life

45:48.000 --> 45:49.720
you had to lose her again.

45:49.720 --> 45:52.070
Why would you write about
something so painful?

45:57.350 --> 45:58.450
- Because it happened.

46:00.080 --> 46:03.843
I really need for you to believe me.

46:04.870 --> 46:07.110
Things are gonna get
complicated from here on out

46:07.110 --> 46:08.220
now that I've told the truth.

46:08.220 --> 46:11.140
- Betsy, you know, I've always
been here for you and your family

46:11.140 --> 46:13.770
and I will do my best to be here

46:13.770 --> 46:15.470
for whatever you're going through.

46:16.540 --> 46:20.243
Whether it's in this, or any reality.

46:22.550 --> 46:23.383
- I'll take it.

46:24.477 --> 46:27.227
(peaceful music)

46:35.320 --> 46:36.350
Hello.

46:36.350 --> 46:37.183
- Miss Simon.

46:37.183 --> 46:38.430
- Brian.

46:38.430 --> 46:41.503
- I'm calling to let you know that

46:41.503 --> 46:46.503
I'm not a compulsive man
and I never do anything

46:46.740 --> 46:49.340
without doing plenty of research first.

46:49.340 --> 46:51.910
So I bought your book

46:51.910 --> 46:54.370
and I watched the
podcast that you were on.

46:54.370 --> 46:55.790
- You didn't have to buy the book,

46:55.790 --> 46:57.560
I would've given you a copy.

46:57.560 --> 46:58.780
- Well that's very nice of you,

46:58.780 --> 47:01.470
but considering the circumstances
that's not necessary.

47:01.470 --> 47:03.880
- That's what I liked about you.

47:03.880 --> 47:04.810
Like.

47:04.810 --> 47:06.143
That's what I like.

47:07.080 --> 47:11.661
- Before this becomes another
episode from The Twilight Zone

47:11.661 --> 47:14.970
I just want to say that I have decided,

47:14.970 --> 47:19.970
that no matter how I much I
love my job in shoe sales,

47:20.210 --> 47:24.250
I think it's time to explore
other means of income.

47:24.250 --> 47:27.130
So I accept your offer.

47:27.130 --> 47:31.823
And we can, we can talk about
the salary next time we meet.

47:32.880 --> 47:33.793
- That's great.

47:36.290 --> 47:38.090
I'm a little busy over
here, so I've gotta go,

47:38.090 --> 47:39.870
but I will call you later

47:39.870 --> 47:42.070
with a time and a place
that we can meet up.

47:44.550 --> 47:45.570
Thank you.

47:45.570 --> 47:47.537
- Well, you're welcome.

47:47.537 --> 47:49.620
(laughs)

47:53.339 --> 47:58.181
- Mrs. Potterman, how
good to see you again.

47:58.181 --> 48:01.264
(funky upbeat music)

48:02.892 --> 48:03.997
(peaceful music)

48:03.997 --> 48:06.164
(sobbing)

48:07.423 --> 48:09.445
- Mrs. Poscotti, what's wrong?

48:09.445 --> 48:11.612
(sobbing)

48:13.070 --> 48:15.750
No Mrs. Poscotti, you didn't?

48:15.750 --> 48:17.750
- Of course not, I paid the newspaper kid.

48:17.750 --> 48:18.927
Can we do this now?

48:19.965 --> 48:22.132
(sobbing)

48:34.611 --> 48:36.387
(funky upbeat music)

48:36.387 --> 48:39.220
(TV audience applauding)

48:39.220 --> 48:41.210
- We're here with our
guest Caroline Hopper

48:41.210 --> 48:44.190
from the organization known as N.O.G.O.D.

48:44.190 --> 48:48.506
A national organization
dedicated to getting out deities

48:48.506 --> 48:50.260
in our society.

48:50.260 --> 48:51.780
- Thank you Tandom.

48:51.780 --> 48:54.430
- So Caroline, for the sake of our viewers

48:55.354 --> 48:57.170
who are unfamiliar with
you and your organization,

48:57.170 --> 48:58.630
it's been around for how long now?

48:58.630 --> 49:02.360
- It officially began three
years ago this November.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.030
(laughs)

49:04.030 --> 49:08.577
- And, it's basically another organization

49:08.577 --> 49:11.064
that's attempting to re-enforce

49:11.064 --> 49:12.910
the separation of Church and State.

49:12.910 --> 49:15.480
- Oh no no, Tandom, we're
much more than that.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.970
We at N.O.G.O.D. are against all forms

49:17.970 --> 49:20.740
of subliminal force fed religion,

49:20.740 --> 49:23.730
even within the context of
everyday terms and phrases.

49:23.730 --> 49:25.320
- Can you give us an example?

49:25.320 --> 49:28.234
- [Caroline] Hmm, sneezing.

49:28.234 --> 49:29.730
- Sneezing?

49:29.730 --> 49:33.819
- Well not sneezing itself,
but the response God bless you.

49:33.819 --> 49:35.740
(laughs)

49:35.740 --> 49:39.100
- Okay, so you're saying that

49:39.100 --> 49:41.950
somebody could be doing this out of habit

49:41.950 --> 49:44.754
and be completely unaware
that it's happening.

49:44.754 --> 49:47.250
- Yes (laughs).

49:47.250 --> 49:48.500
- Interesting.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.200
So who's behind this Miss Hopper?

49:50.200 --> 49:52.470
- Well, all perpetrators are unknown

49:52.470 --> 49:55.450
in any proposed conspiracy Mr. Dackery.

49:55.450 --> 49:57.340
- Conspiracy?

49:57.340 --> 49:58.610
No doubt.

49:58.610 --> 50:00.010
- Well being agnostic yourself

50:00.010 --> 50:03.910
I'm sure you can agree that
religious agenda is everywhere,

50:03.910 --> 50:07.060
it's sometimes very deep
inside simple things.

50:07.060 --> 50:10.250
- Of course, but something
a little more obvious?

50:10.250 --> 50:11.990
- Well just the other day
I was watching a podcast

50:11.990 --> 50:15.760
with a young author who
wrote a book about God

50:15.760 --> 50:19.610
placing her in an alternate
universe to teach her a lesson.

50:19.610 --> 50:22.090
And then transporting her back.

50:22.090 --> 50:23.310
- [Tandom] Back where?

50:23.310 --> 50:25.340
- Well back to this universe,

50:25.340 --> 50:28.070
kind of like Alice in Wonderland.

50:28.070 --> 50:30.900
I didn't read the book, I
only watched the podcast

50:30.900 --> 50:32.870
because someone told me that N.O.G.O.D.

50:32.870 --> 50:34.090
is mentioned in the book.

50:34.090 --> 50:37.057
There's even a character
that resembles me (laughs).

50:38.580 --> 50:41.555
- Really?
- Yes (laughs).

50:41.555 --> 50:44.123
- Does she have an obnoxious giggle?

50:47.710 --> 50:49.873
- I'm sorry, giggle?

50:53.995 --> 50:56.520
- You're so bad.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.963
- Thank you.

50:57.963 --> 50:59.046
- Great show.

51:00.153 --> 51:01.575
- She's a nut.

51:01.575 --> 51:05.265
- Yeah, I know who she was talking about.

51:05.265 --> 51:10.120
That author, that wrote
that book Heavens to Betsy,

51:10.120 --> 51:13.535
I saw a clip of the podcast on Facebook.

51:13.535 --> 51:16.410
Pretty weird stuff.

51:16.410 --> 51:17.243
- How's that?

51:17.243 --> 51:20.730
- Thing is, she really believes

51:20.730 --> 51:23.345
she was in an alternate universe,

51:23.345 --> 51:26.150
just like Alice in Wonderland,

51:26.150 --> 51:28.660
and returned and wrote a book about it.

51:28.660 --> 51:29.910
- No doubt.

51:29.910 --> 51:33.430
- Like Miss Hopper said,
she could be just doing it

51:33.430 --> 51:35.510
to increase her book sales.

51:35.510 --> 51:36.840
- So?

51:36.840 --> 51:39.363
- You said you needed
some more filler shows,

51:40.440 --> 51:45.160
Tandom in Wonderland.

51:45.160 --> 51:47.360
Think of what you could do with that?

51:47.360 --> 51:50.180
We just did a show with a delusional woman

51:50.180 --> 51:52.190
who doesn't believe in God,

51:52.190 --> 51:55.933
how about one about a
delusional woman who does?

52:00.480 --> 52:02.290
- Put someone on it.

52:02.290 --> 52:03.263
- Already did.

52:04.852 --> 52:07.602
(peaceful music)

52:11.069 --> 52:14.152
(funky upbeat music)

52:17.750 --> 52:19.470
- Well I think that about covers it.

52:19.470 --> 52:20.720
You should be good to go.

52:26.340 --> 52:27.173
- [Brian] What?

52:30.295 --> 52:31.128
- Is that new?

52:31.128 --> 52:34.900
- Well I just bought it, why?

52:34.900 --> 52:37.150
- You just had one like
it in the other life.

52:38.480 --> 52:41.563
- Well, where do you think
I got the idea for it?

52:46.538 --> 52:47.580
What was it like?

52:47.580 --> 52:50.300
- What was what like?

52:50.300 --> 52:51.453
- The other life?

52:53.120 --> 52:54.163
- It was unreal.

52:55.810 --> 52:57.240
Everything was the same.

52:57.240 --> 53:02.240
The people, the places, I was
there but I was somebody else.

53:06.040 --> 53:10.283
- Betsy Simmons-Burnett, the
famous children's book author.

53:11.960 --> 53:12.793
- Yeah.

53:14.180 --> 53:17.150
Except for there I was
Betsy Simon-Bennett.

53:17.150 --> 53:21.397
Fame, fortune, it all became so important.

53:24.414 --> 53:26.603
And I turned my back on my family,

53:28.760 --> 53:30.163
and most important, God.

53:31.410 --> 53:32.750
- Aren't you afraid that maybe

53:32.750 --> 53:35.280
you'll go down that same path again?

53:35.280 --> 53:37.540
- No, I know that I'm human

53:37.540 --> 53:39.193
and that I'm gonna make mistakes.

53:40.720 --> 53:44.920
But as long as I put God
first, I'm in good hands.

53:44.920 --> 53:49.143
- Not your will, but His will be done.

53:51.671 --> 53:53.963
- (laughs) Exactly.

53:54.900 --> 53:58.620
- Well, I've got to get going.

53:58.620 --> 54:03.620
I have a lot of reading to catch up on.

54:04.550 --> 54:09.550
Oh and I'm just curious,
in the book you said

54:09.930 --> 54:12.733
that you changed all the
names of the characters,

54:13.970 --> 54:15.643
so why didn't you change mine?

54:19.711 --> 54:24.711
- Um, I guess because you
were from the other life,

54:27.490 --> 54:29.770
I didn't think it'd matter

54:29.770 --> 54:33.130
and to be honest I wasn't
even sure that you existed.

54:33.130 --> 54:33.963
- Maybe I don't.

54:40.230 --> 54:44.660
- Well for what it's worth,
it's great to have you back.

54:44.660 --> 54:47.287
- Well, I'll have to
take your word for it.

54:55.330 --> 54:56.183
Have a good day.

55:06.124 --> 55:08.957
(peaceful music)

55:21.400 --> 55:22.233
- [Betsy] Hi.

55:25.020 --> 55:26.460
- Oh hi.

55:26.460 --> 55:28.126
- Mind if I join you?

55:28.126 --> 55:32.257
- Uh, no, no, not at all.

55:35.490 --> 55:36.720
- Betsy Simon.

55:36.720 --> 55:37.830
- The author right?

55:37.830 --> 55:38.663
- Yes.

55:39.933 --> 55:43.480
- Uh, Robert Trainer.

55:43.480 --> 55:45.820
- The friend of a friends
wife of this thing that yeah.

55:45.820 --> 55:48.140
- Yes, that's me.

55:48.140 --> 55:50.005
- Do you live near her?

55:50.005 --> 55:54.228
- Uh no, but I heard about this place

55:54.228 --> 55:59.228
and yeah, it's becoming a regular.

56:01.120 --> 56:03.327
Or I'm becoming a regular.

56:03.327 --> 56:04.360
(laughing)

56:04.360 --> 56:06.480
Never knew there were
Christian coffee shops.

56:06.480 --> 56:07.460
- Yeah, all the proceeds

56:07.460 --> 56:10.393
go to various Christian
charities and organizations.

56:11.419 --> 56:12.836
- I take it you are?

56:13.860 --> 56:16.023
- I am, and you?

56:17.680 --> 56:19.037
- As far as I know I am.

56:19.037 --> 56:20.803
- You sound a little unsure.

56:23.850 --> 56:27.173
- When I was a teenager,

56:28.960 --> 56:33.960
my parents sent me to this
Christian summer camp.

56:35.637 --> 56:37.387
I went with a friend.

56:41.136 --> 56:43.570
It was a lot of fun, you know,

56:43.570 --> 56:48.570
camp fires, games, girls, puberty.

56:48.960 --> 56:52.730
Each night after dinner
there was a service.

56:52.730 --> 56:56.963
Some kids would sing songs,
tell jokes or read the Bible.

56:58.280 --> 57:01.760
And then the camp leader
would try to get the kids

57:01.760 --> 57:06.760
to come to the altar, you know, to be saved.

57:09.160 --> 57:14.160
But, they were really pushy about it.

57:14.670 --> 57:17.350
- Really, in what way?

57:17.350 --> 57:21.610
- It seemed like they
wouldn't end the service

57:22.720 --> 57:25.160
until someone went to the altar.

57:25.160 --> 57:27.920
- Oh, really?

57:27.920 --> 57:32.090
- Anyway, there was this girl

57:32.090 --> 57:36.023
and I was infatuated with her.

57:37.360 --> 57:41.070
And one night she went to the altar so--

57:41.070 --> 57:43.170
- You did too.

57:43.170 --> 57:44.200
- Yeah.

57:44.200 --> 57:45.930
So even though I was way too young,

57:45.930 --> 57:50.930
to know what it meant,
I guess I was saved.

57:52.567 --> 57:53.633
- And now?

57:53.633 --> 57:54.883
- I don't know.

57:56.070 --> 57:59.043
Over the years, I've
drifted away from Church.

58:01.034 --> 58:04.233
Life has a way of complicating things.

58:05.540 --> 58:06.561
How about you?

58:06.561 --> 58:09.233
Ever been to a Christian camp?

58:11.070 --> 58:11.903
- No.

58:13.180 --> 58:14.290
No, I haven't.

58:14.290 --> 58:16.160
But I was raised in a Christian home

58:17.475 --> 58:20.600
and my parents always went
to Church when I was little.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.153
I'd say we prayed a lot.

58:25.030 --> 58:29.090
Unlike my older sister,
Sally, I loved to pray.

58:29.090 --> 58:30.730
We were close Sally and I.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.790
- Were?

58:34.790 --> 58:35.623
- Yeah.

58:37.790 --> 58:39.393
- You don't see her anymore?

58:46.010 --> 58:48.763
- She died, my mom too.

58:52.770 --> 58:53.663
- I'm sorry.

58:55.810 --> 58:56.643
- It's okay.

58:58.380 --> 59:00.010
My mom died not too long ago

59:01.746 --> 59:03.796
and when she did my dad moved to Arizona.

59:05.720 --> 59:06.620
- And your sister?

59:08.140 --> 59:09.840
- She died when we were teenagers.

59:11.430 --> 59:15.273
She was 18, I was 17.

59:17.062 --> 59:19.979
(melancholy music)

59:20.930 --> 59:22.490
- [Patient] Hi.

59:22.490 --> 59:23.323
- Can I help you?

59:23.323 --> 59:25.110
- Yes I'm here to see Dr. Jorgensen.

59:25.110 --> 59:26.410
- Please sign in.
- Okay.

59:28.174 --> 59:31.091
(melancholy music)

59:48.120 --> 59:49.783
- Where's mom and dad?

59:51.380 --> 59:53.630
- Oh, they just went to
get something to eat.

59:55.244 --> 59:57.411
(sobbing)

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.653
- It's not good.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.553
- When do you start the treatments?

01:00:10.823 --> 01:00:11.656
- I'm not.

01:00:15.007 --> 01:00:15.840
- Oh.

01:00:17.928 --> 01:00:19.030
I don't get it, why not?

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.856
- You can't stop the inevitable.

01:00:21.856 --> 01:00:23.990
I put myself through hell,

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:26.670
feel like crap, look
like crap and for what?

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:27.503
- To live.

01:00:27.503 --> 01:00:30.143
- It's stage four Betsy.

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:34.910
- Mom and dad aren't gonna let you.

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:38.830
- I'm 18, it's not up to them.

01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:40.797
- You've gotta fight this.

01:00:40.797 --> 01:00:42.214
- No, no I don't.

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:48.810
I am not gonna let them put all that crap in me

01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:53.103
and spend what time I have
left bald and throwing up.

01:00:54.613 --> 01:00:55.446
- What?

01:00:56.415 --> 01:01:00.553
- I wanna enjoy whatever time I have left.

01:01:02.553 --> 01:01:05.470
(melancholy music)

01:01:18.129 --> 01:01:20.296
(sobbing)

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:30.973
- I'll pray for you.

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:41.770
Malignant neoplasm of the
cervix, it was rare for her age.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:43.787
That's why I thought that she'd beat it.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:46.363
And she might have, had
she not been so stubborn.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:49.510
She'd be hospitalized towards the end.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.463
Wow.

01:01:54.463 --> 01:01:56.630
Maybe that was too much too soon.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.023
- Oh that's okay.

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:01.530
I was thinking the same thing, for me.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.390
Especially when I mentioned the puberty.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:07.640
(laughing)

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:13.550
Would you like to go out
for dinner one night?

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.013
- Let me think about it.

01:02:22.995 --> 01:02:23.828
- Okay.

01:02:30.318 --> 01:02:33.068
(peaceful music)

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.630
- For those of you just tuning in tonight

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:38.380
on Chicago Christian Network,

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:42.400
we have with us a very interesting
and controversial guest.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.680
Who's latest book Heavens to Betsy

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.420
has generated quite a bit of interest

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:50.603
due to a recent podcast
that has gone viral.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.040
Betsy Simon, you said
that you had to be honest

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.643
and tell the truth?

01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:59.970
- Yes Grace.

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:02.182
- Apparently you also are generating

01:03:02.182 --> 01:03:04.280
a bit of negative publicity,
both you and your book.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.883
People have called you crazy.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:10.790
A self proclaimed phony
baloney prophet is it?

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:11.990
- And worse.

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.823
- Oh really.

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:16.823
Well I want you to know
that I for one, believe you.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.050
- Thank you.

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:22.610
- A book like this can
impact so many people,

01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:24.700
I mean not just Christians,

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.470
but people of all different
faiths and backgrounds.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:32.010
And so what if not everyone
believes that it happened.

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:36.280
Pick up the book, read it,
and decide for yourselves.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.170
Heavens to Betsy, the book.

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:44.170
An amazing testimony into
understanding God's will

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.373
and one woman's spiritual journey.

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:49.713
- [Betsy] I like the new look.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.493
- Thank you.

01:03:52.493 --> 01:03:55.790
Oh you have a 4:00 p.m.
phone interview tomorrow

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:59.110
with the Christian Faith News Program

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:03.886
and oh, there's a Pastor Thomas
from a Church in the city

01:04:03.886 --> 01:04:08.564
and he would like you to speak
before his sermon on Sunday.

01:04:08.564 --> 01:04:09.412
- Really?

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:11.580
In front of the whole Church?

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.413
- Yes.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.720
It looks like you're a hit

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.060
with the Christians and
religious organizations

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.030
ever since your interview
with Miss Staples.

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:21.492
- That's great.

01:04:21.492 --> 01:04:24.260
You know I wasn't expecting all this.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.253
- Wishes is staring at me again.

01:04:28.459 --> 01:04:31.209
(cheerful music)

01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:34.900
- You know what they say about animals,

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.557
they can sense things.

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:44.010
- [Robert] I saw you on
that Christian TV show.

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:46.250
- How did you know about--
- Your website.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:49.487
- Oh, it shows how little I
can keep track of those things.

01:04:49.487 --> 01:04:50.450
- Yeah.

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:52.143
- Thank God for Brian.

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:54.893
- Brian?

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.420
- Brian, yeah, he's my personal assistant.

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:02.803
- Like Brian.

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.690
Betsy Simmons-Burnett's PA in the book.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.473
- You read it?

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.040
- You told me to buy it.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.350
- Okay, so where do you stand?

01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:19.900
- Well you gotta admit,
it's pretty hard to believe.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.650
- I know, I'm pretty used
to people looking at me

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.540
like I'm a total crazy person.

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:28.123
- Well maybe I am
attracted to crazy women?

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.998
- And who are you Robert Trainer?

01:05:42.998 --> 01:05:47.985
- Uh, I come from a very poor family.

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:50.860
I lost my father when I was a boy.

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.010
Moved with my mom and sister to Chicago

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:54.380
after I graduated high school.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.940
Went to Chicago State
University, graduated

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.870
and now I'm an intern in the city.

01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:02.320
My favorite color is purple,

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.430
pizza is my comfort food and
I love Swiss almond ice cream.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:09.650
And I have a bad habit of
picking my nose, at stop signs.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.433
Too much?

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.093
- Yeah.

01:06:18.093 --> 01:06:22.100
- Seriously, I'm a nobody right now,

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:26.733
hoping that someday I'll be a somebody.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.753
Just like Betsy Simmons did in the book.

01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:34.240
- Are you sure you read it?

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.073
- Yes.

01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:37.203
Why?

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.890
- I don't know if you wanna
be that kind of somebody.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.480
- She was on Christian talk show recently,

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.335
and they believed her.

01:06:48.335 --> 01:06:49.180
- Well, that's not surprising.

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.960
- She's pretty convincing.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.700
Either she's one of the
best manipulators I've seen

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:58.079
in a long time or she really
believes what she says.

01:06:58.079 --> 01:07:00.993
- So now she's playing
to the Christian market.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.380
Smart move, God bless her.

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:08.756
- I know, but I was just thinking about

01:07:08.756 --> 01:07:13.080
the Dr. Hager interview we
did, the plastic surgeon.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.250
- Oh, the guy from Indonesia.

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:15.680
- Didn't even have his license,

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.410
performed all those surgeries.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.510
- Yeah, that was like 60 minute stuff.

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:21.070
- Our highest rated show.

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:22.900
- No doubt.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:23.733
- Don't do that.

01:07:24.744 --> 01:07:26.140
- I'm sorry.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.093
How is this even close?

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.780
- Maybe we can make it sound that way?

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.310
Like she's fooling Christians.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:38.460
Using their faith to sell books.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.950
That won't be hard,

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:44.583
especially if you can get
her to break down on camera.

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.950
- Okay, let's do it.

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.303
Give me a copy of her book.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.740
You're good.

01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.603
- I know.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.810
But there is one problem, though.

01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:08.070
Her agent told us she said no.

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:11.752
Quote "I'm not stepping
one foot on that set."

01:08:11.752 --> 01:08:14.510
- Patty, what are we doing here?

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:15.850
- What if we told her

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:19.015
we'll do the interview wherever she wants.

01:08:19.015 --> 01:08:20.090
- Where?

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.810
- The Church she goes to is very old

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.939
and they're trying to
raise money for repairs

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:26.912
to keep it open.

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:31.040
What if we offer to
make a sizeable donation

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.843
in exchange for doing the interview there?

01:08:35.435 --> 01:08:36.859
- That could be fine.

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:38.510
- [Patty] I'll contact her agent.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:42.527
- Like you said, we're
still gonna need something

01:08:42.527 --> 01:08:44.827
that'll make her lose
it during the interview.

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.483
- You have something, don't you?

01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:52.148
- Yes I do.

01:08:59.127 --> 01:09:02.130
- Do you know who Tamdon Dackery is?

01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:05.930
- I do, I am not fond of him, but I do.

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:07.830
- He wants me on his show,

01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:09.830
but I've seen what he does to his guests

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:11.840
so I told him no.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.340
- Good, you don't need him.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.173
- I know.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:19.513
But I was thinking maybe the Church does.

01:09:20.433 --> 01:09:21.265
- How's that?

01:09:21.265 --> 01:09:23.460
- Ann called me yesterday.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.510
She says he wants to donate
to the Church's fundraiser

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:29.060
in exchange for an interview with me.

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:29.893
- Really?

01:09:29.893 --> 01:09:33.010
- A very generous donation.

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:33.843
- Uh huh.

01:09:33.843 --> 01:09:36.550
- But I already refused to do
an interview at his studio,

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:40.151
so he said he'd go anywhere that I wanted.

01:09:40.151 --> 01:09:41.740
- Why would that go to that extreme?

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.196
- I don't know, for ratings?

01:09:43.196 --> 01:09:46.779
Because he thinks I'm crazy
and wants to embarrass me?

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:48.433
That's just what he does.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.880
But I was thinking, maybe
we could do it here?

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:57.290
- Oh Betsy.

01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:58.800
- I know that the Church needs the money

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.390
and I really don't mind taking
a little verbal beating

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:04.500
and embarrassment, especially
if it will do some good.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.860
- And I bet your agents all
about it for the exposure right?

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.530
- But that's not why I'm willing to do it.

01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:10.023
What if this is God's will?

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.640
Maybe all of this is falling into place

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.473
because he wants me to do this.

01:10:17.696 --> 01:10:20.140
And the exposure will be great
for the Church's fundraiser.

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:22.230
- That would depend on Tandom Dackery,

01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:23.740
he can not only make you look foolish

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.660
for what you said about the
book, he can ruin your career.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.623
That is also something he does.

01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:32.140
- I know.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.870
- Plus the Elders would never
approve doing it for the money

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:37.420
and I would have to agree with them.

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.700
- Well, why not?

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.150
- To do so, would be to sell out.

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:42.780
It would dishonor God.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.282
No, it would have to
be for another reason.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:47.780
A matter of faith for example.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.320
It is wonderful that you would consider

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.010
risking your career for the
Church, it means the world.

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:56.920
And it shows that even
with all your success,

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.780
it hasn't changed who
you are in this world,

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.590
like it did in the other one.

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:03.930
- Wait, what?

01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:05.040
So you believe me?

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.873
- No.

01:11:06.999 --> 01:11:09.749
(cheerful music)

01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:12.142
- Again?

01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:34.483
- [Tandom] Pastor John?

01:11:37.764 --> 01:11:38.597
Tandom Dackery.

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:47.343
Sorry for the intrusion.

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:50.790
- What a surprise.

01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:51.853
- I'll bet.

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:56.300
So I heard you turned
down Betsy's proposal.

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.450
- It wasn't just my decision.

01:11:58.450 --> 01:11:59.347
- Of course.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.013
Actually, that's why I'm here.

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:05.460
I just wanted to tell you in person

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.263
how much I admire that decision.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.674
Even in light of the Church's
need for financial support

01:12:12.674 --> 01:12:15.873
that they would turn
such a generous donation,

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.602
really is a story within itself.

01:12:19.602 --> 01:12:22.083
- A story for another show, not yours.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.413
- I do have a reputation, I know.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:30.913
Beautiful Church.

01:12:32.426 --> 01:12:33.326
When was it built?

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:36.390
- 1874.

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:37.223
- Really?

01:12:40.182 --> 01:12:41.840
And the bell in the
steeple, does it still ring?

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.673
- Yes.

01:12:42.673 --> 01:12:43.513
- Fantastic.

01:12:44.742 --> 01:12:47.963
It would be a shame to
have to close the doors.

01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:50.730
How's the fundraiser going?

01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:52.130
- Okay.

01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:55.630
We are hopeful that God
will hear our prayers

01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:57.140
and provide what we need.

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.293
- Or maybe he won't.

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.993
Like in Betsy Simon's book.

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:05.810
- Huh.
- You know on the other hand,

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:09.143
with her track record, maybe
she should do all the prayers.

01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:14.470
Anyway I'm sure you're a busy man.

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:16.200
I know I am.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.959
Again, I just wanted to stop by

01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:22.900
and let you know that I
really respect the decision

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.633
not to let Betsy Simon use the Church.

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.780
You know, it's pretty obvious

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.983
that she's not mentally stable.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:35.910
And an interview like this

01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:38.343
could be embarrassing
for everyone involved.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.210
- The truth is Mr. Dackery,
that you have little, if any,

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:46.823
respect for anyone you
interview on your show.

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:49.133
- That's my job.

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:53.760
And it's your job not to support
someone like Betsy Simon,

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.883
whose motivations are clearly not,

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.593
for lack of a better phrase, faith based.

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:04.307
Have a good day Pastor.

01:14:13.717 --> 01:14:18.680
Oh and Pastor, if she doesn't
wanna defend herself here.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.893
I'll just go on the air and
rip her to shreds there.

01:14:23.756 --> 01:14:26.756
(suspenseful music)

01:14:35.594 --> 01:14:38.960
(doorbell buzzes)

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.680
- Pastor John, what a surprise.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.513
- I'm sorry.

01:14:42.513 --> 01:14:44.248
I hope it's okay to show up unannounced.

01:14:44.248 --> 01:14:45.537
You know what, I should have called--

01:14:45.537 --> 01:14:47.190
- No, it's fine.

01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:48.853
Hey come on in.

01:14:48.853 --> 01:14:49.741
- Are you sure?

01:14:49.741 --> 01:14:50.574
- Yeah.

01:14:53.038 --> 01:14:55.280
(laughs)

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.230
- Uh, I need to tell you something.

01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:59.580
Um, how do I do it?

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:04.100
Okay, you know what, remember
in Rocky Two, the movie,

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.010
when Mickey his manager,

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:07.750
shows up unexpectedly at Rocky's house

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.710
because he has just heard Apollo Creed

01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:11.670
shoot his mouth off on television

01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:14.470
and now he tells him that he
should knock his block off.

01:15:17.347 --> 01:15:19.313
- I never saw Rocky Two.

01:15:21.485 --> 01:15:23.393
- Oh, uh.

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:28.070
Oh, well there goes that analogy.

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:29.400
Well then, I'm just gonna say it.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:34.400
I had a visit from Mr. Dackery,
the other day at the Church.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:36.864
- He came to the Church?

01:15:36.864 --> 01:15:39.060
- Yes, and he lived up to his reputation

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:43.728
as being just a, well
just a real piece of,

01:15:43.728 --> 01:15:46.887
well just a, just a real piece of--

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.693
- Work.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.393
- Okay, yeah that's better
than where I was going.

01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:57.833
The Elders, they have now
approved the interview.

01:16:00.663 --> 01:16:02.690
- They did?
- They did.

01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:03.740
- I don't understand.

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.850
- Well after my meeting with Mr. Dackery,

01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:09.500
I was inspired, let's say,

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.820
to go back to the Elders
with a new proposal.

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:15.350
They have approved the
use of the Church for you.

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:16.183
- Really?

01:16:17.065 --> 01:16:18.840
- Yes.
- Why?

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.280
- Betsy, you are willing
to risk your career

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.220
and make of fool of yourself

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.310
all to represent our Heavenly Father.

01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:31.060
That my dear, is a matter of faith.

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.200
There are some conditions though.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.290
The biggest one being,

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:35.050
they have got to give you a complete list

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:36.680
of all the questions they're gonna ask you

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.760
for your approval.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.410
So we can somehow minimize
the chance of embarrassment.

01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:44.140
- Yeah, I like that.
- Me too.

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:46.810
- Any advice on how I
should prepare for this?

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:49.170
- Well I would watch a Rocky movie

01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:52.930
and lots and lots of prayer.

01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:54.952
Which, you know, I read your book,

01:16:54.952 --> 01:16:57.517
so I know you're a bit of an expert there.

01:16:57.517 --> 01:17:00.267
(peaceful music)

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:05.100
- That's all for today everybody.

01:17:10.273 --> 01:17:13.194
- (clears throat) Mr. Dackery, excuse me.

01:17:13.194 --> 01:17:14.844
- Yes.

01:17:14.844 --> 01:17:16.581
- Robert.
- Robert.

01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:20.588
- There's a question here
that has to do with something

01:17:20.588 --> 01:17:24.259
she told me in private and--

01:17:24.259 --> 01:17:26.820
- Ah, the element of surprise

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:29.790
is the key to a good interview Richard.

01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:31.570
- Robert.
- Robert.

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:36.570
Unexpected responses, emotions,
drama, all good stuff.

01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:40.370
You're an intern, you'll learn.

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:44.070
- I'm sure, but in hindsight

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:46.343
it was something she told me in private--

01:17:46.343 --> 01:17:48.603
- Then you should have kept it in private.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:58.650
Though I do admire your sense
of fairness, just the same.

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:14.263
Tom.

01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:19.030
He's done.

01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.863
- Got it.

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.013
- Can you send for another one?

01:18:25.013 --> 01:18:27.763
(peaceful music)

01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:35.566
- [Betsy] Hi.

01:18:35.566 --> 01:18:37.003
- Hi.

01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:48.763
- What?

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.043
- There's something that
I think you should know.

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.970
Remember when I told you I was an intern?

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:00.010
- Yeah.

01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:03.490
- Well, I'm an intern at

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.730
Tandom Dackery's production company.

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:11.567
(melancholy music)

01:19:17.793 --> 01:19:19.150
- Really?

01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:19.983
- Yeah.

01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:24.345
- So you know about the
interview at the Church.

01:19:24.345 --> 01:19:25.595
- [Robert] Yes.

01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:30.470
- Okay, so you work for an egotistical,

01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.520
self-serving, hypocritical media vampire.

01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:34.363
- Yeah, yeah.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:38.161
But not for him directly.

01:19:38.161 --> 01:19:39.400
- So you'll be coming to the interview.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.233
- I'd like to.

01:19:43.944 --> 01:19:44.777
- Great.

01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:51.323
Look it's okay.

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.560
Alright, I'm not gonna
hold it against you.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.260
He is who he is.

01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:59.010
I gotta go, I came by just
to stop and get some coffee

01:19:59.010 --> 01:19:59.860
on my way home.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.520
I gotta prepare for the interview

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.920
and go over all the questions
that he's gonna ask me.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.753
- Betsy.

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:10.190
- What?

01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:12.280
- I'll see you at the interview.

01:20:13.714 --> 01:20:14.898
_ Okay.

01:20:14.898 --> 01:20:17.815
(melancholy music)

01:21:11.596 --> 01:21:16.596
- Are you okay?

01:21:17.153 --> 01:21:19.443
Are you comfortable with the questions?

01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:23.583
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:30.523
- Good, well then, I
will see you afterwards.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.500
- Ladies and gentleman, can
I get your attention please.

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.570
We are moments away from
starting the interview,

01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:53.420
I know we have several Tandom Dackery fans

01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:54.357
in the house today.

01:21:54.357 --> 01:21:57.179
(audience applauding)

01:21:57.179 --> 01:21:58.012
And of course I know

01:21:58.012 --> 01:22:00.061
we have some fans of
Heavens to Betsy, the book.

01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:04.520
(audience applauding) I would
just like to remind all of you

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.430
to please be respectful
throughout the interview

01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:08.880
and let everyone up here
do what they need to do.

01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:12.436
- There's a scene in the first Rocky.

01:22:12.436 --> 01:22:15.440
It's the night of the big
fight against Apollo Creed,

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.528
and Rocky he's ready to
fight, but he's worried.

01:22:17.528 --> 01:22:20.840
So he tells Adrian, that's his girlfriend

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:23.600
that it doesn't matter
if he wins the fight,

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.690
as long as he goes the distance.

01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:29.030
Because then and only then,

01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:31.880
he'll know he's not just
another bum in the neighborhood.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.013
(uplifting music)

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:40.023
Okay, have you not seen any Rocky films?

01:22:41.351 --> 01:22:43.233
- I don't know what any of that means.

01:22:43.233 --> 01:22:46.650
- What it means is that you're like Rocky.

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:48.760
You are not in this for
the fame and fortune,

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.700
you're doing it for something
that's important to you.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.163
And in this case, it's
defending the truth.

01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:56.123
Let's pray.

01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.700
Heavenly Father.

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.070
We ask that You oversee
the upcoming interview

01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:02.980
and that You will help
Betsy find the right words

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.330
to express herself, keeping to Your word.

01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:08.700
We thank you Father for
answering Betsy's prayers

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:12.231
and giving her the opportunity
for continued success

01:23:12.231 --> 01:23:13.064
in Your name.

01:23:14.165 --> 01:23:14.998
Amen.

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:18.160
Okay, what about Creed?

01:23:19.692 --> 01:23:20.525
No, no, that's one

01:23:20.525 --> 01:23:22.490
where he actually has
to train Apollo's kid.

01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:23.943
Everyone has seen Creed.

01:23:25.435 --> 01:23:28.185
(peaceful music)

01:23:30.154 --> 01:23:32.537
(people chattering)

01:23:32.537 --> 01:23:35.003
- [Ronnie] Betsy's a good friend of mine.

01:23:38.407 --> 01:23:39.750
- Oh.

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:40.583
- Ronnie Love.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.050
- Uh, sorry?

01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:47.850
- My stage name, maybe you've heard of me.

01:23:47.850 --> 01:23:49.775
- Oh no, sorry.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:53.540
- You will someday, I'm an actress.

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:58.540
I'm used to all of this,
the cameras, the lights.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.940
When I heard she was going to do this,

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:03.390
I thought I'd come just in case she needed

01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:07.320
some professional advice
about how to deal with it.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.703
- You sound like an amazing friend.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.970
She's lucky to have you.

01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:14.883
- I know right.

01:24:27.967 --> 01:24:30.023
- Tandom Dackery, the host.

01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:38.583
- Betsy Simon, the crazy Christian.

01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:40.666
(laughs)

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:43.160
- Sorry we didn't get a chance to meet

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.790
prior to the interview,

01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:46.463
that would have been the proper thing.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.010
- Yes it would have.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.140
- Ladies and gentleman.

01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:02.920
(funky upbeat music)

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.490
We are rolling.

01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:05.323
- Speed.

01:25:05.323 --> 01:25:07.033
- In three, two.

01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:10.970
- Shortly after its release,

01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:14.880
Betsy Simon's book Heavens to
Betsy hit the best seller list

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.173
and stayed there for the last six months.

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.180
The book tells the story

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:22.270
of an aspiring children's
book author who's prayer

01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:27.260
for fame and fortune is
answered by God himself.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:30.610
Transporting her to an alternate universe

01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:33.250
where not only does she
get the fame and fortune,

01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:36.383
but everything she has ever prayed for.

01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:40.280
The book has been called
a modern day Wizard of Oz

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.260
or Alice in Wonderland.

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.320
David Claymore of the Chicago Press

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.690
has called it entertaining,
heartwarming and magical.

01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:52.020
But as of late the book has
got even more attention.

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.630
Because the author claims

01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:59.253
that the story in the book
is not fiction, but fact.

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.070
Hello Betsy Simon.

01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:04.620
- Hello.

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.810
- So I read Heavens to Betsy

01:26:06.810 --> 01:26:09.163
and I thought it was delightful.

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.872
- Thank you.

01:26:12.872 --> 01:26:14.622
- When did you start writing books?

01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:19.470
- Well, I wrote a short
story in high school

01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:24.013
that won an award, and I
just kept writing after that.

01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:28.850
- You have a mother and a
sister, who are both deceased,

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.963
and your father lives in Arizona.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.980
- I see you've done your homework.

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:38.710
Yes, that's all correct.

01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:41.491
- This is not you first
novel, is that correct?

01:26:41.491 --> 01:26:43.500
- I've written four children's books

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.120
that have featured my cat Wishes.

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.142
- Well that seems obvious,

01:26:48.142 --> 01:26:50.390
seeing as how the character
in your book Betsy Simmons

01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:53.513
has a cat named Wishes and
writes children's books.

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.180
- Right, yeah I didn't change her name,

01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.991
she wouldn't have liked that.

01:26:57.991 --> 01:26:59.520
(audience laughing)

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.920
- So when the book came out,

01:27:01.890 --> 01:27:04.913
your agent promoted it
as a work of fiction.

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:07.413
- [Betsy] Yes.

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:10.800
- And now you've said, in many interviews

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.640
that it's not fiction, is that correct?

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.830
- Yes.

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:20.083
- If that's so, then Betsy
Simmons who is obviously you,

01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:24.250
has been transported to
an alternate universe

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.193
by a cosmic entity.

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:31.366
- It's safe to say God in here.

01:27:31.366 --> 01:27:34.741
No need for political
correctness Mr. Dackery.

01:27:34.741 --> 01:27:37.919
(audience laughing)

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.740
- And what was that like?

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.350
- What?

01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:43.500
- [Tandom] Living in
an alternate universe?

01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:49.970
- It was confusing at first.

01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:51.410
- Confusing.

01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:52.308
No doubt.

01:27:52.308 --> 01:27:55.040
(audience laughing)

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.680
- It was like I was in
an alternate timeline,

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.063
like Back to the Future.

01:28:00.716 --> 01:28:02.867
- If you have God, who needs a DeLorean?

01:28:02.867 --> 01:28:04.020
(audience laughing)

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:04.950
Miss Simon.

01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:07.920
- Betsy, please just Betsy.

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:08.753
- Betsy.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.823
Are you now or have you
ever been in therapy?

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.453
- No.

01:28:16.630 --> 01:28:18.538
Why, do you need a referral?

01:28:18.538 --> 01:28:21.538
(audience laughing)

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:24.653
I'm sorry.

01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:29.313
I can understand how some people,

01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:33.090
might think that I was crazy.

01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:37.510
But there are others who don't.

01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:39.163
- Christians, to be exact.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.030
You know, ever since the reveal,

01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:44.970
your book has done quite
well in that market.

01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:47.340
Why do you think that is?

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:51.030
- Because of people of
faith know that through God

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.907
all things are possible.

01:28:53.907 --> 01:28:57.740
(audience applauding)

01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:02.740
- Isn't it unethical to exploit
religion for financial gain?

01:29:03.598 --> 01:29:07.410
- (laughs) Unethical?

01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:08.750
Exploitation?

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:11.927
Wow, did you of all people just say that.

01:29:11.927 --> 01:29:15.094
(audience applauding)

01:29:16.842 --> 01:29:20.425
- You wrote in your
book that at one point,

01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:24.663
you asked God to put you
back to your original life.

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:29.780
- If I didn't, I wouldn't
be here right now.

01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:31.230
- Hmm-mm.

01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:36.230
And by doing so, you killed
your sister didn't you?

01:29:37.428 --> 01:29:40.428
(audience groaning)

01:29:52.437 --> 01:29:53.870
Did it not that bother you

01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:57.720
that asking God to put you
back to the way things were

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.880
would essentially be killing
your sister for a second time?

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:05.270
And that by asking God to do
that, you would responsible?

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:09.683
You wrote in your book,
that after much prayer,

01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:14.090
your sister died while
you were in your teens.

01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:17.030
And then when he answered your prayer,

01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:20.873
put you into this alternate
universe, he brought her back.

01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:30.340
But that didn't go very well,

01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.010
once you found out she'd been stealing

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:35.480
from you and your husband's company.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.360
- At least I know what I did.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.900
I think you'll never forgive me.

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.391
I also know what you
guys are going to do,

01:30:42.391 --> 01:30:43.990
so just do it!

01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:46.380
- So if the book is fact,

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.450
then you, more or less,
were playing Judge and Jury

01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:54.330
in asking God to put things
back the way they were.

01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:58.713
Therefore handing your
sister a death sentence.

01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:02.003
Really?

01:31:02.911 --> 01:31:06.513
You see, I think that's
the flaw in your story.

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.710
Nobody would honestly do something

01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:11.250
that would kill somebody they loved

01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:14.960
as much as you apparently
love your sister,

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.943
all for the sake of religion.

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:23.060
In 2006, Oprah Winfrey rebuked James Frey,

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.310
author of A Million Little Pieces

01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:29.110
for lying about his past,
and portraying his book

01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:31.610
as a truthful account of his life.

01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:34.780
In her words, betraying
millions of readers.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.660
Isn't that what you're doing here?

01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:39.010
Look, I know these are
different circumstances,

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:44.567
but tell me, why should we believe you?

01:31:51.608 --> 01:31:52.525
Miss Simon.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:32:00.400
Why would God allow your sister
to die not once, but twice.

01:32:03.439 --> 01:32:06.356
(melancholy music)

01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:25.990
- [Betsy's Dad] Peanuts,
he's in a better place now.

01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:29.590
- I know papa.

01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:31.020
- [Betsy's Dad] You'll see him again.

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.110
- Not too soon I hope.

01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:36.273
- Sally, your sister's very upset.

01:32:38.890 --> 01:32:39.990
- Okay.

01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:42.310
- Betsy would you like to say a prayer?

01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:43.143
- I don't know.

01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:46.540
- How about you Sally?

01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:48.417
- Not really, he's just a--

01:32:48.417 --> 01:32:50.213
- Peanut is not just cat.

01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:58.410
Can I say it to myself papa?

01:32:58.410 --> 01:32:59.710
- Of course you can honey.

01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:04.900
We don't need to hear it, nobody does.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.940
It will just be between you and God.

01:33:09.141 --> 01:33:12.058
(melancholy music)

01:33:20.210 --> 01:33:21.043
- Why?

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.753
- Why?

01:33:24.450 --> 01:33:25.983
Because it was God's will.

01:33:27.570 --> 01:33:28.740
And being a non-believer

01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.650
I don't expect you to understand that.

01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:32.560
When someone we love dies,

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.863
we say how could God let that happen?

01:33:38.364 --> 01:33:40.515
I know, I asked that question

01:33:40.515 --> 01:33:44.053
over and over again when
my sister passed away.

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:49.840
And it's so easy to blame Him

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.930
because it's so much
harder to accept the fact

01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:57.247
that these events
ultimately, have a purpose.

01:34:01.890 --> 01:34:03.363
So I leave it all up to Him.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.670
Trusting that He will show me the way

01:34:07.670 --> 01:34:09.930
to live the life that He wants me to live

01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:12.793
and be the person that He wants me to be.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.320
And I'm wanted to take
what God had shown me

01:34:17.898 --> 01:34:20.070
and share it with the world,

01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:21.940
in the only way I knew how.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.930
Through my passion for writing.

01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:27.560
A person's relationship
with God is the most intimate bond

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.530
that any human being can have.

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:33.550
And if you reject the possibility

01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:36.420
of a creator communicating
with His creation

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:40.020
well there's really nothing that I can say

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.640
that will change that.

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:46.640
Mr. Dackery, this interview
isn't about me, or my book,

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.620
or why I wrote it.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.640
It's about you, wanting
to make it look like

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.580
I'm taking advantage of Christians

01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:01.350
by appealing to their sentiments
and faiths, or whatever,

01:35:01.350 --> 01:35:03.110
in order to make money.

01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:06.790
Which is what you're doing here,

01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:09.069
for ratings and to profit off of those

01:35:09.069 --> 01:35:10.950
who don't believe in God.

01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:15.950
And that, Mr. Dackery
makes you a hypocrite

01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:19.820
or should I call you by your real name,

01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:20.653
Marione Pickle?

01:35:21.523 --> 01:35:24.523
(audience laughing)

01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:34.973
You're not the only one who
did their homework, Mr. Pickle.

01:35:37.345 --> 01:35:39.556
(audience applauding)

01:35:39.556 --> 01:35:40.747
What happened was between me and God

01:35:40.747 --> 01:35:42.597
and it doesn't matter what you think.

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.363
Any more questions?

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.143
- Nope, I think that covers it.

01:35:54.616 --> 01:35:57.783
(audience applauding)

01:36:09.001 --> 01:36:10.418
- Fade to black.

01:36:15.735 --> 01:36:17.250
- Well how about that?

01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:22.250
- Betsy has left the building,
thank you and goodnight.

01:36:22.663 --> 01:36:25.663
(upbeat rock music)

01:36:42.678 --> 01:36:43.761
You did good.

01:36:44.869 --> 01:36:47.786
(melancholy music)

01:36:53.416 --> 01:36:55.311
- So did you.

01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:56.563
- Me?

01:36:56.563 --> 01:36:57.543
What did I do?

01:36:59.470 --> 01:37:02.593
- You were there for
me, just like you said.

01:37:04.883 --> 01:37:06.383
And you know what?

01:37:07.726 --> 01:37:10.726
It doesn't matter if you believe me.

01:37:13.351 --> 01:37:15.018
- Who said I didn't?

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.223
Gotta take care of some business upstairs.

01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.403
- Good show Betsy Simon.

01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:38.973
- Really?

01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:40.803
- Really.

01:37:42.187 --> 01:37:44.570
And we want you to know,

01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:46.520
we're still going to make the donation.

01:37:48.345 --> 01:37:49.178
- What?

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.833
Even after the way it just ended?

01:37:53.010 --> 01:37:54.187
- No doubt.

01:37:54.187 --> 01:37:56.320
(laughs)

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.950
Everyone loves a hero.

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.643
Goodnight Betsy Simon.

01:38:03.858 --> 01:38:06.941
(funky upbeat music)

01:38:24.936 --> 01:38:27.853
(melancholy music)

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:30.883
- Your boss just left.

01:38:33.758 --> 01:38:34.908
- Uh, he's not my boss.

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:38.060
Not anymore.

01:38:41.243 --> 01:38:42.076
I was fired.

01:38:47.603 --> 01:38:49.770
- Oh, for being deceptive?

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:54.473
- No.

01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:00.850
I objected to him

01:39:00.850 --> 01:39:05.850
using the information that I
gave him about your sister.

01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:18.733
I'm so sorry Betsy.

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:23.860
When they asked me to get
information about you,

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:26.463
I was just doing my job.

01:39:31.379 --> 01:39:35.379
I never expected to feel
the way I do about you.

01:39:47.015 --> 01:39:49.182
I, I did a terrible thing.

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.060
Any chance you'll forgive me?

01:40:01.206 --> 01:40:02.039
- Well,

01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:06.720
You picked a good place
to ask for forgiveness.

01:40:11.909 --> 01:40:14.659
(peaceful music)

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.787
(clears throat)

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:31.220
- Uh, and there's something else.

01:40:32.290 --> 01:40:37.060
After watching you, I
decided to ask the Pastor

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:42.473
if he'd help me recommit my life to God.

01:40:44.443 --> 01:40:48.110
- You sure this isn't just
another case of infatuation?

01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.943
- No.

01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:53.343
Clarification.

01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:56.713
- Good idea.

01:40:57.686 --> 01:41:00.436
(peaceful music)

01:42:00.077 --> 01:42:00.910
Thank you.

01:42:18.487 --> 01:42:21.120
- And congratulations are in order.

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:21.953
- For what?

01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:25.973
- For Heavens to Betsy
selling a million copies.

01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:31.850
So how does it feel?

01:42:33.627 --> 01:42:34.460
- Good.

01:42:35.936 --> 01:42:37.210
She thinks so too, she feels great.

01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:40.770
Here you go.
- She's a big part of this.

01:42:40.770 --> 01:42:42.580
- Yeah I know.
- So you're not afraid

01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:45.733
of making the same mistakes again?

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.360
- No, although it is a little strange

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:55.550
that you're now dressing like
you did in the other life.

01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:59.933
- Well, one has to keep up appearances.

01:43:01.259 --> 01:43:04.540
- (laughs) You know, you sound as if

01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.393
you now believe everything I wrote.

01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:19.510
- I never told anyone that
my father gave me this watch.

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:25.921
Not in this life.

01:43:25.921 --> 01:43:28.671
(peaceful music)

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:31.890
Well, goodbye Wishes.

01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.717
- Thank you, Brian Manely.

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:46.551
(peaceful music)

01:43:58.704 --> 01:44:00.954
(laughing)

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:04.136
Goodbye.

01:44:18.565 --> 01:44:21.315
(peaceful music)

01:44:50.667 --> 01:44:52.443
(gasps)

01:44:52.443 --> 01:44:55.943
(melancholy hymnal music)

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.343
- I'm here to tell you, that I'm okay.

01:45:41.077 --> 01:45:45.300
The Sally that God showed you, wasn't me.

01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.113
Not the Sally that you loved,

01:45:48.914 --> 01:45:51.193
or the sister that you lost.

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:56.213
I left when I did, because it was time.

01:45:59.230 --> 01:46:00.730
I didn't wanna go.

01:46:03.250 --> 01:46:05.700
Sometimes it's too soon, I know.

01:46:07.105 --> 01:46:09.390
He wanted me to ease your mind

01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:12.563
and give you peace so that
you can go on with your life.

01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:19.567
- I love you.

01:46:19.567 --> 01:46:20.673
- I love you too.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.283
- So you're not here to stay?

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:30.573
- No.

01:46:33.517 --> 01:46:36.767
But I'll always be here, in your heart.

01:46:38.688 --> 01:46:42.188
(melancholy hymnal music)

01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:52.880
She's such a beautiful kitty.

01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:00.187
- Her names Wishes.

01:47:13.791 --> 01:47:16.541
(peaceful music)

01:47:56.522 --> 01:47:59.355
(peaceful music)
