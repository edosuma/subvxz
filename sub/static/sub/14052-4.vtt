WEBVTT

00:10.760 --> 00:13.880
PILOT: <i> Good evening,</i> <i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

00:10.760 --> 00:13.880
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

00:13.920 --> 00:17.200
<i>Welcome aboard</i> <i>DC-10 flight 1313.</i>

00:17.240 --> 00:20.360
<i>We will be cruising</i> <i>at a height of 25,000 feet,</i>

00:20.400 --> 00:23.160
<i>at an air speed</i> <i>of 600 miles per hour.</i>

00:23.200 --> 00:25.320
<i>Info will be provided</i> <i>upon request</i>

00:25.360 --> 00:27.520
<i>for a varied programme of</i> <i>in-flight music.</i>

00:27.560 --> 00:29.640
<i>Have a good flight.</i>

00:37.440 --> 00:40.200
And he says, "This is a 747.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.120
"Get to the back of the queue with the Airbus drivers."

00:43.160 --> 00:47.560
So as he starts to taxi he clips the tail

00:43.160 --> 00:47.560
of an Embraer 170.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.680
Now they've got him back re-training to fly an Airbus!

00:57.320 --> 00:58.640
Hey! Hey!

01:06.560 --> 01:09.600
I think you've had enough for one night, sir!

01:14.400 --> 01:16.760
Right then, shall I get another?

01:18.720 --> 01:21.080
-Not for me.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.040
-No, I think the bar's closed.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.800
MAX: Ooh, action, Adam's back.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
It's past 12:00. Oh, no!

01:30.880 --> 01:32.960
Lightweight!

01:33.000 --> 01:35.120
You won't be saying that when the crew bus arrives, Max.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.480
No! Yes.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.320
Night, Tash.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.720
Night, Adam.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.040
Right, think it's time I turned in too, actually.

01:50.080 --> 01:54.120
Ah, yeah, you need to look your best with

01:50.080 --> 01:54.120
the missus due in. Thank you.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.680
Is Helen coming here?

01:55.720 --> 01:58.240
Yeah. She gets in from LAX shortly before

01:55.720 --> 01:58.240
we leave for Heathrow.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.120
Think we've got a two-hour gap.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.480
Ah! Long distance relationships, eh, Adam?

02:04.200 --> 02:05.200
Night.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.440
-See you in the morning. -Night.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.600
Helen! So nice to have you back again.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.080
So nice to be back, Simone.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.640
You missed quite a party last night.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.080
Yeah? Well, I reckon there'll be

02:53.680 --> 02:56.080
another one tonight!

02:57.480 --> 02:59.160
It's a crew room again, I'm afraid.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.960
Oh, that's okay, I'm only here for a couple of nights.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.200
Funny. The key's not here.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.680
Just give me a moment, I'll call up the room.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.200
Hello.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.520
Baby!

03:18.160 --> 03:19.600
I've missed you!

03:19.640 --> 03:20.840
How was your flight?

03:20.880 --> 03:23.800
Oh, you know, the usual. Everything all right?

03:23.840 --> 03:24.880
Of course it is.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.720
How are you?

03:28.760 --> 03:29.800
Hey!

03:30.960 --> 03:33.160
Erm, where's Natasha?

03:33.200 --> 03:35.320
She's normally the first one down,

03:33.200 --> 03:35.320
I knocked on her door.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.920
Erm, can you call down to Natasha Thiebert's room?

03:37.960 --> 03:40.920
Erm, I'm doing it now. There's no answer.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.400
Ms Thiebert

03:51.440 --> 03:52.920
Can I come in?

03:52.960 --> 03:54.320
Tash? Morning.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.920
Bright and breezy.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.760
-Well, it's, it's very...

04:57.800 --> 04:59.600
Yes, I know. Found it at the market.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.320
Only $50, bit of a steal. Oh, I'd say so.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.120
Thought it was high time I started to blend in.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.240
-Morning, Camille. -What...

05:16.840 --> 05:19.360
So, we have

05:19.400 --> 05:23.640
Natasha Thiebert, a 35-year-old air hostess.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.640
Suspicious death.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.600
Early indications are she was poisoned, sir.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.800
CAMILLE: Lack of oxygen to the skin indicates that.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.960
Any idea how?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.400
Oh, we're guessing the killer put something

05:30.000 --> 05:33.400
into a glass of champagne.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.480
Ah!

05:42.000 --> 05:45.560
Okay, Fidel, prints, please. And get the lab to

05:42.000 --> 05:45.560
identify our poison for us.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.640
Yes, sir.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.840
Any other bottles anywhere, a container of some kind?

05:51.880 --> 05:53.360
The champagne was uncorked there,

05:53.400 --> 05:55.960
so the poisoner must have brought the poison

05:53.400 --> 05:55.960
in separately

05:56.000 --> 05:57.680
and put it in the glass.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.840
We haven't found anything, the killer must have taken it

05:57.720 --> 05:59.840
with them.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.840
I imagine we don't have a time of death, yet?

06:03.880 --> 06:07.160
No, we know she left the others around

06:03.880 --> 06:07.160
12:30 last night,

06:07.200 --> 06:08.920
her body was found at 8:40 this morning,

06:08.960 --> 06:11.040
so we're guessing she's been dead

06:08.960 --> 06:11.040
around six hours.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.920
So, that's about 2:30 a.m.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.920
Did she seem fit and well when she was last seen?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.960
She wasn't drunk or complaining

06:16.960 --> 06:19.960
of feeling unwell?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.520
-No. -Okay, who did

06:20.000 --> 06:22.520
she leave the party with?

06:22.560 --> 06:23.680
No one.

06:23.720 --> 06:24.680
Yet two glasses.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.240
The witnesses said she left alone.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.040
DWAYNE: They have CCTV in the hotel.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.120
I could get the tapes and check it out.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.560
Er, yes, please.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.720
Erm, and draw up a list of everyone

06:31.600 --> 06:34.720
she spoke to last night.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.160
Twin beds?

06:36.200 --> 06:38.520
Ah, yes, it's a crew room, they tend to share.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.000
But she wasn't?

06:40.040 --> 06:41.920
Her roommate arrived on a different

06:40.040 --> 06:41.920
flight this morning.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.680
Erm, Helen Walker.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.520
But there were three other crew members

06:45.560 --> 06:47.440
who came in on the same flight as the victim.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.880
All male. They mixed with other guests all evening,

06:47.480 --> 06:51.880
but the manager said

06:51.920 --> 06:55.400
that just the four of them were left together

06:51.920 --> 06:55.400
around midnight.

06:55.440 --> 06:59.880
Even so, let's take statements from all the guests,

06:55.440 --> 06:59.880
start eliminating people.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.160
And Fidel, take exclusion prints also,

07:02.200 --> 07:05.200
-check them against the champagne glasses.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.200
-Sir.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.120
What on Earth do you do with this?

07:19.800 --> 07:21.840
Blusher.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.480
Do women usually have this much make

07:24.480 --> 07:25.600
Air hostesses do.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.680
Mmm.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.080
She wasn't murdered for money.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.640
It's from all over the world.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.080
Anything on these?

07:45.120 --> 07:49.320
Oh, postcards home, all stamped and ready to go.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.360
Says it's her first time on the island,

07:52.400 --> 07:55.920
all the usual, although there was one...

07:57.840 --> 07:59.800
"1:00 in the morning, in my room,

07:59.840 --> 08:04.080
"just had some exciting news. Can't wait to tell you

07:59.840 --> 08:04.080
when I get back."

08:05.320 --> 08:06.600
Interesting.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.880
Anyone could have taken them.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.000
-The missing room key.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.200
Hi!

08:27.240 --> 08:29.400
I gave the guest list to one of your officers,

08:29.440 --> 08:31.640
is there something else I can help with?

08:31.680 --> 08:34.760
Er, yes. The, erm, airline staff.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.600
They're regulars, I presume?

08:36.640 --> 08:39.280
We have an arrangement with the airline, yes.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.960
You know them well then?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.520
I don't know any of them, really.

08:42.560 --> 08:45.920
They tend to keep themselves to themselves.

08:45.960 --> 08:50.200
So, you wouldn't know if anyone held a grudge

08:45.960 --> 08:50.200
against Natasha Thiebert?

08:50.240 --> 08:52.440
I wouldn't, sorry.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.920
I think I heard that it was her first time at the hotel,

08:52.480 --> 08:56.920
her first time on the island.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.600
Poor woman.

08:59.640 --> 09:04.520
She was due to share a room with a Helen Walker?

09:04.560 --> 09:09.240
Er, each room has two keys, Natasha's was in her room,

09:04.560 --> 09:09.240
but the other one was missing?

09:10.280 --> 09:13.120
Yes. It should be here.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.560
Do you think it might have been taken?

09:15.480 --> 09:16.920
It would appear so.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.080
-Yes. Of course.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.960
Good morning. La Creole Beach Hotel.

09:28.680 --> 09:32.480
I still can't believe it. I was only with her last week.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.640
You arrived in Saint

09:35.040 --> 09:36.040
Yeah.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.000
And you were all with her last night?

09:38.040 --> 09:41.520
Yeah, we were at the back of the hotel

09:38.040 --> 09:41.520
till about midnight.

09:41.560 --> 09:46.080
Was it her heart? I'm sure someone said something about

09:41.560 --> 09:46.080
her having heart problems.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.400
Yeah, I'd heard that rumour too. That was just the gossipy

09:46.120 --> 09:49.400
world of the biccy-chuckers.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.760
-That's what all the

09:49.440 --> 09:52.760
Nigels call us.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.640
Sorry, "Nigels"?

09:54.680 --> 09:56.800
The pilots.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.400
Look, she'd had her company medical a few months ago,

09:59.440 --> 10:01.920
there was nothing wrong with her heart.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.320
Yes, I can confirm that Natasha Thiebert

10:01.960 --> 10:06.320
didn't die of natural causes.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.320
This is a murder investigation.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.840
Who would do that?

10:17.320 --> 10:19.120
It's all right.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.440
That doesn't make any sense.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.400
So, she was well

10:23.440 --> 10:25.280
Yeah! I mean...

10:25.320 --> 10:28.720
I mean, I could think of 100 flight attendants

10:25.320 --> 10:28.720
people would gladly murder.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.640
Max. But not Natasha.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.800
And so she was popular?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.920
She was, she was lovely.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.560
She wasn't a party animal, not really, more homely.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.920
Talked about her family a lot.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.640
She grew up in Provence, her family are still there.

10:44.680 --> 10:48.760
She always called them, sent postcards from

10:44.680 --> 10:48.760
wherever she landed.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.240
She dreamt of packing it all in one day,

10:48.800 --> 10:53.240
going back to France,

10:53.280 --> 10:56.600
buying a little farm and living the simple life.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.480
That's what she said anyway.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.400
Yeah, postcards, yes, yes.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.040
Erm, Natasha wrote something on a postcard,

11:04.080 --> 11:05.280
when she went back to her room.

11:05.320 --> 11:09.200
Er, something about exciting news.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.640
Do any of you know what that meant?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.280
No.

11:15.320 --> 11:20.040
And, and where were you all around, er,

11:15.320 --> 11:20.040
2:30 a.m. this morning?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.680
I was in bed.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.240
We all were. We had a flight this morning.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.240
It's been cancelled.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.240
And you're in separate rooms?

11:26.280 --> 11:27.720
Yeah, pilots get single rooms.

11:27.760 --> 11:31.400
Well, I'm in a twin, but I've got it all to myself.

11:31.440 --> 11:36.880
I had a drink from the mini bar and I was

11:31.440 --> 11:36.880
asleep by 1:00.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.360
And, and you were en route from Los Angeles?

11:39.400 --> 11:43.120
Got in a couple of minutes past 7:00 this morning.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.800
And none of you saw or heard anything from Natasha

11:43.160 --> 11:46.800
after she left?

11:47.320 --> 11:48.640
No.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.520
And none of you visited her room?

11:51.120 --> 11:52.880
-No. -No.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.240
Okay. Thank you.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.440
They all seemed nice enough. Do you think they were

12:00.080 --> 12:03.440
telling the truth?

12:03.480 --> 12:05.360
Well, there were two champagne glasses in her room,

12:05.400 --> 12:07.160
so someone must have gone to see her.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.120
Unless she left them because she knew she was

12:07.200 --> 12:10.120
meeting someone else?

12:10.160 --> 12:13.000
Very true. Let's see if we can get anything new

12:10.160 --> 12:13.000
from the autopsy.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.760
SIMONE: Oh! DWAYNE: Don't be mad at me.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.600
I just said I was a little surprised to see you

12:17.880 --> 12:20.600
working here, that is all.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.520
You don't think I'm good enough for this hotel?

12:22.560 --> 12:25.200
-I didn't say that. -No, but you inferred it.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.280
Everything all right?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.320
Yes, Chief.

12:28.360 --> 12:33.040
Ms Magon here was kindly assisting us

12:28.360 --> 12:33.040
with the hotel CCTV.

12:33.760 --> 12:34.880
Oh.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.040
DWAYNE: Simone Magon seems nice enough.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.680
I'm telling you, Chief, her mother is wild,

12:44.720 --> 12:49.320
her sisters are wild. In fact, the whole family

12:44.720 --> 12:49.320
is completely out of control.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.640
You're not suggesting that she's a murder suspect?

12:51.680 --> 12:54.640
There's no link. Not if it was Natasha's

12:51.680 --> 12:54.640
first time on the island.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.160
Look, all I'm saying is it won't do any harm to run a few

12:54.680 --> 12:58.160
background checks on her.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.800
-Well, if it'll make you feel better.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.800
-Thank you, Chief.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.240
Oh, er, did you get anything from the CCTV?

13:05.280 --> 13:08.480
Only that the time code confirms their statements.

13:08.520 --> 13:12.240
Is there any way she could have been poisoned

13:08.520 --> 13:12.240
in the bar or at the party?

13:12.280 --> 13:15.520
I don't see how. She's sharing the same bottle

13:12.280 --> 13:15.520
of wine as everyone else.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.920
And she doesn't seem to eat or drink anything else

13:15.560 --> 13:18.920
when she's there.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.560
Okay, rewind to the start of the evening and see if you

13:18.960 --> 13:22.560
can spot anything untoward.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.640
Yes, Chief.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.160
Natasha's bag.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.320
I checked. It's called a lucky-dip bag.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.480
All cabin crew have one. They visit a country,

13:33.520 --> 13:36.360
if they don't use all the currency

13:33.520 --> 13:36.360
or use up whatever,

13:36.400 --> 13:38.040
they put it in their lucky-dip bag to use...

13:38.080 --> 13:39.920
To use the next time they're there, thank you.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.640
-Exactly. -Right!

13:41.680 --> 13:46.080
Natasha Thiebert goes to her room, seemingly

13:41.680 --> 13:46.080
alone, seemingly happy.

13:46.120 --> 13:50.440
Someone visits, they drink from two separate glasses

13:46.120 --> 13:50.440
of champagne, she dies.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.960
So the person she drank champagne with

13:50.480 --> 13:53.960
must have poisoned her.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.240
Which suggests it's someone she knew.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.840
Sir!

14:03.880 --> 14:05.880
I've got a match for the prints on the

14:03.880 --> 14:05.880
champagne glasses.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.720
Adam Frost.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.160
It's just a few questions, that's all.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.800
I'm not really sure we can be of much help, but...

14:21.840 --> 14:24.720
Well, actually, it's Mr Frost we'd like to speak to.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.280
Why?

14:28.960 --> 14:31.880
I think it may be best if we do this at the station.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.600
Whatever you want to say to him,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.480
you can say in front of us both,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.480
isn't that right, sweetheart?

14:37.840 --> 14:38.880
Yes.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.920
We found some fingerprints in Natasha's room.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.960
You sure you're happy to do this?

14:49.000 --> 14:52.240
Wait! You're saying you found his fingerprints?

14:55.320 --> 14:56.320
Adam?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.960
Okay, I went to her room.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.200
I didn't tell you earlier because I knew how

15:02.000 --> 15:04.200
it would look,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.640
but it's all perfectly innocent, I can assure you.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.040
-Yes.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.520
-1:30.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.600
Can we ask why?

15:14.640 --> 15:16.560
To talk about the senior steward job.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.840
We all knew it was a choice between Tash or Max,

15:18.880 --> 15:21.200
and I'd just had word from London that the job was hers.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.280
You could've waited until the morning to tell her.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.560
Yes, I could.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.800
But I knew how hard she'd worked for it,

15:25.840 --> 15:28.760
and I knew how much she wanted it.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.360
-She was having trouble with another crew member.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.240
I don't know exactly, she wouldn't tell me,

15:33.280 --> 15:34.560
although I do know it was getting her down.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.840
So, I thought she deserved a little good news.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.960
Okay, so you told her. Then what?

15:40.080 --> 15:41.480
I made my excuses to leave.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.040
<i>But she insisted on opening</i> <i>a bottle of champagne.</i>

15:48.080 --> 15:50.600
<i>We raised a glass</i> <i>to toast her success.</i>

15:50.640 --> 15:55.320
That was that. I had one glass and returned to my room

15:50.640 --> 15:55.320
shortly after.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.920
At what time?

15:56.960 --> 16:00.960
I don't know exactly. But it can't have been

15:56.960 --> 16:00.960
later than 2:00.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.040
Although no one will be able to vouch for that,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.040
will they?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.120
I think reception might.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.960
After I got back to my room, I called down to arrange

16:08.160 --> 16:10.960
a wake-up call.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.480
It was nothing.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.520
And what time was that?

16:29.640 --> 16:32.600
No, no, no, that's fine. Thank you. Bye.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.080
Oh, nice.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.080
Thank you.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.840
-Cheese and pickle.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.240
-It's an English delicacy. -Hmm.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.680
Whatever that is.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.720
Reception confirm that they had a call

16:44.720 --> 16:47.720
from Adam Frost

16:47.760 --> 16:50.520
just after 2:00 a.m. asking for a wake-up call.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.560
-Yes.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.120
Okay, well, if he's telling the truth,

16:55.160 --> 16:57.160
that explains away the two champagne flutes.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.000
It doesn't mean he didn't poison her.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.960
No, it doesn't. Though I'm struggling to see a motive.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.400
Still, it ain't over till the fat lady sings.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.160
Excuse me?

17:11.320 --> 17:12.720
What does it mean?

17:12.760 --> 17:14.400
Well, it all stems from a slightly overweight soprano

17:14.440 --> 17:17.880
of the Grand Opera... The one with

17:14.440 --> 17:17.880
the Viking helmet?

17:17.920 --> 17:21.160
When she came on and sang, you knew it

17:17.920 --> 17:21.160
was nearly the end,

17:21.200 --> 17:22.440
of the opera.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.640
And that's a British saying?

17:23.680 --> 17:25.520
Yes, it means it's not over...

17:25.560 --> 17:28.680
-Exactly.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.080
But opera's probably not a big thing on Saint-Marie.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.080
You have the, er, Tropical Caribbean Cabaret instead.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.200
The dance show?

17:35.760 --> 17:36.800
Yes.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.760
I got it from the front desk.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.280
"The world famous Tropical Caribbean Cabaret

17:44.320 --> 17:47.280
"for the true Saint-Marie experience."

17:48.520 --> 17:51.080
You're going to the cabaret?

17:51.120 --> 17:56.120
Yes, and as I said to Dwayne and Fidel,

17:51.120 --> 17:56.120
I feel like

17:56.160 --> 17:59.920
I need to integrate more, start acting more

17:56.160 --> 17:59.920
like a local.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.240
It's all in the hips.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.760
Please stop.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.880
Sorry, it's a, it's a work in progress.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.520
I assume you'll be there

18:16.440 --> 18:17.480
No. Ah.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.240
Camille, sir, we've had results back from the lab.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.240
Excellent, so what have we got?

18:40.280 --> 18:42.880
Well, they couldn't find any trace of poison in the glasses

18:40.280 --> 18:42.880
or the champagne.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.720
-One hundred percent.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.320
But Natasha was poisoned?

18:49.360 --> 18:52.240
Yes. It's a very rare poison. Bikh.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.280
Now, there was only a trace found

18:52.280 --> 18:54.280
in her system, but...

18:54.320 --> 18:56.800
-But a trace is all you need. -Exactly.

18:56.840 --> 19:02.160
Bikh is an organic, plant-based, clear liquid.

18:56.840 --> 19:02.160
It originates from Tibet.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.040
It is extremely fast-acting.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.720
Tibet? Oh, great! So, we've got a

19:04.080 --> 19:07.720
globe-trotting murderer.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.960
Fine. We've got a globe-trotting

19:07.760 --> 19:10.960
list of suspects. Yes, but if the poison

19:11.000 --> 19:14.200
wasn't in the champagne, how was it ingested?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.200
Mmm, that's a tricky one.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.160
Now, we know she shared the same bottle of wine

19:16.240 --> 19:19.160
with the others at the party,

19:19.200 --> 19:22.560
but there's no record of her having called room service

19:19.200 --> 19:22.560
when she got to her room.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.360
Yes, and the autopsy confirms that she didn't eat or drink

19:22.600 --> 19:26.360
anything after the champagne.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.120
We need to go back to that room

19:26.400 --> 19:29.120
and search it again.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.160
Dwayne, you do it. Maybe we've missed something,

19:29.160 --> 19:32.160
but, er...

19:32.200 --> 19:35.320
That poison must have been administered somehow.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.800
Maybe Adam Frost went back to her room?

19:37.840 --> 19:42.120
Or, or he could have set a trap for her.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.160
Because that's the thing about poison, isn't it?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.720
You don't have to be there when the person takes it.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.120
But if it was Adam, she let him in.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.200
So who stole the room key and why?

19:51.240 --> 19:55.800
Okay, so, we have got Adam Frost.

19:51.240 --> 19:55.800
He admits to visiting her,

19:55.840 --> 19:58.280
sharing a glass of champagne then leaving at 2:00 a.m.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.160
Paul Bevans and Max Leigh say they were in their rooms.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.160
Helen Walker was still en route from Los Angeles.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.640
Er, what about Simone?

20:06.680 --> 20:08.080
We know she was on duty.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.600
She has easy access to the keys,

20:09.640 --> 20:12.000
and can move around the hotel without being challenged.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.400
But what motive could she have?

20:13.440 --> 20:15.000
Well, right now, we haven't got a motive

20:13.440 --> 20:15.000
for any of them.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.160
Background checks?

20:17.200 --> 20:19.560
Paul Bevans lives north of London

20:17.200 --> 20:19.560
with his mother.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.840
He's been with the airline his entire career,

20:19.600 --> 20:23.840
seems pretty clean.

20:23.880 --> 20:27.600
Yes, and I called the airline, and they confirmed

20:23.880 --> 20:27.600
Natasha's promotion.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.120
But steward Max Leigh was also up for the same job,

20:27.640 --> 20:31.120
so maybe he was unhappy.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.760
Why?

20:32.800 --> 20:35.160
Max Leigh's been working for the airline twice

20:32.800 --> 20:35.160
as long as Natasha.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.080
So why didn't he get the promotion?

20:37.120 --> 20:41.000
Ah, some time ago the airline were doing

20:37.120 --> 20:41.000
a 360 degree staff review,

20:41.040 --> 20:43.480
whatever that is. Staff reports were assembled,

20:43.520 --> 20:45.480
and people were asked to appraise each other,

20:45.520 --> 20:48.040
you know, strengths, weaknesses and so on.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.280
This is the report for Max.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.960
And he doesn't come out of it well.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.480
"You're not focussed on the job, you're often late,

21:03.520 --> 21:06.320
"sometimes smelling of alcohol."

21:06.360 --> 21:10.840
Er, yeah, last night's alcohol.

21:06.360 --> 21:10.840
I was hungover, not drunk.

21:10.880 --> 21:14.240
Look, life is for living, right?

21:14.280 --> 21:19.640
And this job's hard enough, please and thank yous

21:14.280 --> 21:19.640
to a plane load of plebs,

21:19.680 --> 21:22.200
all moaning because they haven't been upgraded.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.920
At the end of a shift, I like to let my hair

21:22.240 --> 21:25.920
down a little bit.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.280
We all do. Well, most of us anyway.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.560
Is that a crime?

21:31.600 --> 21:34.280
Though, as we've heard, Natasha wasn't a party girl.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.560
Bet she disapproved.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.320
Well, yeah, she was Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.680
It's quite a large case for cabin crew, isn't it?

21:47.120 --> 21:51.640
Have you tried transporting a sharp suit in one of those

21:47.120 --> 21:51.640
little wheel

21:51.680 --> 21:54.480
Let me tell you. Nightmare.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.680
It was Tash who complained about me, wasn't it?

21:59.720 --> 22:01.400
What makes you think it was her?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.440
She hated me.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.360
Why?

22:06.400 --> 22:12.800
She was jealous! I'm young and out partying and she was,

22:06.400 --> 22:12.800
like, this old, tired woman.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.160
She was 35!

22:16.240 --> 22:18.080
Must've been very difficult for you.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.840
You do this job twice as long as Natasha

22:19.880 --> 22:21.360
and everyone's sure she'd get promotion.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.920
So didn't bother me.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.120
No?

22:26.160 --> 22:30.000
All that extra hassle and work for an extra,

22:26.160 --> 22:30.000
what, quid an hour?

22:30.040 --> 22:31.640
You can keep it.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.600
Look, it's just a job, okay?

22:33.640 --> 22:36.120
I wouldn't have killed her for it.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.360
If you're looking for a murder suspect,

22:40.400 --> 22:43.480
you're so looking in the wrong place.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.640
Where should we be looking?

22:46.600 --> 22:48.960
Paul Bevans.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.440
<i>We were getting</i> <i>on the crew coach to</i>

22:49.000 --> 22:51.440
<i>bring us to the hotel.</i>

22:51.480 --> 22:55.160
<i>Tash was in a right state</i> <i>about something,</i>

22:51.480 --> 22:55.160
<i>she was all over Paul.</i>

22:55.200 --> 22:56.840
<i>Having a right go at him,</i> <i>she was.</i>

22:56.880 --> 22:59.200
HUMPHREY: <i> What about?</i> MAX: <i> I don't know exactly.</i>

22:59.240 --> 23:00.440
I need it!

23:00.480 --> 23:02.880
Yeah! And you'll get it.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.680
Okay? As soon as we leave the island, I promise.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.960
And that's all I heard.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.520
Paul Bevans?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.880
No, I'm sorry, he went out just a little while ago.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.120
-He didn't say. I'm sorry.

23:39.360 --> 23:40.400
Thank you.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.800
The police have been here again.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.040
We need to talk. If Max heard correctly,

23:54.400 --> 23:56.000
Natasha was saying

23:56.040 --> 23:58.280
she "needed" something, not "wanted" something.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.680
"Needed" something from Paul Bevans.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.240
Money is the most obvious.

24:03.280 --> 24:07.960
There was a credit history report in his

24:03.280 --> 24:07.960
background check.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.320
Yes. Looks like most of his credit cards

24:08.000 --> 24:12.320
are maxed out.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.560
There are bank statements around here somewhere.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.040
Ah, ah!

24:21.880 --> 24:23.200
Ah! Here we are.

24:23.240 --> 24:27.400
You're right, money goes out as soon as it comes in.

24:27.440 --> 24:31.560
Hang on a second, there's a large deposit here,

24:27.440 --> 24:31.560
three months ago.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.880
Ten thousand euros.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.920
His salary?

24:34.960 --> 24:37.160
Oh, no, that went in as usual, the week before.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.400
Have you got Natasha's bank records?

24:40.440 --> 24:41.480
Yes, I have.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.480
Ha! There.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.680
Ten thousand euros?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.240
Yes.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.920
Why is he so much in debt?

24:51.960 --> 24:54.240
It might be something to do with his lifestyle.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.120
<i>He wears an elastic band</i> <i>around his wrist.</i>

24:56.160 --> 24:58.400
<i>It's a classic</i> <i>addicts' device.</i>

24:58.440 --> 25:00.640
They ping it whenever they get a craving

25:00.680 --> 25:02.200
to remind them they're trying to quit.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.120
He's an addict?

25:04.160 --> 25:07.040
Yeah. And, as the airlines take regular blood tests,

25:07.080 --> 25:10.360
it must be something other than excessive drink or drugs.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.400
-That's my bet.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.520
If I wanted to play cards for money, where would I go?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.640
Somewhere dirtier than a casino,

25:22.680 --> 25:24.880
but somewhere where a lack of credit

25:22.680 --> 25:24.880
wouldn't be an issue?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.920
We hear you've been having some financial difficulties.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.080
Not anymore.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.080
We've seen your accounts, credit card bills, loans...

26:09.120 --> 26:10.960
Yeah, okay. I know that might not look great,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.640
but I've just been moving things around a little bit,

26:13.680 --> 26:15.400
you know, robbing Peter to pay Paul.

26:17.960 --> 26:18.960
Paul?

26:21.440 --> 26:24.480
We're not here to talk about your credit cards.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.240
Natasha loaned you some money, a lot of money.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.800
Yeah, it was an emergency.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.040
What emergency?

26:49.160 --> 26:52.280
Well, I'd had a bit of a run of bad luck

26:49.160 --> 26:52.280
in Macau and, erm,

26:52.320 --> 26:55.280
I was having a bit of trouble paying

26:52.320 --> 26:55.280
some guys off over there.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.440
They wanted their money?

26:58.000 --> 27:01.480
These guys, they break bones.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.120
I wouldn't have been able to work, my debts

27:01.520 --> 27:04.120
would've mounted up,

27:04.160 --> 27:06.080
and it would have been the end of everything.

27:06.120 --> 27:12.760
Tash stepped in, paid my debt off

27:06.120 --> 27:12.760
and saved my life.

27:12.800 --> 27:16.560
We believe that when you arrived in Saint-Marie

27:12.800 --> 27:16.560
she asked for it back?

27:17.880 --> 27:19.480
Yeah, that's right. She said she needed it.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.760
Must have put you under a bit of pressure?

27:21.800 --> 27:24.680
Yeah, and I didn't need her to make me

27:21.800 --> 27:24.680
feel pressurised.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.600
I was feeling that pressure already.

27:28.400 --> 27:32.400
I felt so guilty. I was just desperate to pay

27:28.400 --> 27:32.400
her back, you know.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.840
And, like I promised her, I would have.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.720
So, we have no clear suspect and no clear motive.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.080
But those two things are currently the least

27:46.760 --> 27:49.080
of our problems

27:49.120 --> 27:52.040
because, despite forensics and the pathologist's report,

27:52.080 --> 27:54.880
we still have no idea how the poison was administered.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.080
It's not exactly going very well, is it?

28:00.120 --> 28:04.440
Right. So, the last person we believe to have

28:00.120 --> 28:04.440
seen Natasha,

28:04.480 --> 28:06.560
they each drank a glass of champagne

28:06.600 --> 28:10.400
before he, Adam Frost, returned to his room

28:06.600 --> 28:10.400
shortly after 2:00.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.560
And he lied at first.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.960
<i>He didn't tell us</i> <i>about visiting Natasha.</i>

28:16.000 --> 28:19.040
Because he knew how it would look to Helen.

28:19.080 --> 28:22.640
Although he doesn't appear to have any reason

28:19.080 --> 28:22.640
at all to kill Natasha.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.680
Next we have First Officer Paul Bevans.

28:25.720 --> 28:29.280
Under pressure to repay a 10,000 euro debt to Natasha.

28:29.320 --> 28:32.920
-Boy, that's a lot of money. -Although he has the money

28:29.320 --> 28:32.920
to pay her back.

28:32.960 --> 28:37.040
He did today. Yesterday may have been

28:32.960 --> 28:37.040
a completely different matter.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.640
Though I have to say, he did seem grateful

28:37.080 --> 28:39.640
for her help.

28:39.680 --> 28:44.400
<i>Tash stepped in,</i> <i>paid my debt off</i>

28:39.680 --> 28:44.400
<i>and saved my life.</i>

28:48.800 --> 28:52.200
He doesn't sound like a man who hated the victim

28:48.800 --> 28:52.200
enough to take her life.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.840
Max, on the other hand, clearly had little time

28:52.240 --> 28:54.840
for Natasha,

28:54.880 --> 28:56.600
thought she was a goody two-shoes

28:56.640 --> 28:58.520
and that she had spoken ill of him to the airline.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.240
Motive enough for murder?

29:00.280 --> 29:02.040
Professional jealousy?

29:02.080 --> 29:04.240
The senior steward promotion, everyone thought it would

29:02.080 --> 29:04.240
go to Natasha.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.480
And they were right.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.680
But he says he didn't want the promotion.

29:07.720 --> 29:13.040
<i>All that extra hassle and work</i> <i>for an extra quid an hour,</i>

29:07.720 --> 29:13.040
<i>you can keep it.</i>

29:13.080 --> 29:14.800
HUMPHREY: <i>If he is to be believed.</i>

29:16.320 --> 29:17.960
Unless there's something else we don't know,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.320
it doesn't feel like a strong enough motive.

29:20.360 --> 29:23.240
And yet he is the suspect who least liked Natasha.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.360
Which brings us to the lovely Simone Magon.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.400
What?

29:27.880 --> 29:29.560
Go on.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.840
She had the opportunity, she could have easily taken

29:29.600 --> 29:32.840
the second key

29:32.880 --> 29:34.840
to gain access to the room.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.760
Yes, but, Dwayne, wouldn't she have put it back afterwards?

29:34.880 --> 29:37.760
It's still missing.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.600
Yeah, I'm not convinced she's linked.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.760
Me neither.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.640
But I heard her on the phone earlier.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.000
<i>The police have been</i> <i>here again. We need to talk.</i>

29:46.040 --> 29:49.680
I still can't see a link between her and the victim.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.680
Yes, but if I dig around a bit I might find one.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.560
No, Camille's right. I appreciate your thoughts,

29:52.720 --> 29:55.560
Dwayne.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.400
We won't dismiss her, but there's really not enough

29:55.600 --> 29:58.400
to make her a suspect.

29:58.800 --> 29:59.800
Great.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.920
Okay, it's late. Let's come at it again

30:01.800 --> 30:05.920
fresh in the morning.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.760
Yes, you're probably right.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.800
Attack it again in the morning with clear minds.

30:09.840 --> 30:14.200
And you don't want to miss the Tropical

30:09.840 --> 30:14.200
Caribbean Cabaret.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.040
I'm sorry. What?

30:17.080 --> 30:21.240
The inspector wants to see the real Saint-Marie.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.800
Well, he's not going to find it at the Tropical Caribbean

30:21.280 --> 30:24.800
Cabaret! A lie, Fidel?

30:24.840 --> 30:27.120
A true. It's only for the tourists, sir.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.960
Even I think it's cheap and tacky!

30:31.560 --> 30:33.240
You were going to tell me, right?

30:33.960 --> 30:35.560
Of course!

30:35.600 --> 30:36.760
DWAYNE: We can't let you do it, Chief.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.680
Okay, do you want to see the real

30:38.400 --> 30:40.680
Saint

30:40.720 --> 30:42.160
Yes.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.360
I love it!

30:49.400 --> 30:51.640
He'll be dancing any minute now.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.400
I should have a little food first.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.800
What do you recommend?

30:56.840 --> 31:00.120
The most authentic, traditional, island dish.

31:00.160 --> 31:01.480
Yes, please!

31:01.520 --> 31:04.640
-Hotter the better!

31:04.680 --> 31:08.400
Ah, so you won't need that. I'll get you

31:04.680 --> 31:08.400
the staff special.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.560
It's a shame the boys couldn't join us.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.400
Fidel had some family stuff he couldn't get out of.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.320
And Dwayne?

31:16.360 --> 31:18.720
He said he wanted to catch up on some work.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.200
Yeah, I know!

31:56.200 --> 31:58.520
-Oh! -Ah!

31:58.560 --> 32:00.080
Here we are.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.760
Is that what I think it is?

32:01.800 --> 32:04.600
Mmm. Saint-Marie <i> confit de poulet</i> .

32:04.640 --> 32:07.040
Con... -Chicken stew.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.960
Ah!

32:10.000 --> 32:13.520
-My mother's speciality. -It looks fantastic!

32:10.000 --> 32:13.520
Thank you.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.760
You're so welcome. I'll get you some bowls.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.360
Thank you.

32:18.920 --> 32:19.920
Er...

32:27.520 --> 32:28.720
Oh...

32:49.280 --> 32:50.320
Oh.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.880
Mmm, it's magnificent.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.000
Yes.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.240
Mmm, the flavours and spices.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.120
-No, it's perfect.

33:01.160 --> 33:02.160
Okay.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.680
What's in it?

33:05.720 --> 33:08.960
Erm, garlic, ginger, chilli,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.680
and there's a Bondamanjak in there too.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.440
Bon-bonda...

33:14.880 --> 33:16.440
Bo

33:16.480 --> 33:20.320
Yeah, it's like a Scotch Bonnet chilli

33:16.480 --> 33:20.320
as a flavour thing.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.760
But the trick is you have to keep that whole.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.520
If it bursts, it's too hot and it just ruins the dish.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.960
-Mmm, tomato. -No, no, no, don't...

33:29.000 --> 33:31.440
Oh, my! That's the chilli.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.280
The Scotch Bonnet chilli, you've just had the...

33:34.320 --> 33:37.040
-It's okay.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.520
Ah.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.160
<i>Maman?</i>

33:47.200 --> 33:48.760
<i>Maman!</i>

33:48.800 --> 33:50.440
<i>Maman!</i>

33:50.480 --> 33:51.640
<i>Maman?</i>

33:53.760 --> 33:54.840
<i>Maman?</i>

34:07.440 --> 34:09.160
You find anything?

34:25.920 --> 34:27.760
Drink another.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.520
Do you think I should call an ambulance?

34:29.560 --> 34:31.400
He should be okay if he keeps drinking milk.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.440
Again. Drink.

35:10.080 --> 35:13.040
-Morning. -Ah, another shirt.

35:13.080 --> 35:17.880
Yes. I couldn't really wear last night's with everything.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.560
-Better, thank you.

35:20.600 --> 35:24.200
My mother was very worried, I mean, we all were.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.080
Yes, I think I owe your mother for a lot of milk.

35:27.120 --> 35:30.480
-Don't worry about that. -But, Fidel, you

35:27.120 --> 35:30.480
should see her car.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.240
I don't care about her car! You shouldn't have been there!

35:32.280 --> 35:33.920
What's going on?

35:33.960 --> 35:36.360
Simone Magon's lodged an official

35:33.960 --> 35:36.360
complaint against Dwayne.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.680
-Police harassment. -Dwayne, I thought we agreed.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.560
I know, Chief, but I was following a lead.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.960
What lead?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.360
Well, when I say "lead", I mean "hunch".

35:46.400 --> 35:48.520
Dwayne, listen to me and listen to me good.

35:48.560 --> 35:52.040
You stay away from her from now on, you understand?

35:48.560 --> 35:52.040
That's an order.

35:52.080 --> 35:56.040
You messed up.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.480
You need to go and apologise to her,

35:57.520 --> 35:59.080
tell her we were acting on bad information,

35:59.120 --> 36:01.640
-and hopefully she'll retract her complaint.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.640
-She won't!

36:01.680 --> 36:04.240
-You don't know what she's like!

36:01.680 --> 36:04.240
-Dwayne! Apologise.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.200
All right, I'll apologise.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.160
Now? -Yes, now.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.680
Come on, I'll go with you.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.520
-Yes, let's.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.120
The answer must be in here somewhere.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.640
She was poisoned, but there was no

36:29.160 --> 36:32.640
poison in the room.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.520
It wasn't in the glass or the champagne.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.960
Yet no one forced her to take the poison. There

36:34.560 --> 36:36.960
were no cuts, no bruises.

36:39.640 --> 36:40.680
What are you looking...

36:42.480 --> 36:43.880
Ah, the timeline! Right.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.280
We know that Natasha was last seen alive

36:48.040 --> 36:50.280
at midnight

36:50.320 --> 36:51.960
-when she left the others. -Mmm-hmm.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.680
She dies at 2:30. So between those times

36:55.720 --> 36:58.480
we believe that she returned to her room

36:55.720 --> 36:58.480
after leaving the others.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.360
And we also knew that she returned to her room

37:00.400 --> 37:04.840
because Natasha wrote that it was 1:00 a.m. in one

37:00.400 --> 37:04.840
of the postcards.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.320
What else did she write in that postcard?

37:06.360 --> 37:08.520
Er, that she had some exciting news.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.360
Which we assume was her promotion.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.680
But she can't have written about the promotion

37:12.400 --> 37:15.680
in the postcard...

37:15.720 --> 37:18.280
Because according to Adam Frost,

37:15.720 --> 37:18.280
she didn't know by then.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.640
Until he arrived half an hour later.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.920
So we need to call our contact at the airline,

37:22.960 --> 37:25.680
find out who knew about the promotion and when.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.120
You've felt really distant since I got here.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.120
Sorry, it's just such a shock.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.560
I know. Poor Tash.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.200
That's it though, isn't it

37:41.680 --> 37:42.720
Hmm?

37:44.440 --> 37:46.160
You still love me?

37:47.600 --> 37:50.400
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.800
No, no, that's all. Thank you. Bye.

38:00.480 --> 38:04.280
The decision was made in London in the early evening

38:00.480 --> 38:04.280
on the day of the murder.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.240
Because of the time difference,

38:06.280 --> 38:10.080
her line manager decided not to contact Natasha

38:06.280 --> 38:10.080
until the following morning.

38:10.120 --> 38:13.080
When she couldn't reach Natasha direct, she

38:10.120 --> 38:13.080
spoke to Adam Frost.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.160
So Adam couldn't have known about it

38:13.120 --> 38:16.160
the night before.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.280
So, the question has to be,

38:19.320 --> 38:21.800
if he was less than truthful about his reasons for visiting

38:21.840 --> 38:24.320
Natasha in the early hours of the morning,

38:24.360 --> 38:28.040
why else would he be visiting her at 1:30 a.m. and

38:24.360 --> 38:28.040
drinking champagne?

38:28.680 --> 38:30.080
Why do you think?

38:34.440 --> 38:37.360
It's a little early for that, isn't it?

38:37.400 --> 38:40.400
Is it my drinking you'd like to discuss or is there

38:37.400 --> 38:40.400
something else?

38:40.440 --> 38:41.760
Perhaps you'd feel more comfortable

38:41.800 --> 38:44.680
having this conversation down at the station?

38:44.720 --> 38:46.280
Adam and I don't have secrets.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.280
HUMPHREY: It's about Natasha.

38:51.320 --> 38:55.280
You didn't go to Natasha's room to tell her about

38:51.320 --> 38:55.280
the promotion.

38:55.320 --> 38:58.200
So the big question is,

38:58.240 --> 39:00.560
why did you go to her room to share

38:58.240 --> 39:00.560
a bottle of champagne?

39:02.560 --> 39:04.760
It's all perfectly innocent.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.760
Adam, listen to me, what you say now,

39:07.000 --> 39:10.760
this is really serious.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.640
This is a murder enquiry.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.040
Baby?

39:23.800 --> 39:24.840
I'm sorry.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.960
You and Natasha?

39:29.000 --> 39:32.280
I tried to end it, I swear I did,

39:29.000 --> 39:32.280
but I loved her.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.640
I'm so sorry.

39:35.680 --> 39:38.160
You were carrying on behind my back,

39:35.680 --> 39:38.160
making me look stupid,

39:38.200 --> 39:40.080
-laughing at me! -No!

39:40.120 --> 39:43.320
No, I swear that wasn't the case.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.840
Yeah, it bloody matters!

39:47.800 --> 39:48.840
Six months.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.040
Bloody cabin crew!

39:54.080 --> 39:55.480
Always at it!

40:07.960 --> 40:10.560
I suppose people have got over worse,

40:13.640 --> 40:16.040
people who have got less than us.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.600
If you want to try?

40:21.160 --> 40:23.600
I loved her because I didn't love you any more.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.760
I'm sorry.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.560
At least I don't have anything to hide any more.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.560
I can be honest.

40:49.280 --> 40:53.040
Natasha and I, we decided to make a go of it.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.360
<i>That was the real reason</i> <i>we were celebrating.</i>

40:55.400 --> 40:57.720
<i></i> <i>-New beginnings.</i>

41:00.320 --> 41:03.560
We'd put in an offer on a house in Provence.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.240
It was Tash's dream.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.840
The bank, the estate agents, our solicitors...

41:09.880 --> 41:11.640
I'll give you their details. They'll confirm everything.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.560
I loved her.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.880
-Because he's a pilot. -What's that got

41:22.040 --> 41:24.880
to do with it?

41:24.920 --> 41:28.160
Pilots are level-headed, considered. They plan things.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.680
-They're very precise. -You just described

41:28.200 --> 41:31.680
the murderer.

41:40.360 --> 41:44.760
Maybe Natasha spurned him. She wasn't interested, she

41:40.360 --> 41:44.760
wanted to end it, who knows?

41:44.800 --> 41:46.440
We only have Adam's word they were in love.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.280
Even though they were buying a farm together?

41:48.320 --> 41:50.400
Again, we only have his word.

41:50.440 --> 41:52.320
Even if his lawyer confirmed the purchase,

41:52.360 --> 41:56.520
she may have still tried to end it. Maybe she decided

41:52.360 --> 41:56.520
to buy it on her own.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.000
Could she afford to do that?

41:58.040 --> 42:00.240
Might explain why she was asking Paul to repay his loan.

42:00.280 --> 42:01.960
Excuse me.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.280
But I think we may owe Dwayne an apology.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.480
Simone Magon's phone records.

42:10.520 --> 42:14.360
Dwayne requested them at the start of the investigation.

42:10.520 --> 42:14.360
Look here.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.160
UK mobile number.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.880
Yep. And here and here and here. All to the same

42:16.200 --> 42:19.880
mobile number.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.320
-Max Leigh.

42:23.480 --> 42:25.120
Max and Simone?

42:25.160 --> 42:26.360
Even though...

42:27.720 --> 42:29.840
<i>I don't know any</i> <i>of them, really.</i>

42:29.880 --> 42:32.920
<i>They tend to keep themselves</i> <i>to themselves.</i>

42:32.960 --> 42:36.400
HUMPHREY: <i> So, that's why</i> <i>I saw them together.</i>

42:36.440 --> 42:39.240
Why would Simone choose not to tell us she knows Max?

42:39.280 --> 42:41.680
She's hiding something. As is Max.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.440
Remember how quickly he turned the spotlight

42:41.720 --> 42:44.440
onto Paul.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.920
If you're looking for a murder suspect,

42:46.960 --> 42:49.040
you are so looking in the wrong place.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.240
But what links them?

42:53.560 --> 42:55.200
I've been telling you.

42:55.240 --> 42:59.080
It's the only thing Simone and her family

42:55.240 --> 42:59.080
are interested in.

42:59.120 --> 43:02.680
And how would a small-time criminal make money

42:59.120 --> 43:02.680
from an air steward

43:02.720 --> 43:04.400
flying in and out of the country?

43:04.440 --> 43:07.520
-Smuggling.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.280
Finally looks like we're getting somewhere

43:07.560 --> 43:10.280
with the case.

43:13.520 --> 43:14.560
Of course. Of course.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.560
<i>Max,</i>

43:22.000 --> 43:23.400
<i>and Simone.</i> <i>The same...</i>

43:27.080 --> 43:28.120
The case.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.480
What now?

43:29.520 --> 43:32.080
You wouldn't mind us looking in your case,

43:29.520 --> 43:32.080
would you?

43:32.120 --> 43:34.120
Help yourself.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.560
CAMILLE: Drugs

43:38.280 --> 43:39.520
Nothing.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.320
You already delivered, didn't you?

43:44.360 --> 43:45.640
Where will we find Simone?

43:45.680 --> 43:47.000
I know. Come on.

43:48.520 --> 43:49.640
You stay with him.

43:56.920 --> 43:58.360
There she is!

44:11.400 --> 44:12.920
Drugs

44:14.840 --> 44:17.280
-Duty free.

44:19.200 --> 44:22.280
Cigarettes, perfume, spirits. Max brought them

44:19.200 --> 44:22.280
in on his flights,

44:22.320 --> 44:25.040
Simone sold them to local bars and shops.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.960
I told you she was no good.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.200
It doesn't feel like a big enough motive for murder,

44:27.000 --> 44:30.200
though, does it?

44:30.240 --> 44:34.040
It's big enough for Max. If Natasha found out,

44:30.240 --> 44:34.040
it's the end of his career.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.640
-Hmm. -And Simone could lose

44:34.080 --> 44:36.640
her job at the hotel.

44:38.760 --> 44:43.560
Yes, but Simone could have slipped the poison to Natasha

44:38.760 --> 44:43.560
at any time, as could Max.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.640
Why was she killed on her own, in her room?

44:46.680 --> 44:48.680
And how was the poison administered?

44:48.720 --> 44:51.240
And why did the killer take the second key?

44:56.320 --> 44:59.000
She came back to her room, seemingly well.

44:59.040 --> 45:02.160
She wrote postcards to her family.

44:59.040 --> 45:02.160
Adam Frost came.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.920
She and Adam drank champagne. He left. She didn't.

45:05.960 --> 45:08.360
What did she do in that last half

45:08.400 --> 45:10.240
We know she didn't eat or drink anything.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.960
Yet she was poisoned. It makes no sense.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.600
She finished packing.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.200
And she was found here.

45:24.960 --> 45:27.200
What did she see?

45:27.240 --> 45:29.600
What was the last thing she saw?

45:38.560 --> 45:39.560
Gloves!

46:01.560 --> 46:03.320
That is our poison.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.280
Let's see if Fidel can get a print off it.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.120
I don't understand how we missed it.

46:14.160 --> 46:17.760
We searched every spot in that room, twice.

46:17.800 --> 46:20.760
-I know I did. -It doesn't make any sense.

46:20.800 --> 46:22.920
How can something just suddenly

46:20.800 --> 46:22.920
turn up like that?

46:26.320 --> 46:27.360
We got a match.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.240
Adam Frost?

46:32.600 --> 46:33.680
Yes.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.440
Yes, just as I thought.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.400
Well, let's go and pick him up.

46:40.440 --> 46:44.920
But it still doesn't tell us how the poison

46:40.440 --> 46:44.920
was administered.

46:45.760 --> 46:47.840
Maybe Adam will tell us.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.080
Hang on a sec.

46:50.960 --> 46:52.480
There's something in here. Look.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.160
Looks like a hair.

47:00.200 --> 47:02.680
We can send it to the lab, get a DNA check.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.200
HUMPHREY: It doesn't look like a human hair.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.680
It's an animal?

47:09.720 --> 47:11.320
Wait a minute.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.040
CAMILLE: Erm...

47:15.840 --> 47:17.040
Animal?

47:22.520 --> 47:26.720
<i>I think I heard it was</i> <i>her first time at the hotel,</i>

47:22.520 --> 47:26.720
<i>her first time on the island.</i>

47:28.440 --> 47:31.840
<i></i> <i>-New beginnings.</i>

47:31.880 --> 47:34.080
<i>That's just the gossipy world</i> <i>of biccy-chuckers.</i>

47:34.520 --> 47:35.560
Ah!

47:44.520 --> 47:45.640
It's a goat hair!

47:46.840 --> 47:47.840
Sorry?

47:49.200 --> 47:51.960
The hair in the bottle belongs to a goat.

47:53.520 --> 47:54.960
Makes sense.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.160
No!

48:03.720 --> 48:05.520
Oh, you are a genius.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.880
Our murderer's a genius.

48:11.920 --> 48:14.520
An absolute, bloomin' genius!

48:14.560 --> 48:17.560
Right, let's get everyone together at the hotel!

48:29.920 --> 48:31.440
Thank you all for coming.

48:31.480 --> 48:34.280
Like we all had a choice.

48:34.320 --> 48:37.840
Natasha Thiebert died from poisoning,

48:34.320 --> 48:37.840
this much we know.

48:37.880 --> 48:40.400
She was murdered.

48:40.440 --> 48:44.400
The things that eluded us, until a short while ago,

48:40.440 --> 48:44.400
anyway,

48:44.440 --> 48:46.600
were not just the "who",

48:46.640 --> 48:48.440
but also the "how",

48:48.480 --> 48:50.480
and "why".

48:50.520 --> 48:52.160
It's a bit of a mess, actually.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.280
First, we must look at motive.

48:55.320 --> 48:58.080
Who here had the motive?

48:58.120 --> 49:02.000
Max was stealing duty free stock

48:58.120 --> 49:02.000
from the airline.

49:02.040 --> 49:06.520
Simone was selling those goods on to local bars

49:02.040 --> 49:06.520
and shops.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.000
And?

49:08.040 --> 49:11.320
Both stood to lose their jobs, if discovered.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.160
We know that Max already suspected

49:11.360 --> 49:14.160
Natasha of reporting him

49:14.200 --> 49:16.880
to the airline for other misdemeanours.

49:16.920 --> 49:19.760
And then we have First Officer Paul Bevans,

49:19.800 --> 49:22.920
a gambler, who owed Natasha money.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.400
I had it yesterday. I could have paid it all back.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.760
But not today?

49:28.080 --> 49:29.120
Or the day before.

49:30.720 --> 49:32.960
Adam Frost's motive may well have been different.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.400
He was in love with her. They were having an affair.

49:36.440 --> 49:37.600
PAUL: What?

49:38.400 --> 49:39.400
Did you know?

49:43.360 --> 49:45.360
I wouldn't have killed her. I loved her.

49:47.080 --> 49:48.280
You say you loved her, but did she love you?

49:48.320 --> 49:50.600
We only have your word for that.

49:51.800 --> 49:54.440
And, finally, there's Helen.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.480
Me?

49:56.520 --> 49:59.320
As the truth of Adam and Natasha's affair

49:56.520 --> 49:59.320
was revealed,

49:59.360 --> 50:01.560
it gave you the clearest motive of all.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.360
To get rid of a love rival.

50:05.520 --> 50:09.080
-I only found out about the affair yesterday.

50:05.520 --> 50:09.080
-So you say.

50:09.120 --> 50:14.040
But then, as we know, the cabin crew world is

50:09.120 --> 50:14.040
a gossipy little world.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.080
You can think what you like. I wasn't even here.

50:17.120 --> 50:20.240
No, you're absolutely right. You were on a flight en route

50:20.280 --> 50:22.360
to Saint-Marie when the murder took place.

50:25.600 --> 50:29.000
Which brings us rather neatly on to opportunity.

50:29.040 --> 50:31.600
Who had the opportunity?

50:31.640 --> 50:34.760
The spare key to Natasha's room went missing.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.080
Now, any one of you could have stolen it from reception.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.960
Except me.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.240
But that, but that doesn't tell us how the poison

50:39.000 --> 50:43.240
was administered.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.000
You see, when we searched that room,

50:46.040 --> 50:48.320
we couldn't find anything containing the poison.

50:48.360 --> 50:52.120
And yet, today, strangely enough, we did.

50:52.160 --> 50:57.840
Today, we found a bottle with Adam's

50:52.160 --> 50:57.840
fingerprints all over it.

50:57.880 --> 51:01.720
Hotel shampoos. I've thrown away

50:57.880 --> 51:01.720
hundreds all over the world.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.960
I'm sure you have, but this one

51:01.760 --> 51:03.960
is quite different.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.600
How?

51:06.640 --> 51:08.760
Because this one contains the poison used to murder

51:06.640 --> 51:08.760
Natasha Thiebert.

51:14.280 --> 51:17.120
So, how did we not find this sooner?

51:17.160 --> 51:18.880
Incompetence by our forensic team?

51:20.200 --> 51:21.840
Or just an oversight?

51:21.880 --> 51:23.600
Frankly, I don't believe the first for a second,

51:25.080 --> 51:29.240
and the second is pretty unlikely.

51:29.280 --> 51:33.080
So, if we didn't miss it, then it had to have been

51:29.280 --> 51:33.080
planted by someone much later.

51:35.160 --> 51:39.080
Planted by someone who wanted to frame Adam Frost...

51:39.120 --> 51:42.840
Using the missing key, once again, in order to do so.

51:43.360 --> 51:46.200
Once again, yes.

51:46.240 --> 51:49.840
You see, the key was taken before, but it wasn't used

51:46.240 --> 51:49.840
to murder Natasha.

51:53.280 --> 51:58.080
But taken so there was an independent eye-witness

51:53.280 --> 51:58.080
to the discovery of the body.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.720
Isn't that right,

52:01.160 --> 52:02.160
Helen?

52:10.120 --> 52:11.160
Me?

52:13.000 --> 52:16.040
How could I have killed her when I wasn't even here?

52:18.840 --> 52:22.000
And that is what is absolutely brilliant

52:18.840 --> 52:22.000
about this.

52:22.040 --> 52:27.040
Your cast-iron alibi. But as Sergeant Best

52:22.040 --> 52:27.040
pointed out...

52:27.080 --> 52:29.440
<i>That's the thing</i> <i>about poison, isn't it?</i>

52:29.480 --> 52:31.480
<i>You don't have to be there</i> <i>when the person takes it.</i>

52:33.760 --> 52:35.000
I don't have to listen to this.

52:35.040 --> 52:36.320
Oh, yes, you do.

52:36.920 --> 52:37.960
Sit.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.840
Helen, please,

52:43.720 --> 52:46.280
don't hide your genius.

52:46.320 --> 52:53.360
What you did, awful as it was, was also bloody brilliant.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.720
Aside from the key. You really should have put that back,

52:53.400 --> 52:56.720
shouldn't you?

52:56.760 --> 52:59.920
But then, if you had, you wouldn't have made

52:56.760 --> 52:59.920
your biggest mistake.

53:02.240 --> 53:05.240
Adam declared his love for Natasha.

53:05.280 --> 53:07.200
<i>I suppose people</i> <i>have got over worse,</i>

53:08.320 --> 53:09.840
<i>people with less than us.</i>

53:11.240 --> 53:13.880
<i>If you want to try?</i>

53:13.920 --> 53:17.040
If Adam had accepted your olive branch at

53:13.920 --> 53:17.040
that very moment,

53:17.080 --> 53:19.120
you may well have got away with this murder.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.960
But he didn't, did he?

53:23.000 --> 53:26.440
<i>I was with Tash</i> <i>because I didn't want to</i>

53:23.000 --> 53:26.440
<i>be with you any more.</i>

53:26.480 --> 53:29.320
<i>I loved her because</i> <i>I didn't love you. I'm sorry.</i>

53:29.360 --> 53:33.880
HUMPHREY: <i> And at that very</i> <i>moment, you hatched</i>

53:29.360 --> 53:33.880
<i>a new plan, didn't you?</i>

53:33.920 --> 53:36.840
To frame Adam for the murder you committed.

53:40.280 --> 53:43.000
<i>Using the missing key,</i> <i>you let yourself in.</i>

53:43.040 --> 53:44.840
<i>You'd already stolen</i> <i>a bottle from Adam's room,</i>

53:44.880 --> 53:46.440
<i>knowing it would have</i> <i>his fingerprints on it.</i>

53:46.480 --> 53:49.240
<i>You emptied it,</i> <i>cleaned it and</i>

53:46.480 --> 53:49.240
<i>put the poison in.</i>

53:49.280 --> 53:54.120
You knew that when it was eventually found,

53:49.280 --> 53:54.120
it would implicate him.

53:54.160 --> 53:57.800
Yeah, this is all very clever, but it doesn't

53:54.160 --> 53:57.800
explain how I killed her

53:57.840 --> 54:01.200
when I was 38,000 feet in the sky.

54:01.240 --> 54:04.520
Ah, yes, good point. It's a very good point.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.920
And that's how using the bottle to frame Adam

54:04.560 --> 54:07.920
was your downfall.

54:07.960 --> 54:11.920
Because the clue to how you did it was a hair

54:07.960 --> 54:11.920
in this bottle of poison.

54:14.520 --> 54:15.560
Animal hair.

54:18.400 --> 54:22.560
<i>See, Natasha was well-known</i> <i>for writing postcards home</i>

54:18.400 --> 54:22.560
<i>from wherever she landed.</i>

54:22.600 --> 54:23.960
You'd shared a room with her often enough

54:24.000 --> 54:26.760
to know her routine and, shortly after Adam left,

54:26.800 --> 54:29.040
having packed her case and got everything

54:26.800 --> 54:29.040
ready to leave in the morning

54:29.080 --> 54:32.760
and, yes, while you were 38,000 feet

54:29.080 --> 54:32.760
up in the sky,

54:32.800 --> 54:34.920
you murdered Natasha Thiebert!

54:40.600 --> 54:42.600
<i>Helen.</i>

54:42.640 --> 54:48.040
<i>You bought the poison in Tibet</i> <i>and, using a make-up brush,</i>

54:48.080 --> 54:50.040
<i>a make-up brush,</i> <i>made from goat hair...</i>

54:50.080 --> 54:52.400
<i>As I discovered,</i> <i>the best ones generally are.</i>

54:52.440 --> 54:55.240
<i>...you coated the</i> <i>Saint-Marie stamps,</i>

54:58.120 --> 54:59.960
<i>before passing them</i> <i>on to Natasha,</i>

55:00.000 --> 55:01.720
<i>knowing she was about</i> <i>to fly to Saint-Marie</i>

55:00.000 --> 55:01.720
<i>for the first time,</i>

55:01.760 --> 55:06.640
<i>to put in her lucky-dip bag,</i> <i>to use to send</i>

55:01.760 --> 55:06.640
<i>a postcard home.</i>

55:09.840 --> 55:12.640
After discovering the affair, you coated the stamps,

55:12.680 --> 55:15.440
in order to murder your love rival

55:15.480 --> 55:21.280
and to ensure you had a brilliant, cast-iron alibi.

55:21.320 --> 55:27.640
After all, as you pointed out, how could you possibly

55:21.320 --> 55:27.640
kill anyone from 38,000 feet?

55:28.720 --> 55:31.640
You can't prove any of this.

55:31.680 --> 55:33.600
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.

55:33.640 --> 55:37.600
You see, I reckon that tiny little goat hair,

55:33.640 --> 55:37.600
with your DNA all over it,

55:40.120 --> 55:42.920
is probably all the proof I'd need.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.160
Take her away.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.720
Is the fat lady singing?

55:52.760 --> 55:54.000
Oh, yes!

56:02.440 --> 56:04.080
So it was all about love and jealousy, huh?

56:04.120 --> 56:06.240
Love makes the world go around.

56:06.280 --> 56:08.600
-Mmm. -And jealousy

56:06.280 --> 56:08.600
makes it stop.

56:09.600 --> 56:12.720
Anyway, well done, everyone.

56:12.760 --> 56:14.240
A job well done, I think.

56:14.280 --> 56:16.800
DWAYNE: Cheers.

56:16.840 --> 56:20.080
I still think we should have arrested that Simone,

56:16.840 --> 56:20.080
though, you know.

56:20.120 --> 56:21.840
A few cigarettes never hurt anybody.

56:23.680 --> 56:27.400
I suppose that's not strictly true,

56:23.680 --> 56:27.400
but you get my gist.

56:27.440 --> 56:30.840
No, if I'm going to, er, blend in with the locals more,

56:30.880 --> 56:33.600
be at one with Saint-Marie, then, I suppose, locking up

56:33.640 --> 56:36.280
half the shop and bar owners wouldn't really help,

56:33.640 --> 56:36.280
would it?

56:36.800 --> 56:37.840
Hmm.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.520
I suppose not.

56:40.560 --> 56:43.000
So, you're still keen to blend in?

56:43.480 --> 56:45.000
Absolutely.

56:45.040 --> 56:48.040
Although, as much as we all loved

56:45.040 --> 56:48.040
your new shirts,

56:48.080 --> 56:50.680
it's nice to see you back in your usual attire.

56:50.720 --> 56:52.400
Very true, Fidel. You can blend in,

56:52.440 --> 56:55.200
but you don't have to change your personality.

56:55.240 --> 56:56.240
Or your shirt. Amen.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.800
Which is exactly why I'm going to leave

57:03.200 --> 57:05.800
the colourful shirts

57:05.840 --> 57:06.840
to the locals.

57:08.800 --> 57:09.840
Like you.

57:12.400 --> 57:16.920
And as you like them so much, I look forward to seeing

57:12.400 --> 57:16.920
you wearing them.

57:16.960 --> 57:19.040
DWAYNE: Me?

57:19.080 --> 57:22.240
Yeah, I don't think that will work, sir.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.760
Chief, I don't think I could, erm, pull off that look!

57:24.800 --> 57:25.840
Me, neither. Of course you can.

57:27.920 --> 57:28.960
I don't... I insist.

58:07.080 --> 58:09.400
Dad!

58:09.440 --> 58:11.440
The day a government minister's exposed

58:09.440 --> 58:11.440
as having an affair...

58:11.480 --> 58:13.400
He takes his own life.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.760
I don't think this is a suicide. It's just been

58:13.440 --> 58:15.760
staged to look like one.

58:15.800 --> 58:18.320
If you ask me, this is murder.

58:18.360 --> 58:22.640
I want to see who did this behind bars for

58:18.360 --> 58:22.640
a very long time.

58:26.080 --> 58:27.360
I think Marlon back there is my father.
