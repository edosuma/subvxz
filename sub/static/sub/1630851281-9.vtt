00:05.135 --> 00:07.833
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

00:07.877 --> 00:08.573
I would like to formally give
my endorsement for union rep.

00:08.617 --> 00:09.966
John Nolan.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.229
- Dad was a monster.
- Dad's dying.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.665
I'm really sorry
about today.

00:13.709 --> 00:14.753
I'm still not going to
see him.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.059
La Fiera took Angela.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.018
I need to know where
she's holding her.

00:18.061 --> 00:20.020
No problem.
- I'll do whatever
it takes to get her back.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.369
You work for me now.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.892
Making a deal
with Elijah

00:22.935 --> 00:24.546
was the only way that I could
get you home safe.

00:24.589 --> 00:26.330
Well, you're not
becoming a C.I.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.724
I will do everything humanly
possible to keep him safe.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.030
We can't screw this up.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.205
We won't.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.384
Ugh.

00:36.427 --> 00:39.343
7-Adam-15, Code 4.
Suspect is in custody.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.651
♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly,
fa-la-la-la-la ♪

00:42.694 --> 00:43.695
Are you looking at
engagement rings?

00:43.739 --> 00:45.741
Maybe. What do you think
of this one?

00:45.784 --> 00:47.482
Oh, for Bailey?
Oh, my God.

00:47.525 --> 00:48.918
Are you going to propose?

00:48.961 --> 00:50.398
Uh, maybe.
I mean, I'm thinking about it.

00:50.441 --> 00:51.616
I-I know we haven't been dating
very long --

00:51.660 --> 00:53.879
No, what matters
is how you feel,

00:53.923 --> 00:56.665
and -- and I've never
seen you happier.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.362
Me and my lady got hitched
after three weeks,

00:58.406 --> 00:59.711
and we're still
going strong.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.017
- When you know, you know.
- Exactly.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.105
The only thing
I don't know

01:02.149 --> 01:03.237
is what kind of ring
she would like.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.326
But that's -- that's
pretty, right?

01:05.369 --> 01:07.328
No one wears emerald cut
anymore.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.807
There's a reason
I left that behind.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.593
Was Henry excited
when you told him?

01:11.636 --> 01:15.075
Henry.
They haven't even met.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.294
I can't think about proposing
until I get his blessing.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.687
Invite them both over
for dinner.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.210
He's in Japan
through Christmas.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.038
Oh. You know what?
This is good.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.822
It'll give you time
to plan the proposal,

01:23.866 --> 01:26.086
and I know of a photographer
that's not too expensive.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.262
A photographer...
for a proposal?

01:28.305 --> 01:29.915
I could hook you up
with the choreographer

01:29.959 --> 01:31.743
- that designed mine.
- Choreographer?

01:31.787 --> 01:33.615
Okay. Um, see,
I was just thinking about

01:33.658 --> 01:38.228
going to a nice restaurant
and, you know, asking.

01:40.143 --> 01:43.190
Yeah. Let's workshop it
back at the station.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.756
Come on.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.324
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪

01:47.368 --> 01:52.329

01:54.462 --> 01:56.986
Oh, I see
what you're doing there.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.423
You asked me
to help decorate your tree.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.860
Yes, that was to trick you into
staying for a few more days.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.035
No trickery required.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.689
Mm.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.605
You know, in spite of myself,
I have really enjoyed

02:07.649 --> 02:10.173
this whole being taken care of
thing the last few weeks.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.696
And now that my leg
is feeling better,

02:11.740 --> 02:14.699
I want to start
making it up to you.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.701
Well, while I like
the sound of that,

02:16.745 --> 02:19.182
it's really --
really not necessary.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.575
I mean, that's one of
the many built-in perks

02:20.618 --> 02:21.967
of being in
a healthy relationship.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.013
Which, by the way,
do you still feel

02:24.056 --> 02:25.580
you're terrible
at intimacy?

02:25.623 --> 02:27.886
I may have graduated
to mediocre.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.062
Oh, I'd say
you're at least intermediate,

02:30.106 --> 02:31.542
if not proficient.

02:31.586 --> 02:32.282
Oh.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.675
By the way,

02:33.718 --> 02:34.850
Henry's supposed
to call this morning.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.068
I was hoping the two of you
could talk

02:36.112 --> 02:38.941
and finally get a chance
to know one another.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.726
I would love that,
but it's my first day back

02:41.770 --> 02:43.511
from medical,
and I can't be late.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.252
Speaking of...

02:45.295 --> 02:46.731
Is he free tonight?

02:46.775 --> 02:47.819
Uh, well, he might be in
meetings.

02:47.863 --> 02:50.387
Tonight is tomorrow for him,
I think?

02:50.431 --> 02:51.954
I don't know. I keep forgetting
how the time change works.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.173
Okay, another day,
then.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.522
I'm so sorry,
I have to go,

02:54.565 --> 02:56.088
and tell Henry
I said hi, okay?

02:56.132 --> 02:57.438
Okay.
Bye.

02:57.481 --> 02:58.656
See ya.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.223

Uh, no.
No -- No problem.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.451
How's Japan?

03:10.494 --> 03:12.714
Well, Nolan says
an open concept sells better,

03:12.757 --> 03:14.672
so I'm thinking
we take out this wall

03:14.716 --> 03:16.196
and then move on
to the kitchen.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.676
Do you remember how Mom used to
make us pose by the window

03:18.720 --> 03:20.461
for every formal dance?

03:20.504 --> 03:22.071
Oh, my gosh.
My mom did that, too.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.465
And I always had to have
a wrist corsage.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.075
Yes.
Why was that ever a thing?

03:26.118 --> 03:28.164
No.
No more reminiscing.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.948
This is about fixing up
the house and selling it.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.994
- That's it.
- What? Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

03:32.037 --> 03:34.823
I mean, you guys are ending
a huge chapter in your lives.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.303
You guys need closure.

03:37.521 --> 03:38.914
What?

03:38.957 --> 03:40.307
I said you need closure!

03:40.350 --> 03:41.743
What?

03:41.786 --> 03:43.048
You're an idiot.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.792
Did you vote yet?

03:47.836 --> 03:49.272
The polls just opened
20 minutes ago.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.665
We have all week.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.449
I know.
Vote for change.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.538
I just know
that low voter turnout

03:54.582 --> 03:55.713
is an epidemic
in this country,

03:55.757 --> 03:56.845
and I don't want to
lose to apathy.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.020
Can I ask you something?

03:58.063 --> 03:59.282
Do you think
marriage proposals

03:59.326 --> 04:00.936
have to be a big spectacle
nowadays?

04:00.979 --> 04:02.285
No. No.

04:02.329 --> 04:05.027
All those viral
flash mobs are tacky.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.029
It should be
an intimate moment,

04:07.072 --> 04:09.292
not some desperate grab
for likes.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.989
Okay.
That's what I thought,

04:11.033 --> 04:12.948
but Lucy seems to think
I need to plan

04:12.991 --> 04:14.341
something extravagant.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.386
Is Lucy the one
you're proposing to?
No.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.562
Am I the one
you're proposing to?
No.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.782
So why are you talking to either
of us about this?
Right.

04:20.825 --> 04:24.525
The only person's opinion
who matters is Bailey's.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.570
Yeah, I-I'm not even sure
myself yet.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.659
I'm just testing
the waters.
Mm-hmm.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.835
Well, whenever you do,
make sure

04:30.879 --> 04:33.621
that you let her
help you pick out a ring.

04:33.664 --> 04:36.711
Donovan got me this massive
diamond that cost a fortune

04:36.754 --> 04:38.800
and was not
my style at all.
Really?

04:38.843 --> 04:41.019
One of the best things
about the divorce

04:41.063 --> 04:43.283
was finally getting to
sell that thing.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.762
Huh.
Tamara, hey.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.503
Oh.
Hey, John.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.157
Do you know where
Sergeant Grey's office is?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.506
I sure do.
The big glass one right there.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.334
Oh. Thank you.
See ya.

04:52.814 --> 04:53.989
Hey.
Ready for our interview?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.819
I am so sorry.
I -- Something came up.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.734
Is there any way we can
reschedule to next week?

04:59.777 --> 05:03.390
Uh, my criminal sociology
paper's due on Friday.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.261
But it's fine.
I'm sure whatever you're doing

05:05.305 --> 05:06.654
is way more important.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.395
Remind me what this paper's
about again.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.311
Um, how aging affects
perspectives of cops
throughout their career.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.313
And Lucy told me you'd be
the perfect candidate

05:13.356 --> 05:14.618
because you're an old --

05:14.662 --> 05:17.273
I'm sorry.
Uh, I mean veteran officer.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.579
Right.

05:20.929 --> 05:21.973
Follow me.

05:25.281 --> 05:28.371
Smitty, this is Tamara.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.851
She'll be shadowing you.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.374
You mean like a ride-along?

05:31.418 --> 05:33.071
No. Not --

05:33.115 --> 05:36.423
You are not to step foot outside
this station with her.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.599
Just show her around,
answer her questions.

05:38.642 --> 05:39.904
Sure thing, boss.

05:42.907 --> 05:45.388
There's nothing I don't know
about policing.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.998
Ask me anything.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.260
You spelled
"magnet" wrong.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.396
Our target
is Elijah Stone.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.442
He's smart
and ruthless.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.966
Multiple agencies have tried
to get listening devices

05:58.009 --> 05:59.533
in his base of operation.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.317
Every attempt has failed.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.275
But other agencies didn't have
our ace in the hole --

06:03.319 --> 06:04.886
Wesley Evers.

06:04.929 --> 06:07.497
As Elijah's lawyer,
Wesley is ideally situated

06:07.541 --> 06:10.718
to place a listening device
in Elijah's main office.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.329
Please familiarize yourself
with the briefing materials

06:13.373 --> 06:14.678
and be ready to roll out
in an hour.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.506
That's it.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.639
You don't have to do this,
you know.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.075
Yes, I do.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.555
This is the bug
you'll be planting.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.557
Did you read the list
of suggested locations

06:23.600 --> 06:24.949
I put together?

06:24.993 --> 06:26.298
I did, but I doubt
I'm gonna time

06:26.342 --> 06:27.952
to unscrew
an electrical socket.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.563
With limited time,
I would focus on someplace high

06:29.606 --> 06:30.825
or someplace low.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.609
The most important thing
is doing it safely.

06:32.653 --> 06:35.133
Agreed. If you do not have
the opportunity today,

06:35.177 --> 06:36.178
that's fine.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.309
We can try again

06:37.353 --> 06:38.572
when you meet with him
next time.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.748
Wesley, Metro wants to go over
a few things.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.058
I know cops aren't supposed to
make promises,

06:47.102 --> 06:48.930
but promise me
you'll keep him safe.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.760
We promise.

06:52.803 --> 06:55.284
So, you've been on the force for
30 years.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.285
What's been
the biggest challenge

06:56.328 --> 06:57.547
as you've gotten older?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.723
The change in technology?
Procedure?

06:59.767 --> 07:01.551
Yes.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.859
Hey, you ever heard of
ClipTalk?

07:04.902 --> 07:07.035
I'm trying
to upload a meme.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.387
You can't be serious.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.649
This is how you want to
beat your opponent?

07:12.693 --> 07:14.651
Hell yeah.
Help me go viral

07:14.695 --> 07:16.653
and I'll buy you
a candy bar.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.004
Surveillance is in position.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.485
Copy.
Rescue Vehicle One in position.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.748
Wesley should arrive for
his meeting with Elijah

07:24.792 --> 07:26.446
in about 10 minutes.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.843
Oh, my skip tracer
just sent his report.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.062
<i>Your</i> skip tracer?

07:34.105 --> 07:35.411
Well, yeah, I can't use
police resources

07:35.455 --> 07:36.586
to run personal
background checks,

07:36.630 --> 07:38.849
so I got a guy
on retainer.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.460
You should have one, too.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.591
What do you got him
looking for?

07:41.635 --> 07:43.071
Leverage.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.681
I'm trying to find anything
I can use

07:44.725 --> 07:46.378
to keep Donovan
from getting custody

07:46.422 --> 07:48.642
and moving Lila
to San Francisco.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.905
And?
Did he find anything?

07:50.948 --> 07:53.168
Uh, no.

07:53.211 --> 07:57.172
Quote, "Your ex is so boring,
I am charging you double."

07:57.215 --> 07:58.652
You guys are so lucky.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.784
I begged my mom and dad
to have a sibling.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.525
They got me a turtle.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.485
Um, it was cute,
but a little smelly.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.096
Cute and smelly pretty much
sums up Tim's teenage years.

08:08.139 --> 08:10.098
You didn't miss much.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.666
Wow. And to think
I was actually excited

08:12.709 --> 08:14.319
when they brought you home
from the hospital.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.538
Little did I know.

08:17.627 --> 08:20.412
<i>♪ It's been too long</i>

08:20.456 --> 08:24.025
<i>♪ And get back home</i>

08:25.896 --> 08:26.941
<i>♪ It's been too long</i>

08:26.984 --> 08:28.377
What is it?

08:28.420 --> 08:30.379
There's -- There's something
in the wall.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.555
Ooh, is it my Malibu Barbie?
She's worth a lot now.

08:32.599 --> 08:33.861
No. It's --
It's metal.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.080
<i>♪ You been out on the road</i>

08:45.133 --> 08:47.570
What the hell is a gun doing
in our wall?

08:51.748 --> 08:53.533
How long has that
been back there?

08:53.576 --> 08:55.317
It's hard to say.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.712
Look. The serial number's
been filed off.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.149
That's what criminals do,
right?

09:01.192 --> 09:02.846
We need to run ballistics.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.892
Wait, you don't actually think
it was used in a crime?

09:04.935 --> 09:06.633
Well, it's our job
to find out.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.373
We'll be back
as soon as we can.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.158
But it's your day off.
You said you'd help.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.681
It won't take long.

09:11.725 --> 09:12.900
C'mon, Chen.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.076
I knew you'd find
some excuse to leave.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
Genny,
this is serious.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.558
It's fine.
Go.

09:20.864 --> 09:21.473
Uh...

09:23.998 --> 09:25.608
Hey, she's got a point.

09:25.652 --> 09:26.870
I mean, you could've called
someone to handle this.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.480
You still can.

09:28.524 --> 09:30.613
No, a good sergeant doesn't
create work for his officers.

09:30.657 --> 09:31.701
Even on his day off.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.268
And it's not at all about
the emotions

09:33.311 --> 09:34.791
this house is stirring up?

09:34.835 --> 09:36.271
It's just a house.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.144
Holy crap.
What?

09:40.188 --> 09:43.626
My skip tracer looked into
Penelope, Donovan's fiancée.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.628
She used to be an escort.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.282
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.763
She's -- She's been lying to him
this whole time.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.068
Well, you don't know that.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.461
She may have already told
Donovan.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.071
Or, heck, that could be
how they met.

09:54.115 --> 09:56.465
Oh, no. No.
Donovan is such a prude.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.336
If he found out,
he would lose it.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.905
And if the court found out,
you'd win your case.

10:01.949 --> 10:05.648
It just doesn't feel right,
bringing her into our fight.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.084
And the fact that
she was a sex worker

10:07.128 --> 10:09.739
has no bearing on her
as a stepmom.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.262
Neither does you doing
undercover,

10:11.306 --> 10:12.786
but he's using that
against you.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.310
Sure, but using her past
against her

10:15.353 --> 10:17.094
makes me just as bad
as Donovan.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.401
I can't. I-I got to figure out
something else

10:19.444 --> 10:20.881
to change his mind.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.012
Okay.
Any ideas how?

10:22.056 --> 10:23.492
No.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.061
Heads up.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.497
Wesley's going in.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.264
Sit down.

10:56.307 --> 10:59.093
So, how are we getting Reyes
out of trouble?

10:59.136 --> 11:01.269
I can get the witness testimony
thrown out, but the, uh,

11:01.312 --> 11:02.966
<i>surveillance video's
a whole other problem.</i>

11:06.927 --> 11:08.319
Looking for something?

11:08.363 --> 11:10.495
You guys paint
since I was last here?

11:10.539 --> 11:11.714
<i>No.</i>

11:11.758 --> 11:12.759
Room looks different.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.761
Must be the Christmas
decorations.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.719
As I was saying,
the video is a problem,

11:16.763 --> 11:18.286
but your bigger issue
is your guys

11:18.329 --> 11:19.983
don't know how to
- get arrested.
- He's doing great.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.506
<i>They can't keep assaulting
police officers.</i>

11:21.550 --> 11:22.943
Yeah.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.553
He'll be fine.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.163
Resisting arrest is making
my life harder.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.861
You hear that, Moreno?

11:27.904 --> 11:30.124
Our friend thinks I'm making
life too hard for him.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.430
No, it's just --It's what, Counselor?

11:32.474 --> 11:33.736
What part
of our arrangement

11:33.780 --> 11:35.433
is about making
your life easier?

11:35.477 --> 11:37.871
Hmm. Nothing.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.307
<i>Piece of
unsolicited advice --</i>

11:39.350 --> 11:40.700
fire Reyes
as soon as possible.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.919
So? He punched
the arresting officer.

11:42.963 --> 11:45.574
- Reyes is good people.
- Reyes is a moron.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.881
He bragged about the assault
to an inmate in lockup,

11:47.924 --> 11:49.621
ended up being
an informant.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.711
- Where is he?
- Making a run
to the food bank.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.887
Alright, when he's done,
get him in here.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.672
Someone needs a refresher course
on keeping his damn mouth shut.

11:58.413 --> 12:03.592
Now, I'm hearing whispers about
a threat on the horizon,

12:03.635 --> 12:05.289
but I can't
get traction on it.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.204
- That's news to me.
- Well, what about
your wife?

12:07.248 --> 12:08.771
Has she heard anything?

12:08.815 --> 12:10.730
Uh... I don't know.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.383
<i>You guys are
lucky to have me.</i>

12:12.427 --> 12:13.994
That's the signal.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.778
Point to all units.
Friendly has given the signal.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.693
Go ahead and initiate
"Blind Eye."

12:17.737 --> 12:19.869
I can't make any promises,
but...

12:22.045 --> 12:24.091
What's going on?

12:24.134 --> 12:25.266
We may have a problem.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.276
Get your hands up!

12:35.319 --> 12:36.581
- Get your hands up!
- Hands up!

12:36.625 --> 12:38.409
- Don't move!
- Hands behind your head.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.497
Get down
on your knees.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.195
Well, that's not ours.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.500
No.
Never seen him before.

12:42.544 --> 12:43.545
Everything okay, guys?

12:43.588 --> 12:45.721
Yeah, it's nothing.
Just, uh...

12:45.765 --> 12:48.419
That's the second signal.
He's planted the bug.

12:48.463 --> 12:51.292
Music has been deployed.
Stop units can clear.

12:51.335 --> 12:53.816
He did it.
Now get out of there.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.687
<i>Well, that's it.</i>

12:55.731 --> 12:56.993
<i>That's all I got for you.</i>

12:57.037 --> 12:58.603
He's walking out now.

12:58.647 --> 12:59.822
Okay, good work,
Counselor.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.824
Keep me updated on Reyes.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.478
Will do.
But seriously,

13:03.521 --> 13:05.393
fire him or teach him
to keep his mouth shut.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.526
Boaz.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.398
Come walk out the lawyer.
He's ready to go.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.052
<i>Go again.</i>

13:13.618 --> 13:15.316
Boaz, do you copy?

13:15.359 --> 13:16.970
Come get the lawyer.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.712
That's static.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.236
The bug Wesley planted
could create interference

13:22.279 --> 13:23.759
with a two-way radio.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.979
We didn't know they use
walkie-talkies in there?

13:26.022 --> 13:27.763
- Harper, come in.
- Already on it.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.766
All units, stand by.
Be ready to breach on my go.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.941
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

13:31.985 --> 13:33.769
Come again?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.858
Can I just walk
myself out?

13:35.902 --> 13:37.555
I mean, seriously,
I have a meeting across town

13:37.599 --> 13:38.600
in 30 minutes.

13:38.643 --> 13:39.862
Oh, no, no.
Slow up, Counselor.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.168
It can wait.

13:44.736 --> 13:47.348
This is very interesting.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.657
<i>You know, from what I recall,
when the sirens went off,</i>

13:52.701 --> 13:55.704
<i>you didn't even jump.</i>

13:55.747 --> 13:56.966
<i>Didn't even bother
to look.</i>

13:57.010 --> 13:59.664
It's almost like you knew
they were coming.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.188
What the hell
are you talking about?

14:07.672 --> 14:08.586
Mm.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.507
We may need
a new exterminator.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.248
We have to go now.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.902
No. Elijah's too smart

14:19.946 --> 14:22.296
to hurt Wesley
while we're listening.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.993
All units hold.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.734
What is that?

14:25.777 --> 14:29.129
No, no, no, no.
Don't even play.

14:29.172 --> 14:32.262
Testing, testing.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.134
Can you hear me?

14:34.177 --> 14:37.224
Whoever you are.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.704
Is it the FBI?

14:39.748 --> 14:41.793
The DEA?
Oh, wait.

14:41.837 --> 14:45.145
No. Of course.
What am I thinking?

14:45.188 --> 14:47.016
It's the LAPD.

14:47.060 --> 14:50.411
I bet your lovely wife is out
there listening, too, isn't she?

14:50.454 --> 14:53.544
Angie, you out there,
sweetheart?

14:53.588 --> 14:55.416
You're smart.
You know I don't say

14:55.459 --> 14:57.548
anything incriminating
in front of your husband,

14:57.592 --> 14:59.159
so you turned him into
a Trojan Horse

14:59.202 --> 15:01.509
to leave a bug behind.

15:01.552 --> 15:04.991
And your little game
almost worked, too.

15:05.034 --> 15:08.820
Speaking of games,
you know what my favorite is?

15:08.864 --> 15:11.780
"I Spy."

15:11.823 --> 15:16.219
I spy with my little eye
a pest control van.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.178
No. No.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.789
No, you wouldn't be in there.
That's too "Miami Vice."

15:20.832 --> 15:23.052
Oh.
There's a mail truck.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.749
<i>No, no, no.
That has to stay on the move,</i>

15:24.793 --> 15:26.229
lest someone
get suspicious.

15:26.273 --> 15:30.016
Oh. The minivan.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.975
Roomy enough for equipment,
yet nondescript.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.282
So, tell me, Angie,
did I win the game?

15:35.325 --> 15:37.893
Of course I did.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.460
I always win.
You know why?

15:39.503 --> 15:42.724
Because I play by
the rules.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.465
Which means I'm gonna report
your husband

15:44.508 --> 15:47.076
to the California State Bar.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.991
That's right.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.775
I'm gonna have
his law license revoked

15:50.819 --> 15:53.213
for betraying the trust
of a client.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.954
This is not over.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.391
For you, it is.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.004
Wesley, come on, man.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.050
He's all yours.
I just fired him.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.313
- Listen to me closely.
- Uh-huh.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.010
You lay a hand on him
or his family,

16:08.054 --> 16:10.230
it'll be the last thing you do
as a free man.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.275
I don't need to
touch him.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.060
He just screwed himself.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.017
Let's go.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.497
Walk away.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.978
Until we meet again,
Counselor.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.202
Hey, ballistics came back on
the gun we found in the wall.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.638
That was fast.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.336
Yeah, I mean, I had to buy
a case of Girl Scout cookies

16:29.379 --> 16:31.860
from Derek's kid.
You're welcome.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.863
Okay, so, the striations
from the gun match up

16:34.906 --> 16:38.127
with a bullet from
a homicide from 25 years ago.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.825
The murder victim's name
was Frank Ochoa.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.566
He lived down the street.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.394
I was 14
when he was murdered.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.657
According to the case file,
Frank's murder

16:46.701 --> 16:49.660
was the result of a suspected
botched home invasion.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.010
Well, I think we can
rule that out

16:51.053 --> 16:52.489
now that we found the gun
in our wall.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.230
Do you remember anything
from that night?

16:54.274 --> 16:55.753
Yeah,
I had a football game.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.974
Uh, my mom took me and Genny,
and when we got back,

16:59.018 --> 17:01.150
there were
cops everywhere.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.804
My dad hated that guy.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.197
Your dad had an alibi.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.373
Um, Frank's wife, Monica.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.070
She was at the house.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.072
He was helping her
with her taxes.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.682
Monica is not
a solid alibi.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.684
They were having
an affair.

17:13.728 --> 17:16.687
My mom didn't know,
but I did.

17:16.731 --> 17:20.691
Uh, if -- if Frank discovered
the affair --

17:20.735 --> 17:23.042
My dad would have had motive
to kill him.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.565
That's how the gun ended up
in the wall.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.697
Okay, but why hide it
in there?

17:26.741 --> 17:29.178
I mean, why not just dump it
in a storm drain or an ocean?

17:29.222 --> 17:30.962
I don't know.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.182
- You did good today.
- Not good enough.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.967
The radio interference
wasn't your fault.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.535
Doesn't make me
any less scared.

17:38.579 --> 17:39.971
What's next?

17:40.015 --> 17:42.148
We regroup and hit this
in the morning.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.324
You two go home,
cuddle Jack.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.803
Install the VARDA system.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.675
And get to know
your security detail.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.546
- VARDA?
- Don't worry.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.940
It's only the most intrusive
and creepy security system

17:51.983 --> 17:53.855
ever invented.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.161
Thank you
for everything.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.640
I wish I could do more.

18:05.910 --> 18:09.523
Hey. Why are you letting Smitty
walk all over you?

18:09.566 --> 18:12.395
I'm not letting Smitty --Yes, you are.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.528
I've been here watching Smitty
talk smack about you

18:14.571 --> 18:16.834
to the other officers.
I-It's obscene.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.227
Please tell me you're planning
on hitting back.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.838
Okay, I agree
it's not great,

18:20.882 --> 18:22.797
but Smitty has chosen
his path,

18:22.840 --> 18:24.233
and I'm not gonna get anywhere
if I resort to

18:24.277 --> 18:25.626
the same tricks he does.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.018
But you're still not
gonna get anywhere

18:27.062 --> 18:28.324
if you let this happen,
either.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.760
You could lose.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.545
I think negativity
turns off voters.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.416
I'm gonna run
a clean campaign --

18:33.460 --> 18:36.376
and apologies, I do have a call
scheduled with my son.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.551
Can we pick this up later?

18:37.594 --> 18:38.943
Sure.
Thank you.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.126
Don't tell me you have
more interview questions?

18:47.169 --> 18:49.171
Just one.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.781
You want to go viral?

18:50.825 --> 18:52.174
I'll help you
make the video.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.568
What's your
ClipTalk password?

18:54.611 --> 18:55.960
Hey, where you going?

18:56.004 --> 18:57.614
Monica Ochoa's
in Interrogation.

18:57.658 --> 18:58.746
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.051
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.184
You're going to question
your father's mistress?

19:02.228 --> 19:03.751
She's his alibi.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.187
If anyone knows whether
or not my dad killed

19:05.231 --> 19:06.710
her husband, it's her.

19:06.754 --> 19:09.017
Yes, but you can't be
the one to question her.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.584
Look, we need to
do this right.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.675
You do it.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.070
Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Ochoa.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.638
Of course.
So, what is this all about?

19:21.682 --> 19:22.987
Your husband's murder.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.902
We recently had a break
in the case,

19:24.946 --> 19:26.904
and we just wanted to go over
a few details with you.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.254
<i>What do you mean,
a break in the case?</i>

19:28.297 --> 19:29.690
<i>It's been 25 years.</i>

19:29.733 --> 19:31.387
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss

19:31.431 --> 19:32.997
the details at this time.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.869
What do you remember
about that night?

19:34.912 --> 19:36.523
I have been over this
so many times.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.351
Don't you have the report?
It's all in there.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.874
I'm sorry.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.703
I realize this is
a painful subject.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.357
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.709
<i>I was across the street
at the neighbors'.</i>

19:48.752 --> 19:50.363
<i>The Bradfords.</i>

19:50.406 --> 19:53.583
<i>Right. Tom was helping me
with our taxes.</i>

19:53.627 --> 19:56.238
<i>Um, I had made
a mess with them,</i>

19:56.282 --> 19:59.633
and he was a CPA.

19:59.676 --> 20:03.593
When I got back home,
the door was open,

20:03.637 --> 20:06.161
and, um...

20:06.205 --> 20:09.033
the place was a mess.

20:09.077 --> 20:12.907
I-I'm sorry.
Um, it's been a very long time

20:12.950 --> 20:14.604
since I've had
to talk about this.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.868
Uh, just
take your time.

20:17.912 --> 20:21.872
I found, uh,
my husband, Frank.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.918
He was -- His body
was in the kitchen.

20:23.961 --> 20:28.662
Um, there was blood
everywhere.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.272
<i>I guess he surprised
whoever broke in,</i>

20:30.316 --> 20:33.841
and, um, they shot him.

20:33.884 --> 20:37.410
You were close with
the Bradford family?

20:37.453 --> 20:39.368
We socialized,
like neighbors used to.

20:39.412 --> 20:42.415
So, the night of the murder,
you were at their house,

20:42.458 --> 20:44.852
working on your taxes,
and, uh,

20:44.895 --> 20:46.593
the rest of the Bradford family
was there?

20:46.636 --> 20:48.899
<i>Uh, no, Mrs. Bradford
and the kids</i>

20:48.943 --> 20:52.251
<i>were at, um, a basketball game
or something.</i>

20:52.294 --> 20:54.601
<i>Okay, so you were alone
with the husband.</i>

20:54.644 --> 20:55.689
Was this
a regular occurrence?

20:57.343 --> 20:59.258
What are you getting at?

20:59.301 --> 21:02.130
I-I'm just trying to understand
what happened.

21:02.173 --> 21:06.308
Uh, did -- did Mr. Bradford, um,
leave at any point?

21:06.352 --> 21:10.399
<i>Uh, I-I'm sorry. Could we maybe
do this another time?</i>

21:10.443 --> 21:13.533
<i>It would be easier
if we got it done now.</i>

21:13.576 --> 21:16.144
I don't know.
Uh, you just sprung this on me,

21:16.187 --> 21:18.189
and, um,
you're asking a lot.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.713
Yeah. You know what?
If we just get

21:19.756 --> 21:21.280
a few more questions,
we'll -- we'll be done

21:21.323 --> 21:22.542
and get you
right out of here.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.022
No, I-I want to go now.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.115
Tim?

21:31.159 --> 21:33.204
Mrs. Ochoa.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.206
Did my father leave
at any point that night?

21:35.250 --> 21:38.732
Of course not. You think that
I lied to the police?

21:38.775 --> 21:40.386
Look, I know you were
having an affair --

21:40.429 --> 21:42.126
Excuse me?
It's fine.

21:42.170 --> 21:45.086
It was a long time ago.
But if you're protecting him --

21:45.129 --> 21:46.609
Okay. That's it.
I'm done.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.963
She's covering for him.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.226
Maybe,
but we can't prove that.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.315
Thanks so much.

21:59.535 --> 22:02.103
So, we have two officers
standing guard on rotation

22:02.146 --> 22:03.757
for the next 72 hours,

22:03.800 --> 22:05.367
motion sensors
in the front yard,

22:05.411 --> 22:08.022
and an alarm system
that will bypass 911

22:08.065 --> 22:10.285
and send a red alert
to every cop in the area

22:10.329 --> 22:11.852
if anything happens.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.549
No way Elijah makes it
through that door.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.377
How long do we have
to live like this?

22:15.421 --> 22:16.857
Hey, the only thing
that matters

22:16.900 --> 22:19.338
is that
our family is safe.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.165
It's gonna be okay.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.820
Totally. And I'm probably
gonna lose my law license,

22:23.864 --> 22:28.042
but on the bright side,
more time with Jack.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.177
- Where you going?
- Back to work.

22:33.221 --> 22:36.137
I'm not letting
that criminal beat us.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.012
Hi.

22:42.056 --> 22:45.407
Thanks for coming all the way
down here at the last minute.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.627
What am I doing here,
Nyla?

22:47.670 --> 22:49.629
Okay. Well, uh,
I know that we're back to

22:49.672 --> 22:52.153
talking through lawyers,

22:52.196 --> 22:56.070
but I thought we could have
an actual conversation

22:56.113 --> 22:59.378
and avoid dragging Lila
through another

22:59.421 --> 23:01.858
painful custody fight.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.294
Okay.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.687
What are you proposing?

23:04.731 --> 23:08.125
Since Lila has her school
and her friends here,

23:08.169 --> 23:11.955
I am proposing that she spend
the school year with me,

23:11.999 --> 23:15.698
and the entire summer,
she can be with you.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.092
And obviously,
you can visit any time.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.358
What are you thinking?

23:23.402 --> 23:24.446
I think
there's more to consider

23:24.490 --> 23:25.882
than just school
and friends.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.493
Okay, like what?

23:27.536 --> 23:29.669
Like the fact that you've been
an absentee parent

23:29.712 --> 23:31.105
until recently.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.672
Look, I will admit
that my old job

23:32.715 --> 23:34.151
took up a lot of my time,

23:34.195 --> 23:37.111
but that is why
I switched to patrol.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.853
I'm sorry, why are we meeting
in front of your station

23:39.896 --> 23:41.855
instead of the restaurant
you suggested this morning?

23:41.898 --> 23:44.118
Because I am working overtime
on a case.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.946
Right.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.687
So you want me to give you
full custody

23:47.730 --> 23:48.862
so a nanny
can raise our child?

23:48.905 --> 23:50.733
That is not fair.
Come on, Donovan,

23:50.777 --> 23:52.343
what is this really about?

23:52.387 --> 23:54.694
Let me guess --
- what happened at Halloween?
- No. No.

23:54.737 --> 23:57.479
Yes, it is. You feel guilty that
we slept together.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.134
- It was an accident.
- That we both made,

24:00.177 --> 24:04.486
so stop punishing me
over it.
I'm -- I'm not.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.532
For two years,
I have been the only parent

24:06.575 --> 24:08.316
helping her with her school
work, going on field trips,

24:08.359 --> 24:09.796
taking her to every single
doctor's appointment.

24:09.839 --> 24:11.188
Where were you?

24:11.232 --> 24:12.929
Okay.

24:12.973 --> 24:14.540
I think the court would agree
that I am the parent

24:14.583 --> 24:18.021
that is the most --Please do not do this.

24:18.065 --> 24:21.634
Not just to me,
but to our daughter.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.592
She's adaptable.
She'll make friends at school,

24:23.636 --> 24:25.202
and when she gets home,
she'll have two parents

24:25.246 --> 24:26.987
there waiting for her.

24:27.030 --> 24:30.773
Nyla, Penelope and I
can give her stability.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.906
Oh, right. Penelope.

24:32.949 --> 24:35.212
What's that
supposed to mean?

24:35.256 --> 24:37.606
Nothing.
I will see you in court.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.493
Oh, man.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.407
Never thought
I'd see your face again.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.235
Genny tell you to visit?

24:58.279 --> 25:02.022
Wow, liver really did
a number on you, old man.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.850
I don't have it so bad.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.635
Nurses here all love me.
It's just...

25:06.679 --> 25:08.985
no one will bring me that shot
of Patrón I keep asking for.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.120
Ah.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.556
Apple juice.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.210
It's a joke.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.952
You always seem to have
someone looking after you,

25:18.995 --> 25:20.867
even when
you don't deserve it.

25:20.910 --> 25:23.696
Something on your mind,
son?

25:23.739 --> 25:26.263
Remember Frank Ochoa?

25:26.307 --> 25:27.526
Lived down the street.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.876
Shot to death
25 years ago.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.095
Well, I-I'm sure you remember
his wife, Monica.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.532
Can't say that I do.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.142
Come on.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.884
You were sleeping with her
behind Mom's back.

25:37.927 --> 25:39.538
Where'd you get that from?

25:39.581 --> 25:44.281
Because I saw you two together
when I was 13.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.893
Oh. Crap.

25:46.936 --> 25:51.375
For some reason that I still
don't understand,

25:51.419 --> 25:54.117
I lied for you,
lied to Mom.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.728
Poor little Tim-Tim.

25:55.771 --> 25:58.687
What are you bitching about?

25:58.731 --> 26:00.950
You kept your mouth shut.
You did good.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.648
Now get over it.

26:02.691 --> 26:05.999
You know, I found the gun that
you hid in the wall.

26:06.042 --> 26:10.046
I know you killed Frank.

26:10.090 --> 26:13.789
But why'd you do it?

26:13.833 --> 26:16.749
You wanted Monica
all to yourself?

26:16.792 --> 26:19.142
Ruining one family just wasn't
enough for you, was it?

26:23.364 --> 26:25.584
And so what if I did?

26:27.586 --> 26:30.197
What are you gonna do
about it?

26:30.240 --> 26:31.677
Get back in bed.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.810
Make me.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.775
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

26:46.387 --> 26:48.650
You're right.

26:48.694 --> 26:51.087
I killed Frank.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.307
But he had it coming.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.614
So, screw him,
and screw you.

26:55.657 --> 26:56.919
Put the cuffs on me.

26:56.963 --> 26:59.400
Drag me away from my death bed
like a big man.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.184
This isn't over.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.708
Get the hell
out of here.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.761
Okay, one second.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.067
Here comes Bailey.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.459
Everyone on?

27:15.503 --> 27:17.592
<i>Hi, Henry. Hey, Bailey.</i>

27:17.636 --> 27:19.463
<i>It's nice to finally --</i>

27:19.507 --> 27:20.508
Buddy,

27:20.551 --> 27:21.988

27:23.076 --> 27:24.207
Now he's gone.
Hang on a second.

27:24.251 --> 27:25.382
I'll ring him up.

27:25.426 --> 27:26.906
Oh, there he is.
Hang on. I'll answer.

27:26.949 --> 27:29.430
There you are, Henry.
Can you hear me?

27:29.473 --> 27:31.084
<i>Hey, sorry, service is
a little spotty over here.</i>

27:31.127 --> 27:32.912
I'm just happy
my two favorite people

27:32.955 --> 27:34.391
finally get
a chance to meet.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.829
<i>Henry, your dad tells me
you're in Japan for work.</i>

27:36.872 --> 27:40.397
<i>Yeah. Some first</i>

27:40.441 --> 27:43.052
<i>Ben is</i>

27:43.096 --> 27:44.401
Buddy, you're breaking up.

27:45.925 --> 27:47.666
<i>Sorry. I gotta go.
We got a call.</i>

27:47.709 --> 27:49.319
Right, you go.
You go, Bailey.

27:49.363 --> 27:52.583
<i>So, was that</i>

27:52.627 --> 27:54.411
<i>Wait, what</i>

27:54.455 --> 27:57.458
Now you're frozen again,
and you're still breaking up.

27:57.501 --> 27:58.764
Henry, can you hear me?

28:00.330 --> 28:02.245
There you are.
Grey and Lopez have something.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.551
Great.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.990
- What's going on?
- Lopez figured out

28:08.034 --> 28:10.036
how Elijah smuggles drugs
into the country.

28:10.079 --> 28:11.646
We were replaying the tapes from
Elijah's office,

28:11.690 --> 28:13.126
and something stuck out.

28:13.169 --> 28:15.041
Elijah said that one of his
guys, Reyes,

28:15.084 --> 28:17.130
was making a run
to the food bank.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.697
He doesn't seem like
the selfless type.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.134
Exactly.
So we dug into his finances

28:21.177 --> 28:23.353
and found that he's been
making large donations

28:23.397 --> 28:26.052
of canned goods from a factory
in Mexico every month.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.097
Cans are sealed.
Dogs can't smell the drugs.

28:28.141 --> 28:30.360
So Elijah has his food bank
import the cans,

28:30.404 --> 28:31.666
and then his crew
distributes them

28:31.710 --> 28:32.667
throughout the Southland.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.973
- So, that's it.
- No.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.931
It's our theory.
Enough to get a warrant.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.628
And Elijah's
no one's fool.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.892
He knows we heard him
reference the food bank.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.937
He's probably clearing
the place out as we speak.

28:41.981 --> 28:44.157

Why?

31:27.798 --> 31:29.931
You came up with
the burglary story,

31:29.975 --> 31:32.716
helped her stage the house,
then you hid the gun

and you needed to

31:34.240 --> 31:36.459

32:25.247 --> 32:27.989

to protect us,

She's being processed right now.
