If your son goes to Camp Microchipewa,
he'll learn more than just computer skills.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.484
How about basketball?
That's right.

01:49.651 --> 01:54.239
Learn to shoot like Akeem and the Shaq, once
counselor Dave shows you the trajectory.

01:54.406 --> 01:57.701
If you're hungry,
Fridays are international fiesta days...

01:57.868 --> 01:59.870
featuring foods from
all over the world,

02:00.037 --> 02:03.332
including this favorite
from Italy... pizza.

02:03.498 --> 02:07.836
Whoops! It's awards day already.
The summer sure has flown by.

02:08.002 --> 02:11.632
At Microchipewa, you'll leave
with good friends, good memories...

02:11.798 --> 02:14.509
and a better understanding
of the job skills of the future.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.763
That's right.
Who says computers have to be boring?

02:17.929 --> 02:22.601
At Microchipewa Computer Camp, we say
that computers are really not... boring.

02:22.768 --> 02:27.064
Boy, I wish they had camps
like that when I was a kid.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.524
Sounds great, huh, Morris?

02:29.691 --> 02:31.401
It sounds fantastic!

02:31.568 --> 02:33.111
I'm in hell. Shoot me.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.448
So, did you decide about camp yet?

02:36.615 --> 02:40.243
That guy from MicroCamp swears they're getting
CD-ROMs with double-speed interfaces.

02:40.410 --> 02:45.123
- Sounds excellent, huh, Mud?
- Yo, dog breath... stay!

02:45.290 --> 02:48.877
Not you, Walter.
I want Mud.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.838
You're not supposed to
be in this hallway, pud.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.007
- Pud!
- Come on, stop it.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.342
What a dork!

02:55.509 --> 02:58.553
Hands off, Tim.
This little turd is mine.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.640
You need a bath, man,
in the porcelain jacuzzi.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.228
Don't let anybody in.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.902
All right, midget.
You got it?

03:16.071 --> 03:19.157
Damn!

03:19.324 --> 03:24.162
Here. You read The Red Badge
of Courage by Stephen Crane.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.581
I analyzed his depiction
of the Civil War.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.418
Uh, so who do I say won?

03:29.584 --> 03:33.046
- You went for the North.
- Okay.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.466
Anyway, I say it's good for a C+, easy.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.969
Cool, but make the next one a "B."

03:39.136 --> 03:40.804
So, how you doin', Mud?

03:40.971 --> 03:43.473
I'm okay.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.977
That musclehead in gym class tried
to hang me up by my underwear again.

03:47.144 --> 03:51.857
Wayne Fletcher? Don't worry. I've
got him covered. Okay, let's do it.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.818
Zack, do we have to?

03:54.985 --> 03:59.114
Look, Mud, I've told you a thousand times.
I've got a reputation.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.328
Oh-ho, Zack! Please stop it! Oh!

04:05.495 --> 04:08.331
Please, don't stick
my head in the toilet.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.752
I won't use the hallway again.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.003
Stylin', Mud.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.130
Yup. It's that
just flushed look.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.466
Looks good.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.510
- Call me later.
- Okay. Bye.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.804
- Call me later.
- Bye.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.767
If that idiot Epstein
gives us another grammar quiz,

04:26.933 --> 04:29.311
I swear I'm gonna wind up in
English as a Second Language.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.688
Or you'll have to take it
over in summer school.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.273
I'm already going
to summer school.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.483
Another computer camp?

04:34.649 --> 04:39.070
Yup. My parents won't be happy till I'm the
poster child for the "Adopt a Dork Foundation."

04:39.237 --> 04:43.784
Yeah, well, better than Camp Broadway.
"Did you get that Clearasil commercial?"

04:43.950 --> 04:47.829
Well, I'm up for Spaghetti-O's
Extra Meaty. Tres dull.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.290
Oh, Gaby, when's your mom
leaving for the islands?

04:50.457 --> 04:53.835
Right after she puts me
on the bus to Camp Slenderella.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.671
Oh, gross! Celery sticks
and rice cakes again?

04:56.838 --> 04:58.215
Prison food.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.758
I'll mail you a Twinkie.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.259
Thanks for waiting, guys.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.428
Yeah, well, you were busy
with your new delinquent friends.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.138
Trish, we're not
delinquent friends!

05:05.305 --> 05:06.389
Oh, yeah?

05:06.556 --> 05:10.435
Then how come you get sent to military camp
every summer? 'Cause you like the haircuts?

05:10.602 --> 05:15.065
You know my dad.
Builds character, Zachary.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.691
It's for your own good, Gab.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.528
But, Trish,
all the other kids are going.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.030
Wait, how 'bout this one?
It'll be fun.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.281
Yeah.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.700
Can you believe what Arnold brought
to school today? It was disgusting.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.952
It was degrading.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.954
That was cool!
That was really cool!

05:29.120 --> 05:30.163
That was so gross.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.998
- He needs help.
- He is beyond help.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.377
But, Morris, it'll be fun.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.172
Dad, all those computer camps
are nerd rehab centers.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.217
I just want to play baseball.
Have some real fun.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.262
The DOS tutorial isn't fun?

05:45.428 --> 05:48.807
Come on. Look, I wouldn't
steer you wrong.

05:48.974 --> 05:53.103
I know you think I'm an old fogey but your
old man still knows how to cut loose.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.398
Look, Morris, they have those
low-fat, sugar-free macaroons.

05:56.565 --> 06:01.111
Not only the best tasting, pasteurized,
processed, non-dairy imitation...

06:01.278 --> 06:03.655
semi-cheese product,

06:03.822 --> 06:06.658
but also the healthiest.

06:06.825 --> 06:10.036
Now, I'm not a licensed physician, but
I've been to my share of free clinics.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.206
Each serving of Miracle Cheese
contains no sodium, no glucose,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.500
no "mucose" and absolutely
no cholesterol.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.628
Let's talk about
breadstick safety.

06:18.795 --> 06:24.259
Your basic sesame breadstick.
No, it looks harmless enough.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.387
But what if you lose control
at high speeds?

06:27.554 --> 06:31.600
- - Easy Cheese comes in these...

06:31.766 --> 06:34.394
Now, Morris, I don't want to be
one of those pushy parents.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.146
It's too late.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.106
Now, what is that supposed
to mean, young man?

06:38.273 --> 06:40.609
I mean, what if I don't want
to go to computer camp?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.528
Morris, there are plenty of things
I'd rather do with $3,000.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.196
Me too.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.240
Havarti and Gorgonzola!

06:47.407 --> 06:48.700
Come on.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.076
Wait a minute!
You are thinking...

06:50.243 --> 06:54.080
cheese with... fish.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.458
Baa-aad.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.335
Morris!

06:58.501 --> 07:02.088
Well, let's go right to the source.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.259
Is it just me,
or it dry in here?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.219
Thank you very much.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.972
Be kind to your waitress.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.308
Good night, everybody.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.357
- Morris.
- Not the "potential" thing again?

07:20.523 --> 07:23.526
But that's just what
you've got: potential.

07:23.693 --> 07:27.113
Anyway, so after all that, he
lays the money guilt thing on me.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.865
You know, camps cost
thousands of dollars.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.200
Yeah.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.245
I say, give me the money, I'll buy a Harley
and I'll be outta your way the whole summer.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.915
With that kind of money,
we could just rent our own camp.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.541
I'd buy a new wardrobe.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.751
I'd buy The Gap.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.253
Whoa! Whoa! What'd you say?

07:42.420 --> 07:45.256
Oh, I said, for that kind of
money, we could rent our own camp.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.759
- It's brilliant!
- It's deranged!

07:47.926 --> 07:51.596
- It's suicide.
- Besides, we need an adult to pull it off.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.390
But we're adults,
one for each camp.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.058
And one really twisted one.

07:55.225 --> 07:59.813
- Who's gonna rent a cabin...
- What'd you just say?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.941
Did you guys hear about the guy who
taught drama before Mr. Ellison?

08:03.108 --> 08:05.777
Yeah, my sister had him.
Tres bizarre, she said.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.989
He tried to do Silence of
the Lambs as a musical.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.825
Anyway, he got fired
and left town.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.120
Yeah, well, he got fired, but
I'm not so sure he left town.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.247
The cheese guy?

08:18.415 --> 08:21.626
Okay, let's
do it. Mud.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.269
Hi.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.895
Can I help you?

08:42.063 --> 08:45.483
Yeah, uh... Is your name
Dennis Van Welker?

08:45.650 --> 08:49.070
No. Just inspectin' the hinges here.

08:50.697 --> 08:54.367
Look at that.
Low carbon content.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.874
- Uh, ooh. Are you sure your name isn't
Dennis Van Welker? -

09:02.250 --> 09:04.502
He used to be a
drama teacher at King Junior High.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.131
There are no drama teachers
living here.

09:08.298 --> 09:12.552
I mean, I'm assuming the guy's gotta
be, what, five, six feet long.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.764
So I'd have seen him.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.476
Why don't you step inside? Now.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.234
Don't make a sound.
Shh. It's show time.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.658
Kid, I think you're sittin' on my teeth.
Quick, gimme, gimme, gimme. Come on.

09:35.825 --> 09:39.454
Your teeth?
Sick! Gross!

09:41.081 --> 09:42.874
Hey, kid, I owe ya one.

09:43.041 --> 09:46.086
Van Welker!
You in there?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.757
Van Welker!

09:52.383 --> 09:55.595
Van Welker!

09:55.762 --> 09:58.264
Who the hell are you?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.308
Dennis Van Welker?

10:00.475 --> 10:03.311
Well, glad to meet you, Dennis.

10:03.478 --> 10:07.357
The name's T.R. Polk. I'm
looking for Dennis Van Welker.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.901
And according to my
information, you're him.

10:10.068 --> 10:14.155
Sorry, man.
Roland J. Orlando.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.449
Wait a minute!

10:16.616 --> 10:20.370
I bought this here trailer
from a feller named Van Welker.

10:20.537 --> 10:24.124
Yeah? Did this Van
Welker have a "caar"?

10:24.290 --> 10:27.085
Well, I guess he must've to
pull the trailer.

10:29.921 --> 10:35.426
In 1979, Dennis Van Welker bought
a Caribbean yellow Gremlin...

10:35.593 --> 10:38.888
from Rasmunsen's AMC-Jeep
in Columbus, Ohio.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.559
- A yellow Gremlin? - He signed a
contract for 48 equal payments...

10:42.725 --> 10:44.727
of $121 .43.

10:44.894 --> 10:48.398
He made five. We're still
lookin' for the other 43.

10:48.565 --> 10:52.193
- God! What a swine!
- Hey, come on.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.071
Last year, Rasmunsen
sold the debt...

10:55.238 --> 10:58.241
to Bulldog Collections;
that's me.

10:58.408 --> 11:02.370
- Well, Mr. Bulldog.
- Polk. T.R. Polk.

11:02.537 --> 11:06.875
I retire in October. When I go,
I'm goin' with a perfect record.

11:07.041 --> 11:11.713
So no piss-yellow coup is gonna
keep me out of the hall of fame.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.716
Now, what's in the shed?

11:14.883 --> 11:17.969
Look, I really should be gettin'
down to the plant.

11:18.136 --> 11:22.265
Dad! Dad!
Oh, nellie, Dad! It's an emergency!

11:22.432 --> 11:26.311
Uh, the plant just called. Number
three turbine's out of alignment.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.981
Hold your horses there,
Alphonse.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.234
Can't you see I'm helping
this man find a missing car?

11:39.657 --> 11:41.659
Not here.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.703
Of course it ain't.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.289
Sorry about the door.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.128
- Your kid, huh?
- Yup. Heir to the throne.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.881
Well, Van Welker
had no children.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.675
That's a tragedy.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.553
Well, if he turns up, give me a call.
I'd appreciate it.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.223
So would the Ohio State Police.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.065
- Don't hit him, Zack.
- I won't.

12:14.901 --> 12:18.780
You know, you really oughta get the Club.
Any idiot can hot-wire a Gremlin.

12:18.947 --> 12:22.242
What do you want from me?
The car was a dog.

12:22.408 --> 12:26.704
Late at night, I used to hear it barking
in the driveway.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.124
Mr. Van Welker, we don't
care about the car.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.002
How would you like
to make $1,000?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.255
A thousand bucks.
Ha!

12:35.421 --> 12:39.676
Chicken feed! Now, if you'll excuse
me, I gotta go call my broker.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.721
555-0093.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.014
I'm sorry?

12:45.181 --> 12:47.058
Polk's phone number,
Mr. Van Welker.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.519
Oh, I get it.
Shakedown time.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.939
And people say kids today
lack ambition.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.317
A thousand bucks, you say?

12:57.819 --> 12:59.988
Hmm.

13:02.282 --> 13:06.369
Mr. Himmel? Dennis Wozniak,
Binary Pines Computer Camp.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.454
Been expecting ya.
Come on in.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.456
Thanks.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.505
Hey, nice sweater.

13:17.672 --> 13:21.009
In today's job market, you've got to
master the skills of tomorrow, now.

13:21.175 --> 13:25.138
For instance, 379 of the
Fortune 500 companies...

13:25.305 --> 13:28.766
use exactly the same Novell
netware release that we teach.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.519
Here, Mr. Grotowski.

13:31.686 --> 13:35.773
Of course, you should know that our Trish
takes her precious horses pretty seriously.

13:35.940 --> 13:40.111
Acting, Dad! This is theater camp.
Caitlin goes to riding camp.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.196
Of course.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.825
It does sound
interesting, Jerzy.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.536
But she's been so happy at Lake
Broadway, and I think it's,

13:48.703 --> 13:50.788
I don't know, prestigious.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.542
Oh, it
is fine program, Mrs. Prescott.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.337
More than adequate.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.591
But how deep can you go
in, uh, six weeks?

14:01.758 --> 14:06.888
At Camp Sleek-Away, we believe
there are no fat people.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.057
There's fat, and there's people.

14:09.223 --> 14:13.186
Look, whatever dumb diet
you guys use, it won't work.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.604
Shh.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.982
She's right.
Diets don't work.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.276
Chocolate cake works.

14:20.443 --> 14:23.237
Well, it sounds like
a hell of an operation, Savage,

14:23.404 --> 14:27.283
but as I said on the phone, Zachary
will be going back to Camp Steelgrave.

14:27.450 --> 14:31.496
Well, Mr. Dell,
if you're happy with, uh,

14:31.662 --> 14:34.248
Weepy's results,

14:34.415 --> 14:36.584
I won't waste your time.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.545
Weepy?

14:39.712 --> 14:44.008
Just a nickname Sergeant
Steelgrave picked up in 'Nam.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.761
Isn't that interesting, Morris?

14:46.928 --> 14:49.430
You should look up "interesting"
in the dictionary, Dad.

14:49.597 --> 14:50.640
Morris.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.851
You know, Morris, if you were an ordinary
kid, it wouldn't matter so much.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.562
But you've got such...

15:00.608 --> 15:03.277
potential.

15:05.905 --> 15:11.285
And that is why our season
runs two weeks longer.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.913
She'd be gone for eight weeks?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.082
I know it is long time
to be separated.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.544
That means we wouldn't have to
come back from Europe until...

15:19.710 --> 15:22.630
When's Parents' Day?
August?

15:22.797 --> 15:27.093
At Shakespeare Hollow,
we do not have Parents' Day.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.680
We feel it encourages
independence.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.391
Say no more, Jerzy.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.936
I think we just have to do what's
right for our little girl.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.232
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mmm.

15:41.399 --> 15:45.111
It's fantastic!
This is great cake!

15:45.278 --> 15:47.488
It's very unusual.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.867
I'll be right back.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.871
- God, what'd you do?
- Yours is Betty Crocker.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.166
Hers is raw liver paste.

15:58.332 --> 16:02.336
So if it tastes like poison,
it must be diet food.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.136
Son, are you deaf or just stupid?
Answer that phone!

16:10.303 --> 16:12.472
I'm busy.
Get it yourself.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.682
Answer it or eat it, boy.

16:14.849 --> 16:18.769
I see Weepy's worked wonders.

16:18.936 --> 16:24.567
At Alpha Charlie, we scrape
'em down to bare metal.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.236
And it's worth it when they
look up at you and say,

16:27.403 --> 16:31.991
Dad was right, Major Savage.
I am scum.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.744
Answer the phone, son.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.830
Yes, sir.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.792
- Dell residence.
- How's it goin'?

16:41.959 --> 16:44.045
Check or plastic?

16:44.212 --> 16:47.173
- Cash.
- Mission accomplished.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.175
We're in.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.676
Yes!

16:51.469 --> 16:53.888
Feln's Miracle Spa?

16:54.055 --> 16:55.890
Yeah, I found it in the newspaper.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.017
Where? In the obituaries?

16:58.184 --> 17:01.020
Trust me.
It's perfect.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.898
So that's two cabins for the summer.
Am I right?

17:05.066 --> 17:08.319
- If you want more, you gotta call
me in Florida. - So, I don't get it.

17:08.486 --> 17:11.948
- Who built those tepees and
painted that weird bus? - Ahhh!

17:12.114 --> 17:16.035
That's interesting. In the late
'60s, a bunch of hippies...

17:16.202 --> 17:18.746
made this place into a commune.

17:18.913 --> 17:24.001
You know, there was all sorts of
sex and drugs and debauchery.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.712
I knew I'd been here before.

17:26.878 --> 17:30.925
- You mean you did that stuff here?
- No, not here.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.515
You won't regret this,
Mr. Bandersnatch.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.893
You're in for the most peaceful,
relaxing summer...

17:41.060 --> 17:43.729
of your whole lives.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.738
That was the Pineview
Air Force Base.

17:52.905 --> 17:57.368
The 5: 15 flyby,
they call it.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.537
You get used to it.
You get used to it.

17:59.704 --> 18:03.666
Then you miss it when it doesn't happen.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.043
So we should just
take the Greyhound.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.629
The bus?
Why can't we rent a limo?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.881
You know what'd be cool?
We should hitchhike.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.384
Yeah. That would be really cool.

18:13.551 --> 18:18.055
And then we should just, you know, leave our
pictures behind for them to put on the milk cartons.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.308
Hey, guys, I've been checking out
the train schedules. You wanna...

18:22.143 --> 18:24.729
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.148
- Hitchhike?
- Stupid.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.278
Walter.
Hi.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.865
- Pretty slick, Mud.
- What?

18:36.032 --> 18:39.952
I know what you're doing, Mud. That
computer camp you said you were going to;

18:40.119 --> 18:42.788
There's no such camp.

18:42.955 --> 18:47.501
Walter, if you tell anyone,
I'm gonna glue your mouth shut!

18:47.668 --> 18:51.297
Look, I won't tell. Not as
long as you let me come.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.632
No.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.594
Okay. If I don't go,
you don't go.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.263
All right.
But you can't tell anyone.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.098
I won't.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.810
Walter, who'd you tell?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.021
Just Betty Stoller.
You know, the redhead girl in Bio Lab.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.481
You idiot!

19:08.648 --> 19:10.816
Come on, at her old camp,
they used to go skinny-dippin'.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.193
No way!

19:12.360 --> 19:14.737
I am not sharing a sink
with Betty Stoller!

19:14.904 --> 19:18.240
I mean, she has food stuck in
her braces from last Christmas.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.660
You're all in on this.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.831
Walter, if you tell anybody
else, you're dead meat!

19:25.998 --> 19:29.001
- Look, I won't tell.
- Uh-oh.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.671
What?
What?

19:31.837 --> 19:33.839
Betty Stoller.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.639
- Hi, Mud.
- Hi, Mud.

19:41.806 --> 19:45.059
- We're definitely going to need a bus.
- Yeah.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.728
Wooo!
Yeah!

There's some important
stuff I gotta tell ya.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.176
Mud.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.265
Okay.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.519
There's three important
things I need to say.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.897
Louder!

21:55.064 --> 21:59.568
Number one: letters home to your parents,
once a week, so they don't get suspicious;

21:59.735 --> 22:05.241
and two: if anybody in town
asks, you don't speak English;

22:05.407 --> 22:08.410
and three: guys, this is
very important, all right?

22:08.577 --> 22:13.374
Please, report to me immediately if
anybody finds a Taco Bell, all right?

22:18.671 --> 22:21.590
Oh, I, uh,

22:21.757 --> 22:23.759
forgot one thing.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.139
Try rubbing them together.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.017
Maybe if you get it warm first.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.019
Will you just let me work?

22:34.186 --> 22:37.565
It's getting late, Walter!

22:37.731 --> 22:39.400
Is it too late to go to a motel?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.360
What if we can't get it going?

22:41.527 --> 22:43.737
There. Got it.

22:45.656 --> 22:48.158
- Thank God!
- Yeah, that was close.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.327
If I don't see Dylan, I die.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.039
I wanna make a toast.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.751
Here is to diet shakes.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.170
Yeah!

23:02.214 --> 23:05.342
And I say here's to
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

23:09.555 --> 23:13.142
Here's to swimming.
Right, Betty?

23:18.063 --> 23:20.357
I gotta say...

23:20.524 --> 23:22.693
This is major cool!
Yes!

23:26.572 --> 23:28.157
All right!

23:29.909 --> 23:32.786
It's gonna be a great summer.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.331
Here's to computer manuals.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.878
Here's to anything with bran!

23:41.045 --> 23:43.923
Hey, Steve, throw in your cello.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.717
Cello!
Cello! Cello! Cello!

23:51.764 --> 23:53.098
Yes!
Yes!

24:00.981 --> 24:03.734
Nowhere! Nowhere!

24:03.901 --> 24:06.695

24:06.862 --> 24:10.658

Nowhere! Nowhere!

24:10.824 --> 24:14.995
Nowhere! Nowhere!
Nowhere! Nowhere!

24:25.339 --> 24:27.049
Got you, Betty.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.677
I wasn't playing, Walter.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.261
Hey, you're it.
I got you.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.721
Shut up, Walter!

24:32.888 --> 24:35.182
- Come on, Betty. I got you.
- Shut up. Get away!

24:35.349 --> 24:37.685
- It's 2:00 in the morning.
- Cool.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.942
- Hey, Trish, watch this.
- Stay away from me!

24:49.446 --> 24:52.324
Ow! I hit something.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.534
What is it?

24:53.701 --> 24:55.160
- It's a car!
- What a wreck!

24:55.327 --> 24:56.578
It's not a wreck.
It's a classic.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.330
A classic?

24:58.497 --> 25:02.835
Yeah, we could rebuild the whole thing.
But it's gonna cost.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.336
How much money we got, Mud?

25:04.503 --> 25:07.506
Well, I didn't exactly
count it or anything.

25:09.550 --> 25:12.011
Geez, Mud,
how much you got in there?

25:12.177 --> 25:16.598
Well, it's a lot. I mean, it's everybody's money for the
whole summer. You know, I just thought I'd hold on till...

25:16.765 --> 25:18.809
Yeah, right. I think I'll just
hold onto my own, midget.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.854
No, Tim, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.815
Money, Mud.
Money, Mud.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.443
Money, Mud.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.404

- Money, Mud.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.365

Money, Mud.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.826

Money, Mud.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.995
Money, Mud.

25:40.873 --> 25:45.544
Look, you, guys. Come on. Be careful how you spend it,
alright, because it's gotta last through the whole summer.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.921
Besides, we don't want to
call attention to ourselves, alright?

25:48.088 --> 25:50.674
We're not gonna do
anything stupid.

25:50.841 --> 25:53.844

- Uh, no, Officer. I... Mm-mmm.

35:37.886 --> 35:41.431

35:41.598 --> 35:45.810

35:45.977 --> 35:48.730
Uh, no, I can't run.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.650

green one's for company.

37:06.766 --> 37:10.478

- Dad, yours is the blue one.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.942

him to get the disease.

37:16.109 --> 37:19.529
- I don't have any more questions.
I'll take a rain check. - Please, sit.

for your cooperation.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.826

- And that all my past life had been
but a preparation... - What is that?

this thing blows up, I could... go to prison.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.504
Yeah, sure, I can see it now.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.142

39:54.309 --> 39:59.188

or something. I mean, I'm just a kid, you know?

Yeah.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.963

40:24.130 --> 40:26.716
Are you gonna help me?

40:27.967 --> 40:31.512

No.

40:33.389 --> 40:36.809

40:39.354 --> 40:41.105

40:42.440 --> 40:44.859
Well, sure you can.

40:45.026 --> 40:48.821

40:51.908 --> 40:56.120
First event:
synchronized swimming. Very good.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.418
Second event:
Greco-Roman wrestling!

41:02.585 --> 41:05.254
Oh-ho, very impressive.
Filthy!

41:07.382 --> 41:10.218
Come on, bobsledding team!

41:10.385 --> 41:13.221

41:13.388 --> 41:16.015
Final event:
Mud in the mud!

41:18.935 --> 41:22.105
But the people
were filled with fear.

41:22.271 --> 41:24.607
They prayed for seven
days and seven nights...

41:24.774 --> 41:27.777
until the heavens finally
answered their call.

41:27.944 --> 41:30.863
And so, the goddess defeated
the army of demons.

41:39.080 --> 41:43.126
Then, vomited up
the sun and the stars...

41:43.292 --> 41:47.130
back into the inky
curtain of heaven.

41:47.296 --> 41:50.591
And thus, the
heavens were preserved.

41:50.758 --> 41:53.344
Then, the
windmill of the gods...

41:53.511 --> 41:56.014
began to turn...
again.

41:59.100 --> 42:02.812

42:20.079 --> 42:22.832
- Whatcha doin'?
- Omelettes.

42:22.999 --> 42:26.919
- Here, get to work. - What's wrong
with Pop Tarts and Slim Jims?

42:27.086 --> 42:30.214
I don't know. I just kind
of got tired of the stuff.

42:30.381 --> 42:33.176
Why don't you
chop some mushrooms?

42:34.802 --> 42:36.846
I don't get it.
I mean,

42:37.013 --> 42:40.266
what happened to the part about
the best summer of our lives?

42:40.433 --> 42:43.811
I mean, why do we end up doing all the
work? Same reason we don't shoplift...

42:43.978 --> 42:46.230
or cut class:
it's a curse.

42:46.397 --> 42:50.485
- I shoplifted once.
- Ha! You stole something?

42:50.651 --> 42:54.655
- Uh-huh.
- Ten to one you went back and paid.

42:56.866 --> 43:00.745
Okay, you're right.
It's a curse. I...

43:00.912 --> 43:03.456
Look, I'm just glad
there's two of us.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.249
Me too.

43:09.378 --> 43:11.506
Okay, troops, line up.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.927
Ashley: mushroom.
Amber: onion.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.972
- Lenny: plain.
- Cheese!

43:20.139 --> 43:22.308
- You said plain.
- Cheese!

43:22.475 --> 43:24.352
- Plain.
- Cheese.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.812
- Plain. Plain.
- Cheese. Cheese.

43:25.978 --> 43:27.980
- Cheese.
- Plain.

43:28.147 --> 43:30.817
Okay, fine, you win.
Plain.

43:32.485 --> 43:34.862
Who says you can't learn
anything from cartoons?

43:35.029 --> 43:37.448
Good one.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.035
So, keep it bandaged till the
weekend, don't get it wet...

43:41.202 --> 43:44.664
and if anybody asks, you took
a bullet for the president.

43:44.831 --> 43:48.918
All right. So you and your dad been
sharing chores in the kitchen?

43:49.085 --> 43:51.087
Oh, yes.
Every meal.

43:51.254 --> 43:54.340
That must be tough with your
dad working all the time.

43:54.507 --> 43:57.426
Oh, no, see, he makes the time.

43:57.593 --> 44:00.346
Yeah. Because we...
we do stuff together.

44:00.513 --> 44:03.766
We play baseball.
Yeah. And we, uh,

44:05.685 --> 44:08.020
chase squirrels?

44:08.187 --> 44:11.774
I mean, we talk a lot! Yeah, we talk a lot.

44:11.941 --> 44:15.611
And, uh... And you... I mean,
me and him, we're... Well,

44:15.778 --> 44:18.739
we're best friends.

44:18.906 --> 44:21.659
He gives me tons of advice
about teenage problems like...

44:21.826 --> 44:25.288
on drugs and alcohol
and girls and...

44:25.454 --> 44:29.333
kisses and teachers
and acne and peer pressure.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.169
Great.

44:31.335 --> 44:34.297
He's my role model.

44:34.463 --> 44:37.508
Well, uh, I think
you'll pull through.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.178
You could stand to gain
a few pounds though.

44:40.344 --> 44:44.724
Well, if you're concerned about the nutritional
arrangements, why not check 'em out yourself?

44:47.268 --> 44:50.188
Pardon me? Come over
for dinner Friday.

44:53.399 --> 44:58.029
If I don't feed you from all four food groups,
you can report me to the authorities.

44:58.196 --> 45:03.492
- That won't be necessary. - Come on.
It's part of the Hippocratic oath.

45:03.659 --> 45:08.247
I don't recall Hippocrates
mentioning dinner.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.666
Then he was a fool.

45:14.545 --> 45:17.840
Come on. Don't make me
burn the kid's arm again.

45:21.093 --> 45:23.471
I'll be there.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.223
All right.

45:32.438 --> 45:35.691
But how could you invite her over?
I mean, she's gonna find out.

45:35.858 --> 45:38.903
Mud, in a couple of years,
two things will happen:

45:39.070 --> 45:43.950
one: you'll grow a ridiculous mustache that
looks like fruit mold on your upper lip;

45:44.116 --> 45:47.453
two: you'll suddenly
understand why men...

45:47.620 --> 45:50.790
invite charming,
attractive women to dinner.

45:50.957 --> 45:55.378
- But, Dennis... - Relax, Mud. Van
Welker will protect your secret.

45:55.544 --> 45:59.006
Besides, Mom always
wanted me to marry a doctor.

46:02.677 --> 46:07.515
- Ow!
- Bonjour, guys. We got beer.

46:07.682 --> 46:08.891
Zack, they're gonna card you.

46:09.058 --> 46:10.059
Chill, Mud.

46:10.226 --> 46:12.019
This is way covered.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.732
I.D.? You gotta be 19
to buy this stuff.

46:16.899 --> 46:19.902
No problemo.

46:21.821 --> 46:25.324
You were born in 1963? Yeah.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.994
So that
would make you... 21.

46:28.160 --> 46:32.206
No! This is 1994.
That would make you 31.

46:32.373 --> 46:35.459
Wrong.
If he was born in 1963,

46:35.626 --> 46:39.922
and he's 21 then it's 1984.

46:40.089 --> 46:42.717
Can I see that I .D.,
Bobby?

46:45.094 --> 46:48.472
Purchasing alcohol with a fake I.D.
is a crime in this state, son.

46:48.639 --> 46:51.767
But it's for my dad!
He's in the parking lot.

46:51.934 --> 46:55.062
He's very, very, uh, handicapped.
I'll go get him.

46:55.229 --> 46:59.317
I'm sorry, son. Get Officer Hendricks
over here. Tell him we got an underage.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.527
Let's go, son.
No! Dad!

47:01.694 --> 47:04.822
Dad?

47:04.989 --> 47:07.199
- Dad?
- Dad.

47:07.366 --> 47:13.122
This guy didn't believe I was buyin'
beer for you 'cause of your bum leg.

47:13.289 --> 47:15.624
Oh.

47:15.791 --> 47:20.087
So, you had trouble
buyin' brew...

47:20.254 --> 47:22.631
for your dear, old dad.

47:22.798 --> 47:25.801
Hey, son?
That's my dad.

47:27.887 --> 47:31.015
Sorry for the
misunderstanding, Mike.

47:31.182 --> 47:34.518
But, the beer is for me.

47:34.685 --> 47:38.230
Breakfast of champions.

47:38.397 --> 47:39.732
Yeah.

47:39.899 --> 47:41.901
I do love my beer.

47:42.068 --> 47:44.695
Mmm.
Hey, look at this.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.697
Looks real, eh?

47:46.864 --> 47:49.075
Well, it's...
it's very lifelike, sir.

47:49.241 --> 47:52.661
Ha-ha! And you don't
waste time washing it.

47:52.828 --> 47:55.915
A little floor wax twice a
month and I'm in business.

47:56.082 --> 47:58.667
- Uh-huh. - That was close.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.545
Oh, I know.
Tres close.

48:01.712 --> 48:04.507
- Dennis, there's a cop following us.
- Uh-oh. It's Hendricks.

48:04.673 --> 48:06.842
What are we gonna do?

48:16.977 --> 48:19.313
Wigwam Wash 'N Go? What are
we doing at a car wash?

48:19.480 --> 48:22.483
This'll never work.
Haven't you ever heard of a clean getaway?

48:22.650 --> 48:25.736
- I still think we could have got the beer.
- Yeah, and you could've gotten probation.

48:25.903 --> 48:29.281
Stay in the car. I'll check it out.
Hey, see you, guys.

48:29.448 --> 48:32.701
Pull up, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am. We've got
an emergency here. Okay.

48:32.868 --> 48:36.705
Radioactive road grit. If you just
pull up forward, I'll get you goin'.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.958
Thanks, ma'am.

48:39.125 --> 48:41.335
- Help you, Officer?
- Yeah. Have you seen a...

48:42.711 --> 48:45.631
Haven't I seen you
out at the Feln place?

48:45.798 --> 48:50.511
Phlurm. Come on, just pull in. Spiff
up the cruiser for you. No charge.

48:50.678 --> 48:51.470
Thanks.

48:51.637 --> 48:52.555
No problem.

48:52.721 --> 48:54.098
Hey, have you seen any
Caribbean yellow Gremlins?

48:54.265 --> 48:56.892
No, but I seen a couple
of little blue pixies.

48:57.059 --> 48:59.395
Do I get out or what? No!
Just roll up your window.

48:59.562 --> 49:04.024
- Oh, damn.
- Phlurm, what the hell are you doing?

49:04.191 --> 49:08.654
I'm gonna talk you through the process.
A little service Wigwam provides...

49:08.821 --> 49:12.199
to help the customers better
understand the car wash experience.

49:12.366 --> 49:16.078
This is soap
that's biodegradable.

49:16.245 --> 49:19.623
Think how much this would hurt.

49:19.790 --> 49:23.419
If we used old-fashioned
abrasive brushes! Ah!

49:23.586 --> 49:27.047
Industrial grit remover.
You can feel it working.

49:27.214 --> 49:29.633
Whoa! Gotta love it!
Gotta love it!

49:29.800 --> 49:33.345
We rinse with water
heated to 130.

49:34.763 --> 49:37.558
Or maybe 140 degrees!

49:37.725 --> 49:41.353
Finally, the gentle air drying.

49:50.905 --> 49:53.449
And there you have it.
Thanks for...

49:53.616 --> 49:55.284
using Wigwam.

50:02.082 --> 50:03.792
Dennis, what happened?

50:03.959 --> 50:09.840
Complimentary hot wax.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.468
Hurry, get in!

50:21.602 --> 50:23.145
Okay, time for another
letter to our parents.

50:23.312 --> 50:27.233
Now, the computer camp had a big pizza
cookout on Friday. We watched Star Trek IV.

50:27.399 --> 50:31.111
- Everybody seen that? - Is that the one
where he fights the big Russian guy?

50:31.278 --> 50:33.656
Arnold, that's Rocky IV.

50:33.822 --> 50:38.911
- How do you spell pizza? - No, no, Lenny,
look, you're at fat camp, remember?

50:39.078 --> 50:43.874
You don't get pizza at fat camp. You get... I don't
know, chicken breasts with lemon. Now write that down.

50:44.041 --> 50:47.086
Pizza in fat camp.
What a dope!

50:47.253 --> 50:49.838
Check the Barney.

50:50.005 --> 50:53.676
Yeah, why don't you tell them about how you
won the pie-eating contest too, Lenny?

50:53.842 --> 50:55.678
Oooh.

50:55.844 --> 50:57.012
Sniff my butt,
toe-breath.

50:57.179 --> 51:00.975
- Would you guys shut up?
- Hey, midget, find my Waldo.

51:01.141 --> 51:04.645
- What Waldo?
- Would you guys be careful?

51:04.812 --> 51:07.731
- Back off, geek! - You're gonna
put somebody's eye out with that!

51:12.486 --> 51:14.947
I'm turning into my parents.

51:15.114 --> 51:17.533
Eeew.

51:27.960 --> 51:31.255
Mud? Can I come in?

51:39.847 --> 51:41.849
Are you okay?

51:43.934 --> 51:47.187
This whole camp was my idea.

51:47.354 --> 51:51.191
But nobody listens to me, you know.
I mean, everybody hates me.

51:51.358 --> 51:53.277
Everybody does not hate you.

51:53.444 --> 51:56.322
No, just everybody in camp
and all the girls.

51:56.488 --> 52:00.117
Girls don't hate you.
You think girls hate you?

52:00.284 --> 52:03.704
Gaby, I'm a geek. You're not a geek.
Morris...

52:03.871 --> 52:07.791
Gaby, look, I'm a geek.
All right?

52:07.958 --> 52:12.046
It's okay for boys to be geeky.
For a girl, it's different.

52:12.212 --> 52:15.174
I could wind up wearing a hairnet
and serving Jell-O in a cafeteria.

52:15.341 --> 52:18.302
No, that won't happen, because, you
know, tons of girls start out...

52:19.762 --> 52:22.348
lumpy.

52:22.514 --> 52:26.560
But, uh, I mean, that'll all change. You
know, you'll lose a little bit of weight.

52:26.727 --> 52:29.438
Then you'll start
to grow some...

52:29.605 --> 52:31.982
chests.

52:32.149 --> 52:35.402
And then you'll be, you know, I don't know, going
out with guys that hang me up by my underwear.

52:35.569 --> 52:38.489
Oh, I can hardly wait.

52:41.700 --> 52:44.078
Let's make an oath, okay?

52:44.244 --> 52:49.583
When we get cool, neither of us will
go out with those kind of jerks, okay?

52:49.750 --> 52:51.835
Who will we go out with?

52:52.002 --> 52:54.171
Each other.

52:54.338 --> 52:56.507
I mean, ex-geeks like us.

52:56.674 --> 53:00.928
- Because we'll be cool.
- Okay. Deal.

53:10.479 --> 53:13.023
I mean, later.

53:13.190 --> 53:17.444
Right.
When... we're cool.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.446
Right.

53:43.679 --> 53:45.431
One sick puppy!

53:49.393 --> 53:51.770
Rubber chicken.
Figures.

53:54.022 --> 53:56.817
Well, Van Welker.

53:56.984 --> 53:59.528
Hmm.
Easy Cheese.

53:59.695 --> 54:02.573
Can I help you?

54:02.740 --> 54:07.619
So, um, exactly how much butterfat
is there in your low butterfat Brie?

54:07.786 --> 54:11.123
I think, um, like three or
four milligrams an ounce.

54:11.290 --> 54:13.917
Wow.
That's low!

54:14.084 --> 54:17.963
So, is that less than your
cholesterol-free Dutch Gouda back there?

54:18.130 --> 54:22.801
- I'll have to check.
- And a lactic acid, salt...

54:29.349 --> 54:31.393
Gotcha, Van Welker.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.104
Ready for dinner, son?
Ready, Dad.

54:34.271 --> 54:37.733
All right. Hand-held video
game, downstage right on the couch.

54:37.900 --> 54:40.944
Mitt and comic books here.

54:41.111 --> 54:44.198
- Galactic Gladiator. Whose are those?
- They're mine.

54:44.364 --> 54:48.118
You read comics? I thought you
were a 62-year-old in a kid suit.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.871
Yeah, well, I have to
hide 'em when I'm at home.

54:51.038 --> 54:55.083
If my dad sees 'em, he'll say somethin' stupid
like, "Morris, you're too smart to read comics."

54:55.250 --> 54:58.921
Remember, Mud, just 'cause you're smart
doesn't mean you can't act stupid.

54:59.087 --> 55:01.340
It's your constitutional
right, young man.

55:01.507 --> 55:03.842
Okay.
For tonight's menu,

55:04.009 --> 55:06.053
chicken, lima beans!

55:06.220 --> 55:08.388
Lima beans?
Ha.

55:08.555 --> 55:11.183
- Sorry, I don't eat lima beans.
- Sorry, pal.

55:11.350 --> 55:15.229
It's our green vegetable. We gotta convince
the lovely doctor that your daddy...

55:15.395 --> 55:17.481
is taking good care
of you, Morris.

55:17.648 --> 55:21.276
The reason I came to camp was to get away
from computers and lima beans, so forget it!

55:21.443 --> 55:23.070
I'm not gonna eat it.

55:23.237 --> 55:25.489
- I don't have time to argue.
- Too bad.

55:25.656 --> 55:27.741
- How 'bout a buck a bean?
- What?

55:27.908 --> 55:30.035
One dollar for every bean you eat.
Ten beans, ten bucks.

55:30.202 --> 55:32.329
- No. - Come on! That's more than
the government pays farmers...

55:32.496 --> 55:34.373
- ...not to grow 'em.
- Fine.

55:34.540 --> 55:36.291
- Good!
- Great!

55:36.458 --> 55:37.334
Hello?

55:37.501 --> 55:39.336
- Remember, we're a happy family.
- I'm happy!

55:39.503 --> 55:40.754
- We're up!
- I'm up.

55:40.921 --> 55:42.130
- We're positive.
- I'm positive!

55:42.297 --> 55:44.383
- We're making eye contact.
- Fine!

55:44.550 --> 55:47.511
- Anybody home?
- Come in.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.305
Hi.

55:50.472 --> 55:52.683
- Good evening.
- Hi.

55:52.850 --> 55:55.352
- Boy, this chicken is really great.
- Great lima beans, Dad.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.896
- 63.
- Wow!

55:58.063 --> 56:00.649
I've never seen a kid with such a taste
for lima beans. This is amazing.

56:00.816 --> 56:02.776

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.978
Let's hit the switch. Go signs, go actors.
Dennis, you are up.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:16.731
Exit Savage.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:19.150
Enter Grotowski.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.993
Direct hit.
Ready for drama camp.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:36.167
Hey! This is my goddamn house and
I'll talk any goddamn way I want to!

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:41.464
Now, Stanley! There's no call to
use such language to Blanche.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:45.426
No,
no, Eileen, Stanley is animal,

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.678
savage!

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:51.265
What, what? Can you not
see I am with children?

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.602
Bob Spiegel, Arnold's father. We're
looking for the production of Annie.

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:58.189
This is Tennessee
for Tots Workshop.

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:00.358
Theater is down the hill.

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:02.944
You must hurry.
You are late.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:08.032
- Late? Parents' Day starts at noon.
- Nine!

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:13.204
- Arnold told me noon!
- Hurry!

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.915
Tennessee to H.Q.,
the Spiegels have landed.

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:28.386
God, I hate these horse shows!

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.304
This is theater camp, dear.

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:32.890
Two theater bogies
on final approach.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:37.395
- Talk 'em in, Amber.
- Ready sound, ready chorus, ready, Walter.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:41.232
- Damn it, how did you screw up the time?
- She distinctly said it was noon!

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:43.860
I'm sorry, the place is packed.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:46.612
But I'll let you in the side door
so you can watch from the wings.

01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:52.326
Go!

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:53.661
Roger that.

- Loved that opening number.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:50.927

Theater parents, gone. Move Annie out.
Everything.

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:07.693
Raise the dummies, hurry!
Raise the Christmas tree.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.821
Don't forget the snow. We've gotta
clean out the room for fat camp.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:12.865
Hurry! Hurry!

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.119

our famous chocolate cake!

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.768
- Where are the C-rations?
- Right here.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:44.063
- How's your dad?
- Miserable. He hates liverwurst.

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.065
Thanks.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:50.778
Oh, my God!
Mom?

01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:55.241
- Oh, my God, you are so skinny!
- Really, I can explain.

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.910
You see, it...
I'm what?

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:01.080
Look at you, you're bony. What,
did you lose 10, 15 pounds?

01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:04.000
- Here, turn around. Let me look at you.
- Mom, Mom stop!

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.002
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be in the islands.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.254
I missed you.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:11.590
- What? - Well, look at you,
you're practically svelte.

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:15.678
Yeah.

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:19.974
- Mom?
- Hmm?

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:23.352
- I'm really glad you came.
- Me too.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:26.272
- You want a piece of chocolate cake?
- Sure.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.402
Hey, Dad,
how're you holdin' out?

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:34.113
Freezing my nuts off!

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.406
Well, you can thaw 'em out later.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:38.701
We got a cease fire till 12:45, so I
snuck some lunch through the lines.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:39.618
All right.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.412
- Hey, watch out!
- What? What?

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:44.206
Oh, a decoy.
Here.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:47.585
Oh, man, that looks good.
Thanks.

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:56.469
I give up!

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:02.266
- Mom? What?
- Sorry to wake you, Officer.

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:04.935
T.R. Polk,
Bulldog Collections.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:09.482
Trying to get a line on a 1979
Gremlin, Caribbean yellow.

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:12.860
That's strange.
So am I.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.530
Is that so?

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:19.909
Tell me, you happen
to know this guy?

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.787
Mr. Polk, I think we have
something to talk about.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:28.459
- This is ridiculous!
- Dad!

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.545
Duck!

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:35.007
Have a good one!

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.761
Loads on the road.
Go.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:42.973
- All right, fat parents are
clear. What's next? - Hurry up!

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.976
We have 16 minutes to pull the switch.
This is the big one.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:48.187
Alright, go, go, come on!
Change to the last sign.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.523
Check.

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:52.733
Fire.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.903
- Hurry, Tim!
- Got it!

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.951
- Uh-oh.
- We got trouble. The sign's stuck!

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.203
We got a snafu at the sign, Mud.

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:06.831
We're in big trouble!

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:08.999
Go, go!
Come on, Jill.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.335
- Pull!
- It's stuck!

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:15.047
We'll be there in a couple of minutes.
I knew we could do it in two hours.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:16.924
Talk to me, Amber.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.885
- How much time do we have?
- 15 seconds.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:23.013
Pete, Tim, do something!

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:25.432
Tim, it's over!
We're dead!

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:26.350
Whoa!

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:30.020
The sign's clear.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.314
We may have lost Jill.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.359
Oh, boy.

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:37.278
Let's go!

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:40.823
You see, 82.5 miles.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.242
The nerds are here.
Over.

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:48.247
I just don't understand
how we messed up the time.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:51.417
- I thought it started at 5:00. - Like I
said, mega-regrets for the time confusion.

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:54.170
You can still catch
the end of our demo.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:59.508
This is our computer center. We have 60
substations linked to our Cray 3000.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:02.636
- Okay, we're cracking codes.
- Entry codes of course.

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:06.515
- We're into Pineview.
- Let's see what we can do in mode yellow.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:10.019
- What are you doing, boys?
- Mode yellow?

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:13.230
Is this Pineview...
Air Force Base?

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:16.817
"Status confirm.
Yes or no?"

01:18:16.984 --> 01:18:19.111
- Yes! - Yes! - No!

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:21.655
Okay, let's scramble the jets.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:27.578
- Good Lord, what is happening here?
- Relax, it's not a real alert.

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:30.915
They can't crack Pentagon codes.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:36.503
Can you?

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.971
Incoming!

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.974
Well, that
concludes our demonstration.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.353
We have to perform some,
uh, routine maintenance.

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:55.481
Don't worry. Everything's
gonna be all right.

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:58.734
Dennis will fix it. I just think I
should stay here and help him out.

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:02.279
- No problem. We'll be waiting
out in the car. - Good idea.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:05.491
Good-bye.
Thanks for coming.

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:08.285
We have to report back
to the interrogation tent.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:12.831
Well, I-I-I-I'd like
to go, Son,

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:17.628
but I've got a busy day tomorrow:
a few meetings, dry cleaners.

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:21.382
- I'll see you when you get home from camp.
- Okay.

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.194
It's a fine camp.

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:44.196
I had a great time.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:57.251
Don't worry. I read in Newsweek some
14-year-old kid cracked the AT&T computers.

01:19:57.418 --> 01:20:02.089
- Now he gets 100,000 a year as a
security consultant. - Excuse me, folks.

01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:04.967
You haven't, by any chance,
seen this man, have you?

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.345
You mean Mr. Wozniak?

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:16.270
Okay, he was
right... here.

01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:36.582
Huh?

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:17.623
Dennis Van Welker?

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.170
Morris?

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:26.256
Hi, Dad.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:37.393
Where's Van Welker, kid?

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:40.562
Uh, I seriously,
truthfully do not know.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.398
Mr. and Mrs. Himmel.

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:48.362
This kid says Van Welker's got
a cabin down by the lake, sir.

01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:52.074
- Ricky!
- Huh. He tortured me.

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:55.411
Send somebody to get him. I want to
talk to this Van Welker clown, pronto!

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:56.870
Yes, sir.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.456
Mr. and Mrs. Himmel,

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:03.043
how much weight
did your son actually lose?

01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:12.761
Dennis, they're coming
after you, Dennis. Look, the cops!

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:15.973
I mean, the moms are going crazy
and the kids are getting worried!

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.767
- Whoa-oh, slow down!
- What are we gonna do?

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:22.229
Mud, I can't really speak for "we."
I can only speak for "me."

01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:26.150
And "me" is getting out of here just
as fast as my Goodyear radials can go.

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:28.402
Dennis, this is serious.

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:31.572
Yes, it is.
A lot more serious for me than for you.

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:36.535
You're a kid! What can they do?
Spank you? Ground you?

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:38.954
If they ground me, Mud,

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:41.874
it's gonna be
in a concrete room,

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.129
with a vertical bar motif
and a 200-pound fiancee named Duke.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:52.801
- Dennis, you can't just leave.
- Look, Mud, it's gonna be okay.

01:22:55.721 --> 01:23:00.100
Here's what you do: get lost, vanish
into the woods for five, six hours.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:03.270
When you show up, they'll be so glad
you hadn't been eaten by bears,

01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:05.397
they'll let
the other stuff slide.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:10.194
- I guess.
- Guaranteed!

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.571
It'll be like
a movie-of-the-week!

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:14.323
Okay.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:21.747
Mud, sit down a minute.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.876
I'm sorry things
didn't work out, Mud.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.547
Sometimes the windmill
of the gods...

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:33.717
casts us up to the stars.

01:23:33.884 --> 01:23:36.762
Sometimes it flings us
down into the dirt.

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:51.151
Au revoir,

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:53.237
mon ami.

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:05.624
See ya.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:23.100
- Hey, Mud.
- Dr. Dunbar.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:26.186
How come you're not at camp?

01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:28.939
- Camp's over, we got busted.
- Yeah, I know.

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:32.776
Where's Dennis?

01:24:32.943 --> 01:24:35.362
The police are looking for him.
I mean, if they catch him...

01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:37.739
Yeah, he'll be held responsible.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:42.452
So, let me guess.
He took off.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:49.376
So, what are you doing here?

01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:53.130
Uh, I don't know. I just thought I'd
hang out here in the woods for a while.

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:54.715
Right, right.

01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:57.676
Till your parents were so worried about you
they wouldn't think about punishing you.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:01.263
Something tells me
that wasn't your idea.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.185
Been planning this
for five, six years.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:09.813
The camp idea was perfect!

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.816
Find kids with access to cash,

01:25:12.983 --> 01:25:17.446
get 'em away from their
parents, lots of junk food.

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:22.326
Win their confidence, then start
with the religious indoctrination.

01:25:22.492 --> 01:25:25.954
- He didn't take off.
- No, I guess he didn't.

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:28.624
His title was "Most High
And Holy Worship."

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.543
Rama Sri Havagnoli.

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:35.255
- That's H-A-V-A...
- Nice try, Dennis.

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:38.759
Look, you guys,

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:41.219
this whole thing wasn't
his idea; it was my idea.

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:46.141
Ah, yes.

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:50.812
The Himmel child, very gullible.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:55.317
He fell hook, line and sinker.
Show 'em your tattoo, Mud.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:57.486
Okay, Dennis, you can drop it.

01:25:57.653 --> 01:25:59.905
Look, if it was your idea,
where's the money?

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:03.158
Ah, yes, it's hidden.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:08.872
In my sock?

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.752
Look, Officer, I-I-I don't
know what's going on,

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:16.380
b-b-but I know my boy Morris
is a good boy...

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:20.717
- Dad, you don't know. - He's too
smart to get involved in anything.

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:24.012
Dad, just 'cause I'm smart
doesn't mean I can't act stupid!

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:31.687
Well, if Mud's guilty, I am too.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.692
Me too.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:41.488
I'm smart enough to act stupid.

01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:43.865
Yeah, and I'm stupid too!

01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:47.828
Well, you know what I mean.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:16.690
I can't believe nobody's pressing charges.
This guy's gonna walk.

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:20.277
Not necessarily. He still owes
me 2,800 bucks in penalties.

01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:23.238
Who do I see about
gettin' a bench warrant?

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:26.533
Excuse me, Mr. Polk. About the money Dennis
owes you, I think this will cover it.

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:34.082
- You're a little short.
- Well, you're a little fat.

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:40.297
Besides, I mean, come on, if you sue him, what are
you gonna get, a couple Winston Churchill albums?

01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:46.762
- Please? Come on.
- I could write it off against expenses.

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:50.140
T.R. Polk retires
with a perfect record.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:52.768
Hey, Mud!

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:57.022
- If you're ever in Boca, don't look me up.
- I'll do that.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:05.197
- Guess I messed up pretty bad, huh?
- You messed up big time.

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:09.242
Anyway.

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:12.829
I, uh, I brought you something.

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:16.124
- Galactic Gladiator?
- September issue.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:19.377
- He battles the, uh, Jupiter Squad.
- Yeah.

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:23.465
- Cool!
- Yeah, it is pretty cool.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:26.384
By the way, you're
grounded until you're 30.

01:28:28.595 --> 01:28:31.014
Yeah, I know.

01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:33.016
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:36.853
Hey, Mudster. What
do you think of my new wheels?

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:40.106
Hey, it looks great! Zack,
you're giving away your new car?

01:28:40.273 --> 01:28:42.108
Just till I graduate.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:44.402
Zack, you're not dropping out?

01:28:47.697 --> 01:28:50.617
Gotta be there for
The Greatest Love of All.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:53.787
Hey, Mud!

01:28:53.954 --> 01:28:56.039
Dennis!

01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:58.625
Well, Mud, I hope you've learned
something from all this.

01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:01.837
- Yeah, I probably did.
- Good.

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:05.632
- When you figure it out, you will
let me know, won't you? - Mm-hmm.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:11.388
- It was a great summer, Dennis.
- I kind of enjoyed it too.

01:29:11.555 --> 01:29:12.764
Thanks.

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:16.226
Your parents okay
about all this?

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:18.854
Yeah, my dad's just glad I
didn't get arrested, you know?

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.857
Wouldn't look good
on my college application.

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:24.651
Now all they have to worry
about is coming up...

01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:27.529
with $20,000 a year
to send you there.

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:31.700
$20,000?

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.412
You see, Mud...

01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:37.706
- ...you really do have...
- Potential?

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.666
- Maybe next summer.
- I'll call you.

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:45.547
- Trish?
- Oh, hi, Daddy.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.300
Don't you think that Zack should
wait here for his own parents?

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:51.094
Uh, couldn't he ride with us?

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:53.096
Please?

01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:57.934
- Come on, Zack.
- Sure, Mitch.

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.688
Hey, Mud.

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:04.441
Well, thanks for a great summer.

01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:16.536
- Ow! Wha...
- You promised! Only ex-geeks.

01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:19.706
I know, I know.
I'm... sorry.

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:26.046
Well... bye.

01:30:26.212 --> 01:30:28.840
Bye.

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.893
- Dennis!
- Huh?

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:43.271
I'm just proud of him, that's all.
Tough to watch my boy grow up, though.

01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:50.570
Uh, bye. - Bye

01:30:50.737 --> 01:30:52.781
- I'll see you. Bye.
- Bye.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:55.283
- Bye!
- Bye.

01:30:56.534 --> 01:30:58.536
Adios.

01:30:58.703 --> 01:31:01.790
