00:00.134 --> 00:01.680
Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:01.984 --> 00:04.953
- Young Money, baby!
- Oh, my god!

00:05.138 --> 00:07.105
That's totally insulting.
You know that, right?

00:07.140 --> 00:08.273
- You don't like Lil Wayne?
- Whatever.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.141
I'll see you later.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.741
- Were you offended?
- Not really.

00:11.742 --> 00:13.161
I get why people are upset,

00:13.172 --> 00:14.779
but I don't let stuff
like that get to me.

00:14.874 --> 00:16.907
Come on. College isn't
supposed to be a safe space.

00:16.943 --> 00:20.811
I'm tired of not having a voice.

00:22.849 --> 00:25.683
You suck. You're a
freaking embarrassment.

00:25.718 --> 00:27.752
Get off my field right now! Get off!

00:27.787 --> 00:29.754
Why are there cotton balls everywhere?

00:29.789 --> 00:31.689
Because somebody's trying
to put us in our place.

00:31.724 --> 00:32.756
White girl gets intimidated,

00:32.792 --> 00:33.758
the guy gets expelled.

00:33.793 --> 00:35.593
The entire Black Student Union

00:35.628 --> 00:37.628
gets intimidated, three-day suspension.

00:37.664 --> 00:39.697
Dean Peterson and I reviewed the case.

00:39.732 --> 00:41.966
We just couldn't prove intent.

00:42.001 --> 00:44.969
- So you're hunger-striking?
- I'm camping in front of the BSU

00:45.004 --> 00:47.905
and refusing to eat until
those guys are expelled.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.907
We won't go! We won't go!

00:49.942 --> 00:52.810
- All right, that's enough!
- We won't go! We won't go!

00:52.845 --> 00:54.779
Hey!

00:54.814 --> 00:55.913
- Hey! Let her go!
- Hey!

00:55.948 --> 00:57.782
Hey! We're just standing here! Hey!

00:57.817 --> 01:00.685
I'm okay.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.720
- We won't go!
- We won't go!

01:02.755 --> 01:04.688
We won't go! We won't go!

01:05.259 --> 01:06.975
_

01:12.632 --> 01:15.566
Hi, Sharee. I'm Richard Peterson,
Dean of Student Well-Being.

01:15.601 --> 01:18.636
I thought... Professor Marillo was...

01:18.671 --> 01:20.671
I'm the Associate Dean.

01:20.707 --> 01:22.506
Oh.

01:23.643 --> 01:24.909
Hi.

01:24.944 --> 01:26.844
So, I hear we had some
trouble on campus today.

01:28.548 --> 01:30.481
I didn't mean to push you.

01:30.516 --> 01:32.750
I'm so sorry about that.

01:32.785 --> 01:34.819
What happened at your
last school, exactly?

01:34.854 --> 01:35.920
You dropped out?

01:37.890 --> 01:38.856
It didn't work out.

01:40.693 --> 01:42.626
And I needed to be closer to my mom.

01:42.662 --> 01:44.795
And I'm sure you don't want to go
through two schools in one year.

01:44.831 --> 01:47.732
I don't intend to drop
out. I like it here.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.533
Really?

01:49.569 --> 01:51.669
Hmm... Doesn't seem like it.

01:51.704 --> 01:53.571
It was a peaceful protest.

01:53.606 --> 01:55.940
And student protest is fine.

01:55.975 --> 01:57.875
We just can't allow violence.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.877
Again, it was an accident.

02:01.514 --> 02:03.781
But there are real
issues here on campus.

02:05.485 --> 02:06.851
Am I in trouble?

02:08.788 --> 02:10.721
Well, you've got good grades
and you've had a hard road,

02:10.757 --> 02:12.623
so we're going to give
you a pass on this one.

02:12.658 --> 02:15.659
But I do not want to see
you in this office again.

02:15.695 --> 02:16.761
We both expect your enrollment here

02:16.796 --> 02:19.663
at UMKC to be problem-free
from here on out.

02:19.699 --> 02:22.533
- Are we understanding each other?
- I understand.

02:22.568 --> 02:24.502
- Okay.
- Thank you.

02:24.537 --> 02:25.936
Both of you.

02:31.577 --> 02:34.478
I'm reaching out to the Asian
and Latino student associations

02:34.514 --> 02:35.813
to try to get their support.

02:35.848 --> 02:36.914
Great. Keep it up.

02:38.851 --> 02:40.751
- Mm, not this one. Let's go with the other one.
- Uh-huh.

02:41.921 --> 02:43.788
These just came in.

02:47.894 --> 02:49.760
Love it.

02:50.930 --> 02:52.730
Look at these!

02:52.765 --> 02:55.699
And I've contacted all
the campus bloggers.

02:55.735 --> 02:57.501
Hopefully, somebody
bites for an interview.

03:00.573 --> 03:01.572
Hey, you're back.

03:02.608 --> 03:04.542
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

03:04.577 --> 03:06.544
Listen, if you aren't cool
being here for whatever reason...

03:06.579 --> 03:08.879
I'm fine. What's this?

03:15.955 --> 03:17.822
Whatever you're doing,

03:17.857 --> 03:18.923
count me in.

03:37.944 --> 03:40.845
Number one, we demand
the immediate expulsion

03:40.880 --> 03:42.880
of the students who are
behind the hate crime

03:42.915 --> 03:44.782
in front of the Black Student Union.

03:44.817 --> 03:47.785
Number two, we demand the
number of black students

03:47.820 --> 03:49.954
and black faculty be
increased by ten percent.

03:49.989 --> 03:51.789
What about increased scholarship?

03:51.824 --> 03:53.891
Black people guaranteed on
every decision-making board?

03:53.926 --> 03:54.925
And the curriculum.

03:54.961 --> 03:56.861
Their history is a requirement.

03:56.896 --> 03:58.896
Ours should be a requirement,
too, instead of an elective.

03:58.931 --> 04:00.831
I don't think we can mandate that.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.433
- Why not?
- And what happened

04:02.468 --> 04:03.801
to renaming the Sherman building?

04:03.836 --> 04:05.903
- We decided not to include that.
- Who decided?

04:05.938 --> 04:07.705
A group of us.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.441
We decided that if there are too
many demands, it gets diluted.

04:10.476 --> 04:12.743
We won't get taken seriously.
People will make fun of us.

04:12.778 --> 04:14.778
Yo, I don't give a damn
about what people say.

04:14.814 --> 04:16.814
They named a building
after a slave owner.

04:16.849 --> 04:17.848
That is documented.

04:17.884 --> 04:19.850
But nobody thinks about
that when they walk by.

04:19.886 --> 04:22.720
It's just a sign on a door.
It doesn't impact our lives.

04:22.755 --> 04:23.854
No, it does impact us.

04:23.890 --> 04:25.789
It makes us inconsequential.

04:25.825 --> 04:27.758
It tells us that the money he gave

04:27.793 --> 04:29.793
was more important than
whose backs he made it on.

04:29.829 --> 04:31.762
I understand that,
but it's just a symbol.

04:31.797 --> 04:33.831
- Symbols matter.
- Damn right they do.

04:33.866 --> 04:36.767
But we have to be realistic,
and it's more important to get

04:36.802 --> 04:39.937
money for jobs and resources
than a stupid building renamed.

04:39.972 --> 04:41.839
Yeah? We deserve it all.

04:41.874 --> 04:43.807
- Mm-hmm!
- You're damn right!

04:43.843 --> 04:46.477
Uh, Iris?

04:46.512 --> 04:48.812
We did something like
this at my high school,

04:48.848 --> 04:50.848
trying to keep it deaf
and limit the number

04:50.883 --> 04:52.917
of hearing students allowed in.

04:52.952 --> 04:55.886
In my experience, it's not a bad idea

04:55.922 --> 04:59.423
to ask for more than you're
willing to settle for.

05:03.829 --> 05:04.862
All right.

05:04.897 --> 05:07.765
I'll ask for the Sherman building

05:07.800 --> 05:09.867
to be renamed after a person of color.

05:09.902 --> 05:11.869
No, you demand, not ask.

05:11.974 --> 05:14.875
Demand.

05:14.910 --> 05:16.777
Okay, listen up.

05:16.812 --> 05:18.946
Dean Peterson is required
to review any petition

05:18.981 --> 05:20.948
that gets at least 1,000 signatures.

05:20.983 --> 05:24.518
Now, that sounds like a
lot, but there's a lot of us.

05:24.553 --> 05:26.954
Deadline is tomorrow by 6:00 PM.

05:26.989 --> 05:29.523
If we miss this, we'll
have to wait until

05:29.558 --> 05:30.958
next semester's administrative review,

05:30.993 --> 05:32.860
so time is essential.

05:32.895 --> 05:36.830
Plus, I'm not eating until
he gives in, so please hurry.

05:36.866 --> 05:38.899
Thank you!

05:43.873 --> 05:47.941
Excuse me? Can I talk to you
about racism on this campus?

05:47.977 --> 05:49.843
Hi, do you have a
minute to sign a petition

05:49.879 --> 05:51.845
asking Dean Peterson to
review demands from the...

05:51.881 --> 05:55.883
- Hi, can I talk to you...
- I got to get to class. Sorry.

05:55.918 --> 05:57.918
Of course you do.

05:57.953 --> 05:59.920
- What's this about?
- Hi. Thanks for stopping.

05:59.955 --> 06:02.790
This is a petition asking
the Dean of Student Well-Being

06:02.825 --> 06:05.759
to make some changes about how
students of color are being treat...

06:05.795 --> 06:06.794
You want to force them to hire

06:06.829 --> 06:08.796
unqualified professors
because they're black?

06:08.831 --> 06:11.632
And what, fire white professors
just because they're white?

06:11.667 --> 06:13.634
Wait, no. Not at all.

06:13.636 --> 06:15.636
There are plenty of
qualified black professors,

06:15.671 --> 06:16.704
and no one's getting fired.

06:16.739 --> 06:19.507
This is reverse racism.
You know that, right?

06:19.542 --> 06:21.509
Demanding special
privileges, extra money,

06:21.544 --> 06:22.610
just because of the color of your skin?

06:23.946 --> 06:25.479
Are you kidding me?

06:39.862 --> 06:41.795
Hey, Sharee. Hi, Chris!

06:41.831 --> 06:43.831
Hey.

06:43.866 --> 06:45.799
So, you remember how we promised

06:45.835 --> 06:46.934
that you would have a driver every week

06:46.969 --> 06:48.001
so you could visit your aunt.

06:48.037 --> 06:51.705
So, this week, it's my
very own daughter, Bay.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.674
Yep.

06:53.709 --> 06:54.741
Oh, I'm sorry. I got to run.

06:54.777 --> 06:55.809
- You two okay?
- Good.

06:55.845 --> 06:57.678
Okay. Okay.

06:57.713 --> 07:00.481
So, I guess I'm gonna need your digits.

07:00.516 --> 07:02.549
- Hm.
- Dude, that's the coach's daughter.

07:02.585 --> 07:04.518
You might want to watch it.

07:04.553 --> 07:05.619
Yes, and my boyfriend,

07:05.654 --> 07:08.589
Travis, has already
told me a lot about you.

07:08.624 --> 07:12.860
So, yeah. I need a
half an hour's notice.

07:12.895 --> 07:14.528
I got to go. See you later, Sharee.

07:14.563 --> 07:15.963
- See you.
- Later, Bay.

07:15.998 --> 07:18.799
Can I ask you something?

07:18.834 --> 07:19.933
What's up?

07:23.873 --> 07:24.905
Some of us from the BSU are

07:24.940 --> 07:27.741
getting together to ask
Dean Peterson to address

07:27.776 --> 07:29.743
some concerns about how
we're being treated on campus.

07:31.814 --> 07:33.680
Nah. Not for me.

07:33.716 --> 07:35.816
What you mean, not for
you? You're not black?

07:35.851 --> 07:38.585
I can't afford my name
on stuff like this.

07:38.621 --> 07:41.522
We got our last game of
regionals in four days.

07:41.557 --> 07:42.990
Next stop, College World Series,

07:43.025 --> 07:44.558
then the Majors.

07:44.593 --> 07:46.527
You think you're above it
because you're an athlete?

07:46.562 --> 07:47.628
Pretty much.

07:47.663 --> 07:49.963
What's going on?

07:49.999 --> 07:51.899
Nothing. All good.

07:53.903 --> 07:55.969
See you around, Martin Luther King.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.843
Uh-uh. You can't be doing this here.

08:02.878 --> 08:04.645
I was just having a conversation.

08:04.680 --> 08:05.846
I don't want the athletes
bothered, all right?

08:05.881 --> 08:08.515
This is your work-study.
Leave it outside.

08:09.685 --> 08:11.685
Got it. Won't happen again.

08:27.536 --> 08:31.405
So, it turns out, I suck at
this whole activism thing.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.440
I stood outside for three hours.

08:33.476 --> 08:34.775
I only got 15 signatures.

08:34.809 --> 08:36.809
It's hard to get people
to stop what they're doing

08:36.846 --> 08:38.745
and listen to a stranger.

08:40.783 --> 08:43.717
- Hey, how's your mom doing?
- She's good.

08:43.751 --> 08:45.819
Not too thrilled about all this.

08:45.855 --> 08:48.589
Says I should focus on my schoolwork.

08:48.624 --> 08:51.525
Plus, this thing keeps freezing up on me

08:51.560 --> 08:52.693
'cause it's five years old,

08:52.728 --> 08:55.529
and I got two papers due on Friday.

08:55.564 --> 08:57.564
You know, this whole systemic
racial injustice thing

08:57.600 --> 09:00.400
is really putting a dent in my day.

09:05.441 --> 09:07.441
You know, when I was seven,

09:07.476 --> 09:09.810
I went to the state
fair with my parents.

09:09.845 --> 09:13.447
Standing in the ice cream
line, speaking Spanish...

09:14.850 --> 09:18.685
and the woman next
us told us to go home.

09:18.721 --> 09:20.654
And she was pretty upset with us.

09:20.689 --> 09:23.790
I was confused. I was wondering
why she wanted us to go home.

09:23.826 --> 09:26.593
- She meant wherever you came from.
- Mm.

09:26.629 --> 09:29.596
It's a very scary feeling
for a little kid to feel hate

09:29.632 --> 09:32.533
from a grown-up for
something you can't change.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.475
I was four when I was called
the N-word for the first time.

09:45.548 --> 09:46.847
Hm.

09:46.882 --> 09:49.449
It was a little girl at school.

09:50.753 --> 09:52.719
I don't think she knew what it meant.

09:52.755 --> 09:53.754
I know I didn't.

09:54.857 --> 09:57.591
So, I went home and I asked my dad.

10:00.796 --> 10:04.531
I had a history lesson
before I got out of preschool.

10:10.506 --> 10:13.473
Did you tell people that when
you asked them to sign it?

10:14.543 --> 10:17.544
How important it is
to you, how personal?

10:18.914 --> 10:20.814
I don't like to think about that stuff,

10:20.849 --> 10:21.848
let alone talk about it.

10:23.519 --> 10:24.885
I think you're gonna have to.

10:28.757 --> 10:30.691
So, you're telling me I
should go back out there?

10:30.759 --> 10:31.858
I'm telling you no one ever said

10:31.894 --> 10:32.859
it was gonna be easy.

10:35.698 --> 10:36.797
But it's worth it.

10:39.835 --> 10:43.604
You tell your story, people will listen.

10:43.639 --> 10:45.505
Hmm?

11:10.833 --> 11:13.767
Hi, my name is Sharee.
Sorry to interrupt.

11:13.802 --> 11:15.702
I need to speak to you...

11:26.782 --> 11:28.749
Where we at?

11:28.784 --> 11:30.584
803 signatures.

11:31.654 --> 11:33.453
That's it?

11:33.489 --> 11:34.588
That's it.

11:37.493 --> 11:38.592
800 is a lot.

11:38.627 --> 11:41.528
The policy is a thousand
or he won't consider them.

11:41.563 --> 11:43.897
We have to prove we
have campus-wide support.

11:43.932 --> 11:45.866
We have to ask for more time
or go in with what we have.

11:45.901 --> 11:47.801
- We'll look weak.
- Well, what do you want to do?

11:47.836 --> 11:50.470
- Sorry, I'm late.
- We don't have enough.

11:50.506 --> 11:51.938
- I have some. I have a bunch.
- How many?

11:51.974 --> 11:53.740
Three hundred and eleven!

11:53.776 --> 11:54.908
- Are you serious?
- What?

11:54.943 --> 11:56.677
How the hell did you do that?

11:56.712 --> 11:58.845
I stayed up all night. I went
to pizza parlors, fraternity row.

11:58.881 --> 12:01.648
My hands are freezing, but I got 'em.

12:01.684 --> 12:04.818
1,114 signatures!

12:04.853 --> 12:07.621
The demands are going in.

12:10.659 --> 12:13.527
Great job. You really
pulled through for us.

12:17.297 --> 12:19.039
_

12:28.071 --> 12:31.405
Hey, I saw that Starving4Change
is trending on Chat Bandit.

12:31.441 --> 12:33.941
I know! And did I tell you,

12:33.977 --> 12:36.944
I finally got a campus
blogger to meet with me.

12:36.980 --> 12:39.313
Uh... actually, I better get going.

12:39.349 --> 12:41.315
That's great. I'll stay
here, support the cause.

12:41.351 --> 12:43.184
Thanks.

12:53.099 --> 12:54.932
So, why a hunger strike?

12:54.968 --> 12:56.134
It feels a little extreme.

12:56.169 --> 12:58.970
Sometimes drastic measures are
needed to affect real change.

12:59.005 --> 13:01.873
Like when Alice Paul's
hunger strike helped win over

13:01.908 --> 13:03.841
public opinion for the
women's right to vote

13:03.877 --> 13:05.810
or when Cesar Chavez's hunger strike led

13:05.845 --> 13:08.846
to better wages and
rights for farm workers.

13:08.882 --> 13:10.815
And please get in that this is inspired

13:10.850 --> 13:12.784
by the Black Lives
Matter national movement

13:12.819 --> 13:15.787
and that it is not just about
things going on on this campus,

13:15.822 --> 13:17.121
but on campuses across this country.

13:17.157 --> 13:19.791
Uh, awesome. Thanks.

13:19.826 --> 13:20.258
It's great stuff.

13:23.263 --> 13:25.163
You're from Anchorage, right?

13:25.198 --> 13:28.099
- You grew up in Hillside?
- I did!

13:28.134 --> 13:31.002
My uncle works at Safeco Oil.
He's an engineer in the fields.

13:31.037 --> 13:34.071
I think he works for
your dad, uh... Luke?

13:34.107 --> 13:36.941
No way! Yeah, Luke
Watkins, that's my dad.

13:36.976 --> 13:38.876
Beautiful country up there.

13:38.912 --> 13:40.945
- It is.
- Well, uh, good luck.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.847
Okay. Thank you.

13:56.863 --> 13:59.197
Well, if it isn't the
princess of Hillside

13:59.232 --> 14:02.133
here to grace us disenfranchised
folk with her presence.

14:02.168 --> 14:04.101
What are you talking about?

14:05.839 --> 14:10.107
"While articulate, strong-willed
and passionate about her cause,

14:10.143 --> 14:12.210
it may be surprising to
learn that Watkins was born

14:12.245 --> 14:14.045
to a white father

14:14.080 --> 14:18.015
and attended an exclusive
private high school in a suburb

14:18.051 --> 14:22.887
where her family home is appraised
at almost a million dollars."

14:22.922 --> 14:25.056
So what? How is any of that relevant?

14:25.091 --> 14:26.924
You were raised white.

14:27.994 --> 14:28.993
Living a white life.

14:29.028 --> 14:30.828
My mom was black.

14:30.864 --> 14:33.231
You look like a fraud, which
means we look like frauds.

14:33.266 --> 14:36.234
This article makes us look like
a bunch of ungrateful whiners

14:36.269 --> 14:38.269
who freak out at the
first sign of adversity.

14:38.304 --> 14:40.137
Who cares that I grew up with money?

14:40.173 --> 14:42.240
It's not like it shields
you from racial injustice.

14:42.275 --> 14:45.142
Really? It doesn't
shield you from redlining?

14:45.178 --> 14:48.045
It doesn't shield you
from a piss-poor education?

14:48.081 --> 14:50.281
I am not gonna debate you
about which one of us blacker,

14:50.316 --> 14:53.150
especially not because
of one stupid article.

14:53.186 --> 14:55.152
Which you never should have done!

14:55.188 --> 14:57.154
You know the media's biased against us!

14:57.190 --> 14:59.123
Do you remember Hurricane Katrina?

14:59.158 --> 15:01.125
The press said that black
families were "looting" food,

15:01.160 --> 15:03.127
but white families were "finding" it.

15:03.162 --> 15:04.996
Don't lecture me.

15:05.031 --> 15:06.898
Mike Brown gets killed by the police,

15:06.933 --> 15:08.866
and they print the scariest
picture of him they can find.

15:08.902 --> 15:11.969
But that Boston Bomber
kid, who terrorized a city,

15:12.005 --> 15:14.413
gets his Facebook picture on
the cover of Rolling Stone.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.234
"Good kid gone bad."

15:16.239 --> 15:18.910
I never said I represented
every black person.

15:18.945 --> 15:20.845
You're the face of the movement!

15:20.880 --> 15:23.848
You have to have adversity in your past

15:23.883 --> 15:25.783
or no one will care about any of us!

15:26.886 --> 15:29.153
They want to write us
off in any way possible.

15:31.224 --> 15:33.190
You just gave them the perfect excuse.

15:38.131 --> 15:39.997
I think it's time I take over.

15:40.033 --> 15:43.000
What? I started this!

15:43.036 --> 15:46.003
I haven't eaten in days!
That's how committed I am.

15:46.039 --> 15:49.907
You are welcome to continue
the hunger strike if you want,

15:49.943 --> 15:51.075
but I am taking over.

15:53.112 --> 15:54.078
I got it!

15:54.113 --> 15:56.814
It's Dean Peterson's response.

15:59.786 --> 16:02.753
"Our school has always been
one of inclusion and diversity.

16:02.789 --> 16:05.222
The students associated
with the cotton ball incident

16:05.258 --> 16:07.792
have been disciplined in
accordance with school policy."

16:07.827 --> 16:09.160
Blah, blah, blah!

16:09.195 --> 16:10.761
What does that even mean?

16:10.797 --> 16:13.798
It means Dean Peterson ain't doing jack.

16:18.104 --> 16:20.137
I don't matter to them.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.174
They'll just let me starve to death.

16:24.243 --> 16:27.078
Peterson's doing nothing? Fine.

16:27.113 --> 16:29.046
But are we gonna stand
by and do nothing?

16:29.082 --> 16:31.082
- No!
- Hell no!

16:31.117 --> 16:33.017
- What do we want?
- Justice!

16:33.052 --> 16:34.919
- When do we want it?
- Now!

16:34.954 --> 16:36.921
- What do we want?
- Justice!

16:36.956 --> 16:38.022
- When do we want it?
- Now!

16:38.057 --> 16:39.957
- What do we want?
- Justice!

16:39.993 --> 16:41.826
- When do we want it?
- Now!

16:41.861 --> 16:42.960
- What do we want?
- Justice!

16:42.996 --> 16:44.862
- When do we want it?
- Now!

16:44.897 --> 16:46.897
- What do we want?
- Iris? Iris!

16:46.933 --> 16:49.266
- Now!
- Iris!

16:49.302 --> 16:51.235
- When do we want it?
- Get help!

16:51.270 --> 16:52.269
- What do we want?
- Justice!

16:52.305 --> 16:53.804
- When do we want it?
- Now!

17:02.226 --> 17:05.227
Look, thanks for coming, but I'm okay.

17:05.262 --> 17:08.163
We have pho, and chicken
noodle, clam chowder.

17:08.198 --> 17:09.131
No.

17:09.165 --> 17:10.232
Iris...

17:10.267 --> 17:13.034
please, this is serious.

17:14.204 --> 17:17.071
I'm not eating until the kids

17:17.107 --> 17:20.175
who put out the cotton
balls are expelled.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.978
Okay, but you heard
what the doctor said.

17:23.012 --> 17:25.981
Low blood pressure, ketoacidosis...

17:26.016 --> 17:27.949
these are things that can kill you.

17:27.984 --> 17:29.520
She's right. There's no world in which

17:29.521 --> 17:31.395
losing your life is a win for the cause.

17:36.326 --> 17:37.359
Say I eat.

17:38.929 --> 17:39.361
Then what?

17:40.397 --> 17:42.297
Nothing changes.

17:42.332 --> 17:45.333
I need to be as loud as possible.

17:46.370 --> 17:49.204
And this is the only way I know how.

17:49.239 --> 17:52.140
Until they're expelled, I'm not eating.

18:01.084 --> 18:04.152
No. Sit-ins and picket
signs are too passive.

18:04.188 --> 18:07.122
This ain't the '60s. People
will just walk past us.

18:07.157 --> 18:09.891
We need to do something
that Peterson can't ignore.

18:09.927 --> 18:12.327
- Like what?
- The Sherman building.

18:12.362 --> 18:14.896
I say we go over there
and tear that sign down.

18:14.932 --> 18:16.965
That's your big plan,
vandalizing school property?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.934
We do that and Peterson
can't ignore us any longer.

18:18.969 --> 18:20.268
He'll have to address the demands.

18:20.304 --> 18:22.871
We do that and we're criminals.

18:22.906 --> 18:25.340
It's civil disobedience.
I can live with that.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.876
You guys, are we overreacting?

18:27.911 --> 18:29.311
I mean, these things, they're little.

18:29.346 --> 18:31.279
Cotton ball pranks? Name calling?

18:31.315 --> 18:34.182
Should we be focusing
on... I don't know,

18:34.218 --> 18:36.251
health care, voter turnout,

18:36.286 --> 18:38.119
black-on-black violence?

18:38.155 --> 18:39.187
We will focus on all that.

18:40.257 --> 18:42.123
But this is our battle now.

18:42.159 --> 18:44.059
Those guys who put out the cotton balls,

18:44.094 --> 18:45.060
if they aren't given a message,

18:45.095 --> 18:47.095
if the whole school
isn't given the message,

18:47.130 --> 18:50.932
that we won't take it,
they'll just go on doing it.

18:50.968 --> 18:52.901
Sharee?

18:52.936 --> 18:54.035
You're sitting over there,
all quiet. What do you think?

18:55.305 --> 18:56.905
Um...

18:56.940 --> 18:58.840
I'm thinking about Iris,

18:58.876 --> 19:02.277
laying in bed, literally
putting her life on the line

19:02.312 --> 19:03.845
for black students to be heard.

19:05.883 --> 19:08.850
And then I'm thinking about
Peterson who couldn't care less.

19:11.288 --> 19:13.188
I'm thinking it's time we show them

19:13.223 --> 19:16.057
if they're not going to
change things, we will.

19:16.093 --> 19:17.225
That sign's coming down.

19:24.234 --> 19:26.935
Okay, Mr. Sherman,

19:26.970 --> 19:29.938
your time being celebrated
as a slave owner is over.

19:33.944 --> 19:35.944
You want to do the honors?

19:35.979 --> 19:37.345
I do indeed.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.188
This is for the time a professor
implied I wouldn't be here

19:47.224 --> 19:49.224
if it weren't for affirmative action.

19:58.302 --> 20:01.236
This is for the time the security
alarm went off at the bookstore

20:01.271 --> 20:05.073
and I was the only one who
was stopped and searched.

20:11.949 --> 20:15.050
This is for the time someone
gave me a lawn jockey as a joke.

20:22.426 --> 20:24.359
This is for those people who told me,

20:24.394 --> 20:27.395
"You're pretty... for a black girl."

20:37.174 --> 20:39.341
Hello?

20:39.376 --> 20:41.276
- What are you doing?
- It's my mom.

20:41.311 --> 20:43.244
I got to take this.

20:45.182 --> 20:47.215
Is that Marillo?

20:47.250 --> 20:50.151
I'm going to go talk to
her. You guys wait here.

20:50.187 --> 20:52.187
Professor Marillo, wait up!

20:54.124 --> 20:57.959
This is not the time... or the place.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.894
I just want to ask you a question.

20:59.930 --> 21:00.962
Can you please talk to me?

21:00.998 --> 21:03.031
This isn't appropriate!

21:03.066 --> 21:06.334
If you want to see me,
come during office hours!

21:06.370 --> 21:08.003
But I'm right here. Can we just talk?

21:09.306 --> 21:12.273
Can you just tell me why
you won't listen to us?

21:13.377 --> 21:16.211
Professor, wait! Please, just...

21:16.246 --> 21:18.213
Why won't you meet with us?

21:18.248 --> 21:20.181
Why are you ignoring us?

21:20.217 --> 21:22.183
Do you not believe us?

21:22.219 --> 21:24.285
You guys, get out of here.

21:26.223 --> 21:28.123
- What do we have to do...
- Keeshawn!

21:28.158 --> 21:29.257
We just want to talk!

21:29.292 --> 21:31.159
What are you doing? Let her go!

21:31.194 --> 21:33.094
Leave me alone!

21:33.130 --> 21:35.964
Wait!

21:35.999 --> 21:38.099
- Why would you do that?
- You can't do that because it's not the right way!

21:38.135 --> 21:40.035
Well, what is then?

21:43.106 --> 21:45.006
What is?

21:46.109 --> 21:47.976
I don't know.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.412
I don't know!

21:52.049 --> 21:52.981
God!

22:01.982 --> 22:03.102
_

22:10.915 --> 22:12.014
Mm-hmm.

22:12.049 --> 22:13.849
Yes, sir.

22:13.885 --> 22:14.950
You keep that up,

22:14.986 --> 22:17.019
you're gonna kill 'em tomorrow.

22:17.054 --> 22:19.922
Next stop, College World Series, baby.

22:19.957 --> 22:22.191
I'm still waiting on
some calls, but as of now,

22:22.226 --> 22:24.760
three scouts are gonna be there for you.

22:24.795 --> 22:26.762
Kid, your life is about to change.

22:26.797 --> 22:28.831
- Mm!
- Yeah!

22:37.174 --> 22:39.742
- What's up, legs?
- Hey.

22:39.777 --> 22:42.111
What's wrong? Still mad at me
'cause I didn't sign that thing?

22:43.214 --> 22:45.114
Hey, super star, how you doing?

22:45.149 --> 22:46.982
Ready for the game tomorrow?

22:47.018 --> 22:48.984
- Hey, I'm ready to get that W.
- Good.

22:49.020 --> 22:52.087
Sharee, here are the media
contracts for the game tomorrow.

22:52.123 --> 22:54.924
- Make sure Mike gets them, okay?
- Of course.

22:54.959 --> 22:56.959
Keep that positive attitude.
You're gonna do great.

22:56.994 --> 22:59.962
That's me. Mr. Positivity.

23:03.801 --> 23:04.800
Bye, legs.

23:16.814 --> 23:19.715
Chris. Chris, you can't play tomorrow.

23:19.750 --> 23:21.183
Say what now?

23:21.218 --> 23:23.155
Do you know how much
money is on the line

23:23.156 --> 23:24.330
for the school with this game?

23:24.789 --> 23:28.090
They're getting paid almost a
million dollars to broadcast it.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.092
Yeah. Can you believe
I get none of that?

23:31.195 --> 23:34.964
Look, I know this is a lot to ask,

23:34.999 --> 23:37.166
but if you and the rest of the
team threaten to sit out the game,

23:37.201 --> 23:39.034
Dean Peterson will have to meet with us.

23:39.070 --> 23:41.036
He'd never let the school
lose out on that much money.

23:42.076 --> 23:45.811
You want me to sit out the
biggest game of my life?

23:45.846 --> 23:48.881
My friend Iris is literally
starving herself for this cause.

23:48.950 --> 23:50.849
She is putting her life on the line.

23:50.885 --> 23:52.785
This game is my life.

23:52.820 --> 23:55.688
I've been working for this
since I was five years old,

23:55.723 --> 23:56.822
and I'm finally about to get paid.

23:56.857 --> 23:59.692
- This is bigger than you.
- Yeah, I know it is.

23:59.727 --> 24:03.128
I got an aunt, I got a little a
brother, I got people to take care of!

24:03.164 --> 24:04.730
And I'm not about to blow it

24:04.765 --> 24:06.699
to make some point
about some douche bags.

24:06.734 --> 24:09.068
You don't actually have to
sit out, just threaten it.

24:09.103 --> 24:11.036
He'll cave in, he has to.

24:11.072 --> 24:13.973
If you think I'm gonna take
that chance, you're crazy.

24:19.947 --> 24:22.014
This is becoming a powder keg situation.

24:22.049 --> 24:23.983
I think that we should take
this to President Hillard.

24:24.018 --> 24:25.017
Oh, absolutely not.

24:25.052 --> 24:27.617
Uh, it's my job to stop these issues

24:27.618 --> 24:29.045
before they become administration-wide.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.080
I told you a year ago
that more attention needs

24:31.115 --> 24:32.981
to be paid to these racial incidents.

24:33.017 --> 24:34.917
Now we have frustrated kids

24:34.952 --> 24:37.886
blocking professors'
cars, tearing down signs,

24:37.922 --> 24:39.021
just to try to get someone's attention.

24:39.056 --> 24:40.989
- Now, this is getting out of hand.
- Yeah, I agree!

24:41.025 --> 24:42.858
The behavior's unacceptable.

24:42.893 --> 24:44.860
And if Ms. Marillo will
let me know the name

24:44.895 --> 24:46.261
of the individual who
approached her last night...

24:46.297 --> 24:47.930
I don't know his name.

24:47.965 --> 24:50.766
And I only told you about
this to make you realize

24:50.801 --> 24:53.735
that ignoring this isn't
gonna make it go away.

24:53.771 --> 24:56.105
And what's this I hear about a
student who's hunger striking?

24:56.140 --> 24:57.206
What's that about?

24:57.241 --> 24:59.741
She's upset about the kids
who put the cotton balls

24:59.777 --> 25:00.209
in front of the BSU.

25:01.245 --> 25:02.211
We couldn't prove intent.

25:02.246 --> 25:04.179
We made them do sensitivity training.

25:04.215 --> 25:08.016
- They should've been expelled, Richard.
- Our job is to educate!

25:08.052 --> 25:09.918
Are we gonna ruin young people's lives

25:09.954 --> 25:10.986
over one error in judgment?

25:11.021 --> 25:13.989
Look, the least you can do,

25:14.024 --> 25:16.992
sit down with this young woman
who's on the hunger strike.

25:17.027 --> 25:19.928
- Make her feel heard.
- I would love to,

25:19.964 --> 25:22.764
but the fact is, we can't promise

25:22.800 --> 25:24.900
10% black faculty and 10% Latino

25:24.935 --> 25:26.835
and 5% Native American.

25:26.871 --> 25:28.203
That's not how you run a university.

25:28.239 --> 25:30.839
You strive to get the most
qualified people of course,

25:30.875 --> 25:32.774
but you can't mandate those things.

25:32.810 --> 25:35.177
And what, overhaul our
course load overnight?

25:35.212 --> 25:36.178
That's just naive.

25:37.815 --> 25:40.082
Look, I've heard your
concerns and thank you.

25:40.117 --> 25:41.150
This is my job to handle.

25:41.185 --> 25:43.051
Just let me handle it.

25:49.752 --> 25:54.090
_

25:54.091 --> 25:57.252
_

25:57.353 --> 25:59.365
_

26:08.979 --> 26:09.945
Damn.

26:25.262 --> 26:27.062
Hey!

26:27.097 --> 26:28.130
Stop right there.

26:28.165 --> 26:29.965
Hands in the air.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.968
- Hey, you wanna get that flashlight out of my face?
- Hands up right now.

26:33.003 --> 26:35.003
My key broke off in the lock.

26:35.039 --> 26:36.038
I'm a student here.

26:37.074 --> 26:38.874
Let me see some I.D.

26:43.981 --> 26:46.048
- I left my wallet upstairs.
- All right, turn around then.

26:46.083 --> 26:47.816
On your knees. Now.

26:47.851 --> 26:49.818
I swear, I'm a student here.

26:49.853 --> 26:52.754
Okay? You... Come upstairs.
You can get my wallet.

26:52.790 --> 26:53.855
I'm not stealing.

26:53.891 --> 26:55.891
This is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.

26:55.926 --> 26:58.126
Turn around and put your
hands on your head now.

26:58.162 --> 26:59.127
Now!

27:00.197 --> 27:01.196
Fine!

27:01.232 --> 27:03.098
Punk-ass cops.

27:06.136 --> 27:07.069
Get off me!

27:07.104 --> 27:08.103
Stop resisting!

27:08.138 --> 27:09.171
Stop resisting!

27:09.206 --> 27:11.039
Get off me! Help!

27:11.075 --> 27:12.174
But I didn't do anything!

27:12.209 --> 27:13.208
Hey, shut up!

27:13.244 --> 27:15.110
My pitching arm!

27:15.145 --> 27:17.112
You're hurting my pitching arm!

27:17.147 --> 27:19.114
What... what are you doing?

27:19.149 --> 27:21.049
Yo, help me! Call your dad!

27:21.085 --> 27:22.985
- What?
- He's under arrest.

27:23.020 --> 27:24.853
- Wait, for what?
- Bike theft!

27:24.888 --> 27:26.822
What? No! He's a student here!

27:26.857 --> 27:27.990
I know him! His name is Chris Walker!

27:28.025 --> 27:29.992
My boyfriend and I
can both vouch for him!

27:30.027 --> 27:31.893
My key broke in the lock!

27:31.929 --> 27:33.862
It's the red one! It was my bike!

27:33.897 --> 27:35.964
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27:36.000 --> 27:37.766
Here it is!

27:40.237 --> 27:41.203
I didn't see that key.

27:41.238 --> 27:42.838
You didn't ask!

27:47.878 --> 27:49.211
Hey, are you okay?

27:55.085 --> 27:56.051
I'm fine.

27:58.022 --> 27:59.121
Chris!

27:59.156 --> 28:00.956
I'm so sorry.

28:21.311 --> 28:22.411
Thanks.

28:27.312 --> 28:28.678
Look...

28:28.713 --> 28:31.247
my dad worked the
assembly line in Detroit.

28:31.282 --> 28:32.648
32 years.

28:32.684 --> 28:35.518
Showed up early, was
the last one to leave,

28:35.553 --> 28:37.453
took all the extra courses,
you know, just waiting

28:37.488 --> 28:38.654
to get promoted to manager.

28:38.690 --> 28:40.523
Never happened.

28:40.558 --> 28:41.657
Know who got tapped?

28:41.693 --> 28:43.526
Folks who looked more like

28:43.561 --> 28:45.528
what a supervisor looked
like in their eyes.

28:45.563 --> 28:48.464
From what I've seen, sitting by,

28:48.499 --> 28:50.466
waiting to be acknowledged doesn't work.

28:51.536 --> 28:53.302
You gotta take it.

28:57.375 --> 28:59.208
I'm the opposite of you.

28:59.244 --> 29:00.409
The good girl.

29:00.445 --> 29:02.378
Never breaking the rules.

29:02.413 --> 29:04.347
Well, not till now.

29:05.683 --> 29:07.316
Did you really grow up in Alaska?

29:07.352 --> 29:09.218
I really did.

29:09.254 --> 29:10.653
Any other black people around?

29:10.688 --> 29:12.188
Not too many.

29:12.223 --> 29:14.257
My mom died when I was nine.

29:14.292 --> 29:16.592
All of her relatives
live on the mainland

29:16.628 --> 29:19.195
and we saw them maybe once a year?

29:20.598 --> 29:22.498
I can't imagine growing up like that.

29:23.601 --> 29:25.601
My dad and my step-mom...

29:25.637 --> 29:27.536
they're amazing.

29:27.572 --> 29:29.438
They couldn't love me more.

29:29.474 --> 29:31.474
But I always felt different.

29:31.509 --> 29:33.509
Like an outsider in my own family.

29:35.346 --> 29:36.479
And you're right,

29:36.514 --> 29:40.383
you did have it harder
than me in a lot of ways.

29:40.418 --> 29:42.385
We never struggled for money.

29:42.420 --> 29:44.287
I was lucky,

29:44.322 --> 29:46.355
but in other ways, you had it easier.

29:46.391 --> 29:49.292
You always knew who you were...

29:50.361 --> 29:52.662
and...

29:52.697 --> 29:55.264
that's something I'm
still trying to figure out.

30:01.306 --> 30:04.540
You've got the rest of
your life to do that...

30:04.575 --> 30:06.709
but only if you have a life.

30:08.646 --> 30:10.579
You gotta eat, girl.

30:10.615 --> 30:12.515
This is not the way.

30:13.584 --> 30:14.583
I'm not eating.

30:14.619 --> 30:16.585
Iris.

30:16.621 --> 30:20.423
We'll find another way
to fight back. I promise.

30:20.458 --> 30:22.325
But this is too dangerous.

30:23.461 --> 30:25.328
Didn't you read the hashtag?

30:25.363 --> 30:26.495
Black lives matter.

30:29.467 --> 30:31.267
You matter.

30:31.302 --> 30:32.735
I know I do.

30:34.706 --> 30:37.373
And maybe by doing this,

30:37.408 --> 30:40.609
it'll show someone
how important this is.

30:48.653 --> 30:49.719
Respect.

31:10.341 --> 31:11.474
Champ.

31:11.509 --> 31:13.309
Time to warm up.

31:13.344 --> 31:15.311
Opening pitch in 15 minutes.

31:19.450 --> 31:21.417
I can't play, Coach.

31:21.452 --> 31:24.353
What are you talking
about you can't play?

31:24.389 --> 31:25.654
What's going on?

31:26.758 --> 31:29.291
I'm standing with the BSU.

31:29.327 --> 31:30.693
Chris, I really sympathize

31:30.728 --> 31:33.629
with what you went through yesterday,

31:33.664 --> 31:35.564
and we'll get into that later.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.533
We'll have those cops
reprimanded, we'll sue,

31:37.568 --> 31:39.268
we'll do whatever you
want, but right now,

31:39.303 --> 31:40.736
there are three scouts
sitting in the stands

31:40.772 --> 31:42.638
waiting to throw money at you.

31:42.673 --> 31:44.473
Money that you need.

31:44.509 --> 31:47.443
- And I want that money more than anything.
- Okay!

31:48.546 --> 31:50.479
But I gotta take a stand.

31:50.515 --> 31:52.515
I respect that. I get it.

31:52.550 --> 31:54.417
Guys, give me a second here.

31:57.455 --> 31:58.521
But sports are separate.

31:59.590 --> 32:02.324
Well, maybe they shouldn't be.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.428
I get that you're willing to
make this personal sacrifice.

32:05.463 --> 32:07.263
That's fine.

32:07.298 --> 32:08.364
Look around this room.

32:10.334 --> 32:12.301
What about your team? You owe them.

32:14.705 --> 32:16.705
I'm on more than one team.

32:37.595 --> 32:38.594
Guys.

32:38.629 --> 32:40.563
Hey, can I talk to you guys?

32:42.467 --> 32:45.501
Can you guys stop talking
for one second, please?

32:50.541 --> 32:53.375
Look, I know...

32:54.479 --> 32:58.247
I kind of been cocky since I got here,

32:58.282 --> 33:01.350
and I got no right to
ask you all for anything,

33:01.385 --> 33:04.220
but last night, I was assaulted

33:04.255 --> 33:05.387
by police on campus.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.692
They took me for a criminal.

33:09.727 --> 33:11.660
They pinned me to the ground,

33:11.696 --> 33:14.630
they kicked me in my back.

33:14.665 --> 33:17.500
I had no idea what they
were gonna do to me.

33:19.770 --> 33:22.571
Nobody should have to go through

33:22.607 --> 33:24.607
what I went through last night.

33:26.544 --> 33:28.577
Things like that happen every day

33:28.613 --> 33:31.413
to kids that look like me,

33:31.449 --> 33:32.615
and we aren't being heard.

33:34.485 --> 33:36.385
And so...

33:38.589 --> 33:42.458
I'm sitting out the game
today in hopes that we will be.

33:44.428 --> 33:48.397
And I know this is a huge ask, I do...

33:50.334 --> 33:53.202
but I hope you'll sit out with me too.

33:53.237 --> 33:55.271
Wait, that's crazy. Why?

33:55.306 --> 33:56.672
There's a bunch of scouts out there.

33:59.377 --> 34:00.676
This is my one chance.

34:10.344 --> 34:12.139
_

34:13.257 --> 34:14.690
He's sitting out the game

34:14.725 --> 34:17.592
because of the racial
incidents on campus.

34:19.530 --> 34:23.431
So... I need you to warm up.

34:24.467 --> 34:26.467
You are pitching.

34:41.069 --> 34:42.920
_

34:43.387 --> 34:44.687
Travis.

34:51.487 --> 34:53.545
_

35:07.712 --> 35:09.511
I'm with Chris.

35:15.453 --> 35:16.552
I'm sitting out too.

35:30.501 --> 35:32.334
Thank you.

35:33.371 --> 35:34.370
Thank you all.

35:39.377 --> 35:41.315
Is he crazy? John,
you gotta do something.

35:41.316 --> 35:42.848
You gotta get your team out there.

35:42.884 --> 35:43.916
We got camera crews!

35:43.952 --> 35:45.885
We've... we've got a
shot at doing something

35:45.920 --> 35:47.920
that has never been done in
the history of this school!

35:47.956 --> 35:49.288
Mike, I am very aware of that.

35:51.893 --> 35:53.226
I can't talk him out of it.

35:53.261 --> 35:56.195
- Why the hell not?
- Because they've made up their minds, Mike,

35:56.231 --> 35:58.231
and I'm their coach,

35:58.266 --> 36:00.099
and I'm gonna stand with my team.

36:00.134 --> 36:02.101
Has the world gone crazy?

36:02.136 --> 36:04.237
I'll tell you what, if
you want a team out there,

36:04.272 --> 36:06.239
you might want to make a call upstairs.

36:29.998 --> 36:31.998
What's going on? Why
aren't they starting?

36:32.033 --> 36:34.033
I have no idea.

36:35.870 --> 36:38.938
Two-minute warning for
UMKC to take the field!

36:44.279 --> 36:45.945
I'll find out what's going on.

36:48.670 --> 36:50.603
- Oh, my god.
- What?

36:50.638 --> 36:52.038
I think I know what's happening.

36:59.681 --> 37:01.948
Your team has 60
seconds to take the field

37:01.983 --> 37:03.583
or this game's a forfeit.

37:04.953 --> 37:05.918
They're gonna call, right?

37:05.954 --> 37:07.887
They're not gonna let us forfeit.

37:09.924 --> 37:10.957
Hey, Chris...

37:15.063 --> 37:17.763
You absolutely sure about this?

37:38.786 --> 37:39.785
Hey.

37:56.004 --> 37:57.904
This is insane! He's gotta give in!

38:02.911 --> 38:03.976
What did Peterson say?

38:05.980 --> 38:07.980
He said he's not gonna
be bullied by students.

38:11.019 --> 38:12.952
UMKC forfeits.

38:12.987 --> 38:14.854
East Indiana wins.

38:49.624 --> 38:51.624
I'm so sorry.

38:51.659 --> 38:53.559
I really thought it'd work.

38:54.629 --> 38:55.962
So did I.

38:57.632 --> 38:58.965
I'm glad you came.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.967
I'm in it now.

39:09.911 --> 39:10.910
Hey, everyone.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.946
Thanks for coming.

39:13.982 --> 39:18.918
I know it's been a hard
week, but this is not the end.

39:18.953 --> 39:20.820
I don't know what's next,

39:20.855 --> 39:22.021
but we'll figure it out.

39:23.825 --> 39:24.924
Did you hear?

39:24.959 --> 39:26.826
They're sitting out!

39:26.861 --> 39:27.927
- All of them!
- Who?

39:27.962 --> 39:30.830
Uh, lacrosse, uh, soccer, volleyball!

39:30.865 --> 39:31.831
What are you talking about?

39:31.866 --> 39:33.833
The other teams were
inspired by baseball!

39:35.837 --> 39:37.803
And they're all refusing to play

39:37.839 --> 39:39.905
until we get a meeting
with Dean Peterson.

39:39.941 --> 39:40.906
Wow.

39:40.942 --> 39:42.808
If football's in, we're golden!

39:42.844 --> 39:44.877
Yo, football is in!
Football, women's basketball,

39:44.912 --> 39:46.812
- uh, tennis, golf...
- Iris!

39:46.848 --> 39:49.815
Everybody's working with us!

39:49.851 --> 39:51.817
- You guys, this is exactly what we strive for.
- Hello?

39:51.853 --> 39:53.719
Everything that we
wanted, we are getting!

39:53.755 --> 39:55.655
- E... excuse me?
- These people are shutting down,

39:55.690 --> 39:56.756
and now they're gonna
have to listen to us!

39:56.791 --> 39:57.823
We did it, you guys!

39:57.859 --> 39:59.692
- Uh-huh.
- Everyone! Us!

39:59.727 --> 40:01.394
We finally got their attention...

40:01.429 --> 40:03.763
- Yeah. Yeah, it works for us.
- ... and now we're gonna finally get what we want!

40:03.798 --> 40:05.665
- Sure. Thank you.
- You understand?

40:05.700 --> 40:08.734
Because of the people
in this room, we did it!

40:08.770 --> 40:10.736
- That's why!
- Keeshawn!

40:10.772 --> 40:13.639
Everyone, please, can
I get your attention?

40:13.675 --> 40:16.075
That was the President
of the university.

40:18.046 --> 40:20.680
He expelled the guys who
put out the cotton balls.

40:20.715 --> 40:22.114
- Damn right!
- Uh-huh!

40:24.152 --> 40:25.718
Yes!

40:25.753 --> 40:28.054
And, um, there's more!

40:28.089 --> 40:31.157
He wants to meet with us tomorrow

40:31.192 --> 40:34.026
to address the rest of our demands.

40:36.164 --> 40:37.697
Yay!

40:43.171 --> 40:44.704
You did it.

40:46.174 --> 40:48.107
No, we did it.

40:50.678 --> 40:54.080
And I am taking everyone to dinner!

40:54.115 --> 40:55.614
Everyone?

40:55.650 --> 40:56.716
Everyone!

40:56.751 --> 40:58.084
- My brother!
- My brother!

41:01.122 --> 41:03.656
We're in. BSU!
