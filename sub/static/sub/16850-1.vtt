Previously
on Childrens hospital.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.440
(male #1)
'I wanna show you something.
Tell me what you think?'

00:06.474 --> 00:08.342
(male #2)
'Okay, ah, penis.'

00:08.376 --> 00:11.512
- 'Huh. Let's try another one.'
- 'Penis.'

00:11.545 --> 00:13.747
(male #1)
'Interesting. One more.'

00:13.781 --> 00:15.416
(male #2)
Penis.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.218
Very cool.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.054
[moaning]

00:20.088 --> 00:21.255
You're there,
you're there.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.224
- No.
- Oh, my god. Ha-ha-ha.

00:23.257 --> 00:26.194
Hi, I'm chief.
The chief surgeon.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.728
I can cure you.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.564
If he does that,
you might lose your sexy strip.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.467
I give you the new chief.

00:33.501 --> 00:36.404
I'm gonna try and cure you
the old-fashion way.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.472
Using the healing
power of laughter.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.342
Why don't you try
the healing power of medicine?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.111
I don't have a brain tumor.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.146
I couldn't think of
a reason to breakup.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.447
That's the brain tumor talking.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.682
I wanna operate
on your non-existing tumor.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.819
I extracted the tumor using only
the healing power of laughter.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.322
So, that was a success.

00:54.355 --> 00:57.158
And she died.
Sorry.

00:57.191 --> 01:02.396
You might say, I'm headed for a
bit of a nervous Blake Down.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.632
[buzz]
MD. Coming this fall.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.267
- How old is Nicky?
- Six.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.269
I like turtles.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.504
'He's got the rarest case of
advanced ageing disease.'

01:10.538 --> 01:12.573
Hi.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.209
(female #1)
'He got you pregnant.
It's immoral.'

01:15.243 --> 01:16.610
I'm disgusted.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.447
[laughing]

01:19.480 --> 01:21.315
Totally kidding.
It's fine.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.551
- How many names picked up?
- We're not telling anyone.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.353
Toby Maguire.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.821
[instrumental music]

01:31.392 --> 01:33.561
(thinking)
I dread the future.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.564
It's been so much
less experience than the past.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.167
I wish, I age backwards
like Merlyn.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.835
Or Bruce Springsteen
or anyone from the planet Ork.

01:41.869 --> 01:45.639
Some people say the past
is not past, or even over.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.542
Those people are pretentious.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.211
I see it everywhere..

01:50.244 --> 01:53.181
...the past
and it looks like Lola.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.551
Lola!

01:57.585 --> 02:00.688
Oh, but it's not her.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.291
It's never her,
because my best friend

02:03.324 --> 02:05.559
Dr. Lola Spratt is dead.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.463
(thinking)
But in my memory she lives.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.466
* It's no surprise

02:12.500 --> 02:14.168
* I'm here tonight

02:14.202 --> 02:15.669
(thinking)
But as time goes by

02:15.703 --> 02:17.838
even the memory of her face
becomes fuzzy.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.873
* Holding out hope

02:19.907 --> 02:23.344
* For a change in the tide

02:25.346 --> 02:26.680
But some days

02:26.714 --> 02:28.649
I can feel her with me.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.684
In the smile of a child

02:30.718 --> 02:34.322
or in the innocence of one of
God's more gentle creatures.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.525
Everything ends.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.894
But what do you call an ending
that begins all over again?

02:40.928 --> 02:43.364
A big ending.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.567
Alright-y.
Let's begin at the big ending.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.770
Hi, you must be Cat.
I'm so happy you could join us.

02:49.803 --> 02:53.541
Sorry, I'm late.
God, sarcastic much.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.377
I wasn't being sarcastic.
I'm thrilled that you're here.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.946
Wow, there was traffic.
I had my period.

02:58.979 --> 03:02.583
I totally understand that you've
got pain. Take the day off.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.752
Oh, my god,
are you done, Don Rickles?

03:04.785 --> 03:06.620
What's the deal
with this guy?

03:06.654 --> 03:08.756
Meet the new Fuhrer of
sci-middlemen.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.392
'He runs the insurance company
that owns the hospital now.'

03:11.425 --> 03:13.327
- Total suit.
- What does the chief think?

03:13.361 --> 03:15.363
'She doesn't care.
She's in love with him.'

03:15.396 --> 03:17.998
But pretending to hate him,
so that we think she's cool.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.234
Go back to your court-wrecked
penthouse cubicle

03:20.268 --> 03:21.435
Don Rickshaws.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.770
Ladies and gentlemen.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.406
We have got to find
new ways to raise revenue

03:25.439 --> 03:26.974
for this hospital.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.878
I'm so sorry.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.914
Some of my butterflies got out
of my collection this morning.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.385
He collects butterflies?
Typical suit.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.954
You know, what? Why don't we get
out there and save some lives?

03:40.988 --> 03:42.690
Wow.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.458
(female on speaker)
'Attention all staff.'

03:44.492 --> 03:47.828
'Buzzed surgery is the same
as drug surgery.'

03:47.861 --> 03:50.731
Chief, I'm so glad
I happen to run into you.

03:50.764 --> 03:54.001
I am glad that I happen
to run into you too

03:54.034 --> 03:55.836
by accident.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.904
Oh.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.376
Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, I got it.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.412
I'm on it.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.879
Sorry.
My staff hates you.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.915
So, I have to pretend
I hate you.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.551
That must be hard suddenly
not being the boss anymore.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.920
Say, last year,
I was riddled with muscular

04:12.953 --> 04:14.722
and neurological disease.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.591
I had an operation
that transformed me

04:17.625 --> 04:21.295
into the beautiful, healthy
creature you see before you.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.867
Ah. Here she comes.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.002
Yeah.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.305
Ha-ha.
I'm good with change.

04:31.339 --> 04:37.578
I'm also good at changing in and
out of various outfits.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.747
Costumes, if you will..

04:41.014 --> 04:43.083
Yeah, whoo!

04:43.116 --> 04:46.354
Huh. This is fun.
You want to do another pass?

04:46.387 --> 04:49.757
- Absolutely.
- Oh, my god, I almost forgot.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.326
There's something
extremely, extremely urgent

04:52.360 --> 04:53.827
I need to tell you.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.330
The future of this hospital
depends on it.

04:56.364 --> 05:00.601
Oh, my god. You tell me right
now, you son of a bitch.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.770
Don't leave me hanging.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.738
[dramatic music]

05:06.874 --> 05:09.577
(male narrator)
Coming up next
on Blake Downs, M.D.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.412
Dr. Downs has big news!

05:11.445 --> 05:14.748
I discovered a syndrome.
And they're naming it after me.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.650
Dr. Downs syndrome!

05:16.684 --> 05:18.919
You know what syndrome
they should name after you?

05:18.952 --> 05:21.489
The "never-makes-the-bed
syndrome".

05:21.522 --> 05:22.923
The New York Times says

05:22.956 --> 05:25.025
this show will never
get cancelled.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.927
Watch Blake Downs, M.D.
tonight.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.562
After Children's Hospital.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.001
Hey-hey-hey! And how is
Morgan's terminal cancer?

05:34.034 --> 05:36.537
- I'm not feeling very good.
- Great.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.507
Well, my medical advice
would be keep on trekking.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.480
Got you, you son of a bitch!

05:48.949 --> 05:50.884
[kissing the butterfly]

05:52.786 --> 05:54.722
I'm hungry.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.690
Hungry?

05:56.724 --> 05:58.426
[needle creaking]

05:58.459 --> 06:00.027
[beeping once]

06:00.060 --> 06:02.129
Gimme that thing.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.899
[dramatic music]

06:05.933 --> 06:09.470
(male over speaker)
'Attention! Now that I have your
attention, that is all.'

06:09.503 --> 06:12.105
Hi! We were at Deli
Cheese Cake factory

06:12.139 --> 06:14.942
- I had a accident.
- I quit. Get another nanny.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.510
Not this again.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.812
Look, Gladys, I'm sorry
if you have a problem

06:18.846 --> 06:20.414
with our unconventional
relationship.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.015
I don't care about that.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.652
I've dated plenty of guys,
25 years younger than me.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.887
Really? Did they have advanced
aging disease like Nicky?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.757
Don't think anybody has advanced
aging disease like Nicky.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.759
Look, our relationship
is on the rocks.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.494
I can't do this without you.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.430
I just can't clean up
grown man poop anymore.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.766
- I ate all Gladys' cigarettes.
- Gladys!

06:38.799 --> 06:40.434
(Cat)
Come back.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.436
You can't leave me here.
He's dying.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.004
I'm gonna go to
doggy heaven!

06:44.037 --> 06:45.806
- You're dying, girl.
- What?

06:45.839 --> 06:49.109
I'll tell you something my uncle
used to say to me in Sweden.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.446
Figure out your life.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.548
Figure out your life?

06:54.582 --> 06:56.884
Huh, so cryptic.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.653
- I'm pooping again.
- Clip it off!

06:59.687 --> 07:04.157
* You came without warning
and you took me away *

07:04.191 --> 07:05.793
* I can't help..

07:05.826 --> 07:08.562
There you are, Boo-boo.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.031
- I cured cancer, you dick!
- What?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.601
I see the big C-U-F-N-D!

07:13.634 --> 07:15.569
Glenn, I know that you know

07:15.603 --> 07:19.239
that cancer is an amalgam of-of
complicated unique conditions.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.775
It's almost impossible
to find one cure.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.911
Oh yeah?
Check it out, honkey!

07:23.944 --> 07:26.113
Boom!
Ha-ha-ha!

07:27.781 --> 07:29.817
- Dick!
- H-h-how?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.184
Butterfly goop, okay.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.653
Let's start killing
some butterflies--

07:32.686 --> 07:33.987
No, no, no!

07:34.021 --> 07:36.790
I would gladly sacrifice all
my beautiful friends

07:36.824 --> 07:38.926
if it cured
one case of cancer.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.862
But don't you think,
we should run tests first?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.531
Yeah, you might be right.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.066
Is it the bile? The blood?
The mucus? The semen?

07:46.099 --> 07:48.736
Who we gonna get to jack off
these butterflies?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.170
I'd do that.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.506
Well, I-I-I,
if no one else was available.

07:52.540 --> 07:56.076
I would clearly volunteer.
I would, I would..

07:56.109 --> 07:58.879
Why don't we just run
some tests?

07:58.912 --> 08:01.782
And if you actually
did this, Glenn

08:01.815 --> 08:04.618
you'd have done more than just
solve the financial problem

08:04.652 --> 08:06.286
of this hospital.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.022
[instrumental music]

08:09.056 --> 08:11.124
(male narrator)
Next on Blake Downs M.D.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.226
America loses a dear friend.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.228
My private practice
went out of business.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.297
'But it's okay.'

08:17.330 --> 08:20.300
It's okay. I'm sure children's
hospital will take me back.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.903
In a dramatic final episode.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.238
[wailing]

08:25.272 --> 08:28.008
I just wanted it to be quiet!

08:28.041 --> 08:30.878
He's doing Hawkeye's monologue
from the M.A.S.H finale.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.780
It was a baby!

08:33.813 --> 08:36.717
She smothered her own baby!

08:36.750 --> 08:40.587
(narrator)
Coming up tonight,
after Children's Hospital.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.756
(female on speaker)
'Dr. Jules Stancil,
please report..'

08:42.789 --> 08:47.160
Well, crap! Ugh! Baby's living
on the big side.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.297
But other than that, I'd say
that everything looks great.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.232
Really great.
Can I tell you

08:52.265 --> 08:54.301
it's so nice
to see your vagina again.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.069
Thanks for seeing me.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.305
You know, I can't see my
normal O-B-G-Y-N anymore.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.874
Why? The guy doesn't like
looking at engorged vaginas?

09:00.908 --> 09:03.877
- Sounds like a jerk!
- I can't keep this baby.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.946
I'm not even in love
with Nicky anymore.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.881
I'm so afraid
of my future.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.850
[laughing]

09:09.883 --> 09:11.652
What are you
laughing at?

09:11.685 --> 09:14.321
I was remembering how your
vagina used to look before.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.790
- Owen!
- It's like a open faced Reuben.

09:16.824 --> 09:20.260
I can't keep this baby.
Can you help me?

09:20.293 --> 09:23.296
Cat, listen to me.
You're full term now.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.933
'The risk to your life,
not to mention the baby's'

09:25.966 --> 09:28.769
are just too great
to consider termination.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.138
You're an old friend.
So, I'll think about it.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.006
- Oh, God, thank you!
- Yeah.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.207
- Wow!
- Hey!

09:34.241 --> 09:36.143
Had to get a quick pic.
Gosh!

09:36.176 --> 09:39.647
It's like the mouth of a fish,
if you yanked the hook out.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.815
- Really weird.
- Hey, Ow.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.351
Why's there an O-B-G-Y-N clinic
in the Children's hospital?

09:44.384 --> 09:48.889
Babies are having babies
nowadays. Read the papers.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.791
[melancholic music]

09:50.824 --> 09:54.394
July, 11th.
3:00 AM.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.798
I've extracted blood, bile,
tears, breast milk and mucus

09:57.831 --> 09:59.266
from the insect.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.968
And nothing.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.271
13 hours and I've only
learnt one thing.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.340
You can't jack off
a dead butterfly.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.843
[music continues]

10:09.877 --> 10:12.312
Ah! I need coffee.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.050
[dramatic music]

10:28.929 --> 10:31.198
[dramatic music]

10:35.402 --> 10:38.338
[music continues]

10:52.485 --> 10:55.122
My body's more broker than the
American Health Care system.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.426
[music continues]

10:59.459 --> 11:01.762
(female #2)
'Doctor, doctor,
give me the news.'

11:01.795 --> 11:04.798
'I've got
a bad case...of meningitis.'
