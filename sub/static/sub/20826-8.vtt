Sorry. I'm just excited to see Sue.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.439

00:25.442 --> 00:26.485
What's your problem?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.570
Did you strain your trunk

I sweated on the cushions,
so I flipped them over.

There was a food stain on the other
side, so I flipped them back,

01:01.952 --> 01:04.037

09:58.056 --> 10:01.684
Then go play with that metal
mouth girl with the big head.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.603
His name is Phillip, and he's a boy.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.523
But I'm not friends with him anymore.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.941
[squirrels chittering]

10:08.024 --> 10:11.361
Uh-oh. This show just got interesting.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.072
[Kenny] That's how Mama
bought our Christmas tree.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.282
Well, well, well...

10:16.366 --> 10:19.536
- Holy shit!
- That monster boy's back!

10:19.619 --> 10:20.745
Run!

10:20.829 --> 10:22.664
Y'all can finish at our house!

10:23.498 --> 10:25.792
Bill Murphy.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.710
I've been looking for you.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.212
Uh, hey, Jimmy.

10:29.838 --> 10:34.884
You look nice. Did you just...
come from a parade or something?

10:34.968 --> 10:39.347
Somebody pinned a hockey stick
on me that I didn't steal.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.598
Really?

10:40.682 --> 10:42.767
My dad sent me to military school,

10:42.851 --> 10:44.686
where they taught me
honor and discipline

10:44.769 --> 10:46.896
by repeatedly beating
the shit out of me.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.565
I was released last night

10:48.648 --> 10:51.609
after demonstrating
sustained excellence.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.528
And my dad's check bounced.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.446
Glad to see you're doing well.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.824
Uh, I think I hear my mom calling me.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.076
You're not going anywhere.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.536
[grunts]

11:01.619 --> 11:05.039
You and me have unfinished business.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.083
Hold these.

11:10.420 --> 11:15.300
"Bill Murphy, I humbly apologize for
calling you the following names,

11:15.383 --> 11:17.176
in alphabetical order:

11:17.260 --> 11:21.014
ass butt, ass dick, ass eater..."

11:21.097 --> 11:22.515
[laughs]

11:22.599 --> 11:24.350
Not funny, private!

11:24.434 --> 11:26.853
[grunting]

11:26.936 --> 11:29.898
"Ass fuck, ass gasser..."

11:32.025 --> 11:34.360
This is where you guys will
be rocking out tomorrow.

11:34.444 --> 11:38.489
I had to get rid of the shark tank, but
it was worth it. I'll tell you what.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.325
Kevin, check it out!

11:40.408 --> 11:42.410
[laughing]

11:43.536 --> 11:44.996
You got to try this, Murph.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.249
Yeah, no. I don't feel like it.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.501
Don't be such a twat-rocket.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.545
This party's gonna kick serious ass,

11:53.129 --> 11:56.174
and we will be discovered
for the geniuses we are!

11:56.257 --> 11:59.219
- I guess you're right.
- Of course they're right!

11:59.302 --> 12:01.554
I like your bong half-full
attitude, fellas.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.223
Go ahead, look around the house.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.351
Just be careful if you
go in the bathroom.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.645
There's a hammerhead in the tub.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.563
Oh, man.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.193
- Oh, man!
- Take a picture, it'll last longer.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.945
- Can I?
- No!

12:17.028 --> 12:20.156
And take your hand out of your pocket.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.408
Vic, who are those little...

12:23.910 --> 12:27.413
- Oh, shit!
- I knew you'd be happy!

12:27.497 --> 12:30.249
Kevin and his band are gonna play
a few songs for us tomorrow.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.668
Great.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.505
I'm so excited. Yeah. I have to leave.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.092
- Hey, wow, what got into her?
- How should I know?

12:39.175 --> 12:41.719
Geminis, right? She'll be
in a good mood tomorrow

12:41.803 --> 12:44.555
because this party's
gonna be shit on ice.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.391
That's a good thing.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.435
All my music friends are gonna love you.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.523
This is your first baby
step to superstardom.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.775
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

12:55.858 --> 13:00.446
Because when you take that stage,
they will look into your soul

13:00.530 --> 13:01.823
and they'll see what I see.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.784
You're pure, man. You're honest.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.869
Not one ounce of bullshit.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.790
So, bring out the light tomorrow, Kev.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.459
Show them the truth of rock and roll.

13:14.294 --> 13:18.715
That's what all the great ones do, and
you've got that greatness in you.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.633
I love you, buddy.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.888
Oh, I need to kill myself.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.348
[Goomer] Don't do it, Kevin.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.185
There's so much to live for.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.898
[Sue] Okay, we got to hurry.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.359
After I drop you off, I'm gonna
meet your father for lunch.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.987
Oh, you're going to talk
about "the big fight"?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.697
Oh, so you heard that?

13:42.780 --> 13:46.159
Yes. I heard you say it
on the phone just now,

13:46.242 --> 13:47.785
and I heard it this morning...

13:47.869 --> 13:50.663
and in my classroom, in
the meeting about me.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.624
I'm sorry, honey, but don't worry.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.378
Arguing between mommies and
daddies sometimes gets loud,

13:57.462 --> 13:58.588
the police show up,

13:58.671 --> 14:01.090
but that doesn't mean we
don't love each other.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.468
- Does that make you feel better?
- Yeah.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.596
Plus, Daddy told me we're too poor
for you guys to get divorced.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.598
Does that make you feel better?

14:09.432 --> 14:12.685
Uh...

14:12.769 --> 14:13.770
Look at that, we're here!

14:15.521 --> 14:16.521
[Maureen] Ow!

14:17.356 --> 14:20.610
[Pogo] How about we drop
Scoop deep in the jungle,

14:20.693 --> 14:23.613
give him a fair, five-second head start,

14:23.696 --> 14:25.531
and then hunt him down?

14:25.615 --> 14:27.825
That is the dumbest
thing I've ever heard!

14:27.909 --> 14:30.536
No, it's good! It's like
<i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>

14:30.620 --> 14:34.415
You dummy. The most dangerous game
was ancient Aztec basketball.

14:34.499 --> 14:38.169
That's right. The losers got
their hearts ripped out!

14:38.252 --> 14:41.923
Guys, what the fuck are we
talking about? Focus on Scoop!

14:42.507 --> 14:45.301
I don't just have my job riding
on this, it's my marriage.

14:45.385 --> 14:49.305
Sue is this close to sending me on
a one-way trip to living at the Y.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.141
That's it! A one-way trip!

14:52.225 --> 14:53.810
That's how to get rid of Scoop!

14:53.893 --> 14:56.604
We put Scoop on a plane
to the middle of nowhere.

14:56.687 --> 15:00.233
Yeah. We'll do it on a busy day when
there's a lot of luggage moving.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.818
Without Scoop there,

15:01.901 --> 15:05.071
Dunbarton will turn the
department over to any dumb fuck.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.658
And that dumb fuck's
name is Frank Murphy.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.244
I think this plan's taking shape!
We're getting somewhere!

15:11.327 --> 15:14.455
Gentlemen, this calls for a celebration.

15:14.539 --> 15:19.252
Who wants to get erect watching
robot bears do stuff to each other?

15:19.335 --> 15:20.461
[together] Nobody.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.505
Speak for yourself!

15:23.464 --> 15:27.427
[Jimmy] "Zebra breath,
zit fart, zit tumor."

15:28.010 --> 15:29.220
End of list.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.180
Okay, well, I better...

15:31.264 --> 15:34.767
Now for the things I said
I would do to your mom.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.394
"Shit on her feet,

15:36.477 --> 15:37.728
shit on her corpse..."

15:37.812 --> 15:40.523
Jimmy, really, it's enough!
I forgive you!

15:40.606 --> 15:43.943
Okay, I have other people
on my list to get to anyway

15:44.026 --> 15:46.028
before my dad picks me up.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.616
[Bill] "Old sad Hitler guy?"

15:50.700 --> 15:52.869
You mean Mr. Holtenwasser?

15:52.952 --> 15:55.538
I must apologize for
blowing up his mailbox.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.498
You don't want to talk
to that crazy old man.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.917
All he does is tell made-up
stories about the war

16:00.001 --> 16:01.461
and what kids who live
on his street say.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.712
I have no choice.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.964
Jimmy, no, don't go!

16:05.047 --> 16:08.176
My honor code compels me, ball gargler!

16:08.843 --> 16:09.677
[grunts]

16:09.760 --> 16:11.971
Sorry I called you "ball gargler."

16:12.805 --> 16:14.307
Left. Left.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.683
Left, left, left.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.977
Shit! I'm dead! [sobs]

16:27.111 --> 16:29.614
- Hey, good looking!
- You came on time.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.408
Of course I did. When have
I ever disappointed you?

16:32.492 --> 16:36.329
Well, actually that's what I was
hoping we could talk about today.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.415
- Now, I made a list of things...
- You don't need that now!

16:39.499 --> 16:41.167
- It's all fixed, honey!
- It's what?

16:41.250 --> 16:44.378
I met Pogo and the guys at
the robot bear sex pizzeria.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.088
They're gonna help me
get my old job back!

16:46.172 --> 16:47.507
Our problems are over!

16:47.590 --> 16:50.384
But I thought we came to
talk about our marriage.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.845
I am talking. You're just not listening.

16:52.929 --> 16:56.182
Once I get back to Mohican, I won't
have to work at night anymore.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.060
Things will be like they used
to be and we'll be happy again!

16:59.143 --> 17:00.353
I wasn't too happy then.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.771
You were ecstatic!

17:01.854 --> 17:04.022
Agh! Why did I even come here?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.317
I moved my whole day around for you!

17:06.400 --> 17:09.694
I could've been with Vivian and
Henrietta testing the Salad Tosser.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.113
Once I get my job back,

17:11.196 --> 17:13.406
you don't have to worry about
that goddamn thing anymore!

17:13.491 --> 17:15.034
It's not a "goddamn thing!"

17:15.785 --> 17:18.746
It's my chance to do
something with my life.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.332
And you were supposed to
be there for support.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.834
- Frank, you promised me.
- When?

17:23.917 --> 17:25.461
In 1958!

17:25.545 --> 17:28.548
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax. Relax.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.884
Tell you what. I'm gonna
go out and have a smoke.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.388
You take a few minutes to calm down
and then we can talk like adults.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.063
[door closes]

17:44.146 --> 17:45.273
Can I get the check?

17:46.899 --> 17:49.819
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!

17:52.572 --> 17:53.573
[dog barks]

17:56.033 --> 17:58.452
The old me would've
got upset about that.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.668
Well, hello there, young Bill.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.671
Mr. Holtenwasser, Jimmy's
gonna be here any second.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.089
Please don't tell him I'm the one

18:10.172 --> 18:12.091
that got him sent away
to military school.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.553
Oh, I had forgotten all about that.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.388
Tell me again what happened.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.681
It's not important.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.267
The past is always important.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.853
For instance, in 1922,

18:23.936 --> 18:29.483
my father hired a young veteran of
the great war to paint our house.

18:29.567 --> 18:33.404
He forgot to pay him on time and
the young man was so angry...

18:33.487 --> 18:34.739
Oh, shit!

18:34.822 --> 18:35.906
[panting]

18:35.990 --> 18:38.784
I'll finish the story some other time.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.996
It has a twist you won't see coming!

18:42.079 --> 18:44.624
[Jimmy] "Pumpkin pussy, pussy pussy."

18:44.707 --> 18:47.168
Oh, it feels good to get
this off my chest, sir.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.046
I too have a secret buried in my bosom.

18:50.129 --> 18:54.383
Then you must unburden yourself.
It's the only way to achieve honor.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.386
Bill and I stole that hockey stick

18:57.470 --> 18:59.889
and we're the reason you
went to military school.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.602
You're right. That felt so good...

19:04.685 --> 19:07.563
- I had to write a list because of you!
- My spleen!

19:07.647 --> 19:09.357
Why did you tell him, Phillip?

19:09.940 --> 19:12.526
I misread the situation!

19:12.610 --> 19:15.988
You ass tit! I'll kill you
for what they did to me!

19:16.739 --> 19:18.282
You're next, Murphy!

19:18.366 --> 19:21.661
Jimmy James Fitzsimmons,
get in this fucking car!

19:21.744 --> 19:23.788
Yeah, you've seen the light!

19:23.871 --> 19:25.831
Beating up little fat girls!

19:25.915 --> 19:27.917
I ought to kick your ass!

19:28.000 --> 19:29.335
I'm a boy!

19:29.418 --> 19:31.045
I'm coming for you, Murphy!

19:31.128 --> 19:34.048
I will shit on your mother's feet!

19:38.886 --> 19:41.681
God damn him. Why do I even try?

19:42.431 --> 19:43.265
What's that?

19:43.349 --> 19:46.060
Oh, it's just a little thing I invented.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.689
- It spin-dries lettuce.
- Really? That's a great idea.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.316
I know! It is!

19:52.900 --> 19:53.900
All right, Sue.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.696
I'll give you a few minutes to
think about what you've done,

19:56.779 --> 19:58.447
and then you can apologize first.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.453
Co-pilot?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.624
- Are you sure?
- The doctor was.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.501
I'm due in July.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.337
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.381
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.633
We're gonna be okay, Sue.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.719
I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.930
Holy shit, I'm not going anywhere.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.975
- There goes flight school.
- Goodbye college for me.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.186
Oh, hold on.

20:29.812 --> 20:33.065
This doesn't have to be the end.
It's just a little delay.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.151
It's a baby. How much
work could that be?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.902
- We can do this.
- Sure we can.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.281
You raise the baby, and I'll get
a job to get us through this.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.283
I'm sure I could go
full-time at Mohican.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.826
They love me there.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.953
I'll ask Bob Pogo to put
in a good word for me

20:46.036 --> 20:48.247
when he gets back from the
Ballroom Dancing Championships.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.167
But you had your heart
set on becoming a pilot.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.251
And I will.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.088
Once the kid's in school, we
can pick up where we left off.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.339
I'll fly planes.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.925
And I'll finish college
and have my career.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.344
Yeah, and whatever it is you want to do,

21:02.428 --> 21:04.263
I'll support you all the way.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.265
I'll be your co-pilot.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.393
- Deal?
- Deal.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.272
- I love you, honey.
- I love you.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.527
Aw, Christ.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.200
What the fuck?

21:25.868 --> 21:29.455
Round and round it goes and the
water never gets on your clothes.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.708
And voilà... dry lettuce every time.

21:34.335 --> 21:37.213
I don't see technology getting
any better than this!

21:37.296 --> 21:39.089
[man] I could watch this all day!

21:39.173 --> 21:41.258
- Dry more lettuce!
- If you insist!

21:41.801 --> 21:42.927
With the Salad Tosser,

21:43.010 --> 21:46.722
you can always have dry lettuce when
you need it at the turn of a crank.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.807
[woman] Ooh.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.475
Sue, I'm ready to listen now.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.951
Just a second. Smoke another cigarette.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.228
Do you have any questions?

21:52.311 --> 21:56.398
It works on iceberg lettuce,
sure, but what about romaine?

21:56.482 --> 21:58.651
There's not a leafy green you can name

21:58.734 --> 22:00.402
that can't be dried by this little baby.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.488
Look at this silky-smooth
cranking motion.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.240
Sue, I'm ready to talk
about our marriage.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.741
You had your chance!

22:05.825 --> 22:07.243
I'm busy.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.999
Wow. I'll just...

22:15.251 --> 22:16.293
I'll see you at home.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.128
[woman] Spin it again, sister!

22:18.212 --> 22:22.842
Because it's plastic, the Salad
Tosser will last forever.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.928
It never rusts, never wears...

22:26.845 --> 22:28.514
and it'll never let you down.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.933
[cheering and applause]

22:38.023 --> 22:39.023
Sue, I...

22:42.987 --> 22:44.738
[sighs]

22:49.702 --> 22:51.787
- Sue.
- What?

22:55.666 --> 22:57.167
[sighs]

23:00.004 --> 23:02.548
Now, you and Bill behave for
Kevin while we're gone.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.301
[Maureen] Bill won't be a problem.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.761
He hasn't come out of
his room all afternoon.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.306
[screams]

23:10.389 --> 23:12.016
Bye-bye, sweetie.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.852
- We'll be fine.
- That's what you said this morning.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.187
We're just gonna have some
Mom and Dad talking time.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.480
It'll be fun.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.442
Hello, you two.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.652
Ready to pray away the hurt?

23:23.736 --> 23:24.987
Oh, Jesus.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.615
That's the spirit! Hop in!

23:27.698 --> 23:29.783
- Oh, hello, Murphys!
- Hey, guys.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.410
[both] Fuck me.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.662
Kevin, we're going to Lake Communion,

23:33.746 --> 23:35.289
but we'll be back tomorrow night.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.249
The phone number's on the fridge.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.168
Kevin, are you listening to me?

23:39.251 --> 23:40.336
Yeah, I'm listening!

23:40.419 --> 23:42.129
God! Get off my case!

23:42.212 --> 23:45.132
Oh, you're lucky a priest
is taking me to the woods.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.183
- Where are they going?
- Oh, we're gonna die.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.894
This is the express train.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.730
Next stop, Understandingville!

24:00.356 --> 24:02.941
<i>- ♪ If you're working on your marriage ♪</i>
- Oh, Jesus.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.777

24:19.041 --> 24:22.962
[Father Pat] Oh, Francis. There
are 12, one for each apostle!

24:23.045 --> 24:24.505
[Frank] Oh, shit.
