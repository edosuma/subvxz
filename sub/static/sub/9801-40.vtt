It's game night.

01:10.960 --> 01:11.660
-Trivia!

01:11.660 --> 01:12.900
Let's play trivia.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.350
I dominate trivia.

01:14.350 --> 01:15.050
-Oh!

01:15.050 --> 01:16.420
Can we play Simon
Says this week?

01:16.420 --> 01:17.120
-Yes.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.600

delightful amusements.

OK.

Oh, Private!

Private, where are you?

01:59.230 --> 02:01.240
I don't have the bomb.

-Oh dear.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.810
-Hot potato?

02:22.810 --> 02:26.200
Is that what you maniacs call
destroying someone's home?

02:26.200 --> 02:29.100
-No, but in certain
parts of Mongolia,

02:29.100 --> 02:33.600
destroying someone's
yurt is called Tepid Yam.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.370
-I wanted to play trivia.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.780
-Leonard, it was
a freak accident.

02:37.780 --> 02:40.220
The odds of your
habitat incurring damage

02:40.220 --> 02:43.460

they again, Kowalski?

02:43.460 --> 02:44.160
-One in three.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.170
-Right.

02:45.170 --> 02:48.400
I think we can all agree
that was a risk worth taking.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.810
-Leave me alone.

02:49.810 --> 02:52.610
-I'm sure the zoo will have
this hole patched up in no time.

02:52.610 --> 02:54.290
You'll see.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.130
-Hm.

02:55.130 --> 02:56.520
Damage is structural.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.960
I must knock down whole
habitat, start fresh.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.660
Big job.

03:00.660 --> 03:01.820
-Nuts.

03:01.820 --> 03:04.640
I'll have to move the koala
somewhere in the meantime.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.630
Maybe he'd get along
with the kangaroo.

03:06.630 --> 03:09.020
I mean, they're
both from Austria.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.390
-You mean Australia, da?

03:11.390 --> 03:13.150
-There's a difference?

03:13.150 --> 03:14.540
-Leonard and Joey together?

03:14.540 --> 03:15.540
-Ay, ay, ay.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.730
-I calculate the odds
of Leonard surviving

03:17.730 --> 03:20.600
that scenario at 100%.

-Really?

03:21.530 --> 03:22.390
-No, wait.

03:22.390 --> 03:24.420
I was holding it upside down.

03:24.420 --> 03:28.210
That's 0% with an
exclamation point.

03:28.210 --> 03:30.770
-Somehow I feel this
is partially our fault.

03:30.770 --> 03:32.650
-It's entirely our fault.

03:32.650 --> 03:35.580
-Let's not point fingers
we don't have, Private.

03:35.580 --> 03:38.480
Anywho, we'd better smooth this
over with the hoppy marsupial.

-Joey don't like visitors.

03:59.250 --> 04:03.980
-Um, then I don't imagine
you'd fancy a roommate.

04:03.980 --> 04:04.710
-A roommate?

04:08.140 --> 04:09.860
Yeah, that might be a fair go.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.620
-Is that a yes?

04:11.620 --> 04:12.320
-Sure.

only roo in the zoo.

-Shela?

04:19.010 --> 04:21.260
Yeah, you know, girl.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.650
Joey's got a hungry heart,
just like everyone else.

04:23.650 --> 04:26.070
-Um, well, it's
not quite a shela.

04:29.490 --> 04:30.190
-Hurry, hurry.

I do not want to miss a moment
of the melee in midtown,

the big to do in the zoo.

trying to pull?

04:48.740 --> 04:49.580

04:49.580 --> 04:51.960
That's not even a kangaroo.

-Leonard is a koala.

-I don't care what he is.

He's not staying here.

Now get out before
I throw you out.

Blimey, I think
this bloke's kicked.

05:02.140 --> 05:03.200
-No, he's not.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.580
He's nocturnal.

05:06.580 --> 05:07.800
He sleeps all day.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.190
-Therefore, with your
divergent sleeping schedules,

your interaction will be
kept at an absolute minimum.

05:12.870 --> 05:13.570

05:13.570 --> 05:15.890
You'll hardly even
know he's here.

05:15.890 --> 05:19.330
Heck, you could even use him
as a footstool if you want.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.710
-Well, maybe this
will work after all.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.200
-Fantastic.

20:10.380 --> 20:14.010
Ringtail, I'll need
your, um, acting skills.

20:17.230 --> 20:17.940
-Oh.

20:17.940 --> 20:19.030
Um, 'scuse me.

20:19.030 --> 20:21.260
As a licenced professor
of, um, doctorology,

20:21.260 --> 20:25.250
I could not help to notice
you've got something, um-- no,

20:25.250 --> 20:27.100
not there.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.480
A bit closer.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.360
Almost.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.260
Oh.

20:32.260 --> 20:33.770
There it is, in your face.

20:38.490 --> 20:40.130
-Hurry, Kowalski.

20:40.130 --> 20:42.840
-I'm trying.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.300
Why did I choose magnesium?

20:44.300 --> 20:48.450
-There's no telling what
they're doing to poor--

20:48.450 --> 20:50.350
-Hooray for invasion!

20:50.350 --> 20:51.290
-Awesome!

20:51.290 --> 20:53.400
Give the order, great one.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.100
-OK.

20:54.100 --> 20:54.930
Start!

20:54.930 --> 20:55.950
-Stop!

20:55.950 --> 20:58.260
-Behold the one
thing powerful enough

20:58.260 --> 21:02.630
to snap you out of this
rat trap, the feet.

21:02.630 --> 21:05.260
-Yoo hoo.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.570
-Rats don't like feet.

21:06.570 --> 21:07.840
-Well, that was all I had.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.110
-Go for it, great one.

21:09.110 --> 21:11.570
Show 'em your awesome
invasion plan.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.060
-Surround the animals!

21:20.040 --> 21:26.270
-And now, unleash the
kisses and huggies!

21:26.270 --> 21:28.920
-Yeah, the kiss-- what?

21:28.920 --> 21:30.240
-Never question the great one.

21:35.450 --> 21:36.660
-Do you mind, buddy boy?

21:40.440 --> 21:44.340
-You let Mort make
the invasion plan?

21:44.340 --> 21:47.730
-Well, yeah, but this
is just part one.

21:47.730 --> 21:48.430
-No.

21:48.430 --> 21:49.860
This is the everything.

21:49.860 --> 21:52.870
-But you're the great one.

21:52.870 --> 21:56.110
You're supposed to lead us to
toasty houses and fresh food.

21:56.110 --> 21:56.810
-Oh.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.240
Food!

21:58.240 --> 22:00.880
Well, I always keep
some strawberry jelly

22:00.880 --> 22:02.930
on my tail for snacking.

22:02.930 --> 22:03.760
See?

22:03.760 --> 22:05.430
Oh, it's good.

22:05.430 --> 22:07.380
Mm.

22:07.380 --> 22:10.090
-I knew we should have
stuck with punching stuff.

22:14.580 --> 22:15.280
-Bye bye.

22:22.060 --> 22:22.760
-See?

22:22.760 --> 22:23.460
-Careful.

22:23.460 --> 22:26.280
Mort's brain has been
completely destabilised.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.870
It could take
months, even years,

22:27.870 --> 22:29.800
to bring him back
from his rat state.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.250
-Am I all done
being the rat now?

22:32.250 --> 22:32.950
-Or fast.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.580
It could be fast.

22:34.580 --> 22:38.980
-Sad Eyes was the most amazing
undercover work I've ever seen.

22:38.980 --> 22:39.690
-Yeah.

22:39.690 --> 22:42.000
I still got, like, 10
characters on you, though.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.950
I'm just saying.

22:43.950 --> 22:46.140
-Well done, tiny soldier.

22:46.140 --> 22:49.690
Consider yourself
an honorary penguin.

22:49.690 --> 22:50.580
-Be the penguin.

22:53.420 --> 22:54.460
-Hey.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.910
-You didn't see anything.
