09:01.380 --> 09:03.880
-Mistress Monk!
-And now,

09:03.880 --> 09:05.960
my superfan is
gonna show you

09:05.960 --> 09:07.960
how to escape
a hammerlock.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.040
Escape a what?

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
Follow my lead, kid.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.330
[Businessman grunts]

09:14.330 --> 09:15.710
[crowd exclaiming]

09:15.710 --> 09:19.460
Harley! Harley!
Harley!

09:19.460 --> 09:21.830
[all chanting]
Harley! Harley!

09:21.830 --> 09:25.040
Harley! Harley! Harley!

09:25.040 --> 09:26.290
[Harley] Not only
did I have a good time,

09:26.290 --> 09:27.540
but I turned Aidan

09:27.540 --> 09:28.880
from an enemy
into a friend.

09:28.880 --> 09:29.880
Sounds like you turned him

09:29.880 --> 09:32.540
into more than a friend.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.670
Do you think I should
use the purple side?

09:34.670 --> 09:35.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can't just drop

09:35.960 --> 09:37.920
a bomb like that
and then ask me
about purple.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.040
Well, I'm just saying.
It sounds like Aidan

09:40.040 --> 09:42.000
did a lot of stuff
to help you have fun.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.120
He talked you into
tackling a bop bag.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.920
That was more
for him than me.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.000
He got an entire crowd
to chant your name.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.920
They were this close to
doing that on their own.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.250
And every time you said
the name "Aidan"

09:52.250 --> 09:54.120
during your story,
you smiled.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.880
Please. I didn't smile
when I said "Aidan."

09:56.880 --> 09:58.000
Did it again.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.880
Face it, you like him.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.580
Okay, you're crazy.

10:06.580 --> 10:09.080
And your sign says,
"Good Morning Bontos."

10:09.080 --> 10:11.080
Not "Boston."

10:11.080 --> 10:12.670
[sighs]

10:12.670 --> 10:15.120
Well, my sign making
may not be great,

10:15.120 --> 10:17.120
but my instincts are.
You like Aidan.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.540
He was the most appealing guy

10:19.540 --> 10:20.880
at a wrestling convention.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.420
That's a very low bar.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.920
We're just friends.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.040
I don't like Aidan.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.960
[chuckles]
You just smiled again.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.460
That's just how I look.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.120
I have resting smile face.

10:32.210 --> 10:33.830
Aidan said The Businessman

10:33.830 --> 10:35.420
is staying in a hotel
in Marshport!

10:35.420 --> 10:36.960
We're gonna
stake it out tomorrow

10:36.960 --> 10:40.080
to see if he'll put us
in our own hammerlock.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.960
-I'm in!
-Yes! Come on.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.290
Mm, nothing strange there.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.920
Just Harley jumping
at the chance

10:46.920 --> 10:47.960
to ambush a guy in tights

10:47.960 --> 10:49.500
with her little brothers
and a neighbor.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.290
Oh, yeah,
you're right, Georgie.

10:51.290 --> 10:53.040
'Cause every
classic love story

10:53.040 --> 10:55.330
starts with stalking
a pretend businessman.

10:55.330 --> 10:57.540
Not everyone's, just yours.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.460
[crowd cheering]

11:01.460 --> 11:02.620
Excuse me!

11:02.620 --> 11:04.120
[chuckles]
Pardon me.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.120
Sorry.
Oh! Nice shoes.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.040
[Suzy chuckles]
Yeah, we're still
not close enough.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.580
I think you're gonna have to
channel our inner Rachel.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.750
[sighs]
Out of my way!

11:13.750 --> 11:15.080
Don't mess with the dress!

11:15.080 --> 11:17.120
[Suzy]
High heel coming through!

11:17.120 --> 11:19.080
[grunts] Whoo!

11:19.080 --> 11:21.120
Wow, that came out
a bit too naturally.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.960
I'm gonna blame the dress.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.040
Look at us!
We're front row!

11:26.960 --> 11:28.420
I'll text this to Rachel
and tell her to tune in

11:28.420 --> 11:30.120
-to the livestream.
-Ooh, we did it!

11:30.120 --> 11:31.330
She's gonna freak.
[sighs]

11:31.330 --> 11:32.580
-[phone dings]
-Oh!

11:32.580 --> 11:33.960
Is she blown away?
What'd she say?

11:33.960 --> 11:36.620
We have the dresses
on backwards.

11:36.620 --> 11:39.120
We're about to debut
her creations backwards.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.710
Backwards? What?!

11:41.710 --> 11:43.380
We'll be right back
after this.

11:43.380 --> 11:44.920
-[crowd cheering]
-There's the camera.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.960
-Ooh!
-Run!

11:45.960 --> 11:47.920
[cheering]

11:51.210 --> 11:54.290
Oh, I see it now.

11:54.290 --> 11:55.540
Who would've thought?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.120
The zipper goes
in the front.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.960
Mm. I guess that's how
they do it in Paris.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.540
Yeah.

12:05.750 --> 12:08.000
I was surprised
you agreed to come.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.330
Well, I guess
you don't know me.

12:09.330 --> 12:11.040
Like Georgie
doesn't know me.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.500
Only I know me.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.670
Okay.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.080
Okay, so Georgie's theory
that I like Aidan,

12:19.080 --> 12:20.460
totally crazy!

12:20.460 --> 12:22.210
I mean, if I had
more evidence,

12:22.210 --> 12:23.170
I might consider it.

12:23.170 --> 12:24.920
But the right data

12:24.920 --> 12:25.920
just isn't there.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.080
And as a scientist,

12:27.080 --> 12:29.790
I'm all about the data.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.080
When do you think
The Businessman will show?

12:33.790 --> 12:35.250
Could be a while.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.830
He's always
getting stuck
in meetings.

12:36.830 --> 12:38.170
And doorways.

12:38.170 --> 12:44.210
[forced laughter]

12:44.210 --> 12:46.000
[Harley]
Why did I just laugh

12:46.000 --> 12:47.750
way too hard at that joke?

12:47.750 --> 12:51.210
[Harley blowing]

12:51.210 --> 12:53.500
Here, you can have this.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.120
I'm really not that cold.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.580
It's just sitting here.

12:56.580 --> 12:57.920
It'd be a waste
if someone
didn't use it.

12:59.420 --> 13:02.460
I could argue with you,
but I really don't want to.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.540
[lightly chuckles]

13:09.960 --> 13:11.670
[Harley] Why did I
just sniff his jacket?

13:13.670 --> 13:16.460
While we're waiting,
I got sour bears!

13:16.460 --> 13:18.210
-[Beast] Oh!
-Thanks, Aidster!

13:18.210 --> 13:19.460
What did you call me?

13:21.170 --> 13:22.880
She called you "Aidster."

13:22.880 --> 13:24.250
It's a nickname.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.290
I give everyone nicknames.

13:26.290 --> 13:29.040
Right, Beast-y-cakes?

13:32.250 --> 13:34.120
Uh-oh.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.290
Get out of my way!
Move, move!

13:36.290 --> 13:37.920
Ugh! Did no one hear me

13:37.920 --> 13:39.460
when I asked her
to save our spots?

13:39.460 --> 13:42.420
It's like dress emergency
means nothing to you people.

13:42.420 --> 13:43.830
[gasps]
There's the host again.

13:43.830 --> 13:45.420
Let's take a look at the crowd.

13:45.420 --> 13:47.330
There's a glittery sign.

13:47.330 --> 13:49.620
Oh! We have a
proposal here!

13:49.620 --> 13:52.250
[gasps]
Wait, seriously?

13:52.250 --> 13:54.080
[crowd cheering]

13:54.080 --> 13:56.750
It's a yes!

13:56.750 --> 13:58.460
That's all the time
we have today.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.620
Stay tuned for
Judge Larry's Chowder Court.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.540
[cheering continues]

14:03.540 --> 14:04.920
Ugh!

14:06.210 --> 14:07.580
Okay, so I laughed

14:07.580 --> 14:09.120
at Aidan's not-funny joke,

14:09.120 --> 14:10.710
I like the smell of his jacket,

14:10.710 --> 14:12.210
and I gave him a nickname.

14:12.210 --> 14:16.330
And I am very anti-nickname.

14:16.330 --> 14:18.330
The data's in.

14:18.330 --> 14:19.790
I like Aidster.

14:19.790 --> 14:21.000
Aidan.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.750
The Businessman!

14:28.750 --> 14:31.750
[Lewie and Beast shouting]

14:38.170 --> 14:40.040
Hey! Wait, wait! Guys!

14:40.040 --> 14:41.540
That's not The Businessman.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.210
That's a businessman.

14:43.210 --> 14:44.210
[Harley]
We're so sorry.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.330
They thought you were
a pro-wrestler.

14:46.330 --> 14:49.000
Which, honestly,
is a tribute

14:49.000 --> 14:49.960
to your workout routine.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.290
So, uh, good on you.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.750
[The Businessman]
Nice moves, men.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.040
Oh, we're huge fans.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.540
Think we could get
a company photo?

15:00.540 --> 15:01.920
Let's bring this meeting
to order.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.710
-[boys cheering]
-[Businessman chuckles]

15:04.710 --> 15:07.120
Hey, buddy, pull your
lady friend in tight.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.580
♪ Harley was wrong ♪

15:14.580 --> 15:16.210
♪ Georgie was right ♪

15:16.210 --> 15:17.460
♪ You like Aidan ♪

15:18.790 --> 15:20.210
[sighs] Sorry.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.080
I had a bad day,
and I really needed

15:22.080 --> 15:23.210
something to go my way.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.460
I'd be upset,
but your data

15:25.460 --> 15:26.830
supports the trash-talking.

15:26.830 --> 15:28.250
Oh, so what are you
gonna do now?

15:28.250 --> 15:30.540
Go to the mall?
Catch a movie?

15:30.540 --> 15:31.670
Oh, I'm shutting it down.

15:31.670 --> 15:34.830
Between school,
and inventing,

15:34.830 --> 15:37.000
the Slushy Shack,
and family stuff,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.210
I have no room
for a boy in my life.

15:39.210 --> 15:40.460
I don't think you can

15:40.460 --> 15:41.920
ignore your feelings
like that.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.380
Feelings that you proved
with science.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.580
Hey, science can prove
a lot of things.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.120
Doesn't mean
I have to do them.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.080
Science is not
the boss of me.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.710
It doesn't control
what I do.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.080
Hmm, what about gravity?

15:53.080 --> 15:54.750
You'd go flying
off the Earth.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.790
-Well, yeah, gravity.
-And oxygen?

15:56.790 --> 15:58.250
You like breathing,
don't you?

15:58.250 --> 16:00.880
I'm gonna go breathe
somewhere else.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.170
Hey, you finally
took our advice

16:16.170 --> 16:17.710
and invented
a shirt flinger.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.500
It's supposed to fold,
not fling.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.080
You know why this
still isn't working?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.420
Because I wasted so much time

16:23.420 --> 16:24.920
doing dumb wrestling stuff.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.670
Look, we appreciate
that you tried

16:27.670 --> 16:29.040
some of our
favorite things--

16:29.040 --> 16:31.120
getting put in
a hammerlock,

16:31.120 --> 16:32.460
hiding in bushes.

16:32.460 --> 16:35.500
So, we want to do
something that you like.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.830
Yep, we got four tickets
to the science museum.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.080
Us three plus Aidan.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.170
Let's keep the good times
rolling.

16:42.170 --> 16:44.620
Speaking of rolling,
should there happen to be

16:44.620 --> 16:46.380
a roller coaster
simulator there,

16:46.380 --> 16:48.330
that would be
a pleasant surprise.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.670
That wasn't at all a part
of this selfless gesture.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.460
Can't.

16:52.460 --> 16:55.120
Did you miss the
science museum part?

16:57.120 --> 16:58.670
Planetarium, Harley.

16:58.670 --> 17:00.710
Planetarium.

17:00.710 --> 17:02.380
I have work to do.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.250
Why would Harley say no
to the museum

17:10.250 --> 17:12.380
when she said yes
to the wrestling stuff?

17:12.380 --> 17:14.330
It doesn't make
any sense.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.960
I don't know what you two
are fighting about,

17:15.960 --> 17:17.330
but I'm in a dress,
so warn me

17:17.330 --> 17:19.040
before you start
throwing food.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.420
We're trying to figure out
what Beast did to Harley

17:21.420 --> 17:23.620
to make her not want to go to
the museum with Aidan and I.

17:23.620 --> 17:25.170
What Lewie did.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.120
But otherwise,
that's correct.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.420
For once it wasn't anything
either of you did.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.330
Harley said no
because Aidan was going.

17:33.170 --> 17:35.210
Well, she likes him,
but she doesn't want to.

17:35.210 --> 17:36.210
So she's avoiding him.

17:36.210 --> 17:38.000
She likes him,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.710
so she's staying
away from him.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.500
-That makes no sense!
-Hmm. I agree.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.620
It's very immature.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.290
Don't want any spill-sies.

17:47.710 --> 17:49.420
But we had a bunch
of other fun stuff

17:49.420 --> 17:51.500
planned for us all to do.

17:51.500 --> 17:55.330
And we can't do any of it
if she avoids him.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.250
It's not good to
live your life
avoiding things.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.330
You won't have any fun.

17:59.330 --> 18:00.750
And we don't avoid anything.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.380
Except high-fiving possums.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.080
Nothing they do deserves
a high-five.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.500
It's Rachel's birthday,

18:08.500 --> 18:10.170
and in France
it's already half over,

18:10.170 --> 18:12.080
-so this better work.
-Ugh, seriously.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.670
I've had my foot
stepped on 300 times

18:13.670 --> 18:14.790
in the past two days.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.040
That canasta club
from Tampa

18:16.040 --> 18:18.380
is very territorial.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.580
Oh, looks like they're
on a commercial break.

18:20.580 --> 18:22.540
See if you can get
Scott's attention.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.920
Hi, ladies.
Loving those dresses.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
Is there a story behind them?

18:27.920 --> 18:29.620
You bet there is, Scott.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.330
Great. Why don't you tell me
after our next segment?

18:32.330 --> 18:34.620
Oh! He said segment.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.460
I feel like we're
in Hollywood.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.080
Welcome back, Beantown.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.540
Coming up, Chef Marcus
is gonna fire up

18:40.540 --> 18:42.460
some tasty yogurt smoothies.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.960
But first, here to promote
his latest movie,

18:44.960 --> 18:47.460
Take This Job and Smash It,

18:47.460 --> 18:48.830
The Businessman!

18:48.830 --> 18:51.880
[crowd cheering]

18:51.880 --> 18:55.040
Get ready
for a hostile takeover!

18:55.040 --> 18:56.960
I understand
you're gonna show me

18:56.960 --> 18:58.420
how to escape
a hammerlock.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.830
Oh! Somebody get
my agent on the phone.

19:09.210 --> 19:10.500
[crowd screams]

19:10.500 --> 19:13.790
[crowd groaning]

19:13.790 --> 19:15.790
Wha-- No.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.460
Come on, Harley,
we need you
to fix the slide.

19:19.460 --> 19:20.750
Right now it's
more of a sit.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.420
I don't have time for this.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.500
You might as well
do it right now.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.500
Otherwise, we all
know it'll be:

19:28.500 --> 19:30.330
Do you have time now?
Do you have time now?
Do you have time now?

19:35.540 --> 19:37.500
What is this?

19:37.500 --> 19:39.830
Hey, the slide's
actually not broken.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.540
Well, clearly,
I'm in the way.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.710
So, enjoy the fresh
mud pies in the cooler.

19:49.170 --> 19:51.170
I was hoping you knew
what was going on.

19:51.170 --> 19:52.580
'Cause I made
the mistake of

19:52.580 --> 19:53.670
blindly following
them in here.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.420
You've got so much to learn.

20:04.830 --> 20:08.290
I guess someone wants us
to be alone together.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.080
Wasn't me.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.330
I don't wanna be
alone with you.

20:11.330 --> 20:12.750
Ever!

20:23.500 --> 20:25.500
-Oh, hmm.
-Hmm.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.830
What was that out there?!

20:28.830 --> 20:31.080
That's us
trying to help you.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.710
We know you like Aidan.

20:32.710 --> 20:34.750
-What?! No.
-Drop the act.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.710
Georgie told us
you like him.

20:36.710 --> 20:37.830
I can't believe it.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.830
Georgie is such a blabber face.

20:39.830 --> 20:42.580
I think that's
been established.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.750
[sighs]
If you like Aidan,

20:44.750 --> 20:46.620
why are you avoiding him?

20:46.620 --> 20:49.960
Two months ago I was
trying to destroy him

20:49.960 --> 20:52.500
with an army of children.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.750
Just never thought
that I--

20:53.750 --> 20:55.580
[clears throat]

20:55.580 --> 20:57.330
All right, Harley.

20:57.330 --> 20:58.750
Oh, boy, you're going
to give me one of your

20:58.750 --> 20:59.670
long speeches,
aren't you?

20:59.670 --> 21:01.920
I am.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.420
Harley, you can't let
being afraid stop you

21:04.420 --> 21:06.420
from doing the things you want.

21:08.210 --> 21:09.290
When me and Beast
were learning

21:09.290 --> 21:10.620
how to ride a bike,

21:10.620 --> 21:11.880
Dad used to run behind us

21:11.880 --> 21:13.460
because we were afraid.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.000
But one day he let go,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.580
and we were riding
on our own.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.830
Didn't you guys
crash the first time?

21:19.830 --> 21:22.330
Yeah, but that
was fun, too.

21:22.330 --> 21:23.750
Come on, you're
always the person

21:23.750 --> 21:25.830
who encourages people to
go for what they want.

21:25.830 --> 21:28.170
You got Rachel
to go to college,

21:28.170 --> 21:30.670
Georgie to dance,
Ethan to finish a movie.

21:30.670 --> 21:33.540
It's time for you to
take your own advice.

21:35.710 --> 21:38.210
Now.
My speech is done.

21:38.210 --> 21:40.210
[chuckles]

21:43.170 --> 21:45.920
Good news-- I got the show
to pay for our dry-cleaning.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
I told them if they didn't,
I'd see them

21:47.920 --> 21:49.920
in Judge Larry's Chowder Court.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.620
You're not going to
believe this,

21:51.620 --> 21:53.750
but the clip of us
getting smoothied on live TV

21:53.750 --> 21:55.830
already has
two hundred thousand views.

21:55.830 --> 21:57.920
Oh, no! When Rachel
hears about this

21:57.920 --> 21:59.330
she's gonna flip out.

21:59.330 --> 22:00.580
Rachel's the one
who posted it.

22:00.580 --> 22:04.500
[crowd exclaiming]

22:04.500 --> 22:06.790
She tagged it! [gasps]

22:06.790 --> 22:08.080
Thanks to our humiliation,

22:08.080 --> 22:10.210
her designs are getting
a ton of exposure.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.250
[chuckles]
And she just texted

22:12.250 --> 22:14.670
saying we could wear
her next two dresses
on TV, too.

22:14.670 --> 22:16.080
Ugh! Tell her to make 'em

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
in Daphne and Harley sizes.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.830
-Hmm. For real.
-[crowd exclaiming]

22:19.830 --> 22:21.420
-[chuckles]
-I know.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.670
It's great.

22:22.670 --> 22:23.880
Hey!

22:26.830 --> 22:29.670
I just wanna say
I had nothing to do

22:29.670 --> 22:31.670
with whatever that is
my brothers set up.

22:34.830 --> 22:37.500
But it's just
sitting there.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.500
It'd be a waste if
someone didn't use it.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.250
[chuckles] Uh,
I could argue with you,

22:44.250 --> 22:46.420
but I really don't want to.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.790
The racecar lights
were a nice touch.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.960
But, uh, I'd lay off
the mud pies if I were you.

23:13.250 --> 23:16.420
So, when do we ask them
to go paintballing?

23:16.420 --> 23:17.750
Let them enjoy this.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.960
Tomorrow we'll hit them up
about paintball.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.330
Then we'll hit them
with paintballs.
