[medical equipment beeping]

00:07.067 --> 00:09.833
Hi, Granny.

00:09.933 --> 00:12.133
How's the acting?

00:12.233 --> 00:13.500
Oh, that's not me.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.767
That's Bunny.

00:15.867 --> 00:18.200
Do I hear my name?

00:18.300 --> 00:20.633
Oh, poor Granny Primrose.

00:20.733 --> 00:21.900
How you feeling?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.167
I'm--

00:23.267 --> 00:25.433
Daddy mentioned
something about a bracelet.

00:25.533 --> 00:26.333
Bedside table.

00:34.033 --> 00:34.867
Do I get something?

00:34.967 --> 00:35.767
JENNY: Meg!

00:35.867 --> 00:37.400
Sorry.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.367
As it happens, she did
ask me to give you these.

00:44.233 --> 00:45.867
She's very tired.

00:45.967 --> 00:47.400
I think you better
go now, girls.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.333
Bye-bye, Granny.

00:49.433 --> 00:50.267
Bye, Granny.

00:55.433 --> 00:56.167
It's awful.

00:56.267 --> 00:58.733
I wish we could do something.

00:58.833 --> 00:59.767
I feel so helpless.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.800
Oh, come on.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.367
[theme song]

01:30.133 --> 01:31.600
BUNNY: Meg, come quick!

01:35.433 --> 01:36.400
What happened?

01:36.500 --> 01:37.767
What time is it?

01:37.867 --> 01:38.933
It's 4:00 AM.

01:39.033 --> 01:42.233
Guys, something
sensash has happened.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.600
Sensash like the time
Sabrina the Teenage Witch

01:44.700 --> 01:45.700
followed you on Twitter?

01:45.800 --> 01:47.233
It's about the
dead Granny money.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.667
Well, she's still alive, so
maybe don't call it that yet.

01:49.767 --> 01:53.467
I bought a humongous
pres-y for all three of us.

01:53.567 --> 01:57.167
So this weekend
we are going to--

01:57.267 --> 01:58.967
Please, be Center Parcs.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.333
Glastonbury!

02:00.433 --> 02:02.367
I just won the tickets on eBay.

02:02.467 --> 02:04.467
In your face, @MuffHunter69.

02:04.567 --> 02:05.900
No freaking way.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.633
I can't afford that.

02:07.733 --> 02:08.867
No, they're on me.

02:08.967 --> 02:10.333
I feel really guilty
about how good

02:10.433 --> 02:12.367
it feels being the favorite
best granddaughter.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.000
Plus, yes, you definitely
can't afford it.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.233
Thanks, but I
don't need charity.

02:16.333 --> 02:18.500
Well, just pay me back
in favors or whatever.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.967
I'd really feel more
comfortable paying

02:20.067 --> 02:21.167
you back in actual money.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.000
- They cost 1,000 pounds.
- Or favors.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.367
Favors is fine.
- Glastonbury.

02:24.467 --> 02:25.100
Glastonbury!

[music playing]

02:35.033 --> 02:36.200

02:36.300 --> 02:37.133

02:37.233 --> 02:38.133
Phone's broke.

02:38.233 --> 02:39.500
No, it's not.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.400
Tracy wants a word, and
that word might be "fired."

02:43.500 --> 02:45.800
Shit balls.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.067
Sorry I'm late.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.500
Me phone--

02:48.600 --> 02:49.833
How was Apocalash?

02:49.933 --> 02:52.500
You what?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.433
We follow all our
employees on social media.

02:54.533 --> 02:56.533
Yeah, but that weren't
the reason I were late.

02:56.633 --> 02:59.900
I'm going through a
very painful break up.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.833
With him?

03:02.933 --> 03:04.333
Or him?

03:04.433 --> 03:05.633
Final warning.

03:05.733 --> 03:07.900
One more strike and you're out.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.300
I'll make it up to you.

03:30.633 --> 03:33.033
MEG: Right, so this Glasto
packing list of yours,

03:33.133 --> 03:37.400
I've got glow sticks,
beads, sequins, glitter.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.967
Yeah, that's what I'm taking.

03:39.067 --> 03:40.067
Have you booked the transport?

03:40.167 --> 03:41.133
Yeah, I think
Hot & Cold's going

03:41.233 --> 03:42.633
to give us lift on Friday.

03:42.733 --> 03:44.700
He's lending us a tent, but
he's already text me saying,

03:44.800 --> 03:47.333
he can't wait to roll
around in the mud with me.

03:47.433 --> 03:49.600
God, I bet he's
got fit friends.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.367
Add Johnnys to the list.

I'm so sorry.

Meg, are you on the toilet?

04:19.833 --> 04:21.433
Sorry, I tried to say.

04:21.533 --> 04:23.800
Look, just get over
here when you can.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.467
There's lots I need you to do
for the funeral on Saturday.

[splashing stops]

04:27.367 --> 04:28.567
The funeral's on Saturday?

04:28.667 --> 04:29.967
JENNY (ON PHONE): Yes.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.700
No!

04:31.800 --> 04:33.667
Mm-- no!

04:33.767 --> 04:36.600
Ah, the grief.

04:36.700 --> 04:37.533
Yeah, OK.

04:37.633 --> 04:39.433
Bye, Mum.

04:39.533 --> 04:40.633
Has Granny died?

04:40.733 --> 04:41.800
And it gets worse.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.467
The funeral's on Saturday.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.133
No!

04:45.233 --> 04:47.067
Yeah.
Can you leave, mate?

04:47.167 --> 04:48.167
It's turning into a poo.

04:50.967 --> 04:53.233
- Kez-o.
- Why are you wearing goggles?

04:53.333 --> 04:56.033
Protection for all the
mud and beer flying around--

04:56.133 --> 04:57.233
and jizz, probably.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.067
Plus, they look cool.

04:59.167 --> 05:02.167
Hmm-- wow, someone's prepared.

05:02.267 --> 05:03.700
Got to be up on
your festival hacks.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.600
Ale?

05:04.700 --> 05:05.533
Check.

05:05.633 --> 05:06.800
Transport for said ale?

05:06.900 --> 05:08.200
Check.
Want one?

05:08.300 --> 05:09.400
We'll head down
Friday afternoon, get

05:09.500 --> 05:10.933
the best spot for Gary Gazebo.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.133
Still want a lift?

05:12.233 --> 05:14.300
Oh, well, I've got
a bit of a problem

05:14.400 --> 05:17.267
in that my Granny's died.

05:17.367 --> 05:18.367
Oh, yeah?

05:18.467 --> 05:19.933
Yeah.

05:20.033 --> 05:23.033
Yeah, the funeral
is on Saturday.

05:23.133 --> 05:25.300
You going to
sack it off, then?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.433
Probably.

05:26.533 --> 05:30.933
Your Gran's not going
to know, Kez she's dead.

05:31.033 --> 05:33.367
That's what she
would have wanted.

05:33.467 --> 05:40.100
She'd have wanted me to festival
fuck you from behind in a tent.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.833
Maybe not even in a tent.

05:41.933 --> 05:44.300
I've seen people at Glastonbury
just fucking in a field.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.600
I saw this one guy eat
a lass out in Stone

05:46.700 --> 05:47.967
Circle in front of everybody.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.600
Jesus.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.267
Do you want me to
bring any drugs, Kez?

05:51.367 --> 05:53.067
Oh, I don't really do drugs.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.867
Oh, you will do, Kez.

05:54.967 --> 05:56.100
You will.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.267
Nothing like dirty
festival sex on drugs.

05:58.367 --> 05:59.633
I usually drop on
the way down so

05:59.733 --> 06:01.500
I'm perfectly hard by
the time I hit the gates.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.467
Fuck.

06:02.567 --> 06:03.800
I'll bring the
tent and the drugs.

06:03.900 --> 06:07.467
You bring your a-game--

06:07.567 --> 06:08.400
and Johnnys.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.267
[music playing]

06:14.033 --> 06:17.000
It's just such
a shock, you know?

06:17.100 --> 06:19.600
I can't process it.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.367
One year we had tickets.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.167
Is it worth just
going for the Sunday?

06:23.267 --> 06:25.000
Of course it's not, Meg.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.200
All the hotties will we
be paired off by Sunday,

06:27.300 --> 06:30.567
and all that will be left
for us is twats in morphsuits

06:30.667 --> 06:34.500
and the foldy chair brigade.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.767
Oh, cheer up.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.033
Who died?

06:37.133 --> 06:37.933
Oh, shit.

06:38.033 --> 06:39.367
Is it your Gran?

06:39.467 --> 06:40.600
[inaudible]

06:40.700 --> 06:42.400
And there's bad news.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.633
We can't get go
to Glastonbury.

06:43.733 --> 06:44.800
It's the funeral.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.667
Right.

06:46.767 --> 06:47.800
Can I have your tickets?

06:47.900 --> 06:48.833
Unless--

06:48.933 --> 06:49.767
No, Meg.

06:49.867 --> 06:50.833
Well, I mean, come on.

06:50.933 --> 06:52.467
How close were we anyway?

06:52.567 --> 06:53.933
She left me half
a fucking tenner.

06:54.033 --> 06:55.967
Yeah, you don't owe her shit.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.700
[inaudible], Bun.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.033
You can't go without me.

06:59.133 --> 07:00.400
I bought the tickets.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.800
Just tell your mum and dad
that-- that we're sorry,

07:01.900 --> 07:02.733
but we're busy.

07:02.833 --> 07:03.667
Why do I have to do it?

07:03.767 --> 07:04.733
I own you.

07:04.833 --> 07:05.667
Remember?

07:08.600 --> 07:10.633
So, yeah, she went
peacefully in her sleep.

07:10.733 --> 07:14.533
With just a little
help towards the end.

07:14.633 --> 07:15.533
What do you mean, "help?"

07:15.633 --> 07:18.367
Just a couple of
extra sleepy pills

07:18.467 --> 07:20.833
to make sure there was no pain.

07:20.933 --> 07:22.167
All right, Dr. Shipman.

07:22.267 --> 07:25.333
Not strictly legal,
but, you know, the doctors

07:25.433 --> 07:26.800
usually turn a blind eye.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.067
There's a second autopsy
today and a police interview,

07:30.167 --> 07:32.100
which I'm sure is just
going to be a formality,

07:32.200 --> 07:33.967
so we need you both
to help us out.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.233
What, like an alibi?

07:35.333 --> 07:39.000
No, we need you two
to organize the funeral.

07:39.100 --> 07:39.933
Oh, no.

07:40.033 --> 07:40.833
Why?

07:40.933 --> 07:42.433
Oh, my god, why?

07:42.533 --> 07:43.367
Oh, why?

07:43.467 --> 07:48.067
She's very upset about Granny.

07:48.167 --> 07:51.067
Here's a controversial
idea, do we even

07:51.167 --> 07:53.233
really need a funeral anyway?

07:53.333 --> 07:56.600
I mean, they can just make
people feel worse, can't they?

07:56.700 --> 07:58.400
I thought I was in denial.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.967
Right, I've written down all the
instructions for you both here.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.367
We need you to step up, Meg.

08:03.467 --> 08:07.100
And will it be
necessary to attend

08:07.200 --> 08:09.200
on top of the organizing?

08:09.300 --> 08:12.333
Yeah, yeah, no, you
do have to attend

08:12.433 --> 08:13.800
your grandmother's funeral.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.167
Meg.

08:15.267 --> 08:17.633
Well, you do, mate,
Glastonbury tickets or not.

08:17.733 --> 08:20.433
You've got Glastonbury
tickets for this weekend?

08:20.533 --> 08:23.000
Which you'll be
sacrificing, because that's

08:23.100 --> 08:25.767
what grownups do.

08:25.867 --> 08:28.567
Yeah, that's-- that's
exactly what we're doing.

08:31.633 --> 08:34.067
[music playing]

08:38.933 --> 08:41.167
Nathan, what the fuck's this?

08:41.267 --> 08:42.333
Can you not swear at me?

08:42.433 --> 08:44.267
It's just, I am
your team leader.

08:44.367 --> 08:46.800
Sod, but there's no fucking
way I'm working this weekend.

08:46.900 --> 08:47.767
But it's not negotiable.

08:47.867 --> 08:48.667
You don't understand.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.567
It's important.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.100
I've got a funeral.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.767
Everyone knows you're
going to Glastonbury.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.167
I'm not.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.600
Stop stalking me on
social media anyway.

08:57.700 --> 08:58.833
We didn't have to.

08:58.933 --> 08:59.867
We've seen your desk.

08:59.967 --> 09:02.033
I sign for half this stuff.

09:02.133 --> 09:04.733
Plus, you're already
wearing your wellies.

09:04.833 --> 09:05.667
Is there a problem?

09:05.767 --> 09:07.067
Can't work this weekend.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.633
Got a funeral.

09:08.733 --> 09:09.800
Nice try.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.333
[music playing]

09:11.433 --> 09:12.367
I'll prove it.

09:12.467 --> 09:13.233
I swear.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.233
My Mam's dead as
fuck, all right?

09:18.500 --> 09:21.467
As this is a
non-religious ceremony,

09:21.567 --> 09:22.967
legally, there are
no requirements

09:23.067 --> 09:24.600
as to who runs the service.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.233
So if you have a family
member that could

09:27.333 --> 09:28.867
do a particularly good job?

09:28.967 --> 09:32.200
We can do it ourselves, and
it can be as short as we want?

09:32.300 --> 09:33.400
Yes.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.167
So do you want to confirm
for Saturday morning?

09:36.267 --> 09:39.067
Just out of interest, have
you got anything Friday?

09:39.167 --> 09:42.433
We can't change the
date of the funeral--

09:42.533 --> 09:43.567
can we?

09:43.667 --> 09:46.967
Actually, we do have
a slot Friday morning.

09:47.067 --> 09:49.100
Best day ever.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.133

Nathan's going to cover

10:04.600 --> 10:05.467
Of course.

10:05.567 --> 10:08.200
Obviously, take
you time to grieve.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.167
How much time will
that be exactly?

10:11.267 --> 10:14.100
As much time as you need.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.600
Thanks for understanding.

Can you wear
flip-flops to a funeral?

10:22.367 --> 10:24.167
Uh, maybe black ones.

10:24.267 --> 10:27.000
But it-- it's--
it's moved to Friday.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.833
I know it's-- it
is short notice.

10:28.933 --> 10:31.133
Sorry, Gerald.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.900
Yes, I'll be wearing
something nice.

OK, yeah.

Bunny, can you do anything
to help me at all.

10:48.133 --> 10:49.767
I'm sorry, Meg,
but if anything

10:49.867 --> 10:50.700
you should be helping me.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.800
You still owe me-- oh--

10:52.900 --> 10:54.300
a few hundred favors, at least.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.333
Now, headdress or
Pocahontas wig?

10:57.433 --> 10:59.567

everything goes to plan,

then we have just the right
amount of time to make it.

here to celebrate

didn't come to fool you.

I thought that love would
last forever: I was wrong.

now: put out every one;

Were you, now?

19:58.100 --> 19:59.133
Come with me.

20:02.633 --> 20:03.933
Look.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.700
Oh, hey, guys.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.567
Oh god, you both look great.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.500
Everything's going
to be fine, I think.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.367
I feel really good about
this whole situation.

20:12.467 --> 20:13.800
I feel amazing.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.767
What should we do?

20:15.867 --> 20:16.767
[car horn]

20:16.867 --> 20:19.600
Oh, shit, Pete's still waiting.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.433
What were we going to
before we got sidetracked?

20:22.533 --> 20:24.600
We were getting
ready to leave.

20:24.700 --> 20:27.133
[music playing]

20:46.500 --> 20:47.800
You look nice.

20:53.900 --> 20:56.400
[music playing]

20:59.467 --> 21:02.367
[music playing]

21:26.833 --> 21:28.433
Glastonbury!

21:28.533 --> 21:31.767
FRANK: Well, that's
a disappointment.

21:31.867 --> 21:35.167
Listen, Meg, if you want to
mourn your grandmother's death

21:35.267 --> 21:38.467
by assing about in
piss-soaked mud,

21:38.567 --> 21:43.000
drinking overpriced flat cider,
and listening to DJ Shite,

21:43.100 --> 21:44.333
well, that's fine by me.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.100
Yes, we are going to
go and dance in a field

21:46.200 --> 21:48.067
to poorly amplified music.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.900
And at least one of those
will have unprotected sex.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.033
Probably me.

21:52.133 --> 21:53.667
What's all the commotion?

21:53.767 --> 21:55.600
She's going to Glastonbury.

21:55.700 --> 21:56.767
What?

21:56.867 --> 21:58.433
[car horn]

21:58.533 --> 22:00.333
Did you change the
day of the funeral

22:00.433 --> 22:01.933
so you could go to Glastonbury?

22:02.033 --> 22:04.967
Did you euthanize my
grandmother to death?

22:05.067 --> 22:07.300
So, yeah, we're going
to go to Glastonbury.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.733
And you know what you've done.

22:21.733 --> 22:23.000
What?

22:23.100 --> 22:25.033
These are from 2014.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.500
So?

22:29.600 --> 22:32.433
It is 2014, isn't it?

22:32.533 --> 22:34.333
Isn't it?

22:34.433 --> 22:35.900
Oh, my god.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.800
Laters, then.

22:41.700 --> 22:42.933
HOT & COLD: Laters.

22:43.033 --> 22:46.100
JENNY: Oh, that has
cheered me right up.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.900
Let's crack a bottle.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.333
Do you want to go back
and sit in the bathroom?

22:51.433 --> 22:52.267
Yeah.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.567
Just keep you
away from Jell-o.

22:54.667 --> 22:57.367
