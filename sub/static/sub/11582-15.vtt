In the criminal justice system,

00:03.237 --> 00:04.738
sexually based offenses

00:04.772 --> 00:07.075
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.377
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.410 --> 00:11.212
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.245 --> 00:12.746
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.780 --> 00:14.648
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.317
These are their stories.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.221
(man)
If you point
your telescopes north,

00:20.254 --> 00:23.357
you can just make out
Cancer, the Crab.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.294
And just below it
is Ursa Major,

00:26.327 --> 00:29.097
also known
as the great bear.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.133
(boy)
I got something
great and bare

00:32.166 --> 00:33.601
right here.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.204
Let me see, let me see.
Let go!

00:37.638 --> 00:39.307
I can't see her.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.176
Emmet,
she's right there.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.312
(man)
You're supposed to be
looking at the sky,

00:44.345 --> 00:46.514
not spying on people.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.249
Whoa.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.551
What's the matter?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.586
I think she's dead.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.364
A bunch of scouts

01:03.397 --> 01:05.833
stargazing from the roof
up there spotted her.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.335
They're looking down
to see stars?

01:07.368 --> 01:09.537
More like peeping
at other heavenly bodies.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.305
Never got
that merit badge.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.306
How'd you I.D. her?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.308
Found her bag in the alley
next to the building.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.310
Perp tossed it over the side,
cleaned it out first,

01:16.344 --> 01:17.778
but missed
her driver's license.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.748
(Stabler)
Allison Downey.
Address in Yonkers.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.416
Must be a good one.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.652
This is an $800 dress.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.321
(Benson)
Out on the town,
picked up the wrong guy.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.757
Who cracked her skull
with something blunt and heavy.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.293
We didn't recover the weapon.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.093
Fluids?
None.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.695
But her panties
are pulled down

01:34.728 --> 01:37.165
and there's trauma
to her vaginal area.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.332
How long
has she been dead?

01:38.366 --> 01:40.334
Based on body temp
and the cold weather,

01:40.368 --> 01:42.570
I'd say between 20,
24 hours.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.239
That's last night
between 8:00 and midnight.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.907
There's no drag marks.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.444
And if you used a gun
or a knife to force her up here,

01:50.478 --> 01:53.547
why use a blunt object
to kill her?

01:53.581 --> 01:55.783
Okay.
She must have known him.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.252
They came up
to the roof to have sex.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.620
She changes her mind,
he rapes her,

01:59.653 --> 02:00.721
clocks her,

02:00.754 --> 02:02.356
tries to make it
look like a robbery.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.425
Both roof doors are
locked from the inside.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.427
Maybe our perp's
someone from the building.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.897
Have Munch and Fin
do a canvass.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.865
We'll do notification.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.802
It's my daughter.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.437
It's Allison.

02:16.470 --> 02:20.641
Mrs. Downey, we are
very sorry for your loss.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.475
Can you tell us

02:21.509 --> 02:23.777
when the last time
you saw Allison was?

02:23.811 --> 02:26.647
Yesterday morning.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.951
She's been living with us
since she graduated college.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.620
But she often
goes into the city

02:32.653 --> 02:34.455
to stay with friends
overnight.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.624
Did she tell you
who they were?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.359
I didn't ask.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.793
Did she have a boyfriend?

02:39.827 --> 02:42.463
A guy she met
at school.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.765
He lives in Boston.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.500
Mrs. Downey,
can you tell us how

02:46.534 --> 02:47.668
we can get in touch
with your husband?

02:47.701 --> 02:49.270
[doorknob rattles]

02:49.303 --> 02:50.938
Oh, God, it's him.
I can't tell him.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.873
I can't tell him.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.512
Mom?

02:58.546 --> 03:00.448
Allison?

03:00.481 --> 03:02.583
Oh, God!

03:02.616 --> 03:03.917
Oh, God!

03:03.951 --> 03:05.719
They said you were dead!

03:05.753 --> 03:08.322
They said you were dead.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.857
[sobbing]

04:01.509 --> 04:03.277
Where did you find
my license?

04:03.311 --> 04:04.812
In the purse
of a murder victim

04:04.845 --> 04:06.780
in Manhattan.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.916
Any idea how it
could have gotten there?

04:08.949 --> 04:11.752
I lost it.
I had to get a new one.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.788
Elliot.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.990
Check this out.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.893
Who's this
in the picture with you?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.529
My cousin Lisa.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.830
(Stabler)
Where does she live?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.598
In Queens.
Glen Oaks.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.467
Could she have
taken your license?

04:28.068 --> 04:30.338
No.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.506
I mean, it's possible.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.743
Lisa's younger
than you are, isn't she?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.879
She just turned 15.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.449
You gave her
your license.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.354
[crying]
I'm sorry.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.857
She was going out
with this college guy.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.526
And he was into music,
and she begged me for my license

04:52.560 --> 04:54.395
so she could
get into clubs with him.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.497
She didn't do drugs,
never got in trouble.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.398
I thought it was okay.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.434
This, uh, college guy--
you know his name?

05:00.468 --> 05:02.470
She never told me.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.740
(Warner)
Cause of death is a massive
cerebral hemorrhage

05:06.774 --> 05:08.409
due to blunt force trauma.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.411
Crime Scene still hasn't
found the murder weapon.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.779
Any idea
what we're looking for?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.448
Something metallic
with a rounded end.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.983
Ball-peen hammer?

05:16.016 --> 05:17.951
There were metal fragments
in the wound.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.920
I sent samples over
to a metallurgist.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.589
Hopefully, he can
narrow it down for us.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.956
How old's this bruise?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.725
I'd say about
four to six weeks.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.528
Somebody gave her
one hell of a black eye.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.996
Probably why she had on
so much makeup.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.598
That, and she wanted
to look grownup.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.533
She's 15 years old.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.402
What kind of parents
let their kid go out clubbing

05:34.435 --> 05:35.803
on a school night?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.438
Ask her father.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.472
He's here.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.415
[crying]
It's Lisa.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.418
Oh, God, my baby!

05:50.451 --> 05:51.819
Lisa.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.622
[sobbing]

05:54.655 --> 05:56.590
Who'd do this?

05:56.624 --> 05:58.659
(Stabler)
We're still investigating.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.461
You find
the son of a bitch.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.565
Do you know where Lisa was
Monday night

06:04.598 --> 06:05.666
between 8:00
and midnight?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.436
I talked to her
that afternoon.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.804
She said she
was going out...

06:10.838 --> 06:14.174
for pizza
with some friends.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.746
When was the last time
you saw Lisa?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.515
Monday morning.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.116
Before I left.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.685
I'm a truck driver.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.854
18-wheeler.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.889
You remember
what she was wearing?

06:28.922 --> 06:31.391
Her school uniform.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.127
You sure about that?

06:36.163 --> 06:39.967
You don't think I know
what my kid wears to school?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.435
It's just that when
we found Lisa,

06:41.469 --> 06:44.705
she was wearing
an $800 cocktail dress.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.207
You know anything
about that?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.110
No!

06:50.143 --> 06:52.846
Her cousin said that she was
dating an older guy.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.517
Lisa never told me
she had a boyfriend.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.685
(Stabler)
Her mother know?

06:57.718 --> 07:00.187
Her mother died
nine months ago.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.097
[sobbing]

07:12.900 --> 07:14.535
I checked
Lisa's attendance.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.837
She went to all
of her classes on Monday.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.539
Last kid you'd think
something like this

07:18.572 --> 07:19.807
could happen to.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.874
Why's that?

07:20.908 --> 07:23.176
When her mother died,
Lisa took over the household.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.512
She cooked, cleaned,

07:24.545 --> 07:26.146
and still managed
to get good grades.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.148
She kept it together,
even though her mother was gone,

07:28.181 --> 07:29.850
and her father
was never around.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.685
Guy's gotta
make a living.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.487
Of course,
but so many parents

07:33.521 --> 07:34.755
work such long hours,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.490
they're too tired
to deal with their children.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.625
When kids don't get

07:37.658 --> 07:39.226
the attention
and affection they need,

07:39.259 --> 07:40.828
they look for it elsewhere.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.830
You think Lisa
was one of those kids?

07:42.863 --> 07:44.031
I don't think so.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.899
The only time
I ever had to call her in

07:45.933 --> 07:47.134
was over
the sex bracelets,

07:47.167 --> 07:48.736
and I'm sure that
was just peer pressure.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.604
Sex bracelets?

07:50.638 --> 07:52.606
Different colored bracelets
the girls wear,

07:52.640 --> 07:55.943
signaling which sex acts
they're willing to perform.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.712
Uh, yellow's hugging,
purple's kissing,

07:58.746 --> 08:01.148
red is for a lap dance,

08:01.181 --> 08:02.650
blue is for oral sex,

08:02.683 --> 08:05.719
and don't make me
say what black is for.

08:05.753 --> 08:06.987
And Lisa
was wearing 'em?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.589
Well, all the girls
in her grade were.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.223
But to be honest with you,
I don't know

08:10.257 --> 08:11.925
which girls were doing it
and which ones weren't.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.527
Well, who would
know about Lisa?

08:13.561 --> 08:15.062
Ask Angela Agnelli.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.831
She was Lisa's
best friend.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.600
The bracelets were just
a stupid joke.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.201
We all wore them.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.703
I called them
sex bracelets,

08:22.736 --> 08:24.705
and all of a sudden
it was like this big thing

08:24.738 --> 08:25.606
with the boys.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.774
What boys?

08:26.807 --> 08:28.642
Just some guys
in our class.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.010
They started
calling us sluts

08:30.043 --> 08:31.745
because we weren't
interested in them.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.647
So Lisa didn't
have a boyfriend?

08:33.681 --> 08:35.182
None of us do.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.684
Boys are way too immature,
[cell phone rings]

08:36.717 --> 08:38.218
and, anyway,
we're too busy.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.653
Doing what?

08:39.687 --> 08:40.520
Studying.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.690
Lisa was really
focused on college.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.324
It's what her mom wanted.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.226
Can I go?
I've got Spanish.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.561
Sure.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.129
Thanks.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.898
How many teenage girls
do you know

08:50.931 --> 08:52.600
who are too busy
to have boyfriends?

08:52.633 --> 08:53.634
None.
That was T.A.R.U.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.168
Morales has something.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.639
(Morales)
Lisa's BlackBerry.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.940
(Benson)
Where'd you find it?

08:59.973 --> 09:02.075
Dumpster back of the building
next to where she was murdered.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.243
Tossing it in the dumpster

09:03.276 --> 09:04.745
shouldn't cause
that much damage.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.880
I think your perp
tap-danced on the thing first.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.582
Didn't want us
to find his name on it.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.917
Unfortunately,
water or some other liquid

09:09.950 --> 09:11.752
got inside and fried
the CPU.

09:11.785 --> 09:12.720
So how do you know
it's Lisa's?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.588
The flash memory card
was pretty beat up,

09:14.622 --> 09:15.989
but I was able
to extract some data.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.791
Mostly stuff you'd expect
from teenagers.

09:17.825 --> 09:22.262
One place she went
I think you'd find interesting.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.931
(Stabler)
hotpersonals.net?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.599
(Morales)
Teen singles web site.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.901
I got Lisa's username
and accessed her profile.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.771
"Likes:
Tattoos and six-packs.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.673
Dislikes:
Piercings, ugly guys."

09:32.706 --> 09:34.274
I also found
some of her emails.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.844
Lisa's handle
is Queens Teen.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.380
"Queens Teen: I'm so bored.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.950
"Quick Nick: Me too.
Wanna hook up?

09:42.983 --> 09:45.052
Queens Teen: We can play
Bill and Monica again."

09:45.085 --> 09:46.720
(Morales)
Nick's not the only one.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.689
There are others--
lots of others.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.390
Her dad's on the road
all the time.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.759
She's got the whole
house alone.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.293
Pretty much do
whatever she wants.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.295
Any idea who
this Quick Nick is?

09:55.328 --> 09:56.630
I got his name
from the site's webmaster.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.766
Neighbor of Lisa's
out in Queens.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.701
Nicky Sims.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.135
Lisa who?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.937
Oh, yeah.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.039
Yeah, I hooked up
with her for a while,

10:06.073 --> 10:07.307
but that was, like,
months ago.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.341
Hooked up?

10:08.375 --> 10:09.677
Yeah, you know.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.979
You do it
with no strings attached.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.380
Friends with benefits.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.216
Okay, so why did
the benefits stop?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.285
'Cause Lisa got bored.
Said it was time to move on.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.753
How long were you two dating?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.855
Only ugly people date.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.323
Look, I gotta fly--

10:23.356 --> 10:25.158
And you didn't care
that she dumped you?

10:25.192 --> 10:28.662
No. I was hooking up with,
like, three other girls anyway.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.664
Who else was Lisa
hooking up with?

10:30.698 --> 10:31.865
Practically
every cute guy at school.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.233
The girl was on a mission.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.735
And you weren't?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.970
I'm more into girls.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.973
Lisa was for a while, too,
when she got tired of boys.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.208
How long did that last?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.743
Until she started doing
the older guys

10:42.776 --> 10:44.745
she met on the Internet.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.379
She wasn't scared
of having sex

10:46.413 --> 10:47.848
with people
that she didn't know?

10:47.881 --> 10:49.683
Why would she be?

10:49.717 --> 10:51.218
You chat with them
online first,

10:51.251 --> 10:52.986
and you can
check their profiles.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.222
Lisa was looking
for mature men.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.757
She find any?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.826
Yeah, she really
liked one.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.960
You know his name?

10:59.993 --> 11:04.664
No, but Lisa's friend
Angela might.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.136
Sweet.

11:11.772 --> 11:12.740
Hi.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.075
You forgot to mention
that Lisa was hooking up

11:15.108 --> 11:17.410
with half of Queens.

11:17.444 --> 11:21.148
Because she wasn't
doing that anymore.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.083
You dress up like that
to do your homework?

11:23.116 --> 11:25.385
Everyone dresses like this.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.220
Including Lisa.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.089
So what?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.891
So you lied to us.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.962
I'm sorry, I just--

11:34.995 --> 11:37.497
I didn't want you guys to think
that she was a slut

11:37.530 --> 11:38.866
and tell her dad.

11:38.899 --> 11:39.967
Who is the older guy

11:40.000 --> 11:42.302
that she met online?

11:43.771 --> 11:45.272
It was a college student.

11:45.305 --> 11:49.409
He took her to some clubs,
got her some clothes.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.278
He was rich.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.014
She was really into him until
he started getting jealous.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.349
About what?

11:56.383 --> 11:59.486
Her hooking up
with other guys.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.789
Got so mad,
he hit her once.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.992
Did she tell you that?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.359
No.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.328
But she had
this big, black eye,

12:08.361 --> 12:09.930
and she said
she ran into a door.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.032
But I knew he hit her.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.967
What's this guy's name?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.370
Andy Wall.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.172
I don't know
any Lisa.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.941
Well, maybe you know her
as Allison Downey.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.242
That's not her name?

12:22.275 --> 12:23.476
She used
her cousin's license

12:23.510 --> 12:24.912
to get into clubs
with you.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.314
She was only 15.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.849
Oh, my God.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.083
But she's dead?

12:30.117 --> 12:31.251
How?

12:31.284 --> 12:34.354
Somebody beat the hell
out of her.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.790
You think I killed her?

12:36.824 --> 12:38.826
I would never hurt her.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.894
We split up.
I haven't seen her in months.

12:40.928 --> 12:41.895
You're still
talking to her.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.997
We dumped your phones.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.565
You called her
the day she died.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.868
Friends talk to each other.
So, what,
you bash her head in

12:47.901 --> 12:50.037
when you
ran out of words?
No, I didn't hurt her!

12:50.070 --> 12:52.039
Now, we hear
that you got so worked up

12:52.072 --> 12:53.941
when you found out about
all the guys she was doing

12:53.974 --> 12:55.375
that you
smacked her around.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.443
I loved her.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.510
Pissed you off then

12:57.544 --> 12:59.046
when she broke up
with you.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.547
That's not what happened.
I dumped her.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.149
But you loved her.
Why dump her?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.284
Because when I confronted her
about the other guys,

13:04.317 --> 13:06.920
she acted like I was
the one with the problem.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.389
I never hit her,
and I swear I didn't kill her.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.557
Where were you Monday night

13:10.590 --> 13:12.159
between 8:00 and midnight?

13:12.192 --> 13:13.593
I was studying
for a mid-term.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.162
Anyone vouch for that?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.463
Yeah,
my whole study group.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.399
I was there
till 3:00 in the morning.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.836
Cramming for an exam
on Camus' The Stranger.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.872
Same story
from all five study buddies.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.940
Lisa slept with guys
she met on the Internet.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.542
Killer could be anywhere.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.045
You know, when we were kids,
our parents told us

13:32.079 --> 13:34.214
that we were too young
to date just one person.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.316
Now you pray your kids
only date one person.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.986
I'm sure Lisa's father
would agree.

13:39.019 --> 13:39.887
What now?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.421
Warner called.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.524
Lisa had HIV.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.429
Every kid she slept with's
been exposed.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.235
A third of sexually active
teens in this country

13:55.268 --> 13:57.905
have a sexually transmitted
infection.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.040
So any one of the boys
Lisa was hooking up with

14:00.073 --> 14:01.108
could have infected her.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.110
And ever other girl
he had sex with.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.344
That's a lot of kids
at risk.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.246
More than
you can imagine.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.415
This is a model used
by the CDC

14:08.448 --> 14:10.250
to calculate
the spread of HIV

14:10.283 --> 14:11.518
in urban areas.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.420
Once there are
a certain number of carriers,

14:13.453 --> 14:15.455
which we call
critical mass,

14:15.488 --> 14:17.090
the disease begins to spread
exponentially

14:17.124 --> 14:18.992
among those
who don't use condoms.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.527
The red dots
on the screen

14:20.560 --> 14:24.231
represent each person
infected in just one week.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.100
And that's
after two weeks.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.002
Now imagine that happening
in one part of Queens.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.171
We're talking
about an epidemic.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.907
Any way to get
the names of those red dots?

14:33.941 --> 14:36.209
Each HIV infection
has to be reported,

14:36.243 --> 14:38.111
but the names
are kept anonymous.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.113
But I made a list
of Lisa's partners

14:40.147 --> 14:43.116
from her web pages
and the interviews you did.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.218
The health department will
notify the ones they can locate.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.420
If Lisa confronted
the guy who gave her HIV,

14:47.454 --> 14:49.923
maybe he murdered her
to keep it a secret.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.025
Did she even know
that she was positive?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.160
Yes.

14:53.193 --> 14:57.197
Lab found traces of Combivir
and D-four-T in her blood.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.432
Someone was prescribing her
anti-retrovirals.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.934
So we find this doctor.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.269
Maybe he knows
who infected her.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.639
What?

15:08.141 --> 15:10.210
I know one of these boys.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.616
(Stabler)
Kathleen.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.219
Uh, see you later.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.621
Dad, what are you
doing here?

15:21.654 --> 15:24.191
I need to talk with you.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.026
You and mom
are getting a divorce?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.694
No, no, no.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.729
I wouldn't tell you
this way, anyway.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.199
That boy Jed that you
were going out with--

15:32.232 --> 15:33.266
what's his last name?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.301
Uh, Baldwin.
Why?

15:34.334 --> 15:36.003
When did you
go out with him?

15:36.036 --> 15:37.470
A couple of months ago.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.240
Why are you
asking me this?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.242
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.610
Okay.

15:43.643 --> 15:47.214
But...did you
do anything with him?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.182
You mean did we have sex?

15:49.216 --> 15:50.017
Yes.
That's private.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.185
I know.
Then why
are you asking me?

15:52.219 --> 15:52.952
I can't tell you.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.487
So then why
should I tell you?

15:54.521 --> 15:57.190
Because I'm your father,
and it's really important.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.195
I didn't have sex
with Jed.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.563
Did you do anything else
with him?

16:03.596 --> 16:05.598
No, that's why
he broke up with me.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.966
Because I wouldn't.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.438
You okay, Dad?

16:11.471 --> 16:12.739
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.275
I'm fine.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.178
I love you.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.015
I'll pick you up
Saturday.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.154
You're welcome
to take a look,

16:27.187 --> 16:29.189
but your people
already searched the room.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.258
Mr. Downey...

16:31.291 --> 16:33.726
has Lisa been
to the doctor lately?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.629
No, our, um,
medical insurance

16:36.663 --> 16:38.265
was through
my wife's job.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.799
We lost it when she died.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.234
Why?

16:41.268 --> 16:44.037
Traces of two medications

16:44.071 --> 16:47.440
were found
in Lisa's blood.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.042
She never told me
she was sick.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.310
She didn't
want you to know.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.412
She had HIV.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.317
Oh, God.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.356
Who gave it to her?
We don't know.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.757
That's what we're
trying to find out.

17:04.791 --> 17:08.495
Have you noticed any
pill bottles around the house?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.063
No.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.434
We only got
one medicine cabinet

17:14.467 --> 17:16.103
in the bathroom.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.171
I would have
seen them.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.540
Mr. Downey...

17:20.573 --> 17:22.642
did Lisa have a job?

17:22.675 --> 17:25.345
She was supposed to be
studying, not working.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.080
Why?

17:27.114 --> 17:31.284
This closet is filled
with designer clothes.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.386
Thousands of dollars worth.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.724
Her allowance
was 25 bucks a week.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.228
Any idea who
bought her these?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.562
I don't know.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.433
It's like I don't
know anything about her.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.407
Most of her clothes come from
a place called Her Boutique.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.076
Elliot...

18:00.413 --> 18:02.615
D-four-T.
Combivir.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.484
Prescribed
by Dr. Derek Tanner,

18:04.517 --> 18:06.286
Whitestone
Hospital Center.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.624
Lisa was just in here
last week for a follow-up.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.661
I, um, saw her picture
in the paper.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.263
Do you know
who killed her?

18:16.296 --> 18:18.265
Well, we're hoping that
you can help us find out.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.833
Now, do you know
how Lisa got exposed?

18:20.867 --> 18:23.236
You know HIV information
is confidential.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.737
But, Dr. Tanner,
we have reason to believe

18:24.771 --> 18:26.206
that Lisa
was sexually active

18:26.239 --> 18:27.607
with a very large
number of partners.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.342
I told her
to contact all of them.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.410
I referred her
for counseling.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.844
I did everything
I could legally do.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.646
But I couldn't
force her to do any of it.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.814
Right, now,
what about the people

18:34.847 --> 18:35.648
she may have infected?

18:35.682 --> 18:38.318
Look, get a release
from Lisa's father

18:38.351 --> 18:39.786
and I'll tell you
everything I can.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.421
I want to help you,
I do.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.423
But I have
to protect my patients.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.294
Lisa didn't
have insurance,

18:47.327 --> 18:48.895
so she had to pay
for the medication

18:48.928 --> 18:50.297
and all those clothes?

18:50.330 --> 18:51.498
Must have cost her
thousands of dollars.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.933
I bet college boy Andy
wasn't so generous.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.768
Maybe she had
a sugar daddy.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.670
We can start with the bags
in her closet

18:57.704 --> 18:59.506
from Her Boutique.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.876
That's the dress
Lisa was wearing.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.778
Uh, can I
help you?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.380
Yeah, police.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.682
Can you tell us if you've
seen this girl in your store?

19:09.716 --> 19:12.285
I don't remember her.
We get a lot of customers.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.288
Has any one of them
bought this dress recently?

19:15.322 --> 19:17.390
I'll look.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.428
Last one we sold
was Monday.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.695
Paid for
with a credit card?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.431
Cash, but I wasn't
working then.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.233
So I really
can't help you.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.734
Do you have
a surveillance system?

19:30.470 --> 19:31.538
(Stabler)
There's Lisa.

19:31.571 --> 19:34.974
(woman)
Sale was registered
at 11:10 A.M.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.309
Who's the guy?

19:36.343 --> 19:37.810
Brian.
He's one of the managers.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.913
Where's she going?

19:40.947 --> 19:43.182
Probably to the fitting rooms,
back here.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.653
He's going with her.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.488
I've never had a male manager
help me try on clothes.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.522
Can you fast forward?

19:49.556 --> 19:50.723
Sure.

19:55.762 --> 19:56.763
Stop.
Stop.

19:56.796 --> 20:00.267
Right there.
There she is.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.869
Time code says they were gone
for over 10 minutes.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.003
That's weird.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.338
Sales in the system,

20:05.372 --> 20:07.006
but she never
went near the register.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.508
Maybe Brian
bought it for her.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.009
Is he working today?

20:10.042 --> 20:12.745
He's taking sales inventory
in the stock room.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.519
[man groaning]

20:19.552 --> 20:21.454
What's that
sound like to you?

20:21.488 --> 20:24.491
[groaning continues]

20:27.694 --> 20:28.795
Yo! Brian!

20:28.828 --> 20:31.464
Hey!
Hey, hey.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.699
You're in trouble.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.534
Elliot.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.840
Angela.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.584
I don't see
what you're so upset about.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.920
You're selling yourself
for clothes.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.855
No, I'm not.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.857
Brian just likes
to buy me pretty things.

20:57.890 --> 20:58.991
Yeah, in exchange
for sex.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.393
Have a seat.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.695
I do not have sex
with him.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.765
No? Then what do you call
what you did to Brian?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.734
It's only oral.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.869
Oral sex, Angela.

21:09.902 --> 21:10.903
So what?

21:10.937 --> 21:13.373
It's the same thing
I usually do when I hooked up.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.442
At least this way,
I get something out of it.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.610
Louis Vuitton bag,
Prada shoes,

21:17.644 --> 21:18.845
Dolce & Gabbana top.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.547
That's at least
two grand right there.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.484
You're telling me that one guy
spent that much on you?

21:24.517 --> 21:28.087
It's not like
I do this all the time.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.789
You want to wind up
like Lisa?

21:31.824 --> 21:33.092
No.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.861
So she was hooking
at the mall with you, right?

21:34.894 --> 21:37.630
Yes.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.999
Until she started
using the hotel.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.301
What hotel?

21:43.836 --> 21:45.905
The Barrington.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.074
She used to bring me
little soaps

21:48.107 --> 21:49.542
and shampoos.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.912
When did she start
turning tricks at the hotel?

21:52.945 --> 21:54.881
Couple months ago.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.583
But I never did.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.784
You still use the stock room.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.486
I only
did it for clothes!

21:59.519 --> 22:01.454
But Lisa
was way into it!

22:01.488 --> 22:02.288
Especially after the guy

22:02.321 --> 22:03.856
told us how much
money we could make.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.525
What guy?

22:08.027 --> 22:09.996
He picked us up
at the mall.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.732
We were--we were
window shopping.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.835
That's how we got guys
to buy us stuff and--

22:15.868 --> 22:18.405
He said that we could
make some real money

22:18.438 --> 22:19.939
at this hotel.

22:19.972 --> 22:20.940
He works there?

22:23.009 --> 22:25.512
At the front desk.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.880
I think his name
was Jerome.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.555
Here's your room key,
Mr. Stabler.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.491
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

22:38.525 --> 22:39.826
Well, you know,
I'll tell ya,

22:39.859 --> 22:43.029
I'm, uh, a little stiff
after my long flight.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.565
How about a massage?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.167
How much for your best one?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.002
Well, that can be
quite expensive.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.504
Well, that's not a problem.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.639
You just make sure
that she's young

22:52.672 --> 22:53.940
and good
at what she does.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.608
I think I can find
what you're looking for

22:55.642 --> 22:57.510
in, say, half an hour?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.979
[knock on door]

23:00.012 --> 23:01.914
Hi.
I'm Brandy.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.550
You're late.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.785
I wanted to look
pretty for you.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.087
You're awfully cute.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.690
[clicks tongue]

23:10.723 --> 23:12.425
So how much?

23:12.459 --> 23:14.594
300...an hour.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.128
2,000
for the whole night.

23:16.162 --> 23:19.499
[both chuckle]

23:21.601 --> 23:22.835
Two, three.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.841
I gotta ask you something.
Why do you do this?

23:28.875 --> 23:31.544
God, you're not
one of those, are you?

23:31.578 --> 23:32.979
No, I'm one of these.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.014
Crap!

23:35.047 --> 23:37.917
Can't interest you
in a freebie?

23:37.950 --> 23:38.951
Not tonight.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.153
So, Brandy,

23:41.187 --> 23:42.589
tell me...

23:42.622 --> 23:44.056
What's Jerome's cut?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.224
What do you think I am,

23:45.257 --> 23:47.193
a pimp?
You bet.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.962
Okay, so the girls
throw me a 20 once in a while.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.464
You're recruiting them
from shopping malls.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.566
Brandy says that you
take 70%.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.967
You gonna bust my balls
for something that happens

23:55.001 --> 23:56.503
in every hotel
in the country?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.137
And you're gonna tell me
every hotel in the country

23:58.170 --> 23:59.572
has child prostitution?

23:59.606 --> 24:01.608
What are you talking about?
Brandy's 19.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.709
Yeah?

24:02.742 --> 24:03.976
This girl was 15.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.912
Never seen her before.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.213
Why don't you take
a better look,

24:07.246 --> 24:09.015
unless you want your
high-class hotel to find out

24:09.048 --> 24:10.082
you're being questioned
for murder?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.651
Murder--Allison's dead?

24:11.684 --> 24:12.885
Oh, well,
now he knows her.

24:12.919 --> 24:13.953
Her name's Lisa.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.823
Haven't seen her
for months.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.791
Were any of your guests
particularly fond of her?

24:18.825 --> 24:20.126
There's one guy
always asked for her.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.260
Didn't want to see
anyone else.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.662
(Benson)
Can you describe him?

24:22.695 --> 24:23.963
Early '30s,
reddish-blonde.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.632
Good-looking guy.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.501
First time he stayed with us
was for a medical convention.

24:28.535 --> 24:29.636
Derek Tanner?

24:29.669 --> 24:32.038
Yeah.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.806
Dr. Tanner's
with a patient right now.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.608
[crash]
What was that?

24:35.642 --> 24:37.777
(Mr. Downey)
You're gonna tell me
what I wanna know!

24:37.810 --> 24:38.945
Oh, damn it.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.012
(Tanner)
I don't know anything!

24:40.046 --> 24:41.714
You knew Lisa had HIV!

24:41.748 --> 24:43.115
That's enough!

24:43.149 --> 24:45.084
Mr. Downey!
He's crazy!

24:45.117 --> 24:46.586
Inside, let's go!
In here.

24:46.619 --> 24:47.920
I want him charged.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.689
Yeah, well, you're the one
who's gonna be charged.

24:49.722 --> 24:50.857
With what?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.792
Having sex with
his 15-year-old daughter.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.195
What is it?
You wanna go to jail too?

24:56.228 --> 24:58.197
I want to find the guy
who killed my little girl!

24:58.230 --> 25:00.232
That is my job,
and you're gonna let us do it!

25:00.266 --> 25:02.535
And the next time,
I'm gonna lock you up!

25:02.569 --> 25:04.070
Lisa's gone, my wife's gone!

25:04.103 --> 25:07.840
What difference does it make
what happens to me?!

25:14.146 --> 25:17.016
I have seen
a lot of good people

25:17.049 --> 25:20.820
who have lost everything.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.155
Thought they had nothing
left to live for

25:23.189 --> 25:24.924
after a loved one's murder.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.193
But you gotta keep going.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.996
Think about Lisa.
Your wife.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.065
Would they want to see you
sitting in prison?

25:33.099 --> 25:36.002
You can get through this.

25:39.138 --> 25:42.842
Have you got a priest
you can talk to?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.111
[scoffs]
Yeah, I guess.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.081
What about Dr. Tanner?

25:49.115 --> 25:51.651
I'll deal with him.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.187
How'd it feel?

25:55.221 --> 25:56.889
How'd it feel?
Get off me!

25:56.923 --> 25:58.357
Screwing a 15-year-old.
You like that?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.126
I didn't know she was 15.
You're a liar!

26:00.159 --> 26:01.360
You were
banging her for weeks!

26:01.393 --> 26:02.762
Come on.
She came on to me.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.063
Where,
the high school?

26:04.096 --> 26:05.998
I was in town from Providence
for a convention.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.100
She approached me
in the hotel lobby.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.235
She was beautiful.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.670
She was 15!

26:10.703 --> 26:12.639
She said that she was 21!

26:12.672 --> 26:15.074
Look, I never
paid for sex before.

26:15.107 --> 26:18.745
But that night I did,
and it was incredible.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.715
You're pathetic.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.150
I couldn't stop seeing her.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.284
I was addicted.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.319
So why'd you kill her?
I didn't.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.888
You knew she had HIV.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.190
You knew your love affair
would come out sometime.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.291
You think I care
about that?

26:32.324 --> 26:35.227
I quit my job to move here
so I could be with her.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.864
I gave her everything
that she wanted!

26:37.897 --> 26:40.232
I loved her.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.977
[grunting]

26:57.116 --> 26:58.651
[door closes]

27:01.888 --> 27:03.189
You okay?

27:03.222 --> 27:04.356
Yep.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.694
[grunt]

27:07.727 --> 27:10.730
[panting]

27:13.800 --> 27:15.702
What a world.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.169
Same as always.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.641
No, things have changed.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.812
Maybe you have.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.019
Yeah, maybe.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.234
You lose a family, whew.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.472
That's when it all starts
to disintegrate.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.075
Elliot...

27:56.108 --> 27:58.210
you have great kids.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.316
That's what
Lisa's father thought.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.921
Check out Dr. Tanner's
alibi?

28:08.955 --> 28:10.256
We had to let him go.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.258
Hospital said he worked
a night shift on Monday.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.293
It's almost impossible
for him to get away for an hour

28:14.326 --> 28:15.461
to kill Lisa.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.196
Yeah, well, he did
claim that he loved her.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.197
Really?

28:18.230 --> 28:20.166
Then why was he about
to go back to his family

28:20.199 --> 28:22.068
in Rhode Island?

28:22.101 --> 28:23.302
He was married?

28:23.335 --> 28:24.303
With a kid.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.773
I just talked to his wife.
Tanner was broke.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.340
Credit cards
were maxed out.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.409
He spent all his money
on Lisa.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.244
Now he's begging his wife
to take him back.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.514
Maybe Lisa
didn't want him to go.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.216
Give me two minutes.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.752
Let's check out what else
Dr. Tanner forgot to tell us.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.922
[indistinct voices]

29:00.907 --> 29:02.241
No pulse.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.344
I told him.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.478
I told him!

29:06.512 --> 29:08.080
You think
Lisa's father did it?

29:09.315 --> 29:11.818
Who else?

29:20.426 --> 29:22.528
You promised you'd
stay away from Tanner.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.130
I didn't kill Tanner.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.365
You were
in his apartment.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.435
Your fingerprints
were on the doorknob.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.406
All right,
I followed him home.

29:34.440 --> 29:38.377
I had to find out
who hurt my baby.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.347
I went upstairs,
the door was open,

29:41.380 --> 29:42.882
I went inside.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.350
But he was already dead.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.888
Tim, listen to me.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.926
I know you've
been through a lot.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.230
Losing your daughter,
finding out she had HIV.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.432
I mean, my God.

30:03.235 --> 30:06.138
And if I'd found out

30:06.172 --> 30:09.208
she'd been with an older man
in some hotel...

30:10.977 --> 30:13.445
I'd have
shot the bastard too.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.417
What are you talking about?

30:20.887 --> 30:24.991
Are you saying
my little girl was a whore?

30:26.425 --> 30:29.461
Lisa was a good girl!

30:33.365 --> 30:35.467
He murdered her,
didn't he?

30:38.370 --> 30:40.973
I didn't shoot him.

30:43.609 --> 30:46.946
But I sure as hell
wish I did!

31:01.360 --> 31:02.361
Crime Scene searched
Downey's truck,

31:02.394 --> 31:04.363
his car, his house--
no gun.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.098
He could have
tossed it anywhere.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.900
They find anything
in Tanner's apartment?

31:07.934 --> 31:09.468
So far, the only prints
are from Tanner, Lisa,

31:09.501 --> 31:13.372
her father, and one
unidentified person.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.506
Tim Downey is still
our best bet.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.176
Captain,
Downey did not know

31:17.209 --> 31:19.011
Tanner had sex with Lisa
until I told him.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.312
I don't think
he's our guy.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.081
What'd you guys find?

31:22.114 --> 31:23.649
Nothing more
in Tanner's apartment.

31:23.682 --> 31:26.418
But we found this
in his locker at the hospital.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.520
Scarf from St. Tabitha's
high school.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.989
It's gotta be Lisa's.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.290
Well, then,
she has two,

31:31.323 --> 31:32.491
because I found one
exactly like that

31:32.524 --> 31:33.960
in her closet.

31:33.993 --> 31:37.029
There's a monogram on it.
"AA."

31:38.965 --> 31:41.333
As in Angela Agnelli.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.603
Locker number 503.
Right here.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.613
It's not exactly
your school uniform.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.016
Hey!
You can't go in there!

31:57.049 --> 31:58.985
School says we can.
Locker's their property.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.519
But that's my stuff!

32:00.552 --> 32:02.288
What's on the tape?

32:02.321 --> 32:03.589
I don't know.
It's Lisa's.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.591
She asked me
to hold it for her.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.560
Hmm. Why don't we
take a look at it?

32:17.369 --> 32:20.739
(Benson)
A little girl-on-girl
action.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.941
(Cragen)
There's our scarf.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.147
(Stabler)
And there's our Dr. Tanner.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.049
Whoa.
Hey, baby, I got somethin'
for ya!

32:30.082 --> 32:32.251
Did we contact
Angela's parents?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.152
They're in Europe.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.620
They gave us
permission to talk to her,

32:34.653 --> 32:36.488
but they didn't want
to interrupt their trip.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.756
That's nice.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.625
Tanner videotaped

32:39.658 --> 32:41.227
his own
little love train.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.728
That explains why

32:42.761 --> 32:44.130
he had Angela's scarf.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.665
She knew about Lisa and Tanner
the whole time.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.743
This is humiliating.

32:57.776 --> 33:00.312
Y-You didn't watch it,
did you?

33:00.346 --> 33:01.647
Uh, ahem...

33:01.680 --> 33:03.549
Yeah, we did.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.118
I didn't wanna do it,
but Lisa begged me.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.653
She said that she
needed cash,

33:07.686 --> 33:10.389
and Dr. Tanner was willing
to pay us a lot of money.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.423
How much?

33:11.457 --> 33:12.591
$500.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.493
Each.

33:14.526 --> 33:15.794
It's true.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.464
Angela, you have
lied to us about everything.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.566
We're trying
to catch the person

33:20.599 --> 33:22.268
who murdered
your best friend,

33:22.301 --> 33:24.103
and you just
keep lying.

33:24.136 --> 33:29.608
Because I didn't want you
to find out what I did.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.277
So what else
have you done?

33:31.310 --> 33:32.644
Nothing.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.081
I swear.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.549
What about Lisa?

33:42.321 --> 33:43.522
[sighs]

33:43.555 --> 33:47.126
She made
some other videos.

33:47.159 --> 33:50.162
A lot of other videos.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.631
She was doing hardcore?

33:56.168 --> 33:58.337
Yeah.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.106
She took me
to a porn store

34:00.139 --> 34:02.674
and showed me
all of her DVDs.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.077
She said I could
use the video

34:05.111 --> 34:06.612
as an audition tape,

34:06.645 --> 34:08.647
and I could
make a lot of money.

34:12.818 --> 34:16.455
I never wanted
to do it again.

34:16.488 --> 34:18.824
Who was Lisa
making movies for?

34:21.127 --> 34:24.230
Some guy named Max.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.768
(man)
Okay, Gina,
that's great, great.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.271
Now take him
over to the couch.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.473
That's it.

34:34.506 --> 34:37.343
Okay, move the camera.
Let's get the camera in.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.679
Max Long.
Shh.

34:41.747 --> 34:42.714
Police.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.216
Gaa! Cut!

34:44.250 --> 34:45.351
We're filming here.

34:45.384 --> 34:46.452
Not anymore.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.653
We're not doing
anything illegal.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.687
What the hell
is this about?

34:48.720 --> 34:49.788
Child porn.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.357
What, you think
I'm stupid?

34:51.390 --> 34:52.524
I don't make that stuff.

34:52.558 --> 34:53.592
Yeah, well,
then who's this?

34:53.625 --> 34:56.462
Trudi Strutz starring in
Trudi, Madly, Deeply.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.663
What are you
talking about?

34:57.696 --> 34:58.697
That's Allison.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.399
She's 19.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.401
No, that's Lisa.
She's 15.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.702
And she's dead.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.206
No, I checked
her driver's license.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.375
She's 19.
I have it on file.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.777
It was her cousin's.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.512
Well, you can't
bust me for this.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.381
It's an honest mistake.
This is child porn.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.615
Where were you
Monday night?

35:16.648 --> 35:18.484
Filming--
Wendy Does the White House.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.485
Where?

35:19.518 --> 35:21.820
An apartment on Eighth Avenue,
till 2:00 a.m.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.622
You think I killed her?

35:23.655 --> 35:26.525
That girl was like
a daughter to me.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.761
You get off watching
your daughter have sex?

35:29.795 --> 35:30.696
She wanted to do porn.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.364
You should be
talking to her boyfriend,

35:32.398 --> 35:33.432
not harassing me.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.466
Who's the boyfriend?

35:34.500 --> 35:35.467
Derek Tanner.

35:35.501 --> 35:36.668
Guy's obsessed with her.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.437
We've already spoken
with Dr. Tanner.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.471
He's a doctor?

35:39.505 --> 35:41.440
Was--treated Lisa
for HIV.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.841
She had HIV?

35:42.874 --> 35:44.343
Let's not pretend
you don't know.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.844
You think I'd be
filming if I did?

35:45.877 --> 35:47.646
I gotta shut down production,
call my actors.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.815
Get 'em all tested.
You gotta give me some time.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.885
Sleaze bag's
talking to his lawyer.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.387
All we've got him on

35:55.421 --> 35:56.755
is promoting the sexual
performance of a minor.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.290
He's gonna make bail
in five minutes.

35:58.324 --> 35:59.391
What about Long's alibi?

35:59.425 --> 36:00.826
Clears him
for Lisa's murder.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.928
Not for taking her
the final step into hell.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.397
How did this happen?

36:05.431 --> 36:07.366
Six months ago, she was
just another 15-year-old.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.601
Till she started hooking up
with half of Queens.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.836
After that,
it's no big deal

36:10.869 --> 36:12.804
to have sex
for designer clothes

36:12.838 --> 36:14.373
or prostitute yourself
in a hotel.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.942
And she ends up
as Trudi Strutz, porn star.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.477
She ends up
dead on a roof.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.911
(Fin)
You better take a look
at this.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.681
Hospital was investigating
Doc Tanner's billing.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.683
He gave a bunch of patients
fake names

36:24.716 --> 36:26.252
and social security numbers

36:26.285 --> 36:27.986
so nobody could trace
the tests he ran on them.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.488
HIV tests.
And STDs.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.324
Who was paying?
Company called Long Video.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.493
As in Max Long.

36:34.526 --> 36:38.497
Tanner was giving HIV tests
to Max Long's porn stars.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.466
Which means Max was lying.
He knew Lisa had HIV.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.767
Why would Tanner
risk his license

36:41.800 --> 36:42.701
to do the tests?

36:42.734 --> 36:44.470
Because Max Long
was blackmailing him.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.306
Max knew that he was
having sex with a 15-year-old.

36:47.339 --> 36:49.441
It still doesn't explain
who killed Lisa.

36:49.475 --> 36:50.509
Take a look at this.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.512
Max said his porn shoot
was at 695 Eighth Avenue.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.980
Lisa was found
at 590 Ninth.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.448
It sounds like
they're blocks apart.

36:56.482 --> 36:57.516
They're both
on 44th Street.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.850
They could
back onto each other.

36:58.884 --> 36:59.818
John, Fin, get up there.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.753
See if there's access
across the rooftops.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.455
Olivia, Elliot,
check with the crime lab,

37:03.489 --> 37:05.724
where they are
in forensics.

37:06.392 --> 37:07.559
About time.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.960
My client's been
extremely cooperative.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.530
Forensic metallurgists
found traces

37:11.563 --> 37:14.266
of brushed aluminum
in the wounds on Lisa's head.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.403
Just like
the tripods you use.

37:17.436 --> 37:18.604
Lots of things
are made of aluminum.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.406
That is true,
but the tripod head,

37:20.439 --> 37:23.275
like this one that we found
in your client's office,

37:23.309 --> 37:28.914
had Lisa's hair, skin,
and blood in the screw threads.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.582
So, Max...

37:30.616 --> 37:32.384
why'd you do it?

37:32.418 --> 37:34.353
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.487
You knew that Lisa

37:35.521 --> 37:36.655
was infected with HIV,

37:36.688 --> 37:38.390
and you let her go on
making porn.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.492
I told you I had no idea
she was positive.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.294
Saw the hospital records.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.763
Test results
were sent to you.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.465
Plus, your alibi
is not very good.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.467
To get from the porn shoot
on Eighth Avenue

37:48.500 --> 37:50.769
to the building where
Lisa was found on Ninth Avenue

37:50.802 --> 37:53.539
takes under three minutes.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.807
Adjoining roofs.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.676
That was clever.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.545
20 people will swear
Mr. Long was working

37:59.578 --> 38:01.012
at the time
of the girl's death.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.381
We'll see.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.350
Why don't you come
with me, Mr. Long?

38:05.917 --> 38:09.988
(Novak)
I'm sure you recognize the cast
of Wendy Does the White House.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.457
(Long)
What are they doing here?

38:11.490 --> 38:13.492
(Benson)
We thought
they'd want to know

38:13.525 --> 38:14.926
that you concealed
Lisa's HIV status from them.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.562
And I thought you were
the porn producer

38:16.595 --> 38:17.996
with a heart of gold, Max.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.432
All that stuff about
caring for your actors, that...

38:20.466 --> 38:22.468
really got to me.
I do care.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.838
Okay, I admit I made
a mistake with Lisa, but--

38:26.872 --> 38:28.507
Yeah, you did,
and they're pissed.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.308
You exposed them all
to HIV.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.111
I didn't want
to start a panic.

38:33.144 --> 38:33.979
No, you didn't want
to stop filming.

38:34.012 --> 38:36.047
I had a chance
to chat with your cast,

38:36.081 --> 38:37.683
and they had a lot
to talk about.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.784
Like how whenever
Lisa complained,

38:38.817 --> 38:40.386
you slapped her around
to shut her up.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.388
And how you left the set
for 20 minutes

38:42.421 --> 38:43.989
around 10 P.M.
the night Lisa died

38:44.022 --> 38:46.392
to shoot
some establishing shots.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.360
You even took your camera
and your tripod with you.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.495
You knew a child

38:49.528 --> 38:50.962
with HIV would ruin you.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.698
So you told her
to meet you up on that roof

38:52.731 --> 38:54.433
and you beat her brains in.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.934
Problem solved.
Fascinating.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.403
But it's all speculation.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.405
You think?

38:59.438 --> 39:00.872
A 15-year-old victim

39:00.906 --> 39:02.474
and a big,
ugly porn producer

39:02.508 --> 39:03.775
with motive, means,
and opportunity.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.445
I cannot wait to get this
in front of a jury.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.714
And once we get you
for Lisa's murder,

39:08.747 --> 39:10.015
then we'll get you
for Dr. Tanner's.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.083
I didn't kill...Tanner.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.120
We're gonna
prove that you did.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.488
You won't.

39:16.522 --> 39:17.923
Mr. Long was at a charity dinner
last night

39:17.956 --> 39:19.825
along with
several hundred people.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.527
There's a table
full of witnesses.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.528
Fine.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.062
Max Long,
you're under arrest

39:24.095 --> 39:25.564
for the murder
of Lisa Downey.

39:25.597 --> 39:26.998
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.601
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

39:29.635 --> 39:30.702
in a court of law.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.771
You have the right
to an attorney...

39:32.804 --> 39:34.706
Mr. Downey.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.875
They told me you got the guy
that killed Lisa.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.545
I wanted to say thanks.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.547
How are you doing?

39:41.580 --> 39:43.815
Ah, I'm getting there.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.820
I know how much
you loved Lisa.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.026
You look after yours, okay?

40:00.165 --> 40:02.601
(Cragen)
Elliot...

40:02.634 --> 40:04.436
Max Long
didn't kill Tanner.

40:04.470 --> 40:05.771
I know.
I checked his alibi.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.739
No, no, no.
We got more than that.

40:07.773 --> 40:08.974
The lab called.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.909
The mystery prints
in Tanner's apartment

40:10.942 --> 40:12.678
match the prints
on the videotape

40:12.711 --> 40:15.413
of Angela and Lisa.

40:20.552 --> 40:21.753
[school bell rings]

40:21.787 --> 40:22.988
[laughing]

40:23.021 --> 40:25.023
Bye. See ya.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.525
Hey, what's up?

40:26.558 --> 40:27.593
What's up?

40:27.626 --> 40:29.628
We found the man
who murdered Lisa.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.630
It was Max Long.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.599
Wow, so I guess
it's over.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.801
Well, he didn't
kill Dr. Tanner.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.203
Do you know who did?

40:38.236 --> 40:39.638
No. Why would I?

40:39.671 --> 40:41.540
This tape that we
got out of your locker.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.642
Lisa didn't ask you
to keep it for her.

40:43.675 --> 40:44.643
She did.

40:44.676 --> 40:47.178
For once,
don't lie to me.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.246
I swear.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.881
There's gunshot residue
on the tape.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.917
Your fingerprint
is in the residue.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.752
You went to Dr. Tanner's
apartment,

40:53.785 --> 40:55.521
you took
your father's gun.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.025
Why'd you shoot him?

41:08.800 --> 41:11.169
I asked him
to give me the tape.

41:14.740 --> 41:18.009
He said he couldn't,
because he would go to jail.

41:20.712 --> 41:23.181
All I kept thinking was...

41:23.214 --> 41:25.784
that somebody would see it.

41:25.817 --> 41:29.054
And my life would be ruined.

41:31.923 --> 41:35.594
I pointed the gun
at him and...

41:35.627 --> 41:37.729
He grabbed it.

41:39.565 --> 41:42.701
And it went off.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.743
I'm sorry!

41:53.011 --> 41:55.581
I'm so sorry.

41:55.614 --> 41:58.750
I just wanted
my life back!

41:58.784 --> 42:01.286
[sobbing]

42:03.789 --> 42:05.757
Shh. Shh.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.270
