00:09.976 --> 00:12.811
<i>[Amy] Something was left
for dead,</i>

00:12.813 --> 00:14.847
<i>but then it came back.</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:16.815
<i>They're feeling the anger</i>

00:16.817 --> 00:19.451
that's associated
with his thing.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.854
Something has a hold
of him. Definitely.

00:21.856 --> 00:25.624
I think it either wants me to
harm or maybe even kill someone.

00:25.626 --> 00:29.161
Physically shaking them,
trying to wake them up.

00:30.864 --> 00:35.067
There were five murder-suicides
very near your client's property.

00:35.069 --> 00:41.340
All she's being driven, uh,
by now is revenge and rage.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.208
I knew it was me.

00:44.177 --> 00:45.744
<i>[Amy] I don't like it in here.</i>

00:45.746 --> 00:48.013
<i>Like, this is the worst place.</i>

00:49.783 --> 00:51.150
It wants the person dead.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.152
My name is Amy Allan.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.686
I see dead people.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.656
I saw a winged creature.

00:57.658 --> 01:01.627
I speak to dead people
and they speak to me.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.829
This person feels
like a monster.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.999
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:07.001 --> 01:10.936
They are sucking the life
out of these people.

01:10.938 --> 01:11.904
I rely on my partner.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.772
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.741
I'm a retired New York City
Homicide Detective.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.209
So, how many bodies
are we talking about?

01:17.211 --> 01:21.447
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.948
It's my job to reveal them.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.017
But Steve and I never speak.

01:25.019 --> 01:26.919
We never communicate during
an investigation.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.654
Until the very end.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.689
- [gasps]
- You're not gonna like this.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.758
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.060
I'm sorry. I need to take
a break.

01:35.462 --> 01:36.995
Or time to get out.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.831
It wants inside the house
because it wants to kill you.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.365
[gasps]

01:52.479 --> 01:54.680
<i>[Steve] So, I'm out here in the
tiny town of Graham, Washington.</i>

01:54.682 --> 01:56.281
<i>It's just south of Tacoma.</i>

01:56.283 --> 01:58.750
<i>I got an emotional call
from a woman named Brandy.</i>

01:58.752 --> 02:03.655
<i>Now, she's convinced whatever's in
her house has possessed her fiance.</i>

02:03.657 --> 02:07.659
<i>She told me if Amy and I don't get there
soon, it's gonna rip her family apart.</i>

02:07.661 --> 02:09.361
<i>Hopefully, we're not too late.</i>

02:16.669 --> 02:19.271
<i>I don't really feel good
about this.</i>

02:20.206 --> 02:24.042
<i>There's a lot of negative
energy being sent my way</i>

02:24.044 --> 02:25.978
<i>and, like, blocking...</i>

02:25.980 --> 02:28.080
I just feet blocked.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.350
[Matthew] What's blocking you?

02:31.352 --> 02:34.987
I believe it's
a living female...

02:34.989 --> 02:39.124
who doesn't necessarily
want me here.

02:39.126 --> 02:42.161
They're more than
likely telepathic.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.702
<i>[Steve] So, Brandy, I got to
tell you, pulling up to your house,</i>

02:50.704 --> 02:53.772
<i>this is a quaint home
you have here.</i>

02:53.774 --> 02:56.208
But it sounds like, when
we spoke on the phone,

02:56.210 --> 02:57.876
that you're just at the end
of your rope here.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.077
I am.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.747
There's something attacking
my family.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.016
I need to find out what it is.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.251
All right. So, Brandy, who
exactly lives in the house here?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.820
My son Trevor. He's 29.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.856
- [Steve] Trevor's here in the black?
- [Brandy] Yes.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.524
[Brandy] My fiance, Mark.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.092
And myself.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.461
Tell me about the experiences
you guys are having.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.264
<i>[Brandy] We experience
mood changes.</i>

03:19.832 --> 03:21.600
<i>We see shadow figures.</i>

03:21.602 --> 03:24.203
<i>And now,
it's physically violent.</i>

03:24.205 --> 03:27.172
[Steve] Let's start with the mood
changes. Who's getting affected?

03:27.174 --> 03:29.074
[Brandy] Mark usually gets
the deepest.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.409
It's more of a--

03:30.411 --> 03:33.579
<i>It's so dark.
It's like a rage.</i>

03:33.581 --> 03:37.749
You made a bold statement to me and you
said, you know, you think he's possessed.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.152
I think he-- Something has
a hold of him. Definitely.

03:40.154 --> 03:42.854
He changes. He goes dark.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.423
Like, his eyes change.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.059
He's a different person.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.927
[Steve] And what about Trevor?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.896
<i>[Brandy] He isolates himself.</i>

03:50.898 --> 03:53.398
What about you
as far as mood changes?

03:53.400 --> 03:56.868
I get sadness, fits of sadness
that come through at me,

03:56.870 --> 03:59.938
- [Steve] Okay.
- Extremely powerful.

03:59.940 --> 04:03.842
What do you think the
intentions are? Of whatever it is.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.777
It's trying to make us
hurt each other.

04:05.779 --> 04:06.979
- Okay.
- [Brandy] I really believe that.

04:06.981 --> 04:09.948
I believe that it's taking
the energy out of us

04:09.950 --> 04:13.919
and all its leaving
is aggression and anger.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.089
- That's kind of, scary.
- It's terrifying.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.890
And it's hard to keep
the family together

04:18.892 --> 04:20.993
with it being like that.

04:23.896 --> 04:27.366
I am feeling, like,
a lot of pain in my stomach.

04:27.368 --> 04:32.938
<i>Living people here are feeling
unusual amounts of anger.</i>

04:32.940 --> 04:38.510
And, like, people who are more
sensitive get the rock of hatred,

04:38.512 --> 04:40.812
that almost makes
you want to vomit.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.982
[Matthew] Does it make them prone
to any kind of, action more or anything?

04:43.984 --> 04:48.453
It is a pretty intense anger.
Uh...

04:48.455 --> 04:51.423
So it is a possibility that
they may act out on it,

04:51.425 --> 04:53.692
depending on the individual.

04:53.694 --> 04:57.296
I'm still trying to figure out where
all this anger is coming from.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.674
<i>[Brandy] This is where most
of the activity happens for me.</i>

05:08.676 --> 05:11.777
Okay, so, tell me about some
of the stuff that's happening.

05:11.779 --> 05:18.483
There's an entity in here that
sits on my legs almost every night.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.851
[Steve] So, are you asleep
when this happens?

05:19.853 --> 05:21.953
Sometimes.
Sometimes I'm awake.

05:21.955 --> 05:25.223
Sometimes I can look down
and watch it happen on my legs.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.892
Okay. Anything else?

05:26.894 --> 05:31.863
Well, when I'm asleep something
will shove me and wake me up.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.366
- So, it feels like a hand.
- Yeah, it does.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.001
Feels like a very strong hand.

05:36.003 --> 05:40.972
All right. So, do me a favor. Show
on me, how you're getting shoved.

05:41.607 --> 05:44.042
- All right. So--
- Enough to wake you up.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.111
- Yeah. So, it's a little bit annoying...
- Yes.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.146
- [Steve] ...to say the least.
- It startles you.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.314
Okay.

05:50.116 --> 05:53.985
<i>[Amy] I'm seeing,
like, a little old lady.</i>

05:54.620 --> 05:59.491
She's probably, like, late 70s.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.227
And she's like,
"Why are you in my house?"

06:06.833 --> 06:08.700
She's a little confused.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.801
[Matthew] What do you mean?

06:09.803 --> 06:13.004
[Amy] She doesn't know
that she's, you know, dead.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.974
<i>She's extremely stressed
about it.</i>

06:15.976 --> 06:18.176
She's trying to wake people up.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.178
- [Matthew] So it's the living she's trying to wake up?
- Yeah.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.980
<i>[Amy] This is bad.</i>

06:24.917 --> 06:26.017
<i>[Steve] All right. What else?</i>

06:26.019 --> 06:30.756
Several times I've woken up
to a huge shadow figure

06:30.758 --> 06:35.527
walking around the side of the bed
or hovering over the Mark at night.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.829
So does this have human form?

06:37.831 --> 06:42.234
The top of it is shaped, um, kind
of, like the shape of a... a head...

06:42.568 --> 06:44.669
- and shoulders.
- Okay.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.639
Actually, Mark asked me
to draw for him what I saw

06:47.641 --> 06:50.208
and I have a sketch that I did.

06:54.814 --> 06:57.015
- [Steve] So, this is you and Mark.
- [Brandy] Yes.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.683
- [Steve] And this is entity here.
- [Brandy] Yes.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.852
[Steve] Who do you think
that is?

07:00.854 --> 07:05.457
I think it's evil. I think it's
been here for a long time.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.126
- Do you think that's what's taken over him?
- [Brandy] I do.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.061
- Okay.
- I do. I think it's influencing him

07:10.063 --> 07:11.997
in a horrible way.

07:11.999 --> 07:16.468
I'm afraid to even ask you if there's
anything else going on here. But, what else?

07:16.470 --> 07:19.671
I've been waking up
with painful scratches.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.874
- Okay.
- On my neck, on my arm, my chest.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.410
I have a couple of pictures
if you want to see them.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.482
This one here is of the one
on my chest.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.684
And that one is on the side
of my arm.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.986
- [Steve] Could the cat be jumping up on the bed?
- [Brandy] No.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.889
They're definitely
not, like, cat scratches.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.824
Are you allergic to anything?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.926
- No.
- [Steve] Okay.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.028
You've got a lot going on
here. Is there anything else?

07:43.030 --> 07:44.062
I get bad nightmares.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.831
Any that you can remember?

07:45.833 --> 07:50.202
One night, I had a--
It's a flash of Mark

07:50.204 --> 07:51.770
up against the wall

07:51.772 --> 07:53.972
with a gunshot to his head.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.774
This is a dream you're having?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.709
Yeah. They felt like warnings.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.778
- [Brandy] I don't like it.
- Right.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.781
I don't want it to hurt my
family, I want my family back

08:02.783 --> 08:04.749
- and I want it to stop.
- Okay.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.018
Because we worked really
hard to get here.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.254
- [Steve] Yeah.
- Took a lot of love.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.060
<i>[Amy] This old woman,</i>

08:15.062 --> 08:17.929
like, they're physically
feeling her,

08:17.931 --> 08:20.499
uh, shaking them, shaking them.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.968
Trying to wake them up.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.171
<i>She is running around and
physically interacting with the living.</i>

08:26.839 --> 08:28.874
<i>Pushing on them, shaking them.</i>

08:28.876 --> 08:32.310
There's a sense of urgency
and panic.

08:32.945 --> 08:39.084
<i>I'm getting a lot of very
vivid nightmares.</i>

08:40.586 --> 08:43.021
It's a possibility that
they might be having

08:43.023 --> 08:46.157
some kind of dream
about this elderly woman

08:46.159 --> 08:48.260
or whatever the [bleep]
she went through.

08:49.795 --> 08:51.463
Terrible, terrible.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.123
<i>[Steve] So, Mark, I was talking
to Brandy today, your fiance,</i>

09:18.125 --> 09:21.993
and she was explaining how
the paranormal in the house here

09:22.061 --> 09:23.662
is attacking everybody.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.931
- You agree with that?
- Yes, I do, I actually.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.768
Brandy also told me that, um,
whatever's here in the house

09:29.770 --> 09:33.171
seems to be attached to you
or influencing you.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.072
You agree with that?

09:34.074 --> 09:37.208
Yeah, it's definitely
affecting my mood.

09:37.210 --> 09:41.613
I think it either wants me to
harm or maybe even kill someone.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.948
[Steve] Okay.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.750
What experiences have you had,
though, that you can talk about?

09:45.752 --> 09:49.955
When I'm here,
I'm drained of energy.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.090
- Uh, I get confused.
- Okay.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.892
[Mark] And I get depressed.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.694
When I'm away from here,
I'm great.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.896
All right. So anything
else happening?

09:57.898 --> 10:00.765
Yes. Lately, I've been waking up
with strange scratches on my body.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.434
Here, to show you.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.572
<i>[Steve] Brandy showed me some
pictures of scratches, too.</i>

10:07.574 --> 10:10.809
[Mark] This one was of my leg.

10:10.811 --> 10:14.112
It was on the front of my thigh and
I can't explain where it came from.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.714
[Steve] Okay.
And what's this one?

10:15.716 --> 10:18.350
[Mark] This one was
on my back, on my shoulder.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.018
[Steve] You're not allergic
to anything?

10:20.020 --> 10:22.153
No. I get hay fever but--

10:22.155 --> 10:23.922
- [Steve] Nothing that will cause this.
- No.

10:23.924 --> 10:24.823
[Mark] No.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.358
What else?

10:26.360 --> 10:29.794
Brandy says that
I've been sleepwalking,

10:29.796 --> 10:31.763
which I've never been
a sleepwalker.

10:31.765 --> 10:38.703
She says that I have... nightmares to where
I'm curled up in a defensive position,

10:38.705 --> 10:42.807
um, yelling out,
"No! Get away from me!"

10:42.809 --> 10:45.543
Are you taking any sleeping medications
that might cause you to do that?

10:45.545 --> 10:48.446
- No, I don't take any medications at all.
- [Steve] Okay.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.982
What are you hoping
we can do for you guys?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.852
Hopefully, you can give us some
answers on how to fight this thing,

10:53.854 --> 10:56.721
so that we can be happy
and live our lives.

10:56.723 --> 10:59.090
So I can have my family.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.925
It's upsetting to you.
I can see that.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.228
- Very much so.
- [Steve] Yeah.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.266
[sighs heavily]

11:13.939 --> 11:15.573
- [Mark] Sorry.
- [Steve] No. Don't be sorry.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.208
[Steve] Listen...

11:17.210 --> 11:20.578
It's more than reasonable
for you to be upset about it.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.814
I appreciate it.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.449
If Amy says, you got to get
the hell out of here.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.018
Would you go?

11:28.254 --> 11:31.289
If it's going to be what's best for
my family, I'll figure something out.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.158
Okay.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.028
<i>[Amy] Big guy, big guy.</i>

11:37.630 --> 11:39.464
<i>Just seeing like, a big guy</i>

11:39.466 --> 11:43.201
<i>drinking alcohol and feeling
very angry.</i>

11:44.236 --> 11:45.470
Hmm.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.939
I feel like he's alive.

11:47.941 --> 11:52.444
So I think that the living in here
would feel an insane amount of anger

11:52.446 --> 11:54.145
and then nausea.

11:57.683 --> 12:00.618
What is making the living
so angry here?

12:00.620 --> 12:04.189
I'm seeing something
in the ground coming out?

12:09.995 --> 12:13.164
Somebody's saying "death"
and somebody's saying "suicide."

12:13.566 --> 12:15.834
And then, I am seeing a gun.

12:15.836 --> 12:20.004
I don't like it in here.
Like, this is the worst place.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.280
<i>[Steve] So, Trevor,
I was talking to mom today,</i>

12:29.282 --> 12:34.052
and she was telling me that she feels
the paranormal activity in this house

12:35.020 --> 12:37.489
Is so bad that
somebody's gonna get hurt.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.424
I mean, do you agree
with that at all?

12:39.426 --> 12:42.861
Yes. I feel like it's just
been getting worse and worse.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.764
Do me a favor and tell me about
some of the experiences that you've had.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.233
So, the first time we came
in to see the house,

12:48.235 --> 12:50.468
I had this overwhelming
feeling of just being watched.

12:50.669 --> 12:52.003
Okay.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.206
And being compelled to not go
into certain areas of the house.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.109
Do you feel that way more in
certain spots? Or was it all over?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.878
It's in certain spots.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.945
Which spots
are we talking about?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.080
The spare-room.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.582
- This one here, behind me. Okay.
- Yeah.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.151
<i>[Trevor] And also,
on the outside</i>

13:06.153 --> 13:08.153
<i>there's the the back left
corner of the yard.</i>

13:08.155 --> 13:12.557
<i>For some reason I just don't have
any want or desire to go over there.</i>

13:12.559 --> 13:14.692
[Steve] Okay. Anything else?

13:14.694 --> 13:18.963
I've also seen a giant black figure
staring at me from the spare room here.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.065
- [Steve] Over here?
- [Trevor] Yes.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.669
[Trevor] It was about seven
or eight feet tall.

13:24.671 --> 13:28.306
Okay. There's any way that shadow
could have came from outside?

13:28.308 --> 13:31.476
No way. It was darker
than the darkness of night.

13:31.478 --> 13:36.347
Your mom thinks that whatever's in
this house is trying to possess Mark.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.818
- [Steve] Do you see that?
- I definitely see an influence on him.

13:39.820 --> 13:43.188
[Trevor] He hasn't become violent
with us but it's that type of rage.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.190
- [Steve] So, it's scary.
- Yes.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.761
[Amy] What the [bleep]?

13:49.763 --> 13:52.964
Something out there
back left corner.

13:56.135 --> 13:59.470
What is that?
It just felt blocked.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.939
What the [bleep] is going on?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.308
Like, left for dead.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.513
Something in the back
left corner like, left for dead.

14:08.515 --> 14:12.116
So, it's dead and then buried
but then it came back.

14:18.157 --> 14:21.893
I'm seeing a human form
doing that, not an animal.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.996
It feels animal.

14:24.998 --> 14:30.034
I-- I believe it was a person
who just, kind of,

14:30.536 --> 14:33.004
is now functioning
like an animal.

14:33.006 --> 14:36.407
I think this dead person is
causing all of the anger here.

14:38.544 --> 14:42.146
Everybody, I feel on some level

14:42.148 --> 14:46.584
are feeling the anger that's
associated with this thing.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.287
Angry. Very, very angry.

15:02.601 --> 15:04.235
<i>[Steve] I made my usual calls
when I got to town</i>

15:04.237 --> 15:06.771
<i>and just heard back from
a local genealogist.</i>

15:06.773 --> 15:12.377
<i>She tells me a previous owner of Brandy's
land dropped dead, right on the property.</i>

15:12.379 --> 15:14.646
<i>She says this guy lived
such an interesting life,</i>

15:14.648 --> 15:17.015
<i>I'm definitely going to want
to hear about it.</i>

15:23.989 --> 15:26.190
<i>So, Mary, I appreciate you
helping me out with this case.</i>

15:26.192 --> 15:29.127
This guy who died on my
client's property. Who was he?

15:29.129 --> 15:30.628
His name was Arnold Reuther.

15:30.630 --> 15:35.033
He was born in 1919
in North Dakota.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.036
[Steve] So, on the phone you mentioned
that this guy had an interesting story,

15:38.038 --> 15:39.037
what did you find out?

15:39.039 --> 15:41.673
He left home at about age 16.

15:41.675 --> 15:44.475
He went to Seattle in 1943.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.779
And he met a woman there,
Frances Manzer.

15:47.781 --> 15:51.015
Whirlwind romance, they married
about three months after they met.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.117
This is right in the middle
of World War II.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.853
Right. As many men
of his generation did,

15:55.855 --> 15:59.924
he joined up World War II just
six months after they were married.

15:59.926 --> 16:04.896
He enlisted in the Navy and he
worked on a tank landing ship.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.731
Okay. So, he definitely
saw action.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.734
Yeah. His ship was stationed
in the South Pacific

16:09.736 --> 16:13.171
and I'm sure he saw
the horrors of war.

16:15.841 --> 16:19.243
I am seeing some
kind of cemetery.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.113
<i>Very strange.</i>

16:22.915 --> 16:28.186
I counted about
15 or 16 headstones

16:28.188 --> 16:32.190
and I was told that they're
unmarked graves.

16:35.928 --> 16:39.697
I see a man. He is dressed

16:39.699 --> 16:44.635
in, like, this weird
military outfit.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.271
I think the graves has
something to do with him.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.675
<i>[Steve] All right. So, Mary,
he's in the war.</i>

16:50.677 --> 16:52.076
When does he return
to stateside?

16:52.811 --> 16:57.482
He was discharged in 1946
and came back to this area.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.684
When did she buy
my client's property?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.020
He and Frances lived in a house

17:02.022 --> 17:05.289
- right next door to your client's property.
- Okay.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.826
In '1975, he was looking
to expand his land.

17:08.828 --> 17:14.265
He wanted to farm. And so, they
brought the property to raise livestock.

17:14.267 --> 17:19.037
So, Mary, I know Arnold died while
he was living on my client's property.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.271
What happened?

17:20.273 --> 17:23.441
- In October 1994, Arnold had a massive heart attack.
- Oh.

17:23.443 --> 17:27.712
[Mary] And Frances frantically
called for an ambulance to come.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.849
But they were late, and by
the time he got to the hospital,

17:31.851 --> 17:32.850
he was dead on arrival.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.685
My father died of a massive
heart attack.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.555
- I can guarantee he died before he hit the ground.
- Right.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.891
What a shame. Especially
for Frances to see that.

17:39.893 --> 17:43.094
I think it was really hard,
feeling so helpless.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.798
All right. So,
Frances is left, now, a widow.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.499
What happened after that?

17:48.501 --> 17:50.835
She stayed on the property
for a couple years.

17:50.837 --> 17:56.474
In 1996, she had your client's
house built on the property.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.743
-Okay. So, she built my
client's house -[Mary] Right.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.012
I don't know whether
she lived there or not,

18:01.580 --> 18:04.382
but, either the property
was too much

18:04.384 --> 18:07.685
or the memories were too much
for her to stay there.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.121
So, she sold the property
in 1997.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.891
She moved a few miles away
and she died in 2008.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.127
She was 84 years old.

18:16.129 --> 18:19.730
[Steve] Okay. So, 84, she
probably died of natural causes.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.898
Do we know
if she ever remarried?

18:20.900 --> 18:23.134
- No, she did not.
- Okay.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.371
<i>[Amy] I'm seeing that little
old lady again.</i>

18:28.974 --> 18:33.144
<i>She's, like, freaking out about
like, a truck that's driving up.</i>

18:33.879 --> 18:35.580
There's panic about this truck.

18:35.582 --> 18:39.050
She's saying 1996.

18:39.985 --> 18:45.056
<i>The house, though, looks really,
really different through her eyes.</i>

18:45.958 --> 18:49.327
I'm gonna say
that she did live here.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.562
But it's really,
really different.

18:51.564 --> 18:56.000
[exhales heavily]
Her mind is very...

18:57.236 --> 18:59.670
<i>[Steve] I reached out to my
old friend, author Jeff Davis.</i>

18:59.672 --> 19:01.873
<i>He tells me he can't explain it,</i>

19:01.875 --> 19:03.641
<i>but there have been a series
of murder-suicides</i>

19:03.643 --> 19:05.843
<i>in Brandy
and Mark's neighborhood.</i>

19:05.845 --> 19:10.414
<i>He tells me one of them really stands
out and might help my investigation.</i>

19:16.822 --> 19:18.789
[Steve] Jeff, I appreciate
you helping me out once again.

19:18.791 --> 19:19.624
It's good to see you.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.424
[Jeff] Good to see you too.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.461
All right.
So, what'd you find out?

19:23.463 --> 19:29.233
I am sad to say that in a
10-year period from 2009 to 2019,

19:29.235 --> 19:33.171
there were five murder-suicides
very near your client's property.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.672
That's a lot.

19:34.739 --> 19:36.807
I mean, I've worked on my
fair share of murder-suicides

19:36.809 --> 19:39.777
- but that's in a big city.
- Yeah. Yeah. Not expected.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.914
[Steve] You said one case
really stood out. Tell me about it.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.983
I've got a case that involves
an entire family this time.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.320
Sometime after midnight,
March 13th, 2018,

19:49.322 --> 19:53.558
-an Air Force airman named
Clinton Field called 911, -Okay.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.862
And he reported that he'd just
killed his 33-year-old wife, Samantha,

19:57.864 --> 20:01.699
his four-year-old daughter, Ava,
and his two-year-old son, Ashen.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.801
Oh, jeez.
Did he say anything else?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.670
Yeah. He almost made
an apology.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.606
He thanked the police
for their courtesy.

20:08.608 --> 20:12.977
But he also said, "By the time
you get here, I'll be dead too."

20:12.979 --> 20:15.746
He hung up the phone and
by the time the cops arrived,

20:15.748 --> 20:17.481
he was dead, he shot himself.

20:17.483 --> 20:20.585
All right. That's pretty
vicious murder-suicide.

20:20.587 --> 20:24.655
All right. So, do we have any
idea why this maniac did this?

20:24.657 --> 20:29.760
According to investigators, it may have
had to do with, uh, impending divorce.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.996
Uh, and he may have been
suffering from depression as well.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.465
[Steve] You know,
murder-suicides happen all the time

20:34.467 --> 20:36.434
but when you involve kids
it's sickening.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.470
Hmm.

20:40.672 --> 20:43.374
Like, hearing a [bleep]
woman screaming.

20:44.943 --> 20:48.446
Like, oh God, like, she's,
like, dying, it's like a moment--

20:48.680 --> 20:49.981
Like, dying.

20:51.783 --> 20:56.954
I am hearing somebody
talking about a death.

20:59.124 --> 21:02.260
<i>Somebody mentioning suicide?</i>

21:03.729 --> 21:04.962
This was a suicide.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.465
She was, like, screaming.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.300
What the [bleep] is going on?

21:09.968 --> 21:12.069
"Oh, God! Help me!"

21:40.866 --> 21:42.600
<i>[Steve] So far, I've got a client
convinced something in her house</i>

21:42.602 --> 21:44.168
<i>is possessing her fiance</i>

21:44.170 --> 21:48.739
<i>on a property near the site of
several different murder-suicides.</i>

21:48.741 --> 21:50.975
<i>But I want to see
if there's anything else.</i>

21:52.411 --> 21:53.711
<i>Searching through the archives,</i>

21:53.713 --> 21:56.247
<i>I find something very
interesting about an army base,</i>

21:56.249 --> 21:58.983
<i>that's about a mile away
from Brandy's house.</i>

21:58.985 --> 22:02.720
<i>Turns out, one of the training fields
there has been used as a dumping ground</i>

22:02.722 --> 22:05.056
<i>for dozens of murder victims.</i>

22:05.824 --> 22:08.392
<i>A military base seems
like a real strange place</i>

22:08.394 --> 22:10.928
<i>for people to dumping
dead bodies.</i>

22:10.930 --> 22:13.397
<i>So I reached out to a local
journalist who covered this story.</i>

22:13.399 --> 22:16.534
<i>And he says the location
is very remote.</i>

22:16.536 --> 22:20.271
<i>He also says, there's one case in
particular, I definitely got to know about.</i>

22:27.546 --> 22:30.881
So, the with spot all the dead
bodies, where exactly is it?

22:30.883 --> 22:33.651
[Dunkelberger] It's a training
area known as Fort Lewis.

22:33.653 --> 22:37.788
That area is known for being a dumping
ground for countless murder victims.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.890
We've got areas
like that in New York,

22:39.892 --> 22:43.694
nobody's around, bad guys know it
and that's where they dump dead bodies.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.896
You mentioned on the phone,
with all those bodies

22:45.898 --> 22:47.798
you found a specific one
I'd be interested in.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.134
Um, who's the victim?

22:50.136 --> 22:53.904
The victim was 17-year-old
Noreen McNicholas.

22:53.906 --> 22:54.839
[Steve] Okay.

22:54.841 --> 23:00.745
And disappeared
in November 5th, 1948.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.413
All right. So, what happens
after that?

23:02.415 --> 23:04.448
A month into the investigation,

23:04.450 --> 23:09.687
a boy's dog catches the scent and
starts digging around a marshy area.

23:09.689 --> 23:13.491
Hidden underneath the marshy
area was Noreen's nude body.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.761
Did the autopsy show
how she died?

23:16.763 --> 23:21.599
The coroner report said that she was
badly beaten and strangled to death.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.800
Did they like anybody
for this homicide?

23:22.802 --> 23:26.604
The case went fairly cold
for several years

23:26.606 --> 23:29.874
and then we had another break
and that's when it gets weird.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.009
So, how does the other break
come about?

23:32.011 --> 23:34.945
It was a strange situation
where two enlisted servicemen

23:34.947 --> 23:36.947
took their dates
to the same park.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.817
One of the girls
was 18-year-old Ella Cooper...

23:39.819 --> 23:41.585
- [Steve] Okay.
- who immediately started

23:41.587 --> 23:45.956
ranting and collapsing and
yelling, "Noreen, lookout."

23:45.958 --> 23:50.161
Her erratic behavior drew
the attention of a police officer.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.328
So, is she having a flashback?

23:51.330 --> 23:53.464
That's the theory.

23:53.466 --> 23:57.268
When she finally calmed down, she admitted
to being at the scene of the murder.

23:58.336 --> 23:59.870
[Steve] All right. So what
else did she give up?

23:59.872 --> 24:05.142
She confessed that she had gone
to the park with Noreen and two men,

24:05.144 --> 24:08.045
and one of them was named
Bill Smith

24:08.047 --> 24:10.448
and the other one she only
knew as Bob.

24:11.082 --> 24:13.818
Bill Smith and Bob. Okay.

24:13.820 --> 24:18.088
Ella said that Bill Smith
got jealous

24:18.090 --> 24:21.992
about Noreen wanting to
possibly date Bob or just not him.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.661
So, he ended up killing her.

24:23.663 --> 24:28.666
All right. So, why did it take this girl
three years to give up what happened?

24:28.668 --> 24:32.470
Ella told police that Bill
Smith threatened to kill her

24:32.472 --> 24:34.271
if she ever talked
about anything.

24:34.273 --> 24:38.375
And so she trained herself to
simply forget that it ever happened.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.478
That, all those emotions
came back

24:40.480 --> 24:43.414
when she visited the same park
where Noreen died.

24:43.416 --> 24:46.784
It took two trials but he was
sentenced to life in prison.

24:46.786 --> 24:50.421
Okay. What about this guy Bob?
He's obviously an accomplice.

24:51.756 --> 24:55.192
[Dunkelberger] Ella gave a
description of Bob to the police.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.727
- [Steve] Okay.
- [Dunkelberger] There were 150 leads,

24:56.729 --> 24:58.863
but they never found Bob.

24:58.865 --> 25:02.967
Well, at least in this case the body
was found and there was closure to it.

25:02.969 --> 25:06.136
I can only imagine how many bodies
are out there that have no closure.

25:09.140 --> 25:13.410
<i>I'm seeing that dead person
who's causing all of the anger here.</i>

25:13.778 --> 25:16.347
It is a female,

25:17.182 --> 25:21.952
who was crawling on her hands
and knees,

25:21.954 --> 25:23.654
kind of, crawling towards me

25:23.656 --> 25:29.226
and she was in a very
decomposed state.

25:32.564 --> 25:37.735
I could see, as well,
longer straight brown hair,

25:37.737 --> 25:44.008
and I believe that
she's relatively young.

25:44.809 --> 25:48.512
I hear 150. I don't know
what that means, though.

25:48.514 --> 25:51.949
I keep hearing like, "Bobby."

25:51.951 --> 25:56.353
I would assume that it has
something to do with being buried alive.

26:00.959 --> 26:04.228
Now that she's dead, she's
morphing into this animal

26:04.230 --> 26:06.730
and it's just full of rage.

26:06.732 --> 26:11.969
So I'm thinking as far as,
whatever this is,

26:11.971 --> 26:16.674
was not happy about being
buried there

26:16.676 --> 26:20.945
and seeking revenge.

26:20.947 --> 26:28.947
I think that that's the only thing,
uh, that this thing feels or thinks.

26:28.988 --> 26:34.024
There's no, like, higher thinking
processes going on anymore.

26:34.026 --> 26:39.730
It's just an-- Like, this
drive, an animalistic drive

26:39.732 --> 26:42.333
which is just anger-motivated.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.675
<i>I saw a lot of disturbing
things on my walk,</i>

26:51.677 --> 26:53.978
<i>but two concerned me the most.</i>

26:53.980 --> 26:58.349
First, the animal-like dead girl
crawling out of the shallow grave.

26:59.451 --> 27:03.420
I want to show like,
her front part as thin.

27:03.422 --> 27:07.091
So, slight built, naked, dirty.

27:07.559 --> 27:12.496
Her hair, it's wet and kind
of, mucked up with mud.

27:12.498 --> 27:18.736
Next, I described a scene where the old
dead woman is waking up a living person.

27:18.738 --> 27:24.942
I want it, so that, the person's in
the bed and she's holding their arm.

27:24.944 --> 27:29.013
What she does,
is shake them awake that way.

27:29.948 --> 27:33.217
So, she has barrettes
in her hair.

27:40.058 --> 27:42.059
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:43.328 --> 27:45.295
Yes, that's what I saw.

28:04.916 --> 28:08.052
<i>[Steve] Now that Amy and I
have completed our investigations,</i>

28:08.054 --> 28:10.721
<i>we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other</i>

28:10.723 --> 28:12.923
<i>and our clients
for the first time.</i>

28:12.925 --> 28:15.826
So guys, I want you to meet Amy.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.661
She's going to be doing
the reveal from another room

28:17.663 --> 28:19.963
so she can concentrate
on your case

28:19.965 --> 28:21.899
and the dead without
any distractions.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.601
Amy, meet Brandy
and her fiance, Mark.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.704
They live in the home
with their son, Trevor

28:26.706 --> 28:30.974
and this is him right here
who's, uh, 29-years-old.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.744
Obviously, we're not there in
the home, we're in a local library,

28:33.746 --> 28:36.780
uh, we'll get into why later.

28:36.782 --> 28:40.818
But, you should know that whatever's
in the house is ripping this family apart.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.153
And, if we can't find
a solution,

28:43.155 --> 28:45.322
you guys really don't think
you're gonna make it. Do you?

28:45.490 --> 28:46.723
Yeah.

28:46.791 --> 28:49.727
So, that being said, Amy may
have some questions for you,

28:49.729 --> 28:52.029
if not, she'll tell us about
her walk.

28:53.798 --> 28:55.833
[Amy] When I first arrived,

28:55.835 --> 29:01.839
I absolutely felt a lot
of negative energy.

29:01.841 --> 29:06.076
I initially felt blocked by a
living person, who's a telepath.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.078
That would be you.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.481
After that, I go into the house,

29:10.483 --> 29:12.783
and when I walked
into the kitchen,

29:12.785 --> 29:17.488
I encountered an elderly woman.

29:17.490 --> 29:24.027
I also encountered her in
the back bedroom to the right.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.863
That's Trevor's room.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.798
And then in the main bedroom.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.768
<i>I saw her kind of,
running around.</i>

29:30.770 --> 29:36.173
She was in both rooms trying
to shake you guys awake,

29:37.976 --> 29:44.448
I was getting that there
were consistent nightmares,

29:44.450 --> 29:45.983
uh, being had.

29:46.351 --> 29:48.085
This explained so much.

29:48.087 --> 29:54.024
Brandy tells me that I will
actually physically get out of bed,

29:54.026 --> 29:56.527
and then come back
and get in bed,

29:56.529 --> 29:58.729
and I have
no recollection of it.

29:58.731 --> 30:00.597
Brandy, you keep getting
woken up at night, though, right?

30:00.599 --> 30:02.733
- [Brandy] Yeah. Many times.
- Yeah.

30:02.735 --> 30:05.803
I know sometimes when I wake up
well a lot of the times when I wake up,

30:05.805 --> 30:10.941
there's a dark 10-foot tall,
shadow person,

30:10.943 --> 30:13.110
uh, hovering over him

30:13.511 --> 30:15.012
in his bed.

30:15.014 --> 30:20.284
I asked Brandy to sketch for
me one night, what she sees.

30:20.286 --> 30:24.154
I have it right here, Amy. This
is the sketch that Brandy did.

30:25.190 --> 30:27.057
[Amy] Whoa!

30:27.059 --> 30:28.525
I did have a sketch,

30:28.527 --> 30:32.963
uh, of what I saw
this old lady doing.

30:39.270 --> 30:42.105
It's an old lady but you might
not want to see the sketch.

30:44.008 --> 30:44.975
Wow!

30:45.910 --> 30:47.144
That's crazy.

30:47.478 --> 30:48.645
That's my side of the bed.

30:48.647 --> 30:51.882
That's what your arms do
when you're sleeping.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.117
You're fighting something
off when you're sleeping.

30:54.119 --> 30:57.187
Brandy tells me that
I'm in a defensive position,

30:57.189 --> 31:00.023
like, I'm trying to push
somebody away.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.191
[Brandy] He's terrified.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.926
- You've been shoved in bed, right?
- [Brandy] Oh yeah.

31:02.928 --> 31:04.661
Tell Amy what was
going on with that.

31:04.663 --> 31:07.898
It shoves my...
my right shoulder.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.001
Like, "Hey!" Pretty hard.
And it rocks me awake.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.036
[Steve] Brandy's also
been scratched.

31:13.038 --> 31:17.107
I actually got photos.
This is Brandy's scratches.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.377
[Brandy] On my arm there,
that was a--

31:20.379 --> 31:23.313
Almost, like a bruise from
the inside out, like a poke.

31:24.482 --> 31:27.517
And Mark, you had scratches
on your leg and shoulder, right?

31:27.519 --> 31:31.121
- Yes.
- [Steve] These are Mark's scratches, as well.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.993
Are these scratches coming
from the old woman?

31:35.995 --> 31:37.394
Or you think
it's something else?

31:37.396 --> 31:39.196
I think it's something else.

31:41.799 --> 31:45.602
Anything at all about who this
woman was when she was alive?

31:45.604 --> 31:50.641
I would put her, like,
probably in her late 70s,

31:50.643 --> 31:54.945
she kept talking about
the year 1996,

31:54.947 --> 31:59.650
and I felt like she used
to live there,

31:59.652 --> 32:05.789
but the house looks very
different through her eyes.

32:05.791 --> 32:09.126
She's freaking out, but there
was a specific incident

32:09.128 --> 32:12.462
involving a truck pulling up

32:12.464 --> 32:16.733
that she's extremely, uh,
upset about,

32:16.735 --> 32:20.904
and it's why she keeps trying
to wake everyone up.

32:20.906 --> 32:23.674
In 1996, an elderly woman
did live on your property.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.943
Her name was Frances Ruther.

32:25.945 --> 32:29.046
And in 1975, she bought the
land with her husband Arnold.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.915
They lived in the house
right next to you,

32:31.917 --> 32:34.584
and they used your property
for farmland.

32:34.586 --> 32:38.388
Now, they lived there together
for about 25 years.

32:38.390 --> 32:44.695
And, in 1994, Arnold suffered
a massive heart attack.

32:44.697 --> 32:45.862
Frances called for
the ambulance.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.097
She was watching it all happen

32:47.099 --> 32:50.667
and by the time they came
and brought him to the hospital,

32:50.669 --> 32:52.736
they announced him D.O.A.
at the hospital.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.471
He was probably dead
at the house.

32:54.839 --> 32:56.907
Now, you said 1996.

32:56.909 --> 32:58.875
- Hmm.
- [Steve] That happens to be the same year

32:58.877 --> 33:02.479
Frances had a new home
built on the property.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.780
And that's the house
you guys live in.

33:03.848 --> 33:05.749
Oh.

33:05.751 --> 33:09.052
Now, we're not really sure if she
actually lived in that house or not,

33:09.054 --> 33:11.488
either way, it seems it was
hard on her to stay there,

33:11.490 --> 33:12.823
and she sold the property.

33:12.825 --> 33:15.258
She moved out of town
and died in 2008.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.160
She was 84 when she died.

33:17.162 --> 33:21.198
So is it possible Frances could be
the woman that's bothering them?

33:21.933 --> 33:23.333
I would say so.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.071
<i>[Steve] What else did you see?</i>

33:28.073 --> 33:33.176
[Amy] So, one of the things I
noticed was that there is a lot of anger.

33:34.679 --> 33:41.084
When I walked into the garage
it got worse.

33:41.086 --> 33:45.055
I felt the energy
of a living male.

33:46.457 --> 33:48.091
<i>Just seeing like, a big guy,</i>

33:48.093 --> 33:49.760
<i>drinking alcohol</i>

33:49.762 --> 33:51.395
<i>and feeling very angry.</i>

33:52.964 --> 33:57.801
Then, I was hearing somebody
talking about death

33:57.803 --> 34:00.470
and somebody talking
about suicide.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.105
And I saw a gun.

34:06.844 --> 34:09.246
Now's the time to tell you
why we're in this library.

34:09.248 --> 34:12.249
Whenever Mark's in the house
he goes into rages,

34:12.251 --> 34:13.450
and he's not himself.

34:13.452 --> 34:14.851
[sighs heavily]

34:14.853 --> 34:17.988
Actually, these guys were afraid
if we did this in the house, um,

34:17.990 --> 34:20.090
you won't be able
to handle whatever you--

34:20.792 --> 34:22.626
Whatever news you gave him.

34:22.628 --> 34:26.396
Matter of fact, Brandy
actually thinks he's possessed.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.667
He's started changing.
Really changing.

34:30.669 --> 34:35.272
And his eyes get darker
and he's just not Mark.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.808
I have to stay away from him.

34:37.810 --> 34:42.212
Whenever I'm at home, I'm on
edge, I'm agitated all the time.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.747
It's affecting your marriage.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.982
Yes. Absolutely.

34:45.984 --> 34:47.818
I found something very odd
in your area.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.854
Amy, you mentioned suicide
and gun.

34:50.856 --> 34:55.892
I found there was five brutal
murder-suicides within a ten-year period.

34:55.894 --> 34:59.896
When you got five separate
ones in a ten-year period

34:59.898 --> 35:01.164
in an area where hardly
anybody lives,

35:01.166 --> 35:02.499
that's a lot.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.201
How far out did you go?

35:04.203 --> 35:06.169
But they were all within a
couple of miles of the house.

35:06.171 --> 35:06.670
- [Amy] Really?
- Yeah.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.371
Oh, boy.

35:10.608 --> 35:15.979
[Amy] Now, where is this anger
coming from? All right.

35:15.981 --> 35:20.784
<i>When I went out back
and to the left,</i>

35:20.786 --> 35:26.857
I encountered what I initially
thought was an animal,

35:26.859 --> 35:28.859
uh, but I'm like,
"Oh, it's not."

35:28.861 --> 35:31.795
It's actually a deceased female.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.799
What I got was that
she had been buried,

35:35.801 --> 35:39.536
I think alive and left for dead.

35:39.538 --> 35:43.773
She has become animalistic
in nature

35:43.775 --> 35:50.881
because all she's being driven
by now is revenge and rage.

35:50.883 --> 35:53.884
I really couldn't get, like,
when she died,

35:53.886 --> 35:57.821
I would say 1940 until now.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.089
I got the name Bobby.

35:59.091 --> 36:03.693
And I also heard the number 150.

36:03.695 --> 36:08.298
As far as, this dead woman you
saw, uh, you said 1940s and 150.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.902
Now, I came across a pretty
tragic story during my research.

36:11.904 --> 36:15.472
But, before I get to that, Amy, you should
know a couple of miles behind the house,

36:15.474 --> 36:17.407
is a military base
called Fort Lewis.

36:17.409 --> 36:21.645
The base has a wooded area that's
become a dumping ground for murder victims.

36:21.647 --> 36:25.515
Nearly a hundred bodies have been
recovered from there over the years.

36:25.517 --> 36:29.486
One of them was a 17-year-old
girl named Noreen McNicholas.

36:29.488 --> 36:34.824
In November of 1948, she left
home to go to school and vanished.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.294
Her body, that was
badly decomposed,

36:37.296 --> 36:40.030
was found in a swampy
shallow grave.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.933
Autopsy showed that she had been
badly beaten and strangled to death.

36:42.935 --> 36:45.468
The case went cold
for a few years.

36:45.470 --> 36:50.473
At that time two enlisted men took their dates
to the area where Noreen's body was found.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.443
And this is where
it gets a little strange.

36:53.445 --> 36:56.913
One of the girls, an
18-year-old named Ella Cooper

36:56.915 --> 37:00.283
started panicking and
screamed out, "Noreen, lookout."

37:00.518 --> 37:02.018
Huh?

37:02.086 --> 37:05.855
Luckily, there was a cop nearby and
heard that and went over to investigate.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.725
Turns out Ella was with Noreen
the day she was murdered.

37:08.727 --> 37:12.829
She said that she and Noreen
went to the park with two men.

37:12.831 --> 37:16.099
So, one of the guy's name was Bill Smith
and the other guy she only knew was Bob.

37:16.101 --> 37:18.535
Apparently Noreen wasn't
interested in Bill.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.004
So he killed her
in a jealous rage.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.707
Detectives tracked him down
and he was convicted

37:23.709 --> 37:25.508
and sentenced to life in prison.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.778
Now, Ella ended up giving
a description of this guy Bob.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.747
It's a big coincidence,
but the journalist I spoke to

37:30.749 --> 37:34.384
said the cops got a 150 leads
on this guy

37:34.386 --> 37:36.453
but not one of them worked out.

37:37.855 --> 37:41.958
I had a sketch done of how
she's now projecting herself.

37:50.868 --> 37:53.203
It's pretty macabre. Uff.

37:56.173 --> 37:57.407
Weird.

37:59.477 --> 38:01.177
Half dog, half human.

38:01.979 --> 38:03.513
That's pretty creepy.

38:03.515 --> 38:07.584
[Amy] You have to understand,
she is full of rage.

38:07.586 --> 38:11.121
She's responsible for a lot of
the physical attacks in the house

38:11.123 --> 38:14.991
and that's where the anger's
coming from, it's from her.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.895
But she's really mad at men,

38:18.897 --> 38:21.898
and I'm worried about
what she can do to you.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.901
That could become
a very volatile situation

38:24.903 --> 38:29.806
where Mark may harm himself
or harm others.

38:29.808 --> 38:33.777
Something's got to be done.
I can't... I can't do that.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.012
No. I can't.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.284
I knew it. I knew it was me.

38:57.768 --> 39:02.605
So, now we know what's been attacking
both you guys and keeping you up at night.

39:02.607 --> 39:05.809
Mark, now we know what's
causing you to fly off the handle.

39:05.811 --> 39:09.946
But, the big question is can
you fight back, kick all of that out

39:09.948 --> 39:13.149
and go on living
a good normal life?

39:13.151 --> 39:15.418
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:19.523 --> 39:25.862
I don't think that
it's particularly safe

39:25.864 --> 39:32.969
for you guys to continue
living in that environment.

39:32.971 --> 39:36.639
And the feeling
that I got is that

39:36.641 --> 39:41.044
that's going to get
progressively worse.

39:42.680 --> 39:48.318
So, my suggestion would
be for you guys to relocate.

39:53.924 --> 40:00.563
It's heartbreaking to know that
there's just no way I can salvage this.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.767
[Steve] Believe me, Amy doesn't
want to tell anybody to leave their home.

40:03.769 --> 40:09.038
But it sounds like if you stay
there's going to be a problem.

40:09.040 --> 40:15.178
And it would be really awesome
if you could have a medium

40:15.180 --> 40:18.114
come and help
the little lady move on.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.449
Yeah.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.752
That would be awesome.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.421
As far as that dead girl goes,
I mean...

40:25.756 --> 40:27.424
[Amy] I'm taking her home.

40:29.627 --> 40:32.462
I'm going to collect her
and help her move on.

40:33.864 --> 40:37.233
Okay. So, I know the house
means a lot to you guys,

40:37.235 --> 40:41.104
but are you gonna leave it behind
and get a fresh start some place else?

40:42.473 --> 40:44.140
Oh, absolutely.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.875
- [Steve] Okay.
- [Mark] Absolutely.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.177
- Absolutely.
- [Mark] It's--

40:47.179 --> 40:48.711
It's just a house.

40:48.713 --> 40:51.981
Will they start feeling better
like, right away when they move?

40:51.983 --> 40:53.883
- Or is it gonna take a little bit of time?
- [Amy] Oh, yeah.

40:53.885 --> 40:56.453
Hmm. Yeah.
When they move. Yeah.

40:56.455 --> 40:57.654
You got to be relieved to know

40:57.656 --> 41:00.457
- that he'll be himself once again.
- [Brandy] Yes.

41:00.459 --> 41:01.658
- [Steve] At some point.
- [Brandy] Yes.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.927
Family's going to
come together. [laughs]

41:03.929 --> 41:06.095
[Steve] It's the first time I've
seen you two smile since I met you.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.430
[Brandy laughing]

41:09.800 --> 41:11.067
Thank you.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.102
Thank you so much.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.706
<i>[Amy] I feel really bad
for Brandy and Mark.</i>

41:16.708 --> 41:20.043
<i>But in a situation
as dangerous as this,</i>

41:20.045 --> 41:22.045
<i>I think it's best
they leave their home.</i>

41:22.047 --> 41:24.214
Hopefully, they take my advice,

41:24.216 --> 41:26.850
find a medium to move
the old lady on,

41:26.852 --> 41:29.285
and get a fresh start
somewhere new.

41:34.191 --> 41:36.893
We did have a medium come out...

41:36.895 --> 41:38.661
Who helped move Frances on.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.397
<i>He also helped me
with my chakras.</i>

41:41.399 --> 41:44.901
<i>The anger isn't nearly as
prevalent like it was before.</i>

41:44.903 --> 41:48.771
<i>And we're looking into the housing
market and keeping up on that.</i>

41:48.773 --> 41:52.876
<i>So that we can hopefully
find a new home.</i>

41:52.878 --> 41:56.980
So, we just wanted to say thank
you very much for coming out.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.448
Thank you very much.

41:58.450 --> 42:00.016
You guys are wonderful.
