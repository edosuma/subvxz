A clean, crisp sound
that gets me right here.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.354
And if you lick their tears
when it happens...

12:05.759 --> 12:08.393
They warped me, too.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.361
They added a beast
inside me, too,

12:10.363 --> 12:14.199
And he is --
he's a really good guy.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.868
He's so much fun.
You'd like him.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.404
But i do not
let him out.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.873
Ever.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.410
Not when i fight, not when
i kill, not when i hurt,

12:25.412 --> 12:28.079
Because he's not
allowed out to play.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.516
He's not invited.
He's behind lock and key.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.885
You have to
keep your guy in, huck.

12:33.887 --> 12:38.056
You have to lock him in
all the time.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.058
Otherwise, one day,

12:40.060 --> 12:43.895
He will be strong enough
to lock you in,

12:43.897 --> 12:46.264
And you'll
never get out.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.002
Liv.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.437
Liv locks him in.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.273
She locks him in for me.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.143
You got to learn
to do it on your own.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.152

If we lose --
if we lose liv for good,

13:21.201 --> 13:26.037
I know what she is to you,
i know how important she is,

13:26.039 --> 13:30.074
I know you need her,
but i need you.

13:30.076 --> 13:34.045
You may be liv's...

13:34.047 --> 13:36.181
Puppy, but...

13:36.183 --> 13:38.049
I'm kind of yours.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.419
It won't happen again.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.088
I need you to say it --

13:44.090 --> 13:48.092
If liv gets sold,
if we lose her,

13:48.094 --> 13:50.528
You won't kill anyone.

13:50.530 --> 13:55.066
If we lose liv,
i won't kill anyone.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.367
No more blood.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.204
No more blood.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.772
I promise.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.242
Elizabeth: Hello?

14:04.244 --> 14:07.412
Help you
with something?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.913
Can i speak to you?

14:08.915 --> 14:10.982
Is that possible --

14:10.984 --> 14:14.619
You and i can speak and...
You won't do anything to me?

14:15.989 --> 14:18.223
We can speak.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.892
[<i> camera shutter clicking</i> ]

14:20.894 --> 14:22.961
I'm out of the loop.
I'm out in the cold again.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.263
They're shutting me out.
They won't tell me a thing.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.599
Wait.
Have you talked to them?

14:27.601 --> 14:30.235
No, because the white house
doesn't totally trust me,

14:30.237 --> 14:31.569
Which is sadly
becoming my legacy

14:31.571 --> 14:33.071
Here at
the justice department.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.405
I bet they
received intelligence

14:34.407 --> 14:36.074
That narrowed down
her location.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.942
That's what
the cheering was about.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.011
Now they'll be able to
extract her safely.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.613
I'm sure
that's the plan.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.349
Or...
Or what?

14:44.351 --> 14:45.416
You know what?
Never mind.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.018
Or what?
It's my anxiety talking.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.653
You know i always
work myself up,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.989
Go to the worst-case scenario.
Or what, david?!

14:50.991 --> 14:52.624
Someone
extremely dangerous

14:52.626 --> 14:54.592
Has the president
on a leash.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.895
Olivia pope is that leash.
So?

14:56.897 --> 14:59.497
So, at what point is it easier
to just cut him loose?

14:59.499 --> 15:02.133
You mean...?
Burn the leash,
remove the threat,

15:02.135 --> 15:03.935
Neutralize the asset.

15:03.937 --> 15:08.172
T-the president
would never allow that.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.041
You know what?
You're right.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.542
Even the thought
is just --

15:11.544 --> 15:14.479
I mean, he would never e--
never even go there.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.513
Forget i said it.
You're right.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.015
Of course i'm right.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.254
Of course i'm right.

What do you want?

15:26.660 --> 15:27.926
Andrew nichols.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.578
What about him?

15:29.579 --> 15:31.229
He signed an amnesty deal
this morning.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.965
He's gonna get away
with everything.
I've got work to do.

15:37.203 --> 15:40.505
I've accepted responsibility
for my part in all this.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.141
I don't sleep ever.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.311
And yet this this man -- the man
responsible for all of it --

15:46.313 --> 15:47.578
Is about to skate!

15:47.580 --> 15:51.249
So you came here
to discuss justice?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.517
You're looking
for justice.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.186
I need power.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.056
This will give me power.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.991
Look, i'm not asking you
to do anything you don't...

15:59.993 --> 16:02.794
Do already.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.596
I can even pay you if that's
necessary, if you will just...

16:05.598 --> 16:08.132
Kill him? Is that it?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.634
You want me
to kill him?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.236
Just do
whatever it is you do.

16:12.238 --> 16:15.406
You have free rein,
full creative control.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.008
Just make him pay.

16:17.010 --> 16:20.111
Make...Him...Hurt.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.248

We're coming.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.560
What i am about to say

16:52.561 --> 16:54.478
Will never be spoken about again
outside this room.

16:54.481 --> 16:58.149
She is precious to him,
you understand?

16:58.151 --> 17:02.186
She is his beating heart held
in the hands of his enemies.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.322
With her, they can bend him,
they can break him,

17:04.324 --> 17:06.190
They can make the
president of the united states

17:06.192 --> 17:09.127
Dance like a monkey
at a county fair.

17:09.129 --> 17:12.163

his heart is out there,

God knows who else,
we are screwed.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.806
We stop it.

17:21.808 --> 17:25.209
We stop
that beating heart.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.680
And that, my friend,

17:29.682 --> 17:32.350
Is what your president
would want us to do.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.353
It is what he would demand
that we do.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.821
If his heart
were not out there,

17:36.823 --> 17:40.358
If it were in here,
he would do it himself.

17:40.360 --> 17:45.129
So, we do
what he cannot do.

17:45.131 --> 17:48.366
We may need to
neutralize the asset.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.669
I agree.

Behind
the president's back.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.424

You're way out
of line here, red.

near the security clearance

To take part
in this discussion.

Well, i know someone who does,
and he's right down the hall,

18:21.768 --> 18:23.634

gonna be the least bit
happy when he finds out --

Olivia is the godmother
of my baby and my friend.

i will avoid at all costs

18:48.261 --> 18:50.161

18:50.163 --> 18:52.347
But the fate
of our nation

and liberty of one individual.

don't you?
