TAKING A BREAK FROM DATING
IS THE BEST.

00:03.837 --> 00:08.409
ALL THE ENERGY YOU ONCE SPENT
PREPPING AND PLANNING FOR DATES

00:08.442 --> 00:11.779
CAN BE PUT TO BETTER USE,
LIKE PURSUING OLD PASSIONS.

MISS HAVING A BOYFRIEND.

EXCEPT WHEN YOU HAVE
ELECTIVE SURGERY

00:18.686 --> 00:21.355
TO UNWEB YOUR TOES AND THERE'S
NO ONE TO TAKE YOU HOME.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.324
SO THERE'S NO ONE
TO TAKE YOU HOME?

00:23.357 --> 00:25.593
MY HUSBAND'S WAITING
DOWNSTAIRS FOR ME,

00:25.626 --> 00:27.461

MA'AM, YOU'RE
HEAVILY MEDICATED.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.065
DUH. I KNOW.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.167

PICKS ME UP, TAKES ME AWAY.

OH, IT'S YOU,
OFFICER HANDSOME AND MAD.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.781
I'M NOT DRUNK, OFFICER.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.151
I AM UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF DRUGS,

I KNEW IT, YOU'RE TOO HANDSOME!
YOU'RE LIKE TED BUNDY!

THAT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU.

ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES
OF BEING ON A GUY-HIATUS

01:19.413 --> 01:22.216
IS THAT I DON'T HAVE ANYONE
TO DO HOUSEHOLD CHORES FOR ME

01:22.250 --> 01:23.217
THAT I USUALLY HAVE A GUY DO.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.552

I WOULD JUST RENT

UNTIL I MET MY HUSBAND, AND
I WOULD JUST MOVE IN WITH HIM,

02:36.624 --> 02:39.393
AND THEN I'D BE LIKE, "HONEY,
GET THIS PORNO OUT OF HERE.

YOU CAN FIND
PLENTY OF PEOPLE

06:02.095 --> 06:03.731
YEAH.
IT'S IN TRIBECA.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.833
IT'S HALF THE PRICE
OF THIS PLACE.

IT'S GREAT, DANNY.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.736
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT IT EARLIER?

06:08.769 --> 06:12.773
WELL, THERE'S A CATCH.
THE APARTMENT'S IN MY BUILDING.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.676
THERE'S ANOTHER CATCH.
I OWN THE APARTMENT.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.411
HMM.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.449
THIS PLACE HAS BEEN
PROFESSIONALLY STAGED.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.484
OH, MY GOD.

THANK YOU.
HOLD ON.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.755
HOLD ON A SECOND.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.090
HOW CAN YOU AFFORD
TO HAVE TWO APARTMENTS?

06:30.123 --> 06:33.160
OH, I KNOW, DID YOU BUY THEM
FOR, LIKE, A THOUSAND BUCKS

06:33.193 --> 06:34.995
IN THE '60s
WHEN LINDSAY WAS MAYOR?

06:35.028 --> 06:36.830
I WAS ONE YEARS OLD
WHEN LINDSAY WAS IN OFFICE.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.832
SO YOU ADMIT THAT YOU WERE
ALIVE, YOU OLD CRONE.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.701

AFTER I WENT

06:46.907 --> 06:49.677
REALLY?
YEAH.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.813
I LOVE IT, BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'D BE, LIKE, A LITTLE WEIRD

06:52.846 --> 06:55.215
WITH ME LIVING DOWN THE HALLWAY,
GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.751
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW,
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WEIRD,

06:57.785 --> 06:58.919
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS
NOW, RIGHT?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.521
YEAH, WE'RE FRIENDS.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.522
TELL YOU WHAT,
HERE'S WHAT WE DO,

07:01.555 --> 07:03.724
STAY HERE A COUPLE NIGHTS,
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.926

IF YOU LIKE IT, YOU BUY IT.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.720
I'M HARD "R," SON.
I'M NOT GOING.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.855
WAIT, YOU'RE NOT GOING?
THEN I'LL GO.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.890
UNLESS YOU TOLD HER YOU WERE
GONNA PAY FOR DINNER.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.026
LAUREN'S A TOTAL CATCH.
SHE'S A BRAIN SURGEON.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.962
BRAIN SURGEON?
NOPE, DEFINITELY NOT GOING.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.964
WHOA!
SHE'S A BRAIN SURGEON?

07:43.997 --> 07:46.500
SO SHE CAN PAY FOR DINNER.
I'M BACK IN.

07:46.534 --> 07:49.069
SHE'S SMART, SHE'S SUCCESSFUL.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

07:49.102 --> 07:50.571
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.740
SHE'S A SINGLE MOM,
SHE'S A NEUROSURGEON,

07:52.773 --> 07:55.075
HER NAME DOESN'T END IN AN "I"
WITH A HEART ABOVE IT.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.209
THIS IS NOT WHO I DATE.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.646
MAYBE YOU NEED
A REAL ADULT WOMAN

07:58.679 --> 08:01.815
WITH REAL ADULT
RESPONSIBILITIES.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.151
THE DATE DOES START IN
15 MINUTES AND I AM STARVING,

08:04.184 --> 08:07.187
SO...SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.
I WILL GO.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.589
THERE'S A MAN, PETER.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.958
WHOO!
I'M SO EXCITED.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.927
WHAT SHOULD I BRING?
I CAN'T AFFORD NORMAL WINE.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.529
HMM.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.598
(Danny)
HEY, I WAS AT TARGET, I SAW
A COUPLE THINGS YOU MIGHT NEED.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.633
OH!
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.668
I WISH YOU HAD TOLD ME
YOU WERE GOING.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.935
MY WHOLE OUTFIT'S FROM THERE.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.804
I WOULD'VE ASKED YOU
TO PICK ME UP SOME BRAS.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.839
OKAY, WEIGHTS?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.174
I FIND THIS VERY POINTED.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.876
I DON'T NEED THESE.
I ALREADY HAVE HUGE GUNS.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.880
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I SHOULD BE
GETTING BACK TO MY PLACE.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.816
OH, NO, WHAT'S WRONG?
DID SOMEONE DIE HERE?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.851
I KNEW IT!
LUCKILY FOR YOU,

08:37.885 --> 08:39.152
GHOSTS LOVE ME.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE AN ISSUE.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.554
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

08:40.588 --> 08:42.723
WELL, I DID JUST HAVE
AN ENORMOUS MEAL,

08:42.756 --> 08:45.826
BUT A DOCTOR TOLD ME
THAT MY METABOLISM IS SO HIGH

08:45.859 --> 08:47.628
THAT I BASICALLY
HAVE TO EAT EVERY HOUR.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.896
THAT DOCTOR WAS ME.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.999
GREAT, LET'S ORDER A PIZZA,
GO BACK TO MY PLACE?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.000
OKAY.
OKAY.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.235
YEAH.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.036
[suspenseful music]

08:56.069 --> 08:57.905
OH, NO.
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.674
DANNY, DANNY, DANNY,
THIS HUSBAND IS BAD NEWS.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.342
YOU THINK? THE MOVIE'S CALLED
DEATH HONEYMOON,

09:02.375 --> 09:05.045
AND HE'S SUGGESTED THEY GO
SCUBA DIVING LIKE NINE TIMES.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.116
WHAT?

09:09.149 --> 09:10.751
WHAT?
WHAT?

09:10.784 --> 09:13.120
I--THIS IS
UNEXPECTEDLY NICE.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.055
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WEIRD,
BUT IT'S NOT.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.224
I TOLD YOU IT'D BE GOOD THAT
WE LIVED IN THE SAME BUILDING.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.127
OH, GOD, HE'S GONNA STRANGLE
JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.095
I ALWAYS REALLY LIKED HER.
EH.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.098
SHE'S GOT A GREAT...
BODY OF WORK.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.099
OKAY, I'M GOING.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.901
OKAY.
NO, NO, NO, STAY, STAY.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.937
YOU KNOW, I WAS ABLE TO SCORE
THIS PRIME TABLE

09:29.970 --> 09:31.805
'CAUSE I'M PERSONALLY FRIENDS
WITH THE CHEF.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.174
WE'RE BETWEEN THE BATHROOM
AND THE LITTLE HALLWAY

09:34.207 --> 09:36.143
WHERE THE BUSBOYS
TAKE THEIR BREAK.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.178
IT'S PRIVATE.
[chuckles]

09:38.211 --> 09:40.648
FEEL FREE TO ORDER
WHATEVER YOU WANT ON THE MENU.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.283
DON'T BE SCARED OFF BY THE "MP,"
WHICH MEANS MARKET PRICE.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.152
OH, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
JUST ORDER FOR ME

09:45.185 --> 09:46.153
'CAUSE I'M ILLITERATE.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.755
YEAH, TOTALLY.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.123
THEY HAVE OYSTERS
ON THE HALF SHELL--

09:50.157 --> 09:52.793
I'M KIDDING.
I CAN READ!

09:52.826 --> 09:53.861
IT WAS A JOKE.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.395
[chuckles]
I'M SORRY, I DON'T--

09:55.428 --> 09:56.596
I'M NOT USED TO DATING
SMART GIRLS.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.899
I MEAN, MOST OF THE GIRLS
THAT I DATE WOULD BE IMPRESSED

09:58.932 --> 10:02.235
WITH SOMETHING LAME,
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.937
WHOA.
OOH.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.038
DAVID LAME.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.707
[both laughing]

10:06.740 --> 10:09.176
SO WHEN YOU GO OUT WITH THESE
GIRLS, WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT?

10:09.209 --> 10:13.013
YOU KNOW, THEIR BORING FRIENDS,
THEIR MADE-UP GLUTEN ALLERGIES,

10:13.046 --> 10:15.048
THEIR RESCUE DOGS.
I DON'T--I ZONE OUT MOSTLY.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.818
PEOPLE WHO BRAG ABOUT RESCUING
THEIR PETS ARE THE WORST.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.719
RIGHT?
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED

10:18.752 --> 10:20.220
TO TELL ANYONE
WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING GOOD.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.123
EXACTLY, I HAVE BEEN
SAYING THAT FOR SO LONG.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.826
LIKE, THERE'S THIS CHARITY THAT
I JUST STARTED GIVING MONEY TO.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.928
IT'S--IT'S FOR--

10:27.961 --> 10:29.129
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.130
[laughs]

10:30.163 --> 10:31.832
IT'S JUMP ROPES FOR FAT KIDS!

10:31.865 --> 10:33.033
[both laughing]

10:33.066 --> 10:34.968
FEELS GOOD TO GET IT OUT.
YEAH.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.336
(Danny)
HEY, MIN,
RICHIE AND HIS BOYFRIEND

10:36.369 --> 10:38.305
ARE COMING IN TONIGHT.
I'M GONNA PICK UP SOME TAKEOUT.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.340
I KNOW FAMILY STYLE
STRESSES YOU OUT,

10:40.373 --> 10:41.975
SO YOU CAN GO FIRST.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

10:42.009 --> 10:44.011
OH, MAN, I HAVE
SO MUCH WORK TONIGHT,

10:44.044 --> 10:45.813
I CAN'T, BUT I'LL BE HOME
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.280
OKAY, JUST KNOCK ON MY DOOR
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.415
OKAY, BYE.
BYE.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.283
THE HELL WAS THAT?

10:50.317 --> 10:53.020
OKAY, I'M THINKING
ABOUT BUYING AN APARTMENT

10:53.053 --> 10:53.821
IN DANNY'S BUILDING
THAT HE OWNS,

10:53.854 --> 10:54.888
SO I'M STAYING THERE
FOR THE WEEK.

10:54.922 --> 10:58.025
I REALIZE THAT I'VE BEEN
ON ONE ADULT DATE IN MY LIFE

10:58.058 --> 10:59.927
AND I AM NOT AT THE PLACE
WHERE I SHOULD BE GIVING ADVICE

10:59.960 --> 11:02.329
ON RELATIONSHIPS,
BUT THAT IS A BAD IDEA.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.596
WHY? DANNY AND I
ARE FRIENDS AGAIN.

11:03.630 --> 11:07.200
NO, NO, YOU ARE NOT HIS FRIEND.
HE'S TRYING TO KEEP TABS ON YOU.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.970
IT'S LIKE WHEN HEFNER LETS
A PLAYMATE STAY IN HIS MANSION.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.705
THERE ARE STRINGS ATTACHED:
NO BOYFRIENDS,

11:11.739 --> 11:13.373
YOU HAVE TO WATCH
AN OLD MAN EAT SOUP,

11:13.406 --> 11:16.009
OCCASIONALLY SCOTT BAIO WILL
WALK IN ON YOU IN THE BATHROOM.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.377
I CAN HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.411
REALLY?

11:18.445 --> 11:19.479
SO DANNY WOULDN'T BE MAD
IF YOU BROUGHT A BOY HOME?

11:19.512 --> 11:23.150
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE MAD
IF DANNY BROUGHT A GIRL HOME?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.318
DANNY CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.
I'LL BE TOO BUSY

11:25.352 --> 11:28.889
SLAYING GUYS' BRAINS OUT
IN MY APARTMENT TO EVEN NOTICE.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.994
[phone ringing]
HI.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.462
HEY, CHARLIE, IT'S MINDY.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.330
I TOLD YOU, YOU CAN'T HAVE
A HANDICAPPED PARKING PERMIT.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.966
WHY DO YOU EVEN NEED ONE?
YOU DON'T DRIVE.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.834
SUE ME,
I LIKE EXCLUSIVE THINGS,

11:40.868 --> 11:41.802
BUT IT'S NOT THAT.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.037
I WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU HAD
ANY PLANS TONIGHT.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.105
THOUGHT YOU SWORE OFF MEN.

11:45.138 --> 11:48.075
I DID, THAT IS A GOOD POINT,
BUT THIS IS NOT A DATE.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.043
THIS IS JUST ME
MAKING YOU DINNER

11:50.077 --> 11:53.013
TO THANK YOU FOR THE OTHER DAY.
DO YOU LIKE BALOGNA SANDWICHES?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.081
I DO NOT.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.883
WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.951
(Danny)
RAMON, IT'S NICE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.887
RICHIE SAYS
YOU WORK IN FASHION.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.089
YEAH, HE DESIGNS UNDERWEAR
WITH THE BUTT CUT OUT.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.857
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.894
(Ramon)
YOU GIVE ME ANY GARMENT,
I TAKE THE BUTT OUT OF IT.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.095
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.903
GUYS, GRAB A COUPLE BEERS,
THROW ON A RECORD.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.939
BE RIGHT BACK.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.446
RAMON, I GOT A FASHION
QUESTION FOR YOU.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.949
BROWN WORK BOOTS, THAT'S
IN FASHION FOR WOMEN, RIGHT?

12:28.982 --> 12:31.418
YEAH, THOSE ARE IN FASHION...
IN HELL.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.820
[both laughing]

12:32.853 --> 12:34.788
DANNY, WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY YOU SO WOUND UP?

12:34.822 --> 12:36.489
POPE FRANCIS TRY SURFING
OR SOMETHING?

12:36.523 --> 12:37.991
WHY'S THAT GUY SO CHILL?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.961
IT'S NOT THAT, IT'S--

12:40.994 --> 12:43.463
SEE? THERE'S THE LITTLE DIPPER
RIGHT THERE.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.631
IT'S JUST,
THERE'S SO MANY STARS,

12:44.664 --> 12:46.499
AND YOU'RE JUST KIND OF POINTING
TO MANY THOUSANDS OF THEM,

12:46.533 --> 12:47.300
SO I CAN'T--

12:47.334 --> 12:48.401
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A GREAT VIEW

12:48.435 --> 12:51.371
OF THE METEOR SHOWER TOMORROW.
ARE YOU INTO ASTRONOMY?

12:51.404 --> 12:54.507
I THINK I AM, YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE I'M VERY INTO ASTROLOGY,

12:54.541 --> 12:57.110
AND ONE TIME, SOMEONE THOUGHT
I LOOKED LIKE THAT BLACK LADY

12:57.144 --> 12:58.511
FROM THE OLD STAR TREK, SO--

12:58.545 --> 13:00.413
[chuckles]
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE YOU GOT.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.581
HOW'D YOU FIND IT?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.416
A CO-WORKER OF MINE
IS SELLING IT TO ME.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.853
WELL, HEY, THERE'S NO SHAME
IN GETTING A DEAL.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.087
I GOT MY HOUSE CHEAP

13:07.120 --> 13:08.121
'CAUSE JOHN GOTTI KILLED
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THERE.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.422
OH, GOD.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.591
WELL, I GUESS I'M PRETTY
SELF-RELIANT AFTER ALL, HUH?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.493
BUYING MY OWN PLACE.
I COOKED DINNER

13:13.526 --> 13:15.595
FROM JARS OF FOOD
THAT I OPENED MYSELF.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.064
[fire alarm beeping]

13:17.097 --> 13:18.866
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD, THE BEEPING.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.267
MAKE THE BEEPING STOP!
YOU KNOW WHAT,

13:20.300 --> 13:21.401
LET'S JUST FORGET IT,
LET'S JUST FORGET IT.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.302
LET'S JUST ABANDON
THIS APARTMENT AND GO!

13:22.335 --> 13:23.837
ALL RIGHT, GET THE FOOD
OUT OF THE OVEN.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.505
I'LL GET THIS.
OKAY.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.573
OH, GOD!
NO, NO, NO!

13:26.606 --> 13:29.542
EXTINGUISHER IN CLOSET!
SCARED! BABY! NEED MAN HELP!

13:29.576 --> 13:31.011
OH, GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.279
ARE YOU INSANE?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THAT!

13:32.312 --> 13:34.147
SURE YOU DO. WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WERE HERE BY YOURSELF?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.283
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST PRAY FOR DEATH.
JUST DO IT.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.851
OH, GOD.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.522
YOU DID IT!

13:42.555 --> 13:44.491
OH, MY GOD!

13:44.524 --> 13:45.558
THAT WAS AMAZING!

13:45.592 --> 13:47.460
AM I, LIKE,
A BRAVE FIREFIGHTER NOW?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.596
[scoffs] FIREFIGHTERS.
THEY DON'T EVEN CARRY GUNS.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.898
WELL,
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,

13:50.931 --> 13:53.066
DINNER IS COVERED
IN EXTINGUISHER FOAM,

13:53.100 --> 13:55.035
ALTHOUGH, I BET YOU WE COULD
SCRAPE OFF THAT TOP LAYER AND--

13:55.068 --> 13:56.536
I'LL MAKE SOMETHING.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.472
WHEN JENNY'S MOM LEFT, I GOT
GOOD AT COOKING AND GIRLS' HAIR.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.909
YOU WANT A FRENCH TWIST
WITH TENDRILS, I'M YOUR GUY.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.543
OKAY.
[laughs]

14:03.576 --> 14:04.945
HEY, NEIGHBOR.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.446
I WAS HANGING OUT
IN THE HALLWAY,

14:06.479 --> 14:07.514
AND I THOUGHT I HEARD
THE SMOKE ALARM.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.882
DID YOU LIGHT
TOO MANY OF THOSE

14:08.916 --> 14:10.217
CINNAMON ROLL-SCENTED CANDLES
AGAIN?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.152
WHAT, ARE YOU BURNING DOWN
MY APARTMENT?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.453
IT'S MY PLACE.
I OWN TWO IN THE BUILDING.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.555
CHARLIE, THIS IS DANNY.
DANNY, CHARLIE.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.090
CHARLIE?

14:19.259 --> 14:21.461
COOL NAME, GREAT HANDSHAKE.

14:21.494 --> 14:25.465
SO--
[groans]

14:25.498 --> 14:28.435
SO WHAT YOU KIDS
UP TO TONIGHT?

14:28.468 --> 14:31.604
HEY, MAN, MY DATE WITH LAUREN
WAS AMAZING.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.940
YOU KNOW,
IT'S MAKING ME RETHINK

14:32.973 --> 14:35.142
THAT WHOLE BOOK-LEARNING
FOR WOMEN THING.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.211
YEAH, THAT'S INTERESTING
AND GOOD.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.446
THE THING IS,
I DID TALK TO LAUREN,

14:39.479 --> 14:41.348
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.382
OOH, WATER FEATURES.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.451
WHAT?
SHE'S NEGGING ME?

14:44.484 --> 14:45.452
[sighs]

14:45.485 --> 14:46.619
A MOM CAN'T NEG A NORMAL.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.255
SHE THINKS YOU'RE FUN,
PETER,

14:48.288 --> 14:50.023
BUT I THINK SHE WANTS
SOMEBODY MORE MATURE.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.626
MORE MATURE?
AW!

14:53.660 --> 14:56.496
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!
I'M, LIKE, SO MATURE!

14:56.529 --> 14:57.664
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I DON'T NEED HER

14:57.697 --> 15:01.001
AND HER STUPID,
STUCK-UP BRAIN SURGEON JOB

15:01.034 --> 15:03.336
OR HER STUPID,
STUCK-UP BABY!

15:03.370 --> 15:04.972
AND THEY SHOULDN'T
REFURBISH BARNS!

15:05.005 --> 15:06.606
THEY SHOULD LEAVE 'EM RUSTIC!

15:06.639 --> 15:09.142
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR CHECKING IN, DANNY.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.278
HOPE YOU ENJOYED
THE PISTACHIOS.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.646
I THINK IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD--

15:13.680 --> 15:15.382
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE
CONVERSATION WITH YOUR FRIEND.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.549
SO, DETECTIVE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.519
DID YOU FIGURE OUT MINDY WAS
THE GREAT TRIBECA DONUT THIEF?

15:19.552 --> 15:23.356
HA HA HA.
MINDY INVITED ME.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.293
DO I DETECT A SLIGHT ACCENT?
WHERE YOU FROM AGAIN?

15:26.326 --> 15:27.327
STATEN ISLAND.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.262
OH, YEAH?
I'M FROM STATEN ISLAND.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.463
BUT YOU PROBABLY
DON'T KNOW THE AREA,

15:30.497 --> 15:33.066
IT'S A REAL ROUGH PART.
MARINERS HARBOR.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.368
OH, YEAH, WE USED TO CALL YOU
THE RICH KIDS.

15:35.402 --> 15:36.503
I'M FROM PORT DOGKILL.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.537
ON THE RIVER SIDE?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.572
NO, THE GARBAGE DUMP SIDE.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.609
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING
OVER THERE?

15:42.642 --> 15:44.444
SAUCE.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.280
SAUCE.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.517
NEW YORK NEIGHBORHOODS...
IT'S INTERESTING--

15:50.550 --> 15:51.518
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS,

15:51.551 --> 15:53.220
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS BEFORE.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.555
RICHIE AND RAMON
ARE OVER AT MY PLACE.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.457
THEY'RE TEST-DRIVING OUT
MY NEW MICRO-BREW,

15:57.490 --> 15:59.659
DOCTOR DAN'S SUMMERTIME
SNICKERDOODLE ALE.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.694
I DON'T WANT TO--I DON'T WANT
TO BREAK UP A DATE, BUT--

16:01.728 --> 16:03.130
IT'S NOT A DATE.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.164
NOT?

16:08.268 --> 16:11.204
OH, BOY, LOOK AT THAT.
I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE STATION.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.739
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.507
NO, THERE'S BEEN
A BRUTAL MURDER.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.609
YEAH, LET THE MAN
DO HIS JOB.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.680
OH, CHAZ, WELL,
TAKE A RAIN CHECK, PAL.

16:21.648 --> 16:25.352
GOOD GUY,
I LIKE THAT GUY.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.687
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S A REAL COP,
BUT I LIKE HIM.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.289
DAMN IT, IT'S REALLY GOOD.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.626
ANGI WAS YOUR NAME?
ANGI WITH AN "I."

16:33.660 --> 16:35.295
YOU PUT A HEART OVER THAT,
I BET.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.363
SOMETIMES.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.564
WHEN DON'T YOU?

16:37.597 --> 16:38.598
OH, IF I DO A STAR.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.168
[laughs]
TERRIFIC!

16:41.201 --> 16:42.202
YEAH.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.071
SO...YOU WANT TO SEE
A TRICK?

16:44.104 --> 16:46.106
YEAH.
NORMAL NAPKIN, RIGHT?

16:46.139 --> 16:47.307
UH-HUH.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.410
[screams]

16:50.443 --> 16:52.045
OH!
NO, NO, CALM DOWN.

16:52.079 --> 16:52.945
IT'S JUST A KNIFE--IT'S
THE KNIFE BEHIND THE NAPKIN.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.182
SORRY. I MEAN,
THAT REALLY FREAKED ME OUT.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.150
YEAH.
[chuckles]

16:57.184 --> 16:59.186
I LIKE RAMON,
BUT DO I LOVE RAMON?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.154
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
I ALWAYS PICTURED RICHIE

17:01.188 --> 17:02.522
WITH, LIKE, A KENNEDY,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

17:02.555 --> 17:05.092
ANYWAYS,
THAT WAS FUN LAST NIGHT.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.460
TONIGHT, ME, YOU,
RICHIE, AND RAMON,

17:07.494 --> 17:09.096
CHINESE CHECKER TOURNEY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:09.129 --> 17:11.231
UM, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.566
YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.806
[phone ringing]

17:19.839 --> 17:21.074
[sighs]
LANG.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.442
(Mindy)
HELLO? THIS IS
THE ZODIAC KILLER.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.244
I WANT TO TURN MYSELF IN.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.478
WHAT IS YOUR LOCATION?

17:25.512 --> 17:26.679
NO, I'M SO SORR--
I'M NOT--

17:26.713 --> 17:30.083
DON'T DO THAT!
YOU SOUNDED JUST LIKE HIM.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.485
HEY, I'M REALLY SORRY, OKAY?
I WANTED TO KNOW

17:32.519 --> 17:35.122
IF YOU WANTED TO SEE THE METEOR
SHOWER WITH ME TONIGHT.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.689
LOOK, MINDY,
I WAS WRONG WHEN I SAID

17:36.723 --> 17:39.092
YOU WAIT AROUND FOR GUYS
TO DO THINGS FOR YOU,

17:39.126 --> 17:41.294
BUT I THINK YOU ARE
WAITING FOR ONE GUY,

17:41.328 --> 17:43.396
AND I THINK
I MET HIM LAST NIGHT.

17:43.430 --> 17:47.800
OKAY, THE TRUTH IS THAT
I INVITED YOU OVER LAST NIGHT

17:47.834 --> 17:49.502
TO SEE IF DANNY AND I
COULD REALLY BE FRIENDS.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.372
SO YOU'RE USING ME? I'M JUST
A JAMOKE IN A HONEY TRAP?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.241
YES, I WAS TREATING YOU
LIKE A JAMOKE,

17:54.274 --> 17:55.642
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE
IS THAT YOU WERE

17:55.675 --> 17:57.344
THIS REALLY AWESOME JAMOKE--

17:57.377 --> 17:59.212
AND REALLY CUTE, BY THE WAY,
FOR YOUR AGE--

17:59.246 --> 18:01.281
WHO BELIEVED THAT I COULD
PUT OUT A FIRE BY MYSELF.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.116
I KNOW I SAID I WAS
SWEARING OFF ROMANCE,

18:03.150 --> 18:04.151
BUT YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.486
SO DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.288
JUST TO BE CLEAR,
IS THIS A DATE?

18:08.321 --> 18:10.323
IT IS A DATE. OH!
YOU CAN LET ME SHOOT YOUR GUN.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.825
YOU'RE A LITTLE NUT JOB.
I LIKE THAT, IT'S INTERESTING.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.694
COOL.
OH, BEFORE I FORGET,

18:14.727 --> 18:17.497
I WOULD LIKE TO PAY SOME
OUTSTANDING TICKETS THAT I HAVE.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.498
DO YOU HAVE A PEN?

18:18.531 --> 18:20.567
YEAH, SURE, GO AHEAD.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.670
MY "50 SHADES OF GREY"
CREDIT CARD NUMBER IS 2058--

18:23.703 --> 18:24.637
[phone clicks off]

18:24.671 --> 18:26.673
OH. OH, OKAY.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.542
[drill whirring]

18:29.576 --> 18:32.345
LAUREN, CAN I TALK TO YOU
OUTSIDE FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

18:32.379 --> 18:34.414
OH, SURE, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M OPERATING ON A BRAIN

18:34.447 --> 18:35.848
OR ANYTHING.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.151
[sighs] WARREN,
DON'T SCREW THIS UP AGAIN.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.252
[drill buzzing]

18:39.286 --> 18:42.155
YOU GOT THIS, WARREN.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.524
WHAT?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.594
LOOK, UH, ALL MY LIFE,
I'VE BEEN EATING HAMBURGERS,

18:47.627 --> 18:49.696
AND THEN I GOT TO TRY
THIS AMAZING PIECE OF STEAK,

18:49.729 --> 18:51.564
AND NOW, I CAN'T ENJOY
THESE SUPER SLUTTY HAMBURGERS--

18:51.598 --> 18:53.233
OKAY, STOP, STOP, STOP.
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING

18:53.266 --> 18:54.401
TO SAY A NICE THING,
SO MAYBE STOP

18:54.434 --> 18:55.935
REFERRING TO WOMEN AS MEAT.
YEAH.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.171
I HAVE TO GET BACK IN THERE.
WARREN'S A DRUNK.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.307
LOOK, YOU'RE SMART
AND YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL

19:00.340 --> 19:02.875
AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT,
AND I REALLY, REALLY BELIEVE

19:02.909 --> 19:04.644
THAT IF YOU JUST GIVE ME
ONE MORE CHANCE,

19:04.677 --> 19:06.446
SO HELP ME GOD,
I WILL MAKE YOU LIKE ME.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.449
[scoffs] OKAY.
ONE MORE CHANCE.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.450
YEAH.
OKAY.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.484
GREAT.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.952
(Danny)
HEY, NEIGHBOR.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.654
CAN I BORROW THAT DETERGENT
I BOUGHT FOR YOU?

19:14.687 --> 19:17.424
I LOVE THAT LAVENDER SCENT
ON MY UNDERSHIRTS.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.192
IT'S VERY SOOTHING.
YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.228
YOU GOT ANY--ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO WASH?

19:21.261 --> 19:22.329
WE CAN HANG OUT
WHILE WE WAIT.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.364
UH, NO.
ACTUALLY, I CAN'T.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.466
UM, GOING ON A DATE
TONIGHT.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.468
OH.
WELL, YOU LOOK REALLY NICE.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.371
YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH THAT COP GUY AGAIN?

19:31.404 --> 19:33.606
YEAH, HE'S TAKING ME TO SEE
MY FIRST METEOR SHOWER.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.776
YOUR FIRST METEOR SHOWER?
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE THAT STUFF.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.278
JUST LAST WEEK,
THERE WAS A FULL MOON,

19:38.311 --> 19:39.746
AND YOU WERE LIKE, "IF I WANT
TO SEE A WHITE CIRCLE,

19:39.779 --> 19:40.947
I CAN DRAW ONE
ON A PIECE OF PAPER."

19:40.980 --> 19:43.816
SO YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE
THAT STUFF.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.919
WELL, PEOPLE CHANGE, DANNY.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.893
OH, WAIT--WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:53.926 --> 19:56.429
UM--

19:56.463 --> 20:00.667
I WAS JUST GONNA...

20:00.700 --> 20:02.269
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST WANTED TO.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.704
YOU WANTED TO BECAUSE
I'M ABOUT TO GO ON A DATE.

20:04.737 --> 20:08.541
NO, THAT'S NOT WHY.
I JUST--I...I WANTED TO.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.343
WELL, THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU

20:10.377 --> 20:12.279
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER
WATCHING TV THE OTHER NIGHT?

20:12.312 --> 20:14.247
OR ANY NIGHT
FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS?

20:14.281 --> 20:15.582
WHY TONIGHT?

20:15.615 --> 20:17.250
THE MOMENT
JUST WASN'T RIGHT.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.286
AND THE MOMENT
IS ONLY RIGHT

20:19.319 --> 20:20.987
WHEN THERE'S ANOTHER GUY
IN THE PICTURE?

20:21.020 --> 20:23.523
YOU TURN IT ON,
YOU TURN IT OFF,

20:23.556 --> 20:25.725
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND
A MILLION TIMES,

20:25.758 --> 20:28.661
AND I'M NOT GONNA DO IT ANYMORE.
I GET TO DECIDE.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.997
[sighs]
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.032
HERE, TAKE THIS.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.534
I WAS JUST JOKING.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.668
YOU WEREN'T.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.570
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW,

20:37.604 --> 20:39.906
I CAN'T HELP THAT
YOU DIDN'T GET THE JOKE.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.310
I MEAN, IT WAS
ONE OF MY CLASSIC CASTELLANO--

20:44.911 --> 20:47.347
HAVE FUN TONIGHT.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.516
[door closing]

20:49.549 --> 20:52.819
YOU COLD? I GOT
A WINDBREAKER IN MY TRUNK,

20:52.852 --> 20:54.521
BUT I THINK IT'S GOT
A LITTLE BLOOD ON IT.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.290
NO, NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.658
OH, THERE!
I JUST SAW A METEOR.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.926
THAT'S ANOTHER PLANE.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.962
OH. WELL,
THIS IS FUN, YOU KNOW?

21:02.995 --> 21:04.964
I'M HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME
ON THIS DATE.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.667
ALTHOUGH,
ISN'T THIS KIND OF THING

21:07.700 --> 21:09.869
SUPPOSED TO BE MORE FUN
IF THERE WAS--

21:09.902 --> 21:13.440
I DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE, LIKE,
A LITTLE HIGH?

21:13.473 --> 21:15.007
I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.578
NO, NO, NO.
NO, OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.649
WINK?

21:22.682 --> 21:24.417
DON'T ARREST ME.
I'VE NEVER DONE DRUGS.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.752
IT'S JUST LOOKS COOL.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.919
SHH SHH SHH.
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.388
OH, THERE!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE!

21:28.421 --> 21:29.922
NO, ANOTHER PLANE.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.858
DAMN IT, CHARLIE,
WHAT THE HELL?

21:31.891 --> 21:33.860
(man)
GO TO BED.
