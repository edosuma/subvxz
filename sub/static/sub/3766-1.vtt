What? Where?

01:05.899 --> 01:06.934
Next door. In the window.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.606
I don't see anybody.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.612
I think the realtor gave
me the wrong code.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.048
Dad, this is a sign.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.850
I don't believe in signs.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.452
We should go back
to New York.

the difference between
a want and a need,

blow your mind.

I don't care how late it is,
I'm gonna call the realtor.

gave us the wrong combination.

try it one more time?

I've tried it about
a dozen times.
It won't open.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.839
Maybe 13's the charm.

it's gonna make...

02:36.290 --> 02:38.125
Oh, 13 gets such
a bad reputation,

a very lucky number for me.

You have the magic touch.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.200
(SIGHS) It's, um...

12:13.233 --> 12:14.768
(LAUGHS )Well, it's a mess.

12:14.802 --> 12:18.071
(CHUCKLES) You know,
I just came by to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.373
Bell, Book and Candle
is my shop.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.210
Oh, it seems we're
neighbors yet again.
(CHUCKLES)

12:24.211 --> 12:25.512
(CHIRPING)

12:26.880 --> 12:29.749
Oh, great, my first patient.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.318
Okay, come on, get out!
Out, out, out!

12:32.853 --> 12:34.054
Here, let me try.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.388
Uh-oh.
No, you're scaring him.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.623
Well... (SIGHS)

12:36.656 --> 12:38.391
What do you want me to do?
Give him an appointment?

12:38.425 --> 12:39.759
Put the broom down
for a second.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.196
Let him perch for a moment.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.102
(CONTINUES CHIRPING)

13:10.623 --> 13:12.792
(LAUGHS) Oh, come on.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.561
How'd you do that?

13:14.594 --> 13:15.728
Oh, I... I didn't do anything.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.364
He just needed
a little direction.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.601
We all do at one time
or another,
don't you think?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.603
Yeah, I do.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.040
And I should probably
call that handyman.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.408
I'm great with a scalpel,

13:28.441 --> 13:30.477
but, uh, not so much
with a hammer.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.545
Yes, you probably should.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.382
Yeah?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.584
That door may not be
your only problem.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.986
A little bird told me.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.387
(CHUCKLES)

13:55.602 --> 13:57.537
Hey, Matt, how are ya?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.172
Doc!

13:59.206 --> 14:01.241
I came to see how you
were settling into the place.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.976
Well, if Matt there
were a doctor,

14:03.010 --> 14:04.844
I'd be looking for a priest
to do the last rites.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.679
Yeah, sorry about that.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.348
No one's been
in this place for years.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.917
Which is exactly why
I thought I'd be busy

14:09.950 --> 14:12.019
from the minute
I opened the doors.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.386
But it's kind of slow.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.222
Yeah.

14:16.723 --> 14:17.925
What don't I know?

14:19.626 --> 14:23.230
To be honest,
nobody really liked the doctor
that used to be here.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.165
So I don't have an
established patient base,

14:25.198 --> 14:26.833
but now that I'm here...

14:26.866 --> 14:29.336
Well, when they stopped
going to him,
they started seeing Cassie.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.372
-My neighbor?
-Yeah.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.174
Yeah, allergies, cholesterol,

14:34.207 --> 14:37.644
minor sprains, anxiety,
you name it,
she's got us covered.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.446
Oh, it's amazing.
You go into that store,

14:39.479 --> 14:41.548
whatever you're looking for,
you'll find it.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.250
But she's not a doctor.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.885
No, but she helps people.
Everyone trusts her.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.864
(DOORBELL CHIMES)

14:57.897 --> 14:59.632
Hello, Stephanie.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.736
Okay, did you see him?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.038
I take it you met Sam.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.239
-Sam.
-(CHUCKLES)

15:06.273 --> 15:07.840
You say that
so matter-of-fact,

15:07.874 --> 15:09.977
like we got a new
postman or something.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.478
He is the most
eligible bachelor

15:11.511 --> 15:13.613
to hit Middleton
since my divorce.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.182
He has a son too, Nick.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.950
Who cares?

15:16.984 --> 15:21.221
I mean, it's "Dr. Good looking
and single" I care about.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.224
(SIGHS) He's McDreamy,
McSteamy...

15:24.257 --> 15:26.293
Oh, he's all the "Mc's"
and then some.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.460
I tried to book
an appointment,

15:27.494 --> 15:28.962
but he doesn't have
a phone yet.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.363
What? You're not sick.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.466
Oh yeah, I am.
I'm sick of being single.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.202
I am sick of going
to wedding showers,

15:35.235 --> 15:38.505
and I'm sick to death
of never having a date
for national holidays.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.174
(CHUCKLES) There's lots
of things to love about
living in a small town.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.110
The shallow dating pool
is not one of them.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.377
(CHUCKLES)

15:44.944 --> 15:46.213
So, have you met him?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.647
Yes, he's my new neighbor.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.251
Oh, well, you have
all the luck.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.420
Well, I don't think so.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.058
Look, I have
joined running clubs,

15:58.091 --> 16:00.360
skiing clubs,
rock climbing clubs.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.962
I've played golf,
tennis, racquetball,

16:02.996 --> 16:04.697
I go to every
sporting event there is.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.600
If there is a ball and a man,
I'm there.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.737
But you, they just
move in next door.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.405
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

16:12.439 --> 16:13.473
If what you have isn't luck,

16:13.506 --> 16:15.175
then I would like
some of whatever it is.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.409
Oh.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.180
Don't you ever,
you know, miss it?

16:21.948 --> 16:24.484
(SIGHS) You haven't dated
anyone since Jake.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.020
-He's been gone
for a while, now.
-No, I...

16:27.054 --> 16:29.222
I think it would be greedy
to want what I had with Jake

16:29.256 --> 16:30.523
twice in one lifetime.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.093
Brandon!

16:33.126 --> 16:34.394
-Hello there!
-BRANDON: Hey!

16:34.427 --> 16:35.462
How's the music business?

16:35.895 --> 16:37.730
Oh, hi, Steph.

16:37.764 --> 16:38.865
Next time your band's in town,

16:38.898 --> 16:40.733
take them by the bistro,
on me.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.402
-Oh, thanks.
-STEPHANIE: Yeah.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.504
Just one of the benefits
of owning your own restaurant.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.605
(CHUCKLES)

16:46.873 --> 16:49.076
-So, when's your next concert?
-Uh...

16:49.109 --> 16:51.311
Well, it's not
really definite yet.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.545
Well, I thought you told me...

16:52.579 --> 16:53.613
I should go.

16:57.917 --> 16:58.918
Bye.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.324
-What's with him?
-(DOORBELL CHIMES)

17:06.793 --> 17:09.496
There is no respect for band.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.132
Seniors get the best uniforms,
and we get what's left.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.833
-And it doesn't fit right.
-(CHUCKLES)

17:13.866 --> 17:15.902
I mean, seventh grade,
I almost lost my pants

17:15.935 --> 17:17.637
-during the halftime show.
-(LAUGHS) Oh, God.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.972
I mean you never see
a football player's pants
drop on the field.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.274
(LAUGHS) That's true.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.744
We're in here.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.850
Uh, we're supposed
to be in 302.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.785
This is
Mrs. Cavanaugh's class.

17:32.819 --> 17:33.886
Uh, wrong!

17:33.920 --> 17:35.722
See? Look, right there.
Mrs. Cavanaugh

17:35.755 --> 17:37.324
-(CHUCKLES)
-MRS. CAVANAUGH: English?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.592
Mrs. Cavanaugh?

17:39.626 --> 17:40.727
-Yeah.
-We're in here.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.062
The room changed
at the last minute.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.134
Lucky guess. (CHUCKLES)

17:47.167 --> 17:48.968
Remind me to
take you to Vegas.
(LAUGHS)

17:53.773 --> 17:56.443
-(BOTH GRUNTING)
-Ow! (CHUCKLES)

17:56.476 --> 17:58.845
Yeah. You've got a hard head.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.414
Oh!

18:01.448 --> 18:05.185
Yeah, no need to apologize,
but it was nice that you did.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.220
You hit me.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.858
I know Miss Russell
has somewhere to be,

18:11.891 --> 18:13.526
and I'm betting, Mr. Radford,

18:13.560 --> 18:15.895
that there is an
algebra teacher waiting
for your company.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.469
Ow.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.474
MARTHA: Dr. Radford?

18:28.575 --> 18:31.644
Mayor Martha Tinsdale.
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:31.678 --> 18:33.079
We've had a
lengthy correspondence,

18:33.112 --> 18:34.947
but I'm so grateful
to finally meet you.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.016
And I must say

18:37.049 --> 18:38.951
your profile picture
does not do you justice.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.787
(CHUCKLES)
Are you settling in?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.289
-Actually...
-I can't tell you

18:42.322 --> 18:44.157
how thrilled we are
that you're here.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.159
As you can see, Middleton
is a booming metropolis

18:46.193 --> 18:48.461
but the one thing missing
was our own doctor.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.663
Most people had to go
all the way to Blairsville.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.665
Yeah, about
that correspondence,

18:52.699 --> 18:53.900
you left a few things out.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.435
Whatever do you mean?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.870
I believe you used the terms
"state of the art"

18:57.904 --> 19:00.473
and "up to date" to describe
the office I'm renting.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.541
Well, isn't it?

19:02.475 --> 19:03.810
(SCOFFS) No!

19:03.843 --> 19:05.478
I'm going to have
to bring a lot of
new equipment in here,

19:05.512 --> 19:06.879
which I wasn't expecting.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.582
I'm sure you'll recover
any extra costs you endure,

19:09.616 --> 19:11.784
after all, you're
the only doctor here,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.052
and once I get the word out,

19:13.085 --> 19:15.288
you'll be turning
sick people away.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.025
I think the words
you're looking for
are "thank you".

19:20.460 --> 19:21.728
Thank you...

19:21.761 --> 19:24.431
For lying to me
about the condition
of the space I rented.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.300
Well, really, Ryan takes care
of all that property nonsense.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.136
No, no, I'm here
on much bigger business.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.071
The Ladies' Auxiliary
has you down

19:32.104 --> 19:34.507
to be our guest speaker
next week.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.509
12:00 sharp,
buffet lunch to follow.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.844
I do hope you're
not allergic to shrimp.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.246
Oh, and word to the wise,

19:39.279 --> 19:42.882
avoid Shelly Masters'
vegan fat-free muffins.

19:42.915 --> 19:43.983
You've got to be kidding.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.819
No, they're horrible!
And wear a tie.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.422
No.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.225
Uh, no?

19:52.259 --> 19:54.994
Yes, um, the opposite
of yes is no.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.095
No.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.997
But it's
the Ladies' Auxiliary!

19:58.030 --> 20:00.333
My Ladies' Auxiliary.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.502
Then, no thank you,

20:02.535 --> 20:05.472
I'll be busy fixing up
my "state of the art" office.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.780
-Hey!
-Hi.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.948
-Um...
-Thanks.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.719
So, how's your head?

20:19.752 --> 20:22.655
Okay? Um, you?

20:22.689 --> 20:25.157
Yeah. Oh, I'm Grace.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.294
-Uh, Nick.
-Nice to meet you.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.361
Officially.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.430
We're neighbors.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.765
-Oh. Uh, cool.
-(CHUCKLES)

20:33.900 --> 20:36.235
-Come in.
-Okay.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.238
So, if you have any questions
or anything...

20:39.272 --> 20:40.640
The only question I have is,

20:40.673 --> 20:42.241
what's the fastest way
out of town?

20:42.975 --> 20:44.711
Er, you just moved here.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.713
No offense but this town

20:47.213 --> 20:48.415
is no New York.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.217
(CHUCKLES)

20:51.250 --> 20:54.921
There is nothing
but offense in that statement.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.557
And Middleton
may not be New York City,

20:57.590 --> 21:00.693
but not every place
can be filled with crime,
poverty and overpopulation.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.439
George.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.815
(SIGHING)

21:25.051 --> 21:26.353
Hey there, everything okay?

21:27.253 --> 21:28.388
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

21:31.858 --> 21:33.292
Hey, hey, hey, you all right?

21:33.326 --> 21:34.627
-(SOFTLY) Yeah, I am.
-(DOOR CLOSES)

21:37.697 --> 21:38.998
George?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.911
Well, looks like
you just fainted.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.681
So, tell me, um...

21:55.382 --> 21:57.283
-George.
-George...

21:57.316 --> 21:59.819
Are you on any medication?

21:59.852 --> 22:01.187
What... What do you
have me taking?

22:01.220 --> 22:02.622
Uh, lots of herbs,

22:02.655 --> 22:05.057
vitamins, elixirs,
nothing that would have
made you faint.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.793
I am very careful
about interactions.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.629
Okay, well,
let's start with, uh,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.964
what you took
the last 24 hours.

22:11.998 --> 22:16.035
A mixture of ginseng,
licorice root, yohimbine.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.505
It's bark from
a west African tree.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.608
Um...

22:21.641 --> 22:23.175
Your blood pressure
is elevated.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.178
Wouldn't low blood pressure
make someone pass out?

22:26.212 --> 22:27.980
Well, sure, but...

22:29.449 --> 22:31.083
Have you ever been
diagnosed with hypertension?

22:31.651 --> 22:33.052
A while back, yeah.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.587
Well, see, whatever
your doctor gave you

22:34.621 --> 22:35.922
could be
what's making you dizzy.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.390
Sometimes medicines
have side effects.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.558
I know.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.993
The pills I was taking
to make me feel better

22:41.027 --> 22:42.361

to stop taking something
without consulting a doctor.

as the pills he gave me.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.237

22:51.270 --> 22:52.672

some stuff,

22:52.705 --> 22:55.908
and my blood pressure
has been fine for years.

to move here to Middleton

from the law... Oh!

isn't Radford.

-You were right.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.189
I was?

34:51.056 --> 34:52.624
I shouldn't have cut.
I got busted

34:52.658 --> 34:55.294
busted by both
the Vice-Principal
and my dad.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.562
Oh.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.497
Next time, maybe
I'll listen to you.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.466
Hmm.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.102
Hey, Nick, let's go.

35:04.136 --> 35:05.937
Uh, I'm... I'm good.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.375
But Nick, um...

35:09.408 --> 35:11.177
(CHUCKLES)
I'll... I'll see you later.

35:13.779 --> 35:14.780
All right.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.118
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

35:20.152 --> 35:23.054
You should know that Amber
isn't used to people
not doing what she wants.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.524
(CHUCKLES)
Back in New York,
I went to a school

35:25.557 --> 35:27.859
filled with Ambers.
I can handle her.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.795
Well, that should be
fun to watch.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.397
Yeah.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.499
So, I haven't seen
your dad around.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.833
Divorced?

35:36.202 --> 35:38.837
My dad passed away
a while ago.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.439
I'm so sorry to hear that.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.409
The whole town knows.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.876
He used to be Chief of Police.

35:45.677 --> 35:46.845
Sorry, I'm late.

35:46.878 --> 35:47.979
Hey.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.147
Is, uh...

35:49.181 --> 35:51.016
He walking home with us?

35:51.049 --> 35:52.918
I didn't know
you two were an us.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.253
We're not.

35:57.356 --> 36:00.392
Um, well, I don't
wanna go home, so...

36:00.426 --> 36:02.261
-All right. See ya.
-See ya.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.762
(WHISPERS) Come on.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.866
-Bye.
-Bye.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.547
-I knew it.
-CASSIE: Excuse me?

36:21.580 --> 36:23.148
I hit pay dirt.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.250
Sam.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.552
With no help from Ryan,
thank you very much.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.320
Apparently, there are
these websites

36:28.354 --> 36:30.889
where patients
can rate their doctors.

36:30.922 --> 36:34.693
"Dr. Radford
seemed very aloof."

36:34.726 --> 36:36.962
"Dr. Radford needs to work
on his bedside manner.

36:36.995 --> 36:39.365
"Not a very warm person."

36:39.398 --> 36:42.834
And there are five more,
all saying basically
the same thing.

36:47.873 --> 36:51.109
There are 512 comments,

36:51.142 --> 36:54.045
and you found
seven complaining
about his bedside manner?

36:54.079 --> 36:55.647
What about his competence
as a doctor?

36:55.681 --> 36:58.784
-Well, I... I...
-Johns Hopkins,
top of his class.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.752
On the board
of several hospitals.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.589
Published a textbook.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.224
Martha, if you ask me,
we got very lucky.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.693
He's a good doctor.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.028
Well, we'll just
have to agree...

37:10.696 --> 37:12.097
To disagree.

37:18.770 --> 37:19.771
Hey.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.073
Hi.

37:24.276 --> 37:27.513
Brandon won't answer
my calls or my texts.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.482
I feel bad.

37:30.516 --> 37:32.984
Don't worry,
he'll come to his senses.

37:33.018 --> 37:36.555
No, I mean I feel bad
that none of us supported him.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.391
Well, I can't support
something I don't believe in.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.294
But he believes in it,

37:42.328 --> 37:44.530
and he wants
to be a policeman.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.931
I can tell.

37:47.299 --> 37:50.502
I always thought that
it was music that he loved,

37:51.036 --> 37:52.638
but I was wrong.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.774
I think we were all wrong.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.976
We're not. He is.

38:01.246 --> 38:05.351
Your first job out of college
writing for that newspaper...

38:05.384 --> 38:07.653
They sent you
to the Middle East.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.755
It was right after Dad died,

38:09.788 --> 38:11.757
and I was so scared.

38:13.325 --> 38:15.160
We all were.

38:15.193 --> 38:16.462
Nothing happened to me.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.696
But it could have.

38:20.231 --> 38:23.101
But we all still supported
your decision.

38:24.002 --> 38:27.105
Me, Mom, Grandpa.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.075
Brandon.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.880
What are you trying to say?

38:36.047 --> 38:38.550
You know what I'm saying.

38:38.584 --> 38:39.851
You just don't wanna hear it.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.395
(KEYBOARD CLICKING)

38:49.428 --> 38:52.030
So you are my first patient.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.932
Well, I'm just happy
you could see me.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.267
So what brought you in today?

38:57.102 --> 38:58.136
You.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.507
What...
What symptom brought you in?

39:02.273 --> 39:05.711
-Well, I have migraines.
-Yes?

39:05.744 --> 39:08.414
Actually, "had"
is more accurate.
(CHUCKLES)

39:08.447 --> 39:09.615
How did you
get rid of them?

39:09.648 --> 39:11.617
Oh, uh,
Cassie gave me this oil

39:11.650 --> 39:13.051
to rub on my energy points.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.953
Works like a charm.
(CHUCKLES)

39:14.986 --> 39:17.055
So, that and yoga.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.724
Oh, and I gave up caffeine.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.993
So Cassie helped you?

39:22.027 --> 39:24.463
Oh, yeah, she helps
the whole town.
(CHUCKLES)

39:32.471 --> 39:33.939
-Hey! What's up?
-Hey.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.542
Uh, I just need your help
with a suspect.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.777
-You do? (CHUCKLES)
-Yeah.

39:45.316 --> 39:47.252
You wouldn't return my calls.

39:48.554 --> 39:51.122
Don't blame Derek,
I twisted his arm.

39:53.692 --> 39:54.993
Okay!

39:55.026 --> 39:58.163
I'm just gonna leave
you two here to talk.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.241
-Well, hello neighbor.
-Hello.

40:10.275 --> 40:12.744
-How's, uh, how's business?
-Slow.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.713
Huh. It'll pick up.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.381
Yeah, I don't think so.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.683
Why not?

40:17.716 --> 40:20.251
Well, it turns out
I've got competition
in this town.

40:20.285 --> 40:21.386
Who?

40:22.153 --> 40:23.922
-You.
-Me?

40:23.955 --> 40:26.224
Yeah, seems that even before
the other doctor was gone,

40:26.257 --> 40:27.693
people in town chose
to see you

40:27.726 --> 40:29.194
-for whatever ailed them.
-(SIGHS)

40:29.227 --> 40:30.596
Oh, Sam, I'm...

40:30.629 --> 40:33.064
I think what you
are doing is dangerous.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.668
I have never suggested
to anyone, anyone,
that they not see a doctor.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.303
I just offer alternatives.

40:38.336 --> 40:41.439
There are other ways,
alternative ways
to treat illness.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.942
To treat the patient
as a whole being.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.410
I've heard this
a million times.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.678
Well, have you
ever actually listened?

40:47.879 --> 40:50.081
I'm just saying
that popping pills

40:50.115 --> 40:52.751
doesn't always have to be
the first option.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.252
I can point to proven studies

40:54.285 --> 40:56.688
-that verify the results
from those pills.
-(SIGHS)

40:56.722 --> 40:59.390
I haven't seen many studies
on tree bark.

40:59.424 --> 41:01.426
A lot of the things
I suggest are preventative.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.128
I would be happy
to explain my methods...

41:03.161 --> 41:04.663
No! Thank you.

41:04.696 --> 41:06.632
I'm a doctor. You're...

41:08.399 --> 41:10.201
Well, not a doctor.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.978
