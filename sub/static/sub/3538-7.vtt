You know nothing about it.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.136
You don't go to Father Nunez.

31:18.220 --> 31:20.637
You go into the garage and
light candles to Santa Muerte.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.387
Santa Muerte's a holy angel--

31:22.470 --> 31:23.720
Sister Molly is just
as important to me

31:23.804 --> 31:25.053
as Santa Muerte is to you.

31:25.136 --> 31:28.095
The only difference is
Sister Molly is real.

31:32.261 --> 31:36.261
Well, I'm glad Josefina

39:51.595 --> 39:54.011
So we've got him
hidden for now.

39:54.095 --> 39:56.637
Because of this one rocket
he's working on?

39:56.720 --> 39:59.512
Point is,
with an engine big enough,

39:59.595 --> 40:02.011
the V-2 has a killer range.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.261
Old Adolf can press a button

40:04.345 --> 40:07.136
and, boom, there goes
part of London.

40:07.220 --> 40:09.595
You put that rocket
on a ship or submarine,

40:09.679 --> 40:13.053
and, boom, there goes part
of New York or Washington

40:13.136 --> 40:15.553
or God forbid Hollywood.

40:15.637 --> 40:17.679
Maybe not such a loss.

40:17.762 --> 40:19.303
But we need
to protect that kid,

40:19.387 --> 40:22.345
because if they find him
and get that rocket,

40:22.428 --> 40:25.428
ball game's called on account

40:27.679 --> 40:30.095
So we're following them?

40:34.762 --> 40:36.887
No.

40:38.261 --> 40:40.887
So what are we doing here?

40:47.095 --> 40:50.553
You know I have family
in Germany?

40:52.136 --> 40:54.053

40:56.095 --> 40:57.553
I met them once.

40:57.637 --> 41:02.053
They came here,
and I took them to the beach.

41:03.512 --> 41:06.720
They liked it.
Who doesn't like the beach?

41:06.804 --> 41:08.679

41:08.762 --> 41:10.637

41:12.136 --> 41:14.428
Anyway, second cousin,

41:14.512 --> 41:16.428
Manny's his name.

41:16.512 --> 41:19.220
Sweet guy.
Lives in the Rhineland.

41:19.303 --> 41:22.136
Practically in Belgium,
this is.

41:22.220 --> 41:24.261
Used to cross the border
to buy chocolates,

41:24.345 --> 41:26.178
because they were cheaper,
right?

41:26.261 --> 41:28.512
That's how much it was
almost Belgium.

41:29.679 --> 41:34.470
Sent me some chocolates once.
They were good.

41:34.553 --> 41:37.387
And cheap.

41:37.470 --> 41:40.387
So...

41:40.470 --> 41:44.428
two years ago,
Germany invades the Rhineland.

41:44.512 --> 41:47.845
You probably didn't know.
No one cared much.

41:49.929 --> 41:52.512
This wasn't so good
for Manny though.

41:55.553 --> 41:58.845
See, he was what they call
a degenerate.

42:00.553 --> 42:04.387
A Jew and a queer
in one fucked-up package.

42:08.053 --> 42:11.470
This they don't like.

42:11.553 --> 42:14.220
This they cannot have.

42:20.595 --> 42:23.261
So...

42:23.345 --> 42:27.387
they stuck him
on a meat hook.

42:29.553 --> 42:32.595
Took films of it
and sent it to Berlin

42:32.679 --> 42:35.387
so Adolf could have
a laugh, right?

42:38.261 --> 42:40.053
On this meat hook

42:40.136 --> 42:42.345
for hours, I guess.

42:46.261 --> 42:48.428
While they filmed it.

42:50.929 --> 42:53.762
This is who those people are.

47:24.929 --> 47:27.053
Weep, sister.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.804
Weep in darkness and forever.

47:52.512 --> 47:54.470
Why does she call you Coyote?

47:54.553 --> 47:57.512
It is my spirit guide.

47:57.595 --> 47:59.929
A hunter of the night.

48:00.011 --> 48:02.470
I could give you a better one.

48:02.553 --> 48:06.553
Why not raven
or bat or tigress?

48:08.178 --> 48:10.387
Why that sad, little dog?

48:10.470 --> 48:12.470
I am a dog.

48:12.553 --> 48:15.637
That is my strength.

48:15.720 --> 48:18.136
You are not welcome
in this home.

48:18.220 --> 48:20.053
This is the Lord's house.

48:22.303 --> 48:24.178
Oh, mamacita.

48:24.261 --> 48:26.595
Spare me the invocations
of a dusty faith

48:26.679 --> 48:28.845
in which you no longer believe.

48:28.929 --> 48:31.679
What is all this
but wicked idolatry?

48:31.762 --> 48:33.679
And you worship her.

48:36.387 --> 48:38.887
She's the icy finger of death,

48:38.970 --> 48:41.136
and yet you embrace her.

48:41.220 --> 48:43.887
I give mankind what it wants,
and you hate me.

48:43.970 --> 48:46.428
Now where's the sense
in that, Maria?

48:54.553 --> 48:57.512
Why do you only break
what others have built?

48:57.595 --> 48:59.679
All life comes from death.

48:59.762 --> 49:01.970
What do you know of life?

49:03.804 --> 49:05.345
You should choke on the word.

49:05.428 --> 49:08.345
I've created life.

49:08.428 --> 49:11.220
I nurtured it here
inside me.

49:13.470 --> 49:15.512
What have you done?

49:15.595 --> 49:18.053
You hunt, you kill.

49:18.136 --> 49:20.762
There is no life in it.

49:23.762 --> 49:27.553
You do know I can end
your suffering, yes?

49:27.637 --> 49:29.553
Bring your family back to you,

49:29.637 --> 49:33.303
all around the table
just like it was.

49:33.387 --> 49:36.553
I will not be tempted
by your lies.

49:36.637 --> 49:40.095
You're a hateful old cunt.

49:40.178 --> 49:43.095
Hollow words
from a broken heart.

49:43.178 --> 49:47.387
My sister has no ear for it,
but I do.

49:47.470 --> 49:51.512
I hear you cry out
for a savior.

49:51.595 --> 49:54.929
I can be that savior, Maria.

49:55.011 --> 49:56.637
If you love your family,

49:56.720 --> 49:58.929
if you would protect them,

49:59.011 --> 50:01.595
you will embrace me
with open arms.

50:01.679 --> 50:05.595
I...can bring you peace.

50:08.011 --> 50:10.595
My dear Maria.

50:10.679 --> 50:12.929
You've clawed through the mud,

50:13.011 --> 50:15.387
you've climbed hills
with a broken back,

50:15.470 --> 50:19.470
all to give your family
a better life.

50:19.553 --> 50:23.720
Now you need to rest.

50:23.804 --> 50:26.595
Yes.

50:26.679 --> 50:29.929
My time for rest is coming.

50:30.011 --> 50:32.220
But not yet.

50:33.970 --> 50:38.053
My family may be at the center
of this chess game of yours.

50:39.637 --> 50:42.178
But we not pawns.

50:42.261 --> 50:46.136
We are kings and queens.

50:46.220 --> 50:50.303
And the blood of the Aztecs
runs through us.

50:50.387 --> 50:54.970
The soldiers of the Revolución
walk beside us.

50:55.053 --> 50:58.595
And as long as I draw breath

50:58.679 --> 51:01.011
from my lungs,

51:01.095 --> 51:04.679
I will claw through mud,

51:04.762 --> 51:07.053
I will climb hills,

51:07.136 --> 51:10.178
and I will fight you
to the end of days.

51:13.095 --> 51:15.178
In the name of my children,

51:15.261 --> 51:18.220
whom God knit together
in my womb,

51:18.303 --> 51:21.512
I banish you from this place.
