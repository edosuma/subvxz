10:05.909 --> 10:07.476
A good 60% of the cut flowers

10:07.519 --> 10:09.347
that come into the U.S.
come from Colombia.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.479
Plane-loads of 'em, every day.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.480
What, you think
they're smuggling

10:11.523 --> 10:12.481
the drugs in with
the flowers?

10:12.524 --> 10:14.004
Makes sense,
given their style.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.702
I mean, the bikes,
automatic weapons.

10:15.745 --> 10:18.661
It's reminiscent of old
South American narco hit squads.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.837
Ever since the Mexican cartels
took over the cocaine trade,

10:20.881 --> 10:23.100
the Colombians have been looking
for a way back in.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.624
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Luca, that one right there.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.364
Him. He was there
this morning.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.236
STREET:
You sure?
100%.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.281
He was there. He was watching
just before it all went down.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.674
LUCA:
Well, he's wearing
general's bars,

10:31.718 --> 10:33.154
but there's no name
on his uniform.

10:33.197 --> 10:35.286
Then let's figure out
who the hell this guy is.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.551
Dude, what's going on?

10:39.595 --> 10:42.163
It's not like you to be late,
especially on an all-hands day.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.339
I had to stop by the
Professional Standards Bureau

10:44.382 --> 10:45.645
on the way in.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.690
Wh-Why? What's going on?

10:47.734 --> 10:50.127
Last night, I accidentally ate
some pot gummies.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.347
Yeah, they were Bonnie's.
Actually, a friend of hers.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.566
Didn't realize what it was
until it was too late.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.525
I'm not high or anything.
I slept 'em off.

10:56.568 --> 10:57.744
You tell Hondo yet?

10:57.787 --> 10:59.310
Yeah, him and Hicks.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.051
About as cool
as they could be, I guess,

11:01.095 --> 11:02.662
given the circumstances.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.489
What, so now you're
under investigation?

11:04.533 --> 11:07.362
Yeah, I had to provide a
urine sample, blood, all of it.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.580
Now Standards Bureau's
sending a rep.

11:08.624 --> 11:11.235
I got to sit down
for an interview.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.411
Hey, you know what kind
of questions they're gonna ask?

11:13.455 --> 11:14.804
What, 'cause I'm the guy
that everyone assumes

11:14.848 --> 11:16.458
is always in front of
the Standards Bureau?

11:16.501 --> 11:18.373
Just tell me what you know.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.592
All right. From
what I've heard--

11:20.636 --> 11:23.465
and this is pure gossip,
mind you-- they get personal.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.033
You should be fine as long as
you don't take it that way.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.949
[sighs]
Right. I don't know
how to feel.

11:28.992 --> 11:31.473
Thing is, I love Bonnie, but...

11:31.516 --> 11:32.996
Part of you wonders about
her thinking on this?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.694
Take it from someone

11:34.737 --> 11:37.174
whose judgment gets
questioned occasionally.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.567
Cut her some slack.

11:38.610 --> 11:39.873
I don't know.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.744
You know, I haven't
introduced her to my mother,

11:41.788 --> 11:43.615
any of my family.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.617
Maybe there's
an unconscious reason for that.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.753
[Chris asks question in Spanish]

11:50.797 --> 11:52.233
MAN:
I'm sorry. No.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.713
MAN 2:
Sorry. Don't
know anything.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.671
Hey, can I talk to you a second?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.020
I already spoke
to the police.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.456
Yeah, but I'm sure
the officer you talked to

11:58.500 --> 12:00.545
didn't ask about this guy.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.722
He was there right before
the shooting started.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.593
You know him,
don't you?
Look, I really
can't help you.

12:04.636 --> 12:05.855
Hey, I don't want
to play this card,

12:05.899 --> 12:07.291
but I kind of
saved your life today.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.512
Who is this guy?

12:10.555 --> 12:13.776
His name is Emiliano Murido.He has you all

12:13.820 --> 12:16.736
importing his drugs with
your flowers, doesn't he?We have no choice.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.738
He can hurt our families
back home in Colombia.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.696
So the shooting today--
you think he ordered it?Yeah.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.480
Nobody wants to be involved
in Murido's drugs.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.743
We just want
to sell our flowers.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.483
He must have found out
some of us

12:25.527 --> 12:26.746
were talking
about going to the police.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.617
So this is
Murido's way of

12:28.660 --> 12:30.401
keeping you all quiet?
Kill some and scare the others?

12:30.445 --> 12:32.403
We just want to make
an honest living.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.754
That's why we came
to America, not for this.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.929
What else can you
tell us about him?

12:39.541 --> 12:41.673
Got home from my shift
around 0200.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.937
The gummy worms in question
were on the counter.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.590
I ate four or five.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.027
I went to sleep within the hour.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.638
It wasn't till this morning,

12:49.681 --> 12:51.161
after I woke up, that I learned

12:51.205 --> 12:53.163
the gummy worms contained THC.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.730
At that point,
I headed directly

12:54.774 --> 12:56.819
to the Standards Bureau
as dictated by protocol.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.734
You said the gummies belonged
to your girlfriend?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.040
Uh, yeah.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.215
I need her name.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.607
Uh... Bonnie.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.392
Bonnie Lonsdale.

13:04.435 --> 13:05.741
Hey, it's not
really her fault.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.047
All right, she would've
put them away,

13:07.090 --> 13:09.745
but she had a little
too much wine last night.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.617
It-it's not like
she drinks a lot.

13:12.661 --> 13:13.967
You know, she had a friend over,

13:14.010 --> 13:15.969
and they hadn't seen each other
for a while.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.622
How would you describe your
relationship with Ms. Lonsdale?

13:17.666 --> 13:18.885
Is it serious?

13:18.928 --> 13:21.888
Is that really relevant
to the investigation?

13:21.931 --> 13:23.672
Part of being a cop,
particularly a SWAT officer,

13:23.715 --> 13:25.630
is making the right choices,
on and off the job.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.807
We're gonna need
your girlfriend to come down,

13:27.850 --> 13:29.634
give us a statement.

13:29.678 --> 13:30.853
She might not be cool with that.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.072
Is she cool with us

13:32.115 --> 13:33.682
concluding our investigation

13:33.725 --> 13:34.988
without us
hearing her testimony?

13:35.031 --> 13:37.033
Uh...

13:38.295 --> 13:39.819
This guy who was
always trying

13:39.862 --> 13:41.908
to get in my pants in
college is with the DEA now,

13:41.951 --> 13:43.692
and occasionally, I try
to fish for a little info,

13:43.735 --> 13:45.476
and apparently, he still
can't resist my charms.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.217
Got us a lead on our guy.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.654
General Emiliano Murido.

13:49.698 --> 13:52.875
He's a FARC rebel leader until
they signed a peace agreement

13:52.919 --> 13:54.659
with the Colombian
government in 2016.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.096
FARC was supposed
to represent the people,

13:56.139 --> 13:57.619
but according to this,
he's responsible

13:57.662 --> 13:59.012
for hundreds
of extrajudicial killings.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.709
Turns out he was
a very bad boy,

14:00.752 --> 14:01.928
in charge of their
extortion rings,

14:01.971 --> 14:03.494
kidnappings
and bombings.

14:03.538 --> 14:04.887
Not to mention
the drug trafficking operation

14:04.931 --> 14:06.758
that funded all of it.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.718
LYNCH:
Looks like he went off the grid
right after the peace treaty.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.763
I'm cuddling up with RHD and
Narcotics to find his network

14:11.807 --> 14:13.722
and see what his ground
game here looks like.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.290
BOLO out on Murido just got
a bead on the Bentley he drives.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.770
Just got spotted outside
a café on Larchmont.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.381
Pay this dirtbag a visit.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.165
We know he's nasty.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.819
Be safe.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
Interesting lady.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.736
Guess she likes to say
what's on her mind.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.564
She could spare me some of it.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.656
[indistinct chatter]

14:45.841 --> 14:48.583
Emiliano Murido.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.019
LAPD SWAT.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.803
We're gonna need you
to come answer some questions

14:51.847 --> 14:54.154
about the Flower Outlet
earlier today.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.895
I'm very busy.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.635
I saw you there
before your shooters arrived.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.246
Think you got a lot
to answer for.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.248
Perhaps you are
making a mistake.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.119
Somehow, I doubt that.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.951
You're coming with us,
one way or another.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.782
If you wouldn't mind,
call this number first.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.656
Who's gonna pick up?

15:18.700 --> 15:20.745
Only one way to find out.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.835
I got a better idea.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.794
Why don't you make
the call yourself

15:25.837 --> 15:27.970
from our place. Get up.

15:40.765 --> 15:43.377
[distant siren wailing]

15:45.205 --> 15:46.728
[Deacon sighs]

15:46.771 --> 15:49.078
Hondo, Deacon,
this is Agent Devereaux,

15:49.122 --> 15:50.775
CIA.
Sergeants.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.386
What's the CIA got to do
with any of this?

15:52.429 --> 15:54.083
They need you
to release General Murido.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.693
Come again,
Lieutenant?You heard me.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.260
You don't have to like it,

15:57.304 --> 15:59.436
but you do have
to cut him loose.

16:14.321 --> 16:15.931
We've got reason to believe
that Murido's running

16:15.975 --> 16:17.802
a cocaine operation in L.A.And ordered the hit

16:17.846 --> 16:19.804
at the Flower Outlet today. Four
dead vendors, six more wounded.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.111
And what proof do you have that
Murido played a part in that?Well, I spoke

16:22.155 --> 16:24.374
to one of the vendors
forced to import Murido's drugs.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.897
He stated that Murido
orchestrated the shooting

16:25.941 --> 16:27.769
as a warning
not to go to police.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.075
Well, that's conjecture at best.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.990
Anyone back that story up?HONDO: He was there.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.600
We caught him on camera
before the shooting started.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.558
So all you've really got
is footage of Murido shopping

16:34.602 --> 16:35.951
for flowers.HICKS: Come on.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.648
You really think
this is a coincidence?

16:37.692 --> 16:40.042
What's he giving you that's
worth that kind of protection?

16:40.086 --> 16:41.261
That's privileged
information.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.046
Look, Murido is no angel.
We know that.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.396
But because of his background,
he's able to give us

16:46.440 --> 16:48.268
valuable intel along Colombia's
border with Venezuela,

16:48.311 --> 16:50.313
a government hostile
to our own.LYNCH: You're saying

16:50.357 --> 16:52.402
Murido could help save lives
in that part of the world.

16:52.446 --> 16:56.058
And in exchange, we allow him
a certain degree of immunity

16:56.102 --> 16:57.886
and provide medical treatment
for a viral condition he has.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.062
But there are limits, of course.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.804
I will talk to him, make sure
we have him under control.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.893
So you're just gonna turn a
blind eye to his drug operation?

17:04.936 --> 17:07.026
And the shootout
this morning?I'd need more proof

17:07.069 --> 17:08.288
of his guilt
before I just turn him over

17:08.331 --> 17:09.854
and abandon the greater good.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.248
Greater good? You didn't
see those people killed.

17:12.292 --> 17:15.904
Your priorities are 4,000 miles
away on some other continent.

17:15.947 --> 17:19.038
We are worried about the people
here in Los Angeles.

17:20.561 --> 17:22.345
Murido's not to be touched,
understood?

17:27.785 --> 17:29.265
Mess with him again,

17:29.309 --> 17:31.702
repercussions will fall
on you, Lieutenant Lynch.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.753
[Lynch sighs]

17:39.971 --> 17:42.148
That wasn't a fight
we were gonna win.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.504
Yo, Hondo.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.593
D.

17:52.636 --> 17:53.855
Everything all right?

17:53.898 --> 17:55.509
Yeah.
Let's walk.

17:55.552 --> 17:58.207
You know, your pops wanted me to
give the car a spin, you know,

17:58.251 --> 17:59.513
test out the
new carburetor.

17:59.556 --> 18:00.992
So I thought I'd
just drive by here

18:01.036 --> 18:02.994
since it's not that far.Wait. Hold up. Hold up.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.040
My pops is already letting you
drive the six-four?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.302
I mean, damn,
it took me years

18:06.346 --> 18:07.999
before he even
let me wash that ride.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.045
Yeah, I guess I just
got it like that, yeah.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.178
Hey.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.005
What's really going on with you?

18:15.877 --> 18:18.009
[sighs]
I-I was gonna tell you sooner,

18:18.053 --> 18:19.968
but your pops told me
not to say anything.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.188
But straight up,
I feel like he's sick.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.667
Like, real, real sick.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.365
I've been seeing him
coughing up blood lately.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.237
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What?I seen it happen twice now.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.239
The first time it happened,
he said it was "chest pepper,"

18:30.283 --> 18:32.111
and I don't know
what that means.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.982
I guess it's old-school
for heartburn or something.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.853
But I know
it's not that.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.986
And the second time it happened,
I offered to call 911,

18:38.029 --> 18:40.162
but he just said
he'll deal with it.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.033
All right, Darryl.
It's all right.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.079
Thank you for telling me.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.168
I'll talk to him.All right.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.304
BONNIE:
Please don't be tough
on Victor. He didn't know.

18:51.347 --> 18:54.089
This was all my fault.
I am so sorry.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.004
So these pot gummies
belonged to you?

18:56.047 --> 18:57.658
No. My friend
brought them over.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.139
Please state your friend's name.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.142
That's necessary?

19:03.185 --> 19:05.056
Do you know if she purchased
the gummies legally?

19:05.100 --> 19:06.536
I think so.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.148
Please tell me she's not

19:09.191 --> 19:10.932
going to get
in trouble for this, too.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.239
No. I'm just trying
to keep the facts straight.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.849
How often do you
consume edibles?

19:18.418 --> 19:20.985
Uh... maybe once a week.

19:21.029 --> 19:24.032
It was a terrible mistake.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.947
I love Victor,
and I don't want him getting

19:25.990 --> 19:27.514
into any trouble
for something that I did.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.255
I can understand that.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.561
Is there anything else the
Standards Bureau needs from us?

19:31.605 --> 19:33.215
Just patience as we deliberate.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.049
[indistinct chatter]

19:41.092 --> 19:43.443
I meant everything
that I said in there.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.488
I know how important
SWAT is to you.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.751
I should have explained all
the rules to you before,

19:47.795 --> 19:49.231
emphasized what
was important,

19:49.275 --> 19:50.972
stopped this
from getting here.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.975
Thanks, but that's you trying
to take responsibility,

19:54.018 --> 19:55.759
make me feel better.

19:55.803 --> 19:58.197
Look, I know how much
this bothers you.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.416
I just wish you showed
better judgment.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.246
Look, if we're
gonna be together,

20:04.290 --> 20:05.682
what you do reflects
on me, and vice-versa.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.206
There are some things

20:07.249 --> 20:08.903
that I can't do with you
'cause of this job.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.948
But I also know it's
not fair to ask you

20:10.992 --> 20:14.256
to be somebody different than
who you are, so I don't know.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.780
You're scaring me right now.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.260
Are you saying that you...?

20:18.304 --> 20:20.306
I don't know
what I'm saying.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.917
I'll be right back.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.962
I'm just gonna
use the bathroom.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.617
[sighs]

20:27.661 --> 20:30.272
Hondo, Deacon found an alias
Murido used back in Colombia.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.926
We cross-checked with the
L.A. County Recorder's Office.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.971
One of the names was used to
get a business license here.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.625
It's a flower storage
warehouse in South Gate

20:35.669 --> 20:38.280
where Murido's vendors go to
get their weekly flower supply.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.195
Which means it's probably
where he stores his drugs.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.631
Okay, hold up.
You heard the CIA.

20:41.675 --> 20:42.806
Murido's untouchable.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.504
He might be.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.201
But what I heard is

20:46.245 --> 20:48.203
they wouldn't do anything
without more proof.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.076
But as far as I'm concerned,
his drug business is fair game.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.297
And if he's swept up
in it, so be it.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.604
We gonna tell Lynch about this?

20:57.647 --> 20:59.258
No.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.260
Roger that.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.263
Let's roll.

21:10.181 --> 21:11.748
Hondo, our undercover
is in the warehouse.

21:11.792 --> 21:14.185
[indistinct,

You got to feel for Tan, huh?

21:21.976 --> 21:24.457
You think relationships
only get in the way of this job?Depends.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.329
For me, job's only gotten in
the way of my relationships.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.679
[crowd chatter]

21:34.902 --> 21:37.339
Okay, visual confirmation
on the drugs.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.345
I got six armed guards--
two each on the north and south.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.216
The other two
walking the center aisle.

Anyone want to guess
the street value?DEACON: Call Narcotics.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.308
Have them check every box,
all the pallets.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.920
Shut this place down.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.410
Should I fake some niceties

22:48.454 --> 22:50.456
or just skip straight
to being hopping mad?

22:50.499 --> 22:52.283
Why don't you give it
to me straight?

22:52.327 --> 22:54.503
I just got off the phone
with Agent Devereaux

22:54.547 --> 22:56.287
expressing the CIA's
extreme displeasure.

22:56.331 --> 22:58.986
It was all I could do to
keep him from calling the mayor.

22:59.029 --> 23:00.379
Crisis averted, then.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.293
You went behind my back.I'm sorry.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.208
I'm not operating
under the impression

23:04.252 --> 23:06.341
that I need to clear any
of SWAT's actions with you.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.126
Murido was explicitly
off limits.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.563
We didn't target Murido.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.391
We did, however, disrupt

23:12.434 --> 23:14.349
a major cocaine
smuggling operation,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.482
which I'm pretty sure is
well within our purview.

23:17.526 --> 23:18.745
That's very clever.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.140
I'm sure you're quite smitten

23:23.184 --> 23:25.012
with what you've just managed
to pull off here,

23:25.055 --> 23:26.970
but you are going out
on a limb, Commander.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.885
And I hope it works out,
I really do,

23:28.929 --> 23:31.279
but if it doesn't,
I won't have your back.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.847
Didn't think you would.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.589
Okay.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.376
[door closes]

23:45.728 --> 23:47.730
You've been keeping
your phone on you?

23:47.774 --> 23:50.211
I put it aside
to work on my car.

23:50.254 --> 23:51.995
I don't like distractions.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.650
It's the kind of dedication
my baby deserves. [chuckles]

23:55.695 --> 23:57.218
I called you
from work today.

23:57.261 --> 23:59.002
Everything okay?

23:59.046 --> 24:00.743
You tell me.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.659
Appears to be.Pop,

24:03.703 --> 24:05.444
I hear you've been
coughing up blood.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.316
You've been doing a good
job of hiding that from me.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.231
Never figured that boy
to be a damn snitch.

24:10.274 --> 24:11.841
Got to mind his own business.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.147
This ain't about Darryl, Pop.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.366
It's about your health, man.

24:15.410 --> 24:18.282
I've seen your coughing fits,
and they're getting worse.

24:18.326 --> 24:20.284
Coughing fits ain't
never killed no one.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.286
Pop? Pop?What?!

24:22.330 --> 24:24.811
What if it's a symptom
of something more dangerous?

24:24.854 --> 24:27.291
Don't you know about
mind your own store?

24:27.335 --> 24:29.293
You're always trying
to save everyone.

24:29.337 --> 24:32.122
You're gonna run yourself in
the ground sooner or later.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.907
Try worrying about
yourself, son.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.822
Don't do that. Don't you try
and make this about me.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.345
Look, I'm an old man.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.652
And one day, you're
gonna understand

24:39.695 --> 24:42.002
that the future
ain't always bright.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.701
Is that why you decided
to come back home?

24:45.745 --> 24:47.834
Because you wanted
to try and fix the past,

24:47.877 --> 24:49.749
make up for your mistakes
while you still can?

24:49.792 --> 24:51.620
I've made my peace
with all of that.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.318
Well, some of us haven't.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.540
You want to put
your mind at ease?

24:58.584 --> 25:00.890
You've came to
the wrong place.

able to sleep tonight.

25:21.128 --> 25:25.349
Oh, well, not that I have
anything to compare it to...

25:27.308 --> 25:30.572
...but I think they're handling
the situation pretty well,

25:30.616 --> 25:33.140
considering the circumstances.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.316
Maybe helps that Daddy's a cop.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.449
They saw him come
to the rescue, get the bad guy.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.277
They shouldn't have seen
any of that.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.543
You know, Samuel told his friend
that he wasn't afraid,

25:44.586 --> 25:47.067
that he knew
his dad would save the day.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.983
What did you think?

25:50.026 --> 25:53.421
That you were gonna
keep your promise to me.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.036
LILA:
Can I sleep
with you guys?

26:00.080 --> 26:02.517
Of course you can,
sweetheart. Come on.Yup.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.302
Come on.

Hey.Looks like it's you
and me and Mommy.

Hey, kids,

27:18.201 --> 27:21.335
you get hungry, I got
some shucos and tepache.

27:21.378 --> 27:22.989
Man, this stuff is
yum, yum, yum, yum.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.730
You're gonna
love it, man.

27:24.773 --> 27:28.037
And I brought some sandwiches
and snacks for you and the kids.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.433
I really appreciate you guys
coming in while off duty.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.957
I mean, you didn't
have to do it.Are you kidding me, Deac?

27:35.001 --> 27:37.264
An attack on one of us
is an attack on all of us.

27:37.307 --> 27:38.352
Anything you need.

27:38.395 --> 27:39.832
It's just a family thing.Yeah, man.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.485
Hey.

That is yums. Whoa!

27:51.365 --> 27:53.584
Hey. How you holding up?

27:53.628 --> 27:55.151
This time? Not fine.

27:55.195 --> 27:57.066
Murido ordered this
because of our bust.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.678
You know that.I do, and we're
gonna go after him.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.331
Not if Lynch
gets in the way.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.986
And what if the CIA
keeps protecting him?

28:06.336 --> 28:08.512
You better choose your next
words carefully, Devereaux.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.689
Sergeant, I heard about
what happened at your home.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.082
I can't imagine
what you must be going through.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.650
Just relieved that you
and your family were unharmed.They were Murido's men.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.565
They were targeting my wife
and my children as payback.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.523
I get that you're pissed.
I would be, too.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.221
But if this is payback
like you're saying,

28:21.264 --> 28:23.353
wasn't it set in motion
by messing with their boss,

28:23.397 --> 28:24.877
who we told you was off-limits?

28:24.920 --> 28:27.270
Okay, that right there
does not sound like an apology.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.750
I don't know what
I would be apologizing for.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.926
We gave you an order,
you ignored it,

28:30.970 --> 28:32.362
there were consequences.Deac!

28:32.406 --> 28:33.146
Get off!
Deacon!

28:33.189 --> 28:34.277
Get off!Deacon! Deac!

28:34.321 --> 28:35.539
Get him off!Deacon, that's enough.

28:35.583 --> 28:36.889
That's enough, man.

28:36.932 --> 28:39.892
Murido made a run
at Deacon's family.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.763
Now, you got to explain how
you're gonna make it right.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.765
And he will.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.549
Agent Devereaux,

28:45.593 --> 28:47.856
why don't the three of us
talk privately in my office?

28:47.900 --> 28:50.163
Where I come from,
street cops don't touch agents.

28:50.206 --> 28:53.775
Where I come from, people with
badges don't protect killers.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.350
[door opens, closes]

29:03.393 --> 29:06.005
So this comes down to
Lynch and the CIA?

29:06.048 --> 29:07.833
That's just great.

29:12.185 --> 29:13.795
My sergeant and his kids
are spending

29:13.839 --> 29:15.057
the night here
under our protection.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.233
The line's been crossed.
We need to deal

29:17.277 --> 29:19.192
with the fact that
your asset had a cop

29:19.235 --> 29:20.846
and his family attacked
in their own home.

29:20.889 --> 29:22.717
We don't have
definitive proof of that.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.066
And if you did, what
would you do to Murido?

29:24.110 --> 29:25.894
Give him a good talking-to?

29:25.938 --> 29:28.201
I'm trying to balance
two competing interests here.

29:28.244 --> 29:30.812
[scoffs]How would you like a
story in the L.A. Times

29:30.856 --> 29:33.162
about the CIA doing business
with a South American drug lord?

29:33.206 --> 29:34.816
Wouldn't be the
first time you fellas

29:34.860 --> 29:36.078
tried dirty tricks
in this city.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.993
Freeway Rick, Iran Contra.

29:38.037 --> 29:40.430
You think a reporter might
be interested in that story?

29:40.474 --> 29:41.605
You know
I can't give you Murido.

29:41.649 --> 29:42.911
Then give us something else.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.870
[sighs]

29:50.353 --> 29:52.834
Brave kids.
You taught 'em well.

29:52.878 --> 29:55.184
No, no. Annie did that.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.838
[Victoria coos]

29:56.882 --> 30:00.015
I promised her I'd always
keep our family safe.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.843
What am I doing if I
can't keep that promise?

30:01.887 --> 30:03.845
Well, it looks like
you lived up to it to me.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.586
[Victoria fusses]

30:06.674 --> 30:08.589
[sighs]
Annie?

30:11.070 --> 30:12.854
Bonnie.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.290
I heard what happened.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.466
Oh, I can't believe it.Mm.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.860
I mean, how do you even
deal with all of this?

30:18.904 --> 30:20.862
Oh, I'm just grateful
everyone's okay.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.777
I heard about
why you're here.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.779
Mm. I really screwed up.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.215
Hey, it's not easy.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.000
I mean, I-I have
to make sure that

30:28.043 --> 30:31.873
my kids' poppy seed bagels don't
ever get anywhere near David's.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.006
Can't test positive for opiates.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.704
Hmm.
You know,
being with a cop,

30:36.747 --> 30:40.099
especially a SWAT officer--
it's just... different.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.884
I envy what you
and Deacon have.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.931
ANNIE:
Oh, you got to know
what you're getting into.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.541
But if you're with a man
that you love,

30:47.584 --> 30:50.979
there is no bigger reward
than a SWAT family.

30:52.807 --> 30:53.895
Just had your
house shot up.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.462
Annie still seems
unshakeable.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.594
Guessing she was built
to be a cop's wife.

30:57.638 --> 30:58.987
No. Not in
the beginning.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.336
No, took time
and some convincing

31:00.380 --> 31:02.904
that I was someone
worth betting on,

31:02.948 --> 31:04.427
that all the late nights
and the worrying

31:04.471 --> 31:05.689
was gonna be worth it.

31:05.733 --> 31:08.562
I just hope it still is for her.

31:08.605 --> 31:11.043
I hadn't thought of it
that way before.

31:13.088 --> 31:14.698
We ask too much of them.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.967
HONDO:
Pop, I've been trying
to reach you, man,

31:22.010 --> 31:24.012
but, listen, something's going
on with Deacon and his family

31:24.056 --> 31:26.406
that I got to look into,
but this is my third voice mail.

31:26.449 --> 31:28.364
I know you're trying to duck me.
Now, stop it.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.931
Just call me back.Hondo.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.933
Pop, we need to talk.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.327
Tell us we got the green light
to go after Murido.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.632
Is the CIA handing him over?

31:35.676 --> 31:37.896
Not exactly.This is so screwed up.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.941
Commander, we can't keep
carrying the Agency's water,

31:39.985 --> 31:42.248
not with Deacon's house getting
shot up with his kids inside.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.989
Hondo, dial it down
for a second.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.991
They won't give up Murido,
because they can't.

31:46.034 --> 31:49.037
But we got them to give us the
final cog of his drug business.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.691
Murido's got
an inside guy at customs

31:50.734 --> 31:52.954
who lets his cocaine
slip through. We flip him,

31:52.998 --> 31:55.304
should allow us to bring
the operation down for good.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.698
First,
we pick up our guy.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.483
Name is Howard McReady.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.355
Let's bring him in.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.361
I don't want to go to prison.

32:08.404 --> 32:11.103
Murido threatened
to kill me and my family.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.321
What choice did he give me?

32:12.365 --> 32:13.801
The easy choice was
to take his payoffs.

32:13.844 --> 32:14.889
That was a bad deal.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.977
Should've come to us first.

32:16.021 --> 32:16.978
We would've made you
a better one.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.240
You guys have guns and badges.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.894
You can protect yourselves.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.983
What can I do
against a guy like that?

32:22.027 --> 32:24.768
Well, we can keep you safe
from this point on,

32:24.812 --> 32:26.945
but you're gonna tell us
about every shipment

32:26.988 --> 32:28.990
that you let come
through customs for him.

32:34.561 --> 32:36.650
What about the one
coming in tonight?

32:38.173 --> 32:40.959
It's Murido's biggest
delivery from Bogotá.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.048
What time is it getting in?Next couple hours.

32:43.091 --> 32:45.485
I heard the warehouse
in South Gate got raided.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.269
Can't take his supply there
no more.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.575
He's gonna need someplace new.

32:48.618 --> 32:49.880
Any bright ideas where?I won't know

32:49.924 --> 32:51.360
until I see him
at customs tonight,

32:51.404 --> 32:53.014
but if I'm not there,
he's gonna know something's up,

32:53.058 --> 32:55.712
get spooked.
Okay.

32:55.756 --> 32:59.020
We need to find him
some clothes.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.458
You're working tonight, for us.

33:13.078 --> 33:16.124
Guess I'll see you
back at home?
Yeah.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.604
Pick you up something
on the way?

33:17.647 --> 33:19.214
I'm not really hungry.

33:19.258 --> 33:23.001
Look, if being with you
means stopping the edibles,

33:23.044 --> 33:24.350
I am done with them.

33:24.393 --> 33:27.266
You are more important
to me than them

33:27.309 --> 33:30.791
or anything else.I feel the same way.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.836
It's also on me to
make sure we're solid

33:32.880 --> 33:35.535
the way Deacon and Annie are.
I know we can be.

33:35.578 --> 33:38.103
No. We will be.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.410
Caveat emptor, young lady.

33:41.454 --> 33:42.803
Sorry, what?

33:42.846 --> 33:45.545
Buyer beware, especially when
the goods are bad.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.112
Screen came back
on the pot gummies.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.417
They're pretty lame.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.767
Barely any potency.Wait, that's good news.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.421
Traces were negligible.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.641
Also, the Standards Bureau
found no intent or impropriety.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.251
You did it by the book,

33:56.295 --> 33:58.297
and they took that into
consideration, too.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.950
They also appreciated
you coming in today,

33:59.994 --> 34:03.867
advocating for Victor, so you've
been officially exonerated.

34:03.911 --> 34:04.999
Yes!

34:05.043 --> 34:06.392
Team's gearing up
in the motor pool.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.046
I'm back on active duty?

34:08.089 --> 34:10.091
If you hurry, catch your squad
before they leave the building.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.224
[chuckles] Go.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.313
And be careful.You heard the young lady.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.358
Beat it.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.060
[sighs]

34:22.103 --> 34:25.106
[siren wailing]

34:25.150 --> 34:26.673
LUCA: 22-David to
Command, show 114

34:26.716 --> 34:28.370
en route to location.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.546
Nice having you back
with us, Tan.
Thanks.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.244
I was worried I might not see
the front seat again.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.072
Yeah, well, you can thank Street
for keeping it warm for you.

34:34.115 --> 34:35.682
STREET:
Hey, you sure you want
in on this mission?

34:35.725 --> 34:38.380
We're raiding a coke operation,
not a grow farm.TAN: Ha ha.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.208
You know, Street, I thought
I'd see what it was like

34:40.252 --> 34:42.167
for you getting kicked off SWAT,
but I backed out last minute.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.517
Ooh, ouch, I got to give
that round to Tan, Street.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.085
Coke shipment gets into LAX
in ten minutes.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.130
The contact's gonna let us know
when the convoy's fully loaded

34:49.174 --> 34:50.958
and about to leave.Then we grab the drugs

34:51.001 --> 34:52.525
at the customs depot
before they hit the road.

34:52.568 --> 34:54.135
We end Murido's
operation for good.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.355
And if the big guy
happens to be there,

34:56.398 --> 34:58.052
all the better.

35:07.279 --> 35:08.541
Thank you.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.590
[siren wailing]

35:16.549 --> 35:19.029
LAPD! Get on the ground!
Do it now!

35:19.073 --> 35:20.509
[Chris shouting in Spanish]

35:20.553 --> 35:23.382
STREET: Drop your weapons!
On the ground!TAN: LAPD!

35:23.425 --> 35:24.861
[shouting in Spanish]LAPD! Do it now!

35:34.523 --> 35:37.439
Hands behind your back!
Come on!

35:46.187 --> 35:48.189
Murido.

35:48.233 --> 35:49.799
LAPD! Get on your knees!

36:02.638 --> 36:03.683
Stay down.

36:03.726 --> 36:06.816
Police. Stop right there.

36:10.951 --> 36:13.301
I don't have to obey you.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.956
I work for the CIA.Yeah, well,
I got to call them

36:15.999 --> 36:17.566
to come down
and get you.

36:17.610 --> 36:20.047
So, until then, you stay.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.667
[groaning]

36:34.583 --> 36:37.238
Let me know if those
are too tight for you.

36:41.286 --> 36:45.159
Guess who we happened to find
at the drug seizure.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.640
[sighs] Tell your guys
to uncuff him, please.

36:47.683 --> 36:48.902
The cuffs stay on.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.295
His two hit squad
shooters talked.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.079
They'll testify
that Murido ordered

36:52.122 --> 36:54.299
the Flower Outlet shooting and
the attack on Deacon's house.

36:54.342 --> 36:56.475
That's multiple homicides.
I'm pretty sure that meets

36:56.518 --> 36:58.259
your threshold of proof,
Agent Devereaux.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.435
I gave you his entire
operation. We had a deal.

37:00.479 --> 37:03.133
We still do, as long as you
stick to the terms.

37:03.177 --> 37:04.483
Murido gets official
persona non grata designation

37:04.526 --> 37:06.485
from the State Department.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.661
You take him back to Colombia.
He can give you all the valuable

37:08.704 --> 37:09.879
intel you need down there,

37:09.923 --> 37:11.577
but he never sets foot
in the U.S. again.

37:11.620 --> 37:14.232
And what about
his medical treatments?That's not our problem.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.538
But I have to figure flying
the medication down to him

37:16.582 --> 37:18.671
has to be cheaper
than flying him up every month.

37:18.714 --> 37:22.283
[sighs] I guess I have
no choice, do I?

37:22.327 --> 37:25.460
No, you don't.Not unless you want to read
about it in the papers tomorrow.

37:25.504 --> 37:27.114
[sighs]

37:31.336 --> 37:33.294
We got what we wanted.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.296
Murido's gone, and his
coke's off our streets.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.602
I'm glad it worked out.

37:36.645 --> 37:38.691
Would've been awkward
being on a panel

37:38.734 --> 37:41.563
having to choose
your replacement.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.696
You know,
one of these days

37:43.739 --> 37:45.785
very soon, you're
gonna have to make

37:45.828 --> 37:47.265
a decision.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.744
What decision is that?

37:48.788 --> 37:51.791
Whether you're
one of us or not.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.793
You know, when I
told you and your men

37:53.836 --> 37:56.448
that Murido was off limits,
I knew you'd still go after him.

37:56.491 --> 37:59.799
You got your man, and I
preserved my-- and the city's--

37:59.842 --> 38:01.496
relationship
with the Feds.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.803
We both won.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.979
And the answer to
your question, Commander, is:

38:06.022 --> 38:08.677
I'm one of you when I need to be
and I'm not when I don't.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.636
How convenient.
We'll figure
it out as we go,

38:10.679 --> 38:12.986
on a case-by-case basis.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.640
See you tomorrow.

38:18.644 --> 38:21.081
Come here.[cell phone chimes]

38:23.605 --> 38:26.260
Oh, my sister says that
we can stay at her place.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.306
[sighs]

38:34.442 --> 38:38.054
Daddy, are you sure
it's safe now?

38:38.098 --> 38:39.752
Yeah, honey, it's very safe.

38:39.795 --> 38:40.927
You promise?

38:40.970 --> 38:44.060
Come here. [grunts]

38:44.104 --> 38:46.324
Lila, I promise.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.935
You can always trust me.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.331
Let's go.
Okay.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.333
[chuckles]

38:59.772 --> 39:01.774
[coughs]

39:04.733 --> 39:08.694
What's the deal, Pop?

39:08.737 --> 39:11.697
Talk to me. It ain't cool
you ignoring me like this.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.002
I got your voice mails.

39:13.046 --> 39:15.135
I knew you'd come home safe.
You always do.

39:15.178 --> 39:16.528
How's Deacon?

39:18.443 --> 39:21.402
Deacon's gonna be all right.
His family, too.

39:21.446 --> 39:22.838
Glad to hear that.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.538
Another long day, huh?

39:26.581 --> 39:29.149
That ain't important
right now, Pop.

39:29.192 --> 39:30.977
Look, I need you
to come with me.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.587
I got to get you
to the doctor.

39:32.631 --> 39:35.024
Don't want no damn doctor.Pop, you are sick.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.374
I know I'm sick![tools clatter]

39:36.417 --> 39:37.940
Don't need no doctor
telling me

39:37.984 --> 39:39.725
what I already know, okay?

39:39.768 --> 39:42.771
Are you for real right now?
This could be serious.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.600
Look, I don't know
how much time I got left, okay?

39:45.644 --> 39:50.562
But I don't want it spent being
poked and prodded and monitored,

39:50.605 --> 39:53.565
and having everybody
feeling sorry for me.

40:00.615 --> 40:03.488
Look, I wasn't there for
you when you needed me,

40:03.531 --> 40:04.967
so you don't owe me nothing.

40:05.011 --> 40:08.449
This ain't about
owing you anything.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.364
I'm your son,

40:10.408 --> 40:11.670
and if there's something
wrong with you,

40:11.713 --> 40:13.280
I'm gonna help you
get through it.

40:14.847 --> 40:17.850
