WEBVTT

00:01.714 --> 00:04.243
All right, ladies, how are we feeling

00:04.245 --> 00:06.011
about these wedding cake choices?

00:06.013 --> 00:07.746
My favorite is the rum soaked.

00:08.292 --> 00:09.748
- None of them are rum soaked.
- All mine are.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.484
Thank you so much for
tasting these cakes with me.

00:12.486 --> 00:13.985
No problem... I moved
Pilates to tomorrow,

00:13.987 --> 00:15.687
and I rescheduled my teeth cleaning.

00:15.689 --> 00:17.689
Though after all this cake, I
will definitely need Pilates

00:17.691 --> 00:18.891
and a dentist and maybe a shot

00:18.900 --> 00:20.059
of insulin.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.726
Hank is so busy at work lately.

00:21.728 --> 00:24.896
At this rate, I may need
you to pinch-hit as the groom.

00:24.898 --> 00:26.598
And for the record, I
do look great in a tux

00:26.600 --> 00:28.533
and a shoe-polish mustache.

00:28.535 --> 00:30.034
In the eighth grade, I
misunderstood the rules

00:30.036 --> 00:31.402
of the Sadie Hawkins dance.

00:31.404 --> 00:33.104
That's my girl. Go big or go home.

00:33.106 --> 00:34.405
I went home.

00:34.407 --> 00:36.274
You look great in anything.

00:36.276 --> 00:38.053
Isn't she a wonderful friend?

00:38.054 --> 00:39.637
Look at all that she's doing for you.

00:39.761 --> 00:41.679
Okay, so I do hate to ask you this,

00:41.681 --> 00:43.514
but there is one more
thing I need help with.

00:43.516 --> 00:44.748
Do you have any plans this weekend?

00:44.750 --> 00:46.184
Well, um, actually I have

00:46.186 --> 00:49.152
this awesome medical
conference in Palm Springs.

00:49.154 --> 00:51.121
It's, like, spring
break for skin doctors.

00:51.123 --> 00:53.757
But instead of wet T-shirts,
we wear long-sleeve T-shirts,

00:53.759 --> 00:56.059
because that desert sun is no joke.

00:56.061 --> 00:58.662
Sounds cool, uh, but I was gonna see

00:58.664 --> 01:00.330
if you could help work on
my invitations with me.

01:00.332 --> 01:01.632
Oh, of course you were, bride-rilla.

01:01.634 --> 01:03.367
I think you mean “bridezilla.”

01:03.369 --> 01:05.402
Uh, no, not when you're
acting like a big gorilla,

01:05.404 --> 01:07.837
pushing people around and
flinging your own poo.

01:07.839 --> 01:09.772
Okay, I think we can find some
time to do that before I go.

01:09.774 --> 01:11.074
Yeah, what are bridesmaids for?

01:11.076 --> 01:13.043
Mmm, well, historically,
they were decoys,

01:13.045 --> 01:15.512
so they would get kidnapped
before the bride would.

01:15.514 --> 01:17.947
Uh, but their lime-green dresses
always gave them away.

01:17.949 --> 01:20.783
She is so funny...

01:20.785 --> 01:23.085
and aggressive and always around.

01:23.087 --> 01:25.087
I think I have the liners
and envelopes in my car.

01:25.089 --> 01:26.923
- So I'm just...
- Great, I'm gonna help her.

01:28.927 --> 01:31.394
Oh, uh, by the way, you wanted me

01:31.396 --> 01:33.162
to remind you when it
was the first of the month.

01:33.164 --> 01:34.998
Yes, yes, awesome.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.566
Thank you so much.

01:37.568 --> 01:39.635
You remember any context
clues around that?

01:39.637 --> 01:41.437
Yeah, the context was rent.

01:41.439 --> 01:43.506
Rent. Uh, no, thank you.

01:43.508 --> 01:45.908
Saw it in the '90s, huge bummer.

01:45.910 --> 01:47.976
I'm more of an Annie gal myself.

01:47.978 --> 01:52.881
No, we agreed this month you were
going to start paying rent.

01:52.883 --> 01:57.419
Oh, I have your rent... right here.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.922
Well, don't get up.

01:59.924 --> 02:03.892
I am getting the impression from
the crossed-out word “classes”

02:03.894 --> 02:06.094
that this money was supposed
to be spent on classes?

02:06.096 --> 02:07.930
Yeah, I was gonna go back to school

02:07.932 --> 02:10.532
and learn a new skill set, better
myself and find a job.

02:10.533 --> 02:12.067
Well, what happened to your magic gig

02:12.069 --> 02:13.034
at the farmers' market?

02:13.036 --> 02:14.635
I lost it.

02:14.637 --> 02:16.604
You make a kid disappear for
20 seconds, you're a hero.

02:16.606 --> 02:19.407
20 minutes, you're a person of interest.

02:19.409 --> 02:22.810
You know what, I think
taking classes is a great idea.

02:22.812 --> 02:24.245
You should spend your
money on your education.

02:24.247 --> 02:25.746
That way you can get a regular job,

02:25.748 --> 02:26.981
and you can pay me every month.

02:26.983 --> 02:29.349
Wow, you are really a good friend.

02:29.351 --> 02:31.686
Just focus on your studies
and pay me when you can.

02:35.692 --> 02:37.491
Okay.

02:38.861 --> 02:39.961
Hey, Dad, you ready for lunch?

02:39.963 --> 02:40.962
Yeah, just a second.

02:40.964 --> 02:41.964
I'm having phone trouble.

02:41.965 --> 02:42.996
Oh, you know what?

02:42.998 --> 02:44.098
Tell me if you get this text.

02:46.001 --> 02:47.468
“Did you get this? Love, Dad.”

02:47.470 --> 02:48.868
Yeah, I got it.

02:48.870 --> 02:51.638
Old people always be
signing their texts.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.373
Damn it, this thing works.

02:53.375 --> 02:54.774
I haven't talked to Linda in days,

02:54.776 --> 02:56.243
and I just assumed that my cell phone

02:56.245 --> 02:57.811
and my computer and my iPad

02:57.813 --> 02:59.412
and my work line and my Blu-ray player

02:59.414 --> 03:00.379
were all on the fritz.

03:01.717 --> 03:03.850
- Sounds like you got ghosted.
- Maybe.

03:03.852 --> 03:05.251
I mean, I can't take it off the table,

03:05.253 --> 03:06.686
seeing as how I
don't know what it means.

03:06.688 --> 03:07.687
No, ghosting is when,

03:07.689 --> 03:09.022
instead of dumping you,

03:09.024 --> 03:10.523
someone stops communication altogether.

03:10.525 --> 03:11.925
Poof.

03:11.927 --> 03:13.727
They're gone.

03:13.729 --> 03:15.528
That's barbaric. Who would do that?

03:15.530 --> 03:16.795
- A spin instructor.
- What?

03:16.797 --> 03:17.997
Yeah, I just got ghosted

03:17.999 --> 03:18.998
by a spin instructor I'd been seeing,

03:19.000 --> 03:20.032
which was a huge bummer

03:20.034 --> 03:21.000
because as I said twice,

03:21.002 --> 03:22.168
she was a spin instructor.

03:22.170 --> 03:23.603
Linda would never do that to me.

03:23.605 --> 03:24.837
We did have a little tiff

03:24.839 --> 03:26.038
at our last movie night date, but...

03:26.040 --> 03:27.440
Tell me more about this tiff.

03:27.442 --> 03:28.874
Was it because you
were repeatedly trying

03:28.876 --> 03:29.942
to guess who the killer was?

03:29.944 --> 03:31.144
I wasn't guessing.

03:31.146 --> 03:32.945
It was the albino.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.847
He didn't have any melanin, but
he certainly had a motive.

03:34.849 --> 03:36.481
It's something that you do that's
totally annoying, Dad,

03:36.483 --> 03:39.584
and, unfortunately,
grounds for ghosting.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.986
Poof.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.220
Let's get lunch.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.791
Great work, everybody, huh?

03:45.793 --> 03:47.860
Wasn't that fun? So good.

03:47.862 --> 03:48.926
Oh, and, Phyllis, remember,

03:48.928 --> 03:51.296
silly accents are a comedy crutch.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.430
Amy?

03:52.432 --> 03:54.899
Oh, 'allo, guv'na.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.734
These are the classes
you've been taking?

03:56.736 --> 03:58.236
Improv?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.272
Well, I would come up
with a witty off-the-cuff way

04:00.274 --> 04:02.707
to say yes, but I am drained.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.543
I thought you were doing something
to help you get a job.

04:04.545 --> 04:08.146
Oh, I am. Improv school teaches
you to think fast on your feet.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.747
Here, give me a situation.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.182
- Here's a situation.
- Mm-hmm.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.917
You need a job so you can pay rent.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.418
Robots
don't pay rent.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.420
Nor do they feel love.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.588
And scene.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.156
Wow, that got sad.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.992
Tomorrow I'm gonna help
you find a real job.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.560
Oh, I already have a real job.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.428
One that pays.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.930
Oh, being a guardian
angel pays in smiles.

04:26.932 --> 04:28.199
Now give me one.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.736
Human,
you owe me a smile.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.185
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:39.369 --> 04:41.505
Allison, you don't
have to help me find a job.

04:41.507 --> 04:43.007
My gosh, I know how busy you are,

04:43.009 --> 04:45.008
what with Kelly's invitations,

04:45.010 --> 04:46.576
your Palm Springs convention.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.711
I know how important that is to you.

04:48.713 --> 04:51.447
Well, it is the Who's
Who of the SoCal derma world,

04:51.449 --> 04:53.416
but it's okay, I can be a little tardy.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.818
Anyway, so my friend told me

04:55.820 --> 04:57.854
they are looking for a
receptionist at their law firm.

04:57.856 --> 04:59.488
Oh, a receptionist.

04:59.490 --> 05:02.458
Well, I have been told I
have a very sexy phone voice.

05:02.460 --> 05:05.094
At least according to my
former boss at the hotline.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.429
No, it's not what you think.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.431
It was a suicide hotline.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.031
Ultimately, not a good fit.

05:09.033 --> 05:11.767
Okay, um, did you put
together a résumé like I asked?

05:11.769 --> 05:13.602
I did, I was up all afternoon.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.037
Okay.

05:15.039 --> 05:17.405
Uh, eclectic work history.

05:17.407 --> 05:20.241
Drug counselor, computer programmer.

05:20.243 --> 05:22.310
It says you were a licensed masseuse

05:22.312 --> 05:24.079
in the Albuquerque technique?

05:24.081 --> 05:25.914
Yeah, it's a modality of body work

05:25.916 --> 05:28.349
in which the practitioner
wears a lot of turquoise,

05:28.351 --> 05:31.787
and, uh, well, it gets
pretty unlicensed in the end.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.921
Under “objective,” it says “sustained.”

05:33.923 --> 05:36.458
Yes, I'm interviewing for
a legal position, correct?

05:36.460 --> 05:37.725
Yeah.

05:37.727 --> 05:39.060
Um, okay.

05:39.062 --> 05:40.561
So let's talk about your interview.

05:40.563 --> 05:42.129
Now, I...

05:42.131 --> 05:43.931
came up with a list of tips.

05:43.933 --> 05:45.633
- Thank you.
- Yep.

05:45.635 --> 05:48.235
And I bought you some
work-appropriate attire.

05:48.237 --> 05:51.271
Oh, Allison, I think I know what
work-appropriate attire is.

05:51.273 --> 05:53.207
Ooh, look at that.

05:53.209 --> 05:56.276
- Oh, a sleeved vest.
- It's a blazer.

05:56.278 --> 05:58.745
Well, what you call a
blazer, I call a sleeved vest.

05:58.747 --> 06:01.381
What you call overalls,
I call a panted vest.

06:01.383 --> 06:02.916
And what you call “keeping a secret,”

06:02.918 --> 06:04.318
I call “playing it close to...”

06:04.320 --> 06:05.285
I get it.

06:05.287 --> 06:06.620
“...the boobs,” Allison.

06:06.622 --> 06:08.722
“Playing it close to the boobs.”

06:08.724 --> 06:10.524
- Never anticipate me.
- Okay.

06:12.260 --> 06:14.027
You were right.

06:14.029 --> 06:15.028
She ghosted me.

06:15.030 --> 06:16.362
Poof?

06:16.364 --> 06:17.797
Poof!

06:17.799 --> 06:19.198
You're gambling online again?

06:19.868 --> 06:21.234
You know what you need?

06:21.236 --> 06:22.636
I'm taking you to a place

06:22.638 --> 06:24.038
where guys forget about their exes,

06:24.039 --> 06:27.073
clear their minds and just be men.

06:28.376 --> 06:30.743
Linda who? Am I right?

06:30.745 --> 06:33.579
That might be the
biggest rack I've ever seen.

06:34.649 --> 06:36.149
Ah, come to Papa.

06:36.151 --> 06:37.650
Yes.

06:37.652 --> 06:38.651
Thank you, Paulo.

06:38.653 --> 06:40.085
And, remember, green means go,

06:40.087 --> 06:41.053
so keep the meat coming.

06:41.055 --> 06:42.788
Yes.

06:42.790 --> 06:43.989
Hey, how'd the interview go?

06:43.991 --> 06:45.357
Pretty well, I think.

06:45.359 --> 06:47.325
I used those tips you gave me.

06:47.327 --> 06:50.062
I demonstrated a high
level of responsibility.

06:50.064 --> 06:51.296
Nice to meet you, Amy.

06:51.298 --> 06:52.865
Can I get you something to drink?

06:52.867 --> 06:54.066
No, I really shouldn't.

06:54.068 --> 06:55.834
I've already had a few.

06:55.836 --> 06:58.771
I established a personal connection.

06:58.773 --> 07:02.874
Might I say your
husband is quite bangable.

07:03.743 --> 07:05.277
That's my son.

07:05.279 --> 07:07.912
Oh, that explains the soccer uniform.

07:07.914 --> 07:10.549
And I wowed her

07:10.551 --> 07:12.551
with my extensive
knowledge of the legal system.

07:12.553 --> 07:17.455
I have been successfully
convicted of DUls and BUls.

07:17.457 --> 07:20.491
Biking, boating and beekeeping.

07:20.493 --> 07:22.694
Now...

07:22.696 --> 07:26.397
convince me why I should work for you.

07:28.534 --> 07:30.201
I think I'm in pretty good shape.

07:30.203 --> 07:33.270
They introduced me to HR
and the head of security.

07:33.973 --> 07:35.939
Feels like a done deal.

07:35.941 --> 07:38.576
Back again, Brad?

07:38.578 --> 07:41.545
Are you celebrating
another big win in online poker?

07:41.547 --> 07:43.147
What? I don't do that
anymore.

07:43.148 --> 07:44.915
'Cause of the promise I
made to this guy, my dad.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.183
Izabella, my dad.

07:46.185 --> 07:47.184
He just got ghosted.

07:47.186 --> 07:48.252
Let's talk about that.

07:48.254 --> 07:50.254
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:50.256 --> 07:51.554
Let me get you some meat.

07:51.556 --> 07:52.689
Hey, thanks.

07:52.691 --> 07:54.124
Hey, lucky Brad, eh?

07:54.126 --> 07:56.559
- No, just regular Brad tonight.
- Okay.

07:56.561 --> 07:58.461
I can't believe I got ghosted.

07:58.463 --> 08:00.430
Hey, that's the modern woman
for you, breaks your heart,

08:00.432 --> 08:01.898
then bikes into the sunset.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.399
Figuratively, of course.

08:03.401 --> 08:05.401
They actually bolt those
cycles to the floor.

08:05.403 --> 08:07.337
The kicker, of course, is
that men invented ghosting.

08:07.339 --> 08:09.839
We called it “I'm going
out for a pack of cigarettes”"

08:09.841 --> 08:11.507
which, by the way, was
nothing to be proud of.

08:11.509 --> 08:13.343
Of course not, but at least
we had the decency to lie.

08:13.345 --> 08:14.777
We could ghost an entire family.

08:14.779 --> 08:16.078
Yeah, ever hear of a deadbeat mom? No.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.980
- Never.
- And, again, just vile behavior.

08:17.982 --> 08:19.782
Atrocious.

08:19.784 --> 08:22.619
Uh, just so you know, even
if Linda hadn't ghosted me,

08:22.621 --> 08:25.354
- we were over.
- No doubt, she's awful.

08:25.356 --> 08:27.923
Oh, I wasn't ghosted. We're not over.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.691
Well, that bit me in the ass faster
than I thought it would.

08:29.693 --> 08:32.193
“Sorry, Marv, forgot to
turn my phone off airplane mode

08:32.196 --> 08:33.895
after the movie.”

08:33.898 --> 08:35.264
“Just now got your messages.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.765
How about we see each other tomorrow?”

08:36.768 --> 08:38.167
I am sorry for misleading you.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.701
You did not get ghosted.

08:39.703 --> 08:40.902
Congratulations.

08:40.904 --> 08:41.903
I'm glad for you, Dad.

08:41.905 --> 08:43.304
Although I still did.

08:43.307 --> 08:44.673
And it ends tonight.

08:44.675 --> 08:46.441
You know what, I'm taking a stand.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.076
For every guy that ever
sent a “What up, girl?”

08:48.078 --> 08:49.444
and never got a “'Sup?” back.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.945
You're ramping up. Where are we going?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.581
I'm gonna go do what no man in the midst

08:52.583 --> 08:53.948
of a gigantic Brazilian steakhouse meal

08:53.950 --> 08:54.983
has ever done before.

08:54.985 --> 08:57.152
I'm going to spin class.

08:59.890 --> 09:02.223
After the meat settles.

09:02.225 --> 09:04.692
Yeah, you got to take it easy now, okay?

09:04.694 --> 09:06.694
Let's go to the chicken next.

09:06.696 --> 09:08.629
Wow, well, I guess that's
your call then, huh?

09:08.631 --> 09:10.165
- And your loss.
- Huh?

09:10.167 --> 09:12.133
All right, take care.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.168
I got some really
bad and surprising news.

09:14.170 --> 09:16.103
- I didn't get that job.
- Ugh.

09:16.105 --> 09:18.172
Although they didn't say this,
I think I was a close second.

09:18.174 --> 09:20.107
I'll take comfort in that.

09:20.109 --> 09:22.876
I'm sorry. Well, we'll
keep looking until you get one.

09:22.878 --> 09:24.312
Wow, look at you still trying to help.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.714
That is both kind and
a little delusional,

09:26.716 --> 09:29.149
seeing as how you're a
three-dimensional being

09:29.151 --> 09:30.918
trying to help out an
eleven-dimensional one.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.585
All right, I've got exactly six hours

09:32.587 --> 09:33.987
to pick up... Wait, where are you going?

09:33.989 --> 09:35.622
I'm gonna get you that rent money.

09:35.624 --> 09:37.891
What? Oh. Oh, God.

09:37.893 --> 09:39.293
You're reaching into your vest.

09:39.295 --> 09:40.895
Please don't hold up that antique store!

09:40.896 --> 09:41.995
What are you doing?!

09:41.997 --> 09:45.598
All right, how much for that?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.077
- This old flask?
- Yeah, and don't

09:47.102 --> 09:48.601
try to low-ball me, all right?

09:48.603 --> 09:50.403
I know exactly how much it's worth.

09:50.405 --> 09:51.438
Amy, you don't have to do this.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.905
I'll give you 25 for it.

09:52.907 --> 09:54.674
Deal.

09:56.945 --> 09:58.911
Amy, you love that flask,

09:58.913 --> 10:01.381
and you're not gonna put a
dent in your money troubles

10:01.383 --> 10:03.182
by selling it for 25...

10:03.184 --> 10:05.017
$25,000.

10:05.019 --> 10:06.819
Here you go.

10:06.821 --> 10:09.155
And there you go.

10:09.157 --> 10:12.524
Wait, what? H-How is that
flask worth 25 grand?

10:12.526 --> 10:14.526
It's actually a very rare piece.

10:14.528 --> 10:17.663
And flasks are having a moment.

10:17.665 --> 10:19.065
So are vests.

10:19.067 --> 10:20.499
I'm white-hot, Allison.

10:20.501 --> 10:23.001
White-hot.

10:23.003 --> 10:24.035
Rent.

10:24.037 --> 10:25.838
No, no, not here.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.172
- You're dropping money.
- Oop.

10:27.174 --> 10:28.674
I got it. Fumble.

10:28.676 --> 10:31.343
Might I suggest a bank? Or investing it?

10:31.345 --> 10:33.111
Or at least taking it out
of that see-through bag?

10:33.113 --> 10:34.546
Well, I would love to, Allison,

10:34.548 --> 10:35.948
except angel rules explicitly state

10:35.949 --> 10:37.349
that no angel shall have

10:37.351 --> 10:39.851
more than $128 at the end of any day.

10:39.853 --> 10:43.221
And she needs to spend all of
that excess money on her human.

10:43.223 --> 10:44.689
- Amy, please.
- Mm-hmm?

10:44.691 --> 10:46.024
I have got to get these invitations out.

10:46.026 --> 10:47.392
And I have to get to Palm Springs.

10:47.394 --> 10:48.493
- The specialty cocktail?
- Yeah.

10:48.495 --> 10:49.794
The Ecze-margarita.

10:49.796 --> 10:52.463
The wine? Rosé-cea.

10:52.465 --> 10:53.898
It's gonna be off the hook!

10:53.900 --> 10:55.500
Oh, it's not.

10:55.502 --> 10:57.234
And you know how much trouble
I've been getting in

10:57.236 --> 10:59.303
with corporate lately,
so don't be a bummer.

10:59.305 --> 11:01.606
Let me spend 25 grand
on you in under a day.

11:01.608 --> 11:02.807
I don't have time to argue with you.

11:02.809 --> 11:04.208
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

11:04.210 --> 11:05.276
Oh, ma'am?

11:05.278 --> 11:06.911
I would like to give you

11:06.913 --> 11:08.546
$500

11:08.548 --> 11:10.147
for half that sandwich.

11:10.149 --> 11:11.715
Uh, yeah.

11:11.717 --> 11:14.952
Uh, not hungry for stranger food.

11:14.954 --> 11:17.254
Wow, you just dropped half a G

11:17.256 --> 11:18.822
on a boomerang sandwich.

11:18.824 --> 11:21.655
Geez, this is gonna
be easier than I thought.

11:26.529 --> 11:30.247
Okay, I have one $1,000 fan,

11:30.249 --> 11:33.150
$23,500 in cash.

11:33.152 --> 11:34.818
Who wants to play money grab?

11:35.366 --> 11:36.019
- Not me!
- Ah.

11:36.021 --> 11:37.555
I have got to get to Palm Springs.

11:37.557 --> 11:38.989
Clock is ticking on these invitations.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.557
Which apparently I'm doing myself.

11:40.559 --> 11:41.792
Well, what happened to Kelly?

11:41.794 --> 11:43.026
She drank way too much

11:43.028 --> 11:44.494
free champagne at the bridal shop

11:44.496 --> 11:46.096
and she needs a couple
hours to sober up.

11:46.098 --> 11:47.397
You can't get drunk

11:47.399 --> 11:48.899
on champagne.

11:48.901 --> 11:50.400
And you are a little
contortionist, aren't you?

11:50.402 --> 11:52.569
You are bending over backwards

11:52.571 --> 11:54.604
to please your friends.

11:54.606 --> 11:56.206
You're changing all your plans.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.774
You're letting one of
them buy you a trampoline.

11:58.776 --> 12:00.210
I don't want one.

12:00.212 --> 12:02.745
Well, then don't look
out in the backyard.

12:02.747 --> 12:04.347
Now what?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.115
Well, maybe it's something very helpful

12:06.117 --> 12:07.750
and expensive.

12:07.752 --> 12:09.385
Hmm, let's see.

12:10.222 --> 12:11.554
Hello, Ms. Fuller.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.888
I am Melvin.

12:12.890 --> 12:14.523
Your butler for the day.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.025
I did not order a butler.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.326
I did. Didn't tell you.

12:17.328 --> 12:18.894
Played that one close to the boobs.

12:18.896 --> 12:20.329
Come on in, Melvin.

12:20.331 --> 12:22.564
Get cracking.

12:22.566 --> 12:25.167
Would the lady of the
house care for a beverage

12:25.169 --> 12:27.169
or perhaps a light
dusting around the home?

12:27.171 --> 12:29.371
Actually, I would love a
cup of coffee and some help

12:29.373 --> 12:30.972
- with these invitations.
- As you wish.

12:30.974 --> 12:33.609
Your coffee will be
served in eight minutes.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.580
Are you okay?

12:38.582 --> 12:41.015
I don't need glasses.

12:47.791 --> 12:49.590
Reverse poof.

12:49.592 --> 12:51.592
I apologize for Sixth-Sensing you all.

12:51.594 --> 12:53.294
But this class is being taught

12:53.296 --> 12:55.230
by a ghost.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.065
Brad, what are you doing here?

12:57.067 --> 12:58.733
Striking a blow against ghosting.

12:58.735 --> 12:59.768
Noble cause, bro. That move is cold.

12:59.770 --> 13:01.236
Thank you, Bike Seven.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.770
When you disappeared on me,

13:02.772 --> 13:04.572
you deprived me of the
closure that man deserves.

13:04.574 --> 13:05.839
Nay, a human deserves.

13:05.841 --> 13:07.275
I only did that

13:07.277 --> 13:08.576
'cause I didn't want it to be awkward.

13:08.578 --> 13:10.177
That ship has sailed.

13:10.179 --> 13:11.345
Stay out of this, Bike Ten.

13:11.347 --> 13:12.446
I'm here now.

13:12.448 --> 13:13.814
So what happened with us?

13:13.816 --> 13:15.182
Tell me to my face.

13:15.184 --> 13:16.417
You really want to know?

13:16.419 --> 13:17.251
I deserve to know.

13:17.253 --> 13:19.086
On our first date,

13:19.088 --> 13:20.353
you were five minutes late.

13:20.355 --> 13:21.621
You talk about real estate a lot.

13:21.623 --> 13:23.157
You say the word “octopus” weird.

13:23.159 --> 13:24.524
And I think you might have
a gambling problem.

13:24.526 --> 13:26.093
Thank you.

13:26.095 --> 13:27.627
Now I know why we broke up.

13:27.629 --> 13:29.163
'Cause you're
judgmental and hypercritical.

13:29.165 --> 13:30.563
- Turned it around.
- Thank you, Bike Seven.

13:30.565 --> 13:32.166
You might want to clip in for this one.

13:32.168 --> 13:33.834
And that is why you had to
ghost me, because if you

13:33.836 --> 13:36.670
realized how absurd you
just sounded, oh, my God.

13:36.672 --> 13:38.438
Five minutes late? That's
California early.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.707
I was talking about real
estate, 'cause that's my job

13:40.709 --> 13:41.974
and you were buying a house.

13:41.976 --> 13:43.209
And I have no idea what you're

13:43.211 --> 13:45.144
- talking about with “octopause.”
- Octopus.

13:45.146 --> 13:47.580
- That's what I said, octopause.
- How are you not hearing this?

13:47.582 --> 13:49.416
Well, you know what I do know how to say

13:49.418 --> 13:51.050
that you don't?

13:51.052 --> 13:53.652
Good-bye.

13:55.156 --> 13:57.356
Um, what about the gambling?

13:57.358 --> 13:59.192
Shut up, Bike Ten.

13:59.194 --> 14:01.060
So, how's the pressure...
too much, too little?

14:01.062 --> 14:03.529
Why are you the one asking
me these questions?

14:03.531 --> 14:05.131
I paid a thousand
bucks for that massage.

14:05.133 --> 14:06.632
I'll ask all the questions I like.

14:06.634 --> 14:08.834
You know, this actually is relaxing.

14:10.137 --> 14:11.236
Was relaxing.

14:11.238 --> 14:13.004
Sorry. Allergies.

14:13.006 --> 14:14.540
Okay.

14:14.542 --> 14:15.574
I'm gonna run to the bathroom

14:15.576 --> 14:16.542
and get you an allergy pill.

14:16.544 --> 14:17.543
Uh, generous offer.

14:17.545 --> 14:18.644
However, there are

14:18.646 --> 14:19.745
no allergy pills.

14:19.747 --> 14:21.012
I crushed them all

14:21.014 --> 14:22.247
and used them to rim my margaritas.

14:22.249 --> 14:23.515
Maybe a little fresh air then?

14:23.517 --> 14:24.516
Okay.

14:24.518 --> 14:26.084
Coffee is served!

14:28.421 --> 14:31.189
Coffee will be served in eight minutes.

14:31.191 --> 14:34.459
Coffee will be served in eight minutes.

14:34.461 --> 14:38.330
Allison
rolled her eyes and shook her head.

14:38.332 --> 14:41.399
Her goals seemed
farther away now than ever.

14:41.401 --> 14:43.200
Not now, fake Morgan Freeman.

14:43.202 --> 14:44.635
Why is he here?

14:44.637 --> 14:47.304
Well, I can't afford the
real Morgan Freeman.

14:47.306 --> 14:51.242
And you once told me that his
voice was very soothing to you.

14:51.244 --> 14:53.911
Remember?

14:57.684 --> 15:01.752
And that is why I
also bought you a harpist.

15:03.789 --> 15:05.722
Okay, people.

15:05.724 --> 15:07.824
I should already be on
the road to Palm Springs,

15:07.826 --> 15:10.761
so if you're here to work,
I'm gonna put you to work.

15:10.763 --> 15:12.562
Everyone on the assembly line now!

15:12.564 --> 15:16.400
Allison was frustrated with everybody,

15:16.402 --> 15:18.268
save the Morgan Freeman impersonator,

15:18.270 --> 15:19.803
who was crushing it.

15:20.639 --> 15:22.105
<i>Okay.</i>

15:22.107 --> 15:23.607
I'm gonna try this movie thing again.

15:23.609 --> 15:25.074
I promise I've learned my lesson.

15:25.076 --> 15:26.910
Thank you for trying it my way.

15:26.912 --> 15:28.278
I'll talk to you in 90 minutes?

15:28.280 --> 15:29.780
Okay.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.152
- I can't do it.
- Oh.

15:36.154 --> 15:38.554
15 seconds in and I
know who the killer is.

15:38.556 --> 15:40.156
- Marv!
- It's the assistant football coach.

15:40.158 --> 15:41.757
We got to talk.

15:41.759 --> 15:43.092
What is going on?

15:43.094 --> 15:44.760
I like to guess whodunit.

15:44.762 --> 15:45.828
And you don't.

15:45.830 --> 15:47.397
And when I thought you ghosted me,

15:47.399 --> 15:49.698
I got to thinking, how
much do we have in common?

15:49.700 --> 15:51.634
Okay.

15:51.636 --> 15:53.836
So, tell me if you're
interested in any of the following,

15:53.838 --> 15:56.472
fixing old cameras, Sunday crosswords...

15:56.474 --> 15:58.774
I ghosted you on purpose
and then totally chickened out.

15:58.776 --> 16:00.743
Did not see that twist coming.

16:00.745 --> 16:02.145
I started to realize that we really

16:02.146 --> 16:04.012
don't have that much in common either.

16:04.014 --> 16:06.949
Other than being old friends.

16:06.951 --> 16:08.516
So maybe having shared memories

16:08.518 --> 16:11.519
isn't the same as
having shared interests?

16:12.823 --> 16:14.990
You can't say we didn't try.

16:14.992 --> 16:17.659
I think I know what might be

16:17.661 --> 16:20.662
a great ending to our movie.

16:21.665 --> 16:24.098
Not gonna happen, Marv.

16:24.100 --> 16:27.034
A gentleman always offers.

16:30.106 --> 16:32.440
Sorry about you and the spin instructor.

16:32.442 --> 16:33.508
Sorry about you and Linda.

16:33.510 --> 16:34.476
It's for the best.

16:34.478 --> 16:35.944
Some of the greatest movies

16:35.946 --> 16:37.911
have sad endings... Sophie's Choice.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.246
Terms of Endearment.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.114
Notebook.

16:40.116 --> 16:42.083
Gosling.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.650
And don't forget about the movie Seven.

16:43.652 --> 16:45.886
When he finds her head in the box.

16:45.888 --> 16:47.654
- Although I totally saw that coming.
- Really?

16:47.656 --> 16:49.556
That's one he didn't
even get. He was convinced

16:49.558 --> 16:51.692
it was just a cake in the box, right?

16:51.694 --> 16:52.926
You're so funny, Brad.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.195
“Cake in the box.”

16:57.800 --> 16:59.533
I'm beginning to think that
this never-ending meat parade

16:59.535 --> 17:00.934
has prevented me from realizing

17:00.936 --> 17:04.170
that she is Brazilian, hot and into me.

17:04.172 --> 17:06.740
If you'll excuse me, Dad.

17:07.843 --> 17:09.476
You know what?

17:09.478 --> 17:11.411
I'm gonna switch it to
green and let her come to me.

17:11.413 --> 17:13.445
Too much meat, getting
up too fast again?

17:13.448 --> 17:14.847
Don't know. Blacked out as soon

17:14.848 --> 17:16.682
as I stood up and got back down.

17:16.684 --> 17:19.785
Still kind of out of it.

17:19.787 --> 17:22.821
Okay, we have allergy
pills for the sneezy masseuse.

17:22.824 --> 17:25.290
Tissues for the harpist
with boyfriend problems.

17:25.292 --> 17:27.593
That's what I get for dating a woodwind.

17:27.595 --> 17:29.629
Allison rushed around, helping the folks

17:29.631 --> 17:31.764
that Amy had hired to help her.

17:31.766 --> 17:33.733
Uh, dude, this, uh, glue
stick isn't working.

17:33.735 --> 17:36.402
I know, I'm barely getting
a buzz.

17:36.404 --> 17:38.971
Well, it took 90 minutes
longer than expected,

17:38.973 --> 17:41.774
- but coffee is served.
- Thank you.

17:41.776 --> 17:43.275
Oh, my, it's so dark in here.

17:43.277 --> 17:45.610
Let me turn on some light.

17:46.813 --> 17:47.646
Oh, no.

17:50.784 --> 17:52.951
Oops, that was not the light.

17:52.953 --> 17:54.619
Okay, that's it!

17:54.621 --> 17:57.089
I have tried to be patient!

17:57.091 --> 17:59.024
But I am done taking care of you guys!

17:59.026 --> 18:00.859
And I am done taking care of Kelly!

18:00.861 --> 18:02.661
I am leaving for my trip right now.

18:02.663 --> 18:05.396
Because for once, I am
going to stop worrying

18:05.398 --> 18:07.231
about being a good
friend to everybody else,

18:07.233 --> 18:10.101
and just take care of myself.

18:16.076 --> 18:17.942
Okay.

18:17.944 --> 18:21.079
Why are you slow-clapping?

18:21.081 --> 18:23.781
Because you did it. You finally did it.

18:23.783 --> 18:26.217
You finally put your own needs

18:26.219 --> 18:28.586
ahead of everybody else's.

18:28.588 --> 18:30.421
What are you talking about?

18:30.423 --> 18:33.223
Allison, this has all been
a great big lesson for you.

18:33.225 --> 18:36.226
And my improv class!

18:36.228 --> 18:38.562
Oh, Amy, don't tell me...

18:38.564 --> 18:40.698
- Thing that you've been...?
- Yep, that's right.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.600
- These are all improv actors
- Oh.

18:42.602 --> 18:44.334
From my class.

18:44.336 --> 18:45.970
I watched the whole
thing from the window.

18:45.972 --> 18:47.771
Guys, you were amazing.

18:47.773 --> 18:50.039
Such great choices.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.808
Thanks for taking care of the baby.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.042
He's in on it, too?

18:53.044 --> 18:54.877
So, the flask, the money, the...?

18:54.879 --> 18:56.980
All improvised!

18:56.982 --> 18:58.881
Based on a loose outline.

18:58.883 --> 19:00.350
Okay, I get it.

19:00.352 --> 19:01.718
And like all improv shows,

19:01.720 --> 19:03.653
I'm left feeling unsatisfied

19:03.655 --> 19:05.622
and cheated out of my time.

19:05.624 --> 19:07.590
Thanks for the lesson. Time to go.

19:07.592 --> 19:10.359
All right, everybody, into
the garage for a cast party, huh?

19:10.361 --> 19:12.962
- Great work!
- Yeah.

19:12.964 --> 19:15.031
You were so grounded. It was so much fun.

19:15.033 --> 19:16.198
Well...

19:16.200 --> 19:17.634
You know, just like in class.

19:19.904 --> 19:22.371
Good work!

19:22.373 --> 19:24.140
- Hi.
- Hi!

19:24.142 --> 19:25.608
How are the invitations?

19:25.610 --> 19:27.876
Uh, well, I only got
about halfway through.

19:27.878 --> 19:29.678
And I'm already late for my conference.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.946
And to be honest with you,

19:30.948 --> 19:33.249
I could just use a
little time to myself.

19:33.251 --> 19:34.816
Oh, my gosh! Of course!

19:34.818 --> 19:36.785
I mean, you should've
said something sooner.

19:36.787 --> 19:38.587
You always put too
much pressure on yourself.

19:38.589 --> 19:40.555
I got it. I can take it from here.

19:40.557 --> 19:43.324
Okay.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.135
Hey, how was your conference?

19:49.137 --> 19:50.670
Awesome. Seminars all day.

19:50.672 --> 19:52.104
Swimming all night.

19:52.106 --> 19:54.307
Well, you're paler than when you left.

19:54.309 --> 19:55.908
- Thank you.
- Ooh!

19:55.910 --> 19:58.345
I have something for you.

19:58.347 --> 20:00.679
Your rent money.

20:00.681 --> 20:01.913
I thought that money was fake.

20:01.915 --> 20:03.349
Well, it was, but that there

20:03.351 --> 20:04.750
money is from my new job.

20:04.752 --> 20:06.552
I'm teaching that improv class now.

20:06.554 --> 20:07.720
Really?

20:07.722 --> 20:08.920
You're teaching improv?

20:08.922 --> 20:10.021
Yeah.

20:10.023 --> 20:11.423
And I'm really good at it, too.

20:11.425 --> 20:14.259
My mind just really lines up with it.

20:14.261 --> 20:17.695
You give me a character, and
I can stay in it for years.

20:17.697 --> 20:18.964
Hmm.

20:18.966 --> 20:21.432
Years.

20:21.434 --> 20:23.301
Oh, Allison had her doubts, sure.

20:23.303 --> 20:25.270
Who wouldn't?

20:25.272 --> 20:29.207
But deep inside, she wanted to believe.

20:29.209 --> 20:30.608
Didn't we all?

20:30.745 --> 20:32.178
I kept him over the weekend.

20:32.323 --> 20:34.846
You're right. It's so soothing.
