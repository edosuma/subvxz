00:01.654 --> 00:02.814
<i>Hello.</i>

00:02.934 --> 00:04.534
Hey, Rob.
Steve.

00:04.654 --> 00:05.694
<i>Oh, hiya.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

00:05.814 --> 00:06.894
Good.
Good.

00:06.974 --> 00:10.414
Uh... listen,
are you free next week

00:10.494 --> 00:11.534
to go away?

00:11.614 --> 00:13.134
<i>Where?</i>

00:13.254 --> 00:15.094
It's kind of a tour,
tour of the North,

00:15.174 --> 00:17.174
restaurant tour,
really good restaurants.

00:17.294 --> 00:19.214
<i>Right.</i>
<i>Why me?</i>

00:19.334 --> 00:22.054
Well, Mischa is unavailable.

00:22.134 --> 00:23.774
You've met Mischa, haven't you?

00:23.894 --> 00:25.974
<i>Uh, is she your assistant?</i>

00:26.094 --> 00:27.574
No, that's Emma.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.294
No.
No, Mischa's my girlfriend.

00:29.414 --> 00:31.334
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>the Australian girl.</i>

00:31.414 --> 00:33.414
No. God, no.
That was ages ago. No.

00:33.494 --> 00:34.774
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

00:34.894 --> 00:37.654
Mischa can't come,
and I don't want to go alone.

00:37.774 --> 00:41.774
I've asked other people,
but they're all too busy,

00:41.894 --> 00:44.214
so, you know,
do you want to come?

00:44.334 --> 00:46.494
<i>Uh... well, don't know, really.</i>

00:46.614 --> 00:47.894
<i>I'd have to ask Sally.</i>

00:47.974 --> 00:49.614
It's a job.

00:49.734 --> 00:51.334
I'm not asking you
to go on holiday with me

00:51.414 --> 00:52.494
or anything weird.

00:52.574 --> 00:53.774
It's for <i>The Observer Magazine.</i>

00:53.894 --> 00:54.934
<i>Right.</i>

00:55.054 --> 00:56.374
They're gonna pay
for everything,

00:56.494 --> 01:00.214
and there's a small fee,
which I'll split with you 60-40.

01:00.334 --> 01:01.934
<i>When is it?</i>

01:02.054 --> 01:02.934
Next Monday.

01:03.014 --> 01:04.694
<i>Oh.</i>

01:15.294 --> 01:17.654
Rob, Steve's here.

01:23.814 --> 01:25.454
- All right?
- Hey, yeah.

01:25.534 --> 01:26.414
- Hi, Steve.
- We're off.

01:26.494 --> 01:27.694
Hello. Hi.

01:27.814 --> 01:29.534
Ah, you know Sally and Chloe.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.174
- Yeah, yes. Hi. Hello. Hi.
- Nice to see you.

01:31.254 --> 01:32.334
How are you?

01:32.414 --> 01:33.294
Very good.

01:33.374 --> 01:34.454
- Nice to see you.
- Hello.

01:34.574 --> 01:36.494
What is that?

01:36.574 --> 01:38.734
This, just pickax handles.

01:39.814 --> 01:40.934
- Seriously?
- Climbing gear.

01:41.014 --> 01:42.534
- Yeah, just in case we...
- We're climbing?

01:42.614 --> 01:43.974
Got you a set of crampons too.

01:44.054 --> 01:44.974
I'll ring you, okay?

01:45.054 --> 01:47.494
Oh, yes, please do.
I love you.

01:49.174 --> 01:50.894
Look after mummy.
Give me a kiss.

01:51.014 --> 01:51.894
Have fun.

01:51.974 --> 01:53.254
Give him a kiss.

01:53.334 --> 01:56.974
If you haven't heard
anything from me in five days,

01:57.054 --> 01:58.294
alert the authorities.

01:58.414 --> 02:00.014
I'll send out a search party.
Drive safely.

02:00.094 --> 02:01.214
- Okeydoke.
- Bye-bye.

02:01.334 --> 02:03.094
- Have a good time.
- Give a little wave to you.

02:03.214 --> 02:04.934
I give a little wave to you.

02:05.014 --> 02:06.094
No?

02:06.174 --> 02:08.133
I'm gonna give
another little wave to you.

02:08.214 --> 02:10.413
- Oh, I'm going. Bye-bye.
- Bye. Bye.

02:10.533 --> 02:11.414
Bye-bye.

02:11.494 --> 02:13.014
Can you say good-bye to Dad?

02:13.134 --> 02:14.814
Say good-bye.
Are you gonna wave?

02:14.934 --> 02:19.894
I thought we'd go M1, M6,
come off at junction 31,

02:20.014 --> 02:26.454
and there's a short drive
on the A59 to Clitheroe.

02:26.574 --> 02:30.574
From there, it's a very short
hop to Whitewell.

02:30.654 --> 02:31.854
And how long will that take?

02:31.974 --> 02:33.134
- About four hours.
- Four hours?

02:33.214 --> 02:34.254
That's not very much.

02:34.334 --> 02:36.214
Why aren't we using sat nav?

02:36.294 --> 02:37.214
I've always liked maps.

02:37.334 --> 02:38.614
When we would go
on holiday as kids,

02:38.734 --> 02:40.534
my dad would plan the route,
you know,

02:40.654 --> 02:42.734
and show us on the map
what the route was,

02:42.814 --> 02:43.974
and we'd all follow it,
you know?

02:44.054 --> 02:45.094
It was great.

02:45.174 --> 02:46.894
The good news is,
I've found the M1.

02:46.974 --> 02:48.374
Ah.

02:48.494 --> 02:51.094
I wouldn't have had you down
as having a four-wheel drive.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.054
It's not mine.

02:52.174 --> 02:54.094
Mischa thought it would be good.

02:54.214 --> 02:56.134
She thought it would be useful
in the Lake District,

02:56.214 --> 02:57.774
the Yorkshire Dales.

02:57.854 --> 02:59.654
You know, it's not
like down south, Rob.

02:59.734 --> 03:01.934
There's a lot
of bumpy roads up there.

03:03.854 --> 03:05.654
Where... why isn't she here?

03:05.774 --> 03:08.374
'Cause she's...
she had to go back to America.

03:08.494 --> 03:09.774
Oh, dear.

03:09.854 --> 03:11.374
Have you... you haven't separated?

03:11.454 --> 03:13.654
It's in limbo, you know?
It's in limbo.

03:13.774 --> 03:15.054
So is it all over?

03:15.134 --> 03:16.214
No. I don't know.
I don't know.

03:16.334 --> 03:17.654
It's just... it's all...

03:17.734 --> 03:20.054
Well, let's go here.
Let's get some breakfast here.

03:20.134 --> 03:23.294
Ah, oh,
no, let's not.

03:23.414 --> 03:26.254
I've been up since
half past 5:00 with Chloe,

03:26.374 --> 03:27.734
and I've not eaten
a single thing.

03:27.814 --> 03:28.894
Really?

03:29.014 --> 03:29.934
You could write about it.

03:30.054 --> 03:31.374
Why don't you
review the food and say,

03:31.454 --> 03:33.814
"I'm staring off by talking
about what real people eat"?

03:33.934 --> 03:35.454
No, that's been done.

03:35.574 --> 03:36.774
That's been done before.

03:36.854 --> 03:39.214
It's 2010.
Everything's been done before.

03:39.294 --> 03:41.454
All you can do is do something
someone's done before

03:41.574 --> 03:43.774
but do it better or differently.

03:43.894 --> 03:46.134
To some extent,
that's correct.

03:51.494 --> 03:52.974
Why are we listening to this?

03:53.054 --> 03:54.094
That's what I've chosen

03:54.174 --> 03:58.454
for the soundtrack
for this landscape.

03:58.534 --> 03:59.574
It's not expected.

03:59.694 --> 04:01.934
You think of that as industrial,
of sort of...

04:02.014 --> 04:03.414
associate that kind
of music normally

04:03.494 --> 04:04.574
with an urban landscape.

04:07.654 --> 04:15.054
# <i>Walk in silence #</i>

04:15.134 --> 04:19.334
# <i>Don't walk away #</i>

04:19.414 --> 04:23.414
# <i>In silence #</i>

04:23.534 --> 04:27.214
# <i>See the danger #</i>

04:27.294 --> 04:31.414
# <i>Always danger #</i>

04:31.534 --> 04:35.134
# <i>Endless talking #</i>

04:35.254 --> 04:39.334
# <i>Life rebuilding #</i>

04:39.414 --> 04:41.214
# <i>Don't walk away #</i>

04:52.374 --> 04:53.214
This looks lovely.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.614
Beautiful, isn't it, eh?

04:54.734 --> 04:57.614
It's the sort of place
you'd shoot a <i>Miss Marple.</i>

04:57.694 --> 04:58.974
Hello.

04:59.094 --> 05:00.174
Hi. Hi.

05:00.254 --> 05:02.814
Should be a reservation
under the name "Coogan."

05:02.934 --> 05:05.294
- Hi, Mr. Coogan.
- Two rooms under "Coogan."

05:08.174 --> 05:10.494
Sorry, we only have
one double room for you.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.654
Uh, it may be under his name,
Brydon.

05:12.774 --> 05:14.334
Is another room
under the name "Brydon"?

05:14.454 --> 05:17.334
No. No Brydons.
Sorry.

05:17.454 --> 05:19.294
I thought there should
have been two rooms booked.

05:19.414 --> 05:20.494
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

05:20.614 --> 05:21.774
This is Mr. Brydon.

05:21.894 --> 05:23.534
Can we book another room?

05:23.614 --> 05:25.374
I'm sorry, but we're
fully booked tonight, sir.

05:25.494 --> 05:27.214
Can share.
That's all right.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.454
- No, we can't.
- It's a big room.

05:29.574 --> 05:32.374
Right, I'm gonna call Emma
and get to the bottom of this.

05:32.494 --> 05:34.334
I just said, seriously,
I don't mind sharing a bit.

05:34.454 --> 05:35.734
There's no signal here.
What do I do?

05:35.854 --> 05:37.854
Sometimes
you can get it outside.

05:37.974 --> 05:39.094
- Okay.
- At the back.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.934
Okay. All right.
I'll try and sort this out.

05:42.014 --> 05:44.374
Oh, dear me.

05:45.934 --> 05:46.974
Hello.

05:47.094 --> 05:48.374
- Hi.
- <i>Hiya.</i>

05:48.494 --> 05:50.814
Emma, listen,
I'm at the inn at Whitewell.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.014
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:52.134 --> 05:53.214
There's only one room.

05:53.334 --> 05:55.374
Well, you can stay
with Mischa, can't you?

05:55.494 --> 05:57.934
I'm not with Mischa.
I'm with Rob Brydon.

05:58.014 --> 05:58.974
Well, this is lovely.

05:59.094 --> 06:00.254
I mean, I'd be happy
to sleep here.

06:02.214 --> 06:03.494
Put a little bed down there,

06:03.574 --> 06:05.214
and I'd sleep there
very happily.

06:05.334 --> 06:06.974
So are you friends or...

06:07.094 --> 06:08.494
- No, we work together.
- Okay.

06:08.614 --> 06:10.454
So I'm just, you know...
I'm just with him.

06:10.574 --> 06:11.494
Are you his assistant or...

06:14.334 --> 06:15.574
In a way, yes.

06:15.694 --> 06:17.334
<i>I thought you said</i>
<i>you were going with Mischa.</i>

06:17.454 --> 06:18.974
No, I said I was thinking
of going with Rob.

06:19.094 --> 06:19.934
I told you.

06:20.054 --> 06:21.974
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

06:22.094 --> 06:24.694
Now I'm left having to share
a room with Rob for the night.

06:24.814 --> 06:26.174
I'm sorry. I messed up.

06:26.294 --> 06:28.694
Make sure all the other hotels
have got separate rooms, right?

06:28.814 --> 06:29.814
<i>Okay.</i>

06:29.934 --> 06:31.534
All right. Thank you.
All right, love. Bye.

06:31.614 --> 06:32.494
<i>Yeah, bye.</i>

06:32.574 --> 06:33.454
I'm sorry.

06:33.534 --> 06:34.654
It's a bit of a warren here.

06:34.774 --> 06:37.614
No, it's part of its charm.

06:37.694 --> 06:39.854
Thank you.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.174
So what's your name?

06:41.294 --> 06:42.134
- Magda.
- Magda.

06:42.254 --> 06:44.534
- And yours?
- Steve.

06:44.654 --> 06:49.094
Yes, none of this
"Mr. Coogan" nonsense.

06:50.454 --> 06:52.894
- So here it is.
- Oh, very nice.

06:53.014 --> 06:53.854
Beautiful, yeah.

06:53.974 --> 06:54.814
Very nice indeed.

06:54.934 --> 06:56.494
It's a very nice view.

06:56.614 --> 06:59.134
Look at that.
Very big.

06:59.254 --> 07:01.454
So...

07:01.534 --> 07:03.774
There we go.
Come on. Up you jump.

07:03.894 --> 07:05.494
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

07:05.614 --> 07:06.894
- Thank you.
- And here is the key.

07:06.974 --> 07:09.174
- Thanks, Magda.
- Bye.

07:09.294 --> 07:11.534
This is a huge bed.
We could easily share this bed.

07:11.614 --> 07:13.614
It might be huge to you.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.854
It's average size to me.

07:15.934 --> 07:19.134
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
You're considerably taller.

07:19.254 --> 07:21.214
What's the problem, anyway?

07:21.334 --> 07:22.694
What do you think
is gonna happen?

07:22.774 --> 07:24.934
Eh?

07:25.014 --> 07:26.454
You might touch my bottom.

07:26.574 --> 07:27.654
- All right.
- Even an accident.

07:27.734 --> 07:28.894
Were you an altar boy?

07:29.014 --> 07:30.374
Yes, I was.

07:30.454 --> 07:31.894
- Seriously?
- Yes.

07:32.014 --> 07:33.294
Oh, all right.

07:33.374 --> 07:35.014
Well, I'll go on the sofa
if you want, if it's...

07:35.094 --> 07:37.614
Sorry, I didn't realize we were
into Oprah Winfrey territory.

07:37.734 --> 07:39.774
Are you seriously saying
you were abused as a child

07:39.894 --> 07:41.054
when you were an altar boy?

07:41.174 --> 07:43.054
Only verbally.

07:43.134 --> 07:44.254
And physically.

07:44.374 --> 07:45.734
But not sexually.

07:45.814 --> 07:48.134
You know, just punched...

07:48.214 --> 07:49.254
by a priest.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.374
There's no signal here.
You won't get a signal.

07:54.454 --> 07:56.214
I'm on wireless.

07:58.734 --> 07:59.654
Ah.

07:59.774 --> 08:01.014
Yes, who's having scallops?

08:01.134 --> 08:02.454
I am the scallops.

08:02.574 --> 08:04.094
Thank you very much.

08:04.214 --> 08:05.294
And the soup.

08:05.414 --> 08:06.294
Thank you. Lovely.

08:06.374 --> 08:07.254
- Okay.
- Yes.

08:07.334 --> 08:08.214
Enjoy your starters.

08:08.294 --> 08:10.454
Thank you.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.014
Soup of the day.
Can't go wrong.

08:12.094 --> 08:13.014
Yeah. Yeah.

08:13.134 --> 08:14.894
Yours looks more interesting,
but...

08:22.094 --> 08:23.574
Mmm.
What's yours like?

08:23.694 --> 08:25.374
Well, it tastes of tomatoes.

08:25.494 --> 08:27.574
Not a connoisseur,
are you, with food?

08:27.694 --> 08:29.054
Look, the reason
I was doing this trip

08:29.174 --> 08:30.214
was to bring Mischa along.

08:30.294 --> 08:32.014
She's passionate about food.
She loves food.

08:32.134 --> 08:33.374
She's the food buff.

08:33.494 --> 08:35.813
She's the food...
she's a very confident foodie,

08:35.894 --> 08:37.294
and I thought she could help me,

08:37.374 --> 08:40.573
and I wanted
to show Mischa the...

08:40.693 --> 08:42.094
you know, the North,

08:42.214 --> 08:44.174
show her a piece of me.

08:44.254 --> 08:45.534
You're from Manchester.

08:45.654 --> 08:49.614
You could take her round and
show her the gun crime sites.

08:49.734 --> 08:50.654
I'm from the North.

08:50.774 --> 08:53.334
The North has an identity
of itself.

08:53.454 --> 08:56.254
Yeah, not the same way
that Wales does.

08:56.374 --> 08:57.214
I think it does.

08:57.334 --> 08:58.334
I think the North had...

08:58.454 --> 08:59.854
The North could be
a different country.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.614
It has as much of an identity
as Wales.

09:01.734 --> 09:04.334
Are you seriously saying that
you think the North of England...

09:04.454 --> 09:07.534
hang on... a stronger identity
than Wales?

09:07.614 --> 09:08.614
Yeah... yes.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.534
Industrial Revolution,

09:12.614 --> 09:15.214
the very first railway
in the world in Manchester,

09:15.334 --> 09:16.734
which revolutionized the world

09:16.854 --> 09:18.774
probably more than anything else
in the last 200 years.

09:18.894 --> 09:19.734
Richard Burton.

09:20.854 --> 09:22.494
Man from being
ex-prison admiral...

09:22.614 --> 09:24.094
napkins like God.

09:24.214 --> 09:25.574
Anthony Hopkins.

09:25.654 --> 09:26.974
I want a room with a view.

09:27.094 --> 09:27.934
I want to see a tree.

09:29.134 --> 09:31.014
I think anyone over 40
who amuses themself

09:31.094 --> 09:32.134
by doing impressions

09:32.214 --> 09:34.334
needs to take a long, hard look
in the mirror.

09:34.454 --> 09:37.734
Well, broadsheet journalists
have described my impressions

09:37.814 --> 09:39.534
as stunningly accurate.

09:39.614 --> 09:40.574
Well, they're wrong.

09:40.694 --> 09:42.094
I've not heard
your Michael Caine,

09:42.174 --> 09:44.054
but I assume it would be
something along the lines of:

09:44.134 --> 09:45.894
My name's Michael Caine.

09:45.974 --> 09:47.054
That is where you
are so wrong,

09:47.174 --> 09:48.654
and you can look
at my live video to prove...

09:48.774 --> 09:50.774
because that's the very thing
I don't do.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.134
I say that he used
to talk like that.

09:52.214 --> 09:54.094
- Do your Michael Caine.
- Okay.

09:54.174 --> 09:56.014
I say Michael Caine
used to talk like this

09:56.094 --> 09:57.294
in the 1960s, right?

09:57.414 --> 10:00.094
But that has changed,
and I say that over the years...

10:00.214 --> 10:01.574
Michael's voice...

10:01.654 --> 10:02.894
has come down...
several octaves.

10:03.014 --> 10:04.014
Let me finish.

10:04.094 --> 10:05.854
And all of the cigars

10:05.974 --> 10:07.934
and the brandy don't...
let me finish...

10:08.054 --> 10:09.694
...can now be heard...
- Okay.

10:09.814 --> 10:11.654
I've not fucking finished.

10:11.734 --> 10:12.854
In the back of the voice,

10:12.974 --> 10:13.894
...and the voice now...
- Okay.

10:13.974 --> 10:16.454
Will... I've still not finished.

10:16.534 --> 10:19.214
'Cause you're panicking.
You know I'm about to...

10:19.294 --> 10:20.614
Because you look like

10:20.694 --> 10:21.654
you're about to bloody talk!

10:21.774 --> 10:23.054
Let me finish.

10:23.174 --> 10:25.454
Right,
so Michael Caine's voice now,

10:25.534 --> 10:28.854
in the Batman movies
and in <i>Harry Brown...</i>

10:28.974 --> 10:31.934
I can't go fast,
because Michael Caine...

10:32.054 --> 10:37.694
talks... very... very... slowly.

10:37.814 --> 10:39.294
Right, this is how
Michael Caine speaks.

10:39.414 --> 10:42.334
Michael Caine
speaks to his nose like that.

10:42.454 --> 10:45.574
He gets very, very specific.
It's very like that.

10:45.654 --> 10:48.974
When it gets loudly,
it gets very loud indeed!

10:49.094 --> 10:50.454
It gets very specific.

10:50.574 --> 10:51.814
It's not quite nasal enough

10:51.894 --> 10:53.134
the way you're doing it,
all right?

10:53.254 --> 10:55.774
You're not doing it
the way he speaks!

10:55.894 --> 10:57.894
You're not doing it
with the kind of...

10:57.974 --> 10:59.974
And you
don't do the broken voice

11:00.054 --> 11:01.294
when he gets very emotional,

11:01.374 --> 11:03.054
when he gets
very emotional indeed.

11:03.134 --> 11:06.654
She was only 16 years old.
She was only 16...

11:06.774 --> 11:09.534
You're only supposed to blow
the bloody doors off!

11:09.654 --> 11:11.094
That's Michael Caine.

11:17.534 --> 11:18.574
Excuse me. Sorry.

11:18.694 --> 11:20.294
- Thank you very much.
- Was everything okay?

11:20.374 --> 11:21.574
Oh, it was very nice indeed,
yeah.

11:21.654 --> 11:22.534
Quite tomato-y.

11:22.614 --> 11:25.454
- And soupy.
- Thank you.

11:25.534 --> 11:27.014
Hotter than I was expecting.

11:27.094 --> 11:28.494
More heat in the chili sauce.

11:28.574 --> 11:31.214
There was a lot of heat
in my scallops.

11:31.334 --> 11:34.014
- My scallops were hot.
- There's a joke there.

11:34.134 --> 11:35.694
Plenty of heat

11:35.814 --> 11:37.534
in my scallops.

11:37.654 --> 11:38.494
<i>Heat.</i>

11:38.614 --> 11:41.174
Pacino. De Niro.
Michael Mann.

11:41.294 --> 11:42.654
What do you got?

11:42.774 --> 11:47.014
Four bodies in a morgue.
I'm out there every fucking day.

11:47.094 --> 11:48.534
Ugh.

11:48.654 --> 11:49.494
- Yeah? <i>Heat.</i>
- Yeah?

11:49.614 --> 11:51.974
A movie where De Niro
and Pacino

11:52.054 --> 11:53.574
are running
a celebrity magazine.

11:53.654 --> 11:54.814
What do you got?

11:54.934 --> 11:58.734
I need a photo exclusive
of Katie Price having a botox.

11:58.814 --> 12:01.334
Ain't got it, Al.
We can't do it. We can't do it.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.694
It's not looking...

12:02.774 --> 12:04.614
What do you mean
it's not looking good?

12:04.694 --> 12:07.574
I got to have her
on the front page right now!

12:07.694 --> 12:09.614
Every day I'm there!

12:09.734 --> 12:11.494
Hey, calm it down.
All right. Sorry.

12:13.574 --> 12:15.214
It's all right.
They don't mind. They love it.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.334
Yeah, well, not sure
about that, but anyway...

12:17.454 --> 12:18.774
Ever worked with Michael Mann?

12:18.894 --> 12:20.774
I don't work with
mainstream Hollywood directors.

12:20.854 --> 12:21.774
I work with auteurs.

12:21.854 --> 12:23.054
Like in <i>Rain Man?</i>

12:23.174 --> 12:25.054
Oh, I'm an excellent director.

12:25.174 --> 12:26.094
I'm an excellent director.

12:26.174 --> 12:28.174
I directed the whole movie
in one go.

12:28.294 --> 12:29.454
No, that's autistic.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.574
I know that.

12:30.654 --> 12:32.174
I wonder...
that's autistic savant.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.574
Is there such a thing as
an autistic impressionist?

12:34.654 --> 12:35.774
'Cause if there is,

12:35.894 --> 12:38.934
I think that might be the key
to your condition.

12:39.054 --> 12:41.414
Maybe you're right.

12:41.494 --> 12:46.694
I don't know, but I see a guy
with something stuck up his ass

12:46.774 --> 12:51.974
who's too uptight to let go.

12:52.054 --> 12:54.974
No, I like humor.
I like levity. I like brevity.

12:55.094 --> 12:56.014
I just like to...

12:56.134 --> 12:58.134
Gravity?
Where do you stand on that?

12:58.254 --> 13:00.894
Um, firmly.
On terra firma.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.854
You like
levity, brevity, and gravity.

13:03.974 --> 13:05.494
It's great to meet you.

13:05.614 --> 13:06.614
It's terrific to meet you.

13:06.734 --> 13:08.214
I got to tell you,
you're a terrific actor.

13:08.334 --> 13:09.214
I like your work.

13:09.334 --> 13:10.894
I caught your work
the other day.

13:11.014 --> 13:13.614
I was watching the television
in my room, and I said,

13:13.734 --> 13:15.094
"Who is this guy?

13:15.174 --> 13:17.134
"He's not as tall as Coogan,
but he's better.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.094
I like him a lot."

13:19.174 --> 13:23.414
Do you find
as you get older...

13:23.534 --> 13:25.854
food gets stuck
in your teeth more?

13:25.974 --> 13:27.214
Oh, yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

13:27.334 --> 13:29.294
- More readily?
- You know why that is?

13:29.414 --> 13:32.094
- Why?
- Receding gums.

13:33.574 --> 13:37.614
Revealing the crack, the gap,
between the tooth and the gum.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.494
As you... look, look.
Look how much... look.

13:42.654 --> 13:43.534
What are you showing me?

13:43.614 --> 13:45.374
My gums.

13:48.014 --> 13:51.094
Those look all right,
you know.

13:51.214 --> 13:53.974
Can you see them receding?

13:54.094 --> 13:55.254
- Mm, yes. Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:55.374 --> 13:59.454
Well, that is a honey trap
for morsels of food.

13:59.574 --> 14:00.814
That is an open invitation.

14:00.894 --> 14:03.934
A bit of food sees that,
he goes running towards it.

14:04.054 --> 14:05.654
It's not good
if you're on a date.

14:05.774 --> 14:06.974
You still go on dates, do you?

14:07.094 --> 14:08.494
Yeah, if I want to pick my...
what I do is,

14:08.574 --> 14:09.534
I normally go to the toilet.

14:09.654 --> 14:10.894
I take a toothpick,
go to the toilet,

14:11.014 --> 14:12.534
and just get every little bit
out of my teeth,

14:12.654 --> 14:14.814
or I try to avoid foods that get
lodged in your teeth, 'cause...

14:14.934 --> 14:16.014
Really?

14:16.094 --> 14:17.614
You don't want to try
and go and kiss a girl

14:17.694 --> 14:19.814
with a big lump of chicken stuck
inside of one of your molars.

14:19.894 --> 14:22.414
See that strikes me as odd,
that a man at our age

14:22.534 --> 14:25.134
would be thinking
about trying to kiss girls.

14:25.214 --> 14:26.894
- Hi, sorry.
- Hello.

14:26.974 --> 14:28.854
It's your lucky day.

14:28.974 --> 14:30.614
- Why?
- We've had a cancellation.

14:30.734 --> 14:32.014
You don't have
to share a bed tonight.

14:32.134 --> 14:33.454
I'll drink to that.

14:33.534 --> 14:37.614
Shall I leave you in room 15
and move Mr. Brydon into 7, or...

14:37.734 --> 14:39.174
Which is the better room?

14:39.254 --> 14:42.294
7 is a bit bigger,
but I prefer 15.

14:42.414 --> 14:43.614
Maybe you want to see it?

14:43.734 --> 14:45.934
Um... yes, I think I would.

14:46.054 --> 14:47.414
Do you mind excusing me?

14:47.494 --> 14:49.454
I could come as well
if you want.

14:49.534 --> 14:50.854
Nah.

14:56.054 --> 14:56.974
Yeah, it's open.

15:01.574 --> 15:03.054
- Sorry.
- Okay.

15:03.174 --> 15:06.294
Okay, so this is
room number 7.

15:06.414 --> 15:07.534
That's nice, yeah.

15:07.654 --> 15:09.254
Beautiful room.

15:09.334 --> 15:11.414
- Nice view.
- Yeah?

15:11.534 --> 15:13.814
I find the view
is very important.

15:13.934 --> 15:15.574
You can't go wrong
around this area.

15:15.694 --> 15:17.134
Everything's beautiful.

15:17.254 --> 15:18.974
It is. I know.
It's true.

15:21.774 --> 15:22.854
It's pretty high, isn't it?

15:22.934 --> 15:24.374
It reminds me
of <i>The Princess and the Pea.</i>

15:24.494 --> 15:25.494
Do you know that?

15:25.614 --> 15:26.974
- Yes, I do.
- Hans Christian Andersen.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.654
Do you have...
Do you know him in Poland?

15:28.734 --> 15:31.374
Of course.
Of course we read.

15:31.454 --> 15:32.974
Yeah, no, we do read.

15:33.094 --> 15:34.654
Right. Okay.
Where is he from?

15:34.774 --> 15:37.094
- Um... Denmark.
- Denmark. That's right. Yes.

15:37.174 --> 15:38.734
Denmark. Yeah.
I don't like the Danish.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.574
No, it's like that, isn't it?

15:40.694 --> 15:41.614
No, it's like that.

15:41.694 --> 15:43.574
Through the nose.
Through the nose.

15:43.654 --> 15:45.774
Michael Caine's voice
is through the nose.

15:45.854 --> 15:47.654
So how long
have you worked here?

15:47.734 --> 15:49.454
- Long?
- Almost a year.

15:49.534 --> 15:50.934
Right. Okay.

15:51.014 --> 15:52.654
So you and Rob,
do you work a lot together or...

15:52.734 --> 15:53.614
Very rarely.

15:53.694 --> 15:54.814
If I can avoid it.

15:54.934 --> 15:56.854
I mean, you seem
to know each other quite well.

15:56.974 --> 15:59.054
It's all right, but the
relationship's purely platonic.

15:59.134 --> 16:00.694
So what should we do?

16:00.814 --> 16:02.574
Well, which is the one
you liked?

16:02.694 --> 16:04.054
15.
Yeah, I prefer 15.

16:04.174 --> 16:05.334
I think we should
go with that.

16:05.454 --> 16:07.294
Do they accommodate you here,
or do you have, like...

16:07.414 --> 16:10.054
There are cottages for
the staff at the main house,

16:10.134 --> 16:11.694
so yes, I live nearby.

16:11.814 --> 16:12.654
Well, that's handy.

16:12.774 --> 16:14.454
I'm very nearby, yeah.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.974
Hi, is that Greg?

16:16.054 --> 16:16.934
<i>It is, yes.</i>

16:17.014 --> 16:17.894
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, how are you?</i>

16:17.974 --> 16:18.854
Very good.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.654
You emailed me,
asked me to call.

16:20.774 --> 16:22.374
Can you hear me, Greg?

16:23.894 --> 16:25.014
<i>No, I can't...</i>

16:25.134 --> 16:28.174
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

16:28.294 --> 16:29.774
Yes, yes.
I can hear you.

16:29.854 --> 16:30.974
Okay, I'll stay here.

16:31.094 --> 16:32.854
Right, <i>Doctor Who</i>
are very keen again.

16:32.974 --> 16:36.014
<i>Doctor Who?</i>
What, is it the baddie?

16:36.134 --> 16:37.054
Yep.

16:37.174 --> 16:38.694
I don't want to do British TV.

16:38.774 --> 16:40.254
Well, I mean,
all you need is...

16:40.374 --> 16:41.614
you just need one film, Steve,

16:41.734 --> 16:42.574
and that will propel you.

16:42.694 --> 16:44.334
I've done ten.

16:44.454 --> 16:45.614
You need the right film.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.694
You see, you've got
a huge amount of momentum

16:47.814 --> 16:48.974
<i>behind you.</i>

16:49.094 --> 16:50.974
Yeah, you get momentum
when you're going downhill.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.494
Well, yes, but...

16:52.614 --> 16:54.734
I want to be in films,

16:54.854 --> 16:55.734
good films.

16:55.854 --> 16:57.854
Where exactly are you
at the moment?

16:57.974 --> 17:00.574
<i>I'm in the Trough of Bowland.</i>

17:00.694 --> 17:04.094
Rather appropriately, Greg,
I'm in a trough,

17:04.214 --> 17:05.773
literally and metaphorically.

17:05.854 --> 17:08.134
Yeah, is Mischa with you?
Is she enjoying it?

17:08.214 --> 17:12.814
Yes, she's...
yes, she's... yes, she is, yeah.

17:59.334 --> 18:00.174
<i>Hello?</i>

18:00.294 --> 18:02.094
Hello?

18:02.174 --> 18:03.574
<i>Hey, it's me!</i>

18:03.654 --> 18:05.654
What time is it?

18:05.774 --> 18:10.614
It's, uh,
it's 12:00, your time.

18:10.734 --> 18:13.494
Oh, shit.
I'm late.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.734
Oh, you just got up?

18:15.854 --> 18:17.534
<i>Yeah, I had</i>
<i>a really late night.</i>

18:17.654 --> 18:20.374
<i>I guess I got in at, like,</i>
<i>3:00 or 4:00 maybe.</i>

18:20.494 --> 18:21.774
Where'd you go?

18:21.854 --> 18:25.854
<i>I told you, I went to this,</i>
<i>uh, magazine party,</i>

18:25.974 --> 18:27.454
<i>this magazine launch.</i>

18:27.574 --> 18:28.574
<i>I thought it'd</i>

18:28.694 --> 18:31.054
be a good place to go
and meet some people

18:31.134 --> 18:34.054
and pitch some of my ideas,
and it was really good.

18:34.134 --> 18:37.454
I met some amazing people,
and there's lots of interest.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.214
Yeah? Who'd you meet?
Who was interesting?

18:39.334 --> 18:42.654
<i>I met the, um,</i>
<i>the editor of</i> Esquire,

18:42.774 --> 18:45.054
and he, uh,

18:45.174 --> 18:47.934
<i>he's interested in the story</i>
<i>I did about the bikers</i>

18:48.054 --> 18:49.414
<i>when I went back home.</i>

18:49.494 --> 18:51.094
Does he fancy you?

18:51.214 --> 18:52.494
God, you know what?

18:52.614 --> 18:54.254
That really pisses me off
when you do that

18:54.334 --> 18:56.214
like I've got nothing else
to offer.

18:56.294 --> 18:57.334
- I'm not saying...
- <i>Whatever.</i>

18:57.454 --> 18:58.534
<i>Listen, listen, I've got to go.</i>

18:58.614 --> 19:00.734
- Hey, listen...
- <i>I'm gonna be late, okay?</i>

19:00.854 --> 19:06.014
Okay.
Hey, uh, uh, well, I miss you.

19:06.134 --> 19:08.654
Yeah, I miss you too.

19:08.774 --> 19:11.214
Good.

19:11.294 --> 19:12.334
I got to go.

19:12.414 --> 19:14.814
Listen, well, let's just
speak later, okay?

19:14.934 --> 19:16.734
- Okay.
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>

19:16.854 --> 19:18.614
- Bye. Bye, baby.
- <i>Bye.</i>

19:51.494 --> 19:52.654
Bye.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.414
Bye.

20:05.814 --> 20:08.734
I thought we'd go up
to Dunsop Bridge,

20:08.854 --> 20:10.734
up through
the Trough of Bowland,

20:10.814 --> 20:13.934
through Abbeystead,
get on the M6 at junction 33,

20:14.054 --> 20:16.654
then off at junction 36
a bit further up,

20:16.734 --> 20:19.814
and that'll take us
almost all the way to Cartmel.

20:21.414 --> 20:27.294
Did you cement
Anglo-Polish relations?

20:27.414 --> 20:32.294
There was a summit
in my bedroom.

20:32.374 --> 20:33.414
I won't go into detail,

20:33.494 --> 20:35.294
but there were more than talks
about talks.

20:35.414 --> 20:40.854
In fact, I'd go as far as to say
there was an historic accord.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.214
"What joy it was to be alive,

20:43.294 --> 20:45.334
but to be young
was very heaven."

20:45.454 --> 20:46.694
That's Wordsworth, I think,

20:46.774 --> 20:48.894
going on about
the French Revolution.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.414
That was when he was younger,

20:50.494 --> 20:52.654
before he started going on
about daffodils.

20:57.894 --> 20:59.294
This is a wild and windy moor.

20:59.414 --> 21:00.254
It is.

21:00.374 --> 21:01.694
Misty moor, really,
but, you know...

21:01.814 --> 21:03.534
- Christy Moore.
- Christy Moore.

21:03.654 --> 21:05.494
Bobby Moore. Dudley Moore.

21:05.614 --> 21:07.214
Roger Moore.
Kenneth Moore.

21:07.294 --> 21:08.614
Dudley and Peter.
Peter and Dudley.

21:08.694 --> 21:09.654
Oh, God.

21:11.974 --> 21:15.614
both: # Out on the wild
and windy moor #

21:15.734 --> 21:19.694
# We'd roll and fall in green #

21:19.814 --> 21:23.854
# You had a temper
like my jealousy #

21:23.974 --> 21:27.374
# Too hard, too greedy #

21:31.494 --> 21:33.734
Hello.

21:33.814 --> 21:37.414
- <i>Hi, it's me.</i>
- Hi, how are you?

21:37.494 --> 21:38.654
<i>Where are you?</i>

21:38.774 --> 21:42.334
I'm... we're just
in the Trough of Bowland

21:42.454 --> 21:43.294
heading towards...

21:43.414 --> 21:44.574
- Cartmel.
- Cartmel.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.214
<i>Can you...</i>
<i>can you talk to Joe?</i>

21:47.334 --> 21:48.414
What?

21:48.534 --> 21:50.734
<i>He's getting</i>
<i>a bit out of hand.</i>

21:50.854 --> 21:52.934
<i>He was drinking last night.</i>

21:53.014 --> 21:54.294
Oh, Christ's sakes.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.654
<i>I've had one</i>
<i>of his friend's parents call me</i>

21:56.774 --> 21:58.574
<i>concerned about his behavior</i>
<i>at their house,</i>

21:58.654 --> 22:00.414
<i>and he's been really ill</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

22:00.534 --> 22:02.534
<i>and he won't go to school.</i>

22:02.614 --> 22:03.494
Oh, Christ's sakes.

22:03.574 --> 22:04.854
<i>So I need you to talk to him,</i>

22:04.974 --> 22:06.734
<i>because he just doesn't listen</i>
<i>to me at the moment.</i>

22:06.814 --> 22:07.734
Okay, I will do that today.

22:07.854 --> 22:09.214
<i>Can you do that today?</i>

22:09.334 --> 22:11.574
Yeah. Yes.
I will do that today.

22:11.694 --> 22:13.094
- How's Mimi?
- <i>Well, I've got to go.</i>

22:13.174 --> 22:14.934
Oh, okay. All right.
Bye.

22:15.054 --> 22:15.894
<i>Bye. Thanks.</i>

22:16.014 --> 22:17.494
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

22:19.214 --> 22:22.934
Well,
it's none of my business,

22:23.054 --> 22:25.934
but I thought
she was very unreasonable.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.814
Catherine manages to put me
on the back foot from "hello."

22:29.934 --> 22:31.894
It's extraordinary skill.

22:37.214 --> 22:38.654
Do you like taster menus?

22:38.774 --> 22:40.014
- I'm not sure.
- I do.

22:40.094 --> 22:43.414
I think when they're good,
they're really good.

22:43.494 --> 22:46.054
And when it's not done well,
it's very frustrating.

22:57.774 --> 23:00.494
There we have some
little canapes to begin with

23:00.574 --> 23:04.134
with a duet of tapioca-based
crackers, spiced popcorn,

23:04.214 --> 23:06.894
and the lollipops are made
out of duck fat with peanuts.

23:07.014 --> 23:08.094
Thank you very much.

23:08.214 --> 23:10.454
Check on two covers,
lunch menu, please.

23:10.574 --> 23:13.574
That's a big piece of popcorn,
isn't it?

23:13.654 --> 23:14.614
It's very nice.

23:20.054 --> 23:20.934
I like that as well.

23:21.014 --> 23:23.214
Enormous green quaver.

23:23.294 --> 23:25.534
Duck fat lolly.
Well, why not?

23:25.654 --> 23:26.494
It's just like my comedy.

23:26.614 --> 23:27.814
It's, like... it's familiar...

23:27.894 --> 23:29.094
like, we all know
what a lolly is...

23:29.174 --> 23:30.894
but there's something
very different about it.

23:31.014 --> 23:32.294
And like lollipops,

23:32.374 --> 23:34.414
it's something that we enjoyed
a long time ago.

23:36.174 --> 23:37.134
Mm.

23:37.254 --> 23:40.094
To begin with, we have
a nice little appetizer.

23:40.214 --> 23:43.134
We've got the liqueur
made out of the mallow leaves

23:43.254 --> 23:45.774
topped with a fizz
which is made out of ginger beer

23:45.894 --> 23:48.174
with whiskey as well as chili.

23:48.294 --> 23:51.094
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

23:51.214 --> 23:52.414
That's nice.
It's like...

23:52.534 --> 23:54.214
Tastes
of a childhood garden.

23:54.294 --> 23:56.694
Well, it's got a bit of
alcohol in it, so it tastes...

23:56.774 --> 23:59.734
Was there a lot of alcohol
in your garden as a child?

23:59.854 --> 24:00.894
I'm sorry, Rob.

24:04.214 --> 24:05.054
Everything's all right?

24:05.174 --> 24:07.134
It's lovely.
Delicious.

24:07.254 --> 24:08.534
Very different.
Very interesting.

24:08.654 --> 24:09.574
Yeah. Cheers.

24:11.894 --> 24:12.734
Mmm.

24:12.854 --> 24:14.614
It's got... it is a bit...

24:14.734 --> 24:15.574
I mean... I have to...

24:15.694 --> 24:18.454
the consistency is a bit like...

24:18.534 --> 24:21.534
is a bit like snot,
but it tastes great.

24:21.654 --> 24:23.174
They said it was delicious.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.534
What can I say?

24:25.654 --> 24:27.534
I can't get the image of snot
out of my head now.

24:28.694 --> 24:30.014
Every time I look at that,
I want to...

24:30.134 --> 24:31.174
That was lovely.
Really nice.

24:31.254 --> 24:32.654
Very nice indeed, yeah.

24:32.734 --> 24:33.934
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.254
I use my tweezers for this.

24:42.374 --> 24:44.054
There we are, gentlemen.

24:44.174 --> 24:45.694
At the bottom
of those little sacks,

24:45.814 --> 24:48.694
you've got
some diced smoked hare

24:48.814 --> 24:51.414
as well as shredded radishes

24:51.534 --> 24:54.934
covered with a very smooth
duck foie gras mousse.

24:55.054 --> 24:56.174
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

24:56.254 --> 24:57.254
Thank you very much.

24:59.094 --> 25:00.654
Mmm.
That's fantastic.

25:09.414 --> 25:12.654
So your next course is what
we call the Humphrey's pool.

25:12.774 --> 25:16.334
It's a shellfish broth made
out of mussel, clams, cockles,

25:16.414 --> 25:17.934
which are cooked
in their own juices

25:18.054 --> 25:21.014
before to be garnished
with a shredded local seaweed.

25:21.134 --> 25:23.014
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

25:23.094 --> 25:25.814
I've never eaten
a shellfish broth before.

25:27.094 --> 25:29.134
He mentioned cooking
in their own juices.

25:29.254 --> 25:31.614
Imagine that, eh?
It's a lovely thought, isn't it?

25:31.734 --> 25:33.294
Being cooked in your own juice.

25:33.414 --> 25:34.694
I'll be honest,

25:34.774 --> 25:37.294
I don't think I could muster
more than a thimbleful.

25:41.174 --> 25:42.294
Then, of course,
with this one,

25:42.414 --> 25:44.174
you've got some
little Manx Queenies,

25:44.294 --> 25:46.414
which are
baby queen scallops.

25:46.494 --> 25:49.214
They are resting
on grilled baby gem

25:49.334 --> 25:50.454
and parsnip coulis

25:50.574 --> 25:52.534
as well as a light,
creamy horseradish sauce.

25:52.654 --> 25:53.974
- Thank you.
- Lovely.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.774
Rather optimistic
to say they're resting.

25:56.854 --> 25:58.294
Their days of resting
have been and gone.

25:58.414 --> 25:59.334
They are dead.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.414
So what we'll have
at the base of the dish,

26:06.494 --> 26:10.414
we've got a goat cheese mousse
and a globe artichoke puree,

26:10.494 --> 26:11.614
and that is garnished

26:11.734 --> 26:13.694
with deep-fried
globe artichoke leaves

26:13.814 --> 26:16.414
as well as baby
Jerusalem artichoke.

26:16.534 --> 26:20.014
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

26:20.094 --> 26:22.774
Um... I don't like artichoke.
I should just say that.

26:28.214 --> 26:30.454
Drinking the wine makes me feel
quite sophisticated.

26:30.574 --> 26:32.934
A bit like, you know,
James Bond ordering a martini.

26:33.014 --> 26:34.974
I'd like a...

26:36.134 --> 26:39.854
Like a martini, shaken...
not stirred.

26:39.934 --> 26:42.574
I want it now.

26:42.654 --> 26:43.854
Don't make me wait.

26:43.974 --> 26:45.654
I'll have a vodka martini,

26:45.774 --> 26:46.814
shaken, but not stirred.

26:46.934 --> 26:48.334
I'll have a vodka martini,

26:48.454 --> 26:49.614
shaken, not stirred.

26:49.734 --> 26:51.574
- I'll have a vodka...
- I'll have a vodka...

26:51.654 --> 26:53.054
You look very worried.

26:53.174 --> 26:54.174
- So do you.
- No.

26:54.294 --> 26:55.654
You should
take a look at your face.

26:55.734 --> 26:57.974
I'll have a vodka
martini, shaken, not stirred.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.734
You look like
you're recovering from a stroke

26:59.854 --> 27:01.574
and learning how
to get mobility again.

27:01.654 --> 27:04.774
I'd like a vodka martini,
shaken, but not stirred.

27:04.854 --> 27:06.774
I can feel my legs.
It's a miracle.

27:06.854 --> 27:08.374
I'd like a vodka martini,

27:08.494 --> 27:09.934
shaken, but not stirred.

27:10.054 --> 27:12.054
I'd like a vodka martini,

27:12.174 --> 27:14.934
shaken, not stirred.

27:15.054 --> 27:17.614
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

27:17.734 --> 27:19.574
You derive just as much pleasure
from killing as I do.

27:19.694 --> 27:21.094
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

27:21.174 --> 27:22.894
you get just as much pleasure
from killing as I do.

27:23.014 --> 27:24.054
- I'm saying that bit.
- I know.

27:24.174 --> 27:25.694
When you say it,
just don't caricature it.

27:25.814 --> 27:26.694
Try and do it real.

27:26.774 --> 27:28.174
Come, come, Mr. Bond.

27:28.254 --> 27:29.454
Shut up.
Don't tell me how to act.

27:29.534 --> 27:30.694
- Well, I bloody should do.
- Why?

27:30.774 --> 27:32.214
Because sometimes
you tend to sort of,

27:32.294 --> 27:33.254
you know, crank it up a bit.

27:33.374 --> 27:36.374
Yeah, whereas you
are widely regarded

27:36.494 --> 27:38.134
as the king of understatement.

27:38.254 --> 27:39.494
All right,
I would do it like this.

27:39.574 --> 27:40.974
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

27:41.054 --> 27:42.214
you get just as much of...

27:42.294 --> 27:44.214
- Try and get the lines right.
- All right. I know.

27:44.334 --> 27:48.254
As a rule, it's more effective
if you don't fluff the line.

27:48.374 --> 27:50.214
I'll deliver it with
a nice bit of understatement.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.694
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

27:51.774 --> 27:53.494
you get just as much pleasure
from killing as I do.

27:53.614 --> 27:55.214
- That was the worst...
- Okay. All right.

27:55.334 --> 27:56.454
This is it.
This is it.

27:56.534 --> 27:57.934
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

27:58.014 --> 27:59.734
you get just as much pleasure
from killing as I do.

27:59.854 --> 28:01.254
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

28:01.334 --> 28:04.734
you get just as much pleasure
from killing as I do.

28:04.854 --> 28:06.374
Fucking yeah.

28:06.454 --> 28:08.574
No, you went up at the end
like you watch Australian soaps.

28:08.694 --> 28:09.814
Yes, did you see I did
on my face?

28:09.934 --> 28:11.334
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

28:11.414 --> 28:12.974
you get
just as much pleasure

28:13.054 --> 28:14.054
from killing as I do?

28:14.134 --> 28:15.574
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

28:15.654 --> 28:17.254
you derive just as much pleasure
from killing

28:17.334 --> 28:18.614
as I do.

28:18.734 --> 28:20.694
When I kill,
I kill for queen and country,

28:20.814 --> 28:22.334
though I admit, killing you...

28:24.414 --> 28:27.374
Come, come, Mr. Bond,
you derive just as much...

28:29.094 --> 28:31.374
Sorry, you derive just as much

28:31.454 --> 28:33.974
pleasure
from killing as I do.

28:34.094 --> 28:36.534
Hello?

28:36.654 --> 28:37.574
<i>Hi.</i>

28:37.694 --> 28:39.374
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

28:39.494 --> 28:40.654
It's me.

28:40.734 --> 28:42.014
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

28:42.134 --> 28:44.734
It's great. It's great.
I mean, yeah... yeah.

28:44.854 --> 28:45.694
<i>Where are you now?</i>

28:45.814 --> 28:46.774
I'm in L'enclume.

28:46.894 --> 28:48.054
No way.

28:48.174 --> 28:51.694
<i>Yeah, I'm at</i>
<i>the fancy-schmancy restaurant.</i>

28:51.774 --> 28:53.214
Oh, I really wanted
to go there.

28:53.334 --> 28:55.414
What's happening
with that editing thing,

28:55.534 --> 28:57.374
the job with the guy,
you know, and the...

28:57.494 --> 28:58.974
It's going really well,
I think.

28:59.094 --> 29:01.054
They gave me an assignment
in Las Vegas.

29:01.174 --> 29:04.694
Las Vegas?
What are you going there for?

29:04.814 --> 29:06.014
<i>For work.</i>
<i>I just told you.</i>

29:06.134 --> 29:07.894
To do... what are you
gonna write about?

29:08.014 --> 29:11.094
<i>I'm gonna go do</i>
<i>this really interesting piece</i>

29:11.214 --> 29:13.134
<i>on prostitutes in Vegas,</i>

29:13.254 --> 29:16.734
<i>that kind of, like, good girls</i>
<i>gone bad Vegas style story.</i>

29:16.854 --> 29:18.694
Well, what if you become
a good girl gone bad?

29:18.774 --> 29:20.454
<i>Oh, Jesus, Steve.</i>

29:20.534 --> 29:22.454
<i>What, do you think</i>
<i>I'm gonna go to Las Vegas</i>

29:22.534 --> 29:24.774
<i>and become a prostitute?</i>

29:29.174 --> 29:30.014
beep!

29:30.134 --> 29:31.854
Hey, Joe, it's dad.

29:31.974 --> 29:35.654
Just wanted to have a chat,
you know, see what's happening.

29:35.734 --> 29:38.734
So give me a call when you can,
right?

29:38.854 --> 29:40.774
Love you. Bye.

29:43.094 --> 29:45.174
- Are you all right?
- <i>Yeah, fine.</i>

29:45.294 --> 29:46.854
Yeah? All good?
Chloe okay?

29:50.534 --> 29:51.414
Hello?

29:51.534 --> 29:55.014
It's Steve Coogan. Hey.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.134
Ha-ha. Hey, Matt.
How you doing?

29:57.254 --> 29:58.414
I'm doing good, man.
How are you?

29:58.534 --> 29:59.734
Good. Good.
Yeah, great.

29:59.854 --> 30:01.614
Would you be up
for a bit of...

30:01.694 --> 30:02.814
a bit of phone sex?

30:02.934 --> 30:04.974
<i>Ah, I might be.</i>
<i>Hmm. Yeah.</i>

30:05.094 --> 30:06.734
Could I... could I... could I...

30:06.814 --> 30:09.654
could I interest you in some
rather salacious sort of...

30:09.774 --> 30:12.014
If I sort of do this Hugh Grant,
might that sort of...

30:12.134 --> 30:15.254
get you,
as it were, going, if I...

30:15.374 --> 30:18.414
<i>He doesn't do it for me.</i>

30:18.494 --> 30:21.014
<i>You know, it's like</i>
<i>I keep telling you,</i>

30:21.134 --> 30:23.094
it's like the tortoise
and the hare, all right?

30:23.214 --> 30:25.094
What, so I'm a tortoise?

30:25.214 --> 30:26.094
Great.

30:26.174 --> 30:27.254
Speaking of boiled eggs,

30:27.374 --> 30:29.254
I'm not wearing
any pajama bottoms.

30:29.374 --> 30:31.894
<i>Ah, you saucy boy.</i>

30:32.014 --> 30:34.094
Don't say "ah."

30:34.214 --> 30:35.454
You should say "ooh."

30:35.574 --> 30:36.494
<i>Fwah.</i>

30:36.574 --> 30:38.214
Yeah, "fwah."
Thank you.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.534
Someone overheard
Nick Stevens

30:39.654 --> 30:42.254
at an Endeavor meeting,
and someone brought my name up,

30:42.374 --> 30:44.294
and he said, " I wish
I'd gotten hold of Steve Coogan

30:44.414 --> 30:45.654
when he was 35."

30:45.774 --> 30:48.414
I mean, I was...

30:48.534 --> 30:51.374
I thought, " Crikey, is that it?
Is it game over?"

30:51.454 --> 30:53.294
I mean, I'm 41.

30:53.374 --> 30:54.494
You're not 41.

30:54.614 --> 30:56.334
I'm not. No.
I'm 44.

30:56.414 --> 30:57.534
I've been 41 for three years.

30:57.654 --> 30:59.374
I've been telling people
I'm 41 for three years.

30:59.454 --> 31:02.974
You get yourself off
to Noddington,

31:03.094 --> 31:07.894
and I shall bed down here
with a rock as my pillow,

31:08.014 --> 31:10.174
the stars as my canopy,

31:10.294 --> 31:14.614
and this local barmaid
as my duvet.

31:16.694 --> 31:17.894
I like the way
you laugh at that

31:17.974 --> 31:19.374
like it's not a possibility.

31:19.454 --> 31:21.054
<i>I know it's not gonna happen.</i>

31:21.174 --> 31:22.574
What do you mean
it's not gonna happen?

31:22.654 --> 31:23.854
<i>Well, I mean, it could.</i>

31:23.934 --> 31:25.334
I pulled you.

31:25.454 --> 31:26.734
<i>It's a good time for you,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

31:26.814 --> 31:28.054
<i>It's a good time</i>
<i>to be Steve Coogan.</i>

31:28.174 --> 31:29.454
Okay, good.
That all sounds great.

31:29.534 --> 31:30.974
- <i>This is your year.</i>
- I hope so.

31:31.094 --> 31:32.894
<i>I can't do anything</i>
<i>when you're stuck over there,</i>

31:33.014 --> 31:33.854
<i>all right?</i>

31:33.974 --> 31:35.174
<i>So get your ass back here.</i>

31:35.254 --> 31:37.014
Okay, we'll do that.
Thanks for the call then.

31:37.134 --> 31:39.974
- <i>Ciao.</i>
- Okay, bye.

31:55.054 --> 31:55.894
It's incredible.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.694
Everybody wants
to work with you.

31:57.814 --> 32:00.814
I get a call from P.T. Anderson.
I get a call from Wes Anderson.

32:00.934 --> 32:04.574
Noah Baumbach, Todd Haynes,
Alexander Payne, all of them.

32:04.694 --> 32:05.574
They're all auteurs.

32:05.654 --> 32:06.894
Yeah,
and they're all geniuses,

32:07.014 --> 32:08.374
and they want to work
with the genius.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.094
I want to do
mainstream movies.

32:10.214 --> 32:13.014
Well, the Farrelly brothers
want to work with you, okay?

32:13.134 --> 32:14.534
The Scotts, Tony and Ridley,

32:14.614 --> 32:15.774
they want to do
a movie together.

32:15.894 --> 32:17.214
Never done that before.

32:17.334 --> 32:19.414
They want to do a thing with you
where it's, like, the future,

32:19.534 --> 32:21.134
but it's 500 years in the past,

32:21.214 --> 32:22.694
and you're, like,
some guy who's, like,

32:22.774 --> 32:23.654
a warrior that came...

32:23.734 --> 32:24.694
I don't even know what it is,

32:24.774 --> 32:26.414
but they want
to do it with you, okay?

32:26.534 --> 32:27.734
It's incredible.

32:27.854 --> 32:29.534
Coens, calling up.

32:29.654 --> 32:31.694
Wachowskis, both of them
want to work with you.

32:31.814 --> 32:33.854
All the brothers, my man.

32:33.974 --> 32:36.334
All the brothers
want a piece of Coogs.

32:36.414 --> 32:38.494
It's like...
I can't believe it's happening.

32:38.614 --> 32:40.494
Well, Steve, guess what.

32:40.574 --> 32:43.014
Wake up.
Smell the coffee, all right?

32:43.094 --> 32:44.694
The dream is happening
right now.

32:44.814 --> 32:46.294
You're living the dream, Steve.

32:47.374 --> 32:48.214
It's all a dream.

32:48.334 --> 32:51.654
Come back.
Wait, come back.

32:51.774 --> 32:54.934
Can't. I got a thing.
But...

32:55.054 --> 32:57.734
I don't think I'll talk to you
later, but at some point, okay?

33:11.694 --> 33:13.574
So I thought we'd take the B5278

33:13.694 --> 33:15.614
along the west bank
of Windermere.

33:15.734 --> 33:16.934
Then when we get to Rydal,

33:17.014 --> 33:19.694
we're gonna take the A591
up to Keswick.

33:19.814 --> 33:22.894
I've printed out
some reviews...

33:23.014 --> 33:24.174
Oh, great.
Oh, that's good.

33:24.254 --> 33:27.054
For L'enclume, and basically,
with L'enclume,

33:27.174 --> 33:28.334
you can say whatever you want,

33:28.414 --> 33:31.934
because it goes from
the terrible to the wonderful.

33:32.054 --> 33:34.374
Victor Lewis-Smith.

33:34.454 --> 33:37.534
"Never mind all the talk
of inventiveness and variety,

33:37.654 --> 33:40.094
"the result was as formulaic
as McDonald's

33:40.214 --> 33:43.094
"with the same splatter
of Technicolor bird shit

33:43.214 --> 33:44.494
on every plate."

33:44.574 --> 33:46.254
- Then...
- That's a bit unkind.

33:46.334 --> 33:49.174
Giles Coren in <i>The Times.</i>

33:49.294 --> 33:52.294
"Love is not strong enough
to describe what I felt

33:52.374 --> 33:53.814
"about L'enclume in Cartmel.

33:53.894 --> 33:56.814
"I am breathless
with admiration, respect,

33:56.934 --> 34:00.414
"and awe for the skill,
imagination, and restraint

34:00.534 --> 34:03.334
"of the 20-odd plates
of Simon Rogan's food

34:03.414 --> 34:05.654
that I ate in my two visits."

34:05.774 --> 34:07.054
2/3 of the way through that,

34:07.174 --> 34:09.174
you were thinking of doing
Anthony Hopkins, weren't you?

34:09.293 --> 34:10.454
- Yes.
- Yeah, I heard it.

34:10.574 --> 34:12.214
- I heard it in your voice.
- Are you glad I didn't?

34:12.333 --> 34:14.654
I am glad you didn't.
I admire your restraint.

34:14.774 --> 34:16.214
" I was dazzled,

34:16.333 --> 34:19.373
"blown away by the originality,
integrity, and extravagance.

34:19.494 --> 34:22.333
"I found it the best restaurant
experience over the years.

34:22.454 --> 34:24.853
Love is not strong enough to
describe what I felt about it!"

34:24.974 --> 34:26.174
Please, Christ.

34:26.293 --> 34:28.174
Restaurant I would easily
promise to honor and obey!

34:28.293 --> 34:29.534
I will honor you, sir!

34:29.654 --> 34:31.054
I will honor you
and the restaurant, sir!

34:31.174 --> 34:34.893
No, sir! No, sir!
I shall not, ah!

34:35.014 --> 34:37.014
I'm breathless
with admiration and respect...

34:37.134 --> 34:38.494
All right. All right.
Jesus Christ.

34:38.614 --> 34:40.014
It's so early,
shouting like that.

34:40.134 --> 34:43.094
It's really horrible.
It's really unpleasant.

34:43.214 --> 34:44.734
Well, he is when he does that,
isn't he?

34:44.853 --> 34:47.574
I know. I know.
He is, and by default, you are.

34:47.694 --> 34:50.534
Well, yeah,
because I inhabit the role, sir.

34:50.614 --> 34:52.614
I'm not a turn, am I?
I inhabit the role.

34:52.694 --> 34:54.134
Yeah, no,
you're a real method actor.

34:54.254 --> 34:55.254
Yeah.

34:55.373 --> 34:56.774
You're right up there
with Pacino and...

34:56.893 --> 34:58.374
Oh, Christ,
I better be careful what I say.

34:58.494 --> 34:59.654
What do you got?

34:59.734 --> 35:05.134
Hello, hello,
there's method in my madness.

35:17.174 --> 35:18.774
Why are we self-catering?

35:18.894 --> 35:22.414
We thought we would go
and stay the night at Greta Hall

35:22.534 --> 35:25.254
when Mischa was gonna come
with me originally,

35:25.334 --> 35:27.614
because we thought
we could make love in the bed

35:27.734 --> 35:31.854
that Coleridge slept in
and made love in

35:31.934 --> 35:36.774
and that it would lend
a poetic, romantic frisson

35:36.854 --> 35:39.214
to our congress.

35:39.294 --> 35:42.134
Still be romantic,
just the two of us.

35:42.214 --> 35:44.334
- We can be chummy.
- Yeah, yeah, chummy.

35:44.454 --> 35:45.654
- Yeah.
- Chummy.

35:45.774 --> 35:46.894
Without the bum.

35:46.974 --> 35:49.574
- Bumless chums.
- Bumless chums.

35:51.814 --> 35:54.494
Coleridge left quite quickly
after he moved here,

35:54.614 --> 35:59.054
so Robert Southey had his wife
and Coleridge's wife

35:59.174 --> 36:02.894
and another Fricker sister
living here, plus the children,

36:02.974 --> 36:06.014
so he was the only man
looking after all these children

36:06.134 --> 36:08.214
and the wives as well.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.134
So he, you know, he had to...

36:10.254 --> 36:13.294
'Cause Coleridge was off
on his travels.

36:13.374 --> 36:15.014
Couldn't cope with
the domesticity of life.

36:15.094 --> 36:16.134
He found it very difficult.

36:16.214 --> 36:18.254
He found it very hard
to be creative.

36:18.374 --> 36:19.854
Yes, yes,

36:19.974 --> 36:21.614
there's bells ringing
all over the place here.

36:21.734 --> 36:23.254
He came back, though,
didn't he?

36:23.374 --> 36:25.294
Periodically, he would
come back and visit, uh-huh.

36:25.414 --> 36:26.694
Hmm.

36:26.774 --> 36:28.774
We don't think... well,
there isn't very much evidence

36:28.854 --> 36:30.294
that he actually had sent
any money back,

36:30.414 --> 36:31.694
which is a bit tricky.

36:31.774 --> 36:35.094
I'm very consistent
with my maintenance, Rob.

36:35.174 --> 36:36.774
Oh, no, you are.
I would never say anything.

36:36.854 --> 36:39.254
In case you wanted to draw
a parallel there.

36:39.374 --> 36:41.094
So this was Coleridge's study.

36:41.174 --> 36:42.054
Wow.

36:42.134 --> 36:43.494
And possibly his bedroom
as well.

36:43.574 --> 36:44.694
Hey.

36:44.814 --> 36:49.174
He would, like... probably had
opium in here maybe.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.454
Possibly laudanum,

36:50.574 --> 36:52.374
because that's what they
were taking at that time,

36:52.494 --> 36:54.454
initially as a painkiller,
but then perhaps he would...

36:54.574 --> 36:56.494
well, he did become
addicted to it.

37:05.774 --> 37:08.614
Oh, hey.
Look at that.

37:08.694 --> 37:09.574
See that?

37:09.654 --> 37:10.534
Beautiful.

37:10.614 --> 37:12.334
You can't paint that.

37:12.414 --> 37:13.574
Well...

37:13.654 --> 37:16.094
Well, you could,
but it'd be a bit rubbish.

37:16.214 --> 37:17.774
Probably sell it
for about 25 quid

37:17.894 --> 37:20.574
in one of the tourist shops
around here.

37:20.694 --> 37:23.214
Fuck.

37:23.334 --> 37:25.134
Why do you do that, eh?
Why?

37:25.214 --> 37:29.214
You know it's
physically impossible?

37:31.574 --> 37:33.894
My back.

37:35.454 --> 37:36.334
Are you ready to order?

37:36.414 --> 37:37.294
Yes, please.

37:37.374 --> 37:38.614
- Shall I go first?
- Yep.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.134
Could I have the scallops
to start, please?

37:41.254 --> 37:43.854
And then I'll have the pigeon
as the main course.

37:43.974 --> 37:46.374
I will have the rabbit,
please,

37:46.454 --> 37:47.694
followed by the lamb.

37:47.814 --> 37:48.894
Thank you.

37:49.014 --> 37:50.614
Nice image,
rabbit following a lamb.

37:51.414 --> 37:53.414
That's a bit weird.
Rob.

37:53.494 --> 37:54.494
A bit weird.

37:54.614 --> 37:56.574
Oh, yeah.

37:56.694 --> 37:58.214
Can we have a knife
for the butter, please,

37:58.294 --> 37:59.614
and a rolled-up £20 note
for the salt?

37:59.734 --> 38:00.974
Thank you.

38:01.094 --> 38:02.774
Gentlemen, your wines.

38:02.894 --> 38:06.174
The Cheverny
and the Chablis Premier Cru.

38:06.294 --> 38:08.654
Ah, marvelous.

38:08.774 --> 38:09.734
Premier Cru.

38:09.814 --> 38:10.974
I know that that means
it's good.

38:11.094 --> 38:11.934
Premier Cru.

38:12.054 --> 38:13.934
Premier, first, the best.

38:14.014 --> 38:17.214
Cru?

38:17.334 --> 38:18.174
Don't know.

38:19.894 --> 38:21.934
Mystery. Mystery.
But that's good.

38:22.054 --> 38:23.694
It's good to have mystery
about these things.

38:23.774 --> 38:27.614
It's a premier. That's good.
It's the first of something.

38:27.734 --> 38:30.894
Okay, service.
Table six, scallops.

38:30.974 --> 38:32.974
Lovely.

38:33.094 --> 38:34.534
This is Hazlett on Coleridge.

38:34.654 --> 38:39.894
"All that he had done of moment
he had done 20 years ago.

38:39.974 --> 38:41.654
"Since then, he maybe is said

38:41.774 --> 38:43.654
"to live on the sound
of his own voice.

38:43.774 --> 38:45.534
He is a general lover
of art and science."

38:45.654 --> 38:46.574
That's true.

38:46.654 --> 38:48.174
"And wedded to no one
in particular."

38:48.294 --> 38:51.134
Okay, it's about me.
I didn't realize, but carry on.

38:51.254 --> 38:53.134
" He pursues knowledge
as a mistress."

38:53.254 --> 38:54.494
Okay.

38:54.614 --> 38:56.654
" It was not to be supposed
that Mr. Coleridge could keep on

38:56.774 --> 38:57.894
"at the rate he set off.

38:57.974 --> 38:58.974
"A-ha.

38:59.094 --> 39:00.534
He could not realize all"...

39:00.654 --> 39:01.774
Is that written down?

39:01.894 --> 39:04.094
" And less could not fix
his desultory ambition.

39:04.214 --> 39:08.014
Other stimulants
supplied the place"...

39:08.134 --> 39:09.934
Careful, you were going
to Jimmy Saville then,

39:10.054 --> 39:11.374
but I'll let it go.

39:11.494 --> 39:15.774
" Other stimulants supplied
the place and kept up

39:15.894 --> 39:18.894
"the intoxicating dream,
the fever, and the madness

39:19.014 --> 39:21.734
of his early impressions."

39:21.814 --> 39:24.054
Right.
I don't do impressions.

39:24.174 --> 39:27.774
I'm saying that it can be hard
to have a big success.

39:27.894 --> 39:31.654
Bob Balaban said, " Never be hot.
Always be warm."

39:31.774 --> 39:34.094
And a lot of the people that are
thought of as great had...

39:35.214 --> 39:36.334
supernova moments.

39:36.414 --> 39:37.614
Where do you go from there?

39:37.734 --> 39:40.334
Well, it's difficult,
you know,

39:40.414 --> 39:43.054
once you've achieved greatness,
to match that.

39:43.134 --> 39:44.014
I imagine it is.

39:44.134 --> 39:46.414
Yeah,
and you'll always imagine,

39:46.534 --> 39:47.774
because it's not a problem

39:47.894 --> 39:49.054
you'll ever have
to contend with.

39:49.174 --> 39:50.654
But that's not
a problem for me, why?

39:50.774 --> 39:52.174
I'd rather be me than you,

39:52.254 --> 39:55.774
because I'd rather have
these moments of genius

39:55.894 --> 40:01.534
than a lifetime of mediocrity.

40:01.654 --> 40:04.014
My career is not mediocre.

40:04.134 --> 40:07.374
Doesn't matter
about the thyme.

40:07.454 --> 40:08.654
- Scallops.
- Thank you very much.

40:08.734 --> 40:10.654
Thank you.

40:10.774 --> 40:12.174
Golly. Thank you.

40:14.054 --> 40:15.214
I always think of Coleridge

40:15.334 --> 40:17.334
as sort of a Richard Burton
type character.

40:17.454 --> 40:20.254
In Xanadu did Kubla Kahn

40:20.374 --> 40:22.494
a stately pleasure-dome decree

40:22.614 --> 40:24.534
where Alph,
the sacred river, ran

40:24.654 --> 40:30.414
through caverns measureless
to man down to a soundless sea.

40:30.534 --> 40:31.574
I'm very impressed with that.

40:31.694 --> 40:33.214
You shocked me,
'cause I would have thought

40:33.334 --> 40:34.894
that you would have preferred

40:35.014 --> 40:38.134
Olivia Newton-John's
version of <i>Xanadu.</i>

40:38.254 --> 40:40.694
I think both Newton-John
and Coleridge

40:40.814 --> 40:44.014
tackled the subject of Xanadu
with varying degrees of success.

40:44.134 --> 40:46.734
They call it Xanadu.

40:46.814 --> 40:47.774
Yes.

40:47.894 --> 40:49.014
Xanadu.

40:49.134 --> 40:51.374
Xaaaanadu.

40:51.454 --> 40:53.134
In Xanadu.

40:53.214 --> 40:54.654
First one, pigeon,
lamb encore,

40:54.774 --> 40:56.334
followed by duck, lamb encore.

41:03.614 --> 41:04.654
Thank you.

41:04.774 --> 41:06.894
Golly, that does look nice.

41:06.974 --> 41:08.134
That looks lovely.
What is that?

41:08.214 --> 41:09.294
- Pigeon.
- Really?

41:09.414 --> 41:10.374
Yeah.

41:12.774 --> 41:13.614
Mmm.

41:13.734 --> 41:15.494
It's a little like haggis.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.374
Yeah?

41:17.494 --> 41:19.254
Anyone ever asks you
to go on a haggis hunt,

41:19.374 --> 41:20.974
be careful what you say.

41:21.094 --> 41:22.574
They've taken you for a fool.

41:22.694 --> 41:25.574
Taken you for a fool.

41:25.654 --> 41:27.534
As a bloody fool.

41:27.654 --> 41:29.454
There's no such thing
as a haggis hunt.

41:34.974 --> 41:37.054
I just imagined myself
pointing my knife upside down

41:37.174 --> 41:40.374
and just pressing my head
onto it.

41:40.494 --> 41:42.134
Desperate to be
taken seriously, aren't you?

41:42.254 --> 41:43.534
No.

41:43.654 --> 41:46.934
You can't treat your entire life
like a Radio 4 panel show.

41:47.054 --> 41:50.254
Buzz.
Yes, you can.

41:50.334 --> 41:55.374
Alex James said he celebrated
his 20th birthday with alcohol,

41:55.454 --> 41:59.574
his 30th with drugs,
and his 40th with food.

41:59.694 --> 42:00.934
Is that how it is for you?

42:01.014 --> 42:04.174
Um...

42:04.254 --> 42:06.214
Well, don't you find
it exhausting,

42:06.294 --> 42:09.854
still running around, going
to parties and chasing girls...

42:09.974 --> 42:11.254
I don't run around
and go to parties.

42:11.374 --> 42:12.614
I don't run around
and chase girls.

42:12.694 --> 42:13.614
You do.

42:13.694 --> 42:14.854
- No, I don't...
- You chase girls.

42:14.934 --> 42:15.814
I don't chase them.

42:15.894 --> 42:17.134
You make me sound
like Benny Hill.

42:17.214 --> 42:19.294
But don't you find all that
exhausting at your age?

42:19.414 --> 42:20.494
No.

42:20.614 --> 42:22.254
Do you find it exhausting
looking after a baby?

42:22.334 --> 42:23.574
Yes, I do.

42:23.694 --> 42:26.294
Yeah, well...

42:26.414 --> 42:28.774
everything's exhausting
when you're past 40.

42:31.774 --> 42:33.254
Everything's exhausting
at our age.

42:42.574 --> 42:43.814
Hi, Emma.

42:43.894 --> 42:45.054
<i>Hey, are you all right?</i>

42:45.174 --> 42:46.494
Yeah, I got a missed call.

42:46.614 --> 42:47.934
<i>Yeah, I was just phoning</i>

42:48.054 --> 42:49.734
to remind you
about the photographer.

42:49.814 --> 42:51.534
She's gonna meet you
at Hipping Hall tomorrow.

42:51.654 --> 42:54.334
Okay. Well... hang on.
A photographer?

42:54.454 --> 42:57.094
<i>Yeah, for the photos</i>
<i>for the article.</i>

42:57.174 --> 42:59.294
<i>We talked about it</i>
<i>in the office, remember?</i>

42:59.414 --> 43:00.534
<i>Yeah, it's on my itinerary.</i>

43:00.654 --> 43:01.854
Okay, yeah. Okay.

43:01.974 --> 43:04.334
<i>Her name's Yolanda,</i>
<i>by the way.</i>

43:04.454 --> 43:06.854
And I'm gonna come up with her
tomorrow, so you'll see me then.

43:06.974 --> 43:08.414
Oh, so I'll see you
tomorrow then, yeah?

43:08.534 --> 43:09.774
<i>Yeah, see you tomorrow.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

43:09.894 --> 43:10.734
- Good.
- <i>Take care.</i>

43:10.854 --> 43:11.814
Okay, bye. Bye.

43:18.534 --> 43:20.614
A-ha!

43:23.814 --> 43:26.134
This is Langdale.

43:26.254 --> 43:27.574
You know what that means?

43:27.694 --> 43:30.094
It means "long valley"
in Viking.

43:30.214 --> 43:32.614
- This would have...
- Oh!

43:32.694 --> 43:34.734
All this was formed
in the last ice age,

43:34.854 --> 43:36.494
about 10,000 years ago.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.174
Incredible, isn't it?

43:38.294 --> 43:41.334
How far are we gonna go?

43:41.454 --> 43:42.294
A little bit further.

43:42.414 --> 43:43.254
Because it's late.

43:43.374 --> 43:44.574
I know. I know.

43:44.694 --> 43:46.574
As you can see, the sun is now
on the other side of the...

43:46.654 --> 43:48.214
- Hello.
- It's okay. Hello.

43:48.334 --> 43:53.374
Human history has been recorded
for, what, 3,000 years?

43:53.494 --> 43:57.054
and yet, you know, right now,
we're in a warm period,

43:57.174 --> 43:59.294
but there's gonna be another
ice age very soon,

43:59.414 --> 44:01.454
in about, say,
another 3,000 years,

44:01.574 --> 44:03.294
but that's the blink of an eye.

44:03.414 --> 44:07.014
The rocks here were formed
400 million years ago.

44:07.094 --> 44:08.494
400 million years ago.

44:08.574 --> 44:10.414
It's like... where we are now,

44:10.534 --> 44:13.054
this was a huge
volcanic caldera.

44:13.174 --> 44:15.734
This was a volcanic lake
of molten volcano,

44:15.854 --> 44:17.654
and it was on a land mass
called Avalonia

44:17.774 --> 44:20.134
that drifted from the South Pole
all the way to where we are now

44:20.254 --> 44:21.654
over sort of hundreds
of million years.

44:21.774 --> 44:23.854
We shouldn't probably
go much further

44:23.974 --> 44:25.414
just because of the light.

44:35.254 --> 44:37.934
It's... isn't that beautiful,
that?

44:38.054 --> 44:39.894
Yeah.

44:40.014 --> 44:43.054
I think it almost is
more beautiful in the mist.

44:45.214 --> 44:49.054
It's like a...
It's like a Turner painting.

45:11.254 --> 45:13.134
Let me get two tickets
for Dove Cottage.

45:13.214 --> 45:18.094
I'm really sorry, sir,
but the last admission is 5:00.

45:18.214 --> 45:22.774
Right, okay, well,
it's five past.

45:22.894 --> 45:24.734
I'm really sorry, sir,
but these are the rules.

45:24.854 --> 45:25.934
We'll be very quick.

45:26.054 --> 45:29.494
Yes, I know, but that
really wouldn't be fair

45:29.614 --> 45:30.814
on all the other latecomers.

45:30.934 --> 45:32.694
What other latecomers?
I can't see anyone.

45:32.814 --> 45:34.574
No, I know.
Not at the moment, but...

45:34.654 --> 45:36.574
Please?
We've come from London.

45:36.694 --> 45:37.854
Why didn't you come earlier?

45:37.974 --> 45:41.374
Well, that's... because I got
stuck in traffic.

45:41.494 --> 45:42.454
Well, I'm really sorry.

45:42.574 --> 45:43.934
Perhaps you could
come back tomorrow.

45:44.054 --> 45:46.054
- I can't come back tomorrow.
- Is this man troubling you?

45:46.134 --> 45:48.134
What are you doing?
Honestly.

45:48.254 --> 45:49.614
We just wondered
if we could pop inside

45:49.734 --> 45:51.054
and have a little look
at the cottage.

45:51.134 --> 45:52.014
Mr. Brydon?

45:52.094 --> 45:53.294
Yes, it is.

45:53.374 --> 45:54.854
It's very nice to meet you.

45:54.974 --> 45:56.494
Would you do something for me?

45:56.614 --> 45:58.734
Depends what it is.

45:58.854 --> 46:03.334
I have a grandson,
and he loves that tiny man...

46:03.414 --> 46:04.334
Small man in a box?

46:04.414 --> 46:06.094
Small man in the box
that you do.

46:06.174 --> 46:08.214
Could you sign this for him?

46:08.334 --> 46:09.174
Sure. Yeah.

46:09.294 --> 46:10.574
Thank you. Thank you.

46:10.694 --> 46:11.534
What's his name?

46:11.654 --> 46:13.454
His name is William.

46:13.574 --> 46:16.894
Well, look, I'll sign this
for William, okay, if...

46:17.014 --> 46:18.294
if my friend and I

46:18.414 --> 46:20.254
can go take a look
at Dove Cottage.

46:20.374 --> 46:21.534
What do you say?

46:21.654 --> 46:24.254
I don't understand that.

46:26.054 --> 46:28.094
Why do people
have to be like that?

46:28.214 --> 46:30.254
She wasn't being
like anything.

46:30.374 --> 46:32.534
It is only open
for another half an hour,

46:32.654 --> 46:36.374
and that woman, in all fairness,
is probably bereaved.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.734
Yeah, but why... it's not
my fault her husband's dead.

46:38.814 --> 46:40.614
No, but you...

46:40.694 --> 46:42.894
Old people, at some time...
not all old people,

46:42.974 --> 46:45.574
but a lot of them...
seek out aggravation.

46:45.654 --> 46:47.414
Oh, that's total rubbish.

46:47.534 --> 46:48.854
She was lovely.

46:50.414 --> 46:53.454
Looks not unlike yourself
in that picture.

46:56.734 --> 46:58.654
Okay, ready?
One, two...

47:12.374 --> 47:13.214
Want some?

47:13.334 --> 47:14.494
Uh, no, thank you.

47:14.614 --> 47:15.454
Sure?

47:15.574 --> 47:16.894
Absolutely.

47:17.014 --> 47:17.934
I never smoked.

47:18.054 --> 47:20.334
Mm.

47:20.454 --> 47:23.174
That's the trouble with you,
Rob.

47:23.254 --> 47:24.974
You're not open
to new experiences.

47:26.814 --> 47:30.254
I would remind you of the time
I had a Red Bull and Coke.

47:33.334 --> 47:37.454
That's not what Coleridge
would have been imbibing.

47:37.534 --> 47:39.934
He wouldn't have been having
a spliff, would he?

47:40.054 --> 47:41.894
No, he wouldn't, but I mean,
if they'd been around...

47:41.974 --> 47:43.214
He would
have definitely partaken

47:43.334 --> 47:44.454
if they'd have been around.

47:44.534 --> 47:46.254
If you really want
to pay tribute to him,

47:46.334 --> 47:49.534
you should be having some opium.

47:49.654 --> 47:52.094
What, that's...

47:52.214 --> 47:53.454
Or its modern-day equivalent.

47:53.574 --> 47:54.534
This is... well, this is...

47:54.654 --> 47:56.254
well, no, the modern-day
equivalent of that,

47:56.374 --> 47:57.214
that's heroin.

47:57.334 --> 47:58.734
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

47:58.854 --> 48:01.454
I'm not a junkie, Rob.

48:01.574 --> 48:04.094
I'm not encouraging you
to become hooked on heroin.

48:04.214 --> 48:05.054
I'm just saying...

48:05.174 --> 48:06.254
It sounds like you are.

48:06.374 --> 48:07.414
I'm not.
Why would I do that?

48:07.534 --> 48:09.494
I don't know.
For a laugh.

48:09.614 --> 48:11.214
Ha-ha.
It was a hell of a laugh.

48:11.334 --> 48:14.054
You know Steve?
You seen Steve lately?

48:14.134 --> 48:15.334
He's living
at the council estate

48:15.414 --> 48:16.494
curled up in his own shit.

48:16.574 --> 48:18.254
Aye.
That was my doing, that was.

48:18.374 --> 48:19.814
I suggested he try heroin.

48:19.894 --> 48:21.934
Cracking idea.

48:22.054 --> 48:23.014
I would never do that.

48:28.894 --> 48:34.374
Most creative... the most
creative people smoke, you know,

48:34.454 --> 48:36.454
smoke marijuana, smoke hash.

48:50.134 --> 48:51.414
Are you Steve Coogan?

48:51.534 --> 48:52.374
Yes, I am.

48:52.494 --> 48:53.694
A-ha!

48:53.814 --> 48:55.254
A-ha.

48:55.374 --> 48:57.014
- All right, man. How you doing?
- Fine, thanks.

48:57.134 --> 48:58.494
Yeah, listen, do us a favor,
would you?

48:58.614 --> 48:59.574
Will you sign that?

48:59.694 --> 49:00.974
- Yes, of course.
- Make it out to Paul.

49:01.094 --> 49:03.014
Okay.

49:03.094 --> 49:05.294
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, of course, absolutely.

49:05.414 --> 49:07.334
Is true,
what I read about you?

49:07.454 --> 49:08.734
What do you read about me?

49:08.854 --> 49:11.694
That you're a bit of a cunt.

49:11.774 --> 49:12.974
Well, where did you read that?

49:13.054 --> 49:15.814
It's in today's newspaper.
Here, look.

49:17.454 --> 49:20.254
Uh, whoever said that
doesn't know me very well.

49:20.374 --> 49:21.774
Are you sure?

49:26.454 --> 49:27.414
What?

49:27.534 --> 49:29.294
"Coogan is a cunt says dad."

49:30.614 --> 49:31.574
"Cunt"?

49:43.494 --> 49:46.454
Did you not sleep well
or something?

49:46.574 --> 49:47.694
No.

49:47.774 --> 49:50.054
I couldn't get off
'cause of the food,

49:50.134 --> 49:51.174
and then when I did get off,

49:51.294 --> 49:54.894
I was having awful dreams,
really bad dreams.

49:55.014 --> 49:56.414
Blue cheese.

49:56.534 --> 49:59.134
Coleridge was a poor sleeper.

49:59.254 --> 50:04.614
I was reading his poem
called <i>The Pains of Sleep.</i>

50:04.694 --> 50:06.974
"Sleep, the wide blessing,

50:07.094 --> 50:10.294
"seemed to me distemper's
worst calamity.

50:10.414 --> 50:13.974
"The third night, when my own
loud scream had waked me

50:14.094 --> 50:15.494
"from the fiendish dream,

50:15.614 --> 50:19.134
"o'ercome with sufferings
strange and wild,

50:19.254 --> 50:22.214
I wept as I had been a child."

50:22.294 --> 50:24.574
Yes.
Oh, I know that.

50:24.694 --> 50:25.854
That's the drugs.

50:25.974 --> 50:26.814
What?

50:26.934 --> 50:27.854
Coleridge. The opium.

50:27.974 --> 50:29.574
He was a big druggie.

50:29.654 --> 50:31.054
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

50:35.454 --> 50:37.894
You could have a costume drama
here, couldn't you?

50:37.974 --> 50:39.294
I would...

50:39.414 --> 50:40.814
Mel Gibson coming over
the hill.

50:40.934 --> 50:43.294
I would just love to do
a costume drama in these hills,

50:43.414 --> 50:46.134
just leaping, vaulting over
dry stone walls with a scabbard.

50:46.254 --> 50:47.694
This, like, dead look in my eyes

50:47.814 --> 50:50.694
'cause I've seen so many horrors
that I'm just immune to it.

50:50.774 --> 50:52.094
And they always say
something like,

50:52.214 --> 50:53.734
Gentlemen, to bed.

50:53.814 --> 50:56.974
Gentlemen, to bed,
for we leave at first light.

50:57.094 --> 51:02.014
Tomorrow we battle,
and we may lose our lives,

51:02.134 --> 51:06.254
but remember,
death is but a moment.

51:06.374 --> 51:08.294
Cowardice is a lifetime
of affliction.

51:08.374 --> 51:09.374
Nice.

51:09.494 --> 51:12.894
To bed,
for we rise at daybreak!

51:13.014 --> 51:15.174
Very good. Very good.
Very impressive.

51:15.254 --> 51:16.174
Always leave at daybreak.

51:16.294 --> 51:20.694
No, they never leave at,
you know, 9:30.

51:20.814 --> 51:22.334
Gentlemen, to bed,

51:22.454 --> 51:23.294
for we leave at 9:30.

51:23.414 --> 51:24.854
- Ish.
- Ish.

51:24.974 --> 51:28.774
Gentlemen, to bed,
for we rise at...

51:28.894 --> 51:30.894
What time is the battle?

51:31.014 --> 51:32.734
It's about, oh, 12:00?

51:32.854 --> 51:34.134
Right, 12:00.

51:34.254 --> 51:37.854
That's about, on horseback,
about three hours or something.

51:37.974 --> 51:42.454
So we leave about 8:00, 8:30?

51:42.574 --> 51:44.654
- 8:30 for 9:00.
- Yes.

51:44.734 --> 51:48.534
Gentlemen, to bed,
for we leave at 8:30 for 9:00,

51:48.654 --> 51:52.854
and we rise at just after day...
7:30, so just after daybreak.

51:52.974 --> 51:57.214
Gentlemen, to bed, for we leave
at 9:30 on the dot.

51:57.334 --> 51:58.774
On the dot.

51:58.894 --> 52:00.614
Do you want to have a run,
sire, in the morning?

52:00.694 --> 52:03.054
- Yes. Yes.
- To loosen up, sire.

52:03.134 --> 52:04.734
You know the other thing
they never say is...

52:04.854 --> 52:06.214
Right, well,

52:06.294 --> 52:07.534
we'd better make a move.

52:07.614 --> 52:11.294
I want to get back in daylight.
We'd better make a move.

52:11.374 --> 52:15.414
To bed. Tomorrow we rise.
We leave at 10:00-ish.

52:15.534 --> 52:20.014
But now to bed, unless you are
one of those people, like me,

52:20.134 --> 52:24.014
who finds it very hard to get
off after he's eaten cheese,

52:24.134 --> 52:27.174
in which case,
stay awhile by the fire,

52:27.254 --> 52:28.974
talk of battles past and old,

52:29.094 --> 52:34.254
and then and only then, sire,
go thee to bed.

52:34.334 --> 52:35.894
And sleep well.

52:36.014 --> 52:38.134
Sleep the sleep
of 1,000 martyrs.

52:38.254 --> 52:39.774
Sleep well, my brother.

52:39.894 --> 52:41.534
Sleep well, my sister.

52:41.654 --> 52:43.934
Sleep with my sister.

52:44.014 --> 52:44.934
Sleep well, my brother.

52:45.014 --> 52:46.254
Sleep well, my sister,
but please,

52:46.374 --> 52:47.694
do not sleep with my sister.

52:47.814 --> 52:50.014
Leave my sister out of it,
all right?

52:50.134 --> 52:51.214
Leave my sister alone.

52:51.294 --> 52:53.494
Don't touch her.

52:53.614 --> 52:56.894
Gentlemen, to bed,
for at daybreak, I will...

52:57.014 --> 52:58.094
Breakfast.

52:58.214 --> 52:59.054
We will breakfast.

52:59.174 --> 53:00.134
- Sire, sire.
- Yes?

53:00.214 --> 53:02.094
'T is a continental breakfast.

53:02.214 --> 53:04.374
'Twill only take
20 minutes, max.

53:04.494 --> 53:06.774
Thank you, Brother Rob.

53:06.894 --> 53:08.494
Brother Rob?
Don't call me Brother Rob.

53:08.574 --> 53:10.534
- I'd be Brother Jed.
- No, no, no.

53:10.654 --> 53:13.454
Have you seen <i>Rob Roy?</i>
Liam Neeson in a kilt.

53:13.574 --> 53:14.894
Of course you
could be called Rob.

53:14.974 --> 53:16.574
Brother, tomorrow,

53:16.654 --> 53:18.054
tomorrow we shall
have breakfast.

53:18.134 --> 53:21.774
We shall rise at 9:00, and we
shall head off tomorrow morning.

53:21.894 --> 53:24.254
Thank you, Brother Rob.

53:24.334 --> 53:25.214
And let me say this.

53:25.294 --> 53:26.174
Look into my eyes.

53:26.254 --> 53:28.254
You are my brother,

53:28.374 --> 53:31.214
and you sound a bit
like Billy Connolly.

53:31.334 --> 53:35.694
I know.
I know. I can't help it.

53:35.814 --> 53:37.054
Gentlemen, to bed,

53:37.174 --> 53:39.254
for tomorrow we rise
at daybreak.

53:39.374 --> 53:40.534
We rise at daybreak.

53:40.654 --> 53:43.494
Why do they do that?
They always rise at daybreak.

54:08.894 --> 54:11.014
They'd always... their
expressions would really match...

54:11.094 --> 54:12.574
# Dee-ba dee
bop bop bop ba-dah #

54:12.694 --> 54:15.414
Yeah, big, open-face.
Happy faces.

54:15.534 --> 54:18.054
# Ooh, ba-da, bop bop ba #

54:18.134 --> 54:19.054
It was nice.

54:19.134 --> 54:20.614
It was a very un-cynical
kind of music.

54:20.734 --> 54:23.614
I miss it.
I really miss it.

54:31.494 --> 54:32.334
Hello.

54:32.454 --> 54:33.694
- Hey, you all right?
- Yes.

54:33.814 --> 54:35.214
This is Yolanda,
the photographer.

54:35.334 --> 54:36.174
- Hi.
- This is Steve.

54:36.294 --> 54:39.374
Nice to meet you.

54:39.494 --> 54:40.694
- Rob.
- Hi.

54:40.814 --> 54:42.054
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

54:42.134 --> 54:43.054
Hi, Emma.
How are you?

54:43.134 --> 54:44.334
I'm very good.
Are you all right?

54:44.414 --> 54:46.534
Hello.

54:46.614 --> 54:47.614
Good.

54:47.734 --> 54:49.134
Don't do that.
That's very funny.

54:49.214 --> 54:50.734
Yeah, there's been none
of that on the trip.

54:50.854 --> 54:52.014
No, none of that.
Heavy petting.

54:52.134 --> 54:53.814
- Heavy petting.
- We draw the line.

54:53.934 --> 54:54.774
Pass the time somehow.

54:54.894 --> 54:56.294
But no penetration.

54:56.374 --> 54:58.134
- Very good.
- Absolutely.

54:58.254 --> 55:01.694
Okay, it's just up here,
and I looked at all the rooms,

55:01.814 --> 55:03.054
and yours is the nicest.

55:03.174 --> 55:04.774
Good. Good.

55:04.854 --> 55:07.254
What's Rob's room like?

55:07.374 --> 55:08.334
It's nice. It's nice.

55:08.454 --> 55:10.214
It's not as big as yours,
but, yeah.

55:10.294 --> 55:12.334
Great.

55:12.454 --> 55:13.734
There you go.

55:13.814 --> 55:15.894
Oh, very nice.
Very beige.

55:16.014 --> 55:17.054
Yeah, well, yeah.

55:17.174 --> 55:18.494
The bathroom's through there.

55:18.574 --> 55:20.254
There's, like,
a little study area,

55:20.374 --> 55:21.974
and, yeah, it's all right.

55:22.094 --> 55:23.374
Great. Great.

55:23.494 --> 55:25.534
All right.

55:25.654 --> 55:28.534
Listen, have I met
Yolanda before?

55:28.654 --> 55:31.814
I don't know.
Maybe before my time maybe.

55:31.894 --> 55:34.734
We need to get some sort
of a system going, you know,

55:34.814 --> 55:36.934
about who I've met before
and who I haven't,

55:37.014 --> 55:38.294
because they remember
meeting me,

55:38.414 --> 55:39.654
and I don't remember
meeting them,

55:39.734 --> 55:41.054
so that can get embarrassing.

55:41.174 --> 55:43.014
- Do you want me to ask her?
- No, no, no. Don't ask her.

55:43.094 --> 55:44.014
Okay. Okay.

55:44.134 --> 55:47.054
Just see if
she mentions anything.

55:47.174 --> 55:48.014
Right. Okay.

55:49.574 --> 55:51.494
So is this all right?
Look okay?

55:51.614 --> 55:52.574
Yeah, you look nice, yeah.

55:52.694 --> 55:54.094
Look a bit like that guy
off <i>Top Gear.</i>

55:54.214 --> 55:55.254
What, Jeremy Clarkson?

55:55.374 --> 55:56.814
No, no, no, the other one.

55:56.934 --> 55:57.774
Oh, Richard Hammond?

55:57.894 --> 55:59.814
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's worse.

55:59.934 --> 56:00.934
Well...

56:23.574 --> 56:25.774
So how has the trip been
so far?

56:25.854 --> 56:26.854
Rob?

56:26.934 --> 56:28.334
I can honestly say

56:28.454 --> 56:31.494
it's one of the most enjoyable
periods of my life.

56:33.254 --> 56:35.694
Yolanda,
do you know who that is?

56:35.814 --> 56:37.934
No, I don't.

56:43.374 --> 56:44.734
Okay, who's this?
Ready? Who's this?

56:44.854 --> 56:48.134
She was only...
She was only 15 years old.

56:48.254 --> 56:50.854
She was only 15 years old.

56:50.934 --> 56:54.094
She was only 15... listen
to the sound of the voice.

56:54.174 --> 56:56.294
I'll give you a clue.
It's not a Muppet.

56:57.334 --> 56:58.974
That's all I'm saying.

56:59.094 --> 57:01.134
She was only 15 years old.

57:01.254 --> 57:03.614
You're a big man,
but you're out of shape.

57:03.734 --> 57:04.814
Right, but nowadays, he's...

57:04.894 --> 57:06.774
Right, now, this is how
he sounds now.

57:06.894 --> 57:08.254
The voice has gone...

57:08.334 --> 57:11.134
Shall I prepare the Batmobile,
Master Wayne?

57:11.214 --> 57:13.214
That is how he talks now.
Right?

57:13.334 --> 57:15.414
I've just been to do
an <i>Italian Job</i>

57:15.534 --> 57:17.054
with <i>Hannah and Her Sisters.</i>

57:17.174 --> 57:19.814
On the way,
I had a bit of a <i>Zulu,</i>

57:19.894 --> 57:21.294
so I had to pop to the loo,

57:21.374 --> 57:25.254
and then, then, I...
I...

57:25.334 --> 57:26.854
Not a lot of people know...

57:26.934 --> 57:28.174
You know that?

57:28.254 --> 57:30.214
- It sounds so familiar.
- He's an international star.

57:30.294 --> 57:32.934
But I really... the thing is,
is it an actor?

57:33.014 --> 57:34.214
Yes.

57:34.294 --> 57:35.894
No, he's the man who comes
and does my boiler.

57:36.014 --> 57:37.494
Yes, he's an actor.

57:37.614 --> 57:40.134
He might as well be the guy
who comes and does his boiler.

57:40.214 --> 57:42.694
Because if he is an actor,
in Spain, they dub the films,

57:42.814 --> 57:43.694
so I really...

57:43.774 --> 57:44.734
Oh, they... okay.

57:44.814 --> 57:46.334
What, they dub the films?

57:48.334 --> 57:49.214
Here we go.

57:51.774 --> 57:53.454
Not a lot of people...

57:53.574 --> 57:54.894
- That's not my accent.
- No, it's not.

57:54.974 --> 57:57.414
No, no,
it's a rough approximation.

57:57.494 --> 58:00.614
Do you like that racist
generalized interpretation

58:00.694 --> 58:01.574
of Spanish?

58:03.134 --> 58:04.454
Such an ass.

58:04.534 --> 58:06.534
Right, ready, here's a clue.
This might give it to you.

58:06.614 --> 58:09.094
My name is Michael Caine.

58:09.174 --> 58:10.614
Okay. All right. Yeah.

58:10.734 --> 58:11.654
- Who is it?
- Michael Caine.

58:11.774 --> 58:12.654
Michael Caine.

58:12.734 --> 58:13.934
Hey, wow.

58:14.054 --> 58:16.214
Rob's was
a very entertaining version,

58:16.334 --> 58:19.574
but I don't think...
I don't think it was as accurate

58:19.694 --> 58:21.774
as mine.

58:21.894 --> 58:25.134
She was only 15...
She was only 15 years old.

58:25.254 --> 58:26.694
You're getting Michael Caine
in stereo.

58:26.774 --> 58:29.414
- She was only 15...
- She was only 15 years old.

58:29.494 --> 58:32.494
You were only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off.

58:32.614 --> 58:35.494
She was only 15 years old.

58:35.574 --> 58:37.334
Oh, my God.

58:37.454 --> 58:40.094
Yeah, I do recognize him now.

58:40.174 --> 58:42.414
Excellent.
Let's move on. Good.

58:47.374 --> 58:49.174
Oh, wow.
Thank you very much.

58:50.654 --> 58:54.414
I was thinking I could take
the photographs up in the hills.

58:54.494 --> 58:56.654
I saw a place when I was coming,
very nice.

58:56.774 --> 58:58.374
Oh, right.
Okay, yes. A lone walker.

58:58.454 --> 59:00.174
Wandered lonely as a cloud.

59:00.254 --> 59:02.574
Yeah, well, that sounds
a bit like I'm lonely.

59:02.654 --> 59:03.854
You gonna change your clothes?

59:03.974 --> 59:05.134
Again?

59:05.214 --> 59:06.574
Well, actually...

59:06.694 --> 59:07.934
I wouldn't wear that
in the hills.

59:08.014 --> 59:08.894
No, you're right.

59:08.974 --> 59:10.014
I've got proper walking gear.

59:10.094 --> 59:12.374
I've got, you know, crampons.

59:12.494 --> 59:13.894
Oh, might like to go

59:14.014 --> 59:15.494
for a nice ramble, Lyn,

59:15.574 --> 59:16.894
up Helvellyn.

59:16.974 --> 59:21.174
Lyn, Lyn, where are my crampons?

59:21.294 --> 59:25.334
Why have you brought tampons?
That's not what I said.

59:25.454 --> 59:28.214
No, you fool, crampons.

59:28.334 --> 59:29.574
Oh.

59:29.654 --> 59:30.574
That's good.

59:30.694 --> 59:31.974
You could have written
for the show,

59:32.054 --> 59:35.334
'cause it's so up there
with the best stuff.

59:35.414 --> 59:37.014
I've love to quote
your own stuff back at you,

59:37.134 --> 59:39.454
but I just don't know any.

59:39.574 --> 59:41.694
Odd, 'cause you were executive
producer on a lot of it.

59:41.774 --> 59:43.134
And I still don't know any.

59:43.254 --> 59:45.454
You never were that attentive
at work, were you?

59:52.654 --> 59:54.974
So this is it, just kind of,
you know...

59:55.054 --> 59:57.054
- Nice.
- Yeah, it's whatever.

59:57.134 --> 59:58.654
It's creamy.

59:58.774 --> 01:00:01.414
You like cream,
then you'll be happy.

01:00:01.494 --> 01:00:03.974
I guess just a little
seating area there

01:00:04.054 --> 01:00:05.854
and a bathroom.

01:00:05.934 --> 01:00:07.174
Wow.
It's very nice.

01:00:07.254 --> 01:00:08.414
Don't know why
I'm telling you.

01:00:09.614 --> 01:00:12.054
Petit four.
Why are they called petit fours?

01:00:12.174 --> 01:00:14.494
Little oven.
"Four" is French for "oven."

01:00:14.574 --> 01:00:16.094
Ah.

01:00:16.174 --> 01:00:21.614
Yolanda, did...
have we met before?

01:00:21.694 --> 01:00:22.654
Yes, we have.

01:00:22.774 --> 01:00:24.814
It was five years ago.

01:00:24.894 --> 01:00:26.774
It was a photo shoot
for <i>Time Out.</i>

01:00:26.894 --> 01:00:30.414
Right, and did we
do something afterwards?

01:00:30.534 --> 01:00:32.854
- Yes, we did.
- Okay.

01:00:32.974 --> 01:00:37.254
- You don't remember?
- No, I do remember.

01:00:37.374 --> 01:00:39.534
- How are you?
- I'm okay. I'm fine, yeah.

01:00:39.654 --> 01:00:40.974
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:00:41.094 --> 01:00:42.534
Listen, I think I'm gonna
have a line.

01:00:42.654 --> 01:00:44.134
Do you want one?

01:00:44.254 --> 01:00:45.534
- Coke?
- Yeah.

01:00:45.654 --> 01:00:46.614
No. No. No.

01:00:46.734 --> 01:00:48.494
- Do you mind if I do?
- Oh, no.

01:00:48.614 --> 01:00:50.134
Okay.

01:00:50.254 --> 01:00:52.654
There's a bathroom there
with lots of marble, so...

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.934
Okay. All right. Thank you.

01:00:55.054 --> 01:00:56.654
So they're picking clothes.

01:00:56.774 --> 01:00:58.694
He's probably wearing
the crampons now.

01:00:58.774 --> 01:01:01.134
He's up the side
of the wardrobe.

01:01:01.254 --> 01:01:03.814
What do you think?
What do you think?

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.734
Does this look good?

01:01:05.814 --> 01:01:07.334
Like Tom Cruise
in <i>Mission: Impossible II.</i>

01:01:17.014 --> 01:01:18.734
- Yolanda?
- Mm-hmm?

01:01:18.814 --> 01:01:21.174
I mean, this is kind of,
sort of, you know, outdoorsy.

01:01:21.294 --> 01:01:22.574
Bit of the Shackleton...

01:01:22.694 --> 01:01:24.494
It's a bit too bright.

01:01:24.574 --> 01:01:25.974
Well, this is
what I would wear if I was,

01:01:26.094 --> 01:01:27.454
you know, genuinely out walking.

01:01:27.534 --> 01:01:31.134
The red's just
for safety reasons, really.

01:01:31.214 --> 01:01:33.614
I've got darker stuff.
That's fine.

01:01:33.734 --> 01:01:36.214
Okay.
You sure you don't want one?

01:01:36.334 --> 01:01:38.574
No.

01:01:41.254 --> 01:01:43.214
Uh... no?

01:01:43.334 --> 01:01:45.134
No.

01:01:49.734 --> 01:01:51.774
Reminds me
of the kind of place where,

01:01:51.894 --> 01:01:53.334
like, <i>Wuthering Heights...</i>

01:01:53.454 --> 01:01:55.774
Oh, <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>
Yeah.

01:01:55.894 --> 01:01:58.894
- No, that's not far from here.
- Oh, really?

01:01:59.014 --> 01:02:01.094
Yeah,
it's the Yorkshire Moors.

01:02:01.174 --> 01:02:03.694
That's... yeah.
A place called Howarth.

01:02:03.814 --> 01:02:04.654
Oh, okay.

01:02:04.774 --> 01:02:06.494
<i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

01:02:06.574 --> 01:02:09.094
So do you think
I could play Heathcliff?

01:02:09.174 --> 01:02:10.054
Definitely.

01:02:10.134 --> 01:02:11.014
Yeah.

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.814
I'd have to me more, like...

01:02:12.894 --> 01:02:13.974
I'd like to play...

01:02:14.094 --> 01:02:15.574
I think he's, you know,
he's interesting.

01:02:15.694 --> 01:02:16.534
Very interesting.

01:02:16.654 --> 01:02:17.934
- Kind of cruel.
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:18.014 --> 01:02:23.334
Cruel, but, I don't know,
compelling, I guess, is...

01:02:23.454 --> 01:02:25.174
There is something
very attractive about him.

01:02:25.294 --> 01:02:26.574
Yeah.

01:02:26.694 --> 01:02:30.614
Think I'm a little old
to play him, but I'd like to.

01:02:30.734 --> 01:02:32.294
Are you sad
not to be in the picture?

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.294
I'm a tiny bit hurt
that he didn't want me to,

01:02:34.414 --> 01:02:36.814
but I'm only saying that
because it's you.

01:02:36.934 --> 01:02:40.654
I'm not at a level
that any human could notice.

01:02:40.734 --> 01:02:43.094
Only dogs could detect my hurt.

01:02:43.214 --> 01:02:44.054
Dogs and me.

01:02:44.174 --> 01:02:46.934
Yes, and you're not a...

01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:48.494
If you were a dog,

01:02:48.614 --> 01:02:50.414
then I should be very happy
for you to...

01:02:50.494 --> 01:02:52.174
gosh, to curl up in my basket

01:02:52.294 --> 01:02:53.774
and chew my bone.

01:02:55.774 --> 01:02:57.854
That sounds...
Yeah, sorry.

01:02:57.934 --> 01:02:59.774
It's all right.

01:03:01.934 --> 01:03:02.814
What's that?

01:03:02.894 --> 01:03:04.094
Sorry, that's...
Can I take this?

01:03:04.174 --> 01:03:06.094
- It's my American agent.
- Sure.

01:03:06.214 --> 01:03:07.054
Hello.

01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:09.414
<i>Steve Coogan.</i>
<i>Hey, man.</i>

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:11.574
- Matt, how are you doing?
- <i>I'm doing good.</i>

01:03:11.694 --> 01:03:13.894
<i>What's the weather like</i>
<i>in Steve Coogan land?</i>

01:03:13.974 --> 01:03:15.654
It's frigging cold.

01:03:15.734 --> 01:03:18.654
<i>Well, it's hot in Hollywood.</i>
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>

01:03:18.734 --> 01:03:21.294
I wish I was.
I know the weather is.

01:03:21.414 --> 01:03:22.774
<i>Cut to the chase.</i>
<i>Cut to the chase.</i>

01:03:22.894 --> 01:03:26.854
<i>You have got co-lead</i>
<i>in a drama series.</i>

01:03:26.934 --> 01:03:29.414
It's called... let me give you
the info here.

01:03:29.534 --> 01:03:31.094
It's called...

01:03:31.214 --> 01:03:33.814
Yeah, it's called <i>Pathological.</i>

01:03:33.934 --> 01:03:35.094
Okay, you play a pathologist.

01:03:35.214 --> 01:03:37.094
<i>If it goes, it's seven years.</i>

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:38.614
<i>If it goes,</i>
<i>you're a household name.</i>

01:03:38.734 --> 01:03:42.894
I think the pork belly
made me a little...

01:03:43.014 --> 01:03:43.854
a little amorous.

01:03:43.974 --> 01:03:46.094
- Did it?
- Yes.

01:03:46.214 --> 01:03:48.134
- Pork will do that to you.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:48.254 --> 01:03:49.334
Was that good news?

01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:50.614
Yeah, kind of.

01:03:50.734 --> 01:03:54.734
It's... they've offered me
a lead in a drama.

01:03:54.854 --> 01:03:56.134
Oh, wow.

01:03:56.214 --> 01:03:58.334
It's nice to, you know,
nice to get an offer like that.

01:03:58.414 --> 01:04:00.854
Absolutely.
That's just fantastic.

01:04:00.974 --> 01:04:03.614
I'm just... my chin's okay,
right?

01:04:03.694 --> 01:04:05.774
- Your chin is absolutely fine.
- Okay.

01:04:05.894 --> 01:04:06.734
It's beautiful.

01:04:06.854 --> 01:04:09.134
I can... you know,
if you ever want to see

01:04:09.214 --> 01:04:14.894
the Bronte sisters' house,
it's not so far.

01:04:15.014 --> 01:04:17.614
If you want to go visit,
I'll take you there.

01:04:41.814 --> 01:04:43.814
Have you noticed
as you get older,

01:04:43.934 --> 01:04:47.454
older women
seem more attractive to you?

01:04:47.534 --> 01:04:50.134
- And younger women.
- And younger women.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:51.094
Women in general.

01:04:51.214 --> 01:04:52.374
Well, yeah.

01:04:52.494 --> 01:04:55.094
Younger women because
of their life-giving qualities,

01:04:55.214 --> 01:04:57.654
and older women just 'cause,
you know,

01:04:57.774 --> 01:05:01.094
'cause you appreciate
personality more.

01:05:01.734 --> 01:05:04.334
I thought we'd try and avoid
the A roads, right,

01:05:04.414 --> 01:05:06.694
and go up the B6255 to Hawes,
right,

01:05:06.774 --> 01:05:08.614
and then cut down through
Oughtershaw,

01:05:08.694 --> 01:05:09.934
Yockenthwaite, Buckden,

01:05:10.014 --> 01:05:12.774
down the B6160
through Kettlewell,

01:05:12.854 --> 01:05:15.454
then the B6265 through
Grassington to Pateley Bridge,

01:05:15.534 --> 01:05:17.214
then up to Ramsgill
from there, right?

01:05:17.294 --> 01:05:18.174
Yes, captain.

01:05:18.254 --> 01:05:19.574
Can we use the sat nav tomorrow?

01:05:19.694 --> 01:05:21.574
The thing about sat nav is,
you don't where you're...

01:05:21.654 --> 01:05:22.894
you have no sense of geography.

01:05:23.014 --> 01:05:25.414
Yeah, but it gets you there
the quickest way.

01:05:25.494 --> 01:05:26.894
It's not about
the destination.

01:05:27.014 --> 01:05:29.454
It's about the journey.

01:05:31.214 --> 01:05:32.974
Ah.

01:05:33.094 --> 01:05:35.694
Well?

01:05:35.774 --> 01:05:36.814
Well?

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:39.134
Did you?

01:05:39.214 --> 01:05:41.534
I meet women. I charm them.
I seduce them.

01:05:41.614 --> 01:05:43.454
It's the aristocratic way.

01:05:43.534 --> 01:05:44.414
Women are my windmills.

01:05:44.494 --> 01:05:45.814
I tilt at them.

01:05:45.934 --> 01:05:49.294
I'm like a knight, a knight
of old, wandering the land...

01:05:49.414 --> 01:05:51.334
Don Quixote.
Yeah?

01:05:51.454 --> 01:05:53.334
In a manner of speaking.

01:05:53.454 --> 01:05:55.934
A British Don Quixote.

01:05:56.014 --> 01:05:57.134
Don Coogan.

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:58.774
The Don.

01:05:58.894 --> 01:06:01.134
Oh, Don Coogan.

01:06:01.254 --> 01:06:03.134
I'm just gonna de-mist
the windows, Rob,

01:06:03.214 --> 01:06:04.294
if that's all right with you.

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:13.254
See that there?

01:06:13.334 --> 01:06:14.214
- That's a brook.
- Yeah.

01:06:14.294 --> 01:06:15.614
You know what it's doing?

01:06:15.694 --> 01:06:17.454
- Babbling.
- Yeah.

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:18.934
The only thing that babbles
is a brook.

01:06:19.054 --> 01:06:20.214
And what else?
What else babbles?

01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:22.574
- You.
- No. No, I ramble.

01:06:22.654 --> 01:06:23.854
I ramble.

01:06:23.974 --> 01:06:25.774
I ramble through the hills
and occasionally

01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:27.894
at dinner parties.

01:06:28.014 --> 01:06:30.734
They used to think this
was a collapsed cave,

01:06:30.814 --> 01:06:33.934
but this was actually formed
about 10,000 years ago

01:06:34.054 --> 01:06:36.014
by just traditional glaciation.

01:06:36.134 --> 01:06:38.414
A big block of ice, say,
a kilometer thick,

01:06:38.534 --> 01:06:41.414
would start to melt,
and normally,

01:06:41.494 --> 01:06:43.814
the water would find
tributaries and sort of...

01:06:43.894 --> 01:06:46.014
Whoa!
Look at that!

01:06:46.094 --> 01:06:49.054
The limestone was too frozen
for the...

01:06:49.134 --> 01:06:50.334
All right. Don't talk.

01:06:50.414 --> 01:06:51.734
For the rivers to find
a way through.

01:06:51.854 --> 01:06:53.054
Stop talking.

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:54.894
Yeah, but I'm just sharing
a bit of information.

01:06:55.014 --> 01:06:56.054
You ought to...

01:06:56.174 --> 01:06:57.814
I don't want to listen
to you all the time.

01:06:57.934 --> 01:06:59.334
I don't want to listen to you
all the time,

01:06:59.454 --> 01:07:00.814
but you give me all that.

01:07:00.894 --> 01:07:02.734
I've been absolutely silent
all the way up here.

01:07:02.854 --> 01:07:04.974
I'm telling you something
useful about what's made this...

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.654
Yeah, and I'd rather
you didn't explain.

01:07:06.734 --> 01:07:08.174
I'd rather look at it
and appreciate it.

01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:10.094
You're just annoyed because
you don't know about...

01:07:10.214 --> 01:07:11.534
It's annoying you
that I know about...

01:07:11.614 --> 01:07:13.694
I'm not annoyed.
I just want to look at it.

01:07:13.774 --> 01:07:15.374
- Just be... shush.
- Okay. All right.

01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:17.134
I never thought you'd tell me
to shush.

01:07:17.214 --> 01:07:18.174
Christ.

01:07:20.814 --> 01:07:22.214
Wow.

01:07:26.974 --> 01:07:28.694
Five years have passed.

01:07:28.814 --> 01:07:32.614
Five summers with the length
of five long winters,

01:07:32.734 --> 01:07:35.854
and again I hear these waters

01:07:35.974 --> 01:07:41.334
rolling from their mountain
springs with soft inland murmur.

01:07:41.454 --> 01:07:46.214
Oft in lonely rooms
'mid the din of towns and cities

01:07:46.294 --> 01:07:51.694
I have owed to them in times
of weariness sensations sweet.

01:07:51.814 --> 01:07:54.334
You know where
that was written?

01:07:54.414 --> 01:07:57.574
Tintern Abbey, Wales.

01:07:57.654 --> 01:07:59.974
I know.
That's why I asked you.

01:08:00.054 --> 01:08:02.094
Oft in lonely rooms

01:08:02.214 --> 01:08:04.854
'mid the din of towns and cities

01:08:04.974 --> 01:08:07.334
I have owed to them in hours
of weariness...

01:08:07.454 --> 01:08:09.134
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling it.

01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:11.454
Why do you have to do it
in that voice?

01:08:11.534 --> 01:08:13.934
Come on.
Let's head on up.

01:08:14.014 --> 01:08:14.894
Where?

01:08:14.974 --> 01:08:16.654
Up there.

01:08:16.734 --> 01:08:18.694
- You serious?
- Yeah.

01:08:18.774 --> 01:08:20.014
- No.
- Why?

01:08:20.094 --> 01:08:22.214
It's too dangerous.

01:08:22.294 --> 01:08:25.613
You've just got to make sure
you've got secure footing.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.613
They've got hats
and backpacks.

01:08:27.694 --> 01:08:29.814
The backpack makes it harder.

01:08:29.934 --> 01:08:32.174
I sometimes get, like,
a fluttery heart,

01:08:32.294 --> 01:08:34.094
like, an arrhythmic heartbeat,
and I've got it now.

01:08:34.214 --> 01:08:35.214
I get it when I'm stressed.

01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:37.814
All right.
Well, I'm going that way.

01:08:37.934 --> 01:08:39.814
I'll be about a couple of hours,
right?

01:08:39.894 --> 01:08:40.774
How long?

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:42.734
- Two hours.
- Two hours?

01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:46.694
Yeah, if it gets to three,
then mountain rescue.

01:08:46.814 --> 01:08:49.254
If you break your leg,
don't come running to me.

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.453
Ha-ha. Very good.

01:08:51.533 --> 01:08:53.493
Steve.

01:08:53.613 --> 01:08:56.453
Steve!

01:08:56.573 --> 01:08:57.974
Be careful.

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:04.374
- Afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:10:04.494 --> 01:10:05.574
Lovely day.

01:10:05.654 --> 01:10:06.534
Beautiful, yeah.

01:10:06.614 --> 01:10:07.494
Absolutely superb.

01:10:07.574 --> 01:10:08.814
I know.
It's magical.

01:10:08.894 --> 01:10:11.294
Yeah,
we're very fortunate today.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:13.574
Have you been here, around
this area for a while, or...

01:10:13.654 --> 01:10:16.014
Yeah, I'm aware of, you know...

01:10:16.134 --> 01:10:17.534
Oh, that's excellent.

01:10:17.614 --> 01:10:19.174
You know about
the limestone a wee bit

01:10:19.294 --> 01:10:21.014
without being clever.

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:23.174
So you'll know that it started
off life in the Bahamas

01:10:23.294 --> 01:10:25.734
somewhere around
that sort of line of latitude

01:10:25.814 --> 01:10:27.414
south of the equator.

01:10:27.534 --> 01:10:29.134
Well, the land mass
was part of Avalonia.

01:10:29.254 --> 01:10:30.814
That's right, yeah.
Yeah.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:33.534
Which had joined onto Laurasia,
of course,

01:10:33.614 --> 01:10:36.654
and world famous
Malham limestone pavement,

01:10:36.774 --> 01:10:37.934
I suppose,
you would describe it.

01:10:38.054 --> 01:10:40.734
Malham Cove,
it's in many, many textbooks.

01:10:40.814 --> 01:10:41.894
No, well aware of it.

01:10:42.014 --> 01:10:43.214
And photographs.
Tremendous.

01:10:43.294 --> 01:10:44.694
The only disadvantage
with limestone,

01:10:44.814 --> 01:10:45.734
although a very hard rock,

01:10:45.814 --> 01:10:48.134
road wearing
and all the rest of it,

01:10:48.214 --> 01:10:50.974
coarse base stuff,
it dissolves in weak acid,

01:10:51.054 --> 01:10:54.054
and the acid derives
from the water,

01:10:54.134 --> 01:10:56.854
rainwater which combines
with carbon dioxide

01:10:56.974 --> 01:10:59.934
in the atmosphere,
and then the rain falls

01:11:00.014 --> 01:11:02.734
onto the limestone,
which is calcium carbonate.

01:11:02.854 --> 01:11:03.894
Yeah.

01:11:04.014 --> 01:11:05.414
And the features
that we're looking at,

01:11:05.534 --> 01:11:08.654
these linear features,
begun as, basically,

01:11:08.734 --> 01:11:09.974
cracks in the rock
as it lithified.

01:11:10.094 --> 01:11:11.174
That's right. Yeah.

01:11:11.254 --> 01:11:13.694
And of course,
they've dissolved into the width

01:11:13.774 --> 01:11:15.454
that we see today,
as have the...

01:11:15.534 --> 01:11:20.894
not only the longitudinal ones,
the east-west ones, same thing,

01:11:20.974 --> 01:11:24.734
but the features on the surface
are, indeed, very famous indeed.

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:26.854
You'll see a number
of these little potholes.

01:11:26.934 --> 01:11:28.094
Oh, yeah.

01:11:28.174 --> 01:11:32.974
They are water solution holes
known as rundkarren.

01:11:33.094 --> 01:11:34.254
Yeah.

01:11:34.334 --> 01:11:38.214
The long features on
the surface are the rillenkaren.

01:11:38.334 --> 01:11:40.574
Fantastic.
It's fascinating stuff.

01:11:40.654 --> 01:11:41.614
Yeah.

01:11:41.694 --> 01:11:42.894
Okay, I'll be on my way.

01:11:42.974 --> 01:11:45.134
- Righto.
- Thanks. Cheerio.

01:11:45.254 --> 01:11:46.214
Bye.

01:11:54.734 --> 01:11:59.414
Here we are.
The Yorke Arms.

01:11:59.534 --> 01:12:00.374
Wonderful.

01:12:00.494 --> 01:12:01.414
Wow.

01:12:04.614 --> 01:12:05.454
This is your room, sir.

01:12:05.574 --> 01:12:07.374
Oh, beautiful. Yeah.

01:12:07.494 --> 01:12:08.374
Oh, it's lovely.

01:12:08.494 --> 01:12:09.934
The bathroom
is just over there.

01:12:10.054 --> 01:12:10.894
Yeah.

01:12:11.014 --> 01:12:13.134
Oak. Nice oak.

01:12:13.214 --> 01:12:15.734
If you need anything,
we'll be in reception.

01:12:15.854 --> 01:12:17.854
Okay, can you get
phone reception around here?

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.494
No, I'm sorry,
but if you go along the lake,

01:12:20.614 --> 01:12:22.534
you can have some reception
there.

01:12:22.654 --> 01:12:24.094
- Great. Lovely. Okay.
- Okay.

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:27.454
<i>Hello?</i>

01:12:27.534 --> 01:12:28.414
Hey. Hey.

01:12:28.494 --> 01:12:30.094
<i>Where have you been?</i>

01:12:30.214 --> 01:12:31.494
<i>I called you four times</i>
<i>last night.</i>

01:12:31.574 --> 01:12:32.574
<i>You didn't call me back.</i>

01:12:32.654 --> 01:12:33.534
I know, honey.

01:12:33.614 --> 01:12:34.494
Listen... look...

01:12:36.014 --> 01:12:39.894
These restaurants that
you've picked are great places,

01:12:40.014 --> 01:12:41.094
but the phone reception sucks.

01:12:41.174 --> 01:12:42.054
It's really bad.

01:12:42.134 --> 01:12:43.654
Have you been doing drugs?

01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:45.694
No.

01:12:45.774 --> 01:12:46.854
No, of course not.

01:12:46.974 --> 01:12:48.934
Look, if you couldn't get me,
I was...

01:12:49.014 --> 01:12:51.254
You know where I am right now?
I'm in a field.

01:12:51.374 --> 01:12:53.454
It's a very beautiful field.

01:12:53.574 --> 01:12:55.254
It's really gorgeous,

01:12:55.374 --> 01:12:57.174
but, you know,
I can't really enjoy it.

01:12:57.294 --> 01:13:00.774
I'm with a short Welsh man
who does impressions.

01:13:00.854 --> 01:13:02.174
It's not fun.

01:13:02.254 --> 01:13:05.854
So are there lots of pretty
Northern waitresses up there?

01:13:05.934 --> 01:13:09.294
No, there's no beautiful
Northern waitresses.

01:13:09.414 --> 01:13:14.214
They're all Spanish or Polish
or from somewhere.

01:13:14.294 --> 01:13:16.014
<i>Great, so they're beautiful</i>

01:13:16.094 --> 01:13:17.614
<i>Eastern European</i>
<i>waitresses up there.</i>

01:13:17.734 --> 01:13:18.894
<i>Perfect.</i>

01:13:19.014 --> 01:13:20.974
Yeah, well, yeah, listen,
you're the one who said

01:13:21.094 --> 01:13:23.774
we were taking a break, so,
you know, what do you expect?

01:13:23.854 --> 01:13:25.454
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>you've been with other girls</i>

01:13:25.574 --> 01:13:28.174
<i>because we're on a break?</i>

01:13:28.294 --> 01:13:29.254
I wish you were here.

01:13:29.374 --> 01:13:30.774
You could have been here
with me.

01:13:30.894 --> 01:13:31.814
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

01:13:31.894 --> 01:13:33.134
You chose not to be.

01:13:33.254 --> 01:13:36.894
Well, you know where I am.
You can come see me anytime.

01:13:36.974 --> 01:13:40.374
Oh, Christ.

01:13:40.494 --> 01:13:42.654
<i>Look at the time.</i>
<i>Got to go, Steve.</i>

01:13:42.734 --> 01:13:44.574
<i>Hope you get reception again</i>
<i>sometime soon.</i>

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:46.654
All right. Yes. Thanks.
Bye, baby. Bye, bye.

01:13:46.734 --> 01:13:49.094
Okay, bye, bye, bye.

01:14:01.894 --> 01:14:03.414
What is that, a sonar?

01:14:10.694 --> 01:14:11.534
It's got to be...

01:14:23.214 --> 01:14:26.134
No, you sound like a submarine
clearing its throat.

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:28.494
Sound like a Scouse submarine.

01:14:30.294 --> 01:14:31.934
Gentlemen, have you decided
what you'd like?

01:14:32.014 --> 01:14:36.054
Could I have the soufflé to
start and then the lamb, please?

01:14:36.174 --> 01:14:37.414
And the lamb to follow.
Thank you.

01:14:37.494 --> 01:14:39.334
Tuna followed by the cod,
please.

01:14:39.414 --> 01:14:42.094
And then the cod.
Lovely. Thank you very much.

01:14:42.214 --> 01:14:43.094
I'll take those for you.

01:14:43.214 --> 01:14:44.374
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:14:44.494 --> 01:14:45.334
Just take that for you.

01:14:45.454 --> 01:14:46.734
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:14:46.854 --> 01:14:50.574
Do you know the Abba song
<i>The Winner Takes It All?</i>

01:14:52.294 --> 01:14:54.214
The reason that song
has so much pain

01:14:54.294 --> 01:14:57.934
is because he wrote the words
for her to sing

01:14:58.014 --> 01:15:00.214
about their breakup,

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:02.574
but he wrote the lyrics
from her point of view.

01:15:02.694 --> 01:15:06.054
# I apologize #

01:15:06.174 --> 01:15:09.974
# If it makes you feel sad #

01:15:10.094 --> 01:15:12.534
# Seeing me so tense #

01:15:12.654 --> 01:15:15.574
both: # No self-confidence #

01:15:15.694 --> 01:15:17.094
But you see...

01:15:17.214 --> 01:15:19.814
both: # The winner
takes it all #

01:15:19.894 --> 01:15:22.934
It's a bit presumptuous
that he's saying

01:15:23.054 --> 01:15:24.174
that she has no self-confidence.

01:15:24.294 --> 01:15:25.134
She might say...

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:26.494
But wait,

01:15:26.574 --> 01:15:27.854
I have plenty
of self-confidence.

01:15:27.934 --> 01:15:29.134
I'm just sad
about the breakdown.

01:15:29.254 --> 01:15:31.294
One tuna away, please.

01:15:34.934 --> 01:15:37.254
# I don't want to talk #

01:15:37.334 --> 01:15:40.014
both: # About things
we've gone through #

01:15:40.094 --> 01:15:41.614
# Though it's hurting me #

01:15:41.734 --> 01:15:42.934
All of her Ss are high.

01:15:43.054 --> 01:15:45.174
Though it'ssss herding me...

01:15:45.294 --> 01:15:46.134
"Herding"?

01:15:46.254 --> 01:15:48.454
Now it'ssss hissstory.

01:15:48.534 --> 01:15:51.014
Don't make her like the chef
from the Muppets.

01:15:51.134 --> 01:15:52.734
# Though it's herding me #

01:15:54.534 --> 01:15:55.654
He was Swedish.

01:15:55.734 --> 01:15:56.974
He wasn't in Abba.

01:15:57.054 --> 01:16:00.134
# Now it's hissstory #

01:16:00.214 --> 01:16:01.934
# I played all my cards #

01:16:02.054 --> 01:16:04.614
Now you sound like the Nazis
from <i>Inglourious Basterds.</i>

01:16:04.694 --> 01:16:06.494
- Who I look like.
- Yes.

01:16:06.574 --> 01:16:08.334
# I played all my cards #

01:16:08.414 --> 01:16:10.054
Now it's hurting me,

01:16:10.134 --> 01:16:12.374
and now I'm going to kill
some Jews under the floor.

01:16:14.254 --> 01:16:16.134
<i>Und</i> that's what
you've done too.

01:16:16.214 --> 01:16:17.734
That's what you've done too.

01:16:17.814 --> 01:16:20.334
The winner takes it all,
Mr. Bond.

01:16:20.454 --> 01:16:22.734
Come, come, Mr. Bond.
The winner takes it all.

01:16:23.814 --> 01:16:25.174
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

01:16:25.294 --> 01:16:28.334
you enjoy playing all your cards
just as much as I do.

01:16:28.454 --> 01:16:29.614
When I play my cards,

01:16:29.734 --> 01:16:31.374
I play for Benny and Bjorn.

01:16:34.014 --> 01:16:37.174
I find the song quite moving.

01:16:46.014 --> 01:16:49.534
Your roast cod
with truffle ravioli

01:16:49.614 --> 01:16:51.174
and a spiced cauliflower.

01:16:51.254 --> 01:16:53.694
A saddle of Nidderdale lamb
with mutton pudding.

01:16:53.774 --> 01:16:55.334
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

01:16:55.414 --> 01:16:56.454
Thank you.

01:16:56.574 --> 01:16:57.454
Yeah.

01:16:57.534 --> 01:17:01.574
Hopkins, Sheen,
Brydon, Burton,

01:17:01.654 --> 01:17:04.174
the Port Talbot four.

01:17:04.294 --> 01:17:05.614
- That's what we're known as.
- Really?

01:17:05.694 --> 01:17:08.134
Yeah, Michael Sheen.

01:17:08.214 --> 01:17:09.534
How are you?

01:17:09.614 --> 01:17:12.414
Good evening.

01:17:14.094 --> 01:17:16.854
We couldn't have done that
the way that Michael does it.

01:17:16.974 --> 01:17:17.934
Let's face it.

01:17:18.054 --> 01:17:19.414
- We could not have played...
- We? We? We?

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.174
We couldn't. We couldn't.
We're not the same.

01:17:21.294 --> 01:17:22.134
We're different animals.

01:17:22.254 --> 01:17:23.334
We couldn't play those parts.

01:17:23.414 --> 01:17:24.814
No, you're not
the same as him.

01:17:24.894 --> 01:17:26.254
I'm more similar to him.

01:17:26.334 --> 01:17:28.574
Well, why don't you do
the sort of roles that he does?

01:17:28.654 --> 01:17:31.854
Because no one
will give those roles to me.

01:17:31.974 --> 01:17:33.294
I've got an albatross
around my neck,

01:17:33.374 --> 01:17:35.974
and it's got the face
of Michael Sheen.

01:17:36.054 --> 01:17:38.614
Do you try for those roles?

01:17:38.734 --> 01:17:40.294
Yeah, and Michael Sheen
gets them all.

01:17:40.414 --> 01:17:41.734
Michael Sheen is very good.

01:17:41.814 --> 01:17:44.694
- Michael Sheen is always...
- Brilliant.

01:17:44.814 --> 01:17:46.334
He's not brilliant; he's good.
He's solid.

01:17:46.414 --> 01:17:47.294
He is brilliant.

01:17:47.374 --> 01:17:50.134
I'm fucking brilliant!

01:17:50.254 --> 01:17:52.454
Yes, but not
in the same way as...

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:54.774
Michael Sheen couldn't do
what you do.

01:17:54.894 --> 01:17:56.894
Michael Sheen couldn't play
Alan Partridge.

01:17:56.974 --> 01:17:58.494
Michael Sheen couldn't play
Pauline Calf.

01:17:58.574 --> 01:17:59.694
All right?

01:17:59.814 --> 01:18:01.614
But equally,
you couldn't play David Frost.

01:18:01.734 --> 01:18:02.734
Huh?

01:18:02.854 --> 01:18:05.254
I don't believe
that you really believe

01:18:05.374 --> 01:18:06.614
that I couldn't play
David Frost.

01:18:06.734 --> 01:18:08.654
I think you could play it.
Of course you could play it.

01:18:08.774 --> 01:18:10.454
Bloody hell.
The waiter could play it.

01:18:10.574 --> 01:18:12.214
But how well
are you gonna play it?

01:18:12.334 --> 01:18:14.094
Very well.

01:18:14.174 --> 01:18:15.454
Hello.

01:18:18.734 --> 01:18:20.654
I mean, Michael almost
doesn't have to say the words.

01:18:20.734 --> 01:18:21.694
He can just go...

01:18:24.654 --> 01:18:26.174
And you know what he's doing.

01:18:28.494 --> 01:18:30.254
You were just
jutting your chin out.

01:18:30.334 --> 01:18:31.614
Mm, that's me.

01:18:31.694 --> 01:18:33.334
If Michael did it,
people would go,

01:18:33.454 --> 01:18:35.334
"Fucking hell,
it's David Frost."

01:18:35.454 --> 01:18:39.054
Well, you know, I got down to
the last two for Peter Sellers.

01:18:39.134 --> 01:18:40.734
Yes, you did,
and on that count,

01:18:40.814 --> 01:18:42.614
as I've told you
many times before,

01:18:42.734 --> 01:18:44.494
you would have been better
than Geoffrey Rush.

01:18:44.574 --> 01:18:46.254
You know,
I was actually in that film?

01:18:46.334 --> 01:18:47.374
Have I told you this?

01:18:47.494 --> 01:18:49.094
I played Dustin Hoffman.

01:18:49.174 --> 01:18:50.614
Oh, yes,
when he got his Oscar.

01:18:50.734 --> 01:18:53.254
I had to do
a speech as Dustin Hoffman.

01:18:53.334 --> 01:18:54.254
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:54.334 --> 01:18:56.534
He says... and I learned this,
right?

01:18:56.654 --> 01:19:00.574
I refuse to accept that
I'm better than Jack Lemmon,

01:19:00.654 --> 01:19:01.654
than Peter Sellers,

01:19:01.774 --> 01:19:03.294
than whoever else
the other one was.

01:19:03.374 --> 01:19:04.814
He could have turned down
the award.

01:19:04.894 --> 01:19:07.854
He could have turned down the
Oscar if he refused to accept...

01:19:07.974 --> 01:19:09.374
Yeah, all right.
That's not the point.

01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:11.494
I'm just saying that I was
in it, and I got cut out.

01:19:16.734 --> 01:19:19.134
Oh, wow. Thank you very much.
Look at that.

01:19:19.214 --> 01:19:21.134
It's a chocolate
inverted comma.

01:19:21.214 --> 01:19:22.694
He's got an ironic dessert.

01:19:22.814 --> 01:19:24.254
Thank you.

01:19:24.334 --> 01:19:25.654
Your apple Breton
with lemon sorbet

01:19:25.774 --> 01:19:27.054
and croque monsieur.

01:19:27.134 --> 01:19:29.574
And your chocolate dessert
is a warm chocolate fondant,

01:19:29.654 --> 01:19:31.494
chocolate tier,
chocolate Neapolitan,

01:19:31.574 --> 01:19:32.774
and a chocolate
and caramel tart.

01:19:32.854 --> 01:19:33.814
Thank you very much indeed.

01:19:33.934 --> 01:19:35.454
Can there be
any more chocolate?

01:19:35.534 --> 01:19:36.494
You want some of that?

01:19:36.574 --> 01:19:38.894
Okay, yeah.

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:39.974
Good, isn't it?

01:19:40.054 --> 01:19:41.574
I'm sure people think
we're gay.

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:42.734
I don't care.

01:19:42.854 --> 01:19:46.694
No, I don't either.
I don't care.

01:19:46.814 --> 01:19:48.814
Where are you?
I don't know where you are.

01:19:48.934 --> 01:19:50.214
Somebody get me out of here.

01:19:50.294 --> 01:19:52.374
Who'd have
thought that would catch on, eh?

01:19:52.494 --> 01:19:53.774
Got an iPhone app
with that on it now.

01:19:53.854 --> 01:19:54.934
Really?

01:19:55.054 --> 01:19:56.534
Haven't launched it.
About to launch it.

01:19:56.654 --> 01:19:58.054
What, to launch an iPhone app
with your...

01:19:58.174 --> 01:20:00.494
Rob Brydon,
Small Man in a Box.

01:20:00.614 --> 01:20:01.574
I'm not a good businessman.

01:20:01.654 --> 01:20:02.894
I'm an artist.

01:20:02.974 --> 01:20:05.774
I'm cursed to be flawed
in my business ventures, but...

01:20:05.894 --> 01:20:07.214
I got to tell you,

01:20:07.294 --> 01:20:08.854
the food here is terrible,

01:20:08.974 --> 01:20:10.974
and such small portions.

01:20:13.014 --> 01:20:15.934
Sex without love
is an empty experience,

01:20:16.014 --> 01:20:19.334
but as empty experiences go,
it's one of the best.

01:20:19.454 --> 01:20:22.854
You know, sex between two
people is a wonderful thing.

01:20:22.934 --> 01:20:24.374
Between three, it's terrific.

01:20:25.614 --> 01:20:28.334
No, really, I enjoyed
making love last night.

01:20:28.414 --> 01:20:31.814
It was the most fun
I've had without laughing.

01:20:31.934 --> 01:20:34.334
You know, they tell me...
I hear my ex-wife

01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:36.614
was violated in the street.

01:20:36.694 --> 01:20:37.814
I said, " Knowing my ex-wife,

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:40.294
it was probably
not a moving violation."

01:20:44.294 --> 01:20:45.134
<i>Hello?</i>

01:20:45.254 --> 01:20:46.254
Hey, Joe.
It's Dad.

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:47.294
Yeah, I know.

01:20:47.374 --> 01:20:48.854
Your name comes up
on the screen.

01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:49.814
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

01:20:49.934 --> 01:20:51.454
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

01:20:51.534 --> 01:20:53.094
I spoke to your mum.

01:20:53.214 --> 01:20:55.054
She told me what happened
the other night.

01:20:55.174 --> 01:20:57.494
<i>I was just with some friends.</i>
<i>You know, it was only a drink.</i>

01:20:57.614 --> 01:20:58.494
<i>Just having a bit of fun.</i>

01:20:58.574 --> 01:21:01.214
You can't do that.

01:21:01.294 --> 01:21:04.614
If you work hard and...
you know...

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:08.254
then you can always...

01:21:08.334 --> 01:21:09.774
you know, enjoy yourself
at the weekend.

01:21:09.894 --> 01:21:12.414
But you've got to rein it in
during the week.

01:21:12.494 --> 01:21:14.454
You have to, all right?

01:21:14.574 --> 01:21:17.014
Okay.
How's the trip?

01:21:17.134 --> 01:21:18.934
Uh...

01:21:19.054 --> 01:21:21.374
It's good.

01:21:21.454 --> 01:21:25.534
You know,
it's kind of enjoyable.

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:28.494
Rob's being, you know,
sort of a pain in the ass,

01:21:28.574 --> 01:21:31.094
but I tolerate him.

01:21:31.214 --> 01:21:32.414
How long have you known him?

01:21:32.494 --> 01:21:34.214
Rob?

01:21:34.294 --> 01:21:37.334
11 years.
Something like that.

01:21:37.454 --> 01:21:39.734
That's amazing.

01:21:39.854 --> 01:21:40.774
<i>Is it?</i>

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:42.254
Yeah.
That's such a long time.

01:21:42.334 --> 01:21:45.174
Yes.

01:21:45.294 --> 01:21:47.174
Yeah, I suppose it is.

01:21:47.294 --> 01:21:48.174
Yeah, he's...

01:21:51.494 --> 01:21:53.614
Yeah, he's a, you know,
he's a good friend.

01:21:53.734 --> 01:21:54.894
<i>Yeah, I miss you.</i>

01:21:55.014 --> 01:21:57.654
Yeah, I miss you too.

01:21:57.774 --> 01:22:00.734
Okay, listen, I'll be back soon,

01:22:00.814 --> 01:22:03.894
and we'll have some
fun time together, yeah?

01:22:04.014 --> 01:22:05.894
Constructive fun time,
all right?

01:22:05.974 --> 01:22:07.654
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:22:07.734 --> 01:22:09.934
All right, listen, love you.

01:22:10.014 --> 01:22:12.574
Take care, and behave.

01:22:12.654 --> 01:22:13.894
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:22:13.974 --> 01:22:14.894
- All right, mate.
- <i>See ya.</i>

01:22:15.014 --> 01:22:15.974
See ya.

01:22:28.574 --> 01:22:31.854
I am once again bottomless.

01:22:31.934 --> 01:22:33.454
<i>Don't you ever get cold</i>
<i>being bottomless?</i>

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:34.414
No, no, I don't.

01:22:34.534 --> 01:22:37.094
I think of you,
and I just let him free.

01:22:37.174 --> 01:22:39.294
I let him off the lead,
as it were.

01:22:39.374 --> 01:22:40.574
Let him run round the car park

01:22:40.654 --> 01:22:42.974
in the hope that he sniffs up
something interesting.

01:22:43.054 --> 01:22:44.334
He's under there now.

01:22:44.414 --> 01:22:46.534
There's only a kind of
candlewick bedspread between...

01:22:46.614 --> 01:22:49.574
<i>Oh, candlewick bedspread?</i>
<i>That's not very sexy.</i>

01:22:49.654 --> 01:22:51.814
Well, there's a phone
resting on him as well,

01:22:51.894 --> 01:22:53.774
so if the phone begins to move,

01:22:53.854 --> 01:22:57.614
I'll know that you're weaving
your magic, as it were.

01:22:57.734 --> 01:22:59.414
Oh, help me.

01:22:59.534 --> 01:23:02.854
I'm the small man
stuck in a box.

01:23:02.934 --> 01:23:05.494
Oh.

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:07.214
I'm trapped in a box.

01:23:09.854 --> 01:23:14.814
I'm trapped in a...
I'm trapped in a box.

01:23:14.894 --> 01:23:18.414
I'm trapped in a box.

01:23:24.214 --> 01:23:25.734
I'm stuck in a box.
What are you doing?

01:23:25.854 --> 01:23:28.814
What's happening?
What's happening?

01:23:28.934 --> 01:23:30.694
Small man stuck in a box.

01:23:33.454 --> 01:23:38.134
I don't care
about silly voices.

01:23:38.254 --> 01:23:39.774
They're stupid.

01:23:46.734 --> 01:23:48.614
Why are we going so early?

01:23:48.734 --> 01:23:52.494
Because I want to take in
Bolton Abbey

01:23:52.614 --> 01:23:54.774
and then quickly say hi
to my parents.

01:23:54.894 --> 01:23:56.934
You don't mind...
do you mind coming to say...

01:23:57.054 --> 01:23:58.134
- Physically?
- Yes.

01:23:58.254 --> 01:23:59.254
Actually visit them?

01:23:59.374 --> 01:24:01.134
Well, I can't leave you
in the car.

01:24:01.254 --> 01:24:04.974
You could bring me a lemonade
and a packet of crisps,

01:24:05.094 --> 01:24:07.774
leave the window like that
so I don't get too hot.

01:24:07.854 --> 01:24:09.894
Yeah, and I'll bring
my parents out to look at you,

01:24:09.974 --> 01:24:12.134
and your nose is through the gap
there like that.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.054
You can say,
"I would bring him in,

01:24:14.134 --> 01:24:15.134
but he might make a mess."

01:24:19.934 --> 01:24:23.214
From Bolton's
old monastic tower,

01:24:23.294 --> 01:24:26.414
the bells ring loud
with gladsome power.

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.214
The sun shines bright.

01:24:28.334 --> 01:24:29.614
The fields are gay

01:24:29.694 --> 01:24:32.494
with people in their best array

01:24:32.574 --> 01:24:35.694
of stole and doublet,
hood and scarf,

01:24:35.814 --> 01:24:38.534
along the banks
of crystal Wharf.

01:24:38.614 --> 01:24:46.094
And thus in joyous mood they hie
to Bolton's mouldering Priory.

01:24:46.174 --> 01:24:48.494
Sir Ian McKellan.

01:24:48.614 --> 01:24:50.894
Come, we shall walk together.

01:24:50.974 --> 01:24:52.654
Is that why you went
to bed early last night,

01:24:52.734 --> 01:24:53.894
so you could learn that poem?

01:24:53.974 --> 01:24:56.454
Yes.
Mission accomplished.

01:24:56.574 --> 01:24:57.574
I don't know why...

01:24:57.654 --> 01:24:59.054
You weren't interested
in Wordsworth

01:24:59.134 --> 01:25:00.134
before we went on this trip.

01:25:00.214 --> 01:25:01.854
Or Bolton Abbey,
going on about Bolton Abbey.

01:25:01.934 --> 01:25:03.214
This is lovely.
This is fantastic.

01:25:03.334 --> 01:25:04.454
I know it is.

01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:06.214
Why'd you have to do it
in Ian McKellan's voice?

01:25:06.294 --> 01:25:07.534
It was a lovely poem.

01:25:07.654 --> 01:25:09.854
What would have been really nice
is if you got up this morning...

01:25:09.934 --> 01:25:11.694
If you learned that poem,
which I appreciate,

01:25:11.814 --> 01:25:13.534
even though it was meant
to intimidate me.

01:25:13.614 --> 01:25:15.174
If you got up this morning
and said the poem

01:25:15.294 --> 01:25:16.894
in your own voice
and meant the words.

01:25:16.974 --> 01:25:19.934
I chose a voice
to suit the mood.

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:22.254
I felt Sir Ian,
coming, as he does, from Bolton,

01:25:22.374 --> 01:25:23.854
would be perfectly suited...

01:25:23.974 --> 01:25:25.494
It's a different Bolton, Rob.

01:25:25.614 --> 01:25:27.014
Yeah, well, same word.

01:25:27.094 --> 01:25:29.934
I thought he'd be perfectly
suited for here.

01:25:30.014 --> 01:25:30.894
And it is incredible.

01:25:31.014 --> 01:25:33.094
I mean, look,
that is incredible.

01:25:34.814 --> 01:25:37.694
Standing on a grave.
Sorry.

01:25:37.774 --> 01:25:40.454
Will you be buried,
or will you be cremated?

01:25:40.534 --> 01:25:43.294
I think I would like
to be buried,

01:25:43.374 --> 01:25:45.494
so that I have a headstone,
like Elvis,

01:25:45.614 --> 01:25:49.014
but I think
that when you have a headstone

01:25:49.134 --> 01:25:52.814
and you're in a place, it puts
great pressure on your family,

01:25:52.894 --> 01:25:55.014
your surviving family,
to visit you.

01:25:55.094 --> 01:25:58.014
I'd be happy if you,
you know...

01:25:58.094 --> 01:25:59.254
I'm happy with either.

01:25:59.374 --> 01:26:01.454
If they buried you
or cremated you,

01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:05.974
they would both suit me fine.

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:08.294
Would you come to my funeral?
Would you turn up, do you think?

01:26:08.374 --> 01:26:10.014
Course I would.
Course I would. Yeah.

01:26:10.094 --> 01:26:12.614
If only to pad out the numbers,
you know.

01:26:12.694 --> 01:26:17.454
You know when someone dies
and they go to the funeral

01:26:17.574 --> 01:26:19.294
and they say, you know,

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:20.934
"We should have done this
when he was alive.

01:26:21.054 --> 01:26:22.174
He would have loved this."

01:26:22.254 --> 01:26:24.854
What, cremated him?

01:26:24.974 --> 01:26:28.454
No, you know,
hearing the eulogies.

01:26:28.534 --> 01:26:29.934
That's what I'll say
at your funeral.

01:26:30.014 --> 01:26:31.854
We should have done this
a lot when he was alive,

01:26:31.974 --> 01:26:32.814
cremated him.

01:26:34.254 --> 01:26:37.294
No riposte from you,
'cause you're dead.

01:26:37.414 --> 01:26:39.134
I don't think
you should say that.

01:26:39.214 --> 01:26:40.094
You really shouldn't...

01:26:40.174 --> 01:26:41.574
- Yeah.
- In the box.

01:26:41.654 --> 01:26:43.854
You wouldn't be able to come
back with your man in a box

01:26:43.974 --> 01:26:46.214
even though it would be
fantastic if you had,

01:26:46.294 --> 01:26:47.334
'cause you'd be in a coffin.

01:26:47.414 --> 01:26:49.014
It would have been the perfect
place to do it,

01:26:49.134 --> 01:26:50.294
but you wouldn't be able
to do it...

01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:51.694
I would literally be a man
in the box.

01:26:51.814 --> 01:26:53.014
I know, it would
have been great,

01:26:53.134 --> 01:26:55.854
but I'd be safe in the knowledge
that I could do that,

01:26:55.934 --> 01:26:57.414
and he won't come back
with his man in a box,

01:26:57.534 --> 01:26:58.694
which would have been brilliant,

01:26:58.774 --> 01:27:01.654
but he can't,
'cause he's brown bread.

01:27:01.774 --> 01:27:04.374
I'd be there. I'd be there.
I'd be at your funeral.

01:27:04.494 --> 01:27:09.414
And now, from one of Rob's
very closest friends...

01:27:09.534 --> 01:27:12.974
you'll know him, of course,
as TV's Alan Partridge,

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:17.574
and he has asked specifically to
come up and take 25, 30 minutes

01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:21.214
to talk about his friend Rob.

01:27:21.294 --> 01:27:23.294
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:27:23.374 --> 01:27:25.334
Steve Coogan.

01:27:25.454 --> 01:27:27.934
Oh, you may
also know Steve

01:27:28.014 --> 01:27:30.254
from some of his very good
art house films

01:27:30.334 --> 01:27:31.574
that have been
very well reviewed

01:27:31.694 --> 01:27:33.054
by some of
the broadsheet newspapers.

01:27:33.134 --> 01:27:35.334
Steve Coogan.

01:27:36.374 --> 01:27:38.294
Thanks. Thank you.

01:27:38.414 --> 01:27:39.654
A-ha!

01:27:39.734 --> 01:27:42.334
Somebody will shout that out.
One of my Welsh relatives.

01:27:42.414 --> 01:27:44.134
Yes, yes.

01:27:44.214 --> 01:27:45.734
Alan Partridge.

01:27:45.854 --> 01:27:47.894
Very much alive

01:27:48.014 --> 01:27:53.894
compared with our good departed
friend Rob Brydon.

01:27:54.014 --> 01:27:57.454
Rob was an interesting guy,

01:27:57.574 --> 01:27:58.654
very funny,

01:27:58.734 --> 01:28:02.534
very entertaining,
and yet, at the same time,

01:28:02.654 --> 01:28:04.374
there was something...

01:28:04.494 --> 01:28:07.854
Although he made me laugh
and made us all laugh, I think,

01:28:07.974 --> 01:28:11.054
there was something about him
that was lost,

01:28:11.134 --> 01:28:15.854
something about him that seemed
unable to confront

01:28:15.974 --> 01:28:20.014
the reality of life,
and so when I think of Rob,

01:28:20.134 --> 01:28:23.494
I think of him with both a smile

01:28:23.614 --> 01:28:26.374
at some of the funny,
pithy one-liners

01:28:26.454 --> 01:28:28.694
he would come out with
on Radio 4 panel shows,

01:28:28.814 --> 01:28:33.494
but also for the man inside,

01:28:33.614 --> 01:28:39.454
because behind every little,
pithy, vaguely amusing joke

01:28:39.534 --> 01:28:41.894
is a cry for help.

01:28:44.014 --> 01:28:45.214
Not gonna finish there,
are you?

01:28:45.294 --> 01:28:47.974
- I won't finish there, no.
- Jesus Christ.

01:28:48.054 --> 01:28:49.454
Um...

01:28:52.014 --> 01:28:56.894
But of course, let's not
remember a man who was lost,

01:28:56.974 --> 01:28:59.694
desperately trying
to legitimize his life

01:28:59.774 --> 01:29:02.934
by doing silly voices constantly
and not confronting the truth.

01:29:03.054 --> 01:29:05.294
Let's remember
the other side of Rob,

01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:07.974
the Rob Brydon the entertainer,

01:29:08.054 --> 01:29:13.294
the Rob Brydon who gave
some levity to our life

01:29:13.374 --> 01:29:17.294
and helped us avoid confronting
the harsh realities

01:29:17.414 --> 01:29:20.774
and helped us avoid looking
at the brutal reality

01:29:20.854 --> 01:29:22.094
of what life is.

01:29:22.214 --> 01:29:24.254
All right, talk about
some of the characters.

01:29:24.334 --> 01:29:26.254
Some of the characters.

01:29:26.334 --> 01:29:28.534
Who can forget his Tom Jones
impression?

01:29:29.734 --> 01:29:30.814
Who can forget that?

01:29:30.894 --> 01:29:33.454
Think I better die now.

01:29:33.574 --> 01:29:34.894
You could say that.

01:29:34.974 --> 01:29:37.054
Think I better die now.

01:29:37.134 --> 01:29:38.414
- That's good.
- Yeah. I know.

01:29:38.534 --> 01:29:41.014
Well, I'll take over
when you're...

01:29:41.134 --> 01:29:42.694
I'll do plenty of Tom Jones
when you're dead.

01:29:42.814 --> 01:29:43.694
Don't worry about that.

01:29:43.774 --> 01:29:46.214
Hoo.

01:29:46.294 --> 01:29:47.534
Oh, well, thank you.

01:29:47.654 --> 01:29:49.094
Oh, you're welcome.

01:29:49.214 --> 01:29:50.374
But there'll be affection there.

01:29:50.454 --> 01:29:54.254
I'd... I would never
stick the knife in.

01:29:54.374 --> 01:29:56.494
I might just, like,
tickle you with a knife.

01:29:56.614 --> 01:29:57.694
That's all good sport.

01:29:57.774 --> 01:29:59.534
Exactly. Exactly.
Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.

01:29:59.654 --> 01:30:01.454
Should it go the other way.

01:30:01.534 --> 01:30:03.374
It's okay. We don't...
I'm not asking you to do that.

01:30:03.494 --> 01:30:04.334
Let's move on.

01:30:07.574 --> 01:30:08.974
No, I'm just saying,
if it did...

01:30:09.094 --> 01:30:10.494
- Yeah, that's all right.
- I would be...

01:30:10.574 --> 01:30:11.854
That's okay.
I don't need to know.

01:30:11.934 --> 01:30:14.254
I'd rather that it be a mystery.

01:30:17.174 --> 01:30:18.334
Oh, don't run it.

01:30:18.414 --> 01:30:20.054
- What? What?
- Don't run!

01:30:20.174 --> 01:30:22.414
- Why?
- There'll be moss.

01:30:22.494 --> 01:30:23.734
Fucking hell.

01:30:23.854 --> 01:30:25.654
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:30:25.774 --> 01:30:30.414
You've got stuck halfway
towards your destination!

01:30:30.534 --> 01:30:32.934
You're stuck in a metaphor!

01:30:33.054 --> 01:30:35.974
I'm not.

01:30:36.094 --> 01:30:38.374
You'll... Ooh!
Ooh!

01:30:41.574 --> 01:30:42.774
Oh, fuck!

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:47.774
Fuck.

01:30:47.854 --> 01:30:49.574
It's a metaphor!

01:30:49.654 --> 01:30:53.774
It's not a metaphor!
Fuck.

01:30:53.854 --> 01:30:55.214
Fuck.

01:30:57.774 --> 01:30:59.894
You looked at home
in the water.

01:31:00.014 --> 01:31:02.014
I could see you
perhaps branching out

01:31:02.094 --> 01:31:03.654
into more action roles.

01:31:15.374 --> 01:31:16.974
How come you've left
your black pudding?

01:31:17.094 --> 01:31:20.094
I don't dislike it,
but I'm never sure about it.

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:22.854
I just naturally don't go to it.

01:31:22.934 --> 01:31:24.374
That's 'cause there's
risk involved.

01:31:24.494 --> 01:31:25.694
There's a taboo.

01:31:25.774 --> 01:31:27.734
Mmm. Mmm!

01:31:29.454 --> 01:31:31.134
This is just...

01:31:31.214 --> 01:31:33.494
really...

01:31:33.614 --> 01:31:36.334
glorious.

01:31:36.414 --> 01:31:39.694
A sunny day in England
with a fried breakfast.

01:31:39.774 --> 01:31:41.454
It doesn't get much better.

01:31:41.534 --> 01:31:43.654
This is nice, but if I'm being
very honest with you,

01:31:43.734 --> 01:31:46.054
I'm looking forward
to being home now.

01:31:46.134 --> 01:31:47.254
You and me both.

01:31:47.374 --> 01:31:51.094
The most important thing
to me is that I have...

01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:55.294
that my children are healthy,
that I am healthy so...

01:31:55.374 --> 01:31:57.134
That's more important
than any work,

01:31:57.254 --> 01:31:58.974
any award, anything like that.

01:31:59.054 --> 01:32:00.814
That actually puts everything
in perspective.

01:32:00.894 --> 01:32:02.774
I dare say you'd throw away
all your awards if it...

01:32:02.894 --> 01:32:03.734
I'd throw them in a river.

01:32:03.854 --> 01:32:05.014
If you could exchange them

01:32:05.134 --> 01:32:07.094
for knowing your children
would live a happy, long...

01:32:07.214 --> 01:32:12.334
I would happily
throw all my awards in a river,

01:32:12.454 --> 01:32:13.414
not the sea.

01:32:13.534 --> 01:32:14.894
Corrosion.

01:32:14.974 --> 01:32:17.054
No, they're gonna corrode,
but if I threw them in a river,

01:32:17.134 --> 01:32:18.334
if push came to shove,

01:32:18.414 --> 01:32:21.854
I could hire a team of
scuba divers to retrieve them,

01:32:21.934 --> 01:32:25.214
but, you know, the gesture
is the important thing.

01:32:25.294 --> 01:32:26.734
No, the family's
more important.

01:32:26.814 --> 01:32:28.654
No, family's more...
of course it is.

01:32:28.774 --> 01:32:30.494
I mean, if it was a choice
between winning an award

01:32:30.574 --> 01:32:35.534
and my child being healthy,
I would absolutely, you know...

01:32:35.654 --> 01:32:38.494
Other way around, what if...

01:32:39.894 --> 01:32:43.814
If you were to allow
your child to have an illness,

01:32:43.894 --> 01:32:46.574
you could win, say, a BAFTA.

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:48.014
You could have a film BAFTA if...

01:32:48.134 --> 01:32:49.734
an illness the child
would recover from

01:32:49.854 --> 01:32:50.934
but would have some discomfort.

01:32:51.054 --> 01:32:52.294
- No.
- Yeah?

01:32:52.374 --> 01:32:53.454
That's a disgusting idea.

01:32:53.574 --> 01:32:55.214
Let me up the stakes.

01:32:55.334 --> 01:32:58.214
Oscar, best actor.

01:32:58.334 --> 01:32:59.334
Eh, best actor, Steve.

01:32:59.454 --> 01:33:02.294
What, for having an ill child?
Of course not.

01:33:02.414 --> 01:33:05.374
- Not to...
- What kind of illness?

01:33:07.054 --> 01:33:08.494
Appendicitis.

01:33:09.854 --> 01:33:10.734
What, I mean...

01:33:10.814 --> 01:33:12.734
So they get...
"Oh, my stomach.

01:33:12.814 --> 01:33:14.414
Oh, my stomach's really hurt.
Where's Dad?"

01:33:14.534 --> 01:33:15.614
"Oh, he's on location."

01:33:15.694 --> 01:33:17.294
"It's really hurting,
really hurting, ah."

01:33:17.414 --> 01:33:18.614
Doctor comes in.
Off to hospital.

01:33:20.334 --> 01:33:22.294
"Ooh, I'm weak."
Then they're better.

01:33:22.414 --> 01:33:23.414
Meanwhile,

01:33:23.534 --> 01:33:27.614
"Academy Award winner,
Steve Coogan."

01:33:31.974 --> 01:33:35.174
Hmm?

01:33:35.254 --> 01:33:37.774
Ah, now we glimpse
the real man.

01:33:37.894 --> 01:33:39.494
What do you mean?
I'm just... what do you mean?

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:42.774
I'm thinking about it.
I was thinking it through.

01:33:42.894 --> 01:33:46.374
I think the answer's probably
I still wouldn't, probably.

01:34:08.174 --> 01:34:11.014
- Very nice.
- Yeah, lovely.

01:34:11.094 --> 01:34:12.494
Lovely place to grow up,
you know?

01:34:18.534 --> 01:34:19.814
Hello.

01:34:19.894 --> 01:34:21.694
Hello.

01:34:21.774 --> 01:34:22.934
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

01:34:23.054 --> 01:34:24.694
- Hello.
- This is Rob.

01:34:24.814 --> 01:34:26.214
- Lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to see you.

01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:27.334
- Come in.
- Thank you very much.

01:34:27.454 --> 01:34:28.934
- This is Molly.
- Nice to see you.

01:34:29.014 --> 01:34:30.374
- Hey.
- Oh, what a lovely house.

01:34:30.454 --> 01:34:32.294
Are you all right?
Oh, that's all right.

01:34:32.374 --> 01:34:33.334
Hello.

01:34:33.454 --> 01:34:34.774
This is Bernard, me dad.
This is Rob.

01:34:34.894 --> 01:34:35.814
Nice to meet you.

01:34:35.934 --> 01:34:37.774
Just saying
what a lovely house it is.

01:34:37.894 --> 01:34:39.094
Rob Brydon off the telly.

01:34:39.214 --> 01:34:41.374
Oh, there he is straightaway.
Look. Hall of fame.

01:34:42.654 --> 01:34:44.054
Yeah.

01:34:44.174 --> 01:34:45.974
Ooh, and a daughter.
She's a bonnie lass.

01:34:46.094 --> 01:34:48.214
That's not a daughter.
That's our Steven.

01:34:48.334 --> 01:34:50.174
Yeah, he's just trying
to be funny.

01:34:50.254 --> 01:34:51.894
Making a joke, yeah.

01:34:52.014 --> 01:34:53.574
Well, he is funny, isn't he?

01:34:53.694 --> 01:34:54.654
Well, on occasions.

01:34:54.734 --> 01:34:56.014
I'll go make the tea.

01:34:56.094 --> 01:34:57.374
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.

01:34:57.454 --> 01:34:58.494
Oh, this is great.

01:34:58.574 --> 01:35:01.334
- Come on through into...
- Oh, a conservatory.

01:35:01.454 --> 01:35:02.654
Into the garden.

01:35:02.734 --> 01:35:04.694
- No, not the conservatory.
- No politics, thank you.

01:35:09.414 --> 01:35:11.494
All right.
Here we are.

01:35:11.614 --> 01:35:13.054
Tea for the troops.

01:35:13.134 --> 01:35:14.934
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

01:35:15.054 --> 01:35:16.574
This really is excellent.

01:35:16.654 --> 01:35:19.374
Crikey. Crikey. Crikey. Gosh.
This is excellent.

01:35:19.494 --> 01:35:21.894
I've been to <i>Four Weddings</i>
<i>and a Funeral</i> recently,

01:35:22.014 --> 01:35:25.574
and I've not had, gosh, quite
such a substantial brew.

01:35:25.654 --> 01:35:27.214
Oh, dear.

01:35:27.334 --> 01:35:29.214
That's how you started,
didn't you, Steve?

01:35:29.294 --> 01:35:30.614
- It is, yeah.
- With impressions.

01:35:30.734 --> 01:35:32.574
Moved on now?

01:35:32.654 --> 01:35:34.014
Well, yeah.

01:35:34.094 --> 01:35:35.494
Quit while you're ahead,
you know?

01:35:35.574 --> 01:35:37.654
It was a shock to all of us
when he started performing.

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:40.294
We thought it would be Deborah
or Martin, you know.

01:35:40.374 --> 01:35:42.094
They were always the funny ones,
weren't they?

01:35:42.214 --> 01:35:44.054
Yeah, you were always
the quiet one, weren't you?

01:35:44.174 --> 01:35:45.734
Well, I was in my own
little world, you know,

01:35:45.854 --> 01:35:47.334
sort of, you know, escape.

01:35:47.414 --> 01:35:48.694
I was a daydreamer.

01:35:48.814 --> 01:35:51.694
I used to daydream
constantly as a kid, you know,

01:35:51.814 --> 01:35:54.694
growing up in New York,
and I never thought, you know,

01:35:54.774 --> 01:35:57.134
I'd ever become
a great comedian, you know?

01:35:57.254 --> 01:35:59.374
I just never figured I would,
you know, and...

01:35:59.494 --> 01:36:03.094
whereas I, when
I was growing up in Edinburgh,

01:36:03.214 --> 01:36:05.174
you know, before I became
Commander James Bond,

01:36:05.294 --> 01:36:07.774
for me,
I was quite withdrawn also.

01:36:07.854 --> 01:36:08.934
I, on the other hand,

01:36:09.014 --> 01:36:10.734
grew up in the East End
of London,

01:36:10.854 --> 01:36:13.454
and all I ever wanted to do
was blow the bloody doors off.

01:36:13.574 --> 01:36:15.254
I've had to put up
with this all week.

01:36:15.374 --> 01:36:18.614
Must be exhausting, keeping
all this going all the time.

01:36:18.734 --> 01:36:19.654
Exhausting for everyone.

01:36:19.734 --> 01:36:21.254
Listen, why don't you
stop for lunch?

01:36:21.374 --> 01:36:22.734
Yes, that would be lovely.

01:36:22.854 --> 01:36:24.774
Well, we should push on,
really.

01:36:24.854 --> 01:36:25.974
Oh.

01:36:26.094 --> 01:36:27.574
What route are you taking?

01:36:27.694 --> 01:36:31.654
The... well,
getting on the M60 clockwise

01:36:31.734 --> 01:36:34.654
and then on the M56, M6.

01:36:34.734 --> 01:36:37.854
- You want to watch that.
- Why?

01:36:37.934 --> 01:36:40.094
There's road works all the way
from junction 24 to 27.

01:36:40.174 --> 01:36:42.014
It's terrible.

01:36:42.094 --> 01:36:44.094
You'd be better off
going anti-clockwise.

01:36:44.174 --> 01:36:46.294
Right. Okay. Yeah.

01:36:46.414 --> 01:36:48.054
Yes, well, it's as broad
as it's long, isn't it?

01:36:48.174 --> 01:36:51.014
- So, yeah, I'll do that.
- Good. Good.

01:36:51.094 --> 01:36:52.414
- Really nice to meet you.
- God bless.

01:36:52.494 --> 01:36:53.574
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
- Cheerio.

01:36:53.694 --> 01:36:56.814
- Bye-bye.
- All right, see you, Mum.

01:36:56.894 --> 01:36:58.454
How's Mischa?

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:01.294
She's in America at the moment,
yeah.

01:37:01.374 --> 01:37:02.814
Oh, we thought
she'd be coming with you.

01:37:02.894 --> 01:37:03.934
I know.

01:37:04.014 --> 01:37:05.334
We're going through
a bit of a hiatus.

01:37:05.454 --> 01:37:06.374
Oh, dear.

01:37:06.494 --> 01:37:07.814
Rob's the substitute
girlfriend.

01:37:07.894 --> 01:37:09.534
Oh, I hope not.

01:37:11.294 --> 01:37:12.574
How's work?
Anything coming up?

01:37:12.654 --> 01:37:15.734
Yeah, I've got a TV series
in America possibly, so...

01:37:15.854 --> 01:37:17.374
- Really?
- Great.

01:37:17.454 --> 01:37:18.494
Well, it would mean

01:37:18.574 --> 01:37:20.094
spending a lot of time
over there, though.

01:37:20.174 --> 01:37:21.374
That's the problem.

01:37:21.454 --> 01:37:23.534
If you need anybody
to carry your bags around.

01:37:23.654 --> 01:37:25.414
All right. Okay.
See ya, Dad.

01:37:25.494 --> 01:37:27.454
Right. Yeah.

01:37:27.534 --> 01:37:28.494
Oh, bye.

01:37:28.614 --> 01:37:30.014
Now, listen, you take care
of yourself.

01:37:30.094 --> 01:37:31.374
It's okay.
Nothing to worry about.

01:37:31.494 --> 01:37:32.654
- All right.
- Everything's fine.

01:37:32.774 --> 01:37:33.614
Bye, love. Bye.

01:37:33.734 --> 01:37:34.574
See ya.

01:37:34.694 --> 01:37:36.294
- Car's locked.
- What?

01:37:36.374 --> 01:37:37.294
Locked.

01:37:37.414 --> 01:37:40.214
Oh, sorry.
I thought I pressed it.

01:37:50.574 --> 01:37:51.894
Bye.

01:37:56.014 --> 01:37:58.814
Come on, let's get in.

01:38:01.294 --> 01:38:03.494
So have you made a decision
about America?

01:38:03.574 --> 01:38:05.614
Will you stay, or will you go?

01:38:05.734 --> 01:38:07.774
I'm not gonna...
I don't know.

01:38:07.854 --> 01:38:09.894
I love Mischa,
and I want to be with her,

01:38:10.014 --> 01:38:13.294
but... I don't really want
to talk about it, to be honest.

01:38:13.374 --> 01:38:15.494
You don't want
to talk about it.

01:38:15.574 --> 01:38:17.414
You want to talk about
things you've gone through?

01:38:17.494 --> 01:38:18.574
No. No.

01:38:18.694 --> 01:38:20.174
Though it's hurting me,
now it's history.

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:23.534
# Now it's history #

01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:27.174
both: # I've played
all my cards #

01:38:27.254 --> 01:38:30.774
# And that's
what you've done too #

01:38:30.894 --> 01:38:34.094
# Nothing more to say #

01:38:34.214 --> 01:38:38.054
# No more ace to play #

01:38:38.174 --> 01:38:40.974
# Tell me, does she kiss #

01:38:41.054 --> 01:38:43.654
# Like I used to kiss you? #

01:38:43.774 --> 01:38:45.614
That's a shiver down my arms
whenever I hear that...

01:38:45.694 --> 01:38:46.574
Thank you.

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:47.894
both: # Does it feel the same #

01:38:48.014 --> 01:38:51.574
# When she calls your name? #

01:38:51.694 --> 01:38:53.774
# I was in your arms #

01:38:55.974 --> 01:38:57.014
# Thinking I belonged there #

01:38:57.134 --> 01:38:58.254
# Thinking
I'd be strong there #

01:38:58.374 --> 01:38:59.934
Belonged there. Belonged there.

01:39:00.014 --> 01:39:02.054
- # Building me a fence #
- I figured...

01:39:02.174 --> 01:39:03.294
both: # Figured it made sense #

01:39:03.374 --> 01:39:05.654
# Building me a fence #

01:39:05.774 --> 01:39:07.534
# Ah, ah, ah, ah #

01:39:07.614 --> 01:39:10.894
both: # Building me a home #

01:39:11.014 --> 01:39:12.054
# Thinking I belong... #

01:39:12.174 --> 01:39:14.214
# Thinking I'd be
strong there #

01:39:14.334 --> 01:39:16.014
# Ah, ah, ah, ah #

01:39:16.094 --> 01:39:16.974
# But I was a fool #

01:39:17.054 --> 01:39:18.174
# Fool #

01:39:18.254 --> 01:39:20.774
both: # Playing by the rules #

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:24.934
# The winner takes it all #

01:39:25.014 --> 01:39:28.534
# The winner
takes it all #

01:39:28.654 --> 01:39:31.974
# The winner takes it all #

01:39:32.094 --> 01:39:33.374
# The winner #

01:39:33.454 --> 01:39:34.734
# Takes #

01:39:34.854 --> 01:39:35.694
# It #

01:39:35.814 --> 01:39:40.334
# All #

01:39:40.414 --> 01:39:42.214
Wow. Wow. I was up there.

01:39:42.294 --> 01:39:43.174
Yeah.

01:39:43.254 --> 01:39:44.174
I was up there.

01:39:44.254 --> 01:39:45.414
I think you strained
a little bit.

01:39:45.534 --> 01:39:46.454
I did strain. I did strain.

01:39:46.574 --> 01:39:47.654
But I have a wonderful range.

01:39:47.774 --> 01:39:49.654
- People... I could have done opera.
- How many octaves?

01:39:49.774 --> 01:39:51.654
I don't know. Five. Five.

01:39:51.734 --> 01:39:53.974
- Five? Five?
- How much is an octave?

01:39:54.094 --> 01:39:55.014
All right, two.

01:39:55.134 --> 01:39:57.854
Two... Pavarotti struggles
to do five.

01:39:57.934 --> 01:39:58.814
One. One. I do one.

01:39:59.854 --> 01:40:01.854
Three.
I don't know...

01:40:01.934 --> 01:40:03.654
I don't know how much
an octave is.

01:40:03.734 --> 01:40:05.454
Just get your lowest note.

01:40:05.574 --> 01:40:07.214
# La, low #

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:08.774
Hang on. Wait. Wait. Wait.
That's not it.

01:40:08.854 --> 01:40:10.694
- Get your lowest...
- Well, yes!

01:40:10.774 --> 01:40:13.974
# Low #

01:40:14.094 --> 01:40:14.934
Okay, do an octave up.

01:40:15.054 --> 01:40:17.334
# Oh #

01:40:17.454 --> 01:40:18.294
No, do an octave up.

01:40:18.414 --> 01:40:19.854
Well, how much is an octave?

01:40:19.974 --> 01:40:21.134
# Oh #

01:40:21.254 --> 01:40:23.014
It means just the same note,
but an octave higher.

01:40:23.094 --> 01:40:23.974
Hey, listen.

01:40:24.054 --> 01:40:25.654
# Ba, ba #

01:40:25.774 --> 01:40:26.854
That's an octave up.

01:40:26.934 --> 01:40:28.454
All right, but don't do it
as Roger Moore.

01:40:29.494 --> 01:40:30.894
# Ah #

01:40:31.014 --> 01:40:32.494
Come, come, Mr. Bond,

01:40:32.614 --> 01:40:35.014
you enjoy singing an octave
just as much as I do.

01:40:35.094 --> 01:40:37.334
When I sing an octave up,

01:40:37.454 --> 01:40:40.374
I sing it for queen and country.

01:40:40.494 --> 01:40:41.414
Although, I admit...

01:40:41.534 --> 01:40:42.694
Although, I admit,

01:40:42.774 --> 01:40:45.454
singing an octave up with you
would be a pleasure.

01:40:45.534 --> 01:40:47.854
Listen, it's do, re, mi,
fa, sol, la, ti, do,

01:40:47.974 --> 01:40:49.134
and the next "do"
is an octave up.

01:40:49.254 --> 01:40:51.654
# Do, re, mi, fa, sol,
la, ti, do #

01:40:51.774 --> 01:40:53.334
That's an octave up
from the first "do."

01:40:54.574 --> 01:41:00.174
# Do, re, mi, fa, sol,
la, ti, do #

01:41:00.294 --> 01:41:01.374
No. What?
Do...

01:41:01.454 --> 01:41:05.814
# Do, re, mi, fa, sol,
la, ti, do #

01:41:05.934 --> 01:41:10.134
# Do, re, mi, fa, sol,
la, ti #

01:41:10.254 --> 01:41:12.614
# Do #

01:41:12.694 --> 01:41:14.414
Three.

01:41:14.494 --> 01:41:16.534
Three. Three.

01:41:19.454 --> 01:41:22.454
# Do, do #

01:41:22.574 --> 01:41:24.334
# Do #

01:41:24.414 --> 01:41:27.494
- # Do, re, mi #
- Terry Wogan is doing it now.

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:29.614
# Do, do, do #

01:41:29.734 --> 01:41:31.774
They'll be doing
the floral dance.

01:41:31.854 --> 01:41:33.014
# Do #

01:41:33.134 --> 01:41:34.894
# Re, mi, fa, sol,
la, ti, do #

01:41:34.974 --> 01:41:36.014
# Re, mi, fa,
sol, la, ti, do #

01:41:36.134 --> 01:41:36.974
# Re, mi, fa, sol #

01:41:37.094 --> 01:41:38.174
# La, ti #

01:41:38.254 --> 01:41:39.294
That's not... that's...

01:41:39.374 --> 01:41:41.654
# Ti #
Oh, fuck.

01:41:41.774 --> 01:41:42.814
You're terrible.

01:41:42.894 --> 01:41:44.534
Terrible.

01:41:44.654 --> 01:41:46.054
I beat you. I beat you.
I beat you.

01:41:46.134 --> 01:41:48.094
I... yeah.

01:42:02.894 --> 01:42:07.294
You all right with the...
you all right with your bags?

01:42:07.374 --> 01:42:09.054
- All right.
- Well, thank you very much.

01:42:09.134 --> 01:42:10.014
Thank you very much.

01:42:10.094 --> 01:42:11.374
Really appreciate
you doing this.

01:42:11.494 --> 01:42:13.294
- Cheers.
- All right.

01:42:13.414 --> 01:42:15.334
- Let's have a hug.
- Okay. All right.

01:42:15.414 --> 01:42:17.254
Ah.

01:42:17.334 --> 01:42:18.214
Really good. Really good.

01:42:18.294 --> 01:42:19.174
No, no, I enjoyed it a lot.

01:42:19.254 --> 01:42:20.134
And then, yeah.

01:42:20.214 --> 01:42:22.094
All right, you're a good bloke.

01:42:22.174 --> 01:42:23.534
I don't care
what they say about you.

01:42:24.574 --> 01:42:26.414
- I'll see you.
- Okeydoke.

01:42:26.534 --> 01:42:29.934
Give me a ring, and we'll,
you know, we'll get together.

01:42:30.054 --> 01:42:32.054
- All right, mate.
- We could... all right.

01:42:32.174 --> 01:42:33.454
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

01:42:38.134 --> 01:42:39.614
- Ah.
- Hello.

01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:42.694
The traveler returns.

01:42:42.814 --> 01:42:44.294
Oh.

01:42:44.414 --> 01:42:45.294
Hello.

01:42:45.374 --> 01:42:46.254
Mm, sorry.

01:42:46.334 --> 01:42:48.214
I've missed you.

01:42:48.334 --> 01:42:49.174
We both missed you.

01:44:17.574 --> 01:44:19.174
So how was he?

01:44:19.294 --> 01:44:21.054
He was his usual self.

01:44:22.094 --> 01:44:23.054
His usual self.

01:44:36.494 --> 01:44:38.054
<i>This is Mischa.</i>

01:44:38.174 --> 01:44:39.614
<i>Shut up.</i>

01:44:39.694 --> 01:44:40.774
<i>I'm Steve.</i>

01:44:40.894 --> 01:44:41.774
Mm.

01:44:41.854 --> 01:44:44.174
This is delightful.

01:44:44.294 --> 01:44:45.934
One of the most
delightful meals,

01:44:46.054 --> 01:44:50.814
one of the most delightful
homecomings I've ever enjoyed.

01:44:52.334 --> 01:44:57.134
Oh, well, it did stick
to the bottom of the pan a bit...

01:44:57.254 --> 01:44:59.534
- Did it?
- Yeah.

01:44:59.614 --> 01:45:01.894
Yes, might have to
give you a bloody good spanking.

01:45:01.974 --> 01:45:03.054
In fact, I was rather hoping

01:45:03.174 --> 01:45:06.214
I might stick to the bottom
of your pan later.

01:45:15.054 --> 01:45:17.654
<i>You've reached the office</i>
<i>of Matt Jacobs at WP.</i>

01:45:17.774 --> 01:45:19.854
<i>Neither Matt nor his assistant</i>
<i>are here to answer your call.</i>

01:45:19.974 --> 01:45:21.174
<i>Please leave Matt a message,</i>

01:45:21.294 --> 01:45:22.774
<i>and he will get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as he can.</i>

01:45:22.894 --> 01:45:23.734
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:45:23.854 --> 01:45:24.734
beep!

01:45:24.814 --> 01:45:25.694
Hi, Matt.

01:45:25.774 --> 01:45:26.894
This is Steve calling

01:45:27.014 --> 01:45:29.294
just to say
I've thought it over,

01:45:29.374 --> 01:45:33.614
and I'm not gonna do
the HBO pilot.

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:35.654
I'm not gonna spend
seven years in the U.S.

01:45:35.774 --> 01:45:38.574
I've got kids.

01:45:38.654 --> 01:45:41.014
Yeah, that's it.
Bye.

01:45:41.134 --> 01:45:43.694
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:45:43.814 --> 01:45:46.214
I don't like
being away from you.

01:45:46.334 --> 01:45:48.654
No, I don't like
you being away from me.

01:45:49.694 --> 01:45:50.574
Oh.
Hello, there we are.

01:45:50.654 --> 01:45:51.534
There we go.

01:45:51.614 --> 01:45:55.174
All present and correct.

01:46:00.374 --> 01:46:04.774
I think three days
should be the maximum

01:46:04.854 --> 01:46:06.054
that I stay away for.

01:46:06.134 --> 01:46:07.734
Mm-hmm.

01:46:07.854 --> 01:46:10.094
Not this long.
