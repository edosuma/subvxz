00:18.143 --> 00:20.259
John Donovan's execution
in front of the world

00:20.354 --> 00:21.890
would make
a powerful statement.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.812
Now, if you're prepared
to answer for your crimes,

00:23.899 --> 00:25.515
you can save
your husband's life.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.145
Are you interested?

00:28.278 --> 00:29.734
REBECCA: Jadalla contacted me.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.529
He said that if I give myself
up to him, he'll release John.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.527
Rebecca, you're not
seriously considering this?

00:34.618 --> 00:36.700
They want to
stage my execution.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.448
They're gonna want
to kill me themselves.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.117
You wanna use
yourself as bait?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.994
And I want you to finish them off.
I'm in.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.706
Father, I came to finish
what you started.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.293
I failed you.
You did not fail.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.461
You came home.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.260
How does it feel to be
married to a monster, huh?

00:55.347 --> 00:56.803
You are the monster.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.130
I guess the only
monsters in this world

00:58.225 --> 00:59.715
are the ones who
kill Americans.

01:00.852 --> 01:04.311
Naseri was talking to
one of his men in Arabic.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.847
But I heard two
words in English.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.520
East July.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.853
East July is
a sub-heading of some folders

01:11.947 --> 01:13.858
<i>in the server at
the office of the DNI.</i>

01:13.949 --> 01:15.485
Director of
National Intelligence?

01:15.993 --> 01:18.951
Senator Donovan's kidnapping
was a blow to this country.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.320
But Rebecca lngram's capture

01:21.415 --> 01:24.123
has ramifications beyond
your passwords and codes.

01:24.543 --> 01:25.533
We need your help.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.081
Rebecca intends to surrender
herself to the terrorists

01:28.171 --> 01:29.832
in exchange for
her husband's life.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.759
Rebecca lngram's in trouble.
I need to help CTU locate her.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.552
We miss the flight,
we lose the job, Tony.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.672
Show me proof that
my husband is free and safe,

01:39.766 --> 01:41.222
and I'll walk into that field.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.425
Nasefl.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.101
Tell them to
release Donovan now.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.762
REBECCA: John's okay.
He's free.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.268
Get out of there, Rebecca.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.598
JADALLA: You're gonna
read your confession!

01:50.110 --> 01:51.475
I'm not reading anything.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.691
JADALLA: Your confession!

02:00.912 --> 02:02.243
ERIC: Rebecca!
Carter, what is it?

02:02.664 --> 02:03.904
The terrorists
may have Rebecca.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.616
<i>REBECCA: He's alive!
Bin-Khalid's alive!</i>

02:08.586 --> 02:11.204
(ERIC READING)

02:16.219 --> 02:17.880
If the terrorists left the
stadium via the west tunnel,

02:17.971 --> 02:20.383
they could be on any one of the
six roads leading from the area.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.806
KEITH: Okay, pull archive on
all six and run trace backs.

02:22.893 --> 02:23.974
That could take
a lot of manpower,

02:24.061 --> 02:25.142
to review that
amount of footage.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.139
Then grab people off
the comm desk to help!

Hlgetonit

02:30.067 --> 02:31.057
Sir...

02:33.612 --> 02:35.228
I can't get Rebecca's
voice out of my head.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.563
She was so scared.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.029
What did she mean that
Bin-Khalid is alive?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.156
Maybe she was disoriented.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.863
Maybe one of the terrorists
looked like Bin-Khalid.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.453
Or maybe she really did
see him.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.908
How is that possible?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.210
Bin-Khalid is dead.
Carter's team took him out.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.005
His body was never recovered.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.716
Forensics found
DNA traces,

02:58.470 --> 02:59.756
but they could've
got it wrong.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.129
Okay, look.
Whatever the truth is,

03:02.224 --> 03:03.385
it doesn't change
what we need to do.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.681
We need to locate
their vehicle,

03:04.768 --> 03:06.099
track them,
and recover Rebecca.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.432
Okay?
Stay on it, Mariana.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.191
Andy? I could really
use your help up here.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.231
I'm working on
something right now.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.736
This is kind of important.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.324
So is this.
Got to go.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.738
Can't you save
any of this?

03:27.833 --> 03:30.120
I'm trying, but they're
remote-erasing everything.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.414
Sir, Director Simms is on line one.
Says it's urgent.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.090
Yeah, okay.
Put him through.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.088
<i>WOMAN: Hold for
Director Simms.</i>

03:42.514 --> 03:43.879

Sir, if you're calling

03:43.974 --> 03:45.464
for an update on Rebecca,
we're still very much...

03:45.559 --> 03:47.141
I'm actually calling
to give you a heads up.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.972
A heads up? Daniel Pang is
on his way over there now.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.053
Should be there
any second.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.138
Why is he coming here?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.769
I've given him provisional status
as co-director of the CTU.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.649
From now on, any planning or decisions
are to be coordinated through him.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.521
Sir, with respect, um...

04:03.410 --> 04:04.821
I think
that's a huge mistake.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.414
Keith, you allowed Rebecca Ingram to
fall into the hands of terrorists.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.208
<i>It's obvious that you need all
the help that you can get now.</i>

04:13.295 --> 04:14.956
Sir, I'm perfectly willing
to take responsibility

04:15.046 --> 04:16.502
for everything
that's gone wrong,

04:17.007 --> 04:18.293
but Daniel's
an administrator.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.964
He has no field
experience and...

04:20.051 --> 04:22.418
VVhich is why I'm keeping
you there to fill the gaps.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.298
Sir...
My decision's final.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.423
You are to give Daniel
everything he asks for.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.507
Is that understood?

04:29.519 --> 04:30.975
Perfectly.
Good.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.184
Sir, Daniel just got here.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.019
Thank you for
your cooperation, Keith.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.563
Absolutely,
anything I can do.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.693
Daniel.
Keith.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.774
Did Director Simms
reach you?

04:44.868 --> 04:46.199
Yeah. Just got off
the phone with him.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.745
Oh, good. I just wanna let you
know I didn't lobby for this.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.285
Simms called me out of the blue
and wanted me to help out.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.490
KEITH: I appreciate that.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.499
So,uh,lguess
I need an office.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.663
Yes, we have a vacant one
up on the second floor.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.625
Actually, I was thinking about
something a bit more central.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.050
Do you mind if
I use yours?

05:05.263 --> 05:06.424
Of course not.

05:07.557 --> 05:11.425
Lisa, set Mr. Pang up
with prerogative one login.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.932
In my office.
Yes, sir.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.640
Oh, and I'll need full admin and
oversight privileges on CTU's network.

05:17.734 --> 05:21.853
As well as passwords and firewall
access to everyone's stations.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.900
We'll get you sorted out.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.776
Great. Thanks.
KEITH: Sure.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.579
What's Pang doing here?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.079
Well, I report to him now.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.088
He's here on
Director Simms' orders.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.212
One setback too many.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.381
No. That's not
why he's here.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.305
Something's going on and
Director Simms is involved.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.135
What are you talking about? (SOFTLY)
I just hacked into his server.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.344
You what?

05:55.438 --> 05:57.850
Pang is here because of what
I found on Director Simms.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.940
I'd like to talk to
you in private. Now.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.521

talked about you.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.977
Talked about you a lot,
about your missions together.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.311
So I feel like
I almost know you.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.822
She, uh, admired you.
You should know that.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.619
She considered you
a friend.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.572
I feel the same way...
Really?

06:58.084 --> 07:01.202
Well, then, you should've said
something to her about all of this.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.082
Should've stopped her!

07:04.674 --> 07:08.417
(STUTTERS) Sir, I thought
this was a good plan.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.585
You thought
it was a good plan

07:09.679 --> 07:12.046
to help her turn herself
over to these monsters?

07:12.140 --> 07:15.349
No. Listen, that wasn't
supposed to happen.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.178
She was gonna get them
to release you

and then draw Naseri out
so that I could take him down.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.056

happened with that?

07:23.193 --> 07:25.104

her alive, okay? Oh, God!

07:49.427 --> 07:53.011
I came face to face with
this Naseri and Bin-Khalid.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.305
They want the world
to see her die, Senator.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.553
Okay? They want to
put her on trial,

07:57.644 --> 08:00.432
make her confess
her so-called crimes.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.980
Okay? That's what they were trying
to do here and we stopped them,

Intelligence, Donald Simms.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.747
He kidnapped Naseri's
10-year-old daughter.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.451
Threatened to kill her
unless he gave up Bin-Khalid.

09:10.967 --> 09:11.957

09:12.927 --> 09:14.668
Naseri never
gave up Bin-Khalid.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.180
Yeah. And it looks like
they carried out their threat.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.223
We can't find any trace
of Naseri's daughter.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.260
Son of a bitch!

09:23.354 --> 09:24.890
They killed her.
ANDY: Carter, <i>listen!</i>

09:24.981 --> 09:29.020
The only reason why we know this is
because I hacked into Simms' server.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.976
They kicked me out before I
could download anything,

09:31.071 --> 09:34.780

09:35.325 --> 09:37.566

Naseri and Rebecca.

27:43.245 --> 27:46.408
She's being renditioned to an
agency black site in Xalapa.

back from that place.

Oh, I... I think I would
consider that crossing a line.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.529

that it is the enemy

28:24.620 --> 28:26.577

how you fight a war,

28:27.247 --> 28:29.329

Well, why don't we just bomb
them all, then, Don? Hmm?

I mean, they can't kill us
if they're all dead, right?

28:37.090 --> 28:39.081
That'd save some
American lives.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.384
I should have thought that
being married to Rebecca

28:42.471 --> 28:44.053
would have opened
your eyes by now.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.340
Why would you say
something like that?

28:48.435 --> 28:51.223
Because your wife understands
how the world operates.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.601

about Rebecca to know

28:55.359 --> 28:58.442
that, yes, she's willing
to push some boundaries,

28:58.779 --> 29:00.986

do what you've done.

29:12.501 --> 29:15.493

had a part in all of this?

29:15.712 --> 29:17.498
What if I told you

29:18.006 --> 29:19.542
that it was her idea?

29:23.679 --> 29:26.171
You're supposed to
call me a liar, John.

he's been taken down.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.677
Okay? You don't need
to do this anymore.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.301
Sorry.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.054
I've already been paid.

42:03.062 --> 42:05.770
I always finish a job
once I've been paid.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.223
I got a reputation
to keep.

42:09.736 --> 42:11.647
I won't let you
take the girl.

42:13.448 --> 42:14.779
Then we got a problem.

42:16.159 --> 42:18.947
Listen to me.
Do yourself a favor,

42:19.704 --> 42:23.288
put your weapon down
and give yourself up.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.574
We can hash this out
like adults.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.503
You hear me?

42:35.219 --> 42:37.802
This is your only chance
of living through all of this.

42:38.014 --> 42:39.095
I'm scared.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.051
(SNIFFS) It's okay.

42:41.142 --> 42:42.132
All right? It's okay.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.975
(SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

42:44.353 --> 42:46.469
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

42:46.773 --> 42:47.763
Okay?

42:49.067 --> 42:50.057
(SNIFFS)

42:51.444 --> 42:53.026
I need an answer!

43:00.870 --> 43:04.204
Whoever this guy is,
he can't cover both doors.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.123
We're taking him down.

43:07.210 --> 43:08.371
Let's move.

43:12.673 --> 43:15.165
You come in, you die!

43:16.010 --> 43:17.171
(BEEPING)
