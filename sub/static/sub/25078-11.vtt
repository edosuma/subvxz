--->   Skeebdo.com

00:31.620 --> 00:35.291
Away from all land

00:35.499 --> 00:37.543
the ocean.

00:38.252 --> 00:42.840
It covers more than half the surface
of our planet

00:42.875 --> 00:47.428
and yet for the most part
it is beyond our reach.

00:50.264 --> 00:53.726
Much of it is virtually empty

00:54.561 --> 00:57.272
a watery desert.

01:02.319 --> 01:09.743
All life that is here
is locked in a constant search to find food

01:10.202 --> 01:13.789
a struggle to conserve precious energy

01:13.824 --> 01:17.001
in the open ocean.

01:36.229 --> 01:39.573
The biggest of all fish

01:39.608 --> 01:44.321
thirty tons in weight,
twelve meters long

01:44.356 --> 01:47.241
a whale shark.

01:47.741 --> 01:54.832
It's huge bulk is sustained by
mere microscopic creatures of the sea

01:54.874 --> 01:57.084
Plankton.

01:58.419 --> 02:02.757
Whale sharks cruise on regular habitual routes

02:02.792 --> 02:06.511
between the best feeding grounds.

02:09.931 --> 02:13.810
In February,
that takes them to the surface waters

02:13.852 --> 02:17.397
far from the coast of Venezuela.

02:20.025 --> 02:22.861
Others are already here.

02:23.153 --> 02:28.701
Baitfish have come for the same reason
to feed on the plankton.

02:28.784 --> 02:34.248
The whale shark has timed it's arrival
exactly right.

02:35.124 --> 02:39.921
Oddly, the tiny fish swarm around it.

02:47.262 --> 02:50.557
They're using it as a shield.

02:53.685 --> 02:58.148
Other predatory fish are lurking nearby.

03:00.567 --> 03:06.574
Yellowfin tuna.
They seem wary of the giant.

03:12.371 --> 03:18.086
The shark dives,
as if to escape from such overcrowding.

03:22.215 --> 03:27.804
Now the tuna have a chance
to attack the unprotected baitfish

03:39.483 --> 03:40.783
but then

03:40.818 --> 03:44.155
back comes the giant.

03:50.119 --> 03:54.297
It has taken a vast mouthful
of the baitfish itself.

03:54.332 --> 04:00.797
Plankton, it seems,
is not the only food for a whale shark.

04:10.641 --> 04:14.645
Both shark and tuna feast together

04:30.078 --> 04:33.248
but the tuna must be wary.

04:36.710 --> 04:41.506
Even they can end up
in the whale shark's stomach.

04:49.348 --> 04:53.978
Predators here must grab
what they can, when they can

04:54.013 --> 04:57.273
for such events do not last long.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.910
The dense shoals, on which so many depend

05:02.945 --> 05:06.908
gather only when water conditions are perfect.

05:20.756 --> 05:25.719
Many predators spend much of their time
cruising the open ocean

05:25.754 --> 05:28.681
endlessly searching.

05:32.685 --> 05:38.608
Plankton feeding rays do so,
gliding with minimum effort.

05:52.914 --> 05:56.501
The oceanic whitetip shark

05:58.295 --> 06:01.965
another energy efficient traveler.

06:03.759 --> 06:09.598
It specializes in locating prey
in the emptiest areas of the open ocean

06:09.633 --> 06:13.686
patrolling the top one hundred meters of water.

06:21.819 --> 06:26.915
Taste in water,
is the equivalent of smell in the air.

06:26.950 --> 06:32.831
An oceanic whitetip is able to detect
even the faintest trace.

06:36.001 --> 06:38.594
Small pilot fish swim with it.

06:38.629 --> 06:42.181
The shark can find prey
far more easily than they can

06:42.216 --> 06:46.387
and they'll be able to collect the scraps
from it's meals.

06:50.891 --> 06:54.360
It's long, fixed pectoral fins

06:54.395 --> 07:00.819
enable it to soar through the water,
with the least expenditure of energy.

07:05.073 --> 07:09.995
This shark has found a school
of rainbow runners.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.921
It would eat one, given the chance

07:12.956 --> 07:17.461
but rainbow runners are swift and agile
and not easily caught

07:20.631 --> 07:23.349
so, it bides it's time.

07:23.384 --> 07:29.640
There's a chance that, eventually,
it may spot a weakened fish that's catchable.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.527
The hunter

07:34.562 --> 07:37.273
endlessly waiting.

07:47.826 --> 07:50.829
Excitement far from land.

07:59.839 --> 08:04.051
A school of dolphin
five hundred strong.

08:19.442 --> 08:24.781
They've sensed there's food around,
and they're racing to catch up with it.

08:32.748 --> 08:38.169
The news has spread.
Now a number of schools are on their way.

08:51.768 --> 08:54.235
They're heading towards the Azores

08:54.270 --> 08:59.151
volcanic islands
a thousand miles west of Portugal.

09:09.536 --> 09:12.915
The dolphin scan the water ahead
with their sonar.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.710
They're close to their target.

09:23.801 --> 09:26.053
This is it.

09:26.088 --> 09:28.306
Scad mackerel.

09:30.642 --> 09:35.438
It's difficult for a single dolphin
to catch the fish.

09:35.897 --> 09:40.402
To avoid wasting energy
the work as a group.

09:47.117 --> 09:52.248
They drive the fish upwards,
trapping them against the surface

09:53.916 --> 09:58.129
and there,
other predators await them.

10:00.590 --> 10:03.551
Cory's shearwaters.

10:03.593 --> 10:09.182
They're waiting for the dolphin
to drive the prey closer to the surface.

10:18.692 --> 10:25.324
Now the shearwaters can dive down on them,
descending to twenty meters or more

10:29.203 --> 10:33.833
and the dolphins block the baitball's retreat.

11:04.406 --> 11:08.953
The dolphins leave
as soon as they've had their fill

11:13.082 --> 11:20.090
and, at last, the mackerel sink below
the diving range of the birds.

11:43.072 --> 11:49.495
As the Sun disappears,
a profound change takes place in the ocean.

11:50.204 --> 11:54.875
Deep water plankton
start to rise from the depths

11:54.910 --> 11:59.547
and another hungry army
prepares to receive it.

12:23.364 --> 12:26.749
Every night,
wherever conditions are right,

12:26.784 --> 12:34.167
countless millions of creatures from the deep
migrate to the surface, seeking food.

12:42.634 --> 12:46.847
A baby sailfish,
fifteen centimeters long

12:46.882 --> 12:49.892
snaps up everything in it's path.

12:49.933 --> 12:54.897
In three years' time, it'll be one of the oceans
most formidable hunters

12:54.932 --> 12:57.942
weighing sixty kilos.

12:58.275 --> 13:02.363
Just now, however,
it's very vulnerable.

13:44.616 --> 13:48.661
These manta rays are giants.

13:48.703 --> 13:53.834
Eight meters across
and weighing over two tons.

13:56.378 --> 14:04.261
The blade-like projections on either side of the head
help to steer plankton into the manta's mouth.

14:23.573 --> 14:29.287
Dawn returns, and the plankton
sinks back into the depths.

14:30.831 --> 14:35.794
If we are to follow,
we must use a submarine.

14:38.547 --> 14:45.930
As we descend into the darkness,
the pressure builds, the temperature falls.

14:48.975 --> 14:54.605
Below five hundred meters,
new, mysterious animals appear.

14:59.611 --> 15:06.618
Their bizarre shapes help them
to remain suspended in the dark space.

15:09.287 --> 15:15.127
Some resemble creatures
familiar from shallower waters

15:22.343 --> 15:26.639
others defy classification.

15:31.394 --> 15:37.692
All around, organic particles
drift downwards.

15:38.151 --> 15:45.826
Marine snow, detritus from the creatures
swarming in the sunlit waters above.

15:47.077 --> 15:52.541
The snow is food for many animals here,
like the sea spider

15:52.576 --> 15:57.213
a small relative of shrimps and crabs.

16:07.849 --> 16:15.190
Those strange leg-like appendages
are feathered, to stop it from sinking.

16:16.566 --> 16:19.993
They can also enmesh marine snow

16:20.028 --> 16:24.574
which it wipes carefully
into it's jaws.

16:39.840 --> 16:45.930
A sawtooth eel
hangs upright and motionless.

16:48.099 --> 16:53.021
Gazing ever upwards, it watches
for prey, silhouetted against the faint

16:53.056 --> 16:57.400
glimmerings of light from the surface.

17:02.614 --> 17:09.288
Days may pass before prey swims
close enough for it to strike.

17:13.751 --> 17:18.339
Farther down still,
the blackness is complete.

17:18.631 --> 17:24.637
No vestige of sunlight
can penetrate as far as this.

17:27.182 --> 17:34.231
Food is very scarce and nothing
can afford to waste any energy.

17:36.441 --> 17:40.702
A dumbo octopus simply flaps a fin

17:40.737 --> 17:47.036
no need for the jet propulsion
used by it's shallow water relatives above.

18:17.442 --> 18:23.574
The weirdest, in this world of the strange,
vampyroteuthis

18:23.609 --> 18:27.745
the vampire squid from hell.

18:31.749 --> 18:37.463
Disturb it and it only retreats
a little distance.

18:39.966 --> 18:44.971
Go after it,
and it has a special defense.

18:48.183 --> 18:52.980
To see what it does,
you must switch off the lights.

18:54.940 --> 18:59.737
The vampire squid
has lights of it's own.

19:01.322 --> 19:08.871
Bioluminescent bacteria shine from pockets
on it's arms to confuse it's predators.

19:09.372 --> 19:11.833
Are those eyes?

19:15.712 --> 19:19.153
In fact they're spots
at the end of it's mantle.

19:19.188 --> 19:22.594
A bite there,
would leave the head unscathed.

19:24.429 --> 19:32.688
The threat diminishes, and vampyroteuthis
disappears into the blackness.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.421
At last,
the sea floor.

19:50.456 --> 19:58.340
Over two miles down, the pressure here
is three hundred times that at the surface.

19:58.590 --> 20:05.889
It takes several months for marine snow
to drift down as far as this.

20:08.976 --> 20:13.272
As you travel away
from the rocky margins of the continents

20:13.307 --> 20:17.401
an immense plain stretches ahead.

20:19.570 --> 20:22.949
It extends for thousands of miles

20:22.984 --> 20:26.327
gradually sinking downwards.

20:32.417 --> 20:40.175
There are faint trails in the ooze,
signs that even here there is life.

20:46.765 --> 20:50.025
These are what made some of them

20:50.060 --> 20:55.858
sea urchins sifting the accumulating drifts.

20:59.195 --> 21:02.455
Shrimps standing on elegant tiptoe

21:02.490 --> 21:06.995
fastidiously select the particles
that appeal to them

21:14.461 --> 21:22.970
but, in the deep sea, as everywhere else
if there are grazers, there are hunters.

21:31.353 --> 21:38.236
A monkfish, almost indistinguishable
from the sand on which it lies.

21:42.407 --> 21:49.664
Why waste energy chasing around,
if you can attract prey towards you with a lure?

22:07.850 --> 22:11.395
Maybe that one was a bit big.

22:13.689 --> 22:21.322
The monkfish can wait, for days if necessary,
until the right sized meal turns up.

22:24.367 --> 22:30.040
Scavengers on the other hand,
have to move around to find their food.

22:32.417 --> 22:35.844
Crabs can detect
the faintest of tastes in the water

22:35.879 --> 22:42.052
and that helps them locate the latest body
to drift down from above.

22:42.720 --> 22:46.891
Eels are already feeding on the corpse.

22:53.106 --> 22:57.944
Isopods, like giant marine woodlice
a third of a meter long

22:57.979 --> 23:01.239
are ripping into the rotting flesh.

23:01.990 --> 23:05.494
Over the next few hours
there'll be frenzied competition

23:05.529 --> 23:09.957
between scavengers of all kinds
to grab a share.

23:39.738 --> 23:45.077
Just occasionally,
there is a gigantic bonanza.

23:53.752 --> 23:57.256
The remains of a sperm whale.

23:57.339 --> 24:00.600
It died five months or so ago.

24:00.635 --> 24:06.057
There's little left but fatty blubber
clinging to it's bones.

24:08.309 --> 24:12.147
It's flesh has nourished life
for miles around

24:12.182 --> 24:15.859
but now the feast is almost over.

24:20.197 --> 24:27.371
Spider crabs, a meter across,
still pick at the last putrid remains.

24:34.295 --> 24:40.301
A few weeks more, and nothing
will be left, but bare bones.

24:40.426 --> 24:46.474
The crabs will have to fast,
until the next carcass drifts down.

24:52.606 --> 24:57.986
But not all food
comes from the sunlit world above.

24:58.362 --> 25:05.327
The floor of the Atlantic Ocean is split in two
by an immense volcanic mountain chain

25:05.362 --> 25:11.333
that winds unbroken
for forty five thousand miles around the globe.

25:14.712 --> 25:20.677
In places, it's riven by great fissures,
from which superheated water

25:20.712 --> 25:26.224
loaded with dissolved minerals
blasts into the icy depths.

25:37.110 --> 25:45.244
Clouds of sulfides solidify into
towering chimneys, as tall as a three story house.

25:49.123 --> 25:53.461
At four hundred degrees
this scalding cocktail of chemicals

25:53.496 --> 25:58.007
would be lethally toxic
to most forms of life

25:59.467 --> 26:05.015
but astoundingly, a particular kind
of bacteria thrives here

26:05.050 --> 26:10.854
and feeding on the bacteria,
vast numbers of shrimps.

26:20.239 --> 26:23.999
So, beyond the farthest reach
of the Sun's power

26:24.034 --> 26:28.789
a rich independent community exists,
that draws all it's energy

26:28.824 --> 26:33.002
directly from the Earth's molten core.

26:47.809 --> 26:53.190
On the other side of the planet,
in the western Pacific bordering Japan

26:54.191 --> 27:02.158
the dragon chimneys, another series
of hot vents, erupting in the darkness.

27:08.289 --> 27:15.088
Here, more, but different bacteria
thrive in a similar way.

27:19.718 --> 27:24.306
And here, too, more crustaceans,
but quite different species

27:24.341 --> 27:27.976
from those around the hot vents
in the Atlantic.

27:33.899 --> 27:38.703
These are squat lobsters,
clad in furry armor

27:38.738 --> 27:43.117
jostling with one another
beside the jets of superheated water

27:43.159 --> 27:47.872
for the best places,
from which to graze on bacteria.

27:53.670 --> 27:59.342
These vents, too, like those in the Atlantic
are isolated oases

27:59.377 --> 28:05.015
so widely separated,
that each community is unique.

28:15.067 --> 28:20.907
Cross to the other side of the Pacific,
to the deep near the Galapagos Islands

28:20.942 --> 28:25.954
and there are yet other fissures venting
superheated water.

28:31.334 --> 28:36.513
One and a half miles down,
at a site known as Nine North

28:36.548 --> 28:43.555
towering chimneys support
a spectacular display of giant tubeworms.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.487
These vents
give off so much energy

28:51.522 --> 28:56.047
that some of the worms reach
three meters in length.

28:56.082 --> 29:00.573
They're the fastest growing
marine invertebrates known.

29:04.953 --> 29:11.835
All told, over fifty different species
have so far been found living here.

29:15.672 --> 29:20.934
The inhabitants of these bustling communities
may grow at speed

29:20.969 --> 29:27.852
but their existence can also be short,
for the vents do not erupt indefinitely.

29:27.887 --> 29:32.857
Suddenly, unpredictably,
they may become inactive.

29:37.153 --> 29:41.039
Nine months have passed at Nine North.

29:41.074 --> 29:45.724
What were only recently chimneys
teeming with life

29:45.759 --> 29:50.375
have turned into cold,
sterile mineral monuments.

29:53.337 --> 29:56.778
Some eddy, deep in the Earth's crust

29:56.813 --> 30:00.184
diverted the volcanic energy elsewhere

30:00.219 --> 30:05.725
and, an entire microworld was extinguished.

30:13.191 --> 30:19.531
In places, volcanoes have erupted to build
great submarine mountains.

30:19.656 --> 30:24.953
There are thought to be around
thirty thousand such volcanoes

30:24.988 --> 30:30.250
some, measured from the sea floor,
are taller than Everest.

30:35.672 --> 30:41.595
Sheer cliffs
soaring to drowned volcanic peaks.

30:52.857 --> 30:56.326
Powerful currents
sweep up the mountains' flanks

30:56.361 --> 31:01.908
transporting nutrients from deep water
towards the summits.

31:04.202 --> 31:07.129
The hard rock provides excellent anchorage

31:07.164 --> 31:12.544
for communities of great variety
and stunning color.

31:13.921 --> 31:22.263
Soft corals, several meters across
collect the marine snow as it drifts past.

31:24.056 --> 31:28.686
Whip corals stretch out into the current.

31:30.396 --> 31:35.902
Giant sponges filter nourishment
from the cold water.

31:50.292 --> 31:53.712
A richly varied community flourishes here

31:53.754 --> 32:01.304
sustained by the nutrients and detritus
in the icy currents that flow around the peak.

32:05.642 --> 32:10.063
Yet it is all blossoming
on an extinct volcano

32:10.098 --> 32:14.025
a mile below the reach of the Sun.

32:39.051 --> 32:44.786
A nautilus. It spends it's days
hiding four hundred meters down

32:44.821 --> 32:50.522
But as night falls, it ascends
up to the reefs, to look for food.

32:55.152 --> 33:02.993
It's graceful shell contains gas filled
floatation chambers, that control it's depth.

33:04.828 --> 33:10.543
It's powered by a jet of water,
squirting from a siphon

33:11.836 --> 33:18.092
but it travels shell first,
so it can't see exactly where it's going.

33:22.889 --> 33:26.608
It's nearest living relatives
are squid and octopus

33:26.643 --> 33:31.655
which, over evolutionary time,
have both lost their shells

33:31.690 --> 33:36.987
and the octopus has become
one of the nautilus' major predators.

33:37.022 --> 33:40.532
It's a master of disguise.

33:46.205 --> 33:50.126
The nautilus keeps well clear of them.

33:51.919 --> 33:56.633
It's small tentacles carry
highly developed chemical sensors

33:56.668 --> 34:02.097
which can detect traces
of both predators and prey.

34:06.935 --> 34:12.149
It uses it's water jet
to dig in the sand.

34:16.570 --> 34:23.327
Because it devotes so little energy to swimming,
it only needs a meal once a month.

34:27.915 --> 34:34.714
Got something. And just as well.
Dawn is approaching and it has to puff it's way

34:34.748 --> 34:38.842
back, to deeper waters.

34:59.615 --> 35:06.164
Thirty miles away, shoals of squid
are jetting upwards towards the surface.

35:07.123 --> 35:12.879
By night, they seek small fish
among the plankton, but they're cautious.

35:20.178 --> 35:23.473
Pacific spotted dolphin.

35:26.768 --> 35:29.980
They're guided by their sonar.

35:34.276 --> 35:40.074
The dolphin, as so often, are working
as a team, synchronizing their attacks

35:40.109 --> 35:42.785
to confuse their prey.

36:01.221 --> 36:10.231
As dawn approaches, squid and fish and plankton
retreat downwards, to shelter in the darkness.

36:36.216 --> 36:38.976
Some of these isolated volcanoes

36:39.011 --> 36:46.268
rise as much as nine thousand meters
from the sea floor, reaching close to the surface.

36:49.396 --> 36:54.318
Around these peaks
invigorated by daily sunshine

36:54.353 --> 36:59.240
marine life flourishes
in spectacular abundance.

37:07.457 --> 37:13.213
Fish crowd here, because the volcano
forces nutrients to the surface

37:13.248 --> 37:17.259
encouraging the plankton to bloom.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.705
An oceanic wanderer,
a mola mola

37:38.740 --> 37:44.704
stops by to be cleaned by reef fish,
at the sea mount edge.

37:52.087 --> 37:58.385
Butterfly-fish pluck string-like parasites
from it's flanks.

38:04.392 --> 38:09.147
The huge fish lives on jellyfish
over a thousand meters down

38:09.182 --> 38:13.067
where the water is twenty degrees colder

38:13.276 --> 38:17.864
so, a brushup near the surface,
allows it to warm up

38:17.899 --> 38:22.827
before making more deep water forays.

38:29.334 --> 38:35.841
The summit of this volcanic mountain
rises above the surface of the sea.

38:36.133 --> 38:39.101
It's Ascension Island

38:39.136 --> 38:48.521
eight hundred miles from any other land,
a welcome vital haven for long distance travelers.

38:52.150 --> 38:56.911
Frigatebirds spend months
continuously airborne at sea

38:56.946 --> 39:03.161
but at nesting time, they come to Ascension
from all over the ocean.

39:06.999 --> 39:11.712
The island's barren slopes
of volcanic ash and lava

39:11.747 --> 39:16.425
might seem to offer
perfectly good sites for a nest

39:17.051 --> 39:22.223
but the frigates choose
an even more isolated site

39:23.307 --> 39:29.939
Boatswain Bird Island,
a lonely pillar, just of Ascension's coast.

39:37.697 --> 39:42.619
Frigates are the world's lightest bird,
relative to their wingspan

39:42.654 --> 39:48.125
and they can soar for weeks on end
with minimal effort.

39:51.462 --> 39:56.926
They seem much more at home in the skies,
than in a crowded colony on land

39:56.961 --> 40:00.221
but nest, they must.

40:01.431 --> 40:07.270
They come from all over the Atlantic
to this, their only colony.

40:09.981 --> 40:12.692
There are boobys here, too.

40:17.364 --> 40:24.455
To raise their young,
seabirds worldwide seek such remote islands.

40:34.715 --> 40:38.970
Swimmers also come to Ascension to breed.

40:40.013 --> 40:44.684
A female green turtle
approaches the coast.

40:47.020 --> 40:51.107
She's not eaten once, in two months.

40:52.025 --> 40:56.405
She may have traveled one thousand miles
from her feeding grounds

40:56.440 --> 41:00.242
the greatest journey of her kind.

41:06.874 --> 41:10.968
Many others are here, too,
resting on the sandy sea floor

41:11.003 --> 41:17.135
awaiting the darkness of night,
when it'll be safer to visit the beaches.

41:22.682 --> 41:26.895
Eggs that were laid a few weeks ago,
at the start of the season

41:26.930 --> 41:29.940
are beginning to hatch.

41:41.911 --> 41:45.247
Most hatchings happen at night.

41:45.331 --> 41:50.920
Now, in the light of day,
the young are extremely vulnerable.

41:56.301 --> 42:00.096
They must get to the sea as soon as possible

42:02.015 --> 42:06.311
but their trials have only just begun.

42:18.699 --> 42:23.746
Many will drown
in the pounding waves.

42:48.063 --> 42:53.902
During the next twenty years,
the vast majority will inevitably die

42:53.944 --> 42:58.616
but those that survive will, eventually,
as their mothers did before them,

42:58.651 --> 43:03.538
return to the very same beach
where they were hatched.

43:05.039 --> 43:06.965
How they find their way back

43:07.000 --> 43:13.298
across thousands of miles of open ocean,
we still have no idea.

43:21.139 --> 43:24.351
A frigate soars.

43:24.977 --> 43:28.063
Somewhere, beneath the surface below,

43:28.098 --> 43:31.317
there is the food it must have.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.903
But where?

43:35.071 --> 43:37.330
Those that fly above the ocean

43:37.365 --> 43:42.995
must be able to read the signs
of fresh supplies, or perish.

43:45.790 --> 43:52.422
A hundred miles from the Mexican coast,
and keen eyes have spotted movement.

43:56.551 --> 44:02.891
Sailfish, three meters long,
are closing in on prey.

44:08.105 --> 44:13.194
They will only use
just enough energy to make their kill

44:13.319 --> 44:16.572
never wasting a fin stroke.

44:20.576 --> 44:25.331
Nearly a hundred sailfish have surrounded
a single school of baitfish.

44:25.366 --> 44:30.754
It's very rare to see so many
of these hunters in one place.

44:32.964 --> 44:38.554
To herd their prey,
the predators raise their huge dorsal fins.

44:56.572 --> 45:01.167
A mistimed strike by one sailfish,
could fatally damage another

45:01.202 --> 45:07.292
but each continually changes it's color,
from blue, to striped, to black

45:07.327 --> 45:13.382
that warns it's companions of it's intentions
and also confuses the prey.

45:15.717 --> 45:22.516
As the shoal is driven nearer the surface,
it comes within the range of the seabirds.

45:36.698 --> 45:42.787
Out here, in the open ocean,
there is nowhere for the baitfish to hide.

46:26.333 --> 46:30.525
Sailfish live a high octane life.

46:30.560 --> 46:34.682
To survive, they must find prey daily

46:34.717 --> 46:40.389
so their entire existence will be spent
on the move.

46:50.859 --> 46:58.783
Over ninety percent on the living space
for life on our planet, is in the oceans

46:58.867 --> 47:02.829
Home to the biggest animal that exists

47:02.864 --> 47:05.999
or has ever existed.

47:06.917 --> 47:10.462
the blue whale.

47:17.053 --> 47:20.771
Some weigh nearly two hundred tons

47:20.806 --> 47:24.978
twice the size of the largest dinosaur.

47:29.357 --> 47:36.615
Despite their great size, we still have little idea
of where they travel in the vast oceans

47:36.650 --> 47:41.495
and none at all
of where they go to breed.

48:10.650 --> 48:16.448
The largest animal on Earth
feeds almost exclusively

48:16.483 --> 48:22.246
on one of the smallest
krill, shrimp-like crustaceans.

48:22.871 --> 48:28.919
They take many tons of water into their
ballooning throats in a single gulp

48:28.954 --> 48:33.216
and sieve out what it contains.

48:38.930 --> 48:46.479
Every day, each one swallows
some four million krill.

48:48.106 --> 48:55.864
Such gargantuan harvests depend
on the continuing fertility of the oceans

48:57.699 --> 49:02.454
But global changes now threaten
the great blooms of plankton

49:02.489 --> 49:05.666
on which the whales depend.

49:07.293 --> 49:10.678
Once and not so long ago

49:10.713 --> 49:15.426
three hundred thousand blue whales
roamed the oceans

49:15.593 --> 49:21.015
now, less than three percent
of that number remains.

49:24.686 --> 49:28.655
Our planet is still full of wonders.

49:28.690 --> 49:36.031
As we explore them, so we gain
not only understanding, but power.

49:37.157 --> 49:42.378
It's not just the future of the whale
that today lies in our hands

49:42.413 --> 49:49.504
it's the survival of the natural world
in all parts of the living planet.

49:50.088 --> 49:55.301
We can now destroy,
or we can cherish.

49:57.220 --> 50:04.853
The choice is ours.
