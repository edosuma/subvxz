WEBVTT

00:06.942 --> 00:09.376
Honey, you're not actually
meeting the Queen until Sunday.

00:09.445 --> 00:12.312
- You look fine.
- Yeah, you're right.

00:13.449 --> 00:14.882
But you don't.

00:14.950 --> 00:17.248
Okay, darling, that may work
for the Backstreet Boys,

00:17.319 --> 00:19.480
but not quite my style.

00:20.222 --> 00:24.420
Now, Ms. Montana,
prior to your performance on Sunday

00:24.493 --> 00:26.120
for the Queen's granddaughter,

00:26.195 --> 00:30.256
you will be introduced
to her Royal Majesty.

00:30.332 --> 00:31.959
I'm gonna meet
the Queen, whoo!

00:32.034 --> 00:34.434
I'm gonna meet the Queen, whoo!

00:34.503 --> 00:36.835
Not if you do that, whoo!

00:38.140 --> 00:42.008
Now, when cued,
what you will do is the following.

00:42.711 --> 00:46.772
Right foot behind left heel,
knees bent, curtsy and say,

00:46.849 --> 00:48.874
"Hello, Your Majesty. "

00:48.951 --> 00:51.419
Hello, Your Majesty.

00:51.487 --> 00:55.253
- No, no, no. Lower.
- Hello, Your Majesty.

00:56.225 --> 00:58.284
No, I meant get lower.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.349
Oh.

00:59.428 --> 01:01.896
Hello, Your Majesty.

01:03.265 --> 01:05.529
I'm talking about the curtsy!

01:07.903 --> 01:09.564
Hello? Hey, Ma.

01:10.839 --> 01:12.431
Yeah, look, we're right
in the middle of rehearsing

01:12.508 --> 01:14.305
to meet the Queen. Can I...

01:14.376 --> 01:16.503
No, no, no, no. Not Latifah.

01:17.212 --> 01:20.613
Hey, Simon, when I met that Queen,
all I had to rehearse was,

01:20.682 --> 01:22.650
"What's up, girlfriend?"

01:23.619 --> 01:24.984
You get it?

01:25.721 --> 01:27.882
Yes, unfortunately I did.

01:29.258 --> 01:32.125
Ma, I'm talking about
the Queen of England.

01:32.194 --> 01:36.028
Yeah. Look, I'm kind of busy right now
so can we...

01:36.098 --> 01:38.532
Yes, I know she didn't birth me.

01:39.434 --> 01:40.901
Mamaw means well,

01:40.969 --> 01:43.199
it's just when things don't go
just the way she likes them,

01:43.272 --> 01:45.832
she can be a royal pain.

01:49.411 --> 01:50.708
The Queen's granddaughter

01:50.779 --> 01:54.112
would like her pony groomed
and brought to her room.

01:56.819 --> 02:01.722
Trust me, there's no royal pain
like the royal pain.

02:01.790 --> 02:07.228
Gwendolyn, I'll be needing a bucket
of sudsies and my pony sponge.

02:10.666 --> 02:12.395
He thinks he's got problems.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.560
Your Mamaw says
she's flying in from Tennessee.

02:14.636 --> 02:16.695
She's in a cab on the way
to the house right now.

02:16.772 --> 02:18.205
Dad, don't panic.

02:18.273 --> 02:21.401
We only left Jackson home alone
for an hour.

02:21.476 --> 02:24.001
How much damage could he do?

02:24.079 --> 02:25.569
We gotta move.

02:26.748 --> 02:28.613
Egg rolls, pizza, taquitos!

02:28.684 --> 02:30.811
I leave you at home alone for an hour
and come back

02:30.886 --> 02:34.879
and this place has turned into the
International House of Leftovers.

02:34.957 --> 02:37.687
Take it easy, Dad. It's just Mamaw.

02:37.759 --> 02:38.953
Just Mamaw?

02:39.027 --> 02:42.121
You're talking about the woman
that gave me life,

02:42.197 --> 02:44.563
and who never lets me forget it.

02:44.633 --> 02:47.693
But this time I'm not giving her
anything to complain about.

02:47.769 --> 02:50.237
- Now get rid of this.
- I'm on it.

02:53.141 --> 02:54.904
Hey, hey.

02:54.977 --> 02:56.239
Hello, people!

02:56.311 --> 02:59.075
Mamaw's cab just came up.
It's Mamaw time!

03:00.382 --> 03:01.781
Fasten your seat belts.

03:01.850 --> 03:03.681
Tip? You want a tip?

03:03.752 --> 03:05.515
If you are not gonna use deodorant,

03:05.587 --> 03:07.555
make sure your back window's
rolled down.

03:09.825 --> 03:12.020
Well, at least she's in a good mood.

03:12.094 --> 03:15.689
Now, you all just sit here and act
like you're two perfect little angels

03:15.764 --> 03:18.324
who always listen to their father.

03:19.735 --> 03:21.259
Just pretend!

03:22.804 --> 03:25.329
- What is this doing here?
- I lost the remote.

03:25.407 --> 03:27.432
I needed something
to change the channels with.

03:27.509 --> 03:28.601
Ow!

03:28.677 --> 03:31.339
Hey, give me that! Cut it out. Give...

03:31.446 --> 03:32.640
Ow, ow!

03:32.714 --> 03:35.182
Fighting over a loaf of bread?

03:41.123 --> 03:44.456
Robbie Ray Stewart,
don't you feed these children?

03:45.460 --> 03:48.395
It's a good thing
I got a purse full of hard candies!

03:48.463 --> 03:50.055
- Mamaw!
- Mamaw!

03:51.333 --> 03:53.927
Hey, Mom, it's so good to see you.

03:54.002 --> 03:56.664
Oh, it's good to see you, too,
sweetie pie.

03:56.738 --> 03:59.036
Hey, by the way,
you got a loose step outside.

03:59.107 --> 04:01.735
If we weren't blood, I would sue you!

04:07.883 --> 04:09.544
<i> Come on!</i>

04:09.618 --> 04:13.577
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

04:13.655 --> 04:17.022
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

04:17.091 --> 04:20.892
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

04:20.963 --> 04:25.991
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

04:26.068 --> 04:29.435
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

04:29.504 --> 04:34.703
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

04:34.776 --> 04:38.769
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

04:38.847 --> 04:40.644
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

04:40.716 --> 04:42.513
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

04:42.584 --> 04:46.953
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

04:47.022 --> 04:48.319
<i>Mix it all together</i>

04:48.390 --> 04:51.689
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

04:58.233 --> 04:59.495
What do you think, Ma?

04:59.568 --> 05:02.036
Your baby boy's got himself
a beach house in Malibu.

05:02.104 --> 05:06.097
Well, my, I should say,
you sure are living high on the hog.

05:06.174 --> 05:08.768
Quite a few hogs by the looks of it.

05:09.444 --> 05:12.470
So, how long you say you're staying?

05:12.547 --> 05:15.812
Oh, now, don't you worry, sweetie.
I'm only here for the weekend.

05:15.884 --> 05:20.014
You can go back to taking food out
of your children's mouths on Monday.

05:20.088 --> 05:21.248
Well, this is great, Mamaw.

05:21.323 --> 05:23.257
Now you get to come with us
to meet the Queen.

05:23.325 --> 05:25.293
Well, that sounds like fun, sweetie.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.191
Yeah, and I get to perform
my new song for her...

05:27.262 --> 05:30.754
But the real reason that I am here
is because Jackson has made it

05:30.832 --> 05:34.268
into the finals
of a big LA volleyball tournament.

05:34.336 --> 05:36.361
Oh, yeah!

05:36.438 --> 05:39.032
That reminds me,
I have got something for you.

05:39.107 --> 05:42.838
I have never been so proud
of a grandchild in my whole life.

05:46.448 --> 05:49.076
Did I mention
I was meeting the Queen?

05:49.751 --> 05:52.948
Now don't worry about it, baby doll.
Mamaw's gonna have time to do both.

05:53.021 --> 05:55.615
Queen's in the morning
and the tournament's not till afternoon.

05:55.690 --> 05:57.521
But, Daddy, she's doing it again.

05:57.592 --> 05:59.958
Every time she comes,
she treats Jackson like he's an angel

06:00.028 --> 06:01.962
and I'm invisible.

06:02.030 --> 06:05.397
Robbie Ray, put that down!
How big do you wanna get?

06:07.836 --> 06:09.064
Trust me, honey.

06:09.137 --> 06:11.799
Sometimes being invisible
has its advantages.

06:13.408 --> 06:15.399
Now, way back in '64,

06:15.477 --> 06:17.945
when this old bag of bones
was on the Olympic volleyball team,

06:18.013 --> 06:21.210
I wore my lucky wristband.

06:21.283 --> 06:23.717
Oh, this is so cool!

06:23.785 --> 06:25.343
Thanks, Mamaw.

06:26.154 --> 06:29.646
Wow, that's so great of you to bring
something so special for Jackson.

06:29.724 --> 06:33.216
Oh, well, you don't think I forgot
about you now, do you, sweetie?

06:33.295 --> 06:36.594
Let me see.
What have I got in here for you?

06:36.665 --> 06:39.065
Well, I know how much you love music,

06:39.134 --> 06:42.865
so I brought you airplane headphones!

06:44.973 --> 06:47.305
Wow! I don't know what to say.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.933
You might wanna disinfect those.

06:49.010 --> 06:51.171
I took them off the old guy
that was sitting next to me.

06:51.246 --> 06:54.374
You can make a candle
with the earwax on those things.

06:54.449 --> 06:55.848
A twofer.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:10.298 --> 07:11.822
Come on, you gotta do better than that

07:11.900 --> 07:13.868
if you're gonna be
a volleyball champion.

07:13.935 --> 07:15.664
Your Mamaw can do better!

07:15.737 --> 07:18.297
Heck, your Mamaw is doing better!

07:20.108 --> 07:23.600
Cramp in the leg. Cramp in the leg.
Oh, I'm going down.

07:24.679 --> 07:28.376
Jackson!
Oh, come on now, get up, baby.

07:28.450 --> 07:30.111
If I stop now, at my age,

07:30.185 --> 07:32.813
I'm gonna lock up
like a yarn barn at 9:00.

07:34.823 --> 07:36.950
Come on. I'll stretch you out.

07:38.126 --> 07:39.218
There you go.

07:39.294 --> 07:41.455
Embrace the pain.

07:41.530 --> 07:44.499
Yeah. You're gonna thank me
for this later.

07:46.368 --> 07:48.495
Hey, Miley, I got your message.

07:48.570 --> 07:51.562
Waxy airplane earphones?
You're kidding, right?

07:51.640 --> 07:54.609
With little gray hairs still stuck to them.

07:57.746 --> 08:01.341
I don't understand, Lilly.
I'm always nice to her.

08:01.416 --> 08:04.351
And I even complimented
her orthopedic shoes.

08:05.287 --> 08:08.313
Trust me, Lilly,
those are Frankenboots.

08:08.390 --> 08:11.359
Listen, Miley, I know you think
she might like Jackson more,

08:11.426 --> 08:12.518
but that can't be true.

08:12.594 --> 08:16.530
It is. It's like I don't exist
and she has him up on a pedestal.

08:16.598 --> 08:19.658
- Oh, come on.
- No, you come on.

08:21.303 --> 08:23.498
That's my little champion.

08:27.209 --> 08:30.303
I don't even think she wants to come
watch me perform for the Queen.

08:30.378 --> 08:32.972
I don't know, Lilly. What do I do?

08:33.048 --> 08:36.039
I have an idea!
And it's so simple, you're gonna love it!

08:36.116 --> 08:38.414
- What?
- Dump Granny and take me.

08:39.287 --> 08:40.652
No, she's going.

08:40.722 --> 08:42.553
She's going if I have to
tie her up like a deer

08:42.624 --> 08:45.559
and strap her to the hood
of my daddy's car.

08:49.130 --> 08:53.260
<i>Topher sets for Jackson. </i>
<i> Jackson leaps and right into the net!</i>

08:58.273 --> 09:01.572
What? If I'm gonna announce
the tournament, I need to practice, too.

09:01.643 --> 09:03.201
If you're gonna announce
for the tournament,

09:03.278 --> 09:05.109
you'll need to be alive!

09:09.918 --> 09:12.443
<i> Jackson takes the set from Topher</i>
<i>and... </i>

09:17.726 --> 09:21.856
Oliver, do you have the sound
of a truck running over a microphone?

09:22.464 --> 09:26.298
- Nope, I don't have that one.
- You will if you push another button.

09:27.602 --> 09:30.571
You, kiddo, you are doing great.
You just need a little more knee bend.

09:30.639 --> 09:33.767
And you, sweetheart,
you either get your head into this game

09:33.842 --> 09:37.403
or I'm gonna have a senior moment
all over your keister.

09:38.313 --> 09:39.371
Uh...

09:39.447 --> 09:41.972
I'm sorry for screwing up.
Uh, I guess I'm just a little nervous.

09:42.050 --> 09:44.518
Well, you're supposed to be.
But you are a Stewart.

09:44.586 --> 09:47.521
And Stewarts do not lose.
Now, you want this, don't you?

09:47.589 --> 09:48.886
- I do.
- Of course you do.

09:48.957 --> 09:50.219
So, stop your moping!

09:53.895 --> 09:55.988
Finger slipped.

09:56.064 --> 09:57.326
<i>My bad. </i>

09:58.633 --> 10:01.124
Come on. I'm gonna set for you.

10:01.202 --> 10:03.670
Okay, bend those knees.

10:07.342 --> 10:10.505
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

10:18.620 --> 10:20.781
One, two, three, four.

10:20.855 --> 10:21.947
<i>The other side, the other side</i>

10:23.191 --> 10:25.284
<i>The other side of me</i>

10:25.360 --> 10:29.820
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>The other side of me</i>

10:29.898 --> 10:30.887
Yeah.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.724
That was great, honey.

10:33.802 --> 10:36.270
For heaven's sake,
that woman is over three hours late.

10:36.338 --> 10:39.466
Who does she think she is,
the Queen of England?

10:39.541 --> 10:42.009
Well, it's still no excuse!

10:42.077 --> 10:44.637
She's right, I got the biggest match
of my life in an hour.

10:44.713 --> 10:46.237
I shouldn't even be here!

10:46.314 --> 10:48.282
Don't worry, Son,
it's all gonna work out.

10:48.350 --> 10:50.716
When? I'm starting to tighten up.

10:50.785 --> 10:53.117
Not good.
You want me to stretch you out again?

10:53.188 --> 10:55.179
No! I'm fine!

10:55.256 --> 10:57.986
Excuse me, but the Queen has been
delayed at the State Fair

10:58.059 --> 11:03.019
where her granddaughter washed down
chili cheese fries with a grape slushy,

11:03.098 --> 11:06.465
producing a royal
and colorful upchuck.

11:08.036 --> 11:11.995
Oh, for heaven's sake,
just hose her off and get her over here!

11:12.841 --> 11:16.038
I think what my mom's trying to say
is we got another commitment, so...

11:16.111 --> 11:18.511
Oh, not a problem.
I'll just tell the Queen

11:18.580 --> 11:21.981
you stood her up
for a monster truck jamboree.

11:22.951 --> 11:25.351
You think if there was
a monster truck jamboree

11:25.420 --> 11:28.856
anywhere within spitting distance
of this place, we'd be here?

11:28.923 --> 11:32.120
- Daddy!
- I guess we'll just wait.

11:32.193 --> 11:33.387
Duh.

11:34.662 --> 11:37.062
Well, this is crazy. We can't wait!

11:37.132 --> 11:40.966
Yo, Hamlet! You get your Queen
on the horn, asap!

11:41.035 --> 11:44.027
Ma! Get back here, Ma!

11:44.105 --> 11:47.131
You cannot give
a grown man a wedgie!

11:50.779 --> 11:53.407
She's gonna insult the Queen
and ruin my command performance

11:53.481 --> 11:55.642
all because of her little Jackson.

11:55.717 --> 11:59.653
- It's always about you.
- Me? It's never about me!

11:59.721 --> 12:02.656
Everything in this family
revolves around you!

12:02.724 --> 12:06.091
- What are you talking about?
- If it's not the Queen, it's a concert.

12:06.161 --> 12:08.254
If it's not a concert, it's a CD signing.

12:08.329 --> 12:10.763
I mean, face it, no matter
how important something is to me,

12:10.832 --> 12:13.392
it always comes in second
to Hannah Montana.

12:13.468 --> 12:15.868
Come on, Jackson.
You know that's not true.

12:15.937 --> 12:17.199
Yes, it is.

12:17.272 --> 12:19.672
- Where are you going?
- To my volleyball match.

12:19.741 --> 12:21.936
Something that's important to me!

12:22.010 --> 12:23.068
Tell the Queen I said

12:23.144 --> 12:24.941
hello!

12:30.552 --> 12:33.248
For heaven's sake, Robbie Ray,
I wasn't gonna hit him.

12:33.321 --> 12:35.221
I just wanted to give him
a little Tennessee talking to.

12:35.290 --> 12:37.690
Yeah, last time you gave someone
a little Tennessee talking to,

12:37.759 --> 12:40.387
the air marshal
made him land the plane.

12:40.462 --> 12:42.191
Ask for an extra bag of peanuts

12:42.263 --> 12:46.290
and all of a sudden
you are a threat to national security.

12:46.367 --> 12:47.857
Where is Jackson?

12:47.936 --> 12:51.372
He left for his volleyball tournament,
so I suppose you wanna go now, too.

12:51.439 --> 12:52.906
Well, if I don't, who will?

12:52.974 --> 12:56.000
I don't see either one of you
heading for the door.

12:56.077 --> 12:58.477
Ma, you don't think
we wanna be there for him?

12:58.546 --> 12:59.604
Of course we do!

12:59.681 --> 13:02.206
But we're kind of caught between
the Queen and a hard place, here.

13:02.283 --> 13:05.980
And so once again,
Jackson gets the short end of the stick.

13:06.054 --> 13:08.022
- Mom, that's not fair.
- It is too fair!

13:08.089 --> 13:09.215
Now, I know you both love him,

13:09.290 --> 13:11.121
but you're so busy
taking care of Hannah Montana,

13:11.192 --> 13:13.660
you're letting poor Jackson Stewart
fall through the cracks!

13:13.728 --> 13:15.252
Mamaw, you're so busy with Jackson

13:15.330 --> 13:17.491
you're letting me
fall through the cracks.

13:17.565 --> 13:20.033
- Oh, Miley, sweetie.
- Just forget it.

13:21.236 --> 13:23.602
No, hold up. I need to do this.

13:25.607 --> 13:27.871
Miley, sweetie.

13:27.942 --> 13:31.537
I am sorry if I made you think
that I don't care.

13:31.613 --> 13:34.013
But the truth is, I love you very much

13:34.082 --> 13:37.245
and I am so proud
of everything that you do.

13:37.318 --> 13:38.945
Really?

13:39.020 --> 13:41.011
You've never said that to me before.

13:41.089 --> 13:44.081
Well, I guess I'm so busy making sure
that Jackson gets some attention,

13:44.158 --> 13:46.319
there wasn't enough left for you.

13:46.394 --> 13:48.521
Mamaw, do you know
how that makes me feel?

13:48.596 --> 13:50.826
- Kind of invisible?
- Yeah.

13:50.899 --> 13:54.164
Maybe that's the way
your brother feels all the time.

13:54.235 --> 13:57.170
Really? He never said anything.

13:57.238 --> 13:59.103
What's he gonna say, sweetie?

13:59.173 --> 14:01.471
"Don't be Hannah Montana"?

14:01.543 --> 14:04.944
He wouldn't be a very good brother
if he said that now, would he?

14:05.013 --> 14:06.640
No, I guess not.

14:07.348 --> 14:10.875
And I guess I wouldn't be a very
good sister if I made you stay here.

14:10.952 --> 14:12.249
Go, we'll catch up with you later.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.380
I love you, kiddo.
You rock that Queen's world.

14:15.456 --> 14:17.981
I cannot wait to hear all about it.

14:18.693 --> 14:19.955
Thanks, Mom.

14:20.028 --> 14:22.189
It's nice to see the soft side of you
once in a while.

14:22.263 --> 14:23.730
I appreciate that, baby boy.

14:23.798 --> 14:25.356
And you stay away
from that dessert table

14:25.433 --> 14:28.197
or all of your sides are gonna be soft.

14:29.938 --> 14:33.135
I was a chubby child.
She could never let that go.

14:33.775 --> 14:34.969
I feel awful, Daddy.

14:35.043 --> 14:37.102
We're gonna miss Jackson
all because of me.

14:37.178 --> 14:38.805
It's not your fault.
There's nothing you can do,

14:38.880 --> 14:41.713
unless you know some way
to speed up time.

14:45.820 --> 14:49.483
Ladies and gentlemen, the Queen.

14:54.162 --> 14:58.155
Sweet mercy, that woman
makes a snail look like a cheetah.

14:58.232 --> 15:01.326
- You ready, darling?
- Let's pick it up, Daddy!

15:02.870 --> 15:05.805
Excuse me, partner,
I'll take it from here.

15:05.873 --> 15:08.205
Oh, this can't be good.

15:08.409 --> 15:10.036
Yee-ha!

15:11.713 --> 15:13.237
Walk and wave and bow and greet.

15:13.314 --> 15:15.145
Now, come on, Queenie,
move them feet!

15:15.216 --> 15:16.774
Look at your guests, give them a smile.

15:16.851 --> 15:18.284
Get the lead out, move down the aisle!

15:18.353 --> 15:20.150
Now swing that girl, give her a push.

15:20.221 --> 15:22.849
There's your seat, now plant that tush!

15:24.525 --> 15:26.857
The Queen, ladies and gentlemen!

15:28.763 --> 15:30.822
Okay, hit it, Robbie Ray!

15:33.201 --> 15:35.999
<i>By day, I play</i>
<i>the part in every way</i>

15:36.070 --> 15:37.628
<i>Yadda, yadda, yadda, sing, sing, sing</i>

15:37.705 --> 15:40.572
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>I want you to see, oh!</i>

15:40.642 --> 15:43.975
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>The other side of me</i>

15:44.045 --> 15:45.273
<i>Yeah!</i>

15:45.346 --> 15:46.472
Guitar solo!

15:47.615 --> 15:50.015
Robbie Ray,
ladies and gentlemen!

15:50.084 --> 15:54.020
You've been a beautiful audience.
Pip-pip, tah-tah, cheerio, good night!

15:55.990 --> 15:59.255
Simon, have we just been punked?

16:08.903 --> 16:11.565
There is my future champion.
What are you doing?

16:11.639 --> 16:13.573
- I have to forfeit.
- What?

16:13.641 --> 16:16.906
- Topher called, he's got the flu.
- Well, that's no excuse.

16:16.978 --> 16:19.970
Heck, during the Olympic qualifiers,
I got food poisoning.

16:20.048 --> 16:22.016
I blew chunks all over the court.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.948
The other team
was sliding all over the place.

16:24.018 --> 16:26.213
We won in a landslide.

16:26.287 --> 16:28.448
Forget it, Mamaw. He's not coming.

16:28.523 --> 16:31.549
Can you believe it?
I think I could have won this thing.

16:31.626 --> 16:34.424
And now I don't even get
the chance to try.

16:34.495 --> 16:36.725
Oh, yes, you do, young man.

16:36.798 --> 16:38.789
I did not fly all the way out here
from Tennessee

16:38.866 --> 16:40.857
just to watch you throw in the towel.

16:40.935 --> 16:45.304
- But I don't have a partner.
- You mean you didn't have a partner.

16:45.373 --> 16:48.206
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

16:51.079 --> 16:54.344
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we have a last-minute substitution. </i>

16:54.415 --> 16:56.440
<i> Jackson Stewart will now</i>
<i>be playing with the woman</i>

16:56.517 --> 16:59.008
<i>who puts the "Ruth" in "ruthless. "</i>

17:01.255 --> 17:03.519
<i>Slamming Mamaw Stewart. </i>

17:10.231 --> 17:11.528
You're kidding, right?

17:11.598 --> 17:14.329
Well, I just didn't want
my grandson to have to forfeit.

17:14.402 --> 17:17.894
So I would appreciate it
if y'all would go easy on us.

17:17.972 --> 17:19.940
Sure. No problem.

17:23.044 --> 17:25.035
<i> Jackson serves the ball. </i>

17:26.513 --> 17:28.071
<i>It's returned over the net. </i>

17:28.148 --> 17:29.207
<i> Jackson sets to Ruth. </i>

17:30.551 --> 17:31.813
<i>She spikes it home!</i>

17:35.523 --> 17:37.491
Hey, hey, hey. What was that?

17:37.558 --> 17:40.959
Well, I didn't say
we were going easy on you, slick!

17:41.929 --> 17:44.796
All right! Bring it on, Grandma!

17:44.866 --> 17:48.893
Oh, it's on. It's on.
It's on like mud on a pig.

18:21.936 --> 18:24.427
We made it!
Come on, there's some seats.

18:26.374 --> 18:27.705
Hey, y'all, what's the score?

18:27.775 --> 18:29.902
If Jackson scores the next point,
they win.

18:29.977 --> 18:32.445
Oh, my gosh! You're Hannah Montana!

18:32.513 --> 18:36.950
Lilly, you've known this for months.
Hello, get over it!

18:37.018 --> 18:39.851
No, I mean
you're Hannah Montana now!

18:40.688 --> 18:44.351
Oh, no, this is supposed to be
Jackson's big moment.

18:44.425 --> 18:47.258
Hannah Montana can't spoil it.

18:47.328 --> 18:49.296
Start crawling,
we'll get you to the stands.

18:49.363 --> 18:52.764
<i>This is it. </i>
<i> Jackson Stewart serving for the gold. </i>

18:52.834 --> 18:54.131
<i>This is, without a doubt,</i>

18:54.202 --> 18:57.194
<i>the most important serve</i>
<i>of young Stewart's life. </i>

18:57.271 --> 18:58.363
<i>If he blows this... </i>

19:01.375 --> 19:04.902
Son, you sound a whole lot better
when no one can hear you.

19:06.447 --> 19:09.041
All right, sweetie, this is it.
Just like in practice.

19:09.116 --> 19:11.914
Relax, the crowd is here for you.

19:11.986 --> 19:13.078
Everybody is here for you.

19:14.322 --> 19:15.653
Not everybody.

19:15.723 --> 19:17.156
Look again.

19:40.615 --> 19:41.673
Way to go, Jackson!

19:42.917 --> 19:43.941
Ow!

19:44.018 --> 19:48.114
- Hey, look! It's Hannah Montana!
- No, it's not!

19:48.189 --> 19:50.953
- She's under the stands!
No, I'm not!

19:57.732 --> 20:01.133
Way to go, Son.
I better go check your sister.

20:01.202 --> 20:03.067
Clear the way!

20:03.137 --> 20:04.764
Clear out!

20:04.839 --> 20:06.204
Amazing!

20:06.274 --> 20:08.970
Even when I win,
it's still about Hannah Montana.

20:09.043 --> 20:10.442
No, it is not.

20:10.511 --> 20:13.173
This is all about you, sweetie. You won.

20:13.247 --> 20:15.613
And nobody can take that
away from you.

20:15.683 --> 20:17.742
Now give me my trophy.

20:18.486 --> 20:20.351
I'm just kidding you.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.727
Jackson, I got something
I want to say to you and when I do,

20:29.797 --> 20:32.630
I don't want this caterpillar on my lip.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.430
- I'm proud of you, Son.
- Thanks.

20:35.503 --> 20:38.199
Well, why don't I give you two
some time?

20:38.272 --> 20:40.968
Besides, your grandma's
in the car alone

20:41.042 --> 20:43.510
and sooner or later
she's gonna sniff out those pork rinds

20:43.577 --> 20:45.511
I got hid under the seat.

20:49.150 --> 20:51.618
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

20:52.253 --> 20:54.221
Look, I'm sorry.

20:54.288 --> 20:55.915
I didn't mean to mess this up for you.

20:55.990 --> 20:58.424
It seems Hannah Montana
does that a lot.

20:58.492 --> 21:00.756
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

21:01.362 --> 21:03.626
I wouldn't blame you if you hated me.

21:03.698 --> 21:05.666
I don't hate you, Miles.

21:05.733 --> 21:08.293
Okay, sure I'd like
a little more attention sometimes,

21:08.369 --> 21:11.497
but at the end of the day,
I like who I am,

21:11.572 --> 21:14.006
and that's all that really counts.

21:14.475 --> 21:16.909
So you're not mad about today?

21:16.978 --> 21:19.276
My sister and my dad
blew off the Queen of England

21:19.347 --> 21:20.939
just to watch me play volleyball.

21:21.015 --> 21:23.483
How could I be mad at that?

21:23.551 --> 21:26.486
I think this is the nicest conversation
we've ever had.

21:26.554 --> 21:28.146
I know.

21:28.222 --> 21:31.282
And if you tell anybody about it,
I'll deny it.

21:32.393 --> 21:35.920
- What conversation?
- That's my little sis.

21:37.732 --> 21:39.700
Coming through!

21:39.767 --> 21:41.632
Give me back my pork rinds, Ma!

21:41.702 --> 21:43.636
If you'd quit eating
all this fried garbage,

21:43.704 --> 21:46.036
maybe you could catch me!

21:51.012 --> 21:53.344
You know, I do give Robbie Ray
a hard time,

21:53.414 --> 21:56.178
but the truth is, he is doing a great job.

21:56.250 --> 22:00.050
So, you ready to go down
like a rodeo clown?

22:01.055 --> 22:02.852
Bring it on, sister!

22:11.032 --> 22:14.297
Somebody ain't gonna be happy
when they lose.

22:14.368 --> 22:16.962
Please, Lord, let it be the Queen.

22:18.239 --> 22:20.605
Who's gonna save the Queen now?

22:22.376 --> 22:25.573
Don't hate the player. Hate the game.
