00:00.250 --> 00:01.512
Seriously stop! Seriously.
I'll smoke you out.

00:01.619 --> 00:03.678
Seriously, seriously stop!

00:05.155 --> 00:09.114
What are you doing?
Stop! No! No! Let go!

00:09.226 --> 00:12.320
You're crazy! No! No!

00:12.429 --> 00:15.262
No!
Open up.

00:15.366 --> 00:16.765
No!
Good girl.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.869
Wasn't painful, was it? 
No.

00:19.970 --> 00:21.403
In future, if you find
yourself in a situation...

00:21.505 --> 00:24.804
What are you doing?
Get the fuck... You little wanker.

00:28.712 --> 00:31.647
I just need you to go
and score for me, Aaron.

00:33.684 --> 00:35.743
We're in Vegas.
I don't know peeps out here, you know?

00:35.853 --> 00:37.480
It's not a fucking game, Aaron!

00:37.588 --> 00:40.887
Don't put yourself between me and
my problem or I'll fucking destroy you!

00:41.258 --> 00:44.853
Go on now! Why are you still here?
Why are you still here?

00:47.364 --> 00:48.922
Just calm...
Just calm down.

00:49.033 --> 00:50.625
It's not a joke!
It's not funny!

00:50.934 --> 00:53.494
Spilling my narcotics,
fucking me around!

00:53.604 --> 00:54.901
I need you to sort me out!

00:55.005 --> 00:57.974
You spilled my medicine!
You need to remedy it!

01:00.778 --> 01:02.245
This is calm.

01:02.346 --> 01:04.211
Twenty minutes ago,
I was even more calm

01:04.313 --> 01:06.145
when I had my fingers
in your asshole.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.218
You don't want to wait around
for another half-hour, son,

01:08.318 --> 01:09.512
'cause I'll be
fucking you up.

Advertise your product or brand here

01:20.831 --> 01:21.991
I'll figure it out.

01:22.099 --> 01:23.191
Yeah, you will. Yeah.

01:27.071 --> 01:28.368
Hi. Can I help you?
Yes.

01:28.472 --> 01:30.633
I am trying to look up a friend of
mine who's staying at the hotel.

01:30.741 --> 01:33.175
I don't know what room he's in.
Okay. What's the last name?

01:33.277 --> 01:35.108
It's spelled H...
Okay.

01:35.846 --> 01:42.547
...E- R-O-l-N.

01:46.490 --> 01:48.185
Can you find
that guest for me?

01:51.795 --> 01:53.763
Can you find
that guest for me?

01:54.798 --> 01:55.890
Okay, I see
what you're doing.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.067
I don't think it's funny,
to be honest with you.

01:58.435 --> 02:00.403
I mean, you come here,
you ask me for,

02:00.504 --> 02:02.529
if somebody named Heroin has
checked in the fucking hotel,

02:02.639 --> 02:04.266
'cause you wanna buy drugs
and that's how you do it?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.535
You pretend that it's the last
name of a fucking guest?

02:06.643 --> 02:07.701
Are you out of your mind?

02:10.047 --> 02:12.345
I don't know. I just,
just, just... I just...

02:12.449 --> 02:14.747
I'm looking for my friend Heroin.
Do you know him?

02:15.119 --> 02:18.611
Yeah, I do. He'll be out back of the
Spice Market Buffet in 20 minutes.

02:22.259 --> 02:24.784
I feel like I'm in
<i>2 Fast 2 Furious.</i>

02:28.632 --> 02:29.724
Yo, Brian,
give me my money

02:29.833 --> 02:31.698
or I'm gonna stab you in the fucking stomach,
all right?

02:31.802 --> 02:34.362
Get out of my room, dude.
What are you gonna do?

02:35.072 --> 02:38.940
What... I'm not,
like, involved in this.

02:39.710 --> 02:40.904
Oh, my God!

02:41.011 --> 02:42.171
Where is the hospital?

02:42.279 --> 02:44.839
You take a right
on North Casino Way!

02:45.682 --> 02:47.343
Every street's
called Casino Way!

02:52.689 --> 02:56.352
God, why didn't he take
me all the way to the door?

02:57.828 --> 02:59.557
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

02:59.696 --> 03:01.527
<i>It's just like</i>
<i>coming in the back door</i>

03:01.632 --> 03:04.965
<i>Five, six, seven, eight</i>
<i>Feels great</i>

03:05.202 --> 03:09.536
<i>A ring, a ring</i>
<i>around my dirty posie</i>

03:09.640 --> 03:12.939
<i>My rear pocket is so</i>
<i>fit and so damn cozy</i>

03:13.043 --> 03:16.535
<i>Ring, ring,</i>
<i>ring around my posie</i>

03:17.748 --> 03:19.045
<i>All the boys in town say</i>
<i>I've the tautest of posies</i>

03:19.149 --> 03:20.309
Aldous.

03:22.219 --> 03:25.279
I couldn't get what
you wanted me to get.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.582
Sorry.

03:29.927 --> 03:31.258
Yeah, I forgot
I asked you to do that.

03:31.728 --> 03:33.389
No, that's all sorted.

03:33.697 --> 03:36.325
Turns out,
it's quite easy to get drugs in Las Vegas.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.300
Why do you look
so flustered?

03:40.671 --> 03:42.138
All right, just change and we'll get going,
shall we?

03:43.106 --> 03:44.437
Looking forward
to seeing me dad.

03:44.541 --> 03:46.634
Thanks again for
the suggestion.

03:46.743 --> 03:47.710
Great.

03:48.078 --> 03:53.015
<i>By posie,</i>
<i>I'm talking about my asshole</i>

03:53.116 --> 03:54.447
<i>Jackie Q!</i>

04:30.354 --> 04:34.017
When Frank Sinatra moves his arm,
you can see my dad. There. There!

04:42.499 --> 04:45.297
What about... What was that
fucking album you brought out last?

04:45.402 --> 04:48.428
It was... What was it?
African something or Zambezi,

04:48.538 --> 04:50.199
or what was it?
<i>African Child.</i>

04:50.307 --> 04:52.935
Child. Child. Yeah, yeah,
<i>African Child.</i>

04:53.043 --> 04:54.840
You should have stayed away from that one,
I think.

04:54.945 --> 04:58.437
I think you should've aborted that child, eh?
You got that?

04:59.016 --> 05:00.415
You know, mate?

05:01.952 --> 05:03.317
I loved it.

05:03.420 --> 05:05.547
She loved it, yeah.
Yeah. She really did.

05:05.656 --> 05:06.884
No, she told me
that she loved it.

05:06.990 --> 05:08.719
Yeah? I loved it.
So enlightening.

05:09.826 --> 05:11.088
We didn't order these.

05:11.261 --> 05:12.558
These drinks
are on the house.

05:12.663 --> 05:15.530
Oh, really? Great.
Thank you very much.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.291
Funny, isn't it?

05:17.401 --> 05:20.302
You get rich and then
everything comes free.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.462
Yeah.

05:23.307 --> 05:24.740
So what brings you
to Vegas?

05:24.841 --> 05:26.331
Aldous wanted
to visit you.

05:26.443 --> 05:28.411
No. No, we were
just passing through.

05:28.645 --> 05:30.010
We were near.
Really?

05:30.580 --> 05:33.413
Actually, I've got a show
at the Greek Theatre in LA.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.775
Terrific! Terrific. Great.

05:35.886 --> 05:37.513
It's tomorrow, actually.

05:37.621 --> 05:39.213
Really? Terrific!

05:39.589 --> 05:40.851
We should go see that.

05:40.958 --> 05:43.222
Well, I'm not sure I...

05:43.327 --> 05:44.851
No, I think I'm busy tomorrow night.
I'm busy tomorrow.

05:44.962 --> 05:47.590
Don't worry about it.
It's not set in stone or...

05:47.698 --> 05:49.723
It's actually
very set in stone.

05:50.167 --> 05:52.567
No, some of us have to work for a living, right?
You know.

05:52.869 --> 05:54.803
Yeah, 'cause I remember
I became a rock star

05:54.905 --> 05:56.805
as a result of
winning a quiz show.

05:57.174 --> 05:58.539
What?

05:59.943 --> 06:01.877
All right, all right.
I'll check the schedule.

06:05.349 --> 06:06.316
Dad!

06:06.416 --> 06:07.940
I like it here.

06:08.585 --> 06:09.950
Cheers, son.

06:10.420 --> 06:12.752
Yeah, I like to come here and clear my head.

06:12.856 --> 06:14.585
You remember that first
strip club I brought you to?

06:14.691 --> 06:17.023
I do.
Fondly. Very fondly.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.618
So listen,
what are you going to open with at the Greek?

06:19.930 --> 06:21.625
<i>Love Explodes.</i>
Really?

06:21.932 --> 06:25.800
I think you should open with <i>Going Up.</i>
I love that fucking song.

06:25.902 --> 06:28.837
It's fucking genius. You know,
it's a great thing to open with.

06:28.939 --> 06:30.497
I mean, getting them up,
getting them, fuck,

06:30.607 --> 06:34.236
right there in the fucking palm of
your hand right away. <i>Going Up.</i>

06:34.344 --> 06:35.641
You missed
sound check, bitch!

06:35.746 --> 06:37.008
You know how much
that's gonna cost us?

06:37.147 --> 06:40.378
I apologize. Look,
things got out of control.

06:40.684 --> 06:43.812
But, hey, we're at The Standard now,
so it's all fine,

06:43.920 --> 06:46.616
because we're all
settled in and we're here.

06:46.723 --> 06:51.092
Guess what. I'm downstairs in the lobby.
Why don't you come on down?

06:51.695 --> 06:55.187
You know what? Actually,
Aldous just went to sleep.

06:55.532 --> 06:58.729
So I just think it'd be better if he just, like,
got some rest.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.641
April Fools.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.639
I don't want to hear
that shit. You fucked up.

07:07.978 --> 07:10.378
He doesn't do anything you want him to do!
He's a crazy person!

07:10.480 --> 07:12.607
Okay, shut the fuck up and listen.
There's a change of plans.

07:12.716 --> 07:14.343
I hope you got
a good night's sleep.

07:14.451 --> 07:17.784
We going to party these pussy
limey motherfuckers into the ground.

07:17.888 --> 07:19.355
They gonna be
dying to leave Vegas.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.990
But we gonna have
to mind fuck them.

07:22.459 --> 07:23.790
A deep mind fuck.

07:24.661 --> 07:25.628
Sergio!

07:26.430 --> 07:27.419
Aldous, hey!

07:27.531 --> 07:28.498
Have a drink with us!

07:28.598 --> 07:29.587
Come on!

07:29.699 --> 07:31.030
Whoo! Vegas!
What's up, baby?

07:31.134 --> 07:33.466
Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!

07:33.770 --> 07:34.828
Join in!

07:34.938 --> 07:37.236
Let's get our mind fuck on.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.640
Now, the Rat Pack
was the shit!

07:41.812 --> 07:44.076
Those guys right
there could croon.

07:44.514 --> 07:46.778
Whenever I would hear Frank
or Dean or Sammy sing,

07:46.883 --> 07:48.783
shit would just
warm my heart!

07:48.885 --> 07:50.944
You know, it just makes me fucking tingle!
It's nice, isn't it?

07:51.054 --> 07:52.954
Yeah, I feel that.
I feel that, Sergio.

07:53.056 --> 07:56.389
Sometimes I think that I was
Frank Sinatra in a past life,

07:56.827 --> 07:59.421
even though I was
born before he died.

07:59.529 --> 08:01.326
No, I'm Frank Sinatra.

08:01.431 --> 08:02.659
What? No.

08:02.766 --> 08:04.734
You? No.

08:04.835 --> 08:06.894
No. No, no, no.
Sorry, mate.

08:07.104 --> 08:08.935
You can't be Frank!
Can't be Frank.

08:09.172 --> 08:10.298
No.
Yeah. I'm Frank.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.068
What you trying to say?
I gotta be Sammy?

08:12.309 --> 08:13.674
Yeah.
Why I gotta be Sammy?

08:13.844 --> 08:15.368
'Cause I'm black,
I gotta be Sammy Davis?

08:15.545 --> 08:17.069
Well, you know...

08:17.180 --> 08:19.478
I look more like Frank
than I do look like Sammy!

08:19.950 --> 08:21.975
Hey, so it looks like you got
everything under control,

08:22.085 --> 08:23.575
so I might call
it an evening.

08:24.121 --> 08:25.213
Sit your ass...

08:25.322 --> 08:27.313
Has he been acting like a bitch this whole time?

08:27.424 --> 08:29.016
Yes, he has.
Yeah, he's been a right little bitch.

08:29.126 --> 08:30.957
What are you doing?
You are representing Pinnacle.

08:32.328 --> 08:35.321
Excuse me. Come here for a second.
What's your name?

08:36.666 --> 08:37.758
Destiny.

08:38.635 --> 08:40.125
Destiny, this is Aaron.

08:40.236 --> 08:43.104
He's my personal attendant.
He runs shit for me.

08:43.206 --> 08:44.901
Nice to meet you.
Aaron.

08:45.008 --> 08:46.373
Destiny.

08:47.077 --> 08:48.806
Destiny, pay attention.

08:49.146 --> 08:53.742
You are gonna go and have sex with Aaron.
Right now.

08:55.919 --> 08:57.045
That's disrespectful.

08:57.187 --> 08:59.417
Aaron,
go with your destiny.

09:00.290 --> 09:04.283
That's my name, Destiny.
And you're using it two ways.

09:09.678 --> 09:10.736
I'm actually in a band.

09:10.846 --> 09:14.577
My life is music.
I'm in an all-girl cover band

09:14.984 --> 09:18.112
and we do the
Pussycat Girl's songs.

09:18.621 --> 09:21.556
And we're called
the Pussy Kittens.

09:23.826 --> 09:25.259
Can you hook me
up with Aldous?

09:27.363 --> 09:28.330
Sure.
Cool.

09:30.299 --> 09:33.291
Okay, what are you doing?
What?

09:34.069 --> 09:35.366
Don't do that.

09:35.471 --> 09:38.668
I feel like I want to
show you something.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.839
I feel like I don't
want to see it, though.

09:43.279 --> 09:46.908
All right! Hey!
So that's your vagina.

09:47.483 --> 09:49.508
Right on.
No, but look at it!

09:49.618 --> 09:52.644
Look at the hair.
Look at the pubic hair! It's...

09:52.755 --> 09:54.620
Yeah, it's a microphone.
For my work.

09:54.723 --> 09:57.920
Hello. Testing, one, two, three!
Is this thing on?

09:58.427 --> 09:59.416
Hello?

09:59.528 --> 10:01.086
Hey, so put that away,
all right?

10:01.497 --> 10:03.692
Do you want to
sing hair-aoke?

10:04.199 --> 10:06.224
I'm okay. I'm all right.

10:06.535 --> 10:08.093
Oh, my God.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.828
I think you're really sexy

10:10.572 --> 10:12.699
because you look
like Dennis Quaid.

10:13.142 --> 10:15.736
What? Really?
Randy Quaid, maybe.

10:15.944 --> 10:17.639
Pants off!
No!

10:17.913 --> 10:18.880
Off with the pants.
Honestly...

10:18.981 --> 10:20.073
Pants-off party!

10:20.182 --> 10:22.150
You're acting crazy!
Stop. No!

10:22.551 --> 10:24.212
Hello.
All right.

10:25.788 --> 10:28.882
Fun and games are over.
Let's relax for a second.

10:29.425 --> 10:33.725
Let's just, let's just...
You carry that around with you?

10:35.130 --> 10:39.123
Stop! When's the last time
you Purell-d that thing?

10:39.234 --> 10:40.201
Kiss it.

10:42.237 --> 10:43.204
You like it.

10:43.305 --> 10:44.431
I want to go home!

10:44.540 --> 10:46.269
This is going
inside of you!

10:46.375 --> 10:48.070
No! Get off of me!
What are you doing?

10:48.177 --> 10:51.704
Oh, my God!
Why does this keep happening to me?

10:52.014 --> 10:53.709
Just relax.
No!

10:54.083 --> 10:56.051
<i>Take your medicine.</i>
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

10:56.151 --> 10:57.448
<i>Why does it</i>
<i>have balls?</i>

11:11.266 --> 11:12.699
That was really nice.

11:12.801 --> 11:14.928
No, it's really nice,
you know,

11:15.037 --> 11:16.231
playing together like that.

11:16.338 --> 11:17.396
Yeah.

11:17.506 --> 11:19.269
We should do it
more often.

11:19.775 --> 11:21.242
We should, Dad.

11:24.012 --> 11:29.575
Yeah, you know, there's a ballroom
space opening up at the Golden Nugget.

11:29.885 --> 11:31.716
I know the owner a bit,
you know?

11:32.287 --> 11:35.017
I could hook you up
with a permanent gig there.

11:36.392 --> 11:41.329
We could make loads of dough.
Well, they're all doing it, you know.

11:41.663 --> 11:43.790
Cher. Céline Dion.
Elton John.

11:43.899 --> 11:45.332
If you want money
from me, Dad, just ask.

11:46.535 --> 11:48.025
I don't want your
fucking money, do I?

11:48.337 --> 11:50.237
I just want to help your fucking career,
don't I?

11:50.339 --> 11:52.204
My career don't need help.
Really?

11:52.574 --> 11:55.168
Your last record,
you know how many it sold?

11:55.878 --> 11:58.073
Don't need help?
You sure fucking do.

11:58.380 --> 12:01.474
So you know the precise sales
figures for me last album.

12:01.917 --> 12:03.817
When was me birthday?
Surprise me. Now, look, look...

12:03.919 --> 12:05.284
When was me birthday?
Aldy, Aldy, Aldy!

12:05.387 --> 12:07.719
You never would have
made it without me.

12:07.823 --> 12:09.620
I did make it without you.
I made it in spite of you.

12:09.825 --> 12:12.623
You inherited all your musical talent from me!

12:13.695 --> 12:16.823
I wrote all your songs
from the tip of my cock.

12:17.099 --> 12:20.466
Right. That's it. So, like,
I've been plagiarizing from your ball bag.

12:20.602 --> 12:23.594
Where does the DNA come...
Where does your talent come from?

12:24.106 --> 12:25.869
Here.
Brilliant bit of biology, Dad.

12:26.241 --> 12:29.540
Yeah, I think that's what Darwin
discovered on the Galapagos Isles.

12:29.645 --> 12:32.011
That music can be written
in someone's spunk.

12:32.114 --> 12:33.706
I'm talking fucking facts.

12:33.816 --> 12:37.252
I think I've just been raped.
- What's that?

12:38.187 --> 12:39.154
Raped?

12:39.621 --> 12:41.054
Here you go, mate.
That'll take the edge off.

12:41.490 --> 12:43.549
Yeah, give him that.
Make yourself useful.

12:46.395 --> 12:48.886
Here you go. All right?
What is this?

12:49.398 --> 12:51.866
It's called a Jeffrey, Aaron.
Bit of this, bit of that.

12:52.568 --> 12:54.763
Here. Have a look.
Have a look at this.

12:55.070 --> 12:57.800
Aldous Snow wasn't always so pretty,
was he, eh?

12:58.006 --> 12:59.405
What are you showing him
that for, Dad?

12:59.508 --> 13:00.805
Why do you carry
that photograph?

13:01.443 --> 13:02.501
Remember when
we used to box?

13:03.045 --> 13:05.479
You used to get in the ring,
wheezing around.

13:06.915 --> 13:08.746
Do you remember?

13:10.252 --> 13:14.780
Hey, what's in this?
My heart's starting to beat really fast.

13:15.491 --> 13:20.053
It's weed mostly.
Sergio gave it to me.

13:20.963 --> 13:25.127
It's got a bit of opium in it.
Some heroin.

13:25.767 --> 13:27.826
Crunched-up E's.
- Clorox.

13:28.170 --> 13:31.571
Methadone. Subutex.
Morphine. Peyote.

13:32.608 --> 13:34.075
Some other stuff
that's unidentifiable,

13:34.176 --> 13:37.168
and I think a little bit of angel dust, actually,
if I'm not mistaken.

13:37.279 --> 13:39.304
You know, bit of glue for... Yeah.
Keep it traditional.

13:39.648 --> 13:40.672
It's like a drug Neapolitan.

13:42.351 --> 13:43.750
Oh, my God,
look at his little boat.

13:43.852 --> 13:45.183
What a lovely
little boat race.

13:45.287 --> 13:48.552
Yeah, let me get a shot of that.
Hold it, hold it. Cheese!

13:48.924 --> 13:50.357
I'll never tire of
looking at that git.

13:50.626 --> 13:52.491
Why the fuck is it
called a Jeffrey?

13:52.661 --> 13:54.993
'Cause who could be
scared of a Jeffrey?

13:55.130 --> 13:58.429
Yeah, Jeffrey's just this nice bloke
from down the road, isn't he?

13:59.535 --> 14:00.593
What's wrong with you?

14:00.702 --> 14:03.193
"Hello, I'm Jeffrey!
I've just moved in."

14:03.305 --> 14:04.738
"Yes, I'm Jeffrey."

14:04.840 --> 14:06.899
"Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey."
"My wife has got varicose veins!"

14:07.142 --> 14:08.336
I'm having a heart attack.

14:10.546 --> 14:11.570
I'm having a heart attack.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.977
You're not having
a heart attack, Aaron.

14:14.082 --> 14:15.549
I think he might be
having a heart attack.

14:15.651 --> 14:17.141
He's not. He's all right.
Oh, no.

14:17.252 --> 14:18.276
Don't wind him up.

14:18.387 --> 14:19.354
I'm having
a heart attack.

14:19.454 --> 14:20.887
He is.
He's having a heart attack.

14:20.989 --> 14:22.820
I'm telling you.
Listen to your dad! He's right!

14:22.925 --> 14:23.914
He's not having
a heart attack.

14:24.026 --> 14:26.790
He looks like he's having a heart attack,
doesn't he?

14:26.895 --> 14:28.362
Aaron, come with me, mate.

14:28.463 --> 14:29.828
Just get away from him.
He's an idiot.

14:29.932 --> 14:31.229
It's all right.
Just take deep breaths.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.823
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

14:32.935 --> 14:34.630
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

14:34.736 --> 14:36.135
That's what you need to do.

14:36.238 --> 14:38.138
Come here. We're together,
mate, all right?

14:38.240 --> 14:40.265
I shouldn't have given you the Jeffrey.
That was a mistake.

14:40.375 --> 14:43.538
I'm so sorry. But relax now.
It's over. Everything is beautiful.

14:43.845 --> 14:47.303
The world is beautiful. Everything is cool.
Look around us, we're...

14:47.482 --> 14:49.074
Look at that, look.
Look at these.

14:49.184 --> 14:52.449
Look at this tiny,
simple beauty of this tiny little ant.

14:52.554 --> 14:55.421
Isn't that lovely? See?
We're at one with that. So lovely.

14:55.724 --> 14:56.986
It's nice, beautiful.

14:57.092 --> 14:58.286
Isn't it beautiful?

14:58.927 --> 15:01.623
And lovely, and wonderful,
and pure and...

15:03.298 --> 15:05.266
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.992
No.
I'm on the Jeffrey, too.

15:07.102 --> 15:08.865
Now just breathe deeply.

15:09.438 --> 15:10.769
Okay.
Okay.

15:10.973 --> 15:12.531
That won't last. No.

15:12.641 --> 15:14.768
That's the joy of
the Jeffrey, you see.

15:14.876 --> 15:19.279
It goes away,
but then it comes back!

15:20.349 --> 15:21.782
Don't worry. It doesn't do that.
You're gonna be okay.

15:21.883 --> 15:22.850
Don't listen to him,
don't listen to him.

15:22.951 --> 15:24.509
Here. Put your hand here.
Just touch the furry wall.

15:24.620 --> 15:28.283
Stay with me. Be calm. Be calm.
Just stroke the furry wall.

15:28.991 --> 15:31.755
You're with the furry wall.
With the furry wall now.

15:32.194 --> 15:33.957
Dad!
Stop bullying my mate!

15:34.129 --> 15:35.892
You sound
just like your mum.

15:35.998 --> 15:38.432
Don't talk about my mum.
Y'all need to take a hit of this Jeffrey!

15:38.533 --> 15:39.591
It'll calm you down!

15:39.701 --> 15:40.690
Sammy's right!

15:40.969 --> 15:45.565
Right, I've got a question.
She still seeing that soft-dick postman, eh?

15:45.674 --> 15:46.902
Or has he left her as well?

15:47.009 --> 15:48.738
You're gonna die on
your own, old man.

15:48.844 --> 15:51.836
You're gonna die and I'm gonna fucking
laugh when you die, you old cunt.

15:51.947 --> 15:54.507
Aaron, stop stroking the furry wall!
We're going...

15:57.252 --> 15:58.310
Get off!

15:59.688 --> 16:02.122
Hey, shouldn't
somebody stop this?

16:02.524 --> 16:03.752
Feel how good this feels?

16:03.859 --> 16:06.191
I'm gonna cover the whole outside
of my house in this material.

16:06.795 --> 16:09.229
Come back here.
Get back here. Get...

16:10.332 --> 16:12.266
My house is gonna look
like a fucking werewolf.

16:12.367 --> 16:13.391
What the fuck?

16:13.502 --> 16:14.992
Go on, run away!
Stop chasing me!

16:15.103 --> 16:16.832
See, Aaron?
The plan is working.

16:17.773 --> 16:19.764
This is what old pussy used
to look like in the '70s.

16:20.542 --> 16:21.566
I miss that.

16:21.977 --> 16:23.842
You're a very bad parent!

16:24.513 --> 16:25.605
I'll show you bad, eh?

16:25.714 --> 16:26.942
What are you doing?
That's a gun!

16:27.049 --> 16:28.380
He's got a gun!

16:28.483 --> 16:30.781
Now that's what I'm talking about.
Oh, no.

16:30.886 --> 16:32.251
Where did that come from?
Hey!

16:32.387 --> 16:33.411
Keep stroking the wall!

16:33.522 --> 16:35.217
Keep stroking the wall!

16:35.457 --> 16:37.687
That's Jeffrey's gun.
No one endangers my artist!

16:39.094 --> 16:40.925
Somebody help me, please!
I'm coming, Aaron!

16:42.297 --> 16:43.924
This is so rock star.

16:44.032 --> 16:45.727
I'm having a heart attack!

16:45.834 --> 16:49.292
Somebody take me to the hospital!
It's on North Casino Way!

16:51.440 --> 16:53.305
Calm down.
I'm having a heart attack!

16:53.408 --> 16:55.899
You're having a heart attack,
are you? I am!

16:56.011 --> 16:59.037
Jesus!
Why can't everything be this simple?

16:59.614 --> 17:01.605
Sergio, fancy a drink, eh?

17:04.720 --> 17:06.517
Sergio would have made you
bring a medical kit.

17:06.621 --> 17:07.848
Where is the medical kit
that Sergio...

17:07.955 --> 17:09.856
It's over there!
It's over there!

17:12.594 --> 17:13.560
Fucker.

17:14.829 --> 17:16.593
Yeah!

17:21.403 --> 17:23.303
I'm okay.
Right!

17:23.637 --> 17:24.798
Come here!

17:24.906 --> 17:26.203
No! No. No.

17:26.308 --> 17:28.502
Now I'm gonna stab you in the
heart with this adrenaline needle.

17:28.610 --> 17:29.941
What? What?

17:35.183 --> 17:37.777
I'm alive!

17:43.492 --> 17:45.517
See if you like this.

17:48.230 --> 17:49.561
Where the hell you been?

17:49.664 --> 17:50.653
We went to see Cher.

17:50.832 --> 17:52.129
Cher? How was it?

17:52.667 --> 17:53.634
Amazing.

17:53.735 --> 17:55.703
This is all your fault!

17:55.871 --> 17:57.862
He's fucking Catwoman!

17:57.973 --> 17:59.873
You're so mean!
That's enough!

17:59.975 --> 18:01.567
It's not easy
being a parent.

18:05.914 --> 18:06.938
Shit!

18:07.048 --> 18:09.039
I'm sorry, pops,
you okay?

18:13.455 --> 18:15.582
Now, this is what the
music industry is all about.

18:15.690 --> 18:16.714
Sergio's gone crazy.

18:16.825 --> 18:18.349
I love this game!

18:18.493 --> 18:20.723
He's Jeffreyed.
Let's go! Bye!

18:20.829 --> 18:22.091
No, I don't think so.

18:22.197 --> 18:25.462
This adrenaline's crazy!
I've never run so fast in my life!

18:25.567 --> 18:27.091
I don't have my luggage!

18:27.202 --> 18:28.999
Fuck your luggage!
We'll get you new luggage!

18:29.237 --> 18:32.138
Where you going?
Run all the way back to LA!

18:32.440 --> 18:34.374
Sergio is chasing us!

18:34.543 --> 18:36.511
This is the longest
hallway of all time!

18:36.611 --> 18:38.408
It's Kubrickian!

18:40.816 --> 18:43.148
You cannot outrun me!
I am black!

18:57.499 --> 19:00.161
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Please, driver! Just drive it!

19:00.268 --> 19:03.169
Go! Now! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Drive!

19:03.839 --> 19:05.431
Drive faster!
Quickly!

19:05.540 --> 19:06.802
It's not fucking cool!

19:07.075 --> 19:08.269
Go! Oh, no!
Oh, my God! Oh!

19:10.086 --> 19:10.780
Stop, stop!
Stop!

19:13.623 --> 19:15.523
Why aren't you bitches going?
Come on!

19:15.925 --> 19:18.894
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go! Go!

19:18.995 --> 19:21.623
The plan worked!
Now that's a mind fuck.

19:25.201 --> 19:28.466
Aldous? Aldous.
Aldous, I can't sleep.

19:29.272 --> 19:31.604
The adrenaline'll wear off soon, Aaron.
Just be patient.

19:31.841 --> 19:33.832
Go back to sleep.
I can't sleep, man.

19:34.610 --> 19:37.272
This adrenaline is just...
It's like coursing through my whole body!

19:37.547 --> 19:39.071
Aaron, don't be selfish.
I'm really tired.

19:39.248 --> 19:40.772
I've had a really
difficult few days.

19:40.883 --> 19:42.748
Been under a lot of pressure.
Just let me relax.

19:43.019 --> 19:44.509
No! No!

19:44.620 --> 19:45.882
Aaron,
you're being strange.

19:46.556 --> 19:48.649
No! Aaron, don't be selfish.
I'm sleeping.

19:48.758 --> 19:51.249
No! You've kept me up for three days,
you got me all Jeffreyed up,

19:51.394 --> 19:53.123
and you stabbed me in the arm
with an adrenaline needle!

19:53.429 --> 19:54.657
You're staying up
and talking to me!

19:54.764 --> 19:56.664
I gave you that adrenaline
for your own good.

19:56.766 --> 20:00.099
Your life was in jeopardy.
I'm like a guardian angel.

20:04.540 --> 20:07.441
Your dad. Your dad, man.
That sucks.

20:09.479 --> 20:10.468
That was crazy, man.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.610
He's all right.
He's just trying to live his life, isn't he?

20:13.716 --> 20:16.378
He's not all right. He uses you.
You let people use you.

20:16.619 --> 20:18.610
Sooner or later you're
gonna be all used up!

20:18.721 --> 20:20.655
Yeah, a lot of the time
when people are on drugs,

20:20.756 --> 20:23.281
they come up with sentimental rubbish.
But this is brilliant.

20:23.860 --> 20:25.589
Ha, ha. I know you're making fun of me,
but I don't care.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.788
No, you've made me happy.
Just let me sleep now.

20:27.897 --> 20:29.091
You know what I'm gonna do
when I get home?

20:29.198 --> 20:30.165
No, this is good.

20:30.266 --> 20:31.392
I'm gonna get on
my hands and knees,

20:31.501 --> 20:33.128
and I'm gonna beg
Daphne to take me back.

20:33.603 --> 20:35.537
It's gonna be shameful.
But that's what you should do.

20:36.038 --> 20:37.835
Because Jackie
is your Daphne!

20:39.242 --> 20:41.301
I think it's a bit more
complicated than that, mate.

20:41.844 --> 20:44.608
No. Underneath that hair is a
brain and a heart just like mine.

20:45.281 --> 20:48.648
No, I think your brain
is full of lollipops

20:48.818 --> 20:52.185
and rainbows and
cheese and wonder.

20:52.688 --> 20:54.212
Mine's slightly darker.

20:54.757 --> 20:57.191
Aaron, you seem very tense.
Stop it. Aaron!

20:57.426 --> 21:00.657
You're growling. I don't like your spasm.
You're being strange.

21:02.231 --> 21:04.222
Stop it. Stop it.

21:05.568 --> 21:06.002
Sorry.

21:06.002 --> 21:06.696
Sorry.

21:16.913 --> 21:17.880
Thank you.

21:20.716 --> 21:21.683
You okay?

21:22.885 --> 21:27.219
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...
I'm just really tired.

21:27.723 --> 21:30.191
Just get some sleep, Aaron.
Go home and sleep, mate, all right?

21:30.860 --> 21:33.420
Okay, good. 'Cause if I don't get some sleep,
I think I'm gonna throw up.

21:33.529 --> 21:34.518
Go home.

21:34.630 --> 21:36.495
I'm cool.
I'm just gonna be here.

21:36.666 --> 21:38.531
I'm just gonna rest,
prepare, you know.

21:39.368 --> 21:41.233
Prepare for the show.
See you in a few hours.

21:47.877 --> 21:49.435
Good morning, beautiful.

21:49.979 --> 21:52.573
Fancy an orgasm?
'Cause I knock them out, like, for free.

21:53.950 --> 21:56.043
I told you not to come here.

21:56.485 --> 21:57.713
It just happened.

22:01.958 --> 22:03.687
Get in here, Aldous.
Don't be so violent.

22:07.463 --> 22:09.226
I gotta stop now.

22:10.499 --> 22:12.262
We're done.
All right.

22:12.368 --> 22:16.429
Hey. Steady! That's not fair.
I haven't finished.

22:16.839 --> 22:17.806
I got a busy day!

22:19.530 --> 22:22.624
What, you want to have a wank and
then just rub my tits or something?

22:22.900 --> 22:24.128
No, I don't want to.
Please?

22:24.235 --> 22:25.497
I'm not 12.
Please?

22:25.603 --> 22:26.797
I don't want to rub
your tits and wank.

22:26.904 --> 22:28.303
I'll tell you a sexy story.

22:28.405 --> 22:29.702
Jackie!
Darling.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.605
That's not fair. That's not equal.
Reason within.

22:32.710 --> 22:35.543
What about a BJ?
Just a quick one.

22:36.547 --> 22:37.844
Will you do
my balls as well?

22:38.015 --> 22:40.142
Yeah, fuck, all right.

22:40.251 --> 22:41.741
Will you put your fingers
up my bottom?

22:41.852 --> 22:45.344
All right, yeah. Later.
What are you even doing here, Aldous?

22:45.456 --> 22:46.423
Why are you in LA?

22:47.024 --> 22:49.492
I'm here because I've been thinking
about you the last few days.

22:49.860 --> 22:52.795
I want to be with you, Jackie.
I know that now.

22:56.677 --> 22:57.371
You on a Jeffrey?
Yeah.

22:57.478 --> 23:00.504
I'm not partying anymore.
I'm in a clean zone.

23:01.281 --> 23:03.215
I have been for a while.

23:03.984 --> 23:05.713
Well, that's perfect,
because...

23:05.886 --> 23:07.615
I'm actually
a different person.

23:07.721 --> 23:09.655
A very different person.

23:10.524 --> 23:14.688
I want to be clean with you.
You're the love of my life.

23:15.128 --> 23:16.527
Aldous, I've been
doing kabbalah.

23:18.499 --> 23:22.299
It's an ancient religion. It's brought to
light all the mistakes that I've made.

23:22.870 --> 23:24.428
For all those mistakes,
I am sorry.

23:24.538 --> 23:26.028
Don't be sorry.

23:27.274 --> 23:28.741
Let's get married.
I love you.

23:28.976 --> 23:30.273
Yeah, and I was
going to get married,

23:30.377 --> 23:32.140
but then you went to rehab
for methamphetamine,

23:32.246 --> 23:34.714
I was taking a lot of E,
and we had to reschedule.

23:34.948 --> 23:36.540
Come off,
'cause that's not important.

23:36.650 --> 23:39.676
Aldous!
This has been the best four months of my life.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.954
I've realized you aren't capable of happiness.

23:42.055 --> 23:43.886
It's why your
music's so shit.

23:44.625 --> 23:47.890
It's been years since I've seen
you laugh or cry in a real way.

23:47.995 --> 23:50.395
You just numb
yourself with drugs.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.559
I was clean for
seven years...

23:52.666 --> 23:54.998
And you did yoga for
five fucking hours a day!

23:55.102 --> 23:56.967
That's mental.
There's nothing in this world

23:57.070 --> 23:58.901
that you can't
turn into heroin.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.604
The other day Lars
cried for three hours.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.104
Bit indulgent.

24:04.211 --> 24:06.975
It was beautiful!
And cleansing!

24:07.080 --> 24:09.605
And more intimate than anything
you and I have ever shared.

24:09.950 --> 24:13.784
We share a son. That is a bit more
intimate than a crying drummer.

24:17.591 --> 24:20.253
Naples is not your son.
Yes, he is.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.093
Yes, he... Jackie, why...

24:23.196 --> 24:24.356
Don't say things like
that in an argument,

24:24.464 --> 24:26.295
'cause, like, you can't come back from that.
That's horrible.

24:27.668 --> 24:30.933
He's not. Do you remember
that photographer, Fernando?

24:32.205 --> 24:33.797
Do you remember when
Fernando and I went

24:33.907 --> 24:36.137
and spent that month
together in Naples?

24:37.544 --> 24:40.809
I'm so sorry, Aldous.
I was 19 at the time,

24:40.914 --> 24:43.007
and I was so
in love with you,

24:43.116 --> 24:44.811
and I thought you would
break it off with me,

24:44.918 --> 24:47.944
and then you turned out
to be such a good father.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.824
And then he just kept looking
more and more Italian.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.256
I'm so sorry.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.857
I'm so sorry.

24:57.998 --> 25:00.899
I'm so glad we finally got to
have this conversation, darling.

25:02.135 --> 25:03.329
<i>Namaste.</i>

25:04.605 --> 25:07.631
This is not an appropriate time to say <i>namaste.</i>

25:17.584 --> 25:18.551
Yeah.

25:19.219 --> 25:20.584
Naples?
Yeah?

25:21.521 --> 25:25.548
One day you'll have to
find a wife or a partner.

25:26.093 --> 25:27.082
Yeah, I know that.

25:28.328 --> 25:31.491
Don't choose a woman
like your mother.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.227
What do you mean?

25:34.801 --> 25:39.033
I mean, your mother is
a wonderful mother,

25:40.173 --> 25:43.574
but she is
a terrible human being.

25:44.945 --> 25:45.969
Are you sure of that?

25:46.480 --> 25:50.314
Well, yeah, because if she
wasn't terrible, Naples,

25:50.417 --> 25:52.408
why would she have
torn my heart up?

25:53.954 --> 25:56.354
Why are you so moody today?
I'm not moody. I'm just...

25:57.958 --> 25:59.220
I'm all right.

26:00.193 --> 26:01.160
Do you love me?

26:01.528 --> 26:02.517
I do love you, Dad.

26:04.231 --> 26:05.357
I do love you, Aldous.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.667
Why do I have to
call you Aldous?

26:08.869 --> 26:10.734
You are my dad.
Aldous.

26:10.837 --> 26:12.065
Dad.
Aldous.

26:12.172 --> 26:14.106
Dad. All right.
I'll see you later.

26:21.982 --> 26:23.006
See you tomorrow, Dad.

26:23.183 --> 26:24.207
Good boy.

26:25.686 --> 26:27.017
You gonna be okay, Aldous?

26:27.187 --> 26:28.518
Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

26:28.622 --> 26:31.420
I'll forget that the last seven
years has happened.

26:31.892 --> 26:32.859
Aldous!

26:33.994 --> 26:35.359
Hello. <i>Enter Sandman.</i>

26:35.696 --> 26:37.561
Babe? We should
really get back to Naples.

26:37.664 --> 26:38.892
He's waiting
back there for us.

26:38.999 --> 26:41.490
So why don't you go and sue Napster,
you little Danish twat?

26:45.338 --> 26:47.898
<i>Aaron!
This is Sergio! Where the fuck are you guys?</i>

26:48.008 --> 26:50.169
<i>And why the fuck aren't you</i>
<i>answering your phone?</i>

26:50.277 --> 26:53.542
<i>I'm answering my phone,</i>
<i>and I just got hit by a motherfucking car!</i>

26:53.680 --> 26:55.147
<i>Answer your...</i>

27:03.156 --> 27:06.614
Hi. Before you say anything
just let me talk, okay?

27:10.130 --> 27:11.154
You were right.

27:11.264 --> 27:14.859
We broke off our relationship
without really thinking about it.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.563
And I've learned
over the past few days

27:18.305 --> 27:23.800
that life is mainly filled with
superficial surface encounters.

27:24.311 --> 27:27.337
And I realize now how wonderful it is,
what we have.

27:28.582 --> 27:32.643
I'm begging you to take me back.
I'm sorry.

27:38.759 --> 27:40.659
Did you hook up with anyone
while you were gone?

27:44.931 --> 27:46.922
You mean
surface encounters?

27:49.703 --> 27:50.897
What is he
doing here?

27:51.071 --> 27:52.299
What the fuck
is he doing here?

27:52.939 --> 27:54.770
I'll get rid of him, all right?
Did you invite him?

27:57.110 --> 27:58.338
Hey, man.
What are you doing here?

27:59.579 --> 28:02.139
Just went and saw Jackie.

28:02.249 --> 28:03.910
She's marrying
Lars Ulrich now,

28:04.084 --> 28:05.745
and Naples ain't
really my son.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.850
I remember thinking,
"What bad advice."

28:09.689 --> 28:10.656
Thank you, Aaron.

28:11.525 --> 28:14.016
So, this is
what you live in.

28:16.363 --> 28:18.558
You're Daphne then?
Dr. Daphne?

28:18.665 --> 28:21.634
You know, when you hear about
someone and then you meet them?

28:22.269 --> 28:23.395
That's happening now.

28:24.037 --> 28:27.529
I've walked in the middle
of a romantic reconciliation?

28:28.241 --> 28:29.230
No.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.375
No, no, no.
Definitely not.

28:36.683 --> 28:37.980
Why is it so tense?

28:39.252 --> 28:43.985
Is it because he had sex with other
people when he was working with me?

28:44.090 --> 28:45.523
I think that's
something we should...

28:45.625 --> 28:47.320
We're gonna
discuss privately.

28:47.928 --> 28:49.225
No, I think I'd like
to discuss it now.

28:50.163 --> 28:54.099
Yes. I would like to talk about it.
I am upset. I am pissed.

28:55.268 --> 28:56.792
Why are you
so cross, Daphne?

28:57.604 --> 28:59.731
Because he broke my trust.

29:00.373 --> 29:01.965
We were barely
broken up for a day

29:02.142 --> 29:03.734
and he went and
cheated on me.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.742
I didn't enjoy it, okay?

29:07.914 --> 29:11.372
What I think, Daph,
is that human beings

29:11.484 --> 29:14.510
by their nature
are polygamous.

29:14.921 --> 29:18.482
It's against nature to be with one person.
It never works.

29:19.259 --> 29:20.556
Yeah.
Or you think it's working,

29:20.660 --> 29:21.922
and then it turns out
he's cheating on you

29:22.028 --> 29:23.518
with a bunch of
hos and skanks.

29:30.670 --> 29:36.575
I personally think that monogamy can
work given the right circumstance.

29:36.676 --> 29:40.635
Aaron, why have you chosen to put
yourself in this ideological prison?

29:41.114 --> 29:43.674
You don't need these
unnecessary restrictions.

29:44.317 --> 29:46.877
Unless you get rid of them,
you just can't progress.

29:47.254 --> 29:49.154
What kind of
sexual restrictions?

29:49.256 --> 29:50.780
'Cause in nature,
there's everything

29:50.891 --> 29:53.086
from polygamy to,
like, a threesome.

29:53.193 --> 29:54.558
What...
Threesome.

29:54.661 --> 29:56.788
Well, I mean, a threesome is
something that's possible right now.

29:56.897 --> 29:58.990
You know,
the three of us could have a threesome.

29:59.532 --> 30:02.000
Hypothetically.
We've got the utensils.

30:03.670 --> 30:04.898
There's three of us.

30:10.210 --> 30:12.542
Okay, that's funny.

30:15.081 --> 30:17.072
Yeah, we're gonna
do a threesome.

30:18.151 --> 30:19.948
Let's just get naked
and start fucking right here.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.159
We should do it.
We should have a threesome.

30:28.461 --> 30:29.428
Wait, what?

30:32.832 --> 30:34.732
I don't... What?

30:34.834 --> 30:37.394
Come on.
Let's have a threesome.

30:38.238 --> 30:41.139
No, thanks. I don't...
I'm all right, thank you.

30:41.675 --> 30:42.937
So you get to mess
around on the road,

30:43.043 --> 30:44.670
and because I'm a woman,
I don't get to have any fun?

30:45.812 --> 30:47.370
You had your turn.
It's my turn now.

30:47.547 --> 30:49.139
I would like to have
a threesome, please.

30:49.549 --> 30:50.777
Don't think of it
as a threesome.

30:50.884 --> 30:53.079
Think of it as having
sex with your girlfriend

30:53.186 --> 30:55.780
while someone else also
has sex with your girlfriend.

30:56.256 --> 30:57.951
I think it'd be fun.
We should do a threesome.

30:58.458 --> 31:00.085
What are you doing?

31:00.260 --> 31:01.887
We are pre-negotiating
a threesome.

31:03.096 --> 31:05.758
Pre-negotiated.
And agreed upon.

31:05.899 --> 31:06.866
I'm fucking psyched!

31:10.804 --> 31:17.004
So, Aaron, Daphne,
shall we play doctor?

31:20.680 --> 31:23.171
I'm not sucking his dick,
that's like 100%.

31:27.587 --> 31:30.852
Just relax.
Just relax and listen to Mariah.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.527
That's good.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.254
Aaron, look at her.

31:41.701 --> 31:43.464
Aaron, look at Daphne.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.060
Put those strawberries down.
They're not for you.

31:45.939 --> 31:49.102
Come on, mate, don't be tight.
We share everything now.

31:58.618 --> 32:00.745
Okay, I'm gonna kiss
Aldous now, okay?

32:00.854 --> 32:01.912
Yeah. Yeah.
Is that okay?

32:02.022 --> 32:03.956
Yeah, it's totally cool.
Okay. Great.

32:18.972 --> 32:20.405
Oh, my God!

32:24.010 --> 32:25.671
Oh, fuck!

32:27.580 --> 32:29.377
Oh, my God!

32:33.386 --> 32:34.717
Daphne?
Yeah?

32:35.088 --> 32:36.453
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

32:36.556 --> 32:38.717
You sure you want to do this?
Fuck!

32:40.894 --> 32:42.486
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

32:42.595 --> 32:45.291
Aaron, no.
What?

32:45.532 --> 32:46.863
What are you doing?
I'm just having a threesome!

32:46.966 --> 32:48.160
I'm just having fun!
Come on!

32:48.268 --> 32:50.828
Enough with these rules and restrictions, right?
Come on!

32:51.738 --> 32:53.865
Unleash that!
This is the emperor! Release him!

32:54.207 --> 32:55.435
Aaron, don't do that!

32:57.343 --> 32:58.367
You need to
look at yourselves.

32:58.478 --> 32:59.968
Honestly, this isn't
how people live.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.481
What the fuck
are we doing?

33:05.652 --> 33:06.983
I don't know.

33:07.087 --> 33:08.918
What are we doing?
I don't want to do this.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.620
I don't want this, either.
Like, at all.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.483
I am so sorry, Aaron.

33:14.194 --> 33:15.161
How did this happen?

33:16.362 --> 33:18.830
You kind of insisted,
but whatever.

33:19.566 --> 33:22.262
Wow. That was insane.
What was I thinking?

33:22.368 --> 33:26.304
I think I've misjudged the dynamic.
You've been wonderful hosts.

33:26.673 --> 33:27.640
Particularly you.

33:30.043 --> 33:32.443
Oh, God, I'm on call.
Jesus Christ.

33:34.714 --> 33:39.242
Nothing you say makes any sense!
Okay? I understand that now.

33:39.352 --> 33:40.944
You're just
a fucking junkie.

33:41.054 --> 33:43.249
And you're smart,
so you make your insanity sound good,

33:43.356 --> 33:44.414
but it's bullshit.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.450
This is it, Aaron.
This is rock and roll.

33:49.729 --> 33:50.855
Did you enjoy the party?

33:51.431 --> 33:53.922
You're sick in
the fucking head!

33:54.033 --> 33:56.968
You messed your own life up and
now you have to mess up mine, too?

33:58.571 --> 33:59.833
We're done here?

34:00.006 --> 34:01.303
Get out of my apartment.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.369
Thanks for the hospitality.

34:11.684 --> 34:12.650
Bye.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.150
Where are my boxers?

34:27.065 --> 34:29.295
So I might not
do the Greek.

34:29.536 --> 34:31.436
You know, the show at the Greek.
The concert.

34:31.538 --> 34:32.902
<i>I might not do it.</i>

34:33.005 --> 34:34.303
Oh, dear.

34:35.641 --> 34:36.609
That's a shame.

34:36.976 --> 34:38.739
Can you say something
reassuring to me?

34:38.844 --> 34:42.178
Say that reassuring thing
that mums say to their son?

34:42.649 --> 34:44.275
<i>You... No, you...</i>

34:44.617 --> 34:49.884
You stay chipper.
And don't get down.

34:51.391 --> 34:56.021
And when you get back,
I'll make you some shortbread or...

34:57.630 --> 35:00.622
All right, well,
I think everything's gonna be all right.

35:00.733 --> 35:04.362
Anyway, I just wanted you to
know that I love you, Mum.

35:04.470 --> 35:08.304
<i>Stay chipper.</i>
<i>All right, darling? Bye-bye.</i>

35:16.316 --> 35:17.340
<i>Coming up later...</i>

35:17.450 --> 35:20.851
<i>The 10-year anniversary of Aldous</i>
<i>Snow's seminal concert at the Greek.</i>

35:22.322 --> 35:27.783
<i>Live in Los Angeles. But now,</i>
Bill Maher, Red, White and Spew.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.093
<i>"Where the fuc</i> k <i>are you?
I am gonna kill you</i>. <i>Smiley face."</i>

35:33.132 --> 35:34.099
Fuck him.

35:35.468 --> 35:36.799
<i>Broadcasting</i>
<i>live from the Greek,</i>

35:36.903 --> 35:38.200
<i>your Uncle Joe.</i>
<i>The crowd is amped!</i>

35:38.304 --> 35:41.137
<i>Aldous Snow,</i>
<i>the most self-destructive man in rock and roll,</i>

35:41.241 --> 35:42.708
<i>not yet in the building.</i>

35:42.809 --> 35:45.209
<i>Well, there'll be</i>
<i>a lot of Infant Sorrow...</i>

35:45.311 --> 35:46.710
<i>Aaron? It's me.</i>

35:46.813 --> 35:48.804
<i>I really need to</i>
<i>apologize and to tell you</i>

35:48.915 --> 35:52.476
<i>that I'm gonna jump off the roof</i>
<i>of the Standard Hotel now.</i>

35:52.585 --> 35:53.552
Fuck him.

35:54.854 --> 35:56.253
<i>If you're not busy...</i>

36:00.627 --> 36:02.492
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.398
Hello, Los Angeles!

36:16.976 --> 36:19.001
Should I jump
into the pool?

36:20.513 --> 36:22.413
Or how about
into the street?

36:38.698 --> 36:43.362
Hey, Aldous, it's Aaron! Get down!
I'm here! I'm here, get down from there!

36:44.971 --> 36:48.634
Hey, Aldous, I'm here! Hey!
Hey, Aldous, don't jump!

36:49.542 --> 36:50.531
Hi, Aaron!

36:50.643 --> 36:53.441
Just come down and
we'll talk about it!

36:53.546 --> 36:55.138
You made it!
No, stop!

36:55.248 --> 36:57.546
- He's gonna jump!
- Don't do it! No, stop!

37:01.621 --> 37:04.112
No, no, no! No, no, no!

37:08.594 --> 37:09.754
Aldous! Aldous!

37:09.929 --> 37:11.089
My arm.

37:11.764 --> 37:12.731
Aaron.

37:14.434 --> 37:16.061
Are you okay, man?
You...

37:16.169 --> 37:19.696
Aaron, it was
wrong of me to have sex

37:19.806 --> 37:21.296
with you and
your girlfriend, Daphne.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.170
That wasn't fair.
No, no, that's okay.

37:23.276 --> 37:24.868
We don't have to talk about it.
I done it for me.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.205
I done it for my
selfish reasons.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.337
I know, but fine.
Whatever. Just...

37:28.514 --> 37:30.539
I don't wanna...
Are you okay?

37:33.353 --> 37:37.153
I'm Ionely, mate.
I'm really Ionely.

37:39.125 --> 37:43.289
And I'm sad. And I ain't got no one,
except my mum.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.324
And she's an idiot.

37:46.366 --> 37:47.594
And now I'm crying
in front of you,

37:47.700 --> 37:49.031
and you thought
I was cool, didn't you,

37:49.135 --> 37:51.933
for a while, and now I'm crying.
I'm embarrassed.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.239
Embarrassed.

37:59.312 --> 38:01.075
You try so hard, man.

38:03.182 --> 38:04.615
But you're fine.

38:09.155 --> 38:10.645
You're Aldous Snow, man.

38:13.559 --> 38:17.325
You make people happy
by doing what you love to do.

38:18.431 --> 38:20.490
And that's fucking awesome.

38:21.234 --> 38:23.065
There's thousands of
people in a room right now

38:23.169 --> 38:25.763
just standing,
waiting to see your face.

38:27.907 --> 38:31.502
And they like you.
I liked you before I met you.

38:34.180 --> 38:35.545
Don't you like me no more?

38:36.115 --> 38:38.879
Aldous, I came here.

38:40.286 --> 38:41.253
I'm here.

38:43.309 --> 38:47.075
Right. I want to do the gig.
I'm gonna... I'll do the gig.

38:47.413 --> 38:48.437
I'm gonna do it.
No, I didn't mean that.

38:48.548 --> 38:49.537
I don't think that we...
Let's go.

38:49.649 --> 38:51.241
We shouldn't go.
No, we should do it.

38:51.351 --> 38:52.545
I don't want to let people down who love me.

38:52.652 --> 38:54.176
Not tonight.
Let's go. Let's do it.

38:54.654 --> 38:56.781
I'm pretty sure if you don't go to a hospital,
you're going to die.

38:56.889 --> 39:00.791
I want to go to the Greek Theatre
and I want to save your job,

39:00.893 --> 39:02.656
and I want to
perform for my fans

39:02.762 --> 39:04.195
and do something
that ain't selfish,

39:04.297 --> 39:10.327
'cause this is not working
for me as a lifestyle choice.

39:12.638 --> 39:13.627
You sure you're okay?

39:13.740 --> 39:16.334
'Cause it looks like Jaws just bit your ass off.

39:17.543 --> 39:21.104
Yeah. Little bit of blood
makes a really big cloud.

39:24.183 --> 39:26.344
This is a bad idea.
We should not be doing this.

39:26.819 --> 39:29.310
Yes, we should.
This is a good idea.

39:29.756 --> 39:31.417
Although, my arm is
hurting a little bit.

39:32.925 --> 39:35.086
I sustained an injury.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39:35.194 --> 39:36.821
That's bone.
I'm taking you to the hospital, Aldous.

39:36.929 --> 39:38.157
I'm taking you to the hospital,
all right, man?

39:38.264 --> 39:41.097
Not tonight. This is
rock and roll. Touch it.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.599
That is so fucking...

39:42.702 --> 39:44.465
Don't overreact.

39:46.539 --> 39:47.631
I fucking threw up.

39:47.740 --> 39:48.798
I told you
don't freak out.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.376
Get that fucking arm out of my face!
I fucking threw up!

40:03.756 --> 40:06.589
Yes, yes, yes!
I knew you would make it. I love you!

40:06.726 --> 40:07.784
Sergio.
Shit!

40:07.894 --> 40:09.623
No! We should take him
to the hospital.

40:09.729 --> 40:11.321
No. Come on,
let's get him into wardrobe.

40:11.431 --> 40:13.422
Don't worry about it.
Let's get him out to the audience there.

40:13.533 --> 40:14.795
The audience is
getting restless,

40:14.901 --> 40:15.959
but you're here.
You are here.

40:16.402 --> 40:17.801
Hey, look, we should talk.

40:18.871 --> 40:22.466
What's up?
He's like, really, really hurt.

40:23.075 --> 40:25.202
What are you talking about?
He's here.

40:25.311 --> 40:26.801
He's all right.
It's just a little scratch.

40:27.046 --> 40:28.411
There's a teeny-weeny
bone sticking out!

40:28.514 --> 40:29.742
He can't go on.

40:29.849 --> 40:33.182
What the fuck? Hold on.
We have something for that.

40:33.753 --> 40:37.154
Give him two of these.
He'll be singing like Aretha Franklin.

40:38.157 --> 40:39.920
I can't do this anymore.

40:40.026 --> 40:42.392
What the fuck you talking about,
you can't do it anymore?

40:42.495 --> 40:44.463
You, you got him here!
You've done it!

40:44.564 --> 40:46.532
He doesn't need to be pushed
on the stage right now. I...

40:46.632 --> 40:49.396
Sometimes we gotta
sacrifice one lamb, baby.

40:49.502 --> 40:51.265
It's gonna be all right.
He's not gonna die!

40:51.370 --> 40:53.270
You keep feeding
him drugs and lies.

40:53.439 --> 40:55.339
He's a sad guy.
He needs help.

40:55.441 --> 40:57.841
He's gonna live a long time.
Trust me.

40:57.944 --> 40:59.536
British motherfuckers
don't die.

40:59.645 --> 41:02.045
You ever heard of a fucking...
A British rock and roll star dying?

41:02.148 --> 41:05.379
No, none of them die.
Mick Jagger. Keith Richards.

41:05.518 --> 41:09.079
Those Led Zeppelin...
Them motherfuckers old as fuck!

41:09.188 --> 41:11.679
Fucking Ozzy Osbourne's
gonna outlive Miley Cyrus!

41:11.791 --> 41:12.758
I quit.

41:12.859 --> 41:15.157
Hey, come on!
Why do you even have me feeling like this?

41:15.261 --> 41:17.388
This is supposed
to be fun!

41:17.497 --> 41:18.828
I fucking quit.

41:18.931 --> 41:20.262
Aaron, get back here!

41:27.116 --> 41:29.846
Aldous! You don't
have to go out there.

41:29.952 --> 41:31.579
You don't have to
do this anymore!

41:32.021 --> 41:34.956
I don't know what all the fuss was about.
I love doing this!

41:36.659 --> 41:37.683
You don't have to do this.

41:37.860 --> 41:38.884
I do, Aaron.

41:39.095 --> 41:40.687
They're all here to see me.

41:42.031 --> 41:43.328
I feel nervous.

41:45.601 --> 41:47.330
It's good to
feel something.

41:48.337 --> 41:52.273
I love this!
It's all I've got. And you.

41:54.210 --> 41:57.509
I owe you one, mate.
See you on the other side.

42:28.978 --> 42:31.310
<i>Like water through a drain</i>

42:31.414 --> 42:34.406
<i>I'm spinning down, down, down</i>
- <i>Down, down, down</i>

42:35.218 --> 42:37.311
<i>Like the needle in my vein</i>

42:37.420 --> 42:40.480
<i>You're bringing me down, down,</i>
<i>down Down, down, down</i>

42:41.290 --> 42:43.485
<i>Like a dog who's gone insane</i>

42:43.593 --> 42:46.790
<i>You're putting me down, down,</i>
<i>down Down, down, down</i>

42:47.563 --> 42:50.191
<i>And those of you</i>
<i>who doubted me</i>

42:50.299 --> 42:52.597
<i>You're going down, down, down</i>
<i>Down, down, down</i>

42:53.569 --> 42:56.629
<i>And the record man</i>
<i>who never called</i>

42:56.739 --> 43:00.505
<i>Can you hear what's going on?</i>

43:00.743 --> 43:06.545
<i>I'm coming up</i>

43:06.649 --> 43:12.610
<i>I'm coming up</i>

43:12.722 --> 43:17.955
<i>I'm coming up</i>

43:18.594 --> 43:24.794
<i>I'm coming up</i>

43:26.669 --> 43:31.106
<i>And this world ain't gonna</i>
<i>Catch me going down</i>

43:54.730 --> 43:57.927
<i>Another night</i>
<i>you're on my mind</i>

43:58.034 --> 44:02.266
<i>I'm hypnotized but I</i>
<i>cannot find the signs</i>

44:03.639 --> 44:07.769
<i>The signs for the Tube to come</i>
<i>home I need the Tube to get home</i>

44:07.877 --> 44:10.937
<i>Another night I'm here alone</i>

44:11.047 --> 44:15.507
<i>My eyes so tired from</i>
<i>staring at this phone</i>

44:17.119 --> 44:20.919
<i>Why won't you call and come home?</i>
<i>Please, call and come home</i>

44:21.023 --> 44:25.153
<i>And I know that you won't</i>
<i>come Just for the cash</i>

44:26.429 --> 44:31.799
<i>But will you come for my</i>
<i>bangers My beans and mash?</i>

44:37.473 --> 44:40.442
<i>Another night in Soho Grand</i>

44:40.543 --> 44:45.173
<i>My wrists so tired</i>
<i>From working with my hands</i>

44:46.716 --> 44:50.550
<i>Why has the world gone so still?</i>
<i>The world is so still</i>

44:50.653 --> 44:55.215
<i>I feel that my next meal</i>
<i>might be my last</i>

44:56.158 --> 45:01.357
<i>Will you come for my bangers</i>
<i>My beans and mash?</i>

45:03.165 --> 45:07.499
<i>Come for my bangers</i>
<i>My beans and mash</i>

45:12.508 --> 45:13.566
Aaron? Listen...

45:13.676 --> 45:14.802
Don't say anything.

45:19.348 --> 45:23.250
<i>The signs for the Tube to come</i>
<i>home I need the Tube to get home</i>

45:23.386 --> 45:26.378
<i>Another night I'm here alone</i>

45:26.489 --> 45:30.823
<i>These eyes so tired</i>
<i>From staring at your phone</i>

45:32.661 --> 45:36.427
<i>Why won't you call and come home?</i>
<i>Please, call and come home</i>

45:37.099 --> 45:41.092
<i>I know that you won't come</i>
<i>Just for the cash</i>

45:42.171 --> 45:48.508
<i>Will you come for my bangers</i>

45:48.778 --> 45:55.650
<i>Oh, come for my bangers</i>
<i>My beans and mash</i>

46:14.003 --> 46:17.564
Oh, my God.
We slept for, like, 14 hours.

46:19.408 --> 46:22.639
Wow. I feel
so much better now.

46:22.912 --> 46:24.277
Me, too.

46:25.815 --> 46:27.009
Do you want to
get some brunch?

46:36.625 --> 46:38.354
We should probably burn
these sheets, huh?

46:38.461 --> 46:41.259
Yeah. I can get some bleach
from the hospital.

46:41.363 --> 46:44.093
Maybe just torch the whole apartment.
You got it?

46:44.200 --> 46:45.258
Yeah.

46:47.937 --> 46:48.926
<i>All right.</i>

46:50.873 --> 46:53.569
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>You sound sarcastic now. Cheers, cheers.</i>

46:53.909 --> 46:56.070
<i>Welcome back to</i> Storytellers.

46:56.512 --> 46:59.948
<i>Yeah, I've been sober</i>
<i>now for six months.</i>

47:00.182 --> 47:01.342
<i>So that's positive.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

47:03.252 --> 47:04.310
<i>Thanks.</i>

47:06.422 --> 47:09.255
<i>It's lovely to be applauded</i>
<i>for being in recovery</i>

47:09.358 --> 47:11.292

47:11.393 --> 47:14.294
<i>I can see some of you are literally on drugs now,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

47:14.797 --> 47:20.394
<i>Here with us in the audience is</i>
<i>my dear friend and collaborator,</i>

47:20.503 --> 47:22.266
<i>Aaron Green.</i>
<i>Stand up, Aaron!</i>

47:23.339 --> 47:24.306
<i>Yes.</i>

47:26.375 --> 47:27.637

How are you?

47:54.290 --> 47:57.487
<i>He was my son for a while,</i>
<i>but due to my complicated sex life,</i>

47:57.594 --> 48:00.859
<i>it turns out it's best just to think</i>

48:01.264 --> 48:05.098
<i>Also, also he's quite mature.</i>
<i>He's more mature than me.</i>
