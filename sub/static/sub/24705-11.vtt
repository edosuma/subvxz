00:28.959 --> 00:33.521
Detective Sipowicz, please tell the court
how you came to arrest Mr. Giardella.

00:33.597 --> 00:36.088
This past August 27 th,

00:36.166 --> 00:40.262
I was routinely surveilling the
defendant because he's a known felon.

00:40.337 --> 00:44.239
During the course of the surveillance,
I observed the defendant's vehicle...

00:44.308 --> 00:48.301
have a flat tire, and he got out of
the Cadillac and he opened the trunk.

00:48.379 --> 00:52.440
At that time I approached the vehicle,
identified myself as a police officer,

00:52.516 --> 00:55.883
and in the course of casual observation
of the open trunk,

00:55.953 --> 01:00.913
I saw 27 cartons of filter cigarettes
which did not have tax stamps.

01:00.991 --> 01:04.927
I ascertained that the vehicle
was owned by the defendant.

01:04.995 --> 01:07.293
I gave him his rights
and took him into custody.

01:07.364 --> 01:09.730
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.734
Detective Sipowicz,

01:14.605 --> 01:18.006
you've testified that the cartons
of untaxed cigarettes,

01:18.075 --> 01:21.306
for possession of which you arrested
Mr. Giardella, were in plain sight...

01:21.378 --> 01:25.075
in Mr. Giardella's trunk when he opened
it to get out a jack to fix the flat.

01:25.149 --> 01:29.586
- Right.
- Now, there were seven nails...

01:29.653 --> 01:32.816
in Mr. Giardella's
right rear radial, Detective.

01:32.890 --> 01:36.087
That wouldn't exactly
produce a slow leak.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.596
Yet you say that during several hours
of antecedent surveillance...

01:39.663 --> 01:43.690
you saw no one damage
Mr. Giardella's tire.

01:43.767 --> 01:47.703
I was surveilling Mr. Giardella,
not his car, Counselor.

01:47.771 --> 01:50.103
He stopped at
Niglio's Coffee House.

01:50.174 --> 01:52.267
Maybe, uh...
Maybe some urban youths...

01:52.343 --> 01:56.109
- did mischief to his vehicle
during that time frame.

01:56.180 --> 02:00.116
Your Honor, uh, justified or not,

02:00.184 --> 02:04.245
the reputation of the neighborhood in
which Niglio's Coffee House is located...

02:04.321 --> 02:06.687
is such that urban youths"...

02:06.757 --> 02:10.658
do not tend to congregate
and do mischief in its environs.

02:10.728 --> 02:13.993
Maybe he drove past a construction site
after he left the place.

02:14.064 --> 02:18.160
Detective Sipowicz is known to have a
personal vendetta against Mr. Giardella.

02:18.235 --> 02:22.865
I submit that the true scenario is that
while my client stopped at Niglio's,

02:22.940 --> 02:27.206
Detective Sipowicz hammered nails
into his tire and caused a flat,

02:27.277 --> 02:31.338
so that when Mr. Giardella
stopped to get out a spare,

02:31.415 --> 02:34.748
the detective could circumvent
probable cause statutes...

02:34.818 --> 02:39.050
and go fishing inside
Mr. Giardella's trunk.

02:39.123 --> 02:43.753
Move to suppress the evidence as tainted
and dismiss the complaint.

02:43.827 --> 02:45.761
Granted.

02:45.829 --> 02:48.662
- What about the construction-site
theory? - Pathetic.

02:48.732 --> 02:50.927
Adjourned.

02:51.001 --> 02:53.333
Hey, what is that,
a dead rat you got on your head?

02:53.404 --> 02:55.497
Now make some bad-wig jokes.

02:55.572 --> 02:58.234
Meanwhile, I'm walking out the door,
you nickel stiff.

02:58.308 --> 03:02.472
Sipowicz, what is it you clear, about 90 a
day? Here, go buy yourself some clean socks.

03:02.546 --> 03:06.277
I'm gonna burn you down, you
small-time operator. You count on it.

03:06.350 --> 03:09.217
- Let's lay off him. - No shot. That
wig-wearing hump rubs me the wrong way.

03:09.286 --> 03:11.379
I'm gonna make his life miserable.

03:11.455 --> 03:14.083
- And bury your own career in the bargain.
- Who are you kiddin', John?

03:14.158 --> 03:17.389
- They already held that service.
- Andy...

03:17.461 --> 03:21.921
Hey, Miss District Attorney. You really
prosecuted the crap outta that one.

03:21.999 --> 03:24.194
I went with the crap I had,
Detective.

03:24.268 --> 03:28.034
Oh, you think that was a hummer bust?
You sayin' I queered that guy's tire?

03:28.105 --> 03:32.906
I'd say res ipsa locuitor
if I thought you knew what it meant.

03:32.976 --> 03:37.106
Hey! Ipsa this,
you pissy little bitch!

05:04.466 --> 05:06.559
- Hey, guys.
- How's it going?

05:06.635 --> 05:08.569
How you doin', Detective?

05:09.638 --> 05:12.232
- Morning.
- Good morning.

05:14.776 --> 05:16.710
Detective Kelly.

05:16.778 --> 05:19.303
Hey, Sarge. Thank you.

05:21.149 --> 05:23.083
Where's Sipowicz?

05:23.151 --> 05:26.643
Hey, Lieutenant.
He's, uh, runnin' an errand.

05:26.722 --> 05:28.986
My office.

05:29.057 --> 05:33.756
I heard he flipped out in court.
You need to think about a new partner.

05:36.098 --> 05:39.033
Lieutenant, I know Sipowicz
is messin' up,

05:39.101 --> 05:41.433
but he's gonna come out of it.

05:47.743 --> 05:49.836
I realize how you feel about him, John.

05:49.912 --> 05:52.904
Both of us know where Andy is right now,

05:52.981 --> 05:55.074
and it's not runnin' an errand.

05:55.150 --> 05:57.983
He's on a bar stool at Patrick's
gettin' loaded.

05:58.053 --> 06:02.649
Andy was a great cop. Now he's a drunk
that won't help himself.

06:02.724 --> 06:05.124
I'm taking him off the street.

06:05.193 --> 06:08.959
Lieutenant, don't do that yet. Let me talk
to him. Let me see if I can shake him up.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.367
That asshole Giardella.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.962
He can wear all the thousand-dollar
suits he wants. I'm not impressed.

06:38.038 --> 06:43.738
I popped him when he was rollin' drunks
in the park, and he knows I did.

06:43.811 --> 06:47.110
You know where that wig-wearin'
scumbag hump's gonna be tonight?

06:47.181 --> 06:50.082
- The best table at Gianinni's.
- Gianinni's. You're damn right,

06:50.150 --> 06:53.813
tellin' some broad how his lawyer
made me look like a jerk.

06:53.887 --> 06:55.821
Mm.

06:55.889 --> 06:59.017
Ahh.
Leon, hurt me twice.

07:02.930 --> 07:06.798
- This is gotta stop, Andy.
- What's gotta stop?

07:06.867 --> 07:09.335
This. You're gettin' stiff
every afternoon now.

07:09.403 --> 07:11.337
Hey, look.
I don't recall...

07:11.405 --> 07:13.896
requesting any career-counselling
session from you.

07:13.974 --> 07:15.965
When was the last time
you tried goin' on the wagon?

07:16.043 --> 07:18.238
When was the last time
you tried growin' tits?

07:22.082 --> 07:24.642
All right.
Maybe we better talk in the morning.

07:24.718 --> 07:28.279
- No, no, no. Let's talk now.
- Okay.

07:30.424 --> 07:32.585
- I think we should call it quits.
- Meaning what?

07:32.659 --> 07:35.594
Meaning us being partners.

07:35.662 --> 07:37.926
Huh! Yeah, sure.

07:37.998 --> 07:40.330
Get a little bored at home,
you dump your wife.

07:40.401 --> 07:42.995
Got a few problems at work,
you dump your partner.

07:43.070 --> 07:47.564
First of all, I didn't dump her, she dumped
me, and second of all, I've been carryin' you.

07:47.641 --> 07:52.738
I know it, you know it,
every cop in the station house knows it,

07:52.813 --> 07:54.906
and I'm sick of it.

07:57.718 --> 08:01.711
All right. You wanna split up? That's
no problem. That's no problem at all.

08:03.724 --> 08:06.454
- Get your hands off me. Get your hands off of me!
- Let's go...

08:06.527 --> 08:08.791
- Let's go somewhere and get somethin' to eat.
- I can't.

08:08.862 --> 08:11.922
I'm on rug patrol tonight.
It might embarrass your career.

08:11.999 --> 08:15.025
- Andy, come here.
- Get away. Just get away from me, Kelly,

08:15.102 --> 08:17.696
or so help me,
I'll clean your clock.

08:28.482 --> 08:32.179
- Let me, uh, take care of this.
- Sure.

08:53.307 --> 08:55.707
- Hey, Ramon.
- Hey, hiya, Detective.

08:55.776 --> 08:58.939
- She just went in.
- Where'd you get that shiner?

08:59.012 --> 09:01.913
Oh, punks. They jumped me
in the basement on Tuesday.

09:01.982 --> 09:06.112
- Anybody report it?
- What am I gonna report?

09:06.186 --> 09:08.416
I just gave 'em the $46.

09:08.489 --> 09:11.515
Ramon, you don't report it,
I can't do anything about it.

09:12.893 --> 09:16.056
I'll send a sector car over.

09:16.130 --> 09:19.065
You should move back into the building
is what you should do.

09:35.782 --> 09:37.716
Hey.

09:37.784 --> 09:39.979
I brought dinner.

09:40.053 --> 09:42.681
Where's the separation forms,
Johnny?

09:43.857 --> 09:46.519
You know what? I lost 'em.

09:46.593 --> 09:49.255
- You lost them?
- I looked all over the station.

09:49.329 --> 09:53.629
- We'll both work off yours.
- We're each supposed to fill out assets and expenses, you jerk.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.464
I lost the form, Laurie.
You want me to hang myself?

09:59.039 --> 10:01.507
So am I dismissed?

10:01.575 --> 10:03.509
Do I get pizza?

10:17.558 --> 10:20.220
Ramon got mugged
in the laundry room?

10:20.294 --> 10:23.855
- Last Tuesday.
- When was I gonna hear about it?

10:23.931 --> 10:27.662
I just found out about it yesterday, John.
He was embarrassed to let anyone know.

10:27.734 --> 10:29.861
Don't go down there nighttime anymore,
all right?

10:29.937 --> 10:32.235
I've been going to the Laundromat.

10:32.306 --> 10:34.774
How's work?
You gonna let 'em put up that building?

10:34.841 --> 10:38.174
We're still negotiating the variance.

10:38.245 --> 10:40.770
Thank you.

10:40.847 --> 10:43.441
How's your work, John?

10:43.517 --> 10:45.610
I'd ask if I wanted to know.

10:45.686 --> 10:49.053
You know... we are splittin' up.

10:49.122 --> 10:52.683
You do not have to hate
the job anymore, okay?

10:52.759 --> 10:55.728
Just 'cause we're splitting doesn't mean
I'm going to stop worrying about you...

10:55.796 --> 10:58.594
or caring what happens to you.

10:58.665 --> 11:00.599
Good.

11:04.471 --> 11:06.405
Hey, come here.

11:08.508 --> 11:11.238
- You sure we're doing the right thing?
- I'm sure.

11:11.311 --> 11:16.578
Hmm? Because a lot of people stay together
behind less than what we got goin', Laurie.

11:16.650 --> 11:18.584
That's not good enough.

11:18.652 --> 11:21.746
Look, I don't want to have this
conversation every time you get horny.

11:21.822 --> 11:24.086
It's not going to work out for us.

11:24.157 --> 11:26.887
My mistake.

11:26.960 --> 11:31.329
- I think it would be easier on us if we made a clean break.
- Okay.

11:31.398 --> 11:34.765
I mean, I still have feelings for you,
and I know you still have feelings for me.

11:34.835 --> 11:38.828
- That's right.
- So I think it would be easier if we just left each other alone.

11:52.819 --> 11:55.083
A lot of good this is going to do.

12:24.685 --> 12:27.381
Anything you want, Sal.

12:31.358 --> 12:33.451
You're such an easy guy to find,
Alfonse.

12:33.527 --> 12:36.621
Thursday's at Gianinni's.
You're such a creature of habit.

12:36.697 --> 12:39.996
- What are you doing here, Sipowicz?
- Am I interrupting, huh?

12:40.067 --> 12:43.298
Was Al here impressing you on how strong
he is with the Marino family?

12:43.370 --> 12:46.635
Hey, I'm with a lady. You're crossin'
a line here. Move away from me.

12:46.707 --> 12:50.074
What is that, a threat, huh?
That supposed to intimidate me?

12:50.143 --> 12:53.476
Look around you, Sipowicz. You can't
afford anything in here. Go home.

12:53.547 --> 12:55.481
- Stand up.
- Are you crazy?

12:55.549 --> 12:58.347
- Shut up! Stand up! Just shut your mouth!
- Are you nuts?

12:58.418 --> 13:01.751
All right. Mr. Wig says,
Alfonse has to go outside now."

13:01.822 --> 13:04.848
Come on. Come on.

13:04.925 --> 13:06.916
Come on. Let's go.

13:06.993 --> 13:10.053
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

13:14.768 --> 13:17.862
- Hey, Alfonse, you okay? Alfonse, you all right?
- Get back!

13:17.938 --> 13:21.066
- Get back or I'll blow your head off!
- All right, take it easy.

13:21.141 --> 13:24.338
All right. Let's see, Alfonse.
Let's see. Is this your money? Huh?

13:24.411 --> 13:27.938
Here's your money, Alfonse. Is this the
hundred you offered me in court today?

13:28.014 --> 13:30.039
Eat it! Eat it!

13:34.621 --> 13:39.615
You're a damn psycho, Sipowicz!
You need some time in the country!

13:41.762 --> 13:44.663
Here, you big ape!
You want some dessert, huh?

13:44.731 --> 13:47.291
Here, Alfonse,
have a sock for dessert!

13:47.367 --> 13:50.461
Have one of the socks
I can't afford to change!

13:50.537 --> 13:54.735
- Aah!
- What's that need, Alphonse, huh?

13:54.808 --> 13:56.969
Something to spice it up?
Maybe a dash of wig?

13:57.043 --> 13:59.307
Here, go on. How's that, huh?

13:59.379 --> 14:02.246
- You think you're better than me! Is that what you think?
- Andy! Andy!

14:02.315 --> 14:05.546
- Look at me now! Laugh now,
you dick-head! - Get over here!

14:05.619 --> 14:08.554
- You get outta here!
- Breathe deep! Breathe deep!

14:08.622 --> 14:11.921
Enjoy yourself! You just made
the worst mistake of your life!

14:11.992 --> 14:14.153
- What is the matter with you?
- Stop followin' me around, will ya?

14:14.227 --> 14:18.095
- Get outta here! Stop followin'me around.
- What's the matter with you?

14:18.165 --> 14:20.963
- Stop followin' me around!
- What's goin' on, Detective?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.832
It's over.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.963
Are you all right?

14:26.039 --> 14:28.701
Yeah, I'm all right.

14:29.976 --> 14:32.570
Make sure he gets home.
He's a cop.

14:34.381 --> 14:37.544
- Come on. You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:40.921 --> 14:48.084
# Yeah #

14:48.161 --> 14:50.095
# Uh-huh #

14:51.164 --> 14:53.098
# Yeah ##

14:58.538 --> 15:01.268
- Officer Licalsi.
- Yeah?

15:01.341 --> 15:03.605
Weren't you at
the 116 out in Queens?

15:03.677 --> 15:05.668
Yeah, till last month.

15:09.216 --> 15:12.049
Who would I call over there to get
special attention on an apartment building?

15:12.118 --> 15:15.645
- Give me the address. I'll take care of it.
- Got a piece of paper?

15:15.722 --> 15:18.885
- Right.
- This is my wi...

15:18.959 --> 15:21.359
uh, ex-wife's address.

15:21.428 --> 15:25.865
There was a robbery in the basement
on Tuesday. Super didn't report it.

15:25.932 --> 15:29.060
I'll make sure a sector car keeps an eye
on it. I will too. I live out there myself.

15:29.135 --> 15:31.228
Appreciate it.

15:31.304 --> 15:33.499
I didn't realize you were,
uh, gettin' a divorce.

15:33.573 --> 15:35.803
Uh,

15:35.876 --> 15:38.572
yeah, I'm just, uh,
gettin'it done.

15:38.645 --> 15:41.808
- That's too bad.
- Yeah. Anyway, thanks a lot.

15:41.882 --> 15:43.816
Detective.

15:43.884 --> 15:45.977
Who called the rat squad?

15:46.052 --> 15:50.250
- Something to do with your partner feeding Giardella his wig last night.
- Yeah.

15:50.323 --> 15:52.757
- The restaurant owner filed a complaint.
- Where's Sipowicz?

15:52.826 --> 15:55.920
Try the men's room. They're gonna
want your statement, too, Detective.

16:09.676 --> 16:11.769
Here, open... open this for me.

16:17.284 --> 16:19.718
- You get home all right?
- Yeah.

16:23.623 --> 16:26.888
- See Internal Affairs outside?
- Yeah.

16:26.960 --> 16:30.020
- I'm screwed.
- Hey, not off the statement I'm gonna give 'em.

16:30.096 --> 16:33.224
Nah. They got me.

16:36.770 --> 16:39.238
What you said yesterday...

16:39.306 --> 16:42.036
I can't disagree.

16:42.108 --> 16:45.942
I been holdin' you down,
makin' you look bad.

16:46.012 --> 16:50.142
No, that's not the point. You stop drinking,
you get a little help for yourself...

16:50.216 --> 16:54.084
Hey, you get to a point,
the hand's been dealt and played.

16:58.658 --> 17:02.788
- Still friends, though, right?
- Oh, come on!

17:03.863 --> 17:06.991
Still friends.

17:07.067 --> 17:10.833
I.A.D. Prefers you
and Detective Sipowicz don't confer.

17:12.172 --> 17:14.106
You ready, Detective?

17:19.346 --> 17:21.280
Yeah.

17:28.855 --> 17:31.016
So, what happened last night?

17:31.091 --> 17:34.822
- Was it as bad as the club owner said?
- I didn't see very much.

17:34.894 --> 17:38.227
I'm not pairing you with anybody
till we see how this shakes out.

17:38.298 --> 17:41.859
You need a body,
use the kid in anticrime, Martinez.

17:51.311 --> 17:53.939
You got a visitor here, Detective.

17:54.014 --> 17:56.244
Detective Kelly,
I'm Josh Goldstein.

17:56.316 --> 17:59.285
- I know you from someplace. - Yeah, I'm
apartment 4-B in your ex-wife's building.

17:59.352 --> 18:02.446
Ohh! Come on. There wasn't
another robbery, was there?

18:02.522 --> 18:04.456
No, not since Tuesday.

18:04.524 --> 18:07.493
Although I did notice some suspicious
characters in the lobby last night.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.528
No, I'm an attorney, Detective.

18:09.596 --> 18:12.429
Uh, Laura asked me to provide
some additional documents...

18:12.499 --> 18:14.797
which we need to file
with the City Clerk.

18:14.868 --> 18:17.496
- We weren't gonna use lawyers.
- Oh, I'm not being compensated.

18:17.570 --> 18:22.633
She just felt the process would go more
smoothly if somebody functioned as a go-between.

18:22.709 --> 18:26.201
Sometimes we tend to get...
sidetracked.

18:26.279 --> 18:30.739
Well, if you'll fill these out,
we can meet this afternoon, actually.

18:30.817 --> 18:33.308
- How come you got a gun?
- Gun?

18:33.386 --> 18:36.981
- What...
- Yeah, in your briefcase.

18:37.057 --> 18:39.150
- You got a permit for that?
- Oh, my God, Detective.

18:39.225 --> 18:41.659
It's just because of everything
that's been going on in the building.

18:41.728 --> 18:44.094
So that's a no" on the permit.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.598
Well, no, I...
No, please, don't arrest me.

18:46.666 --> 18:49.157
- I could be disbarred. It'd kill my parents.
- Shh. Shh.

18:49.235 --> 18:51.226
It's okay. Get the permit.

18:55.075 --> 18:57.339
Now, I take these
to the City Clerk?

18:57.410 --> 19:01.346
Yeah. Um, we can meet you
there this afternoon. Is 3:00 all right?

19:02.615 --> 19:05.015
3:00.

19:05.085 --> 19:07.519
Um, I just want you to know,
Detective, uh,

19:07.587 --> 19:11.114
your wife wanted me to assure you that
there's no deepening of animosities here.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.921
- What's she cooking for you?
- Excuse me?

19:13.993 --> 19:17.292
Well, if she's not payin' ya,
she's cookin' for ya.

19:17.363 --> 19:19.627
Mm.

19:19.699 --> 19:22.964
We agreed on three dinners
in lieu of compensation.

19:23.036 --> 19:27.473
- You drive a hard bargain. What's on the menu?
- I'll happily take pot luck.

19:27.540 --> 19:31.738
Okay, um, 3:00,
City Clerk's office.

19:37.016 --> 19:40.884
- Thank you.
- James Martinez, Detective.

19:40.954 --> 19:44.856
I heard a lot about you.
Anyways, I can help.

19:44.924 --> 19:48.917
I don't know what you heard about me,
but this is a temporary assignment.

19:48.995 --> 19:51.930
- Don't unpack your bags, okay? Yeah.
- I can work with that. Yeah.

19:59.706 --> 20:04.700
Initial here to show that you declined
legal and union representation...

20:04.778 --> 20:07.747
while you were
giving the statement.

20:11.584 --> 20:15.350
From this point, Detective, you should
consider yourself on modified assignment.

20:15.421 --> 20:17.685
Your salary will continue.

20:17.757 --> 20:20.521
You'll be notified
of further disciplinary action.

20:22.228 --> 20:24.355
I'll need your gun and shield.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.351
No, John. Stay away.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.754
Detective Kelly.

20:55.263 --> 20:57.197
Line 'em up, Leon.

20:59.734 --> 21:02.464
- Hi, Andy.
- Come on. Line 'em up.

21:32.266 --> 21:34.359
All right, come on. Let's go.

21:46.314 --> 21:49.306
They're killin'me, Lois.

21:49.384 --> 21:51.511
I know, baby.

21:51.586 --> 21:55.852
They sit there, starin'at ya,
make you explain everything.

21:55.923 --> 21:59.859
- Mm-hmm. - They never been
on the streets in their lives.

22:01.963 --> 22:05.228
- Maybe I should take a shower.
- No.

22:05.299 --> 22:08.860
Later. After, hmm?

22:08.936 --> 22:11.962
- They try to make you feel like two cents.
- Mm.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.498
Come on, baby. Come to Mama.

22:17.145 --> 22:19.079
Mm-mm.

22:21.282 --> 22:23.216
Mm.

22:40.168 --> 22:42.136
- Hey, fat-ass.
- Wha...

22:43.704 --> 22:47.401
Looks like you're a creature of habit,
too, Sipowicz,

22:47.475 --> 22:49.568
only yours is gonna make you dead.

22:49.644 --> 22:53.102
- I'm sorry, Andy. I'm sorry.
- I hope you got paid a lot of money.

22:53.181 --> 22:56.412
- Wait, now. You gotta let me get outta here.
- Go ahead. Good job.

22:58.186 --> 23:00.381
I'm sorry, Andy.

23:00.455 --> 23:03.549
She got people in Orlando.

23:03.624 --> 23:05.819
- She thinks she's movin' down there.
- Yeah?

23:05.893 --> 23:08.589
Did you tell her
she could work Disney World?

23:08.663 --> 23:12.224
Say something smarter than that,
Sipowicz. You're gonna be dead a long time.

23:12.300 --> 23:16.327
I'd rather be dead than walkin' around
with that mop on my head.

24:55.069 --> 24:57.629
- Hey, hey, private club.
- Kiss my ass.

24:59.907 --> 25:01.966
He's got a badge, Mr. Marino.

25:05.980 --> 25:08.141
You know where
Alfonse Giardella is?

25:10.084 --> 25:13.076
- No.
- Did you know he shot a cop?

25:15.823 --> 25:19.224
You didn't know, did ya?

25:19.293 --> 25:23.389
He works for ya, and he didn't
get your permission, did he?

25:23.464 --> 25:26.331
Hey, who raised you
to have such a big mouth?

25:26.400 --> 25:28.334
- Let's go, pal.
- Yeah.

25:32.506 --> 25:34.997
- Tell Giardella thatJohn Kelly...
- Uuh!

25:35.076 --> 25:37.237
Wants to see him.

25:37.311 --> 25:39.871
Okay?

25:39.947 --> 25:42.472
- No hands!
- John Kelly.

25:49.156 --> 25:52.592
The hospital lists Sipowicz's condition
as extremely critical.

25:52.660 --> 25:55.026
He's bleeding too badly
for them to finish operating.

25:55.096 --> 25:58.088
The front desk'll have word
of any change.

25:59.333 --> 26:02.996
We're coordinating
with Port Authority PD,

26:03.070 --> 26:05.334
monitoring all bus,
rail and air terminals...

26:05.406 --> 26:09.035
for the prostitute whose
apartment he was shot at.

26:09.110 --> 26:13.979
Meadows and Wong are canvassing her building
in her neighborhood for any possible witnesses.

26:14.048 --> 26:16.107
Sager and French
are on Patrick's Bar.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.617
I'm handling forensics.

26:18.686 --> 26:23.055
You're all green-lighted
for any necessary overtime.

26:23.124 --> 26:27.493
This is Inspector Lastarza
of the Organized Crime Unit.

26:27.561 --> 26:30.530
Gentlemen, ladies,

26:30.598 --> 26:33.658
first, be assured that as you
investigate Detective Sipowicz's shooting,

26:33.734 --> 26:36.760
you'll receive whatever intelligence
and logistical assistance...

26:36.837 --> 26:39.203
my task force can provide.

26:39.273 --> 26:43.505
By the same token,
since task-force operations are ongoing,

26:43.577 --> 26:47.638
and involve individuals who will fall
within the margins of your investigation,

26:47.715 --> 26:52.175
it's imperative that you provide us
with notice of your activities.

26:52.253 --> 26:54.949
A costly and regrettable incident
has just occurred...

26:55.022 --> 26:58.856
as a result of an officer's
failure to so notify.

26:58.926 --> 27:02.657
I urge you all to avoid
a repetition.

27:02.730 --> 27:04.664
Good luck.

27:04.732 --> 27:06.700
Kelly. See me.

27:19.747 --> 27:23.308
- You knocked out the surveillance mike.
- Where?

27:23.384 --> 27:28.583
At the social club, Detective, when you
were doing yourJohn Wayne act for Marino.

27:28.656 --> 27:31.853
- I was putting a guy off me.
- Yeah, you planted him in the thermostat,

27:31.926 --> 27:35.794
which is where we placed our surveillance
mike, which is no longer transmitting.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.957
Hey, look, my partner got shot. I could
care about your surveillance mike.

27:39.033 --> 27:42.230
I'm hooked into the biggest crime family
in the city.

27:42.303 --> 27:45.898
I got two years
and 20,000 man-hours on the line,

27:45.973 --> 27:49.204
and I'm not gonna jeopardize that
for any one shooting victim...

27:49.276 --> 27:52.302
cop or no cop,
partner or no partner.

27:52.380 --> 27:55.406
Your officer's emotionally involved,
Lieutenant.

27:55.483 --> 28:00.682
He's out of policy. He's got no business
anywhere near this case.

28:03.424 --> 28:05.483
Is he right?

28:05.559 --> 28:08.027
That I'm emotionally involved?
Yeah. Aren't you?

28:08.095 --> 28:11.087
- Is he right that you're out of control?
- Where's this going?

28:13.367 --> 28:16.336
I want you to sit down.
Make a list of all possible suspects...

28:16.404 --> 28:19.066
- people he busted, people he pissed off...
- That's a waste of time.

28:19.140 --> 28:23.133
That's a waste of time.
So's forensics, so's lookin' for Lois.

28:23.210 --> 28:26.737
- She's either outta town or outta air.
- Are you gonna do what I ask?

28:29.383 --> 28:33.251
You want a suspect list, Lieutenant?
You got one.

28:36.824 --> 28:39.349
Your wife's downstairs.

28:39.427 --> 28:42.396
Oh, God.
I blew that 3:00.

28:55.109 --> 28:57.270
This is pretty inconsiderate,
even for you, John.

28:57.344 --> 29:00.245
The clerk's office is two subway rides
for your former wife and me.

29:00.314 --> 29:02.214
- For you, it's across the street.
- I'm sorry.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.148
You put us to
considerable inconvenience.

29:04.218 --> 29:06.243
Are you done impressing her yet?
You ready to shut your mouth?

29:06.320 --> 29:08.811
He's doing us the favor, so why don't
you dial down the macho intimidation...

29:08.889 --> 29:13.553
- Andy was shot a couple hours ago.
- Oh, my God.

29:13.627 --> 29:16.960
So, I'm sorry, but we're gonna have
to do the paperwork another time.

29:17.031 --> 29:19.795
Okay?

29:23.170 --> 29:26.628
- Hi. I'm sorry about Sipowicz.
- Hey. Yeah.

29:26.707 --> 29:29.471
I don't know what you're doing after
work. If you're going to the hospital...

29:29.543 --> 29:33.502
- He might not be alive that long.
- Well, if you want someone to ride over there with you,

29:33.581 --> 29:36.948
- or just get a beer...
- Thanks.

29:37.017 --> 29:38.951
I'll let you know.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.988
15th Precinct,

29:45.059 --> 29:47.619
Detective Squad, Officer Martinez.

29:47.695 --> 29:49.629
Hey, Juanito.

29:55.669 --> 29:58.103
Your list of suspects.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.367
This a joke? One name?

30:00.441 --> 30:04.844
Alfonse Giardella set him up. Alfonse
Giardella shot him. There are no other suspects.

30:06.647 --> 30:09.241
Well, it'll only take about 15 minutes.

30:09.316 --> 30:11.841
- You wanna get in some trouble?
- I'm up for that.

30:11.919 --> 30:14.012
- I gotta go.
- Come on.

30:19.059 --> 30:21.425
- Police!
- Hey! Whoa!

30:21.495 --> 30:25.693
Everyone zip up, wipe their hands off
and get against the back wall!

30:25.766 --> 30:27.859
That's it. Come on. Move it.

30:27.935 --> 30:30.631
- Angelo Marino. Thank him. Come on.
- Move to the side. That's it.

30:30.704 --> 30:33.366
- Atta boy. Come on. Get over here.
- Call him...

30:33.440 --> 30:35.533
- Call him when you want to be bailed out.
- Spread your legs.

30:35.609 --> 30:38.169
Thank him for the bust.
You come around. Here you go.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.745
Delivery.

30:44.818 --> 30:47.810
- Lunchtime, fellas!
- You are under arrest.

30:48.923 --> 30:51.391
- Get against the wall!
- Tell Marino...

30:51.458 --> 30:55.758
come here, Grandpa... this is because
he can't control his people.

30:55.829 --> 30:59.492
- This is for Giardella shootin' a cop.
- Spread 'em!

31:00.701 --> 31:02.635
And...

31:02.703 --> 31:05.035
Waste your time
runnin' like that, man.

31:05.105 --> 31:07.938
You're never gonna
get away from me.

31:08.008 --> 31:11.341
- Thanks for your help, Martinez.
You got real moves out there.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.937
I escaped a lot as a youth.

31:14.014 --> 31:15.948
Come here, Kelly.

31:16.016 --> 31:18.416
- Take your things out of your pocket and put 'em there.
- I want my lawyer.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.919
Just roll from the left to the right.

31:20.988 --> 31:24.424
What the hell do you
think you're doin'?

31:24.491 --> 31:27.551
- I'm gonna bleed Marino till he gives up Giardella.
- What if he gives him up dead?

31:27.628 --> 31:32.429
- That's okay too.
- I got four messages from Lastarza I haven't answered.

31:32.499 --> 31:35.559
- I'm not gonna be able to protect you if it hits the fan.
- I understand.

31:35.636 --> 31:37.729
Step over this way.

31:39.406 --> 31:41.499
Hands at your sides.

31:41.575 --> 31:44.271
Officer Licalsi.

31:44.345 --> 31:46.609
- You wanna get that beer?
- Sure.

31:53.921 --> 31:55.855
Here you go.

32:03.063 --> 32:06.499
- Was Sipowicz your first partner?
- Yep, since I got my shield.

32:06.567 --> 32:08.626
- He's tough, huh?
- Yeah.

32:08.702 --> 32:11.170
He's still hangin' on.

32:11.238 --> 32:13.968
I been afraid to go over there.

32:14.041 --> 32:17.408
My dad died in that hospital
when I was a kid, you know?

32:17.478 --> 32:20.106
- How'd he die?
- He was a cop.

32:20.180 --> 32:23.581
- Oh.
- Went through the wrong door.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.676
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Huh.

32:25.753 --> 32:28.916
- My dad's a cop too.
- Oh, yeah?

32:30.124 --> 32:33.093
- Whereabouts?
- Uptown, the 27.

32:33.160 --> 32:37.256
- My folks live in Staten Island now.
- They must be proud of you, huh?

32:37.331 --> 32:39.663
I hope so.

32:41.468 --> 32:45.165
You don't have to be at the hospital.
You were with Sipowicz when it mattered.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.508
Yeah, I don't know.

32:49.576 --> 32:52.773
You know, we got into a big beef
right before he went after Giardella.

32:52.846 --> 32:55.781
I halfway think that's why he did it,
you know?

32:55.849 --> 33:00.343
I mean, I know that's not why
he got shot, but...

33:00.421 --> 33:02.616
you know, it just seems that...

33:02.690 --> 33:06.558
no matter how much
you feel about someone...

33:06.627 --> 33:09.687
you never really get it
squared away, you know?

33:09.763 --> 33:12.732
You never really get to understand them
the way you wanted.

33:14.468 --> 33:16.732
Is that how it was with your wife?

33:21.008 --> 33:24.171
No, she blamed the job.

33:24.244 --> 33:26.508
Said I was in the street too much.

33:29.283 --> 33:32.309
Maybe she didn't meet you halfway.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.650
Maybe she didn't
know how to listen.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.020
Hmm.

33:37.091 --> 33:41.357
- There's probably enough blame
to go around there, right?

33:45.199 --> 33:47.394
You wanna get some dinner?

33:47.468 --> 33:49.402
Yeah.

33:49.470 --> 33:51.700
Yeah?

33:53.107 --> 33:56.201
May I take these? Thank you.

33:56.276 --> 33:59.609
- So what do you want to be doing in a couple of years?
- What you're doing now.

33:59.680 --> 34:04.174
I want my shield.
I heard you got yours when you were 28.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.879
Yep. I was lucky.

34:09.223 --> 34:12.021
So what do we do now?

34:13.594 --> 34:15.527
That depends on you.

34:16.630 --> 34:18.893
You're right up front, aren't you?

34:18.966 --> 34:21.297
I don't count on second chances.

34:21.368 --> 34:24.632
You're gonna think I'm weird if I tell
ya I'm not really sure what I wanna do.

34:24.705 --> 34:28.106
- I don't think you're weird.
- I was married six years. I never fooled around.

34:28.175 --> 34:31.406
- Really?
- That's right.

34:32.846 --> 34:36.690
Well... why don't we
just play it by ear?

34:40.360 --> 34:42.295
Where are we playin'?

35:25.706 --> 35:28.641
# Yeah, yeah #

35:30.577 --> 35:34.638
# Whoa, it's all right
It's all right #

35:34.715 --> 35:36.910
# Come on, come on #

35:36.984 --> 35:39.612
# Come on #

35:49.063 --> 35:52.624
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

36:03.077 --> 36:07.138
# Oh, it's all right
Come on, come on #

36:07.214 --> 36:09.580
# Come on ##

36:09.650 --> 36:12.676
Oh, yeah. Ohh.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.893
I'll be right back.

36:33.807 --> 36:36.833
- Oh, you are here.
- Hi.

36:36.910 --> 36:39.879
- You know, your phone's off the hook.
- Is that right?

36:41.982 --> 36:44.246
Is there any news about Andy?

36:44.318 --> 36:48.254
Uhh... no, he's, uh...
he's the same.

36:48.322 --> 36:51.485
Look, I'm sorry I messed up
on the papers.

36:51.558 --> 36:55.824
No. That's the last thing
you should have been thinking about.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.932
Can I come in?

37:02.436 --> 37:06.770
Uhh... I got, uh...
I got some company.

37:10.878 --> 37:12.812
Well,

37:12.880 --> 37:16.008
you're all broken up about Andy,
aren't you, John?

37:36.570 --> 37:38.970
- Let's just do what we
came here to do, all right?

37:39.039 --> 37:41.872
I'm James Sinclair,
of counsel to Alfonse Giardella.

37:41.942 --> 37:46.003
We understand that my client is wanted for
questioning in the shooting of Detective Sipowicz.

37:46.080 --> 37:49.572
Some head case rousts me in the street,
and I get harassed when he's whacked.

37:49.650 --> 37:53.746
- He ain't dead yet, Alfonse. - Hey, I
don't give a damn about your fat-ass buddy.

37:53.821 --> 37:56.449
Makes no difference to me.
I was playing cards.

37:56.523 --> 37:58.787
- You here for a statement?
- That's right.

37:58.859 --> 38:00.986
- Interview one.
- Come on, come on.

38:01.061 --> 38:04.053
You see, I know what you're trying
to do, Kelly, with me and Angelo Marino.

38:04.131 --> 38:07.589
- You can forget it. It's not gonna work.
- What I think would be useful...

38:07.668 --> 38:11.900
is that if maybe you
traced your activities,

38:11.972 --> 38:14.099
starting, say,
8:00 yesterday morning.

38:14.174 --> 38:16.108
I'm gonna trace myself.

38:16.176 --> 38:19.009
I just wanna tell this douche bag
that he's barkin' up the wrong tree.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.843
- He's making trouble for the wrong people.
- Sit down, fatso.

38:29.456 --> 38:33.586
All right. So I was on my way
to Atlantic City. I got a condo there.

38:33.660 --> 38:36.527
I arrived at my condo,

38:36.597 --> 38:39.327
and I went over to several casinos
where I lost money playing blackjack.

38:39.399 --> 38:41.594
It's all there on the ceiling cameras.
You can check it out.

38:41.668 --> 38:46.230
I arrived back at my condo, and I got a call
from my wife that you guys was lookin'for me.

38:46.306 --> 38:49.139
This was, what?
Maybe 900 last night?

38:49.209 --> 38:51.302
I drove back up this morning.

38:52.546 --> 38:55.242
- Questions, gentlemen?
- Yeah.

38:55.315 --> 38:58.079
What time did you get
to the casino yesterday?

38:58.152 --> 39:00.882
'Bout 4:00 in the afternoon.

39:00.954 --> 39:03.821
That's three and a half hours
after Sipowicz was shot.

39:03.891 --> 39:07.588
That's when I arrived. What do you want
me to say? What, is he suddenly talkin'now?

39:07.661 --> 39:10.824
He's makin' accusations? 'Cause I was
accompanied the whole drive.

39:10.898 --> 39:13.992
I got people
that can testify to that.

39:14.067 --> 39:18.367
Hey, look, I don't care what he says
in his whacked-out, deluded mind.

39:18.438 --> 39:22.204
Screw him and screw you guys!
None of this here is gonna work.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.403
Angelo Marino trusts me.

39:28.248 --> 39:31.274
- I should thank you, Detective.
- For what?

39:31.351 --> 39:34.843
This one-man crackdown of yours
has made my fiscal year.

39:34.922 --> 39:38.756
- Please, take my card if you should need to be in touch.
- Shove it, Counselor.

39:38.825 --> 39:42.317
Take the card, Detective,
and look at the address on the back.

39:43.830 --> 39:46.458
It's a restaurant I strongly recommend
for dinner tonight.

39:46.533 --> 39:48.831
Hey, Jimmy.
Come on. Let's go.

40:09.056 --> 40:11.149
Your party's here, Mr. Marino.

40:11.225 --> 40:14.217
Excuse me. I gotta look for a wire.

40:14.294 --> 40:19.197
- Hey, ya got me. Pager unit.
- It's okay, Lou.

40:19.266 --> 40:21.734
You don't mind if I hold it, huh?
That way, I won't have to take it apart.

40:21.802 --> 40:24.134
- Nah.
- Enjoy your meal.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.866
- You want something to eat, drink?
- No.

40:31.578 --> 40:35.139
This has gotta stop,
this crap in the street.

40:35.215 --> 40:40.619
- Gimme Giardella.
- We're not talking about Alfonse Giardella.

40:40.687 --> 40:44.817
If I got a problem with that, I'll take care
of it myself. We're talking about you and me.

40:44.891 --> 40:48.258
I'm sitting here politely,
I'm offering you a deal...

40:48.328 --> 40:52.594
and I'm telling you, either cut this out
or we got a serious problem, you understand?

40:52.666 --> 40:57.501
- That isn't gonna continue.
- He whacked my partner, and I want him.

40:57.571 --> 41:01.439
And I said, the problem's mine
to take care of.

41:03.810 --> 41:08.213
Now, sometimes people get justice
without getting time.

41:08.282 --> 41:10.512
Not good enough.

41:10.584 --> 41:12.518
You punk.

41:12.586 --> 41:16.420
You're gonna tell me
what's good enough?

41:16.490 --> 41:18.924
You're gonna tell me
how to run my business?

41:18.992 --> 41:23.895
You're gonna embarrass me in public?
You think you can't get hurt too?

41:23.964 --> 41:28.560
- You know what you have to do.
- You're gonna keep this up, aren't ya?

41:28.635 --> 41:31.604
Till he's mine.

41:34.374 --> 41:37.036
This thing's goin' off.

41:46.119 --> 41:48.053
What happened?

41:48.121 --> 41:50.749
I was on my way home.
I saw the radio cars.

41:50.824 --> 41:54.089
Your ex-wife, she's fine. She wasn't
involved. She knows the guy that got mugged.

41:54.161 --> 41:57.028
He was in the basement doing his laundry.
He didn't want to give up his wallet.

41:57.097 --> 41:59.565
- I can walk. This is...
- Watch it.

41:59.633 --> 42:01.999
I'm on the job.
Any description of this guy?

42:03.837 --> 42:07.238
All right. You okay, 4-B?

42:07.307 --> 42:10.606
Yeah, I'm gonna live. Guess as
a fighter, I make a great lawyer. Heh!

42:10.677 --> 42:13.646
- Is my nose broken?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

42:13.714 --> 42:17.616
Well, maybe this
is an excuse to get it fixed.

42:17.684 --> 42:20.812
Look, I'll go get my bag,
and I'll meet you in the emergency room.

42:20.887 --> 42:22.980
No, that's really not necessary.

42:24.624 --> 42:28.526
- You all right? You see anything?
- No, not till he came to my door.

42:28.595 --> 42:32.861
Maybe, uh, you go over to your mother's
till I get this guy.

42:35.168 --> 42:37.602
I didn't have a right
to do that last night.

42:37.671 --> 42:40.231
I didn't have a right to talk to you
like that when I came to your apartment.

42:40.307 --> 42:42.673
- It's all right.
- No, it isn't.

42:42.743 --> 42:46.372
You have a right to have company
the same way I do.

42:46.446 --> 42:48.880
Just because I had a hard time
living with you...

42:48.949 --> 42:51.941
- doesn't mean I'm not having a hard time living without you.
- We'll feel our way through it.

42:53.687 --> 42:56.121
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

42:56.189 --> 42:59.886
- Where are they takin' him?
- Queen's General.

43:01.428 --> 43:04.226
- Nothing new on Andy?
- No.

43:09.469 --> 43:11.562
Take care of yourself, all right?

43:13.974 --> 43:15.908
See you, John.

43:25.419 --> 43:27.546
- She's okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

43:27.621 --> 43:32.388
- Uh, hey, thanks for stopping, you know.
- No problem.

43:32.459 --> 43:36.259
- What about us?
- We're fine. We're fine.

43:36.329 --> 43:39.730
- I'll call you later. All right?
- Okay.

43:42.569 --> 43:44.662
- Take care, all right?
- I will.

44:29.349 --> 44:31.817
Mr. Marino. You wanted to see me?

44:31.885 --> 44:36.151
This guy won't hear reason.
Is that your impression?

44:36.223 --> 44:39.715
That Kelly won't back off?

44:39.793 --> 44:42.159
I'm not sure.
He's pretty upset about his partner.

44:42.229 --> 44:44.288
Not sure?

44:44.364 --> 44:47.959
You're screwin' the guy,
and you're not sure?

44:48.034 --> 44:50.434
All right.

44:50.504 --> 44:52.597
I want you to kill him.

44:54.474 --> 44:56.567
How am I gonna do that?

44:56.643 --> 45:00.636
You're a cop.
You'll figure something out.

45:49.696 --> 45:54.258
I'm sorry I didn't...
I didn't get here till now, buddy. L...

45:56.670 --> 46:01.903
I had a bad experience here...
you know, my dad, and, uh...

46:01.975 --> 46:03.909
You know about that.

46:07.847 --> 46:11.544
I don't know... I don't know
if you can hear me, or what.

46:11.618 --> 46:13.848
I don't know.

46:13.920 --> 46:16.184
I don't know what's goin' on
in your head.

46:17.791 --> 46:19.725
But, uh...

46:21.494 --> 46:23.928
I'm sorry.

46:23.997 --> 46:26.397
You know, I wished I coulda
helped you more, you know?

46:26.466 --> 46:28.400
I just...

46:30.403 --> 46:33.998
Uh, I'm grateful for the way...

46:34.074 --> 46:37.737
you... you treated me... coming up,

46:37.811 --> 46:39.745
and, uh...

46:43.483 --> 46:45.747
you were like a father to me, man.

46:51.324 --> 46:54.657
And, uh... if this is good-bye,

47:06.706 --> 47:11.609
I came here to tell you that you're
the toughest bastard I ever met...

47:11.678 --> 47:13.771
and I'm not countin' you out.

47:15.181 --> 47:17.274
I'm not countin' you out.

47:35.733 --> 47:37.667
Andy?
