01:21.148 --> 01:24.383
Black Friday is the one
holiday everyone can agree on.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.618
Because everyone
loves a bargain.

01:26.620 --> 01:31.824
Standing in long lines, so you
can buy things for 70% off is
the ultimate act of love.

No, these are ghost robes.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.475
You look like
the belle of the ball.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.210
Oh-ho! Beautiful!

02:25.212 --> 02:27.613
These are old-timey
pajamas, not a gown!

02:27.615 --> 02:30.015
Now, I have
something to show you.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.283
Come with me.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.318
I feel so under the dressed.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.887
It's just a robe!

02:37.457 --> 02:39.391
(GASPS) It is the me!

02:39.393 --> 02:43.362
It was the you.
That is your past self.

02:43.364 --> 02:47.533
I recall this day.
The Black Friday of last year.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.168
Yes.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.471
You wanted to buy
a surround sound system
for a low-low price.

02:52.473 --> 02:57.109
I wished for my friend
Titans to enjoy the sound

-Ah.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.994
If you had thrown an elbow,

03:15.996 --> 03:18.263
you could have
purchased that item.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.265
The item was unimportant.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.466
Was it?

03:21.468 --> 03:23.001
Come and see.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.671
Ooh, are we going
to your princess' castle?

03:25.673 --> 03:29.741
There is no castle!
And I am not a princess!
Because this is not a dress!

03:31.811 --> 03:33.946
You came home and went to bed.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.481

truly cause my friends

we should spend the time

meaning of Black Friday.

reason for the season, Star.
