going to be accountability,

05:38.677 --> 05:42.079

Um, I'm... I-I don't know
what you mean, sir.

go last week in hopes

05:48.018 --> 05:49.218

you to Wo Fat.

not the little fish under him.

going to be

06:00.795 --> 06:02.661
consequences for that,
as I said there would be.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.662
- What kind of consequences?
- Officer Weston.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.330
- Sir.
- I'm sure you thought,

06:06.398 --> 06:08.398
coming here, you were
going to be appointed

06:08.466 --> 06:10.100
my new public
safety liaison,

06:10.168 --> 06:11.669

06:11.736 --> 06:13.604
a different position
in mind for you.

06:15.706 --> 06:17.807
- Wait a minute.
- Sir, if this has something to do...

06:17.875 --> 06:19.109
That's right.

06:19.177 --> 06:20.944
Officer Weston,
welcome to Five-O.

06:21.011 --> 06:21.945
Sir, we're not really

06:22.012 --> 06:24.014

06:24.081 --> 06:26.016
- No offense.
- None taken.

really do appreciate you thinking
of me replacing Officer Kalakaua...

06:34.893 --> 06:36.628
for this position...
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

06:36.695 --> 06:38.431
- I'm not looking to be a babysitter.
- Time-out! Time-out!

06:38.498 --> 06:40.201
Babysitter?

06:40.268 --> 06:41.936
Time-out.

06:42.004 --> 06:44.706
This is not about
Officer Kalakaua,

06:44.774 --> 06:46.708
and I'm not asking
you to babysit.

06:46.776 --> 06:48.855

be a part of a team

06:48.856 --> 06:50.957
that is vital to this state's safety.

06:51.048 --> 06:53.551

I'm telling.

06:53.618 --> 06:54.952
I need to take this.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.887
- Then you should take it.
- Excuse me.

06:58.756 --> 07:00.089

so, uh, I have to go.

07:07.199 --> 07:08.265
Then get on it.

07:10.969 --> 07:12.735
- Sir, I really don't...
- What are you still doing here?

07:12.803 --> 07:14.169
You've got a case.

07:15.705 --> 07:16.905
Go.

07:17.973 --> 07:19.606
Yes, sir.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.075
I know neither of
us expected this,

07:23.143 --> 07:25.110
but let's just try and
make the best of it.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.512
You ever work
a kidnapping case before?

07:26.580 --> 07:27.913
I started my career
with the FBI.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.315
- That's not what I asked.
- I was in profiling.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.517
- You're avoiding the question.
- Five cases.

07:34.486 --> 07:36.486
And how many of those cases
ended successfully?

07:36.554 --> 07:38.487
Three.

07:39.955 --> 07:41.990
I'll drive.

07:42.057 --> 07:43.625
I'll follow you.

07:50.306 --> 07:51.641
Wow. Look at you.

07:51.708 --> 07:52.976
You clean up nice, babe.

07:53.045 --> 07:54.581
You got all dressed up
for the new governor?

07:54.648 --> 07:55.850
- Win you any points?
- Not exactly.

07:55.918 --> 07:57.289
Danny Williams, this is

07:57.357 --> 07:59.897

08:00.967 --> 08:01.901
- Our new what?
- Partner.

08:01.968 --> 08:03.937
Governor Denning assigned me

- To do what?

08:05.840 --> 08:08.776
- Uh, assist you in any way I can.
- I'm sorry.

08:08.844 --> 08:10.878
I'm pretty sure the word
you used earlier was "babysit."

08:10.946 --> 08:13.380
- You're going to babysit us.
- Oh, okay, I'm-I... I apol... I...

08:13.448 --> 08:14.682

womb and kindergarten.

Abductor drove off

08:24.559 --> 08:26.093
Her mother got a

08:26.161 --> 08:27.961

08:28.029 --> 08:29.329
Just hit the wire
a few minutes ago.

08:29.397 --> 08:30.597
- Run that.
- Teenage girls

08:30.665 --> 08:32.399
are usually kidnapped
for one of two reasons:

08:32.467 --> 08:33.734
ransom or a sex crime.

08:33.801 --> 08:35.635
- Where are the parents?
- Over there.

09:01.063 --> 09:02.497
<i>Any strange phone calls?</i>

09:02.565 --> 09:04.099
Anything at all
out of the ordinary

09:04.166 --> 09:05.533
last couple weeks?

09:05.601 --> 09:07.669
- No.
- In over half of all

09:07.737 --> 09:08.970
kidnapping cases,
the abductor

09:09.038 --> 09:10.439
is usually a relative
or an acquaintance

09:10.506 --> 09:12.674
of the victim.
Is there anybody you can think of

09:12.742 --> 09:13.858
that would have reason
to want to take Jen?

09:13.883 --> 09:15.083
No.

09:15.177 --> 09:17.145
All right. I'm going to send
some of our people

09:17.213 --> 09:18.713
to your house--
they're going to set up

09:18.781 --> 09:20.983
phone taps in preparation
for a ransom call.

09:21.051 --> 09:22.051
Okay? Officer Weston

09:22.119 --> 09:23.452
is going to
accompany you home.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.721
She's going to supervise
the whole thing, all right?

09:25.789 --> 09:27.589
- Okay?
- Got something.

09:29.592 --> 09:32.627
- Oh, my God.
- I found this outside the changing tent.

09:32.694 --> 09:34.828
Does it belong to Jen?

09:34.896 --> 09:37.030
Jen was born with
a heart condition.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.832
She has to take this
medication twice a day.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.033
If she doesn't
get this

09:40.101 --> 09:41.467
within 24 hours,

09:41.535 --> 09:43.036
she could...

09:43.104 --> 09:44.304
She could die.

09:45.773 --> 09:47.241
That's not going to happen.

10:06.535 --> 10:08.069
- Hey.
- Good. You're here.

10:10.438 --> 10:11.705
What do you got?

10:11.773 --> 10:12.973
HPD reports all

10:13.041 --> 10:14.675
registered sex offenders
within five miles

10:14.743 --> 10:17.044
of the abduction site
have been accounted for.

10:17.112 --> 10:18.346
They're expanding
the search now.

10:18.414 --> 10:19.680
Okay.

10:19.748 --> 10:21.482
Uh, what about Jen's
personal life? Anything?

10:21.549 --> 10:24.551
I scanned Jen's cell records
and social network profile.

10:24.619 --> 10:26.520
Everything's clean--
no suspicious messages,

10:26.587 --> 10:28.622
no strange calls,
nothing to indicate

10:28.690 --> 10:30.657
- a potential threat.
- All right, see,

10:30.725 --> 10:31.791
this is strange.

10:31.859 --> 10:32.859
All right,
she's got nothing personal

10:32.927 --> 10:34.127
on her home page, right?

10:34.194 --> 10:36.029
It's all generic
publicity stuff.

10:36.097 --> 10:38.098
I mean, kids use
these sites to vent,

10:38.166 --> 10:40.566
all right, share secrets,
talk trash to each other.

10:40.634 --> 10:41.901
It's like Jen
doesn't want anyone

10:41.969 --> 10:43.970
to know who she really is.
Okay, well,

10:44.038 --> 10:45.572
maybe she had
a secret profile somewhere.

10:45.639 --> 10:46.973
- Keep looking.
- Get Jen's laptop, okay?

10:47.041 --> 10:48.975
Mine it and see if you can find
anything that she was trying

10:49.043 --> 10:50.544
to keep away from her parents.
- Got it.

10:50.612 --> 10:52.847
Hey, just got off
the phone with HPD.

10:52.915 --> 10:54.681
MAILE Alert lines
are ringing off the hook.

10:54.749 --> 10:56.316
I'm going to have
to head back to the station

10:56.383 --> 10:58.218
to coordinate a grid search.
- Keep us posted, all right?

10:58.285 --> 10:59.352
Yeah.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.455
Hey. So what do we know
about the new hire?

11:01.523 --> 11:02.557
She's cute.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.491
- She's very cute.
- She's attractive.

11:04.559 --> 11:06.859
- She used to work for Homeland Security.
- That could come in handy.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.661
Yeah, if she lasts.

11:08.728 --> 11:09.862
What? Why wouldn't she last?

11:09.929 --> 11:11.430
Well, let's see
what she looks like

11:11.497 --> 11:13.598
when she gets done with
Sergeant Slaughter's boot camp.

11:15.935 --> 11:17.836
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Let's just try

11:17.904 --> 11:19.238
and not get the new girl

11:19.306 --> 11:20.773
blown up, kidnapped, shot

11:20.841 --> 11:22.342
on her first day, that's all.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.010
Can we do that, Steven?

11:24.078 --> 11:26.379
I can't guarantee that.

11:44.031 --> 11:45.298
Hands on your head.

11:45.365 --> 11:48.702
Turn around slowly.

11:51.206 --> 11:52.806
Do you hear me?

11:55.543 --> 11:57.310
I'm not gonna ask again.

11:57.378 --> 11:58.778
Shh.

12:01.882 --> 12:03.450
Wow.

12:03.517 --> 12:07.120
You seem to have a lot of people
who really, uh,

12:07.188 --> 12:08.688
cared about you.

12:12.727 --> 12:14.994
That's nice.

12:15.062 --> 12:17.096
Who the hell are you?

12:17.164 --> 12:19.965
You might want to sit down.

12:25.739 --> 12:28.807
<i>Danny was right.</i>

12:28.875 --> 12:30.008
Jen was hiding something.

12:30.076 --> 12:31.578
She has a second
social network profile.

12:31.646 --> 12:32.779
I managed to extract

12:32.846 --> 12:34.479
all of the deleted e-mails
and private chats

12:34.547 --> 12:36.814
and I found a bunch of
exchanges with a guy named

12:36.882 --> 12:38.282
Brant Cunningham.

12:38.350 --> 12:40.150
What do we know about him?

12:40.218 --> 12:41.251
Not much.

12:41.319 --> 12:42.852
But everything about it
screams predator.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.287
The account is brand-new,

12:44.355 --> 12:46.290
the only e-mails he sent were
to Jen, and that profile picture

12:46.358 --> 12:47.591
is a stock shot
of a male model

12:47.659 --> 12:49.593
I identified through
facial recognition.

12:49.661 --> 12:51.861
All right, when was the last
time they exchanged e-mails?

12:51.929 --> 12:53.362
Last week.
He asked for her address.

12:53.430 --> 12:56.065
Said he wanted to
send her something.

12:58.535 --> 13:01.538
Guys, I'm not seeing anything
from a Brant Cunningham here.

13:01.605 --> 13:03.139
And the parents don't remember
Jen getting

13:03.207 --> 13:04.375
anything from that name, either.

13:04.442 --> 13:05.643
Okay, it's got to be there.

13:05.711 --> 13:07.678
Well, it's not in her fan mail,

13:07.746 --> 13:10.613
which means she's hiding it.

13:10.681 --> 13:12.848
Wait, this is a girl who's
deleting her private e-mails

13:12.916 --> 13:13.949
from this guy, right?

13:14.017 --> 13:15.318
Yeah. Most likely
she didn't want

13:15.386 --> 13:16.786
her parents to find it.

13:16.854 --> 13:19.356
Huh. Which rules out the sock
drawer and under the mattress.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.391
Check for loose
floorboards.

13:21.458 --> 13:22.458
No.

13:22.526 --> 13:24.727
The room's carpeted.

13:24.795 --> 13:26.896
This is a good kid.

13:26.964 --> 13:28.498
According to her mom,
she's perfect.

13:28.565 --> 13:31.734
She does what she's told,
keeps her room clean.

13:31.802 --> 13:34.403
I mean, she's about to go on
a 32-mile race

13:34.471 --> 13:36.540
and still remembers to make
her bed in the morning.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.243
Clearly, appearances
are important to her.

13:39.311 --> 13:42.213
Along with her accomplishments.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.053
I found something.

13:50.121 --> 13:50.888
What do you got?

13:54.626 --> 13:56.694
Guys, the Hassleys
aren't Jen's parents.

13:57.930 --> 13:59.364
<i>"This is your birth mother,</i>

13:59.431 --> 14:02.200
"and she would
like to meet you.

14:02.268 --> 14:04.536
"If you want to know more,
meet me behind the changing tent

14:04.603 --> 14:06.871
after your race
on Saturday."

14:06.939 --> 14:09.174
Jen has always known
she was adopted.

14:09.242 --> 14:11.110
We've been very open
with her about it.

14:11.177 --> 14:12.378
Jen's real mother

14:12.446 --> 14:14.447
died in childbirth.

14:14.515 --> 14:15.915
It was in the adoption records.

14:15.983 --> 14:17.950
Jen knows that.
I just can't believe

14:18.017 --> 14:19.552
she arranged
to meet this person

14:19.619 --> 14:20.787
and didn't say
anything about it.

14:20.854 --> 14:23.022
I don't know
why she'd lie to us.

14:25.292 --> 14:26.625
Yeah, well, my guess is

14:26.693 --> 14:28.561
Jen's abductor
found out she was adopted,

14:28.628 --> 14:30.063
fabricated information
about her birth mother

14:30.130 --> 14:32.332
and used that into luring her
to meet up him.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.934
Okay, so it had to be someone
who knew she was adopted.

14:34.002 --> 14:35.403
Well, she talked about it

14:35.470 --> 14:37.071
in her interview
for <i>Aloha Life</i> magazine.

14:37.139 --> 14:39.073
I mean, thousands of people
could know.

14:39.141 --> 14:41.476
I'm gonna go take this letter
to the crime lab,

14:41.544 --> 14:42.978
see if I can get
a print off of it.

14:43.046 --> 14:44.013
All right, hold on, hold on.

14:44.080 --> 14:44.914
Let Kaye take the letter.

14:44.982 --> 14:45.915
Lori, I need you to

14:45.983 --> 14:47.350
stay with the
family, okay?

14:47.418 --> 14:49.752
Okay.

14:49.820 --> 14:50.985
And, Lori...

14:51.053 --> 14:52.152
Yeah?

14:52.220 --> 14:53.286
Nice work.

14:53.353 --> 14:56.587
Thanks.

14:56.655 --> 14:58.922
And nice work to you, too.
That's good.

14:58.990 --> 14:59.923
What?

14:59.991 --> 15:02.257
"I want you to stay
with the family."

15:02.325 --> 15:04.624
I mean, you're keeping
this woman at arm's distance.

15:04.692 --> 15:06.025
Is it because she's

15:06.092 --> 15:09.127
the governor's hire or is it
something else? Just curious.

15:09.194 --> 15:10.328
Hey, MAILE Alert paid off.

15:10.395 --> 15:11.496
Found our abductor's car.

15:11.563 --> 15:13.364
Kam Highway,
southern edge of Wheeler.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.218
Nobody.

15:31.286 --> 15:32.920
It's empty.
Check the trunk.

15:40.897 --> 15:42.998
I got blood.

15:43.933 --> 15:46.935
And Jen's jacket.

15:55.890 --> 15:57.357
<i>What do you got, Max?</i>

15:57.425 --> 16:00.460
The amount of blood I found
on the jacket and in the trunk

16:00.528 --> 16:01.495
is quite troubling.

16:01.562 --> 16:03.630
Approximately
six to seven pints.

16:03.698 --> 16:06.166
The odds of anyone surviving
after that much blood loss

16:06.234 --> 16:07.467
is quite low.

16:07.535 --> 16:09.168
Okay, but you're saying,
I mean, it's possible

16:09.235 --> 16:10.235
she could still
be alive, right?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.369
How old is the girl
you're looking for?

16:11.436 --> 16:13.203
She's, uh, 15.
About 90 pounds.

16:13.271 --> 16:14.837
About.

16:14.905 --> 16:18.374
If this is her blood,
I find it highly doubtful

16:18.442 --> 16:20.076
that she could
have survived.

16:22.012 --> 16:23.579
Listen to me, Max.

16:23.647 --> 16:24.847
I need you to
run this, okay?

16:24.915 --> 16:26.148
Because I can't
talk to the parents

16:26.216 --> 16:27.984
until I know what we
have, you understand?

16:28.051 --> 16:29.518
I'm on it.

16:30.787 --> 16:32.354
<i>Suspect's VIN number:</i>

16:32.422 --> 16:36.359
<i>17Q4378OI95</i>

16:36.427 --> 16:39.164
39572.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.166
Got it.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.534
Running it now.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.103
Here we go.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.505
Your car is registered
to a Matt Porter.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.074
4810 Loho Street in Kailua.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.946
Matthew Porter! Five-O!

17:01.620 --> 17:02.786
Clear.

17:02.854 --> 17:04.488
All clear here.

17:04.556 --> 17:05.856
No Porter, no Jen.

17:05.923 --> 17:07.523
But you guys should see this.

17:14.131 --> 17:15.298
That's Jen right there.

17:17.967 --> 17:19.001
Who are these
other women?

17:19.068 --> 17:20.734
Victims.

17:20.801 --> 17:22.536
Yeah. Or potential victims.

17:26.008 --> 17:27.375
Take a look at these.

17:27.443 --> 17:30.046
Sam Baker, Todd Kilgore,
Charles Tetchy.

17:30.114 --> 17:32.048
He's got, like, 30 of these.

17:32.116 --> 17:33.749
This guy's been at it awhile.

17:33.817 --> 17:37.286
Yep. And he knows
how to disappear.

17:37.354 --> 17:38.987
Message two.

17:39.055 --> 17:40.155
Hi, Julie, it's Beth.

17:40.223 --> 17:41.590
Yeah.

17:41.658 --> 17:43.591
That's great.
Okay, thank you.

17:43.659 --> 17:45.193
That was the TSA;
they have an alert out

17:45.260 --> 17:46.695
on all the names that
Porter's been using.

17:46.763 --> 17:48.397
- All right, we check plane tickets?
- Yes, we did.

17:48.464 --> 17:49.965
There's nothing been purchased
under these names.

17:50.032 --> 17:51.867
Okay, good. So Porter
might still be on the island.

17:51.934 --> 17:54.402
Right. Unless he got off using
an alias we don't know about.

17:54.470 --> 17:55.502
We're running out of time

17:55.570 --> 17:56.904
to get Jen her medication.
- Come on!

17:56.971 --> 17:58.138
What do we got?
Something, something.

17:58.206 --> 17:59.440
I'm working as fast as I can.

17:59.507 --> 18:00.808
You putting pressure on
an already stressful situation

18:00.875 --> 18:02.143
is not gonna make me
work any faster.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.445
I can't even verify
that Matt Porter

18:03.513 --> 18:04.679
is his real name.
- Okay, whoa, whoa.

18:04.747 --> 18:06.448
Look, I don't know
what his real name is, either,

18:06.516 --> 18:09.151
but I do know that one of his
aliases, Todd Kilgore, is wanted

18:09.218 --> 18:11.319
for questioning in a 2009
kidnapping case in Nebraska.

18:11.387 --> 18:12.653
Okay, good, good, good.

18:12.721 --> 18:14.221
So Jen isn't his first victim.

18:14.289 --> 18:15.055
Or his last.

18:15.123 --> 18:16.323
What do you got?

18:16.391 --> 18:18.126
Julie Nells.

18:18.193 --> 18:20.895
I managed to get into her voice
mail and found a message that

18:20.963 --> 18:22.997
Porter left for her yesterday.
He asked her to meet him.

18:23.064 --> 18:24.732
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.,
Wailana Coffee House.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.033
All right.
Hey.

18:26.101 --> 18:27.434
Hey, you're supposed to
be at the Hassleys'.

18:27.502 --> 18:28.969
What's up? You all right?

18:29.037 --> 18:30.471
Yeah, yeah.
You got a second?

18:30.538 --> 18:31.505
Yeah, sure.

18:31.572 --> 18:34.007
Good work.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.443
How are the Hassleys doing?

18:37.511 --> 18:38.511
They're a mess.

18:38.579 --> 18:40.180
I mean, they're waiting
on a ransom call

18:40.247 --> 18:41.447
that you and I both
know isn't coming.

18:41.515 --> 18:42.514
What are you talking about?

18:42.582 --> 18:44.183
Look, I get that
you don't want me here.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.484
It's your team,
I wasn't your choice.

18:46.552 --> 18:48.186
But sidelining me is just
a waste of your resources.

18:48.253 --> 18:51.488
Okay, first of all, I put
my resources where I need them.

18:51.556 --> 18:52.823
- I needed somebody on the phone.
- Come on.

18:52.891 --> 18:53.825
I looked into
the Hassleys' financials.

18:53.893 --> 18:55.026
They don't make any money.

18:55.094 --> 18:56.828
Jen hasn't signed any
endorsement deals.

18:56.896 --> 18:59.264
Her kidnapping was never
about ransom, and you know that.

18:59.331 --> 19:00.665
You just wanted me
out of your hair.

19:00.733 --> 19:01.666
Fine.

19:01.734 --> 19:03.201
- Fine?
- Yeah.

19:03.269 --> 19:04.402
Fine.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.970
I sidelined you.

19:06.038 --> 19:08.107
Well, at least you're man enough
to admit it.

19:08.175 --> 19:10.976
Lori, we met this morning.

19:11.043 --> 19:12.110
You expect me to trust you

19:12.178 --> 19:13.644
the way I trust
these people out here?

19:13.712 --> 19:16.113
I've been in the field
with these people,

19:16.181 --> 19:18.315
they've had my back,
I trust them with my life.

19:18.382 --> 19:20.018
The Hassleys are trusting me
with Jen's life,

19:20.085 --> 19:21.620
and I promised them I'd bring

19:21.688 --> 19:23.688
their daughter home.
- Okay, well, there's your first mistake

19:23.755 --> 19:25.690
right there.
- Excuse me?

19:25.758 --> 19:27.058
We don't make promises
like that around here.

19:27.126 --> 19:29.061
Oh, really? Well, I do.

19:30.763 --> 19:32.630
Those two kidnapping cases
that went south--

19:32.698 --> 19:34.966
did you make the same promise
to those families?

19:35.033 --> 19:37.201
Yeah. I did.
And I don't regret it.

19:37.268 --> 19:38.535
Sometimes you make

19:38.603 --> 19:41.071
all the right moves and
it just isn't enough.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.439
You know, the Hassleys
are no different.

19:42.507 --> 19:44.040
I intend to keep
my promise to them.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.211
Hey, wait.

19:51.681 --> 19:54.649
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.,
Wailana Coffee House.

19:54.717 --> 19:56.318
Meet me there, okay?

19:59.922 --> 20:02.124
Wait a minute.

20:02.191 --> 20:03.959
So you're saying
he was in your house?

20:04.027 --> 20:05.561
Yeah.

20:05.628 --> 20:07.629
This is Captain Fryer, the
head of Internal Affairs?

20:08.932 --> 20:11.200
What did he want?

20:11.267 --> 20:13.302
He, uh, he asked me
a lot of questions

20:13.370 --> 20:14.570
about the asset
forfeiture locker

20:14.637 --> 20:16.438
and the money
that they said I stole.

20:16.505 --> 20:19.273
I don't understand. You answered
all those questions already.

20:19.341 --> 20:21.776
Yeah, well, he wanted
to see my face.

20:21.843 --> 20:23.878
See if I was
a good liar.

20:23.946 --> 20:26.581
There's something else,
isn't there?

20:31.320 --> 20:33.589
IA's ruling on my case tomorrow.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.292
Here, come here.

20:40.797 --> 20:43.263
It's gonna be fine, okay?

20:45.299 --> 20:46.766
They got nothing.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.382
Porter's late.

21:02.449 --> 21:05.652
Yeah. ' show.

21:06.620 --> 21:07.954
Thank you.

21:08.022 --> 21:09.455
Don't you just hate that?

21:09.523 --> 21:11.090
Hate what?

21:11.158 --> 21:12.291
The top off.

21:12.359 --> 21:14.093
You know, you get
just the right mix going--

21:14.161 --> 21:16.795
coffee, cream, sugar--
all working in perfect harmony.

21:16.863 --> 21:19.431
Then, when you're not looking,
waitress comes, tops you off.

21:19.499 --> 21:21.567
Ruins a perfectly good
cup of coffee.

21:21.635 --> 21:23.702
That's why I switched to tea;
they don't mess with that.

21:25.305 --> 21:27.139
What?

21:27.207 --> 21:28.774
I'm just saying.

21:31.978 --> 21:33.746
Told you.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.447
When you're right, you're right.

21:35.515 --> 21:38.317
You know, I expected
somebody who graduated

21:38.385 --> 21:39.718
top of his BUD/S class

21:39.786 --> 21:42.154
would take his coffee black,
but mm-mm.

21:46.492 --> 21:49.126
Did you pull my file?

21:49.194 --> 21:51.162
Mm-hmm. Last night.

21:51.229 --> 21:53.364
Which is when I assume
you pulled mine.

21:58.270 --> 22:01.172
You graduated with
honors from Penn State,

22:01.240 --> 22:02.973
but you switched from
bio to criminal justice

22:03.041 --> 22:04.842
in your sophomore year.
- Mm-hmm.

22:04.910 --> 22:07.044
What happened,
you couldn't hack the sciences?

22:07.112 --> 22:09.513
Uh-huh, something like that.

22:09.581 --> 22:10.481
Hmm.

22:10.549 --> 22:13.051
Yeah, phys ed was
more my style.

22:13.118 --> 22:14.452
Phys ed?

22:14.520 --> 22:15.687
You care to
elaborate on that?

22:15.755 --> 22:17.122
Uh-uh.

22:17.189 --> 22:18.356
Maybe when I know you better.

22:18.424 --> 22:21.226
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:21.294 --> 22:22.227
Hey, any sign

22:22.295 --> 22:23.228
of Porter out there?

22:23.296 --> 22:24.229
No.

22:24.297 --> 22:25.063
How's the date going,

22:25.131 --> 22:26.665
buddy?

22:26.733 --> 22:27.866
Chin?

22:28.937 --> 22:30.538
You didn't answer
Danny's question.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.942
I will take that as
no sign of Porter.

22:39.146 --> 22:40.180
I think she's done waiting.

22:40.247 --> 22:43.115
Let me see if I can stall her.

22:44.884 --> 22:46.518
Hey, you're Julie Nells, right?

22:46.586 --> 22:48.320
I'm Lo...
Julie, wait!

22:48.388 --> 22:49.188
She's running, she's running.

22:55.962 --> 22:58.564
Move, move.

23:06.442 --> 23:08.410
Whoa!

23:08.478 --> 23:09.745
Hey!

23:09.813 --> 23:10.947
Julie!

23:11.014 --> 23:13.685
Whoa, whoa, come here,
come here.

23:13.752 --> 23:15.287
Get away from me,
I'm not going back!

23:15.355 --> 23:16.689
Julie, it's okay,
we're not here to hurt you.

23:16.757 --> 23:18.357
Where's Matt?
What did you do to Matt?

23:18.425 --> 23:19.558
Listen to me,
hey, hey, we're Five-O.

23:19.626 --> 23:21.027
Look, okay,

23:21.094 --> 23:22.795
we just want to talk to you.
- What do you want from me?

23:22.863 --> 23:24.596
We're just looking
for Matt Porter.

23:24.664 --> 23:25.697
Why?

23:25.765 --> 23:26.865
Because we
think he might

23:26.933 --> 23:28.200
be trying to hurt you,
that's all.

23:28.267 --> 23:30.268
Matt?

23:32.003 --> 23:33.938
He wouldn't hurt me.

23:34.005 --> 23:35.405
He saved my life.

23:41.944 --> 23:43.979
Matt Porter rescued me from
a cult in Northern California.

23:44.046 --> 23:46.214
What do you mean "rescued"?

23:46.282 --> 23:47.849
That's what he does.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.217
He's an extractor.

23:49.285 --> 23:51.252
Two years ago

23:51.320 --> 23:55.557
I joined this religious movement
near Mount Shasta.

23:55.625 --> 24:00.128
When things changed, I tried to
leave, but they wouldn't let me

24:00.196 --> 24:02.330
and they've been
after me ever since,

24:02.398 --> 24:03.431
so I called Matt.

24:03.499 --> 24:05.066
He was supposed
to meet me this morning

24:05.133 --> 24:06.701
to help me disappear for good.

24:06.802 --> 24:08.736
So why did you
run from us?

24:08.804 --> 24:11.905
Matt said they might send
some people after me.

24:11.973 --> 24:13.807
I'm scared.

24:13.875 --> 24:14.942
I won't go back there.

24:15.010 --> 24:17.211
Okay, okay.

24:17.279 --> 24:19.080
When was the last time
you spoke to Matt?

24:19.147 --> 24:20.948
Two days ago.

24:21.016 --> 24:22.383
Okay, how did you contact him?

24:23.418 --> 24:24.518
Matt's got a private number

24:24.586 --> 24:26.020
he only gives out
to people he's helping.

24:26.087 --> 24:28.755
Okay, we're going to need
that number, okay?

24:28.823 --> 24:30.223
Thanks.

24:32.026 --> 24:34.027
Excuse us.

24:37.498 --> 24:39.432
This doesn't make
any sense.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.868
I mean, Jen wasn't
in a cult.

24:40.935 --> 24:42.970
She didn't need
to be saved.

24:43.038 --> 24:44.105
Why would Porter kidnap her?

24:44.173 --> 24:45.640
- I don't know.
- I just got

24:45.708 --> 24:47.041
off the phone with Max
and he ran tests

24:47.109 --> 24:48.843
on the blood we found
in the trunk of Porter's car.

24:48.911 --> 24:49.844
It's not Jen's.

24:49.912 --> 24:50.912
Oh, that's great news.

24:50.979 --> 24:52.480
Okay, so she
could be alive.

24:52.548 --> 24:53.481
Well, that's the good news.

24:53.549 --> 24:54.949
The bad news is that the blood

24:55.017 --> 24:56.284
we found in the trunk
was a match

24:56.351 --> 24:58.319
to a John Doe gunshot victim

24:58.387 --> 24:59.887
HPD found
this morning.

24:59.955 --> 25:02.022
Max ran some DNA
and got that hit.

25:04.893 --> 25:07.094
That's Matt Porter.

25:08.263 --> 25:10.164
So where's Jen Hassley?

25:25.076 --> 25:26.810
According to Max,
Matt Porter was killed

25:26.878 --> 25:28.445
and placed in the trunk
of his car

25:28.513 --> 25:30.748
somewhere between 8:00 p.m.
and 11:00 p.m. on Saturday

25:30.815 --> 25:32.015
and more than likely

25:32.083 --> 25:33.750
dumped along the Kamehameha
Highway shortly thereafter.

25:33.818 --> 25:35.686
Okay, well,
Porter's not our guy.

25:35.753 --> 25:37.354
Jen was abducted
on a Sunday morning.

25:37.422 --> 25:39.323
Guys, I just got a
strange hit on an alias

25:39.390 --> 25:40.791
that Porter was using.

25:40.859 --> 25:41.592
Which one?

25:41.659 --> 25:42.826
James Westerfield-- it says here

25:42.894 --> 25:44.261
in Jen's adoption records
that he was the one

25:44.329 --> 25:45.362
who delivered Jen
to the Hassleys

25:45.430 --> 25:47.264
15 years ago.
Okay, wait a minute.

25:47.332 --> 25:48.265
If Porter

25:48.332 --> 25:49.633
was an extractor
back then,

25:49.701 --> 25:51.301
maybe Jen's biological parents

25:51.369 --> 25:52.502
were actually
in a cult.

25:52.570 --> 25:53.736
What if her parents
found out where she was

25:53.804 --> 25:55.004
and they just
wanted her back?

25:55.072 --> 25:56.506
This could be how
they found her.

25:56.573 --> 25:58.708
She's been in the
press a lot lately.

25:58.776 --> 26:00.977
- Maybe somebody put two and two together.
- All right, we need to find out

26:01.045 --> 26:03.313
which cult Porter extracted her
from because that's where Jen is

26:03.381 --> 26:05.114
right now.

26:23.432 --> 26:25.432
We're ready for you.

26:43.119 --> 26:45.286
I think I found something
that may help narrow down

26:45.354 --> 26:46.687
where Jen was extracted from.
- Okay.

26:46.755 --> 26:48.555
She was born with a
heart valve condition

26:48.623 --> 26:50.990
that required emergency surgery.

26:51.058 --> 26:51.991
Those symptoms
would have presented

26:52.059 --> 26:53.995
hours after
she was born.

26:54.062 --> 26:57.399
Now, a lot of cults don't allow
their members to see doctors

26:57.466 --> 26:59.134
or take modern
medicine.

26:59.202 --> 27:00.803
So if Jen was born
into a cult,

27:00.871 --> 27:02.237
her only chance
of survival

27:02.305 --> 27:04.239
would actually be
getting extracted.

27:04.307 --> 27:05.575
That's what I'm thinking,

27:05.643 --> 27:08.411
so I-I ran a search
on the list of known cults

27:08.479 --> 27:09.679
that prohibit
medical treatment.

27:09.747 --> 27:11.047
That is the
preliminary list.

27:11.115 --> 27:13.516
I'm cross-referencing it
right now with Porter's files

27:13.583 --> 27:14.850
to see if we can narrow it down
even further.

27:14.918 --> 27:18.020
That's excellent work,
that's great.

27:19.523 --> 27:21.725
Um, anything else?

27:21.793 --> 27:24.261
That's all I got, boss.

27:24.328 --> 27:26.930
Hey, hold up a sec.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.936
Is there, is there
anything else you want to,

27:32.003 --> 27:33.537
you want to talk
to me about?

27:35.574 --> 27:37.774
What do you mean?

27:37.842 --> 27:39.776
I mean,
you seem distracted.

27:39.844 --> 27:43.546
I want you to know that
if something is going on,

27:43.614 --> 27:45.048
you can come to me.

27:48.487 --> 27:51.421
Well, um...

27:51.489 --> 27:54.893
I didn't want to bother you
in the middle of a case,

27:54.961 --> 27:56.695
but...

27:56.763 --> 28:00.499
I received a phone call
yesterday from Langley.

28:00.567 --> 28:02.568
My old boss at the
CIA said he picked up

28:02.635 --> 28:05.904
on some chatter he thought
I should know about.

28:05.972 --> 28:07.306
What are you talking about?

28:09.975 --> 28:12.443
My fiancé might be alive.

28:14.479 --> 28:16.847
How accurate is this intel?

28:16.915 --> 28:21.785
They can't say, but I can't
stop thinking about it.

28:25.657 --> 28:28.225
Okay, uh,
when are you leaving?

28:30.261 --> 28:32.796
I was hoping as soon
as we found Jen.

28:34.265 --> 28:35.832
If there's any chance
he might be alive,

28:35.899 --> 28:37.099
Steve, I need to be there.

28:37.167 --> 28:40.235
Yes, you do, and if there's
anything that we can do,

28:40.303 --> 28:43.038
you, uh, you come
to us, okay?

28:45.842 --> 28:47.243
You're gonna want to hear this.

28:47.310 --> 28:49.112
Matt, it's Rhea.

28:49.180 --> 28:51.216
I know you said
it wasn't safe to contact you,

28:51.283 --> 28:52.785
but I need your help.

28:52.852 --> 28:54.319
I think my father knows
what happened.

28:54.387 --> 28:55.621
Jen's in danger.

28:55.688 --> 28:57.690
I need you to make sure
he doesn't get to her.

28:57.758 --> 28:59.792
So I ran that
private number

28:59.860 --> 29:01.527
the girl from the
diner gave us.

29:01.595 --> 29:02.762
Turns out it has a
voice mail account.

29:02.829 --> 29:03.863
This was the
only thing on it.

29:03.931 --> 29:05.464
Do we know who Rhea is?

29:05.532 --> 29:07.333
She could be the birth mother.
I'm running

29:07.401 --> 29:09.301
the name and cross-referencing
with everyone in Jen's life.

29:09.369 --> 29:10.670
Do we know
where the call originated?

29:10.738 --> 29:11.938
Came from an unlisted number
on Lanai

29:12.006 --> 29:13.473
a couple
of days ago.

29:13.541 --> 29:16.476
Wait, uh, there's a commune
on Lanai that's been red-flagged

29:16.544 --> 29:17.744
by several
government agencies.

29:17.811 --> 29:19.112
They're the only ones
on that island.

29:19.179 --> 29:21.215
That's got to be where Jen is.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.615
<i>About 20 years ago</i>
<i>they bought an old plantation</i>

29:54.682 --> 29:56.083
<i>at the end of the Kaena Trail.</i>

29:56.150 --> 29:57.031
Who runs it?

29:57.056 --> 29:58.256
<i>Haole</i> by the name
of Steven Carver.

29:58.319 --> 29:59.386
This Steven Carver?

29:59.453 --> 30:01.855
Yep, that's our island's
Jim Jones.

30:01.922 --> 30:03.357
Nice.

30:03.424 --> 30:04.725
How many people
drinking his punch?

30:04.792 --> 30:06.259
Carver started with
about two families.

30:06.327 --> 30:08.161
Now he's got about 50 people

30:08.229 --> 30:11.198
on that property,
mostly militia types,

30:11.266 --> 30:13.367
isolationists living
off the grid,

30:13.435 --> 30:15.402
thinking modern-day society
and all its trappings

30:15.470 --> 30:17.805
is the work of the Devil.

30:17.872 --> 30:19.239
This island is not only
their home,

30:19.307 --> 30:20.574
it's their
Garden of Eden.

30:20.642 --> 30:21.842
They'll do anything
to protect it.

30:21.910 --> 30:23.110
I assume they're armed.

30:23.178 --> 30:24.611
I wouldn't bet against it,

30:24.679 --> 30:26.980
but I know someone who's been
on the other side of those walls

30:27.048 --> 30:29.116
who might be able to give you
a better picture.

30:31.252 --> 30:33.787
<i>Yeah, I've been in there.</i>

30:33.855 --> 30:36.123
It's barely living.

30:36.191 --> 30:37.925
Carver's got them thinking

30:37.992 --> 30:38.926
it's paradise.

30:38.993 --> 30:40.094
Do you know
if one of his followers

30:40.161 --> 30:41.095
is a woman named Rhea?

30:41.162 --> 30:43.764
Yeah, she's
Carver's daughter.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.568
Okay, please, if you can, when
was the last time you saw her?

30:48.636 --> 30:50.937
Oh, a couple days ago.

30:51.005 --> 30:52.239
She came in
to use the phone.

30:52.306 --> 30:53.940
Okay, uh, is this her?

30:54.008 --> 30:56.810
Yeah, it's an old one,
but that's Rhea.

30:56.877 --> 30:59.079
Okay, so Carver's been the one
exchanging the e-mails with Jen.

30:59.146 --> 31:00.614
He wasn't lying;
this is her birth mother.

31:00.681 --> 31:03.049
That makes Carver
Jen's grandfather.

31:03.117 --> 31:04.451
Does Carver have
weapons up there?

31:04.519 --> 31:06.620
He has rifles,
uses 'em to hunt.

31:06.687 --> 31:07.687
Okay, I'm gonna need you

31:07.755 --> 31:09.155
to draw me a map
of that compound.

31:09.223 --> 31:10.924
Sure, absolutely.

31:10.991 --> 31:13.793
Uh, can I help you?

31:15.796 --> 31:16.963
- He one of them?
- Yeah.

31:17.030 --> 31:18.631
Danny.
Okay, he made us.

31:18.632 --> 31:19.522
Wait, whoa.

31:19.547 --> 31:21.080
Listen, he's gonna
go back to the compound,

31:21.168 --> 31:22.483
<i>tell Carver we're here,</i>
<i>Carver's going to run.</i>

31:22.484 --> 31:23.515
What's the fastest
way up there?

31:23.540 --> 31:24.939
There's only
one road in.

31:25.206 --> 31:26.440
Unless...

31:26.508 --> 31:28.140
Unless what?

31:29.909 --> 31:31.843
This is the only way in--
on an animal?

31:31.911 --> 31:33.111
We couldn't have got
an ATV

31:33.179 --> 31:34.603
or a golf cart or something like...?

31:34.628 --> 31:35.691
- Did you say ATV?
- I did.

31:35.692 --> 31:37.848
They wouldn't hear an ATV from
a mile away, would they, Danny?

31:37.851 --> 31:40.353
But you know what? Your whining
is probably louder than an ATV.

31:40.421 --> 31:41.354
Whining?

31:41.422 --> 31:42.422
Yeah, you're whining.

31:42.490 --> 31:43.957
How long have
you two been married?

31:45.693 --> 31:47.628
- Horses.
- Whoa,

31:47.695 --> 31:51.198
whoa, whoa, that's it,
that's it right there.

32:10.382 --> 32:11.883
What are you doing?

32:13.218 --> 32:16.020
I told you
to keep away from here.

32:16.088 --> 32:18.723
She's, she's not well.

32:18.791 --> 32:20.358
That's none of your business.

32:20.426 --> 32:23.828
It is my business--
she's my daughter.

32:23.896 --> 32:27.031
And she's my granddaughter
and you told me she was dead.

32:28.366 --> 32:29.900
You threw her away
like trash.

32:31.469 --> 32:32.937
Go on, go to your room.

32:33.004 --> 32:34.438
I'll deal with you later.

32:46.384 --> 32:48.485
Here.

32:48.553 --> 32:49.486
Uh, drink this.

32:49.553 --> 32:50.887
There's herbs
in here.

32:50.954 --> 32:52.521
It's good for your heart.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.358
I don't want your tea.

32:56.426 --> 32:57.726
I just want to go home.

32:57.794 --> 32:58.727
Please.

32:58.795 --> 33:00.596
This is your home.

33:03.300 --> 33:06.201
I know this is hard
for you to understand,

33:06.269 --> 33:09.337
but this is my fault.

33:09.405 --> 33:12.407
I-I didn't raise
your mother right.

33:12.475 --> 33:15.677
But I'm not gonna make
that same mistake with you.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.578
You're my family.

33:17.646 --> 33:19.013
I'm not gonna let them

33:19.081 --> 33:20.081
take you
away from me.

33:20.149 --> 33:21.182
You're not my family!

33:21.250 --> 33:22.584
Now, listen
to me. Listen.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.587
Those people...

33:25.655 --> 33:27.689
are the ones that have been
poisoning you.

33:27.757 --> 33:29.959
Now, I can make
you better.

33:31.962 --> 33:33.729
You have to trust me.

33:36.133 --> 33:39.201
Just drink your tea.

33:40.937 --> 33:43.272
We've got a problem.

33:53.883 --> 33:55.317
All right.

33:55.384 --> 33:57.653
According to this,
Carver's cabin is right in

33:57.720 --> 33:58.919
the middle
of the compound, okay?

33:58.987 --> 34:00.154
If Jen is here, that's where

34:00.222 --> 34:01.289
he's gonna be holding her.

34:01.356 --> 34:02.456
Wait, I think that's her.

34:06.728 --> 34:07.862
Come on, we got to move.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.739
Down on your knees. Now.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.141
Face down, face down.
Hands behind your back.

34:20.208 --> 34:21.275
It's okay.

34:21.344 --> 34:22.310
Get them inside.

34:22.378 --> 34:23.612
Jen, we're not
gonna hurt you.

34:23.679 --> 34:24.813
We're the police.
We're Five-O.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.880
Get down.

34:25.949 --> 34:27.949
It's okay.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.020
Where's Jen?

34:32.088 --> 34:33.621
- I don't know.
- What do you mean,

34:33.690 --> 34:34.590
you don't know?

34:34.657 --> 34:35.591
My father found out

34:35.658 --> 34:37.025
you were coming,
and he took her.

34:41.458 --> 34:43.359
We got company.

34:45.862 --> 34:47.130
Everybody down!

34:52.534 --> 34:53.467
Whoa! Please.

34:53.536 --> 34:55.469
Can we try
not to kill

34:55.538 --> 34:57.438
everybody in the
compound, okay?

34:57.506 --> 34:58.706
One of these hippies might know

34:58.774 --> 35:00.008
where Jen is, all right?
Fine.

35:01.443 --> 35:03.511
One, two, three!

35:08.551 --> 35:09.952
What'd I tell you?!
Go, go, go, go!

35:10.019 --> 35:11.520
Stay here and stay down.

35:24.067 --> 35:25.000
Down!

35:32.377 --> 35:33.844
Drop it.

35:47.291 --> 35:48.425
Where's Jen?

35:51.896 --> 35:53.196
Where did Carver take her?

35:53.264 --> 35:54.698
Don't make me
ask you again.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.735
He has a plane.

35:57.802 --> 35:58.669
Where?

35:58.737 --> 36:00.104
Where is the plane?

36:02.141 --> 36:03.975
Two miles west of here.

36:04.042 --> 36:05.710
But you'll never catch him.

Jen.

38:02.188 --> 38:04.656
Jen, you hear me?

38:04.723 --> 38:05.890
Everything's gonna be okay,
all right?

38:05.958 --> 38:07.326
We're gonna get you
back to your parents.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.663
Okay?

38:23.110 --> 38:25.211
I knew as soon as

38:25.279 --> 38:27.847
Jen was born
that something was wrong.

38:29.884 --> 38:31.818
She needed
medical treatment.

38:31.886 --> 38:35.655
With real doctors.

38:35.723 --> 38:38.691
But my father
would never allow it.

38:38.759 --> 38:40.193
He said,

38:40.261 --> 38:42.361
"Medicine makes us weak.

38:42.429 --> 38:45.898
We have to empower our bodies
to fight."

38:45.966 --> 38:48.968
But her little body--
it just...

38:54.208 --> 38:58.945
It just didn't have
anything to fight with.

39:00.981 --> 39:04.417
I-I knew we were
losing her.

39:04.485 --> 39:06.485
So that's why you
gave her away?

39:08.488 --> 39:14.095
The only way to save her life
was to let her go.

39:15.597 --> 39:17.731
So I faked her death.

39:17.799 --> 39:20.733
But a few weeks ago,

39:20.801 --> 39:24.737
my father was in town
and saw a magazine article

39:24.805 --> 39:30.174
about this amazing girl
with a heart condition...

39:32.177 --> 39:35.779
...and he just knew it was Jen.

39:37.650 --> 39:39.717
Hmm. So you
called Porter.

39:41.386 --> 39:45.121
I tried to warn him
that my father was coming.

39:45.189 --> 39:47.656
And he said
he'd take care of it.

39:47.724 --> 39:51.126
And...

39:51.194 --> 39:53.094
now he's dead because of me.

39:53.162 --> 39:54.395
No.

39:54.463 --> 39:56.397
You were looking after Jen.

39:56.465 --> 40:00.000
You did what any mother would
do to protect their child.

40:02.036 --> 40:05.738
She's not my child.

40:05.806 --> 40:08.408
The Hassleys raised her.

40:08.476 --> 40:12.612
And I'm just thankful
for everything they've done.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.782

The governor wants to make it

42:20.474 --> 42:22.742
a zero-tolerance policy with
regard to crime and corruption.

42:22.810 --> 42:25.879
He's tasked me with
cleaning up this department,

42:25.946 --> 42:29.182
which is exactly
what I am going to do.

42:30.685 --> 42:32.352
Starting with your cousin.

42:36.858 --> 42:40.460
After a lengthy investigation by
the Internal Affairs Department,

42:40.528 --> 42:42.896
Officer Kono Kalakaua has been

with charges.
