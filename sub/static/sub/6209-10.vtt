WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.497
It's not funny, Salem.

00:06.297 --> 00:07.329
Morning.

00:09.842 --> 00:11.253
Why did Salem startle me?

00:11.426 --> 00:13.669
It's Friday the 13th,
the day that black witch-cats

00:13.845 --> 00:16.846
have the power to scare
the living daylights out of people.

00:17.014 --> 00:18.509
You should've seen your face.

00:18.682 --> 00:22.301
I gotta stop laughing
or milk's gonna come out of my nose.

00:22.477 --> 00:24.186
Here comes Hilda. Act normal.

00:24.354 --> 00:25.730
Good morning, Hilda.

00:28.815 --> 00:32.979
Oh, happy Friday the 13th, Salem.

00:33.152 --> 00:35.027
Aunt Hilda, a bat just
flew out of your mouth.

00:35.196 --> 00:37.272
Oh, how embarrassing.
I have bat breath again.

00:37.447 --> 00:38.942
Have you been eating
pomegranates?

00:39.115 --> 00:43.694
I know they don't agree with me,
but I had a craving for crimson pulp.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.448
Is it bad?

00:47.914 --> 00:50.204
Look, a tour group.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.014 --> 01:12.134
I have to update my wardrobe.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.068
Great. Can we get this quiz over with?
I have to get to school.

01:24.235 --> 01:28.233
There's no quiz. I just came by
to tell you it's Friday the 13th.

01:28.405 --> 01:29.568
I already told her.

01:31.366 --> 01:34.071
I might not even take a nap today.

01:34.243 --> 01:35.786
There's more to Friday the 13th

01:35.953 --> 01:38.740
than black cats
with a sorry sense of humour.

01:39.289 --> 01:41.282
To learn more, read about it.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.078
Like I have time for this.

01:44.251 --> 01:48.830
"Eleventh hour, 12th of never,
13th, Friday the."

01:49.005 --> 01:50.998
What? I can do that?

01:51.507 --> 01:53.001
Why didn't you guys tell me

01:53.175 --> 01:55.963
that on Friday the 13th
I can tell a mortal I'm a witch?

01:56.136 --> 01:59.469
Oh. The one where you can tell anyone
and they can know for 24 hours?

01:59.638 --> 02:01.679
- Yes.
- We didn't want you to know.

02:01.849 --> 02:03.391
Well, I learned it on the streets.

02:03.558 --> 02:06.015
- Who should I tell, Harvey or Valerie?
- Oh, Sabrina.

02:06.186 --> 02:08.592
Telling mortals is a very bad idea.

02:10.021 --> 02:11.932
But I wanna come out
of the linen closet.

02:12.107 --> 02:14.775
We felt the same way
when we were your age,

02:14.942 --> 02:16.901
but you think you know someone...

02:17.069 --> 02:20.070
This is a secret
that's hard for mortals to accept.

02:20.238 --> 02:23.987
When I was younger,
I was dating a doctor.

02:24.158 --> 02:26.033
You've probably heard of him.

02:29.204 --> 02:31.363
My little apple strudel.

02:31.539 --> 02:33.117
Oh, Sigmund.

02:33.290 --> 02:35.580
Are you ready for the opera,
my dear?

02:35.751 --> 02:39.167
Yes. But first, there's something
that I must tell you.

02:39.337 --> 02:42.422
Ah. Something about your childhood?

02:42.590 --> 02:44.132
You hate your mother, don't you?

02:44.299 --> 02:46.293
- No.
- Really? I hate your mother.

02:47.219 --> 02:48.499
Today is Friday the 13th,

02:48.677 --> 02:51.216
and there's something that
I get to share with you.

02:51.388 --> 02:54.508
Sigmund, my darling, I'm a witch.

02:54.682 --> 02:57.388
Oh, well, you can be a little testy.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.636
No, no. I have real magical powers.

02:59.853 --> 03:00.969
Uh-huh.

03:01.146 --> 03:04.681
Can you show me
these magical powers?

03:04.857 --> 03:09.235
Well, you remember
that pocket watch that you admired?

03:10.320 --> 03:11.815
For you, Siggy.

03:11.988 --> 03:15.357
Get out of here.

03:15.533 --> 03:18.072
Witch. Witch.

03:18.244 --> 03:20.035
Take her out of here.

03:21.287 --> 03:22.831
We can make it work.

03:22.997 --> 03:24.540
This didn't happen.

03:24.706 --> 03:26.617
It was bad knackwurst.

03:26.792 --> 03:27.824
<i>Ja,</i> that's right.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.170
Once I got loose, I tripped him.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.875
You might say it was
the first Freudian slip.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.255
Guys overreact.
You should've told a girlfriend.

03:36.424 --> 03:39.342
I did.
I told my good friend Gwendolyn.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.465
We were out shopping,
and everything was going well...

03:43.597 --> 03:44.712
This is some joy.

03:44.889 --> 03:47.642
- Why didn't thou tell me sooner?
- Well.

03:48.101 --> 03:50.971
Make yon man's breeches rip.

03:55.731 --> 03:57.559
Gwendolyn was a lot of fun,

03:57.733 --> 03:59.192
but what a blabbermouth.

03:59.359 --> 04:02.527
She told everyone she knew,
and then some.

04:03.822 --> 04:05.400
Forsooth, 'tis true.

04:05.573 --> 04:07.815
Zelda's a witch.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.035
<i>They didn't take it very well.</i>

04:12.203 --> 04:15.323
She made the crops fail. It's her.

04:15.497 --> 04:18.416
<i>And then things really got ugly.</i>

04:18.584 --> 04:23.044
Dunk the witch! Dunk the witch!

04:27.090 --> 04:29.463
To this day
I don't care for swimming.

04:29.633 --> 04:31.508
Yeah, but by midnight,
mortals don't remember.

04:31.677 --> 04:33.920
So even if they hate you,
the next day it's over.

04:34.096 --> 04:36.005
They don't remember,
but you remember.

04:36.181 --> 04:38.139
Think long and hard about this,
Sabrina.

04:38.308 --> 04:42.851
If you tell someone, you may never feel
the same way about that person again.

04:43.312 --> 04:45.020
Well, this was uplifting.

04:45.188 --> 04:47.596
Thanks. I'll think about it.

04:50.066 --> 04:51.610
Just spooked a bread truck.

04:51.777 --> 04:54.019
The street is full of buns.

04:59.658 --> 05:01.698
- Hi, Libby.
- Ew.

05:03.578 --> 05:04.990
Why doesn't she like me?

05:05.162 --> 05:07.736
I'm thinking it's a thyroid problem.

05:07.915 --> 05:10.287
- Why do you care?
- Because I'd love to be popular.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.001
You know,
to have everyone respect me.

05:12.835 --> 05:15.326
- Bye, Libby.
- I just ate.

05:17.088 --> 05:20.458
- Any plans for your free period?
- Just my usual doodlefest.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.757
You think you can help me
study for my Spanish test?

05:22.927 --> 05:26.093
I have it after Study Hall,
and if I don't get at least a B, I'm toast.

05:26.262 --> 05:27.378
Sure.

05:29.098 --> 05:30.641
- What?
- I will help you.

05:31.308 --> 05:32.934
I could live with a C.

05:33.101 --> 05:34.134
Excuse me.

05:35.812 --> 05:37.852
Somebody didn't eat
their vegetables.

05:38.022 --> 05:39.683
What are you doing?
You look ridiculous.

05:39.857 --> 05:41.767
State law says
I have to wear a hairnet.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.066
Come on.

05:44.236 --> 05:46.193
It's time for a test of your endurance.

05:46.362 --> 05:48.521
We're off to Alaska for the Iditarod.

05:48.697 --> 05:50.109
Oh, but what about...

05:50.282 --> 05:52.489
<i>... Valerie?</i>

05:52.659 --> 05:53.940
Sabrina?

05:54.119 --> 05:55.827
Sabrina?

05:55.994 --> 05:57.027
Where did she go?

05:57.663 --> 05:59.822
A nerd ditched by a freak.

05:59.998 --> 06:01.908
It's like a movie of the week.

06:04.085 --> 06:06.872
Now, say goodbye to bat breath.

06:07.045 --> 06:09.418
Oh, I hope it works.

06:12.424 --> 06:15.959
Oh, great.
Now I have bass breath.

06:16.136 --> 06:19.339
Still think I'm on the right track.

06:21.223 --> 06:22.387
You passed.

06:22.558 --> 06:24.516
Now get to class. Mush.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.096
Oh, I missed Social Studies.

06:26.269 --> 06:27.301
You had a substitute.

06:27.478 --> 06:30.480
He spent the entire day
trying to open his desk drawer.

06:30.648 --> 06:32.688
But here's your homework.

06:32.858 --> 06:36.986
Great. I had an easy class,
and I smell like blubber.

06:38.529 --> 06:39.905
Valerie. Valerie.

06:40.072 --> 06:41.864
Valerie, I'm so sorry I took off like that.

06:42.031 --> 06:43.443
I failed my Spanish test.

06:43.616 --> 06:45.990
At least I think F means
the same thing in both languages.

06:46.161 --> 06:48.616
- I'm so incredibly sorry.
- I thought you were my friend.

06:49.163 --> 06:50.907
- Just forget it.
- Valerie, wait.

06:52.039 --> 06:53.700
There's something I need to tell you.

06:57.961 --> 07:00.085
You're my best friend
and I've been lying to you.

07:00.922 --> 07:02.749
I wanted to tell you
the biggest secret,

07:02.923 --> 07:06.672
and then maybe you'll understand
why I've disappeared in the cafeteria

07:06.843 --> 07:09.086
and been acting strange
pretty much all the time.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.710
I'm a witch.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.048
I knew you could be
a little grumpy sometimes, but--

07:14.224 --> 07:16.348
No. I have magical powers.

07:17.018 --> 07:19.640
Right. Well, can you show me
some magic?

07:20.354 --> 07:22.098
You know that sweater
you've always wanted?

07:26.984 --> 07:29.144
Get out...

07:32.280 --> 07:34.024
...of here. This is so cool.

07:34.199 --> 07:37.069
Well, it's so cool
that you think it's so cool.

07:37.242 --> 07:39.948
And you have no desire whatsoever
to have me committed?

07:40.120 --> 07:42.825
No. But I do have a few questions.

07:44.207 --> 07:45.832
That whole pointed-hat,
wart-on-the-nose thing?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.032
Pure Hollywood.

07:47.209 --> 07:48.787
You don't cook potions
in a cauldron?

07:48.960 --> 07:51.250
- Now that one we do.
- This is amazing.

07:51.421 --> 07:53.710
So you just point at stuff,
and stuff happens?

07:53.881 --> 07:55.507
That's the technical definition of it.

07:55.674 --> 07:57.963
- Well, can we point at stuff now?
- You bet.

07:58.134 --> 07:59.214
Shh.

08:02.347 --> 08:03.889
Isn't he that weird lunch lady?

08:04.056 --> 08:06.133
Valerie, I'd like you to meet
my quizmaster.

08:06.308 --> 08:08.182
Isn't this great?
I can show her all my magic.

08:08.351 --> 08:09.383
Well, not all your magic.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.514
You need a ticket for each time
you use magic with a mortal.

08:12.687 --> 08:13.969
This one's for the sweater.

08:14.147 --> 08:15.180
Why do I need tickets?

08:15.357 --> 08:19.437
Mortals don't have a lot of restraint
when it comes to magic...

08:19.610 --> 08:21.022
...or firearms.

08:22.238 --> 08:23.269
Quiz you later.

08:23.446 --> 08:26.614
Hey. Pop out the way you popped in,
with all that lightning-and-smoke stuff.

08:26.783 --> 08:27.898
See what I mean?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.993
I blame television.

08:31.161 --> 08:32.703
It's pointing time.

09:12.153 --> 09:13.647
I've discovered the cure.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.101
Eureka.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.779
It's all in this little tablet.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.192
Just give it to me.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.529
Testing, one, two, three.

09:27.457 --> 09:28.951
Yes. It worked.

09:29.124 --> 09:31.581
- Thanks, sister.
- I'm not just your sister.

09:32.169 --> 09:33.545
I'm a genius.

09:33.711 --> 09:35.087
I can end hunger.

09:35.254 --> 09:37.461
I can save the world.

09:37.631 --> 09:40.122
Oh, for crying out loud,
it's a breath mint.

09:40.759 --> 09:43.878
Oh, no. Señora Martinez.
I'd almost forgotten about my F.

09:44.053 --> 09:46.176
<i>Hola,</i> Valerie. That means "hello."

09:46.346 --> 09:47.676
<i>Hola.</i>

09:51.726 --> 09:53.720
Señora Martinez?

10:04.736 --> 10:07.192
Of course I'll give you
a second exam.

10:07.363 --> 10:08.740
You've obviously been studying.

10:10.741 --> 10:12.153
I love magic.

10:12.326 --> 10:14.318
There's Harvey.
You've gotta tell him about this.

10:14.494 --> 10:15.870
No, no, wait. Valerie.

10:16.370 --> 10:18.411
Sabrina's a witch.

10:25.961 --> 10:27.587
Valerie told me your secret.

10:27.755 --> 10:29.712
Yeah. It's true.

10:30.423 --> 10:31.455
Not really.

10:32.050 --> 10:33.925
Yeah. Here.
Have some baseball cleats.

10:34.385 --> 10:35.584
Whoa!

10:36.553 --> 10:37.586
I'm a witch.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.219
- Can we talk about this?
- Sure.

10:43.684 --> 10:44.716
A witch?

10:45.268 --> 10:48.970
So "freak" was an understatement.

10:54.068 --> 10:55.776
So, what is this Other Realm?

10:55.944 --> 10:57.984
Little place we call the witchy city.

10:59.738 --> 11:00.984
Salem talks?

11:01.156 --> 11:02.984
And I have a pretty good
singing voice.

11:03.158 --> 11:05.115
And he stops.

11:05.284 --> 11:07.077
Okay. We're off to the Other Realm.

11:07.245 --> 11:09.452
Sabrina, you're walking into a closet.

11:09.622 --> 11:12.196
After all you've seen today,
this seems weird? Come on.

11:17.253 --> 11:18.416
It's still a closet.

11:18.587 --> 11:19.833
Will you wait?

11:33.057 --> 11:36.011
- Wow.
- So, what do we do here?

11:36.184 --> 11:38.759
Same thing we do in the mortal realm:
hang out.

11:39.771 --> 11:41.930
Balloon. Buy your mortal a balloon.

11:42.106 --> 11:43.305
I'll take two.

11:45.942 --> 11:46.974
I know.

11:47.152 --> 11:49.441
I have tomato sauce on my tie.

11:49.612 --> 11:51.652
So, what magic does the balloon do?

11:52.114 --> 11:53.526
Nothing.

11:54.074 --> 11:56.031
Sucker.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.945
Carney workers.

11:58.119 --> 12:00.990
Hey, I could use some sunglasses.

12:02.247 --> 12:03.279
Wow.

12:05.666 --> 12:07.411
These are awesome.
You should get some.

12:07.585 --> 12:09.911
I have a whole drawer full
of virtual-reality sunglasses.

12:11.171 --> 12:12.666
Wow, that's amazing.

12:12.839 --> 12:14.631
You can look dorky in this realm too.

12:16.508 --> 12:17.968
Of course it's true.

12:18.135 --> 12:20.757
I heard it with my own ears
and have seen it with my own eyes.

12:20.928 --> 12:22.424
Sabrina's a witch.

12:24.057 --> 12:25.848
Okay, okay.

12:26.016 --> 12:30.180
The next step is to decide
how to use this piece of information.

12:30.354 --> 12:32.845
How can this help me?

12:33.022 --> 12:34.351
Thanks for the cure, Zeldy.

12:34.523 --> 12:36.563
Now I can enjoy
pomegranate pudding,

12:36.733 --> 12:38.691
pomegranate compote,
pomegranate pie.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.735
I like pomegranates.

12:40.904 --> 12:42.695
This is what it's all about for me.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.940
Enabling you to eat too much fruit.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.445
A message from the Other Realm.

12:48.618 --> 12:50.576
I hope it didn't ruin
my pomegranate toast.

12:50.745 --> 12:53.117
It's from Elixir Pharmaceuticals.

12:53.288 --> 12:54.570
They heard about my discovery.

12:54.748 --> 12:57.619
They want me to come do
a demonstration with my subject.

12:57.792 --> 12:58.872
Me. Take me.

12:59.043 --> 13:01.960
A whole other realm
of people to scare?

13:02.128 --> 13:03.161
Yeah, take him.

13:03.338 --> 13:06.505
There's no way I'm going to humiliate
myself in front of a bunch of eggheads.

13:06.673 --> 13:09.166
Fine. Then no more cure.

13:09.343 --> 13:11.466
And that means
no more pomegranates.

13:11.636 --> 13:13.261
Egghead.

13:58.090 --> 14:00.048
Okay. We only have two tickets left.

14:00.217 --> 14:02.542
So for the grand finale,
you each get to make a last wish.

14:02.719 --> 14:04.796
- I wanna meet Mark Langston.
- Who?

14:04.971 --> 14:06.680
Mark Langston. My favourite pitcher.

14:06.848 --> 14:09.765
Four all-star games,
and he can really bring the heat.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.851
Well, I'm assuming since
it's your last wish, that's a good thing.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.893
I saw him the day
he no-hit the Mariners.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.226
Harvey.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.059
- Hey, how's it going, man?
- Pretty good.

14:21.234 --> 14:22.894
- How about warming me up?
- Sure.

14:23.527 --> 14:26.612
Please don't let this be a dream.

14:32.118 --> 14:33.612
Oh, this is great.

14:33.785 --> 14:37.783
Mark Langston just broke
all my fingers.

14:40.666 --> 14:41.698
I know what I want.

14:41.876 --> 14:43.584
Say Mark Langston,
we could save a ticket.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.033
No. My guy's funny,

14:45.211 --> 14:47.620
he can really move and he's so cute.

14:47.796 --> 14:49.837
The Dalai Lama can dance?

14:50.007 --> 14:51.039
Drew Carey.

14:51.216 --> 14:52.794
I wanna dance with Drew Carey.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.556
Thanks for the dance, Valerie.

15:51.723 --> 15:53.597
This is the best moment of my life.

15:53.766 --> 15:55.261
Gee, I wish I had a rose to give you.

15:55.434 --> 15:57.511
Oh, I know. Here.

15:57.687 --> 15:58.718
Have these.

15:58.895 --> 16:00.225
Hope you're nearsighted.

16:03.941 --> 16:04.973
Was it fun?

16:05.985 --> 16:07.978
I'm never taking these off.

16:09.737 --> 16:12.360
Man, he's blind.

16:12.532 --> 16:14.774
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:14.950 --> 16:17.703
- And you saw it with your own eyes?
- That's right.

16:17.869 --> 16:21.285
Your children are going to school
with a proven witch.

16:21.664 --> 16:24.285
- Oh, we've gotta get her out.
- Exactly.

16:24.457 --> 16:26.285
But first things first.

16:26.459 --> 16:28.619
I get anything good in her locker.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.293
Now that the pomegranate
has been administered,

16:32.464 --> 16:35.418
observe what happens
when Subject A speaks.

16:35.591 --> 16:37.135
Subject A has a name.

16:39.803 --> 16:41.464
Now open your mouth wide,

16:41.638 --> 16:44.047
so that they can see
the severity of your condition.

16:44.224 --> 16:45.683
Oh, good. I'm late.

16:47.435 --> 16:50.851
Hey.
Let's take a look inside your mouths.

16:53.189 --> 16:56.274
Did you see?
Mark Langston signed my bruise.

16:56.442 --> 16:59.147
You're gonna have to describe it to me,
because I can't see a...

16:59.320 --> 17:01.028
- ...thing!
- Valerie!

17:01.237 --> 17:03.147
- Aah!
- Harvey! Oh, no.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.647
Not a swirling vortex.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.445
Take it easy.
Everything's gonna be okay.

17:08.617 --> 17:10.444
Don't panic.

17:10.618 --> 17:12.244
This is bad. This is very bad.

17:12.413 --> 17:14.241
Hey, help me.
My friends are swirling.

17:14.415 --> 17:16.787
- Why don't you just zap them out?
- I'm out of tickets.

17:17.459 --> 17:18.835
I guess you lost your head.

17:19.002 --> 17:20.377
My findings suggested

17:20.544 --> 17:22.834
that if I took two parts boric acid

17:23.005 --> 17:25.757
and combined it
with the shells of dung beetles...

17:25.923 --> 17:28.462
You said those were raisins.

17:29.844 --> 17:32.679
What a snore.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.803
I need a little fresh air and a latte.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.933
Come see the mortals in a vortex.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.063
Only two tickets.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.900
Reach for my hand!

17:48.776 --> 17:52.476
Why didn't I listen? Harvey and Valerie
are gonna be sucked into oblivion,

17:52.654 --> 17:55.193
and if they come out alive,
they're gonna think I'm a monster.

17:55.364 --> 17:57.441
Come on, oblivion.

17:57.616 --> 18:00.072
- You've got tickets. Give me tickets.
- No. They're mine.

18:00.243 --> 18:02.699
- Come on, you headless goon.
- Yo, Sabrina.

18:02.870 --> 18:04.780
- I just had 20 lattes.
- Black cat.

18:09.042 --> 18:11.877
Stop the vortex.

18:13.337 --> 18:15.461
Are you guys okay?

18:15.630 --> 18:17.588
I'm fine!

18:17.757 --> 18:19.632
Yeah, yeah, thanks for the tickets.

18:25.597 --> 18:26.628
You guys hate me?

18:26.806 --> 18:30.342
No. And I'm beginning to understand
why Scotsmen wear kilts.

18:30.518 --> 18:32.060
Nice and breezy.

18:33.144 --> 18:35.221
We've gotta get a picture of this.

18:36.647 --> 18:38.272
Do one nice thing today?

18:38.440 --> 18:39.473
Oh, all right.

18:39.650 --> 18:42.022
But I have to warn you,
I tend to cut people's heads off.

18:46.405 --> 18:49.157
Oh, I forgot. Here's your sleeve.

18:49.324 --> 18:52.361
Wow, you guys were near death and
you still managed to save my sleeve.

18:52.535 --> 18:55.869
- Near death?
- Anyway, thanks for everything.

18:56.037 --> 18:58.707
Being a witch is so much more fun
when you can tell your friends.

18:58.873 --> 19:03.002
You're so lucky. The only secret I have
is that I'm allergic to watermelon.

19:03.168 --> 19:04.201
Well, that's out.

19:06.337 --> 19:07.370
There's the witch.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.007
Is it true you have magical powers?

19:09.173 --> 19:11.132
Don't ask her.
She won't admit to anything.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.210
Ask them.
They'll corroborate my story.

19:13.385 --> 19:14.417
What's this all about?

19:14.594 --> 19:16.671
Come on, Harvey.
I've got a book deal in the works

19:16.846 --> 19:19.254
and a piece of it could be yours.

19:19.432 --> 19:21.224
Libby, are you having
another episode?

19:21.391 --> 19:24.263
Forget him. He's been under her spell
since she first flew in.

19:24.436 --> 19:26.228
- Tell them, Valerie.
- No.

19:26.396 --> 19:27.559
You know it's the truth.

19:28.689 --> 19:31.146
If you back me up on this,
I won't forget about it.

19:31.317 --> 19:33.226
None of the popular girls will.

19:39.448 --> 19:41.903
I hate to do this, but...

19:42.074 --> 19:44.033
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:45.077 --> 19:47.746
You freaks are so infuriating.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.744
Looks like another
high-school prank.

19:50.915 --> 19:52.114
She is a witch.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.331
And an extraterrestrial.

19:54.501 --> 19:56.376
Look, do an alien autopsy.

19:57.837 --> 19:59.297
You guys.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.663
Wow, it's after midnight.

20:00.840 --> 20:03.508
My parents are gonna wonder
where I've been.

20:05.093 --> 20:06.209
Where have I been?

20:06.386 --> 20:08.296
Just hanging out.

20:11.641 --> 20:14.476
Oh, man. My hand is throbbing.

20:14.643 --> 20:16.435
I've got a little motion sickness.

20:16.603 --> 20:18.145
Did we break any laws?

20:18.312 --> 20:21.349
Not really. See you.

20:25.193 --> 20:27.021
What are you hiding?
Sneaky. What is it?

20:27.195 --> 20:30.860
Nothing. It's just a package
of Bat-breath Savers.

20:34.075 --> 20:35.356
How could you?

20:35.534 --> 20:36.946
Look at my hair.

20:37.119 --> 20:39.445
Well, at least you can eat
all the pomegranates you want.

20:39.621 --> 20:42.954
I'm sick of pomegranates.

20:43.958 --> 20:45.073
Hey, you still up?

20:45.250 --> 20:46.627
Yeah. So how was your day?

20:46.794 --> 20:50.163
Well, I told Valerie,
and Valerie told Harvey that I'm a witch.

20:50.338 --> 20:51.619
Oh, how did it go?

20:51.798 --> 20:52.912
Honey, are you okay?

20:53.090 --> 20:56.210
You were right. I'll never feel the same
way about Valerie or Harvey again.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.045
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:58.970 --> 21:01.094
I like them so much more.

21:04.599 --> 21:07.174
How come you have
better friends than we did?

21:09.728 --> 21:12.647
So no matter how many people
Libby told, they've all forgotten by now.

21:12.815 --> 21:15.306
- That's the way it works.
- Good.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.270
I wanted to make sure I wasn't
gonna be burned at the stake Monday.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.981
Oh, he had some Friday the 13th.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.148
Poor little guy wore himself out.

21:24.323 --> 21:26.400
Oh, he looks so peaceful.

21:26.575 --> 21:28.615
Should we?

21:32.247 --> 21:34.738
That's okay.
I have another eight lives.

21:34.915 --> 21:37.787
Seven after I fall down from here.
