00:00.064 --> 00:01.589
Previously
on "Devious Maids"...

00:01.624 --> 00:03.772
Your son supported himself
for the last two years

00:03.807 --> 00:05.284
by selling drugs.

00:05.319 --> 00:08.167
Eddie was doing some business
with some trust fund brats.

00:08.203 --> 00:09.544
There was this one kid.

00:09.579 --> 00:11.263
The second Eddie's back was
turned, Flora was all over him.

00:11.298 --> 00:12.459
He's over there.

00:12.494 --> 00:14.001
Remi Delatour?

00:14.036 --> 00:16.265
Phillipe Delatour,
what are you up to?

00:16.300 --> 00:18.847
I wish I had been a better
husband to you. Oh.

00:18.882 --> 00:20.985
Well, just know
you can trust me.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.113
I do trust you.

00:22.148 --> 00:23.318
So I want to introduce you
to someone.

00:23.352 --> 00:24.519
Carmen, I want you
to meet Scott...

00:24.537 --> 00:26.121
My boyfriend.

00:26.155 --> 00:28.490
I saw our reflection
in the glass,

00:28.524 --> 00:30.659
and we looked like
bad people.

00:30.693 --> 00:32.527
Rosie, don't you want
to be with me?

00:32.545 --> 00:33.912
You made a vow
to your wife.

00:33.963 --> 00:36.298
We can't go around
breaking the rules. It's bad.

00:36.332 --> 00:38.466
Taylor and I are going
to have a baby.

00:38.501 --> 00:40.535
Are you going to be okay?

00:40.553 --> 00:41.536
Oh, my God.

00:41.554 --> 00:44.222
Michael! Oh, no.

00:44.257 --> 00:46.641
Somebody get a knife!

00:46.676 --> 00:47.926
Please come back to me.

00:47.977 --> 00:49.895
Please come back to me,
baby.

00:49.929 --> 00:52.180
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

01:00.022 --> 01:01.656
You listen to me, Howard.

01:01.691 --> 01:04.860
My last movie grossed
over $300 million,

01:04.894 --> 01:08.613
which means I want back end.
Merchandising.

01:08.664 --> 01:10.899
Perks coming out of my ass.

01:10.917 --> 01:12.233
And if you can't
get this for me,

01:12.251 --> 01:14.235
I will find an agent who can!

01:14.253 --> 01:15.620
Do you get what I'm saying?

01:15.671 --> 01:17.455
You moronic squib?!

01:34.673 --> 01:36.791
Hey.
I just put the baby down.

01:36.825 --> 01:39.961
He's probably still awake
if you want to check on him.

01:41.663 --> 01:42.714
Mrs. Peri?

01:42.765 --> 01:44.632
Where's Spence?

01:44.666 --> 01:47.352
He left for New York this morning.

01:48.637 --> 01:51.055
Oh. Right.

01:51.106 --> 01:52.974
Are you okay?

01:53.008 --> 01:55.843
Oh, Rosie.

01:55.861 --> 01:59.480
Mrs. Peri, what is it?

01:59.514 --> 02:02.784
I was driving home...

02:02.818 --> 02:04.902
And this man just came
out of nowhere.

02:04.953 --> 02:07.688
And I tried to swerve,
but he was right in front of me.

02:07.706 --> 02:09.857
Are you saying
you hit someone?

02:09.875 --> 02:11.626
There was an accident.

02:11.660 --> 02:14.829
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

02:14.863 --> 02:17.382
What did
the paramedics say?

02:17.416 --> 02:20.034
- Paramedics?
- From the ambulance.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.421
Oh, my God.

02:23.472 --> 02:26.424
You didn't call
an ambulance?

02:26.475 --> 02:28.542
I panicked. I just had
to get out of there.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.178
So you didn't stop
to help him?

02:30.212 --> 02:33.181
I can't afford
a scandal right now!

02:33.215 --> 02:36.401
I'm in negotiations
with Paramount!

02:36.435 --> 02:38.552
Where did this happen?

02:38.570 --> 02:39.854
Mulholland.

02:39.888 --> 02:41.939
Just past Coldwater. Why?

02:41.990 --> 02:43.658
I have to go check on him.

02:43.692 --> 02:44.776
Okay.

02:44.827 --> 02:46.110
Okay, that's good.

02:46.161 --> 02:47.662
But don't tell him
about me.

02:47.696 --> 02:49.080
I won't.

02:49.114 --> 02:51.899
But I will have to
call 9-1-1.

02:51.917 --> 02:53.835
- Rosie?
- Hmm?

02:53.869 --> 02:55.787
What if he's dead?

02:55.838 --> 02:57.004
You better get down
on your knees

02:57.039 --> 02:58.122
and pray to God he's not.

03:01.841 --> 03:04.762
That was not a suggestion.

Devious Maids 1x10- Cleaning out the Closet

03:29.655 --> 03:30.988
Hey.

03:31.039 --> 03:32.156
What are you still
doing up?

03:32.207 --> 03:35.776
I wanted to show you
something.

03:35.794 --> 03:36.828
What's that?

03:36.879 --> 03:38.546
Dr. Kagan did
an ultrasound today.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.948
And I got to hear
the baby's heartbeat.

03:40.966 --> 03:44.168
Oh, well,
that's wonderful.

03:44.219 --> 03:47.138
I was so excited
to share this with you.

03:47.172 --> 03:50.925
But...
You didn't come home.

03:50.959 --> 03:53.478
I got caught up

03:53.512 --> 03:55.229
in the craziness
at the office. And...

03:55.264 --> 03:58.766
I know you went
to the hospital... again.

04:00.853 --> 04:03.070
Yes. I stopped to see her.

04:03.105 --> 04:06.524
Why do you keep doing that?

04:06.575 --> 04:08.743
Olivia tried to kill herself.
I feel responsible.

04:08.777 --> 04:11.579
It was a perverse grab
for attention.

04:11.613 --> 04:13.981
- Why give it to her?
- She's sick.

04:13.999 --> 04:17.651
She desperately needs
someone to care about her.

04:17.668 --> 04:19.454
I know how she feels.

04:19.488 --> 04:22.206
This is
a temporary situation.

04:22.257 --> 04:24.658
No. There have been
three people in this marriage

04:24.676 --> 04:26.043
from day one.

04:26.094 --> 04:30.131
And if you don't start making
a choice soon, I will.

04:37.806 --> 04:40.024
Marisol?

04:40.058 --> 04:43.945
Please, I need
to talk to somebody.

04:43.979 --> 04:47.148
Marisol?

05:04.199 --> 05:06.033
Why haven't we gone
to the D.A. Yet?

05:06.051 --> 05:07.535
We need a story to tell.

05:07.553 --> 05:10.871
Once upon a time,
Remi Delatour killed Flora.

05:10.889 --> 05:12.306
And when the D.A. asks why?

05:12.341 --> 05:14.208
He got her pregnant.

05:14.226 --> 05:15.843
She was gonna ruin
his life.

05:15.877 --> 05:17.645
Did Remi know
she was pregnant?

05:17.679 --> 05:19.263
If he didn't,
there's no motive.

05:19.314 --> 05:20.765
And without a motive,

05:20.816 --> 05:22.850
the D.A. will laugh us
out of his office.

05:22.884 --> 05:26.053
But if we prove
that Remi knew...

05:26.071 --> 05:30.741
Then we have enough evidence
to challenge the D.A.'s case.

05:32.694 --> 05:36.614
Is it ethical to trick someone
into incriminating themselves?

05:36.665 --> 05:38.749
The first thing they taught us
in law school

05:38.784 --> 05:43.170
was that "ethical" and "legal"
aren't the same thing.

05:43.205 --> 05:45.206
What's your idea?

05:52.747 --> 05:54.582
I'm just saying

05:54.600 --> 05:57.635
I'd rather not be
introduced as your friend.

05:57.686 --> 05:59.937
Why? I mean,
we are friends, aren't we?

05:59.972 --> 06:03.608
No. No, no. We are, uh,
we are boyfriends, A.J.

06:03.642 --> 06:06.193
There is
a very big difference.

06:06.228 --> 06:08.813
Look, I'm
a "macho Latin singer."

06:08.864 --> 06:11.399
If I come out,
my career is over.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.650
So I have to stay
in the closet

06:12.701 --> 06:14.902
while you release
another salsa album?

06:16.572 --> 06:18.706
I just want the people
that you care about

06:18.740 --> 06:21.626
to know how we feel
about each other.

06:24.796 --> 06:27.131
- Carmen?
- I'm sorry.

06:27.165 --> 06:28.749
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

06:28.783 --> 06:30.134
Oh, what are you doing
up so late?

06:30.168 --> 06:31.919
Odessa's still
in the hospital.

06:31.953 --> 06:34.722
So... look,
there's a lot to do.

06:34.756 --> 06:36.390
Well, I don't want to add
to your load,

06:36.425 --> 06:38.125
but Scott is gonna be
staying with us for a few days.

06:38.143 --> 06:40.011
My duplex
is being painted.

06:40.062 --> 06:42.396
Can you make breakfast for us
in the morning?

06:42.431 --> 06:45.066
Any chance you can
eat breakfast at noon?

06:45.100 --> 06:47.401
Well, all I really
need is some...

06:47.436 --> 06:50.154
Coffee.
Well, that I can handle.

06:50.188 --> 06:51.739
Why don't you go upstairs?

06:51.773 --> 06:54.241
I gotta grab a couple of shirts.
Yeah, sure.

06:54.276 --> 06:56.861
I'll see you
in the morning.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.031
Scott seems nice.

07:00.082 --> 07:01.032
Does he?

07:01.083 --> 07:02.366
Yeah.
Hmm.

07:02.417 --> 07:04.619
Is there a problem?

07:04.653 --> 07:07.204
Well, there won't be
in four days.

07:07.255 --> 07:10.007
Once Scott's duplex is done,
I'm gonna break up with him.

07:10.042 --> 07:11.959
Why?

07:11.993 --> 07:14.261
He's needy, pushy,
and controlling.

07:14.296 --> 07:16.297
And he has lousy taste
in music.

07:18.133 --> 07:21.686
My salsa album was amazing.

07:30.112 --> 07:31.696
Z-zoila!

07:31.730 --> 07:33.347
What are you doing here?

07:33.365 --> 07:35.149
I'm sorry.
I forgot my phone,

07:35.183 --> 07:38.202
and I got calls to make
in the morning.

07:38.236 --> 07:39.687
Do you want me to do that?

07:39.705 --> 07:42.039
No. I think I've got it.
Come on.

07:42.074 --> 07:43.074
It'll take me two seconds.

07:46.078 --> 07:48.045
Do you have someone here?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.998
Oh, my God.
Who is it?

07:51.032 --> 07:53.884
Zoila. Please, tell me you
didn't seduce the plumber again.

07:53.919 --> 07:54.669
You should go.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.420
'Cause you know he
charges for the time.

07:56.471 --> 07:58.038
I'm not entertaining
the plumber.

07:58.056 --> 07:59.340
Who's here?

07:59.374 --> 08:00.975
I don't wish
to discuss this.

08:01.009 --> 08:02.209
Hey, hon?

08:02.227 --> 08:04.428
I changed my mind.
Nix the chardonnay.

08:04.479 --> 08:07.064
Bring up a nice Merlot.

08:07.099 --> 08:09.850
Hey, Zoila.

08:12.270 --> 08:14.054
You're sleeping
with Phillipe?

08:14.072 --> 08:16.941
Yes.

08:16.992 --> 08:18.025
So...

08:18.059 --> 08:19.860
I don't care if you're

08:19.894 --> 08:23.197
having a roll in the hay
with your ex.

08:23.231 --> 08:26.117
That's all it is, right?

08:26.168 --> 08:28.369
Casual rolling?

08:28.403 --> 08:31.038
Can I have my wine?

08:31.072 --> 08:32.873
Fine.

08:32.907 --> 08:37.077
Phillipe and I have started
to see each other again.

08:37.095 --> 08:38.879
For how long?

08:38.913 --> 08:41.599
Since Remi came home
from rehab.

08:43.351 --> 08:45.720
Oh, please don't look at me
that way.

08:45.754 --> 08:49.106
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is my disgust showing?

08:49.141 --> 08:51.776
This is why I don't
share things with you.

08:51.810 --> 08:53.927
You are a big
ball of hostility.

08:53.945 --> 08:55.146
No...

08:55.197 --> 08:56.480
I am a dose of reality.

08:56.531 --> 08:58.482
You don't date
your ex-husband.

08:58.533 --> 09:01.268
You discuss your son
with him.

09:01.286 --> 09:03.954
You borrow money from him.
You spend christmas with him.

09:03.989 --> 09:07.541
What you don't do
is let that emotional con man

09:07.576 --> 09:10.377
put you in a position
where he can hurt you.

09:10.412 --> 09:13.330
That was a wonderful speech.

09:13.381 --> 09:16.417
And I can't argue
with any part of it.

09:16.451 --> 09:19.420
But your timing
is unfortunate.

09:19.454 --> 09:21.088
Why?

09:21.122 --> 09:25.926
I think I'm already
falling in love with him again.

09:33.351 --> 09:35.126
Hello?!

09:36.139 --> 09:37.471
Hello?!

09:39.357 --> 09:40.524
Help.

09:40.575 --> 09:41.826
Mister?

09:46.248 --> 09:47.531
Are you okay?

09:47.582 --> 09:50.367
Why do I jog?

09:50.418 --> 09:52.336
It's not good for me.

09:52.370 --> 09:55.122
My God! You're bleeding.

09:55.156 --> 09:56.540
Yeah.

09:56.591 --> 10:00.928
This is the part
when you call the ambulance.

10:00.962 --> 10:03.097
Yes, sir.

10:03.131 --> 10:06.267
Tell 'em to bring something
stronger than codeine.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.835
I was hooked in the '90s.

10:07.853 --> 10:11.171
It does nothing for me anymore.
Oh.

10:11.189 --> 10:12.273
Hello?

10:12.307 --> 10:14.441
Yes. There's this man...
He's hurt.

10:14.476 --> 10:16.694
It's a miracle I found him.

10:16.728 --> 10:19.146
No one told me where he was.
I just happened to be

10:19.180 --> 10:20.773
coming out of my car
at the right moment.

10:20.774 --> 10:22.366
- And then... oh, God.
- Give me the phone.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.069
- He was laying here.
- You wanna give me the phone?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.370
Okay.

10:28.206 --> 10:30.324
Hello? Okay.

10:30.358 --> 10:32.293
I'm in an embankment

10:32.327 --> 10:35.296
off Mulholland
1 mile west of Coldwater.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.581
I'm bleeding and got
several broken bones.

10:37.632 --> 10:39.333
Please hurry.

10:46.174 --> 10:48.008
Oh, what are you doing?

10:48.042 --> 10:50.344
I'm asking God
to keep you alive.

10:50.378 --> 10:52.146
Prayer?

10:52.180 --> 10:55.149
That always works.

10:55.183 --> 10:56.984
You don't believe in God?

10:57.018 --> 11:00.404
I don't know,
but I sure believe in evil.

11:00.438 --> 11:02.556
It was a woman who hit me.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.074
I saw her face

11:04.109 --> 11:07.361
just before she plowed
right into me.

11:07.395 --> 11:09.530
But she didn't stop.

11:09.564 --> 11:12.566
She left me here to die.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.419
I am so sorry.

11:15.453 --> 11:17.288
I hope there is a God.

11:17.339 --> 11:19.573
'Cause that woman is evil,
and I want her punished.

11:19.591 --> 11:23.010
Don't worry.

11:23.044 --> 11:26.046
She will be.

11:28.466 --> 11:31.518
She will be.

11:37.578 --> 11:39.529
Morning, Carmen.

11:39.580 --> 11:40.497
Hey.

11:40.531 --> 11:42.315
Did you make the coffee?

11:43.501 --> 11:45.585
I'm sorry.
I've been so busy, I forgot.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.671
Oh, no. It's no problem.
I'll just have a soda.

11:47.705 --> 11:49.122
Okay.

11:53.211 --> 11:55.161
Well, it sure has been nice

11:55.179 --> 11:57.514
getting to spend
some time with A.J.

11:57.548 --> 12:00.133
I hardly get to see him.

12:00.167 --> 12:03.687
Does he ever...

12:03.721 --> 12:06.189
Talk about me?

12:06.224 --> 12:07.557
Huh?

12:07.608 --> 12:10.560
I-I only ask because, uh,

12:10.611 --> 12:12.279
he's just so hard to read.

12:12.313 --> 12:14.564
I'm never quite sure how
he feels about me. Oh.

12:14.615 --> 12:16.032
Give him time.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.401
Mm.
You'll find out.

12:18.619 --> 12:21.621
You know, I was thinking of
asking if we could live together.

12:21.656 --> 12:24.207
Then at least I'd get to see him
once in a while.

12:26.744 --> 12:29.545
So he's never talked
about me at all?

12:29.580 --> 12:31.297
You know, we don't really
talk that much.

12:31.332 --> 12:33.549
Of course. You're here to work,
not socialize.

12:33.584 --> 12:34.918
Exactly.

12:37.254 --> 12:39.305
- Would you like some help?
- With what?

12:39.340 --> 12:41.007
Cleaning the kitchen.

12:41.041 --> 12:44.344
I couldn't ask you to do that.
You're a guest here.

12:44.378 --> 12:46.679
Oh, no. It's okay.
I-I love cleaning.

12:46.713 --> 12:48.097
Why?

12:48.148 --> 12:49.732
I find it soothing.

12:49.767 --> 12:51.100
Why?

12:51.151 --> 12:52.652
I don't know.
Don't you like to clean?

12:52.686 --> 12:54.053
No.

12:54.071 --> 12:55.855
Then why are you a maid?

12:55.889 --> 13:00.660
I have no good answer
for that.

13:00.694 --> 13:01.911
Thanks.

13:01.946 --> 13:04.747
My therapist says
that my need to clean

13:04.782 --> 13:08.701
is an attempt to impose order
on my chaotic inner life.

13:08.735 --> 13:11.671
But I think I just
like the smell of soap.

13:11.705 --> 13:14.257
You missed a spot.
Oh?

13:16.126 --> 13:18.177
You know, if you want,

13:18.212 --> 13:20.596
I could help clean
the rest of the house.

13:20.631 --> 13:22.098
Are you sure you're gay?

13:22.132 --> 13:24.767
'Cause I could
jump your bones right now.

13:24.802 --> 13:27.136
What can I say?
I just love cleaning.

13:27.187 --> 13:30.139
Well, my mess is your party.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.608
All right.

13:34.194 --> 13:39.098
So Alejandro's never told you
that he's serious about me?

13:41.201 --> 13:43.286
- Sorry.
- That's too bad.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.906
It would just be so much easier
if I were living here.

13:48.208 --> 13:51.411
It sure would.

13:58.085 --> 14:01.787
I looked for you last night,
but you were gone.

14:01.805 --> 14:04.340
Yeah. I had to visit
a friend.

14:04.391 --> 14:05.758
In the middle
of the night?

14:05.792 --> 14:08.011
We had some issues
to discuss.

14:08.062 --> 14:09.128
Did you need me
for something?

14:10.647 --> 14:13.983
Michael and I fought
about Olivia last night.

14:14.018 --> 14:16.986
Why don't you go with him
next time?

14:17.021 --> 14:19.439
To the hospital?
Yeah.

14:19.473 --> 14:21.024
Even if you're
in the waiting room,

14:21.075 --> 14:23.993
you'll be Reminding Michael
that you're on his side.

14:24.028 --> 14:27.447
Before you know it,
he'll be saying, "Olivia who"?

14:27.481 --> 14:29.949
You're so smart.

14:29.983 --> 14:32.368
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

14:32.419 --> 14:34.987
So what were
your friend's issues?

14:35.005 --> 14:37.006
Nothing big.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.174
Marisol?

14:39.510 --> 14:42.762
I tell you everything
about my life,

14:42.796 --> 14:44.764
and you never tell me
anything about yours.

14:44.798 --> 14:46.849
Why is that?

14:48.469 --> 14:51.854
My life... is just
not that interesting.

14:51.889 --> 14:54.807
Now...
If you'll excuse me.

15:01.681 --> 15:04.233
Oh, there you are.
I've been lookin' for you.

15:04.284 --> 15:05.651
Really?

15:05.685 --> 15:07.370
Yeah. During last night's
festivities,

15:07.404 --> 15:09.238
I spilled Merlot
on my shirt,

15:09.289 --> 15:12.158
and it left this huge stain.
Can you get that out?

15:13.994 --> 15:16.462
No.
Really?

15:16.497 --> 15:18.247
You used to be a whiz
with wine stains.

15:18.298 --> 15:21.334
Oh, I can get the stain out.
I choose not to.

15:21.368 --> 15:23.086
I beg your pardon?

15:23.137 --> 15:25.338
Do you really think
I would do anything

15:25.372 --> 15:27.390
to make your stay here easier?

15:27.424 --> 15:28.724
You're not happy

15:28.759 --> 15:30.376
Genevieve and I
are seeing each other.

15:30.394 --> 15:32.311
No. I'm not.

15:32.346 --> 15:34.180
You're worried
that I'll hurt her again.

15:34.214 --> 15:35.898
You're 2-for-2.

15:35.933 --> 15:38.234
Would you believe
that I've changed?

15:38.268 --> 15:39.569
Not you, Mr. leopard.

15:39.603 --> 15:42.054
Your spots are where
they've always been.

15:42.072 --> 15:46.159
Now why do you think
you can talk to me this way?

15:46.193 --> 15:48.778
Because I'm the only one
in this room

15:48.829 --> 15:50.246
Genevieve can trust.

15:50.280 --> 15:54.000
She knows it, I know it,
and you know it.

15:54.034 --> 15:57.753
Genevieve told me
she loved me last night.

16:00.007 --> 16:03.242
And then she asked me if I'd
like to move back in here again.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.844
Now...

16:04.878 --> 16:07.797
Should I tell her that
you asked me not to?

16:07.848 --> 16:11.384
Or would that hurt
your very special relationship?

16:11.418 --> 16:14.137
Go ahead. Move in.

16:14.188 --> 16:18.891
But I still won't do
your laundry.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.331
So... what happened?

16:42.366 --> 16:44.534
I called the ambulance,

16:44.585 --> 16:47.920
and then we went
to the hospital.

16:47.955 --> 16:51.874
Is the man gonna be okay?

16:51.925 --> 16:54.043
His name is Frank.

16:54.094 --> 16:56.345
He's an ad exec
from la Jolla.

16:56.380 --> 16:59.348
And, yes,
he's going to be okay.

17:02.335 --> 17:04.136
Thank God.

17:04.170 --> 17:05.671
He doesn't have any family,

17:05.689 --> 17:08.339
so I told him I'd go visit him
every Friday and Tuesday.

17:08.358 --> 17:11.359
That's nice of you.

17:11.395 --> 17:14.146
It's what human beings do.

17:14.180 --> 17:16.983
They look after each other.

17:17.017 --> 17:19.852
You can stop
shooting daggers at me.

17:19.869 --> 17:22.204
I feel guilty enough
as it is.

17:22.239 --> 17:24.323
Really?

17:24.357 --> 17:25.523
I do.

17:25.541 --> 17:27.126
I feel awful.

17:27.160 --> 17:31.196
And I'm totally happy
to let you visit him.

17:31.215 --> 17:32.548
Let me?

17:32.583 --> 17:35.418
I wasn't asking
your permission.

17:35.469 --> 17:37.303
I realize you're tired,

17:37.337 --> 17:40.039
but you need to can
the attitude.

17:40.057 --> 17:43.593
Are you not paying attention?

17:43.644 --> 17:47.179
You don't tell me
what to do anymore.

17:47.213 --> 17:49.548
It's over.

17:49.566 --> 17:52.184
You're quitting?

17:52.218 --> 17:53.385
Oh, no.

17:53.403 --> 17:55.488
Your baby needs me.

17:55.522 --> 17:58.190
And so does Mr. Spence.

17:58.224 --> 18:00.392
But you and me...

18:00.410 --> 18:02.561
We are done.

18:02.579 --> 18:04.664
I'm sorry.

18:04.698 --> 18:07.917
But I will not allow you
to speak to me that way.

18:07.951 --> 18:10.286
What are you gonna do?

18:10.337 --> 18:11.754
Call the cops?

18:13.790 --> 18:16.375
I'm sorry I didn't call
an ambulance.

18:16.409 --> 18:19.929
But that man could have
sued me or had me arrested.

18:19.963 --> 18:21.914
He could have ruined
my life!

18:21.932 --> 18:23.599
Maybe it needs
to be ruined.

18:23.634 --> 18:25.351
You take it all
for granted.

18:25.385 --> 18:27.086
No, I don't!

18:27.104 --> 18:28.437
You ignore your baby.

18:28.472 --> 18:31.307
You cheat on your husband!

18:31.358 --> 18:33.643
Yes! I make mistakes.
I admit it!

18:33.694 --> 18:36.529
But I don't go out of my way
to hurt people.

18:36.563 --> 18:38.064
I'm a good person!

18:38.098 --> 18:40.149
No! No, you're not!

18:40.200 --> 18:41.567
I am a good person.

18:41.601 --> 18:44.704
And i deserve to be happy.

18:44.738 --> 18:47.406
But I didn't take
what I need

18:47.440 --> 18:50.509
because... I didn't want
to hurt you.

18:50.544 --> 18:52.912
I'm sorry. What?

18:52.946 --> 18:56.382
I know the truth now.

18:56.416 --> 18:58.084
You are bad.

18:58.118 --> 19:00.386
So I won't feel guilty.

19:00.420 --> 19:03.189
And I'm gonna be happy...

19:03.223 --> 19:05.124
Very soon!

19:05.158 --> 19:06.225
Seriously, Rosie,

19:06.259 --> 19:08.227
I don't understand
what you mean.

19:08.261 --> 19:09.428
You will.

19:09.462 --> 19:11.981
God will punish you
for what you've done,

19:12.015 --> 19:15.601
and he will use me
to do it.

19:33.405 --> 19:34.873
You expecting someone?

19:34.907 --> 19:35.924
No.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.595
Hey.

19:41.646 --> 19:42.813
It's Marisol, right?

19:42.847 --> 19:45.232
- Yes.
- Is Mr. Stappord in?

19:45.267 --> 19:48.569
Remi. What are you
doing here?

19:48.603 --> 19:51.188
I got a message
to meet you at your house.

19:51.222 --> 19:53.691
I'm sorry.
Who called you?

19:53.725 --> 19:55.726
Some lady.
She said it was urgent.

19:55.744 --> 19:57.561
I'm... confused.

19:57.579 --> 19:59.730
Let me call my secretary
and see what's going on.

20:05.754 --> 20:07.621
May I help you?

20:07.672 --> 20:09.873
Excuse me?
I only need a minute.

20:09.907 --> 20:11.575
Who are you?
Ida Hayes.

20:11.593 --> 20:13.744
I called this meeting.
Thank you for coming.

20:13.762 --> 20:14.962
I'm sorry,
but why do you think

20:15.013 --> 20:16.680
you can just walk
into someone's home?

20:16.715 --> 20:18.966
I'm an attorney
representing Eddie Suarez...

20:19.017 --> 20:21.852
The man falsely accused
of killing Flora Hernandez.

20:21.886 --> 20:23.053
Well, I doubt
if we can help you.

20:23.087 --> 20:24.188
But you should
make an appointment.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.056
Oh, I think you can help me.

20:26.090 --> 20:27.775
It seems Mr. Delatour here

20:27.809 --> 20:29.059
was the father
of Flora's unborn child.

20:29.093 --> 20:30.694
Whoa! What?
You need to leave now.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.896
Flora was pregnant?
Don't say anything.

20:32.930 --> 20:35.282
Surely you knew.
Isn't that why you killed her?

20:35.317 --> 20:37.785
Oh, my God. Lady, you need
to get out of my house now,

20:37.819 --> 20:39.069
or I will throw you out.

20:39.103 --> 20:41.205
You heard the man.
Come on. Let's go.

20:41.239 --> 20:42.623
What the hell is going on?

20:42.657 --> 20:44.208
Why would someone think
I killed Flora?

20:44.242 --> 20:45.326
Let's just go talk in my office.

20:45.377 --> 20:46.827
Mr. Stappord,
I am so sorry.

20:46.878 --> 20:49.046
I tried to stop that woman
from coming in.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.999
I think you could have
tried harder.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.308
You can't break up
with Scott.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.093
Why not?

21:03.127 --> 21:05.095
Because...
He's a magnificent man

21:05.129 --> 21:07.931
with a selfless heart,
and he's in love with you.

21:07.965 --> 21:09.767
Well, I'm not
in love with him.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.769
But maybe you need time,
Alejandro.

21:11.803 --> 21:12.903
Date him a few more weeks,

21:12.937 --> 21:14.605
at least until
Odessa comes back.

21:14.639 --> 21:17.191
What does Odessa have
to do with...

21:17.242 --> 21:19.810
But my point is that he's nice.
Don't overthink it.

21:19.828 --> 21:22.363
The truth is I'm not sure
if he's in love with me

21:22.414 --> 21:24.865
or my rock star lifestyle.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.485
Why would you say that?

21:28.503 --> 21:31.038
We've barely been dating
two months,

21:31.089 --> 21:33.841
and he's already dropping hints
about moving in here.

21:36.511 --> 21:38.929
I don't deny there are people
in your life

21:38.963 --> 21:41.832
who try to use you
for their own personal gain.

21:41.850 --> 21:44.718
Hmm. I know those vultures,
and they disgust me.

21:44.769 --> 21:47.388
But Scott is not one of them.
He adores you.

21:47.439 --> 21:49.773
So why
is he always criticizing me?

21:49.808 --> 21:52.309
He's helping you
to be a better person.

21:52.343 --> 21:54.778
I like to think
I am a good person.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.530
Well, and I like to think
I don't need any makeup.

21:56.564 --> 22:00.200
But we're
kidding ourselves.

22:00.235 --> 22:03.203
Since when are you
such a fan of Scott's?

22:03.238 --> 22:05.873
Well, I've gotten to know him
these last few days,

22:05.907 --> 22:08.325
and... we've become close.

22:08.359 --> 22:10.294
Really?
Mm-hmm.

22:10.328 --> 22:14.381
Then maybe
you can do me a favor.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.216
Favor?

22:16.251 --> 22:18.385
Tell Scott I'm dumping him.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.588
What?

22:21.639 --> 22:23.307
I don't have time
for any drama right now.

22:23.341 --> 22:25.208
Just tell him I moved on.

22:25.226 --> 22:26.760
I can't say that to him.

22:26.811 --> 22:28.262
- Why not?
- Because!

22:28.313 --> 22:30.764
My engh... lishe's not so good.

22:30.815 --> 22:33.016
You just got done telling me
that he's magnificent,

22:33.050 --> 22:34.768
selfless.
You speak great English.

22:34.819 --> 22:37.053
Yeah, I only know enough
to bring people together,

22:37.072 --> 22:38.822
not tear them apart.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.441
look...

22:40.492 --> 22:42.910
I can see that
you really care about Scott.

22:42.944 --> 22:47.197
So... I'm sure you'll find
a way to let him down easy.

22:59.377 --> 23:03.130
There was no one out front.

23:03.181 --> 23:05.466
What do you want,
mr Delatour?

23:05.517 --> 23:09.937
Are you sure
I was the father?

23:09.971 --> 23:12.139
Yes.

23:12.190 --> 23:15.192
Well...

23:15.226 --> 23:17.478
I didn't kill her.

23:17.529 --> 23:20.447
I believe you.

23:25.203 --> 23:28.455
Is there anything else
you can tell me about Flora?

23:28.490 --> 23:31.625
I met her at a party.

23:31.659 --> 23:34.545
She was with Eddie,
but she kept hitting on me.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.296
She got my number
and we hooked up

23:36.331 --> 23:37.881
a couple of times,
but that's it.

23:37.916 --> 23:41.117
She'd call me, but I was...

23:41.136 --> 23:42.586
I was busy with school.

23:44.556 --> 23:47.558
And then I found out
she was dead

23:47.592 --> 23:49.092
and that your client
was arrested,

23:49.126 --> 23:52.062
but that is all I know.
I swear.

23:52.096 --> 23:53.430
Is that why you came
down here...

23:53.464 --> 23:55.599
Just to tell me
you're innocent?

23:58.019 --> 24:01.822
I don't think my lawyer is being
completely honest with me.

24:01.856 --> 24:03.907
I don't think so either.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.642
Did you know

24:05.660 --> 24:08.111
that Flora Hernandez
had been sexually assaulted?

24:08.145 --> 24:10.197
No.

24:10.248 --> 24:13.917
Well, Michael Stappord
was negotiating a settlement

24:13.952 --> 24:16.503
on behalf of her assailant.

24:16.538 --> 24:17.988
For some reason
we don't understand,

24:18.006 --> 24:20.040
Flora felt there was
a connection between

24:20.091 --> 24:23.043
the father of her baby
and the man who attacked her.

24:26.097 --> 24:29.466
Any thoughts you have
will be greatly appreciated.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.468
Did you talk to him?

24:31.502 --> 24:33.854
He's agreed to a settlement.

24:33.888 --> 24:35.272
But only in exchange

24:35.306 --> 24:38.859
for a graceful end
to this situation.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.697
Are you leaving?

24:43.731 --> 24:46.149
Oh, I've got a meeting.
It starts in ten minutes,

24:46.183 --> 24:49.620
and it's in Burbank,
which is 20 minutes away. So...

24:49.654 --> 24:52.739
Well, I'm about to take
a nice, long shower.

24:54.909 --> 24:58.194
And I'm gonna be
thinking about how happy I am

24:58.213 --> 25:00.497
the entire time.

25:06.704 --> 25:10.224
You make getting clean
sound so dirty.

25:18.950 --> 25:20.618
Oh, hi!

25:20.652 --> 25:21.702
I'm Margo Grayson.

25:21.753 --> 25:23.654
- Oh, Phillipe Delatour.
- Oh, good.

25:23.672 --> 25:25.656
I'm from Westside wine imports.
I'm delivering

25:25.674 --> 25:27.208
the cabernet sauvignon
you ordered.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.593
Excuse me?
It's a 2008 Woodridge.

25:29.628 --> 25:31.929
- You have excellent taste.
- Well, thank you.

25:31.963 --> 25:34.632
- But I didn't order any wine.
- Really?

25:34.666 --> 25:36.934
The card says,
"Phillipe Delatour."

25:36.968 --> 25:39.503
Oh, shoot. This might
have been a gift.

25:39.521 --> 25:41.689
And now I've ruined
the surprise.

25:41.723 --> 25:45.809
- It's all right. I won't tell.
- Thank you.

25:45.843 --> 25:48.529
You are very sweet.

25:52.617 --> 25:56.153
So... Margo?
How do you spell that?

25:56.187 --> 25:58.155
With on "o," "o-t,"

25:58.189 --> 26:00.708
uh, "a-u-x"?
"O."

26:00.742 --> 26:03.244
I don't know any Margos
who spell it with an "x."

26:03.295 --> 26:05.246
Well, the most famous
was probably Margaux Hemingway,

26:05.297 --> 26:06.714
and it was spelled that way

26:06.748 --> 26:08.332
because on the night
she was conceived,

26:08.366 --> 26:10.551
her parents consumed an entire
bottle of chateau Margaux.

26:10.585 --> 26:13.337
Wine trivia.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.872
You must be a connoisseur.

26:15.891 --> 26:16.873
Well, yes, I am.

26:16.892 --> 26:20.177
And, uh...
Not just of wine.

26:20.211 --> 26:22.813
I'll bet.

26:22.847 --> 26:25.149
So...

26:25.183 --> 26:28.986
That's my personal number
there, Margo.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.906
Perhaps we can do some...
Business together.

26:31.940 --> 26:34.858
Perhaps.

26:44.002 --> 26:48.172
He gave me his card
just like you said he would.

26:48.206 --> 26:51.208
Thank you for doing this.

26:51.242 --> 26:52.576
It was fun.

26:52.594 --> 26:54.295
And I think I was
pretty convincing.

26:54.346 --> 26:57.014
All you had to be
is pretty.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.638
That's right. I'm pregnant.

27:06.257 --> 27:08.692
Are you saying
my client is the father?

27:08.727 --> 27:09.893
No.

27:09.927 --> 27:12.146
But he knows who is,

27:12.197 --> 27:15.232
and they are very close.

27:19.788 --> 27:21.822
Do you know who
they're talking about?

27:23.291 --> 27:25.042
Remi?

27:25.076 --> 27:27.077
This is important.

27:27.111 --> 27:29.747
I can't help you.

27:31.616 --> 27:33.968
You know something.
I can tell.

27:34.002 --> 27:36.303
How can I know anything?

27:36.338 --> 27:39.640
Everybody always lies
to me.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.401
Marisol, it's me.

27:50.435 --> 27:52.135
Listen...

27:52.153 --> 27:55.406
Michael Stappord is gonna get
a phone call very soon.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.275
Do me a favor
and listen to it, okay?

28:05.917 --> 28:09.920
Hey, Mr. Spence.
It's me.

28:11.373 --> 28:14.008
How is New York?

28:14.042 --> 28:16.710
Oh, really?

28:16.761 --> 28:19.463
I'm so glad.

28:19.497 --> 28:22.883
Listen, I want to talk
to you about something.

28:22.934 --> 28:26.186
You have a second?

28:26.221 --> 28:29.273
When you come back home,

28:29.307 --> 28:32.810
I want us to be together.

28:32.844 --> 28:36.346
No, no, not like before.

28:36.364 --> 28:38.982
I want you to leave your wife.

28:40.318 --> 28:43.454
Your message sounded urgent.

28:43.488 --> 28:44.988
What's going on?

28:45.022 --> 28:46.523
Howard...

28:46.541 --> 28:50.026
I want you to negotiate
something else into my contract.

28:50.045 --> 28:51.712
Another perk?

28:51.746 --> 28:53.196
I want to use
the studio's private jet.

28:53.214 --> 28:54.415
But just for one day.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.467
Why? What's going on?

28:56.501 --> 28:59.002
I have this maid.

28:59.036 --> 29:01.388
I really upset her.

29:01.423 --> 29:04.541
And I want to do
something nice for her.

29:04.559 --> 29:06.927
Like what? You gonna take her
on a little vacation?

29:06.978 --> 29:10.314
I'm going to fly to Mexico
and go get her little boy.

29:10.348 --> 29:13.767
And then I'm going to bring him
back here to America.

29:13.818 --> 29:16.320
That will be
a lovely surprise.

29:16.322 --> 29:20.491
Won't it, tough?

29:29.871 --> 29:31.071
Thank you.

29:34.793 --> 29:35.960
Finally.

29:36.011 --> 29:39.764
Where have you been?

29:39.798 --> 29:42.416
Did you hear about
what happened today?

29:42.434 --> 29:45.603
Do you need me for
anything else, Mr. Stappord?

29:45.637 --> 29:49.190
Uh, hold on.
I'm going into my office.

29:49.224 --> 29:51.776
Yeah, just hold on.

29:51.810 --> 29:53.894
Just be patient.

29:53.928 --> 29:56.614
Yeah, I understand.

30:06.941 --> 30:10.127
What are you doing?

30:10.162 --> 30:11.162
Oh.

30:11.213 --> 30:13.247
I... was checking to see

30:13.281 --> 30:15.132
if Michael
was done with his call.

30:16.784 --> 30:19.503
I need to...
Clean in there, but...

30:19.554 --> 30:21.222
He's still on the phone.

30:21.256 --> 30:23.474
So I'll just...

30:45.113 --> 30:47.814
Oh, hey, Carmen.
Scott.

30:47.833 --> 30:50.201
Did you clean in here last night?
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

30:50.252 --> 30:53.537
And my choices were either
vacuuming or Ambien.

30:53.588 --> 30:56.957
And then I realized vacuuming
is nature's Ambien.

30:56.991 --> 30:58.125
Ta-da!

30:58.159 --> 31:00.094
So... where's Alejandro?

31:00.128 --> 31:04.048
Oh, he...
He went to work.

31:04.099 --> 31:06.517
Oh.
Without saying good-bye?

31:06.551 --> 31:09.937
I mean...
That's kind of rude.

31:09.971 --> 31:13.607
Scott, sit down.
We need to talk.

31:13.642 --> 31:15.059
You know, I was only in
the shower for five minutes.

31:15.110 --> 31:16.277
He could have waited.

31:16.311 --> 31:17.695
Yeah, listen...
Oh! Oh! Did you see?

31:17.729 --> 31:19.280
I got the wine stain
out of that cushion.

31:19.314 --> 31:22.116
It took me two hours, but it is gone.

31:22.150 --> 31:23.534
Oh, my...

31:23.568 --> 31:25.119
Please don't make this

31:25.153 --> 31:27.288
harder than it needs to be.

31:27.322 --> 31:30.190
Honey, what's wrong?

31:30.208 --> 31:32.326
Alejandro...

31:32.360 --> 31:34.044
He doesn't want
to date you anymore.

31:34.079 --> 31:36.630
What?

31:36.665 --> 31:37.665
He...

31:37.699 --> 31:39.750
He doesn't love you.

31:42.637 --> 31:46.707
But if it's any consolation,
I love you very much.

31:46.725 --> 31:48.058
I-I'm sorry, uh...

31:48.093 --> 31:51.395
Let me see if I understand
what's happening here.

31:51.429 --> 31:54.231
Alejandro is having
his maid break up with me?

31:54.266 --> 31:56.901
I know.
It's a little tacky.

31:56.935 --> 32:00.070
No. No, no. That's not the word
that I would use.

32:00.105 --> 32:05.058
Let's see, how would
I describe this situation?

32:05.076 --> 32:08.579
How about... "Infuriating"?

32:10.031 --> 32:11.582
Scott! Oh, my God!

32:11.616 --> 32:13.117
Or maybe I could call
this whole experience...

32:13.168 --> 32:14.234
I don't know.

32:14.252 --> 32:17.671
Humiliating!

32:17.706 --> 32:18.905
Okay! Okay!
You've made your point.

32:18.924 --> 32:20.090
You have to go now!
No!

32:20.125 --> 32:22.509
No, no, I haven't got it
quite right yet.

32:22.544 --> 32:25.078
Ah! Yes. The word
that best describes

32:25.096 --> 32:28.215
what happened here today
is...

32:31.136 --> 32:35.088
"Unforgivable"!

32:40.612 --> 32:43.230
Do me a favor.

32:43.264 --> 32:46.433
Don't clean any of this up.

32:46.451 --> 32:49.620
I want Alejandro to know
what he did to me today.

33:08.089 --> 33:10.808
Hey! Hey.
What are you doing here?

33:10.842 --> 33:13.010
Going to the movies tonight.

33:13.061 --> 33:14.311
Did you forget?

33:14.346 --> 33:17.147
Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry.

33:17.182 --> 33:19.266
No worries. Are you okay?

33:19.300 --> 33:22.152
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...

33:22.187 --> 33:24.071
Dealing with some stuff.

33:24.105 --> 33:26.106
We don't have to go
if you don't feel like it.

33:26.140 --> 33:27.808
Thanks.

33:27.826 --> 33:30.277
I'd probably be better company
some other time anyway.

33:31.446 --> 33:34.415
Remi, Valentina!
Thank God you're here.

33:34.449 --> 33:35.949
What's going on?

33:35.983 --> 33:38.202
Oh, the most exciting thing
ever!

33:38.253 --> 33:39.253
Zoila!

33:39.287 --> 33:41.021
What?!

33:41.056 --> 33:42.189
Get down here!

33:42.223 --> 33:44.525
I'm styling your hair.

33:44.559 --> 33:46.860
You can do that later
after I'm gone.

33:46.895 --> 33:50.214
Come! There's gonna be
an announcement!

33:50.265 --> 33:52.299
Everybody, come!

33:58.306 --> 34:00.057
What's with the champagne?

34:00.108 --> 34:01.308
We are toasting.

34:01.342 --> 34:03.027
To what?

34:03.061 --> 34:05.679
Well, as you all know,
Genevieve and I have been

34:05.697 --> 34:07.815
spending a lot of time
together lately.

34:07.849 --> 34:10.400
And, uh, I've become
increasingly aware

34:10.452 --> 34:12.902
of how empty my life
has been without her.

34:12.954 --> 34:14.905
So...

34:14.956 --> 34:17.041
I asked her to marry me.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.661
And this darling woman...
Girl.

34:21.696 --> 34:25.866
Girl... has agreed
to give me a second chance

34:25.884 --> 34:28.034
of being the happiest man
on earth.

34:28.053 --> 34:33.172
So here's to
love and redemption.

34:33.206 --> 34:34.475
Cheers.

34:36.094 --> 34:38.978
- Cheers!
- Cheer... cheers!

34:40.581 --> 34:43.132
Guys, you have to raise
your glasses and sip.

34:43.184 --> 34:44.551
No.

34:46.087 --> 34:49.389
A toast is a blessing,
and I will not bless that man.

34:49.422 --> 34:50.524
Zoila.

34:50.558 --> 34:52.609
What a thing to say.

34:52.643 --> 34:54.594
No, it's all right,
darling.

34:54.612 --> 34:56.530
Zoila's just
worried about you.

34:56.563 --> 34:59.950
She thinks I'm incapable
of evolving.

35:01.569 --> 35:03.654
What's that?

35:03.705 --> 35:07.240
My friend Margo dropped off
some wine earlier today.

35:07.274 --> 35:09.459
She flirted
with Charles Darwin here,

35:09.494 --> 35:11.128
and he gave her his card

35:11.162 --> 35:14.998
with his private number on it,
just like I knew he would.

35:15.049 --> 35:16.083
Th-this is stupid.

35:16.117 --> 35:17.467
She is spinning
a nothing moment

35:17.502 --> 35:19.119
wildly out of control.

35:19.137 --> 35:21.722
He didn't have the decency
to leave the house

35:21.756 --> 35:24.290
before putting the moves
on another woman.

35:24.309 --> 35:25.642
Why don't you just
shut up?!

35:25.677 --> 35:28.178
Phillipe!
No, I have to say this.

35:29.630 --> 35:31.982
This is my family, not yours.
You are not one of us.

35:32.016 --> 35:33.900
Your inclusion in this event

35:33.935 --> 35:36.103
was merely an act of courtesy
on our part,

35:36.137 --> 35:38.989
and now you've ruined it with
your melodramatic accusation.

35:39.023 --> 35:40.974
If you continue
to disrupt our lives,

35:40.992 --> 35:42.492
we will have to make
a change,

35:42.527 --> 35:44.361
and it will not matter
one iota

35:44.412 --> 35:46.997
that your daughter is doing our son.

36:01.295 --> 36:02.629
Remi!

36:11.338 --> 36:12.806
If there's nothing else?

36:26.564 --> 36:28.231
So...

36:28.265 --> 36:31.534
How are you doing?

36:31.569 --> 36:34.537
It's been rough.

36:35.072 --> 36:37.073
I'll bet.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.462
We're going ahead
with the wedding.

36:48.502 --> 36:49.635
Why?

36:49.670 --> 36:51.420
I love him.

36:51.454 --> 36:53.089
Love someone else.

36:53.123 --> 36:54.957
I have.

36:54.975 --> 36:58.761
Six marriages, countless affairs.

36:58.795 --> 37:01.630
But when I'm alone at night,

37:01.648 --> 37:04.466
he's the one I think about.

37:04.484 --> 37:06.519
He will continue
to cheat on you.

37:06.570 --> 37:09.071
I wouldn't be
the first wife

37:09.106 --> 37:11.324
who learns
to look the other way.

37:11.358 --> 37:13.609
I don't understand you.

37:13.643 --> 37:15.661
Where's your dignity?

37:15.696 --> 37:19.749
What's dignified about
growing old alone?

37:19.783 --> 37:22.818
You are still an extraordinarily
beautiful woman.

37:22.836 --> 37:25.871
There are men who would kill
to be with you.

37:25.922 --> 37:28.124
Not as many as
there used to be.

37:28.158 --> 37:32.128
Sweetheart, I am sorry.
I cannot support this.

37:32.162 --> 37:35.831
Zoila...

37:35.849 --> 37:37.883
You are family to me.

37:37.934 --> 37:41.387
And I need you so much,

37:41.438 --> 37:43.606
but I need him, too.

37:44.691 --> 37:46.442
So please...

37:46.476 --> 37:50.479
Don't make me choose
between the two of you.

37:50.513 --> 37:53.566
How am I supposed
to work for him,

37:53.617 --> 37:56.152
knowing that
he's hurting you?

37:58.405 --> 38:00.689
Just don't care so much.

38:00.707 --> 38:01.907
Don't worry about me.

38:01.958 --> 38:03.859
Just...

38:03.894 --> 38:06.162
Shut up and do my job?

38:15.555 --> 38:17.506
Dr. Baker to C.T.U.

38:17.540 --> 38:19.708
Dr. Baker to C.T.U., please.

38:22.813 --> 38:25.681
So how's Olivia?

38:25.715 --> 38:27.600
Anesthesiologist on duty
to O.R. 1.

38:27.651 --> 38:29.985
Sh-she's better.

38:30.020 --> 38:31.487
Meds are helping.

38:31.521 --> 38:34.556
The, uh, therapist
is working wonders.

38:34.574 --> 38:36.025
I'm so glad.

38:40.163 --> 38:43.449
You'll never know
how much it means to me...

38:43.500 --> 38:44.667
You being here.

38:44.701 --> 38:48.754
I'm your wife.
My job is to support you.

38:48.789 --> 38:51.757
I am sorry it took me so long
to figure that out.

38:51.792 --> 38:54.460
What changed your mind?

38:54.511 --> 38:56.629
I talked to Marisol,

38:56.680 --> 38:59.799
and she straightened me out.

38:59.850 --> 39:02.635
Golly, she's smart.

39:02.686 --> 39:05.688
She really is.

39:08.475 --> 39:10.192
Under the heading
of loyal wife,

39:10.227 --> 39:11.610
there's something
I should tell you.

39:11.645 --> 39:13.779
It may be nothing, but...

39:13.814 --> 39:15.097
What is it?

39:15.115 --> 39:17.783
I caught Marisol
eavesdropping.

39:17.818 --> 39:19.735
What?

39:19.769 --> 39:22.121
Last night, you had
a phone call after dinner,

39:22.155 --> 39:24.657
and she was right outside
your office door.

39:24.708 --> 39:28.127
I'm sure there's a logical
explanation, but...

39:28.161 --> 39:30.296
I thought
I should tell you.

39:32.582 --> 39:35.217
You were right to tell me.

39:35.252 --> 39:38.220
So what should we do?

39:38.255 --> 39:40.589
I want you
to keep an eye on her.

39:40.623 --> 39:42.291
See what she's up to.

39:42.309 --> 39:45.478
And don't let her know
that things have changed.

39:45.512 --> 39:48.180
Well, has something changed?

39:48.231 --> 39:52.151
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

40:09.485 --> 40:11.253
Are you sure
you don't want any help?

40:11.288 --> 40:14.173
I'm responsible
for this mess.

40:14.207 --> 40:16.592
I'm gonna be the one
to clean it up.

40:16.626 --> 40:20.129
I still think
you should call the police.

40:20.163 --> 40:21.714
And tell them what?

40:21.765 --> 40:24.683
My gay boyfriend
threw a fit?

40:24.718 --> 40:25.834
Well, you could, you know?

40:28.305 --> 40:30.773
No.

40:30.807 --> 40:32.525
I can't.

40:36.813 --> 40:39.698
I'm sorry your life
is so complicated.

40:39.733 --> 40:41.534
Hey.

40:41.568 --> 40:44.987
I'm the one who wanted
to be a star.

41:14.768 --> 41:20.272
And that is a picture of us
at his place in the mountains.

41:20.323 --> 41:23.993
I remember that weekend
like it was five minutes ago.

41:24.027 --> 41:26.895
It was just so...

41:26.913 --> 41:28.781
So magical.

41:28.832 --> 41:33.669
I couldn't believe
that we were falling in love.

41:33.703 --> 41:37.840
Of course we... we weren't.
It was just me.

41:37.874 --> 41:40.626
So...

41:40.677 --> 41:42.928
Alejandro Rubio
is into guys?

41:42.963 --> 41:46.348
People are gonna freak out.

41:46.383 --> 41:50.769
How soon before
the story hits the press?

41:50.804 --> 41:53.389
Almost immediately.
