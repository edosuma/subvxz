04:31.314 --> 04:32.683
What's wrong.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.815
Oh my god, why are you shaking?

04:34.839 --> 04:36.121
It's happening again.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.581
What's happening again?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.867
I was in the tub and I
thought I heard somebody

04:42.891 --> 04:44.129
or something.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.565
I don't know.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.741
It was there and it touched
me and then I ran out

04:47.765 --> 04:49.656
of the bathroom, and when
I came back the mirror

04:49.680 --> 04:51.354
was busted.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.597
Oh my god, are you serious?

taking a bath in 200 degree

05:06.480 --> 05:08.109
water for?

05:08.133 --> 05:10.590
It's obvious you opened the
door too fast and you let

05:10.614 --> 05:12.790
the cold air in,
and it's cracked.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.532
Are you seriously
saying that right now?

05:16.185 --> 05:17.665
Look at it Paul.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.193
Look, I don't know,
it's just physics.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.171
Just breath.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.936
Don't tell me to fucking breath.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.523
I'm sick of you always
acting like I'm crazy,

05:30.547 --> 05:32.549
when I'm showing
you these things!

Oh, hey Paul.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.300
Hi aunt Pat.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.239
You're almost done packing huh?

06:14.025 --> 06:16.158
What's going on?

06:26.342 --> 06:27.232
Are you okay?

06:27.256 --> 06:28.953
What happened?

06:32.174 --> 06:34.370
I must of had the
bathroom too hot,

06:34.394 --> 06:38.093
and when I opened the
door, I cracked the glass.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.246
Oh, well.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.639
I'll take care of that later.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.143
Just be careful in there okay?

06:45.666 --> 06:47.339
Okay.

06:47.363 --> 06:50.908
Oh, the lawyer is going to
give you the deed and the keys

06:50.932 --> 06:52.823
to the house in
Victorville tomorrow.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.762
Have you decided what
your'e gonna do with it?

06:56.633 --> 06:59.375
You know what aunt Pat,
I think I'm gonna keep it.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.309
Live in it.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.921
I mean it is the house
I grew up in after all.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.444
Only if you're ready.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.469
Okay?

07:06.817 --> 07:08.273
Okay.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.362
Stay for dinner Paul,
I'm making meatloaf

07:10.386 --> 07:12.127
and apple cobbler for dessert.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.844
Hmm.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.044
Homemade meatloaf or ramen
noodles at the dorms.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.612
I choose homemade meatloaf.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.372
Good choice.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.658
(CHUCKLES)

07:28.839 --> 07:31.320
(TICKING)

07:32.016 --> 07:35.343
So I was thinking that
I would take a road trip

07:35.367 --> 07:36.736
with Paul,

07:36.760 --> 07:40.721
and see Dorian after
we sign the paperwork.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.352
Maybe give him some money.

07:44.376 --> 07:47.965
Sweetheart, that man is gonna
be locked in that nuthouse

07:47.989 --> 07:49.686
for the rest of his life.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.080
He don't need money.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.493
He needs things.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.408
I'm sure there's
stuff he wants to buy.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.042
Like personal items.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.741
Besides it's his money too.

08:01.132 --> 08:04.372
Well, even after
all that's happening,

08:04.396 --> 08:06.355
guess he's still
your stepfather.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.924
I'm just happy you
keeping us in your home.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.926
You're my family.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.079
Even though my brother
doesn't deserve a daughter

08:15.103 --> 08:16.452
like you.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.879
(PHONE RINGING)

08:32.903 --> 08:36.491
Well, here are your
keys to the house,

08:36.515 --> 08:38.692
and we're done here.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.147
Thank you.

08:40.171 --> 08:40.844
Congratulations.

08:40.868 --> 08:41.888
Thank you mister.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.150

08:43.174 --> 08:44.480
Good to see you.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.382
Oh I'm gonna miss you honey.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.731
I'm gonna miss you too.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.472
We'll see each other lots okay.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.411
Alright you take care.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.195
Now be careful.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.242
Take care of my baby.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.140
You good?

09:36.401 --> 09:37.944
Yeah.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.014
Whens the last
time you seen him?

09:43.539 --> 09:45.410
I think I was 15.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.589
He moved in right after
my dad's overdose.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.462
He was really there
for me and my mom.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.512
I guess that's why I
keep trying so hard.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.927
Of course you keep trying.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.605
He's the only dad you've known.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.714
Thank you for coming.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.542
I know this isn't a
normal way a guy meets his

10:10.566 --> 10:12.089
girlfriends father.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.570
I'm here for you.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.425
You look good, Dad.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.732
Really good.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.997
This is my boyfriend Paul.

10:51.259 --> 10:53.217
It's good to meet you sir.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.096
You're not even
gonna shake his hand?

11:12.280 --> 11:15.022
I came to bring
you money Dorian.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.819
I never thought
I'd see you again.

11:33.649 --> 11:36.086
What happened, Dad?

11:45.574 --> 11:47.465
Why did you let her in?

11:47.489 --> 11:49.162
Dorian this is
your stepdaughter.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.034
Why is she in here!

11:51.058 --> 11:52.905
Hey man she's just
trying to reach out to you.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.583
You're the only family she has.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.064
Don't say anything else to him.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.202
What happened in that house?

12:07.117 --> 12:08.292
No.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.078
I didn't understand it then.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.667
What happened to my mother?

12:15.691 --> 12:17.364
I didn't understand.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.975
Tell me!

12:18.999 --> 12:20.803
Ms. King, I'm gonna have to
ask you to lower your voice

12:20.827 --> 12:22.437
you're upsetting my patient.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.155
Dorian, hands in your lap.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.094
Remember your calming words.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.121
When you can talk to
me like a real person

12:35.145 --> 12:36.625
you contact me.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.323
I'm not coming back here.

WOMAN: Hey.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.915
I didn't wanna believe it.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.332
I didn't wanna believe
it till it was too late.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.989
But now I see.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.427
The truth is digging
it's way out it's grave.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.909
I wish it was you.

13:01.432 --> 13:04.237
I wish it was that
was dead not her.

aren't any rodents running

which room we're sleeping in.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.392
You look just like her.

I haven't seen a
picture of him in ages.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.543

17:47.805 --> 17:49.938
You remember him at all?

17:54.029 --> 17:55.596
I do.

17:58.251 --> 18:01.254
You say I'm a crybaby,
no he was a crybaby.

18:06.259 --> 18:09.305
The silence in this house
was so heavy when he died.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.418
Nothing's the same
after a baby's death.

blamed herself you know?

ready for this?

There are three rooms.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.301
This one's this biggest
so I'll take this one.

19:12.325 --> 19:15.304
Kira can have my old room
and I remember my mother

19:15.328 --> 19:18.505
used the other one as a
sewing room after Joshua died.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.334
I think.

Let's go check it out.

Do you remember it?

20:13.516 --> 20:14.909
Any of it?

20:17.520 --> 20:20.499
It's weird I don't but
I feel like I lived here

20:20.523 --> 20:22.003
my whole life.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.832
Like I never left.

to keep the bed.

It's the basement
but it's locked.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.704
You know what they
say about basements.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.338
What?

23:04.470 --> 23:06.926
I didn't really have an
answer prepared for that.

One thing we must
do is kiss in there.

my roommate gets here.

I think you drew blood.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.095
Peace offering?

25:02.283 --> 25:04.459
I'm really sorry.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.810
Forget it.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.541
How bad do you
think this house is?

25:23.565 --> 25:25.219
Maintenance wise?

25:25.872 --> 25:27.110
It's not good,

25:27.134 --> 25:29.049
but it's not bad.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.443
Well that's a good thing
of having a new boyfriend.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.317
I gotta be good for something.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.079
No.

25:40.103 --> 25:41.603
Wait till after we eat.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.150
No do it now.

25:43.411 --> 25:47.067
And whatever it says lets
follow it with in bed.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.314

should have waited.

Why?

to do in fumblefuck.

do in Victorville.

Might as well stay man,
they're not gonna let you go.

been trapped here.

Well, in that case.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.574

28:29.620 --> 28:32.164

28:32.188 --> 28:33.339
I don't know.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.559
We should invest.

today and he attacked me.

I don't know.

I don't remember him to
be that type of person.

that all behind me.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.062
I agree, let's
lighten up the mood,

29:44.086 --> 29:45.479
and play a game.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.239
Play a game?

29:47.263 --> 29:48.240
What game?

29:48.264 --> 29:49.613
Hide and seek.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.488
In the dark?

29:54.749 --> 29:56.858
Yes, in the dark. (LAUGHS)

29:56.882 --> 29:59.449
What other way is there
to play hide and seek?

30:00.320 --> 30:02.670

get to know the house.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.549
I'm fine with all
the losers alright.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.271
Wasn't even here.

I saw...

A what?

I saw a mouse.

Oh come on Lex, are you serious?

34:26.194 --> 34:28.259

probably scream like a girl too.

shit about a ghost.

are you gonna with that?

35:18.072 --> 35:20.509
Hm, if you'd like I
can demonstrate on you.

35:21.510 --> 35:23.053
How do you deal
with this girl man?

35:23.077 --> 35:25.099
All she does is talk
about ghosts and shit.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.405
KIRA: He used to believe
Ray, and I'll get you

35:27.429 --> 35:28.450
to believe too.

35:28.474 --> 35:29.364
Oh yeah? No.

35:29.388 --> 35:31.172
I'm far too sane for that shit.

35:32.391 --> 35:34.064

seeing something she needs

35:34.088 --> 35:35.457
to let me know.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.545
If Alexis is seeing
something she needs to be

35:36.569 --> 35:38.092
in a looney bin.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.419
I can't believe
you would say that.

35:41.443 --> 35:42.507
I'm serious.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.074
No ghost stories.

35:44.098 --> 35:45.336
We're all adults here.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.208
Yeah, all adults
playing hide and seek.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.818
KIRA: Seriously, I think
we should order a psychic

35:48.842 --> 35:50.385
to come in and
cleanse the house.

35:50.409 --> 35:51.603
Just in case.

35:51.627 --> 35:53.151
No.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.607
You know I think that
you should leave since

35:55.631 --> 35:57.198
you don't live here.

36:00.897 --> 36:03.204
You wanna be crazy,
do it by yourself.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.969
KIRA: Don't get
in the middle of it.

36:09.993 --> 36:11.125
Ray!

36:12.648 --> 36:14.409
He's right.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.348
There are no ghosts.

36:17.087 --> 36:18.587
Ever since I've been back
in this house I've been

36:18.611 --> 36:21.701
I guess you could say
remembering things.

36:23.398 --> 36:24.636
KIRA: That's normal.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.228
Being here is triggering
childhood memories.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.404
I mean Lex,

36:33.147 --> 36:35.193
your baby brother died in here,

36:36.281 --> 36:38.476
and you found your mother dead.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.199
That's the most traumatizing
thing I can think of.

36:41.677 --> 36:44.158
I don't remember being
that close to my mother.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.180
What?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.269
I don't think...

36:48.293 --> 36:51.078
I don't feel like I
lost somebody I love.

36:51.513 --> 36:52.751
I don't know.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.492
I don't have any fond
childhood memories

36:54.516 --> 36:56.059
because of...

36:56.083 --> 36:59.434
Listen, I'm sure you and
your mother were close.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.152
The memories, they're
probably masked by the most

37:02.176 --> 37:03.482
daunting memory.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.224
Finding her dead,

37:06.789 --> 37:09.183
and that's very, very
traumatizing Lex.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.510
You have to give yourself
credit for even being able

37:12.534 --> 37:14.232
to sleep here.

37:15.668 --> 37:17.602
I have nightmares.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.149
Bad ones.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.172
Not only that, even
when I'm awake.

37:22.196 --> 37:25.634
It's almost like hallucinations.

37:26.069 --> 37:29.769
Well, a drowning and a
suicide occurred in this house.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.531
If your mother and brother
spirits are lingering...

37:33.555 --> 37:35.296
Don't talk like that.

37:37.298 --> 37:40.277
Listen, all that psychology
babble they taught you

37:40.301 --> 37:43.783
in school may help
you rationalize,

37:44.131 --> 37:47.066
but Lex, there are
somethings in this world

37:47.090 --> 37:49.267
that are way beyond
our understanding.

37:51.747 --> 37:54.900
I think we should order
a psychic to come in

37:54.924 --> 37:56.622
and cleanse the house.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.383
I do have to live here to.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.211
Oh, well thank you.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.257
I'm sure that will help
you sleep at night.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.065
Anyways.

38:06.153 --> 38:08.286
You'll thank me later.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.221
Did he leave?

38:11.245 --> 38:13.005
No he's out back smoking.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.964
Stay here with her.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.120
Yeah, don't get
in the middle of it.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.834
Alright, I'ma take off.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.334
Alexis is gonna
kill you for smoking.

38:59.293 --> 39:00.903
I don't care.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.344
You good?

39:07.170 --> 39:08.433
Yeah.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.325
How about you?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.915
Good.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.286
I broke up with Ray.

39:16.310 --> 39:17.635
What?

39:17.659 --> 39:19.792
What the hell are you
two doing here then?

39:21.315 --> 39:23.404
He doesn't know it yet.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.427
(CHUCKLES) What?

39:26.451 --> 39:28.583
I do live in bumblefuck now.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.329
I don't love him.

39:38.463 --> 39:41.770
Don't you think you should...

39:43.032 --> 39:44.991
I'm gonna marry her.

39:45.818 --> 39:47.796
You know what?

39:47.820 --> 39:49.188
I don't get guys.

39:49.212 --> 39:51.321
You call her crazy and
psycho behind her back

39:51.345 --> 39:54.261
hell to her face and
yet, I don't get it.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.282
What?

39:56.306 --> 39:58.352
You feel like hero for
sticking by the crazy chick?

39:59.440 --> 40:01.616
She's not the
craziest chick I know.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.638
I'm sick of you Paul.

40:03.662 --> 40:05.335
So what are you saying?

40:05.359 --> 40:07.361
You're really gonna marry her?

40:09.929 --> 40:12.516
I guess her inheritance
sealed that deal.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.977
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

40:16.109 --> 40:17.869
What about me?

40:17.893 --> 40:20.243
I thought you wanted
to be with me?

40:21.984 --> 40:23.856
She needs me.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.315
Well then next time your
psycho flips out on you,

40:29.339 --> 40:32.473
don't come running into my bed.

40:48.576 --> 40:50.317
(DOOR CLOSES)

41:00.196 --> 41:02.460
I don't have a peace offering.

talking to me now?

PAUL: What's wrong?

42:48.435 --> 42:50.350
It was so real.

42:51.481 --> 42:53.266
What was so real?

42:55.007 --> 42:57.009
I saw my mother.

42:58.663 --> 43:01.056
The way I found her
when I was eight.

43:02.362 --> 43:04.277
I was right there.

43:06.279 --> 43:07.952

43:07.976 --> 43:09.412

43:11.327 --> 43:13.112
Let's go to sleep.

43:26.516 --> 43:29.345
I really hope Ray brings
my mattress like he promised.

43:30.085 --> 43:32.324
He can be such a
douche sometimes.

43:32.348 --> 43:35.874
You gotta tell me what
you want to keep in here.

43:36.701 --> 43:39.007
I'd hate to throw away
anything memorable.

43:39.312 --> 43:41.357
Just get rid of it all.

43:41.706 --> 43:43.335
You sure?

43:43.359 --> 43:44.796
Yeah.

43:45.318 --> 43:46.928
Okay.

44:00.289 --> 44:01.353
Hey.

44:01.377 --> 44:02.833
Nice touch.

44:02.857 --> 44:04.511

44:26.228 --> 44:28.491
Oh fuck this man.

44:28.970 --> 44:30.339
I just came to drop it off.

44:30.363 --> 44:31.862
She can take it from here.

44:31.886 --> 44:33.255
Come on man.

44:33.279 --> 44:34.038
No.

44:34.062 --> 44:35.803
Let her go.

44:36.108 --> 44:37.476
Great now I have
to deal with this.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.043
No you don't.

44:39.067 --> 44:39.870
No drama.

44:39.894 --> 44:40.654
No meddling.

44:40.678 --> 44:41.437
Yes I do.

44:41.461 --> 44:43.178
I don't want Ray to...

44:43.202 --> 44:44.594
To what?

44:44.856 --> 44:46.834
I don't want him
to break up with her.

44:46.858 --> 44:48.511
No meddling.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.647
I have to carry
this shit by myself.

44:54.169 --> 44:55.388
What a dick.

44:58.086 --> 45:01.699
(GRUNTING)

45:22.197 --> 45:24.460
You know I could talk
to him if you want.

45:26.549 --> 45:28.092
No.

45:28.116 --> 45:29.596
It's fine.

45:30.423 --> 45:32.425

settling coming along?

45:56.884 --> 45:59.471
Good, we're do the
whole out with the old,

45:59.495 --> 46:01.038
in with the new thing.

46:01.062 --> 46:03.040
I'm not getting rid of too
much, just making it mine,

46:03.064 --> 46:03.998
you know?

46:04.022 --> 46:05.521
Yeah, I understand.

46:05.545 --> 46:07.871
Hey why don't I bring
you kids some dinner?

46:07.895 --> 46:10.178
No, you don't have to
come all the way out here.

46:10.202 --> 46:11.919
I won't have you
starving to death.

46:11.943 --> 46:13.485
I'll be fine.

46:13.509 --> 46:15.487
I'm gonna rest later anyways.

46:15.511 --> 46:17.600
Just don't forget about
your old auntie okay?

46:17.905 --> 46:19.013
I'm not.

46:19.037 --> 46:20.144
I love you.

46:20.168 --> 46:21.604
Love you too honey.

46:30.918 --> 46:33.114
I'm gonna check the
roof and the foundation.

46:33.138 --> 46:34.550
See if any repairs
need to be made.

46:34.574 --> 46:35.812
Okay.

46:35.836 --> 46:36.987
You alright?

46:37.011 --> 46:39.274
Yeah I just hope Kira's okay.

46:39.492 --> 46:41.450
Seriously, how many
times have they broken up?

46:41.973 --> 46:43.496
I'll be back.

47:13.047 --> 47:14.285
What are you doing?

47:14.309 --> 47:16.070
Just scrubbing the floor.

47:16.094 --> 47:18.183
What do you want me
to do with this stuff?

47:18.618 --> 47:20.707
Just put it in the
dumpster out back?

47:21.621 --> 47:23.536
Okay dokey.

48:51.363 --> 48:53.384
I'm cutting down
this old bird house.

48:53.408 --> 48:55.125
The wood is rotten, besides
it's bad to feed the birds...

48:55.149 --> 48:57.475
What is wrong with you?

48:57.499 --> 48:59.086
I'm not gonna get
rid of everything.

48:59.110 --> 49:01.001
Can you have a little
consideration and ask me before

49:01.025 --> 49:02.635
you get rid of stuff?

There are no pictures
anywhere of me in this house.

They're all boxed up.

hanging around somewhere.

No, those are my brother.

I don't understand why
they wouldn't have pictures

50:21.235 --> 50:22.932
of me hanging up everywhere.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.216
I don't know Lex.

50:26.240 --> 50:29.243
Look, try not to stress over it.

50:30.114 --> 50:31.221
Ask your aunt.

50:31.245 --> 50:32.725
I'm sure she knows what's up.

50:33.117 --> 50:35.225
She doesn't have any
pictures of me this young.

Alright.

50:47.261 --> 50:48.151
You good?

50:48.175 --> 50:49.761

spend some time with you.

50:56.314 --> 50:58.074
It's like you
live another state.

50:58.098 --> 51:01.382
I was thinking that after
you get out of your classes

51:01.406 --> 51:03.321
you could move down here.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.584
In here.

51:06.019 --> 51:07.475
Hm.

51:07.499 --> 51:08.998

to go work with your dad

51:09.022 --> 51:10.521
and I get it.

No, no.

51:12.112 --> 51:14.071
It's actually not a bad idea.

I can start my own
construction company.
