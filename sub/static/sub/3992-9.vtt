00:01.400 --> 00:02.719
Previously on Hannibal..

00:02.770 --> 00:05.330
- (man): This killer doesn't
think like anyone else, Jack.

00:05.370 --> 00:08.396
You'll have to find someone
who doesn't think like
anyone else to catch him.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.159
- There's no evidence I did it.
- Let him go.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.337
- You're making a mistake, Jack.
- I know what it's like

00:13.380 --> 00:15.268
to point at a killer
and have no one listen.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.346
- You pointed in
the wrong direction.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.678
- Don't lie to me, Dr. Lecter.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.689
- I believe my
brother won't stop.
- If you really want to kill

00:22.720 --> 00:26.451
your brother, Margot, wait until
you can get away with it or find
someone to do it for you.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.310
- You're Hannibal
Lecter's therapist.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.386
- (whispering): I believe you.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.298
- (Hannibal): Which answer is it
you want to hear, Will?

00:35.330 --> 00:37.321
- What's happening now

00:37.370 --> 00:40.794
and about to happen
is an answer.

00:43.470 --> 00:46.109
I want an admission.

00:48.110 --> 00:50.249
I want you to admit
what you are.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.544
- Must I denounce myself
as a monster

00:52.580 --> 00:56.084
while you still refuse to see
the one growing inside you?

01:01.890 --> 01:04.324
(He whistles.)

01:10.300 --> 01:13.565
Why not appeal
to my better nature?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.830
- I wasn't aware you had one.

01:15.870 --> 01:18.304
- No one can be fully aware

01:18.340 --> 01:20.501
of another human being
unless we love them.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.338
By that love we see potential
in our beloved.

01:26.380 --> 01:29.349
Through that love,
we allow our beloved

01:29.390 --> 01:31.449
to see their potential.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.390
Expressing that love,

01:42.430 --> 01:45.365
our beloved's potential
comes true.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.164
(He whistles.)

02:03.590 --> 02:06.787
- I promised you a reckoning.

02:09.460 --> 02:13.248
Here it is.

02:22.740 --> 02:26.176
(panﬁng)

03:06.420 --> 03:08.911
- Mmm, that smells wonderful.

03:11.590 --> 03:14.411
- Sacromonte omelet
with liver and sweetbreads.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.785
Sacromonte was
the gypsy hood of Granada.

03:18.830 --> 03:22.220
I visited Granada
when I was a young man.

03:24.030 --> 03:27.591
- I've never been.
- No?

03:27.640 --> 03:30.939
I fell in love with many things,
in particular, this dish.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.601
I remember my time there
so vividly,

03:35.640 --> 03:37.847
like I frescoed
the walls of my mind.

03:37.880 --> 03:42.647
- I used to be afraid
of losing my memory.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.648
What I wouldn't give to forget
a thing or two now.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.986
Mmm...

03:51.030 --> 03:53.351
My compliments
to the gypsy hood of Granada.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.356
- Memory gives moments

03:55.400 --> 03:59.496
immortality, but forgetfulness
promotes a healthy mind.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.462
It's good to forget.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.563
What are you trying
to forget, Jack?

04:05.610 --> 04:07.578
- Doubt.

04:07.610 --> 04:10.272
I let doubt in.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.642
- About me?

04:12.680 --> 04:14.739
- About Will.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.919
- I can no longer discuss
Will's state of mind with you

04:21.960 --> 04:24.986
or anyone else
without his consent.

04:25.030 --> 04:29.057
Will's officially my patient.
He employs me now, not the FBI.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.797
- Well, let's hope
your therapy works.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.729
- Therapy only works when
we have a genuine desire

04:35.770 --> 04:38.068
to know ourselves as we are,

04:38.110 --> 04:40.431
not as we would like to be.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.661
(banging)

06:10.870 --> 06:14.431
(roaring)
(man screaming)

06:30.220 --> 06:33.712
(theme music)

06:55.580 --> 06:57.775
- Ah.

07:11.090 --> 07:14.423
(man gasping and sobbing)

07:22.200 --> 07:25.704
- Do you have any regrets?

07:25.740 --> 07:28.675
- With every choice lies
the possibility of regret.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.718
However, if I choose
not to do something,

07:32.750 --> 07:34.809
it's usually for a good reason.

07:34.850 --> 07:38.741
- I'm...

07:38.790 --> 07:40.917
riddled with regrets.

07:43.530 --> 07:46.954
- A life without regret
would be no life at all.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.498
- I regret what I did
in the stable.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.805
- Then, you were lucky
I was there.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.973
- Oh, no, no, no.

08:03.010 --> 08:05.274
Being lucky

08:05.310 --> 08:08.746
isn't the same
as makIng a mistake.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.085
The mistake was allowing you

08:15.120 --> 08:17.088
to stop me.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.520
- So, it's not pulling
the trigger that you regret...

08:22.330 --> 08:25.094
...it's not pulling it
effectively.

08:28.070 --> 08:31.130
- That would be more accurate.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.036
- You must adapt your behaviour

08:36.080 --> 08:38.947
to avoid feeling
the same way again, Will.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.619
- Adapt.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.611
Evolve.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.129
Become.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.791
- Yes.

08:58.370 --> 09:01.931
I want you to close your eyes.

09:01.970 --> 09:04.939
Imagine a version of events
you wouldn't have regretted.

09:29.030 --> 09:31.590
What did you see?

09:34.400 --> 09:37.130
- A missed opportunity...

09:37.170 --> 09:40.833
to feel...

09:40.880 --> 09:44.873
like I felt when I killed
Garret Jacob Hobbs.

09:46.410 --> 09:50.016
To feel like...

09:52.150 --> 09:55.278
...like I felt when I thought
I'd killed you.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.196
- And what does that feel like?

10:02.230 --> 10:04.994
- I felt...

10:08.000 --> 10:11.834
...a quiet sense...

10:11.870 --> 10:13.838
of...

10:13.880 --> 10:16.644
power.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.376
- Good.

10:22.050 --> 10:24.985
Remember that feeling.

10:28.390 --> 10:30.426
- I tend to walk out
of this building

10:30.460 --> 10:32.826
in a very similar state.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.794
You must be a patient
of Dr. Lecter's.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.821
- I'm sorry?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.861
- You look familiar.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.868
I either know you

10:40.900 --> 10:42.868
or I know of you.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.208
- I'm the guy who didn't
kill all those people.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.816
- We all have a gauge
for humanity that twitches

10:57.850 --> 10:59.954
when we see other people.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.452
Tell me, Margot, what twitches
when you see your brother?

11:05.490 --> 11:08.027
- Not my gauge for humanity.

11:10.030 --> 11:14.831
- You don't recognize in
your brother basic human traits.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.838
You dehumanize him

11:16.870 --> 11:19.338
as much as he dehumanizes you.

11:19.370 --> 11:22.373
- At least, I'll never be
the worst person I know.

11:24.380 --> 11:28.009
- The tendency to
see others as less human
than ourselves IS universal.

11:28.050 --> 11:30.712
- My brother is less human.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.911
- And you are less human for it.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.713
- Did you just dehumanize me?

11:35.760 --> 11:37.819
- Psychiatrists

11:37.860 --> 11:39.487
who dehumanize patients
are more comfortable

11:39.530 --> 11:42.419
with painful
but effective treatments.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.992
- I met a patient of yours.
Will Graham.

11:48.870 --> 11:51.464
Wonder what sort of painful
but effective treatment

11:51.510 --> 11:54.172
you prescribed him?

11:54.210 --> 11:56.235
- What do you imagine?

11:56.280 --> 11:59.977
- You're very supportive
of me killing my brother.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.511
And I appreciate that support,

12:02.550 --> 12:04.745
I really do.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.008
But I can only imagine
what you'd be supportive

12:07.060 --> 12:09.187
of Will Graham doing.

12:09.220 --> 12:12.849
What kind of
psychiatrist are you?

12:12.900 --> 12:16.119
- You already had my reputation
and bona fides verified.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.958
You know what kind
of psychiatrist I am.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.860
- I'm beginning to.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.047
(camera clicking)

12:40.420 --> 12:43.025
- Since when the FBI

12:43.060 --> 12:44.925
get involved
in animal attacks, Jack?

12:44.960 --> 12:47.292
- When there's somebody
holding the leash

12:47.330 --> 12:49.298
of whatever it is
that's doing the killing.

12:49.330 --> 12:52.959
- Esophagus is destroyed. The
bite almost severed his head!

12:53.000 --> 12:56.538
- Whatever it was, it's not
afraid of humans. Not anymore.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.800
- So I'm thinking
a bear or a wolf.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.876
- Wolves or bears don't eat
where they kill.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.969
It'd have dragged him off.

13:03.010 --> 13:05.046
- There's no eating here.
We're gonna find everything.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.913
The viscera's exposed,
the belly's laid bare,

13:07.950 --> 13:10.885
but there's no sign
of rutting or gnawing, Jack.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.253
- A rabid animal attacks victims
at random and doesn't
eat any part of them.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.087
- Found the same wound patterns

13:16.120 --> 13:18.054
_ on a series of
livestock mutilations

13:18.090 --> 13:19.990
in the area. Evisceration,

13:20.030 --> 13:22.863
dismemberment,
yet everything accounted for.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.221
- Livestock mutilations. ..

13:25.270 --> 13:27.238
that was practice?

13:27.270 --> 13:30.433
- He's going to kill again.
He's gonna get better at it.

13:30.470 --> 13:33.303
- And he's urbanizing
his animal,

13:33.340 --> 13:36.468
moving it closer
to the city...

13:36.510 --> 13:40.241
adapting it for bigger prey.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.441
- And he's not denying
its natural instincts,

13:42.480 --> 13:45.608
he's evolving them.

13:45.650 --> 13:49.381
- It's blood sport.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.198
- A wolf or a bear?

14:11.110 --> 14:13.647
Oh...
(laughing)

14:13.680 --> 14:15.511
- Hey, hey, this is

14:15.550 --> 14:17.438
K-Kevin. Uh,

14:17.490 --> 14:19.412
try not to stare.

14:19.450 --> 14:22.214
They'll... Or they'll
take him away from me.

14:22.260 --> 14:25.184
- Oh, sorry.

14:25.230 --> 14:28.154
- It's OK.

14:35.970 --> 14:37.961
Bear. Wolf.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.638
- Do bears and wolves
hunt together?

14:41.680 --> 14:43.898
- Um, I mean, you could
you could train, train a bear

14:43.950 --> 14:46.339
to be a wolf,
or a wolf to be a bear.

14:46.380 --> 14:49.986
Train, train them long enough,
and they will hunt together,

14:50.020 --> 14:52.580
feed together.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.258
Hmm... OK.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.020
En-enough-enough

14:59.060 --> 15:02.621
time, there's,
there's a great deal

15:02.660 --> 15:06.118
I could train even you
to do, Will.

15:08.970 --> 15:11.530
- Hm.

15:13.610 --> 15:16.374
That kind of friendship can

15:16.410 --> 15:18.378
keep you on your toes.

15:18.410 --> 15:20.469
- Haha!

15:22.550 --> 15:24.939
Animals, they,
they do have...

15:24.990 --> 15:27.982
they have friendships
just-just like us.

15:31.990 --> 15:35.198
We're the same.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.161
- Yeah, I'll try
to remember that.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.702
- Please, don't-don't
blame-blame the animals.

15:47.740 --> 15:50.379
- No.
- Don't.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.469
Man is the only creature

15:52.510 --> 15:55.638
that kills to... kill.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.548
(metallic clapping)

16:14.170 --> 16:16.331
(stapling)

16:16.370 --> 16:19.009
(buzzing)

17:03.650 --> 17:06.118
- (woman): Oh, God!

17:06.150 --> 17:08.050
(indistinct talking)
(soft music playing)

17:08.090 --> 17:10.479
(woman laughing)

17:14.630 --> 17:16.450
(loud breathing)

17:18.470 --> 17:20.438
(servo-motor sound)

17:20.470 --> 17:22.734
(footsteps)

17:30.550 --> 17:32.506
- Argh!

17:34.520 --> 17:37.819
(screaming)
(servo-motor sounds)

18:44.490 --> 18:48.608
(deep breath)

18:55.930 --> 18:58.467
(heartbeat)

19:33.870 --> 19:36.259
(woman laughing)

19:54.290 --> 19:57.555
- Kill.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.828
(screaming)

20:22.680 --> 20:24.910
- It's not an animal.

20:24.950 --> 20:28.215
It's a man who wants
to be an animal.

20:32.860 --> 20:34.828
(Jack sighs.)

20:34.860 --> 20:36.828
- Does he believe
he's an animal?

20:36.860 --> 20:39.363
- It's not what he believes;
it's what he imagines.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.834
- (Jack): Well,
what does he want?

20:41.870 --> 20:44.259
- He wants to maul.

20:46.870 --> 20:50.033
Nothing personal about this.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.447
He doesn't know them.
He doesn't need to know them.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.812
They're just...

20:55.850 --> 20:57.818
meat to him.

20:57.850 --> 20:59.818
Prey.

20:59.850 --> 21:02.353
- This kind of psychosis

21:02.390 --> 21:04.381
doesn't just slip
through the system.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.354
Somewhere, someone
would have noticed this.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.459
he got inside
of it somehow,

21:11.500 --> 21:13.866
tamed it,

21:13.900 --> 21:17.666
made a suit out of it.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.304
He's an engineer...

21:20.340 --> 21:22.638
or he understands engineering.

21:24.610 --> 21:28.011
He knows how to build.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.712
He built his beast.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.480
He is a student
of predators.

21:51.470 --> 21:53.734
- (Hannibal): "No beast
is more savage than man

21:53.780 --> 21:56.772
when possessed with power
answerable to his own rage."

21:56.810 --> 21:58.778
- It's not rage.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.608
Rage is an emotional response

22:01.650 --> 22:04.084
to being provoked.
This is something else.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.419
- What is it?

22:07.460 --> 22:09.451
- Instinct.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.996
It's the way he thinks.
- The way any animal thinks

22:14.030 --> 22:17.693
depends on limitations
of mind and body.

22:17.730 --> 22:21.632
_ If we learn
our limitations too soon,

22:21.670 --> 22:24.104
we never learn our power.

22:24.140 --> 22:27.837
- His victims are torn apart;
I'd say he learned his power.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.475
- He claimed his power.

22:31.510 --> 22:33.774
Can you imagine
tearing someone apart?

22:35.720 --> 22:38.689
Or would you prefer
to use a gun?

22:38.720 --> 22:41.848
- Guns lack intimacy.

22:41.890 --> 22:44.586
- You set an event in motion

22:44.630 --> 22:46.586
with a gun;
you don't complete it.

22:48.930 --> 22:51.023
with your hands.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.937
Wouldn't that be more satisfying
than pulling a trigger?

22:56.600 --> 22:59.068
- Yes.

23:02.610 --> 23:04.942
- When you sent
the man to kill me,

23:04.980 --> 23:08.438
were you imagining
killing me yourself?

23:08.480 --> 23:11.517
Living vicariously
through him as if...

23:11.550 --> 23:15.657
your hands tightened
the noose around my neck?

23:15.690 --> 23:18.079
Or were you simply hiding?

23:21.030 --> 23:23.055
- I wasn't hiding from
anything the first time

23:23.100 --> 23:26.820
I tried to kill you.
- You were hiding...

23:26.870 --> 23:29.998
behind the gun.

23:35.940 --> 23:39.444
You must allow yourself to
be intimate with your
instincts, Will.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.814
- The closest comparative
bite radius we could match

23:48.860 --> 23:51.078
to the victims' wounds
is a cave bear.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.496
- Even the dire wolf,
which is the largest species

23:53.530 --> 23:55.828
of the genus Canis,
is itty-bitty by comparison.

23:55.860 --> 23:57.794
- But a cave bear
did not do this.

23:57.830 --> 23:59.866
- Mostly because
they're vegetarian,

23:59.900 --> 24:01.891
and have been extinct
for 28,000 years.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.728
- Mostly because the bite force
relative to the skull size

24:05.770 --> 24:07.909
doesn't match the kind of damage
we've been seeing.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.669
- What could?

24:09.710 --> 24:11.940
- Pull-ratchets
and pneumatics, maybe.

24:11.980 --> 24:14.972
- Pretty sophisticated ingenuity
for any kind of animal,

24:15.020 --> 24:17.113
_man or beast.
- Animals are far more

24:17.150 --> 24:20.119
like humans _than
we ever realized.

24:20.150 --> 24:22.516
And humans are far more
like animals.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.585
One thin barrier between us.

24:24.630 --> 24:28.589
- And for some,
that barrier is way too thin.

24:28.630 --> 24:32.191
Hello, Dr. Lecter.

24:32.230 --> 24:36.064
How does something
like this present?

24:36.100 --> 24:39.137
- Someone affected by this kind
of species dysphoria

24:39.170 --> 24:41.707
typically has
other conditions.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.742
Mood disorders,

24:43.780 --> 24:45.873
clinical depression,

24:45.910 --> 24:48.674
schizophrenia.
- Typically?

24:48.720 --> 24:51.541
- They may not
present at all.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.239
Your killer could have
built a bridge between

24:53.290 --> 24:55.952
who he appears to be and
what he now knows he's become.

24:55.990 --> 24:57.821
- He didn't build
a bridge, Doctor...

24:57.860 --> 25:00.556
he built a suit.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.660
- What he seeks
is transformation.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.662
- Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

25:16.940 --> 25:18.908
- This threatens
to be a violation of

25:18.950 --> 25:21.817
doctor-patient confidentiality,
so I will thread carefully.

25:21.850 --> 25:24.080
- You've _seen _
something like this?

25:24.120 --> 25:27.214
- Years ago, I treated a patient
who fits the profile.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.855
A teenage boy who suffered

25:29.890 --> 25:32.825
from what I would describe
as an identity disorder.

25:32.860 --> 25:36.557
- This boy fancied
himself a beast?

25:36.600 --> 25:40.764
- During our therapy,
he reported a moment of clarity.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.166
He understood in that moment,
he was an animal

25:43.200 --> 25:47.159
born in the body of a man.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.178
He kept a solitary life.

25:49.210 --> 25:52.998
He would hide and behave in ways
resembling animal behaviour.

25:53.050 --> 25:55.769
- He was delusional.
- Not necessarily.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.981
He didn't believe metamorphosis

25:58.020 --> 26:00.011
could physically take place,

26:00.050 --> 26:02.052
but that wouldn't stop him
from trying to achieve it.

26:04.060 --> 26:06.585
- He'd be a grown man now?

26:06.630 --> 26:10.350
- And as he grew
in wisdom and confidence,

26:10.400 --> 26:13.597
he would no longer feel he had
to meet his needs in hiding.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.131
- What are his needs,
Dr. Lecter?

26:16.170 --> 26:20.004
- Savagery.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.841
(footsteps)

26:34.790 --> 26:37.315
- Museum's closed.

26:46.730 --> 26:50.598
- Hello, Randall.

26:53.270 --> 26:55.272
- Dr. Lecter.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.078
- You will always be ruled

27:00.110 --> 27:02.772
by your fascination with teeth.

27:05.050 --> 27:07.416
- That's what you said to me
when they brought in your office

27:07.450 --> 27:09.657
the very first time.

27:09.690 --> 27:12.352
- Is that what I said?

27:12.390 --> 27:14.358
- Yeah.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.790
I was crying.

27:17.830 --> 27:21.288
I was dreading telling you
what was wrong with me and...

27:21.340 --> 27:24.867
you made it easier.

27:24.910 --> 27:28.630
Other visits too.

27:30.440 --> 27:34.115
- A therapist's life is equal
parts counsel and curiosity.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.111
We set a patient on a path,

27:38.150 --> 27:40.118
but are left to wonder
where that path

27:40.150 --> 27:42.812
will take them.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.719
You've come
so very far, Randall.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.823
- A long time
since you treated me.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.796
- Which is why I wanted
to talk to you

27:56.840 --> 27:58.831
about your wonderful progress,

27:58.870 --> 28:01.737
just for a moment, privately.

28:05.210 --> 28:08.179
I've seen what you've done.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.818
- What have I done?

28:12.850 --> 28:16.809
- You bore screams...

28:16.860 --> 28:20.796
like a sculptor bears dust
from the beaten stone.

28:23.400 --> 28:27.268
That crying boy doesn't
cling to you anymore.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.436
What clings to you now?

28:33.910 --> 28:36.435
What clings to your teeth?

28:40.510 --> 28:42.842
- Ragged bits of scalp...

28:44.850 --> 28:49.389
...trailing their tails of hair
like comets.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.455
- Beautiful.

28:55.930 --> 28:57.966
They are looking for you.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.538
- I don't think I can stop.

29:01.570 --> 29:04.107
- I don't want you to.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.267
But they will
find you, Randall.

29:08.510 --> 29:10.808
When they do,

29:10.850 --> 29:13.842
it's important you do
exactly what I say.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.468
- You wanted to speak to me?

29:34.500 --> 29:36.468
- Ah, Randall Tier.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.468
Special Agent Jack
Crawford with the FBI.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.933
This is Will Graham.

29:40.980 --> 29:45.076
Uh... did you...
put all that together?

29:45.110 --> 29:48.511
- Yes, I did.
- Nice work.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.508
What is that?

29:53.550 --> 29:57.486
- That is a cave bear.
- You put together a lot
of cave bears, do you?

29:57.520 --> 30:00.921
- Yeah. I put them together,
take them apart, put them
back together again.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.428
- You understand their_mechanics
and how they're engineered?

30:03.460 --> 30:06.429
- We understand a lot about
cave bears. Their fossils

30:06.470 --> 30:10.099
have been found in the tens of
thousands, all over southern
Europe. Very common.

30:10.140 --> 30:13.132
- The reason I ask
is because a...

30:13.170 --> 30:16.230
a cave bear skull

30:16.280 --> 30:18.407
was used recently
as a murder weapon.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.441
- Prehistoric jaws and claws

30:20.480 --> 30:22.448
are designed to do
what they do best.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.540
- The victims were torn apart.

30:27.420 --> 30:29.911
Used the right tool
for the job.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.951
- Well, look inside the skull

30:31.990 --> 30:34.458
and you'll find what the job is.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.129
- You have a history of trouble
with things inside your head.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.161
Isn't that right, Mr. Tier?

30:42.500 --> 30:44.536
- Is that what this is about?

30:46.540 --> 30:48.838
You think I killed
someone with a fossil?

30:51.210 --> 30:55.214
I had an identity disorder.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.571
The doctors told me
the internal map

30:57.620 --> 31:00.180
of my body didn't
match reality.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.211
Do you know what it's like

31:02.260 --> 31:04.228
when the skin you're wearing
doesn't fit?

31:04.260 --> 31:08.959
- I can imagine.
- I know who I am now.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.163
And I'm doing much better.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.135
I'm socializing.
I take my medication.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.365
I'm employed. And I work

31:17.400 --> 31:20.267
very hard.

31:20.310 --> 31:22.403
And I'm proof that
mental illness is treatable.

31:29.950 --> 31:32.282
(dogs barking)

31:38.090 --> 31:41.651
- Shh, shh.
(dogs stop barking)

31:41.700 --> 31:44.225
- Hi.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.067
_ I don't know
if you remember me,

31:46.100 --> 31:48.933
but I met you outside
of Dr. Lecter's office.

31:48.970 --> 31:52.007
- I remember it.
How did you find me?

31:52.040 --> 31:55.271
- Well, as it turns out,
you are famous.

31:55.310 --> 31:57.198
- Uh...

31:57.240 --> 32:00.505
You're not exactly anonymous
yourself, Margot.

32:00.550 --> 32:03.144
- Did you, uh, sneak a peek
inside Dr. Lecter's calendar?

32:05.290 --> 32:07.645
- Yeah, it is
exactly what I did.

32:11.290 --> 32:14.521
- It's cold.
Do you have any whiskey?

32:21.440 --> 32:24.603
- What is the heir to the Verger
Meat Packing dynasty

32:24.640 --> 32:27.234
doing at my door?

32:27.270 --> 32:29.272
- Oh, my brother is the heir,

32:29.310 --> 32:31.449
not me.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.711
I have the wrong parts and
the wrong proclivity for parts.

32:39.650 --> 32:43.051
- You didn't answer my question.

32:43.090 --> 32:46.287
- Came for
a character reference.

32:46.330 --> 32:49.424
Patient to patient.

32:49.460 --> 32:52.099
What do you think
of Dr. Lecter's therapy?

32:54.100 --> 32:56.694
- It depends what
you're in therapy for.

32:56.740 --> 33:00.232
- Oh, I'm in therapy
for all kinds of reasons.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.103
The Vergers slaughter
86,000 cattle a day

33:03.140 --> 33:05.108
and 36,000 pigs,

33:05.150 --> 33:07.778
depending on the season,

33:07.810 --> 33:10.119
but that's just
the public carnage.

33:10.150 --> 33:14.109
- What's your private carnage?

33:14.160 --> 33:17.709
- I tried to kill my brother.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.420
- Well, I assume
he had it coming.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.060
- Did he ever.

33:31.540 --> 33:34.668
What's your private carnage?

33:39.480 --> 33:42.244
- I tried to murder Dr. Lecter.

33:44.150 --> 33:46.141
- Did he have it coming?

33:49.460 --> 33:52.759
- What do you think?

33:52.790 --> 33:55.827
- I can't say that I know.

33:55.860 --> 33:58.829
- Neither can I.

33:58.870 --> 34:03.830
- We_have _some
very Similar issues.

34:03.870 --> 34:07.203
Although I doubt
that Dr. Lecter

34:07.240 --> 34:10.129
gave you the same advice
on murder that he gave me.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.671
- And what's that?

34:12.710 --> 34:15.178
- He said...

34:15.220 --> 34:17.176
"If at first
you don't succeed,

34:17.220 --> 34:19.518
try, try again."

34:30.900 --> 34:33.460
- I'm curious what would happen

34:33.500 --> 34:36.663
if your patients started
comparing notes, Dr. Lecter.

34:38.670 --> 34:41.639
What would Randall Tier
have to say to me?

34:41.680 --> 34:44.604
- What did Randall Tier
say to you?

34:44.650 --> 34:48.211
- He said he was
much better now,

34:48.250 --> 34:50.445
that mental illness
was treatable.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.381
Randall Tier is a success story.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.456
- You believe
he's innocent?

34:55.490 --> 34:58.220
- I believe...

34:58.260 --> 35:01.252
your therapy was successful.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.497
You can be persuasive.

35:07.930 --> 35:10.797
How many have there been?

35:10.840 --> 35:13.900
Like Randall Tier?

35:13.940 --> 35:16.579
Like me?

35:18.450 --> 35:20.577
- Every patient is unique.

35:24.620 --> 35:27.612
- Your psychiatrist came
to visit me

35:27.650 --> 35:30.414
at the hospital before my trial.

35:33.630 --> 35:35.598
- Dr. Du Maurier.

35:35.630 --> 35:37.825
- She told me she believed me.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.360
She knew there were
others like me.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.366
- Fascinating.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.901
- Did you kill her?

35:48.940 --> 35:51.374
- No.

36:00.420 --> 36:04.186
- What do you think about
when you think about killing?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.389
- I think about God.

36:12.430 --> 36:15.968
- Good and evil?

36:16.000 --> 36:19.561
- Good and evil has
nothing to do with God.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.447
I collect church collapses.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.903
Did you see the recent one
in Sicily?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.616
The facade fell
on 65 grandmothers

36:31.650 --> 36:33.789
during a special mass.

36:36.490 --> 36:39.618
Was that evil? Was that God?

36:41.630 --> 36:43.598
If he's up there,

36:43.630 --> 36:45.666
he just loves it.

36:47.900 --> 36:50.266
Typhoid and swans,

36:50.300 --> 36:52.439
it all comes
from the same place.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.805
- Does Randall Tier
believe in God?

37:02.980 --> 37:05.710
- Perhaps you should have
a more personal conversation

37:05.750 --> 37:09.311
with Mr. Tier
and ask him what he believes.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.742
The solitude of what you do
is to be respected,

37:40.790 --> 37:43.315
and I intend to honour that.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.624
I've only come to offer
words of encouragement.

37:47.630 --> 37:51.327
You are becoming, Randall,

37:51.370 --> 37:53.759
and this beast
is your higher self.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.291
Your bodies, voices,

37:56.340 --> 37:58.331
and wills are one.

38:00.510 --> 38:02.831
Revel in what you are.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.958
(dogs barking)

38:23.760 --> 38:26.866
(dog yelping)

38:26.900 --> 38:29.664
- Hey!
(dog barking)

38:32.570 --> 38:35.573
Buster! Buster!

38:35.610 --> 38:37.874
(dogs barking)

39:23.490 --> 39:25.720
(dog whimpering)

39:30.100 --> 39:32.364
- Oh, shh, shh.

39:52.620 --> 39:55.817
(branch cracking)

40:23.920 --> 40:26.013
(dogs barking)

40:26.050 --> 40:29.156
(Will panting)

40:46.870 --> 40:49.202
(dog yelping)

41:52.340 --> 41:54.535
I'd say this makes us even.

41:57.810 --> 42:00.938
I sent someone to kill you...

42:00.980 --> 42:02.971
you sent someone to kill me.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.812
Even Steven.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.668
