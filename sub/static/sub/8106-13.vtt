WEBVTT

00:08.467 --> 00:13.054
Wait. We shouldn't...
We shouldn't be doing this.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.015
What? You're not having fun?

00:16.558 --> 00:18.226
It's not that. I just...

00:18.352 --> 00:20.019
Rather be with the boys?

00:20.771 --> 00:22.397
No.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.273
Well, then come on.

00:37.329 --> 00:38.538
You kids need any help?

00:38.664 --> 00:39.956
No. No, we're fine.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.582
Car trouble?

00:41.709 --> 00:42.542
No.

00:42.668 --> 00:43.918
Then why are you here?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.878
We're just talking.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.965
Does she do all the talking?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.717
Most of it.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.929
I know what that's like.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.182
I'm gonna come back
through here in 10 minutes,

00:58.308 --> 01:01.978
and if you're still here,
I'm gonna call your parents.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.440
Yes, sir. Thank you.

01:13.866 --> 01:16.200
Now, where were we?

01:16.326 --> 01:18.161
We were going.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.829
In nine minutes.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.556
Wait...

01:38.682 --> 01:40.141
Stevie? What's wrong?

01:46.231 --> 01:47.523
Oh, my God!

01:50.444 --> 01:53.196
Help! Someone help me!

03:32.004 --> 03:34.630
Sixteen-year-old
with respiratory arrest.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.717
The only thing I hate more
than a thief is a crippled thief.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.719
Yeah, me, too.
No sign of trauma, no history

03:39.845 --> 03:41.512
- of asthma or...
- Who the hell is J. Whitner?

03:41.680 --> 03:45.850
No idea. Stevie Lipa's EKG
and echocardiogram were normal, but...

03:45.976 --> 03:48.144
Normal is good. Send him home.

03:48.270 --> 03:52.523
J. Whitner, doctor. Who is he,
and where do I find him?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.609
She's the new researcher,
works with Ereshevsky.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.402
- Is she hot?
- She's in a wheelchair.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.612
Doesn't mean she's not hot.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.238
Just means
she can't bend over,

03:59.364 --> 04:01.324
so Cuddy has to
bend over backwards.

04:01.450 --> 04:06.162
Sixteen-year-old kid. ER workup revealed
a bloody pleural effusion.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.915
- That's odd.
- Yeah, that occurred to me.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.666
What took you so long
to mention it?

04:10.792 --> 04:12.668
No tumors or pneumonia
on the CT.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.004
He passed out
while making out.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.924
If he's into sex, drugs and rock
and roll can't be that far behind.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.216
I'm guessing cocaine.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.468
Tox screen was clean.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.054
Just means he wasn't on drugs,
not that he hasn't been using drugs.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.973
Looks like a plumbing problem
to me. Leaky pipes.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.392
If he popped an aneurysm,
he'd be in the morgue, not the ER.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.895
That's why you're gonna do a venogram
instead of an arteriogram.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.397
This is not a high-pressure burst.
It's a low-pressure leak.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.233
Still could've been drugs that caused
the pipes to corrode in the first place.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.693
So go look under his mattress.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.821
See if he's got any pills or powder
stashed with the hand lotion.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.633
Sweet ride. I asked for the one
with the sissy bar and the banana seat,

05:00.759 --> 05:05.012
but Santa gave me this instead. Guess
that's what I get for being naughty.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.682
You must be Dr. House.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.641
Yeah.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.311
So looks like there's been some sort
of mix-up at the parking office.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.146
They had to move me closer
to the door.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.858
Had to? You don't look like
the type to pull a weapon.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.694
- Wheelchair.
- Cane.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.322
I think you should do the honorable
thing and let me have my space back.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.617
Oh, well,
since you asked so nicely, wheelchair.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.997
Cane. Walking long distances
makes my leg hurt.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.623
And it's easy for me?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.042
Of course not.
Pushing that little lever?

05:35.168 --> 05:39.296
The muscles must burn. I'm sure
the last 10 yards are pure torture.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.590
Crossing the parking lot is dangerous.
Cars can't see me.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.010
You ever hit a patch
of black ice with a cane?

05:44.136 --> 05:47.722
No, gosh, on account of the fact
that I can't walk.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.683
Maybe you should ask the parking office
for some crampons.

05:50.809 --> 05:55.688
This is about who can most easily cross
the parking lot. You're the winner.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.899
Oh, and the prize
is apparently a parking space.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.287
There's still no answer at either
one of your parent's cell numbers.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.622
Is there any other way
we might be able to contact them?

06:13.749 --> 06:17.209
No, they're in a conference.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.462
They probably had
to turn them off or something.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.797
What does it matter where they are?
I mean, he's in pain.

06:21.923 --> 06:22.965
You gotta do something.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.216
We need them to sign this.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.427
Why can't he just
sign the papers? He's 16.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.928
Still not an adult.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.848
Then call my parents. They know him,
and they'll take responsibility,

06:30.974 --> 06:32.475
- do whatever you need.
- I can't. It won't...

06:32.601 --> 06:35.269
You can't just let him sit here in agony
until his parents finally decide...

06:35.395 --> 06:37.354
Leah, it's okay.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.440
No, it's not.

06:41.485 --> 06:44.862
I feel like there's an anvil
sitting on my chest.

07:02.089 --> 07:07.134
You win. I'm doing the venogram now.
We'll deal with the fallout later.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.106
My fingers feel wet.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.566
That's just the dye.
Your nerves can't tell the difference

07:22.692 --> 07:25.111
between the cold inside your body
and the wet outside your body.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.321
The nerves can't tell the difference,

07:27.447 --> 07:29.782
or the brain can't interpret
the difference?

07:29.908 --> 07:32.952
A little of both.
You like science?

07:37.833 --> 07:40.042
Looks like
a diffusion pattern.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.711
That's because it's
the venous side. Low pressure.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.839
So Graham's law applies.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.633
You've taken physics already?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.427
No, I just sort of
read up on my own.

07:50.554 --> 07:54.098
I had to teach myself a lot of stuff,
too. Schools sucked where I grew up.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.142
You go to public or private?

07:56.268 --> 07:57.184
Public.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.189
Leak has to be in the pulmonary veins
to get in my lungs, right?

08:02.315 --> 08:03.357
Yep.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.192
I don't see anything. Do you?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.777
No.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.612
It doesn't make sense.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.616
How can I have a bloody effusion
without any bleeding?

08:30.552 --> 08:32.469
This is putrid.

08:32.596 --> 08:36.473
Put food-borne parasites and infections
on the list to check on.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.060
I'll take the bedroom.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.575
Oh. Sorry, I didn't know
there was anyone.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.786
- We were just...
- Oh, God! I have a gun.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.207
Look, you can take whatever you want.
My wallet's in my suit.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.791
Freeze! Freeze!

09:02.918 --> 09:04.126
I'm calling the cops.

09:04.252 --> 09:08.380
Okay, you don't have a gun,
and you're not calling the cops.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.217
Oh, no, I'm calling the cops unless
you two get out of here right now.

09:11.343 --> 09:15.596
"Unless"? Who calls the cops
unless a burglar does something?

09:19.851 --> 09:21.602
You don't want to
have to explain the affair.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.978
We're not having an affair.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.482
He's got a ring. You don't.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.776
And judging from the state
of the kitchen downstairs

09:28.902 --> 09:31.320
and the half-vacuumed bedroom,

09:31.446 --> 09:34.156
I'm guessing you're a better lover
than you are a maid.

09:34.282 --> 09:38.118
Maid? You son of a bitch.

09:38.245 --> 09:42.248
I'm not a maid, okay?
This is my house, not his.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.709
- Sorry.
- And what's wrong with my kitchen?

09:45.835 --> 09:49.255
Nothing. We're sorry.
We're just here to help Stevie.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.757
Who's Stevie?

09:51.883 --> 09:53.509
Your son?

09:57.555 --> 09:59.306
It was the address you gave.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.849
The ER must have
written it down wrong.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.227
Or you lied because you don't want us
to talk to your parents.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.687
I gave you their
phone numbers.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.481
You gave us some numbers.
We haven't been able to reach anyone.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.191
I told you,
they must be in a conference.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.776
- He's lying.
- Leah.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.989
He's Romany, a Gypsy.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.617
So you don't have a home?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.244
Of course we do.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.247
What, next you're gonna ask me
about dancing around campfires

10:23.373 --> 10:26.875
and stealing children?
This is why I don't tell people.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.460
They share everything with each other

10:28.586 --> 10:31.505
and nothing with the gadje,
the outsiders.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.884
Sharing information with outsiders
has not gone so well for my people.

10:36.928 --> 10:40.055
Right now you're making yourself
more vulnerable by lying to us.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.434
You can't go to my house.
You'll pollute it.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.768
All we're gonna do
is look around.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.353
Your presence is enough.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.567
My parents take it seriously.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.819
It's spiritual
as much as it is physical.

10:53.945 --> 10:54.987
You know where he lives?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.447
Don't.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.407
Look, I'll tell you
whatever you need to know.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.700
If we can't
trust your answers...

10:59.826 --> 11:02.995
I drink sometimes, okay?
I've smoked pot.

11:03.121 --> 11:06.749
I'll tell you anything,
the truth. You just...

11:08.585 --> 11:10.336
You can't go in my home.

11:12.255 --> 11:16.091
The pot wouldn't cause a bleeding
problem. A pesticide on the pot could.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.093
Where did you get it?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.303
Some kid at school.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.597
Stevie. He got the pot from me.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.682
He doesn't even go to school.
His parents made him drop out.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.893
- I'm home-schooled.
- He reads books.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.646
What else are you lying about?
Is your father really a professor?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.357
He's a salesman.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.859
They buy and sell anything
they can get their hands on.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.445
They? So you're with your dad
when he's making these deals?

11:36.571 --> 11:38.781
He was just in Chicago
a week ago.

11:38.907 --> 11:42.993
- You fly?
- No, my dad's got a truck.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.210
You can't be serious.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.336
Actually, I can.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.382
See? It's my space.
I want it back.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.009
It's not your space.
It's the hospital's space,

11:59.135 --> 12:02.221
and the hospital thinks
that the person who's worse off

12:02.347 --> 12:04.056
should get the better space.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.267
Your application for a handicap space
says you can walk 50 yards.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.686
And Whitner's says
she can roll 50 miles

12:09.813 --> 12:12.022
between oil changes.
I can't change my leg.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.609
The space I moved you to is only
46 yards away from the front door.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.236
- I measured. You'll be fine.
- Great.

12:17.362 --> 12:21.407
So I can collapse four yards into the
lobby instead of outside in the cold.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.200
- As long as it's not in my office.
- Do you know who won

12:23.326 --> 12:27.329
the New York City Marathon
six years in a row? Guy in a wheelchair.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.331
Then go get yourself one,
and leave me alone.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.792
Give me my space,
I'll be happy to roll around all day.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.087
You couldn't last one week
in a wheelchair.

12:35.839 --> 12:36.672
Wanna bet?

12:41.553 --> 12:42.553
What's wrong with you?

12:42.679 --> 12:45.139
Nothing that a week off
my feet won't solve.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.765
Venogram's negative. No leak.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.016
You mean you couldn't
find the leak.

12:48.143 --> 12:48.976
Is your leg worse?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.478
No, my parking spot is.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.022
Blood is only made inside
the circulatory system,

12:54.149 --> 12:56.108
- which means when we find it outside...
- There's no leak.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.776
- I even checked lymphatics.
- So you're gonna spend a week

12:57.902 --> 13:00.320
in a wheelchair just to get a
parking space closer to the front door?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.030
Easier than chopping off my legs.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.407
We've ruled out toxins
and drugs.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.286
Kind of. He's Romany. Apparently,
they feel the need to keep secrets,

13:07.412 --> 13:08.996
so it's hard to know
anything for sure.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.581
Yeah, he's also a human being,

13:10.707 --> 13:12.458
which means you shouldn't be
trusting him to begin with.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.877
Stop relying on his answers
and find some on your own.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.462
It's a deep-vein thrombosis.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.298
The kid spent 16 hours
in the back seat of an old pick-up.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.258
Causes a clot,
makes its way to his lungs.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.760
We should do an arteriogram,
find the clot, bust it with TPA.

13:23.887 --> 13:24.845
Or we can find the leak.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.221
There's no leak.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.808
Hey, you can't yell at a guy
in a wheelchair.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.687
This is a slow leak.
You've got to speed it up.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.314
Thin his blood.
Redo the venogram.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.107
That could cause
a massive bleed.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.693
Excellent.
Massive will be even easier to find.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.155
Pardon me. I guess you guys
are gonna have to get the next one.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.369
I thought you were
redoing the venogram.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.330
As soon as we're done
with the arteriogram.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.209
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little poke.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.630
Can you maybe do that?

13:59.756 --> 14:02.257
Don't worry. It's just your leg. I don't
have to go any further than this.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.427
Take a look at this,
bones of your forearm.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.262
Radius and ulna.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.472
How about the wrist?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.685
Lunate, hamate, the...

14:14.270 --> 14:17.481
"Scared lovers try positions
they can't handle."

14:20.485 --> 14:24.196
It's a mnemonic for the wrist bones.
It's the only way I can remember them.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.998
You okay?

14:36.459 --> 14:38.293
- My stomach.
- Did you hit something?

14:38.419 --> 14:40.212
- I barely started.
- Lie flat.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.339
- No, I can't. It hurts too much.
- I'm getting out.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.882
It's our only chance
to see what's going on.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.759
If he moves,
I could shred his artery.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.718
Get it out now!

14:46.844 --> 14:49.846
It's gonna be okay, Stevie.
Just inject the dye.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.685
Dye's going into his liver,
but it's not coming out.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.020
Clot's gotta be constricting
the flow in the hepatic vein.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.398
It's not constricting it.
It's completely blocking it.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.857
His whole liver's fried.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.037
The kid's liver's failing
because of a massive clot

15:14.163 --> 15:16.957
that's blocking his hepatic vein.
How can he have both a bleed and a clot?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.625
It's not a clot.
You must have blocked the vein

15:18.751 --> 15:20.502
- with a catheter wire.
- Not a chance.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.629
Increased pressure downstream
could also stop the blood.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.090
There's no heart failure or cirrhosis.
Means it has to be a clot.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.677
Massive clots block veins.
They don't make them leak.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.680
And since he clearly
has some kind of...

15:31.806 --> 15:34.057
You having a little problem?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.100
Would you mind?

15:38.354 --> 15:41.940
Boy, that was humiliating. How
does Whitner make it through the day?

15:42.066 --> 15:44.401
"Pride goeth before the fall."

15:44.527 --> 15:47.654
Lucky for me,
I'm sitting in one of these babies.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.948
So what other theories
can I shoot down?

15:50.074 --> 15:51.116
DIC would explain both the...

15:51.242 --> 15:53.619
His platelets are normal,
and his PTT isn't elevated.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.455
- Leukemia?
- Normal CBC, and differential?

15:56.581 --> 16:00.000
You guys are thinking like doctors when
you should be thinking like plumbers.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.127
Come on, I wanna see
some butt crack.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.921
Something inside the liver
is punching holes in the pipes.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.633
Blood bleeds through the opening,
sticks to the intruder, forms a mass.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.384
- A clot.
- A mass.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.511
Cancer? A tumor could
erode a blood vessel.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.306
Well, so could a granuloma
from tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.726
Do a CT, MRI,
sputum and ACE level.

16:17.852 --> 16:21.021
Excuse me. Sorry.
Cripple coming through.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.029
He says his throat hurts.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.324
That phrasing means
you think it doesn't.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.950
No, I don't.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.039
- Good enough for me.
- Where are you going?

16:39.165 --> 16:42.250
Mothers know best.
Get yourself a sucker on the way out.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.379
Look, I think he's just faking
so he doesn't have to go to school.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.547
How did you know
I was a truant officer?

16:47.674 --> 16:50.467
I told him he had a choice,
go to school or the doctor.

16:50.593 --> 16:54.596
Right. He's wasting your precious time,
so you decided to waste mine.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.056
How thoughtful.

16:59.102 --> 17:02.187
I'm in a wheelchair, so I can't
examine him all the way up there.

17:02.313 --> 17:06.233
Hop down. My life is just
one horror after another.

17:07.235 --> 17:08.735
Open.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.237
Does it look like it hurts?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.363
No.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.290
What's that?

17:22.417 --> 17:24.334
Syringe. I'm with you.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.379
Make him hate the doctor's office
more than he hates school.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.548
That's okay.
I don't think that's...

17:29.674 --> 17:30.632
It's just saline.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.719
Hurts like hell when it's injected
directly into the muscle.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.095
So what do you think,
arm or ass?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.513
I think he's
learned his lesson.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.182
Oh, I don't know.
We better check.

17:39.308 --> 17:44.020
Jack, is your mommy a big,
fat idiot?

17:45.523 --> 17:48.066
Well, what do you know?
I guess you were right.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.824
Just hold still, Stevie.
This shouldn't take long.

17:56.617 --> 18:00.203
Sorry, I'm guessing the mike
in this thing doesn't pick up nods.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.580
Smart kid.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.248
Too bad it's all
gonna go to waste.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.708
Nothing wrong
with being a salesman.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.501
He should be able to
pursue his own life,

18:06.627 --> 18:09.045
not be stuck helping his parents
sell old toasters.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.423
He's still young. You never know
what he'll end up doing.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.801
Unless he goes back to school,
I know exactly what he'll end up doing.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.513
Wait. A lesion?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.433
Magnifying times five.

18:21.559 --> 18:22.768
It's a granuloma.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.603
It means Wegener's
is the most likely.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.732
- Stevie!
- Mom, is that you?

18:29.609 --> 18:30.817
Get him out of this now.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.235
Your son is sick.
The sign on the door...

18:32.361 --> 18:33.987
The sign says, "No metal."
We took everything off.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.072
It says, "No admittance."

18:36.574 --> 18:38.325
- What's wrong with our son?
- We don't know yet.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.911
He's not gonna die, is he?

18:42.580 --> 18:45.457
Your son is very ill.
We're still trying to figure out why,

18:45.583 --> 18:48.251
which is why
we need you to leave the room.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.522
What are you gonna do now?

19:08.648 --> 19:12.567
Oh, now I've got to slide my butt
from one padded seat to another.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.778
What if I bump my knee?

19:15.947 --> 19:17.948
MRI showed
a granuloma in his liver.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.658
Fantastic.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.661
- Wanna give me a hand here?
- No.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.080
Clotting, bleeding and a granuloma
equals Wegener's.

19:25.206 --> 19:28.124
I know. That's why I said fantastic.
I was being sincere.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.085
- Now, give me a hand.
- Wouldn't be fair.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.878
We're gonna biopsy
the liver to confirm.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.255
Wouldn't be fair not to.

19:33.381 --> 19:37.050
People are good and kind and gentle
and help people in wheelchairs.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.802
- You don't believe that.
- But you do.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.637
No, I don't.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.807
Foreman, forget the biopsy.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.684
His liver will be gone
before you get the results.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.269
Start treatment
with cyclophosphamide

19:47.395 --> 19:50.897
before the Wegener's
punches a hole in another pipe.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.093
What's with the clothes?
You're not being discharged.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.928
I know.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.224
It's my parents.
They insist that I wear this stuff.

20:26.350 --> 20:30.103
We insist on our own food,
gown and furnishings for a reason.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.107
Hey, my chest burns.
Are you sure the treatments are working?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.443
Wegener's causes the body
to attack itself.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.862
That doesn't get undone
overnight. Be patient.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.364
- Where's your soup?
- It's in the garbage.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.741
It has willow-bark extract.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.826
Willow-bark extract
is basically aspirin.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.286
Yes, for the fever.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.413
He's already on meds,
our meds.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.166
We can't risk any
adverse interactions.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.585
We need all this stuff to go.
We need to control this environment.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.171
So do we. People get sick
for a reason,

20:56.297 --> 20:57.923
'cause something in their life
is out of balance.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.092
Dad, he's a doctor.
He doesn't want to hear your talk.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.262
Balance is just starting to be restored
now that that girl is gone.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.640
That girl took pretty good care
of your son while you were away.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.725
Yes, we can see that.

21:08.851 --> 21:11.603
Look, all this stuff may make him feel
more comfortable, but it's not gonna...

21:11.729 --> 21:12.812
How long is this treatment
gonna take?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.397
We should start to see
some improvement

21:14.523 --> 21:15.440
in his liver function soon.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.109
Soon. Very scientific.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.074
I'm sorry.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.166
I'll be back in a little bit
to check on you.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.633
Ah, yes, if it isn't
Dr. Ironside.

21:41.759 --> 21:44.970
Ah, if it isn't Dr. "I Had No Friends
When I Was Growing Up,

21:45.096 --> 21:46.763
"So All I Did Was Watch TV
by Myself,

21:46.889 --> 21:49.265
"Which Is Why I Can Now Make
Constant Pop-Culture References

21:49.392 --> 21:51.184
"Which No One Understands
but Me."

21:51.310 --> 21:53.561
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.901
Safe from Cuddy, but I guess not
from her trusted rat-complice.

22:00.027 --> 22:03.405
Reasonable people don't debate
the relative merits of their handicaps.

22:03.531 --> 22:06.324
Reasonable people
make rules based on evidence,

22:06.450 --> 22:08.660
like difficulty
covering a distance,

22:08.786 --> 22:12.330
say, 50 yards, not on
some preordained patheticness scale.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.333
Last I checked, pigheadedness
was not the eighth heavenly virtue.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.877
It's only pigheaded if you're wrong.
If you're right,

22:18.004 --> 22:19.713
they call it,
"Sticking to your principles."

22:19.839 --> 22:21.381
Give it up.
You're demeaning yourself.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.133
That's what they told
Rosa Parks.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.885
Don't stand up in there.
I'm watching your feet.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.304
Get out of our home.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.432
This is not a home.
It's certainly not...

22:30.558 --> 22:31.933
It's our home as long as
our son is here.

22:32.059 --> 22:35.270
Mom, Dad, will you please
just calm down.

22:35.396 --> 22:38.565
You're not family.
You have no right to be here.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.067
What are you gonna do? Throw me out?
You can't even touch the gadje.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.236
- I'll touch you.
- What is going on?

22:43.362 --> 22:46.114
I'm the one who brought him here.
I should be able to see how he's doing.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.366
He wouldn't even need to be here
if it weren't for you.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.244
Right. I'm so unclean,
I caused his liver to shut down.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.329
Enough. No one is leaving.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.331
He's our son,
and we want her out of here.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.503
- It hurts.
- It's your stomach again?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.589
- No.
- What?

23:10.890 --> 23:13.349
His liver's
actually improving.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.685
We plug one hole
and end up poking another.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.354
Are we talking about the patient
or how to get a raise from Cuddy?

23:18.481 --> 23:21.232
The Wegener's treatment gave him
a massive hemorrhage in his bladder.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.027
Which means it's Wegener's.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.404
- What did I just say?
- We were treating him for Wegener's

23:26.530 --> 23:28.156
- when everything went wrong.
- Not everything.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.867
Yeah, it was a very
lovely day outside.

23:30.993 --> 23:33.536
On the other hand,
the treatment made him worse.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.747
Treatment made his
bladder worse, not his liver.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.123
Clot in the liver's
breaking up.

23:37.249 --> 23:41.628
And MRI, sputum and ACE
ruled out TB, sarcoidosis and lymphoma,

23:41.754 --> 23:42.962
which leaves us with...

23:43.089 --> 23:44.255
Still could be
a cancer with multiple...

23:44.381 --> 23:47.383
A cancer we can't see
on MRI, CT or blood tests?

23:48.385 --> 23:49.928
It's Wegener's.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.472
It's not the wrong diagnosis.
It's the wrong treatment.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.141
We could increase immunosuppression.
Add methotrexate.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.645
We can't give methotrexate to a kid
who's already had lung problems.

23:58.771 --> 24:02.482
Methotrexate is carpet bombing.
Hits everything.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.526
We need a smart bomb.

24:04.652 --> 24:09.405
We don't suppress the immune system.
We change it.

24:09.824 --> 24:15.620
Immune modulation. FT28. His antibodies
are attacking his blood vessels.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.873
The irritation causes it to bleed
and clot. We change his immune system

24:18.999 --> 24:21.251
so the antibodies don't interact
with his blood vessels

24:21.377 --> 24:22.877
but work fine
everywhere else.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.797
FT28 is still experimental.
It's not FDA approved.

24:25.923 --> 24:28.466
It's worked for Crohn's disease
and rheumatoid arthritis.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.136
He doesn't have Crohn's
or arthritis.

24:31.262 --> 24:35.306
Let's say that he does
and start the treatment.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.481
Absolutely not.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.067
My people have been experimented on
before. Never again.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.695
Mister Lipa,
with all due respect,

24:48.821 --> 24:52.157
comparing this hospital
with Auschwitz, it's ridiculous.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.450
FT28 has been proven
safe in hundreds...

24:54.577 --> 24:56.035
People always say
you can trust them.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.287
Why would they
say anything else?

24:57.413 --> 24:58.872
Why do they think
we would listen?

24:58.998 --> 25:01.207
You think I don't understand
what it's like to come from a people

25:01.333 --> 25:03.501
who've been enslaved,
mistreated and experimented on?

25:03.627 --> 25:06.504
Tuskegee went on for 28 years
after World War II.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.882
And the laws that made it illegal
for the Romany to even set foot

25:09.008 --> 25:13.303
in this state were still on the books
until 1998. It's not ancient history.

25:13.429 --> 25:18.141
Conventional therapy hasn't worked.
Your son may be dying.

25:19.894 --> 25:24.022
He needs a targeted approach,
and you need to trust us.

25:27.818 --> 25:32.280
I'm sorry. A lifetime of experiences
tells me I can't trust you,

25:32.406 --> 25:35.241
and the past three days
have done nothing to change that.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.953
We want our son treated,
not experimented on.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.080
If you don't know how to
do that, then just tell us,

25:41.207 --> 25:43.750
so we can take him
someplace where they do.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.711
They're absolutely right.
Stay away

25:46.837 --> 25:49.756
from that unproven, experimental stuff.
Much better to stick

25:49.882 --> 25:52.091
with the "moving the furniture
until he gets better" approach.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.427
Yes, you're right. We're gonna
have to come up with something else.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.640
Do you mean another last-ditch,
desperation move? You got anything?

25:58.766 --> 26:01.809
Go back and don't take no for an answer.
What kind of salesman are you?

26:01.936 --> 26:03.978
The kind who avoids the house
with the crazy couple

26:04.104 --> 26:05.355
who put tin foil
over their windows.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.481
They got money for tin foil,

26:06.607 --> 26:07.982
they got money for
whatever you're selling.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.859
What's that mean?

26:09.985 --> 26:13.696
It means that if they don't trust you,
you should earn that lack of trust.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.782
What does paying
for tinfoil mean?

26:15.908 --> 26:18.826
Why should I have
to answer all the questions?

26:22.998 --> 26:24.165
Oops.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.834
Sorry. Still getting used to
the power steering.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.128
I assume you've
heard the news?

26:29.255 --> 26:30.255
I'm not worried.

26:30.381 --> 26:33.591
From what I hear, what you lack
in shame, you also lack in willpower.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.719
My will may be weak,
but my backbone is strong

26:36.845 --> 26:39.722
and pain-free
now that I've stopped using the cane.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.975
Of course, it's harder
to look down Cuddy's shirt,

26:42.101 --> 26:45.353
but then the vantage point
on her ass has much improved.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.772
Then that's just me,
always looking on the bright side.

26:47.898 --> 26:50.775
I'm the guy who said
that her C-cups are half full.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.736
They are nice, aren't they?

26:55.531 --> 27:00.493
Oh, no, no, no, you're not
gonna win me over that easily.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.163
You may have a wheel.
It doesn't mean you get the grease.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.082
You gotta squeak.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.265
What's that?

27:22.391 --> 27:23.683
It's cyclophosphamide.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.395
We're continuing
the standard treatment as you requested.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.109
I have to ask everyone
to leave the room for a few minutes

27:33.235 --> 27:35.445
while I apply some bandages.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.447
Why do we have to leave?

27:40.617 --> 27:42.118
They're for his penis.

27:57.051 --> 28:01.512
You lied to them. The bleeding's
stopped. I don't need any bandages.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.640
I need to change
your treatment,

28:04.767 --> 28:06.809
but your parents won't let us.
They've got it in their minds

28:06.935 --> 28:09.854
that we want to try some sort
of inhuman experiment on you.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.689
The treatment's experimental?

28:11.815 --> 28:14.275
FT28 has been through extensive
clinical trials.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.320
It's also been used successfully
for other conditions.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.948
The fact that you're recommending
experimental treatment

28:21.075 --> 28:23.493
means you have
no other options.

28:24.036 --> 28:28.247
Sorry. We stop the pleural effusions,
your liver almost fails.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.333
We save your liver,
the bladder fails.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.584
If we don't get ahead
of the curve on this...

28:31.710 --> 28:32.919
What do you need me to do?

28:36.382 --> 28:39.092
Take the medicine,
but don't tell your parents.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.636
I don't like lying
to my parents.

28:41.762 --> 28:42.887
The rest of the world,
though...

28:43.013 --> 28:44.639
The rest of the world
I can't trust.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.682
You can trust me.

28:46.809 --> 28:47.767
How do I know?

28:49.686 --> 28:53.940
Because if you do this, then tell
your parents, I lose my license.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.913
- God.
- Get in here.

29:16.338 --> 29:19.590
Wow, his spleen
basically exploded, huh?

29:21.552 --> 29:24.178
Got another bleeder.
2-O silk on a stick.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.472
Got it.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.109
I believe you ordered
your meat rare.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.570
Keep him open.
If I confirm Wegener's,

29:40.696 --> 29:43.656
might as well stage the disease
while he's still on the table.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.874
What's taking so long?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.334
External capsule's
ruptured but still intact.

29:55.461 --> 29:59.755
No signs of a clot or a bleed. Normal
follicles, normal lymphoid tissue.

29:59.882 --> 30:03.259
His spleen is ripped to shreds. There's
gotta be granulomas. Keep looking.

30:03.385 --> 30:06.888
Come on, can't leave Humpty Dumpty
like this forever.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.474
I don't see anything
but normal spleen. No granulomas.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.850
Means no Wegener's.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.145
That's all I need to know.
Let's go people.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.563
Run his bowel.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.857
No need. I'm closing.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.244
Suture.

30:51.725 --> 30:52.892
Run his bowel.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.936
Nothing suspicious
in the spleen.

30:55.062 --> 30:56.562
Get him out of here.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.897
You missed it.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.815
He had a granuloma
in his liver.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.026
No, it was just scar tissue.

31:02.152 --> 31:05.404
Looks like a granuloma
on the MRI, but it's not.

31:05.531 --> 31:10.493
I don't know why I'm debating this.
Pass me the Kelly clamp. I'm closing.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.454
Not unless you're gonna sew
my hand into this kid's stomach.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.040
Get out of there.
He's unstable.

31:16.166 --> 31:19.794
He's got Wegener's,
which means he's got granulomas.

31:19.920 --> 31:20.878
I'm calling my lawyer.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.129
It's only 26 feet.

31:22.256 --> 31:24.674
If you were an ostrich,
you'd have a 46-foot wait.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.094
Blood pressure's dropping.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.845
Hang another bag
of Ringer's lactate.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.431
I'm having nothing
to do with this.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.724
Foreman, hang another bag...

31:33.850 --> 31:36.018
Ringer's lactate. Got it.

31:45.487 --> 31:51.200
Come on. Come on. It's gotta be in here.
It's gotta be in here.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.211
It's not.

32:02.713 --> 32:03.921
Mind if we close?

32:10.262 --> 32:15.141
It's a good thing we never sold him
on FT28. His parents were right.

32:25.027 --> 32:27.111
There's no way his parents
are gonna let us near him again.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.614
They won't be able to transfer him
until he's recovered from the surgery.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.907
You can add the surgical team
to the list of people

32:32.034 --> 32:32.992
who won't let us near him.

32:33.118 --> 32:37.622
Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots,
spleen explodes.

32:37.748 --> 32:39.999
We should test for
Von Willebrand's.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.127
Or just play tic-tac-toe.

32:43.253 --> 32:47.548
Okay, X's are bleeds.
O's are clots.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.925
We started in the lungs, right?
What did we do?

32:50.052 --> 32:52.261
CT, sputum, two venograms.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.556
It's one bleed, one clot,
then what?

32:55.682 --> 32:59.101
Liver shut down, MRI, labs,
treated with cyclophosphamide.

32:59.227 --> 33:03.606
Whereupon he peed out three units
of O-negative, another bleed.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.650
- Where is this going?
- I don't know yet.

33:05.776 --> 33:07.193
- What's next?
- Bladder, kidneys.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.029
High-resolution CT scan,
UA and urine sediment.

33:10.155 --> 33:10.988
GI tract?

33:11.114 --> 33:12.740
You ran his small bowel
in the OR.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.742
The large bowel's fixed
to the abdominal wall.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.619
- I didn't run that.
- Because there was no reason to.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.788
He hasn't been having
any symptoms in his bowels.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.206
Do a colonoscopy.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.791
Because he's had no symptoms?

33:21.917 --> 33:24.669
You lose your keys, the first thing
you do is look everywhere

33:24.795 --> 33:26.504
you might logically
have placed them.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.923
When you don't find them,
then you start looking in other places.

33:29.049 --> 33:33.344
The medicine cabinet, freezer, mailbox.
We need to look in this kid's mailbox.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.638
Why don't we x-ray his feet?
They're fine, too.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.932
Because we need to take
the center square to block.

33:38.058 --> 33:41.143
Okay, even if that did make sense,
it's kind of hard to do a colonoscopy

33:41.269 --> 33:43.521
on a kid you can't get near.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.067
He's in the ICU now.

33:48.193 --> 33:51.654
His parent's only have
limited visiting privileges.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.866
I like that kid.
He's got spunk.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.719
Can't talk now. On guard duty.

34:14.845 --> 34:16.095
You're still in that thing?

34:16.221 --> 34:17.388
What thing?

34:18.098 --> 34:20.558
Oh, this?
Forgot it was even there.

34:20.684 --> 34:23.602
You know, even if you manage not to get
struck down by a bolt of lightning,

34:23.729 --> 34:25.646
and make it a week,
Cuddy's not gonna give you the space.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.689
She can't.

34:26.815 --> 34:27.732
A bet's a bet.

34:27.858 --> 34:31.277
Yes, and that rule outranks
the Americans with Disabilities Act.

34:31.403 --> 34:34.697
You think you've got logic on your side,
but Whitner's got the legal system,

34:34.823 --> 34:37.324
and legal beats logic
every time. Just ask OJ.

34:37.451 --> 34:38.868
You're right.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.746
- I am?
- Yeah.

34:41.872 --> 34:43.414
So you're doing this even though

34:43.540 --> 34:45.666
you know you've got no legal leg
to stand on?

34:45.792 --> 34:49.545
Who needs legs when you got wheels?
I'm gonna get that spot.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.132
No way Cuddy is going to gyp me.

34:54.634 --> 34:55.926
What did you say?

34:56.052 --> 34:57.094
I'll see you later.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.806
Gonna have them yelling at me
for the next 20 minutes.

35:01.975 --> 35:06.061
Mucosa looks normal, healthy.
No lonely diverticula.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.606
Blood pressure's dropping.
He's bleeding again.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.940
I'm in his colon.

35:13.195 --> 35:14.862
- Hurry up.
- I am.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.030
There's nothing there.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.865
Wait. Wait. What's that?

35:22.078 --> 35:23.037
A reflection?

35:23.163 --> 35:25.247
No, it's something.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.375
Looks like a...

35:30.337 --> 35:31.462
Toothpick.

35:31.588 --> 35:32.588
Are you sure?

35:32.714 --> 35:34.381
He must have swallowed it accidentally

35:34.508 --> 35:37.176
and just figured
he'd digest it eventually.

35:38.178 --> 35:41.222
When you two were making out in the car,
he must have folded awkwardly,

35:41.348 --> 35:44.266
pushed the toothpick through the wall
of the intestine and into the lung.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.269
Then it moved on to his liver and
made its way to his bladder and spleen.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.979
So that's it?
He's gonna be okay?

35:49.105 --> 35:50.606
Yeah, small holes.

35:50.732 --> 35:53.984
It shouldn't take that long to heal
now that we've got it out.

35:54.110 --> 35:57.571
- See? See what you did?
- Me?

35:57.697 --> 35:58.948
If you hadn't been kissing him...

35:59.074 --> 36:00.616
That's what you heard?

36:00.742 --> 36:03.035
It was the toothpick.
It was that disgusting habit that you...

36:03.161 --> 36:07.039
It would have just passed right through
him if he hadn't been writhing around.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.874
Isn't that right...

36:13.296 --> 36:14.380
That's it?

36:14.506 --> 36:16.465
Yeah, that's it.

36:16.591 --> 36:19.969
Wood absorbs water, becomes the
same density as the tissue around it.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.138
That's why it didn't show up
on the CT or MRI.

36:23.265 --> 36:24.390
That's cool.

36:25.767 --> 36:29.395
I mean, not cool for me,

36:29.521 --> 36:32.773
but a lot of damage
for something so small.

36:33.733 --> 36:38.028
You know, the lab here,
they have a paid intern position.

36:38.154 --> 36:41.490
It's usually given to one of the kids
from the universities,

36:41.616 --> 36:44.785
but if you want,
I could probably get you an interview.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.705
You know, some entry-level
stuff, some gopher work,

36:47.831 --> 36:51.292
but you'd also have access
to a lot of cool things.

36:54.462 --> 36:58.173
Thanks, really, but I can't.

36:58.967 --> 37:02.052
Yes, you can.
Stevie, you're bright.

37:02.762 --> 37:07.308
You have more curiosity
than 90% of the doctors on this staff.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.895
No, it's not that.
It's just...

37:12.731 --> 37:15.816
I go to work every day
with my family, you know?

37:16.568 --> 37:18.944
People I've known
my whole life.

37:19.696 --> 37:20.988
I don't want to lose that.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.740
You can have both.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.119
No, I can't.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.913
Because they don't
want to let you.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.875
They shouldn't be
making you choose.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.419
Maybe not, but they are.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.547
I'm choosing them.

37:41.843 --> 37:45.804
Change is hard.
Trust me, I know.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.642
But it worked out for me.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.894
You're a successful doctor.

37:52.687 --> 37:57.650
Your name is on journal articles.
I would love that.

37:58.777 --> 38:04.490
It's just I see you
with Doctors Chase and Cameron,

38:04.616 --> 38:08.327
and you all got
empty ring fingers.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.375
You're alone.

38:29.891 --> 38:33.018
This is my last day
living a life of leisure.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.980
So are you gonna tell Doctor Whitner
she's out of my space,

38:36.106 --> 38:37.940
- or can I?
- Why would I do that?

38:38.066 --> 38:41.860
Because you said that
you would, and lying is wrong.

38:41.987 --> 38:45.990
I said I would give you the space
if you made it a whole week...

38:46.116 --> 38:47.866
- Which I...
- Didn't.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.121
The bet didn't stipulate that you
had to be in the chair for a week

38:52.247 --> 38:54.832
unless you had to barge
into an operating room

38:54.958 --> 38:56.917
and shove your hands
in a kid's bowels.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.627
You know about that?

38:59.504 --> 39:00.671
You lost.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.715
I saved a life.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.759
Two minutes out of the chair
to save a kid's life.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.011
You lost, House.

39:07.137 --> 39:08.804
I earned that space.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.514
No, you didn't.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.351
I earn that space every day I limp
into that building and do my damn job.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.311
You lost.

39:17.564 --> 39:18.564
Hey!

39:25.655 --> 39:30.409
You were never gonna give me that space,
were you? I saw Whitner the other day.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.911
She knew about the bet,
didn't seem that worried.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.246
She knew I'd win.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.331
She doesn't know me.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.167
In fact, she doesn't know anything,
except what you tell her.

39:38.293 --> 39:42.838
You told her that you were never gonna
give me that space, didn't you?

39:45.467 --> 39:49.261
Just tell me,
do you at least feel a little guilty?

39:51.556 --> 39:56.101
You wanna teach me lessons,
don't make commitments you can't keep.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.485
How's it going?

40:04.611 --> 40:05.861
How guilty does she look?

40:09.616 --> 40:11.784
About an eight.

40:12.202 --> 40:16.622
That space is mine.
Veni, vidi, vici.
