CHRIS ROCK:
At the end of the school year,
I was going to graduate

00:03.804 --> 00:05.639
from Corleone Junior High.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.475
My eighth grade picture
had a list

00:07.508 --> 00:10.344
of everything I'd accomplished,
which so far, was nothing.

00:10.378 --> 00:13.314
This was my last chance to make
sure that didn't happen again.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.383
Why aren't you filling out
your yearbook activities form?

00:15.416 --> 00:17.185
Because right now,
the only thing I have

00:17.218 --> 00:19.287
to put under my picture is
"human punching bag."

00:19.320 --> 00:21.322
How about "First Black
kid at Corleone"?

00:21.355 --> 00:24.225
Actually, I wasn't the first
Black kid at Corleone...

00:26.194 --> 00:29.330
I was just the first one
that made it into the building.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.465
Okay, so I might be the first.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.334
But until now,
that hasn't meant a whole lot.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.336
But you tried out for
the basketball team.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.637
And ran for class president.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.206
Yeah, but I failed.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.373
Nobody remembers failure.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.608
I thought about
other Black people

00:40.641 --> 00:42.176
who were first at something,

00:42.210 --> 00:44.278
and what it would be like
if they had failed.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.213
Thanks for showing up.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.515
This Black guy was
in here, uh, Robinson.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.218
You know I was going to break
the color line for him.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.685
He showed up 20 minutes late.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.687
Claimed he couldn't
get a seat on the bus.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.523
Now you, kid,
you can't hit.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.690
You can't run.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.126
You can't throw.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.593
But you show up on time.

00:59.627 --> 01:00.861
It's not too late.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.098
You can still get
involved in an activity.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.333
Like what?

01:05.366 --> 01:06.300
I don't know.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.268
Something that plays
into your strong suits.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.538
Problem was,
all I had were weak suits.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.605
Choir.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.374
I can't sing.
Glee Club.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.408
I can't sing.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.476
The debate team.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.644
You can talk, can't you?

01:16.677 --> 01:17.478
Yeah, but that's full.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.748
Well, it looks like
the only thing left

01:20.781 --> 01:22.550
is the Chess Club
and Journalism staff.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.652
I thought about joining
the Chess Club.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.853
Go!

01:31.292 --> 01:33.827
Extra, extra!
Dummy joins newspaper.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.396
School newspaper, here I come.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.398
Because failure
is not an option.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.767
School newspapers are different
in white neighborhoods.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.936
For one thing,
there's no obituary column.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.938
So, what do you
want to write about?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.474
Politics.
No.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.675
I write about politics.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.344
Okay, then sports.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.213
No, Ping does
the sports column.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.947
Mostly covers Ping-Pong.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.616
Okay, then entertainment.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.618
Like, movie reviews
and stuff like that.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.554
This isn't Jet magazine,
this is a newspaper.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.223
I like Jet.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.291
Okay, then what do you
want me to write about?

02:37.325 --> 02:38.859
I don't know, something
that you know about.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.562
She doesn't have the guts to
suggest a fried chicken column.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.564
Like what?
I don't know.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.766
Something that's
unique to you.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.469
You know, something that's
unique to you, Blackety.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.638
While I thought
about what to write,

02:50.671 --> 02:52.640
my father thought
something was wrong.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.408
Re!

02:54.442 --> 02:56.510
Why're you campaigning
for this guy?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.412
Because my daddy
supported his daddy

02:58.446 --> 02:59.813
when he was
city councilman,

02:59.847 --> 03:02.516
and now I am just carrying
on the tradition.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.751
But you're hardly home as it is.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.853
Who gonna take
care of the house?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.588
That look means,
"Ain't you got two hands?"

03:07.621 --> 03:08.889
Baby, don't worry.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.558
The campaign will be over soon

03:10.591 --> 03:12.393
then everything will be
back to normal.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.662
I don't know why you want
to be involved with this guy.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.564
He's nothing but a
crook and a womanizer.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.499
Julius, would you
quit being jealous.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.667
He is not a crook.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.802
I've know him
since I was a teenager.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.672
So, even Saddam Hussein
had friends.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.908
Could you get that?

03:29.577 --> 03:30.878
Thank you, baby.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.515
Julius, ha-ha!

03:34.548 --> 03:36.550
Good to see you,
my brother.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.519
Hope you plan to
vote next week.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.687
Yeah, I-I do.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.854
Hope you plan to lose.

03:40.888 --> 03:41.955
Hi, Lamar!

03:41.989 --> 03:43.391
Rochelle, how're you doing?

03:43.424 --> 03:45.293
Good to see you.
Look at you.
Oh, good.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.660
Rochelle,
I want to thank you

03:46.694 --> 03:48.562
for volunteering
to help our campaign.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.997
Oh, not a problem, Lamar.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.865
You know you are
like family to me.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.967
Like play cousins.

03:54.001 --> 03:57.671
My mother saw a councilman,
but my father saw this:

04:00.073 --> 04:01.675
Rochelle, baby,

04:01.709 --> 04:03.944
Daddy needs you to get on out
there with your fine self

04:03.977 --> 04:05.579
and get Daddy them votes.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.416
Aw! But Daddy, it's raining
cats and dogs out there.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.550
Cats...

04:09.583 --> 04:11.552
Girl, you better
get on out there

04:11.585 --> 04:12.653
and go on
that campaigning.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.387
Get on out there.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.756
Vote for Daddy.
Vote for Daddy.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.025
Uh, so can I pick
these up later?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.361
Oh, yeah, you know what,
I'll get started on them now.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.429
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.563
What about dinner?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.398
Oh, baby, can't we order
Chinese food?

04:24.432 --> 04:25.833
Well, who gonna pay
for this Chinese food?

04:25.866 --> 04:28.702
Uh, I can pay you
with my undying gratitude.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.505
Well, can you
pay me back with $13.43?

04:31.539 --> 04:32.940
:
Julius...

04:34.975 --> 04:36.810
Julius, you funny, man.
Yeah.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.045
No, you funnier.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.747
No, you funny.
No, you really funny.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.981
And you lucky.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.084
I mean, you got yourself
a fine woman right here.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.086
Yes, yes.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.655
Don't worry, baby, I'll cook.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.693
Uh, I was going anyway.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.628
Bye.
Listen,
don't forget to vote.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.596
Oh, I won't.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.332
Oh, he won't, but not for you.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.669
Oh, Julius.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.108
Yuck!
What's the matter?

05:08.141 --> 05:11.011
My peas are touching
my mashed potatoes.
So what?

05:11.044 --> 05:13.581
I just hate when one food
touches another.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.417
Baby, that's what mashed
potatoes are for.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.851
They're like little
clumps of glue

05:17.885 --> 05:19.620
that you use to
pick up your peas.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.855
That's disgusting.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.357
I could only imagine
what would've happened

05:23.391 --> 05:24.692
if I'd tried that.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.959
I can't eat this.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.695
My peas are touching
my mashed potatoes.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.998
Are they separated now?

05:31.031 --> 05:32.700
Mm-hmm.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.636
Chris, put that paper away.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.605
You're just
like your daddy.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.473
You know better
than to read at the table.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.742
Sorry, ma-- it's just that
I'm writing an article

05:41.775 --> 05:43.644
in the school paper
and I'm looking for ideas.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.513
Oh, well...

05:45.546 --> 05:47.715
why don't you write
about Councilman Johnson,

05:47.748 --> 05:48.982
and all the wonderful things

05:49.016 --> 05:50.784
that are happening
in the neighborhood?

05:50.818 --> 05:51.585
Like crack?

05:51.619 --> 05:53.821
You know what,
as a matter of fact,

05:53.854 --> 05:55.789
I think we all should help.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.491
Drew, you can
help me put up posters.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.159
And Tonya,
you can hand out buttons.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.728
I've got homework.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.564
Yeah, and I got to read
an autobiography on Billy Ocean.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.766
Don't even look at me.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.536
You know, that's a shame.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.839
People marched and had dogs
and hoses turned on them

06:11.872 --> 06:14.408
for the right to vote, and
you guys can't even help.

06:14.442 --> 06:17.778
Maybe you should turn
dogs and hoses on them.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.548
Okay, fine.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.583
I'll do it by myself.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.187
My mother had to do it on her
own, and so did I.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.022
How's school?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.959
Tough, I've got to write
an article for the school paper.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.194
Oh, you're a writer now, huh?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.796
Well, it's just that this
is my last year

06:35.829 --> 06:37.164
at Corleone and I think people

06:37.197 --> 06:38.799
won't remember me
unless I do something.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.568
Good for you.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.803
It's great to
be a writer.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.805
You can get your legacy started.

06:44.838 --> 06:45.939
Legacy?

06:45.973 --> 06:47.007
Your legacy.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.876
Like, what people remember
you for.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.110
Somebody should tell
Bobby Brown

06:50.143 --> 06:51.812
about this whole
"legacy" thing.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.714
Only problem is, I don't
know what to write about.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.048
Well, you happen to be in luck.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.817
I got a lot you can write about.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.652
But you're gonna have to
tone it down a little bit,

06:58.686 --> 06:59.787
because it's juicy.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.589
Really?
Yeah.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.724
You know, when I was young,

07:03.757 --> 07:06.059
I was arealplayer.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.728
I dated women

07:07.761 --> 07:09.997
wherever I could find them.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.734
Oh, yeah, I was what you'd
call a serial dater.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.869
I went out with
thousands of women.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.738
They all cried when I left.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.007
But they'd all take me
back in a second.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.975
No, I didn't know that.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.945
I dated all the pretty
women in Syracuse.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.213
Both of them.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.750
Then I dated all the
pretty women in Albany.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.818
Now we're up to three.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.522
Then, I dated all the pretty
women in Pittsburgh.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.823
Okay, we're back at two.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.891
But I know it's hard
to look at old Doc

07:37.925 --> 07:39.693
and think of me in that way,

07:39.727 --> 07:41.695
but I'm a real lady killer.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.130
I knew one thing for sure:

07:43.163 --> 07:45.866
nobody at school
was writing about this.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.201
While I was getting my story
down,
Johnson!

07:48.235 --> 07:50.270
my mother was
getting the vote out.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.973
Vote Johnson! Johnson!
You got it, you got it.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.678
Johnson!

08:01.048 --> 08:03.884
Vote for Johnson!
Vote for Johnson!

08:03.917 --> 08:05.853
Here, vote for Johnson,
he's a great guy.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.655
Vote for John... hey!

08:07.688 --> 08:09.957
Wait! Wait! Wait!

08:09.990 --> 08:10.924
Wait, wait a minute!

08:10.958 --> 08:12.826
Wait a minute, what the
hell are you doing?!

08:12.860 --> 08:14.562
I'm trying to prevent
the election

08:14.595 --> 08:16.296
of this evil individual.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.231
Lamar Johnson is not evil.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.668
You know that since
this man has come into office,

08:20.701 --> 08:23.070
my business has dropped 35%?

08:23.103 --> 08:26.874
That's because the murder
rate has dropped 35%.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.909
The whole reason
I moved to Bed-Stuy

08:28.942 --> 08:30.578
was because
business was booming.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.780
I couldn't keep
a casket in stock.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.015
They were literally
flying into the ground.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.684
You are sick.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.818
That's why I'm going
to do everything

08:37.851 --> 08:38.986
in my power to get
him re-elected.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.988
I'm going to do everything
in my power to get him defeated.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.956
What?! Wait a minute now.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.224
If you're not voting

08:44.257 --> 08:45.826
for Johnson,
who are you voting for?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.130
Himelfarb?

08:50.163 --> 08:53.166
Abe Himelfarb,
who owns the pawn shop?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.935
With Himelfarb in office,

08:54.968 --> 08:57.037
everything will fall
naturally into place.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.076
Over my dead body!

09:04.211 --> 09:06.013
That would be tragic,

09:06.046 --> 09:08.115
but if it were to happen,
you can rest assured

09:08.148 --> 09:10.884
I'll give Mr. Julius
a nice discount.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.921
You... you just stay away
from my posters.

09:15.756 --> 09:19.059
Vote for Johnson!
Vote for John...

09:19.092 --> 09:20.628
Hey! Hey!

09:20.661 --> 09:22.663
Wait! Stop that man!

09:22.696 --> 09:24.164
Stop him!

09:24.197 --> 09:26.867
Wait! Wait!

09:26.900 --> 09:29.870
When I turned in my story,
Lisa read me the riot act.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.171
You call yourself a writer?

09:31.204 --> 09:33.206
This is the worst
story I've ever read.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.743
I just wasted
20 minutes of my life.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.378
Do you know how many trees
died for you to write this?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.681
You're destroying
the ozone layer.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.882
People are gonna get cancer.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.316
Okay, okay, I get it.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.685
So what's wrong with it?

09:44.718 --> 09:46.153
Everything--
who wants to read

09:46.186 --> 09:48.021
about some crusty
old ghetto Romeo?

09:48.055 --> 09:50.023
Well, you told me write
about something I know,
and I know this guy.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.391
Well, if this
is the best you can do,

09:51.424 --> 09:53.627
maybe you should think
about doing something else.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.196
Like the Chess Club?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.932
Go!

10:04.805 --> 10:06.940
I wonder if there's
a Checkers Club.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.815
Lisa hated my story,
so I showed it to Ms. Morello,

10:14.848 --> 10:16.784
who loved anything black.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.886
Lisa's right, this isn't good.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.821
What's wrong with it?

10:20.854 --> 10:25.125
Chris, there's nothing worse
than racial stereotypes.

10:25.158 --> 10:28.161
We've seen this
a thousand times.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.031
The tall, shirtless Black man,

10:31.064 --> 10:33.967
his ebony pecs
glistening with sweat

10:34.001 --> 10:35.168
from working in the fields.

10:35.202 --> 10:40.974
His furrowed brow
filled with savage lust.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.177
Where was I?

10:44.211 --> 10:47.414
I think you were talking
about racial stereotypes.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.817
Oh, right.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.285
I want to read
about the real Black men

10:52.319 --> 10:54.988
who walk the gritty streets
of the hood.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.791
People like Super Fly,

10:57.825 --> 11:01.294
the Mack, Black Belt Jones,

11:01.328 --> 11:04.031
Truck Turner and Blacula.

11:04.064 --> 11:08.001
Tell me the truth
about the pimps

11:08.035 --> 11:10.470
and the hustlers,
the violence...

11:10.503 --> 11:12.940
all set to a jazzy beat!

11:12.973 --> 11:15.809
Oh, there's a jazzy beat
I want to give her,

11:15.843 --> 11:17.310
right upside the head.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.879
Everyone else hated my article,

11:18.912 --> 11:21.148
but I knew I could count
on Greg for support.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.716
It's horrible, dude.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.885
I've only been to your
neighborhood twice,

11:24.918 --> 11:26.253
and even I have more
exciting stories.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.221
Well, I don't know
what to write about,

11:28.255 --> 11:30.023
'cause everything they're
asking for doesn't exist.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.160
That's the wrong
attitude.
What do you mean?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.795
Do you want to be remembered

11:34.828 --> 11:36.897
for being something more
than just a human pinata?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.298
Yeah.
Do you want to
have something

11:38.331 --> 11:39.967
under your picture
in the yearbook?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.302
Yeah.
Then give the
people what they want.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.041
I thought journalism
was supposed

11:48.075 --> 11:49.409
to be about
reporting the facts,

11:49.442 --> 11:51.244
but what I found out is that

11:51.278 --> 11:53.013
people don't always
want the facts.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.282
So I decided to givethe people
what they want.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.851
I took Doc's story
about being a lady killer,

11:57.885 --> 11:59.753
and dropped the word "lady."

11:59.787 --> 12:01.188
OMAR:
Who do you want to beat?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.089
CROWD:
Johnson!

12:02.122 --> 12:04.124
OMAR:
When do you want to beat him?
Now!

12:04.157 --> 12:05.993
When I say, "Johnson,"
you say, "Fool." Johnson!

12:06.026 --> 12:07.160
CROWD:
Fool!
Johnson!

12:07.194 --> 12:08.128
What is that noise?

12:08.161 --> 12:09.296
That's Mr. Omar.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.831
He's having
an anti-Johnson rally.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.066
When do you want
to beat him?
What?!

12:13.100 --> 12:15.168
When I say, "Johnson," you
say, "Fool"-- Johnson!
Fool!

12:15.202 --> 12:16.937
Johnson!
Oh! J...

12:16.970 --> 12:18.238
Who do you
want to beat?
Johnson!

12:18.271 --> 12:20.440
ROCHELLE:
Tonya, tap your butt on
downstairs and lock the door.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.809
Go on, now!

12:21.842 --> 12:22.976
...you say,
"Fool." Johnson!

12:23.010 --> 12:24.111
CROWD:
Fool!

12:24.144 --> 12:25.312
Johnson!
Fool!

12:25.345 --> 12:27.881
Hey, hey, don't
listen to that fool.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.049
Johnson is a good man.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.951
He's cleaning up our streets!

12:30.984 --> 12:32.185
Vote Johnson!

12:32.219 --> 12:33.854
What kind of councilman got

12:33.887 --> 12:36.890
people campaigning for him
hollering out of windows?!

12:36.924 --> 12:38.125
Vote for Himelfarb!

12:38.158 --> 12:39.259
How you gonna

12:39.292 --> 12:41.929
vote for somebody, and you can't
even spell their name?!

12:41.962 --> 12:43.163
Vote Johnson!

12:43.196 --> 12:47.000
We can't spell his name, 'cause
Johnson ruined the schools.

12:47.034 --> 12:47.968
Vote for Himelfarb!

12:48.001 --> 12:50.971
When I say, "Himel,"
you say "Farb"-- Himel!

12:51.004 --> 12:51.905
Farb!
Himel!

12:51.939 --> 12:54.374
Farb!
Well, at least
Johnson ain't locked

12:54.407 --> 12:56.409
out of his own
damn house!

12:56.443 --> 12:58.946
When I say, "Locked,"
you say, "Out"-- Locked!

12:58.979 --> 13:00.180
CROWD:
Out!

13:00.213 --> 13:01.381
Locked!
Out!

13:01.414 --> 13:02.549
That's what he is.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.417
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!

13:04.451 --> 13:06.854
Where you going?
Where you going? Come on!

13:06.887 --> 13:10.157
Himelfarb will open doors
that's been shut.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.893
He will put a chicken
in every pot.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.562
After I changed my story,
everyone else changed theirs.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.165
Oh, Chris!

13:18.198 --> 13:19.399
Oh!

13:19.432 --> 13:20.400
My brilliant

13:20.433 --> 13:22.535
little Alex Haley.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.171
So, did you like the story?

13:24.204 --> 13:25.338
Like it? I love it!

13:25.372 --> 13:27.107
The Scissor Killer?!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.608
I wouldn't step
foot in Bed-Stuy

13:28.641 --> 13:30.310
for all the money
in the world.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.345
That's how most people feel.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.480
It was so
frightening!

13:33.513 --> 13:36.149
So real!
The truth leapt off the page.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.584
The truth jumped off a cliff.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.186
So, are you going to publish it?

13:39.219 --> 13:40.287
Are you kidding?
After this story,

13:40.320 --> 13:43.056
no one at this school
will ever forget you, Chris.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.024
But that's just
the beginning.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.459
This Scissor Killer has got
to be stopped,

13:49.229 --> 13:50.463
atthe Brooklyn Crier, and
they published it, too! Look!

13:54.467 --> 13:56.203
Because of you,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.972
they're going to bring
this man to justice.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.341
Because of me,
they're gonna waste their time.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.614
CHRIS ROCK:
I wanted to be remembered,
and this was something

14:07.647 --> 14:09.316
people were never going
to forget.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.218
Brooklyn was paralyzed
with fear.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.953
There was fear
in the beauty shop.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.154
"Put the knife to her and..."

14:15.588 --> 14:18.225
There was fear
in the barbershop.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.093
There was even fear
in the gutter.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.395
* All our times have come

14:22.429 --> 14:24.297
There was only one man
who was happy.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.233
* Here but now they're gone...

14:26.266 --> 14:28.235
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.974
The Brooklyn Crier is working
in conjunction

14:34.007 --> 14:36.309
with local authorities
to determine the whereabouts

14:36.343 --> 14:39.279
of a man known only
as The Scissor Killer.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.149
The Scissor Killer was brought
to the attention of the Crier

14:42.182 --> 14:44.684
by this Corleone Junior
High School student after...

14:44.717 --> 14:48.321
Rochelle, good God,
have you seen the stories?

14:48.355 --> 14:50.357
I just saw it on TV.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.259
:
This is a... a...

14:53.560 --> 14:56.029
Oh, this is a disaster!

14:56.063 --> 14:58.398
Can you believe what this is
going to do to the community?

14:58.431 --> 15:01.368
I mean, why would you let
your son Chris write a story

15:01.401 --> 15:04.037
like this when I'm trying
to get reelected?

15:04.071 --> 15:06.306
What? You're worried about
being reelected when my son

15:06.339 --> 15:07.674
is out there
about to be

15:07.707 --> 15:09.676
snipped to death by
a scissor killer?!

15:09.709 --> 15:11.979
Is that what you
saying to me?!

15:12.012 --> 15:14.281
Uh, n-no, no.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.248
Yes!

15:15.282 --> 15:16.216
I'm saying

15:16.249 --> 15:18.051
what would people think

15:18.085 --> 15:20.587
if I'm allowing a
serial killer to roam
the neighborhood?!

15:20.620 --> 15:23.690
I hadn't seen spin like that
since Usher battled Omarion.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.993
I don't know
if you noticed or not,

15:26.026 --> 15:27.627
but ain't nobody
in the neighborhood

15:27.660 --> 15:29.629
except that killer
and my baby!

15:29.662 --> 15:33.366
My story had pulled the wool
over the community's eyes,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.235
but Doc's eyes
weren't woolly at all.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.270
Who keeps taking
these posters down?

15:39.206 --> 15:43.010
Now, Chris, let me see
if I understand this correctly.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.113
The killer
came over here

15:46.146 --> 15:48.248
and spontaneously
confessed to you

15:48.281 --> 15:51.051
about his murderous
past in Syracuse,

15:51.084 --> 15:52.452
Albany and Pittsburgh.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.521
Is that about right?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.389
Yeah, if by right,
you mean wrong.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.557
Yeah, kind of.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.527
Oh, what part of
that did I get wrong?

16:00.560 --> 16:03.263
The part about the killer
coming out here.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.599
Chris, you've got this
whole neighborhood terrified.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.701
Ain't nobody
on the streets.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.171
Ain't nobody out here, ain't
nobody coming in the store.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.473
I'm sorry; it's just that
I want to be remembered.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.276
Chris, you can't base
your legacy on lies.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.746
Now, you got to go and
tell somebody what you did.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.218
Walking home,
I couldn't help thinking

16:25.252 --> 16:28.221
that my street was usually
filled with life,

16:28.255 --> 16:31.158
and now it was an empty
wasteland, all because of me.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.160
I felt worse
than food poisoning.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.629
Little dude from across
the street... come here, man.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.399
Man, what you
doing out there?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.034
Don't you know there's
a killer on the streets?

16:41.068 --> 16:43.270
Nah, I'll be all right.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.537
Let me hold a dollar.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.740
* The people getting angry...

16:47.774 --> 16:50.377
Be safe out here.

16:50.410 --> 16:54.714
Did I just get mugged
from a window?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.818
Not only was Brooklyn filled
with fear,

16:58.851 --> 17:01.088
it was filled with reporters.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.556
WOMAN:
Today, the streets of
Bedford Stuyvesant are deserted.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.093
All of the murderers,
rapists and Black people

17:06.126 --> 17:07.327
who normally populate
these streets

17:07.360 --> 17:08.728
are behind
closed doors.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.530
And yet, it
is no safer,

17:10.563 --> 17:12.332
because of one man--
the Scissor Killer.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.501
There's the young man
that-that broke the story.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.570
Let's see if we can get a word.
Young man... what we... how...

17:17.604 --> 17:19.772
Can you tell us any
more about the killer?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.341
What kind of sweat
socks did he use?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.443
How did you get away?
How did you get him...?

17:23.476 --> 17:25.145
The thing I was most afraid of

17:25.178 --> 17:27.080
was telling my parents
I'd made up the story.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.781
I couldn't think
of anything worse.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.584
Hello, worse.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.820
Oh, my God, Chris,
where have you been?!

17:33.853 --> 17:36.389
I was so worried
about you!

17:36.423 --> 17:38.158
Your daddy is
on his way home.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.792
This detective wants
to talk to you.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.294
If you're Black,

17:41.328 --> 17:43.330
that's a sentence
you never want to hear.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.266
Listen, Chris, we need a
description of the killer.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.235
Give me a second
to make one up.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.702
Well, he's Black,

17:49.736 --> 17:53.440
um, five-two,
light skin, uh, afro?

17:53.473 --> 17:55.175
He stopped listening
after Black.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.843
What's going on?
There he is!

17:56.876 --> 17:58.678
On the floor, now!
ROCHELLE:
No! No! No, no, no, no, no!

17:58.711 --> 18:00.413
Hey! Oh, oh, oh!
You're going
to fry for this one!

18:00.447 --> 18:01.781
Hey! Chris!
ROCHELLE:
You got the wrong person!

18:01.814 --> 18:03.750
No, no, no! That's my father.
He's not a killer!

18:03.783 --> 18:05.452
How do you know?

18:05.485 --> 18:06.819
If I didn't tell the truth,

18:06.853 --> 18:08.655
there was going
to be an obituary.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.157
'Cause there is
no killer.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.358
What?!

18:11.391 --> 18:12.825
You better explain
yourself, Chris.

18:12.859 --> 18:13.860
I made it up.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.429
When I handed in my story
to the school newspaper,

18:16.463 --> 18:19.499
they said it was so dull that
they wouldn't even print it,

18:19.532 --> 18:22.435
so I made the story a little bit
more interesting to read.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.803
I'm sorry.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.439
There's a gun pointing at
your daddy's head right now,

18:26.473 --> 18:27.774
and you're sorry?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.177
Lamar Johnson's
campaign

18:30.210 --> 18:31.744
is falling apart,
and you're sorry.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.680
People are running
around this neighborhood

18:33.713 --> 18:37.217
just scared to death,
and you're sorry.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.186
Boy, you don't know
what sorry is.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.388
I'm going to ask you
one more time, ma'am:

18:41.421 --> 18:42.589
Do you know this man?

18:42.622 --> 18:44.191
Yes! That's my husband,

18:44.224 --> 18:45.592
for God sakes!

18:45.625 --> 18:46.826
Son,

18:46.859 --> 18:48.928
you've got a knack
for inventing evidence.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.631
You might want to consider
a career in law enforcement.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.701
In a moment,
I might need a cop myself.

18:56.936 --> 19:00.507
All I did was stretch the truth.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.741
Oh, that's a
coincidence,

19:01.774 --> 19:03.643
'cause I'm about to
stretch your behind.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.312
Get upstairs!

19:05.345 --> 19:07.247
After my mother
set me straight,

19:07.280 --> 19:08.848
I had to set
the story straight.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.483
You made it up?
Well, I'm sorry.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.452
I was just giving the people
what they want.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.553
Oh, this is
just great.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.822
All the real killers
running around Bed-Stuy, and you

19:15.855 --> 19:17.324
had to make one up.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.526
That's just lazy.
What else did you make up?

19:19.559 --> 19:20.693
Is your real
name Chris?

19:20.727 --> 19:22.229
Are you
even Black?

19:22.262 --> 19:23.530
Who knows?

19:23.563 --> 19:26.499
This is so disappointing.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.236
You're the first
Black writer in the
school's history.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.870
I was the first Black
everything

19:30.903 --> 19:32.038
in the school's history.

19:32.071 --> 19:36.476
You reach reporter status,
and you make up your story?

19:36.509 --> 19:39.479
What will your
people think of you?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.687
You just had to lie,
didn't you, Aesop?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.722
Hey, dude.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.594
So, I gave the people what
they want, and now look at me.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.963
Sometimes people don't
like what they want
after they get it.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.398
I wonder if he'll want my foot

19:58.431 --> 19:59.632
in his behind
after he gets that.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.933
I got the yearbook.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.237
I learned a couple of important
things from this whole fiasco.

20:04.271 --> 20:07.006
Number one,
I learned the word legacy.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.375
Number two, people are suckers

20:08.408 --> 20:09.942
for a serial
Scissor Killer story.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.645
And C-- hey, I could write.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.581
But best of all,

20:14.614 --> 20:16.583
I finally did get
something written

20:16.616 --> 20:18.718
under my school
yearbook picture.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.588
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:21.621 --> 20:25.358
