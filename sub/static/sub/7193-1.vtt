00:45.295 --> 00:48.088
Who wanted cheese? Joe. Rem Dogg.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.798
- No Nutella?
- No Nutella.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.717
Right, bacon?

00:52.093 --> 00:55.304
I'm gonna cry.
Justin Bieber signed the visitors' book.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.518
Class K, if you don't shut up, you can
wave goodbye to the Heineken factory.

01:01.686 --> 01:05.647
- Was she like Bridget Jones?
- No, she was persecuted by the Nazis.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.775
Here you go, Downton Abbey.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.946
Cleo, check it out. I just put some
magic mushrooms in Mr Wickers' crepe.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.114
Move, man.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.575
- FML, this line is not cute.
- Queue jump?

01:17.285 --> 01:19.745
Rem Dogg, we're not using your wheelchair

01:19.913 --> 01:23.624
to queue barge Hasidic Jews
into an Anne Frank exhibition.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.713
Sorry.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.049
Look more ill.

01:36.054 --> 01:41.433
Now, guys, before we go in, please for
once can you just be respectful.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.819
Jing...
I've found Anne.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.829
That's a waxwork model.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.502
Sir?

02:11.506 --> 02:13.090
Sir?

02:14.592 --> 02:16.218
Are you okay?

02:18.304 --> 02:22.349
Hush, Po, Anne's trying to speak.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.319
She wants to go home.

02:43.621 --> 02:46.248
Call the Police!
Stop!

04:21.219 --> 04:25.180
We're gonna make it.

04:59.048 --> 05:03.051
Susan, I think I discussed this
in the last meeting.

05:03.219 --> 05:06.972
We are all a little uncomfortable
being called to order by a rape alarm.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.143
Our children are not going
on another school trip with that clown.

05:11.311 --> 05:16.023
Mr Wickers assures me that this field trip
is of great academic value.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.066
They're going to Las Vegas!

05:20.403 --> 05:22.487
- Great for their maths.
- And French.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.991
- They're seeing Celine Dion.
- We are all sick of that buffoon

05:26.159 --> 05:27.743
being protected by his father...

05:28.369 --> 05:29.703
Or so his mother assured me.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.289
- ...his sexual playmate...
- Odd choice of words.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.250
- ...and the headmaster.
- His wingman. Home slice.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.253
- Brother from another mother.
- A joke!

05:38.421 --> 05:40.464
Look, he isn't perfect, but...

05:40.840 --> 05:45.218
...Alfie Wickers is a
truly wonderful teacher.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.638
Class K forever, yeah?

05:49.057 --> 05:50.098
It's so cute.

05:50.266 --> 05:54.519
If you do a cock and balls,
I'll never buy you cigarettes ever again.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.064
Have you got any idea
how much this is gonna hurt?

05:57.857 --> 06:02.819
Pain is temporary, Joe. Being an
absolute badass lasts forever. Ink me.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.086
- Are you sure you're good to carry on?
- Yeah.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.007
I've got it.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.010
Why don't we give Alfie the chance
to defend himself?

06:27.178 --> 06:29.388
We could pay him
a visit right now.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.475
What a terrific idea.

06:33.851 --> 06:37.312
So, we were looking at the First War
of Scottish Independence.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.856
And you know what that means.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.234
It's Class Wars!

06:48.157 --> 06:51.201
So, it is the siege of Stirling Castle!

06:51.369 --> 06:54.037
- 20th of July, 1304.
- Nice, mate.

06:54.205 --> 06:57.082
And what tactic did the English use
to defeat the Scots?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.292
Military blockade.
They cut off their enemy's supply lines.

06:59.460 --> 07:04.172
Correct. So, during break,
I went through your bags blockading you.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.217
- I cut off your water, your food...
- My Pepperami!

07:07.385 --> 07:09.845
- And your communication.
- Sneaky bitch!

07:10.012 --> 07:14.057
Giving you no option but to lay down
your weapons and surrender.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.652
Where's Gagarin?

07:26.446 --> 07:29.239
Freedom!

07:38.624 --> 07:40.167
Mum!

07:41.127 --> 07:43.420
This is a place of learning, Mr Wickers.

07:43.588 --> 07:47.257
- Not Takeshi's Castle.
- Oh, great reference.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.719
- But, Mum, we are learning.
- Joseph, stop defending him.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.888
He's the biggest child in the school.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.184
Oh, for God's sake,
how do you switch this thing off?

07:57.643 --> 08:00.770
- Um, Susan...
- Don't 'Susan' me! Thank you.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.857
There's got to be a switch somewhere.
Ah, here we are.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.639
Just like that hamster,
you're up to your neck in it.

08:35.806 --> 08:39.851
So, I'm sorry, Alfredo, the parents just
won't pay for the Vegas trip.

08:40.019 --> 08:43.605
We'll do a fundraiser. Or wait,
doesn't the school have a travel bursary?

08:43.773 --> 08:46.358
Had a travel bursary.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.153
A few years back, I invested
that particular nest egg in art.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.531
Well, great.
Art famously goes up in value.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.416
- They're literally worthless.
- Fine. Then I'll pay.

09:03.834 --> 09:07.462
Seriously, take it out of my salary.
My kids deserve that trip.

09:07.630 --> 09:11.341
You're gonna pay for your class to fly an
11,000 mile roundtrip

09:11.509 --> 09:14.386
to spend a week in Las Vegas?

09:17.431 --> 09:18.974
Who wants to go to Cornwall?

09:20.309 --> 09:22.727
- What the hell is Cornwall?
- It's a county, Chantelle.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.272
- But it's abroad, right?
- No. A county in England.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.774
Rolling hills, smugglers' coves...

09:27.942 --> 09:33.321
I ain't travelling 6 hours to stand
in a field watching some bait farmer

09:33.489 --> 09:35.198
wank off sheeps into a bucket.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.450
An agricultural practice I'm unaware of.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.662
We have to go on a post-exam trip.
It's a rite of passage.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.206
Did you go on one, sir, after your GCSEs?

09:43.374 --> 09:45.125
Yeah. Shagaluf with the lads.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.503
I'm sworn to secrecy but I'm sure
you can guess what we got up to.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.831
You sat in a villa with the Bullingdon
Club lugeing port off each other's dicks.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.386
Cornwall is gonna be insane.
And get this...

09:56.554 --> 10:00.390
my best friend from school, Atticus Hoye,
is throwing a house party down there.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.977
I'm talking pop up tiki bar,
fairground rides...

10:04.145 --> 10:05.895
...a frickin' Nando's van.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.063
Yes!

10:07.148 --> 10:09.441
Atticus? Man, you're posh.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.527
How is that posh?
He's just my old fencing buddy.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.988
- Did you cross swords with him, sir?
- Hell, yeah.

10:15.323 --> 10:19.075
I buried my tip into him more times
than I... I see what you've done there.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.914
I hope you all have a great time.
Wish I could come.

10:25.750 --> 10:29.085
Don't be silly, you are coming.
It's not Class K without the big man.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.880
Mum will never let me go to Cornwall,
or on a house party.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.049
She's not gonna know, thanks to this.

10:34.216 --> 10:38.178
A fake itinerary I have devised full of
lame school trippy shit.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.853
The Eden Project, some castles,
a nunnery.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.521
It's gonna be fine.

10:48.689 --> 10:52.901
Well, I've printed out parent contact
details, a list of local hospitals...

10:53.069 --> 10:56.571
...and some articles on the complex
political developments in the region.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.239
It's Cornwall, not Syria.

10:58.407 --> 11:02.285
And if you're worried about your drink
getting spiked, use one of these.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.997
Very clever. I see.
Pop it up the chuffer, do you?

11:06.582 --> 11:09.501
Board up the tradesman's entrance.
Keep out any randy Corns.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.713
- It goes on top of a bottle.
- That makes more sense.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.675
If this trip goes wrong,
I won't be there to protect you.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.594
Rosie, believe it or not, I am a grown man

11:19.762 --> 11:22.681
and I am perfectly capable
of looking after myself.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.766
- Lunchbox.
- You put in Dunkers.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.476
Yep.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.103
Bye.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.612
Konichiwa.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.702
Now do be careful, compadre.
And remember, this is not a stag do.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.121
Oi, willy wanker. One for the road?

11:47.081 --> 11:48.623
Look, sir.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.542
Oh, dear.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.170
Oh, shit.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.132
Right, guys, remember,
what happens on tour, stays on tour.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.342
Don't touch me. Let's go.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.264
- Lads, lads...
- Eeuw, it smells of wee.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.854
Susan, why do you got luggage?
This isn't the UKIP battle bus.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.022
Joe is only going if I come too.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.443
Right. Is this some kind of sick joke?
Fraser?

12:17.528 --> 12:19.070
Fraser?

12:19.989 --> 12:22.657
No. No way. This is not happening.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.705
She is not coming with us. This is
a school trip, not a bloody Saga tour.

12:25.870 --> 12:29.080
The gloves are off. Glasses, on.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.793
- What the hell are those?
- It's wearable tech.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.255
I will use this device to record
your every move.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.508
If you put one foot out of line...

12:41.010 --> 12:45.221
...I will terminate this trip
with extreme prejudice!

12:46.849 --> 12:48.725
Bullshit!

12:48.893 --> 12:51.603
Stupid woman. Stupid bloody glasses.

12:54.815 --> 12:58.318
Go Glasses, show me
traffic updates for the A303.

12:58.486 --> 13:02.155
What are those glasses? Looks like
she'll give a TED talk on the menopause.

13:02.323 --> 13:06.951
First stop on Mr Wickers'
fabulous itinerary. The Eden Project.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.703
What?!

13:11.874 --> 13:16.836
Over on my left,
we have the world's largest spade.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.755
Wow!

13:24.637 --> 13:29.015
I can't believe we've driven
6 hours to see a garden centre.

13:29.183 --> 13:33.728
- I think I've been bitten.
- Oi, mate, where's the skunk?

13:37.817 --> 13:41.402
Dick!
No! Get off!

13:42.947 --> 13:44.489
Watch it.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.372
Hey! I wouldn't eat that.
Purging buckthorn, nature's laxative.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.499
You'll have a storm blast
so hard out your bum

13:54.667 --> 13:58.086
they'll be finding bodies up in the
trees for weeks.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.509
Thank you God.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.263
This trip was meant to be
about creating memories.

14:08.430 --> 14:12.225
No-one's gonna look back: "Ooh, do you
remember the time we saw a big spade?".

14:18.607 --> 14:20.358
Please!

14:22.820 --> 14:25.613
- Please, Susan, for the love of God.
- Fine!

14:25.781 --> 14:28.199
- Yes!
- But it will only end in tears.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.703
God, woman. It's just a zipwire.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.540
Come on, sir.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.835
Oh God, this is high.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.132
You'll be okay.
Just remember not to scream.

14:44.675 --> 14:48.636
We had a guy once who choked
on his own tongue. Ready?

14:48.804 --> 14:50.930
Oh God, I've changed my mind.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.891
Get on with it, you tart!

14:57.021 --> 14:58.730
Mitchell!

15:16.206 --> 15:19.000
Sorry!

15:27.509 --> 15:30.887
Help, Susan.
Susan. Help.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.681
Go Glasses, take photo.

15:33.849 --> 15:39.562
Send to group email marked 'the PTA'.
Subject heading: strike one.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.691
My willy's gone inside me.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.618
We have got to ditch the bitch.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.833
Shitty shitty bang bang.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.838
Mrs Poulter,
are those glasses voice activated?

16:06.006 --> 16:07.256
Yes, Mitchell.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.510
- Go Glasses...
- Not when I'm driving.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.428
...search 'two girls, one cup'.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.138
Oh!

16:15.975 --> 16:18.226
You revolting little boy, sit back down!

16:21.480 --> 16:24.190
Penleven Castle was built by Henry VI.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.610
And in the Cornish rebellion of 1497

16:27.778 --> 16:32.240
the castle withstood a siege
for over 5 months.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.410
- Mate, look, a witch.
- It's a nun, you tit.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.881
Arnie, Dieter, Gunter, Helga,
Helma, Ulla und Rem Hund.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.176
Any questions, my children?

16:53.470 --> 16:56.472
Who build that castle?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.725
Does anyone have any questions?

17:00.477 --> 17:02.645
Well, come on. Anything?!

17:03.397 --> 17:06.773
- Oh, dear.
- Where's the G-spot?
- Would you rather have no arms or no legs?

17:06.942 --> 17:09.781
- What's a haggis?
- Who would win in a fight,
Gandalf or Dwayne Johnson?

17:09.819 --> 17:11.362
Obviously Gandalf. He's magic.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.530
Stop!

17:12.656 --> 17:14.741
If a chicken had sex with a pig,
could it lay a Scotch egg?

17:14.907 --> 17:16.748
- Do you get a boner when you drown?
- Correct.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.589
Susie, have you ever heard of conditioner?

17:18.662 --> 17:20.704
I meant questions about the castle!

17:22.040 --> 17:26.085
There seems to be a priest hole that
smugglers turned into a secret passageway.

17:26.252 --> 17:29.380
Can we see it as it sounds
mildly less shit than this church?

17:29.548 --> 17:31.174
There's no smugglers' passageway.

17:31.341 --> 17:35.470
There is. I read about it on the internet.
It goes down to the beach.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.889
Sir wants to see your back passage.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.724
Shut up, you little toad!

17:44.188 --> 17:46.355
This is Cornwall's most sacred relic

17:46.523 --> 17:50.485
brought back from the Crusades
and believed to possess

17:50.652 --> 17:53.196
miraculous healing powers.

17:53.572 --> 17:57.742
Behold, the prepuce of
Saint John the Baptist.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.579
- What's a prepuce?
- A foreskin.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.748
Eugh!

18:05.125 --> 18:07.627
Eugh, they're praying
to a bit of old willy?

18:07.795 --> 18:11.923
A 2,000 year old holy relic which
sheathed the Baptist's phallus.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.516
Excuse me. Could you please
take me to the nearest WC?

18:21.683 --> 18:25.478
- I'm required to remain in this room.
- Take me to a toilet!

18:25.896 --> 18:29.357
- Well, we might hit up the cafe.
- No, you stay here.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.652
This whole trip can't be dictated
by your bowel movements.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.489
If you just sit here quietly
for 5 minutes, I will...

18:37.157 --> 18:39.700
- I'll let you have some free time.
- Deal!

18:40.285 --> 18:41.953
Quickly, move out of the way!

18:42.121 --> 18:45.039
Did you hear that, guys?
Free time means pub crawl.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.836
All you've got to do
is behave for 5 minutes.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.923
- Mitchell!
- I just wanted to make a wish.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.175
It's not a fucking genie!

18:58.011 --> 19:00.680
Oh my God.
The foreskin, where is it?

19:01.348 --> 19:02.890
Shit. Help, help.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.934
Oh my God.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.228
What's going on? I heard a crash.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.609
Oh, dear.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.444
- Where?
- Through here.

19:15.612 --> 19:19.157
Come on, boy. Come on, give it!

19:20.701 --> 19:22.535
What are you doing to my dog?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.375
Much better.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.339
- Quickly! Hurry!
- She's coming back!

19:36.884 --> 19:38.509
Everybody freeze!

19:39.052 --> 19:43.556
Where is the prepuce? Hands where
I can see them! Need to search you all.

19:44.558 --> 19:48.060
What's that in your hand, Mr Wickers?
Show me your hands!

19:50.439 --> 19:51.981
Both of them!

19:53.317 --> 19:54.859
Fuck.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.452
Turn round now!

20:08.123 --> 20:10.541
Would you care to explain
what the hell is going on?

20:10.709 --> 20:14.378
Well, come on. Speak!

20:22.763 --> 20:24.305
Hey, I got it.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.312
See? Foreskin, innit.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.565
Well, boy, what were you doing with it?

20:35.776 --> 20:40.071
Little man wanted a miracle.
So he gave it a rub and now he can walk.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.925
When we getting lunch? Or are
you full after that ancient dick you ate?

21:01.760 --> 21:05.930
- Where the hell are we?
- The fishing town of Port Jago.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.557
Drink in that crisp sea air.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.686
- Smells of minge.
- Like you'd know.

21:11.853 --> 21:16.524
- Is he related to Atticus?
- His dad. The local MP. Bit Marmite.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.860
- Do you think they've got a McDonald's?
- No, Joe, I don't.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.948
I think we're in a creepy little town
in the middle of buttfuck nowhere.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.367
That's a genuine sign.

21:26.743 --> 21:30.746
Young lady, Cornwall is not
some mediaeval backwater.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.666
It is a modern, cosmopolitan county

21:33.834 --> 21:37.586
with both feet planted firmly
in the 21st century.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.005
Um, guys...

21:46.847 --> 21:49.098
What the fuck?

21:49.266 --> 21:54.061
This is the Port Jago Summer
Solstice parade. There's the hobby horse.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.814
Come do the bridal dance
with the horse, young virgin.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.984
- Virgin? You're barking up
the wrong tree there.
- Shut up.

22:00.152 --> 22:04.155
Shall we get going before the pantomime
horse knocks up one of the kids?

22:08.618 --> 22:11.620
Got nowt under Wickers, my lovely.

22:13.540 --> 22:17.668
I do have 8 rooms for the
Dusseldorf Academy der Kunste?

22:17.836 --> 22:20.463
Yeah, that's us. Guten Tag.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.341
Can we go on a helicopter tour?

22:23.508 --> 22:27.345
No need. I've arranged a
very special treat for us tonight.

22:28.096 --> 22:31.098
We are on a VIP guest list

22:33.352 --> 22:38.356
to visit the leader of the Cornish
rebellion, Michael An Gof's grave.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.403
That's a treat?
We're going to a graveyard?

22:44.821 --> 22:46.739
Right, what happened to our free time?

22:46.907 --> 22:50.659
You didn't seriously think I would
let you run amok in this town?

22:50.827 --> 22:53.037
Fine! You know what, you win.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.999
I admit, this trip is a write-off.
But I'm warning you, Susan,

22:57.167 --> 22:59.543
when they leave school,
I'm gonna take them on a holiday

22:59.711 --> 23:05.007
so batshit mental - if it was a movie,
everyone would be played by Nicolas Cage.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.967
When they leave school?

23:07.135 --> 23:10.054
Yes. When they leave school.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.349
They haven't told you.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.522
Guys, what's going on?

23:20.565 --> 23:23.526
We're leaving, sir.
Well, we've left.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.654
But... where?

23:26.822 --> 23:30.658
- Beauty school. - Brit school.
- Anywhere that ain't school.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.494
Joe?

23:36.581 --> 23:39.125
He is going to
a sixth form college.

23:39.292 --> 23:42.670
One as far away from you
as is humanly possible.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.424
Chop-chop. Bus leaves in 5 minutes.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.984
- Why didn't you tell me?
- We didn't wanna ruin your trip.

24:05.152 --> 24:08.028
It's not my trip. It's our trip.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.657
You're right. And if this is
our last weekend together,

24:11.825 --> 24:14.910
do you wanna spend it sat here
sulking in this vile room?

24:15.078 --> 24:16.454
Don't let her win, sir.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.125
Yeah, you're right.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.963
I took a 2,000 year old bit of dick
so that we could go to the pub

24:26.131 --> 24:27.756
...and go to the pub we shall!

24:27.924 --> 24:29.467
Yes!

24:29.634 --> 24:31.510
How? She's got the exit covered.

24:37.934 --> 24:40.519
Who remembers studying
the siege of Troy?

24:41.188 --> 24:43.772
- Who's Troy?
- I dunno, but he sounds fit.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.934
The rich get richer.
The cuts get deeper.

25:20.101 --> 25:23.562
Hospitals are closing yet
Michael Hoye, our MP,

25:23.730 --> 25:26.106
has enough loose change to buy this pub
tear it down

25:26.274 --> 25:29.527
and build a gastroabomination
for his toff chums.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.530
We been through the courts,
signed the petitions.

25:33.156 --> 25:36.242
Let's face it, Russell Brand
ain't coming to save us.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.494
The Cornish Liberation Army's
dead in the water.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.121
We're the CLA. We don't give up.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.832
- Save it, Pasco. It's hopeless.
- Damn it, man.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.585
Cornwall needs independence.
Listen to reason.

25:46.753 --> 25:50.339
Call that plan of yours reason?
It's a suicide mission.

25:50.507 --> 25:54.301
You'd need the stupidest, most gullible
half-wit on God's green earth to...

25:54.469 --> 25:56.220
Party time!

26:06.815 --> 26:09.149
- Your shirt's inside out.
- Thanks.

26:09.317 --> 26:13.362
Now, remember, we're just
your average group of local farmers.

26:13.530 --> 26:17.074
- 8 Smirnoff Ices, babe.
- He means lager.

26:18.743 --> 26:22.788
We ain't London poofs.
We don't drink lager.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.541
Then I guess it's Pimm's O'Clock.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.545
You chaps lost?

26:33.049 --> 26:34.091
No.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.844
Oh, I think you are.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.723
Well I'll be damned.

26:41.641 --> 26:44.435
CLA man, are you?

26:44.603 --> 26:49.398
Yes, I am.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.567
Yes, I bloody am.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.819
CLA till I die. We all are.

26:53.987 --> 26:57.740
Well then, a round of ales
for our brothers in arms!

27:03.830 --> 27:06.749
Has anyone seen Keith's moustache?

27:07.667 --> 27:09.501
It's run away.

27:09.669 --> 27:12.713
- Does Port Jago have a gay scene?
- Well, there's gay Colin.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.885
- Your gay scene's one gay man?
- Colin's not actually a queer.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.304
He asked for a spritzer in 1984.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.852
Oh my God, this dicks all over Shagaluf.

27:27.437 --> 27:31.523
Mum's gonna find us here.
Can't we go to Atticus Hoye's house?

27:31.983 --> 27:35.027
It's not a hotel, Joe.
Can't just turn up when we want.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.029
The party's tomorrow.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.657
Mind if I take a pew?

27:40.367 --> 27:44.953
Barkeep, a pint of Betty Stogs
for my lover.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.705
Coming right up.

27:51.795 --> 27:55.464
Whoa, two steps back,
little Miss Marple. So...

27:55.632 --> 28:00.052
...these missing children are
on a school trip...

28:00.220 --> 28:04.515
...and they've disappeared
with their teacher. Is that it?

28:07.018 --> 28:11.188
Listen, pen-pusher.
If you do not assist me...

28:11.606 --> 28:17.152
I will hold you down whilst a negligence
tribunal straps on the rule book,

28:17.320 --> 28:20.906
strips you naked, parts your buttocks

28:21.074 --> 28:25.202
and buggers you into
a dishonourable discharge.

28:30.375 --> 28:34.378
Just... hold here...
can you hold your thing for a bit, please?

28:34.546 --> 28:37.131
- So you're an actual smuggler?
- Yes.

28:37.298 --> 28:41.510
Been Trevelyans smuggling since
the glory days of Prussia Cove

28:41.845 --> 28:45.389
and it ain't just cigars.
Booze, dirty playing cards...

28:45.849 --> 28:48.058
marital aids of all shapes and tastes.

28:48.226 --> 28:53.856
I got a deal with a sex shop in Bodmin.
Filthy bastards in Bodmin.

28:54.023 --> 28:57.276
Sir, scary Cornish dude. Tits and teeth.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.112
Police! Hide!

29:04.993 --> 29:08.579
- This door is just painted on the wall.
- Don't get many girls in here.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.680
Mr Trevelyan.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.683
How's tricks?

29:29.851 --> 29:33.645
Keeping busy, officer.
Devil makes work for idle hands.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.774
I'm looking for 7 children.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.984
This look like a nursery?

29:47.744 --> 29:51.997
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
It's an out-of-towner, is it?

29:54.459 --> 29:57.461
Oh, this lad's got Cornish blood
running through every vein.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.839
Meet my bastard son.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.092
Conceived in a moment of passion
in a faraway port.

30:06.137 --> 30:10.098
I'm just having a few ales here
with me old pa.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.810
That port being...

30:14.437 --> 30:16.814
...Kingston, Jamaica.

30:21.694 --> 30:27.491
Me gotta love the durty wine.
But me also love a little bit of fudge.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.287
The pasty and the rice and ting.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.962
Well, they're not in the pub.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.299
If you want something done right...

30:47.804 --> 30:49.680
Fitty, 2 o'clock.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.892
The bar.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.981
He so checked me out.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.650
Is that Phoebe Kendall?

31:02.277 --> 31:04.945
Oh my God, I sat next to her in class.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.406
- Shotgun.
- No-one is shotgunning her.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.908
- She's not a passenger seat.
- Use it or lose it.

31:10.076 --> 31:13.662
I'm not gonna use it.
I'm going to go over and say hello to it.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.289
Her.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.589
Work it, sailor.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.299
Gotcha!

31:32.098 --> 31:34.349
Phoebe Kendall.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.935
Of all the gin joints in all the world...

31:56.039 --> 31:57.623
I'll get you another.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.375
- Do I know you?
- Alfie Wickers.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.502
The Wickster.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.464
I had a panic attack at Prize Day.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.342
You're the guy that chundered on
Sir Steve Redgrave.

32:08.509 --> 32:11.511
Collecting the fencing cup.
I like to finish that story on a high.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.098
Yo, what's the deal with this guy?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.684
That would be Mick Gwynn.

32:17.852 --> 32:22.064
Says he'll buy a round for the man
who moves the blade quicker than he.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.399
Ain't got his wallet out for 30 year.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.277
Oh, yeah?

32:29.030 --> 32:31.239
- No, Alfie.
- Go on, sir.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.701
Yeah, go on, Albert.

32:40.792 --> 32:45.087
Please, for once, listen to me.
This is a terrible error of judgment.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.465
Joe, it's an old confidence trick.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.386
The blade's plastic.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.558
This shit about to get cray.

32:59.185 --> 33:02.688
This shit about to get fifty
shades of cray.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.653
Yo, gay Colin, hustler
needs your bandana.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.781
It's blindfolding time.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.412
My hand, my hand!

34:00.580 --> 34:03.498
Don't worry, buddy,
it's just a little flesh wound.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.503
We need alcohol to sterilise it.

34:10.505 --> 34:11.715
Not Guinness!

34:35.614 --> 34:37.324
Susan!

34:42.080 --> 34:44.623
Go upstairs and pack.
We leave at 7 a.m. sharp.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.875
- Hand in your telephones.
- You witch!

34:47.043 --> 34:48.210
Zip it, Dorothy!

34:49.754 --> 34:52.214
What am I gonna do
without my phone?

34:52.380 --> 34:54.507
Don't go on my Snapchat.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.845
There's no reception anyway.

34:59.013 --> 35:03.517
Indeed, Mr Wickers.
For you, a stay of execution.

35:03.684 --> 35:06.884
You know, instead of filming it, you could
have stopped your son getting stabbed.

35:07.772 --> 35:08.814
By me.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.607
But I didn't want to.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.736
After tonight, you will never teach again.

35:14.904 --> 35:17.531
Why are you so desperate
to get me fired?

35:17.698 --> 35:20.700
Come, Mr Wickers, dream a little bigger.

35:20.868 --> 35:22.869
You're not a Bond villain.

35:23.037 --> 35:27.082
No, the real challenge was this,
how to destroy a friendship.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.918
How can you do this to Joe?

35:30.294 --> 35:35.382
Because it is my job to protect him,
whether he likes it or not.

35:36.259 --> 35:40.470
I'm not some emotional retard who's
so desperate to be liked...

35:40.638 --> 35:44.933
...that he manipulates children into
a pathetic imitation of friendship!

35:45.101 --> 35:48.562
Presumably because he has
no real friends of his own!

35:51.649 --> 35:55.986
I think it might be best if you go home
separately tomorrow, Mr Wickers.

35:57.780 --> 36:01.408
We don't want to prolong
the tearful goodbyes.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.064
Steady, lad. Careful with her now.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.844
Hey, buddy. Do you want some vodka?

37:07.308 --> 37:09.351
Really sorry for stabbing you.

37:11.437 --> 37:14.314
It's fine. I'll have a cool scar.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.149
I think I just freaked out a bit.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.610
You guys leaving and...

37:18.778 --> 37:21.363
Look, I'm not definitely leaving.

37:21.530 --> 37:26.243
The sixth form college say I need Cs
in English, Maths and History, so...

37:26.410 --> 37:29.037
Well you might fail History. I taught you.

37:31.249 --> 37:35.335
I guess we've just gotta hope and pray
that you fuck that exam.

37:36.045 --> 37:37.754
Yeah, touch wood.

37:39.423 --> 37:43.426
Sorry my mum ruined the trip. Everyone
was so excited about the house party.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.639
About your mum.

37:48.516 --> 37:52.769
What would you say to her being slipped
some crushed-up sleeping pills

37:52.937 --> 37:56.022
popped in a trunk, given to some smugglers
and dumped in France?

37:56.190 --> 37:58.817
No! Absolutely not.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.695
You do realise she is my actual mother?

38:03.114 --> 38:05.991
Joe, Joe, Joe...

38:06.158 --> 38:09.619
Do you really think
I would have told you all of this

38:09.787 --> 38:12.372
if the wheels weren't already in motion?

38:18.254 --> 38:21.047
Alfie, are you insane?

38:23.551 --> 38:28.388
She'll be fine. Pasco is gonna be
extra careful with her. He promised me.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.849
What? The guy you just met
promised you?

38:31.017 --> 38:34.686
She's filming everything on her glasses.
She'll destroy you.

38:36.355 --> 38:38.064
Now, let's get our story straight.

38:38.232 --> 38:41.651
I reckon the Suster lands up in France
after an all-night Shagathon

38:41.819 --> 38:45.113
with a really, really desperate fisherman.
Capiche?

38:45.281 --> 38:46.656
Unbelievable.

38:46.824 --> 38:49.326
Ding dong the witch is dead.
What we gonna do now?

38:51.203 --> 38:52.871
Who's up for a strip club?

39:12.391 --> 39:14.934
There you go, my lovelies.

39:17.355 --> 39:22.192
So, this Hoye shindig.
Reckon you can get me past security?

39:22.360 --> 39:25.445
Might be tricky. Already taking a plus 7.

39:25.780 --> 39:29.074
Only your pal Atticus has put in
a little order with me.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.659
Party supplies, if you know what I mean.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.912
Classic Atticus.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.082
Problem is, I'm a watched man
in these parts.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.085
I can't make a delivery
with that heat on me.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.088
Well, I could deliver it.

39:43.255 --> 39:45.131
What, you'd do that for me?

39:46.759 --> 39:48.301
You did me a favour.

39:48.844 --> 39:51.679
I feel so lucky to have a pal like you.

39:55.935 --> 39:59.938
Please welcome Port Jago's finest dancer.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.941
Brace yourself for Peggy Sue.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.417
Right, I can't watch this any more.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.045
- I'm sick of seeing this.
- Put them away.

40:24.922 --> 40:29.259
So, it turns out the
CLA is a Cornish cartel

40:29.427 --> 40:31.136
and Pasco is a drug baron.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.763
- We're leaving.
- He has asked very sweetly

40:33.931 --> 40:38.184
if I/we could pop over a
teeny bit of weed to the party tomorrow.

40:39.395 --> 40:43.189
Come on, Jing. He did me a favour. You
know the saying, 'I scratch your back ...'

40:43.357 --> 40:45.567
You turn 7 children into drug mules?

40:47.111 --> 40:51.698
It's not like we're smoking any of it.
We're just delivering it. Like Ocado.

40:53.325 --> 40:59.289
Guys, time for a little life lesson. Who
is the most popular guy at a house party?

40:59.665 --> 41:02.083
- The guy with the bongos?
- No, Joe.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.793
He's the least popular person.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.421
The guy with the supply.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.852
- Not with the arse.
- Oh my God!

41:38.120 --> 41:39.662
My coccyx!

41:52.676 --> 41:55.011
Joe, Joe, Joe...

42:14.240 --> 42:16.115
Wickers!

42:18.536 --> 42:20.370
We've got a situation, people.

42:20.538 --> 42:24.165
I have told the PE teacher
a million times. Touch rugby, fine.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.167
Touch swimming, letters.

42:26.335 --> 42:30.046
We've lost contact with the Cornwall trip
and the PTA want answers, fast.

42:30.214 --> 42:33.007
Alfie has enraged the
deadliest enemy of them all.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.927
- Women of a certain age.
- Correct.

42:36.095 --> 42:38.721
Mumsnet have put down their massive
glasses of wine

42:38.889 --> 42:40.431
and picked up their pitchforks.

42:40.599 --> 42:42.392
Then we need to find him before they do.

42:42.560 --> 42:46.521
We've got 24 hours until those children
are legally classified as missing.

42:46.689 --> 42:50.942
Martino, soup up your thermos
and grab your Best of Shakin' Stevens.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.403
It's road trippin' time.

42:56.323 --> 43:00.326
Ah, Woody Bay beach.
I used to catch crabs there every summer.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.329
I wonder if Alice Hubble
still works there?

43:04.248 --> 43:08.459
Look, this isn't a jolly.
Alfie's future is in our hands.

43:10.588 --> 43:14.007
Can you stop playing Christmas music?
It's fucking June.

43:16.343 --> 43:19.929
Wrong time of the month
for Christmas music.

43:33.902 --> 43:35.570
Guys, wake up.

43:38.782 --> 43:42.910
Sorry I had to scarper,
time and tide wait for no man.

43:43.245 --> 43:44.912
Now listen very carefully.

43:45.080 --> 43:49.208
Outside you'll find a van
with a package inside for tonight's party.

43:49.376 --> 43:52.378
When you want me to pick you up,
call this number.

43:52.755 --> 43:55.131
Your mate, Pasco.

43:58.802 --> 44:02.013
I spy with my little eye...

44:02.640 --> 44:05.850
...something beginning with S.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.560
Rhymes with...

44:09.146 --> 44:10.772
...brie.

44:11.523 --> 44:13.483
- Sea?
- Correct.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.610
- Do another one.
- I spy...

44:15.778 --> 44:19.280
...with my little eye
something beginning with...

44:20.491 --> 44:27.163
...S again.
Rhymes with... breering wheel.

44:28.123 --> 44:29.666
- Steering wheel?
- Correct.

44:29.833 --> 44:34.420
Please, put the music on!
Put the fucking music back on!

44:56.485 --> 44:59.862
Angleterre? Merci, merci.

45:36.567 --> 45:39.986
Hi. Excuse me, those policemen...

45:40.154 --> 45:42.613
Looking for a teacher
what put a woman in a box.

45:42.781 --> 45:45.867
Police say he's been mixing
with undesirables.

45:47.119 --> 45:48.786
Look, a helicopter tour.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.748
And who are these undesirables?

45:53.417 --> 45:56.461
- Pasco.
- Will you keep your mouth shut, Tom?!

45:57.546 --> 46:01.299
- Where can I find this Pasco?
- Wherever the wind takes him.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.218
Anything I could put into Google Maps?

46:04.386 --> 46:07.388
Wherever he lays his hat is his home.

46:09.349 --> 46:11.100
Strip club.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.604
Yo Ho Ho's or Teaser's Palace?

46:28.202 --> 46:30.077
Susan, what are you doing?

46:30.245 --> 46:31.871
Raising an army.

46:47.721 --> 46:50.431
It's like a castle.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.725
I thought you said
your mate lived on an estate.

48:02.838 --> 48:07.216
Well, Dick Shittington,
if it isn't Alfie Wickers.

48:08.427 --> 48:10.177
Great to see you, mate.

48:11.471 --> 48:14.599
Guys, meet your host, Mr Atticus Hoye.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.018
Mi casa tu casa.

48:17.185 --> 48:19.729
Sorry, bruv, we don't speak Hogwarts.

48:20.981 --> 48:24.525
- So where are your folks?
- Daddy doesn't really do Cornwall.

48:24.693 --> 48:29.530
Doesn't like getting the Aston dirty.
How about you, bro? Still fencing?

48:30.407 --> 48:32.533
God, I miss going tip-to-tip with you.

48:36.538 --> 48:38.539
Ooh, here comes trouble.
Here's the lads.

48:38.707 --> 48:42.585
Ludo, The Shep, Digby,
Orlando, Tarquin and Dave.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.045
Short for Earl of Daventry.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.839
Toby-Jug is absolutely mullered.

48:47.007 --> 48:50.718
He just took Binky down to the ha-ha
and spooged on her pashmina.

48:50.886 --> 48:53.179
Do these guys come with subtitles?

48:53.347 --> 48:56.432
- Classic pube or dare.
- What's pube or dare?

48:56.600 --> 48:58.517
Either you do a dare or one
of the lads holds you down

48:58.685 --> 49:00.603
and rips out a handful of your pubes.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.855
It's a very famous parlour game.

49:03.023 --> 49:05.066
Live by the pube, die by the pube.

49:05.233 --> 49:07.610
You must have told them about Shagaluf?

49:07.778 --> 49:10.529
Literally the funniest pube or dare ever.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.114
Shall we get a drink?

49:12.282 --> 49:16.577
So basically me and the boys booked
Shagaluf. And then this knobber...

49:17.579 --> 49:22.124
Wait, sorry, man, I'm totally raping your
vibe. This is your story, you tell it.

49:22.292 --> 49:24.001
- Do I...
- Tell it, Dickers.

49:26.964 --> 49:30.216
Well, the guys thought
it would be really funny

49:30.384 --> 49:33.844
to tell me that our leavers' trip
was to Sierra Leone.

49:34.012 --> 49:36.013
So my dad booked me a flight there.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.265
Boys went to Spain.

49:38.433 --> 49:40.643
I had a lovely week in Bumbuna.

49:42.270 --> 49:43.980
He got ebola.

49:44.147 --> 49:46.107
- Nearly died.
- Jokes.

49:46.274 --> 49:49.902
- How is that a dare?
- They dared me not to tell my parents.

49:52.614 --> 49:55.408
Could I have a quick word?
Sorry, it's just...

49:57.244 --> 50:00.538
Just to say, your delivery is out front.

50:01.039 --> 50:03.040
Pasco sends his regards.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.626
Right.

50:07.963 --> 50:09.505
Oh dear.

50:10.048 --> 50:11.590
Pube or dare?

50:11.758 --> 50:16.137
Pube or dare? Pube or dare?
Pube or dare?

50:37.284 --> 50:42.163
Sorry to cock block the hoonage
but Mr Alfred Wickers...

50:42.914 --> 50:45.416
...is about to make pube or dare history.

51:04.811 --> 51:08.272
- What are you making him do exactly?
- Teabag a swan.

51:09.649 --> 51:11.734
Well, this got weird quickly.

51:41.306 --> 51:43.974
This is the stuff of legend.

51:51.983 --> 51:53.609
Smile!

52:13.547 --> 52:15.089
Sir, stay still!

52:16.883 --> 52:18.175
Mitchell!

52:18.343 --> 52:22.221
Lord. Sheppy, put him out of his misery.

52:22.389 --> 52:24.515
Sheppy incoming!

52:28.937 --> 52:31.397
Right, hey, gang. Everyone back inside.

52:31.565 --> 52:33.607
Monty's gonna play his bongos.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.592
Are your mates always that mean to you?

52:59.759 --> 53:03.304
It's called character-building, Joe.
It's a public school thing.

53:14.107 --> 53:16.483
Hey. That was jokes.

53:17.485 --> 53:19.737
Do you wanna coch with me,
smash a doobie?

53:20.447 --> 53:24.366
Yeah. Wanna smash that doobie so hard
it goes to stay

53:24.534 --> 53:27.620
with its mother until
I agree to get counselling.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.873
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

53:42.093 --> 53:43.844
Babe...

53:47.015 --> 53:49.058
So, you and Atticus...

53:49.893 --> 53:55.147
Oh, it's chill. I mean, we sleep together
but we're not exclusive.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.192
Yeah, I mean, I totally dig.

53:58.693 --> 54:00.861
I had a similar situation going on.

54:01.738 --> 54:07.284
Not with Atticus, obviously. Although,
sometimes after fencing practice, we...

54:08.578 --> 54:11.080
Wait here. I've got you a surprise.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.227
Phoebe?

54:35.480 --> 54:37.022
Phoebe?

54:42.320 --> 54:44.363
These poor, poor women.

54:45.949 --> 54:50.661
We would find Alfie so much quicker
if only we had a bird's-eye view.

54:51.997 --> 54:54.039
What was Alfie doing in here?

54:54.207 --> 54:56.834
- Hello, stranger.
- Hello, total stranger.

54:57.002 --> 54:58.961
Must be confusing me
with someone else.

55:00.255 --> 55:03.132
Martin Wickers, as I live and breathe.

55:03.300 --> 55:04.508
Usual, squire?

55:05.468 --> 55:08.220
Excuse me. Hi. We're looking for a man.

55:08.388 --> 55:12.224
6 foot 1, blue eyes,
thick Jamaican accent?

55:12.392 --> 55:13.934
I think you'd better come with us.

55:18.481 --> 55:19.940
Evening.

55:20.108 --> 55:21.650
See you, mate.

55:30.201 --> 55:33.287
- Did you see his face?
- It's classic Dickers, babe.

55:37.334 --> 55:38.834
Where's sir?

55:39.002 --> 55:40.502
Alfie?

55:40.670 --> 55:43.797
- FML, Chantelle, you're my BFF.
- Stop talking like a text message!

55:43.965 --> 55:46.675
- You stole my man!
- Babe, he is gay!

55:46.843 --> 55:48.218
That's not the point!

55:48.386 --> 55:50.721
Guys, I'm over here.

55:55.310 --> 55:56.810
Got cabbaged.

55:57.562 --> 55:58.645
Brilliant.

55:58.813 --> 56:00.814
Let me guess. Public school thing?

56:01.441 --> 56:02.816
Yeah.

56:04.736 --> 56:07.780
Please tell me you can see
they ain't your mates, bruv.

56:07.947 --> 56:10.574
- What are you on about?
- You're being bullied, sir.

56:11.659 --> 56:13.577
Seriously, pube or dare?

56:13.745 --> 56:15.954
Let me tell you something
about pube or dare.

56:16.122 --> 56:20.000
Yes, every time The Shep yanked out
a fistful of my pubic hair, it hurt.

56:20.168 --> 56:22.127
But at least they wanted
to hang out with me.

56:22.295 --> 56:24.046
It's always about you, isn't it?

56:24.214 --> 56:27.049
Always about me?
You're the selfish ones for abandoning me.

56:27.217 --> 56:31.220
- Some more selfish than others.
- Get over yourself. I am no accessory.

56:31.388 --> 56:34.139
Can we go in? I was about to get
nuts deep in some posh bird.

56:34.307 --> 56:36.183
- Shut up.
- This holiday wasn't about us.

56:36.351 --> 56:39.686
You used us as an excuse to relive a trip
that you didn't even go on.

56:39.854 --> 56:41.897
- Who wants a kebab?
- Stop protecting him!

56:42.065 --> 56:44.400
Don't have a go at Joe
just for being loyal, Jing!

56:44.567 --> 56:48.153
Oh, you helmet. If he's so loyal, how
come he's had a history tutor all year?

56:52.826 --> 56:54.451
What?

56:56.121 --> 56:57.287
Please don't overreact.

56:57.455 --> 56:59.748
You've been seeing another man
behind my back?

57:01.000 --> 57:03.085
- Who is he?
- It didn't mean anything.

57:03.253 --> 57:04.795
What would you say if I was like

57:04.963 --> 57:08.799
"After school, I pay for another boy
to come round and be my special friend?".

57:08.967 --> 57:11.260
I'd totally buy that.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.429
I am sick of all you traitors!

57:14.973 --> 57:18.350
- Alfie, what are you doing?
- I am calling Pasco.

57:18.810 --> 57:21.520
The only person that I can trust.

57:37.996 --> 57:39.246
Get in!

57:50.049 --> 57:53.802
The explosion
at Tory MP Michael Hoye's house

57:53.970 --> 57:58.223
has been linked to an extremist group
fighting for Cornish independence.

57:58.391 --> 58:00.517
Did I just blow up my best friend's house?

58:00.685 --> 58:04.563
Oh, you did more than that, brother.
The fire rises.

58:11.446 --> 58:15.157
- Are you gonna kill us?
- Oh, you're no use to me dead.

58:15.325 --> 58:17.784
Right. Who are you?

58:17.952 --> 58:23.123
Pasco Trevelyan. Head of militant
Cornish Nationalist group the CLA.

58:23.291 --> 58:24.958
The Cornish Liberation Army.

58:25.126 --> 58:27.794
- And you are?
- Interpol. Counter-terrorism.

58:27.962 --> 58:30.756
Now for years, we thought
the CLA lay dormant.

58:30.924 --> 58:35.093
Tonight, all that changed,
thanks to this man.

58:35.887 --> 58:37.638
Intelligence indicates that

58:37.805 --> 58:40.807
Wickers has been radicalised
by a Cornish preacher of hate.

58:40.975 --> 58:43.227
Alfie? He hasn't got
a violent bone in his body.

58:43.394 --> 58:45.896
The Alfie Wickers you knew is dead.

58:46.064 --> 58:48.607
Why, God?!

58:48.775 --> 58:51.193
Right, that was a figure of speech.
As you were.

58:51.361 --> 58:52.986
Thankfully there were no fatalities.

58:53.613 --> 58:56.949
That doesn't change the cold hard fact
that Wickers is a terrorist.

58:57.116 --> 59:00.869
And we need to know everything.
Who he talks to. What he reads.

59:01.037 --> 59:03.872
Does he have any links
with the Middle East?

59:04.040 --> 59:05.582
Oh, he likes falafel.

59:05.750 --> 59:08.752
Likes falafel.

59:12.173 --> 59:16.927
We've hacked into a social media account
connected to the suspect's terror cell.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.429
Terror cell? What, you mean his class?

59:23.226 --> 59:24.601
Well, that doesn't prove anything.

59:42.328 --> 59:45.122
Pasco... look, take me, not them.

59:45.290 --> 59:48.250
They're just kids. Look, at least
let me just call their parents.

59:53.923 --> 59:57.843
- They could be tracking us.
- I mean, it has an airplane mode.

59:59.053 --> 01:00:00.596
I hadn't backed up.

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.222
Move!

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:06.602
You're right. They might be looking for us
which is why we should act as a decoy.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:10.564
They may be looking, petal.
But they'll be looking in the wrong place.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:13.609
I sent them on a merry goose chase.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.819
Who are you people?

01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:19.615
The Cornish Liberation Army.

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:29.708
This was the scene earlier
in Cornwall.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.918
Sir, you're on the telly.

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:35.797
Yeah, I know. Wickers
was always a bit of a loner.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:39.551
You know, kept himself to himself.
Daddy, you never liked him, did you?

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:42.596
Always showing up at the house
pretending we'd invited him.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:46.725
We repeat. These men are
dangerous and should not be approached.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.769
If you have any information,
please call...

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:51.146
The revolution has begun.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:54.107
Best school trip ever.

01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:07.037
Time for Phase 2.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.747
Dare I ask what that entails?

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.875
I could set us up a petition
on change.org.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:14.753
We are gonna loose a tide of blood.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:19.007
- How does a revolution succeed?
- Peaceful negotiation.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.935
The armed seizure
of the means of production.

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:23.512
- Really?
- Yes, young Smee.

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:27.683
Control the money, control the people.
Then they'll have to listen to us.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.935
And what's Cornwall's biggest industry?

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.688
- Inbreeding? - Racism?
- Mullets? - Pasties?

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.064
Clotted cream?

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.901
- Tourism.
- Correct, Lotus Blossom.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:41.613
We're gonna take back this county's
most important attraction.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.323
Move out, lads!

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:57.754
The Eden Project. The CLA's next target.

01:01:57.922 --> 01:02:00.924
We've had it confirmed by a number
of sources from the local community.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:03.009
- Let me talk to him.
- Too late.

01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:05.512
His actions have left me only one option.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.264
Helicopter manhunt!

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:08.765
- Yes!
- No!

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:13.437
We need to neutralise that threat
before anyone else gets hurt.

01:02:14.313 --> 01:02:15.605
It's show time!

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:23.071
A real rain is coming and it's gonna wash
this county clean!

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.913
Confirming a positive ID matching
the suspect's description.

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.623
Move!

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:41.006
- Stand aside, move out the way!
- Move to the side of the path!

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.135
Welcome to the jungle.

01:02:58.232 --> 01:03:00.525
You can't use force. He has rights.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:17.375
Oh my God, it's them.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.174
Red Team in position.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.220
They're not going to the Eden Project!

01:03:28.387 --> 01:03:30.013
Permission to engage?

01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:35.727
It's not them, I tell you!

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.980
- What makes you so sure of that?
- Because I...

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.276
...feel it in my waters.

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:46.947
Engage at will!

01:03:47.114 --> 01:03:49.449
You can't! Alfie! Alfie!

01:03:50.284 --> 01:03:52.661
- Red Team engage.
- No!

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.666
You see, it's not him!

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:02.838
Scheiße!

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.428
Negative, sir, it's not our suspect.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:33.285
The castle is now closed.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.583
The castle is now...
Excuse me, sir.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:43.003
I said that the castle is now closed.
You can't...

01:04:46.632 --> 01:04:48.216
This is a lock-in!

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.137
Let the games begin.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:57.559
They're at Penleven Castle!

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.978
Another tip-off from your waters, is it?

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:01.813
Escort this woman out of here.

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.983
- Take her away, boys.
- Right, get them all out!

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.613
Unhand me!
Joe's got a chip in his neck.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.072
What?

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:14.075
A few years ago, Joe had his appendix out.

01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:18.163
Whilst he was under I had them
pop a chip in his neck.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.002
- He's not a dog, Susan.
- A lot of mothers do it!

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.172
Don't they?

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:44.314
All of Cornwall is here. Young, old,
men, women. White...

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.193
You've united the clans.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:51.947
Pasco was right,
the CLA needed new blood.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:55.408
You're exciting, brave,
and you don't have buggers' grips.

01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:58.244
Look, I'd love to be your Che Guevara.

01:05:58.412 --> 01:06:01.456
The only slight problem is,
I'm not actually Cornish.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:05.210
Che Guevara wasn't actually Cuban.
He was born in Argentina.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:06.962
Would you give it a rest?

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:10.006
I tricked you into planting the bomb,
but they don't know that.

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:14.386
We got the fortress, soldiers,
weeks of supplies.

01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:17.472
We can see this through
to the last drop of blood.

01:06:18.265 --> 01:06:21.393
All we need is a charismatic leader.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.062
Yeah, right.
You keep using this word 'leader'...

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.523
Speak to them. Inspire them.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:31.069
I hear the Jihadiwaddys tell their lot
they'll get a 72 year old virgin.

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:34.114
It's 72 virgins.

01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:36.574
See? That's why you're good at this.

01:06:38.619 --> 01:06:40.704
Okay, fine. I'll speak to them.

01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:44.207
Before I do, maybe you could go on,
get the crowd warmed up a bit?

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.584
Then I'll come on and knock it
out the park.

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:48.253
You're the boss.

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:51.423
People of Cornwall.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.717
Right, come on, we're getting out of here.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.849
Sir, where the hell are we going?!

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.560
I've got this.
They've barricaded us in,

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:05.562
so I need to send out a distress signal.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:06.855
Stand back.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:10.233
The hour of reckoning is upon us!

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:14.863
It's time to rid ourselves of those
Westminster bastards once and for all!

01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:21.119
Look, our leader is burning
the symbol of the oppressor.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.163
Alfie.

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:25.040
No, I wasn't.

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:26.750
It was a mistake.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:29.836
- Alfie, Alfie, Alfie...
- Stop chanting.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.088
I didn't mean to.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:36.426
Alfie, Alfie, Alfie...

01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:48.897
Sorry. Sorry.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.420
- Are we gonna die, sir?
- Of course not.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:15.381
But just in case we do...

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.719
...I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:22.346
You were right about Atticus and that lot.

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:24.390
They aren't my friends.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.893
You guys are.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.979
And now I'm losing you.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.899
We're all in the same boat, sir.
It's not just you.

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:38.029
We're saying goodbye to each other.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:45.537
I'm sorry for all those things
I said, babe.

01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:48.872
I was embarrassed and
I took it out on you. BFFs?

01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:53.294
BFFs. Oh God,
I look so minging when I cry.

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:57.799
What have I done?
I'm literally the worst teacher ever.

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.218
You're a great teacher.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.470
Different, but great.

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:08.685
Yes. You taught us things we weren't
never not going to learn nowhere else.

01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:13.148
Wow, that was like a
quadruple negative...

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:15.524
...but thanks.

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:20.404
Every day at school
I was bullied or ignored.

01:09:21.615 --> 01:09:26.286
But... your classroom
was the only place I always felt safe.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:33.667
You're the first person to make me feel
like I was somebody worth talking to.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:41.634
I'm a virgin.

01:09:44.054 --> 01:09:46.805
No shit.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.893
Hang on. You all knew?

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.395
Sir, I'm scared.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:55.398
Don't worry.

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:59.027
Look, just think of all of this
as one big Class Wars.

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:04.574
That's it! Class Wars!

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:08.036
This is a siege.
And how do we end a siege?

01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:12.707
A blockade.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:45.073
We've cut off your food,
your water and your communication.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.616
The revolution is over.

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:48.826
Hashtag sorry not sorry.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.374
Look, mate, I agree with a lot
of what you're saying.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:58.294
Yes, the system's cringe,
austerity's bullshit...

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:01.464
...and of course Cornwall
deserves a voice.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:05.343
But you're not gonna change any of that
by kidnapping my kids...

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:12.016
Any minute now, the police
are gonna make their move...

01:11:12.184 --> 01:11:15.728
...and we are gonna fight
for our freedom to the death.

01:11:15.896 --> 01:11:17.981
Could you just let go of my neck?

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:23.569
All those people out there
believe in Alfie Wickers.

01:11:24.196 --> 01:11:26.531
So you can either play your part...

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:29.909
...or what does every revolution need?

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.287
A martyr.

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.997
Damn your tutor.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:38.876
Once again, young Smee is right.
A revolution needs a martyr.

01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:43.756
And I'll nail you to the cross myself
if it means Cornish liberation.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.508
So...

01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:47.802
...what will it be?

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:51.264
What was the first one again?

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.693
There are kids in there.
Nobody does anything till I say so.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.653
The world's media is watching.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:09.240
We wouldn't rule out the use of
unmanned drones. Next question.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:12.243
- Who are you?
- For the purposes of your articles,

01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:14.579
just call me the white Luther.

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:17.415
Somebody shut him up.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.591
Time to tool up.
I brought these over in the boat.

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:31.012
Some serious artillery from our
fellow freedom fighters in ETA.

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.184
Oh, bollocks.

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.023
I must have sent the wrong crate
to Bodmin.

01:12:45.944 --> 01:12:48.321
Oh my God, we're all gonna die.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:51.032
Shit, man, I think Joe's gone loco.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.201
Guys, look.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.166
Our mums are here to pick us up.

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:12.053
- We've got to get out of here now.
- How?

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:15.181
Seriously, mate,
what the hell are you doing?

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.688
Smugglers' tunnel down to the beach.

01:13:22.856 --> 01:13:25.024
Does no-one listen to Alfie?

01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:31.489
Sir, how did you get past that troll?

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.826
Let's just say
I gave him a little present.

01:13:34.993 --> 01:13:37.036
You wanked him off?

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:39.539
What? No, I gave him my watch.

01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:41.290
Whatever.
Sir wanked off a giant.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:42.667
I didn't.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:45.837
Sir, look!
Our mums are here.

01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:48.297
Alfie.

01:13:48.465 --> 01:13:50.007
The tunnel. I knew it.

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:52.427
Down to the beach. We haven't got long.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:54.512
He was massive and sir wanked him off.

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:59.851
- What about you?
- If the CLA see you, you're screwed.

01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:03.098
- I've gotta create a distraction for you.
- You gonna wank off Pasco as well?

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:05.314
Right, can we just drop the wanking?

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:11.904
Good luck, mate. And if I don't make it
out of here alive, tell Rosie I love her.

01:14:13.657 --> 01:14:17.535
Oh, and... probably delete
my internet history. Thanks.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.996
Fuck, wait.

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:23.332
I've also got some magazines
in the shed. So... yeah.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.543
Hello?!

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:31.674
Right, can everyone
just listen to me, please?

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.555
Shots fired.
We're going in!

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.016
Get those people under cover.

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.525
I just wanted to say a few words.

01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:51.903
This ain't a wedding.

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:57.366
Before this weekend
I didn't know the difference

01:14:57.534 --> 01:14:59.535
between Cornwall and Devon.

01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:01.996
Bastards.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:05.249
But since then everything's changed.

01:15:06.126 --> 01:15:09.712
I discovered a county that is proud...

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.381
but unhappy

01:15:12.549 --> 01:15:17.762
because for too long you guys have
been taken for granted by the man.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:22.016
I'm here to tell you this.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.310
You don't need him!

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:27.772
And you know what,
when you walk out that door,

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.942
he is gonna see just how much
you do for him!

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:35.863
I'm talking fishing.
I'm talking drystone walling.

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:41.244
- I'm talking...
- Thatched roofs.

01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:42.787
Yes, thank you, Mick!

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:46.123
You lot can thatch the hell
out of a cottage!

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.210
But today isn't about building things...

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:52.630
...it is about tearing shit up!

01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:57.885
And that is why we need to fight!

01:15:58.053 --> 01:16:01.931
- Fight! - Fight!
- Fight! Fight for this love!

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:07.144
Because today's the day we tell
those English bastards

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:11.357
that they can take our lives
but they will never take ...!

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.818
Our pasties!

01:16:17.155 --> 01:16:19.031
Hurry up! Hurry!

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:25.413
This is Cornwall!

01:16:50.188 --> 01:16:54.483
In position.
Charge!

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:58.321
Hold the line!

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:34.273
Son of a bitch.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:38.861
Come back, you coward!

01:17:49.289 --> 01:17:50.831
En garde. Touche.

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.541
Ponce.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.040
Fuck.

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:45.302
- Mum.
- Oh my God.

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:52.268
Wait!

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:54.186
Chantelle, I'm here.

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:02.737
Oi, guys, help!

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.162
Come here!

01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:14.707
- Get off!
- Hey, you! Oi!

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.047
In loco parentis, motherfuckers.

01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:33.309
Come on, kids.

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:35.102
- Let's go.
- Quality.

01:20:34.871 --> 01:20:36.580
Et la!

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.376
Et la!

01:20:42.045 --> 01:20:45.214
That's a direct.
Technically I win.

01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:56.308
Look... Pasco...

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:59.728
No.

01:20:59.896 --> 01:21:00.938
Sorry.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:02.523
Please...

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:11.407
- Alfie! Up here.
- Alfredo!

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.786
- Come on, Alfie!
- Come on, Alf.

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:21.125
Closer!

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:23.294
Closer! Bring it down!

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:28.549
- Climb up.
- Come on, Alfie.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.801
- Lower.
- Come on, Alfie!

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:34.471
- Jump!
Come on, Alfie, you can do it, darling!

01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:42.313
Not again!

01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:02.791
What the fuck?

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:05.169
Sorry!

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:13.677
I think we should find
somewhere to land now.

01:22:13.845 --> 01:22:15.721
But we've paid for an hour.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.766
Fine. Killjoy.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.114
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:39.203
When I thought I was gonna die

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:42.206
you were the only thing
I couldn't bear to leave behind.

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:44.249
I thought I'd lost you.

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:46.043
I love you.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:48.963
Idiot.

01:22:54.177 --> 01:22:57.596
MP Michael Hoye has resigned
today following allegations

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:01.225
that he claimed on expenses
for a cheeky Nando's van.

01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:05.020
The Port Jago by-election has been billed
as an unofficial referendum

01:23:05.188 --> 01:23:06.647
for the Cornish people.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:10.818
And finally, today is results day for
students up and down the country.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:14.488
That's not yours, you dick.

01:23:36.761 --> 01:23:38.554
Well done, mate.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.183
Thanks, Alfie. For everything.

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:07.082
Remember...

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:11.920
Damn straight.

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:15.966
Oh my God.
Never show your mother that.

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:17.760
Okay, sorry.

01:24:18.261 --> 01:24:20.763
Okay, gang. Photo time.

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:31.106
Baby, I am so proud of you.
Mummy's so proud.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:34.485
Well done, well done...

01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:37.446
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I'm hiding in the leavers' photo.

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:40.616
As you do.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.827
Oi, sir.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.914
Little gift to say thank you.

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:49.416
Baked them myself.

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:52.586
Thanks, mate.
That's really sweet of you.

01:25:09.854 --> 01:25:12.231
Ah, young love.

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:15.984
Oh, bollocks.

01:25:17.862 --> 01:25:18.904
What?

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:22.116
He spiked the brownies.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.330
Alfie?

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:31.166
Alfie.
