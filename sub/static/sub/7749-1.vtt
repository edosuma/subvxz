00:01.300 --> 00:03.621
*

00:21.650 --> 00:24.380
Alicia.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.550
Yes?

00:27.590 --> 00:30.184
Would you want to run
for State's Attorney?

00:31.530 --> 00:33.225
What?

00:34.560 --> 00:37.267
Would you want to run
for State's Attorney?

00:37.300 --> 00:38.824
I... (laughs)

00:38.870 --> 00:40.167
No.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.566
Why not?
Why not? Eli,

00:42.610 --> 00:44.168
are you serious?

00:44.210 --> 00:46.303
Yes, I've been watching you
for the last five years.

00:46.340 --> 00:47.637
You'd be perfect.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.807
We need a woman,

00:49.850 --> 00:51.499
and people respect you.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.212
They like you...
I'm not a politician, Eli.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.286
But you have
political instincts.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.719
And you're a brand.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.785
You're St. Alicia.
Oh.

00:58.820 --> 01:00.617
Well, you said yourself
you want something new.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.082
The empty-nest syndrome.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.324
(water running)
Zach's gone now.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.089
Yes, and I have
another child.

01:05.130 --> 01:07.257
Is this about Peter?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.722
Did he tell you to ask me?

01:08.760 --> 01:10.296
No, no.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.422
Then, why are you doing this?

01:11.470 --> 01:13.335
I'm nev saying, "Yes."

01:14.600 --> 01:16.329
Because you could win.

01:16.370 --> 01:19.168
(phone rings)

01:19.210 --> 01:20.529
(turns off water)

01:20.580 --> 01:22.343
Hello?
CARY: Yeah, it's me.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.142
What's wrong?

01:23.180 --> 01:25.171
Nothing.
I-I think we need to talk.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.518
We did talk.

01:26.550 --> 01:28.415
You yelled at me.
I yelled at you.
Is it Peter?

01:28.450 --> 01:29.644
Diane called.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.385
She wants to meet tomorrow

01:31.420 --> 01:32.489
for breakfast
to talk over terms.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.612
Great. What time?

01:33.660 --> 01:35.685
No, I didn't say
that we would meet.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.827
She wants to bring us
$38 million in business.

01:39.860 --> 01:41.452
I don't see the downside.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.467
Losing our culture,

01:42.500 --> 01:43.797
co-opting ourselves

01:43.830 --> 01:46.230
by becoming Lockhart,
Florrick & Agos.

01:46.270 --> 01:47.669
So, we'll have the breakfast,

01:47.700 --> 01:50.430
and then we'll decide if we want
to be co-opted, okay?

01:50.470 --> 01:52.700
I'll call her, set it up.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.731
(phone beeps)

01:57.680 --> 01:59.511
(phone dialing)

01:59.550 --> 02:01.313
(sighs heavily)

02:03.620 --> 02:04.712
Hey. Where are you?

02:07.590 --> 02:08.852
Why?

02:08.890 --> 02:10.323
'Cause I want to talk.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.679
You did talk.

02:11.730 --> 02:14.858
(laughs)
Can everyone just give me
a break?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.465
Look, I made a mistake.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.559
Things have been a bit
out of control lately,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.636
but I want to make it up, okay?

02:23.670 --> 02:25.604
Coral Bar.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.177
But you'd better hurry up,
because I'm not waiting.

02:28.210 --> 02:30.542
Good. I'll see you in ten.
(phone beeps off)

02:30.580 --> 02:32.343
Don't you dare
turn around!
Drop the keys!

02:32.380 --> 02:33.608
Look straight ahead!
...to the ground!

02:33.650 --> 02:35.868
You move one inch...
(overlapping shouting)

02:35.920 --> 02:38.912
...or I will put one
in the back of your head!

02:38.950 --> 02:40.656
Get your hands
behind your back!
Move! Move!

02:40.690 --> 02:42.783
Get your arm...
Don't you resist me!
Don't you move!

02:42.830 --> 02:44.457
I'll break your arm!

02:44.490 --> 02:45.752
What do you have in your pocket?

02:45.790 --> 02:47.724
Anything that's gonna stick me?
Anything sharp?

02:47.760 --> 02:48.897
No.
Are you sure?

02:48.930 --> 02:49.919
Yes.
Lose the attitude.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.665
Just a wallet.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.899
What did I do?

02:55.940 --> 02:57.532
Shut the hell up.
Let's go.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.545
(phone buzzing)

03:07.550 --> 03:08.744
Yeah?

03:08.780 --> 03:10.486
WOMAN:
Hey! Where are you?

03:10.520 --> 03:11.714
Uh, who is this?

03:11.750 --> 03:13.479
(rock music playing)

03:13.520 --> 03:15.351
Damn, Kalinda, I'm offended.

03:15.390 --> 03:16.721
You really don't know
who this is?

03:18.630 --> 03:19.551
Sophia.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.897
Yeah, don't sound so surprised.

03:20.930 --> 03:21.919
Where are you?

03:21.960 --> 03:24.360
Me? Where are you?

03:24.400 --> 03:26.391
I am finishing up a case.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.533
I feel like celebrating.

03:28.570 --> 03:29.537
Keep me company?

03:29.570 --> 03:30.559
No, thank you.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.635
Kalinda.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.908
I'm meeting somebody.
VVho?

03:33.940 --> 03:35.532
Somebody.

03:35.580 --> 03:36.877
A guy.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.468
Okay.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.579
I can take you both on.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.609
Where are you?

03:40.650 --> 03:41.674
Good night, Sophia.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.642
Come on!
I'm lonely.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.941
And horny.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.458
Yeah. Good luck with that.

03:53.630 --> 03:55.894
(phone chiming)

04:00.600 --> 04:02.329
I was supposed to meet someone,
can I just...

04:02.370 --> 04:04.531
can I just tell them
I'll be late?

04:04.570 --> 04:05.969
Oh, sure. I'll pull
right over.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.534
Yeah, you want
some ice cream?

04:07.580 --> 04:08.638
(both chuckling)

04:18.390 --> 04:20.915
Still want to meet up?

04:22.560 --> 04:25.324
(snoring softly)

04:25.360 --> 04:26.725
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:26.760 --> 04:30.469
(snoring)

04:36.710 --> 04:38.735
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.978
Hello?

04:44.010 --> 04:45.807
Detective?

04:45.850 --> 04:48.671
_I haven't been
given my call, yet.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.914
I know my rights.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.588
I've_ been here
SIX hours,

04:51.620 --> 04:53.759
and I haven't
gotten my call.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.487
Thank you.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.699
Seriously?

05:03.770 --> 05:05.965
Look, I have a Sixth
Amendment right

05:06.000 --> 05:08.366
to be informed of
the charges against me.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.334
I have the right
to an attorney.

05:10.370 --> 05:12.907
You know who has the hardest
time getting arrested?

05:12.940 --> 05:14.373
Lawyers.

05:14.410 --> 05:15.604
You know why?

05:15.640 --> 05:17.346
Because we know
our rights.
No.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.972
You think you're
at the Four Seasons.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.649
You asked for your Sixth
Amendment rights, it'll come,

05:21.680 --> 05:23.511
just not right away.
The kitchen's a little busy.

05:23.550 --> 05:24.642
Might take a little while.

05:24.690 --> 05:26.681
In the meantime, be patient.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.689
We'll get to you.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.721
This is harassment.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.692
No, it's worse.

05:32.730 --> 05:35.699
It's inefficiency.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.861
Should we do this
another time?

05:44.910 --> 05:46.707
No, let's start.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.071
I'll fi|| Cary in
when he gets here.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.870
I have 45 clients I intend
to bring to Florrick-Agos.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.569
I lose 12 to
Lockhart/Gardner.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.713
Won't Canning and David Lee
come after the rest?

05:57.750 --> 05:58.682
Not if I don't tell
them I'm leaving.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.087
That sounds familiar.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.725
But I have demands first.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.784
Kalinda.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.092
She needs to
come With me.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.119
We have Robyn.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.127
Kalinda's better.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.468
It's a deal-breaker.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.728
I have to talk to Cary.

06:11.770 --> 06:14.830
They have a certain...

06:14.870 --> 06:16.838
relationship that
might prove difficult.

06:16.870 --> 06:18.838
If the answer is "no,"
then I need to know right away.

06:18.870 --> 06:19.939
I'll let you know by the end
of the day.

06:19.980 --> 06:20.935
Good.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.845
Here's the big one.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.871
I expect an equal vote
with Cary and you.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.810
You can still
out-vote me two-to-one,

06:26.850 --> 06:29.785
but I bring with
me prestige.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.845
And 38 million.

06:31.890 --> 06:33.585
I expect an equal vote.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.759
I can't decide that on my own.
It'll matter to Cary.

06:35.790 --> 06:36.927
Like this meeting mattered
to him?

06:39.560 --> 06:41.425
Alicia,

06:41.460 --> 06:43.621
we have a chance to make this
the largest fIrm

06:43.670 --> 06:45.797
in the country run by women.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.138
Think about it.

06:51.670 --> 06:56.642
(phone chiming)

06:58.550 --> 07:00.871
Cary, look, if you're not
interested in our future,

07:00.920 --> 07:02.581
just let me know, okay?

07:02.620 --> 07:04.747
And I'll start making decisions
on my own.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.189
Call me by 3:00,

07:06.220 --> 07:09.951
or I am gathering the partners
together for a vote.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.057
I was awake.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.567
Okay?

07:16.600 --> 07:17.897
You were asleep,

07:17.930 --> 07:21.798
and I heard what
the charge was against you.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.864
You did?

07:22.910 --> 07:23.763
What?

07:23.810 --> 07:26.199
Drugs.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.903
Okay, on your feet.
Let's go.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.441
Let's see here.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.888
Did you guys get
any breakfast?

07:55.540 --> 07:57.929
What the hell
did he just say?
What?

07:57.970 --> 08:01.133
(yelling):
What the hell did he just
say about where to walk?

08:01.180 --> 08:02.977
I have no idea...
(garbled mimicking)

08:03.010 --> 08:04.841
You stay to the
right, jackass!

08:04.880 --> 08:06.814
That side is
for the people,

08:06.850 --> 08:09.148
this side is for the scum.
Do you understand me?

08:13.860 --> 08:16.579
(quietly):
Just do what I do.

08:24.930 --> 08:26.227
Let me see your hands.

08:27.870 --> 08:29.292
It's kind of dark in there.
Inside.

08:29.340 --> 08:31.535
Hands.

08:32.810 --> 08:34.232
Walk.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.908
(indistinct chatter)

08:39.880 --> 08:42.246
(low chatter)

08:51.290 --> 08:53.758
Where's Cary?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.051
Breakfast with
you,Ithought

08:55.100 --> 08:56.761
He didn't make it.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.062
I'll try him
at home.

09:11.280 --> 09:15.819
*

09:28.900 --> 09:30.993
Hey.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.735
I know you.
I didn't do anything.

09:34.770 --> 09:36.965
This is my space.
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.864
You're a Lockhart/Gardner
client now.

09:38.910 --> 09:41.003
What? No. What?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.770
Look, do you want to make $100?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.313
$150 cash bond,
payable on release.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.147
(bangs gavel)
Let's go, let's boogie.

09:49.180 --> 09:50.989
I hate this.
Why am I doing this?

09:51.020 --> 09:52.658
Look, he's the son
of a top client.

09:52.690 --> 09:53.884
Canning couldn't make it.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.319
Here he comes.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.850
David Howell.

09:56.890 --> 09:58.221
Mail fraud,
third offense.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.023
Dear God. I can understand
the second time.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.995
But the third time,
you'd think he'd catch on.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.167
David!

10:04.200 --> 10:05.758
How are you?
I'm David Lee,

10:05.800 --> 10:07.995
I represent your family
law business, but...

10:08.040 --> 10:11.032
I'm supposed to give you
a message.
I've been asked to
handle your bond hearing.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.231
There-there's a lawyer in
lockup that
It really should
be a simple matter.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.134
wants me to give you a message.
Look, only one of us
can talk at a time, David!

10:15.180 --> 10:17.978
What lavwer?
Um.

10:18.010 --> 10:19.910
Well, wait.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.019
Uh, it starts with a "C."

10:21.050 --> 10:22.984
Uh, Craig?

10:23.020 --> 10:25.181
Lanz.
Lanz.

10:25.220 --> 10:26.209
Uh, no.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.251
No. Vargas.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.929
Uh, no.
It's something.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.952
Uh, he's a lawyer,
and he's in lockup.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.922
But he-- but he works
for another firm.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.861
Cary.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.060
Agos?

10:39.100 --> 10:40.397
Is that the name of the lawyer?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.103
No, Lanz.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.768
Cary Lanz.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.801
Is Cary there, Alicia?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.273
No, he's not. Why?

10:49.310 --> 10:51.107
Is there any chance
he was arrested?

10:52.250 --> 10:54.810
(phone rings)

10:54.850 --> 10:56.943
ASA Polmar?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.218
Finn, it's Alicia.
I need your help.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.081
Why? What's wrong?

11:00.120 --> 11:02.953
There's a chance my partner is
in central holding.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.787
(gavelbangs)
All right, let's go.
Who's next?

11:04.830 --> 11:05.956
Thanks for doing
this, Finn.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.355
Alicia,
no problem.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.254
But, ah, I don't think you're
gonna want to thank me.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.324
Why?

11:10.370 --> 11:13.032
I just found out I'm the ASA.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.037
On Cary's case?

11:14.070 --> 11:15.731
Yeah.

11:15.770 --> 11:16.805
Across from me?

11:16.840 --> 11:17.966
Yeah.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.978
Well, this should prove
interesting.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.739
Yeah.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.304
Oh, thank God.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.339
How did you know?

11:24.380 --> 11:27.019
Kalinda.
Good. Okay.

11:27.050 --> 11:28.017
It's a drug arrest.

11:28.050 --> 11:29.142
That's all I know.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.818
But the last time
I used drugs

11:30.850 --> 11:32.044
was the mushrooms
four years ago.

11:32.090 --> 11:33.114
Do you have enough for bail?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.889
I pooled the partners.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.854
I have $500 cash.
First offense, no flight risk.

11:36.890 --> 11:37.982
It shouldn't be a problem.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.998
MAN:
Cary Agos.

11:40.030 --> 11:42.328
No matter what,
I talk.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.863
JUDGE:
Well, I see we're enjoying a
visit from a special ASA.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.458
Is this some sort of
a "VIP" engagement?

11:46.500 --> 11:50.004
This is not just another
routine arrest, Your Honor.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.065
Mr. Cary Agos is accused
of a Super X felony.

11:52.110 --> 11:52.906
And is...
What?

11:52.940 --> 11:54.430
It is
a non-probationable offense

11:54.480 --> 11:57.108
with a minimum sentence
of 15 years.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.106
My goodness.
Smack or crack?

11:59.150 --> 12:00.310
Heroin, your honor.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.511
How many grams?

12:02.550 --> 12:04.814
900 grams.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.249
Are-- (laughs)
You're kidding.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.917
And we ask that
court assign bail

12:07.960 --> 12:09.382
in excess of $1.3 million.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.133
POLMAR: ...assign bail in excess
of $1.3 million dollars.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.772
JUDGE:
I imagine you'd like bail set

12:29.810 --> 12:31.243
at an amount lower
than the ASA requested.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.078
Yes, Your Honor.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.270
Clearly, the State's Attorney
is overreaching.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.242
How I wish I were,
Your Honor,

12:38.290 --> 12:40.258
but, in Illinois, bail is tied

12:40.290 --> 12:42.212
with the street value of the
controlled substance.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.228
Now, on or about
May 25 of this year,

12:44.260 --> 12:46.922
Mr. Cary Agos conspired
to transport

12:46.960 --> 12:48.791
and sell $1.3 million in...

12:48.830 --> 12:52.391
Your Honor,
Mr. Agos has a clean record.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.364
He has major ties
in the community,

12:54.400 --> 12:57.506
and he is as far from a flight
risk as it's possible to be.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.428
(knocking)

12:59.470 --> 13:02.030
And he was an ASA.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.275
Therefore, he's subject
to retribution in jail.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.175
And yet his
incentive to flee

13:06.210 --> 13:07.916
is directly tied
to the harshness

13:07.950 --> 13:09.178
of the sentencing guidelines.

13:09.220 --> 13:11.984
I, therefore, will match bail
to street value.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.351
(gavel slams)

13:13.390 --> 13:15.358
Your Honor, I will be filing
a motion to reconsider.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.028
When you file, I
will do just that.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.221
Bail is set at $1.3 million,

13:19.260 --> 13:21.558
to be posted at a
hundred percent.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.329
We will r_econvene_
for a preliminary hearing

13:23.370 --> 13:25.224
in two weeks' time.
(gavel slams)

13:26.330 --> 13:27.558
I'll gather the
partners for bail.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.033
This has to be
about Bishop.

13:29.070 --> 13:31.368
Were you with him on May 25?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.469
I never heard about
any drug transport.

13:33.510 --> 13:36.229
They're going after your
legal advice, trying to suggest

13:36.280 --> 13:37.941
that you told him
how to break the law.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.039
You need to get to Bishop
before he hears about my arrest.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.172
He might think I'll flip.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.244
I'm on it!

13:42.280 --> 13:44.214
(tires squealing)

13:44.250 --> 13:45.581
I'm on my way to see you now,
Mr. Bishop.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.281
If you could just give me
ten minutes.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.287
Regarding?

13:48.320 --> 13:49.924
I'd rather not say on the phone.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.019
You know it's important,
if I'm calling you like this.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.220
I'm picking up Dylan
from school.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.251
I-I'll meet you there!

13:55.300 --> 13:56.358
See you in ten minutes.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.595
(line ringing)

13:58.630 --> 14:00.495
ROBYN: Hello, Florrick-Agos.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.394
Robyn, I need you to get the
partners together.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.634
I'll be in in an hour.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.558
Okay, is this about
the Diane vote?

14:05.610 --> 14:07.339
(groans)
No.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.302
And could you find out how much
the firm can borrow?

14:09.340 --> 14:10.568
What do you mean?
Like, for maintenance?

14:10.610 --> 14:12.441
We have a $600,000
line of credit.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.368
No, Cary was arrested
last night.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.445
It's for his bail.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.640
Oh, my God.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.282
How much is bail?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.584
I need you to keep this
between us, Robyn...

14:21.620 --> 14:23.326
We need to raise $1.3 million.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.884
(phone beeps)

14:24.930 --> 14:25.954
That's my call-waiting.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.049
$1.3 mill...

14:28.100 --> 14:29.590
Yes, and there are no
bail bondsmen in Illinois,

14:29.630 --> 14:31.666
so, we have to do this
on our own. I've got to go.

14:31.700 --> 14:32.667
This is Alicia.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.292
ELI: Okay, I've slept on it,

14:34.340 --> 14:36.228
and I'd like your permission to
poll on your campaign.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.305
Eli.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.137
No, there is no campaign.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.331
I know.
That's why we have to poll.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.008
Eli, this is not the best time.
I have to go and meet...

14:44.050 --> 14:45.506
Look, you're not obligated
to act on...

14:45.550 --> 14:47.415
Eli, I'm hanging up. No polling.
(phone beeps)

14:47.450 --> 14:48.439
It won't cost you anyth...

14:48.480 --> 14:49.981
I liked your
old office better.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.181
This is more like
a dentist office.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.209
We're saving money.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.352
I thought Chicago was corrupt.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.381
Can't you just steal more?

14:56.420 --> 14:58.126
Don't you have something else
to do today?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.151
I told you
I was fired.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.224
From the agency?

15:01.260 --> 15:04.127
The Juice Bar.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.523
What are you doing now?

15:05.570 --> 15:06.628
I'm looking out the door.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.092
Why?

15:08.140 --> 15:09.937
I'm surveying the troops.

15:09.970 --> 15:12.632
Is it about the intern
not wearing panties?

15:12.670 --> 15:14.399
What?

15:14.440 --> 15:16.101
The intern not wearing panties.

15:16.140 --> 15:17.448
Is that why you're worried?

15:17.480 --> 15:19.004
Which_ intern is not
wearing panties?

15:19.050 --> 15:20.472
Her.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.272
Bertha? She's a grandmother.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.380
No, behind her.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.718
Oh, dear God. How do you know
she's not wearing any panties?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.159
I heard
the guys talking.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.158
Uh-oh.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.325
Maybe he's telling her
she has to put on panties.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.725
"Really? I have to wear panties

15:36.760 --> 15:38.660
in the governor's
office? Are you sure?"

15:38.700 --> 15:40.964
"For decorum's sake, yes.
If it were up to me,

15:41.000 --> 15:42.262
you could wear
what you wanted."

15:42.300 --> 15:43.301
"Ha, ha, ha, ha."

15:45.470 --> 15:47.574
Don't say anything. This is not
the time to be funny.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.475
Eli, I need to talk to you.

15:49.510 --> 15:50.602
He|_|o.
Hi.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.208
This is my daughter, Marissa.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.218
Marissa, what a pleasure.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.342
_ Peter.
Nice to meet you.

15:55.380 --> 15:56.415
I voted for you.

15:56.450 --> 15:58.486
Absentee ballot in Israel.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.215
She spent two years
with the IDF.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.386
That's impressive.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.557
I'm gonna steal your dad

16:02.590 --> 16:03.727
for just a second.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.649
Um...

16:06.690 --> 16:08.521
You asked Alicia to run?

16:08.560 --> 16:09.754
What?
My wife, Alicia Florrick.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.358
You asked her to run
for State's Attorney.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.539
Jackie overheard you.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.435
Okay, Peter.
Here's the thing.

16:17.570 --> 16:19.367
She's my wife.
Yeah.

16:19.410 --> 16:20.536
And she can win.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.729
It's not your job to be doing...

16:21.780 --> 16:23.304
It i my job, Peter.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.079
Why do you think
I'm fighting so hard

16:25.110 --> 16:26.577
to get a friendly face in the
State's Attorney's office?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.475
Because you have problems there.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.248
Because someone could...

16:29.280 --> 16:31.316
dig up old skeletons.
All right.

16:31.350 --> 16:32.385
Find another "friendly face."

16:32.420 --> 16:33.557
It's not going to be my wife.

16:33.590 --> 16:34.579
End of story.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.291
(school bell ringing)

16:40.330 --> 16:41.399
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Bishop.

16:41.430 --> 16:42.556
I'll make this fast.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.091
Cary Agos was arrested.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.427
Who's he?

16:46.470 --> 16:49.394
My partner,
your other lavwer.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.408
Oh, the kid. Right.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.305
We wanted you to hear it
from us first.

16:53.340 --> 16:56.707
They're saying that he helped
transport $1.3 million in heroin

16:56.740 --> 16:58.401
on May 25.

17:01.450 --> 17:04.283
We want you to know
that we are handling this.

17:05.850 --> 17:06.817
What's that mean?

17:06.850 --> 17:08.181
We're putting together his bail,

17:08.220 --> 17:09.778
and I'm representing him.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.720
What's his bail?

17:11.760 --> 17:14.695
$1.3 million.

17:14.730 --> 17:17.494
Again, I want you to know

17:17.530 --> 17:19.498
that attorney-client
privilege covers

17:19.530 --> 17:21.191
all his dealings with you.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.639
Not illegal dealings.

17:22.670 --> 17:25.366
It's my considered opinion

17:25.410 --> 17:27.628
there were no illegal dealings.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.501
Also, Cary would never make a
deal with the State's Attorney.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.213
Even

17:34.250 --> 17:37.549
They're using him
to get to me.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.841
That's why the
bail amount.

17:38.890 --> 17:39.845
Yes.

17:39.890 --> 17:41.517
And we're handling this.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.427
Cary will not turn on you,
Mr. Bishop.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.280
Believe me.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.218
Okay.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.669
Keep me posted.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.837
Dylan!

17:53.870 --> 17:55.838
Over here!

17:55.870 --> 17:58.100
If anyone has any drugs,

17:58.140 --> 18:00.574
or anything, in any orifice,

18:00.610 --> 18:02.805
now's the time to tell me.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.640
Shoes held by the toes,
pull out your insoles. Now!

18:08.520 --> 18:11.842
Let's go,
let's go!

18:11.890 --> 18:15.155
Now, bang those
shoes together.

18:15.190 --> 18:16.350
Drop your shoes,

18:16.390 --> 18:17.652
hold your arms out.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.829
Put your palms
facing the ceiling.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.398
Do not--

18:24.430 --> 18:26.625
I repeat,
do not smudge this,

18:26.670 --> 18:29.389
or you will have
my full attention.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.533
Cary Agos.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.674
Let's go.

18:33.710 --> 18:36.634
This is your new home.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.545
This is where you will live.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.468
(buzzer sounds)

18:40.520 --> 18:42.147
I am your landlord.

18:42.180 --> 18:43.841
Don't make me angry.

18:46.820 --> 18:49.618
Number five.

18:49.660 --> 18:52.379
Hey. Five minutes.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.303
You stood me up.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.511
(laughs)

19:14.550 --> 19:16.518
Yes.

19:16.550 --> 19:18.939
Between having a drink with you
or spending a night in jail.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.651
(chuckles)

19:23.760 --> 19:25.819
So, the charge said,
"On or about May 25"?

19:25.860 --> 19:28.294
What happened on May 25?
You working this?

19:28.330 --> 19:29.695
You want me working this?

19:31.730 --> 19:32.924
Thank you.

19:32.970 --> 19:35.268
We don't have time to gush.
Okay?

19:35.300 --> 19:36.494
What happened?

19:36.540 --> 19:38.667
We were worried
about losmg clients...

19:38.710 --> 19:40.735
Cary, lean in.

19:42.310 --> 19:43.675
We were worried
about losmg clients,

19:43.710 --> 19:45.348
so I met with Bishop
to see if he was happy.

19:45.380 --> 19:46.347
That was on May 25.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.540
Bishop alone?

19:47.580 --> 19:49.571
No. In his kitchen,

19:49.620 --> 19:52.384
while I was waiting before,
there were three crew members.

19:52.420 --> 19:53.455
You remember any of their names?

19:53.490 --> 19:54.650
No, I don't-I don't think
they said their names.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.352
They just...

19:57.390 --> 20:00.655
One had silver teeth.
Top row.
Okay.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.951
What did you tell them?

20:02.000 --> 20:02.989
Nothing illegal.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.497
You know
the charge says that

20:04.530 --> 20:05.997
you told them
how to elude arrest

20:06.030 --> 20:08.339
in the next drug shipment.
I didn't.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.792
Okay, but is there any way that

20:09.840 --> 20:11.535
whatever you said
could have been misconstrued?

20:11.570 --> 20:12.639
Not reasonably.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.678
Show me your arm.

20:18.710 --> 20:20.746
"C-block. 8-6-9..."

20:20.780 --> 20:22.441
DETECTIVE:
That's five.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.308
Any advice?

20:25.350 --> 20:26.339
Yeah.

20:26.390 --> 20:27.812
Find a friend.

20:30.790 --> 20:31.927
Thank you.

20:33.730 --> 20:35.527
You're kidding, right?

20:35.560 --> 20:36.652
You're retiring?

20:36.700 --> 20:38.565
Yes, at the end
of the month.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.763
I want to keep the General
Managership until then.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.633
After that, you can have it.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.262
Diane...

20:46.310 --> 20:47.504
is retiring.

20:47.540 --> 20:48.973
What? Why?

20:49.010 --> 20:50.705
(scoffs)
You're kidding.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.001
You're forcing me out.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.415
I'm sick of fighting.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.338
Yes, but not so you'd retire.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.415
Where are you going?

20:56.450 --> 20:59.544
Nowhere.
She's retiring.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.917
Oh. Well,

21:01.960 --> 21:03.279
I'm sorry to hear it.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.286
Well, it's time.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.594
I want to have a life
with my new husband.

21:07.630 --> 21:09.928
You will put in a good word
for us with your clients.

21:09.960 --> 21:13.293
Yes, as long as you don't
chase them till I'm retired.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.069
I want this to be
a dignified exit.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.500
Oh, uh... Absolutely.

21:24.510 --> 21:25.704
(door closes)

21:25.750 --> 21:27.445
You believe her?

21:27.480 --> 21:29.778
That she's retiring?

21:29.820 --> 21:31.811
I don't know.

21:31.850 --> 21:34.683
Where would she go?

21:34.720 --> 21:37.826
I thought Diane was retiring.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.851
She is retiring--
from Lockhart/Gardner,

21:39.890 --> 21:40.891
and coming here to us.

21:42.860 --> 21:44.794
Wh-Why didn't she tell us?
She's our lawyer.

21:44.830 --> 21:46.969
Yes, and due to her

21:47.000 --> 21:48.934
fiduciary responsibility
to Lockhart/Gardner,

21:48.970 --> 21:50.801
she can't tell you a thing...

21:52.910 --> 21:54.104
...including the fact that

21:54.140 --> 21:56.802
she wants you
to follow her here,

21:56.840 --> 21:59.707
to her new home.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.878
Would you excuse me a second?

22:02.920 --> 22:05.081
(indistinct, loud conversations)

22:07.090 --> 22:08.887
ROBYN:
We can't let Cary
rot in prison.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.559
Well, what about his family?
I thought his parents were rich.

22:11.590 --> 22:13.399
I called them. They're seeing
what they can pull together.

22:13.430 --> 22:14.749
I mean, it's
$1.3 million.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.427
That's a lot
of money...
Robyn...

22:16.460 --> 22:18.394
I checked with the bank,
and it'll require borrowing

22:18.430 --> 22:19.795
$200,000 against the firm,

22:19.830 --> 22:21.832
and each partner needs to put
aside their yearly draw.

22:21.870 --> 22:23.132
Okay, that's...
Oh...

22:23.170 --> 22:24.831
(talking over each other)
ALICIA:
Hey, QUYS,

22:24.870 --> 22:26.428
this is what we do.
When one of us gets

22:26.470 --> 22:28.074
in trouble, we...
we pull together.

22:28.110 --> 22:29.873
Yeah.
And Cary's not a flight risk.

22:29.910 --> 22:31.639
The money, it comes back to us.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.875
Yes, in two years, after
the case has been settled.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.569
And in the meantime,
we go bankrupt.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.588
And I need that draw
to pay my rent.

22:37.620 --> 22:38.780
I mean, I'm sorry,
but...
I think you're
being selfish.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.412
(talking over each other)

22:40.460 --> 22:42.610
Okay. Hey.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.651
Let's vote. _ _
(buzzer sound, indistinct
announcement over P.A.)

22:44.690 --> 22:47.818
(low chatter)

22:50.160 --> 22:52.958
(indistinct guard announcement)

22:56.000 --> 22:58.537
MAN:
Are you a lawyer?

23:06.010 --> 23:07.716
Yeah.

23:07.750 --> 23:08.910
Do you need one?

23:08.950 --> 23:10.838
Depends on how much you charge.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.084
(laughs)

23:12.120 --> 23:14.452
I'm pretty
reasonable.

23:14.490 --> 23:15.980
What do
you need?

23:16.020 --> 23:18.727
Yeah, I was there.

23:18.760 --> 23:19.954
KALIN DA:
You were with
Cary Agos?

23:19.990 --> 23:21.025
Bishop's lawyer?

23:21.060 --> 23:22.459
Yeah.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.865
This was on the
25th of May?

23:23.900 --> 23:24.992
Around then.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.759
That's when I was
at Bishop's house.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.199
And this lawyer, he
didn't tell you anything

23:28.240 --> 23:29.764
about how to
break the law.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.734
Is that
correct?
Yeah. Pretty much.

23:31.770 --> 23:32.737
Will you testify to that?

23:32.770 --> 23:34.078
It's for Bishop, right?

23:34.110 --> 23:35.099
Yeah.

23:35.140 --> 23:36.573
Oh, uh,

23:36.610 --> 23:38.077
could you
make a list

23:38.110 --> 23:39.907
of the people
that were there?
In Bishop's kitchen?

23:39.950 --> 23:41.178
Mm-hmm.
Sure.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.642
Excuse me.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.488
Kalinda.

23:49.820 --> 23:50.855
You can't do that.

23:50.890 --> 23:52.653
Do what, sir?

23:52.690 --> 23:54.555
Talk to my guys.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.750
Not without my permission.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.018
May I have your
permission?
No.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.031
This is to help Cary Agos.

24:03.070 --> 24:05.630
I understand
that.

24:05.670 --> 24:06.864
No.

24:06.910 --> 24:08.878
If it helps Cary,
it helps you.

24:09.910 --> 24:12.606
Because Cary threatens me.

24:15.050 --> 24:16.642
No.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.887
Because Cary had
a private meeting

24:18.920 --> 24:20.114
with three members
of your crew,

24:20.150 --> 24:21.754
and suddenly
he's under arrest.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.554
Someone is collaborating
with the police.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.923
If that's true...

24:28.960 --> 24:31.690
I'll handle it.

24:31.730 --> 24:33.664
I'm going to say this
very carefully,

24:33.700 --> 24:35.588
so you understand.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.699
I don't want you to pursue

24:37.740 --> 24:39.662
this line of investigation.

24:39.710 --> 24:41.905
Do you
understand?

24:43.210 --> 24:44.609
Yeah.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.641
Good.

24:49.050 --> 24:52.087
Good talking to you.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.757
BONITA:
These represent
our most recent numbers

25:00.800 --> 25:02.153
on the state's attorney race.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.566
We focused on
the top three candidates.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.535
In a hypothetical race between
the current state's attorney,

25:09.870 --> 25:11.701
Mrs. Florrick would
win by eight points.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.706
Margin of error?

25:15.740 --> 25:17.742
Three points.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.748
How many people were sampled?

25:19.780 --> 25:21.213
Oh, just ignore her.
It's my daughter.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.171
Just ignore me.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.211
4,000 likely voters.
LandHnes

25:24.250 --> 25:26.013
and cell phones.

25:26.050 --> 25:28.018
Mrs. Florrick
is well-liked among

25:28.060 --> 25:29.914
female voters, liberal
and conservative.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.689
That's very
unusuaL

25:31.730 --> 25:34.028
Older female voters liked that
she stood by her husband;

25:34.060 --> 25:36.221
younger, that she started
her own business.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.966
LAUREN:
You needed me, Mr. Gold?

25:39.070 --> 25:40.298
Actually, Nora

25:40.330 --> 25:41.558
needed to talk
to you.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.136
No, I don't.

25:43.170 --> 25:44.637
Yes, you do.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.661
You-you said you needed
to ask Lauren a question.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.736
Could you give
us a second?

25:52.080 --> 25:54.275
I can't ask her.
It's sexual harassment.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.969
But asking me to ask her
isn't sexual harassment?

25:56.020 --> 25:58.181
Oh, dear God.
ELI:
Come on, Nora.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.017
You can bring up panties
in a much more efficient

26:00.050 --> 26:01.950
and less offensive
way than I can.
Oh, really?

26:01.990 --> 26:03.981
Why do you want to know what
she's got going on under there?

26:04.030 --> 26:05.054
Are you wearing panties?

26:05.090 --> 26:06.182
LAUREN:
What?

26:06.230 --> 26:07.254
MARISSA: _
Are you wearing panties?

26:07.290 --> 26:08.359
Some of the office workers

26:08.400 --> 26:09.697
are saying you're not wearing

26:09.730 --> 26:12.563
panties.

26:14.270 --> 26:16.261
LAUREN:
Does that answer your question?

26:17.670 --> 26:19.308
Bonita, I need you
to do another poll--

26:19.340 --> 26:21.308
this one about the governor.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.979
Personal or
professmnal?

26:24.010 --> 26:25.978
Personal.

26:26.010 --> 26:29.218
Your son could stay
in prison for a year, sir.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.844
A full year, awaiting trial...

26:33.720 --> 26:35.688
Okay.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.914
Yes.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.257
Thank you.

26:39.330 --> 26:42.026
He can go as high as $8,000.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.721
You're kidding. I thought
his dad was a lobbyist.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.192
He said it's a bad time of year.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.266
Okay.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.767
We have 100 from the firm.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.199
Eight from the family.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.832
Cary has 200 saved.

26:51.870 --> 26:54.031
We're $975,000 away.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.900
We're a million away.
No.

26:55.940 --> 26:58.306
I have $15,000 in savings, and
my parents loaned me $10,000.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.749
Robyn...

26:59.780 --> 27:01.816
you can't.
Well, of
course I can.

27:01.850 --> 27:03.886
Cary would do the same for me.

27:05.690 --> 27:06.918
We're still

27:06.950 --> 27:08.349
$975,000 short.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.157
Who are you
calling, Bishop?

27:16.200 --> 27:17.667
No.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.429
Hi, Moira.
It's Alicia.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.028
I was wondering if
you had any time today.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.435
I wanted to talk
about my condo.

27:22.470 --> 27:24.665
Possibly taking out
a second mortgage.

27:25.470 --> 27:26.960
Hey, it's only money.

27:27.010 --> 27:28.432
CAREY:
Alicia? Judge Karpman's

27:28.480 --> 27:30.675
office is calling.
You're needed in court.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.302
That's bond court.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.318
The judge is hearing my motion
to reconsider on bail.

27:34.350 --> 27:35.669
Moira?

27:35.720 --> 27:37.039
I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

27:37.080 --> 27:38.286
Thanks.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.981
Here we go again.

27:40.020 --> 27:41.954
Maybe you can raise the bail
to $3 million this time.

27:41.990 --> 27:43.184
Why didn't I
think of that?

27:43.220 --> 27:44.357
JUDGE:
Ah, counselors.

27:44.390 --> 27:46.449
I understand that
you Wish to reVIew

27:46.490 --> 27:48.299
the Cary Agos
situation.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.150
Is that right,
ASA Polmar?

27:51.270 --> 27:53.192
Uh, actually,
Your Honor,

27:53.230 --> 27:56.199
I made a motion to reduce
the bail amount...
JUDGE: Yes.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.458
And your motion was denied.
Mr. Polmar?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.364
Yes, Your Honor.

28:00.410 --> 28:02.708
Mrs. Florrick works as
Cary Agos's partner,

28:02.740 --> 28:04.742
but she also represents
Lemond Bishop,

28:04.780 --> 28:07.374
a drug dealer complicit
in this matter.

28:07.410 --> 28:11.085
JUDGE:
So you wish to disqualify
her as his representative?

28:11.120 --> 28:13.145
Yes, Your Honor.

28:13.190 --> 28:14.817
Your Honor,
Cary Agos

28:14.860 --> 28:16.452
chose me as
his lawyer

28:16.490 --> 28:18.253
and has waived
all concerns

28:18.290 --> 28:19.757
about conflict
of interests...

28:19.790 --> 28:21.326
Yes, but the court has not.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.419
The prosecution's
motion is granted.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.428
(gavelbangs)

28:25.470 --> 28:28.098
Wow, I didn't
see that coming.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.368
Well, you should
be honored.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.402
I didn't want to go
up against you.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.830
Is this about your sister?

28:36.510 --> 28:38.375
Is what about
my Sister?
This drug case.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.401
Is it about your
sister's overdose?

28:40.450 --> 28:42.077
Yeah, 'cause that's
whatI need is a motive

28:42.120 --> 28:43.781
to bring down the top
drug dealer in town.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.811
Cary Agos isn't the top
drug dealer in town.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.250
No, but he's enabled the
top drug dealer in town.

28:48.290 --> 28:49.757
As have I.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.357
Is this gonna get in the way
of a friendship, Alicia?

28:54.530 --> 28:56.327
I hope not.
Good.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.918
I don't
want it to.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.369
Neither do I.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.890
My apologies.

29:06.970 --> 29:08.278
Okay.

29:10.510 --> 29:12.273
ALICIA:
I need you to represent Cary.

29:12.310 --> 29:14.073
He was
arrested.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.213
One of Bishop's
crew is claiming

29:16.250 --> 29:18.286
that he told them
how to avoid detection

29:18.320 --> 29:20.413
on a drug
shipment.

29:20.450 --> 29:22.452
How large was
the shipment?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.382
$1.3 million
in heroin.

29:27.530 --> 29:29.054
That's not good.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.489
Uh... wait,
it's not good for Cary,

29:31.530 --> 29:33.361
or it's not good for us?
Both.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.197
My clients won't like to see

29:35.240 --> 29:37.094
my new name partner
under arrest.
He was
arrested

29:37.140 --> 29:39.404
because he was fighting
for his client.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.533
He puts his life
on the line for them.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.817
Okay.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.442
CANNING:
She's going with Florrick-Agos.

29:53.490 --> 29:56.209
No, too small
potatoes.

29:56.260 --> 29:58.455
Ah, it fits Diane's
romantic soul.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.289
Then there's
an opportunity.

30:07.330 --> 30:08.968
What would that be?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.798
Cary Agos was arrested
a few days ago.

30:12.940 --> 30:14.578
A drug charge.

30:16.010 --> 30:17.409
Oh.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.839
I, uh,
I need your help, Kalinda.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.472
Cary's been arrested.

30:20.510 --> 30:23.115
KALIN DA:
I know.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.344
Oh.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.585
It has to do with Bishop.

30:26.620 --> 30:27.951
You knew that, too.

30:27.990 --> 30:29.184
KALINDA:
I did.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.448
Okay, so you need to talk

30:30.490 --> 30:32.082
to the other people
in Bishop's crew,

30:32.130 --> 30:33.324
find out who was in
this meeting with Cary?

30:33.360 --> 30:34.588
Look, Bishop doesn't want us

30:34.630 --> 30:35.949
to talk to any of his crew.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.627
He wants us to defend Cary
in another way.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.321
Look, I have an idea,

30:39.370 --> 30:41.258
but I'll get back to you
when I have more, okay?

30:41.300 --> 30:42.528
Hey!

30:43.970 --> 30:45.369
Kalinda.

30:45.410 --> 30:46.866
Hey.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.931
(men whooping, laughing)
What?

30:49.980 --> 30:51.607
Oh, come on, I'm just
giving the boys

30:51.650 --> 30:53.106
something to
fantasize about.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.617
What's up?
What do you need me for?

30:54.650 --> 30:56.345
Why did you call me
Thursday night?

30:56.380 --> 30:57.608
Why did I call you?

30:57.650 --> 30:58.947
I think I made that
pretty clear.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.116
_The first time
in three years,

31:00.150 --> 31:01.253
you just decide
to call me?

31:01.290 --> 31:02.951
Yeah.
At the exact
moment

31:02.990 --> 31:05.049
Cary Agos was being arrested?

31:06.390 --> 31:08.199
You're working with the police.

31:08.230 --> 31:09.925
You knew about the arrest,

31:09.960 --> 31:11.518
and you knew
I'd get picked up, too,

31:11.570 --> 31:13.162
so you kept me occupied.

31:15.070 --> 31:17.664
Look, I didn't want you to get
swept up in all that crap.

31:17.700 --> 31:21.033
What evidence have they
got against Cary?
What evidence? Why?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.672
Is there someone undercover
in Bishop's crew?

31:22.710 --> 31:24.507
And what makes
you think

31:24.550 --> 31:27.144
even ifI knew
I'd tell you?

31:27.180 --> 31:29.114
Because you could
get into trouble

31:29.150 --> 31:30.378
with your
P.I. firm

31:30.420 --> 31:32.081
for warning me
about the arrest.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.315
Really?
Mm-hmm.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.056
After I help you, keep you safe,

31:37.090 --> 31:38.580
out of the goodness of my heart,

31:38.630 --> 31:40.029
you're gonna use
that against me?

31:41.460 --> 31:43.257
Who's the CI.
in Bishop's crew?

31:45.730 --> 31:48.335
(ringing)

31:52.640 --> 31:54.938
Hello.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.971
Eli.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.648
I'm surprised. How are you?

31:58.680 --> 32:00.079
Good.
Good, Mr. State's Attorney.

32:00.110 --> 32:01.543
I have some great news for you.

32:01.580 --> 32:02.649
The governor has reconsidered.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.079
He wants to endorse you.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.008
Well, that is music to my ears.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.086
When did
that happen?
Shh.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.348
There's just one thing

32:09.390 --> 32:10.550
I need you to do for me, James.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.182
Peter's a proud man.

32:12.230 --> 32:14.698
You'll need to ask him again.

32:14.730 --> 32:16.027
Why?

32:16.060 --> 32:17.027
He can't be_ seen
reversmg himself

32:17.060 --> 32:18.527
without you making some effort.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.526
I'm not going to kiss
the ring again, Eli.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.162
I know, you don't have to.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.065
I'll arrange for a meeting
tomorrow afternoon.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.737
Trust me, it's just a formality.

32:25.770 --> 32:27.977
I'll see
you then.

32:29.140 --> 32:31.108
Okay. Huh?

32:31.150 --> 32:33.038
Your father's
a smart man.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.548
(indistinct conversations)

32:35.580 --> 32:37.571
How'd your
preliminary go?

32:37.620 --> 32:39.440
Well, I told the public
defender what you said.

32:39.490 --> 32:40.741
He said he'd try it.
Thanks.

32:40.790 --> 32:42.212
Hey,

32:42.260 --> 32:43.716
sometimes the law
is nothing more

32:43.760 --> 32:44.749
than calling
another man's bluff.

32:44.790 --> 32:46.587
(laughs)

32:46.630 --> 32:49.053
Well, you could help me
with something else, Cary.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.261
What?

32:51.300 --> 32:52.767
Bishop.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.631
He wants me to cut
your finger off.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.138
I told him you were okay,
I didn't need to.

32:58.170 --> 33:00.035
You knew who your friends were.

33:00.070 --> 33:01.606
I do.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.709
Yeah, so that's
why I'm here.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.105
To remind you.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.549
I mean, you talk to the SA,

33:05.580 --> 33:06.774
you ask about any kind of deal,

33:06.810 --> 33:08.141
you're dead.

33:08.180 --> 33:10.045
You understand?

33:10.080 --> 33:12.787
I do, I do. I do.

33:12.820 --> 33:15.755
Good. Now-now, I have
to do this, all right?

33:15.790 --> 33:18.020
You fell down against the
bars and you cut yourself.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.482
What?
Even to your lawyer,

33:19.530 --> 33:20.622
that's what you say.
You fell down

33:20.660 --> 33:21.695
against the bars,
you cut yourself.

33:21.730 --> 33:23.618
You're not sure how.

33:23.660 --> 33:24.797
Just yell "Guard."

33:24.830 --> 33:26.491
What?

33:26.530 --> 33:27.690
It's a test, all right?

33:27.730 --> 33:29.061
Bishop wants to help you,

33:29.100 --> 33:31.637
but he needs to know
you understand.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.069
So, count to four,

33:33.110 --> 33:34.179
and yell "Guard."

33:34.210 --> 33:35.234
I-I-I. ..

33:43.750 --> 33:46.548
(strained):
Guard...

33:46.590 --> 33:48.182
Guard!

33:54.400 --> 33:57.198
I just fell down.
It's nothing serious.

33:57.230 --> 34:00.267
You cut yourself
falling down?

34:00.300 --> 34:03.360
A... Against the bars. Yeah.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.733
Cary, are you being intimidated?

34:06.770 --> 34:08.374
Because we can
get you transferred.

34:08.410 --> 34:10.378
No, everything is good.

34:10.410 --> 34:11.741
What else do you have?

34:11.780 --> 34:13.407
Well, we want to win this

34:13.450 --> 34:15.247
in preliminary hearing,
but we don't know

34:15.280 --> 34:17.248
what the state's attorney has.
And bail?

34:17.280 --> 34:19.145
We're working on it.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.283
How much does
Florrick-Agos have?

34:21.320 --> 34:23.049
A portion.

34:26.590 --> 34:28.751
Ask my dad.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.552
I hate asking him,
but he might come up

34:30.600 --> 34:32.625
with the rest.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.694
You already tried him?
No, no.

34:33.730 --> 34:35.732
I'll give him a call.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.761
Okay.

34:38.740 --> 34:41.800
Did the dad
offer anything?

34:41.840 --> 34:44.604
$8,000.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.244
I'll see what I
can come up With.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.770
...a thousand registered Cook
County voters all considered

34:48.820 --> 34:51.448
likely voters,
Castro polled better

34:51.490 --> 34:54.687
than your three alternates--
Jenlowe, Hart and Barnwright.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.187
How much better?

34:56.220 --> 34:57.357
12 to 14 points.

34:57.390 --> 34:59.585
Did you try any
other names?

35:01.860 --> 35:03.327
What?

35:03.360 --> 35:05.726
Your Wife, Mr. Governor.
Eli, I said no.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.193
The poll was already
in the works.
I don't care. She's not running.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.537
You don't want
to hear the results?

35:09.570 --> 35:10.867
I can guess. She did well.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.834
She's a brand. So What?

35:12.870 --> 35:15.373
She polled eight points

35:15.410 --> 35:17.401
higher than Castro.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.874
She beat him in
every demographic.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.845
We polled every political
name against Castro.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.381
And she's the only one who won.

35:24.420 --> 35:25.887
Handedly.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.785
And her favorables, Bonita?

35:27.820 --> 35:30.380
They're at 80%. She's the most
popular name in Chicago.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.819
Well, because she's
not in politics.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.748
Put her in politics,

35:33.790 --> 35:35.257
and she becomes a politician.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.790
People hate politicians.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.628
Bonita, would you
step out for a second?

35:44.810 --> 35:46.903
Peter, I am your chief of staff.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.908
It is my job is to keep you
from being hit

35:48.940 --> 35:50.430
by the knowns and the unknowns.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.845
What are the unknowns?

35:51.880 --> 35:54.815
Your intern not wearing
any panties.

35:54.850 --> 35:56.772
(laughs)

35:56.820 --> 35:58.811
You're kidding, right?

35:58.850 --> 35:59.919
Your intern

35:59.950 --> 36:02.453
comes to work sans panties.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.458
And lifts her dress up
in the middle of work.

36:04.490 --> 36:05.787
Well, hell, Eli,
tell her not to.

36:05.830 --> 36:06.956
It's Lauren, Peter.
Your intern.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.958
The one you won't let me fire.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.820
I told you not to fire her.

36:10.860 --> 36:13.897
I didn't tell you to let her run
around like a cat in heat.

36:13.930 --> 36:15.932
I have no control over someone
I can't fire! Someone you're...

36:15.970 --> 36:19.360
Look, What does this have to do
with Alicia running?

36:19.410 --> 36:20.866
I did scandal polling.

36:20.910 --> 36:23.401
Dear God!
Using all fictitious names.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.579
The possibility of you surviving
another sexual scandal

36:25.610 --> 36:27.248
if Alicia doesn't
stand beside you.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.975
You know what? This is sick.
What's sick

36:29.020 --> 36:31.818
is that I'm the one trying
to keep Alicia on board.
Yes.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.317
Because you're
not married to her.

36:33.350 --> 36:34.351
Exactly!

36:34.390 --> 36:35.812
(low grumbling)

36:35.860 --> 36:38.920
Castro wants to meet.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.951
What?

36:40.990 --> 36:43.550
Castro wants to make another
case for your endorsement.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.568
He pleaded with me
for a meeting.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.568
If we're not having Alicia run,

36:47.600 --> 36:49.591
you should listen to him.

36:51.740 --> 36:53.264
Alicia, you have
a few clients here...

36:53.310 --> 36:54.971
Diane said that

36:55.010 --> 36:56.500
she'd kick in some
money for Cary's bail.

36:56.540 --> 36:57.677
We need to call
her and get her...

36:57.710 --> 36:58.904
Alicia, wait.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.599
Bishop is here.

37:00.650 --> 37:02.208
What? Why?

37:03.980 --> 37:05.789
(indistinct chatter)

37:08.960 --> 37:09.881
Mr. Bishop, hello.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.854
Uh, you should've called.

37:11.890 --> 37:12.925
Is everything all right?

37:12.960 --> 37:14.518
Yes. Thank you.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.949
I'm here to have_
a general conversation

37:17.000 --> 37:19.366
about my business holdings.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.665
Okay. I'm-I'm not...

37:22.700 --> 37:25.533
How can I help you with that?
Actually...

37:25.570 --> 37:27.265
why don't I wait here
while you deal

37:27.310 --> 37:29.972
with the gentleman at your desk?

37:30.010 --> 37:32.001
Okay.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.481
Mr. Roja, hello.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.987
How can I help you?

37:40.020 --> 37:42.909
Yes. Uh, we've met before,
Mrs. Florrick.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.281
I own a string of businesses,
which includes

37:45.330 --> 37:47.321
dry cleaners and health clubs.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.998
Yes. I know.

37:49.030 --> 37:49.928
I...

37:49.960 --> 37:51.894
have decided to pay

37:51.930 --> 37:53.363
your partner's bail.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.937
You decided?

37:55.970 --> 37:58.063
This is, uh...

37:58.100 --> 38:00.762
1.5 mill.

38:00.810 --> 38:02.300
That should cover the bail.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.569
The bail is 1.3.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.976
Okay, uh...

38:10.420 --> 38:12.718
Okay...

38:12.750 --> 38:13.887
1.3 million.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.615
I would suggest
that you take that

38:15.660 --> 38:17.878
to the bank
and get a cashier's check.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.456
Excuse me.

38:19.490 --> 38:21.651
(clears throat)

38:24.060 --> 38:26.665
Just so you know.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.032
I was here to ta|k_over
my busmess holdings.

38:29.070 --> 38:32.506
I had nothing to do with
Mr. Roja's business.

38:32.540 --> 38:35.509
Do we understand each other?

38:35.540 --> 38:37.679
Yes.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.710
Well, why don't I let
you two talk?

38:50.790 --> 38:52.052
(door closes)

38:52.090 --> 38:54.888
So...

38:54.930 --> 38:57.922
you want my endorsement?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.928
Actually I was told

38:59.970 --> 39:02.359
that you had had a
change of heart.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.136
MARISSA:
So, What does this do?

39:06.170 --> 39:07.967
Peter thinks Castro
wants the meeting.

39:08.010 --> 39:09.898
Castro thinks Peter
wants the meeting.

39:09.940 --> 39:12.704
They're both prideful and...
(shouting nearby)

39:12.750 --> 39:15.014
(Peter and Castro yelling
over each other angrily)

39:15.050 --> 39:18.110
I want to learn your job.

39:18.150 --> 39:19.412
No, you don't.

39:19.450 --> 39:21.452
I think I'd be good at it.

39:21.490 --> 39:23.685
(door opens)
CASTRO:
Absolutely ridiculous!

39:23.720 --> 39:26.120
Thanks a lot, Eli.

39:38.100 --> 39:40.568
Everything all right,
Mr. Governor?

39:40.610 --> 39:44.034
Um...

39:44.080 --> 39:47.106
find out if Alicia wants to run.

39:53.950 --> 39:56.919
Look, all I know
is Diane is retiring.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.929
We just think you should know
something about Florrick-Agos.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.554
Cary Agos was arrested

40:02.600 --> 40:04.568
on a drug charge.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.965
What?

40:06.000 --> 40:09.094
Florrick-Agos is
an outlaw firm.

40:09.140 --> 40:13.008
We advise you to stay with
a family laW firm like...

40:13.040 --> 40:15.031
Lockhart/Gardner/Canning.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.900
SOPHIA:
Nice offices, Kalinda.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.646
It's very impressive.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.602
Can I have some
bottled water?

40:25.120 --> 40:26.815
How about some ice?

40:26.850 --> 40:29.080
How about you tell me
who the CI. is.

40:29.120 --> 40:32.089
(grunts)

40:32.130 --> 40:33.222
I can't.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.091
Okay.

40:35.130 --> 40:37.621
Who is that?
Your boss.

40:37.660 --> 40:39.799
I'm telling him you warned me
off so I wouldn't be arrested.

40:39.830 --> 40:41.661
That'd be a bitchy
thing to do.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.691
Hi. Can I speak
to Mr. Redmond, please?

40:43.740 --> 40:45.037
If you want me
to help you,

40:45.070 --> 40:46.537
hang up the phone.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.035
I can't tell you
who the CI. is.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.605
Kalinda, you would tell Bishop.

40:53.650 --> 40:54.878
Bishop would have him killed.

40:57.050 --> 40:59.018
But there is a C.I.?

40:59.050 --> 41:01.689
Your friend, Cary?

41:01.720 --> 41:03.051
He's guilty.

41:03.090 --> 41:05.957
He's going away
for 20 years.

41:05.990 --> 41:07.150
Guilty of what?

41:07.190 --> 41:08.953
He told Bishop's crew
how to avoid

41:09.000 --> 41:10.888
getting arrested
for the latest shipment.

41:10.930 --> 41:13.160
That's conspiracy.
That's according to a CI.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.997
(laughs)
A C.I. who has reason to lie.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.996
No, it's not.
It's according to this.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.935
There's a recording.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.174
JUDGE:
1.3 million in bail.
I should frame this.

41:25.210 --> 41:28.043
Yeah. I know.
I felt the same way.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.173
As you can see, Your Honor,
as angering as the defense has

41:30.220 --> 41:32.814
found this extortionist
bail, we have met it.

41:32.850 --> 41:35.216
Cary Agos should be released.
Yes. That seems clear.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.909
Unless there's anything
further, ASA?

41:36.960 --> 41:38.985
(Whispering)

41:39.030 --> 41:40.179
ASA Polmar?

41:40.230 --> 41:42.050
What's he doing?
I don't know.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.056
Your Honor, we object to
these funds and we...

41:44.100 --> 41:46.591
What? You object?
Yeah, and we ask
for a Source of Funds hearing.

41:46.630 --> 41:48.097
Your Honor, this is
a delaying tactic.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.836
We believe these funds are
derived from drug sales,

41:49.870 --> 41:51.838
Your Honor, the very charge
against the defendant.

41:51.870 --> 41:53.303
You believe? An innocent man
is being held in holding.

41:53.340 --> 41:54.978
The defendant has been
charged with conspiracy

41:55.010 --> 41:56.637
to transport drugs.
We would argue

41:56.680 --> 41:58.033
that this bail money is
a pay off for that action.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.968
It is money derived from a drug
dealer protecting his own.

42:00.010 --> 42:01.671
There are so
many supp05itions

42:01.720 --> 42:03.915
in that argument,
Your Honor, I don't

42:03.950 --> 42:05.019
even know Where to begin.
Well, why don't we begin

42:05.050 --> 42:07.086
with a Source of Funds hearing?

42:07.120 --> 42:08.280
(arguing over each other)

42:08.320 --> 42:09.685
Excuse me! No, no!

42:09.720 --> 42:11.278
No, no, no! Both of you,

42:11.320 --> 42:14.892
step back behind the bar.

42:14.930 --> 42:17.319
Behind the bar.

42:17.360 --> 42:20.022
Given the size of
this bail posting,

42:20.070 --> 42:21.196
I Will schedule
a Source of Funds hearing

42:21.230 --> 42:22.333
one week from today.

42:22.370 --> 42:23.997
DIANE:
In the meantime, we ask

42:24.040 --> 42:25.337
that Mr. Agos be released,
Your Honor.

42:25.370 --> 42:27.065
Mr. Agos Will remain
as our guest

42:27.110 --> 42:29.135
until we can establish
that these funds did not come

42:29.180 --> 42:31.842
from the sale of drugs.
(gavelbangs)

42:31.880 --> 42:33.040
Is it from Bishop?

42:33.080 --> 42:35.913
Not specifically.

42:35.950 --> 42:37.144
Cary, we'll get you out soon!

42:37.180 --> 42:39.887
Stay safe!

42:41.150 --> 42:43.209
(door slams)

42:43.260 --> 42:46.024
MAN:
Stay to the right!

42:46.060 --> 42:48.790
Keep your eyes down!

42:48.830 --> 42:50.024
Eight bodies moving!

42:50.060 --> 42:52.221
(indistinct chatter)

42:52.270 --> 42:53.760
Hey!

42:53.800 --> 42:55.233
KaHnda?

42:55.270 --> 42:56.669
Hey!

42:56.700 --> 42:57.962
SHERIFF:
What did I just tell you?

42:58.000 --> 42:59.228
I told you to keep
your eyes down!

42:59.270 --> 43:00.635
You understand me?
Do you understand me?!

43:00.670 --> 43:02.331
I understand.
