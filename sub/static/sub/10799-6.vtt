00:19.000 --> 00:20.930
Another Coco-no-no?

00:21.100 --> 00:23.430
No, thanks, I think I've had enough.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.170
Yeah. Me too.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.820
I almost forgot.

01:07.680 --> 01:10.510
I'm sorry.
I think I'd better go back.

01:10.650 --> 01:13.650
Too chilly?
I can turn down the breeze.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.550
It's been a lovely program.

01:15.720 --> 01:18.590
- Yeah.
- You're a terrific guy.

01:18.760 --> 01:19.890
Yeah.

01:22.660 --> 01:25.060
I just don't feel that way about you.

01:27.230 --> 01:28.600
Yeah.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.270
Knock it off.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.490
This was the final battle, wasn't it?

01:57.600 --> 02:01.270
Neither side expected Orelious IX
to be the decisive conflict.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.740
There's not much left.

02:05.900 --> 02:09.270
The destruction is remarkable,
considering the primitive period.

02:17.650 --> 02:19.180
I beg your pardon?

02:20.080 --> 02:22.490
Geordi had a big date
with Christi tonight.

02:22.650 --> 02:25.120
He spent days
working up the perfect program.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.530
Looks like it ended early.

02:32.700 --> 02:36.100
- Cmdr Data to the bridge.
- Acknowledged.

02:40.600 --> 02:44.440
We're picking up a signal,
coordinates 21 1 mark 61.

02:44.610 --> 02:48.010
It would seem to be
an ancient interplanetary code.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.190
- Mr Data?
- Confirmed, sir.

02:55.850 --> 02:59.660
Survivors on Orelious IX,
after all this time? Not possible.

02:59.820 --> 03:01.890
Well, hardly possible, Number One.

03:02.060 --> 03:04.530
Lay in a course for the source.

03:19.040 --> 03:22.280
- Approaching source, Captain.
- Put it on the viewer.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.360
A Promellian battle cruiser?

03:37.090 --> 03:39.760
With its Lang-cycle fusion engines
intact.

03:42.470 --> 03:44.970
Sensors indicate
no life signs aboard, Captain.

03:45.140 --> 03:48.970
I should hope not.
That ship belongs in a museum.

03:51.380 --> 03:53.440
I'm afraid we're a little late.

03:54.710 --> 03:57.780
That call for help
was probably initiated...

03:58.650 --> 04:00.650
...over a thousand years ago.

04:31.780 --> 04:34.990
Space, the final frontier.

04:36.420 --> 04:39.990
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

04:40.590 --> 04:44.500
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

04:46.030 --> 04:49.300
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

04:50.670 --> 04:54.110
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.100
Captain's log, stardate 43205.6.

05:57.270 --> 06:00.370
We have arrived at Orelious IX
to chart the battle

06:00.540 --> 06:04.440
in which the Menthars and
Promellians fought to extinction.

06:04.610 --> 06:08.110
Among the ruins,
we found a Promellian battle cruiser

06:08.280 --> 06:10.080
that has withstood the centuries.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.580
Indulge me.

06:11.750 --> 06:15.590
I would prefer it if I could run
a security sweep.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.220
No. Captain's prerogative.
This one's mine.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.490
We have examined
every conceivable risk.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.900
The risks on a ship this old
and fragile are inconceivable.

06:25.430 --> 06:27.000
Ghosts, perhaps?

06:28.230 --> 06:32.600
Number One, have you never dreamed...

06:33.270 --> 06:35.470
of climbing inside the bottle?

06:36.370 --> 06:37.440
Sir?

06:38.310 --> 06:40.110
The ship in the bottle.

06:42.350 --> 06:43.880
Model airships.

06:44.050 --> 06:47.120
I used to build them as a child.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.320
I bet I had
a Promellian battle cruiser.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.690
- Ready to beam down?
- Locked on, Captain.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.730
Certain about the atmosphere?

06:55.890 --> 06:58.460
There is adequate oxygen
for life support.

06:58.630 --> 07:02.470
It is exactly as they left it.
In the bottle.

07:05.970 --> 07:07.510
The ship... Good Lord,

07:07.670 --> 07:10.510
didn't anybody build
ships in bottles as boys?

07:11.210 --> 07:13.240
I did not play with toys.

07:15.180 --> 07:16.880
I was never a boy.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.580
I did, sir.

07:21.490 --> 07:23.250
Thank you, Mr O'Brien.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.560
Proceed.

07:35.770 --> 07:38.340
I did. I really did.

07:39.170 --> 07:41.170
Ships in bottles. Great fun.

07:43.910 --> 07:47.750
- What's that?
- The power bus may need adjusting.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.210
Keep me posted.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.560
Extraordinary!

08:38.429 --> 08:39.799
Admirable.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.200
They died at their posts.

08:57.480 --> 09:00.720
You'd expect the bridge layout
of this era

09:00.890 --> 09:02.690
to be clumsy, awkward.

09:04.790 --> 09:06.820
But look at this.

09:07.490 --> 09:09.290
It's a model of simplicity.

09:09.990 --> 09:11.800
Elegant. Functional.

09:14.170 --> 09:18.640
They built this craft
for generations, and it worked.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.750
Don't you have anything stronger,
Guinan?

09:29.910 --> 09:31.920
- Yes.
- Would it help?

09:32.420 --> 09:33.820
No.

09:34.890 --> 09:37.320
Tell me something.
You're a woman, right?

09:39.060 --> 09:41.090
Yes, I'm a woman.

09:41.730 --> 09:45.330
- What do you want in a man?
- Personally?

09:45.760 --> 09:49.430
As a woman,
what's the first thing you look at?

09:50.770 --> 09:53.640
- His head.
- His mind.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.910
- Of course.
- No, his head.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.780
I'm attracted to bald men.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.420
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

10:05.420 --> 10:06.720
Why?

10:06.880 --> 10:10.290
Maybe because a bald man
was kind to me once

10:10.450 --> 10:12.920
when I was hurting, took care of me.

10:14.930 --> 10:18.900
- I'd like to do that.
- I take care of myself now.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.130
I mean, take care of somebody.

10:23.670 --> 10:27.910
I just don't get it.
I can fieldstrip a fusion reactor.

10:28.070 --> 10:30.070
I can realign power-transfer tunnels.

10:30.170 --> 10:33.280
Why can't I make anything work
with Christi?

10:33.440 --> 10:36.750
It's like...
I don't know what to say.

10:37.350 --> 10:40.620
- You're doing fine with me.
- You're different.

10:40.750 --> 10:42.450
No, you're different.

10:42.590 --> 10:46.260
- But I'm not trying now.
- That's my point.

10:56.970 --> 10:58.470
What is it?

10:58.600 --> 11:01.310
The main power returner
is acting weird.

11:01.470 --> 11:03.370
Define weird.

11:03.770 --> 11:06.280
I'm getting
fluctuating waveguide readings.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.510
- Run a maintenance sweep.
- Right.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.620
Activating power pack, Captain.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.900
Mr Worf, get tricorder images
of their tactical display.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.330
Aye, sir.

11:27.500 --> 11:31.740
The source of the distress signal
is coming from up there.

11:36.540 --> 11:39.210
Let's end their last cry for help.

11:45.620 --> 11:46.920
Captain.

11:48.450 --> 11:51.290
I believe this is
an information storage device.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.530
A crude analogue
of our isolinear optical chip.

11:54.690 --> 11:57.260
Crude by our standards today, Data.

11:57.430 --> 12:02.430
But when this ship was built, humans
were perfecting the mechanical clock.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.970
Still using steel crossbows
in battle.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.640
- Any way to see what's on this?
- Questionable.

12:10.110 --> 12:13.740
I believe I can supply power
to its playback unit.

12:13.910 --> 12:15.910
Its components are quite old.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.280
I will amplify the image
with my tricorder.

12:27.090 --> 12:28.730
I am Galek Sar,

12:29.590 --> 12:32.660
Captain of the Promellian cruiser,
Cleponji.

12:33.230 --> 12:36.230
I wish anyone who finds this
to know...

12:36.670 --> 12:39.500
my crew has behaved courageously.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.910
I want it recorded for all time

12:45.410 --> 12:46.940
that I alone

12:47.110 --> 12:49.910
am responsible for the fate
that befell us.

12:50.450 --> 12:53.350
I have failed as a captain...

12:53.520 --> 12:58.160
...and as the man responsible
for all the souls aboard my ship.

13:03.990 --> 13:07.060
- Picard to Enterprise.
- Go ahead, Captain.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.900
I think we have seen
all there is here.

13:11.070 --> 13:14.640
At Mr O'Brien's leisure,
we're ready to return.

13:15.140 --> 13:16.510
Aye, sir.

13:21.380 --> 13:22.580
Thrilling.

13:23.910 --> 13:27.050
That was... absolutely thrilling.

13:28.850 --> 13:33.190
And I was right. There were ghosts
on board. One spoke to us.

13:33.590 --> 13:36.860
- A friendly one, I hope?
- My own counterpart.

13:37.030 --> 13:40.260
The captain's final message,
praising his crew.

13:40.430 --> 13:42.700
I hope you'll be as thoughtful.

13:43.570 --> 13:45.870
Mr Data, revise the annexe.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.710
This should be catalogued
and then retrieved.

13:58.350 --> 14:03.190
I'm sorry, it's just a rare pleasure
to see this side of your personality.

14:05.690 --> 14:09.030
Mr Crusher, set course
for the original coordinates.

14:09.190 --> 14:13.100
Captain, we are experiencing a
two percent drop in energy reserves.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.400
Compensating.

14:14.570 --> 14:16.200
We were having problems...

14:18.600 --> 14:22.270
We are being bombarded
with high-intensity radiation.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.310
- Shields up!
- Captain, energy loss increasing.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.980
- Yellow alert.
- Aye, sir.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.950
Energy loss increasing.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.560
Mr Crusher.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.720
Reverse course. Full impulse power.

14:41.930 --> 14:43.730
No response, sir.

14:47.670 --> 14:51.870
- Increase speed to warp one.
- Engines aren't responding.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.140
Mr La Forge, warp power now!

14:54.470 --> 14:57.210
Matter-antimatter
mixture-ratio settings

14:57.370 --> 14:58.980
at optimum balance.

14:59.140 --> 15:03.050
Reaction sequence
corresponding to specified norms.

15:03.210 --> 15:07.380
Magnetic-plasma transfer to
warp-field generators as specified.

15:07.550 --> 15:11.120
Commander, we should be going
like a bat out of hell.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.560
- Power loss now 1 2 percent.
- Red alert.

15:15.330 --> 15:17.190
Radiation intensity increasing.

15:17.900 --> 15:21.400
We'd better slow these engines down
before we burn out.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.570
To idle, Geordi.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.740
Is it possible...

15:28.010 --> 15:31.980
that we've fallen
into the same snare that killed them?

15:32.510 --> 15:34.750
A 1,000-year-old booby trap?

15:50.190 --> 15:52.400
Even with the engines idling,

15:52.560 --> 15:55.400
our reserves will be depleted
in three hours.

15:55.570 --> 15:57.570
We won't hold our shields.

15:57.740 --> 16:01.410
Mr Worf, have you identified
the source of the radiation?

16:01.570 --> 16:04.910
The radiation field
is too strong for our sensors.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.580
And no explanation
for the energy loss?

16:07.910 --> 16:08.880
No, sir.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.420
Is there anything
in the history books, Data?

16:12.580 --> 16:15.250
Fascinating records
of Menthar battle strategy.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.420
They were exceptionally innovative.

16:17.590 --> 16:21.130
They were first to use
the Kavis Teke elusive maneuver,

16:21.290 --> 16:23.990
as well as strategy
comparable to Napoleon's...

16:24.130 --> 16:27.770
- Any situation like this?
- No, sir.

16:29.130 --> 16:31.340
I recommend I return with a team.

16:31.500 --> 16:36.070
- They didn't have much success.
- But they knew their enemy.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.780
They may have known what caused this.

16:38.940 --> 16:44.280
Agreed. The impact of lowering
shields to get the away team out?

16:44.420 --> 16:47.690
- Negligible.
- And our energy conservation?

16:48.620 --> 16:52.160
Cmdr La Forge,
keep the Enterprise up and running.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.860
Data, join the away team. Find out
what happened on that ship.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.210
So why can't we move?

17:09.109 --> 17:10.540
Computer.

17:10.710 --> 17:14.040
As we increased power,
was there any counter-reaction?

17:14.210 --> 17:15.480
Affirmative.

17:15.650 --> 17:18.119
The opposing force
grew in direct proportion

17:18.280 --> 17:20.950
to the power output
of the Enterprise.

17:21.690 --> 17:24.890
So, it kept us
from forming a subspace field?

17:25.060 --> 17:26.859
That is correct.

17:41.510 --> 17:43.170
Computer...

17:43.670 --> 17:46.340
Who is this... L Brahms?

17:47.180 --> 17:49.480
Dr Leah Brahms, engineer.

17:49.650 --> 17:53.080
Daystrom Institute
Theoretical Propulsion Group.

17:53.920 --> 17:58.090
Galaxy-class starships.
Team seven, junior member.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.230
Junior member?

18:01.390 --> 18:04.230
Looks like
she wrote the book on propulsion.

18:04.860 --> 18:07.060
Call up subspace design logs.

18:07.230 --> 18:11.900
Select menu. Visual records
or L Brahms' voice entries.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.910
Voice entries.

18:16.110 --> 18:18.410
Theoretical propulsion logs,

18:18.580 --> 18:22.450
Federation Starship Enterprise.
Galaxy-class.

18:22.610 --> 18:26.550
Heading, Subspace.
Author, Leah Brahms.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.920
Geordi La Forge. How are you doing?

18:30.090 --> 18:33.120
- Specify program.
- Yeah. Down to work.

18:33.290 --> 18:35.090
You're absolutely right.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.330
I recommend we evacuate
all non-operational areas

18:43.470 --> 18:46.170
and group crew
on the odd-numbered decks.

18:46.340 --> 18:47.300
Proceed.

18:47.470 --> 18:51.180
I'd like to set up an area
for treating radiation symptoms.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.750
After the shields fall,
how long before fatal exposure?

18:56.450 --> 19:00.650
30 minutes. After that,
there is nothing that can be done.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.490
Away team to Enterprise.
Captain, we may have found something.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.290
There's a file of memory coils here.

19:07.460 --> 19:10.490
They are identical to the coil
we found earlier.

19:10.660 --> 19:13.530
- Captain's log?
- That's what we were thinking.

19:14.030 --> 19:17.100
- Mr Data, are they working?
- I believe so.

19:17.270 --> 19:20.300
We can enhance them
through the image processor.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.670
- Good. Return at once.
- Aye, sir.

19:24.310 --> 19:25.640
Computer.

19:25.810 --> 19:29.010
Generate a cross-section
of the dilithium-crystal chamber.

19:34.020 --> 19:37.460
What about re-orienting the crystal?

19:37.960 --> 19:40.720
It is possible
to re-orient the crystal.

19:40.860 --> 19:44.330
The key lies in adjusting
the lattice-structure direction.

19:44.500 --> 19:48.330
This modification will be integrated
in the next-class starship.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.500
Sorry, can't wait.

19:51.670 --> 19:55.870
You and me, Leah, we've got two hours
to figure this out.

19:58.340 --> 20:01.010
You know what I need to do?

20:01.180 --> 20:03.350
I need to get inside there.

20:03.710 --> 20:07.420
I need to be able
to turn it inside out.

20:07.590 --> 20:12.020
Computer, is there a cross-section
we can replicate on the holodeck?

20:12.120 --> 20:16.430
Select menu. Design specifications
or prototype schematic.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.400
Prototype? Elaborate.

20:20.100 --> 20:23.770
A development-stage prototype
schematic at Utopia Planitia.

20:24.400 --> 20:29.740
Drafting room five of
the Mars station, stardate 40174.

20:29.870 --> 20:33.540
Perfect. Recreate it
in holodeck three. Stay with me, doc.

20:43.420 --> 20:45.090
Ready, Computer?

20:45.420 --> 20:47.830
Holodeck three program is ready.

20:56.970 --> 20:58.640
Damn!

21:01.570 --> 21:04.340
Right back where it all started.

21:18.190 --> 21:21.360
This is incredible!

21:22.890 --> 21:25.800
Leah, did you design this?

21:26.700 --> 21:31.370
The dilithium-crystal chamber was
designed at Outpost Seran T-One...

21:31.540 --> 21:34.210
...stardate 40052.

21:34.370 --> 21:36.640
Some of the Federation's best minds

21:36.810 --> 21:38.810
participated in its development.

21:38.980 --> 21:42.650
That's the visiting-dignitary talk.
What's the inside story?

21:43.150 --> 21:44.650
Off the record.

21:44.820 --> 21:47.750
Access denied.
Personal logs are restricted.

21:48.350 --> 21:52.220
Great! Another woman who won't get
personal with me on the holodeck.

21:53.820 --> 21:54.930
Leah.

21:55.090 --> 21:57.600
I want to supplement
the energy supply

21:57.730 --> 22:00.200
to the ship and the engines.

22:00.360 --> 22:04.070
Could we alter
the matter-antimatter paths?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.770
Theoretically, yes.

22:05.940 --> 22:08.010
The system should accept reactants

22:08.170 --> 22:10.210
at a faster rate of injection.

22:11.040 --> 22:14.080
Well, this is your baby.
Show me which ones.

22:34.630 --> 22:37.400
Computer, did I ask for a simulation?

22:37.570 --> 22:40.600
Affirmative.
You asked Dr Brahms to show you

22:40.770 --> 22:44.210
which system could accept reactants
at a faster rate.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.280
By accessing available imagery,

22:46.440 --> 22:49.110
an adequate facsimile was possible.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.750
I did do that, didn't I?

22:54.090 --> 22:57.350
OK, well...
It's good to see you, Leah.

23:02.260 --> 23:04.260
Continue with your analysis.

23:05.430 --> 23:10.030
Systems L-452 through L-575
will accept reactants,

23:10.200 --> 23:13.700
providing all other systems
are calibrated to an equal factor.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.210
Then, if we use multiple streams
hitting more than one facet...

23:18.840 --> 23:21.150
...we could do it, hold our own.

23:21.310 --> 23:24.180
Leah, you're beautiful.
La Forge to Picard.

23:24.350 --> 23:25.480
Go ahead.

23:25.650 --> 23:28.890
We found a way to extend
the energy supplies.

23:29.050 --> 23:32.220
- Well done.
- Can you get us out of here?

23:32.390 --> 23:36.460
Sorry, Commander, the first priority
was to maintain the shields.

23:36.630 --> 23:40.130
- Acknowledged.
- We'll get to work on it.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.300
Pass my congratulations to your team.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.370
Thanks, Captain.
We're all smiles down here.

23:49.070 --> 23:52.210
Captain, we've been able to verify

23:52.380 --> 23:55.880
that these coils are the logs
of the Promellian captain.

23:56.050 --> 23:59.580
But most of them have decayed
and cannot be repaired.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.350
Any playback?

24:02.520 --> 24:06.360
On most, there are brief sections
which may yield information.

24:06.520 --> 24:10.530
Do your best. Let's hope
we can get the section we need.

24:11.230 --> 24:14.830
The Promellian must have logged
the cause of the death.

24:15.700 --> 24:19.900
All in an open locker? He wasn't
too concerned with security.

24:24.580 --> 24:27.550
452 through system L-575.

24:28.110 --> 24:31.280
Adjustments to
dilithium-crystal chamber complete.

24:31.450 --> 24:33.620
Impact analysis, Computer.

24:33.780 --> 24:36.550
Warp energy has increased
1 4 percent.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.160
Reactants per unit time
remaining steady.

24:39.820 --> 24:41.630
Yes! Alright!

24:47.800 --> 24:49.400
Computer...

24:49.830 --> 24:51.400
Do you have any...

24:51.570 --> 24:55.310
you know,
personality on file for Dr Brahms?

24:56.140 --> 25:01.180
Starfleet personality
profile analysis, stardate 40056.

25:03.110 --> 25:07.120
Did she ever debate at the
intergalactic caucuses on Chaya VII?

25:07.920 --> 25:11.860
Dr Brahms attended the caucuses
on the following stardates...

25:12.020 --> 25:14.020
Never mind the dates. Computer...

25:14.590 --> 25:18.030
If you add data
from all these sources,

25:18.200 --> 25:22.530
could you synthesise
a true representation of Dr Brahms?

25:23.600 --> 25:27.170
There would be
a 9.37 percent margin of error

25:27.340 --> 25:30.440
in the interactive responses
from the facsimile.

25:31.540 --> 25:33.540
I can live with that.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.610
Do it.

25:51.360 --> 25:54.970
- Dr Brahms?
- Geordi, it's me, Leah.

25:55.130 --> 25:58.640
Don't call me Dr Brahms,
or I'll call you Commander.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.140
- Right.
- Now...

26:01.310 --> 26:04.510
We've maintained energy
but we can't leave it

26:04.680 --> 26:07.880
without burning out components.
So we need to move.

26:10.410 --> 26:13.180
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

26:13.350 --> 26:14.950
Yeah!

26:24.030 --> 26:26.460
We have been stripped
of all propulsion

26:26.630 --> 26:28.930
and our weapons are useless.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.600
We cannot move

26:32.570 --> 26:34.710
and we cannot fight.

26:35.110 --> 26:38.080
The ship is being lashed
with lethal radiation

26:38.240 --> 26:42.380
from the aceton assimilators
concealed in the wreckage around...

26:46.280 --> 26:50.490
- Aceton assimilators?
- Primitive generators

26:50.650 --> 26:52.920
which drain power
from distant sources.

26:53.090 --> 26:54.660
Generators?

26:54.830 --> 26:57.330
It would not be difficult
to modify them

26:57.500 --> 26:59.500
to convert energy into radiation.

27:00.730 --> 27:03.130
The Menthars hide them in debris.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.340
An unsuspecting ship flies in.

27:06.300 --> 27:07.840
Instant booby trap.

27:08.010 --> 27:11.940
Now we're supplying the devices
with the energy to kill us.

27:14.350 --> 27:16.610
- No.
- Listen to me!

27:16.780 --> 27:18.750
You can't boost power that way.

27:18.920 --> 27:22.320
You increase the speed of the
subspace field processor...

27:22.490 --> 27:26.820
I want enough power to barrel
out of here, not blow us up.

27:26.990 --> 27:29.430
This is my design
we're talking about.

27:29.590 --> 27:33.330
I don't care if you built it
with your bare hands.

27:33.500 --> 27:37.270
It's gonna go...
And we'll go with it.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.640
I am not used to being questioned.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.840
And I'm not used to dying.

27:44.210 --> 27:48.710
OK, look. You worked in a lab
on a static model.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.650
This is a working machine.

27:50.820 --> 27:54.650
It's got tens of thousands
of light years on it.

27:56.350 --> 27:58.160
- True.
- Damn right.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.530
Listen.

28:06.660 --> 28:10.400
We'd never be certain
that the circuit paths are sealed.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.040
You're good.

28:21.050 --> 28:25.720
- Very good.
- I know my ship. Inside and out.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.250
Then you know me inside and out.

28:28.950 --> 28:31.760
Cos a lot of me is in here.

28:33.890 --> 28:37.360
I always wish a chief engineer
was present when a ship is built.

28:37.530 --> 28:40.930
Yeah. Designers never get out
in space.

28:42.270 --> 28:44.940
Well... you're there now.

28:49.240 --> 28:53.880
- Cmdr La Forge to the bridge.
- On my way, Commander.

28:55.150 --> 28:57.150
Don't go away.

28:58.380 --> 29:00.380
I mean...

29:01.250 --> 29:03.250
Computer, save program.

29:08.130 --> 29:10.630
How many devices are we dealing with,
Data?

29:10.800 --> 29:12.660
To create this radiation field

29:12.830 --> 29:14.830
would take several hundred thousand.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.900
They've been out there a long time.
Deterioration?

29:18.070 --> 29:21.340
There is no way to calculate that.
It is likely.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.440
Is there any indication of weakness
in the field?

29:24.610 --> 29:27.210
- Nothing substantial.
- Of any kind.

29:28.210 --> 29:32.350
Well, there is a 0.1 percent dip
in the radiation field at...

29:32.980 --> 29:35.290
21 mark eight by 42 mark zero.

29:35.720 --> 29:39.660
- I want that 0.1 percent.
- Fire at those coordinates.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.960
We won't maintain energy reserves.
We might even lose a few circuits.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.800
Critical losses?

29:45.960 --> 29:49.730
Not enough to shut down
but I don't know about the shields.

29:50.300 --> 29:53.970
There is also the possibility
that the phasers will supply

29:54.140 --> 29:56.140
what they need most. Energy.

29:57.480 --> 30:01.080
I imagine a similar discussion
taking place on our neighbor ship.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.910
Over 1,000 years ago.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.680
Let's hope our decisions
are more successful.

30:05.850 --> 30:10.020
Mr La Forge, return to Engineering
and continue without delay.

30:10.190 --> 30:11.760
Mr Worf.

30:12.990 --> 30:14.990
Prepare the phasers.

30:15.890 --> 30:17.900
Phasers locked on coordinates.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.760
Fire.

30:26.170 --> 30:27.610
Nothing.

30:27.770 --> 30:29.940
Radiation levels increasing.

30:30.110 --> 30:31.740
Eight percent.

30:31.910 --> 30:33.410
Ten percent.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.250
Energy reserves are dropping
rapidly, sir.

30:36.410 --> 30:37.920
Damn you.

30:38.850 --> 30:42.690
Wouldn't that increase the output
to gain a quicker response time?

30:42.850 --> 30:45.190
The processors can handle
the extra input.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.360
But how do we reconfigure?

30:47.890 --> 30:50.090
Energy reserves reaching critical.

30:50.430 --> 30:54.200
Standard procedure requires
termination of all simulations.

30:54.370 --> 30:56.370
Override standard procedure.

30:56.870 --> 30:59.440
- Override authority restricted.
- What?

31:00.810 --> 31:02.210
Computer!

31:14.250 --> 31:16.290
The crystal lattice is breaking down.

31:16.450 --> 31:18.760
We'll repair it at a starbase.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.620
The optimist of the group.

31:20.790 --> 31:24.430
How long do we have shields
based on current calculations?

31:24.600 --> 31:29.270
Under two hours. The radiation field
has increased by 1 7 percent.

31:29.830 --> 31:31.800
What impact on fatal exposure?

31:32.270 --> 31:33.970
Down to 26 minutes.

31:34.640 --> 31:38.780
If we resist, we die.
If we don't resist, we die.

31:40.540 --> 31:43.610
Mr La Forge, have we shut down
non-essential energy?

31:43.780 --> 31:47.790
Yes, sir. I need some back
for a program on holodeck three.

31:48.350 --> 31:50.820
- For what purpose?
- Well...

31:50.990 --> 31:54.630
I've gone back to the beginning,
to the earliest entries.

31:54.790 --> 31:58.630
I've created a propulsion
design model to assist me.

31:59.030 --> 32:01.030
I believe we're making progress.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.870
Computer,
reinstate holodeck three program.

32:04.030 --> 32:06.240
Holodeck three program
is reinstated.

32:07.070 --> 32:10.980
Mr La Forge,
your best suggestion in one hour.

32:11.310 --> 32:12.680
Picard out.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.080
Computer, holodeck three program.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.490
Enter when ready.

32:23.820 --> 32:25.590
There isn't much time left.

32:25.760 --> 32:30.060
We have to get out of here.
The booby trap eats energy.

32:30.230 --> 32:33.860
How do we fool it, block it,
shut it down?

32:34.030 --> 32:37.670
OK, we know that for every move
the Enterprise makes,

32:37.840 --> 32:40.670
there's a countermovement
by the energy field.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.240
Can we use that to our advantage?

32:43.440 --> 32:45.740
Maybe.
There must be a time differential

32:45.910 --> 32:47.610
between force and counterforce.

32:47.780 --> 32:51.280
If we can adjust the link-ups
before the counterforce reacts,

32:51.450 --> 32:53.820
we might just move this bucket.

32:53.980 --> 32:55.050
Yeah.

32:55.220 --> 32:56.320
Yes!

32:57.720 --> 33:00.160
Leah, do you like Italian food?

33:00.930 --> 33:04.560
Like it?
Wait till I make you my fungilli.

33:05.400 --> 33:10.130
OK. Fusion reactor uplink
to navigation processor.

33:22.950 --> 33:27.150
Then we have to adjust the vector
processor and the drive coils.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.690
This is impossible.

33:36.360 --> 33:40.030
- Don't do that.
- I thought it would feel good.

33:40.200 --> 33:44.170
I don't want to feel that good
right now. What time is it?

33:44.340 --> 33:46.340
Coming up on 1600 hours.

33:46.970 --> 33:50.340
God, what am I supposed
to tell the Captain?

33:50.510 --> 33:53.280
It's possible
and yet it's not possible.

33:53.440 --> 33:57.720
Everything says we can't adjust it
but if we could, it might work.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.380
I could do it.

33:59.550 --> 34:03.950
Data couldn't even do it. It'll take
a thousand adjustments a second.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.560
How will you do it?
It's humanly impossible.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.530
I'm not human.

34:11.230 --> 34:15.530
You...
You mean the computer could do it?

34:18.840 --> 34:20.400
Captain.

34:21.170 --> 34:22.770
Captain, this is...

34:24.010 --> 34:25.580
This is a simulation

34:25.739 --> 34:29.210
of the expert who designed
the engines, Leah Brahms.

34:31.620 --> 34:32.920
We...

34:33.080 --> 34:36.550
I've been examining the force-
counterforce response times,

34:36.719 --> 34:39.219
trying to create linkage
at maximum power.

34:39.690 --> 34:41.190
And?

34:41.360 --> 34:42.730
There's a...

34:43.429 --> 34:48.300
There's a chance we could if we turn
the ship over to the computer.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.139
- What chance?
- I don't know.

34:55.310 --> 34:58.410
We could program it and try it out.

34:58.810 --> 35:02.810
- And this is the only way?
- I think so, sir.

35:18.500 --> 35:19.830
Come.

35:22.170 --> 35:24.170
Any word from La Forge?

35:24.800 --> 35:28.110
He has something
that may give us a chance,

35:28.270 --> 35:30.510
if we stay out of it.

35:31.810 --> 35:35.610
He proposes to turn the ship
over to the computer

35:35.780 --> 35:39.750
because it is capable of quicker
adjustments than a human being.

35:41.690 --> 35:45.420
Computers always impress me
with their ability to take orders.

35:45.590 --> 35:49.030
I'm not as convinced
of their ability to give them.

35:52.330 --> 35:56.170
You know, Number One, you missed
something not playing with models.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.470
They were
the source of imaginary voyages,

36:00.640 --> 36:03.470
each holding
a treasure of adventures.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.510
Manning the earliest spacecraft,

36:05.640 --> 36:10.380
flying an aeroplane with only
one propeller to keep you in the sky.

36:11.350 --> 36:13.180
Can you imagine that?

36:15.320 --> 36:17.560
Now the machines are flying us.

36:23.730 --> 36:26.000
End simulation. Fatal exposure.

36:27.330 --> 36:30.700
Computer, reduce thrust levels
another four percent.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.440
Adjust trajectory angle
to compensate.

36:36.870 --> 36:38.580
Begin simulation again.

36:43.910 --> 36:48.350
- There you go, we got out.
- Repeat simulation, same levels.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.960
End simulation. Fatal exposure.

36:57.130 --> 37:00.700
Same variables, only
the computer didn't quite make it.

37:02.630 --> 37:06.370
Deflector shield failure.
Lethal radiation levels.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.870
Fatal exposure in 26 minutes.

37:23.290 --> 37:24.990
- It might work.
- It might not.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.120
I can't turn the ship over
to a computer.

37:27.290 --> 37:28.760
It's all we've got.

37:28.930 --> 37:31.760
- Picard to La Forge.
- Captain.

37:32.330 --> 37:34.570
Two minutes.
Give me just two minutes.

37:35.100 --> 37:38.600
There is another way, Captain.
Two minutes, please!

37:41.270 --> 37:44.280
Two minutes, Mr La Forge.
Picard out.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.680
- Geordi, there's no other way.
- Listen.

37:48.550 --> 37:52.620
Turn it around. Come at it
from the opposite direction.

37:52.780 --> 37:55.220
God, it's so simple it might work.

37:55.390 --> 37:58.490
OK. Computer, new simulation.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.330
We've only tried
overpowering the trap.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.570
More energy, faster adjustments.

38:08.700 --> 38:12.140
That's what we can't do
because we're supposed to do that.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.900
That's the booby trap.

38:14.070 --> 38:17.210
The answer lies in our own computer.
The mind.

38:17.370 --> 38:19.310
The best piece of engineering ever.

38:20.140 --> 38:24.050
Didn't your research indicate we need
a thousand adjustments per second?

38:24.220 --> 38:26.880
Not if we shut everything off.

38:27.890 --> 38:31.420
One blast of everything
for a microsecond to beat the inertia

38:31.590 --> 38:36.230
and then we shut down, except
for life-support and two thrusters.

38:37.160 --> 38:39.360
No impulse engines. No computer.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.170
One propeller?

38:41.330 --> 38:44.440
Deflector shield failure.
Lethal radiation levels.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.040
Fatal exposure in 12 minutes.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.870
Have you analyzed the risk?

38:50.370 --> 38:51.940
The numbers say even.

38:52.110 --> 38:55.110
It's no better than the computer,
but no worse.

38:55.280 --> 39:00.420
Forget the numbers. The computer
can't compensate for human intuition.

39:00.580 --> 39:03.920
- Experience.
- And the wish to stay alive.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.340
Make it so.

39:18.500 --> 39:21.570
I've run the simulations.
I'll take the con.

39:21.670 --> 39:25.110
Thank you, Mr La Forge.
You've done your job.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.640
I relieve you, Mr Crusher.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.980
Yes, sir.

39:37.460 --> 39:41.960
All hands, we are about to engage
engines for a short burst.

39:42.090 --> 39:44.030
Inertia dampeners are on manual.

39:44.160 --> 39:47.630
They may not compensate for
the acceleration. Brace yourselves.

39:48.530 --> 39:50.330
Deflector shield failure.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.040
Lethal radiation levels.

39:52.200 --> 39:55.670
Computer. Discontinue radiation
warning until further notice.

39:57.140 --> 40:00.180
- It's all yours, sir.
- Thank you.

40:07.450 --> 40:09.450
Firing impulse engines.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.830
Impulse engines down.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.470
Shutting down all systems.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.910
Velocity is 135 meters per second.

40:37.550 --> 40:40.520
We enter the debris field
in eight seconds.

40:53.260 --> 40:54.800
Starboard thruster.

40:58.300 --> 41:00.700
Coming to. Heading three-four-zero.

41:00.810 --> 41:02.240
Mark one-zero.

41:04.980 --> 41:06.610
Thruster is off.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.920
Captain, that large mass
may contain an assimilator.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.320
Port thrusters firing.

41:20.390 --> 41:22.130
No reaction from the assimilator.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.660
Over the first hurdle.

41:29.830 --> 41:31.600
Sir, object to port!

41:33.970 --> 41:35.670
Port thruster is firing.

41:36.910 --> 41:39.680
Sir,
the gravity of the various masses

41:39.840 --> 41:42.980
has reduced our velocity
by eight percent.

41:43.150 --> 41:47.150
By my calculations, we can
no longer clear the debris field.

41:47.320 --> 41:48.920
Thank you, Mr Data.

41:54.460 --> 41:57.030
The asteroid's gravitation
is drawing us closer.

41:57.190 --> 41:59.100
Velocity is increasing.

42:09.040 --> 42:13.510
Velocity is still increasing.
Now at 219 meters per second.

42:20.520 --> 42:22.120
Starboard aft thruster.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.770
You used the asteroid's
gravitation as a slingshot.

42:39.570 --> 42:40.770
Excellent!

42:45.610 --> 42:47.550
We're out. We got through.

42:48.050 --> 42:50.080
You have the con, Mr Crusher.

42:51.580 --> 42:52.920
Yes, sir.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.120
Full restart.
All systems back on line.

42:55.290 --> 42:57.760
- With pleasure, sir.
- Number One.

42:58.360 --> 43:01.360
Make sure that booby trap
doesn't bother anyone again.

43:01.530 --> 43:03.930
Mr Worf, ready photon torpedoes.

43:04.100 --> 43:07.260
Set to detonate on impact
with the Promellian vessel.

43:07.430 --> 43:08.800
Aye, sir.

43:15.240 --> 43:18.880
I've always thought technology
could solve almost any problem.

43:19.940 --> 43:22.410
It enhances the quality of our lives.

43:23.410 --> 43:27.420
Lets us travel across the galaxy.
Even gave me my vision.

43:28.490 --> 43:32.060
But sometimes
you just have to turn it all off.

43:32.590 --> 43:34.460
Even the gypsy violins.

43:35.660 --> 43:36.830
Violins?

43:38.430 --> 43:39.800
Different program.

43:46.100 --> 43:47.610
We made a good team.

43:49.610 --> 43:51.240
Maybe we can again.

43:54.410 --> 43:56.450
I'm with you every day, Geordi.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.980
Every time you look at this engine.

44:01.250 --> 44:03.750
Every time you touch it, it's me.

44:24.180 --> 44:27.210
Computer, exit holodeck.

44:28.810 --> 44:30.250
End program.
