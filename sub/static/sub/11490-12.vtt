00:01.478 --> 00:04.774
Allright, Mrs. Freemantle we will see you next week.

00:04.794 --> 00:07.111
Oh, thank you, Dr. Harper.

00:07.131 --> 00:10.217
And remember,no more rough sex.

00:11.036 --> 00:14.193
Oh, Dr. Harper, you're terrible.

00:15.811 --> 00:18.478
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:20.196 --> 00:22.733
I wish I was kidding;
the woman's a freak.

00:24.141 --> 00:26.638
You are so good with
the patients, Dr. Harper.

00:26.658 --> 00:27.387
Oh, thank you.

00:27.407 --> 00:30.503
Just you're
- you're warm and personable and funny.

00:30.553 --> 00:32.411
Oh, I'm all right.

00:32.421 --> 00:34.269
But you, the patients love you.

00:34.299 --> 00:36.197
- No.
- Uh, don't give me "no."

00:36.207 --> 00:38.554
- I'm giving you "no."
- Well, I'm not taking "no."

00:39.713 --> 00:41.670
- Don't make me blush.
- I'm making you blush.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.468
Well, I'm blushing.

00:46.754 --> 00:48.223
So we all done for the day?

00:48.233 --> 00:51.559
Yeppers. Mrs. Freemantle
was our last patient.

00:51.569 --> 00:54.995
Okay, then, uh, I will see
your smiling face tomorrow.

00:55.004 --> 00:58.480
Well, it's only smiling
'cause it's looking at you.

00:59.719 --> 01:00.808
Don't make me blush.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.624
- Well, I'm making you blush.
- Well, I'm blushing.

01:21.134 --> 01:23.001
I'm so sorry.

01:23.011 --> 01:24.110
I should apologize.

01:24.130 --> 01:25.598
No, I'm the one who
stepped over the line.

01:25.608 --> 01:26.677
No, no, I stepped, too.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.065
- No, no, I stepped first.
- No, no, no.

01:28.075 --> 01:30.233
Don't give me "no, no."

01:30.243 --> 01:32.500
I'm giving you "no, no."

01:44.436 --> 01:45.575
We can't do this.

01:45.595 --> 01:47.672
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

01:47.682 --> 01:50.089
I ache for you.

01:50.099 --> 01:54.125
Yeah, well, I'm not all that
comfortable right now either.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.035
- It-it-it's just that I feel
like... - You don't have to explain.

02:02.904 --> 02:05.012
I understand.

02:05.361 --> 02:10.705
Okay. Okay. Well, then, uh, I
guess I will see you tomorrow.

02:13.022 --> 02:16.408
I'll be here at, uh, 7:30.

02:16.748 --> 02:19.684
In case you want to get in early.

02:22.651 --> 02:27.975
Oh, okay. Uh, I-I might
actually want to... get in early.

02:29.223 --> 02:34.307
You're the boss. You can
get in anytime you want.

02:38.752 --> 02:40.919
Oh, God.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.567
Mind if I watch the game?

03:16.587 --> 03:19.763
Uh, actually, I came in
here for a little quiet time.

03:26.086 --> 03:29.412
Still quieter than sleeping
under the Santa Monica Pier.

03:34.476 --> 03:35.585
I'm conflicted, Charlie.

03:35.615 --> 03:38.601
Shh, quiet time.

03:43.585 --> 03:46.172
Do you think you can
choose who you love?

03:46.592 --> 03:48.789
Oh, boy.

03:50.847 --> 03:53.314
What's his name?

03:54.992 --> 03:56.889
What? No!

03:56.899 --> 04:00.166
Oh, all right. Come
out when you're ready.

04:04.790 --> 04:06.928
Do you remember my receptionist?

04:06.957 --> 04:10.134
The itsy bitsy spider who
climbed up my water spout?

04:11.782 --> 04:13.929
Yeah. Whatever happened to her?

04:13.939 --> 04:17.785
You dumped her after one depraved
weekend, and I had to give her a raise,

04:17.815 --> 04:20.940
health insurance and a paid
vacation to keep her from quitting.

04:20.961 --> 04:24.417
Oh, good. Thanks for
smoothing that over for me.

04:25.286 --> 04:27.883
Hey, you think she has
plans for this weekend?

04:27.913 --> 04:29.271
What is wrong with you?

04:29.291 --> 04:32.837
Uh, I am trying to tell you that I'm
starting to have feelings for her.

04:32.867 --> 04:34.954
For who?

04:34.964 --> 04:36.782
For Melissa.

04:36.802 --> 04:38.480
Who's Melissa?

04:38.490 --> 04:41.047
My receptionist!

04:43.354 --> 04:45.822
So I should forget about this weekend?

04:45.842 --> 04:48.558
Yes, you should forget
about this weekend!

04:48.568 --> 04:51.964
I was just asking. You don't
have to bite my head off.

04:52.454 --> 04:53.942
So you and her are, uh...

04:53.962 --> 04:56.449
Oh, no, no, no, nothing's happened yet.

04:56.469 --> 04:59.236
Just a little kissing,
and she could feel my...

04:59.266 --> 05:01.473
enthusiasm.

05:01.883 --> 05:05.029
What, are you Noel
Coward? Just say "boner."

05:12.180 --> 05:15.007
Why do I bother talking to you?

05:15.047 --> 05:17.684
Beats the hell out of me.

05:18.383 --> 05:21.290
The thing is, Melissa and
I have-have this chemistry,

05:21.330 --> 05:23.407
and it's really hard not to act on it.

05:23.437 --> 05:25.435
Yeah, it's tough when you work together.

05:25.445 --> 05:26.943
Right.

05:26.973 --> 05:29.490
- You don't crap where you eat.
- I know.

05:30.159 --> 05:32.906
You don't dip your pen in company ink.

05:33.815 --> 05:37.031
And you never bang a woman
who owns a snake or a bird.

05:39.358 --> 05:40.367
What?

05:40.397 --> 05:42.804
They're usually nuts.

05:44.033 --> 05:47.628
So what you're faced with
here is a moral dilemma.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.677
Oh, I'll say.

05:48.697 --> 05:51.724
Whether or not to have an intimate relationship
with a woman who is also your employee.

05:51.744 --> 05:53.891
Exactly.

05:56.068 --> 05:58.226
- I got it, I got it.
- Oh, you do?

05:59.345 --> 06:02.081
Fire her, then boink her.

06:04.249 --> 06:06.956
I don't got it?

06:07.185 --> 06:09.682
You don't got it.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.323
I'm right about the
snakes and birds though.

06:22.078 --> 06:24.894
Really? The one who works for him?

06:24.904 --> 06:25.604
Yep.

06:25.623 --> 06:28.041
Tinkerbell with the knockers?

06:30.178 --> 06:32.016
The same.

06:32.026 --> 06:35.112
Well, everybody makes that mistake once.

06:35.132 --> 06:40.126
I crossed that line in the '70s when I
was cleaning house for Mr. Telly Savalas.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.303
No kidding. TV's Kojak?

06:43.313 --> 06:44.911
One and the same.

06:44.931 --> 06:46.229
What happened?

06:46.249 --> 06:49.126
What do you think happened?
He's Greek, a man of passion.

06:49.136 --> 06:52.022
You can't tie your
shoes around those guys.

06:56.857 --> 06:57.905
That's rough.

06:57.925 --> 07:00.322
Bet your ass it's rough.

07:03.209 --> 07:05.137
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:05.147 --> 07:09.871
So, Zippy, I hear you've been sinking
your putts on the company golf course.

07:13.926 --> 07:15.455
Thanks for telling her.

07:15.485 --> 07:17.232
Thanks for telling me.

07:18.281 --> 07:22.696
Word of advice: it may seem like
fun and games at the beginning,

07:22.716 --> 07:26.751
but mark my words, sooner or later,
you're gonna wake up with a broken heart

07:26.781 --> 07:29.878
and a lollipop stuck to your keister.

07:37.229 --> 07:38.867
You want to explain that to me?

07:38.897 --> 07:41.304
I'd rather forget I ever heard it.

07:42.293 --> 07:44.920
So, decide what you're
gonna do about Melissa?

07:44.940 --> 07:45.859
There's nothing to do.

07:45.879 --> 07:48.535
I have to take the physical
feelings I have for her

07:48.575 --> 07:53.270
and channel them into something creative,
productive, something, something that'll last.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.656
You're gonna have sex with the
vacuum cleaner again, aren't you?

07:58.444 --> 08:01.470
That wasn't sex, that was an accident.

08:02.359 --> 08:05.316
Once is an accident.

08:16.852 --> 08:17.801
Morning, Melissa.

08:17.811 --> 08:20.068
Good morning, Dr. Harper.

08:20.078 --> 08:21.736
How's my schedule look today?

08:21.746 --> 08:24.213
It's packed pretty tight.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.970
Oh, okay. Uh, tight's good.

08:27.230 --> 08:30.995
You know, better-better
tight than, uh, you know...

08:31.005 --> 08:33.542
Thank God for scoliosis.

08:35.070 --> 08:40.674
Um, listen, Melissa, um, about
what happened yesterday...

08:40.683 --> 08:43.061
Please, Dr. Harper, you
don't have to say anything.

08:43.081 --> 08:45.438
Yes, yes, I do.

08:45.448 --> 08:48.744
We obviously have feelings
for each other, and...

08:49.304 --> 08:53.259
there's nothing wrong with that. It's-it's
a beautiful thing. It's-it's natural.

08:53.998 --> 08:59.032
But for us to maintain a-a working
relationship, and I hope friendship,

08:59.062 --> 09:04.556
I-I think it would be unwise
to succumb to those feelings.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.453
I agree.

09:06.493 --> 09:08.830
Oh, good, good. I'm glad.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.527
Oh, well, now we got
that out of the way...

09:11.567 --> 09:13.845
Uh, what time does my
packed schedule begin?

09:13.875 --> 09:16.851
Uh, not for a half hour.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.708
Half hour?

09:19.718 --> 09:21.895
Yeppers.

09:23.353 --> 09:24.822
Nothing for a half hour?

09:24.842 --> 09:26.819
Wide open.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.578
Everything work out at the office?

09:38.735 --> 09:42.341
Manage to keep your hands
off Really Little Annie Fanny?

09:43.509 --> 09:48.234
Well, not exactly, but, uh,
we did keep it above the waist.

09:48.244 --> 09:50.991
Her waist or yours?

09:51.949 --> 09:54.796
Both. And it wasn't easy.

09:54.806 --> 09:59.890
I haven't checked, but I'm pretty sure my balls
look like two-thirds of the Blue Man Group.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.830
Berta, hide the vacuum cleaner!

10:10.817 --> 10:16.011
For the last time, I use it
to get lint off my trousers.

10:18.178 --> 10:21.155
Then why do you call it Brenda?

10:26.119 --> 10:31.013
So when the mood strikes and
she's ready, you'll be ready, too.

10:31.023 --> 10:35.967
Ready today, ready
tonight, ready tomorrow.

10:36.617 --> 10:39.234
I'm ready now.

10:42.010 --> 10:44.108
What's he ready for?

10:44.138 --> 10:48.602
If I were to guess, I'd say he's ready
to screw up his life a little more.

10:49.362 --> 10:52.538
Is that even possible?

10:52.867 --> 10:55.215
We'll see.

10:55.804 --> 10:58.341
I'm hungry.

10:58.371 --> 10:59.649
So eat something.

10:59.669 --> 11:02.386
There's nothing here I like.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.803
Welcome to my world.

11:15.051 --> 11:17.388
So why are we eating here?

11:17.398 --> 11:20.695
I have to watch you stuff your face,
and I gonna get a drink

11:23.951 --> 11:25.769
Am I even allowed to be in a bar?

11:25.789 --> 11:29.804
Probably not. So if anybody
asks, you're a homely lesbian.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.861
Why do I have to be homely?

11:31.871 --> 11:34.298
Just sit down.

11:36.336 --> 11:38.454
What's that smell?

11:38.464 --> 11:42.499
Stale beer, vomit, urine. You hungry?

11:43.168 --> 11:46.124
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi, Janine. This is my nephew Jake.

11:46.134 --> 11:48.681
Hey, Jake. How old are you, sweetheart?

11:48.691 --> 11:51.608
Keep your hands off him,
Janine, he's married.

11:51.618 --> 11:54.295
I thought I was a lesbian.

11:54.415 --> 11:57.381
We're just gonna have a couple of
hamburgers and a basket of fries,

11:57.421 --> 11:58.949
he'll have a soda and I'll have a draft.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.926
That's not a very healthy
dinner for a growing boy.

12:01.936 --> 12:04.053
Well, don't worry, he
can process anything.

12:04.083 --> 12:07.180
The other day, he ate a
handful of packing peanuts.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.808
You bet me ten bucks I wouldn't.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.845
Oh, Charlie, shame on you.

12:10.865 --> 12:13.552
Yeah, shame on you.

12:14.681 --> 12:17.208
Tell you what, Jake, I get
out of here in ten minutes.

12:17.218 --> 12:19.315
Why don't you get your uncle
to bring you over to my place,

12:19.335 --> 12:21.882
and I'll cook you a
nice, healthy dinner?

12:21.892 --> 12:25.288
Thanks, but I'm already
healthy. I'll have a hamburger.

12:25.498 --> 12:28.394
No, you won't. We'll be there.

12:28.404 --> 12:29.883
I don't get a vote?

12:29.893 --> 12:32.749
You're lucky you're getting
dinner. Thanks, Janine.

12:32.759 --> 12:34.977
You're welcome.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.611
What is wrong with
you, turning that down?

12:39.621 --> 12:43.417
Excuse me, but we have no
idea what kind of cook she is.

12:43.766 --> 12:45.275
Oh, God...

12:45.304 --> 12:48.950
For all we know, she's a vegetarian.

12:52.496 --> 12:54.354
Dr. Harper, what are you doing here?

12:54.364 --> 12:55.762
What do you think I'm doing here?

12:55.772 --> 12:57.300
Please don't make me guess.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.727
I'm making you guess.

13:07.189 --> 13:09.126
Correct.

13:09.905 --> 13:11.583
Melissa, honey, who's here?

13:11.603 --> 13:15.988
Uh, Mom, this is my boss, Dr. Harper.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.582
Dr. Harper, this is my mother.

13:21.641 --> 13:24.718
- Hello.
- Hello yourself.

13:24.728 --> 13:29.272
I understand there's been some
inappropriate behavior in the workplace.

13:30.641 --> 13:35.225
Yeah, well, about that, I-I-I just want you to know
that I have nothing but respect for your daughter,

13:35.245 --> 13:37.053
and I would never do anything...

13:37.063 --> 13:40.240
I'm just yankin' your chain!

13:40.249 --> 13:42.926
Ain't nothin' wrong
with beddin' the boss.

13:42.956 --> 13:48.550
That's how I wound up with the little
princess here and half a Black Angus franchise.

13:49.209 --> 13:52.405
Come on in. I'm watchin' Hellboy.

13:54.153 --> 13:56.051
Okay. Thanks.

13:57.199 --> 13:59.467
You smoke dope?

14:03.342 --> 14:05.040
This is, like, the best dinner ever.

14:05.090 --> 14:06.349
I'm glad you liked it, Jake.

14:06.369 --> 14:07.717
You are a great cook.

14:07.747 --> 14:12.831
And you are a cutie pie.
I could just eat you up.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.108
- Want another root beer?
- Sure.

14:15.118 --> 14:17.126
Comin' right up.

14:22.490 --> 14:24.787
Listen, buddy, you're gonna
have to make yourself scarce.

14:24.807 --> 14:26.325
Maybe take a cab home.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.082
You take a cab home. I'm doin' great.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.908
How do you figure?

14:31.938 --> 14:35.944
You blind? First base on the top
of my head, second base in my ear?

14:36.912 --> 14:38.051
Listen to me, knucklehead.

14:38.081 --> 14:39.909
That woman's got to be
ten years older than you.

14:39.939 --> 14:43.385
So? You're, like, 15
years older than her.

14:44.713 --> 14:47.460
Step aside, grandpa.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.885
Okay, fun time's over.
Go wait in the car.

14:51.895 --> 14:53.043
You go wait in the car.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.520
- No, you go.
- No, you go.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.755
Jake, how about I put some ice cream
in that root beer and make it a float?

14:59.765 --> 15:01.933
Thank you. That'd be great.

15:02.992 --> 15:05.658
It's like she can read my mind.

15:06.208 --> 15:09.264
Go get in the car.

15:09.294 --> 15:12.191
Fine, I'll just go tell Janine that
you want me to wait in the car by myself

15:12.201 --> 15:15.057
so you can try and have sex with her.

15:17.355 --> 15:20.381
Sit down, you little bastard.

15:21.580 --> 15:25.944
Now, this picture here is
toward the end of my labor.

15:27.293 --> 15:30.349
That's my vagina,

15:30.799 --> 15:35.963
and that's Melissa's little head
pokin' out of me like a groundhog.

15:37.790 --> 15:42.944
Hey, I guess if she'd seen her shadow, I
would've had six more weeks of labor, huh?

15:44.742 --> 15:46.810
It's funny.

15:47.289 --> 15:50.465
You know, of all my
kids, she was the easiest.

15:50.495 --> 15:53.901
Just like popping out a ping-pong ball.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.428
That's quite an image.

15:56.438 --> 15:59.475
Yeah, oh, and it was a
natural childbirth, too.

15:59.505 --> 16:04.659
No drugs, just a couple of peyote
buttons and bitin' down on a rope.

16:06.197 --> 16:10.372
Mom, would you mind if Dr. Harper
and I have a little time alone?

16:10.382 --> 16:11.610
I'm sorry, honey.

16:11.620 --> 16:16.355
You kids must be as horny as
a couple of drunken rabbits.

16:16.914 --> 16:19.072
Enjoy.

16:19.941 --> 16:25.864
Oh, uh, Kama Sutra's on the bookshelf
case you feel like pushin' the envelope.

16:28.091 --> 16:29.869
I'm sorry about that.

16:29.899 --> 16:33.125
Mom never really made
it home from Woodstock.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.392
Don't be silly. She's delightful.

16:36.012 --> 16:38.509
I'm just gonna close this up now.

16:45.780 --> 16:48.077
Don't mind me.

16:48.637 --> 16:53.431
I'm just gonna a roll a fatty in the
backyard and zone out in the hammock.

16:59.434 --> 17:00.962
Ah, that hit the spot.

17:00.992 --> 17:02.370
I'm glad you liked it.

17:02.390 --> 17:05.715
The best part of a root beer
float? Your burps taste good.

17:09.022 --> 17:11.020
Listen, Janine, thanks for everything,

17:11.030 --> 17:14.037
but I should probably get this
little guy home and come back.

17:14.047 --> 17:16.314
It's way past his bedtime.

17:16.324 --> 17:19.430
What are you talking about?
It's not past my bedtime.

17:19.440 --> 17:23.785
What do you wanna bet he falls asleep
in the car and I have to carry him in?

17:24.145 --> 17:28.659
What do you wanna bet he has to go home and take
a laxative because he's too old to poop normal?

17:31.416 --> 17:34.762
- All right, that's it!
- Not in the face! Not in the face!

17:35.501 --> 17:39.157
What? Stop that! He's
kidding. I never hit him.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.555
Jake, tell her you're kidding.

17:40.565 --> 17:44.041
I'm kidding about that, but
he can be verbally abusive.

17:44.870 --> 17:46.009
Not funny, Jake.

17:46.019 --> 17:48.476
The liquor makes him mean.

17:48.486 --> 17:50.843
Okay, I didn't want to have to do this,

17:50.863 --> 17:53.510
but I am calling your
father, let him deal with you.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.307
I'm gonna go straighten
up in the kitchen.

17:58.924 --> 18:00.991
You don't know who you're messing with.

18:01.011 --> 18:04.797
Are you kidding? I think she's gorgeous!

18:12.408 --> 18:15.544
You don't know who you're messin' with.

18:26.711 --> 18:29.617
I'm sorry about that. Hang on.

18:34.372 --> 18:36.909
Charlie, now is not a good time.

18:37.198 --> 18:38.806
All right, put him on.

18:38.816 --> 18:42.322
I can't talk now, Dad. I'm about
to get lucky with an older woman.

18:43.221 --> 18:47.416
What? Where are you? Jake? Jake?

18:52.490 --> 18:58.613
Alan, would you be totally weirded out
by a little mother-daughter tag team?

19:12.337 --> 19:14.304
I hope you're happy.

19:14.664 --> 19:16.732
I hope you'rehappy.

19:16.752 --> 19:19.368
I could've been happy.

19:19.378 --> 19:21.506
u gonna tell me what happened tonight?

19:21.516 --> 19:23.563
You don't wanna know.

19:24.183 --> 19:25.971
Where are you going?

19:25.981 --> 19:28.208
I'm a 14-year-old boy
who recently got ear-boob.

19:28.218 --> 19:30.525
Where do you think I'm going?

19:31.964 --> 19:33.701
Ear-boob?

19:33.711 --> 19:36.099
You don't wanna know.

19:36.119 --> 19:37.527
So how'd it go with Melissa?

19:37.547 --> 19:39.664
You don't wanna know.

19:39.674 --> 19:41.442
Oh, come on.

19:41.462 --> 19:45.707
All right. I met her mom,saw
a photo of mom's vagina,

19:45.737 --> 19:49.293
and chose to leave before being
introduced to the real thing.

19:51.830 --> 19:54.667
You're right,I didn't wanna know.

19:56.015 --> 19:57.134
Where are you going?

19:57.144 --> 19:59.970
I'm a 40-year-old
guy who recently...

19:59.990 --> 20:02.937
Ah, screw it.I'm gonna
go play with myself.

20:03.806 --> 20:06.682
Okay,thatI didn't want to know.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.728
Still not a bad idea.
