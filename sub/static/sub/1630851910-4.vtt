WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:09.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:25.520 --> 00:27.040
Observations.

00:27.560 --> 00:33.040
The victim is in an advanced state

00:33.120 --> 00:35.320
of decomposition.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.760
Cause of death

00:38.720 --> 00:40.240
undetermined.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.040
I can't ask more questions
without raising suspicion.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.760
Good morning.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.440
The circumstances surrounding
the appearance of the corpse are odd.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.000
The Americans are nervous.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.040
I think PIDE should investigate.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.880
I will take the necessary measures.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.120
Okay. Do you need me to do anything else?

03:05.200 --> 03:08.040
We will continue this conversation later.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.200
-I have to go.
-Sure.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.120
Minister, sir.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.760
I need you to come with me
to the Red Cross Hospital.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.880
What happened?

03:25.400 --> 03:28.360
Prof. Oliveira Salazar is in the hospital.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.160
Did you see the corpse?

04:04.280 --> 04:08.840
No. They say that it was unrecognizable
because it was in the water for so long.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.520
So, who was living
in the house by the dam?

04:14.760 --> 04:18.320
And how was her relationship
with the Americans?

04:18.840 --> 04:20.960
Did they ever question her loyalty?

04:21.560 --> 04:22.640
I don't know.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.360
We have to go back to the house
by the dam and find out who was there.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.960
In the meantime,
I'll ask the doctor how she died.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.240
And find out what the Americans know.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.360
Hey, that's enough.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.000
It's a commemorative bottle.
Ten years at RARET.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.080
They gave you a bottle too?

05:26.160 --> 05:29.520
No, they only give it to the directors.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.720
-It must be good, then.
-Ten years? Twelve would be good.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.880
How did she die?

07:10.840 --> 07:11.880
She drowned.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.720
She drowned?

07:14.520 --> 07:18.920
Didn't she have her clothes on?
I was told she was found dressed.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.440
What do you think happened, Miguel?

07:22.120 --> 07:25.480
Was it an accident, did she kill herself,
or did someone kill her?

07:26.120 --> 07:28.280
I just determine the cause of death.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.360
And hers was… an accident.
Do you have a cigarette?

07:35.240 --> 07:37.280
Ramiro, do you have a cigarette?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.000
I'm going to the bathroom.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.560
Miguel is not telling us everything.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.880
But I'll go see him tomorrow.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.800
Elias told me
that the military police are on alert.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.480
They seem to think
that the locals are going to protest.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.640
We only have to report on what goes on
at RARET with the Americans.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.960
The military police do the rest.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.400
Got it.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.800
I'm getting ice. Do you want some?

08:12.320 --> 08:13.760
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.000
The dessert you brought was fantastic.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.960
It's the only thing I can make.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.440
You said you know Mia from Lisbon?

08:53.160 --> 08:57.880
We had many mutual friends,
and we went out a couple of times,

08:58.640 --> 08:59.800
just the two of us.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.480
Mia never told us about you.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.240
-Did you know her well?
-Sofia?

09:15.240 --> 09:18.800
-We were just talking.
-It's late. Let's go home.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.720
Next, we have song number five.

09:43.240 --> 09:47.520
It's called "Verão."
The singer is Carlos Mendes.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.720
Let me out!

10:20.440 --> 10:23.600
Open the door, please!

10:24.440 --> 10:26.680
I can't stand
being locked in here, Ramiro!

10:26.760 --> 10:30.080
Open the door, please!

10:30.720 --> 10:31.920
Open!

10:33.000 --> 10:34.360
Open the door!

10:41.600 --> 10:43.600
Open the door…

10:45.600 --> 10:48.960
Let me out!

10:49.600 --> 10:51.920
Let me out of here!

10:52.960 --> 10:54.160
Open it!

10:56.000 --> 10:58.280
Take this time to think
about your behavior.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.120
Open the door, Ramiro!

11:01.200 --> 11:04.560
I can't stand
being locked in here! Open it!

11:09.760 --> 11:12.760
Open the door, Ramiro! Open the door!

11:14.160 --> 11:18.400
Let me out! I can't stand
being locked in here! Open the door!

12:15.400 --> 12:19.080
The President of the Council,
Prof. Oliveira Salazar,

12:19.160 --> 12:22.520
was admitted
to the Portuguese Red Cross Hospital,

12:22.600 --> 12:26.400
where he underwent surgery
as a result of a--

12:34.000 --> 12:36.240
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.480
I know you don't like cars,

12:38.560 --> 12:41.360
but it's way too hot
to walk there the whole way.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.920
I'm used to it.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.520
Where are you working today?

12:46.080 --> 12:47.600
Close to Vala de Magos.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.440
Would you like a ride?
I'm going in that direction.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.520
-It's not necessary.
-Come on.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.560
We'll be there in no time.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.120
Okay. But drop me off at the crossroads.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.560
I don't want them to see me coming
by car, or else the gossip will start.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.840
Thank you.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.840
Every time I go to the cafeteria,
I hope that you've returned to RARET.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.200
That's life.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.480
Everyone has their place in this world.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.480
I know you have dreams.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.720
You said you'd like to see the ocean.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.160
I will, one day.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.480
Why not now?

13:34.800 --> 13:36.680
-Now?
-Yes.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.400
I can't just skip work.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.800
We'll think of an excuse later.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.720
The ocean is so far.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.000
Don't worry. I won't insist.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.280
It was just an idea.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.000
We'd be back by mid-afternoon.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.600
Okay. Let's go.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.520
I want to see the ocean.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.400
It's so big!

15:03.280 --> 15:04.760
Would you like to get your feet wet?

15:05.400 --> 15:06.320
Can we?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.760
-Sure.
-Isn't it dangerous?

15:11.120 --> 15:12.040
No.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.600
Come on.

15:32.080 --> 15:32.920
Oh!

15:35.800 --> 15:37.000
It's so cold!

15:52.480 --> 15:54.320
And it really is salty!

16:02.120 --> 16:03.160
Careful!

16:51.840 --> 16:53.720
You know I'm getting married.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.520
Is that what you want?

16:59.160 --> 17:00.480
It's what's going to happen.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.320
I should have never come with you.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.360
But I'm glad you did.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.800
You don't have to always do
what others expect of you.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.240
Miguel, we swam together in the dam.
I saw her swim lots of times.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.560
She swam very well.
It doesn't make any sense.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.640
What doesn't make sense
is that she was killed.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.200
There was nothing to steal at the house.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.280
She was just a telegrapher at RARET.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.120
You know what happened?

18:16.200 --> 18:18.560
She probably slipped,
hit her head, and drowned.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.320
Do you have a lighter?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.040
Here.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.640
She said goodbye to me.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.880
She said goodbye to me.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.920
Do you think she killed herself?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.760
Just let it go, Gonçalo.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.440
Before long,
she won't even get a decent burial.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.400
You know what priests are like.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.320
Sometimes I wonder,
maybe I could have somehow…

18:46.840 --> 18:50.040
Is there something I could have done?
Could I have talked to her?

18:50.120 --> 18:52.600
-Tried to understand what--
-It was an accident.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.960
That's the best version for everybody.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.400
James doesn't want the police
at RARET asking questions.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.080
The official version
is the one I told you.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.680
I see, the official version.
And then there's the other version--

19:06.760 --> 19:09.920
Don't start with your theories.
James doesn't want PIDE snooping around.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.880
Understood.

19:17.080 --> 19:22.240
How is Prof. Salazar?
Will he be okay? Is there any news?

19:24.120 --> 19:25.600
Only the official news.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.080
He's recovering well.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.360
Do you think if he…

19:32.760 --> 19:34.320
if something happens…

19:35.840 --> 19:37.160
what happens to the regime?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.400
Whoever was here didn't come back.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.840
And I doubt they will.
Now that Mia's corpse has been found.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.920
Gonçalo told me that these bottles
are only given to directors.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.120
In that case,
the list of suspects just got shorter.

20:26.040 --> 20:30.120
You just need to find out
who still has their bottles at home.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.440
Good evening.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.480
Want to tell me where you've been all day?

20:39.320 --> 20:44.000
On my way to the field, I saw Ermelinda,
and she asked me to look after her mother.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.680
She woke up in pain.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.080
Couldn't even get out of bed.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.160
An aerogram arrived from Fernando.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.520
"My dear Carolina,

21:07.120 --> 21:09.480
I hope this letter finds you well."

21:10.000 --> 21:12.520
"The days here pass slowly,

21:12.600 --> 21:15.200
and my longing for home
only increases with time."

21:15.720 --> 21:19.360
"Knowing that we're getting married
is what keeps me alive."

21:19.440 --> 21:23.040
"I miss you so much. Yours, Fernando."

21:23.920 --> 21:25.720
"Tell my parents that I'm fine."

21:36.200 --> 21:38.120
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

21:52.120 --> 21:57.320
OFFICE
JAMES WILSON

21:57.400 --> 22:00.480
-They confirmed it was a hemorrhage.
-So what's the current status?

22:00.560 --> 22:04.880
We don't know, but if it's serious,
I doubt that they would tell us.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.240
We offered the services
of a New York neurologist,

22:08.320 --> 22:10.160
but I hope they don't accept it,

22:10.240 --> 22:12.800
because if he dies,
I certainly don't want us involved.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.800
Yeah, and the pieces
will start to move swiftly.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.200
May I?

27:19.720 --> 27:20.800
Here you go.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.160
I'll walk you out.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.640
I have to go
to the bathroom to wash my hands.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.760
Go ahead.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.200
Be careful.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.720
I heard that the military police have
orders to move in if you try to protest.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.600
Don't worry.
We know how to deal with them.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.800
Does it say something
about the start of the championship?

28:24.120 --> 28:27.800
As long as we have the Black Panther,
Sporting don't stand a chance.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.800
Even the rebels in Africa
stop fighting to listen to the games.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.240
Is that true, João?

28:35.760 --> 28:38.840
I heard that our troops
turn the speakers towards the jungle,

28:38.920 --> 28:41.040
and even the rebels shout, "Goal!"

28:41.560 --> 28:43.760
No. Those are just made-up stories.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.200
I have to go freshen up.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.600
Go take a nap.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.920
Go take a nap. We'll keep an eye on this.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.080
I just need to have some water.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.000
Everything is fine with the baby.

30:10.080 --> 30:14.120
Don't worry. And in a little while,
you will start showing.

30:15.600 --> 30:20.360
I'll talk to my husband
when it starts showing. Not before.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.520
Listen, Sofia,
I understand you feel unsure,

30:24.600 --> 30:28.160
but I'm sure Ramiro
will be very happy with this news.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.320
Doctor, I…

30:31.240 --> 30:32.960
I'm afraid that

30:33.960 --> 30:35.920
Ramiro won't accept her if it's a girl--

30:36.000 --> 30:37.320
Nonsense.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.720
Is that why you don't want to tell him?

30:43.520 --> 30:46.120
Maybe there is no reason to be worried.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.280
But Ramiro
always talked about having a boy.

30:53.240 --> 30:56.080
Don't worry, I won't say a thing. Okay?

31:02.200 --> 31:05.360
I want you to check everything
to see if there is any interference.

31:05.880 --> 31:09.200
-Of course, sir. We know.
-I'll be right back.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.200
He's going for lunch, and we stay here.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.400
Great.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.960
I went back to Mia's house by the dam.

31:23.040 --> 31:26.360
I found a bottle just like the one
we drank at James's house.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.240
Did Ramiro get one too?

31:29.320 --> 31:31.680
Do you think she was involved with Ramiro?

31:32.200 --> 31:34.200
You told me that it was someone here.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.960
Mia and that asshole Ramiro?

31:36.600 --> 31:38.840
Go on, try to play some music.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.160
Maybe he was the one who killed her.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.560
No, Ramiro wasn't here.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.360
He was training in Germany
when she disappeared.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.320
Are you sure?

32:10.400 --> 32:12.920
I am. I helped carry
his suitcases to the car.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.640
This doesn't sound right.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.440
It could also have been James…

32:33.560 --> 32:34.840
I spoke to Miguel.

32:37.120 --> 32:42.040
Miguel told me that James
asked him to falsify the autopsy report.

32:42.120 --> 32:45.080
His excuse was he didn't want
the police snooping around RARET.

32:45.160 --> 32:46.600
-That makes sense.
-It does.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.920
Or maybe it doesn't and she killed herself
and we're running in circles.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.960
Open the door, Quim!

32:57.160 --> 32:59.840
Quim! Open the door!

33:08.000 --> 33:08.840
Come here!

33:13.080 --> 33:13.960
Come on!

33:14.040 --> 33:15.960
To the station!

33:16.640 --> 33:17.880
I called Lisbon.

33:19.400 --> 33:22.720
I told them about the Commies
trying to recruit the local people.

33:26.440 --> 33:30.720
Mary's name

33:31.400 --> 33:35.760
It's so beautiful

33:35.840 --> 33:40.560
Save my soul

33:41.480 --> 33:46.440
My soul is yours

33:47.280 --> 33:52.520
My soul is yours

33:53.040 --> 33:57.600
My soul is or will be yours

33:57.680 --> 34:02.480
Save my soul

34:03.080 --> 34:07.040
When I die…

34:07.120 --> 34:09.400
Quim was taken to the police station.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.680
We have to do something
before PIDE comes for him.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.480
I'll take care of it.

34:15.560 --> 34:19.200
When I am gone

34:19.280 --> 34:23.880
Save my soul

34:24.400 --> 34:29.960
Take it somewhere good

34:30.600 --> 34:35.520
Take it somewhere good

34:36.200 --> 34:40.200
Take it to heaven

34:40.280 --> 34:45.160
Save my soul

34:45.880 --> 34:51.040
Judgment Day

34:51.720 --> 34:56.640
Judgment Day

35:11.760 --> 35:13.120
Sir?

35:15.440 --> 35:17.120
Maybe you shouldn't drive.

35:19.400 --> 35:20.560
I'm fine.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.440
Are you okay, sir?

35:50.120 --> 35:52.280
Elias, I didn't see the sign.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.000
It's late, and with all the celebrations…

35:55.680 --> 35:57.400
I thought the curve was right here.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.360
What you need is to sleep it off, sir.

36:00.440 --> 36:01.280
Come on.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.680
You'd better come with me.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.440
I'll take you to Casa do Povo.
You can play some cards.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.280
No, I don't want to be seen like this.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.760
I'll get in big trouble
if the director finds out.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.600
Nothing to see here!
Go back to the celebrations!

36:22.680 --> 36:26.280
I'd rather wait at the station
until I feel better if you don't mind.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.080
I'll take you there.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.120
Come on, careful with your head.

36:51.480 --> 36:52.640
What happened?

36:52.720 --> 36:55.080
He's feeling unwell.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.320
He's gonna rest here for an hour or two.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.600
Of course. Sit down, sir.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.600
Don't worry about me.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.320
I just need to close my eyes
for a moment and…

37:07.400 --> 37:09.240
He hit the sign in the town square.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.880
…I'll be right as rain.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.840
You'd better fill out a form for that.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.680
What did he hit?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.520
You left the celebrations early.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.720
Did something happen?

37:35.160 --> 37:38.320
I heard you skipped work
to drive around in a car with some man.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.520
Who is he?

37:45.280 --> 37:46.120
Dad…

37:48.960 --> 37:51.680
Who is the bastard?

37:58.040 --> 38:00.360
-Luís, don't do that.
-Shut up!

38:00.960 --> 38:03.120
It's your fault she's so careless!

38:03.200 --> 38:05.520
-Yours and Ermelinda's!
-It's not Ermelinda's fault!

38:05.600 --> 38:07.920
-Who is he?
-Dad!

38:08.000 --> 38:09.240
Leave her alone!

38:20.840 --> 38:21.880
Listen.

38:22.720 --> 38:25.160
Are you on duty tomorrow
during the festivities?

38:27.480 --> 38:31.880
No, only today because of the procession.
I'll be back to RARET tomorrow.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.520
I'll get Parrulas to do the rounds.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.840
-See you tomorrow.
-What about him?

38:41.640 --> 38:43.840
When he wakes up, let him go.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.360
That'll be enough time to rest.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.160
See you tomorrow.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.760
-Parrulas, go do the rounds.
-Yes, sir.

39:21.120 --> 39:24.480
Well? Everybody else has left.
Why am I still here?

39:24.560 --> 39:27.560
PIDE will be here soon to answer that.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.600
Is it morning already?

39:31.440 --> 39:32.480
Sir.

39:34.600 --> 39:35.520
Feeling better?

39:36.320 --> 39:37.280
Yes.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.800
-Where is Officer Elias?
-He just left.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.560
I'll be going home now too.
I just need my keys.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.680
What keys?

39:46.280 --> 39:47.240
My car keys.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.320
Elias has them.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.080
He didn't give me anything. Are you sure?

39:56.360 --> 39:57.280
Yes.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.280
Let me see if we can still catch him.

40:19.640 --> 40:23.360
I don't know where he is.
And I can't leave the station unattended.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.440
Hey, they were in my pocket.

40:30.160 --> 40:33.720
We all know what it's like
to have one too many, right, sir?

41:18.640 --> 41:21.560
The Americans and their friends from RARET

41:22.080 --> 41:26.120
do whatever they want,
and you just bend over.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.880
-Shut up, Quim.
-Am I wrong?

41:29.680 --> 41:31.800
And you look like you would like it.

41:34.080 --> 41:37.320
How does it feel
to bend over for the Americans?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.840
Who do you think you're talking to?

41:43.920 --> 41:45.520
To a homo guard.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.600
Didn't you already get
enough of a beating?

41:47.680 --> 41:51.360
You're very brave when you're together.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.640
Know what they say in the village?

41:53.720 --> 41:56.800
That you also need help
to take care of your wife.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.480
-Homo.
-I'll show you who needs help.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.600
What now, asshole?

42:09.840 --> 42:11.040
-Calm down.
-Don't move!

42:11.120 --> 42:13.120
-Don't move.
-Calm down, Quim. Calm down!

42:13.200 --> 42:14.440
Calm the fuck down!

42:16.480 --> 42:17.680
Calm down.
