Before she asks for it back.

03:46.068 --> 03:47.949

Hey.

04:25.541 --> 04:26.741
Hey.

04:27.636 --> 04:30.140
It was the Governor's
idea not mine. I...

04:32.255 --> 04:34.144
If it has to be anyone,
I'm glad it's you.

04:34.150 --> 04:36.074
Okay.

04:37.852 --> 04:39.153
Is that Red's stuff?

04:39.159 --> 04:40.359
Yeah.

04:41.450 --> 04:44.747
Liz packed it up for me but
I haven't been able to...

04:46.998 --> 04:50.100
Hey, you know how you said
you wanted to help me out?

04:50.389 --> 04:51.589
Yeah.

04:52.685 --> 04:54.491
I got something for you to do.

05:01.229 --> 05:03.816
I've been waiting three days to see ya.

05:03.822 --> 05:05.503
What is it Birdsworth?

05:05.509 --> 05:07.730
I saw Sonia Stevens.

05:08.105 --> 05:10.922
What the bloody hell is
she doing back in here?

05:10.928 --> 05:12.227
She's been remanded...

05:12.233 --> 05:14.715
for the murder of her husband,
they found his remains.

05:14.721 --> 05:16.723
Jesus Christ, another murder.

05:17.827 --> 05:19.811
Well, you can't put
her back into General.

05:19.817 --> 05:22.753
What I can't do is keep her
in a holding cell indefinitely.

05:22.759 --> 05:24.124
Well, you can put her in Protection

05:24.130 --> 05:25.552
and that way she... she can't get at me.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.608
Sonia has to request
to be put in Protection.

05:27.614 --> 05:30.333
She has killed two people
we know of, Ms Bennett,

05:30.339 --> 05:31.539
I don't wanna be next!

05:31.545 --> 05:33.361
If you'd wish you can put
yourself in Protection.

05:33.367 --> 05:37.721
Ha! Right, and that's bloody
obvious then I was Witness X!

05:37.727 --> 05:39.747
Sonia has no idea.

05:39.753 --> 05:42.711
And what happens if she figures it out?

05:42.717 --> 05:45.624
Well, she won't if you stay
calm and stop panicking.

05:46.735 --> 05:48.747
That's so easy for you to say.

05:50.388 --> 05:52.477
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

05:52.483 --> 05:54.670
H Block are now called for lunch.

06:07.051 --> 06:08.925
Liz!

06:08.931 --> 06:12.209
- Oh, where have you been hiding?
- Oh, God... I heard you were back...

06:12.215 --> 06:13.798
What... what happened?

06:13.804 --> 06:16.446
This deranged cop, couldn't
get a conviction for Helen,

06:16.452 --> 06:20.054
so now he's framing me for
the murder of my own husband.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.025
So much for the justice system, eh?

06:23.031 --> 06:24.757
I'm after that detective...

06:24.763 --> 06:27.883
and he shouldn't underestimate my reach.

06:34.790 --> 06:35.990
Oi!

06:35.996 --> 06:38.387
- Oi, I fuckin' saw that!
- Piss off!

06:38.393 --> 06:41.151
- How many fuckin' times, huh?!
- Uh... Hey...

06:41.157 --> 06:43.823
Ya dumb fuck, how many times?!

06:43.829 --> 06:45.925
- Are you gonna listen to me now, uh?
- No! Hey!

06:45.931 --> 06:48.034
- What about now, huh?!
- Hey!

06:48.040 --> 06:49.859
- Huh? Huh? Oh-oh... oh-oh...
- Argh!

06:49.865 --> 06:52.614
- Oh, whoopsie! Whoopsie!
- Oh, my...

06:52.620 --> 06:54.967
- Oi! Jenkins, let her go!
- Friggin' "Argh"?!

06:54.973 --> 06:56.700
- Argh! Argh!
- One more second

06:56.706 --> 06:58.280
and it's the slot. I mean it!

06:59.474 --> 07:00.674
Enough!

07:00.772 --> 07:03.419
- Ah!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

07:04.131 --> 07:05.747
What's the problem here?

07:05.753 --> 07:08.557
No, just bumped into
her, was accident, eh.

07:09.361 --> 07:10.779
Is that right?

07:10.890 --> 07:12.476
Whatever she says.

07:13.944 --> 07:16.061
- Get to lunch. Go on!
- Oh...

07:16.067 --> 07:18.171
yeah, lunch!

07:18.177 --> 07:19.654
Go to lunch.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.857
She is pissed.

07:23.959 --> 07:26.748
- What the fuck?!
- She's fuckin' rinsed.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.359
I know, her breath nearly killed me.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.955
Whatever, she can have
lunch and sleep it off.

07:33.961 --> 07:36.271
- I can't be arsed with the paperwork.
- Wrong...

07:36.563 --> 07:38.333
that was about the business.

07:38.339 --> 07:40.024
She's gonna screw everything.

07:47.142 --> 07:48.710
_

07:51.658 --> 07:53.049
Mate, you got a second?

07:53.632 --> 07:55.018
Yeah, sure, what's up?

07:55.024 --> 07:57.903
Oh, I just had to bounce
Jenkins for a bit of argy-bargy.

07:57.909 --> 07:59.507
Hardly surprising.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.030
Yeah, the thing is, she reeked of booze.

08:02.544 --> 08:04.647
Has she got a history
of brewing lunatic soup?

08:04.653 --> 08:06.216
I thought she'd given up.

08:06.222 --> 08:08.232
- That's disappointing.
- Yeah.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.486
- I'll go and... check it out.
- Yeah.

08:29.214 --> 08:30.927
Oh, Boomer!

08:42.029 --> 08:45.495
Hello, Mr... Hey, Mr J.

08:46.513 --> 08:47.888
What's that, Boomer?

08:50.864 --> 08:53.361
- What you got in this?
- No! I don't have any.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.057
... and it's not even...

08:55.063 --> 08:58.357
It's not even fair, 'cause
I didn't fuckin' do nuffin!

08:58.363 --> 09:00.388
- I didn't... I didn't do nuffin!
- Come on.

09:00.394 --> 09:01.912
- Hey, what are you doin' with her?!
- She was drunk

09:01.918 --> 09:03.998
and had drugs in her cell.
Is that good enough for ya?

09:04.004 --> 09:05.784
Oh, Jesus, Boomer!

09:05.790 --> 09:08.145
What... ?! It wasn't fuckin' mine!

09:08.369 --> 09:10.761
Mr Jackson, j... oh, fuck!

09:10.767 --> 09:13.741
I think Mr Jackson put it there.
I think he fuckin' put it there!

09:13.747 --> 09:16.660
- Okay...
- You... what did I do to you?!

10:23.465 --> 10:25.971
What I can tell you is
that she came to see me...

10:25.977 --> 10:27.548
to talk about you.

10:28.947 --> 10:31.533
I think she was confused, but...

10:31.834 --> 10:34.615
very clear to me that
she was deeply in love.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.925
Sorry.

10:43.385 --> 10:45.330
Sorry.

10:45.336 --> 10:46.603
It's okay.

10:46.609 --> 10:49.893
I didn't mean to come
in here and just blubber.

10:51.309 --> 10:54.902
I just can't handle the fact
that she's not coming back.

10:55.210 --> 10:57.797
I know the sadness feels
like it'll last forever,

10:57.803 --> 10:59.348
but it will get easier.

10:59.421 --> 11:01.718
And don't... block it out.

11:01.724 --> 11:04.825
You know, let yourself
feel it. That's how we heal.

11:05.390 --> 11:08.288
Don't be tempted to
block it out with drugs.

11:08.382 --> 11:09.582
Uh, um...

11:10.584 --> 11:13.587
I promised her I would never use again.

11:13.593 --> 11:15.176
Mm-hm, good.

11:16.142 --> 11:19.260
Because being clean for a
while makes it very easy to OD.

11:20.406 --> 11:23.127
You'd know that from
recent experience, right?

11:30.480 --> 11:31.680
Yeah.

11:34.352 --> 11:35.552
I do.

13:00.143 --> 13:03.232
All prisoners are to report

13:04.126 --> 13:06.281
Oh, Mr Jackson,
what's happened to Boomer?

13:06.287 --> 13:08.115
- Yeah, we heard you slotted her, why?
- Yeah.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.225
'Cause she was drunk
and I found drugs in her cell.

13:10.231 --> 13:12.258
- Oh, no way!
- That's his story.

13:12.368 --> 13:13.568
What's that mean?

13:13.574 --> 13:15.858
- Truth is he's behind it.
- Give it a rest, Proctor.

13:15.864 --> 13:18.882
He planted drugs in Boomer's
cell to protect his dealer.

13:18.888 --> 13:20.562
- What bullshit.
- Is it?

13:22.773 --> 13:24.635
Look, I know for a fact...

13:24.842 --> 13:27.333
he lost the Deputyship
because he's a drug user.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.334
Try and deny that, why don'tcha.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.745
- You're a dickhead, you know that?
- Yeah.

13:39.490 --> 13:41.975
Yeah... scurry off.

13:43.553 --> 13:45.390
Guilty fucking prick.

15:43.864 --> 15:45.064
Shit!

16:12.198 --> 16:13.398
Lost something?

16:13.404 --> 16:15.792
God! Think I dropped my swipe card.

16:15.798 --> 16:17.612
- That's bad.
- Yeah, I know.

16:17.618 --> 16:19.907
Don't s'pose anyone's
handed one in have they?

16:20.745 --> 16:21.957
Yeah, right.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.149
Um...

16:24.742 --> 16:26.463
would you be able to,
um...

16:26.469 --> 16:28.147
check to see where it was last used

16:28.153 --> 16:30.742
so I can find it before
the situation turns to shit?

16:30.748 --> 16:32.284
If it hasn't already, you mean.

16:32.290 --> 16:33.490
Oh, Linda, uh...

16:33.496 --> 16:35.251
er, I'd really appreciate your help.

16:35.257 --> 16:37.634
All right, come on.

16:38.525 --> 16:41.744
Remember what happened to the last
person who lost their swipe card.

16:41.861 --> 16:43.061
Yeah, right.

17:00.594 --> 17:02.829
What the fuck are you doing?!

17:06.185 --> 17:08.796
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't report you?

17:09.807 --> 17:11.007
I'm a good root.

17:11.094 --> 17:12.294
What the fuck?!

17:13.087 --> 17:15.099
Oh, you think this is funny do you?

17:15.321 --> 17:18.907
Not to mention, getting
Novak to do your dirty work.

17:19.635 --> 17:22.232
What if someone else had
caught you with my card?!

17:22.330 --> 17:23.944
I would lose my job!

17:23.951 --> 17:25.244
Yeah, but they didn't, did they?

17:25.251 --> 17:28.161
You're compromising me now,
expecting me to cover for you!

17:29.515 --> 17:30.715
So, will you?

17:32.013 --> 17:34.310
What?!

17:37.494 --> 17:39.960
What were you trying to do... escape?!

17:40.359 --> 17:43.549
Steal the brawler and
smash through the gates?!

17:43.555 --> 17:44.897
Oh, that's...

17:45.359 --> 17:47.167
That's fuckin' crazy!

17:47.173 --> 17:48.995
No, it's not crazy.

17:49.267 --> 17:51.091
I'm alone in here, Gidge,

17:51.368 --> 17:53.875
and if I get convicted I'm
gonna wither up and die.

17:55.868 --> 17:58.056
I'm fucked!

18:02.071 --> 18:03.876
I just wanna hold ya.

18:07.246 --> 18:10.949
You promise me you'll never pull
a stunt like that again... ever.

18:10.955 --> 18:12.155
Yeah.

18:12.666 --> 18:14.182
Yeah, okay.

18:16.955 --> 18:19.017
Look at me.

18:22.002 --> 18:23.856
You promise me.

18:26.317 --> 18:27.517
I promise.

18:36.541 --> 18:39.560
What a fuckin' mess.

18:44.294 --> 18:45.494
Oh.

18:46.669 --> 18:47.869
Hey.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.075
Hey.

18:49.081 --> 18:50.281
How'd it go?

18:50.287 --> 18:52.234
It's all good. No wuckers.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.935
Okay, great. 'Cause I've
gotta get that swipe card

18:53.941 --> 18:56.045
back to Ms Westfall, before
she knows it's missing.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.435
Nah, no need, it's all sorted.

18:57.441 --> 18:58.726
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:02.451 --> 19:04.130
Are you gonna tell me why you wanted it?

19:04.641 --> 19:05.841
Nuh.

19:06.902 --> 19:09.147
Okay, well are you sure
it's all taken care of?

19:09.153 --> 19:12.657
'Cause I feel bad pulling a
swifty on Ms Westfall like that.

19:12.663 --> 19:14.215
She's a really top chick.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.466
It's all good.

19:25.996 --> 19:27.379
It was Will Jackson.

19:27.675 --> 19:29.684
He planted the drugs on her.

19:29.982 --> 19:32.419
Okay, why would Mr Jackson do that?

19:32.425 --> 19:35.021
Because he's supplying the women
and he wanted Boomer slotted

19:35.027 --> 19:37.732
- to protect his business interests.
- Okay, please don't waste my time

19:37.738 --> 19:39.405
with ridiculous accusations.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.029
There has to be an officer involved.

19:41.035 --> 19:42.235
Think about it.

19:42.946 --> 19:47.056
How could drugs be rife so
soon after your crackdown?

19:50.224 --> 19:53.319
If you don't do something about
this I'll take it to the Ombudsman.

19:53.787 --> 19:55.026
Yep, fine.

19:55.032 --> 19:57.013
Fine, but I hear he's quite busy.

19:58.729 --> 20:00.244
Thank you for your time.

20:03.761 --> 20:05.632
Attention, compound.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.289
Count will commence in five minutes.

20:23.804 --> 20:25.007
Okay, Dors,

20:25.013 --> 20:27.637
let's hear your speech. Lay it on me.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.790
I can't, Franky, I mean...

20:29.796 --> 20:32.749
I'm so friggin' nervous I can't
even bloody think straight.

20:32.755 --> 20:35.385
All right, first of
all... you gotta calm the fuck down.

20:35.391 --> 20:37.320
It's tomorrow, for Christ's sake!

20:37.326 --> 20:38.845
I mean, look!

20:39.838 --> 20:41.038
I got an idea.

20:41.150 --> 20:42.672
Oi! Idiots!

20:42.678 --> 20:44.035
Now, we're gonna be the board.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.909
- Oh, wow, so it's like a role play?
- Yeah.

20:45.915 --> 20:47.815
Oh, in that case, I grant
us all immediate parole.

20:47.821 --> 20:49.209
- Oh, yes! Yes!
- Thank you!

20:49.215 --> 20:50.652
Okay, Dors, so give us your speech

20:50.658 --> 20:52.864
and you two are gonna heckle
the livin' shit out of her.

20:52.870 --> 20:54.070
- Ooh, okay.
- Yes!

20:54.249 --> 20:56.245
Okay.

20:56.704 --> 20:59.415
- My name is Doreen Anderson...
- Doreen,

20:59.421 --> 21:00.866
- Ooh!
- ... that's a bit old-fashioned.

21:00.872 --> 21:02.278
- That doesn't sound indigenous...
- Nah.

21:02.284 --> 21:03.864
- ... to me.
- Well, you don't stop, keep going.

21:04.162 --> 21:05.683
I'm 26 years old...

21:05.689 --> 21:07.681
- Bullshit! You look older.
- Yep.

21:07.687 --> 21:10.942
In 2012, I was charged with
reckless endangerment and...

21:10.948 --> 21:13.112
If you're lying about your age, Doreen,

21:13.118 --> 21:14.753
what else could you be lying about?

21:14.759 --> 21:16.208
- Oh... oh, shut up!
- Ooh, good point. Yeah.

21:16.214 --> 21:17.509
Just ignore them, keep goin'.

21:17.515 --> 21:19.410
How am I supposed to talk
with them carrying on?

21:19.416 --> 21:20.862
Well, that's the whole point!

21:20.868 --> 21:22.841
- We're desensitising ya.
- Why?

21:22.847 --> 21:24.113
'Cause when you can get
through your speech with

21:24.119 --> 21:26.941
people hanging shit on you, which
is basically your worst nightmare,

21:26.947 --> 21:29.682
then, tomorrow, you'll cream it.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.945
- Easy-peasy.
- Japanesey.

21:32.299 --> 21:33.807
So, come on, talk.

21:33.813 --> 21:35.393
Speech, speech, speech, speech!

21:35.399 --> 21:36.733
- Hey!
- Shhh. Hey, let her go.

21:39.096 --> 21:42.464
- My name is Doreen Anderson...
- Anderson, that's an unusual surname.

21:42.470 --> 21:44.024
- I'm 26 years old...
- Now see, I don't think...

21:44.030 --> 21:46.100
- Good!
- 200!

21:46.106 --> 21:47.701
... and drug and alcohol affected...

21:47.707 --> 21:48.914
- Oh, she's a garbage person.
- Love it!

21:48.920 --> 21:50.120
I was sentenced to five

21:50.126 --> 21:51.444
- years at Wentworth, and after
- Is that normal?

21:51.450 --> 21:52.782
- Not enough!
- four and a half...

21:56.588 --> 21:59.541
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

21:59.787 --> 22:02.802
H Block are now called for breakfast.

22:15.711 --> 22:17.604
Hey, how you doin'?

22:17.610 --> 22:19.162
- You worried about your committal?
- Attention, compound.

22:19.168 --> 22:21.008
- Nah! Been to one committal
- Attention, compound...

22:21.014 --> 22:22.617
- you been to 'em all.
- Yeah, that's true.

22:22.623 --> 22:23.823
- Doyle!
- Mwah!

22:23.829 --> 22:25.029
- See ya.
- See ya.

22:25.035 --> 22:27.360
Your hearing's been postponed.
You're off the hook today.

22:27.366 --> 22:28.933
No, no, no, it's gotta be today.

22:28.939 --> 22:30.742
There's a backlog at the
courts, it got bumped.

22:30.748 --> 22:32.010
So when?

22:32.016 --> 22:33.498
I dunno, I'm just the messenger.

22:35.970 --> 22:38.391
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck!

22:38.689 --> 22:40.683
Oi, Miss Fancy-pants..

22:40.689 --> 22:42.685
- we need to have a little chat.
- Mm-hm.

22:42.691 --> 22:45.673
- And what would you like to chat about?
- Well, for starters...

22:45.679 --> 22:48.134
ah, can I offer you some free advice?

22:48.140 --> 22:50.120
By all means.

22:50.126 --> 22:52.928
You're gonna need some protection

22:52.934 --> 22:55.696
now you're not with Bea and her H1 crew.

22:55.702 --> 22:58.290
Protection... from whom?

23:00.116 --> 23:02.428
"From whom?", don't you love it?!

23:02.711 --> 23:05.719
You see the thing is, some
of the women in here...

23:05.725 --> 23:09.719
would like nothing better than to
soil up that fancy clobber of yours.

23:09.725 --> 23:11.336
Mess your hair...

23:11.446 --> 23:13.344
fuck up your face...

23:14.423 --> 23:15.735
I see.

23:16.506 --> 23:17.706
Well...

23:17.815 --> 23:21.042
thank you for sharing that
insight, it's been most valuable...

23:21.048 --> 23:23.229
But...

23:23.713 --> 23:28.751
The boys and I will be more than
happy to oblige by watching your back.

23:28.757 --> 23:30.533
- You would?!
- Mmmm.

23:30.709 --> 23:33.300
Cash donation to our Christmas fund...

23:33.306 --> 23:37.017
- could be negotiated. Mmm.
- Oh, that's very kind.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.311
Or...

23:38.317 --> 23:39.600
on the other hand...

23:39.606 --> 23:42.016
perhaps I could offer
you some free advice?

23:42.891 --> 23:45.627
I don't respond well to extortion.

23:46.505 --> 23:48.208
Now, if you'll excuse me.

23:52.681 --> 23:53.881
Come on.

23:57.619 --> 24:00.713
... you'd too so... Just... I can't.

24:00.719 --> 24:02.448
- I've gotta take one full pot.
- Proctor?!

24:02.454 --> 24:04.025
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for court?

24:04.031 --> 24:05.815
No, my appeal got postponed again.

24:05.821 --> 24:07.823
Nope, it's back on.
Didn't you get the message?

24:07.910 --> 24:10.044
- What, today?!
- You better shake a leg.

24:10.050 --> 24:13.293
Oh, fuck, finally! Finally!

24:13.299 --> 24:14.948
A little bit of notice
would have been good,

24:14.954 --> 24:16.991
- huh? Okay!
- Talk to your lawyer.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.290
- I can't believe you'd think,
- _

24:18.296 --> 24:20.928
for one second, that I'm
supplying drugs to the women.

24:20.934 --> 24:22.490
I don't, but what I think...

24:22.496 --> 24:24.151
- isn't relevant.
- Well, it is to me!

24:24.157 --> 24:25.459
You know, that as Governor,

24:25.465 --> 24:28.691
I am required to follow through
on any information given to me.

24:28.697 --> 24:31.589
What... what... what, even crap
dreamt up by the likes of Proctor.

24:31.595 --> 24:32.931
You know she's got it in for me.

24:32.937 --> 24:35.451
Her allegation was
reiterated by Jenkins.

24:35.457 --> 24:37.744
Hello... after I slotted
her for drug possession.

24:37.750 --> 24:39.859
Look, I know it will be proven spurious,

24:39.865 --> 24:41.433
but you do have a history of drug use,

24:41.439 --> 24:43.887
and if I don't investigate it
Proctor's going to the Ombudsman.

24:43.893 --> 24:45.456
What, so you're making this official,

24:45.462 --> 24:47.599
you don't want me back as Deputy then?

24:47.735 --> 24:48.935
W... ?

24:49.150 --> 24:51.588
- I didn't say that.
- No, you're just gonna let that bitch

24:51.594 --> 24:53.474
Proctor bang another nail in my coffin.

25:07.362 --> 25:09.073
Thank you.

25:13.369 --> 25:15.292
Hey, Linda, I got this.

25:15.298 --> 25:16.757
You can take the J Block shift.

25:16.763 --> 25:19.240
Suits me, court's boring as batshit.

25:24.029 --> 25:25.251
Get in.

25:26.341 --> 25:28.386
Your days are numbered, Jackson.

25:42.042 --> 25:44.847
My name is Doreen Anderson...

25:45.535 --> 25:47.384
I'm 26 years old.

25:48.637 --> 25:51.879
In 2012, I was sentenced to five years

25:51.885 --> 25:54.652
and I've served four and
half here in Wentworth.

25:54.658 --> 25:57.943
I was previously denied a parole
hearing by the former Governor,

25:58.542 --> 26:01.859
because I wasn't always
on my best behaviour.

26:03.527 --> 26:06.215
I fell pregnant while in jail.

26:10.221 --> 26:11.840
The thing is...

26:12.625 --> 26:15.821
that turned out to be the best
thing that ever happened to me.

26:16.431 --> 26:19.213
You see, back in 2012 I was 21

26:19.219 --> 26:21.536
and didn't really have
any family support.

26:21.721 --> 26:25.476
Now, I'm not trying to shift
responsibility for what I did...

26:26.032 --> 26:27.894
I hurt people...

26:28.394 --> 26:30.683
and I deserve to be in here,

26:30.996 --> 26:34.503
but the person I hurt
the most was myself.

26:34.780 --> 26:37.683
I lost my unborn baby

26:37.689 --> 26:40.876
because I was stupid and careless,

26:41.248 --> 26:43.788
and I'll never forgive myself for that.

26:45.373 --> 26:47.678
If you believe in natural justice,

26:47.684 --> 26:49.083
it was done...

26:49.874 --> 26:51.546
and then some.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.140
But life...

27:01.529 --> 27:04.173
has thrown me a second chance,

27:04.179 --> 27:06.549
with my little boy, Josh,

27:06.555 --> 27:08.865
and my beautiful partner, Nash.

27:09.132 --> 27:11.825
They've been my rehabilitation.

27:12.233 --> 27:15.014
I know I'm a better
person because of them,

27:15.305 --> 27:18.874
and I welcome the responsibility
of being a great partner

27:18.880 --> 27:20.548
and a great mum.

27:23.171 --> 27:26.390
That's why I want this
transfer to Perth...

27:27.377 --> 27:29.476
to be near my family,

27:29.987 --> 27:33.391
to continue my growth as a
human being, and hopefully...

27:37.311 --> 27:39.535
become a positive person...

27:40.051 --> 27:41.850
in my community.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.696
That's all I got to say.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.714
Thanks for hearing me.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.652
Thank you, Doreen.

28:02.745 --> 28:04.477
If there are no questions?

28:43.706 --> 28:45.432
Take the next exit, please.

28:45.438 --> 28:46.942
Ah, okay.

29:22.158 --> 29:23.786
The fuck is going on?

29:24.665 --> 29:26.056
Why have we stopped?

29:28.112 --> 29:29.521
Well, what do you want, a blow job?

29:29.527 --> 29:31.258
In your fuckin' dreams!

29:31.931 --> 29:34.721
You told the Governor that I was
supplying drugs to the women...

29:36.106 --> 29:37.306
You are.

29:37.879 --> 29:41.496
Your bullshit could ruin
my career, my fucking life!

29:41.502 --> 29:43.233
It's not my problem, I'm
lookin' after the women.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.830
Really, you're lookin' after the women?

29:44.836 --> 29:46.300
Well, you're doing a pretty shit job

29:46.306 --> 29:48.034
if you think I'm the fucking problem!

29:51.225 --> 29:52.511
Tough guy...

29:53.345 --> 29:56.506
menacing a handcuffed, vulnerable woman.

29:56.512 --> 29:58.235
You're not vulnerable...

29:58.580 --> 30:00.061
you're fucked!

30:00.385 --> 30:01.778
You're poison.

30:02.755 --> 30:05.771
I could rip your head off right
now and no one would give a shit!

30:11.238 --> 30:13.146
Hey, Will?!

30:37.048 --> 30:38.892
Oh, fuck!

30:38.947 --> 30:40.440
Oh, geez... !

30:40.446 --> 30:42.174
Oh, Richards!

30:43.949 --> 30:47.545
Argh!

30:51.663 --> 30:53.170
Arrrgh!

31:35.642 --> 31:36.927
Argh!

31:49.529 --> 31:50.729
Argh!

31:54.437 --> 31:56.342
Okay, come on, mate.

31:56.615 --> 31:57.815
Here goes.

32:02.145 --> 32:03.635
Call an ambulance!

32:04.218 --> 32:05.984
Huh! Huh!

32:08.401 --> 32:10.297
Get here, huh.

32:10.588 --> 32:12.330
Uh, ya!

32:13.232 --> 32:15.031
Argh! Huh!

32:15.198 --> 32:16.901
- Just call an ambulance, okay?
- Yep, yep.

32:16.907 --> 32:18.107
Hold his head, hold his head!

32:22.096 --> 32:23.807
Oh, fuck, Kaz!

32:40.350 --> 32:42.155
Arrgh! Proctor?!

32:42.161 --> 32:44.830
Proctor wake up, can
you hear me, come on!

32:44.932 --> 32:46.213
Proctor!

32:48.526 --> 32:49.726
Proctor!

32:49.934 --> 32:51.521
Come on, wake up! Come on!

32:51.911 --> 32:54.145
Proctor, open your eyes!

32:54.544 --> 32:56.414
Kaz!

32:56.505 --> 32:57.705
Argh, sh... !

32:57.961 --> 33:00.485
Argh! Ugh!

33:00.672 --> 33:03.585
Come on, Kaz. Kaz, come
on. I need you to wake up.

33:03.591 --> 33:04.795
Proctor!

33:07.253 --> 33:09.182
- Kaz, can you hear me?
- Huh?

33:09.449 --> 33:11.680
Arrrgh!

33:12.160 --> 33:13.559
- Oh!
- Kaz, let me...

33:13.565 --> 33:16.037
- I can't get out! Help me.
- Good, good, good...

33:16.043 --> 33:18.127
Hey there, Proctor, listen to me, okay?

33:18.133 --> 33:20.738
Stay calm. Stay calm, I'm
gonna get you out, all right?

33:20.936 --> 33:22.338
Hold there, hold there.

33:25.107 --> 33:26.307
Ugh!

33:27.625 --> 33:31.432
- Kaz, undo your seatbelt.
- I can't move my arm.

33:32.195 --> 33:33.677
Stay with me, Proctor.

33:39.107 --> 33:41.413
Argh! Argh!

33:51.315 --> 33:53.552
Let's do this thing. Come on.

33:53.558 --> 33:55.512
- Get the cuffs! Get the cuffs off!
- Just...

33:55.518 --> 33:58.761
- I broke my arm. I broke my arm!
- Have you? Okay. Okay.

33:59.257 --> 34:01.640
- What are you gonna do?
- Try not to hurt you.

34:01.646 --> 34:04.741
Ah. Arrrgh, fuck!

34:06.936 --> 34:08.655
The hell are you doing?

34:12.373 --> 34:14.147
Oh! Phew!

34:14.152 --> 34:17.186
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Whoa, hey, hey.

34:17.192 --> 34:19.475
Come on, come on. Stay with me. Hey?

34:19.481 --> 34:21.810
Just stay with me. Stay
with me. Hang on. Come on.

34:21.815 --> 34:24.216
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Okay. Hold on, hold on. All right,

34:24.222 --> 34:25.927
all right, all right. I'm just
going to put your arm in your...

34:25.933 --> 34:27.138
in your jacket, okay?

34:27.143 --> 34:29.591
- Don't... don't!
- Okay, hold it. It... it's okay.

34:29.597 --> 34:31.315
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right, okay.

34:31.322 --> 34:32.994
Arrrgh!

34:33.000 --> 34:34.696
- Ugh!
- You're okay. I gotcha.

34:34.702 --> 34:35.956
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:36.087 --> 34:37.967
Argh! Oh!

34:37.973 --> 34:41.659
Okay, Okay. It's okay. We
need to get out of here, okay?

34:41.766 --> 34:45.058
We need to get out of here. I
need you to hold your breath.

34:45.063 --> 34:46.636
Go straight through that hole, okay?

34:46.641 --> 34:48.386
I'm right behind you, all right?

34:48.391 --> 34:51.300
I promise. Hey, hey, listen. I promise.

34:51.306 --> 34:53.589
- Okay. All right, all right. Okay.
- I can't make it...

34:53.594 --> 34:55.813
- Okay. Okay. Just hold your breath.
- I can't...

34:55.819 --> 34:58.104
- Hold your breath. Hold your breath.
- make this...

Okay.

sabotaging the brawler, by any chance?

37:46.208 --> 37:47.329
No.

37:47.730 --> 37:49.648
- There's been an accident.
- What?

37:49.691 --> 37:53.139
- Who was in it?
- Will Jackson, Kaz Proctor, the driver.

37:53.145 --> 37:54.450
Oh, shit.

37:54.978 --> 37:57.080
Tell me you had nothing to do with it.

37:57.220 --> 37:58.630
I didn't.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.708
Well, are they all right?

38:03.814 --> 38:05.041
Dunno.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.527
Waiting to hear from emergency services.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.633
I dunno, but apparently, it was serious.

38:14.639 --> 38:17.333
- I heard it crashed into a river.
- Shit.

38:17.339 --> 38:20.496
Hey, Franky. Have you heard?

38:20.754 --> 38:22.364
I totally fucked up.

38:22.480 --> 38:24.746
What? It wasn't your fault.

38:55.453 --> 38:57.118
Kaz and Mr Jackson have been taken

38:57.124 --> 38:58.769
to hospital, but they're okay.

38:58.954 --> 39:00.360
You sure?

39:01.360 --> 39:03.495
Oh, thank fuck for that.

39:07.368 --> 39:09.117
What did you do to the brawler?

39:10.433 --> 39:11.863
Never meant anyone to get hurt.

39:11.869 --> 39:13.657
Well, what'd you think was gonna happen?

39:14.441 --> 39:17.231
I loosened one of the wheels.
I thought they'd transfer me

39:17.237 --> 39:19.044
- to another vehicle and...
- Oh, and what,

39:19.050 --> 39:20.638
you... you were gonna make a run for it?

39:20.644 --> 39:24.618
- Yes! Have you got any better ideas?
- It's so fucked up, Franky!

39:27.675 --> 39:29.458
Kaz could have died.

39:30.644 --> 39:32.592
And you made me a part of it.

39:36.955 --> 39:38.196
Elbows in.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.212
Counter-punch.

39:51.091 --> 39:52.294
Hey.

39:53.677 --> 39:55.317
I've done what you wanted.

39:55.408 --> 39:57.408
I put Kaz in hospital.

39:58.161 --> 40:00.273
That should prove I'm
not with her anymore.

40:00.877 --> 40:03.880
How? Was an accident.

40:04.132 --> 40:07.945
It was no accident. You
remember that missing shifter?

40:11.247 --> 40:13.990
I used it to loosen the
wheel nuts on the brawler.

40:15.036 --> 40:18.992
- How did you get to it?
- I stole Ms Westfall's swipe card.

40:19.870 --> 40:21.678
So can I get some H?

40:24.371 --> 40:25.941
It's a good story.

40:30.950 --> 40:35.074
Liz! Just the person I was lookin' for.

40:36.113 --> 40:39.847
We need to have a chat
about your friend Sonia.

40:40.730 --> 40:44.142
- What about her?
- She's a hard nut to crack.

40:44.934 --> 40:49.087
I want you to convince her she
needs the boys' and my protection.

40:49.093 --> 40:53.420
Why would I do that when you're
just trying to scab her money?

40:55.122 --> 40:57.944
Sonia know about your dicky ticker?

41:01.620 --> 41:03.628
So, when do you find
out about your transfer?

41:03.634 --> 41:05.531
Oh, soon I hope. I've already packed.

41:05.537 --> 41:07.707
Oh, you're confident. I like that.

41:07.713 --> 41:10.437
Three words, Sonia.
In... the... bag. Boom!

41:11.020 --> 41:13.411
You're very quiet, Liz.
Everything all right?

41:13.417 --> 41:15.833
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
I'm, oh, I'm just gonna miss Dor.

41:15.839 --> 41:17.327
- Ow.
- Ow.

41:17.333 --> 41:19.299
I tried. She won't budge.

41:19.305 --> 41:21.074
Snooty bitch!

41:28.395 --> 41:30.373
Right, everyone out.

41:30.379 --> 41:32.553
- Get out!
- Go on, fuck off!

41:32.559 --> 41:34.542
- Hurry up! Scamper!
- Fuck off!

41:36.146 --> 41:38.675
Not you. You can stay.

41:42.548 --> 41:44.089
What do you think you're doing?

41:44.376 --> 41:50.437
Me and the boys are about to
demonstrate why you need our protection.

41:52.826 --> 41:54.449
Look at yourself.

42:00.397 --> 42:02.061
Barbaric.

42:24.482 --> 42:27.446
Home delivery. Your story checked out.

42:29.458 --> 42:32.184
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me, just give me the cash.

42:37.263 --> 42:41.110
Attention, compound. Attention,
compound. This is a Code Blue.

42:41.896 --> 42:46.109
Attention all staff. Available
officer to Medical for escort. Over.

42:47.321 --> 42:51.045
Attention, compound. Attention,
compound. This is a Code Blue.

43:08.470 --> 43:10.327
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting.

43:10.333 --> 43:13.493
- Yeah. Yeah, the Code Blue.
- Take a seat.

43:14.458 --> 43:17.195
Don't suppose you'd know anything
about that, by any chance?

43:17.201 --> 43:19.224
Oh, no, Governor.

43:19.965 --> 43:22.887
So, you've got news about my transfer?

43:24.075 --> 43:26.246
Look, I'm very sorry to
have to tell you this,

43:26.252 --> 43:28.590
but your application was refused.

43:31.899 --> 43:33.573
Uh...

43:33.579 --> 43:35.542
I... I thought I'd done really well.

43:35.548 --> 43:38.244
Oh, you did. You couldn't have
presented your case any better.

43:38.250 --> 43:40.991
- I have to say, I'm surprised, too.
- Then why?

43:40.997 --> 43:43.046
They didn't give a reason.
It was just a simple no.

43:43.052 --> 43:44.673
You'll get a full
response in due course.

43:44.679 --> 43:46.532
What am I gonna do now?

43:46.538 --> 43:49.590
Look, it's only six months till
your parole. It'll go quickly.

43:49.596 --> 43:51.433
But even when I get parole, Governor,

43:51.439 --> 43:54.347
I can't get on a plane
until Corrections say so.

43:54.353 --> 43:56.401
And that could take forever.

43:56.666 --> 44:00.404
My baby won't remember me by
the time I get out of here!

44:02.604 --> 44:03.957
I'm so sorry, Doreen.

44:03.963 --> 44:06.200
I... I'll be sure to give
you extra phone privileges.

44:06.206 --> 44:09.006
I don't want extra phone privileges.

44:09.104 --> 44:11.299
I want to see my son.

44:16.818 --> 44:19.500
I'm here to see Sonia.
I'm her Peer Worker.

44:19.506 --> 44:21.395
Maybe you can find out
who did this to her.

44:21.401 --> 44:23.037
She wouldn't tell the Gov a thing.

44:23.197 --> 44:26.913
Oh, and you think I wanna be
eating through a straw too, do you?

44:27.829 --> 44:29.222
- Five minutes.
- Mm.

44:29.228 --> 44:30.735
She's not up for much at all.

44:33.041 --> 44:34.468
Shit!

44:35.158 --> 44:36.861
Mm, is she gonna be all right?

44:37.025 --> 44:39.408
ACL one side, sprained ankle the other.

44:39.414 --> 44:40.855
She won't be walking for a while.

44:40.861 --> 44:43.353
- The rest are just superficial.
- Right.

44:54.167 --> 44:55.460
Sonia?

44:55.851 --> 44:57.952
- It's Liz.
- Mm.

44:57.958 --> 44:59.598
Can you hear me, love?

44:59.604 --> 45:01.281
Woman... what...

45:01.830 --> 45:03.691
It's all right, don't...
don't try and talk.

45:03.697 --> 45:05.569
I just wanted you to know I was here.

45:06.982 --> 45:11.017
All the girls are really sorry to
hear about your fall in the shower.

45:11.391 --> 45:13.614
And they hope you're
back with us really soon.

45:15.704 --> 45:17.759
But if you ask me,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.614
I reckon you should
move into Protection.

45:21.509 --> 45:26.034
Even if you give 'em what they
want, it'll never be enough, love.

45:27.651 --> 45:29.844
Ask to be put in Protection.

45:31.667 --> 45:33.533
No.

45:34.849 --> 45:36.228
They can't...

45:38.032 --> 45:39.355
win.

45:54.429 --> 45:56.867
Do I have to spend the night
in the Medical Holding Unit?

45:57.239 --> 46:00.851
Well, you took a hit to the
head. You have to be under obs.

46:02.450 --> 46:04.445
It's not a good look for a Top Dog.

46:05.526 --> 46:07.414
Broken arm's bad enough.

46:07.420 --> 46:08.726
Not your call.

46:15.965 --> 46:17.966
Um...

46:17.972 --> 46:21.754
I, um, wanted to thank
you for rescuing me.

46:22.981 --> 46:25.074
I think you saved my life today.

46:27.487 --> 46:30.193
Well, I'm not sure you
deserve it, but anyway...

46:32.384 --> 46:33.995
What was I gonna do?

46:34.898 --> 46:36.098
Yeah.

46:43.123 --> 46:44.537
Um...

46:46.626 --> 46:49.010
You know, maybe things'll
be different in the future.

47:03.826 --> 47:05.632
Now is the time.

47:06.950 --> 47:09.436
Tuesday, 08:30PM.

47:09.817 --> 47:11.929
You need to take control, Proctor.

47:11.935 --> 47:13.135
Take some action.

47:13.141 --> 47:15.116
What are you suggesting, Governor?

47:15.152 --> 47:17.683
Now, I gave an order that
Ferguson was invisible.

47:17.689 --> 47:20.287
If anyone has an issue
with the way I run things,

47:20.293 --> 47:22.110
now's your chance to spit it out.

47:23.136 --> 47:25.567
There are two ways to rule the rabble:

47:25.814 --> 47:28.299
you can try to appeal to the people...

47:29.380 --> 47:31.021
or you can terrify them.

47:31.027 --> 47:35.474
Wentworth. Tuesday, 08:30PM on ShowCase.
