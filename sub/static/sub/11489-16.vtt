WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:05.350
So, I'm thinking we serve the
good wine before the ceremony,

00:05.360 --> 00:08.440
And then at the reception,
after everybody's got a little buzz on,

00:08.450 --> 00:10.440
we uncork the crap.

00:11.470 --> 00:16.309
Alan, I do not want to cheap out on
what is very possibly my last wedding.

00:17.990 --> 00:19.500
He's always been stingy.

00:19.510 --> 00:22.970
I remember once, when he was a little
boy, he accidentally swallowed
a quarter.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.700
Refused to poop for a week.

00:26.580 --> 00:29.630
Mom, for god's sakes.
This is my futurstepsister.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.910
Oh, relax, alan.
I think it's cute.

00:31.928 --> 00:32.910
Cute?

00:32.923 --> 00:36.939
He's so tight, I wouldn't have been
surprised if only two dimes came out.

00:38.527 --> 00:41.519
Mom, I'm begging you.

00:41.528 --> 00:44.575
Would you feel any better if I told
you something embarrassing about me?

00:44.589 --> 00:45.291
Yes.

00:45.307 --> 00:46.903
Promise not to laugh?

00:46.915 --> 00:49.022
- Promise.
- All right.

00:49.527 --> 00:53.583
I have never in my
life refused to poop.

00:59.155 --> 01:02.373
You are so mean. I love you.

01:03.365 --> 01:05.941
I think I liked it better when
you two didn't get along.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.652
Well, those days are over.

01:07.668 --> 01:11.680
Once I saw how happy evie makes my
father, I could have married her myself.

01:11.695 --> 01:15.173
Oh, thank you, sweetheart. And you're
like the daughter I never had.

01:15.186 --> 01:17.611
Not that he didn't try.

01:20.398 --> 01:23.963
You should have seen him parading around
in my earrings and my high heels.

01:23.977 --> 01:26.862
"Look at me, mommy,
I'm pretty. "

01:28.787 --> 01:31.313
he wasn't, of course.

01:32.918 --> 01:37.772
Oh, darling, I'm just teasing you.
You're all man.

01:38.215 --> 01:42.182
Thanks. Okay,
let's talk appetizers.

01:42.197 --> 01:46.623
Charlie: Hey, alan, how long do I
have before bridezilla gets here?

01:47.248 --> 01:51.051
Gee, charlie, I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:51.066 --> 01:53.273
Charlie: She's already here,
isn't she?

01:53.285 --> 01:55.913
Yes, dear. Come on down.

01:55.925 --> 01:57.540
It's a little game we play.

01:57.555 --> 02:01.513
I show him unconditional love,
and he's an ungrateful little pissant.

02:03.825 --> 02:04.771
Hey, mom.

02:04.787 --> 02:07.703
Hello, dear.
You remember teddy's daughter, courtney?

02:07.718 --> 02:09.650
How could I forget?

02:09.666 --> 02:11.000
Nice to see you again.

02:11.017 --> 02:13.092
Nice to see you, too.

02:13.106 --> 02:16.433
Evelyn: Cour tney and your brother are
helping me with the
wedding arrangements.

02:16.448 --> 02:18.602
It's your fifth wedding, mom.

02:18.618 --> 02:23.743
What do you need help with,
besides remembering the groom's name?

02:25.037 --> 02:29.232
You know, I'd cut him out of the will if
I thought there was a chance he'd
outlive me.

02:31.388 --> 02:32.480
Hello?

02:32.498 --> 02:35.862
Oh, teddy, darling. What's up?

02:36.706 --> 02:38.253
Excuse me.

02:38.265 --> 02:41.501
That's wonderful.
Can you keep it up till I get there?

02:43.586 --> 02:46.371
All right, all right, I just want to
make sure we're all on the same
page here.

02:46.405 --> 02:49.290
This-this wedding will be absolutely
ruined if mom finds out that

02:49.307 --> 02:52.363
her son and her future stepdaughter
have been carrying on behind her back.

02:52.375 --> 02:53.833
- Don't worry.
- She won'T.

02:53.847 --> 02:57.840
No, I do worry. There-there can
be no flirting, no innuendo.

02:58.445 --> 03:01.833
Don't worry about in you endo.
Worry about in her endo.

03:04.437 --> 03:07.481
Everybody keeps their
troublemakers in their pants.

03:07.498 --> 03:11.103
Hey, I'll coepate,
but I can't speak for my troublemaker.

03:11.115 --> 03:15.263
Ev yn:Elalan! Teddy wants to talk
to you about the boutonnieres.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.282
Coming!

03:17.295 --> 03:19.723
I knew he'd fight me on this.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.913
So, when can we get together?

03:24.928 --> 03:28.203
We can'T. You and I are done.

03:28.215 --> 03:30.110
Why, just because
of what alan said?

03:30.125 --> 03:31.761
Nobody listens to alan.

03:31.775 --> 03:34.841
Hell, half the time,
alan doesn't listen to alan.

03:34.857 --> 03:36.962
Look, I finally have a good
relationship with your mother,

03:36.995 --> 03:38.433
and I'd like to
keep it that way.

03:38.445 --> 03:41.892
Hey, a good relationship with
my mother is ghly overrated.

03:41.907 --> 03:44.660
Look at me.
I've gone my whole life without one.

03:44.678 --> 03:46.723
Charlie, get it
through your head.

03:46.736 --> 03:49.940
You and I-- no more.

03:52.335 --> 03:56.341
If it were that simple,
they wouldn't call it a troublemaker.

04:04.707 --> 04:06.581
I'd like to make
a little toast.

04:06.597 --> 04:08.411
To our families
coming together.

04:08.428 --> 04:09.740
Hear, hear.

04:09.756 --> 04:11.743
To coming together.

04:13.555 --> 04:17.120
Evelyn is gaining a daughter,
and I'm gaining two sons.

04:17.147 --> 04:19.940
- And a grandson.
- Don't interrupt.

04:19.954 --> 04:21.541
And I'd like to
say something else.

04:21.558 --> 04:24.370
I want this to be an
old-fashioned marriage.

04:24.385 --> 04:27.621
Darling, what's mine is yours.

04:27.638 --> 04:30.461
We do not need a prenup.

04:30.477 --> 04:32.851
Teddy, we've talked about this.

04:32.865 --> 04:35.880
You have a lot of money.
You should be protected.

04:35.898 --> 04:38.223
I don't need to be
protected from you, baby.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.713
- Daddy,ait a minute...
- courtney, this is none of your business.

04:40.747 --> 04:43.240
-But, dad! But nothing.

04:43.257 --> 04:44.960
Tlovei his woman,

04:44.976 --> 04:49.722
and I am not going to bet against our
marriage by bringing a bunch of lawyers
into it.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.032
He must really love her.

04:54.045 --> 04:56.791
Yeah. The schmuck.

04:58.795 --> 05:00.973
Excuse me.

05:07.645 --> 05:10.750
I had a thought about
the ice sculpture.

05:12.516 --> 05:17.213
A lot of people go with cupid, but you
got to remember, the bow and arrow
melts first,

05:17.236 --> 05:20.823
and what you're left with is
a fat kid dancing in shrimp.

05:22.316 --> 05:24.211
There's gonna be shrimp?

05:24.226 --> 05:25.821
For the guests.

05:25.848 --> 05:26.781
So, what am I?

05:26.796 --> 05:29.633
Don't feed me
straight lines, dear.

05:29.648 --> 05:30.942
Excuse me.

05:33.236 --> 05:36.772
Why would I feed her straight
lines if there's shrimp?

05:38.000 --> 05:44.074

05:49.928 --> 05:51.143
Courtney: I'll be
out in a minute.

05:51.178 --> 05:54.242
I can't wait.
Better let me in now.

05:54.255 --> 05:56.211
Charlie, get out of here.

05:56.226 --> 05:59.160
Oh, come on.
You can't just cut me off like this.

05:59.175 --> 06:03.071
Hey, I can cut off whoever
or whatever I want.

06:03.918 --> 06:07.410
Are you playing hard to get
because you know it turns me on?

06:07.987 --> 06:09.603
I'm not playing, charlie.

06:09.816 --> 06:14.300
Okay, I just have to say,
not playing turns me on more.

06:15.728 --> 06:18.201
Alan: Charlie,
are you in there with courtney?

06:18.216 --> 06:19.732
No.

06:20.975 --> 06:22.961
- Hi, courtney.
- Hi, alan.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.711
I thought we had an agreement.

06:24.726 --> 06:28.142
Yeah, the agreement was,
mom doesn't find out.

06:29.046 --> 06:32.052
Courtney? You okay, dear?

06:32.067 --> 06:34.013
Oh, I'm fine, evelyn.

06:34.606 --> 06:38.293
I thought you might be upset
about that prenup nonsense,

06:38.315 --> 06:41.690
and I just want you to know,
I'm not after your father's money.

06:41.707 --> 06:44.040
Courtney: I'm sure you're not.

06:46.526 --> 06:48.653
Believe me,
I have plenty of my own money.

06:48.665 --> 06:50.181
Of course,
don't tell alan and charlie.

06:50.215 --> 06:52.813
They're annoying
enough as it is.

06:53.525 --> 06:56.103
I won'T.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.851
So, exactly how rich are you?

06:59.867 --> 07:01.292
I do all right.

07:02.876 --> 07:06.081
When you marry my grandma,
what does that make you to me?

07:06.865 --> 07:09.613
Nothing.

07:10.868 --> 07:12.082
Sorry, dear.

07:12.105 --> 07:13.430
Oh, that's all right.

07:13.446 --> 07:15.152
I was talking to the kid.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.900
Isn't that nice.

07:16.916 --> 07:21.533
You know, even if we're not related,
yocan still buy me birthday and
christmas presents.

07:21.748 --> 07:24.570
Thanks for the tip.

07:25.095 --> 07:26.522
Alan: I don't believe it.

07:26.535 --> 07:31.111
If mom's got so much money, how come
we still get books for christmas?

07:31.767 --> 07:33.140
Let it go, alan.

07:33.157 --> 07:37.583
Whatever money she has, most likely has
got an ancient curse attached to it.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.043
What are you doing?

07:42.057 --> 07:44.961
I'm here.
I figure, what the hell?

07:45.727 --> 07:47.422
Just remember to put
the seat back down.

07:47.507 --> 07:50.513
It's a ladies' room.
Why do they even go up?

07:50.525 --> 07:54.890
I don't know. It's a bigger target for
broads who want to puke their dinner.

07:55.973 --> 07:59.119
Makes sense. All right.

07:59.127 --> 08:01.679
Let's talk about courtney.

08:02.658 --> 08:03.805
What do you want me
to tell you, alan?

08:03.839 --> 08:06.291
I want you to tell me why
you're so obsessed with her.

08:06.315 --> 08:07.593
Isn't it obvious?

08:07.606 --> 08:09.633
She drinks, she smokes,
she gambles.

08:09.647 --> 08:12.590
She's me with indoor plumbing.

08:16.575 --> 08:18.953
What are you doing
in the ladies' room?

08:18.968 --> 08:21.710
Uh, the men's room
was occupied.

08:21.737 --> 08:23.641
Do you have to
pee sitting down?

08:23.655 --> 08:26.463
- No, the seats go up.
- Cool.

08:28.828 --> 08:31.370
Hey, it smells nice in here.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.863
Hey, courtney, it's charlie.
Your brother.

08:43.067 --> 08:47.361
Anyway, I just wanted to apologize for
making a scene there in the restaurant.

08:47.377 --> 08:49.781
Would still love to get together,
so give me a call.

08:49.795 --> 08:53.642
I'm just sitting at
home reading a book.

08:55.475 --> 08:58.660
And watching tv.

09:00.308 --> 09:04.083
Disney channel. 101 dalmatians.

09:04.098 --> 09:07.140
What a great film, huh?

09:08.388 --> 09:10.830
Oop, sat on the remote.

09:10.845 --> 09:13.540
Hey, apocalypse now.

09:13.557 --> 09:16.150
Another great movie, huh?

09:16.165 --> 09:19.211
Anyway, call me.

09:25.587 --> 09:28.232
- hi, chlie.
- Rose?

09:28.608 --> 09:31.183
What the hell are
you doing here?

09:31.196 --> 09:33.673
I could ask you that question.

09:33.685 --> 09:37.091
And the answer would
be the same: Stalking.

09:38.498 --> 09:40.540
No, no, I'm not, uh...

09:40.555 --> 09:42.493
Good at it?

09:44.156 --> 09:45.441
What do you want?

09:45.458 --> 09:48.642
- Right now, or long-term?
- Rose!

09:48.655 --> 09:51.430
I've just been watching
you for an hour and...

09:51.448 --> 09:53.993
38 minutes,
and I felt bad for you.

09:54.005 --> 09:56.190
I thought maybe you
could use some help.

09:56.207 --> 09:57.643
Thanks, but I'm fine.

09:57.677 --> 10:00.071
Rely? Did you bring water?

10:00.085 --> 10:01.911
No.

10:03.496 --> 10:06.321
- Trail mix?
- No.

10:09.215 --> 10:10.803
Pee jar?

10:10.817 --> 10:13.163
Oh, that would have
been a great idea.

10:13.178 --> 10:15.152
Here you go.

10:16.377 --> 10:17.951
Thank you.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.973
Let's see, what else?

10:20.008 --> 10:23.041
Ooh, night vision goggles?

10:23.746 --> 10:25.082
I don't think so.

10:25.097 --> 10:27.091
You say that now,
but if you hide in her trunk,

10:27.106 --> 10:30.501
and want to do a little light reading,
you're gonna be sorry.

10:30.865 --> 10:33.260
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

10:33.615 --> 10:35.393
I'll just keep you company.

10:35.407 --> 10:38.960
Give me one of these if you
need to use the pee jar.

10:39.488 --> 10:42.242
Charlie, what the
hell are you doing?

10:43.887 --> 10:45.960
Teddy, how are you?

10:45.976 --> 10:48.063
Since when do you
drive a volvo?

10:48.076 --> 10:49.760
Uh, it's my brother's car.

10:49.775 --> 10:52.302
Very smart.
She would have spotted your car.

10:52.316 --> 10:54.922
I didn't give you
points for that.

10:54.936 --> 10:59.433
I thought you and I had an understanding
that you and my daughter weren't gonna
see each other anymore.

10:59.446 --> 11:01.792
Well, in my defense, sir,
we're not really seeing each other.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.413
This is more of a, um...

11:03.428 --> 11:05.773
Reconnaissance mission.

11:05.788 --> 11:07.720
Who is this?

11:07.736 --> 11:09.920
Oh, uh, this is rose.

11:09.938 --> 11:12.961
- She's kind of my, um...
- sidekick.

11:14.597 --> 11:17.172
I don't wanna beat this to death,
but if your mother finds out

11:17.186 --> 11:20.332
that you and courtney are seeing each
other and thinks I kept it from her,

11:20.345 --> 11:22.921
I don't know what she'd do,
probably call off the wedding.

11:22.935 --> 11:24.571
I'M... I'M... I'm sorry, teddy.

11:24.586 --> 11:25.861
I don't want to
screw things up.

11:25.866 --> 11:28.830
- Well, then go home.
- Right.

11:28.848 --> 11:30.453
Nice to meet you, rose.

11:30.467 --> 11:32.383
Enchant?

11:36.228 --> 11:39.841
Boy, if he was 30 years younger,
I'd be following him.

11:41.508 --> 11:43.982
Oh, what the hell?

11:54.997 --> 11:58.173
You were with her, weren't you?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.762
What are you, my wife?

12:01.905 --> 12:05.593
No, I'm the wedding planner.

12:07.105 --> 12:10.201
I'm the one who's dealing
with caterers and florists

12:10.216 --> 12:14.690
and musicians and parking valets
and a thousand frozen butterflies.

12:14.707 --> 12:15.853
Frozen butterflies?

12:15.868 --> 12:17.132
Mom wanted butterflies.

12:17.146 --> 12:18.983
What is she gonna do, eat them?

12:18.998 --> 12:20.950
No, you...
You thaw them out during the ceremony,

12:20.966 --> 12:23.481
and when the bride and groom kiss,
they fly away.

12:23.505 --> 12:25.083
Is there still gonna be shrimp?

12:25.098 --> 12:26.540
Yes, there's gonna be shrimp!

12:26.558 --> 12:29.622
Good. I like shrimp.

12:31.005 --> 12:33.153
Charlie, I will not have
you ruin this wedding.

12:33.165 --> 12:35.360
Well, you can relax.

12:35.376 --> 12:36.751
I wasn wititcourtney.

12:36.766 --> 12:37.970
Thank god for that.

12:37.986 --> 12:40.312
So where were you?

12:40.326 --> 12:43.111
Parked outside her apartment.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.662
You were stalking her?

12:46.675 --> 12:50.812
Oh, man,
why does everybody use that word?

12:51.347 --> 12:54.041
It has such a bad connotation.

12:54.057 --> 12:55.151
Charlie, what is
wrong with you?

12:55.187 --> 12:56.571
I've never seen you
like this before.

12:56.605 --> 12:59.361
I know, I know.

12:59.726 --> 13:01.850
I can't get her out of my mind.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.890
I go to sleep thinking about her.
I wake up thinking about her.

13:04.905 --> 13:07.050
The other day,
I stumble into a three-way and...

13:07.075 --> 13:09.381
Wait, wait...
hey, whoa, whoa...

13:11.548 --> 13:13.781
How do you stumble
into a three-way?

13:13.797 --> 13:16.633
It's usually a roommate thing.

13:16.648 --> 13:20.351
You read about sisters,
but that almost never happens.

13:20.837 --> 13:25.991
Anyway, in order to get through it, I
had to fantasize that both of them
were courtney.

13:26.007 --> 13:27.681
How sad is that?

13:27.698 --> 13:30.210
I'm brokenhearted for you.

13:31.586 --> 13:32.983
You know what I think?

13:32.997 --> 13:36.933
I think the only reason you're so
obsessed with courtney is because you
can't have her.

13:36.947 --> 13:39.071
Well, duh.

13:39.456 --> 13:41.802
Oh, please tell me
you're not calling her.

13:41.818 --> 13:44.261
Of course not.

13:46.965 --> 13:48.760
Hey, rose, it's charlie.

13:48.778 --> 13:52.922
Listen, after you're done with teddy,
can you swing by courtney's and let me
know what she's doing?

14:00.217 --> 14:02.300
Okay, the vows.

14:02.318 --> 14:04.132
Now, I understand you've
written your own?

14:04.148 --> 14:05.602
First I'm hearing about it.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.392
Oh, forgive me, darling, I...

14:07.426 --> 14:10.772
I took the liberty of
writing both of ours.

14:12.266 --> 14:15.591
I come across kind of fruity,
don't I?

14:15.606 --> 14:17.182
Well, you're in love with me.

14:17.198 --> 14:20.270
Love makes everyone
a little gay.

14:21.256 --> 14:22.962
Terrific.

14:23.526 --> 14:27.473
Please let that be my butterflies.
Please, please, please.

14:28.025 --> 14:31.113
That kid doesn't
need butterflies.

14:32.126 --> 14:34.102
Hi, courtney, come on in.

14:34.117 --> 14:36.853
No, that's okay.
I just need to talk to my father.

14:36.865 --> 14:38.483
What's up, baby?

14:38.497 --> 14:40.590
Is courtney here?

14:42.765 --> 14:44.800
Hi, courtney.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.060
Hi, charlie.

14:46.076 --> 14:48.240
Dad, it's kinda private.
Can I talk to you outside, please?

14:48.277 --> 14:50.590
Sure. Excuse me.

14:50.606 --> 14:54.880
Did you happen to see a
frozen butterfly truck go by?

14:55.356 --> 14:56.083
Everything okay?

14:56.097 --> 14:58.403
No, no, everything is not okay.

14:58.415 --> 15:00.650
Always good to see you.

15:01.355 --> 15:04.392
- I just don't under dstan why you won't help me!
- Damn it, courtney. We've been through this!

15:04.506 --> 15:06.240
I'm not gonna keep
bailing you out.

15:06.255 --> 15:08.410
- But daddy, I...
- Don't "but daddy" me!

15:08.427 --> 15:12.582
Wow, makes you feel grateful that
the three of us get along so well.

15:13.385 --> 15:14.871
Courtney: Well, what am I supposed
to do? Li ve on the street?

15:14.908 --> 15:16.820
Teddy: You're supposed to
live within your means.

15:16.836 --> 15:18.901
Courtney: Oh, so you're just gonna turn
your back on me, your own daughter?

15:18.935 --> 15:20.221
Teddy: Oh,
don't be such a drama queen!

15:20.258 --> 15:22.302
Courtney: You know what?
Forget it! I'm outta here.

15:22.315 --> 15:25.402
Teddy: Courtney,
don't be like that.

15:28.998 --> 15:30.710
Okay, the butterflies.

15:31.325 --> 15:34.340
Um, now... now, mom, when you kiss
teddy, they're gonna be released on
the deck,

15:34.375 --> 15:39.333
but just so you know, there's a 50-50
chance that seagulls will swoop down and
rip them to shreds.

15:44.237 --> 15:45.921
I'm sorry you heard that.

15:45.935 --> 15:47.910
Do you want me to talk to her?

15:47.926 --> 15:50.210
No, no, leave it alone.

15:50.247 --> 15:52.411
I'll go talk to her.

15:55.476 --> 16:00.233
Would either of you care to explain
why he's going to talk to her?

16:00.535 --> 16:02.880
- No.
- No.

16:08.506 --> 16:10.172
What are you doing here?

16:10.187 --> 16:13.610
I was concerned about you.
I thought maybe I could help.

16:14.145 --> 16:16.201
You can't help me.

16:16.968 --> 16:19.150
Try me.

16:21.456 --> 16:24.420
I was looking at
the wrong window.

16:26.197 --> 16:27.321
What?

16:27.336 --> 16:29.623
Nice place.

16:32.308 --> 16:35.613
So... what's going on?

16:35.627 --> 16:37.922
What do you want me
to tell you, charlie?

16:37.938 --> 16:41.001
I lost my job;
I'm about to lose my condo;

16:41.016 --> 16:44.602
and my father won't lift
a finger to help me.

16:45.975 --> 16:47.883
How much do you need?

16:47.895 --> 16:50.432
Forget it.
I can't take your money.

16:51.317 --> 16:54.493
Well, I hadn't
actually offered yet.

16:55.216 --> 17:00.140
But we are gonna be family,
and family looks after each other.

17:00.166 --> 17:03.712
I need $50, 000.

17:06.276 --> 17:09.261
How about if I
talk to your dad?

17:09.577 --> 17:11.340
It's no use.

17:11.356 --> 17:14.051
He's trying to
teach me a lesson.

17:14.065 --> 17:18.561
And, uh, you know,
I just love this place so much.

17:20.166 --> 17:23.471
I put every dime I had into it.

17:25.347 --> 17:28.641
Charlie, what am I gonna do?

17:29.147 --> 17:32.641
You're gonna take
the money from me.

17:32.656 --> 17:36.052
No, no, it wouldn't be right.

17:36.067 --> 17:39.053
I insist.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.733
I promise I'll pay you back.

17:46.745 --> 17:48.821
I know you will.

17:48.837 --> 17:53.611
Thank you... so much.

18:00.926 --> 18:04.153
No, no. No, that'S...
that's not why I'm doing this.

18:04.167 --> 18:08.012
I know. I know, but I want you.

18:09.935 --> 18:15.403
I want you, too, but I don't want to
feel like we're doing this because I
lent you money.

18:15.415 --> 18:19.801
Okay, okay. But soon?

18:20.376 --> 18:23.461
Definitely soon.

18:30.545 --> 18:33.262
- Good night.
- Good night.

18:37.156 --> 18:40.641
Ah, hell, if you're okay with it,
I'm okay with it.

18:45.577 --> 18:48.721
I promise to honorand
cherish you,

18:48.737 --> 18:52.100
to always be there for
you as a trusted friend,

18:52.116 --> 18:56.171
devoted husband
and selfish lover.

18:56.768 --> 18:58.691
Selfless.

18:58.708 --> 19:01.031
Oh, right, selfless.

19:02.525 --> 19:06.693
Teddy: And even though I am
significantly older than you...

19:07.785 --> 19:11.322
I feel renewed and
replenished every time

19:11.336 --> 19:14.841
I drink the sweet
nectar of your youth.

19:14.857 --> 19:18.480
Pick it up, teddy.
No one can see butterflies in the dark.

19:20.436 --> 19:25.971
I remember the first time I laid eyes on
you at one of the many charity evts to

19:25.987 --> 19:29.980
which you so tirelessly
devote yourself.

19:29.996 --> 19:35.540
You were a vision in dolce
& gabbana and compassion.

19:35.558 --> 19:38.291
And that first moment we spoke,

19:38.307 --> 19:41.653
the simple melody of your
voice was testimony to

19:41.666 --> 19:47.882
how much the world lost when you gave
up a very promising singing career...

19:49.267 --> 19:54.552
In order to raise your two little boys,
not that they ever appreciated it.

19:57.147 --> 19:59.352
And the lovemaking.

19:59.367 --> 20:03.170
What can I say about
the lovemaking?

20:03.665 --> 20:05.743
I can't say this.

20:05.757 --> 20:08.970
If you don't, I will.

20:12.298 --> 20:18.312
As I explored every inch of your firm,
non-surgically enhanced body...

20:19.246 --> 20:24.402
I finally learned the meaning of
the words, "heaven on earth"...

20:25.068 --> 20:27.382
And "natural redhead. "

20:33.556 --> 20:39.083
In the words of the bard: "Shall I
compare thee to the summer's day?

20:39.417 --> 20:42.563
"Thou art more lovely
"and more temperate.

20:42.577 --> 20:46.863
"Rough winds do shake the
darling buds of may, "

20:46.878 --> 20:51.770
and summer's lease "hath
all too short a date. "

20:52.406 --> 20:56.330
"so long as men can breathe,
"our eyes can see.

20:56.348 --> 21:01.592
"So long lives this "and
gives life to thee. "

21:02.465 --> 21:05.432
You may now kiss the bride.

21:17.556 --> 21:21.140
You want me to sweep them up
and pop them in the microwave?

21:24.127 --> 21:25.460
