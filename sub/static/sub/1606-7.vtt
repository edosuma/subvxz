01:21.480 --> 01:23.642
Yo, shouldn't we be putting filters in these?

01:23.720 --> 01:25.609
Filters?
Where we at, the country club?

01:25.680 --> 01:29.685
Ooh, why don't we give 'em out
with cigarette holders and fur coats like Cruella?

01:29.760 --> 01:32.240
And Holly Golightly.
She had a tiara.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.523
Put filters in, you gotta roll
the cigarettes bigger to match.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.840
Eats into our margins.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.844
You talkin' 'bout chargin'
a book of stamps per.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.524
You got pretty good margins already.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.523
That's like nine bucks a smoke.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.568
Oh, shit, looks like Watson...

01:45.640 --> 01:48.530
is gettin' introduced to our good friends
supply and demand.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.204
Cheese it. The fuzz.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.728
Would you clean a sink
with a piece of raw meat?

01:53.840 --> 01:55.649
No, you wouldn't, because of germs.

01:55.760 --> 01:59.560
A filthy sponge
is like a rectangle of smelly meat.

01:59.680 --> 02:03.162
Studies show that bathroom sinks
have more germs in it than a toilet.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.004
- You gotta disinfect!
- Disinfect.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.924
You know what else has more germs
than a toilet? Your mouth.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.607
And also ATM keypads and the bottom
of ladies' handbags. I read that.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.207
You know, we learn something new
every day here in prison.

02:26.120 --> 02:29.363
All right, listen up, ladies.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.807
If a customer's got regular stamps
and forever stamps...

02:31.920 --> 02:33.763
you always take the forever stamps.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.771
You hold on to those, and when the post office
jacks up the prices, you've made money.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.330
You mean you made money.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.085
You taking, like, 90%, ain't you?

02:42.160 --> 02:45.721
Sendin' those stamps outside,
your boys turn 'em into bank.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.529
I'm the one assuming the risk.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.924
Uh, what about my risk of sitting in Seg
till I start talkin' to my hand?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.764
You want zero percent, walk away.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.163
This is about more than
just a business, ladies.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.124
This is about
making something of yourselves.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.811
You give those women something they want...

03:02.880 --> 03:04.962
they will respect you for it.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.290
Yeah.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.249
- I'm done.
- That's very good.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.448
- Give them to Taystee.
- But they're mine.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.364
We had this talk, Suzanne. Remember?

03:14.440 --> 03:16.044
We each have skills.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.441
Salesmanship?
Not one of yours.

03:20.120 --> 03:23.761
Gotta make people feel more comfortable.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.922
Yo, Vee, where we supposed
to keep all of these?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.651
'Cause a sister
is not tryin' to go to SHU.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.610
You got some kind of invisibility cloak
or somethin'?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.603
You could say that.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.244
Am I asking too much here?

03:42.320 --> 03:44.766
Am I putting something on you people...

03:44.840 --> 03:47.411
that you physically can't do...

03:47.480 --> 03:50.689
like dance the tango or something?

03:50.760 --> 03:54.526
No. I'm asking for competence.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.685
For starters, keeping the prisoners in prison.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.450
Seems pretty simple to me.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.366
Not having a fruitcake in khakis
wander around in public...

04:04.440 --> 04:06.124
five officers hustling her out...

04:06.200 --> 04:09.010
putting her in a car
like some kind of fucking clown show.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.809
- I'm talkin' to you, Bennett.
- You left me here alone.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.803
- That is false.
- I was here.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.201
Yeah, you were patrolling
a copy of <i>Bassmaster</i> magazine.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.204
I'm just- I'm just saying, respectfully...

04:18.320 --> 04:22.041
that maybe Valentine's wasn't the best day to
take a bunch of people to see your gig at a bar.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.043
It's not like people
haven't gotten out before.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.088
Take her to max,
stick a few years on her sentence.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.124
The woman's a hundred years old.
We're gonna give her more time?

04:29.200 --> 04:32.170
Bell, I want you all over that inmate
like a fly on shit.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.289
You follow her.
You find out how she's running.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.011
- How about we just ask her?
- I already did.

04:38.080 --> 04:42.130
She told me she took the trolley
from 27th Street.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.329
I will deal with this officially
when we get the hole plugged up.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.610
You want me 'round the clock
babysittin' Phyllis Diller?

04:49.680 --> 04:54.083
Let me know if that is a waste
of your talents and education.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.290
Second- shot quota. We are
gonna straighten things up around here.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.370
I want each of you writing
five shots a week minimum.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.761
Keep these ladies on point.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.968
- And for you, it's six.
- That's not fair.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.931
I asked you to toughen up your game.
I don't see you gettin' there.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.162
Gonna be such a bitch, Caputo.
The paperwork alone.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.163
Tell it to your mom.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.925
Maybe she'll write you a fuckin' note.
Get out.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.042
<i>Resume normal program.</i>

05:25.120 --> 05:27.851
Inmate. You're late for count.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.048
- I got 45 seconds still.
- Not enough time to get there.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.681
- What is this, <i>The Minority Report?</i>
- Sorry. Gonna write you a shot.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.366
What you- White Cindy
ain't gonna make it either.

05:36.480 --> 05:40.371
- I ain't looking at White Cindy.
- This is some racism right here!

05:40.440 --> 05:42.966
It's not. But it's about to be
if you don't shut up.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.610
What the hell that even mean?

05:45.440 --> 05:47.647
- Get down on the ground, inmate.
- Fucking kidding me?

05:47.720 --> 05:50.041
What'd I just say?

05:51.520 --> 05:53.648
<i>All right, let's move it, people.</i>

05:53.720 --> 05:56.963
<i>And take your shoes off.
I don't even know why I even got to say it.</i>

05:57.600 --> 05:59.170
Oh! Excuse me.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.207
I'm gonna need you
to throw out that soda.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.363
- I'm still drinking it.
- You still drinkin' it?

06:06.280 --> 06:09.443
That's what the terrorists say.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.363
You a terrorist?

06:11.440 --> 06:13.647
Throw it out!

06:13.720 --> 06:17.202
Come on, people. Let's move it.
Let's go. You, come on.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.203
Oh, yeah!

06:19.280 --> 06:20.964
- Watch it, lady.
- Move out the way!

06:21.040 --> 06:23.247
Airport emergency.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.444
Got it!

06:36.300 --> 06:44.300
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

06:46.000 --> 06:49.129
Oh, yeah.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.369
Ooh. Jackpot, baby.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.891
Oh, girl. I got, like, 11 of those.
That one's supposed to be waterproof.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.201
Let me tell you, girl.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.966
You get some crunk juice
on that shit- not good.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.010
Mmm.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.010
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.726
Looks like we got a problem here.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.962
I'm clean.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.088
Technically, yes.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.482
But I can't let you on the plane
with these guns.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.164
Turn around.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.443
I was surprised to get your note.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.443
To be honest,
Larry wasn't all that cooperative.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.360
Well, Larry is in a weird place these days,
which is mostly... my fault.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.960
- But I can't get into that.
- It's none of my business.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.522
I'm just glad they let me in.
Sometimes the inefficiency works for you.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.284
Here's the thing.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.603
My grandmother is very sick,
and I'm supposed to get furlough...

07:51.680 --> 07:53.648
but it doesn't seem to be happening.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.722
I'm not sure where I come in.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.451
Just one example
of how the prison system isn't working.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.445
Guard misconduct,
overuse of solitary confinement.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.808
People on the outside
should know what it's like.

08:05.920 --> 08:09.447
Piper, prison treats inmates unfairly.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.126
If not getting a weekend off to visit
the family is the worst that's happened-

08:12.200 --> 08:13.725
I didn't even remotely say-

08:13.800 --> 08:16.929
Inmates are starving.
They're getting raped.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.129
And it's not like no one's covering this.
It's just that no one cares.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.971
Listen, do I lie awake fantasizing
about personally taking down an institution...

08:25.040 --> 08:27.168
that is the single greatest stain...

08:27.240 --> 08:29.402
on the American collective conscience
since slavery...

08:29.480 --> 08:32.006
with the awesome power of my words?

08:32.080 --> 08:36.448
Sure. But in the daytime,
I've accepted that's not gonna happen.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.408
What I can do, maybe...

08:39.480 --> 08:42.484
is find $2 million
that's gone off the books here at Litchfield.

08:43.640 --> 08:44.971
What do you want me to do?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.520
If money's being appropriated,
it has to be going somewhere.

08:47.600 --> 08:52.208
I'm guessing that there's some kind
of shell corporation it's being paid into.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.931
There is something going on
with the electrical grid.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.923
Well, Figueroa's
the official on the ground here...

08:57.000 --> 09:00.846
which means that she's either
being duped or she's in on the profits.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.365
I need to know...

09:02.440 --> 09:05.808
who she's making contracts with for labor,
supplies, who she's writing checks to.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.644
Okay, cool, I'll just look that up...

09:07.720 --> 09:11.486
in the handy inmate Internet they give us
for when we get curious about stuff.

09:11.560 --> 09:15.929
They appropriated $200,000 last year
to renovate a gym that doesn't exist.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.402
Look, I would love to help you.
I really would.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.245
But short of breaking into Fig's office
and going through her files...

09:22.320 --> 09:24.402
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.687
I have been thrown in SHU twice already...

09:26.760 --> 09:29.491
and I love my grandmother,
and she could die.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.770
I'm not gonna fuck things up for myself
by playing high-stakes Harriet the Spy.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.162
Okay. Let me know
if you change your mind.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.202
I'm sorry about your grandmother.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.963
You sure you just want the usual?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.963
That's why it's called the usual.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.647
I mean, you're running the kitchen now.
You got room for a statement.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.202
What, should I dye my hair fuchsia?

10:00.280 --> 10:03.489
It's auburn.
But not for you.

10:03.560 --> 10:08.930
I think a nice faux-hawk will give
that “Don't fuck with me” vibe. You know?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.128
I mostly use my face for that.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.851
Hey, Aqua Net.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.571
Red said to tell you
she's got violets growing.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.087
- And I should give a shit about this why?
- She said you'd wanna know.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.242
She can grow whatever she wants.
I don't give a-

10:23.320 --> 10:26.085
- Violets.
- Oh.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.243
You're right.
I'll come check that out.

10:31.880 --> 10:35.726
Every day in this place,
I get more confused.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.402
Did you bring the stamps?

10:51.480 --> 10:55.121
Why don't you first tell me what I'm
supposed to be so hair-on-fire excited about.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.040
Man, look, I appreciate your concern...

11:02.120 --> 11:05.010
but I'm actually well covered
on the menstruation front.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.923
Just take one.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.762
Hail Mary, full of grace.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.923
How the hell am I supposed to light this?
Rub two sticks together?

11:33.200 --> 11:36.682
Behold the Litchfield lighter.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.762
Get the fuck out.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.208
Man, it's like the third-best day
of my entire life.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.964
Man, blow into the drain!

12:00.080 --> 12:02.401
What happened was
the critic changed his mind...

12:02.480 --> 12:05.131
because the rat made stew,
and it was delicious.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.884
I understand that.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.770
But that doesn't mean
the rat can open a restaurant.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.448
- The health code is still the health code.
- It's like you're dead inside.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.204
I heard something about violets?

12:16.280 --> 12:17.486
Close the door.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.365
It is a mystery to me
how you people ever lost the Cold War.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.811
But wait.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.043
This covers this.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.569
You ever been kissed
by a six-foot, black, transgender woman?

12:52.640 --> 12:56.440
I'm good, thanks.
But my commissary could use some love.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.364
What ever happened to goods for services?

13:00.440 --> 13:03.046
I'm running a little dry
in the cash department.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.009
You got a steady channel, I assume?

13:05.080 --> 13:08.766
Whatever you want.
Within reason.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.564
I'll be back.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.770
You cannot be serious.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.809
Flores!

13:51.920 --> 13:53.445
Flores!

14:02.160 --> 14:05.243
Bunch of Latinas can't make decent
rice and beans. What's wrong with this picture?

14:05.320 --> 14:07.243
I grew up eating Chinese.

14:07.320 --> 14:11.291
My stepdad from then was Chen Dong.
He had so much dandruff.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.331
It's that black pepper, the shit that comes
in boxes. Tastes like my <i>abuela's</i> ashes.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.889
<i>Soy yo</i> okay,
but you gotta put Cholula on it.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.049
- Kinda busy right now.
- Sorry. Should I-

14:24.120 --> 14:25.645
- Santa!
- Ooh!

14:26.360 --> 14:30.081
Fuck Santa. Bennett's better looking,
and he shows up even if you've been naughty.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.927
- What'd you get?
- Oh, these things just keep getting smaller.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.924
That's actually mine. You can borrow it
a few days, but I'm gonna need it back.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.082
It's full of Fleet Foxes and shit.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.208
- What about my phone?
- Blanca, be real.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.521
This is the last time I can do this.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.888
- I want porn.
- Oh, man!

14:48.960 --> 14:51.804
- Flores is a fucking genius!
- Okay, but good porn.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.803
None of that weird Japanese bullshit.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.929
And I want a magazine with just guys in it.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.289
What? It's hot.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.887
And plus, I don't want to be exploiting
women and shit. It sucks out all the sexy.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.930
- I'm not buying gay porn.
- You homophobic or something?

15:07.000 --> 15:10.527
<i>Suficiente,</i> everyone!
We got hungry people out there. <i>¡Vamos!</i>

15:11.240 --> 15:13.163
I may starve to death.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.561
I'm a vegetarian, obviously.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.883
And I respect that,
but under the present circumstances...

15:18.960 --> 15:20.928
I'm pretty sure that even-

15:21.000 --> 15:23.970
even Paul McCartney
would be all up in a tuna casserole.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.964
Look. That salad bar?
It's just frozen peas and iceberg lettuce.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.769
I need nuts. I need legumes.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.410
Hey, Chapman?

15:30.480 --> 15:33.165
You think me and Gonzales
could help you with that newsletter thing?

15:33.240 --> 15:36.244
- Yeah, sure. That-That would be great.
- Okay.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.411
This might be weird, but, um...

15:41.520 --> 15:43.966
do you know anything
about the kitchen vendors?

15:44.040 --> 15:47.601
- Like which company delivers the groceries?
- Some guys in a truck.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.808
- Soso?
- No.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.723
Pigs are smarter than dogs.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.770
- Do you eat eggs?
- Depends on how they were raised.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.443
- So, no.
- Make fun of me if you want...

15:58.560 --> 16:01.131
but the agribusiness complex
in this country is completely-

16:01.200 --> 16:02.850
Bitch, look around you.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.082
We in the prison-business complex.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.448
A cow breaks me out of here,
I'll stop eating meat that day.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.289
Is it true...

16:11.360 --> 16:13.283
that the Catholic priests in Africa...

16:13.360 --> 16:17.570
are allowed to get married
because chastity's just too hard for them?

16:18.480 --> 16:21.609
- I think it's hard for anyone.
- Yeah, but African men?

16:22.360 --> 16:24.931
That's a whole other story.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.006
I'll take your word for it.
Excuse me.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.250
Sister, the corn bread.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.449
Oh, it's that darn blood sugar thing.
You remember.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.602
I'm gonna have to write you a shot.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.049
You give a shot to a nun?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.209
Don't hate me.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.248
I've never gotten a shot before.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.328
It's the end of days.
I'm telling you.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.324
Okay.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.569
- Can I help with this?
- Oh.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.329
Thank you, Roberta.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.444
You're welcome.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.964
I saw my husband last night.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.646
Well, that sounds lovely.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.483
He plays the bass now.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.883
- Don't forget to shine those shoes.
- I said I'd clean your bunk.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.883
The shoes are not included.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.965
I ain't saying I'm no scientist or nothin',
but the shoes in the bunk. Correct?

17:41.080 --> 17:44.209
Look, I'm gonna get a shot
for even being in here.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.170
If I have to go in front of
the disciplinary board one more time-

17:52.240 --> 17:54.891
You know, karma-wise,
your people had this coming.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.440
Okay, yo.
Here's what I got.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.805
On, hold up.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.565
I specifically said strawberry.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.325
Well, we're out of strawberry right now.
That's the best I could do.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.488
All I know is...

18:14.520 --> 18:16.249
I'm holding some premium shit here.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.084
Bitch, I don't even smoke, okay?

18:18.200 --> 18:22.524
I need it to bribe Aleida to let me borrow
her stinger so I can wax my mustache.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.165
Guess you caught me in a soft mood.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.810
Happy birthday, baby.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.645
- Say “thank you” to your sister.
- Thank you!

18:32.600 --> 18:34.523
It's been a while since we saw you.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.366
You know, things been real busy at work,
but I wouldn't go missing Shorty's birthday.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.125
- Shit!
- Monica.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.884
Sorry.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.724
Bring it here. Uh! Uh!

18:48.400 --> 18:50.880
What?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.644
A little much for a nine-year-old.

18:52.720 --> 18:55.849
If you mean a little much swagger,
you got that right!

18:55.920 --> 18:58.287
I wish you were here for all my birthdays.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.283
Last year, Mom got me clothes.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.089
It's what you needed, baby.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.727
Hey, how about we go
for some ice cream, you and me?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.564
Dinner is in a few hours.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.210
It's a special occasion.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.328
- What flavor you want?
- Bubble gum!

19:11.400 --> 19:14.643
- How 'bout we all go together?
- What you so nervous about?

19:14.720 --> 19:17.530
What you think-
I met you yesterday?

19:17.600 --> 19:19.921
Look, I'm gonna look out for her.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.651
- I promise.
- She promised, Mom.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.331
Go ahead.
But leave that iPad here.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.131
I don't want you losin' it or gettin' it stolen.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.929
Let's blow this joint!

19:33.680 --> 19:36.411
- Cindy.
- I know.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.089
Hey, uh, Chapman...

19:58.160 --> 20:01.926
I-I was just wondering
if maybe y-you got any room...

20:02.000 --> 20:06.324
on your newsletter committee
th-that maybe I could join up?

20:06.400 --> 20:07.731
Let me see.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.963
So far it's me and two Spanish girls,
one of whom scares me a bit.

20:11.040 --> 20:14.203
So, yeah.
Yeah, I think I can squeeze you in.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.169
Oh, that's really good.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.323
Is there anything in particular
that you want to write about?

20:19.400 --> 20:22.244
Uh, I didn't really get that far.

20:22.320 --> 20:25.483
I just thought it'd be good
to keep busy, you know?

20:26.040 --> 20:30.204
Well, what about romance?
Like a serial type of thing?

20:30.280 --> 20:31.884
Dickens meets Danielle Steel.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.050
I'm trying to stay away
from the romance-type stuff...

20:36.120 --> 20:37.645
just for a little while.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.051
Oh.

20:39.120 --> 20:42.090
Oh, yeah.
No, it's- it's fine. It's just-

20:42.160 --> 20:43.844
Maybe something else.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.647
It's fucked up, isn't it,
how we're stuck in here...

20:48.720 --> 20:51.166
and the world outside
just keeps turning?

20:51.920 --> 20:53.524
Yeah.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.091
What about a beauty column?

20:57.160 --> 20:59.049
You always look so nice.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.720
Well, you know,
just 'cause you're in prison...

21:02.800 --> 21:04.768
don't mean you gotta let it go.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.525
I bet that you have some great tips.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.443
Okay.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.561
Okay. I can do it.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.290
I can do that.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.886
Thank you, Chapman.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.050
<i>Dr. Cole, please call psych ward.</i>

21:24.760 --> 21:27.081
- Hey, you got a fag?
- A what?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.889
A fag.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.440
You know. A drag? A butt?

21:31.560 --> 21:32.891
A burn.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.009
You talking about cigarettes,
you're at the wrong house.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.364
I'm not the one who started
a Negro-league tobacco shack.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.569
That would be your pal Vee. I merely
seek to avail myself of her fine product.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.405
- She ain't my pal.
- She's pals with your pals.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.405
Right, or she's using them to do
her dirt while she counts the cash.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.960
You ain't gonna find her hands
on no contraband.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.003
You watch,
somebody goes down for carrying...

21:55.080 --> 21:57.321
she'll be shuffling and smiling
in front of the CO's like...

21:57.400 --> 21:59.482
“Oh, Lord, what did these girls got up to?”

22:07.360 --> 22:10.330
Hey, you know that thing that happens
to lesbians in high school?

22:10.400 --> 22:13.210
How we strike up
a really intense best friendship...

22:13.280 --> 22:15.647
with a straight girl who's really into it.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.690
And we convince ourselves
that friends is good, right?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.762
Until she gets a boyfriend.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.889
We hate that poor asshole
with the white-hot heat of a thousand suns.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.122
“He's not worthy of you” or whatever.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.483
He's probably a decent-enough person,
I mean, as guys go.

22:29.560 --> 22:33.610
Because what's really happening
is that we're in love with our friend.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.204
Why does everybody think
I'm in love with her? 'Cause I'm not.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.011
Sure.
Sure. Let's go with that.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.241
But in the event that you
were having the feels for her...

22:46.320 --> 22:49.290
turns out that by hating her boyfriend,
you're just gonna drive her away.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.284
You've gotta suck it up
and make him like you.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.762
Take up poker,
watch <i>The Godfather</i> 10 times, or whatever.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.923
<i>All clear, everybody. We found it.</i>

22:59.000 --> 23:02.083
Anyway, it's your life.
Spend it how you want, all right?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.765
<i>Ay,</i> where's your sack, Santa?

23:14.240 --> 23:15.924
Couldn't do it.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.522
- I'm not doing this anymore.
- I think you forgot how blackmail works, <i>papi.</i>

23:19.600 --> 23:23.207
I think you forgot how prison works.
This shit has gone too far.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.602
You know who else went too far?
You with Dayanara.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.330
Fine.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.165
How about this?
You're all getting shots.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.925
- I didn't do nothing, asshole.
- Well, that sucks for you.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.446
- You got to be fucking kidding me, right?
- I promise you, I'm not kidding.

23:37.560 --> 23:41.565
Hey, Bennett, what's gonna happen
when Caputo finds out you raped an inmate?

23:41.640 --> 23:43.449
- He's not gonna find out.
- You sure about that?

23:43.520 --> 23:45.522
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
'cause you're going to the SHU.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.365
- For what?
- I'll figure it out later.

23:48.440 --> 23:51.922
- You ain't gonna do that to me.
- You think I'm not? Let's go.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.205
Move it!

23:54.280 --> 23:56.681
- Shit!
- You want to join her?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.804
Bye.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.884
- I heard you wanted to see me?
- Oh, Chapman. Right. Come in.

24:15.680 --> 24:19.571
Mr. Caputo, have you, um,
heard anything about my furlough request?

24:19.640 --> 24:22.484
It's not my department. Sorry.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.086
But I've been thinking
about this newsletter.

24:25.720 --> 24:26.767
Awesome.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.367
Been thinking it could be
a good way for us- the administration-

24:30.440 --> 24:34.604
to communicate with the inmates,
explain our side of things.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.609
Your side of what?

24:38.680 --> 24:41.206
For instance, this shot-quota thing
we got going.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.801
You ladies think we're being mean.
But we're just doing our job.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.083
Things get out of hand,
it's bad for everybody.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.082
That's kind of what fascists say.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.405
I may be related to Mussolini
on my mother's side.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.849
It's a joke.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.890
Maybe you could put something
in the newsletter about the guards.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.962
Show everybody we're human.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.088
“Guards. They're just like us.”

25:09.120 --> 25:10.849
I wouldn't go that far.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.251
How about... “Guards.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.289
They're people too.”

25:19.440 --> 25:21.283
So, uh...

25:23.600 --> 25:28.447
tell me... what do you like to do
in your spare time?

25:39.360 --> 25:41.249
Hi- Ow!

25:41.320 --> 25:43.288
- What is the matter with you?
- So much.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.567
You show up at my house
like fucking Squiggy with a hard-on.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.007
Maybe next time you decide to make
some deranged declaration of love...

25:48.080 --> 25:50.003
to an emotional zombie
with a blocked milk duct...

25:50.080 --> 25:52.686
and a husband who recently purchased
an Aleutian hunting spear...

25:52.760 --> 25:54.330
you could consider calling first.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.483
Okay, look, Polly,
I am spiraling out. Okay?

25:57.560 --> 26:00.564
I am. I-I-I- You know,
you have this idea of what your life is-

26:00.640 --> 26:02.404
I can't do this, Larry!

26:02.480 --> 26:04.209
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.567
- It's just stupid.
- I know.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.883
I mean, yes, we were friends before we
even started dating Pete and Piper...

26:09.960 --> 26:12.281
and, yes, you drove me to the hospital
when I was in labor...

26:12.360 --> 26:14.488
and handled all the paperwork
and the nurses...

26:14.560 --> 26:17.609
and, yes, you were the only one there for me
when my husband checked out of fatherhood...

26:17.720 --> 26:19.927
so he could go on a month-long mission
of self-exploration...

26:20.000 --> 26:24.289
and you're funny, but also boring
in all the right ways, and-

26:24.360 --> 26:26.727
What the hell am I saying?
Just fuck me.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.571
- I don't- I don't know what this means.
- Shut up.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.924
Okay, listen. Listen.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.889
I haven't had sex in months...

26:37.960 --> 26:39.928
so there's
a better-than-average chance that I-

26:40.000 --> 26:41.365
Shut the fuck up, Larry.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.202
Did you say something
about a blocked milk duct?

26:49.280 --> 26:50.645
Just stay to the right.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.964
It's like sending a letter.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.771
There's a box, you type in a question
and the answer comes up.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.808
Who's on the other end looking it up?

27:00.880 --> 27:04.885
Nobody. It's in the wires.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.646
It's all the information in the world.

27:08.720 --> 27:13.408
You're telling me
all the information in the world is in wires?

27:14.920 --> 27:17.048
But people are still stupid, right?

27:19.640 --> 27:23.440
Hey, Red, I could, uh,
really use some matches.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.931
- Matches.
- Yeah.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.490
Good.

27:26.560 --> 27:31.248
I was just thinking our chances of dying
in some nut-job arsonist's fire bomb...

27:31.320 --> 27:33.243
weren't high enough already.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.641
I won't let anyone else touch 'em.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.882
Come on. I'm just trying
to get my smoke on.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.529
And what exactly are you smoking?

27:43.440 --> 27:45.044
The black girls got cigs.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.645
If you need muscle,
Taslitz killed a guy with an ax.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.927
That was before the arthritis.

27:52.160 --> 27:56.961
Boo, much as I'd like to help you
spend the rest of your life in solitary...

27:57.040 --> 27:58.690
I'm busy.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.765
Come back later, and I'll see about
getting you some cookies or something.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.884
Oh, man.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.409
That's a shot, inmate.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.051
- For what?
- Damaging government property.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.249
- That is horseshit, and you know it.
- You want one for obscenity too?

28:23.680 --> 28:25.967
So, I'm thinking
that Lorna can be assistant editor...

28:26.040 --> 28:29.283
help us come up with ideas of things
to write about and people to write them.

28:29.360 --> 28:32.603
- So, you got two white girls in charge.
- Ah, shit.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.921
I just think it should be based on
who earned it, is all.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.889
I did yearbook in high school, so-

28:36.960 --> 28:38.962
Yearbook isn't even a real class.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.407
You just take photographs
and smoke weed.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.209
Everybody knows that.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.011
Anyway, I already wrote a column.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.165
Let me see.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.730
Look. I drew this.

28:49.800 --> 28:53.646
It's about being in jail with, like,
animals at the zoo.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.886
Why is the walrus in such a bad mood?

28:58.960 --> 29:01.964
Oh, that's, um, Mr. Healy.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.371
This is fantastic.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.727
- You already made your first mistake.
- Says who?

29:05.800 --> 29:09.247
If you could care less, that means
you still care. You know what I'm saying?

29:09.320 --> 29:11.971
'Cause, like, it is possible
for you to care less.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.566
No, no, I'm saying...

29:14.640 --> 29:18.281
however much you care,
I could care less than you.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.767
That's not what it means.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.605
It should be,
“I <i>couldn't</i> care less.” See?

29:23.680 --> 29:26.604
Because you hit bottom with caring.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.603
Yo, Chapman, tell her.

29:28.680 --> 29:31.206
I mean, technically, yes.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.284
But I think this is
one of those things like- like “literally”...

29:34.360 --> 29:37.409
where the colloquial usage of the word
eventually wins out.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.245
- Languages evolve.
- Why you got to be like that?

29:40.320 --> 29:45.281
Look, the point is,
everybody knows what I'm trying to say.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.887
- Why you gotta be a dick about it?
- It's called grammar, <i>tonta</i>.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.928
I'm so glad I found you, Roberta.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.446
- Are you okay?
- No. I'm being followed.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.530
It's the damn Irish.
I can't go back to the pen.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.409
No touching, Cavanaugh.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.521
Oh, that is so sad.

30:07.960 --> 30:12.887
- What are you gonna write about?
- I was thinking, like, an advice column.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.567
People write about their problems,
and then I tell them to get their shit together.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.722
Mmm. Got a bunch of the baseball ones.
My favorite.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.320
You know I got you covered.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.402
- Cindy.
- Yo.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.005
Got something for me?

30:28.080 --> 30:30.401
So, here's the thing- No.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.684
- Maybe you'd care to explain.
- Not everyone had stamps.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.207
They didn't know you was looking for 'em.
Doesn't mean they shouldn't get a smoke.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.011
Well, actually, that's exactly what it means.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.605
It's called commerce.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.206
Oh, I let 'em trade for it old school.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.290
Like the red man.

30:49.920 --> 30:53.288
Bitch, trust me.
You do not want to short Vee.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.567
She <i>will</i> go Wolverine on your ass.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.404
All right, listen.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.609
I'll sell the next ones for a couple
bucks extra and make up the difference.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.126
If you can't be trusted with the package,
you can't be selling.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.771
- From now on, you're on maintenance.
- What that supposed to mean?

31:06.840 --> 31:08.330
You do what Suzanne's been doing.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.961
You roll smokes for everyone to sell,
package them, sweep up behind.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.644
I ain't doing grunt work.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.882
When you've paid off your debt,
you'll get another chance.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.450
Fuck that.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.563
Take her place...

31:29.640 --> 31:31.085
if you want to.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.804
Uh-

31:34.880 --> 31:36.609
Yeah. I'll think about it.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.923
I ain't scared of you.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.448
Say it, Moni! Say it, M-

32:05.560 --> 32:08.291
- Okay.
- You like them other kids?

32:08.360 --> 32:09.930
They're okay.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.083
Some of them make fun of me,
say I'm a nerd.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.441
And I don't got a cell phone.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.444
They say I must have got named
after that tense girl on Friends.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.090
Man, that's some bullshit.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.447
You was named after Monica
from <i>Love & Basketball...</i>

32:22.520 --> 32:26.605
played by Miss Sanaa Lathan,
who, by the way, is so un-uptight...

32:26.680 --> 32:29.365
she hooked it up with Denzel,
and he married!

32:29.920 --> 32:31.410
Ma says that's a rumor.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.211
It ain't no rumor.
And Ma is boring anyway.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.770
Shit.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.808
Yo! Is that my boy Martin?

32:37.880 --> 32:40.850
- I thought his ass in jail.
- He got out last month.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.524
Watch this.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.487
No way. I'll hit you back.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.486
What you doing here, dog?
I thought your ass was in jail.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.961
Oh, please.
I'm too slick for that shit.

32:52.040 --> 32:55.931
- Hi.
- I got a government job out at Pittsburgh.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.322
Oh, this is crazy. You gotta come upstairs
and say hey to Fozzie.

32:59.400 --> 33:03.200
- Shit. Fozzie around too?
- He's gonna wet himself when he sees you.

33:03.280 --> 33:07.046
I'm gonna go upstairs for 10 minutes.
You stay right here. A'ight?

33:07.120 --> 33:09.691
Hey, hey-
Oh, hold up.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.246
Twenty minutes, tops.
I promise.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.410
Love you.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.528
Yo! Boy, give me some!

33:17.640 --> 33:19.529
- No, bring that shit in.
- Come on, man!

33:19.640 --> 33:23.247
So what'd you end up doing
with all them lightbulbs?

33:35.080 --> 33:36.730
Hey. Wanda.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.770
I, um-

33:46.760 --> 33:48.728
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.723
It's a little late for that.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.121
I screwed up.
Things were just moving so fast.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.125
I'm of an age, Scott.
You gotta shit or get off the pot.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.487
Give me another chance.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.404
I'll move in.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.489
I'll bring the Vitamix and everything.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.121
I miss you.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.650
Come here, Panda.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.521
I missed you too.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.848
I've learned some things about
the female anatomy I think you might enjoy.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.562
What the fuck did you do
to my girl Maritza?

34:53.639 --> 34:56.041
- They were blackmailing me.
- She wasn't gonna say nothing.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.646
You think she's trying to get my baby daddy
locked up so he can't provide?

34:58.720 --> 35:00.449
That's not a risk I can take.

35:00.520 --> 35:04.002
That is my sister in here.
I don't even like the bitch. But she's family.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.963
What am I supposed to do? Tell me.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.527
Am I supposed to let every Spanish girl
around here start pushing me around?

35:09.600 --> 35:10.965
I'm a CO.

35:11.040 --> 35:14.249
What do you think happens when they see me
giving an inmate airplane bottles of Jäger?

35:14.320 --> 35:16.971
Maybe you should have thought of it
when you didn't want to wear a condom. Huh?

35:17.040 --> 35:20.169
“I'm gonna pull out, baby.
It takes too long to come with a rubber.”

35:20.240 --> 35:22.163
- That's not fair, and you know it.
- Fuck you.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.447
I just used obscenity.
You gonna write me a shot?

35:24.520 --> 35:26.409
- Daya, I'm-
- Assaulting an officer.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.409
Write me a shot.

35:28.520 --> 35:31.251
What, pussy?
Come on. Huh?

35:31.320 --> 35:36.326
- I'm not writing you a shot.
- But you could if you wanted to, right?

35:36.400 --> 35:38.448
Because you have a choice.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.761
You have the power.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.002
I'm an inmate.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.731
I have nothing.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.451
Jesus, I hate the elderly.

35:53.520 --> 35:57.081
Ladies and gentlemen,
your next state senator.

35:57.160 --> 36:00.767
You want to talk infrastructure
or flood levels...

36:00.840 --> 36:03.241
or whatever- too bad.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.403
It's the same goddamn question
every time.

36:06.480 --> 36:10.041
No, Andy Rooney, I am not
gonna touch your fucking Medicare.

36:10.120 --> 36:13.442
Say what you got to say.
The geezers vote.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.090
Oh.

36:16.040 --> 36:18.646
Do you think my hair looks too shiny?

36:21.280 --> 36:23.248
Hey, so, <i>City Post</i> is reporting...

36:23.320 --> 36:25.527
Rowley's PAC
just got a major donation...

36:25.600 --> 36:29.730
from, um, what's-his-face,
the golf course guy.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.644
They put it at a million and a half.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.369
Oh, fuck.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.808
I bet Rowley danced like a little monkey whore
for it too, that dick stain.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.761
That's it then. We're fucked.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.204
You can take off, Gavin.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.884
Cool.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.850
Great speech today, sir.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.482
It was very powerful.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.609
Listen, we're not giving up.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.682
We'll figure this out.
We've got options.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.410
I am stressed, babe.

37:07.480 --> 37:10.848
I have this reporter buzzing around Litchfield
like a Bob fucking Woodward.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.843
He's not gonna find anything.
I promise.

37:12.920 --> 37:17.050
Sure, buddy. Let's worry about funding
luxury bathrooms for these ladies.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.043
Dual-action showerheads.
The works.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.327
Don't bother fixing the sentencing laws...

37:21.400 --> 37:24.404
guaranteeing a fair trial for everyone
and a competent lawyer.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.211
- No, no. Let's give them loofahs.
- I know. I know.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.204
People can be so... small.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.328
We're gonna win. I promise.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.562
And then we can get to work...

37:35.640 --> 37:37.847
fixing what's really important.

37:37.920 --> 37:41.083
We're the good guys.
We'll find the money.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.963
We'll get a house in Albany.

37:44.040 --> 37:46.042
Maybe finally have a kid.

37:46.120 --> 37:49.488
If you want to have a kid, you might
actually have to have sex with me.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.283
You know, I'm-

38:00.640 --> 38:03.689
I'm exhausted all the time.
This is so draining.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.041
I know. I'm sorry. I just-

38:08.440 --> 38:11.444
I just want to feel like you want me.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.201
I more than want you, babe.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.210
I <i>need</i> you.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.210
G'day, mate!

38:44.280 --> 38:46.169
I'm just kidding.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.083
Who even says that?

38:48.160 --> 38:50.686
I had to get out of the house for a bit.

38:50.760 --> 38:54.651
Polly has been a pill today.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.842
I watched the baby all afternoon.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.527
I told her to go spin
or whatever it is that she does.

39:01.600 --> 39:06.208
And then when she gets back,
she's in an even weirder mood than before.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.285
Bitches. Am I right?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.482
So, what's up with you, mate?

39:23.440 --> 39:25.920
I'm afraid to get in.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.810
The water is so cold.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.129
You always talk me into things.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.005
All right.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.803
The hell with it.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.962
Here I come!

40:25.560 --> 40:27.528
Get out the tree!

40:29.360 --> 40:32.364
I don't mess with trees, generally.

40:33.520 --> 40:36.524
Why you sneaking around
all stealth and shit?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.523
You ain't the damn Pink Panther.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.969
You're funny, aren't you?

40:42.040 --> 40:44.361
Always joking, always clownin'.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.206
We can't laugh in here,
what else we got?

40:48.280 --> 40:50.442
That's a fair point.

40:50.520 --> 40:54.844
Problem is when jokes are all you've got.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.247
You're like the grasshopper in the story...

40:58.320 --> 41:01.767
living for today, having a fine time.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.764
No responsibilities,
no plans, no ambition.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.764
Carpe diem, right?

41:09.560 --> 41:12.609
Someone even smarter than you said that.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.603
Yeah, well, that probably worked back then...

41:14.680 --> 41:17.889
when folks were expected
to check out before 40.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.324
Thing is...

41:21.400 --> 41:23.767
if you're not building a future...

41:23.840 --> 41:27.003
that's because
you don't believe there is a future.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.084
You've given up on yourself.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.763
You're a loser.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.084
Hmm.

41:48.960 --> 41:51.042
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

41:51.120 --> 41:54.567
I'm up waiting till midnight for you,
no idea where you are.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.563
Everything's cool.
We got held up, is all.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.007
The girl is nine years old.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.929
Her clothes reek of pot smoke.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.570
Oh!

42:02.640 --> 42:05.211
She ain't smoke nothin'.
I ain't no psycho.

42:05.280 --> 42:09.410
This is my fault for letting you take her.

42:09.480 --> 42:12.927
You just jealous 'cause she like me
more than you. Admit it.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.968
Don't you flatter yourself.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.362
She would like anyone who showed up here
every once in a blue moon...

42:18.440 --> 42:21.603
and gave her presents
they didn't even come by honest.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.290
I can do whatever I want
with my own damn daughter.

42:31.720 --> 42:35.088
You lost all right
to call her your daughter...

42:35.160 --> 42:37.049
when you left her here with me.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.168
You think I lost my right?

42:39.240 --> 42:41.368
How 'bout this?

42:41.440 --> 42:44.808
Why don't we tell her the truth
and see who she choose?

42:44.880 --> 42:47.201
Don't you dare do that to her.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.930
She old enough now.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.402
You ain't tellin' her nothin'
and then walk out and leave her.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.927
You want to tell her? Fine.
You go on and tell her.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.844
- But then you got to take her.
- Well, maybe I will.

42:58.920 --> 43:02.083
And what kind of care
you gonna provide for that child?

43:02.160 --> 43:04.640
You gonna pick her up
every day from school?

43:04.720 --> 43:06.643
Take her to her piano class?

43:06.720 --> 43:10.088
You gonna braid her hair,
sit up at nights when she's sick...

43:10.160 --> 43:12.606
clean up her vomit
down on your hands and knees?

43:12.680 --> 43:14.921
- What, you don't think I can do that shit?
- You take her then.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.130
If you think you can do a better job
of raising her than me, be my guest.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.368
Take her! Go!

43:34.000 --> 43:36.287
You have a plant.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.442
For the greenhouse.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.841
It's rosemary from my bush at home.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.287
Grows into a whole new plant.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.371
Anyway...

43:48.560 --> 43:50.528
sorry I had to crack the whip yesterday.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.329
No, it's- It was-

43:52.440 --> 43:54.044
This job may look easy, but-

43:54.120 --> 43:56.043
it isn't.

43:57.680 --> 43:59.284
I got ambition, you know.

43:59.360 --> 44:01.249
I could be warden one day.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.891
This whole shot-quota thing,
who knows if it works?

44:03.960 --> 44:06.486
The people upstairs, they like plans.
They like initiative.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.608
Y-You got to show 'em you're operating.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.209
I understand.

44:11.680 --> 44:14.889
Some people, they got no ambition at all.

44:14.960 --> 44:18.328
They just want to skate by, drink beer...

44:18.400 --> 44:21.449
do as little as possible.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.366
Luschek, for instance.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.964
Luschek's nice.

44:28.720 --> 44:32.088
Sure. If you like that kind of thing.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.162
I like talking to him.

44:34.240 --> 44:37.403
It's nice chatting with someone
who gets what you do all day. You know?

44:37.480 --> 44:39.482
Like work stuff.

44:44.680 --> 44:46.762
Okay.

44:46.840 --> 44:49.446
- Gonna bring this outside.
- See you tomorrow.

45:05.960 --> 45:09.123
- Yo, are you sure about this font?
- Yo. Yo. Really?

45:10.040 --> 45:12.088
Look, Bennett ain't gonna file
the paperwork for Maritza.

45:12.160 --> 45:14.766
He was just trying to teach her a lesson.
She'll be out tomorrow.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.410
I didn't say anything about Maritza.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.164
You're acting like an uptight bitch.

45:18.240 --> 45:21.562
Well, just because you're doing a comic
doesn't mean you have to use comic sans.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.880
- Wha-
- That's stupid.

45:22.960 --> 45:24.530
Hater.

45:24.600 --> 45:27.683
I never would have thought instant coffee
could be used for eye shadow.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.890
Oh, yeah, hon. It tastes like ass,
so it's actually better as a cosmetic.

45:31.960 --> 45:34.486
Who would have thought
that Caputo had a turtle?

45:34.560 --> 45:36.483
I had him pegged as a bird guy.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.324
Madam Editor.
How you doing?

45:39.080 --> 45:41.128
We're actually all assistant editors here.

45:41.200 --> 45:45.285
Oh, you mean like a TV show
with all those names rolling by up front.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.089
Can't all be that important.

45:47.160 --> 45:50.289
I assure you that everyone here
is vital to the operation.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.600
Mm-hmm.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.523
Check this out, Mr. Healy.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.443
What's this?

45:55.520 --> 45:57.090
Comics?

45:58.160 --> 46:00.288
Hey, good artwork.

46:00.400 --> 46:04.086
Hey, Mr. Healy, I was wondering
if you've heard anything about my furlough.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.004
Hey, bureaucracy, you know?
I'll call around and check.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.764
Hey, when did this happen?

46:08.840 --> 46:11.650
Oh, that's just to keep him
off our backs, you know.

46:11.720 --> 46:14.371
- Ego.
- Good thinking, Chapman.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.202
All right, carry on.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.760
That walrus is hilarious.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.930
Give me my shit.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.802
There's more where that came from.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.405
I know.

46:40.480 --> 46:43.211
Because I invented the yogurt thing.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.563
Have some originality, Mendoza, huh?

46:48.000 --> 46:51.163
Okay, I- I didn't ask for any of this.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.882
There's a waiting list,
but I'll see what I can do.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.480
What do you want?

46:59.560 --> 47:01.961
A nice mud mask?

47:02.040 --> 47:03.451
Or is it gum?

47:03.520 --> 47:06.410
Everyone suddenly
seems to want gum for some reason.

47:06.480 --> 47:08.608
They're making lighters with the wrappers.

47:09.960 --> 47:12.645
I don't like this one bit.

47:12.720 --> 47:15.200
Please. She sells her thing.
You sell yours.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.682
- It's no competition.
- Ah.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.445
- So you're on her side.
- No, no, no, no.

47:21.520 --> 47:24.524
I don't want no black market shit.

47:24.600 --> 47:28.446
I want cilantro.
You can grow that in the garden.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.286
Deal.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.127
- Some padrón peppers?
- Don't push it.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.725
But fine.

47:38.960 --> 47:40.928
Fine then.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.609
I'm late for somethin'.

48:29.760 --> 48:32.411
Ha! Boom.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.125
Boom, boom, boom.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.806
You keep taking out
all the targets in front of you.

48:37.880 --> 48:40.281
But you've got to think ahead, Suzanne.

48:40.360 --> 48:42.931
If you move there...

48:45.120 --> 48:47.248
what'll I do?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.762
It's called the long game.

48:54.360 --> 48:55.691
Okay.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.524
Okay, what?

49:00.040 --> 49:02.361
I'll take my medicine.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.530
Give her the bag.

49:13.600 --> 49:15.170
What's this?

49:16.040 --> 49:17.201
Used tampons.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.248
Ugh!

49:19.320 --> 49:23.564
Not the tampons.
Just the tubey parts. From the trash can.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.369
Now you just fuckin' with me.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.926
Tampons cost five dollars
at the commissary.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.446
Used applicators out of the trash-
they're free.

49:30.520 --> 49:33.171
Where do you think
the first batch came from?

49:33.280 --> 49:34.850
Somebody had to do it.

49:34.920 --> 49:36.490
This is disgusting.

49:36.560 --> 49:38.369
Yes, it is.

49:43.560 --> 49:45.608
Great.

49:47.280 --> 49:51.968
<i>Officer Roberts, guard detail, central library.</i>

49:58.120 --> 50:00.885
- I'm thirsty.
- Drink the water I gave you.

50:00.960 --> 50:02.962
But I don't want water.
I want juice.

50:03.040 --> 50:05.122
You're gonna have to wait
till we get through security.

50:05.200 --> 50:07.726
But I'm thirsty <i>now.</i>

50:09.760 --> 50:11.444
Do you have kids?

50:14.080 --> 50:15.445
No.

50:16.200 --> 50:18.043
Thanks. Let's go, baby.

50:21.600 --> 50:24.285
All right. Next, please.

50:30.440 --> 50:33.284
I'm not going.
I'm not going.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.331
I'm not going.

50:35.400 --> 50:39.200
Roberta!
Don't let them take me! Roberta!

50:40.360 --> 50:43.330
Roberta.
I'm not going.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.004
Not going!

50:45.080 --> 50:47.560
Please tell me
that they're taking her to get help.

50:47.640 --> 50:49.722
They're taking her to the bus station.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.451
She thinks that Lyndon Johnson
is president.

50:52.520 --> 50:56.411
She needs full-time care
in a dedicated facility.

50:56.480 --> 50:59.165
- Let go of me!
- They're not gonna pay for that.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.720
What about her family?

51:01.800 --> 51:04.963
She has a daughter in Stockholm.
They don't speak.

51:05.080 --> 51:07.128
So she's out on the street?

51:09.040 --> 51:10.724
It's called...

51:10.800 --> 51:12.768
compassionate release.

51:13.440 --> 51:16.011
Roberta!

51:17.360 --> 51:20.921
Roberta!
