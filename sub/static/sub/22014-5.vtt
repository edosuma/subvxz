They re-created
our living room?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.393
This is crazy!

18:13.426 --> 18:14.394
You know what's crazy?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.496
This whole thing
was only $40!

18:17.864 --> 18:19.566
"Follow the rules".

18:19.599 --> 18:20.833
When do I ever not?

18:20.867 --> 18:22.068
"Do not touch."

18:22.101 --> 18:24.371
So there must be a key
that we can touch.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.006
"Do not touch," "Do not touch,"
"Do not touch."

18:27.039 --> 18:29.176
Loophole --
a grab is not a touch.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.243
No, wait!

18:32.745 --> 18:34.447
Aaaaaah!

18:34.481 --> 18:37.250
Loophole doesn't work,
does it? No.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.051
How does this
not wake me up?!

18:39.085 --> 18:40.520
I'll help you.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.521
Aah!

18:41.554 --> 18:43.290
Ooh! We're supposed to
use the banana

18:43.323 --> 18:44.457
with Ray's severed hand.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.126
The banana's not a clue!
It's my snack!

18:48.828 --> 18:50.663
Oh, well done, darling.
I got the key.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.432
Yes!
Seriously?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.302
Cheating on the puzzle
about following the rules?

18:55.335 --> 18:58.137
Ay yi yi yi yi-yi-yi.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.911
Ray: [ Groans ]
When will this torture end?

19:04.944 --> 19:08.415
Guys, I think we need the key
to open this box.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.882
Oh. The key
from the other room?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.318
Yeah, no,
I lost that ages ago.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.587
Unbelievable. Ugh!

"Dunk a basketball".

19:25.164 --> 19:28.000
"That's impossible.
None of us can do that."

19:28.034 --> 19:29.101
I can dunk.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.169
[ Laughter ]

19:30.203 --> 19:32.539
What? I have ups.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.908
[ Hissing ]

19:35.942 --> 19:37.944
Looks...like
we're being poisoned.

19:37.977 --> 19:38.978
No time to stretch.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.513
Bring in da noise.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.216
Bring in da funk!

19:45.485 --> 19:46.453
"A" for effort.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.487
Aah!

19:47.520 --> 19:50.657
[ Echoing ]
This hole is so deep!

19:50.690 --> 19:52.525
[ Thud ]
Dad's dead!

19:53.526 --> 19:55.094
Stupid banana hand!

19:55.127 --> 19:56.629
Oh, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

19:56.663 --> 19:58.665
but I wish Kenneth was here
to dunk.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.500
Kenneth: Exactly!

20:02.702 --> 20:04.371
Kenneth, what are you
doing here?!

20:05.872 --> 20:07.039
I built this whole place

20:07.073 --> 20:09.776
to teach you
a series of moral lessons.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.512
"Be on time" because
you always make me wait.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.181
"Follow the rules"
because you never do.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.817
And "Dunk a basketball"
because...

20:17.850 --> 20:19.852
I also want to be invited
to escape rooms.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.354
That seems fair,
Kenneth.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.656
Aright, well, let me
get us out of here
before my gas kills us.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.724
Check it.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.227
Aah!

20:28.261 --> 20:29.329
Oh.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.898
Huh.
[ Coughing ]

20:31.931 --> 20:33.165
Guess it's been a while.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.301

20:34.334 --> 20:35.302
Oops.

[ Screams ]

20:37.604 --> 20:40.573
[ Gasping ]

20:40.607 --> 20:42.275
What was with that dream?

20:42.309 --> 20:43.843
I didn't even eat
the old candy.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.413
I just ate what we've been
giving trick-or-treaters.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.215
So, I gave
all those kids...

20:49.248 --> 20:50.216
Oops.

[ Doorbell rings ]

Aaaaah!

20:57.624 --> 20:58.925
[ Chuckles ]

20:58.958 --> 21:01.594
I guess that old candy has
a variety of side effects.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.229
I'll say it does.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.731
Give us a kiss,
Kenneth.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.265
What?

21:06.299 --> 21:07.667
And me, Kenneth.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.636
Yeah, kiss us both
for Halloween.

21:09.669 --> 21:10.737
No.
Kiss us.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.738
No!
Kiss us.

No! Nooooooooo!!

Oh, my God.

is the perfect costume!

Oh, hot tub Halloween nap,
you done done it again.
