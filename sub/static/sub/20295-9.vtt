-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:40.000
in a court of law.

00:42.233 --> 00:45.167
-I've been with Lubbock PD
for just a little over 10 years.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.000
I'm a detective with their
Crime Suppression Unit.

00:48.033 --> 00:51.233
The squad I'm on
deals with kind of, uh,
a little bit of everything.

00:51.267 --> 00:54.000
Uh... it's been a pretty
amazing ride, to tell you
the truth.

00:54.033 --> 00:56.867
Um... it's not something
I initially thought
myself as doing,

00:56.900 --> 01:00.067
but I can't-- I mean
I go to work every day

01:00.100 --> 01:03.267
and I can't believe
that I get paid to do this job.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.567
-Man on radio:
Hey, let me know
'cause I got a violation.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.333
-All right, I'm two cars
behind you here.

01:09.367 --> 01:12.100
-Go ahead and get behind him.
He's been playin' tricky on me.

01:12.133 --> 01:14.567
-(radio beeps)
-Yeah, I see him.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.867
Uh, this car was leavin'
a house that we had
some interest on

01:16.900 --> 01:20.900
just a little while ago.
Um, it's made a couple
of evasive actions,

01:20.933 --> 01:23.400
not signaling
during the lane changes.

01:23.433 --> 01:26.200
He was in the turn lane,
he immediately jumped over
into the straight lane

01:26.233 --> 01:28.333
within 100 feet
of the intersection here.

01:28.367 --> 01:31.533
We're gonna go ahead
and initiate a traffic stop
on the vehicle.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.533
-He doesn't
want to do that, do he?

01:33.567 --> 01:36.733
-And it looks like
he's probably not gonna stop.

01:36.767 --> 01:40.433
Yeah,
we're gonna be in pursuit.
-(siren blaring)

01:40.467 --> 01:41.900
-(police radio chatter)

01:44.767 --> 01:47.067
-Dubois: 72-55.

01:47.067 --> 01:48.867
-Man on radio:
Southbound on Indiana.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.300
Going 70. Black truck.

01:57.833 --> 02:00.200
-Dubois:
72-55, I'm with that unit.

02:00.233 --> 02:03.600
I'll be second pursuit.
I'll call.

02:03.633 --> 02:06.167
-Woman on radio:
Okay, Indiana and what?

02:06.200 --> 02:09.900
-33-09. 91st. He's crashed out.

02:09.933 --> 02:13.167
-(sirens blaring)

02:15.100 --> 02:17.267
-Get out of the the car now!

02:17.300 --> 02:18.600
Get out! Get on the ground!

02:18.633 --> 02:19.633
-I'm trying!

02:19.667 --> 02:20.767
-Get on the ground.

02:22.967 --> 02:25.767
He threw dope out
at that one sign.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.533
-Ohh... oh, God.

02:28.567 --> 02:31.267
Oh...

02:34.767 --> 02:36.600
-Ohh!

02:38.333 --> 02:44.233
-(police radio chatter)

02:46.367 --> 02:49.067
-Start EMS.
Code B injury.

02:50.667 --> 02:54.233
-Man on radio:
You can cancel 10-33.
He's in custody.

02:54.267 --> 02:56.433
-Oh! Ohh!

02:56.467 --> 02:57.567
-Okay, what's hurting?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.667
-Ooh...
-Tell me what's hurting.

02:59.700 --> 03:00.833
-My arm!
And my leg...

03:00.867 --> 03:01.867
-You wanna sit up?

03:01.900 --> 03:05.167
-You wanna sit up?
-Hold on, please.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.867
-Oh, God...
-Tell me what's hurting.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.767
-Ohh...
-Why'd you run?

03:10.800 --> 03:13.300
-Ohh...

03:13.333 --> 03:15.367
I really didn't think
you was a cop at first.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.900
-What's your--
what's your name?

03:16.933 --> 03:18.367
-Michael.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.567
-Michael.
-I been-- I been gettin' (bleep)
by some Mexican dudes.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.467
-Okay. And that's why
you ran?

03:24.500 --> 03:27.900
-At first I thought it was
just a black truck,
and then I'd already took off.

03:27.933 --> 03:30.300
I kinda panicked.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.067
-Okay.

03:32.067 --> 03:34.200
So you just panicked
because you didn't think
it was a cop?

03:34.233 --> 03:37.100
Why didn't you stop?
Why didn't you stop
when you saw the lights

03:37.133 --> 03:38.600
and the sirens?
Why didn't you stop?

03:38.633 --> 03:41.667
-I'm sayin' at first
I thought that it wasn't a cop.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.567
Oh, God...
-Is there anything in the car
that we need to worry about?

03:44.600 --> 03:48.067
Is there any guns?
Is there any narcotics,
anything like that?

03:48.100 --> 03:51.933
Okay. Not anymore?
-I don't have none.

03:51.967 --> 03:53.533
-Okay.
-I have somethin' in my eye.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.600
-Yeah, it's blood.

03:55.633 --> 03:58.500
So how come you didn't stop
once you saw it was the police?

03:58.533 --> 04:03.633
-'Cause I had already took off.
I already knew y'all were gonna
arrest me.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.533
-Well, not if you just stopped.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.733
What made you think
we were gonna arrest you?

04:07.767 --> 04:10.933
If you stopped,
why would we have the...
-Because I'm already a villain.

04:10.967 --> 04:13.767
You'll always arrest me, man.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.067
-You realize
that you have to have
committed a crime

04:16.100 --> 04:17.800
in order to be arrested,
you understand that, right?

04:17.833 --> 04:20.067
-Man, I know I'm goin' to jail.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.767
-Well, you are now
because you ran from us.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.367
Had you just stopped,
you know, the worst
you probably would've got

04:25.400 --> 04:26.967
was a ticket.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.767
All right.
-Is someone
gonna call my lawyer?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.100
-Woman on radio:
12-45.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.800
-(grunts)
-Anything else hurtin'?

04:32.833 --> 04:36.333
-(groans)
-Well, Michael, is this gonna
teach you

04:36.367 --> 04:38.600
from runnin' next time?

04:38.633 --> 04:41.467
-I said I'm sorry.
-Okay. Okay, sit down.
Sit down.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.167
We got you. We're not gonna
let you fall.
-I'm sorry.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.933
-Sit in the chair, there you go.
-Ohh...

04:48.367 --> 04:50.400
-If he doesn't have warrants,
there's a reason he ran.

04:50.433 --> 04:52.767
We think that he tossed
something out the window.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.367
Um, I don't believe
we've found anything
as of yet, but...

04:57.767 --> 05:00.400
-Woman on radio:
51-36.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.500
-(police radio chatter)

05:03.767 --> 05:05.300
-Okay, west side of the street?

05:05.333 --> 05:06.933
-Man on radio:
Yeah, you can't miss us.

05:06.967 --> 05:09.267
All right, I got ya.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.733
Um, we're headin' over here.
There's the light-- the-- the--

05:12.767 --> 05:14.467
They got the lights
on the vehicles over here.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.267
He tossed somethin' at the start
of the initial pursuit.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.667
Um... so we kinda reviewed video
and were able to determine

05:21.700 --> 05:24.700
it was kind
of in one of the alleys,
and so...they found it.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.100
I'm guessin'
it's gonna be narcotics.
I don't know for sure.

05:34.433 --> 05:36.333
-You just stepped on it.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.400
-Oh, this what he tossed?

05:38.433 --> 05:40.700
Okay.
-We're assumin' it.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.900
-So you saw it?
I didn't even see you,

05:42.933 --> 05:45.067
so when we were goin' through
the light, I was figurin'

05:45.067 --> 05:46.567
you were gonna come in
behind me or whatever.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.700
-(police radio chatter)

05:52.200 --> 05:55.933
-Uh, we got some baggies
used for the selling
of narcotics,

05:55.967 --> 06:00.800
we got a small amount
of what looks
to be methamphetamines...

06:00.833 --> 06:05.233
uh, in ice version.
We'll test it, make sure
it does confirm meth,

06:05.267 --> 06:08.700
but just from appearance
or whatever, it appears
to be methamphetamine.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.733
-Did your dog find it?
-Uh-huh.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.067
-Oh, your dog found it? Okay.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.633
-Yeah, we were comin'--
-Bad?

06:13.667 --> 06:17.167
-Bad. We started where
the construction guys were.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.533
-Yeah?
-And then we just started
workin' the area up this way,

06:19.567 --> 06:22.967
then we started workin' up here
and he put his nose
and sat on that.

06:23.067 --> 06:28.200
-Okay. Uh, what we're doin' now
is, we're gonna go ahead
and, uh, field test

06:28.233 --> 06:30.133
the... the substance.

06:30.167 --> 06:34.667
What we normally do
is we'll field test it on scene.

06:34.700 --> 06:37.267
We will, uh...

06:37.300 --> 06:39.867
at that point,
if it tests positive,

06:39.900 --> 06:42.533
we'll turn it in
to DPS lab
for further analysis,

06:42.567 --> 06:47.567
um, to just verify
from an actual lab.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.433
It'll turn orange
upon appearance

06:51.467 --> 06:54.067
if it's positive
for methamphetamines.

06:54.067 --> 06:56.633
And there's the positive hit.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.900
Don't believe
he has any felony warrants.

06:58.933 --> 07:01.900
Just had a little bit of dope
that he needed to get rid of.

07:04.933 --> 07:08.367
-My whole family's from
a small town outside
of Abilene, Hamlin, Texas.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.367
Real small town. My parents
grew up down the street
from each other.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.367
My dad actually went home
on the first day
of kindergarten

07:15.400 --> 07:19.467
and said that he was gonna marry
a girl that is now my mom.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.367
So I had a really strong
foundation growin' up

07:22.400 --> 07:26.067
of what a relationship
was supposed to look like,

07:26.067 --> 07:28.833
uh, how a marriage
was supposed to work.

07:28.867 --> 07:32.300
We're on our way
to a domestic, uh...

07:32.333 --> 07:36.067
RP called in and said
that his ex-girlfriend

07:36.067 --> 07:39.967
was fightin' with... um, him
and another friend.

07:40.067 --> 07:42.433
Eight-two, 10-23.

07:44.867 --> 07:47.067
-Male 1: You need to go.
Please leave.
-Male 2: Go!

07:47.067 --> 07:49.600
-What's goin' on?
-He just threw me on the floor.

07:49.633 --> 07:52.067
-She just hit me.
-No, she's been hitting
both of us.

07:52.067 --> 07:53.467
-That's all we want her is gone.
-Come here.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.067
-That's it. That's all we want.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.567
-She was supposed
to leave earlier.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.433
-Y'all go stand by the car.
-Yes, sir.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.433
-Okay.
What's goin' on?

08:00.467 --> 08:02.300
-What's goin' on?

08:02.333 --> 08:05.633
This is my boyfriend...
Well, was.

08:05.667 --> 08:08.800
Because he has
a new bitch in my house, right?

08:08.833 --> 08:12.200
I've been calling him
to let me see my kids.

08:12.233 --> 08:15.567
When I got here,
I seen this girl
in my boyfriend's car.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.300
And I walked up to her
and I said, "Hey,
what's your name?

08:18.333 --> 08:22.400
What are you doing here?"
I said, "Who are you here with?
Are you here with Jaime?"

08:22.433 --> 08:26.133
She said, "Yeah."
I said, "You know, Jaime,
Jaime and I are together."

08:26.167 --> 08:29.200
I said, "He gots a girlfriend.
We're tryin' to work
things out."

08:29.233 --> 08:31.467
-So what-- what exactly
happened tonight, then?

08:31.500 --> 08:33.800
-Tonight, all I wanted
was the truth.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.633
That's all I wanted
to talk to him about
was the truth.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.567
-So how did you end up
with grass all over you?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.600
-'Cause he threw me
on the floor.
-Who threw you on the floor?

08:39.633 --> 08:41.067
-My boyfriend did.
-Okay.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.700
Hey, so what's goin' on?

08:45.100 --> 08:48.833
-Earlier today,
she came knocking on my door,

08:48.867 --> 08:51.733
asking to see the kids,
but we been separated.

08:51.767 --> 08:56.933
And, uh, all of a sudden,
you know, she's, you know,
wanting to see the kids.

08:56.967 --> 08:59.900
so I was like, "Yeah, cool."
You know what I mean?
See the kids. Whatever.

09:00.067 --> 09:03.567
Well, all of a sudden,
she starts trying to argue
with me, whatever,

09:03.600 --> 09:05.167
she starts trying
to get physical.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.967
Well, she breaks my--
my big window in the front.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.700
She throws a wrench through it--
-When was this?

09:09.733 --> 09:12.433
-Earlier this morning.
-I'd say between 9:00 and 11:00.

09:12.467 --> 09:16.533
-So, uh... all she was supposed
to do was just get her stuff
and leave.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.800
You know what I mean?
That's what the officers wanted,
you know,

09:18.833 --> 09:21.733
that's all I wanted. So--
-So we've already
been out here once today.

09:21.767 --> 09:24.400
-Yeah, this morning!
So, they told me that
if like she comes back,

09:24.433 --> 09:27.367
just call us again.
We're separated.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.200
So, you know, I--
I was in the car
with another friend,

09:31.233 --> 09:33.800
you know what I mean,
and then, I just see her,

09:33.833 --> 09:35.933
all of a sudden popped up
in my passenger door

09:35.967 --> 09:39.333
with the other chick.
She, you know, starts
tryin' to rush her,

09:39.367 --> 09:42.633
so I bring her this way,
she slips out of my hand,
and she starts swinging on me.

09:42.667 --> 09:46.300
She hits me, and then
my brother-in-law comes up,
trying to separate us,

09:46.333 --> 09:49.167
she hits him.
You know what I mean?
All I was trying to do

09:49.200 --> 09:50.767
was get her to leave.
-Where'd she hit you at?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.467
-She hit me in my eye.
-In your eye?

09:52.500 --> 09:53.933
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:53.967 --> 09:56.333
So it caused that swelling,
is it always swelled up
like that?

09:56.367 --> 09:59.100
-No, she just hit me.
-All right. I see you got
the swelling.

09:59.133 --> 10:01.167
-Sh-- she hit me,
and then my brother-in-law
came to try to--

10:01.200 --> 10:04.267
-She was trying to
get away from him,
and she threw herself...

10:04.300 --> 10:06.633
-Come here!
-What did you see happen?

10:06.667 --> 10:09.300
-Okay, like I, like I told 'em,
I was like, "Tell her to leave,"

10:09.333 --> 10:11.333
like so he was pushing her away,
telling her to leave.

10:11.367 --> 10:14.033
And I was like, "I'm just
gonna sit here and watch y'all."
A witness or whatever.

10:14.067 --> 10:16.800
And she was pushing
her away. She was fightin'
with them

10:16.833 --> 10:19.467
and tryin' to like
get around 'em,
like, "No, (bleep) bitch,"

10:19.500 --> 10:21.600
Talkin' (bleep) of course,
of course.

10:21.633 --> 10:24.033
And so like,
in the midst of that,
she just like, threw herself,

10:24.067 --> 10:26.433
so that's when she fell,
like she-- when-- you know,
like she told you

10:26.467 --> 10:28.800
how she fell or whatever.
That's when she fell,
I watched her.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.100
-Okay.
-She did hit me in the face.

10:30.133 --> 10:32.967
-Where'd she hit you at?
-Like my nose.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.333
-Up in your nose?
-Yeah, my nose,
and like right here.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.400
There. Like, my nose is hurting.

10:37.433 --> 10:38.667
-Okay.
-Yeah.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.800
-She says that you shoved her
to the ground.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.033
-No, it's just, you know,
like I said, I was just tryin'
to keep her

10:43.067 --> 10:47.033
from breaking that other chick,
and, you know, I--
out of this with it,

10:47.067 --> 10:49.200
I just had her like this,
you know...
-Okay.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.967
-But I mean, that was it.
You know what I mean?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.500
-Then she slipped
out of your arms?
-Yeah.

10:52.533 --> 10:55.633
All I did, man,
is just, I wanted her gone,
you know what I mean,

10:55.667 --> 10:58.133
'cause...
-Okay. And she got
all of her stuff and left?

10:58.167 --> 10:59.833
-No, she just grabbed a bag
and left.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.833
-So she still has property
in the house?

11:01.867 --> 11:03.300
-Yeah, she still
has property in the house.

11:03.333 --> 11:04.500
-Okay. Just hang tight
over here.

11:04.533 --> 11:07.100
-I lashed out on him
a while back.

11:07.133 --> 11:11.533
I'm on probation...
yeah, of course.
Been on it for 10 years.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.633
Still got five more years to go.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.967
-When you were over here
earlier today...
-Yeah, I was over--

11:16.067 --> 11:18.900
-and you threw the wrench
through the window...
-Yeah.

11:18.933 --> 11:20.633
-did they tell you
you weren't supposed
to come back

11:20.667 --> 11:23.800
over here anymore?
-No, they-- he just said
that I just needed to leave,

11:23.833 --> 11:25.600
that's all he said.
-Okay.

11:25.633 --> 11:28.200
-I have a one-year-old
and a two-year-old

11:28.233 --> 11:33.067
that I'm tryin' to do my best
to be in their lives,

11:33.100 --> 11:37.467
but with them in my house,
I cannot do it.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.100
You know what I mean?
That's all I want.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.900
-What's your name, ma'am?
-Rosita.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.467
-Just put your hands
behind your back, okay?

11:46.067 --> 11:48.633
-Why do I gotta go to jail?
-'Cause you assaulted
your boyfriend.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.867
-And he's-- Jaime!
-No. Do not start yelling.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.467
-We're not doin' that.
-For real, Jaime?

11:54.500 --> 11:58.067
They were holding me,
and I-- and I-- and I
tried to go like this, so--

11:58.067 --> 11:59.800
-Well, it sounds like
your boyfriend was holding you

11:59.833 --> 12:01.300
to keep you from assaulting
anybody else,

12:01.333 --> 12:03.133
'cause you had already
tried to assault this other girl

12:03.167 --> 12:04.600
and already hit your boyfriend.

12:04.633 --> 12:06.467
-Mm-hmm.
-So, it sounds like

12:06.500 --> 12:08.833
they were just trying to keep
you from assaulting people.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.233
-All right. Let's go.
-But I, I try-- I tried,
to like, you know,

12:11.267 --> 12:13.333
tried to communicate with him.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.500
Babe! Please!
-Can she see her son?

12:15.533 --> 12:18.467
-Can I-- Huh?
-Can she see her son!

12:18.500 --> 12:21.167
-No.
-I just wanted to talk
to you.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.800
-Sit down.
-(sighs)

12:26.933 --> 12:30.800
-Can I talk to him, please?
-No. He doesn't want to
come over here.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.833
-I just want to talk to him,
please.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.433
-He said he doesn't want to
come over here.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.267
-Babe, please!

12:36.300 --> 12:39.200
Babe, can I talk to you,
please, love?

12:39.233 --> 12:42.600
Babe, can I please
talk to you, love?

12:42.633 --> 12:44.533
-Here's the deal.
You're goin' to jail tonight
for assault

12:44.567 --> 12:46.267
because you punched
your boyfriend in the face,

12:46.300 --> 12:47.900
and you punched the other guy
in the nose.

12:47.933 --> 12:52.300
-Please, come talk to me!
Please, babe, please!

12:52.333 --> 12:54.167
Babe!

12:59.433 --> 13:00.967
-Cut that out.
-Please!

13:01.067 --> 13:03.533
Babe! Please, love!
-Hey.

13:03.567 --> 13:05.867
If you hit your head
like that one more time,

13:05.900 --> 13:08.200
I'm gonna bring the paddywagon
over here, and I'm gonna
surfboard you,

13:08.233 --> 13:09.667
and you're gonna be
completely immobilized

13:09.700 --> 13:10.767
all the way
to the county jail.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.067
-Do you understand that?
-I just want to talk!

13:13.100 --> 13:14.433
-Okay, he doesn't
want to talk to you.

13:14.467 --> 13:17.267
-Babe, come here! Please!

13:17.300 --> 13:19.400
-Go ahead and roll.

13:19.433 --> 13:21.900
Uh, it's pretty clear
that they're trying
to restrain her

13:21.933 --> 13:23.733
and get her
to leave the property.

13:23.767 --> 13:27.100
She's the primary aggressor,
so she's gonna end up
goin' to jail tonight

13:27.133 --> 13:29.400
for domestic assault.

13:32.133 --> 13:36.233
-We here out at District 3,
we-- we've experienced loss
personally to us

13:36.267 --> 13:38.833
with the death
of Deputy Jesse Valdez.

13:38.867 --> 13:40.933
Unfortunately, he was on his way
to a call

13:40.967 --> 13:43.633
and a woman that was high
on methamphetamine

13:43.667 --> 13:46.133
crossed over into his lane,
striking him head on,

13:46.167 --> 13:48.167
and he ended up losing his life
for it.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.500
So... as a tribute to Jesse,
I-- I try to get out there

13:51.533 --> 13:55.100
and get as much drugs
off the street as possible.

13:55.133 --> 13:58.667
This car, it failed to signal
when it made the left turn

13:58.700 --> 14:02.767
on this street up here, and...
and it looks like
it's backin' up

14:02.800 --> 14:04.400
and tryin' to make a weird
three-point turn,

14:04.433 --> 14:06.467
and we're gonna stop it here.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.433
-(siren blares)

14:11.800 --> 14:14.333
-All right... let's get 'em.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.067
Hey, deputy with
Harris County Sheriffs Office.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.133
-What's goin' on, bud?
-Nothin', I was meetin' my aunt.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.867
She's about to turn around
right here.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.100
-Yeah? All right,
you didn't t--
use your turn signal

14:33.133 --> 14:34.900
whenever you turned
on the street back there,

14:34.933 --> 14:36.200
and you got a brake light out.

14:36.233 --> 14:37.367
-Did you know that?
-I do?

14:37.400 --> 14:39.667
-Mm-hmm.
Is there anything
illegal in this car?

14:39.700 --> 14:41.133
-No, sir.
-Is there any weed in this car?

14:41.167 --> 14:43.500
-No, sir.
I was just smokin' it
right there at my house.

14:43.533 --> 14:46.133
-All right. 'Cause I'm
smellin' it, I'm gonna have you
step out, all right?

14:46.167 --> 14:48.100
-All right, sir.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.867
-Hey, step out.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.933
Come back here.

14:53.967 --> 14:56.267
Got anything on you
that's gonna poke, stick
or hurt?

14:56.300 --> 14:58.367
Put your hands on the car.
Put your hands on the car.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.467
-I was just smokin'
before you--

15:05.500 --> 15:07.067
-All right, put your hands
down here, bud.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.933
You're not under arrest,
you're bein' detained,
you understand?

15:08.967 --> 15:11.100
-I know.

15:11.133 --> 15:13.500
-14-21. I have one detained,
I'm under control.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.767
-Come back here, bud.
-Yes, sir.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.533
-Whatcha doin' out here?
-Sir?

15:16.567 --> 15:19.067
-Whatcha doin' out here?
-My sister staying right here
on Waco Street, sir.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.833
-Yeah? Stand against the car.
Am I gonna find anything
in that car?

15:21.867 --> 15:24.600
-No, you can search it.
Tear that bitch up.
-Okay.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.267
Your sister stays on Waco?
-Yes, right here.

15:27.300 --> 15:31.067
-Okay. All right,
do me a favor, put your butt
on that push bumper?

15:31.067 --> 15:33.067
All right, I'm gonna make sure
you ain't got nothin' illegal.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.233
Do you have a driver's license?
-Yes, it's in there. I got I.D.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.933
-Okay. You got insurance
on that car?

15:36.967 --> 15:38.333
-Yeah.
-Okay.

15:38.367 --> 15:40.867
My question was, do you have
a driver's license, not an I.D.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.567
-Yeah, I got a driver's license.
-Is it good?

15:42.600 --> 15:46.733
-Uh... I'm just paying
surcharges on it.
-Okay. Hang tight, bud.

15:48.633 --> 15:52.300
Made the traffic stop
and I immediately smelled
burnt marijuana,

15:52.333 --> 15:55.100
so... I got consent
to search anyways.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.233
Did he just throw somethin'?

16:03.067 --> 16:05.233
What'd you throw, dude?

16:05.267 --> 16:07.500
-Sir?
-What'd you throw?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.467
-What I throw?
-What did you throw?

16:09.500 --> 16:12.100
-I pulled up my pants.
That's what I did,
right here, look.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.167
-All right, look here, 'kay?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.333
Did you throw somethin'
over there?

16:17.367 --> 16:19.700
-This what I--
-You g-- Hey... you gonna
waste my time,

16:19.733 --> 16:21.067
make me get a narcotics dog
out here?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.667
-I'm not--
-'Cause if I find somethin
over there,

16:22.700 --> 16:24.233
I'm gonna charge you
with it, man.

16:24.267 --> 16:26.167
-I'm not wasting your time, sir.
-Okay. Is there anything
over there?

16:26.200 --> 16:27.733
-I'm tellin' you what I did,
I did like this.

16:27.767 --> 16:30.400
I pulled up my pants...
(indistinct)

16:30.433 --> 16:33.500
I did like this.
When I got out of the car,
I did just like this.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.400
-You stupid, dude.

16:53.733 --> 16:57.600
Seriously? You just turned
a misdemeanor...
-You just--

16:57.633 --> 16:59.733
-Listen.
-You just-- you just
searched me...

16:59.767 --> 17:01.433
-Listen to me...
-You just searched me, sir.

17:01.467 --> 17:03.600
-No, I patted you down
for weapons is what I did,
I didn't search you.

17:03.633 --> 17:05.867
-I didn't have (bleep) on me.
-Listen. You just turned
a misdemeanor,

17:05.900 --> 17:08.067
possession of marijuana,
into a felony, tampering
with evidence.

17:08.067 --> 17:10.967
-Man, you gotta be--
can't be serious.

17:11.067 --> 17:15.200
He said I threw some-- I pulled
up my goddamn pants like this.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.600
-What's that?
-Look like weed.

17:16.633 --> 17:19.933
-Yeah.
-Dude, how am I gonna throw
anything off me though?

17:19.967 --> 17:23.633
Bro, I'm-- I'm tellin' you
the honest to God truth.
-No, you're not.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.667
Check right there. You see
that red light right there?

17:25.700 --> 17:27.800
That's called a dash camera.
-All right.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.567
-They-- they don't lie.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.167
You just turned a misdemeanor
that I probably would've
had you-- just wrote you

17:33.200 --> 17:35.433
a ticket for...
-Man, I don't--

17:35.467 --> 17:38.067
-into a felony.
-Sir, I'm just trying
to get to my house.

17:38.067 --> 17:41.300
-All right.
-Over some weed?

17:41.333 --> 17:44.233
-Yep.
-Damn, man.

17:45.633 --> 17:48.700
(bleep)... Man, my mama
is gonna be pissed.

17:48.733 --> 17:51.833
-All right, now that--
Hey, listen to me.
Now that that's over with...

17:51.867 --> 17:54.067
Hey, look at me.
-Can't you let me
just call my mama

17:54.100 --> 17:55.967
and tell it to her?
That's all, man.
-Listen to me, okay?

17:56.067 --> 17:58.700
I haven't made no decision yet.
Okay? Listen to me,
I haven't made a decision yet,

17:58.733 --> 18:00.767
okay?
Now I need to know from you,

18:00.800 --> 18:03.200
is there anything else
in that car?
-Ain't nothin' in that truck,

18:03.233 --> 18:06.200
I promise. Honest to truth...
-Okay. Are we done?
Are we done playing games?

18:06.233 --> 18:09.200
-I'm through. I ain't--
Don't need to lie to you. Man,
I'm sorry for even lyin' to you.

18:09.233 --> 18:11.467
-Okay.
-Officer, didn't--
I ain't...

18:11.500 --> 18:12.967
-Okay.
-(bleep)

18:13.067 --> 18:14.800
-So... I mean,
this ain't my first day
on the job, okay?

18:14.833 --> 18:16.367
-I understand.
-Okay.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.500
-I don't sell drugs, though.
-I didn't say you sold.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.333
-I don't do none of that.
-I didn't say you sold drugs.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.067
-You can search that,
you can tear that bitch up.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.333
-You just smoked a little weed?
-Yeah, I was just smokin' it
right here

18:24.367 --> 18:26.800
and that truck there--
-Hey, turn around,
I'm gonna tighten--

18:26.833 --> 18:29.333
I'm gonna double lock
those cuffs so they don't
tighten up on you, all right?

18:29.367 --> 18:31.333
-That truck there that
was passin' in front of me?
-Mm-hmm.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.433
-She was just about to
bag up and come meet me.
-Mm-hmm.

18:33.467 --> 18:36.367
-That's my little--
my little bitch. I ain't
gonna even lie to you.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.633
-Were you gonna give her
a little bit of it?
-I was about to-- No,

18:38.667 --> 18:40.533
I was about to smoke it myself.
She don't smoke.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.567
-Okay.
-I about to knock
the hoe down right here.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.500
I ain't gonna lie to you, man.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.633
-All right.

18:50.667 --> 18:54.833
-You ain't gonna find
nothin' in the truck, though,
my damn wife's truck.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.400
She gonna be so mother--
-All right, hang tight for me,
I'll talk to you in a second.

18:58.433 --> 19:00.400
-All right.

19:00.433 --> 19:03.267
-Uh, I'm pretty sure
once I play this dash cam back

19:03.300 --> 19:08.767
I'm gonna be able to, uh,
see him, tossing a little
plastic bag of marijuana.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.633
This is the video.
At one point, he actually
turns around

19:11.667 --> 19:16.867
and looks at the dash cam
right before he throws
the bag of marijuana.

19:16.900 --> 19:21.367
You know, the amount
of marijuana he had
was a misdemeanor,

19:21.400 --> 19:24.433
and by him throwing it
and trying to conceal it,
that's a felony.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.567
It's a tampering with evidence
charge. He threw it just then.

19:29.400 --> 19:33.300
All right, you're under arrest
for felony tampering
with evidence, okay?

19:33.333 --> 19:34.733
-All right.
-Dude, what were you thinking?

19:34.767 --> 19:37.567
At one point, you looked back
and saw the dash cam.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.933
You saw the red light.
-I-- just wanted
to go home, man.

19:40.967 --> 19:44.133
-Did you know that red light
was the camera?
-Yeah.

19:44.167 --> 19:46.733
-Is that why you scooted over
a little bit?
-Yeah.

19:46.767 --> 19:47.767
-All right, bud, we gotta go.

19:47.800 --> 19:48.800
-(car door slams shut)

19:50.433 --> 19:52.767
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.233
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.267 --> 19:55.367
Cover is code three.

19:55.400 --> 19:59.433
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.300 --> 20:06.267
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.800
-(theme music playing)
