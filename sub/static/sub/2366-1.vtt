- <i>So, why do it?
- 'Cause it's dangerous.</i>

00:35.513 --> 00:38.401
<i>Like you can sprain
a tit or something.</i>

00:38.405 --> 00:41.975
<i>This is the most dangerous sport
in American high school, bitch.</i>

00:41.976 --> 00:44.177
<i>More dangerous than football?</i>

00:44.178 --> 00:47.845
<i>More catastrophic
injuries per student.</i>

00:49.649 --> 00:52.350
<i>- How do I look?</i>
- <i>Dangerous.</i>

00:52.819 --> 00:54.486
<i>Duh.</i>

01:00.427 --> 01:02.662
<i>Take me through a typical Thursday.</i>

01:02.663 --> 01:05.298
<i>Well, first I get up at
the ass crack for my run.</i>

01:05.299 --> 01:08.134
<i>I mean, obviously staying in
shape is a part of the gig.</i>

01:08.135 --> 01:11.104
<i>It's called cheerleading. You
know, I have to be a leader.</i>

01:11.105 --> 01:12.172
Oh, Marvin.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.506
<i>And diplomatic.</i>

01:13.507 --> 01:14.574
Proactive.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.309
Seriously, hon.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.011
<i>Come to the realm, boys!</i>

01:18.012 --> 01:20.647
<i>My bitches do not disappoint.</i>

01:20.648 --> 01:23.548
<i>So why do you call
yourselves bitches?</i>

01:24.317 --> 01:26.553
<i>Blackfoot Bloodhounds, yo.</i>

01:26.554 --> 01:30.322
<i>Boys be dogs, girls
be bitches. Gangster.</i>

01:32.292 --> 01:33.593
<i>Not now, Leena.</i>

01:34.695 --> 01:36.528
<i>Maddy!</i>

01:43.837 --> 01:46.740
<i>After that, I track
down Terry and, um...</i>

01:46.741 --> 01:48.508
<i>Blue up his balls.</i>

01:48.509 --> 01:53.279
God, Terry charges
my bones. For real.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.682
<i>Next year, he's captain of
the football team and...</i>

01:55.683 --> 02:01.187
<i>I'm captain of the squad, so it's pretty
much gonna be the best year ever.</i>

02:01.188 --> 02:03.289
<i>MMS class.</i>

02:03.290 --> 02:05.925
<i>I avoid taking honors classes,
so I can maintain all A's.</i>

02:05.926 --> 02:07.994
<i>Overheard that from a senior
bitch, freshmen year.</i>

02:07.995 --> 02:10.229
<i>Take basic classes, show up on time</i>

02:10.231 --> 02:13.665
and always look hot!

02:13.900 --> 02:15.902
And he's married!

02:15.903 --> 02:19.105
<i>Hey, Trace. K-Mads is making me
the star of her little class video.</i>

02:19.106 --> 02:21.474
<i>Please, call me Maddy. Not K-Mads.</i>

02:21.475 --> 02:24.411
<i>Hey! Each day this week, I'm
filming a different student.</i>

02:24.412 --> 02:26.780
<i>Getting school from their
perspective. So...</i>

02:26.781 --> 02:29.716
Well, oh! Hi!

02:29.717 --> 02:32.452
<i>Easy to judge everyone else
from behind this thing, huh?</i>

02:32.453 --> 02:33.720
<i>Yeah, can I?</i>

02:33.721 --> 02:35.321
<i>Thank you!</i>

02:35.322 --> 02:37.924
<i>Do you wanna show
me some action now?</i>

02:37.925 --> 02:40.860
<i>Bitch, I thought you
would never ask.</i>

02:40.861 --> 02:42.529
- <i>Where's Hanna?</i>
<i>- Here!</i>

02:42.530 --> 02:45.730
- Sorry, Lexi, the head got stuck and...
- Put it on.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.089
- Well?
- Magical.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.326
All right, smart ass.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.197
Check this shit out.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.837
Oh, my God!

03:23.838 --> 03:25.472
Get up, Alexis!

03:25.473 --> 03:27.405
Alexis!

04:13.286 --> 04:17.188
Bomb Vik. Get that arm warm, cuz.

04:26.699 --> 04:30.101
Oh, poor Hanna. Still a
prisoner to child lock.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.443
Thank you, Manny.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.685
Hanna!

04:49.923 --> 04:51.224
Seriously?

04:51.225 --> 04:53.659
Not in front of my little sister.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.761
Okay.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.129
Yeah.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.464
Okay.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.669
- Cheetos.
- Goddamn, dude.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.604
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.573
I would've eaten those.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.740
Nah, it taste like shit.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.043
Listen up, <i>chiquitas.</i>

05:10.044 --> 05:12.011
I got one spot open.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.314
But, I don't have
to take any of you.

05:14.315 --> 05:17.917
I'd rather be one bitch
short, than have a weakling.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.753
When I say your name,
line up in front of me.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.855
And girls...

05:23.923 --> 05:26.191
Don't waste my time.

05:28.094 --> 05:29.928
Corra.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.564
Jen.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.532
Bonnie.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.734
Megan.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.371
Vanessa.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.038
What the f?

05:41.674 --> 05:43.508
Maddy?

05:45.245 --> 05:47.180
Dang, man. Who is that?

05:47.181 --> 05:48.715
Maddy.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.196
Goddamn, somebody gave
that bitch a credit card.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.553
What do you think you're doing?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.755
Uh, there's a spot
open and I want it.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.524
This isn't easy for
us, okay, Maddy?

05:58.525 --> 06:01.794
We put it off as long as possible,
out of respect to Lexi.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.496
God rest her soul.

06:03.497 --> 06:07.000
Yeah, well, Alexis
was my friend, too.

06:07.001 --> 06:10.136
Did you guys know that we did
gymnastics together, 7th grade?

06:10.137 --> 06:13.504
I guess, she went one way
and I went another and...

06:14.274 --> 06:18.745
I don't know, I guess
with everything...

06:18.746 --> 06:22.881
Look, I uh, I just know that she was
happier than me and I wanna find out why.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.586
I'm not asking for any favors.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.419
You won't get any.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.104
Keep it up. Let's go, let's go.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.906
Hey, why don't you kiss George.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.874
Come on, take what you
want like a goddamn pro.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.616
Come on!

07:35.121 --> 07:36.888
Ow!

07:45.832 --> 07:47.667
Welcome to the squad, bitch.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.579
<i>Check this shit out.</i>

08:09.189 --> 08:10.156
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

08:10.157 --> 08:11.457
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

08:11.458 --> 08:13.791
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
- <i>Alexis!</i>

08:19.166 --> 08:22.633
<i>So, uh, here is the new wardrobe.</i>

08:22.802 --> 08:24.771
<i>Ta da!</i>

08:24.772 --> 08:28.040
<i>You cannot believe the kind of money
these chicks drop on clothes.</i>

08:28.041 --> 08:30.810
<i>Physical stuff, I can handle.</i>

08:30.811 --> 08:35.346
<i>The hard part is going to be, pretending
that I actually like those dumb bitches.</i>

08:37.116 --> 08:39.784
<i>Like that dipshit, Tracy.</i>

08:40.620 --> 08:41.953
<i>Acts like she's all sad</i>

08:41.955 --> 08:43.623
<i>but then, jumps on Terry's jock</i>

08:43.624 --> 08:46.292
<i>before Alexis is
even in the ground.</i>

08:46.293 --> 08:48.459
<i>That's classy.</i>

08:50.062 --> 08:52.063
<i>And Terry...</i>

08:53.099 --> 08:56.200
<i>Mr. big bad wolf himself.</i>

08:59.405 --> 09:03.341
<i>I'm gonna ruin your perfect
little senior year, dog.</i>

09:20.226 --> 09:21.994
Jesus Christ!

09:21.995 --> 09:23.463
Leena, what do you want?

09:23.464 --> 09:26.097
Wow, you look, uh...

09:26.332 --> 09:28.167
Uh...

09:28.168 --> 09:31.003
You... you have a lot of makeup on.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.271
- So?
- Can we talk?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.339
No.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.441
Uh, please?

09:35.442 --> 09:38.110
Look, I'm sorry things
got so intense.

09:38.111 --> 09:41.581
And I'm trying to respect that you
want to be alone and everything,

09:41.582 --> 09:43.850
- but, we really need to talk.
- About what?

09:43.851 --> 09:46.018
About you and... and...

09:46.019 --> 09:48.653
Well, Little Madeline here.

09:49.989 --> 09:53.424
Oh, hell no, you did not
name the kitten after me.

09:55.962 --> 09:59.866
- Oh, fuck, Leena.
- I know it's pathetic and...

09:59.867 --> 10:03.169
I was lonely and it
doesn't matter, okay?

10:03.170 --> 10:05.872
She was in perfect health when I got
her and then, I gave her your name

10:05.873 --> 10:07.974
and she got sick, just
like that out of nowhere.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.376
And I suppose, you want me to think
it's one of your signs, am I right?

10:10.377 --> 10:12.810
Well, yeah. I mean...

10:13.779 --> 10:15.915
Look at yourself.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.117
You're like a different person.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.918
Something is going on, right?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.025
Can you just listen?

10:26.026 --> 10:27.560
She didn't just get sick, okay?

10:27.561 --> 10:29.262
- She died.
- Leena!

10:29.263 --> 10:30.663
It's over.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.497
What's up, bitch?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.636
Sick threads. Make 'em yourself?

10:40.907 --> 10:42.341
Yeah.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.944
Did Mads tell you the
news? It's official.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.946
She's a cheer... leader.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.149
Later.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.283
Blackfoot Bloodhounds, bitches.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.085
Ow!

11:59.086 --> 12:00.886
I'm sorry, sis.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.156
Hey, this really
brings out your face.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.725
- Really?
- You look so beautiful, yeah.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.025
- Really?
- Totally.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.697
You okay?

12:15.034 --> 12:16.969
Do you think Lexi
would be mad at me?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.738
Why?

12:18.739 --> 12:21.539
- 'Cause of me and Terry.
- Oh.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.945
- I'm rotten.
- No, you're not rotten.

12:25.946 --> 12:29.780
- Tracy, you're just... You're living.
- Hmm.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.483
Did you like him before?

12:33.452 --> 12:36.389
Uh, before Alexis died, I mean.

12:36.390 --> 12:38.956
I wasn't going to do
anything about it.

12:40.292 --> 12:44.128
I mean, Lexi and I always liked the same
things that's why we were best friends.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.000
Mmm.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.303
Well, don't look at me like that.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.139
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- No, I'm...

12:53.140 --> 12:54.874
Damn it, seriously, okay?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.341
Dogs are coming over.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.653
You know the rules.

13:07.654 --> 13:10.122
It's bitches only, tonight. Okay?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.290
So, run along.

13:13.659 --> 13:18.062
And Mr. Man. Yeah, don't even
think about calling me tonight.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.034
Martha, my dear?

13:26.639 --> 13:30.908
We would never consider
breaking Blackfoot tradition.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.345
Which is why,

13:33.346 --> 13:37.581
we are on our way to break into the
school for our annual pool party.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.286
Dogs, only.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.688
I just came to drop
something off for my gal.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.819
Oh, man, I wanted to
piss in their pool.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.127
Bye, Martha!

13:50.930 --> 13:53.265
We were just talking about you.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.166
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.338
Here.

14:02.041 --> 14:05.878
I found it. It's broken. But,
it's still kinda cool, right?

14:05.879 --> 14:08.145
Aw! You're so sweet.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.117
It's just a broken clasp,
I can make it work.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.453
Where'd you find it?

14:22.762 --> 14:25.331
Oh, my God!

14:25.332 --> 14:27.166
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

14:27.167 --> 14:28.933
Look!

14:28.968 --> 14:31.168
Look, so sweet!

14:32.905 --> 14:34.972
Yeah, it is.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.408
What's wrong?

14:40.846 --> 14:42.581
I don't know, I...

14:42.582 --> 14:44.216
I feel like I should
tell you something

14:44.217 --> 14:46.952
but, you just seem so happy.

14:46.953 --> 14:50.321
Jesus. Okay, now you
have to tell me.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.528
Okay, will you...

14:55.529 --> 14:57.596
You said that you and
Terry got together

14:57.597 --> 15:00.131
on the last day of school, right?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.200
Yeah, why?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.005
It's just...

15:06.006 --> 15:08.973
I saw him and Cassie
Decker together...

15:09.241 --> 15:11.876
At the lake, fourth
of July weekend.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.479
Cassie Decker?

15:19.885 --> 15:22.388
What's wrong with her? Can't she
just find some college guys.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.490
Tracy, there's only one
person to blame for this.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.192
- I just think that...
- No buts.

15:26.193 --> 15:29.395
He cheated on you. He's an asshole!

15:35.936 --> 15:37.837
- Give it to me, please.
- Well, say it. No!

15:37.838 --> 15:39.703
Say it!

15:40.606 --> 15:42.273
Terry's an asshole!

15:42.408 --> 15:44.074
Yeah.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.352
- He's gonna freak.
- Fuck him.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.689
- Tracy, stop!
- No.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.227
It's okay.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.497
Look at you.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.435
- Maddy?
- Hmm?

16:12.805 --> 16:15.841
Is the rumor about you
and Leena Miller true?

16:15.842 --> 16:17.741
What's the rumor?

16:51.977 --> 16:53.777
- You okay?
- Hmm.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.083
Hmm.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.252
Was that weird?

17:01.253 --> 17:03.454
Was what weird?

17:11.664 --> 17:13.699
Oh, wait. Here.

17:13.700 --> 17:18.971
Take my car, pick me up
tomorrow before practice.

17:18.972 --> 17:21.473
No, it's fine, I'm gonna walk.
We're practically neighbors.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.607
- You sure?
- Yeah.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.280
Thanks, Mads.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.549
No problem.

17:34.119 --> 17:37.256
Get some sleep. You wanna look
hot for the rally, tomorrow.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.490
That's right, bitch.

18:53.432 --> 18:57.736
What do you think my chances
are tonight with Martha?

18:57.737 --> 19:01.507
The chances of you striking
out? Pretty goddamn good.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.675
Come on, man. It's rally night.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.845
- Something could happen.
- She even let you smell it?

19:09.681 --> 19:11.450
Hey, guys.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.319
I snagged a couple of bottles of kank
out of my dad's garage last night.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.256
- Shit, you guys smoke?
- Enough to kill a horse, yo.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.124
Do we keep this party
exclusive enough?

19:19.125 --> 19:22.761
Yo, if we ain't hung the fuck
over for the first day tomorrow.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.163
We just ain't dogs. Woof!

19:31.270 --> 19:32.438
Terry?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.673
Hey, man.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.908
You mind not slamming every
single weight down like that?

19:38.477 --> 19:41.011
It's a weight room. Get over it.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.683
Whatever, dude.

21:06.131 --> 21:09.268
So, you really think
I did good tonight?

21:09.269 --> 21:11.803
Are you kidding?
You are a natural, okay?

21:11.804 --> 21:15.045
It's a rush, huh? Getting the
whole school fired up like that?

21:15.374 --> 21:17.441
It's real fun.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.648
Need another brew, Manny?

21:29.521 --> 21:31.623
- Oh!
- What's that, it sprayed in my mouth.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.925
Hi.

21:32.926 --> 21:34.059
- How are you doing?
- Good.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.827
I got a...

21:35.828 --> 21:37.494
Ooh!

21:44.803 --> 21:46.104
Don't mention it.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.585
Hey, Tracy. Do you
know where Terry is?

21:59.586 --> 22:01.320
He wasn't at the rally and
he's not answering me.

22:01.321 --> 22:05.624
Probably eating dick somewhere.
Wait, what? What's going on?

22:05.625 --> 22:08.727
I'm gonna go get a drink. That's
what's going on. Want one?

22:08.728 --> 22:10.494
Yeah.

22:10.696 --> 22:12.664
So, uh, do you know what's up?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.032
Well, that's between
Terry and Tracy.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.067
You sure?

22:17.703 --> 22:19.271
What do you mean?

22:19.272 --> 22:21.572
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

22:24.376 --> 22:28.679
But, I'm glad you're hanging
out with us, tonight. It's cool.

22:32.884 --> 22:35.018
What are those?

22:35.554 --> 22:40.392
- You'll just make fun of me.
- No, I wouldn't.

22:40.393 --> 22:43.827
These stones put out special energy,
all I'm doing is focusing it.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.398
On what?

22:46.399 --> 22:48.867
- Protecting someone.
- Who?

22:48.868 --> 22:49.540
Oh.

22:49.541 --> 22:52.427
Look, Hanna. I'm kinda
doing my own thing here.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.973
Okay, sorry.

23:01.146 --> 23:03.013
Hanna?

23:04.950 --> 23:07.517
Come on, I'll show you.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.364
Okay.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.634
This is you.

23:25.203 --> 23:27.838
This is somebody close to you.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.478
This is somebody close to them.

23:35.113 --> 23:37.981
Does this sound right to you?

23:40.952 --> 23:43.053
What do I do now?

23:44.089 --> 23:45.856
Uh...

23:47.392 --> 23:50.894
Clear your mind and
focus on what you want.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.033
Anything I want?

23:55.034 --> 23:58.735
As long as you're prepared to
deal with the consequences.

23:59.805 --> 24:03.073
Consequences like what?

24:06.978 --> 24:11.516
Okay. Say um, the mother
of a soldier makes a wish

24:11.517 --> 24:14.918
that she wants her son
back from the war.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.554
And she gets her wish.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.391
But, her son comes
back in a body bag.

24:25.430 --> 24:27.564
Consequences.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.566
Exactly, so...

24:44.349 --> 24:46.518
- You think I should text Terry?
- No.

24:46.519 --> 24:49.487
It's not like him to bail on a
rally, he lives for this shit.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.490
- Cassie Decker.
- Fucker.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.156
Gee.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.400
Oh, my God!

25:11.643 --> 25:13.412
- Come here.
- What?

25:13.413 --> 25:15.145
Just, come here.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.679
- What?
- Why are you so nice to me?

26:18.243 --> 26:20.010
Uh...

26:21.880 --> 26:24.114
It's kinda new to me.

26:25.951 --> 26:27.984
Is it okay?

27:09.728 --> 27:11.863
- What's wrong?
- Fuck off.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.066
Leena!

27:24.643 --> 27:27.913
Manny! Come here! I need
to talk to you for a second.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.281
Yeah.

27:29.282 --> 27:32.048
Threesome, bro.

27:32.951 --> 27:36.288
- She's really, really pissed of...
- What's up, brother?

27:36.289 --> 27:38.857
- What's left to drink.
- Uh, we've still got a few beers left.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.927
- Do I look like I want a beer?
- No, man.

27:41.928 --> 27:45.463
Oh, there he is, yo. I haven't
seen you in forever, dog. Oh, yo.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.531
Give the man a swig, yo.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.566
Hey, you want some smoke?

27:49.702 --> 27:52.235
- Oh, okay.
- No, no, no. Not you, man.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.372
Give me a smoke.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.207
No, you can't have any, dude.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.642
Goddamn, Manny.

27:57.643 --> 28:00.010
Give me a fucking hit.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.616
You good, man?

28:04.617 --> 28:07.252
You want to waste your senior
year chasing a Jesus freak

28:07.253 --> 28:09.521
who's never gonna put out?

28:09.522 --> 28:11.890
That's fine with me, cuz.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.058
What?

28:13.059 --> 28:15.560
But, if that's how it's
going to be, Manchester,

28:15.561 --> 28:19.596
your ass is going to be
warming the bench all season.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.772
Mmm. My dogs!

28:32.077 --> 28:35.680
I've been thinking. If we're
gonna go all the way, this year.

28:35.681 --> 28:40.150
We gotta shake things up. So, I'm
instituting a new team rule.

28:43.655 --> 28:46.157
No fraternizing with cheerleaders.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.193
Effective immediately.

28:48.194 --> 28:52.395
It's good enough for the NFL. It's good
enough for Blackfoot fucking high.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.300
Come on, fellas.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.202
Sack up.

28:59.838 --> 29:03.141
You're gonna realize,
I'm doing you a favor.

29:03.142 --> 29:07.010
There's a whole world
of pussy out there.

29:07.112 --> 29:08.680
Drama chicks.

29:08.681 --> 29:10.315
- Stoners.
- Mmm.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.917
Goths, smart bitches.

29:12.918 --> 29:17.020
Hell, even fat bitches got
their charms, brothers.

29:17.455 --> 29:21.591
And tomorrow, first
day of school...

29:23.528 --> 29:27.864
You're eyes are gonna be
open to a fucking gold mine.

29:28.967 --> 29:31.368
Just waiting there.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.570
Freshmen.

29:35.674 --> 29:39.177
You ain't gonna remember that cunt's
name when your balls deep in a puppy

29:39.178 --> 29:41.913
that was blowing bubbles in
the eighth grade, last spring.

29:41.914 --> 29:45.550
Fucking A, boss. That's
what I'm talking about.

29:45.551 --> 29:49.087
- All right, girls, we're leaving.
- Hell, yeah.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.222
Grab me that smoke.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.390
You're gonna let him talk to
your bitches like that, Tracy.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.026
This will stop, right
fucking now. Go!

29:55.027 --> 29:56.394
- Go.
- You know...

29:56.395 --> 29:57.829
Tracy.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.665
I'm not gonna say you
have a small dick, Terry.

30:00.666 --> 30:03.168
'Cause that would
just be predictable.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.604
I mean, it's not big,
and that's fine.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.406
But for the sake of the puppies,

30:08.407 --> 30:11.409
I just wanna make sure
you know how to use it.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.879
Three people in my 17
years have made me come.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.815
Myself, of course.

30:16.816 --> 30:20.051
This really sweet boy at summer camp
the summer after freshmen year.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.020
Lovely fingers on that boy.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.255
And then, not 10 minutes ago,

30:24.256 --> 30:29.059
I got my freaking socks
rocked off by Maddy.

30:31.129 --> 30:34.999
But, never... by you, Terry.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.836
So, you don't wanna hang
with us, this year?

30:37.837 --> 30:40.672
Well, freaking fine with me.

30:40.673 --> 30:44.109
No, no, no, no. You
can have the puppies.

30:44.110 --> 30:47.644
We'll find us some college dogs.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.816
- Get her out of here.
- Fuck you.

30:51.817 --> 30:56.254
Is a big tough guy like you scared
of a sweet little thing like me.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.456
What do you think, Maddy?

30:58.457 --> 31:02.594
Do you think I hurt Mr. Tiny
Peepee's little feelings?

31:02.595 --> 31:05.930
Oh, are you gonna cry, Terry?

31:05.931 --> 31:08.298
Huh? Are you gonna cry?

31:11.970 --> 31:15.338
Oh, my goodness! Tracy! Are you okay?

31:22.814 --> 31:27.117
You can kiss your precious
football season, goodbye, Terry.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.120
Which one of you is
gonna kick his ass?

31:32.624 --> 31:35.226
You fucking pussies!

31:35.227 --> 31:38.661
He punched Tracy.
He hit a fucking girl.

31:38.763 --> 31:40.165
Manny?

31:40.166 --> 31:42.066
Manny, do something! You asshole!

31:42.067 --> 31:43.268
Do something!

31:43.269 --> 31:45.904
Oh, my God. I'm calling the cops.

31:45.905 --> 31:49.040
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Give it back! Give it back!

31:49.041 --> 31:51.609
Hey! Hey, Terry, Terry!

31:51.610 --> 31:53.111
Are you fucking stupid?

31:53.112 --> 31:54.412
We should go.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.079
You fuck!

32:17.602 --> 32:19.669
What are you doing?

32:20.572 --> 32:22.493
What the fuck are we doing, huh?

32:24.642 --> 32:27.610
- You gotta stop.
- You worry too much, Vik.

32:29.747 --> 32:31.681
Come on, you're kidding me.

32:33.084 --> 32:34.784
Go!

32:36.521 --> 32:38.823
What the fuck are you doing?

32:42.794 --> 32:44.461
Oh, my God!

32:51.636 --> 32:53.670
Martha, you need to slow down.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.407
Fuck.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.677
There.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.821
Oh!

33:26.604 --> 33:29.138
Come on, come on.
We gotta get them out.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.878
Come on, come on!

33:33.879 --> 33:35.013
We gotta get 'em out.

33:35.014 --> 33:36.781
Oh, God! What are you doing, man?

33:36.782 --> 33:39.916
- You can't pull them out.
- We gotta get 'em out.

33:40.985 --> 33:43.221
They're gonna drown.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.225
Let go of me!

33:47.226 --> 33:49.460
Let's get in the car. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.422
Maddy!

35:15.413 --> 35:17.246
Maddy!

35:30.294 --> 35:31.961
God!

35:38.870 --> 35:41.004
Maddy! Maddy!

35:41.005 --> 35:42.839
Maddy!

35:52.350 --> 35:54.183
Maddy!

36:00.091 --> 36:01.791
No!

36:03.895 --> 36:05.895
Don't die!

36:22.747 --> 36:24.747
Don't die!

37:02.186 --> 37:04.787
Come back to me, please.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.600
Maddy!

37:55.106 --> 37:56.939
Maddy!

38:14.892 --> 38:16.893
What are you doing?

38:18.062 --> 38:19.762
Oh, shit!

38:24.101 --> 38:26.068
What happened last night?

38:27.271 --> 38:29.906
The girls, they're okay?

38:32.276 --> 38:34.110
Jesus!

38:36.781 --> 38:38.916
You don't feel anything about this?

38:38.917 --> 38:41.517
Is it our fault, chicks
can't drive for shit?

39:15.519 --> 39:17.688
Fuck, Tracy.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.157
Oh, crazy fucking dream.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.391
Well, you killed Madeline.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.761
Who's Madeline?

39:26.731 --> 39:29.432
Who's Madeline?

39:33.838 --> 39:36.138
Ugh, what are we doing here?

39:39.910 --> 39:41.711
No way!

39:42.980 --> 39:45.147
Oh, dude, your cheek.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.951
No, other cheek.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.320
Ah, don't touch it.

39:49.321 --> 39:52.523
Wait, did I break up with Terry?

39:52.524 --> 39:54.657
He punched you in the face.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.263
Oh, no, no, no.

40:00.631 --> 40:02.465
Tracy?

40:27.058 --> 40:29.026
Oh, gross!

40:29.027 --> 40:30.693
Oh, gross!

40:37.501 --> 40:39.368
Martha?

40:39.637 --> 40:41.938
- Martha?
- What?

40:42.006 --> 40:43.674
Uh, she's...

40:43.675 --> 40:45.276
I'm with...

40:45.277 --> 40:46.810
We've kinda...

40:56.721 --> 40:58.688
What is, uh, happening?

40:59.857 --> 41:02.393
Where's my phone? Where's my phone?

41:02.394 --> 41:05.474
Hanna, if you could just shut
the fuck up for two seconds.

41:05.696 --> 41:08.197
I'm not Hanna.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.634
Think. Gotta wake up. Okay.

41:12.436 --> 41:14.770
I just gotta...

41:16.308 --> 41:17.974
Eat.

41:25.349 --> 41:27.483
Friggin' goat milk.

41:52.643 --> 41:54.310
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

42:05.990 --> 42:08.391
Um, hello?

42:09.427 --> 42:11.227
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

42:11.595 --> 42:13.596
I'm Larry.

42:31.182 --> 42:33.184
God, I'm freaking starving, Larry.

42:33.185 --> 42:35.786
- Uh...
- What's for breakfast?

42:35.787 --> 42:38.522
So you told me to focus on
what I wanted, and I did.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.090
I couldn't get you to stop
panicking behind the wheel.

42:40.091 --> 42:41.258
It was Manny.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.194
- I remember that and then...
- So, now...

42:43.195 --> 42:44.662
Now I can be with Manny.

42:44.663 --> 42:46.297
And the car was full of water
and everything is upside down.

42:46.298 --> 42:48.766
I mean, I'm sure the stones are
just trying to get us back,

42:48.767 --> 42:50.301
- right?
- I'm trying to get us out, but I can't

42:50.302 --> 42:51.869
- Right?
- because of the fucking child locks.

42:51.870 --> 42:53.736
It was my fault.

42:56.640 --> 43:00.443
I crashed us and now,
God is punishing me.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.712
Martha was driving.

43:01.713 --> 43:03.080
- I was.
- She was.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.449
Oh, my God. I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

43:05.450 --> 43:08.951
I'm the only one you could
kill at this point, Maddy.

43:11.121 --> 43:13.355
Because you died last night.

43:15.292 --> 43:17.760
All four of you died.

43:20.664 --> 43:22.166
Uh...

43:22.167 --> 43:24.568
Real milk.

43:24.569 --> 43:29.039
The bitches think I'm crazy, but,
I drink like half a gallon a day.

43:29.040 --> 43:33.177
I've kept my mouth shut about you
and your mom's crazy wicca bullshit

43:33.178 --> 43:35.746
for as long as I
possibly can, Leena.

43:35.747 --> 43:38.949
- What's a wicca?
- No, it's not exactly as wicca.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.759
- Leena's a witch.
- That's not nice, Maddy.

43:41.760 --> 43:45.354
- You shouldn't call people names.
- No, she's right.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.724
- I am a witch.
- At least she thinks she is.

43:59.503 --> 44:01.504
Are you okay?

44:08.846 --> 44:11.248
- I feel good.
- Maybe, maybe...

44:11.249 --> 44:14.552
You should go lay down.

44:14.553 --> 44:17.753
At your own house. I mean, you
should lay down at your own house.

44:19.523 --> 44:21.490
My head's hot.

44:24.428 --> 44:26.729
It is hot.

44:29.266 --> 44:31.400
The rest of you is cold.

44:31.702 --> 44:33.437
And then you start stalking me?

44:33.438 --> 44:36.473
When you have no idea
the shit that I'm up to.

44:36.474 --> 44:39.043
No idea what I'm going through.
You think everything is about you.

44:39.044 --> 44:42.379
That is your problem, Leena. You
think everything I do is about...

44:42.380 --> 44:44.615
What are you doing?

44:44.616 --> 44:46.116
You feel mine, right?

44:46.117 --> 44:48.617
Oh, what? Your broken
heart? Give me a break.

44:51.355 --> 44:53.822
What do you feel now?

44:56.193 --> 44:59.361
We can hear the sound
of your heart.

45:03.734 --> 45:05.135
You can...

45:05.136 --> 45:06.503
What?

45:06.504 --> 45:08.470
What did you do?

45:08.739 --> 45:10.539
I saved you.

45:17.581 --> 45:19.248
Wait a minute.

45:54.618 --> 45:56.252
Leena!

45:58.856 --> 46:00.090
Leena!

46:00.091 --> 46:02.192
I'm sorry, Larry.

46:02.193 --> 46:04.127
I think, my friends are hungry.

46:04.128 --> 46:05.894
What?

46:05.963 --> 46:08.030
Are you kidding me?

46:12.069 --> 46:14.069
This is... This is, uh...

46:57.214 --> 46:59.581
I feel freaking fantastic.

47:00.517 --> 47:02.584
Do you, um...

47:03.153 --> 47:06.188
All feel better?

47:06.190 --> 47:08.090
Stronger?

47:10.795 --> 47:13.996
Yes! Oh, my God! Yes!

47:14.898 --> 47:16.266
It worked!

47:16.267 --> 47:18.402
What works, this?

47:18.403 --> 47:20.804
My crazy wicca bullshit, it works!

47:20.805 --> 47:22.106
These work.

47:22.107 --> 47:24.341
Then why am I in my
sister's body, Leena?

47:24.342 --> 47:25.642
Why would you do that to me?

47:25.643 --> 47:27.377
I don't know, I wasn't
trying to, Martha.

47:27.378 --> 47:30.047
You can change us back, right?

47:30.048 --> 47:31.281
I don't know.

47:31.282 --> 47:34.451
Chop, chop, girls. School's, like, in
a half hour, we totally got to go.

47:34.452 --> 47:35.953
Who's driving?

47:35.954 --> 47:38.055
My car broke down last
night, we walked here.

47:38.056 --> 47:41.959
Shit! I can't be seen walking
to school on the first day.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.862
Fuck school. Look at what we
just did to Leena's neighbor.

47:44.863 --> 47:47.464
Whatever. We can sit
around and sing Kumbaya

47:47.465 --> 47:48.999
if it's gonna make you
feel better, but...

47:49.000 --> 47:51.969
- Tracy, shut the fuck up.
- Sure, I'll shut the fuck up

47:51.970 --> 47:54.404
as soon as someone tells me
who's driving me to school.

47:54.405 --> 47:57.039
Uh, what about his car?

48:22.699 --> 48:25.859
You weren't wrong about the hot
young tail up in this bitch, huh?

48:26.904 --> 48:29.339
Ladies...

48:29.340 --> 48:33.275
Let me the first to welcome
you to Blackfoot High.

48:34.178 --> 48:35.512
I'm Terry.

48:35.513 --> 48:38.816
- We know who you are.
- Yeah, we do.

48:38.817 --> 48:42.686
This here is the star
quarterback, Mr. Vik De Palma.

48:42.687 --> 48:46.190
Go ahead. Feel the arm,
girls. Don't be shy.

48:46.191 --> 48:48.192
There's more than
enough to go around.

48:48.193 --> 48:49.958
It's so hard.

48:52.830 --> 48:56.131
Can you give some
love to my boy, Manny

48:56.567 --> 48:58.434
And Ben.

48:58.535 --> 48:59.603
Hi, guys!

48:59.604 --> 49:00.671
Hey.

49:00.672 --> 49:02.272
Give them some love.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.808
My dogs bleed on the field
every day for this school.

49:04.809 --> 49:06.508
Wow.

49:08.145 --> 49:10.625
- Do you have Facebook?
- So, how's the...

49:11.882 --> 49:13.383
Fuck!

49:13.384 --> 49:15.317
I like your shirt.

49:15.552 --> 49:17.453
So, let's talk soon.

49:21.391 --> 49:23.292
Hi, Vik!

49:25.229 --> 49:26.995
Are you okay?

49:28.098 --> 49:29.798
No.

49:32.336 --> 49:34.236
Can I talk to you for a second?

49:35.505 --> 49:36.740
Yeah, of course. Come on.

49:36.741 --> 49:38.308
Clear the road, puppies.

49:38.309 --> 49:41.244
Bloodhound bitches
in the house, ya'll.

50:59.823 --> 51:01.557
Vik?

51:08.298 --> 51:10.968
Look at her in that suit,
she looks like such a slut.

51:10.969 --> 51:12.102
Mmm-hmm.

51:12.103 --> 51:14.369
Psst! Yo, bitch!

51:35.525 --> 51:37.160
Cell phones off, people.

51:37.161 --> 51:39.895
What are the odds, Ben.
We're table mates.

51:42.232 --> 51:44.601
It sounded like...

51:44.602 --> 51:47.002
You're speaking my language.

51:49.506 --> 51:51.640
You guys are okay?

51:53.510 --> 51:54.811
Sure.

51:54.812 --> 51:58.125
We tried to help you guys,
we just... We... You know,

51:58.126 --> 52:01.117
- we couldn't get down there...
- Hey, hey, hey.

52:01.118 --> 52:03.518
No harm, no foul, right?

52:05.789 --> 52:09.124
Get me high after class,
we'll call it even.

52:20.370 --> 52:22.939
Oh, shave my ball sack.

52:22.940 --> 52:24.641
- Leena. Leena Miller.
- Who?

52:24.642 --> 52:26.510
Leena Miller. I'm not
fucking with you, dude.

52:26.511 --> 52:28.745
She was making these little
stones float in the air.

52:28.746 --> 52:31.415
- It was fucking magic, dude.
- Oh, it's fucking magic, dude.

52:31.416 --> 52:34.549
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you.

52:37.020 --> 52:39.187
What's up, Terry?

53:18.062 --> 53:21.063
Wow, Hanna. Didn't
know you had tits.

53:21.064 --> 53:22.732
If she's a dog.

53:22.733 --> 53:26.001
She must have six more
hidden somewhere, dude.

53:31.741 --> 53:35.811
So, there's two things you
gotta know about George's van.

53:36.947 --> 53:40.016
One, there's always a weed stash.

53:40.017 --> 53:43.318
And two, it's never locked.

53:47.357 --> 53:50.292
And three, it smells like dick.

54:02.672 --> 54:05.474
Hi, guys! Terry, how's your hand?

54:06.776 --> 54:09.279
Punched his girlfriend in the
face. I mean, you know.

54:09.280 --> 54:12.481
That shit can hurt the puncher
as much as the punchee, so...

54:14.284 --> 54:17.219
Maddy and I had a little
fling over the summer.

54:18.622 --> 54:21.189
I guess she's still
a bit sore from it.

54:23.827 --> 54:28.563
All right, we're gonna go.
We'll see you guys later.

54:30.734 --> 54:33.235
Remember the buddy system, girls.

54:38.675 --> 54:42.310
There's only one outcome when
people play games with me, Maddy.

54:43.246 --> 54:45.981
- They lose.
- Playtime's over, Terry.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.518
What happened last night?

54:50.120 --> 54:52.656
You know, before last night,

54:52.657 --> 54:54.958
I was just gonna ruin
your senior year.

54:54.959 --> 54:58.693
But now... I'm gonna
have to kill you.

54:58.995 --> 55:01.096
Just watch your mouth, dyke.

55:01.865 --> 55:03.565
Oh!

55:05.802 --> 55:07.502
Oh!

55:08.538 --> 55:10.238
Ah!

55:12.542 --> 55:14.242
Ah!

55:18.515 --> 55:20.215
Ah!

55:20.951 --> 55:22.617
Let's go, man.

55:23.253 --> 55:25.086
Let's go!

55:42.572 --> 55:44.374
Uh, what the fuck is going on?

55:44.375 --> 55:47.876
Somebody got fucked, somebody
got killed and I'm going to PE.

55:53.783 --> 55:55.450
Come on.

55:57.988 --> 56:01.656
Martha! I'm so, so
happy you're okay.

56:02.892 --> 56:06.561
I was drunk and I was stoned,
I didn't know what to...

56:36.393 --> 56:38.326
For real?

56:50.407 --> 56:52.674
- Right.
- Mmm-hmm.

56:56.646 --> 56:58.346
Whoa!

57:00.150 --> 57:01.816
Wow!

57:05.388 --> 57:07.555
Oh, my goodness.

57:09.826 --> 57:10.894
What?

57:10.895 --> 57:11.961
Jesus Christ, Martha.

57:11.962 --> 57:13.496
Shit, I didn't mean
to say his name.

57:13.497 --> 57:15.699
I know you hate that.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

57:15.700 --> 57:16.866
Did I do it again?

57:16.867 --> 57:18.401
Oh, Jesus Christ.

57:18.402 --> 57:20.201
Wanna see something?

57:20.837 --> 57:22.105
Yeah.

57:22.106 --> 57:23.873
You sure you want our
first time to be here?

57:23.874 --> 57:25.675
- In the handicap bathroom?
- Mmm-hmm

57:25.676 --> 57:27.777
- Yeah.
- I love you, Martha.

57:27.778 --> 57:30.780
- I want you to call me Hanna.
- What?

57:30.781 --> 57:32.714
Check this out.

57:35.952 --> 57:38.420
Oh, shit!

57:38.855 --> 57:40.690
Tracy, that...

57:40.691 --> 57:43.491
Fucking disgusting.

57:44.861 --> 57:47.429
Please, just call me Hanna.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.432
Okay. Hanna.

57:50.767 --> 57:52.001
Okay.

57:52.002 --> 57:54.302
- Okay.
- Oh, I love you Hanna!

57:57.674 --> 57:59.242
Oh.

57:59.243 --> 58:02.677
Uh, are you okay?

58:02.846 --> 58:05.347
- Yeah!
- Oh, it's cold.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.182
Ugh!

58:07.217 --> 58:08.984
It's cold.

58:11.821 --> 58:14.991
Oh, it's cold.

58:39.249 --> 58:42.152
Oh, help me, Jesus.

58:42.153 --> 58:43.453
Oh, help me, Jesus.

59:23.426 --> 59:25.862
- There you go.
- Yeah, you can do it. It's nice.

59:25.863 --> 59:29.130
- So, how are you feeling? It's all right.
- Feeling good?

59:30.700 --> 59:32.367
Oh, shit.

59:51.554 --> 59:53.356
Uh, what the fuck is going on?

59:53.357 --> 59:57.125
Somebody got fucked, somebody
got killed and I'm going to PE.

59:57.927 --> 59:59.996
We should never have
come to school.

59:59.997 --> 01:00:02.265
Hey, bitches!

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:05.033
- Who was it?
- What do you mean?

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:09.472
Ben.

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:13.009
At least it's not more
innocent blood on our hands.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.243
No more feeding at school.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:27.755
Don't do that.

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:38.566
Anyone else seen this?

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:40.635
No.

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.271
Let's keep it that way.

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.850
- Sorry, Nicholas.
- Asshole!

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:08.997
I've been waiting for
this for so long.

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:21.644
- Vik. Dude, it happened.
- What's up?

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:25.014
- What happened?
- Dude, me, Martha, the handicap bathroom.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:28.685
Dude, I was all up in that
sweet, sweet freezer.

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:30.320
What freezer? What are
you talking about?

01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:32.954
- Hey, I didn't even know.
- Know what?

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.593
That it's cold in there.

01:01:36.594 --> 01:01:38.594
Uh... I don't even...

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:41.622
It's supposed to be
cold in there, right?

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.667
Manny...

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.070
Oh, hey, Hanna.

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.272
Come with me.

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:51.608
No, I got trig. I gotta go.

01:01:51.609 --> 01:01:53.969
But, Martha asked me
to bring you to her.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.646
- Where is she?
- The sticks.

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:59.875
- Said she wanted to see you in private.
- Really?

01:01:59.876 --> 01:02:02.218
But I'll just tell her
you've got trigonometry.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.485
What? No. Are you serious?

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.318
Uh.

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.422
Martha?

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:41.089
How could you do it?

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:46.060
How could you have sex...

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:49.063
With my sister.

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.200
She's my girlfriend.

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:53.069
No, I'm your girlfriend.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:56.288
Um, I can't miss class for
whatever this is, Hanna,

01:02:56.289 --> 01:02:59.841
- so why don't you...
- No, you stop right there, Mr. Man.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:06.180
Hanna, you're a...

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:10.520
You're a sweet kid. But, you don't
need to be like your sister.

01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:14.455
I love her, but everybody hates it

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:19.627
when she pulls that
prissy, bossy bullshit.

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:44.552
Ahhh!

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.572
Close your eyes.

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:48.050
Fuck!

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.019
Shit, Maddy, my stones are gone.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.021
Somebody stole them.
Do you think it was Terry?

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:54.956
Well, who else?

01:04:56.459 --> 01:05:00.630
- You okay?
- No. I'm sluggish.

01:05:00.631 --> 01:05:04.332
- And that sucks.
- It's okay, you just need blood.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.100
Leena.

01:05:07.805 --> 01:05:09.871
Here, drink from me.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.684
Come on. Let's find the
others and get out of here.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:56.285
- Practice time, bitches.
- What?

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.955
We're not slacking on my
watch, big game Friday night.

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.656
Okay, did you feed again?

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:02.992
No, you said not to.
I'm a team player.

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:04.861
Somebody did and...

01:06:04.862 --> 01:06:07.530
- Terry stole my stones.
- Okay, enough already.

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:09.031
Bitches and I got work to do.

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:10.965
Come on, Mads.

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.839
- You've seen Vik?
- No.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.276
- What about Manny?
- No, not since lunch.

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:23.646
- You thinking what I'm thinking, boss?
- What are you thinking, Shank?

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:26.781
That voodoo dyke and her bitches
are picking us dogs off.

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.718
One by one.

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:31.786
Bitches glowing like Lite-Brites
and shit. You saw it.

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.789
Look, I've been thinking a lot.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.993
- About borrowing your sister's clothes?
- Don't be an asshole, Vik.

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:38.561
- No, fuck you guys.
- You're being a pussy.

01:06:38.562 --> 01:06:39.662
- Find yourself a new quarterback.
- You're being a pussy.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.462
- Fuck you.
- Pussy.

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:50.204
You think I'm gonna let you quit?

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:03.853
Hey, Dad. Me and the
bitches, the girls,

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:07.323
um, we are going to be staying
at Maddy's house tonight,

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:10.092
because we have a
whole lot of cheers

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:12.228
that we have to go over and
practice and everything.

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:15.631
So, I guess we'll be
seeing you tomorrow.

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:20.201
Uh, don't work too hard. We
love you. Okay, bye, Dad. Bye.

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:26.774
So, I just have to do
this all the time now.

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.479
- Where did you get that?
- None of your beeswax.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.681
Can I use it a minute?

01:07:31.682 --> 01:07:33.149
I'm just gonna keep
killing innocent people.

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:36.118
Am I the only one that
gives a shit about that.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:36.770
Come on, Martha,

01:07:36.771 --> 01:07:38.321
- I need to check Facebook.
- No.

01:07:38.322 --> 01:07:40.790
You don't have to kill,
we can do it this way.

01:07:40.791 --> 01:07:42.124
- Martha!
- Leave me alone!

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:43.726
Martha, chill!

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:45.128
Tracy, you can use my computer.

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:48.798
Hanna, Leena, look after these
bitches. I gotta go take a shower.

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:51.801
We're family now. Like it
or not, families fight.

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:54.403
Yeah, well, I don't really
need a family, so...

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.604
Well, what if we need you, Maddy?

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.477
Goddamn, boss.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.180
Taking it to the next level.

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:12.954
Let's get Vik.

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:56.064
Why do you have Manny's phone?

01:08:56.066 --> 01:08:57.733
Because Manny was a jerk.

01:08:57.734 --> 01:08:59.902
You should see what these
texts say about me.

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:03.104
Okay, what do you
mean he was a jerk?

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:08.075
What do you think I mean?

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:12.715
You shouldn't have
done that, Martha.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:15.251
Shut up, Leena. You
don't even know me.

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:16.752
Oh!

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:18.921
Hanna, no. Wait. You need
blood, you're weak right now.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.823
Okay, Hanna is a little weakling.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:24.024
- No, I wasn't saying that.
- Fuck off, witch.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.796
God!

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:30.296
Sorry, Leena. I just
need to be alone, okay?

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:32.334
- I have to go.
- Hanna!

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:35.469
Bonus, K-Mads keeps a video diary.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:48.283
Vik's gone, his bike's gone.

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.519
I told you he'd queef and run.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.555
<i>The hard part is going to be, pretending
that I actually like those dumb bitches.</i>

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:59.261
<i>Like that dipshit, Tracy.</i>

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:02.264
<i>Acts like she's all sad but
then, jumps on Terry's jock</i>

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:06.133
<i>before Alexis is even in
the ground. That's classy.</i>

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:09.303
<i>And Terry.</i>

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:13.476
<i>Mr. big bad wolf himself.</i>

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:18.247
<i>I'm gonna ruin your perfect
little senior year, dog.</i>

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:22.084
<i>But, right now. I have to go and
paint my face up like those whores.</i>

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:25.019
<i>So, uh... Maddy Killian, out!</i>

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.527
Tracy.

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:35.663
Tracy, that was like a week
ago. I didn't know you then.

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.369
I'm taking Larry's car.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.637
No, we have to stay together.

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:44.839
I'm not asking.

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:47.143
Give me a ride.

01:10:47.144 --> 01:10:50.679
You don't let me borrow your phone but,
you expect me to give your ass a ride?

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.816
- No, no. You have to listen.
- Cassie Decker.

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:55.950
Is that true?

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:01.822
- Wait.
- No!

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:08.335
I thought you were being nice
to me because you liked me.

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:15.504
This is all your fault.

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:18.205
Tracy, wait. You can use my phone.

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:29.218
What did he do to you?

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.420
Tracy!

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:34.255
Tracy!

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:36.757
After Lexi died...

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:41.128
I felt like I needed to do
something nice for her.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:45.901
So, I started to make
her a tribute video.

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:49.003
I wanted to interview
all of her friends.

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:53.007
Terry always seemed
kind of pompous, but...

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.712
All of a sudden, he was
just a regular guy.

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:02.351
<i>I felt sorry for him.</i>

01:12:02.352 --> 01:12:06.053
That's why I didn't think twice
about going to his place to talk.

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.458
Martha?

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.737
Just kinda laughed it off at first.

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:26.073
I said no thanks.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.810
Then his eyes changed.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:34.014
How could someone like me

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:36.851
turn him down.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:44.026
Grab her! Grab her! The other side!

01:12:44.995 --> 01:12:47.194
Punched me in the stomach.

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.897
And then he...

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.810
I think you need to say it.

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:09.751
He raped me.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.167
Hanna!

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:23.090
She's got me, boss. She's got me.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.193
You killed Hanna!

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:52.421
- Just forget about them.
- Leena, they're our friends.

01:14:52.422 --> 01:14:54.022
Martha! Tracy!

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:57.057
You need blood, you're not
strong enough for this.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.431
- Maddy, are you okay?
- What did you guys do?

01:15:02.432 --> 01:15:04.266
What are you talking about?

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.535
I didn't do anything. I'm not
with Terry, I came here for you.

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:08.902
I don't need you to rescue me, Vik.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.147
Maddy! No, no!

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.421
Let her go.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:31.125
Whoo!

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.527
I can't move.

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:37.297
I never understood why you
had the hots for her, Viky.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.267
Till I fucked her, this summer.

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.903
She puts up a good fight.

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:46.141
Who are you, man?

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:48.342
I'm your best friend, bud.

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.512
I broke her in for
you and everything.

01:15:50.513 --> 01:15:52.212
Vik?

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:55.816
Hey, Vik, I need your help.

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:58.352
Yeah.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:11.233
Oh, you are such a
little bitch, Vik.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.367
I owe it to you, too, cuz.

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:18.105
You want her? Come and get her.

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:21.109
You girls got your seatbelts on?

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.845
Oh!

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.014
Whoa!

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:12.888
Tastes like jellybeans.

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:15.223
I'm like the Cookie
Monster up in this bitch.

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:18.091
Oh, I hope that shit
was gluten free.

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:27.334
Come on, bitches.

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:28.971
- Terry!
- Maddy!

01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:31.506
<i>♪ I don't know but I've been told</i>

01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:34.476
<i>♪ Killing pussies, going home ♪</i>

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:38.545
Mad, we have to do this together!

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:39.815
Whoa!

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:41.749
Maddy! Maddy!

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.584
Maddy!

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.865
No!

01:19:01.703 --> 01:19:03.105
Oh, my God!

01:19:03.106 --> 01:19:04.938
Terry!

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:21.622
No, no, no, no.

01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:23.790
Maddy!

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:33.433
Come on, Leena. We gotta talk.

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:41.275
You're gonna tell me
how to use these.

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:46.915
She just died, didn't she?

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:48.483
Again.

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:51.785
Trap must've ripped that
stone right out of her.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.989
And you feel it.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:55.656
Is that it?

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:58.992
But I feel fucking great.

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.296
Why is that?

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:02.898
Because you're an interloper.

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:05.565
- Like a free agent?
- More like a leech.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.911
I'm so sorry.

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:25.152
What can I do with these?

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.854
You wanna show me?

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.825
Or...

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:34.629
I can see what happens...

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:37.364
When I carve that one
out of your throat.

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.100
No.

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:46.773
- It's your call.
- No, you...

01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:51.678
Holy shit!

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:58.085
I've never done that before.

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.066
Ah!

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:14.870
This is a new and improved Terry.

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:19.007
Oh, it's gonna be a hell
of a season thanks to you.

01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:22.843
You know, I never did get
a straight answer on that.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:25.013
Girlfriend?

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:27.180
Ex-girlfriend?

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:32.886
Girlfriend, bitch!

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:45.165
No!

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.667
No!

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.972
No!

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.650
Ah, no!

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.331
Maddy!

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.500
No, no!

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:58.939
No! No!

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:02.010
No! You're not leaving me.

01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:04.512
I won't let you go.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:29.003
Crazy wicca bullshit.
