We don't know Kathryn's pregnant.

31:13.998 --> 31:16.159
Doesn't matter. You chose her.

31:16.250 --> 31:19.367
I know.
But I still have feelings for you.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.421
You can't have both.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.087
But I do have both.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.416
I know. I know it doesn't make sense.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.969
But it's like I have
these two conflicting lives.

31:30.097 --> 31:32.088
Memories Of feelings for her,

31:33.809 --> 31:35.219
and real feelings for you.

I know. Me tOO.

31:45.946 --> 31:48.653
But we're going to have to.

31:48.783 --> 31:50.774
We're just going
to have to forget each other.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.704
SO you're the one.

32:00.795 --> 32:01.875
I don't know what you're...

32:01.962 --> 32:03.793
Enough. I know everything.

You've poisoned his heart,
now his marriage.

32:08.677 --> 32:12.795
And with that, the entire kingdom.
All because Of your feelings.

32:13.307 --> 32:14.843
I wish feelings could be helped,
but they can't.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.511
Of course they can.

32:17.019 --> 32:18.134
Love is a disease.

32:18.646 --> 32:22.138
And like all diseases it can be
vanquished in one Of two ways.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.139
A cure, or death.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.977
DO you know where
your beloved is right now?

32:28.322 --> 32:32.156
He's right down that hallway,
packing for his new life.

32:32.243 --> 32:33.824
And he'll never know I'm here.

32:33.911 --> 32:34.900
Oh, yes, he will.

32:35.955 --> 32:38.913
Because you are gonna walk
down that hallway, Snow White.

32:38.999 --> 32:42.583
You're gonna sneak in and tell him
you received his letter.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.410
You're gonna tell him
why you're here.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.083
Because you don't love him.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.675
It'II break his heart.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.171
And that will cure him.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.510
Or you'll kill me.

32:53.639 --> 32:54.845
Oh, nO.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.634
I'll kill him.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.008
Killing you would just
make him love you more

32:59.145 --> 33:01.978
and the marriage and the kingdom
would ultimately crumble.

33:02.523 --> 33:06.015
But if he were to die at an assassin's
hand, he would die a martyr.

33:06.277 --> 33:08.643
Midas would forgive,
even laud, the death.

33:08.946 --> 33:10.652
And the merger would be complete.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.281
You would do that to your own son?

You're here. We can gO. We can be
together. We can leave all this.

that you love me tOO...

I don't.

there is no place for us together.

but it's also been hard on me.

And when the test came back negative,
at first I was upset,

36:37.363 --> 36:39.900
but then lwas relieved.

36:41.075 --> 36:42.281
We're not ready.

it would be a disaster.
