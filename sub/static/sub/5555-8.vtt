is going on with Beckett,

04:15.846 --> 04:19.214

04:19.250 --> 04:21.117
Looks like she was killed
execution style,

04:21.152 --> 04:22.285
then dumped in the water.

of Iconic Cruise Lines."

So, our Jane Doe must have been
a cruise-ship entertainer.

04:34.298 --> 04:37.300
So she could have been killed
aboard any ship in the Atlantic

04:37.334 --> 04:38.535
and drifted here
on the currents.

04:38.569 --> 04:42.806
Or not. Based on the modest
level of blanching and bloating,

04:42.840 --> 04:45.508
her body's been in the water
less than 10 to 12 hours.

04:45.543 --> 04:47.944

could still be nearby.

this Jane Doe could have had a
little side business smuggling.

to sell drugs.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.152

a captive customer base.

05:29.186 --> 05:31.788

in a little on-board turf war,

05:31.822 --> 05:33.623
and the competition
took her out.

05:33.657 --> 05:35.291

05:35.326 --> 05:37.327
I mean, if she
was an actual mule,

- we'd be pulling out 20 of those.
- At least.

05:40.231 --> 05:42.002
I'll put a rush on this
at the lab.

05:42.055 --> 05:42.999
Meanwhile, we need to figure out

05:43.033 --> 05:45.969
which iconic cruise ship
our Jane Doe was on,

05:46.003 --> 05:47.937
because <i>that's our crime scene.</i>

05:52.943 --> 05:55.145
Ryan: I just got off the phone
with Iconic Cruise Lines.

05:55.179 --> 05:57.080
Our victim is Lara Madden.

05:57.114 --> 05:59.249
She was a dancer in their show
called "Speakeasy."

05:59.283 --> 06:01.317
Apparently she performed in it
last night.

06:01.352 --> 06:03.219
Okay, well, that
explains the flapper dress.

06:03.254 --> 06:04.120
And the boat she worked on

06:04.155 --> 06:06.623
is an old "Titanic"-era-themed oceanliner

06:06.657 --> 06:08.291
named the RMS <i>Bently.</i>

06:08.325 --> 06:10.827
It put into port at Manhattan
cruise terminal at dawn.

06:10.861 --> 06:11.828
Hmm.

06:11.862 --> 06:13.563
Michigan I.D.?

06:13.597 --> 06:15.165
You contact her next-of-kin?

06:15.199 --> 06:17.300
Yeah, her mother
is flying in later today.

06:17.334 --> 06:20.804
She said that Lara quit her job
at an environmental nonprofit

06:20.838 --> 06:22.438
in order to work
on the cruise line,

06:22.473 --> 06:24.240
all to help her family
get out of debt.

06:24.275 --> 06:26.109
Esposito: Perlmutter just called.

06:26.143 --> 06:27.677
Turns out that baggie
from Lara's stomach...

06:27.711 --> 06:30.313
- Pure uncut heroin.
- Uncut?

06:30.347 --> 06:32.348
No wonder she only swallowed
one baggie.

06:32.383 --> 06:34.317
That 8-ball
has a street value of $30k.

06:34.351 --> 06:36.186
Uncut heroin
comes directly from the cartel,

06:36.220 --> 06:38.354
so how does a dancer from
Michigan get her hands on that?

06:38.389 --> 06:40.156
It could have came
from anybody on the ship.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.358
The problem is,
all of our suspects

06:42.393 --> 06:43.426
disembarked this morning.

06:43.460 --> 06:44.661
Yeah, like 2,000 of them.

06:44.695 --> 06:45.695
They're probably
all over the city

06:45.729 --> 06:47.263
or flying back to wherever
they came from by now.

06:47.298 --> 06:51.034
Okay, why don't you guys run the names
from all the passenger and crew manifests?

06:51.068 --> 06:52.135
See if anything pops.

06:52.169 --> 06:53.937
I'll head off to the ship,

06:53.971 --> 06:55.939
see if I can find
an actual crime scene.

06:55.973 --> 06:57.106

06:57.141 --> 06:59.542
Janice: Here at iconic, we
pride ourselves on two things...

06:59.577 --> 07:02.178
The old-world elegance
of ocean travel

07:02.213 --> 07:04.347
and our
impeccable safety record.

07:04.381 --> 07:06.549
So I'm sure
whatever happened to Lara

07:06.584 --> 07:08.484
was simply a tragic accident.

07:08.519 --> 07:10.787
Uh, well, she was
shot in the head,

07:10.821 --> 07:14.190
so unless she tripped and fell on
a bullet, it wasn't an accident.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.560
Now, I thought that all of your
passengers disembarked this morning.

07:17.595 --> 07:20.163
Oh, those are some
of the ship's resident guests,

07:20.197 --> 07:22.398
mostly retirees
who live aboard yearround.

07:22.433 --> 07:23.867
Some of them,
like the Nelson sisters,

07:23.901 --> 07:26.336
have been on the ship longer than
most of the crew. [Cellphone rings]

07:33.711 --> 07:35.178
Vikram: We hit the mother lode.

07:35.212 --> 07:36.813
I ran the heroin
found in our victim's stomach.

07:36.847 --> 07:39.315
Beckett,
it's an exact 100% match

07:39.350 --> 07:40.994
to the heroin
Vulcan Simmons was selling.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.452
So Lara's killer is linked

07:42.486 --> 07:45.188
to whoever took over
vulcan's drug pipeline.

07:45.222 --> 07:48.191
This is it...
What we've been waiting for.

07:48.225 --> 07:50.860
And do you believe it came
from one of our own cases?

07:50.895 --> 07:51.995
Okay, we have to be careful.

07:52.029 --> 07:54.831
We can't let on that we know
anything and blow our cover.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.517

the target in the CIA.

07:56.649 --> 07:57.506

talked about buying a boat.

09:00.985 --> 09:02.719
They can't afford the bad press.

09:02.753 --> 09:05.055
Stop this ship, or I will
charge you with obstruction.

09:05.089 --> 09:07.324
I can call the coast guard
to interdict this vessel.

09:07.358 --> 09:08.391
Sure, you can.

09:08.426 --> 09:09.593
But you know as well as I do

09:09.627 --> 09:10.794
that by the time
you activate them,

09:10.828 --> 09:12.162
we'll be
in international waters.

09:12.196 --> 09:14.498
Where U.S. laws don't apply.

09:14.532 --> 09:15.932
That's what
iconic is counting on.

09:15.967 --> 09:17.033
Oh, and just so
the two of you know,

09:17.068 --> 09:19.169
they're sending a boat
to pick you up in about an hour.

09:19.203 --> 09:21.137
So we've got 60 minutes
to investigate this murder

09:21.172 --> 09:22.973
before we lose access
to our crime scene.

09:23.007 --> 09:23.874
- And about that...
- Really?

09:23.908 --> 09:25.942
I've been instructed
to order the crew

09:25.977 --> 09:26.776
not to cooperate with you.

09:26.811 --> 09:29.446
Hey, I'm not losing my job
over this.

09:30.756 --> 09:32.082
We got to divide and conquer.

09:32.116 --> 09:33.917
Right. I'll talk
to Lara's dancer friends.

09:33.951 --> 09:35.752
They may be the last ones
to see her alive.

09:35.786 --> 09:37.921
Okay, but just remember, they're
not supposed to cooperate,

09:37.955 --> 09:39.424
so don't tell them that
you're working with the police.

09:39.450 --> 09:40.857
Where will you be?

09:40.892 --> 09:42.826
There are three Marthas
on lido deck.

09:42.860 --> 09:45.595
If anyone knows anything about
this ship, it's gonna be them.

09:45.630 --> 09:47.364
And plus,
they're not with the crew.

09:47.398 --> 09:49.099
All right, if they're
anything like my mother,

09:49.133 --> 09:51.034
you're gonna have
your hands full.

10:01.246 --> 10:02.479
So, some rich guy bought

10:02.513 --> 10:05.182
the "be part of the show" dance
package for our next cruise.

10:05.216 --> 10:09.653
And I promise
not to step on anyone's toes.

10:09.687 --> 10:11.088

10:11.122 --> 10:14.691
Yeah, I boarded early in hopes of
getting a little extra rehearsal time.

10:14.726 --> 10:16.727
Well, I'm not sure how
you boarded early, Mr. Schirmer,

10:16.761 --> 10:18.729

Mr. Schirmer is my father.

- At your service.

10:27.205 --> 10:29.873
Well, Dave, I'm sorry, rehearsal's
not part of the dance package.

10:29.907 --> 10:32.709

an extra $100 in it for you.

on a cruise about a month ago.

He said there was a dancer here
by the name of Lara

10:46.824 --> 10:48.592
who was very helpful...
Is she here today?

10:48.626 --> 10:50.394
Actually, Lara's a no-show
for today.

10:50.428 --> 10:52.763
But if you want to meet her, you
can ask her bunkmate, Bethany.

10:52.797 --> 10:53.797
Thank you.

10:53.831 --> 10:55.799
So, Dave, uh, according
to your questionnaire,

10:55.833 --> 10:57.734
you have professional
dance experience, right?

10:57.769 --> 10:58.869
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

10:58.903 --> 11:00.704
And you studied the video
we sent?

11:00.738 --> 11:02.639
- Yes, of course.
- Perfect.

for our chats.

12:08.206 --> 12:09.773

so much about Lara?

on board connected to drugs.

- Isaac Dern.

12:43.207 --> 12:45.909
that he and Lara
like to <i>hang out</i> together.

to ports around the world,

18:19.544 --> 18:22.145
He followed her after the show,
and then he killed her.

18:22.180 --> 18:22.980
We got to find him.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.214
15 minutes.

18:24.249 --> 18:25.849
- Divide and conquer?
- Divide and conquer.

18:25.883 --> 18:28.051
Okay, go to the dancers.
See if they know who he is.

18:28.086 --> 18:29.686
I'll go to the operations deck.

18:32.757 --> 18:35.726
Beckett: Um, excuse me,
I'm looking for Acosta.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.027
He's down there.

18:59.817 --> 19:02.819
Acosta? We need to talk.

19:05.723 --> 19:07.024
[Clanking]

[Gate creaking]

19:56.541 --> 19:57.574
Don't move.

19:57.608 --> 20:00.010
You're under arrest
for the murder of Lara Madden.

20:06.001 --> 20:10.271
[Police radio chatter]

20:10.306 --> 20:12.107
So he wants an attorney.

20:12.141 --> 20:14.442
The public defender's office
is sending someone over now.

20:14.477 --> 20:16.311
Yeah, this guy is dirty as hell.

20:16.345 --> 20:18.279
He's connected
to the Los Zetas drug cartel.

20:18.314 --> 20:20.418
Well, look what we found on him.

20:22.585 --> 20:24.586
[Cellphone rings]
He circled his prey.

20:26.895 --> 20:27.422
[Beep]

20:27.456 --> 20:28.890
This is Richard Castle.

20:28.924 --> 20:31.292
I take it that you're not alone.

20:31.327 --> 20:33.221
No, not at all.

20:34.096 --> 20:36.397
You should probably make it back
here... I found something.

20:36.432 --> 20:37.632
All right, I'll see you soon.

20:37.666 --> 20:41.136
Sorry, guys. Got to take off.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.338
Beckett: Hey, uh, Rick?

20:44.106 --> 20:45.728
Thanks for today.

20:46.175 --> 20:47.709
My pleasure.

20:47.743 --> 20:50.378
- Hey, Beckett, you got a second?
- Uh, yeah.

20:52.581 --> 20:54.749
I watched the rest of the
footage from Lara's camera.

20:54.784 --> 20:56.384
What I saw was disgusting
and criminal,

20:56.418 --> 20:58.086
but it had
nothing to do with drugs.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.154
Uh...

21:02.391 --> 21:03.491
She was filming

21:03.526 --> 21:07.328
cruise-shipworkers illegally
dumping trash out at sea.

21:07.363 --> 21:10.365
So that's why she was on the
operations deck of the ship.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.167
She was making
a documentary film.

21:12.201 --> 21:14.335
Poor thing was trying to be
a one-woman Greenpeace.

21:14.370 --> 21:16.771
But she must have stumbled on
a drug-smuggling conspiracy

21:16.806 --> 21:19.007
moving heroin through
the cruise line's trash.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.141
That's brilliant!

21:20.176 --> 21:22.710
Nobody looks into the trash
moving in and out of ports.

21:22.745 --> 21:24.879
So all we got to do now
is trace the pipeline

21:24.914 --> 21:27.161
back to our mystery man
inside the CIA.

21:27.504 --> 21:30.752
Okay, start by finding
the trash-management company

21:30.786 --> 21:33.087
contracted
with Iconic Cruise Lines.

21:33.122 --> 21:34.589
Clearly, they're a part of this.

21:34.623 --> 21:35.690
In the meantime,

21:35.724 --> 21:38.426
I'm gonna try to figure out
who Acosta's working for.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.861
[Knock on door]

21:39.895 --> 21:41.029
Captain Beckett,

21:41.063 --> 21:43.364
Salvador Acosta's public
defender wants to have a word.

21:43.399 --> 21:44.799
Uh, sure. Yeah, come on in.

21:45.668 --> 21:48.369
Hi, Captain Beckett.
Caleb Brown.

21:48.404 --> 21:49.571
Hi. Please sit down.

21:49.605 --> 21:51.439
I'm gonna go
work on the old core.

21:51.473 --> 21:53.074
Okay.

21:53.108 --> 21:56.744
So, against my advice,
Mr. Acosta wants to make a deal.

21:56.779 --> 21:58.446
He'll cop
to second-degree murder

21:58.480 --> 22:01.616
if <i>you</i> will recommend
a reduced sentence.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.418
Second-degree murder, really?

22:03.452 --> 22:05.253
Um...

22:05.287 --> 22:06.754
He's gonna have to give us
something for that.

22:06.789 --> 22:09.057
Okay, like what?

22:09.091 --> 22:12.293
Like who he's working for
and where the heroin came from.

22:12.328 --> 22:14.395
[Exhales sharply]

22:14.430 --> 22:16.965
What... what heroin?

22:16.999 --> 22:20.101
Counselor, we have
video footage of your client

22:20.135 --> 22:22.971
smuggling kilos of uncut heroin.

22:23.005 --> 22:25.473
Captain, my client insists

22:25.507 --> 22:28.409
that those were merely
bags of spoiled flour,

22:28.444 --> 22:31.479
so unless you can
produce any physical evidence,

22:31.513 --> 22:34.282
you don't really
have a case, so...

22:36.785 --> 22:38.353
Okay, okay.

22:38.387 --> 22:39.654
Second-degree murder,

22:39.688 --> 22:43.358
no recommendation
for a reduced sentence.

22:43.392 --> 22:45.593
Take the win, captain.

22:45.628 --> 22:49.497
Take it, 'cause we don't...
We don't want to go to trial.

22:49.531 --> 22:51.666
Esposito: Ha, let me guess
he offered you a deal?

22:51.700 --> 22:54.636
Yeah. I told him
I had to think about it.

22:54.670 --> 22:56.938
Well, there's no way
Acosta was acting alone.

22:56.972 --> 22:58.506
No way a cartel would
leave a guy like that

22:58.540 --> 22:59.941
in charge
of that much inventory.

22:59.975 --> 23:02.377
Now we finally
have the evidence to prove it.

23:02.411 --> 23:04.445
CSU finally analyzed
that blood residue

23:04.480 --> 23:06.481
from the photograph you took at
the crime scene... check it out.

23:06.515 --> 23:09.183
There's two different kinds of
footprints next to Castle's shoe.

23:09.218 --> 23:11.452
Acosta <i>definitely</i> had a partner
aboard that ship.

23:11.487 --> 23:14.188
We need to find something solid
to make Acosta roll.

23:14.223 --> 23:16.124
You know,
I have his cell records.

23:16.158 --> 23:18.660
There was a flurry
of phone calls to a burner cell

23:18.694 --> 23:20.028
right before the murder.

23:20.062 --> 23:21.496
Acosta could have been coordinating

23:21.530 --> 23:22.430
with his partner
on board the ship.

23:22.464 --> 23:24.299
I'll get in touch
with the cell provider,

23:24.333 --> 23:26.334
see if we can ping that burner
phone so we can locate it.

23:26.368 --> 23:27.802
And take apart Acosta's life.

23:27.836 --> 23:29.337
Let's check known associates...

23:29.371 --> 23:32.073
Anything that will point us
to who his partner was.

23:32.107 --> 23:34.809
I found out who sent Kate
that mystery text last night.

23:34.843 --> 23:36.811
It was Vikram.

23:36.845 --> 23:38.913
Wait, Vikram? <i>Our</i> Vikram?

23:38.948 --> 23:41.049
Oh, yes.

23:41.083 --> 23:41.849
Well, what's this?

23:41.884 --> 23:44.052
Oh, it's
a secret messaging program

23:44.086 --> 23:46.354
between Kate
and Vikram's cellphones.

23:46.388 --> 23:47.822
It routes through proxy servers

23:47.856 --> 23:49.490
into an encrypted
central server...

23:49.525 --> 23:51.492
State-of-the-art spycraft.

23:51.527 --> 23:53.661
But why? What are they up to?

23:53.696 --> 23:56.998
Martha: I could ask the
same thing of the two of you.

23:57.032 --> 23:58.399
Richard, what's going on?

23:58.434 --> 23:59.534
Nothing.

24:00.803 --> 24:04.505
I told you, if you can't tell
your mother what you're doing,

24:04.540 --> 24:06.107
you should not be doing it.

24:06.141 --> 24:08.343
Yes, when I was 8.

24:08.377 --> 24:09.444
Well, exactly.

24:09.478 --> 24:11.212
And you should know better
by now.

24:11.246 --> 24:12.547
My wife is in trouble.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.382
I <i>have</i> to know what's going on.

24:14.416 --> 24:16.617
I have to help her.
I have to protect her.

24:16.652 --> 24:18.219
No, you have to <i>trust</i> her.

24:18.253 --> 24:20.021
But it's finally
starting to make sense.

24:20.055 --> 24:21.022
Don't you see, mother?

24:21.056 --> 24:22.190
Beckett broke up with me

24:22.224 --> 24:25.126
right after Allison Hyde's death.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.428
That's also
when she partnered with Vikram.

24:27.463 --> 24:28.863
So we have to ask ourselves,

24:28.897 --> 24:30.865
what if Allison Hyde
didn't kill herself?

24:30.899 --> 24:32.567
What if she was murdered?

24:32.601 --> 24:33.568
Yes.

24:33.602 --> 24:36.371
By the same people
who murdered Senator Bracken

24:36.405 --> 24:38.473
<i>and</i> Beckett's former team at the A.G.

24:38.507 --> 24:40.875
And of course Vikram used
to work at the A.G.'s office.

24:40.909 --> 24:42.210
What if Kate brought him in

24:42.244 --> 24:44.445
to secretly help her
investigate those murders?

24:44.480 --> 24:45.813
Can you hack Vikram's firewall?

24:45.848 --> 24:47.582
Sure. It'll take a while.

Richard...

24:48.517 --> 24:49.617
[Sighs]

24:49.651 --> 24:53.287
Look, regardless of what
Katherine is doing and why,

24:53.322 --> 24:55.723
are you sure
that you want to do this?

24:55.758 --> 24:58.659
Because if she finds out
that you are spying,

24:58.694 --> 25:03.164
you may just have crossed a line
you cannot uncross.

25:03.198 --> 25:04.899
She may just get herself killed.

25:04.933 --> 25:06.501
She's left me no other choice.

25:06.535 --> 25:08.269
There's always another choice.

25:08.303 --> 25:11.906
So, what's it gonna be, Rick?

25:11.940 --> 25:15.676
I have to know.
No matter the consequence.

25:15.711 --> 25:17.178

25:20.441 --> 25:22.308
that Acosta called
the night of the murder?

25:22.343 --> 25:23.710
It just pinged off a cell tower

25:23.744 --> 25:25.498
at 125th and Lex in east Harlem.

25:25.577 --> 25:26.989
Acosta's partner is in the city.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.114
Now, how to find him?

25:28.148 --> 25:30.082
He could be anywhere
within a couple-mile radius

25:30.117 --> 25:30.917
from that cell tower.

25:30.951 --> 25:32.051
We need to dig into
Acosta's life,

25:32.085 --> 25:34.387
see if he had any connections
to that part of town.

25:34.421 --> 25:35.988
I'll give Beckett the heads-up.

must have cut a deal with Loksat

through the cruise line.

- Check this out.

but only two showed up
at the dump at 9:17.

27:37.344 --> 27:40.446
So the third one must
have been carrying the heroin,

and then it stopped
after it made the delivery.

- Castle: What?

28:19.486 --> 28:20.386
They're onto us.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.454
Vikram's trying to track our I.P. address.

28:22.489 --> 28:23.322
Can you stop him?

28:23.356 --> 28:24.356
No.

28:24.391 --> 28:26.458
But I can slow him down.

28:26.493 --> 28:28.127
It's coming from inside the city.

28:28.161 --> 28:29.461
Trying to narrow it down.

28:29.496 --> 28:30.462
Okay.

Oh, you are good,
but I am better.

28:56.823 --> 28:59.525

That doesn't seem like Loksat.

28:59.559 --> 29:01.126
Who would do that?

29:01.161 --> 29:02.461
We're about to find out.

29:02.495 --> 29:03.595
That barely slowed him down.

29:03.630 --> 29:05.331
I'm sorry, but he's gonna
find us in less than a minute.

29:05.365 --> 29:06.398
Should we abort?

29:06.433 --> 29:08.500
No. We... we've only got
two of the blinky boxes

29:08.535 --> 29:09.234
left to go.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.337
- Blinky boxes?
- Just hack, hack.

29:12.772 --> 29:13.906
Vikram: Come on.

29:13.940 --> 29:15.007
Got it.

29:15.041 --> 29:18.377
[Beeping]

29:18.411 --> 29:20.212
That's Castle's office.

29:20.246 --> 29:21.680
He must be working with Hayley.

29:21.715 --> 29:22.802
She's got the skill set for this,

29:22.855 --> 29:24.860
and she is about to
breach our firewall.

29:24.926 --> 29:27.219
If she does,
they'll have instant access

29:27.253 --> 29:28.420
to our entire investigation.

29:28.455 --> 29:30.489
No, no, no, no, that's gonna put
a target on Castle's back.

29:30.523 --> 29:31.557
We have to stop him.

29:31.591 --> 29:33.120
I can do it, but I need time.

Let me see
if I can buy you some.

It's Beckett calling.

29:38.064 --> 29:39.932
That's Beckett. She's calling.
What do I do?

Answer it.
Let's see how much she knows.

29:45.905 --> 29:47.406
tonight's still not gonna work.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.707
But what about right now?

29:48.742 --> 29:50.409

29:50.443 --> 29:54.680
My office? That sounds <i>great.</i>

29:54.714 --> 29:57.216
I'm, uh...

29:57.250 --> 29:59.184

of something right now.

29:59.219 --> 30:01.754

'cause I'm right downstairs.

30:04.057 --> 30:06.225
Yeah. I can be up in 10 seconds.

10 seconds is not long at all.

one second.

30:10.463 --> 30:11.296

No. She's lying.

Her phone is pinging
from queens.

30:43.864 --> 30:45.297
[Sighs] She's almost in.

30:45.332 --> 30:46.165
I could launch a cyber nuke,

30:46.199 --> 30:48.334
but it will completely fry
his system.

30:50.704 --> 30:52.371
He's got a back-up system
at home.

30:52.405 --> 30:54.773
Is that a go for launch?

30:54.808 --> 30:56.609
Yes.

the whole system.

I never liked that guy.

Did they get in?

31:15.228 --> 31:17.897
No. Another second
and they would have.

31:17.931 --> 31:20.699
Thankfully, our location and
all our files are still safe.

31:20.734 --> 31:22.301
Yeah, for now.

I didn't nuke my marriage.

No, that'll have to wait.

31:33.111 --> 31:35.412
I found the garbage-truck driver
from friendly islands.

all over the news,

31:40.051 --> 31:41.084
No, I hate lying to him.

31:41.119 --> 31:43.620
I know, but you're doing it
for the right reasons.

This is our first real shot
to get to Loksat.

You're right.

31:50.561 --> 31:52.596

Tell me about the driver.

31:52.630 --> 31:54.829
His name is Sam Mackey.

Wait, wait! Wait!

32:06.844 --> 32:08.912
Please don't hurt me!
Please! Who are you?

32:08.946 --> 32:10.981
We're the people that show
when you screw up a delivery.

32:11.015 --> 32:13.150
No, I took it straight to the
warehouse, just like I was told.

32:13.184 --> 32:14.151
Don't lie to us.
We were watching.

32:14.185 --> 32:15.952
- You didn't follow instructions.
- Yes, I did.

32:15.987 --> 32:17.321
I went straight to the place
in the Bronx

32:17.355 --> 32:18.188
by the 3rd Avenue bridge,

32:18.222 --> 32:20.624
just like the guy
from Panama said!

32:20.658 --> 32:21.958
Did you see anything?

32:21.993 --> 32:22.859
No.

32:22.894 --> 32:25.478
I stayed in the truck
like I was told.

32:27.598 --> 32:29.166
Who's the guy in Panama?

32:29.200 --> 32:30.600
I don't know.

32:30.635 --> 32:31.768
I know what you're thinking,
Sam.

32:31.803 --> 32:35.105
You're thinking I'm not gonna
kill you, and you are right.

32:35.139 --> 32:36.673
But you've been running drugs,

32:36.708 --> 32:40.344
and that means the NYPD can
seize everything in your life.

32:40.378 --> 32:42.312
Want your kids to live
out of a cardboard box?

32:42.347 --> 32:43.747
'Cause that's
what's gonna happen.

32:43.781 --> 32:45.182
I don't know any names.

They pay me
<i>not</i> to ask questions.

I-I...

32:49.487 --> 32:50.620

32:50.655 --> 32:52.356
I think he's telling the truth.

32:52.390 --> 32:54.157
All right, Sam,
here's what's gonna happen.

32:54.192 --> 32:55.659
I'm not gonna arrest you,

32:55.693 --> 32:58.295
but if you get another delivery,
you call this number.

32:58.329 --> 33:00.464
No, no, no, no.
I can't. They'll kill me.

33:00.498 --> 33:01.398
They might.

33:01.432 --> 33:03.700
But if I arrest you,
they definitely will.

33:03.735 --> 33:05.702
And telling them
about this conversation

33:05.737 --> 33:08.105
guarantees that your
whole family will be wiped out.

33:08.139 --> 33:09.940
I won't say a word. I promise.

33:09.974 --> 33:14.344
Good. Now, where exactly is
the warehouse full of heroin?

33:17.081 --> 33:19.049
Beckett: [Sighs]

33:19.083 --> 33:20.851
We're too late.
They already moved the heroin.

33:20.885 --> 33:21.685
And there's no street cams outside

33:21.719 --> 33:23.220
so we could see
who picked it up.

33:23.254 --> 33:25.889
Damn it. This was for nothing.

33:25.923 --> 33:28.225
No, no, we do have something.

who the main players are

33:29.894 --> 33:30.794
at Friendly Islands Sanitation,

33:30.828 --> 33:32.863
and the next time Sam
catches a shipment,

33:32.897 --> 33:33.597
we'll... We'll be there.

33:33.631 --> 33:35.165
[Cellphone rings] It's Ryan.

I-I'll be right there.

Acosta's partner.

33:44.516 --> 33:47.043
Cellphone belonging to
Acosta's mystery partner

33:47.078 --> 33:48.979
was used in east Harlem
earlier today.

33:49.013 --> 33:51.648
We tore apart Acosta's life.

33:51.682 --> 33:54.351
He used to crash at an apartment
in that neighborhood.

33:54.385 --> 33:56.653
The name on the lease
was a Leo Longarzo.

33:56.687 --> 33:57.888
Leo is a traveling salesman

33:57.922 --> 34:00.190
for an Ecuadorian
import/export company.

34:00.224 --> 34:02.192
Well, that sounds like code
for a cartel lieutenant.

34:02.226 --> 34:04.861
Right. He travels all over
the world, no wife, no kids.

34:04.896 --> 34:05.862
It gets better.

34:05.897 --> 34:07.764
We checked the passenger
manifest of the cruise.

34:07.799 --> 34:08.732
Longarzo was on that ship.

to sit on his apartment.

You know, when I hung up
my shingle as a P.I.,

34:29.821 --> 34:31.788
I knew I would have to
follow some wives.

34:31.822 --> 34:35.225
I just never thought
it would be my own.

34:35.260 --> 34:38.996
Castle, why couldn't you
just trust me?

34:39.351 --> 34:42.166
How can you ask me that?

34:42.426 --> 34:44.467
I saw the text Vikram sent you
last night.

34:44.502 --> 34:46.570
I thought you were in trouble.

34:46.603 --> 34:49.317
Instead, I find out
you've been lying to me.

34:51.283 --> 34:52.976
I was trying to protect you.

34:53.011 --> 34:55.612
From Allison Hyde's killer?

34:55.647 --> 34:57.014
Yeah, it was easy to figure out
once I realized

34:57.047 --> 35:00.117
you weren't just
looking for "me" time.

35:00.464 --> 35:04.821
Loksat thinks
that his cover-up worked.

35:05.055 --> 35:07.024
That's why he let us live.

35:07.298 --> 35:09.593
And if he finds out
that I am still pursuing this,

35:09.627 --> 35:11.762
he will kill me
and anyone that I am close to.

35:11.796 --> 35:15.632

I had to push you away.

35:17.402 --> 35:22.372

think that breaks my heart.

I'd walk into a tornado
for you, Kate.

35:23.841 --> 35:26.643
And I would die if I lost you.

35:26.678 --> 35:29.479
You want to know
what hurts the most?

35:29.514 --> 35:32.883
You could have come to me
with everything,

35:32.917 --> 35:34.551
broken us up just like you did,

35:34.586 --> 35:36.520
only it would have been a cover.

35:36.554 --> 35:40.390
And together, in secret, we
could have taken this guy down.

35:40.425 --> 35:42.726
Only that thought never
even occurred to you,

35:42.760 --> 35:46.230
because deep down inside,
you like being broken,

35:46.264 --> 35:48.665
and you need this obsession.

35:48.700 --> 35:51.635
And no matter what I do,
I can't change that.

No, actually, I was just leaving.

Wait, no, Castle.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.453
- Anybody with him?
- No, he's alone.

And there's no one else
in the apartment

36:33.792 --> 36:34.636
as far as I can tell.

36:34.675 --> 36:37.314
All right, we'll take it
from here. Thank you.

36:37.432 --> 36:39.027
If this guy really is cartel,

36:39.061 --> 36:40.928
he might have an arsenal
up in that apartment.

36:40.963 --> 36:42.558
Should we call ESU?

brought us closer to Loksat.

Instead, he's in the morgue.

37:37.352 --> 37:39.787

crashing down around my ears,

Ah, you are having a pity party.

37:43.959 --> 37:44.992
That's okay. I'll leave.

37:45.027 --> 37:49.297
But I will be taking
a pretty juicy clue with me.

37:49.331 --> 37:51.399
If you're messing with me,
I might shoot you.

37:51.433 --> 37:53.101
Does that mean
you want to hear what I got?

37:53.135 --> 37:54.569
Yeah.

37:54.603 --> 37:56.804
Okay. Okay.

I was able to trace the
ownership of the warehouse

where Sam Mackey
dropped off the heroin.

38:00.676 --> 38:01.743
It's a Cayman's shell corp.

38:01.777 --> 38:04.946
I dug back into the articles
of incorporation from '99.

38:04.980 --> 38:09.013
You won't believe
who wrote up those documents.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.585
Caleb Brown.

38:11.018 --> 38:13.588
Acosta's public defender?

38:13.622 --> 38:16.190
Turns out Brown worked for
a major corporate law firm

38:16.225 --> 38:17.024
back in the day.

38:17.059 --> 38:19.026
Pulled in mid-six figures annually.

38:19.061 --> 38:21.329
Then he suddenly gave it up
a few years ago

38:21.363 --> 38:23.264
to be a defender of the people.

38:23.298 --> 38:24.665
That's the perfect cover.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.968
It gives Brown access
to assets in prison

38:27.002 --> 38:28.603
and allows him to pass orders

38:28.637 --> 38:30.638
to dealers
that we've already caught.

38:30.672 --> 38:32.507
Dealers like Acosta.

38:32.541 --> 38:35.476
Brown told Acosta to take
the fall for Lara's murder

38:35.511 --> 38:37.879
so that we would back off
of the drugs.

38:37.913 --> 38:40.481
And Acosta obliged.
That's how powerful Brown is.

38:40.516 --> 38:42.049
Okay, we can't go
straight at this guy.

38:42.084 --> 38:44.652
He's not a scared truck driver.
This guy is a shark.

38:44.686 --> 38:47.902
And if he sees us coming,
Loksat's gonna burn all of us.

38:48.219 --> 38:51.192
We've got to track Brown's
every move nice and quiet.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.228
It's gonna take time.

38:54.263 --> 38:56.252
Yeah, but if we do it right...

38:58.613 --> 39:01.702
He'll lead us straight to Loksat.

39:21.390 --> 39:23.191
<i>Lucy: I thought you said
lying was wrong.</i>

39:23.225 --> 39:25.983
I did. It is, but...

39:26.485 --> 39:28.727
She thought
she was protecting me.

39:28.780 --> 39:32.672
<i>Okay, so does that mean
you could forgive her?</i>

39:32.791 --> 39:35.503
I don't know. Maybe.

39:35.537 --> 39:37.738
<i>Yeah, don't take this
the wrong way, Rick,</i>

39:37.773 --> 39:39.607
<i>but you don't make any sense.</i>

39:39.641 --> 39:42.118
Well, that's because
I'm in love.

39:42.501 --> 39:45.947
But you wouldn't understand that.

39:45.981 --> 39:48.248
<i>So why are you talking to me about it?</i>

39:48.353 --> 39:49.567
Touche.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.152
[Knock on door]

39:56.225 --> 39:58.393
You were right.

39:58.427 --> 39:59.861
Okay.

39:59.895 --> 40:02.997
Everything that you said,
you were absolutely right.

40:03.032 --> 40:04.866
Could you be more specific?

40:04.900 --> 40:07.769
That our break-up
could have just been a cover

40:07.803 --> 40:10.838
so that we could bring down
Loksat together.

40:10.873 --> 40:12.040
Yeah.

40:12.074 --> 40:13.775
I wish you would have
come to me.

40:13.809 --> 40:15.910
Well, I'm here now...

40:15.944 --> 40:17.573
So let's do it.

40:18.826 --> 40:21.049
It's not that easy.

40:21.083 --> 40:23.451
I thought that you would...

40:23.485 --> 40:26.320
Just take you back, in spite
of what you put me through?

40:28.684 --> 40:32.760
Look, Castle, I am sorry.
I hate that I hurt you.

40:32.795 --> 40:34.699
That was never what I wanted.

40:35.898 --> 40:38.900
But you did hurt me, Kate,
and what's worse...

40:38.934 --> 40:41.769
- You lost faith in me.
- No, I never...

40:41.804 --> 40:43.438
I <i>need</i> you, Rick.

40:43.472 --> 40:45.940
I didn't realize
even how much I needed you

40:45.974 --> 40:48.270
until this happened.

40:48.732 --> 40:53.064
Please, just don't make me
do this without you.

40:58.776 --> 40:59.887
Okay.

41:11.522 --> 41:14.769
Though you do realize

41:14.803 --> 41:17.772
I'm gonna have to punish you
a little first.

41:17.806 --> 41:19.574
Naked punishing?

41:19.608 --> 41:22.143
<i>Very</i> naked punish.

41:31.331 --> 41:33.218
<i>Aw, you guys.</i>
