00:00.401 --> 00:02.935
 Liv: <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:02.937 --> 00:04.636
     Ravi, you did it!
     You made a zombie rat!

00:04.638 --> 00:06.705
      (screaming in pain)

00:08.509 --> 00:11.076
   -You guys seen my friend?
   -Brother, i just saw him.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.411
       We'll have you
       to him in no time.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.146
      No word from jerome?

00:14.148 --> 00:15.514
   -Liv: How did this happen?
   -(gasps)

00:15.516 --> 00:16.648
      He got into a fight.

00:16.650 --> 00:17.750
   I went looking for jerome.

00:17.752 --> 00:19.318
         And found
         the candyman.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.688
      Major: <i> I saw something</i>
     <i> in the candyman's car.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:24.923
     <i> There was an ice chest</i>
     <i> in the passenger seat.</i>

00:24.925 --> 00:26.658
     It had a brain inside.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.394
      Liv: <i> I'm heading over</i>
     <i> to lowell's place.</i>

00:28.396 --> 00:29.561
      Liv: <i> How do you eat?</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:31.330
    Lowell: <i> A funeral home.</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:33.665
  Lowell: <i> For the right price,</i>
  <i> a mortician will</i>
  <i> look the other way.</i>

00:36.237 --> 00:37.302
             Drop!

00:37.304 --> 00:38.370
          Settle down.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.506
           (exhales)

00:46.714 --> 00:48.047
     (elevator bell dings)

01:10.604 --> 01:12.571
Liv: <i> I had one chance at love.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:14.239
       <i> Turns out my</i>
       <i> would-be soul mate</i>

01:14.241 --> 01:16.508
     <i> Survives on the brains</i>
     <i> of murdered teenagers.</i>

01:16.510 --> 01:18.710
   Man: You can't park here.

01:18.712 --> 01:21.547
  It's a loading zone.
  Management will have my ass.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.616
      Five minutes.
      You think your boss
      is unreasonable?

01:27.188 --> 01:28.854
     Get comfortable, kid.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.123
            (grunts)
            ugh.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.762
     Say goodnight, gracie.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.263
            (gasps)

01:38.933 --> 01:39.998
           Your car?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.400
           (whistles)
           gone.

01:43.404 --> 01:47.873
   This intimidation routine
   you've got down here must
     usually work wonders.

01:49.343 --> 01:52.911
  Thing is, i'm bigger.
  And i'm not going anywhere.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.182
      (theme song playing)

02:21.041 --> 02:24.309
   Twelve hours after being
   bitten by the zombie rat.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.146
   Vital signs remain normal.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.350
        No marked change
        in appearance.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.318
       Continuing to
       monitor progress.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.623
           Liv! Uh...

02:37.625 --> 02:40.893
      You're not due
      to start your shift
      for another hour.

02:40.895 --> 02:43.095
      I was just about to
      start reconstituting

02:43.097 --> 02:44.796
 Mrs. Bushnell's chest cavity.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.837
           You okay?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.572
     He asked rhetorically.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.542
   Blaine murders teenagers
   and delivers their brains
          to zombies.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.709
           Good lord.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.179
      And my boyfriend
      is on his meal plan.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.447
     I ate some of lowell's
     leftover breakfast
     this morning,

03:02.449 --> 03:06.418
  And it was jerome,
  that kid who came in here
  a few weeks ago with major.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.120
  I watched blaine murder him.

03:08.122 --> 03:10.756
    But the police
    found his remains
    at the shepherds' house.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.724
       I saw what i saw.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.493
    And as i was
    leaving lowell's place,

03:14.495 --> 03:17.029
  Blaine was heading up
  with a new delivery.
  I should've done something.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.564
      What could you have
      possibly done?

03:18.566 --> 03:19.731
         I'm a zombie.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.933
         He's a zombie.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.901
   And a cold-blooded killer.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.803
        We need a plan.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.506
 And all those missing persons?
 They're part of a zombie
 meals on wheels program.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.809
  If jerome didn't die out in
  the shepherds' cabin...

03:30.811 --> 03:33.145
    How did the police find
    his remains out there?

03:33.147 --> 03:35.814
 Something's rotten in denmark.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.417
 Denmark, in this case, being
 the seattle police department.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.652
     Well, it's settled.
     I have to find blaine.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.388
 Well, you do know
 one person who can reach him.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.258
    Lowell? No, i won't even
    be able to look at him.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.493
    He has to know where
    those brains come from.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.028
  Do you have another option?

03:50.798 --> 03:52.331
              No.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.367
     So major was right
     this whole time
     about the candyman and

03:55.369 --> 03:57.803
      Those missing kids.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.338
       I made him promise
       he'd back off,

03:59.340 --> 04:01.406
  I convinced him
  he was getting carried away.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.976
   Well, if it makes you
   feel better, i don't think
   he listened to you.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.744
    He remains single-minded
    in his quest.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.713
     Look in on him for me,
     will you?

04:07.715 --> 04:09.414
     I'm worried about him.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.882
     Well, he's hardly
     left his room lately.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.384
   Who knows
   what's going on in there.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.721
           (gunshot)

04:17.524 --> 04:20.125
       <i> One in the head.</i>
       <i> One in the heart.</i>

04:20.127 --> 04:23.895
  <i> -But before we master</i>
  <i> the fine art of targeting...</i>
  -(gun cocking)

04:23.897 --> 04:25.297
     Ravi: Major, you home?

04:25.299 --> 04:27.432
    <i> -...We're going to start</i>
    <i> with the basics.</i>
    -Major: In here!

04:31.405 --> 04:32.571
            Come in!

04:35.676 --> 04:39.077
   Oh, it has been too long,
   my friend.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.147
  There are souls
  that need reaping.
  Dungeons that need looting.

04:42.149 --> 04:45.117
  Wenches that need to feel
  the weathered hands of a...

04:45.119 --> 04:46.351
         What the hell?

04:50.090 --> 04:53.091
 "brains: The final frontier"?

04:53.093 --> 04:55.260
   This body building blog
   says there's an amino acid

04:55.262 --> 04:57.663
  That skyrockets the release
  of growth hormones.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.399
 Now, you can get it
 from the extract of the roots
 of this african plant

05:00.401 --> 05:02.367
     I seriously
     can't even pronounce,

05:02.369 --> 05:05.170
   But the purest source
   is human pituitary glands.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.638
     Aren't you big enough?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.707
 No, i'm just looking
 for any reason that guy julien

05:08.709 --> 05:10.208
     Might have had a brain
     in his ice chest.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.011
      And this makes
      about as much sense
      as anything else.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.781
       I suppose it does.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.317
  Now, who wants
  to go slay some
  dark creatures of the night

05:18.319 --> 05:20.552
    And make the
    world a safer place for
    all of mankind?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.455
        It is my quest,

05:23.457 --> 05:25.357
       And i will not
       shrink before it.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.068
              Hey!

05:36.070 --> 05:37.302
        We need to talk.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.373
      (paintballs thudding
      and splattering)

05:41.375 --> 05:42.841
       Teen team leader:
       Harris, caleb,

05:42.843 --> 05:44.943
     On my mark,
     jump out and lay down
     suppressing fire.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.079
    John, phil, you guys
    flank them on the right.

05:47.081 --> 05:49.815
     Drew, you're with me
     flanking left. Got it?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.416
           Let's go.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.385
    (paintball guns firing)

06:00.094 --> 06:01.426
           Cover me.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.668
      (paintball gunshot)

06:10.838 --> 06:12.504
 Yo, you gotta clear the field.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.174
   Hey, yo, man. I shot you.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.477
 You gotta go to the dead zone.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.915
          (screaming)

06:31.291 --> 06:32.391
    Where can i find blaine?

06:32.393 --> 06:33.825
    Wait. I don't understand
    what you're saying.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.827
 The brains i eat,
 they come from funeral homes.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.963
      I saw blaine deliver
      that cooler to you
      this morning.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.365
   -And that's where he says
   he gets his brains.
   -Well, he's a liar!

06:40.367 --> 06:42.601
    And you told me
    you got your own brains.
    So you're both liars.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.737
  The two of you are liable to
  give zombies a bad name.
  Where can i find him?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.839
       Slow down, please.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.608
      What makes you think
      he's killing people?

06:49.610 --> 06:52.611
   I had a bite of your eggs
   and brains on my way out
      and i had a vision.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.647
 I saw blaine slaughter the boy
 whose brain we ate.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.383
  I met him, lowell!
  He seemed like a great kid.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.453
   The question is how can
   you claim not to know
   blaine is killing people?

07:01.455 --> 07:04.790
       You're a zombie.
       You have visions.

07:04.792 --> 07:08.026
   You ever stop to wonder
   why all the people you eat
   are so young?

07:08.028 --> 07:10.195
 Why they all came to
 such tragic and violent ends?

07:10.197 --> 07:13.198
    They weren't all young.
    A lot were, but not all.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.367
   And i've only had
   a couple violent visions.

07:15.369 --> 07:17.068
       I don't go looking
       for triggers.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.504
  I don't investigate murders.
  It's not like i saw blaine
  kill anyone.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.973
    When you need another
    delivery, how do you get
    in touch with blaine?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.442
       When blaine
       made me a zombie,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.744
       He told me he'd
       get me the brains
       i needed to live.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.213
    I was starving.
    I didn't have a choice.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.148
    There's always a choice!

07:30.150 --> 07:32.984
  And right now,
  you could choose to tell me
  how to locate blaine.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.754
    That's the only reason
    you're here?
    To get that information?

07:35.756 --> 07:38.990
  You can't slow down for
  a moment and talk about us?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.525
              Us?

07:40.527 --> 07:44.296
    There is no us.
    There's me and this guy
    who i don't recognize

07:44.298 --> 07:46.698
    Who eats the brains of
    murdered homeless kids.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.034
       You're damn right
       i only came
       for that number!

07:49.036 --> 07:51.403
  Say you call him, then what?

07:51.405 --> 07:52.571
      I'll figure it out.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.805
    No. No. Not good enough.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.373
         What does it
         matter to you
         now, anyway?

07:55.375 --> 07:57.476
     Well, for a start,
     i'm in love with you.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.147
       (phone vibrating)

08:06.787 --> 08:08.386
       Well, that's gonna
       be a problem.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.834
      (makes wolf whistle)

08:22.836 --> 08:24.035
        Hot date, boss?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.270
            Better.

08:25.272 --> 08:29.207
 Sex i can get whenever i want.
 This, though...

08:29.209 --> 08:31.643
 Ticket to the emp to hear
 kurt cobain's unreleased demos

08:31.645 --> 08:33.544
       Before anyone else
       in the world?

08:33.547 --> 08:34.645
       That's priceless.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.916
   Nirvana was the soundtrack
   of my youth.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.019
     Hell, my childhood
     ended april 5th, 1994.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.823
   I'm 13, headed to algebra.

08:44.825 --> 08:48.093
   Alyssa delbarre
   comes running up and says
   "he's dead! He's dead!"

08:49.129 --> 08:50.829
        Starts bawling
        on my shoulder.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.734
      Then you nailed her?
      (chuckles) nice.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.470
           (sighing)

08:58.472 --> 09:00.605
     Lawrence kaiser called
     a little while ago.

09:00.607 --> 09:01.706
             Dibs!

09:01.708 --> 09:03.308
   No, julien
   will handle the delivery.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.709
          Aw, come on.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.511
  You do not purge your bowels
  in the powder room of a man

09:06.513 --> 09:08.213
     With a helicopter pad
     in his backyard.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.348
        You squealed?
        Bitch move, man!

09:10.350 --> 09:11.950
        Enough. Enough.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.287
     Kaiser wasn't looking
     for product.

09:15.289 --> 09:17.689
      He wants to
      have lunch thursday.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.025
          At his club.

09:20.027 --> 09:22.694
    He wants to talk about
    a business opportunity.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.462
 Says he'll send a car for you.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.899
 Well all right, then.
 Everything's coming up blaine.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.735
    Guy's got his own club?

09:31.338 --> 09:33.305
       (clearing throat)

09:34.374 --> 09:35.540
             Uh...

09:36.476 --> 09:38.510
       -Uh-uh.
       -(car door shuts)

09:41.882 --> 09:43.682
           Bad, huh?

09:43.684 --> 09:46.751
 He wouldn't tell me anything.
 I... I really don't want to
 talk about it.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.788
        What about you?
        How's major?

09:49.790 --> 09:54.125
 Uh... Eh, he's still convinced
 that the candyman
 is harvesting human brains.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.895
   Which, you know, i suppose
   is technically true.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.597
        But his working
        theory is that

09:58.599 --> 10:01.066
    It's like a cutting edge
    bodybuilding supplement.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.702
  So, slight silver lining is
  he's not thinking zombie.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.440
  Vic's name is everett adams.
  Twenty-eight.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.508
     Former sniper
     with the army rangers.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.345
    Works at
    this paintball facility
    as an instructor.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.981
  Csi says there's no gunshot
  residue on him,

10:15.983 --> 10:19.150
  So the shot that killed him
  must've been taken
  from a distance.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.518
         You okay, liv?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.620
             Fine.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.855
        All right, then.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.391
  Paintballers were part of
  the big brothers big sisters
  program.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.726
   No one heard the gunshot.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.995
    Unis haven't turned up
    anything that shoots
    real bullets.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.330
  No shell casings near
  the killer's perch, either.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.299
      Excuse me,
      did you say "perch"?

10:34.301 --> 10:37.068
   Yeah. The bullet passed
   through the victim's neck

10:37.070 --> 10:39.004
    And lodged in this log.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.374
  We used its entry point
  to establish its trajectory.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.743
       And there you go.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.381
      So the killer
      was up in that tree?

10:49.383 --> 10:52.183
      That kid over there.
      He's the victim's
      little brother.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.354
  Well, i'll get to work here.
  You two go do your thing.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.456
     (paintball gun firing)

11:04.898 --> 11:06.965
    Harris jenkins?
    I'm detective babineaux,

11:06.967 --> 11:10.168
   And this is
   olivia moore from the
   medical examiner's office.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.103
      We'd like to ask you
      a few questions.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.073
       (continues firing)

11:15.075 --> 11:18.643
    Were you aware of anyone
    who might have wanted to
       do this to everett?

11:18.645 --> 11:19.844
           His wife.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.249
        Ex-wife, i mean.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.719
      She dumps him when
      he's getting shot at
      in afghanistan,

11:27.721 --> 11:30.522
  Then she and the new husband
  try and take away his kid.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.591
   Everett wouldn't let them.

11:37.864 --> 11:38.930
            (fires)

11:41.802 --> 11:44.969
      I'm going to
      bring in the ex-wife
      and her new husband.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.237
      You able to join me?

11:46.239 --> 11:48.640
  I just need to meet the body
  back at the morgue.

11:48.642 --> 11:51.710
   Maybe grab a bite to eat.
   Give me a couple hours?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.079
           All right.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.980
Liv: <i> Sure, i could kid myself,</i>

11:55.982 --> 11:59.451
   <i> Say that i plan to eat</i>
   <i> everett's brain as a way</i>
   <i> of supporting the troops.</i>

11:59.453 --> 12:02.854
   <i> But the truth is,</i>
   <i> i can't handle</i>
   <i> another vision of jerome.</i>

12:07.461 --> 12:11.396
   Penny, this is
   olivia moore with the
   medical examiner's office.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.798
  Sorry for your loss, ma'am.
  Please have a seat.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.871
       Mrs. Taylor,
       we understand that

12:19.873 --> 12:22.874
   You and everett
   were engaged in
   a serious custody battle.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.410
   Right to the point, then.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.747
      Yes, we were
      fighting over anna,

12:28.749 --> 12:30.982
       And it got heated.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.518
    Um. My husband sean
    was offered a promotion,

12:33.520 --> 12:35.754
 But it came with
 a transfer to silicon valley.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.156
    "chief digital officer."

12:38.158 --> 12:40.959
      It came with
      a massive pay raise.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.796
 Penny and i would've been
 able to enroll anna in
 a world-class private school.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.465
   But i had to turn it down.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.267
      When exactly
      did you meet penny?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.370
        (clears throat)

12:52.372 --> 12:56.274
    Yes, i left everett for
    sean while he was
    deployed in afghanistan.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.143
        War changed him.

12:58.145 --> 13:01.312
   He was suffering from ptsd
   but resisted treatment.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.015
    But he left the service.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.718
     He couldn't take
     seeing another man
     raising his daughter.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.654
  Suddenly anna
  was the center of his life.

13:09.656 --> 13:13.091
 How did sean deal with
 everett preventing him
 from accepting this promotion?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.393
          I can't lie.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.995
           It stung.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.696
   But i understood the man.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.166
   I wouldn't let anyone take
   anna away from me, either.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.468
   Might've been nice, had he
   shown the same enthusiasm

13:23.470 --> 13:26.037
   For parenting when he and
   penny were together.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.339
      Where were you
      between the hours of

13:28.341 --> 13:31.476
 4:21 and 4:31 this afternoon,
 mr. Taylor?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.378
      Stuck in a meeting.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.079
         All afternoon.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.215
       A dozen colleagues
       can vouch for me.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.851
          4:20? Um...

13:41.154 --> 13:45.190
    I took anna to the park
    near her school.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.125
      Can anyone
      back you up on that?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.294
   Anna knows where we were.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.262
 She's at home with my sister.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.031
  Anna: <i> You're freaky-looking.</i>

13:53.033 --> 13:54.432
     Why are you so white?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.067
     That's not nice, anna.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.571
  It's okay.
  I work in a basement, anna.
  So i don't see much sun.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.140
      All i need to know
        is what you did
      after school today.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.309
       I was with mommy.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.111
        And what did you
        do with mommy?

14:07.113 --> 14:08.813
    I don't want to do this.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.715
       Tell the nice lady
       where we were.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.484
      Anna: <i> Stop! Please!</i>

14:13.486 --> 14:15.854
    -Stop, daddy! Stop!
    -Everett: You are not
    taking my daughter away!

14:15.856 --> 14:17.755
    -Just stop, daddy! Stop!
    -Everett. Calm...

14:17.757 --> 14:18.857
            (grunts)

14:18.859 --> 14:20.225
     Get out of this house
     right now!

14:20.227 --> 14:21.526
       Get out, get out!

14:26.766 --> 14:28.833
 I don't wanna do this anymore.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.269
        It's okay, baby,
        you did great.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.872
  I think we're through here.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.750
       -So, when you say
       everett snapped...
       -I mean, lost it.

14:45.752 --> 14:48.152
  Like, punching a guy
  in front of a crying child.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.655
  Wild with rage. It was ugly.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.423
    Penny chased him off
    with a butcher's knife.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.259
   Why wouldn't they
   report that to the police?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.461
     Everett being violent
     would've made their
     custody case for them.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.029
            No idea.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.432
      Anna didn't provide
      her mother with the
       most solid alibi.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.235
     I'll see if anyone can
     place penny
     near the crime scene.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.683
          (screaming)

15:19.719 --> 15:21.085
           (panting)

15:21.087 --> 15:22.820
       Liv: <i> Great. Ptsd.</i>

15:22.822 --> 15:26.391
     <i> What's more relaxing</i>
     <i> than a trip down</i>
     <i> traumatic memory lane?</i>

15:29.663 --> 15:32.830
 <i> Exercise may be an</i>
 <i> effective treatment for ptsd,</i>

15:32.832 --> 15:34.732
    <i> But what it really beats</i>
    <i> is laying around,</i>

15:34.734 --> 15:37.168
   <i> Wallowing over the end of</i>
   <i> my posthumous love life.</i>

15:37.170 --> 15:38.269
      (breathing heavily)

15:38.271 --> 15:41.105
    <i> And now i'm overwhelmed</i>
    <i> with desire.</i>

15:41.107 --> 15:44.676
 <i> Called to the battlefield</i>
 <i> and powerless to stop myself.</i>

15:54.087 --> 15:55.887
        "free for all"?

15:55.889 --> 15:57.989
  So, it's last man standing,
  huh?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.159
      (rock music playing)

16:05.732 --> 16:07.498
     (paintball gun firing)

16:10.603 --> 16:12.437
     (paintball gun firing)

16:30.423 --> 16:31.756
       (frustrated groan)

16:53.079 --> 16:55.046
     (paintball gun firing)

16:55.048 --> 16:56.347
          Liv: Hooah!

16:57.851 --> 17:00.985
    This is the tree the cst
    said was the munitions
    point of origin.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.488
  This is where they believed
  the shooter was perched.

17:03.490 --> 17:07.791
   Fifty yards from this tree
   is where everett's body
   was found.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.627
     This is where i found
     the shell casing,

17:09.628 --> 17:12.763
   20 yards closer to everett
   than the cst thought.

17:12.766 --> 17:16.034
  To have shot from there,
  the killer would need to be
  15 feet tall.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.102
   He should be easy to find
   then, shouldn't he?

17:18.104 --> 17:19.237
            Or she.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.638
           Side note,

17:21.641 --> 17:24.909
 That trophy you won in your
 last man standing competition
 is ill-gotten gains.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.078
     I'm guessing you were
     the only participant

17:27.079 --> 17:29.414
 Digesting the brains
 of a highly-decorated soldier.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.884
  If i'm stuck with his ptsd,
  i should at least get
  a trophy out of it.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.852
  You're remembering traumas.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.755
   Do you remember
   anything more of your own?

17:37.757 --> 17:40.925
      After the boat party
      when you woke up
      in a body bag,

17:40.927 --> 17:42.860
       How did you know
       you were a zombie?

17:42.862 --> 17:45.797
      The craving brains
      didn't really speak
         to werewolf.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.199
      -So you immediately
      craved brains?
      -Yeah.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.367
          Immediately.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.035
      I identified myself
      as a doctor

17:51.037 --> 17:53.471
 And refused medical treatment.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.973
 As i was leaving,
 i found a corpse on the shore.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.975
     His skull was already
     cracked open.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.811
    Some other zombie likely
    got the frontal lobe,

17:59.813 --> 18:04.482
  But there was some temporal
  lobe just hanging there
  like fruit on a tree.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.051
     -My first zombie meal.
     -(phone vibrating)

18:10.857 --> 18:12.323
         -(disconnects)
         -(exhales)

18:12.325 --> 18:13.691
     (slams phone on table)

18:14.160 --> 18:16.294
          Can i ask...

18:16.296 --> 18:21.632
 If you hadn't been able
 to get a job with access
 to a pre-killed brain supply,

18:21.634 --> 18:23.968
    What would you have done
    to feed yourself?

18:23.970 --> 18:26.437
     I wouldn't have had
     the brains of murdered
     homeless teens

18:26.439 --> 18:28.005
     Delivered to my house
     like pizza.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.307
      Lowell didn't know.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.808
  Then he didn't want to know.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.245
    But you believe in his
    position you would have?

18:34.247 --> 18:36.981
     I mean...
     What a luxury to not
     have to know for sure.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.150
         Clive: Dr. C,

18:39.152 --> 18:41.919
        Mind if i take
        your assistant
        on a field trip?

18:41.921 --> 18:44.856
 I'd sign her permission slip,
 but my hands are
 covered in viscera.

18:44.858 --> 18:48.392
    Sergeant adams was under
    the care of a shrink
    at the va hospital.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.661
    She advised her patients
    to keep a journal.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.130
  Let's go find that journal.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.765
      (rock music playing)

19:06.179 --> 19:09.080
      Hey, how's it going?
      So, a buddy of mine
      works out here.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.815
  And the dude is just yoked.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.117
   That's where i wanna get,
   and i hear this place
   can make it happen.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.318
      It's your lucky day.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.553
  I happen to have some time.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.688
        I'm looking for
        cutting edge,
        out of the box,

19:17.690 --> 19:20.691
     Whatever it takes,
     no matter how crazy
     it sounds type stuff.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.760
   I think i'm
   just the trainer for you.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.597
  There's no quick fixes here.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.300
   Supplements are a very
   small piece of the puzzle.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.102
     I need to know you're
     ready to do the work.

19:31.104 --> 19:32.870
       I'm ready to work.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.640
 'cause without the work,
 the creatine or nitric oxide's
 not gonna do it.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.611
        Actually, uh...

19:40.613 --> 19:43.214
    I was thinking
    something a little more
    hard core.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.415
             What?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.350
         Arnolds? Tren?

19:46.352 --> 19:50.188
  I saw this blog
  that said if you eat brains,

19:50.190 --> 19:52.857
    The pituitary gland has
    this amino acid in it.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.992
       Makes your
       growth hormones
       go off the chart.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.262
       You mean, brains?

19:59.566 --> 20:00.865
          From people?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.667
      That's what i read.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.068
    And you're up for that?

20:04.070 --> 20:06.404
       Well, like i said,
       i'll do anything.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.740
    You'll eat human brains

20:10.577 --> 20:12.877
     To get bigger muscles?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.745
       I am open to that
       as an option.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.081
      That's good to know.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.258
           Found it.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.329
     I guess everett wasn't
     big on journaling.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.197
     This is all he wrote.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.334
    "one is less than many."

20:36.336 --> 20:38.569
   I think i got that
   in a fortune cookie once.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.605
     It's a sniper mantra.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.707
      Everett's job
      was to kill people.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.743
    That phrase is how he
    kept a clear conscience.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.813
     By killing one person,
     he could save
     a lot more lives.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.682
   Do you know many snipers?

20:53.386 --> 20:54.585
           Just one.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.925
        (metal clanging)

21:08.901 --> 21:10.901
  Harris! What are you doing?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.139
            (gasps)

21:18.278 --> 21:21.712
   Is that a good
   thousand-yard stare or
   a bad thousand-yard stare?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.148
         It's not good.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.025
        Clive: We talked
        to your school.

21:34.027 --> 21:37.094
   The guidance counselor
   had these sketches on file

21:37.096 --> 21:39.930
     That your art teacher
     had handed over.

21:41.567 --> 21:44.602
    According to your
    school records,
    you've had a rough year.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.405
       Anger issues.
       Verbal outbursts.

21:47.407 --> 21:51.042
 At the time everett was shot,
 your paintball team
 had just split up.

21:51.044 --> 21:53.511
     Was there anyone who
     could account for you,

21:53.513 --> 21:55.713
      Just before the body
      was discovered?

21:57.016 --> 21:59.216
    Make no mistake, harris.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.319
       We're gonna catch
       whoever did this.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.189
       Not if i do first.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.930
     He's a messed up kid.

22:12.932 --> 22:16.000
 But losing your mom, brother,
 and male role model in
 the span of a year

22:16.002 --> 22:17.668
      Will do that to you.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.503
      You think he
      pulled the trigger?

22:19.505 --> 22:23.240
  All those drawings?
  He did them before everett
  asked to be his big brother.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.476
    His grades and
    attendance were actually
    on the upswing.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.645
    Got a hit on that search
    you had me run,
    detective.

22:27.647 --> 22:28.713
            Thanks.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.818
  You have time to pay penny
  and sean's neighbor a visit?

22:35.455 --> 22:36.921
        (doorbell rings)

22:36.923 --> 22:40.091
    Penny took a big step up
    the social ladder when
    she married sean.

22:40.093 --> 22:43.994
   From an enlisted soldier's
   quarters to a mini-mansion
        in salish ridge.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.767
    You folks miss the sign?

22:49.769 --> 22:53.104
 I'm detective babineaux and
 this is medical examiner moore
 with the seattle pd.

22:53.106 --> 22:55.306
  You filed a noise complaint
  against your neighbors?

22:56.409 --> 22:58.509
    It's about time someone
    followed up.

22:58.511 --> 23:02.146
    If you don't believe me,
    the noise is only
    the half of it.

23:02.148 --> 23:05.383
   Ever since i filed
   that complaint, it's like
   my place is possessed.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.351
  I've got lights that go on
  in the middle of the night.

23:07.353 --> 23:10.421
  I've got sprinklers that go
  off on the wrong days,
  with me paying the fines.

23:10.423 --> 23:11.922
     You think
     that was the taylors?

23:11.924 --> 23:14.225
    I guess i picked
    the wrong people to take
    to small claims court

23:14.227 --> 23:16.894
     Over my broken mailbox
     and my ruined lawn.

23:16.896 --> 23:20.998
    You know, him working
    with all that high tech
    wizard dweeb stuff.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.969
  But after her ex fishtailed
  out of there and skidded
  across onto my property,

23:24.971 --> 23:26.504
     I hear this commotion.

23:26.506 --> 23:29.440
    I see penny chasing him
    out of the house
    with a butcher knife.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.876
     He slams the gas,
     backs out of there
     like a bat outta hell

23:31.878 --> 23:34.812
   And she's screaming
   at the top of her lungs
   that she's gonna kill him.

23:43.222 --> 23:45.289
   (soft folk music playing)

23:46.125 --> 23:47.858
       (knocking at door)

23:54.100 --> 23:55.833
      I'd like you to go.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.836
   I know you're upset but
   i'm being real clear here.
   You need to leave.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.839
            For you.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.648
      It's michael kenny.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.517
   He was interred yesterday
   at evergreen memorial.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.052
      You dug up a grave?

24:17.023 --> 24:19.857
    I'm sorry.
    I'm sure that was awful.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.426
    It was okay, compared
    to watching the funeral.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.834
   He was an english teacher

24:29.836 --> 24:31.969
  And all these kids he taught
  were there.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.307
 His daughter read his favorite
 shakespeare sonnet.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.743
       His poor wife was
       in hell on earth.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.912
          And i, um...

24:41.914 --> 24:44.181
     I threw up, actually,
     um, because

24:44.183 --> 24:45.950
    I thought about
    all the brains i've had

24:45.952 --> 24:47.718
       And every last
       one of them was...

24:50.523 --> 24:52.656
       I mean, liv, we...
       We eat people.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.494
         We eat people.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.162
            I know.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.897
  And i wanted you to know
  that i get it.

24:59.899 --> 25:03.701
     I was a coward,
     i didn't want to know
     where my...

25:03.703 --> 25:06.971
     I should've tried to,
     er, um...

25:06.973 --> 25:09.206
 Now, blaine killed those kids
 and i ate those brains.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.407
          And i, i...

25:13.212 --> 25:15.279
    I'm sorry. I'm... I'm...

25:17.550 --> 25:18.649
         I'm so sorry.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.252
            (softly)
            i know.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.123
   (soft indie music playing)

25:37.436 --> 25:38.969
       So, this freebie's
       doing the whole,

25:38.971 --> 25:41.906
   "i wanna be big, zoltar,
   i'll do whatever it takes"
   bit.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.341
   C'mon, knock out two more.

25:44.343 --> 25:48.245
    Anyway, i'm thinking he
    wants me to hook him up
    with some juice, right?

25:48.247 --> 25:50.014
         But check it.

25:50.016 --> 25:54.118
   The guy tells me he wants
   to get some human brains.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.853
             Right?

25:55.855 --> 25:57.388
        Total head case.

25:59.659 --> 26:02.860
       You got his info?

26:02.862 --> 26:07.164
  No, i'm serious.
  I think blaine scratched me
  because he's into my music.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.934
    -He keeps asking
    when we're going to jam.
    -(chuckles)

26:09.936 --> 26:13.671
    You never know. He could
    be zombie mccartney to
    your zombie lennon.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.474
        What i know is,
        another year
        on his meal plan

26:17.476 --> 26:19.643
     And my trust fund
     will be zombie tapped.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.779
       How does it work,
       anyway?

26:21.781 --> 26:24.081
      Well, in my case it
      involved a father

26:24.083 --> 26:26.850
    Who had the good fortune
    to inherit a coal mine.

26:26.852 --> 26:29.920
      Not your trust fund.
      Blaine's service.

26:30.756 --> 26:31.822
              Oh.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.597
       They send a menu.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.165
    Changes every few weeks.

26:42.835 --> 26:46.837
    "motor cortex asada,
    basil parietal terrine,

26:46.839 --> 26:48.706
    "cerebellum sashimi..."

26:48.708 --> 26:52.242
 For god's sake,
 cerebellum sashimi is people.

26:52.244 --> 26:56.013
   Hard to overlook,
   no matter what it's called
   or how it's prepared.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.849
       This menu is
       homeless teenagers
       who blaine kills

26:58.851 --> 27:00.584
   In cold blood for profit.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.022
       Blaine has to die.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.960
      I'm gonna kill him.

27:16.702 --> 27:19.837
  Yeah, fantastic. All right.
  Yeah, i'm looking
  forward to it.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.009
         (disconnects)

27:25.011 --> 27:27.578
  Blaine's coming around
  to my place tomorrow night.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.446
            To jam.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.818
      You sure
      you're up for this?

27:34.820 --> 27:36.387
     I'm running on
     elite soldier brains.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.522
   You're the one who has to
   stand next to the guy.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.058
   Well, i could not possibly
   be more terrified,

27:41.060 --> 27:43.527
    But i'm hoping that
    knowing you're watching
    will make me nut up.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.362
       I'm always better
       with an audience.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.868
 I probably shouldn't say this
 to the woman
 i'm in love with but,

27:51.537 --> 27:52.936
         I'm a weenie.

27:52.938 --> 27:55.239
       -(chuckles)
       -i'm one of those
       guitar players who

27:55.241 --> 27:58.275
   Avoids any activity
   that may hurt his fingers.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.778
   I'm not the man who jumps
   in the line of fire.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.315
           But, um...

28:06.986 --> 28:09.253
     That's the kind of man
     you deserve so...

28:10.356 --> 28:11.922
        I'll do my best.

28:13.893 --> 28:17.795
    You're not a weenie.
    You jump out of planes.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.230
    Remember that when
    you're looking through
    the scope of that rifle

28:20.232 --> 28:21.832
     At the puddle of urine
     forming at my feet.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.770
  So, we're really doing this?

28:29.975 --> 28:31.775
      It was transcendent.

28:31.777 --> 28:35.312
  These demos filled in
  gaps about kurt cobain
  i didn't even know existed.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.382
    It showed his musical
    progression from
    fecal matter to nirvana.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.886
   Fecal matter was
   his first band, you guys.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.188
         Fecal matter?

28:44.190 --> 28:46.790
       That's, like, uh,
       poo, right?

28:46.792 --> 28:49.026
   Yes, luta. It's like poo.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.994
    So, uh,
    what's with the get-up?

28:50.996 --> 28:53.097
        My lunch with
        lawrence kaiser
        is today.

28:53.099 --> 28:56.300
  And it's not a "get-up."
  i am a sartorial chameleon.

28:56.302 --> 28:59.136
      Indie rock scene,
      country club.
      I fit in everywhere.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.404
        (phone ringing)

29:02.108 --> 29:04.041
       There's our zombie
       powerbroker now.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.213
       Oh, and julien...

29:09.215 --> 29:12.149
 Go ahead and take care
 of our little gym rat problem.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.685
   I'd do it myself, but
   lowell tracey's invited me

29:14.687 --> 29:16.487
       To preview the new
       pocket dial album.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.088
              Who?

29:18.090 --> 29:20.791
     You need to listen to
     something other than
      bob seger, my man.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.535
   Mr. Kaiser? I didn't think
   i'd be sharing the ride
   to lunch with you.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.003
          You're not.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.105
   Here's where things stand.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.040
   I'm tired of your brains.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.610
      These visions from
      runaways and junkies

29:39.612 --> 29:41.111
   Are worse than depressing.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.579
        They're boring.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.081
         I want better.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.250
 And i see an opportunity here.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.851
      For the both of us.

29:47.853 --> 29:50.454
      My whole life
      i wanted one thing.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.856
      To be an astronaut.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.792
    You know why i couldn't?

29:54.794 --> 29:57.127
  Low distance vision acuity.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.962
        Did i quit? No.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.998
        I worked. Hard.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.766
       I made my fortune

30:02.768 --> 30:06.470
 And i bought myself a ticket
 on the first commercial flight
 into space.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.505
      And do you know
      what happened then?

30:08.507 --> 30:09.606
             What?

30:09.608 --> 30:12.242
       You. You happened.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.845
   Two days after i passed my
   zero-gravity training,

30:14.847 --> 30:19.049
    You and that disgusting
    fingernail of yours
    ruined my life.

30:19.051 --> 30:22.019
      I can't exactly
      pass a physical as
      a zombie, now can i?

30:22.021 --> 30:26.089
   But i will know what it's
   like to be out there
   among the stars.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.491
  And you're going to help me.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.326
    And how am i doing that?

30:29.328 --> 30:32.129
    You're going to get me
    the brain of alan york.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.064
   Alan york? The astronaut?

30:34.066 --> 30:35.999
    One of the first men to
    walk on the moon.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.301
    I want to eat his brain.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.436
  I think he's still using it.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.805
      Like that's ever
      stopped you before.

30:41.807 --> 30:45.075
  Somehow, i suspect
  he'll be a lot slower than
  the average teenage junkie.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.277
     How the hell am i
     getting to alan york?

30:47.279 --> 30:49.880
   I think all i'm tasked
   with here is pointing out
   what i want

30:49.882 --> 30:51.448
        And then writing
        you a check.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.750
       So, why don't you
       just tell me,

30:54.920 --> 30:57.387
      What amount am i
      writing on it? Hmm?

31:03.863 --> 31:05.195
            (sniffs)

31:07.199 --> 31:08.699
    Liv: What're you doing?

31:08.701 --> 31:09.967
           (clatters)

31:10.703 --> 31:12.636
     What? Nothing. Just...

31:13.873 --> 31:15.906
    Uh. When did you get in?

31:15.908 --> 31:17.975
     Everett's brains came
     with stealth mode.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.111
     I believe i have some
     happy news.

31:21.113 --> 31:22.446
           Uh...
           (chuckles)

31:22.448 --> 31:25.382
  Zombieism doesn't appear
  able to jump across species.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.117
 When was that even a question?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.254
  When the zombie rat bit me.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.789
  You had more than
  enough on your plate.
  I didn't want to worry you.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.691
      Next time worry me.

31:34.693 --> 31:38.362
    We're in this together.
    I've got your six, ravi.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.696
      Roger that, soldier.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.533
     Do you have time
     to look at a couple of
     youtube videos?

31:43.535 --> 31:45.369
 Of failed twerking tutorials?

31:45.371 --> 31:46.470
              Yes.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.705
     But no one lipsyncing
     to <i> frozen.</i>

31:48.707 --> 31:52.342
  After the taylors' neighbor
  accused sean of messing with
  the systems in his house,

31:52.344 --> 31:55.212
   I did some digging on
   sean's company, remoticon.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.614
      Among their clients?
      Ufreighteze.

31:57.616 --> 31:58.882
          Watch this.

31:58.884 --> 32:00.150
     (soft jingle playing)

32:00.152 --> 32:01.785
         (child crying)

32:02.788 --> 32:04.321
       Woman:
      <i> It's okay, sweetie.</i>

32:04.323 --> 32:06.523
       Announcer:
       <i> America's favorite</i>

32:10.162 --> 32:12.262
         Woman:
        <i> Ufreighteze sky.</i>

32:12.264 --> 32:13.997
    <i> Because you need it now.</i>

32:15.000 --> 32:17.467
     Liv: And this
     informs our case how?

32:17.469 --> 32:19.369
     Remoticon is supplying
     ufreighteze

32:19.371 --> 32:21.171
        With the drone
        guidance system.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.873
     Are you picking up
     what i'm putting down?

32:22.875 --> 32:24.341
     Surely you
     can't be suggesting...

32:24.343 --> 32:26.443
     Oh, yeah, i am.
     Check this video out.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.112
     You can find them all
     over the internet.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.948
          -(gunshot)
          -(explosion)

32:30.950 --> 32:33.784
   And i am officially never
   going outside ever again.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.119
    That's why you found
    the shell casing
    where you did.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.355
     The drone was 15 feet
     off the ground.

32:38.357 --> 32:42.025
      Halfway along what
      the csi guys told us
      was the trajectory.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.928
  That yuppie sack of crap
  sat in his corporate meeting

32:44.930 --> 32:46.897
      And murdered everett
      from his tablet.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.834
    Man over phone:
   <i> How soon will you be here?</i>

32:50.836 --> 32:53.003
  We're aiming to be out there
  in a couple weeks.

32:53.005 --> 32:55.005
     I busted my ass
     to get this promotion.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.573
       I'm going to enjoy
       a little r&r

32:56.575 --> 32:58.342
      Before i get back
      in the thick of it.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.610
  <i> We're so pleased</i>
  <i> your circumstances changed,</i>

33:00.612 --> 33:02.612
     <i> Chief digital officer.</i>

33:04.516 --> 33:06.116
       I'm gonna have to
       call you back.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.287
             Penny?

33:13.425 --> 33:15.125
       (camera clicking)

33:18.530 --> 33:19.963
      -What're you...
      -Clive: Mr. Taylor.

33:19.965 --> 33:23.433
 Our computer forensics experts
 have a question about

33:23.435 --> 33:27.371
   3d printer schematics
   for a .38 caliber handgun

33:27.373 --> 33:30.974
 Mounted on a ufreighteze drone
 they found on your laptop.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.411
   We have a search warrant,
   by the way.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.214
 Penny gave us your passwords.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.282
        Said you had
        nothing to hide.

33:40.753 --> 33:43.487
      Penny: What the hell
      did you do, sean?

33:43.489 --> 33:45.355
     He was anna's father.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.902
           (grunting)

33:58.904 --> 34:00.404
             Nerds.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.906
     -This'll be easier on
     you if you don't move.
     -(yelping)

34:04.009 --> 34:05.575
          Sean taylor,

34:05.577 --> 34:08.011
       You have the right
       to remain silent.

34:08.013 --> 34:12.416
 Anything you say or do
 can and will be used
 against you in a court of law.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.520
     Liv: <i> There are monsters</i>
    <i> in this world.</i>

34:19.591 --> 34:21.992
      <i> People who do</i>
      <i> unspeakable things.</i>

34:28.167 --> 34:31.068
  <i> When i graduated med school,</i>
  <i> i took an oath</i>

34:32.471 --> 34:36.139
    <i> To consecrate my life to</i>
    <i> the service of humanity,</i>

34:36.141 --> 34:39.208
   <i> To respect and value</i>
   <i> the lives of all persons.</i>

34:40.746 --> 34:42.679
  <i> But now that i'm half-dead,</i>

34:42.681 --> 34:46.016
    <i> I can see that some life</i>
    <i> is like a virus.</i>

34:46.018 --> 34:47.918
       <i> One that can't be</i>
       <i> allowed to spread.</i>

34:56.295 --> 34:58.028
       (flipping switch)

35:13.045 --> 35:14.678
          -(grunting)
          -(retching)

35:15.214 --> 35:16.279
            Oh, ho.

35:17.583 --> 35:18.648
             Argh!

35:25.724 --> 35:28.391
   You're gonna tell me who
   you've told about brains.

35:28.927 --> 35:29.993
           (grunting)

35:30.829 --> 35:32.662
  Then this will all be over.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.097
           (panting)

35:40.272 --> 35:43.206
       Okay, pretty boy.
       I'm gonna ask you
        one more time.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.809
     Who have you
     told about the brains?

35:46.311 --> 35:47.878
           (grunting)

35:47.880 --> 35:49.312
    Now, answer me straight,

35:49.314 --> 35:52.249
    Or i'm gonna take you
    on a guided tour
    through a world of pain.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.117
     I don't know anything!

35:54.119 --> 35:55.752
      (clicks tongue) ahh.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.021
     Then i guess it's all
     aboard the pain train.

35:58.023 --> 35:59.623
          First stop,

35:59.625 --> 36:01.024
        Hand francisco.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.760
          (screaming)

36:03.762 --> 36:05.061
           (moaning)

36:07.166 --> 36:08.465
            (grunts)

36:08.934 --> 36:10.033
           (exhales)

36:23.916 --> 36:25.115
           (gunshots)

36:26.385 --> 36:27.684
           (grunting)

36:43.101 --> 36:44.401
           (gagging)

36:44.870 --> 36:46.336
          (screaming)

36:46.338 --> 36:47.504
           (gunshot)

36:47.506 --> 36:48.905
      (empty gun clicking)

36:56.982 --> 36:58.982
        Cheers again for
        the prime cuts.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.419
     I figured an occasion
     like this called for
      something special.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.154
       To old clients...

37:04.823 --> 37:06.489
        And new friends.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.733
    You limeys sure can put
    it away, can't you?

37:17.569 --> 37:18.635
         Dammit, move.

37:19.137 --> 37:20.570

37:24.676 --> 37:26.176
    Everything okay, <i> amigo?</i>

37:27.246 --> 37:29.646
      Ah... Just getting
      a bit toasty is all.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.381
        Um... I'm just
        gonna move this.

37:36.822 --> 37:38.655
        -Better?
        -It's all good.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.659
          (inaudible)

37:49.868 --> 37:51.067
             Do it.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.305
             Do it.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.741
      Liv: <i> I said some life</i>
     <i> is like a virus.</i>

37:57.743 --> 37:59.943
    <i> But if you kill a virus,</i>
    <i> you're a doctor.</i>

38:00.946 --> 38:02.879
    <i> If you kill a person...</i>

38:05.250 --> 38:08.118
     <i> If i kill this person,</i>
     <i> i know who i'll be.</i>

38:12.291 --> 38:14.024
       <i> I'll be a killer.</i>

38:15.027 --> 38:17.260
          <i> I'll be him.</i>

38:17.262 --> 38:20.030
     Blaine: You really
     gotta get down
     to the cobain exhibit.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.998
      Hell, i'll go again
      if you're up for it.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.467
     You know, i purchased
     a kurt cobain jaguar
       from a collector

38:24.469 --> 38:26.202
  With my first advance money.

38:26.204 --> 38:28.505
      -You're kidding me?
      -Fancy a go?

38:28.507 --> 38:31.441
      I would literally
      never forgive myself
      if i said no.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.609
       Wait right there.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.177
           (chuckles)

38:43.722 --> 38:45.255
     (cell phone vibrating)

38:55.701 --> 38:57.000
            (sighs)

38:59.471 --> 39:00.770
          Where is he?

39:00.772 --> 39:03.340
    (stuttering)
    i'm sorry, i didn't even
    know who to call.

39:03.342 --> 39:04.908
  I have no idea who i even...

39:04.910 --> 39:08.345
       Hey, you need to
       pull it together.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.114
 If you shot an armed intruder,
 this is going to get hairy.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.216
       But you didn't
       do anything wrong.

39:13.218 --> 39:14.517
        I killed a man.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.687
            Show me.

39:19.891 --> 39:20.957
             Here?

39:24.763 --> 39:27.197
    You know,
    he collapsed right here.

39:28.567 --> 39:31.735
    (stammering)
    no, i shot him.
    I shot him three times.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.604
  When people are shot
  multiple times in the chest,

39:34.606 --> 39:36.139
      They tend to bleed.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.942
   And he threw a freaking
   sledgehammer at me. Look!

39:38.944 --> 39:41.945
   I can't know if that mark
   was or wasn't there
   before tonight.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.747
   I'm telling you it wasn't!

39:43.749 --> 39:46.549
  He must've just
  gone out the window, but...

39:49.388 --> 39:50.487
          He was dead.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.824
  Hey, man, i'm...
  I'm telling you, all right?

39:54.826 --> 39:56.760
     I got him right here.

39:57.229 --> 39:58.695
          Three times.

40:05.303 --> 40:06.936
     Major, i gotta ask...

40:09.241 --> 40:11.775
      Have you been taking
      any medications?

40:12.411 --> 40:14.144
              No.

40:14.146 --> 40:16.212
  Have you stopped taking any?

40:18.817 --> 40:19.883
           (faintly)
           what?

40:20.452 --> 40:21.551
            Behold.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.119
       Look, i gotta go.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.187
        (clears throat)

40:25.023 --> 40:26.322
              Wow.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.927
        This is unreal.
        (chuckles)

40:30.929 --> 40:32.729
       (phone vibrating)

40:39.704 --> 40:41.471
       (starts strumming)

40:42.507 --> 40:44.140
        (phone ringing)

40:49.080 --> 40:50.747
     Get comfortable, kid.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.749
            (grunts)
            ugh.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.688
    Say good night, gracie.

40:59.357 --> 41:00.890
        (phone ringing)

41:05.163 --> 41:08.364
  Seen that look before.
  Where'd that trip take you?

41:11.169 --> 41:12.869
     Looked like bonnaroo.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.938
   (phone continues ringing)

41:19.144 --> 41:21.377
       Hey. How'd it go?

41:23.181 --> 41:25.815
   What? That's unacceptable.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.150
    What the hell happened?

41:29.654 --> 41:32.088
 No, no.
 You stay right where you are.

41:33.625 --> 41:34.924
           (mouthing)

41:36.194 --> 41:38.628
              No.

41:38.630 --> 41:41.965
  Blaine: You stay
  where you are. I'm en route.
  (hangs up)

41:41.967 --> 41:44.300
       Hey, man.
       Sorry, i gotta go.
       Work emergency.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.769
      Look, if you wanna
      go to that exhibit,
       you just gotta...

41:48.607 --> 41:50.306
      You're a lousy host.

41:50.308 --> 41:51.908
           (gunshot)

41:51.910 --> 41:52.976
          (screaming)

42:01.219 --> 42:02.685
          (whimpering)
