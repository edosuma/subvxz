WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.505
I've got homework.
Who called the family meeting?

00:04.605 --> 00:08.342
I did.
We have a problem.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.010
Wait,
there's no push-back

00:10.111 --> 00:11.745
on me calling
a family meeting?

00:11.845 --> 00:12.913
Aww.
I love you guys.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.448
(indistinct chatter)
Stop!

00:14.548 --> 00:16.016
Down!

00:16.117 --> 00:19.053
College-application
time.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.388
JJ's not taking it
seriously.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.922
Seniors were supposed

00:22.022 --> 00:23.091
to hand in this essay
a week ago.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.926
Why haven't you done it?
It's really important.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.361
"It is.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.531
But there's so much
good TV these days."

00:30.631 --> 00:33.534
Living in the golden age
of content is no excuse, JJ.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.535
Your father and I
will support

00:34.635 --> 00:35.503
whatever hopes
you have for college,

00:35.603 --> 00:37.171
but you got
to take the lead.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.108
Let's talk essay.
What is your passion?

00:42.610 --> 00:45.012
P-O-O--

00:45.113 --> 00:46.847
No, JJ, not buying it.

00:46.947 --> 00:47.781
Pretending
you have to poop

00:47.881 --> 00:48.849
has gotten you
out of enough jams.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.051
You have passions.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.853
Let's put our heads together.
We got this.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.188
**

00:54.288 --> 00:55.756
I've got it!

00:55.856 --> 00:56.990
What's your passion?

00:57.091 --> 00:58.726
"Short essays."
Done.

00:58.826 --> 00:59.693
Eh?

00:59.793 --> 01:01.229
We all hate it

01:01.329 --> 01:03.030
when you try and think
outside the box.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.032
Yeah.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.734
Oh, I know!
Giving back to society.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.436
When has he ever?

01:08.536 --> 01:10.003
Never. He'll start.
Type.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.406
(keyboard clacking)
"...and make our world

01:12.506 --> 01:15.943
a better place
for us all."

01:16.043 --> 01:19.079
Perfect.
JJ?

01:19.180 --> 01:20.714
**

01:20.814 --> 01:22.450
That is not
what you just said to him.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.218
I told him
what he needed to hear.

01:24.318 --> 01:28.088
(sighs) Oh, you can't
be mad, though, can you?
TV's too bloody good.

01:28.189 --> 01:32.059
**

01:32.160 --> 01:33.694
Mom, Dad?

01:33.794 --> 01:34.728
I don't ask for much.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.664
I don't drive a fancy car

01:36.764 --> 01:38.065
or wear the latest fashions
from Milan.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.669
Can I have a pet snake?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.337
-Don't be ridiculous!
-Not on your life.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.505
I understand.

01:44.605 --> 01:48.209
**

01:48.309 --> 01:49.277
(snake hissing)

01:49.377 --> 01:52.780
So, you're gonna be
a secret snake.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.415
Sssssss!

01:56.049 --> 01:57.218
What is it, darling?

01:57.318 --> 01:58.486
Danton College?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.354
That's six hours away.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.356
"But it's good for"...

02:02.456 --> 02:03.991
E-N-- "engineering.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.193
It's my passion."

02:05.293 --> 02:06.194
Really?

02:06.294 --> 02:07.495
Buddy, you do know
that an engineer

02:07.595 --> 02:10.164
isn't the guy who drives
the train, right?

02:10.264 --> 02:13.834
He also has to inspect
and maintain the train.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.537
"I want to make things.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.538
My life is a"...

02:17.638 --> 02:18.739
P-U-- "puzzle.

02:18.839 --> 02:22.610
I want to find solutions
and help people."

02:22.710 --> 02:24.945
Well, that is beautiful.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.680
I told you we were
good parents!

02:26.780 --> 02:28.048
Agree to disagree.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.783
JJ, engineering
is your passion?

02:29.883 --> 02:31.018
You've never mentioned it.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.153
"I didn't think it was"...

02:33.254 --> 02:37.358
P-O-- "possible until now."

02:37.458 --> 02:38.926
Oh, they've got
a tour this weekend.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.428
"Can we go?

02:40.528 --> 02:43.231
It would be a"...
D-R-- "dream."

02:44.998 --> 02:47.335
(sighs)
Look at his face.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.570
It's six hours away.
It's not practical.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.071
I think we have to have
a hard conversation.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.674
Let me take this one?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.043
Buddy,
we believe in you,

02:56.143 --> 02:59.413
but you going to a college
that far away --

02:59.513 --> 03:00.448
Overruled!

03:00.548 --> 03:01.582
How dare you
limit our son?!

03:01.682 --> 03:03.717
JJ, go and pack.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.419
Did you know
we were going to do that?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.888
You know what, don't tell me.
Ruins the magic.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.825
Gents. Parents are away
for the weekend.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.527
Throwing
a little get-together.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.029
You guys are invited.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.064
"A night
of fantasy gaming.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.366
When the parents
are away,

03:18.466 --> 03:21.235
the kids shall...
roleplay?"

03:21.335 --> 03:22.770
Uh...

03:22.870 --> 03:25.105
(chuckles)
Yeah, we'll see.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.209
All right,
seven yeses.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.414
Ray, buddy, no one's
gonna go to this.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.082
Those kids want
to go to parties.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.317
Oh, no,
this high school

03:36.417 --> 03:37.851
doesn't actually
have parties.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.321
That stuff's just a myth
created by Hollywood elites.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.522
(sighs)

03:43.257 --> 03:45.259
Oh, Ray...

03:45.359 --> 03:46.394
This high school
has parties?

03:46.494 --> 03:47.428
Mm-hmm.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.531
All right, new plan --
I'm throwing a real party.

03:50.631 --> 03:51.732
As the coolest guy
I know,

03:51.832 --> 03:53.934
I want you to handle
the guest list.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.068
Oh, invite
your brother!

03:55.168 --> 03:57.271
You for real?
My brother's crazy.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.673
I want him --
and his friends.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.175
And tell him to bring...

04:02.276 --> 04:03.544
(whispers)
...liquid refreshments.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.578
(scoffs)
It's your party.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.247
Also, remind me,
do parties at this school

04:07.348 --> 04:09.249
usually have,
like, themes?

04:09.350 --> 04:10.551
What?
No.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.186
I was just kidding,
Justin.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.222
Comedy.

04:15.323 --> 04:19.727
**

04:19.827 --> 04:22.530
Maya: Come on, Dylan!
Let's get on the road!

04:22.630 --> 04:24.398
Coming!
(sighs)

04:24.498 --> 04:26.567
Off to college,
Dylan Junior.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.201
I'll miss...you.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.405
Snakes can escape?!

04:33.441 --> 04:34.542
What were you
doing back there?

04:34.642 --> 04:37.411
I'm...restoring
an antique piano.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.512
Oh, okay.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.247
Have a good weekend, guys.
Ta-ta.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.249
Wait.
Ray's staying here?

04:42.350 --> 04:44.318
Yeah, we weren't sure
about leaving a teenager
alone for the weekend,

04:44.418 --> 04:47.521
but, I mean,
the guy just said, "Ta-ta."

04:49.823 --> 04:54.061
Let's just hope this isn't
the big...ta-ta.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.701
Finally!
A little love around here.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.874
(Bob Seger's "Old Time
Rock And Roll" playing)

05:06.974 --> 05:07.908
Aah!

05:08.008 --> 05:10.444
Ohh!
Ohh, that's a nail!

05:10.544 --> 05:12.079
(grunts)
That's a nail!

05:12.179 --> 05:13.947
Ohh! Ohh!
Mommy, come home!

05:14.047 --> 05:15.483
(knock on door)

05:15.583 --> 05:17.317
(music stops)

05:17.418 --> 05:20.888
'Sup, Ray?
Party's in here, boys.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.256
What is this?
Who are all these kids?

05:23.357 --> 05:24.825
You said to invite
my brother and his friends.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.361
I meant your cool
older brother.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.029
Why would
he come to your party?

05:29.129 --> 05:30.097
The dude's
got a moustache.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.232
Thanks, Justin.
I owe you.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.067
(scoffs) I'm gonna
hold you to that, Karen.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.202
(laughs)

05:35.302 --> 05:36.504
What the hell
is happening?!

05:36.604 --> 05:38.906
Babysitting ring, bro.
I make mad coin.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.608
And, uh, the moms
ain't that bad, either.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.042
Have a fun party, Ray.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.176
You're not even
staying?

05:43.276 --> 05:45.245
Oh, heads up. If Trevor
has peanuts, he'll die.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.615
Don't let him trick you.
Dude loves peanuts.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.316
**

05:49.417 --> 05:50.684
Sucks for Trevor.

05:50.784 --> 05:55.222
Hey, can I have some peanuts?
My name's Chase.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.725
This place is gorgeous.
Look at this quad.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.661
Quad? At these prices,
it should be a quint!

06:00.761 --> 06:03.230
(women scoff)
Laughing at great jokes
is un-PC now, huh?

06:03.330 --> 06:04.264
Snowflakes.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.833
What do you think
of this place, JJ?

06:05.933 --> 06:08.235
"It's perfect."

06:08.335 --> 06:10.070
Should we go find
that tour?

06:10.170 --> 06:11.505
Dylan: "There's a"...

06:11.605 --> 06:15.375
S-T-- "student-only tour
I want to take."

06:15.476 --> 06:18.612
So independent.
All right, go forth, son.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.613
Come back with dreadlocks

06:20.648 --> 06:21.381
and tell me how everything
I know is incorrect.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.718
We are gonna
break his heart.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.920
Set aside the fact that
this place is six hours away,

06:27.020 --> 06:28.321
we're never gonna be able
to afford this tuition.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.658
Oh, come on.
Of course --

06:30.758 --> 06:32.593
(gasps)
Good God!

06:32.693 --> 06:34.495
That's just for JJ?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.329
Why do we have
so many children?

06:36.430 --> 06:37.598
Uh, look,
you know what,

06:37.698 --> 06:39.900
we'll go by the financial-aid
office and have a talk.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.069
You just couldn't keep your
bloody hands off me, could you?

06:42.169 --> 06:43.370
(chuckles)

06:43.471 --> 06:45.439
JJ,
where are you going?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.708
You said the tour
was meeting back there.

06:47.808 --> 06:51.512
"We're not here
for the tour."

06:51.612 --> 06:53.380
**

06:53.481 --> 06:54.414
Are they filming
a movie?

06:54.515 --> 06:56.584
JJ?

06:56.684 --> 06:57.585
JJ DiMeo's here!

06:57.685 --> 06:59.653
Wait!
JJ, you're in this?

06:59.753 --> 07:02.189
We didn't come here
so you could tour the college,

07:02.289 --> 07:04.257
we came here so you could
be in some movie?

07:04.357 --> 07:06.026
This isn't
"some movie."

07:06.126 --> 07:08.596
This is "Bikini University 3:
Horny Homecoming."

07:08.696 --> 07:13.366
**

07:13.467 --> 07:16.269
"I'm sorry,
I'm gross."

07:16.369 --> 07:19.106
No, it's what
you should have said.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.211
JJ!

07:24.311 --> 07:26.346
I'm Frank Dante,
the director.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.415
So glad
you answered our ad.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.483
Dylan:
"It's an honor.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.352
I loved
'Bikini University 2:

07:32.452 --> 07:33.487
The Dean's"...
Ahh!

07:33.587 --> 07:35.322
R-E-- "Revenge.'"

07:35.422 --> 07:36.724
Kid, you don't know
how happy that makes me.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.759
People say
that today's teens

07:38.859 --> 07:40.661
don't want raunchy comedies
like "Bikini U."

07:40.761 --> 07:46.066
"I do.
Gimme. Gimme. Gimme."

07:47.400 --> 07:48.502
"Gimme."

07:48.602 --> 07:50.170
I like this kid!

07:50.270 --> 07:52.272
JJ! Mom and Dad
are gonna kill you

07:52.372 --> 07:54.842
when I tell them
why we're really here.

07:54.942 --> 07:59.446
"If you do, I'll tell them
about your S--"

07:59.547 --> 08:01.549
You know
about my snake?!

08:01.649 --> 08:04.484
How? We've been so careful
when I haven't lost him.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.720
Hi! We're gonna be
working together!

08:06.820 --> 08:10.357
I'm Ally, but my character's
name is Bikini Boobs.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.192
(laughs)
"I'm JJ.

08:12.292 --> 08:16.196
My character is
Bikini Boobs...

08:16.296 --> 08:20.400
In Face...
Wheelchair Boy."

08:20.500 --> 08:24.337
(sighs) You suck.
Like, a lot.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.073
We have many financial-aid
packages available.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.508
Take a look.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.012
(clicks tongue)
Pauline, do you know,

08:32.112 --> 08:34.181
I've never said this
to a woman before.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.216
But I want to make you
fall in love with me,

08:36.316 --> 08:39.386
give myself to you -- once --
then break your heart.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.420
And when you ask me why,

08:40.520 --> 08:43.056
I'm gonna say,
"'Cause of that chart."

08:43.156 --> 08:45.859
That was fun. Uh, wait,
this looks interesting.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.595
Uh, 80% off tuition?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.496
Uh, that's for kids
of Danton employees.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.731
Oh, we can do that.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.065
I'll move up here
and I'll get a job.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.100
But what would you do?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.702
Clerical work,
be an assistant.

08:54.802 --> 08:55.736
You know,
I'll start at the bottom.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.370
(snickers)

08:57.470 --> 08:58.338
Why are you laughing?

08:58.438 --> 09:00.507
You, starting
at the bottom.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.075
Answering to someone,
taking orders --

09:02.175 --> 09:03.944
You know what? Actually,
could you get me that pen?
Get it yourself.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.412
Yeah, that was a test.
You want to know how you did?

09:05.512 --> 09:07.881
(sighs)
So I'm a natural alpha.

09:07.981 --> 09:08.982
Sue me.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.218
Look, if I've got to slum it
to help my son,

09:11.318 --> 09:12.252
then that's
what I'll do.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.921
Don't believe me?
Look, I'll show you.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.725
Your pen.
That's actually my pen.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.327
Lady, I've had it up to here
with you!

09:20.427 --> 09:23.063
(children yelling)

09:23.163 --> 09:24.231
Oh, it's so loud.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.333
Just be quiet!

09:26.433 --> 09:28.936
(yelling stops)
(ball bouncing)

09:29.036 --> 09:32.439
Ugh. Don't do that.
Now it's just eerie.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.074
(door closes)

09:34.174 --> 09:35.609
(children laughing)
Ray!

09:35.709 --> 09:38.846
You got me out of a hot tub
with a Shakira look-alike

09:38.946 --> 09:40.648
to show me you started
a day-care center?

09:40.748 --> 09:43.516
I tried to throw a party with
the coolest kids from school,

09:43.617 --> 09:45.018
and this
is who showed up.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.354
I'm a total loser.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.256
Hey, Ray, come on.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.758
This could be
a good thing.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.425
You want to be cool?

09:52.525 --> 09:55.028
Start with
an easy crowd first.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.897
Kevin Hart
did open mics

09:56.997 --> 09:58.498
before he could
fill stadiums.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.200
Baseball players
start in the minors

10:00.300 --> 10:01.735
before they hit
the big leagues.

10:01.835 --> 10:05.839
Or rock stars.
There's a lot of examples.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.008
I guess it's a very
basic concept.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.443
How do I even impress
10-year-olds?

10:10.543 --> 10:12.079
(chuckles)
Well, it's easy.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.213
Hey, yo!
Listen up!

10:13.313 --> 10:14.982
This guy
right here...

10:15.082 --> 10:15.916
(laughs)

10:16.016 --> 10:17.918
...he just said
the "A" word.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.655
(admiring exclamations)

10:21.755 --> 10:22.923
Yeah, no,
I'm not above this.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.659
Okay, so, Dean Dinkins
does his line...

10:25.759 --> 10:27.928
"Shut this party down
before you ruin everything!

10:28.028 --> 10:29.396
I'm trying
to sell this college,

10:29.496 --> 10:30.563
and I won't
have you blow it!"

10:30.664 --> 10:34.501
Then I say to JJ,
"Your nose looks cold."

10:34.601 --> 10:37.270
And then I stick my chest
in your face...

10:37.370 --> 10:39.006
Then the dean talks.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.608
"Shouldn't we
rehearse that part?"

10:41.709 --> 10:44.011
Oh, no.
That part's easy.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.413
JJ, why is your nose
even cold?

10:46.513 --> 10:49.082
Oh, because the frat guys
locked him in a freezer.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.183
But then I come
and warm him up.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.484
(giggles)

10:51.584 --> 10:53.420
"What might
that look like?"

10:53.520 --> 10:56.489
Ugh, I'm really struggling
with my character.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.524
Hopefully,
I'll just be amazing

10:57.624 --> 10:58.658
when we shoot it,
for some reason.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.394
"One"...
S-U-- "suggestion.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.364
Say your line
as you're walking out."

11:04.464 --> 11:08.501
**

11:08.601 --> 11:10.670
I like it.
Do you direct?

11:10.771 --> 11:14.007
"No, I just watch
lots of movies."

11:14.107 --> 11:16.109
Thanks, Boobs in Face
Wheelchair Boy.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.544
(sighs)

11:17.644 --> 11:19.679
(knock on door)

11:19.780 --> 11:21.148
Hello. I have the groceries
you ordered.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.549
You're the person
the app sent?

11:22.649 --> 11:23.683
I know I don't
look the part,

11:23.784 --> 11:25.018
but I'm using
this app

11:25.118 --> 11:26.887
to prove I can take orders
and hold a job

11:26.987 --> 11:28.722
so my son can attend
the school of his dreams.

11:28.822 --> 11:29.857
No,
I was just confused.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.859
It says here
you're a man named Mayo.

11:31.959 --> 11:36.730
A thousand apologies,
oh, great Dave G.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.498
(sighs) This was
the best grapefruit?

11:38.598 --> 11:41.068
Well, you asked for
the "dankest grapefruit,"

11:41.168 --> 11:42.502
which seemed subjective.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.871
And I asked for Advil.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.038
Oh, I got you
the generic brand.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.606
It's the same thing.
I saved you 3 bucks.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.742
You should've gotten me Advil.
This stuff sucks.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.210
It's literally
the same thing.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.178
Are you arguing
with me?

11:51.278 --> 11:54.247
No! I'm being correct
near an idiot.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.382
**

11:55.482 --> 11:56.716
(upbeat funk music playing)

11:56.817 --> 12:00.888
Hey, Ray, we wanted
to play some Minecraft.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.155
What are your rules
on screen time?

12:02.255 --> 12:03.356
It's a party, man.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.893
Unlimited...
within reason.

12:05.993 --> 12:06.894
-Yes!
-Yes!

12:06.994 --> 12:09.529
Dude, I saw this kit
in the store.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.998
The box says
16 and older.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.600
Wish I'd known that
when I built it.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.668
When I was 13.

12:15.769 --> 12:16.603
Whoa.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.105
Juice box me.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.242
It's all good.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.244
I know
what "doing it" is.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.147
He gave you one star,
and the comment is,

12:27.247 --> 12:28.681
"Why can't I give
zero stars?"

12:28.782 --> 12:29.716
Oh, for God's sake!

12:29.817 --> 12:31.852
I had no idea
how hard it was

12:31.952 --> 12:33.253
to let people
walk all over you.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.587
What can I say,
some of us just have

12:34.687 --> 12:36.857
a flair
for being emasculated.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.258
Look, this place
is crazy expensive.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.893
I-I don't think
it's meant to be.

12:39.993 --> 12:43.030
We'll talk to JJ,
and it'll be okay.
Okay.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.833
This grapefruit
is not dank!

12:45.933 --> 12:48.902
Well, feed it to your three
"Scarface" posters, jackass!

12:49.002 --> 12:49.937
You would not believe

12:50.037 --> 12:52.339
how often people
come up to me and say,

12:52.439 --> 12:56.109
"Frank, I love the 'Bikini
University' movies,

12:56.209 --> 12:57.310
and I'm a woman."

12:57.410 --> 12:59.746
**

12:59.847 --> 13:02.482
(cellphone chimes)

13:02.582 --> 13:03.550
Uh-oh.
Mom and Dad.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.718
"Where's JJ?
We need to talk."

13:05.819 --> 13:07.921
It's almost time
for your big scene, JJ.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.657
Wait.
What's wrong?

13:10.757 --> 13:13.894
**

13:13.994 --> 13:16.663
"Want to do
some real acting?"

13:16.763 --> 13:18.565
**

13:18.665 --> 13:19.933
Hey.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.168
We thought you guys
were on the tour.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.837
We're sorry, but it's not
a realistic option.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.606
Can we start heading back
and talk about it in the car?

13:26.706 --> 13:29.242
JJ, there you are!
I brought someone.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.845
Dean Dinkins,
this is JJ DiMeo.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.147
JJ, I hear you're looking to
join our engineering department.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.583
Son, you seem like
Danton material

13:36.683 --> 13:37.851
through and through.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.487
You're the dean?
You're very young.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.654
And...hot.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.656
(chuckles)
I get that a lot.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.558
Working with quality
young people like JJ here

13:45.658 --> 13:47.760
is my own
fountain of youth.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.063
Yeah, JJ is awesome.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.198
Well,
he made a friend.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.601
And she's hot.
She's like Dean Dinkins hot.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.668
JJ, let's get back.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.071
That math equation
isn't gonna solve itself.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.940
May I borrow him?
For math.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.243
**

14:03.343 --> 14:04.377
Well, we can't quit,

14:04.477 --> 14:05.412
'cause it's his dream,
isn't it?

14:05.512 --> 14:06.846
Go on,
open that app again.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.916
(upbeat pop music playing)
Ah, look at you.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.317
Feeling confident, huh?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.719
My man,
I own this crowd.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.255
I've got them wrapped
around my finger.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.090
And once they see
my magic act...

14:17.190 --> 14:18.992
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Too confident.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.060
Too confident!

14:20.160 --> 14:21.328
Too confident my "A."

14:21.428 --> 14:23.563
Kids, pop a squat.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.898
I can't watch this.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.199
I'm calling
weird-eye Shakira

14:26.299 --> 14:27.667
to tell her to
fire the tub back up.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.669
**

14:29.769 --> 14:31.171
(dramatic rock music playing)

14:31.271 --> 14:36.109
We perceive our world
through our five senses.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.577
Or do we?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.146
(children gasping)

14:39.246 --> 14:40.647
Oh, you ain't
seen nothin' yet.

14:40.747 --> 14:44.417
(snake hissing)
Now I will remove my thumb.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.385
(admiring exclamations)

14:45.485 --> 14:46.653
I know, right?

14:46.753 --> 14:48.021
Awesome!

14:48.121 --> 14:52.325
(hissing continues)

14:52.425 --> 14:54.427
(high-pitched scream)
(laughter)

14:54.527 --> 14:56.729
Uh, grab some of that
equipment and follow me.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.731
Oh, with pleasure.
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

14:58.831 --> 15:00.267
Don't hold back.
Treat me like garbage.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.169
I am your peon.
No, just that.

15:02.269 --> 15:06.039
So this is for a movie?
What are you filming?

15:06.139 --> 15:07.007
Okay, everyone,
come in quick.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.976
We'll hide from the snake
in here.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.543
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.844
**

15:11.945 --> 15:14.181
No one else is afraid
of the snake?

15:14.281 --> 15:17.717
(children chanting "Babies!")

15:17.817 --> 15:20.387
I've got bad news for you,
Austin.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.888
Those babies are us.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.591
Frank, we are way behind.
We gotta do this.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.027
Fine, but I need a rehearsal.
Where's Bikini Boobs?

15:27.127 --> 15:27.995
Still in makeup.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.164
Well, just get me
a stand-in. Anybody!

15:31.264 --> 15:33.433
Hey, you, app lady.
Come with me.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.668
Stand right here.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.869
Face this way.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.706
I mean, for five stars, I really
would stand in a volcano.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.242
Where's our
horny wheelchair kid?

15:42.342 --> 15:43.376
(wheels screech)

15:43.476 --> 15:45.478
**

15:45.578 --> 15:47.880
That's my
horny wheelchair kid.

15:47.981 --> 15:51.985
JJ, I've lost sight
of Dad and...Mom.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.754
I'm just gonna come clean.
I have a snake.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.493
So that's why we're here?
We drove six hours,

16:00.593 --> 16:02.162
we agonized over
how to pay for it.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.031
I was gonna get a job up here,
and for what?

16:04.131 --> 16:05.832
So you could
roll around a movie set

16:05.932 --> 16:07.167
and nuzzle some girl's
chest puppies?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.701
You made your mother
say "chest puppies."

16:08.801 --> 16:11.671
"In the movie's defense,

16:11.771 --> 16:16.043
they cast an actual
wheelchair user for the part."

16:16.143 --> 16:18.078
Yeah, that is actually laudable.
Credit where credit's due.
Sure.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.414
Doesn't change anything.
You lied!

16:21.514 --> 16:23.050
You lied.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.753
We were so happy that
you'd found a passion.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.921
"You're"...D-R-- "dreaming

16:29.022 --> 16:31.358
if you think
I could go"...

16:31.458 --> 16:34.694
S-O-- "someplace
like this."

16:34.794 --> 16:37.164
I'm not buying
your excuses anymore.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.199
We take you seriously.
It's time you did, too.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.267
Congratulations, JJ.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.203
You've been accepted
to college...with honors.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.939
Dean Dinkins, I'm gonna
make you fall in love with me,

16:47.040 --> 16:49.209
then I'm gon--
Okay, you -- Just go.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.643
Time to say goodbye
to your friends.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.915
"I'm sorry.
I have to leave."

16:56.015 --> 16:57.317
Eh, scene's a wreck,
anyway.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.886
There's no good way
to shoot the party.

16:59.986 --> 17:00.920
Bye, kid.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.656
**

17:03.756 --> 17:04.691
Jimmy: "Dad"...

17:04.791 --> 17:07.527
U-N-- "unscrew
my board."

17:09.096 --> 17:11.064
Together:
Ray and Austin are chickens!

17:11.164 --> 17:13.066
Ray and Austin are chickens!

17:13.166 --> 17:14.101
Ray:
Oh, I'm a chicken?

17:14.201 --> 17:15.902
(children chanting "Chicken!")
So I provide 35%

17:16.002 --> 17:17.770
of the protein
America consumes?

17:17.870 --> 17:19.706
Real good insult.

17:19.806 --> 17:20.807
Hey! All right.
All right. All right.

17:20.907 --> 17:24.010
We've had our fun.
Help me find that snake.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.978
Let's go.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.014
My dad would've
found it already.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.517
He kills snakes
all the time.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.918
My dad
invented Pokémon.

17:32.018 --> 17:36.656
Oh, really?
Your dad is Satoshi Tajiri?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.691
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.093
(snake hissing)

17:40.193 --> 17:41.994
**

17:42.095 --> 17:43.029
Ray?

17:43.130 --> 17:45.498
**

17:45.598 --> 17:46.566
Dear God!

17:46.666 --> 17:48.568
What kind of snake
highway's up there?!

17:48.668 --> 17:49.669
(thud)
(both scream)

17:49.769 --> 17:51.204
(hissing continues)

17:51.304 --> 17:53.640
Okay,
you got this, Ray.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.841
You g-- You got this.

17:54.941 --> 17:55.875
All right.

17:55.975 --> 18:00.647
**

18:00.747 --> 18:02.815
Yes!

18:02.915 --> 18:05.685
Oh, no venom glands.
It's harmless.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.320
I'm gonna go show everyone
I caught it.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.923
And I'm never gonna
show my face again.

18:11.023 --> 18:14.427
**

18:14.527 --> 18:16.496
(indistinct conversations)

18:16.596 --> 18:18.331
You ready?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.167
And action!

18:20.267 --> 18:23.236
* She's a straight-talkin',
street-walkin' girl *

18:23.336 --> 18:26.239
(crowd cheering)

18:26.339 --> 18:32.212
**

18:32.312 --> 18:38.151
**

18:38.251 --> 18:43.856
**

18:43.956 --> 18:47.327
Oh, your nose
looks cold.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.861
And cut!

18:48.961 --> 18:50.363
We got it!

18:50.463 --> 18:51.498
(cheers and applause)

18:51.598 --> 18:54.201
Awesome.
(laughs)

18:54.301 --> 18:55.368
Gosh! Look
at that smile.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.536
Never seen you
so happy.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.072
"I've never been
so happy."

19:00.173 --> 19:02.642
Hmm. And how much of that would
you say is breast-related?

19:02.742 --> 19:05.912
"Five"...P-E-- "percent."

19:06.012 --> 19:07.747
"Per breast."
Well...

19:07.847 --> 19:09.416
That's a lot
left for movies.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.050
Am I detecting
a passion?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.486
**

19:13.586 --> 19:16.923
"I'm"...S-O-- "sorry
I lied.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.025
But thank you."

19:19.125 --> 19:22.195
Oh, it's all right.
It's exciting, isn't it?

19:22.295 --> 19:25.064
Now, do I have to have seen
"Bikini University" 1 and 2

19:25.164 --> 19:27.734
in order to understand your role
in "Bikini University 3"?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.237
Come on out, snake.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.504
(indistinct conversations)

19:31.604 --> 19:33.139
(gasps)

19:33.240 --> 19:34.507
No way!

19:34.607 --> 19:36.309
(children gasp)

19:36.409 --> 19:37.377
Austin
found the snake!

19:38.578 --> 19:40.980
Yeah, it tried eating us both,
but Austin wasn't scared.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.014
Right, Austin?

19:42.114 --> 19:44.851
Yeah.
I made this snake my "B."

19:44.951 --> 19:47.554
All: Whoa!

19:47.654 --> 19:50.257
Ray pooped his pants.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.224
(laughter)

19:51.324 --> 19:53.860
Really, man?
You had the win.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.663
(scattered "goodbyes")

19:56.763 --> 19:58.598
Justin Chang's
older brother!

19:58.698 --> 19:59.666
Dustin:
Heard what you did.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.733
Catching a snake

20:00.833 --> 20:02.535
but letting Austin Chang
take credit?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.737
That's huge.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.306
Come on, little bro.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.175
Dustin Chang
rates you...

20:09.276 --> 20:10.377
one to watch.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.813
**

20:13.913 --> 20:15.982
Dude, you had
a pretty good day.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.083
(laughs)

20:17.183 --> 20:19.586
But not as good
as Dustin Chang's.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.355
Dude is straight making out
with one of the moms.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.758
**

20:25.858 --> 20:27.494
(sighs) It's all
happening so fast.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.829
It was just yesterday
I was bringing my baby home.

20:29.929 --> 20:33.165
Now my baby's going to college?
Babies can't go to college.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.901
It's gonna be such a big change
for him.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.003
It's exciting.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.572
Look at him back there.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.841
Our little director.

20:41.941 --> 20:45.044
Dreaming of
cameras and shots.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.350
Yeah, that's what
he's burying his face in --

20:50.450 --> 20:52.552
a giant pair of cameras.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.390
Hey, Dylan,
your friend's here.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.925
It's time to get
that hideous thing

20:59.025 --> 21:00.760
out of this house,
once and for all.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.829
Please? He only escaped
because he was hungry.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.564
Now I know
snakes need food.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.232
Say goodbye, Dylan.
(sternly) Now.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.200
(sighs)

21:08.301 --> 21:09.201
You were a good snake.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.571
But it's for the best.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.374
Most of the fun was you
being a secret, anyway.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.408
Goodbye.

21:15.508 --> 21:20.347
**

21:20.447 --> 21:22.815
Hmm.
Fair trade. Deal.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.817
See the one
that just left?

21:24.917 --> 21:27.754
That's what happens to snakes
who don't stay secret.
