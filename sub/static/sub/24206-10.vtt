Where the fuck is he, man?
People are driving me nuts!

00:16.516 --> 00:18.893
Chill the fuck out.
I'm trying to talk to the camera here.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.228
Fucking talk, then.

00:20.645 --> 00:21.938
Well, today's a big day.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.940
We're making this announcement
that's gonna fucking

00:24.023 --> 00:26.568
change the lives of everybody here
in Sunnyvale.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.653
You know,
Sunnyvale's our home.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.905
We care about each
and every one of these people.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.116
How much longer
do we have to wait, for fuck's sake?

00:33.199 --> 00:35.577
Murray, shut the fuck up
or go the fuck home! All right?

00:35.660 --> 00:37.162
We're doing this for you,
for fuck's sake!

00:37.245 --> 00:38.580
-Fuck you!
-Fuck me?

00:38.663 --> 00:41.041
-[arguing]
-[horn honking]

00:42.459 --> 00:44.294
[honking]

00:45.086 --> 00:47.088
Fuck... Holy shit, Bubs!

00:47.672 --> 00:49.340
What the fuck is this?

00:49.424 --> 00:51.634
[Bubbles] Check that out.
[giggle]

00:51.718 --> 00:53.636
[Ricky] Fucking silver space ship.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.555
-[Bubbles] Fucking right.
-Look at that, man.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.515
[Bubbles giggling]
It looks like a spaceship.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.392
-Check it out.
-Fuck.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.769
Check it out, boys.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.271
[whispering] Julian, you didn't make
the announcement without me, did you?

01:03.354 --> 01:05.690
We wouldn't do that without you, man.
Here, you do the honours.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.192
What's the big fucking announcement?

01:07.275 --> 01:09.736
Bobby, I swear to fuck,
you say one more fucking word.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.404
-Ricky!
-Say one more fucking word!

01:11.488 --> 01:13.782
Ricky, it's all right. It's all right.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.493
Hey, everybody!
Sorry for the wait.

01:16.576 --> 01:20.205
Look. I know you all know
I started this little beer company

01:20.288 --> 01:23.500
a few months back because you guys
all kept me in business.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.084
So I wanna thank you for that.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.753
-[laugh]
-[mixed cheers]

01:26.836 --> 01:29.714
Well, Ricky and Julian
are my new partners

01:30.215 --> 01:33.301
and we are very happy
to announce that as of today,

01:33.551 --> 01:36.805
Freedom 35's gonna be available
right across Canada!

01:36.888 --> 01:38.223
[cheering]

01:38.306 --> 01:40.517
Yeah, and... and...

01:41.226 --> 01:43.937
you guys are all gonna be
a part of the new company.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.314
[cheering]

01:46.397 --> 01:47.941
Yes, sir.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.442
That's our way of, you know,

01:49.526 --> 01:51.486
giving something back to the park

01:51.569 --> 01:54.531
that's given so much
to us over the years.

01:54.989 --> 01:57.117
We care about everybody here.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.286
So anybody that needs a job,
you just fucking got one.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.248
-[cheering]
-And that goes for Lahey and Randy, too.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.749
[laughter]

02:05.208 --> 02:07.502
You know, it's been like
fucking Armageddon around here

02:07.585 --> 02:09.294
ever since I got out of jail

02:09.378 --> 02:12.048
but I think we really
turned a corner

02:12.132 --> 02:14.467
and I'm looking forward to a...

02:14.551 --> 02:17.720
a bright and wonderful
post-apocalypstic future.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.472
Okay, everybody,
thanks for coming out.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.683
I hope the surprise
was worth the wait.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.602
-Cheers.
-That wasn't the whole surprise.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.064
Actually, Julian, the old Bubbler
has a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.232
No way.

02:29.315 --> 02:32.110
Not actually, Ricky.
Not my real sleeve.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.988
Everybody,
today we are having...

02:35.697 --> 02:38.533
the fucking... double stag party

02:38.616 --> 02:40.451
to end all double stag parties!

02:40.535 --> 02:42.287
-No fucking way!
-[cheering]

02:42.370 --> 02:45.456
We've got more fucking beer
than you can shake a stick at.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.083
We've got food, we've got weed.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.294
All the fellas are invited.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.379
[cheering]

02:51.462 --> 02:53.590
Today's for getting
fucked up, everybody.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.967
-What are we gonna get?
-[all] Fucked up!

02:56.050 --> 02:58.177
I can't hear you!
What are we gonna get?

02:58.261 --> 02:59.888
Fucked up!

02:59.971 --> 03:02.974
[theme music]

03:42.013 --> 03:44.557
When people get married, they do
have a stag. That is normal, right?

03:44.641 --> 03:47.852
-I know, I know, but sometimes girls...
-Hey boys, get the fuck in here.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.812
It's time for
surprise number one.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.648
Get ready to be freaked out.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.360
[laughing]

03:57.820 --> 03:59.906
What do you got
going on here, Bubs?

03:59.989 --> 04:02.158
What is this, fucking Dexter's
kill room or something?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.786
[Bubbles] No, no. Just come in.
Come in.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.829
[Ricky] What the fuck's
happening, man?

04:06.913 --> 04:11.167
Well, my two best friends
are all grown up,

04:11.251 --> 04:13.336
and getting married
and everything,

04:13.419 --> 04:16.380
and it just got me thinking about,
you know, when we were kids

04:16.464 --> 04:18.882
and how much shit
we used to get into.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.885
So, boys, I went around the park

04:20.969 --> 04:23.763
and I was asking people
if they had any old footage of us.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.974
Mrs. Peterson had this in her shed.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.226
-[Julian] Oh, no.
-Yes. Are you ready for this?

04:28.309 --> 04:30.645
-[Ricky] Yes.
-[Bubbles giggling] Watch this.

04:30.728 --> 04:31.854
[whirring]

04:31.938 --> 04:35.024
[Ricky laughing]
I remember that hash!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.609
[Bubbles] Hot knives!

04:36.693 --> 04:38.319
-[Ricky] Right on!
-[laughter]

04:38.403 --> 04:39.779
That is awesome.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.031
[Bubbles] Ha-hah!
Doin' blades!

04:42.115 --> 04:43.866
Oh yeah, check this, boys.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.952
[Julian] Holy shit, isn't that
Lahey's old place?

04:46.035 --> 04:48.037
[Ricky] No way, is this the day? No!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.914
[Bubbles] This is it, Ricky.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.916
This is it, this is the day.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.459
[laughter]

04:53.543 --> 04:54.711
Can't believe it.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.629
[laughter]

04:56.713 --> 04:58.006
[Bubbles] Right in the bird!

04:58.923 --> 05:01.926
Remember? You got him, Ricky.
Remember? Went right in his pee hole.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.511
Sorry, bud.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.307
[Ricky] Fuck's happening here?

05:07.390 --> 05:08.808
[Bubbles] You guys remember this day?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.435
-Oh!
-Uh-oh!

05:10.518 --> 05:12.395
[Bubbles] Remember
how drunk he was?

05:12.478 --> 05:15.273
-...six hours.
-[laughter]

05:17.108 --> 05:19.694
[Bubbles] Look at Barb! Look at Barb!
[giggle]

05:22.071 --> 05:24.073
That was one of the best...

05:24.157 --> 05:26.534
one of the best space
sessions we ever had.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.414
[exclamations from the crowd]

05:34.625 --> 05:36.502
[Julian] We were young.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.256
-Had to start sometime.
-Oh, you used to be so cute!

05:40.339 --> 05:42.884
[Bubbles] I think that's the first time
I ever drank liquor.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.224
Uh-oh.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.727
-What were you, 12?
-We were young, we were young.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.563
[Bubbles] I think that car's still
at the bottom of the lake.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.190
[laughter]

05:59.650 --> 06:01.903
-[applause]
-Yeah!

06:01.986 --> 06:03.613
Bubs, get over here, man.
That was awesome.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.281
-Give me a hug.
-Yes.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.034
That was the coolest fucking thing
I've ever seen in my life, man!

06:08.117 --> 06:11.037
Bring it in, Bubs.
That was badass, buddy! Thanks.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.289
-Right on.
-Congratulations, boys.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.666
Okay, you guys ready
to go get fucked up or what?

06:15.750 --> 06:17.919
-[various] Yes!
[Bubbles and Julian] Let's do it!

06:18.002 --> 06:19.629
[Ricky] Gotta stop by my trailer
for a minute.

06:20.379 --> 06:21.756
[Julian] All right, let's go.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.634
[bottles clinking]

06:25.301 --> 06:28.596
Hey T, can you get all the boys down
to the gravel pit? I'll meet you there.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.807
-I got you, B.
-All right.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.809
So I don't want you worrying
about me today, okay?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.519
I promise I won't get too fucked up.

06:34.602 --> 06:38.189
What? No, I want you to get fucked up.
It's your stag party, babe.

06:38.272 --> 06:41.109
-You for real?
-Yes! I mean, don't get, you know,

06:41.192 --> 06:43.528
bang-a-stripper messed up,
but have fun.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.822
Baby, I don't want to be banging
any strippers, believe me.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.824
-Exactly.
-Strippers?

06:48.407 --> 06:50.535
Baby, I don't want you
around any strippers.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.204
What the fuck you talking about?
Of course there's going to be strippers.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.123
It's a stag party.
STAG: Strippers That Are Greasy.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.833
There's going to be strippers.
Right, Bubs?

06:56.916 --> 06:59.335
What? I... don't know that for sure.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.546
It's not a big deal.
We're just gonna look at them.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.631
It's not like we're gonna
fucking tee off on them

07:03.714 --> 07:05.967
-or finger blast them or anything.
-What does that even mean?

07:06.050 --> 07:09.011
Get some shit going. Not gonna do it.
We're just gonna look at them.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.638
I don't care if you
look at male strippers.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.348
-Good. Maybe we will.
-Perfect!

07:12.432 --> 07:15.768
Yeah. If you lay a finger
on them, I swear to God...

07:15.852 --> 07:17.061
Don't do it, Ricky.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.939
I hear you.
Don't grab any fucking cocks.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.691
Okay. Well, if you touch any strippers,

07:21.774 --> 07:23.776
you come home,
I'm gonna have a cock in each pocket.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.778
Why would you even say that?
I didn't say, "Hey,

07:25.862 --> 07:27.780
gonna get a bag
full of tits and come home...

07:27.864 --> 07:30.032
If you come home with a fucking bag
full of tits...

07:30.116 --> 07:31.826
-I'm not going to, Susan!
-...the stupidest thing.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.454
-Fuck! Love you.
-Love you too, baby.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.582
-Have fun.
-You too.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.917
Prepare for some drunken banging
when I get back, all right?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.544
-Okay, baby.
-All right. I love you, babe.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.837
Have fun.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.298
[Julian] All right, boys.
Let's do it!

07:45.381 --> 07:48.718
Holy fuck, this thing is badass, man!
Is this real wood?

07:48.801 --> 07:50.595
[Bubbles] Oh, you're fucking right,
it's real wood, Ricky.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.597
It's all mahogany, I think.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.475
A smoke eater, too.
That's awesome, for smoking the dope.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.394
A fucking flat screen TV!
Are you kidding me, buddy?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.271
Ricky, it's got a satellite dish too.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.899
-I got all the fucking channels.
-Fuck off!

08:02.982 --> 08:05.026
There's a Rambo marathon
on tonight, boys.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.445
Maybe we could watch that
when we're all fucked up later.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.989
Yeah, no. Yeah, we could,
or maybe we'll do some other shit.

08:10.072 --> 08:13.159
We'll see what happens. I just can't
believe you own this fucking thing.

08:13.242 --> 08:17.121
Well, I technically do, Ricky,
and I'll probably end up living in it.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.500
But, I mean, I feel like we all own it,
you know?

08:20.583 --> 08:23.586
Yeah, but we don't. You own it, right?
You just said that.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.923
Well, we could all
have one very soon, Ricky.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.425
I mean, you know,
the beer guy said

08:29.509 --> 08:31.344
if everything goes
the way it should,

08:31.719 --> 08:34.013
we're going to make 90 grand
this year possibly.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.264
-What?
-Think about that.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.058
-You shut the fuck up!
-That's 30 grand each.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.392
-What?
-[Julian] Holy fuck!

08:38.476 --> 08:40.144
-[laugh]
-Set for life!

08:40.352 --> 08:43.438
Bubs, where you going? You just passed
the fucking road to the pit.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.900
No, we got one more stop
to make first, Julian.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.652
[giggle]

08:48.277 --> 08:52.156
So I said, you can't had herpes.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.116
[laughter]

08:55.660 --> 08:58.162
Sarah, I'm so sorry for how I acted.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.082
I mean, I'm sure it must be difficult
for you to accept

09:01.165 --> 09:04.043
that Ricky and I are getting married
but I feel like we're all adults.

09:04.126 --> 09:07.463
Okay, wait. You think that I'm upset
that you're marrying Ricky?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.423
[laughing]
I couldn't be happier.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.425
I can't believe anybody
would marry him.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.302
What the fuck do you mean by that?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.930
Well, like I've slept with him
a couple times over the years.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.808
Like, you know, he's really good
in bed, okay?

09:18.891 --> 09:21.102
But I wouldn't marry him
in a million years.

09:21.185 --> 09:24.855
Well, he may be good in bed
but he is one shitty handyman. Ugh.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.358
[Sarah] Yeah, he's a total fuck-up.
No offence, Trin.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.359
None taken.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.485
Mm.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.113
He is great in bed. I don't think
anybody's disputing that.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.907
Oh my God, guys!
It's my dad.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.742
Has anyone not slept with him?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.912
-Seriously, anybody?
-I haven't. Hello?

09:39.996 --> 09:42.331
-Well, I'm not saying anything.
-[laughing]

09:42.415 --> 09:45.293
Yes, sir. I can be there in, uh,
15 minutes.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.421
-Sorry, ladies. Duty calls.
-[several] Awww!

09:48.504 --> 09:50.464
Yeah, there's a really big case
I've been working on

09:50.548 --> 09:52.758
for the past several months.
An international drug case.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.345
-Ooh, that sounds exciting.
-One step closer to being a judge.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.514
[mixed laughs, cheers]

09:59.265 --> 10:01.684
-Cheers to dicks.
-[laughter]

10:03.894 --> 10:05.771
Have fun. Don't do
anything I wouldn't do.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.481
-Bye!
-We won't.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.610
-[door banging]
-[Bubbles] Ricky...

10:12.111 --> 10:13.779
Grab a seat, boys.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.158
What the fuck are we doing here?
Isn't there food at the pit?

10:17.241 --> 10:19.285
Yeah, there's food at the pit.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.245
I just wanted to come here

10:21.329 --> 10:23.831
and I thought it was the perfect place
to make a toast.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.750
All right.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.879
[giggling]
You guys don't even realize

10:29.962 --> 10:31.631
where we are, do you?

10:31.964 --> 10:33.924
-We're at the fucking school.
-Yeah, why are we here?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.885
We should be at the fucking pit
getting fucked.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.847
Boys, this is where
we were sitting

10:40.723 --> 10:44.268
the first time you ever mentioned
the words "Freedom 35", Julian.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.938
Holy fuck, the memory on you.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.316
Yeah, that's the day
you picked us up at jail.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.734
-Yes, sir.
-Wow, man.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.195
Oh, my fuck! And then we went
to steal car stereos.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.697
-Yes, we did.
-Are we gonna steal car stereos?

10:56.781 --> 10:59.700
No, Ricky, no.
I just wanted to come here

10:59.784 --> 11:01.661
and just, you know, make a toast,

11:02.119 --> 11:04.747
-because I love you guys.
-We love you too, man.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.082
You're fucking right we do.

11:06.374 --> 11:09.001
-Wow.
-To friends, family,

11:09.085 --> 11:11.462
and to my best friends
getting married.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.797
And to never giving up.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.091
And to ever never going back to jail.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.511
We did it, boys.
To Freedom 35.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.262
To Freedom 35.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.601
-Let's just take it in.
-[Julian] Ahh.

11:25.684 --> 11:29.021
Okay. Well, now we got that
out of the way.

11:29.105 --> 11:32.066
Let's go to the pit and get fuckin'
fucked out of our fuckin' minds!

11:32.149 --> 11:33.776
Let's do it! Let's go.
Come on, boys.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.445
-[Julian] Let's go, Bubs.
-[Ricky] Come on, buddy. Whoo!

11:36.529 --> 11:41.117
I thought we could sit here for a minute
and enjoy the sentimentality of it.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.162
Fuck! Look at all this shit, man.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.956
-This is fucking amazing!
-[Bubbles laughing]

11:47.039 --> 11:49.917
Boys, I want you guys
to have the best day

11:50.000 --> 11:52.211
you've ever had
in your entire fucking lives.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.839
Look at all the people.
And what the fuck's with these cars, Bubs?

11:54.922 --> 11:56.841
They're not for what
I think they are, are they?

11:56.924 --> 11:58.426
[Bubbles] Oh, you're fucking
right they are, Ricky.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.845
-[Ricky] Oh, yeah!
-We're having a smash-up derby

12:00.928 --> 12:03.848
and once they're fucking sufficiently
immobilized, guess what?

12:03.931 --> 12:04.849
-What?
-[Bubbles giggling]

12:04.932 --> 12:07.017
We're going to shoot them
with machine guns

12:07.101 --> 12:09.061
and then blow them up
with fucking dynamite!

12:09.145 --> 12:10.646
-[Ricky] No, we're fucking not!
-[Julian] What?

12:10.729 --> 12:12.565
I got everything from Reggie, baby.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.483
[Ricky] Bubbles!
You are fucking awesome!

12:14.567 --> 12:16.944
-Everything from Reggie.
-[laughter]

12:17.278 --> 12:19.947
Man, this is gonna be
fucking incredible!

12:20.364 --> 12:22.658
Let's fucking get
some drinking going, boys!

12:22.741 --> 12:24.952
-[giggle]
-[cheering]

12:25.619 --> 12:28.956
[Bubbles] Everybody,
let's get this party started!

12:29.039 --> 12:30.958
-[mixed cheers]
-Just wait... Pam.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.085
What the fuck are you doing? Grill...

12:33.169 --> 12:35.171
You can't cook a burger
to save your fucking life!

12:35.254 --> 12:37.923
Randy, get on the cheeseburger
detail, bud.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.633
-Okay, Bubbles.
-Mr. Lahey,

12:39.717 --> 12:41.886
get the liquor flowing, will you?
Come on.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.387
Cory, Jacob,

12:43.471 --> 12:45.514
there's about a hundred
cases of beer on there.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.516
You guys hump 'em off there, please.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.435
Cool, man. I got one already.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.353
Well, just go get the fucking cases.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.273
You take off the hundred
and you can have a six pack between yous.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.399
Dope.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.695
Hey, everybody, without further ado,
I'd like to hand over the floor

12:59.778 --> 13:02.156
to the master of grease ceremonies...

13:02.239 --> 13:03.741
-[cheering]
-Do it, T!

13:03.824 --> 13:07.745
Yes, man. Y'all make some noise
for my mans, Ricky and Julian, y'all!

13:07.828 --> 13:09.538
-Right on, T!
-[cheering]

13:09.622 --> 13:11.373
-All right.
-Look at the size of that...

13:11.457 --> 13:13.792
-...this little bitch into my lungs.
-[giggle]

13:15.669 --> 13:17.129
-How's it going?
-[Bubbles] Here we go.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.132
I'm not allowed to touch you today
but I'm allowed to look at you.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.511
-I am! I am!
-[Julian] Right on!

13:23.594 --> 13:25.846
I'm pretty fucking impressed
with what Bubble's pulled together

13:25.930 --> 13:27.765
for this stag party.
It's fucking incredible.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.433
We've got ladies,
fucking food with the burgers,

13:29.517 --> 13:31.852
cars to fucking smash up
and then blow up and shoot,

13:31.936 --> 13:33.437
guns, kablammo powder...

13:33.521 --> 13:36.273
This could be the best stag party
in the history of the fucking world.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.151
The only thing that might make it better
would be a fucking magic unicorn

13:39.235 --> 13:42.446
shitting golden nickels on us
from a rainbow. Maybe.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.157
[Bubbles] Boys, drive some more
burgers into you.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.825
There's tons of food.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.577
Get some more food.
Keep cooking, Randy.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.497
Boys, are you ready to get the fucking
smash-up derby going or what?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.249
-You're goddamn right!
-Let's fucking do it, man!

13:53.332 --> 13:55.626
I mean, I don't want
to break up the par-tay here.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.545
It's okay, we'll be back.
We'll be back, ladies.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.756
Okay. Boys, you ready
to get the smash-up derby going?

14:00.839 --> 14:02.675
-Yeah!
-Do we get a car, Bubbles?

14:02.758 --> 14:05.928
You're goddamn right you get a car.
Lahey, you're fucking driving.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.389
All right!

14:08.472 --> 14:10.724
[Bubbles] Okay. Everybody get
your fucking helmets on.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.351
Safety first!

14:12.434 --> 14:14.395
[Lahey] Gentlemen,
start your engines!

14:14.478 --> 14:17.398
-Helmets on, Ricky.
-I'm not wearing a fucking helmet.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.401
-Yes, you are wearing a fucking--
-It'll fuck up my hair.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.779
Ricky, would you rather have
fucked-up hair or a fucked-up brain?

14:24.780 --> 14:28.158
Okay, boys, climb in.
Let's get this fucking thing going!

14:28.659 --> 14:30.536
Yo, dude, our doors are locked.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.122
[Bubbles] It's fucking
chained shut, Cory.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.957
You've got to go in
through the window.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.209
[engines starting]

14:39.712 --> 14:42.256
[whooping, cheering]

14:42.339 --> 14:45.009
[rock music]

14:45.759 --> 14:48.220
[Bubbles grunting with excitement]

14:50.556 --> 14:52.308
Ahh! Look out, Mr. Lahey!

14:52.558 --> 14:54.685
[Julian] Holy fuck this is awesome!

14:54.768 --> 14:57.104
I'm coming to get you, Lahey!

15:04.403 --> 15:06.322
[Jacob] Aw, dude, man, Cory, look out!

15:08.365 --> 15:11.118
[Ricky] Yeah! Fuck you,
Lahey and Randy! Whoo!

15:11.744 --> 15:14.330
All right, who the fuck else
wants a piece of me?

15:16.624 --> 15:18.417
[Julian] Eat my ass, Lahey!

15:20.586 --> 15:22.338
[motor revving]

15:22.421 --> 15:26.008
-[Ricky] All right, come on, Bubbles!
-[Bubbles] No, Ricky! Not head-on!

15:26.091 --> 15:27.801
[Ricky] Fuck off, man.
You can't get hurt!

15:27.885 --> 15:29.345
[Bubbles] Yes, you can!

15:29.845 --> 15:31.055
[cheering]

15:31.430 --> 15:33.849
[Ricky] Oh, you think so, do you,
you little fuckers?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.143
-Boom!
-[Bubbles] Fuck's sake, Rick!

15:36.226 --> 15:37.519
[cheering]

15:38.520 --> 15:40.356
[Julian] Fuck, Ricky, watch the...

15:42.274 --> 15:44.860
[Bubbles] Fatal mistake, Cory and Jacob.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.321
Here comes the Bubbinator!

15:47.404 --> 15:49.406
[screaming, grunting]

15:49.490 --> 15:51.659
-[engine sputtering]
-[Cory] Aw, dude. What's going on?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.285
Start the car, dude!

15:53.369 --> 15:55.704
[Ricky] Bubs, Julian,
they can't start their car.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.373
Malachi fuckin' Crunch!

15:58.165 --> 16:00.417
[Cory] Hey dude, what's
a Malachi Crunch, dude?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.586
[Ricky] Get the fuck out of my way!

16:03.003 --> 16:05.255
-[Julian] Just back the fuck up!
-[engine sputtering]

16:05.339 --> 16:07.383
[Bubbles]
Boys, not the Malachi Crunch!

16:08.092 --> 16:10.427
All right! Hit it! Do it!

16:10.511 --> 16:11.595
[Bubbles] Boys!

16:13.138 --> 16:15.641
-[Ricky] Boom!
-[crowd] Ohh-h-h!

16:15.724 --> 16:17.393
[laughter]

16:17.726 --> 16:20.354
[Ricky] Whoo! Right on, Julian.
That was fucking perfect.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.524
[Jacob moaning]
Shit, dude. I can't believe...

16:23.607 --> 16:26.110
Oh, man what's wrong, dude? You okay?

16:26.193 --> 16:28.946
I think so. I think I might have
broke this thing again, though.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.323
-Broke what thing? Your neck?
-I think so.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.534
Jacob, stop being a pussy.
You can't break your neck twice

16:33.617 --> 16:35.995
-in the same place. It's impossible.
-No, it's not, Ricky.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.998
-You can totally do that.
-Well, can you walk?

16:39.206 --> 16:40.916
I think so.
[panting]

16:41.000 --> 16:44.545
All right. Cory, drag him the fuck out of
there. Go lay down in the RV and relax.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.381
You're not ruining a perfect fucking day
with a goddamn broken neck, Jacob.

16:47.464 --> 16:51.218
Well, just be careful with him.
These cars are about as fucked up

16:51.301 --> 16:53.012
as they're going to get
from driving them.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.805
What do you say
we shoot these cocksuckers

16:54.888 --> 16:56.598
-and then blow them up?
-Fuck, yeah!

16:56.682 --> 16:57.516
[cheering]

16:57.599 --> 16:59.727
All right, I'll get my homemade
kablammo powder!

16:59.810 --> 17:02.396
-[cellphone ringing]
-Right on, Bubs. Best day ever, buddy!

17:02.479 --> 17:05.482
Hi, baby. What?
Slow down.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.902
What... why is it off?

17:10.988 --> 17:12.990
Japanese mafia?
What are you...?

17:13.240 --> 17:14.742
No, listen to me.
Listen to me.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.161
No, no, babe, babe, let me...
Stop yelling.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.704
Ba... Candy?

17:19.788 --> 17:20.789
[click]

17:20.873 --> 17:23.375
[sigh]
For fuck's sakes! Fuck!

17:23.459 --> 17:25.627
[Ricky] What the fuck's
going on, man? Are you all right?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.253
No, I'm not all right!

17:27.503 --> 17:29.298
Candy just broke up with me.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.091
What? What the fuck did she say?

17:31.175 --> 17:32.968
I don't know, man.
She was screaming at me,

17:33.052 --> 17:36.388
calling me a liar and... something
about the fucking Japanese mafia.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.223
Told me to get a lawyer,
shit's coming down.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.975
I don't fucking know, man.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.061
It sucks but...

17:42.936 --> 17:45.981
-So, you're not getting married?
-Apparently not, Ricky.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.275
[laughing]
That's fucking amazing!

17:48.358 --> 17:49.443
-Fuck you!
-No, seriously.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.404
If you're not getting married,
I'm definitely not getting married!

17:52.488 --> 17:53.697
It's fucking perfect.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.200
-I gotta go fucking deal with this.
-No, no, no, no.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.202
-No, I'm dealing with this...
-This is an awesome day...

17:58.285 --> 18:00.788
-Get the fuck out of my way!
-It just got awesomer. Think about it.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.790
We're fucking single now.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.710
-I don't want to be single!
-Okay, well, trust me on this one.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.213
When they're fucking worked up,
yelling and screaming at you,

18:09.296 --> 18:10.631
you've got to let them calm down.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.633
It's happened to me,
and that's the best fucking thing.

18:12.716 --> 18:13.634
-Let them calm down.
-Yeah?

18:13.717 --> 18:14.927
Yeah.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.638
All right. Okay,
let's go blow some shit up.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.932
-Yes, let's go blow some shit up!
-Deal with this later.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.100
[Ricky] Whoo!

18:21.642 --> 18:23.769
[Jacob panting]
Thank you.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.314
[Randy] Holy frig, your neck
is crooked, Jacob.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.941
[panting]

18:30.067 --> 18:31.652
Thank you.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.612
[Ricky] Holy fuck,
these are amazing, Bubs!

18:33.695 --> 18:37.574
-Where did you get these fucking things?
-Fucking Reggie just got 'em in. Ricky.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.660
[laugh]
All right, boys.

18:39.743 --> 18:42.788
Listen, that's fucking
full of kablammo powder.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.707
The first one to hit the sweet spot,
that baby's going up.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.459
-Right on. I'm hitting it.
-You guys ready?

18:47.543 --> 18:48.669
-Yeah!
-Do it.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.338
All right. One, two, three, fire!

18:51.421 --> 18:53.841
[gunfire]

19:00.639 --> 19:02.683
[crowd cheering]

19:02.766 --> 19:04.268
[Bubbles] Yeah!

19:04.351 --> 19:06.270
Holy fuck!

19:06.353 --> 19:09.273
That was fucking incredible, man!
Let's do another one.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.066
You want me to wire up
another one, Ricky?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.067
Yeah!

19:12.151 --> 19:14.069
-Let's do it!
-Wait, wait, wait... what's that?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.487
What?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.281
-[sirens in the distance]
-Is that sirens?

19:17.364 --> 19:19.074
Yeah. They sound like they're far away,
though.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.200
Let's go. Let's go.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.995
Let's go. Come on. In the RV.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.873
-[Ricky] Come on, buddy.
-[Lahey] Hey, Julian.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.041
Jacob's really not feeling very well,
boys. He's going...

19:28.125 --> 19:29.793
Get the fuck in!
Get the fuck in!

19:29.877 --> 19:31.670
-Everybody in.
-What are we doing?

19:31.753 --> 19:33.380
-[Ricky] We're not taking them.
-[Julian] Get in!

19:33.463 --> 19:35.174
-[Ricky] Fuck!
-[Julian] Let's go!

19:35.257 --> 19:38.260
-[Bubbles] Let's blow up another one!
-[Julian] Get the fuck in here, Bubbles!

19:38.343 --> 19:40.637
Julian, what the fuck
is going on here?

19:40.721 --> 19:42.681
I don't know. Just give me
a second to think.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.433
Well, why are we fucking leaving?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.476
Like, we didn't really do
anything wrong.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.729
And is this cop...
What's this? Is this here for us?

19:48.812 --> 19:50.189
Holy fuck.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.524
-Julian?
-What?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.693
Bubs, just give me
a fucking second here!

19:54.776 --> 19:56.653
Am I fucking driving
or are we pulling over?

19:56.737 --> 19:58.363
-What is happening?
-Keep fucking driving.

19:58.447 --> 20:02.034
-Where the fuck am I going?
-Ricky, just pull over.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.953
No. Keep driving
until I fucking sort this out.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.831
[Bubbles] What do you mean sort it out?
Sort what out?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.459
All right. Candy called me earlier.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.336
She said it was fucking...
something about me

20:12.419 --> 20:14.671
being involved with
the Japanese mafia or something.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.090
I think it has something to do
with the mushroom deal.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.218
Oh, do you fucking think, Einstein?

20:19.301 --> 20:21.511
-And there's fucking more cops coming?
-[sirens blaring]

20:21.595 --> 20:23.180
You didn't think to mention this?

20:23.263 --> 20:25.557
Look at them,
they're fucking coming in hot.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.768
-Fuck!
-Pull this the fuck over right now, Ricky!

20:27.851 --> 20:29.144
I'm not fucking pulling over now.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.979
It's three fucking cop cars, Bubs.
You know what?

20:31.063 --> 20:33.565
We can outrun them.
We got the perfect buzz on for this.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.609
Ricky, we cannot outrun
fucking three cops

20:35.692 --> 20:37.611
-in this old fucking piece of shit!
-Yes, we can.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.988
We just need to make it to Moncton,
cross the fucking border

20:40.072 --> 20:42.366
and we'll hide out in Moncton.
They can't fucking touch us there.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.785
Oh, we're making a run
for the county line, are we, Ricky?

20:44.868 --> 20:47.829
This isn't fucking Porky's!
Pull the fucking thing over.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.415
-Bubs, I can fucking outrun them.
-[Julian] Just punch it.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.251
-[engine roaring]
-Ricky!

20:52.334 --> 20:56.505
So I said to him, "I don't think
that's gonna fit in there."

20:56.588 --> 20:58.131
-[breaking news music on TV]
-[laughter]

20:58.215 --> 21:00.467
[Sarah] Holy fucking shit! Trinity!

21:00.759 --> 21:03.178
[Steve Rogers] Police are now
in pursuit of four suspects

21:03.262 --> 21:07.057
believed to be involved in the drug bust
in Halifax Pier yesterday

21:07.140 --> 21:10.602
involving psilocybin mushrooms
en route to Japan.

21:12.729 --> 21:16.275
Hey, I think we lost them, boys.
Good driving, Rickles.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.736
Well, hopefully they just fucking
pulled back for safety reasons.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.239
Watch the bumps, eh, boys.
I'm really hurting down here.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.032
-[Cory] Here dude.
-[Ricky] Are you okay, Jacob?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.575
-The fuck is that?
-[helicopter whirring]

21:25.659 --> 21:28.120
[Bubbles] Jesus fuck! There's a Channel 10
news chopper!

21:28.203 --> 21:30.289
How? I thought we fucking shot it down
with your rocket.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.249
-You did?
-Oh, my fuck, no,

21:32.332 --> 21:34.293
-they must have got a new one.
-[Ricky] What?

21:34.376 --> 21:37.004
-It is nice!
-[Julian] Ricky! Rick-Rick-Rick...

21:37.087 --> 21:39.047
-[clattering]
-[mixed shouting]

21:39.131 --> 21:40.424
[Bubbles] Holy fuck, Ricky!

21:40.507 --> 21:41.717
[Jacob moaning]

21:42.217 --> 21:43.593
[Bubbles] Ricky!

21:43.677 --> 21:45.637
[Julian] That way, that way, that way!

21:45.721 --> 21:48.432
Dead end up here.
Dead end! Take a... Do a U-ey!

21:48.515 --> 21:50.892
-Where am I going? Where?
-[Julian] Just do a fucking U-ey!

21:50.976 --> 21:53.061
[Bubbles] Ricky, what in the fuck
are you doing?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.855
[various] Right! Right! Right! Ricky!

21:54.938 --> 21:57.024
-[crashing]
-[Jacob groaning, moaning]

21:57.107 --> 21:59.359
[Julian] Over this way!
Over this way! Back on the path!

21:59.943 --> 22:01.403
Ricky!

22:01.486 --> 22:03.447
[Bubbles] Ricky, you hit
every fucking thing in the park!

22:03.530 --> 22:06.450
What the fuck did they do? Put all this
shit right in the fucking middle?

22:06.533 --> 22:08.660
-Oh fuck! Cop, cop!
-[Bubbles whimpering]

22:08.744 --> 22:10.662
-Oh, we're fucked, boys!
-[officer] Stop the vehicle! Stop!

22:10.746 --> 22:12.831
-[Julian] Just pull over.
-[Ricky] How you doing?

22:12.914 --> 22:14.624
[officer] Pull that fucking thing over!

22:15.667 --> 22:18.795
[Steve Rogers] A dramatic chase unfolding
that Steve Rogers will continue

22:18.879 --> 22:23.800
to report on despite a crippling fear
of being back in the news chopper

22:23.884 --> 22:26.428
after that horrendous crash
several weeks back.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.263
-Fuck!
-Those fucking idiots.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.515
-What a bunch of A-holes.
-Ugh.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.267
[Steve Rogers] New information
just coming in.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.478
The RV apparently belongs to Bubbles
of the Sunnyvale...

22:34.561 --> 22:36.354
[Bubbles] Oh my fuck, they named me!

22:36.438 --> 22:39.149
...in crime, Ricky and Julian,
are said to be on board as well.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.444
Police now saying that the drugs,
had they hit the streets of Japan,

22:42.527 --> 22:44.237
would have been worth well
over a million dollars.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.282
What? A million dollars? I knew that
fucking guy was fucking ripping us off!

22:47.365 --> 22:48.658
[Julian] Turn this shit off.

22:48.742 --> 22:52.037
[Bubbles] Ricky, just pull over, please.
Let's just face the fucking music.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.498
It's a little more complicated than
that, Bubs. Look, we're almost

22:54.581 --> 22:57.709
at the highway. It's pretty much
a straight shot to Moncton from there.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.337
Why are you still trying
to get to fucking Moncton?

23:00.420 --> 23:02.047
[on radio] Dispatch,
get this chopper out of here.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.924
-[Ricky] They still back there?
-[horns honking]

23:04.007 --> 23:07.385
Oh, yeah, we've got fucking people
cheering us on like fucking O.J. now?

23:07.469 --> 23:10.430
Thank fuck the traffic's not dreadlocked.
We'd be really fucked.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.725
We're almost at the fucking highway,
boys. We're gonna make it!

23:13.809 --> 23:15.977
[Bubbles] We're gonna make it,
are we, Ricky?

23:17.729 --> 23:20.732
Fuck. It's one of those circley things.
What the fuck do you do with these?

23:20.816 --> 23:22.818
Go, stay to the right,
go around it, Ricky!

23:22.901 --> 23:24.861
-The circle or...?
-Go around the circle.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.905
-[Jacob] Don't go too fast.
-[Cory] Dude man,

23:26.988 --> 23:28.949
if you go backwards
you could lose the chopper,

23:29.032 --> 23:30.992
'cause choppers don't go backwards.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.994
[helicopter whirring]

23:33.495 --> 23:35.956
[man on radio] Dispatch in pursuit
of a silver RV on Chipper Drive.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.959
-It's your fucking fault, Julian!
-Why is it my fault?

23:39.042 --> 23:41.336
-Why do I listen to you?
-We all agreed to do this.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.130
Stop fucking trying
to get around me!

23:43.213 --> 23:45.006
-Fuck off!
-[Lahey] Shit!

23:45.090 --> 23:46.091
[Bubbles] Ricky!

23:47.342 --> 23:50.345
Ricky! Get back
in the fucking vehicle, Ricky!

23:50.428 --> 23:53.056
[Julian] ...over this way.
He's gonna pass. Over this way.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.767
-[siren buzzing]
-[Bubbles] Jesus Murphy.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.311
[Julian] Roadblock. What the fuck
are we gonna do here?

23:58.395 --> 24:00.605
-Fuck's sakes...
-Correction. Half block.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.316
[laughs]
You fucking idiot!

24:03.400 --> 24:05.777
-[Bubbles] Ricky!
-[tires hissing]

24:05.861 --> 24:07.445
[shouting]

24:07.529 --> 24:08.530
Fuck's sakes!

24:08.613 --> 24:10.490
This fucking piece of shit
must have shitty tires!

24:10.574 --> 24:12.284
Every one of 'em just
fucking blew at once!

24:12.367 --> 24:14.744
Just pull over, Ricky.
We're on fucking rims.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.329
We can make it still!

24:16.413 --> 24:18.957
Ricky, you name one person on "Cops"
you ever saw make it

24:19.040 --> 24:20.542
on fucking rims.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.377
I don't know
their fucking names but...

24:22.460 --> 24:24.754
I've seen't them fucking do it! Fuck!

24:24.838 --> 24:26.089
-[Bubbles] Fuck.
-[Julian] Shit!

24:26.173 --> 24:28.175
[man on speaker] This is
the Sunnyvale Police Department.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.594
We have you surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.762
All right, everybody
calm the fuck down for a second here!

24:32.846 --> 24:35.807
Just give us a second.
I think I can get us out of this, boys.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.226
-Just fucking stay with me here.
-Oh, fuck.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.021
My name is J.P. Cormier.
I've got my son-of-law in here.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.273
He fucking pretty much snapped
his neck in fucking half!

24:43.356 --> 24:44.608
It's broken big time!

24:44.691 --> 24:47.027
I didn't know you guys
were following me till right now, okay?

24:47.110 --> 24:49.154
Coming out. Give us a second.
It's all good here.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.866
[man] Get out of the vehicle
with your hands up now!

24:52.949 --> 24:55.452
Our fucking whole lives
down the tubes!

24:55.535 --> 24:57.245
[Julian] Don't worry.
I'll take the heat for everything.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.955
Fuck... Don't worry about it, Bubs.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.041
Your life's not gonna change a bit,
believe me.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.336
Oh yeah? You don't think my life changes
if you go to jail?

25:04.419 --> 25:06.338
That's the part you guys
don't seem to understand.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.340
Let's just go out
and fucking deal with this.

25:08.423 --> 25:12.260
Maybe we'll just get a warning
if they don't have any fucking evidence.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.180
Get the fuck out of the way, Jacob.
This isn't all about you, okay?

25:15.263 --> 25:17.098
It's not quite that simple
unfortunately, buddy.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.809
-[groaning]
-[Bubbles] What are you talking about?

25:19.893 --> 25:21.478
-Fuck's sakes.
-Oh, my fucking fuck, Ricky!

25:21.561 --> 25:23.021
Are you out of your mind?

25:23.104 --> 25:24.856
Ricky, why didn't you fucking tell us
about those?

25:24.940 --> 25:27.609
Because I was saving it for an
end-of-the-night surprise, all right?

25:27.692 --> 25:29.486
I was gonna keep the party going
with them.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.404
Why didn't you tell us
when we were moving?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.031
We could have dumped
the fucking things.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.908
'Cause I thought
we were gonna get away.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.868
Wouldn't have anything
to celebrate with then!

25:36.952 --> 25:38.787
There must be fucking toilet.
Flush the fucking things.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.039
Ricky, we're in a fucking RV.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.375
You can't flush anything,
it'll just go in the tank.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.335
You know that
they could just fucking...

25:45.418 --> 25:46.920
they can put these
under a microscope

25:47.003 --> 25:49.047
and match them up
to the ones from the bust.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.924
We're fucked!
That's it, boys.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.760
Freedom 35 just turned
into Incarceration 100.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.679
Well, there's only
one thing left to do.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.472
We're gonna have
to eat the fucking things.

25:57.555 --> 26:00.100
Eat them? There's enough of those
fucking things to take down a moose!

26:00.183 --> 26:03.687
Yeah. There's a lot. There is.
But we could fucking do it.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.814
We can't eat them.
We'll die. We're fucked.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.774
No, we totally can, dude.
Back in the day,

26:07.857 --> 26:09.859
I ate like a ton,
a ton of 'shrooms.

26:09.943 --> 26:13.029
Yeah, did you ever think maybe that's
why you're fucked in the head, Cory?

26:13.113 --> 26:16.825
[man] It's over, boys.
Come out with your hands up.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.952
What are we gonna do, boys?

26:19.035 --> 26:22.122
Well, that depends on how bad
we want fucking Freedom 35 here.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.707
It's not just about us anymore.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.251
It's about the entire future
of everybody back at the park.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.128
-Well, I'm in.
-I'm in.

26:28.211 --> 26:29.838
[Jacob] Ah, man. I guess so.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.798
Mr. Lahey? We're in.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.384
[Julian] And I'm in.
What do you say, Bubs?

26:34.467 --> 26:35.510
Huh?

26:36.970 --> 26:39.347
Well, fuck it. I guess I'm in too.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.725
All right, we're coming out.
Just give us a couple of minutes.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.768
We're dealing with a fucking guy
with a broken neck

26:43.852 --> 26:46.438
and a guy with a fucked-up brain!
But we are coming out.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.150
-[Bubbles] To the future, boys.
-[Julian] Give me some.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.861
-Oh, my God!
-[Julian] Oh, my fuck.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.112
[Bubbles] Just eat 'em, boys.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.616
[Cory gagging]

26:59.075 --> 27:01.077
[Julian] These are
fucking disgusting!

27:01.161 --> 27:02.537
Ah, gross, dude!

27:02.620 --> 27:06.291
Boys, if you mash them into a ball,
they're not so bad.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.501
Make a little mushroom ball
and just pretend

27:08.585 --> 27:10.754
it's... a nice risotto or somethin'.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.008
Come on, Bubbles.
Come on, keep it together.

27:15.091 --> 27:17.510
Keep it together.
You can do this.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.138
Julian, how long has it been
since we ate the fucking things?

27:20.221 --> 27:22.265
I don't know. 20, 30 minutes maybe.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.560
I'm not in the right frame of mind
for this. That's the problem.

27:25.643 --> 27:26.770
Yeah, listen. You can't be scared

27:26.853 --> 27:28.646
or you're definitely gonna have
a fucking bad trip

27:28.730 --> 27:30.565
and be dealing with demons
and fucking zombies

27:30.648 --> 27:32.525
and bugs trying
to fucking claw your eyes--

27:32.609 --> 27:35.570
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky! Stop it!
You're making it worse.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.489
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Lahey?

27:37.864 --> 27:40.658
Yeah, I feel okay.
How about you?

27:41.076 --> 27:42.702
I think so.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.372
Would we be talking about this
if we were... frigged up?

27:45.455 --> 27:47.665
[Lahey giggling]
I don't know!

27:48.083 --> 27:51.294
[Steinberg] Gentlemen,
I've got good news and bad news.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.963
Or what I would say, more like...

27:54.047 --> 27:55.757
okay news, semi-okay news or--

27:55.840 --> 27:57.884
-What's the fucking news?
-Oh yeah, okay.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.011
I think we're gonna be okay
on the drug charges.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.012
Yes!

28:01.096 --> 28:03.014
Yeah. Tommy did, in fact,
rat you guys out,

28:03.098 --> 28:06.226
but there's no hard evidence
linking you guys to it.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.228
So I'm pretty confident
I can beat that.

28:08.311 --> 28:11.231
-But it's not gonna be cheap.
-What about the other shit?

28:11.314 --> 28:13.316
Well, the evading the police, uh,

28:13.400 --> 28:15.693
damage to public and private property,
et cetera, et cetera.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.154
Now you're probably gonna have
to eat that.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.281
But, hey, at least
no one got hurt, right?

28:20.365 --> 28:22.242
[Jacob] My neck got broken actually.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.494
[Steinberg] Ooh. Nice.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.579
Might be able to use that
to our advantage.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.206
-[Ricky] Good job, buddy!
-What?

28:28.289 --> 28:29.999
Okay, thanks, man.
Just keep us in the loop

28:30.083 --> 28:33.044
-if anything comes up, all right?
-Yeah. We should talk fees.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.547
We'll talk fees, okay?
But not right now.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.091
And you better not fucking
fuck me over again.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.926
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I'll be in touch.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.388
[Bubbles whimpering] Julian...

28:43.471 --> 28:46.266
Julian, I'm definitely
starting to notice

28:46.349 --> 28:48.727
-that I'm not right.
-Go with it. Just go with it.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.146
I'm not right.
I'm starting to feel...

28:51.229 --> 28:54.149
How long does it take
for them to totally kick in?

28:54.733 --> 28:57.360
[Ricky] I think
they just did, boys.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.404
[Bubbles screaming] Ricky!

28:59.487 --> 29:03.074
Holy fuck! Was I fucked?
I feel like a cartoon!

29:03.158 --> 29:05.493
-[Bubbles whimpering]
-[Ricky] Oh my God!

29:05.577 --> 29:07.829
-This is fucking amazing.
-Ricky...

29:07.912 --> 29:10.582
-You guys gotta try this!
-[Cory] You're spreading it, dude!

29:10.665 --> 29:12.625
-Ricky!
-You guys seeing this too?

29:12.709 --> 29:15.754
-[Bubbles] Ah, stop it, Ricky!
-[Randy] I'll protect you, Mr. Lahey.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.590
[Ricky] I hope this never fucking ends!

29:19.758 --> 29:22.177
[mixed moaning, whimpering]

29:24.053 --> 29:25.847
Aw, dudes, this is dope.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.183
-We're cartoons!
-Boys...

29:28.641 --> 29:29.809
we're fucked.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.895
[Ricky] Yeah-h-h! Yes!

29:47.035 --> 29:49.788
You know what the best currency is?

29:49.871 --> 29:52.332
And I just thought
about this yesterday.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.459
The best currency,

29:54.542 --> 29:56.544
the most valuable of all,

29:56.628 --> 29:58.421
is gratitude.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.715
And if...

30:03.593 --> 30:05.428
When you're dead,
you're dead,

30:06.012 --> 30:08.014
but you're not quite so dead

30:08.640 --> 30:10.642
if you contribute something.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.608
[theme music]

31:00.149 --> 31:03.778
[seagulls squawking]

31:14.747 --> 31:18.501
[fish] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

31:18.585 --> 31:21.296
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

31:24.883 --> 31:26.426
[whisper] Fuck.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.553
-[light clicks off]
-Fuck off.
