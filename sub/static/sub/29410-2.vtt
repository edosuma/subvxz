Uh, the cyanotic discoloration
of the lips

How do you know?

08:18.715 --> 08:20.325
Four separate meals.

They even have their own
condiments and serving dishes.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.464
This family
didn't share anything.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.858
Someone demanded they attend.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.034
I'm betting on Aristos,
the father.

[quietly]:
He does know about bad dads.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.778
BRIGHT:
And since there was no
forced entry,

08:37.821 --> 08:40.607
We can assume they knew
the killer and let him in.

08:44.349 --> 08:47.396
What's this discoloration?

08:47.439 --> 08:48.702
Vitiligo.

08:48.745 --> 08:51.487
So the disease causes the skin
to lose pigment.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.706
There's also fresh bruising

08:52.749 --> 08:54.490
on either side of the face.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.492
He's also been crying.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.104
Crying... bruising...

09:01.671 --> 09:03.847
The killer held his head
so he couldn't look away.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.764
Aristos was forced to watch.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.464
That's why they were tied up.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.511
This wasn't only murder,
it was torture.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.166
Targeting the father, Aristos.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.647
He had a front row seat
at his family's execution.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.909
The killer must have
poisoned Aristos

09:21.952 --> 09:23.475
after the others died.

09:23.519 --> 09:26.827
There's also a postmortem
incision in his epigastric area.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.132
Why would he do that?

09:28.176 --> 09:29.917
Give me a sec, I'll take a look.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.833
So, we're dealing with
a highly organized killer,

09:32.876 --> 09:36.358

with Aristos as the target.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.691
Snakes!

11:32.996 --> 11:33.910
What the hell?

11:33.954 --> 11:37.479
Where'd they come from?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.742
They were inside the victim.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.223
The killer inserted them
through the abdomen.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.617
GIL:
Hey, seal the perimeter!

11:45.661 --> 11:46.923
And put a rush on ESU.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.447
Edrisa, I need you to move away
from the body.

11:49.491 --> 11:52.755
I can't. There's one on me.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.975
It's okay. Don't move.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.454
How do you know
they're not poisonous?

11:56.498 --> 11:58.456
Oh, they're very poisonous.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.763
The black mouth,
coffin-shaped head.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.025
These are black mambas.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.635
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

12:03.679 --> 12:05.768
It's okay.
I had a few snakes as a kid.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.335
[quietly]:
Of course you did.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.992
-How you doing, Edrisa?
-I can't move.

12:12.035 --> 12:15.647
That's good.
Your brain is protecting you.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.780
There's a part of the cerebellum
called the vermis.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.739
It's one of the more primitive
parts of the brain.

12:19.782 --> 12:23.003
When you're afraid, it can
freeze your motor functions.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.047
That's fascinating.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.962
Right? I know.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.182
For a million years,
our brains have been freezing us

12:28.225 --> 12:29.966
at the sight of snakes.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.795
Which makes sense.

12:35.276 --> 12:38.758
'Cause if we don't move,
we're not a threat.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.762
Slow breaths, Edrisa.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.376
But when we do move...

12:56.079 --> 12:58.516
GIL:
Secure those snakes.
ESU is coming.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.911
-You're okay.
-Thank you.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.348
Ooh.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.829
Okay, you can stay
for one more case.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.700
[laughs softly]

13:10.137 --> 13:11.529
BRIGHT:
This is Bright.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.358
-Leave a message.
-[phone beeps]

13:14.402 --> 13:16.839
Hello, Malcolm, it's your dad.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.536
I heard more about the case.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.016
Ooh. Gruesome stuff.

13:20.060 --> 13:24.281
Anyways, if you want
to bounce around some ideas,

13:24.325 --> 13:25.892
give me a call.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.203
[exhales]

13:33.247 --> 13:34.683
[door opens]

13:34.726 --> 13:37.947
-Edrisa?
-Is fine. Don't worry.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.471
She's already back to work.
Got her tox screen.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.865
The Boutsikaris
were poisoned with metoprolol,

13:42.909 --> 13:44.867
-a beta blocker.
-BRIGHT: Nasty stuff.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.216
Killer used it
to shut down their hearts.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.870
Well,
they certainly had enemies.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.132
The family made their money
in the shipping trade.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.742
You know how many shifty people

13:50.786 --> 13:51.961
-they dealt with?
-DANI: They have been involved

13:52.005 --> 13:54.050
in hundreds
of lawsuits over the years.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.878
Government fines. They were
even investigated by Interpol.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.576
JT:
Oh, family of snakes.
Maybe that's the message.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.665
A business associate
after revenge.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.015
BRIGHT:
No, this crime scene

14:02.058 --> 14:03.886
didn't feel like business.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.062
It felt personal,
like it was directed at Aristos.

14:06.106 --> 14:09.196
-Don't all murders
seem personal to you?
-JT, shut up.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.980
-You're a dick.
-BRIGHT: No.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.069
JT's right. We're-we're not
gonna get anywhere

14:13.113 --> 14:15.419
until we move through this,
so let's do it.

14:15.463 --> 14:19.902
Hi. My name's Malcolm Bright,
but I was morn Malcolm Whitly.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.991
My father is Dr. Martin Whitly,

14:22.035 --> 14:25.516
one of the most notorious serial
killers since Jack the Ripper.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.432
Killed 23 people, at least.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.913
All while raising me
as the perfect dad.

14:30.957 --> 14:36.049
Yes, he's a psychopath,
but I'm not.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.877
I'm just me.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.923
What else can I tell you?

14:40.967 --> 14:45.319
Was it, um... like--

14:45.362 --> 14:46.929
Was it weird?

14:46.973 --> 14:50.367
Having a serial killer
for a father?

14:50.411 --> 14:53.501
Yeah. It was super weird.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.768
Okay. Good talk.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.552
Now, back to those snakes.

15:01.596 --> 15:04.512
In mythology,
snakes represent fertility,

15:04.555 --> 15:06.644
guardianship and vengeance.

15:06.688 --> 15:09.038
I'm-a take a wild guess
and say it was vengeance.

15:09.082 --> 15:11.040
-At Aristos.
-Yes. Right.

15:11.084 --> 15:14.043
Our killer was so angry,
he destroyed an entire family.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.959
We may be dealing
with a family annihilator.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.396
-What's the MO?
-Well, there are
several classifications.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.485
The self-righteous blame
their mother,

15:21.529 --> 15:23.052
the anomic fear financial ruin,

15:23.096 --> 15:24.967
the paranoid kill
to protect their family

15:25.011 --> 15:29.493
from a perceived threat,
the disappointed want love.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.365
They're usually male,
struggle with depression

15:31.408 --> 15:33.976
-and often kill
themselves afterward.
-But not this one.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.978
Are we sure there aren't
any more family members?

15:36.022 --> 15:39.503
I'll circle back with the DMV,
Social Security office.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.505
[phone buzzing]

15:45.031 --> 15:46.684
You gonna answer that?

15:48.773 --> 15:50.340
No.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.081
BRIGHT:
This is Bright.
Leave a message.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.474
[phone beeps]

15:53.517 --> 15:55.780
I respect that you're conflicted
about picking up,

15:55.824 --> 15:58.000
but as Oscar Wilde said,

15:58.044 --> 16:01.699
"The only way to fight
temptation is to yield to it."

16:01.743 --> 16:04.006
Oh, it's Dad, by the way.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.877
Give me a call.

16:05.921 --> 16:07.967
Malcolm, Dad.
Remember Bradford Bishop?

16:08.010 --> 16:10.230
Killed five members
of his family in '76

16:10.273 --> 16:11.492
and was never caught?

16:11.535 --> 16:13.015
I always wondered...

16:14.103 --> 16:16.366
Well, phone time
is ending for the day.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.020
A total bust. Thanks for that.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.935
I really would like to speak
with you. You sounded tired

16:19.979 --> 16:22.242
on the phone. You know,
maybe I can help with that.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.504
I don't know.
Help with anything.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.071
I just want to help, damn it!

16:27.247 --> 16:29.031
[chuckles]

16:29.075 --> 16:32.556
Well, hopefully,
we can speak tomorrow.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.993
Goodbye, my boy.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.962
[phone chimes]

16:51.619 --> 16:53.621
So, Aristos had another son?

16:53.664 --> 16:55.362
Yes, sir. Liam Hauser.

16:55.405 --> 16:58.234
He changed his name five years
ago back in Greece

16:58.278 --> 17:01.063
after he and his dad
had a falling out.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.499
He could be
our family annihilator.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.980
Or the next victim.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.939
What is this place?

17:07.983 --> 17:10.420
No idea, but the building's
deed's in Liam's name.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.727
There he is.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.513
-Liam?
-NYPD.

17:16.557 --> 17:20.039
JT:
You have a minute
to answer a few questions?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.304
LIAM:
Uh, yeah.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.609
Sure, what can I do for you?

17:25.653 --> 17:27.089
Have you spoken
to your family recently?

17:27.133 --> 17:29.091
[chuckles]
No.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.441
Not in, like, five years.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.269
We're-we're not close.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.706
Why? What's up?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.275
Well, I hate to be
the one to tell you this...

17:39.319 --> 17:41.060
They were murdered.

17:47.283 --> 17:50.895
Well, uh, like-like I said,
I don't, uh...

17:50.939 --> 17:54.464
Wait, do you not know
who did it?

17:54.508 --> 17:57.163
Not yet. We were hoping that you
could help us figure that out.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.425
I-I got no clue.

17:58.468 --> 18:02.255
Like I said,
I haven't seen them in years.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.995
What happened?

18:04.039 --> 18:05.649
-There were poisoned.
-BRIGHT: And snakes

18:05.693 --> 18:08.739
were left behind at the scene.

18:08.783 --> 18:12.091
That mean anything to you?

18:12.134 --> 18:13.570
No.

18:13.614 --> 18:16.965
Those are some pretty serious
gloves you have there.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.707
Double Kevlar? Custom-made?

18:20.795 --> 18:23.580
Sorry, uh, do you mind
if I just...

18:23.624 --> 18:25.016
take a breather?
[chuckles]

18:25.060 --> 18:26.975
This is just, it's all so...

18:28.281 --> 18:29.673
Wait here.

18:31.414 --> 18:32.763
GIL:
Wait, wait. Hold up.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.025
[animals chittering]

18:34.069 --> 18:35.592
What the hell is that sound?

18:35.636 --> 18:37.333
JT:
What's that smell?

18:37.377 --> 18:39.640
[animal growls]

18:40.467 --> 18:42.643
[birds twittering, squawking]

18:49.737 --> 18:52.174
He's a black market
animal dealer.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.307
Damn it, Bright,
I told you to wait.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.137
[animals growling, chittering]

19:08.582 --> 19:10.845
[low growling]

[thudding]

19:34.260 --> 19:35.913
BRIGHT:
Liam.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.915
We just want to talk.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.831
[snake hisses]

19:48.143 --> 19:50.754

-That way.

19:50.798 --> 19:53.104
Bright.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.237
-[hisses]
-Ah... [grunts]

19:55.281 --> 19:57.935
[laughs]
It's fine.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.937
Fine. It was just a small one.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.243
Probably not e...

20:03.463 --> 20:05.595
This is Detective Powell
with the 1-6.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.250
I got a 10-13,
I need an ambulance.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.252
[echoing]:
Hey, Bright? Bright.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.254
I need you to look at me, okay?
You're gonna be fine.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.516
You're gonna be fine.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.127
Breathe. Breathe. Bright.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.781
No, no, no, no. Bright.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.305
-[yells]
-[muffled]: Help is coming.

20:21.568 --> 20:25.224
Dad?

Dad, what's in here?

20:41.501 --> 20:42.719
[Martin shushing]

20:42.763 --> 20:43.981
It's okay, it's okay.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.505
It's all gonna be okay.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.550

-[panting]
-[monitor beeping]

20:51.337 --> 20:52.642
Hello?

20:52.686 --> 20:54.644
-Where is...
-Oh, my God.

20:54.688 --> 20:55.906
Hello?

20:55.950 --> 20:57.473
Get Dr. Canter. He's awake.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.693
W-What's in this?
W-What drug did you give me?

20:59.736 --> 21:02.739
-I need to be able to wake up!
I need to be able to wake up.
-It's all under control.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.437
What did you give me?!

21:08.484 --> 21:11.705
LITTMAN:
Liam Hauser has asked me
to relay a message.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.315
Why you?

21:13.359 --> 21:16.362
It's my understanding Mr. Hauser

21:16.405 --> 21:18.581
was estranged from our victims.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.409
Well, I've represented
the Boutsikaris family

21:20.453 --> 21:22.846
for some time, and Liam knows,

21:22.890 --> 21:24.413
in spite of their schism,

21:24.457 --> 21:26.546
I'll do my best to protect him.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.199
Let me guess, he didn't do it?

21:28.243 --> 21:31.420
That said, he would
be willing to come in

21:31.464 --> 21:33.204
and discuss your
homicide investigation...

21:33.248 --> 21:34.423
Great.

21:34.467 --> 21:37.339
...if you can guarantee
he won't be charged

21:37.383 --> 21:39.515
with anything in connection
with his import-export business.

21:39.559 --> 21:40.951
That's a non-starter.

21:40.995 --> 21:44.520
I've got a guy in the ER
because of him.

21:44.564 --> 21:48.219
Look, I got a warrant out
for Liam's arrest.

21:48.263 --> 21:49.351
If you really cared
about your client...

21:49.395 --> 21:53.529
His father was my client
and friend.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.836
I'm sorry.

21:55.879 --> 21:58.360
Yeah. Let me know if I can help.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.591
Knock, knock.

22:11.634 --> 22:14.028
-They can't force me to stay.
-Aw, is that how you talk

22:14.071 --> 22:16.335
to your "in case of emergency"
person?

22:16.378 --> 22:19.250
Since when did you
get back into snakes?

22:19.294 --> 22:22.079
I'm not. Tell them I'll sign
the discharge AMA.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.994
They don't even know
how you're awake.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.518
You were given
some serious sedatives.

22:25.561 --> 22:26.997
What was it, fentanyl?

22:27.041 --> 22:28.434
I take that
in my morning coffee.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.392
-Not something to brag about.
-Look,

22:30.436 --> 22:32.742
I don't take sedatives
anymore, okay?

22:32.786 --> 22:36.616
If I can't wake up,
it's like I'm trapped in there.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.574
With Dad?

22:38.618 --> 22:41.490
