Aw.

00:54.148 --> 00:57.015
(yelling)

00:58.920 --> 01:01.388
What the?

01:01.422 --> 01:02.684
Dang cable company.

01:02.723 --> 01:04.986
I told them I didn’t want
a hole in my wall.

01:05.025 --> 01:08.223
This is what I get?

01:19.707 --> 01:20.435
(screaming)

01:20.475 --> 01:22.568
(screaming louder)

01:24.145 --> 01:28.047
So, you found the tunnel.

01:28.082 --> 01:33.042
Is this the hole
you were talking about?

01:33.087 --> 01:35.055
Dale, what the hell
were you thinking

01:35.089 --> 01:37.387
digging a tunnel
under my house?

01:37.425 --> 01:38.619
You should be
flattered.

01:38.659 --> 01:41.492
Think of it as a
two-way friendship tube.

01:41.529 --> 01:42.723
I can escape
to your house

01:42.763 --> 01:44.094
when the Feds
come a-knockin'

01:44.131 --> 01:45.723
and you can slip
over to mine

01:45.766 --> 01:49.167
when some jealous
husband comes
looking for you.

01:49.203 --> 01:51.569
There will always be
husbands jealous of Hank

01:51.606 --> 01:52.834
for marrying me.

01:52.874 --> 01:56.139
There is no place
on Earth he can
hide from them.

01:56.177 --> 01:57.735
No wonder I fell through...

01:57.778 --> 01:59.609
my floor joists are missing.

01:59.647 --> 02:01.911
Uh, is that
what that was?

02:01.949 --> 02:04.281
I thought it was
underground driftwood.

02:04.318 --> 02:07.185
I used it too reinforce
the walls of my tunnel.

02:07.221 --> 02:10.315
Did you want me digging
in an unsafe tunnel?

02:10.358 --> 02:11.950
Did ya, Hank?

02:11.993 --> 02:13.927
Aw, it's going to take
a lot of hard work

02:13.961 --> 02:15.326
to repair this floor.

02:15.363 --> 02:17.593
And since this is
all your fault, mister

02:17.632 --> 02:19.327
I'm not going
to let you help me.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.733
Can I help?

02:21.769 --> 02:25.637
Yes, Bobby.

02:25.673 --> 02:29.439
I fall through
the floor

02:29.477 --> 02:30.444
I'd say
on the average

02:30.478 --> 02:31.445
about once a year.

02:31.479 --> 02:33.970
So, fellas, I rented
a brand-new 6,000 RPM

02:34.015 --> 02:35.846
high-torque circular saw.

02:35.883 --> 02:37.248
Boomhauer...

02:37.285 --> 02:39.253
How'd you like
to cut some wood?

02:39.287 --> 02:41.255
Oh, man, you gonna
have to ask, man?

02:41.289 --> 02:42.256
Dang ol...

02:42.290 --> 02:43.552
Bill, you can be next,
then me

02:43.591 --> 02:47.618
then Bobby,
and that's it.

02:47.662 --> 02:48.720
But, no, wait.

02:48.763 --> 02:51.027
Hey, Khan, you want
to try my new saw?

02:51.065 --> 02:52.692
KHAN:
How many RPM?

02:52.733 --> 02:53.700
6,000.

02:53.734 --> 02:59.468
Nah.

02:59.507 --> 03:01.475
Oh, here comes
the city inspector.

03:01.509 --> 03:03.170
Bobby, get inside.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.177
Are you the owner?

03:04.211 --> 03:05.178
Yes, sir.

03:05.212 --> 03:06.270
Hank R. Hill.

03:06.314 --> 03:08.282
Just like it said
on my application

03:08.316 --> 03:09.613
for a building permit.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.618
Did you get my check
for six dollars?

03:11.652 --> 03:14.018
Yes, along with
a transcript
of your grades

03:14.055 --> 03:15.750
from high school
shop class.

03:15.790 --> 03:16.757
Quite impressive.

03:16.791 --> 03:22.752
I admire you for hiring
the mentally challenged.

03:25.766 --> 03:26.733
Mr. Hill, you have

03:26.767 --> 03:28.132
a serious problem here.

03:28.169 --> 03:29.329
Without any floor joists

03:29.370 --> 03:31.338
this house is unsafe
to inhabit.

03:31.372 --> 03:33.340
What if we just stay
out of the kitchen?

03:33.374 --> 03:35.342
I've got a fridge
in the garage...

03:35.376 --> 03:36.343
a propane grill.

03:36.377 --> 03:37.867
Oh, good,
problem solved.

03:37.912 --> 03:40.005
Do I look like some jackass
from Power and Light?

03:40.047 --> 03:41.014
No, sir.

03:41.048 --> 03:43.073
And I ain't going
back there, either.

03:43.117 --> 03:45.415
HANK:
Red tag?!

03:45.453 --> 03:47.045
No, no, green tag.

03:47.088 --> 03:48.112
Green tag!

03:48.155 --> 03:50.487
You need to evacuate
the domicile immediately.

03:50.524 --> 03:52.321
When can he
move back in?

03:52.360 --> 03:55.352
(as to a child):
When all the repairs
have been made.

03:55.396 --> 03:57.364
Would you boys like
a piece of hard candy?

03:57.398 --> 04:00.458
Yes, yes, I would,
please like a piece of candy.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.469
I'd like to see
these men in helmets.

04:02.503 --> 04:05.631
I don't mind us
staying at grandpa’s

04:05.673 --> 04:08.335
but I won't share a bed
with Baby G.H.

04:08.376 --> 04:10.537
He always tries to suck
on my boobie.

04:10.578 --> 04:12.375
Hank, Peggy...

04:12.413 --> 04:14.574
Dale has something
he wants to ask you.

04:14.615 --> 04:15.582
Uh... (mumbling)

04:15.616 --> 04:16.583
Sug...

04:16.617 --> 04:19.279
Look, Hank,
I dug a tunnel

04:19.320 --> 04:21.515
you fell through it.

04:21.555 --> 04:23.648
Mistakes were made
on both sides.

04:23.691 --> 04:25.682
What do you say
you and yours

04:25.726 --> 04:27.318
come and stay with
me and mine?

04:27.361 --> 04:28.851
You can take
the tunnel over.

04:28.896 --> 04:32.332
Thank you, but we’re
being taken in by family.

04:32.366 --> 04:33.526
Hank, come on.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.762
Dale drives me nuts
living next door.

04:35.803 --> 04:38.966
There's a reason he and I
didn't get an apartment together

04:39.006 --> 04:39.973
after high school.

04:40.007 --> 04:41.975
Last time I stayed
at your father’s

04:42.009 --> 04:43.169
he threw a grenade at me.

04:43.210 --> 04:45.178
It was a practice
grenade, but still...

04:45.212 --> 04:47.373
it was a very
hostile gesture.

04:47.415 --> 04:48.677
(sighs)

04:48.716 --> 04:50.047
All right.

04:50.084 --> 04:51.051
Thanks, Dale.

04:51.085 --> 04:53.053
Uh, we'll do it.

04:58.759 --> 05:02.456
Strange bathroom,
no night-light.

05:02.496 --> 05:05.693
I hope Mr. Gribble isn't
counting on 100% accuracy.

05:05.733 --> 05:07.724
Well, sit if you have to.

05:07.768 --> 05:08.735
I do.

05:08.769 --> 05:09.736
When I have to.

05:09.770 --> 05:14.969
MAN:
He's going for $100!

05:15.009 --> 05:16.977
Dale, what do you
think you're doing?

05:17.011 --> 05:19.138
Nancy won't let me watch
TV in the bedroom.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.147
It keeps her up.

05:20.181 --> 05:22.172
You've got
to see this.

05:22.216 --> 05:25.674
They got a guy swallowing bees
for 100 bucks.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.915
Dang it, Dale,
it's after 10:00 p.m.

05:27.955 --> 05:32.392
Hank, you don’t want
to use that remote...

05:32.426 --> 05:34.121
(explosion)

05:34.161 --> 05:35.458
There goes the mailbox.

05:35.496 --> 05:37.691
You have an exploding mailbox?

05:37.732 --> 05:39.256
That was your mailbox.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.995
And yes, I do.

05:41.035 --> 05:42.229
My goodness.

05:42.269 --> 05:47.138
It's like my own
little diner in here.

05:47.174 --> 05:50.837
Well, somebody's
not getting a tip.

05:50.878 --> 05:52.175
I'm exhausted.

05:52.213 --> 05:54.010
2:00 a.m., Dale
wakes me up

05:54.048 --> 05:56.039
to spot him while
lifts weights.

05:56.083 --> 05:59.450
Peggy, the man
benches 35 pounds.

05:59.487 --> 06:05.448
Hmm... wow, look at that chunk.

06:05.493 --> 06:06.517
Ugh.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.754
What's this?

06:07.795 --> 06:09.990
Your welcome to sleep here
free of charge

06:10.030 --> 06:11.998
but consumables are
another matter.

06:12.032 --> 06:14.000
You'll see it's
all listed here.

06:14.034 --> 06:18.061
Water, electricity,
two rolls of toilet paper.

06:18.105 --> 06:20.039
I've had enough
of you, Dale.

06:20.241 --> 06:23.438
I'll finish my shredded wheat
out at the construction site.

06:23.477 --> 06:25.104
I want that bowl back!

06:30.151 --> 06:31.311
Hank...

06:31.452 --> 06:33.420
Did you use the towels

06:33.454 --> 06:35.422
that were hanging
in the bathroom?

06:35.456 --> 06:36.650
Those are just for
decoration.

06:36.690 --> 06:37.816
Now they're ruined.

06:37.858 --> 06:40.019
Dale, those
were paper towels.

06:40.060 --> 06:42.551
And tell your wife
to answer the phone

06:42.596 --> 06:44.860
"Gribble residence."
Not "hello."

06:44.899 --> 06:48.130
Hey, you're not cutting
that board very straight.

06:48.169 --> 06:50.228
Aren’t you supposed
to be inside the lines?

06:50.271 --> 06:52.671
You're outside
the lines, see?

06:52.706 --> 06:54.333
Oh, no.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.811
Oh, my God.

06:57.845 --> 06:59.335
(gasps)

06:59.380 --> 07:01.871
(screaming)

07:10.024 --> 07:10.991
I can't believe

07:11.025 --> 07:12.993
I cut off my
best friend's finger.

07:13.027 --> 07:15.325
And I just reread
that safety manual.

07:15.362 --> 07:17.626
I don't understand
how this could have
happened, Hank.

07:17.665 --> 07:20.498
I mean, I've been known
to do carpentry stone-drunk

07:20.534 --> 07:23.196
but you’re normally
so careful around tools.

07:23.237 --> 07:25.637
DALE:
He was careful,
all right.

07:25.673 --> 07:27.834
Careful to make it look
like an accident.

07:29.844 --> 07:30.811
You were getting back at me

07:30.845 --> 07:33.439
for what I did
to your tacky linoleum floor.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.107
That is not true.

07:35.149 --> 07:38.312
I should have never
moved in with you.

07:38.352 --> 07:40.650
I think we might have
a domestic abuse
situation here.

07:40.688 --> 07:43.054
The big one's already
cuttle little one's
finger off.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.820
It always happens to the
younger prettier ones.

07:45.860 --> 07:47.191
If it were
up to you

07:47.228 --> 07:49.719
you would have filled
my buddy tunnel with cement

07:49.763 --> 07:51.697
so no one else
could use it.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.700
Sir, do you wish
to press assault charges?

07:53.734 --> 07:55.065
Assault charges?

07:55.102 --> 07:56.262
Damn right I do.

07:56.303 --> 07:58.271
Officer, take him away.

07:58.305 --> 07:59.533
And see that his
human rights

07:59.573 --> 08:01.564
are roundly violated.

08:01.609 --> 08:05.204
Mr. Hill, Mr. Gribble
alleges

08:05.246 --> 08:07.680
that you intentionally
severed his finger.

08:07.715 --> 08:10.115
Your honor, it was an accident.

08:10.150 --> 08:13.051
We're wasting valuable
legal resources here.

08:13.087 --> 08:15.214
Objection. Conjecture.

08:15.256 --> 08:16.223
Objecture.

08:16.257 --> 08:17.849
That's not a word.

08:17.892 --> 08:21.259
Mr. Hill, please
control your outbursts.

08:21.295 --> 08:23.263
I am issuing
a restraining order.

08:23.297 --> 08:25.697
You are not to go
within 100 feet

08:25.733 --> 08:26.700
of Mr. Gribble.

08:26.734 --> 08:28.531
What?! That is crazy.

08:28.569 --> 08:30.537
I live within a hundred feet
of him.

08:30.571 --> 08:33.096
How am I going
to fix the house
that he ruined?

08:33.140 --> 08:37.634
You seem to have a serious
problem controlling your rage.

08:37.678 --> 08:41.135
I'm sentencing you
to an anger management class.

08:41.181 --> 08:42.148
Until you pass

08:42.182 --> 08:44.446
the restraining order
remains in effect.

08:44.485 --> 08:46.043
Anger management?

08:46.086 --> 08:48.054
That's for guys
who spit on umpires.

08:48.088 --> 08:49.214
I don't need that class.

08:49.256 --> 08:51.747
You do if you ever want
to move back into your house.

08:51.792 --> 08:56.991
Dale, you're lighting
your finger.

08:57.031 --> 08:58.555
Oh. Thanks
for the heads up.

08:58.599 --> 09:00.965
I still can't feel
anything in the digit.

09:01.001 --> 09:02.059
What's that?

09:02.102 --> 09:05.196
Dale has no feeling
in the finger you cut off.

09:05.239 --> 09:06.206
Accidentally.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.368
You know, if you want, Bill,
Boomhauer, one of you guys

09:09.410 --> 09:11.037
can come stand over by me.

09:11.078 --> 09:13.410
BILL:
I'll wait till you pass
that anger class.

09:13.447 --> 09:16.575
You cut Dale's finger off
for digging a tunnel.

09:16.617 --> 09:19.745
I once made a vest
out of your wife’s underpants.

09:19.787 --> 09:21.846
I can't imagine
what you'd do to me.

09:21.889 --> 09:23.220
Come on, I wouldn't hurt you.

09:23.257 --> 09:25.748
You guys know I don't have
a problem with anger.

09:25.793 --> 09:27.693
I have a problem with idiots.

09:27.728 --> 09:29.593
Hold it
right there.

09:29.630 --> 09:30.597
One more step

09:30.631 --> 09:31.598
and you'll have to move

09:31.632 --> 09:33.759
to a similar house
a few blocks away.

09:33.801 --> 09:36.429
Not too pretty
a picture, is it?

09:36.470 --> 09:39.064
Dang it.

09:39.106 --> 09:40.801
(groans)

09:40.841 --> 09:46.108
Oh, God, he's on
another rampage!

09:46.146 --> 09:49.741
Pray for us all!

09:49.783 --> 09:51.751
Let's give a nice,
calm anger management

09:51.785 --> 09:56.552
welcome to Hank Hill,
our newest student.

09:56.590 --> 09:57.557
(various greetings)

09:57.591 --> 09:59.957
Hank cut his neighbor's finger
off with a saw

09:59.994 --> 10:01.393
in a fit of rage.

10:01.428 --> 10:02.588
No, no, no.

10:02.629 --> 10:04.028
It was an accident.

10:04.064 --> 10:06.760
My neighbor put his finger
in front of the blade.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.767
Hank, my man

10:07.801 --> 10:10.292
that's what we call
"blaming others."

10:10.337 --> 10:12.771
It's not my fault
his finger was there.

10:12.806 --> 10:15.969
It's not my fault
I ran a woman off the road

10:16.010 --> 10:17.978
when she changed lanes
without signaling.

10:18.012 --> 10:20.242
Hmm, right, Big Jim?

10:20.280 --> 10:22.248
She had a cell phone
in one hand

10:22.282 --> 10:24.250
and a Lands' End catalog
in the other.

10:24.284 --> 10:25.512
Dirt bag got what
she deserves.

10:25.552 --> 10:29.215
Next time, you want to call
someone a dirt bag

10:29.256 --> 10:32.157
stop and picture that person
as a big bag of dirt.

10:32.192 --> 10:33.659
Just a big

10:33.694 --> 10:37.186
old bag of dirt
driving her SUV.

10:37.231 --> 10:38.630
And you know what?

10:38.665 --> 10:39.654
You'll have to pull over

10:39.700 --> 10:43.329
'cause you'll have the giggles.

10:43.370 --> 10:48.467
That's what we call

10:48.509 --> 10:49.476
"silly humor."

10:49.510 --> 10:50.477
Hank, you're not laughing.

10:50.511 --> 10:51.910
At a bag of dirt?

10:51.945 --> 10:53.207
What's funny about that?

10:53.247 --> 10:55.807
Wow, you are just
a bundle of rage.

10:55.849 --> 10:57.874
My goodness, if you
become angry

10:57.918 --> 10:59.886
even in this
peaceful environment

10:59.920 --> 11:00.887
you're on your way

11:00.921 --> 11:02.889
to a massive heart attack
or stroke.

11:02.923 --> 11:03.890
I'm not angry.

11:03.924 --> 11:04.891
I am a little annoyed

11:04.925 --> 11:06.893
I have to be stuck
in this stupid class

11:06.927 --> 11:09.760
for the next
eight Saturdays.

11:09.797 --> 11:12.425
Why don’t you pet
an imaginary cat.

11:12.466 --> 11:15.492
Just... like... this.

11:15.536 --> 11:20.337
Slow... and gentle...
and easy.

11:20.374 --> 11:21.500
I call her Soothie.

11:21.542 --> 11:22.941
Soothie the kitty.

11:22.976 --> 11:23.965
Want to pet her?

11:24.011 --> 11:24.978
I'll pass.

11:25.012 --> 11:27.776
Come on, pet
Mr. Mellowpuss.

11:27.815 --> 11:28.839
He says he doesn't
want to pet

11:28.882 --> 11:30.213
the freakin'
invisible cat.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.844
Leave him alone!

11:32.886 --> 11:33.853
Thanks, buddy.

11:33.887 --> 11:38.085
Then they tell me
if someone does
something stupid

11:38.125 --> 11:42.323
I'm supposed to think
of a calming phrase

11:42.362 --> 11:44.990
like, "Relax, Mr. Angry Slacks."

11:45.032 --> 11:48.331
Or, "Cool it down,
grumpy clown."

11:48.368 --> 11:50.029
You see, it's asinine.

11:50.070 --> 11:51.435
Take it easy,
Parcheesi.

11:51.472 --> 11:53.440
That is exactly
the kind of anger

11:53.474 --> 11:55.442
that leads you
to cutting off
people's fingers.

11:55.476 --> 11:59.242
Peggy, you of all people know
I didn't do that on purpose.

11:59.279 --> 12:01.247
All right, Hank,
I wasn't there.

12:01.281 --> 12:03.749
Now, isn't it possible
that somewhere

12:03.784 --> 12:04.876
in your subconscious

12:04.918 --> 12:06.977
you really wanted
to hurt Dale?

12:07.020 --> 12:08.851
No! It's not
possible!

12:08.889 --> 12:10.857
DIDI:
Hank has always
been angry.

12:10.891 --> 12:12.222
When we were
in kindergarten

12:12.259 --> 12:14.489
and the other children
would use the fingerpaints

12:14.528 --> 12:15.722
he would pinch them.

12:15.762 --> 12:17.992
You are a bald-faced liar!

12:18.031 --> 12:19.157
Amen!

12:22.069 --> 12:25.300
Now, I'm going to teach you
all a little dance.

12:25.339 --> 12:27.398
The "Avoid-dance."

12:27.441 --> 12:29.807
Who has a child who keeps
a messy room, hmm?

12:29.843 --> 12:32.243
Next time you
walk by

12:32.279 --> 12:35.305
Junior's messy room
shut the door.

12:35.349 --> 12:37.317
Don't look at what
infuriates you.

12:37.351 --> 12:40.616
Just do this little dance.

12:40.654 --> 12:41.621
Shut the door...

12:41.655 --> 12:44.249
shut the door, shut the door.

12:44.291 --> 12:45.588
Come on Hank,
stand up

12:45.626 --> 12:47.150
and do the Avoid-dance
with me.

12:47.194 --> 12:48.388
Everyone join in!

12:48.428 --> 12:49.622
Shut the door...

12:49.663 --> 12:51.290
ALL:
Shut the door...

12:51.331 --> 12:53.959
Big Jim, is there a reason
you're not shutting the door?

12:54.001 --> 12:57.368
'Cause you're a pencil-neck,
who's got diarrhea of the mouth.

12:57.404 --> 12:59.429
Okay, anger, anger.

12:59.473 --> 13:01.100
Try silly humor.

13:01.141 --> 13:04.167
Can you picture poo poo
coming out of my mouth?

13:04.211 --> 13:07.203
No, but I can picture it coming
out of my butt.

13:07.247 --> 13:08.271
Can I have a hall pass?

13:08.315 --> 13:09.942
Of course.

13:09.983 --> 13:15.649
Uh, I think I have to...
uh...

13:15.689 --> 13:17.281
make, too.

13:17.324 --> 13:19.053
Excuse me.

13:19.092 --> 13:21.720
Can you believe
that bunk he's selling?

13:21.762 --> 13:22.786
Don't ever get angry?

13:22.829 --> 13:25.059
You turn
into the world's doormat.

13:25.098 --> 13:26.292
Read your Bible.

13:26.333 --> 13:27.493
God has a hell
of a temper.

13:27.534 --> 13:31.061
You piss Him off,
you're up to your
ass in locusts.

13:31.104 --> 13:32.662
Look at Him the wrong
way, pillar of salt.

13:32.706 --> 13:34.833
He's one tough, two-fisted,
gin-joint bouncer

13:34.875 --> 13:37.503
and He made us in
His image.

13:37.544 --> 13:39.876
You know, that's the first thing
I've heard today

13:39.913 --> 13:41.244
that's made any sense.

13:41.281 --> 13:42.043
I know one thing...

13:42.082 --> 13:43.447
that twig boy
can't flunk us

13:43.483 --> 13:45.280
for being constipated
for an hour.

13:45.319 --> 13:47.583
Let's grab a beer.

13:47.621 --> 13:50.181
Thanks, but I need to spend
any spare time

13:50.224 --> 13:51.122
repairing my house

13:51.158 --> 13:52.682
before my idiot neighbor
gets home.

13:52.726 --> 13:55.286
You know, I build dollhouse
furniture for a living.

13:55.329 --> 13:57.854
Maybe I can help out.

14:04.271 --> 14:05.738
Hank Rutherford Hill.

14:05.772 --> 14:07.672
You are within 100 feet of me

14:07.708 --> 14:09.676
and much as I like to scoff
at the law

14:09.710 --> 14:12.304
I also like to
arbitrarily enforce it.

14:12.346 --> 14:13.313
Skedaddle, boy.

14:13.347 --> 14:16.009
We've got a tunnel to dig
under the alley.

14:16.049 --> 14:17.016
What?

14:17.050 --> 14:18.017
Yeah, it's going
to go

14:18.051 --> 14:20.178
from Dale's house to my house
to Boomhauer's house.

14:20.220 --> 14:22.620
Little three-way
friendship tube

14:22.656 --> 14:24.783
and you ain't invited.

14:24.825 --> 14:25.883
The only rules are

14:25.926 --> 14:27.416
no spitting
and no cutting

14:27.461 --> 14:28.553
other people's
fingers off.

14:28.595 --> 14:31.086
You probably wouldn't
like it down there, Hank.

14:31.131 --> 14:34.032
Yeah, man, talkin' 'bout
no dang ol' psychos
allowed, man.

14:34.067 --> 14:36.001
Good God, you're
serious?!

14:36.036 --> 14:38.231
The alley is city
property.

14:38.272 --> 14:39.239
As block captain

14:39.273 --> 14:40.900
I will come down on you

14:40.941 --> 14:43.501
with the full
authority of my office.

14:43.543 --> 14:45.204
And who the hell are you?

14:45.245 --> 14:46.735
Hank, you know
Octavio.

14:46.780 --> 14:48.441
He's my Gal Friday.

14:48.482 --> 14:49.847
Does anything I want.

14:49.883 --> 14:50.850
Now, you, scoot!

14:50.884 --> 14:52.283
100 feet.

14:52.319 --> 14:54.287
Move it.

14:56.189 --> 14:59.750
You shut your god dang mouth,
or I'll shove that ditch witch

14:59.793 --> 15:01.761
down your throat and
dig a tunnel straight

15:01.795 --> 15:03.353
through
to sunshine!

15:03.397 --> 15:05.160
That's telling him.

15:05.198 --> 15:06.165
Felt good, too.

15:06.199 --> 15:10.192
Back off, Hank, or Octavio
will mess you up.

15:10.237 --> 15:12.205
Gribble, I don't care
if he stays or goes.

15:12.239 --> 15:14.537
Where's the money
you owe me, esse?

15:14.574 --> 15:15.666
You heard him.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.677
Take the first
shot, Cochise!

15:17.711 --> 15:18.678
I love two things:

15:18.712 --> 15:21.579
Building dollhouse
furniture and kicking ass!

15:21.615 --> 15:24.015
And I don't see no
dollhouses 'round here.

15:24.051 --> 15:25.882
You see any
dollhouses, Hank?!

15:25.919 --> 15:26.886
No, I don't!

15:26.920 --> 15:28.182
No, you don't!
That's right!

15:28.221 --> 15:30.121
What are you looking at, sport?!

15:30.157 --> 15:31.124
Don't you
eyeball me!

15:31.158 --> 15:33.285
Don’t you eyeball
a junkyard dog!

15:33.327 --> 15:34.294
(barking)

15:34.328 --> 15:35.522
Now you got
the dog barking!

15:35.562 --> 15:36.654
Look, you got
it, you got it!

15:36.697 --> 15:39.530
(barking)

15:39.566 --> 15:45.402
(snarling)

16:03.190 --> 16:03.986
Paramedics said he
got so worked up

16:04.024 --> 16:05.616
he just stroked out.

16:05.659 --> 16:08.628
It was a short period
of suffering

16:08.662 --> 16:12.689
but probably fairly
intense.

16:12.733 --> 16:17.170
Hank, that's exactly
what you look like
when you sleep.

16:18.939 --> 16:19.963
Dang!

16:20.006 --> 16:22.566
No more bouncing that ball!

16:22.609 --> 16:25.942
I'm going
to kick your ass!

16:25.979 --> 16:27.105
You're out of control!

16:27.147 --> 16:28.205
Out of my way, rooster boy.

16:28.248 --> 16:35.654
(yelling)

16:35.689 --> 16:38.590
(grunting and yelping)

16:38.625 --> 16:40.650
HANK:
That could be me
lying there.

16:40.694 --> 16:41.854
It does not have to be, Hank.

16:41.895 --> 16:44.295
You are taking a class
that gives you the tools

16:44.331 --> 16:48.131
to handle your anger.

16:48.168 --> 16:53.162
You love tools.
Go ahead and use them.

16:53.206 --> 16:55.231
BARRY:
I know a lot of you thought

16:55.275 --> 16:57.470
you wouldn't make it
to graduation

16:57.511 --> 16:58.773
but you have.

16:58.812 --> 17:01.542
Well, not all of you.

17:01.581 --> 17:04.550
As much as it pains me,
I have to fail Big Jim.

17:04.584 --> 17:07.246
I mean,
he died of anger.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.686
My hands are tied.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.417
It's diploma time.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.358
Mr. Hill,
congratulations.

17:13.393 --> 17:20.856
Uh, it says "Hink Hall."

17:20.901 --> 17:22.868
You got the "l"
and the "A" mixed up.

17:22.903 --> 17:23.869
This might make it difficult

17:23.904 --> 17:25.872
for me to get
my restraining order lifted.

17:25.906 --> 17:28.396
I'll bet that really steams
your beans, doesn't it "Hink?"

17:28.442 --> 17:31.536
Uh, yeah, yeah.

17:31.578 --> 17:34.638
Hey, you big chowder head,
you spelled my name wrong.

17:34.681 --> 17:35.648
(chuckles)

17:35.682 --> 17:40.119
You’re just a body with
a big bowl of soup on it.

17:40.153 --> 17:41.552
Congrats, man

17:41.588 --> 17:45.183
you passed
the final test.

17:45.225 --> 17:47.193
Next up... Mr. Mangione.

17:47.227 --> 17:51.823
"Chick" Mangione?

17:51.865 --> 17:57.826
I'm not a chick;
I'm a dude!

18:07.981 --> 18:12.441
DALE:
Beer cooler docking complete.

18:12.486 --> 18:13.578
We have beer.

18:13.620 --> 18:14.780
Deploy lips.

18:14.821 --> 18:15.981
What the?

18:16.022 --> 18:19.583
You actually
dug the dang tunnel?!

18:19.626 --> 18:21.992
But I told you...

18:22.028 --> 18:25.691
All right,
easy there, angry bear...

18:25.732 --> 18:26.721
Is that Hank Hill?

18:26.766 --> 18:28.996
You don't sound
100 feet away.

18:29.035 --> 18:30.798
No, gentlemen,
you'll be happy to know

18:30.837 --> 18:33.635
that I am certified
anger-free.

18:33.673 --> 18:35.334
Now that the restraining order's
been lifted

18:35.375 --> 18:37.104
what do you say you guys
take a break

18:37.143 --> 18:39.907
from that dark tunnel,
and enjoy a cold beer

18:39.946 --> 18:41.538
up here in the sunny alley.

18:41.581 --> 18:42.946
DALE:
Don't waste time

18:42.983 --> 18:44.280
talking to him.

18:44.317 --> 18:47.150
We got to dig a place
to put our empties.

19:02.602 --> 19:04.433
Uh, fellas, you might
want to get out of there.

19:04.471 --> 19:06.564
You see, there's
a garbage truck coming.

19:06.606 --> 19:08.699
They weigh about five tons

19:08.742 --> 19:10.937
and your last tunnel
couldn't support me

19:10.977 --> 19:12.239
on an empty stomach.

19:12.279 --> 19:13.746
No time to gab, Hank.

19:13.780 --> 19:15.304
We got bigger
fish to fry.

19:15.348 --> 19:19.250
The game, gentlemen,
is Crazy Eights.

19:19.286 --> 19:21.516
Come on, please. I'm serious!

19:21.555 --> 19:23.648
Sorry, I don't
speak"Surface."

19:23.690 --> 19:29.651
Okay, look.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.964
My idiot friends
rented a ditch witch

19:36.002 --> 19:37.970
and they're in the tunnel
under the alley.

19:38.004 --> 19:38.971
So if you drive
over there

19:39.005 --> 19:40.973
you'll probably
crush 'em to death.

19:41.007 --> 19:42.975
Buddy, I used to be
just like you...

19:43.009 --> 19:43.976
drinking, hanging
around alleys

19:44.010 --> 19:45.978
making up stories
just to get attention.

19:46.012 --> 19:48.412
Get it together.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.849
Oh, gosh, dang it.

19:51.885 --> 19:54.581
Pet the cat, pet the cat...

19:54.621 --> 19:56.714
Come on, guys,
please get out of there.

19:56.756 --> 19:58.087
Watch the anger.

19:58.124 --> 20:00.092
You don’t want to end up
like Big Jim.

20:00.126 --> 20:01.093
Remember? He's dead.

20:01.127 --> 20:05.496
That's because Big Jim
had an anger problem.

20:05.532 --> 20:06.499
This is different.

20:06.533 --> 20:07.591
I have an idiot problem.

20:07.634 --> 20:13.197
Uh, guys... come on, get out.

20:20.780 --> 20:23.044
Get out, get out, get out!

20:23.083 --> 20:25.551
If you don't get out
of that god'dang rathole now

20:25.585 --> 20:27.917
I'll get my circular saw,
come down there

20:27.954 --> 20:30.479

your fingers and toes!

20:30.523 --> 20:33.458
Now move! Move! Move!

20:42.335 --> 20:44.803
Okay, Hank, now that
we're out of the tunnel

20:44.838 --> 20:46.430

20:46.473 --> 20:49.567

20:49.609 --> 20:53.978

20:55.015 --> 20:56.539
BILL:

all those

20:56.583 --> 20:58.551
Whataburger wrappers
off my lawn

20:58.585 --> 20:59.779
just like you
told me to.

20:59.819 --> 21:02.344
It’s just my little
way of saying thank you

21:02.389 --> 21:03.378
for losing your temper.

21:03.423 --> 21:06.358
And to show you that
we're best buds again

21:06.393 --> 21:09.191
I'm going to connect our
houses with a rope bridge.

21:09.229 --> 21:11.857

21:11.898 --> 21:14.230
