<i>We've located one male
and one female. We're heading in.</i>

01:08.577 --> 01:10.312
<i>- Move, move!
- Come on, it's not safe. Let's go.</i>

01:10.396 --> 01:13.455
<i>It's restricted area, sir.
We're getting you out of here now.</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:28.753
That's my theme song.

01:29.253 --> 01:32.671
- Everybody needs a theme song.
- How far are we from base?

01:32.796 --> 01:36.339
I don't know.
We probably got another 20...

01:36.880 --> 01:38.838
<i>2-5, do you copy that?</i>

01:41.134 --> 01:42.550
Help me!

01:43.425 --> 01:46.844
Somebody help?
HELP!

01:49.759 --> 01:51.205
Requesting permission to engage.

01:51.206 --> 01:53.806
Romeo, are you clear
to take him down, over?

01:56.845 --> 01:59.597
I need airstrike,
I'm giving you the coordinates now!

01:59.889 --> 02:02.642
- Airstrike!
- Help!

02:03.475 --> 02:05.575
<i>It's gonna be much worse
on collateral damage...</i>

02:05.576 --> 02:07.576
<i>than if we get them
with the airfire, over.</i>

02:17.686 --> 02:20.939
- Airstrike cover!
- Somebody help?

02:22.730 --> 02:25.056
<i>- Copy. Are you clear to engage?
- Take him down.</i>

02:25.057 --> 02:29.025
<i>- Let's do it.
- In three, two, one.</i>

02:45.723 --> 02:47.049
Excuse me?

02:48.657 --> 02:50.367
You know where they took
the injured?

02:51.068 --> 02:52.868
- Uh... speak English?
- No.

02:52.874 --> 02:56.693
- You speak English? Speak English, anybody?
- Yeah, little English.

02:56.894 --> 02:58.894
The entrance
is very dangerous, sir.

02:58.909 --> 03:00.722
Where did they take
those injured thousand?

03:00.723 --> 03:01.923
- Over there.
- Where?

03:01.924 --> 03:03.171
- Over there.
- The hospital?

03:03.172 --> 03:04.713
- Yeah.
- Which hospital?

03:34.008 --> 03:37.173
Wait here, okay?
Five minutes.

03:41.634 --> 03:43.194
So, all the people from the hotel...

03:43.195 --> 03:47.495
the hotel, they brought them in,
like last night, or... or this morning?

03:50.097 --> 03:54.783
S... Sam. Samantha Wynden?
With, uh... yellows...

03:56.284 --> 03:58.284
Wynden...
I found her.

03:58.875 --> 04:01.175
She is over there...

04:01.176 --> 04:02.849
She's down here?

04:20.190 --> 04:24.609
- Sam?
- Yeah?

04:26.568 --> 04:30.068
My name's Andrew Kaulder.
I work for your fathers publication.

04:30.193 --> 04:34.446
They wanted me to come by here
and make sure you're okay.

04:34.487 --> 04:38.823
- So... is that broken?
- No.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.409
All right.
So... you're okay?

04:43.718 --> 04:45.190
Yeah.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.510
Okay.
Good.

04:57.369 --> 05:00.490
<i>- What is this an ultimatum?
- Ultimatim? No, you're overreacting.</i>

05:00.515 --> 05:03.581
Overreacting? I've been waiting
three years for this.

05:03.949 --> 05:07.581
<i>Look Kaulder, this is the bosses daughter.
I need you to get her outta there.</i>

05:07.606 --> 05:10.184
<i>What is the big deal?
Just do this for me.</i>

05:10.334 --> 05:11.861
This is my big chance.

05:11.862 --> 05:14.062
This is what we've been talking about.
This is what I've been waiting for.

05:14.143 --> 05:15.469
<i>Look, just take her to the coast.</i>

05:15.470 --> 05:17.870
<i>You'll be back today.
That is all I'm asking you to do.</i>

05:17.878 --> 05:21.289
<i>- Pearce, the answer is no.
- No, no, you can't say no!</i>

06:30.531 --> 06:32.846
<i>I'm fine, dad.
It's not as bad as it looks.</i>

06:32.871 --> 06:35.933
<i>- Well, on a TV it looks bad.
- Well then don't watch TV, dad.</i>

06:36.625 --> 06:39.452
<i>Customers travelling
towards the infected zones...</i>

06:39.453 --> 06:41.653
<i>are advised to check
train destination...</i>

06:41.660 --> 06:43.292
- Is the train to the coast still running?
- Yes.

06:43.376 --> 06:46.245
- Two tickets.
- Two Americans?

06:46.285 --> 06:49.764
<i>Well, I'm glad you're okay.
But, uh... did you called John?</i>

06:51.289 --> 06:52.614
<i>Sam?</i>

06:57.590 --> 07:01.459
<i>Sam, he's your fianceé.
You can call him now.</i>

07:01.794 --> 07:05.458
<i>- Dad, the train is here. I gotta go.
- You can't just call him now?</i>

07:05.583 --> 07:08.710
If I don't hang up right now, I'm not
gonna make it back. Please.

07:08.752 --> 07:10.861
All right, Sam. Get off the phone.
The train is leaving. Let's go.

07:10.885 --> 07:13.471
<i>- Dad, I gotta go.
- Sam, is this the guy?</i>

07:13.521 --> 07:14.739
- Dad, we have to go.
- Come on.

07:14.863 --> 07:16.073
- Put him on.
- Hang up the phone, we gotta go.

07:16.074 --> 07:17.574
He wants to talk tou you.

07:19.298 --> 07:22.465
- I don't wanna talk to him.
- Here he is, Dad.

07:22.881 --> 07:25.550
- What are you doing?
- It's for you.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.629
<i>- Mr. Wynden.
- Yes.</i>

07:28.630 --> 07:30.030
<i>- Good morning.
- What's your name?</i>

07:30.095 --> 07:31.136
Andrew Kaulder.

07:31.145 --> 07:32.837
I'm a photographer.
I work for your public...

07:32.838 --> 07:36.138
<i>Kaulder, listen to me, you do understand
your responsibility here, don't you?</i>

07:36.211 --> 07:37.211
Yes, sir.

07:37.236 --> 07:39.183
<i>That's my little girl you have there,
you know?</i>

07:39.184 --> 07:41.584
Yes, sir, I understand.
She's in safe hands.

07:41.607 --> 07:44.851
<i>You're gonna get her back home safe.
Promise me!</i>

07:45.767 --> 07:47.257
Yes, sir!

07:49.391 --> 07:51.434
- We gotta go.
- Sir, we need to get on the train.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.559
<i>- The train's leaving.
- Okay. Well, look after her.</i>

07:53.626 --> 07:55.855
<i>- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.</i>

07:55.981 --> 07:57.736
Jeez, come on.

08:13.693 --> 08:18.278
You... photographing these things?

08:18.445 --> 08:21.737
I've photographed quite a bit
of them. Mostly carcasses.

08:21.863 --> 08:28.116
I'm trying to get a shot
that would make your dads frontpage.

08:34.784 --> 08:41.034
- That's better.
- So you came down here on work? Vacation?

08:44.571 --> 08:49.367
- Do you work?
- Do I look like I don't work? Or something?

08:49.458 --> 08:54.917
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
Just due to this whole babysitting thing.

08:55.459 --> 08:57.642
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.795
It's okay.
Glad I could help.

09:00.980 --> 09:03.086
It's so hot in this thing.

10:07.860 --> 10:11.479
He said there's a problem up ahead
and if they could turn around and go back.

10:11.903 --> 10:15.031
- Should we stay on the train?
- No.

10:24.117 --> 10:26.676
Kaulder, are you sure
it's safe to get off here?

10:27.677 --> 10:30.377
Yeah, sure.
We're quite a few miles from the zone.

10:30.752 --> 10:32.193
- All right, let's get off.
- It's really cold.

10:32.194 --> 10:33.594
Get off. Get off.
Get off.

10:37.089 --> 10:39.545
Are you sure about this?
The train's gonna leave.

10:39.630 --> 10:42.006
It doesn't matter.
We need to keep going.

10:50.642 --> 10:54.160
Kaulder, where you going?
There's nothing here.

10:58.879 --> 11:01.754
- Excuse me?
- Kaulder, just let me speak to her.

11:01.755 --> 11:05.255
Excuse me,
we are a little bid lost?

11:09.156 --> 11:12.056
I can't see to good
because it's night.

11:13.385 --> 11:17.176
So, she said, where still over
100 km's from the coast.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.803
And the tracks are damaged
and we can't continue by train.

11:21.094 --> 11:22.895
Can we not get to a bus
or something?

11:22.996 --> 11:25.096
Can we walk along here...

11:25.097 --> 11:27.597
- on the rail-road tracks
- No.

11:28.307 --> 11:32.066
No one here travels at night
because of the creatures.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.258
So, we'll have to get a ride tomorrow.

11:34.859 --> 11:37.859
Right now it's not much traffic,
not to much.

11:37.893 --> 11:43.095
She said, there, there's almost
no traffic in here because...

11:43.178 --> 11:46.589
the military are closing this whole
coastline in two days.

11:46.780 --> 11:48.156
So let me get this straight.

11:48.157 --> 11:51.357
If we don't make it over to the coast
within the next 48 hours...

11:51.440 --> 11:53.505
she's gonna be stuck here
for about six months?

11:53.806 --> 12:00.506
If we don't get there in 3 days
we're gonna be stuck here?

12:00.507 --> 12:01.507
Yes.

12:12.824 --> 12:16.431
The coffee has been stirred.
You can't stir it anymore.

12:39.001 --> 12:43.982
No, we're not married. No.
I'm single. Single.

12:47.191 --> 12:50.146
Single, yeah.
Can you say single?

12:52.920 --> 12:56.797
<i>The U.S. attacks across
the border near the infected zone,</i>

12:56.821 --> 13:00.732
<i>as you well know, have started
much earlier than last season.</i>

13:00.814 --> 13:04.301
<i>Taking many people by surprise.
Sightings outside the usual migrations...</i>

13:04.509 --> 13:06.159
<i>have already increased.</i>

13:06.160 --> 13:09.260
<i>And although there's been several
airstrikes already by the U.S.</i>

13:09.584 --> 13:14.319
<i>The new president especially says he would
not tolerate any activity near the border...</i>

13:14.402 --> 13:16.904
<i>and nearly build a wall on the U.S. border.</i>

13:16.905 --> 13:19.505
<i>Which of course
brings us all back to concern...</i>

13:33.536 --> 13:37.496
Put on the mask. I'm gonna
take a picture. Put on the mask.

13:38.005 --> 13:41.520
Like when the plane's come.
Yes, yes.

13:42.023 --> 13:44.441
You don't have to breathe hard.

13:48.850 --> 13:49.942
Thank you.

13:50.124 --> 13:53.424
- No I can't...
- Yes, take it really.

13:53.425 --> 13:56.444
- She wants me to take this stuff.
- Well, then grab it. Let's go.

13:56.469 --> 14:00.295
- What is it?
- Food and water. Many thanks.

14:01.496 --> 14:03.796
- Have a very good trip.
- Thank you.

14:04.004 --> 14:06.815
- Thank you... Bye now.
- Same to you.

14:07.016 --> 14:08.016
Sam.

14:09.866 --> 14:12.541
Let's go! Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

14:18.376 --> 14:21.787
- So you're married?
- No, I'm engaged.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.680
What's the difference?

14:39.568 --> 14:41.086
Oh, that feels good!

14:46.727 --> 14:49.673
Walking.
Kaulder.

14:49.839 --> 14:52.799
- What is your name?
- René.

14:54.215 --> 14:56.299
How are you?
I like your hat.

15:15.222 --> 15:19.210
- So, what, like, uh... 5 more minutes?
- Yeah.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.211
Yes?

15:25.026 --> 15:28.107
- You guys got any creatures around here?
- No.

15:28.150 --> 15:29.610
Not even a little ones.

15:29.611 --> 15:30.611
We used to.

15:30.821 --> 15:33.320
- Where'd they attack before?
- Right over there.

15:33.569 --> 15:37.321
- Yeah, something like three years ago?
- Gonna be a new one too?

15:37.411 --> 15:40.305
No? You were just a baby back then,
weren't you?

15:40.406 --> 15:41.906
I'm gonna take your picture, yeah?

15:47.989 --> 15:49.531
Doesn't that kinda bother you,

15:50.137 --> 15:53.865
that you need something bad
to happen to profit from it?

15:55.640 --> 15:56.925
You mean like a doctor?

16:00.198 --> 16:04.592
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean. Come on.

16:19.537 --> 16:20.644
Let me ask you something?

16:22.118 --> 16:24.205
You know how much money
your fathers company pays...

16:24.331 --> 16:26.846
for a picture of a child
killed by a creature?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.805
50,000 dollars.

16:30.854 --> 16:33.774
You know how much money I get
paid for a picture of a happy child?

16:35.272 --> 16:36.424
Nothing.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.673
You know where that puts me?

16:43.314 --> 16:45.091
Photographing tragedy.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.359
I don't cause it.

16:53.743 --> 16:59.319
I'm just documenting it.
Everyone has to earn a living.

17:22.423 --> 17:24.557
- We were too late?
- No.

17:25.073 --> 17:27.056
They're still letting boats through.

17:27.365 --> 17:30.591
They're just patrolling because behind
the fence is the infected zone.

17:45.637 --> 17:47.753
Is there anymore ferry tickets today?

17:47.754 --> 17:49.554
- The office of...
- Tickets.

17:49.555 --> 17:53.055
- It's over there.
- Thank you.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.156
Hello?

17:56.597 --> 17:58.672
- Ferry ticket?
- Back there.

17:58.697 --> 18:00.515
- It's closed.
- Yeah, it's closed now.

18:00.848 --> 18:02.140
It's closed. Is there anymore?

18:02.141 --> 18:03.741
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

18:19.624 --> 18:20.919
- English?
- Yes, sir.

18:20.920 --> 18:24.320
Uh... we want ticket to...
ferry ticket to America.

18:24.377 --> 18:25.511
Let me check.

18:25.712 --> 18:27.712
Are there any tickets
right now?

18:28.968 --> 18:30.727
Uh... not for today,
for tomorrow.

18:30.728 --> 18:32.028
- What time?
- What time?

18:32.036 --> 18:33.086
Seven o'clock in the morning.

18:33.087 --> 18:34.487
- Last ferry?
- That's the last ferry.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.588
Okay, we'll get them.

18:36.713 --> 18:40.821
- Uh... how much?
- That would be 5,000 dollars.

18:41.145 --> 18:43.289
- 5,000?
- Yeah, yeah. 5,000.

18:45.313 --> 18:49.099
- Yeah, it's the only way to go.
- 5,000 dollars is a lot of money.

18:49.124 --> 18:51.532
Yes I know, but it's the only
possibility right now.

18:51.649 --> 18:55.025
How do you not have tickets?
There are people waiting in line.

18:55.107 --> 18:58.107
Yeah, the people's just waiting
to go through the land.

18:58.233 --> 18:59.349
What do you mean by land?

18:59.391 --> 19:02.776
These people are going through the infected
zone as you can see there.

19:03.401 --> 19:07.710
Infected zone is very risky. If you
have the money you go by ferry.

19:09.319 --> 19:13.276
Do you have the money?
Do you take a risk?

19:15.569 --> 19:18.038
No, no, no, she doesn't need to go
through the zone.

19:18.039 --> 19:19.339
I wanna put her on the ferry.

19:19.821 --> 19:23.029
All right? She's American.
She has a passport. Yeah?

19:23.153 --> 19:26.115
- Oh, that makes a difference.
- That's me.

19:26.197 --> 19:27.613
Look at that picture.
It's pretty.

19:27.814 --> 19:29.014
- Beautiful.
- Thanks.

19:29.946 --> 19:32.449
- 2,000.
- No, it would be 5,000.

19:32.533 --> 19:33.782
But it's the only option you got.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.423
Tomorrow at seven o'clock
you take it, or you go with them.

19:36.447 --> 19:40.290
- I'll give you 3,000 dollars.
- No. No way. It's 5,000.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.800
That's 5,000.

19:45.368 --> 19:48.319
- But you are safe.
- All right.

19:51.036 --> 19:53.785
- Thank you.
- Don't you spend that all on one place.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.285
- I feel very happy about that.
- Mh-hm.

19:57.394 --> 19:58.521
What a joke.

19:59.122 --> 20:01.522
If he owns the hotels here too,
we're fucked.

20:05.286 --> 20:09.255
- I could have a shower.
- A shower?

20:10.622 --> 20:14.406
Yeah, well, I have to say, thanks
to you I'm stuck by the zone tonight.

20:14.432 --> 20:17.798
So, if I don't get any award winning
photographs here,

20:17.799 --> 20:20.399
then I'm gonna make you
get me 5 shots of tequila.

20:20.664 --> 20:21.764
Five shots.

20:21.765 --> 20:23.866
- The only way to go.
- Are you kidding?

20:23.867 --> 20:26.891
No. It's the safest way.
Five shots of tequila.

20:26.958 --> 20:29.758
- I'll pay you two.
- No. The price is five.

20:29.983 --> 20:31.910
Okay three,
that's my final offer.

20:38.794 --> 20:44.002
Looks like they gave you the
honeymoon suite. That mine is a shithole.

20:44.712 --> 20:45.602
So?

20:45.669 --> 20:48.995
Mind if I grab a glass of water
while my room's getting ready?

20:51.548 --> 20:56.214
<i>All around the Western perimeter
and seem to be massing for an assault.</i>

20:56.338 --> 21:00.922
<i>In eleven different locations attack.
Three of them as we speak...</i>

21:02.840 --> 21:05.550
Ice cold water.

21:13.134 --> 21:15.009
That is really cold.

21:15.257 --> 21:20.152
I stink! I really need a bath.
That's what I need.

21:20.926 --> 21:24.652
- Want me to scrub your back?
- Shut up.

21:26.384 --> 21:30.219
<i>especially when the migration
is driven by seasonal change.</i>

21:30.304 --> 21:34.679
<i>Scientist say that more than one hundred
migrate at this time of year.</i>

21:34.680 --> 21:35.971
<i>What ever you call them,</i>

21:35.972 --> 21:37.372
<i>- their population...
- Should we, uh...</i>

21:37.373 --> 21:38.473
should we grab a cocktail?

21:39.512 --> 21:42.554
- It's gonna be dark, so we should...
- Yeah, we'll look.

21:42.637 --> 21:46.708
It's fine. This town isn't gonna get hit
for another two days.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.807
No, but isn't that kinda like the weatherman
who says it's not gonna rain,

21:49.889 --> 21:52.724
- and then all of a sudden it rains?
- The Meteorologist?

21:52.932 --> 21:56.683
This guy that lived next door to me
when I was attempting to go to college.

21:56.807 --> 21:58.518
A big "stoner".

21:58.726 --> 22:02.517
His name was Joel. I was like
"Joel, what are you doing?"

22:02.643 --> 22:05.160
He said: "Well, I'm working to be
Meteorologist".

22:05.184 --> 22:10.687
"That's the only job that I can be wrong
every day and not get fired".

22:11.561 --> 22:13.761
Joel, he had wife.

22:14.145 --> 22:16.729
You could just tell that
she was gonna leave him.

22:16.853 --> 22:20.755
One of those couples you look at
that there just destined for failure.

22:37.524 --> 22:42.234
<i>On Monday we told you about the efforts
to sure up secuirty at the nations ports.</i>

22:42.358 --> 22:46.151
<i>And government says great strikes
have been made. But critic contend...</i>

22:46.567 --> 22:52.111
<i>that crossing in and out of the infected
zone are potentially very poorish.</i>

23:03.403 --> 23:07.538
<i>Hi, Mommy and Daddy aren't in
so leave a message.</i>

23:07.863 --> 23:12.530
Hey, buddy, it's me. I just wanted
to call to wish you a happy birthday.

23:12.615 --> 23:17.157
I'm not gonna be able to call you
tomorrow, so, happy birthday bud.

23:17.325 --> 23:23.199
And I promise, I'll call you in a couple
of weeks when I land somewhere. OK?

23:27.284 --> 23:28.343
Who was that?

23:28.444 --> 23:31.144
That was reception.
They just said my room is ready.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.260
Oh, that's good.

23:40.076 --> 23:43.211
That means you can get out now
so I can put my dirty clothes back on.

23:43.661 --> 23:46.088
I was just gonna lay here for...

23:50.163 --> 23:51.530
All right.

23:53.372 --> 23:55.397
So we'll meet outside in like, a...

23:55.398 --> 23:57.498
- half an hour?
- Thanks.

24:04.633 --> 24:06.467
You gotta do it right
before you can do it.

24:06.568 --> 24:07.868
You just copy that.

24:08.033 --> 24:10.765
Oh, my God. That's really great.

24:58.393 --> 25:00.019
The vibe just changed.

26:03.364 --> 26:05.178
Look at all these people.

26:09.246 --> 26:12.625
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

26:14.598 --> 26:16.074
You wanna get outta here?

26:48.738 --> 26:54.155
- So what're you gonna do tomorrow?
- I wanna go home to my fianceé.

26:54.489 --> 26:57.741
Get married, and live happily
ever after.

26:58.291 --> 27:01.157
You're gonna have a lot more fun
tomorrow than I'm having.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.443
When are you guys getting married?

27:10.134 --> 27:12.443
I don't know. We haven't set a date.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.553
- We'll celebrate now.
- Cheers.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.054
Cheers.

27:22.354 --> 27:24.036
<i>Stop the bombing!</i>

27:30.396 --> 27:32.048
<i>Stop the bombing!</i>

27:34.297 --> 27:37.805
You know, dolphins can only hold their
breath for like, 12 minutes.

27:37.905 --> 27:44.923
So the question is: When they sleep do they
swim? Or do they just stake a put and float?

27:45.800 --> 27:50.034
- Have you ever? Did you know that?
- Did I know what?

27:50.792 --> 27:55.059
That dolphins can only hold their
breath for like, 12 minutes.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.819
- No.
- They're mammals.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.553
So you mean,
they have bellybuttons?

28:02.295 --> 28:08.711
They, they... they do have bellybuttons.
You're a marine biologist, aren't you?

28:09.485 --> 28:12.556
That's what you do.
You look like a marine biologist.

28:13.556 --> 28:16.496
Biologist.
That's a weird word.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.755
- How's your hand?
- It's the same.

28:19.956 --> 28:20.956
Yeah...

28:21.172 --> 28:23.440
Sounds like they're having a party.

28:24.122 --> 28:29.067
On top of that, my airconditioning is broken
in my room. So you know... I don't know...

28:30.017 --> 28:31.950
That's a king-size.

28:34.534 --> 28:38.717
- Gonna lie down in the bed? No?
- Well on that note.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.335
- You want a massage?
- No.

28:41.401 --> 28:45.302
I'm just kidding. Just kidding.
I don't know.

28:45.711 --> 28:47.835
All right, so
you don't wanna make out.

28:51.585 --> 28:54.846
- I had a really good time.
- Yeah, I did too.

28:56.005 --> 28:59.087
I mean, hanging out on top of a
400 year old church...

28:59.088 --> 29:02.679
is what I do on the weekends all the time
but it was different doing it with you.

29:06.997 --> 29:10.174
- I gotta go to bed.
- All right.

29:11.057 --> 29:15.375
- See you in the morning?
- Yeah, see you in the morning.

29:18.499 --> 29:20.117
Sure you're okay in here?

29:22.193 --> 29:24.661
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:25.694 --> 29:29.676
- Is that a creature in there?
- Good night.

29:36.295 --> 29:39.895
Who wants tequila, on me?
Anybody?

29:40.728 --> 29:45.639
No, that's more for me.
More for me.

29:48.072 --> 29:53.940
<i>Locating the male in the endless darkness
can be the hardest of journey of all.</i>

29:54.148 --> 29:57.857
<i>Each year the female releases
chemicals into the water,</i>

29:57.983 --> 30:01.939
<i>the male can sense from over
a hundred miles away.</i>

30:02.532 --> 30:07.481

30:32.014 --> 30:33.856
<i>- Hi, this is John.
- Hello?</i>

30:33.939 --> 30:36.130
<i>I'm not here right now but if
you like to leave a message...</i>

30:36.131 --> 30:38.380
<i>and your number,
I'll call you right back.</i>

30:56.578 --> 30:59.711
<i>Attention passengers! Police indicate
there will be restrictions.</i>

30:59.736 --> 31:01.603
<i>The harbor will be closing in one hour.</i>

31:45.502 --> 31:49.226
Good morning.
You look great.

31:49.293 --> 31:53.271
- Did you sleep good?
- Yeah. How about you? Good?

31:56.171 --> 32:00.089
So, I was just wondering if you wanted
to get a cup of coffee, before I left?

32:00.173 --> 32:02.882
Yeah, sure I could use a cup of coffee.

32:03.248 --> 32:08.090
Just let me, uh... get my wallet
and put some pants on.

32:08.782 --> 32:12.350
I gotta clean up in here just affecting.
If you can just give me a sec.

32:12.450 --> 32:14.568
You know, it's, uh... it's okay.

32:14.769 --> 32:17.069
- I'm gonna be late.
- No, hang on.

32:17.151 --> 32:19.042
No, it's okay. Really.

32:19.551 --> 32:23.034
- It's all right, don't worry about it.
- Sam? Sam?

32:24.151 --> 32:26.588
Come on.
Are you kidding me?

32:29.412 --> 32:31.403
Sam? Sam!

32:37.303 --> 32:38.437
Sam?

32:39.497 --> 32:40.681
Sam?

32:43.207 --> 32:44.372
What're you doing?

32:46.398 --> 32:50.388
- Trying to get on the boat.
- No, I mean, what're you doing?

32:52.865 --> 32:54.425
I'm going home.

32:59.382 --> 33:03.517
- All right so, so that's it?
- Yeah.

33:06.787 --> 33:08.793
What're you waiting for?
Get on the boat.

33:10.370 --> 33:11.501
I can't.

33:13.002 --> 33:14.602
What do you mean
you can't get on the boat?

33:16.436 --> 33:18.360
You have my passport.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.175
Excuse me?

33:39.358 --> 33:43.082
That girl...
No, you don't know?

34:21.674 --> 34:27.543
I got robbed. So all I want is to get one
ticket for her on the ferry back to America.

34:27.559 --> 34:29.924
- That's not my problem.
- I know it's not your problem.

34:29.949 --> 34:31.733
I'm just asking you to help
me out here.

34:31.817 --> 34:34.009
As you can see, look,
everything is closed.

34:34.632 --> 34:37.321
The army's out there.
The navy's out there.

34:37.522 --> 34:39.822
Yesterday you had all the possibilities,
today not possible...

34:39.846 --> 34:42.520
- Yesterday I paid you 5,000 dollars.
- That was yesterday.

34:42.521 --> 34:45.493
- Yesterday I paid you 5,000 dollars...
- That was yesterday...

34:45.494 --> 34:47.396
- today is not possible.
- What do you mean there's no possible.

34:47.478 --> 34:49.012
You tell me there's
no more ferries here?

34:49.112 --> 34:50.552
Okay, what about by land?

34:51.452 --> 34:52.889
You wanna go to the infected zone?

34:52.889 --> 34:53.889
- No.
- Yes.

34:54.014 --> 34:56.763
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes, I do.

34:56.987 --> 35:00.732
I just wanna get home. If that's
the only way I'll be happy to go.

35:00.756 --> 35:03.281
It's going to be more expensive
I need to hire some people.

35:03.282 --> 35:05.482
I need to pay for a driver.

35:05.783 --> 35:07.683
I need money...

35:08.384 --> 35:12.284
- to pay the officials
- That's fine.

35:12.285 --> 35:16.485
Hire a riverboat
and a crew.

35:16.486 --> 35:22.586
And most inportant for your safety
armed guards to escort you to the border.

35:22.677 --> 35:25.804
Very difficult journey, very risky,
very dangerous.

35:25.829 --> 35:26.802
Come on, man.

35:26.803 --> 35:29.361
- And that's not cheap of course.
- That's fine. How much?

35:29.729 --> 35:32.502
Oh, that'll be about 10.000 dollars.

35:34.971 --> 35:37.072
We got robbed, okay?
We don't have any money.

35:37.073 --> 35:38.262
That's your problem...

35:38.263 --> 35:40.039
No, no, no, listen,
listen, listen.

35:40.215 --> 35:43.897
That's fine.
Look, my dad has money.

35:43.996 --> 35:45.790
Well, show me,
you really can afford that.

35:45.991 --> 35:48.391
He has lots of money.

35:48.449 --> 35:51.132
The money is not here,
I want it here, cash now.

35:51.133 --> 35:54.617
Come on, man. I'll give you my watch.
I'll give you this. I'll pay you double.

35:54.700 --> 35:57.467
I will pay you double.
I will give this and I pay you double.

35:57.550 --> 35:59.916
Both of you don't make enough money
to pay the tickets.

36:00.043 --> 36:01.444
I'll pay you when we
get back to America.

36:01.527 --> 36:05.250
When you get back to America?
Come on! How can I assure that?

36:05.943 --> 36:08.436
I don't know you.
This is no worth.

36:08.461 --> 36:10.911
I know it's no good.
Okay, but what would you do?

36:10.935 --> 36:12.435
- No options, no possibility.
- No option?!

36:12.436 --> 36:14.480
If you were in my situation
what would you do?

36:14.505 --> 36:18.012
- Get the money and pay.
- Fucking work with me here, man.

36:18.038 --> 36:21.722
- No. It's not good enough.
- So you got nothing for me?

36:21.747 --> 36:22.989
It's not good enough.

36:23.590 --> 36:24.890
And this?

36:33.090 --> 36:35.074
- It's a diamond.
- Diamond?

36:35.075 --> 36:36.175
Diamond.

36:38.076 --> 36:39.876
It's worth more then 20,000.

36:40.702 --> 36:43.583
For that... two tickets.

36:44.292 --> 36:47.850
Two people, me and her.
I go with her.

37:00.036 --> 37:01.129
Okay.

37:55.230 --> 37:56.530
Where is Victor?

38:21.929 --> 38:24.129
They lost their passports.

38:24.530 --> 38:28.430
They are here to study
the creatures.

38:29.931 --> 38:32.731
Where is Victor?
I arranged this with him.

38:33.530 --> 38:37.606
- No, no, no passport, I'm sorry.
- We're aid workers.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.407
Where is Victor?
This was all arranged.

38:39.408 --> 38:40.408
Victor?

38:41.409 --> 38:43.509
- Victor, do you know this man?
- It's okay.

38:45.010 --> 38:46.910
It's okay,
let them through.

38:50.433 --> 38:53.501
They can't... there's nothing...
nobody can't stop us. You sure?

38:53.602 --> 38:54.602
Yeah.

39:33.375 --> 39:35.775
That's not enough,
this close to the season.

39:35.776 --> 39:38.776
- They're the last ones.
- It's too dangerous.

39:43.076 --> 39:45.918
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I can't hear him.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.919
Okay, but I'm not
grossing the border.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.620
- No way for that.
- Okay.

39:53.021 --> 39:54.921
- Okay
- Okay, yes.

39:54.922 --> 39:56.022
Let's go.

39:59.322 --> 40:00.922
- Yeah?
- We're ready.

40:01.471 --> 40:05.371
- That's Juan, he'll take you to the border.
- Nice to meet you.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.472
This is the other person.
And that's Juan...

40:08.473 --> 40:10.773
who'll take you
to the border now.

40:10.872 --> 40:12.339
Where are the other people?

40:12.340 --> 40:14.140
Come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry.

40:14.141 --> 40:16.941
There's not much time,
that's Juan, go now.

40:17.065 --> 40:19.476
- You're not coming?
- No, no, no.

40:19.477 --> 40:23.077
Go now,
Come on.

40:23.478 --> 40:25.278
- See you later.
- Oh, okay.

41:50.968 --> 41:52.284
Kaulder, wake up.

41:57.917 --> 42:00.321
That's it?
We're here?

42:00.722 --> 42:01.722
What are we doing?

42:02.223 --> 42:03.823
We need to get gas.

42:04.962 --> 42:07.387
- What'd he say?
- Gas.

42:08.396 --> 42:10.763
I have to go to the bathroom.
It's been hours.

42:16.663 --> 42:18.397
Go behind that white building.

42:53.418 --> 42:54.646
What is that?

43:31.237 --> 43:34.476
Come on.
Let's get back on the boat.

43:37.296 --> 43:38.629
Come on, Sam.

44:01.066 --> 44:05.202
- What's your sons name?
- Tommy. Turns 6 years old tomorrow.

44:05.469 --> 44:07.241
Tomorrow? Wow.

44:09.151 --> 44:12.693
- What happened with you and the mother?
- Katie?

44:16.213 --> 44:17.469
Nothing.

44:18.695 --> 44:23.979
I met her about... 6 years ago.
We had a great two months together.

44:27.129 --> 44:31.615
Had a blast. Two years later
I got a phone call,

44:31.839 --> 44:33.855
she said: "you got a kid".

44:35.139 --> 44:38.746
I said: "well, can I see him?"
She goes, you can see him...

44:41.665 --> 44:43.432
but you're not his father.

44:58.579 --> 45:00.585
Well, on a lighter note.
Do you have any pets?

45:03.121 --> 45:07.005
- No. No, I don't.
- You have no pets?

45:08.789 --> 45:13.222
- My fiancé is allergic.
- Oh, man, that sucks!

46:15.970 --> 46:20.470
- Wait, I see something.
- What do you see?

46:20.971 --> 46:22.371
What do you see?

46:40.271 --> 46:42.857
Kaulder, come on.
You can stop taking pictures.

46:43.232 --> 46:46.707
- What you want me to do?
- Are you looking at...?

46:46.732 --> 46:48.057
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

46:51.171 --> 46:52.968
What is that?
What is it?

47:41.018 --> 47:42.284
What is that?

47:42.785 --> 47:43.685
Whoa...

47:51.886 --> 47:54.386
- What're you doing with that?
- Grab the line.

48:01.639 --> 48:04.279
Hurry! Go, go, go,
go, go, go!

50:14.787 --> 50:15.898
Why are we stopping?

50:15.899 --> 50:18.099
You continue by land
with my friends.

50:19.455 --> 50:21.055
Amigos?
- They're my friends,

50:21.056 --> 50:22.789
Amigos? Those guys have guns.

50:23.137 --> 50:24.137
Have guns.

50:24.138 --> 50:26.483
- Those Amigos are friends.
- Those are your friends?

50:33.916 --> 50:37.075
- He said that we're safe.
- Why do they have guns?

50:37.176 --> 50:38.676
Did you ask that?

50:38.709 --> 50:41.944
He said that we have to hurry
before the daylight's gone.

50:47.017 --> 50:48.510
- He's just told us to hurry...
- Shh...

50:55.911 --> 50:58.811
It's okay, it's okay,
it's only a cow.

51:00.379 --> 51:03.005
- What did he say?
- He said it was just a cow.

51:03.839 --> 51:06.471
It's the cows.
Of course.

51:20.358 --> 51:24.852
- How far is the wall... from here?
- Like driving, hour and a half.

51:25.211 --> 51:28.000
On the other side. Right on the
other side of that wall is America?

51:28.201 --> 51:29.101
Yes.

51:29.124 --> 51:31.419
- Then we're very close?
- Very close.

51:31.502 --> 51:35.921
- We go, like what, early morning?
- No, we're waiting for another family.

51:35.945 --> 51:38.387
- Another family?
- Then we'll go to the wall together.

51:38.388 --> 51:43.588
Do you think the wall will keep
the creatures out of America?

51:43.653 --> 51:48.147
I think, American government
are spending a lot of money.

51:49.222 --> 51:52.090
- But you can't fight nature.
- No, exactly.

51:52.091 --> 51:53.691
your house.

51:54.931 --> 51:57.881
Yeah, it's like we're imprisoning
ourselves.

51:59.930 --> 52:02.501
Have you guys seen
one of the creatures?

52:04.109 --> 52:07.826
Have you ever seen it, like with
your own eyes? The creature, a live one.

52:08.227 --> 52:09.627
In Pecos Glen.

52:09.767 --> 52:10.884
Near here.

52:10.885 --> 52:14.285
I take photos.
Video... Hobby.

52:14.286 --> 52:15.852
- Shut up!
- Pecos Glen.

52:15.853 --> 52:17.453
- No...
- No money.

52:17.868 --> 52:18.927
How big is it?

52:18.928 --> 52:19.928
A 100 meters?

52:20.020 --> 52:21.054
- A hundred?
- Or more?

52:21.055 --> 52:21.955
Little bid more.

52:22.055 --> 52:23.655
More than a hundred meters?

52:23.856 --> 52:26.256
- Close to two...
- Wow.

52:26.257 --> 52:27.657
1 hundred 50 meters.

52:28.054 --> 52:30.430
Do you feel safe staying here?

52:31.337 --> 52:32.537
- I feel safe around here.
- You know...

52:32.538 --> 52:36.588
the high grounds, you're always safe.
The rivers you are not safe.

52:37.088 --> 52:39.707
If you don't bother them
they don't bother you.

52:40.007 --> 52:44.625
When American planes come
the creatures, very mad. You know?

52:44.626 --> 52:47.226
They get mad,
you know, crazy, crazy animals.

52:47.257 --> 52:51.741
- They, they, very, very dangerous.
- Do the planes, do they come around here?

52:52.842 --> 52:58.042
Did you see planes, yes?
That bring bombs and chemicals?

52:58.119 --> 53:00.119
Smell chemical poison.

53:02.211 --> 53:04.717
- Well, you can smell it?
- Smell it.

53:04.926 --> 53:07.663
What do they...
do they drop chemical weapons?

53:07.864 --> 53:08.764
Yes.

53:09.113 --> 53:11.980
Why do they bomb here?
The chemicals?

53:12.189 --> 53:18.164
Because the... there are many
extra-terrestrial in the trees.

53:24.692 --> 53:27.340
What do you mean there's
extra-terrestrials in the trees?

53:27.491 --> 53:29.400
All the trees are infected.

53:29.601 --> 53:32.301
What do you...
what do mean, the trees are infected?

53:33.575 --> 53:34.767
You wanna see?

53:39.719 --> 53:40.734
Here.

53:45.237 --> 53:46.779
What is that?

53:49.242 --> 53:52.119
- What is that?
- Look, it echoes back!

53:52.451 --> 53:54.305
That is wild.

53:57.914 --> 54:00.214
- There's something here.
- What is it?

54:00.415 --> 54:02.301
- It's okay.
- No, no, no, what is it?

54:05.878 --> 54:08.169
I don't think we should be touching it.

54:08.796 --> 54:11.589
- So, this is the infection?
- Why in the trees?

54:11.839 --> 54:15.635
They grow up and go to the river
on to the ocean.

54:16.429 --> 54:17.593
And then what?

54:18.885 --> 54:20.072
They're reproducing.

54:20.673 --> 54:23.596
They're reproducing in the ocean
and come back, and they come back.

54:23.597 --> 54:25.336
So they lay their eggs in the trees...

54:25.337 --> 54:28.037
where they grow
and they return to the rivers?

54:28.061 --> 54:29.501
Exactly, yes.

54:31.311 --> 54:33.796
I guess that's what they mean
by infected zone.

54:38.526 --> 54:40.007
Let's go back.

54:57.289 --> 54:58.891
How's your hand?

55:03.458 --> 55:05.351
Let's take off the bandage.

55:07.501 --> 55:09.298
Let it breathe a little bit.

55:11.633 --> 55:14.401
It's a lot better now
without all that weight.

55:15.718 --> 55:18.285
- What do you mean?
- The ring.

55:23.224 --> 55:26.369
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah, I wouldn't push it too far.

55:29.143 --> 55:32.428
- Thanks.
- Hey, no problem.

55:32.978 --> 55:37.283
- You need to move it a little around.
- No, I mean, thanks.

55:42.362 --> 55:44.554
Yeah.
You're welcome.

55:48.283 --> 55:50.135
I'm sorry about the other night.

55:51.701 --> 55:55.494
- It's okay.
- I was drunk.

55:59.081 --> 56:00.288
I'm sorry.

56:02.334 --> 56:05.336
I just don't want you to think of me
like that, when you think of me.

56:07.587 --> 56:08.612
It's okay.

56:23.890 --> 56:26.042
It's okay. You don't have to
do it perfect.

56:33.311 --> 56:38.366
Well... we'll be home in the morning.
It's gonna feel nice.

56:44.093 --> 56:45.356
It's too tight.

57:00.290 --> 57:01.566
It's still too tight.

57:15.173 --> 57:20.720
- We should probably get some sleep.
- Yeah... maybe, yeah.

58:31.684 --> 58:34.605
- They'e in trouble!
- Where is my camera?

58:37.232 --> 58:39.183
Where's my camera?

58:59.582 --> 59:01.599
Hey, what're we doing?
What's going on, why'd we stop.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.900
Shhh...
Shut up, sir.

59:05.984 --> 59:08.084
Clear and ready.

59:08.185 --> 59:13.007
- What's going on?
- Be quiet, be quiet.

59:15.215 --> 59:16.259
What's that?

59:19.638 --> 59:21.338
Get your gasmasks.

59:22.139 --> 59:26.534
Why you putting on gasmask?
Why you putting on the gasmask?

59:29.142 --> 59:31.920
Can we have a gasmask?
Can we have one gasmask?

59:39.321 --> 59:42.621
Son of bitch,
move, move, move!

59:43.422 --> 59:44.722
Go...

01:00:02.668 --> 01:00:05.169
Where you going?
Where you going!

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:15.507
Sit down, Sam.

01:00:18.719 --> 01:00:20.305
Sam, Sam, stay down.

01:02:16.343 --> 01:02:19.095
- Kaulder?
- Hang on!

01:02:41.274 --> 01:02:42.711
That's not good.

01:02:45.712 --> 01:02:46.812
Hello?

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.634
Kaulder?

01:04:11.961 --> 01:04:13.296
Kaulder?

01:07:12.523 --> 01:07:13.740
Wait!

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:20.720
Sam, it's gonna get dark soon.
We gotta keep going.

01:07:21.302 --> 01:07:22.597
Sam?

01:07:23.553 --> 01:07:25.721
Well, I have to pee.

01:07:32.327 --> 01:07:33.454
Do you mind?

01:07:58.886 --> 01:08:00.180
Look at this!

01:08:03.047 --> 01:08:04.718
What'd you find, "Cortez"?

01:08:29.098 --> 01:08:30.751
Oh, my God.

01:08:37.657 --> 01:08:40.523
That is the biggest man-made
structure I'v ever seen.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.794
It's like the seventh wonder.

01:08:45.694 --> 01:08:47.756
God, it's huge!

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.399
I thought I'd be
a lot happier to see it.

01:08:52.158 --> 01:08:54.658
Like I feel I could cry, but...

01:08:54.743 --> 01:08:59.087
I don't know if it would be a...
happy cry or sad cry.

01:09:00.913 --> 01:09:04.057
Well, it's different looking
at America from the outside.

01:09:04.758 --> 01:09:06.158
Really...

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:13.381
You know, just sitting right outside
and looking in.

01:09:15.107 --> 01:09:18.817
And when you get home
it's so easy to forget all of this.

01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:22.986
I mean, tomorrow we'll be
back to our seperate lives.

01:09:23.836 --> 01:09:28.892
In our like, perfect...
suburban homes.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:32.509
You know, everything that we've been
through it won't matter anymore.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.658
How old you think that girl was?

01:09:40.564 --> 01:09:43.701
Four... five years old?

01:09:51.573 --> 01:09:53.649
Let's talk about something else.

01:09:55.076 --> 01:09:56.728
Something funny.

01:09:57.411 --> 01:10:02.541
You know, people laugh different
depending on who they're around.

01:10:03.041 --> 01:10:08.251
Or, like, when you're little
you practice laughing. You know?

01:10:08.379 --> 01:10:11.713
- And you pretend...
- You practiced laughing?

01:10:11.922 --> 01:10:15.090
- You never did that?
- Practiced laughing?

01:10:15.091 --> 01:10:16.091
Yeah.

01:10:47.838 --> 01:10:51.990
Well, we got a long walk ahead of us in the
morning. You should probably get some sleep.

01:10:52.475 --> 01:10:54.583
I'm gonna stay awake
and keep a look out.

01:10:55.492 --> 01:10:59.296
And this will probably be the most
amazing place you've ever slept.

01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:04.908
- There's not a light for miles.
- I just hope the clouds break.

01:11:18.632 --> 01:11:22.844
I'm sure sometime.
I don't really see him that often.

01:11:23.136 --> 01:11:24.117
How come?

01:11:24.118 --> 01:11:27.118
He lives with his mother
and she's married now.

01:11:28.842 --> 01:11:32.501
- But you're still his father.
- Yeah, but he doesn't know that.

01:11:33.817 --> 01:11:36.777
- Doesn't that bother you?
- It's just easier that way.

01:11:36.861 --> 01:11:38.188
I don't wanna confuse him.

01:12:04.423 --> 01:12:08.160
There's no one in here...
and the power's off.

01:13:01.364 --> 01:13:02.689
Hello!

01:13:13.841 --> 01:13:17.132
- What happened here?
- I don't know.

01:13:18.667 --> 01:13:21.151
If you ask me
this looks like an airstrike.

01:13:31.432 --> 01:13:36.662
All these peoples homes.
But where are the people?

01:13:42.868 --> 01:13:44.862
You think anybody's under here?

01:13:47.402 --> 01:13:51.037
I feel like, if there was
anybody here, we'd smell them.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:59.311
Let's just keep going. There's gotta
be somebody somewhere.

01:14:40.349 --> 01:14:43.499
<i>- Are you sure it's dead?
- Yeah, it's dead.</i>

01:14:44.091 --> 01:14:45.276
<i>Stay here.</i>

01:15:04.064 --> 01:15:05.064
<i>Hello?</i>

01:15:06.465 --> 01:15:08.252
<i>Don't come in here, Sam.</i>

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:14.114
<i>- What're you doing?
- I'm just taking a picture.</i>

01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:29.808
Do you hear that?

01:16:15.089 --> 01:16:16.674
Excuse me?

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:48.361
Excuse me.

01:16:54.164 --> 01:16:55.935
Have you seen anybody else?

01:17:00.936 --> 01:17:03.736
What? What? What? What?
What? What? No!

01:17:06.048 --> 01:17:07.951
I got another thing to do.

01:17:11.076 --> 01:17:14.662
Another thing you gotta do.
Got cheese in the back of my truck.

01:17:17.348 --> 01:17:19.675
Three blind mice.
Three blind mice.

01:17:57.894 --> 01:18:00.185
- You see that light?
- Yeah.

01:18:03.922 --> 01:18:08.176
<i>- Hello, 911, what is your emergency?
- We're somewhere in the evacuation zone.</i>

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:14.670
<i>Uh... I'm not sure where. Somewhere off
of Farm Road 2777 and Highway 73.</i>

01:18:15.302 --> 01:18:18.097
<i>- Is anyone hurt?
- No, no ones hurt.</i>

01:18:18.106 --> 01:18:20.009
<i>Uh... we're both a little dehydrated.</i>

01:18:20.259 --> 01:18:23.328
<i>- But we're... we're fine.
- Boy, you're lucky to be alive.</i>

01:18:23.395 --> 01:18:25.645
<i>- Thank you.
- Okay, what are your names?</i>

01:18:25.803 --> 01:18:29.597
<i>Uh... one male, Andrew Kaulder.
Female, Sam Wynden.</i>

01:18:29.623 --> 01:18:32.224
<i>- Can you describe what you're wearing?
- Does it matter?</i>

01:18:32.389 --> 01:18:34.309
<i>Uh... we're the only two people here.</i>

01:18:34.394 --> 01:18:38.173
<i>We haven't seen anyone in the last 48 hours
from the Southern tip of the border.</i>

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.148
<i>Okay, don't move from that location.
We have an army patrol in the area,</i>

01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:43.749
<i>we're sending over right now.
They should be with you very soon.</i>

01:18:43.773 --> 01:18:45.250
<i>Just stay where you are, okay?</i>

01:18:49.012 --> 01:18:51.472
I always wanted to work
behind a register.

01:18:51.497 --> 01:18:52.797
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:53.683 --> 01:18:55.866
I thought it'd be cool
to work behind a register.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:59.344
- I used to have a register.
- I don't doubt that.

01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:02.913
- I had real money in it.
- I don't doubt that either.

01:19:03.547 --> 01:19:06.167
Just one dollar bills though.

01:19:06.824 --> 01:19:11.686
Isn't that funny how you immitate
you know, what's your parents do.

01:19:11.768 --> 01:19:15.914
Always see your dad counting money
so you'd sit there and count your money.

01:19:16.832 --> 01:19:21.186
Don't want my kid, uh...
immitating me.

01:19:23.811 --> 01:19:25.414
You should give him a camera.

01:19:29.855 --> 01:19:31.693
You look good behind a register.

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:38.570
So what're you gonna do tomorrow?

01:19:49.579 --> 01:19:51.056
I don't know.

01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:56.727
What're you gonna do?

01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:01.920
I don't know.

01:20:04.781 --> 01:20:08.786
Okay...
I'll make a phone call.

01:20:10.111 --> 01:20:12.296
I'll give you some privacy
to make your own.

01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:19.320
Is Tommy awake?
Yeah, will you, uh... you put him on?

01:20:20.302 --> 01:20:23.236
Hey buddy!
Happy birthday.

01:20:31.234 --> 01:20:32.432
Hi.

01:20:33.434 --> 01:20:34.578
Yeah, it's me.

01:20:34.987 --> 01:20:40.272
With big wheels?
Yeah, what color is it?

01:20:47.278 --> 01:20:51.316
Yeah...
I miss you too.

01:20:52.532 --> 01:20:54.275
Trust me, it's fine.

01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:00.630
I know.

01:21:06.521 --> 01:21:07.617
You did?

01:21:12.303 --> 01:21:13.406
Yeah.

01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:17.808
I'm sorry, I'm really tired.

01:21:30.856 --> 01:21:36.404
Okay, I... no I'll see you then.
No, I'll see you then.

01:21:37.354 --> 01:21:40.183
No, you don't need to come
down here. It's...

01:21:41.007 --> 01:21:45.635
No, because that would be pointless.
'Cause they're gonna be here soon, so...

01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:47.458
Hey...

01:21:49.059 --> 01:21:51.913
Yeah, I know, I'll be...
I'll be home in... in two days.

01:21:55.701 --> 01:21:59.834
Yeah. No, no, no, I'm... I'm...
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:22:00.885 --> 01:22:03.670
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
you guys were okay.

01:22:04.571 --> 01:22:05.671
Okay.

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:14.987
Listen, don't worry.
I'm gonna see you it's fine.

01:22:14.988 --> 01:22:16.691
We'll have plenty of time to talk.

01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:20.427
Well, that's good.
That's really good.

01:22:24.219 --> 01:22:25.827
I miss you too.

01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:32.829
Okay.

01:22:41.897 --> 01:22:43.440
I love you too.

01:29:19.948 --> 01:29:21.391
This is it.

01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:27.803
I don't wanna go home.

01:30:02.652 --> 01:30:04.387
<i>We've located one male
and female.</i>

01:30:04.388 --> 01:30:05.389
- We're heading in.
- Move! Move! Move!

01:30:05.595 --> 01:30:09.200
<i>You're in the restricted area.
We gotta get you out of here now.</i>
