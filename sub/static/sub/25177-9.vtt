<i>Previously on </i> Cloak and Dagger...

00:09.670 --> 00:11.169
You're lying and you know it!

00:11.170 --> 00:12.999
One of them shot Billy, I saw it.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.169
We've got no evidence of that.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.499
Enough already, Ma.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.119
You're afraid if I don't do everything

00:18.120 --> 00:20.079
just right, you're gonna lose me.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.999
Find rich kids, slip a little
somethin' into their drinks,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.249
<i>and jack them of their rich-kid stuff.</i>

00:25.250 --> 00:27.169
<i>I got pinched. Tandy, I put all my money</i>

00:27.170 --> 00:29.379
<i>into your new life. I need your help.</i>

00:29.380 --> 00:30.922
All this anger inside of me.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.996
What if I could find the
person who caused it?

00:33.021 --> 00:35.310
<i>It's not anger
in the bottle. It's poison.</i>

00:35.335 --> 00:37.169
Can I get a fifth
of the O'Harren's, please?

00:37.170 --> 00:39.829
- I like making girlfriend pancakes.
- I'm your girlfriend?

00:39.830 --> 00:41.249
This was the kid, right?

00:41.250 --> 00:44.459
<i>Hopped that yellow banister
and then disappeared.</i>

00:44.460 --> 00:45.829
<i>I killed you and buried you.</i>

00:45.830 --> 00:47.872
Detective Connors, you're under arrest

00:47.897 --> 00:49.687
for the murder of Billy Johnson.

00:51.309 --> 00:53.178
<i>- Peter Scarborough.
- I'll take the money.</i>

00:53.203 --> 00:55.782
Fuchs! I want celebration pancakes!

02:26.186 --> 02:31.185
Okay, let's talk
about what makes a hero.

02:31.210 --> 02:34.209
Now, as we've been discussing
for the last few weeks,

02:34.210 --> 02:37.959
the best heroes,
the ones we love and cherish,

02:37.960 --> 02:39.539
they follow an arc.

02:39.540 --> 02:43.669
Odysseus, Dorothy, Rick and Morty...

02:43.670 --> 02:46.329
...they've all walked the same path.

02:46.330 --> 02:49.079
They've answered the call,
met the mentor

02:49.080 --> 02:51.709
and battled the threshold guardians.

02:51.710 --> 02:54.079
They've come out of it
stronger than they've ever been.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.459
But towards the end of that arc,

02:56.460 --> 02:58.829
when the rubber meets the road...

02:58.830 --> 03:01.419
...the tire blows.

03:01.420 --> 03:03.879
Something knocks him down, hard.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.119
And that hero regresses.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.879
They lose everything.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.789
Become less than they were
when we met them.

03:09.790 --> 03:14.420
Because, well, if a hero
is going to be an actual hero...

03:15.670 --> 03:19.209
<i>he has to be born again, from nothing.</i>

04:37.330 --> 04:40.959
Get her out of here.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.669
There's a confession?

04:49.670 --> 04:51.379
Detective O'Reilly submitted a recording

04:51.380 --> 04:53.619
of Detective Connors
discussing the death

04:53.620 --> 04:55.879
of your son, William.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.879
We're looking into the
statements made on the tape.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.829
- Connors. That's his name?
- Yes, ma'am.

05:01.830 --> 05:05.039
We've opened a file to look into
Tyrone's version of events.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.579
What happens next?

05:07.580 --> 05:09.119
The detective is suspended,

05:09.120 --> 05:11.249
pending further investigation.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.379
And after that?

05:12.380 --> 05:13.669
It depends on our findings.

05:13.670 --> 05:15.879
We've heard that song before.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.209
There are eyes on these situations

05:17.210 --> 05:19.289
that weren't there before.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.709
So you can count on the fact
that a thorough examination

05:21.710 --> 05:23.579
of the evidence will be completed.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.919
I counted on that fact eight years ago.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.169
And here we are.

05:27.170 --> 05:29.209
I promise,

05:29.210 --> 05:31.499
I'll keep you apprised
of every development.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.710
Thank you.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.579
Wait. That... That's it,
that's all you're gonna say?

05:37.580 --> 05:39.330
Yes, Tyrone. We're leaving.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.880
Are you really just walking back
to the car like nothing happened?

05:48.210 --> 05:50.379
I was right!

05:50.380 --> 05:51.709
All these years I was right!

05:51.710 --> 05:53.829
Billy was exactly who I said he was.

05:53.830 --> 05:55.079
My brother was a hero.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.209
I don't need you to tell me
who Billy was.

05:57.210 --> 05:58.709
- Don't you dare.
- Mom...

05:58.710 --> 06:01.039
Just get in the car. I'm sure
you got some schoolwork...

06:01.040 --> 06:03.567
Schoolwork? Who the hell
cares about schoolwork?

06:03.592 --> 06:06.579
- Watch your mouth!
- Get in the car.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.330
We will talk about this later.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.669
You know what you would
tell me if I was out all night.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.142
Without your phone,
any way to reach you,

06:32.167 --> 06:35.080
like, come on, I gotta get to school,
and you got me worried about...

06:38.000 --> 06:39.749
What were you doing?

06:39.750 --> 06:42.704
There is nothing in all the
worlds that will destroy us

06:42.729 --> 06:44.319
like we will.

06:44.710 --> 06:48.279
Oh my G... How long have you been awake?

06:48.880 --> 06:51.379
How long we all gonna sleep?

06:51.380 --> 06:53.509
- Auntie...
- Don't Auntie me.

06:53.534 --> 06:56.627
- Oh...
- Another crisis is coming.

06:56.898 --> 06:59.358
Whether we want it to
or not, it is coming.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.709
And it is close.

07:03.252 --> 07:06.291
And goddamn it, if we aren't doin'
our best to bring it closer.

07:06.316 --> 07:07.539
You're not makin' any sense.

07:07.540 --> 07:10.999
What ROXXON is doin', Evita.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.790
Diggin' up all that makes
this place special.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.579
They've set the gears in motion.

07:19.580 --> 07:24.250
Happy to announce they are months
ahead of destroying the city.

07:27.986 --> 07:29.945
We can't stop it.

07:29.946 --> 07:31.355
Then who can?

07:31.356 --> 07:32.776
They can.

07:34.356 --> 07:35.815
The Divine Pairing.

07:35.816 --> 07:38.445
Every time.

07:38.446 --> 07:42.565
At this point,
the one has met the other.

07:42.566 --> 07:44.116
What if he hasn't?

07:47.486 --> 07:48.855
Ask him.

07:48.856 --> 07:50.815
Your boy, Tyrone.

07:50.816 --> 07:52.065
I need you to get some rest, okay?

07:52.066 --> 07:55.355
He trusts you. If there's
anybody he'd tell, it'd be you.

07:55.356 --> 07:57.615
- Ask him, please.
- Okay.

07:57.616 --> 07:59.985
Okay, I'll ask him, okay?

07:59.986 --> 08:02.736
Just... Just get some rest, please.

08:33.876 --> 08:37.889
I don't know what you gave me,
but I am flying.

08:39.236 --> 08:40.565
How about you?

08:40.566 --> 08:42.775
I'm getting there.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.142
What can I do

08:44.205 --> 08:46.125
to get you here with me?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.995
You're gonna think it's lame.

08:51.745 --> 08:54.705
I promise you, I will not.

08:57.875 --> 09:00.743
I want to know your greatest hopes.

09:01.412 --> 09:03.611
My greatest hopes?

09:03.831 --> 09:05.591
I recently learned...

09:06.875 --> 09:10.099
that I can see into people's hopes.

09:10.471 --> 09:14.141
- That sounds unreal.
- Mm, it very much is.

09:15.741 --> 09:17.941
But it's also amazing.

09:19.705 --> 09:22.041
And when I touch someone,

09:22.705 --> 09:25.002
the right someone,

09:25.875 --> 09:28.151
in the right place,

09:29.278 --> 09:31.858
I can step inside...

09:33.375 --> 09:36.165
and see where their hopes are pointed.

09:38.835 --> 09:43.454
Yours, it seems, run on one track.

09:48.035 --> 09:49.625
But the real trick...

09:53.085 --> 09:55.835
the one I've just recently
been working out...

09:59.165 --> 10:01.745
is that I can do more
than just see hopes.

10:06.875 --> 10:08.794
I can steal them,

10:08.895 --> 10:10.548
and feel them,

10:10.616 --> 10:13.946
and have them all for myself.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.625
A hero's regression
often begins with a trauma.

10:44.415 --> 10:48.164
One that is in some manner
a result of their actions,

10:48.165 --> 10:51.834
an unintended consequence
of their newfound abilities.

10:51.835 --> 10:55.371
The death of a loved one,
an uncovered truth,

10:55.495 --> 10:59.625
or a dream that, once realized,
reveals itself as a nightmare.

11:06.035 --> 11:10.584
<i>That trauma shocks our hero, and ushers
in those same fears and insecurities</i>

11:10.585 --> 11:13.374
<i>that held them back
before the journey began.</i>

11:13.375 --> 11:15.874
<i>But these fears and
insecurities that haunt them,</i>

11:15.875 --> 11:17.534
<i>they are now amplified.</i>

11:17.535 --> 11:20.034
<i>And our hero, now more powerful,</i>

11:20.035 --> 11:24.244
<i>can use that power
to turn their own life apart.</i>

11:24.245 --> 11:27.914
<i>When everything is taken away...
what's left?</i>

12:31.795 --> 12:32.795
Hello?

12:33.721 --> 12:36.100
- Anybody home?
- Tandy! Hey!

12:36.125 --> 12:40.744
Sorry, I was just, uh... Are you all right?
You look sick.

12:40.745 --> 12:43.334
Just a little too much
whiskey last night.

12:43.335 --> 12:45.664
And that, my dear,
is why I stick to edibles.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.034
- Wait, are those?
- Sadly, no.

12:50.035 --> 12:53.414
They're for my dad.
He keeps asking for them, so...

12:53.415 --> 12:55.454
You're taking cookies to your dad later?

12:55.455 --> 12:57.584
Oh, no. He's joining us for brunch.

12:57.585 --> 12:59.494
Is that cool?

12:59.495 --> 13:00.995
Yeah. Of course.

13:01.995 --> 13:03.835
Dad, Tandy's here.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.834
Hey, Tandy.

13:06.835 --> 13:12.034
Sorry about, uh...
I'm still tryin' to get used

13:12.035 --> 13:14.794
to my body not responding
the way I want it to.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.124
He can't move home until he can walk.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.414
But he's making good progress.

13:18.415 --> 13:20.624
And he's here,

13:20.625 --> 13:22.745
with us, that's all that matters.

13:23.995 --> 13:26.245
Happy to see you two together again.

13:34.585 --> 13:36.164
Why are you here?

13:36.165 --> 13:37.834
'Cause I clocked Benny.

13:37.835 --> 13:39.124
The question is, why isn't he here?

13:39.125 --> 13:41.204
I'm not talkin' about
the fight you got in.

13:41.205 --> 13:43.454
That's not the real reason.

13:43.579 --> 13:47.828
So I'll ask again: Why are you here?

13:47.906 --> 13:49.995
Am I supposed to know
what you're talking about?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.405
Okay.

13:53.616 --> 13:56.405
War of 1812, how did it end?

13:56.406 --> 13:58.946
Are you kidding me?
I'm in your history class.

14:01.946 --> 14:04.075
Put your arms out.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.366
Palms up.

14:09.946 --> 14:11.406
How did it end?

14:12.866 --> 14:15.115
Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814.

14:15.116 --> 14:18.405
Yes. That was the legal end of the war,

14:18.406 --> 14:19.785
but it wasn't the end of the fighting.

14:19.786 --> 14:22.735
The Battle of New Orleans rolled
into January, yes, I know.

14:22.736 --> 14:26.075
People continued to die in that war because
no one knew it was okay to stop fighting.

14:26.076 --> 14:29.535
And what? You think I'm
fightin' a war that's over?

14:29.536 --> 14:32.786
Aren't you? Since the night Billy
died, you've been fighting.

14:33.906 --> 14:38.075
To keep your anger in check,
to control your pain.

14:38.076 --> 14:41.736
The war is over,
but the battle still rages.

14:43.696 --> 14:45.866
Who's gonna die in that one?

14:53.696 --> 14:55.865
Caffeine expands
the capillaries in the brain,

14:55.866 --> 14:58.235
allowing increased blood flow.

14:58.236 --> 15:00.865
Which is my dad's way of
saying that it helps with a headache.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.495
Isn't that what I said?

15:02.496 --> 15:04.786
Tandy, you okay?

15:05.866 --> 15:07.365
Fine.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.655
- All right. You want some tea?
- Yes.

15:09.656 --> 15:10.735
- The usual?
- Yes.

15:10.736 --> 15:13.196
- I'll put the kettle on.
- Thank you.

15:16.196 --> 15:18.445
Have you decided what you wanna do?

15:18.446 --> 15:19.696
About ROXXON?

15:21.996 --> 15:23.405
No, I don't know.

15:23.406 --> 15:25.156
I can't believe it's been eight years.

15:26.616 --> 15:28.735
I mean, I know it's objectively true.

15:28.736 --> 15:31.695
It's just some cruel trick.

15:31.696 --> 15:35.445
My daughter's eight years older.
My best friend is dead.

15:35.446 --> 15:37.826
I know I've said all this
before, it's just...

15:40.196 --> 15:43.075
Your father was a good
man, Tandy, the best.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.736
- I miss him every day...
- Excuse me.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.036
- Hey, Tandy, are you...
- Fine.

16:03.446 --> 16:06.035
Hey... hey, I'm sorry
about my dad, he's just...

16:06.036 --> 16:08.735
he's still wrappin' his head
around everything.

16:08.736 --> 16:09.696
It's fine.

16:11.366 --> 16:13.405
I have a confession.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.196
I had an ulterior motive
for inviting you to brunch.

16:17.446 --> 16:19.286
I wanna offer you a job at ROXXON.

16:21.076 --> 16:22.235
I'm sorry?

16:22.236 --> 16:24.495
Look, our department's expanding.

16:24.496 --> 16:26.995
I know you're smart, capable.

16:26.996 --> 16:29.064
And to be honest,
any daughter of Nathan Bowen

16:29.088 --> 16:30.655
is as good as hired in my book.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.421
You'd be working with me

16:32.446 --> 16:34.259
as we continue the work
our fathers started.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.075
What do you say? Are you in?

17:33.328 --> 17:35.668
Now you know how it feels.

17:54.996 --> 17:57.286
It's important to know
that regression is a trick,

17:58.736 --> 18:00.826
just like most aspects of story.

18:01.906 --> 18:04.655
Our heroes can never actually regress.

18:04.656 --> 18:06.995
They can't be who they used to be.

18:06.996 --> 18:08.786
<i>That person is gone.</i>

18:10.656 --> 18:13.656
<i>That person is dead forever,
and they're never coming back.</i>

18:15.736 --> 18:18.576
<i>And our heroes, they just
can't hit the reset button.</i>

18:19.946 --> 18:23.195
<i>They cannot undo the most
traumatic events of their life.</i>

18:46.496 --> 18:50.575
<i>But many heroes find
themselves trying to do exactly that.</i>

18:50.576 --> 18:54.826
<i>And they dive back into the very life
they tried so desperately to escape.</i>

18:56.196 --> 18:59.325
<i>Whatever it takes to stop the pain.</i>

18:59.326 --> 19:02.286
<i>Whatever they can do
to quell the regret.</i>

19:12.036 --> 19:16.036
<i>This is a desperate play to make
everything how it used to be.</i>

19:17.656 --> 19:19.231
Hey.

19:25.536 --> 19:27.155
It's so good to see you, Liam.

19:27.156 --> 19:28.365
You all right?

19:28.366 --> 19:31.535
Yeah. Yeah, no, I just... I missed you.

19:31.536 --> 19:35.785
Really? 'Cause after I got
popped, I never heard a word.

19:35.786 --> 19:38.655
I figured you must've
skipped town on me.

19:38.656 --> 19:42.235
Then I heard that you hadn't
left, so I figured you had...

19:42.236 --> 19:45.785
- What?
- Moved on.

19:45.786 --> 19:49.075
No. No... Liam.

19:49.076 --> 19:52.155
If it was possible,
I'd have moved backwards.

19:52.241 --> 19:57.870
I just... it took me a while... you
know, to get the cash to bail you out.

19:57.895 --> 20:02.015
But I got the cash... I got you out.
I'm here.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.577
Come on. I have something
I want you to see.

20:17.997 --> 20:19.247
You ready to talk yet?

20:20.907 --> 20:23.286
I guess that's a no.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.820
You do realize how close
you are to expulsion, don't you?

20:27.367 --> 20:28.577
Is that what you want?

20:41.157 --> 20:43.707
So this is it, this is where you live?

20:47.447 --> 20:48.616
It is.

20:48.617 --> 20:52.287
- It's bigger than I thought.
- It's colder, too.

20:54.407 --> 20:56.318
Especially alone.

21:00.287 --> 21:02.247
Things can get better, Tyrone.

21:03.577 --> 21:04.827
Can they?

21:06.537 --> 21:07.616
They would if you let them.

21:07.617 --> 21:09.366
Really? Because I'm pretty sure

21:09.367 --> 21:11.111
that even though I've got what I wanted,

21:11.136 --> 21:12.496
nothing is better.

21:12.497 --> 21:14.259
That's because you've defined yourself

21:14.284 --> 21:15.827
by the worst thing that's
ever happened to you.

21:17.247 --> 21:19.247
That doesn't have to be true, Tyrone.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.706
But first, you have to
choose to end the war.

21:22.707 --> 21:26.496
And what? Lock myself away, like you?

21:26.497 --> 21:28.656
With a bible
and a bunch of pretty speeches

21:28.657 --> 21:30.447
that don't mean anything?

21:33.247 --> 21:34.446
Is that what you think my life is?

21:34.447 --> 21:35.997
I think you have no one.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.616
I think you live in a sacred box alone,

21:39.617 --> 21:42.616
protected.

21:42.617 --> 21:46.446
Pretending that you feel
this presence of God.

21:46.447 --> 21:50.116
But in fact...
you really put yourself here

21:50.117 --> 21:51.707
so you don't have to feel anything.

21:52.997 --> 21:55.117
Do you know why I live here, Liam?

21:56.537 --> 21:59.036
I thought because it was free.

21:59.037 --> 22:01.746
But the way that you're
askin' that question...

22:01.747 --> 22:04.446
I always wanted to get married here.

22:04.447 --> 22:07.746
Married? You?

22:07.747 --> 22:08.997
Yeah.

22:15.367 --> 22:16.906
What's going on with you?

22:16.931 --> 22:18.249
What do you mean?

22:18.273 --> 22:20.552
Saying nice things,
you're talking about marriage?

22:20.577 --> 22:23.826
- Yeah, so?
- So since when is that you?

22:23.827 --> 22:26.577
It's so, uh, hopeful.

22:28.707 --> 22:31.617
You know the dreams I dread the
most before I go to sleep?

22:33.077 --> 22:34.787
The good ones.

22:35.947 --> 22:37.827
The happy ones.

22:38.827 --> 22:41.192
The hopeful ones.

22:41.867 --> 22:45.582
Because then you wake up, and
you're back to your own life, and...

22:47.683 --> 22:50.285
I realized something
when I was without you.

22:51.947 --> 22:53.976
It's my own fault.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.162
I'm the reason I dread those dreams

22:56.187 --> 22:59.101
because I'm not doing anything
to make my life any better.

23:00.817 --> 23:02.607
That's gonna stop.

23:03.497 --> 23:05.497
I wanna build a life.

23:07.287 --> 23:09.157
A happy one.

23:10.247 --> 23:11.447
Finally.

23:13.747 --> 23:15.657
The church isn't somewhere
I came to hide.

23:16.827 --> 23:18.446
It's where I found answers.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.189
- Tyrone...
- Do you think you or whatever you think

23:22.214 --> 23:24.616
this God is has answers for me?

23:24.898 --> 23:27.727
You have no idea what I've been through.

23:27.751 --> 23:28.881
You don't know me.

23:30.708 --> 23:33.998
And neither does your God
because he doesn't exist.

23:34.617 --> 23:36.577
You were a good dream, Liam.

23:39.037 --> 23:42.039
I just had to wake up to realize it.

23:42.157 --> 23:43.787
- Tyrone...
- Move.

23:43.812 --> 23:45.545
If you walk out that door
without permission

23:45.570 --> 23:47.780
- and there's nothing that I can do to...
- I said move!

23:47.805 --> 23:49.117
No, not until you...

25:59.850 --> 26:01.230
Tandy?

26:04.868 --> 26:06.828
What the hell are you doing?

26:24.163 --> 26:25.253
Are you okay?

26:26.748 --> 26:27.748
Just go.

26:29.359 --> 26:31.149
- I'm sorry.
- Now.

26:45.413 --> 26:48.622
Now as the audience, naturally we
wanna see our heroes at their best.

26:48.688 --> 26:51.017
We root for them to save us all.

26:51.062 --> 26:53.607
<i>To pull themselves
out of their downward spiral.</i>

26:53.608 --> 26:56.518
<i>But sometimes the allure of the
downward spiral is too strong.</i>

26:57.568 --> 26:59.857
<i>Sometimes our heroes are too weak.</i>

26:59.858 --> 27:02.663
<i>When that goes down, one
of two things can happen:</i>

27:02.688 --> 27:05.426
We either witness the death of our hero,

27:06.148 --> 27:10.918
or we realize we've been front row
to the origin of something else.

27:11.148 --> 27:13.307
<i>The birth of a villain.</i>

27:13.415 --> 27:15.857
I tried to convince him
to take the sergeant's exam.

27:15.858 --> 27:17.807
He had the record for it, right?

27:17.808 --> 27:20.147
But Fuchs wouldn't give up that beat.

27:20.148 --> 27:23.033
I rode with him a few days when
we were on tactical alert.

27:23.096 --> 27:25.713
Everyone in that damn
neighborhood knew who he was.

27:25.775 --> 27:28.067
Fuchs had won 'em over somehow.

27:28.068 --> 27:30.688
- He was a good man.
- Yeah.

27:35.728 --> 27:37.608
Anyone have a drink for me?

27:40.358 --> 27:41.358
Thank you.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.357
To Fuchs.

27:49.358 --> 27:50.560
Fuchs.

27:50.585 --> 27:53.271
A great guy, a solid cop.

27:54.308 --> 27:57.608
It's a damn tragedy that he got
involved with the wrong people.

28:17.398 --> 28:21.647
How's your little quest for
justice feelin' now, New York?

28:21.648 --> 28:24.348
You really think your
inadmissible YouTube videos

28:24.373 --> 28:26.493
would keep me behind bars?

28:37.148 --> 28:41.268
Don't stay down too long.
You and me ain't finished yet.

28:42.268 --> 28:45.517
Whiskey, nice and cold.

29:03.765 --> 29:05.095
We need to talk.

29:06.717 --> 29:08.426
- Now?
- It's important.

29:08.451 --> 29:10.687
Look, I know you're goin' through a lot.

29:10.688 --> 29:12.017
Do you?

29:12.018 --> 29:14.187
Whatever it is I can help, okay?

29:14.554 --> 29:18.014
- No, you can't.
- Yes. Really. I can.

29:18.478 --> 29:20.938
But you gotta talk to me.

29:25.608 --> 29:28.727
I was at the police station
this morning.

29:28.728 --> 29:30.107
You were?

29:30.108 --> 29:31.517
Why?

29:31.518 --> 29:34.148
- Because the cop that...
- Tyrone?

29:36.518 --> 29:39.477
- Tandy, what are you...?
- Stay out of my head.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.076
You really think I wanna be in there?

29:41.101 --> 29:43.140
- Obviously you do.
- Hey...

29:43.141 --> 29:45.350
strangely aggressive tiny girl.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.997
Ty's havin' a pretty awful day,

29:47.022 --> 29:48.677
so maybe you can yell at him
another time.

29:48.702 --> 29:49.720
Can you just stay outta this?

29:49.721 --> 29:51.311
Oh, no, I don't think so.

29:52.471 --> 29:54.100
You ought to get the hell out of here...

30:04.261 --> 30:05.971
No!

30:08.181 --> 30:09.600
Oh, my God.

30:09.601 --> 30:10.971
How did you...?

30:11.971 --> 30:13.011
It's you.

30:17.471 --> 30:19.141
Wait, Evita.

30:21.181 --> 30:23.010
What the hell was that?
What are you doing?

30:23.011 --> 30:24.210
I didn't hurt her.

30:24.235 --> 30:26.811
Were you doing to her what you were
doing to that guy in the church?

30:28.051 --> 30:30.489
Tandy, you weren't
just looking at hopes.

30:30.514 --> 30:31.600
What do you care?

30:31.601 --> 30:33.431
I care because you did it to Evita.

30:34.511 --> 30:36.536
What was it? Tell me.

30:36.561 --> 30:38.970
No, I don't have to tell you anything.

30:38.995 --> 30:41.285
What do you think, you and I
are some sort of partnership?

30:42.261 --> 30:43.680
Well, we're not.

30:43.681 --> 30:45.071
Okay? I owe you nothing.

30:45.096 --> 30:48.711
- You came here.
- To tell you to stay out of my head, Ty.

30:48.736 --> 30:51.010
Why the hell would I
wanna be in your head?

30:51.011 --> 30:52.969
I don't need your drama in my life.

30:52.994 --> 30:55.063
- I got enough shit in my own.
- Spare me.

30:55.088 --> 30:57.010
I'd pay money to have your problems.

30:57.011 --> 30:59.141
Your cop confessed. You win.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.336
You wanna know what I won?

31:02.641 --> 31:04.516
Nothing.

31:04.761 --> 31:06.319
Okay? Nothing's changed.

31:06.344 --> 31:07.546
Maybe it's worse.

31:07.571 --> 31:10.186
My dad is shut down, my mom
won't even look at me. I...

31:10.211 --> 31:12.610
What, did you think you were
just gonna fix your family?

31:12.726 --> 31:14.225
Jesus, Ty.

31:14.532 --> 31:16.528
You know, let me give you a
little tip from the real world,

31:16.563 --> 31:17.786
Prep School.

31:17.922 --> 31:19.680
Nothing changes.

31:19.971 --> 31:22.761
It just is, again and again.

31:22.786 --> 31:24.938
Look, I know you think
things are rough...

31:24.963 --> 31:26.073
Rough?

31:26.481 --> 31:29.224
You saw what my dad
did to my mom, right?

31:31.200 --> 31:33.445
That's me, too.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.874
And that's what I was doing
to Liam in the church,

31:35.899 --> 31:37.978
taking out all my own shit on him.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.939
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm a screwed up bitch, Tyrone.

31:44.479 --> 31:46.670
Have you even talked
to your mom about this?

31:46.695 --> 31:47.938
No.

31:47.939 --> 31:50.308
But you know what?
We're both on the same page.

31:50.309 --> 31:51.978
If you don't hurt, you get hurt.

31:51.979 --> 31:54.977
- That's not how I see it.
- You will if you ever grow up.

31:55.059 --> 31:58.084
And learn there is nothing you can
do to bring your big bro back.

31:58.109 --> 32:01.898
Excuse me if I don't take wellness
advice from the Bowen family.

32:01.899 --> 32:03.729
Screw you, Tyrone.

32:06.849 --> 32:09.237
I'll see you in your dreams.

32:21.219 --> 32:25.422
By now, you may be wondering,
what is the point of regression?

32:27.515 --> 32:29.624
Why watch our hero
go through any of this?

32:30.156 --> 32:32.500
<i>Because the story isn't about them.</i>

32:33.501 --> 32:35.030
<i>It's about us.</i>

32:42.689 --> 32:45.844
<i>Heroes make mistakes because we do.</i>

32:46.439 --> 32:49.423
<i>They do things they regret
because we do.</i>

32:51.857 --> 32:56.161
<i>And like most any story told,
myth is a mirror.</i>

32:58.340 --> 33:02.449
<i>One we hold up to see
ourselves more clearly.</i>

33:03.229 --> 33:06.439
<i>But that is the catch-22
of the human condition.</i>

33:08.441 --> 33:11.821
<i>The inability to see ourselves
for who we are.</i>

33:13.051 --> 33:16.181
<i>We can often only do it
through someone else's eyes.</i>

33:18.769 --> 33:22.648
<i>And when we do, we may
not like what they see.</i>

33:31.269 --> 33:34.521
<i>So as we watch the rise
and fall of our heroes,</i>

33:34.857 --> 33:39.309
<i>the question we ask should not
be, will they be greater?</i>

33:41.399 --> 33:43.475
<i>Can they ascend?</i>

33:43.748 --> 33:45.808
<i>No.</i>

33:45.833 --> 33:48.938
<i>When that rubber hits the road,
and that tire blows,</i>

33:49.943 --> 33:52.201
<i>the question we should ask is,</i>

33:52.434 --> 33:54.189
<i>will we be greater?</i>

33:54.269 --> 33:56.768
<i>Can we ascend?</i>

34:03.939 --> 34:04.939
Liam?

34:05.979 --> 34:07.266
Liam, are you here?

34:08.059 --> 34:10.635
I think I owe you an apology.

34:12.349 --> 34:14.268
Liam?

34:45.219 --> 34:47.389
Yes, Mr. Scarborough?

34:47.500 --> 34:49.812
I'm here now, I'll fix it.

34:50.478 --> 34:53.422
I don't know.
The heat just started spiking.

34:53.539 --> 34:55.284
Okay, I said I'll fix it.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.025
Great. Dan.

35:03.019 --> 35:05.478
Hey, you guys. It's probably
safest if you step...

35:09.899 --> 35:11.349
Hey, you guys okay?

35:15.809 --> 35:17.228
- What the...?
- Come on!

35:35.309 --> 35:37.608
<i>Attention all units, including tactical.</i>

35:37.609 --> 35:40.181
<i>Suspect in the homicide of Officer
Fuchs has been identified.</i>

35:40.213 --> 35:42.681
<i>Respond to 1344 Solomon Place.</i>

35:42.752 --> 35:44.519
<i>This is a level four city-wide call.</i>

35:56.729 --> 35:57.849
Tyrone.

35:59.906 --> 36:01.398
Sit down.

36:01.609 --> 36:02.968
Please.

36:17.189 --> 36:19.399
Go ahead and ask whatever you wanna ask.

36:26.519 --> 36:28.059
Why didn't you do anything?

36:31.609 --> 36:34.496
For all those years,
you never listened to me.

36:34.965 --> 36:36.674
Never even tried.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.179
Is that what you think happened?

36:38.228 --> 36:39.768
It is what happened.

36:41.238 --> 36:42.803
If you were telling the truth,

36:42.975 --> 36:47.084
then that meant...
a cop murdered a teenage boy

36:47.389 --> 36:49.194
and covered up the crime.

36:49.256 --> 36:53.018
And the only way to do that,
means that he had help doing it.

36:53.222 --> 36:54.721
A lot of help.

36:55.214 --> 36:59.384
And that cop gets nervous and he
decides he needs to tie up loose ends.

37:01.213 --> 37:03.172
What happens to that little boy

37:03.339 --> 37:05.938
who's the only living witness
to what he did?

37:06.136 --> 37:07.518
I wasn't afraid of them.

37:07.581 --> 37:10.136
Well, that's a luxury that you had.

37:10.214 --> 37:13.040
But your father and I
couldn't afford that luxury.

37:13.071 --> 37:14.931
We had to be afraid.

37:15.939 --> 37:19.993
Because you alive or you dead,
it meant nothing to them.

37:20.298 --> 37:22.608
It still doesn't.

37:23.034 --> 37:25.839
- And what you did...
- I had backup. We got him on tape.

37:25.878 --> 37:29.870
You had a white cop on tape
confessing to killing a black kid.

37:29.933 --> 37:32.144
Have you been paying attention, Tyrone?

37:32.174 --> 37:35.765
Because in the world that we live in,
that means absolutely nothing.

37:35.790 --> 37:37.829
So I should just, what?

37:37.830 --> 37:40.063
Throw my hands up and give up,
is that what you're saying?

37:40.126 --> 37:42.295
You put yourself
in their crosshairs again.

37:42.319 --> 37:45.318
Someone has to.
Otherwise nothing will change.

37:45.319 --> 37:47.358
I've already lost one son, Tyrone.

37:47.359 --> 37:49.859
And if I don't stand up,
it will be for nothing.

37:51.606 --> 37:54.645
Watch your mouth. Pull your pants up.
Take your hoodie down.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.068
When does it end?

37:56.511 --> 37:59.938
We got all sorts of rules,
but you said it best.

38:00.219 --> 38:02.979
Even if I do everything perfect,
they still could come after me.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.538
So why be perfect?

38:11.529 --> 38:14.938
Why not stand up for the world
the way it should be?

38:15.144 --> 38:17.068
What about my kids, Ma?

38:17.245 --> 38:18.859
Your grandkids.

38:22.241 --> 38:24.317
Everyone who loves you...

38:24.833 --> 38:27.911
what would happen to them
if something happened to you?

38:30.316 --> 38:32.476
I watched him die.

38:35.946 --> 38:38.035
I couldn't walk away.

38:38.202 --> 38:40.568
No matter what it cost, I couldn't.

38:40.655 --> 38:42.155
You are here.

38:43.489 --> 38:48.002
Okay? Billy is dead, so...

38:48.319 --> 38:50.721
you have to let it go.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.346
Stop... all of it.

38:53.823 --> 38:56.358
The guilt. The regret.

38:56.663 --> 38:58.243
The fear.

39:02.662 --> 39:04.701
I'm not sure who I am without it.

39:04.991 --> 39:07.281
I know who you are.

39:09.529 --> 39:11.439
I see it every day.

39:13.055 --> 39:14.894
I see your bravery,

39:14.955 --> 39:18.278
and your intelligence,
and your will power.

39:21.798 --> 39:24.903
You're more like your brother
than you'll ever know.

39:27.522 --> 39:32.311
It inspires me, almost as much
as it scares the shit out of me.

39:42.468 --> 39:44.297
Tyrone Johnson!

39:44.348 --> 39:45.858
You are under arrest for the
murder of Officer Fuchs!

39:45.859 --> 39:47.148
- Tyrone, go!
- Mom, what's happening?

39:47.149 --> 39:49.488
- Go! Run! Go! Go!
- Come out with your hands up!

40:04.906 --> 40:07.656
Mom, I know you're here. The
door was unlocked, and I...

40:12.464 --> 40:14.334
wanna talk about everything.

40:15.950 --> 40:18.323
About Dad...

40:19.464 --> 40:21.440
about me...

40:23.739 --> 40:25.399
I don't know, I just...

40:27.592 --> 40:28.842
I need to...

40:37.828 --> 40:39.958
Come out, Tandy.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.398
Who are you?

40:43.399 --> 40:45.786
Mr. Scarborough sends his regards.

40:45.818 --> 40:49.199
I'm gonna kill Mommy in three seconds
unless you come out.

40:49.224 --> 40:51.067
You know I'm not one to bluff.

40:51.068 --> 40:52.607
Three.

40:52.608 --> 40:54.281
<i>When the rubber hits the road,</i>

40:54.306 --> 40:55.837
<i>and that tire blows...</i>

40:55.900 --> 40:57.067
Two.

40:57.127 --> 41:01.080
<i>...we will ask ourselves the question
at the center of all myth...</i>

41:01.127 --> 41:03.067
One.

41:03.068 --> 41:04.806
<i>Who are we?</i>

41:04.830 --> 41:06.376
