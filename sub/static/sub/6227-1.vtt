WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.051
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.127 --> 00:03.174
It's a boy.

00:03.253 --> 00:04.505
Whether you accept
this child or not,

00:04.588 --> 00:06.340
I'm going to have
our baby, Nick.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.767
I still killed
three women.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.094
They won't
stop looking.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.722
What we need is a suspect
that's about your height.

00:12.804 --> 00:13.896
With a British accent.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.770
What are the chances
of finding that?

00:16.934 --> 00:18.402
No!

00:18.477 --> 00:20.104
I didn't know
Kenneth was going to do that.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.281
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.656
Goodbye, Juliette.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.490
Oh, Juliette!

00:33.992 --> 00:35.164
Get her!

00:48.090 --> 00:49.137
No!

00:49.508 --> 00:50.634
No...

01:00.602 --> 01:01.649
No!

01:02.062 --> 01:04.156
No, get...
What are you doing?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.357
Wait...
Don't hurt him!

01:05.440 --> 01:06.817
Trubel! Run!

01:17.744 --> 01:18.870
Oh, my God.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.274
What are you doing?

03:09.773 --> 03:10.899
Trubel?

03:24.579 --> 03:26.377
Hank.
Nick, just checking on you.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.504
I'm heading in.
There were a lot of them.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.642
They must have drugged me
with something.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.136
Where are you?

03:32.838 --> 03:33.964
At home.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.258
Juliette's dead.
What?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.844
Juliette's dead.
They took Trubel.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.645
All right, Nick, stay there.
I'm on my way.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.442
Oh, Juliette!

03:56.153 --> 03:57.279
Nick.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.454
Hey. I was trying
to let you sleep.

04:05.829 --> 04:09.459
I know. Thanks, but my
brain wouldn't shut off.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.834
Wouldn't even
slow down.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.883
I know. There's a little
too much going on.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.598
What am I saying? There's
a lot too much going on.

04:17.798 --> 04:21.724
I was thinking, you know, Nick's
going to need a lot of help.

04:22.804 --> 04:26.854
Adalind's gonna have that baby
sooner than later, and...

04:26.933 --> 04:28.059
And what?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.278
It's Nick.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.442
Hey, Nick. How are you...
Have you seen Trubel?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.694
No. Are you okay?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.138
When was the last
time you saw her?

04:39.196 --> 04:41.540
Last night, we left her at Bud's.
What's wrong?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.367
Juliette's dead.
What?

04:43.450 --> 04:46.420
They took her body, they
grabbed Trubel, they took my mom's head.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.503
I don't know what the hell's going on.
I'll call you back.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.552
Juliette's dead?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.462
What the hell?

05:15.524 --> 05:18.994
She was hiding,
she went to the trailer...

05:19.569 --> 05:22.664
You know that FBI Agent,
I think her name's Chavez?

05:23.406 --> 05:24.407
She's Wesen.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.788
You saw her Woge?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.119
Yeah, when she kidnapped me.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.671
- It's Chavez.
- Nick!

05:29.746 --> 05:31.168
- It's Chavez.
- Nick!

05:31.540 --> 05:32.883
Nick, what happened?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.336
Juliette was here last
night, trying to kill me.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.591
She would have, too,
but Trubel shot her.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.846
Trubel killed Juliette?

05:38.922 --> 05:41.345
Yeah, with the crossbow,
before she could kill me.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.641
Oh, my God.
Juliette's dead?

05:42.717 --> 05:43.957
I was holding her
when she died.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.972
I thought you said she got
on the helicopter. No!

05:46.012 --> 05:48.356
I saw her heading to the helicopter,
I never saw her get on it.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.274
Hank, she's dead. I was
holding her in my arms and...

05:50.350 --> 05:52.148
Okay, okay. Nick, Nick,
Nick, just take it easy.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.854
Then we got hit. They
came in from everywhere.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.777
Who? I don't know, but
it was professional.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.362
They grabbed Trubel. I tried
to stop them, they drugged me.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.365
When I woke up, Juliette's body
was gone, and my mom's head...

06:01.444 --> 06:02.821
They took everything,
even the crossbow.

06:02.904 --> 06:03.904
Why?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.871
So there'd be no evidence of what they
did, or that Trubel was ever here.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.577
Why? Was it the Royals?
No. It wasn't the Royals.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.791
If it was the Royals, I'd be
dead right now! Okay, then who?

06:10.871 --> 06:11.872
Chavez.

06:11.955 --> 06:12.995
The FBI agent?
That Chavez?

06:12.998 --> 06:14.124
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.629
Well, none of this is making
much sense right now.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.673
She abducted Trubel once before.
What the hell...

06:17.752 --> 06:19.095
To see if she
was a Grimm.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.387
But what does she
want with a Grimm?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.057
Trubel told me that Chavez was
part of a secret government group

06:23.133 --> 06:25.386
that wanted to use her
to help them go after Wesen.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.220
But if they wanted a Grimm,
why didn't they take you, too?

06:27.304 --> 06:28.851
Chavez doesn't
know about me.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.058
When she was investigating Weston
Steward shooting the Captain,

06:31.141 --> 06:32.188
I wasn't a Grimm.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.315
And they saw one of the books from
the trailer in Trubel's room!

06:34.394 --> 06:36.237
All right. How did they even
know Trubel was here now?

06:36.313 --> 06:38.236
They must have been tracking her
or waiting for her to show up.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.395
I don't know,
but they knew.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.401
All right, Nick, I need
you to slow down.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.245
I need you to find out
everything you can about Chavez.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.664
All right.
What are you gonna do?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.495
I'm going after her.
No. Wait.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.121
Wait. Wait!

06:50.076 --> 06:52.499
You do realize you're talking
about going after an FBI agent?

06:52.704 --> 06:54.798
She's Wesen.
I'm taking her down.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.532
- Captain!
- We got good news.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.079
We think we got
our Jack the Ripper.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.622
When? Call came in last night,

07:27.697 --> 07:30.291
found a body in a warehouse
in Northwest Industrial.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.368
You got an l.D.?

07:31.660 --> 07:33.788
Kenneth Alun
Goderich Bowes-Lyon,

07:33.870 --> 07:35.630
presently holding a
passport from Luxembourg,

07:35.664 --> 07:37.086
so the accent
probably fits.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.384
And we found the
murder weapon on him.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.052
Lab's got it now.
What happened to him?

07:41.878 --> 07:45.223
Remember that last girl that got attacked
and was rescued by the three guys?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.891
Now we're
thinking they went vigilante.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.685
Interesting problem
we got in this one,

07:48.760 --> 07:53.061
a lawyer from Austria is already making
inquiries about having the body returned.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.975
Apparently he's some
kind of royalty.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.230
If you care about
that kind of thing.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.310
Not really.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.904
Do what you need to wrap it up.
Okay.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.857
Hey, good work.

08:09.239 --> 08:13.415
Why don't you tell me about the young
lady living in your house, Theresa Rubel?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.541
She's awfully handy
with a machete.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.479
Hank, I need to talk to you about
a 911 call that just came in.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.354
All right, not now.
But you need to hear this.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.232
Description matched, we found
the murder weapon on his body.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.104
I'm preparing a statement
for release this afternoon.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.028
Yes, of course, we'll continue our search
for the vigilantes who killed him.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.109
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.076
What's wrong? Nick has
gone off the deep end.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.698
H ow?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.301
He's going after Chavez,
the FBI Agent.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.913
What?
Why?

08:55.243 --> 08:56.665
He thinks she took Trubel.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.713
From Bud's house?

08:59.789 --> 09:00.881
No, from Nick's.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.842
Trubel came back
to his house last night.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.632
Juliette was there.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.759
How could she be there?
She got on that helicopter.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.717
That's what I thought, too. But she
didn't, she came back to kill Nick.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.976
At least that's
what Nick told me.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.637
Where's Juliette now?
She's dead.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.149
Nick killed Juliette?

09:18.224 --> 09:20.022
No, Trubel did.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.853
All right, let me see if
I've got this straight.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.189
Juliette does not get on that
helicopter with the Royals.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.445
Instead she goes over to Nick's
house and tries to kill him.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.323
But then Trubel shows up
and kills Juliette instead.

09:29.402 --> 09:33.032
And then Agent Chavez of the FBI
arrives and takes Trubel away.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.234
Along with Juliette's dead
body and his mother's head.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.669
Why would Chavez do that?
To cover it up.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.421
What was Nick doing
during all this time?

09:40.497 --> 09:44.001
Sorry, I left out the part where they
burst into his house and drugged him.

09:48.505 --> 09:52.135
Nick is convinced that Chavez is behind it
all, and he's going to "take her down".

09:54.677 --> 09:56.930
His words, not mine.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.026
Hanford has
extensive outdoor experience.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.946
Now, there was a possible sighting
two days ago in The Dalles.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.235
Credible?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.237
Off-duty police officer
was buying beer,

10:08.316 --> 10:09.568
thought he recognized
the face,

10:09.651 --> 10:11.824
but didn't put it together
until later that night.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.579
Follow up.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.711
We have got a Detective
Burkhardt, Portland Police,

10:19.786 --> 10:21.208
says he needs to see you.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.043
Send him up.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.875
If Nick was drugged, do you
believe what he's saying?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.678
I don't know what happened
there last night.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.552
Well, this may not be the
best time to bring it up,

10:28.628 --> 10:30.881
but a 911 call
just came in.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.554
Two bodies were found across
the street from Nick's house.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.850
Looks like a home invasion.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.854
Across the street from his house?
Yes, sir, directly.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.439
Officers are en route.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.224
You think this is connected
to what happened?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.308
It has to be.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.565
Nick wants us to run
a background on Chavez.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.982
Little dicey doing a
background on an FBI agent.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.737
I don't want any connection
to this precinct.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.284
If you do it,
don't do it here.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.529
But I suggest you
find Nick first.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.078
What can I do
for you, Detective?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.326
Do we have an
investigation in common?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.457
No.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.037
So what do you need?

11:03.955 --> 11:07.505
I need you to tell me
where Theresa Rubel is.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.926
Theresa Rubel.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.300
Isn't that the young woman who
was staying in your house?

11:11.379 --> 11:14.508
You know exactly who she is. You
took her from my house last night!

11:14.591 --> 11:16.551
I don't know what you're
talking about, Detective.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.929
Are you saying
she was kidnapped?

11:19.053 --> 11:20.100
Where is she?

11:21.264 --> 11:23.062
I'm not sure I understand
where you're going with this.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.441
You took Trubel, you took Juliette's
body, you took my mother's head!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.237
Where did you take them?
Excuse me?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.906
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.608
I'm sorry, Detective,
I don't.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.131
I know you're involved in some
secret government organization.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.741
I don't know what you think
you're doing here,

11:35.820 --> 11:38.744
but you better get out of my office
before you find yourself under arrest.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.414
- You're Wesen. And I know it.
- Let's go.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.711
Tell me where she is!

11:43.786 --> 11:45.083
Escort him out
of the building.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.380
If he resists, arrest him.
Get off...

11:46.456 --> 11:47.958
Take it easy.
You don't know who I am!

11:48.791 --> 11:50.464
Get off! Get off of me!
Let's go.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.760
Let's go.
He sounds crazy.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.962
Hey!

11:54.547 --> 11:55.594
He is.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.522
Just talked
to the Coroner.

12:03.598 --> 12:07.944
No bodies have been brought in matching
Trubel's description or Juliette's.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.030
I mean, I know she turned into
a crazed Hexenbiest killer,

12:11.105 --> 12:14.700
but I always hoped that
somehow she'd come around.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.198
Yeah, didn't we all.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.492
Also, no heads in a box.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.165
I guess that's the good news.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.076
There's more bad?

12:23.159 --> 12:26.129
Another body was found in another
house across the street from Nick's.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.957
That makes three. it was
reported as a home invasion.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.550
Don't suppose we
can set them straight.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.128
Well, I saw those guys
coming towards Nick's house

12:33.211 --> 12:34.428
just before we got out.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.888
At least we know where
they were coming from.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.592
It's Nick.
Finally.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.686
Where have you been?
Chavez knows.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.769
You saw her?
Had a little chat.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.600
Look, Nick, there's
other stuff going on.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.027
What did you
find out about her?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.695
Not much. But you got
to come in here.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.651
I need to know
where Chavez lives.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.858
Forget about her for a second,
and get in here.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.860
Three of your neighbors
were killed last night.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.662
What? it has to be those
guys I saw coming for us.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.365
All right, I'm coming in.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.872
"The suspect's body who we now believe
is our Jack the Ripper copy-cat

13:04.951 --> 13:07.204
"was discovered
late last night..."

13:08.371 --> 13:09.418
Yeah.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.546
Special Agent Chavez from the
FBI is on the phone for you.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.219
I'll take it.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.473
This is Captain Renard.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.055
Captain, I wish I had
a better reason to call you.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.180
What's the problem?

13:26.264 --> 13:28.813
Your Detective Burkhardt
was in my office this morning.

13:28.891 --> 13:32.646
He made some accusations which lead me
to believe he's under a lot of stress.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.527
He's had some
family problems recently.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.107
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
to hear that,

13:36.190 --> 13:39.490
but his behavior in my office
was unbalanced and threatening.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.412
We almost had to place
him under arrest.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.208
I'd like to leave
this in your hands,

13:46.159 --> 13:48.582
but if this happens again,
it'll be out of my hands.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.254
And he will find
himself in jail.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.141
I'll make sure
it doesn't happen again.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.583
Good.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.889
Just made a call to my...

14:01.007 --> 14:02.099
Who was killed?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.639
Haven't got names yet,

14:03.718 --> 14:05.078
two on the south-side
corner house,

14:05.094 --> 14:06.892
and one in the garage
at the west-side corner house.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.224
That must have been how they controlled
the area to get to my mother.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.436
Obviously the Royal Family wasn't
worried about collateral damage.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.519
Hey, Nick.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.303
I need to see
you in my office.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.593
Yeah, I need to talk
to you, too.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.863
What are you doing? What
are you talking about?

14:19.942 --> 14:22.912
You confronted Special Agent Chavez
in her own office, with witnesses.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.988
What the hell
were you thinking?

14:24.072 --> 14:25.198
Captain, you
don't understand...

14:25.281 --> 14:26.321
Maybe I do, maybe I don't,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.084
but you might just get yourself
arrested on federal charges

14:28.159 --> 14:29.331
if you don't stop
what you're doing.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.410
Chavez is part of a secret
government organization.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.455
What organization, Nick?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.698
I don't know, but that's what
I'm trying to figure out.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.884
Last night, they took Juliette's
body, they took Trubel...

14:36.959 --> 14:39.132
Stop. I've been told,
we're going to look into it.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.429
You don't believe me?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.932
A lot has happened and
you have to take some time.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.180
No, I don't need time...
This is not a suggestion.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.433
Are you suspending me?

14:48.805 --> 14:51.479
No, I'm telling you
to take some time.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.893
Now if you don't,
then I will suspend you.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.603
Captain, you don't understand
what Chavez is...

14:55.686 --> 14:57.438
Enough. You go
near her again,

14:57.522 --> 14:59.820
and you'll be facing
a lot more than a suspension.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.323
That didn't go well.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.955
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hold on. Slow down.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.753
I've been ordered
to take some time off.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.502
Well, you've been going through
a lot, that wouldn't be a bad idea.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.754
How can I take time when
I know what's going on?

15:17.834 --> 15:19.677
Hey, listen, man. Listen.
We just want to help.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.972
You don't believe me, either.

15:31.806 --> 15:32.853
Now what?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.526
Got to get some help.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.997
What are you doing?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.953
What do you mean "what am I doing"?
I'm opening the shop.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.208
I already did that.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.170
You just made us closed again.
I did?

16:02.378 --> 16:07.054
I don't think I can focus on Spice
and Tea, I mean Juliette's dead?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.597
And somebody took Trubel?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.895
How did this happen,
just since last night?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.598
Look, obviously we're only
getting part of the story.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.771
I mean, Nick was way
fried when he called,

16:16.851 --> 16:19.730
so I think we're just gonna
have to, you know,

16:19.812 --> 16:22.031
take all this with a very
large grain of salt.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.655
If Juliette's dead,
Juliette's dead.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.986
Nick wouldn't just
make that up

16:26.068 --> 16:28.787
and he certainly wouldn't call and
tell us that if it's not true.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.160
Okay, look.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.413
The last thing we knew, she was
getting on that helicopter.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.753
Oh, my God,
the helicopter crashed.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.830
No, but he didn't say
anything about a helicopter,

16:37.914 --> 16:39.666
he just said
"they took her body".

16:39.749 --> 16:42.127
Who? Who took her body?

16:42.251 --> 16:43.844
I assume whoever
killed her.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.762
Unless she died of natural
causes which is highly unlikely,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.513
considering what
she was at the end.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.641
So whoever killed her
took her body and Trubel?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.181
And his mom's head.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.106
This does not make
any sense.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.018
What, they just all happen to be in
the same place at the same time,

16:59.101 --> 17:00.978
like some sick scavenger hunt?

17:01.062 --> 17:02.279
It's Hank.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.192
Hank, what the hell
is going on?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.323
Have you talked to Nick?
Oh, yeah.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.696
That doesn't sound like
a very good "oh, yeah".

17:10.820 --> 17:11.867
It's not.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.244
Is Juliette
really dead?

17:13.657 --> 17:15.955
I think so, but I'm not sure
about anything anymore.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.833
Are you guys at the shop?
Yes.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.548
Wu and I are coming over,
we need your help.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.830
Nick.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.579
Juliette!

17:57.451 --> 17:59.044
Nick.
Juliette?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.200
I can't do this.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.460
Wait a minute, if he didn't see
this FBI agent at his house,

18:46.542 --> 18:48.089
how can he be
so sure it's her?

18:48.169 --> 18:50.129
Because nothing else makes
sense to him right now,

18:50.171 --> 18:52.299
but I'm not sure anything
else makes sense right now.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.382
And he's not answering.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.811
Well, the least we can do for Nick is
find out what we can about Chavez.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.600
Just can't do it
at the precinct.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.181
They took Juliette's body?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.813
He can't even bury her, this is just...
It's horrible.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.441
Well, Nick dying would
have been horrible, too.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.646
What?

19:06.729 --> 19:08.481
Not to speak ill
of the dead,

19:08.564 --> 19:10.612
I'm just saying, better
Juliette than Nick.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.327
I mean, you know, if it
had to be one of them.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.154
None of this was
Juliette's fault,

19:15.237 --> 19:17.740
she didn't become a Hexenbiest
because she wanted to.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.410
Well, she did sort of
embrace it once she did.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.245
And Juliette was
trying to kill him.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.833
That is not
what I'm saying.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.958
We were all a part of
what happened to her.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.089
She was trying to do what she
thought was right for Nick,

19:29.168 --> 19:30.636
what we all thought
was right.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.510
Honey, she knew there
were risks, and...

19:33.589 --> 19:35.466
it doesn't mean she
gets all the blame.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.766
Hell no.
Nobody's saying that.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.763
It's just a bad deal.
All around.

19:40.471 --> 19:41.597
Yeah.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.315
I just... Just...

19:44.350 --> 19:46.523
I was starting to miss
the old Juliette and now,

19:47.103 --> 19:51.609
this has happened and it just, it
feels, it feels so final, you know?

19:51.857 --> 19:55.452
I just wish I'd had a chance
to say some kind of goodbye.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.865
Look. You guys, the point is he
feels responsible for Trubel,

19:59.407 --> 20:00.954
if she's even still alive.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.712
So, it makes sense, you know, he's
grasping at whatever straw he can find.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.006
Got some stuff on Chavez. What?

20:07.289 --> 20:09.383
Chavez has an exemplary
record with the Bureau.

20:09.458 --> 20:13.258
Five years ago, she was given the FBI
Award for Meritorious Achievement.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.472
Got an address?
I do.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.849
In Eastmoreland.

20:17.925 --> 20:21.099
I better head over there before he
decides to do something stupid.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.976
You know what,
let me go.

20:23.681 --> 20:24.978
It'll be less official.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.600
You want me
to go with you?

20:26.684 --> 20:28.152
No, I should probably
do this alone.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.817
I mean, besides, he might
not even be there.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.032
And how do we find out about
this secret government agency

20:34.108 --> 20:36.531
that is supposedly
interested in Grimms?

20:37.528 --> 20:38.950
Probably not on the Internet.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.078
Maybe the Wesen Council
knows something.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.877
Although I doubt they'd
tell me if they did.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.754
Trubel told Nick that Chavez is
involved with this group, right?

20:46.829 --> 20:49.252
Yeah. Well, Chavez is the
only name we've got.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.842
Then we keep digging.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.538
Any changes?

21:25.868 --> 21:27.120
Not for the better.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.834
We're playing with fire.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.216
We're going to need fire.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.876
Dude. You need to
answer your phone.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.124
What are you
doing here?

22:09.328 --> 22:12.377
I just... I came to see if, you
know, you needed any help.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.083
No, I don't.
So, thanks.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.724
Nick, seriously,
what are you going to do?

22:17.795 --> 22:19.797
I mean, I realize you
don't have to answer me,

22:19.880 --> 22:23.225
but don't forget I helped
you into this world, okay.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.808
I've known you as a Grimm
longer than anyone.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.436
So if anybody's going to
believe you, it's gonna be me.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.354
Okay? We've been
through a lot together.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.936
And I don't want to
see you do something,

22:34.019 --> 22:36.238
you know, without me
if you really need me.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.485
I appreciate that.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.951
But you can't be part of this,
not until I'm sure.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.278
Now get out of here.
Nick.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.783
Get out of here!

23:00.880 --> 23:02.120
I'm a little low
on Maple syrup,

23:02.172 --> 23:03.765
but I've got plenty
of raspberry jam.

23:03.966 --> 23:07.186
Which, you know, a lot of people prefer.
I'm not one of them.

23:07.261 --> 23:08.934
Anything is fine, thanks.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.264
Yeah.

23:13.976 --> 23:17.606
Look, you can't dwell on what you
hoped was gonna happen with Diana.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.110
I mean,
Nick really tried.

23:20.691 --> 23:21.692
I know.

23:22.693 --> 23:25.446
And don't forget, you're
not just eating for one.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.407
I mean, this is
my family's recipe.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.330
And believe me, you haven't
lived until you've had...

23:30.409 --> 23:31.410
Bud!

23:31.493 --> 23:32.493
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.630
I didn't mean to over...
Oversell. You just eat.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.924
Or not. I'll just shut up.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.046
The baby.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.425
What... What about the baby?

23:39.501 --> 23:41.549
It feels a little
uncomfortable.

23:42.046 --> 23:43.593
Like, like, like what?

23:43.672 --> 23:45.390
Like, like he's starting to...

23:45.466 --> 23:47.935
He's starting to...
He's starting to...

23:48.010 --> 23:49.011
Oh, my God.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.139
Oh, my God. He's coming.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.223
I got to call Nick!

23:53.307 --> 23:55.685
No! You're not calling anybody,
you're getting me to the hospital!

23:55.768 --> 23:57.111
Get the car!
Okay.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.984
Now!
All right. Okay! Get the car.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.423
I'll get the car.
I'll get the car.

24:02.858 --> 24:07.785
Okay. Chavez graduated with a degree in
Criminology and did the Quantico training.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.490
That's normal, that's
what she should be doing.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.995
We have to look
beyond normal.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.874
We have to find someone or
something that ties her into this group.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.421
Hey, did you find him?
Oh, yeah.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.373
At Chavez' house?
He was there.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.584
And he didn't
want me involved.

24:19.667 --> 24:23.217
So whatever he's doing,
he's doing on his own.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.552
I don't know...

24:25.923 --> 24:28.517
But this is getting
real serious, real fast.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.933
I know you're Wesen.
I'm a Grimm.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.811
That's all I needed.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.686
Here's something about her parents, they
were both in the diplomatic service.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.322
Looks like her schooling took place
wherever they were stationed.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.276
Well. That would put her in
contact with all kinds of people.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.654
Until they were killed in a
terrorist attack in Beirut.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.364
She was a senior
in high school.

25:31.447 --> 25:36.123
Good motivation to join the FBI, but it
doesn't explain what's going on now.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.329
I'll get it.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.637
Spice and Tea. Nick?

25:47.129 --> 25:48.130
Where are you?

25:49.006 --> 25:51.100
Here? Okay,
I'll unlock it.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.761
Nick's here.
At the back door!

26:00.768 --> 26:01.894
Oh, my God.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.274
You kidnapped Chavez?

26:03.353 --> 26:04.525
And brought her here?

26:04.605 --> 26:05.652
Lock the door.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.324
What have
you done?

26:11.737 --> 26:13.580
She's a Wesen,
just like Trubel said.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.620
What is she?
Steinadler.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.856
Who the hell are
you working for?

26:19.161 --> 26:20.834
You made a big
mistake, Burkhardt.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.915
The only mistake I made was
not doing anything about you

26:22.998 --> 26:24.466
when Trubel told
me what you did.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.678
You tried to recruit
her once before.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.174
You threatened her if she told me.
Well, guess what, she told me.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.823
You saw one of these books in my
house, you thought it was hers.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.603
It was mine.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.856
If you were looking for a
Grimm, it's me. Not her.

26:43.936 --> 26:47.361
Wait. I saw the same
book in her room.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.359
I left it on her bed.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.029
Somebody moved it.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.160
That's why you came to the
precinct, to talk to him.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.617
You weren't trying to find out about
your fellow agent Weston Steward,

26:57.699 --> 26:59.417
you wanted to find out
if Nick was a Grimm.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.295
Weston Steward was
working for the Royals,

27:05.374 --> 27:07.092
that's why he shot
Captain Renard.

27:07.835 --> 27:08.927
You ever figure that out?

27:13.048 --> 27:15.050
You might wanna think
about coming clean.

27:16.510 --> 27:19.810
Unless you've killed Trubel. Then you
really don't want to come clean.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.689
You're not going anywhere
until we get the truth.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.527
My life doesn't matter.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.531
There's too much at stake.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.492
Well, somebody's going to have
to start trusting somebody.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.835
It's Bud.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.588
Nick, you've got
to take it.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.172
Bud, everything okay?
No, no!

27:53.255 --> 27:55.599
Adalind... Adalind went into
labor, she's having your baby!

27:55.674 --> 27:58.018
Now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now!

27:58.093 --> 27:59.561
Where are you?
St. Joe's.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.728
You got to be here.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.190
Oh, Nick, Nick, it's
happening, hurry up!

28:07.269 --> 28:08.566
Adalind's in labor.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.151
Bud's at the hospital.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.946
Now? Nick, you've got to go.

28:16.737 --> 28:18.910
Don't worry about her, man.
She's not going anywhere.

28:28.582 --> 28:29.959
You all know he's a Grimm.

28:30.417 --> 28:34.012
Oh, we do, and we don't
like secrets very much.

28:36.089 --> 28:38.638
I was thinking my partner
had gone over the edge.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.270
I'm not thinking
that anymore.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.942
Oh! I'm so glad you're here.
It's all happened just so fast.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.277
I was just making
her some food

28:56.360 --> 28:58.203
and all of a sudden, the kid
is knocking on the door.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.701
I mean, my wife never missed
a meal to have a kid.

29:00.781 --> 29:03.000
It was always after eating.
She's in labor now?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.918
Oh, yeah.
It started in my car.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.586
Her water broke
on the sidewalk.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.255
I didn't think we
were gonna make it.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.504
Uh, hi, this is Nick Burkhardt,
he's the father of Adalind.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.836
No, I meant, he's...
He's the father's baby.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.121
No, no, he's the baby's...
I got it. You're the father.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.171
Yes.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.932
She's in delivery now.
Are you going in?

29:20.509 --> 29:21.977
To the delivery room?

29:22.386 --> 29:24.684
Of course you're going in.
That's why you're here.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.023
I'll come with you.
Let's go.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.942
I'm so glad you
didn't miss it.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.527
I was in for all of mine.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.191
It's really something to see.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.856
And hear, actually.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.150
The language is something
you're never gonna forget!

29:39.111 --> 29:40.237
You Okay?

29:41.029 --> 29:42.622
I don't know, it's
happening very fast.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.787
Try not to deal with
all that right now.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.334
Just concentrate on this.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.959
No matter what's happened, this
child is going to need you.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.376
Yeah, what about Adalind?

29:50.455 --> 29:51.615
She's going to need you, too.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.467
It's gonna be awkward,
but this kid comes first.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.886
I'm not even sure
I should be doing this.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.135
Nick, listen to me,
you're going to be a dad.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.634
I know this is not how anybody
thought this was going to happen,

30:01.717 --> 30:03.264
but still, it is still
pretty special.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.023
And I think you're going
to be great at it.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.662
Monroe and I are going to be
there for you as much as we can.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.230
Come on, push!

30:14.980 --> 30:16.778
You've got it,
just push.

30:18.025 --> 30:19.402
Come on!

30:22.529 --> 30:23.997
Nick, you're here...

30:24.865 --> 30:27.305
You're doing good, it's
going good, just keep pushing.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.043
How much longer?

30:33.123 --> 30:34.875
You're doing fine,
just take a breath.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.130
Doctor.
It's okay.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.253
The heart rate's dropped
from 160 to 120.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.714
Keep an eye on it.

30:41.882 --> 30:42.929
Okay, Adalind.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.557
It's still dropping, heart rate is 60.
It's not rebounding.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.979
Get her on O2, now.
Run fluids.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.230
It's stopped.
It's coming again!

30:52.309 --> 30:53.401
No, no, no, no! Don't push!

30:53.518 --> 30:55.361
We
lost the baby's heartbeat.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.814
Get her on her side! Now!

30:56.897 --> 30:58.097
What's happening?
I don't know.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.107
Back please.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.192
Something's
stressing the baby.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.198
We're going to have to do
an emergency C-section.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.158
Here you go.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.627
Team,
set up in OR Two.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.709
Put the side rails up.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.376
Truth is not always easy
to come by in our business

31:17.459 --> 31:18.676
when you know what we know.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.466
No, it's not.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.344
The evidence doesn't
tell the whole truth.

31:24.466 --> 31:27.310
The whole truth would be
terrifying for most people.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.434
Look, do you have
Trubel or not?

31:30.680 --> 31:31.897
I can't say.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.145
You just did.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.311
Maybe that's
the best I can do.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.571
Nick is not going to let you go
unless you tell him where she is.

31:43.819 --> 31:48.575
If I don't answer that, someone
will start looking for me.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.001
And it won't be the FBI.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.638
If I don't like
anything you say,

32:05.048 --> 32:07.801
they can look all they want,
but they'll never find you.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.349
Don't answer it.

32:12.139 --> 32:14.437
I need to send my thumb print,
so they know it's me.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.421
Wait a minute. How do we know she
didn't just send a distress signal?

32:35.787 --> 32:36.959
You don't.

32:37.038 --> 32:39.882
But somebody's got to start
trusting somebody, right?

32:47.340 --> 32:48.387
Yeah.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.218
I'm okay.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.053
I got delayed.

32:53.889 --> 32:57.018
I was wrong about Burkhardt,
he is a Grimm.

32:58.602 --> 32:59.945
No, I'm positive.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.782
And I want to bring him in...

33:05.567 --> 33:06.568
Tonight.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.368
Specialist to the Nursery.

33:10.447 --> 33:13.496
Any available lactation
specialists, report to the Nursery.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.918
What the hell is
taking so long?

33:15.076 --> 33:17.044
I don't know,
Nick, wish I did.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.664
I've got to see
if they're okay.

33:18.747 --> 33:19.964
Nick, don't.

33:20.749 --> 33:21.829
There's nothing you can do.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.553
Hank, I'm with Rosalee,
you're on speaker.

33:28.632 --> 33:29.633
How's it going?

33:29.716 --> 33:31.389
I don't know,
there's complications.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.019
Sorry.

33:33.595 --> 33:34.892
Chavez wants
to talk to you.

33:35.597 --> 33:36.769
Did she tell you anything?

33:37.891 --> 33:39.188
You need to talk to her.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.279
This is your one chance
to get the answers.

33:47.734 --> 33:51.329
You come with me. Alone.
And we leave in 20 minutes.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.496
After that,
it'll be too late.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.620
Nick, go.
I'll stay with Adalind.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.548
I'll meet you there.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.639
I'll call you as soon
as I know something.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.719
Nick, I'm not so sure
about this.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.349
She talked to somebody on the phone,
and we didn't hear what they said.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.554
He's right, Nick. This
could all be a set up.

34:16.638 --> 34:18.958
She had to use her thumb
print to answer the phone.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.317
We're running
out of time.

34:21.141 --> 34:22.985
You took Trubel once
and you let her go.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.609
I did.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.407
Let's go.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.744
Uh...

34:38.827 --> 34:40.170
We're just going
to do nothing?

34:40.328 --> 34:41.750
For a couple
of hours, yeah.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.629
That's about as long
as my trust lasts.

34:52.549 --> 34:53.675
Stop.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.016
We walk from here.
Wait.

34:58.847 --> 34:59.848
Who's in there?

35:00.640 --> 35:02.392
You wanted to find out
who I'm working with.

35:02.475 --> 35:04.227
You're gonna find out.
But how many?

35:04.853 --> 35:06.070
I'm not sure.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.482
We're never all together
in the same place.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.202
But things are happening.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.867
We have to be prepared.
For what?

35:17.032 --> 35:18.204
What's coming.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.210
I can't tell you anymore.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.092
Are you sure
they're here?

35:47.729 --> 35:48.821
They're here.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.704
Oh, God.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.672
Oh, no.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.515
Who are they?

36:17.008 --> 36:18.260
Who we were meeting with.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.265
We have to go.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.642
Don't.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.166
No, we need to get
you to a hospital.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.526
You can't be
tied to this.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.654
Where is Trubel? Where did you take her?

38:02.906 --> 38:06.160
They're coming
here to Portland.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.368
Where is she?

38:08.286 --> 38:09.538
They're rising.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.544
Everywhere.

38:24.511 --> 38:25.683
It's war.

38:49.244 --> 38:50.416
Where are you?

38:52.622 --> 38:53.839
She's dead.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.171
Who is this?

38:57.752 --> 38:59.800
The others were dead when we got here.
Who is this?

39:02.090 --> 39:03.182
Keep the phone.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.472
Baby's all right.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.190
What about Adalind?

39:11.933 --> 39:14.436
She's exhausted,
but she's okay.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.230
What happened?

39:18.022 --> 39:19.649
The baby's arm
was above his head.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.279
It was blocking
him from coming out.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.117
I can go
in there, right?

39:25.822 --> 39:27.244
Yeah, I think
she'd like that.

39:29.784 --> 39:30.831
Thanks for being here.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.269
You Okay?

39:53.850 --> 39:55.022
Better now.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.483
I wasn't sure
you'd want to be here.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.285
I don't know, maybe you
don't want to be here,

40:09.657 --> 40:11.534
but at least you're here.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.873
Don't hate me
anymore, Nick.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.460
For our son's sake,
we can't be like we were.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.597
I don't want to
raise him by myself.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.682
He's as much
of you as he is me.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.111
I don't know if that's
good on either side.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.732
Well, maybe he won't be
like either one of us.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.285
I know I can't force
you to be there for him.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.030
I will be.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.083
You wanna hold him?

40:59.582 --> 41:00.708
He won't break.
