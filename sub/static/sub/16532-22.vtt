WEBVTT

00:03.560 --> 00:04.260
What's cooking?

00:04.360 --> 00:06.760
My mother's recipe...
Guinea-pig pie.

00:07.070 --> 00:07.670
Smells good.

00:07.890 --> 00:09.580
You just accept that?
It's pecan.

00:09.590 --> 00:11.690
How cuckoo do you think
my country is?

00:11.690 --> 00:12.950
It's come to this...

00:12.960 --> 00:14.420
"what's cooking"
and "smells good"

00:14.430 --> 00:15.390
gets me in trouble?

00:15.540 --> 00:16.580
Mom, you're already
cooking for tomorrow?

00:17.130 --> 00:18.230
Don't make a big deal.

00:18.230 --> 00:20.100
My baby's graduating.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.800
He won the award for
integrity and character.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.070
"No absents, no tardies,

00:25.070 --> 00:27.970
respectful to students
and teachers alike."

00:27.970 --> 00:29.170
My school
had an award like that,

00:29.170 --> 00:30.740
but instead of a sash, that kid

00:30.740 --> 00:31.840
got a punch in the mouth.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.440
Proud of you, though.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.340
Why do all your stories
involve a punch in the face,

00:35.350 --> 00:37.850
a shifty European, or a broad
who's been around the block?

00:37.850 --> 00:40.480
That reminds me of when I had to
rough up this Italian kid

00:40.480 --> 00:41.950
because he didn't want me
dating his sister.

00:41.950 --> 00:43.850
She was no nun!

00:43.850 --> 00:45.320
Jay, can you please
take care of the steaks?
Sure.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.120
On the Eve of your big day,

00:47.120 --> 00:48.860
we're celebrating with rib eyes,

00:48.860 --> 00:51.190
and you and I are gonna have
our first scotch.

00:51.190 --> 00:52.690
Really?!
Yeah.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.130
I've been waiting to open
a special bottle.

00:55.130 --> 00:57.970
Huh. Looks like
the mice got into it.

00:57.970 --> 01:00.040
Hello, hello?!
Where's my son?

01:00.040 --> 01:01.270
- Dad!
- Ha ha ha!

01:01.270 --> 01:02.670
What, did he hop the gate?

01:02.670 --> 01:04.170
You came!

01:04.170 --> 01:05.269
I said I'd come.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.810
I know, but you came!

01:06.810 --> 01:08.010
How could I miss it?

01:08.010 --> 01:09.950
Manny, the first member
of my family

01:09.950 --> 01:11.780
to ever graduate
from high school.
Wait a minute.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.880
Don't you have a brother
in Colombia who's a doctor?
Yes.

01:14.890 --> 01:18.020
He just does orthopedic surgery,
no brain or heart.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.220
Think of it...
Tomorrow, I will watch you

01:19.220 --> 01:21.160
stride across the stage
with a sash,

01:21.160 --> 01:22.560
like a rebel's bandolier

01:22.560 --> 01:25.630
telling the world
"no absents, no tardies."

01:25.630 --> 01:27.060
Manny and I were
gonna grill some steaks

01:27.060 --> 01:29.160
and drink some, um, beers.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.170
Thank you, Jay,
but if it's all right with you,

01:31.170 --> 01:32.470
I would like to take Manny out

01:32.470 --> 01:35.200
for a special
father-son celebration.

01:35.210 --> 01:36.710
Is that okay?

01:36.710 --> 01:40.140
Ah, sure. I mean, he...
Made the effort to come.

01:40.140 --> 01:41.580
Didn't have time to button
his shirt all the way up.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.580
But... Go ahead.

01:43.580 --> 01:44.880
Perfect!
The night begins.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.080
But first... Here.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.090
Walk through this.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.360
I know that smells terrible,

01:53.360 --> 01:56.890
but I've never seen that man
get a mosquito bite.

01:58.090 --> 02:01.930
There he is... the graduate.

02:01.930 --> 02:05.100
I have one word for you, Luke...
Plastics.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.370
I don't think
he knows that movie, honey.

02:06.370 --> 02:08.400
Mrs. Dunphy,
you're trying to seduce me.

02:08.410 --> 02:10.509
Okay, let's just give him
the gift, all right?

02:10.509 --> 02:12.040
Okay, but first,
gather around, everybody!

02:12.040 --> 02:14.040
Riddle me this...

02:14.040 --> 02:17.080
What has two hands, is wound
tight, and has a lot of ticks?

02:17.080 --> 02:18.250
Alex?

02:18.250 --> 02:19.450
Good guess, but no.

02:19.450 --> 02:20.680
This was made in Switzerland,

02:20.680 --> 02:22.450
not in the Disneyland hotel.

02:23.050 --> 02:24.420
Awesome! A watch!

02:24.420 --> 02:25.690
We wanted
to give it to you early

02:25.690 --> 02:27.360
so you could wear it
to graduation today.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.720
Yeah.
It's shockproof.

02:28.730 --> 02:30.360
Oh, good. You can
show it your grades.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.760
I love it.
What time is it?

02:31.760 --> 02:33.630
Time for my little man

02:33.630 --> 02:35.800
to go out in the world
and make his mark

02:35.800 --> 02:37.600
like the tiny trouper
he used to be.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.770
Hold on.
I'll be right back.

02:38.770 --> 02:39.870
I remember when he was so small,

02:39.870 --> 02:41.700
we'd give him a bath
in the sink.

02:41.710 --> 02:43.810
Here we go.
Dad, we really got to
talk about the crying.

02:43.810 --> 02:46.270
When we graduated, you were
a mess, and it was humiliating.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.810
Showing emotion is part
of being a sexy modern man.

02:48.810 --> 02:50.810
Ask anyone who was
raised on Alan alda.

02:50.810 --> 02:52.250
I don't think we have to worry

02:52.250 --> 02:54.050
about him going anywhere
anytime soon.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.380
He just installed a mini fridge
and a hammock in his room.

02:56.390 --> 02:59.150
Mom, dad,
you did all the hard work

02:59.160 --> 03:00.560
getting me through high school.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.960
You deserve a gift.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.960
But what do you get
the Cadillac of parents?

03:04.960 --> 03:06.430
A Rolls-Royce.

03:06.430 --> 03:08.000
Oh, my goodness!

03:08.000 --> 03:09.130
How did you afford that?

03:09.130 --> 03:11.270
- It was only $2,000.
- Huh.

03:11.270 --> 03:14.570
Judge Thompson, from the club,
got me into a police auction.

03:14.570 --> 03:17.340
If I had 40 more dollars,
you'd be looking at a speedboat.

03:17.340 --> 03:18.840
So, what do you think?

03:18.840 --> 03:21.740
It's... It's wow.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.010
Right?!
Hmm.

03:23.010 --> 03:24.250
I loved the macaroni necklace

03:24.250 --> 03:25.950
he made me in first grade,

03:25.950 --> 03:28.480
and I even used the perfume
he gave me in fifth grade,

03:28.490 --> 03:31.120
but this car is so gaudy.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.920
People are gonna think I played
for the Knicks in the '70s.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.490
It's the most beautiful gesture

03:36.490 --> 03:37.930
I have ever seen.

03:37.930 --> 03:39.760
It's 100% class.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.860
Hey, mom, didn't you say
you had some errands to run?

03:43.630 --> 03:46.270
Oh. I...
In a little while.

03:46.270 --> 03:48.000
Uh, s... yeah, but...
Um, gosh, it's got fur. Wow.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.710
It's like driving a lion.

03:50.710 --> 03:53.010
Hey, before you go,
give us a honk.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.610
All right.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.820
The horn doesn't help, does it?

04:14.430 --> 04:15.560
So, I've narrowed it down to

04:15.570 --> 04:17.170
Swiss coffee
and whispering white.

04:17.170 --> 04:19.470
But I can't decide
between matte or satin.

04:19.470 --> 04:20.740
I thought we landed on eggshell.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.400
We decided against eggshell.

04:22.410 --> 04:23.810
W-why don't we just
sell the house?

04:23.810 --> 04:25.070
Why don't we just paint
the floor eggshell

04:25.080 --> 04:26.510
since that's what
I'm walking on.

04:26.510 --> 04:28.140
Okay.
I forgot to
give this to you.

04:28.150 --> 04:29.580
Oh, thank you. Have a good day
at school, sweetie.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.410
Bye, sweetie.
It's fourth grade.

04:31.410 --> 04:34.080
We're all just
treading water.
What is it?

04:34.080 --> 04:36.320
Ah, well, it's... it's
from the principal's office.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.920
Is she in trouble?

04:37.920 --> 04:40.520
No!
She's... Smart.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.090
She is?
That's what it says.

04:42.090 --> 04:43.320
Are you sure it's not
for Lily rosen?

04:43.330 --> 04:44.490
You were at that science fair.

04:44.490 --> 04:45.730
She brought that frog
back to life!

04:45.730 --> 04:47.200
This is for our Lily.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.700
T-they're suggesting
that she skip fifth grade

04:48.700 --> 04:50.670
and go right into middle school
next year.

04:50.670 --> 04:53.230
"Lily is testing far above
her grade level...
What?"

04:53.240 --> 04:54.770
and we feel she would benefit

04:54.770 --> 04:56.700
"from a more challenging
curriculum."

04:56.710 --> 04:58.770
- Huh.
- I know!

04:58.780 --> 05:00.940
All these years we thought
that she was, uh...

05:00.940 --> 05:02.210
God, what's the word?

05:02.210 --> 05:04.610
Different? Peculiar?

05:04.610 --> 05:06.250
Odd? Mean?

05:06.250 --> 05:09.020
So many words.
But she was just really smart.

05:09.020 --> 05:11.090
Holed up in her room every day
after school, she wasn't...

05:11.090 --> 05:13.560
Plotting to kill us?
I was gonna say
daydreaming.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.920
They... they want us to tour
the school today if possible.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.590
This is so exciting.
I know.

05:17.590 --> 05:19.430
Our little baby's a genius!

05:19.430 --> 05:22.260
You know, um,
I also skipped a grade.

05:22.270 --> 05:23.870
I'm not saying
I was a genius, but...

05:23.870 --> 05:25.700
Good, because we're getting
along so well right now.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.730
Oh, hey.
Hi. Hey. Hi.

05:26.740 --> 05:28.040
Hey. Hi.
Mwah!

05:28.040 --> 05:29.870
Here you go. Yeah.
Thanks so much.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.710
Hey, guess what.
They want Lily
to skip fifth grade.

05:31.710 --> 05:33.370
Traditionally, the person
who says "guess what"

05:33.380 --> 05:34.610
also gets to say the what.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.610
Wait a second.
Lily's smart?

05:36.610 --> 05:38.450
Look.
I mean,
there's proof of that?

05:38.450 --> 05:40.110
Yeah. Right there.
Yes.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.820
Huh. They asked Alex
to skip a grade, too...

05:41.820 --> 05:43.820
It's not a competition,
Claire.
But we felt

05:43.820 --> 05:45.090
that it would be too much stress

05:45.090 --> 05:47.090
to have her
with kids so much older.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.120
Good for Lily!
Yeah.

05:49.130 --> 05:53.260
I just always thought
she was, you know...

05:53.260 --> 05:55.160
So did we. Yeah.
Us too. Yeah.

05:57.030 --> 05:58.270
How was your big night
with Javier?

05:58.270 --> 06:00.440
I overindulged.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.340
Booze or burgers?
Booze.

06:02.340 --> 06:04.570
I drank so much,
I had an angry slap fight

06:04.570 --> 06:06.010
with what turned out
to be a mirror.

06:06.010 --> 06:07.780
Gloria:
Do I hear my Manny?!

06:07.780 --> 06:10.680
When you're hungover,
it's like a car alarm.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.150
Ay.<i> Ihola, papi!</i>

06:12.150 --> 06:13.820
Happy graduation day!

06:15.990 --> 06:17.190
That's delightful.

06:17.190 --> 06:18.920
I need your sash and your gown.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.260
So that I can press it.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.860
I don't want anyone
looking wrinkly.

06:23.430 --> 06:24.930
I don't mean you, but it's fun
that you're right there.

06:24.930 --> 06:27.300
I, uh, left them at school.
I'll run over there.

06:27.300 --> 06:31.930
Mama, I have a stomachache.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.440
And my ankle is broken.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.770
And you can walk
with your broken ankle?

06:40.480 --> 06:42.340
I had a cousin got out
of Vietnam that way.

06:42.350 --> 06:44.010
Whenever Manny's getting

06:44.010 --> 06:45.380
a lot of attention,

06:45.380 --> 06:47.280
Joe gets very needy...

06:47.280 --> 06:48.780
"my head," "my arm."

06:48.790 --> 06:50.390
In Colombia, we say,

06:50.390 --> 06:53.120
"if it's not bleeding,
shut your Guinea-pig hole."

06:53.120 --> 06:55.490
We actually do eat Guinea pig.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.160
Call me back, dad!

06:57.160 --> 06:58.630
It's an emergency!

06:58.630 --> 07:00.060
What's wrong?

07:00.060 --> 07:02.630
I kind of misplaced
my cap and gown and sash.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.670
Maybe they're at that strip club
you went to last night.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.570
Shh! How did you know?

07:06.570 --> 07:09.200
It's all over your face.
My shame?

07:09.210 --> 07:10.510
Glitter.
Ohh.

07:10.510 --> 07:12.240
Tell me what happened.
We picked up

07:12.240 --> 07:14.210
my graduation stuff
on the way, and...

07:14.210 --> 07:16.480
I don't know. I guess the tassel
got my dad thinking.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.910
Why didn't you leave them
in the car?

07:17.910 --> 07:19.550
I didn't want them
to get stolen.

07:19.550 --> 07:21.180
And I may have taken it out

07:21.180 --> 07:23.150
to impress a certain chyna
with a "y."

07:23.150 --> 07:24.690
I think she really liked me.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.390
I'm not gonna spoil
<i>that</i> one for ya.

07:26.390 --> 07:27.720
I graduate in five hours!

07:27.720 --> 07:29.390
We'll get you
another cap and gown.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.930
That sash has been worn
by every honoree for decades.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.490
I'm not gonna be
the one to lose it

07:33.500 --> 07:35.200
after it's survived
earthquakes and wars

07:35.200 --> 07:37.170
and the lunchroom gravy fire
of '64!

07:37.170 --> 07:39.170
Fine. Where is this place?
I don't know!

07:39.170 --> 07:41.170
I remember there was
a lot of brass and mirrors

07:41.170 --> 07:42.440
and loud '80s music.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.840
Well, that narrows it down.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.610
Wait.
Uh, it was by the airport.

07:45.610 --> 07:47.410
All right. We'll find it.
I'll take you.

07:47.410 --> 07:49.080
Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.750
Thank you, Jay.

07:51.780 --> 07:54.080
What happened to <i> him?</i>

08:00.960 --> 08:02.690
I'm back.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.430
We need to talk to you.
Sit down.

08:04.430 --> 08:06.860
What's going on?
Don't say anything.

08:06.860 --> 08:09.030
Just watch.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.430
Baby pictures of Luke?

08:10.430 --> 08:12.030
More than baby pictures.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.300
You're gonna watch Luke grow up
to sappy music.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.210
Why are you doing this?

08:17.210 --> 08:18.610
To get all the crying
out of your system

08:18.610 --> 08:20.140
so you don't melt down
at the graduation.

08:20.140 --> 08:21.440
It's like when
you drink too much

08:21.440 --> 08:22.910
and your friends
get you super-wasted

08:22.910 --> 08:25.480
so you never drink again
for the rest of the week.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.450
It's the first time he saw snow.

08:27.450 --> 08:28.880
Oh, here, dad.

08:28.890 --> 08:30.820
Thank you.

08:31.690 --> 08:34.890
His baby blanket?! Why?!

08:39.360 --> 08:41.730
Hey, nice car, grey gardens!

08:41.730 --> 08:44.970
It was a gift from my son!

08:44.970 --> 08:47.140
Ugh.

08:49.410 --> 08:51.570
What the hell?

09:01.780 --> 09:03.350
Rawrrr!

09:03.350 --> 09:05.490
You call that a tiger?

09:05.490 --> 09:09.690
R-a-a-a-awrrr!

09:11.160 --> 09:12.460
And we're very proud

09:12.460 --> 09:14.030
of our state-of-the-art
computer lab.

09:14.030 --> 09:16.430
It's so weird... every time
I step into a middle school,

09:16.430 --> 09:18.600
I feel like I'm 14
Ag-a-in.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.200
That... Was on me.
He wasn't gonna do anything.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.470
How much is his therapy
costing again?

09:23.470 --> 09:25.510
We used to think that was snark.

09:25.510 --> 09:27.040
Now we know it's wit.
Yeah.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.540
Uh, Mr. Peterson,
we just want to be certain

09:29.550 --> 09:31.810
that this environment's
the right fit for Lily.

09:31.820 --> 09:33.280
We have a lot of experience

09:33.280 --> 09:35.350
dealing with
accelerated students.

09:35.350 --> 09:37.050
But if Lily really is gifted,

09:37.050 --> 09:40.050
then maybe there's another
path... private schools.

09:40.060 --> 09:42.720
Although, I do love the
diversity of a public school.

09:42.730 --> 09:44.660
On the other hand,
I do wonder...
okay, you know what?

09:44.660 --> 09:47.030
We're just deciding
if she's gonna skip a grade.

09:47.030 --> 09:48.660
We're not charting out
the next 20 years of her life.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.470
Well, no, choices
have consequences.

09:50.470 --> 09:51.970
If we don't do this right,

09:51.970 --> 09:54.040
she could lose all interest
in school and drop out,

09:54.040 --> 09:55.640
and the next thing you know,
we're supporting her

09:55.640 --> 09:57.240
and her deadbeat boyfriend
and our savings are drained,

09:57.240 --> 09:58.540
and then we have to
sell the house!

09:58.540 --> 10:00.140
Okay, why do all
your meltdowns have to do

10:00.140 --> 10:01.810
with us
selling the house?
I'm just saying...

10:01.810 --> 10:03.180
We're gonna give you guys
a minute, okay?
Okay.

10:03.180 --> 10:05.580
Lily, do you want to see
the computer lab?

10:05.580 --> 10:09.250
This feels like a good time
to tell you I'm adopted.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.820
Maybe Claire's right.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.720
Maybe it's too much pressure
for her to skip a grade.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.560
I did it, and I'm fine.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.690
Uh-huh.

10:17.090 --> 10:19.560
I'm sorry. Um...
Hey, w-what does "uh-huh" mean?

10:19.560 --> 10:21.860
Well, perhaps you're not
the... Best advertisement

10:21.870 --> 10:23.560
for skipping a grade.

10:23.570 --> 10:26.270
So, wait. You're afraid
Lily's gonna turn out like me?

10:26.270 --> 10:28.670
I'm just saying that
maybe you skipping a grade

10:28.670 --> 10:30.070
put too much pressure on you,

10:30.070 --> 10:32.170
and it exacerbated
your neurotic tendencies,

10:32.180 --> 10:34.880
and now you can't even make
a tiny, little decision

10:34.880 --> 10:37.550
about, you know...
Paint.

10:37.550 --> 10:40.380
Wow! I can...

10:40.380 --> 10:43.250
Y-you...
I don't have to just st...

10:43.250 --> 10:45.720
Oh, you think you are <i> so</i> s...

10:45.720 --> 10:47.720
You can't decide
how to storm off, can you?

10:47.720 --> 10:50.260
I am...

10:52.430 --> 10:54.530
Luke's first haircut.

10:54.530 --> 10:57.470
He gave me bangs.

10:57.470 --> 10:58.870
Well, that's it.

10:58.870 --> 11:00.640
Hopefully you're all cried out.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.270
You remember when he hid that
mouse trap under the pillow

11:03.270 --> 11:05.040
to catch the tooth fairy?

11:06.640 --> 11:08.610
Dad, we got to start getting
ready for the graduation.

11:08.610 --> 11:11.150
Yeah, so maybe splash
some cold water on your face

11:11.150 --> 11:12.650
and wrap it up.

11:12.650 --> 11:15.780
Do you guys remember that
"Luke loves daddy" rap?

11:22.160 --> 11:23.760
I thought you said
he'd be cried out by now.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.730
Dad, please,
you really got to stop.

11:25.730 --> 11:29.100
That's what he said when
I was the tickle monster!

11:29.100 --> 11:32.170
Ohh!

11:32.170 --> 11:35.340
Mama, now my tooth hurts.

11:35.340 --> 11:37.840
Well, I guess you can't
have cake today.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.970
What if it's my leg?

11:39.980 --> 11:42.680
Claire, I guess I'm picking up
the cake myself,

11:42.680 --> 11:45.410
because you didn't answer
my messages.

11:48.550 --> 11:50.650
Claire: Grawr!

11:50.650 --> 11:52.790
Gr-a-a-awr!

11:52.790 --> 11:56.620
Hey, Claire, are you
having fun at the gym town?

11:56.630 --> 11:58.460
As a matter of fact, I am.

11:58.460 --> 12:01.530
This is my new friend, Charlie.

12:01.530 --> 12:02.860
He loves dinosaurs,

12:02.870 --> 12:04.330
and tomorrow we're both
gonna have pink eye.

12:04.330 --> 12:05.770
Hi, Charlie!

12:05.770 --> 12:07.440
Can you go and find
the negligent adult

12:07.440 --> 12:08.640
that brought you here?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.500
Oh, do you have to go so soon?

12:10.510 --> 12:12.340
He smells so good!

12:12.340 --> 12:14.880
Yeah, you're like two sniffs
away from a felony.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.680
What is going on?

12:17.680 --> 12:19.950
I gave Phil such a hard time

12:19.950 --> 12:21.820
for being too emotional
about Luke's graduation,

12:21.820 --> 12:25.550
but I think it's hitting me
more than I want to admit.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.290
I know.
It happens so fast.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.320
Luke used to <i> love</i> coming here.

12:29.330 --> 12:32.060
Today he gave us
a Rolls-Royce.

12:32.060 --> 12:33.660
The one outside is yours?

12:33.660 --> 12:35.130
I thought I was gonna be able

12:35.130 --> 12:37.230
to meet
Mr. Burt Reynolds!

12:37.230 --> 12:40.970
You're lucky. When Manny goes,
you still have Joe.

12:40.970 --> 12:43.340
Yeah, but it doesn't
make it hurt any less.

12:43.340 --> 12:44.810
We just have face it...

12:44.810 --> 12:47.170
They're not boys anymore.
They're men.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.540
Luke has a job, and he's dating.

12:49.550 --> 12:52.350
He can serve on a jury.
God, that's terrifying.

12:52.350 --> 12:55.750
I know. Manny ditched us
last night to go drinking.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.850
He thinks I don't know,
but I know.

12:57.850 --> 13:00.590
He smelled like
a sweaty peppermint.

13:00.590 --> 13:03.860
I saw the pictures that he
texted Luke from the strip club.

13:04.830 --> 13:06.230
Is that where Javier took him?

13:06.230 --> 13:08.830
Oh. You did not know that.
I'm sorry.

13:08.830 --> 13:12.530
But it... it looked like one
of the classier establishments.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.740
The girl that was
sitting on Manny's lap
had on a really cute top,

13:14.740 --> 13:17.100
at... at least
in the first picture.

13:17.110 --> 13:18.510
The one time that I thought

13:18.510 --> 13:20.370
that he was going to
be a good father,

13:20.380 --> 13:22.610
and he teaches Manny
how to be a dog!

13:22.610 --> 13:23.780
I'm gonna kill him!

13:23.780 --> 13:25.050
Hey, look at me!

13:25.050 --> 13:27.420
I'm about to talk to a stranger!

13:31.350 --> 13:33.690
Oh, yes. This is it.
This is the one.

13:33.690 --> 13:36.020
Ugh. It wasn't this depressing
last night.

13:36.030 --> 13:37.590
Jay: The lunch scene
in a strip joint

13:37.590 --> 13:40.530
is like a refugee camp
with less hope.

13:40.530 --> 13:41.860
Excuse me.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.560
Uh, my friend left

13:43.570 --> 13:45.730
some personal belongings here
last night.

13:45.740 --> 13:48.570
Anything left behind, uh,
goes in the lost and found.

13:48.570 --> 13:49.940
There we go. Thank you.

13:49.940 --> 13:52.910
There's a jacket...
Glasses...

13:54.240 --> 13:56.040
hairpiece, I hope...

13:56.050 --> 13:58.250
What about <i> my</i> stuff?!
Nope.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.580
There's a lot of wedding rings
in here, though.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.050
Sir, we're in a big hurry.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.750
Have you seen a cap and gown
and sash?

14:03.750 --> 14:06.390
Man: <i>Gentlemen,
put your hands together for...</i>

14:06.390 --> 14:09.760
<i>Val the dictorian!</i>

14:15.900 --> 14:18.670
She definitely looks like
she knows stuff.

14:24.940 --> 14:26.610
Credit where credit is due...

14:26.610 --> 14:29.080
She put together a pretty solid
act in very little time.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.150
Can you just please help me
get my stuff back?

14:31.150 --> 14:32.780
Miss?

14:32.780 --> 14:35.520
Miss? Val?

14:35.520 --> 14:37.020
Hi. Heh.
Here's the thing.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.450
The gown, everything...

14:38.450 --> 14:40.250
He actually left them here
last night.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.620
Manny: I was having
a tête-à-tête with chyna.

14:42.630 --> 14:44.830
She probably mentioned me.
Hope I didn't lead her on.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.660
See, I'm going
to college soon, and I...

14:46.660 --> 14:48.160
And I don't want any loose ends.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.930
I'm in the middle of my act.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.530
Sure, but the thing is
he's got to get it back,

14:51.530 --> 14:53.770
so if you could strip a little
more in our direction...

14:56.640 --> 14:58.370
I'm such a screw-up.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.440
Huh. "Integrity."

15:02.450 --> 15:06.450
It should say
"perverted schnapps maniac."

15:06.450 --> 15:07.780
Oh, god.

15:07.780 --> 15:09.850
It smells like
miss dictorian's perfume.

15:10.890 --> 15:13.290
I can't wear this.
I'm a fraud.

15:13.290 --> 15:17.160
No absents? Oh, I've got
one big absent... my soul.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.230
Manny, you've spent your whole
life trying to be perfect,

15:19.230 --> 15:21.460
and this is throwing you
for a loop... I get it.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.460
But if you just
look around this room,

15:23.470 --> 15:26.470
you'll realize
people make mistakes.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.340
You could do way worse
than you did last night,

15:31.340 --> 15:32.970
and it ain't gonna
change a thing.

15:32.980 --> 15:36.340
So my advice... try to be
a little easier on yourself.

15:37.510 --> 15:39.980
Thanks, Jay.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.580
Oh, god, there's chyna.

15:42.590 --> 15:44.080
Pretending to ignore me!

15:44.090 --> 15:46.920
She's as transparent
as her pumps.

15:48.320 --> 15:51.190
James Earl Carter.

15:52.290 --> 15:54.060
Have you seen my booboo?

15:54.060 --> 15:56.600
Ohh! Poor baby!
Mwah.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.500
Vice principal:
Nicole Ingrid Cortez.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.240
Can you please move over?
I have to kill someone.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.380
Vice principal:
Charles mark coleson.

16:08.380 --> 16:10.440
I hope that you had fun
last night.

16:10.450 --> 16:12.580
Oh, I did.
It was a magical time.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.380
Lucy coleson.
I can't <i> believe</i> that you...

16:14.380 --> 16:16.180
Me either. Look at our son
over there, eh?

16:16.190 --> 16:18.750
He's perfect.
Yeah, and then
you come along

16:18.750 --> 16:20.550
and you expose him
to all this...
me?

16:20.560 --> 16:23.460
It was you who exposed him
to so many amazing things.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.130
You raised him to be a
wonderful man without my help.

16:26.130 --> 16:28.630
Every single thing that is good
about him is because of you.

16:28.630 --> 16:29.730
Henry coruthers.
I'm sorry?

16:29.730 --> 16:31.370
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

16:31.370 --> 16:32.800
Thank you for being the
finest mother to our son.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.300
Hmm?

16:34.300 --> 16:36.970
Damn it.
You're welcome.

16:36.970 --> 16:38.610
I'm sorry about earlier.

16:38.610 --> 16:40.110
It's not that I don't want Lily
to be like you...

16:40.110 --> 16:42.040
No, no. Hey.
You're right, okay?

16:42.040 --> 16:43.540
I'm an indecisive mess.

16:43.550 --> 16:44.780
Of course I don't want that
for her.

16:44.780 --> 16:46.110
And for the record,

16:46.120 --> 16:47.650
I don't want her to be
like me, either.

16:47.650 --> 16:49.280
Ohh!
It's not like I'm
exactly an overachiever.

16:49.290 --> 16:50.650
That's true.

16:50.650 --> 16:52.320
Yeah, you jumped on that one
pretty quick.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.220
If you care about
what I think...

16:54.220 --> 16:55.320
I want to skip.
Vice principal:
Jacob Marcus Dalton.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.460
Are you sure, sweetie?

16:56.460 --> 16:58.060
Because it's a lot of pressure.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.430
I can handle it.
But what about
all your friends?

17:00.430 --> 17:01.960
Vice principal:
Phillip Thomas darrow.
I mean, look at...
look at these kids.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.160
A lot of them have known
each other since kindergarten.

17:04.170 --> 17:07.430
I'll make new friends.
Kids really like me.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.940
So... She's popular?

17:09.940 --> 17:11.410
Vice principal:
Brittany Willa darrow.

17:11.410 --> 17:13.740
Phil, I'm sorry
I gave you grief earlier.

17:13.740 --> 17:15.839
Today has hit me much harder
than I thought it would.

17:15.849 --> 17:17.109
It's okay to be emotional.

17:17.109 --> 17:19.079
It's too late.
I'm all cried out.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.780
It's like there's no more
moisture left in my body.
Tiffany Dean.

17:21.780 --> 17:24.650
I'm afraid if I blink,
my eyes will get stuck.

17:24.650 --> 17:26.920
Hmm. Really?

17:26.920 --> 17:29.960
Do you remember that video
where the lion greets the man...

17:29.960 --> 17:32.760
And hugs him 'cause he
hasn't seen him in 20 years?

17:32.760 --> 17:36.430
Yep. I sure do.
I am... Dead inside.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.500
Vice principal:
Manuel Alberto delgado.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.340
Bravo, Manny! Baby!

17:41.340 --> 17:43.300
Mwah!
You did it, buddy!

17:43.310 --> 17:45.810
Vice principal:
Lucas Phillip Dunphy.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.270
Alex: Yeah!

17:47.280 --> 17:50.210
Haley: Whoo!
Claire:
My baby, my baby!

17:50.210 --> 17:52.050
Well done, son.

17:52.050 --> 17:53.650
Remember how cute he was

17:53.650 --> 17:55.650
in his little
buzz lightyear costume?

17:55.650 --> 17:58.050
Or how he used to say
"burfday" and "li-bary"?

17:58.050 --> 18:00.550
He still does.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.160
This is...
Tearing me up.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.730
Vice principal:
Margaret Ruth everts.
Congrats, buddy.

18:05.730 --> 18:08.800
Why does your gown smell
like Haley's perfume?

18:09.930 --> 18:13.000
Claire: This is a fun game,
isn't it? But you know what?

18:13.000 --> 18:17.140
Maybe one where
we just sat at a table...

18:17.140 --> 18:18.910
Hey.

18:18.910 --> 18:21.410
Hey.

18:21.410 --> 18:24.180
Congratulations on the first

18:24.180 --> 18:26.010
of what I'm sure
will be many diplomas.

18:26.020 --> 18:27.480
Unless you want to skip all that

18:27.480 --> 18:29.750
and move to Colombia
and become a radiologist.

18:30.820 --> 18:33.320
Thanks for helping me with
the cap-and-gown mess.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.890
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

18:34.890 --> 18:36.390
I'm just happy you and your dad

18:36.390 --> 18:38.360
got to have some
father-son time last night.

18:39.490 --> 18:41.700
Yeah.

18:41.700 --> 18:42.900
What?

18:44.330 --> 18:47.200
It's just with me graduating
and everything,

18:47.200 --> 18:49.240
I kind of wanted to say...

18:49.240 --> 18:51.540
You and me today, you know,

18:51.540 --> 18:54.380
that's what I think of
as father-son time.

18:55.810 --> 18:58.680
Let me tell you something.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.780
After my divorce,

19:00.780 --> 19:02.850
my rule for dating was no kids.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.920
And then you and your mom
came along,

19:05.920 --> 19:07.560
and all of that
went right out the window.

19:08.990 --> 19:11.230
What I'm trying to say is...

19:13.130 --> 19:15.760
here's to you, son.

19:15.770 --> 19:18.100
You know, I'm still
kind of hungover.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.770
You're a man now!
Power through!

19:20.770 --> 19:23.140
The thing is, we love the car.

19:23.140 --> 19:25.540
We were so moved by the gesture.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.310
So moved.

19:27.310 --> 19:29.140
Hey! I'm back!

19:29.150 --> 19:31.050
I guess I just needed
to rehydrate.

19:31.050 --> 19:32.310
Ohh.

19:32.310 --> 19:34.550
But we can't keep it.

19:34.550 --> 19:36.950
Honey, it's just...
It's too generous.

19:36.950 --> 19:38.590
But I love you guys so much.

19:38.590 --> 19:41.660
You're the graduate.
You need the car. It's yours.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.890
I don't know what to say.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.490
How 'bout "nailed it"?

19:47.500 --> 19:49.630
I wanted that sweet ride
from the moment I saw it,

19:49.630 --> 19:52.000
but I knew my parents
would never let me get it.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.940
I also knew they'd never keep it
if I gave it to them, so...

19:55.940 --> 19:57.600
If there were
any s.A.T. Questions

19:57.610 --> 20:00.940
about tricking your parents,
I'd be going to college.

20:00.940 --> 20:03.780
Come on, you guys.
Let's roll.

20:03.780 --> 20:04.950
You guys leaving already?

20:04.950 --> 20:06.110
Yeah, we all have plans.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.410
Cam: Wait. Lily?

20:07.420 --> 20:08.950
There are nine girls
who will freak

20:08.950 --> 20:10.750
if I don't make
an appearance at Jenna's.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.250
I'm confused.
I-is she fun?

20:13.260 --> 20:16.460
Hang on.

20:17.690 --> 20:19.660
Ooh, nice ride!

20:19.660 --> 20:21.030
Bye-bye!

20:21.030 --> 20:23.160
See ya later!
Claire: Bye!

20:23.170 --> 20:24.300
- Bye!
- Bye!

20:24.300 --> 20:25.870
Oh, my gosh!
Luke is driving!

20:25.870 --> 20:27.700
They didn't even stay
for dessert!

20:28.800 --> 20:30.140
Oh, god.
They're really gone.

20:30.140 --> 20:31.370
It's so sad.

20:31.370 --> 20:32.670
But isn't it what we hoped for?

20:32.680 --> 20:33.710
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.510
A toast.

20:35.510 --> 20:38.110
We raised them
to be independent,

20:38.110 --> 20:39.180
and now they're out in the world
having their own lives.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.210
We did it.

20:40.220 --> 20:41.520
Gloria: <i> Isalud!</i>
To us!

20:41.520 --> 20:42.980
Oh, sorry I missed
the first part,

20:42.990 --> 20:44.320
but I'll drink to whatever
you're toasting.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.890
Top me off!

20:50.560 --> 20:51.630
Uh... What are you doing?

20:51.630 --> 20:53.230
Well, I'm just trying to see

20:53.230 --> 20:55.900
if there's anything else
about Lily we haven't noticed.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.230
Like... she plays golf?

20:58.230 --> 21:00.130
No, we would know.
Aren't there Greens fees?

21:00.140 --> 21:01.700
And what about this?
Huh?

21:01.700 --> 21:03.000
"La dolce vita"?

21:03.010 --> 21:04.170
She likes Italian films?

21:04.170 --> 21:05.540
Well, no wonder she thought

21:05.540 --> 21:07.370
"ice age: Collision course"
was boring.

21:07.380 --> 21:08.410
I liked it.

21:08.410 --> 21:10.680
Okay. What else?

21:10.680 --> 21:13.250
A photo of Lily shaking
hands with the governor?!

21:13.250 --> 21:14.720
What? When?!

21:14.720 --> 21:16.550
Okay, maybe we need to
start paying more attention.

21:16.550 --> 21:18.890
Or if it ain't broke...

21:18.890 --> 21:21.220
Yeah, she's fine.
She's fine.
