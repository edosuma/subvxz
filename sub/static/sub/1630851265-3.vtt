And, you know, one of the things
that the writers and I

talked a lot about was,
how do they view

43:59.263 --> 44:00.786

44:00.830 --> 44:02.962

we really found interesting

44:03.006 --> 44:07.401
was that what if they looked
at empties as not just the dead,

44:07.445 --> 44:10.578

there are still living souls

44:10.622 --> 44:12.363

So, the act of killing them
wasn't always in self-defense.

of freeing the souls

of freeing the souls.

to feel like a threat,

44:40.086 --> 44:43.786

dynamic duo of the episode.

So rather than just seeing
Dev and Asha kill empties,

44:47.441 --> 44:50.401
part of that ritual was
scooping out the eyeballs

into the sockets.

but what we see this season
is that Elton is pushing back,

to believe that, you know --

is sort of wallowing in, like,

Elton is doing the opposite,

47:23.206 --> 47:24.860

in denial about

47:24.903 --> 47:26.252
how cruel this world can be.

of reward that he gets

for believing in Dev and Asha,
believing they're good people,

47:31.388 --> 47:35.348

he and Percy with Iris.

a bit of reward

47:37.916 --> 47:40.701

for believing in the world.

47:40.745 --> 47:42.138

47:42.181 --> 47:44.140
is that reward kind of
gets stripped away

47:44.183 --> 47:46.403
when what he learns
after this reunion

47:46.446 --> 47:49.058
is that the CRM is responsible

47:49.101 --> 47:50.842
for the destruction
of their home,

which means everyone that Elton
grew up with, they're all dead.

for Elton to deal with,

47:56.630 --> 47:59.807

Percy's view of the world.

this episode is about for Elton.

48:04.073 --> 48:06.031

to see the world?

48:06.075 --> 48:08.207
Is he in denial
to think it's good?

48:22.700 --> 48:25.964

things that are very different,

and they've lived through
different experiences.

48:27.705 --> 48:31.013

of time, so much has happened.

48:31.056 --> 48:33.841
