more newspaper reports

17:17.319 --> 17:21.530
which will necessarily mention
the burning of the King's likeness.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.329
I put you in Birmingham
for one very specific reason.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.401
Are you any nearer to finding
those stolen guns?

17:30.600 --> 17:32.762
- We are making steady progress.
- We need results.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.968
Goodnight, Mr Campbell.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.523
Does this report
name any of those involved?

17:41.520 --> 17:43.522
It names a Mr Thomas Shelby.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.162
The report mentions he's a war hero.

- ADA: In bed.

18:02.960 --> 18:06.123
Couldn't sleep. Then I couldn't wake up.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.286
Then I was cold, and then
I had to go for a wee.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.891
Then I was with this bear on a boat.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.601
That was just a dream.
Then I was hungry.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.646
Why are you reading the paper?

18:20.320 --> 18:21.401
Why wouldn't I be?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.289
Well, I've never seen you
read the paper.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.442
I've only ever seen you
light fires with them.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.001
One week.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.045
Five weeks.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.724
Seven, if you count weekends.
I think it's a lack of iron.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.966
I got some tablets.

I'm not getting rid of it, Aunt Pol.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.086
Yeah, but they all say
they'll come back.

Fine beast you got there, Thomas.

He runs most of the legal trackside
betting outside of London.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.450
He has policemen on his payroll.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.847
I want you to put in a word with
the Chief Inspector of Gloucestershire,

35:19.480 --> 35:21.562
that his men should leave me alone

35:21.800 --> 35:23.609

35:26.440 --> 35:28.283
Forgive me, I don't seem to have a pen

35:28.680 --> 35:31.650
to write down this rather
long list of demands.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.965
And what do I get in return?

35:39.120 --> 35:40.531
I have what you're looking for.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.085
I have the guns.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.561
What guns?

35:51.960 --> 35:53.883
- I'm not here to play games.
- Wait, wait...

36:06.000 --> 36:08.571
Twenty five Lewis machine guns.
Fifty carbines.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.962
Ten thousand rounds of ammunition.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.162
All in a crate bound for Libya.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.927
Stolen from the BSA
factory proofing bay.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.565
I'm guessing they sent you to Birmingham
to get those guns back.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.605
Well,

36:22.960 --> 36:24.166
it's me that has them.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.842
I have left word with men I trust,

36:28.920 --> 36:31.605
that if I am taken into police custody
for whatever reason,

36:32.040 --> 36:33.804
those guns will be shipped to Liverpool.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.687
From there, they will be sent
directly to Belfast.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.765
And sold to the Irish Republican Army.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.168
All your good work in Ireland
will be undone.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.008
Each stolen weapon
is numbered and marked.

36:46.600 --> 36:50.241
If I sell them to the IRA, it won't
be long before Mr Churchill finds out.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.526
I imagine you got into enough trouble

36:52.600 --> 36:54.409
over the burning
of the King's photographs.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.046
That was just a taster.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.689
If those guns reach Belfast,

37:01.080 --> 37:03.128
your life in the force is over.

what I have set out to achieve,

37:12.040 --> 37:13.883
You'll probably get a medal.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.641
I'm a fair man.

37:18.880 --> 37:19.961
It's a fair offer.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.686
Do we have a deal?

37:32.680 --> 37:33.920
I need an answer.

37:34.800 --> 37:35.961
Right now.

37:40.800 --> 37:41.961
Very well.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.204
But I'd prefer if we don't
shake hands on it.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.043
Now, why would I shake the hand of a man

38:03.920 --> 38:05.684
who didn't even fight for his country?

his own daughter into a whorehouse.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.441
But no matter how repugnant it may be,

39:36.920 --> 39:39.400

42:30.960 --> 42:32.803
You bought at the fair in bad feeling.

42:33.160 --> 42:36.687
The Lees put a bad seed in the hoof
and got an old woman to put a spell.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.802
So those Lee bastards cursed him.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.281
Was he lame?

44:57.680 --> 44:59.284
He looked at me the wrong way.

It's not a good idea
to look at Tommy Shelby the wrong way.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.524
- What a waste.
- Yeah.

You're the thickest.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.560
I'm told the boss is called Tommy,
and I'm guessing that's you,

54:45.720 --> 54:47.722
'cause you're looking me up and down
like I'm a fucking tart.

54:50.640 --> 54:52.130
I want to know what you want.

54:53.480 --> 54:55.721
There were suspicious betting patterns
at Kempton Park.

54:55.800 --> 54:57.165
A horse called Monaghan Boy...

54:58.640 --> 55:00.961
He won by a length twice
and then finished last.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.564
With £3,000 bet on him.

55:04.080 --> 55:05.445
Which one am I talking 1:0?

55:06.880 --> 55:09.770
- Which one of you is the boss?
- I'm Mr Kimber's adviser and accountant.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.963
And I'm the fucking boss, okay?
Right. End of parlay.

55:13.120 --> 55:15.361
You fixed the race
without my permission.

55:16.520 --> 55:19.126
You fucking gypsy scum!

55:19.320 --> 55:23.211
What, live off the war pensions and
these poor old Garrison Lane widows?

55:23.400 --> 55:28.088
That's your level. I am Billy Kimber!
I run the races

55:28.160 --> 55:31.767
and you fixed one of them. So I'm
gonna have you shot against the post.

55:33.560 --> 55:34.766
Mr Kimber.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.401
Look at it.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.480
That has my name in it.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.001
It's from the Lee family.

55:47.800 --> 55:50.531
You are also at war with the Lees,
Mr Kimber, am I right?

55:54.760 --> 55:57.240
The Lees are attacking your bookies
and taking your money.

55:57.480 --> 56:00.643
Your men can't control them.
You need help.

56:02.520 --> 56:04.921
Perhaps we should listen to what
Mr Shelby has to say,

56:06.240 --> 56:07.526
before we make our decisions.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.047
Right. The Lees

56:11.160 --> 56:12.810
are doing a lot of talking at the fairs.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.245
They have a lot of kin.

56:14.320 --> 56:16.322
They're saying the racetracks
are easy meat

56:16.560 --> 56:19.006
because the police are busy
with strikes. Now,

56:19.480 --> 56:21.960
we have connections.
We know how they operate.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.887
You have muscle.

56:25.600 --> 56:28.080
Together we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

56:30.640 --> 56:34.440
Mr Kimber, perhaps we should take
some time for reflection.

56:35.080 --> 56:37.845
Possibly make arrangements
for a second meeting.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.125
I admire you, Mr Kimber.

56:41.320 --> 56:45.006
You started with nothing
and built a legitimate business.

56:46.160 --> 56:50.085
It would be an honour
to work with you, Mr Kimber.

56:52.480 --> 56:56.371
Nobody works "with" me.
People work "for" me.

57:01.560 --> 57:02.686
Pick it up, pikey.

57:13.720 --> 57:15.290
Sit. Sit down.

57:23.880 --> 57:25.006
It's for your ceiling.

57:25.880 --> 57:27.041
Thank you, Mr Kimber.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.601
We will be at Cheltenham.

57:33.920 --> 57:35.001
As will I.

57:54.520 --> 57:55.567
(EXHALES)

57:56.360 --> 57:58.328
So you picked a fight with the Lee's
on purpose.

57:59.080 --> 58:02.801
Tommy, we can't mess with
Billy fucking Kimber.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.242
Get yourself a decent haircut, man.

58:05.640 --> 58:06.880
We're going to the races.

58:29.440 --> 58:35.209
