Yes, your awful handiwork.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.361
It extends beyond the ink

03:14.403 --> 03:16.530

03:18.657 --> 03:21.035

03:21.076 --> 03:24.455

I wanted to say to you.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.748
So many things.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.166

03:27.207 --> 03:29.877
I traveled all these blocks,
all these years.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.879
And now I'm here.

03:31.921 --> 03:36.008
And it's so hard for me to...

03:36.050 --> 03:38.844
I felt such sadness
when you left

03:38.886 --> 03:42.181
because of what you thought
that creature made you do.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.559
But just a letter
and a necklace?

03:45.601 --> 03:48.979
Why couldn't you share
your grief with me?

03:49.021 --> 03:51.357
I wanted to, but, uh...

03:51.398 --> 03:55.903
If we shared the weight...

03:55.945 --> 03:57.363
I don't know.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.866
It would somehow feel heavier.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.452
When Naomi was born,
our beautiful daughter,

04:03.494 --> 04:07.039
um, all this sadness
that I was feeling,

04:07.081 --> 04:09.291
it turned to anger.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.626
She was yours.

04:10.668 --> 04:13.003
How could you have left?

04:13.045 --> 04:15.923
I lived through the war, too,
Meyer.

04:15.965 --> 04:18.092
Why was I left
to raise her alone?

04:18.133 --> 04:21.178
Ruth, please. Please.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.933
When she died,
all of the light left my world.

04:25.975 --> 04:28.560
And soon I felt nothing.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.604
And why should I?

04:30.646 --> 04:33.440
What was there to feel?

04:33.482 --> 04:35.734
Oh, did you know that she died,
our daughter?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.569
Did you know?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.822
I did.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.574
Ah.

04:42.616 --> 04:46.662
And why didn't you come for me?

04:46.704 --> 04:48.372
Because you know
the things I've done.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.666
Yes, I know the things
that you've done for me.

04:50.708 --> 04:55.587
To save my life,
I know the things you've done.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.381
When our daughter died,

04:57.423 --> 05:00.509
a new light came into my life,

05:00.551 --> 05:02.761
her boy, Jonah.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.513
And I felt again.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.807
I felt that,
with this little boy,

05:06.849 --> 05:08.642
I felt everything
would be all right.

05:08.684 --> 05:12.021
This is your grandson
I'm talking about.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.815
And, unfortunately,
he looks like you.

05:14.857 --> 05:18.068
Not the hair or the eyes,
but he has the light.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.738
He has the light
that you once had.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.574
And I won't let them
extinguish it.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.785
Not the man in the market,
not anybody.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.912

just sit here, Ruth, quiet.

32:16.393 --> 32:18.354
Well, let's have a look.

32:18.395 --> 32:20.230

32:20.272 --> 32:22.274

- Yeah.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.491
This is quite expertly done.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.910
Yeah, it shouldn't scar.

45:05.495 --> 45:08.540

45:08.581 --> 45:11.459

the papers to escape,

45:46.077 --> 45:49.205

45:49.247 --> 45:52.208
And then, uh...

45:52.250 --> 45:54.461
I buried him there.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.480
And, what, what, what,
you just walked out of there?

45:56.504 --> 45:58.149
You just took his papers?
You took his name?

45:58.173 --> 45:59.966
You just walked
right out of there?

46:00.008 --> 46:01.968
I left your safta his necklace.

46:02.010 --> 46:05.054
Then wrote her a note,

46:05.096 --> 46:07.640
um, as Meyer

46:07.682 --> 46:10.643
that I couldn't
be with her anymore

46:10.685 --> 46:12.020
because she was there

46:12.061 --> 46:15.231
when I had killed the 11 men.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.400
And I c...

46:17.442 --> 46:19.152
No, no. You...

46:19.194 --> 46:21.196
- What?
- You have the tattoo.

46:21.237 --> 46:22.030
The-the...

46:22.071 --> 46:23.781
the scar.

46:26.075 --> 46:28.286
I did them myself.

46:28.328 --> 46:30.497
With, um, one of them...

46:30.538 --> 46:32.749
penknives and ink.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.251
You did that yourself?

46:36.544 --> 46:39.172
And I managed
to escape to Berlin.

46:39.214 --> 46:41.382
But, on the streets,

46:41.424 --> 46:44.302
a survivor recognized me.

46:44.344 --> 46:45.887
Started to scream.

46:45.929 --> 46:48.890
I, um, got away, but...

46:48.932 --> 46:50.725
I knew I...

46:50.767 --> 46:53.061
The name of Meyer
was not gonna be enough.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.562
I had to do something else.

46:54.604 --> 46:56.981
I had to become...

46:57.023 --> 46:59.817
him.

47:02.445 --> 47:05.823
I went to an SS surgeon,

47:05.865 --> 47:08.993
who happens to be...

47:09.035 --> 47:12.830
this man who sits dead
before us.

47:16.668 --> 47:20.296
I transferred to this man
my entire savings,

47:20.338 --> 47:23.967
and he gave me a mask,

47:24.008 --> 47:25.468
which...

47:25.510 --> 47:27.595
- is what you see today.
- And you...

47:27.637 --> 47:30.014
and, what, you just...

47:30.056 --> 47:33.101
You came to America
as Meyer Offerman.

47:33.142 --> 47:35.436
Everything that you told me.
You told me all this...

47:35.478 --> 47:37.081
Everything that you said...
Every-every story,

47:37.105 --> 47:39.691
- every-every blessing.
- All true, Jonah.

47:39.732 --> 47:41.210
No, no, but they're his.
They're his to tell.

47:41.234 --> 47:42.962
They're-they're his to give.
They're not yours.

47:42.986 --> 47:44.529
Well, I was...

47:44.571 --> 47:46.006
They're not yours.
They don't belong to you.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.615
I was there. I saw.

47:47.657 --> 47:49.885
It wasn't enough for you to f...
Get the fuck away from me!

47:49.909 --> 47:51.786
Wasn't enough for you
to torture him?

47:51.828 --> 47:52.846
To force him to kill,
then kill him.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.080
You take his heart, his soul,

47:54.122 --> 47:55.748
his fucking blood.
Me, my safta.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.750
You had to...

47:57.792 --> 47:59.711
Was this a fucking game for you?

47:59.752 --> 48:03.381
It wasn't a game, Jonah.
It was...

48:03.423 --> 48:06.801
30 years I lived as a Jew,

48:06.843 --> 48:09.762
I saw as a Jew,
I thought as a Jew.

48:11.889 --> 48:15.727
You know, I finally woke
from the coma of hatred,

48:15.768 --> 48:18.646
and I saw the evil I had done

48:18.688 --> 48:20.523
to your grandparents...

48:23.109 --> 48:26.112
and realized that I was
the villain of my own story.

48:27.155 --> 48:28.740
You don't recover from that.

48:28.781 --> 48:30.175
Want me to take fucking pity
on you?

48:30.199 --> 48:32.327
I don't give a shit
what the fuck you went through.

48:32.368 --> 48:33.453
You're a fucking Nazi.

48:33.494 --> 48:34.871
I'm not a Nazi.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.098
Of course you're a fucking Nazi.

48:36.122 --> 48:37.498
I was never a Nazi.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.167
No matter what.

48:39.208 --> 48:42.295
The Reich was nothing to me.

48:42.337 --> 48:44.547
You think I cared
for the ideology?

48:44.589 --> 48:46.507
Then why?
Why the fuck did you do it?

48:46.549 --> 48:48.593
No, I was a surgeon.

48:48.635 --> 48:50.887
And they gave me power.

48:50.928 --> 48:54.682
To run their laboratory.

48:54.724 --> 48:58.186
And with the power
they gave me...

48:58.227 --> 48:59.854
Power breeds evil,

48:59.896 --> 49:02.523
and the evil consumed me.

49:02.565 --> 49:05.276
You saw the evil that you did.
You saw it,

49:05.318 --> 49:07.695
and you kept going. You
kept playing that fucking part.

49:07.737 --> 49:09.906
- You loved it.
- I didn't love it.

49:09.947 --> 49:11.491
You loved all this shit,
didn't you?

49:11.532 --> 49:14.327
You can't know
what a hell it was to be Meyer.

49:14.369 --> 49:15.953
Hell? Hell?

49:15.995 --> 49:18.039
I had a mother.
I had a father.

49:18.081 --> 49:19.791
I was a person, too.

49:19.832 --> 49:22.919
I had to kill the person I was
and be Meyer.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.672
Hell... living like a fucking
king. It was hell for you.

49:25.713 --> 49:27.590
Yeah, building all this
on his fucking name,

49:27.632 --> 49:29.133
- on his grave.
- I didn't plan it,

49:29.175 --> 49:31.135
you know, all this.

49:31.177 --> 49:32.970
I came to America.

49:33.012 --> 49:35.556
The Jewish organization
got me here,

49:35.598 --> 49:37.892
got me a, uh...

49:37.934 --> 49:39.727
a job at a factory.

49:39.769 --> 49:41.830
A factory. You're a surgeon
working at a fucking factory.

49:41.854 --> 49:43.815
I couldn't be a surgeon, Jonah.

49:43.856 --> 49:46.025
I couldn't tell 'em
what I really was.

49:46.067 --> 49:48.861
That would contradict
all the lies I've told.

49:48.903 --> 49:52.365
I had to commit
to the whole Jewish faith.

49:52.407 --> 49:55.868
I studied Hebrew.
I went to... temple.

49:55.910 --> 49:59.038
Read the Torah.
I did it all, you know?

49:59.080 --> 50:00.456
I became a Jew.

50:00.498 --> 50:02.417
No, you're not a fucking Jew.

50:02.458 --> 50:04.001
No.

50:06.796 --> 50:09.465
A little over a year ago...

50:11.008 --> 50:13.302
there was a knock at my door.

50:15.513 --> 50:18.474
It was your safta.

50:18.516 --> 50:21.728
And she came into the room.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.814
She, of course,

50:24.856 --> 50:28.025
th-thought I was Meyer.

50:28.067 --> 50:31.863
She showed me the light.

50:31.904 --> 50:35.366
And she inspired The Hunt.

50:35.408 --> 50:37.618
And from that moment,

50:37.660 --> 50:40.121
she became my savior,

50:40.163 --> 50:43.791
because she gave me
the opportunity

50:43.833 --> 50:47.712
to finally do something
that was right,

50:47.754 --> 50:51.048
to-to finally grow

50:51.090 --> 50:54.051
a little bit closer
to the light.

50:54.093 --> 50:56.679
And, what, what, you thought it
your redemption or some shit?

50:56.721 --> 50:59.015
- What? No. No.
- Huh? You thought y-y...

50:59.056 --> 51:01.768
-No? No? Good.
-Please, Jonah.
No, I don't look for redemption!

51:01.809 --> 51:04.329
-You'll never get redemption.
You'll never get absolution.
-I don't want redemption!

51:04.353 --> 51:05.956
- You'll never get forgiveness.
- I don't seek it!

51:05.980 --> 51:08.149
I don't deserve it!

51:09.192 --> 51:11.152
The Hunt is my penance,

51:11.194 --> 51:15.072
because it gives me purpose,
finally.

51:15.114 --> 51:18.326
In The Hunt, I find myself.

51:18.367 --> 51:20.995
I'd kill for The Hunt.

51:21.037 --> 51:23.206
I will die for The Hunt.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.541
The Hunt isn't yours.

51:25.583 --> 51:27.418
It doesn't belong to you.

51:27.460 --> 51:29.045
Who does it belong to, then?

51:29.086 --> 51:30.880
It belongs to the 11 million

51:30.922 --> 51:32.562
who cry out from their graves
for justice,

51:32.590 --> 51:34.801
that's who.

51:34.842 --> 51:38.054
It belongs...

51:38.095 --> 51:39.472
to Ruth.

51:39.514 --> 51:41.224
It belongs to Meyer.
It belongs to me.

51:41.265 --> 51:42.892
- You? Hmm?
- Yeah.

51:42.934 --> 51:44.185
By what right?

51:44.227 --> 51:46.062
- Birthright.
- Birthright?

51:46.103 --> 51:47.480
Yeah. Birthright.

51:47.522 --> 51:48.898
You turned away from The Hunt

51:48.940 --> 51:50.316
the first time
you heard about it.

51:50.358 --> 51:52.068
You took the easy way out.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.070
Who was it that got you back?

51:54.111 --> 51:55.154
Me.

51:55.196 --> 51:57.865
How could you be trusted

51:57.907 --> 51:59.575
to do what is necessary?

51:59.617 --> 52:01.994
'Cause my grandfather did.
'Cause my safta did.

52:02.036 --> 52:04.413
And they're part of me.
They are me.

52:04.455 --> 52:07.166
Do you want to kill me?

52:07.208 --> 52:09.669
You want to become
the leader of The Hunt?

52:09.710 --> 52:12.922
You'll have to do
what is necessary,

52:12.964 --> 52:15.258
and you can't, can you?

52:15.299 --> 52:17.510
Because you need me.

52:17.552 --> 52:19.011
No, I don't fucking need you.

52:19.053 --> 52:21.722
- Yes, you do. You do.
- I don't fucking need you.

- Hmm?

52:23.766 --> 52:25.893
If I don't do this, who am I?

52:25.935 --> 52:27.895
Who?

I've learned that these people

Offerman's bandits

58:46.148 --> 58:48.108

59:02.122 --> 59:04.500

Well, you'll see for yourself

Joe's place was all
packed up. I thought

59:25.729 --> 59:29.400
he would've told me,
but I guess he, uh...

59:31.568 --> 59:33.570
found a way out.

59:34.738 --> 59:37.116
Mindy, too.

59:37.157 --> 59:40.703

59:40.744 --> 59:42.121

59:42.162 --> 59:44.540
she says her family
needs her now.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.583
I blame Ben.

59:48.585 --> 59:51.005
Does anyone else want to leave?

59:53.674 --> 59:55.634
Do you?

59:57.011 --> 59:58.679
Do you?

59:59.722 --> 1:00:01.807
If so, now's the time.

1:00:05.227 --> 1:00:07.813
They're still out there.

1:00:09.815 --> 1:00:11.191
I mean, what did we do...

1:00:11.233 --> 1:00:14.194
We stopped... one plot,

1:00:14.236 --> 1:00:15.821
one ploy?

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:19.992
They're gonna keep coming.

1:00:20.034 --> 1:00:21.785
They're everywhere.

1:00:21.827 --> 1:00:23.203
They're on the streets.

1:00:23.245 --> 1:00:24.663
They're-they're on TV.

1:00:24.705 --> 1:00:27.666
They're in boardrooms,
they're in politics.

1:00:27.708 --> 1:00:29.668
Seeping in.

1:00:29.710 --> 1:00:32.171
This is why
we have to do what we do.

1:00:32.212 --> 1:00:35.799
This is why
we have to do what is wrong.

1:00:38.844 --> 1:00:41.221
Because if not us,

1:00:41.263 --> 1:00:43.265
then who?

1:00:53.442 --> 1:00:55.402
This can't happen again.

1:00:55.444 --> 1:00:57.446
Never again.

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.618
Agent Morris...

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.620
She's gonna be on us,

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:07.247
on us every step of the way.

1:01:07.289 --> 1:01:09.541
She will hunt us

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:11.835
while we hunt them.

1:01:11.877 --> 1:01:15.255
Then perhaps we don't
hunt them in America.

1:01:15.297 --> 1:01:17.925
My contact sent a dossier.

1:01:19.176 --> 1:01:21.053
Die Spinne, they called it.

1:01:21.095 --> 1:01:23.639
A highly covert operation

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:26.850
in which eight of Hitler's
highest-ranked lieutenants...

1:01:26.892 --> 1:01:29.728
The leaders of the Nazi regime...
Were shuttled

1:01:29.770 --> 1:01:31.188
out of Nazi Germany

1:01:31.230 --> 1:01:34.858
and disappeared into Europe.

1:01:36.568 --> 1:01:39.113
So, you twats,

1:01:39.154 --> 1:01:41.657
perhaps it's time we

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:43.826
take our expertise
across the pond...

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:47.996
and kill

1:01:48.038 --> 1:01:51.291
these fucking shites
of the Round Table.

1:01:54.128 --> 1:01:56.797
Yeah, I could definitely
use a getaway.

1:02:01.135 --> 1:02:03.762
Let's find these fascist fucks.

1:02:08.308 --> 1:02:11.603
