WEBVTT

00:13.690 --> 00:15.590
Ugh! I lost again.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.370
This stupid thing was throwing me off.

00:18.630 --> 00:20.860
Dude! Pops' Mustaches Monthly!

00:20.860 --> 00:23.110
Benson told us to deliver this weeks ago.

00:23.180 --> 00:24.810
You have to give this to Pops.

00:24.810 --> 00:26.350
What?! Why do I have to?

00:26.350 --> 00:29.110
Because you're the tool who crammed it between the sofa cushions.

00:29.110 --> 00:30.050
I can't get up now.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.660
I'm going to lose this sweet butt cheek groove

00:31.660 --> 00:33.190
I've been working into this couch!

00:33.190 --> 00:34.860
It looks just like me!

00:34.860 --> 00:36.500
I'm not going up those stairs, dude.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.960
Fine, let's play rock-paper-scissors for it.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.310
Whatever.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.860
Pops. Yo, Pops.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.690
I found your Mustache Monthly.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.140
Get out!

01:06.120 --> 01:07.580
Stop playing for a second!

01:08.220 --> 01:11.030
When I went upstairs, Pops was getting out of the shower.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.090
Yeah, so?

01:12.090 --> 01:14.020
And he didn't have a towel.

01:14.990 --> 01:17.460
I tried not to look and just give him the magazine but I saw his...

01:17.460 --> 01:19.080
His junk mail?

01:20.220 --> 01:22.070
No, dude, I'm mentally scarred.

01:22.070 --> 01:24.820
It's like the image is glued in the inside of my eyelids.

01:24.820 --> 01:28.630
Every saggy, wrinkled, shriveled, pasty...

01:29.360 --> 01:30.570
Don't put it in my head!

01:30.570 --> 01:32.620
This is your fault! You have to help me.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.300
I'll help you to forget it if you promise to stop talking about it.

01:35.450 --> 01:36.170
Deal.

01:37.810 --> 01:40.980
What you need is some Strong Johns!

01:41.040 --> 01:42.040
Let's do it.

01:53.606 --> 01:56.176
If this doesn't take your mind off of Pops, nothing will.

01:56.236 --> 01:57.746
What, coffee?

01:57.776 --> 02:00.066
- Thanks, dude, but I don't see how... - No, dude.

02:00.266 --> 02:03.256
- Margaret. - So, that's two sandwiches and one soda.

02:05.506 --> 02:06.856
All right.

02:07.466 --> 02:09.606
- All right. It worked. - Hey, guys!

02:10.976 --> 02:12.866
Can I get you something to drink, Mordecai?

02:16.746 --> 02:19.206
Come on, let's get some movies. That'll get your mind off Pops!

02:25.106 --> 02:26.176
See anything you like?

02:26.186 --> 02:27.586
NO!

02:27.636 --> 02:29.846
I'll go see if they have Good Cop, Sad Cop.

02:32.216 --> 02:34.656
Hey, man, have any copies of Good Cop, Sad Cop?

02:35.416 --> 02:36.386
Hello?

02:36.386 --> 02:38.586
Sure, man. Let me check for you.

02:41.856 --> 02:43.386
So, no then?

02:43.386 --> 02:44.776
Oh, yeah. No.

02:44.866 --> 02:47.386
All right. Just these and whatever my friend's getting.

02:50.636 --> 02:52.016
I guess just these.

02:52.926 --> 02:53.906
What are you watching?

02:53.986 --> 02:56.396
缺缺缺Starlight Excellent.

02:56.416 --> 02:57.186
Is it good?

02:57.186 --> 03:01.646
I watch 缺缺缺Starlight Excellent all day everyday.

03:01.926 --> 03:04.066
All day, everyday...

03:11.626 --> 03:12.976
Aw, how do you watch that?

03:12.976 --> 03:15.466
It's like barfing rainbows in my eyes.

03:15.466 --> 03:19.746
I watch 缺缺缺Starlight Excellent all day everyday.

03:19.746 --> 03:21.106
You already said that.

03:21.106 --> 03:23.446
I watch it all day, every day.

03:23.516 --> 03:25.476
Dude, you already said that. Don't you remember?

03:25.476 --> 03:27.766
All day, every day.

03:28.126 --> 03:28.846
What?!

03:28.846 --> 03:31.076
I watch it all day, every day.

03:32.856 --> 03:34.116
Every day.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.216
I'm just gonna borrow this.

03:39.416 --> 03:41.876
Trust me, man. This will make you forget.

03:42.126 --> 03:45.386
No, no. I'm not looking at anything ever again.

03:45.386 --> 03:47.656
Every time I open my eyes, I see Pops naked.

03:47.656 --> 03:49.406
- Just give it a chance. - No!

03:49.586 --> 03:52.326
Look at it! Look at it!

03:52.326 --> 03:54.606
- Look at it! - No! I'm not looking at a stupid--

04:02.156 --> 04:03.056
Yes!

04:06.556 --> 04:08.446
Cool!

04:22.866 --> 04:23.736
Did it work?

04:24.146 --> 04:25.676
Mordecai! Mordecai!

04:25.676 --> 04:27.156
Do you remember seeing Pops naked?

04:27.636 --> 04:28.636
Pops naked?

04:28.706 --> 04:30.536
Pops naked? Nude? In the buff?

04:30.736 --> 04:32.536
Naked Pops, naked Pops, naked Pops!

04:33.486 --> 04:36.656
Awesome! Dude, it totally worked! Up high!

04:38.376 --> 04:39.836
Let's... get you some coffee.

04:40.796 --> 04:43.936
Margaret! The usual: two coffess, please.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.706
Better make that espresso.

04:45.706 --> 04:48.126
Hey Mordecai, you're back! Feeling better?

04:49.426 --> 04:50.386
Mordecai?

04:52.266 --> 04:54.436
Oh my gosh, is Mordecai ignoring you?

04:54.436 --> 04:57.466
Is it just me or does Mordecai look like he's been working out?

04:57.616 --> 05:00.496
Mordecai, snap out of it. We're finally gonna have some fun!

05:00.496 --> 05:03.716
Just two friends hangin' out, lettin' the good times roll!

05:03.716 --> 05:04.926
Like old times!

05:31.036 --> 05:33.366
Gimme back my friend!

05:33.676 --> 05:36.116
He's been like this ever since he watched the video.

05:36.116 --> 05:38.556
And now he doesn't remember any of the stuff we used to do!

05:38.576 --> 05:39.386
Video...

05:39.486 --> 05:42.516
It wasn't 缺缺缺Chasers Excellent, was it?

05:42.586 --> 05:44.136
Uh... Yeah, why?

05:44.136 --> 05:46.056
We have to watch the tape.

05:52.776 --> 05:53.746
We're in!

05:54.036 --> 05:55.036
Wait, where are we?

05:55.036 --> 05:56.556
We're in the tape, dude!

05:56.606 --> 05:59.406
Mordecai! Dude! We're here to rescue you!

05:59.496 --> 06:00.666
What's the point?

06:00.666 --> 06:04.376
Whether I'm in here or out there, I can't forget about seeing Pops naked.

06:04.376 --> 06:07.006
You're still thinking about that? Get over it already.

06:07.006 --> 06:08.296
You don't get it, dude!

06:08.296 --> 06:10.356
It's not something you can just un-see.

06:10.566 --> 06:12.566
We have to change your memory.

06:12.566 --> 06:13.276
What do you mean?

06:13.276 --> 06:15.956
If we find your memory of Pops and cover it,

06:15.956 --> 06:17.796
you won't remember seeing him naked.

06:17.796 --> 06:18.886
Where do we start?

06:19.086 --> 06:20.976
Your memories are over there.

06:23.606 --> 06:24.586
Weird.

06:28.616 --> 06:30.206
Why are we in the coffee shop?

06:30.346 --> 06:32.286
These are his memories.

06:37.616 --> 06:39.606
Oh, yeah, I remember that too.

06:39.606 --> 06:41.256
This isn't the memory we need.

06:41.296 --> 06:43.286
Yeah. We need to find Pops' room.

06:43.286 --> 06:44.716
let's go back to the house.

06:44.786 --> 06:45.736
There's the exit.

06:50.526 --> 06:52.986
All day, every day.

06:53.296 --> 06:55.396
Memory isn't logical.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.256
We'll have to keep looking 'til we find the-

06:57.376 --> 06:59.546
The house! We're getting closer.

07:17.566 --> 07:18.816
Pops' room!

07:23.466 --> 07:25.026
Oh, gross!

07:25.106 --> 07:27.056
Quick! Cover him with that blanket!

07:34.536 --> 07:36.026
What... the...?

07:38.146 --> 07:38.896
Get him!

07:45.026 --> 07:47.586
You idiots... if you don't clean this place up...

07:47.586 --> 07:52.076
you're fired! You're fired! You're fired!

07:52.156 --> 07:53.986
Hang on... you're fired!

08:10.246 --> 08:13.196
Pops isn't really like this. We're never gonna catch him!

08:13.196 --> 08:14.446
How come he's so fast?

08:14.446 --> 08:17.226
I don't know! I just remember everything happening really fast.

08:17.226 --> 08:19.936
Like, I put down the magazine and all of a sudden Pops was there.

08:19.936 --> 08:21.236
It was just like he uh--

08:25.006 --> 08:27.616
That's it! Just start remembering stuff, dude?

08:27.616 --> 08:28.236
What?

08:28.386 --> 08:31.456
You have to use your memories to catch Pops.

08:31.456 --> 08:32.476
Think of something!

08:34.446 --> 08:36.275
- Think harder. - I'm trying!

08:38.416 --> 08:39.046
Yes!

08:42.716 --> 08:44.275
He's still too fast!

08:44.275 --> 08:46.486
Remember something to block his path.

08:48.276 --> 08:49.176
I can't!

08:49.176 --> 08:51.376
Remember that time we ate all that cereal?

08:51.376 --> 08:53.196
Yeah, we must have eaten like a million boxes

08:53.196 --> 08:55.896
because you wanted that lame Strong Johns figurine.

09:01.246 --> 09:03.596
I remember when Margaret had that gigantic boyfriend!

09:16.216 --> 09:17.156
Nice!

09:17.966 --> 09:20.556
Margaret's boyfriends were always really lame.

09:22.276 --> 09:24.556
We have to cut off his path.

09:25.776 --> 09:28.276
I remember that crazy steep cliff at the end of the park!

09:30.806 --> 09:32.336
Now he's got nowhere to go.

09:34.176 --> 09:35.896
He's not slowing down!

09:40.176 --> 09:41.136
Now what?

09:44.276 --> 09:45.396
Dude, what are you doing?!

09:45.666 --> 09:47.406
Getting rid of that memory.

09:58.916 --> 10:00.366
I did it! I caught him!

10:05.046 --> 10:07.716
I remember the time we ripped a hole in that kid's bouncy castle!

10:16.746 --> 10:17.516
Did it work?

10:17.656 --> 10:19.086
Yeah, I think so.

10:19.126 --> 10:20.736
How do we get out of here, Skips?

10:22.116 --> 10:23.356
I think I can help.

10:24.106 --> 10:25.816
It's the guy from the video store!

10:25.816 --> 10:28.026
There's a tape sticking out of that wall over there.

10:28.026 --> 10:29.946
Grab onto it and you should be home free.

10:29.946 --> 10:31.136
Don't you wanna leave, too?

10:31.156 --> 10:33.956
Nah, I'm kinda into not having to work for the rest of my life.

10:37.656 --> 10:38.876
Here goes...

10:44.566 --> 10:47.066
It's gone! Naked Pops is gone!

10:47.066 --> 10:48.676
I don't remember it anymore!

10:48.676 --> 10:50.766
What did you guys do? What is this mess?

10:50.766 --> 10:54.756
I can't even take a shower around here without you guys screwing things up--
