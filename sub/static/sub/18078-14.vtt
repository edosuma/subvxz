WEBVTT

00:02.277 --> 00:03.945
<i>That's Katrina Karpov.</i>

00:04.029 --> 00:05.531
<i>The star of the Russian ballet.</i>

00:05.614 --> 00:07.825
Katrina? Where is she?

00:07.908 --> 00:09.118
Welcome to freedom.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.745
I hope all of you
will be all right.

00:11.787 --> 00:15.124
How is Ivan gonna
start World War III?

00:15.207 --> 00:17.334
By stealing Abraxas.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.922
It appears that the A-Team
has jumped sides...

00:22.005 --> 00:23.590
and gone to work
for the Russians.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.259
From here on out,
it's shoot to kill.

00:25.342 --> 00:27.719
You're not gonna get away
with this, you commie flake.

00:31.974 --> 00:34.309
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.434 --> 00:36.103
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.646
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.729 --> 00:38.939
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:39.064 --> 00:40.607
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.732 --> 00:42.359
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.484 --> 00:43.986
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:44.069 --> 00:45.946
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:46.029 --> 00:48.490
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.574 --> 00:49.992
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:50.033 --> 00:52.327
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:35.138 --> 02:36.306
Don't move!

02:36.473 --> 02:38.600
- We're here--
- I know what you're here for.

02:39.393 --> 02:43.105
Three cases of Uzis,
10,000 rounds of ammo...

02:43.397 --> 02:46.900
three grenade launchers
and two anti-tank weapons.

02:47.859 --> 02:49.903
I want to inspect
the weapons Mr. Ross.

02:49.987 --> 02:52.572
Yeah? I want to
inspect the cash.

02:58.370 --> 03:00.539
There should be
$100,000 in there.

03:17.514 --> 03:18.849
I want to try it.

04:09.775 --> 04:11.735
Get out of the way, pal.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.113
Hey.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.825
Is that the hottest broad
you've ever seen, or what?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.827
I'm appalled that
in the presence...

04:20.911 --> 04:22.788
of one of nature's
most perfect creations...

04:22.871 --> 04:26.416
that you can display the crass
behavior of a drunken salesman...

04:26.625 --> 04:29.836
at an aluminum siding
convention in Atlantic City.

04:30.045 --> 04:33.173
Listen, pal, all I said was
she's one red-hot bimbo.

04:33.256 --> 04:34.975
Just be quiet.
Shh!

05:05.497 --> 05:08.250
Sasha sends his regards.
He'll see you soon.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.844
So my critical friend, how did
you like the performance?

05:20.095 --> 05:23.306
Yes, I would like to ask a question
to one of your typical performers.

05:28.145 --> 05:32.441
Ask him, would he like to sell
aluminum siding in this country?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.280
Katrina?

05:40.115 --> 05:42.659
Katrina? Where is she?

05:46.288 --> 05:47.873
Katrina. I want her.

05:51.501 --> 05:53.320
Hey!

05:53.420 --> 05:56.756
Hey, pal, you can't treat a
member of 66 like this...

05:56.882 --> 05:59.009
just because you're
from out of town.

07:01.863 --> 07:03.448
<i>Nyet,</i> comrades!

07:23.677 --> 07:25.053
Welcome to freedom.

08:06.219 --> 08:10.181
Well, the pen is mightier than the
sword, but it's no match for a gun.

08:10.307 --> 08:11.808
Nice job, B.A.

08:11.975 --> 08:14.686
Now, let's get rid of this
wreck and get back to the van.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.707
You can take off your tutu, darling.
Welcome to America.

08:17.732 --> 08:19.149
Here's your dance bag.

08:24.362 --> 08:26.656
I'm sorry you had to
go through all this, Katrina.

08:26.781 --> 08:28.366
It was wonderful.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.119
Somehow I thought...

08:31.244 --> 08:33.496
a candlelight dinner might
be more to your liking.

08:33.705 --> 08:35.582
It was like James Bond, no?

08:35.707 --> 08:37.792
You know, Katrina,
I have to agree with you...

08:37.876 --> 08:39.544
from the standpoint
of entertainment...

08:39.669 --> 08:43.506
on the Murdock scale of one to
ten, I'd have to give it a nine.

08:43.631 --> 08:45.842
A nine? Let me see you
drive like that!

08:45.925 --> 08:48.386
But, I never give a ten. Never,
never, never, never, never.

08:48.553 --> 08:51.848
I mean, there's no such thing
as perfection in the arts, B.A.

08:51.973 --> 08:55.727
This is a ten on B.A.'s scale.
Ten being total pain.

08:55.852 --> 08:57.395
Come on, guys.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.440
You'll be in close quarters
here for four days.

09:00.565 --> 09:03.610
I have to wait to see
my brother for four days?

09:03.693 --> 09:05.987
Well, we have to make sure
Sasha isn't being followed.

09:06.071 --> 09:07.822
They know you have
a brother in this country.

09:07.906 --> 09:09.324
Let's settle in,
it's been a long day.

09:09.407 --> 09:11.826
Lieutenant, you take the first
watch in here with Katrina.

09:11.910 --> 09:14.788
Murdock, you and B.A. and I'll
split it up after that.

09:16.081 --> 09:17.707
Pleasant dreams, guys.

09:21.211 --> 09:23.380
Hannibal, don't you think
it is a bit of a mistake...

09:23.463 --> 09:24.923
to let Face stay in
there with Katrina?

09:25.006 --> 09:27.842
I mean, isn't that like giving
the henhouse keys to the fox?

09:28.927 --> 09:29.928
Captain,

09:30.929 --> 09:33.723
we must all deal
with our own weaknesses.

09:33.848 --> 09:36.518
Yes, the old tragic flaw.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.853
The cornerstone
of Greek drama from...

09:39.187 --> 09:42.816
Euripides to the latter
episodes of Mister Ed.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.118
Two points.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.584
I am bored.

10:02.252 --> 10:04.087
Well, I...

10:05.255 --> 10:08.633
I have heard so much
about American men.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.761
I'm dying to try one on.

10:11.886 --> 10:15.640
I think you mean, try one out.

10:15.765 --> 10:16.975
Whatever.

10:17.976 --> 10:21.855
How you say,
"Take off all your clothing"?

10:21.980 --> 10:25.108
Actually, you got that
just right.

10:25.233 --> 10:30.363
You know, your English
isn't that bad.

10:30.488 --> 10:33.533
Your shoulders are not that bad.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.411
I think I take a bath...

10:36.619 --> 10:40.457
and slip into
nothing more comfortable.

10:41.082 --> 10:43.543
You mean something more...

10:43.710 --> 10:46.171
But I get the idea.

10:49.799 --> 10:53.136
When I return
you wear nothing, no?

10:53.303 --> 10:55.388
Nothing, yes.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.974
Yeah. Yes.

11:00.518 --> 11:01.811
Yes!

12:01.913 --> 12:03.164
Sorry, pal.

12:08.837 --> 12:12.340
No, I don't believe it.

12:12.674 --> 12:16.553
Dimitri Shastovich,
right here in our living room.

12:17.178 --> 12:20.431
What? They've got you baby-sitting
ballerinas now, Dimitri?

12:20.598 --> 12:24.894
What can I say, it's been very
slow for me since Vietnam.

12:25.228 --> 12:28.314
But I must say, you three
are looking very well.

12:28.439 --> 12:30.066
How long has it been?

12:30.191 --> 12:32.735
Don't get him started, Hannibal.
He can outtalk Murdock.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.988
Hannibal, it's just coffee.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.073
You set us up, Dimitri.
What's going on?

12:37.156 --> 12:38.741
You mean you knew all along?

12:38.825 --> 12:40.159
Had a pretty good idea.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.370
Your little phone call
confirmed it.

12:42.579 --> 12:43.788
Dimitri?

12:44.372 --> 12:45.957
I'm afraid it's going
to be a long story.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.042
I knew it. That's why
he brought the coffee.

12:48.126 --> 12:49.460
Don't get him started, Hannibal.

12:49.586 --> 12:51.546
You'd better condense it
to 25 words or less...

12:51.713 --> 12:54.299
otherwise, B.A.'s gonna wanna
shut your mouth permanently...

12:54.382 --> 12:55.884
and I'm not sure I can stop him.

12:55.967 --> 12:57.135
All right.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.097
I have reason to believe
that one of my countrymen...

13:01.306 --> 13:05.184
within 36 hours will commit
act of terrorism...

13:05.268 --> 13:09.230
which will bring our two
countries on to brink of war.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.857
Nuclear war.

13:12.358 --> 13:15.403
I have been sent
by my government...

13:15.987 --> 13:17.447
to stop this from happening.

13:17.572 --> 13:19.699
So, on behalf of people...

13:19.824 --> 13:23.828
of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics...

13:25.663 --> 13:27.582
we would like to hire A-Team.

13:35.298 --> 13:40.428
Soviet colonel, whose plan to attack
West was vetoed by Kremlin...

13:40.887 --> 13:42.513
decided to go ahead with plan...

13:42.680 --> 13:44.891
went underground
in Los Angeles...

13:45.350 --> 13:47.644
to create terrorism...

13:47.852 --> 13:50.188
and possibly trigger
World War III.

13:50.271 --> 13:51.648
Why don't your people grab him?

13:51.731 --> 13:54.275
A full-scale Soviet
operation would be stopped.

13:54.359 --> 13:59.322
They would be picked up. I am under deep
cover and I have very little time.

14:00.281 --> 14:02.075
There's something you're
not telling us, Dimitri.

14:02.158 --> 14:03.910
It shows in your eyes.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.964
Ivan Padavich.

14:18.257 --> 14:20.551
Ivan the Terrible.

14:22.053 --> 14:25.181
That's is another reason
that I come to you.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.851
You know him.
You know how he thinks.

14:29.018 --> 14:30.687
You fought
against him in Vietnam.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.730
You remember what he did to
that village in the Delta.

14:32.814 --> 14:34.565
He's not a soldier,
he's a butcher.

14:34.691 --> 14:37.235
If he's in this country,
we've gotta get him.

14:37.318 --> 14:38.945
Hannibal, I don't wanna
work for this sucker.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.155
But I hate Padavich even more.

14:41.698 --> 14:44.492
You know, Colonel, this
jumped off the Art page.

14:44.575 --> 14:46.411
It's a banner headline,
four columns.

14:46.577 --> 14:48.454
You said it.
And the key question?

14:48.538 --> 14:51.624
How is Ivan gonna
start World War III?

14:51.708 --> 14:53.543
By stealing Abraxas.

14:53.626 --> 14:58.423
A super satellite which can
destroy 80% of Russian missiles.

14:58.589 --> 15:01.009
Why the heck can't you just
contact the boys in Washington?

15:01.092 --> 15:04.429
They would not even
acknowledge its existence.

15:04.762 --> 15:07.140
We do not know where it is.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.101
We don't even know
what it looks like.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.896
But sources tell us that it
will be moved within two days.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.899
This weapon is so secret...

15:17.191 --> 15:22.030
your government chooses to
relocate it every two months.

15:22.071 --> 15:22.839
Clever.

15:22.864 --> 15:25.408
Padavich must have
gotten to someone...

15:25.491 --> 15:28.036
who not only knew
where it was...

15:28.703 --> 15:30.663
but how to make it operational.

15:30.788 --> 15:33.499
But he must move in 36 hours.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.211
We'll want files on Ivan and
all of his known associates.

15:37.336 --> 15:40.923
I cannot help you.
I am not even in the country.

15:41.466 --> 15:45.261
But if you need some help
you go to Soviet Embassy.

15:46.971 --> 15:50.016
- Then we are on the same side.
- For now.

15:52.769 --> 15:55.063
Here is floor plan of Embassy.

15:55.146 --> 15:57.398
You've certainly come prepared.

15:57.482 --> 15:59.150
I anticipate.

15:59.442 --> 16:01.486
All right,
here is main entrance.

16:01.611 --> 16:04.572
Here is Consulate General
Zamyatin's office.

16:04.739 --> 16:06.574
Here is file room.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.622
This is Padavich in Russian.

16:13.539 --> 16:16.542
- What's this small room here?
- It's infirmary.

16:17.168 --> 16:19.670
- How are you feeling, Murdock?
- I'm fine, why--

16:46.906 --> 16:49.242
Downwind! Downwind!

17:02.672 --> 17:04.257
Freeze! Don't move!

17:04.382 --> 17:06.467
What are you
looking for, a unicide?

17:07.093 --> 17:09.512
I'm a victim of gravity.

17:10.555 --> 17:12.390
Shut off those bells!

17:27.989 --> 17:30.032
Halt! Where are you going?

17:30.158 --> 17:32.368
That's our glider, that's our pilot.
What is this?

17:32.451 --> 17:35.806
I think this is
the Russian Consulate, Coach.

17:35.831 --> 17:38.583
Gee. Murdock really went off
course, when he broke that strut.

17:38.666 --> 17:39.765
He could be hurt.

17:40.022 --> 17:42.837
Comrade, you don't mind
if I call you comrade, do you?

17:42.920 --> 17:45.047
Good. Listen, you see
with the crosswind...

17:45.131 --> 17:47.550
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

17:47.633 --> 17:51.929
- Get your hands off that equipment.
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

17:54.473 --> 17:57.059
Coach. Coach.

17:57.435 --> 18:01.147
Einstein was right,
the strut broke.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.149
Schrodinger, Heisenberg...

18:03.232 --> 18:05.026
they didn't know what
they were talking about.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.069
That's why I
was out of the zone.

18:07.653 --> 18:08.988
I can't believe it.

18:09.071 --> 18:13.034
The final round of Point Dume
National Gliding Championships.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.995
And we're stuck
with a broken strut.

18:17.121 --> 18:19.957
You see, infinity is
like an envelope...

18:20.041 --> 18:22.126
you can stretch it
across your eyes...

18:22.251 --> 18:24.128
put a light behind it,
but you can never...

18:24.212 --> 18:26.214
see the light because
it won't travel fast enough.

18:26.297 --> 18:29.383
Yes, he's delirious. He needs medical
attention, Let's get him out of here.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.385
Nyet. He cannot leave.

18:31.552 --> 18:33.930
This is Soviet property.
He will be detained.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.932
Oh, give me a break.

18:36.390 --> 18:39.810
I mean, look at him.
Does he look like a spy?

18:40.102 --> 18:42.480
Why, he's the living
personification...

18:42.605 --> 18:45.524
of the flying all-American boy.

18:46.222 --> 18:47.001
Yes.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.779
He will be detained
along with his equipment.

18:50.279 --> 18:52.406
- Come with me.
- Get hold of our lawyer.

18:52.490 --> 18:55.201
- Have him contact the State Department.
- Right, Coach.

18:55.284 --> 18:56.702
Kepler was right...

18:56.827 --> 19:00.831
semi-permeable gases are
much stronger downwind.

19:00.915 --> 19:02.041
You see?

19:07.296 --> 19:11.717
All the talk about gas, we're
forgetting about the unified theory.

19:12.176 --> 19:15.179
We have the strong force
and a weak force...

19:15.304 --> 19:17.890
and there's gravity and
there's electromagnetism.

19:18.099 --> 19:19.850
We can't forget about that.

20:07.565 --> 20:09.159
An X-ray machine? That's good.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.986
Be sure you get all the bone
in the back of his neck.

20:14.989 --> 20:16.198
It's for the glider.

20:16.282 --> 20:20.119
This is an outrage. The State
Department will hear about this.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.163
I have sent for a doctor.

20:22.496 --> 20:24.457
And you will remain here,

20:25.249 --> 20:29.003
until we are satisfied
that this is all an accident.

20:29.086 --> 20:30.671
Let me tell you something, pal.

20:30.713 --> 20:33.924
President Reagan is a big
supporter of hang gliding.

20:34.008 --> 20:36.635
You could be starting an
international incident here.

20:36.761 --> 20:39.180
I will take my chances.

20:39.430 --> 20:40.973
You come with me.

20:43.934 --> 20:46.812
I want a report of this
as soon as possible.

20:59.784 --> 21:01.786
This has got to be...

21:02.828 --> 21:05.414
the most aerodynamic airplane...

21:10.753 --> 21:12.254
Okay, boys.

21:58.676 --> 21:59.844
Halt!

22:00.678 --> 22:01.720
Halt?

22:01.887 --> 22:03.848
But my body is
aerodynamically perfect...

22:03.889 --> 22:06.308
and this is the only
launchpad in 30 miles.

22:10.646 --> 22:14.316
Strip-search them again. If
they are clean, cut them free.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.776
How are you, son?

22:16.360 --> 22:18.571
Now you see,
he's got brain damage.

22:19.905 --> 22:23.409
Oh, get out, you two,
I never want to see you again!

22:24.076 --> 22:25.953
Get out of here!

22:29.165 --> 22:31.375
<i>Was investigation fruitful?</i>

22:31.458 --> 22:34.128
Yeah, we got this on Padavich,
but we can't read it.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.675
Contact this man named Bertka.

22:39.800 --> 22:43.679
His credentials for being
a radical is quiet extensive.

22:45.306 --> 22:46.557
Try this on him.

22:46.724 --> 22:48.392
It's a variation of
sodium pentothal.

22:48.475 --> 22:49.768
It's not only truth serum...

22:49.852 --> 22:53.731
but, if induced, can also
cause temporary amnesia.

22:54.064 --> 22:56.192
- Peppermint, my favorite flavor.
- Be careful.

22:56.483 --> 22:59.695
If you use too much,
act like laughing gas.

23:00.237 --> 23:03.073
Shasti, are you ready to go now?

23:03.240 --> 23:04.241
Shasti?

23:04.266 --> 23:05.392
What's going on?

23:06.285 --> 23:10.456
I am afraid she must
turn herself in to Consulate.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.790
Short defection, huh?

23:11.916 --> 23:13.876
No, Face, that's not the way
it happened at all.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.961
She was kidnapped by the CIA.

23:16.086 --> 23:18.881
She was tortured, escaped and then ended
on the front steps of the Consulate.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.674
What will
they do to her, Dimitri?

23:20.799 --> 23:23.385
Well, since she is
star of ballet troupe...

23:23.552 --> 23:26.597
I do not feel she will suffer
any consequences.

23:26.722 --> 23:27.973
Can you guarantee that?

23:28.057 --> 23:29.350
Yes, I can.

23:29.516 --> 23:34.146
Listen, I'm sorry
about last night.

23:35.064 --> 23:36.607
So am I.

23:38.234 --> 23:41.862
Well, I
hope you'll be all right.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.114
Face, the clock's ticking.

23:48.744 --> 23:51.664
I hope all of you
will be all right.

23:58.254 --> 24:00.839
Once we've penetrated
the perimeter...

24:01.048 --> 24:03.634
we'll proceed to
the centermost building here.

24:04.009 --> 24:08.472
There we'll place a single explosive
charge at the centre of the steel door.

24:08.555 --> 24:10.891
The fuse will
be set for six seconds.

24:11.100 --> 24:15.980
Once the door is blown, we'll take
our positions here, here, and here.

24:17.273 --> 24:19.358
Situated in these positions...

24:20.317 --> 24:23.237
we should be able to
hold the entire area secure.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.281
Very good. White team.

24:28.450 --> 24:31.245
White team will proceed...

24:31.328 --> 24:33.789
into the structure
and liberate this corridor.

24:33.831 --> 24:36.250
<i>Nyet. Nyet.</i>

24:40.379 --> 24:42.840
The only way we succeed...

24:43.048 --> 24:47.845
is if we all carry out the plan precisely.
There can be no mistakes.

24:47.928 --> 24:50.806
All personnel will be
taken here and neutralized.

24:52.057 --> 24:54.727
At which point, my team...

24:55.227 --> 24:56.687
Red team...

24:57.062 --> 24:59.606
moves into
the central chamber...

25:00.024 --> 25:02.234
and gains control of Abraxas.

25:02.901 --> 25:04.194
Now...

25:04.945 --> 25:10.200
I want you to go over every detail
of phase two in your minds.

25:10.659 --> 25:14.371
We are less than 24 hours
away from attacking.

25:15.372 --> 25:16.665
Bertka.

25:19.418 --> 25:24.006
Remember, tomorrow
you're meeting Panchow.

25:25.299 --> 25:26.884
He is the key.

25:27.051 --> 25:30.596
With him, we can bring
this country to its knees.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.390
- You can trust me, Mikhail.
- I know.

25:43.734 --> 25:46.153
- Bull Fulbright.
- I'm Lean. SIA.

25:46.236 --> 25:47.905
In charge of
special operations...

25:47.988 --> 25:50.074
in covert anti-radical
procedures, West Coast.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.576
Well, what brings the company
down here to my store?

25:52.826 --> 25:54.745
In the past 24 hours...

25:54.870 --> 25:56.663
there's been a defection
of a Russian ballerina...

25:56.747 --> 25:58.874
that ended in a KGB shoot-out...

25:58.957 --> 26:03.295
and a dramatic rise in intelligence
reports on the movements of radicals.

26:03.587 --> 26:05.923
Sounds to me like you had
a very busy morning.

26:06.090 --> 26:10.427
I'm just dying to know how I fit
into your commie mumbo jumbo.

26:12.846 --> 26:14.723
Routine surveillance photos...

26:15.224 --> 26:17.434
taken in front of
the Russian Consulate.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.103
Smith and Peck.

26:19.395 --> 26:21.480
I thought that might
pique your interest.

26:21.605 --> 26:25.317
It appears the A-Team has jumped sides
and gone to work for the Russians.

26:25.442 --> 26:27.903
Traitors, huh? I love it.

26:29.363 --> 26:33.534
There's somethings, Lean,
that never change.

26:34.576 --> 26:38.038
All right, from here on out,
it's shoot to kill.

26:39.915 --> 26:41.250
Thank you.

26:53.595 --> 26:55.347
Hey, what's going on?
Who are you guys?

26:55.479 --> 26:56.244
Gas company.

26:56.269 --> 26:57.891
We just found a leak
underneath this building...

26:57.975 --> 27:01.228
and three dead bodies, so get
out of here, all of you.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.566
Leak? I don't smell anything.

27:05.774 --> 27:06.984
You don't smell--

27:08.110 --> 27:10.571
Listen, I tell you,
I wish I had a nickel...

27:10.654 --> 27:13.824
for every poor slob
who never smelled anything.

27:13.907 --> 27:15.868
Gas is like a ghost.

27:16.034 --> 27:20.414
Floating through the air,
eating up oxygen and bam!

27:20.747 --> 27:23.876
And there you are, lying on the
floor with your eyes bulging...

27:24.001 --> 27:26.003
purple lips.
- Really?

27:26.128 --> 27:27.296
Can you tell me
where the meter is?

27:27.379 --> 27:29.631
Nine times out often times
that's the culprit.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.341
Sure, it's out here.

27:43.645 --> 27:46.273
We're looking for
Mikhail Padavich.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.108
Can you tell us where he is?

27:48.442 --> 27:50.944
You guys look like mosquitoes.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.906
He's wigging out on us. You gave
him too much of that stuff.

27:54.072 --> 27:55.949
I expected more
from a fellow journalist.

27:56.033 --> 27:57.117
What? Have you forgotten
the five W's?

27:57.242 --> 27:58.494
What, where, when, where...

27:58.535 --> 28:00.913
- Where is Padavich?
- Why?

28:10.088 --> 28:13.467
Pull around the back. Bertka
will unlock the door. Go now!

28:16.762 --> 28:19.723
That's Ivan, let's go.

28:21.266 --> 28:24.478
I have to be at the Malibu
Ranch Market by 5:00.

28:24.645 --> 28:27.231
- What?
- A dozen oranges.

28:27.397 --> 28:30.442
Move to the next stand,
three tomatoes.

28:30.484 --> 28:32.520
- No more, no less.
- Sounds like a code.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.196
Then a bouquet of flowers...

28:34.238 --> 28:37.241
And that's how you find
the big cheese.

29:12.859 --> 29:14.570
Bertka was babbling
some kind of code...

29:14.695 --> 29:16.071
before Padavich burst in on us.

29:16.196 --> 29:21.535
He said something about later this
afternoon at the Malibu Ranch Market.

29:21.660 --> 29:24.496
Yeah, then a shopping list.
Oranges, tomatoes, flowers.

29:24.580 --> 29:28.750
You remember that Cong captain that
we captured in the Nui Kto mountains?

29:28.834 --> 29:30.085
Oh, yeah.

29:30.252 --> 29:32.462
Ivan was an advisor
in his company.

29:32.546 --> 29:34.923
Precisely. Remember
when we interrogated Ivan...

29:35.007 --> 29:38.927
he told us how he made contact with
people that he met for the first time?

29:39.052 --> 29:41.096
Always in a public place...

29:41.263 --> 29:44.016
and usually
in the village market.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.935
And they had a little charade worked
out where the contact would go...

29:47.019 --> 29:50.981
from booth to booth and he'd buy
particular items in a certain order.

29:51.189 --> 29:54.359
That way Ivan could identify the contact
and see if he was being followed.

29:54.443 --> 29:57.112
We got to get to this guy
before Padavich does.

30:08.999 --> 30:12.878
I was sent to meet you.
Shall we?

30:33.315 --> 30:36.234
Okay, you talk...

30:36.860 --> 30:39.905
and you'll live,
it's as simple as that, pal.

30:41.782 --> 30:43.367
Who are you, anyway?

30:49.581 --> 30:51.625
I am deaf, I cannot hear.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.545
Come on, we gotta tell Murdock.

31:23.365 --> 31:25.701
You know, you're
very easy to spot...

31:27.369 --> 31:30.455
and you're quite unaware
of the fact that...

31:30.789 --> 31:32.624
you too are being watched.

31:32.791 --> 31:36.962
Mr. Panchow?
Please, please, not the name.

31:38.046 --> 31:39.423
Not the name.

31:41.550 --> 31:43.427
I hope that your...

31:44.052 --> 31:47.889
associates are capable
of executing their duties...

31:48.473 --> 31:49.850
better than you.

31:51.017 --> 31:53.687
Follow me,
but not to close to my heels.

32:07.033 --> 32:08.577
You must be deaf.

32:22.883 --> 32:26.553
I don't believe it.
Dimitri Shastovich.

32:26.803 --> 32:28.430
We didn't even think
he was in the country.

32:28.597 --> 32:29.931
Who's the skinny broad?

32:33.477 --> 32:36.062
Unless I've missed my guess,
that's Katrina Karpov...

32:36.229 --> 32:38.899
the star of the Russian ballet
who defected yesterday.

32:40.817 --> 32:42.986
They must have
made her change her mind.

33:02.130 --> 33:06.218
You know, Shastovich goes back
a long ways with your A-Team.

33:06.968 --> 33:09.721
Shastovich. Shastovich.
Shastovich.

33:10.347 --> 33:13.099
Isn't that the name of the guy they
captured during the bank robbery in Hanoi?

33:13.266 --> 33:16.061
Yeah, they tried to bring
him back as a prisoner.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.648
- But he never got there.
- That's the guy.

33:21.024 --> 33:24.361
At their trial, Smith claimed they were
on a ridge just north of the DMZ...

33:24.528 --> 33:28.365
when Shastovich bolted and jumped
about 10 feet onto some rocks.

33:28.532 --> 33:30.116
Broke both legs.

33:30.492 --> 33:31.576
With the enemy on their trail...

33:31.660 --> 33:33.370
there was no way
to carry him out.

33:34.996 --> 33:38.041
Or maybe they just let him go.

33:47.008 --> 33:48.468
That's close enough, B.A.

34:10.574 --> 34:14.119
Welcome Mr. Panchow. Are you
through with your parlor games?

34:14.452 --> 34:15.996
We have a lot of work to do.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.746
You just take
care of the laser...

34:17.914 --> 34:19.541
we'll handle the rest.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.835
He lost his hearing
several years ago...

34:21.918 --> 34:23.920
but he can read lips
quite well, now.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.433
Let's go.

35:20.477 --> 35:22.771
Looks like Russian,
spelled phonetically.

35:33.698 --> 35:35.951
Dimitri, I need a translation.

35:36.910 --> 35:39.579
It's phonetic. Sounds like...

35:40.246 --> 35:41.539
<i>Yucca Yar...</i>

35:41.790 --> 35:43.875
<i>Sierra Doroga...</i>

35:44.626 --> 35:47.379
<i>pyatt mele posle Acton.</i>

35:47.545 --> 35:52.592
It's Yucca Canyon, Sierra
Highway, five miles past Acton.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.260
Got you.

35:54.928 --> 35:56.096
Let's go.

36:18.451 --> 36:20.745
In an hour Abraxas will be ours.

36:20.996 --> 36:24.416
Then this world will be
a different place. Let's go.

36:34.175 --> 36:36.011
Stick to this ridge
and stay above them.

36:43.393 --> 36:44.436
Freeze!

36:45.603 --> 36:47.439
Or I'll drop you
where you stand.

36:50.066 --> 36:51.985
You're not gonna
believe this, General.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.871
This time, Smith,
I truly got you.

37:02.954 --> 37:06.207
A half a dozen men being led
by a Russian military expert.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.543
They're trying steal
something called Abraxas.

37:08.668 --> 37:09.919
Abraxas?

37:11.129 --> 37:13.757
- What do you know about Abraxas?
- That it's a laser.

37:14.007 --> 37:16.926
But it won't be ours very
long, if we don't move fast.

37:17.052 --> 37:18.970
Forget it, Smith.
We got your man, Shastovich.

37:19.095 --> 37:20.513
We know you're
working for the Russians.

37:20.638 --> 37:23.641
We're not working for the Russians.
We are working with them.

37:23.725 --> 37:25.143
That's a subtle distinction.

37:25.226 --> 37:27.812
Not really. Shastovich
came to us for help...

37:27.937 --> 37:30.398
to stop a Russian colonel
who's gone over the edge...

37:30.523 --> 37:31.858
and wants to start
World War III.

37:31.941 --> 37:34.277
- That's ridiculous.
- Maybe not.

37:35.028 --> 37:39.157
Abraxas is the code name for a killer
satellite that's located not far from here.

37:39.282 --> 37:42.202
When the system is in place, it's
capable of destroying 80%...

37:42.285 --> 37:44.788
of Russia's missiles while
they're still in outer space.

37:44.871 --> 37:48.750
And we have a man, who has
infiltrated the radicals.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.961
So, what's it gonna be,
gentlemen?

37:52.420 --> 37:55.715
- Okay, Smith, it's your show.
- No way, Lean.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.426
I'll leave two men here,
to take care of these people.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.303
We're gonna go in and get
those clowns ourselves.

38:00.428 --> 38:03.056
- We'll go as a unit.
- Under one condition.

38:03.181 --> 38:06.476
When this is over, you drop your
weapons and you surrender to me.

38:11.981 --> 38:13.149
Agreed.

39:13.793 --> 39:15.044
I'll take the right.

39:15.211 --> 39:18.206
- Count to two and then you take the left.
- You got it.

39:18.298 --> 39:19.507
Let's go.

39:35.023 --> 39:36.316
Get in, come on.

39:47.285 --> 39:48.286
Who are you?

39:48.453 --> 39:51.539
A man with many friends
and they're all outside.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.173
Take your men and join Bertka,
hold them off.

40:09.599 --> 40:12.185
You're gonna have to
carry this out of here.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.072
Careful.

40:44.592 --> 40:47.553
Put it there. You are going to
drive this through the wall.

40:47.637 --> 40:49.514
Man, I'm in
the risk pool already.

40:49.597 --> 40:50.682
They're gonna cancel my policy.

40:50.765 --> 40:52.433
Shut up. Do as I say.

42:45.380 --> 42:47.840
- Are you all right, Colonel?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

42:51.427 --> 42:52.512
How about you?

42:53.054 --> 42:57.392
Well, I won't be doing
my jeté for this week.

42:58.476 --> 42:59.977
I twisted my knee, I think.

43:00.978 --> 43:02.105
Here.

43:03.523 --> 43:05.775
Tie that creep to a tree
and then take off.

43:14.158 --> 43:15.827
We'd give ourselves up,
General...

43:15.952 --> 43:18.204
but remember what
Ulysses Grant once said...

43:18.329 --> 43:21.624
"There are no promises in war,
just strategies."

43:23.084 --> 43:26.379
- I thought you'd feel that way, Colonel.
-  I'm glad you understand.

43:26.546 --> 43:28.422
You know what
General Fulbright says?

43:31.217 --> 43:33.803
"The opera ain't over
till the fat lady sings."

43:44.897 --> 43:46.399
It's ironic, huh, guys?

43:46.566 --> 43:49.527
Every time we try to serve our
country, we end up behind bars.

43:49.652 --> 43:51.237
Yeah, thanks to Dimitri.

43:51.404 --> 43:54.782
I don't think he sold us out, B.A.
He's not the type.

43:56.325 --> 43:59.871
So how does it feel to heave the
A-Team's duffel bag under your bunk?

44:00.371 --> 44:01.706
Piece of cake.

44:02.039 --> 44:05.376
I don't understand Decker's problem
trying to run these clowns down.

44:22.476 --> 44:24.353
Drop your weapons!

44:37.450 --> 44:39.660
You're not gonna get away
with this, you commie flake.

44:39.827 --> 44:41.495
Do not intend to.

44:41.662 --> 44:45.583
15 minutes. My men and I
will surrender our weapons.

44:46.459 --> 44:50.087
But if you try to stop the A-Team
from escaping before then...

44:50.880 --> 44:52.256
I will kill you.

44:52.757 --> 44:54.342
That is promise.

44:54.842 --> 44:56.552
Nice working with you, General.

45:04.477 --> 45:06.312
Now what's
gonna happen to you, Dimitri?

45:07.438 --> 45:09.440
Diplomatic immunity.

45:09.857 --> 45:12.735
They put me on plane,
send me back to Soviet Union.

45:13.027 --> 45:16.906
I'll retire in dacha
outside of Moscow...

45:17.240 --> 45:18.407
and write my memoirs.

45:18.532 --> 45:20.910
Too bad nobody's ever gonna
get to read them.

45:21.077 --> 45:22.954
Might be the story
of the century.

45:23.955 --> 45:27.667
Why don't you do it for me, my friend?
You are a journalist.

45:29.377 --> 45:30.670
And...

45:31.462 --> 45:34.090
thank you, Colonel.
- Sure pal.

45:34.340 --> 45:37.218
Here, have a cigar.

45:38.305 --> 45:44.782
