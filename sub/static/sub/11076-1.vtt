This is Suzanne. How can I help you?

03:18.560 --> 03:21.400
Synedyne technical support.
This is Rachel. How can I help you?

03:21.480 --> 03:23.880
This is Elliot.
How can I help <i>you?</i>

03:23.960 --> 03:25.840
Oh.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.440
Oh, wow.
Yeah, okay.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.160
Give me a second to find you here.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.160
My computer's running
a little slow today.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.560
Wake up, fella.
Oh, there you are.

03:34.600 --> 03:39.200
Hey, you got yourself a model 5732,
128 megs of RAM, 27 gig hard drive.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.640
Good. Good. And you say that it hangs
every time you try and print?

03:42.720 --> 03:45.040
<i>Wow. All right,</i>
<i>no problem.</i>

03:45.120 --> 03:47.640
Can you hold for two seconds?

03:47.720 --> 03:50.840
<i>Carol! Carol.</i>

03:50.920 --> 03:53.320
I don't know what you've
been told, little lady,

03:53.320 --> 03:54.840
but the rest of us start at 9:00.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.360
I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.
Good morning.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.920
Hey, Dan, my man!
What's up, my bro?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.600
Put it there.
All right. Yeah.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.120
So, hoops today? You and the guys
up for some hoopage after work?

04:08.200 --> 04:10.360
Uh, you know,
we don't know yet, Elliot.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.520
I'm not sure yet, okay?

04:11.600 --> 04:14.160
Oh, that's cool, man.
Just let me know, 'cause I'm there, bud.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.680
'Cause I love the round ball.
That's why they call me "Air Elliot."

04:18.760 --> 04:21.000
Okay.

04:21.079 --> 04:24.520
Well, you know, make sure
that you let me know the right time,

04:24.600 --> 04:25.840
'cause last week you said 6:30,

04:25.840 --> 04:27.760
and when I got there you
guys were just leaving.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.560
- How stupid did you feel?
- Pretty stupid, Elliot.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.960
Not a problem, Danny.
Give it up.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.560
- <i>Hey, Daniel.</i>
- Hey, man, how you doing?

04:40.840 --> 04:42.920
Hey, Bob.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.840
- What's up?
- Hey, Elliot.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.720
So, uh, you and your posse
gonna hit the brewery tonight?

04:47.800 --> 04:50.160
My posse? No.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.120
Uh, they're all busy
with the big, uh...

04:53.200 --> 04:54.680
What's wrong with your neck?

04:54.680 --> 04:57.200
Uh, nothing.
It's repetitive stress disorder.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.560
It's a headset injury.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.520
What do you say you and me go knock
back suds and check out the babes?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.440
Elliot, I'm married, remember?

05:05.520 --> 05:08.440
I'm gonna go home and spend
some time with my wife.

05:08.440 --> 05:08.840
Ohhh.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.920
Taking a trip to Whipville.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.080
Oooh.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.040
That just gets funnier
every time you do that.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.280
- Don't-Don't-Don't...
<i>- Hey, Jerry!</i>

05:22.320 --> 05:25.480
#Jerry, Jerry, bo-berry
fee, fie, fo-ferry, Jerry ##

05:25.520 --> 05:26.640
What's happening, brother?

05:26.640 --> 05:28.360
Uh, running to an
important meeting.

05:28.440 --> 05:28.880
Oh, yeah?

05:28.880 --> 05:30.600
I think you're
gonna appreciate this

05:30.600 --> 05:32.440
'cause we're both
stereo component nuts.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.160
Check these out, homes.
These are the new Ingebritzens.

05:35.160 --> 05:35.560
Right.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.320
XVC speakers. Here, look it.
That's the back of the left speaker.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.160
And here's the front
of the right speaker.

05:41.160 --> 05:41.760
Sweet, sweet.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.960
That's the front of the left...
No, that's the right speaker.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.160
- I think... Oh, man!
- <i>What?</i>

05:53.200 --> 05:57.880
It's Elliot.
Who told him we were here?

05:57.880 --> 05:58.480
Oh!

06:03.560 --> 06:05.440
Hi.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.840
You guys.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.000
Well, well, well,
isn't this a big surprise?

06:13.080 --> 06:15.040
I thought everybody was busy.

06:15.120 --> 06:19.080
- Uh, slight change of plans, Elliot.
- Oh, is that right?

06:19.160 --> 06:21.040
Well, I'm a little bit
peeved at you guys.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.680
<i>I'm thinking you
tried to ditch me.</i>

06:22.680 --> 06:24.840
<i>I'm thinking I might</i>
<i>not even sit down with you.</i>

06:24.920 --> 06:26.320
We can understand that.
See you tomorrow.

06:26.320 --> 06:26.840
Later, Elliot.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.360
I'm kidding.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.120
- Wanna switch places with me?
- No, I'm fine.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.080
Oh, my goodness gracious.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.440
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

06:44.520 --> 06:46.840
<i>Please, please don't tell me you have</i>

06:46.840 --> 06:48.440
<i>a thing for Alison Gardner. Please.</i>

06:48.520 --> 06:50.360
<i>You're way out of your league.</i>

06:50.440 --> 06:51.480
<i> Plant life is out of his...</i>

06:51.480 --> 06:52.920
<i>Isn't she dating</i>
<i>that guy, uh, uh, in research?</i>

06:53.000 --> 06:56.760
Brian, with the teeth...
Brad, Brian... the guy with the teeth.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.000
No, that's been over
for three months now.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.600
- Oh, yeah? How do you know?
- I know a lot of things about her.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.880
I know... I know that she likes
her bagels buttered, but not toasted.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.720
- Wow.
- How specific.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.520
I know that she looks
beautiful in any color,

07:10.600 --> 07:13.280
<i>but when she wears blue...</i>

07:13.360 --> 07:16.840
- <i> Mm-mm-mm.</i>
- Sounds like you guys are old friends.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.000
Well, we have been working
at the same company for four years now.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.760
You spend that much time together,
you get to know each other.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.520
So it should be really no
problem for you to just get up,

07:25.520 --> 07:26.840
walk over and say hello to her.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.280
She's with somebody.
I'll catch up with her tomorrow.

07:29.280 --> 07:29.760
Yeah. Oh!

07:29.800 --> 07:32.760
Come on, Elliot.
Come clean here.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.880
You have never spoken
to Alison Gardner, right?

07:35.880 --> 07:37.080
Of course I have.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.480
- Did I say "queer" earlier?
- Oh, you are pathetic, Elliot.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.480
Really, you're pathetic.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.160
Okay. I guess you guys are just
not gonna let me relax

07:44.160 --> 07:45.800
until I go over there and say hello.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.320
Wow. That'll make you happy?

07:48.360 --> 07:50.600
You think I'm pathetic?

07:52.120 --> 07:54.760
- Don't touch me.
- <i> Go for it, tiger.</i>

07:54.800 --> 07:56.680
<i>Good luck.</i>

08:01.640 --> 08:03.880
I'm gonna go.
See you later.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.920
- Hi.
- Hi. Do I know you?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.840
Oh, I should hope so.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.640
Uh, we've only been working together
at Synedyne for the last four years.

08:13.720 --> 08:17.800
<i>I'm Elliot Richards.</i>
<i>We-We've spoken.</i>

08:17.840 --> 08:20.280
I'm sorry. I-I don't...

08:20.360 --> 08:23.240
It was the first week
of June three years ago.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.800
I said it was "wet out."

08:25.880 --> 08:29.000
We were standing in the lobby
and I said it was "really wet out."

08:29.080 --> 08:32.799
- It was raining at the time.
- I assumed that.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.240
Yeah.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.919
So, here we are talking again.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.880
Yeah.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.280
Uh, well, take it easy.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.480
You know, I'm here
with some friends

08:54.480 --> 08:56.880
and I was wondering if
maybe you wanted to...

09:10.560 --> 09:14.560
Dear God, I would give anything
to have that girl in my life.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.400
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:58.440 --> 10:02.120
Uh, I was wondering
if, uh, this is...

10:02.200 --> 10:06.080
Uh, I was standing
over there and the...

10:06.160 --> 10:09.120
You're very glib.
I bet you're a whiz with the ladies.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.280
- Well...
- You here alone?

10:12.360 --> 10:15.360
No, uh, I'm here with
some buddies from work...

10:15.400 --> 10:19.120
- I saw you talking to a woman.
- Um...

10:19.200 --> 10:22.280
Yeah, yeah.
But... I'm not with her.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.800
But you'd like to be, huh?

10:24.880 --> 10:27.840
- What makes you say that?
- Oh, I don't know.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.720
When a man says he'd
give <i>anything</i>

10:29.720 --> 10:31.200
to have a certain
woman in his life,

10:31.240 --> 10:33.240
I just assume
she means something to him.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.480
How did you hear me say that?
I was standing all the way over...

10:36.600 --> 10:40.240
I have fantastic hearing, and a number
of other equally impressive talents.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.360
Ho-doggie!

10:49.440 --> 10:52.880
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.000
Um, okay. You... What?
You wanna talk to me?

10:59.040 --> 11:02.680
Is that a problem?
You're not attracted to me?

11:02.720 --> 11:05.480
Uh, no.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.720
I think you're hot.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.200
Baby, you have no idea.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.480
- Kiss me.
- What? Here?

11:19.520 --> 11:22.360
Don't be afraid
to explore new horizons.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.360
Um...

11:31.840 --> 11:33.840
Can you give us
two seconds, girls?

11:33.880 --> 11:36.400
Yeah, can you give us
two seconds?

11:36.440 --> 11:38.720
Sure. Whatever.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.120
Listen. Whoo!

11:45.200 --> 11:47.120
You seem really nice...

11:47.160 --> 11:50.280
in a strong,
scary kind of a way.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.240
But my friends are, uh,
probably waiting for me,

11:53.320 --> 11:56.320
so, I'm... I'm gonna
just get going.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.680
You're so nervous, Elliot.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.600
How do you know my name?

12:00.680 --> 12:03.760
I'm psychic.
Plus, it's on your name tag.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.840
Duh.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.840
<i>Now, then, I just wanna</i>
<i>talk business for a second.</i>

12:09.920 --> 12:13.920
Oh, um, I'm not into that.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.600
I mean, l... I've never
paid for sex before.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.200
<i>Except this one time.</i>
<i>It was an Internet thing.</i>

12:19.280 --> 12:22.040
You can't help it. Every time
you sign on, it's sex, sex, sex.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.720
I'm not a hooker, you silly boy.
I just wanna ask you a question.

12:24.760 --> 12:28.040
<i>How would you like to make</i>
<i>one simple decision...</i>

12:28.120 --> 12:30.480
that'll change
your life forever?

12:32.040 --> 12:34.480
Okay, I'm glad Scientology
works for you, but...

12:34.560 --> 12:36.440
Just listen.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.400
What if I told you that
I had the cataclysmic power...

12:39.480 --> 12:43.160
to give you anything and everything
you've always dreamed of?

12:44.240 --> 12:47.720
- Who are you?
- Promise not to tell anyone?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.600
Okay.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.560
Cross your heart
and hope to die?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.680
Yeah.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.320
I'm the Devil.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.680
Okay.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.920
I think somebody's had
"tee many martoonis."

13:07.960 --> 13:12.120
I am the Devil, Satan, Lucifer,
Beelzebub, the Prince of Darkness.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.520
Well, the Princess
of Darkness, anyway.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.680
Here's my card.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.280
Oh.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.280
"The Devil." Yep.
That explains it.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.040
<i>Now I believe you.</i>

13:26.120 --> 13:27.920
Night-night.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.400
You're a very skeptical
person, you know that?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.880
How did you...
How did you just... And you...

13:36.960 --> 13:38.880
- What's...
- Look.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.360
If you could just buy into
this whole "I'm the Devil" thing,

13:41.440 --> 13:43.640
it'll save us both
a lot of these questions.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.160
Maybe I should call you a cab.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.320
Although it's gonna be hard to find one
that'll go to Hell this time of night.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.920
Ooh, what a delightfully
piquant wit.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.080
I can see we're gonna
get along famously.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.360
Cheers, darling.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.000
What are...
You can't... Look at...

14:01.080 --> 14:03.920
Geez!

14:04.000 --> 14:06.960
You can't do that.
That's very dangerous.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.880
Listen here. Why is this
so hard for you to believe?

14:09.920 --> 14:11.680
Do you think your mommy and daddy

14:11.680 --> 14:13.720
just made me up so
you'd be a good boy?

14:13.760 --> 14:16.240
Okay, okay, you're the Devil.
What do you want with me?

14:16.280 --> 14:19.480
I want you to be happy, Elliot.
You have such potential.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.000
All you need is a little push
in the right direction.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.840
- I am happy.
- Oh, please.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.560
You don't have to lie to me.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.520
I know every dark thought
in your tiny little mind.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.600
I know that every night you go home
to your horrible little apartment...

14:32.680 --> 14:34.280
and you eat your
little frozen dinner

14:34.280 --> 14:36.040
and you make your
little bowl of popcorn...

14:36.120 --> 14:39.920
and you watch TV and you can't keep
your eyes open anymore.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.240
And then you crawl
off to bed...

14:42.320 --> 14:45.480
and wonder why you're alone
and nobody likes you.

14:47.240 --> 14:51.120
- Not every night.
- And you cry.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.640
Yeah, sure.

14:57.080 --> 15:01.360
I know what's in your heart, Elliot.
You could cry right now.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.960
I'm talking about reinvention.
Taking control of your destiny.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.640
You wanna be liked?
You wanna be loved?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.600
How about respected?

15:15.640 --> 15:18.000
How about feared?

15:20.760 --> 15:23.280
What exactly
are we talking about?

15:23.360 --> 15:27.120
You wanna see how it works, baby?
Wish for something.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.040
- Like what?
- Whatever you want.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.600
It's yours.
Just say the word.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.040
Okay, I...

15:34.080 --> 15:36.640
wish I had a Big Mac
and a large Coke.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.680
It is done.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.880
Hi, how are you doing?
What can I get you?

15:46.960 --> 15:50.040
- A Big Mac and a large Coke.
- fries?

15:50.080 --> 15:54.000
- No.
- Comes to $3.47.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.800
Do you have $3.47?

15:57.880 --> 16:00.120
I left my purse
in the underworld.

16:00.200 --> 16:05.360
Oh, yes! This truly
is the work of the Devil.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.440
And to think that I doubted you.
I'm gonna go now.

16:08.520 --> 16:12.720
- What's the problem?
- This doesn't prove anything!

16:12.760 --> 16:15.760
I could have done this myself.
I even had to pay for it.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.760
There's no such
thing as a free lunch.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.360
Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

16:19.440 --> 16:22.560
- I didn't even get any fries!
- Oh, I don't believe this.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.080
I'm offering you the
opportunity of a lifetime

16:25.080 --> 16:27.400
and all you can do is
moan about french fries?

16:27.480 --> 16:29.680
- Good night.
- fine. Okay.

16:29.720 --> 16:33.000
I'm obviously not getting through
to you, so let's just forget it.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.320
Come. I'll give you
a lift back to your car.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.640
That's your car?

17:16.760 --> 17:18.560
Hey, hey!

17:20.520 --> 17:22.720
There's Elliot!

17:25.680 --> 17:28.840
Elliot, right here.
Right here, Elliot.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.800
Where are we?

17:33.880 --> 17:36.400
Just a little
after-hours club I own.

17:36.480 --> 17:39.520
We better get in there.
Everyone's waiting for you.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.320
- Everyone who?
- All your friends.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.120
How are you doing,
Mr. Richards?

18:06.240 --> 18:08.320
Hey, hey, Elliot.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.040
- No way. This is your club?
- Sure is.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.000
Wow!

18:14.040 --> 18:16.240
Elliot!

18:18.720 --> 18:20.600
Hello, Elliot.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.640
- Hello.
- Elliot, dance with me first.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.000
- No, Elliot, dance with me.
- He's dancing with me first.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.160
You can dance with me.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.760
That's enough. Break
it up. He belongs to me.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.120
Hey, Elliot, how the hell are you?

18:30.120 --> 18:31.680
Somebody take a picture
of me and Elliot.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.160
- Hold it.
- Excellent.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.920
- Hi, Elliot.
- Ooh.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.000
I think she likes you too.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.760
- <i>You hungry?</i>
- Sort of.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.080
Look.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.280
Wow. These look just like the
cookies my grandma used to bake.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.240
- Try one.
- Okay.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.840
These are the cookies
my grandma used to bake!

18:53.840 --> 18:55.360
I aim to please, handsome.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.000
- Come on.
- How did you...

18:59.280 --> 19:01.920
- You liked that, didn't you?
- What, the cookie?

19:01.960 --> 19:05.560
Having all those people
excited to see you.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.640
It's nice to feel
accepted, isn't it?

19:07.720 --> 19:09.600
I can give you that.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.480
I can make the
whole world love you.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.680
- Come on.
- <i>You still don't believe me.</i>

19:14.720 --> 19:17.280
- Do you?
- Of course not.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.720
first of all,
you look nothing like the Devil.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.000
Oh, really? I suppose
I could have gone this way.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.320
But it's so "trick or treat."

19:29.400 --> 19:32.960
It's true.
You really are the Devil.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.320
Oh. Come on, baby.
Come and sit down.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.680
I know this has all been
horribly overwhelming for you.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.440
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure you can.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.800
You can ask me anything you like,

19:43.800 --> 19:45.560
as long as you don't
ask me if there's a God.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.360
I get that one all the time.
It drives me absolutely bonkers.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.600
<i>Yes, there's a God.</i>

19:52.640 --> 19:55.200
Really?
Well, what's He like?

19:55.280 --> 19:58.560
You know, you'd think that meeting
the Devil would be interesting enough,

19:58.640 --> 20:01.080
but no, all people
want to know about is Him.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.000
Like He's so bloody fascinating.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.040
- So, He's a man?
- Yeah. Most men think they're God.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.960
This one just happens
to be right.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.880
<i>Now listen, darling.</i>

20:09.920 --> 20:11.440
I don't wanna pressure you,

20:11.440 --> 20:14.600
but why don't we take a teensy
little look at the contract?

20:20.960 --> 20:24.840
This is pretty... Um...

20:24.920 --> 20:29.160
"I, Elliot Richards,
hereafter known as the Damned..."

20:29.240 --> 20:32.120
- "The Damned"?
- How about "the Darned"? Sound better?

20:32.160 --> 20:34.440
Don't get hung up on
the language, darling.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.920
There's nothing sinister here.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.440
It's all standard boilerplate.

20:38.520 --> 20:43.640
Paragraph one states that I, the Devil,
a not-for-profit cooperation...

20:43.680 --> 20:45.520
with offices in Purgatory,
Hell and Los Angeles,

20:45.520 --> 20:46.560
will give you seven wishes...

20:46.600 --> 20:48.960
to use as you see fit.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.200
Seven?
Why not eight?

20:51.280 --> 20:54.760
Why not six? I don't know.
Seven just sounds right.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.880
Paragraph two outlines
the manner in which you'll pay

20:56.880 --> 20:57.960
for the aforementioned wishes.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.920
What? Are you kidding?

20:59.920 --> 21:01.280
I have to give you my soul?

21:01.360 --> 21:04.240
After you've had
your wishes, of course.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.600
But it's my soul!

21:05.640 --> 21:09.200
- I can't give you my soul!
- What are you, James Brown?

21:09.280 --> 21:11.800
What's the big deal?
Have you ever seen your soul?

21:11.880 --> 21:13.760
<i>Do you even know what it is?</i>

21:13.760 --> 21:15.840
Of course.
It's the thing that... that...

21:17.040 --> 21:19.000
No, that's the...
It floats around...

21:19.080 --> 21:21.280
Can I tell you something?

21:21.360 --> 21:23.760
Souls are overrated.

21:23.840 --> 21:27.440
They don't really do anything.
Has yours done anything for you so far?

21:27.520 --> 21:31.400
No. It's like your appendix.
You'll never even miss it.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.560
Yeah, well, if it's so useless,
then how come you want it so much?

21:34.640 --> 21:36.960
Ooh, aren't you the clever one?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.640
Look, who's really making out
on this deal here?

21:40.720 --> 21:45.320
Seven utterly fabulous wishes
for one piddling little soul?

21:45.400 --> 21:47.240
Well, I don't know.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.480
What have we here?

21:54.360 --> 21:57.280
But who is that? Alison?

21:58.720 --> 22:00.680
How did you...

22:00.760 --> 22:03.280
She is so beautiful.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.840
- I've been waiting for you for so long.
- Who's that?

22:07.880 --> 22:10.920
- Who's she with?
- I want you now, my love.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.600
- Why are you showing me this?
- I'm yours forever, my darling.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.600
Oh, I love your hair like that.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.480
You must go through
conditioner like crazy.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.680
- Is this real?
- It could be.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.960
All you have
to do is sign.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.320
And you promise I'll get her?

22:27.320 --> 22:29.880
It's really up to you.
You're the one with the wishes.

22:29.960 --> 22:34.080
But I promise
I'll do everything in my power.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.000
Sign it, Elliot.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.960
Please, Elliot. I'm waiting.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.440
- Great!

23:14.520 --> 23:17.640
Now, before you start wishing,
you'll be needing this.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.600
If for any reason your wish
isn't going the way you hoped,

23:20.640 --> 23:23.640
just take out the pager,
hit 666...

23:23.680 --> 23:25.920
and it'll bring you
right back to me.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.600
Why wouldn't it go
the way that I'd hoped?

23:29.640 --> 23:32.160
Oh, I was just throwing
that out as a "for instance."

23:32.240 --> 23:35.520
Every wish is gonna be
100% fabulous.

23:35.600 --> 23:39.160
But you'll find that out
as soon as you make one.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.400
So, I should make one now?

23:41.440 --> 23:44.880
Well, if you don't mind.
I've got places to go,

23:44.960 --> 23:48.160
people to condemn
to an eternity of fiery torment.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.360
Okay. Um, let me think.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.560
- I wanna be married to Alison.
- You got it.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.040
Um, that's not all.
I wanna be rich.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.960
- Always a popular choice.
- That's not all.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.960
I wanna be very rich
and very powerful.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.520
Oh, even better.
Remember, you have to say "I wish."

24:07.600 --> 24:09.480
Right.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.520
I wish that I were married
to Alison...

24:12.600 --> 24:15.160
and that I were very, very rich
and very powerful.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.840
- How's that sound?
- Sounds good to me.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.400
Enjoy.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.400
<i>## </i>

25:55.760 --> 25:57.400
Que diablos!

27:22.240 --> 27:24.440
- <i>Bueno.</i>
- Roberto.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.200
<i>Si.</i>

28:29.200 --> 28:33.560
<i>Corazon. Corazon!</i>

28:49.760 --> 28:53.480
I am is to visiting
in the Los <i>Angeles...</i>

28:53.520 --> 28:56.960
for the time of vacations.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.440
<i>Idiota!</i>

29:43.720 --> 29:46.120
<i>Jefe.</i>

30:43.400 --> 30:45.440
<i>Corazon.</i>

32:10.760 --> 32:12.840
<i>Es cocaina!</i>

33:37.480 --> 33:39.680
<i>Alejandro?</i>

33:39.720 --> 33:43.480
<i>Alejandro? Roberto? Esteban?</i>

35:02.760 --> 35:05.200
<i>Seis, seis, seis.</i>

35:10.680 --> 35:13.960
Back so soon?

35:20.040 --> 35:23.960
You turned me into a drug dealer.
They almost killed me.

35:24.040 --> 35:27.080
- You asked for rich and powerful.
- Not like that.

35:27.160 --> 35:31.520
Goes with the territory, babe.
Root of all evil. Ring any bells?

35:31.560 --> 35:35.680
- What about Alison? What got into her?
- I think it was Raoul.

35:35.720 --> 35:38.160
Yeah! That's not
what I wished for.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.640
Well, hold on now, mister.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.000
You wished that the
two of you were married.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.800
You didn't say anything
about her loving you.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.560
Well, you know, when two people
get married, I assume that...

35:47.640 --> 35:51.480
There's your mistake.
May I suggest something?

35:51.560 --> 35:51.800
What?

35:51.800 --> 35:54.720
The rich and powerful thing
wasn't really the way to go.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.920
Everyone wishes for that first thing
out of the gate and it never pans out.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.000
- Really?
- The fact of the matter is...

36:00.040 --> 36:03.360
women aren't really attracted
to wealth and power.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.760
- They're not?
- No, of course not.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.200
They couldn't give a fig
for all that rubbish.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.240
What you need to figure out
is what she does want in a man.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.160
How do I find that out?

36:13.240 --> 36:14.560
Easy.

36:14.560 --> 36:15.240
Easy.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.560
I'm not with her!

36:28.840 --> 36:29.640
<i>Where are we?</i>

36:29.640 --> 36:32.120
<i>A place you never would</i>
<i>have seen without my help.</i>

36:32.160 --> 36:34.160
<i>Welcome to Alison's bedroom.</i>

36:34.720 --> 36:38.120
We can't be in here. This
is breaking and entering.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.040
I know.
It's fun, isn't it?

36:40.120 --> 36:43.680
I'm sure we're gonna find the
answer somewhere around here.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.600
- What if Alison catches us?
- <i>Don't worry.</i>

36:46.680 --> 36:48.520
She won't be able to see you.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.560
- Besides, she's in the shower... naked.
- 

36:52.600 --> 36:56.080
<i>Right behind that door.</i>
<i>Go on. Go ahead. Take a peep.</i>

36:56.160 --> 36:59.480
- No!
- Oh, come on. We both know you want to.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.720
You must think that
I'm really perverted, don't you?

37:01.760 --> 37:02.800
That's what you think.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.480
You think I'm some sad,
desperate, twisted, pathetic loser.

37:05.560 --> 37:05.800
Yes.

37:05.800 --> 37:09.240
Well, in that case, maybe
I'll just take a quick look.

37:09.280 --> 37:13.480
<i>Focus, Elliot. Remember, we're here</i>
<i>to find out what kind of man she wants.</i>

37:13.560 --> 37:16.920
- How are we gonna do that?
- Well, she keeps a journal.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.160
Aha. And here it is.

37:20.240 --> 37:23.000
Right. I should be able to find some
information in here you'll find useful.

37:23.080 --> 37:26.600
- Hey, that's private stuff.
- Is it ever. Listen to this.

37:26.680 --> 37:29.720
"Last night was the most
incredible night of my life.

37:29.800 --> 37:33.640
<i>"I never did find out any of the guys'</i>
<i>names, but I brought them back here...</i>

37:33.720 --> 37:36.600
and all five of them banged me
like a Salvation Army drum."

37:36.680 --> 37:37.080
What?

37:37.080 --> 37:40.400
Just kidding. I could
have been a writer.

37:45.920 --> 37:50.000
<i>Hey, it's okay. She could bump</i>
<i>into you and she wouldn't feel it.</i>

37:50.040 --> 37:52.440
Now, this is good.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.840
"I meet many attractive men

37:54.880 --> 37:56.080
who are interested in me,

37:56.120 --> 37:59.960
"and while many of them are handsome
or clever or very successful,

38:00.040 --> 38:02.840
<i>"I find myself turning away</i>
<i>from them...</i>

38:02.880 --> 38:07.240
"and searching the horizon
for someone else.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.600
"I don't know who he is
or where I'll find him.

38:09.680 --> 38:13.920
"I only know that
he is a sensitive man.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.040
"He's a man who is in touch
with his emotions.

38:17.080 --> 38:20.320
"He's a man who's not afraid
to share his fears,

38:20.400 --> 38:22.800
"his disappointments
and his tears.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.240
<i>Where are you,</i>
<i>my sensitive man?"</i>

38:34.560 --> 38:37.360
Did you see that?

38:37.400 --> 38:41.240
She passed right through me.
We were one person for a split second,

38:41.320 --> 38:43.480
just like in <i>Ghost.</i>

38:43.560 --> 38:45.920
Darling, I've got an earthquake
in Chile in eight minutes.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.160
Any chance of making a wish here?

38:47.200 --> 38:50.480
Yes. I wish...

38:50.520 --> 38:52.880
I were the most
sensitive man in the world.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.840
Right. Okay.

38:54.920 --> 38:59.760
Wait! I wish I were the most
emotionally sensitive man in the world.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.960
Damn. I was hoping you
wouldn't catch that.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.040
I could have had a lot
of fun with that one.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.480
- And I want her to love me.
- Oh. You know what?

39:07.560 --> 39:09.720
I have a great feeling
about this.

39:09.800 --> 39:13.000
- You do?
- Yeah, but... what do I know, right?

39:24.240 --> 39:26.680
- Hey.
- I'm back, my love.

39:26.760 --> 39:27.960
Where did you run off to?

39:27.960 --> 39:29.920
I went to make a
garland of beach plums...

39:30.000 --> 39:32.880
to place atop your glorious head
like a crown.

39:34.360 --> 39:37.360
But then I caught sight
of that sunset and...

39:37.400 --> 39:40.120
I don't know, something
stirred inside me...

39:40.200 --> 39:43.320
and I had to stop and weep.

39:43.360 --> 39:46.760
<i>Mmm, it's beautiful.</i>

39:46.840 --> 39:48.680
It is.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.400
- There I go again.
- Tissue?

39:53.440 --> 39:56.320
No, I never wipe
my tears away.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.480
I'm not ashamed of them.
I wear them proudly,

39:59.560 --> 40:03.080
like small, wet, salty
badges of emotional truth.

40:03.160 --> 40:07.160
Elliot, um, there's something that
I think that we should talk about.

40:07.240 --> 40:11.960
Um, we've been together for
what, about three weeks now?

40:12.040 --> 40:15.120
- Three magical weeks.
- Three magical weeks.

40:15.160 --> 40:19.560
And I don't think that I've ever
met a man who's been more in touch...

40:19.640 --> 40:23.360
- with his feelings.
- I love you... so very much.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.560
I love you too.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.800
Dudley! Peter!

40:33.280 --> 40:35.160
I'm sorry.
They're such little devils.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.400
Come on, you naughty boys.
See ya.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.200
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

40:42.240 --> 40:45.320
Um, do you need comforting
on any level?

40:45.400 --> 40:47.240
No, no, no, I'm fine.

40:47.320 --> 40:51.320
Have I done or said anything to
make you feel less good about you?

40:51.400 --> 40:54.320
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
- Would you like something to eat?

40:54.400 --> 40:58.840
I made a salad nicoise
with dolphin-safe tuna.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.200
Oh, wow.

41:07.080 --> 41:10.240
- What is it?
- It's that sunset again.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.800
And I worry about the dolphins.
I wrote a song about them.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.200
Would you like to hear it?

41:15.280 --> 41:18.040
Now? l-l...

41:20.280 --> 41:23.280
# Mayo-nayo-naise ##

41:26.240 --> 41:31.480
# Swimming by the sandy shore
Dancing up among the waves #

41:31.560 --> 41:34.240
# Dolphin, dolphin I adore #

41:34.320 --> 41:36.720
# Everything you are #

41:36.760 --> 41:39.560
#You're so much more
than a fish to me #

41:39.640 --> 41:42.400
# My playful friend
beneath the sea ##

41:45.760 --> 41:48.520
- I have to stop.
- Good! I mean, oh, why?

41:48.600 --> 41:51.480
Because I'm looking at you
and I'm seeing all the beauty...

41:51.560 --> 41:54.600
of the world shining at me
through your eyes.

41:54.680 --> 41:58.000
- Would you mind if I sketched you?
- I didn't know you could draw.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.200
I'm not an artist, per se.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.040
Okay, Elliot, there's something
that I think I really have to say.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.800
Elliot, that's amazing!

42:09.240 --> 42:11.120
Compared to you, it's nothing.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.560
Compared to your smile...

42:13.600 --> 42:16.320
<i>and the blush of your cheek and</i>
<i>the sound of your voice as it</i>

42:16.320 --> 42:17.520
<i>floats on the evening breeze.</i>

42:17.600 --> 42:21.160
Compared to you,
that sunset's just...

42:24.480 --> 42:26.880
When is that darn thing gonna set?

42:26.960 --> 42:28.800
- Maybe we should go.
- No, wait.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.280
There's so much that I wanna say to you,
but I just can't find the words.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.760
I have an idea.
I would like...

42:35.840 --> 42:38.800
to improvise a sonnet
about your hair.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.720
How wonderful
my fair one's face...

42:48.480 --> 42:50.960
Excuse me, fellas.
Might I ask you to...

42:51.040 --> 42:53.880
take the horseplay down
to another part of the beach?

42:53.920 --> 42:56.280
Uh, no.

43:00.800 --> 43:05.000
<i>You know, rather</i>
<i>than get confrontational,</i>

43:05.080 --> 43:07.040
why don't we all
just sit down together,

43:07.120 --> 43:12.320
have some salad with dolphin-safe tuna
and see if we can't start a dialogue.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.000
You know, I had a feeling
that you were gonna...

43:16.080 --> 43:20.120
Okay, guys, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to ask you...

43:20.160 --> 43:23.680
to respect the moment that
my woman friend and I are sharing...

43:23.760 --> 43:27.480
because it's a special celebration
of love and caring...

43:27.520 --> 43:31.280
and a unique spiritual
and emotional understanding.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.720
- You wanna get a beer?
- Sure.

43:35.800 --> 43:38.680
Alison, excuse me, but I thought
that this was our time together.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.640
It's just a beer.
I'll be back in two seconds.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.880
Actually, my place
is like 40 minutes from here.

43:42.960 --> 43:45.520
- That's fine. Which way is your car?
- It's a van.

43:45.600 --> 43:46.040
Great.

43:46.040 --> 43:50.040
Alison, I respect your
uniqueness and individuality.

43:50.120 --> 43:53.720
And you're your own person, and if you
want to go with our new friends here...

43:53.760 --> 43:55.920
to get a drink,
I won't stand in your way.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.080
Okay, thanks, El.
I knew you'd understand.

43:58.080 --> 43:58.640
No, wait!

43:58.720 --> 44:00.920
Don't go! I can't handle
this kind of rejection!

44:00.920 --> 44:02.600
Why don't you wanna
stay here with me?

44:02.680 --> 44:06.280
You wanna know why?
Because you're just too sensitive!

44:06.360 --> 44:09.200
I'm about to go out of my mind here.
It's been wonderful,

44:09.280 --> 44:12.520
and God knows I love you,
but enough is enough!

44:12.600 --> 44:16.680
I just wanna be with a man who will
ignore me and take me for granted...

44:16.760 --> 44:19.000
and who's only pretending
to be interested in who I am...

44:19.040 --> 44:21.840
and what I think so
he can get into my pants.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.800
- That would be me.
- Oh, thank you!

44:25.880 --> 44:28.080
Let's get out of here.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.040
Alison, wait!

44:30.120 --> 44:32.600
<i>Alison!</i>

44:32.680 --> 44:35.240
I'll get into your pants!

44:51.680 --> 44:55.000
Oh, Elliot, get out of there,
you silly boy.

44:55.040 --> 44:59.200
- Oh, man, you are so bad.
- Why, thank you.

44:59.280 --> 44:59.960
Just admit it.

44:59.960 --> 45:03.040
You're not very good at this whole
instant travel thing, are you?

45:03.120 --> 45:05.720
I'm sorry. Now then,
what were we talking about?

45:05.760 --> 45:08.240
Oh, your next wish, wasn't it?

45:08.320 --> 45:10.560
Don't think I don't
see what you're doing.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.920
I make wishes, you think
up ways to ruin them.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.920
I've ruined them?
How can you say that?

45:16.960 --> 45:20.360
I'm not perfect, you know.
Do you think I enjoy this?

45:20.440 --> 45:25.280
I'm stuck in this horrible job
for eternity. Everybody hates me.

45:25.360 --> 45:27.560
I can't sleep. And when
I actually try to help someone,

45:27.640 --> 45:31.480
they turn on me like
I'm supposed to be God or something.

45:31.560 --> 45:34.680
Well, for your information,
my life is a living hell.

45:34.720 --> 45:38.120
I work hard.
I try to look good for you.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.240
You do look good.
You-You look very good.

45:41.320 --> 45:43.480
I just wanted you
to like me.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.080
Oh, come on. I do like you.

45:45.080 --> 45:47.760
It's just I'm feeling a
little frustrated here.

45:47.840 --> 45:51.000
Don't give up on me, Elliot.
I'm not giving up on you.

45:51.080 --> 45:55.480
Nobody gets it totally right right away.
You're doing great, really.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.680
- I am?
- Yeah, you are.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.960
I'm so sorry
your wish didn't work out.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.640
Friends?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.600
Sure.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.640
Listen, I'm sorry if I said anything
to upset you or make you feel bad.

46:10.720 --> 46:13.320
And I'm gonna try
to be more sensitive next time.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.400
I think you're
sensitive enough already.

46:15.400 --> 46:15.960
You think?

46:16.040 --> 46:18.360
Are you kidding?
You even went for me crying.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.320
Hey! Were you
just faking me out?

46:20.400 --> 46:25.160
I was 100% sincere. It's not easy
being the Barbra Streisand of Evil.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.480
Now, what have we learned so far?

46:29.560 --> 46:31.600
Well, let's see.

46:31.680 --> 46:34.200
I'm starting to think women
don't know what they want.

46:34.200 --> 46:34.520
Amen!

46:34.600 --> 46:38.080
They say they want sensitivity, but
did you see how fast Alison went for...

46:38.160 --> 46:41.360
- those tough-guy dudes on the beach?
- Which tells you?

46:41.440 --> 46:45.160
That... Well, it tells me
that I wanna be really big and strong.

46:45.240 --> 46:49.240
You know, I wanna have a great body
and be tall and... Like...

46:49.280 --> 46:51.160
- Go on.
- And I wanna be athletic.

46:51.200 --> 46:53.360
- Check.
- And I wanna be rich too.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.800
But I want it to be
for something that I like doing,

46:55.800 --> 46:57.080
and people really like me for.

46:57.120 --> 46:59.160
Great! This is getting
really specific.

46:59.200 --> 47:02.160
Let's see...
big, strong, rich, athletic,

47:02.240 --> 47:05.240
something you like,
lots of fans...

47:05.280 --> 47:08.280
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Oh, I hope so.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.400
In the form of a wish?

47:09.400 --> 47:11.600
I wish I could play
professional basketball.

47:11.680 --> 47:14.840
Then I'll just say
the magic words: Dennis Rodman.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.280
- 
- No!

47:17.320 --> 47:20.600
Just kidding.
Michael Jordan.

47:20.680 --> 47:22.960
Yeah!

47:24.440 --> 47:28.280
Three, two, one!

47:30.560 --> 47:32.320
<i>And that's it. That's the game.</i>

47:32.400 --> 47:36.200
<i>The fans are going nuts</i>
<i>here at the Forum in Los Angeles.</i>

47:36.280 --> 47:40.920
The score: 135 to 85.
Elliot Richards has totally dominated.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.640
If you're just tuning in,
it's a shame because you just missed...

47:43.680 --> 47:45.600
one of the greatest performances
in the history of sports.

47:45.640 --> 47:47.480
Absolutely, Jerry.
Absolutely.

47:47.560 --> 47:51.520
People said basketball caught fire with
the "ascendry" of Michael Jordan.

47:51.600 --> 47:54.200
But I tell you, after what
we seen here tonight,

47:54.280 --> 47:56.560
a lot of people are gonna
be saying, "Michael who?"

47:56.640 --> 47:59.760
<i> Right from the get-go, the</i>
<i>fans took a look at Elliot Richards...</i>

47:59.840 --> 48:02.120
<i>and a couple women fainted.</i>

48:02.200 --> 48:05.640
<i>And a couple fellas... I'd rather not</i>
<i>say...but they liked what they saw.</i>

48:05.720 --> 48:08.440
<i> Absolutely.</i>
<i>He's a big fella and an imposing fella.</i>

48:08.520 --> 48:11.640
<i>He's enormous. He's listed at 7'6"</i>
<i>in the program,</i>

48:11.720 --> 48:14.600
<i>but I'd say he plays the game</i>
<i>like he's 11 feet tall.</i>

48:14.680 --> 48:16.520
No, I don't think
he that big, Jerry.

48:16.600 --> 48:19.440
No, I'm saying the game
he plays is-is-is...

48:19.520 --> 48:21.520
is that of
some Viking giant...

48:21.600 --> 48:24.600
with a basketball in one hand
and a club in the other...

48:24.640 --> 48:27.120
standing 10, 11,
12 feet tall.

48:27.200 --> 48:31.680
<i>It's obvious Elliot Richards controlled</i>
<i>this game right from the tip-off.</i>

48:31.760 --> 48:36.000
<i>Right from the get-go, Elliot was</i>
<i>a dominating force in tonight's game.</i>

48:36.080 --> 48:39.120
<i>He was Phi Slamma Jamma</i>
<i>runnin' stank all over it...</i>

48:39.200 --> 48:42.200
<i>with rib-ticklin' jumps</i>
<i>of double vanilla funk.</i>

48:42.240 --> 48:45.880
<i>Let's take a look.</i>
<i>Here's a pass worthy of John Elway.</i>

48:45.920 --> 48:47.800
<i>For the dunk!</i>
<i>Such a beautiful play.</i>

48:47.840 --> 48:52.560
<i>Here he is lining up for the three.</i>
<i>And Ricola! It's good!</i>

48:52.640 --> 48:54.640
<i>Here comes his patented</i>
<i>over-the-shoulder,</i>

48:54.640 --> 48:55.600
<i>no-look three-pointer.</i>

48:55.680 --> 48:57.440
<i>And nothing but net!</i>

49:02.720 --> 49:05.680
<i>They're in the zone.</i>

49:05.760 --> 49:08.400
<i>Here he is soaring</i>
<i>through the air like the man...</i>

49:08.480 --> 49:10.960
<i>on the flying "trapezius,"</i>
<i>and bam!</i>

49:11.040 --> 49:13.720
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

49:13.800 --> 49:15.560
<i>Destroying the
backboard on the glass.</i>

49:15.560 --> 49:16.600
<i>This kid's an animal.</i>

49:16.640 --> 49:18.720
<i>Let's take a look
at that dunker again.</i>

49:18.720 --> 49:19.600
<i>It's boom!</i>

49:19.680 --> 49:22.760
<i>Humpty-hump-dump-dump.
Ha-ha!</i>

49:22.840 --> 49:26.200
<i>I love this game, folks.</i>
<i>I sure enough do.</i>

49:26.280 --> 49:28.760
<i>Elliot Richards</i>
<i>spitting glass at your ass.</i>

49:28.840 --> 49:31.840
Bob is courtside with Elliot Richards
now. Let's go to Bob Bob.

49:31.920 --> 49:32.920
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.

49:32.920 --> 49:35.160
Elliot, you must be one very
proud young man this evening.

49:35.200 --> 49:38.640
Simply put, that was a staggeringly
dramatic display of athletic ability.

49:38.720 --> 49:42.360
Uh, well, you know,
you go out there and you give 110%.

49:42.440 --> 49:45.040
And you wanna play good.
And you hope you play good.

49:45.120 --> 49:47.240
I think we played
pretty good tonight.

49:47.320 --> 49:49.280
Well, in the lexicon
of sports terminology,

49:49.280 --> 49:51.040
and I don't mean to
sound contrary here,

49:51.120 --> 49:53.040
the word "good"
falls tragically short

49:53.040 --> 49:55.760
of encompassing the sheer
virtuosity of your performance.

49:57.400 --> 50:00.800
Um, well, you know, there's
no "l" in the word "team,"

50:00.880 --> 50:02.720
and this is a team effort.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.680
And I just wanna say that I'm
real proud to be associated with...

50:05.760 --> 50:09.400
these fine individuals that
I have the pleasure of working with.

50:09.440 --> 50:12.480
Now, I would never wanna dis your
teammates in any way, shape or form,

50:12.560 --> 50:15.920
but you do realize that you smashed
Wilt Chamberlain's unbreakable record...

50:16.000 --> 50:18.080
of 100 points in a single
basketball game set in

50:18.080 --> 50:19.360
Hershey, Pennsylvania, years ago?

50:19.440 --> 50:23.000
Man, you just gotta play one game at
a time and go out there and give 110%...

50:23.080 --> 50:25.240
and you gotta show that you
want it more than they do

50:25.240 --> 50:26.560
when the chips fall where they may.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.320
Thank you very much.
Back to you, Jerry and Dan.

50:29.400 --> 50:32.120
All right! Diablos!

50:32.160 --> 50:35.000
Number one! Yeah!

50:38.280 --> 50:40.560
Elliot. Hi.

50:40.640 --> 50:43.840
Alison Gardner.
<i>The Sporting News.</i>

50:43.880 --> 50:47.080
Oh. It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

50:47.120 --> 50:50.240
God, I can't tell you
how thrilled I am to meet you.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.600
I was just wondering
if there was a possibility...

50:52.680 --> 50:55.760
you might consider
doing something exclusive with me,

50:55.760 --> 50:56.840
uh, for the magazine?

50:56.920 --> 51:01.520
Maybe more intimate,
one-on-one, just the two of us.

51:01.600 --> 51:05.800
Yeah, right.
I'd kill you in one-on-one.

51:05.880 --> 51:08.080
Shoot!

51:08.160 --> 51:10.920
God, it's so exciting to be here.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.200
I mean, uh, you must have
an enormously huge...

51:15.240 --> 51:17.280
talent to do what you do.

51:17.320 --> 51:21.000
Well, you know, you go out there
and you just give 110%.

51:21.080 --> 51:25.240
And, uh, you hope you play good.
You wanna play good.

51:25.320 --> 51:27.600
- <i>I bet.</i>
- I think we played pretty good tonight.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.480
<i>Oh, God, you were incredible tonight.</i>
<i>I mean, watching you,</i>

51:30.560 --> 51:33.640
I just kept thinking
how unbelievably big...

51:33.720 --> 51:36.800
your, uh, ego must be
after a game like that.

51:36.880 --> 51:39.040
Oh, not that big, really.

51:39.080 --> 51:42.880
- I bet it's pretty big.
- Well, I guess a little bit bigger.

51:43.920 --> 51:47.240
- It depends on how happy I am.
- Oh!

51:48.920 --> 51:51.360
- Whoo. God.
- Heck.

51:51.400 --> 51:55.680
Wanna go back to my place?
I'll show you my bottle cap collection.

51:55.720 --> 51:59.040
Oh, God, that would...
that would be tremendous.

51:59.120 --> 52:01.080
- All right, well...
- God.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.680
I should, uh...
I should get dressed.

52:03.720 --> 52:05.600
I can't wait.

52:12.560 --> 52:16.120
Oh, my God!

52:16.200 --> 52:19.000
Hey, what the hell!

52:19.080 --> 52:21.200
Oh, God, there's...

52:21.280 --> 52:23.920
Hey! Damn!

52:24.000 --> 52:25.840
- Um...
- Oh, heck!

52:25.920 --> 52:26.160
Oh!

52:26.160 --> 52:30.760
I just remembered there's
just this teeny, tiny thing...

52:30.840 --> 52:32.680
- I forgot to do.
- What's teeny?

52:32.760 --> 52:34.560
No, no, no.
It's something I have to write.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.040
About me?

52:35.080 --> 52:39.080
Yeah, just a little, short,
itty-bitty blurb about tonight's game.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.440
Well, uh, can I see you
after the road trip?

52:41.480 --> 52:44.760
I would love to, but I'm...
I'm working on a really big,

52:44.840 --> 52:50.080
huge, enormous story on the N.F.L.,
so I probably won't have time.

52:50.120 --> 52:53.840
Oh, shoot. I understand.
You gotta give 110%.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.760
- Right.
- Stay within yourself.

52:55.840 --> 52:59.360
Hey, oh, yeah.
Hey, um, thanks for your time.

53:01.960 --> 53:04.280
So long. Oh...

53:05.320 --> 53:09.000
What the hell?
Oh, damn the Devil.

53:09.080 --> 53:11.080
Damn the Devil to Hell!

53:11.160 --> 53:14.200
Oh, shoot! Darn it!

53:14.280 --> 53:17.280
Where the heck did
I put that...

53:23.400 --> 53:26.680
five, five, five.

53:26.760 --> 53:30.080
Seven, seven, seven.
Come on! Oh!

53:36.160 --> 53:38.000
Duh! Six, six...

53:40.040 --> 53:41.400
Now what are you doing?

53:41.400 --> 53:45.000
You seem so upset, Elliot.
Do you want something to relax?

53:45.080 --> 53:49.160
You bet I'm upset. You gave me,
like, this little teeny-weeny winkie.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.560
Well, that's easily fixed,
you know. Now then, let's see.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.560
Here's some M&Ms
for room 320.

53:55.640 --> 53:59.240
- Red Hots for 316.
- You're giving them candy?

53:59.320 --> 54:03.320
Placebos. They work just as well as
the real thing. It's a scientific fact.

54:03.400 --> 54:06.400
You can't give sick people
Tic Tacs!

54:06.440 --> 54:10.120
Sick people have notoriously bad breath.
I'm performing a public service here.

54:10.200 --> 54:12.040
Now then,
about your next wish.

54:14.080 --> 54:16.160
All right, okay. Um...

54:16.200 --> 54:19.680
Well, I wanna be smart.

54:19.760 --> 54:24.280
No, I wanna be really smart.
And I wanna be able to talk good... well.

54:24.360 --> 54:27.000
- What is the word...
- "Articulate"?

54:27.080 --> 54:29.680
Articulate. Yeah.
I wanna be articulate.

54:29.760 --> 54:33.160
And I wanna be witty
and sophisticated, charming.

54:33.240 --> 54:35.320
I wanna know everything
about everything...

54:35.400 --> 54:38.800
and I wanna be popular
and I wanna be good-looking.

54:38.880 --> 54:40.720
No, no, make that
great-looking.

54:40.800 --> 54:44.040
And I want Alison to fall absolutely
head over heels in love with me.

54:44.120 --> 54:47.280
- Anything else?
- Like what?

54:47.360 --> 54:49.200
Like winkie-wise?

54:49.280 --> 54:53.080
Oh, right. Um...

54:53.160 --> 54:55.280
Yeah, well, um,

54:55.360 --> 54:58.080
I wanna be...
I wanna be big.

54:58.120 --> 55:02.480
Not like practical joke big,
but, you know, sort of...

55:04.280 --> 55:06.200
Yeah, like that.
Is that clear?

55:06.280 --> 55:09.280
Crystal. You just say "I wish"
and I'll fill in the rest.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.200
Okay.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.920
I wish that I was witty
and articulate...

55:13.960 --> 55:17.240
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
You've got it, smarty-pants.

55:17.320 --> 55:20.640
Take two of these
and call me in the morning.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.760
<i>Oh, Elliot!</i>

55:38.840 --> 55:41.840
Oh, it so wonderful
to see you, darling.

55:44.520 --> 55:47.440
Oh, New York has been so
deadly dull without you.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.520
Where have you been?

55:48.600 --> 55:51.680
Oh, out in the Hamptons, of course.
Up to my ears in my new book.

55:51.760 --> 55:55.520
Another one? You've written
four books in three years. My God.

55:55.560 --> 55:58.240
- <i>What's this one about?</i>
- <i>Oh, same old, same old.</i>

55:58.280 --> 55:59.920
It's a critical deconstruction
of the Neo-Romantic period

55:59.920 --> 56:00.520
in art and literature...

56:00.600 --> 56:02.840
from the political
and economic perspective

56:02.880 --> 56:04.240
of the Industrial Revolution.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.720
I can't imagine
who reads this stuff!

56:08.160 --> 56:10.480
Well, Elliot,
the critics, apparently.

56:10.560 --> 56:14.560
It's already won the Pulitzer Prize
and it hasn't even been published yet.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.640
Well, like they say,
Dr. Oingegedaydegegedaybaba,

56:16.680 --> 56:19.440
a Pulitzer Prize and $3.50
will get you a cafe latte.

56:21.200 --> 56:24.280
So modest. Darling, you
really should get around.

56:24.280 --> 56:25.920
Everyone's dying to see you.

56:25.960 --> 56:27.840
Mingle.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.320
Oh, darling, you look fabulous.
Badgely Mishka?

56:35.400 --> 56:39.080
- What a charming man. Who is that?
- Oh, that's Elliot Richards.

56:39.120 --> 56:43.240
<i>He's a very successful writer.</i>
<i>He's a very successful everything,</i>

56:43.320 --> 56:45.280
as a matter of fact.

56:45.360 --> 56:48.840
That's Elliot Richards?
Oh, I've read all his books.

56:48.920 --> 56:51.400
<i>He's brilliant.</i>
<i>I had no idea he was so handsome.</i>

56:51.480 --> 56:53.800
<i>Well, why don't you</i>
<i>go over and talk to him?</i>

56:53.880 --> 56:56.600
- I couldn't. What would I say?
- I wouldn't worry about that.

56:56.680 --> 57:00.480
Just, uh, let him
do all the talking.

57:00.520 --> 57:04.440
It's a common misapprehension that the
word "gin" comes from the city Geneva.

57:04.520 --> 57:06.560
Actually, the word "geneva"...
small "g"...

57:06.640 --> 57:10.520
is a corruption of <i>genievre,</i> which
of course is french for "juniper,"

57:10.600 --> 57:13.080
the wonderful berry that flavors
this miraculous libation.

57:15.720 --> 57:18.280
Speaking of miraculous.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.400
I'm Elliot Richards.
How do you do?

57:20.480 --> 57:24.240
I know who you are.
I'm Alison Gardner.

57:24.320 --> 57:29.000
I just had to tell you how much
I loved your novel <i>Always Toujours.</i>

57:29.040 --> 57:32.240
Well, I was just trying
to make a simple point really.

57:32.320 --> 57:35.040
Every time I've reread
Camus and Sartre,

57:35.080 --> 57:36.960
I kept thinking to myself,

57:37.000 --> 57:40.880
"Why does the existential dilemma
have to be so damn bleak?"

57:40.960 --> 57:43.840
- Yes.
- Yes, we're alone in the universe.

57:43.920 --> 57:46.360
Yes, life is meaningless,
death is inevitable.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.400
But is that necessarily
so depressing?

57:48.480 --> 57:50.440
I couldn't agree more.

57:51.680 --> 57:54.160
Don't you think
that secular humanism is yummy?

57:54.240 --> 57:56.080
Ooh, delish.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.480
My, my.

58:05.520 --> 58:07.800
They say that alcohol
is a disinhibitor

58:07.800 --> 58:10.200
and it seems to be
working very well on me.

58:10.280 --> 58:12.120
Me too.

58:13.680 --> 58:16.160
What an exquisite feeling.

58:16.200 --> 58:21.080
Every cell in my body just wants
to reach out and touch someone.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.880
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it?

58:23.920 --> 58:25.880
Mm-hmm.

58:25.960 --> 58:28.360
Thy physiology of touch.

58:29.920 --> 58:33.120
Just below your epidermis,
concentrated in your fingertips,

58:35.040 --> 58:38.040
the palms of your hands,

58:38.120 --> 58:40.760
the soles of your feet,

58:40.840 --> 58:44.080
the clitoris, nipples, penis,

58:45.240 --> 58:48.760
lips, tongue.

58:48.840 --> 58:51.440
Thousands and thousands of tiny
little Meissner's corpuscles...

58:51.520 --> 58:55.480
all deliciously sensitive
to even the slightest caress...

58:55.600 --> 59:00.080
sending all those tiny little
endorphin-producing pleasure messages...

59:00.160 --> 59:02.480
to the hypothalamus...

59:03.520 --> 59:05.520
the primitive brain.

59:05.600 --> 59:07.880
I'm tingling all over.

59:09.120 --> 59:11.960
Do you know the largest organ
in the human body?

59:13.360 --> 59:15.400
I can guess.

59:15.480 --> 59:17.320
You'd be wrong.

59:18.240 --> 59:20.840
It's your integumentary system.

59:20.920 --> 59:23.360
Your...

59:23.440 --> 59:25.280
creamy...

59:25.360 --> 59:27.880
soft...

59:27.960 --> 59:31.080
and completely desirable skin.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.480
- Can we go to your place?
- <i>Mais certainment.</i>

59:41.880 --> 59:44.400
Oh, this is so perfect.

59:44.440 --> 59:47.040
Everything here
absolutely screams...

59:47.120 --> 59:50.000
"Elliot Richards."

59:50.080 --> 59:52.680
Actually, most of the screaming...

59:52.760 --> 59:54.600
takes place...

59:56.520 --> 59:58.360
in the bedroom.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.720
- What the hell is going on, Mary?

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.400
- Who are you?
- Don't play games with me, Mr. Richards.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.240
I'm in no mood.
I've been out of my mind all night.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.040
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.800
<i>Who's your little friend?</i>

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.520
- Maybe I should be running along.
- Wait. This is a mistake. I'm not gay.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.360
Oh, really?
And I'm Tony Danza!

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.480
- Honestly, I swear it. I'm not.
- Then tell me,

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.320
who was in the Broadway cast
of <i>The Pajama Game?</i>

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.120
Janis Paige, John Raitt,
Eddy Foy, Jr.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.560
I assume you mean the original cast

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.520
because there was a revival
in 1973 that starred...

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.400
Hal Linden and Barbara McNair...
I am gay!

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.560
- I rest my case.
- <i> Wait.</i>

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.680
I can prove to you
that I am not gay. Kiss me.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.760
<i>Oh! This is just sad!</i>

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.320
Will you shut up, bitch!
Please, Alison, let me kiss you.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.400
Remember the champagne
and the corpuscles?

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.680
All right, Elliot, kiss me.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.840
I'm gay. Well, thanks
for dropping by.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.880
- Good night.
- All right.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.880
Bu-bye.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.280
<i>You've been drinking again,</i>
<i>haven't you?</i>

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.840
This is like the night you had
all those Brandy Alexanders

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.720
and ran up and down Fire Island...

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.280
<i>with your cute little Speedos</i>
<i>singing "Evergreen."</i>

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.440
<i>And so the cow was returned</i>
<i>to its rightful owner.</i>

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.120
- Okay, boys, tonight's homework.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.760
Algebra. "X" to the nth plus "Y"
to the nth equals "Z" to the nth.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.160
You're never gonna
use that, are you?

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.600
"Imperialism and the first World War."

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.640
Well, what's done is done, I say.
No point in thinking about it now.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.480
"German, french, Spanish."

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.040
<i>Ja, ja. Oui, oui.</i>
<i>Si, si.</i> It's nonsense.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.920
Everyone speaks English anyway.
And if they don't, they ought to.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.480
So, no homework tonight.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.480
<i>But I want you to watch</i>
<i>a lot of television,</i>

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.960
<i>don't neglect your video games...</i>

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.320
and I'll see you in the morning,
shall we say, 10:00, 10:30?

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.240
No point in getting up
too early, is there?

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.000
Elliot, darling.
What a lovely surprise.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.080
- I hope you had a pleasant evening.
- As if you didn't know.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.000
Oh, I'm sorry, darling. I know it
must be really frustrating for you.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.200
I'll make it up to you somehow.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.600
Oh, yeah, you've been
a really big help so far.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.520
I know. I've been
really naughty, haven't I?

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.200
Maybe a good spanking's in order.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.480
Is that all you ever think about?
Do you think everything is about sex?

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.560
No, of course not.
I mean, there's greed, gluttony,

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.680
sloth, anger, vanity, envy.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.800
No, there's also honesty
and hard work...

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.160
and caring about people and
doing good for somebody else.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.680
Oh. You're just
a big Boy Scout, aren't you?

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.680
I find that
incredibly appealing.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.320
No! All I've been doing
is thinking about myself.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.720
I could be doing all these really
important things to help other people.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.400
- What about Alison?
- Oh, I don't know anymore.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.000
You mess it up anyway. I know that
Alison's not really like that.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.400
What exactly do you
have in mind?

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.720
I wanna do something
great for mankind.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.680
I wanna help create
a better world.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.320
I wanna go down in history for doing
something really, really important...

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.920
<i>and I want Alison to take me really</i>
<i>seriously and to treat me with respect.</i>

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.520
I sense a wish coming on.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.120
Yes!

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.120
I wish that I was the President
of the United States.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.240
That is the noblest,
most unselfish thing I've ever heard.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.120
And it's a great way
to meet girls.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.800
<i>Bless you, Elliot Richards,</i>

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.920
and Godspeed.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.560
Mr. President. Alison Gardner.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.080
We're so honored
to have you here, sir.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.640
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.760
<i>The actors are beside themselves</i>
<i>with excitement.</i>

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.040
We're going to a play?

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.960
I think you'll find it
quite amusing.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.480
It's called <i>Our American Cousin.</i>

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.080
I think I've already seen it.
As a matter of fact, I'm sure I have.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.280
I don't think you've seen it, sir.
It's an entirely new play.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.040
Really? I think I know
how it ends, anyway.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.160
- Can't we just go to a movie?
- A what?

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.800
- <i> The President!</i>

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.480
You seem tense tonight,
Mr. President.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.960
Oh, well, you know,
I have a lot on my mind,

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.280
what, with preserving the Union
and my wife going crazy and all.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.200
Can I help you find something,
Mr. President?

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.640
Yeah, I'm looking
for my pager.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.640
- Your what, sir?
- My pager. It's this...

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.800
little red plastic thingy.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.840
Looks kind of like
a cell phone, only smaller.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.320
<i>I'm sorry! Sorry!</i>

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.040
Ha! Ha! All right.
No problem. No problem!

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.600
<i>No problem! No problem.</i>

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.400
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.480
Wait!

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.400
Okay.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.000
You're late, Richards.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.320
Uh, yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.680
See that it doesn't. I don't think
a person with your extremely limited...

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.880
personal and professional skills
can afford to push the envelope.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.280
Yes, sir.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.440
Thank you, sir.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.360
- Creep.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.760
So, tell me, how was it?
I'm dying to know.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.680
What are you doing here?

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Just think of me
as a computer virus.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.200
I think of you as a plague.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.400
<i>Now, will you get off</i>
<i>my screen? I have work to do.</i>

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.120
Whoa. What's this whole
"get thee behind me" thing?

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.960
We still have business
here, Mr. Richards.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.320
No, not now.
I told you, I've got work to do.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.000
And besides, I've only got two wishes
left and I don't wanna screw 'em up.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.520
Correction.
You have one wish left.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.320
Nice try.
I've got two more coming.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.440
Nuh-uh. Count 'em, baby.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.200
<i>You were President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.080
Yeah, okay, one.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.680
You were a charming, handsome,

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.920
articulate, celebrated
author and raconteur.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.960
Uh-huh, yeah. And you turned me
into a flaming homosexual.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.280
- <i>Professional basketball player.</i>
- <i>Three.</i>

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.280
<i>The sensitive, caring,</i>
<i>artistic guy was four.</i>

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.720
And the Columbian drug lord was five.
That means I have two more coming.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.720
You forgot the Big Mac
and Coke.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.000
What? That wasn't a wish.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.000
<i>What do you call it? You said,</i>
<i>"I wish," and I got it for you.</i>

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.160
<i>Sounds like a wish to me.</i>

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.480
No! No, no, no.
No, that's not fair!

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.120
Fair? Who do you think
you're talking to?

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.120
<i>I don't recall anybody ever</i>
<i>accusing me of being fair before.</i>

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.400
I think I'm insulted.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.240
What? No, this isn't right.
You can't do this.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.160
Well, what are you gonna
do about it? Sue me?

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:45.120
No, that's it! I've had it with you.
The whole deal is off.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.040
<i>Off!</i>

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.000
Shut up!

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.720
Are you all right?

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.160
Uh, not really.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.960
Uh...

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.560
I need to talk to God.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:17.920
That's the power of prayer. Just say
what's in your heart and He hears.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.920
No, you don't understand.
I <i>really</i> need to talk to Him now.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.840
- It's urgent.
- Is it something you could tell me?

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.279
Um, no, it's personal.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:33.080
There's nothing you could say
that I wouldn't understand.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.240
Um...

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.439
Why don't you just try me?

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.040
Okay, a few days ago I sold my soul
to the Devil for seven wishes.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.479
I've already had five of them,
but the Devil says I've had six,

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.439
but I'm not counting
the Big Mac and Coke and she is
and I don't think that's fair.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:49.279
Do you?

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.399
- This is so unnecessary.
- You're coming downtown with us.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.960
I'm telling you, the Devil
gypped me for a hamburger!

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.520
Tell your story to the sergeant.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.960
So, do you have
a copy of this contract?

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.359
No. I told you,
she keeps it in her office.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:06.200
- At this nightclub in Oakland?
- Yes, at a nightclub,

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.240
and no I can't tell you
where it is.

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.240
Because you promised
the Devil you wouldn't?

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:12.240
No, because she drove,
that's why!

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:15.359
Right, in a Lamborghini Diablo.

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:18.000
- Look, Officer...
- Sergeant.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.920
Sergeant, I know my rights. I don't
have to talk to you without a lawyer.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.279
So, you either book me
or you let me go.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:28.439
Gee, are those my choices?
Oh, what do I do, what do I do?

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.439
I choose "book you."
Throw him in the lockup.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.240
Arraignment in the morning.
Drunk and disorderly.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:34.920
What? Hey!

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.680
- Recommending psychiatric evaluation.
- It's her! She's the Devil!

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.160
One more word out of you and I'll pop
you one, you goddamn wacko bastard.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.920
Now, move it.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.080
Spread 'em.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.640
There's no point
fighting about this.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.480
You have to learn
to accept the inevitable.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.880
We're all doomed anyway, so you might
as well just get with the program,

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.720
wish your way out of here
and move on.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:13.040
I wasn't kidding when I said
I liked you. I do, Elliot.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.080
I think you have
massive potential.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.280
If you're looking
at an eternity in Hell,

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.720
let me tell you, it wouldn't hurt
to have a friend like me.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.920
So you just think about that
and give me a call when you're ready.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.640
<i>She's the devil, that one.</i>

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.560
<i>What?</i>

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.600
I said, she's the devil,
that lady cop.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.520
Oh.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.600
Yeah, I guess.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.720
- So, what you in for, brother?
- Eternity.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.360
Ooh. That's a long time.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.520
You must've did
some really bad shit.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.440
Yeah.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.520
I sold my soul.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.680
Hope you got something
good for it.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.000
As a matter of fact,
I got nothing for it.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.680
That's a really bad deal,
if you ask me.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.920
I'm not asking you.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.760
Doesn't really matter, though.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.920
- You can't sell your soul, anyway.
- <i>Oh, really?</i>

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.160
Why do you say that?

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:43.400
Doesn't really belong to you
in the first place. No way, no how.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.800
So, who does it belong to?

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.040
It belongs to God,

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.240
that universal spirit that animates
and binds all things in existence.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.400
The Devil gonna
try to confuse you.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.320
<i>But that's her gig.</i>

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.880
<i>But in the end, you're gonna see</i>
<i>clear to who and what you are</i>

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.360
<i>and what you're here to do.</i>

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.600
Now, you're gonna make some mistakes
along the way. Everybody does.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.160
<i>But if you just open up</i>
<i>your heart...</i>

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.680
and open up your mind,

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.640
you'll get it.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.880
Who are you?

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.920
Just a friend, brother.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.360
Just a really good friend.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.560
<i>Elliot! Elliot!</i>

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.760
You the man, Elliot!

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.320
Elliot, darling.
So nice of you to drop by.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.640
Come into my office.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.160
Oh, don't worry about them, darling.
They're having a fabulous time.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.720
Pathetic, aren't they?

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:03.160
Everybody wants to go to the party,
but nobody wants to pay the piper.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:03.920
Are you...

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.920
Don't get too excited.
It's just a Halloween costume.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.800
<i>Anyway, Elliot, my darling,</i>
<i>have you thought of your last wish?</i>

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.080
No.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.040
I hate to put a rush on this,
but there is a time limit.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.200
Read your contract.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.760
I really don't want another wish.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.280
That's funny.
Do you think this halo's too much?

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.840
No. I really don't want it.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:41.040
What do you mean, you don't want it?
You get seven wishes.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.000
There's nothing I want.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.080
Well, there are things
that I want,

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.120
but nothing
that you can give me.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.200
What is that supposed to mean?

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.440
Well, um,

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.000
last night when I was lying in jail,
I was talking to this guy,

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.800
I realized that wishing
just doesn't work.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.720
All my life I wished
to be better looking,

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.600
to be richer, to be successful,
talented, whatever.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.360
And I always thought,

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.440
"Wouldn't it be great if someone
could just wave a magic wand...

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.360
and make that happen."

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.120
Well, I realized that
it doesn't work by magic.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.840
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.560
I've been starting
to think that...

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.040
it really isn't that important
how far we go in life anyway.

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.080
It's how we get there
that really matters.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.000
Oh.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.320
Do you know,
that is so inspiring.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.600
So, it's okay?

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.360
Well, no, Elliot.
I'm afraid it's not okay.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:39.440
<i>A deal's a deal. You get</i>
<i>one more wish and I get your soul.</i>

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.320
So, let's just get on
with it, shall we?

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.760
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Oh, really?

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.360
Well, before you get all hinky,
I think I should warn you,

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.680
I'm not all peaches
and cream, you know.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.360
I do have a darker side,
and believe me, it's not pretty.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.120
<i>Now, you can go easy</i>
<i>or you can go hard,</i>

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.160
but one way or another
I will get your soul!

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.240
I'm not gonna do it.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.360
There's nothing that you can
say or do that will make me.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.280
Oh, I think you'll
change your mind.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.280
I'm just gonna slip into something
a little more terrifying.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:09.920
See you in Hell!

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.520
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.520
<i>Wait a minute! Wait!</i>

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.680
Wait!

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.840
Now listen to me,
you disgusting little maggot!

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.200
This is your last chance
before the big weenie roast.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.320
Make a wish or
forever burn in Hell!

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.480
Okay! Okay!

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.000
I wish...

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.680
I wish that Alison
has a happy life.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.920
Oh, God.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.920
- Is this Heaven?
- <i>Heaven? God, no, it's the courthouse.</i>

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.880
I'm just meeting a couple of lawyers
for lunch... clients of mine. Come on.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.120
Well, wait.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.200
What happened to the whole...

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.080
you know, fire and
the big horny guy with the...

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.480
Oh, just a few special effects.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.080
Sort of the Universal Studios
Tour of Evil.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.760
Normally it works pretty well,
but evidently you weren't going for it.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.040
That last wish of yours
was a deal breaker.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:38.400
What?

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.640
Nobody ever reads the contract.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.440
Article 147, paragraph 9, subsection 3:
"Selfless Acts of Redemption."

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:48.040
- Huh?
- Basically, it says...

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.000
if you commit one truly benevolent act,
it voids the contract.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.480
- So I get to keep my soul?
- Yes, you get to keep your soul.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.480
Yes! Oh, yes!

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.680
Yes, I get to keep my soul!

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.320
Whoo! Hoo!

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.520
Hoo!

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.360
On November 16, I'll have
been doing this for 6,000 years...

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.320
and you're the first person
to give away one of their wishes.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.920
I hope it's not the
beginning of a trend.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.280
You're not gonna
tell anyone, are you?

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.600
No, no, I promise. Nope.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.360
I don't get it, though.
I mean, why are you... being nice?

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.560
Look, Elliot, I'm gonna
let you in on a little secret.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.600
The whole good and evil thing,
you know, Him and me,

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.800
it really comes down to you.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.200
You don't have to look
very hard for Heaven and Hell.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.640
They're right here on Earth.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.560
You make the choice.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.600
And I guess
you just made yours.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.680
So, I can go now?

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.920
Unless you want
another seven wishes.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.840
No thanks.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.920
I didn't think so.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.920
I really liked you, you know.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.200
Well, to tell you the truth,

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.640
you've been the best friend
I've ever had.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.760
Oh, dear.
Don't go gushy on me now.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.600
Go on. Go.
You'll scare the fish away.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.640
Alison. Hi.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.640
Hi. Oh, uh...

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.120
Elliot Richards.
We've met a couple of times.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.560
Yeah, I remember.
Hi. How are you?

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.920
I'm great. I'm exaggerating.
I'm... I'm good.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.640
<i>Um, the thing is we've been working</i>
<i>together here for the last four years,</i>

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.560
<i>and I've always noticed you</i>
<i>and thought that...</i>

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.040
you looked like, um,
a very interesting person.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.440
I don't know
how interesting I am.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:03.440
Well, the truth is I don't know you
and you don't know me,

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.240
<i>and I was thinking that if we were</i>
<i>to get to know each other that...</i>

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.480
there's a chance that
we just might hit it off.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.520
So I was wondering if you wanted
to go get a cup of coffee or...

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.400
That's really so nice of you.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.520
I'm seeing someone.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.160
Oh.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.600
Well, of course you are. You're...

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.920
He's sure one lucky guy.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.080
<i>Uh, listen, if it ever doesn't</i>
<i>work out with him, then...</i>

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.920
- That is so nice of you. Okay.
- No, thanks a lot.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.560
- I'll see you around.
- Okay, take care. Bye.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.320
- It's a joke.
- Right.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.960
What's he gonna...

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.280
Hey, Elliot, fo-felliot,
so-smelliot.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.520
What's up, dudester? Yeah.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:54.600
What do you say we go down
to the club tonight and we,

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.040
uh, pick up some chickettes?

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.160
Nice talking to you, Bob.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.800
- Hey.
- New neighbors?

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.720
Guess so.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.040
Hi. Oh, hi.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.240
<i>Hi. You must be</i>
<i>the boy next door.</i>

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.960
Do you wanna give me a hand?

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360
<i>Habla ingles?</i>
<i>Sprechen Sie</i> English?

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.520
<i>Parlez vous Americano?</i>

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:58.480
- Hi. I'm Elliot Richards.
- Hey. Nicole DeLarusso.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.400
Don't call me Nicky, though.
'Cause everyone always calls me "Nicky."

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.920
It starts off as Nicole,
then it becomes Nicky,

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.600
then Nick, then Ni, then just "Nn."

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.560
People just call me "Nn."
I'm cracking myself up here.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.800
- Hey, do you wanna give me a hand?
- Yes, I do.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.800
- Okay.
- Oh, wow. You got the new Ingebritzens.

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.120
- Oh, yeah, they're the best.
- <i>They're the best.</i>

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.640
Um, so listen, I'd be happy
to hook these up for you...

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.800
so you could have some
music if you wanted,

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.320
you know, while you're unpacking.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.000
I could make us some dinner.
That way you wouldn't have to cook.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.200
Yeah, right.
Me cook.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.120
Thank you.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:36.080
Say, Nicole, you wouldn't happen
to have a sister, would you?

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.360
No, no. I have a lot
of brothers, though.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:44.080
<i># Hey, hey, did you ever think</i>
<i>there might be another way #</i>

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.720
<i># To just feel better</i>
<i>To just feel better about today #</i>

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:54.360
<i># Oh, no, if you never wanna</i>
<i>have to turn and go away #</i>

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:58.240
<i># You might feel better</i>
<i>You might feel better if you stay #</i>
