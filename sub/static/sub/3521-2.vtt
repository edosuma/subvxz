00:05.021 --> 00:07.524
John gotti.
Life in prison.

00:07.891 --> 00:10.393
No chance of parole.

00:10.393 --> 00:12.896
We've seen arrests
and prosecutions...

00:12.896 --> 00:16.399
in florida and elsewhere
of top mob figures.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.402
What are you doin'?
Put that back.

00:19.402 --> 00:23.907
- What's the situation
on the ground today,

00:24.407 --> 00:26.409
right now, in the mob?

00:26.409 --> 00:30.663
Confusion, instability,
vacuum at the top.

00:30.663 --> 00:33.666
What caused the decline?
Your sister's ass.

00:33.666 --> 00:38.805
An aggressive government policy
over two decades
to behead the crime families.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.307
But wasn't it,
at least in part,

00:41.808 --> 00:44.811
a disregard
within the mob itself...

00:44.811 --> 00:49.065
of the rules
that served the old dons
so well?

00:49.065 --> 00:51.067
The shoe fits.
Oh, no doubt.

00:51.568 --> 00:55.071
So, cheer me up,
babe.

00:55.071 --> 00:59.576
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

00:59.576 --> 01:02.579
Huh? Is that pacino
or is that pacino?

01:02.579 --> 01:05.582
- Fuckin' spittin' image.
- Vincent rizzo.
- Yes.

01:05.949 --> 01:08.451
Former soldier
in the genovese family.

01:08.451 --> 01:11.704
Government witness
turned best- selling author.

01:11.704 --> 01:15.842
- Do you agree
with u. S. Attorney braun?
- The party's over.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.844
He is a wiseguy.
Please elaborate.

01:18.344 --> 01:20.346
It's not like it was.
Cloning.

01:20.346 --> 01:23.349
- Mexicans are huge in that.
- Fascinating, gotta admit it.

01:23.349 --> 01:26.352
'Cause they work
as parking valets.

01:26.352 --> 01:30.723
Do i mean that organized crime
is just gonna pack its bags
voluntarily...

01:30.723 --> 01:32.725
and go the way
of the dodo bird?

01:33.109 --> 01:36.112
Vincent, they're not
going the way of the dodo bird--
what you talkin' about?

01:36.613 --> 01:38.615
- Mexicans.
- What about them?

01:39.115 --> 01:42.118
- Cell phones.
- I'm not talkin'
about clonin' cell phones.

01:42.619 --> 01:45.622
Jesus. I'm talkin'
about fuckin' sheep, science.

01:45.622 --> 01:49.125
I tell my kids,
"only god can make a life."

01:49.125 --> 01:52.128
Guy here asks,"what if
they had cloned princess di?"

01:52.495 --> 01:58.001
But, you know, the heyday,
the golden age or whatever
of the mob?

01:58.134 --> 02:01.137
That's gone,
and that's never comin' back.

02:01.137 --> 02:04.641
And they have only themselves
to blame.

02:04.641 --> 02:08.144
Ah, va a napoli.
They pay thischiacchierone
by the word?

02:08.511 --> 02:10.646
- I think
it's drug trafficking.
- Oh!

02:11.147 --> 02:15.401
I think that ruined everything.
You're lookin' at
a mandatory 35 to life...

02:15.518 --> 02:19.272
in prison, and guys started
to rat on each other just so
they could avoid prosecution.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.408
What's goin' on with
that princess di thing?

02:22.909 --> 02:25.912
Do you think the royal family
had her whacked?

02:25.912 --> 02:28.915
Last time i take a fuckin' limo
in paris.

02:28.915 --> 02:32.535
- Like you were
ever in paris, paulie.
- I went over for a blow job.

02:32.535 --> 02:36.539
Your mother was
working the bonbon concession
at the eiffel tower.

02:36.539 --> 02:40.543
So, did you hear what
i told him? I told him
i went over for a blow job.

02:40.543 --> 02:43.546
"Your mother was
workin' the bonbon concession
at the eiffel tower."

02:44.047 --> 02:46.549
Got a list of people
long as my leg
i wouldn't want cloned.

02:46.683 --> 02:49.185
The fuckin' mayor of new york,
that's the guy least likely
to get cloned.

02:49.185 --> 02:52.055
So, the code of silence
or theomerta...

02:52.055 --> 02:55.441
or whatever you wanna call it
just went by the boards.

02:55.942 --> 02:59.062
You're always
gonna have organized crime,
always.

02:59.562 --> 03:02.065
As long as the human being
has certain appetites...

03:02.065 --> 03:06.069
for gambling, pornography
or whatever,

03:06.069 --> 03:09.072
someone's always gonna surface
to serve these needs.

03:09.572 --> 03:14.577
Always.
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:05.905 --> 05:08.908
- You got dvd players
in back?

05:08.908 --> 05:12.412
Don't hurt me, man.
Only people get hurt, the ones
who try to be fuckin' jerk- offs.

05:12.412 --> 05:16.165
Okay? Now, step down,
nice and easy. Come on.
Move it.

05:16.165 --> 05:18.167
Come on.
He's got the dvd players.

05:18.167 --> 05:22.171
Hey, quick and painless.
Nobody wants to hurt your ass.
Okay, but you gotta tie me up.

05:22.171 --> 05:25.174
You gonna be a jerk- off now?
My boss is gonna think
i'm in on it.

05:25.174 --> 05:27.293
What? Do we look like
we're tryin' for a merit badge?

05:27.293 --> 05:31.798
- We travel around with rope?
- I've got some in the cab.
Please. I need this job.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.801
- Jesus christ. Get a rope.
- I don't know who in
the company gave up the route,

05:34.801 --> 05:38.805
but there's no way
i could walk away unscathed
without being fired.

05:38.805 --> 05:41.808
- You wanna be scathed?
- Yeah, so it looks like
i didn't give up...

05:41.808 --> 05:44.444
without a struggle.

05:47.947 --> 05:51.451
- Oh!
- That's cool.
Thank you, man.

05:51.451 --> 05:55.455
- That- that's enough.
- No. Wait.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.959
Cool. That's cool.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.962
Scathed? Scathed.
Scathed.

06:07.417 --> 06:10.420
Mr. Miller,
my science teacher,
he got his car stolen.

06:10.420 --> 06:12.922
You're kidding.
From where? His house?

06:12.922 --> 06:14.924
Mm- mmm. Right
from his parking spot
at school.

06:15.425 --> 06:18.428
A saturn. He only
had it, like, a year.

06:18.428 --> 06:20.430
The security people
at the school are a joke.

06:20.930 --> 06:24.934
Did you hear
what anthony jr. Just said?
Mr. Miller's car got stolen.

06:25.068 --> 06:27.570
Refresh my memory.
Who's he again?

06:27.570 --> 06:30.073
Your son's science teacher?

06:33.076 --> 06:36.579
- You're up early, dad.
- He just bought that car
a year ago.

06:36.946 --> 06:40.450
- So? Insurance'll pay.
- Yeah, but they don't
give full value.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.202
These poor teachers,
they don't make a lot.

06:43.202 --> 06:46.205
So he can work
a summer vacation.
Yeah.

06:46.589 --> 06:49.342
- Maybe you could help find it.
- Funny.

06:49.342 --> 06:52.345
I thought i told you
i changed my name from lojack
to anthony soprano.

06:52.462 --> 06:55.965
Laugh. I thought i'd pee
my pants. Seriously, though,
pussy's got the body shop.

06:55.965 --> 06:59.102
- He couldn't ask around?
-
i'm late.

06:59.102 --> 07:02.605
What are you
getting in science?
D+.

07:02.605 --> 07:05.108
See what i can do.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.728
That's not what i meant.
He's gotta work for his grades.

07:19.989 --> 07:22.492
I'm going
back to bed.
Bye, dad.

07:22.492 --> 07:25.378
See you later.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.247
Here. Eat this.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.758
Technology comes
to the bing!

07:38.758 --> 07:40.760
Hey, christopher,
where you been?

07:40.760 --> 07:43.262
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.

07:43.763 --> 07:46.766
Hey. Is the load here?
- Yeah.

07:48.768 --> 07:51.270
Georgie,
if a guy named serge calls,
you tell him i'll be right back.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.773
Ton',
these new phone systems--
hold, conference--

07:53.773 --> 07:57.660
- sometimes i get confused.
- How complicated is it?

07:57.660 --> 07:59.662
You answer the phone;
you take the fuckin' message.

07:59.662 --> 08:04.033
The voice mail only comes on
if you let the phone ring.
Jesus christ, georgie.

08:12.925 --> 08:16.679
- I hear there's not as many
titles available as on laser.
- There's more comin', though.

08:16.679 --> 08:19.682
My internist told me
the picture's not that different
from the laser either, ton'.

08:19.682 --> 08:22.185
But the sound?
Way improved.

08:22.185 --> 08:24.687
Good.
'Cause nothin' beats...

08:24.687 --> 08:27.690
poppin' up
some orville redenbacher's
and listenin' tomen in black.

08:27.690 --> 08:30.193
All right. Fuck it.
Hey. No, no. It's the
goddamn wires, that's all.

08:30.193 --> 08:33.196
I'll be glad to hook it up,
ton'. You know, i used
to be an installer.

08:38.067 --> 08:42.572
Why can't you
be nice to brendan?
We discussed that.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.711
Ton', i was just gonna
come lookin'. It's
the guy...for you.

08:48.711 --> 08:51.214
Serge?
I'll take it over there.

08:58.221 --> 08:59.722
Serge?

09:02.225 --> 09:05.228
You press "hold"
when you transfer a call.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.980
I'm sorry, tony.

09:10.983 --> 09:16.606
- Now he's not gonna call back.
- Brend's a good earner, t.
This jack was his plan.

09:16.606 --> 09:20.109
Yeah, he's a good kid, but i
don't like that methamphetamine.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.997
Fuck. I gotta
call my mother.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.873
Hello?
Hello? Ma?

09:33.873 --> 09:37.376
Ah, look who calls!

09:37.376 --> 09:40.379
How you doin'?
I was wonderin' when
you were gonna call.

09:40.763 --> 09:44.267
Well, you can stop
wonderin' now. This is it.
I'm callin' ya.

09:44.267 --> 09:47.770
Uh, i called you yesterday,
remember? You were supposed
to call me back?

09:48.271 --> 09:52.775
I phoned your house.
Some operator
answered the phone.

09:52.775 --> 09:54.777
I couldn't understand
a word she was saying.

09:55.144 --> 09:56.646
Ma, how many times
i gotta tell ya?
That's not an operator.

09:57.146 --> 10:01.033
That's an answering machine.
Oh, fancy, fancy.

10:01.033 --> 10:04.537
Here. Let me turn the heat off
under these mushrooms.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.545
You and my mother,
you're like two peas in a pod.

10:13.045 --> 10:16.666
She can't master the phone
either, but she's 70 years old.
What's your fuckin' excuse?

10:24.423 --> 10:26.425
What is she doin' now?

10:33.933 --> 10:35.935
Oh, my god.

10:36.435 --> 10:39.438
Oh, my god!
Ma.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.442
Ma?

10:44.443 --> 10:47.947
Hey, ma!

10:50.449 --> 10:52.952
Oh, my god!
Ma?

10:53.452 --> 10:56.339
Where the hell is she?
Who is this?

10:56.339 --> 10:59.842
It's anthony.
The mushrooms--
they're on fire.

11:00.209 --> 11:02.461
All right, ma. Get
the fire extinguisher under
the sink, the one i gave you.

11:02.461 --> 11:06.215
- Get it.
- Oh, my god! The wall's
gettin' all black!

11:06.465 --> 11:08.467
All right, ma.
Hang up and call 911.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.469
Ton', the guy's
on the second line.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.606
Aren't you coming over?
Press "hold," goddamn it!

11:13.973 --> 11:15.975
Listen, ma.
I can't come over.
I'm 40 minutes away.

11:16.475 --> 11:19.478
You hang up, call 911
and leave the house.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.114
Look at how i live.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.484
Ma, hang up
and call 911.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.994
Hello?
Carmela, my mother's
got a fire in the kitchen.

11:35.244 --> 11:38.247
Oh, my god.
She's callin' 911.
Can you get over there?

11:38.247 --> 11:41.884
Yeah. I'm on my way.
Thank you, baby.
I know you're busy.

11:41.884 --> 11:46.005
Serge. Serge? Listen.
I can't talk to you
right now.

11:46.389 --> 11:49.392
I gotta go
to an outside line.
Give me your number.

11:50.893 --> 11:53.646
All right. All right.
I'll call you back.

11:53.646 --> 11:57.400
Is your mom okay?
This shit cannot go on
like this.

11:58.901 --> 12:02.905
Hey, t. Hey, t.
This teacher--
they stole his car.

12:02.905 --> 12:07.910
You got a plate number?
Call my wife.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.667
Have a nice day, ma'am.
Thanks, fellas.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.169
No problem.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.678
Ma,

12:25.678 --> 12:29.181
i wish you would let me
get somebody in here
to help you.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.685
You shouldn't be alone.
Help me what?

12:34.186 --> 12:38.307
- With the housework.
- I have my ways.

12:38.307 --> 12:41.310
A stranger could care less
about doing it right.

12:41.444 --> 12:45.948
Can i tell you something,
though, ma?
You need company.

12:45.948 --> 12:49.952
Now, don't start with that
nursing home business again.

12:49.952 --> 12:53.456
This is not a nursing home.
It is a retirement community.

13:00.463 --> 13:03.833
You want me to make you
a littlepastin, put a little
something in your stomach?

13:08.337 --> 13:11.340
Ma, i've told tony...

13:11.340 --> 13:15.845
and i've told you many times.

13:15.845 --> 13:20.483
- You can always
come and live with us.
- I know when i'm not wanted.

13:22.601 --> 13:26.605
I just invited you to come and
share my home. If you want me
to beg, that's different.

13:28.607 --> 13:31.110
Leave this place...

13:31.110 --> 13:33.612
that my husband
and i shared?

13:33.612 --> 13:36.615
Change can be a positive.

13:37.116 --> 13:40.119
He was a saint.

13:43.622 --> 13:48.127
That son of mine, is he
still having those fits?

13:49.378 --> 13:52.882
They're not fits, ma.
They're anxiety attacks.

13:52.882 --> 13:55.384
He's on medication.

14:02.057 --> 14:05.060
What bmw's
charging us for paint?

14:05.060 --> 14:09.565
- Been that way
for six months.
- When was i last here?

14:10.566 --> 14:13.068
Hey...

14:14.069 --> 14:16.572
we maybe
caught a break here, boss.

14:16.572 --> 14:18.574
Shop on watchung avenue...

14:18.958 --> 14:21.460
said some guy's brought in
a saturn with these plates,
tryin' to unload it for parts.

14:21.827 --> 14:25.331
Are you tellin' everybody this
fuckin' car's for tony soprano,
and leave it in one piece?

14:25.714 --> 14:28.717
Yeah. Sure.
It's for the kid's teacher.

14:29.218 --> 14:32.221
My guys said that
one of those goofballs
had a uniform on...

14:32.221 --> 14:35.090
from, uh, buttfucks.

14:35.090 --> 14:37.977
Whatever. The coffee shop.
I guess the guy works there.

14:38.477 --> 14:41.347
Watchung avenue
and what?

14:42.348 --> 14:45.351
I'm fuckin' rockford
over here.

14:49.104 --> 14:53.609
Decaf cappuccino prima
nonfat magnifico,
double espresso regolare.

14:54.109 --> 14:56.111
I'll take you
over here, sir.

14:56.612 --> 15:01.116
Um, i think
i'll have an espresso.
Paulie, you want anything?

15:01.116 --> 15:06.121
- They got any just coffee?
- Our cafe du jour
is new zealand peaberry.

15:06.121 --> 15:09.124
Marrone. Whatever.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.127
That's 4. 20.
Pick it up over there.
One medium du jour.

15:12.127 --> 15:15.631
One single espresso regolare.
Yeah. Keep it.

15:15.631 --> 15:19.134
Du jour, espresso, coming up.
- Honey, let me ask you.

15:19.134 --> 15:22.638
My wife was in the body shop
around the corner on
watchung avenue the other day.

15:22.638 --> 15:26.642
The guy in front of her leaves,
and she sees he dropped...

15:26.642 --> 15:29.645
his money clip,
but he was already gone.

15:30.145 --> 15:32.147
And we'd like
to get it back to him.

15:32.147 --> 15:36.151
She said he was wearing
a uniform like that there.

15:36.151 --> 15:39.154
Real black hair, she said,
tall, little earring.

15:39.154 --> 15:43.158
- I'm sorry, sir, but
these stores are everywhere.
- Tell me about it.

15:48.547 --> 15:52.051
Fuckin' italian people.
How did we miss out
on this?

15:52.051 --> 15:55.554
What?
Fuckin' "expresso,"
cappuccino.

15:55.554 --> 15:59.058
We invented this shit,
and all these other cocksuckers
are gettin' rich off it.

15:59.058 --> 16:03.062
Yeah. Isn't it amazing?
It's not just the money.
It's a pride thing.

16:03.062 --> 16:06.065
All our food.
Pizza. Calzone.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.567
Buffalo mozzarella.
Olive oil.

16:08.567 --> 16:13.572
These fucks had nothin'. They
ate poopsie before we gave'em
the gift of our cuisine.

16:13.572 --> 16:19.194
But this, this is the worst,
this "expresso" shit.
Take it easy.

16:20.696 --> 16:24.199
So she finally agreed
to have somebody
come in days.

16:24.700 --> 16:29.705
Carmela called an agency,
and they sent over
this trinidadian woman.

16:30.706 --> 16:34.710
No matter what i do,
i feel guilty.

16:34.710 --> 16:36.712
Why?

16:38.714 --> 16:42.217
Well, the real reason is
i know i can't let her
live with us.

16:42.217 --> 16:46.105
That doesn't
seem very practical,
given her personality.

16:47.606 --> 16:50.609
It's my wife.
She won't allow it.

16:50.859 --> 16:52.861
Where are your sisters
in all of this?

16:52.861 --> 16:57.366
Oh, they cut it off with her
a long time ago. No way
she's bunkin' with them.

16:57.366 --> 17:02.371
So you're carrying
all this guilt when your mother
is clearly someone...

17:02.371 --> 17:05.874
who has great difficulty
in maintaining a relationship
with anyone.

17:07.876 --> 17:12.381
But she's my mother.
You're supposed to take care
of your mother.

17:12.881 --> 17:17.886
- She's a little old lady.
- Not to you.
She's very powerful.

17:17.886 --> 17:21.890
- Bullshit.
- You accord
this "little old lady"...

17:22.391 --> 17:25.394
an almost mystical ability
to wreak havoc.

17:25.394 --> 17:28.897
Let me tell ya something.
You definitely don't
wanna get her started.

17:29.398 --> 17:31.900
There are some people who...

17:31.900 --> 17:35.404
are not ideal candidates
for parenthood.

17:35.404 --> 17:37.406
Come on.
She's an old sweetie pie.

17:37.906 --> 17:42.411
What were some
of the good experiences
you remember as a child?

17:42.411 --> 17:45.914
The loving, warm ones.

17:55.924 --> 17:58.927
One time we were down
at the shore,

17:58.927 --> 18:02.431
about'68, '69,
the whole family.

18:02.431 --> 18:07.936
My father, he tripped
and he fell down the stairs,
and we were all laughin'.

18:07.936 --> 18:11.940
The whole family was laughin'.
My mother was laughin'.

18:13.442 --> 18:15.944
Any other loving experiences?

18:15.944 --> 18:18.447
Hey, she's a good woman.

18:18.447 --> 18:22.451
She put food
on that table every night.

18:22.451 --> 18:25.954
I'm the ungrateful fuck
'cause i come here
and complain about her,

18:26.455 --> 18:29.958
and i let my wife
exclude her from my home.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.091
Hey, ma?

18:48.594 --> 18:50.596
You perrilyn?
Yes.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.599
Tony soprano.
Ah.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.101
How you doin'?
I'm fine, thank you.

18:58.604 --> 19:01.607
Olivia, your son is here!

19:01.607 --> 19:06.495
Isn't he a handsome thing?
And look what he brought!

19:09.498 --> 19:12.501
Listen. Let's
get one thing straight.

19:12.501 --> 19:18.006
In the hours you're here
takin' care of my mother,
no ganja, okay?

19:18.507 --> 19:21.009
Hey, ma! Fiore!

19:22.010 --> 19:26.014
I'm not dead,
unfortunately for some.

19:26.014 --> 19:29.017
The tall ones
are delphiniums.

19:29.017 --> 19:32.020
You know, frankie valli,
when he visits jersey,

19:32.020 --> 19:34.523
this is the florist
he uses.

19:34.523 --> 19:39.027
Aren't they beautiful?
You want me to put them on
the dining room table, olivia?

19:39.027 --> 19:42.898
You make sure
the bottom of that vase
isn't wet.

19:42.898 --> 19:48.036
- Mr. Tony, would you
like some tea or something?
- Coke. Thanks.

19:54.042 --> 19:57.546
So how's it
goin' today?

19:57.546 --> 20:00.916
- She's stealing.
- Who?

20:00.916 --> 20:03.418
That ditsoon,"who."

20:03.418 --> 20:08.924
That beautiful plate
that aunt settimia took
from that restaurant in rome--

20:08.924 --> 20:11.426
it's gone.

20:11.426 --> 20:13.929
I don't know, ma.
She seems like a nice person.

20:14.429 --> 20:16.932
She doesn't fool me
for a second.

20:22.437 --> 20:27.943
Sure she stole it?
Sure you didn't give it
to one of the relatives?

20:27.943 --> 20:31.446
You keep forcing
your possessions on people,
thinkin' you're gonna die.

20:31.947 --> 20:34.950
I wish it was tomorrow.

20:39.705 --> 20:44.710
- Who does she think she is?
- She's happy, ma.
She's singin'.

20:44.710 --> 20:49.214
Anthony, i don't
want her around here.
I can manage somehow.

20:49.214 --> 20:54.469
No. No. I'm not cavin'
into you this time. She stays.

21:00.475 --> 21:03.478
Your uncle called here
lookin' for ya.

21:03.612 --> 21:07.366
- Uncle jun'?
- He sounded agitated.

21:09.868 --> 21:13.739
Jackie,
you're the boss. Tell'em
to leave comley trucking alone.

21:13.739 --> 21:16.491
Didn't know
it was a comley truck.

21:16.992 --> 21:21.496
For 21 fuckin' years, comley's
been puttin' food on my table.
Protection money.

21:21.496 --> 21:24.383
- Chris didn't know goin' in.
- Bullshit.

21:24.383 --> 21:27.386
You want my dvd player?
You can watchgrumpy old men.

21:27.886 --> 21:32.391
- You're gonna be a fuckin'
funny boy too, now, huh?
- Hey, you're sopranos.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.893
But, jackie, you go around
hopin' you and your uncle
can settle a thing,

21:34.893 --> 21:37.396
just the two of you,
not be invited to
a fuckin' sit- down.

21:37.396 --> 21:40.899
You got fuckin' chiricahuas
workin' for you. You don't
control'em.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.903
- Here we go.
- Jackie, you got a ruler?

21:48.407 --> 21:50.909
The kids who hit that truck,
they make restitution to junior.

21:51.410 --> 21:54.413
Done. It's done.

21:56.915 --> 21:59.918
Christopher montisanti's
a fuckin' loose cannon.
And that filone kid--

21:59.918 --> 22:03.422
- for this, you get a man
out of a sick bed?
- Hey, fuck that shit.

22:07.426 --> 22:10.929
Giacobbe,
how you feelin'?

22:10.929 --> 22:13.932
I may be acting boss
while the old man's
a guest of the government,

22:14.433 --> 22:17.436
but i wish somebody'd
tell my bowels,
'cause they don't obey.

22:19.938 --> 22:23.442
The fuckin' chemo.

22:23.442 --> 22:27.946
- Maybe i should
name a successor.
- This day and age?

22:28.447 --> 22:31.450
Who wants the fuckin' job?

22:31.450 --> 22:34.453
Your mom tells me
you got a girl comin' in
to help?

22:35.954 --> 22:38.957
That's good.

22:38.957 --> 22:41.960
All right. I gotta go.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.330
I'll see you soon.
Okay.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.336
We okay?
All right.

22:54.589 --> 22:57.092
A smoke he hires
for his own mother.

23:00.729 --> 23:03.231
Hey, mikey,
how's the boy?

23:03.231 --> 23:05.233
What boy is that, ton'?
The one you sleep with.

23:05.233 --> 23:08.236
Ohh.
I was just kiddin' ya.
How you doin'?

23:08.737 --> 23:10.238
I'm all right.
How's my uncle
treatin' ya?

23:10.739 --> 23:12.741
We're coverin' our nut.
Hey, your nephew, what's he,
retarded?

23:13.241 --> 23:15.744
He likes to play
with trucks or somethin'?
"Retarded"?

23:15.744 --> 23:19.247
What if jerry lewis heard
you talkin' like that?
Oh, that's muscular dystrophy.

23:19.247 --> 23:22.751
It's too bad
they don't have a telethon
for fuckface- itis, huh?

23:22.751 --> 23:27.255
They found a cure yet?
Come on. I was just
kidding you.

23:27.255 --> 23:29.257
Come on.
You're a good sport.
Come on. All right.

23:29.257 --> 23:31.760
You all right?
You all right?
Yeah. I'm all right.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.262
You all right? Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.

23:36.214 --> 23:39.935
Double cappuccino
suprema.
Double
cappuccino suprema.

23:42.938 --> 23:46.441
Excuse me.
Large nonfat latte.

23:46.441 --> 23:49.694
A guy fittin' the description
does work in this here branch.

23:50.195 --> 23:53.698
His name is eduardo arnaz.
Him and his gay lover
both work here,

23:53.815 --> 23:56.318
and i got the address.

23:56.318 --> 23:59.821
Paulie,
you listenin' to me?
Yeah.

23:59.821 --> 24:02.824
Oh, again with the rape
of the culture.

24:02.824 --> 24:06.328
Can we go find
these spice girls already
and get this over with?

24:08.213 --> 24:11.967
Two small cafe du jours.

24:13.218 --> 24:14.836
Half cap on one.

24:21.476 --> 24:23.478
What?

24:23.979 --> 24:26.982
That's it!
What happened?

24:26.982 --> 24:31.987
Beats me.
Did you say something
to her?

24:31.987 --> 24:36.992
I know how
to talk to people.
These blacks.

24:36.992 --> 24:39.995
Who knows what they're
gonna take the wrong way.

24:39.995 --> 24:42.998
So she's gone.

24:44.499 --> 24:47.869
Traffic and weather together
on this tuesday morning.

24:47.869 --> 24:51.122
Here's heather in the chopper.
Over here on the west side,

24:51.122 --> 24:54.626
the delay again this morning
at the inbound lincoln tunnel--

24:54.626 --> 24:58.129
about a 25- minute delay
if you're approaching it
near route 3.

24:58.129 --> 25:01.633
The queue there beginning
just before the bergen viaduct.

25:01.766 --> 25:05.770
You got your marching orders
yesterday. Why didn't you
pay the man his restitution?

25:05.770 --> 25:08.773
Restitution, okay, but
you know how much he wants,
your uncle?

25:08.773 --> 25:13.278
Fifteen dollars.
Hey, you jacked the wrong truck,
that's what happens.

25:17.148 --> 25:20.151
I didn't notice you
rushin' to give back
your fuckin' dvd player.

25:20.151 --> 25:24.906
Matter of fact, i'm enjoying it
very much. I screened
the bank dicklast night.

25:24.906 --> 25:28.293
- "Did you warble,
my little wren?"
- I'm not gonna pay it.

25:28.543 --> 25:31.162
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm serious.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.798
No, serious is what happens
if you don't pay--
by my hand.

25:34.165 --> 25:38.670
In my thoughts,
i use the technique
of positive visualization.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.172
How come
i always feel undermined?

25:41.172 --> 25:43.675
By what i did on
the triboro towers situation
alone,

25:44.175 --> 25:46.678
i should've been made,
right then-- boom.

25:46.928 --> 25:50.181
- Hmm.
- No. I'm fuckin' serious,
tony.

25:50.432 --> 25:54.069
- The books are closed.
- Did you talk to jackie
about me?

25:54.069 --> 25:57.822
They're not accepting
any new members, okay?

25:59.074 --> 26:03.078
You know, you got a reputation
for immaturity,

26:03.078 --> 26:07.082
and it's not gonna be improved
by not payin' the tributes
the acting boss demands of you.

26:07.198 --> 26:09.701
Acting boss, my ass, ton'.
Come on. Everybody knows...

26:09.701 --> 26:14.706
you really run things since
jackie became the kemo sabe.

26:14.706 --> 26:19.461
Open the fuckin' door.
Open the fuckin' door!
What the fuck?

26:28.219 --> 26:30.221
All right. All right.

26:30.221 --> 26:33.224
Fuck it. But 15 grand
is too much.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.727
I'll tell you what.

26:35.727 --> 26:40.732
You give me the 15k, i'll talk
to uncle junior personally,
and maybe i can get it to 10.

26:50.375 --> 26:53.495
One more thing.
You leave comley trucking...

26:53.495 --> 26:56.498
and every other fuckin' item
on this planet that belongs
to my uncle junior,

26:56.498 --> 26:59.000
including
his hemorrhoid doughnut,
the fuck alone.

26:59.134 --> 27:01.136
Got it?

27:01.636 --> 27:03.638
Yeah.

27:13.014 --> 27:15.517
"Did you warble,
my little wren?"

27:15.767 --> 27:19.270
What do you think
his commission'll be?
Two, three grand.

27:19.270 --> 27:22.774
Ten to junior. We're lucky,
we net 500 bucks
from the whole thing.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.790
Who is it?

27:39.174 --> 27:42.794
- What?
-

27:49.300 --> 27:52.303
mr. Arnaz?
What do you want?

27:52.303 --> 27:55.807
You seen a schoolteacher's
saturn around here?

27:58.309 --> 28:00.945
Come here! --

28:01.446 --> 28:03.948
anybody else here,
desi?

28:03.948 --> 28:07.952
Eddie, i'm ready.
Yep. Here comes lucy now.

28:08.453 --> 28:12.207
Those people
at the airport shuttle
are always late.

28:12.707 --> 28:15.710
- Eddie!
- You boys drove off with the
wrong car a couple of days ago.

28:15.710 --> 28:18.830
- Oh, my christ.
- We ain't sayin' shit until
there's an attorney present.

28:18.963 --> 28:21.466
Go ahead. Make a statement.

28:21.716 --> 28:23.718
I got fuckin' johnnie cochran
right here for you!

28:35.597 --> 28:38.099
You boys put a real crimp
in my week.

28:38.600 --> 28:42.353
Get over here. --

28:42.353 --> 28:45.356
hey, puss,
here's the fuckin' set.

28:46.858 --> 28:51.329
- Look.
- Fuckin' car's been chopped.
Fuckin' useless now.

28:51.329 --> 28:55.450
- That's not it.
- Then why is that car inside
there? See it? That dodge?

28:55.450 --> 29:00.371
Why is that motherfucker
wearin' a fuckin' plate number
i been carryin' all week?

29:00.371 --> 29:03.374
I don't know.
Let me tell ya
what's gonna happen here.

29:03.374 --> 29:07.762
The two of youse
are climbin' over that fence
and shaggin' those plates.

29:07.762 --> 29:10.765
- But the razor wire--
- then one of you stays
with us...

29:10.765 --> 29:14.769
while the other
goes out on the street
and boosts another saturn.

29:22.894 --> 29:26.397
On the lookout for ducks, dad?
Know the old man
pretty good, huh?

29:26.898 --> 29:28.399
Don't look so sad.
They were cute,

29:28.900 --> 29:31.903
but remember how pissed you were
about the pool filter?

29:32.403 --> 29:35.907
It was special,
them coming here, huh?
Don't you think?

29:35.907 --> 29:38.660
I really wasn't into it.

29:38.660 --> 29:43.164
What time's your grandma
gettin' here?

29:43.298 --> 29:46.301
She had to drive fanny
to the doctors.

29:46.801 --> 29:49.804
Then she is picking up
my mother and father,
and they're comin' here.

29:49.921 --> 29:52.924
They're each
gonna bring some antipast'.

29:52.924 --> 29:55.927
You know, i complain
about my mother all the time,

29:55.927 --> 29:59.564
about how she just sits at home
and feels sorry for herself,

30:00.064 --> 30:03.685
but she's always ready
to drive those oldster friends
of hers around,

30:03.685 --> 30:05.687
the ones that can't
drive anymore.

30:05.687 --> 30:09.190
I'm proud of her.
It gives me hope.

30:30.211 --> 30:33.214
Ooh. It's getting chilly
out here.

30:33.464 --> 30:38.603
Make plenty of noise
before you open the front door.
You never know who's in there.

30:38.970 --> 30:42.473
There's mystar ledger.
Thanks.

30:42.974 --> 30:46.978
Oh, this street.
It's another pain in the ass.

30:51.733 --> 30:56.738
She broke her wrist
on the steerin' column.
A minor concussion.

30:56.738 --> 30:59.624
What about the other woman?

31:01.125 --> 31:03.628
- Hip.
-

31:06.631 --> 31:09.634
we were down at the hospital
till 2:00 in the mornin'...

31:09.634 --> 31:12.136
talkin' to her doctor...

31:12.136 --> 31:14.639
and the staff gerontologist.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.642
They're sayin' that she
shouldn't live alone anymore.

31:20.645 --> 31:23.147
She can't
manage the telephone.

31:24.649 --> 31:27.652
And yet you say
she's very healthy and alert.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.654
Like a bull.

31:30.655 --> 31:33.157
Why?

31:33.157 --> 31:37.161
I'm just thinking. And
i know there are other doctors
who are right there,

31:37.161 --> 31:43.284
but you know from your own life
that depression
can cause accidents,

31:43.284 --> 31:45.286
poor performance or worse.

31:45.286 --> 31:49.290
So what are you sayin'?
That unconsciously she tried
to whack her best friend?

31:49.674 --> 31:53.177
It's interesting
that you would even take that
from what i said.

31:55.179 --> 31:57.181
Either way,

31:57.181 --> 32:01.185
she could need a change
in her living situation,
be around more people.

32:01.686 --> 32:04.188
Well, we were lookin'
at green grove.

32:04.188 --> 32:08.443
That's a beautiful facility.
It's more like a hotel...

32:08.443 --> 32:10.945
at cap d'antibes.

32:12.563 --> 32:17.068
Yeah, but to her
it's a nursing home.

32:17.568 --> 32:20.071
Well, she needs to be made
to see the distinction,

32:20.071 --> 32:23.074
that in fact she's embarking
on a rewarding chapter.

32:24.959 --> 32:29.580
I know seniors
who are inspired and inspiring.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.592
Ladies?

32:46.597 --> 32:49.600
Hey, we're the ones--
kenny portugal said,
"say'hello. '"

32:49.600 --> 32:52.603
Oh, yeah. Kenny.

32:54.605 --> 32:58.109
- What the fuck
is with this cocksucker?
- Back up.

32:58.609 --> 33:01.112
Back up.
Mr. Scorsese, good evening.

33:01.612 --> 33:04.115
Whoa. Wow.
Wow. Ho- ho- ho!

33:04.499 --> 33:08.503
Marty! Kundun.
I liked it.

33:17.879 --> 33:19.881
So my boy at comley...

33:20.381 --> 33:23.384
said there's a truckload
of italian suits.

33:23.885 --> 33:26.888
Those unload fast.
Mario'll take the whole load.

33:26.888 --> 33:31.392
- He said the shipment
moves thursday, 6:00 a. M.
-

33:33.394 --> 33:38.900
- give me one good reason
i should not jack this truck.
- Hey, don't feel bad.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.403
It's junior's own fault.
He gives us no choice
except to do it again.

33:42.403 --> 33:44.405
Takin' that outrageous
fuckin' tribute.

33:44.405 --> 33:48.910
Not only does he shit
on our heads, we're supposed
to say,"thanks for the hat."

33:48.910 --> 33:52.914
It's not like i'm
gettin' somewheres playin'
by the rules. Fuck tony.

33:53.414 --> 33:55.917
"The books are closed."
Blow me.

33:55.917 --> 34:00.421
No. That's some true shit.
Come on. They're not confirming
any new made guys? How come?

34:00.421 --> 34:04.058
Fucking chaos.
Nobody knows who's
runnin' things anymore.

34:04.559 --> 34:09.563
Guys, they don't even know
who to make payments
up the ladder to in some cases.

34:09.563 --> 34:12.567
I'm talkin' about the year 2000,
the millennium.

34:12.567 --> 34:15.570
Where do we go from here?

34:24.445 --> 34:28.449
Mm. Ma,
this virginia ham--

34:28.449 --> 34:32.954
- go. Go and
get yourself some more.
- No. I'm full.

34:32.954 --> 34:35.456
It's good, though.

34:35.456 --> 34:37.958
You never let me feed you.

34:40.460 --> 34:44.966
- So, gettin' back to what
we were talkin' about--
- you want that lamp?

34:44.966 --> 34:48.969
Ma, lie down.
That lamp--
that's real ormolu.

34:48.969 --> 34:53.107
- You know what that's worth
when it's new?
- We're fixed good, lamp- wise.

34:53.107 --> 34:56.476
Take it,
and take the barcalounger.

34:56.476 --> 35:00.481
Somebody's gotta take
this-- this stuff before i die.

35:00.865 --> 35:03.367
Otherwise there's gonna be
an awful lot of stuff here...

35:03.868 --> 35:07.371
that the junkman's gonna have
to cart off to the dump.

35:07.371 --> 35:12.877
Ma, you're not gonna die;
your stuff's not gonna be
hauled off to the dump.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.879
But you do have to start
plannin' for your future.

35:14.879 --> 35:18.382
You got the most rewarding
chapter of your life
comin' up.

35:18.382 --> 35:21.886
- You know my good jewelry?
- The stuff dad gave you?

35:21.886 --> 35:25.389
Yeah, some
of those pieces came right out
of cartier's window, huh?

35:25.890 --> 35:29.894
Listen.
Carm doesn't want it.
Not now.

35:30.394 --> 35:32.897
What we both want
is for you to live long...

35:32.897 --> 35:35.900
and wear your sparklers
to your grandchildren's
graduations.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.904
I gave it all
to your cousin josephine.

35:39.904 --> 35:43.274
- What the fuck?
The good jewelry?
- She always admired it.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.776
They don't have much money.

35:45.910 --> 35:49.914
You gave a fuckin' cousin
cartier dinner rings, and you
give me a vibratin' chair?

35:50.164 --> 35:54.669
Your wife
never showed any interest
in my jewels.

35:54.669 --> 35:57.672
She never complimented me
on any of it, as i can remember.

35:57.672 --> 36:00.424
You listen to me, now.
Before you do any more
serious damage...

36:00.424 --> 36:04.929
to yourself or your
grandchildren's inheritance,
you're gonna stop livin' alone.

36:05.179 --> 36:07.181
I'm not going
to that nursing home.

36:07.682 --> 36:11.686
Green grove is a
retirement community, and it's
like a hotel at cap d'antibes.

36:11.936 --> 36:15.306
- Who's he?
- A captain who owns
luxury hotels or somethin'.

36:15.306 --> 36:19.443
I don't know. That's
not the point. The point
is i talked to mrs. Dicaprio.

36:19.944 --> 36:23.948
She's got a corner suite
available with a woods view.
It's gonna go fast.

36:24.065 --> 36:26.067
Of course it's available.
Somebody died.

36:26.567 --> 36:29.070
Oh, ma, you gotta stop!
You gotta stop with this--

36:29.070 --> 36:32.707
this black- poison cloud
all the time, 'cause i can't
take it anymore!

36:33.207 --> 36:35.209
Ohh, poor you!

36:35.209 --> 36:38.212
You know,
i got problems at work.
I got problems at home.

36:38.212 --> 36:40.715
I got a friend
who's been diagnosed
with cancer.

36:40.715 --> 36:44.218
Most parents would be grateful
if their yuppie children put as
much thought into this as i did.

36:44.218 --> 36:47.722
- I'm not going to that place.
- Then i will go to court,

36:47.722 --> 36:50.725
and i will get a durable power
of attorney over you
and i will place you there.

36:50.975 --> 36:54.478
Then kill me now.
Go on. Go.
Go into the ham...

36:54.478 --> 36:58.482
and take the carving knife
and stab me here.

36:58.482 --> 37:00.985
Here. Now. Please!

37:00.985 --> 37:03.487
It would hurt me less
than what you just said.

37:03.988 --> 37:07.858
- You know, i know seniors
that are inspired!
-

37:15.866 --> 37:19.870
yo, monty, we said
we'd meet out front.
You're not even dressed.

37:19.870 --> 37:23.007
- I'm takin' a pass.
- What?

37:23.374 --> 37:26.377
It's italian suits,
christopher.

37:26.377 --> 37:30.381
There was a time in my life when
bein' with the tony soprano crew
was all i ever dreamed of.

37:30.881 --> 37:33.017
So what am i doing?

37:33.017 --> 37:36.637
- This is some fuckin' note.
- Shh. Don't wake her up.

37:37.138 --> 37:39.140
Come on. It's 5:15.

37:39.140 --> 37:43.644
Maybe one reason why things are
so fucked up in the organization
these days...

37:43.644 --> 37:47.648
is guys runnin' off,
not listenin'
to middle management.

37:48.149 --> 37:53.154
- Fuck tony.
That's a quote.
- We have to stick together.

37:53.154 --> 37:57.658
Why be in a crew?
Why be a gangster?

37:57.658 --> 38:00.661
Hey, coach, suck my dick.

38:00.661 --> 38:02.663
Yeah.

38:16.927 --> 38:20.681
Yo! Hey, yo!
We need some help over here.

38:23.684 --> 38:27.688
Okay, let's be very cool, yo.
Get down out of the cab!

38:27.688 --> 38:30.191
You heard the motherfucker!
Hurry up!

38:30.191 --> 38:33.194
Yo, chill.
I'm a friend of billy's,
your friend on the inside?

38:33.194 --> 38:36.697
Yeah? Cool. No probs here.
Increase the peace:
That's our motto.

38:36.831 --> 38:40.835
I'm gonna
take my lunch, okay?
Whatever. Come on.

38:45.339 --> 38:48.342
Hold up, man.
You can't drive a fisher- price.

38:52.213 --> 38:55.216
What's with the gun
pointed sideways shit?

39:02.223 --> 39:04.225
Get out! Come on!
Get down!

39:04.225 --> 39:07.228
You drive.
I'll direct you.

39:09.363 --> 39:11.982
- Jesus! -

39:12.116 --> 39:14.618
control your shit,
fool!

39:17.238 --> 39:20.241
Fuck. Oh, fuck!
Fuck!

39:22.243 --> 39:24.245
Fuck!

39:25.746 --> 39:29.250
Fuck! Junior fuckin' soprano's
gonna go ape- shit! Fuck!

39:31.385 --> 39:34.388
You excited about comin'
to live with us, hon?

39:35.890 --> 39:38.642
You will be. Trust me.

39:39.143 --> 39:42.012
Oh, look, ma!
Here's your stuff.

39:42.012 --> 39:45.516
They made good time.
Yeah.

39:45.516 --> 39:49.520
You got your own bed
and your dresser.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.157
You know,
when my grandmother went
to live...elsewhere,

39:53.157 --> 39:56.660
they weren't allowed
to bring personal effects.

40:00.664 --> 40:04.418
Ma, you gotta
sign right here.

40:11.425 --> 40:15.930
Yes?

40:16.297 --> 40:20.684
- Mr. Soprano,
do you have an uncle junior?
- He tracked me down here?

40:20.935 --> 40:23.437
Line two?
Here you go.

40:23.437 --> 40:26.440
Tell him i'll call him back.
He'll return the call.

40:26.440 --> 40:31.195
He did?
Apparently, it's urgent.
She said he sounded upset.

40:31.695 --> 40:34.198
He'll call back.

40:37.201 --> 40:40.704
Livia, did you ever
hear the old italian saying--

40:40.704 --> 40:44.208
my aunt used to go:

40:50.714 --> 40:53.717
- What does that mean, bonnie?
- Time and patience...

40:53.717 --> 40:57.721
change the mulberry leaf
to silk.

41:10.985 --> 41:13.487
You be all right?

41:13.487 --> 41:17.491
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks for all your help.

41:18.993 --> 41:21.495
I'm gonna
make us a nice lunch.

41:21.495 --> 41:23.998
I got some fantastic
prosciut' in there.

41:27.001 --> 41:31.005
Hello? Yep.
It's christopher.

41:31.121 --> 41:33.123
Yeah?

41:33.624 --> 41:36.510
Christ. I been callin'
for hours. Give me a call back
on an outside line.

41:49.890 --> 41:52.893
T, don't get mad.

41:52.893 --> 41:55.145
There's been a little shit.
I had nothin' to do with it,
just so you--

41:55.145 --> 41:59.033
spit it out.
Brendan hit comley again.

41:59.033 --> 42:01.285
He what?

42:02.286 --> 42:05.289
And, uh, the driver,
you know--

42:05.289 --> 42:11.295
no, i don't know.
He caught some friendly fire
or something, and he's gone.

42:12.913 --> 42:16.050
Oh, fuck.
What do we do, t?
Brendan didn't fence the load,

42:16.550 --> 42:19.670
'cause now he's thinkin'
maybe it was mario who dimed us
to junior last time.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.672
Fuck!

42:39.573 --> 42:43.577
Hey, ton'. Sorry you have to
wreck your saturday like this.

42:46.830 --> 42:50.334
You boys.
You boys, i'll tell ya.

42:53.203 --> 42:56.707
It's beautiful stuff,
though.
Ton', i'm so sorry.

42:56.707 --> 43:00.210
Shut up.
Just so long as you realize
i had nothing to do with this.

43:00.210 --> 43:03.714
Ton', that's true.
He stood home.
Shut up.

43:03.714 --> 43:06.216
You stood home?

43:07.718 --> 43:11.221
Did you do anything to stop it?
Did you offer any guidance?

43:12.723 --> 43:15.225
What do we mean when
we say "leadership"? Hmm?

43:15.225 --> 43:19.730
Ton', part of it's the crank,
but i'm goin' into detox,
swear on my mother.

43:19.730 --> 43:23.233
Brendan, shut the fuck up.
You wanna get me clipped?

43:26.737 --> 43:29.740
- What are we gonna do?
- What you're gonna do is
you're gonna take these suits,

43:29.740 --> 43:33.243
put'em back in the truck,
go over to comley's main yard
and give'em back.

43:33.627 --> 43:35.996
- Aw, fuck.
- And then you're gonna
call my uncle,

43:35.996 --> 43:38.382
and you're gonna tell'im
when it's done.

43:38.382 --> 43:42.136
- What about the dead guy?
- You keep proddin' him
with a stick.

43:42.136 --> 43:46.006
You light a candle
to st. Anthony. But
i think you're fucked.

43:48.759 --> 43:54.648
Ton', what if this
didn't go back?
Would it be a problem?

43:58.152 --> 44:00.654
You know,
i don't see you assholes
puttin' that rack...

44:00.654 --> 44:03.774
and that rack and this rack here
back in the truck.

44:12.416 --> 44:16.420
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

44:18.288 --> 44:21.792
Hey, mr. Miller,
your car is back.

44:21.792 --> 44:25.796
My wife dropped me off
this morning, and there it was.
It was in my parking spot.

44:26.296 --> 44:30.300
My uncle pussy
helped my dad locate it.
Your uncle pussy?

44:30.300 --> 44:32.803
Yeah. He's
in the car business.

44:32.803 --> 44:36.807
Well, i don't know what to say
to your dad. I mean, thanks,
of course.

44:36.807 --> 44:38.809
It's nice and clean too.

44:39.309 --> 44:41.195
Whoa. Different keys.

44:41.695 --> 44:45.199
Probably too much
to hope my papers are still
inside the trunk here.

44:46.950 --> 44:49.953
It's a different color.
- Whoa.

44:49.953 --> 44:52.956
Ooh.

44:53.457 --> 44:55.959
My dad's a hero.
Mm- hmm.

45:55.636 --> 45:59.139
Did you actually
lose consciousness,
like with the ducks?

45:59.389 --> 46:01.391
No.

46:01.892 --> 46:07.397
Just, uh, a shortness of breath
and white spots
in my field of vision.

46:07.397 --> 46:11.401
- Improvement.
- 'Cause i'm sad
to put my mother away?

46:11.401 --> 46:14.905
Sad is good.
Unconscious isn't.

46:16.406 --> 46:20.410
She'll be in very good hands.
You've done the best for her.

46:21.411 --> 46:23.914
She won't speak to me.

46:25.415 --> 46:28.418
That is sad,
but whose choice is that?

46:28.418 --> 46:31.421
Somehow,
that doesn't make it any better.

46:31.421 --> 46:35.926
Can you admit to yourself
that, yes, you're sad,

46:36.426 --> 46:39.429
but you're very angry
and full of rage?

46:39.429 --> 46:42.933
- I'm sad.
- It's hard to admit that...

46:42.933 --> 46:46.937
you might have feelings of
hatred towards your own mother,
isn't it?
