Christmas was always special.

    that money could buy.

  We made our own toys.         
  We used to exchange things.   

00:47.148 --> 00:49.081

   into the forest with daddy   

00:49.083 --> 00:51.350
    To cut down a tree          
    which was always great.

    - Sneaky.

'cause i knew if i asked        
for those paints and she said no

       What's she doing?        

30:58.491 --> 31:00.858
How do you cheat                
on a writing test?              

31:00.860 --> 31:03.360
               Miss parton,     
               front and center.

31:04.497 --> 31:06.463
What did i do?                  

31:06.465 --> 31:10.100
          Not you,              
          sweet stella mae. You.

31:10.102 --> 31:13.604
 Since you were so interested in
 talking during your essay test 

31:13.606 --> 31:16.406
        You can be the first one
        to read yours aloud.    

31:18.377 --> 31:20.077
             Alright, now, dolly

31:20.079 --> 31:23.080
       Please tell us who your  
       favorite famous person is

31:23.082 --> 31:25.249
        And why you admire them?

31:25.251 --> 31:27.985
  Why, that's easy, miss moody. 

31:27.987 --> 31:32.456
 It's miss dolly parton, rising 
 star of the grand ole opry.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.592
    She was born                
    on a cold winter's night    

31:35.594 --> 31:37.561
  In locust ridge, tennessee.   

31:37.563 --> 31:39.296
She was singing                 
before she could talk.          

31:39.298 --> 31:43.000
 Doc thomas swore she came out  
 screaming in the key of "e."   

31:43.002 --> 31:45.269
          Yeah, i bet.          

31:45.271 --> 31:48.972
  Hey, this is my paper,        
  and i can write what i want.  

31:48.974 --> 31:50.908
You compelled me, miss moody    

31:50.910 --> 31:52.943
But i get to say my piece,      
don't i?                        

31:52.945 --> 31:58.015
   Tell me more about this star,
   miss dolly parton.           

31:58.017 --> 32:02.119
Well, i.. She was always        
writin' about music             

32:02.121 --> 32:03.587
Not just her people, no         

32:03.589 --> 32:07.024
       But by the very mountains
       themselves.              

32:07.026 --> 32:08.625
What do you mean by that?       

32:08.627 --> 32:13.463
I mean, ever since i was a baby,
i always heard it.              

32:13.465 --> 32:17.501
 The music, mountains make music
 that sound like angels singin' 

32:17.503 --> 32:21.471
'or devils fightin', depending  
on the weather and their mood.' 

32:21.473 --> 32:25.175
   She's had a heavenly choir   
   in her ever since.           

32:25.177 --> 32:27.511
       And then miss moody      
       wrote on my paper        

32:27.513 --> 32:31.248
  "miss dolly parton, i think   
  you got some potent tales     

32:31.250 --> 32:33.183
    For expressing yourself     
    in writin'."                

32:33.185 --> 32:34.484
           [chuckles]           

32:34.486 --> 32:37.821
 And what exactly do you think  
 she means by that?             

32:37.823 --> 32:40.591
    - I have no idea.           
    - I think that was good.    

32:40.593 --> 32:43.393
I think she meant potential.    

32:43.395 --> 32:46.330
Dolly has potential as a writer.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.665
        High praise coming      
        from miss talulah moody.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.200
           She's a college girl,
           you know?            

32:50.202 --> 32:51.802
She's the smartest woman i know.

32:51.804 --> 32:52.903
                     Since when?

32:52.905 --> 32:54.538
     Since she's seen my talent.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.806
Here, dolly, try this on, baby. 

32:55.808 --> 32:58.075
I need to see                   
if it's long enough.            

32:58.077 --> 33:01.812
     Miss moody told me         
     to keep working on my paper

33:01.814 --> 33:04.481
         And read it            
         to the class next week.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.416
      Can you have my coat      
      done by then, mama?       

33:06.418 --> 33:08.118
        I gotta wear it         
        for my readin'.         

33:09.588 --> 33:15.092
 Well, i'm gonna need something 
 extra special for the lining.  

33:15.094 --> 33:17.561
           I brought this       
           for your coat, dolly.

33:17.563 --> 33:18.662

33:18.664 --> 33:20.564
 - Oh!                          
 - It's from my wedding dress.  

33:21.433 --> 33:24.268
Oh, thank you, aunt estelle.    

33:24.270 --> 33:26.803
     - It matches my eyes.      
     - I know.

 'i got some old dirty drawers  
 you could have, dolly.'        

33:29.275 --> 33:31.909
Nice color brown that matches   
the dirt behind your ears.      

33:31.911 --> 33:33.477
  <i> (dolly)</i>

33:35.214 --> 33:37.447

33:54.432 --> 33:58.602
Mama, tell us a story of joseph 
and those mean brothers again.  

33:58.604 --> 34:01.538
        Okay, well now..        

34:01.540 --> 34:05.776
  Joseph was a beautiful boy.   

34:05.778 --> 34:11.181
  'so loved by his father       
  and even more loved by god.'  

34:11.183 --> 34:14.885
 But his 12 older brothers      
 didn't like him always talking 

34:14.887 --> 34:18.355
   About his dreams             
   of them kowtowing to him.    

34:18.357 --> 34:21.491
    Yeah, so, they dug a hole so
    deep that they couldn't hear

34:21.493 --> 34:23.760
  'his bragging and his yapping,
  and they threw him in.'       

34:23.762 --> 34:26.596
Yeah, but they ended up         
bowing down to him all the same.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.431
      Didn't they, denver?      

34:28.434 --> 34:30.967
 He might've started out in a   
 hole, but he ended up a king.  

34:30.969 --> 34:34.670
  So joseph saved his people.   

34:34.672 --> 34:37.908
     And from those people      
     came jesus.                

34:37.909 --> 34:40.944
      And he saved us all.      

34:44.350 --> 34:47.284
  Alright, i think it is done.  

34:47.286 --> 34:48.518
Try it on, let's see if it fits.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.687
    - Help her, willadeene.     
    - 'okay, you ready?'        

34:50.688 --> 34:52.456
            - Go on.            
            - Okay.             

34:54.460 --> 34:56.393
                           Okay.

Mama, what's wrong?             

35:46.578 --> 35:49.513
       I had a dream last night.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.826
It looks like she slipped in it.

   - No, it doesn't.            
   - It looks right as rain.

- Everybody, get in the fields. 
- No, no, no, we can't, daddy.

     So this is your fancy coat?

37:49.801 --> 37:52.235
 - Bunch of rags sewn together. 
 - Rudy, stop it.               

37:52.237 --> 37:55.071
 My mama made this coat for me  
 with her own hands             

37:55.073 --> 37:58.608
  And it's beautiful,           
  like joseph wore in the bible.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.444
   - And he was royal.          
   - Yeah, you're royal too.    

38:01.446 --> 38:04.181
 A royal fool, might as well    
 wear garbage and call it gold. 

38:04.183 --> 38:07.684
            Rudy, that's enough.
            I'm ashamed of you. 

38:07.686 --> 38:09.052
  Come on, darlin'. Let's go.   

38:10.022 --> 38:12.122

     Go on in.                  
     Now stay out a minute.     

38:16.295 --> 38:18.728
Alright, dolly, we're just      
gonna get that coat right off-- 

38:18.730 --> 38:21.097
  I'm keeping it on, miss moody.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.067
It will be less distracting     

38:24.069 --> 38:27.304
If we just put it               
in the closet for now.          

38:27.306 --> 38:31.441
   Believe me, miss moody,      
   it'd be more distracting off.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.078
           I don't have anything
           on underneath.       

38:36.748 --> 38:40.817
You are not wearing             
a shirt or anything             

38:40.819 --> 38:42.519
Underneath your coat?           

38:42.521 --> 38:46.656
         My only shirt was dirty
         and so is my dress.    

38:46.658 --> 38:50.026
      I never planned on        
      takin' off my coat...Ever.

Lord, that young'un will put    
anything in his mouth.          

39:54.660 --> 39:57.861
   Well, i reckon a hornworm's  
   better for him than the dirt.

 fallin' out or somethin'?      

40:10.208 --> 40:13.009
Me and lee don't have a problem.

      Well, they get to fightin'
      and then--                

40:23.055 --> 40:26.256
We didn't have a fight.         
We had a death.                 

40:26.258 --> 40:30.327
I love you, daddy, but you don't
know beans about me and lee.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.266

40:36.268 --> 40:41.204
  But now, too much time,       
  that can, that can make some..

40:42.741 --> 40:44.674
         ...Dangerous territory.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.676
          And the devil will get
          in there              

40:46.678 --> 40:49.746
        And he will start sowing
        seeds of doubt          

40:49.748 --> 40:52.048
         And before you know it,
         that marriage is broke.

40:55.654 --> 40:56.920
You think lee's

41:01.560 --> 41:04.094
I don't know.                   

41:04.096 --> 41:06.396
After the baby died,            
i pushed him away.              

41:08.567 --> 41:11.034
He just ain't found             
his way back yet.               

41:11.036 --> 41:13.503
             Well, then you need
             to shine a light.  

41:15.540 --> 41:18.808
      You need to help that boy.
      He ain't like us, honey.  

41:20.612 --> 41:22.579
          He don't have the lord
          to follow.            

41:22.581 --> 41:25.048
           You're about as close
           to that as he gets.  

41:28.620 --> 41:32.856
              And that can be   
              a tough road home.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.557

       if it's true.

            After all the things
            i said and done..   

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:32.481
  ...How can you stand me, mama?

01:02:32.483 --> 01:02:35.584
 How can you stand              
 and look at such a little worm?

01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:40.322
Because you're my worm.         

01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:45.027
You're like a little pupa.      

01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:48.730
Just developing                 
its protective shell.           

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:52.634
And your cocoon,                
that's your family.             

01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:56.171
Wrappin' around you so tight.   

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:58.573
And when you                    
finally break free..            

01:02:58.575 --> 01:03:02.110
...You'll have                  
beautiful butterfly wings..     

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.847
...With beautiful colors..      

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:07.883
...That will catch the wind     

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:11.887
And the eyes of everybody       
that see 'em.                   

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:15.424
And those colors,               
they've always been in there    

01:03:15.426 --> 01:03:17.993
Just too tiny to see            

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:20.696
Until the time is just right.   

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:25.600
    But...How will i know, mama?

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:28.437
Because..                       

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:31.707
...You'll be able to fly.       

01:03:34.445 --> 01:03:36.445
                          Mama..

01:03:38.082 --> 01:03:41.216
   ...Why are those sanders kids
   at school so mean?           

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:45.587
           Are they just jealous
           and full of hate?    

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:48.423
I think that's what happens     
when love is missin'.           

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:51.226
They just go sour.              

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:55.263
Like milk, sitting out          
too long in the sun.            

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:58.734
      That bunch don't even give
      love to each other.       

01:03:58.736 --> 01:04:02.204
I ain't talking about           
the love they give, baby.       

01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:04.272
I'm talking about               
the love they get.              

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:08.410
             But...How do i love
             rudy sanders?      

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:09.878
By forgivin' him.               

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.215
We're called                    
to love our enemies.            

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:17.919
See, love, it ain't             
just a feeling. It's an action. 

01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:22.457
You decide to forgive him       
and that is an act of love.     

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:25.761
                Have you decided
               to forgive daddy?

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:30.966
There ain't nothing             
to forgive.                     

01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:34.236
I love your daddy now           
and forever.

If you don't remember anything  
else from the bible, darling    

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:39.007
Remember this.

  and his coat of many colors.

  'let me through. Make way.'

 Now, i understand, you bedding 
 down out here in the barn

reach for me

   like you and the preacher say
