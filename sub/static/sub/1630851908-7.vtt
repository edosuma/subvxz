00:13.431 --> 00:15.975
- Babe.

00:16.016 --> 00:19.311
What are you doing?
Hey!

00:19.353 --> 00:21.689
- Look at you guys rolling
in on skateboards.

00:21.731 --> 00:23.315
- You two look
like little skater bros....

00:23.315 --> 00:26.235
- Little skater chicks,
matching and all.
- So in love.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.446
- Like your pants.
- What's up?

00:28.487 --> 00:30.698
- I like your sunglasses
better than mine though?

00:30.740 --> 00:32.867
- Want to wear them?
- Sure.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.034
Where'd you get these at?

00:34.076 --> 00:35.411
- Amanda's.
- My closet.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.079
- Oh, really?
- Amanda's closet.

00:37.121 --> 00:38.748
- Amanda's got the swag...
- Store coming soon.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.374
- Our closet.
- Our closet. Sorry.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.001
- Yeah, you guys need to
build up a cute little

00:42.042 --> 00:43.544
closet like Haley did.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.296
- She's got her own rack
already on the shelf.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.338
- That's so cool, I love that.

[laughter]

00:47.548 --> 00:48.799
- Damn, that's pretty serious.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.259
You just set yourself up on
that one.

00:50.301 --> 00:51.552
Does she have a
toothbrush in your house too?

00:51.594 --> 00:53.846
- Two of them.
- Oh, shit.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.973
- You guys are so
cute, I love that.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.349
- You guys are so cute.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.059
- Ever since I met
Amanda, I feel like

00:59.101 --> 01:01.020
things are getting a lot
better. I'm not going to lie.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.522
I was getting in kind of a
dark place before I met her.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.357
She's definitely
pulled me out of that.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.318
We went and put
resumes out together

01:07.359 --> 01:10.029
and I end up getting
a job, so that's good.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.572
- So, I heard you
had a court date.

01:11.614 --> 01:13.240
- Yeah.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.992
- How did that go?
- They really didn't do much.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.577
It just was like a,
what's it called?

01:16.619 --> 01:18.037
- Arraignment.
- Arraignment, yeah.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.830
So I just have to go back
I think in June.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.499
Everything seems like
it's gonna be okay.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.917
It's just the money
aspect of it.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.168
- Getting it all
sorted out, yeah.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.628
- ...because
I got a new job now,

01:25.669 --> 01:26.629
so I'm going to be
making good money.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.297
- Oh, really? Sick.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.423
- But since I didn't work
for like a little bit,

01:29.465 --> 01:30.800
that kind of put me behind.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.176
- I get that.
That's cool though.

01:32.218 --> 01:33.427
At least you found a new place.

01:33.469 --> 01:34.804
Is it somewhere
like super popular?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.347
- It's Crafty squirrel.
- Oh yeah.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.848
- It's just the fact
that I had to train

01:37.890 --> 01:39.517
for like a whole
week and didn't get any tips

01:39.558 --> 01:40.684
and like they were making
like a crazy amount of money

01:40.726 --> 01:42.353
and I wasn't getting any tips.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.395
- With all that shit building
up it could be a lot,

01:43.437 --> 01:44.980
I can imagine.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.857
- I need to get my finances
figured out for my DUI.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.651
I'm really good at
budgeting and saving money,

01:48.692 --> 01:52.029
but I don't really know what
my budget is going to be yet

01:52.071 --> 01:54.532
because I haven't got
all the details of how

01:54.573 --> 01:56.700
much I'm going to have
to spend for the DUI.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.786
- Think I wrecked my fucking
jeep pretty bad.

01:58.828 --> 01:59.870
Yeah, they told
me you did,

01:59.912 --> 02:01.413
they told me it's not drivable.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.624
- It's giving me a
little bit of stress,

02:03.666 --> 02:06.877
worrying about like,
what's to come.

02:06.919 --> 02:08.337
- I mean, I can help you out,
like cover it

02:08.379 --> 02:10.005
for the time being and
then you could just like

02:10.047 --> 02:11.882
pay me back whenever you
get back on your feet and shit.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.133
- You know I'm not gonna
take money from you.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.593
- I know you always
say that but...

02:14.635 --> 02:15.719
- I'm not going to
take money from you.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.221
- It's not a huge deal, like,

02:17.263 --> 02:18.889
I know you'll pay me
back eventually...

02:18.931 --> 02:20.391
- I know. but I don't want to...

02:20.432 --> 02:21.976
- It's not going to
hurt me to help you.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.519
- I know, but I just don't
feel good about it.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.312
Because then I would
stress that I'm like behind

02:25.354 --> 02:26.939
and I owe
somebody something.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.065
- It wouldn't bother me

02:28.148 --> 02:29.525
I'm not in a rush to get
it back.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.360
- It just stresses me out.
- I get that.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.404
I feel like Olivia
probably feels

02:33.445 --> 02:34.822
bad because she's
usually the one

02:34.864 --> 02:35.990
taking care of everybody else,

02:36.031 --> 02:37.700
buying everybody
dinner and shots

02:37.741 --> 02:39.869
and all that stuff so I think
it's a big deal for her

02:39.910 --> 02:43.080
to be accepting
help from somebody else.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.665
You know, I got a bunch of
shit that I need done

02:44.707 --> 02:45.916
in my house that
I've been wanting

02:45.958 --> 02:47.293
to pay somebody to do too.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.335
- Like what?

02:48.377 --> 02:49.628
- That's always a thing.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.088
[Haley]: Like our fucking
windows.

02:51.130 --> 02:52.339
[laughter]

02:52.381 --> 02:54.758
- Come wash those windows girl.
- Naked.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.886
- I don't know.
I can wash windows.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.262
I'm good at washing windows.

02:58.304 --> 03:01.140
- Do you want to go
jump in the water?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.349

03:22.661 --> 03:24.079

ones of these are going

03:24.121 --> 03:26.040
to be easy to take
care of for us?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.333
- Well, I like green...

03:27.374 --> 03:28.334
- Because you're a
plant murderer.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.668
- Shh!

03:29.710 --> 03:32.171
- I'm going to
try to be better.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.715
When you pick one, we better
just... I don't know.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.258
I'm going to call
my dad or something.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.593
- Yeah, but now we have...
It's easier to water

03:37.635 --> 03:39.219
the plants and
everything babe.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.013
Speaking of your parents,
when are they coming?

03:41.055 --> 03:42.848
- You're really asking me that?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.642
- Well, I mean, what's the
estimated time of arrival...

03:44.683 --> 03:45.726
- As if I know?

03:45.768 --> 03:47.269
My family has finally confirmed

03:47.311 --> 03:49.146
that they're
going come see us soon.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.857
I think that my dad really
wants to just fish out back.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.442
So the fact that
we're no longer in

03:53.484 --> 03:56.195
an apartment makes
them want to come even more.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.488
- We finally moved in.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.073
We're done.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.367
I don't like hi-fives
but I'll give it to you.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.702
I've spent a decent
amount of time with

04:03.744 --> 04:05.955
Summer's family because when
we first started dating,

04:05.996 --> 04:08.082
I mean, we were in a long
distance relationship.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.583
Anytime we were
visiting each other,

04:09.625 --> 04:12.169
it was usually very
family involved.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.379
- I know you don't
want much color,

04:13.420 --> 04:14.880
but I think that's like...

04:14.922 --> 04:16.423
- I want bougainvilleas.
- Those are pink.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.592
- I don't care.
- Of course you like it.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.511
It's called the Desert Rose.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.137
- Ow!
- What's that supposed to mean?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.263
- That's your name, isn't it?

04:23.305 --> 04:24.932
- No.
- Native American name.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.058
- Actually...
- Desert Flower.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.434
- Okay, you're lucky.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.894
- I always wanted
to say Desert Rose.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.145
- No, it's Desert Flower.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.438
I'm Native American.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.650
My mom is all
about the culture.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.694
She gets really excited
to talk about it.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.446
We were given Native
American names at birth.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.407
Mine is Desert Flower,

04:41.448 --> 04:42.866
my mom's is Morning Star,

04:42.908 --> 04:44.410
it's on the back of my neck and

04:44.451 --> 04:46.412
my brother's is Golden Eagle.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.997
We were raised thinking
we were Cherokees,

04:48.038 --> 04:49.707
so I learned so much
about the Cherokee and

04:49.748 --> 04:51.000
then when my nanny
was passing away,

04:51.041 --> 04:52.793
she was on her death bed

04:52.835 --> 04:54.795
and told my mom
we're actually Sioux.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.505
But we had to say we
were Cherokee because

04:56.547 --> 04:58.382
the Sioux had a hard
time getting jobs.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.967
- Oh, interesting.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.678
- I told her to bring
the Native American trunk

05:02.720 --> 05:04.263
so you can see the
outfits and stuff.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.265
- I'm excited, I
like that stuff.
- Mhm.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.810
I love Summer, more
than anything in this world,

05:09.852 --> 05:12.354
so anything that I
can learn more about her

05:12.396 --> 05:14.982
is always a blessing.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.775
It's like a cherry on top

05:16.817 --> 05:18.861
when the family that
you're gonna get involved with

05:18.902 --> 05:20.821
and the family that you're going
to accept as your own

05:20.863 --> 05:23.032
is just as excited
about their culture

05:23.073 --> 05:25.159
as yours is about their own,

05:25.200 --> 05:27.619
because I think that that's
a really beautiful thing that

05:27.661 --> 05:29.997
they can learn from each
other and exchange stories

05:30.039 --> 05:31.749
and exchange customs.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.750
I just remembered
we have your car,

05:32.791 --> 05:34.126
we need to get the truck.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.502
So we'll buy this one
and then we can

05:35.544 --> 05:36.628
come back and get
the other one later.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.213
- Okay.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.631
- Or when your dad gets here...
- What are these things?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.091
This looks like it could be
poisonous if you touch it.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.926
- It looks like a caterpillar.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.553
- It just makes you want to
touch it, but you shouldn't.

05:44.595 --> 05:45.929
- I'd rather know.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.890
- Okay. We'll come back.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.059

like plan out things.

as to who I invited

Your bitch slimy.

your Pride outfits yet?

- The stripper store.

- What's the stripper store?

outfits and like vibrators

06:31.600 --> 06:33.352

like a sex store.

- I went to Cirilla's on Dale
Mabry, it's the best one.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.189

- Same thing.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.483
Pride is a really
important day for me.

06:39.525 --> 06:42.778
It's a time for the

07:27.281 --> 07:29.408
I don't feel like walking
the parade this year

07:29.449 --> 07:33.871
so I'm thinking about
renting a float.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.707
I talked to the right person
when I was drunk, day drinking.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.083
- She's got connections,
you know.

07:38.125 --> 07:42.379
- 35'. We measured it in
human bodies today at the
gym.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.630
- [laughs]
- It's very spacious.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.840
- We literally
were laying down.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.092
I laid down and then she laid
down and then I laid down.

07:47.134 --> 07:52.639
I would really like to call
our float, floats and hoes.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.975
So like us and then like the
rest of the baes,

07:55.017 --> 07:58.228
Nelly, Ali, Marissa,
Summer, Mack, and Jordan.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.980
Pride is huge.

08:00.022 --> 08:03.400
We did not have a
Pride last year due to COVID

08:03.442 --> 08:06.695
and this is literally
the kickoff to Pride season.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.488
Tampa is it right now.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.450
- Have you asked Summer
and Marissa about coming?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.161
- Yeah, no they're down.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.372
We're not going to have any
drama on the float, right?

08:17.414 --> 08:19.666
- Not from me.
- [Olivia]: I will kill you all.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.585
I don't think Summer,
Marissa and Brianna

08:21.627 --> 08:23.629
and Haley are ever going to
be braiding each other's hair.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.464
Hopefully, they can eventually
tolerate each other enough

08:25.505 --> 08:28.550
to be in the same room without
a big cat fight happening.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.427
I know that the rest
of us are pretty tight

08:30.469 --> 08:32.804
and hang out and
get along easily.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.223
It's just when you
put those two couples

08:34.264 --> 08:36.058
together is when
we get problems.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.476
- It'll be big enough
so everybody

08:37.517 --> 08:38.644
will have like their own space.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.437
- I will jump off the float.
- I'm exhausted.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.481
I will have my titanic moment

08:42.522 --> 08:45.067
into the crowd and
jump off the float.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.693
- When you're friends with
everybody, you kind of like

08:46.735 --> 08:48.904
want to do all
the things together,

08:48.946 --> 08:50.656

going out and trying

08:50.697 --> 08:53.075

go get a drink?

Bye, y'all....

08:55.410 --> 08:57.955
Back off!

08:57.996 --> 08:59.665
- No, I want everybody
to go fuck themselves.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.042
- I didn't insult Sarah,
we just talked about it.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.503

me because you will regret it.

Pride without any drama.

Nobody.

like environmentally friendly?

going to be launching beads

I'm not scared to say it.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.170
I was trying to hide it
with my hat,

16:02.212 --> 16:03.963
but I definitely
cried a little bit.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.261
I'm fine.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.846
Stop it.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.015
- I'm trying
so hard to not cry.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.728
- Is that the, um...

16:18.770 --> 16:20.772
- You better leave her alone.
- Don't acknowledge it.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.399
- We are one and the same.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.404
I was going to say maybe
we should go check on her,

16:27.445 --> 16:29.948
but right now you just look like
your grandmother in a costume

16:29.989 --> 16:31.866
so I don't think
it's going to help.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.786
- Seeing my mom get
emotional is really rare.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.454
None of us really
show our emotions

16:36.496 --> 16:38.540
in the family and
I'm sure it's not healthy,

16:38.581 --> 16:39.916
but that's just the way we are.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.668
You don't let people
see you down.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.795
You keep moving because
even if you are down,

16:43.837 --> 16:46.297
it's not going to
change what's happened.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.258
[Brian]: Time doesn't
heal some things.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.512
- You got it?

16:52.554 --> 16:53.555
- Yeah, I'll show
you the pictures.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.475
Here's my grandfather.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.060
See with the buffalo?
Because our last name

16:59.102 --> 17:01.521
was Buffalo and that's my uncle

17:01.563 --> 17:03.106
and he's doing
the medicine dance.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.816
- Is this like for a show?

17:04.858 --> 17:06.401
- It's called a pow wow.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.862
- No, but I mean, was this like
a real one, or was it...

17:08.903 --> 17:10.238
- What do you mean?
- Was the guy actually dying?

17:10.280 --> 17:13.116
- No, damn!

17:13.158 --> 17:15.577
- Did the guy need medicine?
- Oh my God!

17:15.618 --> 17:18.580
- One of the reasons why my
nanny was so special to me

17:18.621 --> 17:20.123
is because she was doing so
many things

17:20.165 --> 17:22.542
to make the Native American
community visible

17:22.584 --> 17:24.753
and there weren't a lot of
other women that

17:24.794 --> 17:27.130
were willing to do
that, especially back then.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.841
So as somebody that's part
of the LGBTQ community

17:29.883 --> 17:31.134
and Native American,

17:31.176 --> 17:33.303
I hope to
continue her legacy.

17:36.139 --> 17:39.559
- Hello, hello.
- Oh, hello.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.561
- Oh my gosh.
Wow, what are we doing?

17:41.603 --> 17:43.062
Are we doing a
skit or something?

17:43.104 --> 17:44.355
- No.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.232
Kaleigh is my ride or die.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.485
Kaleigh is my best friend,
she's my support system

17:48.526 --> 17:50.695
and we've been
friends since I was 14

17:50.737 --> 17:52.489
in high school
in Jacksonville.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.865
She's seen it all.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.575
She's been there
through my coming out.

17:55.617 --> 17:58.620
She's the only person
that's stuck by my side

17:58.661 --> 18:00.497
so I'm really excited
to have her around

18:00.538 --> 18:02.916
and have my shoulder to lean on.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.585
This is nice.
I would really like a tour.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.795
Oh, yeah.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.506
- Oh. Have you
never been inside?

18:09.547 --> 18:11.007
When we came here,

18:11.049 --> 18:12.383
you didn't have the
key or something,

18:12.425 --> 18:14.803
- so I only saw the outside.
- Oh, yeah.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.471
- And then we creeped through
the windows like we did when we
lived here.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.347
- Have you seen
the kitchen yet?

18:17.388 --> 18:18.348
- No, I haven't seen anything.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.266
♪♪

18:24.103 --> 18:26.773
- You need a drink.
- I want a sangria.

18:26.815 --> 18:30.318
- Awesome, thanks so much.
- Thanks. Thank you.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.987
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Hello, hello.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.740

18:35.782 --> 18:36.950
What are you guys doing here?

18:36.991 --> 18:38.201

- What's up, how are you?

18:38.243 --> 18:40.036
- Hi.
- You guys look wonderful.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.538
Already got
your fruity drinks?

18:41.579 --> 18:43.331
- You look wonderful.
- Hi. Long time no see.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.916
- Oh my God,
you look wonderful.

18:44.958 --> 18:49.087
My dad lives nearby and he is
just pure entertainment

18:49.128 --> 18:51.464
every time he's around
and a little annoying.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.508
Hi guys.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.260
He thinks he's a jokester,

18:55.301 --> 18:57.136
but he doesn't know that
I'm actually the jokester.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.180
- Whenever things don't
go her way she just growls.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.723
- I don't have to growl,

19:00.765 --> 19:02.559
I just calculate, and like
control the situation.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.102
- Now it's at the point
where I'm the dad

19:04.143 --> 19:07.146
and she just looks at me
and I'm like, oh, okay.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.357
- It's time for you to behave.
- I'll be good.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.234
He's a wildcard, really.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.527
Like you really never know what
you're going to get from him.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.111
Yeah.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.071
- It's nice of you
to quarterback for me.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.322
- Yeah.
- I love when you take
care of me.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.408
When she's not in charge.

19:18.449 --> 19:19.701
- She's always in charge.

19:19.742 --> 19:20.994
- The general over here.
- The general.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.579
The general.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.164
Brianna's dad calls
Brianna "the general"

19:25.206 --> 19:27.542
and has actually called
her that since growing up.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.545
I think a lot of people see
Brianna's tough exterior

19:30.587 --> 19:34.674
and her like straight eyebrows
and her piercing glare.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.885
I just feel like a lot of
people misunderstand her

19:36.926 --> 19:39.596
because she looks very
tough on the exterior.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.973
- By the time she
was three years old...

19:42.015 --> 19:42.974
- She thought she
was in charge.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.726
- She already was in charge

19:44.767 --> 19:46.895
and she had a very
serious face about it

19:46.936 --> 19:48.396
and we would go into
supermarkets

19:48.438 --> 19:49.898
and older women would say,

19:49.939 --> 19:52.191
"My God, your children
are so behaved."

19:52.233 --> 19:54.277
And then this one would
be three years old

19:54.319 --> 19:57.697
and she would tell the old
ladies in the supermarket,

19:57.739 --> 19:59.782
"Don't talk to my brothers."

19:59.824 --> 20:01.409
- No, it was,
"Don't bother my brothers..."

20:01.451 --> 20:02.785
- "Don't talk to my brothers."

20:02.827 --> 20:04.787
She would grit her teeth,
like a dog.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.414
She was protective
even as like a baby.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.458
Yes, at three
or four years old,

20:08.499 --> 20:10.919
she was already like a man
that could run a country.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.378
I was already a man at three.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.256
She was already
a powerful general.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.467
- When I first met
Brianna I was like,

20:17.508 --> 20:19.385
Oh my God, this girl's crazy.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.888
I didn't really understand
her personality too well

20:21.930 --> 20:24.933
because she's very tough
on the exterior

20:24.974 --> 20:27.602
and a little
bit moody sometimes.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.062
I'm just very emotional
and I used to cry

20:29.103 --> 20:32.273
if she even snapped
or anything like that.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.233
I met heard dad one
Thanksgiving

20:34.275 --> 20:36.277
and he literally just
threw a plate over

20:36.319 --> 20:39.030
his shoulder at the
restaurant and yelled, Opa.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.200
Everything just like made
sense at that point.

20:42.241 --> 20:46.829
That's who she
was raised from, so...

20:46.871 --> 20:48.581
I think he gets nervous
around me

20:48.623 --> 20:50.541
because I'm the only one
who's gonna say something to him

20:50.583 --> 20:52.085
if he is doing something
that is out of line.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.545
My little general
straightening out the dad.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.464
- Beast, calm.
- Beast mode.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.132
Calm. Calm, beast.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.509
A lot of my friends

20:59.550 --> 21:00.510
meet me and whatever
they talk to me, they go

21:00.551 --> 21:02.637
"Oh you're a fucking crazy
bastard. I know who you are."

21:02.679 --> 21:04.472
And then when I tell them well,

21:04.514 --> 21:07.433
"If you had time to
spend in this world,"

21:07.475 --> 21:09.852
I say, "I would spend my
time with my four children."

21:09.894 --> 21:11.062
There's nobody more
magnificent than them.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.188
- Yeah.
- And that's got...

21:12.230 --> 21:13.940
- Oh and you, you're
included.
- Thank you.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.984
- All your papers are
going to be signed Monday.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.944
- Yes, yes.
- I'm adopting Haley officially.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.153
- Adopting.
- We're adopting.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.197
- That would make them
sisters then.

21:21.239 --> 21:24.117
- That's okay, Haley Murphy,
it's okay. It's not a big deal.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.660
- That can be done.
- It's America.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.787
[Zach]: That can be done by
my marriage as well.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.707
- No, no, no marriage
...listen,

21:30.748 --> 21:33.001
when I got married in 1985,
that's what people did.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.086
Nowadays, I don't condone it.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.713
I don't think it's necessary.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.923
I think that people
just living together

21:38.965 --> 21:40.591
in unity if they really
love each other,

21:40.633 --> 21:42.468
why they need a piece of
paper that's going to bring

21:42.510 --> 21:45.013
a lot of people financially
into their lives.

21:45.054 --> 21:49.767
Well, I want that eventually,
I'm not gonna lie.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.602
So I don't believe in
pressuring anybody

21:51.644 --> 21:54.814
to get married or have kids,
so whenever she's ready.

21:54.856 --> 21:56.607
But I did tell her
that it has to

21:56.649 --> 21:58.234
happen within three
years because

21:58.276 --> 22:00.653
then we'd be together
for nine years.

22:00.695 --> 22:03.031
That'd be crazy.
And not get married? Come on.

22:03.072 --> 22:06.784
But just going to have
to keep waiting.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
- Oh, fuck. Here comes
the cops, everybody duck.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.246
- Get under the table.
- Shut up.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.664

- Come on hold, on a second.

They've come such a
long way from the past.

22:39.984 --> 22:40.943
It's sad that we have such
a good relationship

22:40.985 --> 22:42.737
now that I'm far away

I talk to her every single day
that I'm on the way to work,

22:48.076 --> 22:51.245
lunch break and on the
way home, I talk to her.

22:51.287 --> 22:56.417
- I mean, I wonder if they ever
think back to those times

22:56.459 --> 22:58.419
and everything that happened.

22:58.461 --> 22:59.921

we don't talk about anything,

everything is just
brushed under the rug.

23:04.509 --> 23:07.804
Sweep it under the rug
and move on in life.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.014
I met my ex when I was 16

23:10.056 --> 23:13.101
and throughout our
entire on and off,

23:13.142 --> 23:14.727
over nine-year relationship,

23:14.769 --> 23:19.148
it was accepting, we hate you,
accepting, we hate you.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.608
I think that's why
we'll probably

23:20.650 --> 23:24.987
never talk about our history,
and because,

23:25.029 --> 23:27.240
it's like do I want
closure and answers

23:27.281 --> 23:28.658
and to know that
she's fully accepted me?

23:28.699 --> 23:32.370
Yeah, but is it
worth opening that?

23:32.411 --> 23:34.163
I don't know if
you'll ever get that.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.957
I don't think I'm ever
going to get that.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.501
I don't, but...

23:40.002 --> 23:42.213
[Producer]: You don't want
to talk about that?

23:42.255 --> 23:43.256
No.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.554
You okay?

23:49.595 --> 23:50.972
You're okay.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.014
- I can't.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.938
Um...

23:58.980 --> 24:00.398
I've always
loved my parents so much,

24:00.439 --> 24:02.859
I think that I was very
blessed to have them.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.902
They're such good people

24:04.944 --> 24:06.445
and I think that's what
broke my heart so much

24:06.487 --> 24:11.200
is that something so small
changed everything.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.411
It sucked
that me being gay

24:13.452 --> 24:15.163
had to change
what we had

24:15.204 --> 24:20.459
and that I feel like I lost
years of my life as a teenager.

24:20.501 --> 24:24.547
I was basically
locked in my room,

24:24.589 --> 24:26.632
stupid fucking church,

24:26.674 --> 24:27.717
trying to take
the lesbian out of me.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.385
Like, I can't talk about it.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.223
I also don't want people
to look at them

24:34.265 --> 24:35.474
like they're bad people.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.018
Because I think that
even though

24:37.059 --> 24:38.477
I've never gotten a
true sorry from them,

24:38.519 --> 24:41.022
I think that how
present they are now

24:41.063 --> 24:43.733
is their apology in a sense.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.026
And I don't want them to see...

24:45.067 --> 24:46.360
Sometimes I hide
how hurt I am because

24:46.402 --> 24:48.404
I don't want them
to feel guilty.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.373
- This is only ever
been the problem.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.375
- It's so sad to call it
the problem because...

25:01.417 --> 25:02.835

- It's you being happy

25:02.877 --> 25:04.295

- Yeah.

- I feel bad for all the young

25:06.088 --> 25:07.965

that.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.759

went through it now

25:09.800 --> 25:11.135

try to come out

25:15.640 --> 25:17.099

just got your car,
have all your friends.

25:18.768 --> 25:19.977

with your parents

25:20.019 --> 25:21.562
and they make the rules.

25:21.604 --> 25:22.813
- Forced to live with
your parents, they pay for

25:22.855 --> 25:23.814
everything, they can
take your phone,

25:23.856 --> 25:25.358
they can take your car.

it's really hard.

my family come around

25:28.945 --> 25:31.489

I'm grateful that they have.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.532
I feel really good
about the future.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.494

I've put the negative to rest.

it here, still have you.

- Still be gay.
- I cant even...

25:44.543 --> 25:46.003
I thought for a long time
that I was just going

25:46.045 --> 25:47.546
to end up marrying
a man so that I had

25:47.588 --> 25:50.549
a relationship with my mom
and to just be sad.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.635

25:52.677 --> 25:54.262

you've treated us the best.

comes back over here,

26:03.229 --> 26:05.022

really important to her,

26:07.566 --> 26:10.111

hand in marriage.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.029

I just wanted to...

26:12.071 --> 26:13.197

please get rid of her.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.204

26:20.246 --> 26:21.872

anyways

been ready for it.

loved me like a daughter.
