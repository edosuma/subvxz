08:37.808 --> 08:38.392
Yeah.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.270
Things could've went better.

08:42.104 --> 08:42.939
In what way?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.861
I wonder if maybe
we started you off too soon.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.697
Weren't there to give you
the proper coaching.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.450
Really, it's myself I blame. Not you.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.537
If you let me try again

08:57.870 --> 09:01.457
I swear to you I will be so good.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.543
Oh I know you would, Max. I know.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.753
It's not my decision.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.590
Please. I love this job so much.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.177
You have other passions?

09:14.595 --> 09:15.471
This is it.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.932
You must have other interests?

09:19.100 --> 09:21.477
I thought about
going into politics once, but...

09:23.187 --> 09:24.480
this seemed more effective.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.357
But this effectiveness,

09:27.024 --> 09:28.234
it just isn't there,

09:29.235 --> 09:31.779
at least not to the satisfaction
of our friends back East.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.489
Can I talk to them?

09:33.489 --> 09:34.532
[chuckles]

09:34.574 --> 09:38.077
Come on, this is one slip.
I've been effective.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.204
I took out Jimmy Cowhide.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.998
Jimmy was a quadriplegic.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.670
Frankly, these have been,
as our friends would put it...

09:48.963 --> 09:50.548
...dumb moves.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.011
And it's nothing against you, Max,
it's just business.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.722
Business is cold.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.686

Thank you for choosing
TEA Employment Agency.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.622
And how may I help you, today?

11:06.207 --> 11:07.083
I need a job.

11:07.124 --> 11:07.917
Awesome!

11:08.376 --> 11:10.461
And have you used our services before?

11:11.712 --> 11:12.380
No.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.340
Then may I please ask you to sign this.

11:14.757 --> 11:18.135
It's a release form relinquishing
our agency's responsibility

11:18.135 --> 11:20.846

11:20.846 --> 11:23.891

13:36.565 --> 13:38.234
Well, are you here for employment?

13:38.567 --> 13:41.153
Or, are you just part of the wallpaper!?

13:46.992 --> 13:47.785
Alright, then.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.288
Given your experience in the military

13:51.372 --> 13:54.333
and brief tenure
as a law enforcement officer

13:54.917 --> 13:56.877
and especially given
your numerous charges

13:56.877 --> 13:58.838
of excessive force and brutality,

13:59.421 --> 14:02.800
it is our opinion that the field of
education is your calling.

14:03.759 --> 14:04.760
In particular,

14:04.760 --> 14:08.681
the area dedicated to molding
the minds of our prepubescent youth.

14:09.431 --> 14:13.352
Currently, the only opening in
said field is custodial services.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.897
You will report to
JP Melville Elementary School,

14:17.064 --> 14:20.442
1800 Washington Street at 0700 hours

14:20.860 --> 14:22.361
and meet with a Principal Warta

14:22.361 --> 14:24.405
who will make
the necessary introductions.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.075
It is our hope that this initiatory job
will acquaint you with the rhythms

14:28.075 --> 14:30.870
and requirements
of the scholastic enterprise.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.878
How are you finding us so far?

15:22.463 --> 15:23.339
Nice place.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.341
Clean.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.012
You've not worked in education before?

15:30.721 --> 15:32.056
No, they told me it wasn't-

15:32.097 --> 15:33.432
Quite alright. Quite alright.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.772
Do you find you like children?

15:40.814 --> 15:43.150
I've never really given 'em much thought,
to be honest.

15:49.073 --> 15:49.865
Well...

15:50.240 --> 15:53.327
Well, they say we are really
doing the Lord's work here.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.412
And I can understand that.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.248
I mean being here
each day for nine hours.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.625
You...

16:00.084 --> 16:01.085
...children...

16:01.627 --> 16:02.920
Children are the future you know.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.589
And who could argue with that?
Who would? Right?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.384
But they will hold that against you.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.052
They will.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.262
They will use it.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.015
I pray they don't crush you, too.

16:16.392 --> 16:16.976

But is this real?

17:20.080 --> 17:22.624
There are some days
when I suspect all the light

17:22.624 --> 17:24.334
in this world has gone dark.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.546
Today may be one of those days.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.719
I trust you can find your way
to your office?

17:34.928 --> 17:36.055
Is everything okay?

17:36.930 --> 17:38.599
Otto Percy's parents are here.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.684
Eh- they want to dispute his grade.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.311
It was an A...

17:43.145 --> 17:44.188
...minus.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.776
Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

I just want to say that I hope
in these few days since we last spoke

18:40.244 --> 18:43.372
that you're dealing positively
with the extra time that I'm...

18:44.206 --> 18:46.083
...that I'm sure you find yourself with.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.086
Please touch base with us
when you can.

And then he has the audacity

20:04.661 --> 20:09.082
to insist that the payments made to
my mother's estate are...invalid.

I mean I can't believe
I even know someone like that.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.423
Furthermore, I- well...

20:17.007 --> 20:19.635
probably shouldn't say this
but I often times find myself

Ohh, I know, Ms. Partridge,
I'm sorry.

It's just-...it's-...frustrating.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.065
How much would you pay
for something like that?

20:37.194 --> 20:38.153
Excuse me?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.952
How much would you pay
for something like that?

See this fellow
removed from the equation?

20:50.874 --> 20:52.251

I couldn't put a dollar-

'bout a hundred thousand.

as going too slow, okay?

We can take all the time we need.
Does that sound okay to you?

22:13.373 --> 22:15.250
Do you want to start with this word?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.128
No? You don't?

22:18.378 --> 22:20.714
Are you sure?
Cause I think you can.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.424
You wanna give it a try?

22:24.384 --> 22:25.052
Yeah?

how're you gonna kill me?

23:41.169 --> 23:42.045
I don't know yet.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.256
Are you gonna cut my throat?

23:44.923 --> 23:48.176
Or are you gonna chop off all my fingers
so there's no way to identify me?

23:48.802 --> 23:50.262
Or are you just gonna shoot me?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.556
What's the difference?

23:53.140 --> 23:54.307
I guess there isn't any.

I live with my dad.

Just so you know,
I wouldn't mind if you just

24:10.532 --> 24:11.366

Why would you say that?

I don't think you're supposed
to say things like that.

25:17.849 --> 25:18.558
didn't they?

25:21.937 --> 25:22.771
Can I do that?

25:29.819 --> 25:31.279
You have to be

25:32.072 --> 25:34.699
the very best of the best.

25:36.910 --> 25:37.786
I can do that.

25:38.954 --> 25:39.704
So,

25:39.746 --> 25:42.749
what kinda competition do you have?

25:43.542 --> 25:46.461
-Competition?
-Who else does what you do around here?

25:47.837 --> 25:48.547
No one.

25:50.423 --> 25:53.009
You know what, no one can do what I do

25:53.593 --> 25:56.638
and they don't even appreciate it,
can you believe that?

25:59.432 --> 26:01.601
Sooo, anyways.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.396
Don't you need some marketing,
or something?

26:05.230 --> 26:08.066
The government's foreign policy
always takes care of that one.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.029
What are you getting out of this,
anyway?

That means I missed my bus.

LUCY:
Just to make this clear,

26:28.003 --> 26:29.588
you don't have to walk me home.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.215
But, because you're an employee
of the school,

26:32.382 --> 26:34.926
you could be held liable if
anything did happen to me,

26:35.510 --> 26:37.178
since you did see me last.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.389
MAX:
Is that a threat?

26:40.056 --> 26:41.182
LUCY:
It's just how it is.

26:41.808 --> 26:42.809
MAX:
Uh-huh.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.103
LUCY:
Good.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.481
-MAX: Well, Lucy is it?
-LUCY: That's right.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.275
MAX:
Let's make something else clear.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.653
I said I didn't think I was gonna kill you.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.364
I can think a lotta different things.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.658
LUCY:
That's what I assumed.

26:58.992 --> 26:59.576
MAX:
Good.

27:00.368 --> 27:00.994

Now, then...

27:01.202 --> 27:02.454
LUCY:
How 'bout a proposition?

27:14.633 --> 27:15.342
Well?

27:16.885 --> 27:17.594
What do you got?

27:18.011 --> 27:19.929
Well, I could talk.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.308
And what would you talk about?

27:23.600 --> 27:25.060
What you're about.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.147
And that is?

27:31.691 --> 27:32.275
Well?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.277
What if I want you to do something?

27:35.070 --> 27:36.071
And you won't talk?

27:36.196 --> 27:37.822
If that's how it works.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.283
Well, that depends upon
what you want me to do

27:40.283 --> 27:42.911
and how that stacks up
against me not wanting you to talk.

27:43.536 --> 27:44.871
I know someone who needs to go.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.164
On a trip.

27:46.247 --> 27:47.499
No. Go.

27:48.958 --> 27:49.918
A target, huh?

27:51.920 --> 27:52.545
Who is it?

27:53.004 --> 27:54.130
Ruby McCallister.

27:55.006 --> 27:55.840
What's she to you?

27:56.007 --> 27:56.758
A terror.

27:57.133 --> 28:00.220
Sometimes I don't even want to wake up
because I know I have to see her at school.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.598
She says the meanest things.
I hate her.

28:04.933 --> 28:05.850
Where does she live?

28:06.476 --> 28:07.185
I don't know.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.062
Do you got a picture of her?

28:09.479 --> 28:10.397
I could get you one.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.400
Yeah. Do that.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.611
So does this square us up?

28:18.363 --> 28:19.447
I don't know.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.784
This is a loud target. High profile.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.536
Lots of emotions.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.831
I appreciate the vow of silence, but...

28:28.498 --> 28:29.916
I could stand to eat a little more.

28:30.291 --> 28:31.126
8,000.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.754
But I won't get my allowance
'til the end of the week.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.635
-You said 8,000, as in $8,000-
-Three zeroes. Four weeks' allowance.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.514
-Your daddy does what?-
-So that's a deal?

28:59.779 --> 29:02.323
So, how far is it to your daddy's house?

29:02.407 --> 29:05.368
I can find my way home from here, but,
thank you, Mr. Bishop!

Thank you for another great day.

(guitar fades out)

30:15.605 --> 30:17.857
LUCY:
So...when can you do this for me?

30:19.025 --> 30:21.611
MAX: The first thing you need to know
is that this stuff takes time.

30:22.445 --> 30:23.446
MAX:
Right now...

30:24.948 --> 30:25.698
I don't know when.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.243
I need to see how this kid operates.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.870
Thanks for doing this for me, Max.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.540
You're paying. It's all fair.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.542
My dad, he wants to talk to you.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.918
He said there'll be appetizers.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.169
What's that?

30:38.419 --> 30:40.338
My dad, he wants to talk to you.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.049
-Why?
-About the thing. He likes the idea.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.426
-What now?-We shouldn't be late.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.095
And your daddy does what?

30:49.889 --> 30:52.225
MAN: I appreciate you coming here today.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.727
Coming when called upon,

30:55.353 --> 30:58.189
there's implied respect, I thank you.

30:59.315 --> 31:03.319
But, I'm sure you can appreciate
my interest in inviting you.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.489
With monetary negotiations underway,

31:07.365 --> 31:09.576
my experience and line of work,

31:10.451 --> 31:12.120
I felt it was necessary.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.207
MAX:
Well...you know, sir, I-...

31:16.624 --> 31:17.375
[Max clears throat]

31:20.295 --> 31:23.172
...I'm trained in this field and
when your daughter approached me,

31:23.172 --> 31:25.300
naturally I was inclined to have interest.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.219
Kneejerk reaction.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.515
There was no intent
to offend or startle you.

31:33.516 --> 31:34.642
Mr. Bishop,

31:35.101 --> 31:36.936
you shouldn't misunderstand.

31:37.186 --> 31:41.024
It is not in my interest to have
my family name defiled.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.486
Little Lucy, here, is telling me
just that is taking place.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.947
Some things

31:49.073 --> 31:51.743
I need to take time to think about

31:52.535 --> 31:54.871
and some things I do not.

31:55.914 --> 31:56.789
This...

31:57.040 --> 31:58.708
I do not.

31:59.792 --> 32:00.543
No.

32:00.960 --> 32:05.006
I am here to see that both sides
are adequately taken care of,

32:05.590 --> 32:08.635
to ensure a clean and successful outcome.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.137
That's all anyone wants.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.431
Clean. Successful.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.394
What was Lucy's offer to you, Max?

32:21.105 --> 32:22.273
MAX:
Uhhh...

32:23.691 --> 32:25.151
...let me think here.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.071
LUCY:
8,000.

32:30.156 --> 32:33.493
Now, that will certainly get you
a body in the ground.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.204
But, will it get you security?

32:37.205 --> 32:38.331
Lucy, honey,

32:38.665 --> 32:40.458
will it get you security?

32:42.710 --> 32:44.504
What do you think, Max?

32:46.214 --> 32:48.841
Well, the thing of it is, Mr. Sergio,

32:50.009 --> 32:54.555
factored into that quote was the idea
that Lucy would not, uhh,

32:55.264 --> 32:59.727
share certain information about me
with certain individuals,

32:59.769 --> 33:00.853
i.e....

33:03.189 --> 33:04.190
anyone.

33:04.691 --> 33:05.858
Max...

33:06.484 --> 33:08.152
As if little Lucy's head

33:08.194 --> 33:11.739
would not be the recipient of a
Mr. Bishop 9mm,

33:12.115 --> 33:15.743
if you got a hint that she got
near so much as a string telephone.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.246
What I want to know is...

33:18.705 --> 33:20.540
what's with the clearance aisle estimate?

33:20.581 --> 33:21.624
I'm out of work at the moment...

33:21.624 --> 33:22.417
You're washed up!?

33:22.625 --> 33:23.668
You could say I'm on leave.

33:23.668 --> 33:24.502
What did you mess up!?

33:24.585 --> 33:26.170
I have an accomplished resume.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.880
I want to hear it.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.467
Listen to what I'm concerned about,
Lucy.

33:31.968 --> 33:36.055
There is no honor
amongst an $8,000 dollar crowd.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.766
Say the worst were to happen,

33:39.267 --> 33:41.352
our friend Max gets into trouble,

33:42.145 --> 33:43.479
put into time out...

33:44.022 --> 33:48.151
Would a member of the $8,000 crowd

33:48.860 --> 33:50.361
have the honor

33:50.820 --> 33:52.238
and the incentive

33:52.655 --> 33:53.865
to remain quiet?

33:55.825 --> 33:56.951
I wonder.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.328
But,

33:59.787 --> 34:02.248
say a member of the

34:02.457 --> 34:05.460
$100,000 crowd...

34:06.586 --> 34:10.339
I suspect that man
would have the incentive.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.550
Beyond that,

34:12.967 --> 34:14.385
I think that crowd

34:14.844 --> 34:16.554
would be able to help us

34:16.554 --> 34:20.016
avoid the whole scenario altogether.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.225
Hm?

34:22.101 --> 34:24.270
[grandfather clock ticking]

34:27.857 --> 34:30.276
It's okay if you can't do this stuff,
Max.

34:32.862 --> 34:33.863
It's okay, Lucy.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.784
How long have you all lived here?

34:38.367 --> 34:39.494
Six months.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.955
And not afraid to jump in the deep end
right off the bat?

34:43.956 --> 34:46.667
Some things require thinking
and some things do not?

34:47.710 --> 34:49.087
Wouldn't be to your mind that those

34:49.087 --> 34:51.589
"thinkin' scenarios" take place more out East?

34:52.507 --> 34:53.257
Hm?

34:53.841 --> 34:54.592
I mean,

34:54.759 --> 34:58.387
here you are walking around like
we're in a city of cops stretched thin.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.848
Around here,
you take a leak in the woods

35:00.848 --> 35:04.060
and you will have a dozen bored pigs
on you like a feed pen.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.145
You are not back home.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.523
You cannot put on a show here.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.317
A bullet to the head
with something like this?

35:12.276 --> 35:13.194
It's an option.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.238
But maybe...

35:17.907 --> 35:19.492
maybe you need to get creative.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.161
Consequently, you need patience,

35:22.787 --> 35:24.372
you do need diligence

35:25.039 --> 35:26.958
and you will need work ethic.

How bad is this kid hurting us?

42:04.146 --> 42:06.774
STRANGER: I want you to do nothin'.
That's all.

42:07.816 --> 42:09.693
Whatever you were gonna do for Sergio...

42:10.027 --> 42:10.736
don't.

42:11.654 --> 42:12.446
MAX:
No?

42:13.113 --> 42:13.948
STRANGER:
Yeah,

42:14.490 --> 42:15.282
Sergio,

42:15.866 --> 42:17.117
East Coast guy.

42:17.618 --> 42:18.536
He's big,

42:19.328 --> 42:20.329
he's fast,

42:21.789 --> 42:23.082
maybe he's too fast.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.169
MAX:
And what do I tell him?

42:27.962 --> 42:29.755
STRANGER:
Tell him business intervened.

42:30.172 --> 42:31.715
MAX:
Lots of money at stake here.

42:33.175 --> 42:34.927
MAX:
There's a lot at stake for me.

42:35.135 --> 42:36.595
STRANGER:
I can respect that.

42:37.012 --> 42:40.307
MAX: Then I'm sure you can respect
my obligations to my client.

42:41.308 --> 42:42.309
Obligations.

42:43.477 --> 42:44.520
Commitments.

42:46.105 --> 42:47.565
Those are important things.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.067
STRANGER:
How does 500,000 sound?

42:50.067 --> 42:51.068
MAX:
Done!

42:56.240 --> 42:57.700
Good day to you, sir.

42:59.201 --> 43:00.369
Vaya con dios.

43:02.371 --> 43:03.622
What's the girl to you?

43:08.502 --> 43:09.920
I have my reasons.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.716
Maybe she don't deserve it.

43:16.218 --> 43:17.136
Who knows?

44:06.226 --> 44:07.728
[cell phone rings]

44:21.283 --> 44:21.992
Yes.

44:22.868 --> 44:23.744
MAN:
You don't know me.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.705
And you won't know me. But I know you.

44:27.247 --> 44:28.832
And I know someone talked to you.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.751
Cowboy hat, right?

44:31.460 --> 44:32.670
I know that chump.

44:33.128 --> 44:35.047
Listen to me. Kill the kid.

44:36.048 --> 44:38.133
-That so?-Yeah. That's so.

44:39.843 --> 44:43.013
You can denigrate a man
for his choice in wardrobe all you want

44:43.013 --> 44:45.808
but that doesn't change the fact
that he showed his face.

44:47.142 --> 44:49.019
You have not. Claimed you won't.

44:50.187 --> 44:50.896
Why?

44:51.105 --> 44:54.692
Because, man, I don't like it.
Any of it. [chuckle]

44:54.733 --> 44:55.901
I'm like you.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.528
Clean. Efficient.

44:59.154 --> 44:59.988
I wonder.

45:02.324 --> 45:03.659
How much do you want this?

45:04.785 --> 45:06.537
How much did Shane want it?

45:06.662 --> 45:07.955
How much do you think he did?

45:08.664 --> 45:10.374
Well...you tell me.

45:12.251 --> 45:12.835
Hm?

45:14.169 --> 45:15.629
175,000.

45:18.549 --> 45:19.133
Hello?

45:20.718 --> 45:22.261
-I'm here.-Did ya hear me?

45:23.804 --> 45:24.388
Yeah.

45:25.139 --> 45:25.806
And?

45:27.433 --> 45:29.518
I asked you how much
you thought he wanted it,

45:29.518 --> 45:31.603
not what you pay for toothpaste.

45:32.980 --> 45:34.857
Fine. 200,000.

45:36.942 --> 45:39.695
Are you trying to tell me it's more?
Is that what this is?

45:39.820 --> 45:41.405
Okay. 220,000.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.448
Is that good?

45:43.866 --> 45:45.617
How 'bout 225,000?

45:46.952 --> 45:48.412
230,000.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.038
Huh?

45:52.583 --> 45:53.959
I'm not at liberty to say.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.002
Jesus.

45:56.462 --> 45:58.589
235,000.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.132
How 'bout that, huh?

46:01.341 --> 46:03.343
No. 240,000?

46:03.677 --> 46:05.304
245,000-

46:05.387 --> 46:07.931
Jesus Christ, will you just
tell me what it is?

46:08.015 --> 46:10.851
Is it- it's not 250,000, I know that.

46:11.101 --> 46:12.686
Is it 250,000?

46:12.853 --> 46:14.897
Okay. Okay, fine. There it is.

46:15.063 --> 46:16.315
250,000.

46:16.398 --> 46:18.901
I said it. It is yours.
I'm walkin' away.

46:19.026 --> 46:21.111
250,000. Are we good now?

46:22.321 --> 46:24.698
What!? It's more than 250,000!?
[groans] Oh my God- okay.

46:26.450 --> 46:29.578
275. 275,000.

46:29.620 --> 46:32.331
Two hundred
and seventy five THOUSAND!

46:32.456 --> 46:33.582
Okay, 'that it?

46:33.916 --> 46:35.876
Don't you dare
tell me that it's more!

46:35.959 --> 46:36.627
Do not.

46:36.668 --> 46:40.756
Don't you dare tell me
it's more than 275...

46:40.923 --> 46:43.217
Say nothing if it's more than 275.

46:43.425 --> 46:44.551
Say nothing if it's more!

46:47.304 --> 46:49.056
Sir...I can't say.

46:49.264 --> 46:50.474
[painful grunt]

46:50.641 --> 46:52.017
What is it with you!?

46:53.310 --> 46:55.229
What do you need to tell me?

46:55.604 --> 46:57.147
What do you need?

46:59.817 --> 47:01.652
500,000.

47:02.027 --> 47:05.239
[painful sigh]
That sly cowboy.

[chuckle]

47:07.032 --> 47:07.950
[sigh]

47:08.492 --> 47:11.912
I apologize, Mr. Bishop.
Please, forgive me.

47:12.830 --> 47:13.455
Now...

47:13.747 --> 47:19.086
you can count on 750,000
from us, if you see it through.

47:22.172 --> 47:23.215
It'll be done soon.

47:24.675 --> 47:28.387
Then I'll be calling you.
Again. Soon. [hangs up]

48:08.385 --> 48:10.596
(methodic guitar fades out)

48:16.602 --> 48:17.519
Okay to join you?

48:19.563 --> 48:20.147
Sure.

48:21.815 --> 48:22.900
How are you getting along?

48:25.235 --> 48:25.819
Fine.

48:26.528 --> 48:30.407
Oh, good! Good! Oh, I hate this!

48:31.283 --> 48:32.743
Ohh!
[aggressive groan]

48:33.285 --> 48:35.120
I have to talk to you
about something.

48:35.996 --> 48:37.623
I really don't want to.

48:39.249 --> 48:40.792
But, it's something I've been hearing.

48:41.710 --> 48:42.878
It involves you.

48:44.046 --> 48:44.588
I-...

48:46.048 --> 48:47.049
I apologize.

48:52.262 --> 48:52.846
What?

48:57.100 --> 48:58.018
Mr. Bishop...

48:59.478 --> 49:01.855
have any of your colleagues
been engaging in...

49:06.026 --> 49:08.153
sexual activity in the workplace?

49:14.242 --> 49:15.410
Uhhh...

49:18.872 --> 49:19.748
Mr. Bishop...

49:21.291 --> 49:24.086
You know, I used to be involved
in what you might call

49:24.628 --> 49:25.796
"street activity."

49:28.048 --> 49:29.633
I know what it means to, uhh...

49:31.051 --> 49:31.802
"snitch."

49:35.013 --> 49:36.348
I think you can do this.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.991
[children entering the cafeteria]

49:57.077 --> 49:57.995
Don't move.

49:59.329 --> 50:01.289
Don't make a sound.

Are you here to play with me?

51:50.690 --> 51:51.441
MAX:
No.

51:52.484 --> 51:53.235
MAX:
I'm sorry.

51:54.736 --> 51:56.571
MAX:
Sorry for bothering you like this.

51:58.657 --> 52:00.826
That's okay. I figured not.

52:02.077 --> 52:04.204
No one ever really wants to play with me.

52:04.996 --> 52:06.414
You probably don't know, but...

52:06.623 --> 52:08.542
sometimes I shout out things
that I don't mean.

52:09.209 --> 52:10.210
I can't control it.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.588
I think it makes people
not wanna be around me.

52:14.297 --> 52:14.965
I get it.

52:15.674 --> 52:16.633
'Sucks, though.

Now I'm gonna go...back up that hill.

52:41.950 --> 52:43.368
Please don't watch me, it's...

52:44.536 --> 52:45.829
...it's gonna be a hard climb.

53:13.857 --> 53:19.446
Things will be cleanly wrapped up
in a short period of time

53:19.446 --> 53:26.453
and I will speak with you
in person as soon as it is appropriate.

53:26.953 --> 53:30.290
Pass along my best to your dad.

53:31.249 --> 53:38.632

a clean and successful investment.

Very sincerely yours,

P.S.

53:49.476 --> 53:50.268
Lucy,

53:51.186 --> 53:54.731
Ruby may have a disorder
known as Tourette syndrome.

53:55.315 --> 53:58.526
This may account for why
she says upsetting things.

53:59.569 --> 54:01.112
I hope this is helpful.

54:12.415 --> 54:14.626
[birds chirping outside]

54:19.381 --> 54:20.715
You've been keeping busy.

54:22.842 --> 54:25.595
I see you took my advice...
about finding something new.

54:26.596 --> 54:27.389
School.

54:28.181 --> 54:30.767
That's you.
I have no problem seeing it.

54:31.768 --> 54:34.980
Seems though you found
some extracurricular activities.

54:36.064 --> 54:39.609
It's come to our attention
that you have a new phone friend.

54:40.610 --> 54:43.738
He talks like the world owes him a favor.

54:44.281 --> 54:46.408
Asked that you follow through on a target.

54:47.409 --> 54:48.576
He's a friend of a friend.

54:49.536 --> 54:50.620
Not anymore.

54:50.870 --> 54:51.746
SAL: Hm. No.

54:52.539 --> 54:53.915
Not anymore.

54:54.874 --> 54:56.584
He stepped outta line here.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.921
That's why we need you
to step down on this one.

55:00.964 --> 55:04.592
As you know, it's no joy of ours
to tell people their business.

55:05.593 --> 55:07.470
But in this case, as it happens,

55:07.762 --> 55:10.724
our business interests have intersected.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.185
Needless to say, our mutual acquaitence

55:14.185 --> 55:17.480
needs to be disappointed in this situation.

55:19.816 --> 55:21.818
You don't want me to take out my target.

55:22.610 --> 55:24.362
Unfortunately, no.

55:27.866 --> 55:28.992
I got a job to do.

55:29.826 --> 55:31.453
And we'll contract you, as it were.

55:31.828 --> 55:33.580
Compensate you for your losses.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.041
It is our understanding that our friend

55:36.041 --> 55:38.960
offered you 750,000.

55:40.170 --> 55:43.423
We'd like to offer you 1,000,000
to go your own way on this.

55:44.758 --> 55:45.675
That's, uhh...

55:47.510 --> 55:49.012
that's very generous of you.

55:50.722 --> 55:52.807
What he probably didn't tell you
is that this...

55:54.184 --> 55:56.394
this contract, uhh...

55:58.480 --> 56:01.024
there's a lot of components here.

56:01.816 --> 56:03.026
It's a worthy offer.

56:03.651 --> 56:06.863
But it doesn't take into account the
100,000 coming my way

56:06.863 --> 56:08.323
from my original client.

56:12.577 --> 56:14.120
If I bend on this...

56:15.830 --> 56:17.165
am I back on their payroll?

56:18.291 --> 56:20.085
That's not how this is going to work.

56:20.627 --> 56:21.711
What's going to happen

56:21.920 --> 56:24.589
is that you are going to sign
a proclomation

56:24.923 --> 56:30.678
declaring that you won't partake
in any for-profit one eight sevens.

56:31.429 --> 56:32.931
Not as a free agent.

56:33.181 --> 56:36.017
Not as an organizational employee.

56:36.559 --> 56:37.769
Excuse me?

56:38.561 --> 56:40.146
We are your friends, Max.

56:40.939 --> 56:43.691
If this school doesn't work
or if you're out of options,

56:43.691 --> 56:44.776
let us know.

56:45.568 --> 56:48.530
But our friends
can't have you risking exposure

56:48.530 --> 56:53.576
and, by extension, their exposure,
from this line of work.

56:56.287 --> 56:57.872
Am I gonna be piss tested, too?

56:58.790 --> 57:01.793
I didn't want to do this, Max...
but I need it.

57:04.129 --> 57:04.838
The rifle.

57:06.631 --> 57:08.550
You think I keep a rifle here?

57:09.300 --> 57:10.593
Big Louie is outside,

57:11.261 --> 57:12.679
he'll have to have a look around.

57:14.389 --> 57:15.557
And I'll be late for work.

57:18.393 --> 57:19.811
You'll get the gun.

57:20.812 --> 57:22.730
You want me to lay off
the extracurriculars?

57:24.941 --> 57:26.151
Let me be on time.

57:28.695 --> 57:29.821
From here on out,

57:30.572 --> 57:32.282
if you get any calls,

57:33.199 --> 57:35.034
if any new offers are made,

57:36.494 --> 57:41.207
you will tell them that you have never
heard of a Max Bishop.

our girl in the pageant?

58:49.567 --> 58:50.818
She was brilliant!

58:51.027 --> 58:52.445
She is brilliant.

58:52.862 --> 58:55.365
You don't get to waddle out of your office
and tell us she isn't.

58:56.324 --> 58:57.492
You make me sick!

58:57.700 --> 58:59.661
You actually create nausea within me.

58:59.911 --> 59:03.665
So help me, if I do get sick,
I will get sick all over you, sir!

59:04.123 --> 59:08.294
You don't understand the severity
with which we could rearrange your life.

59:14.801 --> 59:17.095
And what's your role
in this monstrosity?

59:21.057 --> 59:22.684

59:35.321 --> 59:38.283
Do you even know what your Warta
has done to this school?

59:39.993 --> 59:40.994
My Warta?

59:44.455 --> 59:47.667
My Warta is striving to turn
this place into the finest

59:47.667 --> 59:51.296
institution of learning in the
entire tri-county area.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.548
WOMAN:
Oh, you think so?

59:56.301 --> 59:57.302
And let me add,

59:58.011 --> 59:59.596
I've been observing my Warta.

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:04.809
I dare anyone to endure a fraction
of what this man has put up with.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:07.604
A screaming child.

1:00:08.771 --> 1:00:10.690
A pitch that drives itself

1:00:10.690 --> 1:00:14.485
into the deepest, most sensitive
part of your soul with its contempt

1:00:14.485 --> 1:00:15.820
for your existence.

1:00:16.696 --> 1:00:18.823
Imagine more than one of those screams.

1:00:19.490 --> 1:00:20.825
Imagine a roomful.

1:00:22.368 --> 1:00:28.625
Imagine days, weeks, months,
years of your life consumed by this.

1:00:30.084 --> 1:00:30.877
For what?

1:00:32.462 --> 1:00:33.212
For you?

1:00:35.381 --> 1:00:36.049
No.

1:00:37.550 --> 1:00:39.218
I will leave you with this.

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:44.891
If I ever see you
treating my Warta like this again,

1:00:45.808 --> 1:00:48.186
you will experience the full wrath

1:00:48.186 --> 1:00:51.939
of the JP Melville Elementary
custodial department.

1:00:54.817 --> 1:00:56.986
Today will be Beatrice's last day.

1:01:02.283 --> 1:01:03.284
They're gone.

1:01:04.619 --> 1:01:06.746
I think they actually might be gone.

1:01:08.623 --> 1:01:09.248
No,

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:12.335
I think they're definitely gone.

1:01:14.921 --> 1:01:16.089
Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

1:01:16.881 --> 1:01:18.633
I- I need to sit and breathe.

1:01:19.842 --> 1:01:20.677
Principal Warta.

1:01:22.804 --> 1:01:23.930
Partridge and Hubert?

1:01:25.598 --> 1:01:26.641
They're good people.

1:01:30.978 --> 1:01:31.979
Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

1:01:33.564 --> 1:01:34.190
Yes.

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:35.983
Thank you.

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:54.752
(melancholy guitar strumming)

1:02:20.945 --> 1:02:22.739
(melancholy guitar fades out)

1:02:40.423 --> 1:02:43.092
(pleasant guitar strumming)

1:03:01.402 --> 1:03:03.571
(pleasant guitar fades out)

1:03:05.031 --> 1:03:05.865
Can I help you?

1:03:08.075 --> 1:03:09.869
I was told you might be around.

1:03:10.244 --> 1:03:11.037
You were told.

1:03:12.246 --> 1:03:14.415
I'm concerned because I think
I might know what's going on here.

1:03:16.083 --> 1:03:17.084
"What's going on here?"

1:03:18.002 --> 1:03:20.379
Well I'd say a cheap, knockoff replacement
may have been found.

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:23.007
That why you're sitting
up here with a spotlight?

1:03:23.716 --> 1:03:24.300
I mean...

1:03:25.092 --> 1:03:26.219
anyone can see you.

1:03:27.929 --> 1:03:29.138
What are you getting paid for this?

1:03:29.847 --> 1:03:30.223
Huh?

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:31.641
15,000.

1:03:32.433 --> 1:03:33.559
You think that's a fair price?

1:03:33.893 --> 1:03:35.978
No, I think it's the standard
rate of my employer.

1:03:36.187 --> 1:03:36.854
Who is?

1:03:44.737 --> 1:03:46.322
MAX:
"Consolidated Merchants?"

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:48.658
MAN:
Subsidiary of Holdings and Price.

1:03:49.742 --> 1:03:51.869
MAX: And your outfit goes around
undermining the jobs that people

1:03:51.869 --> 1:03:52.870
like me depend on?

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:54.997
MAN: Hey, if you got a beef,
call the number.

1:03:56.415 --> 1:03:58.543
MAX:
"Sam...Smith?"

1:04:00.127 --> 1:04:02.755
-Who specifically hired you?
-No idea.

1:04:03.256 --> 1:04:04.090
You paid to say that?

1:04:04.423 --> 1:04:06.050
No, I get paid to do a job.

1:04:06.634 --> 1:04:09.053
Now I've got another job in Springfield

1:04:09.095 --> 1:04:10.304
and another in Phoenix.

1:04:10.304 --> 1:04:11.681
Are you gonna let me get to them?

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:13.099
-Today?
-Yeah.

1:04:13.140 --> 1:04:14.141
You got a private jet?

1:04:14.308 --> 1:04:15.810
Company jet. Company pilot.

1:04:16.978 --> 1:04:17.895
MAX:
You serious?

1:04:18.437 --> 1:04:19.105
SAM:
Deadly.

1:04:21.274 --> 1:04:21.858
Well...

1:04:22.859 --> 1:04:24.610
let's say you needed
to stop off and see a movie-

1:04:25.862 --> 1:04:28.447
SAM: There's an armed drone. It's about
a hundred feet up in the air.

1:04:29.031 --> 1:04:31.701
Second trigger on my rifle
will send two hollow-point rounds

1:04:31.701 --> 1:04:32.869
through your chest cavity.

1:04:33.327 --> 1:04:35.621
Each bullet will expand upon entry,

1:04:35.746 --> 1:04:38.082
maximizing the elimination
of tissue and organ.

1:04:38.374 --> 1:04:39.333
MAX:
No shit?

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:40.376
SAM:
Shit yes.

1:04:44.005 --> 1:04:44.797
Private jet.

1:04:45.506 --> 1:04:46.257
Drones.

1:04:47.425 --> 1:04:48.426
But 15K?

1:04:48.759 --> 1:04:50.344
That's Consolidated Merchants.

1:04:52.638 --> 1:04:53.890
80 hour weeks.

1:04:54.515 --> 1:04:55.892
Flights every day.

1:04:56.142 --> 1:04:57.310
I-...it's-...

1:04:59.604 --> 1:05:00.813
You get good benefits, though?

1:05:01.230 --> 1:05:02.565
Oh, we're making jokes now?

1:05:03.649 --> 1:05:05.151
MAX:
But they can't do that, can they?

1:05:05.610 --> 1:05:08.362
SAM: Hey man, it's you against
Consolidated Merchants.

1:05:09.447 --> 1:05:13.200
To tell you the truth, I kinda envy
your sole proprietorship situation.

1:05:14.535 --> 1:05:16.537
MAX: That's not all it's cracked up to be,
let me tell ya.

1:05:17.872 --> 1:05:19.415
'Pay out your oriface in taxes.

1:05:19.540 --> 1:05:20.166
SAM:
Yeah...

1:05:21.417 --> 1:05:22.877
MAX: I just wish
I woulda had a heads up,

1:05:22.877 --> 1:05:25.838
-I've been nursing this contract
into a sweet package.
-[Sam sighs]

1:05:26.172 --> 1:05:27.131
MAX:
But, uhh...

1:05:28.883 --> 1:05:31.719
...I might be willing to negotiate
a severence or something.

1:05:32.219 --> 1:05:33.471
SAM:
Yeah, no, yeah, I could-

1:05:34.013 --> 1:05:35.681
SAM:
I can see that...I can see that.

1:05:38.559 --> 1:05:39.393
We friends now?

1:05:44.398 --> 1:05:44.941
Good.

1:05:45.816 --> 1:05:47.860
Now whack off, I need to do this.

1:05:48.694 --> 1:05:49.445
[Max scoffs]

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:54.617
-I'm sorry. Did you just say "whack off?"
-Whack yourself right off outta here.

1:05:56.369 --> 1:05:58.704
Cheap price. Three jobs in one day.

1:05:59.580 --> 1:06:00.498
That explains the rush

1:06:00.498 --> 1:06:03.376
and why you're up here
with the subtlety of a beached whale.

1:06:04.043 --> 1:06:06.879
You have no respect for your trade.

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:10.466
MAX: There is no honor
in a $15,000 crowd.

1:06:10.466 --> 1:06:11.467
SAM:
Yeah, so I've heard.

1:06:12.426 --> 1:06:14.637
MAX: Well, why doesn't your friend
in the sky just take care of it?

1:06:14.804 --> 1:06:15.513
SAM:
He's training.

1:06:16.180 --> 1:06:16.764
MAX:
He's what?

1:06:16.973 --> 1:06:19.308
SAM:
He's training. He's...analyzing.

1:06:19.725 --> 1:06:23.437
Observing every little pointless thing
that I do wrong so he can improve

1:06:23.437 --> 1:06:24.438
and I can be...

1:06:25.064 --> 1:06:25.815
redundant.

1:06:27.525 --> 1:06:29.276
I'm just waiting for my notice.

1:06:32.905 --> 1:06:33.656
I'm sorry.

1:06:34.156 --> 1:06:34.782
Yeah.

1:06:35.533 --> 1:06:36.534
Now, then...

1:06:37.660 --> 1:06:39.495
do I have your permission to proceed?

1:06:44.667 --> 1:06:45.251
Yeah.

1:06:46.585 --> 1:06:47.211
I'm good.

1:07:05.271 --> 1:07:06.772
[bird caws]

1:07:08.983 --> 1:07:11.193
(frantic acoustic guitar)

1:07:52.818 --> 1:07:54.570
So, what're we gonna play first?

1:07:54.612 --> 1:07:56.697
We're gonna play the game
where I'm the boss

1:07:56.697 --> 1:07:57.823
and you do what I say.

1:07:58.699 --> 1:08:00.701
I do that with my parents every day.

1:08:00.826 --> 1:08:02.578
Then I bet you're very good.
Where's your mommy's phone number?

1:08:03.662 --> 1:08:04.538
It's over there somewhere.

1:08:04.538 --> 1:08:05.998
Over here. Okay, uhh...

1:08:06.123 --> 1:08:08.751
is it- is it on a business card?
Or a note? Or a- uh-

1:08:09.210 --> 1:08:10.002
I need help.

1:08:10.294 --> 1:08:11.420
I have it in my head.

1:08:11.629 --> 1:08:12.379
In your head?

1:08:12.713 --> 1:08:15.049
Okay. Uhh...what is it?

1:08:15.216 --> 1:08:17.009
526 6821.

1:08:17.093 --> 1:08:17.968
Five two- what?

1:08:18.094 --> 1:08:19.386
6 6821.

1:08:19.553 --> 1:08:20.971
Six six- wait, what?

1:08:20.971 --> 1:08:22.056
6821.

1:08:22.223 --> 1:08:24.308
Uhh- the first numbers.

1:08:24.391 --> 1:08:25.309
668.

1:08:25.643 --> 1:08:26.602
Uhh...the-

1:08:26.727 --> 1:08:28.354
well- wh- what's the full number?

1:08:28.437 --> 1:08:30.231
526 6821.

1:08:31.524 --> 1:08:33.317
Okay. Okay, please.

1:08:33.526 --> 1:08:34.485
Please, just, you know...

1:08:34.693 --> 1:08:36.362
Okay, one time, j- just...

1:08:36.695 --> 1:08:38.197
one- one time- what?

1:08:38.823 --> 1:08:39.406
No?

1:08:39.615 --> 1:08:41.742
Oookay, uhh, uhh,

1:08:41.951 --> 1:08:43.744
there are other things we can do.

1:08:43.744 --> 1:08:46.247
Uh, this is not
a super serious situation.

1:08:46.455 --> 1:08:48.124
-Uh, uh-
-I talked to someone yesterday

1:08:48.290 --> 1:08:50.960
who said if you have a problem,
it's best not to rush things.

1:08:51.252 --> 1:08:53.045
You should always try to take it in-

1:08:53.045 --> 1:08:55.548
Yeah, like, I'm sure, like, that was
a great piece of information

1:08:55.548 --> 1:08:57.216
-in the moment, but right now we-

-LUCY: Hey guys.
-RUBY: Hi Lucy.

1:09:11.438 --> 1:09:14.441
Max, I got your letter.
Just so you know, it's not Tourette's.

1:09:14.817 --> 1:09:17.611
Ruby has a social condition
that sometimes fails to inhibit

1:09:17.611 --> 1:09:19.155
common emotion and behaviors.

1:09:19.363 --> 1:09:21.073
That's why we're gonna be friends now.

1:09:21.115 --> 1:09:22.449
RUBY:
Yeah, I didn't mean to yell.

1:09:23.242 --> 1:09:24.451
LUCY:
Everything else okay?

1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:28.330
Not really.

1:09:29.206 --> 1:09:30.666
He shot a guy up there.

1:09:31.375 --> 1:09:32.668
Makes sense, thank you.

1:09:33.919 --> 1:09:35.713
Max, was it because
you shot a guy up there?

1:09:36.755 --> 1:09:37.923
He was gonna kill Ruby.

1:09:38.632 --> 1:09:40.551
So you were trying to protect her...

1:09:41.427 --> 1:09:41.927
What?

1:09:42.511 --> 1:09:43.012
No.

1:09:43.387 --> 1:09:43.762
No!

1:09:44.013 --> 1:09:46.599
I was trying to build up the contract.

1:09:47.224 --> 1:09:48.934
I did not get soft on the job.

1:09:49.143 --> 1:09:50.477
No, no, no, no, no.

1:09:50.769 --> 1:09:53.105
I don't particularly care
for either one of you two

1:09:53.105 --> 1:09:54.565
as a matter of fact. Okay?

1:09:55.399 --> 1:09:58.027
Let's get that straight. Right now.

1:10:00.321 --> 1:10:02.072
My dad said
he'll pay you for your time.

1:10:02.531 --> 1:10:03.657
He asked about a time sheet?

1:10:04.408 --> 1:10:05.075
Sure.

1:10:07.328 --> 1:10:08.078
We gotta go!

1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:09.246
-Where?
-We're gonna go to the-

1:10:09.246 --> 1:10:09.788
Why?

1:10:09.914 --> 1:10:11.707
Do we have time to watch
the rest of Toony Town?

1:10:11.790 --> 1:10:12.833
Toony Town? No!

1:10:12.875 --> 1:10:14.335
Oh my gosh, I love that show!

1:10:14.335 --> 1:10:15.127
-No!
-Me too!

1:10:15.127 --> 1:10:16.086
-No!
-Remember when the guy

1:10:16.086 --> 1:10:17.338
-No!

1:11:10.724 --> 1:11:11.725
I'm not Mr. Bishop.

1:11:11.850 --> 1:11:12.977
You're not Mr. Bishop?

1:11:14.186 --> 1:11:15.104
No, I'm not.

1:11:15.688 --> 1:11:17.815
There's nobody here by that name.

1:11:17.982 --> 1:11:20.317
By the name of a Mr. Max Bishop?

1:11:22.861 --> 1:11:23.404
No.

1:11:23.696 --> 1:11:25.364
Well I find that hard to believe.

1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:27.408
You find that hard to believe?

1:11:27.616 --> 1:11:28.742
I do, indeed, sir.

1:11:28.867 --> 1:11:33.080
You see, I pilot a private aircraft
and my passenger seems to have gone missing.

1:11:33.414 --> 1:11:34.081
Oh no.

1:11:34.081 --> 1:11:34.957
Oh yes.

1:11:35.124 --> 1:11:37.710
Yes, you see,
when I lost contact with him

1:11:37.876 --> 1:11:40.587
he was in the company
of a Mr. Max Bishop.

1:11:41.547 --> 1:11:43.173
Well I should think
you'd wanna find him.

1:11:43.299 --> 1:11:43.924
Yes.

1:11:44.258 --> 1:11:47.011
Well, I don't believe
he could've gotten far, so

1:11:47.177 --> 1:11:48.220
at the very least

1:11:48.512 --> 1:11:50.389
would you mind
if I had a look around?

1:11:51.598 --> 1:11:52.850
In this house?

1:11:52.933 --> 1:11:53.600
Yes.

1:11:53.892 --> 1:11:54.560
Oh no.

1:11:54.643 --> 1:11:55.352
No?

1:11:56.145 --> 1:11:58.272
This is a respectable house.

1:11:58.897 --> 1:12:00.316
Respectable people.

1:12:01.650 --> 1:12:04.820
We don't want anybody like you
scrambling around in here.

1:12:04.862 --> 1:12:09.700
Sir, I don't appreciate the insinuations,
I'm just here to find someone.

1:12:10.034 --> 1:12:13.454
Is there a reason you don't want me
coming inside?

1:12:14.413 --> 1:12:17.416
Well, because I have nothing to do
with you, or this...

1:12:17.958 --> 1:12:20.336
uhh, Max, is it?

1:12:20.461 --> 1:12:21.837
Nothing at all?

1:12:23.505 --> 1:12:24.506
Nothing at all.

1:12:27.092 --> 1:12:28.260
[tired sigh]

1:12:28.844 --> 1:12:30.262
You must forgive me, sir.

1:12:30.471 --> 1:12:31.889
This passenger of mine,

1:12:32.181 --> 1:12:34.433
not only is he a client, he's a...

1:12:35.392 --> 1:12:37.061
a dear friend.

1:12:37.978 --> 1:12:38.979
I'm sorry.

1:12:39.063 --> 1:12:41.607
I must have let my emotions
get the better of me.

1:12:42.066 --> 1:12:42.858
You're right.

1:12:43.067 --> 1:12:45.444
You have every reason
not to let me in.

1:12:47.821 --> 1:12:48.655
Well, thank you.

1:12:48.906 --> 1:12:50.366
I hope I didn't disturb you.

1:12:50.908 --> 1:12:53.369
It's quite alright.
Disturbance avoided.

1:12:53.577 --> 1:12:55.245
I thank you for your understanding.

1:12:55.537 --> 1:12:56.330
Of course.

1:12:56.330 --> 1:12:57.706
Enjoy the rest of your day.

1:12:58.832 --> 1:12:59.792
And you as well.

1:13:00.501 --> 1:13:01.710
And Mr. Bishop?

1:13:02.878 --> 1:13:03.796
Yes?

1:13:05.214 --> 1:13:06.590
Max.

1:13:07.007 --> 1:13:12.971
I apologize that our brief, but enjoyable,
engagement must now come to an end.

1:13:13.555 --> 1:13:15.057
