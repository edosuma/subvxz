I figured if Stuart
wasn't comfortable enough
to be a hero at the diner,

well, maybe he'd feel
more comfortable in the place...

I caught up with Stuart,

just a fellow bowler,
he let me buy him some pie.

I love pie. And as people do
when they eat pie, we talked.

wasn't Stuart's idea.

was in his blood,

15:58.025 --> 16:00.160
it just wasn't in his heart.

he felt good about himself
was when he was bowling.

I ever really wanted to be
was a professional bowler.

And that's when I realized,

karma brought me here
to help Stuart's career,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.302
but not his police career.

You may as well spend it
doing what you love.

bowler than you are a cop.

I may not have gotten Stuart
his police career back,

what karma had in mind.

what he wanted with his life.

him off my list.

be a cop anymore.

about my list...
