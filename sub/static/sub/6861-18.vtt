WEBVTT

00:03.171 --> 00:05.005
Zoe knows about us.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.375
WADE: Why you stopped our little
 frolic the other night?

00:07.375 --> 00:08.576
You got googly eyes
for golden boy George?

00:08.576 --> 00:10.078
The minute that I tell
George the truth,

00:10.078 --> 00:12.080
who do you think
he's gonna go running to?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.781
I know that you
know that I know.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.483
I am never
telling George

00:15.483 --> 00:18.086
because I have no interest
in being the person to break

00:18.086 --> 00:19.187
George's heart.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.888
Would it be so bad
if he found out?

00:20.888 --> 00:22.890
Oh, Lavon, don't.
Because
if he broke up with you,

00:22.890 --> 00:24.592
I would be here, Lemon.
(gasps)

00:32.100 --> 00:35.203
Chet Marbury.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.339
Sally Guest.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.243
(sighing)

00:43.811 --> 00:45.646
What are we looking at?

00:45.646 --> 00:47.981
Oh, nothing; it's just
for a case I'm trying.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.617
Seeing what
a witness

00:49.617 --> 00:52.920
may or may not be able
to see from this distance.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.323
but it's, it's
pretty far.

00:55.323 --> 00:56.657
Oh, perfect,
perfect.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.591
Hey, Wade,

00:57.591 --> 00:58.692
can you stand

00:58.692 --> 00:59.660
just a,

00:59.660 --> 01:01.862
just a little bit over?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.131
Perfect, perfect.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.498
Definitely a killer.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.734
Zoe, could you
go join him,

01:06.734 --> 01:08.736
please?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.873
Great.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.508
(clears throat)

01:15.743 --> 01:16.810
'Sup?

01:16.810 --> 01:19.380
Not much.
GEORGE: You know
what, guys?

01:19.380 --> 01:21.549
I need you
closer, actually,
if you could.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.617
Just real close,
real close.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.355
GEORGE:
No. Guys,

01:27.355 --> 01:28.522
just a little bit closer,

01:28.522 --> 01:29.657
if you
wouldn't mind.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.559
Wade, if you could
just lean down.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.161
There we go.
Okay, all right,

01:33.161 --> 01:35.896
you know...
I got to work, okay?

01:35.896 --> 01:37.298
Thank you, George.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.933
Hey, are we still on
for hunting later?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.034
You coming by?

01:41.034 --> 01:42.203
Oh, uh, you know what?

01:42.203 --> 01:43.537
I completely
forgot about that.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.506
I don't even know if I
want to do it anymore.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.674
My dad's still
in the hospital,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.409
and my brother
just cancelled.
No.

01:48.409 --> 01:52.213
No, no. It's
your bachelor party.
You got to do it.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.114
I even came up with
a name for the weekend--

01:54.114 --> 01:55.716
it's called
"Locked and Loaded."

01:55.716 --> 01:59.320
'Cause we got guns...
 and we're gonna be drunk.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.488
(stifled laugh)

02:00.488 --> 02:01.655
Shut up.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.591
Yeah, I got that.

02:03.591 --> 02:04.592
I got that.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.327
I'll tell you what,
I'll, uh...

02:06.327 --> 02:07.728
I'll think about it.
It's your bachelor party,

02:07.728 --> 02:09.396
George, okay?
Just remember that.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.299
Okay, I'll let you know.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.334
Wow, bachelor party. Yikes.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.569
That old wedding's
coming up pretty soon, huh?

02:15.569 --> 02:18.272
Yeah. See, the problem is,
is that it was dark out.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.475
You know, things just
look so much different
in the light of day.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.678
Oh. Well, you know what,
maybe your person has bad eyes.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.080
Why don't you send
them in for an exam.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.816
I could be, like,
a key witness.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.485
I've always wanted
to be one of those.
(chuckles)

02:31.485 --> 02:34.255
(yawns):
Zoe. George.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.090
Lavon.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.826
Big night?

02:38.826 --> 02:39.927
Yup.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.696
No, you know,
not-not too big.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.899
Huh.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.401
(exhales)
Hmm.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.902
Well, three is a crowd.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.104
I'm gonna get to work.
So you're not
gonna eat?

02:51.104 --> 02:52.573
I forgot--
I already ate.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.808
I am full.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.211
But you...

02:57.211 --> 02:59.213
ZOE:
 I hate small towns.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.981
Everyone I know lives here,

03:00.981 --> 03:03.851
and there are only, like,
nine people in the whole town.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.053
So you have to keep track
of everyone's secrets.

03:06.053 --> 03:09.022
In New York, I could ride next
to someone on the subway,

03:09.022 --> 03:12.526
learn all about them--
about their kids, their
hopes, their dreams--

03:12.526 --> 03:15.128
and never have to
think about them again.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.530
It was great.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.266
You know, I don't
even really live here.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.268
That's why I am done;
I am officially out

03:20.268 --> 03:23.404
of the being-in-the-
middle-of-everyone's-
business business.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.806
Well, I don't live here.

03:27.941 --> 03:28.742
I'm Jesse.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.544
I'm-I'm Zoe.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.746
Dr. Hart.
Dr. Zoe Hart.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.847
Zoe.
Yeah.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.748
Yeah. (laughs)

03:34.748 --> 03:36.250
Sorry, I've just
been talking

03:36.250 --> 03:37.785
all about me--
I didn't even ask you

03:37.785 --> 03:39.420
how you sprained
your wrist.
Oh.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.889
Ninja stuff. Boring.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.293
(laughs) Well, how did
a ninja wind up in this
small little town?

03:45.293 --> 03:47.795
Well, you are sworn
to secrecy, right?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.129
Being my doctor?

03:49.129 --> 03:50.163
Mm-hmm, absolutely.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.699
Antiquing.
Really?

03:51.699 --> 03:53.334
And some murdering,
you know, whatnot.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.568
(laughs)

03:54.568 --> 03:57.305
But, uh, I am free
for lunch, if you like?

03:57.305 --> 03:58.772
Lunch with a ninja?

03:58.772 --> 04:01.642
Yeah.
One more think I can
check off my bucket list.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.876
There it is.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.645
Boom.
(laughs)

04:09.383 --> 04:12.720
Mmm.
Oh, oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.855
Mm, why are you not dressed
for my bachelorette party?

04:14.855 --> 04:16.724
I know how long it
takes to dress myself.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.992
I do it a lot.
Okay, fine.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.962
Um, so you're sure that
all the reservations
are set? The hotel...

04:21.962 --> 04:26.066
Yes. Lemon, the maid of
honor plans the party,
and I planned it.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.768
I know.

04:27.768 --> 04:31.004
And I'm so, so happy
that you're my maid of honor

04:31.004 --> 04:34.007
and that my sister is gonna
be with me every step of
the way through this.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.609
Aw...
Now, just one more
time to make sure.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.211
You definitely
have all...
Oh, my God,

04:38.211 --> 04:41.014
for the millionth time, yes, I
booked the boring spa in Mobile,

04:41.014 --> 04:44.084
yes, we have reservations at
Mobile's most boring restaurant,

04:44.084 --> 04:47.388
and yes, we're staying
at the dullest hotel
in America,

04:47.388 --> 04:51.525
where we'll all stay in
and rent the dumbest
movie ever made.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.093
I promise you...

04:53.093 --> 04:56.096
it'll be the most boring weekend
you could ever imagine.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.164
(squeals)

04:57.164 --> 04:58.799
Perfect!

04:58.799 --> 04:59.867
Ooh!

05:00.901 --> 05:02.035
(exhales)

05:02.035 --> 05:03.170
* *

05:03.170 --> 05:05.739
(Lavon mumbling)

05:05.739 --> 05:07.040
Hangover?

05:07.040 --> 05:09.076
What can I
get for you?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.511
A quick burial.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.213
Nothing fancy.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.882
Maybe say a few words.

05:14.882 --> 05:19.453
Or you could have
my extra-special,
top-secret...

05:19.453 --> 05:21.655
with-robin-egg...
hangover cure.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.091
Old Kinsella recipe right
there, shell and all.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.093
Mm-hmm.
(phone ringing)

05:26.093 --> 05:27.428
Oh!

05:27.428 --> 05:29.497
This is my hangover cure,

05:29.497 --> 05:30.531
right there.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.567
Cancel my day.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.336
Cannot spend
the last minutes of my life

05:36.336 --> 05:38.138
listening to complaints

05:38.138 --> 05:39.139
about trash pickup.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.741
Just... shoot me now.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.875
(laughs)

05:42.876 --> 05:44.645
(knocking)

05:44.645 --> 05:46.279
Hello.
Hey, George.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.148
Come in.
Everything okay?

05:48.148 --> 05:52.420
Yeah. Um, this morning,
you said that my eyewitness
might need an eye exam.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.789
Well, the eyewitness is me.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.958
Okay. You want
an eye exam?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.126
No. I...

05:59.126 --> 06:02.430
I think my eyes are fine.

06:02.430 --> 06:06.500
Is-is post-traumatic
stress disorder, is
that a real thing?

06:06.500 --> 06:09.102
Yes. Has something happened?

06:09.102 --> 06:11.371
My dad's heart attack,
you know, it was
pretty traumatic,

06:11.371 --> 06:12.840
and I haven't
been sleeping lately,

06:12.840 --> 06:17.144
and I was wondering if
that might make me see things

06:17.144 --> 06:19.447
that aren't really there.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.249
George, what's up?

06:22.249 --> 06:24.618
(sighs)

06:27.621 --> 06:30.390
(exhales)
Okay, I need to talk to someone,

06:30.390 --> 06:32.392
because if it's
not medical or mental,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.895
then I saw Lemon
kissing Lavon last night.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.564
What?
Yeah.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.632
I don't know
if I did...

06:38.632 --> 06:41.134
No. I mean, probably not.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.737
It must have been
something else
that you saw.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.339
But like you said, you're
sleep-deprived, right?

06:46.339 --> 06:48.709
Yeah. And I only saw it
for a second.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.078
I saw it, I looked away,
I looked back,

06:51.078 --> 06:53.013
and they were gone,
so I've just been

06:53.013 --> 06:55.148
racking my brain all day
trying to figure out

06:55.148 --> 06:57.618
what else it could've
possibly been, but I don't...

06:57.618 --> 07:00.688
You know, maybe, um, he was
whispering in her ear.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.557
You know? Or, um, I
used to have this cat

07:03.557 --> 07:06.193
who would always try to
take food out of my mouth.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.661
It was really cute.

07:09.162 --> 07:12.500
(laughs)
I-I don't quite think that's...
Probably not that.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.635
But-but talking...

07:14.635 --> 07:16.504
talking, right?

07:16.504 --> 07:17.938
Like, um, close...

07:17.938 --> 07:19.573
close talking...

07:19.573 --> 07:21.709
like this c-could
look like kissing.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.044
You know, and if anyone saw
us right now, they would

07:24.044 --> 07:26.346
think we were kissing,
but we're not.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.248
(electronic tones sound)

07:28.248 --> 07:29.917
Right. Um...
(clears throat)

07:29.917 --> 07:31.318
you know what,
you're probably right.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.653
And I definitely

07:32.653 --> 07:35.856
do need to know what I saw
before I say anything.

07:35.856 --> 07:36.724
I'm sure

07:36.724 --> 07:38.258
it wasn't even Lavon.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.793
No? Why?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.395
Because he was
home all night.
He was? You saw him?

07:42.395 --> 07:43.463
I-I heard him.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.298
You know, the TV,
music was on.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.734
He was there,
I'm pretty sure.

07:46.734 --> 07:50.270
And why wouldn't you...
say that a minute ago?

07:50.270 --> 07:52.372
(laughs):
Because I forgot.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.575
I am also sleep-deprived.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.076
Right. Thank you.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.079
I just didn't know who else
I could trust to talk to.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.285
(sighs)

08:05.285 --> 08:08.155
(door opens)

08:08.155 --> 08:10.858
(door closes)
(sighs)

08:12.960 --> 08:14.227
(dialing)

08:17.230 --> 08:18.766
Lavon, it's Zoe.

08:18.766 --> 08:22.302
George Tucker
saw you kissing Lemon.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.704
What the hell?

08:23.704 --> 08:26.506
You said it was over.
Call me.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.611
Well? Hangover's gone, right?
This is

08:30.611 --> 08:31.945
a magic potion.
(laughs)

08:31.945 --> 08:34.648
No, no, you, my friend,
are a purveyor of magic.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.849
No, no, in
earlier times,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.217
you would've been worshipped.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.453
Or killed-- depending
on the current theology.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.789
(slaps bar, whoops)

08:41.789 --> 08:43.657
(chuckles) Now, I am
gonna go freshen up

08:43.657 --> 08:46.860
a-and re-approach
this entire day.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.330
(laughs)

08:50.330 --> 08:52.099
Oh...

08:55.569 --> 08:57.705
Wade.
Jesse.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.340
Mind if I take a look at a menu?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.943
I don't think my say-so carries
much weight in the matter.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.945
* *

09:08.682 --> 09:11.752
All right, you ready
to go hunt some turkeys?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.721
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, hey,
I'm glad you had

09:13.721 --> 09:15.488
a change of, uh,
change of heart.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.556
You're going hunting?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.391
Uh, no.
Why do you want

09:18.391 --> 09:21.428
to shoot living things?
Shooting dead ones isn't
that sporting, Tom.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.797
Yeah, and there's probably
a law against it.
You're not funny.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.599
Imagine your surprise
if, like, a deer

09:25.599 --> 09:27.601
just came up and shot you

09:27.601 --> 09:28.769
where you stood.
Wow.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.038
I would be surprised
if that happened.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.240
Yeah, how'd a deer
get ammunition?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.642
Killers.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.277
(George and Wade laughing)

09:38.578 --> 09:40.447
Oh...
(clears throat)

09:40.447 --> 09:41.649
Lavon.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.983
George.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.885
Wade, you ready to go?
Hey, George,

09:44.885 --> 09:46.186
your dad's in the
hospital, right?

09:46.186 --> 09:48.455
So we got an extra
bed at the cabin--

09:48.455 --> 09:49.623
why don't we have Lavon?

09:49.623 --> 09:51.491
LAVON:
Say what?

09:51.491 --> 09:52.626
Well, you're feeling
better, yeah?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.127
Yeah, but...
And you said

09:54.127 --> 09:54.928
you cleared

09:54.928 --> 09:56.529
your whole day already.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.298
I did say that.
Yes, I did.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.668
Look, George, I know
it's your bachelor party,

10:00.668 --> 10:02.535
so, you know, you can
have the final say,

10:02.535 --> 10:03.937
but...

10:03.937 --> 10:06.473
No, I mean, it's-it's
Lavon. Of course.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.776
I mean, you-you should come,
you know, if you w...

10:08.776 --> 10:12.079
Unless, there... would
be some reason that you
wouldn't want to come.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.814
(laughs)
Why wouldn't he
want to come

10:13.814 --> 10:16.516
hang out with you
and me and the boys?

10:16.516 --> 10:17.985
(chuckling):
No reason at all.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.687
Let's do some hunting!
All right,
let's all go

10:19.687 --> 10:21.955
gather up our gear, and then
we'll head up to Johnson's Fork.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.423
Sound good?
One thing.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.792
It is a bachelor party,

10:24.792 --> 10:26.960
which means...

10:26.960 --> 10:30.430
no work-- cell phones,
pagers, whatever you use

10:30.430 --> 10:33.300
to communicate with the
outside world goes in here.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.736
Come on, now.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.373
(car horn honks)

10:40.373 --> 10:42.475
(seagulls calling)

10:42.475 --> 10:44.778
(birds singing)

10:49.416 --> 10:51.318
(laughter, quiet chatter)

10:51.318 --> 10:52.786
Lemon!

10:55.288 --> 10:56.423
AnnaBeth.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.226
I'm surprised to see you.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.162
Oh? My invitation
wasn't rescinded, was it?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.264
Oh, goodness, no.
Why on Earth?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.767
After I was awarded the
Memory Matron position?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.401
The what?
Memory Matron.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.573
Oh! No, no, no,
no, no, no, silly.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.008
It seems like lifetimes ago

11:15.008 --> 11:17.177
since those things mattered
to me. No, no, no.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.780
Well, it mattered enough to you
to strip me of my job

11:19.780 --> 11:21.381
of planning
your bachelorette party, so...

11:21.381 --> 11:22.315
(laughs)

11:22.315 --> 11:24.117
Actually, I thought
that it would be

11:24.117 --> 11:25.618
a good experience for Magnolia.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.720
I mean, she has been

11:26.720 --> 11:28.388
by my side for all
of these years.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.191
She's been so... loyal.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.092
Mm.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.061
And I, for one,
cannot wait to see

11:34.061 --> 11:35.863
what kind of a party
a 14-year-old

11:35.863 --> 11:37.497
has planned.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.766
Will there be a bouncy house?

11:38.766 --> 11:40.400
You know what, AnnaBeth?

11:40.400 --> 11:43.303
Why don't you go find yourself
another roadside accident

11:43.303 --> 11:45.906
to go put your morbid
gaze upon, because...

11:45.906 --> 11:48.675
Magnolia has done
a beautiful job

11:48.675 --> 11:50.277
anticipating my needs.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.912
She knows me

11:51.912 --> 11:53.914
just through and through
and through.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.148
And I, quite frankly,
can't think

11:55.148 --> 11:57.117
of a better person
to plan the party.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.151
Can you?

11:58.151 --> 11:59.352
(chuckles)

11:59.352 --> 12:01.221
(laughs)
Come on.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.555
(car horn honking)

12:02.555 --> 12:03.791
* *

12:03.791 --> 12:06.093
Surprise!
Forget the boring spa.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.961
We are going to the
FloriBama Beach

12:07.961 --> 12:10.397
Bar and Grill
for a real party!

12:10.397 --> 12:11.899
We're what?
Yeah.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.703
Oh, you look
so surprised.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.839
Look at you.
Are you surprised?

12:18.839 --> 12:21.708
It has a, um... a stripper pole.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.843
Yes.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.744
It's so you!

12:40.460 --> 12:41.895
Zoe.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.363
Hey.
Hey.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.597
Jesse.
Oh... sorry.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.866
Am I late
for our lunch?

12:45.866 --> 12:47.134
No.
Time got away from me.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.036
Which is weird
'cause it usually moves

12:49.036 --> 12:50.737
painfully slow in BlueBell.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.806
You need to move this
back a little bit?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.074
No. No, you know what?

12:54.074 --> 12:55.976
I was just looking
for someone, but no luck.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.577
So I am all yours.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.212
All right.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.749
Here you are.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.784
That is so sweet.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.954
Thank you.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.422
So... how's it going?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.491
You know, staying out of other
people's business, I mean.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.625
How is that going?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.760
Great.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.895
So awesome. Yeah.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.029
How's yours?

13:16.029 --> 13:17.597
I mean,
your business.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.766
Other than being a ninja,
which we've already covered.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.334
Right.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.036
Uh, hmm.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.706
Zoe, I got to talk to
you about something.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.275
I... I'm not a ninja.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.043
Check, please.
I just said it
to impress you.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.311
But then I started
thinking about it.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.013
You know, what if
we were actually

13:33.013 --> 13:34.481
in a situation
together that required

13:34.481 --> 13:36.749
I commit covert acts
of feudal warfare?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.351
I'm going to look
like a tool.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.922
So... not a ninja.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.225
Just a... eco-geological
oceanographer.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.927
Thank you so much
for telling me that.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.461
Mm-hmm.
Can you tell me
one more thing?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.931
What the hell is an
eco-geological oceanographer?

13:50.931 --> 13:53.233
You know, I'm not
sure about that,

13:53.233 --> 13:55.068
but, uh, school was
pretty tough, so, uh,

13:55.068 --> 13:56.970
whatever it is, it's
probably pretty important.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.841
Sorry.
Listen.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.210
If there's something
you need to finish

14:03.210 --> 14:04.945
before we do this,
that's okay.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.079
No. No, you know what?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.814
I tried, but Lavon
is a big boy.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.649
He can take care
of his own affairs.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.584
His own business.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.420
Business.
Lavon Hayes?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.787
You know Lavon?

14:14.787 --> 14:15.889
Mm. Yeah.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.090
No, I grew up
here originally.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.325
Everybody knows Lavon.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.627
Yeah. No, he was
here earlier.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.696
Uh, left with George Tucker,
Wade, couple fellas.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.198
Lavon is with George?
Yeah.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.967
They went hunting out
at Johnson's Fork.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.868
Hunting?
Yeah.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.870
With guns?
Probably.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.973
You know what, I'm sorry.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.774
I really... I really want
to eat, but, um,

14:34.774 --> 14:37.144
first, can you give me a ride
to Lemon Breeland's?

14:37.144 --> 14:38.511
Hmm. Let me guess.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.381
So you can stay out of
her business as well.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.420
Yes, sir!

14:47.420 --> 14:49.256
Gentlemen!

14:49.256 --> 14:52.125
Tonight, we will gather
around the fire,

14:52.125 --> 14:54.261
and we will prepare
for the hunt

14:54.261 --> 14:57.264
in a tradition that has been
observed countless times

14:57.264 --> 14:59.732
by men of tribes
from all over the world

14:59.732 --> 15:01.034
and on The Learning Channel.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.137
And tomorrow,
we hunt

15:04.137 --> 15:07.274
because we are men.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.510
Men who, uh, need more firewood.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.779
Hey, Lavon, uh,
you want to help George

15:12.779 --> 15:14.481
get some more
firewood?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.952
Yeah. Uh, you bet.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.288
Yeah.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.423
How did you
arrange all this anyways?

15:23.423 --> 15:25.025
Well, Daddy gave
me his credit card

15:25.025 --> 15:27.294
and said to do whatever it
took to make you happy.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.462
Do I look happy?
I don't know.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.797
You look about the
same as always.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.632
So there are no
hotel reservations?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.367
No spa, nothing? Just...?

15:34.367 --> 15:35.435
Well, no.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.337
I thought, with you
trying to elope and all,

15:37.337 --> 15:39.806
that you wanted to loosen
up and be different.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.074
Not that different!

15:41.074 --> 15:42.909
Not having my one and only
bachelorette party

15:42.909 --> 15:44.744
on a stripper bus
to a beach bar!

15:44.744 --> 15:46.513
(knock at door)

15:46.513 --> 15:48.081
Hey. Got a sec?

15:48.081 --> 15:51.051
Okay, Magnolia,
you head on out,

15:51.051 --> 15:54.487
and we will figure this...
figure this out.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.090
Hi.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.691
Pretty bus.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.629
This is awkward because...
you weren't invited.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.563
I know.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.798
But remember that secret
you told me,

16:05.798 --> 16:08.468
that I promised I would
never tell, that I didn't?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.737
Well, George saw you
with Lavon last night.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.076
Oh, God.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.912
Okay, let me think.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.948
Um... uh, what did he say?

16:21.948 --> 16:23.216
Oh, he's pretty sure

16:23.216 --> 16:24.884
that he saw you kissing Lavon.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.787
I lied for you, but I'm not sure
that he bought it.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.089
Pretty sure?

16:29.089 --> 16:31.358
Okay, well, um...

16:31.358 --> 16:33.593
George is... he's an attorney,

16:33.593 --> 16:36.696
so he would never make
any accusation

16:36.696 --> 16:37.964
without being certain.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.366
And he's away hunting
for the weekend,

16:39.366 --> 16:41.134
so I can, um, go find Lavon,

16:41.134 --> 16:42.835
and-and-and we can get
our stories straight.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.237
Oh, no, Lemon.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.505
That's the problem.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.540
Lavon went hunting with George.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.641
Oh.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.977
What a bad day
this has turned out to be.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.245
Yeah, but I met this guy

16:52.245 --> 16:53.880
who knows exactly
where the hunting spot is.

16:53.880 --> 16:54.981
He says he can direct you.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.116
Direct me?
Mm-hmm.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.717
Oh, no, you're coming with me.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.719
Oh, no. No.
Oh, yes.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.088
Uh-uh. No.
Uh-huh. Oh, yes.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.689
See, I am doing this thing now

17:02.689 --> 17:04.723
where I stay out
of people's problems.

17:04.723 --> 17:05.892
No.
Oh, no.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.294
You are already
knee-deep

17:07.294 --> 17:08.861
in the middle
of this problem, lady.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.163
You are in the sweet,
chewy center

17:10.163 --> 17:11.364
of the whole damn thing.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.398
So you know what
we're going to do?

17:12.398 --> 17:13.532
You are going
to come with me,

17:13.532 --> 17:14.867
you're going
to take Lavon aside,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.069
and then I'm going
to handle George, okay?

17:18.505 --> 17:19.705
Okay.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.474
What are you going to do
about that party out front?

17:24.144 --> 17:25.311
Okay, just a quick detour

17:25.311 --> 17:27.146
to, uh, give a message
to my Georgie,

17:27.146 --> 17:29.349
and then we're
on our way!

17:29.349 --> 17:31.884
Yay!

17:31.884 --> 17:34.454
* *

17:41.194 --> 17:42.529
JESSE:
 Make a right.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.531
Head on up to Johnson's Fork.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.034
This is all
your fault.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.137
If you would have done
what I said to...

17:50.137 --> 17:51.604
if you would
have told...

17:53.406 --> 17:56.109
If you would have
told your gardener

17:56.109 --> 17:57.744
about your
previous gardener,

17:57.744 --> 17:59.646
you wouldn't be
in this situation.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.782
Well, I couldn't tell
the gardener,

18:02.782 --> 18:06.186
because his father
was in the hospital with...

18:07.019 --> 18:09.456
...a snakebite, and it wasn't

18:09.456 --> 18:11.191
(whispers):
the right time.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.293
Well, you told me
that you had already fired

18:13.293 --> 18:14.727
the first gardener anyway.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.264
I fired the gardener,
but he wanted his old job back.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.898
That is not my fault.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.367
No one needs that
many gardeners

18:20.367 --> 18:22.535
no matter how
high-maintenance
her property is.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.836
MAGNOLIA:
I should've known

18:23.836 --> 18:26.173
Lemon wouldn't appreciate
anything I did.

18:26.173 --> 18:29.176
God forbid anyone
ever have fun.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.977
(laughs):
I'm sure she'll survive.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.679
And she can't stay mad forever.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.315
She can.
You don't know her.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.749
Oh, I've known her
my whole life.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.951
She's mad at me now,
but she'll get over it.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.353
That's why I came today.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.022
Because neither of us
would forgive ourselves later

18:43.022 --> 18:45.024
if I didn't.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.560
Now, the deed is done;
it's over.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.563
So let's just enjoy the day.
Okay.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.499
DRIVER: Folks, we are gonna
have to pull over.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.434
We got to stop for the police.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.570
Uh, it's not entirely over.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.672
(hip-hop playing)
Freeze, ladies!

18:59.672 --> 19:01.308
You have the right

19:01.308 --> 19:03.676
to remain... sexy.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.679
* *

19:06.679 --> 19:09.148
(women laughing)

19:14.587 --> 19:16.923
Now I sort of feel bad,
'cause, uh,

19:16.923 --> 19:18.791
all I got you is a flower.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.793
(women whooping)

19:20.793 --> 19:23.530
* *

19:25.932 --> 19:27.234
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:27.234 --> 19:29.436
All right!
(laughs)

19:30.370 --> 19:32.805
Hey, guys, hey,
where are the guns?

19:32.805 --> 19:35.342
They were right there;
where'd they go?

19:36.809 --> 19:39.412
Where they
can't be used to kill.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.782
Tom?

19:42.782 --> 19:45.818
How'd you get here first?
Drove like the wind.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.186
Almost hit a deer, too--

19:47.186 --> 19:49.422
the irony of which
was not lost on me.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.392
But I made it;
I made it in time
to stop you.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.061
Tom... I know wackos
are in season, but I'd be

19:55.061 --> 19:57.830
more than happy to strap you
to the fender of my car

19:57.830 --> 19:59.932
if you don't, uh,
show me where those guns are.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.969
No problem-- it's
just, they're gonna
be kind of useless

20:02.969 --> 20:06.138
without the shells.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, no, don't!

20:06.138 --> 20:07.240
Oh... oh...

20:07.240 --> 20:10.142
(shotgun shell blasts)

20:10.142 --> 20:13.446
(explosions continue)

20:16.249 --> 20:19.151
Oh...

20:19.151 --> 20:20.420
(shell explodes)

20:20.420 --> 20:23.723
(shells exploding in distance)
Whoa.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.759
(chuckles) I guess
they decided to
start without us.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.695
(chuckling): Yeah.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.299
So, hey, man, I've been
meaning to ask you--

20:32.299 --> 20:35.034
wh-what happened
between you and Didi?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.703
Didi?
Yeah.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.372
Oh... it just didn't work out.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.374
You know how it is.
That's too bad.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.075
You guys were good
together, you know?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.411
And then, next thing I know,

20:44.411 --> 20:45.978
I'm having to hire
a new secretary,

20:45.978 --> 20:48.114
'cause Didi decided
to run home to her mom.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.583
(chuckles) You sure there
wasn't, uh, someone else

20:50.583 --> 20:52.319
or something?
No, it's like I said,

20:52.319 --> 20:53.986
you know, it just
wasn't meant to be.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.324
I guess we pretty much
got what we can carry.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.758
Should probably head on back.
Aw, no.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.893
Come on, now, that's
all you can carry, Mr. NFL?

21:00.893 --> 21:01.894
Right. Okay.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.464
I guess I'm still
pretty weak today.

21:04.464 --> 21:08.067
Sad consequence
of a crazy night's drinking.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.569
Crazy night of drinking, huh?

21:09.569 --> 21:12.171
What, at home, just...?
(laughs): No, the Rammer Jammer.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.173
They had that
cocktail contest.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.042
Whoo! Yeah.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.648
* *

21:21.648 --> 21:23.650
I'm afraid to ask,
but I have to.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.485
Do any other surprises await us?

21:25.485 --> 21:27.920
Just the stuff
I bought online.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.323
What in the world?

21:30.323 --> 21:32.024
I'm sorry, is that candy?

21:32.024 --> 21:35.495
Edible undies--
they're like fruit
roll-ups you can wear.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.529
Magnolia Breeland!

21:36.529 --> 21:37.730
They're made of real fruit,

21:37.730 --> 21:38.898
so there's not
that many calories.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.434
My Lord, who knew
the sheer number

21:41.434 --> 21:45.171
of products that could assume
the shape of a man's privates?

21:45.171 --> 21:47.807
I know. Daddy's gonna get
some pretty weird spam

21:47.807 --> 21:49.041
in his e-mail.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.209
Um, I think those

21:50.209 --> 21:51.277
are straws.

21:51.277 --> 21:52.912
Stop looking at those.
Look away.

21:52.912 --> 21:56.115
Lemon will never know
about this, understand?

21:56.115 --> 21:57.550
We'll, just get rid of it all.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.985
It'll be our little secret.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.553
Oh, thanks for your help.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.122
It's okay; just throw it
in the garbage,

22:03.122 --> 22:04.857
first chance you get.

22:04.857 --> 22:05.658
Except for that.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.693
I'm gonna keep that.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.928
(horn honking rhythmically)

22:11.831 --> 22:15.101
DRIVER: This is the stop
you said to make, ma'am.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.135
Some sort of hunting camp?

22:16.135 --> 22:17.470
Yes, okay everyone.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.138
It'll only take me
a minute to find George,

22:19.138 --> 22:20.473
and then FloriBama here we come!

22:20.473 --> 22:22.675
Whoo-hoo!

22:26.345 --> 22:27.947
I have to go with her.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.349
She gets lost.

22:32.719 --> 22:33.853
I'll be right back,
I promise.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.922
Then we can finally
have that lunch.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.223
Maybe even dessert.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.291
Wait, that wasn't a metaphor;
I really meant dessert.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.127
What the hell
is going on here?

22:41.127 --> 22:43.430
Hey, um, Lemon has
to give George a message.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.632
No, I mean why are you
with my brother?

22:48.334 --> 22:49.902
Afternoon, Wade.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.573
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

22:58.811 --> 22:59.846
ZOE: How could you not tell me

22:59.846 --> 23:01.481
that Jesse was Wade's brother?

23:01.481 --> 23:03.716
Well, how could you go out
on a date with someone

23:03.716 --> 23:04.951
and not know their whole name?

23:04.951 --> 23:06.619
Well, I haven't even
gone on a date yet

23:06.619 --> 23:08.187
because I've been too busy
helping everyone

23:08.187 --> 23:09.456
with their problems.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.190
I didn't even know
Wade had a brother.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.992
Well, they don't talk.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.727
I don't know why,
and I don't care.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.129
But if you were so concerned
about what Wade thinks

23:17.129 --> 23:19.666
about you and Jesse, then
why don't you go ask him.
I'm not.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.300
Well, then, stop complaining.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.736
You're not the one who had to
interrupt her bachelorette party

23:23.736 --> 23:25.337
to go stomping through
the frickin' woods.

23:25.337 --> 23:28.741
Oh, I am so sorry if your affair
is inconveniencing you.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.209
The one that
you said was over.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.210
It was,

23:31.210 --> 23:32.411
okay?

23:32.411 --> 23:34.180
Lavon kissed me;
I did not kiss him back.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.816
And if George asks him,
he had better make that clear.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.223
Hey, look here.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.424
This one's still good.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.693
Great.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.795
Couple more, and we'll
all get one shot.

23:48.795 --> 23:52.098
I'll give Tom Long a running
start, just to be sporting.

23:55.401 --> 23:57.403
So, are we gonna talk

23:57.403 --> 23:59.572
about that other thing?
What other thing?

24:01.207 --> 24:02.341
Me being with Zoe.

24:02.341 --> 24:03.776
You seem pretty put out
about that.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.278
Look, I was just
surprised is all.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.180
I didn't know you two
knew each other.
Look,

24:08.180 --> 24:10.282
if you've got a problem with me
seeing her, I can step aside.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.218
No problem, no problem here.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.853
Well, all right.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.154
All right.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.956
(growling, clattering)

24:16.956 --> 24:18.591
(leaves rustling)

24:23.696 --> 24:25.665
I'll go check.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.867
Yeah, we'll both
check it out.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.305
(chuckles)

24:33.305 --> 24:35.174
Hey...

24:35.174 --> 24:36.475
Bear.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.312
Interesting line of work.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.281
You could say that, yeah.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.850
I think about trying
it myself.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.252
Can I ask how
you ended up in it?

24:46.252 --> 24:47.820
Usual, I guess.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.922
Rough childhood, Dad drank.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.491
Left home early,
drifted around.

24:52.491 --> 24:56.295
Well, you never know what you'll
do if you're hungry enough.

24:56.295 --> 24:59.298
I figured, hell, I take my
clothes off everyday anyway,

24:59.298 --> 25:00.700
why not get paid for doing it?

25:00.700 --> 25:02.935
Oh, I-I meant,
I meant driving a bus.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.872
Oh, Class C Commercial License.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.506
Cool.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.576
Hey, Tom.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.310
Too bad we don't have
some more ammo,

25:11.310 --> 25:12.478
seeing as how there's a bear

25:12.478 --> 25:13.479
in the camp.

25:13.479 --> 25:14.981
Oh, my.
Apparently,

25:14.981 --> 25:16.482
somebody left something real
tasty in the garbage outside,

25:16.482 --> 25:17.516
attracted a bear.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.651
Now I've got four friends

25:18.651 --> 25:20.186
out in the woods,
and only a handful

25:20.186 --> 25:21.320
of shells to fight it with.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.089
Everyone stay put.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.523
Especially you.

25:25.625 --> 25:29.195
Magnolia, did you throw
those edible undies...

25:29.195 --> 25:30.362
Mm-hmm, I did.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.100
Guess they were made
of real fruit.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.203
So, it must have been
a pretty wild night, huh?

25:37.203 --> 25:38.571
What was?

25:38.571 --> 25:40.707
Well, at the
Rammer Jammer.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.910
Oh... pretty crazy.

25:46.178 --> 25:50.216
'Cause I thought you would
have been all tucked in at home.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.552
No, not me.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.157
'Cause you know,

25:58.157 --> 26:00.893
Zoe said that she thought
she saw you there,

26:00.893 --> 26:03.095
you know, at the house.

26:05.464 --> 26:07.634
Oh, uh, yeah.

26:07.634 --> 26:08.968
Later.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.739
So, who all was there

26:12.739 --> 26:14.106
at the Rammer Jammer?

26:14.106 --> 26:15.307
Oh, about everyone.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.909
Wade, that band

26:16.909 --> 26:20.146
with the two hot girls,

26:20.146 --> 26:21.180
Shelley...

26:21.180 --> 26:21.781
Lemon?

26:22.782 --> 26:24.617
Was Lemon there?

26:24.617 --> 26:26.786
I think so, yeah.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.722
You think so or you know?

26:35.662 --> 26:37.596
You saw.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.799
Yeah, I did.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.703
Damn. Most of the shells are
for the 12-guages.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.037
Only one for the 16.

26:45.037 --> 26:45.672
Tell you what,

26:45.672 --> 26:46.673
I'll take the 12,

26:46.673 --> 26:47.774
go after the bear.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.408
You head out
and find the ladies,

26:49.408 --> 26:50.877
Lavon and George.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.311
And why would you
go after the bear?

26:52.311 --> 26:55.347
'Cause I'm a better shot
than you are, Wade.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.783
Says who?

26:56.783 --> 26:58.484
I don't know, whoever the hell
it is at the US Army

26:58.484 --> 26:59.752
gives out medals for it,
I guess.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.988
Oh, see, that was for
sharpshooting, Jesse.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.823
You know, where you're
laying on the ground

27:03.823 --> 27:05.224
with a scope,
no moving?

27:05.224 --> 27:06.959
You ever had a 500-pound
bear running at you?

27:06.959 --> 27:10.229
No, no, most of my attackers
were pretty heavily armed.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.665
Yeah, well,
I guess you're right.

27:12.665 --> 27:13.966
You know, it's
been almost an hour

27:13.966 --> 27:15.835
since I heard about
what a war hero you were.

27:15.835 --> 27:16.936
So go for it, war hero.

27:16.936 --> 27:17.970
Go chase after that bear.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.271
Take the guns,
take the shells.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.807
You know what, go ahead,
take care of yourself.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.008
It's what you always do.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.145
LEMON: Oh,

27:26.145 --> 27:27.479
we should have found
them by now.

27:27.479 --> 27:31.050
I mean, how much damn wood
do they need, anyway?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.518
Oh.

27:32.518 --> 27:33.552
You all right?

27:33.552 --> 27:34.586
Should we rest?

27:34.586 --> 27:36.588
No, I have to keep going.

27:36.588 --> 27:39.726
There's no telling
what Lavon told George already.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.660
Well, why would he
be saying anything?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.796
I mean, why would he
kiss you out of nowhere,

27:43.796 --> 27:45.231
if it was over
like you said.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.766
It makes no sense.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.701
I don't know.

27:48.701 --> 27:49.902
He just did.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.470
The door was closed.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.472
Yeah, how did it
open again?

27:53.472 --> 27:55.641
I don't know;
it just did.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.209
Did the wind
blow it or...?

27:57.209 --> 27:59.245
I did it, okay?

28:01.247 --> 28:02.614
I opened it.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.651
Just a little at Christmas.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.153
I went to him for comfort,

28:07.153 --> 28:09.488
and then by the time
I came to my senses,

28:09.488 --> 28:10.622
it was too late.

28:10.622 --> 28:13.525
And it's my fault, Zoe.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.028
I didn't tell George,
and now I'm gonna lose him,

28:16.028 --> 28:17.696
and it's all my fault.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.332
Maybe they haven't talked.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.103
My dad, he used to
always play golf.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.338
And he'd be out
there for hours.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.439
I remember asking him,

28:27.439 --> 28:29.842
"What do you guys talk
about that whole time?"

28:29.842 --> 28:31.377
And you know
what he said?

28:31.377 --> 28:32.912
He said golf.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.180
That's it.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.618
Well, maybe they're just...

28:39.618 --> 28:41.587
talking about firewood.

28:41.587 --> 28:44.123
Yeah, maybe they're
just talking about firewood.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.291
Yeah.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.226
GEORGE: You're supposed
to my friend, damn it!

28:47.226 --> 28:49.161
But probably not.
LAVON: I-I know.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.197
I know, and I shouldn't
have done it, George.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.198
I'm sorry.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.067
You're sorry
for kissing my fiancée?

28:55.067 --> 28:56.202
What the hell
were you thinking, Lavon?

28:56.202 --> 28:57.937
I don't,
I don't know.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.338
I had too much to drink,

28:59.338 --> 29:00.907
and I'm still upset
about Didi,

29:00.907 --> 29:02.875
like-like
you said, and...

29:02.875 --> 29:04.877
and I had a crush on Lemon.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.378
Look, I know
it was wrong.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.214
I was drunk,
and I wasn't thinking right,

29:08.214 --> 29:10.216
but she shut me down,
George, okay?

29:10.216 --> 29:11.317
She did nothing.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.551
This is all on me,

29:12.551 --> 29:13.786
LEMON:
That's not true.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.160
George.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.162
George.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.434
We need to talk.

29:30.636 --> 29:31.637
GEORGE:
 Lemon,

29:31.637 --> 29:33.005
Lemon, hey, hey.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.506
I don't understand why
we've got to talk

29:34.506 --> 29:36.508
about this all alone,
I mean, he needs to hear this.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.444
Okay? He's got to know that
he can't just kiss you.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.646
I don't care
how drunk he is, okay?
Yes...

29:40.646 --> 29:43.983
And I don't care what
the hell his feelings are.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.652
Okay? And why wouldn't
you tell me that

29:46.652 --> 29:49.155
he kissed you in
the first place?

29:49.155 --> 29:51.357
Because there was more.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.595
Wait a second, more?

29:56.595 --> 29:58.297
What more?

30:01.834 --> 30:04.436
George, Lavon and I
had an affair.

30:08.274 --> 30:09.942
A bear is going to
eat my sister.

30:09.942 --> 30:10.943
It is not; hush up.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.311
I messed this
all up, okay?

30:12.311 --> 30:13.880
She trusted me,
and I blew it.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.347
And now a bear

30:15.347 --> 30:16.248
is out there.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.417
I cannot just sit here
like a kid.

30:18.417 --> 30:19.518
I have to go help her.

30:19.518 --> 30:20.219
No.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.820
Trust me, if it comes down

30:21.820 --> 30:23.689
to Lemon and a bear,
I pity the bear.

30:23.689 --> 30:24.957
You are going to stay

30:24.957 --> 30:26.492
right here in this cabin.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.328
LAVON: I tried

30:29.328 --> 30:31.597
to stay out of things
with George and Lemon.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.932
I did.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.867
When he got back
from New York,

30:34.867 --> 30:37.636
I tried not to
feel like I felt.

30:37.636 --> 30:41.473
Kept hoping if I just acted
like I didn't feel it,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.509
eventually I wouldn't.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.212
I lost that battle.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.647
I mean, I know I did wrong.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.983
I was selfish,
I let people

30:50.983 --> 30:52.284
get hurt...

30:52.284 --> 30:53.252
So go ahead.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.121
If you want to say anything,
go ahead.

30:55.121 --> 30:56.422
I'm ready for it.

30:56.422 --> 30:57.556
Okay.

30:57.556 --> 31:01.527
This may be the worst first date
I have ever had.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.896
There, I said it.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.898
That hurt, didn't it?

31:05.898 --> 31:08.600
(laughter)

31:08.600 --> 31:10.802
Hm, Magnolia, do you play poker?

31:10.802 --> 31:12.604
I never have;
My mom once talked

31:12.604 --> 31:14.540
as if Satan himself
was dealing the cards,

31:14.540 --> 31:17.243
but it looks like fun.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.314
Lemon?

31:23.415 --> 31:26.218
Lemon!

31:26.218 --> 31:27.786
So then it's not about Zoe?

31:27.786 --> 31:29.855
Well, what the hell
is it, Wade?

31:29.855 --> 31:31.023
It's you, Jesse.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.424
Okay, great, hey, terrific.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.892
What about me?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.728
That's a real nice present you
got Crazy Earl for his birthday.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.964
But Dad needed a car.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.898
Is that what this is all about?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.300
Huh? You're jealous
I could afford it?

31:41.300 --> 31:43.902
You bought the
town drunk a car.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.837
Such a good son,

31:45.837 --> 31:48.007
Jesse, war hero returning home

31:48.007 --> 31:49.041
for his dad's birthday.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.442
What about every other day?

31:50.442 --> 31:52.211
Who's gonna be there to
take his keys from him?

31:52.211 --> 31:54.313
To bail him out of jail? Make
sure he doesn't kill someone

31:54.313 --> 31:55.681
with it?
Let me ask you a question.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.916
Why is it that every time
you say war hero,

31:57.916 --> 32:00.052
you say it like
you smelled something bad?

32:00.052 --> 32:02.054
Are you upset that I fought
for our country?

32:02.054 --> 32:03.755
Yeah, that's it.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.457
I could have fought, too.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.259
I stayed because
somebody had to.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.328
And you swoop in here,

32:09.328 --> 32:11.930
you buy gifts for Earl,
and then you leave.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.067
And you swoop in, and you take
a girl out you don't even know.

32:15.067 --> 32:17.803
And then you swoop on out,
and you leave her pining.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.405
"Oh, Jesse. Where's Jesse?"

32:19.405 --> 32:21.373
You're just a big swooper,
that's what you are.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.874
See, we're back to Zoe now.
You just swoop,

32:22.874 --> 32:24.510
swoop, swooping.
Why don't you just admit that
you

32:24.510 --> 32:26.012
don't want me to see her
'cause you like her?

32:26.012 --> 32:26.945
'Cause I don't!

32:26.945 --> 32:28.814
Okay.
Okay? I don't.

32:28.814 --> 32:31.383
'Cause she's just as snobbish

32:31.383 --> 32:33.885
and selfish and
superior as you are.

32:33.885 --> 32:34.953
So, you know what?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.122
Go with God, my friend.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.656
Y'all are perfect
for each other.

32:47.533 --> 32:51.103
Maybe this is
like an enchanted forest...

32:51.103 --> 32:53.305
only the opposite.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.785
LEMON: I'm really sorry

33:06.785 --> 33:10.489
that I didn't tell you, and you
had to find out like this.

33:10.489 --> 33:13.392
Why, uh...

33:13.392 --> 33:15.594
Why?
I don't know.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.365
You went to New York, and...

33:19.365 --> 33:21.267
and we weren't doing
that well before you left.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.634
You know what?
I said, "Come with me,"

33:22.634 --> 33:24.403
and you said you would,

33:24.403 --> 33:26.105
and then you kept
on putting it off.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.639
Because I told you
that I didn't want

33:27.639 --> 33:28.840
to live in New York,

33:28.840 --> 33:31.277
and you didn't listen to me
and you went anyway,

33:31.277 --> 33:33.312
okay, and that Christmas
I found out

33:33.312 --> 33:36.882
that my mom lived a town away
and that she didn't love me.

33:36.882 --> 33:37.883
Oh, so you felt unloved?

33:37.883 --> 33:39.551
Yes!
Well, I loved you!

33:40.786 --> 33:43.555
I loved you.

33:43.555 --> 33:44.656
(sobbing)

33:44.656 --> 33:48.660
I wasn't in my right mind,
George, okay?

33:48.660 --> 33:49.461
You were there,

33:49.461 --> 33:51.430
and Lavon was here...
Lav...

33:51.430 --> 33:56.402
...and then you came home
and it was like,

33:56.402 --> 33:57.903
like it never happened,

33:57.903 --> 34:02.308
and you were where you were
supposed to be and we,

34:02.308 --> 34:05.911
we were where we
belonged-- together.

34:05.911 --> 34:08.313
So is that what you want?

34:08.313 --> 34:09.681
You want Lavon,
is that it?

34:09.681 --> 34:12.050
God, no. George,
it's like I don't even,

34:12.050 --> 34:13.418
I don't even
remember it.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.687
It's like I-I-I was
like a different person.

34:15.687 --> 34:18.757
Okay?

34:18.757 --> 34:19.757
Listen to me,

34:19.757 --> 34:22.860
the time was so brief

34:22.860 --> 34:26.232
it was so brief in the grand
scheme of our lives,

34:26.232 --> 34:28.065
in the years
and years

34:28.065 --> 34:29.467
that we have spent
together

34:29.467 --> 34:32.603
and the time that we have
together in the future.

34:32.603 --> 34:36.542
I am so sorry that
I didn't tell you before

34:36.542 --> 34:38.944
and I cannot tell you
how truly,

34:38.944 --> 34:42.880
truly, truly sorry I am.

34:42.880 --> 34:47.085
Well, you don't have
to... Lemon, you don't.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.188
I don't?

34:50.188 --> 34:52.524
No, you don't
'cause it's over.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.393
Yes, I swear to you,
it is over.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.128
I promise you,
it will never, ever,

34:56.128 --> 34:57.729
ever, ever
happen again.
Lemon,

34:57.729 --> 34:59.831
Lemon.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.903
I meant us.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.105
It's over.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.876
Wait, George, no.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.348
George, no.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.852
George.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.858
(door opens, engine idling)

35:26.858 --> 35:28.327
(door slams loudly)

35:29.195 --> 35:31.397
(engine revving)

35:36.168 --> 35:38.404
What was that back there?

35:38.404 --> 35:41.573
Don't know what you're
talking about, Doc.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.141
Do you really think that
about me--

35:43.141 --> 35:45.477
that I am, am snobbish
and shallow?

35:47.045 --> 35:49.047
Yeah, yeah, I do.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.916
Because you are wrong.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.451
Oh?

35:52.451 --> 35:54.420
Well, let's see
what's caught your eye

35:54.420 --> 35:56.388
since you've been
in BlueBell, Doc.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.624
There's been Judson--
veterinarian,

35:58.624 --> 36:02.160
George-- lawyer, and now
there's, there's Jesse

36:02.160 --> 36:04.363
the, uh, the
eco-geo-whatever.

36:04.363 --> 36:07.933
Careers,
prospects, money.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.369
That is just a coincidence.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.470
Okay?
It's not,

36:11.470 --> 36:15.307
Doc, it's nature
of the beast.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.209
Prefer to keep the company
of your own kind.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.245
Embrace it.

36:19.245 --> 36:21.213
It's good to know.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.214
W...

36:22.214 --> 36:25.217
(sighs)

36:25.217 --> 36:27.586
Hey.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.922
Hey.
Uh, George had to
go deal with his dad,

36:30.922 --> 36:33.925
I guess, but, uh, I was able
to get one of his buddies

36:33.925 --> 36:35.294
to give us
a ride back,

36:35.294 --> 36:37.596
so you and I can
finally have that meal.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.365
All I've eaten is a
pair of edible undies

36:39.365 --> 36:41.367
I found on the ground.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.569
Not bad, though,
real fruit.

36:44.670 --> 36:49.441
Look, Jesse, I,
I just don't think I can.

36:51.410 --> 36:55.547
I can't always stay
out of people's business,

36:55.547 --> 36:58.550
but when I can,
I probably should.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.823
(clattering)

37:04.823 --> 37:07.659
Oh.

37:09.127 --> 37:11.963
Yeah.

37:11.963 --> 37:15.267
Yeah, probably.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.408
Wade. (chuckles)

37:22.408 --> 37:25.911
Wadester, you think I could
get a ride back to my car?

37:25.911 --> 37:28.280
You walked in, Tom,
you can walk out.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.750
Yeah, but
th-there's a bear.

37:33.151 --> 37:35.153
Good point.

37:35.153 --> 37:36.488
(cocks gun)

37:37.323 --> 37:39.525
See you
back in town, Tom.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.828
(door closes)

37:42.828 --> 37:44.029
Oh, my.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.101
Oh, Lemon.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.771
(sobs)

37:52.771 --> 37:55.574
Lemon, people wanted
to get on the bus.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.548
(sobs)

38:02.548 --> 38:05.851
Magnolia, what am I ever
going to tell them?

38:05.851 --> 38:07.853
These are your friends;
they'll understand.

38:07.853 --> 38:11.557
And whenever I was upset and
you had to make me feel better,

38:11.557 --> 38:13.325
you know what you told me?

38:13.325 --> 38:15.794
You said
Breeland girls are strong.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.629
We are, huh?

38:17.629 --> 38:20.799
Yeah, and we don't quit,

38:20.799 --> 38:23.068
and no one can keep us down,
right?

38:23.068 --> 38:25.471
Right.

38:25.471 --> 38:28.740
Lemon... I am
your maid of honor

38:28.740 --> 38:31.377
and I will do
everything for you.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.644
I can call people for you,

38:32.644 --> 38:34.346
and you don't have
to do anything, okay?

38:34.346 --> 38:37.115
(sighs)

38:37.115 --> 38:38.216
(sniffs)

38:38.216 --> 38:42.688
Oh, Magnolia,
you are... so right.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.824
I am strong.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.058
You are.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.360
(chuckles)

38:48.360 --> 38:50.496
Thank you.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.330
So, what are you waiting for?

38:52.330 --> 38:53.632
Call the girls.
Let's party!

38:54.466 --> 38:56.067
Wait, Lemon,
you don't need

38:56.067 --> 38:58.670
to have a party you don't want
for a wedding that's off.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.305
(laughs)

39:00.305 --> 39:03.074
Sweetheart,
there is nothing off.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.676
George Tucker
is just...

39:04.676 --> 39:08.880
He's upset, but h-he needs time,
that's all.

39:08.880 --> 39:13.952
He'll come around... so
don't you worry about a thing.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.388
Okay?

39:16.388 --> 39:19.925
Because I...
am marrying George Tucker.

39:19.925 --> 39:23.161
Whoo-hoo!
Yes, you are, all right!

39:23.161 --> 39:24.162
Whoo!

39:24.162 --> 39:25.163
Okay, too much.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.732
(Lemon laughs)

39:26.732 --> 39:27.533
All right!

39:27.533 --> 39:30.001
Whoo, get on
this bus, whoo!

39:32.771 --> 39:35.774
* *

39:43.915 --> 39:45.917
George.

39:47.653 --> 39:49.655
You want
to come inside?

39:49.655 --> 39:53.391
No... I'm not gonna
be here very long.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.994
I don't know
what happened exactly,

39:55.994 --> 39:57.696
but the way you tore
out of there...

39:57.696 --> 39:58.897
Zoe, you lied to me.

39:59.698 --> 40:03.969
I did and I'm really sorry.

40:10.341 --> 40:13.144
(sighs)

40:13.144 --> 40:14.279
How long
have you known?

40:14.279 --> 40:15.280
Not long.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.414
(scoffs)

40:16.414 --> 40:17.849
Yeah, long enough
to keep me walking

40:17.849 --> 40:19.417
around this town
looking like a fool?

40:19.417 --> 40:22.187
No one thinks that
you're a fool, George.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.189
Oh, yeah.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.190
I do.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.758
No one else
even knew...

40:26.758 --> 40:29.928
Yeah, but you knew,
Zoe, you knew.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.263
And I hated it.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.866
I didn't want to be in
the middle of all of this.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.735
Look, you're
my friend, but

40:36.735 --> 40:39.037
Lavon is my friend, too,
and I did what I had to do

40:39.037 --> 40:42.307
to protect all of my
friends, and this happened.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.075
(clicks tongue)

40:44.075 --> 40:45.677
Yeah, no, I, uh...

40:45.677 --> 40:47.078
You know what?
I get it.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.947
You do?

40:48.947 --> 40:49.748
Good.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.883
I understand,
yeah,

40:51.883 --> 40:54.853
except one thing--
we're not friends.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.489
You see, I thought
that we were,

40:57.489 --> 41:00.959
but now I know
that we're not.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.562
George.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.831
George, come on.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.200
(truck door opens and closes)

41:09.200 --> 41:11.202
(truck driving away)
