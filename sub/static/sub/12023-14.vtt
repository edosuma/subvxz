Male narrator: Tonight
on Ice Road Truckers...

00:02.672 --> 00:04.171
All right, I'm ready to roll.

00:04.173 --> 00:05.473
Busting hump, man.

00:05.475 --> 00:07.008
Working these long hours.

00:07.010 --> 00:09.477
Narrator: The battle for the
load count lead puts every

00:09.479 --> 00:11.545
driver in the line of fire.

00:11.547 --> 00:13.381
Maybe they need to come down to
the Lower 48 and learn how to

00:13.383 --> 00:15.516
drive a real truck.

00:15.518 --> 00:17.518
Oh, shit!

00:17.520 --> 00:21.789
Narrator: - They'll have to dig deep...
- I need to get loads, man.

00:21.791 --> 00:24.058
It's all about loads right now.

00:24.060 --> 00:29.297
Narrator: - Or give up...
- Ten years I've been doing this.

00:29.299 --> 00:32.133
That's the first time I've
lost anything off my load.

00:32.134 --> 00:34.936
Narrator: And be lucky
just to survive.

00:34.938 --> 00:38.839
My dangerous goods are
shaking all over.

Narrator: Far north of
the Arctic Circle...

01:15.945 --> 01:22.483
At the end of the Dempster highway...
Alex Debogorski's in early for

01:22.485 --> 01:25.353
his next assignment.

01:25.355 --> 01:27.188
Morning, Mike.

01:27.190 --> 01:28.823
Hey, good morning, Alex.

01:28.825 --> 01:30.558
I guess you're
looking for a load?

01:30.560 --> 01:31.359
Yes, sir.

01:31.361 --> 01:33.260
Do I ever have a
nice one for you.

01:33.328 --> 01:34.161
Very good.

01:34.163 --> 01:35.096
What is it?

01:35.098 --> 01:36.931
I have a load, uh,
going to Whitehorse.

01:36.933 --> 01:43.771
It's got about 5,000 kilos of different
gases, so it's a dangerous load.

01:43.839 --> 01:48.542
So you wanna be careful
and not take any chances.

01:48.544 --> 01:51.579
Because if some of these get
damaged, there might not be

01:51.581 --> 01:58.719
enough pieces of you
to put in a body bag.

01:58.721 --> 02:01.989
As you can see, I put
two skids on that side.

02:01.991 --> 02:05.259
It's just to keep it from
sliding from side to side.

02:05.261 --> 02:07.828
Narrator: Alex is heading south
with a volatile mixture of

02:07.830 --> 02:12.533
compressed gases used in welding
and construction projects.

02:12.535 --> 02:16.537
Everything is in cages,
and it's all strapped in.

02:16.539 --> 02:18.539
Gonna tighten this
one up a little bit?

02:18.541 --> 02:19.874
Sure.

02:19.876 --> 02:21.342
There.

02:21.344 --> 02:24.111
Because it's compressed gas,
there's a valve in there, and if

02:24.113 --> 02:28.049
you knock off that valve, this
thing would be like a torpedo.

02:28.051 --> 02:29.683
Yep.

02:29.685 --> 02:34.688
It will go through a
2 to 3-foot wall.

02:40.462 --> 02:46.667
I got 5,000 kgs of mixed gases--
Acetylene, helium, oxygen.

02:46.669 --> 02:48.035
Well, hell, some of them burn.

02:48.103 --> 02:50.304
Some of them, you mix them,
they'll blow up, and some will

02:50.306 --> 02:52.606
just make you quack like a duck.

02:52.707 --> 02:56.410
Narrator: He has to haul the
deadly load through recently

02:56.412 --> 03:02.049
reopened Hurricane Alley...
where high winds can easily blow

03:02.051 --> 03:06.887
a big rig off the road.

03:06.889 --> 03:09.824
Going through the pass has
been a problem this season

03:09.826 --> 03:13.360
because of the weather being so
unstable, and I'm gonna do it

03:13.362 --> 03:20.034
one more time with probably the most
dangerous load I've had this season.

03:20.036 --> 03:21.769
Anything could happen today.

03:26.074 --> 03:31.779
Narrator: While Alex
battles mother nature...

03:31.781 --> 03:36.884
- 400 miles away in Alaska...
- Oh, fuck!

03:36.886 --> 03:40.287
Narrator: Two of the Dalton's top
truckers are battling each other.

03:40.289 --> 03:42.756
Wanna get this thing
moving and lead the pack.

03:42.758 --> 03:44.592
I'm here first, I get
the fucking load.

03:44.594 --> 03:49.230
Narrator: - Haul road ace Jack Jessee...
- Sweet as my mama's pecan pie.

03:49.232 --> 03:52.500
Narrator: And Rocky Mountain
log hauler Darrell Ward...

03:52.502 --> 03:54.335
I am the best there is.

03:54.337 --> 03:56.504
Like a fucking freight train.

03:56.506 --> 03:58.339
Well, fuck, you get a load.

03:58.341 --> 04:01.675
Narrator: Are locked at the
top of the leaderboard.

04:01.677 --> 04:06.380
They've got just ten days left
in the season, and only one can

04:06.382 --> 04:09.483
be king of the haul road.

04:09.485 --> 04:12.853
It's time somebody puts
ol' Jack in his place.

04:12.855 --> 04:14.054
I've been number one.

04:14.056 --> 04:15.389
I am number one.

04:15.391 --> 04:16.923
And I'm gonna stay number one.

04:16.926 --> 04:19.026
Let's get outta here.

04:19.028 --> 04:21.562
Narrator: 8:00 A.M.
at the Carlile yard.

04:21.564 --> 04:24.231
Get hooked up, and I'm gone.

04:24.233 --> 04:27.835
Narrator: Darrell Ward's
got the jump on Jack.

04:27.837 --> 04:31.305
They sure as hell don't give
you much room in here to work

04:31.307 --> 04:32.940
your landing gear.

04:32.942 --> 04:36.143
It's a good thing I've
been hitting the gym.

04:36.145 --> 04:40.814
Not just any man can
pull that shit off.

04:40.816 --> 04:44.051
Narrator: The Montana legend is
hauling a reefer van of food

04:44.053 --> 04:46.086
for the oil fields.

04:46.088 --> 04:50.257
I'm gonna be running all night long
to get this load up to Prudhoe Bay.

04:50.325 --> 04:52.459
You know, it's gotta be
maintained to 42 degrees.

04:52.527 --> 04:55.095
Every load counts, even
a load of groceries.

04:55.097 --> 04:56.163
We're coming down to the wire.

04:56.165 --> 05:00.568
It's the end of the ice
road season, you know.

05:00.570 --> 05:03.003
I don't see why there's any
reason I can't beat Jack.

05:03.005 --> 05:04.905
I'm pretty stiff competition.

05:04.907 --> 05:07.641
You know, I came up here
to do this for Reno.

05:07.643 --> 05:10.344
You know, his comfort is
very important to me.

05:10.346 --> 05:11.712
I miss him a lot.

05:11.714 --> 05:15.182
Anything I do, I do for him.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.918
All right, I'm ready to roll.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.921
Off on another journey.

05:20.923 --> 05:23.891
Narrator: While Darrell chases
the load count lead...

05:23.893 --> 05:28.162
Carlile's newest heavy hauler
is on a mission of his own.

05:28.164 --> 05:29.196
Doing good.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.497
I got a good rest.

05:30.499 --> 05:35.135
Ready to head on up the road.

05:35.137 --> 05:38.172
Narrator: Austin Wheeler's only
one load off the top spot

05:38.174 --> 05:42.109
after a string of
successful heavy hauls.

05:42.111 --> 05:44.478
The end of the
season's coming up.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.013
Pressure's on.

05:46.081 --> 05:49.483
There's still a lot of loads to
get up the road, so I'm gonna

05:49.485 --> 05:53.487
try and get as many loads up the
road as we can before the ice melts.

05:53.555 --> 05:57.925
We'll put flags on the
corner of the trailer.

05:57.927 --> 06:03.130
Narrator: Austin's hauling a massive
60,000-pound front end loader.

06:03.132 --> 06:05.399
I love doing heavy haul.

06:05.401 --> 06:09.536
Hauling equipment like this is my
favorite type of trucking to do.

06:09.538 --> 06:11.272
That's a really nice one.

06:11.274 --> 06:12.740
It looks pretty brand-new.

06:12.742 --> 06:15.743
There's not a scratch on the
bucket or nothing, so we wanna

06:15.745 --> 06:18.679
try to take care of it when
we get it up to Prudhoe Bay.

06:18.681 --> 06:21.181
We got a very small window of
time to get this up north, so

06:21.183 --> 06:24.118
we'll get it there
as fast as we can.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.387
Narrator: Despite the
challenging load, Austin's got

06:26.389 --> 06:29.957
to deliver it in a single day to
keep his chance of winning the

06:29.959 --> 06:32.359
load count alive.

06:32.361 --> 06:37.097
All right, let's
get out of here.

06:37.099 --> 06:39.667
Narrator: While other drivers
scramble to get ahead...

06:39.669 --> 06:42.202
Let's run in and
see what they got.

06:42.204 --> 06:44.938
Narrator: Jack's working
at his own pace.

06:44.940 --> 06:47.074
Hopefully, it's quick.

06:47.076 --> 06:48.175
I need to get loads, man.

06:48.177 --> 06:49.910
It's all about loads right now.

06:49.912 --> 06:53.580
Narrator: The ace is late to the
yard, but he's leading the

06:53.582 --> 06:56.884
load count.

06:56.985 --> 06:58.252
I see some pipe in the yard.

06:58.254 --> 07:00.154
I hope I don't get pipe.

07:00.156 --> 07:04.358
I know it's gotta go,
but I don't like pipe.

07:04.459 --> 07:09.330
Narrator: Pipe is one of the least
desired loads on the haul road.

07:09.332 --> 07:13.300
The rigid pipes make for a rough
ride that can damage trucks and

07:13.302 --> 07:19.773
drivers if they
don't take it slow.

07:19.775 --> 07:21.408
Morning, Mark.

07:21.410 --> 07:22.810
Jack, what's going on?

07:22.812 --> 07:24.545
Um, I wanna go to Prudhoe.

07:24.547 --> 07:25.612
Good for you.

07:25.614 --> 07:26.447
What do you got?

07:26.449 --> 07:28.449
I got a load of pipe.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.784
Don't want it.

07:30.786 --> 07:32.619
So you wanna make it difficult.

07:32.687 --> 07:35.089
Well, I mean, I had to bobtail
back... this last trip.

07:35.091 --> 07:37.057
I was hoping for something
a little better than pipe.

07:37.059 --> 07:39.593
You're not the only guy
that had to bobtail back.

07:39.595 --> 07:42.529
No, but I'm probably one of the more
senior guys that had to bobtail back.

07:42.531 --> 07:44.865
Well, you might be one of the
more senior guys that had to

07:44.867 --> 07:46.934
bobtail back, but I got
good news for you, Jack.

07:46.936 --> 07:47.868
What's that?

07:47.870 --> 07:49.770
You don't have to
bobtail out of here.

07:49.772 --> 07:53.941
[Laughing]

07:53.943 --> 07:59.046
Least I ain't bobtailing
like Mark said.

07:59.048 --> 08:03.183
But if pipe's all they got,
pipe's what I'll take.

08:03.185 --> 08:07.788
Narrator: Even though the
load will slow him down...

08:07.790 --> 08:11.959
it's the one he's got to haul
to keep the load count lead.

08:11.961 --> 08:15.229
Gotta check all these straps.

08:15.231 --> 08:19.767
Pipe is very dangerous
if it's not done right.

08:19.769 --> 08:22.202
Well, everything looks good.

08:22.204 --> 08:26.206
Checked for leaks,
lights, brakes, rear.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.908
We're outta here.

08:35.150 --> 08:39.119
Narrator: - Back in the office...
- I told you in the beginning

08:39.121 --> 08:41.221
his learning curve was
gonna be a lot longer.

08:41.322 --> 08:46.260
We've made that investment in a
driver, and yet we're still

08:46.262 --> 08:50.063
15, 16 trips in with the guy,
which is twice as long as

08:50.065 --> 08:54.134
anybody else, and we still don't
feel like we can cut him loose.

08:54.202 --> 08:57.704
Narrator: The boss is getting
the rundown on Porkchop from

08:57.706 --> 09:01.942
- Phil Kromm...
- I'm gonna be sneaky.

09:01.944 --> 09:04.211
[Giggles]

09:04.213 --> 09:06.513
What are you doing?

09:06.515 --> 09:09.716
Narrator: After the veteran
trainer spent last trip watching

09:09.718 --> 09:12.252
over the troubled rookie.

09:12.254 --> 09:15.856
Bottom line is sometimes he's
driving way too fast and other

09:15.858 --> 09:18.792
times he's dragging his ass.

09:18.794 --> 09:21.195
You know, we got a lot left to
do in a short amount of time to

09:21.197 --> 09:24.064
finish the season, and I don't
know if he's... gonna be worth,

09:24.066 --> 09:27.534
you know, keeping in a truck
that somebody else could be

09:27.536 --> 09:29.336
pulling more loads with.

09:29.437 --> 09:31.805
It gets to a point where, you
know, a guy's out there for long

09:31.807 --> 09:36.210
enough... if he's not getting
it, then he may not get it.

09:36.277 --> 09:37.110
Okay.

09:37.112 --> 09:38.045
All right?

09:38.047 --> 09:38.879
See you in a couple days.

09:38.881 --> 09:39.780
All right, later.

09:39.782 --> 09:42.883
Thanks, Phil.

09:42.885 --> 09:47.493
It's my decision to make sure
that we get all these loads booked,

09:47.772 --> 09:50.707
and that we get it done, you know,
as efficiently as we can.

09:50.971 --> 09:53.799
And safely. And, so...
I got a tough decision to make today.

09:55.965 --> 09:57.631
Well, let's see what
they got for me.

09:57.732 --> 09:59.800
Weather's getting a little bit
on the warm side, so it's gonna

09:59.802 --> 10:01.602
take a little bit longer today.

10:01.703 --> 10:04.471
Whew! I hope it's a good load.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.506
What's going on today, Mark?

10:05.508 --> 10:06.773
Oh, not much.

10:06.775 --> 10:08.208
Just another happy day.

10:08.210 --> 10:09.376
I hear you, man.

10:09.378 --> 10:10.377
How are you?

10:10.379 --> 10:12.279
Ready for this last
push on the haul road.

10:12.281 --> 10:15.048
- Get it over with, so...
- You need to go see Lane

10:15.050 --> 10:20.587
before I can get you-- get
you a load out of here.

10:20.589 --> 10:22.222
All right.

10:22.224 --> 10:24.491
Back to the principal's office.

10:24.493 --> 10:28.562
[Clears throat]

10:28.564 --> 10:30.731
[Knocks at door]

10:30.733 --> 10:33.300
What'd I do this time?

10:33.302 --> 10:34.868
Come on in and sit down.

10:42.443 --> 10:45.913
Narrator: - Coming up...
- Whoa, boy!

10:45.915 --> 10:49.850
Narrator: Alex returns
to Hurricane Alley.

10:49.852 --> 10:52.386
- And later...
- Ah, damn it!

10:52.388 --> 10:54.855
Narrator: Austin pushes
it to the limit.

10:57.051 --> 11:00.453
Narrator: At Carlile's Fairbanks terminal...
[Tapping on door]

11:00.455 --> 11:01.354
Hey, come on in.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.522
What's up, boss man?

11:02.524 --> 11:03.723
Have a seat.

11:03.725 --> 11:04.991
All righty.

11:04.993 --> 11:08.995
Narrator: Porkchop's been
called to the boss's office.

11:09.063 --> 11:14.301
Where do you feel like
you're at out there?

11:14.402 --> 11:15.836
Road's different every day.

11:15.838 --> 11:17.838
I can do whatever
you need me to do.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.573
I told you I come
up here to work.

11:19.575 --> 11:20.574
That's what I'm here for.

11:20.675 --> 11:23.844
Well... ahem.

11:23.945 --> 11:26.146
I've been having some
conversations with some guys,

11:26.148 --> 11:30.750
and obviously you and I have
talked several times too, so...

11:30.752 --> 11:34.621
There's a con-- a strong
contingent of drivers, peers out

11:34.623 --> 11:42.062
there, that, uh, you're not, uh,
coming along like you should.

11:42.064 --> 11:45.498
We've been doing it for several
weeks now, and it doesn't seem

11:45.500 --> 11:50.203
to me like the
opinions are changing.

11:50.205 --> 11:53.273
And, uh, there's-- there's
always a learning curve.

11:53.275 --> 11:54.174
We understand that.

11:54.176 --> 11:57.611
We go above and beyond to make
sure that we give everybody

11:57.613 --> 12:01.648
the opportunity, but I have to
learn to-- when it's time to cut

12:01.650 --> 12:04.017
our losses and cut our risk.

12:04.019 --> 12:07.787
I guess... what I'm thinking,
Porkchop, is that I'd like to,

12:07.789 --> 12:11.725
uh, separate today.

12:11.727 --> 12:19.900
And, uh, we'll get you sent back
home, uh, to mom and the kids.

12:19.902 --> 12:22.502
Obviously, the skill set that
you have fits down there,

12:22.504 --> 12:23.603
and that's great.

12:23.605 --> 12:26.273
Um, it just doesn't seem
to be working here.

12:26.275 --> 12:28.008
Oh, hey, I made a
good run at it.

12:28.010 --> 12:30.443
You did make a hell
of a run at it.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.544
All right, man.

12:31.546 --> 12:32.379
All right.

12:32.381 --> 12:33.179
Thank you, sir.

12:33.181 --> 12:33.980
Ahem.

12:33.982 --> 12:34.714
Thanks, Porkchop.

12:34.716 --> 12:35.448
Have a good one.

12:35.450 --> 12:39.719
All right.

12:39.721 --> 12:42.689
Ahh.

12:42.691 --> 12:45.525
Ah, he just said I wasn't doing
my job right, didn't learn

12:45.527 --> 12:46.893
the road quick enough.

12:46.895 --> 12:49.129
Maybe they need to come down
to the lower 48 and learn how

12:49.131 --> 12:50.196
to drive a real truck.

12:50.198 --> 12:52.632
Then they can come up here and
say they're truck drivers.

12:52.634 --> 12:53.633
You know?

12:53.635 --> 12:57.804
Fuck'em.

12:57.806 --> 12:59.439
I'm not sorry to see him go.

12:59.441 --> 13:02.409
There was too much inconsistency,
and when it comes

13:02.411 --> 13:04.177
down to it, we're still
running a business here.

13:04.179 --> 13:05.645
It's not a charity.

13:05.647 --> 13:11.718
And Porkchop just
wasn't getting it done.

13:11.720 --> 13:15.822
My biggest problem since I've
been up here was, I guess,

13:15.824 --> 13:17.891
Lane and Phil in collaboration.

13:17.893 --> 13:19.159
Well, you know what?

13:19.161 --> 13:21.561
It's amazing how clean-cut Lane
is, 'cause you'd figure with

13:21.563 --> 13:23.830
a man like that being up my ass
the whole time, he'd have

13:23.832 --> 13:27.968
a little bit of shit on him.

13:27.970 --> 13:31.171
To be honest with you, I'm going
home with my head held high.

13:31.173 --> 13:33.006
I got a good conscience.

13:33.008 --> 13:33.873
I did my job.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.542
I did it to the best
of my abilities.

13:35.544 --> 13:37.177
Same thing I teach my kids.

13:37.179 --> 13:40.914
If you know you did your best, don't
let anybody else tell you different.

13:40.916 --> 13:44.184
Narrator: Porkchop's exit leaves
an opening on the Carlile

13:44.186 --> 13:48.455
roster, and with dozens of loads
still to haul before the end of

13:48.457 --> 13:52.892
the season, there's no
more time for rookies.

13:52.894 --> 13:53.994
We're up against it now.

13:53.996 --> 13:56.896
If it means letting somebody go
to bring somebody else in that

13:56.898 --> 13:59.099
can haul those extra loads and
get that done, somebody that's

13:59.101 --> 14:02.502
got some experience, then that's the
decision we gotta make to get this done.

14:02.504 --> 14:08.675
Narrator: So Lane's
called in a closer.

14:08.677 --> 14:11.878
All these new guys are caught
up in about being the best.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.079
I've already been there.

14:13.081 --> 14:14.614
I am the best.

14:14.616 --> 14:18.718
Narrator: Ray Veilleux has
already conquered the haul road.

14:18.720 --> 14:23.857
Two years ago, he hit the Dalton as a
rookie without a penny to his name.

14:23.859 --> 14:25.625
It's all business now.

14:25.627 --> 14:27.627
No more-- no more
messing around.

14:27.629 --> 14:32.399
Narrator: And when it was all
over, he was the load count king.

14:32.401 --> 14:35.335
How's that for
rookie shit, huh?

14:35.337 --> 14:36.336
Back.

14:36.338 --> 14:37.170
I'm back.

14:37.172 --> 14:37.971
You ready to go back to work?

14:37.973 --> 14:38.805
I'm ready to work.

14:38.807 --> 14:40.173
Good, good.

14:40.175 --> 14:41.608
Calling from the bench, man.

14:41.610 --> 14:42.442
Perfect.

14:42.444 --> 14:43.143
I'm here for you.

14:43.145 --> 14:43.877
I'll get it done.

14:43.879 --> 14:44.611
All right, man.

14:44.613 --> 14:45.445
All right.

14:45.447 --> 14:46.146
Glad to have you back.

14:46.148 --> 14:46.813
Awesome.

14:46.815 --> 14:47.881
Thanks, Ray.

14:47.883 --> 14:50.483
Narrator: After two years
working close to home in

14:50.485 --> 14:54.220
the Lower 48, the offer to
help close out the season was

14:54.222 --> 14:58.224
too good to pass up.

14:58.292 --> 15:01.127
I was back at home, got
a phone call from Lane.

15:01.129 --> 15:03.463
I got on the first
flight, and here I am.

15:03.531 --> 15:06.266
I'm coming up here with one goal,
and that's to move as many

15:06.268 --> 15:12.038
loads as I can before
the end of the season.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.407
I'm hooking up the air
lines, my lights.

15:14.409 --> 15:15.942
We're pinned in pretty good.

15:15.944 --> 15:17.377
I tugged against the trailer.

15:17.379 --> 15:20.814
Narrator: Ray's hauling a
25,000-pound elbow pipe,

15:20.816 --> 15:25.819
critical for an oil rig
project in Prudhoe Bay.

15:25.821 --> 15:27.320
My season starts today.

15:27.322 --> 15:34.294
I don't have a whole lot of time,
but I'm gonna haul a lot of loads.

15:34.296 --> 15:36.129
Feels pretty good.

15:36.131 --> 15:39.032
I just gotta get in the swing
of things, pick it back up.

15:39.034 --> 15:42.001
There's no way anybody would
really want to pass this up.

15:42.003 --> 15:47.807
If somebody asks you to go run the
haul road, you jump all over it.

15:47.809 --> 15:50.376
This is awesome.

15:50.378 --> 15:56.549
Narrator: 2,200 miles to the southeast...
[Horn honks]

15:56.551 --> 16:01.254
Rick Yemm, Hugh Rowland, and
Vlad Pleskot barrel through

16:01.256 --> 16:04.557
the rugged winter roads.

16:04.559 --> 16:05.925
No one fucking listens.

16:05.927 --> 16:08.194
I will not travel
these roads alone.

16:08.196 --> 16:11.131
Narrator: And things aren't
going well between Rick and

16:11.133 --> 16:12.665
the Polar Bear.

16:12.733 --> 16:15.001
Yeah, when he's happy, he's a
rock star, and when he's not

16:15.003 --> 16:17.837
happy, he's sitting there
stewing, he's mad.

16:17.905 --> 16:22.008
He's just a fucker.

16:22.010 --> 16:27.847
Narrator: Last run, Hugh left Rick
behind to get a jump on his delivery.

16:27.849 --> 16:33.286
That's what happens when you sleep in till
the sunshine burns a hole in your ass.

16:33.288 --> 16:36.189
You get behind.

16:36.191 --> 16:38.725
Well, if it's solo trucking,
I'm just gonna go-- I'm just

16:38.727 --> 16:41.628
gonna go back, 'cause that's
not what I signed up for.

16:41.630 --> 16:44.898
Narrator: Now Rick's still
fuming as he heads to the

16:44.900 --> 16:48.902
village of Pauingassi with
a load of cement bags.

16:48.969 --> 16:51.104
I'll fuck off, go by myself.

16:51.172 --> 16:58.111
Narrator: And he's putting the hammer
down... for a little payback.

16:58.113 --> 17:00.213
I'll just toodle
my way up there.

17:00.215 --> 17:02.182
I can drive in the bush
by myself perfectly fine.

17:17.531 --> 17:22.001
See, when I'm hotheaded,
I can't fucking think.

17:22.002 --> 17:23.102
Whoa!

17:23.104 --> 17:28.575
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck,
oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

17:28.577 --> 17:31.611
What?

17:39.220 --> 17:41.621
Man, did I fuck it up here?

17:47.761 --> 17:49.696
Fuck, lost a bag.

17:49.698 --> 17:52.031
My very back bag.

17:52.033 --> 17:53.900
None of these were really
put on all that great.

17:53.902 --> 17:56.869
I tightened 'em as much as I could,
but that's all I could do.

17:56.871 --> 18:01.441
Narrator: The lost bag of cement
weighs over 3,000 pounds.

18:01.443 --> 18:05.778
Rick's gotta find a way to
get it back on the truck.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.413
Nothing I can do about it.

18:07.415 --> 18:13.586
I can't pick on of these up by hand, so...
Nothing I can do about it.

18:13.588 --> 18:15.622
Narrator: Or not.

18:21.595 --> 18:22.395
I knew better.

18:22.397 --> 18:24.430
Should've been double-strapped.

18:24.432 --> 18:26.666
That's ten years I've
been doing this.

18:26.668 --> 18:28.601
That's the first time I've
lost anything off my load.

18:28.603 --> 18:30.436
It's a fucking giant bag.

18:30.438 --> 18:33.339
If it was little bags, I'd go
back and pick 'em up, but I

18:33.341 --> 18:35.675
can't fucking pick
up a giant bag.

18:35.677 --> 18:37.844
Shit happens.

18:43.450 --> 18:46.286
Narrator: 2,000 miles
to the northwest...

18:48.856 --> 18:51.557
I'm southbound on the
Dempster highway, going to

18:51.559 --> 18:53.860
Whitehorse with a load
of dangerous goods.

18:53.862 --> 19:00.033
Narrator: Alex Debogorski's headed south
with a potentially explosive haul.

19:00.035 --> 19:04.170
I am hauling a mixed load
with a bunch of cylinders of

19:04.172 --> 19:06.439
different compressed gases.

19:06.441 --> 19:08.174
Its very cold today.

19:08.176 --> 19:09.642
Its minus 40.

19:09.710 --> 19:13.579
And depending where-- High spot,
low spot, where you are,

19:13.581 --> 19:15.214
it'll be colder than that.

19:15.282 --> 19:16.816
That's without the wind.

19:16.818 --> 19:19.552
You add wind to that, depends
how much wind, you can go to

19:19.554 --> 19:21.254
a hundred below pretty quickly.

19:23.924 --> 19:27.393
Just getting into the Richardson
Mountains, southbound.

19:27.395 --> 19:30.263
I think next we're gonna go
through The Gorge here shortly.

19:30.265 --> 19:32.932
If there is a wind,
it'll be blowing there.

19:32.934 --> 19:36.636
I have every intentions of driving
through it, one way or the other.

19:36.638 --> 19:40.840
Wind, snow, hell, or high water,
I'm going from here to Whitehorse.

19:40.842 --> 19:47.280
Narrator: But just as he
reaches Hurricane Alley...

19:47.282 --> 19:49.916
Be careful going
down the hill there.

19:49.918 --> 19:55.188
There's a truck off on the side
and equipment working down there.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.390
I copy you.

19:57.392 --> 20:02.595
Narrator: The 70-mile-an-hour winds
have already claimed one truck.

20:02.597 --> 20:03.663
Trouble ahead.

20:03.665 --> 20:08.000
There it is.

20:08.002 --> 20:11.337
He was coming through a blow
and got too close to the edge.

20:11.339 --> 20:15.742
It was over-plowed,
and over he went.

20:15.744 --> 20:20.179
That's a reminder that anything
can happen at any time.

20:20.181 --> 20:23.282
Narrator: The driver of this rig
made it out alive, but for

20:23.284 --> 20:27.353
Alex, it could be much worse.

20:27.355 --> 20:33.826
The trailer catches wind like a sail, making
the truck nearly impossible to control.

20:33.828 --> 20:40.366
If Alex doesn't keep a steady
hand, the results could be fatal.

20:46.774 --> 20:52.545
What's all these
sliding marks here?

20:52.547 --> 20:56.382
Have mercy on all of us, Lord.

20:58.852 --> 21:00.920
Whoa, boy.

21:00.922 --> 21:01.988
[Tanks clanking]

21:01.990 --> 21:05.558
Boy, is it ever
giving her here?

21:05.560 --> 21:09.061
Feel it pushing the
truck sideways.

21:11.732 --> 21:15.835
The steering wheel just turns
itself with that wind.

21:15.936 --> 21:18.738
Whoa!

21:18.740 --> 21:22.108
My dangerous goods are
shaking all over.

21:22.110 --> 21:23.443
Holy mackerel!

21:26.059 --> 21:29.795
Narrator: On Canada's Dempster
highway, in the middle

21:29.797 --> 21:35.334
- of Hurricane Alley...
- Whoa, boy.

21:35.435 --> 21:38.337
Boy, is it ever giving her here?

21:38.339 --> 21:40.672
Feel it pushing the
truck sideways.

21:40.674 --> 21:47.246
Narrator: Alex Debogorski is
fighting 70 mile-an-hour winds...

21:47.248 --> 21:49.481
The steering wheel just turns
itself with that wind.

21:49.549 --> 21:53.685
Narrator: To keep his load of
dangerous goods on the road.

21:56.089 --> 21:59.024
Whoa!

21:59.026 --> 22:03.495
My dangerous goods are
shaking all over.

22:03.497 --> 22:05.597
Whoa, baby, whoa.

22:05.599 --> 22:08.767
I've got the trailer crosswise
and everything here.

22:12.438 --> 22:15.307
Come on, you son of a gun.

22:18.811 --> 22:21.847
That was a big mess,
that's all I know.

22:21.948 --> 22:27.486
Narrator: - 15 miles south...
- Okay, here we-- here we go.

22:27.488 --> 22:31.223
Narrator: The winds die down...
[Horn honks]

22:31.225 --> 22:35.193
As Alex reaches the end
of Hurricane Alley.

22:35.195 --> 22:37.763
The worst thing that could
have happened is I could have

22:37.765 --> 22:40.932
blown this trailer
to smithereens.

22:40.934 --> 22:42.968
My wife would be looking
for a new husband.

22:43.069 --> 22:46.938
[Laughs]

22:53.579 --> 22:59.584
Narrator: - 2,000 miles to the southeast...
- That's ten years I've been doing this.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.220
That's the first time I've
lost anything off my load.

23:02.222 --> 23:08.393
Narrator: Rick Yemm has left the
convoy and some of his cargo behind.

23:08.395 --> 23:09.861
There's nothing I
can do about it.

23:09.863 --> 23:14.232
It's a fucking giant bag.

23:14.234 --> 23:17.402
Narrator: Ten miles back...

23:17.437 --> 23:22.507
They are pretty proud of our delivery
rate and the service we provide.

23:22.575 --> 23:29.748
If you cannot-- if you cannot provide the
service, we could lose the business.

23:29.750 --> 23:34.920
It looks like
somebody lost a bag.

23:34.922 --> 23:37.889
Narrator: Convoy partner Vlad
Pleskot rolls up on the

23:37.891 --> 23:40.859
abandoned cement bag.

23:40.861 --> 23:43.595
Better check it out.

23:45.998 --> 23:47.199
Damn it.

23:47.201 --> 23:51.103
For fucks sake, what'd
you do behind the wheel?

23:55.775 --> 23:57.142
Fuck.

23:57.144 --> 24:01.580
He was just flying like crazy,
and that's what happens.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.487
Good job, fucking Joe.

24:08.489 --> 24:11.757
Narrator: - And for the Polar Bear...
- It kind of throws a fucking door

24:11.759 --> 24:13.024
into our good timing here.

24:13.026 --> 24:18.196
Narrator: That's profit sitting
on the side of the road.

24:18.264 --> 24:20.632
Yeah, it's probably gonna
be a little bit of a bitch.

24:20.634 --> 24:22.567
Well, this can cost
me a lot of money.

24:22.569 --> 24:24.936
I mean-- I don't know what
we're gonna do with that.

24:24.938 --> 24:26.938
Fuck.

24:31.043 --> 24:34.379
Shit happens.

24:34.447 --> 24:37.282
It's not like we're driving
down the fucking Dalton.

24:37.284 --> 24:44.923
We'd probably never lose a load...
and if you do, you're just a dumbass.

24:44.925 --> 24:46.391
Well, it's even here too.

24:46.393 --> 24:50.729
I knew better.

24:50.731 --> 24:53.331
Narrator: And now it's up to
Hugh to find a way to clean

24:53.333 --> 24:55.133
Rick's mess up.

24:55.234 --> 24:58.036
What he'll have to do is just
back this trailer up to the

24:58.038 --> 25:01.807
bag and just hook on with the
chains, lift that bag back up

25:01.809 --> 25:05.310
onto the trailer and
just tie it down.

25:09.916 --> 25:11.917
Just back up a little bit.

25:15.154 --> 25:17.289
There you go.

25:17.291 --> 25:19.658
And we're only gonna get one
shot at it, and if it don't

25:19.660 --> 25:20.659
work, we're fucked.

25:20.661 --> 25:25.030
Narrator: Luckily, this
delivery includes a loader.

25:25.032 --> 25:30.902
It's their only shot at
lifting the 3,000-pound bag.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.471
Put it down first.

25:32.473 --> 25:34.372
Hook right on the edge.

25:40.947 --> 25:42.180
Okay, back it up.

25:42.182 --> 25:45.917
[Beeping]

25:48.988 --> 25:51.289
Easy, easy.

25:51.291 --> 25:54.559
Okay.

25:54.561 --> 25:57.896
Good.

25:57.898 --> 26:00.465
You'll have to thank
fucking Joe for that one.

26:00.467 --> 26:02.367
Go ahead.

26:02.369 --> 26:04.302
You can probably get
one more in there.

26:04.304 --> 26:05.270
A little bit.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.172
There you go.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.107
I just don't like his
attitude, you know?

26:09.109 --> 26:10.342
I mean, you're the driver.

26:10.344 --> 26:14.546
You're paid for pick-- picking
up the load, you're paid for

26:14.548 --> 26:17.249
bringing the load to the
customer, you're paid for

26:17.251 --> 26:18.817
delivering the load.

26:18.819 --> 26:22.654
If you can't do it, what the
heck are you doing up here?

26:22.755 --> 26:23.822
I'll buy you a beer.

26:23.824 --> 26:25.290
How does that sound?

26:25.292 --> 26:30.462
That's about all the
sympathy I got for you.

26:30.530 --> 26:32.831
It's really hard to care at
this point in the season too.

26:32.833 --> 26:34.165
[Laughs]

26:36.602 --> 26:44.242
Narrator: - 2,100 miles to the northwest...
- You gotta want this.

26:44.244 --> 26:46.545
You really gotta want
this kind of a job.

26:46.547 --> 26:53.151
Narrator: Ray Veilleux is 100 miles up the
Dalton with his first load of the season.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.186
You gotta want
living on the edge.

26:55.188 --> 26:56.988
You're always living on
the edge, doing this.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.290
It just gets in your blood.

26:58.357 --> 27:01.293
I worked hard two years ago,
showed 'em I could do it.

27:01.295 --> 27:03.562
You know, they trusted
me with the loads.

27:03.564 --> 27:04.529
I got it done.

27:04.597 --> 27:07.632
So I'd have to say,
hard work does pay off.

27:07.634 --> 27:09.634
I'm back.

27:18.010 --> 27:22.547
Aw, shit.

27:22.549 --> 27:24.282
I'm out of power.

27:24.284 --> 27:25.884
Shit.

27:25.886 --> 27:28.553
I'll try to limp it up to
the top of the hill here.

27:35.328 --> 27:37.262
Now we're screwed.

27:46.973 --> 27:48.106
We blew something.

27:48.108 --> 27:53.011
I just gotta find
out what we blew.

27:53.013 --> 27:54.245
There it is.

27:59.385 --> 28:01.720
Yeah, I blew something
in the turbo.

28:01.722 --> 28:05.156
Now we're pumping the oil through
the turbo into the exhaust.

28:05.158 --> 28:09.828
Then it gets all hot, and you blow
out a big old exhaust smoke cloud.

28:09.830 --> 28:10.729
So we're done.

28:10.731 --> 28:11.796
We're finished.

28:11.798 --> 28:17.335
Narrator: A busted turbo means
Ray's truck isn't going anywhere.

28:17.337 --> 28:22.340
The whole situation
really sucks.

28:22.342 --> 28:28.980
Narrator: But even worse, it
means he's stranded at 28 below.

28:28.982 --> 28:32.550
I'm down and out on the side
of the road, broke down, so

28:32.552 --> 28:33.885
we'll just sit here and wait.

28:44.764 --> 28:50.068
Narrator: - 100 miles to the north...
- This load is-- it's a reefer trailer.

28:50.070 --> 28:52.904
It's just another load
to the load count.

28:52.906 --> 28:54.472
All for the load count.

28:54.474 --> 29:01.046
Narrator: Darrell Ward's leading the
pack, already halfway up the road.

29:01.048 --> 29:03.715
Makes me happy that they give
me these hot loads, you know?

29:03.717 --> 29:05.817
I know if they're giving me the
hot loads, they know I'm gonna

29:05.819 --> 29:07.986
get 'em delivered there on time.

29:07.988 --> 29:10.155
Get 'er done.

29:10.157 --> 29:13.158
Narrator: The rocky Mountain
log hauler is pushing past

29:13.160 --> 29:17.262
Coldfoot to get back on
top of the leaderboard.

29:17.264 --> 29:19.164
I've been doing this
for a long time.

29:19.231 --> 29:22.901
You know, sometimes a guy burns
out and just gets, you know, mad.

29:22.903 --> 29:26.237
I've had enough of it for a while,
and it takes a change to

29:26.239 --> 29:28.907
get you out of that
rut, you know?

29:28.974 --> 29:32.143
I mean, I was in a rut for quite
a few years there, with the

29:32.145 --> 29:35.113
marriage and the logging, the
timber industry, the housing

29:35.115 --> 29:37.882
market, you know, everything
going to shit on me.

29:37.884 --> 29:40.251
And got Reno, you know,
graduating from high school,

29:40.253 --> 29:41.419
about to fly the coop.

29:41.421 --> 29:44.556
Come up here, and kind of got
myself out of that rut,

29:44.558 --> 29:46.424
feeling pretty good about what
I'm doing again and looking

29:46.426 --> 29:49.227
forward to a new-- new
lifestyle and change.

29:49.229 --> 29:51.329
I'm enjoying what I'm doing.

29:51.331 --> 29:54.165
I'm thinking about staying
here with Carlile.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.769
You know, we'll go from there,
see where my life goes.

30:00.473 --> 30:03.875
Narrator: As night falls...

30:06.979 --> 30:09.047
80 miles behind Darrell...

30:09.081 --> 30:11.082
Been busting hump, man.

30:11.084 --> 30:16.788
Busting it hard, working these long
hours, day after day after day.

30:16.856 --> 30:21.960
Narrator: Jack Jessee's load of pipe
is just as brutal as he expected.

30:21.962 --> 30:24.262
I really don't
like hauling pipe.

30:24.264 --> 30:27.065
Basically, it usually
rides like crap up here.

30:27.067 --> 30:31.636
Trailers are designed to bend
and bow in the middle, and

30:31.638 --> 30:34.305
that's part of your
suspension that's added on.

30:34.307 --> 30:38.743
When you load pipe up, it's like
throwing a huge brick onto it,

30:38.745 --> 30:41.146
and it makes that trailer rigid.

30:41.148 --> 30:44.449
Now your only suspension is the
truck bouncing up and down, so

30:44.451 --> 30:47.418
everything's always
bouncing up and down.

30:47.420 --> 30:49.854
It's just rough.

30:49.856 --> 30:55.593
It constantly beats on you, it
beats on you, and beats on you.

30:55.595 --> 31:01.466
You're just getting thrown
around, bounced around, slung

31:01.468 --> 31:04.335
forward and backwards,
left and right.

31:04.337 --> 31:08.406
You know, then you-- you tend
to get more fatigued faster.

31:08.408 --> 31:11.910
Narrator: Feeling the effects
of the rugged ride, Jack

31:11.912 --> 31:16.047
approaches one of the trickiest
turns on the Dalton that's

31:16.049 --> 31:20.051
marked the end of the road
for dozens of drivers.

31:26.592 --> 31:30.128
The load is just beating me up.

31:40.472 --> 31:42.674
Ooh.

31:42.676 --> 31:44.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:45.553 --> 31:49.055
Narrator: 200 miles
north of Fairbanks...

31:52.326 --> 31:56.830
Jack Jessee is eight hours into
a rough ride as he hits a turn

31:56.832 --> 31:58.998
with a name that says it all.

32:05.206 --> 32:07.073
Ooh.

32:13.481 --> 32:15.448
Whoa.

32:19.386 --> 32:23.556
That alley is just way too
close for my comfort level.

32:23.558 --> 32:27.093
Time to pull over and
take a nap somewhere.

32:31.232 --> 32:32.532
I'm just too worn out.

32:32.534 --> 32:35.702
This pipe's just beating
me up too much.

32:35.704 --> 32:40.273
I'm gonna shut it down here, get
a good night's rest, and deal

32:40.275 --> 32:42.275
with it in the morning.

32:42.277 --> 32:44.744
It's been a long season.

32:44.746 --> 32:48.148
Narrator: Despite starting
the day with the load count

32:48.150 --> 32:52.752
lead, the ace makes the call
to shut down in Coldfoot

32:52.754 --> 32:56.623
before the exhausting
trip takes him out.

32:56.625 --> 32:58.658
Time for bed.

32:58.660 --> 32:59.659
I'm beat.

32:59.661 --> 33:02.295
I'm not even going inside.

33:02.297 --> 33:04.731
Just going to bed.

33:08.536 --> 33:12.472
Narrator: - While Jack calls it a night...
- The lights of Prudhoe Bay...

33:12.474 --> 33:13.640
Again!

33:13.642 --> 33:16.476
Another load for
the load count.

33:16.478 --> 33:19.012
Narrator: Darrell's
finishing his haul.

33:19.014 --> 33:21.080
We got her here on time.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.082
Arctic express.

33:23.084 --> 33:28.288
Narrator: And the delivery has him
back on top of the load count.

33:28.290 --> 33:31.191
Right on, mission accomplished!

33:31.193 --> 33:33.827
Ice roads are coming to
an end here pretty quick.

33:33.829 --> 33:37.263
So I'd just as soon get back out
there and get a few more loads in.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.264
Get as much as I can.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.633
I don't have that
much time left.

33:40.635 --> 33:42.735
It's all part of the job!

33:42.737 --> 33:45.271
It's what you gotta do when
it's this cold, you know?

33:45.273 --> 33:47.740
Let's go get some more loads.

33:47.742 --> 33:49.075
Make the load count.

33:49.077 --> 33:50.810
All right, I'm outta here.

33:52.847 --> 33:56.182
Narrator: 2,000 miles to the southeast...

33:56.217 --> 34:00.620
We're about 3 1/2 hours
late gettin' here today.

34:00.688 --> 34:02.889
Definitely was not record time.

34:02.891 --> 34:06.459
It's fucking 7:45.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.262
We got fucked up
again on this trip.

34:09.264 --> 34:12.565
Narrator: Hugh and Vlad have
made it to Pauingassi...

34:12.567 --> 34:15.268
Last bag, ready to go.

34:15.270 --> 34:19.973
Narrator: But Rick's way
ahead and already unloaded.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.175
And I'm rolling.

34:26.647 --> 34:27.914
Whoo-hoo!

34:32.152 --> 34:32.886
Where'd he go?

34:32.888 --> 34:34.687
He's pulling out.

34:40.094 --> 34:42.996
Narrator: Thanks to Hugh and
Vlad, every cement bag has made

34:42.998 --> 34:45.531
it to the delivery site.

34:45.533 --> 34:48.101
I guess, you know, even if we
had some problems on the road,

34:48.103 --> 34:51.638
we still got it delivered, and
that's what counts, right?

34:51.639 --> 34:53.873
Well, I think I'm ready.

35:01.949 --> 35:07.453
So Rick's just got
out of dodge there.

35:07.455 --> 35:10.790
Now he's stepping on her
a little bit, yeah.

35:10.792 --> 35:15.228
But Rick, he don't want to do
anything anymore, he just--

35:15.230 --> 35:17.363
He doesn't want to do this,
he doesn't want to do that.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.066
Fuck it.

35:20.068 --> 35:20.900
He doesn't want to do it.

35:20.902 --> 35:21.634
Fuck him.

35:21.636 --> 35:27.607
So... can't blame
anybody but himself.

35:27.609 --> 35:29.442
'Cause he wants to drive like I
do, but he doesn't want to spend

35:29.444 --> 35:31.611
the time hookin' her up.

35:31.613 --> 35:35.782
That's why he loses his loads.

35:35.784 --> 35:38.851
Back for fucking
Winnipeg one more time.

35:38.853 --> 35:45.591
Narrator: - 2,100 miles to the northwest...
- We're marching to the top.

35:45.593 --> 35:47.660
Slowly but surely.

35:47.662 --> 35:52.865
Narrator: Austin Wheeler's reached
Atigun Pass with his oversized loader.

35:52.867 --> 35:55.435
Yeah, usually for a lot of people
this is kind of a trouble

35:55.437 --> 35:58.705
spot for them to get up and over,
but the pass hasn't really

35:58.707 --> 36:03.476
been an issue for
me this season.

36:03.577 --> 36:06.045
Hey, Austin, you on this one?

36:06.047 --> 36:07.146
Yeah, go ahead.

36:07.148 --> 36:08.047
Bad spot, man.

36:08.049 --> 36:09.749
I burned out coming up there.

36:09.751 --> 36:13.686
Narrator: As Austin hits the
incline, another Carlile driver

36:13.688 --> 36:16.656
is already in trouble.

36:16.658 --> 36:21.928
Went to downshift, and it
locked in between gears.

36:22.029 --> 36:24.764
Narrator: Hooked to a heavy
trailer, the other truck stalled

36:24.766 --> 36:27.400
out in the middle of the road.

36:27.402 --> 36:33.139
You back down the hill as far as you
need to, and, uh, I'll push you up there.

36:33.141 --> 36:37.310
All right.

36:37.312 --> 36:41.414
One of our Carlile guys is stuck
on Atigun Pass and is just

36:41.416 --> 36:42.849
having a rough time.

36:42.851 --> 36:45.952
So I'm gonna throw a set of
chains on and help him out.

36:57.731 --> 37:01.134
Okay, Bart, I got chains on,
so I'm ready whenever you are.

37:01.136 --> 37:04.404
All right.

37:04.406 --> 37:07.907
Narrator: Pushing a truck up
Atigun Pass is a tricky maneuver.

37:07.909 --> 37:11.044
Austin's gotta sync his speed
with the other driver and

37:11.046 --> 37:15.581
connect without slamming
into the truck.

37:15.583 --> 37:19.485
Okay, I'm rolling, so you start
rolling and I'll catch you.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.220
Yes, sir.

37:21.222 --> 37:24.390
All right, here I come.

37:24.392 --> 37:26.859
Narrator: A little off, and
they'll both end up at the

37:26.861 --> 37:30.029
bottom of the mountain.

37:32.032 --> 37:33.633
All right, I'm almost to you.

37:33.635 --> 37:34.634
I'm almost there.

37:34.636 --> 37:36.002
Almost there.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.403
Almost there.

37:43.243 --> 37:44.544
Aw, damn it!

37:45.978 --> 37:51.516
Narrator: - On Atigun Pass...
- Okay, I'm rolling, so you

37:51.518 --> 37:55.320
start rolling and
I'll catch you.

37:55.322 --> 37:57.956
All right, here I come.

37:59.925 --> 38:03.828
Narrator: Austin Wheeler is
attempting a veteran move...

38:03.830 --> 38:05.129
All right, I'm almost to you.

38:05.131 --> 38:06.130
Almost there.

38:06.132 --> 38:07.465
Almost there.

38:07.467 --> 38:11.669
Narrator: Helping a fellow driver
get to the top of the mountain.

38:16.108 --> 38:18.509
Aw, damn it!

38:18.511 --> 38:20.111
Uh-oh.

38:26.685 --> 38:31.089
I felt that.

38:31.091 --> 38:32.924
You wanna try that again?

38:33.025 --> 38:34.926
Nah, just hold this speed, Bart.

38:34.928 --> 38:38.630
We don't wanna fuck
anything up here.

38:38.632 --> 38:41.232
Narrator: Now that Austin's
connected to the other truck,

38:41.234 --> 38:45.536
he's at the mercy of
the other driver.

38:45.538 --> 38:48.473
Bart, try to stay away
from that guardrail, bro.

38:48.475 --> 38:52.610
All right.

38:52.612 --> 38:54.712
Whenever you're push-trucking,
the front truck

38:54.714 --> 38:57.048
that you're pushing is the
steer truck, so if he gets

38:57.050 --> 39:00.285
too close to the guardrail,
it's the caterpillar effect.

39:00.287 --> 39:03.254
I follow right next to him, my
trailer falls in the guardrail.

39:07.426 --> 39:10.628
My trailer's gonna hit the guardrail
if you don't stay out of it.

39:10.630 --> 39:13.765
Narrator: One wrong move here
could send them both into the

39:13.767 --> 39:16.467
rail and over the
edge of the pass.

39:26.011 --> 39:29.647
Keep on goin'.

39:32.017 --> 39:33.818
Couple hundred more yards.

39:37.389 --> 39:40.458
We are chewing up the fucking road.

39:50.135 --> 39:53.004
All right.

39:53.006 --> 39:56.541
Narrator: Finally,
they reach the top.

39:56.543 --> 39:59.077
Appreciate it, Austin.

39:59.079 --> 40:02.547
Even if it wasn't a Carlile truck,
I'd still stop and help this guy.

40:02.549 --> 40:05.016
'Cause if I needed help in the
middle of the hill, I'd hope

40:05.018 --> 40:06.985
somebody would stop
to help me too.

40:06.987 --> 40:07.819
We got to the top.

40:07.821 --> 40:12.824
I'm gonna hop out, take my chains
off, and make sure Bart's okay.

40:12.925 --> 40:13.758
I appreciate your help.

40:13.760 --> 40:16.227
No problem, anything
to help anybody out.

40:16.229 --> 40:17.628
Have a safe trip up there.

40:17.630 --> 40:18.997
Yeah, I will.

40:19.064 --> 40:23.101
There's a camaraderie
among truckers up here.

40:23.103 --> 40:25.903
I hope someday I'll be able to
return the favor to Austin.

40:25.905 --> 40:28.606
You know, maybe next time
it'll be me helping him.

40:28.608 --> 40:30.308
[Laughs]

40:30.310 --> 40:31.476
Northbound, ten wide, comin'

40:31.478 --> 40:33.044
down the pass.

40:33.046 --> 40:36.581
We'll get back on our way to
Prudhoe now and, uh, there we

40:36.583 --> 40:38.850
go, down the pass.

40:38.852 --> 40:41.452
Narrator: After a season
struggling to prove he belongs

40:41.454 --> 40:44.422
- on the Dalton...
- It worked out good.

40:44.424 --> 40:47.058
I was definitely glad I
could help somebody out.

40:47.060 --> 40:51.329
Narrator: Austin's finally earning
the respect of other drivers.

40:51.331 --> 40:53.931
I've rescued trucks, I've
pulled trucks out of the ditch.

40:53.933 --> 40:56.934
I've-- I've pulled heavy
loads up the road.

40:56.936 --> 40:59.303
I've done a lot of things to
gain the respect of, you know,

40:59.305 --> 41:02.006
other drivers and
people at Carlile.

41:02.008 --> 41:05.743
It feels good to finish the
season strong, for sure.

41:05.745 --> 41:08.379
Gonna unhitch this load.

41:08.381 --> 41:11.049
Let's get the fuck outta here.

41:15.220 --> 41:19.490
Narrator: - Over in the Yukon...
- Comin' up on Whitehorse.

41:19.492 --> 41:21.392
It's been a long day.

41:21.394 --> 41:25.029
Narrator: Alex is also at the end
of his trip, delivering the

41:25.031 --> 41:28.599
dangerous load of
combustible gases.

41:28.601 --> 41:31.869
You know, we had a rough ride
in two spots on the Dempster.

41:31.871 --> 41:36.774
Probably chipped a little
paint off the tanks.

41:36.776 --> 41:42.680
But things turned out good
and we made it through.

41:42.682 --> 41:45.583
Okay, I'm gonna head
downtown and get a room.

41:45.585 --> 41:49.654
And a good time
will be had by all.

41:49.688 --> 41:52.757
Narrator: Alex pulls into
a tie for second place.

41:52.759 --> 41:59.497
And Austin and Darrell
share the top spot...

41:59.531 --> 42:02.767
While Ray Veilleux
is left stranded.

42:02.769 --> 42:05.103
[Groans]

42:05.105 --> 42:12.110
Narrator: - He's stuck in a broken-down
truck at 31 below... - Sucks.

42:12.112 --> 42:15.379
Narrator: With temperatures
dropping in the dead of the night.

42:15.381 --> 42:17.582
[Wind blowing]

42:26.358 --> 42:29.660
[Truck horn honks]

42:29.662 --> 42:30.895
Ray's broke down here.

42:30.897 --> 42:33.764
I imagine he's
pretty cold by now.

42:33.766 --> 42:37.668
Narrator: Carlile trainer Phil
Kromm is the first to arrive.

42:37.670 --> 42:38.936
[Air brakes hiss]

42:38.938 --> 42:39.770
Hi, Ray.

42:39.772 --> 42:40.538
Hey!

42:40.540 --> 42:41.405
[Both laughing]

42:41.407 --> 42:42.106
Are you cold yet?

42:42.108 --> 42:43.007
Oh, I'm cold.

42:43.009 --> 42:44.008
Yeah, yeah.

42:44.010 --> 42:45.042
It's cold in there.

42:45.044 --> 42:45.943
So I'm done.

42:45.945 --> 42:46.911
Yeah, yeah, it's done.

42:46.913 --> 42:50.381
So much for loads.

42:50.383 --> 42:56.387
Narrator: Ray's out of the cold,
but his first trip was a bust.

42:59.691 --> 43:05.196
And now he's gotta prove he still
has what it takes to drive the Dalton.

43:05.198 --> 43:11.324
Well, it sucks that the truck breaks down,
but that's the way it is. Shit happens.

43:11.325 --> 43:13.788
Definitely...

43:18.788 --> 43:20.394
Narrator: Next time on
Ice Road Truckers...

43:20.429 --> 43:24.195
I don't really feel like
swimming in this water.

43:24.230 --> 43:26.553
The season hits the
home stretch...

43:26.588 --> 43:28.699
This is when the ice roads
are most dangerous.

43:29.488 --> 43:31.220
Something's wrong
with my truck.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.119
But a final push...

43:33.503 --> 43:35.442
Get me as many loads
as you can...

43:35.875 --> 43:37.326
Goes too far...

43:37.521 --> 43:39.259
That guy is gonna
be going out soon.

43:39.294 --> 43:41.759
If I screwed up,
it could be bad news.

43:42.432 --> 43:43.474
On the Dempster...

43:43.574 --> 43:45.470
Hold it. Hold it.
Whoo.

43:46.017 --> 43:48.192
Hurricane Alley's
not done yet...

43:48.322 --> 43:49.520
Come on...

43:49.844 --> 43:53.011
And it's the end of
the line for Hugh and Rick.

43:53.243 --> 43:55.099
I can tell the ice
is very, very soft.

43:56.075 --> 43:57.592
I didn't even *
