00:03.960 --> 00:06.400
<i>Coming to Palace,</i>
<i>it was my changing life moment.</i>

00:06.480 --> 00:09.200
<i>I was finished and I didn't wanna</i>
<i>play football in England anymore.</i>

00:09.280 --> 00:11.360
<i>I got a phone call from Dougie.</i>

00:11.440 --> 00:12.400
Who have we signed now?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.040
<i>He's my best friend in football.</i>

00:14.120 --> 00:15.600
You can see the team spirit.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.280
And if you sign today, you play
tomorrow against Sheffield Wednesday.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.800
<i>He's got the right ingredients here...</i>

00:19.920 --> 00:21.280
<i>Definitely made an instant impact.</i>

00:21.360 --> 00:24.080
It was like we won Champions League.
Yes, we won a game in football.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.760
<i>Dikgacoi!</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:29.240
<i>The Palace recovery continues.</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:31.560
Once we started winning games,
we just couldn't get off that winning run.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.440
<i>Simply magical for Wilfried Zaha!</i>

00:34.520 --> 00:36.680
Everyone dug in so deep for each other.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.440
<i>Murray from the penalty spot.</i>

00:39.600 --> 00:40.800
It was a great atmosphere.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.080
Togetherness, the best I've seen.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.040
<i>Simply sensational for the young star.</i>

00:47.120 --> 00:49.120
And the passion also to do well
for the club.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.000
<i>19 points from their last</i>
<i>7 games for Crystal Palace.</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:53.920
There's gonna be
so many twists and turns.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.680
<i>35 yards and goes for a goal.</i>

00:55.760 --> 00:57.840
You could feel we had
one of those moments.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.760
<i>Oh, he's done it!</i>

01:02.280 --> 01:04.520
Hopefully something great can be achieved.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.000
We've had a phone call from Bolton
to speak to the manager.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.720
Bolton had made it clear.
They would like me to be their manager.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.240
We were building something
that was so exciting.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.800
<i>Crystal Palace have parted company</i>
<i>with Dougie Freedman.</i>

01:16.880 --> 01:18.440
-The manager's gone.
-He left us.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.520
I couldn't believe it.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.080
It was a sad moment. He was in tears.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.360
So why would you go?

01:22.440 --> 01:25.320
-Genuinely hurt.
-You don't want this great run to end.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.480
We're still winning games here.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.360
Here we go again.
What's gonna happen now?

01:33.560 --> 01:36.000
<i>They are back from the brink.</i>

01:37.200 --> 01:38.840
<i>The club that they've loved</i>
<i>since children.</i>

01:39.680 --> 01:41.160
<i>Wilfried Zaha!</i>

01:42.880 --> 01:45.520
<i>That is magical. Simply magical.</i>

01:45.600 --> 01:47.320
<i>Top of the championship.</i>

01:47.400 --> 01:49.640
<i>Cannot believe what</i>
<i>Crystal Palace have done.</i>

01:49.720 --> 01:51.720
<i>Back from the brink of oblivion.</i>

01:51.800 --> 01:54.200
<i>In the biggest match,</i>
<i>on the biggest stage.</i>

01:54.280 --> 01:57.920
<i>That will always be etched</i>
<i>in Crystal Palace history.</i>

02:09.360 --> 02:10.840
<i>All change for Crystal Palace.</i>

02:10.960 --> 02:14.640
<i>Dougie Freedman's departure</i>
<i>to Bolton Wanderers means that</i>

02:14.760 --> 02:17.600
<i>Curtis Fleming and Lennie Lawrence</i>
<i>are in charge for this one.</i>

02:19.600 --> 02:22.440
<i>We knew that we had a part to play</i>
<i>in order to get us through this period</i>

02:22.520 --> 02:25.800
<i>and it was nothing that,</i>
<i>us at the time, we couldn't all handle.</i>

02:25.880 --> 02:27.600
We just got on with it.
We had an understanding.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.520
Without really saying too much
to each other, we had an understanding.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.080
It didn't really affect us that much,
because we thought, "Okay, you've gone,

02:34.160 --> 02:37.920
...but we know where we're going
and we know what we wanna do."

02:38.000 --> 02:40.600
<i>Here's Parr. Murray scores.</i>

02:40.680 --> 02:42.280
<i>We all had each other's back,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

02:42.400 --> 02:45.320
<i>And I gotta commend everyone</i>
<i>for the way that they responded.</i>

02:45.400 --> 02:48.880
<i>I think Dougie probably underestimated</i>
<i>our ability to get as far as what we did.</i>

02:49.000 --> 02:51.320
I never asked Dougie,
but I'd say the reason he left

02:51.440 --> 02:53.920
is he probably thought that
the squad were maybe a bit thin.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.480
And over the course of 46, 50 game season,
it might run out of steam.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.840
It would have been easy to just allow
the emotional part to get to you,

03:00.920 --> 03:03.120
but I'm not saying that
that didn't affect anyone.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.320
You know, I think it sort of took
into that weekend even though

03:06.400 --> 03:09.960
Lennie was taking the team,
he would be leaving and joining Dougie.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.280
Dougie had spoken to me and said,
"Look, I wanna take you up to Bolton."

03:13.360 --> 03:15.120
I was very keen to go up there.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.800
Steve actually
called me personally and said,

03:16.880 --> 03:19.680
"Look, Dougie's phoned me,
but I wanna keep you here.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.520
We like what you do
and we don't wanna lose all the staff.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.600
We need some stability here.
We need some staff

03:24.680 --> 03:26.880
that have been here
and know the players well."

03:26.960 --> 03:28.440
That meant a lot to me.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.600
That meant a lot and I stayed.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.400
Somebody said to me,
"You should talk to the players."

03:32.480 --> 03:34.200
I remember going to the hotel
and speaking to the players.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.320
I just said to them, "Look,
I can only promise you one thing

03:36.400 --> 03:39.800
this isn't a lack of seriousness
from me about trying to get promotion.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.400
<i>I want promotion more than anything.</i>

03:41.480 --> 03:45.040
I will be finding you a manager
that will help us do that.

03:45.120 --> 03:49.520
It's not a lack of ambition
from my part that has led to this."

03:49.600 --> 03:52.680
<i>I think they were in such a groove</i>
<i>at the time as a squad</i>

03:52.760 --> 03:54.520
<i>that they were just on an upward curve.</i>

03:54.600 --> 03:57.000
The focus was phenomenal in that side.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.600
He left and it was like, "Okay, fine,
it's just another road bump for us.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.200
But we know we are
onto a good thing here,

04:02.280 --> 04:05.320
so let's just stay focused
and just keep winning games,"

04:05.400 --> 04:07.920
and that's pretty much what happened.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.640
<i>Here's Garvan, to deliver</i>
<i>from the right-hand side,</i>

04:16.760 --> 04:18.600
<i>deeper across this time.</i>
<i>Out comes Schmeichel.</i>

04:18.720 --> 04:21.280
<i>He's dropped it.</i>
<i>Real chance, it's hammered in!</i>

04:21.360 --> 04:25.240
<i>And Damien Delaney has</i>
<i>his third goal in four games.</i>

04:25.320 --> 04:28.440
<i>He's turning into a goal machine,</i>
<i>Damien Delaney.</i>

04:30.880 --> 04:34.320
<i>This is incredible.</i>
<i>The two centre-halves combine.</i>

04:34.400 --> 04:38.120
<i>And they're in dreamland,</i>
<i>the 2700 Eagles fans.</i>

04:38.200 --> 04:40.000
<i>We've got a really good bunch of players,</i>

04:40.080 --> 04:43.040
<i>and they're strong, and they've got</i>
<i>a great captain in Jedinak.</i>

04:43.120 --> 04:46.280
And it was a fantastic performance.
And we did it without a manager.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.280
And I think that was so important
'cause that installed the belief

04:48.360 --> 04:49.400
that we could go without him.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.280
I think Leicester was the best performance
of the season up to then.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.560
It was incredible performance.
They tried to sing our song at one point.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.200
<i>And we even sang that back to them</i>
<i>and showed them how to do that properly.</i>

04:58.280 --> 05:00.720
<i>It was a fantastic day,</i>
<i>especially with the backdrop</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:04.320
<i>of losing a superb manager</i>
<i>who'd been responsible</i>

05:04.440 --> 05:07.440
for so much of building
the squad that we had.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.360
We looked at a few people.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.880
<i>Sean Dyche, I was particularly keen on.</i>

05:11.960 --> 05:15.680
We spoke to him, and I think
on the very day that we spoke to him,

05:15.760 --> 05:17.040
<i>he got the Burnley job.</i>

05:17.120 --> 05:19.400
<i>I always thought that</i>
<i>what you achieve as a manager</i>

05:19.480 --> 05:21.680
<i>should be judged</i>
<i>against resources that you have.</i>

05:21.760 --> 05:25.640
<i>We were all very impressed by what</i>
<i>Ian Holloway had done at Blackpool.</i>

05:25.720 --> 05:29.480
<i>I just looked from afar at the things</i>
<i>that Ian had achieved at Blackpool</i>

05:29.560 --> 05:31.280
<i>and just thought they were astonishing.</i>

05:31.360 --> 05:32.520
<i>He'd got them promoted.</i>

05:32.600 --> 05:35.240
<i>They were a pretty small club</i>
<i>with a very low budget.</i>

05:35.320 --> 05:37.760
And, of course, loved the way
that he played football.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.720
In the Premier League, they were
pretty unlucky to be relegated.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.120
He kept the team spirit there.
He's obviously a fantastic personality.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.360
I contacted him straight away.
I had a conversation with him.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.080
I mean, he's such a fantastic character.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.320
It's impossible to not have
a meeting or a conversation with Ian

05:53.400 --> 05:55.600
and not come away invigorated and excited.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.920
We thought that he'd be a great addition.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.040
And he's very charismatic
and we were very impressed by him.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.440
We offered him the job,
but he then turned us down

06:05.520 --> 06:06.840
and took a job with Ipswich.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.360
And I remember thinking it's not over.
I don't know why.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.240
<i>It was Mick McCarthy or him</i>
<i>who were going for the Ipswich job.</i>

06:14.320 --> 06:17.320
<i>And then the next thing, they announced</i>
<i>another manager, Mick McCarthy.</i>

06:18.240 --> 06:19.480
I was thinking about other people

06:19.560 --> 06:21.720
and then I got a phone call
8 o'clock in the morning.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.640
And it was Ian on the phone

06:23.720 --> 06:26.920
with his broad, Bristolian accent.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.680
And he said,
"Now I don't want you to think

06:28.760 --> 06:31.560
that you're the last girl
on the dance floor or anything like that."

06:31.640 --> 06:36.160
He said, "I always wanted to come to you,
but he was offering me so much money.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.920
I couldn't turn him down."

06:38.000 --> 06:42.480
Ian's the funniest person
I've ever met in my life, genuinely.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.440
<i>I remember speaking to Stephen.</i>

06:44.520 --> 06:46.560
<i>It was a fantastic contract</i>
<i>they were offering at Ipswich.</i>

06:46.640 --> 06:49.680
<i>You know, much bigger than the one</i>
<i>that we offered him.</i>

06:49.920 --> 06:51.640
And then Ian made this statement.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.880
He said to me, "I'll tell you what.
I'll come to you,

06:54.960 --> 06:56.880
and if I don't work out, you can sack me,

06:56.960 --> 06:59.000
you don't have to pay me
any compensation."

06:59.320 --> 07:01.600
<i>And I said to him, "Okay, that's great.</i>

07:01.680 --> 07:03.720
<i>You know, you're really showing</i>
<i>that you do wanna come to us.</i>

07:03.800 --> 07:05.960
But look, I've learned enough
about football to know that,

07:06.040 --> 07:08.960
you know, you need a barrier
to sacking the manager. You do."

07:09.040 --> 07:11.280
So we agreed to everything
and Ian came to us.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.760
I remember he came down and he stayed
at Stephen's house the first night.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.640
<i>He drove down from Blackpool</i>
<i>with his wife, Kim,</i>

07:17.720 --> 07:19.440
<i>and stayed the night here.</i>

07:23.720 --> 07:26.200
<i>And I don't think we tied anything</i>
<i>up till the next morning</i>

07:26.280 --> 07:30.240
<i>and he literally just signed to become</i>
<i>the manager at the Blackburn Rovers game</i>

07:30.320 --> 07:32.160
<i>and sat in the stand.</i>

07:34.000 --> 07:38.280
<i>And then we embarked on almost</i>
<i>completely different experience to Dougie</i>

07:38.360 --> 07:41.680
<i>but a fantastic one, and one that</i>
<i>had lots of twists and turns.</i>

07:41.760 --> 07:44.240
Here we go. Circus is in town.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.360
Very, very different to Dougie.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.400
Ian Holloway bounds in the door.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.600
It'd be the best way
you could describe that.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.280
<i>When Palace rang, I actually</i>
<i>had a big decision to make.</i>

08:07.360 --> 08:09.600
"Do I wanna speak to them?" I did.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.680
They just blew me away, to be honest.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.560
When you think about Crystal Palace
and your time there now,

08:17.640 --> 08:19.200
how do you feel about Palace?

08:19.280 --> 08:22.520
<i>Immense pride really.</i>
<i>I didn't realize how big the club was.</i>

08:22.600 --> 08:25.960
I didn't realize that a lot
of the supporters turned their back

08:26.040 --> 08:29.640
on the game and jump up and down
in the far corner singing their heads off.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.520
<i>It's very unique, I must admit.</i>
<i>Very unique situation.</i>

08:34.120 --> 08:37.960
My first problem was finding the ground.
That was the biggest problem.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.680
I didn't trust my sat nav.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.280
I turned a right, I turned left
and I thought this can't be it.

08:42.360 --> 08:46.360
And then before you know it, you're right
in amongst all the bunch of houses but...

08:46.440 --> 08:49.200
My first game I watched
was the Blackburn Rovers game.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.760
<i>We won 2-0.</i>
<i>Didn't believe what I was being told.</i>

08:54.240 --> 08:56.040
<i>At Steve Browett’s house by.</i>

08:56.120 --> 08:59.000
<i>His family is saying, "Oh, Wilf,</i>
<i>he's just brilliant, you know.</i>

08:59.320 --> 09:01.200
<i>He's just too good for the division."</i>

09:01.280 --> 09:05.040
My sons are pretty passionate Palace fans
and, of course, they love Wilf.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.520
So I'm sure they did
a good job on him there.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.840
'Cause I had some wingers
who I thought were really good.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.320
Tom Ince and Matt Phillips.
He can't be that good.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.280
<i>So I watched that game</i>
<i>and he did things in that game</i>

09:15.360 --> 09:17.120
<i>that I didn't think were possible.</i>

09:17.560 --> 09:19.480
You know, he actually dinked
it up over someone

09:19.560 --> 09:21.600
and the crowd were singing his name and...

09:21.680 --> 09:24.480
I quickly got used to Wilf and his skill.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.960
<i>But it was very different</i>
<i>to what I was used to doing.</i>

09:28.040 --> 09:31.560
<i>Mine was possession based,</i>
<i>mine was working it from one side</i>

09:31.640 --> 09:33.560
<i>to the other, to hit a switch.</i>

09:33.640 --> 09:37.880
But it was with three attackers
and a midfield three.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.760
<i>But our midfield three</i>
<i>was very different.</i>

09:40.840 --> 09:43.080
<i>Two that would not cross</i>
<i>the halfway line,</i>

09:43.160 --> 09:45.000
<i>one who could go and join in.</i>

09:45.120 --> 09:47.880
<i>Owen Garvan was the defensive number 10,</i>

09:47.960 --> 09:50.200
<i>really, who could pass it as well.</i>

09:50.320 --> 09:53.680
<i>And then you had Andre Moritz</i>
<i>who you'd use as a sub and come on</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:56.000
<i>and he would give you</i>
<i>the attacking option</i>

09:56.080 --> 10:00.720
<i>so you'd have four going out deliberately</i>
<i>trying to score and counter attack.</i>

10:00.800 --> 10:03.240
And the rest of the lads
would back them up

10:03.320 --> 10:06.440
and get ready to defend again
and win it back and off they go and...

10:06.520 --> 10:10.600
Thirty eight percent possession
we had against Ipswich

10:10.680 --> 10:13.680
in my first game in charge,
and we won 5-0.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.960
It was quite surreal, you know.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.280
<i>We were flying that time as a team</i>
<i>and I think we were flying.</i>

10:21.360 --> 10:24.960
<i>Everything we hit was going in.</i>
<i>You know, it was great.</i>

10:25.040 --> 10:26.720
<i>We won 5-0,</i>

10:26.920 --> 10:30.880
<i>and if I remember right, about</i>
<i>three other games went right for us,</i>

10:30.960 --> 10:33.440
<i>that meant that we were top of the league</i>
<i>at the end of that night.</i>

10:33.520 --> 10:36.320
<i>And when they made an announcement,</i>
<i>I think Cardiff had lost</i>

10:36.400 --> 10:39.840
having been 2-0 up,
and Palace were top of the league.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.880
It was a sight for sore eyes,
seeing us up at the top of the league.

10:42.960 --> 10:47.640
What a run. Automatic promotion
suddenly felt very, very real.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.640
Yeah, yeah, we thought that's it. This is
easy and we had to get to the top now.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.880
<i>I think we all started</i>
<i>to think, well... as an investment</i>

10:52.960 --> 10:54.040
<i>Holloway is at exactly the right man.</i>

10:54.120 --> 10:56.960
<i>And a positive person, you know.</i>
<i>He plays a positive brand of football.</i>

10:57.040 --> 11:00.120
<i>You know, he wants to win games</i>
<i>he doesn't wanna grind out draw.</i>

11:00.200 --> 11:01.920
<i>He loves football.</i>
<i>He loves watching football.</i>

11:02.000 --> 11:03.520
<i>Played the way it should be played.</i>

11:07.800 --> 11:08.960
Yeah, I remember.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.760
That's Palace at their peak,
that's how we play.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.200
<i>Zaha. Lovely backheel</i>
<i>into the path of Garvan.</i>

11:16.280 --> 11:19.480
<i>Andre Moritz first-time shot.</i>
<i>That's the equalizer!</i>

11:19.560 --> 11:22.240
<i>Andre Moritz has done it</i>
<i>for Crystal Palace.</i>

11:22.320 --> 11:26.440
Just take our chances,
and honestly we had the wingers to do it.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.760
<i>Three thousand five hundred Eagles fans</i>
<i>erupt. They thoroughly deserve it!</i>

11:30.840 --> 11:33.960
<i>It's Peterborough 1, Crystal Palace 1.</i>

11:34.400 --> 11:37.440
I remember one of our goals
where from their corner.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.760
<i>I ran down the pitch.</i>

11:47.320 --> 11:49.080
And gave it to KG.

11:51.240 --> 11:55.040
<i>It's Dikgacoi! Dikgacoi to win it!</i>
<i>Oh, he's done it!</i>

11:55.400 --> 11:59.200
<i>Kagisho Dikgacoi!</i>
<i>It's two goals in three minutes.</i>

11:59.280 --> 12:02.520
<i>And Crystal Palace surely</i>
<i>going back top of the championship.</i>

12:02.600 --> 12:05.320
<i>If the teams ain't ready at the back,</i>

12:05.400 --> 12:07.320
we'll just run down
the other side of the pitch.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.920
<i>I remember that game like yesterday.</i>

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
<i>My mate, Gab Zakuani</i>
<i>was playing for them.</i>

12:11.080 --> 12:14.440
Then he was like, "Oh, now,
you guys got something there, mate."

12:14.520 --> 12:17.640
You know, 'cause at that time there
we're just playing and enjoying the game.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.040
Then all of a sudden,
it becomes like, "Oh."

12:20.400 --> 12:23.120
When they're saying something there,
what are they talking about?

12:23.200 --> 12:26.000
Can't help being only one thing
that anyone's talking about.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.680
Promotion and up into the Premier League.

12:28.760 --> 12:33.200
<i>That moment there was no one to fear,</i>
<i>I personally did think, "Why not?</i>

12:33.280 --> 12:34.760
"Automatic. Let's go for it."

12:39.000 --> 12:42.680
<i>Looks for Murray who heads it</i>
<i>in at the far post and Palace lead.</i>

12:43.000 --> 12:46.760
<i>I remember his first meeting with us,</i>
<i>because we were playing well.</i>

12:47.200 --> 12:48.280
<i>We were winning games.</i>

12:48.440 --> 12:52.400
He said, "Guys, you're doing brilliant.
Keep going. Keep doing the same things.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.880
I'm not gonna change much.
Little tweaks here and there.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.560
And, yeah, you just carry on what
you're doing. You're doing brilliant."

12:59.280 --> 13:01.480
<i>Murray's header</i>
<i>and Moritz on the volley.</i>

13:01.560 --> 13:03.160
<i>What a terrific goal.</i>

13:03.960 --> 13:06.000
He kind of took the shackles off Wilf

13:06.080 --> 13:08.960
and Yala in particular, Andre Moritz.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.320
He just brought joy into the team as well.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.360
Yeah, this is why I like playing football.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.760
<i>It's Glenn Murray.</i>
<i>Got Zaha ahead of him.</i>

13:21.000 --> 13:24.080
<i>But Murray might go all the way.</i>
<i>He does and it's 3-0.</i>

13:25.000 --> 13:27.480
<i>Glenn Murray cannot stop scoring.</i>

13:38.560 --> 13:41.160
<i>It was brilliant</i>
<i>the way they were set up.</i>

13:41.760 --> 13:46.160
I learned so much. From the first day
I walked in, really unusual situation.

13:46.760 --> 13:51.040
Fantastic confidence. Not arrogance,
a confidence about the place.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.480
They got some brilliant leaders in Jedinak.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.440
<i>I thought Jedinak was outstanding.</i>

13:56.520 --> 13:59.440
As a man, as a leader,
he understood tactics.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.080
He understood what his team was good at.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.400
Mile was kind of the instigator of that.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.840
He was the one that came in here
really early in the morning

14:07.920 --> 14:09.920
and would go through all these routines,
and then after training,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.720
would go through
those same routines as well.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.720
And what it does,
it kind of pulls players along.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.640
Damo starts coming in and doing it,

14:17.720 --> 14:19.240
and Peter Ramage starts
coming in and doing it,

14:19.320 --> 14:21.480
and all those senior players all join him

14:21.560 --> 14:24.920
and then the younger players kind of
see it and they start thinking,

14:25.000 --> 14:26.480
"I better do it
if the senior players are doing it."

14:26.560 --> 14:30.760
All of a sudden, you have this culture
where you don't even have to manage it

14:30.840 --> 14:32.840
because they look
after themselves, really.

14:32.920 --> 14:37.320
The players are
that professional and driven.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.720
Mile was a real believer in me.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.160
A few lads throw themselves in
for a penalty.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.280
But Mile's like, "Muzza's just
taking it." No one argued with him.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.400
<i>I might have missed one,</i>
<i>and he'd be like, Muzza's taking it.</i>

14:46.480 --> 14:49.760
And that for a striker and as a person.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.520
I've got the full backing of my captain
and he believes in me.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.200
<i>He had Dikgacoi next to him</i>
<i>and I realized</i>

14:55.280 --> 14:57.680
<i>how solid that was</i>
<i>and what we needed to do.</i>

14:57.760 --> 15:00.440
We were just so comfortable
at soaking up pressure.

15:00.520 --> 15:04.000
I'm happy for them to keep whipping balls
in and recycling it and going again.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.520
Damo and Rambo just loved it. And then,
KG and Mile sitting in front of them.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.720
They were like rocks.

15:09.800 --> 15:13.600
The more confident the opposition got
and the higher they got up,

15:14.120 --> 15:17.640
that just gave me, Wilfried and Yala
a chance to get in behind and score.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.880
And it was just, "Boys,
your job's to keep the ball out the net

15:19.960 --> 15:21.880
and their job's to just try
and score goals.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.880
<i>You do your job, they'll do theirs,</i>
<i>and we'll win the game."</i>

15:23.960 --> 15:25.680
<i>As simple as that sounds,</i>
<i>that's what it was like.</i>

15:25.760 --> 15:27.920
I remember when he first come in.
He come in to the gym here.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.680
I think we were doing a recovery session
with a few of the boys, and he come in,

15:30.800 --> 15:33.120
and he was loud and full of enthusiasm.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.840
And it was a great appointment
for the football club

15:35.920 --> 15:38.840
because it was, you know, someone
who had been there and done it before.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.000
I remember thinking, "He must be happy

15:42.080 --> 15:44.000
of what he's seeing
in terms of what he's inherited.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.280
<i>He probably can't believe</i>
<i>what he's got here."</i>

15:46.360 --> 15:49.040
<i>What I love about Ian is,</i>
<i>Ian never holds back.</i>

15:49.120 --> 15:52.040
<i>There's never any doubt with you</i>
<i>what Ian's thinking.</i>

15:52.120 --> 15:55.960
For me personally, he just told me
to just carry on expressing myself.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.720
<i>"I don't wanna restrain</i>
<i>the way you play too much."</i>

15:58.800 --> 16:03.000
<i>He added a few bits here and there,</i>
<i>but he just made us believe in ourselves.</i>

16:03.080 --> 16:05.120
I just remember
sort of the energy at the start

16:05.200 --> 16:07.320
and he brought that in at full throttle.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.240
<i>He was great on the training grounds,</i>
<i>had some great ideas,</i>

16:10.520 --> 16:12.880
and was full of enthusiasm, you know.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.280
A great laugh on the training pitch.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.720
He was brilliant. Brilliant to work with.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.600
As well as his being
this kind of exuberant character.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.600
Yes, he knew his stuff as well.
It's well documented.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.520
Obviously, he spent some time in Spain
and studied the game

16:24.600 --> 16:26.120
and you could see
he was a student of the game.

16:26.200 --> 16:30.520
His methods, his training whilst it was
somewhat different to what we were used to

16:30.600 --> 16:34.520
<i>we were all high tempo, high pressing,</i>
<i>and wanted to win the ball and play.</i>

16:34.600 --> 16:35.880
<i>Everyone knows Ian the way he is.</i>

16:35.960 --> 16:39.560
It's all energy and exuberance
about football and the passion and...

16:39.840 --> 16:43.360
Yeah, he brought that in with us and me
and everyone else for that matter.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.640
<i>He's probably the funniest manager</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

16:47.040 --> 16:51.160
I loved him, man, 'cause he was just
straightforward and he was hilarious.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.520
And there are very few people
that make me laugh

16:53.920 --> 16:55.720
and Ian made me laugh every day.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.720
He's a fantastic, fantastic character.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.200
We all knew what he was about.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.280
We had seen all the TV clips
of his dancing,

17:03.360 --> 17:06.520
comes in with his backside cut out
and things like that.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.320
<i>The weirdest thing, I can remember</i>
<i>he had all the players around</i>

17:09.400 --> 17:13.560
and he had said what he needed to say
and then he'd gone out of the room.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.240
"I need to tell them something else."

17:15.320 --> 17:16.640
'Cause he's come bursting back
in the room.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.160
By this stage, the showers are on,
the steam coming in

17:19.240 --> 17:20.440
and he's going through some tactics,

17:20.520 --> 17:22.760
what we didn't do right,
what he was disappointed with.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.000
And he had them all stood around
this sort of kit box.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.240
The magnets were falling off
'cause of the condensation

17:28.320 --> 17:30.480
and he was moving these counters around.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.120
And there were lads just standing there,
just stark naked with just nothing on.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.480
And at the end of it,
he went, "Okay, that's it. Off you go."

17:36.560 --> 17:38.440
<i>I loved working with Ian,</i>
<i>and I'm not just saying that.</i>

17:38.520 --> 17:40.680
<i>I really did. He's such a nice man.</i>

17:40.760 --> 17:42.480
Yeah, go on. Where do you
wanna start with that?

17:42.560 --> 17:44.680
He's just a bundle of energy,
really, you know.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.760
But the one thing I remember
when Holloway came in,

17:46.840 --> 17:49.200
the first thing I thought was,
"He's been promoted before."

17:49.400 --> 17:51.240
So he's not an untried or untested guy

17:51.320 --> 17:53.720
and I was really pleased to see him
come through the door.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.760
And he is energetic, but what a guy.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.400
<i>Massive respect for him.</i>
<i>Like, honestly, really have, I mean...</i>

18:01.040 --> 18:04.320
Sometimes you need a manager
to come in and just carry the team

18:04.400 --> 18:06.600
and he did that to an extent
with his personality.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.440
He's exactly what you think he is.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.840
And I've got so much love for that man.
I really do.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.920
Put his heart and soul into it
and that's all I ever expect from anyone.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.760
And he did. He came in and he just
threw his heart and soul into it,

18:16.840 --> 18:18.480
<i>and I'll always love him for that.</i>

18:18.560 --> 18:22.120
<i>I feel like he just added</i>
<i>enthusiasm into the team.</i>

18:22.200 --> 18:23.520
That liveliness.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.600
Build up on what Dougie had,
with also Ollie's methodology

18:26.680 --> 18:30.520
and Ollie's philosophy,
and it kinda matched and it worked.

18:30.760 --> 18:34.160
We went out there and it was just like,
"We can do this."

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah, Movember. Horrific. I can't...

18:54.080 --> 18:55.880
As you can tell now, I'm trying,

18:55.960 --> 18:58.360
but I can't grow a beard or a facial hair
to save my life.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.200
My 11-year-old nephew's
got a better beard than me.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.280
I think we'd done it the previous year.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.960
<i>David Wright had done</i>
<i>a Movember kind of page,</i>

19:05.080 --> 19:07.840
and we all did it,
and we had some awful taches.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.800
I remember Mile had the railings.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.280
<i>Damo tried to grow something</i>
<i>that was awful.</i>

19:12.360 --> 19:14.600
<i>Andre got the twists.</i>

19:15.120 --> 19:17.320
It was just something
that became a bit of a joke.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.320
But obviously,
there was a serious nature to it,

19:19.400 --> 19:20.880
and for the charities
and things like that,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.920
but it kind of brought back, you know,
the group together as well,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.280
trying to see who could outdo each other
with the most ridiculous taches.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.760
Yeah, I got sucked in by Rambo.
He was my roommate, wasn't he?

19:29.840 --> 19:30.880
I had to show him a bit of support.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.560
I had a little ginger,
kind of rat up on the top lip

19:33.640 --> 19:35.680
<i>which was something I never lived down.</i>

19:37.960 --> 19:40.080
'Cause he can't grow a beard, can he?
He's worse than me.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.200
I think he's got an even
babier face than I have.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.840
Garv's tried.
But that was the thing. He tried.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.480
Everybody bought into it.
Do you know what I mean?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.280
<i>Like, no matter how bad it got,</i>

19:48.360 --> 19:50.160
<i>everybody kind of bought</i>
<i>into what we were trying to do</i>

19:50.240 --> 19:52.160
<i>and we had some laughs with it.</i>

19:58.280 --> 20:01.560
When we put the team together,
what felt slightly special about it

20:01.640 --> 20:04.320
was it kind of felt like that film,
"The Dirty Dozen."

20:04.400 --> 20:06.840
You know,
it felt like the waifs and strays.

20:06.920 --> 20:10.440
Players themselves that were
just full of untapped potential.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.160
The group was a joke. The vibes.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.840
We were just so close.
Everybody was together.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.800
And we all socialized afterwards together.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.760
We went on nights out,
afternoon meals, or...

20:21.840 --> 20:24.280
Whatever we did, we always did together.

20:24.360 --> 20:28.280
That year just felt like
one big gang, I guess.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.960
Going to Jule's restaurant

20:31.040 --> 20:33.400
<i>the day it first opened,</i>
<i>little things like that.</i>

20:33.480 --> 20:35.640
The eclectic mix,
you needed a bit of everything.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.400
<i>Julian was kind of the pillar</i>
<i>that everyone leaned on.</i>

20:38.480 --> 20:39.520
<i>He was almost like a dad figure.</i>

20:39.600 --> 20:41.600
I know a lot of the young lads
did like speaking to Julian.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.400
The kindest man in football.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.280
He booked the table for us,
ordered a bottle of red wine,

20:46.480 --> 20:47.880
to say, to have it with our steaks,

20:47.960 --> 20:50.520
so he was the one that's got me in
for my love of red wine.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.840
Players like Owen Garvan,
Stuart O'Keefe, Moxey.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.680
No one really mentioned at all
that work so hard for the team.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.800
Jonny Parr.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.840
What would we call him?
The perfect human.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.040
I think it was Damo who said,
he's just the perfect human.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.920
<i>He was the kind of kid that, me now</i>
<i>being a father to two young daughters.</i>

21:07.000 --> 21:09.520
If they came back with Jonny Parr,
I'd probably hug Jonny

21:09.600 --> 21:13.240
before he hugged me kids,
'cause he's just an absolute gentlemen.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.400
Even KG. Not really spoken about much.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.960
<i>KG was kind of quiet, but when he spoke,</i>

21:19.040 --> 21:21.800
it was either hilariously funny
or massively poignant.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.840
<i>Silent assassin, I've very rarely</i>
<i>seen him lose it,</i>

21:24.920 --> 21:27.440
<i>but when he did, jeez,</i>
<i>I'd get out of the way with him.</i>

21:27.520 --> 21:30.320
You could go months without talking to KG.
I'm being serious.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.920
Then when he spoke, he kind of home,
and you go,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.920
"Geez, what did he just say?"
It really got you.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
<i>Massively hardworking as well</i>
<i>and such a big part in what we did.</i>

21:38.080 --> 21:40.720
Him and Mile just complemented
each other perfectly.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.840
Andre Moritz, his left foot,
I remember him scoring

21:43.920 --> 21:46.320
two free kicks in one game against Wolves.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.080
Ah, Andre.
The ladies' man of the group.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.480
<i>You know, he could speak</i>
<i>in multiple languages</i>

21:51.560 --> 21:54.680
and you could just send him in
to a group of girls

21:54.760 --> 21:57.760
<i>and just added that kind of spice</i>
<i>to the group</i>

21:57.840 --> 22:00.480
<i>that the young single guys</i>
<i>loved being around</i>

22:00.560 --> 22:04.000
and us older guys, you know,
wanted to be around.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.240
He was just a great person.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.800
And just from that time there,
when I see them, it's like...

22:10.960 --> 22:13.280
if I was to bump into them, I'm buzzing.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.560
I'll tell you what?
That would be the perfect...

22:15.640 --> 22:18.800
Two perfect son-in-laws would be
Jonny Parr and Jonny Williams.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.440
<i>Such a lovable character.</i>
<i>Trying to get him on nights out.</i>

22:21.520 --> 22:24.080
"No, I've to go back, you know.
I've got to play FIFA."

22:24.640 --> 22:27.360
<i>I miss Rambo. He was a great lad.</i>
<i>Really, really nice guy.</i>

22:27.440 --> 22:31.160
And obviously people like Aaron Wilbraham,
who had such a massive role to play,

22:31.520 --> 22:33.680
<i>not just on the pitch but off the pitch.</i>

22:33.760 --> 22:35.280
Just the life and soul
of the dressing room.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.120
We used to call him, what was that,
"Van Wilder: Party Liaison."

22:38.200 --> 22:40.400
I mean, that was, that was Alby.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.520
He was Van Wilder, wasn't he?

22:42.600 --> 22:45.560
<i>Whenever something needed organized,</i>
<i>he was the man to go to.</i>

22:45.640 --> 22:46.760
<i>He knew the right people.</i>

22:46.840 --> 22:49.440
It was like a military operation
and you knew where you needed to be.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.960
I'd have him every year in my team
if I could choose.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.040
Christmas party, one we had at Dublin,
was just all down to Alby.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.640
You know, Paddy was, obviously,
took us back to his hometown.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.400
<i>Yeah, you'd just go out</i>
<i>for a couple of days</i>

22:59.480 --> 23:03.240
and act like, you know, students,
and just get drunk

23:03.320 --> 23:05.160
and have fun and socialize.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.480
<i>A lot older than me,</i>
<i>but he looked after me for that year.</i>

23:08.560 --> 23:12.320
Even the Christmas do, I remember him
telling me to slow down on drinks.

23:12.840 --> 23:16.880
Players with different kind of mind-sets
who bring people together as well

23:16.960 --> 23:19.320
and organise social things
are pivotal

23:19.400 --> 23:22.360
because it creates an atmosphere
that, you know, people wanna be a part of,

23:22.440 --> 23:26.120
and people, you know, wanna go
that extra yard for one another.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.920
You know, for everyone in the building,
Rambo, I felt,

23:29.000 --> 23:30.880
set a standard of work ethic,

23:30.960 --> 23:34.480
<i>commitment, desire,</i>
<i>kind of encapsulate all of that.</i>

23:34.560 --> 23:36.880
<i>He'd do his own job,</i>
<i>but then he'd try and help everyone</i>

23:36.960 --> 23:38.680
<i>in their job</i>
<i>that they were doing as well.</i>

23:38.760 --> 23:41.480
Yoga class, they won't let anyone be late.

23:41.560 --> 23:45.000
Now little things like that
made everyone click.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.400
And I felt like that was part
of building a character for the team.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.600
Because you need that character
in someone that you know.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.880
When he's stood by you,
he will give you 100%.

23:53.960 --> 23:57.640
It was a good atmosphere because
a group of players were put together.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.960
They had a chip on the shoulder
'cause you got people that feel

24:00.040 --> 24:02.800
like they've been hard done by
and wanted to prove a point.

24:02.880 --> 24:06.400
And when you get enough of those people
in your building, good things happen.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.720
It was a group of men that were
willing to work for one another, I think.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.120
All probably from
similar backgrounds as well.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.800
From working-class backgrounds.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.880
Characters that have kind of carried
the club, carried the dressing room.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.720
The work ethic and the culture has always
been about, you know, being together

24:21.800 --> 24:25.360
in a closely-knit squad
which still carries on today.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.360
For some reason, it was the closest group
I've ever been a part of.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.800
Every single one of these people
has got something to prove.

24:32.120 --> 24:36.240
Somebody somewhere thought
that they weren't good enough.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.400
To play alongside that,
to be part of it, to captain them,

24:39.480 --> 24:42.440
<i>to be teammates,</i>
<i>to be mates, to be friends,</i>

24:42.520 --> 24:45.680
I just knew that this group
was really, really special.

25:03.720 --> 25:07.560
It is very difficult to explain
the Brighton rivalry to outsiders,

25:07.640 --> 25:11.640
But it's a very tangible,
sometimes very unpleasant rivalry.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.840
I said I don't understand
the local derby being Brighton

25:14.920 --> 25:18.040
and I should have read up
on what it meant to everybody.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.720
I obviously knew the Millwall,
and there's Charlton, was kinda

25:20.960 --> 25:22.760
you know, South East London and all that.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.080
The one that stands out for me
is obviously the Brighton.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.480
I didn't really understand
the rivalry until...

25:27.560 --> 25:29.680
Till I went to Palace,
I didn't even know there was a rivalry.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.720
It seemed like every week
there was a derby and I do remember

25:31.800 --> 25:34.720
asking at one point, "How many derbies
does this football club have?"

25:34.800 --> 25:36.320
When we went to Charlton
on a Friday night,

25:36.400 --> 25:39.720
we won 1-0 and KG scored,
everyone was like, "That's the big one."

25:39.800 --> 25:42.840
And then couple of weeks later, it was
Millwall and it was, "That's the big one."

25:42.920 --> 25:44.480
And then it was Brighton at home
and it was like,

25:44.560 --> 25:45.680
"No, no, this is the big one."

25:45.760 --> 25:48.160
It goes back
to the football hooliganism days

25:48.240 --> 25:50.640
and there was a lot of trouble
between the sets of fans

25:50.720 --> 25:53.440
<i>and it goes to the fact</i>
<i>that we used to play them a lot.</i>

25:53.520 --> 25:56.840
<i>Whereas clubs like Chelsea</i>
<i>and West Ham or Fulham,</i>

25:56.920 --> 25:58.240
we haven't played them that often.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.280
I remember the build-up to it as well.
Everyone was just talking about,

26:00.360 --> 26:02.360
"You have to beat them.
You have to beat them," you know.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.360
That was the first time
I played Brighton at home

26:04.440 --> 26:06.200
and I did notice a difference
in that game, yeah.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.960
<i>And we are their nearest club.</i>

26:08.040 --> 26:11.800
<i>I know it's a bit of a weird thing</i>
<i>that there's a 50-mile separation.</i>

26:11.880 --> 26:15.760
But in fact, the train from East Croydon
to Brighton only takes half an hour.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.200
So you kind of get into this mode where
you understand what it means to the fans.

26:19.280 --> 26:22.000
But also as a player, you need to
kind of remove yourself from that.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.520
Because if you get caught up
in rivalries and caught up in hatred,

26:25.600 --> 26:29.280
you can get tense and red cards happen
and poor performance happens.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.880
So you kind of remove yourself from that
and stay focused on the game

26:31.960 --> 26:34.280
and say the ultimate gift for the fans
is to win the game,

26:34.360 --> 26:36.400
not for me to do something crazy
and get sent off.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.320
I remember the Brighton one.
That week was like,

26:38.400 --> 26:41.520
"Okay, that's not quite like Millwall
or quite like Charlton."

26:41.600 --> 26:43.160
This was important.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.880
So I just thought, "Okay, fair enough.
Another derby. We have to go and win it."

26:47.600 --> 26:50.880
<i>It's the biggest day in the calendar</i>
<i>for both these sets of supporters.</i>

26:50.960 --> 26:53.480
<i>This fixture always has plenty of bites,</i>

26:53.560 --> 26:56.440
<i>but today there is</i>
<i>an added intensity, perhaps.</i>

26:56.520 --> 26:59.480
<i>Palace a point off</i>
<i>top spot in the championship.</i>

26:59.560 --> 27:01.880
<i>Brighton just outside the play-offs.</i>

27:01.960 --> 27:05.160
<i>It's a recipe for a really memorable day.</i>

27:06.760 --> 27:10.400
<i>That's a bit awkward for Dunk</i>
<i>who catches Bolasie</i>

27:10.480 --> 27:13.000
<i>and the referee is gonna show</i>
<i>a red card here.</i>

27:13.080 --> 27:16.480
<i>It's Garvan. That's not far away.</i>

27:17.720 --> 27:21.480
<i>Murray's header!</i>
<i>Palace in front. Glenn Murray.</i>

27:24.240 --> 27:26.280
<i>Now that's a decent save by Speroni.</i>

27:26.360 --> 27:28.800
<i>Mackail-Smith against the upright.</i>

27:30.120 --> 27:31.640
<i>Kuszczak has brought done Glenn Murray</i>

27:31.720 --> 27:33.800
<i>and that's a penalty,</i>
<i>no matter what he says.</i>

27:34.360 --> 27:36.440
<i>Murray converts. It's 2-0.</i>

27:36.920 --> 27:39.320
<i>Murray for a hat trick. Over the top.</i>

27:40.720 --> 27:43.600
<i>Oh, that's a push by Greer</i>
<i>on Murray. Penalty.</i>

27:44.200 --> 27:46.240
<i>Garvan this time. No mistake.</i>

27:47.000 --> 27:48.200
<i>3-0, Palace lead.</i>

27:48.720 --> 27:51.440
<i>The lads were completely fantastic.</i>

27:51.520 --> 27:54.040
<i>You know, the whole set-up here</i>
<i>is geared to being professional</i>

27:54.120 --> 27:56.000
<i>and every week they go out</i>
<i>and do the same thing.</i>

27:56.080 --> 27:58.680
I think the biggest thing
that they all realize is that

27:58.760 --> 28:00.920
start of season, they couldn't win a game.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.840
<i>And I think that is driving them on</i>
<i>and it's just a pleasure to be with them.</i>

28:04.920 --> 28:06.080
<i>I'm thoroughly enjoying it.</i>

28:06.160 --> 28:09.680
I don't think people realize how good
some of these players actually are.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.080
<i>I do, and while I'm working with them,</i>

28:11.160 --> 28:13.080
<i>I'd just like to thank them</i>
<i>for how good they are.</i>

28:14.320 --> 28:16.560
You know, Dougie must have kicked himself
going to Bolton

28:16.640 --> 28:18.440
and leaving me with that team,

28:18.520 --> 28:21.840
<i>the team in his vein,</i>
<i>the way he wanted them to play,</i>

28:21.920 --> 28:23.200
<i>and they were so good at it.</i>

28:23.280 --> 28:27.080
<i>Great rundown the right from Bolasie</i>
<i>and he picks out Glenn Murray</i>

28:27.160 --> 28:30.400
<i>who gets his 19th</i>
<i>in 19 games this season.</i>

28:30.480 --> 28:33.840
<i>That's two weeks in a row where we've</i>
<i>got ourselves in a winning position.</i>

28:33.920 --> 28:37.080
<i>We didn't see it through,</i>
<i>but I'm still very pleased with my team.</i>

28:37.160 --> 28:40.400
<i>Clayton's penalty.</i>
<i>Oh, easy for Speroni. Too easy.</i>

28:40.960 --> 28:43.760
<i>It is Beckford.</i>
<i>Another good save by Speroni.</i>

28:45.760 --> 28:49.000
<i>Bolasie rides the challenge. Finds Zaha.</i>

28:50.400 --> 28:53.960
<i>Tries his luck and scores</i>
<i>a brilliant goal for Crystal Palace.</i>

28:54.240 --> 28:55.600
<i>Wilfried Zaha.</i>

28:56.040 --> 28:58.200
<i>Bolasie's clever flick</i>

28:58.280 --> 29:00.680
<i>and the impossible angle,</i>
<i>but what a finish.</i>

29:07.920 --> 29:12.480
All those in this room that think
Wilfried should play for England,

29:12.560 --> 29:15.200
please shout as loud
as you can now, please.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.640
Has that persuaded you?

29:23.200 --> 29:24.600
Not really, to be honest.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.720
<i>Being called up for England's massive.</i>

29:27.800 --> 29:31.080
<i>That's me jumping over</i>
<i>how many Premiership players.</i>

29:31.400 --> 29:33.000
<i>That's always gonna be</i>
<i>a big achievement</i>

29:33.080 --> 29:34.280
<i>for me playing for England</i>

29:34.880 --> 29:36.280
from the championship.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.880
<i>For Wilf, obviously,</i>
<i>that was where he was born</i>

29:46.960 --> 29:49.200
<i>and that's where he wants to play,</i>
<i>and I'm happy for him</i>

29:49.320 --> 29:50.680
that he does the things
that he wants to do.

29:50.760 --> 29:55.440
I would never think we did enough
to see Wilfried Zaha in an England shirt.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.080
He's just turned 20

29:59.160 --> 30:01.720
and I think everybody was bursting
with pride at the football club.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.000
<i>He's come on leaps and bounds</i>
<i>and he, I mean,</i>

30:03.080 --> 30:05.680
some of the tricks he does in training,
blows your mind away.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.640
I mean, I've been
on the end of a couple myself

30:07.720 --> 30:09.400
and it's just like, "Oops."

30:09.480 --> 30:11.560
<i>It's more the person he is,</i>
<i>he's a wonderful kid.</i>

30:11.680 --> 30:14.320
Absolutely genuine, honest.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.160
Lovely, innocent kid.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.440
<i>We were very proud of Wilfried Zaha</i>

30:18.520 --> 30:20.480
<i>then you see him this season</i>
<i>do these things that...</i>

30:20.720 --> 30:23.520
<i>Well, the only response</i>
<i>to what he's done is laughter.</i>

30:23.600 --> 30:25.880
<i>Did you see that? He's doing it again.</i>

30:25.960 --> 30:27.960
Truly, truly exceptional talent.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.560
Even when he wasn't at his best,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.760
<i>he just terrified the other side.</i>

30:34.840 --> 30:38.480
He just plays football. There you go.
He just happens to be really good.

30:38.560 --> 30:41.200
He's a special player.
He's a really special player

30:41.280 --> 30:43.280
<i>and he's got special physical attributes.</i>

30:43.880 --> 30:45.720
<i>Pace, power, trickery.</i>

30:47.120 --> 30:49.640
<i>Zaha was in the news all the time.</i>

30:49.720 --> 30:51.920
<i>And then you go</i>
<i>on the rumour mills online</i>

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
<i>and he'd always be in the mentions.</i>

30:57.960 --> 31:00.560
<i>When I look back on some of the games,</i>

31:00.640 --> 31:03.480
<i>you forget how sensational he was,</i>
<i>Wilfried at times.</i>

31:03.600 --> 31:06.360
<i>They just couldn't live with him</i>
<i>in that division at all.</i>

31:06.440 --> 31:09.200
<i>We were one down,</i>
<i>I think he made three subs,</i>

31:09.280 --> 31:11.400
<i>and then Wilfried is set free.</i>

31:11.480 --> 31:14.760
<i>I mean, he runs from his own half</i>
<i>for this second goal.</i>

31:14.840 --> 31:16.120
<i>We won the game.</i>

31:16.440 --> 31:19.840
<i>Darren Ferguson rang Sir Alex and said,</i>

31:19.920 --> 31:22.280
<i>"You've got to sign this kid.</i>
<i>He's unbelievable."</i>

31:22.600 --> 31:24.840
I just heard about that conversation.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.160
This scene sounds crazy to me,
to be honest.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.520
Like me going to Manchester United,
it sounds crazy,

31:29.600 --> 31:32.280
but Sir Alex Ferguson
actually wanted to speak to me.

31:32.360 --> 31:36.080
That's when I thought,
"Wow. This is the real deal."

31:36.160 --> 31:41.520
Like, probably the best manager
in history, actually wants me at his club.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.640
When a club like Manchester United
come in for one of your players,

31:44.920 --> 31:46.720
the only thing you can do is manage it.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.760
For a kid like Wilf to have the chance
to go to Man United,

31:49.840 --> 31:52.800
you can't stop that dream happening.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.560
We accepted it was gonna happen.
I think we got a pretty good fee.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.400
I negotiated that with David Gill.
It was very good negotiation.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.520
<i>We did it over breakfast.</i>
<i>He offered five million.</i>

32:01.600 --> 32:03.960
I said, "Look, if a player's good enough
to play for Man United,

32:04.040 --> 32:05.920
he's worth ten million.
It's as simple as that."

32:06.000 --> 32:08.160
Then it was 10 million,
plus 5 million of add-ons.

32:08.240 --> 32:12.920
The key thing, obviously, was getting
the six-month loan, so he stayed with us.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.400
<i>And I agreed.</i>

32:19.880 --> 32:21.960
It's me that asked for it

32:22.040 --> 32:24.000
'cause I wanted to finish
the season with Palace

32:24.080 --> 32:26.480
because it's like we started something.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.760
We have the opportunity
to get to the Prem.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.400
How long has Palace
not been in the Prem and how...

32:32.480 --> 32:35.560
It will make such a big difference
for our community.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.560
Like the area,
it gives everyone such a lift.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.880
Being in the Premier League,
having all the big teams come down,

32:41.960 --> 32:43.880
and everyone comes to watch,
and it's enjoyable.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.640
So I was just part of that journey
and I thought, you know what...

32:46.720 --> 32:49.000
My dream move has come,

32:49.080 --> 32:52.200
but I feel like I owe it to the club
to come back and finish this off.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.160
There were a lot of Palace fans
who weren't

33:08.280 --> 33:09.280
prepared to give Holloway a chance

33:09.360 --> 33:11.080
'cause they thought
Freedman had been forced out.

33:11.160 --> 33:14.640
<i>They couldn't accept that Dougie Freedman</i>
<i>could have just walked out.</i>

33:15.720 --> 33:17.400
That was difficult for Holloway as well.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.880
<i>This cross looks for Murray!</i>

33:20.680 --> 33:22.320
<i>Reid with a strike.</i>

33:23.880 --> 33:26.840
<i>That's Murray's header and it snuck in.</i>

33:27.680 --> 33:29.000
<i>Oh, and Sharp!</i>

33:29.640 --> 33:31.840
<i>And he's equalized, 2-2.</i>

33:31.920 --> 33:37.120
I think fans love it
when the players are from the academy

33:37.200 --> 33:39.400
and they love it
when the manager's an ex-player.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.840
<i>And Dougie's obviously a great guy.</i>

33:40.920 --> 33:42.960
<i>He's done some fantastic things</i>
<i>for Palace.</i>

33:43.040 --> 33:45.200
<i>He's a man that Palace fans love.</i>

33:55.520 --> 33:58.000
There were still a few
Palace fans then who thought,

33:58.480 --> 34:00.720
"He's all mouth and no trousers.
He's all sound bites.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.560
He's all happy-go-lucky."

34:04.080 --> 34:07.480
And obviously, Ian hadn't got
any Palace connections.

34:07.880 --> 34:11.280
So I think it was difficult
replacing a favourite.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.560
<i>And there were pockets of fans</i>
<i>that weren't happy.</i>

34:19.760 --> 34:23.600
In the January, I knew
that we had a chance.

34:24.160 --> 34:27.360
But we had a big deficit by this point.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.720
Ian still wanted to move the squad more

34:29.800 --> 34:31.840
in the direction of how he wanted to play.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.360
<i>But he also wanted Stephen Dobbie</i>
<i>and Jazz Richards</i>

34:34.440 --> 34:35.600
<i>and they were good ones.</i>

34:35.680 --> 34:40.080
And I needed to put some more money in
and I needed to ask my friends

34:40.160 --> 34:42.240
that'd come along for the ride
to put some more money.

34:42.320 --> 34:46.720
I went to Jeremy's hotel,
sat down with the guys,

34:46.800 --> 34:48.680
and I said, "Look, I need some more money,

34:48.760 --> 34:50.640
because we may never have
this chance again."

35:07.040 --> 35:10.600
<i>I think at most I ever went was probably</i>
<i>four or five games without a goal.</i>

35:10.680 --> 35:12.880
<i>All in all, I got promoted five times.</i>

35:13.280 --> 35:17.040
<i>So I got promoted with Sunderland,</i>
<i>West Brom, Leicester.</i>

35:18.920 --> 35:22.640
And, blimey, I think I've played
with nine clubs now.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.000
Oh, and Birmingham.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.520
So I think I'm the player
with the most promotions

35:26.600 --> 35:28.480
out the championship
to the Premier League.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.600
<i>Started at Watford,</i>
<i>started to make a name for myself</i>

35:31.680 --> 35:32.680
<i>and then moved to Sunderland.</i>

35:32.760 --> 35:34.480
<i>And then the first four years</i>
<i>at Sunderland</i>

35:34.560 --> 35:36.680
<i>were just incredible, really.</i>

35:36.840 --> 35:38.960
<i>And I suppose that's where</i>
<i>I put my name on the map.</i>

35:39.680 --> 35:41.640
<i>I'd heard about Ian Holloway</i>
<i>and his antics,</i>

35:41.720 --> 35:44.880
<i>so I was really looking forward</i>
<i>to joining them and playing for him.</i>

35:44.960 --> 35:48.640
For me, it was fantastic. He's up there
with one of the best I'd played under.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.880
He's also got that crazy side to him

35:50.960 --> 35:54.880
where, you know, some of his antics
during training session

35:54.960 --> 35:56.520
and you just end up laughing.

35:56.600 --> 36:00.760
But he was deadly serious
and he was so passionate about football.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.480
<i>You know, it was made clear that</i>
<i>I was gonna be leaving Blackpool.</i>

36:03.560 --> 36:06.920
<i>And Ollie sold it to me,</i>
<i>an incredible place to play football.</i>

36:07.000 --> 36:08.120
<i>The noise.</i>

36:08.200 --> 36:10.800
<i>You know, when them lot get going.</i>
<i>they always say about the 12th man,</i>

36:10.880 --> 36:12.200
<i>but he is like having the 12th man.</i>

36:12.280 --> 36:14.640
Obviously, when I've seen
where Palace were in the League,

36:14.720 --> 36:18.680
I can go there and help them get promotion
and put another promotion on my CV.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.880
<i>Once I got down there, you know, I was</i>
<i>more than happy to put pen to paper.</i>

36:22.960 --> 36:27.600
I felt threatened by it. I obviously knew
that Kevin had worked with Ian before.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.560
That worried me a little bit.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.000
In the end, Kevin came in
and he helped me more than anything.

36:33.080 --> 36:37.120
I think at his age,
I say that now at my age, his age then,

36:37.200 --> 36:40.520
I think he was happy coming off the bench
and scoring goals like he did for us.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.800
<i>When you saw Bolasie one side</i>
<i>and Zaha the other side,</i>

36:43.880 --> 36:46.520
<i>Glenn Murray, you just think,</i>
<i>"There's goals there."</i>

36:46.600 --> 36:48.680
If I can get in that squad,
I'll score and...

36:48.760 --> 36:51.880
<i>A delight to play with those players</i>
<i>'cause they were exciting players.</i>

37:01.960 --> 37:03.240
I'd say it would be, yeah,

37:03.320 --> 37:05.040
'cause he used to always try
and change things.

37:05.120 --> 37:08.920
'Cause I'm a bit loud and gregarious
on the training ground.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.920
I like a laugh. I like a joke.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.400
I like to try and get people
to relax in what they do

37:14.840 --> 37:18.680
and enjoy what they're doing
rather than be too military,

37:18.760 --> 37:20.800
if you know what I mean,
but that's what they were used to.

37:20.880 --> 37:25.040
So I went back to a little bit of that
and I felt they appreciated it.

37:25.120 --> 37:29.160
And if you ask them, I'm sure they would
say, "Yeah, we needed to," you know.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.320
<i>Dobbie pokes it out wide to Moxey,</i>
<i>left hand side,</i>

37:31.400 --> 37:34.400
<i>oh chance now for Murray</i>
<i>for Palace! It's 1-1!</i>

37:36.160 --> 37:37.200
<i>Glenn Murray!</i>

37:37.280 --> 37:39.960
<i>who scores his 24th goal of the season.</i>

37:42.360 --> 37:44.720
<i>He was an experienced manager</i>
<i>and he was a clever guy.</i>

37:44.800 --> 37:47.160
It must have been difficult for him,
but I suppose when you're winning games,

37:47.240 --> 37:51.000
you compromise your beliefs
because this is such a well-oiled machine.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.800
<i>You need to keep this moving,</i>
<i>and he did that brilliantly.</i>

37:52.880 --> 37:54.240
<i>Jonny's bundled</i>
<i>over the line. Is it?</i>

37:54.320 --> 37:56.360
<i>No, it's still alive</i>
<i>and it has gone in now.</i>

37:56.480 --> 37:58.640
<i>The final touch came from Peter Ramage.</i>

37:58.720 --> 38:01.400
<i>Across the face it goes,</i>
<i>Phillips scores.</i>

38:01.480 --> 38:04.600
<i>Crystal Palace has equalized. It's 2-2.</i>

38:04.680 --> 38:08.480
<i>And it's Kevin Phillips.</i>
<i>Watford 2, Crystal Palace 2.</i>

38:08.560 --> 38:12.080
<i>I think Ian's, how he's seeing things</i>
<i>from an attacking point of view</i>

38:12.160 --> 38:14.480
you know, kept you ready,
kept you wanting to do more

38:14.560 --> 38:17.400
and kept you wanting
to be part of that journey.

38:17.480 --> 38:20.360
I love the way Ian,
the way he sees football. I love it.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.720
<i>That's how I grew up, actually,</i>
<i>playing back home in Argentina.</i>

38:22.800 --> 38:25.760
<i>The way you kick the ball, the way</i>
<i>the players move around the pitch,</i>

38:25.840 --> 38:27.720
<i>I love that style of football.</i>

38:27.840 --> 38:31.440
<i>Like I said, I was having</i>
<i>a fantastic time with the whole group.</i>

38:31.520 --> 38:35.200
<i>Some of the best moments of my career,</i>
<i>I can say, were in that season.</i>

38:35.280 --> 38:36.400
<i>Here's Murray.</i>

38:37.680 --> 38:40.600
<i>Oh, yes, what a goal from Glenn Murray.</i>

38:41.600 --> 38:43.000
<i>Ian Holloway enjoyed that one.</i>

38:43.400 --> 38:46.640
I've never ever hit the target from
outside the box with my left foot before.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.120
<i>That is the best goal I've scored.</i>

38:48.200 --> 38:51.680
<i>I was right behind it thinking,</i>
<i>don't shoot from there, Muzz.</i>

38:52.360 --> 38:53.600
<i>That was unbelievable.</i>

38:53.680 --> 38:56.040
<i>And here's Phillips. Oh, he's got it in.</i>

38:56.120 --> 38:59.320
<i>Kevin Phillips showing why</i>
<i>he's been brought to Selhurst Park.</i>

38:59.400 --> 39:02.640
<i>From what we have built together,</i>
<i>it was just a proper team.</i>

39:02.720 --> 39:05.000
<i>Obviously, Ian had a big part</i>
<i>to play in that.</i>

39:05.080 --> 39:06.160
<i>Jedinak.</i>

39:07.440 --> 39:11.320
<i>To find Murray. Oh, that's another</i>
<i>clinical finish by Glenn Murray.</i>

39:11.720 --> 39:13.600
<i>Here's Dobbie. Oh, what a hit.</i>

39:14.200 --> 39:17.200
<i>What a brilliant way to open</i>
<i>your account for your new club.</i>

39:25.480 --> 39:27.920
<i>Here's Phillips. He gets it in.</i>

39:28.360 --> 39:30.520
<i>Phillips strikes it and it's his second.</i>

39:31.080 --> 39:34.520
<i>As a young kid, watching him finish.</i>
<i>It's amazing, really.</i>

39:34.600 --> 39:35.840
<i>That's the pick of the bunch.</i>

39:36.480 --> 39:38.720
<i>And Zaha makes it four.</i>

39:38.800 --> 39:40.480
<i>Palace running riot.</i>

39:40.560 --> 39:42.400
<i>It's five wins from seven.</i>

39:42.480 --> 39:44.720
<i>Cracked towards the far post</i>
<i>and Glenn Murray</i>

39:44.800 --> 39:46.920
<i>heads in the first goal of the game.</i>

39:47.360 --> 39:51.560
<i>Delaney, angle ball. Here's Murray.</i>
<i>30 goals for this season.</i>

39:51.640 --> 39:54.440
<i>That was magical, once in a career thing.</i>

39:54.520 --> 39:58.360
<i>Thirty goals in a season</i>
<i>and there's still nine games to go.</i>

39:58.440 --> 40:02.480
<i>Ian Holloway is not happy,</i>
<i>frustration written all over his face.</i>

40:02.600 --> 40:05.840
<i>Waving some of his players away</i>
<i>from the official.</i>

40:05.920 --> 40:07.720
<i>He's got a few things to say himself.</i>

40:07.800 --> 40:09.480
<i>It was to get my players</i>
<i>away from the referee.</i>

40:09.560 --> 40:11.880
<i>I'm gonna go and have a word</i>
<i>in a minute legally when I can.</i>

40:12.400 --> 40:14.080
<i>Thought he was absolutely diabolical.</i>

40:14.440 --> 40:16.640
<i>And I thought Luke Varney</i>
<i>should have been sent off.</i>

40:16.720 --> 40:18.840
<i>Presuming that's for when he tumbled over</i>

40:18.920 --> 40:19.960
<i>in the area</i>
<i>and there's no contact whatsoever.</i>

40:20.040 --> 40:22.400
<i>No, he's got a yellow card for that,</i>
<i>but the tackle on Jonny Williams,</i>

40:22.480 --> 40:24.880
the deliberate tackle from behind,
that's a yellow card.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.120
Thought the referee was
absolutely diabolical today.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.960
<i>He's a very emotional person</i>
<i>when he wears his heart on his sleeve.</i>

40:30.040 --> 40:32.280
<i>And he'll tell you how it is,</i>
<i>and he shows his emotions.</i>

40:32.360 --> 40:34.160
I've seen him in tears in meetings.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.600
And he just can't help himself.
That's the way he is, and...

40:36.680 --> 40:38.120
You know,
whether you agree with it or not,

40:38.200 --> 40:39.480
whether you should be showing players

40:39.560 --> 40:42.240
that you're crying or that emotional,
but that's just the way he is,

40:42.320 --> 40:43.920
and that's why he's been successful.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.960
I certainly knew what I was expecting
when I went down there,

40:47.040 --> 40:48.320
so it didn't surprise me.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.520
Many a games where he would
get emotional on the touchline.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.880
He wouldn't shut up.
The amount of times at Blackpool

40:53.960 --> 40:58.120
because obviously the noise wasn't as loud
at Bloomfield as it was at Selhurst.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.320
You could hear him ranting and raving
at the Fourth Official.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.720
At times, I felt sorry
for the Fourth Official.

41:03.800 --> 41:07.320
<i>But that was just the way Ollie was</i>
<i>and that's the way he'll always be.</i>

41:10.080 --> 41:11.920
<i>Ian certainly brought a new energy.</i>

41:12.040 --> 41:14.440
For a while, we just got even better.

41:14.520 --> 41:18.040
A combination
of that kind of solidity with Ian's,

41:18.120 --> 41:21.040
sort of joie de vivre
and gung-ho attitude,

41:21.120 --> 41:23.560
Ian tried to change too much.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.640
And it might have worked. We certainly
had some more expansive players.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.600
Ian was a lot less structured than Dougie.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.080
You know, he would have watched Barcelona
in a Champions League that night

41:31.160 --> 41:33.120
and would come in and have these ideas.

41:33.200 --> 41:37.800
He did say, in his west country accent,
"I want them to play like Barcelona."

41:37.880 --> 41:41.600
And, of course, we didn't have players
to play like Barcelona.

41:41.680 --> 41:45.160
He was trying to mould the team
into his style

41:45.240 --> 41:47.280
and move it away from Dougie's style.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.040
The lads had to realize that,
you know, there was a new manager

41:50.120 --> 41:52.400
and, you know,
Dougie was no longer here now.

41:52.480 --> 41:54.200
We couldn't keep referring back to Dougie.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.000
And Ian was the manager
and we had to embrace it.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.040
I don't think people realize
the difference in style

41:58.120 --> 42:00.320
in people's training and meetings.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.800
Everybody does them differently.

42:01.880 --> 42:05.640
Mine were a little bit, well,
very different to what they were used to.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.000
<i>You take everything on board</i>

42:07.080 --> 42:10.040
<i>and your interpretation of something</i>
<i>might be slightly different.</i>

42:10.120 --> 42:13.240
<i>Although some might have thought we</i>
<i>probably could have done it another way,</i>

42:13.320 --> 42:15.640
<i>we still gave it the opportunity.</i>

42:15.720 --> 42:19.720
I was asked to change the style of play
into having more of the ball.

42:19.800 --> 42:23.000
<i>'Cause I wanted to switch it,</i>
<i>but I wanna go in behind people</i>

42:23.080 --> 42:26.920
in a disguised long ball and then
get our runners on the end of that.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.360
<i>Damien Delaney dropped them right off</i>
<i>to have it and play</i>

42:29.480 --> 42:31.240
<i>and hit some long diagonal.</i>

42:31.320 --> 42:34.640
<i>He got a wonderful left foot.</i>
<i>He could hit diagonals all day long.</i>

42:34.720 --> 42:38.680
So our wide man would have had the ball
over and over and over again?

42:38.760 --> 42:42.360
We started having more possession,
but results then just turned against us.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.960
<i>Palace can go second</i>
<i>if they win this one.</i>

43:02.080 --> 43:06.680
<i>Brighton still smarting from that</i>
<i>big defeat at Selhurst before Christmas.</i>

43:07.800 --> 43:10.400
<i>Here's Wilfried Zaha. And Parr.</i>

43:11.200 --> 43:15.000
It was pretty even
and then just suddenly, we were behind.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.280
<i>And everything went right for them.</i>

43:19.080 --> 43:21.000
<i>And Ulloa gets there.</i>

43:21.840 --> 43:23.480
<i>And Brighton are ahead.</i>

43:25.000 --> 43:26.760
<i>We had the better chances.</i>

43:26.840 --> 43:29.080
<i>They scored,</i>
<i>then they scored another free kick.</i>

43:29.480 --> 43:30.720
<i>And it's 2-0.</i>

43:32.960 --> 43:36.600
<i>That was probably the worst day</i>
<i>of the whole season, I would say, for me.</i>

43:39.120 --> 43:40.840
<i>And game over, surely.</i>

43:42.040 --> 43:45.040
I remember that game.
They beat us like it was a training drill.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.040
They were so smug about it.

43:47.120 --> 43:50.080
<i>Then obviously the abuse</i>
<i>from some of the Seagulls fans</i>

43:50.160 --> 43:51.360
poured in and you just thought,

43:51.440 --> 43:54.080
"Oh, our confidence
has been knocked today."

43:54.160 --> 43:57.720
<i>It's always sad to lose to Brighton,</i>
<i>but we just didn't turn up that game...</i>

43:58.040 --> 44:01.440
The only plus point was that
nobody else seemed to want to get out

44:01.520 --> 44:03.800
of that division
because everybody was having a bad run.

44:03.880 --> 44:08.960
So I was never really worried until
the Birmingham game over Easter.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.240
<i>I believe we are a Premiership club.</i>

44:13.320 --> 44:15.080
<i>We should definitely be there</i>
<i>next season, I think we've...</i>

44:15.160 --> 44:16.960
<i>What we've got here</i>
<i>is something quite special.</i>

44:17.040 --> 44:19.320
Hopefully second.

44:19.400 --> 44:21.560
We're a play-off club.
We always go up through the play-offs.

44:21.640 --> 44:22.800
We normally finish sixth.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.960
So if we win we go above Watford,
so we'd be certain to go third.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.600
And Hull, who are second,
they're three points ahead of us.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.240
<i>This is the best it's been</i>
<i>for a long while</i>

44:33.320 --> 44:36.200
<i>considering where we are</i>
<i>at this stage of the season now.</i>

44:36.280 --> 44:37.760
<i>No one predicted this</i>
<i>at the start of the season.</i>

44:37.840 --> 44:40.480
<i>You would've been happy with mid-table,</i>
<i>but now having been where we are,</i>

44:40.560 --> 44:42.800
we've got a 30-goal striker in the team

44:42.880 --> 44:44.800
and the likes of Zaha and Williams now

44:44.880 --> 44:47.000
breaking through
into international level.

44:47.080 --> 44:49.600
<i>You're not gonna get many opportunities,</i>
<i>like that to go up.</i>

44:51.600 --> 44:54.520
Selhurst Park, would you please welcome
the mascots, match officials,

44:54.600 --> 44:56.920
and your two teams, Birmingham City

44:57.000 --> 45:00.640
and the pride of South London,
Crystal Palace!

45:10.480 --> 45:12.760
<i>He's still going</i>
<i>and getting the shot away</i>

45:12.840 --> 45:14.440
<i>and beating Speroni.</i>

45:14.760 --> 45:16.560
<i>It's 1-0 to Birmingham.</i>

45:19.920 --> 45:21.600
<i>Oh, that's an own goal.</i>

45:21.680 --> 45:24.360
<i>Delaney has headed in</i>
<i>past his own goalkeeper.</i>

45:24.640 --> 45:26.360
<i>It's 2-0 to Birmingham.</i>

45:33.480 --> 45:36.880
<i>Finds Dobbie, and Butland gets down</i>
<i>to his left</i>

45:37.000 --> 45:39.400
<i>with full stretch to turn it away.</i>

45:39.480 --> 45:42.680
<i>This finds Morrison who makes it 3-0.</i>

45:43.560 --> 45:47.440
<i>Crystal Palace unravelling again.</i>
<i>Ian Holloway can't watch.</i>

45:50.280 --> 45:52.800
<i>It's Ferguson.</i>
<i>Great strike, into the net.</i>

45:53.120 --> 45:54.520
<i>It's 4-0.</i>

46:01.960 --> 46:04.680
<i>Those Birmingham City fans are delirious.</i>

46:04.960 --> 46:07.280
<i>The rest of Selhurst Park, silenced.</i>

46:14.080 --> 46:16.280
Shocking. Shocking, shocking.

46:16.360 --> 46:18.200
There’s something wrong there.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.200
We'd be lucky
to make it to the play-offs in that form.

46:20.280 --> 46:23.200
We've been playing most of the season
with one upfront and pack the midfield

46:23.280 --> 46:26.160
and he seems to have changed it to try
and get goals and it's just made it worse.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.040
I just hope that
the wheels haven't come off

46:28.120 --> 46:30.080
because the Brighton game's bad enough,
letting three there,

46:30.160 --> 46:32.680
letting four again,
letting seven goals in two games

46:32.760 --> 46:35.160
and we haven't scored one,
it's bit worrying.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.440
<i>We're a very good team.</i>
<i>We've been excellent at home.</i>

46:39.640 --> 46:42.400
<i>We got beat last week.</i>
<i>I couldn't wait for today and...</i>

46:42.680 --> 46:44.760
We started brightly,
got in behind them a couple of times

46:44.840 --> 46:47.000
and then they scored a goal
and it knocked the stuffing

46:47.080 --> 46:49.480
out of every single body out there.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.760
And that's unusual.
I didn't expect to see that.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.400
They absolutely battered us that night.

46:53.480 --> 46:57.360
And I remember being in the dressing room
afterwards. Everyone was low.

46:57.440 --> 47:01.120
It was bit of a nervous time
and the play-offs had looked pretty likely

47:01.200 --> 47:03.000
and suddenly were looking a bit unlikely.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.680
Ah, the wheels were coming off
around that time. Yeah, I remember that.

47:05.760 --> 47:09.240
Such a high, and then came crashing down
to a low, but that's football.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.880
It was so bad that
you thought well that's...

47:10.960 --> 47:12.520
we've got that out of our system surely.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.160
It was a long time
before we had another win.

47:15.440 --> 47:18.040
In the end, we weren't just getting
beaten, we were getting thrashed.

47:18.240 --> 47:21.320
Something that seemed almost certain,
certain we would be in the play-offs.

47:21.400 --> 47:23.800
I mean, we thought we would get
automatic one point,

47:23.880 --> 47:25.760
but we'd certainly be in the play-offs,

47:25.880 --> 47:27.520
just looked like it was slipping away.

47:27.600 --> 47:30.040
The way that Ian Holloway, the gaffer,
wanted us to play at that time

47:30.120 --> 47:31.760
was kind of open and expansive.

47:31.840 --> 47:33.840
You know, with Ollie having
played with him at Blackpool,

47:33.920 --> 47:36.680
you know, that was his style,
that was the way he liked to play.

47:36.760 --> 47:41.400
You know, there come point in times
in games where we all had a switch.

47:41.480 --> 47:45.480
Let's go back to what we know
what we do best.

47:45.560 --> 47:46.880
And that would just be between the boys.

47:46.960 --> 47:49.400
Listen, we can hear what he's saying
and we understand,

47:49.480 --> 47:52.320
but we're the ones
at the end of the day on the pitch.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.480
Yeah, there was remarks. There was...

47:54.720 --> 47:58.520
You know, players had meetings
when managers and coaches ain't around.

47:58.960 --> 48:02.320
You have to make decisions on the pitch
by yourself sometimes.

48:02.400 --> 48:04.240
It wasn't because
we were trying to disrespect Ollie.

48:04.320 --> 48:06.520
Maybe it's what we felt
that was needed at the time.

48:06.600 --> 48:07.800
We're experienced players as well.

48:07.880 --> 48:09.720
We have the feel
of what's going on in the game.

48:09.800 --> 48:13.360
Obviously, you need the manager to
help you during games and stuff like that,

48:13.440 --> 48:16.400
but that's a split second decision
that we make collectively.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.720
We all as a group
take responsibility for that

48:18.800 --> 48:21.800
whether we win or whether we don't get
the result that we want.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.240
Us as players, you know, we have to take
that responsibility as well

48:25.320 --> 48:27.720
to make sure that we're doing our job.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.880
Whether that's right or wrong,
as a coach now,

48:31.720 --> 48:34.840
I'd probably be like Ollie and a little
bit, you know, cheesed at that.

48:34.920 --> 48:37.600
It's no reflection of management
if a team is self-managing.

48:37.680 --> 48:40.920
This means you got
a really good group of players

48:41.320 --> 48:43.320
that have their beliefs
and their principles

48:43.400 --> 48:45.880
and they stick to them,
and whenever we felt we were going away

48:45.960 --> 48:47.480
from them, we had some good senior players

48:47.560 --> 48:49.360
who could get us back on track
pretty quickly.

48:49.440 --> 48:51.160
When we did do that, it was always,

48:51.240 --> 48:54.120
"I know Dougie's got you doing this,
but I need you doing that."

48:54.200 --> 48:56.360
It wasn't us trying to be
disrespectful to Ollie,

48:56.440 --> 48:57.800
it was just us trying to win a game.

48:57.880 --> 49:01.600
<i>I couldn't change that mind-set.</i>
<i>This is what we do.</i>

49:01.680 --> 49:04.880
<i>This is how we do it,</i>
<i>and you better join in with us,</i>

49:04.960 --> 49:07.400
<i>not what I was asked to do,</i>
<i>if you see what I mean.</i>

49:07.480 --> 49:09.080
<i>Let's do what works for us.</i>

49:09.160 --> 49:12.400
Because at the end of the day,
we're the guys on the pitch.

49:12.680 --> 49:16.040
Probably because it's on the horizon
and we maybe just got a little bit nervous

49:16.120 --> 49:17.840
and froze up a little bit.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.080
You can't just blame the system,
you know.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.960
It's the players within the system.
Players just don't perform.

49:24.040 --> 49:27.120
<i>And I think you see it in every side,</i>
<i>they have a bad spell.</i>

49:27.200 --> 49:29.320
<i>And unfortunately,</i>
<i>our spell come at a time</i>

49:29.400 --> 49:31.080
<i>when we didn't want it to come.</i>

49:36.720 --> 49:39.120
<i>Taking over a team that was</i>
<i>actually on a really good run,</i>

49:39.200 --> 49:40.520
<i>was really unusual in football.</i>

49:40.600 --> 49:42.160
'Cause obviously
the nature of things is that

49:42.240 --> 49:44.000
new manager comes in
when you've had a bad run.

49:44.080 --> 49:48.200
<i>So for him to come into a club</i>
<i>that played good football for a few games</i>

49:48.280 --> 49:50.640
<i>and won some really good matches</i>
<i>was an odd situation for him.</i>

49:50.720 --> 49:52.760
I remember he had this saying
that he wanted to cut the strings.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.960
He used to always say,
"Cut the strings. Cut the strings."

49:55.040 --> 49:56.920
And we're like, "No, no,
we like the strings, Ollie.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.520
"The strings are decent.
It's getting us success."

49:59.600 --> 50:03.120
<i>And the team was built around</i>
<i>the opposition having the ball,</i>

50:03.200 --> 50:05.000
counterattacking, breaking,

50:05.080 --> 50:08.160
and they were more comfortable
dealing with those situations.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.840
And then with the wide people
we had and the forwards we had,

50:10.920 --> 50:12.760
<i>it was made for that, really.</i>

50:12.840 --> 50:15.720
Of course, they was very different,
Ian from Dougie.

50:15.800 --> 50:18.440
Ollie was so free-flowing and open,

50:18.520 --> 50:20.920
and "Life is great,
and go and enjoy yourselves."

50:21.160 --> 50:24.280
<i>And we were such a self-disciplined team</i>
<i>that had a way of doing it.</i>

50:24.360 --> 50:26.320
And I remember
sometimes he'd get frustrated.

50:26.520 --> 50:29.120
The ghost of Dougie was hanging
over him in that respect.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.080
I know he always kind of referred to it.

50:31.160 --> 50:34.960
How drilled
and how well drilled they were.

50:35.040 --> 50:39.560
But in reality, Palace wouldn't be
where Palace are now

50:39.640 --> 50:41.960
without that drilling that they had.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.800
Without that discipline
that Dougie gave them.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.840
They needed it to feel good enough

50:47.920 --> 50:50.400
whereas I couldn't convince them
that they were better than that.

50:50.720 --> 50:53.400
Managers are managers. They want to put
their own style of things.

50:53.480 --> 50:58.520
And if you see the results after that,
we weren't the team, that winning team,

50:58.600 --> 51:00.720
that we had
in the beginning of the season.

51:00.960 --> 51:05.680
I tried to change it to what I wanted,
in my way of doing it,

51:05.760 --> 51:09.240
<i>but overall what I was asked to do,</i>
<i>I didn't do.</i>

51:12.400 --> 51:16.480
The Barnsley game, fiasco, their shirt
was deemed too similar to ours.

51:16.760 --> 51:19.040
<i>So they played in the Palace kit.</i>

51:21.080 --> 51:24.000
And a lot of things
that were poetic in that season.

51:24.600 --> 51:27.920
<i>The fact that we couldn't</i>
<i>even beat ourselves felt strange.</i>

51:28.000 --> 51:30.040
<i>There was something we known</i>
<i>and we missed it that day almost.</i>

51:30.120 --> 51:32.920
<i>The ridiculousness of that game</i>
<i>that felt apt</i>

51:33.000 --> 51:35.520
<i>couldn't see where we were gonna even</i>
<i>buy a win at that stage.</i>

51:35.600 --> 51:37.960
<i>And you just suddenly thought,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God.</i>

51:38.480 --> 51:40.800
Maybe even play-off's
not a possibility now."

51:46.760 --> 51:50.960
It doesn't take long for depression
to kick in with Palace fans.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.880
<i>You suddenly felt, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>if Glenn's not scoring,</i>

51:53.960 --> 51:55.680
<i>who's gonna bang them in?"</i>

51:56.920 --> 51:59.240
<i>To watch your team</i>
<i>create chance after chance,</i>

51:59.320 --> 52:02.160
and we didn't hit the bar and the post,
everyone was in Row Z.

52:02.240 --> 52:03.920
<i>If we'd have scored a goal,</i>
<i>it would have completely changed</i>

52:04.000 --> 52:05.560
<i>the atmosphere of the whole stadium.</i>

52:05.640 --> 52:08.480
<i>'Cause I felt we played all right,</i>
<i>we just couldn't put the ball in the net.</i>

52:09.600 --> 52:13.240
<i>Something wasn't quite right.</i>
<i>We were nervous coming to games again.</i>

52:13.760 --> 52:16.000
<i>All these people were coming up</i>
<i>with a hundred reasons</i>

52:16.080 --> 52:19.680
why we were just no good anymore
and Holloway had ruined it.

52:19.760 --> 52:24.280
Certainly became a bit more of concern
about where this season's going

52:24.360 --> 52:27.560
you know, after all this excitement
and potential.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.720
I can't even see us
making the play-offs at the moment.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.040
It's such a tough league

52:31.120 --> 52:34.680
and momentum is a huge
driving force behind results.

52:34.760 --> 52:36.840
So you get into a rut
and it's so difficult.

52:36.920 --> 52:38.560
It really looked like
it was slipping away.

52:38.640 --> 52:39.960
We went away to Ipswich.

52:40.040 --> 52:43.840
<i>People were panicking</i>
<i>and advocating sacking the manager.</i>

52:44.240 --> 52:46.320
<i>I just felt this was not a blip.</i>

52:46.400 --> 52:50.400
<i>I felt it was a big</i>
<i>old-fashioned Palace horror show.</i>

52:50.480 --> 52:54.920
<i>Speroni hesitates</i>
<i>and Nouble will make him pay.</i>

52:55.000 --> 52:56.800
<i>Terrible mistake by Speroni.</i>

52:56.880 --> 52:58.200
<i>You can forget about the top two.</i>

52:58.280 --> 53:01.040
Now we gotta concentrate
on just getting those play-offs.

53:01.120 --> 53:04.520
<i>Here's Creswell. Oh, he's volleyed that.</i>
<i>It's gone all the way in.</i>

53:05.400 --> 53:08.360
<i>Palace get us back underway.</i>
<i>And it's Peter Ramage.</i>

53:09.960 --> 53:11.960
<i>Oh, and he's been dispossessed.</i>

53:12.040 --> 53:13.480
<i>And Nouble will score again</i>

53:13.560 --> 53:16.600
<i>from another defensive error</i>
<i>by Crystal Palace.</i>

53:17.320 --> 53:19.080
<i>It's all going wrong.</i>

53:22.680 --> 53:25.000
If we're not careful here,
we're gonna blow it.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.240
I was poor on that night
and I hold my hands open.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.360
You know, I deserve to be dropped
for my performance.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.280
Whilst I was a little bit angry
and obviously annoyed

53:40.360 --> 53:42.960
'cause I knew how good a player Gabbs was.
That was gonna come in.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.720
<i>Me, him and Damo were</i>
<i>three of the best mates off the field.</i>

53:45.800 --> 53:47.240
So it was always gonna be one of us

53:47.360 --> 53:49.320
that was kind of gonna be
somewhat frustrated

53:49.400 --> 53:53.080
and just going into the most crucial time
of the season, it was me.

53:53.160 --> 53:56.360
We lost players to injuries,
lost our form.

53:56.440 --> 53:58.840
As is inevitable
they all seemed to happen at once.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.400
And Mile got suspended
for a couple of games.

54:01.480 --> 54:04.440
It was tiredness. The same players
were getting flogged every week.

54:04.520 --> 54:07.640
Yannick ran out of steam,
Rambo ran out of steam.

54:07.720 --> 54:09.720
I was kind of, I could kind of feel it
in my legs a little bit.

54:10.320 --> 54:13.000
We were holding a meeting
after one of the games and I just said,

54:13.080 --> 54:15.440
"We can't let this...
This has gotta be our time, boys.

54:15.520 --> 54:16.760
Forget any of this else.

54:16.840 --> 54:19.160
We've come too far
for this not to happen."

54:19.240 --> 54:21.520
After that, we just kind of
came together and like,

54:21.600 --> 54:24.080
"We can't throw away
what we've worked so hard for."

54:24.160 --> 54:26.880
We would be disappointed in ourselves,
we would have let ourselves down,

54:26.960 --> 54:28.800
but we would have let everyone else down.

54:28.880 --> 54:32.480
Most importantly, us as a group, we hadn't
worked this hard to get to this point.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.160
You know, obviously we were worried
as you always are that, you know,

54:35.240 --> 54:36.560
"Have we blown our chance?"

54:36.640 --> 54:38.640
You know, the senior players,
we got together

54:38.720 --> 54:40.200
and try and approach the manager

54:40.280 --> 54:42.640
and just say, "Look,
can we change our style a little bit?"

54:42.720 --> 54:46.520
You know, at times Ollie was probably,
"We gotta keep doing what we're doing

54:46.600 --> 54:49.240
'cause it got us to where we are now.
We're just going through a bad patch."

54:49.760 --> 54:54.560
But Ollie believed in the 4-3-3
and he always believed we'd come good.

54:55.600 --> 54:59.320
I found it hard, I found it hard,
really, that's exactly what I found.

54:59.400 --> 55:02.400
Those things that were happening,
I found out since, I didn't know then.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.360
They were undermining me
a little bit, you know,

55:05.440 --> 55:10.800
where Steve would have had meetings
with just three of the senior lads

55:10.880 --> 55:13.440
and talking about what I'm doing
on the training ground.

55:13.520 --> 55:15.040
Really, I wouldn't have wanted him
doing that.

55:15.120 --> 55:18.720
I would have wanted him to talk to me
and then I'd talk to my senior players,

55:18.800 --> 55:21.400
but everybody has their own way, you know.

55:21.760 --> 55:23.120
Steve was very hands-on,

55:23.200 --> 55:25.280
whereas Karl Oyston let me do
whatever I wanted.

55:26.160 --> 55:29.160
<i>So I'd come out</i>
<i>of basically running me own show,</i>

55:29.240 --> 55:31.320
doing whatever I wanted, you know.

55:31.400 --> 55:33.760
But it's funny the emotions that you get,

55:33.840 --> 55:37.400
and obviously being so close to it,
as Steve was,

55:38.120 --> 55:39.960
what it meant to him, I mean,

55:40.040 --> 55:42.880
I'd like a pound for every time
he mentioned Dougie.

55:42.960 --> 55:45.560
In the end, I had to say,
"For Christ's sake, he left you."

55:45.640 --> 55:46.880
For God's sake.

55:46.960 --> 55:48.840
You know what I mean?
"Shut up talking about Dougie."

55:48.920 --> 55:50.200
It was on me.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.200
To be honest, it was mainly Steve.

55:52.280 --> 55:55.800
I helped with the ticketing.
Steve did most of it, really.

55:56.560 --> 55:59.720
Failure would definitely have been on me
if we hadn't been promoted.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.600
The discipline had gone,
the structure had gone.

56:02.680 --> 56:05.880
The way we were playing,
it just wasn't us.

56:06.160 --> 56:07.720
Just wasn't what had got us there.

56:07.800 --> 56:10.120
I spoke to a couple of the senior players

56:10.200 --> 56:11.960
and I just said,
"Look, this is the way I see it.

56:12.040 --> 56:15.680
We're bit too open, too expansive.
We're not really cut out for it.

56:15.760 --> 56:19.080
I'm gonna speak to Ian because
I think it's difficult for you guys.

56:19.160 --> 56:20.800
But I just wanna know
that I'm on firm ground

56:20.880 --> 56:22.240
and, you know, this is what we all think."

56:22.320 --> 56:24.120
And they were pretty much,
"Yes. We really think

56:24.200 --> 56:25.880
we should go back
pretty much to what we were."

56:25.960 --> 56:28.800
I don't think it was
in any way to undermine...

56:29.040 --> 56:32.640
But I just couldn't let that moment pass.
I thought this is a lifetime opportunity.

56:32.720 --> 56:36.120
It would just be neglectful for me
to not do anything in this moment.

56:36.200 --> 56:38.840
I said to Ian, "We were top of the league

56:38.920 --> 56:41.720
and now it looks like
we won't make the play-offs.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.480
I mean, that's gonna be
difficult for me, Ian.

56:44.560 --> 56:47.000
I don't know what
the consequences of that are,

56:47.080 --> 56:50.560
but it will be a big blow
for this football club

56:50.880 --> 56:53.080
if we don't at least make the play-offs."

56:55.800 --> 56:58.360
<i>Once you're in there, that's it,</i>
<i>it's a whole different ballgame.</i>

56:58.960 --> 57:01.240
<i>Once you're in there, everything changes.</i>

57:01.320 --> 57:02.800
<i>The excitement, everything.</i>

57:02.880 --> 57:04.440
And it is unbelievable.

57:05.360 --> 57:06.760
You gotta be brave.

57:07.400 --> 57:10.200
You gotta tweak the nose of fear.

57:10.640 --> 57:14.280
You gotta put ice cube
down the vest of terror.

57:14.400 --> 57:16.800
and you gotta go through it,
that's what it's about.

57:17.280 --> 57:20.560
But when you do it,
oh, my God, you'll never ever forget.

57:20.640 --> 57:23.160
So I've done it once, I want another go.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.280
I didn't do it last year.
I want another go.

57:25.360 --> 57:28.680
So that's what I'm talking about.
If that ain't good enough for someone...

57:28.760 --> 57:31.000
God, what can I do?

57:46.400 --> 57:50.160
<i>Oh, my word!</i>
<i>It's one of the goals of the season!</i>

57:50.240 --> 57:52.520
<i>High drama at Selhurst Park.</i>

57:56.480 --> 57:58.960
<i>These two great rivals</i>
<i>could not be split.</i>

57:59.720 --> 58:02.320
<i>In the biggest match,</i>
<i>on the biggest stage.</i>
