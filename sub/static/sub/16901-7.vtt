WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:06.669
Liz, Lutz and I are going
to walk around Times Square

00:06.806 --> 00:07.864
and pretend to be foreign.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.067
<i>I am from Hamburg, ja!</i>

00:10.210 --> 00:11.074
Want to come?

00:11.211 --> 00:13.441
Oh, I can't.
My cousin is in town.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.239
All right.

00:14.381 --> 00:16.110
See you, though.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.274
Liz, I'm getting drinks with the
recently divorced camera guy.

00:18.418 --> 00:19.442
You in?

00:19.586 --> 00:22.214
Legally separated sound guy's
gonna be there.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.414
Oh. I don't feel well.

00:24.557 --> 00:25.956
Oh. Okay.

00:26.993 --> 00:30.724
Hey, Liz Lemon, I'm going to
an animals-only strip club.

00:30.864 --> 00:31.728
Interested?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.264
Does that mean
the animals strip

00:33.400 --> 00:34.765
or the animals
are the customers?

00:34.901 --> 00:37.301
Animal customers?
That's ridiculous.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.371
Well, I have got a date.

00:39.506 --> 00:42.202
So, I...
Yeah.

00:48.081 --> 00:49.139
Order, please.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.715
Hi. Order for pickup.

00:50.850 --> 00:54.183
Yes, I would like a meatball sub
with extra bread.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.309
And my name is...

00:55.455 --> 00:56.319
Liz?

00:56.456 --> 00:57.821
Yeah, that's me.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.515
Okay.

00:59.659 --> 01:01.684
Big night, Lemon?
Let me guess.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.523
Meatball sub, extra bread,

01:03.663 --> 01:05.028
bottle of NyQuil,

01:05.165 --> 01:06.826
TiVo "Top Chef,"

01:06.966 --> 01:08.900
a little Miss Bonnie Raitt,
lights out.

01:09.035 --> 01:10.559
No. I have something to do
tonight.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.000
Then you won't mind
when I tell you

01:12.138 --> 01:14.504
that Casey
gets voted off tonight.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.667
You monster!
Why are you like this?

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.432 --> 01:42.333
Sir, Tracy's here
with a bunch of kids.

01:42.469 --> 01:43.834
He wants to know if you have
a minute to meet with them.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.096
Absolutely not.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.432
J. D.!

01:46.573 --> 01:47.403
There he is!

01:47.540 --> 01:49.940
I want you to meet
the baseball team I'm coaching.

01:50.076 --> 01:53.705
A group of fine young men
and one special lady.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.644
Dijonaise is a boy's name?
Pardon me.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.944
Tracy, this is wonderful.

01:59.085 --> 02:00.780
I had no idea you were
interested in baseball.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.115
I wasn't. My motorcycle
hit a police horse.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.416
This is community service.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.422
These kids come
from Knuckle Beach,

02:06.559 --> 02:08.151
the worst neighborhood
in New York.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.762
They are poor as hell.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.762
Baseball is a wonderful sport,
boys.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.059
I remember
when my high-school team

02:14.200 --> 02:15.633
won the Boston
City Championship.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.360
Everyone told us
we were going to lose

02:17.504 --> 02:18.869
because our team
was all white

02:19.005 --> 02:20.996
and the other team
was completely...

02:21.141 --> 02:22.836
Uh...

02:22.976 --> 02:24.671
Anyway, we won,

02:24.811 --> 02:26.472
and I learned
that anything is possible.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.605
Baseball taught me how to win.
Baseball taught me how to dream.

02:29.749 --> 02:30.875
What are your dreams?

02:31.017 --> 02:33.508
When I grow up, I'm going to do
vending-machine maintenance.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.213
I'm going to get shot by a cop
and sue the city.

02:36.356 --> 02:39.348
I'm going to be a talkative
doorman with a drinking problem.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.323
That's right.
You shoot for the stars.

02:41.461 --> 02:44.396
No, no, no, no, no. These are
not the dreams of winners.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.329
These aren't winners.
They're 0-17.

02:47.467 --> 02:50.061
Damn! We supposed to be
at the game right now.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.727
0-18!

02:51.871 --> 02:53.304
That one's on Coach Tracy.

02:53.439 --> 02:56.840
Someday I'll have an office
like this. To clean.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.444
You could have an office
like this of your very own.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.240
All you need is someone to point
you in the right direction,

03:01.381 --> 03:02.245
a role model.

03:02.382 --> 03:03.781
Like R. Kelly
and Michael Vick.

03:05.318 --> 03:07.752
Faze?

03:07.887 --> 03:09.354
Thanks.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.354
Uh, Grandy?

03:11.491 --> 03:13.459
Oh, my God.
Who ordered the veal?

03:13.593 --> 03:14.890
Am I right, guys?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.223
Ugh, Jenna,
that guy is a baby.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.489
Lutz?
I'm Lutz.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.361
You ordered a venti
chocolate mocha blast

03:21.501 --> 03:23.935
with half-and-half
and brownie chunks?

03:24.070 --> 03:25.594
Thank you...
Jamie.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.262
I like your blond streaks.

03:27.407 --> 03:28.840
It's very Simon Le Bon.

03:28.975 --> 03:29.703
Who?

03:29.842 --> 03:31.036
Oh, you're young.

03:31.177 --> 03:34.010
Give it up, Jenna.
You're talking to an ultrasound.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.115
Now I'm getting attitude from
the sexy librarian over here.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.615
What? Sexy?
You are. Shut up.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.053
That guy is adorable.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.215
Hah, Frank's gay!

03:46.359 --> 03:48.919
Maybe I am gay.
For that little peach.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.121
Yeah, you want to kiss him?

03:51.264 --> 03:52.128
I do.

03:52.265 --> 03:55.860
I want to kiss him on the mouth
and hold him.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.526
What are you talking about?

03:57.670 --> 03:59.035
Something just happened,
Liz.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.299
Come on.
You read "Boobs" magazine.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.068
I want Jamie.

04:03.209 --> 04:04.471
Yeah, you're gay!

04:05.712 --> 04:07.907
He's totally gay for...

04:09.349 --> 04:11.442
Why isn't this any fun?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.074
Come on, gather 'round.
Circle up.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.447
Everybody circle up.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.748
All right, circle up.
Circle up.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.653
Come around me.
Around me.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.053
All right, listen.
That's enough.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.786
There's a weird dude
standing over there,

04:22.929 --> 04:24.123
and I don't want to get shot
today.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.697
Great hustle, great practice.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.494
Okay, the weird dude is gone.
Go home.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.407
Hey, you guys,
it's that king we met!

04:39.545 --> 04:40.842
Good afternoon, boys.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.106
I've been thinking a lot
about you,

04:42.248 --> 04:43.408
and I decided
that I want to help.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.176
Starting with some new uniforms.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.185
Compliments of
the Sheinhardt Wig Company.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.686
You want to be
a bunch of winners?

04:49.822 --> 04:51.153
You've got to dress for success.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.054
That's why I sponsor a charity

04:53.192 --> 04:55.217
that gives away tuxedoes
to homeless people.

04:55.361 --> 04:58.023
It was a beautiful ceremony.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.291
Mazel tov.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.333
That's right.
Put them on.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.959
You don't get these kids, Jack.
They don't care about winning.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.004
They just want to be able
to go outside for once.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.667
At our first practice,
they asked me what the sun was.

05:13.746 --> 05:14.644
Hey.

05:14.781 --> 05:15.645
Hey.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.875
Hey, Jamie. Hey.

05:18.017 --> 05:21.646
Did you just come from working
out, or are you naturally veiny?

05:21.788 --> 05:23.221
Pull it together, Frank.

05:23.356 --> 05:24.789
All right. Okay.

05:24.924 --> 05:27.154
Good to see you, man.

05:27.293 --> 05:28.021
Thanks.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.560
So, I don't want to interrupt
or anything,

05:31.698 --> 05:34.326
but are you doing anything
Saturday night?

05:34.467 --> 05:36.492
Just gellin' like Magellan.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.901
Okay, well, my friend's DJing
at this gallery opening.

05:40.039 --> 05:42.405
He can get us in
if you want to go.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.407
Oh, no, I don't think so.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.068
Come on. It'll be fun.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.180
Jamie, how old do you think
I am?

05:48.314 --> 05:49.906
I don't know. 29?

05:50.049 --> 05:54.145
Wow.
You are good at guessing ages.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.415
I am exactly 29.

05:57.557 --> 05:58.489
But you're a baby.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.387
No, I'm not. I'm 25.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.493
Really?
Yeah.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.185
I thought you were younger.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.854
And I'm 29, so...

06:05.998 --> 06:07.056
So you'll go?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.023
Awesome.

06:09.168 --> 06:12.604
Dude, I totally forgot.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.934
I bought you a sweater.
It's slim-fitting.

06:15.074 --> 06:16.564
They call it a French cut.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.074
It wasn't on sale
or anything.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.109
Wow. Thanks.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.269
Do you need help
trying it on?

06:20.413 --> 06:21.038
No.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.374
So, I'll pick you up
around 10:00?

06:22.515 --> 06:25.040
At night?
Okay, that sounds great.

06:25.184 --> 06:26.378
Great.
Where are we going?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.046
Frank, stop it.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.920
I can't.
I'm gay for Jamie.

06:34.060 --> 06:34.924
No, that's not a thing.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.892
You can't be gay
for just one person

06:37.029 --> 06:39.259
unless you're a lady
and you meet Ellen.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.529
Well, then, I got some
real thinking to do.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.933
It's scary.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.336
But also exciting.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.406
I can't believe I did that.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.777
I told myself
I would never lie about my age.

06:56.916 --> 06:57.905
These things happen, Liz.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.109
I had my "no sex with Asians"
rule.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.483
But then one day you walk into
Sharper Image, and there's Quan.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.715
Forget it.
I'm gonna order more coffee

07:04.857 --> 07:06.722
and then he'll come back
and I can cancel.

07:06.859 --> 07:08.622
No.
This is a good thing.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.956
A hot guy
thinks you're 29.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.530
He is cute.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.428
He looks like Zac Efron.

07:14.567 --> 07:15.591
That's a thing, right?

07:15.735 --> 07:17.202
Oh, go for it, Liz.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.998
I always roll with it
when hot guys think I'm 22.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.004
What can we do?
We're cougars.

07:22.141 --> 07:22.835
We're what?

07:22.975 --> 07:23.634
Cougars.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.802
Hot older ladies pouncing
on their young prey.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.413
Ugh.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.381
There was a whole article
about it in "Vanity Fair. "

07:31.517 --> 07:32.950
The one with
the "Crisis in Africa" cover.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.144
God, it makes me so sad

07:35.288 --> 07:36.949
that more people don't know
about cougars.

07:37.089 --> 07:39.250
Why am I looking for something
to wear in wardrobe?

07:39.392 --> 07:41.587
Why don't you go
to Abercrombie & Fitch?

07:41.727 --> 07:43.092
No,
it's too loud in there.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.823
Don't say that.
Cougars have to act young.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.126
You should get
a Ring Pop to suck on.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.459
What are you doing?

07:51.604 --> 07:53.697
Figuring some stuff out.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.364
Sorry, Jenna.
I'm probably gay now.

07:55.508 --> 07:59.069
It's never gonna happen
between us.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.374
You wanted to see me?

08:03.516 --> 08:04.380
Hello, Coach.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.849
I thought we'd have a little
meeting before today's practice.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.181
Practice? Meetings?
What is this, a marriage?

08:09.322 --> 08:12.485
Phil Jackson likes to give books
to his players to inspire them.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.593
So, which biography
of Winston Churchill

08:14.727 --> 08:16.126
do you think would improve
Rashid's bunting?

08:16.262 --> 08:19.231
Jack, have you ever been
to Knuckle Beach?

08:19.365 --> 08:21.230
It's a totally different world.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.595
A world where orange soda

08:22.735 --> 08:24.794
is an acceptable substitute
for breast milk!

08:24.937 --> 08:27.098
Tracy, I don't have to
understand their world

08:27.240 --> 08:28.207
in order to help them.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.706
It's like this great country
of ours.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.469
We can go into any nation,

08:31.611 --> 08:33.203
impose our values,
and make things better.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.904
It's what Bush is doing
all over the globe.

08:35.047 --> 08:38.015
Bush? Now, I don't want to go
off on a rant here.

08:42.488 --> 08:44.422
So, I suppose the next step

08:44.557 --> 08:47.082
would be to bring
our superior resources to bear.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.717
Kenneth, show him the drawing
of the new field.

08:52.398 --> 08:55.629
Oh, sorry.
This is my dream journal.

08:56.969 --> 08:59.199
They've all come true so far.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.756
What the heck
is going on out here?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.094
You didn't get
behind grounders.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.793
You didn't work
the pitch count.

09:30.937 --> 09:33.201
There was nothing Churchillian
about that performance.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.500
And where are their uniforms?

09:35.641 --> 09:36.938
You can't wear blue
in Knuckle Beach,

09:37.076 --> 09:39.237
which is hard because
jeans go with everything.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.744
Tracy, your failure of
leadership is unacceptable.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.143
Now you're going to blame this
on me?

09:43.282 --> 09:44.749
I told you
this was going to happen.

09:44.884 --> 09:45.873
Exactly.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.612
I need somebody who believes
in what we're doing here.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.779
Tracy, you're fired.
Kenneth, you're in charge.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.818
So, you like the music?

09:55.962 --> 09:59.398
Yeah. Speaking of music I like,
how about Gnarls Barkley, huh?

09:59.532 --> 10:00.396
That guy's great.

10:00.533 --> 10:04.060
Have you been
to his official website?

10:04.203 --> 10:05.465
Is it only 1:00 a. M?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.469
Yeah.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.335
So, after this,
I figured we'd hit up Marquee.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.465
They only serve drinks
till 4:00,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.305
but I can get us into
this great club in Brooklyn.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.275
I'm 37!

10:13.412 --> 10:14.174
What?

10:14.313 --> 10:16.372
I'm 37. Please don't make me
go to Brooklyn.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.348
I'm 20.

10:18.484 --> 10:21.248
Oh, boy.

10:21.387 --> 10:24.185
This just went from
a senior dating a freshman

10:24.323 --> 10:26.985
to Mary Kay Letourneau
and Vili Fualaau.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.388
Are those friends of yours?

10:29.795 --> 10:33.390
Oh, when will death come?

10:35.034 --> 10:36.262
Lemon, what happened?

10:36.402 --> 10:38.927
Did you take an Ambien with your
Franzia and sleepwalk here?

10:39.071 --> 10:41.266
No. I am out on a date.

10:41.407 --> 10:44.342
I know you.
You deliver my coffee.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.501
You're here with Lemon?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.840
Yes, sir.
I'm Jamie, Mr. Donaghy.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.845
What a polite young man.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.074
They just changed bartenders.

10:51.217 --> 10:54.050
I'm going to go see
if this guy will serve me.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.949
Where did you two meet?
An Amber Alert?

10:56.088 --> 10:59.057
I just found out that he's
17 years younger than me.

10:59.191 --> 11:00.590
I knew I shouldn't have
done this.

11:00.726 --> 11:01.852
I look ridiculous.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.222
Nonsense.
You've never looked better.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.489
Do I look ridiculous when you
see me with a younger woman?

11:05.631 --> 11:08.862
Boy, the art in here
is hung really level.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.526
A youthful companion is
the ultimate status accessory.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.229
Well, maybe you can
pull that off.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.839
You're a man.
It's different for women.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.771
That is so sexist of you.

11:16.909 --> 11:18.501
To that clueless boy
over there,

11:18.644 --> 11:19.975
you're a very powerful woman.

11:20.112 --> 11:21.204
Technically, you're a catch.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.678
You've got money,
status,

11:22.815 --> 11:24.510
naturally thick hair,
a decent set.

11:24.650 --> 11:25.844
All right.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.179
Have you been on a date
since Floyd?

11:27.319 --> 11:28.047
No.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.382
Why are you so against
having fun in your life?

11:30.523 --> 11:31.615
I'm not against fun.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.486
I went up on my roof
the other day.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.684
Stop fighting this.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.590
He's hot, poor,
and eager to please.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.959
Just buy him a few gifts, never
give him your home phone number,

11:39.098 --> 11:40.725
and if you set a curfew,
stick to it.

11:41.467 --> 11:42.491
Oh, gosh.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.768
Hey, Coach.
How did practice go today?

11:48.908 --> 11:51.342
Sir, conditions
have deteriorated.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.536
I made Demarquis captain
like you said.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.112
But having a kid from Trinidad
in charge

11:55.247 --> 11:56.578
made the Latinos real mad.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.616
And they all seem to really hate
my grandpa

11:58.751 --> 12:00.241
'cause they keep yelling,
"Kill Whitey. "

12:00.386 --> 12:03.014
And I'm like, "What do you
think you are, alcohol?"

12:03.155 --> 12:05.885
There was bound to be some
unrest once we removed Tracy.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.549
They're testing our resolve.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.126
Stay the course.

12:17.870 --> 12:18.996
Kenneth!

12:19.138 --> 12:20.867
Mr. Jordan,
about what happened...

12:21.006 --> 12:22.234
I don't want to talk about it,
Ken.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.467
You'll hear all I have to say
about Jack Donaghy

12:24.610 --> 12:25.770
in my tell-all book,

12:25.911 --> 12:27.503
"Betrayal"... colon...

12:27.646 --> 12:30.274
"What Really Happened With
My Baseball Team"... comma...

12:30.416 --> 12:32.543
"Disaster
at Knuckle Beach"...

12:32.685 --> 12:35.745
question mark.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.155
What the hell is going on?

12:42.294 --> 12:44.785
It's chaos, sir.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.158
They've turned
on each other.

12:46.298 --> 12:47.162
And they won't listen,

12:47.299 --> 12:49.995
especially when I say, "Don't
hit me with my own shoes. "

12:50.136 --> 12:52.297
I think things may have been
better under Mr. Jordan.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.632
We're not going to
look back now, Kenneth.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.606
Tracy didn't understand what
needed to be done. He had to go.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.575
They're destroying all
the things I bought for them.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.703
Everything but the bats,
sir.

13:01.847 --> 13:04.645
Oh, God, they see us.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.116
You kids put those bats down!

13:07.253 --> 13:09.619
For the love of God.

13:10.656 --> 13:14.592
Liz, did I see you Saturday
at Marquee?

13:14.727 --> 13:16.160
I was there, yes.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.990
So, what were you doing
there?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.097
Is it like that time

13:19.231 --> 13:20.994
they found my grandpa
at the bus station?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.601
No. I was there with Jamie,
the coffee guy,

13:23.736 --> 13:25.203
and we had a great time.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.804
Wow. Coffee guy?

13:26.939 --> 13:29.499
That'll really make
your ex-husband jealous.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.110
Cerie, for the last time,
I have never been married.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.041
That's the spirit!

13:34.180 --> 13:36.273
Hey, Liz, this is Aidan.

13:36.415 --> 13:37.006
Hi.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.446
Guess you're not
the only cougar in town.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.347
Aidan's a freshman at NYU.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.453
Aren't you, Aidan?

13:41.587 --> 13:42.281
Sure.

13:42.421 --> 13:43.285
Give me change for a soda?

13:43.422 --> 13:44.286
You just had one.

13:44.423 --> 13:45.720
Whatever.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.553
No, don't you "whatever" me.

13:47.693 --> 13:51.288
Hey! What did I say about you
wearing your Heelys inside?

13:51.430 --> 13:53.193
Aidan! Wait up.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.321
Aidan!

13:57.703 --> 13:59.830
There she is!
The cradle robber.

13:59.972 --> 14:00.836
Yeah, that's right.

14:00.973 --> 14:04.534
I have a boy toy,
and we look awesome together.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.237
That's great, Maude.
How's Harold?

14:07.379 --> 14:09.438
His name is Jamie,
and you know what?

14:09.582 --> 14:13.074
I don't spend a lot of time
worrying about his feelings.

14:13.219 --> 14:16.518
I just know he's supercute,
and he laughs at all my jokes.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.680
Coffee's here.

14:18.824 --> 14:19.688
Hey, there.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.349
Hey.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.757
I had fun the other night.
Your roof is awesome.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.194
Oh, thanks.
I go up there all the time.

14:26.332 --> 14:28.732
So, you want to get
some lunch?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.358
Oh, I can't.
I have a lot of work to do.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.367
Oh, okay.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.335
'Cause I already got Randy
to cover my shift.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.100
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:36.242 --> 14:39.075
But I bought you
a video game.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.872
"BioShock"! No way!

14:41.013 --> 14:44.244
Hey, chatterbox. Wow.
I thought I heard your voice.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.680
How was your weekend?

14:45.818 --> 14:47.217
It was great.
Liz and I...

14:47.353 --> 14:49.548
I made you a painting.
It's called

14:49.688 --> 14:51.952
"One-Armed Mermaid That's
Part Unicorn With Bigfoot. "

14:52.091 --> 14:54.025
Wow. Thank you.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.286
Are we still on
for tomorrow night?

14:56.428 --> 14:58.794
No, he can't. We're working
out. Yeah, I can't wait.

15:00.699 --> 15:01.825
I'll see you
tomorrow night.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.094
Yeah, I'll take it.
Thank you.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.471
Liz, be good to him.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.309
What do you want, Jack?

15:18.450 --> 15:20.418
Tracy,
I want to talk to you.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.782
It's hard for me to admit
when I've made a mistake.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.287
So I won't.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.085
Mr. Jordan, I have made
a terrible mistake.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.922
Because of my arrogance,
the team is now in chaos.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.154
Pedro and Fontanelle quit

15:31.297 --> 15:32.764
because I tried to put them
in the outfield.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.297
Of course they did!

15:34.433 --> 15:37.231
They're afraid to go
north of 245th Street.

15:37.369 --> 15:38.597
Next, you'll be telling me

15:38.737 --> 15:41.001
you let ReShon have contact
with his birth mother.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.437
Which ReShon?

15:42.574 --> 15:45.099
Jack, I told you, you did not
know what you were getting into.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.041
Tracy,
I only wanted to help.

15:47.179 --> 15:48.942
But now things
are out of control.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.514
We have two options.

15:50.649 --> 15:52.674
One, we can cut and run

15:52.818 --> 15:55.013
and betray the people
that we made this commitment to.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.748
Or you and I can form
a coalition.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.118
No way, J. D.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.192
Tracy, I thought you cared
about these kids.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.386
Just because I don't support
Jack Donaghy

16:03.529 --> 16:05.520
doesn't mean I don't support
the kids.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.529
But, sir, every one of them
wrote you a letter

16:07.666 --> 16:09.099
asking you to come back.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.395
Wow.

16:11.537 --> 16:14.472
Jack, if I come
back to the team,

16:14.606 --> 16:16.904
can I throw these things away
and not have to read them?

16:17.042 --> 16:19.476
Tracy, I'll pay somebody
to read them for you.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.545
With your know-how
and my resources,

16:21.680 --> 16:23.671
we can turn these kids
into winners.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.512
All right, Jack.
What's the plan?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.176
One word.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.514
Surge.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.088
That's two words!

16:36.695 --> 16:37.753
Jamie!

16:37.896 --> 16:39.193
Look, Jamie,

16:39.331 --> 16:42.266
I can't take this
Sam-and-Diane thing anymore.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.835
I need to know
what we're doing here.

16:44.970 --> 16:46.801
Nothing, Frank.
I'm not gay.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.533
I'm not gay, either.
That's why it's perfect.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.336
We're just
two straight guys

16:51.477 --> 16:53.138
who want to enjoy
each other's bodies.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.769
I got to go.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.851
I can't believe
we're winning.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.459
I knew the surge would work.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.025
Way to go, Manuel!

17:18.170 --> 17:20.001
That one goes out
to W. S. Churchill.

17:20.138 --> 17:25.076
Hey, there's no way that those
batters were born after 1993.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.405
These Dominican birth
certificates say otherwise.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.080
Esteban!
You're up.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.276
This is just embarrassing.

17:36.455 --> 17:37.319
Hey.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.423
Hi.

17:39.658 --> 17:40.920
You look nice.

17:41.060 --> 17:41.992
Thank you.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.095
I got you that leather bracelet
that you were looking at.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.094
Oh, that's so ill.
Thank you.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.493
It is ill.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.193
All right, we should get going
'cause we're going to be late.

17:50.335 --> 17:52.303
No, we won't, baby.
We're taking a cab.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.598
Really?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.707
I've never been in a cab
with less than seven people.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.399
Well, stick with me.

17:57.543 --> 17:58.669
I will.

18:00.479 --> 18:01.707
Look at us.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.747
We look awesome together.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.874
Yeah. Now I know
why Demi Moore does this.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.884
I get that reference.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.046
All right, Mom.
I'm taking off!

18:11.190 --> 18:12.418
Mom?

18:12.558 --> 18:15.459
Yeah, I'm 20.
I can't afford this place.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.925
All right, honey.
Have a good time.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.587
Oh, hi. I'm Beth.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.358
Yep,
that's what we look like.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.995
Shut it down.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.309
Oh, hey, Jamie.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.610
Hey.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.788
Oof.
That is so awkward now.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.480
Don't worry about it.
You had your fun.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.886
But the end
was humiliating.

18:47.025 --> 18:50.256
All May-December relationships
end in humiliation.

18:50.395 --> 18:53.193
Sexual incompatibility, social
faux pas, meeting their parents.

18:53.332 --> 18:54.230
It's classic.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.458
I'm not sure it's worth it.

18:55.601 --> 18:56.966
Don't be silly.
Jamie was good for you.

18:57.102 --> 18:59.229
A younger companion
makes you feel more alive.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.838
Opens you up
to new experiences,

19:00.973 --> 19:03.874
fresh points of view,
stimulating conversation.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.499
Stop repeating what I say.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.111
Stop repeating what I say.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.213
This is over.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.314
This is over.

19:09.448 --> 19:12.042
Of course, there are exceptions.
Thank God I'm off the market.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.811
Oh.
Are you seeing someone?

19:13.952 --> 19:16.614
What? No. I mean this company
is my girlfriend.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.518
She gives me all the loving
I'll ever want or need.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.352
That's gross, Jack.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.155
Stop hitting yourself,
Jenna.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.263
Why are you like this?

19:33.939 --> 19:36.840
Guys, this isn't working.

19:36.975 --> 19:40.467
I'm not gay-gay.
I'm just gay for Jamie.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.944
Frank, I don't think
that's a thing.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.139
It is.

19:44.283 --> 19:47.844
Look, you dudes are great,
a lot of fun to dance with,

19:47.986 --> 19:49.283
and you smell awesome.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.788
Enjoy your night.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.950
Bye, sexy bear!

19:55.093 --> 19:58.494
Terence, you make us all
look so bad.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.831
<i>My muffin top is all that?</i>

20:02.968 --> 20:04.833
<i>Whole grain, low fat?</i>

20:04.970 --> 20:06.801
<i>I know you want
a piece of that?</i>

20:06.939 --> 20:07.837
<i>But I just want to dance?</i>

20:07.973 --> 20:09.838
<i>Checking out my sweet hips?</i>

20:09.975 --> 20:11.840
<i>My sugar-coated berry lips?</i>

20:11.977 --> 20:13.842
<i>I know you want
to get with this?</i>

20:13.979 --> 20:15.503
<i>But I'm just here to dance?</i>

20:15.647 --> 20:18.844
<i>So back up off of me?</i>

20:18.984 --> 20:23.011
<i>You're weirding me out?</i>

20:23.155 --> 20:24.679
<i>I'm an independent lady?</i>

20:24.823 --> 20:26.347
<i>So do not try to play me?</i>

20:26.491 --> 20:28.721
<i>I run a tidy bakery?</i>

20:28.860 --> 20:30.191
<i>The boys all want
my cake for free?</i>

20:30.329 --> 20:32.263
<i>But if you can't shake
your fakery?</i>

20:32.397 --> 20:34.888
<i>Then kiss my muffin top?</i>

20:35.305 --> 20:41.232
