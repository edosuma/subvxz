WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.737
HAKEEM: Previously on Empire...
LUCIOUS:
I'm-a sign your baby girl,

00:03.771 --> 00:05.239
and then I'm-a slip her
my bone.

00:05.273 --> 00:06.907
Kill him.

00:06.940 --> 00:07.808
(Gathers screams)

00:07.841 --> 00:09.810
Me, Andre and Hakeem--

00:09.843 --> 00:11.011
we're starting
our own company.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.413
It's called Lyon Dynasty.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.881
Hakeem wants his album heard,

00:13.914 --> 00:15.383
he's gonna have to come back
to the Empire.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.351
Lucious is trying
to make you like him.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.986
HAKEEM: My album--
I leaked it online tonight.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.588
We'll sue the drawers
off your black ass.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.490
You need to get out!
Good luck.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.392
An all-Latina girl group,
that could be huge, man.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.827
I'm not interested
in being a part of a group.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.329
HAKEEM:
She crazy. I love her.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.164
My heart is not
in this, Mom.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.932
Empire's in my blood.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.434
I'm praying that
you'll forgive me.
I don't.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.435
My name is Thurston Rawlings.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.704
Miss Roxanne Ford plays dirty,

00:36.737 --> 00:38.872
but I got no qualms
getting in the mud with her.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.974
Bail is granted at $1 million.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.913
This is a temporary setback
and nothing more.

00:45.946 --> 00:49.917
Lucious Lyon is an arrogant,
manipulative sociopath

00:49.950 --> 00:51.919
who believes he's above the law.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.955
But I assure you,
he will be tried and convicted.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.190
Ms. Ford, does the
state actually have

00:56.224 --> 00:57.858
any concrete evidence?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.193
There's a rumor you're
about to announce

00:59.227 --> 01:00.461
your bid for Attorney General...

01:00.494 --> 01:01.795
(reporters clamoring)
REPORTER: Lucious! Lucious!

01:01.829 --> 01:02.930
Lucious! Lucious,
right here.
Lucious!

01:02.963 --> 01:04.031
Did you know
that Roxanne Ford

01:04.064 --> 01:05.233
is running for
Attorney General?

01:05.266 --> 01:06.300
Are you concerned
that she's trying

01:06.334 --> 01:07.301
to build a campaign
on convicting you?

01:07.335 --> 01:08.936
No, I'm absolutely flattered.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.639
Um, let me know where
I can make a donation, Ms. Ford.

01:11.672 --> 01:12.973
THIRSTY: No, we'll make
our case in court,

01:13.006 --> 01:14.041
where my client's innocence
will be

01:14.074 --> 01:15.709
proven beyond
a shadow of a doubt.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.778
Now, for the sake of
America's musical entertainment,

01:17.811 --> 01:19.447
Lucious Lyon has to get
back to work.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.881
Ms. Ford made it
a condition of your bail

01:20.914 --> 01:22.116
that you're not allowed
back into Empire.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.417
Will that be
a problem for you?

01:23.451 --> 01:24.818
Well, that's just
a building.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.454
I am the Empire.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.789
(knocking continues)

01:28.822 --> 01:31.625
Hakeem! Get your ass up.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.861
You know you gotta be
on Sway in the morn...

01:35.663 --> 01:36.930
(exhales)

01:36.964 --> 01:39.167
Oh, great. Just great.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.470
You know, the night
before Jamal had to do Sway,

01:42.503 --> 01:44.338
he was in bed by 10:00 p.m.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.773
You know why?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.675
Because that is called
professionalism.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.909
Well, I'm not Jamal.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.244
Hakeem, where my chonies?

01:50.278 --> 01:52.480
Obviously not.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.916
(sighs)
Uh, Hakeem...

01:55.949 --> 01:57.851
hooking up with
the lead singer

01:57.885 --> 01:59.653
in your all-female group?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.789
That is a Unsung episode
waiting to happen,

02:01.822 --> 02:04.158
stupid.
I'm not his lead singer.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.793
I'm my own person, thank you.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.127
I'm not talking to you,
Guadalupe.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.662
You need to find
your drawers.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.097
HAKEEM: I think I seen
'em under the bed.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.833
Anyway, Ma, how do I look?
I'm ready.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.035
You look good, but your album
is out on the street

02:15.068 --> 02:16.637
and your damn father's
out of prison.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.805
Dad is out of jail?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.440
I guess you missed that
while you was

02:19.473 --> 02:20.808
up in here, livin' la vida loca.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.042
Nobody scared of Lucious,

02:22.075 --> 02:23.711
not when we got
this hot-ass album to promote.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.179
Trust me, Ma,

02:25.213 --> 02:27.114
between my album
and Mirage á Trois,

02:27.147 --> 02:29.049
we gonna put Lyon Dynasty
on the map.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.884
I hope so.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.986
You shouldn't have
slept with that girl.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.988
Come on here!
Don't forget.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.890
Valentina Galindo.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.228
I'm only a few hundred away
from 50,000 followers.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.929
I'm-a give you
a shout-out, baby.
COOKIE: Hakeem!

02:43.197 --> 02:44.498
LUCIOUS:
No, her making it impossible

02:44.532 --> 02:45.733
for me to enter my house

02:45.766 --> 02:47.535
is more than her trying
to piss me off.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.002
She's up to something.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.471
THIRSTY: Yeah, well,
it's my understanding

02:50.504 --> 02:52.406
Lady Ford claims she might
have to subpoena employees.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.875
She don't want you exerting
any undue influence.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.811
And that freaky judge made it an
additional condition of bail.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.348
So wait a minute.
I go in here, I go to jail.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.350
You walk in there, you
get locked up. Period.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.917
Dad, look.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.153
You can't stop a king
from speaking to his subjects.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.389
Blasphemy. I'm a god.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.458
(crowd cheering)

03:22.102 --> 03:25.873
Today is the beginning of
a new era for the Empire.

03:25.906 --> 03:29.410
A few months ago, we went public
for one very good reason.

03:29.443 --> 03:32.179
That was so that we can
raise enough capital

03:32.212 --> 03:35.015
to take over the music
business worldwide.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.117
Mark this day on your calendar,

03:37.150 --> 03:40.388
because today is the day
that Lucious Lyon told you

03:40.421 --> 03:43.424
that soon the world will not be
able to utter the word "music"

03:43.457 --> 03:46.026
without mentioning the Empire.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.261
To the Empire!

03:47.295 --> 03:49.497
CROWD:
To the Empire!

03:57.571 --> 03:59.373
* 'Bout to blow, 'bout to blow *

03:59.407 --> 04:00.908
* I'm 'bout to blow,
blow, blow *

04:00.941 --> 04:02.710
* I'm 'bout to blow *

04:02.743 --> 04:03.977
* I'm 'bout to blow,
blow, blow *

04:04.011 --> 04:05.879
* Whoa, oh, oh *

04:05.913 --> 04:07.815
* Had my eyes on the throne
since I came to this Earth *

04:07.848 --> 04:09.417
* Yeah *

04:09.450 --> 04:10.818
* Greatness I'm destined for

04:10.851 --> 04:12.219
* More than the universe

04:12.252 --> 04:13.754
* I'm a king, boss

04:13.787 --> 04:15.623
* Rule everything I survey,
know my worth *

04:15.656 --> 04:17.291
* Put in work

04:17.325 --> 04:19.560
* Work, work *
* Twenty-four, seven

04:19.593 --> 04:21.462
* I run the turf
like a running back *

04:21.495 --> 04:23.464
* Hand me the ball
and I ran it back *

04:23.497 --> 04:25.065
* Scored every time
like I'm in the sack *

04:25.098 --> 04:27.335
* I run the team,
call me quarterback *

04:27.368 --> 04:29.670
* I ain't come from the bottom
but still had to grind for it *

04:29.703 --> 04:31.905
* Oh *
* Grind for it, grind for it *

04:31.939 --> 04:34.174
* Pop plotted on me,
but Mama she ride for me *

04:34.207 --> 04:37.678
* Tell 'em, Tim
* Hey! So we 'bout to blow *

04:37.711 --> 04:39.246
* We 'bout to blow,
blow, blow, blow, blow *

04:39.279 --> 04:42.350
* Say we 'bout to blow,
say you 'bout to blow *

04:42.383 --> 04:44.418
* Blow, blow, blow, blow,
blow, blow *

04:44.452 --> 04:46.119
* Blow, blow, blow,
blow, blow, blow *

04:46.153 --> 04:48.956
* We 'bout to blow. *
Yes!

04:48.989 --> 04:50.358
(whoops)

04:50.391 --> 04:52.693
Hakeem Lyon.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.195
Bold move,
the way you busted

04:55.228 --> 04:56.964
out of Empire like that.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.832
What did your pops
have to say about it?

04:58.866 --> 05:01.201
Yo, Sway, you gonna
have to ask him, brah.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.803
THIRSTY:
Yeah, hello?

05:02.836 --> 05:04.271
A'ight, just give
me a sec.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.206
Hey, I got Sway on
the phone for you.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.475
He's on air
right now, so...

05:07.508 --> 05:09.343
LUCIOUS:
No, give me the phone.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.678
Wait, but, Dad...
Yo.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.446
My man Sway, what's up?

05:12.480 --> 05:15.683
I guess you got the exclusive
on my first day out, huh?

05:15.716 --> 05:18.051
It's a consolation prize,
Lucious.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.721
Why you didn't give me
the exclusive on "Snitch Bitch"?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.523
No, no, no, it ain't like that.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.791
He won a bet, baby.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.459
SWAY:
Too bad, my man.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.960
So I'm sitting
with your son,

05:26.994 --> 05:28.396
and we're talking about

05:28.429 --> 05:30.063
how he's following
the same footsteps

05:30.097 --> 05:32.633
as Azealia Banks and Lil Wayne

05:32.666 --> 05:35.302
by leaking his album.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.704
You know, I always said

05:36.737 --> 05:38.238
that boy got a lot
of growing up to do.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.840
I guess I was right, huh?

05:39.873 --> 05:42.009
All right, I'll catch you later.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.544
Whoa, man.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.813
It seem like your daddy
don't sound too happy

05:45.846 --> 05:47.314
about you leaking your album.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.049
You know why he ain't stop me?
Why?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.317
'Cause he was in prison.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.919
SWAY (laughing):
Ooh, damn, bro.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.821
That's cold-blooded.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.223
You know, fact is, I'm about
to run circles around him.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.691
From what I heard,

05:57.725 --> 06:00.594
Lyon Dynasty is just
former Empire artists.

06:00.628 --> 06:03.697
I mean, y'all got V,
you got Tiana, you got you,

06:03.731 --> 06:05.699
but we ain't heard
nothing new yet.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.502
Well, I do got this girl group
I'm producing right now.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.903
Mm-hmm.
Called Mirage á Trois.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.104
Mirage á Trois.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.673
HAKEEM:
Mirage á Trois, Sway.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.341
You know, it's three
girls I handpicked.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.343
They're Latina, they're
sexy, they're cute.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.611
You know, you're
not gonna hear

06:17.645 --> 06:19.079
a sound like this
at Empire, so...

06:19.112 --> 06:20.080
Well, you gonna
bring that exclusive

06:20.113 --> 06:21.348
to Sway in the Morning?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.183
You could bring 'em
up this week.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.184
This week?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.352
This week.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.054
(quietly):
No. No.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.423
No.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.359
Fo' sho' and some mo', Sway.
Ah!

06:32.392 --> 06:34.361
That's what I'm talking about.
My man Hakeem.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.229
Hakeem Lyon, y'all.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.235
You must be relieved,
Jamal, that Lucious is out.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.704
Yeah, I'm excited.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.205
I'm excited to get
back in the studio.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.607
We're talking about a tour.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.975
He set me up
with a really good producer.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.477
COOKIE:
Oh.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.811
So Lucious isn't
working with you.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.446
I just assumed

06:52.480 --> 06:54.582
as soon as he got out of prison,

06:54.615 --> 06:56.484
you'd be his top priority.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.218
I am.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.421
But he just got out, so...
Empire business.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.224
So why'd Dad ask us here, Jamal?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.659
So he can kill
us all together,

07:05.693 --> 07:08.496
instead of having to do it
one at a time?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.798
Same reason why we're all here.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.065
To keep our enemies close.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.834
JAMAL:
I actually think

07:13.867 --> 07:16.870
that he just wants to see his
family on the first night back.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.973
Jamal's actually right.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.742
I want you guys to eat,

07:21.775 --> 07:25.012
drink and be merry,
for tomorrow, we war.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.763
Why aren't you eating?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.698
Did you poison us or something?

07:44.732 --> 07:46.433
Nah, that'd be too easy.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.436
I know I was only gone
for a few months, but it gave me

07:49.469 --> 07:53.040
a whole lot of time to think
about a whole lot of things.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.875
Like my wonderful family

07:54.908 --> 07:56.610
and how y'all all
banded together

07:56.644 --> 07:59.146
to try and destroy me.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.481
Dad, I told you, I'm sorry.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.551
Andre, don't apologize.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.819
I'm not sorry.

08:05.853 --> 08:09.156
Not yet, but you will be.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.390
Unless...

08:10.423 --> 08:11.825
Unless what?

08:11.859 --> 08:16.163
You dismantle this little
Lyon Dynasty you got.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.466
And everything will be forgiven.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.403
From the
leaked album to

08:23.436 --> 08:26.473
the hostile takeover...
to your pillow.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.843
So you're just gonna
forget everything?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.979
You and me, we done
been through a whole lot.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.549
But at the end of the day,
we are family.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.217
And I want my family together,

08:37.250 --> 08:39.887
and if I can have that,
I'll let go of everything else.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.089
COOKIE:
Hmm.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.224
No, Lucious.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.359
I doubt if Jesus Christ
himself could save you

08:46.393 --> 08:51.398
without burning his hands,
but I'm gonna save my sons.

08:51.431 --> 08:52.900
I'm gonna
build something

08:52.933 --> 08:54.702
very nice for them.

08:54.735 --> 08:58.572
So... I really don't care
what you do with Empire.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.074
Three of y'all are here
'cause y'all failed.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.610
Miserably.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.213
My ex-wife, my ex-CFO,

09:06.246 --> 09:09.116
my ex-son who wants
to be a rap star,

09:09.149 --> 09:12.385
working with my ex-wannabe-girl

09:12.419 --> 09:14.354
and with some of
my ex-artists?

09:14.387 --> 09:15.856
Ain't nobody scared
of you though.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.725
We working on
a new project, right?

09:17.758 --> 09:20.594
What, that little girl group
y'all cooking up?

09:20.628 --> 09:23.030
Yep.
You gonna bet
the whole farm on that?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.733
Tell that to Berry Gordy
and the Supremes.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.500
They wish they were me.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.739
I'm giving y'all
one last chance,

09:31.772 --> 09:34.141
because y'all are my family.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.876
I know y'all can't
eat without me,

09:35.909 --> 09:37.477
'cause all y'all got
is pride.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.547
And it's chewy
and it's hard to swallow.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.016
Let it go.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.820
I don't know
what happened to you

09:46.854 --> 09:50.323
when you were locked up,

09:50.357 --> 09:52.926
but you got me twisted, O.G.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.928
I'm always gonna eat.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.297
Just not with you.

10:00.133 --> 10:00.934
Oh, my...

10:13.213 --> 10:15.148
* Miss boss lady *

10:15.182 --> 10:20.187
* Like a boss, boss, boss,
boss, boss, boss, boss *

10:20.220 --> 10:22.589
* Like a boss,
boss, boss, boss *

10:22.622 --> 10:26.359
* Boss lady run it, run it,
boss lady run it, like a boss. *

10:28.729 --> 10:31.198
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.333
I didn't think
you would show up.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.035
I was curious.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.604
What could you possibly
want from me?

10:37.637 --> 10:40.140
Look, if you wanted
a go at my boy,

10:40.173 --> 10:41.374
you should've asked me.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.810
I'd-a let it happen.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.544
I want the best for him.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.615
Hakeem isn't my type,
but you had it coming, Lucious.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.018
Was it worth it?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.222
Called you here
because I need your help

10:55.255 --> 10:56.690
with Lyon Dynasty.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.293
Wow.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.361
(chuckles)

11:01.394 --> 11:02.963
After all you've done to me,

11:02.996 --> 11:05.065
you actually think that
I would betray them for you?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.200
You showed up.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.636
See, I figured if you
showed up, that meant that

11:09.669 --> 11:12.505
things must be pretty damn
bad for you over there.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.310
I know Cookie, and
she doesn't forgive.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.148
So... it must be
a living hell

11:21.181 --> 11:24.651
every single second
you spend there.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.055
Just like every second
I spend here with you?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.323
Lyon Dynasty is gonna fail.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.092
That's just the reality of it.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.661
You and I, we've seen it
a million times.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.563
So, let me... let me guess.

11:36.596 --> 11:40.734
I do something dirty for you,
and you reward me?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.770
You've always been
a little dirty.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.207
Why not get a
reward for it?

11:49.042 --> 11:52.946
Lyon Dynasty
has a chance, Lucious.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.248
Hakeem is coming into
his own over there.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.450
Hakeem is coming
back here.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.386
Brothers, they already
talked about it.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.756
So that's gonna
leave you and Cookie.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.793
And how do you think
that plays out?

12:08.962 --> 12:12.065
You've never
been stupid.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.472
What'd you have in mind?

12:19.506 --> 12:21.875
* Where you at?
Come get it, just do it *

12:21.909 --> 12:24.144
* Do it, do it, do it, do it
* Do it *

12:24.177 --> 12:26.146
* Do it, do it, do it
* Oh, oh *

12:26.179 --> 12:28.115
* Do it, do it, do it, do it

12:28.148 --> 12:29.449
* Where you at...

12:29.482 --> 12:31.919
There's something wrong
with that hook.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.253
I told you we're gonna
tighten up the verses,

12:33.286 --> 12:34.254
then we gonna
come back to the hook.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.588
I know, but I need to hear

12:35.622 --> 12:36.890
the whole song
in my head, Hakeem.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.425
So, please,

12:38.458 --> 12:40.260
can we just do this my way once?

12:40.293 --> 12:41.728
This ain't about your way!
(music stops)

12:41.761 --> 12:43.831
I'm the producer;
let me produce!

12:43.864 --> 12:45.966
I understand that,
but, see,

12:45.999 --> 12:49.102
you went on Sway
and told them we have

12:49.136 --> 12:51.571
a female group
coming out in three days.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.474
And so now you done
put my name on the line.

12:54.507 --> 12:58.111
So... ladies, can we do
the hook again, please?

12:58.145 --> 12:59.112
Thank you.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.014
Hmm.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.786
Uh...

13:06.820 --> 13:08.188
Valentina?

13:08.221 --> 13:09.689
Oh, what? So now
you know my name?

13:09.722 --> 13:11.791
Uh, bitch,
sing the song before...
Mom!

13:11.825 --> 13:13.360
I bet you would
show Jamal

13:13.393 --> 13:15.395
a lot more trust than
you giving me right now.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.973
Please?

13:28.876 --> 13:30.777
Pretty?

13:30.810 --> 13:34.314
There you go.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.615
Hey.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.451
(music resumes)

13:38.485 --> 13:39.786
* Ooh *

13:39.819 --> 13:41.654
* Can we just be about it?
* Ooh *

13:41.688 --> 13:43.290
* Show me what you're gonna
do about it *

13:43.323 --> 13:45.625
* Do it, do it, do it, shh *

13:45.658 --> 13:47.961
* Shut your mouth and listen

13:47.995 --> 13:49.796
* Don't you know
what you be missin'? *

13:49.829 --> 13:52.399
* I don't want to keep talkin'

13:52.432 --> 13:54.701
* Where you at?
Come get it, just do it *

13:54.734 --> 13:56.636
* Know I like that danger

13:56.669 --> 13:58.671
* But I need a game changer...

13:58.705 --> 14:01.208
It's good, right?
It's good.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.043
* Where you at?
Come get it, just do it... *

14:03.076 --> 14:05.412
Now, all they got to do
is get that choreography,

14:05.445 --> 14:08.315
and I'd say we got us
a gold mine.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.517
* Where you at?
Come get it, just do it. *

14:15.088 --> 14:16.356
(sighs)

14:16.389 --> 14:18.058
WAITRESS:
Here you go, sir.

14:18.091 --> 14:21.128
Thank you, sweetheart.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.064
(chuckles)

14:24.097 --> 14:27.234
So what brings you here?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.269
Well, I, um...

14:29.302 --> 14:31.538
I wanted to talk to you
about Apex Radio.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.173
What about it?
Well, uh, you know,

14:33.206 --> 14:35.508
I was exploring
a merger with them, but...

14:35.542 --> 14:37.777
in truth, their management's
shaky, they're bleeding money.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.413
I think it's the perfect time
to just acquire them wholesale.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.515
And what would that mean
for Empire?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.584
It means
200 urban radio stations.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.254
If you purchase them,
Empire would control

14:47.287 --> 14:49.356
almost all urban content
in broadcast radio.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.757
That's huge, Pop.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.692
And you can deliver this?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.228
Yes, sir.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.764
But I want to talk about
coming back in, Pop.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.767
I'm sorry, Dre.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.569
That's just not even
open for conversation.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.975
I didn't do the hostile takeover
on my own, Pop, okay?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.442
But I'm-I'm here.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.244
I'm trying to take
responsibility like a man.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.947
Nobody else is doing this.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.216
You're a brilliant MBA.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.852
But I could hire 50 other mugs
that can do exactly what you do.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.923
You see, you would have
to bring me something

15:23.957 --> 15:25.993
so unique,
something so incredible,

15:26.026 --> 15:29.997
something that nobody else
could bring me.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.498
Like what?

15:31.531 --> 15:33.533
You name it, Pop. Like what?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.837
Maybe you should pray on it.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.506
(cell phone ringing)

15:41.608 --> 15:43.676
It's your brother.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.612
What's up, Mal?
JAMAL: Just got out of

15:45.645 --> 15:47.680
the studio with this
last producer you sent.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.682
How's that going?
JAMAL: Worse than the last one.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.018
But, look, some girl
just barged in here

15:51.051 --> 15:52.252
talking about
you were gonna sign her.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.453
I don't even know who she is.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.422
I'm on my way now.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.524
I don't know. Security called,
said apparently she showed up

15:57.557 --> 15:59.359
with a bunch of thugs
or something.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.095
Freda-- that's the one
I've been telling you about.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.164
She means everything to me,
musically.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.598
No, you keep her there.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.834
Sign her, Mal,
whatever it takes.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.802
Yeah, a'ight.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.439
Empire wants to
sign you, Freda.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.108
And we're gonna hook you up
and make sure you have

16:15.142 --> 16:16.509
a whole new
level of people.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.378
Where's Lucious?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.547
He's on his way,
but in the meantime,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.115
he wanted you
to sign these.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.184
BECKY:
For an unknown artist, girl,

16:24.217 --> 16:25.352
this is really big.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.453
It's gonna
change your life.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.221
You don't know nothing
about my life.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.157
Huh.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.358
Where you from?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.193
Brownsville?
So?

16:33.226 --> 16:35.695
So, I grew up in Tilden Houses.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.531
Lucious gave me a shot to
get out, and I took it.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.033
When Lucious Lyon
believes in you....

16:40.067 --> 16:41.368
So why he ain't here then?

16:41.401 --> 16:44.571
Man, I can't even read
half these words.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.306
He playing you, sis.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.407
We are not.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.709
This some bull, man.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.579
Lucious Lyon ain't coming
to sign my ass outta no ghetto.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.814
My daddy told me
don't trust him anyway.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.449
Let's get it, yo.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.924
(quietly):
Wow.

17:04.957 --> 17:08.895
You see her evil little ass that
just walked up out of here?

17:08.928 --> 17:12.299
My dad says musically
she's his everything.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.071
The hell's that
supposed to leave me?

17:23.110 --> 17:25.078
* If you really want it that
bad, you go on and get it *

17:25.112 --> 17:26.679
* So I prolly
sing this song forever *

17:26.713 --> 17:28.915
* Since a youngin,
I've been on, but never *

17:28.948 --> 17:32.252
* Had the time to shine,
manipulated my grind *

17:32.285 --> 17:34.787
* Told these haters I would
do it, like how I move it *

17:34.821 --> 17:37.224
* They love the focus
and love the way I pursue it *

17:37.257 --> 17:38.791
* Had to do my own thing...

17:38.825 --> 17:40.026
LUCIOUS:
See that?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.428
(music stops)

17:41.461 --> 17:43.930
How could you
let her go?

17:43.963 --> 17:47.033
All right, look, she's dope,
but I didn't have a choice.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.369
Keem would've signed her.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.938
I-I swear, Mal,
don't make me regret

17:51.971 --> 17:53.640
putting you in the
position I did.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.742
You put me in this position
because I'm an artist--

17:55.775 --> 17:58.245
a real one--
because of my music.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.280
And I held everything down
when you were inside.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.215
I kept everything afloat.
I didn't say anything.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.750
Now you gonna
jump down my throat

18:03.783 --> 18:05.084
because I couldn't sign
some random hood rat.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.619
"Hood rat"?

18:06.653 --> 18:08.388
(chuckles softly)

18:08.421 --> 18:11.891
I was gonna revive an entire
label off of that hood rat.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.793
Yeah, well,
you didn't tell me that.

18:13.826 --> 18:14.794
Which one?

18:14.827 --> 18:16.896
Gutter Life Records.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.266
It's a defunct label,

18:19.299 --> 18:22.469
but they got that raw sound
that I've been looking for.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.837
They wanted to take
Lucious Lyon to the gutter?

18:24.871 --> 18:27.140
Well, I'm gonna show them
what the streets is about.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.741
Lucious, I know where
the girl's at.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.009
I mean, as counselor,

18:30.042 --> 18:31.444
I would advise you not to go,

18:31.478 --> 18:33.112
but you gonna do
what you want to do anyway.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.348
It's that raggedy-ass park
off Dumont Avenue.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.984
See? That's how we get
things done around here.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.653
Look, son, I mean, if you
can't handle the streets,

18:40.687 --> 18:43.323
it's okay, just work harder
at getting your brother back.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.924
Can't handle these streets.
You know what?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.859
With you sweating me
over Hakeem and Freda Gatz

18:46.893 --> 18:49.128
and whoever else you want,
you're forgetting what I need,

18:49.162 --> 18:51.331
both as your artist
and your son.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.932
Dad, say what you want
about Cookie,

18:52.965 --> 18:55.635
but she was always there
when I needed her.

18:55.668 --> 18:59.272
Look, son, you want
some attention from me?

18:59.306 --> 19:03.243
Accomplish what I set out
for you to accomplish, okay?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.648
Come on, man.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.223
(chuckles)

19:16.256 --> 19:18.491
Let me guess.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.561
Those five job offers
never happened?

19:21.594 --> 19:23.830
Are your knees sore?
Did you run out of lubricant?

19:23.863 --> 19:25.064
I get it, I get it.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.666
You are the baddest
bitch ever.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.468
You are badder than
all the animals

19:28.501 --> 19:29.869
whose prints populate
your wardrobe, okay?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.471
Girl, what do you want?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.172
Lucious.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.543
He still thinks
I work here.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.246
At least that's what he said
when I met him this morning.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.349
Oh, you spoke to Lucious?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.852
He reached out to me
about a proposition.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.221
I'm unemployed, so I figured,

19:48.255 --> 19:49.856
why not?

19:49.889 --> 19:52.859
Yeah, but Lucious
is not allowed at Empire,

19:52.892 --> 19:54.427
so...

19:54.461 --> 19:57.830
did you meet him at his house?

19:57.864 --> 20:00.667
I met him at Laviticus,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.869
where he is throwing
a very snazzy,

20:02.902 --> 20:06.105
very large party
in honor of himself.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.707
Mm-hmm.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.477
Of course he is.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.182
But what did he tell you
to make you slither your ass

20:16.215 --> 20:18.951
all the way back to the ghetto?

20:18.985 --> 20:20.086
He wants your music, Cookie.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.220
He wants everything.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.556
Every track
that Hakeem has done.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.893
Tiana, Mirage à Trois, V.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.928
Yeah, yeah, it's an old trick
called "jack your track."

20:28.961 --> 20:31.431
He takes my music,
changes a couple of notes,

20:31.464 --> 20:34.301
puts it out so that I can't
do anything with it.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.902
(chuckles)

20:37.904 --> 20:42.575
Speaking of tricks,
why are you telling me this?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.311
Look.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.546
I understand
how ugly this sounds,

20:46.579 --> 20:50.216
but it is very important to me
to hurt Lucious.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.084
I need it.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.421
So I was hoping
that maybe you might...

20:54.454 --> 20:56.155
if I...

20:56.188 --> 20:58.591
(laughs)

20:58.625 --> 21:01.060
All right.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.862
Anika.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.166
Tell me more about this party

21:07.199 --> 21:09.802
Lucious is
throwing himself tonight.

21:11.538 --> 21:14.140
* Ooh, no doubt about it *

21:14.173 --> 21:15.675
* Mr. Worldwide

21:15.708 --> 21:17.910
* Ooh, no doubt about it *

21:17.944 --> 21:20.847
* Reporting live

21:20.880 --> 21:22.982
* From the Empire,
Jamal, let's show 'em *

21:23.015 --> 21:24.984
* How to get off the chain,
off the glass *

21:25.017 --> 21:26.285
* Off the flip,
off the rip, let's ride *

21:26.319 --> 21:28.355
* All we want is a party

21:28.388 --> 21:30.823
* Have some shots
with somebody *

21:30.857 --> 21:34.594
* Take the music and turn it
all the way up *

21:34.627 --> 21:36.496
* If you came here to party

21:36.529 --> 21:37.964
* And ain't no doubt about it

21:37.997 --> 21:39.866
* Say no doubt about it

21:39.899 --> 21:42.435
* Say ain't no doubt
about it *

21:42.469 --> 21:44.704
* No, no, no, no, no,
no doubt about it *

21:44.737 --> 21:47.006
* Hey
* Ain't no doubt about it *

21:47.039 --> 21:50.142
* Ooh, there ain't
no doubt about it *

21:50.176 --> 21:52.011
* Goin' to the party,
goin' to the party *

21:52.044 --> 21:53.846
* Who they gonna see?
Who they gonna see? *

21:53.880 --> 21:55.948
* It's P-I-T
and your boy Jamal *

21:55.982 --> 21:57.950
* Here we are in the heezy,
everybody say *

21:57.984 --> 22:00.487
* Hey, oh, all right?

22:00.520 --> 22:05.057
* Everybody say,
hey, oh, all right? *

22:05.091 --> 22:06.726
* Baby, if you ain't
on the dance floor *

22:06.759 --> 22:07.960
* Then, baby, what you got
all that for? *

22:07.994 --> 22:09.696
* Let me show you how we do it

22:09.729 --> 22:11.531
* Show her to the club
where the bad ones do it *

22:11.564 --> 22:13.232
* Line up those shots,
throw 'em back, do it *

22:13.265 --> 22:15.301
* Light it, throw it
in the air, do it *

22:15.334 --> 22:17.303
* You want to take it off,
baby, do it *

22:17.336 --> 22:19.038
* In this party,
ain't no social media *

22:19.071 --> 22:20.907
* No camera phones,
so let's get it on *

22:20.940 --> 22:22.975
* Ella dice que
no esta enamorada de mi *

22:23.009 --> 22:25.144
* Pero le gusta
como yo le doy-- si *

22:25.177 --> 22:28.548
* Mami, esta noche fiesta mañana
puedes ser honesta, Dale *

22:28.581 --> 22:30.216
* Don't mean no harm

22:30.249 --> 22:33.653
* Please forgive me
if I'm causing you alarm *

22:33.686 --> 22:38.324
* But the deejay, he just played
my favorite song *

22:38.357 --> 22:41.260
* And you look like
you're ready, so come on *

22:41.293 --> 22:43.730
* Baby, come on, hey

22:43.763 --> 22:45.765
* All we want is a party

22:45.798 --> 22:47.867
* Have some shots
with somebody *

22:47.900 --> 22:50.870
* Take the music and turn it
all the way up *

22:50.903 --> 22:53.773
* If you came here to party

22:53.806 --> 22:56.509
* And ain't no doubt about it

22:56.543 --> 22:59.512
* Say no doubt about it,
say ain't no doubt about it *

22:59.546 --> 23:01.514
* Ain't no, no, no, no, no,
no doubt about it *

23:01.548 --> 23:02.915
* Hey.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.083
(music stops)

23:04.116 --> 23:06.385
MAN:
Yo, where the music at?

23:06.419 --> 23:07.820
(music playing)

23:15.795 --> 23:18.197
Yeah, that's right.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.099
Welcome home, Lucious.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.469
I wouldn't miss
this celebration

23:22.502 --> 23:23.603
for the world.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.937
Welcome home

23:24.971 --> 23:26.573
from your loving family,

23:26.606 --> 23:30.910
and especially from
your loving ex-wife Cookie.

23:30.943 --> 23:34.881
Oh, and welcome to my very own

23:34.914 --> 23:36.916
"Welcome to the World" party.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.552
Oh, you know this next artist.

23:39.586 --> 23:44.290
Yeah, see, he used to be
one of Empire's top rappers,

23:44.323 --> 23:46.593
but he's coming
out of his father's shadow

23:46.626 --> 23:49.061
to develop his own sound.

23:49.095 --> 23:53.600
Give it up for the new label,
Lyon Dynasty,

23:53.633 --> 23:57.403
and our number one artist,
Hakeem Lyon.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.805
(crowd cheering)

23:58.838 --> 24:00.707
(music playing)
* Bounce *

24:03.810 --> 24:05.177
* I'm yelling "Empire's over"

24:05.211 --> 24:07.013
* Dynasty taking over

24:07.046 --> 24:08.447
* Got the game in my palms

24:08.481 --> 24:09.916
* 'Bout to shut down
the Carter *

24:09.949 --> 24:11.317
* No more sitting on benches

24:11.350 --> 24:12.619
* Watching time keep ticking

24:12.652 --> 24:14.020
* Now I'm calling the plays

24:14.053 --> 24:15.454
* You can sit down and listen

24:15.488 --> 24:17.023
* Earned it all, nothing given

24:17.056 --> 24:18.457
* Though I grew up with riches

24:18.491 --> 24:19.859
* Tell little Mally I'm coming

24:19.892 --> 24:21.494
* You number one
on my hit list *

24:21.528 --> 24:23.162
* I'm so ready for war

24:23.195 --> 24:24.597
* Brought my soldiers and all

24:24.631 --> 24:25.865
* You should call on the Lord

24:25.898 --> 24:27.967
* 'Cause you taking the fall

24:28.000 --> 24:30.102
* Now tell me what you gonna
do about that *

24:30.136 --> 24:31.938
* I'm taking everything you own,
lay you on your back *

24:31.971 --> 24:35.307
* Ready for whatever you coming
with, no sneak attack *

24:35.341 --> 24:37.544
* I'm-a bury you so deep,
it ain't no coming back *

24:37.577 --> 24:39.445
* You over like the Mack

24:39.478 --> 24:42.048
* I told you time and time again
that we the ones to beat *

24:42.081 --> 24:44.851
* We uncontrollable,
you tamer than a dog on leash *

24:44.884 --> 24:47.854
* Dynasty, we number one,
and we control the streets *

24:47.887 --> 24:49.722
* Don't play no games
round here *

24:49.756 --> 24:51.290
* We cookin' the beef

24:51.323 --> 24:52.692
* Don't talk about it,

24:52.725 --> 24:54.326
* Got it on lock, we run it

24:54.360 --> 24:55.461
* On top while y'all flop

24:55.494 --> 24:56.495
* All know that we run it

24:56.529 --> 24:58.631
* Took your top spot

24:58.665 --> 25:00.466
* Don't be mad
'cause we run it *

25:00.499 --> 25:02.501
* You had your time,
now it's my time to run it *

25:02.535 --> 25:04.737
* Run it, run it *
* Run it, run it

25:04.771 --> 25:06.505
* Run it, run it,
run it, run it, run it *

25:06.539 --> 25:08.407
* Yo

25:08.440 --> 25:11.243
* I just shut down the building
with that gold on my arm *

25:11.277 --> 25:14.313
* I know she used to be yours,
but I took her to Mars *

25:14.346 --> 25:15.748
* Yeah, I gave her
that feeling *

25:15.782 --> 25:17.183
* I'm the youngest in charge

25:17.216 --> 25:18.551
* You couldn't stand up right

25:18.585 --> 25:20.553
* I'm the stand-up type

25:20.587 --> 25:22.388
* It is the Dynasty,
we take your roster *

25:22.421 --> 25:24.523
* And we did it like a robbery

25:24.557 --> 25:27.526
* That new money, got it
stacking to the balcony *

25:27.560 --> 25:30.663
* I'm the lion, you the cub,
ain't no topping me *

25:30.697 --> 25:32.098
* Pause
(imitates tires screeching)

25:32.131 --> 25:33.833
* Don't talk about it,
we be about it *

25:33.866 --> 25:35.501
* Got it on lock, we run it
* Turn up

25:35.534 --> 25:36.603
* On top while y'all flop

25:36.636 --> 25:38.605
* All know that we run it

25:38.638 --> 25:41.173
* Took your top spot,
don't be mad 'cause we run it *

25:41.207 --> 25:43.676
* You had your turn,

25:43.710 --> 25:46.913
* Run it, run it, run it *
* Run it, run it, run it...

25:46.946 --> 25:48.247
Hurry up, hurry
up, get the chip.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.049
Make sure you
get that chip.

25:50.082 --> 25:53.152
(clamoring)

25:55.554 --> 25:56.923
Hurry up.
(music stops)

25:56.956 --> 25:58.891
(microphone squeals, thumps)

26:00.727 --> 26:02.561
Damn, Cookie, now
that's a move.

26:02.595 --> 26:04.563
Yeah, you know, we need
to talk about Lyon Dynasty

26:04.597 --> 26:06.565
doing a huge set at
your New Year's Eve special.
Hmm. Yeah?

26:06.599 --> 26:08.968
Hey, if you put it down
like you did tonight,

26:09.001 --> 26:10.569
you can have your
own stage in Miami.

26:10.603 --> 26:11.804
Bet.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.614
(phones ringing)
Lyon Dynasty, please hold.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.115
Lyon Dynasty,
please hold.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.917
You know a girl had to
make a grand entrance.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.219
Can I get you
to sign this please?

26:27.253 --> 26:29.622
Everybody, shut up!

26:29.656 --> 26:32.625
Cookie can't have
everybody talking at once!

26:32.659 --> 26:34.393
Say that again, Sway.
It's crazy here, baby.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.797
I said Lyon Dynasty
came out the gates

26:37.830 --> 26:39.398
blazin' last night,

26:39.431 --> 26:42.635
bum-rushing the stage
like KRS did PM Dawn.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.070
The Bridge is over.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.472
The Bridge is over.
(scats, laughs)

26:46.505 --> 26:48.908
Yeah, you see, we bringing
that real hip-hop back.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.778
See, that's what
the Lyon Dynasty's all about.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.013
I don't know
what to tell you guys.
(girls arguing)

26:54.046 --> 26:56.082
Listen. No, no, no, listen.
We already spoke about it!

26:56.115 --> 26:58.317
MALA: You can't just take
my solo without talking to me.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.819
Who said they're
your solos?

26:59.852 --> 27:01.921
Ugh, I'm so sick of
your mouth, girl!

27:01.954 --> 27:03.756
VALENTINA:
You couldn't find a C major

27:03.790 --> 27:06.358
if it was right in between
your legs, which it ain't.

27:06.392 --> 27:07.660
CARMEN:
Oh, my God.

27:07.694 --> 27:08.695
(arguing continues)

27:08.728 --> 27:10.629
Wow.
What do you want?

27:10.663 --> 27:11.964
I'm just here to see Mom.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.933
How's it going?

27:13.966 --> 27:16.202
We're on Sway in two days.
You sure you want to risk that?

27:16.235 --> 27:19.605
With Dad coming for you
the way that he is?
Bring it.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.641
COOKIE: Well, you can always
come back here with us, Dre.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.013
Empire's where I belong, Mom.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.447
That company's part of me.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.851
But more importantly,

27:31.884 --> 27:34.286
I have a vision for Empire.

27:34.320 --> 27:39.125
Now, I want it to be something
that I would be proud...

27:39.158 --> 27:42.294
to leave my own... child.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.164
That's what I was
trying to do here, Dre.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.836
You and Rhonda?

27:49.869 --> 27:50.903
Yeah.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.905
(gasps)

27:52.939 --> 27:54.907
(laughs)

27:54.941 --> 27:57.343
Oh, my God!

27:57.376 --> 27:59.578
Oh, Dre.
Thank you.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.685
So, um...

28:08.788 --> 28:10.757
Did you tell Lucious?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.358
No.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.993
Why would I do that, Mom?

28:14.026 --> 28:18.397
Uh, Dre, you just
answered your own wish.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.532
Lucious wants the
same thing you do.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.334
That's why he's
so hell-bent

28:22.368 --> 28:25.071
about getting Hakeem
back over there.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.506
He wants his own legacy.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.944
And nothing says legacy
like a grandchild.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.380
You saw how he
acted with Lola.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.448
He about melted
with that little girl.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.450
I can't.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.452
And I won't use my unborn child

28:40.486 --> 28:42.454
as leverage with him
or anybody else.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.757
I won't do it. No.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.793
Listen to me, boy.

28:49.295 --> 28:53.099
All I'm saying is,
sometimes,

28:53.132 --> 28:56.969
you got to pull at those
heartstrings to get paid.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.371
Ain't nothing
wrong with that.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.606
(chuckles)

29:00.639 --> 29:02.608
Think about it.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.643
Okay.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.582
(footsteps approaching)

29:13.585 --> 29:16.588
I'll tell you one thing, son,
you sure are persistent.

29:18.791 --> 29:21.627
I hope you got something
better than last time.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.629
(sighs)

29:23.662 --> 29:25.664
I do have news.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.504
And I wanted to share it
with you face-to-face.

29:32.538 --> 29:33.973
Rhonda's pregnant.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.810
You're gonna be a grandfather.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.113
For real?

29:41.147 --> 29:43.215
(chuckles):
Yeah.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.318
Aren't you worried?

29:46.352 --> 29:48.520
About what?

29:48.554 --> 29:51.824
The child's mental health.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.625
Bipolar doesn't run
in our family, Dad.

29:53.659 --> 29:55.427
There's nothing
to worry about.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.864
LEAH: Dwight, baby,
did you really think

29:57.897 --> 29:59.598
I'd forget your birthday?

29:59.631 --> 30:01.600
DWIGHT: But my birthday's
not till next month.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.002
LEAH: We're gonna
celebrate it now.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.871
Look at all this stuff.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.005
(plays note, laughs)

30:15.414 --> 30:16.849
(chuckles softly)

30:20.352 --> 30:23.222
A heir? A grandson?

30:23.255 --> 30:25.892
Yes, sir, that's right.
That's right, Pop.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.960
(laughs)
And with this child,

30:27.994 --> 30:29.495
everything, a new path
is becoming clear.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.998
I got feeling about
a second phase for Empire.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.732
(laughs)

30:33.765 --> 30:35.567
Always wanted a grandson.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.336
(laughs)

30:37.369 --> 30:39.405
That's good, 'cause
you're gonna get one.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.440
Congratulations.

30:43.209 --> 30:47.179
But I swear to you,
you are breaking my heart,

30:47.213 --> 30:50.582
the fact that you are
using this right now...

30:50.616 --> 30:53.052
to get what you want from me.

30:57.056 --> 31:00.026
I'm not using this, Pop.

31:00.059 --> 31:01.760
I'm just letting you know

31:01.793 --> 31:03.562
that there's more at
stake than just me now.

31:03.595 --> 31:06.565
Pop, there's more at stake
than just me, you hear me?

31:06.598 --> 31:08.734
I need this. There's more
at stake than just me.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.270
Yeah.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.305
You give Rhonda my love, okay?

31:24.883 --> 31:27.886
(playing slow, haunting tune)

31:45.972 --> 31:48.774
DWIGHT:
We need to eat, Mama.

31:48.807 --> 31:51.277
We need to eat.

31:51.310 --> 31:55.847
And we can't eat until
we take all this stuff back.

32:03.655 --> 32:07.459
DWIGHT: * La, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la *

32:07.493 --> 32:11.630
* La, la, la, la, la,
la-la, la-la, la *

32:11.663 --> 32:14.666
(indistinct singing echoes)

32:23.842 --> 32:26.745
FREDA: * School days, free
lunch line, you behind you *

32:26.778 --> 32:28.814
* Some of the wackest dudes,
I spy, too *

32:28.847 --> 32:30.516
* I'm the realest here,
the trillest, yeah *

32:30.549 --> 32:32.251
* I heard the street say
you a ghost *

32:32.284 --> 32:34.253
* 'Cause your heart
we know was never there *

32:34.286 --> 32:35.521
* You got me feeling like

32:35.554 --> 32:36.622
* I done had enough now

32:36.655 --> 32:38.124
* No time to cluck round

32:38.157 --> 32:39.958
* I make these chickens
duck down, one up *

32:39.992 --> 32:42.028
* You say you a shooter,
then pick your gun up *

32:42.061 --> 32:44.463
* I'm here, boy,
20/20, I'm clear, boy *

32:44.496 --> 32:45.797
* More chicken
than magic Monday *

32:45.831 --> 32:47.633
* Make a hater disappear, boy

32:47.666 --> 32:50.169
* I swear, boy, you ain't
nowhere in my vertical *

32:50.202 --> 32:51.770
* Serving who?
Hell, you mean, boy? *

32:51.803 --> 32:53.139
She's good.
* We never heard of you

32:53.172 --> 32:54.540
* Freda been about that

32:54.573 --> 32:55.974
* Ask your chick about that.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.409
(crowd cheering)

33:00.379 --> 33:03.315
* Yo, came from the projects,
wanting more *

33:03.349 --> 33:06.452
* All-nighters trappin'
in front of the corner store *

33:06.485 --> 33:08.787
* Bitch, you's irrelevant,
you don't even matter *

33:08.820 --> 33:11.790
* I splatter your brains like
them cats did "Stank" Gathers. *

33:11.823 --> 33:12.924
(crowd cheering)

33:14.926 --> 33:17.496
That's how these females get,
man-- weak.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.699
What, you gonna cry now?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.371
Hold up! Baby!

33:25.404 --> 33:26.838
(gunfire, crowd screaming)

33:28.207 --> 33:30.042
Let me go!

33:30.076 --> 33:32.244
Stop! Come on.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.012
Your father didn't
want this for you.

33:34.046 --> 33:36.548
You've got something, and it
don't come around every day.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.818
But, baby, you got it. Let me
help you do something with it.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.420
Mr. Lyons, now, unless
you like prison, we got to go.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.255
FREDA:
My daddy was a crazy man,

33:43.289 --> 33:46.492
and you don't know
a damn thing about that.
I promise you I do.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.095
No.
You know we gonna run
on these fools, Fre!

33:49.128 --> 33:53.265
Baby, don't do something that
you can't come back from.

33:53.299 --> 33:56.668
MAN:
Come on, Fre.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.638
Let me help you.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.041
MAN: Come on, Fre.
(sirens wailing in distance)

34:03.075 --> 34:05.911
We out!

34:05.944 --> 34:08.347
(sirens approaching)
THIRSTY:
Got to get you out of here.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.449
I have to get you
out of here. Come on.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.883
JAMAL:
I'm telling you,

34:11.917 --> 34:13.952
it's this war
between my mom and dad.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.422
It's killing everything,
especially the music.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.857
I don't care.
Like hell.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.626
After last night, I definitely
need a producer that fits me.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.295
What was wrong
with this last producer, huh?

34:23.329 --> 34:25.597
What's wrong with the guy
that crafted club bangers

34:25.631 --> 34:27.099
for Ri-Ri, Nicki and Usher?

34:27.133 --> 34:29.368
Too damn arrogant.
Arrogant?

34:29.401 --> 34:31.237
Wasn't the last one
too nice though?

34:31.270 --> 34:33.739
The one before that was...
too quirky.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.241
The one before that
was too short,

34:35.274 --> 34:37.309
and the one before that
was too tall.

34:37.343 --> 34:40.546
Don't smirk at me like I don't
know what I'm talking about.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.382
Lucious has been sending you
the top producers in the game,

34:43.415 --> 34:44.950
and you are not even...

34:44.983 --> 34:46.652
Ooh! (sighs) Forget it.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.420
Why don't you just call her, yo?

34:48.454 --> 34:51.056
I don't know
who "her" is.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.058
"Her" is Cookie,
and you know it.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.794
She's the only one that knows
how to deal with your moody ass.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.996
I know that Cookie and Lucious
got beef right now,

34:58.029 --> 35:00.098
but that ain't got nothing
to do with you.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.967
Don't let that
be the reason,

35:02.000 --> 35:03.335
'cause you need her.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.171
And more importantly,
she loves you.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.274
I want you to get some people

35:08.307 --> 35:10.442
over to her house,
get her to me.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.344
What the hell is...
What is this?

35:12.378 --> 35:14.146
Why am I not surprised

35:14.180 --> 35:17.816
to find you down here among the
bottom-feeders and criminals?

35:17.849 --> 35:19.751
Have I broken any laws? No.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.621
Not yet,
but the night is young.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.122
Miss Ford,
this is borderline harassment

35:24.156 --> 35:25.991
and a bit desperate
if you ask me.

35:26.024 --> 35:27.293
Look, don't say another word.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.760
No, I'm starting to think

35:28.794 --> 35:30.496
Miss Ford is a little sweet
on Lucious.

35:30.529 --> 35:33.665
Look, why don't you
come by and, uh,

35:33.699 --> 35:36.168
we'll take care of all this
tension we've been building up.

35:36.202 --> 35:39.137
Your client is
on very thin ice, Counselor.

35:39.171 --> 35:40.772
Then I imagine
you are, too,

35:40.806 --> 35:42.508
seeing as you're standing
right next to him.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.809
(Lucious laughs)

35:43.842 --> 35:45.444
You're never gonna find
Vernon Turner.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.846
We've got him hidden far away.

35:47.879 --> 35:51.116
Then why are you here?

35:51.149 --> 35:54.353
Apparently, he must
not be cooperating.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.224
Your case is stalled.

35:58.257 --> 36:01.660
I want you to know this.

36:01.693 --> 36:05.997
As long as this case is open,
I have a license to dig.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.834
A murder rap...

36:08.867 --> 36:11.770
is only the beginning
of what I have planned for you.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.709
(scoffs)

36:17.743 --> 36:19.511
Let's go.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.314
Wait till you see what I got
planned for you, Miss Ford.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.015
You're gonna like it.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.923
(music playing)
COOKIE: Five, six,

36:31.957 --> 36:35.093
seven, eight
and walk, walk.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.062
Walk! I need attitude!

36:37.095 --> 36:40.165
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
She off.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.434
Stop. Do it again.
Do you want to be here?!

36:42.468 --> 36:45.304
More attitude, more attitude!

36:46.638 --> 36:49.040
Do we know
what we doing here?!

36:49.074 --> 36:51.477
Five, six, seven, eight!

36:52.478 --> 36:54.280
Come on, let's go, ladies.

36:54.313 --> 36:56.181
Oh, oh. Okay.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.349
Put your back into it.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.385
Up, up, ladies. Knees up.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.354
Up! Yes, that's right, ladies.
Up, up, up.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.723
Higher! High...
Porsha, stop with all of that!

37:04.756 --> 37:07.225
I'm just making sure
you ain't going soft.

37:07.259 --> 37:08.627
Well, wait!
Somebody's off.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.529
Stop. Stop.
Drop, give me 20.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.964
(whistle blows,
cane tapping on floor)

37:14.933 --> 37:17.303
No, not those push-ups.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.570
Knees up, ladies.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.105
I want push-ups
with your knees up!

37:20.138 --> 37:21.640
You ain't no punk.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.776
Yes. Y'all...

37:24.810 --> 37:26.945
Y-You're not in sync.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.114
I'm not doing
this right now.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.149
I'm a singer.
I'm not a soldier.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.918
(chuckles)

37:34.920 --> 37:38.757
You think just 'cause
you slept with my son

37:38.790 --> 37:41.059
that you don't have
to work for it?

37:41.092 --> 37:42.461
It's not like
that with Hakeem.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.430
I worked my ass
off to get here,

37:44.463 --> 37:46.097
and I don't need to
sleep with anybody

37:46.131 --> 37:47.766
to get to where
I want to be.

37:47.799 --> 37:51.470
Prove it, because that's not
what the rest of the world

37:51.503 --> 37:53.104
is gonna say about you

37:53.138 --> 37:55.841
if you don't knock this thing
out the park tomorrow.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.246
Yes!

38:01.279 --> 38:03.915
Less lip, more work.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.417
See, y'all want fame,

38:05.451 --> 38:07.519
but you don't want
to put in the work.

38:07.553 --> 38:09.321
Everybody wants to be Beyoncé,

38:09.355 --> 38:10.922
but you don't want
to put in the work!

38:10.956 --> 38:13.425
* Do it, do it, do it, shh
Let's go!

38:13.459 --> 38:15.661
* Shut your mouth and listen

38:15.694 --> 38:17.996
Better. Better.
* Don't you know
what you be missin' *

38:18.029 --> 38:20.131
* I don't want to keep talkin'

38:20.165 --> 38:22.000
* Where you at?
Come get it, just do it *

38:22.033 --> 38:24.269
* Know I like that danger

38:24.302 --> 38:27.172
Uh-oh.
* But I need a game changer

38:27.205 --> 38:29.107
* Want it sooner than later

38:29.140 --> 38:31.710
* Where you at?
Come get it, just do it *

38:31.743 --> 38:34.045
* Do it, do it, do it, do it
* Do it *

38:34.079 --> 38:36.281
* Do it, do it, do
* Oh-oh *

38:36.314 --> 38:38.684
* Do it, do it, do it, do it

38:38.717 --> 38:40.886
* Where you at?
Come get it, just do it *
Finally!

38:40.919 --> 38:43.154
Finally! Yes!
* Do it, do it, do it, do it

38:43.188 --> 38:46.558
* Do it, do it, do,
do it, do it *
* Oh-oh *

38:46.592 --> 38:49.961
* Do it, do it, where you at?
Come get it, just do it... *

38:49.995 --> 38:52.564
Damn, Mom. You really
whipped them in shape.

38:52.598 --> 38:53.832
Where you learn this from?

38:53.865 --> 38:56.568
Prison.
* Where you at, boy?

38:56.602 --> 38:59.170
* Where you at?
Come get it, just do it. *
(whoops)

39:06.344 --> 39:09.347
(faintly):
* Do it, do it, do it, do it

39:09.381 --> 39:10.916
* Do it, do it, do
* Oh-oh *

39:10.949 --> 39:12.951
* Do it, do it...

39:22.428 --> 39:24.830
How'd you know?

39:24.863 --> 39:26.331
Don't get all paranoid.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.534
I talked to Becky this morning.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.268
I know.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.070
I don't get why you
can forgive Hakeem,

39:32.103 --> 39:33.772
but I can't have a
truce with Cookie.

39:33.805 --> 39:36.542
Have you forgotten what your
mother's trying to do to me?

39:36.575 --> 39:40.746
She's building a company
to deliberately hurt me.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.714
She tried to take
Empire from me.

39:42.748 --> 39:45.016
She tried to take it from you.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.453
Yeah, but none of
that matters anymore.

39:47.486 --> 39:50.121
It don't. You said it--
the music matters.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.123
And it's got
to come out.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.192
I'm telling you,
I'm on one, Dad,

39:54.225 --> 39:56.094
but those producers that
you sent me, they...

39:56.127 --> 39:58.063
I'm way past them.
Way past them.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.598
But I do need someone.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.066
I need... I need a Cookie.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.568
No, that's where you're wrong.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.870
You don't need nobody.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.472
You're past Cookie.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.807
Tell me how that is.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.409
Look at where you've been, man.

40:11.443 --> 40:14.980
You've gone through
dark corridors of humanity.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.148
What woman's gonna
understand that

40:17.182 --> 40:19.117
and relate it in your music?

40:19.150 --> 40:20.552
What man can understand that?

40:20.586 --> 40:24.122
You need a god
to produce you.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.825
I'm gonna produce you.

40:30.295 --> 40:32.130
Yo, I'm serious.
I'm on one.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.765
You think I'm playing?

40:33.799 --> 40:36.001
I'm talking about
straight to the top.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.969
(laughs)

40:38.003 --> 40:41.106
And I ain't playing second
fiddle to no Freda Gatz

40:41.139 --> 40:44.175
or no Shucky Ducky,
quack, quack,

40:44.209 --> 40:46.645
or whoever else you want
to bring on board.
(laughs)

40:46.678 --> 40:48.413
I'm serious, Dad.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.115
Superstar status.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.951
I think I know
something about that.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.986
You're the one.

40:55.020 --> 40:57.789
Thank you for pushing me.

40:57.823 --> 41:01.092
* Drop that kitty down low,
pop that kitty down low *

41:01.126 --> 41:03.361
* Drop that kitty down low

41:03.394 --> 41:06.464
* Hey, I know
you want it all... *

41:06.498 --> 41:08.800
Where is this bitch?

41:08.834 --> 41:10.769
Where the hell is Valentina?
They can't go on without her.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.170
I'm checking on
her car right now.

41:12.203 --> 41:13.539
She better get
her ass up here.

41:13.572 --> 41:14.873
* I know you want it all

41:14.906 --> 41:17.709
* I'm giving you enough...

41:17.743 --> 41:19.444
What are you doing here?

41:19.477 --> 41:23.048
Oh, the same thing
you were doing at my party.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.850
Except when I
crash a venue,

41:24.883 --> 41:25.851
I own it.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.986
What are you talking
about, Lucious?

41:28.019 --> 41:29.521
I bought Apex Radio.

41:29.555 --> 41:30.522
Empire now has

41:30.556 --> 41:31.690
a controlling interest in

41:31.723 --> 41:33.191
every urban outlet

41:33.224 --> 41:36.528
and in every major market
in the country.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.530
Wait. Mom...
Hakeem.

41:38.564 --> 41:41.066
Well, see, y'all keep acting
like y'all don't know me,

41:41.099 --> 41:43.301
so y'all gonna have
to learn the hard way.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.503
Now your artists
got to suffer.

41:45.537 --> 41:46.905
COOKIE:
Lucious,

41:46.938 --> 41:49.307
you can't do this.
No, I already did it.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.577
And don't forget,
I invited your ungrateful ass

41:51.610 --> 41:54.479
back into my Empire,
and you spit in my face.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.481
Sorry I'm late.
HAKEEM:
Forget it, girl.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.317
My dad took hating to
a whole nother level.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.352
He gonna cancel your performance
to get back at us.

42:01.386 --> 42:03.354
LUCIOUS: (chuckles)
See how little he knows?

42:03.388 --> 42:06.024
She's our next guest.
What do you mean,
your next guest?

42:06.057 --> 42:07.859
Oh, I signed her this morning.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.264
I'm sorry, Hakeem.

42:13.298 --> 42:15.100
LUCIOUS:
No. Baby, come here.

42:15.133 --> 42:17.769
Don't you ever apologize
for making the right move.

42:17.803 --> 42:20.005
You want be star, you need
a real label behind you.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.573
Why don't you get in there

42:21.607 --> 42:23.408
and shine, baby.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.777
I'm gonna make your ass
pay for this.

42:25.811 --> 42:29.280
Y'all know about this?
SWAY: You rockin' with
Sway live on the radio,

42:29.314 --> 42:32.250
and Valentina is here,
just like I promised y'all.

42:32.283 --> 42:33.451
Hi.
All right, beautiful.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.520
LUCIOUS:
Now, without radio,

42:35.553 --> 42:38.624
your little label
dries up and dies.

42:38.657 --> 42:41.526
So rest in peace, baby.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.129
You keep forgetting, Lucious.

42:44.162 --> 42:46.164
You can't keep Cookie down.

42:49.434 --> 42:52.037
* I know that
when I step up in the room *

42:52.070 --> 42:53.605
* All eyes is on me

42:53.639 --> 42:56.474
* I got that heat,
that fire... *
Come on, Hakeem.

42:56.507 --> 42:59.911
Huh, little baby lion cub?

42:59.945 --> 43:01.947
* Round of applause
lead to standing ovations... *

43:01.980 --> 43:03.715
Oh, well.

43:03.749 --> 43:06.117
* Standing ovations lead
to selling out the stadiums *

43:06.151 --> 43:09.988
* Radios on, now I'm heard
on every station *

43:10.021 --> 43:13.324
* I'm what you waiting for,
now watch me take the nation. *

43:16.828 --> 43:18.830
(sighs)
