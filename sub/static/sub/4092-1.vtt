Do you believe
in order over landscape?

look back to Rome or to the Renaissance.

surely,

11:38.760 --> 11:41.730

uniquely French

nature to our will,

21:56.720 --> 21:58.609
according to
the present plans.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.648
But, <i>monsieur,</i>
the money being spent.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.684
The aqueduct will
carry sufficient water

22:02.800 --> 22:04.768
to the gardens of
Versailles because it must.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.524
That is your brief.

22:06.720 --> 22:07.881
<i>Madame?</i>

22:09.800 --> 22:11.768
It is essentially your plan,

22:12.240 --> 22:14.607

submission, I believe.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.921
This part is entirely
original to myself.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.366
You see?

22:21.760 --> 22:23.888
It fits onto this
end of your plan.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.842
Now you can see the
extent of the enterprise.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.361
Yes.

22:30.320 --> 22:33.369
It's a large, flat area.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.491
An arena with tiered sides.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.120
Indeed.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.410
The orchestra

22:47.120 --> 22:48.406

23:22.160 --> 23:23.321

reworking the plans.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.080

24:54.520 --> 24:56.409
a reservoir
at the top of the hill,

24:56.560 --> 24:58.403
we would have enough water
to run the fountains

24:58.480 --> 25:00.369
and the building works.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.250
We don't need water continually
if we just recycle it.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.005
Pressure will force it
back up to the start again.

25:07.080 --> 25:10.050
And there's a river,

25:11.600 --> 25:14.080
here, underground.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.723

Of course.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.605
Well, thank you, madame.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.563
I will examine
these in more detail.

if this adds to the turmoil.

her house was on fire.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.607
We felt sure this would
end her winning streak.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.047
Apparently not.
The marquise played on.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.202
Her children were safe,
what could she do?

26:33.680 --> 26:36.889

27:00.960 --> 27:02.803
They are.
I see.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.569
Button these
gloves for me, Andre.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.569
Perhaps that's what
makes us a good match.

Appropriate?

40:42.840 --> 40:45.969
Last year, we had the Nymphs

40:46.040 --> 40:49.283
and it was not a bit funny,
all those haggard faces under flaxen wigs.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.726
I believe you did.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.605
And perennials.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.571
You like flowers, master?

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.491
<i>Madame</i> de Barra,
I love all flowers passionately.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.961
However, I am banished
from using as many <i>as</i> I would like

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.963
at Versailles by
the Master Le Notre.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.850
He indulges me in
a few small parterres.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.400
I'd hoped to be able to convert
him when we took up residence.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.090
However...

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.321
Oh!

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.601
You're wise
to me now, <i>madame.</i>

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.930
May we ignore all that
and continue as before?

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.522
Today, I am

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.363
<i>Monsieur</i> de la Quintinie.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.841
Indeed.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.371
And you are.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.727
You are the better for
the move to Versailles, sire?

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.404
Very much.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.448
It's good for the children
to be away from the city.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.091
I know it's a crush
for everybody.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.646
I felt, though,
that I should never get the builders out

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.324
unless I moved in.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.249
You are familiar with builders,
<i>Madame</i> de Barra?

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.006
At present, I am building in
your gardens at Versailles.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.444
Which construction
would that be?

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.610
The Rockwork Grove.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.611
I am familiar with it.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.246
I cannot claim it
entirely as my own.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.445
Master Le Notre took
a simple sketch of mine

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.007
and made it outstanding, so...

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.766
You see my reluctance.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.842
You admire the master,
<i>madame?</i>

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.209
He is the most
complete person I know.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.203
You make me lonely for
someone to describe me thus.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.965
These are your flowers?

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.481
My wife died recently.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.766
Did you hear?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.160
I did, sire.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.125
I remember the day
of your marriage.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.810
I hope so,
it cost enough.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.410
Though her father paid
for a large portion.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.843
Astray in his wits,
bless him.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.368
A long bloodline,
never a good thing.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.771
She was an innocent, really.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.490
But she was nice.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.808
And devoted to me.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.488
I found this after she died.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.682
It's just an account
of our lives.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.321
The writing's like a child's.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.370
"Today I saved a flower
from His Majesty."

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.283
And then the time
and the place.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.371
This little woman's
secret life.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.688
I feel the loss of it.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.522
I should like to marry again.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.211
This time someone I choose,

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.126
not the state.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.729
Has Your Majesty
someone in mind?

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.002
I have,
but the lady's very pious.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:17.401
Most evenings I stroll over to her rooms,
and we just sit and talk.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.165
But it is
the ease of it I like.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.010
The ease.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.042
Unfortunately,
she is of no birth,

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.726
so, you see,
I am at a little impasse.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.808
If you were to be
married to

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.409
the lady of your choosing,

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.805
would it be necessary
for everyone to know?

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.370
If the ceremony were private,
between the couple,

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.803
who would be in a position
to argue the outcome?

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.884
They would be foolish to do so afterwards,
when it was done.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.281
Mmm.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.086

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.806
What pulse drives you?

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.970
There is someone you love?

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.691
I cannot say.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.921
Why?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.484
Because...
Because of something private.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.961
What is so private that it
cannot be shared in love?

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.250
The time has come, <i>madame,</i>

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.564
for us both
to face down our past

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.722

I shall write a letter
from one gardener to another,

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.322
It will bring you
to the court,

there were activities.

must have forgotten.

I will travel there alone.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.051
I'm a builder, <i>madame.</i>

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.322

So be it.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.720
However, I must request that

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.683
you keep it
separate from our lives.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.805
If this liaison
became common knowledge,

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.160
it would make me
a laughingstock.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.361
It makes my flesh crawl.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:50.841
I remind you, madame,
that it was you who embarked on this path.

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:55.603
You and only you
dictated how we live now,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.365

Andre, you must make
the sensible choice here.

Do not exclude me,
I beg you.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.205

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.004
Like a well-trained plant.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.491
Am I part
of an amusement for you?

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.126
Not at all.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.049
I'm unused to all this.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.001

No.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.771
I have not been honest since
I watched you in my garden.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.921
Your heart beats fiercely.
Mine just ticks.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.288
I have not gifts
to offer such a wonder.

I'll feed you.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.570

you will tell me.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.931
You are not mad.

so to speak, Your Majesty.

Even now, the setbacks
were due to nature, sire.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.684
Perfection does
not bow to nature.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.205
What on earth
are those things?

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.684
<font color="#808080">DURAS:</font> Well, sire,
I'm glad you asked me that, because that, really,

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.285
is what <i>Madame</i> de Barra is.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.447
Odd, sire.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.891
May I show Your Majesty?

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.808
You will recall what I said
about Nymphs and Shepherds.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.009
As we age,
we see things more clearly.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.731
This project,

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.162
is it worthy of us?

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.967
There's no precedent
for <i>Madame</i> de Barra's vision.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.963
Trust is all we can give to those
who reach into the new, sire.

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.726
But when beauty can be
described with such imagination,

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.246
then her art,
above all I know,

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.169
is worthy of the king.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.968
I see only mud.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.362

we will weigh later.

For now,
inform <i>Madame</i> de Barra

at Fontainebleau.

I do not know

what story this tells

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.367
or what harm it is part of.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.527
This is a bad end
for both of us,

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.850

Indeed. However, some of the

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.610
I am bound to say,
I see no trace of that challenge in you.

Do not talk to me
about it, <i>madame.</i>

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.048
I am ruined by the expense,
and worse,

You see how they
look at you?

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.442
You are no one where
everybody is someone,

and yet you are here.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.965
That makes you
more the someone.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.364
Especially if you
have conversation.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.205

not have you yet.

Heavens, the lengths
I've had to go to, <i>madame.</i>

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.290
I have had to bribe, lie and use
every form of deception to meet you.

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.920
How much did you pay
the maître d'hôtel?

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.450
Five gold louis.
Was that too much?

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.760

I had the king's interest.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.323
Is this your first time
at Fontainebleau?

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.209
It is.
Have you no birth?

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.362
Not a drop.
No blood whatsoever.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.841

offer you Lauzun,

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:25.361

Yet you're not
blackened by the sun.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.606
Perhaps a little.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.490

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.280
Would you like to see mine?
Mine are the most beautiful.

Yes, they are,
apart from Suzanne, who's 70.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.684
Oh, yes, hers are perfect.

my son on the battlefield.

They died in
each other's arms.

I'm barely here.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:06.601

from one state to another,

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.607
I'm obliged to you, <i>madame,</i>
for that sweet reminder.

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.610
Now walk with me.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.242
And tell me of

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.967
your progress in our garden.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.289
Her kindness,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.490
unbribed.

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.089
That was
very brave tonight.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.926
I hoped he might listen.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.331
Enough humility.

Philippe.

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:28.440
You're dressed.

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.124
I'm off on business to Chartres.

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.200
Thought I would
take Marie-Claire.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.808
There's a good puppet
stand and a pie shop.

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.644
Marie-Claire!
Are you there?

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.087
Papa! Did you find her?

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.130

<font color="#808080">MARIE-CLAIRE:</font> You naughty doll!

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.049
Come here and I
shall punish you.

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.564
Oh, my goodness.
Is she all right?

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.608
Don't be silly.
She's made of cloth.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.244
Sabine, I have
something to tell you.

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.361
<font color="#808080">SABINE:</font> <i>How long?</i>

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:05.960
<font color="#808080">DE BARRA:</font> <i>We've not been close of late.</i>

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.761
And most men take mistresses in
clue course in such circumstances.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.366
Such circumstances?

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:15.925
What's her name?

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.526
Diane.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:19.647
Where does she live?

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.087
Berry.

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:23.441
Oh.

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.606
Not too far.

There's the coach now.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.730
We'll talk again
on this matter.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.611
When will you be back?

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.641
This evening, <i>madame.</i>

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.249
Do not <i>"madame"</i> me,
Philippe.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.086
Marie-Claire, tie your laces.
You'll fall over them.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.606
I can't, Mama.
Wait there.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.205
Master, look at this.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.171
Marie-Claire.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.529
Marie-Claire.

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.771
Jean, the wheel.

01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.444
<font color="#808080">JEAN:</font> I told the master.

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:19.965
He said it would
do until Berry.

Berry?

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.930
Marie-Claire!

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.720
I did not kiss Mama.

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:40.491
She was the most
beautiful thing I ever made,

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.961
and I killed her.

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:49.931
Did you intend them to die?
Is that what you planned?

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.402
It was...
It was your husband's choice.

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.641
He took away the child.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.926
No, it was my fault.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.401
It was my fault.
I let him take her away.

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:00.843
What if no one
person is to blame?

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.480
And what use is blame?

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.886
It is enough to
have it happen to you.

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.689
It is enough to
recover from it.

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.489
That is as much as we
may ask of ourselves.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.800
That is enough.

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.809
What is it that
would help you?

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.851
If you held me.

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.443
What will happen
to your wife?

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.602
This was not
the way we started.

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:52.051
So we must have taught
each other how to behave.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.648
I am to blame for it
as much as she.

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.442
She will live her own life.

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.564
She knows that now.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.245
And us?

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.285
We will shape each other.

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.450
This isn't the right way.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:51.444
Yes, it is. We're behind that fence.
Oh!

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.565
For heaven's sake!

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:55.771

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.366
