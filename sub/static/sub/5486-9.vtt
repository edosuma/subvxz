WEBVTT

00:03.950 --> 00:06.189
You know, I thought 500
bucks for four sessions

00:06.190 --> 00:07.490
was kind of a rip-off,

00:07.491 --> 00:09.425
but I think this music class
is really helping my son

00:09.426 --> 00:11.794
get his foot in the door
of the music industry.

00:11.795 --> 00:13.729
Now, don't be afraid to
share your instruments,

00:13.730 --> 00:15.031
little buddies.

00:15.032 --> 00:18.334
In music, networking is
just as important as talent.

00:18.335 --> 00:19.869
I see it as an investment.

00:19.870 --> 00:21.237
This is a great extra-curricular

00:21.238 --> 00:23.606
for Gratitude's
preschool applications.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.441
Where's Leo applying?

00:25.442 --> 00:27.210
Preschool? Look at him.

00:27.211 --> 00:28.611
He's just a little
blob with eyes.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.479
You mean you haven't started

00:30.480 --> 00:33.082
the preschool
application process yet?

00:33.083 --> 00:34.550
Dana and I started
looking at schools

00:34.551 --> 00:36.919
before the pregnancy test
even came back positive

00:36.920 --> 00:38.654
for little Sriracha.

00:38.655 --> 00:40.089
Why would I spend
money on private school

00:40.090 --> 00:41.557
when public school is free?

00:41.558 --> 00:44.460
I mean, why else am
I sometimes paying my taxes?

00:44.461 --> 00:45.928
Public school.

00:45.929 --> 00:48.564
Is Leo's father a politician
trying to seem less white?

00:48.565 --> 00:49.799
Okay, you know what?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.334
I went to public school
and I turned out amazing.

00:51.335 --> 00:53.836
It's also where I learned
how to throw a knife.

00:53.837 --> 00:56.305
Yeah, public school is fine.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.174
- It's fine.
- Hm.

00:58.175 --> 01:01.143
I want the best for
little Gratitude.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.345
That's why we're applying to

01:02.346 --> 01:04.480
Little Doorways Academy
for Ethical Children.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.948
Little Doorways? Wut dat?

01:05.949 --> 01:08.784
Well, for one thing,
it's the only preschool in Manhattan

01:08.785 --> 01:10.253
that offers study abroad.

01:10.254 --> 01:12.088
And it's
the hardest to get into.

01:12.089 --> 01:15.391
Let's just say the waitlist
is Jay-Z's hundredth problem.

01:15.392 --> 01:17.727
Whoa, I love exclusive things.

01:17.728 --> 01:20.896
It's probably too late for
Leo to apply this year.

01:20.897 --> 01:22.198
But don't worry.
He's a bright kid.

01:22.199 --> 01:23.866
He'll land on his
feet somewhere.

01:23.867 --> 01:25.001
Damn right he's a bright kid,

01:25.002 --> 01:26.902
and he can get into
that fancy school easy.

01:26.903 --> 01:28.371
Everybody loves Leo.

01:28.372 --> 01:30.940
Doctor Lahiri, Leo needs to go.

01:30.941 --> 01:33.276
He keeps pinching
the other babies' butts.

01:33.277 --> 01:35.011
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.479
He gets that from me.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.748
We're not supposed to
do that in public, okay?

I went to that stupid music
class you recommended,

02:01.494 --> 02:02.561
and it was terrible.

02:02.562 --> 02:03.896
All the moms made me feel bad,

02:03.897 --> 02:05.431
and the teacher
publicly shamed me.

02:05.432 --> 02:08.100
Derek told me you shamed
yourself by not having PayPal.

02:08.101 --> 02:10.936
You wrote him a check

Three cheeseburgers,
extra shred lett.

02:19.746 --> 02:21.013
What does Dr. C think?

02:21.014 --> 02:22.481
Doesn't he want
Leo to go to like,

02:22.482 --> 02:25.017
the Immaculate Academy of
the Sacred Meatball or whatever?

02:25.018 --> 02:27.419
Danny would love him to go to
Catholic school, but no way.

02:27.420 --> 02:29.054
You've heard what those
priests do, right?

02:29.055 --> 02:31.490
- Yeah.
- They take a vow of poverty.

02:31.491 --> 02:32.991
I'm not going to
expose my son to that.

02:32.992 --> 02:34.359
Well, look,
if you do decide on prep school

02:34.360 --> 02:36.462
you'd better make
a move sharp-ish.

02:36.463 --> 02:38.430
I was already at Essex
at two months old.

02:38.431 --> 02:41.166

school that much better

02:46.739 --> 02:47.906
than public school?

02:47.907 --> 02:49.775
I went to public
school and I loved it.

02:49.776 --> 02:51.443
And watching that girl
give birth at prom

02:51.444 --> 02:53.412
is what made me want
to be an obstetrician.

02:53.413 --> 02:54.713
Don't worry, Dr. L.

02:54.714 --> 02:57.015
I went to public school
and I turned out great too.

Oh, by the way,
your 2:00 canceled.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.589
No, no, no... ah.

03:03.590 --> 03:05.157
- What?
- Okay, guys,

03:05.158 --> 03:07.560
I've got to get my son into
Little Doorways no matter what.

you're free tomorrow evening.

Anne-Marie's visiting
and she wants to take us to dinner.

03:14.167 --> 03:16.134
Whoa, Anne-Marie?

03:16.135 --> 03:19.137
The one you...
respect boundaries with?

03:19.138 --> 03:20.772
Listen, you're going to have
to take her out by yourself.

03:20.773 --> 03:22.908
I've got my bowling
championship tomorrow night.

03:22.909 --> 03:24.943
The Gutter Belles
are in the finals.

03:24.944 --> 03:25.978
I know!

03:25.979 --> 03:27.246
Are you kidding?

03:27.247 --> 03:29.548
Yeah, Ellen Page is doing
a documentary on us.

03:29.549 --> 03:32.618
I better go grease
up my finger-holes.

03:32.619 --> 03:35.454
- Hey, I'm really proud of you.
- Thank you.

03:35.455 --> 03:37.289
Isn't Anne-Marie
your sister-in-law

03:37.290 --> 03:38.690
who you slept with?

03:38.691 --> 03:39.958
You can't have dinner
with her by yourself.

03:39.959 --> 03:40.959
There's not enough
suspenders in the world

03:40.960 --> 03:42.294
to keep those pants up.

03:42.295 --> 03:43.729
Obviously Anne-Marie
cooked up this scheme

03:43.730 --> 03:45.364
so she could have
me all to herself.

03:45.365 --> 03:47.165
She won't be able to
keep her hands off me.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.800
We are like sexual dynamite.

03:48.801 --> 03:49.902
I can't hear about how women are

03:49.903 --> 03:51.370
sexually obsessed
with you anymore.

03:51.371 --> 03:53.405
I just know I cannot
resist this siren.

03:53.406 --> 03:55.274
I need someone to
tie me to the mast

03:55.275 --> 03:57.509
otherwise she will tempt
me and eat me alive.

03:57.510 --> 04:01.510
I need... a girlfriend.

04:02.215 --> 04:03.682
- No.
- Yes.

04:03.683 --> 04:06.718
No. I am tired of being used
to stop sex from happening.

04:06.719 --> 04:08.053
That's why the high
school principal

04:08.054 --> 04:09.988
made me room with the cool
kids on our trip to D.C.

04:09.989 --> 04:13.325
- But I need you.
- Jody, I can't.

04:13.326 --> 04:14.726
One, because I don't want to,

04:14.727 --> 04:16.827
two, because I have to
get my son into preschool.

04:16.829 --> 04:18.997
All right? And some of us
have more important things

04:18.998 --> 04:20.866
on our minds than sex.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.568
Who the hell ordered
a vibrating seat cushion

04:22.569 --> 04:24.269
with Oscar Isaac's face on it?

04:24.270 --> 04:26.205
That's mine,
put it in my office.

04:28.773 --> 04:30.943
Thank you so much.
Yeah, I'll make sure to wire you.

04:30.944 --> 04:32.044
Perfect.

04:32.045 --> 04:33.245
Catch you later, haters.

04:33.246 --> 04:35.447
Someone just bribed
a secretary at Little Doorways

04:35.448 --> 04:36.648
for an interview.

04:36.649 --> 04:38.150
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.

04:38.151 --> 04:39.952
Are you quite sure
you're fully prepared,

04:39.953 --> 04:41.386
because these
interviews can be tough.

04:41.387 --> 04:44.156
Yeah, I think I'm pretty
much gonna crush this.

04:44.157 --> 04:45.657
First of all,
I'm a female doctor, like,

04:45.658 --> 04:47.092
straight out of a sexist riddle.

04:47.093 --> 04:50.195
Second of all, I told them
that Danny was a little person,

04:50.196 --> 04:51.863
so they're gonna be touched.
We're golden.

04:51.864 --> 04:54.566
This is New York City, girl.
Everyone's story is impressive.

04:54.567 --> 04:57.269
My doorman used to be
the straight-up president of Greece.

04:57.270 --> 04:59.204
If it helps,
tell him you know me.

04:59.205 --> 05:02.207
Hey, guys, thank you
so much for all of your help,

05:02.208 --> 05:03.609
but I think I'll be fine

05:03.610 --> 05:06.178
because I still have
one card up my sleeve.

05:06.179 --> 05:08.046
The race card.

05:08.047 --> 05:10.549
Wait, what'd you say?

05:10.550 --> 05:12.384
Thank you for granting me
an interview so quickly.

05:12.385 --> 05:14.886
The gods surely must
be smiling on me today.

05:14.887 --> 05:16.455
You know,
I don't recall you having an accent

05:16.456 --> 05:17.656
when we spoke on the phone.

05:17.657 --> 05:19.825
Oh, God,
I didn't even notice it.

05:19.826 --> 05:22.694
That happens sometimes when
you're the child of immigrants.

05:22.695 --> 05:24.896
Well, as you know,
Little Doorways alums

05:24.897 --> 05:27.132
are exceptionally
high achievers.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.801
We've got some Rhodes
scholars and Nobel laureates,

05:29.802 --> 05:31.703
the talent Booker
for Jimmy Fallon.

05:31.704 --> 05:34.139
What? Are you kidding me?

05:34.140 --> 05:35.741
Okay, you know what?
I've heard enough.

05:35.742 --> 05:37.109
When can my son start?

05:37.110 --> 05:39.678
Oh, no, Dr. Lahiri.

05:39.679 --> 05:41.513
You're far from being accepted.

05:41.514 --> 05:43.682
We haven't even met
the child's father yet.

05:43.683 --> 05:47.683
Oh, um, I don't think
you're going to be able to.

05:48.121 --> 05:49.821
He's away for awhile.

05:49.822 --> 05:53.125
"Away for a little
while." I see.

05:53.126 --> 05:54.826
Yet another father
who's too busy

05:54.827 --> 05:57.462
to be involved in his
child's education.

05:57.463 --> 05:59.464
Perhaps you should try
something in Brooklyn.

05:59.465 --> 06:02.968
Oh, no, no, no.
Leo's dad is the over-involved one.

06:02.969 --> 06:04.369
I'm the checked-out parent.

06:04.370 --> 06:06.605
The other day I took home
the wrong kid from daycare.

06:06.606 --> 06:08.473
Please give my son a chance.

06:08.474 --> 06:11.476
Well, you do have another
chance to impress the committee.

06:11.477 --> 06:14.012
We're hosting a prospective
parents' night tomorrow.

06:14.013 --> 06:16.114
I strongly suggest you
bring Leo's father.

06:16.115 --> 06:17.849
But what if he won't
be back in time?

06:17.850 --> 06:19.651
He's across
the country taking care of

06:19.652 --> 06:21.219
a sick relative who he hates.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.288
We have a father who's
currently a prisoner of ISIS

06:23.289 --> 06:25.057
and he's planning
on coming tomorrow.

06:25.058 --> 06:26.191
You know what?

06:26.192 --> 06:27.292
We're definitely both
going to be there.

06:27.293 --> 06:30.630
So really excited.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.074

06:39.672 --> 06:41.039
Hey, cool guy.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.307
I need you to come to
an event with me tomorrow night

06:42.308 --> 06:44.009
and pretend to be Leo's father.

06:44.010 --> 06:46.278
Like a farce?
I love a good farce.

06:46.279 --> 06:48.113
Oh, yeah.

06:48.114 --> 06:50.082
At my university's
production of "Noises Off,"

06:50.083 --> 06:52.651
I played "Man
who passes out programs."

06:52.652 --> 06:54.619
I just need you to pretend
that you're married to me

06:54.620 --> 06:56.521
and help me charm
a very intimidating older woman

06:56.522 --> 06:58.557
into letting my son
into a fancy preschool.

06:58.558 --> 07:00.759
Hold on.
This is for Little Doorways?

07:00.760 --> 07:01.893
Oh, then I can't do it.

07:01.894 --> 07:04.029
That would be infidelity
to my Alma mater,

07:04.030 --> 07:08.030
The Essex School
for Unloved Boys.

07:09.435 --> 07:11.703
I couldn't help but eavesdrop.
I would love to be your date.

07:11.704 --> 07:14.673
I do an amazing Dr. C. Check it.

07:14.674 --> 07:17.442
Bongiorno,
my name is Dr. C.

07:17.443 --> 07:21.213
I hug and I kiss you.
Morgan is my best-a friend.

07:21.214 --> 07:24.015
- Stop, stop.
- Sorry.

07:24.016 --> 07:26.351
That sounds exactly like Danny.

07:26.352 --> 07:28.854
Honestly, you should be
on "Saturday Night Live."

07:28.855 --> 07:31.323
- Thank you.
- But you can't come with me.

07:31.324 --> 07:34.392
You look like a dirt bag
and you smell like medicine?

07:34.393 --> 07:37.563
No, propane. I...

07:39.599 --> 07:40.799
Oh, what about Derek and Lamork?

07:40.800 --> 07:42.634
He's going to
a concert this weekend.

07:42.635 --> 07:45.036
- Damn it.
- Oh, I got someone. Me!

07:45.037 --> 07:46.671
Beverly.

07:46.672 --> 07:49.608
Can't believe I'm asking you this,
but you're my last resort.

07:49.609 --> 07:51.276
Will you accompany me
on a date tomorrow?

07:51.277 --> 07:52.644
Oh, sorry,
I'm not supposed to date

07:52.645 --> 07:55.480
until I reach my tenth step.

07:55.481 --> 07:57.582
Mm, damn it, back to step one.

07:57.583 --> 07:58.850
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

07:58.851 --> 08:02.120
Jody, do you still
need a fake girlfriend

08:02.121 --> 08:04.356
because I need a fake husband.

08:04.357 --> 08:07.392
Well, well, well,
looking to strike a bargain

08:07.393 --> 08:08.927
with the devil, are we?

08:08.928 --> 08:10.629
Congratulations,
you are now married

08:10.630 --> 08:12.831
to the most handsome
man you've ever seen.

08:12.832 --> 08:14.032
That's untrue.

08:14.033 --> 08:15.467
I saw Bill O'Reilly at
the airport one time.

08:15.468 --> 08:18.837
But, yes, for one night only,
I will be your girlfriend,

08:18.838 --> 08:20.906
and you will be my husband.

08:20.907 --> 08:22.407
- Deal.
- Deal.

08:22.408 --> 08:23.408
I'll be Leo.

08:23.409 --> 08:24.529
- No, you can't come.
- Okay.

08:29.816 --> 08:32.350
Okay, now, please, do not say
anything racist or sexist.

08:32.351 --> 08:34.152
Or anything overly conservative.

08:34.153 --> 08:36.554
Oh, and I told them
that you were part Cherokee.

08:36.556 --> 08:38.423
Interesting fact,
the Kimball family

08:38.424 --> 08:41.159
actually escorted the Cherokee
on the Trail of Tears.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.693
Didn't even ask for payment.

08:42.695 --> 08:44.329
There was a real volunteer
spirit back then.

08:44.330 --> 08:45.864
Okay, listen, listen.

08:45.865 --> 08:48.834
For one night, can you just
pretend that you're not a jerk?

08:48.835 --> 08:50.335
Because honestly,
if you don't talk that much,

08:50.336 --> 08:52.237
people think
that you are handsome

08:52.238 --> 08:54.272
and that you are
maybe even charming.

08:54.273 --> 08:57.242
Just stick to non-controversial
topics like the weather.

08:57.243 --> 08:58.844
It is pretty cold out tonight.

08:58.845 --> 09:00.745
So much for so-called
global warming, eh?

09:00.746 --> 09:03.281
Damn it. This sucks.

09:03.282 --> 09:04.549
What are you doing?

09:04.550 --> 09:05.750
I would never fail to
take my wife's hand

09:05.751 --> 09:07.485
before entering
a social gathering.

09:07.486 --> 09:10.188
Oh, cool.

09:10.189 --> 09:12.524
So as you can see here
at Little Doorways,

09:12.525 --> 09:15.660
every moment of the school
day is expertly curated.

09:15.661 --> 09:18.530
Yesterday,
our students learned glass blowing

09:18.531 --> 09:21.700
before being treated to
a lecture by Elie Wiesel.

09:21.701 --> 09:23.568
Oh, my God, I love Elie Wiesel.

09:23.569 --> 09:26.071
Every night I read Leo her book.

09:26.072 --> 09:28.039
Um, he's a man.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.608
Okay, ladies, ladies.

09:29.609 --> 09:32.244
At this school,
we don't use gendered pronouns

09:32.245 --> 09:35.881
unless we've first issued
a trigger warning to "zheveryone."

09:38.584 --> 09:40.719
Ah, sí, sí.
Es bueno.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.520
- I have a question.
- Oh, God.

09:42.521 --> 09:45.624
I was wondering if any of
the ladies need a husband.

09:45.625 --> 09:46.625
What are you doing here?

09:46.626 --> 09:49.995
- Open house.
- Get out of here.

09:49.996 --> 09:53.498
I just want to say,
my husband and I

09:53.499 --> 09:55.533
were very impressed
with this open house.

09:55.534 --> 09:57.369
In fact,
we think this school's the tits.

09:57.370 --> 10:00.605
Well, yes, we're very proud of
our little school.

10:00.606 --> 10:02.707
We believe that creating
exceptional children

10:02.708 --> 10:04.743
starts with
exceptional facilities.

10:04.744 --> 10:07.646
Excuse me, ma'am,
but I beg to differ.

10:09.048 --> 10:11.349
Growing up a young
child in Georgia,

10:11.350 --> 10:14.152
I never had much in the way
of exceptional facilities.

10:14.153 --> 10:17.188
But I had everything I needed.
A loving mother and father.

10:17.189 --> 10:19.524
So at the end of the day,
I guess I don't care

10:19.525 --> 10:21.126
if my son goes to
Little Doorways.

10:21.127 --> 10:23.228
We so care. He's gone insane.

10:23.229 --> 10:24.729
Because to me,
exceptional children

10:24.730 --> 10:26.498
start with exceptional families.

10:26.499 --> 10:28.900
As long as I'm putting an apple
in his lunch sack every day

10:28.901 --> 10:30.168
and his mama's
reading him a story

10:30.169 --> 10:32.170
from the Good Book every night,

10:32.171 --> 10:34.072
I think little Leon's
going to be just fine.

10:34.073 --> 10:35.573
- Leo.
- Leo.

10:35.574 --> 10:38.710
You know, your wife was
so inarticulate before.

10:38.711 --> 10:41.379
You two seem like
an unlikely pair.

10:41.380 --> 10:43.915
Unlikely?
What, 'cause he's hot and tall?

10:43.916 --> 10:46.184
I'll have you know he is
so old that every night

10:46.185 --> 10:48.353
with me is basically statch.

10:48.354 --> 10:49.788
I'm like,
"Get off," and he's like, "No."

10:49.789 --> 10:52.090
Oh, don't mind my beloved Mindy.

10:52.091 --> 10:53.992
Please consider
that the female hormones

10:53.993 --> 10:55.060
that derange her thoughts

10:55.061 --> 10:57.028
also provide her with
a maternal instinct

10:57.029 --> 10:58.296
that'll bring
a tear to your eye.

11:00.066 --> 11:02.267
Why didn't you have
a speech prepared?

11:02.268 --> 11:03.635
You know, I don't know if it's

11:03.636 --> 11:06.171
the conflict-free
Shiraz talking,

11:06.172 --> 11:09.007
but I am going to
fast-track your application.

11:09.008 --> 11:10.342
Oh, my dear.

11:10.343 --> 11:12.410
I just need to pay a little
home visit, meet Leo.

11:12.411 --> 11:13.545
Are you free tomorrow morning?

11:13.546 --> 11:14.846
Oh, we're free anytime.
Seriously.

11:14.847 --> 11:17.115
I won't show up to work.
I'll quit my job.

11:17.116 --> 11:19.084
That's really not necessary.

11:19.085 --> 11:22.053
I want everyone to follow
me to the art room,

11:22.054 --> 11:23.455
but I have to warn you,

11:23.456 --> 11:27.292
Marina Abramovic
is nude in there.

11:28.327 --> 11:30.762
Ah!

11:30.763 --> 11:32.531
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

11:35.368 --> 11:37.702
Jody, I am very hard to impress.

11:37.703 --> 11:39.371
I gave The Louvre
one star on Yelp.

11:39.372 --> 11:41.506
But I was really moved by
what you said back there.

11:41.507 --> 11:43.575
I think you're
secretly a good guy.

11:43.576 --> 11:46.544
Good guy? I don't know.
Good ol' boy, sure.

11:46.545 --> 11:50.782
A gentleman, maybe.
Mr. Teen Georgia 1990, absolutely.

11:50.783 --> 11:53.351
No, really. I mean, like,
take this Anne-Marie situation.

11:53.352 --> 11:55.553
Old you would have done
something despicable,

11:55.554 --> 11:57.022
but new you is
trying to be good.

11:57.023 --> 11:59.090
Fine, I'm moral, whatever,

11:59.091 --> 12:01.793
but now I need you to focus
on making a good impression.

12:01.794 --> 12:03.094
Is this what you're wearing?

12:03.095 --> 12:04.562
I look like a hot witch, dude.

12:04.563 --> 12:06.798
The cashier at Barney's said,
quote,

12:06.799 --> 12:08.166
"Hey, it's your money, lady."

12:08.167 --> 12:09.200
She needs to believe
that you're someone

12:09.201 --> 12:10.435
I'd actually be interested in

12:10.436 --> 12:12.070
which is already
a bit of a stretch.

12:12.071 --> 12:14.271
That's a little insulting,
but what does it even matter?

12:15.948 --> 12:18.077
Come on, let's go knock 'em dead,
sweetheart.

12:19.678 --> 12:22.013
So, how'd y'all meet?

12:22.014 --> 12:24.649
Jody has never mentioned you.

12:24.650 --> 12:25.817
Oh, that's not
a very interesting story.

12:25.818 --> 12:27.218
Actually kind of a cute story.

12:27.219 --> 12:29.687
I was leaving the Met Ball
and I was with my girl squad,

12:29.688 --> 12:32.123
Solange Knowles
and George Clooney's hot wife,

12:32.124 --> 12:36.528
and we were accosted by
a drunk man asking for money.

12:36.529 --> 12:38.797
And that man, Jody.

12:38.798 --> 12:41.499
I don't think that's
exactly how it happened.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.967
You poor dear.

12:42.968 --> 12:44.669
It was sad as hell,

12:44.670 --> 12:47.372
and once I helped him curb
his excessive drinking

12:47.373 --> 12:48.840
and lifted him back on his feet,

12:48.841 --> 12:52.877
he helped me
overcome my anorexia.

12:52.878 --> 12:56.181
I know. It's kind of hard to
tell 'cause I'm still so slight,

12:56.182 --> 12:58.383
and then somewhere along
the way we fell in love.

12:58.384 --> 13:00.051
- Didn't we, baby?
- Yep.

13:00.052 --> 13:03.388
Hmm. I never thought Jody
could commit to one woman.

13:03.389 --> 13:05.423
There was a column in
our town paper called

13:05.424 --> 13:07.592
"Who's Jody Bedding?"

13:07.593 --> 13:10.261
When he moved away,
the writer was laid off.

13:10.262 --> 13:11.729
Oh.

13:11.730 --> 13:15.730
Well, that was before I met this
little dollop of brownie mix.

13:16.435 --> 13:18.536
Cupid's arrow's finally
pierced my heart.

13:18.537 --> 13:20.238
And his penis.

13:20.239 --> 13:21.840
Aren't you happy for us,
Anne-Marie?

13:21.841 --> 13:24.375
This is so nice.

13:24.376 --> 13:26.010
It's just a pity Colette
couldn't be here.

13:26.011 --> 13:28.513
I do miss her noogies so.

13:28.514 --> 13:30.582
I wish you'd picked
a night she was free.

13:30.583 --> 13:33.284
Wait, Jody was the one
that scheduled this night?

13:33.285 --> 13:36.488
He was insistent on tonight.

13:36.489 --> 13:37.755
Oh, God, my water and my ice!

13:37.756 --> 13:39.724
Oh! I'm so sorry.

13:39.725 --> 13:40.725
I'm going to go
help him clean up.

13:40.726 --> 13:42.160
Oh.

13:42.161 --> 13:44.529
We'll be right back, Anne-Marie.
I'm so sorry.

13:44.530 --> 13:46.397
Get over there.

13:46.398 --> 13:48.733
That wasn't a cock block.
I was the bait.

13:48.734 --> 13:49.834
I should have known
you were using me

13:49.835 --> 13:51.302
for how hot and sexy I am.

13:51.303 --> 13:54.305
Okay, I used you,
and I'm sorry, but it worked.

13:54.306 --> 13:55.607
Like that time
that I told you only men

13:55.608 --> 13:56.641
could clean the microwave

13:56.642 --> 13:58.343
and you insisted on
doing it yourself.

13:58.344 --> 14:00.345
You son of a bitch.

14:00.346 --> 14:01.913
I thought you had changed,

14:01.914 --> 14:03.848
but you're the same
old depraved pervert.

14:03.849 --> 14:07.785
Look, you owe me for getting
Leo into that fancy school.

14:07.786 --> 14:09.755
Fine. Whatever you say,
boyfriend.

14:12.691 --> 14:13.925
I'm sorry to report
that Mindy's feeling

14:13.926 --> 14:16.127
a little under the weather.
- Oh.

14:16.128 --> 14:17.629
She's going to go home
and have a lie down.

14:17.630 --> 14:19.564
Actually, I'm feeling a lot
better now that I threw up

14:19.565 --> 14:22.433
and I think we should
order some more appetizers.

14:22.434 --> 14:25.003
Oh, no, honey,
you're sick, remember?

14:25.004 --> 14:26.671
Oh, yes, you are burning up.

14:26.672 --> 14:29.607
I'm just... I'm just burning up
with my love for you, my sweet.

14:29.608 --> 14:31.209
What... what's going on here?

14:31.210 --> 14:34.913
Okay, okay. Okay. You got us.

14:34.914 --> 14:36.648
Mindy's not sick.

14:36.649 --> 14:40.251
The truth is,
I broke up with Mindy.

14:40.252 --> 14:42.854
- What?
- Just now in the bathroom?

14:42.855 --> 14:44.522
You did not break up with me.

14:44.523 --> 14:46.357
For the record, if anyone's
breaking up with anyone here,

14:46.358 --> 14:48.560
it's me dumping this
Southern Skeletor.

14:48.561 --> 14:52.664
Besides, he can't break up with
me because Jody gave me herpes.

14:52.665 --> 14:55.334
- Oh. Upstairs kind.
- And the downstairs kind.

15:00.446 --> 15:02.440
Mindy's not my girlfriend.

15:02.441 --> 15:05.310
I just brought her here to
try to make you jealous.

15:05.311 --> 15:09.147
Really? You went through
all this trouble for me?

15:09.148 --> 15:13.017
So who is she? Is she an escort?

15:13.018 --> 15:14.552
Exsqueeze me?

15:14.553 --> 15:17.021
That is the nicest thing anyone
has ever said to me. Thank you.

15:17.022 --> 15:18.523
Mindy, maybe you should go home.

15:18.524 --> 15:20.625
I think you've embarrassed
yourself enough for tonight.

15:20.626 --> 15:24.662
I'll go, but I just want
to say one thing to you.

15:24.663 --> 15:26.231
I saw a different
side of you tonight,

15:26.232 --> 15:27.332
and if that person is real

15:27.333 --> 15:29.634
then you deserve
a real chance at love.

15:29.635 --> 15:32.370
Not just to be someone's
secret side piece.

15:32.371 --> 15:33.871
Okay, excuse me.

15:33.872 --> 15:36.107
Can I just take this with
me because... it's fine,

15:36.108 --> 15:39.510
I'll bring back the basket tomorrow.
Good-bye.

15:39.511 --> 15:42.280
Ooh, should I order
us some more wine?

15:42.281 --> 15:45.116
Look, Jody,
I wanted to get you alone

15:45.117 --> 15:48.920
because I have something
very important to tell you.

15:48.921 --> 15:50.321
You're going to
leave my brother.

15:50.322 --> 15:52.056
Well, I can't help
but feel sorry for him,

15:52.057 --> 15:53.424
but he'll be all right.

15:53.425 --> 15:55.460
He's got his Iraq memories
to keep him company.

15:55.461 --> 15:57.161
I'm never leaving your brother.

15:57.162 --> 16:00.632
We have a life together.
I mean, we just got a pool.

16:00.633 --> 16:02.567
But our rolls in
the hay were so passionate.

16:02.568 --> 16:06.204
I recall once the pigs
actually applauded.

16:06.205 --> 16:07.939
You can't deny what
we had was real.

16:07.940 --> 16:10.308
Sure, I enjoyed it in the past,

16:10.309 --> 16:14.712
but it can never happen again.

16:14.713 --> 16:18.616
Like, a sitcom with
all-white characters.

16:18.617 --> 16:21.653
You're right. That's fine,
that's fine. I understand.

16:21.654 --> 16:23.921
Not like I was in love
with you or anything.

16:26.125 --> 16:29.294
You know, that disturbed
Middle Eastern prostitute

16:29.295 --> 16:30.728
was right.

16:30.729 --> 16:34.947
You deserve love, Jody.
Just not with me.

16:44.576 --> 16:46.177
♪ ♪

16:46.178 --> 16:48.813
Okay, Leo, when the woman from
the admissions office comes,

16:48.814 --> 16:50.315
I need you to look
like a hot nerd.

16:50.316 --> 16:52.550
You know, like Neil deGrasse
Tyson or Olivia Munn.

16:52.551 --> 16:55.119
Leo, are you reading
an entertainment magazine?

16:55.120 --> 16:57.021
Okay, honey, you gotta pretend
that you're not a total bimbo,

16:57.022 --> 16:58.022
okay?

16:59.158 --> 17:00.592
I'll be right there,
Mrs. Guterman.

17:03.162 --> 17:04.662
Hello, and...

17:04.663 --> 17:07.131
Well, good day my lovely wife.

17:07.132 --> 17:08.733
Oh, oh, God.

17:08.733 --> 17:10.468
I made it in time
for our appointment.

17:10.469 --> 17:14.038
Jody, what are you doing here?
Why aren't you with Anne-Marie?

17:14.039 --> 17:16.840
You wined and dined.
Did you not 69?

17:16.842 --> 17:19.176
No. Anne-Marie ended it,

17:19.178 --> 17:21.646
so I engaged in
a same-sex relationship

17:21.646 --> 17:23.781
with one Mr. Jack Daniels.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.215
I hate that you put it that way.

17:25.217 --> 17:27.018
Speaking of which,
did you know if you spend the night

17:27.019 --> 17:28.353
in Central Park,
you're considered a gay cruiser?

17:28.354 --> 17:29.754
Hmm.

17:29.755 --> 17:32.457
I thought I just met some
very friendly New Yorker fellow.

17:32.458 --> 17:35.626
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
You cannot sit...

17:35.627 --> 17:37.195
I don't have time
for this right now.

17:37.196 --> 17:38.963
Okay, the admissions director
is going to be here any second

17:38.964 --> 17:40.531
and I have to learn
all of current events.

17:40.532 --> 17:41.799
Like, did you know
that Bill Clinton's wife

17:41.800 --> 17:43.568
is running for president?
I didn't.

17:43.569 --> 17:45.536
The home visit is why I'm here.

17:45.537 --> 17:47.238
I make a promise, I keep it.

17:47.239 --> 17:49.941
When Jody Kimball-Kinney writes,
"See you this summer,"

17:49.942 --> 17:51.809
in your yearbook,
you shall be seen.

17:51.810 --> 17:54.345
That's cool,
but you're gross right now,

17:54.346 --> 17:56.247
and you're so drunk you
could accept a Golden Globe.

17:56.248 --> 17:58.015
You gotta go home.
I'm going to do this by myself.

18:00.018 --> 18:04.018
- She's here.
- Let's do this.

18:05.657 --> 18:08.559
Oh, my heart is broken,
to say nothing of the blue balls.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.161
Okay, take this off.
Just get in here, all right?

18:10.162 --> 18:13.464
Get in here and I will just
tell her that you are sick.

18:13.465 --> 18:15.433
Do not leave this room.

18:15.434 --> 18:18.603
Lord. Don't leave me.
I don't trust myself alone.

18:18.604 --> 18:20.171
What...
what if I take all these pills?

18:20.172 --> 18:21.773
Then you will relieve all
your menstrual cramps,

18:21.774 --> 18:24.140
- because that's Midol.
- God.

18:25.444 --> 18:28.980
Your Southern husband sure
does seem to love the Yankees.

18:28.981 --> 18:32.650
Oh. Those are actually mine.

18:32.651 --> 18:36.654
I'm a real sport-head.
Pfft. Whoa, nothing but net!

18:36.655 --> 18:40.655
And who is this little Italian man?
Is he a marionette?

18:41.126 --> 18:44.729
Oh, that is actually
the man that introduced me

18:44.730 --> 18:46.264
to my husband.

18:46.265 --> 18:47.532
You know,
when somebody introduces you

18:47.533 --> 18:49.467
to the love of your life
if you keep photos of them

18:49.468 --> 18:51.969
all around your house
as an homage...

18:51.970 --> 18:53.905
Yes, but I don't see any
photos of your husband.

18:53.906 --> 18:55.473
I mean, there's not one.

18:55.474 --> 18:58.976
And between the two of you, he's
the more classically photogenic.

18:58.977 --> 19:01.145
Okay, we're both super hot,
but you know,

19:01.146 --> 19:04.215
it's our tradition to not take
photos of ourselves together.

19:04.216 --> 19:06.884
You know, we prefer to
just live family moments.

19:06.885 --> 19:10.885
♪ Moon River,
wider than a mile ♪

19:11.623 --> 19:12.790
I didn't ' realize
your husband was home.

19:12.791 --> 19:15.460
♪ I'm crossing
you in style ♪

19:15.461 --> 19:17.429
Or that he's a countertenor.

19:19.622 --> 19:23.401
Oh, hello, lady from yesterday.

19:23.402 --> 19:24.836
Welcome to our home.

19:24.837 --> 19:27.004
Oh, it's so lovely
to see you again.

19:27.005 --> 19:28.906
I was just asking
Mindy some questions.

19:28.907 --> 19:32.959
That's funny, I was just
thinking of a question myself.

19:33.111 --> 19:34.445
Why?

19:34.446 --> 19:37.348
Oh, God.
Oh, you reek of bourbon.

19:37.349 --> 19:39.250
Oh, I'm not a drinker.

19:39.251 --> 19:41.152
I'm just going to talk to him
in the bathroom for a second.

19:41.153 --> 19:42.988
Come on, sweetheart.

19:44.456 --> 19:46.190
Oh.

19:46.191 --> 19:48.159
You need to chill out.
You are out of control.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.161
- That's so cold.
- What was that, huh?

19:50.162 --> 19:53.831
I'm drowning. Okay. Okay.

19:53.832 --> 19:57.401
Repeat after me.
I do not love Anne-Marie.

19:57.402 --> 20:01.739
I don't love Anne...
love Anne Marie.

20:01.740 --> 20:03.241
Wrong answer.

20:03.242 --> 20:05.243
Anne-Marie, I love you.

20:05.244 --> 20:08.346
All right. Hey, man,
you gotta pull it together.

20:08.347 --> 20:10.281
I met Anne-Marie.
She's not even that great.

20:10.282 --> 20:11.516
Her boobs are too big.

20:11.517 --> 20:13.518
She could have back
problems later in life.

20:13.519 --> 20:16.087
Just always looked
up to my brother.

20:16.088 --> 20:17.722
I practically wanted to be him,

20:17.723 --> 20:19.123
and he had this perfect,
gorgeous wife

20:19.124 --> 20:20.424
and I just...

20:20.425 --> 20:23.294
Wait, wait, is the only reason
that you like Anne-Marie

20:23.295 --> 20:24.929
because she's married
to your brother?

20:24.930 --> 20:27.265
Of course not.
We are soul mates.

20:27.266 --> 20:29.433
I think the jewelry
she makes is very interesting.

20:29.434 --> 20:33.137
Oh, my God.
You're in love with the idea of her.

20:33.138 --> 20:34.305
And the fact
that you can't have her

20:34.306 --> 20:36.641
just makes you want her more.

20:36.642 --> 20:38.242
Kind of like you
and that ritzy school?

20:38.243 --> 20:39.977
What? No.

20:39.978 --> 20:41.712
Just because the only
reason I'm doing any of this

20:41.713 --> 20:43.748
is to prove to those rich
moms that I'm as good as them

20:43.749 --> 20:47.018
does not mean that it's just
about me and those rich moms.

20:47.019 --> 20:48.586
Oh, boy.

20:48.587 --> 20:51.422
Well, it's clear what
we both have to do.

20:51.423 --> 20:53.057
Double down on
our impossible dreams.

20:53.058 --> 20:56.494
No, Jody.
We have to do the right thing.

20:56.495 --> 20:58.430
Damn it. Come on.

21:00.598 --> 21:02.433
Hey, Mrs. Guterman.

21:02.434 --> 21:03.834
I'm sorry we wasted your time,

21:03.835 --> 21:07.204
but I don't think
that Little Doorways is for us.

21:07.205 --> 21:09.740
I'm sorry, you're rejecting us?

21:09.741 --> 21:13.911
You must be joking.

21:13.912 --> 21:16.047
Kelly Ripa once offered
me one night of passion

21:16.048 --> 21:18.215
with Mark Consuelos for
a spot in our school.

21:18.216 --> 21:20.618
- Whoa.
- That's an offer I accepted.

21:20.619 --> 21:22.253
Mindy, I would do
that for you if you want.

21:22.254 --> 21:24.021
That's not necessary.

21:24.022 --> 21:26.657
I just... I think I want my son
to go to public school, you know?

21:26.658 --> 21:29.327
I went to public school
and I turned out...

21:29.328 --> 21:31.796
well, not great, but I'm fine.

21:31.797 --> 21:34.065
It's true, she's not
the fanciest schooner in the marina

21:34.066 --> 21:35.600
but she's a good little tugboat.

21:35.601 --> 21:37.268
He... I don't ' like
your metaphors for me.

21:37.269 --> 21:39.770
All right.
Just so you know, I was prepared

21:39.771 --> 21:41.273
to offer you a spot right now.

21:44.266 --> 21:45.576
Truly unique.

21:45.577 --> 21:48.646
Okay, well, out of curiosity,
how much is tuition?

21:48.647 --> 21:50.581
Pre-K starts at 70,000 a year.

21:50.582 --> 21:53.184
- $70,000?
- Mm-hmm.

21:53.185 --> 21:55.953
If I had $70,000 to blow,
I'd have a new face.

21:55.954 --> 21:59.522
Please lave. That's insane.

22:00.892 --> 22:04.328
Well, Leo, I think you might
go to school here one day.

22:04.329 --> 22:07.098
I know it's not Little Doorways,
but it doesn't matter.

22:07.099 --> 22:08.132
I'll be taking you
on so many auditions

22:08.133 --> 22:09.900
you'll barely even be here.

22:09.901 --> 22:11.502
- Hey, lady.
- Yeah?

22:11.503 --> 22:13.337
Give us your extensions
or I'll beat your ass.

22:13.338 --> 22:14.939
My hair's all real!
Don't hurt me!

22:14.940 --> 22:16.540
Run, Leo, you might have
to do Catholic school.
