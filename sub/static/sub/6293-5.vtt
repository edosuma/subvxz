ON UNITED STATES OF TARA...

00:12.580 --> 00:14.448
I HAVEN'T HAD
A REAL FRIEND IN SO LONG.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.784
TIFFANY MUST BE VERY PLEASED
WITH YOUR WORK.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.186
I LOVE IT.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.054
GOD, I JUST WANT
TO LIVE IN THERE, RIGHT?

00:20.088 --> 00:21.622
HI, I'M THE NEW SERVER.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.094
GENE STUART,
GENERAL MANAGER.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.462
I THINK HE'S NICE.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.797
IF YOU LIKE HIM,
HE MUST BE A GREAT GUY.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.399
AND IF HE LIKES YOU,
THEN HE WON'T

00:31.432 --> 00:32.500
GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT THE BEE STINGS.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.635
DOES THAT HURT?

00:34.668 --> 00:36.337
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.438
THANK YOU.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.548
I KNOW ABOUT
THE MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.683
I WANT TO MEET ONE.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.519
TIFFANY, YOU DON'T.
I'M NOT A DANCING MONKEY.

TIFFANY THINKS

TUPAC IS ALIVE.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.702
I JUST SAW HIM
EATING HUEVOS

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:18.672 --> 02:19.940
OH, YES, I DID.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.210

I COULD FIND SOME KIND OF CLUE

02:25.213 --> 02:27.348
NOW LOOKITY-LOOK WHO'S DEAD.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.949
NOW WOULD BE YOUR WINDOW
TO SAY SOMETHING DISPARAGING

02:28.982 --> 02:33.287
ABOUT ME BEING VERY NANCY DREW
OR MRS. MARPLE-ESQUE.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.655
IT'S TOO EARLY.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.923
TARA MADE A NEW FRIEND.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.958
TIFFANY WAS A THREAT
TO THE SYSTEM.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.428
SO ONE OF THE ALTERS
WAS JEALOUS?

02:40.461 --> 02:42.696
AND WANTED TO BE
OUT IN THE WORLD TOO.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.933
I KNOW THIS IS SCARY,
BUT IT'S WHAT WE WANTED.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.968
NOT TO JUST
TOLERATE YOUR PARTS,

02:48.001 --> 02:49.837
BUT TO REALLY
GET TO KNOW THEM.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.806
SO THAT WE'LL GET TO THE TRUTH
OF WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.575
IT'S JUST ONE
OF YOUR ALTERS SHOWING

02:54.608 --> 02:55.776

02:55.809 --> 02:58.446

TO SCRATCH

WHICH IS TOTALLY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.748
WE'RE NOT ENCOURAGED
TO EXPRESS IT,

BE ENOUGH.

WHEN PEOPLE SEE
WHO I REALLY AM,

04:03.311 --> 04:05.713
IT'S GONNA
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.981
I CAN'T IMAGINE ALICE
SCRATCHING UP SOMEBODY'S WALL.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.750
NO WAY.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.485
I GUESS IT COULD BE BUCK.

ON T.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.438
WE KNOW SHE'S INSECURE.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.373
SO WHEN YOU SEE
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF,

04:32.406 --> 04:33.707
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW

ALICE MAKING

04:52.693 --> 04:54.027

04:54.061 --> 04:55.563
BUT WHEN YOU
OR ONE OF THE KIDS TELL ME,

04:55.596 --> 04:57.565
I CAN FEEL IT'S TRUE.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.567

IN ANOTHER ROOM IN MY HEAD

I CAN SEE IT
KIND OF CLICK WITH YOU.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.472
YEAH, BUT WITH THIS,
THERE'S NO CLICK.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.039
I HAVE NO FEELING
FOR IT.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.741
AND I WOULD
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, HONESTLY.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.077
BUT I JUST
DON'T THINK IT WAS ME.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.745

05:11.779 --> 05:14.081
MAYBE IT WAS

THERE'S SOME WAY.

YOU DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

WELL, I ASKED,
BUT I THINK MY WANTING TO KNOW

08:01.649 --> 08:03.250
JUST PUTS HER ON EDGE.

YEAH, I KNOW.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.153
OH, YOU KNOW?

21:23.683 --> 21:27.587
WITHOUT EVEN CARING,
BUT I WON'T GO THERE, KATIE,

21:27.620 --> 21:29.756
ESPECIALLY NOT WITH SOMEONE

21:34.661 --> 21:36.829
HERE'S MY HOUSE.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.598
OH, THAT'S YOUR HOUSE?

21:38.631 --> 21:40.099

22:28.014 --> 22:29.549
THANK GOD YOU'RE SAFE, KATIE.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.150
WE WERE WORRIED

22:31.183 --> 22:32.485
KATIE CAN TAKE CARE
OF HERSELF.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.953

22:33.986 --> 22:35.121

23:10.590 --> 23:11.558
WHY DOES EVERYONE

23:11.591 --> 23:12.725
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS YOU.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.495

23:15.528 --> 23:16.829
