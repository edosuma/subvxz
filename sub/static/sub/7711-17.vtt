WEBVTT

00:01.971 --> 00:05.178
Can you confirm
that the straps are tight?

00:05.212 --> 00:06.446
[groaning]
Yes.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.684
But this one's a little...

00:08.717 --> 00:12.192
And now the chains!

00:12.225 --> 00:13.794
A lot of people think
that magic camp

00:13.828 --> 00:15.464
is just for kids.

00:15.499 --> 00:16.300
And that's why so many

00:16.334 --> 00:17.802
other people
in my class were kids.

00:17.836 --> 00:19.773
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:19.806 --> 00:23.581
It's, um, really
for anybody

00:23.615 --> 00:27.123
with a dream,
and a belief in magic,

00:27.156 --> 00:30.261
and a little extra time
after school.

00:30.295 --> 00:34.270
[whispering, echoing himself]
Magic, magic, magic, magic...

00:34.302 --> 00:36.540
[loudly]
And now, Michael the Magic

00:36.574 --> 00:40.314
will attempt to escape
from extreme bondage.

00:40.349 --> 00:41.316
[snorts]

00:41.351 --> 00:42.318
Can he do it?

00:42.353 --> 00:44.157
I don't see how he can.

00:44.190 --> 00:45.192
I know how.

00:45.225 --> 00:47.229
He'd dislocate his shoulder
and slip his arm out.

00:47.263 --> 00:49.332
No! No.

00:49.367 --> 00:52.206
Everyone now count down
with me.

00:52.239 --> 00:52.838
Three!
Sorry.

00:52.873 --> 00:54.277
Sorry, quickly.

00:54.310 --> 00:56.446
So is it true
that if you can't get out,

00:56.480 --> 00:58.151
you don't want anyone
to help you?

00:58.185 --> 00:59.153
I will get out.

00:59.187 --> 01:01.557
Oh, yes, I will.

01:01.591 --> 01:03.828
So we shouldn't help you,
no matter how much

01:03.861 --> 01:04.763
you might beg and plead.

01:04.796 --> 01:06.467
No, all right, just--
this is getting hot.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.237
So let's just do this,
okay, ready?

01:08.270 --> 01:09.373
Three!

01:09.406 --> 01:10.542
(all)
Two.

01:10.574 --> 01:11.544
One!

01:11.576 --> 01:13.147
Go!

01:35.759 --> 01:37.396
Mm-hmm.

01:37.428 --> 01:39.400
[groaning]

01:39.432 --> 01:40.902
Aah!

01:40.934 --> 01:42.873
Is everything okay,
Michael?

01:42.906 --> 01:45.279
Yes.

01:45.312 --> 01:50.019
(Michael)
I cannot tell you
how I plan to escape.

01:50.052 --> 01:52.726
Other than by using magic.

01:52.759 --> 01:55.598
That is the magician's code.

01:56.934 --> 01:58.871
[groaning]
Help.

01:58.905 --> 02:00.241
Separately,
on an unrelated note,

02:00.241 --> 02:05.285
if you happen to find
a small brass key...

02:05.319 --> 02:08.290
[cheerful music]

02:08.325 --> 02:16.341
*

02:25.859 --> 02:28.764
All right, ready?

02:28.798 --> 02:31.503
Come on, guys,
early worm gets the worm.

02:31.537 --> 02:33.073
Another worm?

02:33.105 --> 02:33.841
Like, are they friends?

02:33.875 --> 02:35.479
It's early bird
gets the worm.

02:35.512 --> 02:36.481
Okay.

02:36.514 --> 02:38.016
[breathes on fingers]

02:38.048 --> 02:39.552
Pam, would you smell
my breath?

02:39.587 --> 02:40.621
No. No.

02:40.654 --> 02:42.625
(Dwight)
Let me smell.

02:42.658 --> 02:45.899
[exhales loudly]

02:45.932 --> 02:47.469
Good, not great.

02:47.503 --> 02:48.570
Michael, you go to parties
all the time.

02:48.605 --> 02:49.806
Why is tonight
so special?

02:49.840 --> 02:54.080
Well, tonight is so special
because my boss's boss's boss,

02:54.115 --> 02:56.987
the CFO, not his initials,
common mistake,

02:57.021 --> 02:59.592
is having a little shindig
for all the managers

02:59.627 --> 03:02.733
in the company, and Jan and I
are going as a couple.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.570
For the first time.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.641
So it's kind of
our coming out party.

03:06.673 --> 03:07.808
Really.

03:07.842 --> 03:10.514
And that is why tonight
is so special.

03:10.548 --> 03:12.117
Jimbo, last chance
carpool.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.621
Oh, no thanks, I think
Karen and I'll take my car.

03:13.654 --> 03:14.690
Sure? Might be a good idea.

03:14.723 --> 03:16.793
If we all went together
we could save some gas.

03:16.826 --> 03:18.028
Have fun. Long trip!
Thanks.

03:18.063 --> 03:19.500
Play some games?
Oh.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.471
Um...no, we're good.

03:21.504 --> 03:22.672
I Spy.
Yeah.

03:22.706 --> 03:25.042
Why don't I wanna go?

03:25.077 --> 03:26.546
Didn't expect to need
a reason,

03:26.581 --> 03:27.548
so let me think here.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.550
Um...

03:28.585 --> 03:29.920
[clears throat]

03:29.953 --> 03:31.022
I don't know
any of these people.

03:31.054 --> 03:32.658
It's an obligation.

03:32.693 --> 03:35.097
I don't like talking paper
in my free time.

03:35.130 --> 03:36.666
[softly]
Or in my work time.

03:36.701 --> 03:40.542
And...did I use
the word "pointless?"

03:40.575 --> 03:42.979
Thanks for inviting me along.

03:43.013 --> 03:44.115
Oh, sure.

03:44.148 --> 03:45.552
Really didn't give it
any thought.

03:45.585 --> 03:47.221
Wait, should you
be going?

03:47.254 --> 03:49.727
[cell phone ringing]

03:49.759 --> 03:51.564
Hey-wo, you!

03:51.597 --> 03:52.966
(Jan)
Michael?
Hey, buttercup.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.037
I am on my way,
should be there in about 15--

03:55.070 --> 03:56.940
Let's just blow
this party off.

03:56.974 --> 03:58.176
That's what she said.
Yeah.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.113
Am I on speaker phone?

04:00.147 --> 04:02.217
Ah, yes you are.

04:02.251 --> 04:04.221
Is anybody else--
Hello, Jan!

04:04.255 --> 04:05.222
Hi, Dwight.

04:05.258 --> 04:07.061
Okay, Michael,
take me off speakerphone.

04:07.093 --> 04:08.865
No le problem.

04:08.898 --> 04:10.768
[beeps]

04:10.802 --> 04:12.136
Okay, let's just go
to a motel--

04:12.170 --> 04:13.205
Okay!

04:13.239 --> 04:14.609
And, like, rip
into each other

04:14.642 --> 04:16.012
like we did
on that black sand beach

04:16.044 --> 04:17.114
in Jamaica.

04:17.146 --> 04:18.215
Hey, Jan?

04:18.249 --> 04:21.255
Jan, this party is actually
a very big step for us.

04:21.289 --> 04:23.660
So I--
Still on speaker?

04:23.695 --> 04:26.767
Um...I don't know.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.036
Are cameras there?

04:28.069 --> 04:29.138
Maybe.

04:29.170 --> 04:30.941
All right,
see you soon.

04:30.974 --> 04:32.111
Okay.
Talk to you later, Jan!

04:32.144 --> 04:34.181
All right, bye.

04:34.215 --> 04:35.150
(Pam)
Hey, Michael left early,

04:35.183 --> 04:37.221
so a bunch of us
are gonna go to Poor Richard's

04:37.254 --> 04:38.725
for happy hour,
you should come.

04:38.758 --> 04:41.062
I can't.

04:41.095 --> 04:43.233
My brother just unloaded
the Jet Skis

04:43.266 --> 04:45.639
and he kinda took a bath,
so...

04:45.672 --> 04:47.174
We're gonna go
get hammered.

04:47.207 --> 04:49.780
Okay, well, we're going
to a bar.

04:52.952 --> 04:54.155
Hey.

04:54.188 --> 04:56.125
You have to come
to stuff with me.

04:56.159 --> 04:58.263
I'm serious.

04:58.296 --> 04:58.997
If you're gonna be
my boyfriend,

04:59.030 --> 05:00.601
you have to do
boyfriend things.

05:00.601 --> 05:05.311
Okay.

05:05.343 --> 05:09.250
I have decided that
I'm going to be more honest.

05:09.284 --> 05:12.825
I'm gonna start telling people
what I want directly.

05:12.859 --> 05:16.132
So look out world,
'cause ol' Pamie

05:16.164 --> 05:18.303
is getting what she wants.

05:18.336 --> 05:20.307
And don't call me Pamie.

05:20.340 --> 05:22.177
Beauty.

05:22.211 --> 05:24.215
Thank you, sir.

05:24.248 --> 05:25.918
Ensalada.
Thank you.

05:29.090 --> 05:31.162
You're dressed
exactly like the servants.

05:31.195 --> 05:32.898
Shut up.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.000
Okay, change shirts
with me.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.403
What?
Give me your shirt.

05:35.438 --> 05:37.207
No, but yours
won't fit me.

05:37.241 --> 05:38.778
I don't care.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.288
This is stupid.

05:44.321 --> 05:47.126
Ah...wow.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.366
Here.

05:49.399 --> 05:50.934
Don't let my jacket--

05:50.969 --> 05:52.806
Don't give me that.

05:52.839 --> 05:54.877
That would have been
really embarrassing.

05:54.910 --> 05:55.979
Yes.

05:56.011 --> 05:56.981
Crisis averted.

05:57.013 --> 05:58.148
Okay.

05:58.182 --> 06:00.721
[Wild Cherry's
Play That Funky Music]

06:00.721 --> 06:03.828
* Yeah, hey

06:03.861 --> 06:04.930
(Pam)
Oh.

06:04.962 --> 06:06.198
That duck is so cute.

06:06.232 --> 06:10.339
* Yeah, once I was
a boogie singer *

Hey, Pam.

in a rock and roll band *

Angela.

06:15.150 --> 06:18.825
Uh, hi!

06:18.858 --> 06:22.163
Actually, it's polite
to arrive early.

06:22.196 --> 06:24.068
And smart.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.339
Only really good friends
show up early.

06:26.372 --> 06:28.845
Ergo de facto,
go to a party early,

06:28.878 --> 06:31.082
become a really good friend.

06:31.114 --> 06:32.351
Oh! Uh, potato salad.

06:32.384 --> 06:33.353
Oh.
That's from both of us.

06:33.386 --> 06:34.355
No, it's not.

06:34.388 --> 06:36.392
It's my bowl.
Wonderful.

06:36.426 --> 06:39.398
Let's, uh, see
where we can put this.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.201
Okay.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.036
Oh, you know what,
you probably wanna leave

06:42.071 --> 06:44.240
the cover on
until the guests get here.

06:44.274 --> 06:48.115
[whispering]
It's been sitting
in my car all day.

06:48.148 --> 06:50.020
Sun beating down
on the mayonnaise...

06:50.052 --> 06:55.062
Just...you never know.

06:55.097 --> 06:57.535
Kevin, you and Stacey
set a date yet?

06:57.567 --> 06:58.871
Yeah.

06:58.905 --> 07:00.340
Oh, my God,
when is it?

07:00.373 --> 07:03.346
It's complicated.

07:03.378 --> 07:05.951
I would appreciate
some space on this.

07:05.985 --> 07:07.387
(Roy)
Hey!

07:07.421 --> 07:09.057
Hey!

07:09.091 --> 07:10.427
You made it.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.331
Yeah, you said
it was important, so...

07:12.364 --> 07:14.300
It is.

07:14.335 --> 07:15.470
How's it going?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.374
What's up, Pam?
Hey, Kenny.

07:17.407 --> 07:19.144
Sorry about the Jet Skis.

07:19.178 --> 07:21.115
[clears throat]

07:21.148 --> 07:22.517
You guys all want
a round? On me?

07:22.552 --> 07:23.988
(all)
Yeah!

07:24.020 --> 07:25.022
Let's get you
a drink.

07:25.057 --> 07:26.392
Thanks, man.
I'm thirsty.

07:26.425 --> 07:27.628
(Angela)
No, thank you, Roy, I...

07:27.661 --> 07:30.634
(Kelly)
You should get a round, Ryan.

07:30.667 --> 07:35.309
Oh, you know that line
on the top of the shrimp?

07:35.342 --> 07:39.317
That's feces.

07:39.350 --> 07:40.319
Whatcha looking for?

07:40.352 --> 07:41.354
Did you bring dip?

07:41.388 --> 07:44.028
I'm sure
that it's catered.

07:44.061 --> 07:46.331
I need you
to sign these, Michael.

07:46.364 --> 07:48.504
That's a waiver
of some of your rights.

07:48.537 --> 07:50.440
You should read it carefully.

07:50.474 --> 07:52.077
It releases the company
in the event

07:52.111 --> 07:53.514
that our relationship
in your opinion,

07:53.547 --> 07:55.349
or in reality,
interferes with work.

07:55.382 --> 07:59.158
You get a copy, I get a copy,
and a third copy goes to HR.

07:59.190 --> 08:00.561
Awesome.

08:00.594 --> 08:02.665
I'm gonna frame mine.

08:02.698 --> 08:03.633
I could frame yours too.

08:03.667 --> 08:06.305
You realize this is--
this is a legal document

08:06.339 --> 08:08.309
that says you can't sue
the company?

08:08.343 --> 08:11.114
Over our love.

08:11.148 --> 08:14.556
I've...never told you
that I love you.

08:14.588 --> 08:16.359
You don't have to, Jan.

08:16.392 --> 08:18.496
This contract
says it all.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.201
(Jan)
I am taking a calculated risk.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.436
What's the upside?

08:22.470 --> 08:24.542
I overcome my nausea,
fall deeply in love,

08:24.576 --> 08:27.181
babies, normalcy,
no more self-loathing.

08:27.213 --> 08:31.454
Downside, I, uh,
date Michael Scott publicly

08:31.488 --> 08:34.061
and collapse into myself
like a dying star.

08:34.095 --> 08:36.398
[papers rattling]

08:36.431 --> 08:38.169
What's this over the I?

08:38.203 --> 08:41.242
It's a heart.

08:41.274 --> 08:45.349
Why is this so hard?

08:45.382 --> 08:48.488
That's what she said.

08:48.522 --> 08:50.526
Oh, my God.
What am I saying?

08:50.561 --> 08:52.698
[shouting]
I love this woman!

08:52.732 --> 08:54.769
Oh, no, Michael,
please, Michael, please.

08:54.801 --> 09:07.795
Come on.

09:07.827 --> 09:08.797
Do you ever watch
Battlestar Galactica?

09:08.829 --> 09:09.865
No.
No?

09:09.899 --> 09:11.402
Then you're an idiot.

09:11.435 --> 09:12.236
Hello, Michael.

09:12.270 --> 09:15.611
Rachel, boy,
do you clean up good.

09:15.643 --> 09:18.248
Place looks great
with all the lights on.

09:18.283 --> 09:19.686
And everything
actually looks bigger

09:19.719 --> 09:21.189
with people in it,
weird.

09:21.222 --> 09:24.629
Jan, glad you could
make it.

09:24.662 --> 09:26.398
Oh, of course,
of course, David.

09:26.432 --> 09:27.767
Do you remember, uh,
Michael Scott?

09:27.802 --> 09:29.270
Of course I do.
From Scranton branch.

09:29.305 --> 09:30.272
How are you, Michael?

09:30.307 --> 09:31.676
Jan and I are lovers.

09:31.710 --> 09:33.879
That feels so good
to finally say that out loud.

09:33.914 --> 09:37.287
David, can I, um,
speak to you privately

09:37.321 --> 09:39.358
for just a moment, please?

09:39.390 --> 09:40.459
Excuse me.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.563
Okay.

09:45.469 --> 09:47.374
Oh.

09:50.011 --> 09:53.820
No. Actually, one of these
is supposed to be a light.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.457
Oh, sorry.

09:57.526 --> 09:59.597
So the merger goes smoothly,
or...

09:59.631 --> 10:01.201
It did.
"Like butter."

10:01.201 --> 10:03.339
Mike Myers, SNL.

10:03.372 --> 10:04.975
You should ask Karen,
she was one of them.

10:05.008 --> 10:06.444
Yeah, I'm
the only one left.

10:06.479 --> 10:09.016
Everybody else
was either fired or quit.

10:09.050 --> 10:10.753
And there's one
in anger management.

10:10.788 --> 10:12.757
Yeah, but you're great now,
right?

10:12.792 --> 10:14.962
We're all great.

10:14.995 --> 10:16.431
Aren't we great?

10:16.465 --> 10:17.934
We're good.

10:17.968 --> 10:21.007
Michael, st--
please stop that, okay?

10:21.041 --> 10:21.875
Uh, can I get anyone
anything?

10:21.910 --> 10:23.980
I could go
for an appe-tease-er, yep.

10:24.013 --> 10:25.717
Martini, please.
Bagel bites or something.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.621
Rachel, your house
is beautiful.

10:27.654 --> 10:28.623
Oh, thank you.

10:28.656 --> 10:29.625
What's the square footage?

10:29.658 --> 10:31.329
[softly]
Wow.

10:31.362 --> 10:33.065
Uh, about 5,000.

10:33.097 --> 10:34.500
Does that include
the garage?

10:34.535 --> 10:37.741
Dwight,
that's not appropriate.

10:37.775 --> 10:39.510
I don't know.
It's a common question.

10:39.545 --> 10:41.415
David, how much
did this house cost?

10:41.449 --> 10:42.484
[spit take]

10:42.516 --> 10:45.924
These old colonials
are great...when they're sound.

10:45.958 --> 10:48.094
I'd love to, uh,
take a look around.

10:48.127 --> 10:50.066
I'll show you around,
sure.

10:50.098 --> 10:51.769
Cool, let's start
with the banisters.

10:51.803 --> 10:53.506
Hey.

10:53.538 --> 10:55.443
Do you see that guy
behind you

10:55.477 --> 10:58.349
in the blue blazer
against the wall?

10:58.383 --> 10:59.385
Mm, yup.

10:59.418 --> 11:01.021
That's Drake.

11:01.053 --> 11:03.125
And just so you know,
I don't wanna be weird

11:03.158 --> 11:06.130
or anything, but, um,
we used to date.

11:06.164 --> 11:08.001
Oh.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.806
Okay, cool.
Thanks for telling me that.

11:09.839 --> 11:11.074
And it didn't end well.

11:11.107 --> 11:13.847
Gotcha.

11:13.879 --> 11:15.851
All right.

11:19.624 --> 11:21.795
This was a gift...

11:21.829 --> 11:24.401
from Lee Iacocca.

11:24.435 --> 11:27.106
20-year-old,
single malt Scotch.

11:27.139 --> 11:30.881
Here is to Mr. Iacocca
and his failed experiment,

11:30.914 --> 11:32.952
the DeLorean.

11:34.755 --> 11:36.624
[coughing]

11:36.659 --> 11:38.194
Are you okay?

11:38.227 --> 11:39.097
[choking]
Yeah!

11:39.129 --> 11:40.198
Do you have any ice?

11:40.231 --> 11:41.200
[coughing]

11:41.233 --> 11:43.439
Sure.

11:43.473 --> 11:44.976
How about some Splenda?

11:45.009 --> 11:46.479
[coughs]

11:46.512 --> 11:49.149
1, 2, 3,
up chickens!

11:49.184 --> 11:50.954
(Roy)
Down chickens!

11:50.988 --> 11:51.956
Uh, I think I heard
the quarter over here.

11:51.990 --> 11:52.925
Where?
On this side.

11:52.958 --> 11:55.228
No, it is definitely
under one of these hands.

11:55.261 --> 11:56.699
I kind of heard it
on Roy's side too.

11:56.732 --> 11:58.469
No, it is here.

11:58.503 --> 11:59.871
Not here.

11:59.905 --> 12:01.173
Not here. Not here.

12:01.208 --> 12:03.112
Not here.

12:03.145 --> 12:04.714
Good thing you didn't listen
to me.

12:04.748 --> 12:05.851
Yeah, close one.

12:05.883 --> 12:08.923
(Roy)
Not here. Not here.

12:08.957 --> 12:10.492
Okay, it's either here
or here.

12:15.737 --> 12:16.940
Not here.

12:16.973 --> 12:18.543
[cheers and applause]

12:18.576 --> 12:19.578
Yes!

12:19.610 --> 12:20.612
Nice job.

12:20.647 --> 12:22.216
I can read you
like a book.

12:22.249 --> 12:23.251
Oh, yeah?

12:23.285 --> 12:24.755
You can't keep anything
from me.

12:24.789 --> 12:26.624
[laughter]

12:26.659 --> 12:27.894
Bottom's up.

12:27.927 --> 12:29.765
Hey, Creed.
Hey.

12:29.799 --> 12:30.767
What's up, Creed?

12:30.801 --> 12:31.835
What are you guys
up to?

12:31.870 --> 12:33.906
Ah, hello.

12:33.939 --> 12:35.142
You're the man,
buddy.

12:35.176 --> 12:38.616
I run a small fake ID company
from my car

12:38.649 --> 12:40.752
with a laminating machine
that I swiped

12:40.788 --> 12:42.290
from the sheriff's station.

12:45.129 --> 12:46.164
Huh, yeah.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.302
These studs
are way too far apart.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.705
[laughs softly]

12:49.738 --> 12:50.973
[sighs]

12:51.007 --> 12:52.577
What's in here?

12:52.611 --> 12:53.979
Ah, it's a guest room.

12:54.013 --> 12:56.184
Just the one window?

12:56.218 --> 12:57.654
[phone rings]

12:57.687 --> 12:58.723
Oh, I must get that.

12:58.756 --> 12:59.891
You'll have to excuse me.

12:59.925 --> 13:01.061
Are those real pearls?

13:01.094 --> 13:01.561
Uh, yes.

13:01.561 --> 13:03.298
They're...
[phone rings]

13:03.331 --> 13:05.269
[sighs]

13:05.302 --> 13:08.910
Yes.

13:08.944 --> 13:12.249
[alarm beeping]

13:13.418 --> 13:14.787
Good.

13:14.822 --> 13:16.391
Well, it was nice
meeting you guys.

13:16.424 --> 13:19.197
Take care.

13:19.229 --> 13:21.903
Well, if you're wondering why
his wife was staring daggers

13:21.935 --> 13:23.405
at me, it's because
I kinda saw him

13:23.437 --> 13:25.142
for a little bit
when they were separated.

13:25.176 --> 13:26.945
Oh.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.247
Didn't notice.

13:28.282 --> 13:30.318
Really? I thought
it was so obvious.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.389
I'm glad it didn't make you
uncomfortable.

13:32.423 --> 13:33.993
No, it was
before I knew you,

13:34.026 --> 13:35.428
so...it's fine.

13:35.461 --> 13:38.434
Wow, this one really smells
like vanilla.

13:38.467 --> 13:39.436
Mm.
Check that out.

13:39.469 --> 13:40.438
That's nice.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.912
You and the Mrs.
should join us

13:42.944 --> 13:45.216
at Sandals Jamaica
next Christmas.

13:45.249 --> 13:48.255
I...Michael, I think
David probably wants

13:48.288 --> 13:49.926
to spend Christmas here
with his family.

13:49.958 --> 13:51.060
Oh, yeah.

13:51.093 --> 13:53.064
They don't allow kids
at Sandals.

13:53.097 --> 13:55.903
They are--are
persona non grata.

13:55.938 --> 13:57.206
[softly]
Please stop.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.944
They're...uh,
but it's fun.

13:58.976 --> 14:00.011
It is an awesome place.

14:00.045 --> 14:01.681
You would not believe
how low this girl can limbo.

14:01.681 --> 14:03.920
[sighs]
David, I'm sorry.

14:03.953 --> 14:05.121
You're just gonna
have to excuse us

14:05.156 --> 14:06.490
for just a couple minutes,
sorry.

14:06.524 --> 14:08.161
Okay, okay.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.330
Excuse me.

14:09.363 --> 14:10.934
(Michael)
What's going on?

14:10.967 --> 14:12.203
What is it?

14:12.235 --> 14:13.272
Sorry.

14:13.304 --> 14:16.377
What--what's the matter?

14:16.410 --> 14:18.515
What's--
Come here.

14:18.547 --> 14:22.489
Just--just--just--just...

14:24.995 --> 14:26.363
[laughter]

14:26.398 --> 14:27.132
What are you doing?

14:27.165 --> 14:29.037
Don't you know
what I'm doing?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.173
Yes, but you
could tell me.

14:31.207 --> 14:33.345
[laughing]
What are--what is that?

14:33.377 --> 14:35.416
Why are you--why are we going
in the bathroom?

14:35.449 --> 14:37.453
I thought this is where
you liked your privacy.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.890
Shut up.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.418
(Michael)
What has gotten into you?

14:53.452 --> 14:54.586
No, no, no, no!
What?

14:54.619 --> 14:56.190
Come on, let's go back
to the party.

14:56.223 --> 14:57.894
Come on, wait,
let me just do my dress.

14:57.928 --> 14:59.831
Don't take that--no!
Stop it! Stop it.

14:59.865 --> 15:01.801
Jan, no, no, no!
Michael!

15:01.801 --> 15:04.040
No means please don't.

15:04.073 --> 15:05.509
Slam me up against the wall,
right here.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.213
I'm not gonna slam you
up against anything.

15:07.245 --> 15:08.916
Oh, please, I want you so--
You're acting inappropriate.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.887
I'm acting inappropriate?
Jan--yeah.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.255
(Jan)
Forget it, get away from me.

15:18.402 --> 15:19.370
Here.

15:19.404 --> 15:20.506
Hey.

15:20.538 --> 15:21.508
Where have you been
all night?

15:21.540 --> 15:23.311
I was looking forward
to hanging out with you.

15:23.345 --> 15:24.981
I was...

15:25.016 --> 15:28.022
Hey, don't you have
a daughter?

15:28.054 --> 15:30.893
Yes.

15:30.927 --> 15:33.564
[creaking]

15:37.705 --> 15:39.410
Oh, good, you're up.

15:39.444 --> 15:40.379
Hey, who makes' this chair?

15:40.412 --> 15:43.284
I don't know,
it was here when I was born.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.024
Hmm.
I want one.

15:46.058 --> 15:48.028
Really good,
solid construction.

15:48.062 --> 15:49.030
It's comfortable.

15:49.064 --> 15:50.231
[knocking]

15:50.265 --> 15:51.633
What is this? Oak?

15:51.668 --> 15:54.239
I don't know.

15:54.273 --> 15:56.478
What do you know?

16:04.996 --> 16:07.266
God, I hate these parties.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.570
You wanna sneak out back
and shoot some hoops?

16:13.644 --> 16:15.416
Meet me outside
in two minutes.

16:15.449 --> 16:19.356
You stay here and have fun,
'cause I'm gonna go out back

16:19.389 --> 16:21.093
and shoot hoops
with David Wallace.

16:21.128 --> 16:23.032
Okay.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.138
Oh, um, don't mention
that you and I are dating,

16:26.170 --> 16:28.475
'cause I think he might
still have feelings for me.

16:28.508 --> 16:29.777
Wallace?

16:29.809 --> 16:31.514
What the hell?

16:31.548 --> 16:33.485
Have you dated, like,
every guy here?

16:36.323 --> 16:39.164
[laughter]

16:39.197 --> 16:40.566
Wow.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.103
Okay.

16:42.136 --> 16:43.105
You got me.

16:43.138 --> 16:44.439
I so got you.

16:44.473 --> 16:45.808
So, none of them.

16:45.841 --> 16:47.580
Of course not.

16:47.613 --> 16:51.221
I mean, you're kind of,
like, my first.

16:51.253 --> 16:52.656
Really?

16:52.690 --> 16:54.560
Oh, my God, it's so easy,
it's not even fun.

16:54.594 --> 16:55.629
Okay.

16:59.570 --> 17:00.606
Hey, Jan.

17:00.639 --> 17:02.042
Not too good.

17:05.215 --> 17:06.350
Did you get a chance
to try

17:06.384 --> 17:08.688
Michael's
homemade potato salad?

17:08.721 --> 17:10.559
Rachel thinks that I brought
homemade potato salad.

17:10.591 --> 17:13.432
And I just picked it up
at the supermarket.

17:13.465 --> 17:16.503
It's funny, I wish I could make
potato salad that good.

17:16.538 --> 17:18.442
It's just potatoes
and mayonnaise.

17:18.474 --> 17:20.845
There's something wrong
with Jan.

17:20.879 --> 17:22.349
[grunting]

17:22.383 --> 17:25.756
What's, uh, what's
with Jan and Michael?

17:25.788 --> 17:28.361
I don't know.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.498
Where to begin?

17:30.531 --> 17:33.504
[laughter]

17:33.537 --> 17:35.441
[crashing]

17:42.555 --> 17:44.526
My ball.

17:44.559 --> 17:46.331
(Dwight)
The chimney's in decent shape.

17:46.363 --> 17:48.534
Not great, I found
some termite damage

17:48.567 --> 17:51.241
in a crawlspace
and some structural flaws

17:51.274 --> 17:55.581
in the foundation,
so all in all...

17:55.615 --> 17:58.587
it was a pretty fun
cocktail party.

18:00.826 --> 18:02.162
What?

18:02.162 --> 18:05.236
I want us to make it.

18:05.269 --> 18:06.538
I want a fresh start.

18:06.571 --> 18:08.341
That's awesome.

18:08.375 --> 18:09.510
That's what I want.

18:09.544 --> 18:12.782
Okay, but in order
for us to make it,

18:12.815 --> 18:14.853
there can't be any secrets
between us.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.723
The--I didn't do anything.

18:16.758 --> 18:18.961
Ask anybody,
I totally could've,

18:18.995 --> 18:20.266
and I didn't at all.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.801
Just listen.

18:21.833 --> 18:24.574
Remember that casino night
about a month

18:24.606 --> 18:26.444
before we were supposed
to get married?

18:26.477 --> 18:27.946
I kissed Jim.

18:27.979 --> 18:30.252
What?

18:30.286 --> 18:33.392
He told me how he felt,
and I guess I had feelings too,

18:33.424 --> 18:34.494
and we kissed.

18:34.526 --> 18:35.661
Jim came on to you?

18:35.695 --> 18:36.597
Just listen.

18:36.630 --> 18:37.699
No, I am listening!

18:37.733 --> 18:38.967
That's the problem,
I'm listening!

18:39.002 --> 18:40.036
Don't yell.

18:40.069 --> 18:41.673
[yelling]
Don't yell?

18:45.949 --> 18:47.485
This is over.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.589
Yeah, you're right,
this is so over.

18:49.623 --> 18:51.693
You kidding me, Pam?

18:51.727 --> 18:53.832
Come on!

18:53.865 --> 18:56.637
God!

18:56.670 --> 18:59.643
Damn Jet Skis!

19:04.520 --> 19:06.558
Our first fight.

19:08.828 --> 19:10.931
If this is about what happened
in the bathroom,

19:10.965 --> 19:12.935
there was no place
to cuddle.

19:12.969 --> 19:15.441
I feel sick.

19:15.475 --> 19:17.345
You didn't have any
of the potato salad, did you?

19:17.380 --> 19:20.486
You know, we were good when we
were just running around.

19:20.518 --> 19:21.720
You know, in secret.

19:21.753 --> 19:23.524
It was wrong,
and it was exciting.

19:23.558 --> 19:27.665
And maybe it was a mistake
to take it public.

19:31.105 --> 19:34.380
Well, if that's the way
you feel,

19:34.414 --> 19:36.851
my lady, then you
have hurt me greatly.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.821
Michael.
Greatly.

19:38.855 --> 19:40.024
Please don't cry.

19:40.057 --> 19:41.394
[choked up]
I'm not going to cry.

19:41.428 --> 19:43.965
I feel like it,
but I am not going to.

19:43.998 --> 19:46.737
Why don't you just take
your stupid love contract

19:46.770 --> 19:48.006
and tear it up
into a million pieces?

19:48.040 --> 19:49.676
It was never
a love contract, Michael.

19:49.709 --> 19:51.448
And besides, I've already given
a copy to David

19:51.481 --> 19:52.550
and it would be
just as embarrassing

19:52.583 --> 19:54.753
to get it back from him
as it was handing it to him.

19:54.786 --> 19:57.091
I want the house, Jan!
I want the picket fence.

19:57.123 --> 19:59.829
I want the ketchup fights,
and the tickling,

19:59.863 --> 20:02.402
and the giggling.

20:04.706 --> 20:06.142
I didn't mean it,
okay?

20:06.175 --> 20:08.647
I was...I was tired.
Whatever.

20:08.682 --> 20:10.752
I'm tired,
and I didn't eat enough.

20:10.786 --> 20:12.020
You didn't mean it.
And that's all.

20:12.053 --> 20:13.758
That's was it.
That's it, you didn't mean it.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.093
No, I didn't.
So...

20:15.126 --> 20:19.737
That's all, I'm just saying
I didn't mean it.

20:19.769 --> 20:22.073
[sighs]

20:22.108 --> 20:23.644
I love you, Jan.

20:23.678 --> 20:24.779
Okay.

20:29.656 --> 20:32.061
Don't break up,
you guys.

20:32.093 --> 20:34.231
[sighs]

20:34.266 --> 20:36.870
You're great together.

20:55.676 --> 20:57.745
Are they gonna call
the cops?

20:57.780 --> 21:00.249
No, I paid them off.

21:00.285 --> 21:03.724
[sighing]
Jet Ski money?

21:03.758 --> 21:05.127
All of it.

21:05.160 --> 21:08.166
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
