SLEAZY IF WE HIRE A PRETI'Y GIRL.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.764
- AND WHEN SHE WINS,
IT'S TO BOOST HER CONFIDENCE

07:05.870 --> 07:07.201
AND TO HELP HER
LEARN THE GAME.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.413
- SHE DOESN'T NEED CONFIDENCE,
HONEY, SHE NEEDS HUMILITY.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.690
- OKAY.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.179

- THE BIG KID? HE'S KIND OF--
A LITTLE BIGGER THAN YOU?

08:16.250 --> 08:17.000

08:17.110 --> 08:19.908

08:50.660 --> 08:53.072

JUST RIDE YOUR BIKE

08:53.180 --> 08:56.308

08:56.430 --> 08:57.806
THAT'S NEW.
THAT'S A DEVELOPMENT.

08:57.910 --> 09:00.049

KIDS LIKE LISTENING TO THIS.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.604

BOTTLES OF WATER OR ANYTHING?

10:26.620 --> 10:29.418
- OH, UH, ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANNA GO WITH FAUCET?

10:29.520 --> 10:31.795
IT'S, UH, BETTER
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

10:31.900 --> 10:33.310
- JUST SOMETHING LIQUID

10:33.420 --> 10:35.069

11:12.080 --> 11:13.240
WE LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.539
- WOW, I GUESS
I'LL TEXT YOU.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.154
WHY DID YOU KICK HER OUT?
WHAT--

11:23.260 --> 11:24.363
- I DIDN'T KICK HER OUT.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.711
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD WANT
HER TO SEE--YOU KNOW?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.674
- MM, GREAT.
YEAH, GREAT.

11:28.790 --> 11:30.121
- "GREAT, YEAH"?
- I MEAN, I--

11:30.240 --> 11:33.198
- THAT'S YOUR REACTION TO A "D"?
- YEAH.

11:33.310 --> 11:34.379
- DREW?

11:34.480 --> 11:36.892

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.797
WH--IT'S
MY QUARTERLY REPORT CARD.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.276
IT'S NOT EVEN
A FINAL GRADE, 50--

11:40.380 --> 11:41.938
- WELL, IT'S NOT A FINAL GRADE,
BUT A QUARTERLY IS A...

11:42.040 --> 11:44.213
- YEAH, I CAN BRING IT UP.
- SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE YEAR.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.662
CAN YOU PUT THE PHONE DOWN,
PLEASE?

11:45.770 --> 11:46.839
- I'M TRYING TO APOLOGIZE
BECAUSE YOU JUST--

11:46.940 --> 11:47.929
- CAN YOU PUT THE PHONE DOWN

11:48.050 --> 11:50.143
BECAUSE I'M TALKING YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

11:50.260 --> 11:52.251
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS FROM YOU.
IT'S YOUR JUNIOR YEAR.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.112
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A HARD CLASS, I MEAN--

11:54.230 --> 11:55.913
[cell phone chimes]
- YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR HELP.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.942
PLEASE PUT THE PHONE DOWN.
THAT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

11:58.060 --> 11:58.947
- I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE
SHE'S SAFE.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.267
- IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.
I'M SPEAKING TO YOU.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.814
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT
YOU HAVE BEEN SPENDING

12:02.920 --> 12:04.364
TOO MUCH TIME WITH AMY.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.924
SHE'S A VERY NICE GIRL, BUT--
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:06.030 --> 12:07.474
- I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T SEE HER
DURING THE WEEK.

12:07.580 --> 12:08.717
I'M NOT KIDDING YOU.

12:08.830 --> 12:10.548
IT'S THE ONE CHANGE
THAT HAS HAPPENED

12:10.660 --> 12:11.820
THAT IS THE ONLY EXPLANATION
FOR THIS.

12:11.930 --> 12:12.965
I LIKE HER VERY MUCH.
SHE'S A GREAT GIRL.

12:13.070 --> 12:13.798
- I CAN'T EVEN--GREAT.
I'LL JUST STUDY.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.629
- YOU CAN SEE HER
ON THE WEEKENDS.

12:15.730 --> 12:17.721
DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU'RE NOT TO
SEE HER DURING THE WEEK, OKAY?

12:17.840 --> 12:19.979
- LOOK,
I'M TRYING TO STUDY.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.943
[door slams]

12:30.190 --> 12:31.111
[sighs]

12:36.650 --> 12:37.981
- HAVE WE EVER
LET SYDNEY LOSE?

12:38.100 --> 12:39.260
- ARE YOU TAKING MY DAD
SERIOUSLY NOW?

12:39.370 --> 12:41.884
- NO, THINK ABOUT IT.
- BABE, IT'S RIDICULOUS.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.649
- OKAY, I'M THINKING ABOUT IT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:43.760 --> 12:45.819
I'M PRETTY SURE
WE'VE NEVER LET HER LOSE.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.727
NOT AT TIC-TAC-TOE,
NOT AT CHECKERS,

12:47.830 --> 12:49.513
NOT A SINGLE GAME
IN HER ENTIRE LIFE.

12:49.630 --> 12:50.858
IT'S BEEN NOTHING BUT WIN,
HONEY.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.382
- [chuckles]
SHE IS SEVEN YEARS OLD!

12:53.490 --> 12:54.696
- YEAH.
- SO WHAT?

12:54.800 --> 12:57.280
WE LET HER LOSE AT TIC-TAC-TOE?
WHAT IS THAT GONNA PROVE?

12:57.390 --> 12:58.903
- THAT IT HAPPENS.
IT'S PART OF LIFE.

12:59.010 --> 13:00.773
- [sighs]
IT'S MY DAD'S THING.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.041
HE'S OBSESSED
WITH A PURE GAME.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.912
AND HE'S MADE ALL OF
HIS CHILDREN OBSESSED WITH IT.

13:05.020 --> 13:06.817
AND I REFUSE TO LET SYDNEY
BE RAISED THAT WAY.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.262
- HERE.
- WHAT IS THE--

13:08.370 --> 13:10.463
- I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
WOULD YOU PUT THIS ON ME?

13:10.580 --> 13:11.956
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

13:12.060 --> 13:13.163
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
TO CHALLENGE HER IN A FOOTRACE?

13:13.270 --> 13:15.955
- I WAS THINKING ARM WRESTLING.
TOO MUCH?

13:16.070 --> 13:17.332
- SHE'S FINE.
- YEAH?

13:17.450 --> 13:19.236
- YEAH.
OKAY?

13:19.350 --> 13:20.920
- YOU'RE CUTE
WHEN YOU'RE IN DENIAL.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.587
- I HAVE BEAT HER
AT SOMETHING!

13:22.690 --> 13:23.588
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T!
- I HAVE.

13:23.690 --> 13:24.725
- NAME IT.

13:24.830 --> 13:27.936
AH, YOUR SILENCE
PROVES MY POINT.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.009
LI'I'I'LE SPOILED BRAT.
[sighs]

13:31.120 --> 13:34.180
- I JUST DON'T SEE HOW
SHE CAN JUSTIFY GROUNDING ME

13:34.290 --> 13:37.498
FROM A PERSON--
FROM A HUMAN.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.807
- DUDE, I MEAN, THIS IS
THE STORY OF MY LIFE WITH HER.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.195
- NO, BUT IT'S--I SWEAR,
IT'S LIKE, IT'S WORSE NOW.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.847
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T JUST GO A WEEK

13:43.960 --> 13:45.985
WITHOUT TALKING TO SOMEONE.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.853
- SOMEONE SPECIAL
MAYBE?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.997
- I MEAN, YOU CAN.
- AWW.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.988
- TOO MUCH. TOO SOON.
- OKAY, SORRY.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.271
LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND,

13:55.380 --> 13:58.269
BUT, I MEAN,
THERE ARE ALWAYS OPTIONS.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.938
- MM...LIKE WHAT?

14:00.040 --> 14:03.828
- COME ON.
SHE WORKS AT NIGHT.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.931
YOU KNOW, AND LIVES IN,
LIKE, A SEPARATE HOUSE.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.075
- I MEAN, HELLO! IT'S LIKE--
- YEAH, BUT...

14:08.190 --> 14:10.351
- JUST GET ON OUT OF THERE.
- IF I TRIED TO SNEAK OUT,

14:10.470 --> 14:12.938
AND SHE CAUGHT ME--

- OKAY, SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH DR. PELIKAN TODAY AT 3:00,

14:27.690 --> 14:29.681
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T
MAKE IT, SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?

14:29.790 --> 14:32.964
SHOULD I GO BY MYSELF,
OR SHOULD I JUST RESCHEDULE IT

14:33.070 --> 14:34.446
OR TRY TO GO
FOR A DIFFERENT DAY?

14:34.560 --> 14:35.936
- TELL YOU WHAT.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.076
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE
DR. PELIKAN YOURSELF,

14:38.180 --> 14:40.000
AND UH, YOU KNOW,
JUST SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.008
IF THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER, YOU KNOW,

14:42.120 --> 14:43.803
HE MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION
ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

14:43.910 --> 14:45.798
SO GO FOR IT.
- OKAY, I WILL.

14:45.910 --> 14:46.979
I WILL.
HOW'S WORK GOING FOR YOU?

14:47.090 --> 14:47.988

14:54.650 --> 14:56.925
I'M GONNA HAVE TO--I'M GONNA

15:17.190 --> 15:19.215
JUST--IT'S A COMPLICATED THING
WITH MY SON.

15:19.330 --> 15:22.561
HE HAS ASPERGER'S, AND MY WIFE
THINKS THAT THIS OTHER KID

15:22.680 --> 15:24.124

BULLYING HIM AT SCHOOL.

15:24.230 --> 15:26.084

WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.434

[mumbling]
41...1...

22:12.080 --> 22:14.321
[buzzer goes Off]
0.16.

22:14.430 --> 22:15.943
- THAT IS CORRECT!

22:16.050 --> 22:17.290
- YEAH, IT'S BECAUSE 25
GOES INTO 4 ZERO TIMES.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.914
IT GOES INTO 40 ONE TIME,

22:20.020 --> 22:22.261
AND THEN FROM 40, YOU GET 15,
AND YOU BRING DOWN A ZERO.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.474
AND IT GOES INTO 150
SIX TIMES.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.332
- YES,
RIGHT.

22:26.440 --> 22:30.683
[chuckles]

22:30.790 --> 22:33.236
[inaudible]

22:33.350 --> 22:35.932
NEXT QUESTION.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.929
- JOEL?
SYD?

22:39.040 --> 22:41.031
- OH.

22:41.150 --> 22:44.449
IS SYDNEY IN THERE?
- UH-HUH.

22:44.570 --> 22:46.071
- DID YOU BEAT HER
AT CANDYLAND?

22:46.190 --> 22:48.181
- YEP.
- DADDY, DADDY!

22:48.290 --> 22:50.736
- OKAY, SHE DID NOT
TAKE LOSING WELL.

22:50.850 --> 22:52.909
- LET ME OUT OF HERE
RIGHT THIS INSTANT!

22:53.020 --> 22:53.941
DADDY!

22:54.060 --> 22:56.016
- I REALLY HATE IT
WHEN MY DAD IS RIGHT.

22:56.130 --> 22:57.290
- ME TOO.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.911
- LET ME OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW!
I HATE YOU!

22:59.030 --> 23:00.406
YOU'RE THE WORST DADDY EVER!
[thud]

23:00.510 --> 23:02.853
- UM, I'M GONNA GO.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.928
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
- LET ME OUT!

23:05.030 --> 23:08.966
- UM, MAYBE WORK OUT.
MAYBE A LONG MOVIE.

23:09.070 --> 23:10.958
MAYBE BOTH, SO, UM, GOOD LUCK.
- I HATE YOU, DADDY!

23:11.070 --> 23:12.583
I HATE YOU!

23:12.700 --> 23:15.419
NO TV, TECHNOLOGY, JUST--
- OKAY.

23:15.530 --> 23:18.454
- OKAY.
SEE YA.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.731
- AND I'VE HEARD
ALL THE ARGUMENTS--

23:19.840 --> 23:21.046
- HEY, MAX.
WHAT'S UP?

23:21.150 --> 23:22.321
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

23:22.430 --> 23:24.603
- HONEY, THAT'S LOUIS.
- WHICH ONE?

23:24.710 --> 23:27.634
- THE ONE THAT LOOKS
LIKE TED KOPPEL.

23:27.750 --> 23:29.638
- FOUR RED PENS
AND FIVE GREEN PENS IN BOX.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.672
AND A GUY COMES TO PICK
ONE OF THOSE PENS

23:31.780 --> 23:32.781
OUT OF THAT BOX
WITHOUT LOOKING.

23:32.890 --> 23:34.778
WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY
IT WILL BE BLUE?

23:34.890 --> 23:37.233
- BLUE PEN, BLUE PEN,
BLUE PEN, BLUE PEN.

23:37.340 --> 23:38.477
- CHECK IT OUT.
- FREAKY, HUH?

23:38.580 --> 23:42.926
[Max muttering,
stamping lightly]

23:43.040 --> 23:44.826
- IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY ANYMORE.
IT'S KIND OF--

23:44.940 --> 23:46.555
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN STOP NOW.

23:46.660 --> 23:48.389
- OH, NO, WAIT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE THE RIGHT TIME.

23:48.490 --> 23:50.173
IT'S .25.
CHECK YOUR WATCH.

23:50.290 --> 23:51.791
- NOBODY CARES, MAX.

23:51.910 --> 23:53.662
YOU GUYS WANNA GO TO SWENSEN'S
FOR ICE CREAM?

23:53.770 --> 23:54.907
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO.

23:55.010 --> 23:56.807
- I'LL SEE YOU AT PRACTICE!
- BYE.

23:56.910 --> 24:00.983
[laughter]

24:01.090 --> 24:03.775
- [sighs]

24:03.890 --> 24:05.778
- ARE YOU STILL THERE,
MOMMY?

24:05.890 --> 24:08.711
- YEP, I'M RIGHT HERE,
SWEETIE.

24:08.820 --> 24:10.742
- THIS IS UNFAIR!
UNFAIR!

24:10.860 --> 24:12.748
MOMMY,
THIS IS NOT FAIR!

24:12.860 --> 24:15.579
YOU PUT DADDY ON TIME-OUT,
NOT ME!

24:15.690 --> 24:19.103
- SWEETHEART, IF YOU SPEAK
IN AN INSIDE VOICE,

24:19.210 --> 24:20.518
YOU'LL CALM
YOUR BODY DOWN--

24:20.630 --> 24:23.906
- I WILL NOT CALM MY BODY DOWN!
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME!

24:24.010 --> 24:25.489
- THAT'S TRUE,
I CANNOT MAKE YOU.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.931
ONLY YOU CAN.

24:27.050 --> 24:29.939
- WELL, THIS IS NOT OKAY
TO KEEP ME IN TIME-OUT!

24:30.050 --> 24:32.905
[stammers] WHAT IS THIS?
[indistinct]

24:33.020 --> 24:33.975
[thudding on door]

24:34.090 --> 24:36.809
- SWEETHEART, IT IS NOT OKAY
TO KICK THE DOOR!

24:36.920 --> 24:39.434
- NO, THIS IS NOT FAIR!
- SYDNEY.

24:39.540 --> 24:41.576
THIS IS NOT FAIR!
[thudding continues]

24:41.680 --> 24:43.853
I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU,
I HATE YOU!

24:43.960 --> 24:46.099
LET ME OUT OF HERE!
I HATE YOU!

24:52.110 --> 24:52.929
- I CANNOT BELIEVE WE WERE
UNDEFEATED THIS WHOLE SEASON.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.484
DID YOU GUYS KNOW
THAT I'M THE STAR PLAYER?

24:54.590 --> 24:56.000
- GOOD JOB, BUD.
- THAT'S AWESOME.

24:56.110 --> 24:57.725
- GET READY FOR BED, AND I'LL
COME TUCK YOU IN IN A SECOND.

24:57.840 --> 24:58.864
ADAM, WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

24:58.980 --> 25:00.242
WE NEED TO DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.588
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
- THIS KID, LOUIS,

25:01.700 --> 25:02.974
RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN,
HE EXCLUDES MAX.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.729
HE WAS MAKING FUN OF HIM,
MAKING FACES BEHIND HIS BACK.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.728
- HONEY, I SAW IT.
I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

25:06.850 --> 25:08.010
- YOU SAW--OF COURSE NOT.
- IT'S A TRICKY SITUATION, OKAY?

25:08.120 --> 25:09.769
- BUT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE
ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:09.880 --> 25:11.017
I THINK THAT
WE SHOULD CALL HIS PARENTS.

25:11.130 --> 25:12.358
- OH, GOD, NO. HONEY,
WE CAN'T CALL THE--

25:12.470 --> 25:14.017
[cell phone rings]
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

25:14.130 --> 25:15.779
- NOTHING IS GETTING DONE.
NOTHING'S GETTING RESOLVED.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.573
- [sighs] UNBELIEVABLE.
- WHO IS THAT?

25:17.680 --> 25:18.851
- IT'S CROSBY.
- WHAT DOES HE WANT?

25:18.960 --> 25:20.166
- OH, GOD.
HE'S SAYS I'VE GOTTA COME

25:20.270 --> 25:20.998
INTO THE STUDIO--
IT'S URGENT.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.783
- EVERYTHING WITH CROSBY
IS URGENT, ADAM.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.720
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

25:24.830 --> 25:26.161
- WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS
TONIGHT, OKAY?

25:26.280 --> 25:27.656
- ADAM, WE NEED TO DEAL
WITH THIS, PLEASE.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.967
- LISTEN, HONEY,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, OKAY?

25:30.080 --> 25:30.865
BUT I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING,
OKAY?

25:30.970 --> 25:33.029
- YOU CAN'T GO RIGHT NOW.
- LISTEN.

25:33.150 --> 25:34.310
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT
IT'S TIME FOR US TO JUMP IN

25:34.420 --> 25:35.626
AND, YOU KNOW,
CALL THE PARENTS.

25:35.740 --> 25:36.900
THAT'S
A NUCLEAR OPTION THAT

25:37.010 --> 25:38.284
COULD JUST BLOW UP
IN OUR FACES, OKAY?

25:38.390 --> 25:39.766
- HONEY, PLEASE. JUST--
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO DOWN THERE.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.154
- I CAN'T. I HAVE TO GO.
HE'S NOT GONNA STOP.

25:41.260 --> 25:42.636
- WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?
- I GOTTA GO.

25:42.740 --> 25:43.946
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
HE SAYS IT'S URGENT.

25:44.050 --> 25:44.982
I LOVE YOU, OKAY?

25:45.090 --> 25:45.840
- I'M NOT OVERREACTING, ADAM.
- ALL RIGHT?

25:45.950 --> 25:47.508
- ADAM!
- I GOTTA GO.

25:47.610 --> 25:48.918
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

25:49.030 --> 25:49.985
- HONEY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS--IT'S URGENT.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.955
- THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE.
- I AGREE.

25:53.060 --> 25:54.925
- [sighs]

25:55.030 --> 25:56.918
- THE GRADE WAS JUST ONE THING.
- RIGHT.

25:57.030 --> 25:58.895
- AND I THOUGHT THE PUNISHMENT
WAS REALLY FAIR.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.729
AND THEN
HE'S GONNA SNEAK OUT?

26:00.830 --> 26:02.274
AND--IT WAS ALMOST
LIKE HE'S ASKING FOR IT.

26:02.380 --> 26:04.723
- COURSE HE'S GONNA SNEAK OUT.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:04.830 --> 26:06.582
- WELL, HE'S 16,
AND YOU TOLD HIM THAT

26:06.700 --> 26:08.213
HE CAN'T SEE
HIS FIRST GIRLFRIEND.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.595
HE'S GONNA FIND A WAY.
- IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.976
- I TH--I THINK THAT
THERE ARE WAYS OF GETTING DREW

26:14.080 --> 26:16.969
TO FOCUS ON HIS GRADES THAT--
THAT DON'T INVOLVE

26:17.090 --> 26:19.536
TAKING AWAY SOMETHING
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HIM,

26:19.640 --> 26:21.084
THAT'S MAKING HIM
SO HAPPY.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.225
- NO, IF YOU HAD KIDS,
YOU WOULD KNOW.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.535
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO
REALLY GIVE THEM A BOUNDARY.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.813
- YEAH.

26:28.930 --> 26:30.158
YEAH, I MEAN,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:30.270 --> 26:35.378
I'M NOT A PARENT,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME...

26:35.490 --> 26:38.004
I DEAL WITH A HUNDRED KIDS
A YEAR.

26:38.110 --> 26:40.385
THEY COME INTO MY CLASS,
AND I HAVE TO DISCIPLINE THEM.

26:40.490 --> 26:43.903
AND ANYTIME I SAY TO A KID,
"GET OUT OF MY CLASSROOM,"

26:44.010 --> 26:45.352
THEY GO,
"OH, FREE PERIOD!"

26:45.460 --> 26:46.870
AND IT DRIVES
A WEDGE BETWEEN US,

26:46.980 --> 26:49.904
AND THEY DON'T
LEARN ANYTHING.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.840
THEY JUST
ARE ANGRY AT ME.

26:51.950 --> 26:56.057
I'M JUST SAD FOR DREW
THAT HE DOESN'T GET TO SEE HER.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.641
I SEE HIM WITH HER IN THE HALLS,
AND HE'S SMILING AND TALKING.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.924
AND HE'S DOING VERY
UN-DREW-LIKE THINGS.

27:03.030 --> 27:05.169
HE'S SLOWLY COMING OUT
OF HIS SHELL AND...

27:05.270 --> 27:08.444
TO KEEP A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY AWAY
FROM HIS FIRST GIRLFRIEND

27:08.550 --> 27:11.622
IS A...A TOUGH JOB.

27:11.730 --> 27:14.961
- I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO
SAY 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.866
- NO, NO, THAT'S FAIR.
- OF COURSE YOU HAVE KIDS.

27:16.980 --> 27:18.698
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.451
BUT THANK YOU
FOR SAYING THAT.

27:21.570 --> 27:22.969
- ARE WE HAVING
OUR FIRST FIGHT?

27:23.080 --> 27:24.524
I FEEL--
THIS FEELS STRANGE.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.153
- I GUESS THAT QUALIFIES
AS A FIGHT.

27:26.260 --> 27:28.637
AND NOW WE CAN GET
STRAIGHT TO THE MAKING UP.

27:28.750 --> 27:29.819
[laughter]

27:29.920 --> 27:32.775
I MEAN,
NOT RIGHT HERE.

27:32.890 --> 27:34.983
- I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD PACE.

27:35.100 --> 27:35.919
- YOU LIKE THAT PACE?
- YEAH.

27:36.030 --> 27:39.193
- OKAY.

27:39.310 --> 27:41.824
[door squeaks Open]

27:41.930 --> 27:44.490
- IS THIS THE EMERGENCY?
- WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO SING.

27:44.590 --> 27:45.966
WHAT'S SO URGENT?
- OH, NOTHING.

27:46.070 --> 27:47.139
IT'S NOT REALLY
A BIG DEAL, ACTUALLY.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.899
- WHY DID YOU CALL ME
DOWN HERE?

27:49.010 --> 27:50.864
- OH, YOU--PROBABLY
WON'T EVEN INTEREST YOU.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.210
IT'S JUST THAT
GAVIN CALLED,

27:52.320 --> 27:54.003
AND HE WANTS TO BOOK OUR STUDIO
FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.144
- FOR THE WHOLE MONTH?
- YES.

27:55.250 --> 27:56.456
THIS IS GREAT!

27:56.570 --> 27:59.084
- HE WANTS TO HAVE ALL
OF HIS ARTISTS HERE AND MAKE US

27:59.190 --> 28:00.839
THE SINGLE BEST RECORDING STUDIO
IN THE BAY AREA.

28:00.950 --> 28:01.871
- THIS IS AWESOME!

28:01.990 --> 28:03.184
- YEAH, RIGHT?
- YEAH!

28:03.300 --> 28:04.437
- WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING
AROUND THE CLOCK.

28:04.540 --> 28:05.700
- WE'RE IN PROFIT.

28:05.820 --> 28:06.639
- ON TOP OF THAT,
ARTY PARTY'S DONE.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.218
- SO NO MORE
CRAZY WATER DEMANDS.

28:09.340 --> 28:10.477
- W-W-WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS IS GREAT NEWS,

28:10.580 --> 28:11.740
BUT WHY COULDN'T
YOU JUST EMAIL ME?

28:11.860 --> 28:13.578
- WELL, NO.
THERE'S A THIRD THING.

28:13.690 --> 28:15.920
RACHEL, PLEASE. SHOW HIM.
- I CAN'T.

28:16.030 --> 28:19.682
- THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST.
- FROM THE HILLS OF OAXACA.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.789
- I CAN HAVE ONE DRINK,
THEN I GOTTA GO HOME.

28:20.900 --> 28:21.798
- WE HAVE TO TOAST RACHEL...
- NO, NO, NO.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.039
- BECAUSE SHE WAS A HUGE PART--
- REALLY?

28:24.150 --> 28:25.936
- YES.
- I DID NOTHING AT ALL.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.769
- GAVIN WENT ON
AND ON AND ON ABOUT

28:27.870 --> 28:29.622
WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLE BEAUTY
SHE WAS.

28:29.740 --> 28:30.695
- AH...
- I'M GONNA GO GET

28:30.810 --> 28:32.869
SOME SHOT GLASSES.
- I SEE.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.869
- GOOD THING I LEI-T
MY TURTLENECK AT HOME, RIGHT?

28:35.990 --> 28:38.458
- HA HA.
VERY FUNNY.

28:38.570 --> 28:39.912
- [clears throat]

28:40.020 --> 28:42.227
LISTEN, RACHEL.
YOU'RE JUST--

28:42.340 --> 28:44.399
YOU'RE SUCH A SMART,
BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

28:44.510 --> 28:46.262
ALL I WAS TRYING TO SAY
THE OTHER DAY WAS THAT

28:46.370 --> 28:48.338
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRADE
ON YOUR LOOKS, YOU KNOW?

28:48.450 --> 28:49.269
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FLIRT

28:49.380 --> 28:50.472
WITH EVERY GUY WHO COMES
IN HERE, ASKING--

28:50.590 --> 28:54.378
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
I DIDN'T FLIRT WITH HIM AT ALL.

28:54.490 --> 28:56.173
I PROMISE.
- OKAY.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.840
I JUST, YOU KNOW, IT JUST MAKES
ME THINK THAT YOU BELIEVE

28:58.940 --> 29:00.658
ALL YOU HAVE GOING FOR YOU
IS YOUR LOOKS,

29:00.770 --> 29:03.762
AND THAT'S JUST--
IT'S NOT TRUE.

29:03.880 --> 29:06.383
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO YOU
THAN THAT.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.250
ANYWAY, ENOUGH SAID.
SORRY.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.464
- OKAY. HEY! BIB FOR YOU.
- NICE.

29:09.570 --> 29:11.322
- SHOT GLASSES
WERE RETRIEVED.

29:11.430 --> 29:13.842
THEY SEEMED TO BE HIDDEN IN YOUR
TOP DESK DRAWER FOR SOME REASON.

29:13.950 --> 29:16.054
- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE.
- YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING--

29:16.160 --> 29:17.980
- I CAN HAVE ONE DRINK, AND
THEN I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.500
- LADY.
- THANKS, THAT'S REALLY BIG.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.121
- OKAY.
HERE WE GO.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.299
- TO THE LUNCHEONETTE.
- TO THE LUNCHEONETTE.

29:24.410 --> 29:25.786
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

29:25.900 --> 29:28.107
- CHEERS.
CONGRATULATIONS.

29:31.450 --> 29:32.269
- OH!
- THAT IS GOOD!

29:32.390 --> 29:33.277
- OH, WOW.

29:33.390 --> 29:36.041
[clattering]

29:36.150 --> 29:36.969
- HI.

29:37.080 --> 29:40.948
- I CAME IN
FOR SUPPLIES.

29:41.050 --> 29:43.325
- HOW WAS
YOUR DATE?

29:43.430 --> 29:45.421
- IT WAS REALLY NICE.

29:48.130 --> 29:51.952
HOW WAS
YOUR NIGHT?

29:52.060 --> 29:54.813
- FINE.
- HOW'S DREW?

29:54.930 --> 29:58.331
- HE'S IN HIS ROOM.

29:58.450 --> 30:00.782
UM, NO ESCAPE ATTEMPTS.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.924
- THAT'S GOOD.

30:02.040 --> 30:07.342
I WAS TALKING ABOUT HIM TONIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

30:07.460 --> 30:12.875
JUST DELIBERATELY DEFYING ME...
IT'S SO STRANGE.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.698
- YEAH, I KNOW ABOUT THAT,
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

30:14.810 --> 30:16.562
BUT YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WORK HERE.

30:16.670 --> 30:18.319
OKAY, I'M NOT A WATCHDOG.

30:18.430 --> 30:19.988
I CAN'T SIT OUT ON THE PORCH
AND KEEP TRACK

30:20.090 --> 30:21.489
OF EVERYBODY
WHO'S COMING AND GOING.

30:21.610 --> 30:22.360
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LIFE.

30:22.470 --> 30:25.030
AT THE MOMENT,
I GOT MY HANDS FULL.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.299
- I KNOW YOU DON'T WORK HERE,
MOM.

30:32.380 --> 30:34.587
WHEN I DID FIGURE YOU'D BE HOME,
AND I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD ASK.

30:34.690 --> 30:35.918
- THOUGHT YOU'D ASK.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.895
YEAH, IT'S SUPPOSED TO SOUND
LIKE AN ASK.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.969
BUT YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS
MORE TO ME LIKE A DEMAND.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.548
MOST OF THE TIME,
IT'S ALWAYS A DANCE WITH YOU.

30:44.670 --> 30:45.978
SARAH, YOU KNOW,
AND THE ONE HAND,

30:46.080 --> 30:47.900
WHAT YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO FOR YOU,

30:48.010 --> 30:48.942
HELP YOU
WITH AUTOMATICALLY,

30:49.050 --> 30:50.529
AND ON THE OTHER HAND,

30:50.640 --> 30:52.039
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO EXPRESS
MY OPINION ABOUT ANYTHING.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.946
KEEP IT TO MYSELF,
YOU KNOW?

30:54.050 --> 30:57.884
I'M GETTING
KIND OF TIRED OF IT, SO...

30:57.990 --> 30:59.912
DREW IS OLD ENOUGH TO STAY
IN THE HOUSE BY HIMSELF.

31:00.030 --> 31:00.985
NEEDLESS TO SAY.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.886
SO IF YOU THINK
OTHERWISE,

31:02.990 --> 31:06.505
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TALK
TO DREW ABOUT IT.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.340
- [whispers] HEY.

31:16.460 --> 31:17.939
HEY.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.793

31:20.910 --> 31:22.901
- HI.

31:23.010 --> 31:25.251
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

31:25.360 --> 31:27.874

- FOR WHAT, HONEY?

31:27.980 --> 31:30.778
- FOR SYD.
BABE, WE--WE JUST--

31:30.880 --> 31:33.462
WE TOLD HER SHE WAS GREAT

31:33.580 --> 31:36.048
WE LET HER WIN ALL THE TIME.
- YEAH.

31:36.170 --> 31:40.880
- AND WE JUST GAVE HER
TOO MUCH STUFF ALL THE TIME.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.786
AND WE RUINED HER.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.447
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:44.550 --> 31:46.825
WE'RE GONNA GET ANOTHER BABY,
THEN WE'LL START OVER.

31:46.930 --> 31:48.682
THIS ONE'S A BUST.
- BABE, THAT'S NOT FUNNY!

31:48.800 --> 31:50.586
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY.
COME ON.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.839
- OKAY.
- OKAY, LET'S GET UP.

31:52.940 --> 31:55.044
WHEN I WAS SEVEN,
I WAS A HELLION.

31:55.150 --> 31:56.378
- YEAH.
- I TURNED OUT OKAY.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.116
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

31:59.220 --> 32:02.257
- YOU'RE GREAT.
- [chuckles]

32:05.610 --> 32:06.531
YOU KILLED HER.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.643
[both laugh]

32:12.340 --> 32:14.786
WOW, LOOK AT
OUR LITTLE SPOILED BRAT.

32:14.890 --> 32:18.303
OH, MY GOD, I LOVE HER.
SHE'S SO CUTE.

32:18.410 --> 32:21.379
- SHOULD WE JUST CHUCK HER?
- YEAH.

32:21.490 --> 32:23.481
- ONE, TWO, THREE.

32:26.970 --> 32:29.791

32:34.220 --> 32:37.223
[The Stones song plays]

32:39.260 --> 32:42.263

32:49.030 --> 32:53.990
[both laughing]

32:54.110 --> 32:56.681

I TORE SOMETHING.

33:07.810 --> 33:09.186
OH, OH, OH, OH.

33:09.290 --> 33:12.600

I THINK I HAVE TO GO HOME.

33:12.710 --> 33:13.984
I HAVE TO GO

HOW ARE YOU GETTING HOME?

33:18.960 --> 33:20.609

33:23.790 --> 33:25.849
- NO, NO, NO, I'M TOTALLY FINE.
I LOVE THE RAIN.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.097

[song continues]

33:54.680 --> 33:56.022
- IT'S RIGHT HERE.

33:56.130 --> 33:57.711
- RACHEL, THIS NEIGHBORHOOD'S
A LITTLE SKETCHY.

33:57.820 --> 34:00.095
ONLY A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY,
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

34:00.210 --> 34:01.063
THERE WAS A SHOOTING.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

34:01.170 --> 34:02.398
- NO,
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.613
- DO YOUR PARENTS
KNOW THAT?

34:04.730 --> 34:06.960
- IT'S REALLY FINE.
IT'S VERY SAFE.

34:07.070 --> 34:08.105

WALK YOU UP TO YOUR DOOR?

34:10.110 --> 34:11.520
IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
A LOT BETTER.

34:11.630 --> 34:13.279

I MADE YOU FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS.

34:52.950 --> 34:53.905

I JUST--

34:54.020 --> 34:54.736
- I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

34:54.850 --> 34:57.774
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

34:57.880 --> 35:03.022
- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT ME BEING SMART.

35:03.130 --> 35:04.859
- WELL, YOU ARE,
AND YOU'RE WELCOME.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.188
- I MEAN, I AM, YEAH.

35:06.310 --> 35:10.963
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
ANYONE EVER NOTICES ABOUT ME.

35:11.070 --> 35:14.654
PROBABLY 'CAUSE I MAKE SURE THAT
THEY NOTICE MY RACK FIRST.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.766
YOU'RE
A REALLY GOOD BOSS,

35:18.870 --> 35:23.978
AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE

36:08.920 --> 36:10.774
WHAT WAS
THE BIG EMERGENCY?

36:10.890 --> 36:12.437

YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME IN SCHOOL.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.979
I CAN GET THE GRADE UP.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.900
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

38:59.950 --> 39:01.633
- I KNOW THAT.

39:01.750 --> 39:05.572
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO START THIS SENTENCE

39:05.680 --> 39:10.094
THAT DOESN'T START WITH,
"SOMEDAY, WHEN YOU'RE A PARENT."

39:10.200 --> 39:12.998
[both chuckle]

39:13.100 --> 39:15.580
- YOU KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

39:15.690 --> 39:17.829
PROTECT YOUR KIDS
AND TAKE CARE OF THEM.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.000
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE
THEY EAT SOMETHING,

39:21.110 --> 39:24.625
WEAR CLOTHES.

39:24.740 --> 39:29.848
BUT THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT
THERE COMES A TIME WHEN

39:29.950 --> 39:32.737
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
LET THEM GO

39:32.850 --> 39:36.081
AND TRUST THEM

39:36.200 --> 39:39.784
AND KNOW THAT

39:39.890 --> 39:45.510
THEY CAN MAKE
GOOD DECISIONS.

39:45.620 --> 39:46.757
I OVERREACT ED,

39:46.860 --> 39:50.409
AND I'M SORRY,
AND I TRUST YOU.

39:50.520 --> 39:53.318
- WELL, THANKS.
[laughs]

39:53.420 --> 39:56.002
- AND YOU CAN SEE AMY.

39:56.110 --> 39:59.284
- I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO
JUST BRIBE ME WITH ICE CREAM.

39:59.390 --> 40:01.972
- LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THAT CHUNK!

40:02.080 --> 40:03.047
THAT IS MINE,
MY FRIEND.

40:03.150 --> 40:06.153
- YOU'VE GOT ALL
THE GOOD CHUNKS.

40:06.260 --> 40:07.158
- LOOK AT THAT!
YOU'RE JEALOUS?

40:07.260 --> 40:08.113
- UH-HUH.
YEAH, I WANT IT.

40:08.230 --> 40:11.017
[laughter]

40:37.020 --> 40:38.976
- CH ECKMATE.

40:39.090 --> 40:41.183
- CAN I MOVE HERE?

40:41.300 --> 40:44.531
- NO.

40:44.640 --> 40:48.849
- I USED TO BE AFRAID
OF YESTERDAY

40:48.960 --> 40:53.681
GOING ABOUT EVERYTHING
THE WRONG WAY

40:56.590 --> 40:58.103
- GOOD GAME.

40:58.210 --> 41:00.895
- AW, THAT WAS A GOOD GAME,
GRANDDAUGHTER.

41:01.010 --> 41:03.240
YOU DID GREAT!
THAT WAS FANTASTIC!

41:03.350 --> 41:04.931
- THAT WAS AWESOME.
- I'M EXHAUSTED.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.211
WHOA, JEEZ.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.311
- LET'S PLAY AGAIN.

41:08.430 --> 41:09.943
- I THINK
WE'RE GOOD WITH THIS.

41:10.050 --> 41:11.870
- WE'RE NOT GONNA
TOP THAT GAME.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.121
- I'M JUST, UH,
I'M GONNA GET THESE PACKAGES

41:22.230 --> 41:24.471
TO FEDEX BEFORE 5:00, SO...

41:24.580 --> 41:26.684
- YEAH.

41:30.210 --> 41:31.928
RACHEL?
- YEAH.

41:36.180 --> 41:40.549
[sighs]
I LOVE MY WIFE.

41:44.430 --> 41:46.011
- I KNOW.

41:46.120 --> 41:49.465
I KNOW THAT.

41:49.570 --> 41:51.947
SORRY.

42:22.780 --> 42:25.806
[folksy pop tune]
