WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.620
TELL ME WHAT YOU DON'T
LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF.

00:02.630 --> 00:03.665
MY EYES.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.888
MR. DEMPSEY, WHAT
EXACTLY DO YOU THINK

00:05.900 --> 00:07.128
IS WRONG WITH THEM?

00:07.140 --> 00:10.667
I'D LIKE THEM TO LOOK
MORE LIKE HERS.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.228
IT'S FOR
MY PARENTS, ACTUALLY.

00:15.240 --> 00:19.415
WE'RE VERY CLOSE,
AND THEY'RE, UM...

00:19.420 --> 00:21.069
TRADITIONAL?

00:21.080 --> 00:22.217
XENOPHOBIC.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.209
Kurt: HER MOTHER'S NISEI.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.346
SHE WAS BORN IN

00:24.350 --> 00:26.818
A JAPANESE-AMERICAN
INTERNMENT CAMP.

00:26.820 --> 00:27.809
HER FAMILY LOST EVERYTHING--

00:27.820 --> 00:29.048
THEIR HOME, THEIR BUSINESS,

00:29.060 --> 00:30.254
THEIR DIGNITY.

00:30.260 --> 00:31.659
SHE'S ALWAYS DISAPPROVED

00:31.660 --> 00:35.050
OF ANY MAN I WENT OUT WITH
WHO WASN'T JAPANESE.

00:35.060 --> 00:38.621
I JUST CAN'T TAKE
THE CHANCE THIS TIME...

00:41.100 --> 00:46.379
NOT WITH HIM.
NOT WHEN YOU FOUND THE ONE.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.371
Christian: MISS MORIATA,
IF HE'S THE ONE,

00:48.380 --> 00:49.847
WHY NOT ELOPE AND THEN

00:49.850 --> 00:50.976
INTRODUCE HIM
TO YOUR MOTHER?

00:50.980 --> 00:52.242
IT'S A LOT MORE
REASONABLE THAN

00:52.250 --> 00:54.514
ASKING YOUR FIANCE
TO REARRANGE HIS FACE.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.240
THE LAST MAN I WAS SERIOUS
ABOUT WAS ALSO WHITE.

00:58.250 --> 01:02.254
SHE SAID IF I MARRIED HIM,
I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

01:02.260 --> 01:05.525
OUR CHILDREN WILL
NEVER KNOW THEIR FAMILY.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.725
Kurt: I CAN'T LET LEIGH
MAKE THAT KIND OF SACRIFICE

01:07.730 --> 01:10.119
WHEN I CAN PREVENT IT
BY HAVING THIS OPERATION.

01:10.130 --> 01:12.291
IT ISN'T QUITE SO SIMPLE,
MR. DEMPSEY.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.528
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
THAT THE SURGERY,

01:13.540 --> 01:15.895
NO MATTER HOW GOOD
A JOB WE DO,

01:15.900 --> 01:17.868
IS GOING TO ADEQUATELY
CONVINCE LEE'S MOTHER

01:17.870 --> 01:19.007
THAT YOU'RE JAPANESE.

01:19.010 --> 01:21.103
I'D HATE FOR YOU
TO PUT YOURSELF

01:21.110 --> 01:22.805
THROUGH THE PAIN
AND TRAUMA OF AN OPERATION

01:22.810 --> 01:24.744
AND NOT HAVE IT COME OUT
THE WAY YOU'D LIKE IT TO.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.672
Christian: AND,
OF COURSE, THE PROCEDURE

01:26.680 --> 01:27.647
IS SOMEWHAT UNCOMMON.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.413
SO THERE WOULD BE
SOME EXTRA EXPENSE.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.945
Kurt: WHATEVER THE COST.

01:31.950 --> 01:33.156
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT IT.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.151
MY MIND'S MADE UP.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.129
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
LOVED SOMEONE SO MUCH

01:38.130 --> 01:40.291
THAT YOU'RE WILLING
TO DO ANYTHING

01:40.300 --> 01:43.098
TO KEEP
FROM LOSING THEM?

01:55.940 --> 01:58.602
Annie McNamara: MOM,
I CAN'T FIND MY PYRAMID.

01:58.610 --> 02:00.373
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU DID WITH IT.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.348
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
ANNIE.

02:02.350 --> 02:05.513
I'M JUST A LITTLE BUSY
AT THE MOMENT.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.348
[SIGHS]

02:23.540 --> 02:25.269
SHIT.

02:25.270 --> 02:29.570
SHIT, SHIT, SHIT.

02:29.580 --> 02:32.777
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
WARNER BROS.

02:43.260 --> 02:49.426
* MAKE ME BEAUTIFUL *

02:52.170 --> 02:56.539
* MAKE ME *

02:56.540 --> 02:59.373
* A PERFECT SOUL *

02:59.380 --> 03:02.304
* A PERFECT MIND *

03:02.310 --> 03:06.872
* A PERFECT FACE *

03:06.880 --> 03:11.715
* A PERFECT *

03:11.720 --> 03:13.779
*LIE*

03:15.820 --> 03:17.651
* TIME IS CHANGED,
ROLLIN' ARRANGED *

03:17.660 --> 03:19.696
* STEP OUTSIDE,
JUMP AROUND IN THE RAIN *

03:19.700 --> 03:22.260
* HARD TO SURVIVE
IN A LANE INTERCHANGE *

03:22.270 --> 03:23.760
* INTO THE SPOTLIGHT,
SWEET CANDY CANE *

03:23.770 --> 03:25.795
* LOVE HOW THE NIGHT LIGHTS
FLOW KINDA STRANGE *

03:25.800 --> 03:30.009
* 24 CARATS,
BOTH EARRINGS... *

03:30.010 --> 03:30.999
IT'S REAL.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.159
YES.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.478
YOU WEREN'T EVEN
LOOKING, WERE YOU?

03:33.480 --> 03:35.903
I HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.604
YOU KNOW,
WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY,

03:38.610 --> 03:40.043
THEY'VE GOT NO MODESTY.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.415
OH, GOD BLESS AMERICA.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.910
Serge:
YOU INTERESTED?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.217
ACTUALLY, I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING

03:44.220 --> 03:45.312
A LITTLE HIGHER
ON THE FOOD CHAIN.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.309
WHAT ABOUT YOU, VICTOR?

03:46.320 --> 03:47.582
OH, I'M THROUGH LOOKING.

03:47.590 --> 03:48.887
Christian: COME ON,
YOU'RE ONLY ENGAGED.

03:48.890 --> 03:50.221
MONOGAMY DOESN'T OFFICIALLY
GO INTO EFFECT

03:50.230 --> 03:51.481
UNTIL AFTER THE WEDDING.

03:51.490 --> 03:52.889
WELL, SUSANNAH DOESN'T
SEE IT THAT WAY.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.094
SUSANNAH WILL NEVER KNOW.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.089
Serge: YEAH,
SHE BLOODY WILL.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.465
SOON AS YOU COMMIT,

03:56.470 --> 03:57.459
IT DON'T MATTER
WHAT YOU WASH WITH,

03:57.470 --> 03:58.494
THEY SMELL
INFIDELITY ON YOU

03:58.500 --> 03:59.489
LIKE CAT PISS,
CAN'T THEY?

03:59.500 --> 04:00.899
Victor: SEE, I GET IT.

04:00.900 --> 04:01.969
2 OF YOU ARE JUST JEALOUS

04:01.970 --> 04:04.336
BECAUSE I GET ALL I WANT
WHENEVER I WANT IT.

04:04.340 --> 04:07.173
EVER NOTICE HOW MONOGAMY
RHYMES WITH MONOTONY?

04:07.180 --> 04:08.875
Victor: I FEEL SORRY
FOR YOU, MAN.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.677
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN IN LOVE.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.171
OF COURSE I HAVE.
IT'S THAT BEAUTIFUL MOMENT

04:13.180 --> 04:14.716
BETWEEN MEETING
THE WOMAN OF YOUR DREAMS

04:14.720 --> 04:16.312
AND SEEING
HER STRETCH MARKS.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.413
[LAUGHS]

04:18.420 --> 04:20.684
DOES SUSANNAH
GIVE YOU HEAD?

04:20.690 --> 04:22.214
ALL THE TIME.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.824
WELL, DON'T
GET TOO USED TO IT.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.628
ONCE YOU SAY, "I DO,"
THEY SAY, "I DON'T."

04:26.630 --> 04:29.258
UNTRUE. SOME OF THE BEST
BLOW JOBS I'VE HAD

04:29.260 --> 04:30.727
WERE FROM MARRIED WOMEN.

04:30.730 --> 04:32.129
Serge: AMERICANS DON'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF ORAL SEX.

04:32.130 --> 04:33.438
Victor: OK, HERE WE GO.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.795
SO EVERYTHING EUROPEAN
IS BETTER, RIGHT, SERGE?

04:35.800 --> 04:36.732
CIGARETTES? WINE?

04:36.740 --> 04:38.833
GERMAN WOMEN,
THEY'RE THE BEST.

04:38.840 --> 04:39.772
SPEAKING, OF COURSE,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.078
AS THE EXPERT
ON INTERNATIONAL HEAD.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.502
HAS TO DO
WITH THEIR ABILITY

04:43.510 --> 04:45.171
TO FOLLOW ORDERS.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.546
[LAUGHS]

04:48.580 --> 04:49.740
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN,

04:49.750 --> 04:52.617
BUT, UH, THAT POOR GIRL
LOOKS PARCHED.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.588
I'D BETTER BUY HER
A DRINK.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.751
DON'T YOU EVER
GET TIRED OF IT, MAN?

04:56.760 --> 04:59.024
THE WHOLE WHO-AM-I-GONNA-
LAY-TONIGHT SCENE?

04:59.030 --> 05:02.420
YES, VICTOR, I DO.
I GET ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.666
IT'S NOT JUST PEAS
AND CORN, PEOPLE.

05:07.670 --> 05:10.036
MENDEL AND McCLINTOCK
HAVE PROVIDED US

05:10.040 --> 05:11.302
WITH THE KEY
TO UNDERSTANDING

05:11.310 --> 05:13.778
HOW PHYSICAL APPEARANCE,
METABOLIC CAPACITY,

05:13.780 --> 05:15.634
AND INTELLIGENCE
ARE PASSED ON

05:15.640 --> 05:17.744
FROM PARENTS
TO OFFSPRING.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.718
OF COURSE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
INHERENT POTENTIAL,

05:19.720 --> 05:22.939
WHICH SOME ORGANISMS
MAY REACH,

05:22.950 --> 05:25.009
WHILE OTHERS WILL NOT.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.086
SOMEONE'S BEEN STUDYING,
I SEE.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.699
WELL, I GUESS I KNOW WHO

05:42.710 --> 05:44.530
I'LL BE SITTING NEXT TO
DURING THE MCATs.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.008
AH, BETTER PICK
SOMEONE ELSE.

05:47.010 --> 05:47.999
NO, LISTEN, I PROMISE

05:48.010 --> 05:48.806
I'LL ONLY COPY QUESTIONS

05:48.810 --> 05:50.778
ON MENDEL
AND McCLINTOCK.

05:50.780 --> 05:51.747
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:51.750 --> 05:53.149
WHY DON'T WE
DISCUSS IT OVER LUNCH?

05:53.150 --> 05:54.139
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO TANTRA?

05:54.150 --> 05:55.139
OH, JUDE, I'M--

05:55.150 --> 05:56.310
NO, IT'S GREAT.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.140
THEY GOT THIS MOVIE
OF THE KAMA SUTRA

05:58.150 --> 05:59.378
PLAYING IN
THE DINING ROOM.

05:59.390 --> 06:02.018
MMM, PERFECT PLACE
TO DISCUSS REPRODUCTION.

06:02.020 --> 06:06.628
LOOK, UH, JUDE,
I'M FLATTERED IN EVERY WAY.

06:06.630 --> 06:09.758
BUT YOU'D JUST BE
WASTING YOUR TIME.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.364
I'M PROBABLY NOT EVEN
GOING TO MED SCHOOL.

06:12.370 --> 06:13.439
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

06:13.440 --> 06:15.590
WITH ALL THAT
BEAUTY AND BRAINS?

06:15.600 --> 06:16.828
I DON'T KNOW.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.479
PASS THEM ON
TO MY OFFSPRING?

06:20.910 --> 06:22.878
Sean: APPARENTLY, SHE LEFT HIM
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

06:22.880 --> 06:23.949
Christian:
WELL, IF SHE LOOKED

06:23.950 --> 06:25.144
ANYTHING LIKE THIS,
HE PROBABLY

06:25.150 --> 06:26.378
PAID THE GUY
TO ABDUCT HER.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.018
WHAT WOULD
MAKE SOMEONE DO THIS?

06:28.020 --> 06:29.112
LOVE.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.386
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY DEEPLY
IN LOVE WITH...TOYOTA.

06:34.960 --> 06:35.881
Christian: LATOYA.

06:35.890 --> 06:37.619
THE BUTT CRACK'S
TOUGH TO READ.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.098
IT'S A SIGN OF COMMITMENT.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.250
MAYBE IT WAS HIS WAY
OF TELLING THE WORLD

06:42.260 --> 06:43.568
HE'D MET HIS SOULMATE.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.526
WHOM WE'RE NOW ABOUT
TO SCRAPE OFF HIS BACK

06:45.530 --> 06:46.531
ALONG WITH 2 LAYERS
OF SKIN

06:46.540 --> 06:48.167
DOWN TO THE DERMIS.

06:48.170 --> 06:49.569
YOU AND JULIA
LOVE EACH OTHER.

06:49.570 --> 06:51.333
I DON'T SEE YOU BRANDING
EACH OTHER'S NAMES

06:51.340 --> 06:53.433
ALL OVER YOUR BUTTS.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.509
THEN AGAIN,
I HAVEN'T SHOWERED

06:54.510 --> 06:55.772
WITH EITHER OF YOU
SINCE COLLEGE.

06:55.780 --> 06:58.101
WE DISCUSSED IT
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED.

06:58.110 --> 07:01.739
SHE THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY.

07:01.750 --> 07:02.910
I WOULD'VE DONE IT.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.787
I HAVE A TATTOO
ON MY RIGHT BREAST.

07:05.790 --> 07:08.350
2 FEMALE SYMBOLS
INTERTWINED.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.520
DOUBLE DYKES.

07:09.530 --> 07:13.523
I'M EXPRESSING
MY LESBIAN IDENTITY.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.620
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE A COUPLE

07:16.630 --> 07:17.699
WHO HAVE BEEN
WAITING AN HOUR.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.224
THEY WANT TO TALK
TO ONE OF YOU.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.630
YOU GO. I CAN DO THIS.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.529
SO CAN I. YOU GO.

07:26.270 --> 07:27.532
Grace: WELL, I NEED
ONE OF YOU.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.269
THEY'VE READ THE BROCHURE
SO MANY TIMES,

07:29.280 --> 07:31.703
TH EY'VE MEMORIZED IT.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.644
THINGS ARE NEVER
GONNA IMPROVE

07:33.650 --> 07:35.049
UNLESS YOU WORK ON THEM.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING.

07:35.050 --> 07:38.178
BELIEVE ME,
IF I WASN'T TRYING,

07:38.190 --> 07:39.953
SHE'D BE DEAD BY NOW.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.398
THE CAR WAS TOTALLED.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.731
PEOPLE WHO SAW
WHAT HAPPENED

07:57.740 --> 08:00.038
COULDN'T BELIEVE
I JUST WALKED AWAY.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.543
I JUST THANK GOD
SHE'S ALIVE.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.302
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'D MAKE IT WITHOUT HER.

08:04.310 --> 08:05.675
NOTHING ELSE BROKEN?

08:05.680 --> 08:08.808
NO, JUST MY NOSE.

08:08.820 --> 08:09.809
I SEE.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.812
Ellie: SINCE IT HAS
TO BE RESET ANWVAY,

08:12.820 --> 08:14.811
IF THAT IS
THE RIGHT EXPRESSION,

08:14.820 --> 08:16.287
I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD DO SOMETHING

08:16.290 --> 08:17.552
TO MAKE IT
A LITTLE CUTER.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.596
YOUR NOSE
COULDN'T BE ANY CUTER.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.953
Ellie: NEVER MIND HIM.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.427
I ALMOST HAD A ZIT THE SIZE
OF MOUNT SAINT HELENS

08:22.430 --> 08:24.193
THAT HE THOUGHT
WAS ADORABLE.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.758
HA HA HA!

08:25.770 --> 08:31.128
EXCUSE ME. AHEM. OK.

08:39.550 --> 08:41.245
LET'S SEE.

08:41.250 --> 08:47.109
WE COULD, UH, TAKE OFF
A LITTLE HERE, AND THEN--

08:47.120 --> 08:49.588
Grace: ANY OTHER SIDE EFFECTS
FROM THE ACCIDENT?

08:49.590 --> 08:51.649
DREAMS? INABILITY TO FOCUS?

08:51.660 --> 08:53.924
UNDUE FEAR? SLEEPLESSNESS?

08:53.930 --> 08:55.249
NO.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.592
OH, EXCUSE ME,
DR. SANTIAGO,

08:57.600 --> 08:59.363
I'D ASSUMED YOU'D
ASKED THESE QUESTIONS

08:59.370 --> 09:00.337
WHILE THEY WERE
WAITING FOR ME

09:00.340 --> 09:01.932
TO GET OUT OF SURGERY.

09:04.440 --> 09:07.034
I TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL TALK IT OVER

09:07.040 --> 09:09.031
WITH MY PARTNER,
DR. McNAMARA,

09:09.040 --> 09:12.976
AND WE'LL SCHEDULE YOU
FOR SURGERY, OK?

09:12.980 --> 09:14.277
OK.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.078
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE
TO ADD, DR. SANTIAGO?

09:17.090 --> 09:18.580
NOT A THING.

09:18.590 --> 09:19.818
EXCELLENT.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.220
THANK YOU, DR. TROY.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.926
MAKE SURE NURSE LINDA
GETS ALL YOUR INFORMATION.

09:26.930 --> 09:28.090
THIS WAY.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.295
THANK YOU.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.392
WELL, I SEE NO PROBLEM.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.697
AFTER A LIFE-THREATENING
ACCIDENT,

09:32.700 --> 09:34.531
