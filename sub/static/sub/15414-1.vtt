02:20.723 --> 02:26.020
Who could be ringing the
church bell at this time?

02:26.104 --> 02:29.065
Maybe it
ain't a who father

02:29.148 --> 02:31.818
maybe it's an it.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.695
And maybe it's
tolling the bell.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.239
Awe there's no such things

02:36.322 --> 02:37.865
as ghosts and monsters.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.784
Haven't I made
that clear to you?

02:39.867 --> 02:41.285
Something tore
the throats

02:41.369 --> 02:42.912
out of Charlie
Roches sheep

02:42.995 --> 02:44.831
and that something
didn't leave any tracks.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.333
Andy Trent here
saw a weird glow

02:47.416 --> 02:49.836
moving across the
marshes last night

02:49.919 --> 02:51.212
and this morning

02:51.295 --> 02:53.047
he found two of
his sheep dead.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.133
There throats torn open.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.176
Maybe the same thing
that killed Andy's sheep

02:57.260 --> 02:58.803
is tolling the bell.

02:58.886 --> 03:00.388
I was on my way just now

03:00.471 --> 03:02.140
to deliver a
special letter

03:02.223 --> 03:03.474
at Penrose Manor

03:03.558 --> 03:05.059
when a strange light

03:05.143 --> 03:07.603
appeared on the
road before me

03:07.645 --> 03:09.981
then moved quickly
across the marshes

03:10.064 --> 03:12.483
and faded into the mist.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.110
I turned the car around

03:14.193 --> 03:15.903
and hurried back here.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.321
It's not real.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.781
First the light

03:18.823 --> 03:20.283
and now the bell.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.909
There's a very sound
and logical reason

03:21.993 --> 03:23.786
for the bell
tolling at this time

03:23.870 --> 03:25.705
and I'm going to
find out what it is.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.415
You can drive me to
the church Potts.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.083
The letter can wait.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.626
No hurry.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.253
Nothing will harm you if
you're with the priest.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.880
Is that true Father?

03:33.963 --> 03:35.756
Awe what you
need is more faith

03:35.840 --> 03:37.508
and less imagination.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.719
Come along.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.150
I'd better deliver that
letter to the manor.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.527
I'm sure it's important.

04:37.693 --> 04:39.904
Thank goodness that
bell has stopped.

04:39.987 --> 04:42.698
Odd it's tolling at
this time of night.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.367
I don't like it.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.369
What with this phantom
around in the marshes.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.371
I saw it again tonight.

04:50.998 --> 04:53.292
Who would that be?

05:01.551 --> 05:03.010
Where's Lord Penrose?

05:03.094 --> 05:04.470
He's gone to Quebec.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.013
Get him on the
phone immediately.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.890
What's happened Father?

05:07.974 --> 05:10.017
Lady Penrose dead
clutching the bell rope,

05:10.059 --> 05:11.769
tolling for help.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.354
It was dreadful.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.939
Her ladyship.

05:15.022 --> 05:16.691
Call Sergeant Thompson
at the police station.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.693
Ask him to come to the
church immediately.

05:18.734 --> 05:20.361
Come with me Potts
I may need you.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.697
Yes Father.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.371
Operator put me
through to Quebec.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.915
Lord William Penrose.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.417
Yes.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.335
He's addressing a meeting

05:36.419 --> 05:38.129
of the Royal Canadian
Occult Society

05:38.212 --> 05:39.589
at a Quebec hotel.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.882
It's urgent sir.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.216
Page.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.634
Yes sir.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.136
Lord Penrose.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.846
La Morte Rouge is
on the telephone.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.681
It's urgent, he's
in the Gold Room.

05:48.764 --> 05:49.932
Yes sir.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.564
Gentlemen,

05:56.647 --> 05:58.065
as you know

05:58.107 --> 05:59.609
the greatest
obstacle in proving

05:59.692 --> 06:01.319
the authenticity
of the occult

06:01.402 --> 06:02.987
lies in finding facts.

06:03.070 --> 06:06.032
However, if the
facts are there

06:06.115 --> 06:08.451
even the most
harden skeptic,

06:08.534 --> 06:10.244
provided he
has an open mind,

06:10.328 --> 06:11.996
must finally acknowledge

06:12.079 --> 06:13.998
the actual existence
of the supernatural.

06:14.081 --> 06:16.292
Do you admit
that Mr. Holmes?

06:16.375 --> 06:18.961
Facts are always
convincing Lord Penrose.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.713
It's the conclusions
drawn from facts

06:20.797 --> 06:22.131
that are
frequently in error.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.883
Yes in the case of the
Hound of the Baskervilles,

06:23.966 --> 06:26.177
as well as the Adventure
of the Sussex Vampire,

06:26.260 --> 06:27.386
we found that...

06:27.470 --> 06:28.638
Watson please.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.181
Oh sorry.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.850
Well gentlemen this
time I have facts.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.435
Cold facts.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.104
Many years ago,

06:36.145 --> 06:37.897
one hundred to be exact,

06:37.980 --> 06:39.857
an apparition
appeared at night

06:39.941 --> 06:42.235
in the village now
called La Morte Rouge.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.569
The following morning

06:43.653 --> 06:44.987
three people
were found dead,

06:45.071 --> 06:46.531
their throats torn out.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.908
Hence the town's
rather a grime name.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.493
Interesting yes.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.870
But facts, no.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.914
I hardly think the tales

06:54.997 --> 06:56.624
of superstitious pheasants
can be considered...

06:56.707 --> 06:58.376
I haven't finished
Mr. Holmes.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.545
The La Morte Rouge has
again been the scene

07:00.628 --> 07:02.463
of these strange and
unexplainable occurrences.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.090
Unexplainable that is
from your point-of-view.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.842
Several of our most
responsible citizens

07:05.925 --> 07:07.718
have actually seen
the strange apparition

07:07.802 --> 07:09.345
on the marshes at night

07:09.428 --> 07:10.972
and next morning
sheep were discovered...

07:11.013 --> 07:12.515
With there
throats torn out

07:12.557 --> 07:14.267
and no traces of the
killer anywhere to be found.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.144
Oh you've read about
it in the papers?

07:16.185 --> 07:17.854
As a matter of
fact I haven't.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.689
It was a merely
a deduction.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.566
A rather obvious
one I'm afraid.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.317
Deductions are
a weakness of mine

07:23.359 --> 07:24.986
as Doctor Watson
can tell you.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.988
Would you believe
it, Holmes can...

07:27.029 --> 07:28.781
Well those are
facts Mr. Holmes.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.324
Ignore them if you can.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.993
But it's very urgent sir.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.661
Very well, go ahead.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.329
Thank you.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.331
I never ignore
facts Lord Penrose

07:37.373 --> 07:39.375
and I have no doubt that
the incident of the sheep

07:39.417 --> 07:41.502
with their throats torn out
is unquestionably a fact.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.213
However, the interpretation of this fact

07:44.297 --> 07:45.882
as being final proof
of the existence

07:45.965 --> 07:47.508
of the supernatural
is merely supposition

07:47.550 --> 07:49.552
and therefore cannot be
accepted without further data.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.596
Your opinions Mr. Holmes
are undoubtedly the result

07:51.679 --> 07:53.306
of your inability
to cope with something

07:53.389 --> 07:54.974
beyond the realm of
your comprehension.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.267
I say old man.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.728
I'm sorry John but this
ridiculous skepticism...

07:58.811 --> 08:00.229
yes what it is my boy?

08:00.313 --> 08:01.856
La Morte Rouge on
the telephone sir.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.191
Very urgent my Lord.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.318
Excuse me gentlemen.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.614
I'm afraid Lord...

08:09.697 --> 08:11.407
It's quite
understandable Sir John.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.409
Lord Penrose is deeply
entrenched in his beliefs.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.161
That's his privilege.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.746
Oh hang it all Holmes,

08:16.829 --> 08:18.539
the fellow was
positively rude.

08:18.581 --> 08:22.627
Well shall we see a
little overwrought Watson?

08:22.710 --> 08:25.046
I'm leaving immediately.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.844
Order my car at
once and hurry.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.179
Yes sir.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.977
Gentlemen, my wife has
just been found dead.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.563
Her throat torn out

08:42.605 --> 08:44.524
in exactly the same
manner as the sheep.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.067
This is terrible!

08:46.109 --> 08:47.110
I say you don't
think that it's...

08:47.193 --> 08:48.444
Undoubtedly Mr. Holmes

08:48.528 --> 08:50.071
you would call it murder

08:50.154 --> 08:51.656
by person or
persons unknown.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.241
I'm sorry, If I can
be of any assistance...

08:53.324 --> 08:54.659
Thank you, no.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.119
I'm afraid the happenings
in La Morte Rouge

08:56.160 --> 08:57.453
wouldn't interest
you Mr. Holmes.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.247
Under the circumstances

08:59.330 --> 09:00.915
I think we should adjourn.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.416
Yes indeed Sir John.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.168
Holmes what a
terrible thing.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.753
Uh Sir John would
you be good enough

09:05.795 --> 09:07.130
to convey our condolences
to Lord Penrose.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.172
Yes I'd be glad to.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.802
Say uh,

09:12.844 --> 09:14.929
can't we get something
to eat before we leave?

09:14.971 --> 09:16.973
We don't often get
food like you do here.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.474
Don't you think
of anything else

09:18.558 --> 09:19.892
besides your stomach?

09:19.976 --> 09:21.102
No not often.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.228
I think I'll get a paper.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.354
Good morning.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.605
Good morning sir.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.232
I imagine you'll be glad to
get back to London Mr. Holmes?

09:26.315 --> 09:27.442
Yes indeed.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.235
Oh by the way, there's
a letter for you sir.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.445
Thank you.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.155
Here's something
about Lady Penrose.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.865
She was found
in the church

09:33.948 --> 09:35.783
with her throat
horribly cut

09:35.867 --> 09:37.994
and then she dragged herself
from the marshes nearby

09:38.077 --> 09:41.289
and tried to summon
help with a bell rope.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.335
What is it Holmes?

09:46.377 --> 09:47.628
Listen to this Watson.

09:47.712 --> 09:48.963
What?

09:49.046 --> 09:50.298
My dearest of Holmes.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.716
I've every
reason to believe

09:51.799 --> 09:53.301
my life is in danger.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.969
Yet if you were to
ask me how I know

09:55.011 --> 09:57.096
I couldn't give you
a logical answer.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.514
There is nothing tangible,

09:58.598 --> 10:00.767
yet like a
terrible premonition

10:00.850 --> 10:03.436
it is also
frightfully real.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.146
I've heard of you
being in Quebec

10:05.188 --> 10:06.689
and I'm turning
to you, a stranger,

10:06.731 --> 10:08.316
and asking your help

10:08.357 --> 10:10.526
in the frantic hope
that you'll not fail me.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.904
Well whose it from?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.739
Signed Lillian Penrose.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.200
Lillian Pen... Lady Penrose?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.701
A letter from
the dead woman.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.203
What's it mean Holmes?

10:20.244 --> 10:21.996
I should say
that Lady Penrose

10:22.038 --> 10:23.915
lived in fear of her life.

10:23.998 --> 10:27.168
Some secret hidden in
her past in probability.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.836
Perhaps it isn't
as simple as that.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.214
What if Penrose is right?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.049
I'm glad we're going
back to London.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.009
Things like that can't
happen on Baker Street.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.677
Oh it's a pity Watson.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.430
Huh?

10:39.514 --> 10:40.932
Do you know a village

10:41.015 --> 10:42.558
by the name of
La Morte Rouge?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.060
Yes sir, it's about
twelve miles from here

10:44.102 --> 10:45.186
up towards the falls.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.354
Great Scott Holmes

10:46.395 --> 10:47.688
you mean you're going
to take on the case.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.898
Quite.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.108
Telephone the airport

10:50.191 --> 10:51.442
and cancel our
reservations will you?

10:51.526 --> 10:52.693
Certainly sir.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.320
Consider Watson the
irony, the tragic irony,

10:54.403 --> 10:55.947
that we accepted the
commission from the victim

10:56.030 --> 10:57.698
to find her murderer.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.075
For the first time

10:59.158 --> 11:01.994
we've been
retained by a corpse.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.377
Doesn't seem to be a bell.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.337
Never mind come along.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.381
Do you think we should?

11:33.276 --> 11:35.903
What a cold, cheerless
looking room.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.738
Yes.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.474
What do you want?

12:04.515 --> 12:05.808
Who are you?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.560
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

12:07.643 --> 12:10.563
I apologize for
this intrusion.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.443
Would you mind gentlemen?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.866
Mr. Holmes
is it your custom

12:21.949 --> 12:23.284
to burst into
people's houses

12:23.367 --> 12:24.702
without ringing the bell?

12:24.786 --> 12:26.204
We couldn't find
the bell sir.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.580
If you've come here

12:27.663 --> 12:29.457
to use the death of my
wife to prove your theories

12:29.540 --> 12:31.000
I must ask you to leave.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.919
Penrose, I
received this letter

12:33.002 --> 12:34.879
from Lady Penrose
this morning.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.677
I say that was
devilish awkward.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.939
I'm afraid you're a
little late Mr. Holmes,

12:53.022 --> 12:54.607
my wife's dead.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.109
And I've come here
to find her murderer.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.735
You might have saved
yourself the trouble.

12:57.819 --> 12:58.986
I'm convinced that

12:59.028 --> 13:00.488
the solution to
this horrible deed

13:00.530 --> 13:02.323
lies in an understanding
of psychic phenomenon.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.408
Although I don't expect you
to admit that Mr. Holmes.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.910
I assure you Penrose

13:05.993 --> 13:07.411
I neither believe
nor disbelieve

13:07.495 --> 13:08.955
in anything including
psychic phenomena.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.083
If I could just
see Lady Penrose

13:12.166 --> 13:14.335
it might help dispel
much of the mystery

13:14.377 --> 13:16.170
that surrounds these
happenings in La Morte Rouge.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.672
Drake!

13:17.713 --> 13:19.173
Why don't you answer
the blasted thing?

13:19.215 --> 13:20.842
Sergeant Thompson has
charge of the case.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.260
You'll find him
at the police station

13:22.343 --> 13:23.594
and now I must
ask you to go

13:23.678 --> 13:25.096
and take your
assistant with you.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.014
You'll excuse me if
I don't show you out.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.474
Drake?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.143
Drake?

13:30.226 --> 13:33.938
Drake where are you?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.982
Watson!

13:50.788 --> 13:52.373
Holmes I've
seen her before.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.875
Right Watson you have.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.376
Yes but where?

13:55.418 --> 13:56.752
Never mind that now

13:56.836 --> 13:58.296
we must examine
the wound

13:58.379 --> 13:59.797
before Penrose returns

13:59.881 --> 14:03.384
and has us thrown
out of the house.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.720
Clumsy job.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.889
Just missed her
jugular vein.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.432
She must have
bled to death.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.850
Must have bled for
several hours hey?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.310
Possibly more.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.853
Long enough for Penrose
to leave La Morte Rouge

14:13.936 --> 14:16.105
and reach Quebec in
time for the meeting?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.232
Holmes you don't
suspect Penrose?

14:18.316 --> 14:20.067
I suspect nobody Watson

14:20.109 --> 14:22.612
I was just
asking a question.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.284
I beg your
pardon gentlemen.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.247
There is another
who desired

14:33.289 --> 14:34.707
the death of her ladyship.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.584
I saw it last
night in the fields

14:36.667 --> 14:38.419
moving in and
out of the shadows.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.046
You're the butler
aren't you?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.631
I was the butler.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.216
I've given notice.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.764
Drake?

14:52.475 --> 14:53.643
Get out.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.436
Get out of this.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.778
I trust you found what
you're looking for?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.780
Two things have been
made clear to me Penrose.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.615
That you're
wife was murdered

15:07.698 --> 15:10.326
and that she's
Lillian Gentry.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.036
Lillian Gentry?

15:12.120 --> 15:13.788
Will you leave or must
I call the police?

15:13.871 --> 15:15.623
That will not
be necessary.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.960
We're on our way to
the police station now.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.964
The wounds found on
Lady Penrose's throat

15:23.047 --> 15:25.133
are identical with those
found on the throats

15:25.216 --> 15:27.009
of the dead sheep.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.470
Now I'm not a
superstitious man Mr. Holmes

15:29.512 --> 15:31.222
but I don't
know of any weapon

15:31.305 --> 15:33.141
capable of
inflicting such wounds

15:33.182 --> 15:34.976
except an animal's claw.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.769
Of course it
could be done

15:36.853 --> 15:38.604
by a five prong
garden weeder.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.315
Not that garden weeder
Mr. Holmes, that's mine.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.900
I use it to
weed the garden

15:42.984 --> 15:44.652
at the back of the jail.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.195
I'm inclined to agree
with the Sergeant, Holmes.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.822
A weapon such as that

15:47.864 --> 15:49.449
would of severed
the jugular vein.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.367
Death would have
followed immediately.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.827
Lady Penrose
lived long enough

15:52.869 --> 15:54.203
to drag herself
to the church

15:54.287 --> 15:55.705
and toll the bell

15:55.788 --> 15:57.331
in a frantic effort
to call for help.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.875
Yes, yes I know
all about that

15:58.916 --> 16:00.418
but there must be
some logical motive

16:00.501 --> 16:03.254
instead of all these
goblins and monsters.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.799
Sergeant have you ever
heard of a Lillian Gentry?

16:06.883 --> 16:08.217
No.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.219
No can't say that
I have Mr. Holmes.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.763
She was a famous actress

16:11.846 --> 16:13.514
who came to America
some time ago.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.183
She appeared
for many years

16:15.224 --> 16:16.768
in the
United States and Canada

16:16.851 --> 16:18.269
and then suddenly
she disappeared.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.687
Her disappearance
was never explained

16:19.771 --> 16:21.314
and she was
soon forgotten.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.982
But what's the
connection between

16:23.065 --> 16:24.650
Lillian Gentry's
disappearance

16:24.734 --> 16:27.069
and the death
of Lady Penrose?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.696
Lillian Gentry
and Lady Penrose

16:28.780 --> 16:30.448
are one in
the same person.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.866
The same person?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.075
Precisely.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.869
One more question
Sergeant.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.913
Do your files show anyone
with a prison record

16:36.996 --> 16:39.248
living in La Morte Rouge?

16:39.332 --> 16:40.833
No Mr. Holmes.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.668
The only person
having any connection

16:42.752 --> 16:44.796
with the prison
is Emile Journet.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.714
He came here two years
ago with his daughter

16:46.798 --> 16:48.633
and bought the hotel.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.218
He was a guard
at Talon Prison.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.594
Thank you Sergeant.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.012
I hear there are a
lot of prairie chicken

16:53.096 --> 16:54.555
in these parts.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.307
I'd like to have a
bang at them some day.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.226
I think that can
be arranged Doc.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.769
Yes we can stop
over at a farmyard

16:59.852 --> 17:01.646
and you can shoot all
the chickens you want.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.481
That's all very
funny Holmes.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.233
Here you are old fellow.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.901
We're going to
engage rooms

17:06.943 --> 17:07.859
of Monsieur
Journet's hotel.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.239
Landlord!

17:11.321 --> 17:13.782
I say landlord!

17:13.866 --> 17:15.201
Place seems deserted.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.786
Won't be for long if
you bellow like that.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.746
Land... oh sorry Holmes.

17:18.788 --> 17:23.041
Got to try and make some...

17:23.126 --> 17:24.335
Yes monsieur?

17:24.417 --> 17:25.752
My dear will you
rent a room for us?

17:25.837 --> 17:27.046
Yes monsieur.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.756
Good.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.091
Sign here please.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.300
I'll sign for us both.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.593
Oh thank you.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.429
You seem very young
to be in charge here.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.097
Yes monsieur.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.766
You a
Mademoiselle Journet?

17:38.808 --> 17:40.935
Marie Journet monsieur.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.270
My dear you've
been crying.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.646
Why?

17:43.729 --> 17:45.189
Papa's going away.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.316
Oh come now.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.734
That's the tragedy?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.153
Wouldn't you cry

17:50.236 --> 17:51.571
if you're papaw were
going away Watson?

17:51.654 --> 17:52.947
I don't believe I so.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.198
This way monsieur.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.616
Bring your bags.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.118
Yes of course.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.911
Wouldn't I be unhappy
if my father went away?

17:58.995 --> 18:01.122
Haven't seen my
father for years.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.416
Only died about
two years ago...

18:35.198 --> 18:37.658
Bills, bills, bills.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.285
That's the way
it goes Emile.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.995
It costs money to be born

18:41.078 --> 18:42.663
and it costs money to die.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.707
Do you know who
that was in the car?

18:44.749 --> 18:46.000
It was Sherlock Holmes.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.502
He's here now.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.920
What do you
think he'll find?

18:49.003 --> 18:50.296
Ghosts and monsters.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.839
What else is there
for him to find?

18:51.881 --> 18:55.927
I don't know.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.553
You're afraid Emile.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.097
Of course I am
and so are you.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.348
Who isn't?

19:00.389 --> 19:02.433
Why should Sherlock
Holmes come here?

19:02.517 --> 19:05.853
To investigate the death
of Lady Penrose what else?

19:05.895 --> 19:08.064
I'm afraid Mr. Holmes
will return to London

19:08.147 --> 19:10.191
a sadder but a wiser man.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.776
Why do you say that?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.528
Well you can't arrest
ghosts and monsters

19:13.611 --> 19:14.987
can you now?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.531
Well I'm on my way

19:16.572 --> 19:18.324
the mail must
be delivered.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.623
Much better.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.583
This room gives
me the creeps.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.335
It's very seldom
used, monsieur.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.878
It isn't often that

19:30.920 --> 19:32.463
strangers come
to La Morte Rouge

19:32.547 --> 19:33.923
and when they do
they never stay.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.424
I can't say that
I blame them.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.593
Will your father
be away for long?

19:37.677 --> 19:38.886
I don't know monsieur.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.054
When is he leaving?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.180
I don't know.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.598
Marie?

19:42.682 --> 19:46.269
If you need anything
just ring monsieur.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.062
That girl's
frightened Holmes.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.939
Obviously.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.357
She made the
mistake of telling us

19:51.441 --> 19:53.734
that her father
was leaving.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.904
You don't think
that Journet...

19:56.946 --> 19:58.990
Suppose we have a little
talk to Monsieur Journet,

19:59.073 --> 20:00.533
might prove illuminating.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.326
Didn't I tell you not
to answer any questions?

20:02.410 --> 20:03.453
Yes.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.454
Didn't I tell you

20:04.537 --> 20:06.080
to keep a silent
tongue in your mouth?

20:06.164 --> 20:07.582
Yes papaw.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.041
So you told them
I was going away?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.585
Yes papaw.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.211
That'll teach you to
keep your mouth shut.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.754
Uh Monsieur Journet,

20:13.796 --> 20:15.381
just why are you
leaving La Morte Rouge

20:15.465 --> 20:16.674
at this
particular time?

20:16.757 --> 20:18.342
I'm not leaving.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.802
What gave you the
idea that I was?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.304
Your daughter.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.014
My daughter's mistaken.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.183
I merely said that
I would like to go away.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.477
I've just been teaching
her the difference.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.061
Yes so I observed.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.480
I can't say that

20:30.563 --> 20:32.190
I approve of
your method sir.

20:32.273 --> 20:35.234
I'll ask you to mind
your own business.

20:35.318 --> 20:39.655
Run along dear.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.283
There there my dear.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.119
Disgraceful
hitting a child!

20:45.161 --> 20:46.454
Monsieur Journet's
quite right.

20:46.496 --> 20:49.081
It's none of our business.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.793
Monsieur Journet
what do you know

20:51.834 --> 20:53.628
of the death
of Lady Penrose?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.254
Only what everyone
in the village knows

20:55.338 --> 20:56.798
that she was killed
by the monster.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.382
Have you seen
this monster?

20:58.466 --> 21:00.968
No but who else could have
done this terrible thing?

21:01.052 --> 21:02.428
Sheep have been killed,

21:02.512 --> 21:04.722
their throats torn out.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.266
You were a jailer at
Talon Prison weren't you?

21:07.350 --> 21:09.644
Well yes monsieur.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.313
Why did you decide to
come to La Morte Rouge?

21:12.355 --> 21:15.441
Well I always wanted
to own a hotel

21:15.525 --> 21:17.985
and I heard this one was
for sale so I bought it.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.445
That was two years ago.

21:19.529 --> 21:20.863
Yes.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.615
I believe it
was about the time

21:22.698 --> 21:24.158
the monster made his
reappearance wasn't it?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.660
Do you suspect me

21:25.701 --> 21:26.994
of being the
monster Mr. Holmes?

21:27.036 --> 21:28.037
Oh no, no, no.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.039
I was just remarking
a coincidence.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.624
I thought you
didn't believe

21:31.707 --> 21:33.167
in those things Holmes.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.752
Quite right
Watson I don't.

21:34.836 --> 21:37.713
At least not in the
supernatural variety.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.382
Not the werewolf

21:39.465 --> 21:43.010
who bites into his victim's
throat with his teeth

21:43.094 --> 21:46.681
but a monster who uses

21:46.764 --> 21:48.391
for his weapon of death

21:48.474 --> 21:50.393
a five-prong
garden weeder,

21:50.476 --> 21:52.145
yes that's a little
more my line.

21:52.228 --> 21:55.273
I don't know
what you mean.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.817
I mean that this
monster's been recreated

21:57.900 --> 21:59.902
and used as a screen

21:59.986 --> 22:01.737
behind, which to
commit a horrible crime.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.406
Whoever did it felt
certain that no suspicion

22:03.489 --> 22:04.949
could possibly
fall on him?

22:05.032 --> 22:07.702
But my unexpected
arrival upset his plans.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.495
Very possibly he
became frightened,

22:09.579 --> 22:11.456
decided to run away.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.791
You're right masseur.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.918
I was running away

22:16.002 --> 22:17.712
but not for the
reason you think

22:17.753 --> 22:19.797
but in fear of my life.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.257
And who would
want to kill you?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.592
I don't know.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.051
It's like some
terrible premonition

22:24.093 --> 22:25.553
but it's so real.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.930
The very word that's in
Lady Penrose's letter.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.724
Yes.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.894
That still doesn't explain
this garden weeder.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.687
I swear to you

22:34.771 --> 22:36.939
I know nothing
about it's being here.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.524
Hadn't we better send

22:38.608 --> 22:40.401
for that fellow
Sergeant Thompson?

22:40.485 --> 22:42.361
No Watson that
won't be necessary.

22:42.445 --> 22:43.988
Monsieur Journet knows
as well as we do

22:44.071 --> 22:46.282
that you can't run
away from yourself.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.577
Oh would you be so good

22:49.619 --> 22:52.038
as to return this to
Sergeant Thompson monsieur?

22:52.121 --> 22:55.708
I took it away
quite by accident.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.632
Monsieur Journet
knows as well as we do

23:02.715 --> 23:04.967
you can't run
away from yourself.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.889
This fellow Journet seems
a very frightened chap.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.599
Do you think he
has any connection

23:11.682 --> 23:13.476
with Lady
Penrose's murder?

23:13.559 --> 23:15.686
Time will tell us
many things Watson.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.188
And now my dear fellow

23:17.271 --> 23:18.689
there's something you
can do for me if you will.

23:18.773 --> 23:20.066
Anything Holmes.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.692
I knew I could
rely on you.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.194
I want you to mingle

23:23.277 --> 23:24.695
with the people in
the café tonight.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.197
Find out all you can

23:26.280 --> 23:27.448
and keep a particularly
sharp eye on Journet.

23:27.532 --> 23:28.991
Sort of take
over the case.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.451
That's right oh boy.

23:30.535 --> 23:31.994
I want to get
a good night's rest

23:32.036 --> 23:33.621
before starting out
again in the morning.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.748
Oh and incidentally
make yourself

23:35.832 --> 23:37.667
as inconspicuous as
possible will you?

23:37.750 --> 23:39.293
Inconspicuous?

23:39.377 --> 23:42.046
You can depend on me.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.557
Oh thank you my dear.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.601
I'm glad to see that
the tears are all gone.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.019
Are you feeling better?

24:38.102 --> 24:39.353
Thanks to you
and Mr. Holmes,

24:39.437 --> 24:41.022
Papaw is not going away.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.482
Not going away?

24:42.565 --> 24:44.484
That's good.

24:48.446 --> 24:51.532
Journet not going away.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.159
There are many phases

24:53.242 --> 24:54.660
of the supernatural
Mr. Drake.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.329
Witchcraft, vampires,

24:56.412 --> 24:59.457
werewolves,
ghosts, monsters,

24:59.540 --> 25:02.376
you'll find them all
in the history of crime.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.253
So I say to myself

25:04.337 --> 25:10.343
Potts this is the handy
work of the supernatural.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.721
I gather that your
name is Potts

25:13.763 --> 25:16.099
and that you're interested
in the detection of crime.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.683
Allow me to
introduce myself.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.269
My name's Watson,
Doctor Watson

25:20.311 --> 25:22.438
of 221-B Baker Street,
London, England.

25:22.522 --> 25:23.940
How do you do sir?

25:24.023 --> 25:27.735
Here's to crime, bigger
and better crime.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.029
I deduce my good man that
you are somewhat drunk.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.406
Well sharp he is,

25:32.490 --> 25:34.909
sharp as a tack

25:34.951 --> 25:37.120
and just as flat headed.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.413
You might also deduce

25:39.497 --> 25:42.333
that I'm leaving
this place.

25:42.416 --> 25:46.003
Getting up and soon as
the bus I'm waiting for

25:46.087 --> 25:47.463
hoots it's hooter.

25:47.547 --> 25:50.299
I believe they say honks
its hooter in these parts.

25:50.383 --> 25:53.052
Hoots to me, honks to you.

25:53.136 --> 25:55.012
Hoot hoot.

25:55.096 --> 25:56.973
My dear fellow
I don't care two hoots

25:57.056 --> 25:59.183
whether it's hoot or honk.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.102
Oh that's my
bus gentlemen.

26:01.185 --> 26:06.816
I just heard it hoot
its hooter, distinctly.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.819
If you solve this
case let me know

26:09.902 --> 26:13.072
but personally I'm
betting on the monster.

26:13.156 --> 26:15.199
You take my advice Pottsy.

26:15.283 --> 26:16.742
Get out of this place

26:16.826 --> 26:21.038
before they find you
with your throat cut.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.003
Hoots,

26:27.086 --> 26:29.589
it's hooter.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.636
Nervous?

26:35.720 --> 26:37.388
Well the thought of having
your throat torn out

26:37.472 --> 26:39.182
by some monster
isn't likely

26:39.265 --> 26:40.975
to make you very
gay Doctor Watson.

26:41.017 --> 26:42.310
No indeed.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.728
Some of Monsieur Journet's
excellent wine

26:43.811 --> 26:45.271
will soon remedy that.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.856
Marie would you
bring a bottle

26:46.939 --> 26:48.733
of this excellent wine
for my friend here?

26:48.816 --> 26:50.943
Yes monsieur.

26:51.027 --> 26:53.571
Mr. Potts as a
student of the occult

26:53.654 --> 26:57.283
supposing you give me your
theory of this murder.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.827
Oh you'll like this wine.

26:59.911 --> 27:01.162
Oh but Doctor Watson

27:01.204 --> 27:03.372
I never drink anything
stronger than milk.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.832
Tea toddler?

27:04.916 --> 27:06.375
No hiccups.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.294
Every time I drink
alcohol I have hiccups.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.630
Oh sorry.

27:36.364 --> 27:38.908
Mr. Holmes.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.461
Mr. Holmes?

28:01.764 --> 28:03.850
This circle is where the
murder actually occurred.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.351
Yes Mr. Holmes.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.103
There's a footpath
just beyond the church,

28:07.186 --> 28:08.688
which leads
across the marshes

28:08.771 --> 28:10.606
follow it for half a
mile and you'll be there.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.191
Thank you Sergeant,
I'm sure I'll find it.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.110
Mr. Holmes I wish you'd
let me go with you.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.487
It's dangerous in
the marshes at night.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.698
These swamps,
the one false step...

28:18.781 --> 28:21.117
I'm sorry Sergeant but
it's important I go alone.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.577
I'll keep
close to the path.

28:22.660 --> 28:23.953
Well will Doctor Watson
be going with you?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.288
No Sergeant.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.081
I asked him to do some
research work of his own

28:27.165 --> 28:29.208
and by now he's probably
magnificently involved.

28:29.292 --> 28:30.710
Good night.

28:30.793 --> 28:33.087
Good night Mr. Holmes.

28:33.171 --> 28:35.965
But according to your
theory Doctor Watson,

28:36.048 --> 28:39.552
everyone in the village
is under suspicion.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.053
Pardon me.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.346
It's quite all right.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.806
Oh thank you.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.517
Murder is a very
interesting story gentlemen.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.895
I will recall
a short story

28:48.978 --> 28:51.939
by that brilliant
author G. K. Cheston

28:51.981 --> 28:56.152
in which the murder is
committed by a postman

28:56.235 --> 28:57.653
I refer of course

28:57.737 --> 28:59.280
to the invisible man.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.823
A brilliant
bit of deduction

29:00.865 --> 29:02.533
on the part
of Father Brown.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.160
I'm a postman.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.037
This is precisely
why I mentioned it

29:06.120 --> 29:08.080
to understate the
absurdity of assuming

29:08.164 --> 29:12.084
cause one man in the
postman's uniform is a murderer

29:12.168 --> 29:15.922
any other man in the same
uniform should be suspected.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.131
Thanks.

29:17.173 --> 29:18.674
Had me worried
for a minute.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.052
Well fiddle sticks.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.304
A child can see

29:23.346 --> 29:25.973
that this
ridiculous monster has...

29:26.057 --> 29:29.018
has got you all
afraid of your own shadow.

29:29.102 --> 29:31.521
I saw Lady Penrose.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.731
I wouldn't like it
to happen to me.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.483
I'll be getting on.

29:35.566 --> 29:37.985
I'm going with you.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.406
Good night Doctor.

29:42.490 --> 29:44.992
Good night.

29:45.076 --> 29:47.537
It's quite all right.

31:04.197 --> 31:08.910
Well what's so strange
about a church bell ring?

31:08.993 --> 31:12.747
It rang the same
time last night.

31:16.626 --> 31:17.919
Excuse me Doctor Watson,

31:17.960 --> 31:19.629
can you tell me if
Mr. Holmes is armed.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.589
Armed my dear fellow,
why should he be?

31:21.672 --> 31:23.049
He's gone to bed.

31:23.132 --> 31:24.467
Your wrong Doctor.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.927
He went out in
the marshes alone.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.637
I tried to go with
him but he refused.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.263
But Great Scott if he
runs into this monster

31:29.347 --> 31:30.556
and he's by himself

31:30.640 --> 31:32.433
he'll get killed!

32:53.931 --> 32:54.932
Holmes!

32:55.016 --> 32:56.100
Holmes!

32:56.184 --> 32:57.393
Are you all right?

32:57.477 --> 32:58.603
Where are you Watson?

32:58.686 --> 33:02.940
Here I am over
here Holmes.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.233
Watson where are you?

33:04.317 --> 33:05.818
I'm in the bog.

33:05.902 --> 33:07.236
Oh good gracious.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.529
Come here.

33:08.613 --> 33:10.156
You're instructions were
to mingle with the people

33:10.239 --> 33:11.532
and stay in the café.

33:11.616 --> 33:13.159
Sergeant Thompson said
you were out here alone

33:13.242 --> 33:14.535
so I thought you
might need help.

33:14.619 --> 33:16.412
Yes so you proceeded
to fall in the bog?

33:16.496 --> 33:17.789
Fall?

33:17.872 --> 33:19.290
I was pushed into
the blasted thing.

33:19.373 --> 33:20.958
Pushed by the most
ghastly apparition.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.336
Came at me like
a roaring furnace

33:23.419 --> 33:25.630
with spitting fire
in all directions.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.131
Before I could
get my revolver

33:27.215 --> 33:28.508
the thing was upon me.

33:28.591 --> 33:29.717
Well the next
thing I knew I was...

33:29.759 --> 33:30.885
I was in the bog.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.261
Are you all right
Mr. Holmes, I heard shots.

33:32.345 --> 33:33.805
Yes I'm all right but
Doctor Watson here

33:33.888 --> 33:35.181
seems to have
encountered the monster.

33:35.264 --> 33:36.390
He has?

33:36.474 --> 33:37.558
Come on old fellow

33:37.642 --> 33:38.851
we'd better get you
out of these wet clothes

33:38.935 --> 33:40.728
and into a hot tub before
he takes a death of cold.

33:50.238 --> 33:53.032
Now you've had
enough of that.

33:53.116 --> 33:54.534
Drink this.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.410
You'll be as fit as a
fiddle in the morning.

33:56.452 --> 33:57.912
Sorry you had
such a bad time.

33:57.954 --> 33:59.372
I've got a right to
share your dangers.

33:59.455 --> 34:00.623
Thanks old fellow.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.125
You know I wasn't sure

34:02.208 --> 34:03.543
that the villagers
weren't right

34:03.626 --> 34:04.961
and if it did
turn out to be

34:05.044 --> 34:06.421
some sort of
supernatural monster,

34:06.462 --> 34:07.880
well why should
I involve you?

34:07.964 --> 34:09.424
Rubbish.

34:09.465 --> 34:14.219
However, I did
learn something.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.764
I can now
state positively

34:16.806 --> 34:18.808
that our antagonist
is not a phantom.

34:18.850 --> 34:20.935
But the thing actually
spat flames at me.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.478
Oh just a figment
of your imagination.

34:23.521 --> 34:25.356
The murderer knew I was
out on the marshes

34:25.440 --> 34:27.190
and obviously wanted
to frighten me.

34:27.275 --> 34:28.943
He frightened
me all right.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.735
How did he
manage the flames?

34:30.820 --> 34:33.447
Merely clothing treated
with phosphorus.

34:33.531 --> 34:35.032
When the murderer fled

34:35.116 --> 34:37.034
his shirt caught on a tree

34:37.118 --> 34:39.286
and this piece of
cloth was torn off.

34:43.666 --> 34:45.208
Come in.

34:45.293 --> 34:49.922
I'd like a few words
with you Mr. Holmes.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.301
I'll come directly
to the point.

34:53.342 --> 34:54.677
Hello.

34:54.761 --> 34:56.554
What happened to
your assistant?

34:56.637 --> 34:57.889
I'm not his assistant.

34:57.972 --> 34:59.307
If you must know

34:59.348 --> 35:01.434
I was pushed into a
boggy hole on the marsh.

35:01.517 --> 35:02.977
Pushed?

35:03.060 --> 35:04.479
By whom?

35:04.520 --> 35:05.813
I don't know.

35:05.897 --> 35:07.356
Spat fire at me.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.816
My good sir,

35:08.858 --> 35:11.444
in spite of Mr. Holmes'
theories to the contrary

35:11.527 --> 35:13.529
things have been seen
and heard on those marshes

35:13.613 --> 35:14.906
that cannot
be explained away

35:14.989 --> 35:16.449
by the use of logic.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.034
If I were you I'd
keep away from them.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.285
I'm not so sure.

35:19.368 --> 35:20.661
Holmes found...

35:20.703 --> 35:22.371
Penrose, for
the first time

35:22.455 --> 35:24.540
in my long
pursuit of crime,

35:24.624 --> 35:26.626
I confess that
I find myself baffled.

35:26.709 --> 35:29.128
I'm a detective
I need tangible clues

35:29.212 --> 35:31.631
and up to now
I admit I found none.

35:31.714 --> 35:33.132
And you won't.

35:33.216 --> 35:35.343
I advise you to
leave La Morte Rouge.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.428
Tonight you escaped
with your life.

35:37.512 --> 35:40.473
Next time you may
not be so fortunate.

35:40.556 --> 35:43.351
Thank you for your considerate
advice Lord Penrose.

35:43.392 --> 35:44.644
Good night sir.

35:44.727 --> 35:47.522
Excuse me.

35:47.563 --> 35:51.776
Oh good night.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.694
I don't like that
fellow Holmes.

35:53.736 --> 35:55.613
Why do you think
he came here?

35:55.696 --> 35:58.324
He wanted to find out if
we discovered anything.

35:58.407 --> 36:01.702
He seemed very pleased
when I told him we hadn't.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.329
Now Watson there are
one or two questions

36:03.412 --> 36:05.206
I want to ask
Sergeant Thompson.

36:05.289 --> 36:07.250
You stay here.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.418
I have a very
important job for you.

36:09.502 --> 36:12.004
Anything Holmes, what
do you want me to do?

36:12.088 --> 36:13.881
Go to bed.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.510
Yes it's cotton fabric.

36:17.593 --> 36:19.929
Here take a look.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.389
That discoloration,

36:21.431 --> 36:23.683
the purple ink must
have been spilt on it.

36:23.766 --> 36:25.435
Possibly.

36:25.518 --> 36:28.354
I should say this cloth
was red with blue lines.

36:28.438 --> 36:31.023
Probably large checks

36:31.107 --> 36:32.525
and it seems to
have been laundered

36:32.608 --> 36:34.235
a good many times.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.237
The blues lines are
almost completely erased.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.114
Yes you can
scarcely see them.

36:38.197 --> 36:41.576
It's good fabric, well
woven, with a solid base.

36:41.617 --> 36:42.785
Hello Bill.

36:42.869 --> 36:44.829
Hello Sergeant, Your phone
call must be important

36:44.912 --> 36:46.330
to bring me over this
time of the night.

36:46.414 --> 36:47.874
It was, this is
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.625
He wants to ask you
a few questions.

36:49.709 --> 36:51.794
This is Mr. Taylor, the
storekeeper Mr. Holmes.

36:51.878 --> 36:53.171
Oh.

36:53.254 --> 36:54.422
Good evening
Monsieur Taylor.

36:54.464 --> 36:55.423
Good evening monsieur.

36:55.465 --> 36:56.924
Have you any shirts
of this design?

36:56.966 --> 36:58.468
Squares are red
and the lines blue.

36:58.509 --> 36:59.802
Yes I have.

36:59.886 --> 37:01.262
Can you remember to
whom you sold them?

37:01.304 --> 37:02.680
I can.

37:02.764 --> 37:04.182
I keep them in stock

37:04.265 --> 37:05.600
especially
for Judge Brisson.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.101
He won't have
anything else.

37:07.143 --> 37:08.394
Judge Brisson who's he?

37:08.478 --> 37:09.604
A retired magistrate.

37:09.687 --> 37:11.022
He's a cripple.

37:11.105 --> 37:12.565
Lives alone with
his housekeeper.

37:12.648 --> 37:14.150
Have you sold any of these
shirts to anyone else?

37:14.233 --> 37:15.651
No sir.

37:15.735 --> 37:17.278
They're too expensive for
the village and the boatmen.

37:17.361 --> 37:18.905
This is the finest
material imported.

37:18.988 --> 37:20.281
You say Judge
Brisson's a cripple?

37:20.323 --> 37:21.574
Yes.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.117
He was a
magistrate in Quebec.

37:23.201 --> 37:24.744
Had a stroke about
two years ago,

37:24.827 --> 37:26.412
that's why he
retired and came here

37:26.496 --> 37:28.039
to live in La Morte Rouge.

37:28.122 --> 37:30.458
Just about the time that
Monsieur Journet arrived here.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.960
Now that you mention it,
it was just about then.

37:36.923 --> 37:38.716
Hello operator?

37:38.800 --> 37:40.259
Give me Judge Brisson's
home will you?

37:40.343 --> 37:41.344
Thank you.

37:49.143 --> 37:51.687
Nora.

37:51.771 --> 37:54.232
Let it ring.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.234
Haven't I told you not to
answer the phone at night?

37:56.317 --> 37:57.735
Yes sir.

37:57.819 --> 37:59.529
Well then obey my orders.

37:59.612 --> 38:01.489
Yes sir.

38:08.579 --> 38:09.789
No answer.

38:09.872 --> 38:11.124
Where's he live?

38:11.207 --> 38:12.416
On the marsh road

38:12.500 --> 38:13.876
but I don't advise
you to go there

38:13.960 --> 38:15.378
after dark Mr. Holmes.

38:15.461 --> 38:16.879
The place is a fortress

38:16.963 --> 38:18.423
and guarded by
a savage dog.

38:18.506 --> 38:20.133
I think Doctor Watson
and I will have to

38:20.216 --> 38:21.843
pay Judge Brisson a
visit in the morning.

38:21.884 --> 38:22.885
Good night gentlemen.

38:22.969 --> 38:23.803
Good night Mr. Holmes.

38:31.894 --> 38:33.646
Two locks on the door,

38:33.729 --> 38:36.232
one of them new.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.818
Yes I should say that
Lady Penrose death

38:38.901 --> 38:41.112
has increased
Judge Brisson's terror.

38:41.195 --> 38:42.780
Don't like the
sound of that dog.

38:42.864 --> 38:44.574
Sounds hungry.

38:44.657 --> 38:46.367
Possibly ravenous.

38:46.409 --> 38:48.202
Could we come back after
he's had his breakfast?

38:48.286 --> 38:50.204
I'm sorry Watson our
business won't wait.

38:50.288 --> 38:52.707
Oh he's stop now.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.917
Yes Watson.

39:02.717 --> 39:03.718
Stop!

39:03.801 --> 39:04.761
Good Fido.

39:04.844 --> 39:05.595
Stop!

39:05.678 --> 39:06.637
Good Fido!

39:06.721 --> 39:08.514
Who is it?

39:08.598 --> 39:09.891
Sherlock Holmes
and Doctor Watson.

39:09.974 --> 39:11.267
I telephoned Judge
Brisson we were coming.

39:11.350 --> 39:12.727
You can't come in.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.312
He's given orders no
one is to be admitted.

39:14.395 --> 39:15.897
You wouldn't want
Judge Brisson's

39:15.980 --> 39:17.732
death on your
hands would you?

39:17.815 --> 39:19.192
No sir.

39:19.275 --> 39:21.402
Then you'd
better let us in.

39:21.444 --> 39:23.237
I'll probably lose
my job for this.

39:23.279 --> 39:25.990
Not after we've
talked to Judge Brisson.

39:29.285 --> 39:31.746
My good woman you, you
keep an eye on that dog.

39:31.788 --> 39:33.080
Oh don't worry Watson

39:33.122 --> 39:34.332
you know as well as I do

39:34.415 --> 39:35.833
the dog won't touch you

39:35.917 --> 39:37.251
if you're with its
master or mistress.

39:37.335 --> 39:38.586
Well you know
it and I know it

39:38.669 --> 39:40.588
but are you quite
sure the dog knows it?

39:40.630 --> 39:42.965
Good dog,
happy dog, good boy.

39:51.015 --> 39:52.892
Let me warn you I'm armed

39:52.975 --> 39:54.602
and I'm an expert shot.

39:54.644 --> 39:56.104
We didn't come here to
harm you Judge Brisson

39:56.145 --> 39:57.730
but to protect your life.

39:57.814 --> 39:59.941
I told you over the phone this
morning Mr. Sherlock Holmes

40:00.024 --> 40:01.609
that I did not
want to see you.

40:01.692 --> 40:03.069
I don't want
to see anyone.

40:03.152 --> 40:04.362
But I want to see you.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.906
Stay where you are!

40:06.989 --> 40:09.075
Nora show these men out.

40:09.158 --> 40:10.910
Judge Brisson if you'll
answer a few questions

40:10.993 --> 40:12.453
I maybe to save your life.

40:12.495 --> 40:13.996
I have the
fullest confidence

40:14.038 --> 40:16.374
in my own defenses and
I will not trade them

40:16.457 --> 40:19.293
for any theories of
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

40:19.335 --> 40:21.421
however plausible
you make them sound.

40:21.504 --> 40:22.797
Now get out will you?

40:22.880 --> 40:24.257
I'm sorry.

40:24.340 --> 40:25.800
Under the circumstances

40:25.842 --> 40:27.343
I'm helpless to
prevent your death,

40:27.427 --> 40:30.138
almost certainly
by violence.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.348
Come on Watson.

40:50.199 --> 40:51.367
Oh pardon me,

40:51.451 --> 40:52.827
may I trouble you
for that envelope?

40:52.910 --> 40:54.996
I must have dropped it.

40:59.250 --> 41:02.086
Thank you.

41:02.170 --> 41:03.713
You're a very
clever man Mr. Holmes.

41:03.796 --> 41:05.256
A crude device
Judge Brisson

41:05.339 --> 41:06.841
but it's confirmed
my suspicions

41:06.924 --> 41:09.469
that you're not the
cripple you pretend to be.

41:13.055 --> 41:16.392
I'm sorry but I'm
frightened of everything

41:16.476 --> 41:19.854
and everybody.

41:19.937 --> 41:21.439
Won't you sit down?

41:21.522 --> 41:22.815
You want to get
shot Holmes?

41:22.899 --> 41:26.944
Come in Watson and
close the door.

41:27.028 --> 41:28.488
Sit down old fellow,

41:28.571 --> 41:30.698
Judge Brisson has
decided not to shoot us.

41:30.782 --> 41:34.035
Oh that's very
kind of him.

41:34.076 --> 41:36.788
Gentlemen this fear
is driving me mad.

41:36.871 --> 41:38.206
It's quite understandable.

41:38.247 --> 41:39.832
The whole village seems
to be consumed with fear

41:39.916 --> 41:41.042
but in your case,

41:41.125 --> 41:42.752
judging from
your vicious dog,

41:42.835 --> 41:44.837
those bared windows
and that hunting rifle,

41:44.921 --> 41:46.255
it's not fear of
the supernatural.

41:46.339 --> 41:48.466
Just what are
you afraid of?

41:48.549 --> 41:51.636
Well truth is Mr. Holmes
I don't know

41:51.719 --> 41:54.764
and yet I feel
its very presence.

41:54.847 --> 41:56.474
At times I feel

41:56.557 --> 41:58.351
I can almost reach
out and touch it.

41:58.434 --> 42:00.353
When I first came
to La Morte Rouge

42:00.436 --> 42:02.105
I had a slight attack.

42:02.188 --> 42:04.690
It affected my legs but
well I've recovered.

42:04.774 --> 42:06.484
And you've
continued the deception

42:06.567 --> 42:08.152
using the
wheelchair as an excuse

42:08.236 --> 42:09.695
for not going
about the village?

42:09.779 --> 42:11.489
Oh you see people
would be more inclined

42:11.572 --> 42:13.533
to accept my
hermit like existence.

42:13.616 --> 42:14.742
Yes naturally.

42:14.784 --> 42:16.160
Tell me Judge Brisson

42:16.244 --> 42:17.870
had you ever heard
of Monsieur Journet

42:17.954 --> 42:19.914
before you arrived
at La Morte Rouge?

42:19.956 --> 42:21.290
No.

42:21.374 --> 42:22.500
No I hadn't.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.168
How many of these shirts

42:24.252 --> 42:26.337
has your housekeeper
purchased for you?

42:26.421 --> 42:29.507
Oh four or five
I'm not positive.

42:29.590 --> 42:31.008
You still have them?

42:31.092 --> 42:33.261
Oh one or two
became badly worn

42:33.302 --> 42:35.054
and I told me housekeeper

42:35.138 --> 42:37.014
to give them to a man

42:37.098 --> 42:39.016
who was doing some
work for me at that time.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.560
Can you describe him?

42:40.643 --> 42:42.812
No I'm afraid I can't.

42:42.895 --> 42:45.106
That was about
a year ago you see

42:45.189 --> 42:47.191
and well I didn't pay
much attention to him.

42:47.275 --> 42:48.609
He worked in the garden.

42:48.651 --> 42:50.236
Could your housekeeper
remember him?

42:50.319 --> 42:52.155
No that was a different
housekeeper then.

42:52.238 --> 42:53.781
She went to the
United States.

42:53.865 --> 42:55.533
Try to remember
Judge Brisson.

42:55.616 --> 43:00.079
Your life may
depend on it.

43:00.163 --> 43:01.956
I do remember one thing,

43:01.998 --> 43:03.708
he had a very slight limp.

43:03.791 --> 43:05.460
I used to watch
him from that window

43:05.543 --> 43:07.295
as he walked
across the lawn.

43:07.336 --> 43:10.047
Splendid.

43:10.131 --> 43:11.966
Continue your
vigilance Judge

43:12.008 --> 43:13.301
and under no circumstances

43:13.384 --> 43:14.886
allow anyone to
enter the house

43:14.969 --> 43:16.512
even someone you
may know well.

43:16.596 --> 43:17.972
Well what's that
mean Holmes?

43:18.014 --> 43:19.640
It may mean nothing and
it may mean everything.

43:19.724 --> 43:21.100
I'm quite sure that
Sergeant Thompson

43:21.184 --> 43:22.685
will have observed
a man with a limp

43:22.769 --> 43:24.353
in the village the
size of La Morte Rouge.

43:24.437 --> 43:25.730
Good day Judge
and thank you.

43:25.813 --> 43:30.151
Good day sir.

43:30.234 --> 43:31.778
I'm sure Sergeant Thompson

43:31.861 --> 43:33.780
will have observed
a man with a limp

43:33.863 --> 43:36.032
in a village the
size of La Morte Rouge.

43:44.624 --> 43:47.335
This is what's left of the
De Port Hotel Mr. Holmes.

43:47.376 --> 43:50.880
Tanner sleeps here when
he's in La Morte Rouge.

43:54.258 --> 43:55.927
Spooky old place.

43:56.010 --> 43:57.929
Villagers call it
the Wolf House.

43:58.012 --> 44:00.973
It's been
deserted for years.

44:07.230 --> 44:08.856
He walks with a limp,

44:08.940 --> 44:10.817
the left foot I think.

44:10.900 --> 44:12.276
To the trained
ear Sergeant

44:12.360 --> 44:14.028
footsteps of
catlaectic rhythm

44:14.070 --> 44:16.280
are as identifiable
as fingerprints.

44:42.432 --> 44:44.434
What do you want?

44:44.517 --> 44:46.018
We've come to have a
talk with you Tanner.

44:46.102 --> 44:47.603
I've done nothing.

44:47.687 --> 44:49.272
Then you won't mind
answering a few questions.

44:49.355 --> 44:51.023
What do you want to know?

44:51.107 --> 44:52.608
Tell me Tanner,

44:52.692 --> 44:54.318
where were you
two nights ago?

44:54.402 --> 44:55.903
Down the river.

44:55.987 --> 44:57.155
And last night.

44:57.238 --> 44:59.031
I just got back tonight.

44:59.115 --> 45:00.283
You're lying.

45:00.366 --> 45:02.452
You don't frighten me.

45:02.535 --> 45:07.540
And now I've
got a job to do.

45:07.623 --> 45:08.958
It's quite evident

45:09.041 --> 45:10.251
that you haven't
been on the river

45:10.334 --> 45:12.044
within the last
forty-eight hours.

45:12.128 --> 45:13.504
Are you trying
to make me out

45:13.588 --> 45:15.173
the murderer of
Lady Penrose?

45:15.256 --> 45:16.841
How'd do you know
she was murdered?

45:16.924 --> 45:18.593
I'll tell you how you
know she was murdered

45:18.634 --> 45:21.637
because you murdered her.

45:21.679 --> 45:24.390
Holmes look in
there the monster!

45:24.474 --> 45:25.892
That's right Watson.

45:25.975 --> 45:27.435
One of Brisson's shirts,

45:27.477 --> 45:29.187
which Tanner here
treated with phosphorus.

45:29.270 --> 45:30.730
Take him Sergeant.

45:30.813 --> 45:32.482
I'll give you all
the evidence later.

45:45.203 --> 45:46.245
You got him Sergeant.

45:46.329 --> 45:47.497
I'm sure of it.

45:47.580 --> 45:49.123
Come on.

46:32.041 --> 46:33.334
I see no reason why

46:33.418 --> 46:34.836
we shouldn't leave
for home tomorrow.

46:34.919 --> 46:36.671
So much for tomorrow
but for tonight

46:36.754 --> 46:38.297
what do you make
of this Watson?

46:38.381 --> 46:39.841
I found it in
Tanner's room.

46:39.882 --> 46:41.259
It's a photograph.

46:41.342 --> 46:42.677
That's right oh boy
just a photograph.

46:42.718 --> 46:44.011
You know something
else about it?

46:44.095 --> 46:45.346
Part of it's missing.

46:45.430 --> 46:46.681
Bravo Watson!

46:46.722 --> 46:48.099
Now if we can find
the missing half...

46:48.182 --> 46:49.475
notice the discoloration

46:49.559 --> 46:50.810
of the torn edge,
faded signature,

46:50.893 --> 46:52.228
the upper half
was torn off

46:52.311 --> 46:53.729
some time within the
last year I should say.

46:53.813 --> 46:55.565
Why all this fuss about
an old photograph?

46:55.648 --> 46:57.233
Watson have you ever
stopped to think

46:57.316 --> 46:58.818
that the science of
detection is very much

46:58.901 --> 47:00.403
like stringing a
hand full of beads?

47:00.486 --> 47:01.779
I can't say that I have.

47:01.863 --> 47:03.281
Well it is.

47:03.364 --> 47:04.657
And in this
particular case

47:04.740 --> 47:06.033
you might say that
I have five beads.

47:06.117 --> 47:07.618
Journet, Brisson, Tanner,
Lord and Lady Penrose.

47:07.702 --> 47:09.203
So far I haven't any thread
to string them together.

47:09.287 --> 47:11.080
This gentleman
is our thread

47:11.164 --> 47:13.541
and I think I shall
start with Lady Penrose.

47:13.583 --> 47:15.168
But Lady Penrose is dead.

47:15.251 --> 47:17.211
The dead can tell us
many things Sergeant.

47:17.253 --> 47:19.505
You and Doctor Watson
remain here at the hotel.

47:19.589 --> 47:21.424
I'll meet you later.

47:21.507 --> 47:23.885
I'm sure you got
Tanner, Sergeant

47:23.926 --> 47:26.637
but Mr. Holmes is never
satisfied with a dead criminal.

47:26.721 --> 47:28.890
He has to sit in
on the post-mortem.

47:28.973 --> 47:30.516
Come along, let's
go downstairs

47:30.600 --> 47:32.059
and celebrate the
death of the monster.

47:32.101 --> 47:34.270
That's a good idea Doctor.

48:19.107 --> 48:20.608
So the great
Sherlock Holmes

48:20.691 --> 48:24.695
becomes a common thief.

48:24.779 --> 48:26.114
You realize of course

48:26.155 --> 48:27.824
that I might
have shot you.

48:27.907 --> 48:30.159
I'd knew that you'd
refuse to see me

48:30.243 --> 48:32.328
so naturally I had
to take that chance.

48:32.411 --> 48:35.123
Tell me who is
Alistair Ramson?

48:35.206 --> 48:37.208
What does he to do
with your being here?

48:37.291 --> 48:40.503
Perhaps this will explain.

48:40.586 --> 48:42.797
Found the lower
half in a room

48:42.880 --> 48:45.133
occupied by a
boatman named Tanner.

48:45.216 --> 48:48.177
The upper half was in
Lady Penrose's safety box.

48:48.261 --> 48:50.388
Alistair Ramson
murdered a fellow actor

48:50.471 --> 48:52.723
in my wife's company.

48:55.184 --> 48:58.438
He was sentenced to
life in imprisonment.

48:58.521 --> 49:00.690
The whole thing was
a great shock to her.

49:00.773 --> 49:02.692
So she retired
from the stage

49:02.775 --> 49:04.318
and you married
her shortly after?

49:04.402 --> 49:06.404
Yes.

49:06.487 --> 49:09.657
Where and when was
this murder committed?

49:09.740 --> 49:11.784
In Quebec five years ago.

49:11.868 --> 49:13.578
Ramson was shot
three years later

49:13.661 --> 49:15.329
trying to escape
from Talon Prison.

49:15.413 --> 49:17.415
His body disappeared
in the Saint Lawrence.

49:17.498 --> 49:21.085
Was it ever recovered?

49:21.169 --> 49:22.837
I don't believe so.

49:22.920 --> 49:25.965
Penrose, Alistair
Ramson and Tanner

49:26.048 --> 49:27.508
are one in
the same person.

49:27.592 --> 49:28.843
What?

49:28.926 --> 49:30.845
It was he who sent the
upper half of that photograph

49:30.928 --> 49:32.430
to your wife as a warning.

49:32.513 --> 49:34.432
What could my wife have
in common with a murderer?

49:34.515 --> 49:36.058
Yet he killed her.

49:36.142 --> 49:37.393
He killed her?

49:37.477 --> 49:39.061
Yes.

49:39.145 --> 49:42.231
The monster was none
other than Tanner himself.

49:42.315 --> 49:45.026
We found a shirt impregnated
with phosphorus in his room.

49:45.067 --> 49:47.069
Tonight when we faced him
with the evidence of his crime

49:47.111 --> 49:48.988
he bolted and jumped
out of the window

49:49.071 --> 49:50.782
into the river.

49:50.865 --> 49:53.075
Sergeant Thompson fired
a couple of shots at him.

49:53.159 --> 49:55.453
He's dead?

49:55.536 --> 49:58.289
In a way, yes.

49:58.372 --> 50:00.708
I don't understand.

50:00.750 --> 50:03.252
Tanner is dead only
because he was discovered

50:03.336 --> 50:05.088
and therefore have
outlived his usefulness

50:05.171 --> 50:06.547
to his creator.

50:06.589 --> 50:08.424
But I'm afraid that
Alistair Ramson, the actor,

50:08.508 --> 50:10.510
who created and played
the part of Tanner,

50:10.593 --> 50:12.220
is very much alive.

50:12.261 --> 50:14.222
But surely now
that you know

50:14.263 --> 50:15.723
who the murderer
is the police...

50:15.765 --> 50:17.058
It's not quite as
simple as that.

50:17.100 --> 50:18.684
During the time
he's lived here

50:18.768 --> 50:20.478
Ramson has undoubtedly

50:20.561 --> 50:22.480
established another
character for himself.

50:22.563 --> 50:24.023
Perhaps several others.

50:24.107 --> 50:25.608
For by now familiar

50:25.691 --> 50:27.026
to the people of the
town La Morte Rouge

50:27.110 --> 50:28.402
and quite above suspicion.

50:28.486 --> 50:30.947
He could be almost
anyone in the village.

50:31.030 --> 50:34.575
He may even have been
your butler, Drake.

50:34.659 --> 50:36.202
This is fantastic.

50:36.285 --> 50:37.703
Yes.

50:37.787 --> 50:39.747
If Lady Penrose's death
is only the beginning

50:39.831 --> 50:41.290
there's no saying where

50:41.374 --> 50:43.084
this madman
will strike next.

50:43.167 --> 50:45.503
Tell me is there anyone
else in La Morte Rouge

50:45.586 --> 50:47.171
who may have been
connected in anyway

50:47.255 --> 50:50.425
with the case of
Alistair Ramson?

50:50.466 --> 50:52.468
Judge Brisson
was the magistrate

50:52.510 --> 50:55.263
who tried and
sentenced him.

51:00.184 --> 51:02.645
Operator,

51:02.728 --> 51:03.980
operator,

51:04.063 --> 51:05.398
give me
Judge Brisson's home.

51:05.481 --> 51:07.066
It's urgent.

51:11.362 --> 51:13.739
Judge Brisson this
is Sherlock Holmes.

51:13.823 --> 51:16.868
Oh yes Mr. Holmes.

51:16.951 --> 51:19.495
Oh I'm quite all
right, thank you.

51:19.579 --> 51:21.456
I've chained up the
dog as you asked.

51:21.497 --> 51:23.583
As I asked?

51:23.666 --> 51:25.460
I haven't telephoned
you before.

51:25.543 --> 51:27.295
Somebody's obviously
imitated my voice

51:27.378 --> 51:30.882
in order to gain
access to the house.

51:30.965 --> 51:33.134
Oh certainly Mr. Holmes.

51:33.217 --> 51:35.052
I'll lock all the doors

51:35.136 --> 51:36.679
and await your arrival.

51:36.763 --> 51:38.681
Yes.

51:43.686 --> 51:45.188
Nora?

51:45.271 --> 51:46.731
Nora?

51:46.814 --> 51:48.149
If I can be of any
assistance Mr. Holmes.

51:48.191 --> 51:49.275
Thank you but I'm afraid.

51:49.358 --> 51:50.735
You think Judge Brissons
life's in danger?

51:50.818 --> 51:52.028
I only hope I'm in time

51:52.111 --> 51:53.571
to prevent
a second murder.

52:27.271 --> 52:28.481
That's Mr. Holmes.

52:28.564 --> 52:30.566
Show him in.

52:42.245 --> 52:44.205
Hurry up.

52:56.551 --> 52:59.554
Judge Brisson!

52:59.637 --> 53:02.014
Judge Brisson!

53:49.061 --> 53:50.688
Nora!

53:50.772 --> 53:52.607
Nora!

53:58.988 --> 54:02.241
Nora!

54:02.325 --> 54:04.243
Nora!

54:29.685 --> 54:31.479
Do you know who it was?

54:31.562 --> 54:33.147
I don't know.

54:33.231 --> 54:35.399
I don't know!

54:42.115 --> 54:43.533
Hello.

54:43.616 --> 54:45.451
Operator, Monsieur
Journet's café.

54:45.493 --> 54:46.911
I want to speak to
Sergeant Thompson.

54:46.994 --> 54:49.622
It's urgent.

54:54.043 --> 54:55.837
Sergeant Thompson this
is Sherlock Holmes.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.213
I'm at Judge Brisson's.

54:57.296 --> 54:58.756
He's been murdered.

54:58.840 --> 55:00.133
Judge Brisson's
been murdered.

55:00.216 --> 55:01.551
Judge Brisson?

55:01.634 --> 55:03.136
The murderer gained
access to the house,

55:03.219 --> 55:04.679
gagged and bound
the housekeeper,

55:04.762 --> 55:06.472
then disguised as Nora,
murdered Judge Brisson.

55:06.514 --> 55:08.015
I'm returning to the
Old Della Port Hotel

55:08.099 --> 55:10.143
on the chance
that he'll go there

55:10.226 --> 55:12.145
to change his clothes and
assume another disguise.

55:12.228 --> 55:13.688
Ask Doctor Watson
to meet me there

55:13.771 --> 55:15.273
as quickly as
you can will you?

55:15.356 --> 55:16.858
You'd better come here
and once and take charge.

55:16.941 --> 55:18.693
Right.

56:43.861 --> 56:46.322
Throw your revolver on
the floor in front of you

56:46.405 --> 56:49.492
and raise your hands
Sherlock Holmes.

56:53.663 --> 56:55.248
I should have thought

56:55.331 --> 56:57.125
you would have felt more
at home in the spotlight.

56:57.208 --> 57:00.753
I see you've finally
identified me.

57:00.837 --> 57:02.672
Your Jack Tanner and
Nora the housekeeper

57:02.755 --> 57:04.465
were brilliant.

57:04.549 --> 57:06.092
You should really
take a bow.

57:06.175 --> 57:09.387
It's too bad you appeared
on the scene when you did

57:09.470 --> 57:11.514
and I had to bring
down the curtain

57:11.597 --> 57:13.141
on the monster.

57:13.224 --> 57:15.143
Your recreation of the
monster of La Morte Rouge

57:15.184 --> 57:17.103
as a means of murder.

57:17.186 --> 57:18.980
Must have given you
great satisfaction.

57:19.021 --> 57:20.606
Why did you kill
Lady Penrose?

57:20.648 --> 57:23.693
I see know reason why
I shouldn't tell you.

57:23.776 --> 57:25.361
I couldn't
bear the thought

57:25.445 --> 57:27.280
of another man
possessing her.

57:27.363 --> 57:28.823
And Judge Brisson?

57:28.865 --> 57:32.368
During the trial
I grew to hate him

57:32.452 --> 57:34.454
and when he
sentenced me to prison

57:34.537 --> 57:36.414
I vowed that someday

57:36.497 --> 57:38.583
I would escape
and kill him.

57:38.666 --> 57:40.501
I see.

57:40.543 --> 57:42.628
Obviously you planned
still another murder,

57:42.670 --> 57:44.297
otherwise you would have

57:44.380 --> 57:46.090
returned to the safety
of your first disguise

57:46.174 --> 57:46.966
and defied me to find you.

57:47.049 --> 57:49.469
You're right, I am.

57:49.552 --> 57:51.179
There was three
people in my life

57:51.220 --> 57:53.556
who had no right to live.

57:53.639 --> 57:56.017
Two have already died.

57:56.058 --> 57:58.478
The third remains.

57:58.561 --> 58:03.858
Tonight I shall kill him.

58:03.900 --> 58:06.736
Mr. Holmes
I've always had

58:06.819 --> 58:09.280
the greatest admiration
for your talents.

58:09.363 --> 58:10.782
Thank you.

58:10.865 --> 58:12.366
Your performance
in this case

58:12.450 --> 58:14.952
has also been brilliant.

58:15.036 --> 58:16.746
So brilliant
that I'm afraid

58:16.829 --> 58:18.372
I'm going to have to

58:18.456 --> 58:21.834
bring down the curtain
on it a bit prematurely.

58:23.628 --> 58:25.004
Uh Mr. Ramson?

58:25.088 --> 58:27.215
We are artists
in our fashion,

58:27.298 --> 58:29.550
not creatures
skulking in allies.

58:29.592 --> 58:32.178
If our positions
were reversed

58:32.261 --> 58:34.722
I shouldn't think of you
sending to your death.

58:34.764 --> 58:37.308
Lacking a few stray
pieces of the puzzle.

58:37.391 --> 58:39.644
What do you want to know?

58:39.727 --> 58:41.395
The name of the
third person.

58:41.437 --> 58:43.606
I have no objection.

58:43.689 --> 58:45.942
If there is a hereafter,

58:46.025 --> 58:47.777
which I doubt,

58:47.860 --> 58:51.322
you and he will meet
very soon Mr. Holmes.

58:51.405 --> 58:54.283
The name of the
third person is...

59:08.923 --> 59:10.049
Coming Holmes.

59:10.133 --> 59:12.009
Look out Watson!

59:21.060 --> 59:22.478
All right Watson.

59:22.562 --> 59:23.604
Where is he Holmes?

59:23.688 --> 59:25.898
He's gone.

59:25.940 --> 59:27.608
Thank heavens your safe.

59:27.650 --> 59:30.611
Thank heaven you
came when you did.

59:30.695 --> 59:32.572
Here it is Watson.

59:32.655 --> 59:33.781
Look out.

59:42.081 --> 59:43.291
He got away again.

59:43.332 --> 59:44.500
Yes Watson.

59:44.584 --> 59:48.004
Over that warehouse
roof most probably.

59:48.087 --> 59:49.964
What a room.

59:50.006 --> 59:51.632
Yes.

59:51.716 --> 59:53.468
This is obviously
the secret room

59:53.509 --> 59:56.262
where his disguises
were created.

59:56.345 --> 59:57.972
Looks like an actor's
dressing room.

59:58.014 --> 59:59.474
He is an actor Watson.

59:59.557 --> 01:00:00.975
One of the finest acting
talents of our time.

01:00:01.017 --> 01:00:02.351
Look at this.

01:00:02.435 --> 01:00:03.936
Nora the housekeeper.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.396
His name's
Alistair Ramson.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.647
Alistair Ramson?

01:00:06.689 --> 01:00:07.982
Never heard of him.

01:00:08.065 --> 01:00:09.400
Well it's not important.

01:00:09.484 --> 01:00:10.818
The important thing is

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.361
that he murdered Lady
Penrose and Judge Brisson.

01:00:12.445 --> 01:00:13.780
Great Scott he did!

01:00:13.821 --> 01:00:15.323
Yes Watson.

01:00:15.364 --> 01:00:17.033
This Ramson is
a paranoiac.

01:00:17.116 --> 01:00:18.826
His orgy of crime
is not complete.

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:20.745
There's still another.

01:00:20.828 --> 01:00:22.330
I was just about
to learn his name

01:00:22.413 --> 01:00:24.624
when you so conveniently
fell down the stairs.

01:00:24.707 --> 01:00:25.833
So sorry oh chap.

01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:27.210
Easy you old boy.

01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:29.879
You saved my life.

01:00:29.962 --> 01:00:31.297
Look at this Watson.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.465
Tanner.

01:00:32.548 --> 01:00:33.841
Tanner?

01:00:33.883 --> 01:00:35.676
Where do you think
he'll strike next?

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.637
Obviously Journet is
to be his third victim.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.846
Journet?

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:40.056
Yes Watson.

01:00:40.139 --> 01:00:42.225
As in the cases of Lady
Penrose and Judge Brisson,

01:00:42.308 --> 01:00:44.018
Journet also
holds his presence

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.145
but in each case it was
vague and unexplainable.

01:00:46.187 --> 01:00:47.814
Oh what connection
can he have

01:00:47.855 --> 01:00:49.649
with Judge Brisson
and Lady Penrose?

01:00:49.732 --> 01:00:51.359
Journet was a guard
at Talon Prison

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.902
where Alistair Ramson
was confined.

01:00:52.985 --> 01:00:54.570
He's the third person

01:00:54.654 --> 01:00:56.155
against whom the murderer
holds a grievance.

01:00:56.239 --> 01:00:57.615
Now he's disappeared.

01:00:57.698 --> 01:00:59.158
Journet disappeared?

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.160
Oh so Marie told
us in the café.

01:01:01.202 --> 01:01:03.037
Watson, Journet's
disappearance

01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:04.497
could mean only one thing.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:05.873
He's in hiding.

01:01:05.957 --> 01:01:08.042
Our job is to find him
before Ramson does.

01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:09.669
Journet's the only man

01:01:09.752 --> 01:01:11.587
who can lead us
to the murderer.

01:01:11.671 --> 01:01:13.589
We better have a
talk with Marie.

01:01:36.821 --> 01:01:39.157
Hello Potts have
you seen Marie?

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.533
No.

01:01:40.616 --> 01:01:42.160
Have you seen her?

01:01:42.243 --> 01:01:44.412
Can't say I have.

01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:56.048
Marie?

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:57.592
Watson.

01:02:07.268 --> 01:02:09.520
What is it Holmes?

01:02:09.604 --> 01:02:11.856
I'm afraid we're to late.

01:02:14.108 --> 01:02:16.068
Marie.

01:02:20.448 --> 01:02:23.117
Don't touch
anything Watson.

01:02:25.828 --> 01:02:27.413
Murdered in
exactly the same way

01:02:27.455 --> 01:02:30.458
as Judge Brisson
and Lady Penrose.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.794
Poor innocent
little child.

01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:34.545
I should have
prevented this.

01:02:34.629 --> 01:02:36.297
Nonsense my dear chap.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:37.965
You did
everything possible.

01:02:38.049 --> 01:02:40.218
How on Earth could
you have prevented it?

01:02:40.301 --> 01:02:44.639
The child's death is
a tragedy of course.

01:02:44.722 --> 01:02:47.058
I see exactly
what happened.

01:02:47.141 --> 01:02:49.977
She was standing here
by the desk and the...

01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:51.979
the murderer came
in by that door.

01:02:52.063 --> 01:02:53.481
He came in
through that door

01:02:53.564 --> 01:02:55.108
but Marie was
not in the room.

01:02:55.149 --> 01:02:56.984
She alone of all
people in the café

01:02:57.026 --> 01:02:58.820
saw Ramson
into this office.

01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:00.780
He was someone
she knew well.

01:03:00.863 --> 01:03:03.157
Someone who might have a
message from her father

01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:05.284
so she followed him here.

01:03:05.368 --> 01:03:07.829
And when she
refused to tell him

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:10.081
where her father had
gone he killed her.

01:03:10.164 --> 01:03:12.250
Ramson already knew
that Journet disappeared

01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:15.002
but did he know where?

01:03:15.086 --> 01:03:16.379
When he questioned her

01:03:16.462 --> 01:03:18.131
she became suspicious

01:03:18.172 --> 01:03:21.801
and it was then
that he killed her.

01:03:21.884 --> 01:03:23.553
Telephone Sergeant
Thompson will you?

01:03:23.636 --> 01:03:24.929
He's at Judge Brisson's,

01:03:25.012 --> 01:03:26.514
ask him to
come here at once

01:03:26.597 --> 01:03:28.057
and see that no one
leaves the café

01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:29.684
until he gets here.

01:03:29.767 --> 01:03:31.686
The murderer may
be among them.

01:03:43.948 --> 01:03:45.575
What could have
happened to Holmes?

01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:47.160
He's been away all day.

01:03:47.201 --> 01:03:48.619
It's very unfair of him

01:03:48.703 --> 01:03:50.163
keeping me in
suspense like this.

01:03:50.246 --> 01:03:51.873
He knows how
worried I become.

01:03:51.956 --> 01:03:53.207
He continues to do it

01:03:53.249 --> 01:03:54.876
and do you know why?

01:03:54.959 --> 01:03:58.463
He actually enjoys
making me miserable.

01:03:58.546 --> 01:04:00.882
Half a mo!

01:04:11.934 --> 01:04:13.394
No good Watson
it won't work.

01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:15.688
What won't work?

01:04:15.772 --> 01:04:17.190
I've been to every place

01:04:17.231 --> 01:04:18.816
where Journet could
possibly be in hiding.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.401
Oh so that's where
you've been all day.

01:04:20.485 --> 01:04:21.903
Yes Watson and
I must admit

01:04:21.944 --> 01:04:23.404
that I'm
completely baffled.

01:04:23.446 --> 01:04:25.156
You got to find Journet
before it's too late.

01:04:25.239 --> 01:04:26.616
But how?

01:04:26.699 --> 01:04:28.076
I've been everywhere

01:04:28.117 --> 01:04:29.535
within a radius of five
miles of this village.

01:04:29.577 --> 01:04:31.162
I've even been
to the church

01:04:31.245 --> 01:04:32.705
in the hope that
he'd disguise himself

01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:34.123
and attend mass.

01:04:34.207 --> 01:04:35.583
He may have
gone to Quebec.

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:37.043
Every road's covered.

01:04:37.085 --> 01:04:39.212
He hasn't left this
vicinity, of that I'm certain.

01:04:39.295 --> 01:04:42.006
All right I'll answer it.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.424
Hello.

01:04:43.508 --> 01:04:45.009
Hello.

01:04:53.893 --> 01:04:55.311
Who was it Holmes?

01:04:55.394 --> 01:04:57.313
Watson, get your
hat and coat.

01:04:57.396 --> 01:04:58.731
Your very rude Holmes.

01:04:58.815 --> 01:05:00.274
You leave me all day long

01:05:00.316 --> 01:05:01.943
with that very
dull inspector.

01:05:02.026 --> 01:05:03.528
I ask you a
perfectly fine question

01:05:03.611 --> 01:05:05.238
and all you say is "Watson,
get your hat and coat."

01:05:05.279 --> 01:05:06.614
Were going to
find Journet.

01:05:06.656 --> 01:05:07.949
Sergeant you wait
here till I call.

01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:09.700
Watson do this,
Watson do that.

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:11.452
Watson get your
hat and coat.

01:05:13.287 --> 01:05:15.164
Brissons house.

01:05:15.248 --> 01:05:16.749
It's my opinion that
Judge Brisson's house

01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.459
is the last place
that you'll find Journet.

01:05:18.501 --> 01:05:20.169
Put yourself in Journet's
position Watson.

01:05:20.253 --> 01:05:21.796
Where's the
most likely place

01:05:21.879 --> 01:05:23.423
that Ramson
would look for you?

01:05:23.506 --> 01:05:24.882
Certainly not in
the very house

01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:27.802
in which he's just
killed one of his victims.

01:05:32.974 --> 01:05:34.267
Journet?

01:05:34.308 --> 01:05:35.643
Journet?

01:05:35.685 --> 01:05:37.687
It's Sherlock Holmes
and Doctor Watson

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:40.940
we are here to help you.

01:05:41.023 --> 01:05:42.942
I don't like the
look of it Holmes.

01:05:54.787 --> 01:05:56.789
Holmes!

01:05:56.831 --> 01:06:00.168
Holmes, where are you?

01:06:00.209 --> 01:06:02.295
Here I am Watson.

01:06:13.598 --> 01:06:15.016
Journet?

01:06:15.099 --> 01:06:17.977
What do you want?

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.062
We've come to help you.

01:06:20.146 --> 01:06:21.731
How did you
know I was here?

01:06:21.814 --> 01:06:23.524
When you called
your hotel just now

01:06:23.566 --> 01:06:24.901
I answered the telephone.

01:06:24.984 --> 01:06:26.402
The chimes of
Brisson's clock here

01:06:26.486 --> 01:06:30.448
merely confirmed
what I already knew.

01:06:30.531 --> 01:06:32.200
You must return with
me to the café at once.

01:06:32.283 --> 01:06:33.993
I'm not leaving
this house.

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:35.703
The murderer is waiting
out there in the marshes

01:06:35.745 --> 01:06:37.371
to kill me the
moment I leave here.

01:06:37.455 --> 01:06:39.749
Naturally but first he
must have the opportunity.

01:06:39.832 --> 01:06:41.042
If you return to the café

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:42.376
he'll have
that opportunity.

01:06:42.418 --> 01:06:43.669
It's the only way we have

01:06:43.711 --> 01:06:44.837
to apprehend the murderer.

01:06:44.921 --> 01:06:46.380
What if I refuse?

01:06:46.464 --> 01:06:49.675
Journet what I
have to say to you

01:06:49.717 --> 01:06:51.469
is not going to be easy.

01:06:51.552 --> 01:06:53.221
Marie...

01:06:53.262 --> 01:06:54.722
What?

01:06:54.764 --> 01:06:59.936
Murdered.

01:07:00.019 --> 01:07:01.687
Now you know why
you must return.

01:07:01.729 --> 01:07:04.816
This fiend must be
brought to justice.

01:07:04.899 --> 01:07:06.526
Justice?

01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:08.694
This monster kills my
poor innocent child

01:07:08.778 --> 01:07:11.405
and you talk of
bringing him to justice?

01:07:11.489 --> 01:07:15.952
Will that compensate me
for the death of Marie?

01:07:16.035 --> 01:07:17.703
If it's the
last thing I do

01:07:17.745 --> 01:07:19.414
I'll kill him
with my own hands.

01:07:19.455 --> 01:07:21.457
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

01:07:21.541 --> 01:07:22.875
Once you've
returned to the hotel

01:07:22.917 --> 01:07:25.086
he'll make an attempt on
your life and we'll get him.

01:07:25.169 --> 01:07:26.796
How will we
know who he is?

01:07:26.879 --> 01:07:28.381
We already know

01:07:28.423 --> 01:07:30.925
it's his disguise that
we haven't penetrated.

01:07:30.967 --> 01:07:32.301
Who is he?

01:07:32.385 --> 01:07:34.554
Alistair Ramson.

01:07:34.595 --> 01:07:36.431
Recognize the name?

01:07:36.472 --> 01:07:38.224
He attempted to escape
from Talon Prison

01:07:38.266 --> 01:07:40.101
when I was a guard there.

01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:42.061
Journet, if you don't
want to remain in hiding

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.354
for the rest of your life

01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:44.772
you must return
to the hotel

01:07:44.856 --> 01:07:46.649
and help me to put an end
to this monster for all time.

01:07:46.732 --> 01:07:48.234
Come let's go.

01:07:48.276 --> 01:07:49.777
Good.

01:07:49.861 --> 01:07:51.028
Put an end to him,

01:07:51.112 --> 01:07:52.572
how you going to
do that Holmes?

01:07:52.613 --> 01:07:54.866
I'll tell you both about
it on the way to the hotel.

01:07:56.784 --> 01:07:58.119
So you're really
leaving Doctor?

01:07:58.202 --> 01:07:59.537
Yes Sergeant.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:00.621
Gentlemen Mr.
Sherlock Holmes and I

01:08:00.705 --> 01:08:02.248
are leaving
immediately for London.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.666
It's extremely regrettable

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:05.209
the murderer
has escaped us.

01:08:05.293 --> 01:08:07.545
All our cases cannot be
crowned with success.

01:08:07.628 --> 01:08:09.088
I'm extremely
sorry gentlemen.

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:10.923
Have you no idea where
this fiend has gone?

01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:12.383
Mr. Holmes
is of the opinion

01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:14.302
that he's escaped
across the border

01:08:14.385 --> 01:08:15.970
to the United States.

01:08:16.053 --> 01:08:18.805
It may be years before
we can trace him if ever.

01:08:18.848 --> 01:08:20.640
Oh Journet, just a minute.

01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:21.850
Our bill please.

01:08:21.934 --> 01:08:23.144
Bill?

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:24.520
Yes Mr. Sherlock
Holmes and I

01:08:24.604 --> 01:08:25.938
are leaving immediately.

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:27.314
Oh I'm sorry Doctor Watson

01:08:27.356 --> 01:08:28.566
I'm just on my
way to the church

01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:29.901
to offer a
prayer for Marie.

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:31.109
I'll forward
your bill to you.

01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:33.488
Yes of course, my dear
fellow I understand.

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:34.947
We'll leave our
address at the desk.

01:08:34.988 --> 01:08:36.407
Goodbye Mr. Potts, it's
been a great pleasure

01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:37.742
knowing a man of
your intelligence.

01:08:37.825 --> 01:08:39.118
Thank you Doctor Watson.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.620
It has been most
stimulating

01:08:40.661 --> 01:08:41.996
talking to one of your
vast experience.

01:08:42.037 --> 01:08:43.331
Oh well thank you.

01:08:43.413 --> 01:08:44.999
Let's hope that we shall
meet again some day

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:46.626
and continue our
little chats on crime.

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:47.960
It would be most exciting.

01:08:48.002 --> 01:08:49.337
Oh by the way, Mr. Holmes

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.796
would like to see for
a minute in his room.

01:08:50.837 --> 01:08:52.256
I'll show you where it is.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.633
It's the second room
on the right up there.

01:08:53.674 --> 01:08:55.051
Thanks.

01:08:55.134 --> 01:08:56.761
Emile it's me.

01:08:56.844 --> 01:08:58.054
Potts.

01:08:58.136 --> 01:09:00.223
Do you mind if I walk
part of the way with you?

01:09:00.305 --> 01:09:02.308
It's a bit
frightening out here.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:04.435
It's these marshes.

01:09:04.519 --> 01:09:06.354
This is almost
the very spot

01:09:06.395 --> 01:09:08.689
where Lady Penrose
was attacked,

01:09:08.773 --> 01:09:11.526
three deaths
in three days.

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:13.611
It's a pity Marie
had to be killed.

01:09:13.694 --> 01:09:16.072
She was such
a sweet child.

01:09:16.154 --> 01:09:19.075
Three deaths in three days

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:22.662
and still one more
to be accounted for.

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:24.580
You are frightened Emile.

01:09:24.663 --> 01:09:27.500
It's strange to see
you showing fear.

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:33.381
The man I hated
at Talon Prison.

01:09:33.423 --> 01:09:35.716
Ramson!

01:09:41.055 --> 01:09:42.723
Sherlock Holmes!

01:09:42.807 --> 01:09:44.350
Yes Mr. Ramson.

01:09:44.392 --> 01:09:45.893
So you see
the final curtain

01:09:45.977 --> 01:09:47.478
has not fallen after all.

01:09:47.562 --> 01:09:49.104
I thought you were on
your way to London.

01:09:49.188 --> 01:09:51.064
Naturally that's what
I wanted you to think.

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:52.774
That's why Doctor Watson

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:54.527
announced our
departure in the café.

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:56.028
Journet's leaving
was purely bait

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.613
to bring you
into the open.

01:09:57.697 --> 01:09:59.073
I merely replaced Journet

01:09:59.115 --> 01:10:00.533
once he was outside
on the street.

01:10:00.575 --> 01:10:02.201
May I say monsieur Ramson

01:10:02.243 --> 01:10:03.703
that your disguise
as a postman

01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:05.329
was a masterpiece
of ingenuity?

01:10:05.413 --> 01:10:06.914
Your very
choice of the role

01:10:06.998 --> 01:10:08.583
put you above suspicion.

01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:10.209
It was quite easy.

01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:11.878
I simply disposed of
the real Mr. Potts

01:10:11.919 --> 01:10:14.255
after he had past his
civil service examination

01:10:14.297 --> 01:10:17.383
and had been assigned
to La Morte Rouge.

01:10:17.425 --> 01:10:19.552
You realize of course
that you'll never hand me

01:10:19.594 --> 01:10:21.095
over to the police alive?

01:10:21.137 --> 01:10:22.847
It's not my function
to be your executioner.

01:10:22.930 --> 01:10:24.682
My duty is to hand you
over to the authorities,

01:10:24.766 --> 01:10:26.225
which I fully
intend to do.

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:27.894
You're an optimist
Mr. Holmes.

01:10:27.977 --> 01:10:29.312
Oh not necessarily.

01:10:29.395 --> 01:10:31.814
We're surrounded by
police awaiting my signal.

01:12:11.539 --> 01:12:15.877
I killed him with this.

01:12:15.918 --> 01:12:17.503
Ramson's
instrument of death

01:12:17.545 --> 01:12:19.881
has been his
own executioner.

01:12:19.964 --> 01:12:22.800
Well gentlemen our
search for the monster

01:12:22.884 --> 01:12:25.011
has ended where it
began, on the marshes.

01:12:25.052 --> 01:12:26.429
Hey Watson?

01:12:26.512 --> 01:12:28.222
Watson where are you?

01:12:28.264 --> 01:12:30.224
Why isn't here, he was
with us a minute ago.

01:12:30.266 --> 01:12:31.601
Watson!

01:12:31.684 --> 01:12:33.311
Here, here I am Holmes.

01:12:33.394 --> 01:12:34.896
Where are you?

01:12:34.979 --> 01:12:37.231
I've fallen in
another hole.

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.864
I shall like to see
a bit more of Canada

01:12:44.947 --> 01:12:46.783
before we sail Holmes.

01:12:46.866 --> 01:12:49.577
So should I Watson.

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:54.457
Canada, the linchpin of
the English speaking world

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.417
whose relations
of friendly intimacy

01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:59.253
with the United States
on the one hand

01:12:59.295 --> 01:13:02.340
and unswerving fidelity
to the British Commonwealth

01:13:02.423 --> 01:13:05.593
and the Motherland
on the other.

01:13:05.635 --> 01:13:10.139
Canada, the link
that joins together

01:13:10.223 --> 01:13:13.434
these great branches
of the human family.

01:13:13.518 --> 01:13:15.144
Churchill say that?

01:13:15.228 --> 01:13:18.064
Yes Watson Churchill.
