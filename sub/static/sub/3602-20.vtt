NARRA TOR:
Previously on Heroes.

00:04.213 --> 00:05.248
Peter Petrelli.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.174
My name is Hiro Nakamura.

00:07.258 --> 00:08.839
I'm from the future.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.006
I have a message for you.

00:10.094 --> 00:11.800
The cheerleader.
You have to save her.

00:11.888 --> 00:12.968
It's the only way
to prevent it.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.920
Prevent what?
Everything.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.265
He says that
we all meet up somehow.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.341
Sometime in the future,
Iguess.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.426
| see.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.933
He said something bad
is gonna happen,
but we can stop it.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.764
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

00:29.947 --> 00:32.108
...to die here with you,

00:32.200 --> 00:35.283
but not before I show them
how to kill you
and stop the bomb.

00:35.620 --> 00:40.535
Whether you're 16 or 64,
I will be there for you.
Always.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.583
Eleven years and I am
still directing traffic.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.330
I wish you could see
what I see.

00:45.421 --> 00:47.127
We're having a baby!

00:47.215 --> 00:50.548
I need you to know that
lwould never let
anything happen to you.

00:50.635 --> 00:53.502
You're gonna win
your election.
I'll see to that.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.674
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

01:08.903 --> 01:12.816
Hello? Mr. Isaac? Mr. Isaac!

01:16.327 --> 01:17.737
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

01:31.425 --> 01:32.585
(SWORD SWISHING)

01:45.731 --> 01:46.937
You.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.106
Me?

01:50.403 --> 01:52.564
What are you doing here?

01:52.655 --> 01:54.020
You're not
supposed to be here.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.821
None of this
is supposed to be here.

01:55.908 --> 01:59.241
HIRO: It was an accident.
We time-traveled.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.535
ANDO: What happened
to the city?

02:05.918 --> 02:07.124
The bomb.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.126
The bomb still happened.

02:13.217 --> 02:15.378
It was all supposed to change.

02:17.346 --> 02:20.338
Five years ago,
a man named Sylar exploded
in the heart of the city,

02:20.433 --> 02:22.890
changing the world forever.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.010
I thought I had it
all figured out.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.596
I thought I had it all beat.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.352
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

03:13.402 --> 03:15.893
Save the cheerleader...
Save the world!

03:15.988 --> 03:18.024
You visited Peter Petrelli
with this message.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.855
Yes, did he do it?
Did Peter save her?

03:19.950 --> 03:22.612
Yes, he did.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.239
Claire is still alive.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.821
Which means
Sylar never took her power.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.827
Which means you were able
to kill him, right?

03:28.918 --> 03:31.125
Me? Kill Sylar?

03:37.009 --> 03:38.510
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

04:06.122 --> 04:08.579
Because he had
the cheerleader's power.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.714
But I can't go back.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.632
I can't control my powers.

04:20.719 --> 04:24.211
If I try, Ando and I can
appear anywhere.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.144
Hiro!

04:34.191 --> 04:35.567
(FUTURE HIRO
SPEAKING JAPANESE)

04:42.491 --> 04:43.776
Well, what do you know?

04:43.868 --> 04:46.325
Hiro Nakamura.

04:46.412 --> 04:48.118
Go after his friends!

04:48.205 --> 04:50.412
The Haitian stays with me.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.709
lwant to
take him in personally.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.828
What?

04:56.672 --> 04:58.628
Hey! What's going on?

04:58.716 --> 05:01.958
Get out of those clothes.
You're sticking out
like a sore thumb.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.213
What happened to Hiro?
Who was that?

05:04.305 --> 05:06.421
Homeland Security.
The government?

05:06.515 --> 05:08.972
They're taking him
to a special holding facility
in Midtown.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.469
How can you be so sure?

05:10.561 --> 05:12.142
Because that's where
they take all the terrorists.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.561
Why would anyone think
that Hiro's a...

05:16.066 --> 05:18.728
You? A terrorist?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.819
After Sylar exploded,

05:22.907 --> 05:25.569
the world became
a very dark place.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.150
And that is why
we need to change it.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.487
Get him back
so he can kill Sylar.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.118
Then let's go get Hiro.

05:33.209 --> 05:34.995
You can freeze time.
We'll teleport in.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.916
No,no,no,
it's not that simple.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.622
The Haitian has a way
of stopping my powers.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.832
We need help.

05:42.927 --> 05:46.636
There's only one person
who's powerful enough
to get us through.

05:46.722 --> 05:50.260
Peter Petrelli.
We're going to Las Vegas.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.084
This is where we're
going to find Peter Petrelli?

06:16.168 --> 06:19.626
No. This is where we find
his girlfriend.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.306
D.J..' And now,
on the center stage,
gentlemen,

06:32.393 --> 06:36.181
please give it up
for the main event, Jessica!

06:36.313 --> 06:37.689
(ALL CHEERING)

06:45.114 --> 06:47.605
Maybe the future's not so bad.

07:09.179 --> 07:13.889
You have one song,
two minutes and $500. After
that, you're out of here.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.762
You got me, Hiro?

07:16.812 --> 07:19.804
It's me, Niki. Ando.
Do you remember?

07:19.898 --> 07:21.183
Is this how you're
gonna use your time?

07:21.275 --> 07:23.516
I need to find Peter.
It's important.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.442
War's over, General Chow.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.485
We lost, remember?

07:28.324 --> 07:29.609
Peter's not interested.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.281
You could talk to him.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.405
Tell him it's about
stopping Sylar.

07:35.623 --> 07:39.366
You say that name again
and I will break your neck.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.830
Do you know where Bennet is?

07:52.723 --> 07:56.307
Far as I know,
he's still rustling cattle
in Texas.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.141
How are the receipts tonight,
Marco?

08:06.236 --> 08:07.612
It was a good night, ma'am.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.232
Good.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.869
You don't have to be here.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.913
I told you that
I can handle it.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.833
What did he want?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.706
What do you think?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.504
He's still trying to
stop an exploding man.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.377
Hey, Sylar's dead.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.881
I sent him off to Bennet.
Just let him deal.

08:42.398 --> 08:44.434
Of all the days, huh?

08:44.525 --> 08:46.607
Today is just another day.

08:49.113 --> 08:50.523
You lost your son, Niki...

08:50.614 --> 08:52.775
It's called letting go.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.200
Maybe you should
give it a try.

08:57.287 --> 09:01.326
Or would you rather go off
with your buddy
and fight the pain away?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.420
I'm not going anywhere.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.161
This is all misunderstanding.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.912
Hiro Nakamura.

09:51.008 --> 09:54.626
Born: Osaka, Japan,
to Kaito and lshi.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.006
Teleportation. Stopping time.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.382
Prison breaks.

09:58.474 --> 09:59.930
Attacks against
US. interests.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.508
No, I don't think
there's any misunderstanding.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.638
Prison breaks?

10:03.729 --> 10:06.391
Two years ago,
you killed a lot of good men

10:06.482 --> 10:08.973
when you raided
the National Science Center
in Raleigh.

10:09.067 --> 10:14.027
No, I know myself.
I'm not a killer.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.907
How can you not remember that?

10:22.998 --> 10:25.489
Because I do not know
what you are talking about.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.916
I'm talking about
men like you and Sylar
ruining it for the rest of us.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.415
Making us live in fear,
captivity, and hiding.

10:30.506 --> 10:34.545
Making us choose sides.
Tearing families apart.

10:35.469 --> 10:39.212
lwould never
tear a family apart.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.382
H/RO: / just want to
be a hero.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.309
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing, Nakamura,

10:46.396 --> 10:50.059
what you're hiding.
But I'm gonna
get it out of you.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.566
That's right. We got him.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.733
We've been after him
for years,

10:53.821 --> 10:56.813
and today he decides to
get sloppy just before
the anniversary?

10:56.907 --> 11:00.024
/ thought that’d be
good news to announce
at the speech tomorrow.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.074
This can't be a coincidence.
They're up to something.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.447
I need to know what it is.

11:03.539 --> 11:04.494
That could be a problem.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.118
He doesn't seem to
remember anything about
the last five years.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.574
You sure it's...

11:08.752 --> 11:12.370
It's really him?
It's not a trick
or an illusion or something?

11:12.464 --> 11:14.000
Anything seems possible
these days.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.587
There may be something
we've overlooked.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.634
You’re a mind reader, Parkman.

11:19.721 --> 11:23.259
Rip it out of him.
If you can't do it,
I'll get someone who can.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.512
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.806
Send in the professor.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.157
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.235
We've captured Hiro Nakamura
in Manhattan.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.990
That's excellent news,
Mr. President.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.197
It seems we're
running into some problems.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.999
You're the only person I trust
to figure out
what's going on up there.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.542
I'll be on
the first flight to New York.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.664
Thank you.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.963
That's not why
I asked you here.
Please sit down.

11:58.635 --> 12:03.049
Five years ago,
you and I allowed a man
to blow up in New York.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.724
Millions of lives
came to an end,
and the world was changed.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.517
Soon after,
we sat down in my office.
Do you remember?

12:09.605 --> 12:13.223
Of course. We made a pact
to eliminate such danger
at any cost.

12:13.317 --> 12:16.525
Billions in research later,

12:16.653 --> 12:18.689
how close are we to that?

12:19.990 --> 12:21.855
We...

12:21.950 --> 12:25.283
We're not much closer
to reversing their condition
than when we started.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.780
And what's the problem?

12:26.872 --> 12:28.783
It's hard coded in their DNA.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.410
It's like they're
a separate species.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.991
We cannot change who they are,
Mr. President.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.210
No, no, the measures
that we've put in place...

12:36.298 --> 12:38.755
They're not working.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.299
We've outlawed their breeding.
We've confined their movement.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.344
We police them. We track them.
Their attacks continue.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.173
Their population is increasing
exponentially.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.598
Your numbers.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.391
Yesterday in Santa Cruz,

12:50.479 --> 12:53.391
a boy somehow sucked
all the oxygen out of the air.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.974
Suffocated his
entire middle school.

12:57.069 --> 12:59.060
My God.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.861
These events are increasing.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.861
People are anticipating
another Sylar.

13:06.370 --> 13:10.739
In your original assessment,
you posited
a potential solution.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.447
Exﬂncﬂon.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.043
Yes, but I never meant to
suggest that...

13:14.127 --> 13:16.413
"They wouldn't be
the first species
to be exterminated

13:16.505 --> 13:18.917
"for the preservation
of another."

13:19.007 --> 13:20.042
Your words.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.670
l was talking about
the natural order of things.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.592
What you're talking about
is genocide.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.389
Self-defense.
And I'm not suggesting
it lightly.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.467
We've just run out of options.

13:31.561 --> 13:35.179
You haven't slept
in five years, Mohinder.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.185
We need to put an end to this.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.562
You're one of them, Nathan.

13:40.654 --> 13:44.317
Am I supposed to march you off
to the gas chambers as well?

13:44.408 --> 13:47.024
I'm thankful for
the secrets you've kept.

13:47.119 --> 13:52.239
But let's be honest.
I can fly.
I'm hardly dangerous.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.209
I value your opinion
as a scientist and a friend.

13:57.295 --> 14:03.131
But if I gave you five years,
ten years, 20 more years,
be honest with me.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.673
Could you reverse it?

14:08.765 --> 14:11.427
No. Probably not.

14:13.437 --> 14:17.021
Then we need to
start thinking about Plan B.

14:21.403 --> 14:25.988
I don't care about
five years ago. What are you
planning for tonight?

14:29.619 --> 14:33.203
You are like me. Special.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.703
Why do you want to hurt
other special people?

14:36.793 --> 14:38.704
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

14:41.048 --> 14:42.629
Yeah, it's Parkman.

14:43.592 --> 14:47.210
Suresh? What's he doing there?

14:47.304 --> 14:48.669
Watch him.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.194
MR. BENNET: You ready?

15:14.331 --> 15:18.119
Pad turns red,
you're one of them
and they'll arrest you.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.997
Pad turns blue,
you're free to go.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.796
From now on you will be
the Cranes from Boise, Idaho.

15:28.887 --> 15:34.098
We've enclosed back stories,
references, and money, okay?

15:34.184 --> 15:36.391
How do we know
when we're safe?

15:36.478 --> 15:39.515
You don't. Not ever.

15:44.528 --> 15:48.020
Always keep a refrigerated
sample of this on your person.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.946
Buy a thermos.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.400
Now, you're gonna
have to be vigilant.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.486
Always on the lookout.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.206
Can you do that, son?

16:02.003 --> 16:03.254
Yes, sir.

16:04.339 --> 16:07.957
Good man. Okay, we have to go.

16:14.224 --> 16:17.182
Do whatever it takes
to protect him.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.151
It's out of the question.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.236
It's Homeland Security.
I need help getting in there.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.661
These people trust me.

16:38.748 --> 16:39.999
They come to me
to keep them hidden.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.165
You're asking me to do
the exact opposite!

16:42.252 --> 16:44.368
I'm only asking for the ones
that I brought to you.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.498
D.L., Candice, Molly Walker.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.376
And they'll all be safe
when we succeed.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.297
Sorry, I can't help you.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.001
He saved your daughter's life.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.085
Excuse me?

16:54.181 --> 16:55.671
Your daughter.
The cheerleader.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.427
She's alive because of Hiro.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.135
What is he talking about?

17:02.230 --> 17:07.065
Five years ago, I asked Peter
to save Claire from Sylar
at Homecoming.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.894
My friend tells me he did it.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.774
Claire's alive.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.355
Isn't she?

17:22.292 --> 17:26.706
You guys sit tight.
I'll see what I can do.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.418
Each string represents
a person.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.250
Every action, every choice.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.927
About how people
came together,
how they were torn apart.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.175
It's a living map of the past.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.850
Why would a terrorist
care so much about the past?

17:45.815 --> 17:48.431
Maybe he thought
he could change it.

17:49.819 --> 17:53.186
Hiro Nakamura can stop time,
teleport by folding space.

17:53.281 --> 17:57.069
Theoretically,
he can fold time as well.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.152
MATT: So you're saying
he's a time traveler.

18:00.247 --> 18:04.411
Is that any stranger
than being able to
read someone's mind?

18:04.501 --> 18:06.287
Yeah, it is.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.084
Haven't you ever wished
you could change the past?

18:09.172 --> 18:10.787
Set your life down
a different path?

18:10.882 --> 18:12.713
I used to be that guy.

18:12.801 --> 18:16.589
Wishing it
and making it happen
are two different things.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.672
Not for Nakamura, it isn't.
Look here.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.557
These two dates seem to be
the focal points.
Both in the past.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.432
The first is the bomb.
The other...

18:28.233 --> 18:29.313
What? What is it?

18:31.861 --> 18:35.570
The other's the day
I received my father's ashes.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.778
I was with Peter Petrelli
that day.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.484
On the subway, he said he saw
a man who could freeze time.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.785
Nakamura?
I don't know.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.864
He said he had
a message for Peter.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.076
What? What was the message?

18:52.966 --> 18:56.299
Hey! What was the message?

18:57.387 --> 18:59.423
"Save the cheerleader.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.009
"Save the world."

19:11.651 --> 19:15.439
All right,
here are your chilaquiles
and your waffle platter.

19:15.530 --> 19:18.397
Nowjust holler at me
if y'all need anything else.
Okay?

19:19.784 --> 19:22.116
REPORTER ON TV: Right now
we ’re watching live footage
of the President

19:22.203 --> 19:26.071
approaching Marine One
for his trip to his
home state, New York.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.865
The White House promises
a major policy shift...

19:28.960 --> 19:29.995
You know, Sandra,

19:30.086 --> 19:31.496
for a girl who's supposed
to hate the President,

19:31.588 --> 19:33.954
you sure do perk up
whenever he's on.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.127
A guy could get jealous.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.928
He's old enough
to be my father.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.225
Hey, so what did you think
of Rafferty's?

19:47.312 --> 19:49.052
For the reception.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.012
You were supposed
to check it out, remember?

19:51.107 --> 19:54.224
I'm sorry. I forgot.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.324
You're not getting cold feet,
are you?

20:00.408 --> 20:02.364
No, of course not.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.865
My feet are very warm.
Two-pairs-of-socks warm.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.161
VVeH,good.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.705
Because I'm kind of
crazy about you.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.829
You know that.

20:14.964 --> 20:19.628
The creepy guy
with glasses is back.
Sitting in your section again.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.399
There we go.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.439
Thanks.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.893
Would you like a scoop
of ice cream on that?

20:37.987 --> 20:42.981
No, not today, thank you.
But my table's
a little sticky.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.578
Someone knows about you,
Claire.

20:49.666 --> 20:53.534
You need to leave
as soon as possible.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.870
There's a bag
on the chair to my right.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.591
Leave?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.259
What am I supposed to
tell Andy?

21:03.346 --> 21:05.962
Tell him nothing. Just go.

21:07.517 --> 21:10.429
I can't do that to him.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.556
We're getting married.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.277
Have you told him?

21:18.361 --> 21:19.521
No.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.981
All I want is
a normal life, Dad.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.942
I've done my best
to provide that for you.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.617
But people are starting
to ask questions.

21:28.705 --> 21:33.495
Now, I am trying to control
the information, but it's not
safe here anymore.

21:33.585 --> 21:36.497
I've been hiding
for five years.
California, Nevada.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.749
I brought you back to Midland.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.627
Only after Mom left.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.756
REPORTER ON TV:
This word just coming in.
We have breaking news...

21:45.847 --> 21:47.633
Ijust want you to be safe.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.306
...enforcement agents
have just bravely rounded up

21:50.393 --> 21:52.679
over 200 undocumented
individuals

21:52.770 --> 21:55.933
as part of a coordinated
nationwide sweep.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.982
This has been cited as
the department’s
most successful operation

21:59.068 --> 22:02.481
since the Linderman Act
was passed four years ago.

22:02.572 --> 22:03.732
Homeland Security spokesmen

22:03.823 --> 22:07.065
praised the near-perfect
execution from local police,

22:07.160 --> 22:09.742
citing zero casualties
on the enforcement side...

22:09.829 --> 22:11.694
Enjoy your pie.

22:11.789 --> 22:15.782
Officials were also sure
to note that community tips...

22:19.547 --> 22:22.163
The incident resulted
in the safe transport
of suspects

22:22.258 --> 22:25.466
to special regional
holding facilities
within their states,

22:25.553 --> 22:28.511
where the individuals
will meet with federal/y
provided attorneys

22:28.598 --> 22:30.714
to discuss
their legal options.

22:30.808 --> 22:32.673
And a note to our viewers.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.305
If you see any
suspicious activity, please...

22:34.395 --> 22:37.353
D.L. can phase inside
the buildings.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.931
Candice's illusion
could distract the guards.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.527
Hey, what about me?

22:41.611 --> 22:42.726
You'll help too.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.197
That's not what I meant.

22:47.951 --> 22:50.237
Am I rich? Married?

22:50.328 --> 22:51.864
I can't tell you that.

22:51.955 --> 22:52.990
Why not?

22:53.665 --> 22:55.075
Because”.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.908
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

23:04.592 --> 23:08.585
So, my friend
is still in there.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.514
There's something
I need to tell you.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.229
(SCREAMING)

23:29.492 --> 23:31.403
We already caught you.

23:32.996 --> 23:37.410
Two Hiros. Son of a bitch!
He really can
travel through time.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.067
What?

24:22.670 --> 24:24.752
Your friends got away.

24:24.839 --> 24:27.125
If they were my friends,
I wouldn't have called you,
Matt.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.797
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.295
That's the deal, right?

24:30.386 --> 24:34.755
I turn you on to the dangerous
refugees, and you let me
help the harmless ones.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.885
Doesn't hurt that we're both
harboring children
of interest.

24:36.976 --> 24:40.013
Of course, mine isn't
the President's daughter.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.765
She's getting married.

24:41.856 --> 24:45.098
Mazel tov. I guess.

24:47.236 --> 24:51.229
Have you heard anything
from Janice?

25:04.212 --> 25:07.124
You ever wish you
did something different?

25:07.382 --> 25:09.373
Wish you
took a different path?

25:09.467 --> 25:11.082
Every day.

25:16.599 --> 25:21.093
You did right by her, Matt.
You did right by him.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.723
Thanks.

25:22.814 --> 25:25.851
I really appreciate
all you've done for them.

25:32.281 --> 25:34.021
(GRUNTING)

25:35.451 --> 25:37.737
What are you doing?

25:37.829 --> 25:40.366
I'm ending our arrangement.

25:41.332 --> 25:44.290
Unfortunately,
I have to explain
to the President

25:44.377 --> 25:46.959
that there's a second
Hiro Nakamura out there.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.788
Now I gotta tell him
how I let him get away.

25:49.882 --> 25:54.216
See, I can't come back
empty-handed.
Now, tell me where she is.

26:02.562 --> 26:03.972
No.

26:06.649 --> 26:07.638
(GUN FIRES)

26:20.204 --> 26:22.411
Let's elope.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.658
What?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.035
Let's elope.

26:25.126 --> 26:27.412
Right now, run away.
I'm thinking Vegas.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.585
We'll pack our bags.
Get hitched tonight.

26:29.672 --> 26:33.256
Take off, see the world.
What do you think?

26:33.342 --> 26:35.754
I think you're crazy.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.180
Maybe.

26:39.682 --> 26:41.013
Probably.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.597
But I've got my reasons.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.600
And I promise
I'll tell you everything.

26:51.194 --> 26:54.186
Will you do it? For me?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.196
I'll do anything for you.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.152
Let me get my things.
Okay.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.118
Coffee?

27:10.671 --> 27:11.956
Coffee?

27:20.264 --> 27:21.879
Can I get something
for you, sir?

27:23.976 --> 27:26.558
I don't know, Claire.
What's good?

27:28.940 --> 27:32.558
"Save the cheerleader.
Save the world."
What does that mean?

27:32.652 --> 27:33.812
How do you know that?

27:33.903 --> 27:36.144
Five years ago,
Peter Petrelli and I
were on the subway.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.275
He said someone stopped time.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.152
That's what you do,
Mr. Nakamura.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.825
Peter and I were on our way
to see Isaac Mendez that day,

27:42.912 --> 27:45.153
an artist who can
paint the future.

27:45.248 --> 27:48.240
A lot of his work
is remarkably accurate.

27:50.253 --> 27:51.663
Except this.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.164
Is that a new 9th Wonder?

27:53.256 --> 27:54.416
MOHINDER: The events
in this comic.

27:54.507 --> 27:58.546
History didn't
happen like this.
You didn't kill Sylar.

27:58.636 --> 28:03.096
You're trying to
change the past. Trying to
stop Sylar, is that it?

28:04.183 --> 28:08.347
If you could save
millions of lives,
wouldn't you?

28:16.112 --> 28:17.397
Thank you.

28:20.324 --> 28:21.939
Is that really you, Ando?

28:22.034 --> 28:24.867
Why are you so
surprised to see me?

28:24.954 --> 28:26.535
He didn't tell you?

28:28.833 --> 28:30.369
What?

28:30.459 --> 28:32.541
You're dead.

28:33.963 --> 28:34.952
How?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.628
In New York.

28:36.716 --> 28:37.922
The bomb.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.545
Really?

28:43.347 --> 28:46.805
Do you remember
how he used to be?
All full of hope and optimism?

28:46.893 --> 28:49.635
Of course.
That's the Hiro I know.

28:51.022 --> 28:53.479
He went away the day you died.

28:56.110 --> 28:57.896
You know, between you and me,

28:58.821 --> 29:00.812
I think you're the reason
why he became so obsessed

29:00.907 --> 29:03.364
with trying to
change it all back.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.825
He wants to save you.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.618
NIKI: Hey, baby,
are you in here?

29:20.968 --> 29:25.758
Nakamura was trying to
find a way to kill Sylar
before he exploded.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.429
You actually think
he can make that happen?

29:29.143 --> 29:32.385
Without Sylar, the world
would have never considered
these people to be dangerous.

29:32.480 --> 29:36.439
None of this would've
everhappened.
Imagine the possibilities.

29:36.525 --> 29:40.017
If he kills Sylar,
we can change the past.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.316
I don't have that luxury.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.238
I need to find answers
in the here and now.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.862
Genocide is not an answer.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.614
Is that what this is about?

29:48.704 --> 29:50.535
You're feeling bad
because you came up short?

29:50.623 --> 29:52.204
It's wrong.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.249
I was elected
to make hard decisions.

29:55.336 --> 29:58.794
I understand how things work.
And how is this going to work?

29:58.881 --> 30:01.088
Today I'm going to announce
that you've developed

30:01.175 --> 30:03.962
a treatment to reverse this.

30:04.053 --> 30:06.214
You're going to lie.

30:07.014 --> 30:08.390
The world will cheer.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.965
And what happens
when people start dying?

30:11.060 --> 30:13.426
I'll say you made a mistake.

30:14.063 --> 30:15.348
A fatal error.

30:15.439 --> 30:18.772
At first,
the world will mourn.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.646
They'll be united in grief.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.444
And then they'll
just be united.

30:26.075 --> 30:29.408
Mohinder, I need to know
if I can trust you.

30:30.413 --> 30:32.904
I need to know
if you're with me.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.827
Are you with me on this?

30:38.004 --> 30:39.585
Of course.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.924
Mr. President.
There are two of them, sir.
Two...

30:46.262 --> 30:47.468
Hiros.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.216
You're sure?
I am.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.842
I think we got
the younger one.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.515
It explains the gaps
in his knowledge.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.591
I want to put him down.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.268
No.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.432
I want Dr. Suresh to do it.

31:07.241 --> 31:08.606
Yes, sir.

31:09.452 --> 31:10.817
Mr. President,

31:12.163 --> 31:15.371
that's not the only thing
that I found in Texas.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.374
NATHAN: I thought
you were dead.

31:28.804 --> 31:32.046
You have no idea how important
you are to me, Claire.

31:32.141 --> 31:34.473
I'm not important.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.892
I'm just a waitress.

31:36.979 --> 31:39.812
We both know that isn't true.

31:39.899 --> 31:42.606
You made everyone
afraid of us.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.275
I made everyone aware of us.

31:46.614 --> 31:50.948
Fear is just
the natural response.
You can't blame them, really.

31:51.035 --> 31:55.995
We're more powerful
than they are. More important.
We're special.

31:56.082 --> 31:59.324
Who are you to decide
who's special and who's not?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.702
I'm the leader
of the free world.

32:02.797 --> 32:06.915
For all I know, I'm the most
special person there is.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.250
Lord knows
I found enough power,

32:09.345 --> 32:12.428
met a lot of special people.

32:12.515 --> 32:16.975
Like this girl named Candice
who allowed me
to become President.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.347
But I'm done.

32:20.189 --> 32:23.681
I just want to eliminate
the competition.

32:23.776 --> 32:28.361
I don't need any more power.
Especially not after you.

32:36.664 --> 32:37.995
Sylar.

32:43.629 --> 32:47.213
I've waited a long time
for this.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.265
You've always wanted
to become a kendo master.

33:06.902 --> 33:10.941
I studied in Tohoku,
so technically
I'm a Battojutsu master.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.904
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

33:43.564 --> 33:46.101
Remember what we
promised each other?

33:46.192 --> 33:48.308
Yeah, I remember.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.267
Then why can't you
just let it go?

33:50.362 --> 33:52.899
Hey, I'm not the one
who can't let go.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.400
You gonna call yourself
Jessica on stage

33:54.491 --> 33:56.698
night after night and act like
nothing gets to you?

33:56.785 --> 33:59.618
We both know that's not true.
That is not who you are.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.445
It is now.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.452
You're gonna
look in that mirror,

34:04.543 --> 34:08.456
but nobody is looking back
butyou.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.538
She is gone, Niki.

34:10.633 --> 34:14.091
D.L. is gone. Micah is gone.

34:14.178 --> 34:16.510
You have to accept your loss.

34:16.597 --> 34:19.213
Jessica was right all along.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.640
Look out for yourself.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.092
Don't get attached.

34:23.187 --> 34:25.348
I don't buy it.

34:25.439 --> 34:28.897
Then why are you
in such a hurry to leave me?

34:28.984 --> 34:30.019
My own reasons.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.977
And I'm not leaving anything.
I'll be back.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.063
What reasons?

34:37.368 --> 34:41.281
What makes you think
that you are so important

34:41.372 --> 34:43.363
that you have to
fix everything?

34:43.457 --> 34:45.573
Because I do.
Why?

34:45.668 --> 34:47.954
Why does it fall on
your shoulders
to save everyone?

34:48.045 --> 34:49.910
Because it was me!

34:50.005 --> 34:52.087
The bomb? It was me!

34:52.174 --> 34:54.460
I killed all those people.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.758
I killed Micah.

34:56.845 --> 34:59.097
No, it was Sylar.

34:59.181 --> 35:00.887
Everyone knows!
It wasn't.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.090
Nathan lied.

35:02.184 --> 35:05.597
He lied to protect me.
He told everybody
that it was Sylar.

35:05.688 --> 35:08.270
Think about it. You know me.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.063
You know what I can do.

35:10.150 --> 35:13.062
Listen, if there is a chance

35:13.153 --> 35:16.611
that Hiro can undo this,
I have to help him.

35:19.076 --> 35:22.364
You walk out that door,
you don't come back.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.744
Is everything okay?

35:28.836 --> 35:31.202
No. Let's go fix it.

35:34.591 --> 35:38.254
My fellow Americans,
fellow New Yorkers,

35:38.345 --> 35:40.802
please let us take a moment
to remember the men,

35:40.889 --> 35:44.017
women and children
who were taken from us

35:44.101 --> 35:46.387
five years ago.

35:46.478 --> 35:51.222
Five bells for
the five years of sorrow.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.565
(BELL RINGING)

36:09.335 --> 36:10.415
Sacrifice.

36:12.171 --> 36:15.038
It's something that we're all
too familiar with.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.168
We've all lost.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.045
We’ve all mourned.

36:19.136 --> 36:23.004
And we’ve all had to become
soldiers, heroes,

36:24.099 --> 36:27.591
protecting one another
from the gravest of dangers.

36:28.187 --> 36:31.145
This is a battle
that none of us wanted,

36:31.231 --> 36:33.688
one that we entered
with a heavy heart...

36:33.776 --> 36:34.856
Should we freeze time?

36:34.943 --> 36:37.525
No, I haven't had
a good fight in years.

36:37.613 --> 36:40.855
...knowing that the enemy
was ourselves.

36:40.949 --> 36:44.077
We’ve won battles
the world over,

36:44.161 --> 36:47.028
not only against those
that would do us harm,

36:47.122 --> 36:50.660
but against poverty,
rec/aiming the environment...

36:50.751 --> 36:52.616
Upstairs our powers
will be blocked
by the Haitian.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.202
We need to take him out
so the other Hiro can
teleport out of here.

36:55.297 --> 36:56.662
But there are guards up there.

36:56.757 --> 36:59.248
Won't they be
waiting for us with guns?

36:59.343 --> 37:01.299
But we do not forget the price

37:01.678 --> 37:02.838
that we've had to pay.

37:02.930 --> 37:06.297
The laws that
we’ve had to pass
to keep our citizens safe...

37:06.392 --> 37:08.508
Put them all down. No warning.

37:08.602 --> 37:11.059
...to preserve
our way of life.

37:11.146 --> 37:14.980
Our hope has always been
that a great peace
is on the horizon.

37:15.067 --> 37:19.936
That one day wounds
would be healed
and salvation could be found.

37:20.030 --> 37:24.273
I’m here to tell you
that that day is today.

37:24.368 --> 37:27.075
I’m proud to announce
that we have developed
a treatment,

37:27.162 --> 37:30.620
a method to reverse
the genetic code.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.747
The first clinics will open
next month across the world.

37:35.838 --> 37:39.922
And soon, we can begin
lifting restrictions.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.751
Cities and families
can be reunited.

37:43.846 --> 37:47.589
And we can finally
live without fear.

37:47.683 --> 37:52.973
We ’ve been vigilant.
We have been uncompromising.

37:53.063 --> 37:57.523
And our efforts have paid off.

37:59.403 --> 38:01.359
The nightmare is over.

38:02.781 --> 38:06.239
The world is saved.

38:10.164 --> 38:11.449
Why are we waiting, sir?

38:11.540 --> 38:12.950
Why can't we just
bring the fight to them?

38:13.041 --> 38:14.121
Because we'd lose.

38:14.209 --> 38:17.201
The Haitian's up here,
so up here, they're powerless.

38:18.172 --> 38:20.538
Weapons free. Shoot on sight.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.345
I must go back
to stop explosion.

38:29.433 --> 38:31.424
You know I'm telling truth.
Hold him down.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.349
Please don't do this!

38:37.065 --> 38:38.771
I'm sorry.

38:48.076 --> 38:50.533
Come on. Come on, come on!

38:51.997 --> 38:53.578
You're letting me go. Why?

38:53.665 --> 38:55.246
I think I'm supposed to.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.414
I'll take you where it's safe
so you can change all this.

39:08.055 --> 39:11.343
No, future me! He's good guy!

39:19.149 --> 39:20.685
Mohinder.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.016
Peter?

39:23.028 --> 39:24.188
Hiro!

39:24.279 --> 39:25.439
Ando!

39:26.698 --> 39:28.199
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

39:28.784 --> 39:30.274
You need to go back now.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.735
But how do I return
to the right moment?

39:32.829 --> 39:34.205
I don't know how to do that.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.404
I'll take you.

39:57.980 --> 40:00.221
We got blocked.
Come on, come on, move it!

40:00.315 --> 40:01.521
Move it!

40:01.608 --> 40:03.314
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:04.319 --> 40:05.308
Sir.

40:07.281 --> 40:10.739
The Haitian's down!
The Haitian is down!

40:10.826 --> 40:12.032
What about Nakamura?

40:12.119 --> 40:15.077
We can't get to him, sir.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.245
Your brother
is holding us off.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.618
lfl don’t get reinforcements
now, it’s all over, sir.

40:19.710 --> 40:21.496
Nakamura will escape.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.418
Mr. President?

40:23.505 --> 40:25.120
Mr....

40:37.311 --> 40:39.518
MATT: Come on! Bust the door!

40:39.688 --> 40:41.053
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

40:44.109 --> 40:45.144
Hiro!

40:50.032 --> 40:53.069
Get in there, Parkman.
End this.

40:53.827 --> 40:54.907
Sir.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.202
Move it!

40:59.708 --> 41:02.871
Brother versus brother.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.337
It's almost biblical.

41:04.421 --> 41:05.706
My brother
can't walk through walls.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.048
Who are you?

41:07.466 --> 41:08.706
An old friend.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.626
The guy they blame
for blowing up New York,

41:12.721 --> 41:14.837
but you and I
know the real story,
don't we, Pete?

41:14.931 --> 41:16.717
Come on, let's go!

41:19.061 --> 41:21.677
You must leave. Now!

41:22.022 --> 41:23.978
You're gonna pay
for what you did to Nathan.

41:24.066 --> 41:25.727
What you did in his name.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.557
What I did?

41:28.528 --> 41:31.361
When I killed Nathan,
he had already
turned against his own kind.

41:31.448 --> 41:32.733
Liar.
