WEBVTT

00:00.297 --> 00:02.710
Previously on "Girlfriends'
Guide to Divorce"...

00:02.758 --> 00:06.280
I was making eggs in
a hole, and I, uh...

00:06.305 --> 00:08.105
Dad.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.499
I'd like to make a toast
for being by my side.

00:10.535 --> 00:13.536
I think we make a really damn good team.

00:13.571 --> 00:15.771
- I'm a single parent myself.
- Oh.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.435
My wife died a while ago.

00:18.460 --> 00:19.575
I'm so sorry.

00:19.610 --> 00:22.678
You disappeared for months
without so much as a phone call.

00:22.714 --> 00:24.246
Why don't you just give me a chance?

00:24.282 --> 00:26.315
The deal's off. It's a buyer's market.

00:26.351 --> 00:29.485
No, I understand that
they'd be pissed. Shit.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.098
We're both in this new place...

00:31.122 --> 00:32.755
- Yeah.
- And it feels good.

00:32.790 --> 00:34.857
I noticed your neighbor closed up shop.

00:34.892 --> 00:36.492
- The record store.
- Yeah.

00:36.527 --> 00:38.027
- Last week, yeah.
- This all-female

00:38.062 --> 00:39.461
advertising thing better work,

00:39.497 --> 00:40.929
because you just tied us to it.

00:40.965 --> 00:43.732
But you trusted me
to oversee everything.

00:43.768 --> 00:44.967
This was not my vision.

00:45.002 --> 00:46.769
This isn't about you anymore.

00:46.804 --> 00:49.138
You can get on board, or you can...

00:49.173 --> 00:50.506
Or I can what?

00:50.541 --> 00:52.574
Or you can get out of the way.

00:53.383 --> 00:56.111
- _
- I did try to warn her that writing

00:56.147 --> 00:58.747
an in-depth piece on
men's rights groups

00:58.783 --> 01:00.749
was gonna kick up an epic shitstorm,

01:00.785 --> 01:04.620
and I believe I did use that
exact phrase: epic shitstorm.

01:04.655 --> 01:06.622
So, you know, I was
ignored. Par for the course.

01:06.657 --> 01:09.962
Mm. I hear you, Abby. Please feel heard.

01:11.068 --> 01:12.568
Hmm.

01:13.197 --> 01:15.097
How does all that make you feel?

01:15.454 --> 01:18.167
- It frustrates me...
- Mm.

01:18.202 --> 01:20.508
When Abby suggests that I ignore her,

01:20.533 --> 01:23.138
as I often feel she
steamrolls over me...

01:23.174 --> 01:24.740
- I do... that is...
- Whenever we have

01:24.775 --> 01:26.008
an important decision to make.

01:26.043 --> 01:27.910
Maybe when we first started.

01:27.945 --> 01:30.079
Seriously, I challenge you
to name one time in the...

01:30.114 --> 01:33.110
Exhibit A: Steamrolling. Live show.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.918
Abby, Barbara's trying
to express her feelings.

01:35.953 --> 01:38.157
Please, let her finish.

01:38.805 --> 01:41.924
Look. Did the men's
rights piece backfire?

01:41.959 --> 01:44.059
A little. But it was noisy.

01:44.095 --> 01:46.977
"Noisy." Well, that's
her new favorite word.

01:47.289 --> 01:48.610
Sorry. Abby less noisy.

01:48.635 --> 01:50.577
Can we talk about what's
really bothering you?

01:50.601 --> 01:52.101
What is really bothering me?

01:52.136 --> 01:54.236
- The profile on me in "Lenny."
- Come on.

01:54.271 --> 01:55.938
We're finally getting some heat...

01:55.973 --> 01:57.639
"Heat." Oh, my God.

01:57.675 --> 01:59.086
I think we should capitalize on it.

01:59.110 --> 02:00.187
We've had two new
advertisers since the...

02:00.211 --> 02:01.061
You see that?

02:01.086 --> 02:03.624
Kathy Lee and Hoda
video went viral... two.

02:03.649 --> 02:05.726
She can't even give me credit
for the progress we've made.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.594
And she acts like, "Oh,
everything's so good now."

02:07.618 --> 02:09.550
This whole PR thing is
not even about the budget.

02:09.586 --> 02:12.444
- ... and punish me as if...
- It's ego, and you know it.

02:12.469 --> 02:13.889
Halt!

02:15.680 --> 02:18.045
Bookmark that, okay?

02:19.177 --> 02:20.857
Where are you going?

02:20.882 --> 02:23.817
Your hour's up, and I have
a phoner in five minutes,

02:23.901 --> 02:25.667
so... it's a shut-in.

02:25.703 --> 02:29.138
Until next time, you two...

02:36.258 --> 02:37.624
Wow. Good sesh.

02:37.852 --> 02:39.852
- Mm-hmm.
- Catharsis.

02:40.084 --> 02:42.851
Yeah. Getting our money's worth.

02:43.155 --> 02:45.287
Uh, you headed back to the office?

02:45.322 --> 02:47.956
Uh, home, where your boyfriend is.

02:47.992 --> 02:49.558
He's overseeing my kitchen renovation,

02:49.593 --> 02:51.260
and I have to check in on my dad,

02:51.295 --> 02:53.540
because he's having a hard
time adjusting to the new nurse.

02:53.564 --> 02:56.582
They haven't built trust yet, so, yeah.

02:56.607 --> 02:59.601
Got it. Well, say hi to my BF.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.236
I will. I think I love him.

03:01.551 --> 03:03.872
He and I are carpooling
to Phoebe's tonight.

03:03.908 --> 03:07.009
- He mentioned. Can't miss that.
- Yeah.

03:07.044 --> 03:09.379
I don't want to not
meet the famous Keiko.

03:13.751 --> 03:15.551
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --
-- www.addic7ed.com --

03:15.586 --> 03:17.553
Wow. Leave it to you to
throw a good-bye party

03:17.588 --> 03:19.032
for a Japanese tourist you've
only known for two weeks.

03:19.056 --> 03:20.267
Well, it's been a magical two weeks.

03:20.291 --> 03:21.790
I feel very connected to Keiko.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.058
It's like I've known her my whole life.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.590
She doesn't speak a word of English.

03:24.615 --> 03:26.572
We don't have to
communicate through words.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.030
It's much deeper than that.

03:28.065 --> 03:31.034
And having her around is... It's very
beneficial for the kids, culturally.

03:31.068 --> 03:33.101
Wow, who knew?

03:33.137 --> 03:35.537
Renting out a guesthouse...
Home school for hippies.

03:35.573 --> 03:36.917
- Here you go.
- Thank you. I've got this.

03:36.941 --> 03:38.351
No. No, no, no, no. I'm gonna get it.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.142
I'm not bankrupt. Let me get it, please.

03:40.177 --> 03:42.644
Thank you. In exchange, we are gonna go

03:42.680 --> 03:44.255
to the tarot card reader on the way out.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.014
Oh, my gosh, that weird lady

03:46.050 --> 03:47.649
sitting behind that box in the alleyway?

03:47.685 --> 03:49.585
No. She smelled like
hash browns and drywall.

03:49.610 --> 03:52.788
Yeah, well, we're doing it.
I really need this right now.

03:52.823 --> 03:54.267
I need some guidance with
everything that happened

03:54.291 --> 03:55.538
with the house sale.

03:55.563 --> 03:58.694
Oh, I cannot believe I messed it up.

03:58.729 --> 04:00.162
I'm such a disaster.

04:00.197 --> 04:02.164
You're a beautiful disaster at worst.

04:02.199 --> 04:03.699
Well, that's very sweet,

04:03.734 --> 04:05.300
and way to quote a Kelly Clarkson song.

04:05.336 --> 04:06.802
- Did I?
- You did.

04:06.837 --> 04:08.483
Good for me. She's got pipes.

04:09.940 --> 04:11.340
So what's the realtor saying?

04:11.375 --> 04:13.575
Mm. That she needs to take a breather,

04:13.611 --> 04:15.344
and that she wants to lower the price,

04:15.379 --> 04:18.046
and I've been sending my resume
out to everyone, and zero bites,

04:18.082 --> 04:19.615
and I am sure that Damien Fields

04:19.649 --> 04:21.283
is just trashing my name around town.

04:21.317 --> 04:23.359
Enough with the negativity.
You're doing great.

04:23.594 --> 04:24.765
Am I?

04:24.790 --> 04:26.766
Yes. I'm proud of
you. Your shit's tight.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.190
Believe in yourself.

04:28.225 --> 04:31.326
Believe in myself? Wow. Who are you, Jo?

04:31.362 --> 04:33.762
I'm so sorry. I know. It's gross.

04:33.797 --> 04:35.931
It's just, like, my
life is kind of stable

04:35.966 --> 04:38.000
right now with the
bakery and the bald guy

04:38.035 --> 04:39.601
and my kid's warming up to him,

04:39.867 --> 04:41.336
and it's freaking me the F out.

04:41.372 --> 04:42.971
The universe is just on your side.

04:43.007 --> 04:44.305
- Mm.
- You just got to trust it.

04:45.276 --> 04:48.377
Mm. Speaking of universe,

04:48.412 --> 04:50.012
I think we should go
get our tarot cards.

04:50.047 --> 04:51.780
Oh, Jesus. Please don't do this to me.

04:51.815 --> 04:53.715
Come on. Let's go.

04:54.147 --> 04:57.386
So we feel 30% is only fair.

04:57.421 --> 04:59.187
My client was present for the conception

04:59.223 --> 05:00.367
of the idea, while he developed it.

05:00.391 --> 05:02.069
We think it is much more.

05:07.965 --> 05:10.444
Miss Banai, everything okay?

05:11.038 --> 05:13.335
Hmm? Yeah.

05:17.241 --> 05:18.671
Excuse me.

05:20.981 --> 05:22.897
I think I'm just going to...

05:25.950 --> 05:26.982
Lay down.

05:27.017 --> 05:28.632
Ooh. Ooh.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:39.694 --> 05:42.664
My money goes on husband
number one, rock star guy.

05:42.700 --> 05:43.897
What's the band's name again?

05:43.922 --> 05:45.655
I'm embarrassed to admit,
but it sounds a little bit

05:45.680 --> 05:47.233
like "Pickle Back." Stop deflecting.

05:47.258 --> 05:50.015
What she said is... Who?
Who said what to you?

05:50.040 --> 05:53.342
A very thoughtful tarot
card reader informed Phoebe

05:53.377 --> 05:56.111
that a man from her past is
coming back into her life.

05:56.146 --> 05:57.944
What if it's J.D.? He was sweet.

05:57.969 --> 06:00.522
Oh, no. She's much better off.

06:00.547 --> 06:02.329
You know, Ralph at least
had a set of testes on him.

06:02.353 --> 06:04.119
- Please don't say "testes."
- You know what?

06:04.154 --> 06:05.452
I'm not playing this game.

06:05.477 --> 06:07.033
Your prediction. Tell your daughter.

06:07.057 --> 06:09.124
Please. That woman was a lunatic.

06:09.159 --> 06:12.127
An opportunity is gonna come
into her life, and when it does,

06:12.162 --> 06:14.807
your mom has to grab
on to it or... something.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.299
That sounds cool. What if
it's about the empty store?

06:17.334 --> 06:19.079
Since when are you into tarot?
I thought I raised a realist?

06:19.103 --> 06:20.836
What store? What empty store?

06:20.871 --> 06:22.349
The record store that's
right next door to us.

06:22.373 --> 06:24.039
It closed down about a month ago.

06:24.074 --> 06:26.341
Apparently, the Venice hipsters

06:26.377 --> 06:30.012
- woke up and realized it's not 1972.
- You should talk to Glenn about it.

06:30.047 --> 06:32.848
- Who's Glenn? What's happening?
- Glenn is our landlord.

06:32.883 --> 06:34.816
He owns half of the
buildings on this block,

06:34.852 --> 06:36.396
and we don't talk to Glenn
unless we absolutely have to,

06:36.420 --> 06:39.755
because Glenn is a sexist sleaze machine

06:39.790 --> 06:42.457
who wears moccasins to the gym
and probably voted for Trump.

06:42.493 --> 06:44.371
It doesn't matter. You
need to lease the building.

06:44.395 --> 06:47.863
It's fate. You could open
an old vintage T-shirt store.

06:47.898 --> 06:49.831
No, I only do fake vintage. Less smelly.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.333
How about an independent bookstore?

06:51.368 --> 06:52.707
Oh, that's be so cute.

06:52.732 --> 06:54.450
You could be like Meg
Ryan in "You've Got Mail."

06:54.475 --> 06:57.072
- What about a yoga studio?
- No. Pilates.

06:57.107 --> 07:00.653
Pilates is out, so it's
gonna be in again real soon.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.781
Okay, well, I hear what you're saying.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.494
- Mom! Come on!
- Mom, I'm going to Jade's.

07:07.518 --> 07:09.751
Do you need... Yes.
No. It's fine, sweetie.

07:09.787 --> 07:11.486
You know, I just don't understand

07:11.522 --> 07:13.889
how the stone for my counter-top
doesn't exist anymore.

07:13.924 --> 07:15.835
It's out of stock, so we're
gonna have to move on to plan B.

07:15.859 --> 07:18.193
Mom, Clark is making s'mores!
I don't want to be late.

07:18.228 --> 07:19.828
He'll eat all of them.

07:19.863 --> 07:21.430
I promise you we will get there.

07:21.465 --> 07:23.076
Okay, but the thing
is... BunBun? Bun-Bun!

07:23.100 --> 07:25.133
- Awesome.
- Grandpa, I'm right here.

07:25.169 --> 07:27.213
I'm also Bun-Bun, honey. Dad,
I thought you were resting.

07:27.237 --> 07:28.778
How late are you gonna be out tonight?

07:28.803 --> 07:30.939
Not late. 11-ish or
something like that.

07:30.974 --> 07:32.507
Wait. What were we just talking about?

07:32.543 --> 07:33.763
We can move forward.

07:33.788 --> 07:35.474
Tomorrow I'm gonna bring
you some counter-top...

07:35.499 --> 07:37.490
Okay, and how is that
gonna affect our timeline?

07:37.514 --> 07:39.147
A week, maybe, but I will do my best

07:39.183 --> 07:40.549
to get you back on schedule, Abby.

07:40.584 --> 07:42.284
Bun-Bun, don't miss your curfew.

07:42.319 --> 07:44.594
You know how it worries your mom.

07:48.118 --> 07:50.117
Dad, Mom's not here anymore.

07:51.929 --> 07:55.797
Right. Whoops.

07:55.833 --> 07:57.664
I'm a little scattered these days.

07:57.689 --> 07:59.469
- Okay.
- Oh.

07:59.494 --> 08:04.258
Um, all right, so Lilly, uh...

08:04.575 --> 08:06.808
you are driving to Jade's, right?

08:06.844 --> 08:08.443
Yeah, I'm gonna drop Charlie off.

08:08.479 --> 08:13.539
Excellent. And here is the diet...

08:13.977 --> 08:16.777
Well, I'd prefer Zero, but whatever.

08:16.802 --> 08:19.803
Um, all right, well,
that is what we have.

08:19.828 --> 08:22.444
Hey. How much longer is your break?

08:22.469 --> 08:24.059
Because my dad is up,

08:24.094 --> 08:25.422
and I think he's having a
little bit of an episode.

08:25.447 --> 08:26.679
14 more minutes.

08:28.232 --> 08:29.898
Okay.

08:29.933 --> 08:32.267
Well, breaks are important. Enjoy that.

08:32.302 --> 08:34.523
Charlie, don't leave yet.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.371
Give me a hug.

08:36.405 --> 08:38.006
- I love you.
- I love you too.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.553
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Okay.

08:39.578 --> 08:41.510
You... are you sleeping at Jade's?

08:41.544 --> 08:44.485
Um, yeah, for a couple nights.

08:44.729 --> 08:46.219
A couple of nights?

08:47.584 --> 08:48.867
It's a lot here.

08:48.892 --> 08:51.920
I just... it's becoming so
much, I just... I need to...

08:51.955 --> 08:53.622
I know, honey. I feel the same way.

08:53.657 --> 08:56.057
It's very chaotic, but it's temporary,

08:56.093 --> 08:57.399
and it's gonna settle down.

08:57.424 --> 08:59.578
When? It's not gonna
settle. You don't do settled.

09:23.423 --> 09:26.141
Well, I think Mr.
Back-from-the-Past is Marco.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.500
A lot of unfinished business there.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.897
Wait, which one is he again?

09:28.922 --> 09:30.805
Oh, he's the alcoholic with
the braids, the urban farmer.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.360
- Yeah, a little preachy, right?
- Way preachy.

09:33.385 --> 09:35.149
Okay, I think the guessing portion

09:35.174 --> 09:36.531
of the evening has now come to an end.

09:36.556 --> 09:37.722
So, thank you.

09:38.094 --> 09:39.524
I want you to meet Keiko.

09:39.549 --> 09:41.172
- Oh!
- Where is she? Keiko? Keiko.

09:41.197 --> 09:43.379
Keiko, come. Come, meet my friends.

09:43.404 --> 09:44.824
- Oh, hi.
- This is Keiko.

09:44.849 --> 09:46.015
She's from Nagasaki.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.816
Ah.

09:53.746 --> 09:56.011
Phoebe has been such nice friend.

09:56.036 --> 09:58.169
She has the clap for me.

09:58.371 --> 10:00.988
- You gave Keiko the clap?
- No, I did not give Keiko the clap.

10:01.013 --> 10:04.519
I think it just means I'm being
supportive, and it's funny. Bye.

10:04.644 --> 10:06.619
- Bye.
- Hi. Hey.

10:06.655 --> 10:08.332
- Hey.
- How's the kitchen going?

10:08.357 --> 10:10.863
Oh, the kitchen is coming
slowly, but we're getting there.

10:10.888 --> 10:12.754
- Slowly.
- Yeah. Abby deserves a medal.

10:12.762 --> 10:14.996
She is the most patient
client I've ever had.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.964
Oh, that's our Abs.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.332
How is Papa McCarthy doing?

10:18.363 --> 10:20.430
Uh, he's... you know,
it wasn't his best night.

10:20.466 --> 10:21.394
Drink?

10:21.419 --> 10:24.229
Yes. It's just, you
know, ever since the fire,

10:24.254 --> 10:25.332
it's been hard to find a medicine

10:25.356 --> 10:27.189
that works for him again.

10:27.224 --> 10:29.458
The mini-stroke just really
screwed everything up.

10:29.493 --> 10:31.960
He mentioned my mom as if
she was still here, and...

10:31.996 --> 10:33.856
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. That's tough.

10:35.184 --> 10:41.303
But let us put the kibosh on
the sick dad, dead mom chitchat.

10:41.338 --> 10:43.138
It's a party.

10:43.173 --> 10:46.808
Where is this Keiko that
I have heard so much about?

10:46.844 --> 10:50.278
She is such a powerful spirit, that one.

10:50.314 --> 10:52.895
- Sushi. You okay?
- You all right?

10:54.351 --> 10:55.984
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.543
You sure? I heard you had a bit

10:57.568 --> 10:58.998
of a fainting spell
today during mediation.

10:59.023 --> 11:01.123
- Delia.
- Fainting spell?

11:01.158 --> 11:03.136
No, no, that's... see, that's
typical lawyer hyperbole.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.205
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's
just a little stomach bug.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.295
Well, you know the
norovirus is going around.

11:07.331 --> 11:08.445
You need to be careful.

11:08.470 --> 11:11.444
Well, maybe you're dehydrated.
Did you drink enough water?

11:11.468 --> 11:12.834
Maybe you're with child.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.436
- Oh.
- Oh, jeez.

11:14.471 --> 11:18.073
Oh, she's messing with you, D. Come on.

11:18.108 --> 11:19.687
That's hilarious.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.144
Why don't we get back to
guessing Phoebe's ex-lovers.

11:22.179 --> 11:23.843
- That was fun.
- No, it wasn't.

11:23.868 --> 11:25.534
Why are we guessing your ex-lovers?

11:25.559 --> 11:27.916
Jo and Phoebe got tarot card readings.

11:27.951 --> 11:29.875
A man from Phoebe's life is coming back.

11:29.900 --> 11:30.992
We're trying to guess who.

11:31.017 --> 11:33.255
- Oh, well, Ralph...
- Mm, nope.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.856
- Obviously, 100%.
- No.

11:34.892 --> 11:36.491
Don't want that one back in my life.

11:36.527 --> 11:38.371
Why don't we just talk about
your tarot card reading?

11:38.395 --> 11:40.095
It was much more fascinating than mine.

11:40.130 --> 11:41.274
Oh. Yeah. I'll have to agree with that.

11:41.298 --> 11:42.531
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:42.566 --> 11:44.332
Are you really considering it?

11:44.368 --> 11:45.579
Considering what?

11:45.604 --> 11:47.914
There's the building... right
next Rise is up for lease,

11:47.938 --> 11:49.438
and I might open up another business.

11:49.473 --> 11:51.173
I don't know. But it's not definite.

11:51.208 --> 11:52.208
- Wow.
- I have to do

11:52.242 --> 11:53.305
some number crunching,

11:53.330 --> 11:54.618
but I don't know if I can afford it.

11:54.643 --> 11:56.043
- Yeah.
- So...

11:56.188 --> 12:00.172
- Well, I have money. Need a loan?
- Wow.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.344
- You pulling my leg?
- No. Anything you need.

12:02.369 --> 12:04.286
Look, no strings.

12:04.321 --> 12:06.455
So it'd be more of a gift than a loan.

12:06.490 --> 12:07.438
Okay.

12:07.463 --> 12:09.547
You don't even know the
business I'm investing in.

12:09.572 --> 12:11.083
I don't even know the
business I'm getting.

12:11.108 --> 12:13.139
What if it ends up being a brothel?

12:13.163 --> 12:14.258
- Oh...
- Good.

12:14.298 --> 12:17.032
- I can see the headlines.
- It's a great spot, right?

12:17.067 --> 12:18.507
I want to get in on the ground floor.

12:18.535 --> 12:20.910
This is how investments are made, Jo.

12:20.935 --> 12:22.935
You trust the talent.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.716
That's very, very sweet, A.
I'll have to think about it.

12:26.174 --> 12:27.419
Okay. The offer stands.

12:27.444 --> 12:30.487
Well, I need a real drink.
You got the heavy stuff inside?

12:30.511 --> 12:31.740
Oh, yeah. In the back.

12:31.765 --> 12:33.931
- Oh, all right.
- That sounds good. Excuse me.

12:36.576 --> 12:39.118
- Danger, Will Robinson.
- Talking about a boyfriend.

12:39.153 --> 12:41.287
- That is a big deal.
- Are you kidding me with that?

12:41.322 --> 12:43.989
You guys, I'm not gonna
take money from him, come on.

12:44.025 --> 12:45.491
I learned the hard way with Frumpkis.

12:45.526 --> 12:47.426
We invested in Rise.
Where did that end up?

12:47.461 --> 12:48.961
- New Mexico.
- New Mexico.

12:48.996 --> 12:50.563
Thank you. So it's a very sweet offer,

12:50.598 --> 12:52.676
and I appreciate his generous
behavior, don't we, D.?

12:52.700 --> 12:54.233
- You all right?
- You okay?

12:54.268 --> 12:56.361
- What's going on?
- What? Yeah.

12:56.637 --> 12:58.611
I'm fine. I am fine.

12:59.707 --> 13:01.273
Excuse me.

13:01.309 --> 13:02.575
Bathroom.
- Oh, yikes.

13:02.610 --> 13:04.626
- Ooh.
- Shit, norovirus.

13:05.213 --> 13:06.657
I kissed her on the
lips when I got here.

13:06.681 --> 13:09.014
- I know, 'cause you're dirty.
- Yeah.

13:13.088 --> 13:14.187
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

13:17.678 --> 13:20.879
There you are. I've
been looking for you.

13:20.904 --> 13:24.205
Sorry. I needed an introvert break.

13:24.230 --> 13:25.540
Yeah, I hear that.

13:27.102 --> 13:30.136
Are you okay? You seem off.

13:31.775 --> 13:34.273
Abby's not giving you
grief about oven knobs...

13:34.308 --> 13:35.821
You know, can you just lay off Abby?

13:40.699 --> 13:42.699
I'm sorry, babe.

13:45.133 --> 13:48.024
Look, it's just... being
around Abby's dad all day,

13:48.049 --> 13:49.235
watching him...

13:50.839 --> 13:54.975
You know, when he realizes his
wife is gone all over again...

13:58.031 --> 14:00.398
It makes you think of your wife.

14:03.735 --> 14:05.063
Baby...

14:06.083 --> 14:07.595
it must be tough.

14:08.658 --> 14:10.157
Triggering.

14:14.132 --> 14:17.227
Well, I'm gonna go get another drink.

14:17.792 --> 14:19.181
Would you like a refill?

14:19.569 --> 14:21.122
No, I'm fine.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.200
- Ha ha, you're gonna love it.
- Yeah.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.005
Well, just calm down.

14:38.030 --> 14:40.074
- Don't jump to conclusions.
- No, I'm already jumping.

14:40.099 --> 14:43.319
I can't be pregnant?

14:43.344 --> 14:45.477
What? I was kidding before.

14:45.513 --> 14:48.314
Yeah, well, I'm not, okay?
Oh, my God, I am spinning out.

14:48.349 --> 14:50.093
Yeah, when I was pregnant with
Zooey, I was spinning out too.

14:50.117 --> 14:51.550
Boy, I was

14:51.585 --> 14:53.385
- No? Okay, Jo.
- It was bad. It was bad.

14:53.421 --> 14:55.354
- Jo, that is not helping.
- I'm sick, fatigued.

14:55.389 --> 14:57.059
I missed a period, and I am never late.

14:57.425 --> 14:59.325
Delia, you just got to get a grip.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.338
We can leave right now, go
get a test, figure it out.

15:01.362 --> 15:03.662
I can't. Paul's got his
first city council debate

15:03.698 --> 15:05.559
in a couple of days, and I got to focus.

15:07.589 --> 15:10.223
Well, if I am, I'll
just take care of it.

15:10.438 --> 15:12.271
- Okay.
- All right.

15:12.306 --> 15:14.440
Well, we'll be here for
you. Whatever you need.

15:14.475 --> 15:15.514
- Thank you.
- Yep.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.043
I have to go. Tell
Keiko I said sayonara.

15:18.079 --> 15:19.928
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.

15:20.314 --> 15:22.081
- Any takers?
- Yeah, I'll have one.

15:22.116 --> 15:24.249
- All right, great.
- That is so cute.

15:24.285 --> 15:26.118
Thank you!

15:26.153 --> 15:28.538
Excuse me. Why is Lena
setting up PR meetings

15:28.563 --> 15:29.963
for the end of the week?

15:30.374 --> 15:32.491
Because I asked her to.

15:32.526 --> 15:34.241
Can you put your phone
down? We're at a party.

15:34.266 --> 15:38.155
Yes, I know, and I'm sorry,
but I am feeling undermined.

15:38.249 --> 15:41.250
This e-mail does not
reflect the conversations

15:41.275 --> 15:43.512
that we've had on this topic at all.

15:43.537 --> 15:47.106
They're just meetings,
and can we not with

15:47.141 --> 15:49.491
the "Dr. Blaker Communications"
bullshit right now?

15:51.065 --> 15:52.069
We're gonna go.

15:52.094 --> 15:53.561
Yeah, we're gonna hit the road.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.918
Great idea.
- Okay.

15:54.943 --> 15:56.409
Oh, are you guys leaving?

15:56.717 --> 15:58.417
Yeah, it was a great party, Phoebe.

15:58.452 --> 16:00.018
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

16:00.054 --> 16:02.154
Okay, well, I'll walk you guys out.

16:02.189 --> 16:03.897
It's late. I'm just gonna
hitch a ride with these guys.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.858
- Abby...
- It's fine. I get it. You're right.

16:05.883 --> 16:09.218
You know, we said we would not
discuss this tonight, so, okay.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.133
I will call you tomorrow.

16:14.158 --> 16:15.764
- Counter-tops.
- Counter tops.

16:17.787 --> 16:20.467
- Don't say it, please.
- What?

16:20.492 --> 16:22.125
I thought she was tough on you.

16:22.150 --> 16:24.327
Uh-huh. Shall we?

16:24.957 --> 16:27.725
Sure. I'll drop you off.

16:29.608 --> 16:31.413
I thought we were doing
your place tonight.

16:31.894 --> 16:33.303
Yeah.

16:34.267 --> 16:37.202
No, I need to be by myself tonight.

16:37.323 --> 16:38.553
Solo.

16:39.860 --> 16:40.860
You okay with that?

16:40.895 --> 16:43.395
Yeah, absolutely.

16:55.629 --> 16:56.819
Ugh.

16:58.481 --> 17:00.232
Bun-Bun.

17:02.316 --> 17:03.682
- Oh.
- Sweetie.

17:03.717 --> 17:05.451
- Oh, God.
- Oh, there you are.

17:05.486 --> 17:07.386
I just wanted to make
sure you got back safe.

17:07.421 --> 17:10.589
Why are you awake? It's late.

17:10.624 --> 17:11.960
Ah, well...

17:13.359 --> 17:15.359
Hmm.

17:17.117 --> 17:20.098
Okay. We're gonna get
you to the guesthouse.

17:20.134 --> 17:22.234
Oh, no, not that cell
you call a guesthouse.

17:23.086 --> 17:24.569
It was too hot.

17:24.605 --> 17:26.483
Well, lower the temperature,
or ask the nurse to.

17:26.507 --> 17:27.992
This is why we got a live-in.

17:28.018 --> 17:31.102
Yeah, but she's asleep. And she snores.

17:31.127 --> 17:33.795
Like an elephant.

17:34.348 --> 17:36.582
Now come on, tell me all
about this party tonight.

17:36.617 --> 17:38.728
It was at Marjorie Lancaster's, right?

17:39.380 --> 17:42.114
I haven't seen Marjorie
Lancaster in 30 years.

17:42.139 --> 17:43.924
Oh, no. What happened?

17:44.325 --> 17:46.416
We graduated high school.

17:47.932 --> 17:49.294
Marjorie?

17:49.330 --> 17:51.236
High... high school. Yeah.

17:51.261 --> 17:54.128
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

17:54.153 --> 17:57.821
Hey, Abby, why don't we
go through your yearbooks?

17:58.205 --> 18:01.139
- Dad, it's late, and...
- Come on. Don't be a killjoy.

18:01.175 --> 18:03.175
We'll wake up Max. He'll
get a kick out of this.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.444
- Max doesn't live here...
- We could have some cocoa,

18:05.479 --> 18:07.346
and we'll stay up late.

18:07.381 --> 18:08.914
Just don't tell your mother.

18:08.949 --> 18:10.849
She's not gonna be so
thrilled about this.

18:10.885 --> 18:13.191
We'll just keep this
our little secret, okay?

18:13.245 --> 18:14.840
Our little secret.

18:15.355 --> 18:18.089
- It's not okay.
- What's not okay?

18:19.436 --> 18:22.003
This arrangement.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.439
It's not good for you, Dad.

18:27.112 --> 18:29.412
Cocoa. Marshmallows.

18:29.437 --> 18:31.336
That's your favorite, right?

18:31.372 --> 18:34.172
Come on. Let's watch a video tape.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.607
We'll watch a movie, huh?

18:35.632 --> 18:37.017
Yeah.

19:05.045 --> 19:09.217
_

19:25.561 --> 19:28.216
"Shine" with a "Y" instead
of an "I." You get it?

19:28.241 --> 19:29.641
- "Rise and Shyne"?
- Yeah.

19:29.676 --> 19:31.303
- That's clever.
- Hit me at 3:00 a.m.

19:31.827 --> 19:34.795
I almost broke my neck stumbling
around in the dark for a pen,

19:34.830 --> 19:37.131
kind of like Benjamin Franklin
with the kite thing, huh?

19:37.166 --> 19:39.066
You're comparing your juice bar idea

19:39.101 --> 19:40.567
to the discovery of electricity?

19:40.603 --> 19:42.403
No, no, no. It's not just a juice bar.

19:42.438 --> 19:44.471
It is a juicing experience.

19:44.507 --> 19:47.756
You see, juices, infusions,
omega this, omega that.

19:47.781 --> 19:50.611
We'll have mindfulness
seminars and books.

19:50.646 --> 19:51.951
And here's the slogan:

19:52.071 --> 19:56.027
"You come to Shyne, we will add
a year to your life minimum."

19:56.052 --> 19:59.053
- I'm not sure we can guarantee that.
- We'll workshop it.

19:59.088 --> 20:00.420
I thought you were excited about this.

20:00.445 --> 20:02.134
The other day with Phoebe,
you were doing cartwheels.

20:02.158 --> 20:03.490
I know, and I didn't think

20:03.526 --> 20:05.014
that you would take it seriously.

20:05.039 --> 20:06.650
I mean, you thought
tarot cards were dumb.

20:06.686 --> 20:08.586
Screw all that. This isn't about fate.

20:08.621 --> 20:11.842
This is about us, this is
about diving into something new.

20:12.412 --> 20:17.738
- Can we afford it?
- Well, it's a stretch, yeah.

20:17.763 --> 20:20.926
You know, a new lease and
start-up costs and all that,

20:20.951 --> 20:22.600
but we're entrepreneurial bitches.

20:22.635 --> 20:25.302
We can pull this off.
Launching a new business,

20:25.338 --> 20:28.772
it just, I don't know, sounds risky.

20:28.808 --> 20:31.075
Yeah, it's a risk, it's a challenge,

20:31.110 --> 20:32.843
but that might not be such a bad thing.

20:32.878 --> 20:34.712
What's that thing they
say about the sharks?

20:34.747 --> 20:36.058
They have to keep swimming forward.

20:36.082 --> 20:38.107
If they stop, they're gonna explode.

20:39.585 --> 20:41.185
That sounds inaccurate.

20:41.865 --> 20:44.254
And you're not a shark.
You're a human lady.

20:44.412 --> 20:46.890
You can swim in place for a little.

20:46.926 --> 20:49.293
Maybe I'm one of those people
that can't swim in place,

20:49.328 --> 20:53.053
because the moment you
start coasting, bam.

20:53.910 --> 20:55.014
It's a heart attack.

20:56.202 --> 20:59.570
Like Abby's mom? You're not her.

20:59.605 --> 21:01.891
It's up to you, but
you're in a good place.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.975
I don't want to see you
knock yourself off course.

21:05.542 --> 21:08.843
Zooey, baby. I won't.

21:17.988 --> 21:20.724
Excuse me. How much is this piece?

21:20.760 --> 21:22.993
Oh, the Jared Frank. $230.

21:23.029 --> 21:24.659
$230.

21:25.231 --> 21:26.797
$150?

21:26.832 --> 21:28.699
Can't go below $200. Sorry.

21:28.734 --> 21:31.935
I'll take it for $210.

21:31.971 --> 21:33.417
Damien.

21:33.839 --> 21:36.740
- Phoebe Conte. Look at you.
- Hello.

21:36.776 --> 21:39.743
It's so funny to run into
you in such a random place.

21:39.779 --> 21:41.723
Well, I like to browse all
over. It keeps me fresh.

21:41.747 --> 21:43.814
And I am a big fan of Jared Frank.

21:43.849 --> 21:46.316
- It looks beautiful.
- I'll sell it for $210.

21:46.352 --> 21:48.315
- Perfect.
- $220.

21:50.690 --> 21:51.755
- $250.
- $260.

21:51.791 --> 21:52.956
- $270.
- $280.

21:52.992 --> 21:54.258
$290.

21:54.293 --> 21:56.760
- Too rich for my blood.
- Okay.

21:56.796 --> 21:58.377
I'll wrap it up for $290, then.

21:59.237 --> 22:01.065
You had no intention of buying, did you?

22:01.100 --> 22:02.666
You just ran the price up, you minx.

22:02.702 --> 22:04.338
Well, I guess you'll never know.

22:05.938 --> 22:08.672
Well, it's nice to see
you, Phoebe. You seem good.

22:08.708 --> 22:12.076
I... I am. I feel good.

22:12.111 --> 22:13.299
Good.

22:13.779 --> 22:17.283
Damien, can I buy you a coffee?

22:17.950 --> 22:22.219
I would love to learn more about
your Jared Frank collection.

22:22.254 --> 22:24.088
He wants to hire me back.

22:24.123 --> 22:26.090
- Way to go.
- He knows I'm serious.

22:26.125 --> 22:29.226
It's part-time, trial basis,
but it's very exciting.

22:29.261 --> 22:30.505
Wow.

22:30.544 --> 22:33.397
Okay, well, I will take
you to see the lounge area.

22:33.432 --> 22:35.299
It's where our residents
like to hang out,

22:35.334 --> 22:38.135
mingle, you know, shoot the shit.

22:38.170 --> 22:40.904
We call it the socialization corner.

22:42.685 --> 22:43.929
Busts out with "shoot the shit."

22:43.953 --> 22:45.263
Who says that anymore these days?

22:45.287 --> 22:47.032
Well, I'm more concerned
with "socialization corner,"

22:47.056 --> 22:49.090
because it sounds like
that part of the maze

22:49.115 --> 22:50.714
where the rats bump into each other.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.416
Stop it. This place is really nice.

22:52.444 --> 22:53.732
It was a great recommendation from Mike.

22:53.757 --> 22:55.468
I know, it was very nice,
and he's been through this

22:55.493 --> 22:57.177
with his parents, so
he knows it's tough.

22:57.202 --> 22:59.002
First contact since the funeral?

22:59.027 --> 23:00.404
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

23:00.451 --> 23:03.668
We've had some good text,
e-mail exchange, back and forth.

23:03.693 --> 23:05.826
It's very healthy. In a nice place.

23:05.861 --> 23:07.828
What's happening with
Delia and her situation?

23:07.863 --> 23:09.808
Yeah, no, I spoke to her.
She hasn't taken the test yet.

23:09.832 --> 23:11.130
I think she's a little scared.

23:11.505 --> 23:14.335
- Ah. Hey.
- Hi.

23:14.370 --> 23:15.714
Did you want to meet
some of our residents?

23:15.738 --> 23:17.122
Um, yeah. Let's just mingle it up.

23:17.147 --> 23:22.386
Go shoot the shit with
them. Okay. Oh, boy.

23:22.411 --> 23:25.240
Okay. Don't tell Abby,

23:25.501 --> 23:27.468
but I think this place
needs a decorator.

23:27.683 --> 23:28.882
I live at the Paradiso.

23:28.918 --> 23:30.325
This is like the Taj Mahal to me.

23:30.350 --> 23:32.283
I mean, just maybe a few more paintings.

23:32.308 --> 23:34.475
That is a great idea.

23:35.044 --> 23:37.391
- What?
- Project. Charitable.

23:37.426 --> 23:39.627
It would be great PR for the gallery.

23:39.662 --> 23:41.729
I'm gonna pitch it to Damien.

23:41.764 --> 23:43.631
Can I say how perfect it is that the man

23:43.666 --> 23:46.500
from your past turned out
to be a gay art dealer?

23:46.535 --> 23:48.502
I cannot tell you how relieved

23:48.537 --> 23:50.704
I am that it isn't one of my exes.

23:50.740 --> 23:54.357
- Mm, they were a freaky bunch.
- Thank you.

23:54.382 --> 23:56.549
- You're welcome.
- No. You know what?

23:56.574 --> 23:58.061
For the first time in my life,

23:58.396 --> 24:00.514
I feel like I am in the driver's seat.

24:00.549 --> 24:01.827
- Oh.
- And it feels really good.

24:01.851 --> 24:03.284
Well, I'm glad that homeless woman

24:03.319 --> 24:04.795
with the dirty tarot cards agreed.

24:04.820 --> 24:07.621
What about you? You made
any moves on the building?

24:07.657 --> 24:09.523
I don't know.

24:09.558 --> 24:11.436
No, I don't know if I'm
gonna go along with it now.

24:11.460 --> 24:12.865
I thought you were so excited about it.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.973
Well, my genius kid, she
talked some sense into me,

24:14.997 --> 24:16.475
and just... opening up
a business right now,

24:16.499 --> 24:17.609
I don't know if it's the right time.

24:17.633 --> 24:19.967
- Okay.
- Hey.

24:20.010 --> 24:21.576
How are you doing? How are you feeling?

24:21.604 --> 24:23.337
I'm good. You know, I met a man

24:23.372 --> 24:24.738
who used to sell encyclopedias.

24:24.774 --> 24:27.474
Very retro. My dad would love it.

24:27.510 --> 24:28.854
Well, shall we check out the rec room?

24:28.878 --> 24:30.311
- Ooh.
- Let's do it.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.000
She's our most dedicated performer.

24:54.035 --> 24:55.067
- Oh. -
Mm-hmm.

24:55.103 --> 24:56.335
Tap time before nap time.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.937
Mm-hmm.

25:01.614 --> 25:03.448
Abby. Abby. What is wrong?

25:03.483 --> 25:05.534
I'm not leaving my dad in this place.

25:05.559 --> 25:06.792
Okay. You need to calm down.

25:06.827 --> 25:08.260
Was it the tap dancing?

25:08.296 --> 25:09.539
Did you see what was going on in there?

25:09.563 --> 25:11.463
That was so bleak. That was crazy.

25:11.499 --> 25:13.377
That was like something
out of a David Lynch movie.

25:13.401 --> 25:14.525
It could have been worse.
Could have been a mime.

25:14.550 --> 25:15.768
Half those people in that room looked

25:15.793 --> 25:17.197
- like they were dead already.
- No...

25:17.222 --> 25:19.135
The other half looked like
they wished they were dead.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.103
That isn't true.

25:20.128 --> 25:22.341
I would literally be the worst
daughter if I left my dad here.

25:22.376 --> 25:23.244
Oh, stop that.

25:23.269 --> 25:25.313
You're an amazing daughter
who's doing your best,

25:25.338 --> 25:27.330
but you have to do what's right
for all of you... for the kids.

25:27.355 --> 25:28.736
I just want to go.
Can we please just go?

25:28.761 --> 25:29.860
- Yes.
- Sure, sure, sure.

25:29.885 --> 25:31.502
I don't want to be here.

25:34.643 --> 25:37.645
And despite what my opponent says,

25:37.680 --> 25:40.325
I believe that carbon emission
is a municipal issue.

25:40.349 --> 25:43.250
We have to shape the future of our kids.

25:43.286 --> 25:47.407
Uh... we have to shape... the future

25:47.432 --> 25:49.564
for the next generation...
is it too strident?

25:50.726 --> 25:53.971
No, no. It's great.
It's very strong. Um...

25:54.853 --> 25:57.198
Let's switch it up.

25:57.233 --> 25:59.393
- Curveball it.
- Mm.

26:00.903 --> 26:02.536
Mr. Cordero,

26:02.572 --> 26:05.713
what's your position on
a woman's right to choose?

26:06.209 --> 26:09.476
Too chose what, Miss Banai?
What jacket goes with that top?

26:09.512 --> 26:11.245
- Paul, be serious.
- What?

26:11.280 --> 26:13.147
It's a city council race.

26:13.182 --> 26:15.078
Those issues almost never come up.

26:15.103 --> 26:16.495
Almost? You want to get caught

26:16.520 --> 26:17.797
with your pants down in front of voters?

26:17.822 --> 26:19.620
Okay. You want to know my answer?

26:19.655 --> 26:23.947
I was raised Catholic, so
that explains my approach.

26:25.094 --> 26:26.416
Oh.

26:26.996 --> 26:30.030
Okay, then. So you
don't believe in choice?

26:30.066 --> 26:32.814
I believe that life
starts at conception.

26:33.202 --> 26:34.313
You didn't answer the question.

26:34.337 --> 26:36.170
Okay, do I think that

26:36.205 --> 26:37.683
the government should be
de-funding Planned Parenthood?

26:37.707 --> 26:39.607
- No.
- Wow, how generous of you.

26:39.642 --> 26:43.712
It's a complicated
issue, Delia. It's tricky.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.415
Yeah.

26:47.450 --> 26:48.892
It is.

26:49.518 --> 26:51.032
You okay?

26:53.905 --> 26:55.571
I'm fine.

26:56.259 --> 26:58.150
You just need to finesse your answer,

26:58.175 --> 27:00.180
in case it comes up.

27:03.985 --> 27:06.133
So what does tomorrow look like?

27:06.168 --> 27:08.068
Uh, pretty open.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.919
Just a few PR interviews after lunch.

27:09.944 --> 27:12.040
Do you want me to confirm any of them?

27:12.475 --> 27:15.542
No. Push them... all.

27:15.578 --> 27:17.411
Okay.

27:20.043 --> 27:22.043
_

27:24.620 --> 27:27.054
So I just pushed the meetings.

27:27.089 --> 27:28.478
Why, Barbara?

27:28.503 --> 27:33.704
Because it's easier just to do
what Abby wants... avoid judgment.

27:33.729 --> 27:35.329
It's exhausting. I'm exhausted.

27:35.364 --> 27:37.131
It makes me feel so...

27:37.166 --> 27:39.166
What? How does it make you feel?

27:39.201 --> 27:40.701
Worthless.

27:40.736 --> 27:45.272
Like every thought I
have, every decision,

27:45.308 --> 27:46.884
is wrong... probably wrong.

27:46.909 --> 27:50.644
And the truth is, I thought we'd
have more advertisers by now,

27:50.680 --> 27:53.247
but instead of giving me support,

27:53.282 --> 27:55.049
all I get is criticism.

27:55.084 --> 27:57.751
My whole life, I've never been enough.

27:57.787 --> 27:59.553
I wasn't enough for my ex,

27:59.588 --> 28:04.158
and now here we are leaving
someone wanting again.

28:04.193 --> 28:07.962
Mm-hmm. Abby, how does
all that make you feel?

28:09.993 --> 28:12.181
I'm sorry, can you just
repeat what you said?

28:12.228 --> 28:13.931
- Seriously?
- Well...

28:13.956 --> 28:16.196
- Wow.
- It's just been long...

28:16.221 --> 28:18.933
It is the perfect
metaphor for our situation.

28:18.969 --> 28:20.947
Abby only hears her side of the
conflict, it's like I don't...

28:20.971 --> 28:23.237
I had to take a tour of a
nursing home today, you know,

28:23.273 --> 28:25.626
'cause I might have to put
him in there... my dad...

28:25.658 --> 28:27.602
And that is extremely...

28:27.796 --> 28:31.228
- Here we go with her feelings.
- My feelings. Wow, Barbara.

28:31.253 --> 28:34.387
I am so sorry that you had
to move a few meetings today.

28:34.412 --> 28:36.757
My situation with my father is...

28:36.782 --> 28:38.086
Okay, so you were listening.

28:38.121 --> 28:39.854
Hmm? I mean, that's something, isn't it?

28:39.889 --> 28:42.724
Oh, my God, shut up.
Abby, I am sympathetic

28:42.759 --> 28:44.270
to what you're going
through with your father...

28:44.294 --> 28:46.194
- Right.
- I am, but it is difficult

28:46.229 --> 28:49.167
to walk on eggshells
around you all of the time.

28:49.192 --> 28:52.573
It makes it challenging for me
to feel anything, to push back...

28:52.598 --> 28:53.964
You push back plenty. Believe me.

28:53.989 --> 28:56.856
And so do you, about everything.

28:56.881 --> 28:59.284
You can't let go of a
single detail or decision...

28:59.309 --> 29:01.300
Oh, my God. I can think of
ten things that I've let go of,

29:01.325 --> 29:04.045
and all I want is for
this site to be perfect.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.425
Is that so wrong?

29:05.450 --> 29:07.355
- Abby, let's explore that
word right now: "perfect."

29:07.380 --> 29:09.951
I put my blood, sweat, and tears...

29:09.986 --> 29:11.319
- I know.
- Into this site.

29:11.354 --> 29:12.954
- And I haven't?
- I didn't say that.

29:12.989 --> 29:14.467
I am bleeding out for this damn thing.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.057
- I never said that.
- What would happen

29:16.092 --> 29:18.068
if Barbara made all the decisions?

29:18.093 --> 29:21.763
What are you so afraid
of? The site might fail?

29:21.798 --> 29:24.265
Yes! Or, I mean, no. Not that...

29:24.300 --> 29:26.381
Here's the real issue.
She doesn't respect me.

29:26.406 --> 29:28.369
- No.
- You never treated me...

29:28.405 --> 29:30.204
You've never treated me as an equal.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.306
- I sought you out. Wow.
- Never have, Never will.

29:32.342 --> 29:33.819
She doesn't even listen to
anything that I'm saying.

29:33.843 --> 29:35.121
And by the way, truth be told...

29:35.145 --> 29:36.911
Not one word is she listening to.

29:36.946 --> 29:39.280
She just interrupts... it's
like I'm not even talking.

29:39.315 --> 29:41.115
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

29:41.151 --> 29:42.984
- You disrespect me.
- Disrespect her?

29:43.019 --> 29:45.350
Jesus, Jake, would you just let me talk?

29:49.989 --> 29:52.589
Sorry, who's Jake?

29:52.797 --> 29:54.696
- My ex-husband.
- Her ex-husband.

29:54.771 --> 29:59.436
Oh. Oh. Okay.

29:59.461 --> 30:02.403
Abby, the hour's not over yet.

30:02.439 --> 30:04.272
Yes. It's over.

30:10.546 --> 30:13.413
By the way, you hear
about the place next door?

30:13.449 --> 30:16.505
Uh, no. What do you know?

30:16.530 --> 30:18.967
Glenn just leased it to a PB&J shop.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.289
- PB&J... J as in jelly?
- Yeah, jelly.

30:22.324 --> 30:25.356
But also the guy's name
is Jay. It's awesome, huh?

30:25.381 --> 30:27.405
Who wants to go to a store for
that? What, bread, spread, eat?

30:27.429 --> 30:28.990
Apparently they got
stores in Silver Lake

30:29.015 --> 30:30.997
and Pasadena already. Huge hits.

30:31.033 --> 30:33.092
Very, very popular with the children.

30:33.535 --> 30:35.280
Yeah, you know what? I had
the exact same reaction,

30:35.304 --> 30:37.545
but they ain't open yet, Jo.

30:37.973 --> 30:39.506
Welcome, everyone, to the first

30:39.541 --> 30:41.441
of many city council debates.

30:41.477 --> 30:43.443
Let's bring our candidates to the stage.

30:43.479 --> 30:46.746
First up, Thomas Divoll.

30:46.782 --> 30:50.826
- You okay?
- Huh? Yeah.

30:51.386 --> 30:52.752
'Cause you don't seem okay.

30:53.030 --> 30:55.889
I'm fine.

30:55.924 --> 30:57.757
It's about what I said
yesterday, isn't it?

30:57.793 --> 30:59.626
- Oh, Paul...
- About my stance on abortion?

30:59.661 --> 31:01.838
- Shh.
- What?

31:01.863 --> 31:02.928
You are surrounded by the enemy.

31:02.952 --> 31:04.808
Somebody might hear you.

31:05.188 --> 31:08.784
And if that's what you believe...

31:09.159 --> 31:10.558
It is.

31:10.583 --> 31:13.127
But I don't want it to
become a thing between us.

31:13.163 --> 31:15.063
And you believing differently...

31:15.098 --> 31:16.497
Look, I get it.

31:16.533 --> 31:18.066
I get the other side, Delia,

31:18.101 --> 31:19.879
but it doesn't change
the way I feel about you,

31:19.903 --> 31:21.547
and I hope it doesn't
change the way you feel...

31:21.571 --> 31:24.069
- I might be pregnant.
- Paul Cordero.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.782
Good luck, sir.

31:36.286 --> 31:40.221
Well... Jesus, I'm so sorry
there's so much going on here.

31:40.256 --> 31:42.074
It's very hectic.

31:43.126 --> 31:45.074
A lot going on in general, huh?

31:45.374 --> 31:46.793
Yeah.

31:48.098 --> 31:49.831
Thank you for checking
in with me, you know?

31:49.866 --> 31:51.215
It means a lot,

31:51.240 --> 31:54.079
and I really needed this...
to talk and word vomit.

31:54.104 --> 31:55.168
I could tell.

31:55.193 --> 31:57.650
Your text the other day
had that S.O.S. quality.

31:57.674 --> 31:58.800
Oh, really? Why?

31:58.825 --> 32:01.087
Because I asked for
advice about nursing homes?

32:01.111 --> 32:04.078
I know the code for Abby's spinning.

32:04.114 --> 32:07.682
But you calling your business
partner by your ex's name,

32:07.717 --> 32:09.128
that's some DEFCON
1-level shit right there.

32:09.152 --> 32:10.685
Yeah, I know. Seriously.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.820
It's just like, "Ugh, poor Barbara."

32:12.856 --> 32:14.689
- How'd she react?
- I have no idea.

32:14.724 --> 32:18.126
I ran out of there before she
could react, and I'm pretty

32:18.161 --> 32:20.005
clear I can never go back
to that office again, so...

32:20.029 --> 32:21.596
- Yes, you can. Come on.
- Oh really?

32:21.631 --> 32:23.564
Have you ever called
a coworker "Collette"?

32:23.600 --> 32:26.000
Not yet. Any day now, though.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.691
I thought you were out
of it... The divorce fog.

32:32.842 --> 32:34.742
Yeah. Well, whatever.

32:34.778 --> 32:39.503
You know, battle wounds
never really go away.

32:45.867 --> 32:48.701
Maybe Barbara was right about me.

32:49.025 --> 32:52.360
- She was just frustrated.
- Well, Jake...

32:52.395 --> 32:54.662
Hey, now. Don't call me that too.

32:54.697 --> 32:56.831
This is Mike.

32:56.866 --> 32:58.588
I'm talking about the actual Jake.

32:58.613 --> 33:00.168
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- Jake the person.

33:00.203 --> 33:02.081
You know, his whole career
took off after we split,

33:02.105 --> 33:04.038
and I put that on him...
you know, and his issues

33:04.073 --> 33:06.652
with woman and power
and his manliness, and...

33:07.877 --> 33:10.778
Or that his whole financial safety net

33:10.814 --> 33:12.660
was gone so that, you know,

33:12.685 --> 33:15.920
maybe that lit a fire
under his butt, but...

33:18.103 --> 33:20.355
but maybe I am the problem.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.871
I push people down.

33:23.092 --> 33:25.827
I criticize them until they
don't want to try anymore, and...

33:25.862 --> 33:27.660
Stop. It takes two to end a marriage.

33:29.481 --> 33:31.715
Unless you're married to me, apparently.

33:32.435 --> 33:34.669
I do that. You know, I
just need to steer the ship,

33:34.704 --> 33:36.771
and that's probably
just therapy talk B.S.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.284
- Abby.
- But maybe it's real, you know?

33:38.308 --> 33:39.660
My patterns.

33:40.885 --> 33:42.588
I ruin things.

33:43.780 --> 33:49.050
I ruined my marriage, and
I can't take care of my dad.

33:49.085 --> 33:51.385
Failed at that.

33:51.421 --> 33:53.354
- Sorry.
- Look at me.

33:53.389 --> 33:54.956
You're doing your best.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.722
And now I'm ruining my business.

33:58.328 --> 34:01.027
'Cause that's who I
am. I let people down.

34:02.737 --> 34:05.871
I fail. I ruin.

34:06.236 --> 34:08.202
I'm... I'm a ruiner.

34:08.237 --> 34:12.837
Okay. That's not a real word.
You failed at English too?

34:13.362 --> 34:15.929
Hey. Hey.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.387
I don't see it that way.
They sell PB&J sandwiches.

34:26.413 --> 34:27.467
You sell...

34:27.492 --> 34:29.702
It's all about food, Glenn. It's treats.

34:29.726 --> 34:31.158
You're breakfast, they're lunch.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.927
What kind of entrepreneur are you?

34:32.962 --> 34:34.373
You're stealing from Peter to pay Paul.

34:34.397 --> 34:36.330
- His name is Jay.
- It's a metaphor!

34:36.366 --> 34:40.069
Hey, relax. I own the building.

34:40.270 --> 34:43.103
I can lease them to
who... Whatever I want.

34:43.139 --> 34:44.576
What if I own them?

34:45.408 --> 34:46.475
You?

34:46.755 --> 34:48.690
Yeah. Why not me?

34:48.715 --> 34:51.616
- You're kidding.
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

34:51.880 --> 34:55.049
Well, they're not for sale.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.108
This is America. Everything's for sale.

34:59.022 --> 35:00.795
Come on, G-man. Name your price.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.191
- Well, this was fun.
- I bet.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.779
Okay. Maybe a little weird.
You're my divorce role model.

35:07.804 --> 35:10.077
- Oh, yeah.
- Light in the dark and all that.

35:10.102 --> 35:11.877
Well, maybe that doesn't really exist.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.035
We're all just in it,

35:14.070 --> 35:16.304
just trying to hold on to our sanity.

35:16.339 --> 35:18.773
Yeah. You mean perpetual crazy time?

35:18.808 --> 35:21.116
- Yeah.
- You might be onto something there.

35:28.217 --> 35:31.886
Ah!

35:35.124 --> 35:38.859
Thank you, Mike, for being here.

35:38.895 --> 35:40.494
It was very nice of you.

35:42.999 --> 35:44.265
Yeah.

36:13.454 --> 36:15.121
Bun-Bun, did you meet Bernie?

36:15.156 --> 36:16.922
Guy is hilarious.

36:16.958 --> 36:18.691
Is that the guy who sells encyclopedias?

36:18.726 --> 36:20.626
Yeah, door to door.

36:20.661 --> 36:22.128
I thought that was just something

36:22.163 --> 36:24.130
that happened in Raymond Carver stories.

36:24.165 --> 36:27.133
- Right?
- Oh, and Glenda?

36:27.168 --> 36:32.108
Whoo! She reminds me of a lady
your mom took to on the cruise.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.358
Oh, Glenda, she has this way of...

36:42.826 --> 36:46.552
Hmm?

36:46.587 --> 36:48.554
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

36:48.589 --> 36:50.506
It's just...

36:54.429 --> 36:55.728
It's a whole new place.

36:55.753 --> 36:56.920
Mm-hmm.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.889
Without your mom.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.097
It's a lot.

37:03.171 --> 37:05.571
Well, I'm just a phone call away.

37:05.606 --> 37:07.039
- Mm.
- And, you know, me and

37:07.074 --> 37:09.542
the kids, we will come
visit you all the time.

37:09.577 --> 37:11.777
- Mm.
- Until you are sick of it.

37:12.340 --> 37:13.823
Never. Yeah.

37:14.849 --> 37:16.549
But I think that this is, you know,

37:16.584 --> 37:20.901
this is really the right
thing for all of us.

37:25.281 --> 37:27.648
I'm just a little scared. That's all.

37:33.621 --> 37:37.814
Me too. Me too.

37:39.232 --> 37:41.637
_

37:44.979 --> 37:46.465
Who's that from?

37:48.716 --> 37:50.098
Abby.

37:50.123 --> 37:52.223
Peace offering, I think.

37:52.248 --> 37:53.814
Beer?

37:54.288 --> 37:56.555
What she gave her ex when they'd feud.

37:56.591 --> 37:58.624
I think she told me that once.

37:58.659 --> 38:00.726
Did we have lunch
plans? I didn't realize.

38:00.761 --> 38:02.561
No. No, we didn't have plans.

38:02.597 --> 38:04.163
You know, it's hard to have plans

38:04.198 --> 38:05.534
when you don't return
my texts for three days.

38:05.559 --> 38:08.100
- Darrell...
- Barbara, what's going on here?

38:08.135 --> 38:09.668
You've been shrugging me off

38:09.704 --> 38:11.203
ever since that night at Phoebe's,

38:11.239 --> 38:12.714
and I want to know why. I deserve that.

38:12.739 --> 38:14.952
Can we not do this right
now, please? This is my work.

38:14.976 --> 38:17.348
Look, I know I was having
a bad night that night.

38:17.373 --> 38:18.878
I wasn't myself. I was...

38:18.913 --> 38:21.528
Grieving. I know that.

38:22.049 --> 38:24.750
Grieving your wife who
you loved very much.

38:24.785 --> 38:26.919
I know that, and I am so sorry for that.

38:26.954 --> 38:28.087
I really am.

38:28.122 --> 38:30.567
But it's hard for me to see,

38:32.193 --> 38:33.572
because...

38:35.029 --> 38:36.408
I love you.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.439
I'm in love with you.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.791
So there. There you go.

38:43.051 --> 38:45.418
And it freaks me out,

38:45.443 --> 38:48.994
because I know I'll
always be chasing her.

38:49.980 --> 38:51.613
I won't be able to fill that void.

38:51.638 --> 38:53.076
I just won't.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.263
I'll never be enough.

38:57.712 --> 39:00.865
Oh, no, no.

39:02.223 --> 39:03.896
You'll always be enough.

39:04.453 --> 39:06.753
You are more than enough.

39:15.612 --> 39:18.613
I can't believe I did this.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.207
Well, you definitely
went for it. It's bold.

39:22.243 --> 39:26.045
Bold. Yeah. I must have
been out of my gourd.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.613
Well, you haven't signed anything.

39:27.648 --> 39:29.114
You can still get out of it.

39:29.150 --> 39:30.992
No. I shook the bastard's hand.

39:31.385 --> 39:32.835
I'm not getting out of anything.

39:33.988 --> 39:35.687
My kid's gonna kill me.

39:36.778 --> 39:38.429
I can't afford this.

39:39.508 --> 39:41.070
My offer still stands.

39:43.698 --> 39:45.898
No strings.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.828
Delia, wait.

40:01.749 --> 40:03.716
Look. If it's positive...

40:03.751 --> 40:05.963
I already know what you want.
There's no hypothetical anymore.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.617
What do you want?

40:08.869 --> 40:11.071
I would make a terrible mother.

40:13.186 --> 40:14.819
I don't think that's true.

40:15.363 --> 40:19.231
Trust me. It's not in my DNA.

40:19.266 --> 40:22.199
It is not something
that I am capable of.

40:34.281 --> 40:35.620
I miss Keiko.

40:37.118 --> 40:38.450
Aw, I miss her too,

40:38.486 --> 40:39.896
but, you know, we
have a whole new friend

40:39.920 --> 40:41.292
coming to stay in the guesthouse.

40:41.922 --> 40:44.651
And there he is, right on time.

40:44.676 --> 40:45.979
I love that.

40:53.830 --> 40:56.664
I'm here about the
listing? The guesthouse?

41:00.095 --> 41:01.984
When did you get out?

41:03.944 --> 41:06.912
A few weeks ago. Early.

41:06.947 --> 41:11.050
Prison overcrowding. You believe that?

41:11.085 --> 41:14.853
Wow. I mean, this place.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.222
Nice. It's really nice.

41:17.258 --> 41:18.637
The listing doesn't do it justice.

41:20.494 --> 41:23.796
So... is that my nephew?

41:23.831 --> 41:25.629
Tony, I need you to get out.

41:55.031 --> 41:57.255
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.655
It was hard but good.

42:01.469 --> 42:05.116
So, looks like this is happening.

42:06.340 --> 42:07.444
Yeah.

42:09.090 --> 42:11.057
How do you feel about it?

42:16.196 --> 42:18.210
Terrified.
