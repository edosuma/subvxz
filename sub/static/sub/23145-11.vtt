WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.136
Remind me if I ever get married again

00:04.138 --> 00:05.604
to actually buy the photos

00:05.606 --> 00:07.740
instead of just keeping
the photographer's samples.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.344
God. What are they up to now?

00:12.346 --> 00:13.345
Stan and Jeff?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.680
Not 100% sure, but I think

00:15.682 --> 00:17.816
they're planning a surprise for me.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.284
Because whenever I come around,

00:19.286 --> 00:21.085
they stop talking and leave the room.

00:21.087 --> 00:23.087
Babe! We're going on a bear hunt!

00:23.089 --> 00:25.758
Oh, God. It's one of the
ones where they're friends.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.559
Jeff and I are playing "Davy Crockett,"

00:27.561 --> 00:30.362
and murdering bears is
a central part of that.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.964
That and the fashion, obviously.

00:31.966 --> 00:33.899
I'm Davy, he's Crockett.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.035
How 'bout that, Hayley?

00:37.037 --> 00:40.839
Two city gals like us,
married to real frontiersmen.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.440
What are you talking about?

00:42.442 --> 00:43.842
Those two have been insufferable

00:43.844 --> 00:46.311
ever since they watched that
"Mr. Rogers" episode

00:46.313 --> 00:47.846
about "imagination."

00:47.848 --> 00:49.113
Mm-mm.

00:49.115 --> 00:52.717
You know that Fred Rogers can get down.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.120
He could take his shoes
off and keep going.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.255
Geez, Mom.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.859
Fine! Who's at the top
of <i> your</i> PBS bang list?

01:00.861 --> 01:03.261
I bet you're a "Sesame Street" girl.

01:03.263 --> 01:06.198
Cookie Monster... so obvious.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.468
That guy in the trash can...
he's pretty hot.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.935
Oh, I know.

01:10.937 --> 01:14.339
You want Bert and Ernie... two for one.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.274
That's good value, Hayley.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.810
Geez, Mom.

01:17.812 --> 01:18.877
Relax.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.879
Someday, you'll be having
the same conversation

01:20.881 --> 01:22.414

01:54.981 --> 01:57.582
You'd probably want
to get with The Count.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.317
You love guys with accents.

01:59.319 --> 02:02.721
You get all shy whenever we
go into that cellphone store.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.991
Did you get sprayed by a skunk?

02:06.993 --> 02:08.727
Yeah, but I got to tickle it

02:08.729 --> 02:10.863
for five whole seconds first.

02:10.865 --> 02:13.098
Well, at least you told the truth.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.166
Which means...

02:15.269 --> 02:16.601
I owe you a Matchbox car.

02:16.603 --> 02:17.802
I like Hot Wheels!

02:17.804 --> 02:19.805
How many times do I have to tell you?!

02:21.682 --> 02:24.076
- I'm losing my mind.
- Well, husbands are a lot of work.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.810
It doesn't seem to affect <i> you.</i>

02:25.812 --> 02:27.679
I mean, Dad is running around

02:27.681 --> 02:30.549
in a hat he made from
Steve's Rocket Raccoon toy.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.884
He did what?!

02:31.886 --> 02:34.553
You're right, Hayley.
I <i> don't</i> let it get to me.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.621
And if you want, I can let you in

02:36.623 --> 02:38.623
on a little secret that's helped me.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.092
Please do.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.761
I'm better at being
married than you are.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.497
- What?!
- I have lots of little secrets.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.966
Like this bullfrog I keep in my hair.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.636
His name is Clarke Michael Duncan.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.373
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold!

02:55.414 --> 02:56.775
Ooh, is someone bathing...

02:56.777 --> 02:58.843
Oh, it's Jeff. Gross.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.246
Welp, back to standing silently

03:01.248 --> 03:02.714
in the dark garage.

03:07.935 --> 03:10.322
Mom, can you help me
wash the skunk off Jeff?

03:10.324 --> 03:11.523
He's being really squirmy.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.458
Sorry, Hayley. I'm headed to Costco.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.727
Oh, great.

03:14.729 --> 03:16.661
Can you pick up those
big cans of tomato juice

03:16.663 --> 03:17.662
to get the skunk out?

03:17.664 --> 03:18.863
Ooh, sorry.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.399
This trip is just to pick up

03:20.401 --> 03:22.867
two flats of Dan Brown hardbacks.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.248
They burn so much cleaner than firewood.

03:25.283 --> 03:28.107
- But could you still...
- Uh... Eep, eep, eep!

03:34.041 --> 03:36.014
Another clean getaway!

03:36.611 --> 03:39.351
What would I do without my eeps?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.722
Why did she get on an airport shuttle?

03:45.359 --> 03:47.559
Jeff, you're in charge of
cleaning your own privates.

03:48.192 --> 03:50.562
That's too much responsibility!

03:53.500 --> 03:56.001

04:17.663 --> 04:19.291

through without a ticket?

04:19.293 --> 04:21.159
She's part of our
Airport Angels program.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.161
They assist people to
their gate who want help.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.963
And they do it all for nothing,

04:24.965 --> 04:27.299
except for the complimentary
Toblerone from Duty Free.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.834
They say shape doesn't
make a difference,

04:28.836 --> 04:30.502
but I think triangles taste better.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.672
Great, great. Where do I sign
up for this Airport Angel B.S.?

I'm just a sweet old lady.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.852
Ooh, there she is!

04:46.854 --> 04:48.320
Hey, you idiot!

04:48.322 --> 04:51.790
I'm supposed to be going to China,
not Albuquerque!

04:52.792 --> 04:53.826
Oh!

04:55.262 --> 04:57.663
Oh, it all worked out!

04:57.665 --> 04:59.397
I get to ride with my bags

04:59.399 --> 05:03.001

my hair gels and salsas!

you were better at

Come on, Hayley. Give me this one thing.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.241
You're so much better
at everything else.

06:49.243 --> 06:52.044
- Like what?!
- Like the stuff that matters.

06:52.046 --> 06:54.980
You have the Galaga
high score at the deli.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.649
Don't you think that
burns me up at night?!

06:57.651 --> 06:59.251
That's Hayley Schmitterhaus!

06:59.253 --> 07:01.987
She was abducted eight years
ago selling Girl Scout cookies.

Oh. Well, that makes me

07:05.192 --> 07:06.324
Wait.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.392
Are you the Hayley

07:07.394 --> 07:09.261
on the "Frogger" at the laundromat?

07:09.263 --> 07:10.328
Yeah, that one's me.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.598
10th place. Terrible score!

07:12.600 --> 07:14.199
Let me give you some advice.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.869
In "Frogger,"
some of those logs are alligators.

07:17.871 --> 07:18.970
Chomp, chomp.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.741
Oh. Jeff sat on his balls.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.943
And he doesn't know what to do.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.606
"Stand... up."

07:27.615 --> 07:29.414
Pull up a stool, girl.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.950
Jeff's floppy balls will
be there when you get home.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.952
How do <i> you</i> know Jeff's balls are floppy?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.254
I can hear 'em.

07:40.082 --> 07:41.126
We probably don't need to bring

07:41.128 --> 07:43.462
three different flavors of Triscuits,
do we?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.997
You never know which flavor's
gonna give you the edge

07:45.999 --> 07:49.000
when you tango with the big brown man.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.270
- Is that what you call bears?
- Correct.

07:51.272 --> 07:53.272
Jeff, where did all my underwear go?

07:53.274 --> 07:54.606
Jeff, I'll get more supplies

07:54.608 --> 07:56.675
while you negotiate
with this fur trapper.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.945
I'm pretending Hayley's
a French-Canadian fur trapper.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.880
Time to negotiate.

08:01.882 --> 08:05.083
I'll give you $50.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.752
God, I hate this.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.886
Come on!

08:07.888 --> 08:09.088
I dressed Steve up as a bear

08:09.090 --> 08:11.957
and told him we were
playing hide-and-seek.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.625
That looked like a real arrow.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.160
A-Are they gonna hunt Steve?

08:15.162 --> 08:18.897
Yes. And you know Steve's
just loving all the attention.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.000
Shuttle's here!

08:23.904 --> 08:25.236
What is it, hon?

08:25.238 --> 08:27.706
Don't get me wrong. I-I love booze.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.108
But all I can think about

08:29.110 --> 08:31.176
is how Jeff stretched
out all my underwear,

08:31.178 --> 08:32.910
making them into slingshots.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.712
I think it was your ass that did that.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.914
- Mom!
- Lighten up, fat-ass!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.984
That's how we razz at O'rrivals!

08:38.986 --> 08:41.186
Is there a place I
can plug in my laptop?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.455
See? <i> He</i> gets it.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.524
Hayley, this is our escape.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.925
You need to unwind!

08:46.927 --> 08:48.393
That's what I'm trying to do!

08:48.395 --> 08:51.262
Well, I guess we need to step it up.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.464
Ow! Why would you do that?!

08:53.466 --> 08:55.266
Because when drinking doesn't work,

08:55.268 --> 08:56.668
there's nothing like a bar fight

08:56.670 --> 08:59.138
to make the rest of the world fade away.

08:59.140 --> 09:00.539
Oh, okay. Let's rumble.

09:02.343 --> 09:04.143
Let the bitch out of the box, Hayles!

09:04.145 --> 09:06.211
I don't see how this is gonna help.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.079
Do it. You'll feel better.

09:08.776 --> 09:09.781
Nice one!

09:10.417 --> 09:12.551
That feels amazing! Who's next?

09:12.553 --> 09:15.020
I-I'm just trying to get to Wisconsin

09:15.022 --> 09:16.155
to bury my mother!

09:16.157 --> 09:18.023
Not on <i> my</i> watch.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.027
This is great, Mom!

09:22.029 --> 09:23.829
Hey, we're gonna need two more beers.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.031
You got it, but happy hour's over.

09:26.476 --> 09:27.699
Happy hour's over.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.834
That's our cue to go.

09:28.836 --> 09:29.901
What? Why?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.903
I-I was just starting to unwind.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.438
Yeah, and that's all you need.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.907
I mean, don't you feel you could go home

09:35.909 --> 09:37.509
and deal with Jeff now?

09:37.511 --> 09:39.310
You know what? I do.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.994
He accidentally saw Tuttle's
penis the other day,

09:42.029 --> 09:43.182
and I feel like I'm finally ready

09:43.184 --> 09:45.116
to have a frank talk with him about it.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.451
It's really...

09:46.453 --> 09:49.054
I-I can see he's
thinking about it a lot.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.522
Attagirl!

09:50.524 --> 09:52.991
And don't worry.
We'll be back here tomorrow.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.926
Okay.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.928
What airline you flying, chump?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.329
Frontier.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.899
Good. They'll finish the job.

10:10.544 --> 10:13.278
<i>Hey, babe,
I owe you one tube of toothpaste.</i>

10:13.280 --> 10:15.480
<i>Needed it to seal our canoe.</i>

10:15.482 --> 10:16.948
Damn it, Jeff.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.083
Well, joke's on him.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.219
I don't use toothpaste.

10:22.223 --> 10:24.756
<i>Oh, hey, babe. I owe you one toothbrush.</i>

10:24.758 --> 10:27.358
<i>Needed it for brushing
my teeth in the canoe.</i>

10:27.360 --> 10:30.295
Ugh! This canoe is hounding me!

10:30.297 --> 10:32.497
But at least I still
have my trusty tampons.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.499
I'll just brush my
teeth with one of those.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.768
Little trick I read in <i> Vogue.</i>

10:36.770 --> 10:37.836
Right, ladies?

10:40.574 --> 10:41.573
<i>Me again, babe.</i>

10:41.575 --> 10:43.775
<i>I owe you a hundred tampoons.</i>

10:43.777 --> 10:46.045
<i>I used a bottle of nail
polish to paint them red</i>

10:46.047 --> 10:47.579
<i>'cause I needed dynamite.</i>

10:49.050 --> 10:50.315
<i>...to blow up my canoe.</i>

10:50.317 --> 10:51.716
- Daaahh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:51.718 --> 10:53.985
You're not gonna destroy
that box, are you?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.386
Relax. I could sit on that

10:55.388 --> 10:57.188
while I'm waiting for
something to happen.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.525
Damn! Your breath is kickin', girl.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.227
Ever heard of tampons?

11:05.532 --> 11:07.466
Water.

11:08.402 --> 11:10.969
Look! Rogu found water!

11:13.206 --> 11:14.205
On your toes, men.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.941
We're deep in bear country.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.010
- That sounds like a real bear!
- Run!

11:22.950 --> 11:24.950
Just crushed 38 O'Doul's.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.018
That's equal to two Coors Lights.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.620
That's like one Corona.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.089
I'm feelin' it!

11:30.091 --> 11:32.824
Aww. Is that a little coonskin cap?

11:32.826 --> 11:34.559
Rat skin.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.228
You're sending my
ovaries into hyperdrive.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.697
How'd you like a little sister?

11:38.699 --> 11:41.366
Rogu eat sister.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.203
O-Only you, Rogu.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.771
Francine! There's a bear outside!

11:46.773 --> 11:49.174
It sounded big and mean
and wanted to eat us!

11:49.176 --> 11:51.189
Ooh, sounds scary!

11:51.224 --> 11:52.688
Wanna hide under the covers?

11:52.723 --> 11:54.245
Uh-huh.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.781
Can you put up the force field?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.316
Force field up.

11:57.318 --> 11:58.517
Make the sound.

11:58.519 --> 12:00.986
Zzh-zzh-zzh-zzh-zzh-
Zzh-zzh-zzh-zzh-zzh.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.256
What about me, Mrs. S?

12:05.258 --> 12:06.858
Go to <i> your</i> room and have Hayley

12:06.860 --> 12:08.459
put up a force field for you.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.796
She's not here. She went to Costco.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.263
Eep.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.466
Now, open up that force field,

12:14.468 --> 12:16.868
or we're all gonna get blown to bits!

12:21.809 --> 12:25.144
Guys! I made a big dent in my
paperwork and earned a break!

12:25.146 --> 12:26.812
Can I play Davy Crockett with you?

12:26.814 --> 12:29.148
Klaus loser.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.551
Rogu's in there with you guys?!

12:32.553 --> 12:34.686
Everything sucks since he got here!

12:34.688 --> 12:37.622
He's supposed to be helping
with Roger's personas!

12:37.624 --> 12:39.024
Roger!

12:39.026 --> 12:41.827
Rogu isn't doing his job!

12:46.433 --> 12:47.632
I did it.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.569
I finished the "Drinks of Dublin Tour."

12:50.571 --> 12:53.305
Now take my picture
and put it on the wall!

12:55.376 --> 12:57.509
Wait, wait, wait. Which is better?

12:57.511 --> 12:58.910
Like this...

12:58.912 --> 12:59.978
or like this?

13:05.919 --> 13:07.386
Just lovely.

13:07.388 --> 13:08.387
Hayley.

13:08.389 --> 13:10.189
I know this is a nice escape,

13:10.191 --> 13:12.257
but you can't spend all your time

13:12.259 --> 13:15.194
with a bunch of losers
at a fake Irish bar.

13:15.196 --> 13:16.395
No offense, Jason.

13:16.397 --> 13:17.396
None taken.

13:17.398 --> 13:18.663
This is just part-time

13:18.665 --> 13:20.599
while I plan my terrorist stuff.

13:20.601 --> 13:23.334
I told you, being here for happy hour

13:23.336 --> 13:25.470
is all the escape a wife should need.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.473
I get it, Mom! You're the perfect wife!

13:28.475 --> 13:30.876
You know exactly how many hours a day

13:30.878 --> 13:33.478
to avoid your husband
at the airport bar.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.280
You're June [BLEEP] Cleaver!

13:35.282 --> 13:37.549
Oh! References, huh?

13:37.551 --> 13:39.551
All right, Pauly Shore,

13:39.553 --> 13:42.888
let's get you back to "Shutter Island."

13:42.890 --> 13:43.889
Boo!

13:43.891 --> 13:45.490
Pbbbbbbht!

13:45.492 --> 13:47.559
That's your best comeback?

13:47.561 --> 13:48.627
Millennials!

13:48.629 --> 13:49.628
Right, Jason?

13:49.630 --> 13:52.631
Right! Blow 'em sky high, I say!

13:52.633 --> 13:54.600
- What?
- Good night!

13:59.372 --> 14:00.706
Wake up, sleepyhead.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.974
I'm sure you're feeling a little ragged,

14:02.976 --> 14:04.976
but it's almost noon.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.113
You got Rogu'd.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.481
Every damn time!

14:10.251 --> 14:11.250
What is this?

14:11.252 --> 14:13.704
Real life.

14:13.739 --> 14:16.255
<i>Dear Mom,
I thought about what you said.</i>

14:16.257 --> 14:19.591
<i>You're right. Happy hour
should be enough for a wife.</i>

14:19.593 --> 14:21.860
Oh, wow. I got through to her.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.545
Keep reading.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.397
<i>But it's</i> not <i> enough for me.</i>

14:26.399 --> 14:28.800
<i>You</i> are <i> better at being
married than I am.</i>

14:28.802 --> 14:30.802
<i>I shouldn't even</i> be <i> married.</i>

14:30.804 --> 14:33.509
<i>So, I'm escaping
to where no one can find me.</i>

14:33.544 --> 14:36.541
<i>The original O'rrivals
in Ireland, Europe.</i>

14:36.543 --> 14:38.277
- Ohh!
- <i>P.S.</i>

14:38.279 --> 14:41.546
<i>Rogu is allowed to eat as
much raw pasta as he wants.</i>

14:41.548 --> 14:44.283
Rogu, I know you wrote that last part.

14:44.285 --> 14:46.084
Bwaaah-ha!

14:47.006 --> 14:48.887
Flying to Ireland.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.089
<i>That's</i> what I should've done!

14:51.091 --> 14:53.292
I was in an airport all week.

14:53.294 --> 14:55.694
I, too, should be flying to Ireland.

14:55.696 --> 14:58.563
I'm a pilot. I like handles, not wheels.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.565
I like radar, not sonar.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.169
I wanna be up with the stars,
not down with the starfish!

15:04.171 --> 15:05.504
I should be sailing!

15:05.506 --> 15:09.440
I like fishing nets,
not Gogo Inflight Internet!

15:09.442 --> 15:11.577
But we both like galleys.

15:16.383 --> 15:19.251
Wow. My adventure begins.

15:19.253 --> 15:20.919
None of my troubles can find me here.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.521
Not Jeff, not Mom,

15:22.523 --> 15:25.990
not even that infernal Rogu,
the King of Pranks.

15:25.992 --> 15:28.460
Oh, I can't wait to get
to the original O'rrivals

15:28.462 --> 15:30.696
and party my tits off!

15:31.702 --> 15:33.465
'Sup, party people?!

15:33.467 --> 15:35.267
My lucky charms!

15:35.269 --> 15:37.001
Freckle freaks!

15:37.003 --> 15:38.737
My Irish ragers!

15:39.353 --> 15:41.139
I hope it's happy hour!

15:41.141 --> 15:42.474
What?

15:42.476 --> 15:44.295
You know... happy hour.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.211
Where the drinks are cheap
and the apps are half off.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.279
Ah.

15:47.281 --> 15:49.882
Around here, we call it "sad hour."

15:49.884 --> 15:52.817
'Cause that's when we take
a two-hour break to be sad

15:52.819 --> 15:55.487
instead of bone-crushingly depressed.

15:55.489 --> 15:56.689
Kewl-kewl!

15:56.691 --> 15:58.623
Beer and a slippery nip, please.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.425
I'm gonna get the lay of the land

16:00.427 --> 16:02.594
from the local folks.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.497
Why the frown, James Brown?

16:05.499 --> 16:08.032
The bank took my family farm.

16:08.034 --> 16:11.236
I hear ya. My husband's
been wearing a stupid hat.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.571
To us!

16:12.573 --> 16:14.306
Why so sad, Sinbad?

16:14.308 --> 16:15.507
Me wife left me.

16:15.509 --> 16:16.909
That's nothing.

16:16.911 --> 16:19.444
My husband's obsessed with his canoe.

16:20.781 --> 16:23.315
Why the sorrow, Benicio del Toro?

16:23.317 --> 16:25.117
Cat got your tongue, Connie Chung?

16:25.119 --> 16:26.651
<i>Cancer</i> took her tongue.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.120
I wanted a slippery nipple.

16:28.122 --> 16:31.656
And <i> I</i> wanted a face shape
that's good for sunglasses,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.792
but life is cruel.

16:33.794 --> 16:34.793
Jukebox!

16:34.795 --> 16:36.394
Let's kick this up a notch.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.996
It only plays this song.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.065
That and Ireland's national anthem...

16:40.067 --> 16:41.400
"Steal My Sunshine."

16:41.402 --> 16:42.801
O... kay.

16:42.803 --> 16:44.336
You guys are bummers!

16:45.128 --> 16:46.540
I know what you need.

16:46.575 --> 16:48.607
A little secret my mom taught me.

16:48.609 --> 16:49.708
Lady shove!

16:54.681 --> 16:55.780
We're doing it!

17:01.355 --> 17:02.887
Hey, Mrs. S,

17:02.889 --> 17:05.490
I know you said Hayley
went out to get me a toy,

17:05.492 --> 17:06.891
but I'm getting worried.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.426
It's been seven mailmans.

17:08.429 --> 17:11.396
Jeff, have a snack and stop worrying.

17:12.967 --> 17:14.031
Mmm.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.300
Thanks, Mrs. S.

17:15.301 --> 17:17.301
This is <i> way</i> better than worrying.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.435
Wait a second.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.638
Did you... actually stop worrying?

17:20.641 --> 17:22.174
Yeah. You told me to.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.241
Huh.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.310
Jeff, sit down.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.911
Stand up.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.104
Be happy.

17:28.449 --> 17:29.656
Be sad.

17:29.984 --> 17:31.249
Be Larry King.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.717
Boston, you're on the air.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.052
Stan! Come here!

17:34.054 --> 17:35.454
You can't tell me what to do!

17:35.456 --> 17:38.523
Exactly. He <i> never</i> does what I say.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.058
But <i> you</i> do!

17:40.060 --> 17:42.460
Pack your bags.
We're going to get Hayley.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.662
Gotcha, Mrs. S!

17:43.664 --> 17:45.730
Wait. Pack <i> my</i> bags, too.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.540
Will do. How many staplers
do you want to bring?

17:48.575 --> 17:50.869
Never mind. I'll pack for both of us.

17:50.871 --> 17:52.871
Like with all my Barry Manilow albums,

17:52.873 --> 17:55.441
there's really gonna
be room for staplers.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.077
More deserters.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.079
We're the last two men at the Alamo.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.682
Rogu love dessert.

18:03.684 --> 18:06.618
Remember the a la mode. [ALAMO]

18:06.620 --> 18:08.620
Rogu, everything's a joke to you,

18:08.622 --> 18:10.288
and I don't mind that.

18:12.693 --> 18:16.161
Why so weepy, Meryl Streepy?

18:16.163 --> 18:18.163
Well, the fight was fun, and it was cool

18:18.165 --> 18:20.432
when that nun started
swinging that chain around,

18:20.434 --> 18:22.167
but now I just feel empty.

18:22.169 --> 18:25.704
I miss Jeff,
even if he <i> can</i> be a pain in the ass.

18:25.706 --> 18:26.971
I'm going home.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.841
You're not going anywhere.

18:28.843 --> 18:30.509
You broke my jukebox.

18:30.511 --> 18:32.377
You have to work off what you owe me...

18:32.379 --> 18:35.380
4,500 Irish Money Units.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.249
Well, that's a bummer.

18:37.251 --> 18:38.517
...Christopher Plummer.

18:38.519 --> 18:39.984
Babe!

18:39.986 --> 18:40.985
Jeff!

18:40.987 --> 18:42.587
What are you guys doing here?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.389
I came to say I'm sorry.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.590
For what?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.192
For giving you bad advice.

18:47.194 --> 18:50.529
I told you the only way to
be happy in your marriage

18:50.531 --> 18:51.930
was to have an escape.

18:51.932 --> 18:53.665
But that's <i> my</i> marriage.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.935
When your dad annoys me,
I can't stop him.

18:56.937 --> 18:58.670
That's why I have to get away.

18:58.672 --> 19:01.406
But Jeff... if <i> he</i> starts to annoy you,

19:01.408 --> 19:02.741
just tell him what you want.

19:02.743 --> 19:04.209
It's not that simple, Mrs. S.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.879
- Corner.
- Love to be where those two walls meet!

19:06.881 --> 19:09.548
See? You're gonna be happy
when you come home

19:09.550 --> 19:11.750
if you just tell Jeff what to do.

19:11.752 --> 19:12.951
Now let's go.

19:12.953 --> 19:14.152
She can't go anywhere.

19:14.154 --> 19:17.622
Not until I get my 4,500 McBucks.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.624
This dude's hella dead.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.959
Hold my Fitbit.

19:20.961 --> 19:24.199
Actually, no.
I want credit for this ass-kicking.

19:24.234 --> 19:26.231
Are you guys seeing this corner?

19:26.233 --> 19:27.432
Wait a second, Mom.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.967
Maybe there's another way.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.326
Hi. I'm Jeff. I work here
because my wife asked me to.

19:32.361 --> 19:33.572
I'm not allowed to bring up leprechauns.

19:33.574 --> 19:35.107
Can I take your order?

19:35.109 --> 19:37.242
That was good,
but you still mentioned the leprechauns.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.844
I saw one in the urinal! It bit me!

19:39.846 --> 19:40.979
I think you're right.

19:40.981 --> 19:43.115
Jeff will do fine working off your debt.

19:43.117 --> 19:45.384
And all you had to do was tell him to.

19:45.386 --> 19:47.319
Thanks for taking my place.

19:47.321 --> 19:49.521
I love you. Remember that.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.456
And that's a Goddamn order.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.857
I love you, too.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.627
Because I may be a moron...

19:58.198 --> 19:59.531
Yes?

19:59.533 --> 20:00.733
Yes.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.540
Mom, you're back!

20:08.542 --> 20:10.342
Enemy reinforcements, Rogu.

20:10.344 --> 20:12.210
The Alamo must not fall!

20:12.947 --> 20:17.750
Rogu going to Hell,
but he not going alone.

20:19.553 --> 20:21.486
One more drink at O'rrivals?

20:21.488 --> 20:22.687
Why stop at one?

20:25.626 --> 20:28.360
Why do you keep leaving?!

20:28.362 --> 20:30.229
Have a great night.

20:32.182 --> 20:34.248
