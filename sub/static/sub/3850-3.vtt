00:00.340 --> 00:01.913
How do you all feel

00:01.947 --> 00:04.313
about Marc and Scotty living here with us?

00:04.346 --> 00:05.162
Awesome!

00:05.190 --> 00:07.035
<i>Previously on Mistresses... </i>

00:07.052 --> 00:09.038
I'd appreciate if you adjusted your tone.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.774
I'll kiss your ass all day long if you
decide my wife is worthy of being saved.

00:12.894 --> 00:14.149
Why would you do this for me?

00:14.185 --> 00:16.114
I want to be of use. I want

00:16.234 --> 00:17.432
to believe in something.

00:17.466 --> 00:20.963
I love you. And I know that I'm
gonna be with you. But now right now.

00:21.016 --> 00:23.566
This Harry must be
something pretty special.

00:23.594 --> 00:24.561
He is.

00:24.821 --> 00:26.350
Are you Harry Davis?

00:26.401 --> 00:27.991
I've heard a lot about you.

Lucy, we're leaving in
five minutes! Get a move on!

02:14.762 --> 02:16.062
Oh.

02:16.182 --> 02:17.813
Scotty.

02:17.933 --> 02:19.608
Scotty.

02:21.120 --> 02:24.348
Just to be clear, Marc,
I am not your alarm clock.

02:24.365 --> 02:27.096
I've had to wake you
up the last three days.

02:27.216 --> 02:28.532
It's your responsibility

02:28.543 --> 02:30.599
to get Scotty off to
school on time, not mine.

02:30.621 --> 02:31.872
I'm not much of a morning person.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.926
I didn't process a lot
of what you just said.

02:33.977 --> 02:35.677
Uh, I think now would be a good time

02:35.698 --> 02:37.484
for us to talk about a game plan.

02:37.752 --> 02:39.921
Miranda's gone for the
next... what?... Three months.

02:40.041 --> 02:41.605
- [Teakettle whistling]
- Maybe now would be a good time

02:41.616 --> 02:43.069
for you to look for some kind of job.

02:43.888 --> 02:45.101
Something to get you out of the house,

02:45.126 --> 02:46.883
give your day a little structure?

02:46.916 --> 02:48.002
[Water pours]

02:48.592 --> 02:49.679
- Structure.
- Right.

02:49.697 --> 02:51.701
It doesn't even have to be full time.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.700
Just something to frame the day.

02:55.699 --> 02:57.839
Gotcha. I'll... I'll get right on that.

03:02.382 --> 03:03.418
[Sighs]

03:03.480 --> 03:05.813
Alec: Procedure will take
anywhere from four to six hours.

03:05.856 --> 03:07.309
The blood will be taken from your right arm

03:07.330 --> 03:09.169
and go through a centrifugal system here,

03:09.564 --> 03:11.110
which basically means the stem cells

03:11.117 --> 03:12.309
will be separated from your blood.

03:12.331 --> 03:14.338
I've already read up
on the procedure, Alec,

03:14.345 --> 03:15.678
so you don't have to go through it.

03:15.704 --> 03:18.558
Blood will then re-enter your
left arm, minus your stem cells.

03:18.587 --> 03:21.022
You'll probably experience
fatigue as the day wears on

03:21.047 --> 03:22.890
and quite possibly pain
during the procedure,

03:22.906 --> 03:23.897
but we can only give you Tylenol.

03:23.916 --> 03:25.813
- We can't contaminate the...
- Why do you do that?

03:25.861 --> 03:27.697
- Do what?
- That "talking down to the patient" thing

03:27.722 --> 03:28.660
that you're doing.

03:28.867 --> 03:30.930
You do remember I'm a doctor, right?

03:31.050 --> 03:32.509
Eh, a psychiatrist isn't exactly

03:32.527 --> 03:34.049
the same kind of doctor, now, is it?

03:35.585 --> 03:36.657
Nurse will take you from here.

03:37.135 --> 03:38.098
See you on the other side.

03:39.090 --> 03:39.869
Are you ready?

03:40.923 --> 03:43.201
Yeah, let me just grab
something to read first.

03:43.281 --> 03:45.302
Sorry. You have to keep
your arms out straight.

03:46.703 --> 03:47.679
But you can watch TV.

03:47.713 --> 03:49.729
We only get a few channels on this thing,

03:49.776 --> 03:51.281
but I think "Judge Judy" should be on.

03:51.401 --> 03:52.282
No, thanks.

03:56.138 --> 03:58.052
[Indistinct talking over P.A. in distance]

04:09.061 --> 04:11.025

04:30.744 --> 04:32.707
[Knocking on door]

04:32.758 --> 04:35.087
[Indistinct conversation]

04:35.207 --> 04:37.276
Joss: Oh! Hey, Wil!

04:37.303 --> 04:40.303
Is our, uh, little lady ready
to get her soul cycle on?

04:40.515 --> 04:41.831
[Door closes]

04:41.951 --> 04:44.194
It's Wil-son.

04:44.555 --> 04:47.399
You and I, we are not yet
on an abbreviating basis.

04:47.439 --> 04:48.925
No problemo, Wilsonian.

04:49.045 --> 04:49.934
See what I did there?

04:50.269 --> 04:51.615
- I made it longer.
- There is no way

04:51.633 --> 04:53.697
that Calista is spinning
with you today, okay?

04:53.715 --> 04:56.024
She is presenting her spring
line to Ken Downing tomorrow.

04:56.038 --> 04:58.234
Well, she texted me this morning
saying that we're on, so...

04:58.275 --> 05:00.177
Ken Downing.

05:00.417 --> 05:01.757
Director of Neiman Marcus?

05:01.877 --> 05:02.422
Wow?

05:02.477 --> 05:03.653
"Wow" is what you say

05:03.676 --> 05:04.939
when your parents let you ride a pony.

05:04.994 --> 05:07.072
Mr. Downing is only the
tastemaker of fashion.

05:07.092 --> 05:09.463
All right? Runway today, real way tomorrow.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.147
No, there is no excuse for that!

05:11.482 --> 05:12.732
That's my cue to leave.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.203
[Chortles]

05:14.384 --> 05:17.694
No, you don't have to tell
me it is the 11th hour.

05:17.771 --> 05:19.668
I'm well aware of that fact.

05:19.926 --> 05:21.266
You know what? You know what, Ed?

05:21.858 --> 05:22.910
It's an excuse.

05:22.964 --> 05:25.441
And it's one frigging excuse
after another frigging excuse.

05:25.461 --> 05:26.976
And you know what? I am tired of it.

05:26.972 --> 05:28.644
I am tired of it. You're fired.

05:28.666 --> 05:29.141
[Beep]

05:30.296 --> 05:32.081
We're supposed to go spinning!

05:32.107 --> 05:34.595
- Crap! I'm so sorry!
- No, no, no, don't worry about it.

05:34.627 --> 05:36.049
You're obviously having a morning.

05:36.071 --> 05:37.989
[Voice breaking] But, hey, if
it makes you feel any better,

05:38.109 --> 05:40.059
that dress is so beautiful I want to cry.

05:40.100 --> 05:40.847
Thank you,

05:40.883 --> 05:42.454
- but no one's ever gonna see it.
- [Sighs]

05:42.925 --> 05:44.577
- Ooh. Why not?
- [Sighs]

05:44.659 --> 05:46.864
My imbecile of an event planner,

05:46.915 --> 05:49.888
he never secured the venue,
so the "W" fell through,

05:49.915 --> 05:52.632
and we're out, and I am screwed.

05:52.678 --> 05:55.177
Uh, hello? I also plan events.

05:55.190 --> 05:56.223
Venues are my bread and butter.

05:56.241 --> 05:57.667
I... there's a million people that owe me.

05:57.676 --> 05:58.748
Let me just make a few phone calls.

05:58.751 --> 05:59.696
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.860
- You're hired.
- You don't have to pay me, Calista.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.019
I'm happy to do it as your friend.

06:03.021 --> 06:04.398
No, don't... don't you dare.

06:05.134 --> 06:07.509
- What? What did I...
- You never ever work for free.

06:07.552 --> 06:08.641
Your time is worth something,

06:08.664 --> 06:11.317
especially when you're launching
a new business, understood?

06:11.598 --> 06:13.015
Listen, if you take you seriously,

06:13.046 --> 06:14.645
then the rest of the world is going to.

06:15.347 --> 06:16.179
All righty, then.

06:16.202 --> 06:17.776
I will heed your sage advice.

06:17.791 --> 06:19.522
And... and I will start charging you...

06:19.565 --> 06:21.833
- [Cellphone chimes]
-... Right after I text Harry back.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.205
Harry?

06:23.788 --> 06:24.857
Since when are we talking to Harry?

06:24.871 --> 06:26.368
Since he called me the other night.

06:26.393 --> 06:28.388
We... we... I haven't seen
him. We're just texting

06:28.443 --> 06:29.598
and talking.

06:32.438 --> 06:34.618
What? You don't think that
I should be doing that?

06:34.636 --> 06:36.059
You know, what I think doesn't matter.

06:36.085 --> 06:38.374
Um, Eva, you're done. You could, um...

06:38.494 --> 06:40.583
Go give the dress to Wilson.
He's in the other room.

06:40.670 --> 06:43.408
Look, you're the one who
said you wanted some time

06:43.495 --> 06:44.751
before you committed to Harry.

06:44.773 --> 06:46.790
I'm just repeating what you told me.

06:47.116 --> 06:48.677
Well... [Sighs]

06:48.757 --> 06:51.361
I mean, that is what I said I wanted,

06:51.368 --> 06:53.512
but then, uh, we just
sort of fell back into it,

06:53.533 --> 06:56.185
you know, the way that we were,
because he's my best friend.

06:56.464 --> 06:58.489
I don't even remember why
we're not together right now.

06:58.609 --> 06:59.251
[Sighs]

06:59.371 --> 07:01.570
Well, because you felt guilty about Savi

07:01.596 --> 07:03.439
and you wanted this
relationship to be a choice

07:03.511 --> 07:06.254
rather than a reaction to a
wedding that you didn't want.

07:06.917 --> 07:07.699
You're right.

07:07.873 --> 07:08.677
I did say that.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.416
Which means no talking,

07:10.655 --> 07:14.037
no texting. If you want a
break, then take a real break.

07:14.068 --> 07:15.500
It's the only way to know for sure.

07:16.297 --> 07:17.413
You're right.

07:17.922 --> 07:18.684
Again.

07:18.731 --> 07:19.485
Okay, great.

07:19.492 --> 07:21.354
All right, now, please, let's talk venues.

07:21.401 --> 07:22.991
Oh, um, literally

07:23.023 --> 07:24.439
give me two seconds. Watch what happens.

07:30.343 --> 07:31.051
[Knock on door]

07:32.230 --> 07:33.042
[Sighs]

07:37.229 --> 07:37.844
[Sighs]

07:37.870 --> 07:39.840
Sorry. I'm a little late opening up today.

07:39.894 --> 07:40.890
Busy morning.

07:40.977 --> 07:42.574
You, uh, need anything in particular?

07:42.596 --> 07:44.679
Uh, no, Mrs. Malloy, I'm not here to shop.

07:44.856 --> 07:47.421
I'm from the Western Majestic
Life Insurance Company.

07:47.819 --> 07:51.281
We were recently informed by
the FBI that your husband, Paul,

07:51.288 --> 07:53.171
did not in fact perish
in a boating accident

07:53.182 --> 07:54.616
- in 2010.
- [Sighs]

07:55.413 --> 07:58.039
So the death benefit in
the amount of $200,000

07:58.047 --> 07:59.962
we paid you back in 2012

08:00.636 --> 08:01.871
is null and void.

08:01.884 --> 08:03.555
You have 30 days to pay it back.

08:03.675 --> 08:04.862
My card's attached.

08:05.344 --> 08:07.387
Call me if you have any questions.

08:08.219 --> 08:10.440
[Breathes deeply]

08:14.485 --> 08:15.695
How do they expect me to come up

08:15.706 --> 08:17.879
with $200,000 just like that?

08:18.371 --> 08:19.860
Sorry, you... are you comfortable?

08:19.889 --> 08:20.682
Hmm, yes.

08:21.493 --> 08:24.282
But you two really don't
need to be fussing over me.

08:24.322 --> 08:26.691
Honey, if there's ever a
time to accept pampering,

08:26.705 --> 08:29.501
it's after giving your magic,
lifesaving blood for six hours

08:29.519 --> 08:30.577
to a virtual stranger.

08:30.581 --> 08:31.819
Are you sure you don't
want another blanket?

08:31.856 --> 08:32.684
I'm fine.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.581
Now, tell me what the
insurance woman said to you.

08:35.585 --> 08:36.849
The FBI told them

08:36.890 --> 08:38.461
that Paul didn't die in a boating accident,

08:38.472 --> 08:39.876
and now they want their money back...

08:40.195 --> 08:40.999
end of story.

08:41.049 --> 08:42.187
Did they miss the chapter

08:42.208 --> 08:44.135
where he's dead now and
that he was murdered?

08:44.172 --> 08:46.153
They should be giving you
more money, not taking it away.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.214
Exactly!

08:47.334 --> 08:49.349
I spent that money when
I thought Paul was dead

08:49.367 --> 08:51.003
and my whole world fell apart.

08:51.468 --> 08:53.388
I can't get that year and
a half of my life back,

08:53.413 --> 08:54.606
but they want their money back?

08:54.811 --> 08:55.923
They don't care that I had to hold

08:55.941 --> 08:58.350
my crying daughter every
night so she can go to sleep.

08:58.408 --> 09:00.088
[Voice breaking] That I am
still repairing the damage

09:00.110 --> 09:02.109
that all of this has done to Lucy and me!

09:02.115 --> 09:03.330
- [Sighs]
- Sit down. It's okay.

09:04.170 --> 09:04.983
Come here.

09:05.427 --> 09:06.597
[Sighs]

09:07.647 --> 09:09.487
I'd be happy to give you a loan.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.349
[Sighs] N... no.

09:11.367 --> 09:13.428
I couldn't do that to our
friendship, but thank you.

09:13.859 --> 09:16.047
Well, it's too bad I can't
ask Calista for a loan,

09:16.068 --> 09:17.061
'cause she's loaded.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.640
Is that why you hang out with her?

09:18.673 --> 09:19.470
I'm not gonna lie...

09:19.510 --> 09:22.287
it doesn't suck being treated to
lunches at the Ivy, but, no, it's...

09:22.407 --> 09:24.990
it's way more than
that. She's unbelievable.

09:24.985 --> 09:27.322
She's super-smart, and I'm
learning a ton from her.

09:27.335 --> 09:29.173
I just... she's somebody I aspire to be.

09:29.205 --> 09:31.294

18:30.744 --> 18:32.492
The hottest staff in town.

18:32.517 --> 18:33.703
I mean, go ahead. Take your pick.

Oh, and there's our Adonis now...

18:35.504 --> 18:36.930

18:36.955 --> 18:39.390
Harry, I'd like you to
meet the photographer...

18:39.776 --> 18:41.026
- Ted Sorkin.
- Ted Sorkin.

18:41.051 --> 18:41.914
Good buddy of mine.

18:41.939 --> 18:43.594
- Nice to meet you. Welcome.
- You look great.

18:43.619 --> 18:44.801
[Chuckles] Ty!

- This is your wardrobe.

18:52.940 --> 18:54.055
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.664
Wh... uh...

18:55.689 --> 18:58.924
Wait, w-why would I wear a
pair of star-spangled underpants

18:58.949 --> 18:59.789
for this photo shoot?

18:59.814 --> 19:01.899
'Cause we're hitting the
newsstands in July, baby.

19:01.924 --> 19:04.039
- Right?
- [Chuckles] Yep.

19:04.071 --> 19:07.024
But what... what's this got to
do with top 10 chefs in L.A.?

- Yeah. I'll give you a moment.

19:17.562 --> 19:20.047
You said "top 10 chefs in L.A."

19:20.072 --> 19:20.985
- Did I?
- Yeah.

19:21.010 --> 19:22.391
No, I'm pretty sure I said "hottest"...

19:22.416 --> 19:25.008
No, no, you distinctly
said "top 10 chefs in L.A."

19:25.304 --> 19:27.899
Eh, tomato, "tomahto."

19:27.924 --> 19:29.563

- But you know what they say?

19:29.762 --> 19:32.344
All press is good press. So just come on.

You are a genius.

- Genius!

- Thank you. Seriously. So much.

19:56.779 --> 19:57.673
No. Oh, no.

19:57.698 --> 19:58.712
I-I'm actually the one
who should be grateful

19:58.737 --> 20:00.430
because I've been so busy
today that I've actually

20:00.455 --> 20:01.914
stopped thinking about
Harry for five seconds.

20:01.940 --> 20:02.837
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!

20:02.862 --> 20:04.657
I- know. [Chuckles]
- Oh, my god.

20:04.682 --> 20:06.868
I mean, yeah, he's...
he's hot and everything,

20:06.893 --> 20:08.310
especially with that sexy accent.

20:08.335 --> 20:10.819
Wait a second. No, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:11.073 --> 20:12.735
- Huh?
- What?

20:12.760 --> 20:15.112
Um, the... did you see Harry somewhere?

20:15.137 --> 20:17.229
Oh, went to the restaurant last week.

20:17.367 --> 20:18.901
W-why?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.909
Um, well, you talking about him so much,

20:20.934 --> 20:23.112
so I figured I had to, you
know, check out the goods.

20:23.137 --> 20:24.387
You would have done the same thing.

20:24.412 --> 20:26.550
Uh... I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't.

20:26.575 --> 20:27.964
It's not a big deal, Joss, seriously.

20:27.989 --> 20:29.289
But you know what? It is a big deal.

20:29.314 --> 20:33.033
I did see a certain dynamic
between him and that bartender.

20:33.198 --> 20:35.409
I think I just saved you a
whole bunch of heartbreak.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.851
Meaning what?

20:37.214 --> 20:38.987
What? Meaning... meaning nothing.

20:39.012 --> 20:40.182
I'm just saying, you know,

20:40.207 --> 20:41.854
you should probably let
him gets his rocks off

20:41.879 --> 20:43.129
before you two settle in.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.706
You should do the same.
Wish I could do the same.

20:45.731 --> 20:47.425
Okay, uh... [Clears throat]

20:47.450 --> 20:49.251
Let me get this straight, Calista,

20:49.276 --> 20:52.028
you... you stalked Harry
like a week ago and... ?

20:52.053 --> 20:54.456
I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't stalk anybody.

20:54.481 --> 20:56.659
It's not like I was
lurking in a bush somewhere.

20:56.684 --> 20:58.687
The restaurant is up
the street from my house.

20:58.712 --> 21:00.499
I went in, sat at the bar, and had a drink.

21:00.524 --> 21:02.194
Yeah, but, Calista, it's
still a little weird.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.508
It happened over a week ago,
and you're just telling me now?

21:04.532 --> 21:06.199
A-actually, you... you
didn't even tell me.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.718
It just sort of slipped out, so I...

21:07.743 --> 21:08.906
Let's not get all dramatic.

I am your friend, Joss. I'm
just trying to protect you.

I mean, the guy is on the verge

21:13.210 --> 21:15.211
of having the biggest
career moment of his life.

21:15.276 --> 21:16.781
It's like dating Justin Timberlake

21:16.806 --> 21:18.445
before he went solo.

21:18.470 --> 21:19.508
I should know. I...

21:19.532 --> 21:21.226
the little songbird broke my heart.

21:21.251 --> 21:22.343
You know what, Calista?

21:22.368 --> 21:24.812
You have no idea the kind
of person that Harry is,

21:24.837 --> 21:26.471
or me, for that matter,
and I don't need your advice

21:26.496 --> 21:27.799
on how to handle my relationships.

21:27.824 --> 21:29.299
I'll take it from here, okay?

Here you go.

21:42.932 --> 21:44.661
Hi! I have great news!

21:44.686 --> 21:46.895
Already? I didn't think
you'd hear back so fast.

21:46.921 --> 21:49.068
Well, I got the insurance company to agree

21:49.093 --> 21:51.056
to half the total amount you owe.

21:51.081 --> 21:54.167
Even better, you can pay in installments.

21:54.327 --> 21:56.872
Uh, that wasn't what we talked about, Toni.

21:56.897 --> 21:58.364
The deal was I pay nothing.

21:58.390 --> 22:00.123
You said that, mama, not me.

22:00.179 --> 22:02.169
Usually, you have to pay something.

22:02.194 --> 22:05.435
Trust me, this is a fair deal,
considering the situation.

22:05.460 --> 22:08.849

22:25.315 --> 22:27.099

22:27.124 --> 22:28.883
As a matter of fact, I have a date tonight.

22:28.908 --> 22:31.536
- Is it a first date?
- Yes, it's a blind date.

22:31.561 --> 22:32.811
Well, you should definitely cancel.

22:33.094 --> 22:34.758
You look like hell.

22:35.112 --> 22:37.849
Do people often compliment
you on your bedside manner?

22:37.874 --> 22:40.357
99% of a relationship's longevity

22:40.381 --> 22:41.637
depends on the first impression.

22:41.663 --> 22:43.758
I'm 99% sure you made that up.

22:44.548 --> 22:46.200
Honestly, how did you land Vivian?

22:46.225 --> 22:48.950
Because first impressions
aren't really your thing.

22:50.145 --> 22:51.739
I was actually on a
date with somebody else.

22:51.764 --> 22:53.143
Why am I not surprised?

22:53.168 --> 22:54.528
We had tickets to the ballet.

22:54.553 --> 22:57.583
Snore. And that's when it happened.

22:57.608 --> 22:59.542
That's when I saw her.

23:03.109 --> 23:06.803
She came on the stage,
and she was... Stunning,

23:07.898 --> 23:11.904
graceful and perfect and walking on air.

23:12.442 --> 23:14.314
It was like suddenly, the
whole room disappeared,

23:14.339 --> 23:16.840
and she was dancing just for me.

23:17.050 --> 23:18.936
And then out of nowhere, she fell.

from the crowd, but...

I was already out of my seat
and halfway to the stage.

23:31.548 --> 23:33.770
to rush into the wings.

23:35.543 --> 23:39.483
I scooped her up, wrapped her knee,

23:40.397 --> 23:43.916
and... Refused to leave until
she agreed to a first date.

23:45.697 --> 23:47.897

- Nope.

I cannot. Not allowed.

get in the way, and pow!

help get me back on top.

37:25.688 --> 37:29.210
It's like all your nerves are
on the outside of your body,

37:29.235 --> 37:32.304
and, you know, I just wanted to
make sure he was worthy of you,

37:32.329 --> 37:35.437
and then I saw him speaking to
that girl, and it annoyed me.

37:35.462 --> 37:38.231
But you know what? It was
my own baggage. It really is.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.242
And I looked at Harry through
my crap-colored sunglasses

37:41.267 --> 37:44.285
because of my situation with
Luca, and I shouldn't have.

37:45.182 --> 37:47.586
Thank you. [Chuckles]

37:47.727 --> 37:49.386
And you know what?

37:49.411 --> 37:51.999
- I actually think you might be right, so...
- I'm sorry?

37:52.024 --> 37:53.441
I went to Wunderbar last night,

37:53.466 --> 37:54.967
and there was definitely a dynamic.

37:54.992 --> 37:56.530
Okay, so... What?

37:56.556 --> 37:57.913
- She's into him.
- Mm-hmm.

37:57.938 --> 37:59.922
Big deal. We don't know if he's into her.

37:59.947 --> 38:01.202
And even if he is into her,

38:01.227 --> 38:02.523
we don't know if anything's happened yet.

38:02.548 --> 38:05.007
- Come on, it...
- But what, Joss, what do you want?

38:05.290 --> 38:06.632
Seriously. Don't think.

38:06.657 --> 38:08.343
- Just what do you want?
- I want Harry.

38:08.368 --> 38:10.999
Then get him and don't let
anybody stand in your way.

38:11.024 --> 38:12.257
Forget it.

38:23.688 --> 38:25.089
Alec: <i> Hey, just checking in.</i>

38:25.114 --> 38:26.190
<i> You probably feel better</i>

38:26.215 --> 38:27.916
<i> but still look terrible.</i>

38:27.941 --> 38:29.735
<i>I'm working on my beside manner.</i>

38:29.760 --> 38:30.935
<i> How'd I do?</i>

38:44.916 --> 38:47.001
What are you doing?

38:47.026 --> 38:49.721
Uh... I'm downsizing.

38:49.847 --> 38:52.058
You might see a few changes around here,

38:52.083 --> 38:54.100
some, uh, belt tightening.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.066
Is this gonna affect the almond butter?

38:56.091 --> 38:57.402
'Cause I notice you buy the good stuff.

38:57.427 --> 38:58.480
Yep.

38:58.505 --> 39:00.394
Thanks to you and what you shared,

39:00.419 --> 39:04.339
I am taking responsibility
for <i> my</i> situation.

39:04.364 --> 39:05.482
What situation?

39:07.055 --> 39:09.247
I, uh...

39:09.272 --> 39:11.120
I kept Paul's insurance money,

39:11.145 --> 39:13.330
even after I knew Paul wasn't really dead.

39:13.441 --> 39:15.300
I'm basically Carmela Soprano.

39:15.325 --> 39:17.316
Minus the acrylic nails and hot pants.

39:17.341 --> 39:19.459
[Chuckles]

39:19.484 --> 39:21.636
I guess I felt so entitled to my anger,

39:21.661 --> 39:23.280
I didn't see my own part in it.

39:23.512 --> 39:27.089
Now I do, so let's just
hope we all don't wind up

39:27.114 --> 39:28.355
living in your R.V. as a result.

39:28.380 --> 39:30.181
[Chuckles] Well, you're always welcome,

39:30.206 --> 39:32.730
but I don't think that's gonna happen...

39:33.176 --> 39:35.143
'Cause I'm turning over a new leaf, too.

39:35.168 --> 39:36.534
What is this?

39:36.559 --> 39:37.775
My share.

39:38.299 --> 39:39.850
As long as Scotty and I are here,

39:39.882 --> 39:41.659
I want to contribute to household expenses.

39:41.684 --> 39:43.534
- You don't have to do this.
- Oh, I know.

39:43.559 --> 39:45.309
That's what makes it so awesome.

39:45.538 --> 39:46.738
I'm basically a saint.

39:46.763 --> 39:47.530
[Chuckles]

39:47.555 --> 39:50.530
Oh, and, uh, I rescheduled
that interview with Harry.

39:50.562 --> 39:53.530
I spoke to my sponsor.
He thinks I can handle it.

39:54.030 --> 39:55.629
And so do I.

39:56.738 --> 39:58.917
[Stomping on stairs]

40:08.060 --> 40:11.161
Now, that's gonna be a problem.

40:18.190 --> 40:20.091
[Knock on door]

40:28.446 --> 40:29.695
[Sighs]

40:33.115 --> 40:34.756
I thought we weren't talking.

40:34.756 --> 40:35.561
We're not.
