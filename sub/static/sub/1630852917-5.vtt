39:38.527 --> 39:40.527
and get up on top of my roof,

39:40.529 --> 39:43.730
and then I can really see
out across that flat.

39:43.732 --> 39:46.466
A lot of square miles.

39:46.468 --> 39:47.467
I'm excited.

39:47.469 --> 39:50.403
The kids put in a lot of work,
um, last year,

39:50.405 --> 39:52.872
and, hey, they put a lot
of work into this build.

39:52.874 --> 39:54.941
I'm really proud of them
and their work ethic.

39:54.943 --> 39:57.810
We're gonna be able to, uh,
keep doing stuff like this

39:57.812 --> 39:59.746
as they get older,
and this is just the start,

39:59.748 --> 40:04.417
but just got to, uh,
get this roof on

40:04.419 --> 40:07.487
and get it wrapped up.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.889
Some things I got out here
were tin and plywood.

40:09.891 --> 40:11.357
Those are a real luxury.

40:11.359 --> 40:13.493
I mean, you get stuff
like that out here,

40:13.495 --> 40:16.763
you make sure you don't lose
any of it or waste any of it.

40:16.765 --> 40:19.966
It's a big deal for me
to use that material.

40:19.968 --> 40:21.234
We get a lot of rain here.

40:21.236 --> 40:23.169
I just want to build
something that can last.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.105
I want it to stand up to time.

All right, I'm just getting
my, uh, plywood on my roof.

40:37.719 --> 40:40.186
Next thing I got to do is tin.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.122
Moose season's
right around the corner.

40:42.124 --> 40:45.057
I hope to be sitting
up here with my kids.

40:45.059 --> 40:46.793
It's awesome.

40:55.804 --> 40:58.938
You're gonna make
a couple thousand trips.

40:58.940 --> 41:01.074
Having this woodshed up
and full of wood

41:01.076 --> 41:04.410
is like an Arctic
insurance policy to me.

41:04.412 --> 41:06.146
I know that
if I get hurt this winter,

41:06.148 --> 41:08.214
I don't have to sweat
getting my firewood.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.749
I know it's already there.

41:09.751 --> 41:11.484
I know that I have
enough for the winter,

41:11.486 --> 41:15.555

JESSI: I know. That is
gonna feed us for a while.

41:50.058 --> 41:52.792
Chris and I have come
a long ways this year.

41:52.794 --> 41:56.863
A hard couple months

Good job on the tree stand.

42:42.644 --> 42:45.311
Way to whip it,
you guys worked hard.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.580
Final touch right here, okay?

42:47.582 --> 42:50.450
So, this is, this is,
this was your papa's gun rack.

42:50.452 --> 42:53.119
I had this when I was
a little kid around my house...

42:53.121 --> 42:54.187
SYDNEY: Cool.

42:54.189 --> 42:57.190
CHEVIE: and so, here's
a little bit of Papa,

42:57.192 --> 43:00.193
a little bit of
older Roaches here.

43:00.195 --> 43:04.931
You guys get to use this
your whole lives.

43:04.933 --> 43:06.599
Okay, put in
the final screws, you guys.

43:06.601 --> 43:08.935
SYDNEY: And then maybe
if we have any children,

43:08.937 --> 43:10.536
we'll give it to our children.

43:10.538 --> 43:12.939
CHEVIE: Sweet. Okay, Sydney.

43:12.941 --> 43:13.940

43:13.942 --> 43:17.877
Good. All right, guys.
Come over. Group hug.

Love you guys.

43:19.147 --> 43:20.813

CHEVIE: Let's think
about the next project.

43:26.955 --> 43:29.689
JOHNNY: These are sacs
of salmon roe.

43:29.691 --> 43:31.090
It's just the eggs.

43:31.092 --> 43:34.293
You know, if was to just
put this stuff to the side

43:34.295 --> 43:35.895
and say, "I'll deal
with it later,"

43:35.897 --> 43:37.630
it's just gonna rot,
it's gonna spoil,

43:37.632 --> 43:40.366
so as soon I get all of
this meat, all of this fish,

43:40.368 --> 43:43.970
all of this stuff, I have
to immediately start curing it,

43:43.972 --> 43:46.973
um, start preserving it.

43:46.975 --> 43:49.642
You know, this is what it takes
to live this lifestyle.

43:49.644 --> 43:52.244
It was a good day,
got a lot done.

43:52.246 --> 43:54.246
A lot of hurdles,
a lot of challenges.

43:54.248 --> 43:55.114
It might be tiring.

43:55.116 --> 43:57.050
It might wear on me
from time to time,

43:57.052 --> 44:00.920
but, you know, there's not
a lot of instant gratification

44:00.922 --> 44:05.124
with this lifestyle, but that's
not really what I'm after.

44:05.126 --> 44:06.659
You know, I like
putting in the time.

44:06.661 --> 44:08.461
I like putting in the work,

44:08.463 --> 44:11.197
putting in the blood,
the sweat, the tears.

44:11.199 --> 44:12.398
To me, that's way more important

44:12.400 --> 44:15.601
than any paycheck I've ever
gotten or any achievement

44:15.603 --> 44:18.671
or any pat on the back
I've ever received.
