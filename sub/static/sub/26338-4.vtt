04:24.612 --> 04:26.222

05:06.175 --> 05:09.700
They're blocking supplies and
humanitarian aid from reaching

05:09.744 --> 05:10.962
innocent civilians.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.356
This was posted on the Web
20 minutes ago.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.359
My name is Dr. Lena Nakani.

05:16.403 --> 05:19.884
I am chief medical officer
at Georgian Children's Hospital.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.496
Two days ago,
rebels entered Tago,

05:22.539 --> 05:24.367
forcing many to flee the city.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.456
Supplies stopped showing up,

05:26.500 --> 05:30.852
including our weekly shipment
of liquid oxygen.

05:30.895 --> 05:33.942
Currently, we have 12 patients

05:33.985 --> 05:38.076
who require ventilator
assistance to breathe.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.384
Which means,
if a tanker of oxygen

05:41.428 --> 05:44.518
doesn't arrive here
in ten hours,

05:44.561 --> 05:46.084
these children will die.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.348
I am reaching out
to the international community

05:48.391 --> 05:50.480
for help.

05:50.524 --> 05:55.920
If anyone sees this,
please, they need you.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.842
Okay, we're in.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.844
Do we have any idea
where this tanker is?

06:06.888 --> 06:08.280
That's the million-dollar
question.

06:08.324 --> 06:09.804
Our intel suggests
that the driver

06:09.847 --> 06:10.935
fled the violence

06:10.979 --> 06:12.415
and abandoned it.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.895
The hospital can't get
a replacement

06:13.938 --> 06:16.593
because the only oxygen plant
in the area shut down

06:16.637 --> 06:18.421
after its employees stopped
showing up to work.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.988
So they couldn't find
another driver?

06:20.031 --> 06:20.858
MATTY:
They tried.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.251
No one wants the job

06:22.294 --> 06:23.774
now that rebels
have taken over.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.081
And-and what about airlifting
the oxygen to the hospital?

06:26.124 --> 06:28.692
That would work if the rebels
hadn't seized

06:28.736 --> 06:30.302
Georgia's anti-aircraft guns.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.957
They're shooting down everything
flying into the region.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.437
Delivery by land
is the only option.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.308
Which is where we come in.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.485
Correct. You two need
to find that missing tanker

06:38.528 --> 06:40.356
and get it to that hospital,

06:40.400 --> 06:41.966
before it's too late.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.620
The tanker itself is old.

06:43.664 --> 06:44.969
It has no GPS locator.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.493
So our best guess is that it was

06:46.536 --> 06:47.842
abandoned somewhere
on the main road

06:47.885 --> 06:50.105
between the oxygen plant
and the hospital.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.759
You touch down in four hours.

06:51.802 --> 06:54.849
That leaves you six hours
to find a needle in a haystack,

06:54.892 --> 06:57.721
drive it past an army
of violent rebels

06:57.765 --> 06:59.984
in time to save
12 innocent children.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.334
No pressure or anything.Nope.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.597
None at all.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.091
Hey, guys, just a heads-up.

07:20.135 --> 07:21.658
You should be entering
rebel territory

07:21.702 --> 07:22.964
right about now.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.229
You don't say.

07:34.149 --> 07:37.848
Let me guess,
text from your dad?

07:37.892 --> 07:41.156
Yeah. Asking about lunch
sometime next week.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.985
And you're not
even gonna reply?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.423
Oh, come on, Mac.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.207
Would one lunch be so bad?

07:49.251 --> 07:50.644
BOZER: Thank you, Riley.
I've been asking him

07:50.687 --> 07:51.906
that same question for weeks.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.908
Matty, maybe you can
talk some sense into him.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.084
You want me to advise my agent

07:56.127 --> 07:58.303
on his relationship
with my boss?

07:58.347 --> 07:59.130
Mm-hmm.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.263
Tempting, but pass.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.699
MacGYVER:
Look, guys,

08:02.743 --> 08:04.484
I'm avoiding this lunch
because I don't want to sit

08:04.527 --> 08:05.746
and make small talk
and pretend like

08:05.789 --> 08:07.095
everything's normal
when it's not.

08:07.138 --> 08:09.358
And before you say
it's payback,

08:09.401 --> 08:11.534
the guy left me.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.537
I just... I'm not ready
to forgive him yet.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.365
I hear you,
I hear you.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.367
But this is a chance for you
to work on your relationship,

08:18.410 --> 08:20.325
like I am with my father.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.284
And I know you have
unanswered questions for him,

08:22.327 --> 08:23.894
so something tells me
there's a deeper reason

08:23.938 --> 08:25.330
you're avoiding him.

08:25.374 --> 08:26.549
BOZER:
Dang.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.116
Check out Ms. Freud over here.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.471
You gonna tell us
what it is, Mac?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.691
Or are you gonna
make us guess?

08:40.432 --> 08:42.304
Bozer, didn't you say
that tanker truck was

08:42.347 --> 08:43.653
silver and blue?Way to dodge the question.

08:43.697 --> 08:46.264
Yeah. Why?

08:46.308 --> 08:47.657
I think we just found it.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.839
Who steals a tanker of oxygen?

08:55.883 --> 08:57.928
Pull up next to the cab,
and let's find out.

09:09.505 --> 09:12.552
Pull over. Pull over!

09:15.163 --> 09:16.294
Okay, yelling at him
didn't work.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.427
So how do we make him
stop this truck?

09:18.470 --> 09:20.429
We don't.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.039
We stop it for him.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.259
Pretty sure that's Mac code
for "I'm about to do something

09:24.302 --> 09:25.652
really dangerous."Yeah.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.785
Get as close to the cab
as you can, and don't swerve.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.047
Okay. Don't swerve.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.396
Don't swerve. Don't swerve.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.052
I said, "Don't swerve!"

09:35.096 --> 09:36.750
RILEY:
I'm not.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.443
Drop it.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.184
Drop it.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.493
Thank you.

10:24.536 --> 10:28.366
Now, what were you doing
stealing this truck?

10:28.410 --> 10:30.455
I'm not stealing it.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.327
Then what would you call
what you were doing?

10:32.370 --> 10:33.720
I'm delivering.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.418
Lives depending on this oxygen.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.941
Where were you
taking it, then?

10:37.985 --> 10:41.336
To its original destination:
the children's hospital.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.860
Yes, it's true.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.383
My son is, uh,
is-is patient.

10:45.427 --> 10:46.994
He... Look, he...

10:47.037 --> 10:49.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.No. It's-it's okay.

10:49.344 --> 10:52.347
It's photo. My...

10:52.390 --> 10:55.132
Photo, my son.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.744
Before he was
hospitalized.

10:57.787 --> 11:01.399
When my wife and I learned
that the shipment wasn't coming,

11:01.443 --> 11:02.618
I decided to...

11:02.662 --> 11:04.359
Track the truck down
and deliver it yourself?

11:04.402 --> 11:05.534
Yes.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.057
Well, aren't you worried
about the rebels?

11:07.101 --> 11:08.232
They're killing
everyone on sight.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.712
I'm only worried
for my son

11:09.756 --> 11:12.062
and the children
in the hospital.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.326
Look, sir...

11:15.370 --> 11:17.415
No, my name is Vasil.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.461
Vasil. I'm MacGyver.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.115
This is Riley Davis.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.682
We were sent by a
government organization

11:22.725 --> 11:24.596
to deliver this truck
to the hospital.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.207
It's true?

11:26.250 --> 11:27.512
Yeah.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.384
This is the best news
I've heard in days.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.125
Please, please,
can I come with you?

11:31.168 --> 11:32.779
I-I can help you.
Yes, you-you...

11:32.822 --> 11:34.563
Uh, no, I don't think
that's a good idea, Vasil.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.043
This could get dangerous.RILEY: Mac.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.566
We can't leave him here, Mac.
If the rebels find him...

11:40.438 --> 11:42.397
Let's go save your son.Thank you!

11:42.440 --> 11:44.486
Thank you. Thank you.

11:44.529 --> 11:47.445
What was that?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.885
Matty

11:51.928 --> 11:53.147
You guys hear that?

11:53.190 --> 11:54.452
Heard and saw, Mac.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.498
It's the rebels. They're
blowing up all the roads

11:56.541 --> 11:57.978
leading into the city.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.284
Which is a huge problem,
because we only have four hours

12:00.328 --> 12:02.199
until the oxygen
in the hospital runs out.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.210
Mac, we checked
every road into the city

12:13.254 --> 12:15.212
and confirmed the rebels have
blocked or destroyed them all.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.562
All right, so if
the roads are out,

12:17.606 --> 12:20.217
how are we gonna get this
oxygen to the kids, Mac?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.479
We'll make
our own road.

12:21.523 --> 12:22.393
We'll cut through those
mountains right there,

12:22.437 --> 12:23.699
and we'll find
a paved road

12:23.743 --> 12:25.222
on the other side
of the rebels' perimeter.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.311
I'm sorry,
Mr. MacGyver,

12:27.355 --> 12:29.009
but that is just
not possible.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.011
I know this area
very well.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.490
It's very rough.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.885
This vehicle
will never make it.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.366
You're right, we won't make it
in this vehicle.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.455
We'll have to give it
an upgrade.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.241
What is upgrade?

13:01.476 --> 13:02.869
What you are doing?

13:02.912 --> 13:04.740
I'm trying to stabilize
this rebound clip.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.883
You are using your cell phone?

13:16.926 --> 13:18.536
Yeah, well,

13:18.580 --> 13:20.451
as it turns out,

13:20.495 --> 13:21.888
it fits perfectly.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.368
I-I wish Vano was
here to see this now.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.718
He would say,
"You are awesome."

13:27.545 --> 13:28.895
Vano loves trucks.
Mm.

13:28.938 --> 13:32.115
So did I when I was his age.
Actually, I still do.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.377
You know what?

13:33.421 --> 13:34.901
What do you say,
when we get to the hospital,

13:34.944 --> 13:36.816
we ask the doctors
if they'll him see the truck?

13:36.859 --> 13:39.427
Oh, he would love that.

13:39.470 --> 13:43.126
He, uh, has been
in the hospital for so long.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.258
RILEY:
Not to pry,

13:44.301 --> 13:46.129
but what's wrong
with your son?

13:46.173 --> 13:49.306
Ah, his lungs are
not fully developed.

13:49.350 --> 13:50.394
Oh.

13:50.438 --> 13:53.049
Doctors don't know why.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.008
I can't imagine
it's been easy for him.

13:55.051 --> 13:58.620
No, no, it's been
very difficult.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.883
But luckily,

14:00.927 --> 14:02.885
there are still heroes
in the world.
Aw, no.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.496
You're the hero, Vasil.
You tried to drive

14:05.540 --> 14:07.063
this tanker through
rebel-occupied territory

14:07.107 --> 14:08.456
by yourself.

14:08.499 --> 14:11.894
I just did what any father
would do for his son.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.161
MacGYVER:
Okay, good to go.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.381
MATTY: Okay, if the truck is
ready, you need to get moving.

14:20.424 --> 14:23.253
Guys, you've got some time to
make up, so you better go fast.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.477
Guys, what part of

14:29.520 --> 14:31.958
"You've got some time
to make up" wasn't clear?

14:32.001 --> 14:34.438
MacGYVER: We know, Boze,
but if we drive any faster,

14:34.482 --> 14:35.875
then this tanker
could start leaking,

14:35.918 --> 14:38.312
which is a problem because
my build wasn't perfect.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.444
There's lots of metal parts
in contact

14:40.488 --> 14:43.491
with other metal parts,
so if we do start to leak,

14:43.534 --> 14:47.147
any spark could ignite the
liquid oxygen inside and...

14:49.105 --> 14:51.238
On second thought, slow works.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.066
Okay, I ran the numbers.
At your current pace,

14:53.109 --> 14:55.068
you could still make it in time
to save those kids,

14:55.111 --> 14:56.112
but you're cutting it close.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.332
Yeah, how close?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.724
Let's just avoid
any more delays.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.337
BOZER: Heads up.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.208
We got an unidentified vehicle
moving towards you.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.558
MATTY:
Most civilians have already

15:07.602 --> 15:09.952
fled the area, so unless
you guys ordered Domino's,

15:09.996 --> 15:11.345
that's probably rebel patrol.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.651
Have they spotted us yet?

15:13.695 --> 15:14.826
I don't think so.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.959
The terrain seems
to have kept you hidden,

15:17.003 --> 15:18.526
but if you stay
on that current heading,

15:18.569 --> 15:19.831
you're gonna run
right into them.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.007
Guys, there's a large
cluster of trees

15:21.050 --> 15:22.617
northeast of your position.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.879
You can make it,
but you have to hurry.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.141
This time for real.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.582
Those trees right there.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.300
♪

16:14.103 --> 16:16.105
♪

16:38.519 --> 16:40.695
Breathe, Bozer,
breathe.

17:04.545 --> 17:05.633
Okay.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.852
You're clear.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.119
My heart is racing.Yeah, mine, too.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.555
MATTY:
Time to get moving.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.599
You've got kids to save.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.090
That didn't sound good.

17:34.531 --> 17:35.750
Yeah, we're stuck.

17:44.759 --> 17:47.675
We're in a dried-out creek bed,
and part of it collapsed

17:47.718 --> 17:48.632
under our
front tire.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.765
We hung the truck.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.463
We... we don't have
time for this.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.771
How are we gonna
do this, Mac?

17:56.814 --> 17:59.426
Thing's got to be
about 60,000 pounds.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.343
Mac?Uh...

18:04.822 --> 18:06.650
He-he don't answer you.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.261
Yeah, believe it or not,
that's a good thing.

18:08.304 --> 18:09.740
Means he has an idea.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.367
Put it in neutral
and turn the engine over.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.499
This-this is going
to raise truck?

18:29.543 --> 18:31.458
Yeah, it should.
How?

18:31.501 --> 18:33.112
Well, it's basically
the same way

18:33.155 --> 18:35.375
a firefighter's
lift bag works.

18:35.418 --> 18:38.465
The operating pressure
of the suspension airbag

18:38.508 --> 18:41.598
is multiplied by the surface
area in contact with the frame,

18:41.642 --> 18:44.514
which gives you lifting force
in pounds per square inch.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.689
I-I-I don't
follow you.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.778
Yeah, yeah, you
get used to that.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.696
VASIL:
Oh, it's working!

18:52.740 --> 18:53.828
This is miracle!

18:53.871 --> 18:55.134
No, it's just physics.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.961
We should be back on the road
in five minutes.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.268
I'm going to call my wife
and check on my son,

18:59.312 --> 19:01.140
tell her
we're coming.

19:01.183 --> 19:04.578
Devoted husband and father.
That's a good man right there.

19:08.669 --> 19:09.800
I'm sorry.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.846
You all right?

19:17.286 --> 19:19.114
Earlier, you were saying

19:19.158 --> 19:21.203
you were gonna try and work
things out with Elwood.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.293
I mean, do you really think
that he's capable of change?

19:24.337 --> 19:27.166
Probably not.Well, okay, then why bother?

19:28.776 --> 19:30.517
'Cause I don't expect
Elwood to change.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.909
I've accepted who he is.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.824
Maybe I'm naive, but...

19:33.868 --> 19:36.958
I still have hope
our relationship can heal.

19:38.438 --> 19:41.354
And I never want to regret
not giving us a second chance.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.965
There's a rebel
patrol coming.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.836
We must go now!

19:45.880 --> 19:47.664
Tire's still an inch
below solid ground, Mac.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.058
You think we can make it?One way to find out. Let's go.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.075
Great work.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.208
You're back on the road
and have just over two hours

20:09.251 --> 20:11.035
until the oxygen
at the hospital runs out.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.342
Since it should only take you
90 minutes to get there,

20:13.386 --> 20:14.604
I think we're all good.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.656
Damn it, Bozer, why'd you
have to go and say that?

20:22.699 --> 20:24.919
This is problem.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.707
Make that two problems.

20:44.721 --> 20:45.896
Mac, they're closing fast.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.420
Any chance you got a plan?MacGYVER: Yeah.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.030
Riley's gonna floor it.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.119
You sure that's a good idea?I don't know,

20:51.162 --> 20:52.425
but it's not gonna matter
if they catch us.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.253
Yeah, good point.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.084
RILEY:
Not that I'm complaining, but...

21:00.128 --> 21:02.304
why aren't they
shooting at us?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.045
VASIL: They want
our cargo intact.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.916
The, uh, liquid oxygen
is-is, uh, worth a lot of money

21:05.960 --> 21:07.178
on the black market.

21:12.532 --> 21:15.274
What's what

21:23.673 --> 21:26.328
We sprung a leak.
I got to go up top.

21:26.372 --> 21:29.157
Are you crazy? We are doing
120 kilometers per hour.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.334
Yeah, I mean, I'm not
looking forward to it, but...

21:32.378 --> 21:34.641
if I don't plug the leak,
we're not gonna have

21:34.684 --> 21:37.252
enough oxygen left by the time
we get to the hospital.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.993
And that's best-case scenario.

21:39.036 --> 21:41.561
What is worst

21:41.604 --> 21:44.781
Well, a stray spark hits
the liquid oxygen, and, uh...

21:49.046 --> 21:50.309
How will you fix it?

21:50.352 --> 21:51.614
Good question.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.530
Wait a second,
that water bottle

21:54.574 --> 21:56.184
over there--
can you hand me that?

21:56.227 --> 21:58.360
ThisThanks.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.014
Liquid oxygen is cryogenic,

22:00.057 --> 22:03.278
which means it's stored
below 297 degrees Fahrenheit.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.019
That valve
is so cold right now,

22:05.062 --> 22:06.977
all I have to do
is pour water onto it,

22:07.021 --> 22:10.154
and, uh, it should freeze
instantly, creating a seal.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.244
He say "should"?

22:13.288 --> 22:15.421
Be happy.
That's as much of a guarantee

22:15.464 --> 22:17.205
as you're gonna get from him.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.176
Riley, on your right.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.315
Mac, hang on to something.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.728
Mac, you're about
to have company.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
I said no sparks!

23:36.284 --> 23:38.373
Yeah, or you could say,
"Thanks for saving my life."

23:38.417 --> 23:40.244
Be careful, be careful!

23:46.120 --> 23:48.688
Leak's sealed.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.411
Ugh, damn it,
I can't shake 'em.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.499
BOZER:
Mac, now would be a great time

24:17.543 --> 24:18.892
to do something brilliant.

24:18.935 --> 24:19.936
MacGYVER:
Working on it.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.679
Uh...

24:23.723 --> 24:24.724
Hold.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.497
Whoa.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.242
Okay. I think we're clear.

25:05.286 --> 25:07.244
Okay, just stay
on that road.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.376
It'll lead you
right to the hospital.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.859
Yeah, until we run out of gas.

25:12.902 --> 25:15.775
Uh, yeah, we just burned
through all of our fuel, and...

25:15.818 --> 25:18.865
No, no, I know
a fuel station very near here.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.040
Pretty sure, uh,

25:20.083 --> 25:21.476
no rebels are there.
It is safe.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.651
Okay? I take you.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.306
Okay, take us.

25:29.310 --> 25:32.226
RILEY:
What's on your mind, Mac?

25:32.269 --> 25:34.358
That obvious?

25:35.838 --> 25:38.232
Thinking about
what you said earlier,

25:38.275 --> 25:40.495
about you and Elwood
and second chances.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.672
You know, there was
actually a time

25:43.716 --> 25:46.109
when I really wanted
a relationship with my dad.

25:46.153 --> 25:47.807
But now that time's passed,

25:47.850 --> 25:49.678
because you're too angry
with him.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.419
Yeah.

25:53.029 --> 25:56.772
Yeah, I just cannot seem
to let this anger go.

25:58.731 --> 26:01.429
When I was a kid,
especially after my mom died,

26:01.472 --> 26:03.910
I idolized him.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.738
He was smart and tough,

26:05.781 --> 26:08.828
and the way he made things out
of nothing absolutely amazed me.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.525
And then when he left

26:10.569 --> 26:13.441
without saying a word,
it was like...

26:13.484 --> 26:17.967
I tried to convince myself
there was a good reason.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.622
You know, like,
maybe he had amnesia

26:20.666 --> 26:23.712
and couldn't find his way home,
or he was framed for a crime

26:23.756 --> 26:25.192
and wrongfully imprisoned.

26:27.020 --> 26:30.240
Then years passed,
and eventually, I just gave up

26:30.284 --> 26:33.548
believing there was
a good reason.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.637
I began to forget
what he once meant to me

26:35.681 --> 26:38.205
and started imagining
he was a drunk or a criminal.

26:38.248 --> 26:39.598
Picturing him
as someone

26:39.641 --> 26:41.469
you didn't want
made it easier to accept

26:41.512 --> 26:42.731
he didn't want you.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.255
Been there.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.649
But then 18 years go by,

26:47.693 --> 26:50.391
he comes back, and as it turns
out, he runs an organization

26:50.434 --> 26:52.088
dedicated to saving
innocent lives.

26:52.132 --> 26:55.004
It was a lot easier when
I thought he was a bad guy.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.093
But you understood
him then.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.486
Now it's complicated.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.053
And that scares you.

27:00.096 --> 27:01.445
MATTY: Guys, you got a truck.
It's coming in hot.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.360
Vasil, get to the cab now.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.580
Get a move on, guys.
They're right on top of you.

27:11.586 --> 27:12.587
Don't move.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.634
These don't look
like rebels, Mac.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.202
VASIL:
That's because they are not.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.643
Vasil, what the hell
is going on?

27:24.686 --> 27:28.298
Remember when I told you liquid
oxygen was worth a lot of money?

27:29.648 --> 27:30.736
Well, it is.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.346
And my friends and I

27:32.389 --> 27:34.870
are going to sell this
truck and keep the money.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.176
You set us up.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.177
I'm sorry.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.178
You son of a bitch.Riley...

27:42.138 --> 27:44.010
VASIL:
You were right.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.707
I was stealing the truck.

27:45.751 --> 27:48.797
Local conflicts are good
for that sort of thing.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.021
You knew where we
were taking it.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.762
You said you were
taking it there, too.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.546
The on-board
navigational system

27:58.589 --> 28:00.374
told me where the
truck was going.

28:00.417 --> 28:01.810
That's the only
reason I knew.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.682
And thank you

28:03.725 --> 28:05.553
for getting me past the rebels.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.686
I could never have done it
without you, MacGyver.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.862
So your whole story
was a lie, then?

28:09.905 --> 28:13.126
I have a wife and
three children.

28:13.169 --> 28:16.129
They're not sick, but they
are very much in danger.

28:16.172 --> 28:19.219
That's why I need the money--
to get them to safety.

28:19.262 --> 28:20.786
So you're gonna let
all those other children die?

28:20.829 --> 28:22.701
I'm not proud of it.

28:22.744 --> 28:27.836
But if the choice is between my
children and complete strangers,

28:27.880 --> 28:29.359
what can I say?

28:29.403 --> 28:31.622
Family first!

28:41.720 --> 28:43.722
We got just over an hour

28:43.765 --> 28:45.724
till those kids run
out of oxygen, Mac.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.464
What are we gonna do?

28:49.075 --> 28:51.077
I don't know.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.258
MATTY:
You're not listening.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.129
We don't have time
to ask for permission

29:00.173 --> 29:01.391
from the minister of health.

29:01.435 --> 29:04.307
I am talking minutes.
Not hours, not days.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.527
I understand that. But without
her authorization, I...

29:09.530 --> 29:11.575
Armenia's out, too.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.882
Tell me someone has good news.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.101
Bozer?

29:16.667 --> 29:18.582
Turkish ambassador says
there's a hospital

29:18.626 --> 29:20.323
just over the border,
40 minutes away.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.543
They have a full tanker
of liquid oxygen,

29:22.586 --> 29:23.849
but he's refusing
to send any of his people

29:23.892 --> 29:25.111
into rebel-occupied territory.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.330
What do I do? Am I
allowed to threaten him?

29:27.374 --> 29:29.071
Just hang up.

29:29.115 --> 29:31.726
Mac, Riley,
I don't know what to say.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.032
We've reached out to everyone

29:33.075 --> 29:34.598
in your area, looking
for replacement oxygen,

29:34.642 --> 29:36.035
and we've come up empty.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.514
Any luck on your end?

29:37.558 --> 29:39.429
Mac's phone is still
on the tanker, so I traced it,

29:39.473 --> 29:40.648
but it's so deep
in rebel territory,

29:40.691 --> 29:42.432
if we tried to go get
it, we'd bet killed.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.869
Does that mean we're
out of options?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.087
MacGYVER:
Not entirely.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.567
If we can't bring
the oxygen to the kids,

29:46.610 --> 29:47.829
we'll have to bring
the kids to the oxygen.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.613
What are you talking about, Mac?

29:49.657 --> 29:50.832
I'm talking about a medevac.

29:50.876 --> 29:53.095
A medevac? Oh, no, no, no.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.967
A medevac? It's impossible.

29:55.010 --> 29:58.187
These children
are in no shape to be moved.

29:58.231 --> 30:01.364
And even if they were,

30:01.408 --> 30:05.542
we have diluted the O2 mix
as much as we can.

30:05.586 --> 30:10.417
At most, we have 50 minutes
before they start suffocating.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.941
Look, I know that transporting
them isn't ideal,

30:12.985 --> 30:14.856
but there's a hospital
40 minutes away in Turkey.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.424
If we borrow vehicles, we should
be able to make it in time.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.600
Not with the rebels outside.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.558
They will attack
any convoy immediately.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.781
I'm-I'm sorry.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.000
Hold on.

30:29.392 --> 30:30.654
Is that normal?

30:31.786 --> 30:32.874
I'm afraid so.

30:32.918 --> 30:35.181
Great.
Where's your maintenance guy?

30:36.617 --> 30:39.402
He says you're right.
The, uh, lights upstairs flicker

30:39.446 --> 30:41.274
because we are running
on backup power.

30:47.497 --> 30:51.588
Uh, all life-saving equipment
is on battery backup,

30:51.632 --> 30:53.721
but the nonessential
parts of the hospital

30:53.764 --> 30:55.157
and the rest of the city

30:55.201 --> 30:56.724
use this.

31:02.469 --> 31:03.731
He says that beyond
this airlock

31:03.774 --> 31:05.776
is a compressed air chamber,

31:05.820 --> 31:07.778
which the city uses
to create and store energy

31:07.822 --> 31:09.476
for when the power goes out.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.608
This is great.

31:11.652 --> 31:12.827
What does this mean?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.437
This means we don't have
to move the kids.

31:14.481 --> 31:17.484
All we have to do is connect the
outflow valve from this chamber

31:17.527 --> 31:18.920
to the hospital's
oxygen converter,

31:18.964 --> 31:20.748
which should refill the O2 tanks

31:20.791 --> 31:22.097
and supply breathable air
to the kids.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.664
RILEY:
Why didn't the hospital

31:23.707 --> 31:24.926
do this immediately?

31:24.970 --> 31:26.493
Uh, that's my fault.
I just made that sound

31:26.536 --> 31:27.798
a lot easier
than it's actually gonna be.

31:27.842 --> 31:30.410
There's over a
thousand PSI in there,

31:30.453 --> 31:32.673
which is like being a half
a mile under the ocean.

31:32.716 --> 31:34.153
If you go in there
without protection,

31:34.196 --> 31:35.763
you won't last long.

31:35.806 --> 31:37.286
MATTY:
And I assume you have a plan

31:37.330 --> 31:39.680
to make the necessary
protection?

31:39.723 --> 31:42.770
I do, but I'm not sure
if it's gonna work.

31:42.813 --> 31:45.425
Look, just so it's been said
out loud,

31:45.468 --> 31:48.123
there's still time for that
medevac if you leave now.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.820
And to be clear,
Bozer means right now,

31:49.864 --> 31:50.996
so it's decision time.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.823
Mac, it's your boots
on the ground,

31:52.867 --> 31:54.869
so it's your call.

31:56.305 --> 31:59.482
Moving the kids has variables
I can't control,

31:59.526 --> 32:02.268
which means more risk.

32:02.311 --> 32:05.749
I say we stay
and take our chances...

32:07.360 --> 32:09.666
...in there.RILEY: Okay.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.190
What do we need to do, Mac?

32:11.233 --> 32:13.322
Follow me.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.432
Thanks.

32:36.476 --> 32:39.609
All right, so all this
is to help you survive a room

half a mile under the ocean?

32:42.177 --> 32:44.963
I mean, not forever, but yeah.How?

32:45.006 --> 32:46.660
The same way an
atmospheric pressure suit

32:46.703 --> 32:48.749
helps deep sea divers survive
at the bottom of the ocean.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.142

version of one, yeah.

Okay, this is the last canister
we have, and it's nearly empty.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.062
It's not enough oxygen
to save the kids,

32:57.105 --> 32:59.586

39:59.397 --> 40:02.661
But I'm glad
I took that chance.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.619
And as brave as you are,

40:04.663 --> 40:07.013
I know you'll be glad, too.

40:24.987 --> 40:27.207
Order up.

40:35.215 --> 40:36.564
And here's your
egg salad sandwich

40:36.608 --> 40:38.523
and side of steak fries.Thank you.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.350
Not that it's any
of my business, hon,

40:40.394 --> 40:42.309
but who is it that
you keep waiting for

40:42.352 --> 40:44.180
week after week?

40:44.224 --> 40:46.444
Me.

40:48.315 --> 40:49.882
My son.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.623
Could I get a menu?
I'm starving.

40:51.666 --> 40:52.667
WAITRESS:
Of course.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.806
Sorry I'm late, Dad.

41:00.849 --> 41:02.938
It was worth the wait.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.030
French fry?

41:08.074 --> 41:09.467
They're good.
