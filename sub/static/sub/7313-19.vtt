WEBVTT

00:11.054 --> 00:12.838
Damn.
You gain weight, Hill?

00:12.882 --> 00:15.015
No, it was too much beer.
[hiccups]

00:15.058 --> 00:18.061
Hey, puke on me,
and I'll leave you right here.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.410
All right.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.982
Adams?

00:27.984 --> 00:30.073
Yo, Adams,
come on, man.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.596
Get up.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.033
You hear me?

00:35.296 --> 00:37.124
[sighs]
Come on, man.

00:37.167 --> 00:41.476
I'm not gonna drag both your
sorry asses back to the ship.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.130
Adams, come on,
we're back by 0600--

00:43.173 --> 00:44.522
[gasps]

01:25.389 --> 01:27.304
ZIVA [whispering]:
It's been over an hour,

01:27.348 --> 01:29.480
and still not one word.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.134
I know. It's heaven.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.180
ZIVA:
I'm worried, McGee.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.182
What if he's sick?

01:35.225 --> 01:36.922
He'd be whining.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.315
He always whines
when he's sick.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.709
You two really suck
at whispering.

01:40.752 --> 01:44.626
Believe it or not,
I can hear you.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.018
And I'm not sick.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.933
Every once in a while,
I just need to power down.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.065
Be still.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.545
Reflect on this little trip

01:50.588 --> 01:52.547
through the cosmic rip.
I...

01:52.590 --> 01:55.158
I need to find
my deep calm.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.029
Yeah, he's sick.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.292
[chuckling]:
Yeah.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.381
Let's check for a fever.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.122
What is this?

02:05.037 --> 02:06.822
Last year's performance
appraisal review.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.476
Hah!
How did you get this?

02:08.519 --> 02:11.435
The NCIS fairy left it
under my pillow.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.741
What do you think?

02:12.784 --> 02:13.872
You stole it?

02:13.916 --> 02:15.222
[gasps]
Ooh, McGee.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.049
Gibbs wrote something
in the comment section.

02:17.093 --> 02:20.923
"Agent DiNozzo displays
exemplary skills,

02:20.966 --> 02:23.230
[chuckling]: though he can be
too talkative in the field."

02:23.273 --> 02:24.970
McGEE: If, by too
talkative, he means

02:25.014 --> 02:26.407
you never shut up.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.235
Well, I think Gibbs was being
a bit too gracious.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.976
After ten years, he doesn't know
this is how I work.I always thought

02:31.020 --> 02:33.065
it was like a mild case
of Tourette's or something.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.110
It's my process.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.242
You guys know that.

02:35.285 --> 02:37.026
It-It's how I focus, you know.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.158
I talk it out.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.985
Talkative. Hah!

02:40.029 --> 02:41.813
Com-Coming from a
functional mute,

02:41.857 --> 02:43.163
that's rich.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.599
Maybe that's what he's...

02:44.642 --> 02:46.340
Maybe that's what he's doing.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.385
He's trying
to tell me something.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.082
Maybe I should dial it back.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.215
Get...

02:52.259 --> 02:53.651
Get my quiet on.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.566
[laughs]I think you're, uh,

02:55.610 --> 02:57.177
overreacting a bit, Tony.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.091
I'm gonna kill
the next performance appraisal.

02:59.135 --> 03:02.530
Next time he writes down, in his
little margin here, "DiNozzo:

03:02.573 --> 03:05.794
"professional; DiNozzo: focused.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.187
DiNozzo..."

03:07.230 --> 03:09.189
Too much yabba yabba.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.668
Sorry boss, I was just...

03:12.104 --> 03:13.236
...suppressing the yabba?

03:13.280 --> 03:14.716
Good.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.021
Grab your gear.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.632
Got a dead petty officer
in Baltimore.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.114
So now it's too much yabba
yabba? When did that happen?

03:22.158 --> 03:23.594
In the womb would be my guess.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.120
ZIVA: Any chance we may bump
into your old coworkers?

03:28.164 --> 03:29.905
Or even Wendy, perhaps?

03:29.948 --> 03:33.604
Wendy and I decided to
leave it alone for now.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.215
Really?
Yeah.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.781
Turns out Ol' Blue Eyes
was wrong.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.262
Love isn't always lovelier
the second time around.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.482
In fact, it's kind of
painful and strange.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.005
Yabba.
Enough chit-chat, Ziva.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.485
A man's got to work.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.622
McGee.Wallet was found near the body.

03:51.666 --> 03:52.884
No cash.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.625
Victim is Caleb Adams.

03:54.669 --> 03:58.281
23, petty officer second
class on the DD-350 Hagen.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.501
It's a destroyer docked
for liberty at Chesapeake Bay.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.111
Check for surveillance
in the area.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.243
Those two with him?

04:03.286 --> 04:04.505
McGEE: They said
they found him this way.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.593
I'm still getting the details.

04:05.636 --> 04:06.333
Doc?

04:06.376 --> 04:07.986
Abrasions on his hands

04:08.030 --> 04:11.163
and face indicate
the possibility of a fight

04:11.207 --> 04:14.819
which was ended
by this single stab wound.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.125
Ugly.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.431
That's it, Tony?

04:17.474 --> 04:18.649
Only one word?

04:18.693 --> 04:19.955
No wisecracks

04:19.998 --> 04:22.218
about wayward sailors
on shore leave?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.395
No obscure
On the Townreferences?

04:25.439 --> 04:26.570
Is that a movie?

04:26.614 --> 04:28.093
ZIVA:
I understand that sailors

04:28.137 --> 04:30.357
often refer to this liberty

04:30.400 --> 04:33.055
as their annual
beer-and-crabs week.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.665
Not those kind of crabs, Ziva.

04:34.709 --> 04:35.536
DUCKY:
Ah!

04:35.579 --> 04:37.233
There's the Tony

04:37.277 --> 04:38.365
we know and love.

04:38.408 --> 04:39.583
McGEE:
Boss,

04:39.627 --> 04:41.629
Baltimore PD's got a
suspect in custody.

04:41.672 --> 04:42.760
Got a 911 call

04:42.804 --> 04:44.109
about Petty Officer Adams

04:44.153 --> 04:45.589
before the sailors found him.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.331
Came from a auto-repair shop
two blocks away.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.680
Said they found a mechanic there

04:49.724 --> 04:52.117
trying to wash blood
off his hands and jacket.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.423
[siren whooping]

05:00.474 --> 05:02.519
Got the suspect's
jacket.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.392
Lot of blood, boss.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.484
Is this your jacket?

05:10.527 --> 05:13.225
Look, I'm being railroaded here.

05:13.269 --> 05:13.965
What's your name?

05:14.009 --> 05:16.141
Michael Thomas.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.578
You got a lawyer to
call, Mr. Thomas?

05:17.621 --> 05:19.797
No, I want to call someone else.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.283
They've got this
all wrong, Leon.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.241
Just do what they say, Michael.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.678
I'll take him
to processing.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.376
Your wife's kid brother?

05:33.420 --> 05:35.291
He's my family, too, Gibbs.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.337
Then you'll be
recusing yourself.For what reason?

05:37.380 --> 05:38.642
He's a murder suspect, Leon.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.383
Those are your rules, not mine.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.950
I'm well aware, Gibbs,

05:41.993 --> 05:44.344
but as long as he's
your suspect, I'm going, too.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.880
Gibbs, give us a minute.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.751
Is that a problem?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.150
All right, just
tell me, Michael.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.412
Tell me you didn't do this.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.588
Leon, no, I was just trying
to help the guy.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.111
And you didn't know
Petty Officer Adams?

06:13.155 --> 06:14.591
You'd never met him?

06:14.635 --> 06:16.506
I've never seen him before
this morning, hand to God.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.334
Look, the cops got it
all wrong, man.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.640
You know I would never do this.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.337
You gotta believe me.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.470
You believe me, right?

06:27.430 --> 06:29.127
Yeah.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.042
But it's not me you
need to worry about.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.392
No, please,
just don't tell Jackie.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.264
And it's not
your sister, either.

06:35.307 --> 06:37.179
Gibbs is my best agent.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.441
Convince him.

06:38.485 --> 06:41.183
Tell him the truth,
everything will be okay.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.272
Minute's up.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.537
[door closes]

06:49.583 --> 06:51.323
No record.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.847
This your first arrest?

06:52.890 --> 06:54.718
First and only.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.459
I'm a good person,
Agent Gibbs; ask Leon.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.678
I'm not asking him.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.114
I'm asking you.

06:59.157 --> 07:01.246
MICHAEL: Well, I just meant
he knows who I am.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.031
He knows I'd
never kill anybody.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.163
Cops say they found you
with blood on your hands.

07:05.207 --> 07:07.252
I was trying to stop that kid
from bleeding to death.

07:07.296 --> 07:08.471
GIBBS: They said that
you were asking skittish.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.733
That you couldn't get
your story straight.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.039
They wouldn't let me talk.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.388
I tried to tell them
what happened.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.476
They wouldn't listen.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.435
They just assumed I was lying.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.831
Okay.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.051
I'm listening. Talk.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.966
Well, I was headed
into work on 57th.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.707
Today was my day to
open up the shop.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.100
So I took the 5:00 a.m. bus
into town.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.494
Just got off and headed
down State Street,

07:31.538 --> 07:34.149
and that's when I heard...

07:34.192 --> 07:36.412
It was awful.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.502
It sounded like
a dying animal.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.679
And I-I got to the corner,

07:42.723 --> 07:45.508
and that's when I saw him.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.555
And he-he was lying there
on his side, and, um,

07:48.598 --> 07:51.601
there was all this blood and...

07:51.645 --> 07:54.343
But he was still alive.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.736
What time was that?

07:55.779 --> 07:57.215
It was just after 5:30.

07:57.259 --> 07:58.782
Okay, then what?

07:58.826 --> 08:00.610
Well, he-he reached out his hand

08:00.654 --> 08:02.177
like he was asking for help.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.527
I tried to apply pressure
to the wound,

08:04.571 --> 08:06.790
but it was too late;
he was gone.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.531
GIBBS:
When did you call 911?

08:08.575 --> 08:11.229
I called from my cell
on the way to work

08:11.273 --> 08:12.840
about a quarter to 6:00.

08:12.883 --> 08:14.232
You left him there?

08:14.276 --> 08:16.191
I felt bad,
but I had to leave.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.409
GIBBS: Man was dead?Yeah.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.411
My boss gets mad if I'm late.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.197
I need this job, Agent Gibbs.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.590
Did you tell

08:23.633 --> 08:25.548
the 911 operator that
Petty Officer Adams was dead?

08:25.592 --> 08:26.767
I gave them the location,

08:26.810 --> 08:28.464
my name, the address
where I was at.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.074
There any other witnesses there
at the scene?

08:30.118 --> 08:32.773
Just me; that's why I called
as soon as I could.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.862
I didn't want
to leave him out there alone.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.519
You ever watch someone die?

08:41.564 --> 08:43.479
Not me.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.527
Now I can't stop
seeing his face.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.311
You know, his eyes.

08:51.835 --> 08:55.186
I swear, I'll never forget
his eyes as long as I live.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.586
MICHAEL:
He wasn't breathing.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.544
I saw him die.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.110
There was blood... Oh, God.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.808
DISPATCHER:
Okay, sir, calm down.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.461
Tell me where he was;
I need an address.

09:09.505 --> 09:10.811
MICHAEL:
In an alley off of 57th.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.726
You-you got to send someone
out there.

09:12.769 --> 09:15.337
DISPATCHER:
We will, but I need you to stay
on the line with me, okay?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.818
Police say the call
came in at 5:47 this morning.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.863
Tracks with Michael's account.Sounded genuinely upset.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.517
Connection to the victim?None that I can find.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.171
I searched e-mail accounts

09:23.214 --> 09:24.868
and phone records
for both Michael Thomas

09:24.912 --> 09:26.261
and Petty Officer Adams.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.610
No communication
between them.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.785
Michael's boss said that Adams

09:28.829 --> 09:30.178
was never a customer
at the shop.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.135
Background.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.137
Petty Officer
Caleb Adams

09:33.181 --> 09:34.922
joined the Navy
right out of high school,

09:34.965 --> 09:37.838
had two overseas deployments
and a spotless record.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.405
C.O. called him a bright
and hardworking man.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.582
Assigned to the Hagendestroyer
in 2010.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.062
Adams was one of 215 sailors off
the ship last night for liberty.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.586
TONY:
Tracking down others

09:46.629 --> 09:48.457
who may have been with him,
but we do have this.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.503
He called someone
named Meredith Bilson

09:51.547 --> 09:52.853
five times in five hours.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.029
The last call came in
at 4:34 a.m..

09:55.072 --> 09:56.421
That's an hour
before his death.

09:56.465 --> 09:57.727
Location?

09:57.771 --> 09:59.120
Apartment manager
at her last known address

09:59.163 --> 10:00.643
says she hasn't lived there
in three months.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.557
Keep looking. What else?

10:01.601 --> 10:02.863
ZIVA:
Checking account

10:02.906 --> 10:03.951
shows one charge last night

10:03.994 --> 10:05.300
at Sposare's Pizza
in Baltimore

10:05.343 --> 10:06.649
just before 3:00 a.m.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.695
Pizza and beer--
that's a hell of a last meal,

10:08.738 --> 10:09.783
right, bo...?

10:11.915 --> 10:13.613
Go.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.528
Boss, we may have a situation.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.008
That was the
ship's commander.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.837
All 215 sailors reported back
for duty this morning.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.186
All except
Petty Officer Adams

10:22.230 --> 10:23.623
and this man...

10:26.103 --> 10:28.628
21-year-old
Petty Officer Brian Smith,

10:28.671 --> 10:30.194
from Virginia.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.500
Maybe a second victim?

10:31.543 --> 10:33.110
VANCE:
Or maybe involved.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.592
No way to know that yet.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.637
Figure it out.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.770
Go on.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.432
PIZZA MAN:
Hey, I'm just grateful
for this time of year.

10:50.475 --> 10:54.697
Liberty Week, the sales
almost double my regular day.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.568
But you do not remember
ever seeing

10:56.612 --> 10:57.918
Petty Officer Adams
this morning?

10:57.961 --> 11:00.398
No. It's a real shame
about that kid, but no.

11:00.442 --> 11:01.704
I-I never saw him.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.706
I mean, look around.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.622
Not exactly easy telling
'em apart, you know.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.668
I think it was
Mae West who said,

11:08.711 --> 11:11.322
"You've seen one sailor's
anchor, you've seen 'em all."

11:15.979 --> 11:18.895
No, I just kind of meant
that it gets hectic in here.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.158
You know, all of 'em
in here at once.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.726
A bunch of 'em all
yelling for service.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.554
Anyone get out of control,
start a fight?

11:25.597 --> 11:26.990
Oh, no, nothing like that.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.384
No, no, these are
all good kids.

11:29.427 --> 11:30.777
I-I never had any trouble.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.561
Are you guys here about Caleb?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.129
I'm Seaman Robert Epplund.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.696
We were on the Hagen
together.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.567
You knew
Petty Officer Adams?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.003
We were friends, yeah.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.179
I just found out what happened.
I can't believe it.

11:42.223 --> 11:44.007
He was doing fine
when I saw him last night.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.139
What time was that?

11:45.182 --> 11:47.532
Uh, like, 11:00 or so.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.013
His crew was the first section
off for liberty,

11:50.057 --> 11:51.232
we were the second.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.799
He was in a great mood.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.104
He was going
to see his girlfriend.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.671
Like, totally in love with her.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.542
He kept saying
she was the one.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.022
"The One's" name
wouldn't happen

11:59.066 --> 12:01.068
to be Meredith
Bilson, would it?

12:01.111 --> 12:02.547
Yeah, that's her.

12:02.591 --> 12:03.679
Does she know?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.681
We'll stay in touch.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.856
Thank you.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.771
Thanks.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.731
The director has always been
very protective of his family.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.123
That should come as no surprise.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.559
No, it's not just that.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.779
It's something else.
Can't put my finger on it.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.738
And you're worrying
that whatever "it" is

12:18.781 --> 12:21.262
may prevent the director
from seeking the truth?

12:21.305 --> 12:23.264
It's not him, Duck. It's me.

12:23.307 --> 12:24.700
Family or not.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.703
I gotta do my job.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.139
Do you have news,
Dr. Mallard?

12:29.183 --> 12:30.706
I was just about to
brief Agent Gibbs.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.925
Good. Let's hear it.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.404
Well, as suspected,

12:33.448 --> 12:34.841
Petty Officer Adams' death

12:34.884 --> 12:36.320
was caused
by a single stab wound.

12:36.364 --> 12:39.846
The knife perforated
his spleen and stomach,

12:39.889 --> 12:42.326
resulting in massive
internal bleeding.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.198
The angle of the blade suggests

12:44.241 --> 12:47.070
that he was attacked
from the front, straight on.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.637
He was face-to-face
with his killer.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.073
So, maybe he knew the person.
They were familiar.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.684
Not necessarily.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.686
DUCKY:
Prints that we managed
to lift from the body

12:54.730 --> 12:56.819
are being analyzed as we speak.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.821
Was there anything unique
about the weapon?

12:58.865 --> 12:59.996
Not that I could see.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.650
No, the-the edges

13:01.693 --> 13:04.261
of the wound
were precise and clean,

13:04.305 --> 13:06.263
with no evidence
of a serrated blade.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.830
But Ms. Sciuto

13:07.874 --> 13:09.963
is performing further tests
on the tissue.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.051
What about the bruises, Duck?

13:11.094 --> 13:14.010
Ah, they're informative,
actually.

13:14.054 --> 13:17.840
They had begun to change color,
and that tells me

13:17.884 --> 13:21.888
that the fight occurred
several hours beforehis death.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.890
So he fought with someone
other than his killer?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.326
It's possible.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.849
It's also possible that the...

13:26.893 --> 13:28.068
Killer came back
to finish the job.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.552
VANCE:
Thank you.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.089
[whirs, powers down]

13:49.132 --> 13:50.786
Michael didn't do it, Gibbs.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.961
I never said he did.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.484
And despite my ties to him,

13:53.528 --> 13:55.008
I won't try and sway
this investigation.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.183
I never said that, either.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.750
Oh.
[phone ringing]

14:00.056 --> 14:01.188
Hey, honey.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.843
Yeah, I'm sorry
I didn't call you back.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.933
No, I don't think I'm gonna
make it home for dinner.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.413
Looks like it's gonna be
a late one here tonight. Yeah.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.850
No, no, everything's fine.

14:10.893 --> 14:14.897
Just a lot going on,
back-to-back meetings.

14:14.941 --> 14:15.942
Yeah.

14:15.985 --> 14:16.943
[whirs, powers up]

14:16.986 --> 14:19.989
I love you, too.

14:20.816 --> 14:23.471
It's complicated.

14:23.514 --> 14:26.735
Family, Leon.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.955
Always is.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.532
So, you think my
chattiness is annoying?

14:41.576 --> 14:43.752
I think you asking me
about your chattiness

14:43.795 --> 14:46.973
non-stop for the past
20 minutes is annoying, yes.

14:47.016 --> 14:51.020
Want to know who else thought my
chattiness was annoying? Wendy.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.631
She said it made me sound
nervous and insecure.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.503
Like that's even
possible.
Stop it, Tony.

14:55.546 --> 14:56.939
It was one little comment
Gibbs made, okay?

14:56.983 --> 14:57.940
Nothing more.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.202
[doorbell chimes]

14:59.246 --> 15:01.335
And as for Wendy, I
believe you were right

15:01.378 --> 15:03.467
to turn the book on
that relationship.

15:03.511 --> 15:06.340
Turn the page, close the book,
but... yeah, I guess I was.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.516
Oh.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.386
Meredith Bilson?

15:09.430 --> 15:10.735
Who are you?

15:10.779 --> 15:12.912
Special Agent Anthony
DiNozzo. This is

15:12.955 --> 15:14.739
Agent David. NCIS.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.959
We need to talk to you
about your boyfriend,

15:17.003 --> 15:18.091
Petty Officer Caleb Adams.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.919
Is s-something wrong?

15:19.962 --> 15:20.876
May we come in?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.530
Uh, uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

15:22.573 --> 15:23.879
I can't right now.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.533
Hey, Meredith.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.579
Petty Officer
Brian Smith?

15:28.623 --> 15:30.842
Yeah.
There's a whole ship
full of people looking for you.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.323
May want to put a shirt on.
You're coming with us.

15:36.022 --> 15:36.892
Stay with her.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.941
Stop!

15:45.988 --> 15:46.902
Look out!
Whoa!

15:47.555 --> 15:48.948
I said stop!

15:51.341 --> 15:55.215
[grunting]

15:55.258 --> 15:56.825
[panting]
Hey!

15:56.868 --> 15:59.262
I know a dead guy with bruises
just like yours.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.612
[panting]

16:16.018 --> 16:17.063
Look at it.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.196
Oh, is that a little
tough to look at?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.938
Here, how about this one?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.722
Maybe a closer shot.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.421
I didn't do that.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.118
It wasn't me.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.773
Says the guy who just ran
two blocks to get away.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.035
I can explain everything,
all right?

16:33.079 --> 16:34.080
Oh, you can?!

16:34.123 --> 16:35.951
Well, thank goodness for that.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.345
'Cause finding you in the dead
guy's girlfriend's apartment

16:38.388 --> 16:39.955
with your pants
around your ankles

16:39.999 --> 16:41.739
doesn't exactly scream innocent.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.525
In my business,
it's called motive.

16:44.568 --> 16:45.961
Think I killed him for Meredith?

16:48.050 --> 16:50.009
People kill for a lot less.

16:50.052 --> 16:53.664
MEREDITH:
I woke up around 6:00,
and Brian was pounding

16:53.708 --> 16:55.318
on my door.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.451
Said he and Caleb got
into a fight.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.626
Was that fight was about you?

17:01.585 --> 17:04.893
I didn't want to tell Caleb
over the phone, but...

17:04.936 --> 17:08.157
he called right after
he got off the ship, and

17:08.201 --> 17:09.985
he wanted to come over,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.205
and I said no.What time was that?

17:12.248 --> 17:15.077
Just after
11:30, I think.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.949
I told him I was sorry.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.213
I didn't mean to hurt him,

17:20.256 --> 17:22.389
but I couldn't help how I felt.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.784
I told him
I was in love with Brian.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.482
And he...

17:28.525 --> 17:29.918
lost it.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.789
SMITH:
Next thing I know, Caleb's

17:31.833 --> 17:33.791
dragging me behind some store.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.358
Starts pounding on me.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.099
I fought back
for a little bit,

17:37.143 --> 17:39.710
and finally,
I pushed him off me,

17:39.754 --> 17:41.321
then I ran.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.323
Never saw him again.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.541
Then where'd you go?

17:44.585 --> 17:47.544
Walked around for a while,
cleared my head.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.938
Got to Meredith's around 6:00.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.592
That was seven hours
after the fight.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.724
You just
walked around

17:53.768 --> 17:55.248
clearing your head?

17:55.291 --> 17:56.988
Caleb was my best friend,
all right?

17:57.032 --> 17:59.121
I would never hurt him.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.515
We grew up together,
went fishing every weekend.

18:01.558 --> 18:03.691
We were
practically brothers.

18:03.734 --> 18:08.435
Look, I know I'm a bad person
for betraying Caleb that way.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.003
But I didn't kill him.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.005
MEREDITH:
The last time Caleb called

18:14.049 --> 18:16.007
he was rambling.

18:16.051 --> 18:19.054
Saying that he was gonna
win me back, buy me a ring.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.143
He sounded
so out of it.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.798
He was slurring
like he'd been drinking.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.323
Caleb hardly ever drank.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.933
And that was
the last time you spoke?

18:28.977 --> 18:30.631
I can't believe

18:30.674 --> 18:32.415
I'm never
gonna hear his voice again.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.243
Meredith, look at me.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.812
Do you think Brian killed Caleb?

18:37.855 --> 18:40.815
No, of course not.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.862
But...

18:48.127 --> 18:49.737
I washed it.

18:49.780 --> 18:50.912
What?

18:50.955 --> 18:52.740
Brian's shirt.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.831
There was a lot of blood.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.181
I asked him if it
was from the fight.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.183
He wouldn't answer me.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.447
I got scared.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.232
He was acting so crazy.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.277
I didn't know what to do.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.934
I washed it.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.503
I'm so sorry.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.421
Doesn't look good
for our shirtless wonder.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.205
His alibi is
definitely shaky,

19:23.249 --> 19:25.120
but we also cannot
ignore the fact

19:25.164 --> 19:26.426
that she washed
his bloody shirt.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.297
Ah, to be young
and in love.
Huh!

19:28.341 --> 19:30.865
McGee, any surveillance video
from near the crime scene yet?

19:30.908 --> 19:33.172
No, but I got something
else. Come here.

19:33.215 --> 19:37.176
It's about Michael Thomas,
and it's not good.

19:37.219 --> 19:40.179
As if Gibbs isn't in a tough
enough place with the director.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.050
Turns out
that Michael has a record.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.399
As a juvenile.

19:43.443 --> 19:46.402
I got a hit on a charge
in Maryland from 1996.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.056
Records were sealed.Come on.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.536
Let's not panic, okay?

19:49.579 --> 19:51.712
Kids do stupid stuff.
May not mean anything.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.148
Well, it depends on the charge.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.323
Assault with a deadly weapon.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.020
Ugh.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.153
Well, that goes beyond stupid.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.242
Agent Gibbs.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.722
Is Leon coming, too?

20:01.765 --> 20:05.247
Assault with a deadly weapon.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.206
You left that one out
the last we talked.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.686
Uh, well, I was... I was just...

20:09.730 --> 20:12.123
just a dumb kid
who-who didn't know any better.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.125
I mean, it wasn't
that big of a deal.

20:14.169 --> 20:15.126
You put someone in the hospital.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.606
I'd-I'd say that was a big deal.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.173
What's this got to do
with anything?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.435
One: you lied to me.

20:19.479 --> 20:20.958
Two: you have the potential
for violence.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.656
Yeah, when I was 14 years old.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.920
Look, I-I admit, I had some
tough times as a kid, you know?

20:25.963 --> 20:28.096
And-And I made a mistake.
I lashed out.

20:28.139 --> 20:30.359
But I learned from it,
and I moved on.

20:30.403 --> 20:31.665
It never happened again.

20:31.708 --> 20:32.883
What else don't I know?

20:32.927 --> 20:34.276
I told you everything,
Agent Gibbs.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.800
I didn't do this!
Why can't you just accept that?

20:36.844 --> 20:39.281
Because a young man is dead,
and I can't accept anything yet.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
All right, that's enough.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.243
Michael,
don't say another word.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.426
You should be focusing
your energy

20:53.469 --> 20:55.297
on real evidence,
real suspects.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.298
Michael is a suspect.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.647
The only person you need

20:57.691 --> 20:59.693
to be worried about
is Petty Officer Brian Smith.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.130
UA after the crime,
fight with the victim...

21:02.173 --> 21:03.914
I thought you were gonna steer
clear and let me do my job.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.002
Well, maybe I'm not satisfied

21:05.046 --> 21:06.221
with the job
you're doing, Gibbs.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.657
It's not about me,
and you know that.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.094
I'm not just gonna stand by
and let you grill him

21:10.138 --> 21:11.574
about something that happened
16 years ago.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.097
He lied to me, Leon.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.925
What's more important is,
you let him.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.884
That's not true.
His records were sealed.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.929
It still matters.
I told you,

21:18.973 --> 21:20.757
it was complicated.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.368
More than complicated.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.195
Why the kid gloves?

21:29.984 --> 21:31.986
Stand down.

21:38.688 --> 21:41.300
Michael was eight
when Jackie and I met.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.651
Both parents passed away.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.393
Kid was struggling.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.655
I filled a void.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.352
I tried
to steer him right.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.747
Leon, it's tough taking
things like that on.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.402
Yeah, and it wasn't
always easy.

21:57.403 --> 22:00.319
But I got him
into private school,

22:00.362 --> 22:02.451
I got him
into counseling.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.324
He was lost
for a long time, Gibbs,

22:05.367 --> 22:08.283
and now he's finally
finding his way.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.851
The last thing he needs is
people giving up on him.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.679
People like you.
Yeah.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.376
I've come
a long way with him.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.291
I'm not about
to give up on him now.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.337
[phone ringing]

22:20.469 --> 22:22.558
ABBY: Gibbs.Yeah, Abby, I'm on my way.

22:24.473 --> 22:25.561
Talk to me, Abbs.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.302
Hi-- wow.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.652
Director Vance,
what a surprise.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.001
I mean, not like a surprise.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.351
I mean, I know

22:32.394 --> 22:35.310
you have a special interest
in this case because

22:35.354 --> 22:37.225
y-your family member

22:37.268 --> 22:38.400
is involved.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.969
No, that, that is
not what I meant.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.405
I-I am sure

22:43.449 --> 22:46.408
that your brother-in-law
isn't involved.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.976
in anything at, at all.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.456
Ms. Sciuto,

22:50.499 --> 22:52.936
just proceed as if this were
any other case.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.329
Of course. Yes, sir.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.810
So we know

22:56.853 --> 23:00.422
that the killer struck Petty
Officer Adams hard and fast.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.945
The wound is
four inches in length

23:01.989 --> 23:03.425
and five inches
in depth.

23:03.469 --> 23:07.342
The knife was stuck in
once, to the abdomen.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.605
The killer
thrust it in deep

23:09.649 --> 23:11.825
and then tilted it up
and pulled it out.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.087
What's the weapon?

23:13.130 --> 23:14.871
A five-inch boning knife
like this one here.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.787
It's the favorite
of avid fishermen everywhere.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.789
The wound pattern matches
the blade's design,

23:19.833 --> 23:21.704
but that's not all that matches.

23:21.748 --> 23:26.405
The only prints on the body
belong to none other than...

23:26.448 --> 23:30.583
VANCE: Petty Officer
Brian Smith.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.019
You have your guy.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.025
That's a good
thing, right?

23:38.068 --> 23:40.201
Hey, DiNozzo,

23:40.244 --> 23:43.422
search Petty Officer Smith's
belongings.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.685
Weapon's a fishing knife.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.687
I want Michael released
into my custody.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.906
Need to keep him
close, Leon.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.691
I'm taking him
home tonight.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.438
[engines roaring,
tires screeching on video game]

23:59.481 --> 24:00.874
Hey, Dad.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.832
All right, kids, that's
enough of that for now.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.530
Somebody here wants
to say hello.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.488
Hey.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.489
Uncle Michael![Michael laughs]

24:07.533 --> 24:09.491
What's up, man?
Ah, ah...

24:09.535 --> 24:13.364
Wow, my favorite little kids
are not so little anymore.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.365
Are you staying
long this time?

24:14.409 --> 24:15.497
He's not staying.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.545
Kayla, Jared,
go get ready for bed.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.333
I'll be there
in a minute.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.558
I want him out of my house now.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.216
[sighs]

24:51.141 --> 24:53.709
The only time you ever go over
my head is because of Michael.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.145
VANCE:
Jackie, calm down.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.712
JACKIE: What problem are you
bailing him out of now?

24:56.756 --> 24:57.887
It was a
misunderstanding.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.062
Always is.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.586
He was trying to do
the right thing,

25:00.629 --> 25:02.718
he ended up a
murder suspect.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.633
A murder suspect?

25:04.677 --> 25:05.939
We have the killer
in custody, Jackie.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.375
He didn't do it.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.159
Of course he didn't,
but how does he get

25:09.203 --> 25:10.204
in these messes
in the first place?

25:10.247 --> 25:11.510
And with you dragged
into it?

25:11.553 --> 25:12.859
This is different.
Is it?

25:12.902 --> 25:14.295
I mean, his whole life
has been one bad decision

25:14.338 --> 25:15.905
after another,
always knowing

25:15.949 --> 25:17.646
that you're gonna be there
to save the day.People change.

25:17.690 --> 25:22.129
Leon, you have fathered
him long enough.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.261
When are you gonna let him
stand up on his own two feet?

25:24.305 --> 25:26.350
He's getting ready to open
a repair shop, Jackie.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.396
Hisrepair shop.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.877
And two years ago he was going
to finish college.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.879
A year before that,
he was, he was selling

25:32.922 --> 25:34.358
that, that,
that miracle drink.

25:34.402 --> 25:35.838
Well, at least he's
trying, Jackie.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.710
He's come a long way
from where he was.

25:37.753 --> 25:41.278
You do not need
to remind me

25:41.322 --> 25:43.324
where he was.

25:44.368 --> 25:48.111
You know that I love him
and I always will,

25:48.155 --> 25:51.071
and I had to let him go
and I ju...

25:51.114 --> 25:54.248
I just wish you would,
too, you know?

25:57.251 --> 25:59.862
Hey.

25:59.906 --> 26:03.649
I don't know why I had to be
married to such a good man.

26:03.692 --> 26:04.954
[chuckles]

26:04.998 --> 26:07.000
Who I'm still mad at.

26:09.872 --> 26:12.440
He'll just stay
the night, Jackie.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.137
And he's out
by morning.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.182
Yes.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.366
Abbs?

26:25.409 --> 26:26.367
Abby.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.848
Gibbs, oh.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.763
[grunts]

26:30.806 --> 26:32.460
Sorry I woke you.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.331
I woke you.

26:34.375 --> 26:36.682
I woke you first
when I called you.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.640
You spent
the night here?

26:38.684 --> 26:40.120
Yeah, Tony found

26:40.163 --> 26:41.512
the knife in question

26:41.556 --> 26:43.689
in Petty Officer Smith's
seabag, and I kind of got

26:43.732 --> 26:45.081
on a roll testing it,

26:45.125 --> 26:47.257
and the next thing I knew,
the sun was coming up.

26:47.301 --> 26:48.476
Was it worth it?

26:48.519 --> 26:50.086
Totally.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.610
I mean, even with
my little windows,

26:51.653 --> 26:53.350
the light was
just gorgeous.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.831
Abbs, I haven't had
my coffee yet.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.007
Ooh, all right.
The knife.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.009
So it tested
positive for blood

27:00.053 --> 27:01.489
but in the trout family.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.796
These scales that are lodged
in the handle suggest

27:03.839 --> 27:05.406
rainbow or steelhead.

27:05.449 --> 27:06.886
No blood from Adams.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.497
Means Petty Officer Smith
wasn't our killer.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.454
But somebody is.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.499
You know,
it's probably

27:11.542 --> 27:13.022
somebody that we
don't even know yet.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.676
Or someone we do.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.460
Abbs, you stayed here
overnight

27:16.504 --> 27:18.288
trying to clear
Vance's brother-in-law?

27:18.332 --> 27:20.160
Well, the director
is like family.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.249
I mean, you would want me
to do the same for you.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.294
Tox results.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.688
Low doses of methaqualone--

27:26.732 --> 27:29.343
downers, ludes,
disco biscuits.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.301
Very retro but
making a comeback.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.086
It was just enough to impair

27:33.129 --> 27:34.827
Petty Officer Adams'
motor skills.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.219
I mean, these
babies can increase

27:36.263 --> 27:38.744
your sex drive, but it also
can cause drowsiness

27:38.787 --> 27:40.180
and slurred speech,

27:40.223 --> 27:42.008
low heart rate, vomiting...

27:42.051 --> 27:44.140
Ah, well, so much
for the sex part.

27:44.184 --> 27:48.144
So the question is: who
slipped it to him and where?

27:48.188 --> 27:51.626
Well, test everyone who was
on liberty that night.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.758
Can I borrow McGee to help?

27:52.801 --> 27:54.063
Absolutely.

27:55.325 --> 27:56.979
[laughter]And I swear,

27:57.023 --> 27:58.677
your grandma got
these crazy eyes

27:58.720 --> 28:00.069
and took off
after your mom

28:00.113 --> 28:01.854
like a cat
chasing a mouse.Ooh, I can

28:01.897 --> 28:03.638
still see them eyes.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.292
Would Grandma
have chased us, Mom?

28:05.335 --> 28:06.772
Yeah, she sure
would have.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.469
Nah, she'd be spoiling you guys
every chance she got.

28:08.512 --> 28:09.470
Right, Jack?

28:09.513 --> 28:11.472
Yes, Michael, she would have.

28:11.515 --> 28:12.647
Hey, thanks for letting me stay.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.997
Well, the kids
miss seeing you.

28:15.041 --> 28:15.998
I miss them.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.391
Just gonna let the old man sleep

28:17.434 --> 28:19.001
through the party, huh?

28:19.045 --> 28:20.611
Uncle Mike's got
great stories, Dad.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.265
You finish your paper, son?Yep.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.571
Nine whole pages,
single-spaced.

28:23.614 --> 28:24.572
Nice.
KAYLA:
Uncle Mike fixed

28:24.615 --> 28:25.660
the dishwasher.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.748
MICHAEL:
Oh, just a loose valve.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.228
No big deal.

28:28.271 --> 28:29.969
Well, I appreciate that,
Mr. Fix-It, but let's go.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.666
It's my day to drop
the kids off at school.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.841
Can Uncle
Mike come?

28:32.885 --> 28:34.582
Well, he's coming
to work with me,

28:34.625 --> 28:36.584
so I guess that's
the plan, if that's

28:36.627 --> 28:38.064
still the plan.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.718
Up to you.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.503
There are a few things around
here that need repairing.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.201
All right, kids,

28:45.245 --> 28:46.333
go get your things
for school.

28:46.376 --> 28:47.377
I'll be at the car.

28:47.421 --> 28:49.553
Michael.JARED: I call front seat!

28:49.597 --> 28:51.164
KAYLA:
Come on! My turn, Jared!

28:51.207 --> 28:52.818
You got it yesterday!

28:54.863 --> 28:56.822
Now, you're released
into my custody

28:56.865 --> 28:58.693
until this case is
solved, Michael,

28:58.737 --> 29:02.001
so if I let you stay, you do
understand you can't leave.

29:02.044 --> 29:03.742
Yeah, of course,
I'll do whatever you want.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.439
That's the least I owe you.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.615
And, listen, I'm, uh,

29:07.658 --> 29:10.749
I'm sorry again for
putting you through this.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.794
After today, this
is all behind us

29:12.838 --> 29:16.580
and you can get back to
focusing on your repair shop.

29:16.624 --> 29:17.625
You find a space?

29:17.668 --> 29:19.801
Got a few I'm looking at.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.325
I'm gonna pay you back every
dime, you know-- with interest.

29:22.369 --> 29:23.544
And free repairs for life.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.417
Hey, tell your man Gibbs
I'll miss him.

29:27.461 --> 29:28.549
You lay off Special Agent Gibbs.

29:28.592 --> 29:29.985
This hasn't been easy
on him either.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.466
Eh, I don't like
the way he looks at me.

29:32.509 --> 29:35.469
[laughing]:
He looks at everybody like that.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.557
[laughing]

29:40.996 --> 29:42.171
Where is he, Leon?

29:42.215 --> 29:43.390
According
to my morning brief,

29:43.433 --> 29:45.958
you recovered a knife
from the suspect.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.437
It came back negative;
it's not our weapon.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.439
Then what next?

29:49.483 --> 29:50.963
Could Michael be
a flight risk?

29:51.006 --> 29:52.529
VANCE: He's at my house
with his sister.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.574
He's not about
to fly anywhere.

29:53.617 --> 29:56.055
Agents David,
DiNozzo, anything?

29:56.098 --> 29:58.666
Abby found drugs
in Petty Officer Adams' system

29:58.709 --> 30:00.407
that probably impaired him
before he died.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.495
ZIVA: Abby and McGee
are currently testing

30:01.538 --> 30:03.453
[phone ringing]sailors to see if...

30:03.497 --> 30:04.977
There they are.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.761
Video conference.Ziva, put it up.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.201
ABBY:
Hi, Ziva, I...

30:12.245 --> 30:14.377
Whoa, hi, everybody.

30:14.421 --> 30:15.988
What's the latest?

30:16.031 --> 30:18.468
Out of 215 sailors
on shore leave,

30:18.512 --> 30:20.688
three of them tested positive
for some kind of sedative.

30:20.731 --> 30:23.256
ABBY: It's too soon to know
if it was the same drug,

30:23.299 --> 30:24.997
but if I was
a bettin' man...

30:25.040 --> 30:26.520
Interview them there,

30:26.563 --> 30:28.304
find out if any of them were
with Adams before he died.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.305
McGEE:
On it, boss.

30:29.349 --> 30:30.306
Over and out.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.526
I love to say that.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.484
All right, keep me
in the loop.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.704
Like I could keep
you out of it, Leon?

30:44.668 --> 30:46.627
I was in this bar,

30:46.670 --> 30:47.889
you know, having fun

30:47.933 --> 30:50.239
but thinking
about where to hit next.

30:50.283 --> 30:53.025
A bunch of guys were
heading to this...

30:53.068 --> 30:56.289
you know, gentlemen's
club across town.

30:56.332 --> 30:57.638
Go on.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.901
Well, then we,
we hear this guy

30:59.945 --> 31:01.163
bragging about
how he just won

31:01.207 --> 31:04.253
a ton of cash
playing blackjack.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.168
I've never been to Vegas,
much less a casino,

31:06.212 --> 31:09.128
so I figured,
what the hell?

31:09.171 --> 31:10.651
Let's make it rain.

31:10.694 --> 31:11.957
Bad idea, huh?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.437
I lost every dime of liberty pay
inside an hour.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.178
Who was this guy?
Who knows?

31:16.222 --> 31:17.745
Actually, I heard it
from a friend

31:17.788 --> 31:19.225
who heard it from somebody else.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.618
The night was a blur.

31:21.662 --> 31:24.534
I swear that's the last time
I ever gamble this messed up.

31:24.578 --> 31:25.535
Where was this casino?

31:25.579 --> 31:27.973
It wasn't a
casino, it was

31:28.016 --> 31:31.411
a crappy little game
in the back of a-a pizza place.

31:38.897 --> 31:39.941
Hey, hey!

31:39.985 --> 31:41.769
NCIS is back.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.640
How many slices
can I get you gentlemen?

31:43.684 --> 31:45.251
Where's the game?

31:46.339 --> 31:47.993
Whoa, you can't
go back there.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.694
NCIS.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.479
Do not move.

32:06.968 --> 32:10.972
Okay, look, I admit
to hosting the game,

32:11.016 --> 32:13.757
but it was all in good fun.

32:13.801 --> 32:16.369
I mean, all this nonsense
about drugging anybody--

32:16.412 --> 32:17.674
that's just crazy.

32:17.718 --> 32:21.156
Found this in the cabinet
next to the oregano.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.595
Try again.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.032
All right, what can I say?

32:27.075 --> 32:28.990
I'm not proud.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.687
But times are tough.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.689
I mean, who doesn't need
a little extra cash?

32:32.733 --> 32:34.953
Cash off the backs
of young sailors,

32:34.996 --> 32:36.519
serving their
country, on liberty,

32:36.563 --> 32:37.651
in a crooked game?

32:37.694 --> 32:39.044
Hey, the game itself
is not crooked.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.306
We deal straight.

32:40.349 --> 32:42.003
They're ain't no sleight
of hand here.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.049
Just a little shot of this
crap to give you the edge.

32:44.092 --> 32:47.791
What? They don't comp drinks
in Vegas?

32:47.835 --> 32:50.142
You're not Vegas, Marty!
This is a drug.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.404
It's not a drink.

32:51.447 --> 32:53.058
This kid died
playing your game.
Oh, no.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.103
No way! One of these pills--

32:55.147 --> 32:58.977
it'll make you woozy,
but it never killed anybody.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.805
Never.

33:01.849 --> 33:03.720
Tell me about that night.

33:03.764 --> 33:06.027
Ah, kid was breaking our hearts,

33:06.071 --> 33:08.899
telling us about
his girlfriend dumping him.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.772
You know, saying how much
he had to win in order

33:11.815 --> 33:13.513
to buy her an engagement ring.

33:13.556 --> 33:14.949
[laughs]

33:14.993 --> 33:17.560
We kept saying that he should
just forget about her,

33:17.604 --> 33:20.215
but, no, he just
kept playing.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.043
Until you stole
all his money.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.089
I thought about
giving some of it back.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.004
Yeah. That's right.

33:26.047 --> 33:28.049
But then, that kid--
he just went nuts.

33:28.093 --> 33:31.052
Flipped the table over,
and he just ran out.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.227
Where?
How should I know?

33:32.271 --> 33:34.273
[knocking on door]

33:34.316 --> 33:36.666
Hate to break Rule 22, boss,
but his lawyer's here.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.801
Then I'm done talking.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.456
[grunts]

33:43.499 --> 33:45.110
Oops.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.463
Got the same story from
the blackjack dealer.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.378
If what he says
is even half true,

33:52.421 --> 33:54.249
Petty Officer Adams
could have left that game

33:54.293 --> 33:57.035
and picked a fight with
the first person that he saw.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.820
Could be anyone.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.650
Thoughts?

34:03.693 --> 34:05.956
Well, with no security cameras
at the pizzeria,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.741
Ziva and McGee are checking
neighboring stores.

34:07.784 --> 34:10.222
Yeah, I know that. I asked
you your thoughts, DiNozzo.

34:10.265 --> 34:12.659
My thoughts? I thought

34:12.702 --> 34:14.965
you didn't like my process,
my yabba yabba.

34:15.009 --> 34:17.577
Doesn't mean
I don't depend on it.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.448
Oh.

34:19.492 --> 34:22.321
Well, in that case,
the pizza guys are slimeballs.

34:22.364 --> 34:24.366
Thin crust beats
deep dish every time.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.151
And every suspect
in this case

34:26.194 --> 34:27.369
has an answer for everything,

34:27.413 --> 34:29.067
but one of them's got
to be lying.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.243
Yeah? Which one?I don't know.

34:31.286 --> 34:33.549
It's gonna take
a little more yabba yabba.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.551
Good.

34:35.595 --> 34:37.684
Go help Ziva and McGee.

34:37.727 --> 34:39.729
I gotta see a lady
about a card game.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.212
Anything, Abbs?

34:44.256 --> 34:45.953
Four decks scanned, two to go.

34:45.996 --> 34:48.086
Naturally, there's no
shortage of fingerprints.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.913
I.D.'s?
Mostly sailors.

34:49.957 --> 34:51.132
And the blackjack dealer.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.265
Of course.
He touched every card.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.051
You know, it would
help to know

34:57.095 --> 35:00.663
if I was looking
for someone specifically.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.665
Yeah.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.711
Just keep looking.

35:11.631 --> 35:13.198
That the best
you got, McGee?

35:13.241 --> 35:15.156
Well, the only surveillance
of the pizzeria was

35:15.200 --> 35:17.115
from a rooftop
across the street.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.160
Lucky us, all the video files
were corrupted.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.944
But we believe
this is Petty Officer Adams,

35:20.988 --> 35:23.295
based on the time
he is seen leaving the pizzeria

35:23.338 --> 35:24.165
and the direction
he is headed.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.688
Anyone else?

35:25.732 --> 35:28.691
There's this man.
Left a few frames before.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.476
Who is he?

35:30.519 --> 35:31.738
Well, we still don't have
a clear shot

35:31.781 --> 35:32.826
of his face yet, Director.

35:39.615 --> 35:41.530
Wait-- in the window--
is that a reflection?

35:41.574 --> 35:42.705
Enhance it, McGee.

35:49.103 --> 35:50.322
ZIVA:
He appears to be a civilian.

35:50.365 --> 35:51.540
GIBBS:
Sailor said

35:51.584 --> 35:53.325
a guy bragged to him
about winning money.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.543
TONY:
A ton of it, only,

35:54.587 --> 35:56.197
he was too impaired
to remember who it was.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.329
ZIVA:
But the game was rigged,

35:57.372 --> 35:58.547
so no one could have won
a ton of money.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.201
And that would
make that winner a shill.

36:00.245 --> 36:03.204
Somebody's who's in on the con,
lying to recruit players.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.206
It's as good as it gets, boss.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.034
ABBY:
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs!

36:09.079 --> 36:10.255
Director.

36:10.298 --> 36:11.343
Abbs. What?

36:13.388 --> 36:15.390
I got a hit on the prints.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.654
The person...

36:18.698 --> 36:21.222
is in NCIS custody.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.544
Leon!

36:38.587 --> 36:41.111
MICHAEL:
You're cheating...

36:41.155 --> 36:42.896
How do you brake?

36:42.939 --> 36:44.941
[both laughing]

36:50.295 --> 36:52.253
Oh, man, I know that look.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.168
Hey, homework starts

36:54.212 --> 36:55.865
as soon as they're done
kicking my butt, Pops.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.867
Babe, I didn't see the harm.
Dinner's almost ready.

36:57.911 --> 37:01.001
You and the kids get started
without us.

37:03.308 --> 37:04.265
[video game stops]

37:04.309 --> 37:05.919
Come on, come on.

37:05.962 --> 37:08.704
Come on, come on.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.706
Uh...

37:10.750 --> 37:13.013
It was my fault,
not theirs, you know.

37:13.056 --> 37:14.362
I-I pushed them
into playing.

37:14.406 --> 37:15.711
Yeah, you're good at that.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.849
Why did you do it?

37:22.892 --> 37:25.373
The card game.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.549
The kid you found
dying in the street.

37:27.593 --> 37:29.072
No.
How about not
lying to me

37:29.116 --> 37:30.422
for once in your life?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.474
[sighs]
I was trying

37:39.518 --> 37:41.781
to get out from under.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.653
These guys-- they had my money.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.829
Whose money? The money
for the... for the shop?

37:46.873 --> 37:48.831
The money you loaned me--
it wasn't enough.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.791
I thought maybe if I can
double it, maybe triple it...

37:51.834 --> 37:53.314
Behind a pizza place.

37:53.358 --> 37:54.359
Well, small outfit
like that, man,

37:54.402 --> 37:55.795
I couldn't believe
I lost it all.

37:55.838 --> 37:58.450
I couldn't ask you for more,
so they made me a deal.

37:58.493 --> 37:59.625
Bring some fresh meat
to the table,

37:59.668 --> 38:01.322
and I can get you
your money back.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.933
Why? Michael, why?

38:03.977 --> 38:05.239
You were doing so good.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.849
I tried to make it right, Leon.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.677
On my own two feet.

38:08.721 --> 38:11.506
But watching that poor kid
lose his last dime...

38:11.550 --> 38:13.508
I couldn't take it.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.293
I got out of there.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.338
And he came after you.

38:17.382 --> 38:20.428
Yeah, he blamed me for, uh,
bringing him into the game.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.169
He said I ruined his life,

38:22.212 --> 38:24.476
ruined his chances of ever
getting back with his girl.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.956
And then he pulled a knife,
you know, he-he came at me hard.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.003
I tried to get it away,
but he just kept coming at me.

38:30.046 --> 38:32.353
You know?

38:32.397 --> 38:34.355
Everything happened
so fast, Leon.

38:34.399 --> 38:37.140
Next thing I know, he's...

38:39.012 --> 38:41.449
He's face down,
and the knife's in my hands.

38:44.278 --> 38:46.280
It was an accident.

38:47.281 --> 38:49.239
I didn't mean to kill him.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.418
But you did.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.420
Yeah, I know.

38:55.463 --> 38:58.031
Believe me, I know.

38:58.074 --> 39:00.642
I watched him die
right in front of me.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.824
But I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life making up for it.

39:08.868 --> 39:10.826
You know?

39:10.870 --> 39:12.872
If you can help me out,

39:12.915 --> 39:15.396
I promise, I'm gonna
make it up to you

39:15.440 --> 39:18.399
and the whole damn world.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.401
Hand to God.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.453
I will.

39:28.496 --> 39:30.759
I will help you, Michael.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.242
More than I've ever
helped you before.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.702
JACKIE:
No. Please.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.574
Not in the house.

40:04.967 --> 40:07.492
I'm sorry, Jackie.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.718
Me, too, Mike.

40:28.469 --> 40:31.472
I was so close
with him, Gibbs.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.474
He was becoming a good man.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.476
It's not your fault.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.478
You didn't fail, Leon.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.396
It's just time to let go.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.770
[SUV driving away outside]

41:32.577 --> 41:34.361
When's Uncle Mike coming back?

41:38.278 --> 41:40.410
Not for a while, son.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.892
Come on, kids.

41:43.936 --> 41:45.894
Let's leave your dad
be for a few minutes.

41:56.165 --> 41:58.167
[sighs]
Oh, boy.

42:01.736 --> 42:04.391
[anguished sigh]

42:07.612 --> 42:10.832
I'm sorry I played Xbox
before doing my homework,

42:10.876 --> 42:14.575
but it wasn't
Uncle Mike's fault.

42:14.619 --> 42:17.578
I know, son. It's okay.

42:20.102 --> 42:22.104
Jared...

42:27.196 --> 42:29.285
You show me how to play this?

42:29.329 --> 42:31.810
Sure, Dad.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.594
Come here.
