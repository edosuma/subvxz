WEBVTT

01:16.293 --> 01:20.210
I'’m guessing it'’s the relay
or the spark plugs.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.212
I got tools
back at the cabin.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.301
Shouldn'’t be a big job.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.650
Can I help?

01:31.787 --> 01:33.093
Dad?

01:34.398 --> 01:36.357
Yeah. Yeah, sure you can help.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.970
Is there a safe?
At the cabin.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.841
Why?

01:43.015 --> 01:46.193
You got valuables you
trying to hide? No.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.369
Worried I'’m gonna steal
your baseball cards?

01:48.543 --> 01:49.718
No.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.415
I heard you on the phone
the other night.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.113
You said you were
at a safe house.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.812
It'’s just another word
for cabin.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.292
So there'’s no safe?

01:58.466 --> 01:59.858
There'’s a fireplace, though.

02:00.816 --> 02:03.688
Maybe we can roast
some marshmallows.

02:13.437 --> 02:16.092
Hey. Hey. Hey.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.747
Hey. We need to leave.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.444
Right now. Come on.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.098
Dad?

02:30.062 --> 02:31.107
Dad, what'’s happening?

02:40.899 --> 02:43.815
Do not move,
no matter what happens.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.481
You were almost hard to find.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.005
Let'’s have it.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.578
All of it.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.989
Let'’s go in.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.275
Here is how I make decisions.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.105
Win, you live.

04:40.889 --> 04:41.933
Lose,

04:42.543 --> 04:43.848
you die.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.817
Now that'’s too bad.

04:57.645 --> 04:58.820
Snake eyes.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.562
What can I say?
House always wins.

05:02.432 --> 05:03.477
No!

05:07.219 --> 05:08.264
Run!

05:22.539 --> 05:23.801
Kid'’s gone.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.991
Oh!

08:10.011 --> 08:11.882
And the winner...

08:12.666 --> 08:14.015
Snake Eyes!

08:20.021 --> 08:23.328
They call you "Snake Eyes"
and yet you always win.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.680
Of course,
your technique
is a bit crude,

08:26.854 --> 08:28.725
but that has its advantages.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.512
I'’ve been watching you
for a while now.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.471
That ain'’t creepy at all.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.735
When you grow up on the streets,
it'’s them or you, right?

08:38.909 --> 08:43.087
My name is Kenta Takamura,
and I could use a man like you.

08:43.261 --> 08:47.396
Ain'’t nothing personal,
but I don'’t work for guys
like you.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.876
Or anyone,
for that matter.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.835
I know.
You are a drifter.

08:52.009 --> 08:55.230
You fight until no one
will bet against you anymore
and then move on.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.449
Works for me.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.540
They said you
watched your old man get killed
when you were just a boy.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.281
True?

09:05.762 --> 09:07.372
I like to know
who I'’m hiring.

09:11.246 --> 09:15.772
I told you,
I ain'’t interested.
You got the wrong guy.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.948
You haven'’t heard
my offer yet.I don'’t care.

09:18.122 --> 09:23.258
"Homicide victim
recovered from cabin fire
is still unidentified."

09:25.260 --> 09:27.262
My men found it
going through your motel room.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.961
Sounds like the police
could never ID the body.

09:31.135 --> 09:34.269
Nor did they
ever find the killer.

09:34.443 --> 09:38.708
That, Mr. Snake Eyes,
is my offer.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.846
I'’m pretty good
at finding people.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.283
Especially people
who kill other people.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.548
Come work for me,

09:52.722 --> 09:56.030
and I promise you,
I'’ll find the man
who did this.

10:11.915 --> 10:14.526
I'’ll find a spot for you
in my crew.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.616
You can start
at the docks.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.300
Hey.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.875
Uh-oh.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.921
Here comes Fish Boy.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.706
Cover up! Cover up! Cover up!

11:03.880 --> 11:05.534
Let me know
when you get a new joke.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.670
Hey. Easy, easy.
They'’re just kids.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.325
Throw it over. Yeah.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.982
I'’m guessing
you were always picked last
on the playground, huh?

11:19.156 --> 11:20.810
Hey! No, no, no! Huh?

11:20.984 --> 11:22.290
Take it easy.

11:22.464 --> 11:25.293
He meant no disrespect.
Right?

11:25.815 --> 11:27.512
Yeah. Sure.

11:30.037 --> 11:33.170
I don'’t know
what your deal is,
but you have guts.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.178
Boss.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.031
Hey!

12:09.598 --> 12:11.121
Fish Boy.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.256
What'’s going on?

12:16.823 --> 12:18.389
Boss wants to talk to you.

12:19.651 --> 12:20.696
Am I in trouble?

12:22.437 --> 12:23.743
Someone is.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.181
Leave the knife. Mmm?

12:32.229 --> 12:35.015
We operate on one currency.

12:36.451 --> 12:40.672
Not money. Not fear.
Just one simple thing.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.240
Trust.

12:43.414 --> 12:47.201
See, '’cause without trust,
there can be no loyalty.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.725
And without loyalty...

12:51.553 --> 12:53.773
there is no yakuza.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.799
Tommy-san.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.803
You look surprised
to see me.

13:23.977 --> 13:24.934
Kenta.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.631
I wouldn'’t have pictured you

13:26.806 --> 13:31.245
in a place like this
with friends like these.

13:31.419 --> 13:35.075
My cousin here is one of
Japan'’s most powerful sons.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.642
And you are one
of its most disgraced.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.646
This man betrayed our trust.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.955
He'’s an undercover spy,
acting out of loyalty
to his precious clan.

13:46.129 --> 13:52.135
Let'’s show him what loyalty
really looks like.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.368
This is a mistake.

14:16.507 --> 14:19.162
Everything we want in life
comes at a price.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.686
Now do it.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.747
That'’s disappointing.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.749
Kenta!

15:19.135 --> 15:20.136
Hey.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.052
Mind?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.105
Come on.
Let'’s get out of here!

15:42.289 --> 15:44.073
Let'’s go!

17:01.846 --> 17:03.109
Now can we go?

17:21.344 --> 17:22.389
This way!

17:39.841 --> 17:41.712
No, no, no.Kenta!

17:47.805 --> 17:49.807
What an angry boy you are.

17:50.417 --> 17:51.679
You always were.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.155
Tommy, get in the truck!

18:45.733 --> 18:47.038
Anytime you'’re ready.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.610
Come on!All right, I'’m trying!

19:21.421 --> 19:24.250
LAPD. Drop your weapons.

19:25.425 --> 19:26.426
Don'’t move.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.341
You all right?

19:29.342 --> 19:30.386
Yeah.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.606
Just peachy.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.629
Good.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.500
You'’re alive.Tommy.

19:57.674 --> 19:58.675
You'’re safe.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.069
We are going home.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.465
I don'’t have a home.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.380
Not yours.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.164
Mine.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.647
I owe you a blood debt.

20:14.430 --> 20:17.346
You saved my life. Why?

20:19.522 --> 20:20.958
I'’m not a murderer.

20:23.004 --> 20:26.312
I looked into your eyes,
and I saw honor.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.798
So why run guns
for the yakuza?

20:37.714 --> 20:38.802
That was a mistake.

20:38.976 --> 20:41.065
Well, you got that right.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.982
If Kenta
ever sees you again,

20:45.853 --> 20:47.246
you are a dead man.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.080
He called you cousins.

20:59.910 --> 21:02.086
We grew up together.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.699
We were both next in line
to become leader of our clan.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.051
But there can only be one.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.924
So Kenta tried
to have me killed.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.278
When his treachery
was discovered...

21:20.975 --> 21:24.283
I was given
the responsibility
to decide his fate.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.592
I ordered him banished.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.247
And since then,

21:32.421 --> 21:36.773
he has been trying
to seize power
the only way he knows how.

21:38.209 --> 21:41.822
Through greed and violence.

21:41.996 --> 21:46.348
I didn'’t know till today
it was Kenta smuggling
these guns to Japan.

21:47.654 --> 21:48.959
I was ambushed.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.832
You'’re his enemy now too.

21:52.006 --> 21:56.315
Which means
your "Fish Boy" life in LA...

21:57.838 --> 21:59.143
is over.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.021
There'’s no going back.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.548
Hey, where are we heading?

22:37.617 --> 22:38.618
Really?

23:34.195 --> 23:36.240
What is it exactly you do?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.982
A little of this,
little of that.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.858
That your wife?No.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.425
Your girlfriend.Uh-uh.

23:46.599 --> 23:47.774
Sister?

23:47.948 --> 23:51.038
Akiko is our chief of security.

23:51.212 --> 23:55.085
We value her advice,
but we don'’t have to
take it.

24:02.136 --> 24:05.531
The leader of our clan
rarely meets outsiders.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.968
Don'’t forget to bow.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.463
Snake Eyes,

24:24.637 --> 24:28.902
I present the leader
of the clan Arashikage, Sen.

24:31.295 --> 24:32.558
My grandmother.

24:33.602 --> 24:36.562
The man who saved
my grandson'’s life.

24:36.736 --> 24:40.000
We Arashikage
are in your debt,

24:40.174 --> 24:43.264
which means Japan
is in your debt.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.049
Don'’t worry about it.

24:46.223 --> 24:48.791
I'’ll settle for a hot bath
and a plane ticket out of here.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.186
I have a better idea.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.276
Stay.

24:57.713 --> 24:59.672
I want you to join us.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.804
Join the Arashikage.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.808
Sen-sama.
If I may.

25:05.982 --> 25:08.637
Even allowing him
this much access is reckless.

25:08.811 --> 25:11.422
I vouch for him.With respect,
Tommy-san,

25:12.423 --> 25:14.034
you do not lead
this clan.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.384
Not yet.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.299
Someday I will.

25:20.170 --> 25:25.436
And I will need
a warrior like this
by my side.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.050
Someone I can trust
with my life.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.620
For 600 years,

25:34.794 --> 25:39.450
our ninja have brought
peace and stability to Japan.

25:39.625 --> 25:43.759
The secret blade and iron wall
of every government
since the age of Edo.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.979
But things have changed.

25:46.153 --> 25:49.678
New threats
call for new strategies.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.985
Even welcoming outsiders...

25:53.682 --> 25:56.642
as you, of all of us,
should know, Akiko.

26:00.167 --> 26:03.300
Any questions we have about
our new friend,

26:04.650 --> 26:08.828
the Three Challenges
of the Warrior
will answer them.

26:09.002 --> 26:11.787
And will he submit
to the challenges?

26:16.749 --> 26:17.924
He will.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.026
I'’m sorry,
the Three Challenges
of the what now?

26:33.200 --> 26:37.508
The Three Challenges
are designed to reveal
an applicant'’s character.

26:38.858 --> 26:43.123
The first two
will cleanse you
of ego, anger and fear

26:43.297 --> 26:45.342
and ready you for the third.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.650
That'’s the true test.

26:48.824 --> 26:52.175
It will be up to you
whether you wish
to take it.

26:53.263 --> 26:54.525
What if I fail?

26:56.919 --> 26:58.138
You die.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.579
You'’re being serious.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.888
I wouldn'’t put you
in that position
if I thought it was likely.

27:11.717 --> 27:15.329
I can'’t give you
a name or a past...

27:16.765 --> 27:19.463
but I can offer you a purpose.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.857
And something more important.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.425
A home.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.300
And why would you do that?

27:32.433 --> 27:34.827
Because I saw honor
in your eyes, too.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.095
Come.

27:46.273 --> 27:49.885
Get some rest.
You have time to decide.

28:06.902 --> 28:11.385
In the meantime,
consider my home your home.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.911
So your toys,
my toys, huh?

28:18.522 --> 28:20.046
How American.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.781
You'’ll need
to get farther faster.

28:59.955 --> 29:01.435
We don'’t have much time.

29:01.609 --> 29:04.046
The Arashikage are more
than just brute force.

29:04.220 --> 29:07.702
We are spies, scouts,
guardians, infiltrators.

29:07.876 --> 29:12.315
You will be tested,
you will be hurt, you will
suffer, and you will fail.

29:12.489 --> 29:15.928
But the hardest part
will be listening
to you complain about it.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.634
I still think this is a mistake.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.074
Zero hits on his fingerprints.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.947
Nothing on any of our
facial recognition platforms.

29:35.121 --> 29:37.210
This stray dog of yours
is a ghost.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.561
I'’m not scared of ghosts.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.215
I'’m serious, Tommy.

29:42.389 --> 29:44.217
He was working
for the yakuza,
for God'’s sake.

29:44.391 --> 29:46.610
He'’s not one of them.That doesn'’t make him
one of us.

29:48.438 --> 29:49.483
"Us"?

29:54.053 --> 29:55.097
My name...

29:56.316 --> 29:59.928
My name is
Tomisaburo Arashikage.

30:01.408 --> 30:04.454
You think
I would endanger this clan?

30:05.760 --> 30:08.371
I am this clan.

30:08.545 --> 30:11.810
Tommy-san, I wasn'’t
questioning your loyalty.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.551
Just my judgment.

30:17.250 --> 30:19.295
He saved my life, Akiko.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.471
I owe him this chance.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.038
I understand it.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.475
I'’m just worried
you'’re moving too fast.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.782
"Too quick to anger,
too quick to react."

30:27.956 --> 30:30.567
Now you sound like Grandmother.

30:31.786 --> 30:35.834
If I'’m wrong about him,
we'’ll find out tomorrow.

30:37.618 --> 30:40.099
80% of candidates
fail the first challenge.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.622
Just saying.

30:41.796 --> 30:45.844
Well, that means
20% pass, Akiko.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.064
Just saying.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.199
For 600 years,

30:54.026 --> 30:55.810
our fighters have been trained

30:55.984 --> 30:58.987
by the greatest warriors
the world has ever known.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.772
Hard Master.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.087
And most honorable

31:13.523 --> 31:14.916
Blind Master.

31:16.396 --> 31:19.573
From them,
you will learn
how to fight,

31:20.443 --> 31:22.184
how to kill when necessary,

31:22.358 --> 31:24.317
but most importantly,

31:24.491 --> 31:28.495
how to live according to
the Arashikage Mindset.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.149
Abandon ego.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.413
Strike with honor.

31:33.587 --> 31:38.287
Selflessness
and truthfulness
will lead to harmony.

31:39.549 --> 31:40.899
Any questions?

31:42.378 --> 31:43.814
What happens--Silence!

31:45.425 --> 31:46.643
You are nothing.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.732
This challenge
is a waste of time.

31:50.691 --> 31:51.735
You will fail.

31:53.346 --> 31:56.566
Okay, Hard-on Master,
or whatever your name is.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.700
Let'’s go.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.002
Challenge one.

32:44.049 --> 32:47.139
Take this bowl from me.
I'’ll take that bowl
from you.

32:48.401 --> 32:49.706
Okay, I'’ll bite.

32:50.446 --> 32:51.839
What'’s the punch line?

32:52.013 --> 32:55.364
You must take my bowl
without spilling any water.

32:55.538 --> 32:58.759
Fail four times
and your training is over
before it begins.

33:14.601 --> 33:15.689
That'’s one.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.237
Two.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.145
That'’s three.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.148
This is embarrassing.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.586
He has a lot to learn.

34:38.685 --> 34:40.121
Abandon ego.

34:42.254 --> 34:44.734
Selflessness
and truthfulness...

34:46.519 --> 34:48.216
will lead to harmony.

35:11.718 --> 35:13.023
Hard Master.

35:14.808 --> 35:19.160
I humbly request
that you accept my bowl
in exchange for yours.

35:34.349 --> 35:36.351
No congratulations?

35:36.525 --> 35:37.787
One down, two to go.

35:37.961 --> 35:39.441
Congratulations.

35:39.615 --> 35:42.531
If I ever need a bowl of water,
I know who to ask.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.535
You hide it well,

35:46.709 --> 35:49.277
but I can tell you'’re
a little impressed with me.

35:49.451 --> 35:52.062
What I think of you
is irrelevant.

35:52.237 --> 35:55.022
You'’ll survive
the third test
or you won'’t.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.503
Then it won'’t matter at all.

36:00.245 --> 36:03.248
To Tommy, our future toryo.

36:03.422 --> 36:06.947
May you be strong,
wise and honorable.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.253
To Snake Eyes.

36:08.992 --> 36:09.906
May you die well.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.171
Kanpai.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.347
Kanpai!

36:17.653 --> 36:20.047
That word he used,
"toryo."

36:20.961 --> 36:24.530
It means
"head of family."

36:24.704 --> 36:27.489
I am the last of
the Arashikage bloodline.

36:27.663 --> 36:31.580
Ever since I was a child,
I'’ve been groomed to lead.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.583
This is my destiny.

36:36.063 --> 36:41.373
But if I'’m to lead the clan
into the next hundred years,

36:42.243 --> 36:43.810
I have to adapt.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.422
We have to adapt.

36:49.250 --> 36:52.079
I need warriors like you,

36:53.167 --> 36:55.517
who have lived in
and know the new world

36:55.691 --> 36:57.693
but can master
the Arashikage Mindset,

36:57.867 --> 37:01.001
to become
the future of the clan

37:01.175 --> 37:05.353
and fight side by side
as brothers.

37:07.399 --> 37:10.184
Anyway, eat.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.678
Why is Hard Master
staring at me like that?

37:26.548 --> 37:27.549
He isn'’t.

37:28.507 --> 37:29.986
He is very nearsighted.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.686
The Blind Master,
on the other hand...

37:34.904 --> 37:36.602
he is watching you.

37:45.785 --> 37:48.222
They say he knows a liar
when he hears one.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.319
Tommy said
I could borrow
one of his bikes.

37:58.493 --> 37:59.407
His motorbikes?

37:59.581 --> 38:01.017
Yes.

38:04.064 --> 38:05.108
That one.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.002
Keep an eye on the bike.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.387
I didn'’t know
if you would show up.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.869
Why?

39:10.043 --> 39:13.133
Just because you left me to
bleed out on a dock in LA?

39:13.307 --> 39:15.701
All you had to do was
get Tommy on that boat.

39:15.875 --> 39:18.486
Think you could'’ve mentioned
that he'’d wade through 50 yakuza

39:18.660 --> 39:20.880
just for the chance
to kick your ass?

39:21.054 --> 39:23.926
Hey, it worked.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.798
You earned his trust.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.539
You got in.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.889
By the way, how did he like,

39:30.063 --> 39:33.022
"I looked into your eyes
and saw honor"?

39:34.459 --> 39:36.852
He ate it up.I knew he would.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.117
He told me
about your history.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.816
How you tried to kill him
and he cast you out of the clan.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.080
Our family drama
is not your concern.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.430
Yeah, you'’re right about that,
'’cause I'’m out.

39:51.867 --> 39:52.781
We had an agreement.

39:52.955 --> 39:54.304
And I seem to be the only guy

39:54.479 --> 39:56.394
who'’s keeping up his end of it.

39:56.568 --> 39:58.613
And here I had
a gift for you.

40:02.312 --> 40:03.705
You found him.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.505
Where?Easy now.

40:21.810 --> 40:25.118
I kept my word.
Now you have to keep yours.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.163
They want me
to take three tests.

40:28.034 --> 40:29.644
I fail the third, I die.

40:29.818 --> 40:32.430
So whatever
you need me to do,
it better be quick.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.257
It'’s up to you.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.740
There is a priceless artifact
hidden in the castle grounds.

40:40.176 --> 40:42.309
The Jewel of the Sun.

40:42.483 --> 40:45.747
It'’s a symbol
of Arashikage'’s power.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.750
Find the jewel
and bring it to me...

40:50.404 --> 40:52.493
and I'’ll give you
your father'’s killer.

41:44.414 --> 41:46.155
"You'’re welcome."

41:46.329 --> 41:49.507
This place
is built like a fortress.
What are you protecting?

41:50.290 --> 41:51.509
When I was young,

41:52.553 --> 41:56.601
I was told stories
of the Sun Goddess.

41:56.775 --> 42:00.648
Once, long ago,
she wanted to test
the character of her people,

42:00.822 --> 42:05.958
so she sent down a gift
in the form of a jewel.

42:08.656 --> 42:12.442
A jewel that contained
the power of the sun.

42:12.617 --> 42:15.707
We swore an oath
to protect it,
but more important,

42:15.881 --> 42:18.144
to never use it ourselves.

42:18.318 --> 42:20.581
As I grew, I realized why.

42:22.757 --> 42:26.152
We have the power
to destroy anyone
who wrongs us,

42:26.326 --> 42:29.111
but that is
a dangerous temptation.

42:29.285 --> 42:31.940
True power
calls for discipline.

42:34.421 --> 42:38.120
This is Morning Light.

42:39.557 --> 42:43.212
My gift to you
for passing
the first challenge.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.788
It'’s easy
to shoot with a gun,

42:53.962 --> 42:57.575
but the sword
is a weapon of honor.

43:04.930 --> 43:06.409
You know what I mean.

43:12.415 --> 43:13.634
It suits you.

43:15.157 --> 43:18.334
Hey, there was nothing
in that brochure
about a nuclear jewel.

43:18.508 --> 43:19.901
Only a few have access.

43:20.902 --> 43:23.601
My grandmother,
the masters...

43:24.645 --> 43:25.951
and me.

43:26.125 --> 43:28.693
Seems like a lot of protocol
for a fairy tale.

43:28.867 --> 43:32.479
Not protocol.
There'’s a DNA lock.

43:32.653 --> 43:35.482
Like I said,
blood matters
to my family.

44:57.390 --> 44:58.696
What are you doing here?

44:59.740 --> 45:02.177
You.

45:02.351 --> 45:03.657
I was going for a walk.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.573
Mm. With a sword?

45:08.880 --> 45:12.405
I thought it was time to
get serious about my training.

45:12.579 --> 45:15.016
That'’s Morning Light,
a weapon of honor.

45:16.409 --> 45:18.019
What makes you think
you deserve it?

45:18.193 --> 45:20.021
What makes you think
you can use it?

45:21.240 --> 45:22.284
How hard could it be?

45:23.242 --> 45:24.460
Let'’s find out.

45:30.336 --> 45:32.947
How'’d you get that scar?How did you get your name?

45:33.121 --> 45:34.906
I'’ll tell you when
you get to know me better.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.646
If you live that long.

45:39.998 --> 45:42.000
How about a wager?I'’m all ears.

45:43.436 --> 45:45.873
Land one blow on me
and I won'’t cut them both off.

45:46.700 --> 45:48.833
And if I lose?

45:49.007 --> 45:52.750
You tell me why you'’re here.I thought I did.
We'’re training.

45:53.576 --> 45:54.752
Here with the Arashikage.

45:58.538 --> 46:00.235
You'’re on.Hit me.

46:05.371 --> 46:07.677
With your sword.

46:13.945 --> 46:15.337
Come at me like you mean it.

46:24.956 --> 46:27.523
It'’s not your skill
that'’s lacking,
it'’s your heart.

46:27.697 --> 46:30.744
If your heart is pure,
our secrets will reveal
themselves to you.

46:31.310 --> 46:32.398
If not...

46:42.147 --> 46:43.539
they'’ll be your end.

46:45.498 --> 46:46.499
You gonna get that?

46:59.077 --> 47:01.383
A win without honor
is no win at all.

47:04.386 --> 47:05.910
Are you sure it'’s Kenta?

47:06.084 --> 47:08.782
He found a new way
to bring his guns to Japan.

47:10.175 --> 47:12.046
He'’s taking delivery
of a shipment tonight.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.266
If I move fast,
I can get the jump on him.

47:14.440 --> 47:16.485
You have a location?Shinjuku.

47:16.659 --> 47:18.400
I'’ll send a team.No.

47:20.098 --> 47:21.577
I'’ll handle this myself.

47:22.796 --> 47:24.580
You have that look
you get sometimes.

47:24.754 --> 47:26.495
The shadow before a storm.

47:28.454 --> 47:30.717
That storm will pass
when I kill Kenta.

47:34.068 --> 47:35.156
Tommy.

47:36.114 --> 47:37.071
I'’ll come with you.

48:07.406 --> 48:08.973
I'’ll block the alley
from the street.

48:10.148 --> 48:11.845
Tommy,
you handle the rest of them.

48:12.019 --> 48:13.455
And you, secure the weapons.

48:13.629 --> 48:14.761
What about Kenta?

48:14.935 --> 48:16.241
He'’s mine.

48:20.636 --> 48:21.899
They'’re here.

48:53.452 --> 48:54.453
Who are you?

48:56.498 --> 48:57.456
Boys.

52:20.311 --> 52:21.616
Cobra.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.010
This is a lot of firepower.

52:25.838 --> 52:27.666
What does Kenta want
with it all?

52:29.102 --> 52:31.713
To start a war.
With us.

52:31.887 --> 52:35.195
Which means
we'’re gonna need support.
Let'’s call Scarlett.

52:45.945 --> 52:47.903
Major O'’Hara.Give me a second.

52:49.296 --> 52:51.690
I need to take care of
some surprise guests.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.349
Go ahead.

52:59.001 --> 53:00.481
Kenta is back in Tokyo

53:00.655 --> 53:02.353
and aligning with Cobra.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.703
This is recent?

53:04.877 --> 53:06.183
From tonight.

53:07.575 --> 53:08.576
Hang on a sec, okay?

53:24.331 --> 53:26.159
Should we be worried?

53:26.333 --> 53:27.465
About Scarlett?

53:27.639 --> 53:30.381
No. Major O'’Hara
is with the Joes.

53:31.077 --> 53:32.252
The what?

53:32.426 --> 53:34.863
An elite global
counterterrorism unit.

53:35.734 --> 53:36.735
They'’re the good guys.

53:48.877 --> 53:49.878
Cobra.

53:50.052 --> 53:51.315
So what'’s the deal with Cobra?

53:51.489 --> 53:53.360
The deal is,

53:53.534 --> 53:56.102
they'’re a secret
network of terrorist cells,
crime syndicates,

53:56.276 --> 53:58.670
arms manufacturers
and paramilitary groups

53:58.844 --> 54:01.934
linked under
a single centralized command.

54:02.108 --> 54:05.851
A shadow organization
devoted to bringing about
global revolution

54:06.025 --> 54:08.984
through violence,
extortion and fear.

54:13.032 --> 54:14.207
Major?

54:14.381 --> 54:16.862
Major O'’Hara? Major?

54:17.036 --> 54:19.299
I just sent you
a mission brief.

54:19.473 --> 54:22.694
I'’ve been keeping tabs
on an old friend of mine
who just landed in Japan.

54:22.868 --> 54:24.435
I don'’t think
it'’s a coincidence.

54:24.609 --> 54:27.394
Her name'’s Ana DeCobray,
aka "Baroness."

54:27.568 --> 54:29.527
Since we lost touch,
she'’s been busy.

54:31.224 --> 54:32.921
She killed a member
of parliament?

54:33.095 --> 54:35.881
Along with 200 other passengers
on the same train,

54:36.055 --> 54:37.796
just to influence an election.

54:37.970 --> 54:40.102
She'’s been linked to bombings,
assassinations and civil unrest

54:40.277 --> 54:42.017
everywhere from Nanzhao
to Borovia.

54:42.191 --> 54:44.324
In short,
she'’s top-echelon Cobra.

54:44.498 --> 54:47.936
If Kenta'’s linked up
with the Baroness, the threat
to you is significant.

54:48.110 --> 54:50.025
I'’ll be in Tokyo
as soon as I can.

56:59.938 --> 57:02.897
I didn'’t sign up
to work for terrorists.

57:03.071 --> 57:06.205
A little late
to grow a conscience,
don'’t you think?

57:10.731 --> 57:13.734
We each have our own agenda.

57:13.908 --> 57:19.523
There is no reason
this triangle of ours
can'’t be purely transactional.

57:19.697 --> 57:21.829
We all have something
the other wants.

57:24.658 --> 57:25.920
Baroness.

57:26.094 --> 57:30.098
I know who you are
and what you'’ve done.

57:30.272 --> 57:32.666
That rock you want me to steal,
it'’s for Cobra, isn'’t it?

57:35.321 --> 57:36.322
No.

57:36.496 --> 57:38.672
I didn'’t sign up for this.

57:38.846 --> 57:42.589
As I said,
ours is a series
of exchanges.

57:42.763 --> 57:44.896
Kenta wants to
destroy the clan.

57:45.810 --> 57:48.334
The clan
has something I want.

57:48.508 --> 57:50.118
And we have something you want.

57:50.292 --> 57:52.381
Now of course,
if you'’ve had a change of heart,

57:52.556 --> 57:54.340
you are free to go.

57:54.514 --> 57:57.604
But then, so is he.

58:00.433 --> 58:02.479
He goes by Augustine.

58:02.653 --> 58:04.872
The man who
took your father'’s life...

58:06.221 --> 58:07.266
and yours.

58:16.275 --> 58:17.581
Tell me where he is.

58:18.277 --> 58:20.453
Under lock and key.

58:20.627 --> 58:24.631
But I promise you,
back out now

58:24.805 --> 58:27.025
and you will never
see him again.

58:29.810 --> 58:31.377
All that rage...

58:32.726 --> 58:35.033
for all these years.

58:35.207 --> 58:38.253
Are you sure you'’re ready
to give up the hunt

58:38.427 --> 58:40.865
when you'’re so close
to finding peace?

58:44.303 --> 58:45.347
Think about it.

58:47.436 --> 58:49.047
You have three days.

58:50.309 --> 58:51.832
Then I let him go.

59:03.322 --> 59:05.324
Trust me. He'’ll do it.

59:06.673 --> 59:07.631
He'’d better.

59:08.414 --> 59:09.981
Or I kill you both.

59:19.686 --> 59:23.342
Every warrior has a weakness
your enemy can exploit.

59:23.516 --> 59:27.128
The second challenge
will expose it.

59:27.302 --> 59:31.742
To avoid harm,
you must first learn
how you harm yourself.

59:32.699 --> 59:34.962
Most can'’t manage and fail.

59:37.965 --> 59:39.793
Where is everybody else?

59:39.967 --> 59:42.796
This test is private
and unique to you.

59:42.970 --> 59:44.624
You face it alone.

59:47.932 --> 59:50.717
The light will reveal all.

59:51.500 --> 59:52.893
Follow it.

1:01:20.851 --> 1:01:22.113
I'’m sorry, Dad.

1:01:25.246 --> 1:01:26.639
I couldn'’t stop him.

1:01:40.653 --> 1:01:42.176
It'’s not your fault.

1:01:43.177 --> 1:01:44.265
You were just a kid.

1:01:48.269 --> 1:01:49.662
I couldn'’t save you.

1:01:50.968 --> 1:01:52.665
You saved yourself.

1:01:53.927 --> 1:01:56.147
That'’s the only thing
that mattered to me.

1:02:53.378 --> 1:02:54.945
Did I pass?

1:02:55.119 --> 1:02:58.513
This is more than a test
you pass or fail.

1:02:58.687 --> 1:03:02.039
It is a mirror
to reveal your weakness.

1:03:02.213 --> 1:03:08.393
Even if it
causes you more pain,
you must unburden yourself.

1:03:08.567 --> 1:03:12.658
It is the only way
to overcome the third challenge.

1:03:12.832 --> 1:03:14.486
And I assure you,

1:03:14.660 --> 1:03:17.619
this is not a challenge
you want to fail.

1:04:27.472 --> 1:04:29.256
Motion detectors
picked up activity in
our weapons research facility.

1:04:29.430 --> 1:04:30.692
Did you make an ID?

1:04:30.867 --> 1:04:32.433
He was masked.

1:04:40.441 --> 1:04:42.443
How did they get past the walls?

1:04:44.489 --> 1:04:45.882
Maybe they didn'’t.

1:05:19.002 --> 1:05:20.003
I miss something?

1:05:24.007 --> 1:05:26.226
I followed you
into the city.

1:05:27.053 --> 1:05:28.576
But you know that.

1:05:28.750 --> 1:05:29.795
Where did you go?

1:05:31.797 --> 1:05:34.582
You'’ve been looking for a reason
not to trust me from the start.

1:05:34.756 --> 1:05:37.324
You'’re an unknown.
That'’s dangerous.

1:05:41.415 --> 1:05:44.375
I think you can handle yourself.Dangerous to this clan.

1:05:45.724 --> 1:05:47.726
You don'’t know
what this place means to me.

1:05:47.900 --> 1:05:50.598
I owe the Arashikage everything.

1:05:50.772 --> 1:05:52.861
I never knew family
before I arrived here.

1:05:53.645 --> 1:05:55.560
Can you understand that?

1:06:10.444 --> 1:06:12.969
You want to know why
I'’ve been a ghost for so long?

1:06:18.235 --> 1:06:20.193
My father was murdered
when I was a kid.

1:06:21.803 --> 1:06:25.242
When I tried to find out why,
it was as if he didn'’t exist.

1:06:25.416 --> 1:06:27.766
False identities, false papers.

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:30.377
Everything about him was a lie.

1:06:33.467 --> 1:06:34.773
Even my own name.

1:06:42.302 --> 1:06:44.043
That'’s why
I couldn'’t find you.

1:06:46.524 --> 1:06:48.439
If I pass
the third challenge...

1:06:50.006 --> 1:06:51.964
I'’m Arashikage, right?

1:06:53.052 --> 1:06:54.619
If you pass.

1:06:55.707 --> 1:06:57.013
I have to pass.

1:07:00.146 --> 1:07:03.932
I'’ve done unforgivable things
I wish I could tell you,
but I can'’t.

1:07:05.456 --> 1:07:07.501
But if I could become
part of this family,

1:07:07.675 --> 1:07:08.894
be its protector...

1:07:11.114 --> 1:07:12.767
I think
that would make it right.

1:07:21.428 --> 1:07:23.430
Then empty your heart.

1:07:26.303 --> 1:07:28.174
Whatever you'’re hiding
in there,

1:07:28.348 --> 1:07:30.524
the challenge
will see right through it.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:40.926
I see that you have
a clouded mind.

1:07:41.100 --> 1:07:44.190
You live on both sides
of the mirror.

1:07:44.364 --> 1:07:47.715
Only you know whether
you are ready to take this test.

1:07:47.889 --> 1:07:50.457
Be certain
that you wish to proceed.

1:07:50.631 --> 1:07:52.807
Once the third challenge
begins,

1:07:52.981 --> 1:07:54.635
there is no turning back.

1:07:57.812 --> 1:07:59.075
I'’m sure.

1:08:00.641 --> 1:08:04.210
Those who pass are
accepted into the Arashikage.

1:08:04.384 --> 1:08:06.386
If you survive,
you will gain access

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:09.520
to our knowledge
and our power.

1:08:10.869 --> 1:08:14.742
But you must swear loyalty
to our clan.

1:08:14.916 --> 1:08:16.918
Do you accept
this condition?

1:08:19.095 --> 1:08:20.531
I do.

1:08:28.669 --> 1:08:30.280
What do I do
when I get down there?

1:08:30.454 --> 1:08:32.238
There is a particular tile.

1:08:32.412 --> 1:08:34.980
Step on it
and wait for judgment.

1:08:37.852 --> 1:08:38.984
Something funny?

1:08:39.550 --> 1:08:40.942
You will see,

1:08:41.117 --> 1:08:42.292
Snake.

1:10:01.980 --> 1:10:04.374
Giant anacondas
as old as time.

1:10:04.548 --> 1:10:06.985
They never harm
those who are pure of heart.

1:10:07.159 --> 1:10:08.769
What about everybody else?

1:11:02.997 --> 1:11:04.738
Empty your heart.

1:12:18.421 --> 1:12:19.422
Go!

1:12:23.251 --> 1:12:24.252
Go!

1:12:49.713 --> 1:12:52.542
She knows our rules.
She will be punished.

1:12:53.673 --> 1:12:55.849
Grandmother--You brought him among us.

1:12:56.023 --> 1:12:58.025
The fault
is not hers alone.

1:12:59.462 --> 1:13:00.463
No, Sen-san.

1:13:02.290 --> 1:13:03.988
The fault is mine.

1:13:04.902 --> 1:13:06.860
Explain yourself.

1:13:07.034 --> 1:13:09.907
The penalty of lying is death.

1:13:12.518 --> 1:13:14.041
We are all listening.

1:13:20.047 --> 1:13:21.527
My heart is not pure.

1:13:22.876 --> 1:13:24.269
I seek vengeance.

1:13:25.618 --> 1:13:27.098
My father
was murdered.

1:13:28.229 --> 1:13:30.362
I have dedicated my life

1:13:30.536 --> 1:13:32.408
to finding the man
who did it...

1:13:33.713 --> 1:13:35.106
and killing him.

1:13:40.894 --> 1:13:44.855
This is all I'’ve ever wanted.

1:13:51.209 --> 1:13:52.602
He speaks the truth.

1:13:54.604 --> 1:13:56.867
Your honesty
wins you your life,

1:13:57.737 --> 1:13:59.739
but not among
the Arashikage.

1:14:16.495 --> 1:14:17.670
Snake!

1:14:59.625 --> 1:15:01.018
You should have told me.

1:15:01.975 --> 1:15:04.021
We could have been brothers.

1:15:05.544 --> 1:15:07.285
I know I failed you.

1:15:08.765 --> 1:15:11.942
You are the only brother
I'’ve ever known.

1:15:12.116 --> 1:15:14.727
And I would pay you back
with my life if I had to.

1:16:08.259 --> 1:16:09.695
Keep it.

1:18:35.101 --> 1:18:37.625
It'’s safe.

1:20:14.635 --> 1:20:16.202
I was hoping
you wouldn'’t do that.

1:20:17.551 --> 1:20:18.944
Akiko.

1:20:20.250 --> 1:20:22.905
Still want to know
how I got my scar?

1:20:23.079 --> 1:20:24.820
From the last man I trusted.

1:20:25.951 --> 1:20:28.388
Trust is a hard thing to
come by these days.

1:20:31.957 --> 1:20:33.437
Time for you to learn a lesson.

1:21:11.431 --> 1:21:13.869
You have placed
the clan at risk.

1:21:14.957 --> 1:21:16.393
You must atone.

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:19.352
We will return
the Jewel...

1:21:22.051 --> 1:21:24.836
and bring you the head
of Snake Eyes.

1:21:48.077 --> 1:21:49.078
So?

1:21:49.861 --> 1:21:51.254
Do you have it?

1:21:52.559 --> 1:21:54.605
You'’re gonna start a war
with the Arashikage, aren'’t you?

1:21:54.779 --> 1:21:56.389
What do you care?

1:21:58.565 --> 1:22:02.134
Remember our deal,
and you will get
what I promised.

1:22:35.994 --> 1:22:37.735
This isn'’t my fight.

1:22:50.139 --> 1:22:51.140
Come here.

1:23:10.420 --> 1:23:11.682
Mmm.

1:23:16.948 --> 1:23:18.341
Please,

1:23:18.515 --> 1:23:20.212
enjoy your reward.

1:23:39.536 --> 1:23:42.495
You will get the Jewel
once I'’ve destroyed the clan.

1:24:45.341 --> 1:24:46.342
Who are you?

1:24:50.041 --> 1:24:51.434
You killed my dad.

1:24:54.611 --> 1:24:57.179
You'’re going to have to be
a little more specific.

1:24:58.005 --> 1:25:00.791
I killed a lot of people.

1:25:15.066 --> 1:25:16.111
Roll.

1:25:17.808 --> 1:25:19.375
Win, you live.

1:25:20.289 --> 1:25:21.986
Lose, you die.

1:25:25.990 --> 1:25:27.296
Roll!

1:25:28.601 --> 1:25:29.733
Roll!

1:25:33.215 --> 1:25:34.607
Snake eyes.

1:25:36.653 --> 1:25:37.958
You better think!

1:25:41.745 --> 1:25:44.443
Okay, okay. All right.

1:25:44.617 --> 1:25:47.620
Now I remember you.
You attacked me,
tried to save your dad.

1:25:47.794 --> 1:25:49.796
Why did you kill him?

1:25:49.970 --> 1:25:52.321
Cobra gives an order,
you don'’t question it.

1:26:04.898 --> 1:26:06.161
You'’re Cobra.

1:26:08.075 --> 1:26:09.338
I was.

1:26:10.643 --> 1:26:12.079
Until three weeks ago,

1:26:12.254 --> 1:26:15.300
when that bitch dragged me
off a chopper at gunpoint.

1:26:20.218 --> 1:26:24.266
You must be a big man for
the Baroness to hand me over.

1:26:29.880 --> 1:26:31.447
Let'’s go. Let'’s do this.

1:27:04.001 --> 1:27:06.003
I have to stop Kenta.

1:27:17.580 --> 1:27:18.711
There he is.

1:27:19.582 --> 1:27:20.844
Follow him.

1:27:33.683 --> 1:27:35.250
What'’s he doing?

1:27:35.424 --> 1:27:37.164
Looks like
he'’s heading back
to the castle.

1:27:55.531 --> 1:27:56.662
Let'’s go.

1:27:59.317 --> 1:28:01.450
I need backup!

1:28:22.340 --> 1:28:25.212
Did you see that?
Snake'’s fighting on our side.

1:28:49.498 --> 1:28:51.195
Tommy, listen to me.

1:28:51.369 --> 1:28:54.111
Kenta'’s got the Jewel
and is headed for the castle.

1:28:54.285 --> 1:28:55.504
Can you hear me?

1:28:55.678 --> 1:28:56.809
Tommy! Akiko!

1:28:56.983 --> 1:28:58.289
Shit!

1:29:29.581 --> 1:29:30.843
We have to keep you safe.

1:29:31.017 --> 1:29:32.671
Nothing matters
but the safety of the clan.

1:29:32.845 --> 1:29:34.064
You are the clan!

1:29:34.238 --> 1:29:36.153
I am nothing by myself.

1:30:48.181 --> 1:30:49.835
I guess the party started early.

1:31:13.337 --> 1:31:16.166
He needs help.He deserves to die.

1:33:07.886 --> 1:33:10.976
We have to stop Kenta.
He has the Jewel.

1:33:16.416 --> 1:33:18.462
This isn'’t over.

1:33:29.821 --> 1:33:32.607
Leave! Now!

1:34:09.078 --> 1:34:11.254
I am the Arashikage.

1:34:13.473 --> 1:34:15.214
This is a terrible idea.

1:34:48.247 --> 1:34:50.815
You have fought bravely.

1:34:52.208 --> 1:34:54.210
I give you my word,
your end will be swift
and painless.

1:34:54.384 --> 1:34:57.866
Very noble.
But the promise
is not yours to make.

1:35:01.826 --> 1:35:03.045
The Jewel.

1:35:03.219 --> 1:35:05.177
The clan is destroyed.

1:35:05.351 --> 1:35:07.353
We kept our side
of the bargain.

1:35:07.527 --> 1:35:09.399
I trust you'’ll keep yours.

1:35:15.187 --> 1:35:19.017
With this jewel,
Cobra will be invincible.

1:35:21.846 --> 1:35:23.413
Maybe I'’ll just keep it.

1:35:23.587 --> 1:35:25.154
No good deed, huh?

1:35:26.068 --> 1:35:27.199
Shut up.

1:35:27.373 --> 1:35:29.636
Cobra will annihilate you.

1:35:33.684 --> 1:35:36.905
You protect my grandmother.
I'’ll go after the Jewel.

1:35:39.603 --> 1:35:41.736
When you cast me out,

1:35:41.910 --> 1:35:45.435
I warned you
this day would come.

1:35:46.566 --> 1:35:47.611
Kneel.

1:35:51.006 --> 1:35:52.355
Very well, then.

1:35:54.879 --> 1:35:55.880
Die.

1:35:58.709 --> 1:36:00.972
We'’re under attack!
It'’s Tommy.

1:36:05.890 --> 1:36:06.891
Snake.

1:36:14.072 --> 1:36:16.683
You'’re in a tight spot, huh?I'’ve been in worse.

1:36:16.858 --> 1:36:19.077
Still, I'’d like to propose
a very temporary alliance.

1:36:19.251 --> 1:36:21.558
All right.
But when it'’s over, I walk.

1:36:21.732 --> 1:36:23.908
Not a chance,
but I'’ll give you
a head start.

1:36:46.278 --> 1:36:49.760
You'’re losing your touch.
I saw you a mile away.

1:36:51.457 --> 1:36:52.850
Sure you did.

1:36:53.024 --> 1:36:55.679
Good of you
to join us, Tommy-san.

1:36:55.853 --> 1:36:57.420
And just in time.

1:36:58.508 --> 1:37:00.118
I count 20 men.

1:37:00.989 --> 1:37:01.903
Heavy odds.

1:37:02.077 --> 1:37:03.774
Yeah. For them.

1:37:31.628 --> 1:37:33.064
Snake Eyes,

1:37:33.238 --> 1:37:36.502
betray our trust again,
I'’ll kill you myself.

1:37:38.156 --> 1:37:39.592
What is she doing here?

1:37:39.766 --> 1:37:42.639
Let'’s just say our goals
are temporarily aligned.

1:37:45.990 --> 1:37:47.252
Just for tonight.

1:38:28.859 --> 1:38:29.991
They'’re mine.

1:40:05.216 --> 1:40:06.478
Yo, Joe.

1:40:13.616 --> 1:40:15.835
Hmm.Mm-hmm.

1:40:45.517 --> 1:40:46.605
Fuck this.

1:41:08.279 --> 1:41:11.978
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

1:41:51.801 --> 1:41:53.063
Tommy!

1:42:03.117 --> 1:42:05.336
Tommy-san, no! Tommy-san!

1:42:26.618 --> 1:42:28.011
Kenta'’s gone.

1:42:30.405 --> 1:42:31.406
Where'’s Snake?

1:43:08.269 --> 1:43:09.748
Just stay down.

1:43:39.256 --> 1:43:40.997
Abandon ego.

1:43:44.087 --> 1:43:46.132
Practice selflessness.

1:43:49.223 --> 1:43:51.877
Strike with honor.

1:45:08.563 --> 1:45:10.304
This is where you die.

1:46:44.398 --> 1:46:46.312
The Jewel of the Sun
is secure.

1:46:53.929 --> 1:46:55.887
And it always will be.

1:46:57.236 --> 1:46:59.630
At least
for another generation.

1:47:04.505 --> 1:47:08.117
I will be the last of our family
to lead the Arashikage.

1:47:10.946 --> 1:47:12.251
But Sen-sama--

1:47:15.733 --> 1:47:17.648
I had no choice.

1:47:20.172 --> 1:47:23.437
I only used the Jewel
to defend our people.

1:47:24.350 --> 1:47:26.091
There is always a choice.

1:47:26.265 --> 1:47:29.704
Our clan swore an oath
to never use the Jewel,

1:47:29.878 --> 1:47:31.445
only to protect it.

1:47:33.098 --> 1:47:34.404
You can never...

1:47:36.885 --> 1:47:37.973
lead the clan.

1:47:38.147 --> 1:47:39.104
With respect--

1:47:39.278 --> 1:47:41.150
Remember your vows,
Tommy,

1:47:41.324 --> 1:47:43.892
to forever serve the clan
in any capacity.

1:47:44.066 --> 1:47:45.328
"Serve"?

1:47:50.420 --> 1:47:51.682
Serve?

1:47:54.729 --> 1:47:59.516
I have given my life
to this clan!

1:47:59.690 --> 1:48:01.953
I have sacrificed
everything!

1:48:02.127 --> 1:48:03.172
Tommy.

1:48:03.999 --> 1:48:06.697
It is my blood right!

1:48:17.447 --> 1:48:21.582
You offered me your life.

1:48:25.803 --> 1:48:27.805
Next time we meet...

1:48:29.503 --> 1:48:32.680
I will take it.

1:48:36.292 --> 1:48:37.946
Tomisaburo, wait.

1:48:40.470 --> 1:48:43.038
You will always
be a part of this family.

1:49:04.538 --> 1:49:06.017
I serve no one.

1:49:43.751 --> 1:49:46.362
I'’m going after Tommy.I had a feeling you might.

1:49:47.363 --> 1:49:48.799
Are you sure that'’s wise?

1:49:48.973 --> 1:49:51.193
In his state,
who knows what he might do?

1:49:51.367 --> 1:49:53.195
That'’s why
I have to find him.

1:49:54.500 --> 1:49:56.590
This is all my fault.

1:49:56.764 --> 1:49:58.896
I have to do
everything I can
to make it right.

1:50:00.550 --> 1:50:03.161
Well, this might be useful.

1:50:16.348 --> 1:50:18.089
Be careful.

1:50:20.962 --> 1:50:22.050
Excuse me.

1:50:22.224 --> 1:50:24.356
My commander,
General Joe Colton,

1:50:24.530 --> 1:50:26.620
wanted to share this
with you.

1:50:48.250 --> 1:50:49.643
I don'’t understand.

1:50:49.817 --> 1:50:52.471
Your father was one of us.
A Joe.

1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:56.084
He was a Joe?

1:50:56.258 --> 1:50:58.782
You'’ll find no record
of you in there.

1:50:58.956 --> 1:51:01.132
He kept you off the grid
to protect you.

1:51:02.830 --> 1:51:04.179
So why was he killed?

1:51:04.353 --> 1:51:06.442
Your father infiltrated
a Cobra cell.

1:51:06.616 --> 1:51:08.879
But they found out.

1:51:09.053 --> 1:51:11.403
By the time we got there,
he was dead and you were gone.

1:51:13.318 --> 1:51:16.670
But you should know
the intel he provided
saved thousands of lives.

1:51:18.410 --> 1:51:20.021
At the cost of his own.

1:51:20.195 --> 1:51:21.631
It was a price
he was willing to pay

1:51:21.805 --> 1:51:24.329
to make the world a safer place
for the rest of us.

1:51:24.503 --> 1:51:26.375
Safer for his son.

1:51:28.812 --> 1:51:31.075
He left some big shoes
to fill, your dad.

1:51:33.643 --> 1:51:36.559
It hasn'’t been easy finding
the right person to fill them.

1:51:36.733 --> 1:51:40.302
So you'’re saying
I could be a Joe?

1:51:40.476 --> 1:51:41.956
Anything'’s possible.

1:51:44.523 --> 1:51:46.874
We all make mistakes.

1:51:47.048 --> 1:51:49.311
It'’s what we do next
that really matters.

1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:54.359
When you'’re ready,
Akiko knows where to find us.

1:52:01.410 --> 1:52:03.455
There'’s something
I need to do first.

1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:06.937
Let'’s find Tommy
and bring him home.

1:52:53.288 --> 1:52:55.377
Something to drink
before takeoff?

1:53:03.951 --> 1:53:05.604
I'’m not here to kill you.

1:53:17.399 --> 1:53:18.966
I came to make you an offer.

1:53:24.275 --> 1:53:27.409
You'’ve lost an army, Tommy.

1:53:30.673 --> 1:53:32.283
But I can get you a better one.

1:53:40.465 --> 1:53:41.640
Storm Shadow.

1:53:47.646 --> 1:53:50.519
Call me Storm Shadow.
