00:01.960 --> 00:04.546
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:38.580
( both laughing )

00:42.209 --> 00:43.961
It's bigger
than I thought.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.379
( both laugh )

00:52.886 --> 00:56.640
Jimmy:
<i>This is nice. This is nice.
This is fuckin' nice.</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:00.435
This is nice.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.812
( shaking spray paint can )

01:03.522 --> 01:04.940
<i>Oh, man.</i>

01:08.694 --> 01:10.320
‐ <i>G‐Bo.</i>
‐ Yeah?

01:12.155 --> 01:14.116
‐ ( laughs )
‐ How ya doin', Pop?

01:15.367 --> 01:17.619
<i>Oh, man.</i>

01:17.703 --> 01:19.329
<i>Now we're in room 104.</i>

01:20.455 --> 01:22.833
‐ What a trip.
‐ Great set.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.626
What a trip.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.462
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:36.430
Oh, look at this.
This is good stuff here too.
Look at this, G‐Bo.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.558
Oh, my God. They got
all kinds of stuff over here.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.977
There's a lot of dynamics
with this room.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.860
Oh, G‐Bo! Look at this.
Look at this.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.236
( pats box spring )

01:51.320 --> 01:53.405
‐ Yeah, that's good.
‐ Perfect.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.407
It's got like
a canvas texture to it.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.783
Perfect.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.910
Jimmy:
<i>If you had told me
a year ago,</i>

01:58.994 --> 02:00.787
where we were
and where we are,

02:00.871 --> 02:04.249
that this is the deal,
I would've never believed it.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.543
‐ <i>OK, so I have a thought.</i>
‐ What?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.670
I think if we flip
these babies around

02:08.754 --> 02:11.423
and throw‐‐
get our paint on 'em,
they're gonna dry,

02:11.506 --> 02:13.508
and then we can
flip 'em back around

02:13.592 --> 02:16.386
and put our‐‐ our strings on
while they're kinda drying.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.930
'Cause at some point
I'm gonna put it on the wall.

02:19.014 --> 02:19.973
OK.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.852
These are nice and light,
this is perfect.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.605
<i>‐ The box springs are light.
‐ They're like a canvas,</i>

02:26.688 --> 02:29.358
<i>so the objective
is to use the box springs</i>

02:29.441 --> 02:31.735
so we have
two separate pieces‐‐

02:31.818 --> 02:33.987
Gianni Arone,
Jimmy Ray Flynn‐‐

02:34.071 --> 02:36.657
and then everything else
is up for grabs.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.828
Yeah, nice.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.289
<i>Uh, you're not
gonna hit the edges?</i>

02:44.373 --> 02:45.874
I'm just going...

02:45.957 --> 02:48.752
‐ Hit those edges.
‐ You hit those edges.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.546
‐ OK.
‐ I didn't mean it for real.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.548
( laughs )

02:55.217 --> 02:56.093
‐ Hey.
‐ What?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.594
You said I could hit the edges.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.805
‐ No, leave it.
‐ No, baby, come on.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.099
‐ They gotta have the balance.
‐ <i>No, they don't.</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:04.643
‐ No, you don't.
‐ Just let me finish it.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.186
All right.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.693
Yeah, I'm gonna have to wait
till this dries.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.445
Yeah, it's gotta
dry a little bit.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.531
Do you wanna do like...

03:17.614 --> 03:19.157
a lamp, or you want
to do something else?

03:19.241 --> 03:21.576
Because I'm gonna be doing
some collage stuff.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.668
Gianni:
<i>I'm not an artist</i>

03:29.751 --> 03:31.336
who is formally trained

03:31.420 --> 03:33.922
<i>and who is doing oils</i>

03:34.005 --> 03:36.675
<i>and, like, rendering
lifelike drawings.</i>

03:36.758 --> 03:39.177
<i>I just like makin'.</i>

03:39.261 --> 03:41.555
Jimmy:
<i>Looks good.</i>

03:41.638 --> 03:45.350
Did I spell "experiencing"
right? Dad?

03:45.434 --> 03:47.686
Oh, shit. Is this, like,
a spelling thing?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.813
‐ I don't know.
‐ "Experien..."

03:49.896 --> 03:51.523
<i>Can't tell.
I can't remember.</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:53.734
Spelling's not my thing.

03:53.817 --> 03:58.321
I think so.
Jimi Hendrix Experience.
Let's see...

03:58.405 --> 04:00.615
‐ I don't know.
‐ Yeah, it's fine.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.034
Jimmy:
<i>I work fast
and in the moment,</i>

04:03.118 --> 04:05.162
<i>I stay in the process.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:07.080
<i>( Jimmy laughing )</i>

04:07.164 --> 04:09.666
<i>I like that. I like
when you do that shit.</i>

04:09.750 --> 04:10.959
That's, like, my favorite,

04:11.042 --> 04:12.878
when you start
spoofing on heads.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.589
Gianni:
<i>I just like getting into it,</i>

04:15.672 --> 04:17.716
<i>and I love installations.</i>

04:17.799 --> 04:21.052
So to be able to use
the parameters of the room...

04:21.136 --> 04:23.472
<i>because it's an installation.</i>

04:24.931 --> 04:28.393
I like that. That's great.
We gotta chop that wall up.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.228
<i>That's a piece.</i>

04:30.312 --> 04:32.939
<i>Jimmy:
I am his biggest fan.
I'm his number‐‐</i>

04:33.023 --> 04:35.358
I love a lot of artists,
but he's‐‐ he's the best.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.570
Gianni, you picked out
some really good things.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.697
This is great.
It's got tape on it, too.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.907
Yeah, that's
the one I liked.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.950
‐ You keep this one.
‐ No, use it.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.202
‐ Keep it.
‐ Use it.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.620
OK.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.330
Jimmy:
<i>He kinda like inspired me.</i>

04:48.413 --> 04:51.917
<i>We had talked
about collaborating
for a long time,</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:54.169
<i>but there's something
that happened this year</i>

04:54.252 --> 04:57.214
<i>with Gianni dealing with his‐‐</i>

04:57.297 --> 04:58.590
I call it "mental wellness,"

04:58.673 --> 05:00.967
that allowed it to flow

05:01.051 --> 05:02.385
in a way that
didn't feel forced.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.554
<i>I said, "Hey, man,
you wanna do this?"</i>

05:04.638 --> 05:07.682
<i>"Yeah, let's do it."
We started doing it.</i>

05:09.226 --> 05:11.144
I like this, G‐Bo.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.480
I like the two ones.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.482
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.858
I like it.

05:16.942 --> 05:20.070
This is like
my favorite material.
Yeah.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.372
Jimmy:
<i>Can you get out of that light
for a second, please?</i>

05:31.540 --> 05:34.125
‐ Yeah, you.
‐ ( camera clicks )

05:34.209 --> 05:36.795
Tell me that
doesn't look fucking cool.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.588
Yeah.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.507
Gianni:
<i>I know a lot of my friends</i>

05:40.590 --> 05:42.884
<i>have fractured relationships
with their dads.</i>

05:49.558 --> 05:51.226
Younger Jimmy:
<i>My buddies.</i>

05:53.812 --> 05:55.772
Say, "Hi, Mom."

05:55.856 --> 05:59.359
Gianni:
<i>As a little kid, I just
remember a present father.</i>

06:03.238 --> 06:05.282
<i>He just created, like,</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:07.826
<i>a nurturing environment
for creativity.</i>

06:07.909 --> 06:10.829
<i>He would put on,
like, Tracy Chapman and music</i>

06:10.912 --> 06:13.873
<i>and we would get pots and pans
and play the drums.</i>

06:13.957 --> 06:16.167
Jimmy:
<i>Happy birthday.
I'm gonna go now.</i>

06:16.251 --> 06:18.169
I want you to give me a kiss.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.671
( kiss )

06:19.754 --> 06:23.633
<i>And he's grown into
my best friend.</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:25.927
<i>It wasn't always like that.</i>

06:28.263 --> 06:30.682
Jimmy:
<i>Ahh, yeah,</i>

06:30.765 --> 06:33.268
it really didn't start to happen
until the friggin'‐‐

06:33.351 --> 06:35.478
started with
the drugs and alcohol.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.856
I mean, that's when it just
became a whole 'nother animal.

06:37.939 --> 06:43.028
That's when it started to be
this clear kind of... uh‐oh.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.362
( paint can rattling )

06:44.446 --> 06:46.364
You gotta be careful
with the spray paint, though.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.450
‐ I know.
‐ All right.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.705
Gianni:
<i>Yeah, it was
shortly after high school</i>

06:53.788 --> 06:56.875
<i>when I just opened up
to something and I just</i>

06:56.958 --> 06:58.877
( snaps fingers )
went in. I mean,

06:58.960 --> 07:02.255
you go from smokin' weed
after high school

07:02.339 --> 07:03.590
to next year doin' meth,

07:03.673 --> 07:06.176
‐ like smokin' crystal meth,
‐ Ohh.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.886
‐ which is just like a‐‐
‐ The fuckin' worst.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.096
<i>Which is like a epidemic
of a drug,</i>

07:10.180 --> 07:13.975
<i>and took me to places
I thought I'd never go to</i>

07:14.059 --> 07:16.770
emotionally, physically,

07:16.853 --> 07:19.189
mentally, spiritually,
psychologically.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.982
It'll steal your friggin' soul.
I don't give a shit,

07:21.066 --> 07:22.651
I hear him say the word "meth,"

07:22.734 --> 07:25.570
and I get like, "I'm goin'
to another place now,"

07:25.654 --> 07:28.114
'cause I just‐‐
it's, like, <i>evil.</i>

07:29.824 --> 07:32.452
Gianni:
<i>Not only did I do meth,
but I did LSD,</i>

07:32.535 --> 07:33.703
<i>I did mushrooms,
I smoked weed.</i>

07:33.787 --> 07:35.622
<i>I smoked heroin once.</i>

07:35.705 --> 07:36.998
<i>I went down
the pipeline of,</i>

07:37.082 --> 07:39.292
"What does it do?
How does it affect me?

07:39.376 --> 07:40.377
Let's try it."

07:42.504 --> 07:45.423
<i>I was microdosing LSD for,
like, a year straight.</i>

07:45.507 --> 07:50.178
<i>And, like, that has a huge
effect on your brain chemistry,</i>

07:50.261 --> 07:53.014
and I started hearing voices.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.984
I'm gonna start my collaging.
I'm gonna collage over here.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.069
I'm gonna work over here.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.279
<i>You know, it's interesting
we're doing this now,</i>

08:08.363 --> 08:11.199
we're literally coming up
on the year anniversary.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.121
Let me just back it up
a second.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.123
Younger Jimmy:
<i>Make a little wish, OK?</i>

08:18.206 --> 08:20.625
<i>The night Gianni was born,
I remember him coming out</i>

08:20.709 --> 08:23.128
<i>and watching the life
come into his body.</i>

08:23.211 --> 08:25.213
<i>He just looked at me.
It was surreal.</i>

08:26.297 --> 08:30.802
Cut to December fifth...

08:30.885 --> 08:32.887
of last year.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.849
He came to my house

08:35.932 --> 08:38.810
in a full‐blown
psychotic episode.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.770
I didn't know
who the fuck he was.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.777
<i>We had this thing
literally in the backyard,</i>

08:47.861 --> 08:50.113
<i>we were sitting there,
we were talking
across from each other,</i>

08:50.196 --> 08:51.990
<i>and he was like
in a full‐blown episode.</i>

08:52.073 --> 08:53.408
<i>At one point he said to me,</i>

08:53.491 --> 08:55.535
"Don't worry,
I'm not gonna kill you."

08:55.618 --> 08:57.996
And I thought,
"Is this motherfucker
thinkin' about killin' me?"

08:58.079 --> 09:00.290
<i>And I was petrified.</i>

09:00.373 --> 09:02.542
<i>I said, "Gianni,
I'm gonna go in the house
and get some water."</i>

09:02.625 --> 09:04.294
I went in the house
and I called the cops.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.921
And I said, "You gotta come
and get my son."

09:09.132 --> 09:10.258
<i>Ahh...</i>

09:10.341 --> 09:12.927
All I know is, it was like

09:13.011 --> 09:15.930
the hardest thing
I've ever had to do in my life.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.522
<i>The cops come,
Gianni got in the car</i>

09:24.606 --> 09:26.357
<i>and, you know,
they took him</i>

09:26.441 --> 09:28.026
to the fucking psych unit
and shit,

09:28.109 --> 09:30.028
and we went there,
first night I go in,

09:30.111 --> 09:32.697
<i>he's like fuckin'
doing cartwheels</i>

09:32.781 --> 09:34.032
<i>or backflips in the thing,</i>

09:34.115 --> 09:35.533
<i>he's head‐butting me,</i>

09:35.617 --> 09:37.494
<i>he's really angry,
really agitated.</i>

09:37.577 --> 09:38.995
<i>And then we found out</i>

09:39.079 --> 09:41.623
<i>that he's got
a dual diagnosis.</i>

09:41.706 --> 09:45.293
Couple that with the addiction‐‐
it's a mental illness.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.296
So now you're dealing with
a whole 'nother thing.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.968
‐ How ya doin', G?
‐ Eh.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.221
Yeah, it's...

09:56.304 --> 09:59.390
‐ It's all over the place.
‐ Yeah.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.851
All right, well,
it's your thing, baby.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.653
Let's put a whole series
together...

10:11.736 --> 10:14.489
Gianni:
<i>I've been diagnosed
bipolar I and II,</i>

10:14.572 --> 10:16.699
<i>schizoaffective,
schizophrenic.</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:19.702
<i>I don't know
if my mental illness was
caused from my drug use‐‐</i>

10:19.786 --> 10:21.913
Is it chemically induced
mental illness,

10:21.996 --> 10:23.832
or is actually something
that's biological?

10:23.915 --> 10:25.333
Or something
that onset later?

10:27.001 --> 10:28.920
<i>They would diagnose me,</i>

10:29.003 --> 10:30.922
<i>and I'd do the meds
for a little bit,</i>

10:31.005 --> 10:33.174
<i>then I'd take myself off 'em
because I was just like,</i>

10:33.258 --> 10:35.802
<i>I'm an alcoholic
and I'm an addict,</i>

10:35.885 --> 10:37.262
<i>and I like feeling high,</i>

10:37.345 --> 10:40.598
and when I'm unmedicated
and I go into mania,

10:40.682 --> 10:42.392
<i>I feel high from that.</i>

10:45.395 --> 10:46.980
I like feeling a little off,

10:47.063 --> 10:48.565
I like feeling
a little weird,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.942
I like feeling a little askew

10:51.025 --> 10:54.195
<i>and not totally
bolted to the ground.</i>

10:57.240 --> 10:59.117
Can you throw me
one of those rags real quick?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.368
<i>Like the big hand?</i>

11:02.078 --> 11:04.622
It's a little too big
for my taste, but‐‐

11:04.706 --> 11:06.374
Can you throw me
one of those rags, please?

11:08.459 --> 11:10.587
Maybe it is
too big of a hand.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.717
Wanna have a seat?
Wanna sit down?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.552
G‐Bo.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.262
Wanna sit down?

11:23.183 --> 11:26.477
I don't like it at all
right now.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.314
There's no question
in my mind
you're gonna get there.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.524
No, I know, I'm not
worried about getting there.

11:31.608 --> 11:35.570
You jumped in,
the paint was still wet...

11:35.653 --> 11:38.031
‐ You know what I mean?
‐ Looks like a big chicken.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.908
<i>I don't see a chicken
at all.</i>

11:39.991 --> 11:41.993
<i>I just see like
a fuckin'...</i>

11:42.076 --> 11:44.495
‐ A blob.
‐ I don't see a blob,

11:44.579 --> 11:47.916
I just see a very exaggerated,
grotesque...

11:47.999 --> 11:50.585
If I were you,
one of the things I would do is,

11:50.668 --> 11:54.839
I would hit your canvas
so there's kind of
a little bit more white to it,

11:54.923 --> 11:58.301
and then as you go over it,
the other things will pop out.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.011
‐ Yeah, I agree.
‐ Right?

12:00.094 --> 12:01.471
So just hit it again.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.976
What are you doin'?
Why don't you hit it
with the roller?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.603
<i>'Cause I don't like
the roller.</i>

12:08.686 --> 12:12.899
Ohh, Gianni,
the paint's gonna
take forever to dry.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.693
Ohh.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.905
He's not fuckin' listenin'
to me.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.825
<i>The way you're doing that,
man, it's gonna take</i>

12:22.909 --> 12:24.786
a long time to dry.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.124
These are lessons
that I was supposed to learn

12:30.208 --> 12:32.543
about, like, backin' off,

12:32.627 --> 12:34.921
not micromanaging.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.258
<i>Yeah, man,
I would just hit that.</i>

12:38.341 --> 12:39.842
<i>Hit the edge too.</i>

12:40.969 --> 12:42.303
<i>Yeah, there you go,
brother.</i>

12:44.097 --> 12:45.807
Yeah, man, that's much better.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.146
Gianni:
<i>For me, being born
into a human body</i>

12:52.230 --> 12:55.233
on planet Earth
didn't make sense to me.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.568
<i>I'm like, what am I‐‐
what is this?</i>

12:57.652 --> 13:00.863
<i>What's this night/day,
love/hate, good/bad,</i>

13:00.947 --> 13:03.449
<i>all this polarity,
all this separation?</i>

13:03.533 --> 13:06.661
<i>This doesn't make sense
to my inherent nature
and my inherent being</i>

13:06.744 --> 13:10.540
<i>of oneness and completeness
and, like, a unified whole.</i>

13:10.623 --> 13:13.584
<i>I feel fractured and separated
and alone and weird,</i>

13:13.668 --> 13:17.755
and I've always been fascinated
with the moment of death,

13:17.839 --> 13:21.467
<i>and so I...</i>

13:21.551 --> 13:24.095
wanted to meet death
a couple times on my own sword.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.889
Maybe I'll just do
a big horse on it.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.355
<i>For me, I had...</i>

13:34.439 --> 13:37.025
<i>two attempts on my life,</i>

13:37.108 --> 13:39.944
<i>one was when I was younger,</i>

13:40.028 --> 13:42.780
<i>and then the last one
was more intentional.</i>

13:42.864 --> 13:44.657
Gonna wait
for it to dry.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.452
I had an episode
that I can only describe

13:47.535 --> 13:49.454
as losing the letters
and the numbers.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.415
<i>I couldn't articulate myself,
and therefore,</i>

13:52.498 --> 13:54.459
<i>when I came out
of the psychosis</i>

13:54.542 --> 13:55.793
<i>I couldn't relate to anyone.</i>

13:55.877 --> 13:58.588
<i>And I created this rig,</i>

13:58.671 --> 14:01.632
<i>and I was about
to turn on the switch,</i>

14:01.716 --> 14:03.384
and then there was
a knock on my door,

14:03.468 --> 14:07.013
and my ex‐girlfriend Sunshine
knocked on‐‐ opened the door

14:07.096 --> 14:10.475
and saved my life,
called my dad.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.518
Jimmy:
<i>As he's telling you
he's whatever,</i>

14:12.602 --> 14:14.395
I have to respect
what he's saying,

14:14.479 --> 14:15.813
'cause it's real for him.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.941
There was a point
when he was either

14:19.025 --> 14:21.069
in the hospital
or just getting out,

14:21.152 --> 14:23.613
I said, "You know something?
I will talk to you,

14:23.696 --> 14:25.239
but I won't talk
to your psychosis."

14:25.323 --> 14:28.743
<i>So for him
to tell you this story,</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:30.953
<i>and for me to listen to it,
whatever,</i>

14:31.037 --> 14:32.246
<i>I have to remind myself</i>

14:32.330 --> 14:33.956
they're very real for him.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.125
I don't relate to it,
you know?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.794
I mean, I don't fuckin'
relate to it,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.796
but it's real for him,
so I gotta respect it.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.506
Yeah. Well.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.217
‐ A horse.
‐ Yeah.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.885
( both laugh )

14:46.844 --> 14:48.221
Gianni: <i>Yeah,</i>

14:48.304 --> 14:51.224
today I want to live,
like, uh,

14:51.307 --> 14:53.768
<i>when I had those
suicide attempts,</i>

14:53.851 --> 14:55.686
<i>I didn't feel like</i>

14:55.770 --> 14:57.939
<i>this life that I'm living today
was possible</i>

14:58.022 --> 15:00.817
<i>or even on my radar,
so more will be revealed</i>

15:00.900 --> 15:03.111
<i>if you stick around.</i>

15:06.030 --> 15:08.199
Today, like,
I like peace of mind.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.077
<i>For the most part if someone
asks me how I'm doing,</i>

15:11.160 --> 15:13.955
<i>it's like, not too high,
not too low,</i>

15:14.038 --> 15:16.624
<i>not a lot going on upstairs,
it's just quiet.</i>

15:16.707 --> 15:19.377
<i>This is the first time
in my life I've felt like that,</i>

15:19.460 --> 15:21.420
<i>but it's two components:</i>

15:21.504 --> 15:24.132
<i>being sober
and being med‐compliant.</i>

15:24.215 --> 15:26.884
You got so much friggin' paint
on it. ( laughs )

15:26.968 --> 15:29.387
You got a ton of paint
on this, Gianni.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.389
‐ Yeah.
‐ Ohh.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.141
Jimmy:
<i>I myself had a‐‐</i>

15:33.224 --> 15:35.101
I don't want to call it
a suicide attempt,

15:35.184 --> 15:36.853
but I ended up in a 72‐hour hold
in a psych unit

15:36.936 --> 15:41.274
back in whatever year,
it was 1989, '90.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.235
<i>Gianni's mom and I
were going through</i>

15:44.318 --> 15:47.905
<i>a really hard time
and we split up,</i>

15:47.989 --> 15:50.074
<i>and I don't want
to get into details,</i>

15:50.158 --> 15:52.410
<i>but I never forget
this friggin' guy</i>

15:52.493 --> 15:55.079
<i>sittin' across from me
and saying,</i>

15:55.163 --> 15:58.332
"You realize you're never gonna
see your kids again, right?"

15:58.416 --> 16:00.543
And it was like, boom.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.796
Sound. Be ready.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.715
( power tool whirs )

16:05.798 --> 16:08.593
<i>I'm from that generation of men</i>

16:08.676 --> 16:09.927
<i>where you didn't go to therapy.</i>

16:10.011 --> 16:12.305
<i>When you got
into those places,</i>

16:12.388 --> 16:14.140
<i>you just friggin'
toughed it out.</i>

16:14.223 --> 16:16.559
But you know what?
It doesn't always work that way.

16:16.642 --> 16:21.272
When you're in crisis,
when you're in that state,

16:21.355 --> 16:23.858
you have to find a way
to ask for help.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.903
You have to find a way
to get yourself into

16:26.986 --> 16:29.280
a safe environment
with professionals,

16:29.363 --> 16:32.742
and there's people out there
that will help you

16:32.825 --> 16:35.036
take one foot
in front of the other.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.245
Yeah, it takes
a lot of courage.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.580
It takes guts.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.582
<i>And on some level
I have a lot of guilt,</i>

16:39.665 --> 16:41.459
<i>and I think sometimes
my behavior</i>

16:41.542 --> 16:44.253
<i>in what I did at that time,</i>

16:44.337 --> 16:45.671
<i>when I hurt myself‐‐</i>

16:45.755 --> 16:47.465
<i>Gianni was like
seven years old.</i>

16:47.548 --> 16:50.551
<i>I made mistakes, man,
I did some things,</i>

16:50.635 --> 16:52.595
<i>and I can't take
any of it back,</i>

16:52.678 --> 16:54.805
<i>but I realize,
you know what,</i>

16:54.889 --> 16:58.059
<i>it's just part of
what's happened in my life.</i>

17:01.145 --> 17:04.815
Gianni:
Oh, yeah, man, that looks good!

17:04.899 --> 17:06.817
That's dope.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.069
Fuck yeah.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.154
What do you think? G‐Bo.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.614
Oh, yeah, dude.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.494
I like the way
that hangs and shit.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.787
<i>‐ You like that?
‐ Yeah, man.</i>

17:17.870 --> 17:19.372
Jimmy:
<i>Looks pretty good.</i>

17:19.455 --> 17:23.626
I'm faced with a little bit
of a decision.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.170
Revolver Head?

17:26.254 --> 17:28.589
Gianni:
<i>No Revolver Head, no.</i>

17:28.673 --> 17:30.967
<i>See how the Grotjahn looks.</i>

17:33.594 --> 17:35.221
I love this fucking guy.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.932
I'm not sure
if that's gonna work.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.725
‐ There's too much color.
‐ Yeah.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.603
Ahh.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.397
I don't think
that's gonna work.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.774
‐ I like the donut.
‐ I like the donut too.

17:46.857 --> 17:51.571
Yeah, this is‐‐ this is not
gonna work like that.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.868
Gianni:
<i>For me, the mainstay has been
this mantra I've had</i>

17:57.952 --> 18:00.538
which is "Process is king."
And I find that, like,

18:00.621 --> 18:02.206
<i>in the moment of creating,</i>

18:02.290 --> 18:04.166
<i>no matter what
your mental state is,</i>

18:04.250 --> 18:06.919
<i>there's some magical
machination</i>

18:07.003 --> 18:09.422
<i>that happens in the moment
of doing something.</i>

18:09.505 --> 18:11.424
<i>Whether you're hitting the keys
on the piano,</i>

18:11.507 --> 18:13.426
<i>whether you're a dancer and
you're in the moment of flight,</i>

18:13.509 --> 18:15.720
<i>whether you're hitting
the canvas for the first time,</i>

18:15.803 --> 18:17.888
<i>and it's just
that movement of the brush</i>

18:17.972 --> 18:19.432
on the canvas.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.559
In that moment,
that's where it is,

18:21.642 --> 18:22.935
that's where it's at.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.022
Is that a Christmas tree?

18:26.105 --> 18:29.358
These weird little trees
I've been drawing lately...

18:29.442 --> 18:31.319
that bring me joy.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.904
Gianni:
<i>No matter what my state is,</i>

18:33.988 --> 18:35.573
<i>I can go to that
and have that</i>

18:35.656 --> 18:37.199
as my, like‐‐ phtt!‐‐

18:37.283 --> 18:38.909
centered, boom,
know what to do.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.870
<i>That's the gratifying thing,</i>

18:40.953 --> 18:42.413
<i>that's why I do art.</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:45.207
<i>There's restraint
and pause</i>

18:45.291 --> 18:46.709
<i>and peace now,</i>

18:46.792 --> 18:48.794
<i>where I can go to a work,</i>

18:48.878 --> 18:50.463
<i>work on it,</i>

18:50.546 --> 18:53.007
<i>feel that it's OK
to stop there,</i>

18:53.090 --> 18:55.509
<i>just be like,
"OK, we're good."</i>

18:56.677 --> 18:58.179
( sighs )

19:01.182 --> 19:03.184
<i>I kinda like
where mine's at
right now.</i>

19:03.267 --> 19:05.269
You gonna leave it there?
It's done?

19:05.353 --> 19:06.354
Kinda. Yeah. For now.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.356
Jimmy:
<i>What about the head?</i>

19:08.439 --> 19:10.941
‐ I like it like that.
‐ Really?

19:11.025 --> 19:12.777
I just like the silhouette
of the head.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.154
I don't want to put eyes on it
or anything.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.741
I got the good jawline
on the horse head.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.953
Gianni:
<i>Last year around this time,
like, I was scared,</i>

19:23.037 --> 19:26.374
<i>I thought I wouldn't
be able to do art again,
but you just do art.</i>

19:26.457 --> 19:29.293
I did art about
not being able
to do art again.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.879
I did a piece of art
'cause I was frustrated

19:31.962 --> 19:34.632
'cause it didn't feel right,
but I still did it.

19:34.715 --> 19:38.552
And now I kinda like the piece,
looking at it a year later.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.763
<i>But in the time,
I was just so angry</i>

19:40.846 --> 19:42.973
<i>I just felt like,
"This is foreign to me,</i>

19:43.057 --> 19:45.226
<i>I don't know what to do,"
but you persist,</i>

19:45.309 --> 19:48.062
<i>you continue to do your craft
a little bit each day.</i>

19:48.145 --> 19:50.564
<i>And if you really love it,
you're gonna be
inherently consistent</i>

19:50.648 --> 19:52.525
because you're gonna
want to do it each day.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.694
<i>And the results are gonna vary,</i>

19:54.777 --> 19:57.738
<i>but process is king‐‐
stay in the process.</i>

19:57.822 --> 19:59.240
<i>Stay in the process.</i>

19:59.323 --> 20:01.992
Both:
Creativity doesn't know
what time it is.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.036
That's why we want
to sleep here.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.288
<i>I get up
in the middle of the night
and work on a collage</i>

20:06.372 --> 20:08.874
<i>'cause creativity
doesn't know what time it is.</i>

20:32.773 --> 20:34.692
‐ ( both laugh )
‐ Go ahead, hit it.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.944
‐ I did.
‐ No, hit it again if you want.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.989
<i>I know you're dying
to make a mark on it.
Go ahead.</i>

20:40.072 --> 20:42.575
Gianni:
<i>These are pretty singular,</i>

20:42.658 --> 20:44.535
but he put on this
"Sweet Dreams" last night...

20:44.618 --> 20:46.954
<i>Because it was on the wall.</i>

20:47.037 --> 20:48.414
and I was like,
"That's awesome."

20:48.497 --> 20:50.040
Somebody in the crew
was kind enough

20:50.124 --> 20:51.584
to put "Sweet Dreams"
on the wall

20:51.667 --> 20:53.586
and I saw it and I said,
"Put it in the piece."

20:53.669 --> 20:56.422
‐ <i>It's the name of the horse.</i>
‐ We don't know who it is,

20:56.505 --> 20:58.466
but whoever it is,
we love you. It works.

20:58.549 --> 21:01.177
And I made a little gold mark
on his just now.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.678
He wants to,
like, make marks,

21:02.762 --> 21:04.388
I don't have a problem
with it.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.724
Like, we did this thing,
the Grotjahn thing,

21:06.807 --> 21:08.559
and I said, "Just go hit it,"

21:08.642 --> 21:11.479
and he just did
this little friggin'
whatever‐it‐is,

21:11.562 --> 21:12.605
and I think it's perfect.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.106
I think the collaboration, too,

21:14.190 --> 21:16.734
is, like, executing
the tone of the room too,

21:16.817 --> 21:21.197
does this wall come together
as a seamless whole?

21:38.339 --> 21:42.134
I, uh, caused
a lot of wreckage

21:42.218 --> 21:43.594
and a lot of pain

21:43.677 --> 21:45.346
and a lot of chaos.

21:45.429 --> 21:49.183
<i>And I'm still
a work in progress, you know,</i>

21:49.266 --> 21:51.101
<i>I'm still really new to this.</i>

21:51.185 --> 21:53.604
<i>But a lot's changed
over the course of the year</i>

21:53.687 --> 21:55.606
<i>because I put in
some intense work</i>

21:55.689 --> 21:58.067
<i>and I've been trying to get‐‐
get sober</i>

21:58.150 --> 22:00.110
<i>and get healthy
for a long time.</i>

22:00.194 --> 22:03.739
<i>And my living amends
to my dad</i>

22:03.823 --> 22:05.950
<i>is to grant him
peace of mind.</i>

22:06.033 --> 22:07.618
<i>It's a lifetime of work,</i>

22:07.701 --> 22:09.578
<i>and it's something
I get to practice‐‐</i>

22:09.662 --> 22:13.082
<i>I have the opportunity
to practice each day.</i>

22:15.042 --> 22:18.504
Jimmy:
<i>I had to, like, learn
about patience, acceptance,</i>

22:18.587 --> 22:20.714
<i>those things
that really test you.</i>

22:20.798 --> 22:22.591
<i>You say you love somebody,
you say whatever,</i>

22:22.675 --> 22:24.802
but until you're in that arena

22:24.885 --> 22:26.679
and you're wrestling
with those beasts and stuff,

22:26.762 --> 22:29.139
that's where you find out
where your character's at.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.891
<i>You know,
at the end of the day,</i>

22:30.975 --> 22:32.560
<i>he's someone that needs help,
he's sick.</i>

22:32.643 --> 22:34.436
<i>I gotta figure out a way
to have a relationship,</i>

22:34.520 --> 22:36.021
<i>but have a boundary,</i>

22:36.105 --> 22:37.898
<i>that I can protect myself
and take care of myself</i>

22:37.982 --> 22:40.693
<i>and my wife and my family.</i>

22:46.156 --> 22:49.451
<i>You know,
maybe part of the thing
about doing this thing</i>

22:49.535 --> 22:51.662
<i>is that I'm hoping,
when somebody sees this,</i>

22:51.745 --> 22:54.331
<i>is that yeah,
there's a lot of pain,</i>

22:54.415 --> 22:56.458
<i>there's a lot of scars,
there's a lot of wounding,</i>

22:56.542 --> 22:58.961
<i>but you know, there is healing
and there is‐‐</i>

22:59.044 --> 23:01.672
<i>there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.</i>

23:01.755 --> 23:06.135
But you gotta do the work,
you gotta do the time.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.680
When you told me the other day
that you trusted me again...

23:09.763 --> 23:13.058
was huge...
that was huge.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.686
‐ Yeah, but you had to earn it.
‐ Yeah, I know.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.646
You had to earn it.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.231
And you have.

23:19.315 --> 23:23.611
You know,
trust is a key component
of any relationship.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.363
You don't have trust, man,
you don't have honesty,

23:26.447 --> 23:29.199
you don't have the tenets,
you don't have the foundation,

23:29.283 --> 23:30.951
you don't have anything.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.661
That's what I'm saying,
you know,

23:32.745 --> 23:34.747
some of the stuff
that went on between
you and I,

23:34.830 --> 23:37.166
I just...
it was hard shit.

23:37.249 --> 23:42.588
And... And I know that
everything happens in life
for a reason,

23:42.671 --> 23:46.425
but... there was
a lot of pain there.

23:46.508 --> 23:50.596
But you know,
trusting you is...

23:57.937 --> 24:00.689
‐ ( voice breaking ) Thank you.
‐ You're welcome, Papa.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.775
No, really,
fuckin' thanks.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.694
I'm not gonna fuckin' cry
through the whole
fuckin' thing.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.988
‐ ( laughs )
‐ Fuck.
