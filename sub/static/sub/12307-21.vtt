WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:02.333
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.333 --> 00:03.604
THE GRAYSONS MURDERED MY FATHER.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.506
AUNT CAROLE, TELL HER
ABOUT THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.039
THERE WAS A MAN
WHO VISITED GRAYSON

00:08.039 --> 00:09.610
THE MORNING
YOUR FATHER DIED.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.142
THIS FEELING COMES ALONG
ONCE OR TWICE IN A LIFETIME

00:11.142 --> 00:12.613
IF WE'RE LUCKY.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.486
I WANT FULL IMMUNITY
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE INFORMATION

00:15.486 --> 00:16.547
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU.

00:16.547 --> 00:18.119
THIS IS AGENT McGOWEN
OF THE S.E.C.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.120
Come down
to the Federal Building

00:19.120 --> 00:20.551
and answer some questions.

00:20.551 --> 00:23.454
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON
THE ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION?

00:23.454 --> 00:25.226
MY FATHER IS THE VICTIM
OF A WITCH HUNT.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.558
(Emily) CONRAD CONFESSED
EVERYTHING TO DANIEL.

00:27.558 --> 00:29.100
HE COULD'VE COME CLEAN.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.202
HE COULD'VE ENDED
THE WHOLE THING.

00:31.202 --> 00:32.302
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

00:32.302 --> 00:35.166
I'M GONNA TRACK DOWN THE MAN
WHO KILLED MY FATHER.

00:35.166 --> 00:38.169
(shovel scraping)

00:48.749 --> 00:51.652
(Emily) THEY SAY GRIEF OCCURS
IN FIVE STAGES.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.487
FIRST, THERE'S DENIAL...

00:59.190 --> 01:01.462
FOLLOWED BY ANGER.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.235
(crying)

01:04.235 --> 01:06.767
THEN COMES BARGAINING...

01:06.767 --> 01:08.569
AND DEPRESSION.

01:17.508 --> 01:18.709
(David) HEY, DID YOU KNOW

01:18.709 --> 01:21.112
THAT AMANDA TURNED 10
THIS SUMMER?

01:22.513 --> 01:24.255
WHATEVER HAPPENS
WITH YOUR INVESTIGATION,

01:24.255 --> 01:27.818
CAN YOU MAKE SURE THAT A COPY
OF THIS INTERVIEW GETS TO HER?

01:27.818 --> 01:30.621
I GUESS I JUST WANT AMANDA
TO KNOW THAT...

01:30.621 --> 01:33.494
NOT EVERY DAY
IS A TERRIBLE ONE. (chuckles)

01:33.494 --> 01:36.497
YOUR DAD HAD A GOOD DAY TODAY,
SWEETHEART.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.429
I HOPE YOU DID, TOO.

01:38.429 --> 01:41.432
I LOVE YOU.(sighs)

01:41.432 --> 01:43.534
(clicks keyboard key)

01:43.534 --> 01:46.377
(Emily) FOR MOST,
THE FINAL STAGE OF GRIEF

01:46.377 --> 01:48.709
IS ACCEPTANCE.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.443
BUT FOR ME...

01:52.443 --> 01:56.847
GRIEF IS A LIFE SENTENCE
WITHOUT CLEMENCY.

01:56.847 --> 02:00.521
I WILL NEVER ACCEPT
AND I WILL NEVER FORGIVE,

02:00.521 --> 02:02.723
NOT EVEN AFTER THE MAN
WHO KILLED MY FATHER

02:02.723 --> 02:04.855
LIES DEAD AT MY FEET.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.164
AGENT McGOWEN CANCELED
HIS ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW.

02:13.164 --> 02:14.465
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT MEANS?

02:14.465 --> 02:16.167
IT MEANS
THEIR FISHING EXPEDITION

02:16.167 --> 02:17.238
CAME UP EMPTY.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.570
WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.643
CHANCES ARE, McGOWEN IS JUST
GONNA HEAD FOR DEEPER WATERS.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.914
SO WHAT DO WE DO
IN THE MEANTIME?

02:23.914 --> 02:26.277
WE KEEP THE P.R. MACHINE
RUNNING OVERTIME

02:26.277 --> 02:28.579
TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE
THEY'VE ALREADY CAUSED.

02:28.579 --> 02:30.721
ASHLEY'S PLANS
TO TIE YOUR WEDDING

02:30.721 --> 02:32.353
INTO REHABILITATING
OUR CORPORATE IMAGE

02:32.353 --> 02:34.154
IS A VERY GOOD ONE.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.656
JUST MAKE SURE EMILY'S
ON BOARD WITH THAT.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.658
AND... WE NEED TO ENSURE

02:37.658 --> 02:40.291
THAT THE OUTSTANDING
LOOSE ENDS FROM YOUR TRIAL

02:40.291 --> 02:41.792
REMAIN TIED UP,

02:41.792 --> 02:44.595
MAINLY... THAT JACK PORTER

02:44.595 --> 02:46.337
KEEPS HIS VERSION OF
THE EVENTS OF THAT NIGHT

02:46.337 --> 02:47.498
TO HIMSELF.

02:47.498 --> 02:48.669
I'VE GOT A PLAN FOR THAT.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.901
GOOD. GET ON IT, SON.

02:50.901 --> 02:52.843
(telephone ringing in distance)

02:52.843 --> 02:54.645
DANIEL...

02:54.645 --> 02:57.177
(sighs) I CAN'T TELL YOU

02:57.177 --> 03:00.211
HOW MUCH YOUR LOYALTY
THROUGH THIS CHALLENGING TIME

03:00.211 --> 03:01.652
MEANS TO ME.

03:01.652 --> 03:04.255
FAMILY FIRST, LIKE YOU SAID.

03:04.255 --> 03:06.317
BUT WHEN WE'RE THROUGH THIS,

03:06.317 --> 03:09.360
I WANNA HOLD YOU
TO THE PROMISE YOU MADE ME.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.223
100% TRANSPARENCY
FROM HERE ON OUT.

03:12.223 --> 03:14.865
(cell phone rings)

03:14.865 --> 03:16.427
(ring)

03:16.427 --> 03:17.598
(beep)

03:17.598 --> 03:18.769
HEY.

03:18.769 --> 03:20.271
(Nolan) Are you watching?
 YEAH.

03:20.271 --> 03:23.604
WHAT DO YOU THINK DANIEL MEANT
ABOUT HIS PLAN FOR JACK?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.706
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF ANYMORE.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.908
(man) BUSINESS AS USUAL,
I SEE.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.440
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:29.440 --> 03:31.242
THE FEDS ARE ALL OVER ME.

03:31.242 --> 03:32.543
PRECISELY THE REASON
FOR MY VISIT.

03:32.543 --> 03:33.714
EMILY...

03:33.714 --> 03:35.386
SHH.

03:35.386 --> 03:36.617
YOU'VE BECOME, AS THEY SAY
IN YOUR PROFESSION,

03:36.617 --> 03:38.389
A BAD ASSET.

03:38.389 --> 03:40.791
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR EMPLOYERS ARE NERVOUS,

03:40.791 --> 03:42.493
BUT I ASSURE YOU...
(chuckles)

03:42.493 --> 03:44.625
I HAVE ALL OF THIS HANDLED.

03:44.625 --> 03:48.259
I'M AFRAID YOUR WORD ISN'T
GOING TO SATISFY THE INITIATIVE.

03:48.259 --> 03:51.702
WELL, WHAT ELSE
CAN I POSSIBLY OFFER?

03:51.702 --> 03:55.366
THAT QUESTION IS
BEING ADDRESSED AS WE SPEAK.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.614
HANDSOME FAMILY.

04:03.614 --> 04:06.347
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.949
MY GOD, EMS...

04:08.949 --> 04:10.281
IT'S HIM.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.860
EMILY, ARE YOU THERE?

04:19.860 --> 04:22.733
I'M HERE.

04:22.733 --> 04:26.337
(sighs)
What are you gonna do?

04:26.337 --> 04:29.640
I'M GONNA CREATE A REASON
FOR THEM TO MEET AGAIN.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.342
AND THEN I'M GONNA TRACK
THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN

04:31.342 --> 04:32.903
TO WHEREVER HE'S HIDING.

04:32.903 --> 04:34.645
AND THEN?

04:34.645 --> 04:37.678
YOU ALREADY KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

04:38.979 --> 04:43.314
(beep)

04:43.314 --> 04:46.317
♪♪♪

04:57.998 --> 05:00.000
YOU FEELING ANY BETTER?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.872
YOUR HEADACHE LAST NIGHT--

05:01.872 --> 05:04.405
I CAN'T REMEMBER YOU BEING SICK
THE WHOLE TIME I'VE KNOWN YOU.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.736
WELL, WE HAVEN'T KNOWN
EACH OTHER ALL THAT LONG,

05:05.736 --> 05:07.037
HAVE WE?

05:07.037 --> 05:09.640
EMILY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:09.640 --> 05:11.311
TALK TO ME.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.843
WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO PARIS...

05:12.843 --> 05:14.345
ELOPING,
JUST THE TWO OF US?

05:14.345 --> 05:16.617
THAT WAS BEFORE EVERYTHING.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.749
ALL RIGHT, GRAYSON GLOBAL
HAS A MASSIVE IMAGE PROBLEM,

05:18.749 --> 05:20.951
AND SINCE I'M THE ONE
WHO'S LARGELY RESPONSIBLE,

05:20.951 --> 05:22.953
I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY JOB
TO FIX IT.

05:22.953 --> 05:25.996
BY MAKING OUR WEDDING
A BIG, PUBLIC SPECTACLE?

05:25.996 --> 05:28.028
LOOK, ASHLEY AND I
ARE CUTTING OUT EARLY TODAY

05:28.028 --> 05:30.000
SO SHE CAN PITCH US
HER IDEAS.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.563
A BIG, SPLASHY WEDDING,
ONE OF YOUR PARENTS' EVENTS--

05:32.563 --> 05:36.006
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ME OR YOU
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.868
LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOU WERE
PRACTICALLY PUSHING ME

05:37.868 --> 05:40.711
TO CLAIM MY FATHER'S MANTLE
AT THE COMPANY.

05:40.711 --> 05:43.043
LOOK, ASHLEY'S PUT
A LOT OF WORK INTO THIS,

05:43.043 --> 05:44.545
AND IT MAY NOT BE YOU
OR EVEN ME,

05:44.545 --> 05:46.046
BUT GIVEN WHAT
MY FAMILY'S BEEN THROUGH,

05:46.046 --> 05:48.118
CAN WE JUST SIT DOWN WITH HER
FOR FIVE MINUTES?

05:48.118 --> 05:50.050
PLEASE.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.582
(sighs) OF COURSE I CAN.

05:53.984 --> 05:56.086
I LOVE YOU.

05:56.086 --> 05:58.358
HAVE A GOOD RUN.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.134
(door closes)

06:06.036 --> 06:09.039
(shower running)

06:29.820 --> 06:31.562
(Charlotte)
DR. CLEMONS IS HERE.

06:31.562 --> 06:33.464
SHOULD WE FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE
TO DO THIS?

06:33.464 --> 06:35.025
NOT IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
IN HERE.

06:35.025 --> 06:37.828
I'D HATE TO INTERRUPT
THE PROGRESS YOU'RE MAKING.

06:37.828 --> 06:39.800
IT'S IRONIC, RIGHT?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.101
DANIEL GOES FREE,

06:41.101 --> 06:43.073
AND NOW I'M THE ONE BASICALLY
UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

06:43.073 --> 06:44.475
(beeps and unlocks)

06:44.475 --> 06:47.808
NO SCHOOL, NO FATHER,
NO FRIENDS, NO DECLAN.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.139
(closes door)

06:49.139 --> 06:50.911
WELL...

06:50.911 --> 06:52.943
IN TERMS OF SCHOOL,

06:52.943 --> 06:54.945
I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN
TO THE DEAN,

06:54.945 --> 06:57.047
AND YOU WILL BE
STARTING AGAIN NEXT WEEK.

06:57.047 --> 06:58.919
AND AS FOR DECLAN,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.050
DO NOT FORGET THAT HIS LIES

07:00.050 --> 07:01.992
ARE WHAT PUT YOU HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:01.992 --> 07:03.554
HIS AND YOURS.

07:03.554 --> 07:05.055
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

07:05.055 --> 07:06.497
DR. CLEMONS WANTS TO DO

07:06.497 --> 07:08.428
A FAMILY THERAPY SESSION
TONIGHT.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.560
(scoffs) THAT IS NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.602
WHY, BECAUSE YOU AND DAD
DESPISE EACH OTHER?

07:11.602 --> 07:13.103
DR. CLEMONS SAYS

07:13.103 --> 07:15.435
THE ONLY WAY I CAN OVERCOME
MY ANGER ISSUES

07:15.435 --> 07:17.538
IS TO LEARN TO FORGIVE,

07:17.538 --> 07:19.039
WHICH WILL BE
A WHOLE LOT EASIER TO DO

07:19.039 --> 07:20.971
IF YOU AND DAD
DO THE SAME.

07:22.713 --> 07:24.214
READY TO GET STARTED?

07:24.214 --> 07:26.216
YES, WHY DON'T YOU,
CHARLOTTE?

07:26.216 --> 07:29.750
WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER, HMM?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.522
MRS. GRAYSON.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.134
(door alert chimes)

07:49.199 --> 07:51.471
AGENT McGOWEN,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.103
WHY ISN'T MY EX-HUSBAND
IN PRISON?

07:53.103 --> 07:55.105
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T FOUND
ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

07:55.105 --> 07:56.607
OF A CONSPIRACY
TO FRAME DAVID CLARKE.

07:56.607 --> 07:58.549
WELL, THEN YOU
HAVEN'T LOOKED HARD ENOUGH.

07:58.549 --> 08:01.251
BEFORE CONRAD'S HEAD OF SECURITY
WAS MURDERED,

08:01.251 --> 08:02.583
HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD

08:02.583 --> 08:03.914
PERSONALLY AMASSED
ENOUGH EVIDENCE

08:03.914 --> 08:06.156
TO PUT EVERYONE INVOLVED
IN JAIL FOR GOOD.

08:06.156 --> 08:07.658
NOW HAVE YOU SEARCHED
HIS MANHATTAN APARTMENT?

08:07.658 --> 08:10.661
OUR WARRANT IS RESTRICTED
TO THE CORPORATE OFFICES.

08:10.661 --> 08:11.992
AND THE PROSECUTOR
CAN'T BUILD A FEDERAL CASE

08:11.992 --> 08:13.123
ON YOUR WORD ALONE.

08:13.123 --> 08:14.494
WELL, HE WON'T HAVE TO.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.496
YOU AND YOUR TEAM
ARE OBVIOUSLY INCAPABLE

08:16.496 --> 08:17.828
OF FINDING THE PROOF
THAT YOU NEED,

08:17.828 --> 08:21.131
BUT I ASSURE YOU
THAT I'M MORE THAN CAPABLE.

08:21.131 --> 08:23.904
I'M DETERMINED.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.037
(chuckles)

08:27.037 --> 08:30.210
(Jack) DO YOU THINK I DON'T SEE
RIGHT THROUGH THIS?

08:30.210 --> 08:33.784
SEE THROUGH WHAT, PORTER?
IT'S A CHECK, NOT A SHOE BOMB.

08:33.784 --> 08:35.215
IT'S BLOOD MONEY.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.746
IT'S TO KEEP ME QUIET
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS

08:36.746 --> 08:38.248
FRAMING THEIR PERSONAL THUG
FOR TYLER'S MURDER.

08:38.248 --> 08:40.190
YOU'RE WRONG.

08:40.190 --> 08:41.150
THE GUY WAS A DRIFTER.

08:41.150 --> 08:42.852
HE HAD NO TIES TO MY PARENTS

08:42.852 --> 08:45.556
OTHER THAN THE FACT
THAT HE WAS BLACKMAILING THEM.

08:45.556 --> 08:47.558
THEY WERE VICTIMS
OF HIS, TOO.

08:47.558 --> 08:49.029
(sighs) REALLY?

08:50.561 --> 08:52.532
COME ON, BUDDY.
DRINK SOME WATER.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.105
OKAY, LOOK, I GET
YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

08:55.105 --> 08:56.567
I'M TRYING TO FIX THAT...

08:56.567 --> 08:58.068
STILL NOT FEELING WELL, SAMMY?

08:58.068 --> 08:59.269
FOR EMILY'S SAKE.

08:59.269 --> 09:01.812
SHE TOLD ME HOW INVESTED
IN HAITI YOU ARE,

09:01.812 --> 09:03.313
AND I KNOW MY TRIAL
THREW OFF YOUR PLANS

09:03.313 --> 09:04.815
TO GET DOWN THERE
AND HELP.

09:04.815 --> 09:06.847
I ALSO KNOW YOU HAVE
THIS BAR AND YOUR BROTHER

09:06.847 --> 09:09.279
AND A GIRL SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT.

09:09.279 --> 09:11.822
AND I JUST THOUGHT THIS MONEY
MIGHT HELP YOU...

09:11.822 --> 09:15.225
DO SOME GOOD IN THE WORLD...

09:15.225 --> 09:17.187
ANY WAY YOU CHOOSE
TO USE IT.

09:22.132 --> 09:23.293
(door opens)

09:23.293 --> 09:25.866
(door closes)

09:25.866 --> 09:29.569
(elevator bell dings)

09:54.224 --> 09:57.167
I SEE
YOU'VE BEEN REDECORATING.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.869
I FIND YOUR CHOICE
OF FINE ART IN THE FOYER

09:58.869 --> 10:00.901
TO BE VERY INSPIRED.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.034
YEAH, WELL, THE de KOONING
HAS A SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

10:04.034 --> 10:06.206
AH. YOU LOOK GOOD,
CONRAD.

10:06.206 --> 10:10.641
ANDYOULOOK LIKE
A DEMONIC SUCCUBUS.

10:10.641 --> 10:12.843
YOU THINK I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WERE THE ONE

10:12.843 --> 10:14.144
WHO SICCED THE S.E.C.
ON ME?

10:14.144 --> 10:15.816
I'VE DONE NO SUCH THING.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.719
IF YOU GO DOWN, YOU'LL ONLY
BRING ME DOWN WITH YOU.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.350
YOU'VE ALREADY TOLD ME THAT
A THOUSAND TIMES.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.893
YOU CAN TRUST ME, I'M NOT GONNA
GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

10:22.893 --> 10:26.356
WELL, AS STRAINED AS THINGS
HAVE BEEN BETWEEN US,

10:26.356 --> 10:28.198
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T
WANT THAT, CONRAD.

10:28.198 --> 10:29.329
WELL, THEN I ASSUME
YOU'RE HERE

20:17.417 --> 20:18.588
DAMN RIGHT.

20:18.588 --> 20:22.492
IF YOU EVER THREATEN
TO HARM MY SON,

20:22.492 --> 20:25.224
HIS FIANCEE, OR ANYONE
IN MY FAMILY EVER AGAIN,

20:25.224 --> 20:26.696
I DETONATE.

20:28.298 --> 20:30.330
I NEVER THREATENED
YOUR SON.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.962
I'M NOT GONNA PLAY
THIS GAME WITH YOU.

20:32.962 --> 20:35.665
WHATEVER THE HELL'S GOING ON,
YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY FAMILY,

20:35.665 --> 20:38.438
OR I'M GONNA EXPOSE YOU
AND YOUR EMPLOYERS TO EVERYONE.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.370
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:52.452 --> 20:55.725
(camera phone shutter clicking)

20:57.026 --> 20:59.289
(cell phone alert chimes)

20:59.289 --> 21:03.593
(beeping)

21:03.593 --> 21:05.535
THAT'S IT.
 DANIEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:05.535 --> 21:07.537
WHO'S SO IMPORTANT THAT
YOU CAN'T BE PRESENT WITH ME

21:07.537 --> 21:09.339
ON THIS FOR FIVE MINUTES
WITHOUT EXCHANGING TEXTS?

21:09.339 --> 21:11.341
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:11.341 --> 21:12.472
AND NONE OF THIS IS ME.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.344
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN WHO I AM,
WHO YOU'RE MARRYING?

21:14.344 --> 21:16.406
HAVE YOU?
I'M A GRAYSON, EMILY.

21:16.406 --> 21:18.978
THERE ARE CERTAIN PRESSURES
AND EXPECTATIONS PLACED UPON ME,

21:18.978 --> 21:20.750
UPON US.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.852
MAYBE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
THE FAMILY YOU'RE MARRYING INTO.

21:22.852 --> 21:24.384
TRUST ME, DANIEL.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.985
I COULDN'T FORGET YOUR FAMILY
IF I TRIED.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.017
I'M DONE.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.522
(sighs)

21:32.522 --> 21:34.023
ASHLEY--

21:34.023 --> 21:37.296
PLEASE DON'T SAY YOU'RE SORRY.
YOU SO CLEARLY ARE NOT.

21:42.071 --> 21:43.573
(door opens)

21:43.573 --> 21:45.304
(door closes)

21:49.579 --> 21:53.312
♪♪♪

21:53.312 --> 21:56.346
HEY, DEC, YOU SEEN SAMMY?

21:56.346 --> 21:57.647
NO, I THOUGHT
HE WAS WITH YOU.

21:57.647 --> 21:59.349
DID YOU CHECK UPSTAIRS?
 I CHECKED EVERYWHERE.

21:59.349 --> 22:00.850
WHO'S SAMMY?
 MY BROTHER'S DOG.

22:00.850 --> 22:02.392
IT'S FREEZING OUT THERE.

22:02.392 --> 22:03.623
YOU DIDN'T LET HIM OUT
AND THEN FORGET, DID YOU?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.695
NO, NO, IN FACT,
I'VE HAD A HARD TIME

22:05.695 --> 22:07.697
GETTING HIM TO GO OUT AT ALL
THESE PAST COUPLE DAYS.

22:07.697 --> 22:09.028
I'M GONNA GO LOOK FOR HIM.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.600
GIVE ME A CALL
IF HE SHOWS UP, OKAY?

22:10.600 --> 22:12.562
YEAH.

22:12.562 --> 22:13.533
(door closes)

22:13.533 --> 22:15.605
(sighs)

22:15.605 --> 22:16.936
SCREW THE PRESENTATION.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.969
IF YOU WANT TO GO LOOK
FOR HIM, LET'S DO IT.

22:19.969 --> 22:25.715
(cell phone auto dials)

22:25.715 --> 22:27.877
I FINALLY GOT RID
OF ASHLEY AND DANIEL.

22:27.877 --> 22:29.479
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T LOSE HIM.

22:29.479 --> 22:31.020
I'VE GOT AN ADDRESS.

22:31.020 --> 22:33.423
HE'S THERE NOW.

22:33.423 --> 22:34.584
THANK YOU, NOLAN.

22:34.584 --> 22:35.785
(clicking)

22:35.785 --> 22:38.127
Once you turn this corner,
Emily, everything changes.

22:38.127 --> 22:40.560
ARE YOU CERTAIN
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.892
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I'M CERTAIN OF ANYMORE.

22:42.892 --> 22:44.133
TEXT ME THE ADDRESS.

22:47.497 --> 22:49.639
(cell phone alert chimes)

22:59.579 --> 23:01.380
I'M WORKING ON A SOLUTION.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.513
FIRST I HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHO'S
THREATENING GRAYSON'S FAMILY.

23:03.513 --> 23:06.085
(electricity crackles)

23:06.085 --> 23:09.559
THIS ISN'T SOME NOSY FED
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

23:09.559 --> 23:10.960
(clicking)

23:10.960 --> 23:14.093
SOMEONE'S ON TO US.

23:34.584 --> 23:37.046
(doorbell rings)

23:37.046 --> 23:40.820
(ticking)

23:43.723 --> 23:47.096
BE RIGHT THERE!

23:47.096 --> 23:48.698
(opens drawer)

23:54.003 --> 23:55.004
CAN I HELP YOU?

23:55.004 --> 23:56.936
UH, YEAH, I'M HERE ABOUT

23:56.936 --> 23:59.168
THE, UH, CABLE OUTAGES
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:59.168 --> 24:01.511
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
A PROBLEM WITH MY CABLE.

24:01.511 --> 24:04.844
OH, YEAH. THE BROWNOUTS FRIED
ALL THE BOXES ON YOUR BLOCK.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.846
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
THE LIGHTS FLICKERING?

24:06.846 --> 24:10.119
(crackles)

24:10.119 --> 24:12.051
COME ON IN.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.090
(doorbell rings)

24:21.090 --> 24:25.164
HE COULDN'T LET YOU
DO IT.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.496
WHERE IS HE?

24:26.496 --> 24:28.197
HE WOULDN'T SAY.

24:28.197 --> 24:29.669
CLEARLY, WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE PLANNING TONIGHT,

24:29.669 --> 24:31.170
IT'S NOT THE ANSWER.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.803
HEY, I WONDER WHAT YOUR FATHER
WOULD THINK OF THIS?

24:33.803 --> 24:35.545
HE'D PROBABLY WONDER
HOW HIS LITTLE GIRL

24:35.545 --> 24:37.006
GOT TO SUCH A POINT.

24:37.006 --> 24:38.678
(dog barking in distance)

24:38.678 --> 24:41.180
ALONE.
THAT'S HOW I GOT HERE.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.882
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.854
NOLAN INTERVENED
SO THAT YOU WOULDN'T MAKE

24:44.854 --> 24:46.155
A LIFE-ALTERING MISTAKE.

24:46.155 --> 24:48.187
IT'S NOT HIS JOB
TO PROTECT ME.

24:48.187 --> 24:51.721
NO, THAT WAS YOUR MOTHER
AND FATHER'S.

24:53.523 --> 24:55.525
WHAT I REMEMBER
ABOUT MY MOTHER

24:55.525 --> 24:58.067
IS THAT SHE WAS SICK MY ENTIRE
CHILDHOOD UNTIL SHE DIED,

24:58.067 --> 25:00.870
AND AS FOR MY FATHER, WELL, WE
BOTH KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

25:00.870 --> 25:02.902
YOU ARE SO STRONG-WILLED,

25:02.902 --> 25:05.174
JUST LIKE DAVID WAS.

25:05.174 --> 25:07.707
DEATH COMES ON ITS OWN.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.839
THERE'S NO NEED
IN HASTENING IT.

25:09.839 --> 25:11.180
TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE

25:11.180 --> 25:12.882
WHO WERE ON THE PLANE
WHEN IT EXPLODED.

25:12.882 --> 25:13.883
THERE MIGHT BE
A TIME AND A PLACE

25:13.883 --> 25:15.885
FOR KINDNESS AND FAIRNESS,

25:15.885 --> 25:18.788
BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT ONE OF THEM.

25:18.788 --> 25:20.519
GOOD-BYE, CAROLE.

25:22.992 --> 25:25.224
(electronic whirring)

25:25.224 --> 25:29.599
(woman speaking indistinctly
on TV)

25:29.599 --> 25:31.230
OH. (chuckles)

25:31.230 --> 25:35.635
THIS, UH, CLOCK SHOWS
OFFICIAL U.S. TIME, WHICH, UH,

25:35.635 --> 25:38.838
I CAN SEE MIGHT BE
OF INTEREST TO YOU.

25:38.838 --> 25:42.572
OR NOT.

25:43.973 --> 25:45.114
(exhales)

25:45.114 --> 25:46.976
(woman)
TELL ME ABOUT THE STOCK.

25:46.976 --> 25:49.118
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

25:49.118 --> 25:51.250
ONE MORE THING
BEFORE YOU GO.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.824
DO YOU HAVE A CARD?

25:54.824 --> 25:57.226
(ticking continues)

25:57.226 --> 25:59.288
SO I CAN TALK
TO YOUR SUPERVISOR...

25:59.288 --> 26:01.961
TO TELL HIM HOW...

26:01.961 --> 26:04.163
HAPPY I AM
WITH THE SERVICE.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.836
UHH.

26:06.836 --> 26:10.199
COMING TO FIX A PROBLEM
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD.

26:10.199 --> 26:12.301
UM, YOU KNOW, UH...

26:12.301 --> 26:14.003
I DON'T. (chuckles)

26:14.003 --> 26:16.746
WE'RE PRACTICALLY, UH,
A PAPERLESS COMPANY.

26:16.746 --> 26:20.179
YOU KNOW, TRYING TO OFFSET
OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.211
UH, WE DO HAVE A WEB SITE

26:22.211 --> 26:23.913
WHERE YOU CAN SUBMIT A FORM.

26:23.913 --> 26:26.285
I'LL DO THAT, BURT.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.187
WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?

26:29.919 --> 26:32.622
UH, SIMMONS.

26:32.622 --> 26:35.625
(chuckles)
HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

26:38.267 --> 26:40.299
YOU, TOO, BURT.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.234
(elevator bell dings)

26:49.939 --> 26:52.111
LYDIA...

26:52.111 --> 26:53.943
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

26:56.716 --> 26:58.087
VICTORIA...

26:58.087 --> 26:59.719
I CAME HOME,
AND SHE WAS HERE,

26:59.719 --> 27:03.052
TEARING YOUR PAINTING
INTO PIECES.

27:03.052 --> 27:05.995
(thud)
 SHE SAID
YOU WERE HIDING EVIDENCE

27:05.995 --> 27:07.326
THAT COULD DESTROY US ALL.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.229
I-I TRIED TO STOP HER,
BUT I COULDN'T.

27:10.229 --> 27:15.064
THAT WOMAN IS A MONSTER,
CONRAD.

27:15.064 --> 27:16.866
(papers hit floor)

27:17.937 --> 27:20.670
(presses button)

27:22.672 --> 27:24.013
YOU KNEW
WHAT THIS MEANT TO ME.

27:24.013 --> 27:25.374
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD BETRAY ME

27:25.374 --> 27:26.746
with the one thing--

27:26.746 --> 27:28.377
I DIDN'T BETRAY YOU, EMS.

27:28.377 --> 27:30.279
I'M GIVING YOU OPTIONS.

27:30.279 --> 27:32.752
NOW AT LEAST YOU CAN GATHER
INTEL ON THE GUY,

27:32.752 --> 27:34.754
FIND OUT WHO HE IS.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.325
YOU LISTEN TO ME, NOLAN--

27:36.325 --> 27:39.789
HOW ABOUT YOU LISTEN TO ME
FOR ONCE?

27:41.390 --> 27:42.932
HELLO?

27:44.393 --> 27:45.935
(beep)
 (sighs)

27:45.935 --> 27:47.036
SAMMY?

27:47.036 --> 27:49.839
SAMMY, HEY, BUDDY.

27:49.839 --> 27:51.971
(whimpers)

27:51.971 --> 27:53.873
OHH.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.875
(keypad beeps)

27:55.875 --> 27:57.947
(auto dials)

27:57.947 --> 27:59.048
(whistles)

27:59.048 --> 28:00.209
SAMMY!

28:00.209 --> 28:02.281
(cell phone rings)

28:03.282 --> 28:04.453
(beep)

28:04.453 --> 28:05.815
JACK.

28:05.815 --> 28:06.986
Emily, hey.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.187
SAMMY'S HERE.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.688
THANK GOD. (exhales)

28:09.688 --> 28:11.721
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T
THINK TO LOOK THERE.

28:11.721 --> 28:13.292
IS HE OKAY?

28:13.292 --> 28:15.294
JACK, I THINK
YOU BETTER HURRY.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.326
(sighs)

28:17.326 --> 28:19.398
(beep)

28:19.398 --> 28:21.801
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY.

28:27.136 --> 28:28.207
(Clemons) MRS. GRAYSON,
WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST?

28:28.207 --> 28:30.309
DEAR CHARLOTTE,

28:30.309 --> 28:33.182
I LIKE THAT YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR COUNSELING SERIOUSLY,

28:33.182 --> 28:35.184
BUT I NEED YOU
TO STOP DEMONIZING ME

28:35.184 --> 28:37.116
AND LIONIZING YOUR FATHER.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.748
BOTH OF YOU.
 (door opens)

28:38.748 --> 28:40.189
(door closes)
 (Clemons) GOOD.

28:40.189 --> 28:42.451
WHO'D LIKE TO GO NEXT?

28:42.451 --> 28:43.993
I'LL GO.

28:43.993 --> 28:46.155
GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US,
MR. GRAYSON.

28:46.155 --> 28:47.927
SO WHAT GAME
ARE WE PLAYING?

28:47.927 --> 28:49.258
WE'RE PLAYING
"I LIKE BUT I NEED."

28:49.258 --> 28:50.399
IT'S FUN. YOU'LL SEE.

28:50.399 --> 28:51.961
JUST SIT--

28:51.961 --> 28:53.362
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DOC.
I'VE GOT THIS FROM HERE.

28:55.064 --> 28:56.806
DANIEL...

28:56.806 --> 28:58.507
I LIKE VERY MUCH

28:58.507 --> 29:01.470
THAT YOU'VE MADE
THE FAMILY BUSINESS YOUR OWN,

29:01.470 --> 29:03.412
AND ALL
I REALLY NEED FROM YOU

29:03.412 --> 29:06.315
IS YOUR CONTINUED LOYALTY
THROUGH THE ROUGH DAYS AHEAD.

29:06.315 --> 29:08.177
CHARLOTTE, I LIKE THAT
YOU'VE TAKEN CONTROL

29:08.177 --> 29:10.249
OF THIS PROBLEM,

29:10.249 --> 29:14.323
AND I NEED YOU TO PROMISE ME
THAT YOU'LL STAY ON THIS TRACK.

29:14.323 --> 29:15.825
VICTORIA, YOU KNOW,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

29:15.825 --> 29:19.028
I ACTUALLY LIKE YOUR SPIRIT
OF SELF-PRESERVATION.

29:19.028 --> 29:21.090
ALWAYS HAVE, IN FACT.

29:21.090 --> 29:25.164
AND I THOROUGHLY APPRECIATE
HOW MUCH YOU HAVE CHALLENGED ME

29:25.164 --> 29:26.465
AT EVERY TURN
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE

29:26.465 --> 29:29.038
OF OUR SPECTACULAR FAILURE
OF A MARRIAGE...

29:29.038 --> 29:30.339
OH, MR. GRAYSON, THAT'S NOT--

29:30.339 --> 29:32.471
BECAUSE IT HAS TAUGHT ME
HOW TO SEE...

29:32.471 --> 29:35.104
RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

29:35.104 --> 29:37.176
AND AS FOR WHAT I NEED
FROM YOU, WELL, BY GOSH,

29:37.176 --> 29:39.308
ALL I REALLY NEED IS FOR YOU
TO COME TO YOUR ANEMIC SENSES

29:39.308 --> 29:42.451
AND RETURN EVERYTHING
YOU JUST STOLE FROM ME.

29:42.451 --> 29:44.113
AND, CONRAD,

29:44.113 --> 29:47.356
I LIKE THAT YOU SUSPECT ME,
PREDICTABLE AS YOU ARE,

29:47.356 --> 29:49.058
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW

29:49.058 --> 29:51.991
THAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN
BETRAYING YOU AS WELL,

29:51.991 --> 29:54.363
EVEN WHILE WARMING
YOUR BED.

29:54.363 --> 29:56.125
(Charlotte) MOM,

29:56.125 --> 29:57.366
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW?

29:57.366 --> 29:59.028
NOTHING I WOULDN'T DO AGAIN.

29:59.028 --> 30:00.329
(sighs)

30:00.329 --> 30:02.301
(sighs) THIS IS HOPELESS.

30:02.301 --> 30:05.074
NOTHING IN THIS HOUSE
IS EVER GONNA CHANGE.

30:05.074 --> 30:06.836
THE ONLY WAY OUT OF IT
IS TO LEAVE.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.980
BRAVO, CONRAD.

30:10.980 --> 30:12.982
THAT DISPLAY OF YOURS
SHOULD GO MILES

30:12.982 --> 30:16.315
TOWARDS HELPING
CHARLOTTE'S RECOVERY.

30:18.848 --> 30:20.019
HERE, BUDDY.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.391
(sniffles)

30:22.391 --> 30:24.994
I CAN GET HIM INTO THE TRUCK,
TAKE HIM BACK TO THE STOWAWAY.

30:24.994 --> 30:27.496
HE USED UP ALL HIS ENERGY
GETTING HERE.

30:27.496 --> 30:28.858
(sniffles)

30:28.858 --> 30:31.400
I THINK THIS IS
WHERE HE WANTS TO BE.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.103
EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS...

30:34.103 --> 30:35.434
(sniffles)

30:35.434 --> 30:37.506
HE'S HOME.

30:42.111 --> 30:44.343
YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY...

30:44.343 --> 30:48.517
EVERY DAY'S BEEN A GIFT.

30:48.517 --> 30:51.380
I WAS STARTING TO THINK
HE WAS GONNA LIVE FOREVER.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.983
(sniffles)

30:53.983 --> 30:55.324
OH.

30:55.324 --> 30:56.455
(sighs)

30:56.455 --> 30:58.427
I CAN'T DO IT.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.092
(crying)

31:03.092 --> 31:04.393
I DON'T KNOW
IF I HAVE IT IN ME

31:04.393 --> 31:06.095
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIM.
(sniffles)

31:06.095 --> 31:07.436
(exhales deeply)

31:07.436 --> 31:09.138
(sniffles)

31:09.138 --> 31:10.539
OHH.

31:10.539 --> 31:11.901
(sniffles)

31:11.901 --> 31:15.504
SAMMY... (sniffles)

31:15.504 --> 31:18.107
(sniffles)

31:18.107 --> 31:21.410
SAMMY, THANK YOU.

31:21.410 --> 31:24.013
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND...

31:24.013 --> 31:25.354
(sniffles)

31:25.354 --> 31:28.157
SUCH A GOOD LISTENER.

31:28.157 --> 31:29.458
(laughs)

31:29.458 --> 31:31.460
AND THANK YOU
FOR MAKING ME SMILE...

31:31.460 --> 31:32.621
(sniffles)

31:32.621 --> 31:35.164
EVERY DAY,
EVEN ON THE WORST OF 'EM.

31:35.164 --> 31:39.168
THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME
ABOUT LOYALTY...

31:39.168 --> 31:40.899
AND FRIENDSHIP.

31:42.431 --> 31:45.504
THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME
HOW TO LOVE.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.376
(sniffles)

31:50.109 --> 31:52.611
(crying) OH, SAMMY,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.483
(sniffles)
 THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

31:54.483 --> 31:56.415
(children laugh)

31:56.415 --> 31:58.347
(laughs) SAMMY.

31:58.347 --> 32:02.121
ARE YOU LICKING DADDY?
 OH, YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.352
(laughs) OH, SAMMY.

32:03.352 --> 32:06.055
(squeals and laughs)

32:06.055 --> 32:08.927
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.260
YOU GO ON NOW, OKAY?

32:11.260 --> 32:12.561
(exhales)

32:12.561 --> 32:14.663
(sniffles) YOU GO PLAY.

32:14.663 --> 32:17.106
(sniffles)

32:17.106 --> 32:19.668
YOU GO PLAY.

32:22.972 --> 32:25.244
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.
(sniffles)

32:27.616 --> 32:29.318
COME ON.

32:29.318 --> 32:31.450
(pants) WHO SPLASHES SOMEONE
WITH ICE-COLD SLUSH

32:31.450 --> 32:32.982
AND JUST DRIVES OFF?

32:32.982 --> 32:34.323
A TRUCKER FROM YONKERS.

32:34.323 --> 32:35.454
OH. (chuckles)

32:35.454 --> 32:36.625
WELL, LOOK,
LET'S GET YOU DRY.

32:36.625 --> 32:38.327
UM, I GOT TOWELS
IN THE BATHROOM,

32:38.327 --> 32:40.489
BUT ONE SECOND.

32:40.489 --> 32:42.231
HERE.

32:42.231 --> 32:44.193
(chuckles) OH.

32:44.193 --> 32:45.494
UM, DO YOU HAVE ANY PICTURES
OF YOUR DOG?

32:45.494 --> 32:47.166
WE CAN TAKE THE POSTER BOARDS

32:47.166 --> 32:48.497
FROM THAT PRESENTATION
WE'RE GONNA FAIL

32:48.497 --> 32:49.698
AND PUT THEM TO GOOD USE.

32:49.698 --> 32:52.401
GOOD IDEA.

32:52.401 --> 32:54.543
(door squeaks)

32:54.543 --> 32:55.604
(door closes)

33:00.179 --> 33:02.751
(crying) DECLAN.

33:04.413 --> 33:05.514
CHARLOTTE?

33:05.514 --> 33:08.417
OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
ARE YOU OKAY?

33:08.417 --> 33:10.119
THEY'RE AWFUL, DECLAN...

33:10.119 --> 33:11.990
MY ENTIRE FAMILY.

33:13.522 --> 33:15.464
LOOK, I'M...

33:15.464 --> 33:18.527
I'M SO SORRY
FOR PULLING YOUR TUITION.

33:18.527 --> 33:20.269
I'LL CASH IN
ONE OF MY SAVINGS BONDS--

33:20.269 --> 33:22.331
ACTUALLY, I GOT IT COVERED.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.405
OR NOLAN DOES. I MEAN,
THE GUY'S GOT A... HEART

33:26.405 --> 33:28.507
AS BIG AS HIS CHECKBOOK.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.439
SEE?

33:30.439 --> 33:33.542
SOMEONE ELSE APPRECIATES
HOW GOOD YOU ARE.

33:35.584 --> 33:38.547
CAN I STAY WITH YOU
TONIGHT?

33:38.547 --> 33:40.119
ARE ALL YOUR T-SHIRTS
DEEP V's?

33:40.119 --> 33:43.092
YOU'D DO GREAT WITH THE GIRLS
BACK HOME IN YONKERS.

33:43.092 --> 33:44.493
WOW. YOU WORK FAST.

33:44.493 --> 33:47.696
OH, CHARLOTTE, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

33:47.696 --> 33:50.229
YONKERS, HUH?

33:50.229 --> 33:53.262
DIDN'T EVEN NEED THE TRASHY TEE
TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.

33:53.262 --> 33:55.764
(exhales)
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

33:55.764 --> 33:57.736
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU DON'T KNOW

33:57.736 --> 34:00.509
THE FIRST THING ABOUT MY LIFE.

34:00.509 --> 34:04.213
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
ARE A WALKING TABLOID.

34:04.213 --> 34:06.545
EVERYONE HAS THINGS
IN THEIR PAST

34:06.545 --> 34:09.618
THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO KNOW ABOUT.

34:09.618 --> 34:11.580
RIGHT, DECLAN?

34:15.623 --> 34:17.525
(Daniel) ARE YOU REALLY

34:17.525 --> 34:19.358
SO BLINDED
BY YOUR HATRED FOR DAD

34:19.358 --> 34:22.130
THAT YOU'VE LOST SIGHT
OF ME AND CHARLOTTE?

34:22.130 --> 34:26.235
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD BOTH OF
YOUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.841
YOUR FATHER

34:32.841 --> 34:36.505
IS GUILTY
OF HEINOUS CRIMES, DANIEL.

34:36.505 --> 34:38.577
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

34:38.577 --> 34:40.579
I KNOW THE WHOLE STORY, SO YOU
CAN QUIT PLAYING INNOCENT.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.210
DAD TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

34:42.210 --> 34:45.684
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT LIES HE TOLD YOU,

34:45.684 --> 34:47.585
BUT YOU WOULD DO WELL
TO REMEMBER

34:47.585 --> 34:50.489
THAT THERE ARE THREE SIDES
TO EVERY STORY.

34:50.489 --> 34:51.790
OH, AND WHICH ONE
DID YOU SELL TO THE FEDS?

34:51.790 --> 34:54.493
YOU GO THROUGH
WITH DESTROYING DAD,

34:54.493 --> 34:56.695
AND YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.

35:05.174 --> 35:06.675
(exhales deeply)

35:06.675 --> 35:08.377
(sniffles)

35:12.110 --> 35:14.112
HE WAS A REALLY GOOD FRIEND.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.445
(sniffles)

35:16.445 --> 35:18.747
SO WERE YOU.

35:18.747 --> 35:21.750
(sobbing)

35:21.750 --> 35:25.254
OH, JACK, I'M SO SORRY.

35:25.254 --> 35:26.655
I'M SO SORRY.

35:26.655 --> 35:27.826
(sniffles)

35:27.826 --> 35:31.129
(sobbing)

35:32.761 --> 35:35.534
I'M SO SORRY.

35:35.534 --> 35:38.607
(sniffling)

36:11.540 --> 36:15.173
(panting)

36:19.708 --> 36:22.451
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE IT.

36:24.453 --> 36:26.585
I'LL GO GET HIM.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.717
ARE YOU OKAY?

36:28.717 --> 36:30.619
(sniffles)

36:30.619 --> 36:34.363
IT'S JUST NICE,
HAVING SOMEBODY WITH ME.

36:34.363 --> 36:37.266
(waves crashing)

36:37.266 --> 36:40.499
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE AMANDA.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.431
NOW IT FEELS LIKE
THE ONLY PART OF ME

36:42.431 --> 36:44.433
LEFT HANGING ON TO HER

36:44.433 --> 36:46.435
IS GONNA BE BURIED WITH HIM.

36:46.435 --> 36:48.307
(sniffles)

36:48.307 --> 36:50.279
(sighs)

36:51.580 --> 36:55.544
MAYBE SAMMY KNEW IT WAS TIME
FOR YOU TO LET GO.

36:55.544 --> 36:59.788
MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE JUMPED UP
ON YOU IN THE PARK THAT DAY...

37:01.350 --> 37:04.493
WHY HE KEPT RUNNING
OVER TO YOUR HOUSE.

37:04.493 --> 37:08.257
HE WAS LEADING ME TO YOU.

37:08.257 --> 37:10.859
(exhales) EMILY...

37:13.231 --> 37:15.634
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

37:19.708 --> 37:22.641
I DON'T KNOW.

37:43.392 --> 37:45.033
(shovel thuds)

37:48.937 --> 37:51.870
(brakes squeal)

37:51.870 --> 37:53.302
(shifts gears)

37:53.302 --> 37:55.474
YOU'RE LATE.

37:55.474 --> 37:58.046
RELAX.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.687
(engine rumbles)

38:11.590 --> 38:12.661
(footsteps approach)

38:12.661 --> 38:16.565
I'M GOING TO AGREE
TO YOUR ULTIMATUM.

38:17.866 --> 38:21.299
MY DEVOTION TO YOU
TRUMPS EVERYTHING, DANIEL.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.773
I ONLY HOPE THAT I CAN REPAIR
THE DAMAGE I'VE CAUSED.

38:26.835 --> 38:29.778
THIS IS THE EVIDENCE I WAS
PLANNING ON TURNING OVER.

38:29.778 --> 38:33.882
NOW YOUR FATHER HAD IT
STASHED AWAY FOR YEARS

38:33.882 --> 38:37.586
AS INSURANCE BECAUSE HE'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE IT INCRIMINATES.

38:37.586 --> 38:40.318
WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO IT
WITH IT...

38:40.318 --> 38:42.591
IS ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

38:45.794 --> 38:47.856
(clattering)

38:47.856 --> 38:50.629
(clicks briefcase latches)

38:57.836 --> 39:01.109
(exhales)

39:01.109 --> 39:03.111
(keypad beeps)

39:03.111 --> 39:04.613
(auto dials)

39:04.613 --> 39:06.575
(phone rings)

39:06.575 --> 39:07.716
(Conrad) Yes, Daniel?

39:07.716 --> 39:09.918
MOM BUCKLED.
SHE GAVE ME THE EVIDENCE.

39:09.918 --> 39:11.580
It's right here
in my briefcase.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.051
GOOD WORK, SON.

39:13.051 --> 39:16.625
Bring it to me
in the morning.

39:16.625 --> 39:18.026
(beep)

39:38.977 --> 39:40.649
(sniffles)

39:43.412 --> 39:45.013
DEC...

39:45.013 --> 39:47.015
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

39:47.015 --> 39:48.957
SAMMY?

39:50.619 --> 39:52.390
HE'S GONE.

39:58.627 --> 40:01.630
(crying)

40:07.906 --> 40:09.738
(cell phone rings)

40:09.738 --> 40:12.180
(ring)

40:12.180 --> 40:14.783
(rings and beeps)

40:14.783 --> 40:16.485
(sighs)

40:16.485 --> 40:17.786
I WAS JUST GONNA CALL YOU.

40:17.786 --> 40:21.049
OH, TO YELL AT ME AGAIN
FOR SAVING YOUR LIFE?

40:21.049 --> 40:22.591
No.

40:22.591 --> 40:24.693
TO THANK YOU.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.658
I'M STARTING TO SEE THE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

40:29.658 --> 40:32.731
(sighs deeply)

40:32.731 --> 40:34.733
If I had gone through
with it today...

40:34.733 --> 40:36.665
THERE'D BE NO LIGHT...

40:36.665 --> 40:38.136
ever.

40:40.168 --> 40:43.572
BUT NOW...

40:43.572 --> 40:44.743
(clicks keyboard keys)

40:44.743 --> 40:46.675
WE HAVE GOT EYES
INSIDE HIS HOUSE.

40:46.675 --> 40:49.678
YOU SHOULDA SEEN ME, EMS.
 (objects clattering)

40:49.678 --> 40:51.850
I HACKED INTO
AN ELECTRICAL GRID,

40:51.850 --> 40:54.753
JAMMED A SATELLITE, AND...

40:54.753 --> 40:56.685
PAID OFF A CABLE GUY.

40:56.685 --> 40:58.687
You'd have been proud.

40:58.687 --> 41:00.228
I AM PROUD.

41:00.228 --> 41:03.061
You're a good friend.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.232
(car door closes)

41:04.232 --> 41:06.795
I GOTTA GO.
 (beep)

41:06.795 --> 41:07.866
(sighs)

41:07.866 --> 41:09.968
(beep)
 (chuckles)

41:09.968 --> 41:14.603
THEY SAY GRIEF OCCURS
IN FIVE STAGES.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.079
FIRST, THERE'S DENIAL.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.250
(door opens)

41:22.250 --> 41:24.182
EMILY?

41:25.814 --> 41:27.816
(door closes)
 HEY.

41:27.816 --> 41:30.919
FOLLOWED BY ANGER.

41:32.761 --> 41:36.665
DANIEL, I'M SO SORRY.

41:36.665 --> 41:39.528
OH, BABE, I, UH...

41:41.570 --> 41:44.132
THEN COMES BARGAINING,
DEPRESSION,

41:44.132 --> 41:46.775
AND ACCEPTANCE.

41:46.775 --> 41:50.238
COME ON.
LET'S GO TO BED.

41:50.238 --> 41:53.281
YEAH.

41:53.281 --> 41:57.115
BUT GRIEF
IS A MERCILESS MASTER.

41:59.918 --> 42:02.791
JUST WHEN YOU THINK
YOU'RE FREE...

42:06.254 --> 42:10.559
YOU REALIZE,
YOU NEVER STOOD A CHANCE.

42:11.900 --> 42:14.062
8:20?

42:14.062 --> 42:16.605
WAIT. THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

42:16.605 --> 42:18.206
OHH! (grunts)

42:18.206 --> 42:20.609
SHH.
 (grunts)

42:20.609 --> 42:23.612
(groaning)
