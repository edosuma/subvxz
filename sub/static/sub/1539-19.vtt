WEBVTT

00:00.722 --> 00:02.354
<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

00:02.385 --> 00:04.566
I had a meeting with the
board of Wayne Enterprises.

00:04.817 --> 00:06.432
I told them I was investigating them.

00:06.467 --> 00:08.441
So they sent someone
we'd trust to spy on us.

00:08.504 --> 00:10.005
<i>Alfred was stabbed.</i>

00:10.039 --> 00:11.640
<i>It was a friend of his from the army.</i>

00:11.674 --> 00:14.184
- What was he looking for?
- Some of my files are missing.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.578
I could find out who hired
him. He's the key to everything.

00:16.613 --> 00:19.005
I have a plan. I promise you,

00:19.020 --> 00:21.316
I will get some of us out of here alive.

00:21.351 --> 00:24.753
- Who are you?
- Dr. Francis Dulmacher.

00:24.787 --> 00:26.955
The people in the basement trust me.

00:26.990 --> 00:29.491
Put me in charge, and I promise you

00:29.526 --> 00:31.604
<i>a dependable flow of healthy product.</i>

00:31.617 --> 00:32.695
<i>And if I fail?</i>

00:32.709 --> 00:35.264
Those who fail me still have their uses.

00:35.298 --> 00:36.965
What are they doing?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.001
I'm sorry, honey, you're on the list.

00:39.035 --> 00:41.370
Half the cops on the GCPD have a Cobblepot,

00:41.404 --> 00:44.006
and Loeb has the goods on all of them.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.675
- That is what Loeb does.
- Well, it ends now.

00:46.709 --> 00:47.876
So what do you want?

00:47.911 --> 00:50.111
<i>With the coming election for president</i>

00:50.161 --> 00:51.680
of the policeman's union,

00:51.714 --> 00:53.901
<i>there's no man I'd rather support.</i>

00:53.914 --> 00:56.218
It's a new day in the GCPD.

01:22.927 --> 01:25.295
- Hmm, looking good, Ms. Cavanaugh.
- Thank you.

01:25.329 --> 01:27.030
- How's that swelling?
- Fine.

01:27.064 --> 01:30.066
If you need more ice
packs, I'll let Denise know.

01:30.697 --> 01:33.136
Mr. Douglas, I know you
don't like your view,

01:33.171 --> 01:35.172
and as soon as a recovery suite is open,

01:35.206 --> 01:37.700
- I'm going to move you.
- Oh.

01:48.686 --> 01:51.354
(alarm blaring)

02:15.688 --> 02:17.447
Is there a problem?

02:17.482 --> 02:20.246
- You're outside.
- You're observant.

02:20.484 --> 02:21.984
I'm the new assistant for the doctor.

02:22.019 --> 02:24.453
I'm Fish. And you are?

02:24.488 --> 02:25.922
Inside you're free to roam...

02:25.956 --> 02:28.230
That's Dr. Dulmacher's prerogative...

02:28.531 --> 02:32.161
But once you step outside,
you're in my world.

02:32.339 --> 02:35.942
I'm the man who catches the poor
souls brave enough to try to escape.

02:35.976 --> 02:37.877
Ah, you're The Catcher.

02:37.912 --> 02:40.513
I've heard a lot about you. (chuckles)

02:40.548 --> 02:42.916
So, have there been many?

02:42.950 --> 02:45.485
Poor souls, I mean.

02:45.519 --> 02:47.220
No.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.988
The water does most of the work,

02:50.489 --> 02:53.059
but every so often, someone gets stupid

02:53.094 --> 02:55.195
and gives it a go.

02:55.229 --> 02:57.864
I didn't know I wasn't
supposed to be outside.

02:57.898 --> 02:59.632
My mistake.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.501
Make that mistake again,

03:01.535 --> 03:03.803
and it'll be your last.

03:14.682 --> 03:16.783
I saw the papers the other day.

03:16.817 --> 03:19.280
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.956
So what does president of the
policeman's union do, exactly?

03:22.990 --> 03:25.458
Depends on the president.

03:25.493 --> 03:27.727
- I see.
- How's Alfred?

03:28.963 --> 03:31.131
W-Whinier than I thought. Mm.

03:31.165 --> 03:33.133
No, he-he's getting better.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.301
Glad to hear it.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.574
You two lied about who
stabbed him, didn't you?

03:43.577 --> 03:45.645
That's why you're here?

03:45.679 --> 03:48.320
- Is it?
- Yes.

03:49.617 --> 03:51.918
Did you?

03:52.953 --> 03:55.021
Lie to me?

03:56.424 --> 03:58.024
No.

03:58.059 --> 04:00.126
If we don't have a
description of the culprit,

04:00.161 --> 04:02.328
we won't find him.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.398
I wish I could help you, Detective.

04:07.835 --> 04:11.438
Alfred wants to go after him on his own.

04:11.472 --> 04:12.839
That's why you lied to me.

04:13.841 --> 04:15.408
No.

04:15.443 --> 04:17.777
Bruce, look at me.

04:17.812 --> 04:20.613
Whatever Alfred is up to,
you have to stay out of it.

04:20.648 --> 04:24.150
It's dangerous, and it's not your fight.

04:24.185 --> 04:26.686
I cut this bread way too thick, didn't I?

04:26.721 --> 04:28.788
Bruce...

04:30.324 --> 04:32.625
I understand what you're saying.

04:37.231 --> 04:39.065
Okay, then.

04:41.569 --> 04:43.169
(sighs)

04:46.741 --> 04:48.742
(ship's horn blowing)

04:51.278 --> 04:52.579
Detective Gordon,

04:52.613 --> 04:54.814
Len Moore.

04:54.849 --> 04:56.816
Officer, what can I help you with?

04:56.851 --> 04:58.960
- You're a man with a reputation.
- Oh, yeah?

04:58.998 --> 05:01.554
A Gotham detective who
actually closes cases.

05:01.589 --> 05:03.189
I try.

05:06.861 --> 05:08.895
Uh, that's actually why I'm here.

05:08.929 --> 05:10.563
Oh, yeah?

05:10.598 --> 05:11.731
See, a few weeks ago,

05:11.766 --> 05:13.133
I was a first responder to a homicide.

05:13.167 --> 05:14.834
Victim's name was Grace Fairchild.

05:15.970 --> 05:17.904
They found her body down by
the river, stabbed to death,

05:17.938 --> 05:19.639
and the detectives who caught the case,

05:19.674 --> 05:21.574
they got nowhere with it and moved on.

05:21.609 --> 05:24.110
I'm sorry to hear that, but it happens.

05:24.145 --> 05:26.579
I was wondering if you could
pick up where they left off.

05:26.614 --> 05:28.581
You want me to take over the case?

05:28.616 --> 05:30.383
- Yeah.
- (sighs)

05:30.418 --> 05:32.952
Look, Len, I got a full boat here.

05:32.987 --> 05:36.289
This victim's family, they deserve justice.

05:36.324 --> 05:38.158
- Well, yeah.
- Her killer deserves

05:38.192 --> 05:39.492
to pay for what he did.

05:39.527 --> 05:41.561
This was a nasty one.

05:42.563 --> 05:45.031
They're all nasty.
What's your angle on this?

05:45.066 --> 05:48.568
No angle. It's just...

05:48.602 --> 05:50.303
Well, there's a few of us younger guys,

05:50.338 --> 05:52.305
and we've been watching
what you've been doing

05:52.340 --> 05:54.140
to clean up Gotham and the GCPD.

05:54.175 --> 05:58.411
And I want to be a part of
it, and bringing you this case

05:58.446 --> 06:00.347
is my way of trying to do that.

06:04.585 --> 06:06.252
I'll look into it.

06:16.097 --> 06:17.964
Ready to go?

06:17.999 --> 06:19.499
Ready?

06:19.533 --> 06:20.834
I have been dreaming

06:20.868 --> 06:22.702
about the carbonara at Luccio's all day.

06:22.737 --> 06:25.572
- New case?
- Uh, sort of.

06:25.606 --> 06:28.608
It's an unsolved homicide
a uni asked me to look into.

06:28.643 --> 06:31.244
- It's an odd one.
- Ooh, how so?

06:31.278 --> 06:33.079
I thought you were hungry?

06:34.081 --> 06:36.816
What can I say? You had me at homicide.

06:36.851 --> 06:40.754
The victim, Grace Fairchild,
was found two weeks ago.

06:40.788 --> 06:42.922
She was reported missing
four months earlier.

06:42.957 --> 06:46.459
Last anyone heard, she,
uh, called her mother.

06:46.494 --> 06:48.361
Said she was having a drink
at a bar in the South Village.

06:48.396 --> 06:51.097
That's my neighborhood. What bar?

06:51.132 --> 06:54.334
Detectives canvassed
the area. Nobody knows.

06:54.368 --> 06:55.535
No leads, no tips.

06:55.569 --> 06:57.570
I'm staring to see why
the case was dropped.

06:57.605 --> 06:59.739
God, we were almost the same age.

06:59.774 --> 07:02.475
We could've been friends.

07:02.510 --> 07:04.978
You know, they have a few
speakeasies in the South Village.

07:05.012 --> 07:06.947
It's a new thing.

07:06.981 --> 07:09.683
You walk in through a dry cleaners
or a shoe store to get inside.

07:09.717 --> 07:11.685
Easy to miss if you're not in the know.

07:11.719 --> 07:13.286
Thanks, I'll check it out.

07:13.321 --> 07:14.888
Good.

07:14.922 --> 07:16.423
I'm glad you're looking into this.

07:16.457 --> 07:19.793
Whoever did this, he's a monster.

07:22.163 --> 07:24.164
(raspy breathing)

07:32.740 --> 07:33.907
Kelly.

07:33.941 --> 07:35.642
(groaning) Ow.

07:35.676 --> 07:36.876
Shh, shh, shh.

07:36.911 --> 07:37.978
God.

07:38.012 --> 07:39.579
Shh, shh.

07:39.614 --> 07:41.681
Still bad.

07:41.716 --> 07:43.817
What do you want?

07:45.253 --> 07:47.053
I have a plan, but I need your help.

07:47.088 --> 07:48.989
What plan?

07:52.693 --> 07:54.194
We're going to escape.

07:54.228 --> 07:57.697
I'm getting off of this hell of an island,

07:57.732 --> 07:59.733
or I'm gonna die trying.

08:02.899 --> 08:08.200
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:23.936 --> 08:25.736
Alfred?

08:28.841 --> 08:32.210
- Where are you going?
- Into the city, Master Bruce.

08:32.244 --> 08:33.611
If I know Reggie,

08:33.645 --> 08:36.179
he's probably drunk
himself half to death by now

08:36.215 --> 08:39.984
and is moving swiftly
on to the harder stuff.

08:40.018 --> 08:41.751
I'll probably find him

08:41.787 --> 08:44.722
- holed up in a shooting gallery,
- totally off his maracas.

08:44.756 --> 08:46.757
Alfred, you can't go.

08:46.792 --> 08:50.561
- You're not well.
- No choice, Master Bruce.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.296
He'll only be here for a few days.

08:52.331 --> 08:56.033
Enough time to get his
fix, then he'll be off.

08:57.669 --> 08:59.570
Well, then we better get going.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.739
If you think I'm gonna take you, Master...

09:01.774 --> 09:04.575
(gasps)

09:07.146 --> 09:09.147
(groans)

09:11.150 --> 09:13.584
Oh, dear.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.127
Good day, Lidia.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.796
Have you thought about my offer?

09:24.830 --> 09:28.266
I told you already, my
place is not for sale.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.736
Please, I beg of you, think again.

09:31.770 --> 09:34.372
I will serve strictly as a silent partner.

09:34.406 --> 09:35.606
(scoffs)

09:35.641 --> 09:37.975
You will continue to run
the day-to-day operations.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.512
<i>Che pazzo, I told you already!</i>

09:41.547 --> 09:43.314
Madam, please, I-I meant no harm.

09:43.348 --> 09:45.983
Okay, Mama. You made your point.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.086
Madam, I assure you,

09:48.120 --> 09:50.788
I have a sincere interest
in your establishment.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.825
If money is not what you seek,

09:53.859 --> 09:56.828
surely there is something you want.

09:59.731 --> 10:02.667
My granddaughter, Antonia,

10:02.701 --> 10:04.168
she's beautiful,

10:04.203 --> 10:06.537
virtuous,

10:06.572 --> 10:09.340
an angel.

10:09.374 --> 10:12.009
And she has been seduced

10:12.044 --> 10:15.179
by a silver-tongued guitar player.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.482
Lucifer himself.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.484
A tragedy.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.253
You make her come home,

10:22.287 --> 10:25.523
<i>leave this... pappone...</i>

10:28.327 --> 10:31.095
then I'll consider your offer.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.431
Madam,

10:33.465 --> 10:35.733
she will be home for Sunday Mass.

10:37.035 --> 10:38.469
You have my word.

10:43.442 --> 10:46.411
This place is a dump.
Real nickel-and-dime.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.246
It's worth far more than that, Gabe.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.281
You just don't see it yet.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.351
No.

10:53.385 --> 10:56.354
I'm not saying we officially take over the
investigation; just help me look into it.

10:56.388 --> 10:57.755
No.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.124
Harvey. The victim deserves justice.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.427
Yeah, and I deserve a mute supermodel

11:02.461 --> 11:04.595
who likes pasty Irish
guys and loves to cook.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.797
It's not happening.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.966
Besides, we both know that justice

11:09.001 --> 11:11.135
isn't the real reason you want this one.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.371
- Hello, Detectives.
- Ed, question:

11:13.405 --> 11:17.058
would you rather work more or less?

11:17.083 --> 11:19.985
- Is this a riddle?
- Exactly.

11:20.019 --> 11:21.620
You're helping. What's up?

11:21.654 --> 11:23.788
Uh, list of all establishments
in the South Village

11:23.823 --> 11:24.823
with a current liquor license.

11:24.857 --> 11:27.192
- Including speakeasies?
- Yes, siree...

11:27.226 --> 11:28.827
Four of which, you'll be pleased to know,

11:28.861 --> 11:30.729
were missed by the original detectives.

11:30.763 --> 11:31.963
Ah, that's great, Ed. Thanks.

11:31.998 --> 11:32.964
One more thing.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.332
I was going through

11:34.367 --> 11:36.134
the crime scene evidence
from the Fairchild murder

11:36.168 --> 11:39.137
and, uh, there's a piece
of evidence missing.

11:39.171 --> 11:41.706
- Any idea what it is?
- No,

11:41.741 --> 11:43.608
but it's labeled "3A."
Think you can find it?

11:43.643 --> 11:46.144
Detective, I will solve this puzzle.

11:52.618 --> 11:53.818
You coming?

11:53.853 --> 11:56.855
Let me say it in Spanish:

11:56.889 --> 11:57.889
No.

11:57.924 --> 12:00.358
Okay, look, you're right. I'm ambitious.

12:00.393 --> 12:01.993
I want to show people around here

12:02.028 --> 12:04.629
that things are gonna change.

12:04.664 --> 12:06.731
But, Harvey, I can't do
that without your help.

12:06.766 --> 12:08.099
Look, I know you're riding high,

12:08.134 --> 12:09.768
what with getting over on Loeb and all.

12:09.802 --> 12:13.238
But there's one thing you
should always remember.

12:13.272 --> 12:15.473
Fly too close to the sun,

12:15.508 --> 12:16.908
you're gonna get burned.

12:16.943 --> 12:18.109
You done?

12:18.144 --> 12:19.644
- Yeah.
- Good.

12:19.679 --> 12:20.745
Then get your ass up.

12:21.781 --> 12:23.582
(grunts)

12:25.218 --> 12:26.918
<i>MOONEY: So that's it.</i>

12:26.953 --> 12:29.855
So you're trying to tell me

12:29.889 --> 12:31.923
you actually think we can get out of here.

12:31.958 --> 12:35.227
That's what I said, didn't I?

12:35.261 --> 12:39.097
- How?
- With cunning and guile.

12:39.131 --> 12:42.167
But it won't work without your help.

12:42.201 --> 12:43.602
Well, why us?

12:43.636 --> 12:45.704
Why not your friends?

12:45.738 --> 12:48.573
There's no telling how
this is all going to go down

12:48.608 --> 12:50.008
during the breakout.

12:50.042 --> 12:52.143
Just in case it goes south,

12:52.178 --> 12:55.413
I need some stone cold killers by my side,

12:55.448 --> 12:57.015
not some whipped-ass victims.

12:57.049 --> 12:58.216
CLINT: That's fair.

12:58.251 --> 13:00.252
What's the plan?

13:00.286 --> 13:02.187
Outside, there's a boat down by the shore,

13:02.221 --> 13:04.923
big enough to carry the six
of us off of this island.

13:04.957 --> 13:06.424
A boat?

13:08.127 --> 13:09.694
You have a better idea?

13:09.729 --> 13:11.796
I heard a chopper land the other day.

13:11.831 --> 13:13.231
Thumped like a son of a bitch.

13:13.266 --> 13:14.766
Why don't we fly out of here?

13:14.800 --> 13:18.570
Do any of you know how to fly a helicopter?

13:22.475 --> 13:24.209
Mm-hmm. That's why.

13:24.243 --> 13:27.045
All right. This boat...

13:27.079 --> 13:28.470
you got the keys to it?

13:29.135 --> 13:31.803
No. Not yet, but I will.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.493
So are you in, or out?

13:38.624 --> 13:41.193
We're oh-for-three.
My dogs are barking.

13:41.227 --> 13:43.528
I'm hardly one to complain
about going to a bar,

13:43.563 --> 13:45.197
but this is getting ridiculous.

13:45.231 --> 13:47.199
It's grunt work, just like any other case.

13:47.233 --> 13:49.801
Except it's not just like any other case;

13:49.836 --> 13:51.269
it's a hobby.

13:51.304 --> 13:53.305
Everybody needs a hobby.

13:55.341 --> 13:57.776
GCPD Homicide.

13:57.810 --> 13:59.878
WOMAN: Yeah, she was in here.

13:59.912 --> 14:01.046
A while ago.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.014
Maybe... three or four months?

14:03.049 --> 14:05.150
GORDON: You remember her.

14:05.184 --> 14:07.452
Yeah, she mentioned she went
to a rival college of mine.

14:07.487 --> 14:10.355
- Plus...
- Plus what?

14:10.389 --> 14:12.224
To be honest with you, her date was hot.

14:12.258 --> 14:14.192
Her date?

14:14.227 --> 14:15.694
Remember what he looked like?

14:15.728 --> 14:18.563
Just that he was good-looking.

14:18.598 --> 14:20.632
But classy, you know?

14:23.569 --> 14:25.937
Okay. Your turn.

14:25.972 --> 14:28.140
How is

14:28.174 --> 14:30.308
a successful, funny,

14:30.343 --> 14:33.779
mildly good-looking guy
like you still single?

14:33.813 --> 14:35.847
- "Mildly"?
- Maybe a little bit

14:35.882 --> 14:37.582
more than that. Come on.

14:37.617 --> 14:39.885
Something has to be wrong with you.

14:39.919 --> 14:42.521
Maybe you're right. I've, uh...

14:42.555 --> 14:43.855
I've had plenty of relationships,

14:43.890 --> 14:46.258
but in the end, they...

14:46.292 --> 14:48.827
never seem to work out.

14:48.861 --> 14:50.896
Why not?

14:50.930 --> 14:53.498
I think what I'm looking
for frightens people.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.002
Uh... okay.

14:57.036 --> 14:58.904
No, it's... (laughs)

14:58.938 --> 15:01.773
- It's nothing weird.
- What, then?

15:03.368 --> 15:05.077
It's gonna sound cheesy.

15:05.111 --> 15:08.947
I won't laugh. I promise.

15:08.981 --> 15:11.917
What I'm looking for...

15:11.951 --> 15:13.418
is unconditional love.

15:13.453 --> 15:15.687
Unconditional,

15:15.721 --> 15:20.225
real, intense love.

15:25.798 --> 15:27.232
Cheesy, right?

15:28.401 --> 15:30.402
Totally.

15:36.609 --> 15:38.310
(door opens)

15:38.344 --> 15:39.845
(door closes)

15:40.913 --> 15:42.381
GRACE: Wow.

15:43.950 --> 15:46.785
- You like it?
- It'll do.

15:46.819 --> 15:49.454
There's some wine in the kitchen.

15:49.489 --> 15:51.456
Open anything you like.

15:51.491 --> 15:52.791
May I take your jacket?

16:06.339 --> 16:08.507
This place must work well.

16:08.541 --> 16:10.976
What do you mean?

16:11.010 --> 16:12.644
With the women that you bring back here.

16:12.678 --> 16:14.046
(laughs)

16:14.080 --> 16:15.180
Actually, it's...

16:15.214 --> 16:18.250
been a while since I've had anyone over.

16:18.284 --> 16:20.285
Hmm.

16:22.188 --> 16:24.790
- Lucky me.
- I'm the lucky one.

16:24.824 --> 16:28.193
Thank you for taking a chance on me.

16:28.227 --> 16:29.995
Are you kidding me?

16:30.029 --> 16:31.463
Look at this place.

16:31.497 --> 16:33.598
I could definitely stay here...

16:33.633 --> 16:36.868
for a night.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.342
Look, if he, uh, comes back in

16:44.377 --> 16:47.512
or you think of anything
else, give me a call.

16:47.547 --> 16:48.880
Sure.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.652
He was right here, Harvey.

16:53.686 --> 16:55.487
Yeah.

16:55.521 --> 16:56.988
You're not dropping this one, are you?

16:58.524 --> 17:00.025
Not a chance.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.461
(clock ticking)

17:23.246 --> 17:24.978
_

18:00.293 --> 18:01.961
So...

18:01.995 --> 18:03.662
are we in agreement?

18:03.697 --> 18:05.231
Not quite.

18:05.265 --> 18:07.066
Says he still loves the girl.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.367
He won't leave her.

18:08.401 --> 18:11.070
Antonia and I are destined to be together,

18:11.104 --> 18:13.606
and nothing you can do

18:13.640 --> 18:15.441
will make me stop loving her.

18:15.475 --> 18:18.110
See what I mean? True love.

18:18.144 --> 18:19.378
You want me to put a slug in him,

18:19.412 --> 18:20.646
see if that loosens him up?

18:20.680 --> 18:23.182
No.

18:23.216 --> 18:24.550
He's a guitar player.

18:25.986 --> 18:27.353
Lose the fingers.

18:27.387 --> 18:28.888
You want me to shoot his fingers?

18:28.922 --> 18:30.623
Don't shoot them.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.793
Lose them.

18:36.997 --> 18:38.664
(man screams)

18:38.698 --> 18:40.699
(scream echoes and fades)

18:44.538 --> 18:47.006
(door opens)

18:47.040 --> 18:48.507
Just the man I wanted to see.

18:48.542 --> 18:50.476
Oh, don't say that.

18:50.510 --> 18:51.844
You're gonna make Jim jealous.

18:51.878 --> 18:54.346
I finished the Fairchild autopsy

18:54.381 --> 18:55.681
and the results were a little strange.

18:55.715 --> 18:56.849
Strange how?

18:56.883 --> 19:00.419
Grace Fairchild was missing
for over four months.

19:00.453 --> 19:01.887
Usually, with these kind of abductions,

19:01.922 --> 19:03.556
there's a lot of trauma
and abuse to the body,

19:03.590 --> 19:04.857
but not this time.

19:04.891 --> 19:07.593
Other than the stab wounds
to her heart and her throat,

19:07.627 --> 19:09.195
her body was mostly pristine.

19:11.164 --> 19:12.731
That doesn't add up.

19:12.766 --> 19:14.066
Unless...

19:15.468 --> 19:16.702
Unless what?

19:16.736 --> 19:18.871
You ever consider she ran off on her own?

19:18.905 --> 19:20.673
That her going missing has nothing to do

19:20.707 --> 19:22.208
with her murder?

19:22.242 --> 19:24.844
The findings would certainly support that.

19:24.878 --> 19:26.478
Maybe.

19:30.383 --> 19:32.451
No.

19:32.485 --> 19:34.620
No, Fairchild had a good job,

19:34.654 --> 19:35.955
a mortgage...

19:35.989 --> 19:37.423
Hell, she called her mother

19:37.457 --> 19:39.091
the night she went missing.

19:39.125 --> 19:42.361
No, she didn't run away. She was taken.

19:42.395 --> 19:46.765
And whoever took her kept her locked away

19:46.800 --> 19:49.401
till he was good and ready...

19:49.436 --> 19:51.437
and then he killed her.

19:53.073 --> 19:54.573
I know it.

20:01.681 --> 20:03.949
(car honks in distance)

20:07.687 --> 20:09.021
Morning.

20:09.055 --> 20:10.589
How'd you sleep?

20:10.624 --> 20:12.458
Like a baby.

20:16.363 --> 20:17.663
So I thought, after breakfast,

20:17.697 --> 20:19.732
we could go to the, uh, Palick exhibit.

20:19.766 --> 20:21.333
It's only in town another week.

20:21.368 --> 20:22.401
Oh...

20:22.435 --> 20:25.004
I would love to, really,
but I am already late,

20:25.038 --> 20:27.173
and I've got a morning
meeting and a work lunch.

20:27.207 --> 20:29.608
- So reschedule it.
- I can't.

20:29.643 --> 20:32.478
I had a really good
time with you last night.

20:32.512 --> 20:34.980
And I hope that

20:35.015 --> 20:36.916
I get to see you again.

20:36.950 --> 20:39.518
At least, uh... have some breakfast.

20:39.553 --> 20:41.687
Oh, I still have to go home and change

20:41.721 --> 20:42.988
and I am so late.

20:43.023 --> 20:44.156
Next time.

20:51.331 --> 20:53.399
Call me tonight.

20:53.433 --> 20:56.168
I can come over after work,

20:56.203 --> 20:59.038
if you want.

21:05.745 --> 21:07.913
Oh, Jason...

21:07.948 --> 21:09.548
please, I really have to go.

21:11.551 --> 21:13.152
No.

21:14.821 --> 21:16.555
You don't.

21:19.392 --> 21:21.393
(birds squawking)

21:35.342 --> 21:36.809
(creaking)

22:19.886 --> 22:21.253
(door handle rattles)

22:25.892 --> 22:27.560
Miss Mooney.

22:31.431 --> 22:33.099
What a surprise.

22:41.949 --> 22:44.183
Is there something I can do for you?

22:44.218 --> 22:46.203
FISH: Well...

22:46.241 --> 22:48.976
supplies were running low...

22:49.011 --> 22:50.645
for the inmates.

22:50.679 --> 22:52.380
Those are in the storage room.

22:53.749 --> 22:56.417
But then, of course, you already knew that.

22:58.087 --> 23:01.723
The one thing I won't tolerate...

23:01.757 --> 23:03.424
is dishonesty.

23:06.528 --> 23:08.496
You were trying to escape, weren't you?

23:08.530 --> 23:09.564
No.

23:10.933 --> 23:12.900
I'll tell you what.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.902
I'm going to shoot you in the stomach.

23:14.937 --> 23:16.871
You'll feel pressure at first.

23:16.905 --> 23:19.107
Then you'll feel an intense burning

23:19.141 --> 23:21.109
like you've never felt in your life.

23:21.143 --> 23:23.111
Maybe that will properly motivate you

23:23.145 --> 23:24.946
to be honest with me.

23:24.980 --> 23:27.281
I ask you again.

23:27.316 --> 23:29.450
Were you trying to escape?

23:32.221 --> 23:34.188
No.

23:34.223 --> 23:36.357
How disappointing.

23:36.392 --> 23:38.626
Wait, s-stop. Wait, wait.

23:38.661 --> 23:42.430
I was lying, but I... but
I wasn't trying to escape.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.265
You were going to kill me?

23:44.300 --> 23:45.933
Slit my throat, perhaps?

23:47.136 --> 23:49.103
No, I swear.

23:49.138 --> 23:51.105
Not yours...

23:51.140 --> 23:53.141
Not yours.

23:56.512 --> 24:01.149
Every night when I close
my eyes, I pray to God

24:01.183 --> 24:05.153
that nightmare doesn't come.

24:05.187 --> 24:09.490
That... living, breathing man,

24:09.525 --> 24:14.095
stitched together with...
arms and legs that weren't his.

24:14.129 --> 24:17.665
That nightmare you created.

24:17.700 --> 24:21.669
I've faced dangerous men,

24:21.704 --> 24:24.372
but none like you,

24:24.406 --> 24:27.075
Dollmaker.

24:27.109 --> 24:29.744
So you'd rather take your own life

24:29.778 --> 24:31.813
than end up one of my creations?

24:31.847 --> 24:33.615
Yes.

24:36.485 --> 24:38.786
Well, Miss Mooney,

24:38.821 --> 24:41.456
try anything like this again,

24:41.490 --> 24:43.958
and your nightmare will come true.

24:43.993 --> 24:46.794
I will bring you back from
the dead, if I have to...

24:49.031 --> 24:51.799
and make you into something
the world has never seen.

24:58.172 --> 24:59.691
Was there something else?

25:02.845 --> 25:04.846
No.

25:25.067 --> 25:27.368
Could've smashed your head
with a brick, you know?

25:27.403 --> 25:29.070
Why would you do that?

25:29.104 --> 25:31.072
Why'd you even say that?

25:31.106 --> 25:33.041
Just thought you should know. What's up?

25:33.075 --> 25:35.043
Why're you looking for me?

25:35.077 --> 25:37.045
Reggie Payne, the man who stabbed Alfred,

25:37.079 --> 25:38.513
he's in Gotham.

25:38.547 --> 25:41.049
And you need my help to find him. Okay.

25:42.585 --> 25:45.219
Alfred said he'd be at a
gun range for a few days,

25:45.254 --> 25:46.888
but I checked every one in the city.

25:46.922 --> 25:48.523
Nothing.

25:48.557 --> 25:51.192
Who stays at a gun range for a few days?

25:51.226 --> 25:54.862
- Doesn't make any sense.
- That's what he said.

25:54.897 --> 25:56.864
Said Reggie'd be at a shooting gallery.

25:56.899 --> 26:00.101
That's not the same as a gun range, silly.

26:01.470 --> 26:03.471
You really need to get out more.

26:08.143 --> 26:10.445
(weeping)

26:12.381 --> 26:14.382
All right, all right, all right.

26:18.821 --> 26:20.655
- Go get yourself cleaned up.
- (door opens, bell jingles)

26:22.758 --> 26:24.425
Back in a minute.

26:32.635 --> 26:35.970
So shall we discuss terms?

26:39.775 --> 26:42.477
- So what is it?
- Well, to be clear,

26:42.511 --> 26:43.811
this isn't an actual piece
of crime scene evidence.

26:43.846 --> 26:45.246
It's long gone, as far as I can tell.

26:45.281 --> 26:47.582
What I was able to find is a photocopy,

26:47.616 --> 26:49.250
buried deep in a logbook.

26:49.285 --> 26:50.885
It's a broken heart.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.487
Hand-painted, I'd guess.

26:55.858 --> 26:57.559
This was at the crime scene?

26:58.794 --> 27:00.261
You're sure?

27:00.296 --> 27:01.596
Well, not this, exactly.

27:01.630 --> 27:03.498
You see, a photocopy is a replica...

27:03.532 --> 27:05.633
Damn it, no, Ed, not now.

27:05.668 --> 27:07.602
What's wrong? I warned you.

27:07.636 --> 27:11.105
But no, you had to go
and get both of us burned.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.607
What are you talking about?

27:12.641 --> 27:15.810
This guy you're after,
this is not his first rodeo.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.812
He's a serial killer.

27:21.350 --> 27:22.984
This looks delicious.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.419
Thank you.

27:25.788 --> 27:29.424
I, uh... I think I may have

27:29.458 --> 27:32.293
overcooked the lamb... a little bit,

27:32.328 --> 27:33.962
but I-I, uh...

27:33.996 --> 27:35.330
I'm sure it's fine.

27:37.132 --> 27:38.433
How was your day?

27:38.467 --> 27:41.135
Wonderful, darling.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.976
And how was yours?

27:50.045 --> 27:51.679
Good.

27:51.714 --> 27:53.381
Thank you for asking.

27:57.820 --> 27:59.153
Mmm.

28:13.936 --> 28:16.204
I think you might have been right...

28:16.238 --> 28:17.906
about the lamb.

28:19.742 --> 28:21.709
I'm so sorry.

28:21.744 --> 28:23.845
It's fine.

28:23.879 --> 28:25.947
I checked it twice when it was in the oven,

28:25.981 --> 28:28.483
and I think it might be
hotter than it says it is...

28:29.251 --> 28:30.919
(whimpers)

28:35.124 --> 28:37.759
You know...

28:37.793 --> 28:40.428
(sighs)

28:40.462 --> 28:42.864
I don't think this is working out.

28:42.898 --> 28:44.999
(shuddering gasp)

28:45.034 --> 28:47.035
It's not you.

28:50.372 --> 28:52.373
It's me.

28:53.576 --> 28:55.543
(camera shutter clicking)

28:55.578 --> 28:57.579
(shuddering breath)

29:08.958 --> 29:10.925
Could have had something special.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.261
GRACE: Please. Please don't hurt me.

29:13.295 --> 29:16.297
You know, I really
thought you were the one.

29:21.971 --> 29:23.938
GRACE: Please.

29:23.973 --> 29:25.940
(breathing rapidly): No, no.

29:25.975 --> 29:29.611
Don't worry. Sooner or
later, I'll find her.

29:29.645 --> 29:31.312
(Grace gasps desperately)

29:40.208 --> 29:42.843
I still don't get it.

29:42.877 --> 29:45.179
Why all that trouble
for this pile of bricks?

29:45.213 --> 29:47.514
This was never about money, Gabe.

29:47.549 --> 29:50.851
Not about money? What else is there?

29:50.885 --> 29:52.853
All kinds of things motivate people...

29:52.887 --> 29:56.523
Lust, ambition, envy.

29:56.558 --> 29:59.193
Okay, what motivated you?

29:59.227 --> 30:01.862
Why do you want this place so bad?

30:01.896 --> 30:03.230
It's simple.

30:05.567 --> 30:07.901
This is where I'm gonna kill Don Maroni.

30:10.005 --> 30:12.539
(birds squawking)

30:17.379 --> 30:18.679
It's time.

30:18.713 --> 30:21.382
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

30:35.263 --> 30:37.898
Now, as soon as this door
opens, an alarm will go off,

30:37.933 --> 30:39.567
and we will not have much time.

30:39.601 --> 30:41.902
- What about the gate?
- Unlocked last night.

30:41.937 --> 30:43.237
Take these.

30:43.271 --> 30:45.239
Get the boat started as
soon as you get there.

30:45.273 --> 30:46.774
You're not coming with us?

30:46.808 --> 30:49.310
I'm coming, I'll be right
back... I need to get Kelly.

30:49.344 --> 30:51.245
He can barely walk. Let's go.

30:51.279 --> 30:52.780
Call me sentimental,

30:52.814 --> 30:54.448
but I cannot leave him here.

30:56.618 --> 30:58.252
(alarm blaring)

30:58.286 --> 31:01.622
And you better not leave me.

31:27.983 --> 31:29.917
You lied to me, Fish.

31:33.221 --> 31:35.556
I warned you what would
happen if you lied to me.

31:37.225 --> 31:41.762
Oh, what wonders I'm
gonna make of your parts.

31:41.796 --> 31:43.797
(gate creaking)

31:51.706 --> 31:53.841
(grunting)

31:53.875 --> 31:56.477
- (blows landing)
- See you around, Doc.

31:56.511 --> 31:59.146
Leave him there. We don't have much time.

31:59.180 --> 32:00.180
(claps once) Let's go.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.521
(alarm blaring)

32:10.892 --> 32:12.192
This way.

32:12.227 --> 32:14.361
They're headed for the boat.

32:24.205 --> 32:26.006
What are you doing, man? Open up the gate.

32:26.041 --> 32:28.142
I can't. It's locked.

32:28.176 --> 32:30.311
What? Fish said she unlocked it.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.314
(alarm continues blaring)

32:33.348 --> 32:36.016
- That bitch.
- What?

32:37.552 --> 32:39.186
Fish.

32:39.221 --> 32:41.188
She set us up.

32:43.959 --> 32:45.960
(grunts)

32:53.802 --> 32:54.869
Kelly, other side!

32:54.903 --> 32:56.904
(excited chattering)

32:58.907 --> 33:01.242
You told them you couldn't fly, didn't you?

33:01.276 --> 33:02.543
I lied.

33:20.495 --> 33:22.663
The chopper.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.600
Hold on!

33:39.347 --> 33:41.315
- Aah!
- Fish!

33:47.455 --> 33:49.323
(huffing)

33:53.662 --> 33:55.663
(gasping)

34:01.819 --> 34:04.279
He abducts young, single, attractive women

34:04.305 --> 34:06.373
and he keeps them sometimes for a week,

34:06.408 --> 34:08.175
sometimes for months.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.978
Then he dumps their bodies around Gotham.

34:11.012 --> 34:14.248
- How many has he killed?
- A dozen, maybe more.

34:14.282 --> 34:15.649
Every time he makes a kill,

34:15.683 --> 34:17.650
he leaves one of these at the crime scene.

34:17.685 --> 34:18.918
It's his calling card.

34:18.953 --> 34:22.656
- So, who is he?
- No one knows.

34:22.690 --> 34:25.292
Thinking is he's educated,
decent-looking, rich.

34:25.326 --> 34:27.293
But that's just a profile.

34:27.328 --> 34:29.429
Some of the guys call
him The Don Juan Killer.

34:29.464 --> 34:31.498
Most call him The Ogre.

34:31.533 --> 34:34.467
So, why haven't I heard
about this guy before?

34:34.502 --> 34:36.270
Why hasn't the public?

34:36.304 --> 34:38.105
- It's the GCPD's...
- Hey, fellas!

34:39.541 --> 34:41.341
Dirty little secret.

34:41.376 --> 34:43.043
Only a handful of senior detectives

34:43.078 --> 34:44.511
know anything about this guy,

34:44.545 --> 34:46.347
and they sure as hell ain't
leaking it to the press.

34:46.380 --> 34:49.149
- Why not?
- Because The Ogre retaliates

34:49.184 --> 34:51.150
against any cop who investigates him.

34:51.186 --> 34:54.054
He kills the people they love.

34:54.089 --> 34:56.857
That's why this lunatic
hasn't been caught yet, Jim,

34:56.891 --> 34:59.827
because no one's been
stupid enough to investigate.

35:02.197 --> 35:03.897
Until I came along.

35:03.932 --> 35:06.533
Which makes me wonder
how did you catch this?

35:06.568 --> 35:09.203
I told you a fellow officer
asked me to look into it.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.905
Who? Which one?

35:17.445 --> 35:18.979
(indistinct chatter nearby)

35:19.014 --> 35:21.749
(man coughing nearby)

35:26.087 --> 35:28.889
(indistinct chatter)

35:33.625 --> 35:35.929
Hey.

35:35.964 --> 35:37.965
That's him.

35:42.837 --> 35:44.838
(siren wailing nearby)

35:52.280 --> 35:53.614
(grunts)

35:55.216 --> 35:57.217
(grunting)

35:58.899 --> 36:02.122
Relax, old man. We're not gonna rob you.

36:02.157 --> 36:04.958
- What are you doing here?
- Came to talk to you.

36:04.993 --> 36:07.294
- Who's she?
- Never mind.

36:07.329 --> 36:10.831
- Who sent you to my house?
- Who sent me?

36:10.865 --> 36:14.201
Just go home... go on, Bruce.

36:14.235 --> 36:16.270
You'll be in more trouble
than you are already.

36:16.304 --> 36:19.340
Hey! That's my medicine! Give me that!

36:19.374 --> 36:21.942
My friend just asked you a question.

36:21.977 --> 36:25.946
- I said give me that.
- Or you'll what? Huh?

36:28.838 --> 36:30.317
Hey!

36:30.352 --> 36:32.119
- Don't...
- Answer the question!

36:36.324 --> 36:38.993
I didn't mean any harm.

36:39.027 --> 36:42.296
I was just supposed to take some documents.

36:42.330 --> 36:45.065
But Alfred walked in...

36:45.100 --> 36:47.401
Is he all right?

36:49.204 --> 36:52.095
- Is he?
- You stabbed him.

36:53.642 --> 36:57.111
- What do you care?
- I care!

36:57.145 --> 36:58.545
He's all right, isn't he?

36:59.614 --> 37:01.515
Who sent you?

37:04.435 --> 37:06.720
Throw them out!

37:06.755 --> 37:09.023
- No!
- Tell me who sent you!

37:10.959 --> 37:12.226
Who sent you?

37:12.260 --> 37:15.763
You shouldn't be doing this, Bruce.

37:15.797 --> 37:19.433
Only Alfie can deal with these people.

37:19.467 --> 37:20.935
What people?

37:24.272 --> 37:26.340
There's a woman named Mathis

37:26.374 --> 37:29.176
and a guy called Bunderslaw.

37:29.210 --> 37:32.112
Sid Bunderslaw... He's
the guy I dealt with.

37:32.147 --> 37:36.050
But you've got, you've got to
let Alfie take care of this.

37:36.084 --> 37:39.387
Not you, Bruce. It's
not business for a child.

37:39.487 --> 37:42.289
This man Bunderslaw...

37:42.324 --> 37:43.691
what did he want?

37:43.725 --> 37:46.193
Just to know what you knew.

37:46.227 --> 37:47.528
To see how far

37:47.562 --> 37:50.431
your investigation had gone.

37:50.465 --> 37:53.500
But he was scared.

37:53.535 --> 37:55.669
And that's why he sent me.

37:55.704 --> 37:58.238
Now, can I have my bag back, please?

37:58.273 --> 37:59.940
Please?

38:02.010 --> 38:04.445
Give it back to him.

38:20.495 --> 38:21.662
You.

38:21.696 --> 38:25.432
You're a sick man, Mr. Payne.

38:25.467 --> 38:27.101
You need help.

38:27.135 --> 38:30.604
Don't you patronize me.

38:30.639 --> 38:33.207
I may have vices, yeah,

38:33.241 --> 38:35.242
but I'm a professional.

38:37.078 --> 38:40.247
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

38:40.282 --> 38:44.151
Because he'll come after you.

38:44.185 --> 38:46.654
And there's nothing that you can do

38:46.688 --> 38:48.322
to stop him!

38:48.356 --> 38:51.325
You're just silly

38:51.359 --> 38:53.360
little children.

38:55.030 --> 38:58.132
I'm gonna tell on you.

39:06.174 --> 39:08.676
(grunting)

39:15.884 --> 39:17.651
No, you won't!

39:17.686 --> 39:19.920
(Payne screaming)

39:45.881 --> 39:47.615
It wa... it wa... it wasn't my idea!

39:47.649 --> 39:49.216
I swear!

39:49.251 --> 39:51.018
I-I was ordered to get
you to take the case.

39:51.052 --> 39:54.388
- Ordered by who?!
- Loeb!

39:54.422 --> 39:56.423
It was Commissioner Loeb.

40:01.229 --> 40:03.430
He told me to tell you that...

40:03.465 --> 40:05.666
I looked up to you.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.701
That you inspired me.

40:07.736 --> 40:09.136
I mean, he-he told me to say

40:09.170 --> 40:11.705
that I wanted to help clean up Gotham.

40:11.740 --> 40:14.975
And, uh, the GCPD. And that this case...

40:15.010 --> 40:18.112
this case was part of that.

40:18.146 --> 40:20.848
He knew you couldn't say no.

40:22.284 --> 40:25.419
And so you followed
orders like a good soldier.

40:25.453 --> 40:28.122
I-I didn't have a choice.

40:28.156 --> 40:31.292
You know what Loeb can do.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.931
All too well.

40:39.167 --> 40:40.868
Jim, listen! You're still
in the clear on this.

40:40.902 --> 40:42.703
"In the clear"? He could come after Lee!

40:42.737 --> 40:45.206
Only if he thinks you're investigating him.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.273
Think about it.

40:46.308 --> 40:48.576
It's not on your docket.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.044
There's been no press
linking you up to this case.

40:50.078 --> 40:51.378
Hell, all you've done is ask some questions

40:51.413 --> 40:52.980
so you got to drop it now!

40:53.014 --> 40:55.316
This is no time to be a hero.

40:55.350 --> 40:57.251
If I drop it, I'm letting
a serial killer go free.

40:57.285 --> 40:59.453
The blood of his next
victim is on my hands!

40:59.487 --> 41:01.255
If you don't drop it,
that blood could be Lee's.

41:02.791 --> 41:04.291
(phone line ringing)

41:04.326 --> 41:05.860
THOMPKINS (recording):
Hi, you've reached Lee.

41:05.894 --> 41:07.161
Go ahead and leave a message.

41:07.195 --> 41:08.229
(beeps)

41:08.263 --> 41:12.066
Lee, call me as soon as
you can. It's very import...

41:16.171 --> 41:18.005
(indistinct chatter)

41:18.039 --> 41:20.774
You! You son of a bitch!

41:20.809 --> 41:22.822
- Excuse me!
- You set me up!

41:22.884 --> 41:24.084
Detective, I don't know what you think...

41:24.119 --> 41:25.219
Don't talk. Listen.

41:25.253 --> 41:27.121
- Hey!
- Back off!

41:27.155 --> 41:29.423
Don't you...

41:29.457 --> 41:31.892
I tried to work with you.

41:31.926 --> 41:35.195
But now you crossed a line.

41:35.230 --> 41:39.133
You come after the one I love.

41:39.167 --> 41:41.468
From here on, we're playing my way.

41:41.503 --> 41:44.305
