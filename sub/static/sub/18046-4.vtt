-[grunts]
-[gate creaking]

00:58.892 --> 01:02.729
[Marco] I didn't find anything.
No agents, no exit, nothing.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.438
What about food?

01:04.982 --> 01:06.775
Fuck, I'm hungry.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.987
What time is breakfast?
I'm no good without breakfast.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.948
[Rafael]
That doesn't do anything. I already tried.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.492
I already tried, Marco.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.618
[creaking]

01:19.788 --> 01:20.831
See?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.876
-Congratulations!
-How could your family stand you?

01:24.960 --> 01:28.297
The question is,
how could I stand them. Trust me.

01:53.739 --> 01:54.573
[woman] Marco!

01:56.241 --> 01:57.659
Marco!

01:59.036 --> 01:59.995
Marco, come eat.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.219
A little more...

02:20.557 --> 02:22.517
-Take some more.
-No.

02:22.601 --> 02:26.480
What are you talking about, boy?
You are the one who needs to eat.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.065
You need to bulk up.

02:28.148 --> 02:32.319
Show the Process that you're better
than those bums out there.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.539
Your birthday present.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.251
-You already got me a present.
-This one isn't from me.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.088
When your parents left me
to take care of you,

02:51.171 --> 02:52.422
they gave me this letter.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.384
They told me to give it to you
on your 20th birthday.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.348
It's your last birthday here.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.477
Soon, your picture will be
up on the wall with theirs.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.606
You'll be on the Offshore, Marco.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.086
Go get everyone.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.589
I know what we need to do
to get out of here.

CHAPTER 04
GATE

04:47.871 --> 04:50.457
-How are we doing?
-Good.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.793
Six hours in.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.253
It looks like Marco figured out the panel.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.715
-[Álvaro] Confirming expectations.
-Really? Interesting.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.678
Are we really supposed
to just wait around?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.597
-And for how long?
-I don't know.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.935
Being stuck here as a couple
like you two can't be that bad.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.520
-What?
-[girl chuckles]

05:11.603 --> 05:15.315
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-It's the Process. This must be a test.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.902
Yeah, but what kind of test?
Do they want us to wait? Escape...?

05:18.985 --> 05:21.738
If the Process locked me up here,
I'm happy to stay.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.533
So if the Process told you
to eat shit, you would?

05:24.616 --> 05:27.619
If it smelled good
and it came from the Offshore...

05:27.702 --> 05:30.413
-[scoffs]
-Gross! Are you serious?

05:31.373 --> 05:34.835
Hey. Let's go up front.
Marco's calling everyone.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.253
I knew he'd figure it out.

05:39.506 --> 05:44.678
Here's the deal.
This screen shows 64 zeros and ones.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.721
The same number of levers in this dorm.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.516
Eight rooms, eight levers,
eight times eight.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.601
These numbers are instructions.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.853
-Instructions for what?
-To do handstands.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.897
We need to form groups.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.316
Who's got a good memory?

06:00.110 --> 06:01.486
[silent counting]

06:02.862 --> 06:05.031
[Marco]
<i>We'll need a group of eight memorizers.</i>

06:05.115 --> 06:08.243
Each one will memorize a line
and take it to the corresponding room.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.084
One-zero-one-one
zero-zero-zero-one. Go!

06:16.209 --> 06:18.545
[Marco]
<i>Pullers will be waiting in each room.</i>

06:18.628 --> 06:22.424
<i>When they get the sequence,</i>
<i>they'll move the levers.</i>

06:22.507 --> 06:24.593
<i>"Zero" means up, "one" means down.</i>

06:25.218 --> 06:27.387
It's not easy. They are very hard to pull.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.391
Go! Zero-one-one, zero-one-one,
zero-one!

06:32.517 --> 06:34.853
Zero-zero-one, zero-zero-one
zero-zero.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.024
[Marco] <i>We have to do this</i>
<i>in all eight rooms, at the same time.</i>

06:39.107 --> 06:42.527
And we need to finish before
a new sequence pops up on the screen.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.030
Go! Go!

06:46.156 --> 06:47.907
Everyone together! Run!

06:49.034 --> 06:51.286
Zero-zero-one-one
zero-one-zero-one.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.372
-What?
-Zero-zero-one-one-zero-one-zero-one.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.624
Got it!

06:56.875 --> 06:58.585
[Marco] <i>It's a strategy test.</i>

06:58.668 --> 07:01.546
Everyone has to do their part.
Everyone has to participate.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.465
That's what the Process wants.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.762
-[woman] Go, go, go!
-Let's go! Focus!

07:08.845 --> 07:10.555
Everyone together! Go!

07:10.639 --> 07:12.933
[Marco] <i>Run, go! Go!</i>

07:19.105 --> 07:21.316
-[thunk]
-[all cheering]

07:21.399 --> 07:22.776
Yeah!

07:23.276 --> 07:25.737
-Yeah, Marco!
-[excited chatter]

07:26.071 --> 07:27.447
Open it, open it!

07:27.530 --> 07:29.199
Yeah, Marco! It worked!

07:29.282 --> 07:31.993
Ah, they did it on their first try.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.745
Marco is clearly the leader.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.457
He took on the leadership role
and organized the group without conflict.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.585
Not that this makes a difference,
but he's my favorite candidate.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.253
[Ezequiel] It's a good start.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.465
I want to see what their plan is
for the division.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.636
Water... and food!

07:50.345 --> 07:52.555
So, we're gonna be stuck in this hole.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.683
It looks like it.
I was expecting a key or something.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.228
Magrão, go check on the gate.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.360
[Magrão struggles against gate]

08:13.493 --> 08:16.830
-[woman] Oh, no.
-At least we're not gonna starve.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.291
But look at the size of that.
It's not enough to feed a bird.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.253
So, who gets the first kit?

08:25.296 --> 08:28.466
I solved the problem,
organized everyone and I'm hungry.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.510
Anyone disagree?

08:33.596 --> 08:34.431
I disagree.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.267
If we hadn't pulled the levers,
there wouldn't be any food.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.980
Yeah. What about us? If we hadn't
memorized it all correctly,

08:42.063 --> 08:44.399
-the levers would be useless.
-That makes sense...

08:44.482 --> 08:46.651
Hold on! Those levers are heavy.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.069
[all shouting]

08:48.153 --> 08:49.863
Silence! Silence!

08:49.946 --> 08:50.780
Silence!

08:50.864 --> 08:52.532
-Put your finger down.
-Shut up.

08:52.615 --> 08:56.411
-Let's do it alphabetically.
-Alphabetically? No way! Shut up.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.497
Why are you whining?
Just because your name starts with "R"?

08:59.581 --> 09:03.626
Guys, look, everyone's role is crucial.
That's why the test exists.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.086
Alphabetical order is fair.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.047
Everyone will get their turn.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.133
It's better than wasting time arguing.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.184
Fine, Michele. Alphabetically it is.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.312
Ágata, you're first.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.732
-[Magrão] Hurry, I wanna eat.
-[Marco] Okay, guys! Take your places.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.151
The faster we do this,
the sooner we'll eat.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.402
Let's go! Quickly!

09:29.903 --> 09:31.780
Ágata, memorize it.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.490
[Marco] Let's go! Let's go!

09:52.342 --> 09:56.638
[computer voice] <i>Ezequiel's room.</i>
<i>Access granted by Councilor Matheus.</i>

10:07.357 --> 10:10.568
<i>User Ezequiel, confirm fingerprint.</i>

10:31.131 --> 10:32.841
UNAUTHORIZED FINGERPRINT

10:35.009 --> 10:36.594

10:38.721 --> 10:39.848

-[footsteps in hallway]
-[door beeps]

10:53.111 --> 10:54.487
Aline, stop.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.782
You owe Ezequiel an explanation.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.701
Don't say anything.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.370
Just follow me.

11:08.751 --> 11:13.298
Let's go, let's go! [clapping]
Focus! Everyone together!

11:13.381 --> 11:14.591
Let's go!

11:15.300 --> 11:16.259
Go!

11:20.722 --> 11:24.100
-Hey!
-One-zero-one-one zero-zero-zero-one.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.643
Go! Quickly!

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
[Marco] Go! That's it!

11:42.493 --> 11:43.995
Quickly! Quickly!

11:46.915 --> 11:49.417
Zero-zero-one-one
zero-one-zero-one.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.962
-Zero-zero-one...
-One-zero-zero-zero-one, go!

12:04.432 --> 12:06.225
[Marco] Let's go! Let's go! Focus!

12:06.309 --> 12:07.143
Go!

12:07.894 --> 12:09.687
Work together!

12:12.565 --> 12:13.608
There!

12:18.446 --> 12:21.699
The other one is zero-zero-one-one
zero-one-zero-zero. Go.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.494
Go, go, go, go!

12:32.460 --> 12:33.795
[Álvaro] Vanessa!

12:33.878 --> 12:34.963
What?

12:35.630 --> 12:38.967
Poor Vanessa...
she was the last one to eat.

12:39.050 --> 12:42.428
She's so skinny,
she must be about to faint.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.597
I think it's time we open the gate.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.850
How many candidates have been eliminated?

12:47.934 --> 12:52.397
None. Marco brought them together,
they were organized until the end.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.316
Everyone did their part
with very little conflict.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.652
In my opinion, Ezequiel, everyone passed.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.281
No. [sighs]

13:01.364 --> 13:05.368
Otávio? Let's make a few changes.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.216
[all panting]

13:23.261 --> 13:24.846
Did the food drop?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.850
Do you think it broke?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.227
And people still say
the Process is perfect.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.396
Enough of this.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.649
Sonia, where are you going?

13:37.859 --> 13:38.818
Sonia!

13:40.737 --> 13:42.405
What are you doing?

13:43.489 --> 13:46.034
[Marco] Let's go, let's go! Focus! Focus!

13:46.117 --> 13:48.703
-Stop! Stop, Marco!
-[Marco] Quickly, go!

13:48.786 --> 13:50.330
What are you doing? Go back to the room.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.165
It's no use. It stopped working.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.834
We're tired. Someone must have
missed a number. Go back.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.210
Ten times in a row?

13:56.294 --> 13:58.713
I don't think so.
They stopped sending us food.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.840
You don't know that. We can't stop.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.509
Dude, don't you get it? This is useless.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.595
It's true. We're just wasting energy.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.223
-It's probably night already.
-But the lights are still on.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.309
What difference does it make?
There are no windows.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.603
Lights on or off, I wanna sleep.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.563
-Yeah, let's go.
-Let's get some rest.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.608
-We'll see if it's working later.
-Yeah, let's rest.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.984
No, you don't understand.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.862
We can't stop.
This is a test. We can't give up!

14:22.945 --> 14:24.530
I'm sure about that.

14:24.614 --> 14:28.659
We can't give up! This is a...
This is a test! It's a test!

14:32.205 --> 14:33.498
Bunch of wimps.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.847
[Ágata repeating numbers softly]

14:51.432 --> 14:53.101
Ágata, what are you doing?

14:53.184 --> 14:56.771
One-zero-one-zero...

14:56.854 --> 15:00.108
one-zero-one-zero...

15:00.191 --> 15:03.277
Ágata, stop. There's no one here.
Come on.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.987
[shrieks] No!

15:05.696 --> 15:09.158
One-zero-one-zero-one...

15:10.118 --> 15:11.869
[continues counting]

15:13.663 --> 15:14.705
[sobs]

15:19.377 --> 15:21.879
Now, Otávio. Everything we've got.

[overlapping chatter]

15:41.566 --> 15:42.608
What's going on?

15:42.692 --> 15:43.776
So many!

15:45.445 --> 15:49.031
I knew the Process wouldn't let us starve!

15:49.115 --> 15:50.992
-Awesome!
-Pass it down!

15:51.075 --> 15:55.913
-[chatter, cheering]
-Easy, guys! Easy, easy, easy.

15:57.248 --> 16:00.835
-[Michele] Guys, hold on!
-[Fernando] Careful with my wheelchair!

16:00.918 --> 16:04.297
Let's get organized! I'm serious.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.009
I'm going to count the packets
and we'll split everything equally.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.635
[all shouting]

16:11.512 --> 16:16.267
If we get organized, everyone will eat.
Do you wanna leave a friend without food?

16:17.018 --> 16:20.521
-[man] I'm starving.
-Come on, guys. Give it back.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.106
[low murmurs]

16:24.025 --> 16:26.402
-[Magrão] No, no...
-Magrão, please.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.322
-[overlapping chatter]
-[man] Give it back. Give it back.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.783
[Michele] Try not to kick the food.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.911
Give me some room here, let's go.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.913
I'm putting water on this side

16:36.996 --> 16:38.331
and food on that side.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.009
Um...

16:50.593 --> 16:53.930
-I'm not questioning you, but--
-Go ahead and ask.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.432
I just want to understand
what's behind this change.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.561
I want to see how they deal
with a different situation.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.522
You get it?

17:03.648 --> 17:04.773
[Álvaro] Uh-huh.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.652
[stammers] Different situation...

17:09.319 --> 17:11.906
[Michele] Three packets per person.

17:11.989 --> 17:15.701
Guys, let's get in line, please.
Everyone on this side.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.246
That's it. Joana, here.

17:18.329 --> 17:21.624
Ágata... Take Ágata with you.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.252
What? You're not eating, big guy?

17:25.962 --> 17:28.047
Then can I take your share?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.675
I'll take that as a yes.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.261
Let me ask you something.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.681
-Really? You want to ask me?
-Yeah.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.933
You're a pain in the ass
but you're not stupid.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.060
-Thanks.
-Why did they send so much at once?

17:41.143 --> 17:45.189
-Because we're not leaving anytime soon.
-Yeah, the test has changed.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.233
We have to find a way to get out of here.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.193
That's now the goal.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.371
[gate creaking]

18:00.454 --> 18:02.665
We're gonna need a lever.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.378
I'm gonna round up some strong people
to help us out.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.176
Mm.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.554
This water tastes weird.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.764
It's probably from the Offshore.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.476
If it's from there,
it's the weird taste of purity.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.814
-[Rafael] Hey!
-Excuse us. How are you?

18:28.399 --> 18:29.942
What are you doing?

18:30.735 --> 18:33.529
Relax. We're just gonna
borrow a few things.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.448
This is fucking hard.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.868
[Marco] Everybody together.
One, two... Go!

18:38.951 --> 18:40.870
[gate creaking]

18:41.537 --> 18:44.373
-[grunting]
-It's not working.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.376
-Shut up.
-One, two, three, go!

18:51.380 --> 18:55.343
Aline has entered my room and went through
my things without my permission.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.556
<i>Ezequiel, keep in mind that Aline</i>
<i>has the Council's authority.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:04.101
Matheus, keep in mind that a spy
has no authority.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.064
<i>Think about what you're saying.</i>

19:08.147 --> 19:09.732
I'm thinking very clearly, Nair.

19:09.815 --> 19:13.110
And if you have an issue with me,
Matheus, you come here yourself.

19:13.194 --> 19:16.155
Don't ever send your minions to spy on me,
do you understand?

19:16.238 --> 19:19.283
<i>-You're crossing a line.</i>
-You've already crossed it, Matheus.

19:19.367 --> 19:23.245
Excuse me. As much as this may bother you,
I have a Process to lead.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.956
<i>-</i> [Matheus] <i>Ezequiel! Don't you dare!</i>
-Goodbye.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.875
<i>-Don't you dare!</i>
-Goodbye.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.920
Now, go, go!

19:31.003 --> 19:33.005
-Go!
-Come on, come on!

19:35.633 --> 19:37.176
Open it wider! Wider!

19:42.264 --> 19:43.641
Open it wider! Wider!

19:44.725 --> 19:46.310
Open it wider!

19:46.852 --> 19:49.063
Wedge it! Wedge the gate!

19:49.146 --> 19:50.022
Wider! Go, go!

19:50.106 --> 19:51.941
Come on, come on!

19:52.024 --> 19:54.026
-Brace it!
-There!

19:54.110 --> 19:56.278
-[all] Yeah!
-Hell, yes!

19:57.988 --> 20:00.157
Let's get out of this fucking place, bro.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.412
Who wants to do the honors?

20:05.871 --> 20:06.706
[gate creaks]

20:13.671 --> 20:15.881
So? Anyone?

20:17.341 --> 20:20.094
-I don't think I can fit.
-Me neither.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.307
[drops metal lever]

21:26.744 --> 21:27.995
[man] So?

21:29.830 --> 21:31.540
There's another gate.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.171
We'll make the opening bigger,
then open the other gate.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.508
No, it won't work. It looks like a safe.

21:40.591 --> 21:44.678
It's impossible to open.
We're not supposed to get out.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.348
-We're stuck here.
-[Magrão] Now what?

21:47.431 --> 21:48.682
I'm hungry.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.312
-My food is gone too.
-You ate all your food. For real?

21:53.395 --> 21:55.439
Yes, for real.
Working hard makes you hungry.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.234
Unbelievable.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.448
So, let's go get some more.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.173
What's up?

22:21.674 --> 22:25.052
We're working on the gate
and you're doing nothing.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.096
It's only fair that you
share your food and water.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.852
What's that?

22:34.311 --> 22:35.521
You want to take our food?

22:35.604 --> 22:38.566
Yes. That's exactly what we want.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.609
[chuckles]

22:41.402 --> 22:42.861
In your dreams.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.782
You were trying to open that gate
because you're all idiots.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.369
-That's not my problem.
-Sure it is.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.747
This is a social test, remember?
Everyone has their role.

22:54.248 --> 22:57.293
-If you won't help, your food will.
-Fuck you, Marco.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.797
You think you're better than me
just because you're playing boss?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.508
You can't tell me what to do,
you piece of shit.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.469
[Magrão] Sit down! Sit down!

23:08.220 --> 23:09.930
-[Marco grunting]
-[gasping]

23:12.975 --> 23:16.687
Let go! Let me go! [grunts]

23:16.770 --> 23:18.772
Marco, let him go!

23:18.856 --> 23:20.733
Marco! Enough, man! Enough!

23:20.816 --> 23:23.068
I'll let go when he cooperates.

23:29.283 --> 23:30.200
There...

23:32.536 --> 23:34.288
It's there. Over there.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.679
What about you guys?
Don't you want to contribute?

23:55.059 --> 23:56.810
Take everything! Let's go!

24:08.364 --> 24:10.282
-Got everything?
-Yeah.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.499
It's gonna be okay.

24:19.583 --> 24:23.879
We'll open the gate
and forget all about this.

24:35.391 --> 24:39.645
Why did you do that, Marco?
We're not gonna get that gate open.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.939
-That plan is over.
-Exactly.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.609
Don't you get it?
Only three percent will pass.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.403
The rest will be left behind.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.572
That's the idea behind the Process
and this test is no different.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.951
You know I'm right.
You stole the cube in the first test.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.495
You did what you had to do.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.706
I was stupid and it took me
too long to understand.

24:58.789 --> 25:02.918
We're not here to share.
They want to find the elite.

25:03.002 --> 25:07.256
[soft chuckle]
I'm an Álvares. I'm part of the elite.

25:10.467 --> 25:11.301
Smile, Marco.

25:15.597 --> 25:19.935
Got it.
It'll look great on the wall.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.355
-Larissa, did you get what I asked for?
-Right here.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.484
Don't take too long.
You don't wanna be late for the Process.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.449
[Marco]
<i>Just like my parents left me a letter,</i>

25:33.532 --> 25:35.659
<i>and my grandparents left them one, too,</i>

25:35.743 --> 25:38.746
<i>I leave you this letter... my son.</i>

25:38.829 --> 25:42.041
-For my son.
-Of course.

25:42.124 --> 25:46.253
[Marco] <i>We never met, but you carry</i>
<i>the name and the history of this family.</i>

25:46.837 --> 25:51.341
<i>You are an Álvares. And being one of us</i>
<i>means that we are superior.</i>

25:51.425 --> 25:54.887
<i>We are the elite and we deserve</i>
<i>to pass the Process.</i>

25:55.304 --> 25:56.513
[Larissa] Take care.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.976
[Marco]
<i>I have only one piece of advice for you:</i>

26:02.102 --> 26:04.354
<i>-take what's rightfully yours.</i>
<i>-</i> [overlapping chatter]

26:04.438 --> 26:06.315
Hand it over. Give it to me.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.318
[indistinct chatter]

26:09.860 --> 26:10.819
Let's go!

26:10.903 --> 26:13.989
Go! Go! Go, go, go!

26:14.073 --> 26:15.532
[woman sobbing]

26:19.495 --> 26:21.580
And the truth comes out.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.499
[Marco] <i> Shut up.</i>

26:24.291 --> 26:26.210
-Let's open the gate, Ezequiel.
-No.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.932
Go, go, go!

26:40.557 --> 26:41.391
Go, go!

26:41.475 --> 26:44.353
-This way.
-Let's go!

26:47.147 --> 26:48.941
[Marco] Go, go, go!

26:52.611 --> 26:54.029
-Fuck! A little warning?
-Shut up.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.489
Did you see that?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.283
I knew shit was gonna hit the fan.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.160
They're gonna steal everyone's food.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.621
-We need to do something.
-You do whatever you want.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.457
-I'm getting out of here.
-Getting out? Where to?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.251
All I know is I'm starving.

27:07.334 --> 27:11.130
I didn't come here for this shit.
Our side has enough of that already.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.430
[Marco] Go! Let's go!

27:20.848 --> 27:22.099
Come on!

27:27.771 --> 27:29.898
[Fernando]
Go back! Go back to your room!

27:29.982 --> 27:32.484
Marco and that son of a bitch Rafael
ganged up.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.987
They're stealing water and food
from everyone.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.446
We have to defend ourselves.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.824
[Marco] Go, go, let's go!

27:43.495 --> 27:46.790
-This is your new home. Let's go!
-[indistinct chatter]

27:48.876 --> 27:51.086
Juliano, if anyone tries to get out...

27:53.088 --> 27:54.047
What are you doing, man?

27:54.131 --> 27:56.842
Maintaining control
in case anyone tries anything stupid.

27:57.968 --> 27:58.844
Let's go!

27:58.927 --> 28:00.929
[Magrão] Let's fucking do this!

28:06.351 --> 28:09.563
Ezequiel, the situation
is getting out of hand.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.648
I want to see how this plays out.

28:14.484 --> 28:17.821
-[Marco] <i>It's over there. Go get it.</i>
<i>-</i> [chaotic chatter]

28:19.990 --> 28:22.868
<i>Aline, how could you have</i>
<i>let them catch you?</i>

28:22.951 --> 28:23.994
<i>You should've been more careful.</i>

28:24.077 --> 28:25.996
But I'm starting to get somewhere.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.916
<i>I had to spend political capital</i>
<i>to keep you there.</i>

28:28.999 --> 28:33.045
Matheus, I'm really very close
to succeeding.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.630
<i>I don't want "close."</i>

28:34.713 --> 28:36.965
<i>I want you to accomplish your mission,</i>

28:37.049 --> 28:38.467
<i>do you understand?</i>

29:25.097 --> 29:26.306
Ágata?

29:30.477 --> 29:31.311
Ágata?

29:52.249 --> 29:53.417
[alert beeping]

29:54.293 --> 29:55.335
Whoops.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.921
Don't do anything, okay?

30:33.415 --> 30:34.499
[grunts]

30:43.091 --> 30:45.802
[woman] Give me a beam.
Do you have an extra beam, Fernando?

30:47.012 --> 30:48.138
It's loose.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.266
-Hand me a piece of wood.
-[Fernando] Here you go.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.478
Tie it, tie it! Tie it, Camila. That's it.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.272
It's closed. Over here, are we good?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.733
-Tie it down there.
-Is there any wood left?

31:00.359 --> 31:02.611
[Magrão in distance]
Give up your food. Come on.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.739
-[Fernando] Go, go, go! Close it.
-Go, go!

31:09.951 --> 31:12.496
[Ezequiel]
The official test is only the first part.

31:13.747 --> 31:17.751
It's meant to analyze
how they organize tasks and resources.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.463
The candidates pull the levers
and the food drops.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.966
If that's the test, then we passed.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.886
Yes, but there's a problem.

31:28.678 --> 31:32.474
People assume that their work
will always be compensated,

31:32.557 --> 31:34.559
that resources are endless...

31:35.143 --> 31:36.812
and that the world is fair.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.566
But you know very well
that the world isn't fair, right, Joana?

31:45.028 --> 31:47.948
And it's at times like these
that people show their true colors.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.787
[gasping, grunting]

31:53.870 --> 31:55.872
Tell me where the food is.
Where's the food?

31:55.956 --> 31:57.416
Where's the food?

32:00.210 --> 32:01.044
Where is it?

32:08.385 --> 32:09.594
What are you hiding there?

32:12.097 --> 32:13.849
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.727
-What are you hiding there?
-Nothing.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.063
[screaming]

32:20.147 --> 32:21.523
[shouting]

32:23.775 --> 32:26.027
[panting, gasping]

32:28.113 --> 32:29.239
No! [screams]

32:31.158 --> 32:34.744
Goddamn. That's not very nice.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.169
-Apologize.
-[panting]

32:45.297 --> 32:46.506
Apologize.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.014
I'm sorry.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.734
That's not enough!

33:11.865 --> 33:14.242
We had to make an example
out of someone.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.411
Don't you understand?
This is a microsociety.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.497
There are those who rule
and those who obey!

33:21.583 --> 33:23.335
It's the natural order of the world.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.262
Help me out here!

33:37.599 --> 33:38.850
[Marco] Go!

33:47.567 --> 33:52.239
-The girl's dead, Marco. She's dead.
-She shouldn't have hidden food.

33:52.322 --> 33:58.286
-The Process wants us to keep control.
-No, you asshole. That's what you want!

33:58.370 --> 33:59.412
[screams]

34:00.288 --> 34:01.998
[man] What the fuck is going on here?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.417
[Marco] Run, Rafael. Run.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.212
You're dead, motherfucker!

34:36.157 --> 34:37.909
[Marco in distance] Motherfucker!

34:43.373 --> 34:46.960
-[panting] Michele! Michele, let me in.
-Shh!

34:47.043 --> 34:48.712
Lower your voice.
You'll draw them this way.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.380
-They're gonna kill me.
-We're not letting you in.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.967
-They're gonna kill me!
-Get out of here!

34:54.050 --> 34:56.469
It's a trick! Don't open it for him.

34:56.553 --> 34:59.306
-No, no! It's not a trick!
-Don't open it!

34:59.389 --> 35:02.559
-No! It's not!
-Rafael, lower your voice! Leave!

35:06.646 --> 35:07.897
[inaudible]

35:14.404 --> 35:15.572
Come on.

35:16.364 --> 35:19.826
-Don't let him in! No! Michele!
-[Michele] He's coming in!

35:21.369 --> 35:22.329
-Go!
-Close it!

35:22.412 --> 35:24.664
[Michele] Open up, quick!

35:26.082 --> 35:29.169
-Hold on! Easy!
-Come on, come on!

35:29.252 --> 35:31.004
[all shouting]

35:34.758 --> 35:36.259
Motherfuckers! You're gonna die!

35:37.636 --> 35:41.306
You're not going to do anything?
Can't you stop the test?

35:41.389 --> 35:43.475
-I can't.
-Why not?

35:45.226 --> 35:47.395
Because you are the ones
who did this, Joana.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.314
You let it come to this.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.652
If anyone is going to stop the test,
it has to be one of you.

35:54.861 --> 35:56.655
You, perhaps?

35:56.738 --> 35:58.948
-Me?
-You.

36:00.867 --> 36:03.745
Orphan. Abandoned.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.332
You had to learn everything on your own.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.587
You never had anything.
Yet, you survived.

36:16.132 --> 36:20.470
You probably fucked up
and had to run away.

36:23.765 --> 36:28.395
I know, Joana. You suffered,
but that has made you stronger.

36:28.478 --> 36:29.562
More prepared.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.984
You could show that you are worthy
of the Offshore and--

36:35.068 --> 36:37.112
The Offshore wasn't meant
for people like me.

36:39.948 --> 36:44.035
The Offshore was meant exactly
for people like you, Joana.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.290
[all shouting]

36:58.842 --> 37:00.802
[Ezequiel] What do you know
about the Founding Couple?

37:01.970 --> 37:03.388
They built the Offshore.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.890
They came from poverty, Joana.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.978
Discredited, treated like garbage.

37:11.271 --> 37:15.525
But they seized the opportunity to become
people of the greatest importance.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.741
-Here.
-I'm not hurting anyone.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.409
-What?
-I'm not hurting anyone.

37:24.492 --> 37:29.289
But they have no problem
hurting you or me. Take this shit!

37:30.915 --> 37:33.710
Why is the Process doing this to us?

37:35.712 --> 37:37.172
[shouting]

37:43.511 --> 37:44.763
[Ezequiel] Are you hungry?

38:02.030 --> 38:03.782
If you eat, you'll be eliminated.

38:04.574 --> 38:07.535
-What?
-It wouldn't be fair to the others.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.211
What if I don't?

38:17.045 --> 38:18.797
You finish the test.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.882
Make a difference in there,

38:20.965 --> 38:25.261
and prove to yourself
that you deserve better.

38:29.557 --> 38:30.391
Like them.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.273
Now! Go, go!

38:38.441 --> 38:39.692
[overlapping shouts]

38:39.776 --> 38:41.486
Hold on! Hold on!

38:42.445 --> 38:44.113
You're all fucked!

38:44.197 --> 38:45.240
[all shouting]

39:01.798 --> 39:04.175
[shouting continues in distance]

39:28.449 --> 39:29.784
-[Joana grunts]
-[body thuds]

39:29.868 --> 39:31.119
[overlapping shouts]

39:31.202 --> 39:35.039
Hold it! Hold it there!

39:41.296 --> 39:42.922
[Joana] They're over here!

39:43.006 --> 39:45.008
[overlapping shouts]

39:45.091 --> 39:46.467
What the hell?

39:46.885 --> 39:48.219
Motherfucker!

39:48.303 --> 39:50.263
[all shouting, screaming]

40:02.191 --> 40:04.360
[Magrão] Motherfucker! Let go of me!

40:25.673 --> 40:29.594
[Joana]
Stop! Stop! That's enough. Enough!

40:31.763 --> 40:32.597
It's over.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.692
You can come out. Come on.

41:05.672 --> 41:06.839
[siren wailing]

41:10.760 --> 41:12.929
[metal creaking]

41:16.391 --> 41:19.686
-It's open. The gate is open!
-[all cheering]

41:28.152 --> 41:30.655
-[Rafael] Go.
-[Fernando] Thank you.

41:31.781 --> 41:32.699
Go.

42:11.612 --> 42:12.655
[coughing]

42:16.075 --> 42:17.326
[grunts]

42:28.463 --> 42:30.590
[panting]

42:38.097 --> 42:39.974
[sobbing]

43:10.963 --> 43:13.633
-[device beeps]
-[alarm wailing]

43:14.550 --> 43:16.636
[gates creaking]

43:29.857 --> 43:31.651
GATES CLOSING

43:39.408 --> 43:42.662
-[bones cracking]
-[screaming]

43:42.745 --> 43:44.122
[scream echoes]

44:01.722 --> 44:03.099
What did he say to you?

44:05.434 --> 44:07.770
Rafael. What did he say
for you to let him in?

44:07.854 --> 44:10.189
Nothing. I just believed him.

44:18.614 --> 44:22.160
[Rafael] Today, little brother,
the drinks are on me. [chuckles]

44:27.832 --> 44:29.208
[brother sighs]

44:31.294 --> 44:33.171
So? Are you ready?

44:33.254 --> 44:34.755
No. [chuckles]

44:35.590 --> 44:39.135
Twenty years. When you're a kid,
it seems like it will take forever.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.598
And then, out of nowhere,
your Process is next week.

44:44.599 --> 44:48.186
-You're screwed. Totally screwed.
-Screwed.

44:52.732 --> 44:56.277
I don't know if I'm going to pass,
but I wanna make it far, like you did.

44:59.947 --> 45:03.284
-What's wrong?
-I didn't get far at all.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.996
I was eliminated right off the bat.
On the first day.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.832
But that was a year ago.

45:09.916 --> 45:10.917
It's done.

45:12.168 --> 45:13.336
Now it's your turn.

45:13.419 --> 45:15.129
Yes. It's my turn.

45:15.213 --> 45:18.382
-You will do great, Rafael.
-Thanks, Tiago.

45:22.720 --> 45:26.057
-[grunts]
-Hey... hey.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.184
Are you okay? Come on.

45:28.267 --> 45:29.936
Easy. There you go.

45:30.436 --> 45:35.233
I'm okay. I just need to
lie down for a bit. [groans]

45:38.569 --> 45:40.154
[soft snoring]

45:48.913 --> 45:50.039
I'm sorry, Rafael.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.452
Tiago.

46:29.996 --> 46:32.581
I found a way to join the Process again.

46:33.457 --> 46:34.583
A new registration.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.382
Ivana, you can trust me.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.719
This time, I won't disappoint the Cause.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.779
[Ezequiel] Welcome to the garden.

47:04.947 --> 47:08.909
Only nine percent of all candidates
get this far.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.960
Consider yourselves privileged.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.016
