WEBVTT

00:06.425 --> 00:09.060
Can you sign this for me,
please?

00:09.128 --> 00:11.463
I haven't seen
this picture in ages.

00:11.497 --> 00:12.864
Before you leave,
you have to sign off

00:12.898 --> 00:14.733
on some paperwork at reception.

00:16.168 --> 00:18.136
You better call Scott.

00:18.203 --> 00:19.704
Buckingham's dead.

00:19.739 --> 00:22.140
I'm the one
you should be firing.

00:22.174 --> 00:25.442
I let Jeremy into the clinic
the night Buckingham died.

00:25.477 --> 00:27.678
I just want you guys
to get along!

00:27.712 --> 00:29.446
<i>To be friends.</i>

00:30.749 --> 00:32.683
We'll figure it out.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:49.200 --> 00:50.601
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

00:50.635 --> 00:52.703
Come on, you can do it!

01:03.147 --> 01:04.881
That horse isn't gettin'
any younger!

01:04.916 --> 01:06.482
I know, tell me about it.

01:06.517 --> 01:07.997
I've been trying to work
on his cardio

01:08.019 --> 01:10.220
since my dad's away
in Moose Jaw.

01:10.254 --> 01:12.174
Why don't you give him a name
while you're at it?

01:12.190 --> 01:13.256
I know, right?

01:13.291 --> 01:14.957
He's had this guy
for how many years

01:14.991 --> 01:16.559
and he's never given him
a name?!

01:16.593 --> 01:17.794
I think that says
more about your dad

01:17.828 --> 01:19.061
than it does about the horse.

01:19.095 --> 01:21.631
Yeah, but it's not good
for his ego.

01:21.699 --> 01:23.232
I think your dad's got enough
ego for the both of them.

01:26.236 --> 01:28.103
Whoa! Whoa!

01:29.440 --> 01:30.640
I've gotta head back.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.875
Cassandra's having some issues
at the clinic.

01:32.943 --> 01:33.976
<i>Okay.</i>

01:34.010 --> 01:36.411
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

01:59.168 --> 02:00.435
Shane!

02:00.503 --> 02:01.770
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

02:01.838 --> 02:03.171
Yeah, sorry I had to take off
so quick.

02:03.239 --> 02:04.705
Uh, something came up
at the ranch.

02:04.773 --> 02:05.974
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:06.942 --> 02:10.277
No, it had nothing to do
with me and your mother.

02:10.346 --> 02:11.612
You heard that?!

02:11.680 --> 02:12.720
Yeah, well, you know what?

02:12.748 --> 02:15.149
Sometimes people say stuff
and it-

02:15.184 --> 02:16.417
it's not crap!

02:16.451 --> 02:18.353
You don't talk to your father
like that, Shane!

02:19.554 --> 02:20.588
Shane!

02:22.190 --> 02:24.124
Hey, Tim, wait!

02:24.192 --> 02:25.793
You got cables?
I need a boost.

02:25.861 --> 02:27.495
I don't have cables!

02:27.562 --> 02:28.529
Do I look like I have cables?!

02:28.597 --> 02:30.364
Do you see cables
hanging from me?

02:30.399 --> 02:31.665
<i>I got advice!</i>

02:31.733 --> 02:32.767
Why don't you get rid
of that piece of junk

02:32.834 --> 02:35.102
and get yourself a real truck!

02:35.136 --> 02:37.837
What are you talking about?
This is a classic!

02:37.906 --> 02:39.472
Look at that thing!
You can't pull a trailer,

02:39.507 --> 02:41.541
you can't put a load in,
you can't even start it!

02:41.609 --> 02:43.476
<i>You wanna drive around</i>
<i>with my daughter in this</i>

02:43.511 --> 02:44.945
when you're married?!

02:44.979 --> 02:46.679
Man, the world's totally changed
since I was married,

02:46.714 --> 02:48.782
I'll tell you that!

02:54.722 --> 02:56.322
Hey, grampa.

02:56.390 --> 02:58.991
There's a cold front coming in.
It's brutal up on the ridge.

02:59.026 --> 03:01.628
Yeah, well, I'm
heading up there right now

03:01.662 --> 03:03.062
to check on those cows.

03:03.096 --> 03:05.432
It might be time
to start feeding 'em hay.

03:06.366 --> 03:07.734
Dad's back!

03:13.040 --> 03:16.142
<i>I thought you were
spending the week in Moose Jaw.</i>

03:16.176 --> 03:17.843
So did I.

03:18.812 --> 03:20.332
So you riding out
to check on the herd?

03:20.347 --> 03:22.281
You wanna lend a hand,

03:22.316 --> 03:24.150
actually pull your weight?

03:24.217 --> 03:25.418
That's funny. Yeah.

03:25.452 --> 03:26.985
Well, normally, I would,
but I'm kind of beat.

03:27.019 --> 03:28.320
It was an eight hour drive
from Moose Jaw,

03:28.354 --> 03:29.721
so maybe tomorrow morning.

03:29.756 --> 03:31.189
Nope.
They're predicting snow

03:31.223 --> 03:32.991
in the higher elevations
tonight.

03:33.025 --> 03:35.093
It's now or never.

03:38.898 --> 03:40.298
All right, fine!

03:41.968 --> 03:43.801
Dad-dad, no!

03:43.836 --> 03:45.470
<i>Look, I just rode him, okay?</i>

03:45.504 --> 03:47.205
Chasing cattle
might be too much.

03:47.239 --> 03:48.639
He'll be fine.

03:48.674 --> 03:50.741
Hi-yah!

03:55.181 --> 03:56.814
<i>Woo! Nice! Yeah!</i>

03:56.849 --> 03:58.529
<i>That's the
extension that you want.</i>

03:58.550 --> 03:59.951
<i>Okay, next up.</i>

04:06.658 --> 04:07.859
<i>Way to go!</i>

04:07.893 --> 04:10.327
Nice work!
Really coming along.

04:10.362 --> 04:11.863
<i>Oh, and before I forget,</i>
<i>I wanted to mention</i>

04:11.930 --> 04:14.732
<i>that a space has opened up</i>
<i>in the extreme team.</i>

04:14.766 --> 04:16.966
- What's that?
- A trick-riding team.

04:17.002 --> 04:18.168
They train here in the winter

04:18.236 --> 04:20.437
and then perform in local rodeos
all summer.

04:20.471 --> 04:22.172
Anybody interested
in auditioning

04:22.240 --> 04:24.208
should talk to me after class.

04:27.949 --> 04:29.389
Come on, Jack,
pick up the pace!

04:29.414 --> 04:31.015
You're asleep at the wheel!

04:31.049 --> 04:33.216
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:33.283 --> 04:35.084
Are you texting?!

04:37.488 --> 04:39.055
Since when do you text?

04:39.089 --> 04:40.657
<i>Since Lisa went to France.</i>

04:40.725 --> 04:42.258
It reminds me of a telegram;

04:42.292 --> 04:44.995
it's short and sweet,
and to the point.

04:45.029 --> 04:46.830
Ugh...

04:46.898 --> 04:48.632
Oh, what is your problem?

04:48.699 --> 04:50.966
You're acting like a teenager.

04:51.035 --> 04:53.169
Worse - a teenager
that can't multi-task.

04:55.039 --> 04:57.473
Okay, that's it,
I'm outta here!

04:57.541 --> 04:58.908
Hi-yah!

05:00.810 --> 05:02.978
Hey! Slow down!

05:03.047 --> 05:04.480
Damn fool's gonna kill
that horse!

05:04.515 --> 05:05.448
Hup!

05:20.664 --> 05:23.031
♪ And at the break of day

05:23.099 --> 05:27.835
♪ you sank into your dream

05:27.903 --> 05:29.137

05:29.205 --> 05:32.074

05:48.523 --> 05:50.024
Hey, Amy, how are you?

05:50.092 --> 05:52.159
Hey, Mr. Hartfield.
How are you?

05:52.194 --> 05:54.195
Good! Here.

05:54.262 --> 05:56.022
I wanted to pay you
for all that work you did

05:56.064 --> 05:57.398
with flying easy.

05:57.466 --> 05:59.366
Oh, thanks.
How's he doing?

05:59.434 --> 06:01.935
Well, he's not exactly
burning up the track,

06:01.970 --> 06:03.036
but he's loading

06:03.105 --> 06:04.385
and breaking clean
from the gate,

06:04.406 --> 06:06.507
so... that's good.

06:07.442 --> 06:10.811
Listen,
is your granddad around?

06:10.845 --> 06:13.246
Um, yeah, he just went up
to check on his cows.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.481
Oh, good. Good!

06:14.515 --> 06:16.483
Jeez, you know,
I was so glad to hear

06:16.517 --> 06:18.652
that he rallied from
his little health issue there,

06:18.686 --> 06:21.454
and well now he and Lisa
are back together,

06:21.489 --> 06:23.389
and boy, I know
how that feels, you know.

06:23.424 --> 06:27.427
Love makes you feel like
you can just live forever.

06:27.495 --> 06:29.429
Amy:

06:29.463 --> 06:30.763
<i>Dad, he's sweating like crazy!</i>

06:30.797 --> 06:32.365
What did you do?

06:32.399 --> 06:33.633
I just rode him
like I always do.

06:33.667 --> 06:34.934
Hello, Dan.

06:34.968 --> 06:36.636
Tim.

06:36.670 --> 06:38.671
Once upon a time
you had some decent horses,

06:38.705 --> 06:41.608
and now here you are again
with this...

06:41.642 --> 06:43.909
sorry excuse for a ranch horse!

06:43.944 --> 06:45.310
You're an expert now?

06:45.345 --> 06:47.546
Well, actually, we have
diversified the stable

06:47.580 --> 06:49.815
to include some quality
cutting horses

06:49.850 --> 06:51.617
and some working cow horses.

06:51.652 --> 06:52.785
Terrific.

06:52.819 --> 06:56.622
Yeah, in fact,
we've won the odd buckle.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.491
Which is why I think that,
you know,

06:59.526 --> 07:00.660
when it comes to that horse,

07:00.694 --> 07:03.928
he's about as past his prime
as... you are.

07:05.632 --> 07:07.366
We'll see ya.

07:09.935 --> 07:11.336
Idiot.

07:17.677 --> 07:19.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:25.918 --> 07:27.919
Hey, Jack.

07:27.987 --> 07:29.688
Dan Hartfield.

07:30.856 --> 07:32.991
What're you doing here, Dan?

07:33.025 --> 07:35.025
I was just paying
your granddaughter

07:35.093 --> 07:36.794
what I owe her.

07:36.861 --> 07:38.496
You know, even after
what happened with Lisa,

07:38.530 --> 07:41.699
I still somehow manage
to pay my bills.

07:41.766 --> 07:44.368
Lisa, huh?

07:44.403 --> 07:46.837
Yeah, it turns out
your little rapprochement

07:46.871 --> 07:49.039
with my ex-wife had a...

07:49.107 --> 07:51.108
a negative effect
on my bottom line.

07:51.176 --> 07:53.243
What are you talking about?

07:53.277 --> 07:57.314
Lisa, she was all set
to sell Fairfield,

07:57.381 --> 07:59.416
invest in this little venture
of mine out in France, when-

07:59.450 --> 08:01.130
well, I guess you'll have
to get your money

08:01.152 --> 08:04.154
somewhere else now, won't you?

08:04.222 --> 08:06.924
Oh, she'll come around, Jack.

08:06.991 --> 08:08.958
You know,
let me give you some advice.

08:08.992 --> 08:11.294
I've known Lisa
for a long time,

08:11.362 --> 08:13.162
and if you think
she's gonna turn into

08:13.231 --> 08:17.467
some little homebody
just for you,

08:17.535 --> 08:19.569
you've got another
think coming.

08:19.637 --> 08:20.837
Yeah.

08:20.904 --> 08:22.839
Whatever you say, Dan.

08:33.683 --> 08:35.885
Did you make this schedule?

08:36.820 --> 08:39.255
Yup. Scott asked me to.

08:39.322 --> 08:41.490
I'm only working nights
and weekends.

08:41.558 --> 08:43.525
All nights and weekends.

08:43.592 --> 08:44.960
Well, I've been working
with Scott

08:44.994 --> 08:46.128
a lot longer than you have,

08:46.162 --> 08:47.630
so it makes sense
that I have more hours.

08:47.697 --> 08:49.298
And better hours!

08:49.332 --> 08:51.433
You know, I'm going to school
just like you,

08:51.468 --> 08:53.902
<i>but I'm expected to basically</i>
<i>have no social life</i>

08:53.936 --> 08:56.238
and function on no sleep?

08:56.306 --> 08:57.605
Look...

08:57.640 --> 09:00.008
maybe if you drop the attitude,
we can discuss it.

09:00.076 --> 09:01.309
What attitude?!

09:01.343 --> 09:03.645
Well, Scott says there have been
some complaints

09:03.712 --> 09:07.015
from clients who say you're...
difficult.

09:07.049 --> 09:08.583
Huh! Wow!

09:08.651 --> 09:10.952
And I thought you were the one
with the bad attitude.

09:10.987 --> 09:12.320
What's that supposed to mean?

09:12.354 --> 09:13.988
I don't know, you tell me.

09:14.055 --> 09:16.291
I'm just a vet assistant,
not a therapist!

09:17.259 --> 09:18.926
Okay...

09:18.994 --> 09:19.960
Is there anything
I should know?

09:19.995 --> 09:21.529
Any new additions?

09:21.563 --> 09:23.765
Yeah, this is Duncan.

09:23.799 --> 09:25.600
His owner wants to put him
up for adoption,

09:25.634 --> 09:26.967
or worse.

09:27.002 --> 09:29.404
It turns out her new boyfriend
is allergic to cats.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.905
Well, it happens.

09:30.939 --> 09:32.840
Yeah, and it also
happens that said boyfriend

09:32.874 --> 09:35.009
will most likely dump her
in a month or two,

09:35.043 --> 09:36.677
<i>then she won't have</i>
<i>a boyfriend...</i>

09:36.744 --> 09:38.145
or a cat.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.817
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.920
Okay, let's get started.

09:45.954 --> 09:48.322
So when I've got my feet
in the straps,

09:48.356 --> 09:50.757
I take a deep cleansing breath,

09:50.792 --> 09:53.560
and free fall back
out of the saddle.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.128
<i>Something like this:</i>

10:09.944 --> 10:11.911
And there you have it.

10:11.946 --> 10:14.881
They don't call it
the suicide drag for nothing!

10:14.915 --> 10:17.717
Would that be a
good trick for my audition?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.185
Georgie, the audition
is for the older,

10:19.220 --> 10:20.886
more experienced kids.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.823
You're good,
but you really need to wait.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.290
Wait for what?

10:25.325 --> 10:29.161
Until you've been trick riding
longer than a couple months.

10:34.368 --> 10:37.102
So then Cass tells
this poor client

10:37.136 --> 10:39.804
that she should keep the cat
and re-home the boyfriend.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.907
Well, that sounds about right.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.809
No, you can't talk
to clients like that.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.745
Then Cass had the nerve
to tell her

10:46.812 --> 10:48.513
to give her boyfriend
some antihistamines

10:48.581 --> 10:49.748
until she figured out
if the relationship

10:49.815 --> 10:50.883
was gonna pan out.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.851
Well, at least
she's being honest.

10:52.885 --> 10:54.045
I had to call the client back

10:54.052 --> 10:55.413
and straighten
the whole thing out!

10:55.421 --> 10:57.955
Oh, that reminds me.
Amy, your dad called.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.491
Says he's coming over
in the morning,

10:59.558 --> 11:01.025
wants us both to be here.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.327
- Why? What's up?
- He won't say.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.897
But one thing I do know,
something's bugging him

11:05.964 --> 11:07.599
and whatever he says
to the contrary

11:07.633 --> 11:09.166
is just a load of B.S.!

11:09.234 --> 11:11.168
Yeah, tell me about it.
I saw him this morning

11:11.203 --> 11:13.504
and his B.S. factor
was way off the chart.

11:16.275 --> 11:18.542
I brought you some pie...

11:18.610 --> 11:20.311
seeing as you missed dinner.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.413
Thanks, but I'll pass.

11:23.448 --> 11:26.617
Okay, Georgie, what's wrong?

11:26.684 --> 11:29.319
Well, have you ever wanted
to do something,

11:29.387 --> 11:32.589
but then people keep saying
you have to wait?

11:32.657 --> 11:33.924
Well, people have tried.

11:33.991 --> 11:35.426
But if it's something
that I really want,

11:35.493 --> 11:37.861
then I usually do it anyway.

11:37.896 --> 11:39.797
What is this something?

11:39.831 --> 11:42.498
The extreme team trick riders.

11:42.533 --> 11:43.666
Really?

11:43.700 --> 11:45.435
I've seen them at rodeos,
they're amazing!

11:45.469 --> 11:46.836
Well, I really want
to audition,

11:46.904 --> 11:49.940
but I need a cool trick
like the suicide drag

11:50.007 --> 11:53.509
and Sandra says
that's too advanced.

11:53.544 --> 11:56.546
Well, Sandra knows
what she's talking about.

11:56.580 --> 11:57.647
Come on, Georgie,
they don't call it

11:57.714 --> 12:00.750
the suicide drag for nothing!

12:11.829 --> 12:13.796
Dad, hey.

12:13.864 --> 12:17.766
No, today's not a great day.
Tomorrow would be better.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.868
What do you mean?

12:22.038 --> 12:23.339
Oh no!

12:24.074 --> 12:27.809
Allow me to introduce you to...
Smoke 'n' Mirrors,

12:27.844 --> 12:28.910
last year's second place winner

12:28.945 --> 12:31.813
of the working cow horse
jubilee.

12:31.848 --> 12:34.148
Wait, dad. Did
you buy this horse?

12:34.183 --> 12:35.484
Bill of sale's in the truck.

12:35.518 --> 12:37.185
Can I ask why?

12:37.219 --> 12:38.887
Well, Jack,

12:38.955 --> 12:40.689
to keep up the tradition
of working cattle

12:40.723 --> 12:43.391
that dates back
to the Spanish vaqueros.

12:43.425 --> 12:45.494
Ole!

12:49.131 --> 12:51.466
You know, he's a really
nice looking horse.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
I'm tellin' you,

12:52.537 --> 12:53.777
if this horse were
a sports car,

12:53.802 --> 12:55.970
he'd be Formula One.

12:56.005 --> 12:57.505
You know, if you went out
and got a sports car,

12:57.539 --> 12:58.973
I'd get the point.

12:59.008 --> 13:00.341
But your palomino!

13:00.351 --> 13:02.152
Dad, other than maybe lacking
a little muscle,

13:02.177 --> 13:03.544
what's wrong with him?

13:03.578 --> 13:04.812
Nothing.

13:04.846 --> 13:06.146
But it's like a relationship.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.983
You know, after a while
it can go stale.

13:09.017 --> 13:10.651
You know maybe if you'd
given him a name,

13:10.685 --> 13:13.120
you'd feel more
of a connection to him!

13:13.187 --> 13:15.088
<i>I mean, he's still</i>
<i>a perfectly good horse</i>

13:15.156 --> 13:16.724
for what you need him to do!

13:16.758 --> 13:18.425
Yeah, but maybe my needs
have changed.

13:18.459 --> 13:21.328
It's like Dan Hartfield said,
and I hate to admit it,

13:21.362 --> 13:22.929
that palomino's past his prime

13:22.963 --> 13:25.565
and he's dragging me down
with him!

13:25.599 --> 13:26.900
You ready?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.811
You betcha. Let's see
what this baby's got!

13:32.407 --> 13:34.508
Here we go!

13:35.943 --> 13:36.976
Hup!

13:40.948 --> 13:43.016
Oh! Oh! Okay!

13:44.084 --> 13:45.484
He's good!

13:45.519 --> 13:47.286
Come on, dad!

13:47.354 --> 13:48.421
Woo!

13:53.126 --> 13:56.628
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh!

13:56.663 --> 13:57.696
Nice one!

13:59.999 --> 14:01.200
<i>Way to stick it!</i>

14:01.268 --> 14:02.801
Yeah, barely!

14:05.205 --> 14:06.572
Ole.

14:34.700 --> 14:35.766
Okay.

14:43.476 --> 14:45.476
Hey, I did it!

14:45.510 --> 14:46.577
Wow!

14:48.279 --> 14:49.947
Whoa! Slow down!

14:49.982 --> 14:51.115
Easy, boy!

14:51.182 --> 14:53.383
- Georgie, stop!
- I can't!

14:53.418 --> 14:55.185
I can't!
I can't get up!

15:07.132 --> 15:09.566
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?!

15:17.082 --> 15:18.149
Thanks.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.958
Um, excuse me, sir,
is this seat taken?

15:26.992 --> 15:29.327
Uh, actually, yeah.
It's reserved for my fiancee,

15:29.361 --> 15:31.029
in case she shows up
unexpectedly.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.163
Good answer!

15:32.198 --> 15:33.597
So what are you up to?

15:33.632 --> 15:34.699
Well, I'm picking
up some supplements

15:34.733 --> 15:35.967
for my dad's new horse.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.536
Something that'll take
the edge off a little.

15:38.570 --> 15:39.971
Your dad or the horse?

15:40.005 --> 15:41.071
Funny.

15:43.608 --> 15:44.842
Listen, Amy,

15:44.876 --> 15:46.009
don't take this personally,
all right?

15:46.044 --> 15:47.911
- I'm gonna take off.
- Got it.

15:47.946 --> 15:50.881
- See you later.
- See ya.

15:50.915 --> 15:52.216
Tim.

15:57.922 --> 15:59.422
What's with Ty?

15:59.457 --> 16:00.824
Busy schedule.

16:07.465 --> 16:09.366
<i>Thanks!</i>

16:15.172 --> 16:17.073
What are you
doing home so early?

16:17.140 --> 16:19.942
Didn't you have something
going on after school?

16:20.010 --> 16:21.811
Well, I did, but...

16:21.846 --> 16:24.313
it turns out trick riding
is just kinda lame.

16:24.348 --> 16:25.682
Really?

16:25.750 --> 16:29.151
Yeah, it gets in the way
of my show jumping.

16:29.186 --> 16:31.653
Well, I'm surprised
to hear that.

16:31.688 --> 16:33.689
I think I'll just stick
to riding Phoenix

16:33.757 --> 16:35.657
from now on.

16:35.692 --> 16:37.826
Sounds reasonable.

16:37.861 --> 16:40.897
Except I don't believe
a word of it.

16:42.632 --> 16:45.101
Okay... I did something
really stupid,

16:45.168 --> 16:48.169
but it's not like
I was galloping or anything!

16:48.237 --> 16:50.238
<i>I was practically walking.</i>

16:50.306 --> 16:51.673
Barely even trotting!

16:52.642 --> 16:54.075
But my teacher,

16:54.110 --> 16:58.280
she says that kids
who can't play by the rules

16:58.347 --> 17:00.549
have no business
being in her class.

17:00.617 --> 17:02.518
Well, that makes sense to me.

17:02.585 --> 17:05.653
I must be the
only person in the world

17:05.686 --> 17:09.824
to ever be expelled
from trick riding school.

17:09.892 --> 17:12.993
Well, let's say
that's possibly true.

17:13.029 --> 17:16.064
Now, what are you gonna do
about it?

17:21.537 --> 17:23.002
Seriously, dad?!
The jubilee?

17:23.070 --> 17:24.872
Are you out of your mind?

17:24.940 --> 17:26.373
No!

17:26.407 --> 17:28.609
I've suffered
a few setbacks recently.

17:28.644 --> 17:29.977
But I'm a competitive guy,

17:30.045 --> 17:32.079
I need to get back to basics.

17:32.147 --> 17:33.848
For me, the basics are a cow,

17:33.916 --> 17:35.416
a horse, and a stopwatch.

17:35.484 --> 17:36.917
Okay, I get it, all right?

17:36.985 --> 17:39.053
You were a star
in your rodeo days,

17:39.087 --> 17:40.247
but that was a long time ago.

17:40.288 --> 17:43.057
Hey! A lot of guys
my age still compete

17:43.091 --> 17:44.391
in timed events.

17:44.459 --> 17:45.692
Yeah, okay,

17:45.726 --> 17:47.126
but the jubilee
is around the corner

17:47.128 --> 17:48.162
and do you have time to train?

17:48.196 --> 17:49.763
I'll make time!
I'll make time.

17:49.831 --> 17:51.598
And with a horse like Smoke,

17:51.632 --> 17:53.333
you could turn me
into the comeback kid,

17:53.367 --> 17:54.501
especially if you help me.

17:54.535 --> 17:55.569
No, dad.

17:55.603 --> 17:57.036
Look, I don't know
about this, okay?

17:57.071 --> 17:58.839
Amy!

17:58.906 --> 18:01.374
I am not some random client.

18:01.408 --> 18:02.976
No, and if you were,

18:03.043 --> 18:04.963
I would tell you that Smoke
is a way better horse

18:05.012 --> 18:07.180
than you are a cowboy.

18:07.247 --> 18:08.314
Please, go on.

18:08.349 --> 18:09.782
I'm just saying
that you might be better

18:09.816 --> 18:11.817
running your palomino on cattle

18:11.852 --> 18:14.120
and blowing your money
on a new truck,

18:14.188 --> 18:15.254
or a sports car.

18:15.289 --> 18:16.850
Well, it's a good thing
I'm your father.

18:16.857 --> 18:18.157
That way you can save
all your honesty

18:18.192 --> 18:20.126
for other people.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.295
Dad...
Honey, please.

18:23.297 --> 18:25.365
Will you work
your magic for me?

18:28.935 --> 18:31.136
Any new admissions?

18:31.170 --> 18:33.438
Yeah, this old girl,
her name's Charlotte.

18:33.473 --> 18:34.640
She used to be
a seeing-eye dog,

18:34.708 --> 18:36.375
but now she developed
really bad arthritis

18:36.409 --> 18:38.210
and she can barely get around.

18:38.277 --> 18:40.412
And she's got
a chronic kidney disease.

18:40.446 --> 18:41.680
So any meds
that'll help her walk

18:41.715 --> 18:43.415
are just gonna affect
her kidneys.

18:43.449 --> 18:44.582
Her owner really depends on her,

18:44.617 --> 18:47.552
so she's got a difficult
decision to make.

18:47.586 --> 18:49.021
I get that
the owner is disabled,

18:49.055 --> 18:52.557
but it's cruel
to let a dog live in pain.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.859
I'm sure whoever owns this dog
is sensitive to her pain.

18:56.396 --> 18:57.729
Look, all I'm saying is,

18:57.763 --> 19:00.532
has anyone tried
any alternative therapies?

19:00.566 --> 19:02.199
Not that I know of.

19:02.234 --> 19:04.536
Well, it's a no-brainer.

19:04.570 --> 19:07.371
Maybe, but it's not your job
to suggest treatment options.

19:07.406 --> 19:09.874
You're here to monitor the dog
overnight and in the morning.

19:09.909 --> 19:12.577
<i>Scott will call the owner</i>
<i>and discuss the situation.</i>

19:12.645 --> 19:14.178
Wow, I knew you were a jerk,

19:14.212 --> 19:16.180
but I thought you at least cared
about animals!

19:16.214 --> 19:17.581
You're one to talk!

19:17.615 --> 19:19.883
You let your boyfriend
kill his horse on your watch!

19:22.820 --> 19:23.887
Okay.

19:24.889 --> 19:26.424
I get it.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.991
Your problem with me
has nothing to do

19:28.026 --> 19:29.793
with my attitude at work.

19:29.827 --> 19:31.595
You're still pissed off
about Jeremy.

19:31.663 --> 19:33.396
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

19:38.970 --> 19:40.236
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

19:40.304 --> 19:41.872
I was just thinking about you.

19:41.906 --> 19:43.874
About how dumb I was?

19:43.942 --> 19:46.977
I know, and I'm really sorry.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.678
Okay.

19:48.712 --> 19:51.013
What I did
was incredibly dangerous.

19:51.082 --> 19:54.084
Not just for the horse,
but for me as well.

19:54.118 --> 19:56.986
But when I want something,
I kind of just go for it.

19:57.054 --> 19:59.522
And I get that.

19:59.557 --> 20:01.657
You do?

20:01.725 --> 20:03.126
Yes.

20:03.194 --> 20:04.760
I've been thinking a lot
about what you did,

20:04.795 --> 20:08.030
and even though
it was really dumb,

20:08.098 --> 20:10.066
it was also really brave,

20:10.133 --> 20:13.669
and you need to be crazy brave
to be a great trick rider.

20:13.737 --> 20:17.073
Crazy enough to teach yourself
the suicide drag.

20:17.140 --> 20:20.409
I just really wanted
to audition.

20:20.477 --> 20:21.977
And I'm gonna help you.

20:22.044 --> 20:23.712
You are?

20:23.779 --> 20:25.340
But trick riders who do
the suicide drag

20:25.348 --> 20:26.648
are a dime a dozen.

20:26.716 --> 20:28.217
If you wanna make
a big impression,

20:28.284 --> 20:30.586
you need a signature move.

20:30.653 --> 20:32.354
I don't have one.

20:32.422 --> 20:33.822
I'll lend you mine.

20:33.889 --> 20:35.790
The tandem hippodrome.

20:35.858 --> 20:37.526
It's a trick I used to do
with my sister.

20:37.594 --> 20:39.928
It might be time to pass it on
to the next generation.

20:39.996 --> 20:41.262
Okay!

20:41.330 --> 20:43.832
So the hippodrome
is pretty basic.

20:43.866 --> 20:45.466
Do you remember how to do it?

20:45.534 --> 20:46.467
Yep.

20:46.535 --> 20:48.670
My feet in the straps,

20:48.738 --> 20:50.739
and then...

20:50.773 --> 20:52.107
stand up.

20:52.174 --> 20:54.475
But what about those toes?

20:54.543 --> 20:56.710
You have to point them
straight down,

20:56.778 --> 20:59.480
and you stand straight,
with your arms outstretched.

20:59.548 --> 21:00.848
Like this?

21:00.915 --> 21:02.783
Now, arch your back,

21:02.817 --> 21:07.155
and it'll be just about perfect
when you remember to smile.

21:09.291 --> 21:12.826
Now, you wanna
take it up a notch?

21:21.402 --> 21:24.071
Come on,
don't fall apart on me!

21:24.139 --> 21:25.205
Okay...

21:25.239 --> 21:27.107
Not okay!

21:27.142 --> 21:28.308
<i>Your knees are bent,</i>

21:28.342 --> 21:30.544
your butt is sticking out
a mile.

21:30.578 --> 21:32.812
Not pretty!
Do you wanna stop?

21:33.747 --> 21:37.384
No. No, I can do this!

21:37.418 --> 21:39.952
Imagine you've got a string
coming out the top of your head

21:39.987 --> 21:42.055
and it's pulling you up.

21:43.357 --> 21:45.825
<i>That's it!</i>
<i>That's good!</i>

21:47.761 --> 21:51.330
Okay, now let's try it
with your arms out.

21:54.467 --> 21:55.601
Now you're flying!

22:00.207 --> 22:03.175
Now, how do you feel
about hot pink?

22:05.978 --> 22:07.546
Yeesh.

22:09.916 --> 22:11.483
Ta-da!

22:14.754 --> 22:15.787
Ta-da!

22:17.323 --> 22:19.357
Ta-da!
Yeeeaaaaaaah...

22:23.429 --> 22:25.839
You look like the real deal.
Way to go!

22:25.959 --> 22:27.452
Way to knock!

22:36.595 --> 22:39.384
<i>I don't know what the
deal is with your dad.</i>

22:39.504 --> 22:41.004
He came back early
from Moose Jaw

22:41.038 --> 22:42.672
and he seems all out of sorts.

22:42.707 --> 22:44.408
Jack, you seen Amy?

22:44.442 --> 22:45.442
Hold on, Lou.

22:45.476 --> 22:46.943
She's driving Georgie
to school.

22:46.977 --> 22:49.646
Here, talk to your daughter.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.715
Lou, I'll just-

22:51.783 --> 22:53.283
I'll have your dad
call you, okay?

22:53.317 --> 22:54.418
Kiss Katie for me.

22:54.485 --> 22:55.819
Okay.

22:56.284 --> 22:58.364
Why won't you talk to her?
She hasn't heard from you-

22:58.389 --> 23:00.689
I got a lot on my mind, okay?

23:00.724 --> 23:01.824
How's she doing?

23:01.858 --> 23:03.126
Well, I'm betting
she's counting the days

23:03.160 --> 23:04.527
until she can come home.

23:04.594 --> 23:07.496
Yeah? Well, you're always
a glass-half-empty kinda guy,

23:07.564 --> 23:08.965
aren't 'ya?

23:09.033 --> 23:11.935
I'll bet you she's loving it.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.513
Are you gonna tell me
what happened in Moose Jaw

23:14.538 --> 23:15.938
or not?!

23:30.086 --> 23:31.286
What's going on?

23:31.354 --> 23:33.655
What does it look like?

23:33.722 --> 23:35.890
Okay, but did you talk
to Scott first?

23:35.925 --> 23:37.292
Obviously!

23:37.757 --> 23:39.437
I thought the old girl
could really benefit

23:39.462 --> 23:40.929
from acupuncture.

23:40.997 --> 23:42.230
Scott agreed.

23:42.265 --> 23:45.200
It turns out
her owner uses it herself.

23:45.234 --> 23:46.801
Where'd you learn to do this?

23:46.836 --> 23:48.069
Took an elective.

23:48.136 --> 23:50.004
Veterinary acupuncture.

23:50.973 --> 23:53.741
I can't promise any miracles,
but maybe Charlotte's owner

23:53.809 --> 23:57.445
won't have to make
that difficult decision.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.125
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said,

24:02.150 --> 24:04.018
and uh...

24:04.086 --> 24:05.419
maybe I have been holding
a bit of a grudge

24:05.454 --> 24:08.389
about the whole Jeremy thing.

24:08.457 --> 24:10.657
Really?
Just "maybe?"

24:13.628 --> 24:14.928
To be honest, Cassandra,

24:14.963 --> 24:16.663
I just don't understand
why you'd cover for a guy

24:16.698 --> 24:18.099
who killed his own horse.

24:18.133 --> 24:20.968
Well, probably because
I'm the world's worst

24:21.035 --> 24:22.669
judge of character.

24:23.905 --> 24:27.674
But haven't you ever met a guy
who just rolls right over you?

24:27.709 --> 24:30.110
A guy you just can't
stand up to?

24:32.113 --> 24:33.714
Yeah, I can think of one.

24:33.748 --> 24:36.282
<i>Okay, dad, stay
soft and don't choke up.</i>

24:36.317 --> 24:38.418
Well, you're not the one
sitting on a powder keg.

24:38.452 --> 24:40.786
He knows his job,
just let him do it.

24:40.821 --> 24:42.455
Yeah, yeah, okay!
Let's go!

24:42.490 --> 24:44.130
Dad, if you're not
gonna listen to me,

24:44.158 --> 24:45.158
I don't know why I'm here!

24:45.159 --> 24:46.692
I get it, okay?

24:46.727 --> 24:48.461
Be soft, don't choke, whatever.
Let's go.

24:48.496 --> 24:50.897
- I'm ready.
- Okay, fine!

24:51.999 --> 24:54.734
Here we go.

24:54.768 --> 24:56.502
Hi-yah!

24:56.570 --> 24:58.303
Come on!

25:02.042 --> 25:03.709
That's it, that's it!

25:03.744 --> 25:05.645
Drop your hands,
let him do his job!

25:05.679 --> 25:07.079
I got it!

25:11.317 --> 25:13.452
Hup! Come on!

25:13.486 --> 25:14.819
Hah! Hah!

25:16.756 --> 25:18.657
Agh! Ungh! Oh!

25:18.691 --> 25:20.992
Dad! Dad!

25:25.598 --> 25:27.632
Dad, you okay?

25:27.700 --> 25:30.201
Oh, yeah. Woo!

25:30.235 --> 25:32.571
A little timing thing there.

25:32.638 --> 25:33.972
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:34.006 --> 25:35.106
I just tweaked the shoulder
a bit,

25:35.140 --> 25:36.841
that's all.

25:36.876 --> 25:41.012
I hope it wasn't your
bad shoulder.

25:41.047 --> 25:43.381
Oh...

25:43.415 --> 25:44.815
Come here.

25:48.587 --> 25:49.920
<i>You want some more tea?</i>

25:49.988 --> 25:51.622
Yeah. Thanks.

25:52.624 --> 25:54.592
What's on your mind?

25:54.626 --> 25:56.127
My dad.

25:56.161 --> 25:57.295
It's bad enough
that he bought a horse

25:57.329 --> 25:59.063
he can't even stay on.

25:59.097 --> 26:00.864
But he fell off
on his bad shoulder,

26:00.932 --> 26:04.101
and now he can barely
move his arm.

26:04.168 --> 26:07.571
Well, he might've just
aggravated an old injury.

26:07.639 --> 26:08.939
Or it might be something
more serious:

26:08.974 --> 26:10.240
Separated shoulder,

26:10.274 --> 26:12.109
fractured clavicle.

26:12.143 --> 26:13.410
Did he get an X-ray?

26:13.478 --> 26:16.613
Are you kidding me?!
He still thinks he can compete.

26:16.647 --> 26:19.282
There's obviously something
going on with him.

26:19.350 --> 26:21.651
Well, whatever it is,

26:21.719 --> 26:23.553
I bet it has nothing
to do with horses.

26:25.856 --> 26:28.525
Yeah, I tried to talk to him,

26:28.593 --> 26:31.160
but he just rolled
right over me.

26:31.228 --> 26:32.561
That's funny.

26:32.630 --> 26:34.330
What?

26:34.397 --> 26:36.866
Well, that's what Cass said
about Jeremy.

26:36.934 --> 26:39.535
Wow! You guys talk
about Jeremy?

26:39.603 --> 26:40.903
Well, we had to deal
with what happened.

26:40.971 --> 26:42.171
We work together, right?

26:42.205 --> 26:44.674
So he was kinda like
the elephant in the room.

26:44.742 --> 26:46.475
Some elephant.

26:46.543 --> 26:47.610
Well, she's not proud
of what she did,

26:47.677 --> 26:49.545
but Jeremy's one
of those guys where...

26:49.579 --> 26:51.247
like she said,
he's hard to say no to.

26:51.314 --> 26:52.548
Yeah, well,
it's next to impossible

26:52.616 --> 26:54.316
when that guy's your dad!

26:54.384 --> 26:56.285
No pressure, Amy, but...

26:56.353 --> 26:58.320
I have seen you do
the impossible.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.022
Yeah, no pressure.

27:14.037 --> 27:16.237
I say we're
ready, what do you think?

27:16.272 --> 27:18.140
Bring it!

27:18.207 --> 27:20.275
Here, you need this.

27:20.309 --> 27:21.842
What is it?

27:21.910 --> 27:24.845
My sister used to hold it
when we rode together.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.982
Well, are you sure it's okay
I carry it?

27:28.050 --> 27:29.116
Are you kidding?

27:29.151 --> 27:31.186
Without it, it's just a trick.

27:31.253 --> 27:33.221
With it, it's a performance!

27:36.758 --> 27:39.160
♪ Been so tired
I cannot sleep ♪

27:40.595 --> 27:41.796

Well, I wanna ride Phoenix!

28:13.556 --> 28:14.756
Well, breakfast first!

28:14.791 --> 28:17.592
When Lou gets back,
she will not be happy

28:17.626 --> 28:19.127
if she finds out
you've been skipping

28:19.195 --> 28:20.962
the most important meal
of the day.

28:20.997 --> 28:22.664
Well then, don't tell her!

28:26.202 --> 28:27.935
Hello?

28:27.969 --> 28:30.605
Yes, she is.
Just hold on.

28:30.639 --> 28:32.674
It's for you, it's Sandra.

28:35.211 --> 28:36.277
Hello?

28:37.580 --> 28:38.680
Hi!

28:40.382 --> 28:42.917
<i>Yeah?</i>

28:42.951 --> 28:44.952
Oh.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.353
Okay.

28:46.387 --> 28:47.855
You too. Bye.

28:48.924 --> 28:50.357
So?

28:50.425 --> 28:53.060
- So what?
- What did she want?

28:53.128 --> 28:54.195
Nothing.

28:56.531 --> 28:57.931
I thought you were
going riding.

28:57.965 --> 28:59.933
I changed my mind.

29:04.505 --> 29:06.139
Hey, Ty, check this out.

29:06.173 --> 29:07.774
Dinnertime! Go!

29:08.743 --> 29:10.377
Wow!

29:10.445 --> 29:11.445
That's a big improvement.

29:11.512 --> 29:12.646
I know!

29:12.680 --> 29:15.014
I spoke to her owner
and she's thrilled.

29:15.082 --> 29:16.716
But there's a problem.

29:16.784 --> 29:18.351
Charlotte's gonna need
a few more sessions,

29:18.385 --> 29:20.353
which means changing
your precious schedule

29:20.420 --> 29:22.055
so I'm around to do
a couple more treatments

29:22.123 --> 29:24.791
during regular working hours.

29:24.859 --> 29:26.392
All right, well...

29:26.460 --> 29:27.627
why don't you pencil in
the days you want,

29:27.694 --> 29:29.929
and I'll make the schedule work
for both of us.

29:29.964 --> 29:31.430
Really?

29:31.498 --> 29:32.665
I would hug you,

29:32.733 --> 29:34.967
but I gotta protect
my reputation.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.336
You know,
the one of being difficult?

29:39.439 --> 29:40.806
Good girl!

29:42.075 --> 29:43.108
Hey!

29:44.411 --> 29:47.212
Where's the boy?
Where's Smoke?

29:47.280 --> 29:48.981
Come on!
We got a session.

29:49.949 --> 29:51.016
No, we don't.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.584
Yeah, come on!
We're in training here!

29:52.652 --> 29:55.087
No, dad, we're not training
when you're injured.

29:55.155 --> 29:56.188
Oh!

29:56.222 --> 29:58.257
Hey, I'm an old rodeo cowboy.

29:58.324 --> 30:00.692
You think a fall off a horse
is gonna hold me back?

30:00.760 --> 30:02.294
Well, at least go see
a doctor, okay?

30:02.328 --> 30:03.728
Ty thinks you need
an X-ray.

30:03.796 --> 30:05.263
Ty thinks?!

30:05.298 --> 30:06.498
I'll tell you what,

30:06.532 --> 30:07.599
when I get an extra pair of legs
and a tail,

30:07.667 --> 30:09.267
I'll ask Ty for medical advice.

30:09.302 --> 30:12.136
Okay, even if your shoulder
was a hundred percent,

30:12.171 --> 30:14.138
Smoke is way too much
horse for you!

30:14.173 --> 30:16.675
Well, that's not for you
to decide!

30:16.709 --> 30:18.543
You asked for my help, dad!

30:18.577 --> 30:20.411
You really want my advice?

30:20.478 --> 30:23.480
Smoke is not the solution
to whatever's bothering you!

30:23.515 --> 30:24.615
I never said he was.

30:24.683 --> 30:26.250
No, well, I guess being tough

30:26.285 --> 30:27.718
has nothing to do
with being smart

30:27.752 --> 30:31.555
'cause you're acting
like an idiot!

30:31.589 --> 30:33.490
I never thought that
I'd hear my daughter

30:33.558 --> 30:35.226
talk to me that way.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.427
I wouldn't have to

30:36.461 --> 30:37.428
if you told me
what was really going on!

30:37.462 --> 30:38.622
Well, that's not gonna happen.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.364
I don't whine about
my problems, okay?

30:40.432 --> 30:41.865
So just forget it.
You know what?!

30:41.899 --> 30:43.434
I'll practice on my own.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.135
No, you're not gonna
practice on your own, dad!

30:45.169 --> 30:46.236
Agghhhh!

30:47.905 --> 30:49.306
Okay.

30:49.341 --> 30:50.607
Let me take you
to the hospital.

30:50.642 --> 30:55.511
We do not need to talk,
just let me take you there.

30:55.546 --> 30:57.013
I'm fine.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.462
Okay, easy, boy, easy.

31:18.435 --> 31:20.169
Agh! Ow!

31:22.373 --> 31:24.106
Oh!

31:30.981 --> 31:32.214
Ohhh!

31:49.031 --> 31:51.099
What was I thinking?

32:04.546 --> 32:05.980
Hey.

32:09.118 --> 32:10.818
Hey.

32:14.456 --> 32:17.725
Sorry I missed
your audition yesterday.

32:17.759 --> 32:19.960
No big deal.

32:20.028 --> 32:22.530
Well, I really wanted to go.

32:22.597 --> 32:25.098
How did it go?

32:25.166 --> 32:27.868
Um, I didn't get it.

32:28.904 --> 32:31.238
You didn't?
What happened?

32:31.272 --> 32:33.573
Well, I kinda knew
from the beginning

32:33.641 --> 32:37.710
that I was probably too young
for them, so...

32:38.386 --> 32:40.347
Too young...

32:43.021 --> 32:46.260
Let me tell you something
about life, honey.

32:46.508 --> 32:49.088
The first thing is that...

32:49.156 --> 32:50.596
you should never let anybody
tell you

32:50.624 --> 32:53.159
what you can and can't do.

32:54.595 --> 32:57.530
<i>And the second thing is,</i>
<i>you're never too young...</i>

32:57.565 --> 32:58.731
for anything.

33:02.603 --> 33:05.504
Have you ever had a feeling...

33:05.572 --> 33:08.640
that comes from deep inside
that helps you decide

33:08.708 --> 33:11.344
whether something
is right for you

33:11.378 --> 33:13.946
or something is wrong for you?

33:15.282 --> 33:16.349
Yeah.

33:17.517 --> 33:21.720
That's called instinct.

33:21.788 --> 33:24.823
You have to learn
to trust that.

33:24.858 --> 33:27.258
Always trust your instincts.

33:31.631 --> 33:33.665
What do you think of him?

33:33.700 --> 33:35.100
He's beautiful.

33:36.235 --> 33:39.004
<i>His name's Smoke 'n' Mirrors.</i>

33:42.041 --> 33:43.508
I was training him to compete

33:43.542 --> 33:45.776
in the working cow horse
jubilee.

33:45.811 --> 33:47.678
R-really?

33:47.713 --> 33:49.414
Yep.

33:49.448 --> 33:50.715
Okay.

33:50.749 --> 33:53.451
He's great, but...

33:53.486 --> 33:56.721
I kinda like your old horse.

33:57.890 --> 33:59.023
Yeah, me too.

34:03.267 --> 34:06.831
But sometimes things change...

34:06.865 --> 34:11.034
and nothing lasts forever.

34:15.072 --> 34:16.473
You okay?

34:19.043 --> 34:20.444
Yup.

34:25.116 --> 34:26.983
Look who's back.

34:27.018 --> 34:28.351
Duncan!

34:28.385 --> 34:29.985
So I guess the relationship
with the allergic boyfriend

34:30.021 --> 34:31.286
is heating up.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.722
Or cooling off.

34:32.757 --> 34:33.822
The good news is,

34:33.860 --> 34:35.100
Duncan is only boarding with us

34:35.125 --> 34:36.760
while his owner is away.

34:36.793 --> 34:37.475
His owner is away

34:40.063 --> 34:41.764
and did you have anything
to do with that?

34:41.799 --> 34:42.866
No way!

34:42.900 --> 34:44.300
But I did suggest
a weekend in Vegas

34:44.301 --> 34:45.868
to get over the creep.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.141
You know,
I've been a bit of a jerk.

34:52.176 --> 34:53.342
A bit?!

34:53.377 --> 34:54.743
And any awkwardness
between us is-

34:54.811 --> 34:55.878
your fault.

34:56.813 --> 34:59.014
Yeah.

34:59.049 --> 35:01.416
I kinda get what was going on
with you and Jeremy,

35:01.484 --> 35:02.517
and I don't want you
to think that-

35:02.552 --> 35:04.553
look, stop.

35:04.588 --> 35:07.422
I don't need true confessions,
I just...

35:07.457 --> 35:09.491
I want a better schedule.

35:11.394 --> 35:13.495
What do you think of this one?

35:14.464 --> 35:17.365
Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
That's great...

35:17.433 --> 35:20.768
Mm... but this one.
Saturday mornings?

35:20.803 --> 35:22.523
I mean, how am I supposed
to party on Friday

35:22.538 --> 35:24.573
if I can't sleep in
on Saturday?

35:26.375 --> 35:27.442
You're right.

35:27.477 --> 35:28.310
I guess I didn't take
into consideration

35:28.377 --> 35:29.544
your party habits.

35:29.612 --> 35:31.879
Yeah, you wouldn't.
You're only engaged,

35:31.947 --> 35:35.516
but you act like
you've been married forever.

35:43.726 --> 35:47.028
Well, your fiancee
was half right.

35:48.063 --> 35:51.832
I did need an X-ray,
but no broken bones.

35:51.899 --> 35:54.935
Just bruising, swelling,
you know.

35:55.003 --> 35:56.870
Dad, I need to apologize.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.405
I...

35:58.473 --> 36:01.074
I was a bit harsh, before.

36:01.109 --> 36:03.177
What, you mean
when you called me an idiot?

36:03.245 --> 36:05.979
Yeah. I'm sorry.

36:06.014 --> 36:08.181
It's just, it's textbook.

36:09.150 --> 36:10.651
Textbook what?

36:10.685 --> 36:12.552
Mid-life crisis.

36:12.620 --> 36:13.820
You...

36:13.855 --> 36:15.122
Oh, I see, you apologized
for calling me an idiot

36:15.156 --> 36:16.890
and now you're calling me
an idiot

36:16.958 --> 36:18.992
with a mid-life crisis?

36:19.994 --> 36:21.327
Okay, you win.

36:22.429 --> 36:25.431
Something did happen
in Moose Jaw.

36:29.303 --> 36:33.072
I found out that Miranda
is seeing a new guy

36:33.106 --> 36:35.175
and it's just...

36:35.209 --> 36:37.277
kinda bothering me.

36:38.745 --> 36:40.012
It's killing me!

36:40.947 --> 36:43.282
Dad, I'm sorry.
I am.

36:44.484 --> 36:47.787
But it's not like you
and Miranda were together.

36:47.821 --> 36:49.655
It's the guy.

36:49.690 --> 36:51.356
He's-
it's just bad!

36:51.424 --> 36:53.325
How bad?

36:54.961 --> 36:57.496
He's a lawyer.

36:57.530 --> 36:59.431
A young lawyer.

36:59.465 --> 37:03.034
Much younger than me
and very successful.

37:03.969 --> 37:07.138
Anyway, I know I shouldn't
let it bother me.

37:07.173 --> 37:09.040
You know, I'm gettin' over it,

37:09.075 --> 37:10.242
I just...
It...

37:10.310 --> 37:12.578
Look, if there is ever
anything that I can do,

37:12.612 --> 37:14.645
just let me know.

37:16.515 --> 37:18.917
Well, to tell you the truth,
there is one thing

37:18.951 --> 37:20.551
that's still kinda bugging me.

37:23.122 --> 37:25.824
<i>Isn't he something?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

37:26.759 --> 37:29.860
He qualified for
the working cow horse jubilee.

37:29.894 --> 37:31.662
- Is that so?
- Yup.

37:32.731 --> 37:38.102
<i>Yeah, and I figure that now</i>
<i>that you're a mid-life cowboy,</i>

37:38.136 --> 37:40.070
that you'd appreciate
a viewing.

37:40.138 --> 37:43.107
Well, if he's such
a good horse,

37:43.141 --> 37:44.942
why are you trying to sell him?

37:44.976 --> 37:49.679
I think I know you well
enough now to confess that...

37:49.748 --> 37:53.516
I'm just not enough cowboy
for that horse.

37:55.519 --> 37:56.887
You are.

37:59.290 --> 38:01.191
So...

38:01.226 --> 38:04.160
how much are you asking?

38:04.228 --> 38:08.265
Well, Dan,
I'm not exactly giving him away.

38:11.407 --> 38:13.836
Good boy.

38:15.237 --> 38:18.569
<i>So I took your advice</i>
<i>and went and got an X-ray.</i>

38:20.041 --> 38:21.675
Great. And?

38:21.742 --> 38:24.344
Total waste of time.

38:24.412 --> 38:28.114
But better safe than sorry,
right?

38:31.648 --> 38:33.328
You know, you keep plugging away
at school,

38:33.353 --> 38:35.221
one of these days you're gonna
be able to afford a truck

38:35.289 --> 38:38.692
that's a little more upscale
than this tin can.

38:38.759 --> 38:41.460
Yeah, Tim, that's the plan.

38:43.664 --> 38:46.632
Ty, I know I'm hard on you
sometimes,

38:46.701 --> 38:50.169
and you know I wouldn't do it
if I knew you couldn't take it.

38:53.273 --> 38:58.811
You know, if I could pick
a guy to marry my daughter,

38:58.878 --> 39:02.548
I couldn't find a son-in-law
that I admire as much as you.

39:02.583 --> 39:05.084
So just... know that.

39:07.420 --> 39:08.921
Well, thanks.

39:08.988 --> 39:11.890
If you need anything,

39:11.925 --> 39:13.391
short term,

39:13.426 --> 39:16.762
don't you be too proud
to ask me for help, okay?

39:19.999 --> 39:21.299
All right.

39:21.334 --> 39:22.567
I appreciate it.

39:22.602 --> 39:26.238
It comes with a warning.
Time-sensitive offer -

39:26.272 --> 39:28.506
I'm feeling a little flush
right now.

39:28.541 --> 39:30.542
<i>I just sold a horse</i>
<i>to Dan Hartfield</i>

39:30.576 --> 39:33.278
for a lot more money
than I paid for it!

39:36.549 --> 39:37.915
Hup! Come on!

39:37.950 --> 39:39.984
Oh, now.
Whoa, whoa!

39:40.018 --> 39:41.652
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

39:41.686 --> 39:44.655
Get over.
Come here, come on!

39:44.689 --> 39:46.323
Come on.

39:46.358 --> 39:48.091
Just hold still.
Hold it!

39:48.126 --> 39:49.693
Get back here!
Get-

39:54.165 --> 39:56.233
Oh, for...

39:58.636 --> 40:00.536
Hey, Jack.
Can you uh...

40:00.571 --> 40:01.905
give me a hand with my horse?

40:01.939 --> 40:05.041
Love to, Dan, but I'm busy.

40:05.076 --> 40:06.843
Busy?!

40:06.878 --> 40:08.344
What do you have to do,

40:08.379 --> 40:10.814
besides cash
your old age pension cheque?

40:11.849 --> 40:14.350
Let me share something
with you, Jack.

40:14.385 --> 40:16.719
By the time
you get to your age,

40:16.754 --> 40:18.154
life really is short.

40:18.188 --> 40:22.925
That's why I won't be wasting
any more of my time with you.

40:23.860 --> 40:26.696
Okay, I get where
this is coming from.

40:26.730 --> 40:28.698
Lisa!

40:28.732 --> 40:31.901
Well, Jack, the truth hurts.

40:31.935 --> 40:34.970
I'm sorry if I burst
your romantic bubble,

40:35.005 --> 40:38.874
but reality is a bitter pill
to swallow.

40:39.810 --> 40:43.478
Let me share something
with you, Dan.

40:45.015 --> 40:48.149
You can say whatever you want,

40:48.184 --> 40:52.554
but all you've ever had going on
with Lisa is money.

40:52.588 --> 40:55.357
Compared to what we've got,

40:55.425 --> 40:58.259
all the money in the world
is just...

40:58.294 --> 41:01.363
well, small potatoes.

41:12.041 --> 41:14.542
I found this on my desk.

41:14.609 --> 41:16.911
I gave this to you.

41:16.946 --> 41:19.547
I know, but I just figured...

41:19.614 --> 41:21.014
what's the point?

41:21.082 --> 41:23.684
So that's why you missed
the last lesson?

41:23.719 --> 41:25.386
I didn't really figure you
for the kind of kid

41:25.454 --> 41:27.621
who would quit
after one rejection,

41:27.689 --> 41:29.623
and it wasn't even
a real rejection!

41:29.691 --> 41:30.825
What do you mean?

41:30.859 --> 41:32.393
It's exactly what I said
from the beginning:

41:32.427 --> 41:34.662
You're too young for the team.

41:34.730 --> 41:36.263
But the trainer was impressed

41:36.331 --> 41:38.298
and wants to see you
again next year.

41:38.366 --> 41:39.733
She said that?

41:39.800 --> 41:41.835
She did.

41:41.903 --> 41:43.837
But there's still a problem.

41:44.805 --> 41:46.073
What is it?

41:46.140 --> 41:48.475
You've already done
the tandem hippodrome,

41:48.542 --> 41:51.544
so you need something new,
something better.

41:51.612 --> 41:54.046
Your very own signature trick.

41:54.081 --> 41:55.548
Like what?

41:55.583 --> 41:57.917
I was thinking...
Roman riding.

41:58.886 --> 42:00.754
Two horses at a dead gallop,

42:00.821 --> 42:03.055
while the rider, that's you,

42:03.123 --> 42:04.657
stands on their backs.

42:04.692 --> 42:05.859
You think I could do that?

42:05.893 --> 42:07.427
Depends.

42:07.495 --> 42:09.996
You need balance, and control,

42:10.063 --> 42:12.198
nerves of steel,

42:12.266 --> 42:13.565
and luck.

42:15.235 --> 42:18.637
Pink was my sister's
lucky colour.

42:22.842 --> 42:27.813
♪ I want you to know
the best part of me ♪

42:28.748 --> 42:31.650
You know, for an old guy,
he looks pretty good.

42:31.684 --> 42:32.751
He'd look even better

42:32.786 --> 42:34.620
if you paid a little
attention to him.

42:34.654 --> 42:36.755
He's a good old faithful horse.

42:36.823 --> 42:39.458
Come here, boy!

42:40.393 --> 42:42.260
Come on!

42:46.799 --> 42:48.099
You see?
Now he's rejecting me.

42:48.134 --> 42:49.534
Well, he's probably
holding a grudge

42:49.601 --> 42:51.403
because you never
gave him a name!

42:51.437 --> 42:54.372
For putting up with me
all these years?

42:54.407 --> 42:57.142
I should call him...

42:57.176 --> 42:58.943
Faithful?
No, dad.

42:58.977 --> 43:00.645
Lifesaver.
Dad.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.348
He's a champ.

43:05.484 --> 43:07.051
Champ.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.486
That's a good name.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.588
Champ. I like it.

43:12.257 --> 43:13.458
Come here, Champ.

43:15.626 --> 43:17.494
Come on, boy!

43:20.531 --> 43:21.865
<i>Come on, Champ! Atta boy!</i>

43:21.933 --> 43:23.434
I think he likes it!

43:26.604 --> 43:28.472
Champ it is.
