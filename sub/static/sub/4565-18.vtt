WEBVTT

00:13.314 --> 00:15.781
HAPPY 14, MAYA!

00:22.723 --> 00:25.357
HOW'S 14?
TELL ME WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 14,

00:25.359 --> 00:26.792
BUT DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING OUT.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.861
SO FAR IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.197
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
I'LL BE THERE SOON,

00:32.199 --> 00:34.366
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
I HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.901
WELL, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,
YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD

00:35.903 --> 00:37.770
TO YOUR MOTHER
FORGETTING YOUR BIRTHDAY.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.638
OH, NO SHE DID NOT!

00:40.908 --> 00:43.058
WHERE YOU GOIN', HONEY?

00:43.059 --> 00:45.209
- MUST TALK TO YOUR MOM.
- MUST NOT GET INVOLVED.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.914
WHY DO YOU TELL ME THESE THINGS
IF YOU DON'T EXPECT ME
TO FIX THEM?

00:48.916 --> 00:51.250
WHEN YOU'RE 14,
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

00:51.252 --> 00:54.253
HOW COULD YOUR MOTHER
FORGET YOUR BIRTHDAY, MAYA?

00:54.255 --> 00:55.621
I'VE STOPPED TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.389
SHE WAS ALREADY GONE
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.458
SHE PROBABLY JUST TOOK
AN EARLY SHIFT AT THE DINER.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.428
RATHER THAN BE THERE
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?  UNH-UH!

01:04.298 --> 01:06.865
RILES, A FRIENDSHIP RING.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.634
- YEAH.
- TWO OF THEM.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.536
- YEAH!
- IN CASE I LOSE ONE.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.471
NO.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.773
- WELL, ANYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE
JUST GOTTEN ME ONE.
- NO.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.241
- OH, I GET IT.
- YEAH.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.277
- ONE FOR EACH HAND.
- NO.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.913
I'LL NEVER TAKE THIS OFF
UNTIL I DIE.

01:20.915 --> 01:24.983
YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE BEFORE ME
SINCE YOU'RE OLDER.

01:24.985 --> 01:29.288
SHOULD I TELL THE PEOPLE
NOT TO TAKE IT OFF YOUR DEAD
CORPSE BODY?

01:29.290 --> 01:30.956
YEAH, WOULD YOU DO THAT
FOR ME?

01:30.958 --> 01:32.991
AND, MAYA, THE OTHER RING--

01:32.993 --> 01:35.461
- IS FOR YOU.
- YEAH.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.696
OH, NO.
IF YOU'RE NOT THERE,

01:37.698 --> 01:41.834
WHO'S GOING TO TELL
THE PEOPLE NOT TO TAKE IT OFF
MY DEAD CORPSE BODY?

01:42.970 --> 01:46.004
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAYA.
- THANKS FOR NOT FORGETTING.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.540
OH, YEAH,
THAT REMINDS ME.

02:58.078 --> 03:01.180
- UNCLE SHAWN!
- HEY THERE.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.982
- HEY.
- HEY.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.452
OKAY.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.454
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.
SQUEEZE HER GOOD.

03:09.456 --> 03:13.458
OH, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KIDDO.
YOU DOING SOMETHING SPECIAL?

03:13.460 --> 03:15.727
THIS IS IT.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.831
HONEY, HIDE THE CAKE
BEFORE MAYA GETS HERE.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.466
I KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

03:21.468 --> 03:22.968
WE SHOULD BRING THIS CAKE
TO MAYA'S MOTHER

03:22.970 --> 03:25.070
JUST IN CASE SHE FORGOT
TO GET HER OWN KID A CAKE.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.039
OH, YOU THINK THAT
COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.941
HONEY, I GREW UP
WITH SHAWN HUNTER.

03:28.943 --> 03:32.077
REMEMBER HIS MOTHER?
SHE FORGOT WHERE SHE LIVED.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.813
SEE, MY BIGGEST WORRY
IS THAT FORGETTING TO
GIVE YOUR KID A CAKE

03:34.815 --> 03:36.982
IS THE FIRST STEP
TO FORGETTING WHERE YOU LIVE.

03:36.984 --> 03:41.086
OH, THAT'S NOT
YOUR BIGGEST WORRY ANYMORE.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.488
MAYA'S BEHIND ME,
ISN'T SHE?

03:43.490 --> 03:46.692
WHY IS EVERYBODY
ALWAYS BEHIND ME?

03:46.694 --> 03:50.062
OKAY, MAYA,
I'M NOT GOING TO TURN AROUND
BECAUSE I'M ALL EMBARRASSED,

03:50.064 --> 03:51.863
BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.498
I KNOW YOU DO.
YOU ALWAYS DEFEND HER.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.434
- BECAUSE AT LEAST SHE'S NOT...
- NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE!

03:55.436 --> 03:57.769
- STOP TALKING.
- ...SHAWN'S MOTHER!

03:57.771 --> 03:59.771
<i>WHAT A CUCKOO.</i>

03:59.773 --> 04:02.541
"AH, IT'S TUESDAY!
I BETTER RUN AWAY!"

04:02.543 --> 04:05.877
( laughs )
YOU HAVE TO LAUGH,
HUH, TOPANGA?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.683
NICE FACE.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.186
YOU WANT TO TURN AROUND
OR YOU WANT ME TO
TURN YOU AROUND?

04:14.188 --> 04:17.155
HOW YOU DOIN', SHAWN?

04:17.157 --> 04:20.692
WELL, IT AIN'T TUESDAY,
SO PRETTY GOOD.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.163
- SHAWNY!
- AH!

04:26.700 --> 04:29.101
HOW YOU DOIN', BUDDY?

04:29.103 --> 04:30.802
JUST HERE DOING A PHOTO ESSAY--

04:30.804 --> 04:33.572
"WEEKENDS IN NEW YORK
FOR UNDER $100."

04:33.574 --> 04:35.707
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
CAN I STAY HERE?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.077
WE FOUND HIM ON THE COUCH.
CAN WE KEEP HIM?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.913
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHO LET YOU IN?

04:41.915 --> 04:44.216
- I HAVE A KEY.
- YOU GAVE HIM A KEY?

04:44.218 --> 04:47.019
FINE, I'LL GIVE YOU A KEY.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.054
YOU LOVE ME!

04:49.056 --> 04:50.756
I DO LOVE YOU.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.025
YOU HAVE THE KEY
TO MY HEART.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.666
SO WHO HAS THE KEY
TO YOUR HEART?

05:01.702 --> 05:04.236
YEAH, YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE
OR WHAT?

05:04.238 --> 05:07.105
- ANGELA TIME?
- SEEMS UNAVOIDABLE.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.840
ANGELA-- SPILL IT.

05:08.842 --> 05:13.245
YEAH, WAS SHE ALL TORTURED
POET-WANDERER-FEMALE-YOU TYPE?

05:13.247 --> 05:15.113
YOU GUYS WANT TO KNOW
HOW THEY FELL IN LOVE?

05:15.115 --> 05:17.616
HE WENT THROUGH HER PURSE.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.118
WHAT?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.621
I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.924
GIRLS, TRUST US,
IT WAS VERY ROMANTIC
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.960
SO BASICALLY HE FELL IN LOVE
WITH A CONCEPT?

05:28.962 --> 05:31.063
- IT WAS DOOMED FROM THE START.
- NEVER LET ME DO THAT.

05:31.065 --> 05:33.732
I WOULD KILL IT IMMEDIATELY.
THAT'S WHAT BEST FRIENDS
ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.200
- RING POWER!
- RING POWER!

05:35.202 --> 05:37.269
- THUNDER!
- LIGHTNING!

05:40.774 --> 05:41.940
SO WHERE'S ANGELA NOW?

05:41.942 --> 05:44.109
I DON'T KNOW.
I TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.578
- BUT YOU COULDN'T COMMIT?
- NO.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.280
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE IT
ALL WRONG ABOUT ME.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.915
I-- I WAS ALL IN.

05:49.917 --> 05:53.118
SHE'S THE ONE WHO LEFT.
I GOT LEFT.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.721
YEAH, I--
I GET A LOT OF THAT TOO.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.522
WHO'S ON YOUR LIST?

05:57.524 --> 06:00.258
MOTHER, FATHER, GIRLFRIEND.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.829
WOW.
WHAT IS IT WITH US?

06:03.831 --> 06:05.263
( laughs )

06:05.265 --> 06:07.966
WHAT IS IT WITH US?

06:08.902 --> 06:12.671
WINDOW!
WINDOW RIGHT NOW!

06:13.807 --> 06:15.073
NOT YOU.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.042
BUT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.177
YEAH, I KNOW.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.747
- YOU.
- REALLY?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.248
- AND YOU!
- OH, BOY!

06:28.889 --> 06:31.890
OKAY, I HAVE HEARD
ALL OF THE STORIES.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.025
BUT TELL ME THE TRUTH, MOM.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.560
WHEN YOU GUYS WERE MY AGE,

06:35.562 --> 06:38.063
WAS DAD REALLY THAT GOOD
AT SCHEMES?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.482
SCHEMES?

06:40.483 --> 06:42.900
YOU KNOW, RACKETS,
SCAMS, PULLING STUFF ON PEOPLE,

06:42.903 --> 06:45.036
CHANGING THEIR LIVES.

06:45.038 --> 06:50.008
COREY MATTHEWS WAS THE BEST
THERE EVER WAS.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.344
- WHY?
- WELL, BECAUSE WHEN
HE BELIEVES IN SOMETHING,

06:52.346 --> 06:54.946
HIS WILL IS STRONGER
THAN ANYBODY'S.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.115
I'M RETIRED.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.352
BUT WHAT IF I BELIEVED
IN SOMETHING?

07:00.354 --> 07:03.755
YOUR MOVE.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.957
RILEY, YOU WANT TO PULL ME
BACK IN THE GAME,

07:05.959 --> 07:09.060
THEN THIS HAS TO BE MONUMENTAL.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.097
A SCHEME OF SCHEMES.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.233
<i>SCHEMETATA DE SCHEMETATA.</i>

07:16.136 --> 07:17.369
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

07:17.371 --> 07:19.137
HE'S MAKING IT UP.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.841
A SCHEME THAT MAKES
THE ANGELS SING.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.610
OTHERWISE, I'M OUT FOREVER.
YOU HEAR ME?!

07:27.381 --> 07:30.715
NOW YOU'VE GOT ONE MINUTE,
RILEY.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.918
WOW ME.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.153
I WANT SHAWN
TO BE MAYA'S DAD.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.126
WOW.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.101
RILEY, YOU CAN'T JUST
WANT SHAWN TO BE MAYA'S FATHER.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.071
YOUR DAD CAN'T POSSIBLY
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.  CAN YOU?

07:53.073 --> 07:55.073
TOUGH ONE.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.143
IT'S THE STUFF
LEGENDS ARE MADE OF.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.145
BUT IF WE CAN PULL IT OFF,

08:00.147 --> 08:03.081
IT WOULD MAKE THE ANGELS SING.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.151
<i>( horn music playing )</i>

08:07.387 --> 08:09.654
I WANT TO DO THIS
WITH YOU, DAD.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.124
TEACH ME.
I WANT TO DO IT FOR MAYA.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.194
<i>( music continues )</i>

08:17.764 --> 08:20.866
RILEY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET YOUR HOPES UP.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.034
BUT IF THERE IS ANYONE
IN THE WORLD

08:23.036 --> 08:26.671
WHO HAS A CHANCE
OF PULLING THIS OFF, IT'S HIM.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.108
<i>( music continues )</i>

08:31.178 --> 08:33.178
WELL, THE BEST MASTER PLAN

08:33.180 --> 08:36.081
INVOLVES HOW WELL
WE KNOW OUR TWO SUBJECTS.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.217
<i>( music continues )</i>

08:42.022 --> 08:44.289
WE GOT RINGS.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.957
SO DO WE.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.294
SHAWN GAVE ME MINE
WHEN I WAS 25 YEARS OLD.

08:50.397 --> 08:53.098
YOUR MOTHER
WON'T LET ME WEAR IT.

08:54.401 --> 08:57.936
OKAY, SO THE NEXT STEP
IN OUR PLAN

08:57.938 --> 09:00.038
IS WE NEED A CUTTING-EDGE
TECH GUY.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.241
- LADIES!
- All: FARKLE!

09:03.243 --> 09:05.176
WANT TO SEE
MY NEW COMPUTER WATCH?

09:05.178 --> 09:07.012
SURE, IT LOOKS LIKE
AN OLD CALCULATOR WATCH,

09:07.014 --> 09:10.081
BUT I UPDATED THE HARD DRIVE
AND ADDED AN INTERESTING
NEW FEATURE.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.184
- <i> ( watch beeps )</i>
- Voice: <i> Riley is</i>
<i>within five feet of you.</i>

09:13.186 --> 09:15.987
HEY, THAT'S MY VOICE.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.989
YEAH, I'VE BEEN RECORDING IT
FOR YEARS.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.025
BUT DON'T WORRY, I WOULD NEVER
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.826
- <i> ( beeps )</i>
- <i> I love you, Farkle.</i>

09:23.263 --> 09:25.797
WELL, I GUESS WE FOUND
OUR TECH GUY.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.069
<i>( music continues )</i>

09:31.071 --> 09:32.971
SO THE TEAM'S COMPLETE.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.406
NOT QUITE YET, RILEY.

09:34.408 --> 09:38.076
SEE, THE BEST MASTER PLAN
USUALLY INVOLVES A DISTRACTION.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.146
AND USUALLY IT COMES
IN THE FORM OF A PRETTY FACE.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.148
OH, YOU GUYS.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.483
HI, EVERYBODY.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.054
YEAH, OKAY.

09:49.056 --> 09:53.058
<i>( music continues )</i>

09:53.994 --> 09:55.527
THAT'S HOW YOU THINK OF ME?

09:55.529 --> 09:57.228
A LOT OF THE TIME, YEAH.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.463
OKAY.

10:03.837 --> 10:07.372
I NEVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN MY MOM AND DAD.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.174
SHE JUST TELLS ME
NOT TO BE UPSET WITH HIM

10:09.176 --> 10:11.193
AND NEVER WANTS
TO GO INTO DETAILS.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.211
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE SHE DID SOMETHING
TO MAKE HIM LEAVE.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.280
YOU AND I ARE THE ONES
THAT GET LEFT,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.182
NOT LIKE HER.

10:17.184 --> 10:20.118
THAT'S WHY WE
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

10:21.254 --> 10:23.788
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

10:23.790 --> 10:26.024
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.
AND WHEN DID YOU GUYS SHOW UP?

10:26.026 --> 10:28.126
YOU'VE ALL BEEN IN THERE TALKING
FOR THE PAST HOUR?

10:28.128 --> 10:31.363
ACTUALLY, WE SAID
WHAT WE NEEDED TO SAY
IN 10 MINUTES.

10:31.365 --> 10:34.366
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN TALKING
FOR THE PAST HOUR, THOUGH.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.568
YEAH, WELL,
YOU WOULDN'T LET US
IN YOUR ROOM,

10:36.570 --> 10:38.937
SO IT'S LIKE
YOU TRAPPED US OUT HERE.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.023
UH-HUH.

10:41.024 --> 10:43.108
SO OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING
FOR THE PAST HOUR.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.443
ACTUALLY,
ACCORDING TO MY WATCH,
IT'S ONLY BEEN--

10:45.445 --> 10:48.847
- <i> ( beeping )</i>
- Maya's voice: <i> Maya is</i>
<i>within five feet of you.</i>

10:48.849 --> 10:51.383
WHAT THE--

10:51.385 --> 10:53.284
Watch:
<i>Danger danger!</i>

10:55.522 --> 10:57.288
( Velcro ripping )

11:04.898 --> 11:06.831
<i>I love you, Farkle.</i>

11:06.833 --> 11:09.134
YEAH, OKAY.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.503
RILEY, I THOUGHT WE WERE
DOING SOMETHING FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

11:11.505 --> 11:15.306
YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE
SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.909
HEY, COR.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.211
DO YOU KNOW MAYA'S MOTHER
MISSED HER BIRTHDAY?

11:20.213 --> 11:21.913
I DO.
I DO KNOW.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.448
THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT MAYA
A CAKE.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.150
WHAT, THAT'S IT?
THAT'S ALL YOU DID?

11:25.152 --> 11:27.152
WELL, YOU KNOW ME, SHAWN.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.521
I DON'T LIKE TO MEDDLE.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.089
WHAT?!

11:31.091 --> 11:32.357
WHAT'S BECOME OF YOU?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.893
I'M RETIRED.
I'M OUT.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.629
WHAT?
YOU TWO, WINDOW!

11:37.631 --> 11:40.899
- US?
- WHATEVER FOR?

11:40.901 --> 11:43.068
WINDOW NOW!

11:46.239 --> 11:48.206
- YOU THREE.
- All: US?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.607
WINDOW NOW.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.511
THE COREY MATTHEWS I KNEW

11:53.513 --> 11:56.214
WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY
TAKEN THIS LITTLE GIRL
UNDER HIS WING

11:56.216 --> 11:58.483
AND BECOME KIND OF
A FATHER FIGURE TO HER.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.218
- I'M OLD.
- HE'S TIRED.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.120
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.621
- I'M TIRED.
- HE'S OLD!

12:03.623 --> 12:05.523
COME ON, MAN!

12:05.525 --> 12:07.592
WE WERE KINGS!

12:09.196 --> 12:12.430
THIS COULD BE THE RETURN
OF COREY AND SHAWN.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.099
- HMM.
- COME ON!

12:14.101 --> 12:17.902
LET'S YOU AND ME FIX THINGS
BETWEEN MAYA AND HER MOTHER.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.038
HMM.  YOU DON'T THINK
WE'RE TOO OLD

12:20.040 --> 12:22.540
FOR SUCH HIGH JINKS
AND SHENANIGANS?

12:22.542 --> 12:25.143
IS MAYA NOT WORTH IT TO YOU?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.277
IS SHE WORTH IT TO YOU?

12:26.279 --> 12:29.080
YEAH.
I LIKE HER VERY MUCH.

12:29.082 --> 12:33.451
DOESN'T SHE REMIND YOU
OF SOMEONE?

12:33.453 --> 12:37.055
YEAH, WHAT CAN I SAY?
I LIKE PEOPLE THAT
REMIND ME OF ME.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.991
- DO I REMIND YOU OF YOU?
- NO.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.364
YOU KNOW,
IF THIS WERE THE OLD DAYS,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.399
I PROBABLY MIGHT CONSIDER
VISITING KATY...

12:48.401 --> 12:49.567
HER MOTHER'S NAME IS KATY.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.935
...IN THE DINER
WHERE SHE WORKS.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.504
THE NIGHTHAWK DINER
OVER ON 17th STREET.

12:52.506 --> 12:54.239
BUT AGAIN, I'M TOO OLD.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.274
HE NEEDS HIS SLEEP.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.642
WELL, I DON'T.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.477
AND I'M DISGUSTED WITH YOU.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.479
HE JUST NEEDS A LITTLE NAPPY
BEFORE BED.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.649
GOOD JOB.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.184
( snoring )

13:06.186 --> 13:07.285
SERIOUSLY?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.220
YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP YIP.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.228
YOU WANT TO SEE A ROPE TRICK?

13:19.132 --> 13:22.066
MAYA, IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU KNOW

13:22.068 --> 13:25.136
THAT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO
TO YOU IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.038
<i>( watch beeps )</i>

13:27.040 --> 13:28.973
Riley's voice:
<i>Maya, it's important</i>
<i>that you know</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:31.209
<i>that what we're about to do</i>
<i>to you is for your own good.</i>

13:31.211 --> 13:32.644
- <i> ( beeping )</i>
- FARKLE.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.546
I'M THE WONK!

13:34.548 --> 13:37.215
OKAY, I GET IT.
NOW WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.150
YOU WANT TO SEE A ROPE TRICK?

13:39.152 --> 13:42.187
WILL YOU STOP DISTRACTING ME
WITH THAT?

13:42.189 --> 13:44.255
IT'S NOT LIKE I ACTUALLY
BELIEVED YOU'RE A REAL COWBOY.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.124
YEAH, 'CAUSE IF I WAS,

13:46.126 --> 13:47.492
THEN I COULD DO THIS.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.773
WHY DID YOU TIE ME UP?

14:01.775 --> 14:05.443
OH, SHAWN'S GOING
TO MEET YOUR MOTHER.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.213
( growling )

14:08.215 --> 14:10.481
WHY WOULD YOU WANT HIM
TO MEET MY MOTHER?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.350
MY MOTHER DRIVES MEN AWAY.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.185
THIS WILL END UP
JUST LIKE MY FATHER, RILEY!

14:14.187 --> 14:15.520
SHAWN WILL RUN FOR THE HILLS!

14:15.522 --> 14:18.590
RUN FOR THE HILLS?
WHO SAYS RUN FOR THE HILLS?

14:18.592 --> 14:20.225
( growling )

14:20.227 --> 14:21.759
RUN FOR THE HILLS!

14:39.546 --> 14:42.747
- KATY?
- THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS
RIGHT HERE.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.716
- YEAH?
- HI.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.318
HI.
WHAT'LL IT BE?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.263
OH, ME?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.598
I'LL HAVE SOME BIRTHDAY CAKE.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.166
WHAT?

15:02.168 --> 15:05.103
WHAT KIND OF MOM ARE YOU, KATY?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.772
WHAT?

15:07.774 --> 15:11.175
HEY, UNLESS YOUR BUSINESS
WITH ME

15:11.177 --> 15:13.211
IS TUNA MELT, MEATLOAF OR PIE,

15:13.213 --> 15:16.180
YOU CAN WALK YOUR NOSY
LITTLE BUTT RIGHT OUT OF HERE.

15:29.829 --> 15:32.263
WHO ARE YOU, BUDDY?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.132
MY NAME'S SHAWN HUNTER.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.601
- WHOA.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHOA?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.836
YOU'RE THE GUY MAYA
DOESN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT,

15:38.838 --> 15:40.338
THE MATTHEWS' FRIEND.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.207
YOU GUYS ALL WENT
ON A FAMILY WEEKEND TOGETHER.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.643
SHE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME
AND I APPRECIATE IT.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.145
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.730
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:48.731 --> 15:50.314
AND IF YOU EVER QUESTION
MY MOTHERHOOD AGAIN,

15:50.317 --> 15:52.650
I WILL SMASH A PLATE
OVER YOUR HEAD.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.652
YOU KNOW WHAT, LADY?

15:54.654 --> 15:56.421
YOU ALREADY DON'T LIKE ME,

15:56.423 --> 15:58.523
SO I'M JUST GOING
TO KEEP TALKING, OKAY?

15:58.525 --> 16:00.692
TODAY IS MAYA'S BIRTHDAY.

16:00.694 --> 16:03.294
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
SINCE FIRST THING THIS MORNING?

16:04.230 --> 16:07.332
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.201
I DON'T LIKE YOU AT ALL.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.238
SHOW'S OVER.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.174
LET'S MOVE.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.723
WHOA.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.363
MAYA, I TRIED.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.164
IT DIDN'T WORK.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.501
RILEY, I TOLD YOU,
SOME THINGS CAN'T BE FIXED.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.204
SHE DOES THIS.
SHE MAKES MEN LEAVE.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.239
SHAWN'S PROBABLY
IN MEXICO BY NOW.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.807
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.676
YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.178
I AM.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.284
HOW ABOUT NOW?

17:02.522 --> 17:03.988
RIGHT NOW I'M KIND OF,
LIKE, FURIOUS.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.258
- SHOULD I UNTIE YOU THEN?
- I WOULDN'T.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.942
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE ME BACK
THE FRIENDSHIP RING,
I'LL UNDERSTAND.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.979
I AM NEVER
GIVING THIS FRIENDSHIP RING BACK
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

17:27.981 --> 17:31.482
WOW, YOU SAID KIND OF
A NICE THING IN A REALLY
MEAN VOICE.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.551
RILEY, PEOPLE ONLY GET UPSET
WITH EACH OTHER

17:33.553 --> 17:35.987
WHEN WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
IS IMPORTANT TO THEM.

17:35.989 --> 17:39.223
HUH.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.992
THEN MAYBE THERE'S STILL HOPE.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.796
THANK YOU FOR UNTYING ME.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.564
ARE YOU STILL ANGRY AT ME?

17:46.566 --> 17:49.333
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
YES!

17:52.906 --> 17:55.006
SO DO YOU WANT
TO SLEEP OVER?

17:59.946 --> 18:02.480
DO YOU THINK
I WOULD WALK IN HERE
AND TALK TO YOU LIKE THIS

18:02.482 --> 18:04.549
IF I WASN'T
SO FOND OF YOUR DAUGHTER?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.417
OH, YOU'RE FOND OF MY DAUGHTER.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.354
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR VAST EXPERIENCE
RAISING A CHILD?

18:10.356 --> 18:12.323
I DON'T HAVE ANY!

18:12.325 --> 18:15.626
BUT I KNOW YOU DON'T WORK
AN EXTRA SHIFT AT A DINER

18:15.628 --> 18:18.179
AND MISS
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.731
MM-HMM.  AND YOU KNOW THIS
BECAUSE YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.700
- I'M TERRIBLE AT RELATIONSHIPS.
- I'M WORSE.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.368
- I DON'T WANT TO BE.
- NEITHER DO I.

18:24.370 --> 18:27.271
WELL, THEN WE'VE GOT
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

18:30.009 --> 18:33.945
LOOK, MY DAUGHTER LIKES
HAVING YOU AROUND.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.047
BUT HOW CAN YOU STICK AROUND

18:36.049 --> 18:39.016
WHEN EVERY WEEKEND SHE TOLD ME
YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?

18:39.018 --> 18:41.018
I WRITE ABOUT PLACES.
THAT'S MY JOB.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.522
I CAN'T LET MAYA
GET CLOSE TO SOMEBODY ELSE
WHO JUST LEAVES.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.024
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT A LEAVER.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.993
ALL RIGHT?
I'M A STAYER.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.395
I'M THE ONE
WHO GETS LEFT.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.900
WELL, WE GOT THAT
IN COMMON TOO.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.034
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:57.036 --> 18:58.736
MAYA THINKS
THAT YOU CHASED AWAY--

18:58.738 --> 19:00.938
I KNOW WHAT SHE THINKS.
IT'S HER FATHER.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.675
A GIRL SHOULD THINK WELL
OF HER FATHER.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.781
HI, KATY.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.084
SO I FINISHED IT

19:13.086 --> 19:15.586
AND IT'S JUST
LIKE YOU WANTED IT.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.421
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, CAMILLE.

19:17.423 --> 19:20.091
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

19:20.093 --> 19:22.026
BUT I'M STILL $50 SHORT

19:22.028 --> 19:24.595
AND IT'LL TAKE
AN EXTRA SHIFT TO PAY FOR IT.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.498
IT'S A NICE LOCKET.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.001
FAMILY PHOTO GOING IN THERE?

19:30.003 --> 19:31.369
YEAH.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.837
HER AND ME.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.407
HERE YOU GO.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.942
REALLY?

19:37.944 --> 19:40.011
TODAY IS HER BIRTHDAY.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.979
BUT YOU KNEW THAT.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.715
HE'S CUTE.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.087
I'LL PAY YOU BACK.

19:50.089 --> 19:53.724
YOU WILL.
YOU'LL LET ME TAKE THE PHOTO.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.066
WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A BIRTHDAY YOU'D NEVER FORGET,
MAYA.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.868
I APPRECIATE IT.
I DO.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.471
SOME THINGS
ARE JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.607
I USED TO NOT BELIEVE THAT.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.510
I STILL DON'T.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.679
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.380
EVERYTHING YOU THINK
IS WRONG.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.050
I ASKED YOU NOT TO TELL HER.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

20:19.052 --> 20:21.619
BECAUSE SHE DESERVES TO LOVE
THE PARENT WHO STAYED.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.822
WHAT?

20:24.824 --> 20:28.759
YOUR MOTHER HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR FATHER LEAVING, MAYA.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.428
ALL RIGHT?
ALL THIS TIME

20:30.430 --> 20:32.496
SHE'S JUST BEEN PROTECTING HIM
FOR YOU.

20:34.601 --> 20:38.102
MOM?
YOU GOT LEFT?

20:38.104 --> 20:41.138
I'M SORRY.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.476
SHE'S ONE OF US.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.114
COME HERE.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.924
I COULDN'T AFFORD TO GET YOU
WHAT YOU WANTED

20:59.926 --> 21:02.260
WITHOUT WORKING
A COUPLE EXTRA SHIFTS,

21:02.262 --> 21:04.228
BUT I GOT IT, HONEY.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.163
SHAWN HELPED ME.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.665
A LOCKET?

21:07.667 --> 21:09.734
- YEAH.
- WHERE IS IT?

21:09.736 --> 21:11.869
- IT'S IN MY PURSE.
- I'LL GET IT.

21:11.871 --> 21:15.006
YOU CAN'T GO
THROUGH MY PURSE.

21:15.008 --> 21:17.475
Both:
LET HIM!

21:41.534 --> 21:43.567
DID YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE,
COR?

21:43.569 --> 21:45.670
I GOT MAYA
AND HER MOTHER TOGETHER.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.172
YEAH.
YOU DID GREAT, SHAWN.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.841
WELL, I'D BE HAPPY TO
INCLUDE YOU IN MY NEXT SCHEME.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.077
SORRY, BUDDY.

21:55.581 --> 21:58.082
I GOT ME A NEW PARTNER NOW.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.051
SO YOU'RE WITH HER NOW, HUH?

22:00.053 --> 22:02.186
ME AND HER.

22:03.256 --> 22:04.855
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.624
COME ON!

22:06.626 --> 22:11.062
WHAT FUN IS PULLING OFF SCHEMES
BY YOURSELF?

22:12.131 --> 22:14.999
OH, IT'S YOU AND ME NOW?

22:15.001 --> 22:16.500
WELL, HEY,

22:16.502 --> 22:20.104
I'M IN THE MARKET
FOR A NEW PARTNER IN CRIME.

22:20.106 --> 22:23.174
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TRY YOU OUT
AND SEE HOW YOU DO.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.976
CAKE TIME.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.746
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
BABY GIRL.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.648
MAKE A WISH.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.727
WOW.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.963
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN HARDLY MOVE.

22:47.100 --> 22:50.101
I SEE WHY YOU WERE
KIND OF FURIOUS AT ME.

22:50.103 --> 22:52.870
UH-HUH.  UH-HUH.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.540
AND I CAN SEE WHY YOU WANTED
TO TIE ME UP TOO,

22:56.542 --> 23:00.044
SO I COULD
SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.714
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT US
TO SHARE EVERY EXPERIENCE

23:03.716 --> 23:05.783
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS,

23:05.785 --> 23:07.618
WITH FRIENDSHIP RINGS!

23:10.123 --> 23:14.091
MAYA, COULD YOU AT LEAST
SAY ONE WORD TO ME?

23:14.093 --> 23:17.061
GOOD NIGHT.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.067
MY NOSE ITCHES.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.975
THANK YOU.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
