(determined music)

00:16.058 --> 00:18.811
(keys tapping)

01:12.072 --> 01:15.075
(light buzzing)

01:15.159 --> 01:17.995
(light gentle music)

01:32.343 --> 01:34.887
(kids chattering)

01:42.895 --> 01:44.688
- [Teacher] And the right
side of the meridian

01:44.772 --> 01:47.441
is called the
Eastern hemisphere.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.741
- Today we are going to learn
how to create a text box.

01:55.825 --> 01:58.160
Use the text box
tool to start writing

01:58.244 --> 02:01.247
the first paragraph
of the essay.

02:01.330 --> 02:05.668
Make sure you put your name
and the date at the top.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.127
(quirky music)

03:21.410 --> 03:23.996
(watch beeping)

03:53.776 --> 03:54.568
(phone ringing)

03:54.652 --> 03:56.111
- Edward Middle School.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.239
Hi Ms. Annie, I'm
sorry, but the principle

03:59.323 --> 04:00.699
stepped out of the office.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.034
Can I have him call you back?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.203
Thank you, bye bye.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.041
(screen beeping)

04:11.377 --> 04:14.380
(suspenseful music)

04:21.595 --> 04:23.097
(intercom static)

04:23.180 --> 04:25.265
- [Male] This is Mr.
Barnaby your principle

04:25.349 --> 04:27.643
here at Edward Middle School.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.604
I have a special
announcement for you.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.022
(Mexican mariachi music)

04:32.106 --> 04:34.650
(kids laughing)

04:55.754 --> 04:58.632
- I don't know how
to make this stop!

05:09.309 --> 05:12.062
(quirky music)

05:14.898 --> 05:17.067
- Josh, I think
you left this here.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.740
Josh, why would you do this?

05:22.823 --> 05:25.117
- To celebrate Cinco De Mayo.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.869
- Very funny.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.329
That was three weeks ago,

05:29.413 --> 05:31.331
and you don't even like
that type of music.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.547
I can see here Josh that
you're a bright student,

05:38.630 --> 05:40.799
except in history.

05:41.717 --> 05:45.220
And you're very
strong in technology,

05:45.304 --> 05:48.307
except you're not doing
anything with those talents.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.560
You're just wasting
it on doing pranks.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.354
This is third time this year

05:54.438 --> 05:58.192
that you've tried to pull
your little technology pranks.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.028
I'm going to have
to call your father.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.574
Let's see what he has
to say about this.

06:07.785 --> 06:10.412
(upbeat music)

06:11.914 --> 06:15.709
(singing in foreign language)

06:17.795 --> 06:20.464
(horn honking)

06:22.382 --> 06:25.594
- Oh yes sir, I am
planning to go in person

06:25.677 --> 06:27.471
to Michigan this Friday

06:27.554 --> 06:29.139
to see if he'll sign the deal.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.392
Well, with that
kind of a bonus sir,

06:32.476 --> 06:33.727
I'm gonna do everything I can

06:33.811 --> 06:35.813
to make sure he agrees to it.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.147
(phone calling)

06:37.231 --> 06:39.399
Sorry sir, it looks
like it's the principal

06:39.483 --> 06:41.026
of my sons school calling.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.236
Can I call you back?

06:42.319 --> 06:43.028
- [Male] Sure.

06:43.112 --> 06:44.363
- Alright.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.989
Vargas, go.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.617
- [Barnaby] Hello Mr. Vargas,
this is Principle Barnaby.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.869
We have a little problem.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.704
We need to talk about Josh.

06:53.372 --> 06:57.167
(singing in foreign language)

07:12.099 --> 07:13.851
- Do you know how
embarrassing it is

07:13.934 --> 07:15.477
to get a call from
your principle?

07:16.854 --> 07:19.022
- Since when did you care
about what I do in school?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.567
All you care about
is not looking bad.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.569
- Watch your mouth Josh!

07:23.652 --> 07:25.362
- Listen, that's what you think,

07:25.445 --> 07:26.947
but I need to be
able to concentrate

07:27.030 --> 07:28.490
on doing my work.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.576
I can't be getting calls
from your principle

07:30.659 --> 07:33.203
telling me about your
little spy pranks.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.414
And besides that, he
tells me that you're

07:35.497 --> 07:37.833
currently failing history?

07:37.916 --> 07:40.002
- What do you have
to say for yourself?

07:40.085 --> 07:40.794
- What?

07:40.878 --> 07:42.462
I got an F, big deal.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.506
- That is a big deal.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.800
And what about your
little spy prank?

07:46.884 --> 07:49.011
(slow paced music)

07:49.094 --> 07:50.762
- What are you going
to do with him?

07:52.055 --> 07:55.267
Okay, here's what's
going to happen.

07:55.350 --> 07:59.396
First of all Joshua, no
video games for two weeks.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.023
- Mom!

08:01.106 --> 08:03.650
- And, if you do not ace
your history presentation,

08:03.734 --> 08:06.278
you will not have video
games for the whole summer.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.197
And I'll take away all
your little spy toys

08:08.280 --> 08:09.448
for the whole summer too.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.699
- That's not fair!

08:10.782 --> 08:12.409
- And playing
disrespectful pranks

08:12.492 --> 08:14.328
on your principle is fair?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.162
- That's final.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
- Okay, it wasn't me.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.508
- Well, since you're
here now Jessy,

08:28.592 --> 08:30.427
this Friday I have
a business meeting

08:30.510 --> 08:32.054
in a small town in Michigan,

08:32.136 --> 08:33.513
just a few hours away from here.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.183
But I figure since you
have a long weekend,

08:36.265 --> 08:38.268
we can all go out
together on Thursday

08:38.352 --> 08:39.937
and come back on Friday.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.520
- Dad!
- Awe Dad!

08:41.605 --> 08:42.898
- [Dad] Come on buys,
you're always complaining

08:42.981 --> 08:44.483
that I'm always too busy.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.069
This is a time that we can
go and do something together.

08:47.152 --> 08:50.155
- Dad, that usually means
doing something fun.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.324
- You heard your father,
we are going with him.

08:57.996 --> 08:58.872
The country?

08:59.748 --> 09:03.335
Aren't there animals and bugs?

09:03.418 --> 09:04.836
And where are we gonna stay?

09:05.796 --> 09:08.131
- Well, there's no
hotels in this town,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.008
but I did find a
nice vacation rental

09:10.092 --> 09:11.885
that we can rent for the night.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.512
- A town with no hotels!

09:13.595 --> 09:15.013
That's my worst nightmare!

09:17.557 --> 09:18.558
- Is everyone ready!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.144
- And this one.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.355
- Hun, we're just
going for one day.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.190
- True, I forgot
a few more things.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.360
We need to be
ready for anything.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.486
- Two weeks of anything.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.325
(quirky music)

09:49.631 --> 09:51.216
- Are you sure about this
place you're renting?

09:51.300 --> 09:54.720
- Hun, there is nothing
else in this town.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.972
Don't worry, it looked great.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.307
- In the pictures.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.725
- That's what I'm worried about.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.768
Anyone can use
Photoshop nowadays.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.271
- Okay everyone, settle down.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.398
We'll know in a moment,
we're almost there.

10:13.405 --> 10:17.200
- [Jessy] Dad, I thought you
said we were almost there?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.368
- [Mom] I'm not gonna
be happy if a lion

10:18.452 --> 10:20.454
jumps out all of a sudden.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.747
- [Josh] That would be cool.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.884
Not bad dad.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.012
- Way to go Pops.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.847
- Are you sure you
got the right address?

10:42.851 --> 10:44.144
I'm slightly impressed,

10:44.227 --> 10:45.771
but there is
(owl hooting)

10:45.854 --> 10:47.022
a lot of creatures in here.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.691
(Mom screams)

10:49.775 --> 10:51.109
- [Dad] What happened?

10:51.193 --> 10:52.277
- I think there was a squirrel.

10:58.909 --> 10:59.910
- What?

10:59.993 --> 11:00.869
What's the matter?

11:00.952 --> 11:02.371
- Dad, there's no signal here.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.039
- There's not even wifi.

11:04.122 --> 11:07.292
- Come on guys, it's
like an adventure.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.337
- [Family] We don't
like adventure.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.839
(quirky music)

11:18.345 --> 11:20.764
- Come on hun, this
is a nice place.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.682
There's no critters in here.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.101
- Well, we'll see.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.690
(Mom giggling)

11:30.774 --> 11:31.858
- [Dad] What?

11:31.942 --> 11:33.318
- [Mom] Stop tickling my feet.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.654
- Hun, I'm not in bed yet.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.072
(Mom screaming)

11:37.155 --> 11:38.824
(Dad laughing)

11:38.907 --> 11:41.284
(light music)

12:14.443 --> 12:16.778
Mr. Thomas, when
you bought the store

12:16.862 --> 12:20.407
we assumed you would run the
store a little differently.

12:20.490 --> 12:24.119
We're hearing reports about
some unusual practices here.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.538
As you know, we sent
you an email last week.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.623
Our investors are a
little bit worried,

12:28.707 --> 12:32.878
and basically, we either need
you to pay back the loan,

12:32.961 --> 12:34.921
or you need to return
the store to us.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.425
- I can't pay back
the loan Mr. Vargas.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.844
I don't have that kind of
money just lying around.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.763
- We are prepared to
make you an offer.

12:43.847 --> 12:47.767
If you cooperate and sign
the store over to us,

12:47.851 --> 12:50.604
we are prepared to
offer you this check.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.064
That way you can get
a little bit of money

12:53.148 --> 12:54.691
that you can walk away with

12:54.774 --> 12:58.153
and we can avoid a
nasty legal mess.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.988
- Mr. Vargas, thank you.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.616
But I believe the store
is doing just fine.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.204
- Mr. Thomas, I hear
you closed the store

13:07.287 --> 13:09.206
on the busiest day of the week.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.166
And you even give things away.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.210
This is not good business.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.545
- Look, I'm just trying
to be a good manager.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.172
- A good manager?

13:17.255 --> 13:19.174
- Yes a good manager.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.343
It's called being
a good steward.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.011
- Steward?

13:23.094 --> 13:25.180
Like Martha Steward?

13:25.263 --> 13:26.723
Like the Steward of Gondor?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.558
- No.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.937
The biblical guidelines on
how to best manage your life.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.147
Especially the most
important things.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.191
- That's all very nice,

13:36.274 --> 13:38.652
but I'm not convinced that
you are a good manager.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.404
And the store needs to
be run like a business.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.657
I urge you to take this offer

13:43.740 --> 13:45.492
before I walk out that door.

13:47.244 --> 13:50.580
- Mr. Vargas, I cannot
accept your offer,

13:50.664 --> 13:52.749
but I'll tell you what.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.417
It's a long weekend coming up,

13:54.501 --> 13:57.462
maybe if you can stay til
Monday, three o'clock.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.839
Look at how I run my store.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.050
And if you're not convinced,

14:02.133 --> 14:04.469
I will sign over
the store to you

14:04.553 --> 14:06.304
without a fight.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.474
However, if I can
change your mind,

14:09.558 --> 14:11.977
then I want you to go
back to your investors

14:12.060 --> 14:14.479
and let them know there's
nothing to worry about here.

14:14.563 --> 14:15.397
What do you think?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.233
- Are you insane?

14:18.316 --> 14:20.318
I'm not staying
here all weekend.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.445
Forget it, we'll
see you in court.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.908
- He wanted us to stay
here for four days?

14:26.992 --> 14:28.326
Is he crazy?

14:28.410 --> 14:29.911
- That's what I told him.

14:29.995 --> 14:33.248
- Besides, I didn't bring
enough clothes for four days.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.958
- Four days without internet?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.794
Come on dad, you're
killing my social life.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.087
I'm not gonna have any friends

14:39.170 --> 14:40.255
by the time I get back.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.674
- Yeah dad, this
place is boring.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.217
- I don't need your opinion.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.635
Besides, if you were smart,

14:45.719 --> 14:48.054
you'd be worried about
acing your history report.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.349
(quirky music)

14:51.433 --> 14:54.352
- Hun, maybe it's just worth
staying here for a few days.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.272
- I thought you,

14:57.355 --> 14:58.898
I thought you
didn't like it here?

14:58.982 --> 15:01.901
- Maybe if we can
stay here until Monday

15:01.985 --> 15:04.738
we can close the deal
and get your bonus.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.450
Plus, you can spend
some time helping Josh

15:08.533 --> 15:09.868
in his history project.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.046
- A hardware store?

15:21.129 --> 15:22.547
Really dad?

15:22.631 --> 15:24.132
Could there be a
more boring place?

15:24.215 --> 15:26.301
- Come on Josh, maybe
there's wifi here.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.136
- I don't care about wifi.

15:28.219 --> 15:28.928
(Jessy gasps)

15:29.012 --> 15:30.555
- How could you?

15:30.639 --> 15:32.098
- Alright guys, I have to
go up and see Mr. Thomas.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.141
Stay out of trouble.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.519
- That's my specialty.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.730
- No.
(Jessy chuckles)

15:38.813 --> 15:41.316
- I'm glad you changed
your mind Mr. Vargas.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.109
- Please, just call me Tony.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.736
And the only thing
that I've agreed to

15:44.819 --> 15:46.488
is to stay here til Monday.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.323
Nothing in my mind has changed

15:48.406 --> 15:50.116
about what I see going on here.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.493
- Fair enough.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.620
I only ask for one other thing.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.789
You see, I really
want you to understand

15:55.872 --> 15:58.375
what I mean about
being a good steward.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.960
It's not just something
that we do at a store.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.588
It's a way of living your life.

16:03.672 --> 16:06.174
You see, I've chosen
to manage the details

16:06.257 --> 16:08.593
of my life God's way.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.721
While most people choose
to do that their own way

16:11.805 --> 16:14.391
or the way society
says they should.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.102
- So, what are you saying?

16:17.185 --> 16:19.521
- So I want you to
compare the common way of

16:19.604 --> 16:22.691
managing your life and
God's way of managing it.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.734
And then Monday at three p.m.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.362
You can decide for yourself
how I run this store.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.573
- Okay, fine.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.117
I'll go along with this.

16:33.243 --> 16:36.830
- Just to make sure you
fully understand some things,

16:36.913 --> 16:39.499
I might ask you to do
some special tasks.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.253
Don't worry, it's
nothing wild or illegal.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.547
And if you do, I'll
sign the papers

16:45.630 --> 16:48.633
over to the investment
company quick and painless.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.844
- What exactly do
you have in mind?

17:01.813 --> 17:04.482
- Hey, what are you doing?

17:04.566 --> 17:07.026
- What am I doing or what
am I supposed to be doing?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.904
- I guess they're
not the same thing.

17:10.989 --> 17:14.032
- I'm supposed to be working
on my history project.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.617
- Ooh, sorry.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.704
We finished school last week.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.289
- Lucky.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.250
- So what are those?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.461
- I'm making my own pair
of night vision goggles

17:24.544 --> 17:27.922
using this modified
virtual reality headset.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.301
- Well that's a mouth full.

17:32.177 --> 17:35.805
Well, I'm Cam and this is Faith.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.640
My mom works here in the store.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.602
- And my Uncle James
owns the store.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.938
- I'm Josh, I'm stuck
here for a few days

17:44.022 --> 17:46.107
because my dad has some
meetings or something.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.318
And that's my brother Jessy.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.780
- [Faith] What's he doing?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.699
- He's just trying to
save his social life

17:54.783 --> 17:56.534
from being flushed
down the toilet.

18:00.663 --> 18:05.126
- So Josh, that's going to
be an aphotic optical device?

18:06.503 --> 18:08.129
Night vision goggles.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.130
- Yeah.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.757
- What is that?

18:10.840 --> 18:14.511
- It means you can supposedly
see in the dark with those.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.597
- Not supposedly, it
will see in the dark.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.641
- You want to test it
in the store basement?

18:19.724 --> 18:21.267
It's dark down there.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.312
- It's very dark down there.

18:24.395 --> 18:25.772
- You think we could?

18:25.855 --> 18:27.023
- Indubitably!

18:27.106 --> 18:28.149
Come on.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.109
- Did you hear me?

18:30.193 --> 18:32.320
I said it's very
dark down there.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.828
(slow paced music)

18:43.122 --> 18:46.501
Did I mention it's a
little scary down there?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.378
- I believe you may
have mentioned it.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.724
- I don't like coming down here.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.143
But Cam's not scared.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.355
- Wow.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.024
This building is old.

19:11.109 --> 19:15.613
- Yeah, Mr. Thomas said the
original part was built in 1912.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.159
Are you ready for delumination?

19:21.953 --> 19:23.496
- Delumination?

19:23.580 --> 19:25.373
- To turn off the lights.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.542
- Oh yeah, just wait a second.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.712
Does he always talk like that?

19:30.795 --> 19:32.463
- That's affirmative.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.675
- Okay, turn off the lights.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.594
- I don't like the dark, Cam.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.429
- Come on Faith, try
not to be scared.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.935
Well Josh, are they operational?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.145
- [Josh] Yeah!

19:47.228 --> 19:48.021
Cool!

19:49.022 --> 19:50.189
- Can I look?

19:50.273 --> 19:52.317
Maybe I'll be less scared.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.651
- [Josh] Sure.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.034
- [Faith] Cool!

20:01.117 --> 20:02.035
These are neat!

20:03.828 --> 20:04.621
- Can I see?

20:06.331 --> 20:08.958
- You don't need them Cam,
you're not afraid of the dark.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.002
- I just wanna
see how they work.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.587
- They work just fine.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.173
- Come on Faith.

20:15.256 --> 20:18.092
- Oh, okay.

20:18.176 --> 20:18.927
Here.

20:24.015 --> 20:27.018
- [Cam] Whoa, these
are pretty cool!

20:41.157 --> 20:43.076
- How does he get
anything done around here?

20:43.159 --> 20:45.870
He's been with that
guy for 15 minutes!

20:47.664 --> 20:51.501
And, there's a dog walking
around in the store, nice.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.045
- Those are cool.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.005
What are you gonna do with them?

20:56.089 --> 20:58.299
- I don't know, spying.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.760
- There is not much of a
populace for espionage.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.056
There's not much to spy here.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.015
- Don't remind me.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.269
Hey what's that over there?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.480
- [Cam] Oh, that's the part
of the basement that...

21:14.023 --> 21:14.774
- Dark.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.275
We don't go there.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.277
- I was gonna say tenebrous.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.780
But yeah, the light
over there doesn't work.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.282
- Lets check it out with these!

21:23.908 --> 21:25.952
- You want to go back there?

21:26.035 --> 21:27.286
- Yeah, come on!

21:29.872 --> 21:32.458
(ominous music)

21:41.801 --> 21:45.263
Hey, did you know there's
hole in the wall here?

21:45.346 --> 21:46.305
- [Cam] A hole?

21:46.389 --> 21:47.473
Really?

21:47.557 --> 21:49.142
We never saw that before.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.937
I wish this place
had lights back here.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.689
- [Josh] I have a
flashlight if you want.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.482
- Why didn't you say so!

21:56.566 --> 21:57.567
- [Josh] You never asked!

21:59.360 --> 22:01.362
- Cool flashlight.

22:01.446 --> 22:02.113
That's pretty,

22:03.114 --> 22:04.115
effulgent.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.160
Hold on guys,

22:07.243 --> 22:09.912
I'm gonna be blind for a
couple of seconds here.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.330
You go on without me.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.086
- Come on, let's go in.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.172
- You know, I think
my mom is calling me.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.381
- Come on Faith!

22:24.844 --> 22:27.972
- Wow, this place
is way too cool.

22:28.056 --> 22:30.016
- [Cam] I never knew
this place existed.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.394
- I wish I never knew
this place existed.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.190
- Hold on, let me see this.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.115
What is this?

22:46.199 --> 22:47.867
- [Faith] Maybe it's
a secret treasure map!

22:47.950 --> 22:49.077
- Don't be silly Faith.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.578
It's just an old piece of paper.

22:54.248 --> 22:59.045
Look, it's addressed
to a place in Arizona.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.798
- Maybe it's a spy document.

23:03.132 --> 23:06.094
- Maybe it's a secret
letter from the President!

23:06.177 --> 23:07.845
- Maybe it's a "do
not enter" sign

23:07.929 --> 23:09.680
that somebody forgot to put up.

23:09.764 --> 23:10.973
- What does it say?

23:12.183 --> 23:16.020
- "Dear sir, thank
you for your help.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.439
"Per our agreement,
you must now..."

23:21.984 --> 23:24.403
"You must now
destroy all documents

23:24.487 --> 23:26.280
"that refer to 'the door'

23:26.364 --> 23:29.492
"in order to keep
the location secret."

23:30.868 --> 23:32.286
- A secret door?

23:32.370 --> 23:33.955
- [Faith] In Arizona?

23:34.997 --> 23:38.167
- Look, it's dated 1958.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.253
Whoa!

23:41.212 --> 23:42.630
- Cool!

23:42.713 --> 23:45.633
- That thing is ancient.

23:45.716 --> 23:47.301
- Maybe it's an
important document.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.595
Maybe we should return
it to the original owner?

23:49.679 --> 23:51.180
- Are you serious?

23:51.264 --> 23:53.266
It looks like trash,

23:53.349 --> 23:55.434
but I wonder what it means?

23:55.518 --> 23:57.603
A secret door?

23:57.687 --> 23:59.230
- Maybe we should give
it back to the person

23:59.313 --> 24:00.481
who put it there.

24:00.565 --> 24:03.234
- Dude, you guys are crazy.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.778
That's been sitting
for about 50 years.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.238
No one's missing it.

24:07.321 --> 24:09.699
Besides, helping someone
you don't even know,

24:09.782 --> 24:11.117
that's just whack.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.661
- Well, my dad says
you should help others

24:13.744 --> 24:15.246
before you help yourself.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.748
- Helping someone that you
don't even know exists?

24:17.832 --> 24:20.001
That just doesn't make sense.

24:20.084 --> 24:23.504
But then again, it
is a mysterious note.

24:23.588 --> 24:26.090
And since I'm bored
out of my mind,

24:26.174 --> 24:27.341
I guess I'll help you.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.260
- Cool.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.304
Well your spy stuff already
helped us find this paper.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.597
- I have an idea.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.098
Let's show this
to my Uncle James,

24:34.182 --> 24:35.641
maybe he'll know
something about it.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.482
- Hey guys, who's your friend?

24:43.566 --> 24:45.067
- This is one of my boys.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.070
Josh this is Mr. Thomas,
he's the owner of the store.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.697
- Hi.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.407
- Uncle James, we found
this paper in the basement.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.535
- Yeah, it's
superannuated from 1958.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.662
It mentions a man
named Jack Hawkins.

24:56.746 --> 24:57.830
You know anything about him?

24:57.914 --> 24:59.624
- Superannuated?

24:59.707 --> 25:00.458
- Yeah.

25:01.876 --> 25:04.629
If I'm not mistaken,
Jack Hawkins used to own

25:04.712 --> 25:06.422
this store a long time ago.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.008
But that's a neat piece
of store history though.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.509
- Do you think it's important?

25:10.593 --> 25:12.428
- Yeah, do you think we
should return it to him?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.889
- Oh no, I wouldn't
worry about that,

25:14.972 --> 25:17.683
although it is a bit of
a historical mystery!

25:17.767 --> 25:19.352
- Okay, thanks.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.525
- James, I was
watching you earlier.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.986
I believe in customer
service but you're spending

25:29.070 --> 25:30.905
way too much time
with your customers.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.241
You spent like 20 minutes
with this one guy.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.033
(Thomas chuckling)

25:34.116 --> 25:34.909
- Maybe.

25:34.992 --> 25:35.826
He had some big questions.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.495
He's working on a project.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.956
But Tony, I think
you forget something.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.626
Remember, this store is not
just about making money,

25:43.709 --> 25:46.837
it's about serving my community
and connecting with them.

25:46.921 --> 25:49.090
- Well, your investors
believe the purpose of this

25:49.173 --> 25:51.384
store to make money.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.136
I do well in my business
because I focus on making money,

25:54.220 --> 25:55.680
like a business should.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.807
- I'm sure you're
a good businessman,

25:57.890 --> 25:59.433
and you're right, I
probably don't spend

25:59.517 --> 26:01.852
enough time focusing
on making money.

26:01.936 --> 26:04.313
- Which is why I'm stuck here.

26:04.397 --> 26:07.024
- Which reminds me, as
part of our agreement,

26:07.108 --> 26:09.151
I mentioned to you
that while you're here

26:09.235 --> 26:11.404
I might ask you
to do a few tasks.

26:11.487 --> 26:12.947
- That's true, I agreed to that.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.031
What are you gonna make me do?

26:14.115 --> 26:15.157
Are you going to make
me sweep the floor?

26:15.241 --> 26:16.033
(Thomas chuckling)

26:16.117 --> 26:17.326
- Nothing of the sort.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.705
I want you to make a list.

26:20.788 --> 26:23.040
- A list of what?

26:23.124 --> 26:25.167
- A list of things
you're thankful for.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.752
I gotta run now
for a few minutes,

26:26.836 --> 26:27.670
but you can work on that.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.130
- Are you serious?

26:30.298 --> 26:31.966
This is ridiculous.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.895
- I wish this note
had more information.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.732
- Maybe it does, maybe
it's written in code!

26:47.815 --> 26:50.234
- Or with invisible ink!

26:50.318 --> 26:51.360
(light music)

26:51.444 --> 26:52.194
- [Faith] What?

26:52.278 --> 26:53.654
What did I say?

26:53.738 --> 26:55.948
- They used a lot of
invisible ink in the 1950's.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.200
Maybe there's invisible
ink on this note.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.952
- Okay, take it easy.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.787
I like this spy playing a lot,

27:01.871 --> 27:04.248
but I think you're taking this
a little bit too seriously.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.875
- What if there is something?

27:05.958 --> 27:06.876
How could we read it?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.005
- With this.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.508
This is an ultraviolet light.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.597
- Do you always walk around
with all this paraphernalia?

27:19.680 --> 27:20.473
- Mm hm.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.352
Nothing.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.269
- Good try.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.438
It would've been really cool.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.439
- Can I see that?

27:35.404 --> 27:37.198
Uh, guys, what's this?

27:42.495 --> 27:45.289
(whimsical music)

27:48.834 --> 27:51.420
(slow paced music)

28:16.320 --> 28:19.156
- Alrighty, here
you go, one list.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.826
- Oh, that's not for
me, that's for you.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.035
- What do you mean it's for me?

28:23.119 --> 28:24.245
What are you talking about?

28:24.328 --> 28:25.704
- Actually, it's
for your family.

28:25.788 --> 28:27.456
You see, the second
part of this task

28:27.540 --> 28:29.291
is for you to share that list

28:29.375 --> 28:31.794
with your family
over supper tonight.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.337
- You're kidding, right?

28:33.421 --> 28:35.673
- No, not at all.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.178
- They're going to think
I've gone off the deep end.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.517
Supper at six

28:46.600 --> 28:48.310
at home.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.939
No I'm not kidding.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.776
They're gonna
think I've flipped.

29:00.114 --> 29:01.532
- I got one bar!

29:01.615 --> 29:04.160
I got a message from Dad?

29:07.621 --> 29:09.373
- Alright, I sent the message.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.749
I just hope they get my text

29:10.833 --> 29:12.668
because there's not
much signal around here.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.545
- Where you guys staying?

29:14.628 --> 29:17.006
- It's a rental over
on Garrenridge Road.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.925
- Oh yeah, not much
signal in some parts.

29:21.218 --> 29:24.221
(slow loving music)

29:31.395 --> 29:33.481
- Well, look at us
sitting around the table.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.274
This is interesting!

29:35.357 --> 29:36.484
- This is weird.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.360
What's going on dad?

29:38.444 --> 29:41.989
- Well, there's something
I need to tell you guys.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.200
- Please tell me the
man accepted your offer

29:44.283 --> 29:45.951
and we are going home tomorrow.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.786
- No, no, no, nothing like that.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.413
- You're getting me a car?

29:49.497 --> 29:52.374
- You're sending Jessy to
boarding school in Alaska?

29:52.458 --> 29:53.709
- No guys.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.378
I kind of agreed to
do a couple of things

29:56.462 --> 29:58.380
while I'm here observing.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.175
And this is Mr. Thomas's
idea by the way.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.885
- Dad, you're
getting really weird.

30:04.220 --> 30:09.016
- Well, today I wrote a list
of things I'm thankful for

30:09.099 --> 30:12.353
and I need to share
them with you.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.231
- This should be interesting.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.690
- We should do
supper more often,

30:16.774 --> 30:18.692
this is better watching TV!

30:19.735 --> 30:23.656
- Well, I probably don't
say this very much guys,

30:23.739 --> 30:26.659
but the one thing that
I'm most thankful for

30:28.619 --> 30:29.995
is you guys.

30:32.581 --> 30:36.043
- Mom, I think dad has
malaria or something.

- Oh not a problem.

31:11.495 --> 31:13.706
You guys are guests
in this town.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.250
I just wanted to stop by
and see if needed anything.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.212
- Listen, thanks for
suggesting that task today.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.172
You know, the list.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.632
- How'd it go?

31:23.716 --> 31:26.343
- Actually, we had a
nice time together.

31:26.427 --> 31:29.138
It was a kinda awkward, mostly
for me.

31:30.097 --> 31:32.558
But I still don't know
what you're getting at.

31:34.310 --> 31:38.397
- Well Tony, I also stopped
by to tell you something else.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.107
The store is closed tomorrow,

31:40.190 --> 31:43.068
so you don't have to go hang
out there tomorrow morning.

31:43.152 --> 31:45.821
- Right, you close
on the busiest day.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.658
- Yes, well, we'll be at
church tomorrow morning,

31:49.742 --> 31:52.244
of course you are welcome
to join is if you like.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.038
And, I also wanted to invite you

31:54.121 --> 31:58.375
and your family at three
tomorrow for a little outing.

31:58.459 --> 32:01.003
- So is this one of
your required tasks?

32:01.086 --> 32:03.172
- No, but I'd really
like it if you

32:03.255 --> 32:05.174
and your family came.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.009
I think you'd have fun.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.387
Just meet me at the store at
three if you decide to come.

32:11.055 --> 32:13.140
Well, have a good night Tony.

32:14.058 --> 32:16.685
(light music)

32:19.938 --> 32:21.357
- This is crazy.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.319
- Dad, did you
really mean all that

32:25.402 --> 32:27.363
stuff you said at supper?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.990
- Of course I did Josh.

32:30.074 --> 32:34.787
Listen, I probably don't
say this enough, or ever,

32:35.746 --> 32:38.165
but you guys really
do mean a lot to me.

32:38.248 --> 32:40.417
And you know what,
I'm gonna get better

32:40.501 --> 32:41.794
at showing that okay.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.421
Hey you know what?

32:44.505 --> 32:46.632
Mr. Thomas invited us
to go with him tomorrow

32:46.715 --> 32:49.426
at three p.m. to go
do something with him.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.261
I'm not sure what
he has in mind,

32:51.345 --> 32:53.097
but it sounds kind
of mysterious.

32:53.180 --> 32:53.847
Do you wanna go?

32:53.931 --> 32:55.599
- Yeah!

32:55.683 --> 32:57.518
Is Mr. Thomas still making
you do weird things?

32:57.601 --> 32:58.477
(Tony chuckling)

32:58.560 --> 33:00.521
- I don't know, we'll see.

33:00.604 --> 33:01.814
Why don't you get
some sleep now okay?

33:01.897 --> 33:02.606
- Okay.

33:02.690 --> 33:03.857
Dad?

33:03.941 --> 33:05.234
- Yeah.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.527
- Do you think you'd have
some time this weekend

33:06.610 --> 33:08.362
to help me on my
history project?

33:08.445 --> 33:10.823
- That sounds like a great idea.

33:10.906 --> 33:13.367
What part of history do you
need to do your report about?

33:13.450 --> 33:15.327
- Anything in the 1900's.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.705
I was thinking about doing
something about spies.

33:17.788 --> 33:19.456
- That sounds pretty cool.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.834
Why don't we plan on working
on that together this weekend.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.001
- Awesome, thanks Dad.

33:25.796 --> 33:26.839
- Josh,

33:28.882 --> 33:31.427
I think I don't spend
enough time with you.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.179
And if it's okay, I
think it'd be great

33:34.263 --> 33:36.390
if we could maybe do
more stuff together.

on your mind this morning?

33:54.825 --> 33:57.578
- Well, I had a talk
with Josh last night

33:57.661 --> 34:01.039
and, I don't know,
I'm just wondering

34:01.123 --> 34:02.750
if I'm being a good Dad.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.043
I mean, I'm at

34:05.127 --> 34:07.379

getting in trouble.

34:07.463 --> 34:10.299

I mean, that's also
part of my job.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.719
- What did you tell him?

34:14.803 --> 34:16.554
- Well, I told him
he gets in trouble

34:16.638 --> 34:18.181
because he doesn't use his time

34:18.264 --> 34:20.641
and his energy to
do good things,

34:20.726 --> 34:23.020
and then it hit
me, what about me?

34:23.103 --> 34:25.898
Do I use my time and
energy to guide the boys?

34:25.981 --> 34:27.940

You have to turn on the wifi?

38:20.966 --> 38:22.467
- Yeah, it's byzantine.

38:23.719 --> 38:26.888
(slow banjo music)

38:28.932 --> 38:33.061
- You should get be getting
a wifi signal right about

38:33.145 --> 38:33.937
now.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.941
- Oh, oh I have wifi!

38:39.234 --> 38:40.277
Yes!

38:41.695 --> 38:43.280
- Nice.

38:43.363 --> 38:46.116
I say we start with the company
at the top of the letter.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.538
(slow paced music)

38:51.621 --> 38:54.332
- I bet this Hawkins man
is going to be very happy

38:54.416 --> 38:57.127
to get his letter back
about the secret door.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.005
- Hmm, dead end guys.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.798
It looks like the
company on the letter

39:01.882 --> 39:05.052
went out of business since 1979.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.553
- 1979?

39:06.636 --> 39:08.680
That's prehistoric!

39:08.764 --> 39:11.141
- Now what?

39:11.224 --> 39:13.101
- Well, it looks like
the man in this letter,

39:13.185 --> 39:16.688
Mr. Hawkins, died in 1989.

39:16.772 --> 39:18.398
But check this out.

39:18.482 --> 39:21.568
He was living in this
town when he died.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.153
- Not in Arizona?

39:25.113 --> 39:25.906
Hm?

39:27.365 --> 39:29.117
- [Faith] Uh oh.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.786
- What?

39:30.869 --> 39:33.705
- That's the look he gets when
he thinks he has a great idea

39:33.789 --> 39:36.249
but it's usually not.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.710
- Guys, the cemetery's
just down the street,

39:38.794 --> 39:40.212
maybe we can find his grave.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.046
- His grave?

39:41.129 --> 39:41.963
Really?

39:42.047 --> 39:43.465
Isn't that kind of creepy?

39:43.548 --> 39:45.008
- What are you, timorous?

39:45.092 --> 39:45.801
- Me?

39:45.884 --> 39:46.927
No.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.220
- What's timorous?

39:48.303 --> 39:50.138
- He's used that
one on me before.

39:50.222 --> 39:51.765
He's saying you're chicken.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.184
I'll admit it, I'm chicken.

39:54.267 --> 39:55.894
- No you're not Faith.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.813
Come on guys, spies
need to follow clues

39:57.896 --> 39:59.731
no matter where they lead.

39:59.815 --> 40:00.774
- Yeah, he's right.

40:00.857 --> 40:01.608
Come on Faith.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.695
- How do I get dragged
into these things?

40:05.779 --> 40:07.531
I'm timorous, remember?

40:09.032 --> 40:11.868
(ominous music)

40:19.668 --> 40:22.003
- Well, I guess we're here.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.465
- Are you sure we
have to go in there?

40:26.424 --> 40:28.635
- If we wanna find more
clues about Mr. Hawkins,

40:28.718 --> 40:30.595
we have to go in there.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.283
(twig cracking)

40:51.366 --> 40:52.617
- Seriously?

40:52.701 --> 40:54.661
I thought you guys
weren't scared.

40:54.744 --> 40:58.206
- Well just do us a favor
and watch where you're going.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.958
(twig cracking)

41:00.041 --> 41:01.793
- That wasn't me.

41:01.877 --> 41:03.211
- It wasn't me either.

41:04.421 --> 41:05.922
(kids screaming)

41:06.006 --> 41:07.632
- Hey kids, can I help
you with something?

41:07.716 --> 41:10.969
- I just need my heart
to get started again.

41:11.052 --> 41:12.179
- It's just you Mr. Becker.

41:12.262 --> 41:13.889
We didn't see you.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.765
- Sorry kids I startled you.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.267
Been doing a little
bit of raking.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.227
Can I help you find something?

41:19.311 --> 41:22.480
- We are looking for the
grave of Jack Hawkins.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.941
- Jack Hawkins.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.651
Let me think, where is he?

41:27.319 --> 41:28.570
I believe he's right over there.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.197
Go that direction.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.073
- Wow, you're pretty good.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.033
- Yeah.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.451
- Well, thanks Mr. Becker.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.494
- Certainly, have a great day.

41:36.578 --> 41:37.329
- You too.

41:47.797 --> 41:50.634
- Maybe we should
split up and search.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.135
- Great idea.

41:52.219 --> 41:54.137
Me and Cam are
gonna go over there.

41:55.472 --> 41:58.225
- I thought we
were gonna split...

42:15.575 --> 42:17.494
- I don't think
this is a good idea.

42:17.577 --> 42:21.081
- Yeah, I've been in
more delightful places.

42:21.164 --> 42:23.500
(perky music)

42:27.170 --> 42:28.964
- Hey guys!

42:29.047 --> 42:30.090
I found it!

42:32.717 --> 42:35.178
(gentle music)

42:35.262 --> 42:36.012
- Already?

42:37.764 --> 42:39.891
Yeah, there it is.

42:39.975 --> 42:43.520
Died on August two, 1989.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.357
- Guys, look what
it says back here.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.945
- "Dad, I'll see you on
resurrection morning.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.571
"Bill."

42:53.655 --> 42:55.240
- You guys know what that means?

42:55.323 --> 42:56.366
- That he was a Christian?

42:56.449 --> 42:57.951
- No.

42:58.034 --> 43:00.704
I mean yes, but look,
he has a son, Bill.

43:00.787 --> 43:02.414
Maybe he still lives in town.

43:02.497 --> 43:03.331
Come on, let's go!

43:03.415 --> 43:04.416
- Yeah, let's go!

43:05.375 --> 43:07.544
- Why do we have
to run everywhere?

43:07.627 --> 43:09.838
(bird cawing)

43:12.382 --> 43:13.341
Guys!

43:13.425 --> 43:14.217
Wait up!

43:19.597 --> 43:20.348
Uncle James!

43:20.432 --> 43:21.599
Uncle James!

43:21.683 --> 43:23.601
Do you know a guy
named Bill Hawkins?

43:23.685 --> 43:25.228
- Bill Hawkins?

43:25.312 --> 43:28.565
Hmm, I don't think I know
anybody by that name.

43:28.648 --> 43:30.608
I'm assuming he's
related to that guy

43:30.692 --> 43:32.485
in your mystery letter?

43:33.194 --> 43:36.573
- Excuse me Mr. Thomas,
Mrs. Heinz wants to know

43:36.656 --> 43:39.159
when the kangaroo
closure's gonna arrive.

43:39.242 --> 43:40.118
- Oh Mrs. Heinz?

43:40.201 --> 43:41.578
I need to speak with her.

43:41.661 --> 43:42.620
I'll be right back guys.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.418
Hey there Mrs. Heinz.

43:48.501 --> 43:49.961
- [Heinz] Hi.

43:50.045 --> 43:51.421
- Good news, your enclosure
arrived this morning.

43:51.504 --> 43:52.464
Sorry for the delay.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.341
- Awe, no worries mate.

43:54.424 --> 43:56.051
But I tell you what,
it's hard to keep

43:56.134 --> 43:59.012
those little Joeys from
jumping all over the furniture.

43:59.095 --> 44:00.138
- Look, I'll go get it for you.

44:00.221 --> 44:00.972
- Thanks heaps.

44:02.557 --> 44:04.434
- Kangaroo enclosure?

44:07.187 --> 44:09.939
- Well so much for
that Bill Hawkins clue.

44:10.023 --> 44:11.941
- Yeah, we hit a dead end.

44:12.025 --> 44:13.068
- Hold on!

44:13.902 --> 44:16.488
We can look up his
name in the phone book!

44:16.571 --> 44:19.074
- Whoa, put that away.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.034
There's technology for that.

44:21.117 --> 44:22.952
Phone book, what's next?

44:23.912 --> 44:26.247
- What's wrong
with a phone book?

44:28.625 --> 44:31.002
- Okay, there is
one person in town

44:31.086 --> 44:33.004
with the last name Hawkins.

44:33.088 --> 44:34.297
But his name is William.

44:37.926 --> 44:39.052
- Wait a second!

44:39.135 --> 44:40.762
The gravestone said Bill,

44:40.845 --> 44:42.597
and Bill is short for William!

44:42.680 --> 44:44.224
- That's right!

44:44.307 --> 44:47.060
There isn't a phone number,
but there's an address!

44:47.143 --> 44:48.269
- [Josh And Cam] Let's go!

44:49.479 --> 44:51.773
- Why do we have
to run everywhere?

44:52.899 --> 44:55.735
(triumphant music)

45:05.912 --> 45:07.539
I'm tired?

45:07.622 --> 45:10.458
- Hey, this is the neighborhood
I was at yesterday.

45:10.542 --> 45:13.002
Helping a lady bring flowers.

45:13.086 --> 45:14.129
- Really?

45:14.212 --> 45:16.131
You came to help someone?

45:16.214 --> 45:19.050
I thought you said helping
a total stranger was whack?

45:19.134 --> 45:21.511
- Yeah, I know.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.805
- I'm glad you're helping
us figure out this mystery.

45:23.888 --> 45:24.848
- Let's go.

45:24.931 --> 45:27.517
(light music)

45:31.312 --> 45:32.730
I guess this is it.

45:38.820 --> 45:41.614
(heavy breathing)

45:43.992 --> 45:46.453
(Cam knocking)

45:50.999 --> 45:52.709
I guess there's nobody home.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.752
- Maybe we should leave a note?

45:54.836 --> 45:56.171
- I have a notebook and a pen.

46:15.190 --> 46:18.359
- What do you not have in there?

46:18.443 --> 46:20.403
- Spies need to be
prepared for anything.

46:27.327 --> 46:29.537
- Okay guys, this is what I got.

46:29.621 --> 46:32.957
"Hello Mr. Hawkins, we
are Faith, Josh, and Cam.

46:33.041 --> 46:34.834
"We found an old
letter in the basement

46:34.918 --> 46:36.169
"of the hardware store.

46:36.252 --> 46:38.379
"I think it has your
dads name on it.

46:38.463 --> 46:40.215
"It talks about a secret door.

46:40.298 --> 46:41.758
"We think it's in Arizona.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.801
"We wanted to just
return it to you.

46:43.885 --> 46:45.678
"We'll come back later."

46:45.762 --> 46:47.305
What do you guys think?

46:47.388 --> 46:48.640
- I like it.

46:54.521 --> 46:55.980
- I can't believe we're
doing so much work

46:56.064 --> 46:57.065
to help somebody.

47:03.863 --> 47:04.656
- Yoo hoo!

47:05.448 --> 47:06.241
Yoo hoo!

47:12.163 --> 47:13.873
- [Cam] Yes?

47:13.957 --> 47:16.459
- Didn't you come here
yesterday to bring my flowers?

47:16.543 --> 47:18.044
- Yeah, that was me.

47:18.127 --> 47:19.462
- I thought so.

47:19.546 --> 47:21.297
You have no idea
how much pleasure

47:21.381 --> 47:23.508
those flowers have given me.

47:23.591 --> 47:25.552
- Is there anything
else I could do for you?

47:26.970 --> 47:29.973
- Yes, my son in Oregon
gave me this the other day.

47:30.056 --> 47:32.976
And he said we can see
each other when we call,

47:33.059 --> 47:36.187
but I have no idea
how to use this.

47:45.446 --> 47:47.782
- Can you make it
work for her Josh?

47:47.865 --> 47:49.117
- [Josh] I think I can do it.

47:52.287 --> 47:54.872
- I'll be right back okay?

47:55.498 --> 47:58.626
(slow paced music)

48:04.173 --> 48:05.300
Here you go kids.

48:05.383 --> 48:06.676
- Alright!
- Awesome!

48:06.759 --> 48:08.136
- [Faith] Wow, thank you!

48:09.846 --> 48:12.098
- Excuse me ma'am,
do you know the man

48:12.181 --> 48:14.309
that lives across
the street there?

48:14.392 --> 48:16.853
- Oh yes, I have known
him since he was a boy.

48:16.936 --> 48:18.313
Billy Hawkins.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.565
Well, he's not a
little boy anymore,

48:20.648 --> 48:23.026
but he travels a
lot for work now.

48:23.109 --> 48:25.653
And when he's gone he
lives his dog Jack with me.

48:28.531 --> 48:29.866
- Hey, I think I got it!

48:33.953 --> 48:34.996
- Ma?

48:35.830 --> 48:37.206
- Hello Justin!

48:37.290 --> 48:38.833
- I can see you!

48:38.916 --> 48:40.668
Kids, come see grandma!

48:40.752 --> 48:41.461
- [Child] Grandma!

48:41.544 --> 48:42.462
Ooh it's grandma!

48:42.545 --> 48:43.296
- Hi!

48:47.675 --> 48:49.761
- Josh, why did
you help that lady?

48:49.844 --> 48:52.138
- I knew you were
gonna ask that.

48:52.221 --> 48:53.723
I don't know.

48:53.806 --> 48:55.224
- Wow, you really made
her day when you fixed it

48:55.308 --> 48:56.476
so she can see her family.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.227
Did you see the
look on her face?

48:58.311 --> 48:59.687
- Plus we got cookies!

49:05.026 --> 49:08.905
- So, do you give stuff
away all the time?

49:08.988 --> 49:09.947
- No of course not.

49:10.907 --> 49:12.408
But I do when I
think it's needed

49:12.492 --> 49:14.619
or if I think it's
the right thing to do.

49:15.662 --> 49:17.955
- I mean, yesterday
was nice with the lady,

49:18.039 --> 49:20.500
but I don't know.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.460
I work hard for the
stuff that I have.

49:22.543 --> 49:24.420
It's mine, I just
don't see why I

49:24.504 --> 49:26.172
need to be giving it away.

49:26.255 --> 49:29.384
Besides, being generous seems
to be getting you in trouble.

49:38.768 --> 49:39.936
- Excuse me.

49:40.019 --> 49:42.313
Sir, are you a
new employee here?

49:42.397 --> 49:43.940
- No, no, no.

49:44.023 --> 49:45.608
I'm just here helping Mr.
Thomas for a couple of days.

49:45.692 --> 49:48.695
But, is it okay if I
ask you a question?

49:48.778 --> 49:50.488
- Sure, what?

49:50.571 --> 49:51.823
- Why do you shop here?

49:51.906 --> 49:55.118
I mean there's one of
those big giant discount

49:55.201 --> 49:57.578
superstore lumberyards
up just a few miles away

49:57.662 --> 49:59.414
with more variety
and cheaper prices.

49:59.497 --> 50:00.790
Why do you come here?

50:00.873 --> 50:02.583
- I just like coming
to this store.

50:02.667 --> 50:04.377
- Mom, that's not
why you come here.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.586
You should tell him mom.

50:05.670 --> 50:07.338
- Tell me what?

50:07.422 --> 50:08.172
- It's not a big deal.

50:08.256 --> 50:08.965
- Yes it is.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.425
It's a miracle.

50:10.508 --> 50:12.427
Last year my mom lost her job.

50:12.510 --> 50:14.512
These things happen, but
things got pretty bad

50:14.595 --> 50:16.931
and a man even came and
took her phone away.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.975
That was not cool.

50:19.058 --> 50:20.893
And then something
else happened.

50:20.977 --> 50:23.521
Like the worst thing you
could possibly imagine.

50:23.604 --> 50:24.939
The plumbing in
the basement broke.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.150
There was water
gushing out everywhere.

50:27.233 --> 50:29.193
We cleaned up the water
and a plumber came,

50:29.277 --> 50:32.447
but he told us it would
cost like $400 to fix.

50:32.530 --> 50:35.491
We came here to see how much
the materials would cost

50:35.575 --> 50:37.285
and it was 200 bucks.

50:37.368 --> 50:38.911
Which we still didn't have.

50:38.995 --> 50:41.622
The next you know, Mr.
Thomas tells my mom

50:41.706 --> 50:44.250
he wants to give us
the plumbing materials.

50:44.333 --> 50:45.501
Can you believe that?

50:45.585 --> 50:47.879
Who gives people
plumbing materials?

50:47.962 --> 50:50.465
Plus, he closed his
shop for like two hours

50:50.548 --> 50:52.759
just to come and help
us fix the problem.

50:52.842 --> 50:54.802
Isn't that crazy?

50:54.886 --> 50:57.388
- Crazy's not a nice
thing to say sweetie.

50:57.472 --> 51:00.975
But Mr. Thomas is a
kind and generous man.

51:01.058 --> 51:03.603
I try to do as much
shopping as I can here

51:03.686 --> 51:06.105
because I like the
way he runs his store.

51:06.189 --> 51:09.484
Plus, I told all my friends
to come and shop here.

51:09.567 --> 51:10.777
Do you know how
rare it is to find

51:10.860 --> 51:12.487
a store like this nowadays?

51:17.366 --> 51:21.078
- Well, who knows when Mr.
Hawkins is coming back.

51:21.162 --> 51:23.873
I wish we knew more about
the secret door in Arizona.

51:23.956 --> 51:25.458
- Yeah.

51:25.541 --> 51:27.251
- Plus, I'm gonna
be leaving tomorrow.

51:27.335 --> 51:28.419
I don't think
we're gonna be able

51:28.503 --> 51:30.213
to solve the
mystery by tomorrow.

51:30.296 --> 51:32.256
- I wish the letter said
more about the secret door.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.300
- That's the whole point silly.

51:34.383 --> 51:36.219
It's a secret door.

51:36.302 --> 51:39.305
Don't worry Josh, we had
fun with you being spies.

51:39.388 --> 51:40.598
Can you show me what
other cool stuff

51:40.681 --> 51:41.682
you have in your backpack?

51:41.766 --> 51:43.768
- You like my spy gear?

51:44.727 --> 51:47.939
This is my ultraviolet
light, you already saw that.

51:49.148 --> 51:52.568
This is my GPS, it
connects with a satellite,

51:52.652 --> 51:54.946
and gives directions,
type in your address

51:55.029 --> 51:57.698
or the coordinates.

52:00.368 --> 52:01.577
- What?

52:01.661 --> 52:02.620
What is it?

52:02.703 --> 52:03.371
- Hmm?

52:04.539 --> 52:05.832
Let me see the letter.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.126
Look at these
numbers on the back.

52:09.210 --> 52:10.253
What if...

52:10.336 --> 52:11.712
- What if what?

52:11.796 --> 52:13.631
- What if these numbers
are coordinates?

52:13.714 --> 52:15.049
Read the numbers off to me.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.843
- Okay, here's the first set.

52:16.926 --> 52:19.053
42.009300.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.346
- Slowly.

52:21.305 --> 52:23.641
- Four, got it?

52:23.724 --> 52:25.142
Two, got it?

52:25.226 --> 52:26.477
- Faster.

52:27.895 --> 52:29.355
- 42.009300.

52:33.192 --> 52:33.818
Is that good?

52:33.901 --> 52:34.861
- Yes, thank you.

52:34.944 --> 52:37.488
- Okay, 86.158

52:41.576 --> 52:43.661
154.

52:43.744 --> 52:45.037
- Is it in Arizona?

52:45.913 --> 52:48.416
- No, these aren't coordinates.

52:48.499 --> 52:50.960
If they are, the door's
in the middle of China.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.004
At least we tried.

52:58.384 --> 53:00.595
- Well Mr. Green,
looks like you've got

53:00.678 --> 53:02.096
quite a project going on here.

53:02.179 --> 53:04.390
- Yeah, just repainting
the kitchen at home.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.601
You know, I really don't
know much about painting.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.144
But I hope I got
enough stuff here.

53:08.227 --> 53:10.730
- Well, if you manage
your portions right,

53:10.813 --> 53:12.648
I think you have
enough for your kitchen

53:12.732 --> 53:14.358
and your neighbors
kitchen as well.

53:14.442 --> 53:16.944
(men laughing)

53:20.239 --> 53:21.157
Happy painting!

53:21.240 --> 53:22.408
- [Green] Thanks!

53:22.491 --> 53:23.868
- So now you're
encouraging others

53:23.951 --> 53:25.661
to give their stuff away too?

53:25.745 --> 53:29.415
- Well, there's nothing
wrong with being generous.

53:29.498 --> 53:30.791
- Sure, I guess.

53:31.959 --> 53:34.128
I guess I'm just not
understanding this stuff yet.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.838
I mean, didn't you
also tell me that

53:35.922 --> 53:38.633
you give a portion
of your income away?

53:38.716 --> 53:42.053
- Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it giving it away.

53:42.136 --> 53:43.846
It's called tithing.

53:43.930 --> 53:46.098
You see, God has
given me so much

53:46.182 --> 53:48.976
that we return a portion of that

53:49.060 --> 53:51.145
to pay for all the good things
that the church is doing

53:51.228 --> 53:52.605
all around the world.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.523
And even here in our community.

53:56.859 --> 53:57.944
Is that everything sir?

53:58.027 --> 53:58.945
- [Customer] Yup,
that'll be all.

53:59.028 --> 53:59.820
- Very good.

54:05.660 --> 54:07.578
That'll be $7.22.

54:09.038 --> 54:10.081
Thank you.

54:11.248 --> 54:12.249
- Can I get one?

54:12.333 --> 54:13.709
- No, it's mine!

54:15.002 --> 54:16.253
- [James] Here you are sir.

54:16.337 --> 54:17.046
- [Customer] Thank you.

54:17.129 --> 54:17.838
- Have a great day.

54:17.922 --> 54:18.923
- You too.

54:19.006 --> 54:20.341
- Thank you for
shopping with us.

54:21.634 --> 54:24.470
- Kids, they're so
selfish nowadays.

54:25.429 --> 54:26.514
- And why is that?

54:27.598 --> 54:29.183
Let me ask you a question.

54:29.266 --> 54:32.186
Who provided that boy with
a bag of chips that he had?

54:32.269 --> 54:34.188
- Well, the father did.

54:34.313 --> 54:36.148
- And you saw how the
boy didn't even want

54:36.232 --> 54:39.360
to give one chip to the
one who provided it to him?

54:40.111 --> 54:42.238
Do you think that's right?

54:42.321 --> 54:43.698
Do you think the father's happy

54:43.781 --> 54:45.366
about how his son
wouldn't even give

54:45.449 --> 54:47.576
him not one potato chip?

54:47.660 --> 54:48.995
Or should he get angry

54:49.078 --> 54:50.913
and never give his
son chips again

54:50.997 --> 54:52.748
for being so selfish?

54:52.832 --> 54:54.041
- Well of course not.

54:54.125 --> 54:55.543
I'm sure as he grows
he'll teach him

54:55.626 --> 54:57.003
that he shouldn't be selfish

54:57.086 --> 54:58.212
and that he should
be generous with

54:58.295 --> 54:59.296
the things that he's been...

55:01.090 --> 55:03.467
(light music)

55:07.847 --> 55:08.723
- Hey Josh?

55:08.806 --> 55:09.473
- [Josh] Yeah.

55:09.557 --> 55:10.558
- See this dash?

55:11.892 --> 55:13.894
Well I thought it was a dash,

55:13.978 --> 55:15.771
but do you think it
could be a negative?

55:18.107 --> 55:19.734
- Wait a minute.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.193
If that number's a negative,

55:21.277 --> 55:22.528
it'll be pointing at
the complete opposite

55:22.611 --> 55:23.446
side of the world.

55:26.574 --> 55:27.867
No way!

55:27.950 --> 55:29.493
You're not gonna believe this!

55:29.577 --> 55:31.537
By adding the negative,

55:31.620 --> 55:33.622
the place is only
five miles away

55:33.706 --> 55:35.332
from where we are right now.

55:35.416 --> 55:36.500
- Are you sure?

55:36.584 --> 55:37.877
What do we do?

55:37.960 --> 55:38.919
- Should we go to
these coordinates

55:39.003 --> 55:40.671
and see what's there?

55:40.755 --> 55:42.465
- It looks like the location
of these coordinates

55:42.548 --> 55:44.091
is in the middle of the woods.

55:44.175 --> 55:46.010
Near the state road.

55:46.093 --> 55:47.678
- Well five miles
is not too far.

55:47.762 --> 55:49.472
- Five miles is very far.

55:49.555 --> 55:51.307
I'm not gonna run five miles.

55:51.390 --> 55:53.517
- Maybe we can
organize an expedition!

55:53.601 --> 55:54.894
What do you guys think?

55:54.977 --> 55:56.520
- I vote yes.

55:56.604 --> 55:58.022
- I vote affirmative.

55:59.732 --> 56:01.484
- Why do I get the
feeling we're going

56:01.567 --> 56:03.194
no matter what I say?

56:04.111 --> 56:06.322
Fine, I'll go.

56:07.323 --> 56:09.825
But I don't think this
is a good idea though.

56:10.743 --> 56:12.745
- Well, it's probably
too late today,

56:12.828 --> 56:15.164
so let's go first
thing tomorrow morning.

56:15.247 --> 56:15.998
Come on.

56:17.166 --> 56:18.918
- Remember, I'm leaving
tomorrow afternoon,

56:19.001 --> 56:20.711
so we have to go early.

56:20.795 --> 56:22.379
- Well, Faith and
I both have bikes

56:22.463 --> 56:23.756
and I can borrow my dads.

56:23.839 --> 56:25.925
- Amen I don't have to run.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.176
- Okay, let's do this!

56:27.259 --> 56:29.053
- Okay, let's meet at
the store when it opens.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.222
- Okay, I'm gonna
get so grounded.

56:43.192 --> 56:45.194
- Hey Tony, I hope
you haven't forgotten

56:45.277 --> 56:47.279
about our little assignments.

56:47.363 --> 56:49.031
I know tomorrow's your last day,

56:49.115 --> 56:52.284
but I have one last task
for you, a simple one.

56:52.368 --> 56:55.287
- Alright, these assignments
haven't been too bad.

56:55.371 --> 56:58.415
- Have you ever heard of a
man named John D. Rockefeller?

56:58.499 --> 57:01.585
- Of course, wasn't he like
the first billionaire ever?

57:01.669 --> 57:03.212
- Correct.

57:03.295 --> 57:06.340
Now, from the age of
53 when he retired,

57:06.423 --> 57:08.592
John D. Rockefeller
was sick mentally,

57:08.676 --> 57:11.011
emotionally, physically,

57:11.095 --> 57:13.139
and he was just
totally miserable.

57:13.222 --> 57:16.725
But then something
completely changed his life.

57:16.809 --> 57:18.352
And that's your assignment.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.980
See if you can tell me
what changed his life

57:21.063 --> 57:23.816
and brought him joy for
another 40 plus years

57:23.899 --> 57:25.317
way up into his 90's.

57:26.235 --> 57:29.071
(slow paced music)

57:46.964 --> 57:49.466
- So, what was your task today?

57:50.467 --> 57:52.761
- Well, it was an
interesting one.

57:52.845 --> 57:54.847
When Rockefeller was 53--

57:54.930 --> 57:57.266
- Rockefeller, the rich guy?

57:57.349 --> 57:59.101
- Yes, that one.

57:59.185 --> 58:02.771
When he retired, he
was miserable and
in really bad shape.

58:02.855 --> 58:05.107
But something changed.

58:05.191 --> 58:07.067
And for the last 40
years of his life,

58:07.151 --> 58:08.444
they were wonderful.

58:08.527 --> 58:09.195
- Really?

58:09.278 --> 58:10.738
What changed?

58:10.821 --> 58:12.573
- It turns out that for the
second half of his life,

58:12.656 --> 58:15.201
he spent all of his time
and effort giving away

58:15.284 --> 58:18.704
billions of dollars
to like missionaries,

58:18.787 --> 58:21.040
and education, and science.

58:21.123 --> 58:22.499
It was amazing.

58:22.583 --> 58:24.043
- Wow.

58:24.126 --> 58:26.629
- I just don't know what
to do about this store.

58:26.712 --> 58:29.965
I mean, Mr. Thomas
is a really nice guy.

58:30.049 --> 58:31.467
I see what he's doing here.

58:31.550 --> 58:33.928
I see how he's
trying to be helpful

58:34.011 --> 58:36.722
and an important part
of this community,

58:36.805 --> 58:39.350
but his business
practices are just so

58:40.226 --> 58:42.561
unconventional.

58:42.645 --> 58:45.522
Of course there's no way the
investors are gonna go for it.

58:45.606 --> 58:48.192
And I really wanted that bonus.

58:48.275 --> 58:49.068
Now,

58:50.569 --> 58:54.573
I just need to figure out how
to break it to him softly.

58:54.657 --> 58:57.368
- Well, I guess you have until
tomorrow to figure it out,

58:57.451 --> 59:01.205
but maybe you can take him
out for lunch or something?

Can we go to the store now?

01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:27.124
- Yes, yes, let's go.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.462
Hey, I thought you said the
hardware store was boring?

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.257
- Hey guys, sorry I'm late.

01:00:35.341 --> 01:00:37.593
- It's okay, we just
got here a minute ago.

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:40.137
Did anyone disclose to
anyone where we're going?

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.347
- Not me.

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.473
- Me neither.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:43.307
- It's not that big of a deal.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:44.558
It's only five miles.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.268
We'll be back before lunch.

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:47.686
- What do you think Faith?

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:49.271
- Why are you asking me?

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:51.523
Can you think of a better
way to get grounded?

01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:53.442
- You won't get grounded.

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:56.195
- You'll be surprised how
often she gets grounded.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.029
- Really?

01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:57.821
- Let's just go.

01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:04.912
Is he still trying
to save his...

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:09.875
- [Kids] Social life.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:10.959
- Yeah.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.837
- So, what are you gonna do?

01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:15.297
- I'm actually gonna help him.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:21.387
- Awe, that's so cute!

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.056
- You can't call
my spy stuff cute.

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:25.849
You may call it cool.

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:27.601
By the way, can you
hold your hand out?

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:32.981
(machine buzzing)

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:35.484
(upbeat music)

01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:48.580
(machine beeping)

01:01:50.499 --> 01:01:52.292
- That was so cool!

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.545
- Hey Jessy!

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.173
The nearest cell tower
is in that direction!

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:00.509
- Thanks!

01:02:05.973 --> 01:02:06.682
- Come on, let's go.

01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:14.648
(upbeat music)

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:59.443
(ominous music)

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:03.113
I guess we're gonna
have to go on foot now.

01:03:03.197 --> 01:03:05.073
- Are you sure?

01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:06.116
- Yup.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:06.909
Well, let's get to it.

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:42.444
- You guys ever
been here before?

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:45.197
This place is kinda
cool and spooky.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.950
- Dude, I've never
been here before.

01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:50.953
- Dude, I wish I've
never been here before.

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:52.955
This is the stuff of nightmares.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:54.206
- Seriously?

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.624
It's just some woods.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.233
Oh.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.196
- [Cam] You think
it's safe to traverse?

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.992
- It looks like it hasn't
been used in a long time.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.910
- So who's going first?

01:04:31.994 --> 01:04:34.413
- Clearly that's your job.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:35.455
- Why me?

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.374
- 'Cause you're holding the GPS

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:40.419
and no, I don't wanna hold it.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:41.295
- Fine.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.963
It's just a little bridge.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.423
- Little and decrepit.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.184
- Come on guys,
it's not that bad.

01:04:56.268 --> 01:04:56.893
(wood cracking)

01:04:56.977 --> 01:04:57.978
Whoa!

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:01.148
- Is he alive?

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:04.901
- I'm okay guys, it's safe!

01:05:04.985 --> 01:05:05.902
Just step on the edges.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.086
- Hey, you think
we're trespassing?

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.713
- I don't think so.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:27.674
According to the GPS, I
think we're on state land.

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:30.927
- Nice touch with
the "I think" Josh.

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:32.220
- Stop worrying.

01:05:32.304 --> 01:05:33.930
Anyways, I think
we're almost there.

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:34.765
Come on.

01:05:58.372 --> 01:05:59.539
We're getting close guys.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.541
According to this, we're
about 25 feet away.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:02.751
Start looking around.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:04.628
- [Faith] Look!

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:07.631
- I think I'm hallucinating.

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:09.883
- I see it but I
don't believe it.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:12.969
- Why is there a door in
the middle of the woods?

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:17.391
- Hey Tony, thanks again
for inviting me to lunch.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.725
- Hey, happy to do it.

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:21.269
We've got some important
things to talk about.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:22.521
- I suppose we do.

01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:29.361
(door ringing)

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:31.321
- Hello, table for two please?

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.408
- Just give me one minute.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:35.909
I need to clear one off for you.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.160
- Thank you.

01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:38.286
- [Cashier] You're welcome.

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.122
(door ringing)

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:41.415
- That's true.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:42.958
Let's see if we can
grab a quick bite to eat

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.793
and get back to work.

01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:47.045
- They need all the
help they can get.

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:49.673
- Gentlemen, I got your table
cleared off right over here.

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:52.592
- Young lady, I think these
gentlemen are in a hurry.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:54.136
So why don't you
give them our table.

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:55.137
- Oh okay.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.263
Alright guys, if you
wanna come this way

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.222
I have a seat for you.

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:00.600
- Thank you so much.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.310
We really appreciate this.

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:04.271
- That was really nice of him.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.898
- Boy it really was, man.

01:07:06.982 --> 01:07:09.526
- Sorry, I hope that's okay.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.069
Another table will free up soon.

01:07:14.406 --> 01:07:16.199
- Finally, see what I.

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:18.285
See what I mean?

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.619
You give up our table

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.580
and it gives us
nothing in return.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:23.790
If you ask me, this is
poor time management.

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:25.292
Your decision to
give up our table

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.252
just wasted five
minutes of our time.

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:30.255
James, you ask me to come here

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.424
and stay til Monday
at three o'clock.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:36.011
Here we are, but things
aren't looking good.

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:38.430
- Thank you.

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:39.973
- You're welcome.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.224
- Thanks so much.

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:44.102
(slow paced music)

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.280
- I can't believe this
door is actually here.

01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.324
(ominous music)

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.743
- [Faith] This place looks
like it's falling apart.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:01.912
- [Josh] What should we do?

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:08.001
(loud banging)

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.252
- What?

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:10.420
- Don't do that!

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:12.047
You scared us half to death!

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.924
- You expecting
someone to answer?

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:17.426
- [Cam] Look, there's
a lock on the door.

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:19.095
- [Faith] What do you
think is behind this door?

01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:20.596
- I don't know.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.307
(zipper zipping)

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:23.683
What are you looking for?

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:26.560
- This.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.524
It's a surveillance
device for spies.

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:33.443
- That's cool.

01:08:33.527 --> 01:08:35.194
Can I live in your backpack?

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:38.156
(Josh chuckling)

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:42.285
(slow paced music)

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.038
- What do you see?

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.874
- [Josh] I don't
really see anything.

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:51.002
It looks like a
little concrete room.

01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:52.504
Empty and crumbly.

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:56.131
- Man, I wish this lock was

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:57.884
(lock clanking)

01:08:57.968 --> 01:08:58.718
open.

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:06.142
(door creaking)

01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:11.606
- Guys--

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:12.524
- Yeah yeah, we know Faith.

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:14.568
Maybe we shouldn't go in.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.529
- How did you know what
I was going to say?

01:09:28.415 --> 01:09:30.166
I'm not going in first.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.252
You have the light,
you go in first.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.379
- She does have a point.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.613
(suspenseful music)

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.241
(Josh and Faith screaming)

01:10:03.325 --> 01:10:05.869
- I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:07.954
- That was dreadfully awesome.

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:16.796
It's just what you
saw with your camera.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.090
Just a small concrete room.

01:10:20.842 --> 01:10:22.802
Maybe we should go.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.596
(wood cracking)

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:27.349
(kids screaming)

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:31.686
(kids coughing)

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.021
Is everyone okay?

01:10:35.023 --> 01:10:36.399
- I'm good.

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:37.776
- I'm scared.

01:10:37.859 --> 01:10:39.235
- I'm with you Faith.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:40.862
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:47.494
- [Josh] Come on guys, push!

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.080
(kids grunting)

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:58.922
- We're stuck.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:01.633
Wait, Josh, couldn't
you call someone?

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.473
- There's no signal.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:09.808
- What are we gonna do?

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:14.396
(kids screaming)

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.277
- No one can hear us.

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.488
- And no one even
knows we're here.

01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:30.912
- So here's the bottom line,

01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:33.123
as I told you, the
investors are concerned

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:35.125
about how you manage the store.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.460
And since they only
care about numbers,

01:11:37.544 --> 01:11:40.296
my report is going to
have to reflect this.

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.674
They will take the store
away from you James.

01:11:43.717 --> 01:11:46.886
I'm really sorry, I just
don't see any other way.

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:48.972
- I understand.

01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:51.349
An agreement is an agreement.

01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:55.353
You held up your
end of the bargain.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:00.150
(solemn music)

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:20.503
- How long have we been here?

01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:21.755
- I don't know.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.673
- We've been here for hours.

01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:25.258
- I'm really scared.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:28.094
- Don't worry Faith,
we'll get out of here.

01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:31.890
Actually, you know what
we haven't done yet?

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:33.349
We haven't prayed.

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:34.934
- Praying?

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.478
Do you think praying
will really help us?

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:37.437
- Yeah!

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.897
- How do you pray?

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.690
- I'll pray.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:43.485
Dear Jesus, we're in
a lot of trouble here.

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:45.612
We were trying to help this man

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.655
and now we're stuck
in this place.

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:49.783
Can you help us get out?

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:50.742
Please?

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:51.910
Amen.

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:53.578
- Amen.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:56.122
- So what happens next?

01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:59.209
- Well, I guess we trust God

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.877
and be patient.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.504
- Has God ever
helped you before?

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:04.297
- Sure, lots of times.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.090
- Really?

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:09.427
- [Cam] Hey guys!

01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:10.220
You gotta check this out!

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:11.054
Come on!

01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:14.182
I think there's a door
behind all this junk!

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.394
- I wonder what's
behind the door.

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:20.980
- I don't know if
we should go in.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:22.899
We already got in
trouble from the first

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:25.026
door we went into.

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:27.779
- Yeah, but what
if it's a way out?

01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:29.239
- We have to look in there.

01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:34.035
- [Faith] Be careful.

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:44.212
- What is this place?

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:48.174
- [Faith] I don't
know, I don't like it.

01:13:48.258 --> 01:13:50.260
It's, it's,

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.511
- [Faith And Cam] Scary.

01:13:52.137 --> 01:13:53.138
- Yeah, we know.

01:13:56.516 --> 01:13:58.893
- [Cam] This place looks like
a secret hideout or something.

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:04.190
Look, these used to be beds.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:10.864
- I wonder what this
hand crank thing is?

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.953
It's a dead end.

01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:19.497
- [Faith] What are we gonna do?

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:23.001
- Do you think God
will really help us?

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:33.636
- I have to admit, I
was a bit surprised

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.014
by your management style.

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:39.142
But, you do close
on the busiest day

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.895
and sometimes you close
in the middle of the day.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:43.188
And you do give things away,

01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:44.772
and you even have
animals walking

01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:46.107
around in your store.

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:49.736
Unfortunately, the
investors will disagree

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:51.487
with this management style

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:53.364
and they will take
away the store.

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:56.242
Unless something happens
in the next minute.

01:14:57.285 --> 01:14:58.912
At least I'm paying for lunch.

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:03.082
Miss, could I get
the check please?

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.167
- Oh I forgot to tell you,

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.920
those four gentlemen who
you guys let sit down,

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.296
they actually paid
your bill for you?

01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:09.464
- What?

01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:10.673
- Yeah, they were
impressed by your

01:15:10.757 --> 01:15:12.300
kindness and generosity.

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:15.303
And they even left me a
big tip too, so thank you!

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:17.722
(perky music)

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:23.186
(phone buzzing)

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:23.978
- It's my wife.

01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:26.522
Hello.

01:15:26.606 --> 01:15:27.899
Hello.

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:30.026
This signal here is bad news.

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:30.818
(ominous music)

01:15:30.902 --> 01:15:31.653
What?

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:33.404
What's that?

01:15:33.488 --> 01:15:35.198
What do you mean you
haven't seen them all day?

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:38.868
Okay, I'm coming to
the store right now.

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:40.536
Josh and the other
two kids are missing.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.371
- Missing?

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:43.706
- I haven't seen them for hours!

01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:45.208
- Honey what's going on?

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:46.918
- Tony, I haven't seen
Josh the whole day.

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.670
And no one else has seen him.

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:49.754
Have you seen him?

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:51.005
- No I haven't.

01:15:51.089 --> 01:15:52.173
- He didn't come
for lunch either.

01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:53.800
Jessy said he saw them.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.718
- The three of them
rode off on bikes.

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.095
- On bikes?

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:58.888
Josh doesn't have a bike here.

01:15:58.972 --> 01:16:01.182
Besides, he knew we
were leaving at three.

01:16:01.266 --> 01:16:02.517
- Mrs. Vargas, I'm
gonna close this store

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.477
so we can all fan out
and search for them.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.603
- Thank you!

01:16:05.687 --> 01:16:06.688
- Let's go this way guys.

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:20.368
- It's getting pretty late.

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:22.578
Our parents are probably
disquieted by now.

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:25.999
- Do you always talk like that?

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.167
- My mom gives me a new
vocab word every day,

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:30.295
she says it will
help me one day.

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:31.796
I'm still waiting.

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.300
- Do you think we'll
ever get out of here?

01:16:35.383 --> 01:16:36.134
- I don't know.

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:40.388
If you do, what would
you do different?

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:42.140
- What do you mean?

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:43.641
- I don't know, like if
you had a second chance

01:16:43.725 --> 01:16:46.185
to do something different,
how would you do it?

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:48.813
- Well I would probably
stop following you guys

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.440
to all these crazy places.

01:16:53.026 --> 01:16:54.569
- I don't know.

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:57.447
I would probably help Mr.
Thomas more around the store.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.699
I know your dad is here
because he's in trouble.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:00.867
Maybe I could help him?

01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:03.036
How 'bout you?

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:05.621
- I don't know.

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:08.416
Ever since we've tried to
return this mysterious note,

01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:10.835
things have been a
little different.

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:12.712
I like using my spy
stuff to do good things,

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:15.798
but usually all it does
is get me in trouble.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:18.259
- I think there's definitely

01:17:18.343 --> 01:17:21.054
a right and wrong
way of doing things.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.430
- Well, I'm glad
you guys are here

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.724
to help me not be afraid.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:27.810
I heard there were bears
and bobcats in these woods.

01:17:27.894 --> 01:17:28.811
- Bears and bobcats?

01:17:28.895 --> 01:17:30.855
Aren't those dangerous?

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:32.398
(footsteps approaching)

01:17:32.482 --> 01:17:33.274
- What was that?

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.986
(rock clanking)

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:39.572
- There's something
digging at the door.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.824
- Let's go hide at the back.

01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:48.414
- It's coming in!

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:51.084
(kids screaming)

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.044
- Josh?

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.296
Josh?

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:58.633
Where is he?

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.051
Josh?

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.469
Anything?

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:02.720
- Nothing.

01:18:02.804 --> 01:18:04.847
I don't know where
those kids could be.

01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:06.557
- But what should we do?

01:18:06.641 --> 01:18:09.018
- Well Mr. Thomas already
has the police department

01:18:09.102 --> 01:18:11.104
and the fire department looking.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.522
All we can really do is wait

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:15.358
and trust that they
know where to look.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.068
- Waiting and
trusting is so hard.

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.278
I wish we could do something.

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:22.073
(solemn music)

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:26.744
- What if, what if we pray?

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:41.175
- [Cam] Are we dead?

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:43.553
- [Josh] Not yet.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:45.346
- [Faith] I am.

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:50.184
It's a dog.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:52.937
- Everybody okay in here?

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:56.107
- [Faith And Cam] Yes.

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:58.568
- You scared us half to death.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:18:59.944
- Who are you?

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:01.320
- I'm Billy Hawkins.

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:03.614
This is my dog,
Stewardship Jack.

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:08.703
I take it you're
Faith, Cam, and Josh?

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:09.745
- [Kids] Yeah.

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:14.000
- Hawkins to Fire Chief over.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:17.253
- [Chief] This is
Fire Chief, over.

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:20.381
- Jeff, this is Billy, I found
the kids and they're alright.

01:19:20.465 --> 01:19:23.009
I'll bring them back
to meet their parents.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.385
- That's great news Billy!

01:19:24.469 --> 01:19:26.179
That's music to my ears.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:27.847
I'll let the parents know.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.348
- Alright, over and out.

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:33.352
- That's a pretty cool watch
you got there Mr. Hawkins.

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:34.562
- Yes it is.

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:36.397
Come on, let's
get you guys home.

01:19:42.612 --> 01:19:45.156
- [Faith] How did you
know we were here?

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.366
- [Billy] Well I just got
home from a trip today.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.368
When I went to get Jack,
Mrs. Henderson said

01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:51.370
there were some
kids looking for me.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.831
And then I heard
some kids were lost

01:19:53.915 --> 01:19:56.459
and the Fire Chief asked
me to help look for them.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.503
Plus, I saw your
note at the house.

01:19:59.587 --> 01:20:01.881
- [Josh] But how did
you know we were here?

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:03.758
- When I was a kid I used
to come to this place.

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:05.176
I loved it here.

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:06.719
Then I saw the note.

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:09.388
Then I realized you
probably discovered a clue

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:11.641
about the location.

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:14.185
But anyway, I thought God
wanted me to come here.

01:20:15.186 --> 01:20:16.229
- That's God.

01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:20.191
- We were trying to return
a mysterious note to you.

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:21.817
It looked important.

01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:24.278
- Yeah, we found it in the
basement of the hardware store

01:20:24.362 --> 01:20:25.780
using Josh's spy stuff.

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:27.448
- Spy stuff?

01:20:27.532 --> 01:20:29.158
- See, it looks like
your dad wrote down

01:20:29.242 --> 01:20:31.577
the coordinates of this
place in invisible ink

01:20:31.661 --> 01:20:33.037
and we found it.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.664
- Wow, I'm impressed.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:37.083
You are guys are
great detectives.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:38.793
- And we're spies too.

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:41.796
- I used to play spy stuff too.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:44.173
That was a big deal
when I was a kid.

01:20:44.257 --> 01:20:44.966
- Really?

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:45.883
- Sure.

01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:47.218
- Why did your dad
even build that

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:48.636
place in the first place?

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:50.638
- That's called a
fallout shelter.

01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:52.223
Or a bomb shelter.

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:54.642
- [Faith] What's a bomb shelter?

01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:56.644
- When I was a kid,
times were different.

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:59.230
I lived during what they
called The Cold War.

01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:00.273
- [Cam] The Cold War?

01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:02.233
- I've heard of that.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:03.568
What is that?

01:21:03.651 --> 01:21:06.862
- It was a time
of fear, distrust,

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:09.782
threats, and spies.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.325
- Spies?

01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:13.411
- My dad built that
place to protect us.

01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:15.496
He stockpiled it with food,

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.665
there were beds, there's
even a hand crank

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:20.126
that you can use to
circulate the air.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.253
- Yeah, I saw the broken
hand crank in there.

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:23.921
- The nations of the world were

01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:26.090
threatening each other
with nuclear bombs,

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.758
so they sent spies
to the other country

01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:29.510
to see what they were doing.

01:21:29.594 --> 01:21:31.304
So people started building
these bomb shelters

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:32.805
in case of an attack.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.432
- [Faith] What happened next?

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:36.475
- [Billy] Well sadly, the
leaders of the United States

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:39.061
and Russia, they became enemies.

01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:43.024
- It got to the point
that both countries

01:21:43.107 --> 01:21:44.859
were threatening
to launch horrible

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.527
nuclear missiles
toward each other.

01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:48.946
People were scared,
so many people built

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:51.657
underground bomb shelters
to protect their families.

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:54.535
They had beds, food, and water.

01:21:54.619 --> 01:21:57.663
Last week I got to visit
an actual bomb shelter

01:21:57.747 --> 01:22:00.583
that had been hidden
away for decades.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:03.502
All I know is that it
would be really hard

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:06.505
to have to stay in there
for a very long time.

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:10.343
By 1962, the relationship
between the US

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:13.512
and the Soviet Union
became super intense

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:16.057
during a period called
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.477
US spy planes discovered
Soviet missiles in Cuba.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.187
Both countries
had their missiles

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:22.730
pointed at each other.

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:25.983
Things became very
tense and people thought

01:22:26.067 --> 01:22:29.445
within hours there would be
a nuclear missile launched.

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:32.114
Fortunately, some
spies got involved

01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:34.158
and helped diffuse a super

01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:36.994
tense moment between
the countries.

01:22:37.078 --> 01:22:41.165
Most historians say the
Cold War ended around 1991.

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:43.209
And the reason
they called it Cold

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:45.169
was because there
was a lot of tension.

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:48.673
But no actual large scale
fighting ever happened.

01:22:48.756 --> 01:22:51.467
I'm glad I don't have
the huge responsibility

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:54.345
of managing an
army or a country.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:56.639
But I learned
recently that we do

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.600
have other important
things we oversee.

01:22:59.684 --> 01:23:01.727
It could be our
health, our families,

01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:05.356
our resources, our
environments, even our talents.

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:07.817
I had an experience
recently that made me see

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.195
that everyone, including
me, you, world leaders,

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:13.739
parents, kids, we
should each learn

01:23:13.823 --> 01:23:16.867
to manage all these
things in a positive way

01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:20.162
so that the history that is
yet to be made in the future

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:22.373
can be one we can
all be proud of.

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:23.624
Thank you.

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:26.669
(audience applauds)

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.017
Hey Mr. Hawkins!

01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:43.644
- Josh, you did great up there.

01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:44.687
- Thanks for coming.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:46.021
- [Billy] I brought
you a little something.

01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:46.897
- Wow!

01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:48.774
Cool, thanks!

01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:52.361
This is from the bomb shelter!

01:23:52.445 --> 01:23:53.654
- Neat!

01:23:53.738 --> 01:23:55.948
You can add that to
your spy collection.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:56.866
Thanks a lot Billy.

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.242
I mean not just for the sign,

01:23:58.325 --> 01:24:00.578
but also for getting
them out of trouble.

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:03.414
- Hey, I didn't
know you guys came.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:04.582
- Yup, Uncle James brought us.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.500
We came just in time.

01:24:06.584 --> 01:24:09.336
- Josh, your presentation
was meritorious.

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.464
- I had a meeting with
your dad earlier today

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:13.632
and he told me all
about your presentation

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.426
and I came to surprise you.

01:24:15.509 --> 01:24:17.678
- Well, thanks for coming.

01:24:17.762 --> 01:24:19.722
My dad's been different
since he's met you.

01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:21.182
- Well I'm definitely
learning that

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:22.641
there's a right and a wrong way

01:24:22.725 --> 01:24:24.977
of managing the
important things in life.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.562
What was the word
you used James?

01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:28.981
- Steward, being a good steward.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.524
- Right.

01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:31.901
And the way that he
stewards all the important

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:34.862
things in life, it makes sense.

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:36.697
- And, since Tony
told the investors

01:24:36.781 --> 01:24:38.824
that there's nothing to worry
about down at the store,

01:24:38.908 --> 01:24:41.202
he's gonna be coming back
every once in a while

01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:44.622
to give us some business
tips that just might help.

01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:47.082
- It's gonna be splendiferous.

01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:50.127
(everyone laughing)

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.506
- Josh.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.468
Your presentation was well done.

01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:58.427
I'm glad to see you're putting

01:24:58.511 --> 01:25:00.805
your talents to good use.

01:25:00.888 --> 01:25:01.680
- Thank you sir.

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:03.766
- No more spy pranks right?

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:06.268
- Spy pranks are history.

01:25:06.352 --> 01:25:08.103
Starting tomorrow
I'm a new Josh.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.192
- Tomorrow?

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:15.486
(timer beeping)

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:16.320
Josh!
