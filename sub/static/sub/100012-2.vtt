19:59.640 --> 20:02.086
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:36.600 --> 20:37.726
Hello, Mum.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.930
This is Gina.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.530
Gina Gray.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.083
The captain married us on board.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.730
She's my wife, Mum. At least look at her.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.561
Tommy said to ask you
to tell me the truth.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.246
We've been travelling for 15 days,
Mrs Gray.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.771
Maybe we could talk about this
at another time.

21:01.880 --> 21:02.802
Yes.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.206
Let's go home and we can talk.

21:04.320 --> 21:08.689
You have no home
until you tell me the truth.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.245
Here?

21:10.360 --> 21:12.283
Yeah.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.285
ARTHUR: Michael!

21:19.080 --> 21:20.445
Hello, love.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.004
Welcome to Birmingham, eh?

21:26.360 --> 21:28.169
Michael?

21:29.640 --> 21:30.846
OK.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.208
Our ship docked at Belfast.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.924
I was then taken off the ship by two men.

21:37.040 --> 21:37.962
At gunpoint.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.128
I'm speaking to my son.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.401
Fuck you.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.604
Fuck you too, Arthur.

21:44.720 --> 21:49.282
This is my fucking wife.
I bring her home... To this?

21:52.080 --> 21:54.367
Come on, Gina.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.171
Well, where are you going now, eh? Hmm?

22:00.280 --> 22:02.009
Introduce me at least.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.327
- Excuse me.
- Look at this.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.363
Look at this.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.403
This is it, Gina.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.683
This is my fucking people.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.962
Do you want to know the truth, Arthur?

22:14.080 --> 22:15.445
Do you want to know the truth, Mum?

22:16.640 --> 22:22.044
I did not betray my fucking family!

22:23.320 --> 22:25.402
Now, Mum...

22:26.760 --> 22:27.886
...I want to go home.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.604
POLLY: I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.447
MICHAEL:
Was that Tommy's orders, then, was it?

22:36.560 --> 22:39.723
See, the Midland Hotel
is Tommy's little kingdom.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.130
Where all the porters keep an eye,

22:44.240 --> 22:47.722
where all the telephone exchange girls
are reporting on my calls.

22:47.840 --> 22:54.121
Yeah, well, why don't you think of it
like, er, quarantine, Michael, eh?

22:54.240 --> 22:57.722
We'll treat you like a fucking dog, hmm?

22:59.400 --> 23:00.890
Smelly one.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.286
Stinking one.

23:03.280 --> 23:08.002
Until we know you're clean, hmm?

23:08.120 --> 23:10.088
Fuck you, Arthur.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.009
Stand aside, Arthur.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.690
No, Poll.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.606
Come on, baby.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.449
Forget about 'em.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.643
Go and phone Tommy, tell him.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.491
Polly says Michael's telling the truth.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.126
GINA: It's all right. Forget about 'em.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.241
All right, Poll.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.883
Nice coat.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.809
What are you like? Camel, right?

23:43.640 --> 23:44.641
Oh.

23:46.400 --> 23:50.689
Welcome to the family, Gina Gray.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.560
THOMAS: I applaud the attempt by Mr Rowley
in the Education Bill

23:57.680 --> 24:00.490
to raise the school leaving age to 15.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.364
I also support...

24:18.000 --> 24:20.526
...as regards means-testing of any kind,

24:20.640 --> 24:22.244
- we are the people...
- MEMBERS: Yeah!

24:22.360 --> 24:25.330
- ...we've had enough.
- MEMBERS: Yeah!

24:25.440 --> 24:28.444
"We are the people,
and we've had enough."

24:28.560 --> 24:30.289
I move in favour of the amendment.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.246
Mr Shelby.

24:48.920 --> 24:52.322
I must say,
you sing like a songbird in the House.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.128
And who is this pretty finch?

24:56.240 --> 24:57.162
My sister.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.327
Who's pregnant.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.601
And dangerous.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.291
- (CLEARS HIS THROAT)
- Oh, we adore dangerous.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.811
Who's <i>we?</i>

25:03.920 --> 25:06.241
It's a collective noun,

25:06.360 --> 25:10.524
in this case describing a group of people
who are impatient and young and,

25:10.640 --> 25:13.086
as I have said, adore dangerous.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.122
Mr Shelby, you had a horse of that name.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.645
Whiskey. Irish.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.161
Give him one from my bottle.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.601
And one for myself.
In fact, bring the bottle.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.727
And the lady?

25:28.840 --> 25:30.365
Isn't thirsty.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.130
How do you know about the horse?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.048
We have a mutual acquaintance.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.246
May Carleton.

25:38.360 --> 25:42.160
When I asked about you, she said,
"Oh, my goodness, where do I begin?"

25:43.560 --> 25:45.961
And why were you asking after me?

25:46.080 --> 25:48.526
Because, as I have said,

25:48.640 --> 25:50.483
I adore dangerous.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.244
And where did she begin?

25:53.360 --> 25:56.284
You know, I was rather hoping
we might have this meeting alone.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.846
My sister is my political adviser.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.328
And my advice just now was,
"Don't meet Mr Mosley."

26:02.440 --> 26:04.249
Because I am dangerous?

26:04.360 --> 26:06.249
No.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.011
What is it you are impatient for,
Mr Mosley?

26:09.120 --> 26:12.841
I'm impatient for my fucking whiskey.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.640
Bennett!

26:18.920 --> 26:20.922
May Carleton spoke about you

26:21.040 --> 26:24.806
the way I imagine one might
about a party they barely remember,

26:24.920 --> 26:27.730
where you crash the car
into the dovecote

26:27.840 --> 26:31.208
and live on champagne and cocaine
for three whole days.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.845
You know, that kind of party.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.008
Only three days?

26:36.320 --> 26:37.446
Hmm.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.643
My sister advised against meeting you

26:44.760 --> 26:49.209
because it appears
you are moving away from the party...

26:50.720 --> 26:52.802
...in a different direction.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.127
And which direction is that?

26:55.240 --> 26:57.368
Towards fascism.

26:57.480 --> 27:01.644
"We are the people,
and we have had enough."

27:03.560 --> 27:05.289
I thought that was excellent.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.928
In which direction are you heading,
Mr Shelby?

27:10.040 --> 27:12.771
I am my own revolution.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.565
And you prefer Irish to Scotch.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.720
As do I.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.731
Like all things regarding Ireland,
it is...complex.

27:22.840 --> 27:23.887
Yes?

27:31.160 --> 27:32.810
0h!

27:33.880 --> 27:36.804
Where do you stand
on the Irish question, Mr Shelby?

27:36.920 --> 27:39.651
Never been asked it.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.967
Then perhaps it's time you were.

27:42.080 --> 27:46.881
Tommy, I am the people,
and I have had enough.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.571
We are looking for someone
to begin a dialogue...

27:49.680 --> 27:51.967
...with certain elements in Belfast

27:52.080 --> 27:54.924
with whom
we don't officially have any dealings.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.487
I'll be too busy singing in the House.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.728
It would involve a promotion.

28:02.360 --> 28:05.762
Junior Minister to the Duchy of Lancaster.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.569
Birmingham is my concern.

28:08.680 --> 28:13.641
Ireland bores me.
Thanks for the whiskey, Mr Mosley.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.730
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

28:20.600 --> 28:22.409
Hmm.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.648
What the fuck was that about?

28:24.760 --> 28:27.809
Ireland. It's been Ireland's day
all fucking day long.

28:27.920 --> 28:28.842
What do you mean?

28:28.960 --> 28:32.567
Ada, go home and start calling
anyone who had dealings

28:32.680 --> 28:35.160
with Shelby Company Limited
while you were in Boston.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.441
Ask them about Michael.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.202
Ask them whatabout him?

28:40.320 --> 28:42.607
Who he's been seeing,
who he's been meeting,

28:42.720 --> 28:45.405
- what deals he's made.
- Why?

28:45.520 --> 28:50.082
Ask 'em especially about people
he's met from Glasgow or Belfast.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.568
Tommy,
why don't you come back with me, eh?

28:53.680 --> 28:55.569
You can play chess with Karl.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.523
I'll make some calls,
you can listen in.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.607
Drive home tomorrow.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.326
That bastard starts talking
about Irish whiskey.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.680
The fuck does he know? Eh?

29:02.800 --> 29:05.644
More than me, Tommy.
What are you talking about?

29:05.760 --> 29:08.923
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.247
My chair. My throne.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.930
People thinking I'm gonna fall,

29:13.040 --> 29:15.441
they start behaving
in a different way around you.

29:15.560 --> 29:16.925
Who thinks that?

29:17.040 --> 29:19.202
They start to circle.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.322
Who's going to take the throne, eh?

29:21.440 --> 29:23.761
Linda, she wants some for Arthur,

29:23.880 --> 29:26.326
Aberama Gold, people in the north,
Michael...

29:26.440 --> 29:28.602
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

29:31.040 --> 29:34.203
just go home, make some calls.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.209
Protestants are coming, I think.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.322
I need to get back to Birmingham.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.570
(SIGHS)

29:51.240 --> 29:52.844
Polly.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.450
Are you armed?

29:55.800 --> 29:57.723
Yeah.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.046
Yeah.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.481
Would you please consider
putting your weapons behind the bar

30:01.600 --> 30:04.001
in case feelings begin to run high?

30:04.120 --> 30:05.690
Behind the bar, Poll, eh?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.729
Behind my own bar, yeah?

30:15.600 --> 30:16.647
I prefer it there.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.049
Thomas?

30:29.280 --> 30:31.044
I had a dream...

30:31.160 --> 30:34.607
...about a black cat last night, Poll.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.927
A black cat dream
means there is a traitor close by.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.690
It was you who taught me that.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.201
Black cat can mean lots of things.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.766
Can mean you're hurting yourself.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.006
Betraying yourself.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.687
Are you seeing things, Thomas?

30:54.080 --> 30:55.206
Yes, I am.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.924
(CAR APPROACH ES)

30:57.040 --> 30:59.441
Yes, I am. Very clearly.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.969
Coming from every fucking direction.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.769
(CAR ENGINE STOPS)

31:07.840 --> 31:09.330
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

31:11.640 --> 31:13.210
(BAR DOOR CREAKS OPEN)

31:17.240 --> 31:18.321
Tommy.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.689
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.240
I would also like to, er, say something.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.886
- Sit down, Michael.
- I betrayed you.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.651
- Michael.
- But only in my heart.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.444
There was a time,

31:33.560 --> 31:35.005
in America,

31:35.120 --> 31:37.441
and there was a lot of money in that bank.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.688
And I wondered
if I could...I could leave,

31:39.800 --> 31:41.723
move to California.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.842
Someone said I should invest in pictures.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.246
Hollywood.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.925
But Gina stopped me.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.210
- Gina said...
- I told you to sit down, Michael.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.007
Now, tell me...

32:04.760 --> 32:06.888
...what happened on that ship

32:07.000 --> 32:08.729
in Belfast harbour.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.923
On the journey back from New York,
we got married.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.804
But we needed to find a witness.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.126
A purser.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.651
He was from Belfast.

32:19.760 --> 32:20.841
We got friendly.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.166
What happened when the ship docked?

32:24.600 --> 32:29.128
This purser had friends who ran
a whiskey distillery in County Tyrone.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.607
They wanted a way
of getting their stuff into America.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.371
So I said, "OK, invite them aboard."

32:34.480 --> 32:37.768
When they came in, I realised
that they didn't make whiskey.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.723
They were Scottish. From Glasgow.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.411
Couldn't understood
a fucking word they were saying.

32:42.520 --> 32:45.046
They started swearing,

32:45.160 --> 32:46.764
so I asked Gina to leave.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.764
That was when they started talking
about you, Tom.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.362
They said that Tommy Shelby
was a spent force,

32:54.480 --> 32:56.687
that politics had got to him...

32:58.200 --> 33:00.009
...that he was spent in the head,

33:00.120 --> 33:02.691
that now was a good time to move in

33:02.800 --> 33:04.802
and did I want to be part of it.

33:04.920 --> 33:07.491
They knew about the money we lost
in America.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.125
They said that you were going to blame me.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.607
That you had a bullet with my name on it.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.570
What did you say, Michael?

33:15.680 --> 33:17.011
I didn't have time to say anything.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.049
Coppers came on board.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.446
Well, I thought they were coppers.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.721
They, er...

33:24.200 --> 33:25.770
They were IRA.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.041
Exactly.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.804
And the first men from Glasgow?

33:37.600 --> 33:42.640
The IRA commander said the men
from Glasgow were called Billy Boys.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.051
Fucking Billy Boys.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.208
I don't know who the fuck Billy Boys are.

33:47.320 --> 33:53.043

34:11.520 --> 34:14.251
I was too busy looking forward
to giving you the good news.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.686
The reason Gina and I got married
on the ship was because Gina is pregnant.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.408

34:54.520 --> 34:56.443
Are you fucking mad, hmm?

34:58.920 --> 35:03.926
- You are free to fucking leave, Michael.
- You fucking bastard.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.247
But you're not free, Michael, are you?

35:07.960 --> 35:10.088
You lost this company a lot of money.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.531
I told you to sell...

35:13.360 --> 35:14.691
...but you held on,

35:14.800 --> 35:19.522
and now I want you to pay me back
what you owe me.

there are risks you can take.

35:36.440 --> 35:37.805

45:11.920 --> 45:14.287
you give the goalkeeper £20.

What have you got there?

45:41.560 --> 45:42.891

I poured down the lavatory.

46:14.440 --> 46:15.965
It's...it's not your fault.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.525
So...

46:24.680 --> 46:26.444
That letter's about me, is it?

46:26.560 --> 46:27.641
Yeah.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.729
- Hmm.
- And about me.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.883

two more years if he carries on like this.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.282
He's gone too far.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.970
Is that what Lizzie says, hmm?

46:50.080 --> 46:51.241
Really now?

46:51.360 --> 46:54.011
Well, how far has he gone, hmm, Linda?
How far?

46:54.120 --> 46:56.327
He's lost all the legitimate money
in America.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.681
No. No, that was Michael.

46:58.800 --> 47:01.690
He's fixing races. He's fixing football.

47:01.800 --> 47:04.724
Following the financial crisis,
the Shelby Company Limited

47:04.840 --> 47:08.049
has to find other sources of cash income.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.844
Tommy went into Chinatown.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.442
He's selling out the Communists
to the British intelligence.

47:13.560 --> 47:16.325

he gets more and more famous.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.646

47:30.080 --> 47:32.128

47:32.240 --> 47:35.847
Got it all planned out, is that right?

47:35.960 --> 47:38.042
And I tell you,

47:38.160 --> 47:42.131
all you're gonna do
is you're gonna be the good fucking wife.

47:42.240 --> 47:44.925

and deciding which one to give.

48:08.600 --> 48:10.443
Looks like I'll have to give
the other one.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.486
What other one?

48:15.480 --> 48:17.448
What fucking other one?!

48:20.520 --> 48:22.010
What did you do with my letter?

48:34.280 --> 48:35.441
I burnt it.

48:37.520 --> 48:38.681
So did Arthur.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.366
- Did you read it first?
- Yes.

48:44.560 --> 48:45.846

48:55.360 --> 48:56.964
I left school too early.

48:58.160 --> 49:00.208
Did you read the bit about the lawyers?

49:00.320 --> 49:01.481
Do you want to fuck?

49:02.920 --> 49:04.046
Didn't think so.

49:06.680 --> 49:08.330
- You don't want to eat?
- No.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.851

- Yeah.

49:25.120 --> 49:27.964

49:28.080 --> 49:29.844

she's a different kid.

50:15.800 --> 50:19.247
"Sorry about all thatmdust.

50:20.280 --> 50:22.362
"Sorry about all that mud.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.528
"And all that fucking blood."

50:26.080 --> 50:28.401
And you say, "Don't be sorry.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.522
"Don't be sorry. It's all I can do now."

50:35.000 --> 50:37.128
You want me to write this down?

50:39.880 --> 50:41.848
Do you want me
to write you a fucking letter?

50:44.720 --> 50:46.529
Me and Arthur can't write it down...

50:48.000 --> 50:50.321
...cos they haven't invented
the fucking words.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.407
We don't have the fucking words.

50:59.840 --> 51:01.126
And the worst thing is...

51:03.240 --> 51:04.765
...could've stayed at school.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.162
But we volunteered.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.328
Still don't have the fucking words.

51:21.640 --> 51:23.529
Should you choose to depart, Tommy,

51:23.640 --> 51:25.927
either by your own hand
or someone else's,

51:26.040 --> 51:28.611
the person who would take your place
is me.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.041
Legally.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.810
Financially.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.001
Everything.

51:35.240 --> 51:37.049
I need to know there'll be something left.

51:38.240 --> 51:41.403
Well, you know, Lizzie, in my head,
I still pay you for it, so...

51:42.680 --> 51:44.284
...good luck with me.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.403

52:29.280 --> 52:31.442

OK, kids, come on, let's go to bed.
Quickly.

53:09.400 --> 53:10.811
- Why?
- Who's coming?

53:10.920 --> 53:14.129
That's the thing, Charles, we don't know.
We never know.

The man's gone fucking mad, Tom!

54:03.560 --> 54:05.608
You did this?

54:05.720 --> 54:07.688
With one arm and a hammer.

54:08.760 --> 54:12.560
And a mighty pain...and a mighty fury!

54:15.520 --> 54:16.931
They killed him.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.246
My son!

54:21.240 --> 54:24.767
They shot him and they put him
up on a fucking cross,

54:24.880 --> 54:26.564
and he's fucking dead!

54:27.600 --> 54:28.931
Who did?

54:42.000 --> 54:45.243
Onlyjohnny Dogs and his kin knew
where we were camped.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.931
No, Tom. No.
I swear to God, I never told a soul.

54:48.040 --> 54:50.566
- Get the fuck away!
- I never told a fucking soul.

If you don't get it fixed,
you'll lose your arm.

avenge the death of his son, eh?
