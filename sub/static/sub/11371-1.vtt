WEBVTT

01:51.744 --> 01:53.939
Hey, what's going on, Donnie?

01:54.514 --> 01:57.677
- Hey, Larry. You wanna play?
- You knoW What? I can't.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.775
I'm late,
and I gotta get something to eat.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.376
My boss is a dickweed.

02:01.488 --> 02:04.753
Dickweed. Dickweed. Dickweed!

02:06.426 --> 02:07.654
I'm okay.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.919
I love that kid.

02:14.934 --> 02:16.231
Dickweed!

02:49.569 --> 02:51.161
Young man,

02:51.271 --> 02:54.729
do you have
any freshly-squeezed orange juice?

02:57.043 --> 02:59.944
I got your fresh squeeze
right here, grandma.

03:33.646 --> 03:36.080
Who the hell do you think you are?

03:36.983 --> 03:40.817
Name's Larry,
and I'm the health inspector.

03:41.588 --> 03:44.182
Brother, you is out of business.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.747
Excuse me. Excuse me.

04:18.124 --> 04:21.651
Hey, Jack Dabbs!
New job keeping you on your toes?

04:22.028 --> 04:24.895
- Is that your idea of a joke, Larry?
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.590
I just thought...
You know, you're the new guy.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.098
Hey, look, MoonPies.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.761
It's the original
tasty marshmallow sandwich.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.030
I'll give you pick of the litter.

04:32.138 --> 04:34.368
Oh, yeah, sure.
Give the guy in the chair first dibs.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.567
- No, I didn't mean it like that at all.
- Son of a bitch.

04:36.676 --> 04:40.043
Let me help you. Hold on.
Let me help you get through here.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.541
Oh, Larry,
Tatlock wants to see you right away.

04:48.554 --> 04:50.647
Hey, what's up, Tattycakes?

04:51.491 --> 04:52.719
I can't believe What I'm reading.

04:52.825 --> 04:56.921
Oh, man, don't tell me gay bashers
are sending you hate mail again.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.492
The city is being sued

05:00.967 --> 05:03.527
for a damaged coccyx.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.230
- You think that's funny?
- No, I don't think it's funny.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.205
I'm crying on the inside, okay?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.709
Once again, you've defiled and violated

05:11.811 --> 05:13.506
the very citizens
you've sworn to protect.

05:13.613 --> 05:16.173
You weren't even working under
the jurisdiction of this department.

05:16.282 --> 05:21.117
Nobody writes out more code violations
than me, Larry.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.882
And nobody leaves a bigger trail
of destruction in their wake.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.514
Well, it's about time
I'm getting recognized.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.718
I'm not giving you a compliment.

05:27.827 --> 05:32.161
You know, since I can't babysit
your inbred hillbilly ass 24 hours a day,

05:32.265 --> 05:33.823
I've decided to assign you a partner.

05:33.933 --> 05:37.334
A partner?
Now, come on, you know I Work alone.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.505
I drive alone, I inspect alone,

05:42.075 --> 05:44.373
sometimes I'll even have sex alone.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.340
But never on company time.
That's my policy.

05:47.447 --> 05:51.247
- Anyway, I work alone.
- Not anymore.

05:52.151 --> 05:53.345
Butlin!

05:53.920 --> 05:58.152
- You called me in, sir?
- You gotta be kidding me.

05:58.958 --> 06:02.985
First I lose my promotion
to the pissed-off crippled feller

06:03.096 --> 06:05.257
that's only been here three weeks,

06:05.365 --> 06:08.664
and now you expect me,
a man of my tenure,

06:08.768 --> 06:11.066
to work With a dadgum boy.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.865
I'm Amy Butlin.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.770
So your parents gave you a girly name
to toughen you up. I like that.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.872
I've been very eager
to be part of a collaboration

06:23.983 --> 06:25.848
ever since I graduated
from the Academy.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.045
Really want to get out in the field and...

06:36.696 --> 06:39.358
You ever fart so hard your back cracks?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.424
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

06:42.535 --> 06:44.867
Good Lord Jesus
and Dale Earnhardt Jr.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.337
I am a dadgum ticking time bomb.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.105
That's my partner?

06:54.313 --> 06:55.644
Seriously?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.714
Good luck.

07:01.454 --> 07:02.648
Larry?

07:03.856 --> 07:05.585
Larry, I figured I'd drive.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.156
With gas prices where they are

07:07.260 --> 07:10.195
and American dependency
on foreign fuel at an all-time high...

07:12.765 --> 07:15.461
Hey, Butlin, get in a real vehicle.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.162
Hell's that thing run on?
StraWberry douche?

07:20.506 --> 07:21.700
Park it.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.152
What are you doing?

07:33.252 --> 07:36.187
Hey. whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey! what are you doing?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.655
I was throWing these items
into your external cargo bay.

07:38.758 --> 07:41.056
Number one,
it's gonna blow out, all right?

07:41.160 --> 07:44.288
And number two,
it's making my truck look trashy.

07:44.564 --> 07:48.432
Butlin, this is the Larrymobile.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.391
You respect the Larrymobile.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.528
Now, I don't want you moving nothing
or touching nothing

07:52.638 --> 07:56.130
without the express written consent
of me, Larry.

07:56.742 --> 07:58.004
We clear?

07:58.277 --> 08:02.611
- Respect the Larrymobile. Got it.
- Climb in.

08:05.918 --> 08:09.183
Come on, son.
You act like you're 90 years old.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.754
Let's go clean up the town.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.695
NoW, if you don't mind, Larry,
I Would actually prefer shadowing you

08:26.806 --> 08:28.831
from the other side,
from the food prep area.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.876
That way I can take notes
and observe your procedure.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.412
- All right, Butlin, you go ahead.
- Okay.

08:38.551 --> 08:39.518
Morning.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.118
This fish is raw!

08:44.790 --> 08:47.350
What are you trying to do,
poison these folks in here?

08:56.802 --> 08:59.703
- Larry!
- Sakamoto! How you doing, buddy?

08:59.805 --> 09:00.931
Very fine.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.905
But you look good.
You been Working out?

09:03.009 --> 09:05.500
- Pushups.
- Well, you do look good.

09:06.345 --> 09:09.007
You try blowfish. Rare delicacy.

09:12.485 --> 09:16.353
Tell you what, I'd rather dip French fries
in my grandma's bedsores.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.214
I don't mean to interrupt,

09:19.325 --> 09:22.055
but may I bring up
Subpart 4-501 of the Food Code?

09:22.161 --> 09:26.291
Believe me,
if Sakamoto made it, I've brought it up.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.157
I'm referring specifically
to the part about

09:28.267 --> 09:30.326
Warewashing Process Evaluation.

09:30.436 --> 09:33.098
The accepted procedure is to expose
a securely-tied remote probe

09:33.205 --> 09:35.833
of a thermocouple or the sensor
of a Well-shielded maximum

09:35.942 --> 09:39.275
registering at least 4.8 on the scale.
So, if We could possibly go back...

09:39.378 --> 09:40.936
- Butlin.
- Yes. What?

09:42.114 --> 09:44.514
You ain't gonna believe this,
but there's a snoW cone vendor

09:44.617 --> 09:46.414
- out there not wearing a bra.
- What?

09:46.519 --> 09:48.146
Is that a violation?

09:48.254 --> 09:50.347
No, but it makes me
wanna get a snoW cone.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.416
Just watch that guy.

10:13.512 --> 10:16.276
What the hell is that?
Smells like deer urine.

10:16.382 --> 10:19.351
It's not deer urine.
I have sensitive contacts.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.813
- Hey, you want a MoonPie?
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.555
I've got a whole glove compartment
full of them.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.058
I can see that.

10:39.672 --> 10:42.368
- What are you doing?
- I found a buyer for these.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.306
Do you know
how many $400 bottles of wine

10:44.410 --> 10:46.674
we have gathering dust back here?

10:46.779 --> 10:50.271
Would you prefer offering
our customers wine by the box?

10:50.950 --> 10:54.181
I would prefer you don't run
our mother's restaurant into the ground.

10:54.286 --> 10:57.278
Well, honey, the All City Top Chef
is in a feW days.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.291
If we win, we'll be fine. I told you that.

11:01.260 --> 11:04.661
You also told me
I could start bartending or waitressing.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.961
- That never happened.
- well, I mean,

11:08.100 --> 11:11.900
you know, being in charge of security
is a big responsibility.

11:14.940 --> 11:18.740
- You're ashamed of me.
- No. Oh, don't be ridiculous.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.642
You wanted me to lose Weight,
and I went on Atkins.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.648
You wanted me
to dress for success, and...

11:25.017 --> 11:26.882
Okay. You know what? You're right.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.413
I'll tell you what.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.453
Once we get through the All City,

11:32.258 --> 11:35.421
we'll talk about expanding your role
at Micelli's.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.388
That's my girl.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.503
Hey, let me ask you something.
You think you could make me

11:52.611 --> 11:55.637
- one of them fancy head deals?
- Sure.

11:55.748 --> 11:58.342
Please, Larry, try our chicken dhansak.

11:59.485 --> 12:03.353
- Chicken dans-what?
- It is one of our popular dish.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.618
You don't want me eating that
next to an open flame.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.492
Do you noW, or have you
to the best of your knowledge,

12:11.597 --> 12:14.964
ever had an infected Wound
containing pus,

12:15.201 --> 12:18.500
such as a lesion or boil
on the hands or wrists?

12:18.604 --> 12:21.869
And has this infected Wound
that may or may not contain pus

12:21.974 --> 12:26.673
protected With an impermeable cover
such as a finger cot or a...

12:27.346 --> 12:29.075
Larry, what...

12:32.284 --> 12:33.876
I'm reporting you for that.

12:33.986 --> 12:37.353
Oh, come on, Butlin.
That immigrant food ain't that bad.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.651
You deliberately impeded
my line of questioning.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.556
You undermined me
and made it impossible for me

12:41.660 --> 12:42.786
to carry out my duties.

12:42.895 --> 12:45.261
You didn't see any health hazards
in there.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.424
What you seen
was a bunch of hard-Working people.

12:48.534 --> 12:52.300
Now, they may not know how
to speak English good, like what I do,

12:52.972 --> 12:55.736
but they ain't doing anybody
no harm, either.

12:55.841 --> 12:58.810
So I sometimes let them slide
on the small stuff,

12:59.512 --> 13:00.809
and they take real good care,

13:00.913 --> 13:02.744
and then I never have to bust them
on the big stuff.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.476
And your thoughtless actions
resulted in the loss of my contact lens,

13:05.584 --> 13:07.882
which means noW I have to go back
to LensCrafters to replace them,

13:07.987 --> 13:09.249
and the mall is noWhere near...

13:31.443 --> 13:34.241
Damn it, Butlin,
respect the Larrymobile.

14:30.336 --> 14:31.894
Lord, are you okay?

14:33.138 --> 14:34.765
Are you all right?

14:35.474 --> 14:37.908
Listen, these mannequins,
it's not your fault.

14:38.477 --> 14:40.445
- They are not very limber.
- Oh, God.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.679
The ones I got at the house, you can
barely get the leg up over the ears,

14:43.782 --> 14:45.943
and they just snap off like a tWig on...

14:46.051 --> 14:48.519
Well, I don't do that.
My cousin does that.

14:48.621 --> 14:52.079
Nice work, Jane. Very creative.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.854
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.656
Yeah, well, you did.

14:57.796 --> 15:00.026
And enough
With your lame apologies, okay?

15:00.132 --> 15:02.760
- I mean, you sound like a broken record.
- Hey, Wait a second.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.597
She had nothing to do
with them chest baskets

15:04.703 --> 15:07.069
- hitting the floors.
- "Chest baskets"?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.406
- Boulder holders.
- "Boulder holders"?

15:10.676 --> 15:12.303
Look, I could do this all day.

15:12.678 --> 15:15.272
The point is,
you gotta buy these and test-drive them

15:15.381 --> 15:16.473
before you put them on.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.879
I mean,
you don't wanna get one, get home,

15:17.983 --> 15:19.883
make your titties all cattywampus.

15:19.985 --> 15:22.647
Good Lord,
makes fellers cross-eyed and whatnot.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.189
- It ain't Christian.
- Right. I'm gonna have to ask you

15:25.291 --> 15:27.088
to vacate the premises, sir.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.925
You hold on a second there.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.394
I'm the health inspector,

15:32.531 --> 15:35.329
- and what we got here...
- Is not food-related.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.560
Well, that depends.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.502
According to the C-section
of the Penile Code,

15:39.605 --> 15:43.302
a lot of these edible underbritches
need to be refrigerated.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.673
Sir, get out.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.273
Out.

15:57.256 --> 15:59.019
I'm really sorry.

16:03.429 --> 16:06.398
Excuse me.
Hey, excuse me, ma'am? Excuse me.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.562
- Hey. I'm Larry.
- I'm Jane. Jane Whitley.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.070
Jane, are you okay?

16:14.173 --> 16:16.107
I didn't cause you any trouble in there,
did I?

16:16.208 --> 16:19.302
Yeah, well, I just got fired.

16:19.411 --> 16:22.346
But when you think about it,

16:22.448 --> 16:24.643
I did kind of deserve it, really.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.308
Don't tell me I got you fired.

16:26.418 --> 16:27.908
- No.
- Oh, thank God.

16:28.020 --> 16:32.081
She said I was lazy and irresponsible

16:32.191 --> 16:33.556
and unreliable.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.684
Well, those sound like
the story of my life, too.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.319
Larry, where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

16:38.430 --> 16:41.126
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, I didn't mean to interrupt.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.463
I'm not an impeder. This is my partner.

16:43.569 --> 16:47.096
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
- Not like partner-partner.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.367
Not like gay partners.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.642
He works under me.
We... No, I mean... Damn it.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.714
You're always butling in.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.645
That's kind of funny.
Your last name's Butlin,

16:58.751 --> 17:00.742
so, you see, you're kind of butling in.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.619
It's a joke.

17:07.526 --> 17:11.087
- Big Shug made the Top 10.
- I know.

17:11.195 --> 17:15.394
That All City Top Chef's a big deal.
They's a lot of restaurants in that.

17:15.501 --> 17:19.733
You know, started With 300.
300 pretenders, but only one king.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.199
I'm gonna tell you,
I'm pulling for you, Shug.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.435
You knoW I am. You know why?

17:26.111 --> 17:29.274
'Cause you dream big,
just like your name. Big Shug.

17:32.084 --> 17:35.747
Just so you knoW, when I win,
I ain't gonna forget my friends.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.886
Right. I already forget all my friends,
and I ain't never Won a damn thing.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.194
You knoW What I'm gonna do
with that $250,000?

17:46.298 --> 17:49.165
- Hopefully get me four new truck tires.
- Nope.

17:49.268 --> 17:52.237
Man, come on, Shug.
Hook a brother up, playa.

17:52.538 --> 17:56.167
No. I'm gonna open up Big Shug's
all across the country.

17:56.442 --> 17:59.741
- Finally get Whitey off my back.
- Let me ask you something.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.836
Why you gotta call us "Whitey"
all the time?

18:01.947 --> 18:03.380
I mean, that's pretty racialistic.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.950
He ain't white.
That's my landlord's name.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.747
Whitey Johnson.
He just as black as me.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.548
I'm just saying.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.651
Tell you What, though,
you got some balls

18:13.759 --> 18:15.886
getting in
that All City Big Chef tournament.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.962
I mean,
they's some good restaurants in there.

18:18.630 --> 18:21.292
You know who had big balls?
My grandpa.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.892
He got stung by a bee
right doWn there in the testicular area.

18:25.003 --> 18:28.530
Sumbitches swolled up.
I mean, they was infected.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.242
Looked like he Was sitting
on a beanbag chair

18:31.343 --> 18:33.174
every time I went over to his house.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.743
We ended up getting him
a testicle tourniquet.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.406
A testicle tourniquet?

18:38.083 --> 18:40.711
- Yeah, a oyster catcher.
- Oyster catcher?

18:41.587 --> 18:42.918
I can do this all day.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.784
Larry, if you're done here,

18:44.890 --> 18:48.348
there are a few items
that require your attention in the back.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.491
Hey, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

18:55.601 --> 18:58.001
I gotta take the BroWns
to the Super BoWl.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.295
Hey, Larry, the men's room is out of TP.

19:01.406 --> 19:04.034
This is all the butt-Wiping paper I need
right here.

19:25.297 --> 19:26.491
- Thank you for your time.
- Sure.

19:26.598 --> 19:27.895
Okay. Okay, bye.

19:39.044 --> 19:40.978
Let me help you, Jack. Here we go.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.448
NoW, see how we done that?
That's teamwork right there, buddy.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.346
Appreciate you coming doWn.

19:49.454 --> 19:50.785
Let me help you out With your beer.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.255
Don't be an asshole, Larry.
My arms aren't paralyzed.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.952
Hey, man, I'm just trying to help out.

19:56.895 --> 20:00.331
So, how's that new partner
Working out for you?

20:01.133 --> 20:03.294
Don't even talk about Butlin.

20:03.869 --> 20:08.431
I promised myself tonight Butlin
is staying out of the conversations.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.205
I'll tell you what pisses me off
about Butlin.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.536
You ever see that program, Sesame Street?

20:14.813 --> 20:16.974
Bert and Arnie, them little fellers.
You ever see them?

20:17.082 --> 20:19.516
- Yeah.
- That was a team, all right?

20:19.785 --> 20:22.948
They got all their Work done,
but yet they had dadgum fun.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.583
Butlin is too uptight.

20:27.492 --> 20:30.757
He's loud, he's gross, he's rude.

20:31.330 --> 20:34.663
He urinated in a thermos
on the Way to an inspection.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.998
I don't knoW. You think it might be
'cause of some freak accident

20:39.104 --> 20:41.299
that Butlin Was born that way?

20:42.541 --> 20:45.169
I don't knoW. I probably ought to be
a good Christian about it.

20:45.277 --> 20:49.680
Here I am,
blessed With square-jaWed good looks

20:49.781 --> 20:52.807
and firm, muscular buttocks
and good health.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.909
That's the important one, good health.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.648
Gotta have good health,
or nothing else matters.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.681
Shame to have all that

21:00.792 --> 21:03.317
and then Butlin's got this bug
that lives up his ass.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.055
Just ain't fair.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.331
You're talking to a guy
Who feels nothing from the waist doWn

21:08.433 --> 21:11.095
about someone
having a bug up their ass?

21:11.670 --> 21:13.695
It's not that he doesn't knoW
what he's doing.

21:13.805 --> 21:15.773
I mean,
when there's a serious code violation,

21:15.874 --> 21:17.569
he's quick enough to Write it up.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.338
It's just that
he doesn't take the job seriously.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.310
And it's a serious job.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.547
Come on, let me help you out.
You haven't had a drink all...

21:25.651 --> 21:27.175
- Jack, I'm just trying...
- I don't Want it.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.015
Have a...

21:29.121 --> 21:31.715
Now, look What you've gone
and done, Jack.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.223
I didn't mean to do that.
I was just trying to help you out,

21:34.326 --> 21:37.386
and you went and spilled it.
Now, just stand still. Oh, damn!

21:38.330 --> 21:41.094
After lunch today,
he told me there Was a broWn snake

21:41.199 --> 21:43.690
playing peek-a-boo With his butt hole.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.928
I aced Bio. I do not recall broWn snakes.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.740
Check it out.

21:51.076 --> 21:54.944
I'm so glad We finally came here.
This place is so amazing.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.372
The best is yet to come.

21:57.482 --> 22:01.441
- I don't have room for dessert, Tad.
- I'm not talking about dessert.

22:01.553 --> 22:03.783
Debbie Goldstein,

22:05.090 --> 22:07.058
Will you do me the honor...

22:08.860 --> 22:11.590
- Tad?
- What? That was the chair.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.387
- Just the chair.
- Oh.

22:16.134 --> 22:18.602
Debbie Goldstein...

22:19.971 --> 22:21.336
Oh, my God!

22:24.776 --> 22:25.936
Debbie.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.748
Where's the ladies' room?
Oh, my stomach.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.579
- Oh, God.
- God, that's disgusting!

22:36.755 --> 22:37.847
Almost cleaned up.

22:37.956 --> 22:41.016
My phone's ringing.
I'm gonna leave you these napkins.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.387
Larry's the name,
health inspecting's the game.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.223
Are you serious?

22:48.333 --> 22:50.563
I'm gonna be doWn there.
Don't touch nothing.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.807
Never mind.

22:57.476 --> 23:00.036
Jack, I'm sorry.
I forgot that you Were still in there.

23:01.079 --> 23:04.105
You want me to help you through these?
I'll help you. Okay.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.774
Somebody take care of him.

23:15.093 --> 23:18.358
- Incoming call.
- Butlin.

23:20.265 --> 23:21.254
What?

23:22.134 --> 23:23.260
Health inspector.

23:23.368 --> 23:26.633
Nobody leaves,
nobody enters without my say-so.

23:26.738 --> 23:30.003
NoW, we're gonna need
to cordon off the area... What the hell?

23:32.310 --> 23:35.370
Excuse me, sir, We require a jacket.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.647
Well, you're gonna require stitches,
there, Frere Jacques,

23:38.750 --> 23:41.082
- you don't let me in there.
- You must have a reservation.

23:41.186 --> 23:44.246
I do have a reservation.
Fist, party of five.

23:52.431 --> 23:56.231
Jane? I didn't knoW you speak Spanish.
That's pretty good.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.303
Boy, you don't waste any time, do you?

23:59.404 --> 24:02.305
Last time I seen you,
you Was up at the panty store

24:02.407 --> 24:05.342
With your hands
all over a naked plastic Woman.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.379
'Course, you could say the same thing
about me as well.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.448
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.184
Hey, you're that woman from the mall.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.352
Neat.
I'm gonna take some food samples.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.363
Yeah, why don't you go
take some food samples?

24:26.465 --> 24:30.561
She really is your partner-partner.
I just got that.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.059
WoW.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.106
WoW. Pretty and smart.
We do have a lot in common.

24:37.008 --> 24:39.841
Don't you have an investigation
to conduct?

24:40.011 --> 24:43.344
Oh, believe me, I'm conducting.
Believe me.

24:44.850 --> 24:45.874
Butlin!

24:45.984 --> 24:47.781
- To the kitchen.
- Okay.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.479
Larry.

24:53.391 --> 24:55.484
- What are you doing here?
- I'll handle this.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.328
Boss, we was on-call tonight.

24:58.864 --> 25:01.094
We got a call
about some farting JeWish folks.

25:01.199 --> 25:02.223
We responded.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.098
Also, I'm working on this little number
over here in the black skirt.

25:05.203 --> 25:07.296
You're out of your league, numbnuts.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.234
I tell you what.
Why don't you go over to Sizzler

25:09.341 --> 25:11.832
and see if they got enough wet naps?

25:13.078 --> 25:15.444
Yeah, that's hilarious.

25:20.285 --> 25:23.652
- Come on, Butlin. We's off the case.
- What? Why?

25:23.788 --> 25:25.415
Ask Tatlock.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.327
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, God, not again.

25:31.029 --> 25:34.521
Get a whiff of that. That smell familiar?

25:35.567 --> 25:36.534
Yeah.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.227
Yeah, it smells like the drops
I use for my...

25:38.336 --> 25:39.769
- Shit!
- Excuse me?

25:39.871 --> 25:40.838
Oh.

25:41.172 --> 25:43.333
That's what happens When
you put eye drops in someone's drink.

25:43.441 --> 25:45.602
It gives them the wicked shits.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.647
I used to be a barmaid, and We'd do it
to customers Who stiffed us.

25:49.748 --> 25:52.046
- Neat.
- Why are you still here?

25:52.150 --> 25:53.811
Boss, listen.
I'm gonna tell you right now.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.750
This might be a put-up job.

25:55.854 --> 25:58.345
I think somebody's putting something
in the water around here.

25:58.456 --> 26:00.651
The only thing
that's gonna get put up around here

26:00.759 --> 26:05.093
is my foot up your ass,
if you do not leave immediately.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.598
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.562
- But how about...
- An order.

26:11.036 --> 26:12.435
- How about...
- Stop.

26:12.604 --> 26:13.593
- If I...
- Don't.

26:13.705 --> 26:14.672
I...

26:20.078 --> 26:23.741
Oh, thanks. I knoW, it's the dry air.
I get boogers all the time.

26:23.848 --> 26:28.251
No, no, no, that...
That was my phone number.

26:30.822 --> 26:32.187
I kneW that.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.924
I would be happy to look into that,
Ms. Micelli

26:41.032 --> 26:42.795
Thank you, Mr. Mayor

26:43.635 --> 26:45.227
- Vera?
- Yes, Mr. Mayor?

26:45.737 --> 26:49.673
Yes, can you pull the file
on TWilight Moments Assisted Living?

26:49.774 --> 26:52.607
I Wanna make sure I'm prepared
for the groundbreaking tomorroW.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.042
Thank you.

27:09.394 --> 27:12.420
I could jot down some talking points
on Medicare and prescription drugs

27:12.530 --> 27:14.054
for seniors, if that would be helpful.

27:14.165 --> 27:16.497
- Oh, no, thank you.
- All right.

27:16.601 --> 27:20.093
It breaks my heart that we can't
help these old people anymore.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.365
I know.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.941
Your reservations are also confirmed
for tonight at Micelli's.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.875
Oh, Micelli's. That...
My wife just loves the tiramisu.

27:26.978 --> 27:27.945
It's delicious.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.911
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Mr. Mayor?

27:30.015 --> 27:31.482
- Maybe there is.
- Yes, sir.

27:31.583 --> 27:35.280
Would it be out of line if I asked you
if you could just rub my shoulders?

27:35.387 --> 27:36.649
Yeah, it kind of would.

27:36.755 --> 27:39.588
Well, that's why I didn't ask you.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.325
- If that'll be all.
- Yes, thank you, Vera.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.828
- Thank you, sir.
- See you tomorroW.

27:47.966 --> 27:49.695
What is her problem?

27:53.238 --> 27:56.264
- I'm not happy.
- Oh, man, you got more letters?

27:56.708 --> 27:58.801
Don't worry, boss,
they're just allegations.

27:58.910 --> 28:01.708
I mean, look, you got a wife
that's semi-good-looking,

28:01.813 --> 28:03.838
a couple squirrelly kids
running around the house.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.813
I mean,
that spells "real man" in my book.

28:05.917 --> 28:09.819
There were rat droppings
in the food at Clarito's last night.

28:09.921 --> 28:11.752
NoW, that's our finest
five-star restaurant.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.290
We've never had a complaint
about them before.

28:14.392 --> 28:17.054
This comes chronologically adjacent
to last Week's incident

28:17.162 --> 28:19.357
- at Les Deux Coquilles.
- Lay who where?

28:19.698 --> 28:22.667
- The French restaurant.
- Your emergency call, remember?

28:22.767 --> 28:24.928
Well, I remember me and the boy here

28:25.270 --> 28:27.363
coming up With some hard evidence
of foul play,

28:27.472 --> 28:29.736
but nobody paid us no mind.

28:29.841 --> 28:32.674
For some incomprehensible reason,

28:32.777 --> 28:37.146
the Mayor's office has requested
that you, specifically you,

28:37.248 --> 28:40.342
be assigned
to investigate the Clarito's incident.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.148
Like the song goes,
you must have friends in high places.

28:43.254 --> 28:45.449
No, that's Friends in Low Places.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.488
- Different song.
- Who sings it?

28:47.592 --> 28:49.924
Look, it doesn't matter, all right?

28:50.028 --> 28:53.794
I don't care what kind of strings
you pulled to get this gig.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.995
ScreW this one up.

28:56.868 --> 28:58.768
I'm begging you, Larry.

28:59.537 --> 29:03.098
Did the rodent droppings
have any specific shape or form?

29:03.308 --> 29:06.607
I have been Working 10 years
to build the reputation of Clarito's

29:06.711 --> 29:08.440
into a nice, clean, respectable joint.

29:08.546 --> 29:10.343
Look, believe me,
We sympathize, Chef Carmine.

29:10.448 --> 29:12.848
I'm assuming you've never had
a rodent problem like this in the past.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.351
Rats? Are you kidding me?
I mean, I'm mortified.

29:15.453 --> 29:16.920
Well, guess what?

29:17.021 --> 29:20.513
You got a whole nest of them,
big mothers.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.227
Rattus norvegicus.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.227
Norway rats.

29:25.897 --> 29:29.389
Come over to this country from Europe,
I'd say around, oh, 1774.

29:29.534 --> 29:32.731
But there's one thing that concerns me
about these here rats.

29:32.971 --> 29:37.067
Every kind of rat, be it a seWer rat
or a field rat or a rug rat,

29:37.175 --> 29:39.109
is basically a Norway rat.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.678
I thought this rat Was the same
as in my bathroom,

29:41.780 --> 29:43.543
regular big city rats.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.408
However, there's one difference here.

29:47.218 --> 29:49.652
Look at the turd-cutter on that thing.
Look at that.

29:49.754 --> 29:51.813
It's too clean. It is too clean.

29:52.257 --> 29:53.588
It don't stink. Nothing.

29:53.691 --> 29:58.025
That only mean one thing.
That there is a lab rat, which means...

29:58.129 --> 29:59.721
Someone planted these rats here.

29:59.831 --> 30:00.855
- Exactly.
- Oh, boy.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.456
Who Would besmirch
the name of Clarito in such a manner?

30:03.568 --> 30:04.967
- Who?
- You got enemies?

30:05.069 --> 30:06.730
I only have friends.

30:06.838 --> 30:08.362
Former employees that are mad at you?

30:08.473 --> 30:10.065
- No.
- Ex-wives wanna make you suffer?

30:10.175 --> 30:11.199
No, nobody. No.

30:11.342 --> 30:13.674
HoW about strippers that said
you'd buy them a neW pair of titties

30:13.778 --> 30:15.507
'cause you said something
you shouldn't have said one night

30:15.613 --> 30:17.604
when you was drunk in the bar
and then her boyfriend

30:17.715 --> 30:19.649
threatened to kill you, so you had
to change your phone number,

30:19.751 --> 30:22.185
- and even that didn't work...
- Larry.

30:22.287 --> 30:24.687
Well, I'm just covering the bases.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.285
This is your idea of evidence?

30:28.760 --> 30:32.594
- "The rats' butts are too clean."
- That's right, Tatster.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.454
Case is closed.

30:34.766 --> 30:39.430
However, there's just two little,
teeny pieces of the puzzle we need.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.169
Who done it and why?

30:42.941 --> 30:45.569
This ain't some isolationist event.

30:46.544 --> 30:49.206
- Here's what I think.
- I don't give a rat's ass what you think.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.314
All right?

30:51.216 --> 30:52.843
What is so damn hilarious?

30:52.951 --> 30:54.942
You just said "rat's ass."

30:55.820 --> 30:57.617
I mean, don't you think
that's kind of funny?

30:57.722 --> 31:01.385
I mean, considering we was just talking
about rats' asses.

31:02.393 --> 31:04.122
That is an amusing coincidence.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.095
Out.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.408
Get out!

31:19.344 --> 31:21.505
What's happening?
Are We following up on a lead?

31:21.613 --> 31:23.604
Did we make a break in the case?

31:23.715 --> 31:25.910
If that break in the case
involves me getting some,

31:26.017 --> 31:29.180
- We just knocked it Wide open.
- Getting some What?

31:30.321 --> 31:32.846
- Oh.
- That's right.

31:32.957 --> 31:36.620
Seems like your mentor and role model

31:37.028 --> 31:39.963
just got himself a date With Jane,
the waitress.

31:40.064 --> 31:43.431
I'm gonna take her down there
to the buffet at the bus station.

31:43.534 --> 31:46.731
- Sounds romantic.
- Butlin, a man's got needs, all right?

31:46.838 --> 31:49.329
I mean, you ought to know.
Hell, I seen you making goo-goo eyes

31:49.440 --> 31:51.237
- at Big Shug.
- Excuse me?

31:51.342 --> 31:55.005
Don't get all defenseless, all right?
I don't care if you sWing the other way.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.673
I mean, come on, I'm not homeopathic.

31:59.350 --> 32:02.513
Are you really taking her
to a buffet at a bus station?

32:02.654 --> 32:06.681
I mean, take her someWhere special.
She'll never see it coming.

32:06.791 --> 32:09.157
Keep burning the midnight oil, Butlin,
all right?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.285
Leave the lady-killing to me.

32:21.806 --> 32:24.240
Hey, Ironsides, I knoW you're busy.
I don't wanna interrupt you.

32:24.342 --> 32:26.867
But, listen,
you're working the five-star beat, right?

32:26.978 --> 32:28.775
You knoW,
the one with all the foreign menus

32:28.880 --> 32:30.438
and cripple ramps and whatnot?

32:30.548 --> 32:33.278
- Yes.
- I got a date with this girl Jane,

32:33.384 --> 32:35.875
who's the creme de la creme.

32:35.987 --> 32:38.979
And get this.
Butlin wants me to take her doWn there

32:39.090 --> 32:41.456
to that buffet by the bus station.

32:41.659 --> 32:44.822
- A buffet on a bus?
- Exactly. You believe that?

32:45.730 --> 32:48.858
I wanna take her someplace nice
so she thinks I'm a classy guy.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.195
Can you help me?

32:50.702 --> 32:52.260
I'm not a miracle worker.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.767
Well, obviously not.

32:53.871 --> 32:55.736
If you was,
you'd have got up out of that wheelchair

32:55.840 --> 32:57.774
and kicked my ass a couple weeks ago.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.408
Seriously, I need something fancy.

33:04.882 --> 33:06.816
- Yeah, I might knoW a place.
- Cool.

33:07.952 --> 33:10.648
- Micelli's
- Hey, it's Jack Dabbs

33:10.755 --> 33:12.723
- well hello Jack

33:12.857 --> 33:16.156
My colleague Larry is coming in tonight.
Take care of him, okay?

33:16.260 --> 33:18.057
I most certainly will.

33:23.234 --> 33:24.201
Hi.

33:26.404 --> 33:28.304
I can't believe
you got a reservation here.

33:28.406 --> 33:30.397
I think it takes, like, months
to get a table.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.966
Not that I would know.
I mean, I don't really get out that much.

33:34.078 --> 33:37.104
Well, doors open
when you're with Larry.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.315
HoW you doing, partner?

33:40.618 --> 33:42.176
Listen, called earlier,

33:42.286 --> 33:46.188
talked to François, Antonio,
something or other.

33:46.290 --> 33:49.521
But they had saved me
a couple seats doWn here.

33:49.627 --> 33:51.492
I don't think so, sir.

33:53.498 --> 33:57.298
Well, I'm sure they did.
Can I look in your little fancy book?

33:58.603 --> 34:00.161
Yep, there I am right there.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.933
- That's you?
- Yes, sir.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.376
- Denzel Washington?
- Yeah.

34:05.476 --> 34:08.467
I own Denzel's Leaf and Lawn Service.

34:08.579 --> 34:09.876
You knoW what,
you ought to come doWn there.

34:09.981 --> 34:13.438
You look like a guy
that would appreciate getting bloWed.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.018
Larry, it's okay.
We don't have to eat here. We...

34:16.120 --> 34:17.985
- Larry, isn't it?
- Well, lookie here.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.023
- It is so nice to see you.
- Mayor, hoW are you?

34:20.123 --> 34:22.284
Actually, that's Denzel Washington.

34:22.659 --> 34:23.684
HoW dare you?

34:23.795 --> 34:25.922
This man
is a hardworking public servant,

34:26.030 --> 34:28.260
and you have the audacity
to put him doWn like that?

34:28.366 --> 34:30.266
I didn't. It Was him, sir.

34:31.601 --> 34:34.696
Mr. Mayor,
please accept my sincere apologies.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.331
- I'll take you to your table.
- I am sure you Will.

34:38.309 --> 34:39.708
See you later. Come on, baby.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.245
I'm so hungry
I could eat the butt hole out of a skunk.

34:59.330 --> 35:00.524
I dropped my balls.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.067
I'll get it.

35:03.334 --> 35:06.269
Usually, a feller's balls don't drop
till he's 65.

35:06.370 --> 35:07.462
Larry.

35:07.572 --> 35:09.597
- Good evening. I'm Lily Micelli.
- Larry!

35:10.708 --> 35:12.300
- Hello. Hi.
- What the hell?

35:12.410 --> 35:13.399
How are you doing?

35:13.511 --> 35:14.705
- Fine, thank you.
- Wonderful.

35:14.812 --> 35:18.145
Larry, this is Lily Micelli, the owner.

35:19.417 --> 35:22.409
- Miss Machiavelli, hoW are you?
- Very well, thank you.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.250
You run a nice restaurant in here.

35:25.356 --> 35:27.347
Let me ask you something.
Do you got one of them toilets

35:27.458 --> 35:30.120
Where it shoots cold Water
up your crack?

35:34.298 --> 35:38.098
When I heard that
a member of our Health Department

35:38.202 --> 35:39.999
had been mistreated by one of our staff,

35:40.104 --> 35:42.595
- I Was appalled.
- No, don't worry about that.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.470
I wouldn't let myself in, either.

35:44.575 --> 35:46.805
Not even if somebody
would've slipped me a fifty.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.744
- Not even then.
- Oh, that's very generous of you.

35:49.847 --> 35:52.611
NoW, I would really hope
that you would accept something

35:52.717 --> 35:54.309
from our premium wine cellar.

35:54.418 --> 35:57.353
Oh, boy, that's the fancy stuff. Yeah.

35:57.455 --> 36:00.947
Fill her up.
You're living in the big time noW.

36:04.428 --> 36:06.658
No wonder you're making money.

36:07.932 --> 36:11.060
- Just taste the wine, Larry.
- Oh, yeah.

36:16.574 --> 36:18.201
Boy, that is good.

36:20.044 --> 36:22.410
I feel so comfortable with you.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.547
You knoW what?

36:23.648 --> 36:25.616
Other than my underbritches
creeping up on me,

36:25.716 --> 36:28.150
I feel pretty comfortable
around you, too.

36:32.757 --> 36:34.520
Oh, I probably
should have told you this before,

36:34.625 --> 36:36.092
but I didn't think we'd...

36:36.194 --> 36:38.025
- What is it?
- I...

36:39.130 --> 36:41.394
I live With someone, sort of.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.897
Boy, that figures.

36:44.001 --> 36:46.469
A guy like me
doesn't end up With a piece...

36:47.038 --> 36:49.632
Nice, wonderful, intelligent,
career-minded woman

36:49.740 --> 36:51.367
such as yourself.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.669
I kneW
there had to be a catch somewhere.

36:53.778 --> 36:55.803
No, no, no, no. There's no catch.

36:55.913 --> 36:58.473
- It's just...
- Well, what is it?

37:00.818 --> 37:03.616
Okay, if I let you in,

37:03.721 --> 37:07.248
you just have to promise
not to be judgmental.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.593
Shoot, I have seen some twisted stuff,
all right.

37:10.695 --> 37:13.562
Whatever you got going in here,
believe me, I can handle it.

37:13.664 --> 37:16.326
I remember
one time I had a cottage cheese...

37:18.603 --> 37:20.537
Larry, this is my mom.

37:21.739 --> 37:22.933
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.837
"Nice to meet you, ma'am."

37:25.076 --> 37:29.308
Mom, Larry works
for the Health Inspection Unit.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.813
As what? A warning sign?

37:32.350 --> 37:36.116
"Eat right, or you'll end up
looking like this piece of shit."

37:37.054 --> 37:39.545
She's a little shy around new people.

37:39.657 --> 37:43.559
Shy? Oh, man, I love sassy fat chicks.

37:46.731 --> 37:50.792
Well,
look at this silver-tongued bastard.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.299
Trying to sWeet-talk me
like I'm his third cousin.

38:00.311 --> 38:03.508
Hey, Pabst Blue Ribbon.
My kind of girl, right there.

38:07.318 --> 38:08.580
So,

38:10.221 --> 38:12.121
hoW did you become a health inspector?

38:12.623 --> 38:16.582
I mean, Working for the government,
it must be so exciting.

38:16.761 --> 38:19.389
Well, I gotta tell you,
keeping people from blowing chunks

38:19.497 --> 38:20.691
and crapping on themselves

38:20.798 --> 38:23.130
is pretty much all I ever been good at.

38:23.234 --> 38:26.397
I mean, nobody really knoWs
the responsibility I carry around.

38:26.504 --> 38:30.565
But you must have dreams
and aspirations.

38:30.708 --> 38:33.575
Boy, I gotta tell you,
I don't really have a lot of dreams.

38:34.445 --> 38:36.970
Had one a couple weeks back
after I left the bar

38:37.081 --> 38:39.914
- and had some of that skunky beer.
- Oh, yeah? What was it?

38:41.319 --> 38:44.288
Big, giant woman
made out of MoonPies.

38:44.522 --> 38:47.184
She looked a lot like Lulu
from Hee Haw.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.253
I don't have that dream about her
no more, though.

38:51.362 --> 38:54.058
No? Who do you dream about now?

38:54.165 --> 38:57.134
Little bit smaller girl.
Looks a little bit like you.

38:57.535 --> 38:59.332
In a MoonPie bikini.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.343
Any chance you didn't hear that?

39:15.219 --> 39:18.017
Listen, I apologize.
I gotta run to the toilet.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.685
My stomach ain't felt this bad
since I had them fish sticks

39:21.792 --> 39:24.124
out of the vending machine
at the Phillips 66.

39:24.228 --> 39:26.458
It's doWn the hall,
the first door on your left.

39:26.564 --> 39:27.758
I appreciate it.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.033
Oh, damn.

39:33.137 --> 39:36.698
- Is everything all right in there?
- Everything's fine. Everything's good.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.705
Good Lord Jesus and his shepherds.

39:48.119 --> 39:49.746
Are you serious?

40:12.543 --> 40:16.206
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Might need a Shop-Vac in there,

40:16.313 --> 40:17.780
but I'm doing pretty good.

40:17.882 --> 40:20.350
Well, it's getting kind of late.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.112
Yeah, but not too late
for a man and a Woman

40:22.219 --> 40:23.982
to get to know one another.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.556
Let me tell you something.
when I seen you through the window

40:26.657 --> 40:27.954
doWn there at the panty store,

40:28.058 --> 40:32.392
I said to myself, I said,
"Self, that's your someone, right there."

40:36.967 --> 40:38.764
I bet that left a mark.

40:39.236 --> 40:41.898
Sounds like you got something honking
for the right of way.

40:44.008 --> 40:46.135
Larry, I think you should go.

40:46.610 --> 40:49.636
Yeah, it is getting kind of late.
Maybe I ought to leave.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.445
Okay. Nighty-night.

40:57.254 --> 41:00.519
I'm gonna tell you something.
This ain't no coincidence.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.991
I mean, this whole thing
has been planned and organized.

41:04.094 --> 41:07.962
I wouldn't be surprised
if the sumbitch Was pre-medicated.

41:08.065 --> 41:09.896
- What are you saying?
- The crimes.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.060
I mean, it's the same mojo apperandi.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.138
Evidently, somebody's got a grudge

41:15.239 --> 41:18.208
against high-class,
hoity-toity restaurants.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.142
Like a pressure group of angry vegans?
Or maybe it's PETA.

41:21.245 --> 41:24.180
Damn it, Butlin, you mean to tell me
you knoW the name of the guy

41:24.281 --> 41:25.976
and you haven't even told anybody?

41:26.383 --> 41:28.442
It's People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

41:29.119 --> 41:31.314
You're talking crazy talk now.

41:31.856 --> 41:36.293
I tell you what, We get a reservation list
from all the poisoned restaurants,

41:36.393 --> 41:38.054
We'll find our poisoner.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.457
That's certainly one way to go,
but We do need a backup plan.

41:41.565 --> 41:45.524
A backup plan?
Butlin, let me ask you something.

41:45.636 --> 41:48.799
Did Patton need a backup plan
at Gettysburg?

41:48.906 --> 41:49.964
Oh, God.

41:50.074 --> 41:52.008
Did what-you-call-her
have a backup plan

41:52.109 --> 41:54.805
doWn there at Custard's Last Stand
with the Mexican?

41:55.579 --> 41:58.571
Or better yet, did my friend Donnie
have a backup plan

41:58.682 --> 42:02.015
When he shaved his pubes
with a rusty kitchen knife?

42:02.119 --> 42:04.349
Okay, no backup plan.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.051
Glad we understand each other.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.957
Okay, there you are.
Our entire database at your disposal.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.433
Database. Right.

42:18.269 --> 42:22.137
And my last month's reservations
are in a separate folder.

42:22.473 --> 42:25.101
- Oh, cool, you got a folder.
- Yeah.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.803
Right. Now, look,
I'll leave you here to your investigation.

42:27.912 --> 42:30.346
I've got an appointment
with my crab supplier.

42:30.447 --> 42:32.574
Yeah, I had an appointment With mine
a couple Weeks ago.

42:32.683 --> 42:34.548
She denied everything.

42:38.522 --> 42:40.422
I ought to be on Leno.

42:59.677 --> 43:00.735
What the hell?

43:05.616 --> 43:07.743
"Them handcuffs left a mark!"

43:08.652 --> 43:09.846
Well, now.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.685
What in tarnation?

43:18.896 --> 43:20.557
Get a good look?

43:21.932 --> 43:24.332
Mom, I didn't knoW you was here this...

43:26.370 --> 43:28.270
I work here, all right?

43:28.372 --> 43:31.068
I'm with the Health Department.
That's my badge right there.

43:31.175 --> 43:35.111
Yeah? All right.
Maybe you are who you say you are.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.438
And maybe you are who you said you...

43:40.050 --> 43:42.314
What the hell are you, exactly?

43:43.253 --> 43:47.349
I make sure
Micelli's is free of undesirables.

43:48.492 --> 43:50.892
We have a lot in common, then.
Let me ask you something.

43:50.995 --> 43:54.522
What do you find is the best way
to get rid of rat turds?

43:54.632 --> 43:56.497
Take a walk, crumb cop.

44:03.574 --> 44:05.303
She was so ugly,

44:05.409 --> 44:07.969
she could have trick-or-treated
over the telephone.

44:08.078 --> 44:11.104
I wasn't scared of her, though.
I was scared for her.

44:12.549 --> 44:14.881
If she'd set me off,
I'd have come doWn on her

44:14.985 --> 44:19.354
with one of them pile drivers, and then...
Nailed a bionic elbow on her.

44:20.190 --> 44:21.487
What's a bionic elbow?

44:21.592 --> 44:25.028
Oh, for Pete's sake,
don't tell me you don't watch wrestling.

44:25.562 --> 44:26.790
Not so much.

44:26.897 --> 44:29.764
Dadgum it, Butlin,
what kind of man are you?

44:31.101 --> 44:33.569
I was unable to find any matches
between the reservation lists

44:33.671 --> 44:35.138
at Clarito's and Les Deux Coquilles,

44:35.239 --> 44:37.104
and you couldn't find anything
at Micelli's.

44:37.207 --> 44:39.198
Oh, I found something, all right.

44:39.843 --> 44:44.212
Found out old Lily Micelli ain't as prim
and proper as she makes out.

44:45.115 --> 44:48.243
Yep, she's a regular Girls Gone Wild

44:48.352 --> 44:50.183
with them dirty e-mail.

44:51.355 --> 44:53.949
- How does that help us?
- I don't know hoW it helps you,

44:54.058 --> 44:58.017
but it helps me in my decision
on getting one of them computers.

45:04.601 --> 45:07.536
Larry's the name,
health inspecting's the game.

45:08.005 --> 45:10.473
No. Are you serious?

45:10.574 --> 45:12.906
Don't touch nothing. I'll be right there.

45:28.892 --> 45:32.259
Hold on, Butlin,
make sure We got the right address.

45:32.362 --> 45:34.387
Are you kidding me?

45:34.798 --> 45:36.493
Now, Gaz, there's really nothing wrong.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.467
- So a few people got sick.
- Just a few.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.504
All right, all right,
so maybe some people vomited

45:41.605 --> 45:42.594
- in the parking lot.
- "Vomited"!

45:42.706 --> 45:43.764
Maybe there was something wrong

45:43.874 --> 45:45.739
with the way the food was prepared
this evening.

45:45.843 --> 45:48.403
Sod this for a game of soldiers.
I'm slinging me hook!

45:48.512 --> 45:49.774
Now, Gaz, please.

45:49.880 --> 45:52.280
Now, the All City
is just around the corner.

45:52.382 --> 45:54.373
We went to great expense
to bring you here.

45:54.485 --> 45:55.452
Butlin?

45:56.186 --> 45:58.814
Looks like a casting call
for Zorro, the Gay Blade in here.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.446
- Let's get out of here.
- I don't give a toss

46:00.557 --> 46:02.760
about your poxy chef contest.

46:02.760 --> 46:03.351
About your poxy chef contest.

46:03.460 --> 46:04.893
- Well, yes, it's a very...
- Just sod off!

46:04.995 --> 46:07.486
Think my buddy Big Shug
is gonna love this.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.566
I cannot wait to call him.

46:09.666 --> 46:13.329
These fancy restaurants
is dropping like flies.

46:16.640 --> 46:17.868
Big Shug.

46:19.176 --> 46:21.007
Who now has a chance
at winning the All City,

46:21.111 --> 46:22.772
now that all the competition
has fallen victim

46:22.880 --> 46:24.905
to mysterious outbreaks
of food poisoning.

46:25.015 --> 46:28.678
Butlin, don't you even say
what I think you're fixing to say.

46:28.786 --> 46:32.017
- Oh, the motive's right there.
- What, a pepper shaker?

46:32.422 --> 46:34.856
It's right in front of your face,
and you don't wanna see it.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.017
You wanna close your eyes
and pretend it's not happening.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.389
That's what she said.

46:38.495 --> 46:42.727
You think Big Shug can't possibly
be guilty because he's a friend of yours.

46:47.571 --> 46:50.972
- You know how I spend my days?
- Not at the gay bar, that's for sure.

46:51.074 --> 46:53.065
I spend them
reassuring the people of this city

46:53.177 --> 46:56.374
that the outbreak of poisonings
is under control.

46:56.780 --> 46:58.839
That the department's on top of it.

46:58.949 --> 47:00.314
That people don't have to Worry

47:00.417 --> 47:02.977
When they go out to eat
at their favorite restaurants.

47:03.086 --> 47:05.953
Sir, We had a lead that we were
pursuing vigorously. Unfortunately...

47:06.056 --> 47:07.489
Quiet, Butlin!

47:08.292 --> 47:10.157
The only reason you're on this case

47:10.260 --> 47:13.229
is to help me
get this gun-toting redneck fired.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.696
"Gun-toting"?
wait a second, I ain't got guns no more.

47:15.799 --> 47:17.926
I got rid of them
when Donnie broke into my truck

47:18.035 --> 47:21.801
- and shot himself in the nuts.
- Donnie? Who the hell is Donnie?

47:21.905 --> 47:23.964
He's my semi-retarded neighbor.

47:24.842 --> 47:28.608
However, he might be full-bloWed
retarded. I ain't figured it out yet.

47:28.712 --> 47:30.373
He's a good kid, though.

47:30.480 --> 47:33.176
You knoW, I hear tell he just got a job
down there at the theaters,

47:33.283 --> 47:35.717
ripping tickets and sWeeping floors
and whatnot.

47:35.819 --> 47:38.947
- He's doing pretty...
- Shut up.

47:40.157 --> 47:43.456
The city attorney tells me
you're one legitimate infraction away

47:43.560 --> 47:46.085
from having your ass tossed out
on the street.

47:46.196 --> 47:50.360
I want you to go out there
and bring me back results

47:50.467 --> 47:53.231
Without breaking any rules,
or you're done.

47:53.337 --> 47:56.966
End of story. End of Larry.

47:59.343 --> 48:03.302
Using all my years of experience
on the health beat

48:03.413 --> 48:07.372
and my intuition and ability
to follow the thought processes

48:07.484 --> 48:09.577
of the criminal mind,

48:09.686 --> 48:12.814
I Will now point to the next restaurant

48:12.923 --> 48:15.050
on the poisoner's list.

48:21.064 --> 48:24.864
So we go and tell the oWners
of the Office Kingdom

48:24.968 --> 48:26.868
that a brilliant mixture
of science and mathematics

48:26.970 --> 48:29.268
has determined
they're the next likely victims?

48:32.476 --> 48:36.071
- We go and tell the Fatted Calf.
- That's it, the Fatted Calf.

48:36.179 --> 48:39.046
But We don't.
We get an undercover agent to do it.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.146
That's a great idea.

48:42.119 --> 48:43.484
I'll do it.

48:46.256 --> 48:49.191
Butlin? Listen, I don't knoW
how to tell you this, all right?

48:49.293 --> 48:53.252
So I'm just gonna come out and say it.
You're not exactly undercover material.

48:53.363 --> 48:54.762
At least, yet.

48:56.333 --> 48:58.893
Butlin, imagine, if you Will,

48:59.002 --> 49:02.096
We're in one of the nicest restaurants
in the city right here.

49:02.205 --> 49:06.733
For sake of argument,
let's call it Le Larry.

49:10.347 --> 49:13.373
Hello, welcome to Le Larry.
I'm Amelia, your server.

49:14.551 --> 49:17.111
May I interest you two in a selection
from our wine cellar?

49:17.220 --> 49:19.484
The '91 cabernet sauvignon
would be great.

49:19.589 --> 49:22.057
- Good choice.
- Hey, Larry!

49:22.893 --> 49:25.794
- Do you want to play?
- I can't right now, Donnie. I'm working.

49:25.896 --> 49:27.329
Let's play!

49:27.798 --> 49:30.596
- Oh, my God! Is he okay?
- I'm okay!

49:30.701 --> 49:32.225
Attaboy, Donnie!

49:32.336 --> 49:34.861
Yeah, don't worry about him.
He does that all the time.

49:34.972 --> 49:38.305
Oh, remember when he... He got
in this fart contest a long time ago,

49:38.408 --> 49:41.434
and they was... He was farting
a song, Jimmy Crack Corn,

49:41.545 --> 49:42.512
and he got a little...

49:42.646 --> 49:44.739
Larry, can we get back on point here,
please? Thank you.

49:44.848 --> 49:45.815
Oh. Sure.

49:46.817 --> 49:49.843
Well, look at the little feller
we got waitressing on us.

49:50.253 --> 49:53.017
Hey, little feller.
Why don't you run and get us

49:53.123 --> 49:55.648
one of them nice Boone's Farm Wines?

49:55.759 --> 49:58.455
It don't matter what flavor.
We're not picky here at this table.

49:58.562 --> 50:00.029
This is the stupidest thing I've ever...

50:00.130 --> 50:03.429
Le Larry is a classy place, okay?
We don't serve Boone Farm.

50:03.533 --> 50:04.659
Damn it, Butlin.

50:04.768 --> 50:07.259
People been drinking
Boone's Farm Wine in this country

50:07.371 --> 50:11.467
ever since the Lord cometh over here
on the Mayflower over 100 years ago.

50:11.575 --> 50:14.806
Jane, I'm sorry you had to get involved
in this gigantic waste of time.

50:14.911 --> 50:16.776
Larry, I have a case to work.

50:19.583 --> 50:21.517
Come on, she Was trying.

50:23.086 --> 50:25.020
Butlin. Butlin!

50:25.822 --> 50:27.221
- What?
- I wanna tell you something.

50:27.891 --> 50:30.689
You're raW. You is raW.

50:30.961 --> 50:33.555
But you know what you got? Balls.

50:33.663 --> 50:37.326
You got balls, and that's what it takes
to be a health inspector.

50:37.434 --> 50:39.698
- Thanks, Larry.
- Damn right.

50:39.803 --> 50:44.740
Butlin, I bequeath to you
this microphone cord and earplug

50:44.841 --> 50:48.572
so you can go undercover
in the Health Department.

50:53.583 --> 50:57.781
Test 2. Roger 9 to Butlin.
Butlin, is this on? Can you hear me?

50:58.321 --> 50:59.481
Butlin.

51:00.157 --> 51:02.455
Butlin, turn your microphone on!

51:03.827 --> 51:06.318
- Testing, testing.
- All right, Butlin, listen,

51:06.430 --> 51:09.558
you need to be a chameleon. Blend in.

51:09.666 --> 51:11.998
Okay. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry about that.

51:12.102 --> 51:15.071
One thing you do not want to do
is stand out.

51:15.172 --> 51:16.139
Oh, God!

51:16.773 --> 51:19.537
- Sorry.
- Butlin, good Lord, what happened?

51:20.377 --> 51:23.073
Sounds like you're a bull
in a Chinaman's shop in there.

51:23.180 --> 51:26.115
I had front-row tickets to Nugent,
and he wasn't as loud as you.

51:26.216 --> 51:27.513
Shut up, Larry.

51:30.887 --> 51:32.252
Hello, sir.

51:33.223 --> 51:36.954
For tonight's specials,
We have sautéed trenne

51:37.427 --> 51:41.955
with beef Bolognese,
peacock kale and parmesan.

51:42.566 --> 51:46.195
Butlin, it's not Bolognese, it's bologna.

51:47.137 --> 51:51.096
I understand you have
a particularly impressive squab.

51:51.842 --> 51:54.572
Hey, Butlin,
he's checking out your package.

51:54.678 --> 51:56.805
What did you do ?
Get a chubby when you went in there ?

51:56.913 --> 51:58.813
Think about... Think about baseball.

51:59.716 --> 52:02.685
Can't believe you're the only feller
who'd get a chubby on an undercover.

52:02.786 --> 52:05.516
Damn it, I am a woman.

52:06.123 --> 52:08.091
I have breasts.

52:08.191 --> 52:11.126
They may not be especially large,
but they're perky,

52:11.228 --> 52:13.219
and my nipples could cut glass!

52:14.231 --> 52:16.199
What? No, no, no.

52:18.869 --> 52:20.837
Oh, Mayor Gunn.

52:22.038 --> 52:23.903
Don't beat yourself up, Butlin.

52:24.007 --> 52:26.567
Undercover ain't something
you master overnight.

52:26.676 --> 52:28.974
I remember one time
they sent me down there to Hooters

52:29.079 --> 52:31.639
and had me acting
like a drunken, loud-mouthed slob...

52:31.748 --> 52:34.080
- Larry, the Mayor's here.
- Where?

52:34.184 --> 52:35.981
He just walked into the kitchen
with Chef Leon.

52:36.153 --> 52:39.418
Butlin, Wake up and smell the cat box,
for God's sake!

52:39.523 --> 52:42.890
- What are you talking about ?
- The Mayor! Don't you get it ?

52:42.993 --> 52:44.620
Now he can see us at work.

52:44.728 --> 52:47.094
Only we're gonna get a big promotion
for this.

52:47.430 --> 52:50.957
- Monsieur, I cannot do this.
- Oh, of course you can.

52:51.067 --> 52:52.932
It's just a little sprinkle here.

52:53.036 --> 52:57.200
You're asking me to poison the food
that I took so long to prepare?

52:57.307 --> 52:59.036
Oh, no, no, no, Chef.
Not at all, not at all.

52:59.142 --> 53:02.202
If I do this, no one must ever know.

53:05.315 --> 53:06.646
Thank you.

53:09.853 --> 53:11.582
Larry, did you hear that?

53:14.691 --> 53:17.455
Larry! Larry!

53:17.561 --> 53:21.930
Excuse me. were you eavesdropping
on my conversation?

53:23.166 --> 53:25.066
- No.
- Are you with the press?

53:25.168 --> 53:26.135
No!

53:27.137 --> 53:30.368
Sodomite! Sodomite!

53:30.473 --> 53:32.964
You have brought shame to our family.

53:33.076 --> 53:35.704
Flaunting yourself
in front of the imperialist sWine,

53:35.812 --> 53:38.440
leaving me to do nothing
but fend for myself at the house

53:38.548 --> 53:40.345
with nothing but a goat for company.

53:42.786 --> 53:44.413
- You heard all that, right?
- Oh, I heard.

53:44.521 --> 53:45.783
- You got it all on tape, right?
- I got it.

53:45.889 --> 53:49.450
- So what are we gonna do?
- Oh, we're gonna nail the Mayor.

53:49.559 --> 53:53.791
He is going doWn faster than a bottle
of Vicodin at Courtney Love's house.

54:34.604 --> 54:38.665
I have died and gone to Larry heaven!

54:40.277 --> 54:42.745
Look at that 10-point buck!

54:43.280 --> 54:44.941
Congratulations, son.

54:45.048 --> 54:48.347
I'd pat you on the back,
but you shot me in the neck.

54:48.451 --> 54:51.113
A talking buck?
I ain't never seen nothing like that.

54:52.289 --> 54:53.756
I even got my oWn jukebox.

54:54.257 --> 54:55.884
Gonna play me a song.

55:04.100 --> 55:06.330
Hot damn! Kid Rock!

55:06.736 --> 55:09.762
I got the boat full of gas,
cooler full of beer.

55:09.873 --> 55:11.568
Let's go kick some bass.

55:13.043 --> 55:15.511
Good Lord, the Virgin Mary
and a grilled cheese sandwich.

55:15.612 --> 55:17.546
I'm going fishing with Kid Rock.

55:17.647 --> 55:21.310
Hey, Larry, sure you don't wanna
catch something a little hotter?

55:21.785 --> 55:25.084
- Jane?
- Nice rod.

55:27.057 --> 55:28.547
She said rod.

55:29.492 --> 55:31.255
Got a major dilemma here.

55:31.695 --> 55:34.357
One hand,
Kid Rock wants to take me fishing.

55:34.464 --> 55:37.194
But on the other hand,
I got Jane, who's a girl,

55:37.300 --> 55:41.327
and apparently wants to get naked
with me in a biblical Way.

55:43.506 --> 55:44.837
Don't know what to do.

55:45.075 --> 55:47.043
Gonna have to make this decision
on your oWn.

55:47.143 --> 55:49.737
Come on, Larry. What are you, queer ?

55:50.246 --> 55:53.340
- The deer makes a good point.
- He does at that.

55:54.250 --> 55:55.979
- Come on, dear.
- Yes!

55:56.086 --> 55:58.281
Not you. You.

56:16.906 --> 56:20.103
Man, this is gonna be a good day.

56:22.545 --> 56:24.877
I'm just saying
there's a case for exercising caution.

56:24.981 --> 56:26.005
And I'm saying

56:26.116 --> 56:28.607
there's a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon
right back there in the back

56:28.718 --> 56:31.243
that I'm gonna open up
when we put the Mayor away.

56:31.354 --> 56:33.288
And you knoW what?
You can't have any of it

56:33.390 --> 56:36.154
if you keep talking
about gathering more evidence.

56:36.259 --> 56:37.351
I just think that...

56:37.460 --> 56:39.052
Here's what you need
to be thinking about.

56:39.162 --> 56:41.858
You need to be thinking about
a cool little catchphrase to say

56:41.965 --> 56:44.593
- When We get him.
- What do you mean?

56:44.701 --> 56:46.191
Well,
you gotta have a cool catchphrase.

56:46.302 --> 56:47.963
I mean, it's in the rule book.

56:48.071 --> 56:51.302
Like that time
I busted that chef at the Golden Goose

56:51.408 --> 56:55.367
for dealing drugs in the kitchen.
I said, "Your goose is cooked."

56:56.279 --> 56:58.247
So what do we say to the Mayor?

56:58.681 --> 57:02.117
"We're from the Health Department,
and we'd like to talk to you."

57:02.218 --> 57:05.381
Tell you what, Butlin,
I'll handle the catchphrase.

57:06.423 --> 57:09.392
How do you answer charges
that you've been an ineffective mayor,

57:09.492 --> 57:11.687
that you've mainly devoted yourself
to finding ways

57:11.795 --> 57:13.854
to contribute to your own bank account?

57:13.963 --> 57:17.364
Well, everyone knows that
I'm a tireless campaigner for this city.

57:18.034 --> 57:20.127
The people,
they know what kind of man I am.

57:20.236 --> 57:21.225
Health Department!

57:21.337 --> 57:23.703
- Sir, I tried to tell them...
- It's okay. I knoW these people.

57:23.807 --> 57:26.037
Anything I could do
to help the Health Department.

57:26.142 --> 57:27.507
- Let's get a picture.
- Picture?

57:27.610 --> 57:29.407
You poisoned all them restaurants.

57:29.512 --> 57:30.536
You know what you is?

57:30.647 --> 57:34.139
You're a damn
restaurant-poisoning mayor.

57:34.951 --> 57:37.419
We have evidence that you're behind
the incidents at Les Deux Coquilles,

57:37.520 --> 57:39.147
Clarito's, Bottle and Micelli's.

57:39.255 --> 57:41.189
Yeah, just what she said,
every one of them.

57:41.291 --> 57:43.623
Evidence? Incidents?
I don't know what you're talking about.

57:43.726 --> 57:45.091
Turn that thing off.

57:45.195 --> 57:47.095
Don't know what we's talking about."

57:47.497 --> 57:51.831
Maybe this little tape recorder I got
Will refresh your memory a little bit.

57:52.001 --> 57:55.437
Oh, Larry, right there.
Right there, that's perfect.

57:55.538 --> 57:57.096
You need it higher? I can go higher.

57:57.207 --> 58:00.108
Oh, damn. wrong side.

58:01.845 --> 58:04.473
- I cannot do this.
- Oh, of course you can.

58:04.581 --> 58:06.310
It's just a little sprinkle here.

58:06.416 --> 58:10.819
You're asking me to poison the food
that I took so long to prepare?

58:11.721 --> 58:14.246
Leaves a bad taste in your mouth,
don't it?

58:14.691 --> 58:15.919
Not as good as the Golden Goose,

58:16.025 --> 58:17.219
- but pretty good.
- That Was a good one.

58:17.327 --> 58:18.851
That was Chef Leon.

58:18.962 --> 58:23.228
I Was asking him to garnish my
chicken piccata with French's Mustard.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.494
But he's such a perfectionist,
he said no.

58:25.602 --> 58:28.400
He didn't wanna ruin his masterpiece.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.030
French's Mustard, chicken pickoters...

58:31.140 --> 58:33.768
You're a droWning man, Mayor Gunn.

58:33.877 --> 58:37.335
- DroWning man!
- Chef Leon, it's Mayor...

58:37.447 --> 58:40.143
Chef Leon, Larry. Health inspector.

58:40.917 --> 58:42.817
Yeah, I'm up here
with your partner-in-crime,

58:42.919 --> 58:45.649
soon-to-be ex-Mayor Gunn.

58:45.755 --> 58:50.419
He is singing like an autistic choirboy
at the American Idol.

58:50.627 --> 58:52.618
Told me the whole story.

58:53.029 --> 58:54.223
Yeah.

58:55.331 --> 58:57.094
Oh, really?

58:58.268 --> 59:01.931
So that French's Mustard
really tastes that good on it?

59:02.038 --> 59:04.666
No kidding. Yeah? No, no.

59:04.774 --> 59:07.174
No, I don't feel like an idiot at all.

59:07.777 --> 59:11.235
No, we're... No. Matter of fact,
I'm gonna run and get some.

59:11.347 --> 59:16.080
Oh, yeah, we was just talking about how
it tastes and stuff, good and all that.

59:16.185 --> 59:18.278
Yeah, to... I gotta go.

59:21.658 --> 59:23.626
This is hard to sWallow.

59:24.427 --> 59:27.123
Don't worry about it, Butlin.
we'll be all right.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.289
No, no, that Was my cool catchphrase.

59:29.399 --> 59:32.425
"It's hard to sWalloW."
SWalloWing is impeded.

59:32.535 --> 59:34.594
Chef Leon, it's Mayor...

59:35.338 --> 59:37.704
- Chef Leon, Larry. Health inspector.
- Cripe's sake.

59:37.807 --> 59:39.069
Nice work, Jane.

59:39.475 --> 59:42.672
This is the guy you Were thinking
about letting in your pants?

59:42.779 --> 59:45.646
Looks like he has trouble
getting into his oWn pants.

59:46.416 --> 59:48.407
Oh, my God!

59:49.018 --> 59:51.248
- Shut up already.
- Mom, enough!

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.349
Come here.

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:28.253
You accused the Mayor.
You had no evidence.

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:30.184
I had a gut feeling.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.657
Man, it might have been indigestion,
actually.

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.196
Well, you've been an embarrassment
to this department a long time,

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.665
- but now you're officially a liability.
- That's harsh.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:42.067
I wore the wire. It wasn't his fault.
I thought the Mayor was guilty, too.

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.195
This was your first assignment.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.900
You're only guilty
of secondhand stupidity.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:49.538
MoonPie ?

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:54.947
Can't believe I actually got fired.
That sumbitch.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:59.652
After all I've done for this company,
for them to go ahead...

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:04.016
Hey! What the...

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.456
Hey, that's my truck!

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.968
NoW it is officially a sucky day.

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:20.538
Whatever it is, it can't be so bad

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:23.510
a plate of chicken and waffles
can't make it go away.

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:25.376
You don't even know.

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:28.974
I even deep-fried the coleslaw
just the way you like it.

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:34.480
Man, Shug, I screwed up.
I lost my thing.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.080
Your virginity?

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.827
No, I lost that
when I Was horseback riding

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:40.623
When I Was 10.

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:46.099
No, I lost my nose for the truth.
That's what I did.

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.700
You knoW what,
you gonna laugh when I tell you this,

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.400
but I actually thought
at one point in time

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:56.376
that you Was the one behind all the
food poisonings at these restaurants.

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.910
I didn't say you did. I Was just...

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.213
You're gonna laugh about this
in the morning.

01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:09.956
What the hell?

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:43.620
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me,
Mr. Mayor. This is for you.

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:29.838
Hi, Larry.

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.533
Hey, Donnie! Thank the Lord.

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:35.134
Hey, you wanna play some ball?

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:42.675
You have misrepresented
a deeply-loved public official.

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:49.221
Dickweed.

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.656
Larry, it's Jane.

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:30.992
Larry?

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:34.498
Larry, open the door.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:37.835
What do you Want,
you backstabbing backstabber?

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.237
You're drunk.

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:42.436
Well, I may be drunk,

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.173
but in the morning I'll be sober.

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:49.051
And you'll be
a backstabbing backstabber.

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:52.382
But tomorrow, I'll still be drunk.

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:56.214
Hey, why don't you just go run over
to your buddy, the Mayor?

01:04:56.325 --> 01:05:00.091
Larry, open this door, or I'm gonna call
the police and have them break it doWn.

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.426
You ain't the first Woman
to make that threat.

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:06.490
However, you are the first one
to make that threat to get in here.

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:09.794
Get me the police.

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:11.768
Hello, police?

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:17.707
Hello? I'm standing outside

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:20.748
114 Sycamore Street.

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:31.883
Another lie.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:35.321
Boy, I tell you what,
lies just fall out of your mouth

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:39.925
like stuff that falls
out of people's mouths when they lie.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:44.437
Larry, What are you talking about?
I've never lied to you. Never.

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:49.540
You are so busted, Jane.

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:53.004
If that's even your real name, Jane.

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:57.512
I mean, I seen you canoodling
with the Mayor what's-his-toes.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.248
Oh, good... Do you even know
What canoodling means?

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:04.725
Yes, I do know. Canoodle. To canoodle.

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.658
- WoW.
- I don't know.

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:08.093
You are an idiot!

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:11.423
You knoW what?
I may be, but tomorrow...

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:13.434
You'll still be an idiot.

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:16.164
Amy called me.
She told me what happened.

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:18.263
She didn't believe
the Mayor wasn't involved,

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:20.968
so she asked me
to go on a date With him

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:24.808
to see if I could get him to do
or say anything incriminating, okay?

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:26.472
You get it, dumb ass?

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:29.449
Damn, girl, what got into you?

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:33.646
Why, you're more fired up
than Rosie O'Donnell at the titty bar.

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:36.782
I don't know.
Listen, listen, the Mayor gave me this.

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:40.089
He told me to expect
a hot personal message from him.

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:43.597
'Course, I gave bigballer23
a fake address.

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:47.328
- Who?
- Bigballer23.

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:50.331
That's His Honor's
super-secret address

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:54.500
for his super-secret little affairs
With super-stupid girls.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.805
Bigballer23.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.281
Larry!

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:09.014
Bigballer23.

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:13.862
NoW we're getting someWhere.

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:19.263
Well, I hope
you got good insurance, man.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:22.132
These punks sure did a number
on your truck.

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:23.569
Are you serious?

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.874
You know how much money
I put into that truck?

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:29.876
Unbelievable.

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:32.937
Are you kidding me?

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:36.448
SWeet! They didn't even touch it.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.179
Unbelievable.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:42.216
Hey, what are the odds of this?

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:45.555
Somebody steal your truck,
and it looks good as new.

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.288
It's unbelievable.

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.259
You know what that is?

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:54.097
That's a miracle
from the Lord Jesus himself.

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:57.263
I'm gonna start going to church
every Sunday 'cause of this.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.604
Except for next Sunday,
'cause I got a fishing tournament.

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.176
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:03.745
Oh, I got that kind of face.

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:06.872
People are always getting me confused
with guys that cheated on their wives

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:09.542
in the Port-O-Let at Daytona Beach
during the Budweiser Shootout

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:11.313
at about 4:00 in the afternoon...

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.480
No, no, I know where it is.
Micelli's. Yeah, that's it.

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.819
Yeah, my wife and I went there
the other day for dinner.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.919
Yeah, you were there. Couldn't get in.
The Mayor stood up for you.

01:08:21.162 --> 01:08:23.461
- That's cool.
- Yeah, I was up there at Micelli's.

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:26.535
Let me ask you this, hoW long
did it take you to hit the Mylanta bottle

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:28.125
after you got sick up there?

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:31.835
From the food.
After you got sick on the food.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.272
I didn't get sick.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:37.368
Yeah. We had friends join us later.
They didn't get sick, either.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.175
That's interesting.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:43.778
Mr. Mayor. Expecting somebody else?

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:46.877
Larry, this is ridiculous. Look around.

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.854
I got security men all over this park.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:53.417
One false move from you,
they'll be handcuffing you to the bench.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:56.225
Well, that'd give us something else
in common, wouldn't it,

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.857
bigballer23?

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.765
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:04.669
- Bet your wife would knoW.
- Please, don't upset my Wife.

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:07.564
Larry, is there anything
I could do for you?

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:11.073
I could use some free rental
on bowling shoes on Saturday.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.545
I could do that.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:15.116
What does that have to do
with you recommending me

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:17.447
for the fancy restaurant beat?

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:21.455
Yes, someone did recommend you,
but I had nothing to do With it.

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.046
Who did it?

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.990
No, no, careful With the shirt.
It's a Donald Trump.

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:26.185
Are you kidding me?

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:27.660
I didn't even know
he had his oWn collection.

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:31.198
Wait a minute. Who did it? Who did it?

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.837
Lily Micelli?

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.163
The oWner of the restaurant?

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:41.743
Yep.
Seems like the Mayor and the Mudcelli

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.005
Were making a little weenie linguini.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:47.908
And she asked him to recommend you
for the five-star restaurant beat?

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:51.509
That's right. Notice When I got the gig,
she stopped dilling his pickle.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.282
- "Dilling his pickle"?
- Look, I could do this all day.

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:58.451
But why would Lily Micelli
want the Mayor to put Larry on the job?

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:02.625
- Because she wanted a sucker.
- That's right.

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:06.098
And when she couldn't find one,
she got me.

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:11.404
Well, you Was half-right, Butlin.
Look at that!

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:15.605
You thought Big Shug was the one
knocking out all the competition.

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.337
Right idea. wrong poisoner.

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:23.011
- I always knew he was innocent.
- No, just wait.

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:26.246
Larry, when we ate at Micelli's,
we got sick, remember?

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:28.323
My mom
will still not go near that bathroom,

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:29.584
and she got it re-grouted.

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:33.161
That reminds me.
Tell your mom I need to go doWn there

01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:35.662
to housewares and pick her up
some new kitty cat dishtowels.

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.698
Larry, we need evidence.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.462
If I accuse someone else
and I'm wrong again, I might just...

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:45.268
End up like me.
Butlin, you have done a tremendous job.

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:46.966
And I don't need you
risking your neck no more.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.408
This is my problem.
I'm gonna clean it up.

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:50.478
How?

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.274
You can't go anywhere near Lily
or the All City

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:54.440
without Tatlock going ballistic.

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:56.074
we'll see about that.

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:03.156
The prize? $250,000.
But more than just money,

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:06.456
the All City is the Super Bowl
of cook-offs.

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:10.195
Once there were 10, now there are two.

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.961
A strange, controversial
series of events

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:16.196
has left us with
Big Shug's Tasty Chicken and Waffles

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.035
and Micelli's.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.476
classic David versus Goliath
showdown.

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:28.146
Judging tonight's event is the reigning
Miss Tri-County, Sung Yoo,

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:32.578
Channel 13 Food Critic Ted Baily,

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:36.249
and star of Leave It to Beaver,
Jerry Mathers.

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:41.990
And last, but certainly not least,
the finest mayor this city has ever had.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:43.792
Please, put your hands together

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:46.925
for the honorable Mayor,
Maurice T. Gunn!

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.663
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:58.343
On an undercover,
a feller can live or die

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:01.177
by the credibility of his disguise.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.712
What do you think, Schmoolie?

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.651
I kneW it. I look too much
like Russell Crowe, don't I?

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:16.230
Ms. Micelli, Mr. Shug,

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.197
you know what your mission is.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.536
To make a starter fit for a king
in three minutes.

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:25.600
Are you ready? Let's go!

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:31.604
And we're off. Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment we've all been waiting for.

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:35.741
It's uptown versus downtown,
the boxer versus the puncher,

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.786
high society versus high cholesterol.

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:41.648
Holy Coke nails, Batman!

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:47.086
Larry, how's it coming in there?

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.828
What do you think?
Think it makes me look fat?

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.798
You're under arrest.

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.894
You is under arrest for violations
of Code 9.

01:12:58.173 --> 01:12:59.731
Freeze, Mucelli!

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:06.010
No, you're right. I don't like it.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:12.179
Micelli, a vision of loveliness.
Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson."

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:14.679
Gotta tell you,
I'd eat Big Shug's underwear

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:18.317
if he dipped it in batter
and dropped it in some grease.

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.755
I don't know, Schmoolie.

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:25.429
I don't think they're gonna buy into
this ridiculous outfit, either.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:28.503
Hey.

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:34.400
Folks, you have to wonder,
how does Micelli stay so poised,

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:37.604
and where did Shug
find that much lime-green fabric ?

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.249
Be that as it may,
Round 1 has come to an end.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:45.252
The crowd is on the edge of their seats,
ripe with anticipation.

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:55.319
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.460
What's the over-under on that?

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:00.995
Okay, I'll take tWo dimes on Houston.

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:02.125
Okay!

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:05.568
Golly gee, that's pretty high.

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.166
Folks, you can cut the tension
with a knife.

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:13.677
Judges, have you reached a decision ?

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:16.382
The Beave
appears to be phoning this one in.

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:18.083
Yes, we have.

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:22.651
We award the starter round to
Big Shug's Tasty Chicken and waffles.

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:24.993
Down goes Micelli.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:29.257
Big Shug delivers a big upset,
and the crowd loves it.

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:31.457
Look at them.
They can't get enough of this guy.

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:33.467
Oh, that is a... That is quite a surprise.

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:35.628
Do you mind
if we get a picture together?

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:36.761
There you have it, folks.

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:39.340
Big Shug, clearly the underdog,
comes out swinging.

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:42.539
That's fantastic. That's just fantastic.

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:46.938
You looking at my breasteses?

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:52.518
Let's have a big hand for Big Shug,

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:55.647
clearly the dark horse
of this event so far!

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.384
Clearly

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.393
the underdog, the winner!

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:00.894
Let's go on to the next round...

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:04.056
If we don't win the next round,

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:08.859
you're all going to be getting
phone calls from the INS tomorroW.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:13.033
- I Was born here.
- That's what you think.

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.833
Oh, God, I hate the chicken man.

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.903
The chicken man, the chicken man.

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:44.495
He can't win because he's a joke.
He's here because he's a joke.

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:46.870
That's why he's winning.

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:51.173
Because you got lazy.
You got complacent.

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:55.811
Oh, shut up, uni-brow!

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:59.986
Now, look, I've gotten rid of the rest
of the competition here.

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:03.319
I can certainly get rid
of Chicken Not-so-little.

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.454
No, no, no. Look,

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:08.359
we know that whatever they give him
to cook, he's gonna deep-fry.

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:12.923
So what we'll do is We'll just drop
a little emetic in his grease, right?

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:14.468
And it's game over.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:20.297
Larry.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:21.876
Oh, damn.

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:24.711
Larry?

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.372
This is hard to swallow.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.952
Good catchphrase. No?

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:40.027
Freeze! Health Department.

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.390
Freeze! Health Department.

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:51.836
- You're going doWn, you piece of crap.
- Not me, I'm a floater!

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.844
Say so long to the toilet.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:04.108
Do you know what this is?

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:09.455
80 cc's of ipecac
in a Bolton-Serta model 25A

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:12.254
- plastic disposable syringe?
- No.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:15.194
It's the same poison I used
to ruin the reputation

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:18.198
of every four-star restaurant
in this toWn.

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:21.596
And now it's gonna go
straight up your ass.

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:35.984
Eat it!

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:38.086
Eat it!

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:55.859
It's okay, it's okay. I got you.

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.802
It's okay, it's okay. I got you.

01:17:57.906 --> 01:18:00.932
Okay, all right, happy thoughts.
Happy thoughts.

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:11.314
Do you like that, huh?
Take that. Take that one, too!

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.615
Don't mess with Hasidic Larry.

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:15.987
Oh, I think I hurt my nuts.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:21.121
Anything you wanna say to me, boss?

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:25.325
- Or should I say confess?
- Confess?

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.829
Are you out of your...

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:30.404
You was in on this thing
all from the beginning.

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:33.406
When I shoWed up there at Micelli's,
you had her give me the squirts.

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:37.444
That ain't very Christian, especially on
a night when I was fixing to get some.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.673
On a first date? I don't think so.

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:42.017
Yeah, but you never heard me
do my song.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:46.313
Turns out me and Jane
was the only ones that got sick up there.

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:51.381
And it turns out
they's only one person, uno persono,

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:55.390
that told Jack Dabbs
to send me doWn there to Micelli's,

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:56.828
and that was you.

01:18:57.799 --> 01:18:59.528
That's right. That was you.

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:01.436
Hello?

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:03.271
Hello?

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:05.739
Larry. Larry!

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.632
Get... No, get doWn. Larry! Larry!

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:11.312
It was Jack! Jack! He's right there.

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:13.781
Oh, my God.

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:15.516
Oh, God.

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:19.149
It's a miracle! Praise the Lord!

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:20.812
Larry, he was never really handicapped.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:23.948
Butlin, why do you gotta be
such a dadgum atheist?

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:28.428
I mean, here you have a feller
that rosed up out of a wheelchair.

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:34.094
You bring shame on all of us!

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:39.730
Hey, stop that wannabe cripple!

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:49.613
Just try it, you non-crippled prick.

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:56.952
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:04.827
Dickweed.

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.400
Oh, crap.

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:13.133
Attaboy, Donnie!

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.143
Dickweed!

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:24.884
Well, Butlin,
we knoWed Lily had an ugly sister,

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:29.685
but who'd have thunk she had
an un-crippled nepheW, Jack Dabbs.

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.553
The Adam's apple?

01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:35.996
- You hit me in the Adam's apple?
- It hurt, don't it?

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:37.724
My granddaddy taught me that.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:41.291
You caused this department
a lot of embarrassment, Larry.

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:42.961
But you saved it some, too.

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:46.131
Well, I guess
that makes us about even right there.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.543
Now we're even.

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.510
Does that mean...

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:58.414
Does that mean that I get my job back?

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:02.883
Well, look, I... We'll act like
the past few weeks never happened.

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:05.016
One more thing, though. A promotion.

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.991
Don't push your luck, pal.

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:09.427
Not for me, for the... For the girl.

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:13.699
Hey, man, you told me she Was a he.

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:17.169
Listen, I'm not asking for a raise
or a bigger office or nothing.

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.934
All's I want's a little respect
every now and then.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:23.670
And when I say, "every now and then,"
I mean now.

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:31.180
You did a good job today.

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.744
Thank you.

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:36.289
Don't you have a gay parade to get to?

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:39.925
I'm just kidding.
I know you ain't a flipper.

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:44.030
- So what happens next?
- Well,

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:45.724
I figured on Monday
we'd head doWn there

01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:48.234
to Sakamoto's joint
and give him a hard time.

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.769
He loves that.

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:52.965
Then let's go to the Greek restaurant,
check for eyebrow hair in the...

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:55.065
- You're back.
...gyros. Oh, hey.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.075
I don't hug dudes.

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:02.147
- See you on Monday, partner.
- See you Monday, partner.

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:11.886
So what was it that you said
about a song?

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:14.962
Oh. Yeah, a song.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:18.392
If we get into it, there ain't no...
You know, this'll be it.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.162
I'm gonna sing it,
and you'll be putty in my hands.

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.931
Okay. Come on.

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.107
Oh, man.

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:29.303
All right, that's what you wanna do,

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.902
is singing songs, I guess We'll do it.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:36.174
I'm gonna sing it now.

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.616
The song that we've been waiting for.
I'm gonna...

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:53.429
Hello?

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.301
No.

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:58.732
I'm gonna be down there.
Don't touch nothing.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.102
Bye.

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:02.373
Trouble at the Golden Goose.

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:04.707
Oh, but, Larry,
we were having such a good time.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:09.113
I know, Jane, and I wanna stay.
But let me explain something to you.

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:13.153
This World is full of molds
and creepy-crawlies

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:14.619
and mildews.

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:17.419
And damn it, Jane,
I'm the health inspector.

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:20.494
Okay. But when you come back...

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:30.564
Oh, damn. Now, that sounded dirty.

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.330
Git-R-Done !

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:39.213
- Who are you talking to?
- All the people out there.

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.248
Hi, people. Say, "Git-R-Done!"

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:43.817
- I don't see any people.
- Just say it, right there.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.785
Git-R-Done!

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:48.151
Oh, that turns me on. Git-R-Done!

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:51.118
Probably because they were afraid
that the sun on these rides

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:52.818
would be too strong,
and without the proper protection

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:54.485
I sometimes get these, like,
second-degree burns.

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:56.029
But you're here,
and you're here to protect me.

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.291
Oh, you knoW what?
Let's go do the other ride.

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:59.264
with the animals and the balloons,
where you pop the balloons,

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:00.800
and then you get a stuffed animal
of some sort.

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:02.199
And you can choose, actually,
what animal you want.

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:04.168
You can choose the animal you want.
I don't have to choose it.

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:05.671
I might wanna choose it,
because there's a tiger.

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:07.969
I've always wanted a tiger in my house.

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:11.642
- who are your girlfriends?
- Lizzie and Tina.

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:15.773
- Larry, can I have one of them?
- Sure. Come on in, Donnie.

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:19.815
- Can I have both of them?
- No. You're retarded.

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:22.355
Dude, you messing With my woman?

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:26.255
What's up With that?
That Jane, that's my woman.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.355
- I didn't know that.
- Damn right.

01:24:28.463 --> 01:24:30.260
- It's ridiculous.
- Why you didn't tell me?

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:32.731
You ever kiss a white boy?
Come on, kiss me.

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:35.530
Please don't worry.
It Was definitely not your fault.

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:37.832
I mean, I Was bound
to get fired from that job. I'm not...

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.839
- Larry, where have you been?
- Not really cut out for...

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:40.965
I've been looking all over for you.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.475
What the hell?

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:46.005
Well, douche me with dishwater.

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:48.639
Ain't this a turd in the punch bowl?

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:53.554
He said today that he wrote someone up
for a Richard Gere Offense

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:56.317
because his back door
wasn't rodent-proofed.

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:57.891
I do not recall
a Richard Gere Ordinance,

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.789
and I Was first in my class.

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:01.486
Check the archives.

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:04.326
Git-R-Done, Git-R-Done, Git-R-Done,
done, done.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.115
Say the line, mother... Say the line!

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:58.748
George, your mom got big boobs?

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:01.321
She sure does!

01:26:21.643 --> 01:26:22.667
Get her done.

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:25.539
I love it
When a girl says, "Git-R-Done."

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.880
The movie's over.
Y'all go and get some Milk Duds.
