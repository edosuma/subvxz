That's the sign of healthy food.

You think that's healthy,
try this.

02:55.510 --> 02:58.471

03:31.713 --> 03:34.465
Listen, pal, I'm looking
for a versatile smoke,

03:34.549 --> 03:36.718
one that's equally good
in a crowded elevator

03:36.801 --> 03:38.052
or an audience with the Pope.

03:38.511 --> 03:40.555
Forget the Pope,

03:40.638 --> 03:41.889
Smoke one of these,

03:41.973 --> 03:45.935
and God himself will ask to
be seated far away from you.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.395
Ooh!

03:48.146 --> 03:51.107
Heirloom eggs?
That's so life-affirming.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.568
I'll bet you run
your own hatchery,

03:53.651 --> 03:56.487
just you and your wife,
Matilda.

03:56.946 --> 04:00.074
No, ma'am. Matilda and I gather
them eggs in the forest.

04:00.158 --> 04:02.618
And Matilda's really more
of a mongoose than a wife.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.036
You're a lucky man.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.539
But are they way more
expensive than regular eggs?

04:06.873 --> 04:08.833
Way more.
Ooh!

04:08.916 --> 04:09.917
I'll take a dozen.

04:18.968 --> 04:22.388
You're not my breakfast friends.

eating healthy, organic food.

she have on you?

04:28.811 --> 04:31.272

her filthy scrambled eggs,

04:31.355 --> 04:32.523
you'll never find out.

04:32.732 --> 04:34.150
They're not filthy.

04:34.233 --> 04:38.154
They're wholesome, fertile and
fresh from the forest floor.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.363
There's some filth.

04:40.198 --> 04:41.866
"Fertile?"
What does that mean?

04:41.949 --> 04:45.912
It means it will hatch into a
tiny, little, infant creature

04:45.995 --> 04:47.371
unless we cook it first.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.082
Hey, Leela, hurry up with
those scrambled infants.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.251
What? That's horrifying!

04:52.376 --> 04:54.670

Oh, no, you won't! I refuse
to eat an unborn animal.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.892
I'm going to keep this egg
safe and warm and secure

05:07.975 --> 05:10.144
until it hatches
out into the world.

05:10.228 --> 05:11.687

was a vegetarian,

the sheep myself.
