00:03.625 --> 00:05.041
Ooh, our commercial is on!

00:05.125 --> 00:10.667
<i>Hello, I'm Rudy Gillespie,
the sensei of the Bobby Wasabi Dojo.</i>

00:10.750 --> 00:14.792
Oh, no, some bully
just stole my calculator.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.417
I wish I knew karate.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.959
I'll teach you.

00:19.959 --> 00:22.041
Thank you, handsome sensei.

00:23.375 --> 00:26.083
Hey, you, give me my calculator back.

00:28.792 --> 00:29.792
Oh, no.

00:29.875 --> 00:33.875
You must have learned karate
at the Bobby Wasabi Dojo,

00:33.959 --> 00:39.291
conveniently located at 3316 Ma...

00:39.375 --> 00:40.750
...Main Street.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.917
Hey, I was watching you from over...

00:48.417 --> 00:49.542
there.

00:50.375 --> 00:53.166
What do you call those
moves you do so well?

00:53.709 --> 00:55.667
They are called karate, friend.

00:55.917 --> 00:59.917
Because life without it...
just doesn't add up.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.333
Wow, you wear karate well.

01:02.417 --> 01:04.917
- Can I please be your girlfriend now?
-

01:06.417 --> 01:07.625
Sign up today!

01:07.709 --> 01:10.959
Call 1-5-5-5-0-1-ya!

01:11.041 --> 01:12.667
Oh, yeah!

01:12.750 --> 01:16.667
See, now everyone in Seaford will know
that I'm the King of Karate.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.917
Uh, Rudy, you may want to see this.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.500
<i>I'm Chuck Banner, the Karate King!</i>

01:21.583 --> 01:22.750
<i>And if you love America,</i>

01:22.834 --> 01:26.000
<i>you'll sign up at my
new Seaford Karate King Dojo today!</i>

01:26.083 --> 01:28.375
<i>Hiyah! Call within the next 30 minutes</i>

01:28.375 --> 01:31.333
<i>and you'll receive
this free Karate King clock.</i>

01:32.250 --> 01:35.166
<i>Men and ladies love waking up next to me.</i>

01:35.250 --> 01:36.500
<i>What time is it?</i>

01:36.875 --> 01:38.834
- <i>Half past awesome.</i>
-

01:41.458 --> 01:43.709
- Jerry, what are you doing?
- I'm getting that clock.

01:44.375 --> 01:45.709
I want one too.

01:46.709 --> 01:49.834
Please, guys, Chuck Banner is a joke.

01:49.917 --> 01:51.166
Jack is right.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.917
Nobody is calling Karate King
from my dojo!

01:54.000 --> 01:56.250
- But--
- You guys go stretch out. Get to work.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.166
- Oh, Rudy.
- All right.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.166
Fine.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.208
Yes, hello.

02:01.291 --> 02:03.792
Can I order one of those
free Chuck Banner Clocks?

02:04.125 --> 02:07.959
Wait, what? Ninety-nine dollars
for shipping and handling?

02:08.959 --> 02:10.041
I'll take two!

02:12.166 --> 02:15.333

02:54.500 --> 02:57.125
Hey, Rudy, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

02:57.208 --> 03:00.166
Hang on, I just have to finish
my Shin Do practice.

03:00.792 --> 03:01.792
Okay, I'm good.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.083
Check it out. The big sensei tournament

03:05.166 --> 03:06.709
is going to be
at the Seaford Civic Center.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.417
The final round is going to be televised.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.834
Oh.

03:09.917 --> 03:12.875
Winning this tournament in my hometown
would be even better publicity

03:12.959 --> 03:15.333
than when I became a hero
by jumping into the bay

03:15.417 --> 03:17.375
and saving that man in a wheelchair.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.208
He was only in the bay
because your car bumped into him--

03:20.291 --> 03:21.458
A hero!

03:23.667 --> 03:25.000
I was thinking that

03:25.917 --> 03:27.583
maybe I could enter the tournament.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.000
What?

03:29.083 --> 03:31.083
Jack, you're not a sensei.

03:31.166 --> 03:34.625
Rudy, I'm a second-degree black belt,
I win all of my tournaments,

03:34.709 --> 03:36.917
I really think I'm ready
to take the next step.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Jack, just because
you have a donkey in the barn

03:39.083 --> 03:40.750
doesn't mean you know how to plow a field.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.875
- What does that mean?
- No idea.

03:45.250 --> 03:48.792
Now the point is there's just
so much more I have to teach you.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.291
Do you want to learn
the ancient martial art

03:52.083 --> 03:53.250
of Shin Do?

03:53.333 --> 03:55.625
I Shin-don't.

03:56.709 --> 03:58.291
- It looks lame.
- Lame?

03:58.375 --> 04:00.959
You harness your opponent's energy
and use it against them.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.959
Rudy, why would I do that
when I can do this?

04:09.375 --> 04:12.375
Jack, there's more to being a sensei
than flying sidekicks.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.291
It requires a level of maturity
that you have yet to achieve.

04:15.375 --> 04:18.041
-
- Ooh! Ooh! They're here, they're here!

04:21.750 --> 04:25.208
-

04:25.250 --> 04:27.417
<i>It's time to kick butt! Hiyah!</i>

04:27.500 --> 04:32.417
Oh, Chuck Banner is a poser,
but this clock is "half past awesome"!

04:37.500 --> 04:39.750
All three of these foods are brown.

04:39.959 --> 04:41.709
How do I know which is which?

04:41.792 --> 04:44.125
The broccoli's got the congealed fat,

04:44.208 --> 04:46.166
the mac and cheese has got the mold,

04:46.250 --> 04:48.208
and the pot roast's
got the fat and the mold.

04:49.834 --> 04:52.542
Uh, look at Jerry's meatball.
It's like a rock.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.709
No, it's not.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.625
-
- You can eat a rock.

04:58.208 --> 04:59.750
You know what?
Something has got to be done

04:59.834 --> 05:02.125
about the food in the cafeteria.
I am sick of it.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.792
- Marge?
- You guys want seconds?

05:04.875 --> 05:06.458
No!

05:07.792 --> 05:09.542
Look, Marge,
there's no nice way to put this,

05:09.625 --> 05:11.041
so I'm just going to be blunt.

05:11.709 --> 05:14.959
Marge, your food stinks.

05:15.750 --> 05:19.125
There better be another woman named Marge
standing right behind me.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.500
We want better food!

05:22.583 --> 05:24.125
Hey, am I right, people?

05:24.208 --> 05:27.000
Better food! Better food!

05:27.083 --> 05:31.000
- Better food! Better food--
- Oh, that's it!

05:31.083 --> 05:34.875
You think it's easy putting
500 lukewarm meals out every day?

05:34.959 --> 05:38.375
Peeling onions, chopping carrots,
erasing expiration dates.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.250
You know what?
You guys don't appreciate me?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.750
I'm outta here. I'm removing my apron,

05:43.834 --> 05:46.667
my gloves, and my hairnet--
Where's my hairnet?

05:46.750 --> 05:47.917
Uh, where...

05:49.125 --> 05:50.166
It's in my soup.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.250
Gimme that!

05:53.375 --> 05:55.166
Come on, people, let's go.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.417
Hey, guys, you know what?

06:01.500 --> 06:02.417
With Marge gone,

06:02.500 --> 06:04.667
Principal Funderburk is gonna
have to find a new replacement.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.166
So trust me, this is gonna work out great.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.834
I can't believe
we're the new lunch ladies.

06:09.917 --> 06:11.792
I can't believe I have to wear a hairnet.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.542
I can't believe I have to wear three.

06:20.417 --> 06:23.250
Hey! I recognize you from your commercial.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.333
Oh! Thanks. You know, we're really proud--

06:25.417 --> 06:26.500
It was horrible.

06:27.875 --> 06:28.959
But you were good.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.625
Well, thank you.

06:30.709 --> 06:32.917
You're, uh, you're Chuck Banner,
the Karate King.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.250
How'd you know?

06:35.375 --> 06:36.542
Just a guess.

06:38.542 --> 06:41.834
Jack, you remind me of Young Me.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.208
I remind you of you?

06:43.291 --> 06:45.834
No, Young Me, the Chinese Grandmaster.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.667
He was a sensei at 16.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.417
Wait, really?

06:51.500 --> 06:53.917
Well, I'm 16, but I'm not a sensei.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.458
Well, you know what I say to that?
Boo hoo.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.125
You gonna cry?

06:58.208 --> 07:00.250
No. Boo Hoo, the black belt

07:01.291 --> 07:03.875
whose master never let him
become a sensei.

07:03.959 --> 07:06.625
You come over to Karate King
and I'll make you a sensei.

07:06.709 --> 07:10.125
And with that comes honor, prestige,
and ka-ching.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.250
Let me guess.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.250
Ka Ching is another sensei
who works for you?

07:13.333 --> 07:15.834
Ka-ching is an expression
for making a whole lot of money.

07:15.917 --> 07:16.959
What's wrong with you?

07:17.625 --> 07:18.625
What?

07:19.291 --> 07:21.166
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

07:21.709 --> 07:25.917
As you all know, they're holding
a sensei tournament right here in Seaford.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.542
And one student amongst you
has risen above all the others.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.125
I think someone's about
to become a sensei.

07:33.792 --> 07:36.875
- Jack, I would like to officially ask--
- Rudy, hang on one second.

07:36.959 --> 07:38.709
I'd like to say something first.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.041
Although I'm about to become a sensei,

07:43.125 --> 07:45.375
I will always be your friend-sei.

07:46.959 --> 07:48.458
Jack, I was gonna ask you

07:48.542 --> 07:50.417
if you'd be my cornerman
in the tournament.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.125
What?

07:52.208 --> 07:54.709
You want me to empty your spit bucket
and carry your shoes?

07:54.792 --> 07:57.959
Congratulations, friend-sei.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.667
Ooh!

08:04.709 --> 08:08.417
Ahh, Chicken Florentine
with mushroom risotto.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.875
Now that's a lunch.

08:09.959 --> 08:12.625
Great! We're just going to
need 499 more plates.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.000
What?

08:14.083 --> 08:16.375
It took me five hours to make this one!

08:16.458 --> 08:19.333
What? What are we gonna do?
We gotta feed them something.

08:21.083 --> 08:25.583
Who's ready to serve up
some famous Martinez gumbo ya-ya?

08:26.250 --> 08:28.625
I can't believe it!
This stuff smells so good.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.834
Jerry, you saved us!

08:29.917 --> 08:31.834
I didn't know you knew how to make gumbo.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.750
Ah, gumbo is just a Cajun word for...

08:33.834 --> 08:35.375
..."Throw it in there."

08:35.458 --> 08:39.458
Yeah, a little bullion, a little onion,
a little chick-on...

08:39.542 --> 08:40.917
...and some ketchup.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.208
Excuse me.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.709
Whatever is in that pot
just growled at me.

08:57.625 --> 08:59.417
This gumbo's fighting back.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.208
Ah, don't worry, I'll get it.

09:07.834 --> 09:11.333
Help! Ah, help!

09:11.417 --> 09:13.750
I'm in a bit of a situation.

09:13.834 --> 09:17.333
- Stop! Aah! Aah!
-

09:25.750 --> 09:27.709
Good, Jack, I'm glad you're here.

09:27.792 --> 09:30.375
Let's work on our spit bucket technique.

09:30.458 --> 09:32.125
If I get dazed out there,

09:32.208 --> 09:34.000
spit could be coming at you
from every angle.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.583
So, try to follow my mouth.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.500
I'm not gonna be your cornerman, Rudy.

09:38.583 --> 09:39.709
What do you mean

09:39.792 --> 09:41.125
you're not going to be my cornerman?

09:41.208 --> 09:42.750
I'm gonna be competing.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.792
What?

09:45.291 --> 09:46.875
You can't compete.

09:46.959 --> 09:48.208
It's only for senseis.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.250
I am a sensei.

09:50.208 --> 09:51.500
At Karate King.

09:51.709 --> 09:55.000
- You're a who at where now?
- I'll see you later, Rudy.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.250

09:56.667 --> 09:58.709
<i>It's time to kick butt! Hiyah!</i>

Everybody bow, it's sensei Jack.

10:31.417 --> 10:33.333
No, he's not a real sensei! Stop bowing!

10:34.000 --> 10:35.709
Well, Chuck Banner thinks I am.

10:35.792 --> 10:36.875
Oh, really?

10:36.959 --> 10:40.250
Um, was Chuck there
when you broke your first board?

10:40.375 --> 10:42.083
Or, or when you got your black belt?

10:42.166 --> 10:45.542
Or when you were so nervous
you wet your pants before Nationals?

10:45.625 --> 10:47.667
That wasn't me, Rudy. That was you.

10:47.750 --> 10:50.542
Stupid hotel with that
all-you-can-drink lemonade bar.

10:52.208 --> 10:54.041

10:54.125 --> 10:56.542
And I want you to become a sensei,
but when you're ready.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.208
Well, I think I'm ready now.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.125
Excuse me.
I have a tournament to sign up for.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.583
Um, as your sensei,

11:04.667 --> 11:06.875
I am removing your name
from the sign-up sheet.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.667
Well, as my own sensei,

11:11.750 --> 11:14.041
I am putting my name back
on the sign-up sheet.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.250
Can't sign up without a pen! Ha-ha!

11:23.417 --> 11:25.333
Your problem is you're jealous of Chuck.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.750
Why would I be jealous?

11:26.834 --> 11:29.959
Maybe because he owns 55 dojos
across the country and you own one.

11:30.041 --> 11:31.667
I could own 55 dojos.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.250
I just have neither the money
nor the ability.

11:36.583 --> 11:39.792
Just face it, Jack.
The guy's a pompous blowhard.

11:39.875 --> 11:43.291
No, he's not, Rudy.
He takes his karate very seriously.

11:43.375 --> 11:46.834
Whoo! The King is in the house! Hiyah!

11:50.250 --> 11:51.792
Here's your Wizard Weenie.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.458
We make magic in your mouth!

11:56.792 --> 11:59.709
- Marge, we need you back.
We tried to do your job

11:59.792 --> 12:03.083
- and we realized how hard it is.
- And how good my food is?

12:04.125 --> 12:05.875
We realized how hard it is.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.333
Please consider coming back.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.750
I'm not coming back.
You guys didn't appreciate me.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.625
Besides, I've never been happier.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.875
Pushing around a Weenie Wagon?

12:15.959 --> 12:18.083
You don't know
what makes me happy, little girl.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.792
Besides, my dream is dead.

12:20.875 --> 12:22.875
Your dream is to marry Denzel Washington.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.125
That is not a dream. D-Wash will be mine.

12:26.750 --> 12:29.208
I'm talking about opening up a restaurant.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.333
Marge's Homestyle Barbecue.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.333
Ooh, I need a bathroom break.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.834
They make you do everything
in this stupid wizard code.

12:36.917 --> 12:40.750
Base, this is Marge.
I need to use the cave of despair. Pronto!

12:43.000 --> 12:44.583
Why do they call it the cave of despair?

12:44.667 --> 12:46.500
Have you been in the food court bathroom?

12:48.125 --> 12:51.834
You guys, we're gonna make
Marge's dream come true.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.959
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

12:56.041 --> 12:57.875
Worst ninja ever!

12:58.792 --> 13:00.250
Get it?

13:00.333 --> 13:01.959
'Cause he just knocked,

13:02.041 --> 13:05.166
and he literally said "worst ninja ever."

13:05.250 --> 13:07.500
That is so not a good ninja, am I right?

13:10.542 --> 13:13.333
Wow, nice gi, Jack.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.041
Uh, uh, uh, what dojo are you with again?

13:16.125 --> 13:17.208
Right?

13:20.375 --> 13:23.125
You got your fancy gi,
your matching wrist bands,

13:23.208 --> 13:25.000
bet you're even
wearing "Karate King" underpant--

13:25.083 --> 13:26.625
Yes, unfortunately I am.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.750
You know, you're going up against
Byron Kavanaugh on the first round.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.875
He's a master of Muay Thai.
He's probably gonna come at you--

13:34.959 --> 13:36.583
I don't need your help anymore, Rudy.

13:37.291 --> 13:38.542
Be that way.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.458
But I am not telling you
the hilarious joke

13:40.542 --> 13:42.041
I've been telling all the other senseis.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.125
- Worst ninja ever? It's not funny.
- It is the way I tell it!

14:41.625 --> 14:43.333
You sure Marge is gonna show up?

14:43.417 --> 14:45.834
I sent her a text
that should get her attention.

14:45.917 --> 14:48.625
Where is he? Where's my beautiful Denzel?

14:49.792 --> 14:51.834
- He's not here.
- What?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.208
You lied to me?

14:54.792 --> 14:56.542
That's it. I'm tired of this, okay?

14:56.625 --> 14:59.834
-
- No, no, no, Marge, Marge, calm down.

15:01.083 --> 15:04.709
We know you gave up on your dream
of opening Marge's Homestyle Barbecue.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.375
But we didn't.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.000
What are you talking about?

15:12.875 --> 15:15.959
This is exactly
how I pictured it in my dreams.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.625
Okay, look,
your restaurant's gonna be filled

15:17.750 --> 15:19.375
with hungry customers in an hour

15:19.792 --> 15:21.375
and we got you something.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.917
I can't believe you guys
did this just for me.

15:28.917 --> 15:31.166
You children better turn away.
I'm an ugly crier.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.875
Oh, aw...

15:32.959 --> 15:34.834
- You're crying 'cause you're happy
-

15:34.917 --> 15:36.083
and that's just beautiful...

15:39.625 --> 15:41.208
She is an ugly crier.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.959
For lunch today,
we're having barbecued ribs,

15:46.041 --> 15:49.250
baked beans,
and Marge's special cornbread.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.208
Dig in, I'm going to make seconds,
everybody. Whoo!

15:52.542 --> 15:55.583
Well, the best part of this food
is that we didn't have to make it.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.041
It actually looks pretty good.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.250
It smells pretty good.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.000
You think we should give it a try?

16:12.250 --> 16:14.208
All right, people. Don't panic.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.333
There are barf bags under your seats.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.250
<i>Who wants dessert?</i>
Oh, no!

16:20.291 --> 16:22.500
Please proceed in a calm, orderly fashion.

16:22.583 --> 16:26.458
Exit in a single-file line.
Bathrooms are out to the left.

16:27.291 --> 16:29.250
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

16:30.041 --> 16:33.291
Wow, Jerry's really getting into
being Rudy's new cornerman.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.583
Oh, look, he's going to do that

16:34.667 --> 16:36.208
old globe trotters gag
with the spit bucket.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.000
It looks like he's gonna throw it
on the crowd,

16:38.083 --> 16:39.709
but there's nothing in it but confetti.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.125
Oops. Sorry, wrong bucket.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.000
Gah!

16:54.667 --> 16:57.458
-
- Whoo-hoo!

16:57.542 --> 16:59.750
Yeah!

16:59.834 --> 17:03.125
Ladies and gentlemen, you all know me,

17:03.208 --> 17:07.166
I'm Chuck Banner, the Karate King,
best new dojo in town.

17:07.583 --> 17:10.792
Please welcome my new sensei

17:10.875 --> 17:13.583
and the man who's gonna
bring home the gold,

17:13.667 --> 17:15.750
Jack Brewer!

17:23.125 --> 17:25.333
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:25.375 --> 17:29.458
from the Bobby Wasabi Dojo,
Sensei Rudy Gillespie...

17:29.542 --> 17:31.333
Espie, Espie, Espie.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.208
- Rudy.
- Jack.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.458
- Go, Rudy!

17:47.542 --> 17:49.041
- Go, Jack!
- Go, Rudy!

18:19.542 --> 18:21.667
He's countering every one of my strikes.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.417
Do you have any martial arts advice?

18:23.500 --> 18:25.625
Try to win. It's good for business.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.875
Wait, hang on a second,

18:29.333 --> 18:31.458
you're not even
a real black belt, are you?

18:31.917 --> 18:34.500
Well, I'm a black belt at making money,
I can tell you that.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.125
Now get out there and make me look good.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.667
- Ah!
-

19:52.792 --> 19:55.667
Rudy, what was that form?
I've never seen anything like it.

19:55.750 --> 19:58.375
Sure you have. That's Shin do.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.917
Wow, man. You know, I owe you an apology.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.875
You were right.
I'm not ready to be a sensei yet.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.166
You will be.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.333
Great job, Jack.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.375
The camera got some great logo shots.

20:11.709 --> 20:13.834
You know what, Chuck?
I have a lot more to learn

20:13.917 --> 20:15.333
and I want Rudy to be the one to teach me.

20:15.417 --> 20:17.750
Okay, fine. Moving on.

20:17.834 --> 20:19.625
Rudy, nice moves.

20:19.709 --> 20:21.792
- What do you say you join--
- Uh, not interested, Chuck.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.041
All right, fine,

20:23.125 --> 20:27.000
But I'm the one leaving in a Ferrari
with two supermodels and an orangutan.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.709
I'll see you losers later.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.041
Rudy, none of that's important.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.959
The important thing is
is that you're leaving here

20:33.041 --> 20:35.750
with four kids who absolutely
love and respect you.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.917
And you know, the moral of the story
is that... Rudy?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.250
Wait up, Chuck! I call shotgun!

20:48.000 --> 20:50.750
Hey, Rudy, where you been?
- I finally did it.

20:50.834 --> 20:54.083
I destroyed the Chuck Banner Clock.

20:54.166 --> 20:57.125
Yeah. I dropped it off the third story,

20:57.208 --> 20:59.542
hit it a few hundred times
with a cinder block,

20:59.625 --> 21:01.709
then I ran over it
with my buddy's steam roller.

21:03.250 --> 21:06.125
I'll never have to hear
Chuck Banner's dumb voice again.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.166
<i>It's time to kick butt! Hiyah!</i>

21:08.250 --> 21:09.458
<i>What?</i>

21:09.542 --> 21:12.000
- I don't believe it, it still works!
- <i>It's time to kick butt! Hiyah!</i>

21:12.083 --> 21:14.834
That's it, I'm finding a volcano
and I'm throwing it in!

21:16.083 --> 21:19.041
<i>Hiyah! It's time to kick butt!
Hiyah!</i>

21:19.125 --> 21:21.333
<i>It's time to kick butt! Hiyah!</i>

21:21.417 --> 21:23.417
<i>It's time to kick butt! Hiyah!</i>

21:23.500 --> 21:24.500
Jerry.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.583
Okay, don't you people judge me.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.291
That clock really is half past awesome.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.542
<i>It's time to kick butt!</i>
- Hiyah!

21:56.917 --> 21:57.875
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.000 --> 22:02.959
<i>Yes!</i>
