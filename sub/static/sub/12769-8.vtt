00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:08.625 --> 00:09.625
NURSE:
Welcome back, Dr. King.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.000
Thank you.

00:13.083 --> 00:15.375
( tender theme playing )

00:23.375 --> 00:24.375
( Charlotte screams )

00:27.166 --> 00:28.166
( Charlotte screams )

00:29.875 --> 00:31.041
( Charlotte screams )

00:34.083 --> 00:37.000
( whimpering )

00:44.917 --> 00:46.583
You're staring at me again.

00:46.625 --> 00:47.875
No, I'm not.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.625
( Sam sighs )

00:52.208 --> 00:53.583
Okay, I am.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.542
You ready to talk about it now?

00:59.291 --> 01:01.041
I can't.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.417
( sighs )

01:02.458 --> 01:03.709
You can tell me.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.250
Whatever it is.

01:05.291 --> 01:06.750
I can keep a secret.

01:10.041 --> 01:11.375
Stop staring at me.

01:11.417 --> 01:13.417
You were staring at me first.

01:14.667 --> 01:15.959
You wanna play doctor?

01:18.083 --> 01:20.709
I can be the doctor
and you can be the patient.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.667
( chuckles )

01:22.709 --> 01:24.500
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.542
Oh.

01:27.375 --> 01:30.417
( Addison moaning )

01:30.458 --> 01:31.959
No. No.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
No, I can't talk about it.

01:35.375 --> 01:37.291
( sighs )

01:40.917 --> 01:42.709
Has anyone talked to Charlotte?

01:42.750 --> 01:44.083
I left her a couple messages,

01:44.125 --> 01:45.667
but she-- She didn't call
me back.

01:45.709 --> 01:46.917
What do we say?

01:46.959 --> 01:48.417
SAM:
"Get well" or "Sorry this
happened"

01:48.458 --> 01:49.625
both seem pretty ridiculous.

01:49.667 --> 01:51.250
AMELIA:
Is there a card that says:

01:51.291 --> 01:54.041
"I'm sorry you got viciously
beaten and robbed"?

01:54.083 --> 01:56.291
You need to learn to filter
before you speak.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.333
You must have talked to her.

01:57.375 --> 01:58.542
I sent flowers.

01:58.583 --> 01:59.542
Oh, flowers. Crap.

01:59.583 --> 02:01.041
I should have sent her flowers.

02:01.083 --> 02:04.041
Hey. Charlotte went
to the hospital first,

02:04.083 --> 02:05.542
but now she's parking
downstairs,

02:05.583 --> 02:06.667
so I need-- I need, uh...

02:06.709 --> 02:08.000
You need to go to the gym.

02:08.041 --> 02:11.542
Shut up.
She's gonna be here any second.

02:11.583 --> 02:12.667
Just don't act weird.

02:12.709 --> 02:14.041
You're setting a great example.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.041
Just tell her she looks great.
Does she?

02:16.083 --> 02:18.041
No. She looks like she got
the crap kicked out of her.

02:18.083 --> 02:19.542
( Sam muttering )
But-- Shh. Ahem.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.792
Good morning.
SAM &amp; AMELIA: Morning.

02:26.917 --> 02:29.542
Take a good look,
then get over it.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.959
If you're gonna be all nervous
and annoying around me,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.792
just stay the hell
out of my way.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.375
What did I say?

02:48.417 --> 02:49.542
I said don't act weird

02:49.583 --> 02:51.083
and you all acted weird.

02:51.125 --> 02:53.041
Like weird people.

02:55.250 --> 02:58.500
Well, I thought it went about
as well as could be expected.

02:58.542 --> 03:01.041
I think it's too soon
for her to be back.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.834
Well, look, I mean,
she faced everybody.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.709
Clearly stated her needs.
She told us off.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.959
Therapeutically speaking,
that's a good day's work.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.083
Violet's right.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.542
Either you get swallowed up
by that kind of trauma

03:10.583 --> 03:13.417
or you try to regain
control of your life.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.500
Charlotte's regaining control.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.667
I just got your page.

03:21.709 --> 03:23.542
Elisa, it's gonna be okay.

03:23.583 --> 03:26.041
All right, you're gonna feel
a little pinch.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.208
( Elisa winces )

03:27.250 --> 03:28.583
I'm in.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.625
Now we just have
to drain the fluid.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.375
( Elisa panting )

03:37.667 --> 03:39.625
( sighing )

03:39.667 --> 03:40.792
Thank you, Dr. Wilder.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.375
PETE:
No problem.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.291
You did great.

03:44.333 --> 03:47.834
Papi, I'm okay. Really.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.166
She isn't, is she?
Her cancer's back.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.166
I'm sorry.
I think the lymphoma tissue

03:52.208 --> 03:53.583
has seeded the pericardium.

03:53.625 --> 03:55.041
We'll have to confirm
with the CT.

03:55.083 --> 03:57.625
Please don't worry, Papi.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.041
DIEGO:
Her body can't take more chemo.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.041
The last two times,
she lost all her hair.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.834
Her mouth and tongue
were covered in ulcers.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.041
I can try something different
to treat the side effects.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.458
Diego, we've talked about this.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.625
Even after a relapse,

04:07.667 --> 04:09.458
Elisa's type of lymphoma
is curable.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.083
I believe that.
But not with Western medicine.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.041
Chemotherapy is the way
to fight this.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.750
There's another way.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.500
I'm taking Elisa to a shaman.

04:22.542 --> 04:25.125
( pensive theme playing )

04:36.917 --> 04:38.333
Oh, hey.

04:38.375 --> 04:41.667
I was thinking about getting
a latte and then, uh,

04:41.709 --> 04:43.709
you know, I thought of you,
so I went to your office,

04:43.750 --> 04:44.917
but you weren't there

04:44.959 --> 04:47.041
and I thought I'd check
downstairs and--

04:47.083 --> 04:48.458
You sound like a stalker.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
I don't. But...

04:51.542 --> 04:55.041
Okay, I kind of do.
But, uh, coffee?

04:55.083 --> 04:56.709
No, thanks.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.875
Tea, then?

04:59.917 --> 05:04.041
Or we could get one of those
iced, fruity-ccino things.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.000
We're not friends.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.000
( sighs )

05:19.000 --> 05:20.375
You need another pelvic exam

05:20.417 --> 05:21.959
to make sure
you're healing properly.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.166
Not to mention follow-up labs,
continued HIV drugs.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.417
I'll take care of that myself.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.000
Charlotte, you...

05:29.125 --> 05:31.125
All right,
we're not friends.

05:31.166 --> 05:33.041
But we could be.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.166
I could be your friend.

05:35.208 --> 05:38.000
I'm the only one
who knows what happened,

05:38.041 --> 05:39.542
and I could,
I don't know,

05:39.583 --> 05:41.709
be there
for you or whatever.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.458
I only need one thing from you.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.709
Anything. Name it.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.000
Keep your damn trap shut
about what happened.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.375
( sighs )

05:56.417 --> 05:58.041
His daughter has been
through chemo twice

05:58.083 --> 05:59.417
and her cancer is back.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.417
You can't blame Diego
for wanting to try something.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.375
Consulting a witch doctor
instead of an oncologist

06:03.417 --> 06:04.667
borders on child abuse.

06:04.709 --> 06:05.875
Shamans have been healing people

06:05.917 --> 06:07.041
for thousands of years, Cooper.

06:07.083 --> 06:08.625
So even if you
don't believe in it--

06:08.667 --> 06:09.750
Elisa's mother didn't.

06:09.792 --> 06:11.667
This would not be an issue
if Alice were alive.

06:11.709 --> 06:12.875
She would never
let a medicine man

06:12.917 --> 06:14.542
try to clear the trauma
in Elisa's soul

06:14.583 --> 06:17.250
to restore the balance in her
body, because it's crap.

06:17.291 --> 06:19.041
You know as well as I do
that a person's faith

06:19.083 --> 06:20.583
plays a huge role
in their recovery.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.542
So if Elisa and Diego believe
a shaman can help,

06:22.583 --> 06:23.583
then she can.

06:23.625 --> 06:26.000
She is sick, Pete.
She needs real help.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.041
She does need help.

06:27.083 --> 06:29.667
And if you wanna
be a part of it, open your mind.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.667
With all my health problems,

06:33.709 --> 06:36.792
I feel like I've robbed
you of your youth.

06:36.834 --> 06:39.834
Heh. My youth was spent
just fine.

06:39.875 --> 06:42.041
Every week, we come in here,

06:42.083 --> 06:44.875
and all I can think about is,
it's not fair.

06:44.917 --> 06:46.667
I mean, first
it was my diabetes.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.625
You had that long
before I met you.

06:48.667 --> 06:51.083
Doesn't count.
And then the breast cancer.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.834
Which we beat together.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.041
( Rachel sighs )

06:54.083 --> 06:56.041
Taking care of me is exhausting.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.667
I see it in you.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.875
And sometimes I'm afraid
you'll start to resent me.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.041
Oh, that's crazy.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.500
No, wait, Nick.
Let's talk about that.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.667
How do you relieve the stress

07:08.709 --> 07:10.417
that her illness
puts on your marriage?

07:10.458 --> 07:12.875
Do you exercise?
Do you drink?

07:12.917 --> 07:15.709
Not for years. On either count.

07:16.709 --> 07:17.709
You fight?

07:20.667 --> 07:23.625
( dramatic theme playing )

07:23.667 --> 07:25.709
We fight, sure.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.667
Every couple does.
That's true.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.667
So why is it making you
so uncomfortable?

07:34.583 --> 07:36.709
She doesn't mean to, but--
Nick!

07:36.750 --> 07:38.583
( Rachel sighs and sniffs )

07:39.792 --> 07:42.000
I'm sorry.
My last patient was, uh...

07:42.041 --> 07:43.000
I've got some more right here.

07:46.792 --> 07:47.792
It's okay, honey.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.875
I don't wanna talk about it.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.041
( Nick grunts )

07:51.083 --> 07:52.250
Rachel.
RACHEL: Unh.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.500
Rachel!

07:53.542 --> 07:56.750
( Rachel crying )

07:58.834 --> 08:00.375
She doesn't mean to.

08:00.417 --> 08:02.333
( dramatic theme playing )

08:06.041 --> 08:09.417
Rachel?
"Rachel and Nick" Rachel?

08:09.458 --> 08:11.125
She's been with him
for 20 years.

08:11.166 --> 08:12.709
I mean, people get
upset in therapy.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.709
No, this was not
an emotional outburst.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.500
Okay, it was
an adrenaline surge.

08:17.542 --> 08:19.834
It was the kind of rage
you see from an addict.

08:19.875 --> 08:20.834
Is she taking drugs?

08:20.875 --> 08:22.709
Yes, but not the kind you think.

08:22.750 --> 08:23.917
We're managing her diabetes

08:23.959 --> 08:25.500
and the kidney problems
that causes,

08:25.542 --> 08:26.709
but she's not a junkie.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.625
In fact, she's the most
resilient woman I know.

08:28.667 --> 08:31.750
She never complains about
her health, never stops trying.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.041
Well-- No, she's incredible.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.625
She's abusive.

08:34.667 --> 08:37.000
Sheldon, come on.
She was a ballerina

08:37.041 --> 08:39.542
and Nick looks like
a lumberjack.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.709
Really, I mean, how badly
can she really hurt him?

08:41.750 --> 08:43.041
Abuse is abuse.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.792
Would we be having
this conversation

08:44.834 --> 08:46.583
if Rachel were the one being hit
instead of Nick?

08:46.625 --> 08:48.000
Sheldon.
I'm serious.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.041
Would you tell a woman to stay
with an abusive spouse?

08:50.083 --> 08:52.834
No. But this is...
Okay, this feels different.

08:52.875 --> 08:55.333
Rachel and Nick
are not a cautionary tale,

08:55.375 --> 08:56.542
they're a love story.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.417
You ever heard
of Judith and Holofernes?

08:58.458 --> 09:00.041
Famous love story.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.375
Ends with Judith chopping
off the head of her beloved.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.792
You know, Florence,
great paintings

09:03.834 --> 09:06.625
by Rubens and Rembrandt.
You should see them.

09:08.917 --> 09:10.750
What?
Nothing. You're just

09:10.792 --> 09:14.083
a little odd and pretentious.

09:15.667 --> 09:16.792
But I'm not wrong.

09:16.834 --> 09:18.333
Something's going
on with Rachel.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.333
( sighs )

09:24.125 --> 09:25.041
What's wrong, Coop?

09:25.083 --> 09:26.500
Shamans.

09:26.542 --> 09:27.583
Shamans.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.000
And Charlotte.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.000
Shamans and Charlotte?

09:30.041 --> 09:33.583
No, no, no. Mostly Charlotte.

09:33.625 --> 09:36.041
She's having nightmares,
she wakes up screaming.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.041
I try to get her to eat,
she says she's not hungry.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.709
I try to talk about
the police investigation,

09:39.750 --> 09:42.625
she just shuts me down.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.917
Well, she's trying
to put herself back together

09:44.959 --> 09:46.083
in her own way, Coop.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.500
There's no blueprint
for any of this.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.041
Yeah, no, I-- I-I know that.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.542
Everyone handles
trauma differently.

09:50.583 --> 09:51.875
It takes time to heal.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.834
You gotta put one foot
in front of blah, blah, blah.

09:53.875 --> 09:56.750
Glad to see you hold the tools
of my profession in high regard.

09:56.792 --> 09:58.041
Well, none of that helps me,
Violet.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.667
Well, it's not about you,
Cooper.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.625
It's about Charlotte.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.750
So you're saying...

10:03.750 --> 10:04.709
Back off.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.625
You're a bad shrink.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.041
Can I hide out here for a while?

10:08.083 --> 10:10.542
Yeah. As long as you want.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.375
I have to report
the abuse, Nick.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.667
If you say anything,
I'll deny it.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.583
She's hitting you.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.667
Most of the time she's fine.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.500
And when she's not,
I can handle her.

10:28.542 --> 10:31.709
For now.
But what I saw, it...

10:31.750 --> 10:32.750
She could hurt you.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.875
Are you married, Dr. Wallace?

10:37.917 --> 10:39.667
No.

10:39.709 --> 10:42.917
Then with all due respect,
you can't understand.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.083
I met her right out
of journalism school.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.667
I was a reporter for the Times,

10:49.709 --> 10:53.291
got tagged to cover
a performance of Swan Lake.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.333
What the hell did I know
about ballet, right?

10:56.375 --> 10:58.041
But when I saw her dance,

10:58.083 --> 11:02.750
I don't know,
she was just mesmerizing.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.000
She has this quality like

11:05.041 --> 11:08.000
when you're with her,
nothing else matters.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.750
I won't give up on her.

11:11.792 --> 11:12.959
Not ever.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.917
( knocking )

11:22.959 --> 11:24.041
( sighs )

11:24.083 --> 11:25.041
Who sent you to spy on me?

11:25.083 --> 11:28.000
Cooper? Addison?

11:28.041 --> 11:29.542
I came looking
for you on my own.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.166
I figured your day
was probably pretty weird

11:31.208 --> 11:34.375
and you might need some
sugary, deep-fried batter.

11:35.709 --> 11:36.625
( chuckles )

11:38.458 --> 11:39.458
So are you--?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.041
If you ask me if I'm okay,
I swear to God

11:41.083 --> 11:43.041
I'll take this cast
and knock you upside the head.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.500
I wasn't gonna ask you that.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.542
When I first kicked drugs,
I took up running.

11:52.583 --> 11:55.792
I mean, an addict's gotta be
addicted to something, right?

11:55.834 --> 11:57.458
So I would get up
when it was still dark

11:57.500 --> 12:00.834
and I would go for miles.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.875
Until the morning
I got clipped by a minivan.

12:03.917 --> 12:07.041
I didn't get anything like
the injuries that you have,

12:07.083 --> 12:09.625
but I started
craving pills again.

12:11.625 --> 12:16.458
So I was thinking that maybe
you were craving pills again.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.083
I took your advice
and I'm back at meetings.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.083
And if you wanna go--

12:23.125 --> 12:25.667
I grew up wrestling
two brothers.

12:25.709 --> 12:27.667
I have an incredibly
high pain threshold.

12:28.709 --> 12:30.500
Anything else?

12:33.041 --> 12:34.208
( elevator bell dings )

12:34.250 --> 12:36.709
Can--? Can you hold that?

12:38.125 --> 12:39.750
Hey.
Hey.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.500
I got Nick to agree
to bring Rachel in.

12:42.542 --> 12:43.500
Would you check her out?

12:43.542 --> 12:45.291
Of course.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.959
[MOUTHS]
Okay.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.333
( bell rings )

12:49.375 --> 12:50.709
Sheldon.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.041
It's been a while since
we've discussed man troubles

12:53.083 --> 12:54.750
and I was beginning to think

12:54.792 --> 12:56.041
you'd found another therapist.

12:56.083 --> 12:59.458
Oh. No, I wanna talk
about Charlotte.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.041
Do you think she's okay?

13:01.083 --> 13:02.959
Because I don't,
but she won't listen to me.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.333
I didn't realize
you two were close.

13:04.375 --> 13:07.041
Well, we're not, exactly,

13:07.083 --> 13:08.792
but I was there that night

13:09.917 --> 13:11.291
and it was horrific.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.667
If it was Nai or Amelia,
I'd know what to do.

13:13.709 --> 13:16.250
But because it's Charlotte--
She's just not interested.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.083
It's because you were
there that night.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.291
No, she wanted me there.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.917
No, at the time, yes.

13:20.959 --> 13:23.291
But you saw her when she was
in her most fragile state.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.375
Which means you're the living,

13:25.417 --> 13:27.542
breathing reminder
of what happened.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.500
When she sees you,
she's that victim again.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.041
I just wanna help.

13:33.083 --> 13:37.000
Well, then, you'll need to find
a more indirect way to do it.

13:38.709 --> 13:39.750
Um...

13:40.959 --> 13:42.375
( bell rings )

13:42.417 --> 13:46.375
( elevator whirring )

13:46.417 --> 13:49.375
( shaman speaking in Spanish)

14:05.667 --> 14:06.750
Hi.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.041
Thank you for allowing
us to observe.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.375
I brought something for Elisa.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.041
The medicine men
I've worked with

14:13.083 --> 14:15.041
say that quartz
is a very powerful healer.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.041
So you understand my beliefs?

14:17.083 --> 14:18.834
PETE:
I worked with a shaman
in the Congo

14:18.875 --> 14:20.041
to treat an outbreak of measles.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.333
And you think it was the shaman
that cured those people

14:22.375 --> 14:23.583
and not the vaccinations?

14:23.625 --> 14:25.041
Maybe it was one thing,
maybe it was both.

14:25.083 --> 14:28.166
Either way, people got better.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.041
DIEGO:
I know you think
I'm crazy, Dr. Freedman.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.041
But my only concern
is that Elisa get well.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.583
We tried Western medicine.
It failed.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.542
It kept her alive.

14:37.583 --> 14:38.750
It killed my wife.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.583
Alice died of an aneurysm
that ruptured.

14:41.625 --> 14:42.750
Nobody could have saved her.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.333
And Elisa,
she can still be saved.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.375
( Elisa gasping )

14:46.417 --> 14:47.583
( dramatic theme playing )

14:47.625 --> 14:48.667
Papi, is she okay?

14:48.709 --> 14:50.041
Elisa?

14:50.083 --> 14:51.625
( Diego speaks in Spanish )

14:51.667 --> 14:53.166
PETE: Elisa?
COOPER: She needs help.

14:53.208 --> 14:54.458
She's getting help.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.041
It's just the bad energy
leaving her body.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.000
I'm not getting a pulse.
DIEGO: Leave her alone.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.583
PETE: I'm calling an ambulance.
Stop it. Let the shaman finish.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.417
COOPER:
Elisa, stay with me now.
Come on.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.250
( dramatic theme playing )

15:20.542 --> 15:22.041
Is Elisa okay?
Yes.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.709
She was in hypotensive shock

15:23.750 --> 15:25.041
by the time
the ambulance got here,

15:25.083 --> 15:27.500
so she needed surgery
to make a small incision

15:27.542 --> 15:28.709
in the sac around the heart

15:28.750 --> 15:30.542
to drain the fluid.
She's in recovery now.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.041
Can she come home?

15:32.083 --> 15:33.834
She's gonna have to stay
here for a few more days.

15:33.875 --> 15:35.625
COOPER:
I'd like to keep her under
observation

15:35.667 --> 15:36.917
while we start chemo.

15:36.959 --> 15:38.667
You brought Elisa here
against my wishes.

15:38.709 --> 15:39.917
I want her discharged.

15:39.959 --> 15:41.041
PETE:
No, she can't go anyplace

15:41.083 --> 15:42.542
until the surgical
drain's removed.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.041
Do you understand what's
happening?

15:44.083 --> 15:46.041
She has a tube draining fluid
out of her heart

15:46.083 --> 15:48.458
and she has a tumor
that's getting larger every day,

15:48.500 --> 15:50.041
and no shaman can stop that.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.917
Elisa is my daughter
and I will decide

15:51.959 --> 15:53.333
what medical treatment she--

15:53.375 --> 15:55.458
Not if you're incapable of
making a responsible decision.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.208
Alternative therapies work,
Cooper.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.583
I've seen patients cured.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.750
With the right combination
of homeopathic remedies,

16:00.792 --> 16:02.750
Elisa can get the kind
of treatment Diego wants.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.166
COOPER:
Enough. I'm sorry.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.750
I don't care what Diego wants.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.041
I'm getting a judge
to order Elisa's chemo.

16:08.083 --> 16:09.166
No, you can't do that.

16:09.208 --> 16:11.458
Yes, I can.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.583
And I will.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.125
( tender pop music playing )

16:25.542 --> 16:28.750
( both moan )

16:28.792 --> 16:30.500
Sam, I have to tell you
something.

16:30.542 --> 16:32.709
Right now?

16:32.750 --> 16:34.041
Do you wanna know my secret

16:34.083 --> 16:35.542
or do you wanna have
sex with me?

16:35.583 --> 16:39.000
Well, both would be good. Right?

16:49.667 --> 16:52.000
I did something the other night.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.792
A rape kit.

16:57.959 --> 17:00.041
Okay, we really need to work
on your pillow talk.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.750
Technically, it was just some
washings, but see the thing is

17:02.792 --> 17:06.041
that the victim didn't want it.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.125
Wait, what?

17:07.166 --> 17:08.542
She was upset

17:08.583 --> 17:11.208
and I thought she might
want the DNA later,

17:11.250 --> 17:12.750
so I went ahead
and did it anyway,

17:12.792 --> 17:14.041
but then I didn't tell her.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.542
And then I labeled it Jane Doe

17:15.583 --> 17:18.917
and I locked it in the hospital
refrigerator, but...

17:20.083 --> 17:21.375
But I didn't report it.

17:21.417 --> 17:24.000
Well, that's illegal.
Why wouldn't you--?

17:29.083 --> 17:31.000
Because Charlotte
made you promise.

17:35.417 --> 17:36.500
( sighs )

17:40.250 --> 17:44.125
( light-hearted theme playing )

17:47.625 --> 17:48.875
You're staring at me.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.709
I'm sorry.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.417
And yet you're still
staring at me.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.041
Oh.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.542
It's what we do. The Addisam.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.041
We, uh-- We do that.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.792
Oh, God, I'm starting to sound
like her, aren't I?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.792
Ahh. Oh, brother.

18:06.834 --> 18:07.834
Okay.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.000
Okay. Um, ahem.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.834
I have a thing

18:13.959 --> 18:17.000
that I can't tell you.
Or anyone.

18:18.458 --> 18:21.000
So I'm not gonna tell you.

18:22.083 --> 18:26.041
But I need for you to get
what I'm saying.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.500
What, did I black out
for a minute?

18:31.542 --> 18:33.208
Because you are not
making any sense.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.542
Okay, uh... Talk to Charlotte.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.417
She wants to be left alone.

18:38.458 --> 18:41.041
Well, since when has that
ever stopped you?

18:41.083 --> 18:43.917
I mean, let's face it, Violet,
you're kind of nosy.

18:43.959 --> 18:47.041
I am not.
I'm-- I'm interested.

18:47.083 --> 18:50.041
Okay. Talk to Charlotte.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.959
She needs help.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.709
And you are a shrink.

18:53.750 --> 18:57.792
So do what shrinks do.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.667
I saw Elisa this morning.

19:08.709 --> 19:11.500
She's hanging in there.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.041
No thanks to her
crazy-ass father.

19:13.083 --> 19:15.250
You think taking him to court
is the right thing to do?

19:15.291 --> 19:17.083
I had to. He was threatening
to take her home.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.500
If Diego tells the judge

19:18.542 --> 19:21.041
he's refusing treatment on
religious grounds, you'll lose.

19:21.083 --> 19:22.291
Not necessarily.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.291
The California Supreme Court
prosecuted a mother

19:24.333 --> 19:25.542
whose child died of meningitis.

19:25.583 --> 19:27.625
She'd refused life-saving
medical treatment

19:27.667 --> 19:29.083
in favor of divine healing.

19:29.125 --> 19:33.041
Look, I get that you're worried
about Elisa.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.917
I am too.

19:34.959 --> 19:37.500
But you're not gonna help her
by tearing her family apart.

19:37.542 --> 19:39.583
If Diego won't look out for his
daughter's best interests,

19:39.625 --> 19:41.375
I will.

19:41.417 --> 19:43.375
I don't know what I would do
if she was my kid.

19:43.417 --> 19:46.291
But Elisa and Diego have a right
to follow their beliefs.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.709
They're not crazy, Cooper.
They're just different.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.375
And if you take them
to court to force chemo,

19:54.667 --> 19:56.583
I'll testify on their behalf.

19:56.625 --> 20:00.000
( dramatic theme playing )

20:02.083 --> 20:03.834
He never complains.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.625
His only concern
is that I'll get hurt.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.041
I don't mean to get so angry,

20:08.083 --> 20:10.583
I just can't control myself.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.625
( sighs )

20:12.667 --> 20:15.041
Okay, enough whining.
What do you think is going on?

20:15.083 --> 20:18.166
Well, there's nothing
on the head MRI or chest CT.

20:18.208 --> 20:21.041
But I did find a high level
of testosterone in your blood

20:21.083 --> 20:24.625
which could be caused by a tumor
of the adrenal glands or lungs,

20:24.667 --> 20:26.709
but I ruled that out.
That's good news.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.542
Or by metastatic breast cancer.

20:29.917 --> 20:34.041
But I had a mastectomy
ten years ago.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.709
I know. But sometimes breast
cancer cells get left behind

20:36.750 --> 20:38.000
and grow somewhere else.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.041
That could be a tumor
on your ovary.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.458
And if it's secreting
testosterone,

20:42.500 --> 20:44.667
that buildup
could cause sudden rages.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.083
Are you sure?

20:46.125 --> 20:48.166
The only way to know for sure

20:48.208 --> 20:49.709
would be to go in
and take a look.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.458
But surgery is a big gamble
for someone in your health.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.041
I don't care.
I wanna do it for Nick.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.875
Please, Dr. Montgomery.

20:57.917 --> 21:00.125
I-- I can't hurt
my husband anymore.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.125
( knocking on door )

21:08.500 --> 21:09.500
You got a minute?

21:09.542 --> 21:12.041
What for?
It's been a few days.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.667
I should take a look
at your injuries.

21:14.709 --> 21:15.959
They're fine.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.917
Then this will be fast.

21:17.959 --> 21:20.750
We can do it here
or we can go to an exam room.

21:23.667 --> 21:24.875
Let's just get this over with.

21:39.792 --> 21:41.750
Everything is healing
up beautifully.

21:41.792 --> 21:43.000
I told you.

21:45.542 --> 21:47.166
Okay. Let's take
a look at your back.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.709
( tense theme playing )

21:55.083 --> 21:56.583
Oh, here, I got it. I got it.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.542
Hmm.

22:09.583 --> 22:12.583
Cooper did a crap job
changing this bandage.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.041
He didn't do it.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.750
I did.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
( Charlotte whimpers )

22:27.083 --> 22:29.709
( winces )

22:29.750 --> 22:31.333
( grunts )

22:32.875 --> 22:35.750
( panting )

22:37.834 --> 22:39.041
( Charlotte winces )

22:45.417 --> 22:47.041
( sniffs )

22:47.083 --> 22:48.500
I got it.

22:55.667 --> 22:58.500
When it needs to be changed
again, let me know.

23:17.875 --> 23:22.709
Hey. Sorry I had to run out
so early this morning.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.041
You wanna have lunch?

23:24.083 --> 23:25.583
What is it with you people
and food?

23:25.625 --> 23:27.583
I don't want coffee
or tea or donuts.

23:27.625 --> 23:29.083
Can't you just leave me alone?

23:29.125 --> 23:31.458
I was just trying
to be thoughtful.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.583
No, you came in here
to check on me.

23:33.625 --> 23:36.041
I want you to stop hovering.
I'm not hovering.

23:36.083 --> 23:38.250
All I need is for you
and everybody else to back off.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.000
Okay, I'm not everybody,
I'm your fiancé.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.667
I'm in this with you.

23:43.709 --> 23:45.834
You are not inside this, Cooper.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.333
You have no idea.

23:48.667 --> 23:49.959
And now the way
you're looking at me.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.542
Just stop.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.041
I can't take it.
I can't breathe.

23:54.083 --> 23:55.667
Charlotte.

23:55.709 --> 23:57.750
( dramatic theme playing )

24:02.583 --> 24:05.417
Dr. Montgomery will remove
Rachel's tumor,

24:05.458 --> 24:06.625
then stage it to determine

24:06.667 --> 24:08.041
the necessary postoperative
treatment.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.458
And if all goes well,

24:09.500 --> 24:11.500
Rachel's testosterone
levels will decrease

24:11.542 --> 24:13.458
and she'll have more control
over her anger.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.667
Good. That's good.

24:15.709 --> 24:17.041
But if the surgery
isn't successful

24:17.083 --> 24:18.875
and Rachel's rages continue--

24:18.917 --> 24:20.083
We'll get through it.

24:23.375 --> 24:27.333
The love you and Rachel have
for each other, it's a gift.

24:27.375 --> 24:29.750
Under normal circumstances,
I would work

24:29.792 --> 24:32.542
to keep this marriage healthy
another 50 years.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.625
But sometimes--

24:37.834 --> 24:40.709
Sometimes I have to counsel
people to walk away.

24:41.959 --> 24:44.500
No one stays together anymore.

24:44.542 --> 24:47.959
They just have a fight,
get a divorce,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.875
pretend like
it never happened.

24:49.917 --> 24:53.291
When instead, they should
be fighting for each other

24:53.333 --> 24:55.583
through whatever comes.

24:55.625 --> 24:58.125
This is what love
is supposed to be.

24:58.166 --> 25:01.375
I'm never walking away.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.709
( tender pop music playing )

25:04.750 --> 25:07.041
( door opens )

25:07.083 --> 25:09.083
Hey, Elisa. How you feeling?

25:09.125 --> 25:11.625
Much, much better.

25:11.667 --> 25:12.542
I'm ready to go home now.

25:12.583 --> 25:14.667
You need to heal
a bit more first.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.750
Papi told me Dr. Freedman
is bringing in a judge.

25:20.166 --> 25:23.041
Please. I don't want chemo.

25:25.166 --> 25:27.583
Do you believe a shaman
can heal you?

25:27.625 --> 25:28.750
Papi does.

25:28.792 --> 25:31.000
Forget your father
and Dr. Freedman.

25:31.041 --> 25:33.750
I wanna know what you believe.

25:33.792 --> 25:35.458
If you have faith in the shaman,

25:35.500 --> 25:37.000
I will back you with the judge.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.041
It's okay. You can tell me.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.792
Elisa, what is it?

25:46.792 --> 25:49.000
I don't want chemo.

26:00.875 --> 26:01.917
Addison?

26:04.083 --> 26:06.250
How long you been out here?
I don't know.

26:06.291 --> 26:07.792
( sighs )

26:07.834 --> 26:09.709
I couldn't sleep.

26:09.750 --> 26:11.083
Hey.

26:11.125 --> 26:12.375
( sighs )

26:12.417 --> 26:13.709
It's gonna be okay.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.250
Not if Violet doesn't talk
to Charlotte.

26:15.291 --> 26:16.417
She will.

26:16.458 --> 26:19.000
What if somebody decides to look

26:19.041 --> 26:20.041
in the lab fridge, you know?

26:20.083 --> 26:21.834
And they wonder what
the Jane Doe bag is?

26:21.875 --> 26:24.041
I don't know what
I was thinking.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.041
You were thinking that
you wanted to help a friend.

26:26.083 --> 26:29.750
I could lose my license, Sam.
What am I supposed to do?

26:32.125 --> 26:33.709
We wait.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.500
Violet will come through.

26:38.959 --> 26:40.917
CHARLOTTE:
Is that fresh?

26:40.959 --> 26:43.000
I just made it.

26:44.083 --> 26:45.750
Help yourself.

26:47.959 --> 26:49.000
Thank you, Sheldon.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.291
For what?

26:52.875 --> 26:54.000
Leaving me alone.

26:56.542 --> 26:59.000
I wish everybody
else would just, uh...

27:01.083 --> 27:02.625
...do nothing.

27:02.667 --> 27:05.750
I'd do nothing
for you anytime.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.959
You know that, right?

27:09.041 --> 27:10.542
I do.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.583
How's it going?

27:19.625 --> 27:20.667
Just dandy. Thanks.

27:20.709 --> 27:23.000
You know, I, uh...

27:24.792 --> 27:28.625
I know how hard it can be to
reintegrate after you've been...

27:29.750 --> 27:33.041
...victimized.
So if you ever wanna talk...

27:33.083 --> 27:34.542
You always been such a busybody

27:34.583 --> 27:36.750
or is that just
a professional hazard?

27:36.792 --> 27:39.667
Heh. No, actually,
Charlotte, I--

27:39.709 --> 27:42.208
I truly believe
in the therapeutic process.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.792
And after Katie attacked me--

27:43.834 --> 27:45.583
You think because a crazy woman
cut out your baby

27:45.625 --> 27:47.041
you've got
some kind of an insight

27:47.083 --> 27:48.250
into what makes me tick?

27:50.083 --> 27:52.083
You don't.

27:52.125 --> 27:56.041
All you've got is a nasty scar
and a horror story.

27:56.083 --> 28:00.291
You're damaged goods, Violet.
You, not me.

28:01.667 --> 28:05.542
You got no business telling
anybody how to run their lives.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.875
PETE:
You got any tips for getting
a 14-year-old to talk?

28:15.917 --> 28:18.041
I really wanna
go to bat for Elisa,

28:18.083 --> 28:19.542
but she's holding
something back.

28:19.583 --> 28:21.125
Well, she's a kid.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.792
Even as adults, we're reluctant

28:23.834 --> 28:25.750
to say certain things out loud.

28:25.792 --> 28:27.041
You know, it makes it real.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.667
And then, you know,
you have to deal with it.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.458
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.667
Pete Wilder, open book.

28:32.709 --> 28:35.000
( both laugh )

28:36.208 --> 28:39.625
I know. It's not fair.

28:39.667 --> 28:41.208
I push you to tell me things.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.000
And then I have stuff myself.

28:46.917 --> 28:49.709
There was...

28:49.750 --> 28:51.667
Well, it happened
a long time ago.

28:51.709 --> 28:53.041
In college.

28:53.083 --> 28:56.000
And I never told you.

29:00.625 --> 29:02.000
Violet, I know.

29:03.625 --> 29:05.917
Or, at least, I suspected.

29:08.959 --> 29:13.500
We have been through a lot.

29:13.542 --> 29:17.000
And I've seen you react
in so many ways.

29:21.041 --> 29:22.500
Why didn't you say anything?

29:23.542 --> 29:25.041
I figured that when
you were ready

29:25.083 --> 29:26.542
to talk about it, you would.

29:36.792 --> 29:38.208
I'm probably wrong.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.875
What?

29:39.917 --> 29:41.959
Well, you were the first one
to see her that night.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Is it possible...?

29:45.542 --> 29:46.834
Was Charlotte raped?

29:46.875 --> 29:48.959
If she told me,
you know I couldn't--

29:49.000 --> 29:50.583
No, I know. I know. Of course.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
But what do you think?

29:56.583 --> 29:58.542
( sighs )

29:58.583 --> 30:00.000
I think you're right.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.709
Don't.

30:31.333 --> 30:32.583
( sighs )

30:38.166 --> 30:40.542
What can I do?

30:40.583 --> 30:42.000
What do you need?

30:46.750 --> 30:48.834
Lie really close to me.

30:50.417 --> 30:52.125
But don't touch me.

31:17.875 --> 31:20.041
It's been a long time
since I wore a pair of these.

31:20.083 --> 31:21.542
What are you doing here?

31:21.583 --> 31:22.834
I came to wish you luck.

31:22.875 --> 31:24.125
Thanks.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.041
You know, Nick and Rachel,
they're special.

31:26.083 --> 31:28.333
A lot of couples stay together
for the long haul,

31:28.375 --> 31:29.583
but not many stay in love.

31:29.625 --> 31:31.250
Your parents still married?
Ha, ha.

31:31.291 --> 31:33.333
No, they split
when I was a teenager.

31:33.375 --> 31:34.542
Waterboarding in Guantánamo

31:34.583 --> 31:36.250
was less brutal
than that divorce.

31:36.291 --> 31:38.250
Are you close to them?
I call my mother every week.

31:38.291 --> 31:40.583
But my father and I...

31:40.625 --> 31:44.250
Well, let's just say that when
you wash out of your ER rotation

31:44.291 --> 31:45.834
and you're a surgeon's son,

31:45.875 --> 31:47.625
it doesn't help
the relationship.

31:47.667 --> 31:50.709
I guess it can make you
a little odd and pretentious.

31:52.208 --> 31:54.834
Who's to say
those are bad things?

31:54.875 --> 31:56.750
Call you when it's over.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.041
Alice believed in chemo
and I believed in Alice,

32:02.083 --> 32:04.208
so that's what we did.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.917
But she's gone now.

32:05.959 --> 32:07.417
I've seen
the shaman heal people.

32:07.458 --> 32:09.917
I think she can do the same
for my Elisa.

32:09.959 --> 32:12.083
What do you want, Elisa?

32:13.583 --> 32:15.041
What Papi wants.

32:15.083 --> 32:16.542
COOPER:
And what about your mother?

32:16.583 --> 32:18.041
Alice would have pushed
for chemo.

32:18.083 --> 32:20.083
She wouldn't want you to die.
DIEGO: Don't say that.

32:20.125 --> 32:21.750
How dare you say that?
She's not gonna die.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.750
Your Honor,
what Diego is asking for

32:23.792 --> 32:26.458
may seem unconventional,
but I have seen it work.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.500
As an M.D.
and also a practitioner

32:28.542 --> 32:30.625
of alternative therapies,
I urge you, please,

32:30.667 --> 32:32.458
don't disregard
what Diego is asking for.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.542
The only guaranteed cure
for lymphoma is chemotherapy.

32:35.583 --> 32:39.083
I need to take the family's
religious beliefs into account--

32:39.125 --> 32:40.625
Okay, what kind of father
just stands by

32:40.667 --> 32:41.834
and doesn't save their child?

32:41.875 --> 32:44.166
Stop it. Please, Dr. Freedman.

32:46.083 --> 32:49.000
If I have more chemo,
my family won't make it.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.583
We're living in a trailer park
because of me.

32:52.625 --> 32:56.792
My treatments bankrupted us
and Papi had to sell the house.

32:59.166 --> 33:03.542
I hear you on the phone begging
to keep the power on.

33:03.583 --> 33:07.500
I see you skipping meals
so the rest of us can eat.

33:07.542 --> 33:09.750
Carlos and Pilar,

33:09.792 --> 33:11.458
they deserve a life
that doesn't revolve

33:11.500 --> 33:12.667
around my hospital visits.

33:12.709 --> 33:13.834
DIEGO:
And so do you.

33:15.834 --> 33:17.166
The shaman will save you.

33:17.208 --> 33:18.625
No, she won't.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.709
I'm sorry, Papi.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.625
I don't believe
what you believe.

33:25.792 --> 33:27.959
I'm not afraid.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.792
Let the shaman take me to Mama.

33:33.667 --> 33:36.542
I think we all know
what needs to be done.

33:45.417 --> 33:47.125
Do you think I don't know
what's true anymore

33:47.166 --> 33:48.166
because I was attacked?

33:48.208 --> 33:50.583
I think working
through that experience

33:50.625 --> 33:51.667
has made you a better therapist.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.041
Sam told me
I should talk to Charlotte.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.208
Well, that's not surprising.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.041
You both survived
a brutal trauma.

33:58.083 --> 33:59.750
Yeah, yeah.
But the way he said it,

33:59.792 --> 34:02.208
it was like there was
more to it than that.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.667
And then I started projecting
my own stuff on her.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.000
Well, what sort of stuff?

34:09.709 --> 34:11.834
I wish you had been there.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.166
That night. Then we could
compare notes.

34:14.208 --> 34:16.667
Unfortunately, I spent the night
in an interrogation room

34:16.709 --> 34:19.458
getting throttled
by a rapist, so...

34:19.500 --> 34:21.834
Is that what--?

34:24.041 --> 34:25.333
Do you think Charlotte
was raped?

34:30.458 --> 34:31.875
PETE:
The judge ordered the chemo.

34:31.917 --> 34:33.250
You didn't have to arrange this.

34:33.291 --> 34:35.041
COOPER: I know.
PETE: I'm just saying...

34:35.083 --> 34:36.917
COOPER:
I'm not completely unreasonable.

34:38.542 --> 34:39.834
( chuckles )

34:39.875 --> 34:42.875
( shaman speaking in Spanish )

34:46.959 --> 34:48.792
COOPER:
Thank you for letting
us bend the rules.

34:48.834 --> 34:52.291
I made sure she wasn't gonna
sacrifice a chicken or anything.

34:52.333 --> 34:55.000
( speaking in Spanish )

34:56.542 --> 35:01.500
I know I should leave you alone,
but here's the thing:

35:01.542 --> 35:02.709
I can't.

35:04.166 --> 35:05.625
You're not ready.

35:05.667 --> 35:06.875
( sighs ):
Cooper--

35:06.917 --> 35:08.041
I know you.

35:08.083 --> 35:09.750
( tender theme playing )

35:13.250 --> 35:16.250
( shaman speaking in Spanish )

35:39.583 --> 35:43.333
( melancholy theme playing )

35:43.375 --> 35:44.709
( sniffles )

35:59.000 --> 36:00.208
( sniffs )

36:18.417 --> 36:19.792
( sighs )

36:28.625 --> 36:29.542
( Rachel chuckles )

36:33.417 --> 36:36.417
RACHEL:
It didn't go well, did it?

36:36.458 --> 36:40.375
The tumor was worse than
the imaging originally showed.

36:40.417 --> 36:44.208
I couldn't resect it all.
I removed what I could.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.458
NICK:
No. I can't accept that.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.000
You have to stop the cancer.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.583
How long do I have?

36:54.500 --> 36:56.041
Not as long as you'd want.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.041
( gasps )

36:57.083 --> 36:58.583
Oh.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.750
There are
testosterone-blocking agents

37:01.792 --> 37:04.834
we could try
to manage your anger,

37:04.875 --> 37:06.333
but they're not
very effective.

37:06.375 --> 37:08.959
So I'm just gonna
keep on hurting Nick?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.125
There's nothing I can do?

37:10.166 --> 37:11.792
SHELDON:
You can move into hospice

37:11.834 --> 37:13.291
for round-the-clock
care with people

37:13.333 --> 37:14.667
who know how
to manage your anger

37:14.709 --> 37:15.875
and keep you safe.

37:15.917 --> 37:17.875
What the hell
are you talking about?

37:17.917 --> 37:19.709
Don't listen to him, Rachel.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.083
We can manage at home.

37:23.709 --> 37:26.875
You know that's not true, love.

37:27.959 --> 37:29.041
I'm dying.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.500
You don't know
how long you have.

37:34.542 --> 37:37.041
I want that time with you.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.625
I don't care what you do to me.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.417
But I do.

37:43.959 --> 37:45.291
Those people at hospice,

37:45.333 --> 37:48.667
they won't know how
to take care of you.

37:48.709 --> 37:53.083
I've learned that over the past
20 years. I'm good at it.

37:53.125 --> 37:54.542
Well, then,
you'll tell them how.

37:54.583 --> 37:57.750
Every day,
when you come to visit.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.959
You'll find a place
where I can go?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.125
Yes. I promise.

38:10.542 --> 38:13.333
RACHEL:
It's the right thing, Nick.

38:13.375 --> 38:14.667
You know it is.

38:14.709 --> 38:15.834
( Rachel sniffs )

38:15.875 --> 38:17.041
Please.

38:17.083 --> 38:20.750
Let me take care
of you for once.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.291
( Nick crying )

38:24.333 --> 38:25.792
RACHEL:
Shh, shh, shh.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.709
( knocking on door )

38:30.750 --> 38:32.000
Yeah?

38:36.792 --> 38:37.917
You need something?

38:42.709 --> 38:45.500
It was an Indian summer

38:45.542 --> 38:47.208
my junior year in college,

38:48.417 --> 38:50.250
and I'd left the window open

38:50.291 --> 38:51.458
because it was the only way

38:51.500 --> 38:54.208
to cool down enough
to get to sleep.

38:54.250 --> 38:58.333
So when I first
felt his breath on me,

38:58.375 --> 39:01.875
I thought,
"Finally, a breeze."

39:01.917 --> 39:04.000
And then I opened my eyes.

39:06.083 --> 39:10.166
He wrapped one hand
around my throat

39:10.208 --> 39:14.750
and with the other
ripped off my panties.

39:14.792 --> 39:18.000
He whispered to me:

39:18.041 --> 39:19.583
"Shh, shh, shh."

39:19.625 --> 39:21.750
Like, um...

39:21.792 --> 39:24.709
Like you do to a child

39:24.750 --> 39:26.959
having a bad dream.

39:28.083 --> 39:31.834
He told me
not to make a sound.

39:31.875 --> 39:35.166
And when he finished,

39:35.208 --> 39:38.041
he slammed my head
against the wall

39:38.083 --> 39:41.000
till my hair
was sticky with blood.

39:43.458 --> 39:45.083
I thought...

39:48.083 --> 39:53.125
...that if I stayed quiet,
then I'd be okay.

39:53.166 --> 39:55.792
Like it never happened.

39:58.083 --> 40:01.709
Because things like that--

40:01.750 --> 40:04.000
Well, they don't happen
to people like me.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.041
Or to people like you.

40:07.083 --> 40:08.875
( melancholy pop music
playing )

40:08.917 --> 40:10.500
So...

40:13.667 --> 40:16.083
I just
wanted you to know...

40:18.709 --> 40:20.625
...that I get it.

40:20.667 --> 40:22.834
I get it, Charlotte.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.500
( sniffs )

40:29.083 --> 40:31.333
And I'm here for you.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
( grunting and yelling )

41:04.250 --> 41:07.333
( crying )

41:20.625 --> 41:22.709
Shelly. What are you doing here?

41:24.083 --> 41:26.583
The guy I evaluated last week?
Lee McHenry?

41:26.625 --> 41:27.709
Yeah.

41:27.750 --> 41:29.834
I think I know who he raped.

41:39.375 --> 41:41.041
( sighs )

41:41.083 --> 41:43.000
( dialing cell phone )

41:47.458 --> 41:50.041
Yes, this is
Dr. Addison Montgomery

41:50.083 --> 41:51.583
at St. Ambrose.

41:51.625 --> 41:53.417
I have pelvic washings

41:53.458 --> 41:56.000
from a rape
that need to be processed.

42:06.750 --> 42:09.542
Charlotte? What happened?

42:09.583 --> 42:12.083
Will you go
to a meeting with me?

42:12.125 --> 42:14.125
I'm right behind you.

42:29.250 --> 42:31.250
( upbeat theme playing )
