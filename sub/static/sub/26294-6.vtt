You are a great interview,
Matt.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.272
- Let me know if you need
anything else.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.664
- I know all about the friction

00:12.708 --> 00:14.753
between Boden
and Commissioner Grissom.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.451
- I don't ask you for much.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.409
I'm asking you to help Boden.

00:19.671 --> 00:20.890
- That's right.

00:20.933 --> 00:23.762
- Relinquish your command
of 51.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.590
You will report directly to me.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.331
- You start telling people
what to do,

00:27.375 --> 00:29.290
you disrupt
the chain of command,

00:29.333 --> 00:32.249
and I will not let that happen.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.124
- Sylvie Brett,
I got something

00:37.167 --> 00:38.951
for us to wear
for our uniforms this morning.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.083
- No.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.519
- You don't even know
what it is.

00:41.563 --> 00:45.654
- Cat's ears or headband
with bendy-spring things.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.396
The answer's no.

00:48.439 --> 00:51.312
I hate Halloween.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.140
- People are crazy enough
as it is.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.272
They don't need a holiday
encouraging them.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.448
- Well, if you ask me,
I take Halloween

00:57.492 --> 00:59.102
over Thanksgiving
or Christmas any day,

00:59.146 --> 01:00.625

01:00.669 --> 01:03.585

one roof and add alcohol.

Everything seem
perfectly normal,

01:07.632 --> 01:10.505

expect it--

Boo!

you a head's up,

01:19.862 --> 01:22.125

the morning briefing today.

the battalion chief's job.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.739

the men might be inspired

01:27.783 --> 01:30.786
by someone
with a little more authority.

01:30.829 --> 01:31.787

01:34.442 --> 01:36.618
You can hang back,
man the fort.

commanding units in the field.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.363

01:42.406 --> 01:45.017
I think I can handle it.

his men and women in his hands.

I heard you had a rough time
of it on that call.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.200
- And no wonder.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.202
What have you been teaching
these people, Wallace?

14:15.245 --> 14:17.900
The reckless insubordination
I experienced

14:17.944 --> 14:20.120
is beyond anything
I've ever seen.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.774
It's as if rank has no meaning
for them.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.080
- Well, I wasn't there,

14:24.124 --> 14:25.516
but it doesn't sound
like the men to me.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.692
- Here are the formal
reprimands I'll be filing.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.520
Captain Matt Casey,
for failing to await

14:29.564 --> 14:31.871
my command prior
to entering the structure.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.960
Harold Capp, for making
an insubordinate comment.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.526
- Gorsch--

14:35.570 --> 14:38.051
- Lieutenant Severide, for
taking an insubordinate tone.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.617
And all three officers

14:39.661 --> 14:41.402
for failing to report
when ordered to do so.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.012
- I will fight every single one

14:43.056 --> 14:44.405
of those charges
on their behalf.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.146
- You can't, Wallace.

14:46.189 --> 14:49.758
As you said, you weren't there.

14:49.801 --> 14:54.197
This is how it's gonna work
from now on.

14:55.546 --> 14:58.245
I'm gonna whip this house
into shape.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.598
♪

15:14.739 --> 15:14.914
.

15:20.136 --> 15:23.574
Call was bad, huh?

15:23.618 --> 15:25.968
- Ridiculous.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.188
- I'm sorry for putting you
in that position.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.711
- It's not your fault.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.105
- I'm not sure about that.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.542
- The word untenable
comes to mind.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.806
Right now...

15:37.849 --> 15:39.939
I don't see a way out.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.202
- Well, I got a message from
Benny while we were out.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.986
Says he's got news on
the Grissom front.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.554
He wants to meet at the Palace
after shift.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.599
- Well, that's something.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.428
- We'll see.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.735
I'll keep you posted.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.393
- Thanks, Severide.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.402
- 'Scuse me.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.273
I'm wondering where I can find
Captain Matt Casey.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.101
- Who can I say
is looking for him?

16:12.145 --> 16:14.060
- Naomi.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.844
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.324
What brings you by?

16:17.367 --> 16:19.021
- For starters,
I wanted to thank you again

16:19.065 --> 16:20.849
for your help on
the trailer story.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.372
Looks like federal courts
are stepping in.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.853
Grandbrook has to recall
thousands of units.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.987
- Can't say I'm surprised.
You're a hell of a journalist.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.901
- Well, I couldn't have done it
without you.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.642
- Glad I could help.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.209
- Anyway, the success
of that piece

16:33.253 --> 16:34.689
has me wanting
to do more like it,

16:34.732 --> 16:36.125
and since we work
so well together

16:36.169 --> 16:38.084
I was thinking maybe
I could pick your brain

16:38.127 --> 16:39.563
about some other calls
you've been on.

16:39.607 --> 16:40.869
Not just corporate violations,

16:40.912 --> 16:42.262
but events or incidents

16:42.305 --> 16:44.655
where public awareness might
save lives.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.179
- I'm sure I can think
of a few.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.616
Got a ton of old incident
reports in my quarters

16:48.659 --> 16:49.921
that might jog my memory.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.707
- Lead the way.

16:55.188 --> 16:59.192
- Just not on the--
okay, well, that one's obvious.

16:59.235 --> 17:03.283
- Spanish lessons begin ahora.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.937
- Hey, this is outrageous.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.679
- You guys, Latinos
make up nearly

17:08.723 --> 17:10.333
a third of Chicago's
population.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.683
It behooves all of us
to speak the language.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.860
- You know how many different
tongues are spoken here, Cruz?

17:15.904 --> 17:18.211
Polish, Chinese...

17:19.255 --> 17:21.779
Polish. All right,
you gonna teach them too?

17:21.823 --> 17:22.954
I ain't gonna do it.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.782
I got out of school
for a reason.

17:24.826 --> 17:29.091
- Okay. Everybody,
please repeat after me.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.964
Por favor, tome asiento
en la silla.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.756
- Yeah, guys, okay. All right,
let's just try that again.

17:41.799 --> 17:46.195
Por favor, tome asiento
en la silla.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.897
Go ahead.

17:52.941 --> 17:57.380
- I feel like you're going
about this all wrong.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.990
- I'm all ears.

18:06.520 --> 18:10.089
These guys spend all day
running into burning buildings.

18:10.132 --> 18:14.093
Sticky notes?
I don't think so, kay?

18:14.136 --> 18:15.746
- Well,
what do you have in mind?

18:15.790 --> 18:21.187
- You might wanna try a little
extra visual stimulation.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.016
- That was a close one.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.410
- Sulfuric acid stored without
a permit.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.805
Forklift veered into it
and chemical spill.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.154
- Sounds like complete
negligence

18:32.198 --> 18:33.590
on the part of
the warehouse manager.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.114
- He didn't make it.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.377
Neither did the guy operating
the forklift.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.554
- Damn. What happened
to the company?

18:40.597 --> 18:43.948
- They were fined or sued.
I never got called to testify.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.254
This was a fire that started

18:45.298 --> 18:47.387
in an apartment building
over on Grant Place.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.651
One of the tenants was using
a propane grill to keep warm.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.827
Landlord wasn't providing heat.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.176
- Textbook slum lord.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.874
- One good thing came from it.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.224
Chief Boden met his wife
on that call.

18:58.267 --> 18:59.964
- You mean all I have to do

19:00.008 --> 19:01.792
is fire up the grill in
the middle of my living room

19:01.836 --> 19:03.968
and my days as single woman
are over?

19:05.274 --> 19:07.276
This is all great, really.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.799
I don't want to take up more
of your time

19:08.843 --> 19:10.192
at the firehouse, though.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.585
Could we maybe meet up
for dinner?

19:11.628 --> 19:14.936
Discuss some of these further?
My treat.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.766
- Okay.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.507
I don't get out of here
till tomorrow.

19:20.550 --> 19:23.988
- Oh, no problem. It'll give me
a chance to do some research.

19:26.774 --> 19:30.430
I'm sorry, my tenacity
doesn't have an off switch.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.171
Hazard of the job.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.303
- No--no, it's--nothing.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.265
- You remind me of someone
I know.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.527
Knew.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.659
She was...

19:42.703 --> 19:47.229
pretty tenacious too--
it's an admirable quality.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.972
- So I'll text you with
the restaurant?

19:51.015 --> 19:53.844
- Sounds good.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.151
- Till then.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.166
- Have you ever made ghosts
out of tissues?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.994
You know,
where you crunch up the top,

20:13.037 --> 20:14.125
make a head,
and then you wrap

20:14.169 --> 20:15.518
a rubber band around the neck.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.172
- No.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.521
- I was wondering if we could
do it with gauze too.

20:18.565 --> 20:21.437
We could cover this whole place
with ghosts.

20:21.481 --> 20:22.960
- That sounds terrible.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.353
Um

20:24.397 --> 20:28.705
So what is your connection
to Chaplain Sheffield?

20:28.749 --> 20:32.405
He was at the hospital
when I was a resident.

20:32.448 --> 20:37.584
Just an awesome guy all around.
Helpful, caring.

20:37.627 --> 20:42.328
You guys had kind of a moment
when I introduced you.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.720
No.

20:43.764 --> 20:44.982
- Yeah.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.723
- Okay, Foster,
I was not flirting.

20:46.767 --> 20:47.811
I mean, he's a chaplain.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.378
He's not a priest.

20:49.422 --> 20:52.468
You know, you two would
actually be great together.

20:52.512 --> 20:53.643
You should call him.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.384
No, I can't do that.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.125
No, I'm not--
- Come on, Brett.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.606
When's the last time you went
on a date?

21:01.738 --> 21:04.132

like this?

22:13.984 --> 22:15.899
- I told you not to let her
have so much candy.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.163

This isn't a stomachache.

she eat?

22:32.089 --> 22:34.962

Gummy bears, M&M's,

22:35.005 --> 22:37.356
the kind our neighbors have
given out for years.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.401

half of it.

Draw up one milligram
of Versed.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.252

of Versed.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.514
- It's okay.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.868

23:18.701 --> 23:21.008
- Let's get her to Med.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.929

I'll go to the hospital.

23:39.809 --> 23:40.984

- Hey.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.856
- We're watching the game here.

23:42.899 --> 23:45.511
- I thought we'd try something
new for our Spanish lesson.

23:45.554 --> 23:46.903
- I thought I was clear.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.949
I ain't learning Spanish,
"com-pran-day."

23:51.778 --> 23:53.693
- Hold on a second.

23:57.610 --> 24:00.569
- Hmm.
Elle es caliente, eh?

24:17.456 --> 24:20.415
- Well, Rosalita was
with another guy, Fernando,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.504
in order to make
Enrique jealous.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.985
Or to make him
celoso.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.074
- Okay, but why the hell
is he not all over her?

24:27.117 --> 24:28.902
- Because Enrique dumped
Rosalita

24:28.945 --> 24:30.643
to be with another woman,

24:30.686 --> 24:32.166
who turned out to be a man.

24:33.297 --> 24:35.909
- So now he's
confundido.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.089
- Mm-hmm.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.788
- We managed to make
it through the shift

24:45.832 --> 24:48.399
with only five false calls.

24:48.443 --> 24:49.705
Four choking victims

24:49.749 --> 24:51.272
and one high-as-a-kite
five-year-old.

24:51.315 --> 24:53.666
See? Halloween isn't so bad.

24:53.709 --> 24:57.408
So, Kyle.
Want his number?

24:57.452 --> 24:59.672
I'm not sure.

24:59.715 --> 25:02.065
- Come on.
You'd have a great time.

25:02.109 --> 25:05.591
- Okay, I know I must seem like
a homebody compared to you,

25:05.634 --> 25:07.941
but I'm not just some old lady
who never leaves the house.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.856
You don't have to feel sorry
for me.

25:09.899 --> 25:12.249
- Brett, I'm not suggesting
it for you.

25:12.293 --> 25:16.427
I-I thought it would be good
for him.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.778
Look, the way I know him,

25:18.821 --> 25:21.563
he wasn't a chaplain
at the hospital.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.261
He was a patient
in long-term care.

25:24.305 --> 25:25.698
- Oh.

25:25.741 --> 25:28.788
- Car blew a tire
and it hit him head on.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.311
It was one of those
freak accidents.

25:30.354 --> 25:32.792
No one's fault,
but his best friend was driving

25:32.835 --> 25:34.445
and didn't make it.

25:34.489 --> 25:37.710
Kyle underwent multiple
surgeries, months of rehab--

25:37.753 --> 25:40.800
it was touch and go
there for a minute.

25:40.843 --> 25:43.846
Became a chaplain after that.
Figured he got a second chance

25:43.890 --> 25:46.327
and just could help others
find their way.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.111
Look...

25:48.155 --> 25:49.722
I know I haven't known you
that long,

25:49.765 --> 25:51.680
and I definitely don't mean
to overstep.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.465
I just think...

25:54.509 --> 25:57.904
he could use someone
like you in his life.

26:12.353 --> 26:15.051
- Definitely let me know how

she answer the door
