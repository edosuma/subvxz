You don't tell me anything, Erwin.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.130

I couldn't get a word in.

with me two seconds ago.

Hey, I just want you to know
you're right, Nadine.

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.527
- Darian, we don't need to do this...
- You're right about everything!

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.120
I don't give a shit about you.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.649
I'm only here for me,
and my life is fuckin' incredible.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.441
I love it.

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.880
No, I love spending another night
talking Mom off the ledge.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.640
I love only applying to schools nearby

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.440
because who knows what'll happen
in the house if I'm not around to fix it?

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.490
And I love that the one person
who makes me feel

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.204
like I could take a fuckin' breath,

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.725
I can't have without
completely destroying you.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.090
So, you're right.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.248

But I think we both know
what needs to be said right now,

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.962
so I'm just gonna come
right out and say it.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.845

Hey.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.402
Look, I just wanted to say that

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.483
I'm sorry for being a bitch tonight.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.086
For the past couple weeks.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.408
And the past 17 years before that.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.280
I know this isn't any easier for you.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.521
I know that.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.361
I think some deranged
part of me likes thinking

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.006
I'm the only one with real problems.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.330
Like that makes me special.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.442
You know, ever since we were little,
I would get this feeling like...

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:23.770
Like I'm floating outside of my body,
looking down on myself.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.367
And I hate what I see.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.801
How I'm acting, the way I sound.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.920
And I don't know how to change it.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.727
And I'm so scared

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.724
that that feeling is never gonna go away.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.569
I'm sorry.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.531
Really.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.005
Good night.
