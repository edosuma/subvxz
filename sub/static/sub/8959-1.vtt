03:41.073 --> 03:43.008
<i>Help me.</i>

03:43.009 --> 03:45.061
<i>Help me.</i>

03:45.861 --> 03:48.763
<i>Up here. Look up here.</i>

03:51.302 --> 03:53.269
<i>Help me.</i>

03:55.473 --> 03:59.759
<i>You've got to find it.
It's after me.</i>

04:03.750 --> 04:07.252
<i>You've got to get back and find it.</i>

04:07.253 --> 04:09.521
<i>You've got to stop it.</i>

04:09.522 --> 04:14.779
<i>Please, help me. You've
got to help me. Please.</i>

04:16.415 --> 04:21.587
Nice little pussycat, yeah. You're
gonna save me a trip to the pound.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.458
What are you so excited about, huh?

04:24.759 --> 04:27.627
What am I, a cat psychologist?

04:52.190 --> 04:54.860
- Well, this is the place.
- I don't know about this, Jim.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.897
- You said you wanted to quit these.
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

04:57.898 --> 05:02.402
- But I'd just like to know what they...
- Go on, Dickie, before you lose your guts.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.639
Well, why don't you come
up with me at least?

05:04.640 --> 05:07.175
It doesn't work that way.
Against the rules.

05:07.176 --> 05:11.580
What is this? A quit-smoking
clinic or the CIA?

05:12.581 --> 05:16.586
It's gonna turn your life
around, Dick. I guarantee it.

05:16.587 --> 05:19.523
That's what Jim Jones said
when he spiked the punch.

05:45.872 --> 05:48.842
I guess this is where you
come to quit smoking, right?

05:48.843 --> 05:51.577
- Fill one of these out, please.
- No, no. I have a pen.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.733
Honey!

07:10.021 --> 07:11.790
Are you all right?

07:12.826 --> 07:14.694
Sweetheart.

07:17.229 --> 07:20.400
Darling. No, no, no!

07:20.401 --> 07:22.486
Precious. My precious.

07:22.487 --> 07:25.042
- It's all right. You're gonna be fine.
- Take me home.

07:25.043 --> 07:29.645
Home? I'll take you
home. Hang onto me.

07:30.646 --> 07:32.582
I've been a smoker
for a long time...

07:32.583 --> 07:37.489
Since I was sixteen.
It is very hard.

07:37.490 --> 07:41.776
Uh, come on, now. Here.
Come on. OK.

07:41.777 --> 07:46.082
The elevator is down here.
One step at a time.

07:49.654 --> 07:51.656
- Hi. Excuse me.
- I'll take that for you.

07:51.657 --> 07:54.192
Well, you know, actually,
I think I've changed my mind.

07:54.493 --> 07:56.494
- Mr. Morrison?
- Yeah? Yes?

07:56.495 --> 07:58.664
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No, really. It's all right.

07:58.665 --> 08:00.899
- I was just saying...
- Come with me.

08:00.900 --> 08:04.337
- We're about to change your life.
- For the better, I hope.

08:10.411 --> 08:14.281
- The founding father?
- Please, Mr. Morrison.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.220
I see you have a daughter who's 10.

08:31.821 --> 08:33.922
Uh... Alicia.

08:35.023 --> 08:37.827
You left the space for
her school blank.

08:38.128 --> 08:41.565
Where my daughter goes to school really
has no connection with whether or not

08:41.566 --> 08:44.435
your organization can help me
to quit smoking, Mr. Donatti.

08:46.756 --> 08:49.090
Ahem. So...

08:49.991 --> 08:54.631
- Are we gonna get down to it or not?
- Yes, of course.

08:55.132 --> 08:58.435
In fact, we've already
started getting down to it.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.160
Do you have cigarettes with you?

09:08.031 --> 09:10.635
Does a bear shit in the woods?

09:11.436 --> 09:13.803
May I have them, please?

09:53.001 --> 09:57.572
Our methods here at quitters incorporated
are rather radical, Mr. Morrison.

09:57.573 --> 10:01.144
Well, as a treatment,
Mr. Donatti, they suck.

10:01.145 --> 10:03.891
There's a newsstand down in
the lobby. They sell all brands.

10:03.917 --> 10:07.569
- You know what I mean?
- Availability is only part of the problem.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.072
The fall-back rate
for reformed smokers

10:10.098 --> 10:12.574
is higher than the fall-back
rate for heroin addicts.

10:12.575 --> 10:14.577
You can spare me the <i>Reader's
Digest</i> lecture, my friend,

10:14.578 --> 10:17.546
because... I've changed my mind.

10:20.634 --> 10:22.669
Will you open this door?

10:22.670 --> 10:24.739
You've got a hell of a
problem, Mr. Morrison,

10:24.740 --> 10:27.726
but we here at quitters incorporated
have developed a hell of a solution.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.828
Look, you're gonna develop a hell
of a problem with my lawyers

10:29.829 --> 10:31.863
if you don't open
this goddamn door!

10:34.684 --> 10:36.719
Relax, Mr. Morrison.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.890
Here's something that
might interest you.

10:44.396 --> 10:48.217
Watch closely, Mr. Morrison.
Nothing up either sleeve.

10:48.218 --> 10:52.590
And you'll notice at no time
does my hand leave my wrist.

10:58.496 --> 11:01.552
- The music is part of his conditioning.
<i>- Shake it up, baby</i>

11:01.584 --> 11:04.509
<i>Shake it up, baby
Twist and shout</i>

11:04.604 --> 11:06.972
Boogie down, baby.

11:07.073 --> 11:10.510
<i>Come on, baby
Come on, baby</i>

11:10.511 --> 11:14.149
<i>Come on and work it on out
Come on and work it on out</i>

11:14.250 --> 11:17.935
<i>Yeah, work it on out, honey
Work it on out</i>

11:17.936 --> 11:20.924
<i>Yeah, you look so good
Yeah, you look so good</i>

11:20.925 --> 11:24.478
What are you doing?
Stop it. You're killing him!

11:25.579 --> 11:29.783
Kill the nice kitty?
No, no. He's fine.

11:29.784 --> 11:34.589
Maybe a little crispy around the
paws, but otherwise, he's fine.

11:36.426 --> 11:40.061
Damn it. You barbecue
all the cats you want.

11:40.062 --> 11:42.215
If you don't have me out of
here inside of 15 seconds

11:42.216 --> 11:45.620
I'm gonna call the cops on you faster
than you can say Marlboro man.

11:46.621 --> 11:49.658
You better listen to the
big picture, Mr. Morrison.

11:49.659 --> 11:53.629
Quitters incorporated was endowed
by a very important person.

11:53.630 --> 11:57.750
After he died of lung cancer, we realized
that there were certain techniques

11:57.751 --> 11:59.670
that he had developed
in the family business

11:59.671 --> 12:02.188
that we can now use to
stop people from smoking.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.693
Actually, this is a
very nice tax gimmick.

12:05.694 --> 12:10.064
But mainly, we're interested
in helping our fellow man.

12:10.065 --> 12:13.971
For the first month, our operatives will
have you under constant supervision.

12:13.972 --> 12:19.010
You may see some of them all of the time.
You may see all of them some of the time.

12:19.011 --> 12:24.083
But believe me, Mr. Morrison, you'll
never see all of them all of the time.

12:24.284 --> 12:27.752
If you smoke, they'll see you.

12:28.753 --> 12:32.293
And bring me down here and stick
me in the old cat room, I suppose.

12:32.294 --> 12:38.065
No... We'll bring your wife down
here and stick her in the cat room.

12:38.066 --> 12:39.933
You'll get to watch.

12:41.937 --> 12:43.771
<i>I'm a man of medicine.</i>

12:43.772 --> 12:49.643
<i>I'm expected to save lives and
ease suffering, and I love people.</i>

12:50.369 --> 12:55.445
<i>Therefore, I would have no choice...
but to kill the son of a bitch.</i>

12:55.821 --> 12:57.872
Kill the son of a bitch. Good idea.

12:57.873 --> 13:00.576
- What did you say?
- What?

13:00.577 --> 13:03.946
- Huh?
- Nothing. I was...

13:05.883 --> 13:09.720
<i>- I can't believe this is happening.
- Oh, it's happening, Mr. Morrison.</i>

13:09.721 --> 13:11.905
<i>First offense, your
wife gets the juice.</i>

13:11.906 --> 13:14.409
<i>Not too much. Just enough to hurt.</i>

13:14.410 --> 13:17.412
<i>Second time, we bring your
daughter Alicia here.</i>

13:17.413 --> 13:21.817
<i>Imagine, Mr. Morrison, your daughter
in there instead of the cat.</i>

13:21.818 --> 13:26.207
<i>The third offense, I'm afraid I have
to send someone out to rape your wife.</i>

13:26.208 --> 13:28.476
<i>There's a rather disturbed
individual we keep around here</i>

13:28.477 --> 13:31.313
<i>just for such distasteful jobs.</i>

13:32.214 --> 13:36.886
<i>In the meantime, content yourself
knowing that only 2% of our clients</i>

13:36.887 --> 13:39.557
<i>ever fall from grace a fourth time.</i>

13:40.558 --> 13:42.628
<i>And if they do?</i>

13:43.729 --> 13:46.797
<i>Then we give up, Mr. Morrison.</i>

13:50.470 --> 13:52.805
- Oh, God... God!
- What's wrong?

13:52.806 --> 13:55.780
- Well, I spilled my drink!
- Well, I'm sorry, Dick...

13:55.806 --> 13:59.247
but as long as you keep using your left
tit for a coaster, that's gonna happen.

13:59.248 --> 14:01.716
Shit! I have no idea what's going
on in this damn movie anyway.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.819
I don't know who writes this crap!

14:14.497 --> 14:16.700
- Dick.
- What?

14:16.901 --> 14:19.504
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

14:19.505 --> 14:22.007
You're like a bear
tonight. What is it?

14:22.008 --> 14:25.978
It's nothing! Well, it's everything.
I mean, I quit smoking today.

14:26.579 --> 14:29.533
Since when? Five minutes ago?

14:29.534 --> 14:32.035
Since 3:00... quarter
to 3:00 this afternoon.

14:32.036 --> 14:34.539
You haven't had a
cigarette in six hours?

14:34.540 --> 14:38.543
Uh, 6 hours and 23 minutes.

14:38.544 --> 14:42.348
Cindy, I'm trying to get
some ice cream here, OK?

14:43.495 --> 14:46.298
What in the world made
you decide to quit?

14:46.553 --> 14:50.924
I'm doing it for you...
and for Alicia.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.564
That's the sweetest
thing I ever heard.

14:55.565 --> 14:59.170
Even if you don't make it,
we both thank you.

15:01.571 --> 15:03.439
I think I'll make it.

15:52.283 --> 15:53.916
Shit!

16:07.285 --> 16:10.287
Jesus! God!

18:08.094 --> 18:09.629
Hello.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.087
Is somebody in there?

18:18.425 --> 18:20.726
I didn't smoke it, see?

18:21.727 --> 18:27.135
If you're in there, would you tell
Donatti that I didn't smoke it, see?

18:28.036 --> 18:33.941
I actually was just, uh...
coming to get my golf clubs.

19:57.945 --> 20:00.846
- Want some coffee?
- Jesus!

20:00.847 --> 20:03.550
I assume that's a yes.

20:05.451 --> 20:08.188
Talk about aversion therapy.

20:10.425 --> 20:12.293
Jesus.

20:14.230 --> 20:16.298
That's it. That's it.

20:49.022 --> 20:51.023
Daddy!

20:52.091 --> 20:55.261
Hi, baby. Whoa!

20:57.081 --> 21:02.587
OK, eyes closed and there we go! OK,
now, we're skipping with eyes closed.

21:04.588 --> 21:07.092
We're gonna skip over to...

21:07.093 --> 21:10.135
Here. Are those eyes closed?
Are they closed?

21:10.161 --> 21:12.020
I think they're open.
Are they closed?

21:12.046 --> 21:13.600
- Are they real tight?
- Yeah.

21:13.601 --> 21:16.604
We don't want to spoil
any surprises, OK.

21:16.605 --> 21:19.240
I think now it's time to open them.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.477
Ah.

21:25.115 --> 21:26.741
Thank you, daddy!

21:26.767 --> 21:30.487
- Thank you! Thank you!
- OK, I'm glad you like it, honey.

21:30.488 --> 21:35.127
You know what? I love you, Alicia.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.230
- What's its name?
- His name...

21:38.231 --> 21:43.636
I think it's right here on the tag.
Its name is Norma Jean.

21:43.637 --> 21:46.139
- Nor-ma...
- Norma...

21:46.140 --> 21:48.442
- Jean.
- Jean.

21:48.443 --> 21:49.643
Huh?

21:49.644 --> 21:52.915
I love Norma Jean!

21:53.716 --> 21:55.682
I'm glad, baby.

21:59.656 --> 22:03.593
OK, honey, come on. You got
Norma Jean, you got her shoe,

22:03.594 --> 22:07.165
and you got her little adoption papers.
Look after the kid and be a good girl, OK?

22:07.166 --> 22:08.734
Sister?

22:09.235 --> 22:10.668
OK, bye, honey.

22:10.669 --> 22:13.688
- Bye.
- Bye, dad.

22:14.689 --> 22:16.192
You love her a lot, don't you?

22:16.193 --> 22:19.029
One of your men was in my
closet last night, in my home!

22:19.030 --> 22:20.197
- Really?
- Yes, really.

22:20.198 --> 22:22.599
That's possible, I suppose.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.805
Constant supervision for the
first month is what we promise.

22:26.806 --> 22:29.407
Constant supervision is
just what the client gets.

22:29.408 --> 22:32.711
- You're a son of a bitch.
- Yes, I'm a son of a bitch.

22:32.712 --> 22:35.448
It takes a son of bitch
to beat the habit.

22:35.449 --> 22:39.854
People who are unable to turn into sons of
bitches on their own behalf, come to us.

22:39.955 --> 22:42.991
We give them what they
need. Believe me, we do.

22:42.992 --> 22:46.995
I didn't smoke. I don't know what your
hoods told you, but I didn't smoke!

22:46.996 --> 22:50.950
If you had lit that cigarette in your
mouth, you wouldn't be here right now.

22:50.951 --> 22:55.455
You'd be down at my office watching your
wife hop around in the little room.

22:55.456 --> 23:01.762
You love your wife, you love your kid,
unfashionable these days, but useful.

23:01.763 --> 23:06.368
I think you're gonna make it,
Mr. Morrison. We'll be watching you.

23:30.982 --> 23:34.386
<i>Every breath you take</i>

23:34.787 --> 23:38.089
<i>Every move you make</i>

23:38.759 --> 23:40.993
<i>Every bond you break</i>

23:40.994 --> 23:45.031
<i>Every step you take
I'll be watching you</i>

23:45.032 --> 23:47.234
An asshole like me
could stay in business.

23:47.235 --> 23:51.808
I said it wasn't easy, but with
assholes like him around, I got by.

23:53.009 --> 23:54.242
Not bad, huh?

23:54.243 --> 23:55.877
No. Not bad at all.
Can I get a bourbon?

23:55.878 --> 24:01.183
So he says, "what do you think the S.E.C.'s
gonna say when they hear about this?"

24:08.846 --> 24:12.550
Two things... First they're gonna
say they heard it all before.

24:12.551 --> 24:16.554
Second, they're gonna say
P.T. Barnum was right.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.923
There's a sucker born every minute.

24:26.782 --> 24:30.586
Earth to Dick. Earth to Dick
Morrison. Come in, Dick!

24:30.587 --> 24:33.589
I'm sorry. I'm just a little tired.
Kind of under the weather.

24:33.590 --> 24:37.994
- Have a cigarette.
- Yeah... no! Thanks. Sorry. I quit.

24:37.995 --> 24:40.081
I did, really.

24:41.082 --> 24:42.383
Sure.

24:42.884 --> 24:44.853
No. Two weeks ago. Done.

24:44.854 --> 24:49.226
Two weeks, two months,
two years. It doesn't matter.

24:49.227 --> 24:53.098
A big presentation comes along,
a make-or-break meeting,

24:53.099 --> 24:58.988
a marathon sales conference...
boom, you'll be right back on it.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.890
Come on. Have a cigarette.

25:08.115 --> 25:11.286
Come on. Have a cigarette!

25:12.087 --> 25:14.524
No, really. I gave those babies up.

25:18.996 --> 25:24.884
Hey, gang! The smoking
lamp is lit again!

25:25.687 --> 25:28.606
<i>Every word you say</i>

25:29.542 --> 25:31.610
<i>Every game you play</i>

25:31.611 --> 25:33.646
<i>Every night you stay</i>

25:33.647 --> 25:36.115
<i>I'll be watching you</i>

25:38.186 --> 25:41.487
<i>Oh, can't you see</i>

25:42.113 --> 25:45.801
<i>You belong to me?</i>

25:45.877 --> 25:46.775
Dickie.

25:46.801 --> 25:50.365
Why don't you shove
it up your ass, Hal.

25:50.366 --> 25:54.036
<i>Every step you take</i>

25:54.337 --> 25:56.939
What? Lit?

28:24.685 --> 28:26.068
Shit!

29:00.895 --> 29:02.528
Cindy!

29:09.204 --> 29:10.472
Cindy!

29:10.473 --> 29:13.308
Cindy! Cindy!

29:13.877 --> 29:15.745
Cindy!

29:19.049 --> 29:20.351
Cindy!

29:28.462 --> 29:29.628
Cindy?

29:29.829 --> 29:31.264
Hello, Mr. Morrison.

29:31.765 --> 29:36.470
It seems we have some business to
attend to. Will 5:00 be all right?

29:36.471 --> 29:40.676
You know, it was just a slip, Mr. Donatti.
It was just a little, small slip.

29:40.677 --> 29:43.679
You know? I mean... really,
I swear it won't happen again.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.382
You know, it's funny...
it didn't even taste good.

29:46.383 --> 29:49.067
I'll count on you
for 5:00, shall I?

29:49.068 --> 29:53.556
No, no! Donatti! Donatti!
You son of a bitch!

29:55.094 --> 29:56.760
You son of a bitch!

29:56.761 --> 29:59.432
- Where's my wife, you turd?!
- Hello, Mr. Morrison.

29:59.433 --> 30:02.901
He tried to get smart with his fists, but
unfortunately, he's got very dumb fists.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.905
Where's Cindy?

30:20.544 --> 30:22.547
Don't, you idiot!

30:32.689 --> 30:34.522
Oh, fiddlysticks!

30:35.708 --> 30:38.211
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty! Here, kitty!

30:38.512 --> 30:39.812
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

30:39.913 --> 30:43.818
Forget the cat, you
hemorrhoid! Get the gun!

30:44.519 --> 30:49.173
Get up, Mr. Morrison. Let's not
have any more of this foolishness.

30:56.617 --> 30:57.750
Open the door!

30:57.751 --> 31:01.572
I understand your agitation.
It will not be held against you,

31:01.573 --> 31:04.308
- at least not by me.
- Please, Mr. Donatti, please!

31:04.309 --> 31:08.195
You be a good boy, Mr. Morrison,
and don't provoke Junk again.

31:08.596 --> 31:13.670
I will make this as brief as possible.
Your wife will not be hurt this time.

31:14.271 --> 31:16.572
Watch him, Junk.

31:28.906 --> 31:30.807
<i>Too many teardrops</i>

31:30.808 --> 31:32.743
<i>For one heart</i>

31:32.744 --> 31:34.628
<i>To be cryin'</i>

31:36.565 --> 31:38.749
<i>Too many teardrops</i>

31:38.750 --> 31:40.435
<i>For one heart</i>

31:40.436 --> 31:41.253
<i>To carry on</i>

31:41.254 --> 31:43.855
Remember, it just like getting
a shot at the doctor's office.

31:43.856 --> 31:45.893
<i>You're way out on top now</i>

31:47.913 --> 31:50.079
<i>Since you left me</i>

31:51.116 --> 31:53.451
<i>You're always laughin'</i>

31:53.452 --> 31:55.219
Ow! Stop!

31:55.220 --> 31:57.522
<i>Way down at me</i>

31:58.958 --> 32:01.226
<i>But watch out, now</i>

32:02.729 --> 32:04.980
<i>I'm gonna get there</i>

32:06.384 --> 32:08.469
<i>We'll be together</i>

32:10.590 --> 32:12.590
Stop it! Would you stop it?
You're killing her!

32:12.591 --> 32:15.962
Take it easy, Mr. Morrison.
She'll be fine.

32:18.132 --> 32:20.232
<i>Way down here...</i>

32:36.538 --> 32:40.306
I think you've got some
explaining to do, don't you?

32:53.023 --> 32:55.225
Hey, boss, ain't you
gonna turn the sound up?

32:55.426 --> 32:57.159
There's no reason to.

32:57.160 --> 33:01.198
When you been in the business as long
as I have, you get to know every line.

33:01.199 --> 33:05.170
In 30 seconds, she's either gonna squeeze
this guy hard enough to give him a hernia,

33:05.171 --> 33:08.276
or she's gonna slap him
in the face and walk out.

33:10.777 --> 33:13.545
- 10 bucks says she slaps him.
- You're on.

33:16.584 --> 33:18.519
Oh, darn.

33:51.559 --> 33:54.062
- No, back about there.
- No, no.

33:54.063 --> 33:55.864
- See, look.
- No, no.

33:55.865 --> 33:59.301
No, that's eight pounds in six months,
Vinnie. I don't think that's so bad really.

33:59.302 --> 34:01.938
An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure. We gotta watch it.

34:01.939 --> 34:05.943
73% of our clients get a weight
problem the minute they quit smoking.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.437
Now, I want you to get dressed,
and you and I will have a talk.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.871
- You gotta watch it.
- OK.

34:09.947 --> 34:12.217
Junk, you think eight pounds
is bad in six months?

34:12.217 --> 34:14.020
I think it's great.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.208
So remember, now, some of
these diet pills are highly illegal

34:18.208 --> 34:20.143
so I want you to
use them sparingly.

34:20.145 --> 34:23.347
Now I'm setting your maximum
weight at 165 pounds.

34:23.848 --> 34:27.619
If I go over it, you'll send a guy to my
house with a flamethrower or something?

34:27.820 --> 34:31.657
No, I'll send a guy to your house and
cut off your wife's little finger.

34:31.658 --> 34:32.491
You kill me.

34:32.492 --> 34:34.694
- Have a good day, Dick.
- Take it easy, huh?

34:35.094 --> 34:36.996
Cut off my wife's little finger.

34:36.998 --> 34:39.032
Sorry to keep you waiting.

34:44.139 --> 34:47.076
I think a toast is in order.
A toast is in order.

34:47.677 --> 34:50.280
OK, no throwing the glasses
in the fireplace, though.

34:50.281 --> 34:51.917
- We don't want to wake Alicia.
- The ladies are entitled...

34:51.918 --> 34:54.719
The ladies are entitled to throw
glasses in the fireplace.

34:55.420 --> 34:56.853
To quitters incorporated.

34:56.853 --> 34:59.041
Quitters incorporated.

34:59.742 --> 35:01.710
Quitters incorporated.

35:05.348 --> 35:07.417
To quitters incorporated.

35:33.015 --> 35:37.103
Beat it! Go on! Scat! Go on! Scat!

36:09.893 --> 36:13.828
<i>Come on, Darcy. It's gobbler time.</i>

36:17.185 --> 36:19.704
<i>Now you just sit right there.</i>

36:19.705 --> 36:25.027
<i>Gobblers is all that Darcy eats because
it's her mostest, mostest favorite.</i>

36:28.415 --> 36:31.935
<i>Listen to me carefully.
It's still looking for me.</i>

36:31.936 --> 36:34.672
<i>You've got to get back and find it.</i>

36:37.225 --> 36:41.696
<i>You're my only chance.
You're my only chance.</i>

36:43.633 --> 36:47.588
- Lucky night, Mr. Cressner.
- Don't jump to any conclusions.

36:47.589 --> 36:49.423
The night ain't all lucky.

36:50.224 --> 36:52.393
- Good night, Mr. Cressner.
- Good night, sweetheart.

36:52.394 --> 36:53.895
- Richards!
- Yeah, boss?

36:53.896 --> 36:56.098
- Cash these.
- OK. You got it.

36:59.435 --> 37:03.039
<i>- Buona notte,</i> Mr. Cressner.
<i>- Buona notte. Buona notte.</i>

37:03.040 --> 37:05.341
Oh, so nice, Mr. Cressner.
Thank you.

37:05.442 --> 37:07.946
- Good night, Mr. C.
- Good night, Henry.

37:10.470 --> 37:13.451
- Hey, have you spoke to Ducky?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Cressner.

37:13.452 --> 37:15.954
He's got my wife and
her friend in view?

37:15.955 --> 37:18.958
Yes, sir, she and the tennis guy are
in a white mustang convertible.

37:18.959 --> 37:20.761
Ducky's right on 'em.
He's right behind 'em.

37:20.762 --> 37:23.732
Good, good, good, good. Good man.

37:24.333 --> 37:27.302
So, folks, what's it gonna be?

37:27.303 --> 37:28.904
Dean Martin's at the golden nugget,

37:28.905 --> 37:32.408
and I haven't seen Dino Martino
since I was a little girl.

37:32.609 --> 37:34.276
Have you taken care of
your domestic problem?

37:34.277 --> 37:36.285
- I got everything well in hand.
- Good.

37:36.311 --> 37:38.048
The golden nugget will be fine, OK?

37:38.049 --> 37:40.350
- Oh, good. Thank you so much.
- OK. Let's go.

37:42.837 --> 37:45.572
Oh, my gosh. Look at that... a cat.

37:57.722 --> 37:59.090
You know, my daddy used to say

37:59.091 --> 38:02.426
that all cats should be drowned, after
they stop playing with spools and stuff?

38:02.427 --> 38:03.595
Is that what your daddy said?

38:03.596 --> 38:05.797
Your father must have been
a great humanitarian.

38:11.288 --> 38:14.075
Oh, my gosh, I bet that
cat's gonna get run over.

38:14.076 --> 38:16.176
I got 2,000 says he can make it.

38:16.177 --> 38:17.550
- You're kidding?
- No.

38:17.576 --> 38:19.865
- You're on.
- 2,000 that he can make it.

38:19.866 --> 38:22.668
- Cat's dead. You're on.
- Here you go.

38:22.669 --> 38:24.286
You say he makes it,
I say he's dead.

38:24.287 --> 38:26.521
- Yeah, all right.
- I can do anything I want?

38:26.522 --> 38:29.543
- Sure, so can I. Anybody can.
- I can do anything I want?

38:29.544 --> 38:30.911
- You won't say a word?
- Go ahead. Yeah.

38:30.912 --> 38:33.614
- You got it. Watch.
- Anybody can do anything they want.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.451
- Watch me.
- I'm watching.

38:35.452 --> 38:38.712
Come on, cat. Come
here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

38:38.738 --> 38:41.790
Come on, kitty, kitty.
Come on, little kitty, kitty.

38:41.791 --> 38:46.064
- You guys would bet on anything.
- Yeah. That's what it's all about.

38:46.065 --> 38:49.017
Come on, kitty, kitty.
Come here, little kitty.

38:49.018 --> 38:53.121
- Come on, little kitty. Come on.
- Come here, kitty. Come here, kitty.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.158
- For 2,000, you're on my side now?
- Yeah.

38:55.159 --> 38:57.728
You're the one whose father
was drownin' cats, remember?

38:57.753 --> 39:00.863
- Come on, kitty. Come to mama.
- Come on. kitty. Come on, kitty.

39:02.049 --> 39:04.385
Don't worry about these big
things. That's special effects.

39:04.386 --> 39:06.971
- Come on, kitty.
- Here, kitty.

39:07.072 --> 39:10.019
OK, OK. OK, OK.

39:10.044 --> 39:12.666
OK, OK, OK. OK!

39:12.767 --> 39:15.214
Now! Come on.

39:15.215 --> 39:17.550
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

39:22.256 --> 39:25.477
- Come on!
- Come on, kitty, kitty.

39:29.030 --> 39:32.368
Hey, there he is. There he is.

39:32.402 --> 39:36.706
Yeah, there's the guy.
There's the guy. Look at him.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.408
He was just lucky.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.911
Lucky? I think he knows
you bet against him.

39:40.912 --> 39:43.415
You win some, you lose some.

39:43.916 --> 39:46.918
You guys go on. Go see Dean Martin.

39:46.919 --> 39:51.458
I'll take this guy home, give him a bowl
of milk. I think he just earned it.

39:51.459 --> 39:53.927
- Good-bye, sweetheart.
- You sure you're not coming?

39:53.928 --> 39:55.931
I got to finish that business
I was talking about.

39:55.932 --> 39:57.331
Right. OK.

39:57.332 --> 39:59.434
- You wanna get me a cab, please.
- Have a good time.

40:03.135 --> 40:07.409
Get Ducky on the radio.
Tell him to nail the bastard.

40:07.610 --> 40:08.978
Good night.

40:09.647 --> 40:10.671
Thanks.

40:10.697 --> 40:13.450
Thank you. I still don't see
why you can't come with me.

40:13.451 --> 40:16.954
Because we're broke. If you
decided to leave with me,

40:16.955 --> 40:20.559
you'd be sent into a whole new plane
of financial existence, my dear.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.963
I'm just trying to... make the
decompression as painless as possible.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.846
- I don't care.
- But I do.

40:25.872 --> 40:27.482
The Armbruster Hotel in New York.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.403
- I'll see you there tomorrow night.
- Johnny...

40:29.404 --> 40:32.406
I've got to wait till the banks open, so
I can crack open one of my piggy banks

40:32.407 --> 40:35.110
to get us some money. We gotta
have something to live on.

40:35.111 --> 40:37.296
Look, Johnny, you don't
know how dangerous he is.

40:37.297 --> 40:40.467
- You don't even have a clue.
- I know exactly what he is.

40:40.468 --> 40:44.872
And that's why you're getting on
the bus, after you give me a kiss.

40:45.273 --> 40:50.979
<i>All passengers bound for Philadelphia, New
Hope, and Harrisburg, please report to...</i>

40:51.380 --> 40:53.183
- Johnny.
- Go.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.352
<i>All passengers for Philadelphia...</i>

41:16.276 --> 41:17.894
Hey!

41:17.895 --> 41:23.466
It's for horses, sometimes for cows. Pigs
don't eat it 'cause they don't know how.

41:24.253 --> 41:25.970
Get him.

41:28.408 --> 41:30.911
Get his keys, Dom. Come on.

41:31.912 --> 41:35.948
You're in grade-A trouble,
buckaroo. Come on. Move. Move!

41:36.867 --> 41:38.668
Come on.

41:42.908 --> 41:44.475
Come on!

42:11.342 --> 42:13.244
OK, blow.

42:13.945 --> 42:17.147
- Come on, kid.
- Hey!

42:17.148 --> 42:20.302
Pigs don't eat it 'cause
they don't know how.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.607
When Ducky says that,
it means shut up.

42:24.808 --> 42:28.779
- Does it?
- Yeah. It's like a joke, you know?

42:51.974 --> 42:53.942
Close the door, close the door.

43:05.674 --> 43:08.276
I've set you up, Mr. Norris.

43:08.277 --> 43:11.381
In 10 minutes, Albert
will call the police

43:11.382 --> 43:16.887
and tell them a tale of
heroin, 1970 mustangs...

43:17.088 --> 43:22.596
aging tennis pros with drug records.
You'll be eagerly sought after, Mr. Norris.

43:22.597 --> 43:25.099
Unless I tell you where Marcia is.

43:26.800 --> 43:32.006
With you gone, she'd come back.
She's got nowhere else to go.

43:32.407 --> 43:35.210
Now as for you, when
you get out of jail...

43:35.211 --> 43:39.581
you'll be more concerned with
your arthritis than your libido.

43:40.820 --> 43:46.629
Unless you take the wager
I'm offering. Hmm?

43:49.027 --> 43:51.396
Hey, come here.

43:55.835 --> 43:57.353
Come on.

43:58.654 --> 44:00.722
I want to show you something.

44:11.240 --> 44:16.340
Now look down there, and tell me
what you see. Look. Go ahead.

44:19.062 --> 44:22.934
- The street.
- No. There, there.

44:23.635 --> 44:24.535
The ledge.

44:24.536 --> 44:27.672
- The ledge.
- Look, what is all this about?

44:29.273 --> 44:32.176
The wager I'm proposing
is very simple.

44:32.177 --> 44:37.351
The top of the building is sort of
an architectural monstrosity...

44:37.352 --> 44:42.607
All little nooks,
crannies, weird winds.

44:43.508 --> 44:48.296
You walk all the way around, scab
will be removed from the car,

44:48.297 --> 44:51.801
you get the money,
and you get my wife.

44:51.802 --> 44:53.703
You're crazy.

44:55.404 --> 44:59.077
Lose your balance, lose
your balance once...

45:15.245 --> 45:17.715
That's the bet, Mr. Norris.

45:17.716 --> 45:21.887
You get the girl, you get the
gold watch, you get everything.

45:21.888 --> 45:25.107
Or you get a lot of straight
time in Rahway Prison.

45:52.773 --> 45:54.942
You welsh on your bets?

45:57.779 --> 46:00.651
I've never welshed
on a bet in my life.

46:05.290 --> 46:08.292
Hey, Sebastian. Hey, Sebastian.

46:08.293 --> 46:13.063
Sebastian appears to like you.
Maybe that's a good sign, huh?

46:13.700 --> 46:15.066
Huh?

46:23.529 --> 46:27.599
Good. Good. Well
begun is half done.

46:53.263 --> 46:56.533
The ledge is about 5 inches wide.

46:56.534 --> 47:00.538
But once you're on it, it looks
more like 3, doesn't it?

47:00.539 --> 47:03.909
Or two. two, yeah.

47:04.478 --> 47:05.878
One?

47:06.279 --> 47:09.015
How the hell would you know?

47:10.418 --> 47:13.486
Mr. Norris, you know what I think?

47:13.687 --> 47:18.993
I think you're gonna just stand there
for a while, then climb back up, huh?

47:18.994 --> 47:23.099
I mean if your arms still got
the strength left to do that.

47:23.100 --> 47:28.805
I... don't think you got the guts.
I just don't think you got the guts.

47:52.819 --> 47:55.337
Boogie! Boogie! Boogie!

47:58.643 --> 48:00.293
You bastard!

48:00.295 --> 48:02.929
I just want to keep
you on your toes.

48:03.130 --> 48:05.933
Ha ha ha!

48:20.952 --> 48:22.970
Oh, get out of here.

50:02.208 --> 50:04.074
Boingo.

50:17.542 --> 50:19.543
You bastard!

50:19.845 --> 50:22.915
Just keeping you on your toes!

50:36.099 --> 50:38.200
Oh, Jesus.

51:00.143 --> 51:04.581
Hey, what's the matter with you? Knock it
off, huh? Where's your sense of humor?

51:29.329 --> 51:31.179
Hey.

51:33.767 --> 51:35.367
Buzz off.

51:36.770 --> 51:38.271
Hey!

51:46.249 --> 51:47.782
Shove off.

51:48.183 --> 51:49.284
Ow!

51:51.788 --> 51:54.074
Ow!

51:54.675 --> 51:56.960
Oh!

52:01.684 --> 52:03.351
God.

52:07.841 --> 52:09.875
Oh, God!

52:12.563 --> 52:14.865
Ow, you little pecker.

52:50.358 --> 52:52.360
Try this, you...

52:52.361 --> 52:54.729
You flying shithouse.

53:04.877 --> 53:06.877
Mr. Norris!

53:20.144 --> 53:22.247
What do you think, Mr. Norris?

53:22.248 --> 53:26.786
Is this more fun than human beings
should be allowed to have, or what?

53:26.887 --> 53:30.089
- I'll kill you!
- No, Mr. Norris.

53:30.090 --> 53:35.228
But I will most assuredly kill you if
you don't get moving in 30 seconds.

53:36.029 --> 53:38.632
The valve was only
half-open that time.

53:38.633 --> 53:44.422
If I open it all the way, I'll
blow you out of this hole. Move!

53:45.960 --> 53:47.927
I'll kill you.

53:52.167 --> 53:54.234
I'm going insane.

55:02.050 --> 55:04.902
Oh, God. God!

55:06.205 --> 55:08.423
God!

56:46.273 --> 56:47.976
Put it in the shopping bag.

56:47.977 --> 56:51.580
- On top of the money?
- Put it in the shopping bag.

56:52.581 --> 56:54.616
Put that down.

56:56.017 --> 57:00.808
Now you come in when I say, "all right,
all right, Mr. Norris." You got that?

57:00.809 --> 57:02.706
- Yeah, I got it. "All right, Mr. Norris."
- No, no...

57:02.732 --> 57:05.348
"All right, all right, Mr. Norris."

57:05.349 --> 57:09.319
- I got it. "All right, Mr. Norris."
- Forget it. Go ahead.

57:28.176 --> 57:30.711
All right, all right, Mr. Norris.

57:31.612 --> 57:34.048
I told you I don't welsh.

57:39.022 --> 57:40.594
- No?
- No...

57:40.620 --> 57:43.569
I'm just an extremely poor loser.

57:43.645 --> 57:45.746
I promised you three things...

57:45.747 --> 57:50.586
You have your car clean,
you have the money,

57:50.587 --> 57:52.956
and, of course...

57:52.957 --> 57:55.542
You have <i>my</i> wife.

57:59.013 --> 58:00.814
Jesus!

58:01.248 --> 58:03.016
How do you like that, Mr. Norris?

58:03.217 --> 58:04.601
God!

58:05.215 --> 58:07.917
Albert! Albert!

58:17.567 --> 58:19.437
Albert!

58:24.959 --> 58:27.493
Shit! Shit!

58:35.291 --> 58:39.359
The money... Nothin'. Nothin'.

58:39.360 --> 58:41.463
Chicken feed.

58:41.464 --> 58:45.817
I can get you a 100,000. 500,000.

58:46.720 --> 58:48.855
A million, Norris...

58:49.856 --> 58:54.545
In a Swiss bank account. How
about that? How about that?

58:55.546 --> 58:57.982
A million dollars.

59:02.288 --> 59:04.156
I don't think so.

59:04.157 --> 59:07.527
Two million. Two million!

59:12.867 --> 59:16.154
No. I got an idea.

59:16.155 --> 59:19.024
I'll make you a little
bet. It's not a wager

59:19.025 --> 59:22.494
'cause I'm not a big,
fancy hood like you.

59:22.495 --> 59:26.403
I'm just an over-the-hill
tennis bum...

59:29.204 --> 59:33.909
with a dead girlfriend. Now,
it's just a simple little bet.

59:41.517 --> 59:44.353
Five million. Five million, huh?

59:44.354 --> 59:47.374
I'll give you... I'll give you
anything you want, huh?

59:47.375 --> 59:50.695
You're right, Mr. Cressner.
This is a lot fun.

59:50.696 --> 59:53.143
You got to be joking,
Norris, come on. It's a joke.

59:53.169 --> 59:58.222
Tell me it's a joke. Tell me it's a
joke, for Christ's sake! Don't shoot!

01:00:01.894 --> 01:00:06.663
Just keeping you on your toes,
Mr. Cressner. Keep moving.

01:00:08.267 --> 01:00:10.838
The next one might be a lot closer.

01:00:14.274 --> 01:00:16.009
Move!

01:00:31.912 --> 01:00:35.081
Norris, you son of a bitch!

01:00:52.205 --> 01:00:53.805
Hey!

01:00:54.706 --> 01:00:56.910
Get out of here!

01:00:58.511 --> 01:01:00.613
Get out! Get out!

01:02:22.878 --> 01:02:25.014
Ohhh.

01:02:35.093 --> 01:02:37.595
Don't splash daddy when
daddy's got the hose.

01:02:37.596 --> 01:02:39.883
Come on, you two. Lunch time.

01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:44.189
Let's get some of that soap off.

01:02:50.678 --> 01:02:52.629
A cat!

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.635
Hey!

01:02:59.707 --> 01:03:01.275
Can we keep it? Can we keep it?

01:03:01.276 --> 01:03:04.161
No. He probably belongs
to somebody else.

01:03:04.562 --> 01:03:06.029
Amanda, wait till I get a broom.

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:09.869
Amanda, wait a minute! Amanda!

01:03:16.475 --> 01:03:19.312
Amanda, don't touch that
cat. It could bite you.

01:03:19.313 --> 01:03:21.916
He's not gonna bite
me. It likes me.

01:03:21.917 --> 01:03:24.152
I want to keep... No, don't!

01:03:24.153 --> 01:03:27.590
Amanda, we can't keep every single
stray that comes into this house.

01:03:27.591 --> 01:03:31.109
- It could have disease.
- What if we have the vet check him?

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:34.430
If the vet checks him out and says
there's nothing wrong with him

01:03:34.431 --> 01:03:37.768
and no one comes to get him,
then can we please have him?

01:03:37.769 --> 01:03:41.321
Please? Pretty please
with sugar on top?

01:03:48.865 --> 01:03:51.067
What's your name?

01:03:53.138 --> 01:03:55.406
I can't hear you.

01:03:56.307 --> 01:03:59.810
Gonna guard me? Hope so.

01:04:01.947 --> 01:04:04.900
But, mom, can't General
stay in my room tonight?

01:04:04.901 --> 01:04:06.201
- No.
- Please?

01:04:06.227 --> 01:04:10.072
No. His trial lease in this house
does not include bedroom privileges.

01:04:10.073 --> 01:04:12.910
- But, mom!
- Come on, now. Bedtime.

01:04:12.911 --> 01:04:15.847
Oh, mom. Good night, General.

01:04:45.201 --> 01:04:49.738
Amanda, would you turn off that
TV set? I'd like to talk to you.

01:04:51.139 --> 01:04:54.476
That cat was in your bedroom
last night, wasn't he?

01:04:54.477 --> 01:04:57.847
Uh-huh. I found cat hairs
all over your bedspread,

01:04:57.848 --> 01:05:00.015
and a lot of your dolls
were knocked over.

01:05:00.016 --> 01:05:03.771
Was he? I dreamed he was. Far out.

01:05:03.772 --> 01:05:05.974
Yeah? Well, he's really
gonna be far out

01:05:05.975 --> 01:05:08.911
if that happens again because I'm
gonna send him to the animal shelter.

01:05:08.912 --> 01:05:12.731
But, mom, you can't do
that! That's not fair.

01:05:12.732 --> 01:05:15.903
Have you given one
minute's thought to Polly?

01:05:15.904 --> 01:05:19.040
General loves Polly.
They get along great.

01:05:19.041 --> 01:05:20.975
Birds and cats do not
get along great,

01:05:20.976 --> 01:05:24.746
in case you haven't watched Sylvester
and Tweety Bird on television.

01:05:27.133 --> 01:05:32.089
General wouldn't do a think to
hurt Polly. He's nonviolent.

01:05:34.159 --> 01:05:39.146
Well, I think it's really early to decide
that, and I just wish you'd understand.

01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:43.853
Also, your mom just happened to have a
conference call with Nana last evening.

01:05:43.854 --> 01:05:49.326
And Nana told your mom
that... cats steal kids' breath.

01:05:49.327 --> 01:05:52.830
Why would General take <i>my</i>
breath if he has his own?

01:05:53.231 --> 01:05:56.733
You have to put all the
animals outside in the night,

01:05:56.734 --> 01:06:00.105
I mean, especially the cat
animals. Because if you don't...

01:06:00.106 --> 01:06:06.433
they climb up and sit on your chest and
suck all your breath out like this.

01:06:08.534 --> 01:06:13.106
- That is very, very helpful, Hugh.
- Thank you very, very much.

01:06:13.807 --> 01:06:15.541
Come on. Sit down and
have your breakfast.

01:06:15.542 --> 01:06:18.245
No! No. Jokes about my
mother's accent in the morning

01:06:18.246 --> 01:06:21.082
just have this way of
killing my appetite.

01:06:32.261 --> 01:06:34.229
Nonviolent, my ass.

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:36.099
Mom.

01:06:39.403 --> 01:06:42.006
I'm sorry we laughed at Nana.

01:06:42.007 --> 01:06:45.409
- But couldn't you...
- No. The subject is closed.

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:47.780
Bus in fifteen minutes.

01:07:26.059 --> 01:07:30.630
- Mama, can't General just stay with me...
- No. No.

01:07:30.631 --> 01:07:34.836
Don't forget those back teeth. That's
where most of the food gets stuck.

01:07:36.237 --> 01:07:38.039
Get the back.

01:07:44.048 --> 01:07:45.615
Hi, doll.

01:07:45.816 --> 01:07:47.316
Hi, daddy.

01:07:48.517 --> 01:07:52.458
You know, Amanda, it would be a lot easier
for me to get General back in the house

01:07:52.459 --> 01:07:55.193
if I knew what these bad
dreams were all about.

01:07:55.394 --> 01:07:56.893
Why?

01:07:58.865 --> 01:08:02.434
Why? Because when <i>you</i> play
the violin, little girl,

01:08:02.435 --> 01:08:06.642
everybody listens, including
your mom. So, come on. Tell me.

01:08:07.043 --> 01:08:10.344
Well, I can only remember
that there's a monster in it.

01:08:10.345 --> 01:08:13.014
A monster? What's he like?

01:08:13.015 --> 01:08:16.051
Do you know that story
about the goats?

01:08:16.053 --> 01:08:19.256
<i>- The Three Billy Goats Gruff?</i>
- That's the one.

01:08:19.256 --> 01:08:22.326
Well, this one lives in
my wall right there.

01:08:29.401 --> 01:08:32.205
But General kept those
dreams away last night.

01:08:32.206 --> 01:08:35.741
Can't he come in for
good, daddy, please?

01:08:35.742 --> 01:08:39.679
You know, Amanda, your mom
is really serious about this.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.216
Yeah, I know. Just like
getting your back teeth.

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:47.023
That's where all the food gets stuck,
and cats stealing kids' breath.

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:51.995
Well, my making fun of nanny's accent
at the breakfast table this morning

01:08:51.996 --> 01:08:53.996
probably didn't get us
off to the best of starts.

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:59.537
But I might be able to bring your mother
around. No promises, but maybe.

01:08:59.537 --> 01:09:01.606
No promises.

01:09:11.334 --> 01:09:15.240
You know, Amanda...
there are no real monsters.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.576
Yeah. I guess I do.

01:09:18.577 --> 01:09:21.046
OK. Go to sleep now.

01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:26.587
- No bad dreams.
- No bad dreams.

01:09:44.676 --> 01:09:49.747
You know, I think she was beginning to cry
when I kissed her good night tonight.

01:09:50.548 --> 01:09:52.584
Come on, Hugh.

01:10:03.631 --> 01:10:07.136
What do you say we talk about
it just a little bit more, huh?

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:10.672
Hugh, I just don't trust that cat.

01:14:13.864 --> 01:14:16.134
- What was that?
- What was that?

01:14:16.135 --> 01:14:18.570
I don't know. I'll go.

01:14:24.328 --> 01:14:26.964
General, is that you?

01:14:27.165 --> 01:14:28.831
Meow!

01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:31.702
Meow.

01:14:35.508 --> 01:14:37.442
Polly!

01:14:38.894 --> 01:14:40.394
Mandy?

01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:44.034
Polly's dead.

01:14:44.335 --> 01:14:49.173
- The monster in my wall killed Polly.
- Oh, no.

01:14:49.874 --> 01:14:53.061
I knew it. I knew it!

01:14:53.062 --> 01:14:54.996
It's OK.

01:14:58.534 --> 01:15:01.538
I told you this would happen.

01:15:02.757 --> 01:15:04.791
Look at this!

01:15:06.929 --> 01:15:09.098
It's OK. It's OK.

01:15:25.116 --> 01:15:28.737
- She's convinced the cat didn't do it.
- Yes, I know.

01:15:28.738 --> 01:15:32.142
She's convinced that it was a troll
that got tired of living under a bridge

01:15:32.143 --> 01:15:35.478
and is now living in her wall.
But she is 8, and you're 38.

01:15:35.479 --> 01:15:40.050
And that cat's tracks were on
her windowsill in Polly's blood.

01:15:40.051 --> 01:15:44.088
Now, are you gonna take care
of Polly, or do you want me to?

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:53.015
Well, here he goes, killer.

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:58.056
You know, I would have thought that you'd
have cleared out of here by now, too.

01:15:58.057 --> 01:16:01.460
You know, your welcome's getting
pretty threadbare. Hmm?

01:16:05.131 --> 01:16:06.899
Come here.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.635
What have we got here?

01:16:11.639 --> 01:16:15.109
Who did that to you? Hmm?

01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:18.247
Hey, the cat's got a
wound on his shoulder.

01:16:18.248 --> 01:16:21.063
- So what?
- I don't know...

01:16:21.689 --> 01:16:23.152
Seems like a big wound.

01:16:23.153 --> 01:16:28.110
Yeah, well, Polly got in one good peck
before that cat killed him. Good for Polly.

01:16:28.111 --> 01:16:33.748
Uh-huh. I certainly never realized
that Polly had such a... big pecker.

01:16:35.918 --> 01:16:39.322
You know, you better get ready
for work. You're gonna be late.

01:17:26.644 --> 01:17:28.679
You stay right there.

01:17:30.551 --> 01:17:35.587
Come on. Looky look. Good food.

01:17:35.588 --> 01:17:37.423
Come on.

01:17:39.427 --> 01:17:42.797
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Mama's got your favorite food.

01:17:42.798 --> 01:17:47.387
Come on, you furry little
bastard. Come on. Come on.

01:17:50.825 --> 01:17:52.759
OK.

01:17:55.396 --> 01:17:57.331
Going.

01:17:59.068 --> 01:18:01.102
Going.

01:18:08.947 --> 01:18:12.484
Your bird-killing days
are over, my friend.

01:18:47.993 --> 01:18:50.629
General!

01:18:53.318 --> 01:18:56.152
General!

01:18:58.390 --> 01:19:01.893
General!

01:19:06.933 --> 01:19:09.402
General!

01:19:53.654 --> 01:19:56.391
Tomorrow's your big day, fella.

01:20:08.809 --> 01:20:12.794
Do you think General ran away because
you thought he killed Polly?

01:20:12.795 --> 01:20:14.563
Honey, cats don't think.

01:20:14.564 --> 01:20:19.602
General does, and he knows that you
think that cats steal kids' breath.

01:21:42.519 --> 01:21:44.619
Blech!

01:22:19.181 --> 01:22:20.715
Hey!

01:25:11.971 --> 01:25:13.253
What was that?

01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:17.676
Mommy!

01:25:30.343 --> 01:25:32.978
- Mommy!
- Amanda!

01:25:33.479 --> 01:25:36.316
- Get out of my way!
- Amanda!

01:25:37.414 --> 01:25:39.768
- Amanda!
- Amanda!

01:25:47.213 --> 01:25:50.483
Amanda! Amanda!

01:26:05.985 --> 01:26:09.038
Get him, General! Get him!

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:16.630
Oh, no!

01:26:26.192 --> 01:26:29.246
Come on! Don't let him get away!

01:26:32.183 --> 01:26:34.903
Please! Amanda!

01:26:34.904 --> 01:26:37.889
Mommy and daddy. We're not angry.

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:41.795
Hugh! What is wrong?
Why won't this door open?

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:44.280
Come on, General! Get him!

01:26:48.754 --> 01:26:52.423
Uh-oh. No!

01:26:57.430 --> 01:27:01.150
Come on, General! You can do it!

01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:07.139
Cream him! Cream him!

01:27:20.092 --> 01:27:23.928
Watch out, General! Watch out!

01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:25.931
Come on, General!

01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:27.248
Amanda!

01:27:27.249 --> 01:27:30.152
General is fighting the monster!

01:27:31.021 --> 01:27:32.921
Amanda!

01:27:43.652 --> 01:27:45.854
Play it faster!

01:27:51.411 --> 01:27:54.782
- Play it faster!
<i>- Every breath you take</i>

01:27:54.783 --> 01:27:56.751
<i>Every move you make</i>

01:27:56.752 --> 01:27:58.802
<i>Every bond you break
Every step you take</i>

01:27:58.803 --> 01:28:00.403
<i>I'll be watching you...</i>

01:28:08.833 --> 01:28:09.934
General!

01:28:09.935 --> 01:28:12.302
Amanda!

01:28:18.244 --> 01:28:20.029
Where did he come from?

01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:22.099
Where did he come from?

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.852
Give me that cat!

01:28:23.877 --> 01:28:26.887
- Give me that cat!
- Quiet!

01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:32.390
It wasn't General that was trying to
take my breath! It was the monster...

01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:37.049
and General fixed him!
You've gotta believe me!

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:39.335
Amanda, where did it go?

01:28:39.736 --> 01:28:44.674
General played him on the
record player and swoosh! Zoom!

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:47.753
Into the fan and got smushed.

01:28:54.553 --> 01:28:57.724
- Oh, my God.
- Yuck.

01:28:57.725 --> 01:29:01.528
Hugh, what do you think it is?

01:29:16.346 --> 01:29:17.815
That's where he came from.

01:29:17.816 --> 01:29:22.187
Right there! Right there in
my wall, just like I told you!

01:29:29.145 --> 01:29:32.616
Amanda, whatever it was that was
in the wall, was... was it alone?

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.752
I mean, did it have any friends?

01:29:34.753 --> 01:29:37.121
I only saw one.

01:29:37.422 --> 01:29:40.324
Hugh, we're not gonna
tell anybody about this.

01:29:40.325 --> 01:29:41.726
Are you kidding?

01:29:41.727 --> 01:29:43.711
Amanda, promise me...

01:29:43.737 --> 01:29:47.798
promise me that you won't tell any
of your friends about this, OK?

01:29:47.824 --> 01:29:52.606
- Well, that depends.
- Depends? Depends on what?

01:29:52.607 --> 01:29:57.145
On whether or not I can keep General
and sleep with me at night.

01:29:57.146 --> 01:30:00.982
Amanda! That's blackmail.

01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:48.311
Hi.

01:32:28.545 --> 01:32:32.183
<i>I didn't know I was
under your spell</i>

01:32:32.184 --> 01:32:36.020
<i>I couldn't know
There was no way to tell</i>

01:32:36.021 --> 01:32:37.389
<i>I took the step</i>

01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:41.927
<i>I slipped up and I
didn't know why</i>

01:32:43.896 --> 01:32:47.467
<i>Deep in the dark,
it was too hard to see</i>

01:32:47.468 --> 01:32:51.539
<i>That in the night,
it had come over me</i>

01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:52.773
<i>You stole my soul</i>

01:32:52.774 --> 01:32:57.211
<i>Imprisoned me with your cat's eye</i>

01:32:58.714 --> 01:33:02.685
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you caught me unaware</i>

01:33:02.686 --> 01:33:06.523
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you hold me in your stare</i>

01:33:06.524 --> 01:33:10.161
<i>- Cat's eye
- Going to hide, but tell me where?</i>

01:33:10.162 --> 01:33:14.133
<i>- Cat's eye
- You've got me spellbound!</i>

01:33:14.134 --> 01:33:17.970
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you stole my breath away</i>

01:33:17.971 --> 01:33:21.608
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you kept me night and day</i>

01:33:21.609 --> 01:33:25.446
<i>- Cat's eye
- I can never get away</i>

01:33:25.447 --> 01:33:29.451
<i>- Cat's eye
- I am spellbound!</i>

01:33:29.452 --> 01:33:33.522
<i>It's like a dream,
only when do I wake?</i>

01:33:33.523 --> 01:33:37.292
<i>Can't even scream
Every breath that I take</i>

01:33:37.293 --> 01:33:39.829
<i>Belongs to you
What can I do?</i>

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:42.800
<i>Why should I try?</i>

01:33:44.837 --> 01:33:48.673
<i>I walk around like
a boy in a trance</i>

01:33:48.674 --> 01:33:52.512
<i>You pull the strings
I'm a puppet, I dance</i>

01:33:52.513 --> 01:33:54.913
<i> You're holding me eternally</i>

01:33:54.914 --> 01:33:58.184
<i>In your cat's eye</i>

01:33:59.788 --> 01:34:03.659
<i>- Cat's eye
- Took my heart with just a look</i>

01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:07.529
<i>- Cat's eye
- Every stare is like a hook</i>

01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:11.033
<i>- Cat's eye
- Just one look is all it took</i>

01:34:11.034 --> 01:34:15.106
<i>- Cat's eye
- You made me spellbound!</i>

01:34:15.107 --> 01:34:18.843
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you stole my breath away</i>

01:34:18.844 --> 01:34:22.581
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you kept me night and day</i>

01:34:22.582 --> 01:34:26.353
<i>- Cat's eye
- I can never get away</i>

01:34:26.354 --> 01:34:30.223
<i>- Cat's eye
- I am spellbound!</i>
