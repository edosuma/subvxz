00:55.597 --> 00:57.932
All I see are bedrooms
and nurses stations here.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.019
Yeah, well, it's a hospital.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.730
It's a children's hospital!
It needs color.

01:04.857 --> 01:05.857
Come on.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.443
Are we partners?

01:08.569 --> 01:09.152
Yeah.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.027
Are we par...
We are partners.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.279
I understand,
and I get the whole thing.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.949
Your job is to cure these kids,
my job's to make them feel better.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.368
We need animal stickers
on the windows.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.953
We need sailboats
hanging from the ceiling.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.496
We need fun things...
He's right.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.039
For once.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.791
Don't encourage him.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.961
Thank you. Thank you.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.645
I'm gonna make you
my first board member.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.047
No thank you.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.841
(chuckles)
I don't wanna sit on a board.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.135
But thank you.
Fine.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.511
Coward.
(chuckles)

01:35.637 --> 01:36.721
Bobby?
Hmm?

01:36.847 --> 01:38.848
You are the newest member
of the hospital board.

01:38.974 --> 01:39.849
Congratulations.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.142
Congratulations.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.394
Congratulations.
Mmm-hmm.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.449
You know, you're starting
a new life.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.243
You don't wanna take too
much from the old one.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.412
Says the guy with
no baggage whatsoever.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.041
Yeah, I guess I've kept it
pretty streamlined.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.376
Haven't I?

02:12.090 --> 02:13.341
I'm gonna miss you, kid.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.099
You need me,
you call me, okay?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.601
Okay.
You got it.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.026
Hey, get your own daughter.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.028
I don't need a daughter.
I have a poodle.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.112
(Laughs)

02:39.117 --> 02:40.785
Well...
Hey, hey, hey.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.703
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.249
I'm starving.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.836
(Chattering indistinctly)

03:27.040 --> 03:29.166
(Lighter flicking)

03:29.167 --> 03:31.168
Hey, hey, not in the car.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.420
I'm serious.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.053
Maybe I should just
move in.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.513
(Chuckling)

03:42.639 --> 03:45.558
You are not moving in.
Best years of our lives, right...

03:45.684 --> 03:47.727
It's like... It's like
college all over again.

03:47.853 --> 03:52.189
But no poodles,
no responsibility...

03:52.190 --> 03:55.026
Since when was she
your responsibility?

03:55.152 --> 03:56.861
You guys would be lost
without me. You know it.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.196
Oh, really? I don't know.
Yes, let's be honest.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.406
Maybe not.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.951
I'm just happy. I'm just happy
I got my friends back.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.078
Full time, Bobby.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.204
(Chuckling) Hey... Hey.

04:07.956 --> 04:08.998
Whoa!
(Shrieking)

05:06.264 --> 05:08.766
(Heart monitor beeping)

06:17.335 --> 06:19.170
(Clock ticking)

06:28.346 --> 06:34.310
(Phone ringing)

06:43.361 --> 06:45.029
(Ringing continues)

06:56.458 --> 06:59.460
Yes.
Woman: Hi, Franny?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.420
Is that you?
Is this Franny?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.422
I'm sorry, who...
Who is this?

07:03.548 --> 07:06.008
It's me, Olivia.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.136
Hello?
Uh...

07:09.262 --> 07:10.513
What's this about?

07:10.639 --> 07:12.515
It's Poodles.
Is it...

07:12.641 --> 07:14.391
Poodles, come on.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.309
A poodle?

07:15.393 --> 07:16.477
Franny...

07:16.603 --> 07:17.686
(Scoffs) No, I'm sorry,
you have the wrong number.

07:17.813 --> 07:18.938
No, I don't know
anything about...

07:19.064 --> 07:20.314
Will you stop.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.109
(Laughs) You fall
for that every time. Don't you?

07:23.235 --> 07:24.318
Poodles!
(laughs)

07:24.402 --> 07:27.279
Poo... I can't believe
this. It's really you.

07:27.405 --> 07:27.738
Yes.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.406
Holy shit!
Did I wake you?

07:29.407 --> 07:30.491
No, wake me?
No, of course not.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.409
I'm awake.
I was doing some work.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.078
Yeah... So...
So...

07:34.871 --> 07:37.164
(exhales)
So, what's going on?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.624
I just got married.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.961
You what?
And I want to move back to Philly.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.170
You wanna come home.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.736
Olivia: (chuckling)
I know, exactly.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.281
No, he didn't...
He didn't want me to ask you.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.118
He's... He's really sweet,
you're gonna love him.

08:14.744 --> 08:15.786
No, it wasn't a big deal.

08:15.912 --> 08:19.123
It was just a stupid argument
with this department chair.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.627
Wow, Franny, that's...
That's amazing.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.131
Okay.

08:28.216 --> 08:28.966
Talk to you soon. Bye.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.892
You didn't have
to tell him all that, did you?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.178
Oh, it's just Franny.
He doesn't care.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.554
Wait, when was
the last time you even saw this guy?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.222
This guy?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.433
Well, I haven't
even met him, have I?

08:40.145 --> 08:41.270
So, what did he say?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.480
Um...

08:44.149 --> 08:46.150
Well, he said, "yeah."

08:46.276 --> 08:47.818
(Chuckling)
He said, "yeah"?

08:47.944 --> 08:48.944
What does that mean?

08:49.070 --> 08:51.655
He said, "yes,
it shouldn't be a problem."

08:51.781 --> 08:53.782
What, for a job
or an interview?

08:53.909 --> 08:55.659
I think he just
got you a job.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.495
(Both chuckling)

08:58.496 --> 09:01.498
Holy shit, can he...
Can he even do that?

09:01.499 --> 09:03.500
There's very little
that man can't do.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.793
(Chuckles) Really?

09:04.920 --> 09:05.920
(Knocking)

09:06.046 --> 09:07.087
Franny?

09:17.515 --> 09:18.557
Morning, Fran.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.476
Hey.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.521
You know, I'm getting really tired
of these northern exposures, Jesse.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.882
Oh, do you want me to move
you to a suite on the other side?

09:26.983 --> 09:28.442
It's not a problem.
No, no, no, no.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.735
Why don't we just...

09:29.861 --> 09:31.570
We'll put it back
the way it was before.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.947
I'm expecting guests.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.032
Guests?

09:53.301 --> 09:57.012
She's coming. Poodles is coming.
Yeah, it's good.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.153
Whoa!

10:14.447 --> 10:16.573
(Laughing)

10:16.574 --> 10:19.118
So, does this mean...
Does this mean

10:19.244 --> 10:20.494
we're moving to Philly?

10:20.578 --> 10:21.578
Yeah, I guess so.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.330
And you're sure
you wanna do that?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.624
It was my idea,
wasn't it?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.334
I like this one.
I like the red one.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.752
I'm going with the red.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.758
I'm feeling younger.

10:35.677 --> 10:39.596
I'm feeling so young and fresh.

10:39.597 --> 10:43.100
I'm feeling delightful.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.019
Delightful.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.021
Delightful.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.274
Full of delight.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.400
(buzzer sounds)

10:57.032 --> 10:58.365
Hey, how are you doin'?

11:05.290 --> 11:06.623
Hey, hey!

11:06.750 --> 11:10.294
Susan, nice to see
you again. Looking good.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.381
Hey, darling.
You're new here, aren't you?

11:15.133 --> 11:16.133
Hey.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.555
Hey, bud.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.640
Oh, am I interrupting?

11:23.767 --> 11:26.060
Hey, champ,
what's the matter?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.436
I hate it here.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.605
Oh. Hmm.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.358
What can I do?

11:32.734 --> 11:34.193
Get me out of here.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.236
Well...

11:37.655 --> 11:39.031
If that's what you want.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.450
All righty!

11:43.078 --> 11:46.622
Yep. We're gonna
get you out of here, partner.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.706
What are you doing?

11:47.791 --> 11:49.541
Making an escape.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.711
All righty.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.426
(Grunts)

12:00.678 --> 12:02.054
What are we doing?

12:02.180 --> 12:05.391
We are hiding.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.102
Sometimes when
I'm feeling really sad,

12:08.228 --> 12:09.728
I just go and hide somewhere.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.689
You do?
Yeah, yeah, sure. All the time.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.024
Everybody does.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.360
Do you ever get found?

12:18.988 --> 12:21.407
Only when there's
someone looking.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.576
Yeah.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.454
But you know what?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.499
It's a lot better when you have
someone to hide with.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.459
You know that.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.294
You're with me.
Got it?

12:36.297 --> 12:38.549
Can I ask you
something really serious?

12:38.675 --> 12:41.718
I got an old friend coming home.
I'm throwing her a party.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.095
You think
I should get a haircut?

12:43.221 --> 12:45.597
Yeah, you look like a wizard.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.891
Yeah... Seems
to be unanimous.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.018
All right. Whatever.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.071
So, how do I look?

13:01.197 --> 13:05.242
I honestly cannot remember the
last time you looked this good.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.327
You're just saying that.
Aren't you. You're just saying that.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.495
No, no, no.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.330
You look good, Franny.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.460
She'll tell you the same.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.296
This will be the first time
I've seen him in years.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.757
Really? Is he not
usually at the hospital?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.926
He stops in and sees
the kids every once in awhile.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.678
Otherwise he's a ghost.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.846
(Laughing)

13:25.972 --> 13:27.764
Still haven't met the guy yet.

13:27.765 --> 13:28.932
Not for long,
though. Right?

13:29.058 --> 13:31.268
From what I understand,
you're Franny's star recruit.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.813
Hired on the spot.
I'm just happy to be here.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.650
I guess it's safe to say that things
were expedited a bit more than usual

13:38.776 --> 13:40.277
for this young man.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.447
Now, we gotta find
something for him to do. Right?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.365
Right.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.622
(Exhales)

14:09.807 --> 14:11.433
(Classical music playing)

14:26.533 --> 14:29.368
(Chuckling) I'm back.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.828
I didn't die.
You're right. Hey, hey, hey.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.122
Nice haircut.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.832
Yeah, you need the haircut.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.876
(Stammering) Wait...

14:38.002 --> 14:41.838
A fresh face in a sea
of old farts.

14:41.839 --> 14:45.926
You, you are Dr. Luke.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.386
Yeah. Nice to meet
you, sir.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.846
Welcome to Philadelphia, really.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.933
Jesus, you are
gorgeous. Wow.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.601
Well, she did good.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.813
Hey, are you really a doctor

14:57.897 --> 14:58.939
or do you play
one on TV? I'm kidding.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.483
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding. Ah! (chuckles)

15:01.609 --> 15:02.609
The young doctor.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.860
Yeah, I got something for you.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.779
These are cuff links.
Come here.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.032
Look... (Mutters)

15:09.158 --> 15:11.785
You're gonna be a man.
Do this.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.704
I bought these for Olivia's dad.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.997
It was many moons ago.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.083
I think it's appropriate
that you have them.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.087
You've got some
very big shoes to fill.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.880
Thank you, but I...
You don't have to tell poodles about

15:23.881 --> 15:24.881
these cuff links, do you?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.758
No, of course not.
Keep it just between us.

15:26.884 --> 15:27.884
No, of course.
Of course.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.470
Who exactly is Poodles?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.599
That's her name.
You didn't know that?

15:34.892 --> 15:36.727
Oh, Olivia, right.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.895
No, sorry, I...

15:38.896 --> 15:40.564
Now, where's Poodles?
Poodles, right.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.551
(Sighs)

16:26.069 --> 16:27.444
Why are you hiding?

16:29.113 --> 16:31.239
I haven't seen
any of these people in years.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.618
I don't feel like
being judged.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.330
You want me
to tell them to leave? I will.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.503
Look at you.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.300
Last time
I saw something so perfect

16:52.136 --> 16:53.637
you were in there.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.642
I knew...

17:00.228 --> 17:02.604
I knew you'd be
someone very special.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.315
I'm never wrong.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.983
Franny: Poodles,
we're here for you, darling.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.319
You'll never know how happy

17:09.444 --> 17:10.724
it makes me to see
you right now.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.949
You spent your whole life making
me and everyone around you smile

17:14.032 --> 17:16.576
and I'm just so happy
that you're back

17:16.703 --> 17:19.538
and you're giving us
even more reasons to smile.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.667
When Olivia's father and mother
got married...

17:24.794 --> 17:26.169
Actually, right over here.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.003
I sang a song

17:29.006 --> 17:31.508
for my best friend
and his new bride.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.720
And to keep that
tradition going

17:34.846 --> 17:37.013
I'm just gonna go out
and do it again.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.432
And no one can stop me!

17:38.558 --> 17:39.641
(Applauding)

17:44.021 --> 17:45.480
Hey, Luke.
Hey, Luke, man.

17:45.606 --> 17:49.276
You think that's your girl?
No, man, that's my girl.

17:50.236 --> 17:53.196
♪ I got sunshine

17:54.115 --> 17:58.034
♪ On a cloudy day

17:58.035 --> 17:59.536
Come on out here
and dance, you two.

17:59.662 --> 18:03.248
♪ And when
it's cold outside

18:03.374 --> 18:06.877
♪ You know I've got
the month of may

18:07.003 --> 18:10.046
♪ You know I've got
the month, the month of may

18:10.173 --> 18:11.214
♪ Yeah ♪

18:11.340 --> 18:12.758
That's good, come on, now.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.389
(Inaudible)

19:32.338 --> 19:35.131
(Franny murmuring)

19:46.018 --> 19:47.143
(Sighs)

19:55.611 --> 19:58.822
I don't remember
the last time I was out here.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.388
That's why you're sitting on your
butt and not helping me out.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.909
I knew there was a reason.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.664
I know you probably
won't remember this.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.666
You know, when you
were a little girl,

20:09.792 --> 20:13.670
you used to think I was a fisherman
just because I had this boat.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.089
I'm pretty sure you told
me you were a fisherman.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.757
Yeah, well, probably.

20:19.677 --> 20:20.677
But...

20:21.637 --> 20:23.471
You know,
I had to be something.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.769
I always liked being a fisherman,
that's for sure.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.199
Franny, I want to apologize.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.118
What are you talking about?

20:46.329 --> 20:47.871
For leaving when I did.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.833
I should have been
there for your recovery.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.962
Stop it, Poodles.
No, I'm serious.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.214
I just had to
get out of here.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.133
But I'm sorry.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.305
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.226
It's not like I went
out of the way to do anything, either.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.519
So...

21:12.229 --> 21:13.396
(Franny sighs)

21:13.522 --> 21:16.149
I dunno about you
but... Can't do anything about it.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.233
Think about right now.

21:17.234 --> 21:20.236
Here you are.
It's great. Look at you.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.738
I know what you're thinking.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.620
I'm not too young
to have a family of my own again.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.000
No. No, you're not.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.287
(Whistles) Yo.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.664
Hey.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.332
This is a nice surprise.
Uh-huh.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.625
A real nice surprise...

22:15.751 --> 22:18.628
Apparently, Franny has
a wedding gift for us.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.312
Keep your eyes closed.
Come on.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.245
(Chuckles)

22:52.329 --> 22:54.581
Why are we here?
(Chuckles)

22:54.707 --> 22:57.834
You are not gonna
have a baby in north Philly.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.440
What are you talking about?
No, uh-uh.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.503
Why can't we have
a baby in north...

23:00.629 --> 23:02.005
Look. Look at this.
Look at this. Look at this.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.931
Don't you want a baby
that grows up in nature,

23:03.966 --> 23:06.259
grows up with everything
that Poodles had.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.095
Holy shit.
Is this your old house?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.346
Not anymore, it isn't.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.808
Did you buy my house?

23:13.934 --> 23:16.102
(chuckles)
I bought it for the three of you.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.354
Welcome home!

23:18.355 --> 23:20.523
Jesus Christ, Franny. Can we
just slow down for a second shh.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.901
Wait, wait, wait, wait wait.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.654
How do you know
she even wants this?

23:26.781 --> 23:29.074
Come on. Give it a minute.
Look around, man.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.998
Still has magic, doesn't it?

23:38.375 --> 23:39.417
Yeah.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.920
Yeah, don't you feel it.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.882
Hey, enjoy it.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.347
Franny...
This is beautiful.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.932
(Stammering) It really is.
It's a beautiful house.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.351
But um...
We can't just up and leave.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.769
I signed a lease, so...

23:57.895 --> 24:00.396
Oh, no, it's all right.
I talked to your landlord. He's fine with it.

24:00.481 --> 24:01.689
You talked to my landlord?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.399
I wanted to take a little weight off...
Why didn't you...

24:03.484 --> 24:04.567
Come here, come here.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.944
You talked to...
No, of course I talked to him.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.737
No, I just...
I'm just trying to help you out.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.406
I know that you probably are
buried underneath loans

24:10.407 --> 24:12.408
and crazy stuff...
You got student loans, right?

24:12.409 --> 24:13.409
Yeah, sure...
How much?

24:13.536 --> 24:15.411
How... How much?
How much?

24:15.412 --> 24:16.704
I don't know.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.040
A couple hundred grand.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.418
I'm kidding.
Relax, man.

24:22.503 --> 24:23.878
I mean, you really think
I'm that tacky?

24:24.004 --> 24:26.464
She's standing right there.
That's really fucked, Lukie.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.299
You are...
(Laughs)

24:31.137 --> 24:33.513
I love surprises.
Look at her.

24:33.639 --> 24:34.430
Just look at her.

24:34.515 --> 24:38.101
I don't wanna step on your toes, all right?
Believe me about that.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.770
So, you know.
All I want is really what's best for you

24:40.896 --> 24:43.773
and her and for your family.
I know.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.441
You know,
it's okay, it's okay.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.642
Look, you wanna
know the truth?

24:46.694 --> 24:47.734
All you gotta do
is say no.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.445
You say no
and that is it.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.239
Because you're the man, Lukie.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.115
You are the man.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.081
Why do you have to make
everything so dramatic?

24:54.201 --> 24:55.785
(Laughs)
I'm dramatic?

24:55.911 --> 24:57.370
You think I'm dramatic?

24:57.454 --> 24:59.122
I can't believe you did this.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.791
You know, I was the one
that found this house

25:01.917 --> 25:03.459
when your mother
was pregnant with you.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.378
No, you didn't.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.880
I found the realtor,
all right?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.465
Hey, hey, hey, Franny.
Can we just talk about this for a minute?

25:09.466 --> 25:10.466
Yeah, let's go inside and talk.

25:10.593 --> 25:14.053
Just, just stop.
Just me and Livvy, yeah?

25:14.180 --> 25:14.971
Oh, really?
Yeah.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.056
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Didn't quite get that.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.392
Yeah, that's fine. Sure.
I'll put the pens away.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.477
No one has
to sign anything...

25:21.478 --> 25:23.229
I'll tell you what.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.482
You can go in.
Spend some time for yourself.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.818
"P" for "Poodles."

25:30.112 --> 25:31.279
Enjoy.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.741
Don't break anything.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.214
Holy shit.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.844
(Laughs)
Is this guy for real?

25:57.348 --> 25:58.348
You all right?

25:59.058 --> 26:00.058
Did you see him?

26:01.518 --> 26:03.519
I don't think
we can say no.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.720
(Grunts)

26:39.556 --> 26:40.932
So, why's he so rich?

26:42.059 --> 26:43.059
Never asked.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.478
You never asked?

26:45.562 --> 26:46.562
I find that kind of
hard to believe.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.815
No, I was just a kid.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.621
I didn't think
about those kinds of things.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.487
Has he ever had a job?

26:54.571 --> 26:55.905
Yeah.
Like what?

26:57.074 --> 26:58.658
I don't know.
He's a philanthropist.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.828
(Chuckles)
That's definitely not a job.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.748
He's been through a lot.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.126
So, he's 60.

27:08.252 --> 27:12.297
Got no kids, no family,
and no job.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.467
I don't know what
the fuck he does all day.

27:19.013 --> 27:21.723
I guess
I really have no idea.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.641
You told me
he was put together.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.562
That dude is not
put together.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.939
You're being an asshole.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.109
Come on. I just wanna know
what he wants from us.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.200
I owe it to him.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.163
You owe it to him
to take a house from him?

27:50.127 --> 27:52.211
I want our baby
to know my family.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.175
That house is
the closest I can get to them.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.263
(Sighs)

28:02.389 --> 28:03.639
Yeah, I know.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.186
Come on, now.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.438
Let's put it all in the front here first.
Are you okay with that?

28:10.564 --> 28:13.024
Yeah. We'll put it in the front
and figure it out later.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.610
Okay...

28:15.694 --> 28:18.571
Come on, guys. Maybe...
Big stuff. You want me to hold

28:18.655 --> 28:19.989
this for you? I'll hold it.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.325
Bring it in.
Bring that in.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.328
Bring that in.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.664
We're doing something very special here,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:28.665 --> 28:32.085
We're turning
a house into a home.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.045
You look good
carrying stuff, man.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.464
You look really good carrying.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.716
(Chuckles)

28:38.842 --> 28:40.134
Oh, look at her over there.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.429
Wish I was pregnant.
I could just sit there

28:43.555 --> 28:45.098
and pull on a doobie.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.166
Oh, no.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.710
(Chuckles)

29:56.587 --> 29:57.753
All right,
what did she do?

29:57.754 --> 29:59.422
It's actually perfect for you.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.425
No!

30:02.551 --> 30:05.261
Just like the good 'ol days...
Let us sleep!

30:05.387 --> 30:07.930
Good ol' days.
(Laughing) Let us sleep.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.090
And you, a doctor...
Shameful, shameful...

31:24.216 --> 31:25.716
Jesus Christ, Franny.
What are you doing here?

31:25.842 --> 31:27.301
You know, this is moving day.
Where've ya been?

31:27.427 --> 31:30.346
I've been at the job
you got me, working. Ah.

31:30.472 --> 31:32.223
Come on, I need you to
help me out with something.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.267
No, no, no.
I need to go see Livvy.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.686
Poodles is sleeping.
Put that out...

31:36.812 --> 31:37.853
Here.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.689
No vices. Come on.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.831
What am I doing here, Franny?

32:00.711 --> 32:02.878
Wait a minute, wait.
Stop, stop, stop...

32:02.879 --> 32:06.048
(Laughing)
A-ha!

32:07.050 --> 32:10.219
I knew it! I knew it, damn!

32:11.722 --> 32:13.055
What is it?

32:15.017 --> 32:17.935
(Laughing)
Oh, a-ha...

32:18.061 --> 32:19.895
How are you, friend?
How've ya been?

32:20.022 --> 32:21.230
You been good? Yeah...

32:21.356 --> 32:24.567
(Laughing)
I can't believe this.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.861
Mia and I...

32:26.945 --> 32:29.196
We brought this up here...

32:29.323 --> 32:31.574
Right after they moved in.

32:32.743 --> 32:33.909
Mia?
Yeah.

32:34.036 --> 32:37.204
Like, Olivia's mom?
Yeah, yeah.

32:37.331 --> 32:39.915
What were they like?
Olivia doesn't really...

32:40.042 --> 32:41.834
Olivia doesn't really
talk about them much.

32:41.918 --> 32:42.960
We were...

32:43.086 --> 32:44.920
We were partners in crime.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.922
Bobby was my sidekick.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.885
Mia...

32:55.932 --> 32:58.476
She was something else,
she was...

32:58.602 --> 33:00.686
She was the fun one.
Of the three of us,

33:00.812 --> 33:02.563
that was her.
You know...

33:02.689 --> 33:05.483
We brought the best bottle up
and we buried it here.

33:05.609 --> 33:08.736
You know, I don't know exactly
what we were...

33:08.862 --> 33:12.031
Thinking. I guess the idea was
when we were old and thirsty,

33:12.157 --> 33:14.325
we'd come up and get it.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.954
Now it's just you and me,
partner.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.956
(Laughing)
Bottom's up!

33:21.958 --> 33:23.209
Yeah.

33:24.836 --> 33:25.836
Mmm.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.384
Hey, Franny, I need
to ask you something.

33:31.510 --> 33:35.346
Ah... Trying to have a moment
here, kid. Don't fuck it up.

33:39.309 --> 33:41.310
Did you pay my loan?

33:43.105 --> 33:45.189
Listen, if you don't
know about it,

33:45.315 --> 33:47.400
I don't know about it.

33:48.318 --> 33:50.736
So, you did, you paid my loans?
I did.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.571
You...

33:52.698 --> 33:54.156
Jesus Christ, Franny.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.575
How?
How... Lukie,

33:56.702 --> 33:59.704
Lukie, you work for me now.
I know your finances.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.330
Consider this a signing bonus.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.957
A signing bonus?
I'm not an athlete, Franny.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.667
No, you're a doctor.
You actually deserve a bonus.

34:04.793 --> 34:05.668
No, no, no, no...

34:05.794 --> 34:08.003
This isn't okay, all right?
I'm not your fucking...

34:08.130 --> 34:09.170
I'm not your fucking sidekick.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.005
Why are you being so
fucking selfish?

34:11.007 --> 34:12.967
You think it's about you
and just you?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.719
I did this for Poodles, too.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.762
Not just you, both of you.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.723
Sit down! Please...

34:18.849 --> 34:21.308
Sit down. Sit down right here.
Please, sit down.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.521
You're a doctor,
you shouldn't have loans.

34:25.647 --> 34:28.524
You should be saving people.
It's simple, all right?

34:28.650 --> 34:31.527
You could fight this all you want.
It doesn't matter. It's gonna...

34:32.862 --> 34:34.071
(Sighing)

34:34.197 --> 34:36.114
All right.
Pay me back in five years.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.949
Pay you back? (Laughing)
Every penny.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.784
Or you're in trouble, buddy.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.954
I mean that. Yeah, look...

34:42.038 --> 34:44.438
Truth is, I'm probably getting
more out of this than you are.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.219
I should be thanking you.
No, no... Stop it.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.793
Thank you.
Don't... Don't.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.880
Thank you, kid.
Come on...

34:51.922 --> 34:53.215
Thank you.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.801
Take a sip of that.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.887
Don't be rude. Sit down.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.266
It's not bad.
What is it?

35:03.059 --> 35:05.644
I don't even remember
what it was.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.938
(Laughing) Don't waste it,
Don't waste it.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.690
(Exhaling)
Whoa...

35:10.400 --> 35:12.902
Fuck me...
You're such a pussy.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.741
(Door closing)

35:31.505 --> 35:35.257
Is there something I can bring you up?
No, no. I'm fine.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.558
Is, uh... Is Charlie here?

35:45.852 --> 35:48.103
Charlie... Charlie's, uh...

35:48.104 --> 35:50.064
(Laughing)
Charlie's out back.

35:54.027 --> 35:57.238
Uh-huh...
(Laughing continues)

35:58.490 --> 35:59.657
(Giggling)

36:05.831 --> 36:08.165
You sure I can't get you something...
Hey, Lukie. Lukie...

36:08.291 --> 36:09.917
Lukie, did I...

36:10.043 --> 36:11.335
You know...

36:11.461 --> 36:13.045
I don't know if I
told you about this.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.297
There's a fundraiser
for the hospital.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.675
I'm thinking maybe you should
come with me.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.677
Um...

36:19.803 --> 36:22.137
Well, I mean, yeah...
I'd be honored, but I can't.

36:22.138 --> 36:22.721
I'm working tomorrow.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.140
Yeah, I know.
I spoke to Romano. Yeah.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.475
The board cleared it.
It's fine.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.143
You went to the
board for this?

36:28.270 --> 36:32.898
Well, yeah, I mean... I'm...
I kind of am the board.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.692
(Luke and Franny laughing)

36:34.818 --> 36:37.152
Yeah.
(Laughing)

36:37.153 --> 36:39.238
I'm feeling like I wanna
show you off, man.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.241
You know? You are the man.
You're my man, our man,

36:42.367 --> 36:44.159
everybody's man, man...

36:44.160 --> 36:46.495
(Laughing)
What is this over here?

36:46.621 --> 36:49.373
Did you... I can't believe...
You're making the crib!

36:49.499 --> 36:51.667
Sweet!

36:51.793 --> 36:54.837
When are you finding
the time to do this? This is amazing.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.922
You know, I'm actually
pretty good with my hands.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.048
I'm a good woodworker.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.550
Hey, I would like to help.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.553
I would be proud! If I...
You know what, um...

37:02.679 --> 37:04.221
(Stammering)
I can do this.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.348
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
tackle this one on my own.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.641
I think... But, uh...

37:07.767 --> 37:10.686
Okay.
You know, if... You know,

37:10.812 --> 37:13.564
if I mess up,
you'll be the first to call.

37:13.690 --> 37:17.693
Okay. Yeah,
all right, well... Yeah.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.278
Okay.
Okay.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.322
All right, well,
you just settle in now. Okay.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.198
The two of you.
Okay.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.200
You two lovey lovebirds.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.620
Okay, we'll see you
at the hospital tomorrow.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.746
Bye.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.332
Lukie, do you have a tux?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.083
Uh... No. No, I don't.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.689
You don't, okay.
Well, don't worry about it. I got you covered.

37:35.795 --> 37:38.464
Okay, you sure?
You need anything?

37:38.590 --> 37:41.634
Just give me a call, okay?
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.344
(Door opening)

37:43.470 --> 37:45.429
Tootles, Poodles.

37:45.555 --> 37:47.723
(Giggling) Bye.
Love you.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.812
Bye, Franny.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.074
(Sighs)

38:06.868 --> 38:09.703
I don't think you were
afraid of anything.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.331
I'm not.
No. Well, that's good, that's good...

38:12.457 --> 38:15.584
'cause, um...
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.087
Did I tell you that
I had surgery once?

38:18.213 --> 38:19.964
You did?
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing.

38:20.090 --> 38:23.258
Nothing to be worried about.
Nothing. No, it was perfectly fine.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.344
When I came out...

38:25.470 --> 38:27.096
Bizarre.
But...

38:27.222 --> 38:28.263
(Laughing)

38:28.264 --> 38:30.265
I started farting
all the time!

38:30.266 --> 38:33.268
(laughing) I hope it doesn't
happen to you.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.145
Besides,

38:36.439 --> 38:38.065
I'll be here the whole time.

38:38.191 --> 38:38.941
For real?

38:39.067 --> 38:41.694
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Would you like that?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.028
Yeah.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.951
Man: (over pa) Paging Dr. Harris.
Mr. Watts is at reception.

38:49.077 --> 38:51.787
Armando, no, no, no, don't.
You don't have to measure that.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.623
The kid gets very
self-conscious about his dingy.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.291
So, where was I?
Oh, the point was... Yes.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.292
So we were...

38:57.419 --> 38:59.294
We were towards the
end of our relationship.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.838
We both knew
it was almost over...

39:00.964 --> 39:04.216
Again, beautiful girl.
Like, it's... It's over.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.259
The only thing
I can think about

39:05.343 --> 39:08.303
is she gonna be showing the
snaggly tooth to somebody else.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.723
She's gonna be doing
the snaggly, cuteness

39:10.849 --> 39:12.307
all over the place.
Right.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.810
And that's when
I realized that

39:15.770 --> 39:18.147
I actually like being alone.

39:22.736 --> 39:23.569
Right.

39:23.695 --> 39:27.239
You know, not everyone can
have a Poodles, my friend.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.324
God bless. Yeah...

39:29.451 --> 39:31.285
Amando, bring the black one.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.328
Amando,
go get the tails for him.

39:33.329 --> 39:34.955
That's good.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.624
Oh, there we go.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.835
(Sighs) Okay...
That's the deal.

39:40.336 --> 39:43.005
A-ha, maestro.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.674
Ooh, looking good.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.093
Luke: (Exhales)
Holy shit.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.513
You, uh... You sure I'm not
gonna be over-dressed?

39:51.639 --> 39:55.350
Are you kidding me?
You're going to look adorable.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.603
Go, try it on. Armando,
give him the whole thing.

39:57.729 --> 39:58.520
Let him try it on.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.190
You want me to do it now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.025
Give him the pants.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.526
Oh, yeah!

40:11.910 --> 40:14.745
Hey, Lukie, I need you
to do me a favor.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.545
Not that kind of favor,
you sick fuck. No.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.672
I... I need you to
write me a prescription.

40:25.799 --> 40:28.383
I hate to go to the doctor's office.
Those smells make me gag.

40:28.384 --> 40:32.304
Will you do that for me?
Just for convenience sake. Please.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.389
Er... Well, it's not really
something I could do, Franny.

40:34.390 --> 40:37.226
I mean, I'm on a
pretty tight leash.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.811
Ooh...

40:39.813 --> 40:42.314
I'm kind of holding
that leash.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.983
Aren't I? Yeah...
(Laughing nervously)

40:45.401 --> 40:47.986
Yeah. Um...

40:48.113 --> 40:51.406
Okay, what are you, uh...
What are you taking?

40:51.407 --> 40:54.201
Well, I don't even know
what this shit is, really.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.120
Here.

40:58.665 --> 41:01.250
Accidentally spilled it, huh?

41:01.376 --> 41:02.835
Morphine, Franny?

41:02.961 --> 41:03.961
So?

41:06.714 --> 41:09.341
Franny,
I can't prescribe you this.

41:10.426 --> 41:11.426
Why not?

41:11.553 --> 41:14.763
I can't. Are you really
in that much pain? I...

41:14.889 --> 41:17.766
I don't think you need it.
(Scoffs)

41:17.892 --> 41:21.979
I really don't think you should
be telling me what I need, Lukie.

41:23.231 --> 41:26.441
You know, it wasn't easy
getting you this job.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.742
Franny, how long
have you been taking this?

41:35.869 --> 41:37.536
I'm kidding, I'm kidding,
I'm sorry.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.455
No, I'm kidding.
This was all a joke, man.

41:40.582 --> 41:42.708
It was a test.
Relax, relax.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.377
You passed the test.
You did good. I'm proud of you.

41:45.461 --> 41:46.628
You did that?
No, no, no, this is good.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.213
You are like Bobby.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.100
Shit, man, you are exactly like this.
He wouldn't have done it either.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.718
No, you don't roll over
for anybody.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.470
Not for me. Nobody.
The world needs more men like you.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.556
Thank god I know you!

42:44.520 --> 42:46.271
Hey, remember me?

42:46.564 --> 42:48.106
Franny.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.525
Your old friend, Franny.
Franny Watts.

42:50.526 --> 42:53.362
(Laughing)
How ya been?

42:53.488 --> 42:58.033
Francis. Yeah, Franny, Francis,
whatever. Francis Watts.

42:58.159 --> 43:02.537
Here you go. Could you
fill that up for me, please? Thanks.

43:02.664 --> 43:05.415
You don't have
any more refills, sir.

43:07.794 --> 43:09.670
That can't be right.

43:09.796 --> 43:12.547
(Bottle clatters)

43:12.548 --> 43:15.384
Do you have a new
prescription, sir?

43:15.510 --> 43:17.844
No, I don't have a new prescription...
I never had any prescription.

43:17.971 --> 43:20.555
Dr. Gibbs calls these in
for me. That's how we do it.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.557
Then you should
call Dr. Gibbs.

43:22.558 --> 43:23.850
(Sighs)

43:23.977 --> 43:25.894
Look, man, it's after midnight.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.438
I can't call him now.
Could you...

43:28.564 --> 43:29.648
Hey.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.307
Are you looking for the right name
in here? Sir. Sir, yes!

43:34.404 --> 43:36.571
Sir, please, do not touch the computer.
Well, look under Gibbs...

43:36.572 --> 43:38.657
If it's urgent you should
go to the hospital.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.450
I have a hospital, all right?

43:40.576 --> 43:42.577
I own a hospital.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.913
Then you should
go there, sir.

43:45.039 --> 43:48.083
(Whispering)
Okay, okay, okay, I'm good...

43:51.713 --> 43:54.756
Look... I'm sorry.

43:54.882 --> 43:57.592
Look at this.
Look what I got. Look what I got.

43:57.593 --> 44:00.178
I'm just gonna put it here.
That's...

44:02.181 --> 44:03.056
Does that help you?

44:03.182 --> 44:04.933
Does it make it easier for you to help me?
Sorry, sir.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.560
Just get out of here. Okay?
I can't help you, sir.

44:06.644 --> 44:07.644
Does it help?

44:07.729 --> 44:11.273
Help me. Could you help me?
Help me.

44:11.399 --> 44:12.482
Could you help me out?

44:12.608 --> 44:14.609
There's nothing I can do to help you, sir.
Could you help me out?

44:14.736 --> 44:15.861
I'm not feeling good...

44:15.987 --> 44:17.946
You should call your doctor.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.032
He can get you
a new prescription.

44:21.617 --> 44:24.536
There's nothing else
I can do for you, sir.

44:27.332 --> 44:30.000
Yeah, I... Whoa.

44:30.126 --> 44:31.126
(Laughs)

44:32.420 --> 44:36.590
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
I'm a little embarrassed. I didn't, uh...

44:36.674 --> 44:39.926
Sorry, I'm really embarrassed.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be yelling at you...

44:40.053 --> 44:42.971
Sir, your watch.
Keep the watch. Keep it.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.640
(Laughing)
I want you to have it.

45:21.677 --> 45:22.844
Damn it!

45:25.681 --> 45:26.681
He's a good guy.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.100
Huh?

45:28.226 --> 45:32.687
And I was just thinking...
And...

45:32.814 --> 45:35.899
Why do I just wanna strangle him?
What?

45:36.025 --> 45:39.152
Don't get me wrong,
I like him. I do, but...

45:40.696 --> 45:43.365
I mean, how'd your dad
deal with it?

45:45.159 --> 45:47.953
My parents were
just friends with him.

45:49.330 --> 45:51.957
They didn't need
anything from him.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.460
I don't need anything
from him.

46:12.728 --> 46:15.564
Except, maybe some furniture.
(Laughs)

46:17.775 --> 46:19.109
(Shivering)

46:22.738 --> 46:24.614
God!

46:40.756 --> 46:42.090
(Crying)

46:58.983 --> 47:01.067
(Tires screeching)

47:08.618 --> 47:10.827
(Grunting)

47:14.916 --> 47:16.917
Are you okay? I'm sorry!

47:23.799 --> 47:25.217
(Straining)

47:29.889 --> 47:31.598
(Yelling)
Help!

47:32.099 --> 47:33.141
Help!

47:42.818 --> 47:45.070
Bobby! I'm coming.

47:47.657 --> 47:48.949
(Groaning)

47:58.376 --> 48:00.669
You're okay.
You'll be okay.

48:01.504 --> 48:03.421
Bobby? Bobby!

48:04.006 --> 48:06.341
Stay with me, stay with me!

48:07.468 --> 48:08.760
(Groaning)

48:11.180 --> 48:12.222
Help!

48:14.725 --> 48:17.477
Mia... Hey! Help!

48:17.853 --> 48:19.854
Help!

48:21.023 --> 48:22.941
Stay with me! Stay with me,
Don't leave...

48:23.067 --> 48:24.943
Stay with me, stay with me...

48:25.069 --> 48:27.529
Bobby! Stay with me!

48:27.655 --> 48:29.364
(Yelling)
Help!

48:30.449 --> 48:32.617
Help!

48:32.743 --> 48:34.035
(Crowd applauding)

48:34.161 --> 48:38.540
I'm not gonna shut up yet 'cause there's
one more thing I would like to do.

48:38.666 --> 48:39.874
I would like to
introduce you all

48:39.875 --> 48:43.837
to the newest member of
our board of directors of the foundation,

48:43.921 --> 48:45.297
Dr. Luke Harris.

48:46.549 --> 48:49.593
Luke, stand up.
Stand up, come on.

48:49.719 --> 48:50.760
Uh...

48:52.388 --> 48:54.723
Dr. Luke Harris, everybody!

48:55.766 --> 48:57.309
(Chuckling)
Uh...

49:01.522 --> 49:03.082
You know,
when I look at this young man,

49:03.190 --> 49:05.150
I can't help but see...

49:07.194 --> 49:09.738
See my best friend,

49:09.864 --> 49:11.865
Dr. Bobby McClellan. He, um...

49:11.949 --> 49:16.077
He's the physician who inspired this
whole enterprise. He, um...

49:16.203 --> 49:19.914
He was an honorable man.

49:19.915 --> 49:23.543
Unlike me, he didn't come up here and do a
song and dance and ask for money.

49:23.669 --> 49:24.669
He, um...

49:30.593 --> 49:31.593
(Clears throat)

49:34.680 --> 49:35.889
Sorry.

49:36.515 --> 49:38.141
My, uh...

49:39.644 --> 49:43.855
My dear friend Bobby.
The best gift he ever gave me

49:44.607 --> 49:46.399
was his friendship.

49:48.944 --> 49:51.279
And now he's giving his
legacy to me

49:51.405 --> 49:54.449
to share with this young man.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.952
You're not going to
let us down, are you?

49:57.953 --> 49:59.788
(Laughing)
Are you?

49:59.914 --> 50:02.248
No, you won't.
You won't do that.

50:05.961 --> 50:07.671
Thank you... Uh, go on.

50:07.797 --> 50:09.631
(Music playing)

50:14.553 --> 50:16.137
(Wretching)

50:49.046 --> 50:51.005
I bet you've seen worse, huh?

50:51.006 --> 50:52.632
Thank you.

50:52.758 --> 50:54.008
Thank you, thank you.

50:54.135 --> 50:55.719
(Sniffling)

51:04.562 --> 51:06.187
Hey,
it's the king of Philadelphia.

51:06.313 --> 51:09.023
Hey. Mind if I steal away
the prince for a moment?

51:09.024 --> 51:11.109
No, we can spare him...
Just for a moment, thank you very much.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.027
Let's get out of here.
You don't know who that was?

51:13.154 --> 51:15.029
He's a dickhead.

51:15.030 --> 51:16.865
If I would have ran,
he would not be Mayor.

51:16.991 --> 51:19.701
He's not mayor. Listen,
I need to get back to Olivia right away.

51:19.827 --> 51:23.496
We're only 20 minutes away,
if she goes into labor, she'll call you.

51:25.833 --> 51:27.353
Do you hear what I was
saying up there?

51:27.418 --> 51:28.042
You're the new board member.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.670
Yeah. Why am I the
new board member?

51:30.796 --> 51:31.546
'Cause that's what I want.

51:31.672 --> 51:32.922
Yeah, but it doesn't
make any sense.

51:33.048 --> 51:34.048
I haven't proven myself
to anyone.

51:34.049 --> 51:35.216
You've proven yourself to me.

51:35.342 --> 51:36.634
You don't have to prove
yourself to anyone else.

51:36.761 --> 51:38.219
You've proven yourself to
people your entire life.

51:38.345 --> 51:41.055
You've earned everything you've got.
Now just say thank you,

51:41.140 --> 51:42.599
and get drunk with me.

51:42.725 --> 51:43.433
You need this.

51:43.559 --> 51:46.352
I need this, actually.
I really need this.

51:47.188 --> 51:49.397
(Club music playing)

52:06.957 --> 52:09.083
Hey! Yo!

52:09.210 --> 52:11.085
(Yelling)
Lukie!

52:11.170 --> 52:12.587
This used to be
a cigar lounge.

52:12.713 --> 52:14.798
Bobby brought me here
on my 27th birthday.

52:14.924 --> 52:16.090
It used to be class.

52:16.091 --> 52:17.550
What are we doing here?

52:17.676 --> 52:19.093
It's my birthday.
Your birthday?

52:19.094 --> 52:22.472
Yes. Luke, Molly,
Molly, Luke.

52:22.598 --> 52:24.098
Hey, what's up?

52:24.225 --> 52:27.101
Ya want one?
I just bought 'em from Molly.

52:27.102 --> 52:30.104
I don't think her name's
Molly. That's Molly.

52:30.105 --> 52:32.315
Hey, I'm Luke, nice to...
Molly.

52:32.441 --> 52:36.110
(Laughing) Okay.
Molly gave you ecstasy, great.

52:36.111 --> 52:40.031
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Franny...
Franny, come on. Jesus Christ, man.

52:40.115 --> 52:43.034
It's my birthday, too.

52:43.118 --> 52:45.119
Yeah, hi there.
Go ahead, take it.

52:45.246 --> 52:46.287
No.
Come on, take it.

52:46.413 --> 52:47.573
Cost me 40 bucks to buy this.

52:47.623 --> 52:49.707
I don't care.
I'm not taking ecstasy.

52:49.834 --> 52:52.085
So fucking stiff! I can't believe this.
What? I'm not stiff...

52:52.169 --> 52:53.545
I mean,
I'm basically your boss

52:53.671 --> 52:55.421
and I'm telling you to take it.
You're telling me to take it.

52:55.548 --> 52:57.924
Stop it, all right.
All right, you earned this.

52:58.050 --> 52:59.133
This is for you.
Stop it.

52:59.260 --> 53:01.135
Stop it. Come off it.
Don't do that.

53:01.136 --> 53:03.471
No, I'm not taking ecstasy.
No.

53:03.806 --> 53:05.098
Whoo!

53:06.141 --> 53:08.852
Get back in there,
you hound dog.

53:08.978 --> 53:11.646
Whoo!
Ooh! How you doing?

53:12.231 --> 53:15.108
(Incoherent yelling)

53:24.076 --> 53:27.036
(On answering machine)
Hey, this is Luke. Leave a message, thanks.

53:27.162 --> 53:29.080
Hi, it's me, um...

53:29.164 --> 53:31.624
I'm not trying to
ruin your night,

53:31.750 --> 53:34.836
but I just don't know if
you're coming home.

53:34.962 --> 53:37.255
I just really don't want
to be here alone.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.466
I really don't
want to be here.

53:40.593 --> 53:41.873
So call me if
you're coming home.

53:57.318 --> 53:59.402
I gotta be honest, man.

54:00.195 --> 54:02.447
Olivia fucking loves you, man.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.534
She does.

54:07.536 --> 54:10.204
You know,
I didn't really get it at first.

54:10.331 --> 54:12.832
'Cause, you know,
you're kind of annoying,

54:12.958 --> 54:15.418
just to be honest. You see,
you have this, like,

54:15.544 --> 54:19.130
crazy uncle thing where you're
kind of cool and, like...

54:19.214 --> 54:22.800
You've got all this money and
you can just breeze in and breeze out,

54:22.927 --> 54:24.594
and you don't have to deal
with any of the problems.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.221
You know, I could see that
that's the good way to go.

54:27.348 --> 54:28.348
That's cool...

54:28.432 --> 54:29.641
You know, I'm gonna be a...

54:30.225 --> 54:31.559
I'm gonna be a dad, man.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.102
I know,
you're gonna be a dad.

54:34.021 --> 54:36.147
I'm gonna be a dad!
You're gonna be a dad!

54:36.231 --> 54:38.232
(Sobbing)
You are gonna be a dad.

54:38.233 --> 54:40.234
I'm gonna be a dad...

54:40.235 --> 54:44.238
That's crazy. No, you're gonna be...
You'd be such a good dad.

54:44.239 --> 54:46.991
You would.
You'd be such a good dad.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.494
(Laughing)
and it's like...

54:49.620 --> 54:51.704
We didn't plan it,
it just happened. And we're...

54:51.830 --> 54:54.290
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, I just have to deal with it, you know?

54:54.416 --> 54:56.250
I didn't wanna lose her.

54:56.377 --> 54:58.252
'Cause I love her.

54:58.253 --> 55:01.089
I didn't want to lose her,
but I just...

55:04.885 --> 55:08.054
I didn't think I'd be
doing it now, you know?

55:10.891 --> 55:12.266
I like this scarf.

55:12.351 --> 55:14.185
Don't be nervous.

55:14.979 --> 55:16.688
You're gonna do good.

55:16.814 --> 55:18.272
I am nervous.

55:18.399 --> 55:20.108
You're gonna be good.

55:20.234 --> 55:21.442
Good dad.

55:22.778 --> 55:23.611
Good husband.

55:23.737 --> 55:26.322
'Cause you're good.
(Laughs)

55:30.077 --> 55:31.119
Whoo!

55:35.165 --> 55:36.624
(Franny laughing)

55:48.762 --> 55:50.221
(Laughing)

55:51.557 --> 55:54.392
Come on. Come on, get up here.
All right.

56:01.233 --> 56:02.859
(Both sighing)
Feels good, right?

56:04.903 --> 56:06.904
(Laughing)

56:09.116 --> 56:10.658
Feels good!

56:10.784 --> 56:13.327
(Yelling)
Feels good!

56:13.328 --> 56:14.912
Feel good!

56:15.039 --> 56:17.623
Ah!
Whoo!

56:25.340 --> 56:27.175
Where ya been, man?

56:30.345 --> 56:31.846
Where ya been?

57:12.137 --> 57:15.348
One more stop. This is
the best of everything.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.106
(Door opens)

57:29.738 --> 57:31.489
(Laughing)
Whoa!

57:36.411 --> 57:39.372
How many of us are there here?
(Chuckling)

57:39.456 --> 57:42.375
I wasn't expecting any guests.
You want a nightcap or something?

57:42.459 --> 57:46.379
No, I'm good, I'm good.
I think I just need to sleep. Whoa...

57:46.463 --> 57:48.464
Fair enough.

57:50.425 --> 57:52.426
You still live here, man?

57:52.427 --> 57:53.928
Yeah, used to...

57:54.054 --> 57:55.930
Long time ago.

57:59.518 --> 58:01.686
The bedrooms are upstairs.

58:01.812 --> 58:04.772
You, uh,
make yourself at home.

58:08.193 --> 58:09.652
Okay.

58:25.335 --> 58:26.586
(Clock ticking)

59:02.789 --> 59:04.749
Squeeze a cheek, mister.
Come on.

59:05.500 --> 59:06.500
(Groans)
Oh...

59:08.420 --> 59:09.420
Oh, god...

59:29.816 --> 59:31.525
I gotta ask you something.

59:31.652 --> 59:33.611
Franny...

59:34.947 --> 59:37.531
I'm exhausted, man. I just...
I can't, I can't...

59:37.532 --> 59:39.992
Go to sleep.
No one's bombin' ya.

59:41.119 --> 59:42.536
Go to sleep.

59:46.333 --> 59:47.708
You know...

59:50.128 --> 59:51.879
I have a...

59:54.549 --> 59:57.093
I never wanted to be
close to anyone.

59:59.805 --> 01:00:03.099
I've always wanted people
to love me.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.768
Everyone.

01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:15.569
It's not a coincidence, is it?
That you're here.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:17.530
We're together again.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.783
It isn't...

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:29.083
Bobby, you and Mia were the
only ones I ever got close to.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:34.547
I never wanted to get close
to anyone. You know that.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.929
I didn't tell.

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:46.809
I didn't tell anybody.
I didn't tell anybody what happened.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.769
I didn't tell anybody.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:53.107
I didn't tell anyone
it was my fault.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:01.365
Do you remember?
Do you remember what happened, Bobby?

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.835
It should've been me, Bobby,
not you. You had everything.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.546
It was...
It should've been me.

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.156
Franny?

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.951
Franny?

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:38.379
(Sighing deeply)

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.047
(Door opening)

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:43.717
Hey, Franny.
Sam. Been a while.

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.511
It sure has.

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:46.804
You're looking pretty good.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:48.222
Cut the shit.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:54.311
You know, I got embarrassed
at the pharmacy the other day.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:57.064
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm really sorry about that.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.817
Well?
Well, I've been trying to reach you for months.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.902
And you're impossible to get
hold of, Franny.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:04.864
Since when
do we need to talk?

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:09.743
Okay, going forward, I...

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:13.372
I can't sign off
on any more refills.

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:16.417
Your recovery period has been
drawn out too long already.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:22.256
(Scoffs)

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:25.384
I left messages. (Whispering)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.766
I've been pretty good
to you, haven't I, Sam?

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:35.394
I'm pretty good. To you.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.688
Regulations have changed.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:40.191
You're taking a controlled substance.
I can get into a lot of trouble.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:44.695
You have to understand that.
You got me on this. You kept it going.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:47.198
And now you're pulling
the plug to save your ass?

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:50.117
We both have a part in this.
That is not what is happening here.

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.160
We both... You are my doctor!

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:53.245
And that's exactly
what's happening!

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.414
It's exactly what
has happened!

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:57.124
Sam.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.293
(Exhales sharply)

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:01.086
Sam.

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:04.298
I don't feel well.

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:06.008
I don't feel well.

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:08.719
I don't feel well at all.

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:11.096
I know. Okay, okay, listen.
Listen, I understand.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:12.097
(Shivering)

01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:14.725
I understand, okay.
This is what I'm gonna do.

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:16.169
I'm gonna do something. Okay.
Okay.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.854
I'm gonna write you
a prescription

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:23.317
for something called Tramadol and it's
gonna help wean you off Hydromorphone.

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:26.529
I'm also gonna let you
take home some Klonopin.

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:27.947
That's gonna help you
with your nerves, okay?

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:31.825
Are you fucking joking? What is this?
What... What are you talking about?

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.494
What are you
fucking doing to me?

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:36.372
(Panting) Sam, what is it?

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:39.667
You need more money?
I don't pay you enough?

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:42.127
Is that it? I can...
Listen.

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:43.921
I can give you whatever you want.
Doesn't matter to me.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:48.342
I think the best option
for you right now is rehab.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:52.221
It is very discreet, and they're
gonna take very good care of you.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.268
I'm 60 years old.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.979
I'm 60 years old.
I'm in a lot of pain.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.566
I'm not a drug addict.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.195
I'm not a drug addict.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:11.865
Help me.

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:16.579
Please.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.260
(Water running)

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:17.931
(Cars honking)

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:19.933
(Sirens wailing)

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:24.396
(Indistinct yelling)

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:13.237
It's Franny, yeah.
Listen, I'm really sorry about...

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.990
Yeah, I didn't wanna call you
at home I just... Yeah.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:20.369
Yeah, no. It's my leg, my leg.
No, just my leg.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.204
Yeah.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:25.999
No, no. I said I'm not going to rehab.
No, I'm not gonna do that.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.627
Sam, come on.
Be reasonable, Sam.

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:32.005
It's five years. I...
I know what the fuck I need. I know that!

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:35.843
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Wait, wait, wait... No, I can't.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:36.969
I can't come in tomorrow.
No.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.179
Now! Let's do it now.
Just call it in.

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.515
Just call it in.
Just call it in, please, just...

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:51.442
Call it in. Call it in!
Call it in! Just call it in! Call it.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:20.029
(Grunting)
Stupid, stupid. Careless.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:21.698
(Grunts)

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:23.617
(Breathing heavily)

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.662
I'm gonna need something
heavy duty for this, doc.

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:28.788
I'll send you home with
some ibuprofen.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.251
Ibuprofen?
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:35.546
What, you kidding me?
Come on, are you kidding?

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:39.258
No. No, no. I'm...
I'm in a lot of pain here.

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:41.218
You don't understand.
This... This is serious.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.845
Sir, I need you to sit back.

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.763
(Sighs deeply)

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.059
What about Hydromorphone?

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:52.145
I mean, look at this wound.
That's probably a better idea, isn't it?

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:53.229
Would that be
a better choice for this?

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:56.149
I'm in a lot of pain. I'm in a lot of pain.
Let me just finish this

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:57.350
and we can get
you checked out.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:10:00.070
Don't patronize me.
Don't play dumb.

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:01.321
Look, I could go out
in the lobby there.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.657
I'm sure I could find
at least one or two homeboys

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.617
that'd be more than happy
to help me score some dope.

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:09.162
But I am not a junkie.
Look at me. I am not a junkie.

01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:10.414
I don't wanna take it
to the streets.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.250
I'm just looking for
clinical-grade pharmaceuticals

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.002
to ease my pain!

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:18.088
This is a hospital,
for Christ's sake, not a bodega!

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:19.715
I'm not looking for Tylenol.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:21.174
Can you help me?

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.093
Are you a nurse?
Are you a doctor?

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.220
What the fuck are you?
Can you help?

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:27.806
(Sirens wailing)

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:39.401
(Engine revving)

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.389
Franny, what are you doing?

01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.059
Franny.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:16.229
I'm here to see Toby.
I want to see him.

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:18.357
Franny, what happened to you?

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:21.985
Okay, I'm here. I'm he...

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:24.446
Toby?

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:27.616
Toby? Where is he?
Where is he?

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:30.577
Where's Toby?

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:35.916
I told him I'd be here. It's important.
He believes me when I tell him.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:37.834
Toby.

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:40.379
Toby.

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:43.173
Hang on, where are you?

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:45.425
Where is he?
Where's Toby?

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:47.551
Where is he?
What happened to him? He was in there.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:51.056
Can you talk to me? You are useless.
I mean... Luke. Lukie!

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.349
(Baby crying)
Come on, Luke.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.059
Luke! I want Luke!

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:57.229
Franny...
Lukie! I want... Get away from me!

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.357
Who the fuck...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:02.025
(Struggling)
Relax.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.403
Don't call the police!
We're fine! (Yelling)

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:06.279
I want to know
who's responsible.

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:07.948
For what?
Tell me!

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.074
Toby? What?
Toby's fine!

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.200
Toby's dead!

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:11.284
No, he's not!
You're lying!

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:12.202
He's fine!
Don't you lie to me!

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:14.371
He's not lying to you. He's not lying to you.
He's fine, all right?

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.124
He's post op.
He doesn't need to be here. He's okay.

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:19.668
He's fine.
Show me.

01:12:19.794 --> 01:12:21.294
We're gonna take
five minutes, okay?

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:22.815
All right, get him
out of here, please.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.298
Let's move...
Come on.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:32.639
(Sighs)

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:35.100
I'm not gonna try
and relate to you, Franny.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.145
Because I can't, all right?

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:40.147
I don't think anyone can.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:42.482
But you need help.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.317
All right?
You're a morphine addict.

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:45.944
And that is not
your biggest problem.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:50.323
So either you go get help,
or you stay the fuck away from my family.

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.742
Do you understand me?

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.288
Did you say something to her?

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.207
What?
Did you say something to her?

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.334
Did you say... Do you think
you can get between her and me?

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:03.837
Did you say something?
You think it's gonna help? Because it's not.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:06.506
She wants me in her life.
She wants you?

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:09.217
And you've got a problem, buddy.
You are jealous.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.344
And you're weak and you can't
do anything on your...

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.346
How do you think you got here?
Because I said so.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.515
You have a job
because I said so.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:16.725
You can't do anything
on your own.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:19.644
You can't even take care
of your family without me.

01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:21.897
(Grunts)
Do you wanna get me fired, huh?

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.566
(Grunts) You wanna get me fired?
Go ahead, all right?

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:27.069
I don't want a thing
from you, all right?

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:28.278
We don't need you.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:29.446
(Grunts)

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:34.284
You don't have problems.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:36.369
You don't have real problems.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:41.583
Just because you give and give and
give doesn't make you a part of anything.

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:44.211
It just gives you an
excuse to be a coward.

01:13:44.796 --> 01:13:46.588
You are not a good person.

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:48.548
You're a junkie with guilt.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:50.926
Look at you.

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:53.706
Were you always
like this, Franny?

01:13:53.805 --> 01:13:56.932
(Breathing heavily)
(Sniffling)

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:01.186
(Door opens)

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:04.648
(Door shuts)

01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:12.239
(Panting)

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:16.868
(Knocking)
Franny.

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:19.412
(Knocking)
Franny.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.084
(Doorbell rings)

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.892
(Knocking)

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.145
Franny.

01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:48.316
(Knocking)
I can see you, Franny.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.443
What?

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:57.617
I'm coming.
(Clearing throat)

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:00.620
(Clears throat)

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:03.498
Hey!

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:07.335
Hey! Hey, all right.
Come on in. What're you doing here?

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.421
Come on. Hey.

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:17.387
Hey, I'm sorry about the mess.
I don't know what happened. I just...

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:19.264
(Cat meows)

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.891
You need to get help, Franny.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.059
What?

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:25.645
I want to help you.

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:26.980
I want to be here
for you this time.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:30.442
Aah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
No, you're not.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.489
We're moving out of the house.

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:43.163
We don't belong there.

01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:44.664
We're leaving.
Wa... Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.666
You can't...
(Exhales sharply)

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:47.959
It... It's just too new.

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:50.565
You just need some time, make it your own.
It's not new for me.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.216
I know what you're doing.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.720
We shouldn't have
started this. It's my fault.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:01.514
I just want to make things right.
I'm sorry.

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.516
I just want to make
things right.

01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:05.644
I can't have you
in my baby's life.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:09.481
Not like this.

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:14.945
When I was a kid,
I looked up to you.

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:20.825
What happened?

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.833
You're not the only one
who lost them.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:33.338
(Sobbing)

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.382
I'm ready to help you.

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:41.763
But I will not keep feeling
sorry for you.

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.016
You need to grow up.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:50.230
I need to grow up?

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:53.775
I need to grow up?
(Whimpering)

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:01.199
What right do you have
to come into my house

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:03.535
and speak to me like that?

01:17:07.707 --> 01:17:10.667
You're just a little girl
that got knocked up.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.294
You're not a princess.
(Crying)

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.130
(Sniffs)
Please stop.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:17.799
You want space?
Go on, take your space. Get out of here.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:20.093
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:22.595
You're not Mia
and you'll never be Mia.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:25.682
(Sniffling)

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:29.853
(Door shuts)

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:51.958
(Exhales sharply)

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.004
Poodles!

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:58.673
(Breathing heavily)
Poodles, wait!

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:02.969
Poodles, I'm so sorry, okay?
Stop, stop.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:05.722
Poodles! Stop, honey.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.557
Stop! I'm so sorry.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.226
Stop.
You're right. You're right.

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:11.728
I'm just a fucking loser.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:13.980
Look at me. I'm just...

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.650
What's that?
What's wrong?

01:18:17.777 --> 01:18:20.653
What's the matter?
What happened?

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:23.615
Wait a minute. Are you okay?
Just get me to the doctor.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:25.909
(Engine revving)

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:28.703
(Tires squealing)

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:36.503
Hey, do you know
where Luke is?

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:39.589
Franny... Franny, we can't have this again.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:40.840
No, I'm past that.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:43.259
I know. I'm disgusting...
Yes.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:43.802
...and my problems are petty.

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:46.679
And I gotta work on my...

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.183
My coping skills, I know that.
But Olivia's down in the ER.

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:52.018
I gotta find Luke.

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:55.063
Dr. Harris?

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:57.748
That was an apology,
you got that, right?

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:00.527
Dr. Harris.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:03.488
Yeah?

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:05.698
Jesus Christ.

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:07.367
Hey!
You kidding me, Franny?

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:09.035
Toby! Hey, man.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.162
Good to see you.
You're looking good.

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:12.831
What are you doing here,
Franny?

01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:14.207
Olivia's down in the ER.

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.376
She wants to see you.
She'd like to see you.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:19.087
What? She needs to see you.
It's all right.

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:22.715
She's fine. It's just she... She's with a doctor.
What happened?

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:23.967
She might be in labor.

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:32.225
You know,
I wasn't always like this.

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:34.477
I used to be pretty cool.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.729
Yeah, I'll take
your word for it.

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.064
(Elevator doors opening)

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:39.774
Thanks for taking care of this.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:41.860
Hey.
What?

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.738
Am I too old for rehab?

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.242
You're too old for Molly.

01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:56.249
Yeah.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.114
Mr. Watts.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.410
Mr. Watts.
(Gasping)

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:34.537
Everything okay?

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:35.705
It's a boy.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:38.208
A boy?

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:41.377
Yeah, he's just a little bit early,
but everything's fine.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:42.587
They asked to see you.

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:47.467
They did?
Yeah.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.803
(Chuckles)

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:04.817
This is Robert.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:07.654
(Baby crying)

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:08.947
Is he a Robert?

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:10.865
Yeah, you wanna meet him?

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:15.954
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:17.497
Come on.

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:34.389
Wow.

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:38.351
(Baby whining)

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:40.019
Could I have a moment with him?

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:42.313
A moment?
Yeah.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.566
Uh, yeah, sure.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:56.035
(Baby crying)

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:19.392
I'm so sorry, Bobby.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:23.104
I'm so sorry.

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:28.776
Mr. Watts?

01:24:19.096 --> 01:24:20.680
(Robert gurgling)
