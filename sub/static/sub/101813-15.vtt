WEBVTT

00:16.799 --> 00:18.931
Let me get that.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.411
Come on.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.645
Why is he hurting the horse?

00:37.472 --> 00:39.343
Oh, he ain't hurting the horse.

00:39.387 --> 00:40.431
He's breaking him.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.477
Breaking him?

00:43.956 --> 00:44.957
Yep.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.568
That's what we call

00:46.611 --> 00:48.004
training a horse.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.094
He looks scared.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.878
He is.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.619
But that's because they took him
from his herd.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.057
Why'd they take him away?

00:58.580 --> 01:00.669
Well, the herds get too big,

01:00.712 --> 01:04.020
and the wild horses-- well,
they gobble up all the food

01:04.064 --> 01:05.326
before the native animals

01:05.369 --> 01:06.762
like deer can eat.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.808
So he just misses his family.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.203
Yeah.

01:13.247 --> 01:15.075
He does.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.642
But the hurt won't last forever,
Thomas.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.036
He'll be happy again.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.908
It's just gonna take time, <i>
mijo.</i>

01:26.999 --> 01:28.958
<i>Wasn't till later that
I realized Uncle Bernardo wasn't</i>

01:29.001 --> 01:30.916
just talking about the horse,
right?

01:30.960 --> 01:32.266
Those words were meant for me.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.746
'Cause you'd just
lost your dad.
Yeah.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.314
First time I went to the ranch
was right after my father died,

01:37.358 --> 01:39.534
and my mom thought I could use
a change of scenery.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.971
I mean, I lost myself there.

01:42.014 --> 01:45.061
And Bernardo became
like a father figure to me.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.150
He never wanted
a family of his own?

01:48.020 --> 01:50.197
No, he used to say
he was married to the land.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.503
So, he's with someone now,
right?

01:52.547 --> 01:54.418
Yeah, but they've only been
together for a couple weeks.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.159
I mean, I hope it works out.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.640
He could use somebody other than
livestock to talk to, you know.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.296
Oh, it's Higgy.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.298
Hey, all right,
before you say anything,

02:04.341 --> 02:05.821
I will pay you back
for the cheese.

02:05.864 --> 02:06.996
All right?
I just thought, uh...

02:07.039 --> 02:08.998
Roberto II could use
a little break

02:09.041 --> 02:10.739
from his mouse chow.

02:10.782 --> 02:13.263
Well, I wasn't aware that you'd
raided my fridge yet again,

02:13.307 --> 02:15.309
but I hope you realize
that my pule cheese

02:15.352 --> 02:17.659
fetches $600 a pound.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.313
$600?

02:19.356 --> 02:21.315
Where does it come from,
golden calves?

02:21.358 --> 02:22.925
Donkeys, actually.

02:22.968 --> 02:25.014
Anyway, the reason I called you
is to let you know

02:25.057 --> 02:26.102
that I've prepared
the historic Honu Room

02:26.146 --> 02:27.495
for your uncle's visit.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.540
The Honu Room? Wow.

02:29.584 --> 02:30.846
That is the one place

02:30.889 --> 02:32.543
on the estate
that you throw a tantrum

02:32.587 --> 02:33.805
if I go anywhere near.

02:33.849 --> 02:34.980
Yes, but it's only

02:35.024 --> 02:36.199
because of the fragility

02:36.243 --> 02:37.200
of the antiques
contained within.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.202
I'm just certain that your uncle

02:39.246 --> 02:41.161
knows how to comport himself.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.772
Well, thank you for rolling out
the red carpet for my uncle.

02:43.815 --> 02:46.383
You're welcome. I'm looking
forward to meeting him tomorrow.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.733
Anyway, Ethan and I are
in the middle of a game

02:48.777 --> 02:50.082
of chess, so I better get going.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.867
All right, you do that.
Night, Higgy.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.390
Night, Magnum.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.219
You make your move yet?

02:56.263 --> 02:59.527
What, and let you miss out
on this genius mastery?

02:59.570 --> 03:01.006
Not a chance.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.361
You know what that means.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.450
How'd you get so good
at chess anyway?

03:09.493 --> 03:10.581
Um...

03:10.625 --> 03:13.149
There was a period of two years

03:13.193 --> 03:15.369
where I played
nearly every day.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.761
With your father?

03:17.588 --> 03:19.721
With Richard, actually.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.592
Oh.

03:22.419 --> 03:25.030
You know, it's okay
to say his name

03:25.074 --> 03:27.163
and talk about him.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.079
I mean, he was a big part
of your life.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.953
What?

03:37.608 --> 03:39.044
There is...

03:39.088 --> 03:43.266
something that I've been wanting
to tell you.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.920
Um...

03:44.963 --> 03:48.532
I've just been waiting
for the right moment.

03:50.317 --> 03:54.625
Richard didn't die
in an accident.

03:54.669 --> 03:57.628
And before I was
a majordomo

03:57.672 --> 04:00.152
or a private investigator,

04:00.196 --> 04:04.940
I had another profession.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.912
This here's
the torque indicator.

04:20.956 --> 04:24.829
Obviously it lets you know how
much power the engine's using.

04:27.615 --> 04:28.790
-Earth to Major Sham.
-Sorry.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.879
It's just not every day
I get treated

04:30.922 --> 04:33.490
to a sweet-ass view like this.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.319
Yeah, about that.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.800
I was thinking... Hey, check it out.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.715
There's a couple of
thrill-seekers

04:40.758 --> 04:42.194
on the Haiku Stairs.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.761
Hey, that thing's still
off-limits, ain't it?

04:43.805 --> 04:44.762
Yep.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.111
Probably tourists.

04:46.155 --> 04:49.158
Well, anyway, as I was saying,

04:49.201 --> 04:51.900
there's a reason I'm
going over the controls.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.380
Business is picking up,

04:53.423 --> 04:54.903
and I could use
another pilot

04:54.946 --> 04:57.166
to take some of the weight off.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.386
I was thinking it could be you.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.869
That's a nice offer,

05:04.913 --> 05:06.654
but piloting is gonna be
a little tricky

05:06.697 --> 05:08.177
without the use of these.

05:08.220 --> 05:11.354
It's the
21st century, brother.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.879
I'll have this bird retrofitted
so you can fly it.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.926
What do you say?

05:17.969 --> 05:21.103
Uh, look,
I appreciate the offer.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.366
Uh, can I think about it?

05:23.410 --> 05:25.673
Yeah, of course.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.892
Thanks.

05:38.033 --> 05:41.384
Aloha, and welcome to Honolulu
International Airport.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.778
Please proceed to baggage claim
to collect all checked bags.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.867
-Thomas.

05:45.910 --> 05:48.086
Hey!

05:48.130 --> 05:49.827
Who are you, and what did you
do with my uncle?

05:49.871 --> 05:52.526
Oh, Ana convinced me to do
a bit of a makeover.

05:52.569 --> 05:53.831
A bit of a makeover?

05:53.875 --> 05:56.051
The vaquero I know sleeps
in 20-year-old Levi's

05:56.094 --> 05:57.661
and shaves twice a year.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.837
Well, the love of a good woman
will change you, <i>mijo.</i>

05:59.881 --> 06:01.056
Yeah, I guess so.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.363
Oh, uh, this is for you.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.540
-Mahalo. Huh?
-What?

06:06.583 --> 06:08.629
I learned that on the plane.

06:08.672 --> 06:09.804
That's pretty good.

06:09.847 --> 06:10.892
-Let's get out of here.
-Let's go.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.415
God, you are
looking good.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.939
You, like, shaved
20 years off you...

06:17.289 --> 06:18.769
<i>I don't get it.</i>

06:18.813 --> 06:21.337
I thought Sham would be excited
to become a pilot.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.817
I don't know.
Maybe it's the cost

06:22.860 --> 06:24.035
of retrofitting the chopper?

06:24.079 --> 06:26.429
Maybe he doesn't want
to put you out.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.952
Could be.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.606
You know what?

06:29.650 --> 06:30.955
My buddy's a machinist.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.566
I bet he'd do it on the cheap.

06:32.609 --> 06:35.438
I mean, no promises,
but he owes me one.

06:38.833 --> 06:39.877
Yo.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.445
Can you turn that up?
Yeah.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.449
The forbidden Haiku Stairs
have claimed the life

06:46.493 --> 06:48.451
of an unidentified female hiker,

06:48.495 --> 06:51.541
the first casualty at this
infamous trail in six years.

06:51.585 --> 06:54.109
Authorities believe
she was alone when she fell,

06:54.152 --> 06:56.459
so it could've been days
before she was found

06:56.503 --> 06:58.505
if it were not
for another pair of hikers.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.289
We were just about to set off

07:00.332 --> 07:02.552
when my husband spotted
a red backpack in the brush.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.119
Went to take a look,

07:04.162 --> 07:05.512
and that's when we found her.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.775
The Haiku Stairs also...

07:07.818 --> 07:10.473
We saw her.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.343
Who?

07:11.387 --> 07:13.476
The lady, the one that died.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.695
Me and Sham,

07:14.738 --> 07:16.479
we-we saw her from the
air this morning.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.873
Wait. You saw her from the air?
How do you know it was her?

07:18.916 --> 07:21.266
She had a red backpack.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.399
But she wasn't alone.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.488
There was a guy with her.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.490
Okay, well,
if somebody was with her,

07:27.534 --> 07:29.274
why didn't they call it in?

07:33.061 --> 07:35.803
Maybe her death wasn't
an accident.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.442
You live here?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.532
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty nice.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.882
Wow, I wish your mom

08:11.926 --> 08:13.449
was here to see you.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.541
I hope I'm not interrupting.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.848
Oh, Higgy.
Uh, this is...

08:20.891 --> 08:22.284
Bernardo, I presume. Hi.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.329
I'm Juliet Higgins.
Welcome to Robin's Nest.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.636
Thank you. It's so nice
to finally meet you.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.724
I've heard so much.

08:27.768 --> 08:28.986
Yeah, well,
don't believe a word.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.118
All good things,

08:30.161 --> 08:31.467
I promise.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.904
My nephew has told me about

08:33.948 --> 08:35.253
all your great adventures,

08:35.297 --> 08:36.341
and that you're
an excellent business partner

08:36.385 --> 08:37.647
and a great roommate.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.127
Oh, well, that's
lovely to hear,

08:39.170 --> 08:40.737
um, but "roommate" is a bit

08:40.781 --> 08:42.565
of a mischaracterization.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.785
Technically,
since I...

08:44.828 --> 08:46.569
own Robin's Nest,

08:46.613 --> 08:48.876
I'm actually his landlord
and employer.

08:48.919 --> 08:51.487
Later you can ask her
about how that came to be,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.228
but I provide the excitement
here on the estate

08:53.271 --> 08:54.403
through our detective service,

08:54.446 --> 08:56.797
which is really
the bread and butter

08:56.840 --> 08:58.407
of the whole operation.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.756
I don't know, the books might
indicate otherwise,

08:59.800 --> 09:01.584
plus we're equal partners,
Thomas.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.065
Yeah, but you wouldn't even be
a detective if it wasn't for me.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.894
If it wasn't for me, you'd be
both homeless and carless.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.504
Listen,
anyway, sorry.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.246
I have some, uh, estate
business I have to attend to,

09:11.289 --> 09:12.421
but do make yourself at home.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.422
Thank you.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.598
You gents have a lovely day.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.601
She's, uh, such
a sweetheart.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.124
Wow.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.735
You sound like
an old married couple.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.172
If that's what marriage is like,
I am never getting hitched.

09:24.215 --> 09:27.436
What if I told you I am?

09:27.479 --> 09:29.656
You're what?
Getting married?

09:29.699 --> 09:32.136
-You kidding me?
-That's why I came down here.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.790
So I could tell you in person.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.750
I-I thought you were only dating
this woman for a couple weeks.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.100
Yeah, but once I met Ana,

09:39.143 --> 09:41.276
I knew I couldn't
let her get away.

09:41.319 --> 09:43.147
Well, this calls
for a celebration.
Yes.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.845
There's no tequila
in the cellar,

09:44.888 --> 09:46.760
but, uh, you know,
let's grab a bottle of wine,

09:46.803 --> 09:48.239
I'll just give you,
give you a tour.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.154
All right, great.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.329
-Married, huh?
-Wow.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.331
-This is awesome.
-Yeah.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.117
<i>Look, I'm telling you,</i>

09:56.160 --> 09:57.292
she wasn't alone.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.598
There was another hiker.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.121
And I find it pretty suspicious

10:00.164 --> 10:02.166
that he hasn't
come forward.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.996
What if he pushed her off?

10:06.040 --> 10:07.781
I believe you, TC.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.870
But for all you know,
they weren't together.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.655
They were practically
side by side on those steps.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.265
Look, maybe he was passing her

10:14.309 --> 10:15.310
or one of them turned back
before the other.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.225
Gordie.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.574
I feel it in my gut.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.315
Something ain't right
about this.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.709
Okay, look.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.493
I can ask the M.E.
to fast-track the autopsy,

10:24.536 --> 10:26.669
and I'll check in with the
detectives handling the case.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.193
But for now,
that's all I can do.

10:31.413 --> 10:32.762
Okay, I get it.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.026
Thanks.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.462
You bet.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.000
Thomas.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.089
Hey, man, you busy?

10:55.132 --> 10:57.961
I think I need to hire
a private investigator.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.055
<i>Well, it looks like
our deceased,</i>

11:05.099 --> 11:06.883
Crystal Lockhart,
was an avid hiker.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.233
Her social media is full
of pictures of her

11:09.277 --> 11:10.713
on trails all over the island.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.149
Oh, so she knew
what she was doing.

11:12.193 --> 11:14.108
Which means it's less likely
to be an accident.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.458
Okay, well, records indicate
that Crystal was unmarried.

11:16.501 --> 11:17.851
She has a...

11:17.894 --> 11:20.288
father, Raymond Lockhart,
who lives in Waimanalo

11:20.331 --> 11:21.724
with her brother Gabe.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.117
We should talk to them.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.771
They might know
who the other hiker is.

11:24.814 --> 11:25.902
Agreed.

11:25.946 --> 11:28.600
Oh, but, um,
TC and I can handle it.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.038
You should, uh,
spend some time with Bernardo.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.474
Oh. I'm fine.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.041
If you got to work...

11:34.084 --> 11:35.564
No, no. No, I insist.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.348
Thomas has been looking forward
to your visit for weeks.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.263
Yeah,

11:39.307 --> 11:40.961
Higgy's right.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.223
If we need backup,
we'll let you know.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.746
Thank you, guys.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.105
Hey.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.541
You okay?

11:56.585 --> 11:59.153
Yeah. I thought
it was Ethan,

11:59.196 --> 12:01.198
but it's just Kumu.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.679
Something going
on with him?

12:05.028 --> 12:08.728
Last night I, uh,
I opened up about my past.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.339
You told him about
your MI6 days?

12:11.382 --> 12:13.863
About that,
Richard's death,

12:13.907 --> 12:17.867
my vendetta, being disavowed,
the whole thing.

12:17.911 --> 12:21.349
Been trying to contact him
all day, but he's ignoring me.

12:21.392 --> 12:25.092
I'm sure he's
just in surgery.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.963
Perhaps.

12:36.233 --> 12:39.019
Good afternoon, Mr. Lockhart.
We're sorry to bother you.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.542
Look, I don't know
what you're selling,

12:40.585 --> 12:42.370
but it's not the best time.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.067
We're here about your daughter.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.549
<i>You're saying</i>

12:47.592 --> 12:49.725
my sister was with someone?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.858
Crystal always hiked alone.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.685
It was how she decompressed.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.819
Not today. I saw it
with my own eyes.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.342
Police said it was an accident.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.257
-We're not jumping
to any conclusions.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.476
It may have been.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.738
In the meantime,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.044
can you think of
anyone who may have wanted

13:04.087 --> 13:07.569
to harm her?
An ex-boyfriend or a coworker?

13:07.612 --> 13:11.138
She wasn't seeing anyone.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.227
And if she had a problem
with somebody,

13:13.270 --> 13:14.750
she never said.

13:18.406 --> 13:22.453
Okay, uh, we don't want to
take up any more of your time.

13:24.542 --> 13:25.848
We're very sorry for your loss.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.416
Well, I appreciate you
looking into it.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.897
And, please, keep us posted.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.724
Of course.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.427
<i>So Thomas was learning</i>

13:39.470 --> 13:40.994
how to ride his
bike, right?

13:41.037 --> 13:43.257
But he couldn't turn yet,
and so we're on this path,

13:43.300 --> 13:45.825
and we get to a certain point
where you have to turn left

13:45.868 --> 13:47.609
or right, and he yells,

13:47.652 --> 13:48.915
"I can't turn!"

13:50.003 --> 13:51.743
And he goes right
into the lake!

13:51.787 --> 13:53.528
Explains the way
he drives now.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.095
-Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.749
I gotta take this.
I'll be right back.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.840
Thomas Magnum.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.974
Uh, this afternoon?

14:06.019 --> 14:08.151
Yeah, I don't think I'm
gonna be able to make it.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.936
But let me reach out
to a colleague of mine,

14:09.979 --> 14:11.459
see if he's available.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.809
Okay. Be in touch.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.072
Mahalo.

14:17.508 --> 14:18.901
Okay, okay, okay,
what'd you tell them?

14:18.945 --> 14:21.121
Oh, nothing you
wouldn't have shared.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.557
In a confessional.

14:24.341 --> 14:25.473
I leave for one work call,

14:25.516 --> 14:26.691
and you start spilling
all my secrets.

14:26.735 --> 14:27.823
So what, you got a case?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.129
Yeah, it's an
infidelity stakeout,

14:29.172 --> 14:31.348
but I'm probably gonna
hand it off to Luther.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.784
Hold on.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.135
Don't pass up a paying job.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.353
Do it.

14:36.397 --> 14:37.267
You sure?

14:37.311 --> 14:38.834
I'll tag along.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.140
I've always wanted to see
what you do for a living.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.968
All right.
Well, my client's husband

14:42.011 --> 14:45.667
goes to lunch in an hour,
and she wants us to tail him,

14:45.710 --> 14:47.060
so we should
probably get going.

14:47.103 --> 14:50.498
Me, too. I got to get back
to the cultural center.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.152
-All right, I'll see you guys.
-Bye.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.153
Bye, guys.

14:55.503 --> 14:56.939
Oh, hey.
Good news, Sham.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.028
My buddy Jack,
he's a machinist.

14:59.072 --> 15:02.075
He said he'll retrofit
the chopper for a big discount.

15:03.511 --> 15:07.602
But, uh, TC, he told me the
plan for you to become a pilot.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.780
That's TC's plan.
I didn't accept the job.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.477
And I definitely didn't ask
for help.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.567
Oh, sorry, man, I just figured
you'd be worried about the cost.

15:16.611 --> 15:17.699
Well, you figured wrong.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.962
Hey, come on, man, take it easy.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.485
Look, I understand
why you'd be hesitant,

15:21.529 --> 15:23.835
but come on, you can do this.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.750
It's not like
you've got to fly a chopper

15:25.794 --> 15:28.101
-standing up, right?
-Look, you don't get it, okay?

15:29.058 --> 15:30.625
You can't get it.

15:30.668 --> 15:31.669
All right.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.193
Sham...

15:33.236 --> 15:36.022
Sham, come on, man.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.297
I'll search

15:50.340 --> 15:52.603
the other rooms.

15:58.479 --> 16:01.873
Yo. Come check this out.

16:01.917 --> 16:04.441
Got newspaper clippings,

16:04.485 --> 16:06.095
police reports.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.879
I think Crystal
was looking into

16:07.923 --> 16:10.447
an unsolved murder.

16:10.491 --> 16:11.927
Raina Kahui.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.234
Killed last year.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.628
This wasn't just any case
for Crystal.

16:19.065 --> 16:22.285
There's a couple of photos
with Raina in them.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.115
Seems like they were close.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.685
Crystal was investigating
her friend's murder.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.687
And now she ends up dead.

16:32.730 --> 16:35.255
What does Thomas say
about coincidences?

16:35.298 --> 16:38.301
A good detective
doesn't believe in them.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.531
It says Raina was stabbed
six times.

16:50.574 --> 16:53.447
It's likely a
crime of passion.

16:53.490 --> 16:58.104
I can't stop thinking about
seeing Crystal on those stairs.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.932
I flew right over
a murder about to happen.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.457
You couldn't have known that.
You know that, right?

17:11.508 --> 17:13.597
Look, one of Crystal's
most recent notes

17:13.641 --> 17:15.077
says "Harada."

17:15.121 --> 17:17.340
You think that could have been
Raina's killer?

17:17.384 --> 17:20.343
Perhaps, but it says here
that Chad Cabrera,

17:20.387 --> 17:23.085
a tool company owner
and Raina's ex-boyfriend

17:23.129 --> 17:24.956
and employer,
was the prime suspect.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.090
They just didn't have enough
evidence to arrest him.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.874
Wait a second.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.485
What?

17:31.528 --> 17:33.791
Look here.

17:33.835 --> 17:37.534
Crystal just paid Cabrera
a visit, just yesterday.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.536
I suppose we pick up
where she left off.

17:42.148 --> 17:45.716
I don't see any movement.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.066
Oh, hey, uh...

17:47.109 --> 17:49.198
take a picture for Ana.

17:49.242 --> 17:52.245
Come on,
-she'll get a kick out of it.
-All right.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.640
Okay, I got it.

17:56.684 --> 17:59.513
I still can't believe
you're settling down.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.254
Yeah, well,
maybe you should think about it.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.820
You're not getting any younger.

18:02.864 --> 18:06.302
Yeah, that usually requires
the right woman.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.695
What about Juliet?

18:07.738 --> 18:09.827
No, no, no, no, no.
Juliet and I

18:09.871 --> 18:11.394
are-are just business partners.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.136
I've never seen business
partners bicker like that.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.269
-It's our dynamic.
-It's chemistry.

18:16.312 --> 18:19.881
No, no. You got it all wrong.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.275
Higgins and I are just friends.

18:22.318 --> 18:23.972
That's how it starts.

18:24.015 --> 18:26.757
No, no. I-I can't believe you're
giving me relationship advice,

18:26.801 --> 18:29.064
and you're in love
for the first time

18:29.108 --> 18:31.327
at, like, 60.

18:31.371 --> 18:33.590
No, not... for the first time.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.723
What are you talking about?
Why didn't you tell me?

18:39.379 --> 18:41.555
Wait, ho-hold on, we're
gonna have to put that on hold.

18:41.598 --> 18:44.514
That's our client's husband,
Ed Skinner.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.689
Is he going to see his mistress?

18:45.733 --> 18:47.343
Well, that's what
his wife thinks.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.172
He's been skipping out
on these long lunches.

18:51.347 --> 18:52.827
We're just

18:52.870 --> 18:55.482
gonna have to tail him,
see where he goes.

18:58.702 --> 18:59.790
Hi there.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.228
-Hi. How can I help you?
-We would like

19:02.271 --> 19:05.535
to talk to Chad Cabrera about a
personalized adventure package.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.580
Sure.

19:06.623 --> 19:09.017
Let me see if he's free.
One sec.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.453
Thanks.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.466
-Right this way.
-Great.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.820
Aloha.
Chad Cabrera.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.736
-Thanks for squeezing us in.
-Yeah, absolutely.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.174
Uh, Jonah says that
you're looking for a...

19:35.217 --> 19:36.914
a personalized adventure?

19:36.958 --> 19:38.960
But before we get into it,
I'd love to know

19:39.003 --> 19:40.396
how you heard about us.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.138
Crystal Lockhart.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.358
She's a dear
friend of ours.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.403
Um...

19:48.970 --> 19:50.232
Uh, Jonah,

19:50.276 --> 19:53.279
can you, uh,
can you give us a minute?

19:56.630 --> 19:58.632
Crystal's been harassing me
for a year, and now she sends

19:58.675 --> 20:00.111
-other people to do it?
-Crystal was right

20:00.155 --> 20:02.244
to circle you
over Raina's murder.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.551
You were, after
all, ex-lovers.

20:04.594 --> 20:07.031
And you were never cleared
by HPD, because nobody

20:07.075 --> 20:08.381
could confirm
your alibi.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.427
I was home, alone.

20:11.471 --> 20:12.515
Mm-hmm.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.301
I did not kill Raina.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.172
How about Crystal?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.304
What are you talking about?

20:18.347 --> 20:19.740
Crystal was murdered

20:19.783 --> 20:20.784
this morning.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.265
She came to see
you yesterday,

20:23.309 --> 20:24.397
which makes you one of
the last people

20:24.440 --> 20:25.659
she spoke to before her death.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.404
Okay, I-I did not...
kill her, either.

20:31.447 --> 20:32.666
I've been
on a teleconference

20:32.709 --> 20:34.668
with a client in Michigan
all morning.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.626
I have the recording
to prove it.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.976
Great. We'd love to see it.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.326
You're not cops.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.545
I don't have to show you
anything. Now get out.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.563
I guess his wife was right.

21:00.607 --> 21:03.610
Yeah, we'd better catch up
before he gets to his room.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.844
Where is he going?

21:22.193 --> 21:23.891
Come on.

21:23.934 --> 21:27.373
♪ I've sunshine enough
to spread ♪

21:27.416 --> 21:29.331

21:34.554 --> 21:36.338

21:39.167 --> 21:40.386
Uh...

21:41.343 --> 21:43.345
It's great.
I've been taking lessons

21:43.389 --> 21:44.738
to surprise my wife
for our anniversary.

21:44.781 --> 21:47.958
-She has no idea.
Ready?

21:48.002 --> 21:50.309
Oh, that's my cue.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.358
Did not see that coming.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.365
And you really think we can
work all that into the budget?

22:03.409 --> 22:04.714
Oh, absolutely.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.281
How many people
is your group in total?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.891
Uh, well, roughly 63...

22:07.935 --> 22:09.719
Looks like
Chad's alibi checks out.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.068
Five faculty,

22:11.112 --> 22:12.461
-six chaperones.
-For today, at least.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.509
Oh, not to worry.
We have relationships... Look at the window

22:16.552 --> 22:17.727
behind Jonah.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.512
The bird?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.122
No. Keep watching.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.254
Far bigger groups...

22:25.126 --> 22:27.650
Oh. He looped his feed.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.217
He's a sneaky little bugger,

22:29.260 --> 22:30.566
isn't he?

22:32.002 --> 22:34.788
Seems like Jonah also did
some digging on Crystal

22:34.831 --> 22:36.877
right after we left
today. He was checking

22:36.920 --> 22:39.445
news feeds for information on
her death-- cause and suspects.

22:39.488 --> 22:40.881
Well, that's not

22:40.924 --> 22:42.491
suspicious at all.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.889
Mmm. It's even better
than I remember.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.587
<i>Torta ahogada</i> was always your
favorite when you were a kid.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.720
Man, this brings me back
to the ranch.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.461
I can almost
hear my mom yelling,

22:55.504 --> 22:56.940
"Save some for the rest of us!"

22:56.984 --> 22:59.160
She used to do
that all the time.

22:59.203 --> 23:01.597
Oh, man.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.730
-Mmm.
-So, uh,

23:03.773 --> 23:06.820
I've been, uh, wanting
to ask you something, Thomas.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.303
Will you be my best man?

23:12.347 --> 23:13.957
Of course!

23:14.001 --> 23:15.306
Yes! I'd be honored.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.134
Hey, well, look, man,

23:17.178 --> 23:19.441
if you're settling down,
I'm gonna need a front row seat.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.704
But don't think
I forgot, right?

23:21.748 --> 23:23.445
You have to tell me.
Who was she?

23:23.489 --> 23:25.621
This-this love of your life.

23:25.665 --> 23:28.189
What does it matter?

23:28.232 --> 23:29.625
The point is,

23:29.669 --> 23:30.626
I waited too long.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.585
We ran out of time.

23:34.978 --> 23:38.721
Don't make
the same mistake, <i>mijo.</i>

23:40.244 --> 23:41.942
Okay.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.987
You're still gonna tell me,
though.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.467
Who was she?

23:45.511 --> 23:47.861
Why is this so important?

23:47.904 --> 23:50.385
You know
I'm not gonna let this go.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.475
You can tell me.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.478
Come on.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.874
When your father passed,

24:00.917 --> 24:05.008
your mother and I--
we grieved together.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.881
Hold on. What are you...
what are you saying?

24:07.924 --> 24:09.535
We had to rely on each other.

24:09.578 --> 24:10.840
We got close.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.146
My mother?

24:12.189 --> 24:13.364
Thomas... So...

24:13.408 --> 24:14.757
so, she was mourning,

24:14.801 --> 24:16.367
and-and you took advantage
of her?

24:16.411 --> 24:17.630
No.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.198
No.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.026
It took over

24:23.070 --> 24:25.986
two decades before I actually
told her how I felt.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.770
And when I did,

24:27.814 --> 24:29.424
she said it was mutual.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.644
We didn't do anything wrong.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.384
Okay, if you didn't
do anything wrong,

24:33.428 --> 24:35.038
why would you keep it a secret?

24:35.082 --> 24:36.518
You were overseas.

24:36.562 --> 24:39.129
And-and we wanted
to tell you in person,

24:39.173 --> 24:40.566
but then you got taken.

24:40.609 --> 24:43.699
And we only had two years
together before she passed.

24:43.743 --> 24:47.616
And most of that time,
we were worried about you.

24:51.968 --> 24:54.797
Out of all the women
that you could've picked.

24:54.841 --> 24:57.147
I mean, she was...
she was married to your brother.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.149
I know.

24:59.193 --> 25:01.282
How could you do that?

25:01.325 --> 25:03.502
I struggled with that.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.460
She did, too.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.942
-It was complicated.
-Ah...

25:12.380 --> 25:13.424
I-I can't be here.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.514
<i>Mijo,</i> I...

25:35.098 --> 25:37.927
-Can I help you guys?
-Yeah. We need a word.

25:37.971 --> 25:40.060
We obtained a recording
of the teleconference you had

25:40.103 --> 25:42.366
this morning and detected
your rather clever ploy.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.586
Now, your editing might
have been good enough

25:44.630 --> 25:46.675
to fool Chad, but I'm afraid
it wasn't good enough for us.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.416
Which means
you could've been the one

25:48.459 --> 25:49.504
on that hike with Crystal.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.462
Why would I kill her?

25:51.506 --> 25:53.464
We don't know.
You seemed very uneasy

25:53.508 --> 25:55.466
when we mentioned
her name earlier.

25:56.990 --> 26:00.428
Okay, I admit I wasn't
on the meeting this morning,

26:00.471 --> 26:02.691
but for a totally legit reason.

26:02.735 --> 26:04.301
I had an interview

26:04.345 --> 26:05.694
at Waialua Snorkeling.

26:05.738 --> 26:06.782
If Chad found out,
he would have fired me.

26:06.826 --> 26:08.610
Look, you guys
got it all wrong.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.569
It wasn't me,
and it wasn't Chad.

26:10.612 --> 26:11.961
I mean, he's a crappy boss,

26:12.005 --> 26:13.746
but I know for a fact
that he didn't do it.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.748
And when Crystal
left here yesterday,

26:15.791 --> 26:18.577
-she knew it, too.
-How can you be so sure?

26:20.361 --> 26:22.624
Because I was with Chad
the night that Raina was killed.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.018
Hold up. Chad said
he was home alone.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.672
He wasn't.
Week after Raina dumped him,

26:26.715 --> 26:28.238
she got flowers at work.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.110
Chad spiraled, thought they were
from a new boyfriend.

26:30.153 --> 26:33.243
So he got drunk
at a bar that night,

26:33.287 --> 26:34.505
called me
to pick him up.

26:34.549 --> 26:35.855
Had me stop
at Raina's so he could

26:35.898 --> 26:37.639
convince her
to give him another shot.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.641
But when we got there,

26:39.685 --> 26:41.643
she was letting
some other guy inside,

26:41.687 --> 26:43.819
so Chad made me
take him home.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.782
If you could vouch for Chad,
then why didn't HPD clear him?

26:49.825 --> 26:51.610
Chad's on probation for a DUI.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.915
If he admitted

26:52.959 --> 26:54.656
to being at a bar,
they would have known he was

26:54.700 --> 26:55.875
in violation.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.267
He would've went to jail.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.747
You're clearly
not a great fan of Chad's.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.096
Why didn't you come forward?

27:00.140 --> 27:01.315
The man you saw
entering Raina's house

27:01.358 --> 27:02.838
could have been her killer.

27:02.882 --> 27:05.972
Only saw him for a second, tops.
Couldn't describe him

27:06.015 --> 27:07.364
if I tried.

27:07.408 --> 27:08.931
Still, your account
could've helped the police.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.718
Chad paid me to keep quiet.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.679
Raina must have known that man

27:17.723 --> 27:19.420
to let him willingly
into her house.

27:19.463 --> 27:23.337
Yeah. He could've been the one
that sent her flowers that day.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.383
And 19 florists in Waikiki.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.516
Okay, we're just gonna
have to go down the list.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.997
Or not.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.695
"Harada Floral."

27:33.739 --> 27:35.392
That was the last clue
that Crystal wrote down.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.917
We need to figure out
who sent those flowers.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.485
<i>I'm sorry, man.</i>

27:41.529 --> 27:43.836
The worst part about it is,
I'll never hear my mom's side

27:43.879 --> 27:46.273
of the story, you know,
what she was thinking.

27:46.316 --> 27:47.709
Look, I-I know this is hard,

27:47.753 --> 27:51.191
but it-it doesn't change
who your mom was.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.846
And Bernardo-- I mean, you said
it yourself-- he was like

27:53.889 --> 27:55.456
a dad to you, you know?

27:55.499 --> 27:57.719
They were just two good people
who happened to fall in love.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.721
Yeah, but he betrayed
his brother.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.723
Well, let me ask you this.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.377
Was your mom supposed
to die alone?

28:03.420 --> 28:05.379
I mean, look, it's not like
she stepped out on your dad.

28:05.422 --> 28:10.427
And he'd been dead for years
before Bernardo got involved.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.081
That doesn't make it okay.

28:12.125 --> 28:15.824
Look, when you needed
a man in your life,

28:15.868 --> 28:17.565
Bernardo was there.

28:17.608 --> 28:20.873
When your mother needed a man
in her life, Bernardo was there.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.744
Now, it's up to you. I just...

28:22.788 --> 28:25.225
I think you should
give the guy a break.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.665
<i>Okay. Appreciate your help.</i>

28:30.709 --> 28:32.188
Mahalo.

28:32.232 --> 28:33.624
Harada Floral

28:33.668 --> 28:36.845
says that Raina's flowers came
from Gabe Lockhart.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.586
-Crystal's brother?
-Uh-huh.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.501
So he might have
been the one going

28:40.544 --> 28:42.590
into Raina's the
night she died.

28:46.028 --> 28:48.204
Gordie, you got me and Higgins.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.903
Crystal Lockhart's
autopsy results came in.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.208
There are signs of a struggle.

28:52.252 --> 28:53.775
The M.E. found traces
of foreign DNA

28:53.819 --> 28:55.385
under Crystal's fingernails.

28:55.429 --> 28:56.778
You were right, TC.

28:56.822 --> 28:57.779
Someone threw her
off that ridge.

28:57.823 --> 28:58.780
Did you get a match

28:58.824 --> 28:59.912
in the system?

28:59.955 --> 29:01.043
No,

29:01.087 --> 29:02.741
but the DNA's a 50% match
to Crystal.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.787
Which means whoever did this is
an immediate family member.

29:05.831 --> 29:09.878
Siblings share,
on average, 50% DNA.

29:09.922 --> 29:12.707
It's not looking
good for Gabe.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.404
What are you guys talking about?

29:14.448 --> 29:15.754
Crystal was investigating

29:15.797 --> 29:17.320
her good friend
Raina Kahui's murder.

29:17.364 --> 29:20.454
Turns out that Crystal's brother
Gabe was a secret admirer,

29:20.497 --> 29:22.325
and he might
have killed her.

29:22.369 --> 29:25.589
We just found out he sent
Raina flowers the day she died.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.288
Also, one of the last notes
in Crystal's investigation

29:28.331 --> 29:31.073
was the name of the florist
who delivered those flowers.

29:31.117 --> 29:33.815
So it was only a matter of time
before Crystal's investigation

29:33.859 --> 29:37.166
into Raina's murder led
to her own brother.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.037
Exactly.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.474
So to protect himself,

29:40.517 --> 29:42.781
he killed his own sister.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.357
I'm sorry for your loss.

29:57.012 --> 30:00.233
I appreciate you coming
in to speak with me.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.539
Of course.

30:07.022 --> 30:10.591
Uh, I, uh... I thought
this was about Crystal?

30:10.634 --> 30:12.680
It is...

30:12.723 --> 30:17.728
but we believe Raina and
Crystal's murders are connected.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.910
You think he'll
take the bait?

30:24.953 --> 30:26.737
It's hard to tell.
I mean, he's gotten away

30:26.781 --> 30:28.261
With Raina's murder
for a year now.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.524
How well did you know Raina?

30:30.567 --> 30:32.831
I've known her my whole life.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.181
She was Crystal's

30:35.224 --> 30:36.747
best friend
since elementary school.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.837
So you and Raina
were friends, too?

30:38.880 --> 30:41.317
You could say that.

30:42.231 --> 30:45.931
She's very attractive.
You two ever more than friends?

30:48.411 --> 30:50.370
What are you getting at?

30:54.940 --> 30:57.899
I know you sent Raina flowers
on the day she was murdered.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.771
And I believe you went
to her place that night.

31:00.815 --> 31:04.558
Two witnesses saw her
let a man inside.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.560
Now, at the time,

31:06.603 --> 31:09.345
both had good reasons
not to come forward.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.391
But...

31:11.434 --> 31:14.524
you know, things
are different now.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.877
Hey,

31:18.920 --> 31:22.271
sometimes good people
make mistakes,

31:22.315 --> 31:24.360
but you got
to come clean.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.797
Help yourself

31:26.841 --> 31:29.365
by telling your side
of the story.

31:33.761 --> 31:37.286
I was never good with women.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.724
But Raina was different.

31:42.161 --> 31:43.684
She got me.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.774
I finally told her
how I felt,

31:46.817 --> 31:50.299
but she was seeing
a guy from work.

31:51.126 --> 31:54.129
Said that if she wasn't,

31:54.173 --> 31:56.044
maybe it'd be different.

31:56.088 --> 31:58.133
But eventually, they broke up,

31:58.177 --> 32:00.179
you saw your in,
sent her flowers,

32:00.222 --> 32:02.616
went to see her?

32:02.659 --> 32:05.314
She said
she didn't feel the same.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.972
Yeah, that must have hurt.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.455
Hey, it takes courage to
give your heart to somebody,

32:15.498 --> 32:18.458
only to have them break it.

32:21.504 --> 32:25.465
She was just staring at me

32:25.508 --> 32:28.207
with pity.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.731
Like I was just pathetic.

32:33.038 --> 32:36.432
And... and I lost it.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.046
And you killed her.

32:41.089 --> 32:43.004
She humiliated me.

32:45.006 --> 32:47.748
I was so angry.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.620
And the knife--
it was just right there...

32:58.019 --> 33:00.065
Gordie is good.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.502
He knew just how to
push his buttons.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.156
You know what?

33:04.199 --> 33:05.984
That part adds up for me.

33:09.596 --> 33:10.945
But murdering
your own sister?

33:11.946 --> 33:13.078
No.

33:13.121 --> 33:16.733
No, I-I loved Crystal.

33:17.821 --> 33:21.347
All right? She was
the only person in the world

33:21.390 --> 33:23.653
that believed in me.

33:23.697 --> 33:26.004
My only friend.

33:27.266 --> 33:30.443
-Why would I hurt her?
-Because she was close
to learning the truth.

33:30.486 --> 33:31.574
No.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.663
No, you got it wrong.

33:35.404 --> 33:38.016
You know, call me crazy,

33:38.059 --> 33:40.018
but I believe him.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.759
So do I.

33:45.588 --> 33:46.894
What are you doing?

33:46.937 --> 33:50.158
Going on a hunch.

33:50.202 --> 33:52.726
I loved my sister.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.989
I wouldn't do that.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.600
I-I couldn't.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.701
What are you doing?
I'm right in the middle of...

34:11.745 --> 34:13.051
I think I know
who killed Crystal.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.095
Good.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.662
'Cause I don't think
it was Gabe.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.098
-Clearly, you don't, either.
-No.

34:17.142 --> 34:21.189
But a 50% DNA match
can also be to a parent.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.104
Raymond, Crystal's father.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.628
His phone pinged
on Makena Street in Kaneohe

34:25.672 --> 34:27.935
close to one of the Haiku Stairs
access points

34:27.978 --> 34:29.458
this morning.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.809
Her own father.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.604
I didn't mean for it to happen.

34:45.344 --> 34:46.954
My son...

34:46.997 --> 34:50.262
His temper
gets the best of him sometimes.

34:51.045 --> 34:52.481
So you murdered your
daughter to protect him?

34:52.525 --> 34:54.483
I didn't...

34:58.835 --> 35:01.011
I didn't murder her.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.233
I knew about Raina.

35:05.277 --> 35:06.800
Gabe had told me.

35:06.843 --> 35:09.150
And I knew Crystal was getting
close to figuring it out,

35:09.194 --> 35:10.934
so I went on the hike.

35:12.980 --> 35:15.287
Try and get her
to stop investigating.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.898
<i>I told her the truth.</i>

35:17.941 --> 35:20.422
-Crystal, please.
-Why are you protecting him?

35:20.466 --> 35:23.904
Because he's my son.
-He's your brother!
-He killed Raina, Dad.

35:23.947 --> 35:27.081
Throwing his life away
isn't gonna bring her back.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.213
Crystal.

35:28.256 --> 35:29.344
I grabbed her by the arm.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.998
-Please, listen to me.
-No!

35:31.041 --> 35:32.913
I just wanted to keep talking.

35:32.956 --> 35:35.045
-Crystal.
-No, you're not gonna stop me!

35:35.089 --> 35:37.047
She lost her balance.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.928
I'm sorry.

35:50.409 --> 35:54.848
I'm-I'm so sorry.

36:13.736 --> 36:14.955
Ah.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.131
Look, pal, I...Before I overstep...

36:20.308 --> 36:22.092
I'm sorry, man.

36:22.136 --> 36:25.400
Yeah, me, too.
You were just trying to help.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.752
I-I thought
that you needed to hear

36:29.796 --> 36:31.711
-that you could do it.
-Yeah, well,

36:31.754 --> 36:33.278
you weren't totally wrong.

36:33.321 --> 36:35.410
But there's more to it.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.107
Every day, I got to deal

36:37.151 --> 36:39.980
with some asshat I don't
even know asking me

36:40.023 --> 36:42.069
the most personal questions.

36:42.112 --> 36:44.245
You know, "How'd you wind up
in the chair?

36:44.289 --> 36:47.205
What happened?
What parts of you still work?"

36:48.031 --> 36:49.729
Ah, man, it must be exhausting

36:49.772 --> 36:51.557
dealing with
other people's ignorance.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.906
It sucks.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.908
Asking for more of it
in my work life

36:54.951 --> 36:56.866
just didn't seem worth it.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.001
But it's not just that.

37:01.044 --> 37:03.786
The-the thing is, as a pilot,

37:03.830 --> 37:07.007
I'd be responsible
for passengers...

37:07.050 --> 37:08.356
again.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.011
You're talking
-about your last convoy.
-Yeah.

37:13.143 --> 37:14.928
Hitting that IED,

37:14.971 --> 37:17.017
I made one stupid mistake,

37:17.060 --> 37:18.932
and it cost my friends
their lives.

37:18.975 --> 37:21.064
I'm-- It's my fault
they're gone.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.807
And I-I've made peace with that.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.289
Much as I can.

37:31.684 --> 37:32.989
Man,

37:33.033 --> 37:34.513
when TC offered me
the chance to pilot,

37:34.556 --> 37:35.818
I got sick.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.342
I-I just...

37:37.385 --> 37:40.693
couldn't imagine being
responsible for lives again.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.043
I'm sorry, Sham.

37:43.086 --> 37:44.784
I'm sorry you got to deal
with that, man.

37:44.827 --> 37:47.308
No, don't be.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.704
'Cause the more I thought
about it,

37:51.747 --> 37:54.054
the more I realized
you're right.

37:54.097 --> 37:56.361
I <i>can</i> do the job.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.145
I may even want to do it.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.582
So you're gonna accept it?

38:00.626 --> 38:02.671
No.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.196
Not right now.

38:07.023 --> 38:09.069
But I'm thinking about it.

38:10.157 --> 38:12.725
Why don't you think about it
over a couple of beers.

38:12.768 --> 38:16.076
Yeah. Yeah.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.818
Thanks, brother.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.953
Cheers, pal.

38:38.228 --> 38:39.926
Hey.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.754
Where you going?

38:42.537 --> 38:45.497
I thought you might need
some space after today.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.368
I'm-a go get a hotel.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.501
Oh, come on, I...

38:49.544 --> 38:51.894
can't let you do that.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.376
It's funny.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.987
I didn't tell you
about me and your mother

38:58.031 --> 38:59.946
because I didn't want
to hurt you,

38:59.989 --> 39:02.688
but it feels
like what hurt you the most

39:02.731 --> 39:04.994
is not telling you.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.258
I'm sorry.

39:09.782 --> 39:13.002
I'm sorry. No, I, uh...

39:13.046 --> 39:15.048
I was caught off guard.

39:15.091 --> 39:18.399
I wish you had
told me, but, um...

39:18.443 --> 39:20.358
I think what hurt

39:20.401 --> 39:21.881
was just...

39:23.186 --> 39:25.275
...being reminded
that I wasn't there

39:25.319 --> 39:27.495
when my mom needed me the most.

39:28.322 --> 39:31.412
The way I reacted
wasn't fair.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.283
You're a good kid.

39:33.327 --> 39:34.981
Still protecting your father.

39:35.024 --> 39:36.722
You've always had a big heart.

39:36.765 --> 39:39.551
Yeah, well, you taught me well.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.161
Your mother taught you well.

39:41.204 --> 39:44.773
That's what drew me to her,
that heart of hers.

39:46.079 --> 39:49.343
She was the love of my life,
Thomas.

39:49.387 --> 39:53.739
And I suspect I was,
for her, a way to keep

39:53.782 --> 39:55.088
your father alive.

39:55.131 --> 39:58.308
He was the love of <i>her</i> life.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.051
Yeah.

40:07.013 --> 40:09.102
Ethan,
I know you're home by now.

40:09.145 --> 40:11.931
Please, just talk to me.

40:14.194 --> 40:15.804
Ethan!

40:18.111 --> 40:19.808
-Juliet.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.641
What are you doing here?

40:26.685 --> 40:27.947
You've been ignoring

40:27.990 --> 40:30.079
my calls and texts all day.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.344
I needed time to think.

40:51.492 --> 40:54.234
Look...

40:54.277 --> 40:59.021
I wish that my story
was different.

40:59.805 --> 41:02.590
It's not about your past.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.464
I just can't help but wonder

41:06.507 --> 41:08.553
if there's anything else
you're not telling me.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.119
I've been truthful

41:10.163 --> 41:12.861
about everything
that matters most.

41:14.863 --> 41:16.561
I have

41:16.604 --> 41:18.214
shown who I am to you

41:18.258 --> 41:21.479
in a way that I didn't think
was possible after Richard.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.178
Okay?

41:26.962 --> 41:30.488
My feelings for you
are very real.

41:32.228 --> 41:34.883
I love you, Ethan.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.975
I love you, too.

41:41.847 --> 41:44.197
But right now,

41:44.240 --> 41:46.939
when I look at you...

41:48.897 --> 41:51.421
It's not the same.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.904
I don't know
if I can trust you.

41:58.603 --> 42:01.519
And I'm gonna have
to figure that out.

42:05.479 --> 42:09.178
I might be going
out of the country for a while.

42:09.222 --> 42:11.137
Doctors Without Borders

42:11.180 --> 42:13.705
want me in the field again.

42:13.748 --> 42:16.272
They need surgeons in Kenya.

42:17.578 --> 42:20.450
I'll be gone
at least six months.

42:22.801 --> 42:25.760
Maybe we could, uh,

42:25.804 --> 42:28.371
use some time apart.

42:35.117 --> 42:37.380
It's not what I want.

42:41.341 --> 42:44.083
But, um,

42:44.126 --> 42:47.129
I understand
if that's what you need.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.137
It's what I need.
