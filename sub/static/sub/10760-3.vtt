Yes, thank you, Roz. But l am not

a little encouragement into this box--

00:39.705 --> 00:41.162
- Come on.
- l'm paying my fare.

Well, would you rather wind up
on the floor?

- Thank you. How are you doing?

01:06.876 --> 01:11.831
- Which one are you staring at?
- l'm not staring. That would be rude.

01:12.043 --> 01:14.580
- Which one?
- The blonde.

Why don't you go and talk to her?

01:16.378 --> 01:18.701
Please, Roz, come on.
The woman's a perfect stranger.

lt's not like you'll ever see her again
if she shoots you down.

01:50.426 --> 01:52.665
Well, perhaps you're right.

01:52.843 --> 01:54.917
What harm could it do?

01:55.135 --> 01:59.129

All right, no more weather talk.

a little stir crazy

we had a few years ago?

Oh, please, don't remind me.

sharing that moment with you.

this Saturday?

Except we'll be together.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.780

'92 Dom PÃ©rignon, we'll serve the '90

05:21.296 --> 05:24.081
l went six months without replacing
my pollen filter in my car,

05:24.255 --> 05:26.128
so it was in the shop.

05:26.297 --> 05:29.379
Couldn't get a cab,
so l took the bus home.

05:29.548 --> 05:31.124
Which splashed me.

05:31.340 --> 05:33.710
And l fell down, missed my stop,

05:33.882 --> 05:37.295
and had to walk home ten blocks
in this downpour.

05:37.508 --> 05:41.549
You went six months
without changing your pollen filter?

05:43.675 --> 05:45.999

- Desperately.

to spend one night with me?

l spend every night with you. l have
done my best to keep you entertained,

since you've landed at my doorstep,

to show any interest in basketball?

young woman on the bus.

Just when l had worked up
enough nerve to go and talk to her,

07:00.856 --> 07:06.356
l slipped on something
that l can only hope was an old burrito.

07:14.108 --> 07:16.597
Before l could manage to get up,
she was gone.

it just wasn't meant to be.

Seize the day.

with Daphne by just sitting around?

- Take a chapter from my book.
- Mm-hm.

07:36.113 --> 07:38.483
Exactly what chapter
would that be, Niles?

07:38.655 --> 07:40.859
- The last chapter.
- Yeah.

07:41.238 --> 07:44.153
Suppose l did go and talk with her.
What would l say?

to have dinner sometime?''

and mail it to her.

No, just pretend
you're there on business.

on the way.

that l go crawling back to Dad,

to the game,

08:22.037 --> 08:23.696

the sequence right.

08:31.247 --> 08:33.452

You could have told me
we were stopping here when we left.

You never would have
agreed to come.

08:40.539 --> 08:43.491
