00:00.442 --> 00:02.944
Narrator: <i>In December of 2010,</i>
<i>my friends and I decided</i>

00:02.945 --> 00:05.513
to go see It's a Wonderful Life
<i>on the big screen.</i>

00:05.514 --> 00:07.348
<i>It seemed like</i>
<i>something we all needed.</i>

00:07.349 --> 00:09.918
<i>After all, it had been</i>
<i>a crazy couple of days.</i>

00:09.919 --> 00:11.419
<i>It all started...</i>

00:11.420 --> 00:13.788
<i>With a pregnancy test.</i>

00:13.789 --> 00:16.090
This is taking forever.
Are you sure you did it right?

00:16.091 --> 00:18.726
Is there a wrong way
to pee on a stick?

00:18.727 --> 00:22.563
Hey, can I ask you a question
that's plagued me for years?

00:22.564 --> 00:23.831
Can girls aim?

00:23.832 --> 00:25.333
Um, can boys aim?

00:25.334 --> 00:27.669
'Cause it seems to me
like I'm taking a mop

00:27.670 --> 00:29.170
to that bathroom floor
every two days.

00:29.171 --> 00:31.272
Okay, you're the one who
put the <i>Far Side</i> calendar

00:31.273 --> 00:32.573
up over the toilet.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.609
You know I laugh
with my whole body.

00:34.610 --> 00:37.278
(Gasps)
It's been two minutes.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.315
(Both exhale)

00:40.316 --> 00:43.618
Both:
One, two, three.

00:44.853 --> 00:47.322
It's positive. It's positive?
It's positive?

00:47.323 --> 00:48.356
It's positive.
It's positive?

00:48.357 --> 00:49.357
It's positive!

00:49.358 --> 00:50.558
It's positive!

00:50.559 --> 00:52.026
Whoa!
(Screaming)

00:52.027 --> 00:53.261
Whoa!

00:53.262 --> 00:54.963
I'm pregnant.

00:54.964 --> 00:56.130
What?!

00:56.131 --> 00:57.899
I've never seen that
woman before in my life!

00:57.900 --> 01:00.301
Sorry. Force of habit.
Congratulations!

01:01.470 --> 01:03.071
To Lily and Marshall.

01:03.072 --> 01:04.305
To Lily and Marshall.

01:04.306 --> 01:05.406
Well, thank you.

01:05.407 --> 01:07.475
I mean, we've never been happier.
Mm.

01:07.476 --> 01:10.111
Can't imagine anything
bringing me down right now.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.279
You're not pregnant.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.515
Well, that did it.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.715
Narrator: <i>Kids, this is the</i>
<i>story of the 36 hours</i>

01:30.716 --> 01:32.917
<i>we all thought</i>
<i>Lily was pregnant,</i>

01:32.918 --> 01:35.586
<i>and how it caused each of us</i>
<i>to reexamine our own lives.</i>

01:35.587 --> 01:36.854
<i>Because while</i>
<i>this was happening...</i>

01:36.855 --> 01:38.322
Are you sure you did it right?

01:38.323 --> 01:39.690
<i>...I was on the phone</i>
<i>with Punchy,</i>

01:39.691 --> 01:41.025
<i>my best friend</i>
<i>from high school,</i>

01:41.026 --> 01:43.327
<i>who had recently asked me</i>
<i>to be his best man.</i>

01:43.328 --> 01:44.929
Hey, Punchy, I've given this
some serious thought.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.797
I think I know
how we can crush these

01:46.798 --> 01:47.898
floral arrangements.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.001
Ah, here it comes.
Hit me up, Schmos!

01:50.002 --> 01:54.305
Peonies, lavender blossoms
with a halo of baby's breath

01:54.306 --> 01:56.374
for an ambiance
of springtime rejuvenation.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.109
(High-pitched):
¶ Crushed it! ¶

01:58.110 --> 01:59.777
That's exactly
the accent of whimsy

01:59.778 --> 02:01.579
this celebration of love needs!

02:01.580 --> 02:03.814
It's gonna be a magical day.

02:03.815 --> 02:05.950
I know what you're thinking.

02:05.951 --> 02:08.119
I wish I was a dude.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.086
I do wish you were a dude.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.591
Because if I was a dude, I could
have Ted Mosby as my best man.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.092
No, and here's why.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.361
Ted, the best man's job

02:17.362 --> 02:20.498
is not to crush
the floral arrangements.

02:20.499 --> 02:22.033
It's to get the groom
down the aisle,

02:22.034 --> 02:25.036
because, no matter who
he is, he will freak out.

02:25.037 --> 02:27.371
And I just don't think
you have what it takes

02:27.372 --> 02:29.340
to get that get that soldier
to pick up his rifle

02:29.341 --> 02:30.541
and charge up the hill.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.610
Uh, are you forgetting
I've done this before?

02:32.611 --> 02:33.944
I was Marshall's best man.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.546
And how did that go again?

02:35.547 --> 02:38.649
(Both yelling)

02:38.650 --> 02:40.384
Oh for one.

02:40.385 --> 02:42.153
Oh, come on.
That wasn't my fault.

02:42.154 --> 02:44.789
And need I remind you,
I gave a beautiful toast.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.890
Ted.

02:45.891 --> 02:47.525
(Both yelling)

02:47.526 --> 02:50.828
Oh, do you take one
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

02:51.496 --> 02:53.164
Oh, God, I'm freaking out.

02:53.165 --> 02:55.700
Why did I chose Ted
to be my best man?

02:55.701 --> 02:57.501
Uh, yeah. It's hard
to take criticism

02:57.502 --> 02:59.503
from someone who just recorded
seven episodes

02:59.504 --> 03:01.439
of <i>Million Dollar Heads</i>
<i>or Tails.</i>

03:01.440 --> 03:03.641
Narrator: <i>Kids,</i> 
Million Dollar Heads or Tails

03:03.642 --> 03:05.109
<i>was an extremely popular show</i>

03:05.110 --> 03:07.044
<i>with an extremely</i>
<i>simple premise.</i>

03:07.045 --> 03:09.046
All right,
your practice flip came up

03:09.047 --> 03:10.047
tails...

03:10.048 --> 03:11.849
But our Vegas oddsmaker
tells us

03:11.850 --> 03:14.952
that the next toss
is still just 50-50.

03:14.953 --> 03:16.420
And so, Jordan,

03:16.421 --> 03:18.422
for one million dollars...

03:19.224 --> 03:22.059
...Heads... or tails?

03:22.060 --> 03:24.161
(Audience shouting suggestions)

03:24.162 --> 03:27.665
What was the year
of the coin again?

03:27.666 --> 03:29.333
Why this sudden obsession
with <i>Heads or Tails?</i>

03:29.334 --> 03:31.102
Well, it turns out

03:31.103 --> 03:34.372
that <i>Heads or Tails</i>
has a job opening.

03:34.373 --> 03:35.339
(Audience shouting suggestions)

03:35.340 --> 03:36.640
Ta... heads.

03:36.641 --> 03:39.176
Marni, flip that coin.

03:39.878 --> 03:41.045
Ooh! Damn!

03:41.046 --> 03:42.046
(Audience groaning)

03:42.047 --> 03:43.447
So now, because
of that incident,

03:43.448 --> 03:44.915
<i>Heads or Tails</i> is looking

03:44.916 --> 03:47.385
for a new
currency rotation specialist.

03:47.386 --> 03:48.886
You mean coin flip bimbo?

03:48.887 --> 03:50.588
They're not bimbos!

03:50.589 --> 03:53.557
You auditioned, didn't you?

03:58.029 --> 03:59.430
And you're Canadian?!

03:59.431 --> 04:00.765
Mm.

04:00.766 --> 04:02.400
Robin, aside from that coin,

04:02.401 --> 04:04.969
this is the other thing
that's flipping right now.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.570
What is my lid?

04:06.571 --> 04:08.639
For you.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.474
You're the new coin flip bimbo?

04:10.475 --> 04:12.309
Currency rotation specialist.

04:12.310 --> 04:14.545
Robin, you better check yourself

04:14.546 --> 04:16.747
before you trebek yourself.

04:16.748 --> 04:17.947
You're a journalist!

04:17.949 --> 04:19.750
What is the matter with you?

04:19.750 --> 04:21.152
Well, it's a national audience!

04:21.153 --> 04:22.753
I get to wear shiny dresses!

04:22.754 --> 04:24.021
Robin,

04:24.022 --> 04:26.457
have you forgotten about
your New Year's resolution?

04:26.458 --> 04:30.361
I am never drinking again.

04:30.362 --> 04:31.662
No, before that.

04:31.663 --> 04:36.066
(Slurring): I am gonna finish
this whole bottle tonight.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.468
Before that, too.

04:37.469 --> 04:38.836
I moved here

04:38.837 --> 04:40.938
to work for a big-time
cable news channel

04:40.939 --> 04:42.239
like World Wide News.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.641
Mm-hmm.
Well,

04:43.642 --> 04:46.010
by this time next year,
I will be wearing

04:46.011 --> 04:48.913
a World Wide News
I.D. badge around my neck.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.915
And to show you
that I'm serious,

04:50.916 --> 04:53.217
this is my first and
only drink of the night.

04:53.218 --> 04:55.486
Okay.
Okay?

04:56.388 --> 04:59.256
Oh, damn, that's smooth.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.859
I thought you finally got that
interview at World Wide News.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.795
Well, I did, but they only
offered me a boring,

05:04.796 --> 05:07.298
low-paid,
off-camera research job.

05:07.299 --> 05:09.600
Which could be a stepping stone
to bigger things in your career.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.269
Well, so could <i>Heads or Tails.</i> 
(Snorts)

05:12.270 --> 05:14.171
The first currency
rotation specialist went on

05:14.172 --> 05:17.708
to be a semi-finalist
on <i>The Bachelor,</i> and then,

05:17.709 --> 05:20.511
she lost, like, a hundred pounds
on <i>The Biggest Loser,</i>

05:20.512 --> 05:22.980
and now she's totally winning
<i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

05:22.981 --> 05:26.083
Narrator: <i>It seemed like there was</i>
<i>no changing Robin's mind.</i>

05:26.084 --> 05:28.185
<i>But what we didn't know,</i>
<i>in that moment,</i>

05:28.186 --> 05:31.121
<i>was that our world was about</i>
<i>to be turned upside down.</i>

05:31.122 --> 05:32.957
I'm pregnant.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.191
What?!

05:34.192 --> 05:35.993
<i>Now, kids, when your friends</i>
<i>have great news,</i>

05:35.994 --> 05:38.162
<i>you're happy for them...</i>
<i>For, like, a millisecond.</i>

05:38.163 --> 05:40.498
<i>And then you start thinking</i>
<i>about yourself.</i>

05:40.499 --> 05:41.932
Robin:
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

05:41.933 --> 05:44.301
<i>They're really having a baby.</i>

05:44.302 --> 05:46.103
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

05:46.104 --> 05:48.305
<i>Starting Monday,</i>
<i>I'm a currency rotation spe...</i>

05:48.306 --> 05:49.673
<i>Oh, who am I kidding?</i>

05:49.674 --> 05:52.076
<i>I'm a coin flip bimbo,</i>
and <i>I'm still single.</i>

05:52.077 --> 05:53.744
<i>Okay, let's not go there,</i>
<i>Scherbatsky.</i>

05:53.745 --> 05:55.012
<i>That's a whole other thing.</i>

05:55.013 --> 05:57.615
<i>I've got to take</i>
<i>that World Wide News job.</i>

05:57.616 --> 06:00.951
Narrator: And so, the next night, we
had <i>two things to celebrate.</i>

06:00.952 --> 06:03.420
Well, you are looking at the new

06:03.421 --> 06:06.023
associate researcher
at World Wide News.

06:06.024 --> 06:07.992
(Gasps) Oh, my gosh.
That's amazing news.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.660
What changed your mind?

06:09.661 --> 06:10.928
Marshall and Lily.

06:10.929 --> 06:12.196
I just realized that

06:12.197 --> 06:14.798
I am about to have a little
niece who looks up to me.

06:14.799 --> 06:16.901
And I don't want to be
sad aunt Robin,

06:16.902 --> 06:19.436
the aging coin flip bimbo
who gives her the creeps.

06:19.437 --> 06:22.540
I want to be cool aunt Robin,
the respected journalist...

06:22.541 --> 06:23.774
(Quietly):
Who gives her beer.

06:23.775 --> 06:26.343
What?
What? Oh.

06:27.279 --> 06:30.014
I have never seen you guys
looking so at peace.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.048
(Both sigh)

06:31.049 --> 06:32.049
To Lily and Marshall.

06:32.050 --> 06:33.284
To Lily and Marshall.

06:33.285 --> 06:34.418
Well, thank you.

06:34.419 --> 06:36.520
I mean, we've never
been happier.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.489
Narrator:
<i>So the next day Robin called</i>

06:38.490 --> 06:40.357
Heads or Tails
<i>to respectfully decline.</i>

06:40.358 --> 06:43.027
Hi, Mr. Trebek.
This is Robin Scherbatsky.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.562
Narrator:
<i>But at that moment...</i>

06:44.563 --> 06:45.696
You're not pregnant.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.964
(Both gasp)

06:46.965 --> 06:49.266
As honored as I am
by the offer, um...

06:49.267 --> 06:51.101
(Phone chirps)

06:51.102 --> 06:53.037
Robin:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

06:53.038 --> 06:54.972
<i>They're not having a baby.</i>

06:54.973 --> 06:57.808
<i>What am I getting</i>
<i>all up in</i> my <i>head about?</i>

06:57.809 --> 06:59.877
That research job sounds hard.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.478
<i>And I'm pretty.</i>

07:01.479 --> 07:05.716
<i>I'm really, really pretty.</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:08.652
You are looking

07:08.653 --> 07:10.654
at the new coin flip bimbo.

07:10.655 --> 07:14.992
(Imitates fireworks popping)

07:18.255 --> 07:19.689
You took the heads or tails job?
Yeah.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.995
What about World Wide News,
your I.D. badge?

07:22.996 --> 07:25.097
You made a New Year's
resolution.

07:25.098 --> 07:28.300
Okay, I also said I would never
make out with a garbage man.

07:28.301 --> 07:31.036
Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans.

07:31.037 --> 07:33.405
What's with
the gingerbread house?

07:33.406 --> 07:34.773
We're seeing a Christmas movie.

07:34.774 --> 07:37.843
It's a Christmas-themed
movie snack.

07:37.844 --> 07:40.245
Let's hope Santa brings you
a girlfriend this year, Teddy.

07:40.246 --> 07:41.880
(Mutters mockingly)

07:41.881 --> 07:43.282
Where the hell is Barney?

07:43.283 --> 07:44.516
Narrator:
<i>Where was Barney?</i>

07:44.517 --> 07:45.918
<i>Let's back up again.</i>

07:45.919 --> 07:47.753
<i>You see,</i>
<i>while this was going on...</i>

07:47.754 --> 07:49.221
It's positive.
It's positive?!

07:49.222 --> 07:50.389
<i>...This was happening.</i>

07:50.390 --> 07:53.492
And now she's totally winning
<i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

07:54.160 --> 07:55.861
Hey, guys.

07:55.862 --> 07:57.863
A yuletide riddle.

07:57.864 --> 08:02.001
What is my second favorite word
that begins with b-o-n?

08:02.002 --> 08:03.102
Bon Jovi?

08:03.103 --> 08:04.470
Yeah.

08:04.471 --> 08:07.506
What is my third favorite word
that begins with b-o-n?

08:07.507 --> 08:09.174
(Imitates buzzer)
Bonus.

08:09.175 --> 08:12.344
As in, my end-of-the-year
bonus check.

08:12.345 --> 08:13.646
(Laughing)

08:13.647 --> 08:15.214
My God, Barney!

08:15.215 --> 08:17.116
I work for GNB, too.

08:17.117 --> 08:19.885
All I got was $15 gift card
to Costa Coffee.

08:19.886 --> 08:21.153
And you earned it, buddy.

08:21.154 --> 08:24.023
Check out what I'm
gonna buy for myself.

08:24.024 --> 08:26.725
The dibiase.

08:26.726 --> 08:28.127
See those pinstripes?

08:28.128 --> 08:30.062
Diamonds.

08:30.063 --> 08:33.399
It is the uppest
a person could ever suit.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.568
Uh, has it ever occurred to you
to give some of this to charity?

08:36.568 --> 08:39.471
Charity? You're seriously
talking to me about charity?

08:39.472 --> 08:41.106
Dude, I am Mr. Charity.

08:41.107 --> 08:45.177
I frequently sleep with sixes,

08:45.178 --> 08:48.514
chubsters, over-thirties...

08:48.515 --> 08:52.451
I am the bill and Melinda gates
of the sympathy bang.

08:53.253 --> 08:54.353
Hey, guys.

08:54.354 --> 08:55.621
Hi.
Hey.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.622
Big announcement.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.790
Let me guess.

08:57.791 --> 08:59.158
You got a huge bonus check, too.

08:59.159 --> 09:01.193
No, just a $30 gift card
to Costa Coffee.

09:01.194 --> 09:02.227
Thirty?!

09:02.228 --> 09:04.029
I'm pregnant.
What?!

09:04.030 --> 09:06.699
What?! I've never seen that
woman before in my life!

09:06.700 --> 09:08.367
Sorry, force of habit.

09:08.368 --> 09:09.768
Congratulations!

09:10.637 --> 09:12.571
<i>Huh. Marshall and Lily are</i>

09:12.572 --> 09:13.972
<i>doing something meaningful.</i>

09:13.973 --> 09:16.742
<i>And it's making me</i>
<i>less happy about this bonus.</i>

09:16.743 --> 09:18.644
<i>And I'm still single.</i>

09:18.645 --> 09:20.446
<i>At least I got</i>
<i>that going for me.</i>

09:20.447 --> 09:23.649
So why do I still feel outside
<i>of awesome looking in?</i>

09:23.650 --> 09:26.752
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

09:26.753 --> 09:29.121
We've never been happier.

09:29.122 --> 09:31.390
I can't imagine bringing
me down right now.

09:31.391 --> 09:34.259
Oh, Marshall, you only think
you're happy.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.728
Just wait, because tonight,

09:35.729 --> 09:38.997
(imitating Oprah):
is Barney's Favorite Things!

09:38.998 --> 09:41.700
(All cheering)

09:45.772 --> 09:48.974
<i>That was the reaction</i>
<i>Barney expected.</i>

09:48.975 --> 09:51.310
<i>This was the one he got.</i>

09:51.311 --> 09:53.545
Huh?
I don't know what that is.

09:53.546 --> 09:55.681
Barney's Favorite Things!

09:55.682 --> 10:00.185
I'm gonna give you all a bunch
of free stuff... like Oprah.

10:00.186 --> 10:01.520
Just get excited, okay?

10:01.521 --> 10:03.589
The next hour got pretty weird.

10:03.590 --> 10:06.892
Velour track suits!

10:06.893 --> 10:08.727
Velour is so comfortable.
They're so soft.

10:08.728 --> 10:11.497
Remote control helicopters!

10:11.498 --> 10:13.432
(All cheer)

10:14.334 --> 10:15.801
Condoms!

10:18.671 --> 10:20.472
And last but not least...

10:20.473 --> 10:23.509
There is
a fleet of limos outside

10:23.510 --> 10:26.645
waiting to take us to...

10:26.646 --> 10:28.547
A strip club!

10:28.548 --> 10:31.884
(Applause, cheering)

10:31.885 --> 10:34.787
You get a lap dance!
You get a lap dance!

10:34.788 --> 10:36.655
You're gonna give me
a lap dance!

10:36.656 --> 10:40.192
Everybody gets a lap dance!

10:41.861 --> 10:43.262
That was amazing!

10:43.263 --> 10:45.397
It was like a diamond suit
for my soul.

10:45.398 --> 10:47.332
I gotta keep going.
I gotta do more.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.568
No. No! I cannot go back
to that strip club.

10:49.569 --> 10:52.171
I seen some things.

10:52.172 --> 10:54.039
I'm not going back either.

10:54.040 --> 10:58.243
I'm taking the rest of my bonus
to God's strip club.

10:58.244 --> 11:00.012
Narrator:
<i>The next day, he paid a visit</i>

11:00.013 --> 11:01.480
<i>to the most</i>
<i>charitable man he knew,</i>

11:01.481 --> 11:03.248
<i>his half-brother's father,</i>
<i>Sam Gibbs,</i>

11:03.249 --> 11:05.384
<i>a minister at a church</i>
<i>out on Long Island.</i>

11:05.385 --> 11:06.785
Sam.

11:06.786 --> 11:07.886
Uh, father.

11:07.887 --> 11:09.688
I-I don't mean father father.

11:09.689 --> 11:11.023
Unless...

11:11.024 --> 11:12.057
What's up, Barney?

11:12.058 --> 11:13.759
I'm thinking about

11:13.760 --> 11:15.627
giving some money to charity.

11:15.628 --> 11:18.096
Is that the name of the stripper
you've been e-mailing me about?

11:18.097 --> 11:20.199
You got to take me off
that list, Barney.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.202
No, I don't mean that charity.

11:23.203 --> 11:24.803
That charity is doing peachy.

11:24.804 --> 11:27.606
You'll see pics of the two of
them in next week's e-mail.

11:27.607 --> 11:28.941
What up!
Barney,

11:28.942 --> 11:30.742
I'm a minister.

11:30.743 --> 11:32.778
Unsubscribe.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.214
I-I recently
started giving,

11:35.215 --> 11:36.882
and it felt surprisingly good.

11:36.883 --> 11:38.383
I want to do more.

11:38.384 --> 11:39.551
Well, now you're talking.

11:39.552 --> 11:41.820
We have this program
that helps those in need

11:41.821 --> 11:43.088
get back on their feet.

11:43.089 --> 11:45.757
We give them food,
a place to live,

11:45.758 --> 11:47.526
clothes for job interviews.

11:47.527 --> 11:51.930
Well, I would love to help
by writing a check

11:51.931 --> 11:57.436
for... one, zero, zero, zero...

11:57.437 --> 11:58.403
You're not pregnant.

11:58.404 --> 11:59.404
(Both gasp)

11:59.405 --> 12:00.405
...Zero...

12:00.406 --> 12:01.473
(Cell phone chimes)

12:01.474 --> 12:04.009
Woops. Hold on a second.

12:05.945 --> 12:07.713
<i>Wait. They're</i>
<i>not doing</i>

12:07.714 --> 12:09.414
<i>something meaningful</i>
<i>with their lives.</i>

12:09.415 --> 12:11.583
Well, this changes everything.

12:11.584 --> 12:14.586
<i>Oh, no, I've already</i>
<i>written four zeroes.</i>

12:14.587 --> 12:15.520
(Gasps)

12:15.521 --> 12:18.690
<i>Thank you, decimal point.</i>

12:18.691 --> 12:22.294
One hundred dollars.

12:22.295 --> 12:25.330
That's great!

12:25.331 --> 12:26.865
Thank you, Barney!

12:29.969 --> 12:33.605
Diamond suited up.

12:34.507 --> 12:36.141
Hey, Ted, can you
spot me for the movie?

12:36.142 --> 12:38.477
I don't like to carry
a lot of cash on me.

12:43.694 --> 12:45.128
What happened
to giving the money away?

12:45.129 --> 12:46.663
Yeah, that was back when
Lily was pregnant.

12:46.664 --> 12:47.597
Now she's not.

12:47.598 --> 12:50.467
Ergo, a suit is born.
(Chuckles)

12:51.068 --> 12:52.168
Dude, what's up with

12:52.169 --> 12:53.903
the gingerbread house?
You look ridiculous!

12:53.904 --> 12:55.972
It's a Christmas-themed
movie snack!

12:55.973 --> 12:58.375
Ah, I know that move.

12:58.376 --> 12:59.943
You cut a hole in the floor,

12:59.944 --> 13:02.512
she reaches into the
living room, finds the tree...

13:02.513 --> 13:04.814
¶ O holy night. ¶

13:04.815 --> 13:06.082
Nice.

13:06.584 --> 13:07.584
Where the hell

13:07.585 --> 13:09.119
are Marshall and Lily?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.954
Narrator:
<i>Let's back up one last time.</i>

13:10.955 --> 13:12.222
I'm pregnant.

13:12.223 --> 13:13.857
What?!
What?!

13:13.858 --> 13:15.792
I've never seen that
woman before in my life!

13:15.793 --> 13:16.893
Sorry, force of habit.

13:16.894 --> 13:18.828
Congratulations!

13:18.829 --> 13:20.163
<i>This is great.</i>

13:20.164 --> 13:21.564
<i>I'm happy.</i>

13:21.565 --> 13:23.500
<i>I'm so happy,</i>
<i>my heart's pounding.</i>

13:23.501 --> 13:24.968
<i>And I'm sweating.</i>

13:24.969 --> 13:26.569
<i>And I can't breathe.</i>

13:26.570 --> 13:28.405
<i>This is what happiness</i>
<i>feels like, right?</i>

13:28.406 --> 13:29.906
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

13:29.907 --> 13:31.875
<i>Lily's having a baby</i>
<i>and I'm having a panic attack.</i>

13:31.876 --> 13:33.977
<i>I hope she can't tell</i>
<i>what I'm thinking right now.</i>

13:33.978 --> 13:35.311
<i>I can.</i>

13:35.312 --> 13:36.679
<i>And I'm freaking out, too!</i>

13:36.680 --> 13:38.314
<i>There's an alien</i>
<i>growing in my stomach</i>

13:38.315 --> 13:40.383
<i>that's gonna explode</i>
<i>out of my vagina!</i>

13:40.384 --> 13:42.252
<i>Do you think the others</i>
<i>can tell we're freaking out?</i>

13:42.253 --> 13:44.087
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

13:44.088 --> 13:45.688
<i>What am I doing</i>
<i>with my life?</i>

13:45.689 --> 13:48.992
I should get a Christmas-themed
<i>movie snack for tomorrow night.</i>

13:48.993 --> 13:50.126
<i>They're totally onto us.</i>

13:50.127 --> 13:51.261
<i>What do we do?</i>

13:51.262 --> 13:52.862
Just keep smiling, maybe wave.

13:52.863 --> 13:53.963
<i>No, don't wave!</i>

13:53.964 --> 13:54.964
<i>That makes no sense!</i>

13:54.965 --> 13:56.166
<i>I'm committed.</i>

13:56.167 --> 13:57.567
<i>I'm riding this wave</i>
<i>straight to hell.</i>

13:57.568 --> 13:59.502
<i>Let's leave, then the waving</i>
<i>will make sense.</i>

13:59.503 --> 14:02.439
Narrator: <i>So Marshall and Lily</i>
<i>headed home.</i>

14:02.440 --> 14:04.441
Marshall:
<i>Lily, we have to relax.</i>

14:04.442 --> 14:05.975
There's no need to panic.

14:05.976 --> 14:07.077
True, there's a lot to do,

14:07.078 --> 14:08.378
but we've got nine months
to prepare.

14:08.379 --> 14:10.780
So I say that we just
make a list of everything

14:10.781 --> 14:12.715
that needs to get done
before the baby arrives

14:12.716 --> 14:14.284
and do everything
on that list tonight!

14:14.285 --> 14:16.319
Let's do it!
(Yelling)

14:16.320 --> 14:17.620
Uh-huh, got it.

14:17.621 --> 14:19.022
Okay, that seems easy.

14:19.023 --> 14:20.890
Nursery's painted!

14:20.891 --> 14:22.525
Blue? What if it's a girl?

14:22.526 --> 14:23.493
Damn it!

Oh, God, it's 8:00!

14:38.342 --> 14:40.243
We're supposed to meet the
gang at the bar to celebrate.

14:40.244 --> 14:41.411
Oh, God. Okay, listen.

14:41.412 --> 14:43.446
When we meet them,
we have to keep it together.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.447
Can you keep it together?!

14:44.448 --> 14:46.049
No, I can't keep it together!

14:46.050 --> 14:49.319
Robin: I have never seen you
guys looking so at peace.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.386
(Both sigh)

14:50.387 --> 14:51.454
To Lily and Marshall.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.856
Lily and Marshall.

14:52.857 --> 14:53.857
Well, thank you.

14:53.858 --> 14:56.726
I mean,
we've never been happier.

14:56.727 --> 14:58.328
(Rock music playing)
This is a nightmare!

14:58.329 --> 15:00.029
We've done everything wrong!

15:00.030 --> 15:01.498
(Screams)

15:01.499 --> 15:03.733
The iPod was on shuffle!

15:03.734 --> 15:04.801
(Rock music stops)

15:04.802 --> 15:05.835
The Jerky Boys!

15:05.836 --> 15:08.004
Our baby heard the Jerky Boys!

15:08.005 --> 15:09.506
You know what,
the Jerky Boys are funny.

15:09.507 --> 15:12.075
The Jerky Boys aren't funny,
they are awful.

15:12.076 --> 15:13.443
You know what, fine,
if you don't think

15:13.444 --> 15:15.044
the Jerky Boys are funny,
then I'm not sure

15:15.045 --> 15:16.813
that I can raise a child
with you, liver lips.

15:16.814 --> 15:18.681
(Gasps)

15:18.682 --> 15:20.250
Marshall, I don't like this.

15:20.251 --> 15:21.384
I know. Okay?

15:21.385 --> 15:23.119
I don't like it either.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.989
It's like I have a hot, burning

15:25.990 --> 15:28.725
ball of stress in my chest,

15:28.726 --> 15:30.560
and nothing
will make it go away!

15:30.561 --> 15:31.728
You're not pregnant.

15:31.729 --> 15:33.563
Well, that did it.

15:33.564 --> 15:36.766
I know this probably comes
as quite a disappointment.

15:38.269 --> 15:39.802
Yeah.

15:39.803 --> 15:41.371
Huge bummer.

15:41.372 --> 15:43.306
So disappointing.

15:45.109 --> 15:46.142
Hey.

15:46.143 --> 15:47.110
Hey.

15:47.111 --> 15:48.044
Are you guys okay?

15:48.045 --> 15:49.245
Huh?
Yeah.

15:49.246 --> 15:51.781
Why wouldn't we be?
Oh, the baby thing.

15:51.782 --> 15:53.249
Oh, yeah, whatever.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.018
Oh, Christmas-themed
movie snack. Nice.

15:55.019 --> 15:57.620
(Chuckles) Don't reach
into the living room!

15:57.621 --> 16:00.390
(Both laugh)

16:00.391 --> 16:02.592
Wow, I-I thought you guys
would be devastated.

16:02.593 --> 16:03.960
Oh.

16:03.961 --> 16:06.362
You know, we're actually
kind of relieved.

16:06.363 --> 16:08.631
We were freaking out for about
a day and a half there.

16:08.632 --> 16:10.900
Yeah, this whole thing
got us thinking.

16:10.901 --> 16:12.902
Maybe we're not ready
for kids yet after all.

16:12.903 --> 16:15.038
Yeah, we were thinking
maybe we would just get a dog.

16:15.039 --> 16:16.105
Get a puppy!

16:16.106 --> 16:17.307
Can you imagine...

16:17.308 --> 16:19.409
That would be the cutest thing!

16:19.410 --> 16:21.144
(Yelling)
No!

16:21.145 --> 16:23.179
Oh. Our movie snack.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.114
Are you kidding me?!

16:25.115 --> 16:27.383
All you ever talk about
is having kids!

16:27.384 --> 16:29.018
And now you have
one little freak-out

16:29.019 --> 16:30.820
and you want to get
a dog instead?!

16:30.821 --> 16:32.355
No. Unacceptable!

16:32.356 --> 16:33.489
You're gonna turn around,

16:33.490 --> 16:35.491
you're gonna go home, get naked,

16:35.492 --> 16:38.294
lie together as man and wife
until Lily is great with child.

16:38.295 --> 16:39.495
Right now!

16:40.197 --> 16:41.764
I'm serious! Go, go, go!

16:44.168 --> 16:46.469
(Singsongy): Marshall and
Lily got in trouble.

16:46.470 --> 16:48.204
And you!
Ooh.

16:48.205 --> 16:50.373
Barney, you look real stupid
in that suit.

16:50.374 --> 16:52.909
You're gonna go get your money
back and give it to charity.

16:52.910 --> 16:55.211
And I don't mean that stripper
you keep e-mailing us about,

16:55.212 --> 16:57.547
even though we beg you
to take us off that list.

16:57.548 --> 17:00.083
I can't give this suit back.

17:00.084 --> 17:01.584
Ted, I glow in the dark.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.553
I finally glow in the dark!

17:03.554 --> 17:06.489
Criminals of New York! Attention!

17:06.490 --> 17:09.224
This man is wearing a
diamond-covered suit!

17:09.226 --> 17:10.226
You could retire

17:10.227 --> 17:11.394
on the pants alone!

17:11.395 --> 17:13.396
Merry Christmas!

17:13.396 --> 17:15.897
(Stuttering)

17:17.667 --> 17:20.203
So, if I get a large popcorn,
you want to go split-skees or...

17:20.204 --> 17:21.537
And you...

17:22.071 --> 17:23.439
You did not move

17:23.440 --> 17:26.442
to the greatest city on earth
to become a coin-flipping bimbo.

17:26.443 --> 17:28.411
So here's how it's gonna work:

17:28.412 --> 17:30.613
Heads, you take the job
at World Wide News;

17:30.614 --> 17:32.682
Tails, you take
the job at World Wide News.

17:32.683 --> 17:34.250
Ow!
(Coin clinks)

17:34.251 --> 17:36.419
Hey, looks like
somebody got a new gig!

17:36.420 --> 17:39.088
Fine, I'll call them tomorrow.

17:39.089 --> 17:41.224
I'll call them right now.
(Annoyed muttering)

17:41.225 --> 17:43.559
(Cell phone ringing)

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
Hello.

17:44.561 --> 17:45.728
Ted, I can't get married!

17:45.729 --> 17:46.829
Yes, you can! You love her!

17:46.830 --> 17:48.431
You're right, I do! Thanks, Ted!

17:56.774 --> 17:59.242
One for <i>It's a Wonderful Life,</i>
please.

18:01.111 --> 18:03.179
Thank you.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.850
Hi.

18:14.158 --> 18:16.459
We're idiots.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.328
This kid doesn't stand a chance.

18:20.731 --> 18:23.499
We're ready for this.
We're ready for this.

18:25.202 --> 18:27.937
Wow.

18:27.938 --> 18:30.039
That's a lot of zeroes.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.108
Y-you sure you're not
missing a decimal point?

18:32.109 --> 18:33.376
Nope.

18:33.377 --> 18:35.144
And that's the tour.

18:35.145 --> 18:37.847
Uh, staff meeting's at noon,
you'll meet everyone there,

18:37.848 --> 18:39.282
but first you need
to head down to security.

18:39.283 --> 18:41.217
You need to get
your picture taken.

18:41.218 --> 18:42.785
For your I.D. badge.

18:42.786 --> 18:45.688
Oh.

18:47.825 --> 18:49.325
You sure?

18:49.326 --> 18:51.494
Positive.

18:54.798 --> 18:55.865
And there's more.

18:55.866 --> 18:57.433
Do you still do that thing
where you give

18:57.434 --> 18:58.801
people in need
clothes for job interviews?

18:58.802 --> 18:59.702
Yeah. Why?

18:59.703 --> 19:02.638
Bring 'em in, boys!

19:08.178 --> 19:10.747
(Chuckles)

19:10.748 --> 19:12.949
Merry Christmas.

19:12.950 --> 19:15.251
Thank you, son.
Son?!

19:15.252 --> 19:17.353
It's just an expression.
I'm still not your dad.

19:26.864 --> 19:28.264
Congratulations.

19:28.265 --> 19:30.666
You know, that was
really cool what you did.

19:31.235 --> 19:32.201
When we all needed it,

19:32.202 --> 19:33.603
you got us back
on the right path.

19:33.604 --> 19:36.506
It's what I do.

19:36.507 --> 19:38.975
Hey, Ted, if I, um,
if I ever get married

19:38.976 --> 19:40.710
and you're not
the guy I'm marrying...

19:40.711 --> 19:42.111
Big mistake, but go on.

19:42.112 --> 19:44.380
...I could really use
someone like you.

19:44.381 --> 19:46.015
You know, in case I freak out.

19:46.016 --> 19:47.750
<i>When</i> I freak out.

19:47.751 --> 19:48.985
You interested?

19:48.986 --> 19:52.255
Are you asking what I
think you're asking?

19:52.256 --> 19:55.425
Ted, will you be my best man?

19:55.426 --> 19:57.960
Scherbatsky...

19:57.961 --> 19:59.695
I'm gonna crush it.

20:09.436 --> 20:10.470
Hi, there.

20:10.471 --> 20:11.771
We've had a lot of fun tonight,

20:11.772 --> 20:14.140
but on a more serious note,
this is the time of year

20:14.141 --> 20:16.309
when we remember
the importance of giving.

20:16.310 --> 20:20.546
And there's no greater gift
than the gift of booty.

20:20.547 --> 20:25.285
So, this holiday season,
why not bang someone in need?

20:25.286 --> 20:27.987
I'm Barney Stinson,
and that's...

20:27.988 --> 20:29.789
One to grow on.

20:29.790 --> 20:30.957
Um, no.

20:32.559 --> 20:36.494
Hi, there. You know, we've
had a lot of fun tonight...

20:37.305 --> 20:43.684
