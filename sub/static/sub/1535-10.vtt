00:03.145 --> 00:06.448
Hello. I'm Dr.
Sheldon Cooper.

00:06.450 --> 00:11.319
And welcome to Sheldon Cooper
Presents: Fun with Flags,

00:11.321 --> 00:13.555
the Final Episode
Flagtacular.

00:13.557 --> 00:15.356
(gasps)

00:15.358 --> 00:18.626
I knew it was coming.
Still scary.

00:18.628 --> 00:21.429
Now, I'm sure you're thinking,
"The final episode?

00:21.431 --> 00:24.833
Who will stand between
us and flag ignorance""

00:24.835 --> 00:27.135
I know I was thinking that.

00:27.137 --> 00:30.772
Is this a show on flags
or mind reading?

00:30.774 --> 00:34.576
But the truth is I can no longer
balance a full-time career,

00:34.578 --> 00:37.345
a popular Internet show,
and a girlfriend.

00:37.347 --> 00:42.183
And he really does have one,
you jerks on the comment board.

00:42.185 --> 00:48.990
So as they say, all good
things must come to an end.

00:48.992 --> 00:51.326
233 if we
include the one

00:51.328 --> 00:54.696
somebody forgot
to press record on.

00:54.698 --> 00:56.664
(quietly): You said
you weren't gonna bring that up.

00:56.666 --> 00:58.346
(quietly): And you
said you pressed record.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.737
Anyway, please
sit back, relax,

01:02.739 --> 01:06.007
and join us as we
take our final lap...

01:07.076 --> 01:10.011
...as indicated by the
waving of this racing flag.

01:10.013 --> 01:12.847
And, of course, white flags
can also represent surrender,

01:12.849 --> 01:15.750
the Stewards of Gondor, and
the Japanese Minamoto clan,

01:15.752 --> 01:18.286
but I'm sure you remember that,
from episode sixty-two.

01:18.288 --> 01:22.657
"White Flags: Who's
Wavin' 'Em and Why?"

01:22.659 --> 01:24.192
That was a good one.

01:24.194 --> 01:25.493
It was so good.

01:56.039 --> 01:59.075
You know, I thought cleaning out
a dead professor's office

01:59.077 --> 02:00.409
was gonna just be boring,

02:00.411 --> 02:02.745
but then I found his dentures

02:02.747 --> 02:05.948
and realized it's also gross.

02:07.617 --> 02:10.752
Doesn't Professor Abbott's
family want any of this stuff?

02:10.755 --> 02:11.854
I don't think he had a family.

02:11.856 --> 02:13.422
That's rough.
I know.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.057
You can spend your whole life
working,

02:15.059 --> 02:18.294
and at the end all that's left
are some papers in a box.

02:18.296 --> 02:21.263
Makes you think.

02:21.265 --> 02:24.033
Oh, well.

02:24.035 --> 02:26.369
Hey. Hey, we're supposed to
look through all this stuff

02:26.371 --> 02:28.304
before we throw it away
in case it's important.

02:28.306 --> 02:31.240
I-I did.
It's all outdated or disproved.

02:31.242 --> 02:34.343
I don't know. This old pen
kind of proves gravity.

02:34.345 --> 02:37.613
When I tilt it, her bathing
suit falls right off.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.748
WOLOWITZ:
Oh,

02:38.750 --> 02:40.750
my dad used to have
a pen like that.

02:40.752 --> 02:44.153
I dated it
all through sixth grade.

02:44.155 --> 02:45.187
It still feels weird

02:45.189 --> 02:47.490
just throwing away his work
like this.

02:47.492 --> 02:48.591
Don't feel bad.
Someday,

02:48.593 --> 02:51.360
someone will be throwing out
your work, too.

02:51.362 --> 02:55.898
That someone was Sheldon,
and the day was yesterday.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.168
Hey, look at this.

02:59.170 --> 03:02.405
"Dear Roger, to be opened
upon your first great discovery.

03:02.407 --> 03:04.473
Love, Mom."

03:04.475 --> 03:06.275
Wow, look at the date.

03:06.277 --> 03:09.645
He saved this 50 years
and never got to open it.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.081
That's intense.

03:12.083 --> 03:15.017
Poor Roger Abbott.

03:15.019 --> 03:19.622
(laughing): Roger Abbott sounds
just like Roger Rabbit.

03:19.624 --> 03:23.592
Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott,
Roger Abbott.

03:23.594 --> 03:27.196
Oh, my God, Leonard, I know
he's dead, but try it. It's fun!

03:28.098 --> 03:29.632
Roger Abbott,
Roger Abbott...

03:30.801 --> 03:33.135
DAN:
Penny!

03:33.137 --> 03:35.838
(chuckles)
Oh, my rookie of the year.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.474
Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want
to hire me

03:38.476 --> 03:40.709
and now's a little hug machine.
(chuckles) Oh,

03:40.711 --> 03:42.311
look at you. Brand-new

03:42.313 --> 03:44.613
and already
the third best sales rep.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.382
Aw. Yes.
Why don't you come over to my table.

03:46.384 --> 03:48.384
I'll be right there.
Bernadette's just parking the car.

03:48.386 --> 03:51.387
Oh, good.

03:51.389 --> 03:54.056
Bernadette. Cute, sweet...

03:54.058 --> 03:55.991
vicious little Bernadette.

03:55.993 --> 03:58.194
Come on. She's not that bad.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.528
Oh, yeah?

03:59.530 --> 04:01.764
At the company picnic
she yelled at me and my grandson

04:01.766 --> 04:03.933
for losing
the three-legged race.

04:03.935 --> 04:09.104
I mean, he still calls her "that
mean kid with the big boobies."

04:09.106 --> 04:11.574
I know she can be
a little intense, but, I swear,

04:11.576 --> 04:14.009
she is so sweet
once you get past all the...

04:14.011 --> 04:15.177
Hey, what are you
talking about?

04:15.179 --> 04:16.579
Oh. We were just talking

04:16.581 --> 04:18.747
about how much we love working
with you. Isn't that right?

04:18.749 --> 04:20.950
Dan?

04:23.987 --> 04:26.322
Over the years here
at Fun With Flags,

04:26.324 --> 04:29.859
we've had an opportunity to
learn, laugh, wonder...

04:29.861 --> 04:33.729
And, yes, even shed
a tear or two.

04:33.731 --> 04:37.399
Like when you do a two-hour
Fourth of July spectacular

04:37.401 --> 04:40.369
and it doesn't
get recorded.

04:40.371 --> 04:43.405
How many times do I have
to say I'm sorry?

04:43.407 --> 04:46.375
How about 4,000.

04:46.377 --> 04:49.445
One for every domino I set up
to make that American flag.

04:50.547 --> 04:53.782
Please enjoy
these highlights.

04:55.185 --> 04:58.487
(Australian accent): Crikey! What flag
do we have today?

05:01.925 --> 05:04.159
(Australian accent):
Australia, mate!

05:07.531 --> 05:11.901
And now it's time for the speed
round of Flag or Not a Flag.

05:11.903 --> 05:14.703
Flag.
Flag. (dinging)

05:14.705 --> 05:16.739
Not a flag.
Flag.

05:16.741 --> 05:19.408
I am crushing this.

05:23.713 --> 05:27.516
Say, Betsy Ross,
what you working on?

05:27.518 --> 05:31.120
(high-pitched):
I have no idea.

05:31.122 --> 05:34.590
Because the story of me
sewing the first American flag

05:34.592 --> 05:37.626
is unsupported
poppycock.

05:37.628 --> 05:40.462
Then who did sew it, hmm?

05:40.464 --> 05:42.197
Don't ask me.

05:42.199 --> 05:45.634
I'm just a simple seamstress
whose descendants are...

05:45.636 --> 05:49.038
(normal voice):
out to make a quick buck!

05:49.040 --> 05:51.240
(old-timey music playing)

05:55.612 --> 05:57.379
Fancy a dip, my dear?

05:57.381 --> 05:59.014
I do.

05:59.016 --> 06:01.016
(gasps)

06:01.018 --> 06:03.752
Wait, that purple
flag indicates

06:03.754 --> 06:06.422
that marine pests, such
as jellyfish, are present.

06:06.424 --> 06:09.758
Wow, that flag
is a lifesaver.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.094
No.

06:12.096 --> 06:14.296
This is.

06:15.799 --> 06:17.967
Stop looking at my legs.

06:19.035 --> 06:21.370
Not a flag.
Flag. (dinging)

06:21.372 --> 06:23.672
Flag.
Not a flag.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.374
Flag.
(buzz)

06:25.376 --> 06:28.210
(groans)
Crap.

06:29.346 --> 06:30.846
When stuff
like this gets me down,

06:30.848 --> 06:32.181
you know what I like to do?

06:32.183 --> 06:35.217
Sing "Hakuna Matata"
like an eight-year-old girl?

06:35.219 --> 06:37.052
Wrong, smarty-pants.

06:37.054 --> 06:40.756
It's "Everything Is Awesome"
from <i>The Lego Movie.</i>

06:42.392 --> 06:43.626
Look at these notebooks.

06:43.628 --> 06:45.661
They're full of pages and pages
of data.

06:45.663 --> 06:47.396
He clearly spent years on this.

06:47.398 --> 06:50.232
Mmm. Oh, it's just columns
of random numbers. Toss it.

06:50.234 --> 06:53.135
Well, but what if this was a
potential breakthrough for him?

06:53.137 --> 06:54.803
What if...
what if this is the thing

06:54.805 --> 06:57.473
that would've finally let him
open that bottle of champagne?

06:57.475 --> 06:59.808
Maybe he didn't know what
to pair champagne with.

06:59.810 --> 07:03.679
Strawberries, caviar, oysters.
All good choices.

07:05.215 --> 07:06.415
Yeah, that look right there

07:06.417 --> 07:09.818
is why people eat before
they come to your parties.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.854
This has to mean something.

07:11.856 --> 07:15.991
Well, there's no discernible
pattern that I can see,

07:15.993 --> 07:18.360
but it shouldn't be too hard
to run the numbers and check.

07:18.362 --> 07:20.996
Well, maybe we can get
some time on the supercomputer.

07:20.998 --> 07:22.898
Sure. We could try
multiple regressions

07:22.900 --> 07:25.401
with varying physical and
experimental constants.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.003
Oh, we could run
a pattern-matching algorithm

07:28.005 --> 07:30.139
against well-known
unsolved physics problems.

07:30.141 --> 07:32.608
Ooh, it might be
a substitution cipher.

07:32.610 --> 07:34.576
We could start
with basic cryptanalysis.

07:34.578 --> 07:38.280
Or we could talk to this guy
he used to share an office with.

07:39.115 --> 07:42.685
Oh, let's do that.

07:42.687 --> 07:45.220
Because you don't know how
to do cryptanalysis, do you?

07:45.222 --> 07:47.723
I'm not even sure if
it's the right word.

07:54.964 --> 07:56.465
PENNY:
So,

07:56.467 --> 07:59.101
Dan, you have a grandson.
How old is he?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.502
Seven.
BERNADETTE: Oh, yeah.

08:00.504 --> 08:02.438
I remember him from the picnic.

08:03.506 --> 08:06.408
He was the one crying
like a wuss the whole time.

08:07.310 --> 08:10.779
I heard he was being picked on
by a mean kid.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.181
Just builds character.

08:12.183 --> 08:14.183
Like my dad said,
"Nobody likes a crybaby

08:14.185 --> 08:16.652
except their mommies
and Democrats."

08:17.487 --> 08:18.887
I need another drink.

08:20.857 --> 08:22.758
What's his problem?
Oh.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.593
I don't know.
Maybe he didn't like the fact

08:24.595 --> 08:26.395
that you called his grandson
a wuss.

08:26.397 --> 08:29.598
Well, I didn't think you were
supposed to say "sissy" anymore.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.135
Okay, look, I know
what a good person you are,

08:33.136 --> 08:36.572
but sometimes people think you
might come off a little harsh.

08:36.573 --> 08:37.639
What?

08:37.640 --> 08:40.241
I'm, like, the sweetest person
I know.

08:41.277 --> 08:45.347
Look at me. I should be
in a tree baking cookies.

08:45.349 --> 08:47.316
Yes, but once in a while,

08:47.318 --> 08:50.619
people think
you're a little mean.

08:50.621 --> 08:51.854
Oh, yeah?

08:51.856 --> 08:53.622
You one of those people?

08:54.457 --> 08:56.325
No. No, no, no.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.294
I-I think the cookie thing.

09:03.299 --> 09:04.833
Action.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.468
Welcome back.

09:06.470 --> 09:09.204
Our guest today
is a returning fan favorite.

09:09.206 --> 09:11.573
He puts the reading
in your rainbow,

09:11.575 --> 09:13.108
the Geordi in your La Forge,

09:13.110 --> 09:15.043
and the Kunta in your Kinte,

09:15.045 --> 09:17.246
Mr. LeVar Burton.

09:21.518 --> 09:24.219
Thank you, Sheldon.
Now, remember our deal...

09:24.221 --> 09:28.657
You do this, I delete
your contact information.

09:28.659 --> 09:29.792
While...

09:29.794 --> 09:31.860
While you watch me do it.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.896
Great. Happy to be back.

09:33.898 --> 09:35.497
Well, since you're here,

09:35.499 --> 09:37.966
I'd like to get your
opinion on something.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.035
In honor of Black
History Month,

09:40.037 --> 09:42.070
I portrayed George
Washington Carver

09:42.072 --> 09:46.675
in a loving tribute that my
roommate called "wildly racist""

09:46.677 --> 09:48.744
What do you think?

09:48.746 --> 09:50.979
SHELDON:
Hi. My name is George.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.148
Oh, hell, no!

09:55.785 --> 09:57.686
You heard him, Leonard.

09:57.688 --> 09:59.855
No, it's not racist.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:09.110 --> 10:11.278
Are we sure this is the place?

10:11.280 --> 10:13.347
The doorman said this
is the right building.

10:13.349 --> 10:15.282
I think if you're pulling up
your pants,

10:15.284 --> 10:17.651
you're not a doorman.

10:17.653 --> 10:19.086
MAN:
Who is it?

10:19.088 --> 10:21.221
Uh, I'm looking
for a Professor Sharpe?

10:21.223 --> 10:24.157
Hold on.

10:24.159 --> 10:25.726
Can I help you?
Hi.

10:25.728 --> 10:27.928
We're from the university. We're
trying to get some information

10:27.930 --> 10:29.196
about Professor Abbott.

10:29.198 --> 10:30.631
We were cleaning
out his office

10:30.633 --> 10:32.366
and found these books
full of numbers.

10:32.368 --> 10:34.001
Any chance you
know what it is?

10:34.003 --> 10:35.802
Yes, he was always working on this.
Oh.

10:35.804 --> 10:37.204
I was thinking
it might be

10:37.206 --> 10:39.206
some sort of interstellar
coordinate system,

10:39.208 --> 10:41.041
maybe an updated version
of Hubble's law.

10:41.043 --> 10:42.442
I keep seeing the
number 90 repeating.

10:42.444 --> 10:44.444
That could be the angle
of perturbation

10:44.446 --> 10:46.413
of a distant galaxy.

10:46.415 --> 10:49.216
It's the number
of calories in a yogurt.

10:49.951 --> 10:51.318
That's his food diary.

10:51.320 --> 10:52.753
Really?

10:52.755 --> 10:54.621
Yeah, he wrote down
everything he ever ate.

10:54.623 --> 10:56.823
He was convinced that calorie
restriction was the key

10:56.825 --> 10:58.225
to living forever.

10:58.227 --> 10:59.893
Does it work?

10:59.895 --> 11:01.328
Seriously?

11:01.330 --> 11:04.231
Well, he could have been hit
by a bus. You don't know.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.434
Sorry it's not more interesting.

11:07.436 --> 11:09.536
On the bright side,
you didn't have to listen

11:09.538 --> 11:12.272
to his stomach growl
for 35 years.

11:12.274 --> 11:14.541
So, was there anything
that Professor Abbott worked on

11:14.543 --> 11:17.511
during his life that came close
to an accomplishment?

11:17.513 --> 11:20.981
To be honest, his research
never amounted to anything.

11:20.983 --> 11:23.050
Oh.
You were his colleague.

11:23.052 --> 11:24.051
How did your research turn out?

11:24.053 --> 11:26.086
Great. Hey, this is
the apartment you get

11:26.088 --> 11:28.288
when you win a Nobel.

11:29.323 --> 11:31.358
Well, you could be very frugal.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.760
I'm getting a little tired
of everybody's sarcasm.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.266
I'm not a bully.

11:39.268 --> 11:41.368
I mean, maybe I come
off a little strong,

11:41.370 --> 11:43.370
but that's only because my
dad raised me to be tough

11:43.372 --> 11:44.938
and not to take
crap from anybody.

11:44.940 --> 11:48.241
No. That's fine, but there's
a difference between being tough

11:48.243 --> 11:51.611
and telling your friend her new
pants look like a saggy diaper.

11:53.648 --> 11:55.782
I did say that, didn't I?

11:55.784 --> 11:57.084
Yeah, you did.

11:57.086 --> 12:00.020
I felt so self-conscious,
I had to return them.

12:00.022 --> 12:02.989
Where? To Babies R Us?

12:02.991 --> 12:05.659
You're doing it again!

12:05.661 --> 12:07.027
Okay, sorry.
Can we just go?

12:07.029 --> 12:08.495
I feel like
everybody hates me.

12:08.497 --> 12:10.497
Oh, come on,
they don't hate you, all right?

12:10.499 --> 12:11.631
They're just
a little intimidated.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.200
All you need to do
is show everyone

12:13.202 --> 12:14.367
how sweet you really are.

12:14.369 --> 12:16.369
I think I'd rather go.
No, come on.

12:16.371 --> 12:18.004
You are not going anywhere,
all right?

12:18.006 --> 12:20.340
I am here for you, and we are
gonna fix this together.

12:20.342 --> 12:21.742
Thank you.

12:21.744 --> 12:23.677
Even though your dress is ugly.

12:26.481 --> 12:28.882
Well, my little Flag-keteers,

12:28.884 --> 12:32.886
it looks like the last episode
of Fun with Flags is at an end.

12:32.888 --> 12:34.788
If I could,

12:34.790 --> 12:38.892
I would run each and every one
of you viewers up a flagpole

12:38.894 --> 12:41.795
and salute you.

12:41.797 --> 12:44.297
And if you touched the ground,
burn you.

12:45.867 --> 12:47.300
I'd like to take a moment

12:47.302 --> 12:49.469
to personally thank
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

12:49.471 --> 12:51.471
who you may
or may not know

12:51.473 --> 12:55.842
is the first woman to co-host
a flag or banner-related

12:55.844 --> 12:58.678
Internet info-tainment show.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.148
Take that, glass ceiling.

13:02.817 --> 13:06.820
And if I may get serious
for a moment,

13:06.822 --> 13:10.791
hosting this show has been...

13:10.793 --> 13:12.993
one crazy ride.

13:14.195 --> 13:16.730
With all its ups and downs,

13:16.732 --> 13:19.599
I wouldn't give it up
for the world.

13:21.002 --> 13:23.236
Except for now,
when I'm giving it up.

13:26.574 --> 13:28.842
Before I sign off, I'd, uh...

13:28.844 --> 13:33.246
I'd like to share with you all
one last use for a white flag.

13:34.849 --> 13:37.250
(voice breaking):
It's good for times like this.

13:38.553 --> 13:39.953
(sniffles)

13:39.955 --> 13:42.088
Good night.

13:42.090 --> 13:43.290
Cut.

13:45.126 --> 13:47.694
Sheldon...

13:47.696 --> 13:49.863
that was beautiful.

13:49.865 --> 13:51.031
If you didn't press record...

13:51.033 --> 13:53.200
I pressed it!

13:57.238 --> 14:00.340
Well, that's it.

14:00.342 --> 14:03.043
That's the end of Roger Abbott.

14:05.613 --> 14:07.914
And we still don't know
who framed him.

14:10.384 --> 14:12.052
I still keep thinking

14:12.054 --> 14:14.654
about how an entire life can
seemingly amount to nothing.

14:14.656 --> 14:17.390
I guess the
sad truth is,

14:17.392 --> 14:20.961
not everyone will
accomplish something great.

14:20.963 --> 14:22.462
Some of us

14:22.464 --> 14:24.431
may just have to find meaning

14:24.433 --> 14:28.034
in the little moments
that make up life.

14:28.036 --> 14:31.137
That's a nice way
of looking at it.

14:31.139 --> 14:33.106
Yeah for you, not for me.

14:33.108 --> 14:35.175
I went to space. I'm covered.

14:37.812 --> 14:39.446
You know what?

14:39.448 --> 14:42.649
This bottle was meant
to celebrate an achievement.

14:42.651 --> 14:44.017
Let's make a pact.

14:44.019 --> 14:46.319
When one of us gets their
first big breakthrough,

14:46.321 --> 14:48.955
we'll celebrate by opening
this bottle of champagne

14:48.957 --> 14:50.957
and toasting
Professor Abbott.

14:50.959 --> 14:52.158
I love that.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.226
Yeah, me, too.

14:53.228 --> 14:55.028
Then, of course,

14:55.030 --> 14:56.796
rubbing our success
in Sheldon's face.

14:56.798 --> 14:59.132
Oh, well, that's the best part.
Oh, yeah.

15:00.234 --> 15:03.803
Dan, could I talk
to you for a minute?

15:07.008 --> 15:08.975
Sure, go ahead.

15:08.977 --> 15:10.744
Just want you to know
I didn't mean

15:10.746 --> 15:12.012
to be rude about your grandson.

15:12.014 --> 15:13.680
No, it's okay.

15:13.682 --> 15:15.548
No, it's not.

15:15.550 --> 15:17.117
Penny told me
that everyone's scared of me.

15:17.119 --> 15:19.386
(laughing):
What? What?

15:19.388 --> 15:21.288
Why would she say that?

15:21.290 --> 15:22.956
You know she drinks, right?

15:22.958 --> 15:24.891
What?

15:24.893 --> 15:27.294
No, she's right,
and I just want you to know

15:27.296 --> 15:29.696
that from now on, I'm gonna be
much more sensitive.

15:29.698 --> 15:31.731
I don't want anyone walking
on eggshells around me.

15:31.733 --> 15:34.267
Oh, well, okay, then, uh,

15:34.269 --> 15:36.202
one thing
I've been meaning to tell you

15:36.204 --> 15:39.005
is that the company is gonna
stop paying for our coffee.

15:39.007 --> 15:40.907
No problem. When
does that start?

15:40.909 --> 15:43.043
Five months ago.

15:43.045 --> 15:44.311
What?!
Yeah.

15:44.313 --> 15:46.012
Who's been paying
for my coffee?

15:46.014 --> 15:47.014
All of us.

15:47.015 --> 15:48.715
Yeah. It comes
from the swear jar

15:48.717 --> 15:50.483
we put money in when you curse.

15:53.788 --> 15:55.422
What else don't I know about?

15:55.424 --> 15:58.258
Uh, well, you know
your private bathroom?

15:58.260 --> 15:58.915
Yeah?

15:58.939 --> 16:00.695
That was supposed to
be for the whole floor.

16:00.696 --> 16:02.829
You're kidding.
DAN: No, no.

16:02.831 --> 16:05.298
It's okay. It only really
affected Wheelchair Kathy,

16:05.300 --> 16:07.667
and she's back
in the hospital now,

16:07.669 --> 16:09.669
so it all worked out.

16:09.671 --> 16:12.872
I feel so bad.
Yeah.

16:12.874 --> 16:14.140
Well, then, maybe

16:14.142 --> 16:16.042
you shouldn't have named her
"Wheelchair Kathy."

16:17.411 --> 16:19.012
Oh, my God!

16:19.014 --> 16:22.482
I thought everybody liked me,
but I'm just a monster.

16:22.484 --> 16:26.353
But a cute one, like that, uh,
eyeball guy in <i>Monsters, Inc.</i>

16:26.355 --> 16:29.022
No, I'm the worst.

16:29.024 --> 16:30.690
I'm a terrible person.

16:30.692 --> 16:33.159
Come on, don't cry.
It's okay.

16:33.161 --> 16:34.394
(crying):
It's not okay.

16:34.396 --> 16:37.063
How can I even work here anymore?
Oh.

16:37.065 --> 16:38.698
Because this company needs you.
DAN: It's fine.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.433
We don't mind paying
for the coffee.

16:40.435 --> 16:42.836
I can't let you do that.

16:42.838 --> 16:44.471
Maybe we could get you

16:44.473 --> 16:46.706
an espresso machine
for your office.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.742
(crying):
I guess that would be all right.

16:48.744 --> 16:50.744
All right.

16:50.746 --> 16:53.146
(crying)
See? You don't have

16:53.148 --> 16:54.714
to be mean
to get what you want.

16:54.716 --> 16:56.750
(sniffles)
You're right.

16:56.752 --> 16:59.619
Now where did we land
on my bathroom?

17:02.823 --> 17:04.257
(door opening)

17:04.259 --> 17:05.759
Hey.

17:05.761 --> 17:06.960
Hello.

17:06.962 --> 17:08.294
How come you're up so late?

17:08.296 --> 17:10.195
I posted the last episode

17:10.198 --> 17:12.232
of Fun with Flags hours ago,

17:12.233 --> 17:15.001
and not a single person
cared enough to comment.

17:16.837 --> 17:19.138
All that effort for nothing.

17:19.141 --> 17:21.107
Mm. I know how you feel.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.843
I spent the day throwing out
a man's entire career,

17:23.845 --> 17:25.678
and all that's left is
an old bottle of champagne

17:25.680 --> 17:28.048
and a naked lady pen
that Raj took

17:28.050 --> 17:30.650
when he thought
no one was looking.

17:30.652 --> 17:33.486
It's not the same thing.

17:33.488 --> 17:36.156
I don't think you know
how I feel at all.

17:36.158 --> 17:38.625
Sad?

17:38.627 --> 17:41.795
Hmm. You do get me.

17:42.963 --> 17:44.998
(computer chimes)

17:45.000 --> 17:46.833
Someone left a comment.

17:46.835 --> 17:48.101
Yeah. What did they say?

17:48.103 --> 17:50.103
"Too bad your show is done.

17:50.105 --> 17:52.105
I kind of liked it."

17:52.107 --> 17:54.307
Leonard, did you hear that?

17:55.476 --> 17:57.644
Oh, the people are heartbroken!

17:59.447 --> 18:02.048
I can't take this away
from the world!

18:02.050 --> 18:04.984
Fun with Flags is back!

18:04.986 --> 18:06.986
Congratulations.

18:06.988 --> 18:08.855
Let's celebrate!

18:08.857 --> 18:10.390
(cork pops)

18:10.392 --> 18:13.059
Sheldon,

18:13.061 --> 18:14.761
that wasn't for you!

18:14.763 --> 18:16.296
Oh, no, I'm not going
to drink it.

18:16.298 --> 18:17.797
I just wanted to hear the pop.

18:18.766 --> 18:22.335
Yeah, I knew it was coming.
Still scary.

18:34.104 --> 18:36.239
LeVar Burton?

18:36.241 --> 18:38.041
LeVar Burton!

18:38.043 --> 18:39.642
LeVar Burton!

18:39.644 --> 18:43.179
Ugh. What are you doing here?

18:43.181 --> 18:44.514
You told me not to call,

18:44.516 --> 18:46.950
and I didn't know how else
to give you the good news.

18:46.952 --> 18:50.653
Fun with Flags is back, and
you can be in the next episode.

18:50.655 --> 18:52.055
Wil Wheaton said, get a gate.

18:52.057 --> 18:53.527
I don't know why
I didn't get a gate.

18:53.551 --> 18:54.658
You...

18:54.961 --> 18:57.395
At least listen
to the premise.

18:57.398 --> 18:58.964
Since you were born
in Germany,

18:58.966 --> 19:01.900
I thought we could talk
about German flags.

19:01.901 --> 19:04.944
How do you feel about
dressing up like a swastika?
