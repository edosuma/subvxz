WEBVTT

00:00.102 --> 00:02.023
Previously onHawaii Five-O...

00:02.048 --> 00:03.127
The men you're looking for

00:03.171 --> 00:04.854
just slipped into the adjoining room.

00:04.898 --> 00:06.096
Who is this?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.239
Trust me, they're in there.

00:07.283 --> 00:09.241
- You let them get away?
- Who are you?

00:09.285 --> 00:10.329
I'm the guy on the phone.

00:10.373 --> 00:12.810
You guys are our only witnesses.
We're working together.

00:12.853 --> 00:14.290
Somehow,
your client's husband got his hands

00:14.333 --> 00:15.552
on the NOC list.

00:15.595 --> 00:17.162
If those names are made public,

00:17.206 --> 00:19.164
it would be a huge blow for
American counterintelligence.

00:20.948 --> 00:22.646
I got the NOC list.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.082
Well,

00:24.126 --> 00:26.258
I think we've gotten in your way
enough for one day.

00:26.302 --> 00:29.019
I was just about to, uh, return
this list of names to the CIA,

00:29.062 --> 00:30.963
make sure they don't fall
in the wrong hands again.

00:31.007 --> 00:32.177
Hey, T, what's up?

00:32.220 --> 00:34.331
I was wondering if you wanted
to get a drink tonight.

00:34.375 --> 00:35.702
Yeah, I would love that.

00:43.014 --> 00:45.101
Man, I'm beat.

00:45.799 --> 00:46.974
Want a beer?

00:47.018 --> 00:49.216
Yeah, I'd love one, actually. Thanks.

00:50.456 --> 00:53.729
It's been a crazy 36 hours.

00:53.773 --> 00:56.135
Indeed it has.
I mean, who would've thought

00:56.179 --> 00:59.552
that a run-of-the-mill stakeout
to find a cheating husband

00:59.596 --> 01:01.859
would escalate into a
full-blown espionage case?

01:01.902 --> 01:03.600
I had no idea.

01:03.643 --> 01:06.385
How about that McGarrett guy?
He's something, eh?

01:06.429 --> 01:08.605
Why? Because he runs a task force?

01:08.648 --> 01:10.650
That just means he needs help
doing his job.

01:10.694 --> 01:12.722
Yeah, well, he's got that cool clubhouse

01:12.765 --> 01:14.306
and all those nifty toys.

01:14.350 --> 01:17.266
He's also a classic Type A.

01:17.309 --> 01:19.268
- Very reckless.
- Well,

01:19.311 --> 01:21.444
you can't argue with
those results, though, Magnum.

01:21.487 --> 01:23.576
You know, I got his number
if you want to give him a call.

01:23.620 --> 01:24.987
He might be hiring.

01:25.031 --> 01:27.014
Don't be childish.
It's not a competition.

01:27.058 --> 01:28.320
Then why are you trying to make it one?

01:28.364 --> 01:30.453
'Cause, Peter Pan,

01:30.496 --> 01:33.049
I'm just pointing out
what's obvious to me.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.566
What is that supposed to mean?

01:34.609 --> 01:36.981
Well, I mean, you and McGarrett
are pretty similar in some ways.

01:37.024 --> 01:38.809
You're both equally reckless.

01:38.852 --> 01:40.637
You're both good at getting the job done.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.565
Small difference is that he's
a fully-functioning adult,

01:44.609 --> 01:47.557
whilst you still have
a little growing up to do.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.733
Why, because I don't punch a clock?

01:49.776 --> 01:52.692
Sorry, but that's not who I am.

01:52.736 --> 01:54.687
I didn't move to this island
to work a nine-to-five.

01:54.730 --> 01:55.913
Yeah, I mean,

01:55.956 --> 01:58.176
why go into an office every day
when you can just mooch off

01:58.220 --> 02:00.047
Robin Masters for the rest of your life,

02:00.091 --> 02:02.354
sharing your P.I. workload with me?

02:02.398 --> 02:05.120
You know what? McGarrett should
actually be jealous of you.

02:05.164 --> 02:06.706
You've managed to hack adult life

02:06.750 --> 02:09.926
whilst also managing
to shirk responsibility...

02:12.321 --> 02:14.117
...entirely.

Good night, Magnum.

03:38.232 --> 03:39.321
Hey!

04:37.267 --> 04:38.616
Give me your phone.

04:45.604 --> 04:47.563
- Where are the rest?
- There's no "rest."

04:47.606 --> 04:49.434
I knew they got McGarrett,
but Danny and Grover, too?

04:49.478 --> 04:50.566
It's just us.

04:52.002 --> 04:54.352
What's the plan?

04:55.397 --> 04:56.920
We get help.

05:39.092 --> 05:40.833
What's the matter, big guy?

05:40.877 --> 05:42.661
What do you mean?

05:42.705 --> 05:44.837
I mean, you look like a scared kid

05:44.881 --> 05:46.578
on his first day of preschool.

05:49.494 --> 05:50.626
Yeah, what happened?

05:50.669 --> 05:52.454
You suddenly become afraid of the water?

05:52.497 --> 05:54.456
No, my brother, I am not.

05:54.499 --> 05:56.240
But I am afraid of sharks,

05:56.283 --> 05:58.590
and there's been a few sightings lately.

05:58.634 --> 06:00.113
Oh, come on. Why'd you come?

06:00.157 --> 06:01.898
Peer pressure.

06:03.943 --> 06:07.338
You know, Hawaiians have
revered sharks for generations.

06:07.381 --> 06:11.466
They're known as aumakua,
ancestors reincarnated

06:11.509 --> 06:14.203
as animals sent here
to protect family members.

06:14.247 --> 06:16.956
That would make me feel better
if I had any ancestors here.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.567
But I do not.

06:18.610 --> 06:21.178
So if those aumakua feel
like they want a snickety-snack,

06:21.221 --> 06:23.876
guess who's gonna have
a shark's tooth in his ass. Me!

06:23.920 --> 06:26.705
No, you're all muscle, man.
You're too chewy.

06:26.749 --> 06:28.679
Now, Rick, on the other hand...

06:28.723 --> 06:30.622
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, now. Come on.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.450
I resent that.

06:32.494 --> 06:33.886
This is all man right here.

06:33.930 --> 06:35.932
Yeah, I know. Whoa!

06:35.975 --> 06:37.542
The hell was that?

06:37.586 --> 06:39.588
That would be Higgins.

06:41.328 --> 06:43.026
Time to go, fellas.

06:53.074 --> 06:54.467
What's going on?

06:55.429 --> 06:57.065
These guys need our help.

06:57.109 --> 06:58.563
Junior's been kidnapped.

06:59.695 --> 07:01.378
Whoever's took him called McGarrett.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.506
They want to trade him for the NOC list.

07:06.789 --> 07:09.574
This has got to be Daiyu Mei.
She was after the list.

07:09.618 --> 07:11.445
Well, she's certainly
the most likely suspect.

07:14.187 --> 07:16.102
- What's he gonna do?
- Well, there's nothing he can do.

07:16.146 --> 07:17.495
After he got the ransom call,

07:17.539 --> 07:19.088
CIA rounded up Five-O to make sure

07:19.132 --> 07:20.367
we wouldn't even consider a trade.

07:20.411 --> 07:22.315
They don't care about Junior,
they just care about the list.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.893
As far as they're concerned,
Junior's collateral.

07:26.548 --> 07:28.506
McGarrett texted us a warning
before they moved in.

07:28.550 --> 07:30.116
Tani and I were the only ones
who got away.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.684
These kidnappers, they set a deadline?

07:32.728 --> 07:34.338
Noon, today.

07:34.381 --> 07:37.065
If they don't get the list
by then, Junior dies.

07:41.737 --> 07:44.386
We have to find him,
and we can't do it alone.

07:44.429 --> 07:46.332
Quinn and I are fugitives on this island.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.918
CIA, FBI, HPD,
they're all looking for us.

07:48.961 --> 07:50.441
Yeah, and we're sorry
we had to come here,

07:50.484 --> 07:51.616
but we didn't have a choice.

07:51.660 --> 07:53.400
No, no, it's okay, it's just...

07:53.444 --> 07:55.620
noon only gives us four hours.

07:55.664 --> 07:57.317
That's not much time.
We stand a better chance

07:57.361 --> 07:59.145
of finding the list than we do Junior.

07:59.189 --> 08:00.494
How do you figure?

08:00.538 --> 08:02.496
CIA got it when they grabbed McGarrett.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.648
I don't think so. If they did,
they would've released him

08:04.691 --> 08:06.042
by now, along with the rest of your team.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.191
- And since they haven't...
- McGarrett must not have had it on him

08:08.234 --> 08:09.354
when they picked him up.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.680
CIA's probably interrogating
each of them right now,

08:11.723 --> 08:13.072
trying to leverage them to give it up.

08:13.116 --> 08:15.466
Hang on, if they don't
have it, then where is it?

08:15.509 --> 08:18.050
My guess is he probably hid it somewhere.

08:18.093 --> 08:19.905
Which means if we find it,
we can make a deal.

08:19.949 --> 08:21.603
Except handing over
that list would essentially

08:21.646 --> 08:23.822
burn all of the deep cover agents on it.

08:23.866 --> 08:25.650
I mean, that would be

08:25.694 --> 08:27.441
a death sentence
for every single one of them.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.699
If we don't hand over the list,
they'll kill Junior.

08:36.457 --> 08:38.315
Uh, there is a third option.

08:39.533 --> 08:40.664
What's that?

08:40.708 --> 08:42.624
If we find the list and we can decode it,

08:42.667 --> 08:44.756
we can warn the agents who are on it.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.671
Giving them enough time
for an extraction.

08:46.715 --> 08:48.281
That could work.

08:50.980 --> 08:52.677
Well, i-it sounds
like you guys have a plan,

08:52.721 --> 08:54.636
but how are you gonna get all
this done before the deadline?

08:55.854 --> 08:57.813
I don't know,
but we're gonna have to try.

08:57.856 --> 08:59.336
Okay.

08:59.379 --> 09:00.816
Let's start with McGarrett's house.

09:00.859 --> 09:02.074
You two can stay here in the meanwhile.

09:02.117 --> 09:03.304
Thanks, but we're coming with you.

09:03.347 --> 09:04.863
No. That's not gonna happen.

09:04.906 --> 09:08.040
You two are the most wanted
people on the island.

09:08.084 --> 09:09.825
We got this.

09:14.438 --> 09:16.266
I've taken pro bono cases before,

09:16.309 --> 09:19.704
but never one that had a ticking
clock with a life on the line.

09:19.748 --> 09:22.751
And the fact that it's the life
of a fellow Navy SEAL at stake,

09:22.794 --> 09:24.745
a man who served his country,

09:24.789 --> 09:26.798
only makes it that more heart-wrenching.

09:40.507 --> 09:42.422
Looks like the CIA beat us to it.

09:42.466 --> 09:45.556
They must have also assumed
that McGarrett hid the list.

09:45.599 --> 09:47.863
The question is, did they find anything?

09:49.299 --> 09:50.517
Right.

10:08.753 --> 10:11.538
Hello. Good boy.

10:12.801 --> 10:14.454
Ooh, okay...

10:15.804 --> 10:17.980
Easy.

10:19.024 --> 10:20.243
Easy, boy.

10:21.505 --> 10:24.029
Uh, Magnum?

10:24.073 --> 10:25.901
Magnum? Magnum.

10:27.337 --> 10:28.664
- What is it?
- Stay.

10:31.820 --> 10:34.257
Oh, look at this.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.693
Isn't that interesting?

10:35.737 --> 10:37.869
I-I don't think he likes me.

10:37.913 --> 10:39.001
Yeah.

10:39.044 --> 10:40.742
Didn't you once say that dogs were

10:40.785 --> 10:42.308
excellent judges of character?

10:42.352 --> 10:44.658
Oh, my God, you're enjoying this. Stay...

10:44.702 --> 10:46.486
You have no idea
how much I'm enjoying this.

10:47.923 --> 10:50.055
- It's not too much fun, is it?
- Just do something.

10:50.099 --> 10:52.579
Okay, I will.

10:52.623 --> 10:53.972
Oh, really?

10:54.016 --> 10:55.887
I've just gotta get one shot.
This is beautiful.

10:59.804 --> 11:00.979
I'm gonna have to use this picture

11:01.023 --> 11:02.938
for your caller ID, Higgy, I'm sorry.

11:02.981 --> 11:04.940
I swear, the next time Zeus
and Apollo have you cornered,

11:04.983 --> 11:06.724
I'm going to completely
ignore your pleas for help.

11:06.768 --> 11:07.899
Relax. Come here, buddy.

11:07.943 --> 11:09.379
Come here, boy.

11:09.422 --> 11:12.469
Yeah. Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

11:12.512 --> 11:13.818
Yeah, who's a nice guy?

11:13.862 --> 11:15.733
Yeah, good boy. He's not mean.

11:15.777 --> 11:16.734
He's super nice.

11:16.778 --> 11:19.868
Oh, yeah, who's a good boy?

11:19.911 --> 11:22.131
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

11:22.174 --> 11:25.743
Right. No list, then?

11:25.787 --> 11:28.398
No. I mean, the CIA is pretty thorough.

11:28.441 --> 11:30.182
There's no way it's here.
I did try calling McGarrett

11:30.226 --> 11:31.575
and Grover, and nobody picked up.

11:31.618 --> 11:33.316
Probably means they're still
in CIA custody,

11:33.359 --> 11:35.753
and the NOC list is still in the wind.

11:43.688 --> 11:44.980
Hello.

11:45.023 --> 11:46.982
The CIA searched it.
You're not gonna find anything.

11:47.025 --> 11:50.376
So McGarrett texted Tani
a warning about the CIA

11:50.420 --> 11:52.552
shortly before they
took him into custody.

11:52.596 --> 11:54.076
So I'm thinking I can check his cloud

11:54.119 --> 11:56.861
to figure out where
that text was sent from.

11:56.905 --> 11:58.471
Which was there.

11:58.515 --> 12:01.126
His phone last pinged from a
cell tower near Helemano Farms.

12:01.170 --> 12:02.998
That's a pretty remote area.

12:03.041 --> 12:05.827
Right? Good place to hide a list.

12:22.104 --> 12:24.062
If McGarrett hid the NOC list out here...

12:24.106 --> 12:26.369
It would take an entire
search team weeks to find it.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.501
And we have less than three hours.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.962
Thomas, we have some
very antsy badges here.

12:40.006 --> 12:41.355
Tell me you got something.

12:41.398 --> 12:44.227
Not yet. Higgins is trying
to narrow the search now.

12:44.271 --> 12:45.489
How's that going, by the way?

12:45.533 --> 12:46.882
These are the satellite images

12:46.926 --> 12:48.623
from the time that McGarrett
sent that warning text.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.669
They're in three minute
intervals. I'm just hoping that

12:50.712 --> 12:53.193
we're gonna be able
to catch him on one of them.

12:53.236 --> 12:54.455
There.

12:54.498 --> 12:55.499
What do you got?

12:58.415 --> 13:00.363
- McGarrett's truck.
- Okay, great,

13:00.407 --> 13:02.410
but what are the chances
you're actually gonna catch him

13:02.454 --> 13:04.701
at the exact moment he's hiding the list?

13:05.640 --> 13:07.020
Hold on, what's that?

13:08.774 --> 13:10.384
That's another vehicle.

13:10.427 --> 13:12.066
Maybe he met somebody there.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.723
Hey, Rick, it looks your buddy
Kamekona's truck.

13:21.470 --> 13:22.591
Kammy?

13:22.634 --> 13:24.616
McGarrett didn't come here
to hide the list.

13:24.659 --> 13:26.313
It was a handoff.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.793
I think we got something.

13:49.945 --> 13:52.078
- Stay here.
- Not a chance.

13:52.121 --> 13:54.210
CIA's still looking for us.
We got to lay low.

14:06.134 --> 14:08.746
- Kammy!
- Rick Wright.

14:08.790 --> 14:10.879
- Hey.
- TC.

14:10.922 --> 14:13.751
Saw that Island Hoppers
dropped a half star on Yelp.

14:13.795 --> 14:15.188
Yeah, I saw that, too.

14:15.231 --> 14:18.930
Got dinged in the reviews
by a user named "KK54."

14:18.974 --> 14:21.563
You wouldn't know anything
about that now, would you?

14:21.606 --> 14:22.934
All right, listen, you guys are gonna

14:22.978 --> 14:24.284
have to work this out on your own time.

14:24.327 --> 14:25.589
We're on the clock here.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.809
Listen, Kammy,
we're gonna need that SD card.

14:28.184 --> 14:29.767
What SD card?

14:29.811 --> 14:31.334
The one McGarrett gave you.

14:32.158 --> 14:33.945
I think you two got the wrong idea.

14:33.989 --> 14:36.557
I'm in the food
and leisure activity business.

14:37.949 --> 14:40.029
What is taking so long?

14:40.648 --> 14:43.259
Look, we know he slipped it
to you, all right?

14:43.303 --> 14:45.261
Us and Five-O, we're on the same side.

14:45.305 --> 14:48.786
I still don't understand
what you two lolos getting at.

14:48.830 --> 14:50.875
Come on, man, this cat
Junior's life is at stake.

14:50.919 --> 14:53.487
He could be dead in two hours
if you don't give it up.

14:53.530 --> 14:55.706
He's telling the truth.
Look, Magnum and Higgins,

14:55.750 --> 14:57.708
they're working with Tani
and Quinn from Five-O.

15:03.323 --> 15:04.846
Hello?

15:04.889 --> 15:07.240
Give them the NOC list or
I'm gonna burn down your truck.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.680
Yes, ma'am.

15:17.946 --> 15:19.948
Yo. Take care of it, man.

15:19.991 --> 15:22.769
I swore to McGarrett
I'd protect it with my life.

15:22.813 --> 15:24.822
Kammy, come on, it's Rick and TC.

15:26.195 --> 15:27.762
Peace, brother.

15:36.443 --> 15:39.446
- Thank God.
- We still have to trade it.

15:39.489 --> 15:42.231
Yup. This ain't over yet.

15:51.892 --> 15:53.892
_

16:01.032 --> 16:02.556
What's taking so long?

16:02.599 --> 16:05.036
- This SD card is heavily encrypted.
- Can you get in?

16:05.080 --> 16:07.561
I'm trying, but it's complicated.

16:07.604 --> 16:08.953
How bad is it?

16:08.997 --> 16:12.043
Honestly, it could take days.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.350
We don't have days.

16:15.704 --> 16:18.311
Who's that?

16:18.354 --> 16:19.834
I don't know.

16:19.877 --> 16:21.357
What, maybe a neighbor?

16:21.401 --> 16:23.348
No, all visitors have to be
let in at the front gate.

16:23.391 --> 16:24.942
Stay out of sight, please.

16:30.584 --> 16:32.281
Great.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.065
Gordie.

16:34.685 --> 16:36.807
What's going on?

16:36.851 --> 16:38.461
I should ask you that.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.856
How'd you get past the gate?

16:42.751 --> 16:44.728
Friendly tip, as head of security,

16:44.772 --> 16:46.605
you might consider updating
the code every now and again.

16:46.649 --> 16:48.282
As much as I appreciate the feedback,

16:48.325 --> 16:49.876
I don't think that's why you're here.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.649
Got an APB on your new friends
from Five-O.

16:52.693 --> 16:54.869
Considering I heard you
and Higgins were with them

16:54.912 --> 16:56.914
yesterday, I figured you might
know where to find them.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.003
I can't help you.

16:59.891 --> 17:01.284
I know they're here, Magnum.

17:01.309 --> 17:02.745
Tani Rey's car's in the driveway.

17:02.964 --> 17:05.880
Look, CIA is after them
and the governor's

17:05.923 --> 17:08.143
ordered HPD to assist,
no questions asked.

17:08.185 --> 17:10.101
I suggest you park the car in the garage

17:10.145 --> 17:11.319
until things die down.

17:11.722 --> 17:13.540
Why the heads up?

17:15.246 --> 17:17.901
I have a problem going after
Five-O without a good reason,

17:17.925 --> 17:19.189
and I haven't gotten one yet.

17:19.214 --> 17:21.347
So you'll keep this to yourself?

17:21.372 --> 17:22.939
As long as you loop me in.

17:26.204 --> 17:27.571
Come here.

17:29.859 --> 17:31.382
I thought this was your thing.

17:31.407 --> 17:32.756
Well, she's actually
got a lot of "things,"

17:32.781 --> 17:33.869
but, yeah, this is one of them.

17:33.894 --> 17:35.243
Nevertheless, this level of encryption

17:35.268 --> 17:37.306
is just far beyond my skill set.

17:37.346 --> 17:39.870
Then we have no choice,
we have to hand it over as is.

17:39.914 --> 17:41.350
Didn't you guys just
get finished telling me

17:41.394 --> 17:43.221
that every NOC on that list
will be in immediate danger?

17:43.265 --> 17:44.832
If we don't turn it over,
Junior will die.

17:46.507 --> 17:48.488
There has to be something we can do.

17:48.531 --> 17:49.837
Look, Higgy, if you

17:49.880 --> 17:52.181
- can't crack it, then who can?
- I suspect no one.

17:52.224 --> 17:53.623
Guys, that is not an answer.

17:54.557 --> 17:55.930
Y-Yeah, there is someone that can help,

17:55.973 --> 17:57.410
but it's not a hacker.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.151
- Then who?
- A programmer.

18:00.195 --> 18:01.927
You mean, whoever encrypted it
in the first place?

18:01.970 --> 18:03.894
Whoever wrote that code
should be able to crack it.

18:03.938 --> 18:05.983
- We just need to find them.
- We should talk to our client.

18:06.027 --> 18:07.637
See if she can point us in the direction

18:07.681 --> 18:10.510
of whoever her husband used, or
give us access to his computer.

18:13.068 --> 18:14.547
It's worth a shot.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.039
And what if we're wrong?

18:20.563 --> 18:22.130
People usually say,

18:22.173 --> 18:24.872
"I can't imagine how you feel,"

18:24.915 --> 18:27.440
but unfortunately, I actually can.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.225
I know how you must
feel about Junior, but

18:30.268 --> 18:33.446
Magnum's instincts about this
sort of thing are really good.

18:33.489 --> 18:35.056
You should trust him.

18:47.723 --> 18:49.768
I hope your friends are good

18:49.812 --> 18:52.466
because you have very little time left.

19:14.706 --> 19:16.403
You guys better duck.

19:21.234 --> 19:23.889
Looks like some Fed types
paid your client a visit.

19:23.933 --> 19:25.456
It's got to be the CIA.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.676
You guys were right.
They are looking for the list.

19:27.719 --> 19:30.113
Okay, TC, take us around the corner.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.481
Mr. Magnum?

19:50.524 --> 19:52.744
Hey, can we come in, please?

20:02.145 --> 20:04.657
What are you all doing here?

20:04.700 --> 20:06.676
We actually don't have time
to explain, but we need

20:06.719 --> 20:08.978
to look through your husband's
laptop. It's very urgent.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.589
You know, the CIA was just here, too,

20:11.633 --> 20:13.330
and they didn't have time
to explain either.

20:13.373 --> 20:16.594
It would be nice if someone
gave me some answers because

20:16.638 --> 20:18.901
all I know is-is that I hired you to see

20:18.944 --> 20:21.643
if Daniel was having an affair,
now he's dead,

20:21.686 --> 20:23.775
but apparently before that

20:23.819 --> 20:25.690
he was involved
with some dangerous people.

20:25.734 --> 20:28.171
So can someone please
tell me what is going on.

20:28.214 --> 20:29.389
Okay.

20:29.433 --> 20:31.827
Those people that Daniel
was involved with,

20:31.870 --> 20:33.683
we think they're
a national security threat.

20:33.727 --> 20:35.265
We know you want answers, Erin,

20:35.308 --> 20:37.093
and we promise
we're gonna get them for you,

20:37.136 --> 20:39.486
but right now we have
other things to deal with.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.966
People's lives are on the line.

20:41.010 --> 20:43.186
Including the life
of someone we work with.

20:47.016 --> 20:48.626
It's over here.

20:48.670 --> 20:50.672
Okay. Thank you.

20:54.676 --> 20:56.503
Do you mind?

20:56.547 --> 20:58.027
What's the plan now?

20:58.070 --> 21:00.203
I'm searching for any communications

21:00.246 --> 21:02.945
between Daniel and whoever might
have encrypted the SD card.

21:05.904 --> 21:07.297
Okay. And?

21:07.340 --> 21:08.907
Well, there's nothing yet.

21:08.951 --> 21:11.257
Has anyone else searched
through this laptop recently?

21:11.301 --> 21:12.998
Just Daniel and the CIA.

21:14.215 --> 21:15.231
Oh.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.743
And there was this I.T. person
who came by three days ago?

21:18.787 --> 21:21.457
Daniel said he was having
some computer issues,

21:21.500 --> 21:23.574
so a man came over to service it.

21:24.762 --> 21:27.025
And did he give you a name
or perhaps leave a card?

21:27.186 --> 21:29.319
No. Daniel took him back to his study

21:29.362 --> 21:31.315
where he usually works
and closed the door.

21:34.846 --> 21:36.326
Right.

21:36.369 --> 21:39.938
Um, do you mind giving me
your Wi-Fi password?

21:39.982 --> 21:41.200
- Sure.
- Thank you.

21:42.820 --> 21:45.692
Thank you. And might my associates and I

21:45.717 --> 21:47.039
have a few moments alone?

21:47.903 --> 21:49.774
- Sure.
- Thank you.

21:50.819 --> 21:51.907
What are you thinking?

21:51.950 --> 21:53.909
An I.T. man who makes house calls?

21:53.952 --> 21:56.259
That's pretty posh.
And two days before Daniel's

21:56.302 --> 21:57.913
supposed to hand off the SD card?

21:57.956 --> 21:59.558
It could've been the guy
who encrypted it for him.

21:59.602 --> 22:02.395
Right. I'm checking Erin's router logs
to see if that person

22:02.439 --> 22:04.615
logged into the Wi-Fi as a guest
like I just did.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.051
I'm hoping I can identify him

22:06.095 --> 22:07.836
using his device's MAC address.

22:08.649 --> 22:10.055
It's the media access control.

22:10.099 --> 22:11.672
It's a unique device identifier.

22:11.716 --> 22:13.097
Do you think you'll be able to do it?

22:13.141 --> 22:14.843
Well, there's no such thing
as a MAC address registry,

22:14.886 --> 22:16.366
but I'm gonna give it a go.

22:16.409 --> 22:17.846
I just need a little time.

22:17.889 --> 22:19.151
Well, we don't have much time.

22:19.195 --> 22:21.893
Okay, well, stop talking
to me and I can focus.

22:24.026 --> 22:26.419
Hey, is Tani gonna be okay?

22:26.463 --> 22:28.639
If this turns out in our favor, yeah.

22:30.206 --> 22:31.511
I take it she had something going

22:31.555 --> 22:32.730
with the guy that was grabbed?

22:32.774 --> 22:34.051
Something. It's still in the works.

22:34.094 --> 22:35.207
Oh.

22:35.712 --> 22:36.865
What about you?

22:36.908 --> 22:38.214
Oh, no. I don't date people I work with.

22:38.257 --> 22:41.010
Oh, you know what? Neither do I.

22:41.739 --> 22:43.915
You're not a cocktail waitress,
I'm not a cop.

22:43.959 --> 22:45.569
Maybe we can get a beer or something

22:45.612 --> 22:47.223
after this whole thing is done.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.791
Are you seriously hitting on me
in the middle of an abduction?

22:51.096 --> 22:52.667
I don't know how to answer that question.

22:52.711 --> 22:54.407
Take my suggestion: don't.

22:54.450 --> 22:58.887
'Cause your game,
or lack thereof, it can wait.

23:05.981 --> 23:07.765
Okay. I've-I've got him.

23:07.809 --> 23:10.855
Our I.T. guy/programmer is one Eli Sung.

23:10.899 --> 23:13.205
He's 33 years old,
he has a previous conviction

23:13.249 --> 23:15.425
for creating, using
and distributing ransomware.

23:15.468 --> 23:16.600
Fits the profile.

23:16.643 --> 23:17.993
Let's get him.

23:32.921 --> 23:35.097
Sit down.

23:40.174 --> 23:41.566
Where am I, the Batcave?

23:41.591 --> 23:42.679
Just shut up and listen.

23:42.704 --> 23:44.444
There is important data on this SD card,

23:44.469 --> 23:45.775
data that you encoded.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.932
Now you're gonna unlock it for us.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.067
Why would I?

23:49.111 --> 23:52.766
And am I supposed to be
intimidated by a wine cellar?

23:57.206 --> 23:58.555
You've got 11 digits,

23:58.598 --> 24:01.079
including the one between your legs.

24:02.137 --> 24:04.096
That's 11 chances to cooperate.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.574
You're bluffing.

24:05.617 --> 24:07.085
Am I?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.480
Gonna be pretty hard to do
what you do without fingers.

24:12.961 --> 24:15.049
All right, all right! I'll help.

24:15.093 --> 24:17.371
You're crazy.

24:24.407 --> 24:26.281
Were you aware that
you were encrypting intel

24:26.324 --> 24:27.586
for a Chinese spy?

24:27.630 --> 24:29.277
No, and I didn't want to know.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.375
I find it's best to have
as little info as possible.

24:31.418 --> 24:33.459
The less you know, the longer you live.

24:33.503 --> 24:35.244
I'm in.

24:36.288 --> 24:37.729
Okay.

24:37.773 --> 24:39.245
We have to warn them immediately.

24:39.289 --> 24:41.337
- Yeah, of course. I'm gonna handle it.
- All right. Let's just do it fast

24:41.380 --> 24:43.382
because we're running out of time.

24:43.426 --> 24:44.731
Hey.

24:46.168 --> 24:48.126
- What's happening?
- What did you do?

24:48.170 --> 24:49.954
The file's being deleted.

24:49.998 --> 24:52.261
- What?
- I can't stop it.

24:53.305 --> 24:54.567
It's gone.

24:56.874 --> 24:59.485
Do you know what you just did?

25:03.402 --> 25:05.013
Get her off of me!

25:05.056 --> 25:06.449
- Hey, hey. Tani, stop.
- You just killed him!

25:06.492 --> 25:07.841
You son of a bitch!

25:07.885 --> 25:09.234
You just killed him!

25:41.546 --> 25:44.288
You might as well put
a bullet in me right now.

25:44.331 --> 25:45.550
Because no matter what,

25:45.593 --> 25:47.730
Five-O will never gonna
give you that list.

25:47.781 --> 25:49.597
- We'll see.
- You don't get it.

25:49.641 --> 25:53.198
They're not gonna sacrifice
dozens of people to save one.

25:53.242 --> 25:54.362
Well,

25:54.406 --> 25:56.909
we wouldn't,
but Americans have a tendency

25:56.952 --> 25:59.564
to let their emotions
cloud their judgement.

25:59.607 --> 26:02.610
Yeah, well, it's not
gonna happen here. Okay?

26:02.654 --> 26:04.438
Maybe you're right.

26:04.849 --> 26:06.938
Guess we'll know in an hour.

26:14.579 --> 26:16.015
You have ten seconds

26:16.058 --> 26:17.973
to explain why you deleted
that list before I step aside

26:18.017 --> 26:19.366
and let her pummel your face.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.543
I had to. All right?
There's a digital footprint

26:21.586 --> 26:23.035
on the encryption that points
straight back to me,

26:23.078 --> 26:24.815
and I'm not going to jail for treason.

26:25.648 --> 26:26.987
We're running out of time.

26:29.942 --> 26:31.250
So what now?

26:35.077 --> 26:36.514
Thomas Magnum.

26:36.557 --> 26:38.914
I understand you're helping Five-O.

26:40.916 --> 26:42.433
And how would you know that?

26:42.476 --> 26:44.073
Do you have what I want

26:44.117 --> 26:45.392
or not?

26:50.354 --> 26:51.746
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.576
Then it doesn't matter how I know.

26:55.620 --> 27:00.538
What matters is that if I don't
get it, Junior Reigns is dead.

27:02.583 --> 27:04.715
I need to talk to Junior.

27:04.758 --> 27:05.891
No.

27:05.934 --> 27:08.154
I need proof of life or there's no deal.

27:14.074 --> 27:15.683
Hello?

27:16.160 --> 27:18.904
Give me a question to ask him.

27:18.947 --> 27:21.292
Okay. I need, I need something
only Junior would know.

27:21.336 --> 27:26.300
Um, the first night that we met,
we had a bite to eat together.

27:26.343 --> 27:27.675
It was just the two of us.

27:27.718 --> 27:30.175
Okay, the first night he and Tani met,

27:30.218 --> 27:31.758
where did they eat?

27:34.039 --> 27:35.736
Wailana Coffee House.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.825
Yeah.

27:37.869 --> 27:39.522
Okay.

27:39.566 --> 27:42.351
Is he in need of medical
attention? Is he okay?

27:42.395 --> 27:43.570
He's fine.

27:43.613 --> 27:45.715
We want the list in 50 minutes.

27:45.758 --> 27:47.448
We'll text you the location.

27:50.838 --> 27:52.753
Ugh. I didn't get him.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.712
Guys, we got to think of something fast.

27:59.281 --> 28:02.197
Well, they don't know
that we don't have the list.

28:02.241 --> 28:04.634
How long does it take
to unlock that thing

28:04.678 --> 28:05.940
with the encryption key?

28:05.984 --> 28:08.029
- 90 seconds.
- Okay, well, do it again.

28:08.073 --> 28:09.901
Well, there's nothing to encrypt.

28:09.944 --> 28:11.163
It-it doesn't matter. Just make sure

28:11.206 --> 28:13.034
you use the same code you used last time.

28:13.078 --> 28:15.471
Come on. Get to work.

28:16.908 --> 28:18.083
What's the plan?

28:18.126 --> 28:19.867
Well, they have
the encryption key, right?

28:19.911 --> 28:22.261
So, we just give them an SD card
that they can unlock.

28:22.304 --> 28:24.002
- A blank card?
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

28:24.045 --> 28:25.351
They won't know until they decrypt it.

28:25.394 --> 28:26.831
Which will give us 90
seconds to get to Junior

28:26.874 --> 28:28.006
before they realize it's a bluff.

28:28.049 --> 28:29.300
And he's got to be somewhere close.

28:29.343 --> 28:30.835
90 seconds isn't much time.

28:30.878 --> 28:32.924
It's not, but that's
the only option we have

28:32.967 --> 28:34.447
unless you guys have a better idea.

28:35.927 --> 28:37.402
No. Let's do it.

28:37.445 --> 28:38.664
I'll take Rick and TC.

28:38.707 --> 28:41.193
Okay. I'll go with you and Juliet.

28:44.414 --> 28:45.763
Higgins?

28:45.806 --> 28:47.626
Be right back.

28:50.202 --> 28:51.899
You gonna tell me what's going on?

28:51.924 --> 28:53.490
Why did the kidnappers call you?

28:53.515 --> 28:55.952
Why did they know that you were involved?

28:55.977 --> 28:57.979
I think that Erin Hong lied to us.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.428
What are you talking about?

28:59.453 --> 29:01.337
So the CIA would've had to go
online when they went

29:01.362 --> 29:02.842
to her house to look at Daniel's laptop

29:02.867 --> 29:04.042
when they were searching his cloud.

29:04.067 --> 29:05.851
- Yeah?
- So,

29:05.876 --> 29:08.139
these are the router logs
from Erin's Wi-Fi.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.079
There were no logins prior to our visit.

29:10.104 --> 29:11.584
Also, Daniel's laptop would have
been considered evidence

29:11.609 --> 29:13.002
in a treasonous crime.

29:13.027 --> 29:14.507
There's no way
they wouldn't have seized it.

29:14.532 --> 29:16.708
Whoever those men were, they weren't CIA.

29:16.733 --> 29:18.300
And if Erin lied to us about that,

29:18.325 --> 29:19.718
then it stands to reason...

29:19.743 --> 29:21.811
- She's wrapped up in this.
- And outside

29:21.836 --> 29:23.163
of Katsumoto and Kamekona,

29:23.188 --> 29:25.452
no one else knew
that we were helping Five-O.

29:25.477 --> 29:26.870
That's why I got the ransom call.

29:26.895 --> 29:29.028
They couldn't get a hold
of McGarrett or anybody else,

29:29.053 --> 29:31.142
so they called us because
they knew we were involved.

29:31.167 --> 29:33.169
And I would wager that she didn't hire us

29:33.194 --> 29:35.501
because she was worried about
her husband cheating on her.

29:35.526 --> 29:37.310
No, she just wanted to keep tabs on him.

29:37.816 --> 29:39.426
She was after that list
and wanted to know

29:39.451 --> 29:40.583
who he was meeting with.

29:40.608 --> 29:41.697
Right.

29:45.518 --> 29:47.172
Everything all right?

29:49.757 --> 29:51.367
Daiyu Mei doesn't have Junior.

29:51.392 --> 29:52.698
We had it all wrong.

29:52.723 --> 29:53.811
Well, then, who has him?

29:53.836 --> 29:55.751
Our client, Erin Hong.

29:58.703 --> 30:01.099
- We think she's a spy.
- And that she was trying to acquire

30:01.142 --> 30:03.405
the NOC list on behalf
of the Chinese government.

30:05.103 --> 30:07.018
How we doing?

30:07.061 --> 30:08.280
Almost there.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.198
It's done.

30:14.153 --> 30:16.068
You better pray this works.

30:16.093 --> 30:17.791
- It's not my plan.
- Move.

31:05.990 --> 31:07.252
Hand it over.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.212
We're only dealing with Erin.

31:11.645 --> 31:13.388
Don't know who that is.

31:13.432 --> 31:15.023
Then there's no deal.

31:25.235 --> 31:26.497
Wait.

31:32.296 --> 31:34.733
I'm gonna say Chinese MSS.

31:34.758 --> 31:35.976
High level.

31:36.001 --> 31:37.383
Most likely the handler
for all the assets

31:37.434 --> 31:38.783
and agents on the island.

31:41.286 --> 31:42.896
The list.

31:42.940 --> 31:45.203
I need to know where Junior's at first.

31:51.122 --> 31:52.384
He's in a white van

31:52.427 --> 31:54.070
parked on a service road

31:54.113 --> 31:55.784
two miles east of here.

31:55.828 --> 31:57.027
I can get there in three minutes.

31:57.070 --> 31:59.347
We have 90 seconds
once they hand over the SD card.

32:03.134 --> 32:05.049
Give me the list.

32:07.355 --> 32:09.836
I kept my end of the deal.

32:16.451 --> 32:17.988
Thank you.

32:18.031 --> 32:19.324
You know, we're still gonna
have to get paid

32:19.367 --> 32:20.978
for following your husband around.

32:22.762 --> 32:24.155
Hold it!

32:32.250 --> 32:35.035
- We had a deal.
- After being a spy

32:35.079 --> 32:37.342
for ten years,
I've developed trust issues.

32:37.385 --> 32:39.234
I want to verify the list
is actually on here

32:39.278 --> 32:41.172
before I allow you to leave.

32:50.073 --> 32:51.335
There it is.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.157
He's not here!

33:10.201 --> 33:12.029
I repeat, Junior's not in the van!

33:43.844 --> 33:45.131
You know what

33:46.550 --> 33:48.501
You don't have to do that.

33:48.969 --> 33:50.590
Excuse me?

33:50.633 --> 33:52.592
There's nothing on there.

33:52.635 --> 33:53.767
Magnum, what are you doing?

33:53.810 --> 33:55.203
Look, we know

33:55.246 --> 33:56.813
Junior's not in the van.

33:56.857 --> 33:58.598
And spoiler alert:

33:58.641 --> 34:00.643
there's nothing on that SD card.

34:00.687 --> 34:02.558
Clearly, we have some trust issues.

34:02.602 --> 34:04.821
So... I'm thinking,
why don't we just start out

34:04.865 --> 34:06.152
from the beginning...

34:09.870 --> 34:11.088
Where is he?

35:02.879 --> 35:03.924
Joons!

35:06.840 --> 35:08.058
Hey. Hey, Joons.

35:08.102 --> 35:11.801
Hey. Tani. Hey! Hey.

35:11.845 --> 35:13.847
Hey, hey. Let me get those off.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.851
Hey. Hey, hey.

35:22.943 --> 35:24.901
It's okay.

35:24.945 --> 35:26.947
It's okay.

35:28.688 --> 35:30.385
I'm okay.

35:31.473 --> 35:32.605
I'm okay.

35:35.477 --> 35:37.000
I'm okay, I'm okay.

35:37.784 --> 35:39.786
