00:08.530 --> 00:09.966
HICKS:
Sergeants Harrelson
and Becker.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.098
You remember Lieutenant
Detective Lynch

00:11.141 --> 00:12.577
from the mayor's office?Sure.

00:12.621 --> 00:15.276
Hello, ma'am.Nice to see you
again, Lieutenant.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.321
Sergeants.It seems that SWAT has
piqued the interest

00:17.365 --> 00:19.367
of some of the powers
that be in the city,

00:19.410 --> 00:21.934
and they want
Lieutenant Detective Lynch here

00:21.978 --> 00:24.372
for the day to, um--
how'd the memo put it?

00:24.415 --> 00:25.808
Conduct a departmental review.

00:25.851 --> 00:28.289
Past few days, I've been
reading your strike reports

00:28.332 --> 00:31.509
and personnel files
in the city archives.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.511
Boy, that was a test
of my dust allergy.

00:33.555 --> 00:36.514
And no question, SWAT deserves
its rep as the best.

00:36.558 --> 00:39.735
It's an expectation we welcome.Now I'm ready for
some firsthand

00:39.778 --> 00:42.346
observation and conversation
with boots on the ground.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.565
Shall we start with you?

00:43.608 --> 00:46.089
Yes, ma'am.You can use the office

00:46.133 --> 00:47.438
across the hall.Thanks, Commander.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.313
Here to observe?

00:52.356 --> 00:54.532
What do you think she
and the mayor are really up to?

00:54.576 --> 00:56.491
Well, three decades
of policing tells me

00:56.534 --> 00:58.841
it's not to
conduct a review.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.583
Maybe we're both
just too cynical.

01:01.626 --> 01:04.325
You know, it makes sense
to me now why city hall's

01:04.368 --> 01:07.371
been stonewalling me on hiring
a new captain to replace Cortez.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.591
CEOs don't get
to pick new VPs

01:09.634 --> 01:12.072
when a company's about
to get taken over.

01:13.247 --> 01:15.901
Lynch is here to
take inventory.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.339
You think city hall
has new plans for SWAT?

01:18.382 --> 01:20.123
Like what?

01:20.167 --> 01:22.256
Exactly.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.785
This one is a chile relleno.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.830
It's a bell pepper stuffed
with veggies and meat,

01:31.874 --> 01:33.832
dipped in, uh... butter?

01:33.876 --> 01:35.791
Egg batter.Egg batter. Right.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.271
And then you fry it,
and you want

01:37.314 --> 01:39.360
to wash it down with tepache.
Taste this, Deac.

01:39.403 --> 01:41.101
It's pineapple.

01:41.144 --> 01:44.278
It's tangy, but it's
not sweet. It's good.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.410
Top it off with, uh--
what do you call these, uh,

01:46.454 --> 01:48.499
doughnut ball things again?Buñuelitos.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.327
Buñuritos.Buñuelitos.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.328
Buñueliri... bun...

01:51.372 --> 01:52.895
Yeah. Yeah.Xiomara,

01:52.938 --> 01:54.157
this food is amazing.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.419
You know, if I knew
that Luca lived

01:55.463 --> 01:56.899
two doors down
from a five-star chef,

01:56.942 --> 01:58.466
I would've moved in
a long time ago.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.946
Check it out.Mmm, mmm. You realize
this smell's toying

02:00.990 --> 02:02.600
with a bunch of hungry
SWAT officers out there?

02:02.644 --> 02:04.211
Think they're getting
ready to breach.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.300
Now, imagine
these culinary treats

02:06.343 --> 02:08.519
could come to you
wherever you are

02:08.563 --> 02:09.520
any day of the week.

02:09.564 --> 02:10.347
Like a delivery service?Better.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.132
Food truck, all right?

02:12.175 --> 02:13.481
It's a prospectus
I drew up.

02:13.524 --> 02:16.048
All the facts and figures
laid out right in here.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.616
What it would take for us
to start our own operation.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.357
Guatemalan food is the
only cuisine around

02:20.401 --> 02:22.490
that's sweet, spicy and savory
all in the same dish.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.013
And with the way
Xiomara cooks, man,

02:24.056 --> 02:25.362
there's nothing like it
out there.

02:25.406 --> 02:26.537
Trust me.TAN:
I know you know

02:26.581 --> 02:28.452
your food trucks.Start-up costs run

02:28.496 --> 02:29.975
60 grand--
that's for a truck,

02:30.019 --> 02:31.499
equipment, supplies.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.065
I can front 35 grand.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.416
If you four and Hondo
throw in five each,

02:35.459 --> 02:37.200
this could be a team investment.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.419
I mean, look,
we already put together

02:38.462 --> 02:39.768
a menu, man--
it's awesome.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.205
Xiomara, how do you feel
about taking on

02:42.249 --> 02:44.729
the foodie capital of the world?He say so.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.818
Look, I know I'm springing this
on you guys out of the blue,

02:46.862 --> 02:49.343
but just look it over, check
it out, tell me what you think.

02:49.386 --> 02:52.041
I mean, this could be
the next big thing, man.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.085
[chuckles weakly]

02:59.048 --> 03:01.355
MAN [over P.A.]:
Transfer van is here.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.965
Please have all
transfer patients

03:03.008 --> 03:05.185

03:06.534 --> 03:08.449
[woman laughs softly]

03:08.492 --> 03:10.625
You're so silly.

03:10.668 --> 03:13.323
Look at her flirt.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.195
Who do you think
she's talking to?

03:15.238 --> 03:16.326
Probably a boyfriend.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.459
Probably. I mean,
she's really pretty.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.938
I like her, uh,

03:19.982 --> 03:21.679
lipstick.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.726
I can get it for you.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.556

If you do me a favor.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.647
Oh. You took
your medication, Bernice.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.301
No. I need to use the toilet.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.519
Rec time's almost over.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.129
Can you hold it
till the orderlies are back

03:37.173 --> 03:38.609
to get everyone
to their rooms?

03:40.263 --> 03:41.569
Call you later, babe.

Okay.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.540
Roll down your sleeves.

with the dress code here.

All right, remember,

04:55.512 --> 04:57.079
these people
are not in their right mind.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.820
Unless a life is
in immediate danger,

04:58.863 --> 05:00.952
we go with nonlethal force
the whole way today.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.477

in there is safely restrained.

Bernice, hey.

Absolutely. Now, put

Someone in Beverly Hills

06:38.746 --> 06:41.401
Now, just turn around, okay?Especially when I'm dead.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.315
How about you just place
your hands on the wall?

Ah-ha-ha-ha.
Not even a little funny.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.424
Hey, Street, you
know we got to pay

07:04.467 --> 07:06.121
for our own dry
cleaning, right?
Yes!

07:06.164 --> 07:07.209
DEACON:
Hondo.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.776
Found that missing guard.

How'd all this
get started?

07:13.128 --> 07:15.478
The new custodian.
I-I don't know his name.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.611
He smuggled in weapons,
got 'em all riled up.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.656
Then he ran off
with Ruth Pearson.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.268
Ruth Pearson's a patient here?

07:23.312 --> 07:24.444
For the past
nine years, yeah.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.445
Who's Ruth Pearson?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.317
Wayne Pearson's widow.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.667
They ran a cult together
from a compound

07:30.711 --> 07:32.713
in Laurel Canyon
years ago.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.802
The one that planned that
mass suicide, Virgo's Temple?

07:34.845 --> 07:36.630
This is that
cult leader's wife?

07:36.673 --> 07:38.675
Ruth was as much the leader
as her husband was,

07:38.719 --> 07:40.155
only Wayne died that day
and she didn't.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.549
A lot of people got hurt
because of what this couple did,

07:42.592 --> 07:44.246
and no one was ever
really held accountable.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.377
What about Ruth?

07:45.421 --> 07:46.814
D.A. didn't throw
the book at her?

07:46.857 --> 07:48.903
He tried, but it
didn't go anywhere.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.948
She's legally insane.

♪

08:30.031 --> 08:31.336
CHRIS:
Who we dealing with?

08:31.380 --> 08:32.599
So, Ruth Pearson and her husband

08:32.642 --> 08:34.209
founded Virgo's Temple
in the early '90s,

08:34.252 --> 08:37.212
but by '99, it had turned into
a full-blown doomsday cult.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.519
LUCA: When the world didn't end
with Y2K, Wayne just pushed

08:39.562 --> 08:40.520
the apocalypse back.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.173
After a while, Ruth said

08:42.217 --> 08:44.611

08:44.654 --> 08:46.308
Mass suicide?Wayne and a
few higher-ups

08:46.351 --> 08:49.006

08:49.050 --> 08:51.356
everyone else in that compound
while under fire.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.358
After all these years,
Ruth's bound to be vindictive.

With the help
of the janitor

08:55.317 --> 08:56.536

09:02.542 --> 09:05.370

juvenile records and got a hit.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.720
That employee is Ruth's son.

All three of those guys are.

Auto theft,
armed robbery, assault.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.776
Ruth Pearson is
a high-profile fugitive.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.952
Her escape will draw plenty
of public interest.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.999
Especially now that we know
it's a family reunion.Might be your chance

09:25.042 --> 09:27.175
for a do-over with
the Virgo's Temple, Sergeant.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.439
HICKS: The Pearson family
used to have dozens of followers

09:30.482 --> 09:32.223
who were willing
to drink the Kool-Aid.

Sir, we're gonna need access
to Ruth's patient file

fake name, fake address,

10:06.910 --> 10:08.869
fake references.You can fake an ID,

but you can't fake
a social security number.

10:11.262 --> 10:14.178
Find his W-9, see what
you can get back on it.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.440
Hey, Deac.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.442
Lynch told Hondo
this is his chance

10:17.486 --> 10:19.401
for a do-over
with Virgo's Temple.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.663
What's that
supposed to mean?

10:20.707 --> 10:22.230
It sounded like a dig to me.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.406
Was Hondo part of the raid
that took out the Temple

10:24.449 --> 10:25.625
nine years ago?

10:25.668 --> 10:27.191
Yeah. We both were.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.585
You saw it all go down?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.195
Yeah. Saw the
aftermath.

10:31.239 --> 10:32.849
Wayne and a few
of his lackeys,

10:32.893 --> 10:34.982
they were DOA before
we got there, but...

10:35.025 --> 10:36.766
we saved the rest.
CHRIS:
Do you remember seeing

10:36.810 --> 10:38.681
Ruth or the boys?Not sure. It was...

10:38.725 --> 10:39.682
surreal.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.249
The adults were armed.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.425
The kids were all upstairs
huddled four to a bed.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.688
So what do you think Lynch meant
by Hondo getting a do-over?

10:45.732 --> 10:48.256
You'll have to ask her.

10:48.299 --> 10:51.476
Commander Hicks,
meet Leo Moretti.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.783
Leo is a private investigator
who helped me resolve

10:53.827 --> 10:55.829
a parental kidnapping case
a few years back.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.308
This is his
client, Pam.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.614
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.964
How can we help?

11:01.008 --> 11:03.488
The people you're looking for,
the Pearsons,

11:03.532 --> 11:06.709
my daughter's with them,
being held against her will.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.232
Did you report her abduction
to the police?

11:08.276 --> 11:09.625
MORETTI: She wasn't
abducted, Commander.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.367
Pam hasn't seen her
daughter in four years.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.890
Why do you think
she's with them?

11:13.934 --> 11:15.022
Found it in her room.

11:15.065 --> 11:18.025
Clare never really had friends,

11:18.068 --> 11:20.331
and I worked nights
after the divorce.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.639
So Fiona was a godsend,
at first.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.119
One night, I found

11:25.162 --> 11:27.469
Wayne Pearson's book
in Clare's room.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.732
Letters were tucked
inside between

11:29.776 --> 11:31.734
the girls and the Pearson boys.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.171
How they were all gonna
live together on a commune,

11:34.215 --> 11:36.173
h-how the world
was gonna end.

11:36.217 --> 11:39.002
They even got matching
star tattoos on their wrists.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.961
So I told Clare
that she couldn't

11:41.004 --> 11:43.267
see Fiona or the
Pearson boys anymore.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.487
She stormed out.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.489
That was the last time
I saw her.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.012
Commune? Intel said

11:49.056 --> 11:50.274
the Temple disbanded
nine years ago.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.362
You're saying
they're still active?

11:51.406 --> 11:52.929
We don't think
they ever weren't.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.757
Numbers aren't what
they used to be,

11:54.801 --> 11:57.238
but I believe there's still
a handful of devoted followers.

11:57.281 --> 11:58.369
From what I've found,

11:58.413 --> 12:00.328
some ex-members
have moved out of state,

12:00.371 --> 12:03.331
but more recently,
they've changed their names

12:03.374 --> 12:05.333
and they've trickled back
into the area.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.291
Mind sharing what you've been
able to collect with us?

12:07.335 --> 12:09.511
Whatever it takes
to get Clare home.Oh, good.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.991
There's one more thing,
Commander.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.342
Two months ago, Clare called me.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.867
First time in four years.
She said she was pregnant.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.826
She needed money.
She wanted to escape

12:19.869 --> 12:22.698
from them, that the-the boys
had terrible things planned.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.700
And then there
was screaming,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.963
and the line went dead.

12:27.007 --> 12:31.533
Clare is alive and wants out.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.230
Would you excuse me a second?

12:35.493 --> 12:38.148
The Social Security number
used by Ruth's son,

12:38.192 --> 12:39.541
issued to a Dylan Wheady,

12:39.584 --> 12:41.195
and he's on our list
of Temple members.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.371
Social was never
reported stolen?
No.

12:43.414 --> 12:44.633
Well, this guy's
probably in on it.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.243
Maybe he's sheltering
the whole Pearson clan.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.376
The registered address is a
ranch house up in the foothills.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.551
Good Shepherd Road.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.205
Well, go get 'em.All right.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.598
HONDO:
Street and Tan,
three-side with me.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.905
Deac and Chris,
you've got the one.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.935
[floor creaks]

13:34.074 --> 13:36.032
[screams]
LAPD!

13:36.076 --> 13:38.730
You're police.
Oh, it's the police. Thank God.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.123
What's your name?
Nicole.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.951
I'm Nicole.Where's Dylan Wheady?

13:41.995 --> 13:44.127
Dylan, you can come out.
It's safe.Turn around, turn around.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.694
What?

13:48.218 --> 13:51.004
Turn around.[panting]

13:51.047 --> 13:52.309
We thought you were them.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.572
Thought we were who?The Pearsons.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.444
We heard about Ruth's escape.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.446
Josh and Jasmine split.
We didn't know what else to do.

13:58.489 --> 14:01.144
Josh and Jasmine?Josh and I escaped
from the Temple together.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.885
Ruth was always so tough on him.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.539
He wasn't about to wait around
and let her hurt Jasmine.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.323
NICOLE: Yeah, they left
about an hour ago.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.542
Why was one
of the brothers

14:07.585 --> 14:09.239
using your
Social Security number?

14:09.283 --> 14:11.198
I had to leave everything
behind; my friends, my car,

14:11.241 --> 14:13.243
my Social Security card.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.898
You have to file for a
new address to report it stolen.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.552
I was afraid it was
gonna make it easier

14:17.595 --> 14:19.206
for them to track me down.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.208
Did you hear any chatter about
what they might have planned?

14:21.251 --> 14:23.253
I check a few online forums
once in a while,

14:23.297 --> 14:25.516
in case some cult-obsessed troll
targets Dylan.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.344
Posts on there have been
picking up lately.

14:27.388 --> 14:28.693
DYLAN: I guess
that makes sense.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.521
Ruth escaping the same week
as the Draconids.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.393
Same week as what?

14:32.436 --> 14:35.483
The Draconid meteor shower.
It's Temple dogma.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.877
Meteors clear the sky for
a ship to arrive from Andromeda.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.879
They're the ones that are
supposed to take the souls

14:39.922 --> 14:41.141
to the higher level planet.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.796
It all sounds so stupid now.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.798
Hondo, we got a male
and female here.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.322
They say they're hiding
from the Pearson family,

14:48.365 --> 14:49.366
and there's another couple
in the wind.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.628
HONDO:
Okay, let's bring 'em in.

14:50.672 --> 14:53.370
Rest of the property is clear.Roger that.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.329
Hey, guys, mug shots
we blasted out just got a hit.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.157
A man matching
Theo Pearson's description

14:57.200 --> 15:00.203
was just seen at a truck depot
on Commerce Boulevard.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.944
HONDO: Sending Street and Tan
to check it out.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.425
The rest of us are on our way
back to HQ with two guests.

15:04.468 --> 15:05.426
Okay, roger that.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.776
TAN:
I took a look at

15:07.819 --> 15:09.386
Luca's prospectus.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.388
That thing goes deep,
you put in work.
Yeah.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.477
Hey, what's got him so revved up
about this food truck?

15:13.521 --> 15:15.392
At first, I thought
it was just Luca being Luca,

15:15.436 --> 15:17.351
trying to help out a neighbor,
but I don't know, man,

15:17.394 --> 15:18.787
it seems like she's
just along for the ride.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.267
This is all Luca's baby.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.399
She's a hell of a cook, though.
You gonna throw in?

15:22.443 --> 15:24.184
I would, but I'm trying
to save up.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.620
Yeah, same.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.404
Hoping to do some
traveling next year.Oh, yeah?

15:27.448 --> 15:28.884
Yeah. It's kind of crazy

15:28.928 --> 15:30.538
there aren't more Guatemalan
food trucks around.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.454
That our guy?
26-David.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.151
Eyes on Theo Pearson
at the depot.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.939
[siren wailing]

15:39.982 --> 15:42.245
Police! Don't move!

15:42.289 --> 15:43.725
STREET: Step out from
behind the vehicle

15:43.768 --> 15:44.987
with your hands on your head.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.946
Walk slowly backwards to me.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.299
Shots fired.
1942 Commerce Boulevard.

15:52.342 --> 15:54.127
Repeat. Shots fired.

15:55.693 --> 15:58.479
TAN: Two, two, two.Go, go, go, go, go.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.748
[grunts]

16:13.276 --> 16:16.018
Nowhere to go. Give it up.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.955
Drop the gun!

16:39.999 --> 16:42.523
I'll be waiting for them.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.264
Don't do that!

16:46.614 --> 16:49.051
[shouting][gunshots]

16:53.403 --> 16:54.404
Who the hell are these people?

16:58.930 --> 17:02.064
Self-immolation as an act
of protest is desperate.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.632
Burning yourself alive
as the result of delusion speaks

17:04.675 --> 17:06.634
to something
far more disturbing.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.157
Like being raised
in a cult.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.898
Or having two nutcase parents.

17:09.941 --> 17:11.378
In the Pearsons' case, I'd say

17:11.421 --> 17:13.597
both nurture and nature
are equal to blame.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.773
Here's Mom's sanity hearing.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.906
Ancient Mayans said the path

17:17.949 --> 17:21.040
to the afterlife
was more painful than anything.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.217
No one reaches Andromeda
without sacrifice.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.915
But when we arrive,

17:26.958 --> 17:29.657
all that pain...

17:29.700 --> 17:32.094
it makes us gods.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.098
And our time is at hand.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.449
The convoy is coming.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.408
She's Machiavellian,
narcissistic,

17:41.451 --> 17:44.715
and a diagnosed psychopath-- all
three traits of the dark triad.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.239
LYNCH:
Manipulative,

17:46.282 --> 17:47.675
violent, and a god complex?

17:47.718 --> 17:49.242
That's a hell of a cocktail.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.331
Patients like this
are unpredictable

17:51.374 --> 17:52.549
in a clinical setting.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.464
In the real world,
watch out.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.987
Any idea what Ruth
might be planning next?

17:56.031 --> 17:57.380
Well, the boyfriend
and girlfriend

17:57.424 --> 17:59.295
we brought in aren't sure,
but timing her escape

17:59.339 --> 18:01.254
to coincide with this Draconid
meteor shower or whatever...

18:01.297 --> 18:02.603
She's setting up
another doomsday,

18:02.646 --> 18:04.126
and given her track record,

18:04.170 --> 18:06.737
her true believers are
a body count waiting to happen.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.264
Lieutenant, thank
whoever you know

18:11.307 --> 18:13.004
who's on the sanity
review board.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.963
Usually, it takes weeks
to pull these hearings.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.661
I don't believe in red tape.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.275
Hondo.
Hey, kid.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.364
Any luck tracking that missing
couple from the farmhouse?

18:24.407 --> 18:26.235
Uh, not yet. No
cell phone traces,

18:26.279 --> 18:27.541
credit card hits, nothing.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.586
Just keep looking, then.Okay.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.546
Hey, uh,
can I ask you something?

18:32.589 --> 18:35.157
Yeah. Go ahead, shoot.

18:35.201 --> 18:39.683
Lynch... she said that today
was your chance for a do-over?

18:41.337 --> 18:44.514
Yeah, all right.

18:44.558 --> 18:48.301
Look, kid, when we hit that
compound nine years ago,

18:48.344 --> 18:51.260
I put myself in a
vulnerable position,

18:51.304 --> 18:54.045
so Bucky wrote me up.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.178
My only violation
on my SWAT record.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.658
I'm sure Buck was trying
to teach you a lesson.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.486
No. No, I deserved it.

18:59.529 --> 19:03.316
I got locked in a standoff with
one of the Temple followers.

19:03.359 --> 19:07.189
Neither one of us wanted
to lower our guns...

19:07.233 --> 19:09.235
but I could see that
the guy was just scared.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.628
So I thought the only
way he was gonna make it

19:11.672 --> 19:14.414
out of there alive was if I
could earn his trust somehow.

19:14.457 --> 19:17.243
You lowered your weapon first?No. No, I did not,
but I didn't

19:17.286 --> 19:20.246
take the shot when I could
have and when I should have.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.944
I leaned too much
on my gut, Street.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.251
And since then, I've
seen that go way wrong

19:25.294 --> 19:26.687
for cops more than once.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.428
That's why we work
the way that we do.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.386
We rely on our training
in the moment.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.128
It's a lesson every
officer learns.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.565
We got to be good, but
we got to be lucky, too.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.741
But how does Lynch
even know about this?

19:37.785 --> 19:39.787
She must have done
her homework.I mean, is she, like,

19:39.830 --> 19:41.484
digging into
our personnel files?

19:41.528 --> 19:44.226
How and why?I got no idea.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.924
What I did that day
wasn't very smart.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.231
But, man, you know, the-the kid
just seemed like a lost soul

19:49.275 --> 19:51.407
more than any type of
threat to me at the time.

19:51.451 --> 19:54.149
His name's Kai.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.673
And believe it or not,
these past few years,

19:56.717 --> 19:58.414
he's gone and turned
his life around.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.460
He opened a place to
help people who flee

20:00.503 --> 20:02.592
or get spit out by groups
like the Temple. Go figure.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.159
Wow.
Yeah.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.249
You think maybe he can
help us out with this?

20:07.293 --> 20:09.773
I'm about to
go find out.
All right.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.821
Tamalitos?

20:13.864 --> 20:16.040
Uh, no, thank you.
I shouldn't.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.217
Speak for yourself.
I'll have two chuchitos to go

20:18.260 --> 20:20.262
and some hot sauce,
too, please. Thank you.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.742
What's up, bro?

20:21.785 --> 20:25.006
Listen, um... I can't invest
in the food truck right now.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.399
It's just not a good time.
I'm sorry.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.575
I shouldn't have put you
on the spot, man, I mean,

20:28.618 --> 20:31.752
just knowing you got back on
solid ground financially.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.275
So I gave it
some thought.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.495
There's no point
doing all this work

20:35.538 --> 20:38.193
to get the truck up and running
if the team can't be part of it.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.543
I want to spot you
the five grand.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.415
Okay, you just pay me
back whenever you can.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.373
It's okay, man.No. That is
unbelievably generous.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.593
I-I can't accept that. I don't
want to owe you any money.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.421
I don't want
to owe anybody money.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.510
And-and as soon as I do
get some money to invest,

20:50.553 --> 20:52.251
I want to invest it
in something simple

20:52.294 --> 20:53.948
and-and boring,
like a-a mutual fund.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.602
Yeah, but you tasted
this food, right?

20:55.645 --> 20:57.299
I mean, this stuff is
just gonna sell itself.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.649
It is fantastic, it is.
It... I'm sorry.

20:59.693 --> 21:02.173
Okay, I understand.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.871
CHRIS:
I can't swing it
either, Luca.

21:03.914 --> 21:05.829
I've been trying
to put money away,

21:05.873 --> 21:08.092
and I know Tan and Street
are in the same boat,

21:08.136 --> 21:10.051
probably waiting
for the right time to tell you.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.096
But, you know, I don't know
if Hondo's taken a look
at the prospectus.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.098
Yeah. No. I mean, Hondo's
got responsibilities.

21:14.142 --> 21:17.319
You all do. I-I get it.
Totally get it. It's cool.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.321
I swear, if I had
the money to burn...Don't-don't worry about it.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.496
It's good. It's good.

21:20.540 --> 21:21.497
I'm all right.
All right.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.499
[grunts]

21:30.376 --> 21:34.336
Hi. Hey, I... I should have
talked it over with them

21:34.380 --> 21:35.946
before roping
you in. I'm sorry.

21:35.990 --> 21:39.472
This was supposed to be
something for my whole team.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.648
I-I mean, something
for you, obviously,

21:41.691 --> 21:43.519
and something
for me, too.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.652
I've never been in charge
of my own thing before,

21:45.695 --> 21:48.350
and I thought...

21:48.394 --> 21:51.179
Look, I-I didn't go
to business school or anything,

21:51.222 --> 21:53.790
but I know I could've
pulled this off.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.358
I kn-- I know it, man.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.968
I'll think of some
other way. Don't worry.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.579
Hmm?

22:00.623 --> 22:03.017
Thanks for the talk.
All right.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.497
Mmm.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.586
[chuckles]:
Man, that's... so good.

22:20.687 --> 22:23.211
Hondo?

22:23.254 --> 22:24.995
Hey.
Hey.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.041
Good to see you, Kai.You, too.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.435
I assume you saw the news
of Ruth Pearson's escape

22:29.478 --> 22:31.698
and what happened to Theo?Burning himself alive?

22:31.741 --> 22:34.831
It's awful.
Can't say I'm surprised.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.486
Well, I guess the crazy bar
for this cult

22:37.530 --> 22:38.792
is on a whole nother level.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.446
The Temple sales pitch
was simple.

22:40.489 --> 22:43.666
You know, they'd help you reach
consciousness above human.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.451
And at times, it felt real.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.453
You know, growing vegetables,
raising animals.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.280
We sang a lot.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.021
I did everything
that Wayne and Ruth said,

22:51.065 --> 22:55.591
hoping for enlightenment,
but, uh, it's all a lie.

22:55.635 --> 22:56.897
That must've been
a tough realization.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.551
It wasn't until I was
old enough to process

22:58.594 --> 23:00.901
their most demented views
that I questioned things.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.816
How Ruth said that burning alive
was the cleanest way

23:02.859 --> 23:05.732
for the soul to ascend,
or that suicide

23:05.775 --> 23:08.125
was the only way
to reach perfection.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.563
When the Pearsons
planned this doomsday,

23:10.606 --> 23:13.261
what do you remember in
the lead-up to that afternoon?

23:15.306 --> 23:18.397
Well, Wayne said
the ship would come for us.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.616
The sky would finally
be clear enough

23:20.660 --> 23:22.662
for the journey.

23:24.794 --> 23:29.582
Then the day came,
and we were all ready to ascend.

23:31.671 --> 23:34.195
Wayne and his men
started handing out pills

23:34.238 --> 23:35.457
and telling the kids

23:35.501 --> 23:36.719
they were vitamins.And then we showed up

23:36.763 --> 23:38.721
and all hell broke loose.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.245
I wasn't
in my right mind, Hondo.

23:41.289 --> 23:43.639
I hope you know that.I do know that, Kai.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.598
I could see that you didn't
want to shoot me.

23:45.641 --> 23:46.990
The Pearsons may
have linked up

23:47.034 --> 23:48.731
with a handful of
Temple members.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.254
Now, with the meteor showers
coming this week,

23:50.298 --> 23:52.474
Ruth seems to think
that some type of convoy

23:52.518 --> 23:53.475
is coming for them.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.737
She's planning
something big.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.304
Does that mean anything to you?

23:56.347 --> 23:57.740
She used that word, "convoy"?

23:57.784 --> 23:59.481
Yes.That's Temple lingo.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.658
Means 36--
Ruth and 35 followers.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.181
They're the convoy.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.880
You think Ruth has
35 other people

24:06.923 --> 24:09.665
willing to take their own lives?

24:09.709 --> 24:11.362
LUCA:
23 ex-members unaccounted for.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.582
None of 'em have been seen
at their home or their jobs

24:13.626 --> 24:15.105
the past two weeks.
They just vanished.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.629
All right, with the five
rumored new recruits

24:16.672 --> 24:18.674
we got from the P.I.,
that makes 28.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.502
You add Ruth
and her two surviving sons...

24:20.546 --> 24:21.677
Still only gives them

24:21.721 --> 24:23.418
31 members, tops.Yeah, and they need

24:23.462 --> 24:25.289
36 for this ritual.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.509
She needs more bodies.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.076
PAM:
My daughter called.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.557
She broke free
from the Pearsons.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.123
Sh-She escaped.Where is she?

24:33.167 --> 24:36.605
I recorded the call.
Here, listen.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.433
CLARE: Mom, I got away.PAM: You okay?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.913
CLARE:
Ruth's getting them ready.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.610
Come get me, please.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.655
PAM:
Where are you?

24:42.698 --> 24:43.699
CLARE:
I came to Grandma's place,

24:43.743 --> 24:45.179
but she's not there.

24:45.222 --> 24:48.182
If they find me, my baby...

24:48.225 --> 24:50.184
I'm scared, Mom.

24:50.227 --> 24:53.666
PAM:
Clare? Hello? Hello?

24:53.709 --> 24:55.711
My-my mother's been
in a nursing home.

24:55.755 --> 24:57.104
We're selling her house,

24:57.147 --> 24:58.801
but I just-- I haven't had time
to pack it up.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.412
Clare doesn't know any of this.
I'll go with you.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.066
No, ma'am, I'm sorry,
that is not an option.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.590
You can follow us and
hang by the perimeter.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.113
Uh...

25:06.156 --> 25:08.463
W-Wait.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.903
Bring my baby home safe.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.653
DEACON:
LAPD!

25:24.697 --> 25:26.829
Clare, are you here?LAPD!

25:26.873 --> 25:27.961
CHRIS:
Deac.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.315
Main room clear.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.363
Cops are here, Clare.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.061
24-David, I need an R/A.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.149
Pregnant female,
pair of lacerations

25:42.192 --> 25:43.759
to the head and torso.

25:43.803 --> 25:45.500
I'll grab a medkit. You good?I got her. Go.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.503
Hey.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.635
Stay with us.[grunts]

25:53.290 --> 25:54.596
Hey, Moretti,
I thought you said Clare

25:54.640 --> 25:56.424
had a star tattoo
on her wrist.

25:56.467 --> 25:57.512
MORETTI:
Yeah, a star on her left wrist.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.081
[both grunting]

26:04.519 --> 26:06.739
She's got explosives!

26:07.740 --> 26:10.351
Drop the trigger!

26:10.394 --> 26:11.831
[grunting]

26:15.008 --> 26:16.792
Get off-- Get off me, bitch!

26:17.967 --> 26:19.578
[panting]

26:19.621 --> 26:20.622
DEACON:
Roll bomb squad to
the location now!

26:20.666 --> 26:22.624
Chris, you good?

26:22.668 --> 26:24.060
This isn't Clare.

26:24.104 --> 26:25.453
They used her
to lure us in.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.977
They wanted to distract us.

26:33.853 --> 26:36.420
Who is it?RUTH:
Your mother.

26:41.425 --> 26:42.731
Ruth?

26:42.775 --> 26:44.777
Do what you want with me.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.953
But just let Jasmine go.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.084
She's innocent.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.568
We are all innocent, darling.

26:59.922 --> 27:04.144
Please,
you don't have to do this.

27:04.187 --> 27:06.668
You came here to stop us.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.062
But now you'll join us.

27:09.105 --> 27:10.541
[crying]

27:13.632 --> 27:16.896
And it will be
a wonderful journey.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.512
Ex-Temple member Josh Palmer and
his girlfriend Jasmine Delgado.

27:24.555 --> 27:25.818
Would've been better off hiding

27:25.861 --> 27:27.341
in that house with
their friends.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.169
A BOLO hit on Josh's car
led cops to this motel.

27:29.212 --> 27:31.040
No traffic cams nearby,
so we lost 'em.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.694
The Pearsons could have
taken 'em anywhere by now.

27:32.738 --> 27:33.913
Ruth's kidnapping
innocents to sacrifice

27:33.956 --> 27:35.741
just so the numbers add up.

27:35.784 --> 27:39.135
Three more violent abductions,
each reported in the past hour,

27:39.179 --> 27:40.441
each within the vicinity

27:40.484 --> 27:42.312
of a Temple member's
last known address.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.445
Six victims.That makes 36.

27:44.488 --> 27:47.448
A convoy. Those people
are gonna get executed.

27:47.491 --> 27:50.059
A mass homicide just to
fulfill some insane prophecy.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.626
A brainwashed cult
leading people around

27:51.670 --> 27:53.410
at gunpoint
in the middle of L.A.?

27:53.454 --> 27:55.151
Someone's got to spot it
and call it in.

27:55.195 --> 27:58.154
Where are they hoping
to pull something off like this?

27:58.198 --> 27:59.939
Chem test came back.

27:59.982 --> 28:01.680
The liquid in that girl's
pouch was saline solution,

28:01.723 --> 28:03.464
paint thinner, turpentine.

28:03.507 --> 28:04.770
Flammable blend.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.380
She wanted to burn
until there was nothing left.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.251
Nine years ago, there was an
industrial-sized propane tank

28:08.295 --> 28:10.079
outside the Temple's compound.Yeah, I remember that.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.777
I figured they just kept it
for survival purposes,

28:11.820 --> 28:13.648
but knowing their affinity
for burning alive,

28:13.692 --> 28:15.302
it just might've been
their plan B.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.391
Ruth just didn't get the
chance to pull it off.

28:17.434 --> 28:20.263
Think she's planning on taking
all 36 out in a blaze of glory?

28:23.223 --> 28:25.007
They want me to wait in here
until you're ready to talk.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.619
What's in your hand?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.278
That's Astrid.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.280
She's so young.She might be
Astrid to you,

28:37.324 --> 28:39.152
but her real name is Clare.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.503
Her mom Pam is watching.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.287
Her mother's here?

28:44.331 --> 28:46.333
You think the Temple
has all the answers?

28:46.376 --> 28:47.856
What if they're just trying
to manipulate you?

28:47.900 --> 28:49.336
I chose to join.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.077
I chose to seek
perfection.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.513
No one manipulated me.

28:52.556 --> 28:55.516
Look where you are.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.910
Was this what they promised?

28:57.953 --> 28:59.476
To be turned over
to the cops as bait,

28:59.520 --> 29:01.130
spend your life in prison?

29:01.174 --> 29:02.871
I volunteered.I bet those brothers

29:02.915 --> 29:04.481
weren't too quick
to step forward.

29:04.525 --> 29:06.309
That's what happens in groups
like the Temple.

29:06.353 --> 29:07.789
Women are seen,
not heard.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.356
Cook, clean,

29:09.399 --> 29:11.793
serve men.
Any men who want to be served.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.404
You don't know
why we do what we do.

29:17.146 --> 29:19.322
I know about the 14-year-old
girls who Wayne Pearson's

29:19.366 --> 29:20.846
paired off with the men
in the group.

29:30.856 --> 29:34.424
Ruth was the one
that partnered us off.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.818
[chair scrapes]She called it marriage.

29:39.386 --> 29:41.605
They're not going
to Andromeda,

29:41.649 --> 29:43.607
and they're not gonna end up
in another planet.

29:43.651 --> 29:46.045
They're on their way to being
locked up or being dead,

29:46.088 --> 29:47.394
unless you stop it.

29:49.962 --> 29:52.181
Where's Ruth taking this convoy?

29:52.225 --> 29:55.228
[exhales]

29:55.271 --> 29:57.273
I don't know.

29:59.406 --> 30:03.453
They used to talk about some
clearing deep in the woods,

30:03.497 --> 30:05.804
surrounded by oaks.

30:05.847 --> 30:09.242
Never said where.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.810
I can't help you any more.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.863
Anything?

30:21.907 --> 30:23.169
We alerted San Bernardino,

30:23.212 --> 30:24.953
Los Padres,
and Big Bear National Parks.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.520
Officers posted at
every entrance.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.304
Yeah, but transporting
36 people that far,

30:28.348 --> 30:29.610
some unwilling?

30:29.653 --> 30:31.481
You think they'll
stay closer to home?

30:31.525 --> 30:33.266
Check out the scanner.

30:33.309 --> 30:35.007
Angeles National Forest.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.878
Park ranger just reported
50 camping stove fuel tanks

30:36.922 --> 30:38.445
stolen from a shed.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.055
Somebody just got a hell
of a lot of kerosene.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.448
Where'd that go down?

30:41.491 --> 30:42.928
Buckhorn Campground.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.538
Let's gear up.

30:58.987 --> 31:01.990
We need to section off
over a thousand acres of woods

31:02.034 --> 31:03.818
north of this campground!

31:03.862 --> 31:05.167
They got to be
down here somewhere!

31:05.211 --> 31:06.821
All right, let's switch up here.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.562
Luca's our eyes
in the sky.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.477
He's looking for signs
of an encampment.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.218
Keep your radios cranked up.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.306
How many trails start from here?

31:13.349 --> 31:15.351
LUCA:
I'm counting five!

31:15.395 --> 31:17.614
Three to the east,
two to the south!

31:17.658 --> 31:19.138
Street and I got
the trails to the south.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.661
DEACON:
All right, Chris and Tan,
you're with me.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.228
Okay.We'll take the east.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.621
RUTH:
They came for us before.

31:24.665 --> 31:29.800
Today... they are giving us
a second chance.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.325
They are waiting
for us to ascend.

31:32.368 --> 31:35.371
Are you ready to free your soul?

31:35.415 --> 31:37.199
CROWD:
Yes!

31:37.243 --> 31:38.592
Then let's all convoy home.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.594
[muffled screaming]

31:51.257 --> 31:53.259
[low humming]

31:55.914 --> 31:58.133
Be strong.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.701
We're almost there.

32:03.573 --> 32:04.531
Anyone else smell that?

32:04.574 --> 32:06.098
Luca, you spot

32:06.141 --> 32:07.708
any sign of them
near our location?

32:07.751 --> 32:09.840
LUCA:
Wait, it looks like something,

32:09.884 --> 32:10.841
maybe south, southeast?

32:10.885 --> 32:11.886
Roger that.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.153
Street, Street.

32:18.197 --> 32:21.069
[low humming in distance]

32:21.113 --> 32:23.071
This is 20-David. We're close.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.291
Let's move, let's move.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.684
RUTH:
We'll ascend through the fire,

32:27.728 --> 32:29.686
to a...
LAPD!

32:29.730 --> 32:31.514
Hands where we can see 'em!

32:31.558 --> 32:33.647
[overlapping shouting]

32:41.437 --> 32:43.570
[screams]
MAN:
Get down!

32:46.921 --> 32:48.879
Move in now!

32:52.622 --> 32:54.973
[muffled screaming]

32:58.933 --> 33:01.718
Deacon, you and me, let's move!

33:01.762 --> 33:02.850
The rest of you, cover us!

33:09.030 --> 33:11.685
HONDO:
Move. Go, go, go, go.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.514
STREET:
Drop your weapons.
On the ground.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.690
On the ground.
Flat on the ground.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.435
Astrid.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.742
Clare.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.311
Okay, put that down.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.704
Put that down.
We're here to help.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.533
We're here to help.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.713
Give me your hands.

33:44.239 --> 33:47.808
Tracking Ruth and Ben Pearson,
both armed, one hostage.

33:53.466 --> 33:54.945
Left!
Right!

33:58.210 --> 34:01.561
[grunts, screams]

34:01.604 --> 34:02.692
I got you, I got you.
It's okay.

34:05.304 --> 34:08.307
[Jasmine crying]Are you okay?

34:08.350 --> 34:11.310
Come on.
Yeah, it's okay.

34:15.401 --> 34:17.316
[helicopter blades whirring]

34:21.798 --> 34:23.539
Place your weapon on the ground.

34:23.583 --> 34:24.801
Don't bother telling me

34:24.845 --> 34:27.108
I'm surrounded
and I need to give up.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.723
Ever think about death?

34:34.855 --> 34:37.205
I've seen my fair share of it.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.476
I meant your own.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.130
Put the gun down, Ruth.

34:55.745 --> 34:57.138
[gunshot][screams]

34:57.182 --> 34:59.488
[grunts]

35:04.537 --> 35:05.755
There's no martyrs today.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.155
PAM:
Clare?

35:14.199 --> 35:15.461
Clare?

35:15.504 --> 35:16.723
CHRIS:
I doubt Pam will
even be around

35:16.766 --> 35:18.725
by the time
her daughter gets out.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.683
DEACON:
Clare brought vulnerable
people into the fold.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.903
She made a choice.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.518
Toughest thing
about raising kids:

35:29.562 --> 35:32.434
how do you keep them
from making a decision

35:32.478 --> 35:34.219
that you know is bad for 'em?

35:34.262 --> 35:36.830
Pam only wanted to save her
daughter from these people.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.048
Look what it got her.

35:38.092 --> 35:39.833
Well, she saved her grandchild.

35:39.876 --> 35:43.619
Saved Clare, too, in a way.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.840
She'll have plenty of
time to think about it.

35:46.883 --> 35:50.060
Maybe get her head on straight.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.324
At least she's alive.

35:52.367 --> 35:54.369
Yeah.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.419
HONDO:
Kai.

36:00.462 --> 36:02.812
This is Dr. Wendy Hughes.Ah, pleased to meet you,
Dr. Hughes.

36:02.856 --> 36:06.381
Wendy's fine. Some of
the folks SWAT arrested

36:06.425 --> 36:08.818
are in need of guidance
over the next few days,

36:08.862 --> 36:10.777
so thank you so much for
letting me pick your brain.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.474
Oh, I'm happy to help
however I can.

36:12.518 --> 36:13.780
It's serious trauma.

36:13.823 --> 36:15.695
It'll be a long road back.

36:15.738 --> 36:16.870
It took me years.

36:16.913 --> 36:18.437
I just thought
it'd be a good idea

36:18.480 --> 36:19.742
to get the two of you linked up.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.396
Appreciate the
introduction, Sergeant.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.442
I can take it from here.

36:24.486 --> 36:25.835
Uh, give me one second.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.794
Mm-hmm.Hey, Hondo.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.274
Uh, before you go...

36:31.319 --> 36:33.626
There's something
I've been needing to say.

36:35.410 --> 36:39.153
You know, it's been a while
since I thought about that day.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.329
Same here.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.332
Earlier, you said that...

36:44.376 --> 36:47.770
that you knew that I didn't want
to shoot you nine years ago.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.645
I pulled the trigger.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.214
My pistol jammed.

36:57.302 --> 37:01.131
Man, I was... so lost back then.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.961
But I tried to kill you.

37:07.007 --> 37:09.749
And I'm so, so sorry.

37:10.793 --> 37:12.795
But I owed you the truth.

37:28.768 --> 37:31.510
Vandelli said the tostada
was the best he's ever tasted.

37:31.553 --> 37:32.946
Maybe he'll jump in
on the food truck.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.121
I hope Luca knows
it's nothing personal.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.428
You know?It's the business model.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.430
Only one out of ten
restaurants makes it.

37:38.473 --> 37:39.866
Got to imagine the odds are
even worse for a food truck.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.215
Some pretty great chow, though.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.825
DEACON:
Yeah, it is.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.697
But it's risky,
and Luca's about as far

37:44.740 --> 37:46.307
from an accountant or a
businessman as you can get.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.917
Well, he's a big boy,

37:47.961 --> 37:50.311
and this is real money
he's asking for. He gets it.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.270
STREET:
He'll be onto
the next thing in no time.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.625
Luca.

37:59.668 --> 38:01.235
Yo.Xiomara got any
of that dinner behind?

38:01.279 --> 38:02.889
Hearing those fools talk
about her grub all damn day

38:02.932 --> 38:04.456
got me some type of hungry.I don't know.

38:04.499 --> 38:07.154
Check the fridge, bro.Ah, right here. Okay.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.852
All right, let's see
what she's working with.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.334
[sighs]

38:15.293 --> 38:16.729
Oh.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.600
All right,
I guess the hype is real.

38:20.689 --> 38:22.648
Hey.

38:22.691 --> 38:25.128
There's a lot
of food trucks out there, man.

38:25.172 --> 38:28.175
You sure you thought this
all the way through?Oh, hell, yeah, man.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.177
And people would flock to it.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.571
All right, let's say
you get a late-night call.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.355
Yeah.Truck breaks down.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.357
How you gonna get it back on
the road before the bars close?

38:36.401 --> 38:38.011
Well, Marty Jensen's been
looking for something to do

38:38.054 --> 38:40.056
ever since he retired
from the garage.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.407
And if Xiomara gets the flu?Her niece Rosita has
all her recipes, man.

38:42.450 --> 38:45.453
She said she'd take every
hour that we could give her.How many burritos

38:45.497 --> 38:47.020
you got to make to pay
all these people, Luca?

38:47.063 --> 38:48.891
Dude, we don't do burritos.

38:48.935 --> 38:50.284
It's Guatemalan, man.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.851
Look, I got it all lined up.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.374
Once the truck's
out on the road,

38:53.418 --> 38:56.072
I think we'd be in the black
after, like, three months.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.423
All right, listen,
I'm not sure what kind of advice

38:58.466 --> 39:00.425
I can give you
as an investor.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.035
Look, I get it, all right?

39:02.078 --> 39:04.820
You don't have to feel
obligated to let me down easy.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.301
I'm good.[sniffs]

39:07.345 --> 39:09.782
Luca, when you bought
that house,

39:09.825 --> 39:11.218
I wasn't sure
it was gonna last.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.046
Just telling you the truth.

39:13.089 --> 39:15.309
But you made it work, man.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.050
And when Kelly got rejected
from that school,

39:17.093 --> 39:18.573
you didn't just write
a letter.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.967
You showed up in person,
and you fixed the problem.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.621
Look, man,
I don't need a spreadsheet

39:22.664 --> 39:24.623
to know you have
what it takes to do this.

39:24.666 --> 39:25.798
Now, I don't know
where you're gonna get

39:25.841 --> 39:27.321
the rest
of the money from, but...

39:27.365 --> 39:29.584
you can put me down for $5K.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.020
And you ain't got to worry.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.414
I'm the silent type
of partner

39:33.458 --> 39:35.416
because you're gonna kill it.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.985
I don't know what to say, man.

39:40.290 --> 39:42.249
You don't got to say nothing.

39:42.292 --> 39:44.251
Just do the damn thing.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.296
[chuckles]

39:50.953 --> 39:53.303
Today was a roller coaster.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.305
It ain't over yet.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.177
HICKS:
Excuse me. What are you doing?

39:57.220 --> 39:59.962
I, uh...

40:09.929 --> 40:11.147
HICKS:
Lieutenant.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.366
You want to tell me
why your name's

40:12.410 --> 40:13.715
getting stenciled onto a door

40:13.759 --> 40:15.630
in our building?
LYNCH:
I am so sorry.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.545
That was supposed to
happen tomorrow morning

40:17.589 --> 40:19.460
after I spoke to you.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.941
Just how long is this review
of yours gonna take?It's finished.

40:21.984 --> 40:23.246
I already sent it to the mayor.

40:23.290 --> 40:24.596
Then why do you need an office?To phase in

40:24.639 --> 40:26.946
the changes the mayor
and I discussed.Such as?

40:26.989 --> 40:29.252
Maximizing SWAT's
value to the city.

40:29.296 --> 40:30.819
Now you're an efficiency expert
in my department?

40:30.863 --> 40:32.212
No, I'm not here to tell you

40:32.255 --> 40:34.127
how to do things, just
to reorient your thinking

40:34.170 --> 40:35.955
about what SWAT can do.HONDO:
What the hell

40:35.998 --> 40:37.696
is that supposed to mean?Almost every time
I come in here,

40:37.739 --> 40:40.307
I see officers sparring in
that ring. Now, I get it.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.483
Physical conditioning is
important. So is training.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.485
It's what keeps officers alive.And it's one of the reasons

40:44.529 --> 40:46.356
SWAT has the best
cops in the city.

40:46.400 --> 40:50.012
But maybe all of these great
cops can be put to better use

40:50.056 --> 40:53.363
in the field before
someone has to call 911.

40:54.582 --> 40:57.324
I believe SWAT's
being underutilized.

40:57.367 --> 41:00.066
In your one-day opinion.The mayor thinks
extremely highly of SWAT.

41:00.109 --> 41:03.156
So do I. That's why
she's placing me here

41:03.199 --> 41:05.071
as a consultant outside
the chain of command.

41:05.114 --> 41:07.639
Now, I'm sorry this got
sprung on you like this,

41:07.682 --> 41:10.468
but we are going to be
asking more from SWAT.

41:10.511 --> 41:11.904
It's a compliment.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.949
And I know you're up to it.

41:13.993 --> 41:17.170
