31:53.317 --> 31:57.537
It's not my fault either.

31:57.571 --> 31:59.089
No, it's not.

31:59.123 --> 32:02.959
Look, I'll tell him
to call you.

32:02.994 --> 32:05.829
I don't know if he will.

32:09.133 --> 32:12.886
We're starting
with act two, please.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.106
No Julia. Again.

32:16.140 --> 32:18.875
She's under the weather.

32:18.909 --> 32:20.610
Flu or something.

32:23.314 --> 32:26.783
I'm gonna kill him.
Leo, not Mason.

32:26.817 --> 32:28.451
I'm gonna kill 'em both,
and I'm gonna kill

32:28.486 --> 32:30.437
- that know-nothing mother.
- Frank, Frank, honey.

32:30.488 --> 32:31.988
It's okay. It's okay.
You don't need to...

32:32.023 --> 32:33.323
Don't tell me
what to do.

32:33.357 --> 32:34.607
Okay. Okay, Frank.

32:34.658 --> 32:36.559
But you know what?

32:36.594 --> 32:38.461
You are always
so good in a crisis,

32:38.496 --> 32:42.632
and you hold everything in
so that I can lose it.

32:42.666 --> 32:45.001
And then, after everything
is better, you lose it.

32:45.036 --> 32:47.003
But that's the thing.
You don't have to.

32:47.038 --> 32:50.306
He's okay.

32:54.295 --> 32:56.780
You don't think
I should go get him?

32:56.814 --> 33:00.016
He just needs
a little room.

33:06.490 --> 33:09.526
I was so scared.

33:11.228 --> 33:13.980
I know.

33:18.903 --> 33:21.704
Ellis, would you make
another smoothie?

33:21.739 --> 33:23.156
You want one?
They're awesome.

33:23.207 --> 33:24.624
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

33:24.658 --> 33:26.326
I'm gonna go get some chips.

33:26.377 --> 33:28.144
It's a really short break.
You want me to go?

33:28.179 --> 33:29.946
Oh, no, I'll do it.
I gotta get the right ones.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.782
No peanut oil.

33:32.817 --> 33:34.684
[Sighs]

33:34.718 --> 33:36.553
It's like some
demented fairy tale.

33:36.587 --> 33:39.689
You drink a magic potion,
you kiss a movie star,

33:39.723 --> 33:43.560
and presto,
you're one too.

33:43.594 --> 33:45.862
Are they really that awesome?

33:45.896 --> 33:48.031
They are all
she drinks and eats.

33:48.065 --> 33:49.332
And potato chips.

33:49.366 --> 33:51.901
And potato chips.

33:51.936 --> 33:54.003
- Ellis?
- Hm?

33:54.038 --> 33:56.172
Would you do something
for me?

33:56.207 --> 33:58.641
For you, anything.

33:58.676 --> 34:00.410
Don't you want to know
what it is first?

34:00.444 --> 34:03.446
Hit me.
I'll do it.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.514
Hey. Can I borrow your phone?

34:14.650 --> 34:16.449
Thanks.

34:16.467 --> 34:17.668
Are we back?

34:17.719 --> 34:20.054
Rebecca's not here.

34:20.088 --> 34:22.123
- Where is she?
- Oh, she went out.

34:22.157 --> 34:23.556
Went out why?

34:23.592 --> 34:26.594
Potato chips.
I think she needs special ones.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.685
Special potato chips.

34:34.735 --> 34:37.071
Terrific.

34:37.105 --> 34:38.873
We should get
to your song today.

34:38.907 --> 34:41.742
Oh. No, we're not.

34:41.777 --> 34:43.527
Julia has the flu.
I'm done for the day.

34:43.578 --> 34:46.030
Oh, okay.
See you later. Bye.

34:46.081 --> 34:48.049
Ms. Duvall,
can I have your autograph?

34:48.083 --> 34:49.550
Sure.

34:52.888 --> 34:54.088
Hey.

34:54.121 --> 34:56.357
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:56.391 --> 34:59.326
You are 15 minutes late
from a 10-minute break.

34:59.344 --> 35:01.328
- Derek, calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm do...

35:01.346 --> 35:02.763
You get that bloody thing
out of my face.

35:02.798 --> 35:04.098
Hey, hey!

35:04.132 --> 35:05.766
I could have you arrested
for that!

35:05.801 --> 35:07.935
Yeah, good luck with that.
Let's go.

35:07.969 --> 35:09.720
- I want them gone.
- I don't tell them...

35:09.771 --> 35:12.440
Oh, just call your publicist
and get rid of them.

35:12.474 --> 35:14.608
And get your ass
to my rehearsals on time,

35:14.643 --> 35:15.943
and stop messing about
with your understudy.

35:15.977 --> 35:18.045
In fact, stop messing about
with me.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.447
This show
is going to Broadway,

35:19.481 --> 35:21.182
where it's going to be
a blinding hit.

35:21.216 --> 35:23.751
I am not about to let
some stupid little movie star

35:23.785 --> 35:27.204
with childish power issues
stop it... or me.

35:27.239 --> 35:30.891
Okay.

35:30.926 --> 35:32.259
Chip?

35:32.294 --> 35:34.028
No.

35:34.062 --> 35:37.898
Right. Having lost 20 minutes
to miss Duvall's need

35:37.933 --> 35:39.633
for her oh-so-special
potato chips,

35:39.668 --> 35:41.769
we are now finally
in a position to start

35:41.803 --> 35:43.404
<i>Secondhand</i>
<i>white baby grand,</i>

35:43.438 --> 35:44.905
marking the transition
into <i>dig deep.</i>

35:44.940 --> 35:48.559
Karen Cartwright.

35:48.593 --> 35:49.944
Where is Karen Cartwright?!

35:49.978 --> 35:52.113
- She went home.
- Terrific.

35:52.147 --> 35:55.583
- She got a text...
- Be quiet!

35:55.617 --> 35:59.920
Ivy. Do you know it?

35:59.955 --> 36:02.656
Yes. Yes, I do.

36:02.691 --> 36:03.941
Great, it's yours.

36:03.992 --> 36:05.326
You okay with that, Tom?

36:05.360 --> 36:07.394
- Yes, I am.
- Fine.

36:07.412 --> 36:09.113
Marilyn,
you're center stage.

36:09.164 --> 36:12.433
Ivy, you're in the shadowbox
upstage center right.

36:12.467 --> 36:15.453
<i>Now!</i>

36:24.012 --> 36:26.147
Hey.

36:26.181 --> 36:29.183
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:32.521 --> 36:34.588
I'm sorry.

36:34.623 --> 36:36.457
I shouldn't have done that.

36:36.491 --> 36:40.795
I couldn't stand...

36:40.829 --> 36:42.963
I know you kept saying
it wasn't my fault,

36:42.998 --> 36:45.266
but I felt like I was
losing everything,

36:45.300 --> 36:46.500
and I didn't know why.

36:46.535 --> 36:47.785
You're not losing...

36:47.819 --> 36:49.170
Dad, come on.

36:49.204 --> 36:51.839
I am.
We are.

36:55.977 --> 36:58.979
I don't know
what anything is any more.

37:03.819 --> 37:07.621
Dinner will make us all
feel better.

37:07.656 --> 37:09.523
Will it?

37:09.558 --> 37:14.061
Yes, it will.

37:14.095 --> 37:17.097
Go set the table.

37:23.655 --> 37:25.840
You okay?

37:25.874 --> 37:27.074
Tom, you okay?

37:27.108 --> 37:29.994
[Exhales heavily]

37:30.028 --> 37:32.246
He's back.
He came back.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.914
That is really
wonderful news.

37:33.949 --> 37:35.249
He's back.
He's fine. He's back.

37:35.283 --> 37:37.718
- Yeah, he's back!
- [Laughing]

37:37.752 --> 37:40.354
So...

37:40.388 --> 37:43.524
The idea is, uh,
I lie here

37:43.558 --> 37:46.160
and listen to her sing.

37:46.194 --> 37:47.895
She's a voice in your head.

37:47.929 --> 37:51.265
Okay.

37:53.268 --> 37:55.553
Okay, go ahead.

37:55.604 --> 37:59.440
Remember. Remember.

37:59.474 --> 38:01.609
[Imitating Marilyn]
Is that all I have to do?

38:01.643 --> 38:04.879
That's all you have to do,
my dear Marilyn.

38:04.913 --> 38:08.349
Look within.

38:08.383 --> 38:11.418
It's who you are
in your deepest soul

38:11.453 --> 38:13.954
that will make you
a great actress.

38:13.989 --> 38:15.556
A great actress.

38:15.590 --> 38:18.058
A great actress.

38:18.093 --> 38:20.060
Hmm. Hmm.

38:20.095 --> 38:22.863
Remember your youth.

38:22.898 --> 38:24.565
Mama bought the piano.

38:24.599 --> 38:26.767
Remember your childhood.

38:26.801 --> 38:29.403
Then mama went away.
