WEBVTT

00:03.664 --> 00:07.915
Mail clerk at Dutton &amp; Howser,
greeter at Yarn Mart,

00:08.276 --> 00:11.805
pre-school assistant.
How are you at diapers?

00:12.126 --> 00:15.334
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

00:15.655 --> 00:18.803
No? Well, let's see, how about this?

00:18.904 --> 00:20.989
Bagger at Grocery Plus.

00:21.310 --> 00:25.962
Cashier at Lucy's Landscaping.

00:26.403 --> 00:30.012
Computer programmer...
I don't think so.

00:32.137 --> 00:33.963
Listen, I was just curious.

00:34.063 --> 00:37.712
Why have all the temp jobs you've
sent me out on been so unusual?

00:38.113 --> 00:40.239
Unusual? What's unusual
about a fruit packer?

00:41.843 --> 00:43.387
Okay, maybe it's not the job.

00:43.487 --> 00:45.934
It's kind of what happens to me
after I get there.

00:46.254 --> 00:49.162
Things just kind of go little wonky.

00:49.262 --> 00:51.909
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

00:52.831 --> 00:54.656
- No.
- No.

00:54.756 --> 00:56.741
No. Okay, maybe it's just
a coincidence.

00:56.842 --> 00:58.847
Although I don't believe
in coincidences.

00:59.448 --> 01:02.216
Okay, look, here's the thing.
I'm not picky.

01:02.536 --> 01:09.154
I'll take anything as long as it's really,
really normal.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.201
Oh, you want normal.

01:13.525 --> 01:15.811
I've got the perfect thing for you.

01:22.628 --> 01:26.358
This is not what I had in mind.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.196
Wasn't someone supposed
to call a trump?

01:33.296 --> 01:36.163
Oh, yes, right. Trump.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.808
I was just waiting for you.

01:37.908 --> 01:40.354
Oh, I see.

01:41.517 --> 01:44.365
Still can't believe you know
how to play pinochle.

01:44.725 --> 01:47.633
Not a lot of young people
do anymore, you know.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.079
I used to play with my grandma
all the time.

01:50.180 --> 01:53.468
- Really? Lucky me.
- No, actually, lucky me.

01:53.829 --> 01:57.519
Babysitting a sick old lady?
How is that lucky for you?

01:59.123 --> 02:00.306
Well?

02:00.406 --> 02:03.374
Well, I think it's time
for your medicine.

02:05.539 --> 02:07.544
Watch out!

02:10.872 --> 02:13.179
Mother? What, are you okay?

02:13.279 --> 02:16.548
I'm okay, the sons of bitches
missed me.

02:16.648 --> 02:18.753
Really, I'm okay.

02:18.854 --> 02:21.701
So much for normal.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.156
Piper, do you mind?

04:08.256 --> 04:10.382
I'm trying to meditate,
if you haven't noticed.

04:10.703 --> 04:14.092
- Can't you block out the noise?
- The vacuum cleaner I can block out,

04:14.192 --> 04:16.678
- your nerves I can't.
- My nerves?

04:17.801 --> 04:19.144
Oh, for God's sakes, woman.

04:19.245 --> 04:21.471
I'm sorry, you're anxious,
I'm anxious.

04:21.571 --> 04:23.797
But it's my first date, it's not yours.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.343
Unfortunately, it feels as though
it's my first date.

04:26.664 --> 04:27.887
Can't you control it?

04:27.987 --> 04:30.474
What do you think I'm doing,
cleaning the chandelier?

04:30.795 --> 04:32.800
Now that would be helpful.

04:35.848 --> 04:37.672
Talk about your psychic hit.

04:37.773 --> 04:40.179
Hi, how's it going? Don't ask.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.705
Are you hurt? What happened?

04:43.026 --> 04:44.530
It's nothing, I'm fine.

04:44.630 --> 04:46.636
You're not fine, Paige,
you're scared to death.

04:46.956 --> 04:49.142
Why don't people in this family
own their emotions?

04:49.242 --> 04:51.669
Okay, this empath thing?
Very annoying.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.774
Copy that. Hey.

04:55.298 --> 04:57.323
You haven't seen Leo, have you?

04:57.424 --> 04:59.429
Oh, Chris, not now.

05:01.795 --> 05:04.622
- Paige?
- It's nothing, I'm fine.

05:04.722 --> 05:07.750
It doesn't look like nothing to me.
Was that an energy ball?

05:07.850 --> 05:11.039
I don't know, I was playing pinochle,
I didn't see.

05:11.139 --> 05:14.668
I'm temping. Grandma, she's got
some dark secrets, let me tell you.

05:14.989 --> 05:17.696
- Another temp job involving magic?
- Yeah, right,

05:17.796 --> 05:19.741
I'm never gonna get away.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.847
But you want to.

05:22.368 --> 05:23.832
Sorry.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.779
<i>- Do you want me to get the Book?</i>
<i>- No, actually, I don't.</i>

05:27.100 --> 05:30.108
I wanna follow this one through
all by myself.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.878
She's feeling a little suppressed
by us.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.106
You are?

05:37.206 --> 05:40.074
You know, what I was talking about.
The temp job thing.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.463
Why I'm trying to find my own path,
just separate from...

05:43.823 --> 05:45.648
From us?

05:45.748 --> 05:48.295
- I checked, no sign of...
- I should cancel my date.

05:48.395 --> 05:49.819
What? Why?

05:49.919 --> 05:51.343
Because we're having issues.

05:51.443 --> 05:53.649
No, the issue is you're afraid
to date, Piper.

05:53.970 --> 05:56.877
But you can't let your fears stop you.
You should.

05:56.977 --> 05:59.163
Gee, I wonder why
I'm feeling suppressed.

05:59.263 --> 06:01.790
Phoebe, this is ridiculous.
It's just getting worse.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.494
I know.

06:03.595 --> 06:06.582
So, what should I do?
Just keep all your feelings to myself?

06:06.683 --> 06:08.347
Would that make you guys happy?

06:08.447 --> 06:09.710
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:09.811 --> 06:12.056
Okay, then that's what I'll do.

06:14.864 --> 06:17.069
Someone's hiding something
from me.

06:18.553 --> 06:21.160
Just let me know if anyone
sees Leo, okay?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.047
I gotta go back
and check on grandma.

06:24.368 --> 06:26.273
Wait, you're going?
You're scared to death...

06:26.373 --> 06:28.619
- Apple!
- I can't believe you'd still go...

06:34.154 --> 06:36.159
Well, that's one way to do it.

06:43.417 --> 06:46.205
All sold out, I'm afraid.

06:46.305 --> 06:49.273
Good for me, bad for you.

06:49.634 --> 06:53.082
- How long will it take to make more?
- The potion you desire

06:53.483 --> 06:55.529
is pricey for a reason.

06:55.850 --> 07:01.384
The main ingredient is quite rare
and hard to come by.

07:03.389 --> 07:06.136
What secret are you
so eager to hide?

07:06.236 --> 07:08.603
Just tell me how long.

07:09.405 --> 07:12.653
Hard to say. Six weeks or a month.

07:12.974 --> 07:16.703
Demonic suppliers
are notoriously unreliable.

07:17.105 --> 07:19.110
I can't wait, all right? I need it now.

07:20.393 --> 07:22.478
The impatience of youth.

07:23.120 --> 07:27.371
Then again, it takes a young heart
to brave great danger.

07:27.772 --> 07:29.637
Spare me the Morpheus speech,
old man.

07:29.737 --> 07:31.742
What are you saying?

07:32.424 --> 07:37.958
Swampland is where you'll find
the kotochu egg your potion requires.

07:40.926 --> 07:43.814
Now you understand the difficulty.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.521
Fine, I'll get you your damn egg.

07:46.621 --> 07:49.147
Just make sure you're ready
by the time I get back.

08:14.693 --> 08:16.759
Hi, it's me, Paige?

08:16.859 --> 08:18.603
Paige, your home-helper?

08:18.704 --> 08:20.709
Please buzz me in.

08:22.353 --> 08:24.358
Look, I know you're there.

08:25.521 --> 08:28.770
I am not gonna expose you,
I promise. I just wanna help.

08:29.692 --> 08:32.138
Don't you think it's a little risky
coming back here?

08:34.664 --> 08:36.328
Please buzz me in, Miss Callaway.

08:36.429 --> 08:38.534
No, seriously.
In case you didn't notice,

08:38.635 --> 08:41.322
there's kind of a war going on
between these two homes.

08:41.643 --> 08:45.052
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:45.974 --> 08:47.318
Don't you?

08:47.418 --> 08:48.761
It's me!

08:48.862 --> 08:51.007
Pinochle girl.

08:51.107 --> 08:56.802
Hey. You're not the first, you know.
Others have come to try to help.

08:59.249 --> 09:01.194
You should leave before you get hurt.

09:01.294 --> 09:03.299
I'm sure I can handle it, thanks.

09:05.184 --> 09:07.129
You're not a muse, that's for sure.

09:07.229 --> 09:09.234
Or a whitelighter.

09:11.119 --> 09:13.686
- You're a witch like us.
- How do you know that?

09:14.007 --> 09:17.656
Ever since I was a kid,
one sort of magical being or another

09:17.977 --> 09:19.982
has come to try to help end the feud.

09:21.707 --> 09:23.611
Hasn't worked though.

09:23.712 --> 09:27.040
I mean, this last truce
was the longest, but...

09:33.176 --> 09:35.001
Okay, go:

09:35.101 --> 09:37.949
Good. All right, take a look.

09:38.269 --> 09:39.533
Yeah, okay.

09:39.633 --> 09:42.440
Think newly-single mom,
not two-bit hooker.

09:42.761 --> 09:44.766
Okay, we try again.

09:45.488 --> 09:47.152
You're a little distracted.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.318
I'm having a very hard time
concentrating.

09:49.418 --> 09:50.681
I think this empath power

09:50.782 --> 09:52.246
- is driving me crazy.
- You?

09:52.346 --> 09:55.634
Well, you try having PMS
for three sisters every month.

09:55.955 --> 09:59.183
It's a good thing no one in the family
is having sex, I'd be feeling that too.

09:59.284 --> 10:01.971
Yeah, okay, so let's skip
the "vamp red."

10:02.291 --> 10:04.718
You know, if I can't ignore
the bloating

10:04.818 --> 10:07.124
and the cramping
and the mood swings,

10:07.224 --> 10:10.633
how am I supposed to ignore the fact
that my sister is scared to death?

10:10.994 --> 10:13.019
- Phoebe.
- All right, okay,

10:13.119 --> 10:15.105
I'm just gonna
mind my own business.

10:15.205 --> 10:17.471
All we have to do is respect
what Paige wants.

10:17.571 --> 10:20.278
And clearly what she wants
is not our help.

10:20.378 --> 10:23.607
She thinks that's what she wants,
but I know what she really wants.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.491
What she really wants is our help.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.657
- That's it, I'm staying home.
- What? Why?

10:27.757 --> 10:29.422
To make sure you leave Paige alone.

10:29.522 --> 10:32.309
No, Piper, no. You have to go out.

10:32.409 --> 10:35.698
You need to go out.
And this is not me channelling.

10:36.019 --> 10:38.004
This is just me talking.

10:38.104 --> 10:41.272
Trust me. The sooner you get back on
the dating horse, the easier it will be.

10:41.593 --> 10:44.140
No, I know. You're right,
you're absolutely right.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.105
The truth is, I'm a little scared.

10:46.205 --> 10:49.112
I mean, I was married to an angel,
for crying out loud.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.997
Who is gonna compare to that?

10:51.098 --> 10:54.045
But, Piper, you also dated a demon,
a warlock and a ghost.

10:54.145 --> 10:56.251
That's what you should be scared of.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.356
Super pep talk, sis.

11:00.763 --> 11:02.768
You look beautiful.

11:06.778 --> 11:08.362
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:08.462 --> 11:10.768
Wow, you look great.

11:10.869 --> 11:13.195
I'm not surprised, it's just that
you normally...

11:13.516 --> 11:15.882
Oh, yeah, no bottle, no binky.

11:16.202 --> 11:17.586
Yeah, no spit up.

11:17.686 --> 11:19.692
Yeah.

11:20.574 --> 11:22.579
So you ready? Wanna go?

11:25.426 --> 11:27.512
He likes you, I can tell.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.465
One second.

11:32.565 --> 11:34.550
Leave Paige alone, I mean it.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.655
I will. I will.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.202
- Okay.
- Have fun, have fun.

11:39.302 --> 11:43.473
I will leave Paige alone...
I can't. I can't. Chris!

11:44.195 --> 11:46.220
Yeah?

11:46.320 --> 11:48.105
I need you to watch Wyatt for me.

11:48.205 --> 11:50.210
What? No, no way.

11:50.732 --> 11:52.276
What's wrong?
Why are you worried?

11:52.376 --> 11:55.203
What's wrong?
What's wrong is I don't do babies.

11:55.304 --> 11:57.128
One-and-under crowd?
Not my thing.

11:57.229 --> 12:00.998
Leo, however, great with kids.
Especially his own.

12:02.402 --> 12:05.229
- You're not following me, are you?
- Why, should I be?

12:05.329 --> 12:07.796
Oh, there's a lot of love in this room.

12:07.896 --> 12:10.824
Okay, so there's a bottle in the fridge
if Wyatt wakes up

12:11.144 --> 12:13.932
and the diaper rash cream
only if he needs it, okay?

12:14.032 --> 12:16.759
We gotta keep that butt moist.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.245
Did you get that?

12:20.529 --> 12:22.514
Phoebe.
Phoebe, wait, wait, wait.

12:22.614 --> 12:25.261
I can't do this right now,
I gotta follow up...

12:25.943 --> 12:27.767
...on some things.

12:27.868 --> 12:29.211
I have to check on Paige

12:29.311 --> 12:32.259
- and make sure she's all right.
- Where's Piper?

12:32.359 --> 12:34.365
Piper is...

12:35.367 --> 12:37.372
She's kind of...

12:39.057 --> 12:41.062
Piper's on a date.

12:46.757 --> 12:49.443
I'm so sorry, you're hurting.

12:49.764 --> 12:52.552
I'm here for you.
I just can't be here for you right now.

12:52.652 --> 12:55.479
I'm gonna be in there for you,
though.

12:55.579 --> 12:57.585
Checking on Paige.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.072
<i>Lead me back</i>
<i>From whence this came</i>

13:08.172 --> 13:10.979
<i>Help me help my sister's pain</i>

13:15.872 --> 13:19.401
- I want her out of here, Richard.
- She wants the fighting to stop.

13:19.722 --> 13:22.709
Yeah? How come the fighting
started the minute she showed up?

13:22.810 --> 13:24.273
Probably just a coincidence.

13:24.374 --> 13:27.061
I thought you didn't believe
in coincidences.

13:32.555 --> 13:34.099
Hey.

13:34.199 --> 13:37.889
- Here, drink that.
- What is it?

13:38.691 --> 13:40.756
It's a family recipe,
make you feel better,

13:40.856 --> 13:42.862
speed up the healing process.

13:43.784 --> 13:46.872
I'm the one that shouldn't trust you,
remember? Drink up.

13:52.687 --> 13:54.692
Are those potions?

13:55.213 --> 13:58.041
Yeah, I told you, we're witches.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.765
Good ones or bad ones?

13:59.865 --> 14:01.650
What do you think?

14:01.750 --> 14:05.159
I don't know, you did just try to fry
an 80-year-old with an energy ball.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.568
That was the Callaways,
they made it look like it was us.

14:08.929 --> 14:11.034
- It was a setup.
- Okay, so they're bad?

14:11.135 --> 14:13.581
Well, no, they're not bad,
they're just bad to us.

14:18.193 --> 14:19.416
See those scars?

14:19.516 --> 14:21.742
Years ago, the Callaways
cast a plague on us.

14:21.842 --> 14:24.710
Of course, in return,
we cursed them with boils.

14:24.810 --> 14:27.096
Or was it the boils
and then the plague?

14:27.417 --> 14:31.026
I can't remember. A feud this long,
you start to lose track, you know.

14:31.427 --> 14:33.452
How come you don't have scars?

14:33.553 --> 14:37.001
You can't curse people
that don't practice magic.

14:37.322 --> 14:38.746
I don't do that anymore.

14:38.846 --> 14:40.851
Why not?

14:41.774 --> 14:47.308
Last time I did, it... It brought me
to a place I don't wanna go again.

14:50.436 --> 14:53.685
That's Olivia, my fiancÐ¹e.

14:54.046 --> 14:56.412
Olivia Callaway.

14:57.575 --> 14:59.560
Sleeping with the enemy.

14:59.660 --> 15:03.550
She was actually killed
in the crossfire last year.

15:05.515 --> 15:07.500
I'm... I'm really sorry.

15:07.601 --> 15:10.488
It's all right, you didn't know.

15:10.929 --> 15:13.756
She'd be more upset than anybody
that this truce ended.

15:13.857 --> 15:16.544
She... She wanted peace.

15:17.707 --> 15:19.712
Maybe that's why I'm here, to help.

15:44.095 --> 15:46.341
- Boo.
- What?

15:48.707 --> 15:50.772
Olivia?

15:50.872 --> 15:52.777
- But you're a...
- A ghost?

15:52.878 --> 15:55.123
Yeah. Sucks, too, believe me.

15:55.925 --> 15:58.251
- What do you want?
- What you took from me:

15:59.214 --> 16:02.101
My life, my love.

16:03.385 --> 16:06.753
And one way or another,
I'm gonna get them both back.

16:07.154 --> 16:09.741
Now, just wait a minute. Don't...

16:09.841 --> 16:12.448
There's a Charmed One here.
She'll come after you.

16:13.130 --> 16:15.135
I'm counting on it.

16:26.765 --> 16:29.232
Oh, please, God, no.

16:29.332 --> 16:31.618
Oh, my God.

16:51.389 --> 16:53.755
I'll have the salmon
with fusilli and the eggplant.

16:54.156 --> 16:57.725
And could you make sure they
use basil and not Italian parsley?

16:58.046 --> 17:01.695
And could you ask them to sautÐ¹
the eggplant lightly?

17:02.096 --> 17:05.305
And also grill the salmon
after the pasta is done?

17:05.626 --> 17:08.313
That way it won't dry out.
Thank you.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.223
- What?
- Nothing.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.652
I just never dated an ex-chef before,
that's all.

17:15.972 --> 17:17.516
Oh, was I being too picky?

17:17.617 --> 17:19.000
No, no.

17:19.099 --> 17:22.509
Yeah, I was. It's... I'm sorry,
I'm just a little...

17:22.869 --> 17:24.575
Nervous.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.859
- Is it that obvious?
- Nah, it's just...

17:26.961 --> 17:29.567
It's my fault, this is not a very good
first-date place.

17:29.888 --> 17:31.713
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

17:31.813 --> 17:36.064
It's just, you know,
that I haven't dated in a while.

17:36.425 --> 17:38.430
How long were you...
Were you married?

17:38.751 --> 17:40.937
Two years,
but we were together four.

17:41.037 --> 17:42.220
It gets easier.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.047
I think I went on five,
six dates after my divorce

17:45.368 --> 17:48.416
until finally I started feeling
comfortable dating people again.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.507
Oh, so I guess you don't mind
being the guinea pig then.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.635
Not at all.

18:00.006 --> 18:03.214
If you don't mind me asking,
when's your divorce finalized?

18:03.535 --> 18:04.839
My divorce?

18:04.939 --> 18:06.944
You... You filed, right?

18:07.546 --> 18:12.398
Not exactly. It's... It's kind of
a weird arrangement.

18:12.839 --> 18:14.423
It's hard to explain, but...

18:14.524 --> 18:16.228
Piper.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.454
What...? What are you doing here?

18:18.775 --> 18:20.198
Why are you covered in mud?

18:20.299 --> 18:22.825
Excuse me a second.
Who is this?

18:23.507 --> 18:25.512
Me? I'm from the future.

18:26.715 --> 18:28.720
- What?
- Excuse us.

18:32.249 --> 18:33.593
Are you crazy?

18:33.693 --> 18:35.698
You're not serious
about that guy, are you?

18:38.105 --> 18:40.290
You know what?
That is none of your business.

18:40.391 --> 18:42.817
- Where have you been?
- That's none of your business.

18:42.917 --> 18:45.163
You better get home
before your sisters kill each other.

18:45.484 --> 18:49.013
What? Why, what happened?
Oh, no. Phoebe?

18:52.462 --> 18:54.928
Paige, I said I'm sorry.
What more do you want from me?

18:55.028 --> 18:56.693
Sorry doesn't begin to cover it.

18:56.793 --> 18:59.099
I was worried about you.
I thought you were in trouble.

18:59.199 --> 19:02.969
- Then why were you at the Callaways'?
- The spell was to take me to you.

19:03.330 --> 19:05.495
How was I supposed to know
you were across the street?

19:05.816 --> 19:08.383
You weren't supposed to know.
You weren't supposed to be involved.

19:08.704 --> 19:12.393
It's a good thing I did get involved.
Obviously there's a war going on.

19:12.754 --> 19:14.759
- I can handle it.
- Really?

19:16.003 --> 19:19.973
- Hi! Hey, what is this about a war?
- Ask Miss Buttinsky over there.

19:20.334 --> 19:22.840
She was with the Callaways
when they killed Richard's dad.

19:22.940 --> 19:25.487
Paige, I'm telling you,
they didn't kill anyone.

19:25.587 --> 19:28.234
- I was there.
- Yeah, so was I.

19:28.555 --> 19:30.019
Can you guys keep it down?

19:30.119 --> 19:32.285
- I just got Wyatt to sleep.
- What are you doing here?

19:33.648 --> 19:37.217
Okay, in the living room,
in the living room. Let's go, let's go.

19:37.939 --> 19:39.724
- Can I go now?
- No.

19:39.824 --> 19:43.393
Paige, I'm telling you, the energy ball
did not come from the Callaways.

19:43.794 --> 19:46.521
I saw it come through
the Callaways' window.

19:46.842 --> 19:49.990
- It couldn't have.
- Oh, she's taking sides.

19:50.091 --> 19:52.758
Paige, it's not only what I saw,
but it's what I felt.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.003
Don't you think if they
just tried to kill someone,

19:55.104 --> 19:58.011
I would've felt some intense anger
coming from them? But I didn't.

19:58.111 --> 20:01.199
I don't know. Are you sensing any
intense anger coming at you right now?

20:02.162 --> 20:05.531
No, but what I can sense
is that maybe your attraction

20:05.851 --> 20:08.899
to this Richard guy is clouding
your better judgement.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.165
I hate talking to an empath.

20:11.265 --> 20:12.489
Wait a second, hold it.

20:12.589 --> 20:15.256
Didn't they fire on the Callaway
grandmother when you got hurt?

20:15.356 --> 20:17.060
Maybe this is just retribution.

20:17.161 --> 20:20.128
No, Richard said his family didn't
fire on them. I believe him.

20:20.489 --> 20:23.978
Then where did the energy ball
come from? They don't just materialize.

20:24.339 --> 20:26.164
- Maybe they do.
- What do you mean?

20:26.264 --> 20:29.212
Well, if Richard says
it was no one in his family,

20:29.312 --> 20:31.839
maybe it was somebody else,
maybe a third party.

20:32.159 --> 20:34.806
If so, the two families need to know
before this escalates.

20:35.127 --> 20:37.654
Do you think you could get them
to come here?

20:37.974 --> 20:40.401
- What, like peace talks?
- Yeah, why not?

20:40.501 --> 20:43.408
You've got an Elder right here,
who better to mediate?

20:43.509 --> 20:45.514
Good luck.

20:46.637 --> 20:48.060
I actually think this could work.

20:48.161 --> 20:50.427
I don't know, this feud's
gone back for generations.

20:50.527 --> 20:52.512
I don't even think
they know how it started.

20:52.612 --> 20:54.617
Still, it's worth a shot.

21:01.676 --> 21:03.741
Nicely done.

21:03.841 --> 21:07.210
- These aren't easy to find.
- Tell me about it.

21:07.531 --> 21:08.874
How long before it's ready?

21:08.975 --> 21:10.980
You'll have it...

21:11.541 --> 21:13.546
...when you need it.

21:21.126 --> 21:23.131
What are you doing?

21:23.693 --> 21:26.620
Paige, get out of here.
It's none of your business.

21:26.941 --> 21:30.009
- I thought you weren't using magic.
- Just save me the speech.

21:30.109 --> 21:32.515
I don't need it. Go save an innocent
or something.

21:32.836 --> 21:34.841
Yeah, I'm trying.

21:35.884 --> 21:37.949
Look, they killed my fiancÐ¹e,
they killed my dad,

21:38.050 --> 21:40.155
what do you want me to do,
just sit back and watch?

21:40.255 --> 21:42.301
We don't know
the Callaways even did it.

21:42.622 --> 21:44.627
Who then?

21:45.188 --> 21:47.053
- I don't know.
- "I don't know."

21:47.153 --> 21:50.241
Great. Just go, please,
before you get hurt.

21:54.532 --> 21:56.718
Hi. You have two choices.

21:56.818 --> 22:01.270
Either you go over to the Callaways'
and use your considerable influence,

22:01.631 --> 22:03.896
not to mention your fairly
neutral reputation,

22:03.997 --> 22:06.182
- and bring them to the peace table...
- What?

22:06.283 --> 22:09.310
Or I can orb your butt down
to purgatory

22:09.411 --> 22:12.338
and you can spend all of eternity
getting a lovely sunburn.

22:12.659 --> 22:14.644
- You're crazy.
- Quite possibly.

22:14.745 --> 22:18.955
More importantly, I'm serious.
Look, it's the only way to end the feud.

22:21.001 --> 22:23.447
It's what Olivia would have wanted,
right?

22:32.390 --> 22:33.613
This it?

22:33.714 --> 22:35.819
That's it, drop it in.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.584
What are you looking for?

22:37.684 --> 22:41.694
I want to see if Paige was actually hit
by an energy ball after all.

22:42.015 --> 22:44.301
- What else could it be?
- Let's see.

22:45.905 --> 22:47.690
So...

22:47.790 --> 22:49.795
...how was your date?

22:50.718 --> 22:52.342
Short.

22:52.442 --> 22:54.186
Oh, really? Sorry.

22:54.287 --> 22:58.257
Short? You mean, like,
"leprechaun" short?

22:58.578 --> 23:03.551
No, Leo, he wasn't short,
the date was cut short by this.

23:03.952 --> 23:06.177
Oh, right.

23:06.278 --> 23:08.283
Sorry.

23:09.606 --> 23:11.792
So...

23:11.892 --> 23:14.218
...don't you think
you should use protection?

23:14.860 --> 23:19.392
- I mean for your hands, the soup?
- Okay.

23:19.753 --> 23:24.124
Look, I know this is awkward,
me being here and all.

23:24.525 --> 23:25.989
It's just as I suspected.

23:26.089 --> 23:28.676
- What does that mean?
- Not you, the pan.

23:28.776 --> 23:29.999
Keep up, will you?

23:30.099 --> 23:32.666
Her shirt, it's getting lighter,
which means

23:32.987 --> 23:35.754
Paige was not hit by an energy ball,
she was hit by a plasma ball.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.180
- Plasma?
- And plasma only occurs

23:38.280 --> 23:40.566
on the spiritual plane.

23:41.489 --> 23:43.233
Okay, they're all here

23:43.333 --> 23:46.061
and these people are in major need
of peace talks.

23:46.742 --> 23:49.790
Actually, what they need is a sÐ¹ance.

23:51.715 --> 23:54.442
You think a ghost
is trying to break the truce?

23:54.763 --> 23:56.768
An angry relative maybe?

23:57.169 --> 23:59.415
Someone who's still tethered
to the feud.

23:59.736 --> 24:02.784
Someone who can't or won't let go.

24:04.348 --> 24:07.476
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- No time, sorry.

24:07.797 --> 24:08.980
This is ridiculous.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.306
- Just another one of their tricks.
- No, it's not.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.411
I asked them to come,
just let it play out.

24:13.732 --> 24:16.780
By summoning the spirit,
we bring them into our plane.

24:17.101 --> 24:21.151
So be careful not to break the circle
until we've helped it move on.

24:21.512 --> 24:24.159
Or else we're gonna have some
angry spirits running amok.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.485
Everybody ready?

24:29.012 --> 24:30.876
Phoebe?

24:30.977 --> 24:36.591
Oh, sorry. It's just there's...
Everybody's like:

24:55.881 --> 24:57.505
Paige?

24:57.605 --> 25:02.699
<i>Unknown spirit, we call to thee</i>
<i>Those who wish to set you free</i>

25:03.060 --> 25:08.353
<i>Cross on over so we may help</i>
<i>Come to us, reveal yourself</i>

25:11.080 --> 25:13.085
Hold on.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.332
Olivia.

25:23.432 --> 25:25.518
Hello, Daddy. Miss me?

25:30.571 --> 25:32.576
Richard.

25:32.977 --> 25:34.681
I don't understand.

25:34.782 --> 25:37.428
You attacked us. Why?

25:37.789 --> 25:40.155
Because you didn't avenge my death,
that's why.

25:40.917 --> 25:43.304
But you were hit by one of your own.

25:43.404 --> 25:46.091
Or so you were led to think.
But that's not exactly true.

25:46.412 --> 25:48.417
Is it, Steve?

25:52.227 --> 25:54.252
It was an accident.

25:54.352 --> 25:56.538
We were set up.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.262
Okay, don't break the chain.

25:58.362 --> 26:00.368
We wouldn't want that,
would we, Paige?

26:00.729 --> 26:03.375
Okay, we have to move this
along now because:

26:03.696 --> 26:05.320
This can't be right.

26:05.421 --> 26:07.426
That... That can't be you.

26:07.907 --> 26:11.797
I was wrong about the feud, Richard.
It can never end, I know that now.

26:14.163 --> 26:16.810
But that doesn't mean
we can't still be together.

26:17.733 --> 26:19.738
Once I have my revenge.

26:27.398 --> 26:30.606
- Your son killed my daughter.
- Your daughter killed my husband.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.496
Come on.

26:46.046 --> 26:48.051
Richard, don't go.

26:49.655 --> 26:52.342
Okay, next time I tell you to butt out,
butt out.

26:56.794 --> 26:58.799
Richard, wait.

26:59.681 --> 27:02.167
Why don't we go after Richard
together?

27:23.623 --> 27:25.829
Hey, what are you doing,
making soup?

27:26.831 --> 27:28.836
Not exactly.

27:29.879 --> 27:31.704
"Banishing a ghost."

27:31.804 --> 27:34.571
Wait, I thought we weren't gonna
try and help Paige anymore.

27:34.892 --> 27:37.078
We're not. We're assisting.

27:37.178 --> 27:39.123
Oh, we're assisting.

27:39.223 --> 27:42.552
We're just giving her a little ammo,
should she need it.

27:42.873 --> 27:45.640
You know, that was one
really pissed off ghost.

27:46.001 --> 27:47.785
That was also one
very pissed off sister.

27:47.886 --> 27:50.512
Which is why we are not helping her.
Not directly.

27:50.613 --> 27:52.618
We're just giving her an option.

27:55.225 --> 27:56.929
- You're worried.
- So?

27:57.029 --> 28:00.799
So you can actually worry,
and really you're just worried.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.689
Whereas if I worry, people think
that I'm psychically intruding.

28:05.050 --> 28:09.060
Precisely. Now, I need to call Leo
so he can babysit.

28:09.381 --> 28:11.567
I could call him if you want me to.

28:11.667 --> 28:13.652
Just trying to help.

28:13.752 --> 28:16.239
I know you want me to, though.

28:27.227 --> 28:29.794
- Knock, knock.
- You ever give up?

28:30.115 --> 28:32.120
Never.

28:32.802 --> 28:34.807
Penny for your thoughts.

28:36.170 --> 28:38.176
What?

28:39.098 --> 28:41.103
Olivia used to say that.

28:41.985 --> 28:45.956
Oh, I should be more careful.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.362
Must have been hard.

28:48.843 --> 28:50.908
Seeing her again after all that time.

28:51.009 --> 28:53.154
Yeah.

28:53.255 --> 28:55.079
She just seemed so bitter, you know?

28:55.179 --> 28:57.586
Bitter? She wasn't bitter,
she was pissed.

29:00.353 --> 29:04.042
I mean, I would be
if I'd lost everything.

29:04.564 --> 29:06.028
Just wasn't like her.

29:06.128 --> 29:08.574
Well, maybe she was Ionely.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.462
Maybe she was just reaching out.

29:12.424 --> 29:14.650
And maybe she just wants
some justice.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.535
Justice?

29:16.635 --> 29:18.921
She wants revenge.

29:25.378 --> 29:28.405
There's something to be said
for revenge.

29:28.506 --> 29:30.330
Weren't you the one
advocating peace?

29:30.431 --> 29:33.519
Said you'd send me to purgatory
if I didn't agree.

29:35.002 --> 29:38.431
Well, a girl's allowed
to change her mind, right?

29:38.532 --> 29:42.542
And if Olivia's right,
and the feud can't be stopped...

29:42.903 --> 29:46.071
...then the last man standing wins.

29:46.713 --> 29:48.718
Besides...

29:49.480 --> 29:51.144
...I'll be there.

29:51.244 --> 29:53.530
You won't be alone.

29:54.252 --> 29:56.338
Why are you doing this?

29:57.661 --> 30:00.589
Because it's the right thing to do.

30:07.767 --> 30:09.893
Together, we can't lose.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.147
Are you sure this is gonna work?

30:23.247 --> 30:26.816
As long as it doesn't
make you violently ill.

30:28.982 --> 30:30.987
Side effects, you never know.

30:31.749 --> 30:33.935
Thanks for the tip.

30:34.035 --> 30:35.860
You sure it's worth the risk?

30:35.960 --> 30:37.965
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

30:40.612 --> 30:42.798
- He won't tell me.
- Tell you what?

30:42.898 --> 30:44.903
What you need the potion for.

30:47.510 --> 30:50.237
Other than to hide your secrets,
that is.

30:50.999 --> 30:54.127
What? This was all a setup?
This isn't even legit?

30:54.488 --> 30:56.714
It's legit, all right.

30:56.814 --> 31:01.466
But I'm afraid you have to answer
to a higher power now.

31:04.794 --> 31:07.481
Go ahead, take it.
It wasn't for me anyway.

31:07.802 --> 31:10.028
- Really?
- I got it for the sisters.

31:10.128 --> 31:12.595
Phoebe's new power's wreaking
havoc on their relationship...

31:12.695 --> 31:13.958
...or haven't you noticed?

31:14.058 --> 31:16.986
You expect me to believe this
wasn't meant to protect your secrets?

31:17.307 --> 31:18.450
No, I don't.

31:18.550 --> 31:20.816
But seeing as how you haven't
figured me out yet,

31:20.916 --> 31:22.300
why would I even need it?

31:22.400 --> 31:24.405
Don't get too cocky, kid.

31:26.090 --> 31:28.616
Wouldn't want me to clip
your wings now, would you?

31:30.661 --> 31:33.228
Looks like Wyatt needs
another babysitter, Dad.

31:35.795 --> 31:38.441
All right, how fast can you make
another one?

31:40.407 --> 31:43.294
Take it, don't be afraid.

31:44.497 --> 31:46.502
You can do it.

31:47.786 --> 31:49.791
They're attacking!

32:33.865 --> 32:35.870
Think she needs help now?

32:50.067 --> 32:52.072
Mom!

33:21.147 --> 33:23.152
Richard?

33:24.435 --> 33:26.501
Richard, please wake up.

33:26.601 --> 33:29.007
Richard, please wake up.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.413
It's me, it's Olivia.

33:32.977 --> 33:34.983
Oh, no.

33:38.432 --> 33:42.081
If I can't have him in life,
I'm gonna have him in death.

33:47.254 --> 33:50.583
Oh, Richard. Richard!

33:59.326 --> 34:01.331
It's okay.

34:01.692 --> 34:04.499
You're all right, sweetheart.

34:05.100 --> 34:08.148
We couldn't be together before.

34:09.753 --> 34:12.438
We can be together now.

34:16.811 --> 34:18.815
No!

34:27.378 --> 34:29.382
Don't fight it.

34:29.784 --> 34:31.288
Just breathe.

34:31.388 --> 34:35.158
Olivia, please don't do this to me.

34:36.482 --> 34:38.928
It's the only way.

34:39.369 --> 34:42.737
It's the only way we can be together.

34:43.299 --> 34:45.705
Dying's not so hard.

34:46.748 --> 34:48.753
That's it.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.927
Just breathe.

35:01.867 --> 35:06.640
<i>Blood to blood, I summon thee</i>
<i>Blood to blood, return to me</i>

35:07.562 --> 35:09.908
- It's not working.
- Neither is scrying.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.074
I knew I should have
followed my instincts.

35:12.174 --> 35:14.219
I knew that she was in
over her head.

35:14.540 --> 35:15.643
- Phoebe...
- What?

35:15.743 --> 35:17.929
I know I'm driving everyone crazy
with my power,

35:18.029 --> 35:19.733
but it doesn't mean I'm not right.

35:19.834 --> 35:22.882
We're all tense, but that's not gonna
help us get Paige back.

35:23.242 --> 35:25.508
What is? It's like
she doesn't even exist anymore.

35:25.609 --> 35:28.857
Well, that's because Olivia's energy
is suppressing hers.

35:29.218 --> 35:31.363
So maybe we should be
scrying for Olivia.

35:31.464 --> 35:34.431
Only we'd need something of hers
to scry with.

35:42.572 --> 35:44.477
We think we know where they are.

35:44.578 --> 35:48.468
We want to help end this
before we lose anyone else.

35:50.513 --> 35:52.518
Come on in.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.314
You're too late.

36:14.415 --> 36:16.420
No, we're not.

36:17.182 --> 36:19.187
- Paige.
- I'm okay.

36:25.323 --> 36:27.609
- Phoebe, the potion.
- You don't need to banish her.

36:29.093 --> 36:33.023
No, you felt her anger
but I felt her pain.

36:35.108 --> 36:37.615
I know how much you loved him.

36:37.715 --> 36:40.602
How much it hurts to have lost him.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.111
You have to let him live.

36:44.212 --> 36:46.658
It's the only way for you
to move on and get out of limbo.

36:47.500 --> 36:50.789
Olivia, please,
come away from vengeance

36:51.110 --> 36:55.320
and come back to forgiveness,
back to who you were.

36:57.446 --> 37:00.253
Just let the feud end with life
and not with death.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.806
I'm scared.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.653
I know.

37:23.714 --> 37:25.719
Forgive me.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.585
Come on, you can't stay
in there forever.

38:14.686 --> 38:16.310
Yes, I can.

38:16.410 --> 38:18.876
Phoebe, this is nuts. Open the door.

38:18.977 --> 38:20.561
- No.
- Phoebe!

38:20.661 --> 38:22.365
Okay, let's see if this one works.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.130
<i>In the name of the Halliwell line</i>

38:24.230 --> 38:26.215
<i>Bar my sisters</i>
<i>From this power of mine</i>

38:26.316 --> 38:28.581
- Phoebe.
- Phoebe!

38:28.682 --> 38:31.549
It's not working,
I can still feel your frustration.

38:31.649 --> 38:34.016
- I don't know what else to do.
- Hey.

38:35.419 --> 38:37.244
People lock doors for a reason.

38:37.344 --> 38:40.171
I figure if you can use your powers
to intrude on my life,

38:40.272 --> 38:42.377
then I can use mine to intrude
on yours.

38:42.477 --> 38:45.265
Phoebe, none of us like this new
power of yours any more than you.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.510
But it's pointless to isolate yourself.

38:47.611 --> 38:49.796
Well, if I can't read you,
I can't hurt you.

38:49.897 --> 38:54.107
How about instead of trying to control
your power, you control yourself?

38:54.468 --> 38:55.852
Because, Paige, I can't.

38:55.952 --> 38:58.519
I can sense how annoyed you
are and that's hurting me.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.647
What's annoying me is I discovered
I have this magical destiny

39:01.968 --> 39:05.036
and I can't trust you to leave me
alone for me to follow it.

39:05.136 --> 39:06.921
What do you think I'm trying to do?

39:07.021 --> 39:08.725
Let's look at the bright side.

39:08.825 --> 39:12.294
We settled a family feud,
we set free a tortured soul,

39:12.395 --> 39:15.723
maybe your new power
and Paige's new solo path

39:16.044 --> 39:19.192
away from the sisterhood
is some kind of synergy,

39:19.293 --> 39:22.701
that it's all working together
in some kind of divine way.

39:23.062 --> 39:25.067
- Nah.
- Nah.

39:25.388 --> 39:27.634
Leo didn't give you
the empath-blocking potion?

39:27.955 --> 39:29.940
What potion?

39:30.040 --> 39:32.045
Leo!

39:32.968 --> 39:35.013
- Where is it?
- Give me, give me, give me...

39:35.334 --> 39:36.918
- Faster.
- Come on, come on.

39:37.018 --> 39:39.003
They're anxious about that potion.

39:39.104 --> 39:42.914
I think you should wait. Phoebe
was given her power for a reason...

39:43.315 --> 39:45.320
Forget that.

40:02.043 --> 40:04.850
Nothing. Nada. Zilch.

40:05.171 --> 40:07.617
- Yes.
- Hallelujah!

40:07.938 --> 40:11.127
I have to go finish a game
of pinochle with Grandma Callaway.

40:11.227 --> 40:13.713
- Maybe you'll run into Richard.
- I'm sorry?

40:14.034 --> 40:16.962
That was a sister thing,
not an empath thing.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.348
Come on.

40:19.448 --> 40:21.553
So it worked, right?

40:21.654 --> 40:23.940
No nausea, no queasiness,
nothing like that?

40:24.782 --> 40:26.787
Nope, nothing.

40:30.156 --> 40:33.043
Well, it looks like we're one, big,
happy family again.

40:34.006 --> 40:36.011
You're not family.

40:46.959 --> 40:49.145
Piper?

40:49.245 --> 40:52.694
I... I want to apologize.

40:53.015 --> 40:54.559
For what?

40:54.659 --> 40:56.845
For being...

40:56.945 --> 40:58.409
...around so much.

40:58.509 --> 41:01.757
I know you asked for your space
and I want to honour that but it's just...

41:02.078 --> 41:04.023
Yeah. No, I understand.

41:04.123 --> 41:06.490
- I'm not upset.
- Good.

41:07.171 --> 41:09.558
I don't really think it's necessary
anymore.

41:09.658 --> 41:13.307
Besides, I can't think of a better
babysitter for Wyatt than his daddy.

41:14.230 --> 41:16.255
Really?

41:16.355 --> 41:18.501
Anytime.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.528
I know this hasn't been easy
for you, either.

41:21.849 --> 41:23.233
But I really appreciate it.

41:23.333 --> 41:25.820
It's given me some time to think.

41:26.140 --> 41:27.283
About?

41:27.384 --> 41:29.870
About where we go from here.

41:30.913 --> 41:34.041
And I think it's time
maybe we make it official.

41:35.926 --> 41:38.171
You know, legal.

41:42.984 --> 41:44.127
I understand.

41:44.227 --> 41:46.232
Piper, Seth's on the phone.

41:49.922 --> 41:51.506
Guess you better get that.

41:51.606 --> 41:53.611
Yeah.
