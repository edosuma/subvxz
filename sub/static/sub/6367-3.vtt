You getting any more time for it?

01:06.083 --> 01:08.380
They just let me off with a warning.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.988
Take it seriously.
They'll just keep you in here longer.

01:12.021 --> 01:15.093
I just can't stand being in here

01:15.126 --> 01:18.397

I can't talk to them.

01:18.430 --> 01:21.797
- And then if he comes back...
- Rabbit?

01:21.830 --> 01:26.608
If he's alive,
you hurt him pretty badly.

01:27.745 --> 01:29.345
He's alive.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.348
<i>I put my kids in harm's way.</i>

01:34.389 --> 01:38.492

- We will.

01:46.165 --> 01:48.835
Hey.

01:48.868 --> 01:54.237
All that time you were inside,
I never came to see you.

01:56.510 --> 01:58.612
Thank you.

<i>Sometimes I wonder what

- No, not right now.

06:42.357 --> 06:46.060

10:07.095 --> 10:08.429
- Sheriff.
- Mr. Bowman.

10:08.462 --> 10:11.966
My son Solomon, he never
came home last night.

10:11.999 --> 10:14.471
Whoever did this might have
done the same thing to him.

10:14.504 --> 10:17.238
<i>All right, Mr. Bowman, I assure
you every effort will be made.</i>

10:17.271 --> 10:19.877
But you can help us by asking
your people who saw Solomon last.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.510
<i>- Okay?
- I don't know.</i>

10:21.543 --> 10:23.078
<i>All right, thank you.
I understand.</i>

10:23.111 --> 10:25.677
<i>Right now I need you
to please step back.</i>

10:26.782 --> 10:28.918
<i>- There's no connection?
- No.</i>

10:28.951 --> 10:31.319
Tell him.

10:31.352 --> 10:36.427
Just tell him what you told me.
Now, come on. Now.

10:36.467 --> 10:40.526
Lana was hooking up with an Amish kid.

10:41.734 --> 10:45.198
- What Amish kid? What's his name?
- Solomon Bowman.

10:45.231 --> 10:48.806
- What?
- This is... this is a... this is a lie.

10:48.839 --> 10:50.470
This is a damned lie!

10:50.511 --> 10:53.006
My son had no dealings
with Indian girls.

10:53.047 --> 10:55.277
<i>- So where is the boy?
- He's not here.</i>

10:55.310 --> 10:57.276
He's missing. The boy is missing.

10:57.309 --> 10:59.643
They're hiding the boy.
You're hiding the boy!

10:59.684 --> 11:01.546
<i>Why do you say this?
I am not hiding him.</i>

11:01.579 --> 11:04.314
<i>He's hiding the boy.
Bring the boy here.</i>

11:04.347 --> 11:07.384
<i>I will not bring the boy here.
He has nothing to answer for.</i>

11:07.417 --> 11:09.048
<i>- He killed her.
- Why does he say this?</i>

11:09.089 --> 11:11.993
Both of you just back off now!

11:13.259 --> 11:14.962
- If you're hiding him...
- What? No. What?

11:14.995 --> 11:17.197
<i>- I do not know where he is.
- He killed my baby!</i>

11:17.230 --> 11:19.736
<i>I tell you he did not kill anyone.</i>

11:19.769 --> 11:23.377
<i>He killed her!
He killed my baby!</i>

11:23.410 --> 11:27.011
<i>Mr. Cleary. Mr. Cleary.</i>

11:27.051 --> 11:28.915
<i>- Mr. Cleary.
- Please stay back, okay?</i>

11:28.948 --> 11:30.987
I have to find my son.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.577
The State is sending more
troopers to comb the area.

11:47.610 --> 11:49.881
Okay.

11:49.914 --> 11:52.050
<i>Thanks.</i>

11:56.251 --> 11:59.121
Hey, who's the big guy?

12:01.153 --> 12:04.220
<i>Oh, that's Chayton.</i>

12:04.253 --> 12:07.388
He's head of the Redbones,
a gang on the reservation.

12:07.421 --> 12:11.428
Real bad news.
Did some time a while back.

12:11.461 --> 12:13.458
<i>Beat the living shit out
of a busload of tourists</i>

12:13.499 --> 12:15.362
<i>because some of them
were dressed like Indians.</i>

12:15.395 --> 12:17.564
<i>Came out bigger and meaner
than when he went in.</i>

12:17.605 --> 12:21.199
<i>- You guys bust him?
- No, staties got him.</i>

12:21.232 --> 12:23.674
<i>Me and Brock tried to
arrest him a while back.</i>

12:23.707 --> 12:26.012
- You tried?
- He's a large man.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.518
Siobhan.

12:42.028 --> 12:45.696
Keep your finger along the trigger
guard until you're ready to shoot.

12:47.001 --> 12:49.735
Good. Wide stance.

12:49.768 --> 12:54.145
Good. Good.
Now let's see what you can do.

12:57.345 --> 12:59.615
<i>That's very good.</i>

13:01.416 --> 13:03.518
Excuse me.

13:14.697 --> 13:16.799
<i>Solomon?</i>

13:21.531 --> 13:23.897
<i>Solomon! Solomon!</i>

13:23.930 --> 13:26.167
<i>Solomon!</i>

13:27.335 --> 13:30.472
<i>- Solomon!
- Solomon, can you hear me?</i>

13:30.505 --> 13:32.305
<i>Solomon!</i>

13:38.252 --> 13:40.917
<i>- Solomon!
- Solomon!</i>

13:40.950 --> 13:42.318
<i>Solomon!</i>

14:16.700 --> 14:19.267
<i>Hold on a moment, okay?</i>

14:27.711 --> 14:29.477
- Yeah?
- Sheriff.

14:29.510 --> 14:31.747
Have you heard anything
about my brother?

14:31.780 --> 14:33.812
Uh, no. Not yet.

14:33.845 --> 14:37.184
State troopers are helping with
the search, but there's nothing yet.

14:38.857 --> 14:42.658
- Do you have any idea where he might be?
- Solomon's not a killer.

14:42.699 --> 14:45.034
There's a lot of people
who believe he is.

14:45.068 --> 14:47.834
That's why we need
to find him before the Kinaho do.

14:47.867 --> 14:50.833
If I can be of any help,
Sheriff, any help at all.

14:50.874 --> 14:54.843
- Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
- Good.

14:56.179 --> 14:58.747
Let's go, Rebecca.
Let the sheriff do his job.

14:59.644 --> 15:01.317
<i>Come on.</i>

15:07.389 --> 15:11.796
Please.
Just bring him back to me.

15:22.266 --> 15:24.137
Rebecca Bowman have anything to add?

15:24.169 --> 15:28.333
- No.
- I think I got something from the sister.

15:28.374 --> 15:31.240
Lana Cleary had an ex-boyfriend,
a guy named Tommy Littlestone.

15:31.273 --> 15:34.346
Apparently, when he found out she was
dating an Amish kid, he went off on her.

15:34.379 --> 15:37.218
- Started sending her threatening e-mails.
- Tommy Littlestone?

15:37.251 --> 15:39.487
- Any relation to Chayton Littlestone?
- It's his little brother.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.918
What, Chayton, the big
guy from the crime scene?

15:41.951 --> 15:44.552
Yeah. Chayton isn't
some meathead gangbanger.

15:44.593 --> 15:47.760
He's old school. He's all about
the purity of the Kinaho tribe.

15:47.793 --> 15:50.263
<i>In fact, none of the Redbones
date outside the tribe.</i>

15:50.297 --> 15:52.864
So my guess is if his little
brother's girl was involved

15:52.897 --> 15:55.832
with some Amish boy, that
wouldn't have gone over so well.

15:55.865 --> 15:57.367
<i>Yeah, and according to Lana's sister,</i>

15:57.400 --> 15:59.808
Tommy's now a full-fledged
member of the Redbones.

15:59.841 --> 16:03.076
I guess we need to have a little
chat with Tommy Littlestone.

16:03.117 --> 16:04.716
We have no jurisdiction
on the reservation.

16:04.749 --> 16:08.179
We cannot take one step onto their
land without a federal warrant.

16:08.220 --> 16:10.190
<i> Exactly.</i>

16:10.223 --> 16:12.759
- What?
- Nothing.

16:12.792 --> 16:14.190
Just wondering which one of us

16:14.223 --> 16:17.548
has the best relationship
with the FBI these days.

16:19.899 --> 16:22.602
That's what I thought.
Let's go.

16:23.538 --> 16:27.073
What?
Hood. Hood! Hey!

17:21.838 --> 17:25.239
- We should rethink this.
- I agree.

17:25.271 --> 17:28.876
- We expecting trouble?
- We don't have jurisdiction here, all right?

17:28.909 --> 17:30.338
<i>Some of these kids are minors.</i>

17:30.371 --> 17:32.877
We pull our guns, we
could all go down for it.

17:32.910 --> 17:35.746
- Okay, so no guns.
- Yeah, but if Chayton is in there...

17:35.779 --> 17:38.049
We should probably have a talk with him.

17:38.082 --> 17:41.016
<i>Where's he going?
Where are you going?</i>

17:41.049 --> 17:43.648
I'm gonna go around back,
poke around a little.

17:44.584 --> 17:46.319
<i>Okay.</i>

17:46.352 --> 17:48.622
He's gonna poke around.

17:48.655 --> 17:52.192
<i>Bring your Tasers.
Shit.</i>

18:10.981 --> 18:13.283
<i>Heads up, guys. There's cops.</i>

18:19.827 --> 18:23.059
<i>Good afternoon.
Banshee County Sheriff's Department.</i>

18:23.092 --> 18:24.930
We can see who you are, man.

18:24.963 --> 18:27.959
- Look, we just want to ask you a few questions.
- Go fuck yourself, bitch.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.797
One of our girls was killed on
Amish land and you're landing on us?

18:30.830 --> 18:34.331
- Typical racist white man bullshit.
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.899
Look, nobody's accusing
you guys of anything.

18:35.932 --> 18:37.374
We're just trying to
figure this thing out.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.607
Figure it out somewhere else.

18:38.641 --> 18:40.775
This is the rez, man.
You're trespassing.

18:40.808 --> 18:43.408
Look, son, I don't want to argue
the finer points of the law with you,

18:43.449 --> 18:45.744
<i>but we are investigating a
potential capital murder case.</i>

18:45.785 --> 18:48.186
- So we have jurisdiction.
- We have jurisdiction?

18:48.220 --> 18:50.386
- Just go with it, okay?
- Get the fuck out.

18:53.596 --> 18:54.828
<i>Fucking cops.</i>

19:14.331 --> 19:15.827
We're looking for Tommy Littlestone.

19:15.867 --> 19:19.003
<i>- We just want to talk to him.
- Look, you guys can talk to us here</i>

19:19.036 --> 19:21.002
or you can talk to us from
a holding cell. Your choice.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.709
Why don't you go find the Amish
motherfucker who killed her?

19:23.742 --> 19:26.312
Get the fuck out of here.

19:36.487 --> 19:39.357
- Hi.
- How the fuck did you get in here?

19:39.390 --> 19:41.156
Hey, take it easy.
Take it easy.

19:41.189 --> 19:43.829
<i>This is a friendly visit.
I just want to talk.</i>

19:43.862 --> 19:45.863
I'm not looking for any trouble, okay?

19:45.896 --> 19:49.734
No? Well, it looks like
trouble is what you got.

19:56.946 --> 20:00.814
- You're Chayton Littlestone.
- Just Chayton.

20:00.847 --> 20:05.583
Well, Chayton,
I was just telling your colleagues here

20:05.616 --> 20:07.821
I just want to talk.

20:07.854 --> 20:10.249
You got no business
being on the rez, cop.

20:10.283 --> 20:11.922
Well, that's something
we can talk about.

20:11.955 --> 20:14.154
<i>Far as I'm concerned,
you have no authority</i>

20:14.227 --> 20:17.119
<i>on or off the reservation.</i>

20:17.160 --> 20:20.188
You see, all the land around here

20:20.221 --> 20:24.122
was Kinaho land before
the white man ever sailed.

20:24.155 --> 20:26.624
And then your forefathers stole it,

20:26.657 --> 20:30.268
parceled it up and sold it
as if they were entitled.

20:30.301 --> 20:33.067
<i>Just like you feel entitled
to walk into my house</i>

20:33.100 --> 20:35.706
because you wear that
piece of polished tin.

20:35.739 --> 20:38.674
And now a red girl has been
killed on white man's land

20:38.707 --> 20:41.409
that should have rightfully
belonged to her people to begin with

20:41.442 --> 20:43.873
and you...

20:43.914 --> 20:45.810
you don't see the audacity it takes

20:45.851 --> 20:48.145
for you to turn up
here pointing fingers?

20:48.186 --> 20:50.648
I'm trying to find out
who killed that girl.

20:50.682 --> 20:53.288
You won't find that here.

20:54.383 --> 20:58.885
If you didn't kill her,
then you got nothing to worry about.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.559
Do I look worried?

21:06.093 --> 21:08.195
<i>- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck.</i>

21:08.258 --> 21:10.832
Shit, Hood's in there.

21:10.865 --> 21:13.696
<i>- Open up!
- Kick his ass!</i>

21:19.271 --> 21:20.967
Hit it, Emmett. Hit it.

21:25.312 --> 21:27.912
Knock him out!

21:29.945 --> 21:31.983
- Fuck this.
- Watch out. Watch out.

21:37.923 --> 21:39.260
Get off!

21:52.278 --> 21:53.909
<i>Hey, get off me, man!</i>

21:56.716 --> 21:58.283
<i>No! Hold still!</i>

22:02.914 --> 22:04.721
<i>Let me go, man. 
Let me go!</i>

22:04.754 --> 22:06.720
<i>- Put your hands up!
- Put your hands up!</i>

22:06.753 --> 22:07.815
<i>Put your hands up!
Turn around!</i>

22:07.856 --> 22:09.788
<i>Turn around!</i>

22:15.662 --> 22:18.764
<i>Don't move.
Don't move.</i>

22:29.269 --> 22:31.604
<i>- On your knees!
- Stay down! Shut up!</i>

22:41.773 --> 22:43.980
You're gonna bleed with me, cop.

22:44.013 --> 22:46.485
Just like your ancestors bled with mine.

22:46.518 --> 22:47.716
Hood!

23:00.932 --> 23:02.161
Hey!

23:46.956 --> 23:50.026
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.665
Everything all right in here?

23:57.836 --> 24:02.504
Okay, which one of you assholes
is Tommy Littlestone?

24:09.207 --> 24:11.142
Hey, Tommy.

24:11.175 --> 24:13.646
Guess your brother ate
all the vitamins, huh?

24:41.286 --> 24:45.886
- Ow!
- Baby.

24:52.401 --> 24:55.066
Thanks for saving my ass back there.

24:57.068 --> 25:01.170
Guy was about five seconds
away from tearing me apart.

25:03.809 --> 25:05.912
Well, we can't have that.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.476
Not when things are
just getting interesting.

25:12.714 --> 25:14.747
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.617
I'd like to see Sheriff Hood.

25:16.650 --> 25:19.781
The sheriff is busy right now,
but who can I tell him is here?

25:21.181 --> 25:22.613
Jason.

25:22.654 --> 25:24.885
Do you got a last name like most people?

25:24.918 --> 25:29.354
- Uh, Smith.
- Have a seat, Smith.

25:29.387 --> 25:31.587
I'll let the sheriff
know that you're here.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.666
So...

25:53.707 --> 25:57.706
I got you on resisting arrest,

25:57.739 --> 26:00.104
assaulting a police officer,

26:00.145 --> 26:01.712
carrying a concealed weapon,

26:01.745 --> 26:03.846
trying to slice me open
with that concealed weapon.

26:03.879 --> 26:06.815
I could put you away for
10 years on those alone.

26:07.953 --> 26:09.449
But I'll bet

26:09.489 --> 26:11.783
I could also make you good
for the girl's murder.

26:14.024 --> 26:16.623
I don't kill Indians.

26:16.656 --> 26:20.988
<i>No?
What about your brother?</i>

26:21.028 --> 26:24.366
You came onto the rez
without a federal warrant.

26:24.399 --> 26:25.966
These arrests are illegal.

26:25.999 --> 26:29.533
Yeah, see, you guys all say this
to me like I should give a shit.

26:29.566 --> 26:31.638
If you give a shit about the dead girl,

26:31.671 --> 26:34.405
seems to me you should
be looking for the Amish kid.

26:37.573 --> 26:42.882
So you got nothing to tell
me about Lana and Tommy?

26:46.715 --> 26:51.321
I'll see you again, cop,
outside this cage.

26:56.655 --> 26:59.095
Ever the optimist.

27:08.429 --> 27:10.099
<i>So what?
So I sent her some e-mails.</i>

27:10.132 --> 27:11.900
<i>It doesn't mean anything.
I didn't do anything!</i>

27:11.933 --> 27:16.008
Sheriff Hood.
Your deputy just gave us the rundown.

27:16.041 --> 27:20.510
- Alison Medding.
- Ah, the new ADA, right?

27:20.550 --> 27:23.013
That's right. With Gordon
filling the Mayor's slot,

27:23.085 --> 27:24.612
<i>I will be running point on this.</i>

27:24.653 --> 27:26.148
What does that mean exactly?

27:26.181 --> 27:28.717
It means it's my job to tell
you that you had no authority

27:28.758 --> 27:30.651
to go into Kinaho land and
start shaking people down.

27:30.684 --> 27:32.089
You get straight to the point, huh?

27:32.122 --> 27:33.691
- We have a murdered girl.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

27:33.724 --> 27:36.360
And if this investigation is
compromised by illegal arrests...

27:36.393 --> 27:38.655
- Jesus Christ. Listen to you.
- ...you'll blow the whole thing before it gets started.

27:38.696 --> 27:40.391
While you're standing
here worrying about rules,

27:40.424 --> 27:42.495
I'm out there trying to
find the guy who did this.

27:42.528 --> 27:43.928
Hey, hey. That's enough.

27:43.968 --> 27:47.707
Now, do you have anything solid
tying these men to the girl's murder?

27:49.035 --> 27:50.640
Well, when I asked him
if he killed the girl,

27:50.673 --> 27:52.208
the big one tried to kill me.

27:52.241 --> 27:54.038
Well, that's not exactly
conclusive now, is it?

27:54.071 --> 27:56.036
<i>Tommy Littlestone is 17 years old.</i>

27:56.076 --> 27:58.139
You're questioning a minor
without representation.

27:58.172 --> 28:00.507
<i>Not to mention your arrests
were illegal to begin with</i>

28:00.540 --> 28:02.946
- because you were out of your jurisdiction.
- You two should meet.

28:02.979 --> 28:05.514
Chayton Littlestone has two
warrants in Jefferson County.

28:05.547 --> 28:07.347
<i>Probably why he resisted today.</i>

28:07.380 --> 28:10.955
They have priority, so I'm having him
transferred back to their jurisdiction.

28:10.988 --> 28:13.057
Believe me, they're welcome to him.

28:13.090 --> 28:15.224
<i>You can take the little brother now.</i>

28:15.257 --> 28:17.489
Let's go.

28:17.522 --> 28:19.993
<i>Tommy. Tommy. Don't say another
word. I'm shutting this down.</i>

28:20.026 --> 28:22.430
<i>- Come with us.
- We're not holding him any longer.</i>

28:22.463 --> 28:24.599
- This your first murder case?
- It is.

28:24.632 --> 28:29.334
- Big career boost, huh?
- Damn straight. I plan to crush it.

28:29.367 --> 28:32.102
My boss doesn't like you.

28:32.135 --> 28:35.091
Don't be ridiculous.
Everyone likes me.

28:38.737 --> 28:42.177
- Sheriff Hood.
- Yeah?

28:42.210 --> 28:44.479
I've got something
you might want to hear.

28:44.512 --> 28:49.012
- Uh... What?
- Someplace private we can talk?

28:50.045 --> 28:52.415
<i>- You know?
- Yeah.</i>

28:54.917 --> 28:56.854
It's crazy out there today, huh?

28:56.887 --> 28:59.589
- Is it always like that?
- You got something to tell me?

29:08.302 --> 29:12.934
- You're not my father.
- No, that's very true.

29:12.967 --> 29:16.741
Yeah, but...
see, you have his name.

29:18.975 --> 29:21.477
<i>I don't think I introduced myself.</i>

29:21.511 --> 29:23.615
I'm Jason Hood.

29:25.488 --> 29:27.824
<i>I don't know who you are, but </i>

29:27.857 --> 29:31.392
you're not Lucas Hood.

29:34.793 --> 29:36.429
What do you want?

29:36.462 --> 29:39.659
<i>Well, for starters, where's my father?</i>

29:39.692 --> 29:41.825
Your father is dead.

29:43.098 --> 29:48.432
- I figured. Did you kill him?
- No.

29:48.459 --> 29:49.970
Why should I believe you?

29:58.710 --> 30:03.679
I have no reason to lie to you.
You already got me nailed.

30:06.382 --> 30:08.347
You don't seem too worried about that.

30:08.380 --> 30:12.417
<i>You don't seem too broken up for a guy
who just learned his father's dead.</i>

30:12.450 --> 30:15.838
- We weren't very close.
- If it makes you feel any better,

30:15.839 --> 30:20.530
- he died doing the right thing.
- Thanks. It doesn't.

30:20.563 --> 30:23.328
Yeah, I had a father like that, too.

30:29.369 --> 30:33.769
So what's stopping me from just
walking out that door right now

30:33.810 --> 30:36.273
and blowing your shit out of the water?

30:40.549 --> 30:43.018
If you really think I'm the
guy who killed your father,

30:43.051 --> 30:47.120
a cop, in cold blood, then had
the balls to steal his identity,

30:47.153 --> 30:51.292
do you really think it's a smart
idea to sit there and threaten me?

31:18.023 --> 31:20.024
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

31:20.897 --> 31:23.363
I'm fucking starving.

31:49.717 --> 31:51.787
<i>I'll talk to her.</i>

32:06.110 --> 32:08.119
<i>Hello, Miriam.</i>

32:11.289 --> 32:14.855
You allowed the elders to
send your only daughter away

32:14.888 --> 32:19.124
with nowhere to go.
She would have ended up in the streets.

32:19.189 --> 32:23.295
But I was there to put a roof
over her head and feed her.

32:23.335 --> 32:26.765
As I think
you knew I would be, right?

32:28.334 --> 32:30.733
And now...

32:30.774 --> 32:34.077
could it really be that you'd
just rather hang your laundry

32:34.110 --> 32:37.377
and leave your son to
die than speak to me,

32:37.418 --> 32:40.417
the only person who
might be able to help?

32:45.488 --> 32:46.591
Patia!

33:09.747 --> 33:11.852
<i>- Walk to the house.
- To the house.</i>

33:25.337 --> 33:27.206
<i>We want the boy.</i>

33:30.270 --> 33:32.574
<i>Patia. Patia, wait, please.</i>

33:32.607 --> 33:33.976
<i>- I can't talk to you.
- Please.</i>

33:34.017 --> 33:36.913
Look, you can think
whatever you want about me,

33:36.954 --> 33:41.320
but you and Solomon grew up together
and I know you care for him.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.624
- You've got to help me.
- No, I can't help you.

33:43.657 --> 33:45.655
You can and you will.

33:45.688 --> 33:48.790
Is it true about Solomon
and the Indian girl?

33:50.833 --> 33:53.601
You know that little bridge in the
woods where the boys used to fish?

33:53.634 --> 33:56.368
- Yes.  - Go there and I'll meet
you there as soon as I can.

33:56.402 --> 33:59.369
Thank you. Thank you.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.778
<i>Fucking cham!</i>

34:07.818 --> 34:09.283
Kai, no.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.882
<i>Get over here, you bun runner.</i>

34:13.417 --> 34:17.992
Blessed are the peacemakers
that they will be called sons of God.

34:18.025 --> 34:20.257
<i>Come on, you fucking Dutchy!</i>

34:20.299 --> 34:23.264
<i>- Don't.
- Kai, don't.</i>

34:23.297 --> 34:25.929
<i>That's it, come on, you bitch.</i>

34:29.306 --> 34:32.273
You're all brave men

34:32.306 --> 34:35.208
intimidating people you
know won't fight back.

34:35.242 --> 34:38.478
I'll give you 30 seconds to get
back into your trucks and go.

34:41.478 --> 34:46.655
No, what I'm thinking is
I'm gonna take this bat

34:46.688 --> 34:49.855
and shove it up your bitch
ass and see how you like that.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.592
<i>- Show him.
- I see.</i>

34:58.402 --> 35:01.033
- Oh!
- Fuck!

35:01.066 --> 35:02.537
Let's go. Be strong, man.

35:02.570 --> 35:03.601
Come on, right here.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.547
<i>- He's going nuts.
- Hold up, hold up.</i>

35:07.580 --> 35:09.345
<i>Get in there.</i>

35:09.378 --> 35:11.609
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, wait.</i>

35:11.649 --> 35:14.383
<i>- Crazy.
- Crazy.</i>

35:14.448 --> 35:15.846
Do you know what's worse than getting

35:15.879 --> 35:18.283
your testicles crushed
with a baseball bat?

35:18.316 --> 35:20.178
Getting them crushed again.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.344
Oh!

35:35.026 --> 35:37.033
Go home.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.671
<i>We're coming back for you, Dutchy.</i>

35:42.704 --> 35:45.275
Are you hiding the boy?
'Cause if you are...

35:45.308 --> 35:47.577
<i>You dare speak to me like this?</i>

35:47.611 --> 35:50.975
<i>As if I would do such a thing.</i>

35:51.008 --> 35:54.214
<i>Your insolence is beyond contempt.</i>

36:10.219 --> 36:12.339
<i>Mother.</i>

36:13.077 --> 36:14.459
Kai.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.736
<i>Leah.</i>

36:30.514 --> 36:34.144
To the Lord our God belong
mercies and forgiveness

36:34.177 --> 36:36.981
though we have sinned against him.

36:37.015 --> 36:40.010
This is about the life
of your grandchild.

36:40.051 --> 36:43.987
If Kai can help, I will
not be the one to stop him.

36:51.632 --> 36:53.663
<i>Mother.</i>

37:12.414 --> 37:14.285
<i>So these guys killed my father</i>

37:14.318 --> 37:17.620
and then you just killed them
and figured what the hell,

37:17.653 --> 37:20.557
I always wanted to be a sheriff?

37:20.590 --> 37:23.796
Let's just say I needed
to become someone else

37:23.829 --> 37:28.196
and the opportunity presented itself.
Your turn.

37:28.229 --> 37:31.206
Well, I was working for
these guys out in Portland.

37:31.239 --> 37:34.140
- What kind of guys?
- Pretty much what you think.

37:34.173 --> 37:37.175
You know, bad guys,
bad-tempered, bad drugs.

37:37.208 --> 37:40.284
Things got uncool and I
decided it was time to split.

37:40.318 --> 37:42.717
And they sent some asshole
after me back in Nevada.

37:42.758 --> 37:44.423
They sent someone after you?

37:44.456 --> 37:48.262
<i>That means you either took
something that didn't belong to you</i>

37:48.295 --> 37:50.831
or you fucked someone
that didn't belong to you.

37:50.864 --> 37:53.598
Yeah...
one of those things.

37:54.671 --> 37:59.467
- You boys need anything more?
- You got any pie?

37:59.500 --> 38:01.769
<i>Look around you, son.</i>

38:01.802 --> 38:05.670
Does this look like the kind
of place that serves pie?

38:05.704 --> 38:08.605
- Thanks, Sugar.
- We're good.

38:08.606 --> 38:11.510
- How good?
- Good enough.

38:16.319 --> 38:17.812
Here's what I'm thinking.

38:17.845 --> 38:21.688
<i>You got everyone here believing
that you're Lucas Hood, right?</i>

38:21.721 --> 38:23.455
<i>That takes some doing.</i>

38:23.488 --> 38:27.525
<i>There's identification, social security,
credit card numbers, the works.</i>

38:27.558 --> 38:32.092
- Do you know how to do all that?
- I know a guy.

38:32.133 --> 38:36.233
I'm thinking of just... disappearing.

38:36.266 --> 38:38.434
<i>You know, like going up to Canada</i>

38:38.467 --> 38:41.171
<i>and maybe get work
with the fishing fleets.</i>

38:43.973 --> 38:45.812
I just... I don't...

38:45.845 --> 38:49.114
I don't want to be looking over my
shoulder for the rest of my life.

38:58.954 --> 39:01.458
Yeah, I can help you out.

39:03.494 --> 39:05.334
But it's gonna take a few days.

39:05.367 --> 39:08.435
So in the meantime, I'm gonna
need you to lay low for a while.

39:08.468 --> 39:09.898
You understand?

39:09.931 --> 39:11.972
That's one of the few
skill sets I do possess.

39:12.005 --> 39:14.310
Shut up!
You're gonna check in

39:14.343 --> 39:16.176
to the Valley Motel and
you're gonna stay there.

39:16.209 --> 39:18.247
I don't want to see
your face around town.

39:18.280 --> 39:22.586
I'll come to you.
We do the thing, then you say good-bye.

39:22.619 --> 39:27.890
You go off, start your new life.
And you do not come back.

39:32.163 --> 39:33.965
Hey, where you going?

39:33.998 --> 39:36.134
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm a little busy.

39:36.174 --> 39:40.375
- You mean you actually do the job?
- Now and then.

39:44.711 --> 39:47.077
<i>He just leave me with the check?</i>

39:47.118 --> 39:52.354
- It's on the house.
- Well, thanks for lunch.

39:52.395 --> 39:55.095
- What the fuck?!
- Sit down.

39:55.128 --> 39:58.067
Ah, I'm fucking bleeding.

39:59.004 --> 40:01.300
Pay attention.

40:02.637 --> 40:08.439
I saw your father die right over there.
He didn't deserve it.

40:08.472 --> 40:11.743
And the man who just
walked out this door,

40:11.776 --> 40:14.046
he killed the men who did it.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.213
Now, you may find this hard to believe,

40:17.246 --> 40:20.314
given his winning personality,

40:20.347 --> 40:24.184
but the man actually has friends here.

40:24.217 --> 40:28.846
Good friends,
if you take my meaning.

40:28.887 --> 40:32.319
I know
because I'm one of them.

40:33.488 --> 40:38.299
<i>And if I get as much as an inkling
that you pose any threat to him,</i>

40:38.332 --> 40:44.602
I will personally turn your
father's grave into a family plot.

40:46.002 --> 40:51.007
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

40:58.050 --> 41:00.048
Let me get you a band-aid.

41:22.846 --> 41:26.484
<i>No! Get off me!</i>

41:26.517 --> 41:28.379
Get off of me!

42:11.847 --> 42:12.908
No!

42:19.650 --> 42:21.719
No! No!

42:54.287 --> 42:56.158
<i>Hey.</i>

42:58.461 --> 43:00.154
<i>You okay?</i>

43:00.227 --> 43:02.659
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

43:02.692 --> 43:05.668
Hey, hey, hey. You're okay.
What happened?

43:05.701 --> 43:08.499
- Rebecca, what happened?
- A man.

43:08.533 --> 43:11.096
- What man?
- In the woods. He attacked me.

43:22.810 --> 43:24.450
Hey!

44:05.769 --> 44:07.670
<i>What happened?</i>

44:07.703 --> 44:09.405
- Let me see that.
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

44:09.438 --> 44:10.837
You need to get that looked at.

44:10.877 --> 44:13.313
No, no. I think I might have
clipped him. We got to go back in.

44:13.346 --> 44:14.786
No, no, no, no.
No, no. Not you.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.851
- Not like this.
- We're wasting time.

44:16.884 --> 44:19.385
Brock has got the staties
combing the woods for Solomon.

44:19.418 --> 44:20.986
Whoever is in there,
they're gonna find him.

44:21.027 --> 44:22.827
<i>I'm fine.</i>

44:22.860 --> 44:25.494
When was the last time
you actually slept?

44:26.863 --> 44:29.133
<i>You've got to give it a rest.</i>

44:31.207 --> 44:35.573
- I'm gonna drive you home, okay?
- Okay.

44:50.831 --> 44:55.067
- I don't live here.
- I know.

44:55.100 --> 44:57.569
You haven't eaten anything today.

44:58.343 --> 45:00.310
I'm gonna make you something.

45:08.984 --> 45:11.687
<i>I said posse, idiot.</i>

45:40.208 --> 45:43.111
- You want some more?
- Yeah.

45:43.144 --> 45:45.384
Cheers.

45:49.922 --> 45:51.886
With everything that's happened
in the last couple of days,

45:51.919 --> 45:54.115
you know what's sticking with me?

45:56.420 --> 46:02.193
Lana's mother told me
her girl was gonna be a schoolteacher.

46:03.660 --> 46:06.361
<i>I wanted to do that once.</i>

46:07.499 --> 46:09.771
A long time ago.

46:24.585 --> 46:26.790
<i>How's your head?</i>

46:29.696 --> 46:31.664
<i>Fine.</i>

46:42.580 --> 46:45.477
<i>I should probably go.</i>

46:59.099 --> 47:01.232
You should go.

47:07.271 --> 47:09.303
