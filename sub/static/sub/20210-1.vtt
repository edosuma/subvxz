00:39.739 --> 00:43.976
- Mr. Snuffles, what do you
have to say for yourself?

00:49.382 --> 00:53.619
You're so silly.

01:04.763 --> 01:05.998
There you are.

01:15.409 --> 01:19.645
Of course not, we're the
bestest friends forever, ever.

01:25.218 --> 01:26.952
I'll always be true.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.495
- Who are you talking
with, Princess?

01:36.497 --> 01:38.897
- Just with my dolls, mommy.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.899
- Get some sleep, darling.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.469
We have a big day ahead of us.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.377
- So that went well.

03:00.547 --> 03:01.847
- Are you okay?

03:03.416 --> 03:04.416
- I'm okay.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.790
- So what did Hodges say, any
legal problems about probate?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.692
- Nope, it's all done,

03:14.994 --> 03:19.097
wrapped up in a pretty
legal bow with my signature.

03:23.436 --> 03:27.973
- I'm sorry, sweetheart,
that was inconsiderate.

03:27.975 --> 03:31.610
Where would you like to
go, anywhere, just name it.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.579
- Home, I'm going home.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.353
- Hey, miss Mason,
some of your students

04:48.355 --> 04:49.955
want to say goodbye.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.257
- Bye, we love you!

04:52.259 --> 04:53.859
Bye, miss Mason!

05:05.338 --> 05:09.508
- We're here, baby.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.679
Wake up, sleepyhead.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.515
- You know me and
long car rides.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.451
- You excited to be home?

05:27.194 --> 05:29.594
- Yeah, something like that.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.018
- Well, come in.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.592
Let's get some
lights on in here.

06:35.896 --> 06:36.896
All right.

06:39.098 --> 06:42.167
Huh.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.669
Time to buy some light bulbs.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.553
And what is behind
door number one?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.889
- Can we make sure that the
kitchen and bathroom work

07:03.891 --> 07:05.690
before we go exploring?

07:05.692 --> 07:09.928
Otherwise, we need to go to
a hotel, I need to shower.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.098
- Shower it is, okay, baby.

07:58.077 --> 07:59.845
That's one down.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.514
Now a shower for milady.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.803
I can't believe this is you.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.608
That is some big hair.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.110
How come you never showed
me this pic before?

08:32.111 --> 08:34.613
- Because it's not me.
- What?

08:34.615 --> 08:37.015
- That's her, that's mother.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.355
- Huh.

08:43.789 --> 08:47.125
She's got a lot of
these laying around.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.930
- They're all of her.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.766
They always were.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.607
- You two could be sisters.

09:04.477 --> 09:08.280
- I'm an only child.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.154
- Tea, extra honey.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.222
- Thank you.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.260
- Looking at pics of
a supermodel, I see.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.429
- She seemed to think so.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.600
- You never really
talked about her much.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.268
- There's a reason.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.905
- Care to share?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.741
- Mother only cared
about what she wanted,

09:36.743 --> 09:38.443
not what I wanted.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.812
She was impossible to be around.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.181
- That sounds like all mothers.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.484
I mean, you know mine,
all she ever does

09:46.486 --> 09:50.388
is guilt-trip me and
tell me to have kids and,

09:51.524 --> 09:54.960
uh, send me corned
beef and cabbage.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.429
- She wanted to be around you.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.398
I got so lonely, I had
an imaginary friend.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.969
Her name was Bethany.

10:03.971 --> 10:07.939
- What, no neighborhood
kids or kids from school?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.841
- I was home-schooled,

10:09.843 --> 10:13.345
and playing with other
children was unladylike.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.380
- Wow, my mom is starting to
sound a lot less annoying.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.350
- I wouldn't go that far, you
remember last Thanksgiving?

10:18.352 --> 10:22.153
- Yikes, yes, I do, and
her cell phone rings

10:22.155 --> 10:24.289
to the stabbing
music from psycho.

10:39.171 --> 10:42.874
This is a big decision,
we need to talk about it.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.376
- No, we don't.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.478
- Yes, we do, Claire.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.848
Look, baby, I love you...
- and I love you, Aaron.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.917
That's not the question here,
it never is, it never was.

10:56.289 --> 11:00.091
I think that we should deal
with things one thing at a time,

11:00.093 --> 11:03.194
and this house is a big
enough thing to deal with,

11:03.196 --> 11:04.829
so can we please
just deal with that...

11:04.831 --> 11:08.166
- I am, and you're
right, it is a big thing.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.902
It's a great big thing
that we talked about

11:10.904 --> 11:13.772
and agreed upon
before we moved here.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.707
- Well, it's different now.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.709
- How?

11:17.643 --> 11:19.944
It's better.
- For you, maybe.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.680
For me, this house...

11:22.748 --> 11:25.016
- it's the best break
we've ever gotten.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.185
- Being here feels wrong,

11:29.822 --> 11:30.822
off,

11:32.024 --> 11:34.726
like I'm walking through
someone else's memory of life

11:34.728 --> 11:37.662
and I don't want it to be mine.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.900
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.536
I am.

11:45.871 --> 11:49.107
But the reality is,
this house is old,

11:51.410 --> 11:53.445
it needs a lot of work

11:53.447 --> 11:56.014
before it could make any
money on today's market,

11:56.016 --> 11:58.049
but for us,

11:58.051 --> 12:00.719
it's priceless, we've won
the lottery here, sweetie.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.454
- Yeah, well, when
you win the lottery,

12:02.456 --> 12:03.722
you cash in the ticket,

12:03.724 --> 12:05.824
you don't move into
the fucking 7-Eleven.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.125
- Don't.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.728
Don't storm off like
that's your final word.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.263
I left my friends and business
to come here with you,

12:12.265 --> 12:14.666
as well, so don't act like you're
the only one on the cross.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.251
- Goodnight, Bethany.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.658
- Claire, I think you're

13:13.660 --> 13:15.527
deflecting the question.

13:15.529 --> 13:18.263
Remember, my office
is a safe place.

13:18.265 --> 13:22.467
The only thing that matters
here is honesty to ourselves.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.837
No one is perfect in
the eyes of the world,

13:25.839 --> 13:29.307
so let's address the
monster in the room.

13:31.076 --> 13:34.145
You want to have a
child with Aaron?

13:37.183 --> 13:39.918
- Yes, I do, just not right now.

13:42.955 --> 13:46.124
- Is that because last time,

13:46.126 --> 13:48.126
the baby was stillborn?

13:49.695 --> 13:52.430
- No, it's because I don't want

13:52.432 --> 13:54.999
to have a child in this house.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.235
- Why?

13:57.237 --> 14:00.271
- Because I don't want
to become my mother.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.274
- And having a child in
this house would do that?

14:03.276 --> 14:05.243
I mean, that's crazy.
- Do not call me that.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.780
- I'm not calling you crazy,
I'm saying the thought process

14:08.782 --> 14:11.082
is crazy...
- well, it's the same thing.

14:11.084 --> 14:14.052
- That's good,
Claire, you're angry.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.221
Now let's talk about why.

14:20.926 --> 14:25.163
- I cut both of my wrists
after my baby was born dead.

14:27.399 --> 14:32.003
I was filled with pain
and anguish and hormones,

14:32.005 --> 14:35.173
and I lashed out at
myself to end it.

14:36.976 --> 14:40.445
And I have come to terms with
that, it's part of who I am,

14:40.447 --> 14:44.549
but it is not why I don't want
to have a baby in this house.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.451
- Good, good.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.586
So, let's figure out why.

14:52.758 --> 14:55.326
What do you think it might be?

14:58.731 --> 14:59.731
Claire?

15:01.567 --> 15:02.567
- Honey?

15:04.036 --> 15:05.036
I'm sorry.

15:06.338 --> 15:07.772
- It's not your fault, Aaron,

15:07.774 --> 15:09.774
and anger isn't
always a bad thing.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.009
It's progress.

15:11.810 --> 15:13.878
- Really?
- Absolutely!

15:13.880 --> 15:15.346
Her anger will pass,

15:15.348 --> 15:19.918
but the moment will be fertile
ground for contemplation.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.753
Just be patient.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.757
- Okay.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.158
Okay, thank you.

15:42.007 --> 15:46.978
- She always prides beauty
and status above all else.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.882
- These were your mother's?

15:50.884 --> 15:52.784
- No, these were mine.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.654
- What are they for?

15:57.690 --> 16:00.825
- Beauty pageants.
- Beauty pageants, huh?

16:00.827 --> 16:02.827
How come I never
knew about this?

16:02.829 --> 16:06.631
- Because I did them
when I was a little kid.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.669
- That's just,
that's just cruel,

16:12.972 --> 16:15.573
making a little girl for fight

16:15.575 --> 16:18.309
for the validation of strangers.

16:23.349 --> 16:26.317
- That's all my
mother cared about.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.687
- I'm sorry, honey.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.990
- This is it.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.225
This is my life.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.872
- You see, she's
won every pageant,

16:47.874 --> 16:49.574
and she's only just begun.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.776
- Her accolades are
quite impressive.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.511
- Yes, she's my perfect girl.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.846
Do a pirouette.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.149
- Very impressive indeed.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.418
- Thank you, miss Freedman,
I also do gymnastics...

17:00.420 --> 17:02.887
- oh, that's enough, you can go.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.723
- Nice to meet
you, miss Freedman.

17:05.724 --> 17:08.291
You too, sweetie.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.029
- You know, she would be
the perfect poster child

17:11.031 --> 17:13.097
for your pageant this year.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.565
- She is darling.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.401
I'll see what I can do, Susan.

17:16.403 --> 17:20.271
- You know, I think that you
can do more than just see.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.173
- I can't accept that.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.775
- Of course you can.

17:23.777 --> 17:27.111
This is her life,
it's all she has.

17:30.316 --> 17:31.316
Good.

17:32.351 --> 17:33.351
Tea?

17:34.153 --> 17:35.219
- All right.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.313
- Don't worry, I'm pretty
sure we can streamline

18:02.315 --> 18:03.681
your workflow and
get your office

18:03.683 --> 18:06.284
up and running in no time, bye.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.686
- Potential new client?
- Potential huge new client.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.923
They me to bid on
the entire building.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.462
- That's fantastic.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.630
- What did I tell you,
good things ahead.

18:19.632 --> 18:23.868
- I'm really excited for you.
- For us, this could be huge.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.214
I'll be back soon.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.283
And think about it.

20:10.242 --> 20:11.242
- Get it.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.919
- You know, Gary's
been here five years

20:54.921 --> 20:58.189
and he's never made a
cross-platform proposal like that.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.324
I mean, the guy looks
and talks like Mr. Magoo,

21:00.326 --> 21:02.827
but baby, he's in.
- That's great, honey.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.263
- He's in, he's down,
and he's on board.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.932
Their infrastructure,
it's a dinosaur.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.202
Their bandwidth's a joke,
the hardware is Aztec,

21:11.204 --> 21:13.604
but they just had a massive
acquisition of their ip,

21:13.606 --> 21:15.306
and guess who bought them.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.240
- Uh...

21:16.242 --> 21:17.775
- come on, guess, guess, guess.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.144
Who's your favorite
search engine,

21:20.146 --> 21:23.114
that makes cyborg eyewear and
wants to cheer for a march?

21:23.116 --> 21:25.616
- Goo...
- Yeah, that's it!

21:25.618 --> 21:28.786
But don't say anything
because, you know,

21:28.788 --> 21:32.256
they might have
bugged the house.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.824
I mean, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding,

21:33.826 --> 21:35.993
but we've got to keep it
on the down-low for now.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.095
I mean, this is a complete
reboot of the entire facility

21:38.097 --> 21:39.730
and they want me to do it, me.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.434
Holy crap, I think I
know how your mom felt

21:43.436 --> 21:46.404
when she won miss apple pie.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.872
- Apple festival.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.574
- Exactly, except my crown will

21:50.576 --> 21:52.643
be made out of
fiber-optic cable.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.178
Financial stability, baby.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.846
Think about it, you
won't even have to work,

21:55.848 --> 21:57.248
you won't even have to work!

21:57.250 --> 21:58.816
You can be a mom,
like we talked about,

21:58.818 --> 22:00.551
you know, a stay-at-home mom.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.620
Of course, you'll want
to get out of the house,

22:02.622 --> 22:04.422
get to the gym, take
care of yourself.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.923
You gotta take care

22:05.925 --> 22:07.825
of your body, keep you in good
shape, you know what I mean,

22:07.827 --> 22:09.293
sweetheart?

22:09.295 --> 22:10.795
Want to keep you pretty and ripe

22:10.797 --> 22:12.430
like a little apple doll,

22:12.432 --> 22:14.699
my little apple,
fresh little darling.

22:47.265 --> 22:49.133
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

22:50.169 --> 22:52.370
No, no, no, no, no, get off!

22:52.372 --> 22:55.439
They're gonna eat me...
- baby, hey!

22:55.441 --> 22:57.308
What are you looking at?
- They're on me.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.110
- Claire, you're okay, Claire!

22:59.112 --> 23:01.712
There's nothing here,
sweetie, there's nothing here,

23:01.714 --> 23:04.582
sweetheart, there's
nothing here, it's just,

23:04.584 --> 23:07.017
it's just us.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.887
- It's just us.
- It's just us, you're safe.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.457
Just you and me.

23:14.493 --> 23:15.493
Okay, okay.

23:17.295 --> 23:19.363
Do you want to lay down?

23:22.033 --> 23:23.033
Okay.

23:23.969 --> 23:26.604
You want me to
bring you some tea?

23:27.439 --> 23:28.839
Okay, it's okay.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.576
It's all right.

23:37.883 --> 23:41.519
- Sorry, I don't know...
- Hush, it's okay.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.987
I'll be right up.

23:54.633 --> 23:58.002
- I'm really proud
of you, Aaron.

23:58.004 --> 24:02.106
You work really hard,
they're lucky to have you.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.674
- Thank you, baby.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.970
- Make sure you use the blush.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.840
A Princess always makes sure

26:16.842 --> 26:20.244
that her cheeks are
like perfect roses.

26:27.385 --> 26:28.619
Gently, child.

26:29.721 --> 26:33.057
We don't want to
look like a whore.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.125
Wipe it clean and do it again.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.360
- Yes, mother.

26:38.730 --> 26:41.899
- Again!

27:50.869 --> 27:52.870
- Claire, are you okay?

27:55.940 --> 27:56.940
- Yeah.

27:58.243 --> 27:59.243
Yeah, I'm,

28:01.079 --> 28:05.249
I'm fine, I'm just looking
at something, I guess.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.119
- As long as you're all right,

28:09.121 --> 28:11.255
I'm just a little
concerned for you.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.257
- Yeah.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.359
Thanks.

28:16.394 --> 28:17.394
I just, um,

28:18.963 --> 28:20.764
I mean, I don't know.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.404
- Yeah, I get that.

28:31.476 --> 28:32.476
So,

28:33.745 --> 28:35.779
this is your old room, huh?

28:35.781 --> 28:36.781
- Yeah.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.255
- Were you a little
person your whole life

28:45.257 --> 28:47.424
before we started dating?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.895
- I know, it's weird.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.631
- Weird, yeah.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.735
But seriously, you were how
old when you moved down...

28:57.737 --> 28:58.737
- 17.
- 17.

28:59.804 --> 29:01.572
- I was 17 years old before

29:01.574 --> 29:04.408
I stood up to her
and walked out.

29:05.443 --> 29:07.044
- I just don't see you playing

29:07.046 --> 29:11.815
with dolls and stuffed
animals when you were 17.

29:11.817 --> 29:15.486
I kind of see you as
more of a cherry bomb.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.959
A hot chick with a bad attitude.

29:21.961 --> 29:22.961
You know.

29:24.362 --> 29:28.332
- Yeah, that was me.

29:37.609 --> 29:42.346
- So you're not the one who
left your room in a time warp?

29:42.348 --> 29:45.349
- No, it was, it
was dark and messy

29:46.484 --> 29:48.485
and covered in posters.

29:50.321 --> 29:54.224
- Because this, this looks
like pre-tween Claire

29:54.226 --> 29:58.862
is frozen in carbonite
and it's a little creepy.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.398
- I think this stuff
must have been in boxes

30:01.400 --> 30:03.967
years before I even moved out.

30:07.105 --> 30:08.739
Mr. Snuffles, here,

30:10.175 --> 30:13.577
is where I used to hide
my weed in junior high.

30:20.618 --> 30:22.352
It's totally creepy.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.289
- Hey, I made some tea.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.129
Do you want some?

30:43.141 --> 30:46.276
Chamomile, lots of honey.
- Thank you.

30:49.881 --> 30:53.550
- I'm sorry you're having
such a rough time with this.

30:53.552 --> 30:56.820
- I'm sorry, I didn't know
that this would put me,

30:56.822 --> 30:59.656
us, through the
ringer like this.

30:59.658 --> 31:00.924
- I know, baby.

31:02.894 --> 31:06.530
- I know you know, and
I love you for that.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.099
- And I love you.

31:09.101 --> 31:13.503
I just want you to be
happy, whatever that is.

31:13.505 --> 31:14.571
- Thank you.

31:17.175 --> 31:22.012
- Have you thought about
medications, going back on them?

31:22.014 --> 31:23.313
- Aaron.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.148
- I'm just saying that Dr. brown

31:25.150 --> 31:27.117
is way better than
that old quack.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.019
He's young and hip and...
- really?

31:29.021 --> 31:31.121
- No, no, he's no Elvis,

31:31.123 --> 31:33.357
but he's up to speed on
all the newest options

31:33.359 --> 31:36.760
and it's just, it's
worth thinking about.

31:36.762 --> 31:40.564
- I don't want to be a zombie
again, Aaron, that was awful.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.967
- I know it was rough,
but it can be better.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.570
We can do it together.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.805
Just think about it, okay?

31:49.707 --> 31:53.010
And talk to him.
- Okay, I will.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.346
- You were listless
and you didn't bathe

31:56.348 --> 31:58.115
and you didn't laugh at my jokes

31:58.117 --> 31:59.917
and you ate the
neighbor's brains which...

31:59.919 --> 32:00.919
- hey!

32:02.854 --> 32:05.489
Now, I'm going to take a shower

32:07.592 --> 32:10.394
so I don't smell
like the undead.

32:14.899 --> 32:18.168
- You're not just some
stinky zombie, honey.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.237
You're my stinky zombie.

34:36.774 --> 34:37.774
- Hey.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.110
Hey, hey, hey.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.513
You have a nightmare?
- Yeah.

34:46.117 --> 34:48.784
- I got you, kitten, I got you.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.856
No boogeymen tonight.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.592
And tomorrow,

34:57.161 --> 35:00.464
the Mason family steps
onto the gravy train.

35:00.466 --> 35:04.301
It's good dreams
for everybody, okay?

35:04.303 --> 35:05.303
- Okay.

37:38.522 --> 37:39.522
Bethany?

37:52.603 --> 37:54.671
- Claire, you hear that?

37:57.708 --> 37:58.908
Claire?

38:05.516 --> 38:06.816
Claire, Claire!

38:09.287 --> 38:10.287
Claire!

38:11.255 --> 38:12.255
Oh, oh, no.

38:13.658 --> 38:15.659
No, no, no, no, no.

38:15.661 --> 38:19.296
No, no, Claire, Claire,
can you hear me, Claire?

38:19.298 --> 38:21.164
Claire, can you hear me?

38:21.166 --> 38:23.466
Uh, sweetie, I need
you to stay awake.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.469
Okay, honey, stay awake for me.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.872
And I need you to stay awake

38:30.007 --> 38:32.809
and I need you to
tell me your name.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.145
- Claire, Claire Mason.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.314
- Yes, that's right, baby.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.815
That's very good, very good,

38:38.817 --> 38:40.784
and don't fall asleep.

38:40.786 --> 38:45.021
Okay, so, can you tell
me what year it is?

38:45.023 --> 38:46.222
- What?

38:46.224 --> 38:49.192
- What year is it,
baby, you stay awake.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.794
- 2016.

38:50.796 --> 38:53.997
- That's great, that's
great, sweetie pie.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.433
You're doing really
well, don't fall asleep.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.968
Just tell me my name.
- Bethany.

38:58.970 --> 39:01.271
- Claire, Claire, stay awake.

39:01.273 --> 39:03.006
They're on their way.

39:03.008 --> 39:07.143
Claire, Claire, honey, Claire,
baby, please stay awake.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.479
Stay awake, Claire, Claire.

39:52.490 --> 39:53.490
- Claire.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.334
Claire, come here, baby.

40:06.604 --> 40:08.438
Come here, it's okay.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.653
Mommy needs a hug, come here.

40:25.856 --> 40:26.856
I'm sorry.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.893
Oh, you're so pretty.

40:37.701 --> 40:39.169
You're so pretty.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.175
You have so much ahead of you.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.280
I used to look like you.

40:53.784 --> 40:58.254
You're mom's pretty little
one, now, you know that.

40:58.256 --> 40:59.256
Do you?

41:01.158 --> 41:02.725
You're all I have.

41:07.097 --> 41:09.165
Beauty is just so brief.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.570
It's goes so fast.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.872
- Mommy, you're hurting me.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.942
Mommy!
- How dare you!

41:19.944 --> 41:22.912
- Let go of me!
- Give me that, give it!

41:22.914 --> 41:25.114
It's time you grew up!

42:05.790 --> 42:09.192
- Aaron.
- I'm here, Claire.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.494
- How was she in the house?

42:12.363 --> 42:14.531
- It was a dream, Claire.

42:15.332 --> 42:16.733
- What happened?

42:18.536 --> 42:21.337
- I was hoping
you could tell me.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.174
- The noise, it moved,

42:27.011 --> 42:30.313
she moved further,
further than before,

42:30.315 --> 42:33.516
and I followed her
to the stairs and,

42:33.518 --> 42:35.952
and then she pushed me.

42:35.954 --> 42:39.656
The wall, a hand came from the
wall, and it pushed me down.

42:39.658 --> 42:43.493
It sounds like a great entry

42:43.495 --> 42:45.762
into your dream journal, Claire,

42:45.764 --> 42:47.630
but I want to know the truth.

42:47.632 --> 42:50.600
- That is the truth.

42:50.602 --> 42:51.901
- Did you know?

42:52.770 --> 42:55.371
- What, know?
- Did you know?

42:55.373 --> 42:57.840
- Did i...
- Because I do, now.

43:00.411 --> 43:04.280
Er protocol, they, they
checked you for drugs,

43:06.617 --> 43:10.853
hallucinogens, they wouldn't
even let me come close to you

43:13.223 --> 43:16.225
until Dr. brown talked
to the duty nurse,

43:16.227 --> 43:17.961
explained your past.

43:21.231 --> 43:23.399
And then the rabbit died.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.768
- Rabbit, what?

43:29.707 --> 43:31.975
- You're pregnant, Claire.

43:36.748 --> 43:37.814
It's a fact.

43:38.716 --> 43:41.017
It's six weeks of fact.

43:43.254 --> 43:47.156
Now, what I need to know,
what I have to know,

43:48.058 --> 43:50.059
is did you know?

43:50.061 --> 43:54.230
Did you know and go down
those stairs on purpose?

43:55.232 --> 43:56.799
- What?

43:56.801 --> 43:59.602
Why would I ever...
- I don't know.

44:00.671 --> 44:02.572
Exactly, I don't know.

44:03.674 --> 44:04.674
- No!

44:05.609 --> 44:06.609
Aaron, no!

44:07.778 --> 44:09.345
No, I would never.

44:10.347 --> 44:12.248
Oh, my god, Aaron, no.

44:15.085 --> 44:16.319
I didn't know.

44:17.855 --> 44:18.855
I'm sorry.

44:22.226 --> 44:23.226
Is it okay?

44:26.096 --> 44:27.563
Is the baby okay?

44:31.468 --> 44:33.136
- Our baby is fine.

44:41.613 --> 44:42.613
We're fine.

44:44.214 --> 44:48.451
- We're going to have a baby.
- We're going to have a baby.

44:54.992 --> 44:59.228
We're going to have a baby!

45:18.649 --> 45:20.950
I will be right downstairs.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.722
Call me if you need anything.

45:25.724 --> 45:27.123
- I will.
- Okay.

45:28.926 --> 45:31.060
- Thank you.
- No problem.

45:32.996 --> 45:34.797
Let's get you in bed.

45:45.976 --> 45:47.710
- I love you, Aaron.

45:50.147 --> 45:52.648
- I love you too, sweetheart.

46:27.651 --> 46:29.118
- Okay, I'm fine.

46:31.088 --> 46:32.088
I'm okay.

48:35.747 --> 48:37.813
- Claire, are you okay?

48:37.815 --> 48:39.715
- Uh, yeah.
- Claire?

48:42.153 --> 48:43.653
You sure you're all right?

48:43.655 --> 48:45.655
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

48:49.427 --> 48:52.561
- Can I get in there?
- Just a minute.

48:59.903 --> 49:02.772
- Hey.
- What did you need to do?

49:02.774 --> 49:03.774
- Uh, why?

49:04.741 --> 49:07.209
- Were you going
to take a shower?

49:07.211 --> 49:08.211
- No.

49:09.913 --> 49:12.848
Do I smell, or...
- oh, no, it's just,

49:12.850 --> 49:16.452
you know, these
old water heaters.

49:16.454 --> 49:17.520
- Oh, right.

49:18.855 --> 49:19.922
Yeah.
- Okay.

49:22.025 --> 49:23.025
- Hey.

49:24.127 --> 49:26.829
I love you, Claire bear.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.201
I love all of you.

49:37.908 --> 49:39.475
- I love you, too.

49:58.695 --> 50:01.297
- I will bring you Luddites
kicking and screaming

50:01.299 --> 50:02.598
into the modern age.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.467
- Hey, not till after
dinner, sith lord.

50:04.469 --> 50:06.802
- Yes, ma'am, I promise.

50:06.804 --> 50:07.804
- Promise.

50:08.839 --> 50:11.040
- Wrong franchise,
but I'll take it.

50:11.042 --> 50:13.676
- Oh.

50:13.678 --> 50:15.745
Well, you really didn't have

50:15.747 --> 50:17.246
to go through all this trouble.

50:17.248 --> 50:19.015
I didn't want to put you out.

50:19.017 --> 50:21.617
- Oh, no, I mean, you're
practically family.

50:21.619 --> 50:24.220
I mean, the only
family we can stand.

50:24.222 --> 50:25.888
- I thought I should follow up,

50:25.890 --> 50:29.792
see how you guys were
doing after what happened.

50:29.794 --> 50:32.461
See how she was doing.

50:32.463 --> 50:35.765
- It's much appreciated,
really, above and beyond, sir.

50:35.767 --> 50:39.702
- You know, secretly, the
drive is like a mini-vacation.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.937
I tell Janice that
the phone's dead

50:41.939 --> 50:44.507
then I use it as a
chance to catch up

50:44.509 --> 50:46.642
on all my trashy books on tape.

50:46.644 --> 50:49.245
- To life's little luxuries.

50:49.247 --> 50:51.580
- Cheers.

50:58.555 --> 51:01.757
- Oh, I miss Canada sometimes.

51:01.759 --> 51:04.126
The little things, Caesar's...

51:04.128 --> 51:06.529
- Caesar's, is that
the pizza chain or...

51:06.531 --> 51:08.898
- no, Caesar's,
it's a bloody Mary

51:08.900 --> 51:12.568
with clam juice and booze.
- Clam juice and booze?

51:12.570 --> 51:14.136
That sounds disgusting.

51:14.138 --> 51:15.838
- But it's good.
- Really?

51:15.840 --> 51:17.440
Do they have, like,
sardines and beer?

51:17.442 --> 51:19.308
- Yeah, somebody should do that,

51:19.310 --> 51:20.709
or octopus and whiskey.

51:20.711 --> 51:21.644
- Yeah.

51:21.646 --> 51:22.812
- It's the little things, right?

51:22.814 --> 51:24.780
It's the little things,
like the up-speak,

51:24.782 --> 51:26.949
how we end every sentence
with a question mark.

51:26.951 --> 51:28.951
We sound like a bunch of elves.

51:30.455 --> 51:32.855
It's just not cool, not sexy.

51:32.857 --> 51:34.557
It's the worst with the ladies.

51:34.559 --> 51:36.358
- Oh, that's not true.

51:36.360 --> 51:39.095
- Well, of all the
commonwealth countries,

51:39.097 --> 51:42.498
our accent, Irish,
Australian, Canadian,

51:44.201 --> 51:47.002
we sound like a bunch
of apologetic hobbits.

51:47.004 --> 51:48.504
- It's not that bad.

51:48.506 --> 51:51.574
- Actually, it's
our super power.

51:51.576 --> 51:54.510
We hide behind politeness.

51:54.512 --> 51:56.545
It's the ultimate subterfuge,

51:56.547 --> 51:58.481
when everybody
thinks they're safe

51:58.483 --> 52:00.416
and we come charging
in on a moose,

52:00.418 --> 52:03.586
swinging a hockey stick and
screaming beer, it's true.

52:03.588 --> 52:06.322
- Yep, I am one of
the chosen, Mr. brown.

52:07.625 --> 52:09.525
- That's doc brown to you.

52:09.527 --> 52:11.694
- Only if you've got
a flux capacitor, eh?

52:11.696 --> 52:12.761
- I just might.

52:28.512 --> 52:29.512
- Aaron?

52:30.780 --> 52:33.349
Don't just sit there, help him!

52:36.053 --> 52:37.053
Aaron!

52:48.699 --> 52:49.832
- Yeah, baby?

52:59.442 --> 53:02.111
- Uh, nothing.

53:02.113 --> 53:05.281
Just the knife was
a little slippery.

53:06.483 --> 53:08.684
- Okay, but you called my name.

53:08.686 --> 53:11.587
- Yeah, uh, dinner's
almost ready.

53:12.822 --> 53:14.890
- Okay, thanks, sweetie.

53:20.030 --> 53:23.766
So, onto other, more
pressing matters.

53:23.768 --> 53:26.635
There is no way, I have to
give you push back on this,

53:26.637 --> 53:28.737
but there is no way
that a tralfamadorian

53:28.739 --> 53:30.039
would be friends with an ewok,

53:30.041 --> 53:31.440
it's not even the same universe.

53:31.442 --> 53:33.342
- Clearly you don't
understand the complexities

53:33.344 --> 53:37.580
of slaughterhouse five, or
the politics of the ewok.

54:12.148 --> 54:16.051
- A mare, is it inherited...
- Help me, help me!

54:17.654 --> 54:18.654
- Claire!

54:19.923 --> 54:22.224
Claire, Claire, what, oh, no.

54:22.226 --> 54:24.193
No, no, what did you do, baby?

54:24.195 --> 54:25.628
What did you do?

54:25.630 --> 54:26.795
- I'm going to
call an ambulance.

54:26.797 --> 54:28.964
- It was
Bethany, she grabbed me.

54:28.966 --> 54:32.401
I had to stop her,
cut her fingers off.

54:34.872 --> 54:35.872
Aaron.

54:37.073 --> 54:40.843
- Please, no, no, no, no!

54:50.687 --> 54:53.622
It's okay, Claire, I'm here.

54:53.624 --> 54:56.859
- It's okay, Claire,
you're in the hospital.

54:56.861 --> 54:58.594
- The baby?

54:58.596 --> 55:01.096
- It's fine, the baby is fine.

55:02.365 --> 55:06.235
- But you're not,
sweetheart, you need rest.

55:06.237 --> 55:08.470
- I just woke up.

55:09.339 --> 55:11.674
Aaron, why am I handcuffed?

55:12.742 --> 55:15.010
- It's for your
protection, Claire.

55:15.012 --> 55:16.979
Yours and the child's.

55:16.981 --> 55:20.182
- I didn't do
this, I didn't do this.

55:20.184 --> 55:23.085
She, she did this,
she made me do this.

55:23.087 --> 55:26.588
- Honey, honey, we were
there, we saw what happened.

55:26.590 --> 55:28.724
- You didn't see,
you didn't see, Aaron,

55:28.726 --> 55:30.693
because she chose
me, she wants me.

55:30.695 --> 55:32.628
Aaron, you just didn't see.
- Claire, please just...

55:32.630 --> 55:34.463
- no, Aaron,
you have to listen to me,

55:34.465 --> 55:36.065
you have to be on my side, okay,

55:36.067 --> 55:37.366
you can't turn your back on me...

55:37.368 --> 55:39.101
- Listen, i...
- And think that I'm crazy.

55:39.103 --> 55:40.836
- I'm not turning my
back on you, sweetheart,

55:40.838 --> 55:42.938
but you need to calm down.
- No, no.

55:42.940 --> 55:46.041
- Just rest, Claire, we're
getting you the help you need.

55:46.043 --> 55:47.543
It's good for you.

55:47.545 --> 55:49.478
- No, I'm not
a child, I'm not crazy,

55:49.480 --> 55:51.380
I'm not crazy, she did
this, the little girl,

55:51.382 --> 55:54.016
the girl did this, no,
goddammit, Aaron, let me out.

55:54.018 --> 55:56.652
God, what is that, what is that?

55:56.654 --> 56:00.823
- It's fine, she's fine,
it's safe, Claire, it's safe.

56:05.128 --> 56:08.130
It's safe.
- Aaron, I didn't do this.

56:08.132 --> 56:11.500
It was her, she did
this to me, to us,

56:11.502 --> 56:13.502
Bethany, Bethany.

56:13.504 --> 56:16.472
- Please, sweetheart,
it's okay, just sleep.

56:16.474 --> 56:18.407
It's going to be all
right, I love you, baby.

56:18.409 --> 56:20.142
- Aaron...
- I love you so much.

56:20.144 --> 56:21.577
I love you so much.

56:43.800 --> 56:47.536
- Mom?

56:51.508 --> 56:52.508
Mommy?

57:06.689 --> 57:08.424
Mommy, are you okay?

57:15.166 --> 57:16.166
- I'm fine.

57:18.234 --> 57:19.234
She bit me.

57:20.770 --> 57:22.371
- What?

57:22.373 --> 57:26.675
- That ugly, worthless
little animal bit me.

57:26.677 --> 57:27.677
Come here.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.847
I said, come here!

57:33.450 --> 57:35.350
Look at the water.

57:35.352 --> 57:38.487
- No, I don't want to...
- Look at the water!

57:38.489 --> 57:41.857
This is what ugliness
brings, do you understand?

57:41.859 --> 57:43.125
- Yes, mother.

57:43.127 --> 57:46.662
- This is what happens
when you lose a baby.

58:02.412 --> 58:05.781
- Claire, Claire, Claire,
no, no, baby, please, please!

58:05.783 --> 58:08.784
Please wake up, please
wake up, please!

58:08.786 --> 58:10.519
Please, baby, don't!

58:12.689 --> 58:13.689
No!

58:15.024 --> 58:18.861
Claire, Claire, wake up,
wake up, Claire, Claire!

58:21.532 --> 58:22.865
- Aaron, Aaron.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.669
Come on, let's go home.

58:29.138 --> 58:32.307
There's nothing you
can do here now.

58:32.309 --> 58:34.476
She's going to be
asleep for hours.

58:34.478 --> 58:36.044
Let's go, come on.

58:36.813 --> 58:38.447
There's a cab out front.

58:38.449 --> 58:40.649
I'll come pick you
up in the morning.

58:40.651 --> 58:43.619
- You sure?
- Yeah, come on.

58:43.621 --> 58:45.854
- Okay.
- Go home, go home.

58:49.726 --> 58:53.228
Get some sleep.

58:56.799 --> 59:00.102
- Thank you, uh, if
you weren't there,

59:01.471 --> 59:03.539
I mean, that was...
- hey.

59:05.008 --> 59:06.375
- I don't know what
I would have done,

59:06.377 --> 59:09.878
Paul, it was just...
- I was happy to help.

59:10.980 --> 59:13.315
Just get home, get
some rest, okay?

59:13.317 --> 59:14.583
- Yeah.

59:14.585 --> 59:17.152
- It's been a long night.
- Yeah.

59:17.154 --> 59:21.023
Uh, thank you for everything.
- I'm going on break.

59:21.025 --> 59:22.591
- Eight o'clock?

59:22.593 --> 59:24.026
- See you then.

59:24.028 --> 59:25.594
- Okay.

59:25.596 --> 59:27.596
- She's going to be okay.
- Yeah.

59:27.598 --> 59:29.264
- I'll be here.
- Okay.

59:29.266 --> 59:31.667
- Just relax.
- Thanks, Paul.

59:42.712 --> 59:44.780
- Right this way, ma'am.

59:46.549 --> 59:47.683
- Late night?

59:48.484 --> 59:49.885
- Early morning.

59:50.753 --> 59:52.654
How's your patient?

59:52.656 --> 59:54.056
- Good, for now.

59:55.625 --> 59:57.960
Kind of an odd one,
to be honest with you.

59:57.962 --> 59:59.728
- Well, let me know
if you need some help.

59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.496
- You are a godsend.

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:04.800
Hey, can I hop on this computer
and check some records?

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:49.511
- Come on.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.635
- Miss Aaron...
- Oh, fuck.

01:01:46.637 --> 01:01:49.037
- Miss Aaron.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.254
- Let's take a look, shall we?

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:47.589
- I just...

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:50.392
- I'm your doctor, dear.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:53.228
Now let's behave properly.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:56.765
No need for theatrics
or impudence.

01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:58.433
- Get away from me.

01:03:58.435 --> 01:04:00.101
- Oh, don't be shy.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:06.975
We both know that you
wouldn't be in a family way

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:10.078
if you were.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.347
- What?
- Shy, that is.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:15.383
- Get away from
me or I'll scream.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:16.751
- Come, come.

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:18.753
The checkup is routine.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.990
We've been down
this road before.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:26.228
You don't want to raise
up any old ghosts, do you,

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.832
Mrs. pinnacle?

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:35.203
- That's my name, how
do you know my name?

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:37.939
- My apologies.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.743
He's barely cold
by now, isn't he?

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:45.547
What's important are the girls

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:49.784
and you, Susan, you and
your previous little girls.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:54.823
Mommy's got to be
in tip-top shape.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.793
Mommy can't be the apple queen

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:04.232
if she's not in tip-top
shape, now, can she?

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.534
Mommy.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:10.138
- I'm not a mother,
I don't have a child.

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:18.880
- Silly lies don't suit
your apple pretty lips.

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:22.717
We were both there,
all of us were.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:25.220
Them that was and is not now.

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.491
Two little girls,

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:34.829
beautiful and pure
on the inside,

01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:37.465
one to Cherish, one to nourish,

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:44.039
a blessing and a curse.
- Please, I'm not her,

01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:46.608
I'm not my mother.
- Yes, you are!

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:50.412
To both of them!

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:55.884
God doesn't give us

01:05:55.886 --> 01:05:57.185
what we desire.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.789
God gives us what we need.

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:18.139
- Oh, babe.
- She's so beautiful.

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:22.911
Oh, my god, my little
Claire, you are perfect.

01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:24.479
- She's beautiful.

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:31.720
- Doctor, I think you need
to take a look at this.

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:34.122
- I understand,
nurse, thank you.

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:35.657
- Let me see her.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:39.227
Two tiny miracles, we
are so blessed, honey.

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:42.630
I want to hold her.
- Of course.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.236
- We did all we could.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:52.307
I'm sorry.

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:55.110
- I don't deserve this.

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:59.581
I don't deserve this!

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:03.451
What did you do to me,
what did you do to me?

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:08.390
What did you do?
- Susan, Susan.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:09.991
- Oh, my god.

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:12.160
- The girls need you now,
they need their mother.

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:13.728
Listen to me...
- what did you do?

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.063
- It'll be all right, I promise.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:16.698
Look at me, Susan, I promise.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.667
- What did you
do, what did you do?

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.102
- What did you do?

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:23.738
What did you do,
what did you do?

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.974
What did you do,
what did you do!

01:07:25.976 --> 01:07:28.043
- Enough, I said enough!

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.513
- Got you.

01:07:31.515 --> 01:07:33.081
Come on.

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:35.650
Stop.
- Miss Mason, are you okay?

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:37.252
- Yeah.

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:39.220
- Are you sure you're all right?

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.222
Did he touch you?

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.625
- Yes, or no, no, he didn't.

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.694
No, no, he didn't.

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:48.563
- Get Mr. merman
back to his room.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.232
This time, follow the
procedures precisely.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.134
- Yes, sir, come on, Mr. merman.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:55.203
- Doctor merman to
you, you young...

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:57.105
- yeah, just move your ass.

01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:58.940
- He's a doctor here?

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:00.942
- No, he used to
be, 15 years ago,

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:03.678
that was before the
pills and the mills.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.347
- He said he knows me,
he knows my mother.

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:08.249
He said he knows me.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.518
- Miss Mason, you seem
a little fuzzy still.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.554
Do you remember anything
about how you got down here?

01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:15.356
- Listen to me, he
knew my mother's name.

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:18.493
He knew about me, he
said I have a sister.

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:21.095
- Yeah, well, he also
wants to do a prostate exam

01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:22.630
on me every Wednesday.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.666
- He knew our names,
he knew mother's name.

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.468
The apple queen, he was there,

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:28.670
he saw all of us...
- let's take a walk,

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.305
and you can tell me all
about the apple queen, okay?

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:34.042
- Well, you need to let
my husband in right away.

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:35.609
- We'll do that...
- Just tell him.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.412
- But right now, you're
going to get some rest.

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:38.912
- Okay.

01:08:38.915 --> 01:08:40.515
- Because everything is
going to be so much better

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:43.984
once you rest.

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:50.625
- Hey, Paul, I was just about
to head to the hospital.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.961
- We need to talk,
can I come inside?

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:56.497
- Yeah, yeah, uh, is everything
okay, is Claire okay?

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.732
- She will be.

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:05.273
- What are these?

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.274
- Claire's family file.

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:10.444
- Is something
wrong with Claire?

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:12.046
- Yes.

01:09:12.048 --> 01:09:15.116
All of Claire's issues must
be stemming form Malory.

01:09:15.118 --> 01:09:16.118
- Malory?

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.487
Is that a mental illness or...

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.788
- Her twin sister.
- What?

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.825
- Claire had a twin sister.

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:27.795
- No, she's never said
anything about a sister.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:31.533
- She didn't know,
nobody told her.

01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:35.403
Claire's childhood was hidden
from her, from everyone.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:38.206
Her mother truly must
have been a monster.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.841
Look, look at this.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:40.843
Here.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:44.112
The baby was born
horribly deformed,

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:46.314
and her mother was so ashamed,

01:09:46.316 --> 01:09:49.417
she bribed the doctor to
falsify the birth records

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:51.452
to show that her
twin was stillborn

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.955
even though the baby
was still alive.

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:57.091
That explains the
genetic aberration.

01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:59.827
That's why your baby
was born stillborn.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:02.030
It was inherited
from the mother,

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:03.097
from Claire.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:08.570
- So,

01:10:11.006 --> 01:10:12.574
what does it mean?

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:19.814
- Claire's imaginary friend.
- Yeah, uh, Bethany.

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:22.650
- Malory Bethany pinnacle.

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:26.254
- Wait, you're saying that
Bethany is Claire's sister?

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:28.089
- Her sister, precisely.

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:32.527
- Um, okay, Paul, but
you're not suggesting

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:36.531
something supernatural,
this is...

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.566
- Look, I'm a man of science,

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:42.270
but this house is doing
horrible things to her psyche

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:44.872
and I suggest you
don't bring her back.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:33.955
- Put your clothes on and get
dressed, please, right now.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.690
We have to leave, we have to go.

01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:36.791
- What's going on?

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.526
- I saw her, Bethany, Malory,

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:40.295
whatever her name is, I
saw her and she fooled me.

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:41.529
- Where?
- She fooled me,

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:42.664
just the same way
she fooled you.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:44.766
Dr. brown, she made me cut him.

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:47.769
- My god.
- On his throat, and he bled,

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:50.104
and he died, are you
going to help me,

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:51.773
who's going to believe me?

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.241
I don't want to go to jail.

01:11:53.243 --> 01:11:55.443
No one believed you
and I'm your husband,

01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:56.711
I didn't believe you.

01:11:56.713 --> 01:11:57.945
- No, no, no, okay?

01:11:57.947 --> 01:11:59.847
I need to lay her to rest.

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:01.049
- What?

01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:02.817
- She was my sister and
I will not treat her

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:06.154
the way my mother did, I
will not become my mother.

01:12:06.156 --> 01:12:08.923
We need to do this to move on.
- No, no.

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.993
- You don't have
to come with me but

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:16.230
I'm going back.
- I don't want to go.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.417
Are you sure?
- Not at all.

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.192
- I'm sorry.

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:48.896
I'm so sorry, I didn't want it.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.734
She made, she made me.

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:01.976
I'm sorry.

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.109
All right.

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:53.728
- There.

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:56.697
That was it.

01:13:57.499 --> 01:13:59.400
That was my place.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:25.426
- There's a hole in
here, like a tunnel.

01:14:25.428 --> 01:14:28.396
- Can you make this hole larger?

01:14:28.398 --> 01:14:29.797
- Yeah, hold on.

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.535
Okay.

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.638
Okay, that should be big enough.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.507
I'm going to, I'm
going to get inside.

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:15.510
- No, no, I have to.
- Claire, it's not safe.

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:17.144
- No, Aaron.

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:18.146
I need to.

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:20.515
She's my sister.

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:34.996
- Be safe.

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:55.349
- Where does it go?

01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:57.985
- I don't know, it keeps going.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.593
- No, honey, I don't like this,

01:16:05.595 --> 01:16:07.361
I don't like this, come back.

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:09.030
- Aaron, it's okay.

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.367
Follow my knocking.

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:40.461
- I'm right here, Claire.

01:16:52.008 --> 01:16:53.608
Again?

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:56.510
Got it.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.701
- Aaron, I see a tunnel.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.805
I'm going to go down.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:25.973
- Be careful.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.480
- Bethany.

01:18:43.453 --> 01:18:45.953
Bethany, I'm your sister!

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.294
It's okay, it's okay.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:55.930
Stop it!

01:18:57.432 --> 01:19:00.701
Stop it, Bethany,
I'm here to help you.

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:18.285
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay!

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.491
Listen, I'm here.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:26.694
Stop it, stop it, I'm here.

01:19:26.696 --> 01:19:29.930
Bethany, I'm here,
I'm here, I'm here.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.672
You're okay.

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:42.409
I'm here now.

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:45.546
I'm here, Bethany.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.282
You're okay.

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:52.119
You're safe.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.289
It was my fault.

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:45.326
It was my fault you died.

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:50.064
We went away.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.934
I was 10 years old and I,

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:58.105
I begged mom to take me skiing,

01:22:58.107 --> 01:22:59.673
it was a snow day.

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:04.611
Eight days in a cabin
with food and warmth

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.217
and friends,

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:15.055
while you starved here
alone in the dark.

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.765
It's my fault.

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:31.171
I understand why you
hated me, I hate me.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.743
I was your only friend,

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:39.813
but I didn't know you were real.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:45.152
I'm so sorry.

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:55.763
It's time to set you free.

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:30.564
- Honestly, I still
think you guys

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.399
could have gotten
a higher number,

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:35.102
but as long as you're happy.

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:43.777
- We are, very, thank you.

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:54.221
- Okay, then, well, if you've
taken everything you need

01:24:54.223 --> 01:24:56.156
and you've tied up
all your loose ends...

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:57.558
- yep, all done.

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:10.938
- It's been a real
pleasure, folks.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.273
- You, as well.
- Thank you.

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:39.233
- Are you hungry?

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:42.469
- Not really.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:44.338
I just want to get out of here.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.739
- Yeah.

01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:48.475
We can get something on the way.

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:53.614
Here's to new beginnings.
- To new beginnings.
