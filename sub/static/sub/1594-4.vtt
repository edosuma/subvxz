00:08.367 --> 00:12.166
For those of you
who are too fucking busy,

00:12.166 --> 00:14.200
this is what happened
last week on  Shameless.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.133
I left them.

00:15.133 --> 00:17.133
Get fucked!

00:18.567 --> 00:20.000
This your home now?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.533
First time in my life
I ever felt like

00:21.533 --> 00:23.100
I actually belonged somewhere.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.266
What's it like with my dad
living at your house?

00:25.266 --> 00:27.266
Weird.
It's only going
to get weirder.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.233
Last night was
my first time.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.367
You mean your
first time with me.

00:31.367 --> 00:32.633
Virgin?
Yep.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.367
Aunt Ginger has to go back?

00:34.367 --> 00:35.633
Don't make her go.

00:35.633 --> 00:36.734
She doesn't belong to us.

00:36.734 --> 00:38.266
Old guy next door died in March,

00:38.266 --> 00:40.567
which I guess, technically,
makes us next-door neighbors!

00:40.567 --> 00:42.000
Where's my damn toaster?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Leave me alone!
You would not
be so pissed off

00:45.000 --> 00:45.734
if you didn't care.

00:45.734 --> 00:46.667
When I saw the
way you looked

00:46.667 --> 00:48.433
at Steve,
like a D-O-G in heat.

00:48.433 --> 00:49.667
My mom heard about it.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.533
She invited you to dinner.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.300
Hi.

Debbie, come in and eat
your breakfast, okay?

02:32.700 --> 02:34.433
You're up next
in the shower.

02:34.433 --> 02:35.767
I want to play
for a while.

02:35.767 --> 02:38.066
Ask Carl if he'll come out
and get in the stroller.

02:38.066 --> 02:39.266
The last time
you asked Carl to play,

02:39.266 --> 02:40.667
you were locked in
the basement for half a day.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.200
That was on purpose.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.667
And we were playing
"Loser Goes to Gitmo."

02:43.667 --> 02:46.400
FIONA: Let's go! And put that
stroller back in the garbage.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.166
(metal creaking)

02:59.033 --> 03:01.166
Oh, man, yeah...
that's, uh, it's dead.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.667
You sure?
Uh-huh.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.233
The element's
rusted out.

03:04.233 --> 03:06.333
Anyone want to make some
Tollhouse cookies with me?

03:06.333 --> 03:07.500
How much to replace it?

03:07.500 --> 03:09.233
Uh, two bills
used, four new.

03:09.233 --> 03:10.367
FIONA:
Shit.

03:10.367 --> 03:11.500
How about a pie?

03:11.500 --> 03:13.033
I can get started
on the crust.

03:13.033 --> 03:14.367
Go take your shower.

03:14.367 --> 03:17.233
I... wanna... make... pie.

03:17.233 --> 03:18.667
You know what?
Hand me the obits.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.233
Maybe, uh, we can scrounge
a dead person's water heater.

03:21.233 --> 03:22.633
Thank you.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.166
Ah, Mrs. Dombrowski.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.100
Oh, the, uh,
shaky neck lady?

03:26.100 --> 03:28.233
I thought she drowned
a couple years ago.

03:28.233 --> 03:30.467
DEBBIE: No. Mrs. Goga
had the shaky neck,

03:30.467 --> 03:33.166
and she drowned in her
own vomit last Easter.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.600
No pie. Get in the shower.
I'm not saying it again.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.700
Carl, no.

03:36.700 --> 03:40.033
I went to school
with Kenny Dombrowski.

03:40.033 --> 03:41.400
Think he had
a crush on me.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.700
Her wake's this morning.
Let's go.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.100
Mm.
Up, up, up.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.233
Can I come?

03:45.233 --> 03:48.400
Um... no.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.300
Debbie, what is
going on with you?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.533
Nothing.

03:53.533 --> 03:56.000
(Fiona sighs with frustration)

03:58.133 --> 03:58.767
(inhales)

03:58.767 --> 04:00.266
Oof. Shower.

04:00.266 --> 04:01.333
After Debbie.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.633
Towel and robe,
upstairs. Go.

04:03.633 --> 04:05.400

04:05.400 --> 04:07.467

to change your own diaper.

04:54.467 --> 04:55.767
Across the street.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.533
Some sort of
a party for kids.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.467
No booze.

05:40.233 --> 05:42.200

05:42.200 --> 05:44.400
Oh, I know what

05:44.400 --> 05:45.667

06:14.767 --> 06:16.600
All right,

Aha.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.734
Fluffy, fluffy,
floo-floo.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.533
Went to see
a lawyer.

06:26.533 --> 06:29.133
It turns out I can't afford
to live somewhere else

06:29.133 --> 06:31.400

06:31.400 --> 06:32.767

Why can't you stay

06:34.300 --> 06:35.767
He's got gangrene.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.266
You ever smell
a rotting foot?

06:37.266 --> 06:38.667
Hey.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.367
Why don't you get me a refill
there, huh, Karen, honey?

06:41.367 --> 06:43.133
What, did you lose
your fucking legs?

06:43.133 --> 06:45.300

yourself into people's houses.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.734
Tall grande latte,
two shots.

08:00.734 --> 08:02.200
Sugar?
Absolutely.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.633
Kids home?

08:05.633 --> 08:07.066
Mm...

08:07.066 --> 08:08.333
Boys're out getting
a water heater,

08:08.333 --> 08:09.633
Debbie's at the park,

08:09.633 --> 08:13.166
Carl's out looking for small
defenseless pets to torture,

08:13.166 --> 08:14.700
and Liam's down for a nap.

08:14.700 --> 08:15.600
So...

08:15.600 --> 08:17.066
No.

08:17.066 --> 08:18.133
I'm up to my ass
in housework.

08:18.133 --> 08:19.367
That's why I'm taking you to

08:19.367 --> 08:21.033
a long, deep, leisurely lunch.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.100
Lunch?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.066
It's a euphemism.

08:23.066 --> 08:25.367
How quaint.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.533
Or, would you like a Demon dog
and a quick fuck

08:27.533 --> 08:29.233
over at the Sheridan?

08:29.233 --> 08:30.300
Liam?
Get a sitter.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.767
Costs too much.

08:31.767 --> 08:33.633
How much?

08:33.633 --> 08:35.100
At least 50 bucks.

08:37.233 --> 08:38.700
You're not paying me
to fuck you.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.367
No, I couldn't
pay you enough.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.633
(distant thud)

08:45.633 --> 08:46.700
Did you hear that?

08:46.700 --> 08:48.633
No.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.200
You didn't hear that?

08:50.200 --> 08:51.667
You trying to
change the subject?

08:51.667 --> 08:53.400
(thudding)

08:54.467 --> 08:55.700
Liam?

08:55.700 --> 08:58.400
He's too lazy to get out of
his crib-- he just yells.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.533
(thudding)

09:03.533 --> 09:05.567
You stay with Liam.
Wait, wait, wait...

09:08.667 --> 09:10.667
(whispering): You take
the baby, I'll take the bat.

09:11.734 --> 09:13.667
(whispers indistinctly)

09:28.033 --> 09:29.000
(clattering)

09:33.300 --> 09:35.734
Debbie! Jesus!

09:35.734 --> 09:37.667
Thought you went
to the park.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.367
I... came back.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.300
Are you okay?

09:41.300 --> 09:45.033
Katie Crasden's
having a party.

09:45.033 --> 09:46.433
Katie Crasden?

09:46.433 --> 09:48.433
Two streets over.

09:48.433 --> 09:50.467
STEVE: And she...
didn't invite you?

09:50.467 --> 09:52.000
She's only three.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.333
What happened?

09:53.333 --> 09:57.166
Well, I was just walking past,

09:57.166 --> 09:58.500
and her dad, he...

09:59.300 --> 10:01.467
Her dad did what?

10:01.467 --> 10:05.166
He was laughing and playing
with them, and it just...

10:05.166 --> 10:06.667
it wasn't fair.

10:06.667 --> 10:09.400
What wasn't fair? What?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.333
Everything.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.767
So I, I, um...

10:14.767 --> 10:17.233
I stole something.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.567
Oh...
(sighs)

10:18.567 --> 10:20.033
So nobody touched you?

10:20.033 --> 10:21.266
What?

10:21.266 --> 10:22.567
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

10:22.567 --> 10:25.333
TODDLER:
A bike.

10:27.033 --> 10:30.033
TODDLER:
Race car... don't hit the train!

10:30.033 --> 10:31.767
Debbie?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.133
(giggles)

10:36.133 --> 10:38.066
Who the hell is that?

10:38.467 --> 10:41.233

10:44.000 --> 10:46.033
WOMAN: We'll all be...
we'll just organize.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.000
We'll be okay.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.734
(sirens approaching)

10:52.467 --> 10:54.567
(sirens stop)
MAN: Just relax.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.600
Oh, here we go!

10:56.600 --> 11:00.200
No traffic tickets
to issue today?

11:00.200 --> 11:05.200
No one to pull over for swinging
wide on a left-hand turn?

11:05.200 --> 11:09.133
Or is this a supportive
"friend party" for a cop

11:09.133 --> 11:11.700
who shot some poor fucker
wasn't even armed?!

11:11.700 --> 11:13.500
Leave the people
around here alone.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.600
They're good folks!

11:14.600 --> 11:15.767
Who are the parents?

11:15.767 --> 11:17.433
Let's go, people.
Out of the way.

11:17.433 --> 11:18.433
Your child's missing?

11:18.433 --> 11:20.000
MAN:
Yeah.
I need your names

11:20.000 --> 11:22.100
and the name
of the child.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.467
Beth and Gary Casden.

11:24.467 --> 11:27.300
Mr. and Mrs. Casden, when is
the last time you saw...?
Uh, Ca-Casey.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.433
It's been
about an hour ago.

11:28.433 --> 11:31.333
Okay, okay.
What was he wearing?

11:31.333 --> 11:32.500
(chuckles)

11:32.500 --> 11:34.700
Debbie, why would
you steal

11:34.700 --> 11:37.533
a little girl?

11:37.533 --> 11:39.266
Why would you steal a little boy

11:39.266 --> 11:40.567
and dress him
like a little girl?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.367
(speaks indistinctly, laughs)

11:42.367 --> 11:44.633
I wanted a girl,
but there weren't any.

11:44.633 --> 11:46.767
Then back
to my initial question:

11:46.767 --> 11:48.500
Why would you steal
a baby at all?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.033
I miss Ginger.

11:50.033 --> 11:51.300
What?
Who?

11:51.300 --> 11:53.033
You took away Aunt Ginger!

11:53.033 --> 11:54.200
Who is Aunt Ginger?

11:54.200 --> 11:56.133
Somebody we borrowed
from V's nursing home.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.300
What?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.467
She was my friend.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.233
We have to take him back
right away, okay?

12:01.233 --> 12:02.367
Where are
his boy clothes?

12:02.367 --> 12:04.600
I washed them.

12:06.533 --> 12:08.233
Oh, my God, it shrunk!

12:08.233 --> 12:09.533
You put it in the dryer?

12:09.533 --> 12:11.533
That's what you do
after you wash something.

12:11.533 --> 12:14.567
Um, we can put him in
some of Liam clothes.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.166
We can't bring
a missing kid back

12:17.166 --> 12:18.333
wearing different
clothes.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.500
People will say
we did something to him.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.033
Something bad.

12:24.567 --> 12:26.266
MIKE (over P.A.):
Attention: This is...

12:26.266 --> 12:27.433
Attention:
This is the Chicago...

12:27.433 --> 12:29.467
Push, then...
I know what to push.

12:29.467 --> 12:30.533
Attention!
This is the Chicago...

12:30.533 --> 12:32.133
No. All right.
What are you doing?

12:32.133 --> 12:33.700
Mike, we have to get
the information out.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.567
Then let me drive.
No.

12:35.567 --> 12:38.467
Look, I've been a cop
a lot longer than you.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.033
You don't get to drive
and talk on the loudspeaker.

12:41.033 --> 12:42.633
What, are you gonna
call your uncle?

12:42.633 --> 12:45.166
Attention: This is the Chicago
Police Department.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.133
We're looking for a missing
two-year-old...

12:47.133 --> 12:49.767
IAN: So we're just
gonna wait out here?

12:49.767 --> 12:51.433
He's a chain-smoking
pothead in

12:51.433 --> 12:54.400
a stress-inducing situation;
he'll be out soon.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.567
What are we
supposed to say?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.166
I don't know.
Just play it cool.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.567
Play what cool?

12:59.567 --> 13:02.400
Things people play cool.
Jesus, Ian!

13:02.400 --> 13:03.533
(phone rings)

13:03.533 --> 13:05.300
You got your own cell?

13:05.300 --> 13:08.233
No, some kid left it in
the cafeteria.
Ah.

13:08.233 --> 13:10.166
Hey, Kare.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.700
Yeah, I'm at some
dead lady's house

13:11.700 --> 13:13.734
trying to see if I can
score a water heater.

13:13.734 --> 13:14.600
Meet me after?

13:14.600 --> 13:16.767
FIONA:
Hey, V?!

13:16.767 --> 13:18.500
I'm in the bathroom!

13:18.500 --> 13:20.500
Hey, I'm in a bit of a jam.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.734
Can you watch him
for 15 minutes?

13:21.734 --> 13:24.300
Damn, Fi, you see I'm in
the middle of doing my--

13:24.300 --> 13:25.633
Thanks.
Okay, sure.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.333
Hey, Li...!

13:31.033 --> 13:32.400
Who the fuck are you?

13:34.767 --> 13:38.233
(siren approaching)

13:38.233 --> 13:39.533
Oh, shit!

13:43.266 --> 13:44.133
Hey, Fiona.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.333
Hey, Tony.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.400
You remember Steve?

13:47.400 --> 13:49.100
Yeah. How's it going?

13:49.100 --> 13:50.734
Uh, hear about the missing boy?

13:50.734 --> 13:52.066
No. What happened?

13:52.066 --> 13:54.000
Got taken from a front yard
birthday party.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.100
Do they think he might have
just wandered off?

13:56.100 --> 13:57.500
We've got everybody out looking:

13:57.500 --> 14:00.300
choppers, SWAT, couple dozen
extra units, Amber alerts.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.200
Wow. Really.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.433
We're gonna catch the bastard
that took little Casey

14:04.433 --> 14:06.433
and chop his pedophile nuts off.

14:07.633 --> 14:10.000
(helicopter passes,
siren wails)

14:12.166 --> 14:15.533
Less than two hours ago, a young
boy, only two years of age,

14:15.533 --> 14:17.734
was abducted
from his front yard.

14:17.734 --> 14:19.066
You see this?

14:19.066 --> 14:21.433
This is what happens
when the world goes crazy.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.567
People steal kids.

14:23.567 --> 14:26.500
And Rastafarians
are allowed to roam free.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.266
I don't mean real Rastafarians.

14:28.266 --> 14:31.200
I mean Rastaman Goldberg's
from Lake Forest

14:31.200 --> 14:34.633
with rich parents who get
dropped off in Town Cars

14:34.633 --> 14:37.333
to go beg for money on
the streets.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.333
What a load of crap.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.600
Obamacare, my ass!

14:39.600 --> 14:41.533
What the news people
don't tell you?

14:41.533 --> 14:45.700
They love it
when kids get stolen.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.533
They're just looking
for a good story

14:47.533 --> 14:50.033
to saturate our airwaves with.

14:50.033 --> 14:52.500
And why are all
the news ladies Chinese?

14:52.500 --> 14:55.100
They should stick
to what they know:

14:55.100 --> 15:00.300
railroads... sushi...
dim sum.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.367
Frank, guess what.

15:02.367 --> 15:06.533
I made muffins using
a Bundt cake batter.

15:06.533 --> 15:09.333
I didn't even need
to add another egg.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.367
(chuckles)

15:10.367 --> 15:12.033
Hi, sweetie.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.033
The shithead gone?

15:13.033 --> 15:14.400
He just left for work.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.467
EDDIE:
I'm still here.

15:15.467 --> 15:17.367
Just getting my coat.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.633
I just had some
delicious penii.

15:19.633 --> 15:21.033
SHEILA: What?

15:21.033 --> 15:23.066
Little Casey up the street?
Gone missing

15:23.066 --> 15:25.266
right from his own backyard.

15:25.266 --> 15:27.300
Oh, that's terrible.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.166
You missed...

15:33.600 --> 15:36.166
(newscast playing quietly)

15:36.166 --> 15:39.700
MAN (on TV): ...Casey is
a loving and kind child...

15:42.600 --> 15:44.767
(sultry groan)

15:46.767 --> 15:48.233
Mm...!

15:48.233 --> 15:50.166
(newscast continues quietly)

15:50.166 --> 15:51.333
MAN:
It was less than that!

15:51.333 --> 15:53.033
WOMAN: My husband Mark
said that he saw...

15:53.033 --> 15:54.400
I know you're
all concerned, okay? I know.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.567
Everybody calm down--
I'll get to all of you, okay?

15:56.567 --> 15:58.133
Uh, you first, okay?
All right. We--

15:58.133 --> 16:01.100
I wasn't sure what size,
so bought three just in case.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.166
Oh, slow down.
Stop the car!
What?

16:04.166 --> 16:05.200
Hey! Hey!

16:06.233 --> 16:07.600
Hey, almost new.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.767
Debbie stole a baby--
we have to figure out

16:08.767 --> 16:09.734
how to return it.

16:09.734 --> 16:11.333
Debbie stole a baby?
STEVE: Yeah.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.367
Why?

16:12.367 --> 16:13.467
It's Debbie.

16:13.467 --> 16:15.367
I did not see that coming

16:15.367 --> 16:17.333
Um... can't we
just give it back?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.500
I wish we could.
It's too late now.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.633
Wow.

16:20.633 --> 16:22.066
Find Carl and get home now.

16:22.066 --> 16:24.266
Yeah.

16:29.066 --> 16:32.233
TONY (over P.A.): We're looking
for a missing boy named Casey.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.467
Last seen wearing
a Superman costume.

16:34.467 --> 16:35.600
Two years old.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.233
Any information would be
greatly appreciated.

16:38.233 --> 16:39.233
No questions asked.

16:39.233 --> 16:41.300
Why the fuck wouldn't
we ask questions?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.567
Because we want people
to feel safe.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.633
How do you find out
what happened if you
don't ask questions?

16:46.633 --> 16:48.033
You understand
the premise, right?

16:48.033 --> 16:49.667
People feel safe,
they give information,

16:49.667 --> 16:51.200
we find the kid.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.367
Safe, my ass.
I'm asking questions.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.166
Okay, yeah.
I'm gonna ask
fucking questions.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.633
That's what you do.
Go ahead.
Yeah, sure.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.433
You do what
you want to do.

16:58.433 --> 16:59.700
Casey Casden, last seen

16:59.700 --> 17:01.300
(in distance):
...wearing a Superman costume...

17:02.667 --> 17:04.333
Kev, stop!

17:04.333 --> 17:06.066
What's Liam doing here?

17:06.066 --> 17:07.700
It's not Liam.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.133
Who the hell is this?!
I don't know.

17:10.133 --> 17:11.500
Fiona dropped him off.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.333
TONY (over P.A.):
Attention, all residents.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.700
There is a child still missing.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.033
Approximately
two years of age,

17:16.033 --> 17:18.767
and wearing a Superman costume.

17:18.767 --> 17:20.633
If you've seen this boy...
Fucking Gallaghers.

17:20.633 --> 17:23.433
When I was a kid, we could go
to a birthday party

17:23.433 --> 17:27.000
and our parents wouldn't worry
that we were gonna get stolen

17:27.000 --> 17:29.767
out of the front yard
by some perv.

17:29.767 --> 17:32.433
That's when America had values.

17:32.433 --> 17:35.000
Before Wal-Mart and Dukakis,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.333
peanut butter and jelly in
one jar.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.600
You know, you're too young
to remember this,

17:39.600 --> 17:42.266
but there was a time when
policemen were respected,

17:42.266 --> 17:44.767
when young men wanted
to fight for their coury.

17:44.767 --> 17:46.567
When you could go vote twice

17:46.567 --> 17:48.700
for Mayor Daley,
down at the 11th Ward.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.100
Before some liberal pricks
elected a Muslim

17:52.100 --> 17:53.767
who isn't even American?

17:53.767 --> 17:56.000
FIONA:
We need to get

17:56.000 --> 17:57.367
your stories straight
for the police.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.667
Why did you take the boy?

17:58.667 --> 18:01.500
He was crying for his mom,
and his mom wasn't around.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.133
Did you try to find his mom?

18:03.133 --> 18:05.734
No, he was crying and
nobody cared, so I took him.

18:05.734 --> 18:08.300
You can't say that!
What's wrong with you?!
Hey, Fi!

18:08.300 --> 18:09.734
You know what, Debs?

18:09.734 --> 18:11.700
Was he inside or outside
of the yard

18:11.700 --> 18:13.033
when you grabbed him?

18:13.033 --> 18:13.734
Inside.

18:13.734 --> 18:17.100
Well, okay, so how'd
you get him out?

18:17.100 --> 18:19.433
I waved a Snickers bar at him.

18:19.433 --> 18:20.600
Did anybody see you?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.667
I don't think so.
We just ran.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.433
That wasn't suspicious.

18:24.433 --> 18:26.066
So you were running
down the street...

18:26.066 --> 18:27.066
I used a stroller.

18:27.066 --> 18:28.100
FIONA:
What stroller?

18:28.100 --> 18:29.066
Liam's old one.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.567
The one I told you
to throw out?

18:30.567 --> 18:31.567
I fixed it.

18:31.567 --> 18:34.133
For emergencies.

18:34.133 --> 18:37.066
(banging on door)

18:37.066 --> 18:38.467
VERONICA:
Open up! Hurry!

18:38.467 --> 18:40.233
Oh, shit.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.133
What in the hell
is going on?

18:43.133 --> 18:44.433
Is this that missing kid?

18:44.433 --> 18:46.400
Debbie stole him.
And now we have
to figure out

18:46.400 --> 18:48.600
how to give him back
without getting her
36 months in juvie.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.734
Why in the world
would she steal--

18:52.133 --> 18:54.166
There must be
a couple hundred cops out there.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.467
I know. I'm so sorry.

18:56.467 --> 18:57.667
Debs, will you watch him
for a second?

18:57.667 --> 18:59.533
VERONICA:
Come with us.

18:59.533 --> 19:01.400
Casey, we're gonna play
a couple games, okay?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.467
I'm not sure what's
going on with her.

19:03.467 --> 19:07.200
Oh, maybe it's 'cause your mom
bailed and Frank's a big drunk.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.233
Oh, what, I'm asshole now?
She's the one who stole a baby.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.367
All right, look, she
obviously planned it.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.066
I mean, she took a stroller out
of the garbage and she fixed it.

19:14.066 --> 19:15.600
All right, hey, Debbie's
still is a little kid.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.533
Worst thing that happens
is she gets some help.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.100
Help?
What kind of help?

19:19.100 --> 19:21.033
She stole a baby.
She's not crazy.

19:21.033 --> 19:23.633
She just sort of
accidentally
took a kid.
Not if she lured

19:23.633 --> 19:26.066
him out of the yard
with a candy bar.

19:26.066 --> 19:27.133
What are you
suggesting?

19:27.133 --> 19:28.500
Some kind or professional...

19:28.500 --> 19:30.033
What, a shrink?

19:30.033 --> 19:31.000
Gallaghers do not
do therapy.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.500
TONY (over P.A.):
We're looking for

19:32.500 --> 19:33.667
a missing two-year-old boy--
Casey Casden.

19:33.667 --> 19:37.133
He was last seen wearing
a Superman costume.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.600
If you have any information,
call 911.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.233
Lip, we need a plan
to get that boy back
to his family

19:41.233 --> 19:43.467
or Family Services is
gonna have a field day.

19:43.467 --> 19:44.667
Family Services?

19:44.667 --> 19:46.600
If they find out
Frank's moved,

19:46.600 --> 19:48.166
they'll take
the kids.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.166
Split 'em up.

19:49.166 --> 19:50.567
Remember what happened
last time?

19:56.567 --> 20:00.000
Shit.
Exactly.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.633
All right, Carl, you know
that pay phone that's outside

20:02.633 --> 20:04.033
of the Kash and Grab?

20:04.033 --> 20:06.133
Yeah.
All right,
I want you to get

20:06.133 --> 20:07.633
on your bike,
go to the pay phone,

20:07.633 --> 20:10.266
call the police, tell them
that you saw a little boy

20:10.266 --> 20:13.066
walking down Southport Avenue
at 2:45, okay?

20:13.066 --> 20:14.734
Why should I?
Want to be in

20:14.734 --> 20:16.100
a children's home
until you're 18?

20:16.100 --> 20:18.433
Group home on Union has
a climbing wall.

20:18.433 --> 20:19.367
Carl...

20:19.367 --> 20:20.667
(sighs)
I don't have a bike.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.166
Wire cutter's
in the junk drawer.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.000
What...?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.066
Steve, Fiona,
you guys have to get Debs

20:37.066 --> 20:38.367
to take that kid back.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.333
I don't know that
I can make that happen.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.133
Fiona, you have to,
or else we're all fucked.

20:42.133 --> 20:44.000
Okay.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.033
Why do I have to do it?

20:46.033 --> 20:47.266
Because we've already
told the police

20:47.266 --> 20:48.600
we don't know
anything about it.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.700
I'm not a good liar.

20:49.700 --> 20:50.734
You can do this.

20:50.734 --> 20:52.467
I'm not!
You always say so!

20:52.467 --> 20:55.367
Oh, hey, you know what, Debs?
It's been hours,

20:55.367 --> 20:57.533
and Casey's parents are probably
really worried about him.

20:57.533 --> 21:00.700
You remember that pie
you wanted to make?

21:00.700 --> 21:02.166
Let's do that tonight.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.300
What do I have to do?

21:05.300 --> 21:08.000
I saw a little boy walking down
Southport Avenue

21:08.000 --> 21:09.300
at, like, 2:45.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.700
2:45?
Yeah, 2:45!

21:11.700 --> 21:13.333
Asshole.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.533
Got a sighting.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.367
Kid saw the boy walking
down Southport.

21:16.367 --> 21:18.233
DEBBIE:
I was walking up
Southport Avenue

21:18.233 --> 21:19.433
when I saw little Casey.

21:19.433 --> 21:21.033
Nah--
you didn't know his name.

21:21.033 --> 21:22.567
A little boy.

21:22.567 --> 21:23.633
Yeah.
All alone.

21:23.633 --> 21:24.600
All alone...

21:24.600 --> 21:25.734
and crying.

21:25.734 --> 21:27.166
I asked her
where her mom went.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.333
Not her.

21:28.333 --> 21:29.567
Oh, um, I asked him

21:29.567 --> 21:31.066
where his mom was.

21:31.066 --> 21:32.433
And she didn't know.

21:32.433 --> 21:35.433
He seemed upset,
so I gave him some chocolate.

21:35.433 --> 21:37.300
Good, Debs.
You're doing great.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.133
LIP: All right, Veronica,
I want you to go

21:39.133 --> 21:40.533
to the cleaners,
ask Mrs. Bergdoll

21:40.533 --> 21:42.367
to use the phone
in the back.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.467
That woman's a cold bitch.
I've got something
for that, okay?

21:44.467 --> 21:46.333
Don't worry about it.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.166
Hey, Mrs. B., can I use

21:48.166 --> 21:50.000
your phone
really quick?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.734
I got some green bud
for your glaucoma.

21:51.734 --> 21:54.066
Mm...!

21:54.066 --> 21:55.500
I saw a little boy
with a Superman

21:55.500 --> 21:57.000
suit walking down Grand Avenue.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.400
What time was that?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.567
About 15 minutes ago.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.734
And I thought,
maybe this is the little boy

22:01.734 --> 22:02.667
everyone's been talking about.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.000
I'm sorry--

22:04.000 --> 22:05.066
a Spider-Man suit?

22:05.066 --> 22:06.467
I didn't say Spider-Man;
I said Superman.

22:06.467 --> 22:09.166
He had a cape and he was walking
with a little girl.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.433
Can you describe the--
Asshole.

22:11.433 --> 22:14.333
DEBBIE: So I went to the phone
outside Connie's Pizza

22:14.333 --> 22:15.767
and called the police.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.767
But I couldn't use the phone,
because it was broken.

22:23.266 --> 22:25.233
And did you try
to call anyone else?

22:25.233 --> 22:26.433
Yes, I did.

22:26.433 --> 22:28.133
Oh. Right.

22:28.133 --> 22:29.633
I was standing on the street,

22:29.633 --> 22:31.533
and I asked people
who were passing

22:31.533 --> 22:33.100
if I could use their phone.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.567
I said it was an emergency,
but no one listened.

22:35.567 --> 22:39.200
I don't know if it was
because I was young or...

22:39.200 --> 22:40.567
Oh!

22:40.567 --> 22:41.767
Poor!

22:49.367 --> 22:51.367
(newscast plays
indistinctly in distance)

22:53.200 --> 22:55.433
Ha-ha-ha-ho.

23:00.667 --> 23:02.400
Okay, let's see...

23:04.533 --> 23:06.133
(gasps anxiously)

23:06.133 --> 23:07.467
(sighs)

23:09.266 --> 23:10.367
Frank?!

23:10.367 --> 23:13.300
Oh... what am I gonna do?

23:15.567 --> 23:17.600
Stop?

23:24.533 --> 23:25.734
(groans quietly)

23:25.734 --> 23:27.200
(unzips)

23:31.533 --> 23:33.400
(farting)

23:33.767 --> 23:35.266
Hi, Frank.

23:35.266 --> 23:36.266
Shit!

23:36.266 --> 23:38.100
Sorry! Karen!

23:38.100 --> 23:39.367
I thought you were gone.

23:39.367 --> 23:40.667
Frank?

23:40.667 --> 23:42.000
Pass me a towel?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.467
(wry laugh)

23:49.333 --> 23:51.033
You got it all wet.

23:51.033 --> 23:53.567
A hand towel is fine.

23:53.567 --> 23:56.033
And don't throw it, please.

24:17.166 --> 24:18.633
Casey!

24:20.000 --> 24:21.266
(heavy sigh)

24:21.266 --> 24:22.567
Kev, what time you
going to work today?

24:22.567 --> 24:25.200
Uh, I go in at 6:00.
You're going in early.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.767
You should go in,
tell them you saw

24:26.767 --> 24:28.333
a little boy
in a Superman costume

24:28.333 --> 24:29.600
walking down Grand Avenue.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.233
What are you doing here?
You're not on till 6:00.

24:32.233 --> 24:34.133
But I'm here now;
what's the harm?

24:34.133 --> 24:35.600
Gary! How you doin', man?
Hey!

24:35.600 --> 24:37.467
Another Old Style?
Yep.

24:37.467 --> 24:38.700
Gosh, you know what?

24:38.700 --> 24:42.200
I am feeling nostaglic today.

24:45.166 --> 24:46.400
Did you hear what I said?

24:46.400 --> 24:48.100
Said I was feeling nostalgic.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.200
MAN:
What's nostalgic?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.500
Well, I'm glad you asked.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.266
I was walking to work,
and I saw this cute little kid

24:53.266 --> 24:55.066
wearing a Superman costume.

24:55.066 --> 24:57.033
You know,
with the cape and everything?

24:57.033 --> 24:58.467
Takes you back.
He was a cute kid.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.734
Yeah, Superman costume.

25:03.734 --> 25:05.133
Cute little kid.

25:05.133 --> 25:07.300
A little kid in a
Superman costume?

25:07.300 --> 25:08.467
Superman costume.
Sandy hair.

25:08.467 --> 25:09.633
That's the little boy
that's missing.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.734
Where did you see him?

25:10.734 --> 25:12.700
On Grand. I just passed him,
like, five minutes ago.

25:12.700 --> 25:15.000
Well, we have to
call that in, Kev.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.433
Yes, we do!

25:18.433 --> 25:20.100
Hey, how's my
favorite lady doing?

25:20.100 --> 25:22.300
Well, she'll be better when her
Powerball numbers come up,

25:22.300 --> 25:24.066
and Allied Shippers can
kiss her fine black ass.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.567
(both laughing)

25:25.567 --> 25:27.667
Yeah, I got a good
feeling on that one.
You say that every week.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.233
Four vodka tonics?

25:29.233 --> 25:30.300
No, only three today.

25:30.300 --> 25:31.667
Marilyn wants a virgin colada.

25:31.667 --> 25:34.266
She blacked out last night,
so she a little nervous.

25:36.100 --> 25:39.333
No, no, no, no, if I can't buy
my girlfriend's mom drinks,

25:39.333 --> 25:41.633
what good am I?
No damn good.

25:41.633 --> 25:43.734
That's right.
Can I get these for you?

25:43.734 --> 25:45.133
No. I got 'em.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.433
(giggling)

25:52.433 --> 25:53.700
Ladies, how you doing?

25:53.700 --> 25:55.533
I'm just gonna grab
these glasses-- that okay?

25:55.533 --> 25:57.133
You can grab anything
of mine you like.

25:57.133 --> 25:59.266
What's your name?
Kev.

25:59.266 --> 26:03.266
Kev. That's nice and short
and easy to whisper, like...

26:03.266 --> 26:05.633
(whispering):
Do it again, Kev.

26:05.633 --> 26:08.233
(laughing):
Uh-huh... yeah...

26:08.233 --> 26:10.100
Mr. Barkeep...

26:10.100 --> 26:12.133
a large boilermaker.

26:14.433 --> 26:15.700
And keep 'em comin'.

26:17.567 --> 26:20.066
Hey, did you bring in the water
heater from the back porch?

26:20.066 --> 26:21.734
No.
Well, it's not
on the porch.

26:21.734 --> 26:23.600
Seriously.

26:29.166 --> 26:31.700
Bunch of fucking animals.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.300
Steve, Debbie, Liam,
we gotta go.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.133
Fiona, you got
Casey, all right?

26:35.133 --> 26:36.533
I'll see you
at Sheila's after.

26:36.533 --> 26:39.100
Hey, don't worry,
she's gonna do great.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.700
She doesn't even
seem sorry.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.567
Nah, she is.
She's just a kid.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.633
She can't tell lies.
She never could.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.033
We're all going to jail.

26:49.033 --> 26:50.600
Why can't I just
take Casey back now?

26:50.600 --> 26:53.734
We can't let anybody see you,
with Casey, leaving our house.

26:53.734 --> 26:56.233
Look, Fiona is gonna take
Casey to the rendezvous spot.

26:56.233 --> 26:57.433
She'll give him
to you and then

26:57.433 --> 26:59.333
you'll take him back
to his house from there.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.000
Otherwise,
the plan won't work.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.600
Fiona is gonna
go to Shiela's,

27:02.600 --> 27:04.633
to make sure
she has an alibi.

27:04.633 --> 27:06.367
I don't think
I can do this.

27:06.367 --> 27:08.734
Yeah, you're gonna
be great, Debs.

27:08.734 --> 27:12.066
Just... don't fuck it up.

27:17.066 --> 27:17.734
Hey, Debs...

27:17.734 --> 27:19.066
Yeah?

27:19.066 --> 27:20.333
Do you know why doctors,

27:20.333 --> 27:22.600
lawyers and nurses
are great liars?

27:22.600 --> 27:24.033
No.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.567
Because they lie
to help people.

27:25.567 --> 27:27.233
Like, a doctor wouldn't
tell a sick patient,

27:27.233 --> 27:29.000
"Too bad, you're gonna die."

27:29.000 --> 27:31.066
He would say, "We're doing
everything we can," wouldn't he?

27:31.066 --> 27:33.200
(hesitantly):
Yeah...

27:33.200 --> 27:35.333
So, pretend you're
being a doctor today,

27:35.333 --> 27:37.500
and tell a doctor's
kind of lie.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.066
Can you be
a doctor for me?

27:39.066 --> 27:41.734
Can I be a nurse?

27:41.734 --> 27:43.734
That's my girl.

27:43.734 --> 27:47.066
(sirens wailing in distance)

27:47.066 --> 27:49.133
ANCHORWOMAN: In just a moment,
we will take you live

27:49.133 --> 27:50.533
to the scene of the crime,

27:50.533 --> 27:53.166
with our field correspondent
Charles Catino.

27:53.166 --> 27:55.500
But first,
if you have any information

27:55.500 --> 27:57.633
regarding the whereabouts
of Casey Casden,

27:57.633 --> 28:00.500
please call the number
at the bottom of your screen.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.433
Charles, are you there?

28:01.433 --> 28:03.533
(women laughing loudly)

28:03.533 --> 28:05.767
(laughing, screaming)

28:05.767 --> 28:07.667
Shots on me!

28:10.367 --> 28:11.500
You are soaking wet!

28:14.400 --> 28:16.567
(women laughing,
squealing)

28:19.767 --> 28:22.033
(stammering)

28:22.033 --> 28:25.100
Uh, so... fixing up
the basement.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.367
Mm-hmm. Gonna try.

28:26.367 --> 28:28.633
Sheetrock that corner
space for my bed.

28:28.633 --> 28:31.667
The other half's already
paneled, so I'm good there.

28:31.667 --> 28:34.433
Got a spot for the sink;
toilet's already in.

28:34.433 --> 28:39.266
So, just run some cable for the
flat-screen, and I'm all set.

28:39.266 --> 28:42.400
So...

28:42.400 --> 28:45.500
that Sheila,
she's something, huh?

28:45.500 --> 28:48.166
That's one way to put it.

28:50.266 --> 28:52.133
Does your ass
ever stop hurting?

28:52.133 --> 28:55.300
No.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.600
Advil's your best bet.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.667
Helps with the
inflammation.

29:00.266 --> 29:02.100
Hey, Kev.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.567
Hey.
You see my friend?

29:03.567 --> 29:06.400
I know she acts like she hits
on everyone, but she's doesn't.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.533
She likes you.

29:08.533 --> 29:10.500
Well, I'm flattered,
but I can't.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.734
Kev, you wanna get to it?

29:12.734 --> 29:14.500
Oh, come on, what can
one little drink hurt?

29:14.500 --> 29:15.500
Um, uh...

29:15.500 --> 29:18.166
yeah... really, no.

29:18.166 --> 29:20.633
Look, she doesn't care
if you have a girlfriend.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.500
Neither do I.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.734
Can you handle two?

29:28.433 --> 29:29.633
What, the both of you?

29:31.266 --> 29:32.734
(clears throat)

29:32.734 --> 29:34.567
Uh, I can't, really.

29:34.567 --> 29:37.734
Actually, um...
I'm getting married.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.467
What-What-What's that, now?
Married?!

29:40.467 --> 29:42.367
No, no, no, Frank...
Frank, can I get you a shot?

29:42.367 --> 29:43.367
Veronica?

29:43.367 --> 29:44.300
Frank, it...

29:44.300 --> 29:45.500
Hey, Jess!

29:45.500 --> 29:47.300
(slurring):
Roll out the champagne!

29:47.300 --> 29:49.166
Our boy here is getting hitched!

29:49.166 --> 29:50.166
What?!

29:50.166 --> 29:51.633
Kev is marrying Veronica!

29:51.633 --> 29:54.400
Frank!
Carol! Carol!

29:54.400 --> 29:55.700
Carol, come here!

29:55.700 --> 29:57.166
No, no, Frank... Frank...
Carol, where are you?

29:57.166 --> 29:58.700
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, Fr...

29:58.700 --> 30:00.300
Carol!
No, no, no, no, no! Frank!

30:00.300 --> 30:02.300
Kev's making an honest woman
out of your daughter!

30:02.300 --> 30:04.467
You what?!
Yeah!

30:04.467 --> 30:05.533
CAROL: Oh, my God!
(laughing)

30:05.533 --> 30:06.734
And to think I was
over there, drinking,

30:06.734 --> 30:08.467
worried about
that missing boy.

30:08.467 --> 30:10.734
Who gives a shit
about that now?
Hey!

30:10.734 --> 30:13.400
My daughter's getting married!
Kev's getting married
to Veronica!

30:13.400 --> 30:15.233
(all whooping, yelling)

30:15.233 --> 30:18.300
And I got the oldest
bottle of Asti Spumanti!

30:18.300 --> 30:20.633
Oh!

30:20.633 --> 30:24.500
You have made me... the
happiest woman in the world.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.066
I'm gonna go call Veronica.

30:26.066 --> 30:27.066
Wait, wait! No.

30:27.066 --> 30:28.300
She'll want to call you.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.533
You don't want
to ruin the surprise.

30:29.533 --> 30:31.100
Okay, everybody,

30:31.100 --> 30:32.500
drinks on the house!

30:32.500 --> 30:33.767
(cheering, whistling, whooping)

30:33.767 --> 30:37.033
Here you go--
one for the mama!

30:37.033 --> 30:38.166
There you go!

30:38.166 --> 30:40.133
All right, one for the
big daddy-- now for the mama.

30:40.133 --> 30:41.767
There we go!

30:41.767 --> 30:42.767
Yeah!

31:06.367 --> 31:08.333
(slurping loudly)

31:08.333 --> 31:10.767
(straw squeaking)

31:10.767 --> 31:13.400
Fiona Gallagher?!

31:13.400 --> 31:16.367
Yeah. Yeah, what about her?

31:16.367 --> 31:17.533
Nothing.

31:17.533 --> 31:18.567
Good.

31:18.567 --> 31:20.233
(straw squeaks)

31:20.233 --> 31:22.000
(slurps)

31:22.000 --> 31:23.300
(straw squeaks)

31:23.300 --> 31:25.734
You really wanna
hook up with her?

31:25.734 --> 31:27.467
A lot of kids over there, man.

31:27.467 --> 31:29.400
You're kidding, right?

31:29.400 --> 31:30.767
Your marriage only
lasted six weeks.

31:30.767 --> 31:31.667
Seven.

31:31.667 --> 31:33.266
And she wound up
with the house.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.533
My car's paid off!

31:35.533 --> 31:38.400
You giving me advice
is ridiculous.

31:38.400 --> 31:41.734
(slurping)

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
(sucking silently)

31:55.400 --> 31:57.767
(TV newscast playing
indistinctly)

31:57.767 --> 31:59.433
Fiona...

31:59.433 --> 32:03.100
what a pleasant surprise.

32:05.133 --> 32:06.633
So they haven't
found him yet?

32:06.633 --> 32:08.400
(sighs heavily)

32:08.400 --> 32:09.734
I can't stop
thinking about

32:09.734 --> 32:12.433
what his parents
must be going through.

32:12.433 --> 32:14.700
I know.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.767
(sighs sadly)

32:18.333 --> 32:20.533
Do you want a drink?

32:20.533 --> 32:22.533
I've got a lot of booze.

32:22.533 --> 32:24.000
No mixers.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.567
Cup of coffee would be great.

32:28.367 --> 32:29.767
Why don't I make it?

32:31.133 --> 32:34.100
Oh, don't mind me.

32:34.100 --> 32:38.367
I accidentally took three
of my pills instead of one.

32:38.367 --> 32:41.633
(newscast continuing
indistinctly)

32:41.633 --> 32:43.600
Hey, wait a second...

32:45.166 --> 32:46.367
Hiya, mister.

32:46.367 --> 32:47.767
Hey, there.

32:50.100 --> 32:53.066
How about giving me
a big hug?

32:57.734 --> 32:59.233
(marker squeaking)

33:00.633 --> 33:03.500
I'm gonna blush,
and then they'll know!

33:03.500 --> 33:05.333
I can't be a nurse.
I'm not patient.

33:05.333 --> 33:06.600
I hate bedpans.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.033
I can't walk in clogs.

33:08.033 --> 33:10.333
And let's face it,
I'm too small!

33:13.467 --> 33:14.633
Peek-a-boo!

33:17.767 --> 33:20.200
Peek-a-boo...
Oh, my God!

33:25.633 --> 33:26.600
Mommy!

33:26.600 --> 33:28.533
Casey's back!

33:28.533 --> 33:30.100
I don't believe it!

33:30.100 --> 33:31.500
Is it him?
Mommy!

33:31.500 --> 33:33.233
It is!

33:33.233 --> 33:34.100
He's back.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.667
(sobbing) My baby!

33:39.667 --> 33:43.633
Where have you been?
We've been worried
sick about you!

33:43.633 --> 33:45.233
Where did you find him?

33:45.233 --> 33:46.667
He was walking all by himself.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.433
I didn't know where he lived.

33:48.433 --> 33:49.533
Thank you.
You're an angel.

33:49.533 --> 33:50.633
I don't, I don't...

33:50.633 --> 33:52.700
I don't know how
to thank you.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.500
Uh, here, just, uh...

33:54.500 --> 33:56.467
Here, take-take
all-- take it.

33:56.467 --> 33:58.100
Take all of it.
Just take everything.

33:58.100 --> 34:02.300
Thank you.
Thank you.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.033
I told you we'd find him.

34:04.033 --> 34:06.734
My Debbie found him!
A Gallagher saved the day!

34:06.734 --> 34:08.333
You bunch of losers.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.300
Bye!

34:16.033 --> 34:17.734
That's Deb's.

34:17.734 --> 34:21.000
No, I-I'm just helping her.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
Hey! You're on my hand.
You're...

34:26.600 --> 34:29.000
All right, I am your father.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.100
Hey, Deb. Good job.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.333
Fiona, you want to come
with us, please?

34:33.333 --> 34:34.433
Where?

34:34.433 --> 34:36.000
We need to take Deb
to the station.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.567
What for?

34:37.567 --> 34:39.400
We need to take a statement.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.667
Well, she-she found him.

34:41.667 --> 34:43.500
I mean, isn't that enough?

34:43.500 --> 34:45.200
We need a statement.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.600
You can stay with her.

34:46.600 --> 34:50.266
Nurse Debbie can handle it.

34:50.266 --> 34:52.166
What I'm trying
to tell you is

34:52.166 --> 34:58.500
that I have never seen
her love anybody--

34:58.500 --> 35:01.233
I mean, anybody--

35:01.233 --> 35:05.567
Oh...
no-- anybody as much
as she loves you.

35:05.567 --> 35:06.567
For real?

35:06.567 --> 35:07.600
I'm for real.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.266
Including her daddy.

35:10.266 --> 35:12.066
No!
Mm-hmm.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.667
Come on.

35:13.667 --> 35:18.567
Ooh, and honey,
she love him... Mm!

35:18.567 --> 35:22.433
Whoo! Mm-mmm.

35:24.633 --> 35:27.567
Oh, shit.

35:36.133 --> 35:37.433
V!

35:37.433 --> 35:39.367
V!

35:42.166 --> 35:44.400
V!

35:44.400 --> 35:46.767
V!

35:46.767 --> 35:49.133
Can you hear me?

35:49.133 --> 35:50.500
I need to speak
to Veronica Fisher.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.400
What the hell?!

35:55.667 --> 35:57.000
What are you doing?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.066
I'm here
to tell you something.

35:59.066 --> 36:02.367
I mean, I need
to ask you something.

36:02.367 --> 36:05.100
How did you get so drunk in
the middle of the afternoon?

36:09.567 --> 36:12.767
Veronica Fisher, will you do me
the honor of being my wife?

36:12.767 --> 36:15.734
Yes! Yeah!

36:15.734 --> 36:18.200
(Kevin groans)

36:18.200 --> 36:19.633
I love you, baby.

36:19.633 --> 36:21.533
I love you!
(laughs)

36:22.767 --> 36:24.500
I first saw him on Southport.

36:24.500 --> 36:27.233
He caught my eye because my baby
brother Liam loves Superman.

36:27.233 --> 36:28.200
After I noticed

36:28.200 --> 36:30.233
he was alone,
I took his hand.

36:30.233 --> 36:32.200
He's a very good walker

36:32.200 --> 36:33.433
and very well-mannered
for a toddler.

36:33.433 --> 36:36.400
I thought for sure someone
would let me use their phone.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.734
You know, I'm just so shocked
at the lack of humanity.

36:38.734 --> 36:40.100
Yes, I'd love a cookie.

36:40.100 --> 36:43.033
I remember Grand Avenue
from my Aunt Ginger.

36:43.033 --> 36:44.400
Do they require you

36:44.400 --> 36:47.567
to wear a jacket and tie
or is that your choice?

36:47.567 --> 36:49.100
I find it very fetching!

37:03.533 --> 37:05.133
Big day.

37:05.133 --> 37:06.767
Yeah.

37:06.767 --> 37:08.266
Happy ending.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.567
Yep.

37:11.567 --> 37:15.467
You missed
a good pot roast last week.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.266
My mom really
pulled out all the stops.

37:20.066 --> 37:22.266
Yeah...

37:22.266 --> 37:24.266
I'm sorry about that.

37:34.266 --> 37:35.734
KAREN:
That's so great

37:35.734 --> 37:37.700
about Debbie finding
that little Casey.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.233
Yeah, I know.

37:39.233 --> 37:42.600
He was lucky it was her
and not some crazy fucker.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.467
I like
your new jeans.

37:44.467 --> 37:45.700
Oh, thanks.

37:45.700 --> 37:48.133
They didn't cheer me up
as much as I'd hoped.

37:48.133 --> 37:49.467
My house is
so fucking weird.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.166
I wish I'd been kidnapped.

37:51.166 --> 37:53.166
Is it that bad?

37:53.166 --> 37:55.033
Yeah. You should have
seen him at breakfast.

37:55.033 --> 37:57.333
I can't imagine
what dinners are
gonna be like.

37:57.333 --> 37:59.700
And, in fact,
as soon as he gets
down to the bottom,

37:59.700 --> 38:01.767
I look back and there are
all these people behind us,

38:01.767 --> 38:04.033
Yes.
and I start yelling,
"Go back! Go back!"

38:04.033 --> 38:06.033
Why? (laughs)

38:06.033 --> 38:07.333
Because he stepped
off of the thing,

38:07.333 --> 38:09.133
and he just stopped there.

38:09.133 --> 38:10.667
And there are all
of these people...

38:10.667 --> 38:12.100
Oh, thank you.

38:12.100 --> 38:15.200
You know, your house is
Frank's wet dream.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.233
Never gonna get
him out.

38:19.266 --> 38:21.066
Wanna sneak into
my backyard

38:21.066 --> 38:23.467
and do it on
the tire swing?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.200
Lip?

38:25.200 --> 38:26.667
Wait, I'm thinking.

38:26.667 --> 38:29.767
REPORTER (on TV):
Well, I guess sometimes
there are happy endings.

38:29.767 --> 38:31.533
Casey Casden, the little boy
who disappeared

38:31.533 --> 38:33.200
from his own front yard
earlier today

38:33.200 --> 38:37.467
has been delivered home
safe and sound.

38:37.467 --> 38:39.300
ANCHORMAN: Oh, thank you, Lisa.
That is indeed great, great...

38:39.300 --> 38:40.333
(whispering):
Fiona!

38:40.333 --> 38:43.100
♪ ♪

38:48.066 --> 38:50.000
What's up?

38:51.367 --> 38:53.333
Um, for Debbie.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.567
Okay. Mm-hmm.

39:01.100 --> 39:04.200
Hey, Debs, look
what Steve bought.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.367
Oh, my God!

39:06.700 --> 39:08.233
Absolutely.

39:08.233 --> 39:09.667
For doing
such a great job today.

39:09.667 --> 39:10.767
Thank you!

39:10.767 --> 39:12.000
What you gonna name her?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.233
(laughing)
Gin-Gin.

39:14.233 --> 39:16.200
After Aunt Ginger.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.667
Let's go up to my room.
We can play!

39:17.667 --> 39:20.100

Oh, Gin-Gin,

Kevin, wake up.

39:41.233 --> 39:43.400
It's time to get drunk again.

$690, $700,

39:48.533 --> 39:53.200
$710, $715 exactly.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.433
Hmm... Ah.

(groans)

40:05.700 --> 40:10.066
(sighs)

40:10.066 --> 40:11.734
Thanks for buying
her that doll.

40:11.734 --> 40:14.767
No. Not a problem.

40:14.767 --> 40:18.133
You know what would
feel great right now?

40:18.133 --> 40:21.133
Hmm?
A long, hot shower.

40:21.133 --> 40:23.033
I'll wash your back.

40:28.533 --> 40:31.400
Shit.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.467
No hot water.

40:36.166 --> 40:38.500
You really
are beautiful.

40:44.433 --> 40:47.300
I hope I'm not
fucking up the kids.

40:49.567 --> 40:51.300

Fiona!

41:02.467 --> 41:04.333
Yeah!

Mommy!

(laughing)

41:08.066 --> 41:10.166
What the hell?
Champagne?

41:10.166 --> 41:12.333
I'm getting married.

41:22.200 --> 41:25.333
(everyone talking, laughing)

41:30.266 --> 41:32.133
She's great.

41:32.133 --> 41:34.066
Yeah, man.

41:34.066 --> 41:35.233
She's a good egg.

41:35.233 --> 41:37.333
She deserves it.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.667
Yeah, but does she
deserve you, you bastard?

41:39.667 --> 41:41.333
(chuckles)

41:41.333 --> 41:44.367
No. Nobody does.

42:05.367 --> 42:06.767
Take the Advil now.

42:06.767 --> 42:09.166
You want to stay
ahead of the pain.

42:10.633 --> 42:12.700
(sighs)

42:14.433 --> 42:18.166
(music blaring over
indistinct conversation)

42:23.233 --> 42:25.433
(laughter,
conversation continue)

42:27.000 --> 42:29.133
Penny for your
thoughts.

42:29.133 --> 42:30.300
Really, Grandma?

42:30.300 --> 42:31.533
I know.

42:31.533 --> 42:35.066
I'm a 60-year-old lady
with the vaj of a newborn.

42:35.066 --> 42:37.066
(spluttering laugh)

42:37.066 --> 42:38.066
(laughing)

42:40.266 --> 42:42.200
You know I love you
guys, right, Kev?

42:42.200 --> 42:44.266
I couldn't raise these
kids without you and V.

42:44.266 --> 42:46.200
I know they borrow
your shit all the time.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.300
I'm sorry.
I know it's lame.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.533
But thanks. (kisses)

42:49.533 --> 42:51.667
I don't know how I'd do it
without you guys.

42:51.667 --> 42:53.266
And I just
love you so much.

42:53.266 --> 42:55.000
I'm just so happy
for you both.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.200
You know that Jagermeister
really makes you chatty.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.033
Right? You know that?

43:00.033 --> 43:03.066
(laughing)

43:03.066 --> 43:04.400
Look at V.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.300
Isn't she beautiful?

43:07.300 --> 43:10.633
Yeah... She sure is.

43:10.633 --> 43:12.567
(beeping in distance)

43:15.033 --> 43:16.567
What the hell is that?

43:21.433 --> 43:22.633
Debbie?

43:29.567 --> 43:31.700
It's our new
water heater.

43:31.700 --> 43:33.066
I got it on sale.

43:33.066 --> 43:34.066
(all laughing)

43:34.066 --> 43:36.233
And free delivery.

43:36.233 --> 43:37.734
He said
because I'm a hero.

43:37.734 --> 43:40.100
You are my girl!

43:40.100 --> 43:42.100
Oh, man.

43:42.100 --> 43:45.200
You're gonna go to the back and
you're gonna make a sharp left.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.033
And install it in the kitchen.

43:47.033 --> 43:49.700
Take it in the kitchen.
Go straight down.

43:49.700 --> 43:54.700
DEBBIE: By the way, I
call the first hot shower.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.100
That was something, huh?

43:57.100 --> 43:58.734
Yeah.

44:01.333 --> 44:03.467
You know, for a guy
who just got engaged,

44:03.467 --> 44:05.633
you don't seem very happy
to be getting married.

44:09.333 --> 44:11.500
That's 'cause
I'm already married.

44:56.767 --> 44:59.467
Debs, you've got
to get ready for school.

44:59.467 --> 45:02.700
I can't go to school.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.533
Why not?

45:04.533 --> 45:09.633
Gin-Gin had me up half the night
with diarrhea.
