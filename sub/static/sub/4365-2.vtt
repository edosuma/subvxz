WEBVTT

00:00.022 --> 00:01.405
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

00:01.430 --> 00:03.854
You're guilty of bribing
a foreign government

00:03.855 --> 00:05.106
to get your pipeline.

00:05.157 --> 00:07.208
Guilty as charged.

00:07.275 --> 00:08.555
You think
you're not replaceable?

00:08.577 --> 00:10.161
I've been doing this
before I met you,

00:10.245 --> 00:13.531
and I'll be doing it long after
I've forgotten all about you.

00:13.615 --> 00:14.665
Please don't do this.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.034
Your beloved associates
are mine.

00:17.119 --> 00:19.670
What you want is
a long, drawn-out trial

00:19.755 --> 00:20.988
that puts our stock
in the toilet.

00:21.039 --> 00:22.123
I'm here to tell you

00:22.174 --> 00:23.624
he's recusing himself
from the case.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.492
So he appointed
a special prosecutor.

00:25.544 --> 00:28.546
I win, you back me
for managing partner.

00:28.630 --> 00:30.464
You want
to take down Jessica.

00:30.515 --> 00:32.216
Yes, I do.

00:35.137 --> 00:37.271
Holy shit.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.724
Was that a good "holy shit"
or a bad "holy shit"?

00:39.808 --> 00:42.009
Harvey, you just told me
that you're planning a coup.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.644
Give me a second
to figure that out.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.513
Not a coup.
It's a move.

00:46.565 --> 00:48.032
And when you're done
with your lecture--

00:48.116 --> 00:49.367
No.
No lecture.

00:49.451 --> 00:52.903
I just have one question.

00:52.988 --> 00:56.157
Do I get my own office?

00:56.208 --> 00:57.658
Harvey, if you want
to be managing partner

00:57.709 --> 00:59.076
and Darby
agreed to back you,

00:59.161 --> 01:00.628
then I'll follow you
to the ends of the earth.

01:00.695 --> 01:02.747
But before we start,
I want to make sure

01:02.831 --> 01:04.632
you're ready to do this
to Jessica.

01:04.699 --> 01:06.634
I am.

01:06.701 --> 01:10.971
Then let's go beat the shit
out of Cameron Dennis.

01:11.039 --> 01:12.473
I know you don't want
to see me.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.308
And yet--

01:14.375 --> 01:15.726
I just wanted
to let you know that I got

01:15.811 --> 01:18.045
a copy of the letter that
Jessica blackmailed me with,

01:18.096 --> 01:19.546
and I made it clear to her
that I would take it

01:19.598 --> 01:21.432
to the D.A.
if she ever threatened me,

01:21.516 --> 01:23.017
so what I did
will never happen again.

01:23.068 --> 01:25.552
Never should have happened
in the first place.

01:25.604 --> 01:26.720
Close the door
on your way out.

01:26.772 --> 01:29.723
Donna and I
have work to do.

01:34.729 --> 01:38.199
There's a harsh reality
I need to inform you of,

01:38.250 --> 01:40.668
and it's a bitter pill
to swallow.

01:40.735 --> 01:43.737
But the truth is,
a mistake was made.

01:43.789 --> 01:45.706
A fatal mistake.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.908
And as much
as I hate to admit it,

01:47.959 --> 01:51.679
our time together is done.

01:51.746 --> 01:54.348
No more work,

01:54.415 --> 01:56.517
no more laughter.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.803
Remember?

02:00.188 --> 02:01.188
No more mentorship

02:01.256 --> 02:05.142
and, um, no more anything.

02:05.227 --> 02:08.195
See, I reached too high,
and I fell.

02:08.263 --> 02:10.364
And my punishment is the end
of my tenure

02:10.431 --> 02:13.117
as head of the associates.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.986
So I would like to leave you

02:16.071 --> 02:18.489
with the immortal sentiment

02:18.573 --> 02:21.575
of Robin Williams.

02:21.626 --> 02:23.828
There have been
other associates before you.

02:23.912 --> 02:26.947
They believed they
were destined for great things,

02:26.998 --> 02:28.332
just like you.

02:28.416 --> 02:33.170
If you just listen,

02:33.255 --> 02:37.091
you can hear 'em whisper
their legacy to you.

02:37.142 --> 02:39.426
Carpe diem.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.181
Seize the day, people.

02:44.266 --> 02:47.268
Make your legal lives
extraordinary.

02:47.319 --> 02:49.520
Oh, Captain,
my Captain.

02:53.742 --> 02:55.159
There was a time
I would've been relieved

02:55.243 --> 02:58.412
to see that--
no more Louis.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.446
It's just wrong.

02:59.498 --> 03:01.148
This whole merger
is wrong.

03:01.199 --> 03:03.150
How'd it go with Harvey?

03:03.201 --> 03:04.201
It didn't.

03:04.286 --> 03:05.152
Did you tell him
about Jessica?

03:05.203 --> 03:07.755
Yeah.
He didn't care.

03:09.624 --> 03:10.791
What?

03:10.842 --> 03:13.093
I just wish I could give you
a hug right now,

03:13.161 --> 03:15.930
but I can't because we still
want to keep us quiet.

03:15.997 --> 03:17.998
Well, come on.
You can give me a hug.

03:18.049 --> 03:19.600
Something could've happened.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.520
Something bad,
like a...

03:22.604 --> 03:23.554
My dog could've died.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.189
Oh, you have a dog now?

03:25.273 --> 03:28.142
I was really close
to this dog.

03:28.193 --> 03:30.194
Well, the best way
to get over the death of a dog

03:30.278 --> 03:31.645
is to get a new one.
Mmmm.

03:31.696 --> 03:32.980
- No?
- No.

03:33.031 --> 03:34.348
I'm just--I'm just too upset.

03:34.399 --> 03:36.367
I'm--I don't know
if I'm ready

03:36.451 --> 03:38.903
for a new fake dog
right now.

03:38.987 --> 03:40.037
- Okay.
- Yeah.

03:40.121 --> 03:42.039
Just leave me
like this.

03:46.717 --> 03:49.836
How did it go?

03:52.840 --> 03:55.275
I don't know.
Awful.

03:55.342 --> 03:56.893
Probably the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

03:56.977 --> 03:58.194
Louis, we just merged,

03:58.279 --> 04:01.197
and I wish I could undo
you losing the associates,

04:01.282 --> 04:02.782
but I can't.

04:02.850 --> 04:04.234
What I can do

04:04.318 --> 04:06.653
is take
what you've been giving

04:06.704 --> 04:09.205
to so many for so long

04:09.290 --> 04:11.074
and have you channel it
into one.

04:11.158 --> 04:12.959
You mean...

04:13.026 --> 04:15.962
I want you to mentor
your own associate.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.334
Finally.

04:21.385 --> 04:25.371
The D'Artagnan to my Athos,
Porthos, and Aramis.

04:25.423 --> 04:27.590
All for one
and one for all.

04:27.675 --> 04:29.926
<i>En garde!</i>

04:30.010 --> 04:32.345
Sorry.

04:32.396 --> 04:35.398
Jessica, wait.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.317
I can have anyone?

04:37.384 --> 04:39.903
Louis, take your pick
of the litter.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.192
- Good morning, Ms. Paulsen.
- Spit it out.

04:46.243 --> 04:47.660
Is that any way to start
the day?

04:47.728 --> 04:49.112
You want something.

04:49.196 --> 04:50.363
I need the 411
on the breakup.

04:50.414 --> 04:52.415
- Are we in high school?
- Life is high school.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.566
And I need to know
if the prom king

04:53.617 --> 04:55.919
and his boy wonder
are still an item.

04:56.003 --> 04:57.203
What high school
did you go to?

04:57.237 --> 04:58.955
Donna,
it's a simple question.

04:59.039 --> 05:01.291
Did Mike and Harvey
<i>break up</i> break up,

05:01.375 --> 05:04.043
or did they take a time-out
and, like, say to each other,

05:04.095 --> 05:06.546
"hey, let's see other people
and make sure that we're sure."

05:06.597 --> 05:09.048
I see what's going on here.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.467
Jessica feels sorry
for you,

05:10.551 --> 05:11.885
so she's given you
your pick of the liter.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.252
And now you're sniffing
around here,

05:13.304 --> 05:15.271
trying to put the moves on Mike
behind Harvey's back.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.316
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I would never do that.

05:17.391 --> 05:19.476
No, that's why I'm here
to ask permission.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.927
So ask him.

05:20.978 --> 05:21.978
Well, I think
it might go better

05:22.062 --> 05:23.029
coming
from a different source.

05:23.096 --> 05:24.898
- You want me to ask him.
- Yeah.

05:24.949 --> 05:25.932
Would you please?
No.

05:25.983 --> 05:27.033
Why?

05:27.100 --> 05:28.034
Because it would be
so much more fun

05:28.101 --> 05:30.737
for me to listen to you
ask him.

05:30.788 --> 05:31.821
Well, let me
get this straight.

05:31.906 --> 05:33.490
You want my permission
to take Mike

05:33.574 --> 05:35.208
and force him to be
your associate.

05:35.275 --> 05:36.993
No, I would never force him
to do anything.

05:37.077 --> 05:38.161
It has to be consensual.

05:38.245 --> 05:41.447
Not like Sally Jones
and senior prom.

05:41.499 --> 05:43.416
Wait a second.
Did you just admit to a crime?

05:43.467 --> 05:45.752
No, a crime was committed
upon me.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.954
Okay, I don't want to,
but I have to.

05:48.005 --> 05:49.806
What crime?

05:49.890 --> 05:52.959
My mom felt bad for Sally,
so she forced me to take her.

05:53.010 --> 05:56.563
Well, what was so bad
about her?

05:56.630 --> 06:00.400
She had four nipples.

06:00.467 --> 06:02.569
Okay, if that date
was so bad,

06:02.636 --> 06:04.938
I mean,
how did you find that out?

06:04.989 --> 06:05.939
Okay, you know what,
Harvey,

06:05.990 --> 06:07.574
do I have your blessing
or not?

06:07.641 --> 06:09.108
Knock yourself out,
Louis.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.693
See, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

06:10.778 --> 06:12.745
You're just saying that because
you think he's gonna say no.

06:12.813 --> 06:15.615
- Oh, I know he'll say no.
- Well, I know you're wrong.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.649
So you better think
about this very carefully,

06:16.700 --> 06:18.501
because once permission
is given,

06:18.586 --> 06:20.987
you cannot go back.

06:21.038 --> 06:22.672
Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

06:22.756 --> 06:25.157
Fine.
He's yours.

06:25.209 --> 06:27.510
I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.213
Good, 'cause
when I'm done with him,

06:30.297 --> 06:34.601
Mike Ross will be begging
to be my associate.

Well, well,
what a surprise.

07:11.163 --> 07:12.413
Jessica.

07:12.497 --> 07:13.864
Last time we saw each other,

07:13.915 --> 07:15.950
you were blackmailing me
out of my job.

07:16.034 --> 07:17.501
Here to do it again?

07:17.569 --> 07:18.953
Because you gave me
what you had on me.

07:19.037 --> 07:20.588
I just want
to make one thing clear.

07:20.672 --> 07:23.907
What I did to you,
I did to you.

07:23.959 --> 07:25.040
Don't take it out
on Harvey.

07:25.076 --> 07:27.077
Oh, that's sweet.

07:27.129 --> 07:29.079
Like a mother
protecting her cub.

07:29.131 --> 07:31.248
Take me on
anytime you want,

07:31.300 --> 07:33.134
but don't punish
Harvey's client

07:33.218 --> 07:34.435
for what I did.

07:34.519 --> 07:36.420
You did?

07:36.471 --> 07:39.807
You just happened on evidence
from his time

07:39.891 --> 07:42.476
at the D.A.'s office?

07:42.561 --> 07:44.729
Oh.

07:44.780 --> 07:47.097
Ah.
The redhead.

07:47.149 --> 07:48.449
Well, it doesn't matter,

07:48.533 --> 07:50.701
because he may not have been
the one to betray me,

07:50.769 --> 07:52.069
but he didn't stop it.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.071
So after you threw him
under the bus and I saved him,

07:54.122 --> 07:55.823
he should have thrown himself
back under the bus?

07:55.907 --> 07:57.208
You just don't get it.

07:57.275 --> 07:58.609
Yes, I do.

07:58.660 --> 07:59.877
What you're really pissed at

07:59.944 --> 08:01.945
is that he chose me
over you.

08:01.997 --> 08:03.464
Not you.
What you are.

08:03.548 --> 08:04.948
I put bad guys away.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.116
You try to figure out

08:06.168 --> 08:07.168
how to let them do
whatever they want.

08:07.252 --> 08:08.552
So don't come in here
telling me

08:08.620 --> 08:11.472
that I'm taking something out
on Harvey's client,

08:11.556 --> 08:13.290
because I'll tell you
something--

08:13.342 --> 08:16.293
she did this.

08:19.798 --> 08:21.015
You made me a mixed tape.

08:21.099 --> 08:23.634
Watch it,
and then make me an offer,

08:23.685 --> 08:25.236
which I'll reject
because...

08:25.303 --> 08:27.988
I got your client
dead to rights.

08:32.327 --> 08:35.496
Mmm, mmm.

08:35.580 --> 08:36.813
Well?

08:36.865 --> 08:39.250
This is the best steak
I've ever had in my life.

08:39.317 --> 08:41.202
That is the best steak
you <i>will</i> ever have

08:41.285 --> 08:42.535
in your life.

08:42.621 --> 08:44.087
As much as I appreciate
for once

08:44.155 --> 08:47.174
not having to eat my lunch
from the hot dog stand,

08:47.259 --> 08:48.426
what are we doing here?

08:48.493 --> 08:50.845
Can't a man
just take out another man

08:50.929 --> 08:52.663
in the middle of the day
for some steak and some wine

08:52.714 --> 08:55.433
and some cheesecake that's
gonna knock your socks off?

08:55.500 --> 08:57.301
Uh, some men could.

08:57.352 --> 09:00.020
But I think you and I
both know

09:00.105 --> 09:01.472
that you are not one
of those men.

09:01.523 --> 09:03.023
- True that.
- Mm.

09:03.108 --> 09:04.024
Want some more wine?

09:04.109 --> 09:05.359
Don't mind if I do.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.444
And you gotta
try this cheesecake.

09:06.511 --> 09:08.562
Oh, no, Louis, I'm--
mm--

09:08.647 --> 09:10.197
You know what I mean, right?
What do you think of that?

09:10.282 --> 09:11.849
Hey, Louis! How was the steak?

09:11.900 --> 09:13.117
- Heaven.
- How about you?

09:13.184 --> 09:14.535
Best steak you ever had?

09:14.619 --> 09:17.321
Uh, best steak
I <i>will</i> ever have.

09:17.372 --> 09:18.689
You taught him well.

09:18.740 --> 09:20.374
What are you guys,
brothers?

09:21.493 --> 09:22.576
Oh, I'm just kidding.

09:22.661 --> 09:24.528
Louis here's got
a lovely sister, Esther,

09:24.579 --> 09:25.663
two wonderful parents.

09:25.714 --> 09:26.914
Who the hell are you?

09:26.998 --> 09:29.800
I am Mike Ross.
Louis and I work together.

09:29.868 --> 09:31.669
I wanted him to know
who he was working for.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.036
- Oh.
- And I would like you to know

09:33.088 --> 09:34.138
who's working for you.

09:34.205 --> 09:35.473
'Cause Mike here,

09:35.540 --> 09:36.841
he's the best steak
you'll ever have.

09:36.892 --> 09:38.375
You want to know
what you're working for?

09:38.427 --> 09:42.146
Tina, Gina, Adrian.

09:42.213 --> 09:43.647
They've been here 50 years
between them.

09:43.715 --> 09:47.101
They are my family.

09:47.185 --> 09:50.654
That's
what you're working for.

09:50.722 --> 09:52.656
II understand.

09:55.610 --> 09:57.778
I do not understand.

09:57.863 --> 09:58.913
Eminent domain.

09:58.997 --> 10:00.998
- Shit.
- Final hearing's Tuesday.

10:01.065 --> 10:03.501
If we don't win, this place
becomes a shopping center.

10:03.568 --> 10:04.735
Then this place
becomes a shopping center,

10:04.786 --> 10:06.754
because nobody wins
eminent domain cases.

10:06.838 --> 10:09.423
But what if we did,
Mike?

10:09.508 --> 10:10.591
Then he'd get to keep
his restaurant.

10:10.675 --> 10:13.043
He would get to keep
his dream,

10:13.094 --> 10:17.548
and I would get to keep
my dream.

10:17.599 --> 10:20.100
- And what is that?
- To rewrite the law.

10:20.185 --> 10:21.135
And the way to do that

10:21.219 --> 10:22.603
is to win
an un-winnable case.

10:22.687 --> 10:24.605
What do you need me to do?

10:27.392 --> 10:28.526
You went to see Cameron?

10:28.593 --> 10:30.194
I was just coming
to apologize.

10:30.261 --> 10:31.301
For interfering
on my case.

10:31.363 --> 10:32.429
He's pissed at you.

10:32.481 --> 10:33.614
He's going to take it out
on Ava.

10:33.698 --> 10:34.815
I wanted to let him know
the person

10:34.900 --> 10:36.367
he should be pissed at
is me.

10:36.434 --> 10:37.368
Well,
it's not gonna stop him

10:37.435 --> 10:38.869
from taking it out
on Ava.

10:38.937 --> 10:40.154
Which is why
I was coming to apologize.

10:40.238 --> 10:41.238
Are you also going
to apologize

10:41.289 --> 10:42.990
for sending the message
that I need you

10:43.074 --> 10:44.708
to help me fight
my battles for me?

10:44.776 --> 10:45.910
I don't want
to fight Cameron for you.

10:45.961 --> 10:47.711
I want to fight Cameron
with you.

10:47.779 --> 10:49.129
When the evidence
is stacked against you,

10:49.214 --> 10:51.715
you do what O.J. did--
you hire the dream team.

10:51.783 --> 10:53.801
Oh, that's our bar?
O.J.?

10:53.885 --> 10:56.387
Did he walk or not?

10:56.454 --> 10:57.388
Fine.

10:57.455 --> 10:59.974
But I'm Johnnie Cochran.

11:02.644 --> 11:03.594
You know.

11:03.645 --> 11:04.678
You know I know.

11:04.763 --> 11:05.846
Mike told me.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.297
Nobody had to tell me
after you sent me

11:07.349 --> 11:09.633
on that wild goose chase
after <i>American Gigolo.</i>

11:09.684 --> 11:10.818
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:10.902 --> 11:12.403
You know, it's not
that you violated

11:12.470 --> 11:13.971
the sanctity
of our friendship.

11:14.022 --> 11:17.140
It's that you violated
the sanctity of Richard Gere--

11:17.192 --> 11:18.242
something
I would like to do,

11:18.309 --> 11:19.693
but not the way
you did it.

11:19.778 --> 11:21.862
Look, I was just trying
to get Mike back with Harvey.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.247
I understand.

11:23.314 --> 11:24.982
Because I never want
their thing to be our thing.

11:25.033 --> 11:26.200
It's not.

11:26.284 --> 11:27.918
And the way to keep it
from becoming our thing

11:27.986 --> 11:29.620
is to stop talking about them.
Done.

11:29.671 --> 11:32.122
So you and Mike.

11:32.173 --> 11:33.757
I know.
It's a lot.

11:33.825 --> 11:34.792
Do you want to talk
about it?

11:34.843 --> 11:36.093
Of course I do.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.378
Okay, I think
we should start

11:37.462 --> 11:39.513
with the most important
emotional question.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.049
Okay.

11:45.804 --> 11:47.104
I'm actually
getting worried for you.

11:47.171 --> 11:48.331
You don't know
the half of it.

11:55.564 --> 11:57.781
Louis, you said 5:00.
It's only 4:30.

11:57.849 --> 11:59.567
I've been here
since we ate.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.368
I've been researching
every eminent domain case

12:01.453 --> 12:02.987
ever tried,
starting with 1905.

12:03.038 --> 12:04.204
Clark v. Nash.

12:04.289 --> 12:05.205
I thought you wanted me
to be doing

12:05.290 --> 12:06.523
the research?
I did.

12:06.575 --> 12:09.827
But if I don't do it too,
how can I help you?

12:09.878 --> 12:10.828
You're helping me?

12:10.879 --> 12:12.195
Yeah.
I help you help me.

12:12.247 --> 12:14.214
That's how it works.

12:14.299 --> 12:15.716
Help me help you.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.967
What?

12:17.035 --> 12:20.370
Help me help--
it's <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

12:20.422 --> 12:23.007
- Jerry Mc-what?
- You--

12:23.058 --> 12:24.842
okay, if you've gone
over every case file,

12:24.893 --> 12:26.560
then you know
that the reason nobody wins

12:26.645 --> 12:28.545
is because there is no chink
in the armor.

12:28.597 --> 12:31.882
Well, then we make
a chink of our own.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.157
If I'm on a jury,

12:40.224 --> 12:42.159
I'm looking at a bribe,
plain as day.

12:42.226 --> 12:44.161
Because that's exactly
what it is.

12:44.228 --> 12:45.195
I don't care
what it looks like.

12:45.246 --> 12:46.614
There's no audio.

12:46.698 --> 12:47.915
It's our story
versus theirs.

12:47.999 --> 12:50.000
It's a shady deal
and a case full of cash.

12:50.068 --> 12:51.418
Their story is going
to be more compelling.

12:51.503 --> 12:54.254
Cameron's not going
to risk trial without more.

12:54.339 --> 12:56.406
- Do you think he has audio?
- What would it say?

12:56.458 --> 13:00.010
It would have this gentleman,
Colonel Mariga,

13:00.078 --> 13:01.462
asking if we had
the money

13:01.546 --> 13:03.847
and my number two, Nick Howell,
showing it to him.

13:03.915 --> 13:06.083
Then he would thank us
for paying

13:06.134 --> 13:08.052
a pollution remediation fee.

13:08.103 --> 13:10.087
That sounds
environmentally sound.

13:10.138 --> 13:11.355
Except we'd already
remediated everything

13:11.422 --> 13:13.590
that needed
to be remediated.

13:13.642 --> 13:15.476
Which is how you knew
it was a bribe.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.061
- Yes.
- Hmm.

13:17.112 --> 13:18.145
The question is,

13:18.229 --> 13:20.147
did you ever use
that word in that room?

13:20.231 --> 13:21.598
I may be brazen,
Mr. Specter,

13:21.650 --> 13:23.033
but I am not a fool.

13:23.101 --> 13:25.452
Then the audio
won't help them anyway.

13:25.537 --> 13:27.037
The Colonel?

13:27.105 --> 13:29.707
No, they're still in power.
He's not getting indicted.

13:35.246 --> 13:36.714
What?

13:36.781 --> 13:38.499
Cameron's got your protege.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.501
No.

13:40.585 --> 13:42.285
I've been grooming Nick
for ten years.

13:42.337 --> 13:44.171
I've taught him everything
he knows.

13:44.255 --> 13:45.806
Like how to bribe
a foreign government?

13:45.890 --> 13:49.309
That is not the same.
He would never turn on me.

13:49.394 --> 13:50.844
You'd be surprised
what people you trust

13:50.929 --> 13:52.980
would do when someone
puts them in a position

13:53.064 --> 13:56.400
where they think
they don't have a choice.

13:56.467 --> 13:59.737
Harvey's right.

13:59.804 --> 14:01.689
Once someone puts
another person down the path

14:01.773 --> 14:03.807
of bending the law,

14:03.858 --> 14:04.858
people tend to turn
on each other.

14:04.943 --> 14:06.143
You don't know him.

14:06.194 --> 14:08.445
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

14:08.496 --> 14:09.663
A few days ago.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.532
Call him.
He won't take your call.

14:11.616 --> 14:13.117
You're wrong.

14:13.168 --> 14:16.319
He always takes my calls.

14:16.371 --> 14:18.172
Hi, it's Nick.
Leave a message.

14:18.256 --> 14:21.208
Let me tell you
what that message really said.

14:21.292 --> 14:22.843
"Hi, Ava.
It's Nick.

14:22.927 --> 14:24.887
"I'm not here right now
because I'm cutting a deal

14:24.929 --> 14:27.047
to sell you out."

14:32.829 --> 14:34.944
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:35.518 --> 14:36.735
How's it going with Louis?

14:36.820 --> 14:39.488
You know,
it's actually not bad.

14:39.539 --> 14:40.706
But the truth is,

14:40.790 --> 14:42.625
I would rather be--

14:42.692 --> 14:43.826
- No.
- What? Come on.

14:43.877 --> 14:45.211
It's the middle
of the night.

14:45.295 --> 14:46.212
Louis could be back
at any minute.

14:46.296 --> 14:47.913
- I can be fast.
- I know.

14:47.998 --> 14:51.366
That was a one-time thing.

14:54.170 --> 14:56.422
Mm, mm, mm.
Enough, enough.

14:56.506 --> 14:58.891
But I--
okay.

14:58.975 --> 15:01.227
Yeah, you're probably right.

15:01.311 --> 15:02.761
The last person
we want catching us is Louis.

15:02.846 --> 15:03.896
Did it ever occur to you

15:03.980 --> 15:05.481
that's he's trying
to recruit you?

15:05.548 --> 15:06.682
Can we just
for once assume

15:06.733 --> 15:09.235
that Louis doesn't have
an ulterior motive?

15:09.319 --> 15:12.938
I got us
some refreshments.

15:13.023 --> 15:16.659
I will leave you two
to your work.

15:16.726 --> 15:18.160
- So?
- Yeah.

15:18.227 --> 15:20.062
Louis, it's the middle
of the night.

15:20.113 --> 15:21.229
Where did you get all this?

15:21.281 --> 15:24.250
I'm the new quartermaster,
remember?

15:24.334 --> 15:25.618
Okay.

15:25.702 --> 15:28.454
Here, check this out.

15:30.540 --> 15:32.758
Whoa, no one's thought
to come at it this way.

15:32.842 --> 15:34.376
Mike, this is outstanding.

15:34.427 --> 15:36.411
I actually got the idea
from a movie.

15:36.463 --> 15:38.914
- <i>Moneyball.</i>
- <i>I thought you hated sports.</i>

15:38.965 --> 15:39.965
<i>Moneyball</i>
<i>isn't about sports.</i>

15:40.050 --> 15:41.171
- It's about math.
- Exactly.

15:41.217 --> 15:43.135
One problem.
It's outside the scope.

15:43.219 --> 15:45.604
- What if it weren't?
- What if I could fly?

15:45.689 --> 15:46.722
Well, I can't help you
with that.

15:46.773 --> 15:47.806
But if we want to get it
in the scope,

15:47.891 --> 15:48.941
we just have to get
the other side

15:49.025 --> 15:51.644
to put it there for us.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:02.322 --> 16:04.373
Morning.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.325
Nice Mustang, Harvey.

16:06.409 --> 16:08.627
I see you're still trying
to be Steve McQueen.

16:08.712 --> 16:09.778
Not trying.

16:09.829 --> 16:11.413
Being.

16:11.464 --> 16:14.282
This is the scene
where he corners the asshole.

16:14.334 --> 16:16.418
Speaking of movies,
did you enjoy

16:16.469 --> 16:17.803
the one that I sent over?

16:17.887 --> 16:20.288
It's not often we get
the whole crime on film.

16:20.340 --> 16:23.509
All you have is a silent film
with no proof of anything.

16:23.593 --> 16:25.094
And by the way, I'm going
to have you sanctioned

16:25.145 --> 16:26.294
for withholding evidence.

16:26.346 --> 16:28.797
I gave you that video
in a timely manner.

16:28.848 --> 16:30.182
You gave us that video,

16:30.266 --> 16:31.684
so we'd take our eyes
off Nick.

16:31.768 --> 16:33.852
Nick who?

16:33.937 --> 16:36.405
The Nick you have stashed
in a hotel room somewhere.

16:36.472 --> 16:37.573
Oh, that Nick.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.074
Now that you mention it,

16:39.142 --> 16:42.494
I probably should put him

16:42.579 --> 16:44.780
on my witness list.

16:44.831 --> 16:46.982
I'm a little
out of practice.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.118
Yeah.

16:49.169 --> 16:51.120
There you go.

16:51.171 --> 16:53.622
Now...
Why don't you get

16:53.673 --> 16:57.325
that piece of shit
out of my driveway, okay?

16:59.512 --> 17:01.797
The first time
I ever had steak,

17:01.848 --> 17:04.215
it was at Peter's.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.667
I mean,
I'd had steak before...

17:06.720 --> 17:10.105
But I never
<i>had</i> steak before.

17:10.173 --> 17:11.773
But that's not
why I'm here today.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.392
You see,
halfway through the meal,

17:13.476 --> 17:14.609
Peter came
over to my table,

17:14.676 --> 17:17.529
and he asked
how I'd liked it.

17:17.614 --> 17:19.513
He wanted to know
because he cared.

17:19.566 --> 17:21.400
He cared about me.

17:21.483 --> 17:24.236
I don't make friends
very easily,

17:24.319 --> 17:26.622
but the second I set foot
in Peter's Steakhouse,

17:26.689 --> 17:29.074
I had made a friend
for life.

17:29.159 --> 17:31.193
And that is how Peter
treats every single person

17:31.244 --> 17:32.294
who walks
through his door.

17:32.361 --> 17:33.712
So I don't care
what they say.

17:33.797 --> 17:36.999
Your Honor,
this is not a public benefit.

17:37.050 --> 17:41.336
Your Honor, I'm...
I'm touched.

17:41.388 --> 17:42.638
He makes me want to run
right over there

17:42.705 --> 17:44.306
and get a steak.

17:44.373 --> 17:46.308
But as for the Supreme Court
decision in Kelo,

17:46.375 --> 17:48.310
public benefit is determined
on a quantitative,

17:48.377 --> 17:50.045
not qualitative basis.

17:50.096 --> 17:51.730
Well, I'm glad
you brought up Kelo,

17:51.815 --> 17:54.316
because we happen to have
some quantitative evidence

17:54.383 --> 17:55.317
right here.

17:55.384 --> 17:57.269
Kelo was decided in 2005.

17:57.353 --> 17:59.021
Eight years later
and still,

17:59.072 --> 18:01.023
nothing has been built
on this land.

18:01.074 --> 18:03.776
No jobs created, no taxes
collected, no money made.

18:03.860 --> 18:05.694
Zero quantitative benefit.

18:05.745 --> 18:08.447
Just because they say
it will be better

18:08.531 --> 18:10.165
doesn't mean
it actually will be.

18:10.233 --> 18:13.419
Even if it were true,
we have every right to do it.

18:13.503 --> 18:16.088
The state determines benefit,
not the court,

18:16.172 --> 18:17.539
and until such time
as the law is changed,

18:17.590 --> 18:19.241
you have no authority to affect
the state's determination.

18:19.292 --> 18:20.876
Uh, Your Honor, you can
establish authority today.

18:20.927 --> 18:22.044
There's no basis for that.

18:22.095 --> 18:23.429
You have no choice
but to uphold

18:23.513 --> 18:26.265
the established practice
of eminent domain.

18:26.349 --> 18:28.517
I'm afraid opposing counsel
is right.

18:28.584 --> 18:31.804
Demolition begins next week.

18:33.273 --> 18:35.808
I just remembered something
about <i>Moneyball.</i>

18:35.892 --> 18:39.778
The A's never actually
won the World Series.

18:39.863 --> 18:41.429
I'm sorry, Louis.

18:41.481 --> 18:42.865
Now is not the time
to be sorry.

18:42.932 --> 18:45.367
What is it the time for?

18:45.434 --> 18:47.236
Get in.

18:47.287 --> 18:49.955
Nah, I think I'm good.

18:50.039 --> 18:52.207
Mike, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

18:52.275 --> 18:54.209
It's just good, clean mud.

18:54.277 --> 18:56.078
That doesn't make
any sense.

18:56.129 --> 18:57.379
Is this about the fact
that I'm in the nude?

18:57.446 --> 18:59.131
Please don't harp on that.

18:59.215 --> 19:00.582
Yeah, I'm just saying,
I know

19:00.633 --> 19:01.800
how the younger generation
gets hung up on that stuff,

19:01.885 --> 19:03.051
but you don't have to worry

19:03.119 --> 19:04.386
because you have
your own self-contained unit.

19:04.453 --> 19:07.389
Okay, if I get in,
will you stop saying words?

19:16.483 --> 19:17.844
You know,
if you go in with boxers,

19:17.851 --> 19:19.131
you're not gonna
have them later.

19:19.152 --> 19:22.154
You're gonna have
to go smokeless.

19:33.032 --> 19:35.650
That disloyal piece
of filth.

19:35.702 --> 19:37.252
Believe me,
I know how you feel.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.820
Do you?

19:38.872 --> 19:41.206
Because I've heard you prefer
to work alone.

19:41.291 --> 19:43.041
Well, I don't.

19:43.126 --> 19:44.993
I may have been above him
when we started,

19:45.044 --> 19:46.328
but for the last two years,

19:46.379 --> 19:48.463
we worked together
side by side.

19:48.515 --> 19:51.383
I'm not a sentimental person,
but it meant something to me,

19:51.467 --> 19:53.028
and I thought it meant
something to him.

19:53.052 --> 19:56.221
- He deserves to be shot.
- He does.

19:56.306 --> 19:58.440
But I suggest
we promote him instead.

19:58.507 --> 19:59.808
You want to give him
a new title

19:59.859 --> 20:01.276
to keep him
from testifying?

20:01.344 --> 20:04.530
I believe it will require
a substantial raise as well.

20:04.614 --> 20:05.697
You know
that's not what I meant.

20:05.782 --> 20:07.115
You're suggesting
bribing a man

20:07.183 --> 20:08.483
to get you
out of your bribery charge.

20:08.535 --> 20:10.819
"In for a penny,
in for a pound,"

20:10.870 --> 20:12.321
mother always said.

20:12.372 --> 20:14.790
This is
what Cameron wanted.

20:14.857 --> 20:17.042
He didn't give us that video
so we wouldn't find Nick.

20:17.126 --> 20:19.328
He gave us Nick,
so you'd try to bribe him.

20:19.379 --> 20:21.079
Well,
how can you know that?

20:21.164 --> 20:22.864
Because Cameron knows
people are who they are.

20:22.916 --> 20:25.033
You bribed once,
you'll bribe again.

20:25.084 --> 20:26.385
Well, then what are you
suggesting I do?

20:26.469 --> 20:27.836
Because I'm going to make
a run at him.

20:27.887 --> 20:31.924
No, I'm gonna
make a run at him.

20:37.263 --> 20:39.565
Louis.

20:39.649 --> 20:41.316
Yeah?

20:41.384 --> 20:43.685
This is the best damn mud
I've ever had.

20:43.736 --> 20:46.388
Hey, I--

20:48.524 --> 20:50.442
I know why you picked me
for this case.

20:50.526 --> 20:52.327
I wouldn't have picked you
if you didn't.

20:52.395 --> 20:54.062
If you wanted me to be
your associate,

20:54.113 --> 20:55.948
why didn't you just ask?

20:56.032 --> 20:56.999
Because you would've
said no.

20:57.066 --> 20:59.868
- Louis, come on.
- No, Mike.

20:59.919 --> 21:01.370
I know what people
think of me,

21:01.421 --> 21:03.071
and I know
what you think of me.

21:03.122 --> 21:04.572
I knew you'd remember

21:04.624 --> 21:06.008
all the bad things
about working with me.

21:06.075 --> 21:07.626
I just wanted to remind you
of some of the good ones.

21:07.710 --> 21:09.511
I remember
all the good ones,

21:09.578 --> 21:11.263
but I also remember
after those things,

21:11.347 --> 21:12.881
you going back to being

21:12.932 --> 21:14.967
the same Louis I met
the first day of work.

21:15.051 --> 21:17.769
The Louis who fired someone
right in front of my face

21:17.854 --> 21:20.922
for the sole purpose
of teaching me to be afraid.

21:20.974 --> 21:23.859
You're right.

21:23.926 --> 21:27.112
I remember you once said
that my actions matter

21:27.196 --> 21:28.897
and that it's not water
under the bridge.

21:28.948 --> 21:30.699
You've changed me.

21:30.766 --> 21:33.318
You make me want to be
a better man.

21:33.403 --> 21:35.570
Wait, are you saying
I complete you?

21:35.622 --> 21:37.205
You have seen <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

21:37.273 --> 21:38.707
No, I'm quoting
my cinema hero,

21:38.774 --> 21:40.942
the character of Melvin Udall,
expertly portrayed

21:40.994 --> 21:42.577
by Jack Nicholson
in <i>As Good As It Gets.</i>

21:42.629 --> 21:44.963
- Oh. Never saw it.
- Oh, well, then you're lucky.

21:45.048 --> 21:46.381
Why is that?

21:46.449 --> 21:47.749
Because you can still see it
for the first time.

21:52.138 --> 21:53.171
The first time.

21:53.256 --> 21:54.973
- Yeah.
- That's it, the first time.

21:55.058 --> 21:56.791
- What?
- The judge.

21:56.843 --> 21:58.927
You were making your argument
about the first time.

21:58.978 --> 22:00.858
He wanted to rule in our favor,
but he couldn't.

22:00.930 --> 22:02.898
I know, that's why we need him
to rewrite the law.

22:02.965 --> 22:04.149
No, we don't,
because there's already

22:04.233 --> 22:06.318
a provision in the law
that works for us.

22:06.402 --> 22:07.569
It's in section--
No, no, no, no.

22:07.636 --> 22:10.322
First of all,
I cannot mix work

22:10.406 --> 22:11.907
with mudding, okay?

22:11.974 --> 22:12.908
Let's hit the showers.

22:12.975 --> 22:14.660
I can't wait to stick it

22:14.744 --> 22:16.244
to opposing counsel.

22:16.312 --> 22:18.246
Do you need me to give you
a hand out of there?

22:24.334 --> 22:26.719
I know who you are.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.021
You shouldn't be here.

22:28.105 --> 22:29.939
No, Nick.
You shouldn't be here.

22:30.007 --> 22:30.940
I'd like you to go.

22:31.008 --> 22:33.276
No.
You wouldn't.

22:33.343 --> 22:34.727
You'd like to give me
five minutes

22:34.812 --> 22:36.479
to see if I can get you
out of the box you're in

22:36.530 --> 22:39.482
before you sell your soul.

22:44.205 --> 22:47.574
I didn't want to do this.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.192
You wouldn't let me in
if you did.

22:49.243 --> 22:50.877
I had no choice.

22:50.961 --> 22:52.629
Ava's in trouble
whether I testify or not.

22:52.696 --> 22:54.297
That's what Cameron
wants you to believe.

22:54.298 --> 22:57.333
- You haven't seen the video?
- I saw a business transaction.

22:57.384 --> 22:59.586
- You don't believe that.
- I can sell that.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.221
You just got to keep your head
and shut your mouth.

23:01.305 --> 23:02.338
Just do
what you're here to do.

23:02.389 --> 23:03.640
Threaten me,
or offer me a deal.

23:03.707 --> 23:05.975
- I've considered both.
- Cameron said you would.

23:06.043 --> 23:07.894
Cameron's wrong.

23:07.978 --> 23:09.018
I'm not going to do either

23:09.046 --> 23:11.648
because I think
you care about Ava.

23:11.715 --> 23:13.516
I do.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.602
Then think about this.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.403
Whatever deal
Cameron offered you,

23:17.488 --> 23:19.689
it's based on a lie.
He doesn't have anything.

23:19.740 --> 23:21.724
He's just trying to use
your fear

23:21.775 --> 23:23.276
to pit you against Ava.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.640
Look, I've seen it happen
before,

23:24.695 --> 23:27.197
and the one thing
I can tell you is

23:27.248 --> 23:28.865
you go through with it,
you'll regret it

23:28.916 --> 23:29.999
for the rest of your life.

23:30.067 --> 23:31.834
Because she'll
never forgive me.

23:31.902 --> 23:35.004
Because you'll never
forgive yourself.

23:37.407 --> 23:39.542
Okay, what is so important
that we need

23:39.593 --> 23:41.010
to have
an emergency hearing?

23:41.078 --> 23:43.246
Your Honor, we need to be
heard before demolition starts.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.337
What's he going to do now,

23:44.381 --> 23:45.598
tell us
about his first demolition?

23:45.683 --> 23:47.133
It was riveting,
but this has nothing to do that.

23:47.218 --> 23:48.801
Your Honor,
based on the new zoning

23:48.886 --> 23:50.046
put through
for their project,

23:50.087 --> 23:52.055
we're simply asking
for a revised valuation

23:52.106 --> 23:54.807
of the property
that they're taking.

23:57.528 --> 23:58.778
$100 million?

23:58.862 --> 24:00.280
That valuation
has no basis.

24:00.364 --> 24:01.814
It has
a mathematical basis.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.816
Specifically, the present
value of future cash flow,

24:03.901 --> 24:05.101
as shown right there.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.602
Bullshit. You've heard
of voodoo economics.

24:06.654 --> 24:07.954
This is voodoo math.

24:08.038 --> 24:10.239
They're making crazy assumptions
to inflate their value.

24:10.274 --> 24:11.607
Just like Kelo,
but that really

24:11.659 --> 24:13.076
didn't seem to bother you
when it was in your favor.

24:13.127 --> 24:14.544
Your Honor,
this is ludicrous.

24:14.611 --> 24:15.712
They're only picking
that number

24:15.779 --> 24:16.663
because they know
it makes our project

24:16.747 --> 24:18.114
too expensive
to be feasible.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.582
Well, in the words
of opposing counsel,

24:19.633 --> 24:22.835
even if that were true,
we have every right to do it.

24:25.222 --> 24:27.257
Hi, Donna.
I love your dress.

24:27.308 --> 24:28.841
And I love
when you compliment me

24:28.926 --> 24:29.892
before you ask
for something.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.511
You're so insightful.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.013
Look, I know we said
Harvey and Mike's problem

24:34.098 --> 24:36.232
isn't our problem,
but Louis is stealing Mike.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.734
It's not stealing
when someone's available

24:37.801 --> 24:38.818
for the taking.

24:38.902 --> 24:40.403
You knew?

24:40.470 --> 24:42.522
When do I not know?

24:42.606 --> 24:44.326
Louis asked
for Harvey's blessing with Mike,

24:44.408 --> 24:45.325
and he gave it.

24:45.409 --> 24:46.576
Why didn't you tell me?

24:46.643 --> 24:47.810
Because we agreed
that their problem

24:47.861 --> 24:49.279
isn't our problem.
I know.

24:49.330 --> 24:50.830
But Harvey
doesn't really want this.

24:50.914 --> 24:53.783
- And you know that because--
- Because he can't.

24:53.834 --> 24:55.785
Look, he needs you
to do your Donna thing

24:55.836 --> 24:57.337
and help him get over it.

24:57.421 --> 25:00.590
Harvey listens to me because
I tell him what I believe.

25:00.657 --> 25:03.509
What do you believe?

25:08.498 --> 25:10.300
That Mike betrayed Harvey.

25:10.351 --> 25:12.552
- Mike was blackmailed.
- And then he betrayed Harvey.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.104
- Donna, how can you--
- How can I what?

25:15.172 --> 25:16.806
I just spent
the last year hiding

25:16.857 --> 25:18.107
your boyfriend's
double life.

25:18.175 --> 25:19.976
I'd say I'm
a pretty understanding person.

25:20.027 --> 25:21.844
But what I don't understand
is when someone

25:21.895 --> 25:22.862
takes loyalty like that,

25:22.946 --> 25:24.680
and they throw it
in the garbage.

25:24.732 --> 25:28.034
Would you like me
to say that to Harvey?

25:28.118 --> 25:30.737
Sorry I asked.
Won't happen again.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.623
- Yeah, that was awesome.
- That was a great job, Mike.

25:33.690 --> 25:35.458
- Thanks, Louis.
- Rachel.

25:35.525 --> 25:38.161
- Looks like you won.
- The judge is ruling tomorrow.

25:38.212 --> 25:40.463
Then what were you
just celebrating?

25:40.530 --> 25:42.298
Well, we were
dead in the water,

25:42.366 --> 25:43.800
and now we have
a fighting chance.

25:43.867 --> 25:47.503
I'm glad.

25:47.554 --> 25:48.671
Is something wrong?

25:48.722 --> 25:51.224
Oh, I just got
into a fight with Donna.

25:51.308 --> 25:52.708
About what?

25:52.760 --> 25:53.893
I went to tell her about you
and Louis, and she just--

25:53.977 --> 25:56.012
You went to Donna
about me and Louis?

25:56.063 --> 25:57.764
- I thought she could help.
- You what?

25:57.848 --> 25:59.349
I thought if she knew,
she'd go to Harvey,

25:59.400 --> 26:00.680
and they'd just put
an end to it.

26:00.717 --> 26:01.984
Someone butting in
and telling him what to do

26:02.052 --> 26:03.603
is only going to push him
further away.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.321
I didn't tell him
what to do.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.440
I went to Donna.
If Donna tells him,

26:07.524 --> 26:08.491
all it says is
that I'm too weak

26:08.558 --> 26:09.992
to fight my own battles.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.341
God, if it's coming from you,
that makes it so much worse.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.247
Why?

26:14.331 --> 26:15.898
What?

26:22.423 --> 26:24.707
Harvey forbid me
to tell you anything.

26:24.758 --> 26:26.709
You and Harvey
talked about me?

26:26.760 --> 26:28.344
After we went out,
I went to him,

26:28.412 --> 26:29.533
I said I wanted
to tell you--

26:29.546 --> 26:30.930
And he said
I wasn't trustworthy.

26:31.014 --> 26:32.098
It's not that.

26:32.182 --> 26:33.099
He didn't want you
to go out with me.

26:33.183 --> 26:34.300
No, it's not that either.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.386
He didn't have a problem
with us going out, he--

26:36.437 --> 26:40.189
Oh, so it's okay if you
screwed me so long as you lied.

26:40.257 --> 26:41.474
Rachel.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.925
Oh, my God.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.477
That's why you cut things
off with me.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.279
- I didn't want to lie to you.
- I can't believe him.

26:46.363 --> 26:47.930
Rachel, he didn't
just risk everything

26:47.981 --> 26:49.365
he had for me once.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.067
When Jessica found out,
he put everything

26:51.118 --> 26:52.985
he had on the line
for me again.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.204
I hope you know as you
stand here defending him,

26:55.272 --> 26:57.623
he has no intention
of ever forgiving you.

26:57.708 --> 27:00.460
Because I found out when Louis
asked Harvey for his blessing,

27:00.544 --> 27:02.328
he said, "Take him.
He's all yours."

27:02.413 --> 27:03.796
So instead
of getting mad at me

27:03.881 --> 27:06.215
for trying to get Harvey
to forgive you,

27:06.283 --> 27:07.216
maybe you should
get pissed at Harvey

27:07.284 --> 27:10.303
and think about moving on.

27:17.478 --> 27:19.312
What the hell
is wrong with you?

27:19.396 --> 27:22.682
I said I was sorry,
I gave back the office,

27:22.766 --> 27:25.268
I helped you with your case,
I even blackmailed Jessica.

27:25.319 --> 27:26.936
Harvey, I get that you
are pissed off at me,

27:26.987 --> 27:28.070
but eventually,

27:28.138 --> 27:29.355
you are going
to have to forgive me.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.441
Forgive you for what,
making me hire Katrina?

27:31.492 --> 27:33.809
Getting high on the job
your first week?

27:33.861 --> 27:35.578
Betraying me
with Jessica?

27:35.645 --> 27:38.614
Or for telling Rachel
about your secret?

27:40.534 --> 27:42.585
You cut me loose.

27:42.652 --> 27:44.003
Okay?
You fired me.

27:44.087 --> 27:46.038
I was at my lowest point.
She was there for me.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.656
She's still there for me.

27:47.708 --> 27:48.758
Congratulations.

27:48.825 --> 27:50.146
I hope you two
are happy together.

27:50.177 --> 27:51.928
So you're gonna punish me
by giving me to Louis?

27:51.995 --> 27:53.429
Well, let me
tell you something.

27:53.497 --> 27:54.630
It failed.

27:54.681 --> 27:56.516
I actually like
working for Louis.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.601
He makes me feel
like I'm working with him,

27:58.668 --> 28:00.303
not for him.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

28:00.354 --> 28:02.054
Because I didn't give you
to Louis as punishment,

28:02.139 --> 28:06.726
I gave you to Louis
because you and I are done.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.845
Harvey,
I regret what I did.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.981
But I'm telling you right now,
you're gonna regret this.

28:12.032 --> 28:15.785
Maybe you didn't hear me.

28:15.852 --> 28:18.488
I said you and I...

28:18.539 --> 28:20.856
We're done.

28:29.032 --> 28:32.335
Whatever it is, I'm not really
in the mood right now.

28:32.386 --> 28:35.671
Harvey,
I know how Cameron works.

28:35.722 --> 28:37.306
He's setting something up.

28:37.374 --> 28:38.925
You think
I don't know that?

28:39.009 --> 28:40.876
He's setting Ava up
to bribe Nick.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.646
- Isn't that what you just did?
- No.

28:43.713 --> 28:45.097
I went to him and told him

28:45.182 --> 28:46.599
he'd regret being disloyal
to her.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.235
Something I know
a little bit about.

28:49.319 --> 28:51.220
Harvey, do you know
what started it

28:51.271 --> 28:52.989
between the Hatfields
and the McCoys?

28:53.056 --> 28:56.659
I didn't catch the miniseries,
but I heard Costner killed it.

28:56.726 --> 28:57.726
Doesn't matter.

28:57.778 --> 28:58.911
Because whoever
they say started it,

28:58.996 --> 29:00.279
I guarantee you,

29:00.364 --> 29:03.783
the other side says,
"bullshit."

29:03.867 --> 29:06.452
You went to Darby
for this merger behind my back.

29:06.537 --> 29:09.905
And then you picked a fight
with him behind my back.

29:09.957 --> 29:12.291
And then you
blackmailed Mike behind mine.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.010
And I was only able
to do that

29:14.077 --> 29:15.845
because you brought a fraud

29:15.912 --> 29:17.413
into my firm
in the first place.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.131
So you do think
it's my fault?

29:19.216 --> 29:22.969
What I think is
I regret where we are,

29:23.053 --> 29:26.022
and I've been trying to get us
back to where we were.

29:26.089 --> 29:27.857
And what would the evidence
of that be?

29:27.924 --> 29:30.226
What evidence
would you like?

29:30.277 --> 29:31.360
Why don't you
tell me the truth

29:31.428 --> 29:34.263
about why the hell
I'm on this case?

29:34.314 --> 29:36.115
All right, Harvey.

29:36.199 --> 29:37.766
I lied to you.

29:37.818 --> 29:40.953
When I told you I fought
to get you on this case,

29:41.038 --> 29:42.121
I didn't.

29:42.205 --> 29:43.739
Darby made that call.

29:43.790 --> 29:47.209
And I used it as an opportunity
to reach out to you.

29:47.277 --> 29:49.545
- "Used."
- To reach out to you.

29:49.613 --> 29:53.299
Which I am now here doing
without using anything.

29:53.383 --> 29:55.051
So do you want
to let it go or not?

29:55.118 --> 29:56.952
I want to know one thing.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.787
If you had it to do over,

29:58.839 --> 30:01.340
would you do it again?

30:02.792 --> 30:06.729
Deposition's on the books
with Cameron tomorrow.

30:06.796 --> 30:09.732
You want me there or not?

30:18.574 --> 30:20.574
Harvey, I'd introduce
you to Nick,

30:20.845 --> 30:22.706
but I understand
you two already met

30:22.707 --> 30:24.240
when you witness-tampered.

30:24.292 --> 30:25.759
Nick works
for Hessington Oil.

30:25.843 --> 30:26.927
We're their lawyers.

30:27.011 --> 30:28.428
Therefore,
I didn't witness-tamper.

30:28.513 --> 30:29.596
And if you say it again,

30:29.681 --> 30:30.681
I'm gonna slap you
with a slander suit.

30:30.748 --> 30:32.883
Well, let me slap you
with something.

30:32.934 --> 30:35.519
Tony Gianopolous got a hold
of that video somehow,

30:35.586 --> 30:36.920
and he gave it
to your shareholders.

30:36.971 --> 30:38.271
They're filing
some sort of lawsuit.

30:38.356 --> 30:39.806
I think he's trying
to take over the company.

30:39.891 --> 30:42.359
You son of a bitch.
You leaked it.

30:42.426 --> 30:43.760
I deny that.

30:43.811 --> 30:45.095
And if your client
says that again,

30:45.146 --> 30:47.481
I will slap her
with a slander suit

30:47.565 --> 30:49.733
to go
alongside her bribery charges.

30:49.784 --> 30:52.335
And by the way,

30:52.403 --> 30:53.570
Nick wasn't swayed

30:53.621 --> 30:56.123
by your attempt to tug
at his heartstrings.

30:56.207 --> 30:57.908
Emotional pleas?

30:57.959 --> 30:59.459
What did you do to him,
Jessica?

30:59.544 --> 31:01.161
This is not the kid
I mentored.

31:01.245 --> 31:03.163
Hold on a sec.

31:03.247 --> 31:05.632
You were never my mentor.
Jessica was.

31:05.717 --> 31:08.552
You're just
a fast-talking car salesman

31:08.619 --> 31:11.088
that hides behind the line,
"I do good."

31:11.139 --> 31:14.141
Now get out of my face
while I confer with my client.

31:19.296 --> 31:20.564
You told me
you knew this man.

31:20.631 --> 31:22.599
I thought
that was an advantage.

31:22.650 --> 31:24.851
Instead, you've goaded him
into orchestrating

31:24.936 --> 31:26.186
an attempt
to take over my company.

31:26.270 --> 31:28.605
You know
how sometimes the doctor says

31:28.656 --> 31:30.607
you're gonna feel worse
before you feel better?

31:30.658 --> 31:33.309
- What are you saying?
- What he's saying is

31:33.361 --> 31:37.280
let us know how you feel
in half an hour.

31:42.486 --> 31:44.671
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:44.756 --> 31:46.006
Do you have a second?

31:46.090 --> 31:47.507
I want to talk to you
about how we left things.

31:47.592 --> 31:50.093
I don't know,
did you run it by Harvey first?

31:50.161 --> 31:51.595
- What?
- I understand

31:51.662 --> 31:54.514
that he has final say on who
his employees fraternize with.

31:55.767 --> 31:57.050
Look.

31:57.135 --> 31:59.553
Harvey wasn't just
trying to protect himself,

31:59.637 --> 32:00.854
Mike, Jessica, and me.

32:00.938 --> 32:02.389
He was also trying
to protect you.

32:02.473 --> 32:05.525
Right, my protection's
at the top of Harvey's agenda.

32:05.610 --> 32:07.611
He barely knows who I am.
Rachel.

32:07.678 --> 32:08.845
And if he did know me,

32:08.896 --> 32:10.313
he would know
that I would never tell anyone.

32:10.364 --> 32:11.398
Okay, look.

32:11.482 --> 32:12.682
You want to be mad
at Harvey, fine.

32:12.733 --> 32:13.984
But you might as well
be mad at me,

32:14.035 --> 32:17.037
because I told Mike
the same thing.

32:17.121 --> 32:19.122
What?

32:19.190 --> 32:20.356
I dragged Mike
into Harvey's office,

32:20.408 --> 32:23.160
and I told him
that Harvey was right.

32:23.211 --> 32:25.361
- That Mike should lie to me?
- No.

32:25.413 --> 32:28.582
I told him
that he should get over you.

32:34.005 --> 32:37.207
Was that before
or after I came to you

32:37.258 --> 32:38.875
and told you
that I kissed him

32:38.926 --> 32:42.095
and that I called him
and told him how I felt?

32:42.180 --> 32:44.181
It was after.

32:44.232 --> 32:45.982
You told him
not to be with me,

32:46.050 --> 32:48.211
and then you let me think
that he didn't care about me.

32:48.219 --> 32:50.904
No,
I told him what I thought,

32:50.988 --> 32:52.105
and then I tried

32:52.190 --> 32:53.710
to help you move on
because their truth

32:53.724 --> 32:54.891
wasn't mine to tell you.

32:54.942 --> 32:55.859
I thought you were my friend.

32:55.910 --> 32:56.943
I am.

32:57.028 --> 32:58.411
You cared more
about protecting Harvey

32:58.496 --> 32:59.446
than protecting me.

32:59.530 --> 33:02.415
Yes, Rachel!
That's my job.

33:05.002 --> 33:09.072
I get that everyone's jobs
are important.

33:09.123 --> 33:11.174
This wasn't about a job
for me.

33:11.242 --> 33:14.127
It was about having a life.

33:14.212 --> 33:17.681
But I guess
you wouldn't understand that.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.468
Rachel...

33:21.552 --> 33:24.804
I'm going to walk away
before you and I can't go back.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.478
It's the second largest
oil deposit found

33:31.562 --> 33:32.946
in the last decade.

33:33.030 --> 33:36.032
We had the contract for it,
but to get it out of the E.I.R.,

33:36.100 --> 33:38.485
we needed the pipeline.
What were you told?

33:38.569 --> 33:39.602
And by whom?

33:39.654 --> 33:41.321
We were told
by Colonel Mariga

33:41.405 --> 33:43.540
we could build the pipeline
if we paid

33:43.607 --> 33:45.709
a pollution remediation fee.
But?

33:45.776 --> 33:46.960
We'd already remediated
everything

33:47.044 --> 33:48.545
that needed
to be remediated.

33:48.612 --> 33:51.915
So what was the fee for?

33:51.966 --> 33:53.466
It was a bribe.

33:53.551 --> 33:55.969
And Ava Hessington
paid this fee

33:56.053 --> 33:58.672
with the full knowledge
that it was a bribe?

33:58.756 --> 34:02.008
Yes, she did.

34:02.093 --> 34:03.643
On this screen here, Nick,

34:03.728 --> 34:06.563
are you sliding
a briefcase full of cash

34:06.630 --> 34:08.514
across the table
to Colonel Mariga?

34:08.599 --> 34:10.934
Yes.

34:10.985 --> 34:13.270
And you were aware
it was a bribe?

34:13.321 --> 34:14.304
Yes, but--

34:14.355 --> 34:17.407
How was Ms. Hessington
as a boss?

34:17.474 --> 34:19.309
She taught me
a great deal.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.411
- Did she trust you?
- I believe so.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.446
- Rely on you?
- Yes.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.480
Did she look
over your shoulder

34:24.532 --> 34:25.748
on everything you did?

34:25.815 --> 34:27.449
No.

34:27.501 --> 34:28.784
Was she aware
of everything you did?

34:28.835 --> 34:30.485
She was aware of this.

34:30.538 --> 34:32.455
Yet all we have
is your word on that.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.007
So let me get this straight.

34:34.091 --> 34:36.626
She groomed you,
promoted you,

34:36.677 --> 34:39.661
gave you autonomy,
then you engineered a bribe.

34:39.714 --> 34:40.797
And when you got caught,

34:40.848 --> 34:42.766
you cut a deal

34:42.833 --> 34:44.967
to lay that bribe
on your mentor.

34:45.018 --> 34:46.436
Is that correct?

34:46.503 --> 34:47.437
She knew.

34:47.504 --> 34:49.723
Yes.
You claimed that before.

34:49.806 --> 34:52.609
If Ava Hessington
were convicted of this crime,

34:52.676 --> 34:54.116
who would be considered
next in line?

34:54.178 --> 34:55.678
That's speculative.

34:55.730 --> 34:57.230
Is it at all possible
it would be you?

34:57.315 --> 35:00.483
Yes.

35:00.534 --> 35:03.870
Wow, sounds like
you have a lot to lose

35:03.955 --> 35:05.521
and even more to gain.

35:05.573 --> 35:07.123
We're not in court.

35:07.191 --> 35:09.492
Your testimony
doesn't help you here.

35:09.543 --> 35:10.827
No, but we wanted
to give you a taste

35:10.878 --> 35:12.362
of what it would be like
in court

35:12.413 --> 35:14.497
when Nick still won't be able
to look her in the eye

35:14.548 --> 35:17.167
when he stabs her
in the back.

35:21.555 --> 35:23.640
We won.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.558
- We did?
- We did.

35:28.012 --> 35:30.347
I just want
to say one thing.

35:30.398 --> 35:31.481
You know,
if Harvey had the power

35:31.548 --> 35:33.383
to become Mariano Rivera,
he would,

35:33.434 --> 35:35.685
because Harvey
doesn't love the law.

35:35.736 --> 35:38.688
It's just his vehicle
for forcing

35:38.739 --> 35:39.779
his will on his opponents,

35:39.824 --> 35:42.025
for winning.

35:42.076 --> 35:43.827
But you see, Mike, that's not
how I feel about the law.

35:43.894 --> 35:46.079
I love the law.

35:46.163 --> 35:47.864
And I'd never trade it
for anything.

35:47.915 --> 35:50.583
I love it too.
I also like winning.

35:50.668 --> 35:53.119
I know.

35:53.204 --> 35:56.089
You know what I think?

35:56.173 --> 35:59.092
I think you're half Harvey
and you're half me.

35:59.176 --> 36:00.844
You've had your time
with him.

36:00.911 --> 36:03.129
Now have your time
with me.

36:08.508 --> 36:09.777
You here for an interview?

36:09.850 --> 36:11.100
They let you go already?

36:11.185 --> 36:12.435
You made your point.

36:12.519 --> 36:14.904
If we go to trial,
you eviscerate Nick.

36:14.988 --> 36:16.155
But we still have that video,

36:16.223 --> 36:19.609
she's on it,
and he says she knew.

36:19.693 --> 36:22.361
And you know what?
The truth is I believe him.

36:22.412 --> 36:24.330
And I'll make them
believe him.

36:24.397 --> 36:27.750
Then why are you here?

36:27.834 --> 36:30.002
Nice job, Harvey.
You got me.

36:30.070 --> 36:31.587
They want you
to cut a deal.

36:31.672 --> 36:33.589
Against my recommendation.

36:33.674 --> 36:35.675
I guess they know
what you don't.

36:35.742 --> 36:37.426
You can't beat me.
Here are our terms.

36:37.511 --> 36:39.578
No, here are my terms.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.214
Our original offer stands.

36:41.265 --> 36:43.132
Hessington Oil
pleads no contest,

36:43.217 --> 36:45.051
we pay a $50-million fine,

36:45.102 --> 36:47.887
and all criminal charges
against Ava are dropped.

36:47.938 --> 36:49.755
They were going
to go for that,

36:49.806 --> 36:52.024
but I convinced them
to make one change,

36:52.092 --> 36:53.943
nonnegotiable.

36:54.027 --> 36:57.446
Ava Hessington
doesn't plead no contest.

36:57.531 --> 36:59.699
She pleads guilty.

36:59.766 --> 37:01.234
And you get
to call it a win.

37:01.285 --> 37:03.619
Well, the record
is going to say guilty.

37:03.704 --> 37:05.121
It <i>is</i> a win.

37:05.205 --> 37:07.073
I can beat you,

37:07.124 --> 37:08.791
and I did,

37:08.875 --> 37:10.626
and it's going
to eat you up.

37:10.711 --> 37:12.611
Dennis, one.

37:12.663 --> 37:16.716
Specter, zero.

37:16.783 --> 37:19.835
Take it or leave it.

37:21.255 --> 37:23.089
- This deal is bullshit.
- Harvey.

37:23.140 --> 37:24.890
Cameron can say
what he wants.

37:24.958 --> 37:26.342
Darby asked you
to take this case.

37:26.426 --> 37:28.094
No way he doesn't
consider this a win.

37:28.145 --> 37:30.012
I don't consider it
a win.

37:30.097 --> 37:31.847
Do you really want to gamble
five years of her life,

37:31.932 --> 37:33.766
so you can prove
you're better than Cameron?

37:33.817 --> 37:35.737
You know as well as I do,
he's only offering this

37:35.802 --> 37:37.486
'cause he knows
he's got a loser.

37:37.571 --> 37:39.305
It's the exact same deal
we offered

37:39.356 --> 37:40.856
with one technical change.

37:40.941 --> 37:42.658
Do you know how they enter
a technical knockout

37:42.743 --> 37:43.776
in the record books?

37:43.827 --> 37:45.861
As a knockout.

37:48.865 --> 37:50.833
I would.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.084
What?

37:52.152 --> 37:55.288
You asked me before
if I'd do it again.

37:55.339 --> 37:56.956
I would.

37:58.458 --> 38:00.009
You put me
in that position again,

38:00.093 --> 38:02.511
and I'll do
whatever I have to do to win.

38:02.596 --> 38:04.930
Because we win.

38:04.998 --> 38:07.683
Are you saying screw
this deal, let's kick his ass?

38:07.768 --> 38:08.768
No.

38:08.835 --> 38:10.853
I'm saying take the deal.

38:10.937 --> 38:13.672
We already did.

38:23.150 --> 38:24.784
Sorry.

38:24.851 --> 38:26.518
Me too.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.020
You were just trying
to help me.

38:28.071 --> 38:29.238
Yeah, but I shouldn't
have said something

38:29.323 --> 38:31.824
I knew would hurt you
just to end an argument.

38:31.875 --> 38:34.493
I don't want
to keep secrets from you.

38:34.544 --> 38:37.529
You don't have to.

38:37.581 --> 38:40.216
So Louis asked me.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.251
And what did you say?

38:42.336 --> 38:44.670
I told him I needed
some time to think about it,

38:44.721 --> 38:47.556
and then
I came straight here.

38:47.641 --> 38:49.759
So you're really
just apologizing

38:49.843 --> 38:51.677
because you need
my advice.

38:51.728 --> 38:52.728
Well, I also want sex.

38:52.813 --> 38:54.096
You can have one
or the other.

38:54.181 --> 38:55.181
I really don't need
any advice.

39:07.727 --> 39:10.579
It's a good deal, Ava.
Don't second-guess yourself.

39:10.664 --> 39:14.233
I'm not in the habit
of second-guessing myself.

39:14.284 --> 39:16.252
No, I just realized
when I get back to London,

39:16.336 --> 39:18.587
my right hand
is going to be gone.

39:18.672 --> 39:19.955
Your right hand
sold you out.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.006
You made it
seem like he did it

39:21.074 --> 39:22.208
for his own personal gain,

39:22.259 --> 39:24.844
but he did it
for his own survival.

39:24.911 --> 39:26.045
He still did it.

39:26.096 --> 39:27.079
But that doesn't mean

39:27.130 --> 39:30.099
I'm not going to miss him.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.471
Good-bye, Harvey.

39:35.555 --> 39:37.256
Goodbye, Ava.

39:42.979 --> 39:44.697
Do you want me
to send a copy to Darby?

39:44.764 --> 39:46.565
I do.

39:46.616 --> 39:47.933
I thought maybe
working with Jessica

39:47.984 --> 39:49.452
would change your mind
about taking over the firm.

39:49.536 --> 39:51.954
- It didn't.
- Why not?

39:52.038 --> 39:53.489
Because if she had it
to do all over again,

39:53.573 --> 39:55.941
she would.

39:57.911 --> 39:58.828
Harvey,
if this whole thing

39:58.912 --> 40:01.113
is really Jessica's fault,

40:01.164 --> 40:04.450
maybe it's time
we considered forgiving Mike.

40:10.507 --> 40:12.391
If she's not vacuuming
properly, then just fire her.

40:12.459 --> 40:13.559
It doesn't matter.

40:13.626 --> 40:14.560
You'll get someone--

40:14.627 --> 40:16.645
Mom, I gotta go.
Bye.

40:20.684 --> 40:22.468
You make me want
to be a better man.

40:22.519 --> 40:25.154
- You watched it?
- Loved it.

40:25.238 --> 40:28.324
Well, you had me
at hello.

40:28.408 --> 40:30.910
You watched
<i>Jerry Maguire?</i>

40:30.977 --> 40:32.695
Jerry, did you know
the human head weighs 8 pounds?

40:32.779 --> 40:34.413
These are the A.B.C.s
of me, baby!

40:34.481 --> 40:37.149
Show me the money!

40:39.419 --> 40:40.786
Ahh.

40:40.837 --> 40:42.621
You know, normally, I wouldn't
want to jinx anything,

40:42.672 --> 40:44.156
but I got us something.
Okay.

40:44.207 --> 40:45.491
The perfect way to consummate
our relationship.

40:45.542 --> 40:46.509
So just wait right here.
It's in the kitchen.

40:46.593 --> 40:48.511
Sure.

40:59.856 --> 41:03.192
I can't let you do this.

41:05.312 --> 41:06.512
Let me?

41:06.563 --> 41:08.864
Don't do this.

41:11.485 --> 41:15.154
I already said yes.

41:15.205 --> 41:16.789
I can't go back
on my word.

41:16.856 --> 41:19.708
You're not going back
on your word.

41:19.793 --> 41:22.127
You're going back
where you belong.

41:26.883 --> 41:28.384
I am.

41:31.221 --> 41:34.039
I am sorry.

41:34.090 --> 41:35.707
I know.

41:35.759 --> 41:39.178
Look, why don't you
take tonight off

41:39.229 --> 41:42.231
and go out
with your girlfriend?

41:51.241 --> 41:53.275
Thanks, Harvey.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.160
No, we're going up top.

41:55.228 --> 41:56.745
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

41:56.830 --> 41:59.748
But if you come in
late tomorrow, you're fired.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.367
We'll see.
