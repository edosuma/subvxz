ENEMIES.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.917

00:16.950 --> 00:18.052
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

>> I WIN HOH AND I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A SPLIT SECOND TO CELEBRATE

03:59.072 --> 04:03.411
BECAUSE JESSICA SAYS SHE HAS A
TEMPTATION, WHICH KEEPS HER AND

04:03.444 --> 04:04.845
CODY SAFE.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.581
YOU WERE ON THE BLOCK LAST WEEK.

THE 7-3 VOTE SHOWED ME IT'S
STILL CODY AND I VERSUS THE

ENTIRE HOUSE, ME TELLING
EVERYBODY THAT I HAVE THE

04:35.142 --> 04:39.513
TEMPTATION IS JUST STRONG ARMING
INTO NOMINATING TWO OTHER PEOPLE

04:39.547 --> 04:41.649
BESIDES CODY AND I SO I DON'T
HAVE TO USE IT

04:41.682 --> 04:44.318

GOING TO PUT YOU AND CODY UP

ACCOMPLISH.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.071

AFRAID OF HER THAN EVER BEFORE.

PLAN IN PLACE TO KEEP JOSH IN

THIS HOUSE THAT I WAS ABSOLUTELY
EXCLUDED FROM.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.796

HOW DOES IT FEEL
>> MARK HAS MADE MY TIME IN THIS

05:46.947 --> 05:48.048
HOUSE MISERABLE.

05:48.081 --> 05:52.019
NOT ONLY DID HE THROW PICKLE
JUICE AT MY FACE BUT HE'S

05:52.052 --> 05:55.022
RUNNING HIS MOUTH CAMPAIGNING TO
GET ME OUT.

05:55.055 --> 05:59.927
I WANT TO GET IN HIS MEATBALL
HEAD AND TELL HIM HE'S OFF HIS

05:59.960 --> 06:00.928

07:47.935 --> 07:54.141
ANOTHER WEEK AND I'M NAUSEOUS
ABOUT IT.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.678

ME TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH

07:57.711 --> 08:00.881
HIM TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE
TEMPTATION

08:00.914 --> 08:07.555

08:15.629 --> 08:18.966
AND NOT NOMINATE AND EVICT
SOMEBODY

08:18.999 --> 08:22.603
>> HOPEFULLY I'LL STRONG ARM
PAUL AND FORCE HIM TO NOMINATE

08:22.636 --> 08:26.674
TWO OTHERS AND I CAN USE THE HEX
NEXT WEEK IF NEED BE.

08:26.707 --> 08:34.481
>> NO, I DON'T.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.686
>> SHE SAID THAT THING ABOUT THE
TEMPTATION AND I NEED TO LEAVE.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.354

08:41.388 --> 08:44.625
>> AFTER JUST REVEAL IT?

08:44.658 --> 08:45.425
>> YES.

08:45.458 --> 08:57.237
THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE
IT.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.138
EXACTLY.

08:58.171 --> 09:05.713
>> I'M KIND OF -- THEY DIDN'T
COORDINATE.

09:07.314 --> 09:15.488
>> I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOOD.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.324
I'VE BECOME AN OUTSIDER.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.828
>> WHEN YOU'RE SO SURE THE VOTE
WILL GO A CERTAIN WAY AND THEN

09:20.861 --> 09:25.633
GOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE WAY, YOU
FEEL LIKE AN OUTSIDER.

09:25.666 --> 09:34.808
I'M SCARED FOR MY LONG EVITY IN
THIS HOUSE.

09:34.842 --> 09:38.311
>> HE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.

09:38.345 --> 09:51.124
ARE YOU GOING TO STAY AWAY FROM
ME TOO?

09:51.158 --> 09:58.565
>> KIND OF I WAS KEPT IN THE
DARK ABOUT IT.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.803
>> THAT WAS NOT A PERSONAL SHOT
AT YOU.

10:02.836 --> 10:07.240
EVERY TIME I EVER WENT IN YOUR
ROOM WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE

10:07.274 --> 10:09.309
TRIED TO RECONNECT.

10:09.342 --> 10:13.647
>> GUYS, I DID BLIND SIDE YOU
WITH MY VOTE BUT AT THE SAME

10:13.681 --> 10:17.617
TIME, I DON'T TRUST ANYWAY, SO
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR

10:17.651 --> 10:21.689
MY GAME AND THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY
VOTING RAMSES IS OUT.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.956

10:25.693 --> 10:26.559
I DON'T TRUST MATT.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.895
I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH MATT.

10:27.928 --> 10:32.265
HE BETRAYED ME IN THE BEGINNING
AND THERE IS NO COMING BACK FROM

10:32.299 --> 10:37.671
THAT
THAT.

10:37.705 --> 10:43.010
>> I'M GOING TO PUT CODY UP THIS
EVENING BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S

10:43.043 --> 10:43.643
BLUFFING.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.478
I'M GOING TO CALL THE BLUFF.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.581
NEXT WEEK, KEEP ME IN.

10:48.615 --> 10:53.253
I'M MAKING BIG BOLD MOVES THIS
WEEK.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.689
>> FROM HERE ON.

10:55.723 --> 11:00.460
WE NEED TO GET THE BALL ROLLING
>> WE DON'T BELIEVE JESSICA HAS

11:00.493 --> 11:05.265
THIS POWER THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE
SURE SHE DOESN'T IS TO PUT

11:05.298 --> 11:11.271
JESSICA AND CODY ON THE BLOCK
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.440

11:13.473 --> 11:15.475
MY BACK, FRONT, SIDE, UPSIDEDOWN
NEXT WEEK.

11:29.957 --> 11:33.260
>>> JESSICA AND I WERE
BLINDSIDED BECAUSE OF THE VOTE,

11:33.293 --> 11:36.196
MARK IS THE CLOSEST THING THAT I
CAN TRUST OUTSIDE OF JESSICA IN

11:36.229 --> 11:40.067
THIS GAME, I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT MARK IS ON PAUL'S RADAR.

11:40.100 --> 11:44.704
>> WHEN WE WERE REESTABLISHING
OUR TRUST OR LOYALTY IN THIS

11:44.738 --> 11:49.442
GAME, I SAY MARK IS GOING TO
REESTABLISH THINGS.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.612
I SAID WHAT ARE YOUR INTERESTS
IN THE HOUSE?

11:52.645 --> 11:59.286
AND MARK SAID ME, ELENA AND
PAUL.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.521
AND I SAID I DIG THAT.

12:01.554 --> 12:05.325
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, HE'S BEEN
RIGHT THERE FOR YOU.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.160
>> THAT'S ALL I GOT.

12:07.194 --> 12:11.398
>> BUT WHAT I WANTED TO MAKE
SURE WAS IN REESTABLISHING MY

12:11.431 --> 12:16.069
RELATIONSHIP WITH MARK, I WANTED
TO KNOW WHAT HIS INTERESTS WERE.

12:16.103 --> 12:21.574
WHATEVER HAPPENS THIS WEEK, JUST
LET ME DO MY WORK.

12:21.608 --> 12:21.875
DEAL?

12:21.909 --> 12:22.309
>> DEAL.

12:22.342 --> 12:27.948
>> CHOW, BUDDY.

12:27.981 --> 12:32.019
>> CODY FEELS THE NEED TO TELL
ME I'M BATTING FOR MARK.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.520
SOMETHING, SOMETHING.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.254
MARK.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.189
WELL, THANKS A LOT.

12:36.223 --> 12:40.293
CODY BECAUSE IF I CAN'T GET YOU
OR JESS, I'M GOING TO GET YOUR

12:40.327 --> 12:47.935
ONLY CONNECTION, MARK.

12:47.968 --> 12:48.601
* .

12:48.635 --> 12:52.272
* .

12:52.305 --> 12:53.706
>> YOU.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.909
>> WHAT UP?
>> WHAT UP?

12:55.943 --> 13:01.548
>> SO ALEX AND I HAVE ACTUALLY
BEEN A PART OF A LITTLE SECRET

13:01.581 --> 13:02.749
FOR AWHILE.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.152
I WANT TO COMBINE HEADS AND
CONFIDENTLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

13:05.185 --> 13:06.619
BACKUP PLANS ARE THIS WEEK.

13:06.653 --> 13:11.424
>> THEY HAVE NOT A SMALL INKLING
THAT YOU AND I HAVE ANY SORT OF

13:11.458 --> 13:12.926
BOND.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.927
WE'RE KILLING IT.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.865
LET ME GIVE YOU MY PLAN, I'VE
THOUGHT THIS OUT.

13:17.898 --> 13:21.034
I THINK CODY JUST WALKED IN.

13:21.068 --> 13:24.137
LET'S SAY THEY'RE TELLING THE
TRUTH AND THEY'RE BOTH SAFE.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.706
I'M GOING TO PUT THEM UP AND
FIND OUT.

13:26.739 --> 13:30.277
IF IT IS TRUE THEY PULL
THEMSELVES DOWN AND MARK AND

13:30.310 --> 13:31.378
ELENA GO UP.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.848
ELENA WITH POWER TO MAKE
RATIONAL DECISIONS.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.784
DANGEROUS, BUT SHE WOULDN'T GO
AGAINST EIGHT.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.487
SHE WANTS TO PLAY A SAFE GAME.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.357
BUT MARK WANTS TO MAKE SURE.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.860
>> I'M NOT SURE IF JESSICA DOES
HAVE

13:46.894 --> 13:48.128
CODY SAFE OR NOT.

13:48.161 --> 13:53.266
BUT IF THE OFF CHANCE SHE DOES,
I BELIEVE IF JESS AND CODY GET

13:53.300 --> 13:55.268
NOMINATED, THEY HAVE TO USE IT
AND PULL THEMSELVES OFF THE

13:55.302 --> 13:58.771
BLOCK, IF THAT HAPPENS I HAVE TO
PUT UP TWO REPLACEMENTS AND I'VE

13:58.805 --> 14:02.475
GOT THAT FIGURED OUT
>> MARK GOES UP.

14:02.509 --> 14:08.148
DONE
DONE.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.017
>> WHAT'S UP?
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL

14:10.050 --> 14:11.584
>> NOT GREAT.

14:11.618 --> 14:15.889
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT ANYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED.

14:15.923 --> 14:19.592
>> BECAUSE MARK IS MY BACKUP
TARGET, I NEED TO MAKE A

14:19.626 --> 14:22.862
CONNECTION WITH ELENA AND MAKE
HER UNDERSTAND THAT MARK IS

14:22.896 --> 14:27.434
REALLY RUINING HER GAME, IF I
CAN PLANT SEEDS WHERE SHE COULD

14:27.467 --> 14:28.701
SEPARATE.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.172
THAT WOULD LEAVE MARK AS A LONE
WOLF STRANDED AND A PRETTY BIG

14:32.205 --> 14:34.207
TARGET
>> BE CAREFUL DUDE OF WHO YOU'RE

14:34.241 --> 14:35.976
SURROUNDING YOURSELF WITH.

14:36.009 --> 14:40.347
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO UNDAMAGE
MYSELF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH

14:40.380 --> 14:41.581
MARK.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.684
>> HE HAS CLEARLY ATTACHED BACK
TO CODY AND CODY CAME UP HERE

14:44.717 --> 14:46.954
AND BATTED FOR HIM.

14:46.987 --> 14:51.791
I GENUINELY THINK THAT YOU AND I
ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL OF

14:51.824 --> 14:52.325
OPERATION.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.560
>> I THINK WE ARE TOO.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.595
>> WHICH IS WHY I'M TRYING TO
TAKE YOU LIKE THIS AND HIT YOU

14:55.628 --> 14:58.631
>> I CAN'T LIKE HEY, LEAVE ME
ALONE FOR THE REST OF THE GAME

14:58.665 --> 15:01.768
>> I'M TELLING YOU THE DAMAGE IS
DONE.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.537
THIS IS YOUR POINT TO PIVOT IN
THIS GAME

15:04.571 --> 15:09.842
>> OBVIOUSLY, I ENJOY MARK, BUT
I REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

15:09.876 --> 15:10.978
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

15:11.011 --> 15:17.450
I CANNOT LEAVE THIS GAME BECAUSE
OF MY SHOW MANCE.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.020
I CANNOT LOOK THAT DUMB
>> IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO

15:20.053 --> 15:21.154
DRAG YOU DOWN.

15:21.188 --> 15:28.661
I HAVE THE POWER OF REINVITING
YOU INTO A BIGGER PLAN.

15:28.695 --> 15:28.962
YOU.

15:28.996 --> 15:42.809
NOT HER.

15:42.842 --> 15:47.580
>> CODY AND JESS WANT TO WORK
WITH US.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.815
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR OBSESSION
WITH HIM IS

15:48.848 --> 15:52.319
>> CODY IS THE ONLY PERSON IN
THIS HOUSE THAT I CAN BE MYSELF

15:52.352 --> 15:54.787
AROUND
>> DON'T FORGET IT'S A GAME.

15:54.821 --> 15:58.491
>> IT'S HARD TO TRUST PEOPLE
>> SOMETIMES IT'S LESS IMPORTANT

15:58.525 --> 16:01.628
WHO YOU CAN BE YOURSELF AROUND
AND MORE IMPORTANT HOW LONG YOU

16:01.661 --> 16:08.135
CAN STAY IN THE HOUSE.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.969
YOU'RE SAYING TRUST SOMEBODY
ELSE

16:10.003 --> 16:12.605
>> WHY ARE YOU NOT SPEAKING TO
ME?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.707
>> HAVE I EVER?

16:14.741 --> 16:15.908
>> I DON'T KNOW.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.611
>> LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ANNOYED
ABOUT SOMETHING BUT YOU DON'T

16:18.645 --> 16:19.879
SAY IT.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.982
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE I'M
SPENDING TIME WITH CODY IF YOU

16:23.016 --> 16:27.220
THINK IT MAKES IT LOOK BAD FOR
ME WHICH MAKES IT LOOK BAD FOR

16:27.254 --> 16:28.455
YOU.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.790
>> I DO THINK YOU SPEND MORE
TIME WITH CODY THAN YOU SHOULD

16:30.823 --> 16:32.859
BUT I'M NOT YOUR KEEPER, SO I'M
NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT TO

16:32.892 --> 16:34.127
DO.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.397
THE ONLY THING THAT SUCKS ABOUT
THAT IS I'M ASSOCIATED WITH YOU.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.731
I LOVE JESSICA.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.733
I LOVE CODY.

16:40.767 --> 16:45.372
BUT THE THINGS THEY'VE DONE IN
THIS GAME PROBABLY LEFT A BAD

16:45.405 --> 16:49.476
TASTE IN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S
HOUSE, NOW EASE BACK IN THE

16:49.509 --> 16:54.147
HOUSE AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE
ALIGNING TOGETHER AND BEST

16:54.181 --> 16:58.285
FRIEND AND YOU AND I TO BE
ALIGNING AND BE AFFILIATES.

16:58.318 --> 17:03.556
TAKE ONE THING AND THEN GO ON IT
>> I DID NOT LEAVE MY LIFE TO

17:03.590 --> 17:08.361
THROW MY ENTIRE BIG BROTHER GAME
AWAY FOR A GUY THAT I MET UNDER

17:08.395 --> 17:11.398
40 DAYS AGO.

17:11.431 --> 17:18.705
>> THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME YOUR
THOUGHTS.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.674
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO SHUT THIS?

17:21.708 --> 17:22.775
>> I DON'T CARE.

17:22.809 --> 17:23.443
>> WHAT?

17:23.476 --> 17:25.478
>> I DON'T CARE.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.930
*
>> MR. CLERK: MY GOSH.

17:43.963 --> 17:49.869
>>> HOUSEGUESTS, THE FINAL
TEMPTATION WAS ACCEPTED AND IT

17:49.902 --> 17:56.042
IS TIME TO LEARN WHAT
CONSEQUENCE AWAITS.

17:56.075 --> 18:00.046
HA HA.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.915
>> BECAUSE THE FILE TEMPTATION
INSIDE THE DEN WAS ACCEPTED.

18:02.949 --> 18:07.254
A NEW TWIST HAS BEEN UNLEASHED
ON THE HOUSE THE NEXT THREE

18:07.287 --> 18:09.789
WEEK, IT SOLVED THE TEMPTATION
COMPETITION.

18:09.822 --> 18:13.092
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BIG
BROTHER HISTORY, IT IS UP TO YOU

18:13.126 --> 18:15.595
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU
COMPETE.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.664
WHY BE TEMPTED TO COMPETE?

18:17.697 --> 18:20.500
BECAUSE THE WINNER WILL EARN
SAFETY FOR THE WEEK.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.701
WARNED.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.238
IF YOU DECIDE TO COMPETE AND
COME IN LAST PLACE, YOU WILL

18:25.272 --> 18:30.042
AUTOMATICALLY BECOME A SPECIAL
THIRD NOMINEE FOR THE WEEK.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.712
THIRD NOMINEE WILL BE PLAYING IN
THE VETO COMPETITION AND IF THIS

18:32.745 --> 18:36.516
PERSON IS SAFE WITH THE VETO,
THERE WILL BE NO REPLACEMENT.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.085
IF ONLY ONE PERSON CHOOSES TO
PLAY IN THIS COMPETITION, THAT

18:39.118 --> 18:41.854
PERSON WILL EARN SAFETY FOR THE
WEEK.

18:41.888 --> 18:45.225
SINCE THE HOH CANNOT BE
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION, THEY'RE

18:45.258 --> 18:46.426
NOT ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.428
WHO WILL BE TEMPTED TO PLAY IN
THE TEMPTATION COMPETITION?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.929
TAKE SOME TIME TO THINK IT OVER.

18:49.962 --> 18:54.667
WHEN YOU ARE CALLED INTO THE DEN
OF TEMPTATION, YOU MUST LOCK IN

18:54.701 --> 18:55.768
YOUR DECISION.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.805
>> THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF
TEMPTATION.

18:58.838 --> 19:02.975
A VERY HIGH REWARD AND A HIGH
RISK.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.178
THIS WAS THE TEMPTATION IN THE
HOUSE IS HUGE.

19:05.212 --> 19:09.216
I GOT TWO CHANCES TO SAVE
MYSELF, BUT IF I LOSE, I'M STILL

19:09.249 --> 19:10.350
GOING TO BE THE THIRD
NOMINATION.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.520
SO IT'S KIND OF A TOSS-UP, A
50-50.

19:13.553 --> 19:18.157
>> THIS TEMPTATION IS A GAME
CHANGER, IT LITERALLY CAN

19:18.191 --> 19:20.727
MANIPULATE THE WAY THE
NOMINATIONS GO, THIS NEW

19:20.760 --> 19:24.030
TEMPTATION COULD TOTALLY SCREW
THINGS UP FOR US.

19:24.063 --> 19:28.568
>> I LOVE IT.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.771
>> MIGHT AS WELL COMPETE IN THIS
THING.

19:31.804 --> 19:38.044
>> I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE
WHAT A POKER FACE IS.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.447
>> I DON'T WANT CODY TO COMPETE
BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE

19:40.480 --> 19:43.783
THAT WE FELT COMFORTABLE AND
SAFE AND WE TRUST THEM.

19:43.816 --> 19:47.587
IF CODY COMPETES PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO THINK WE'RE WORRIED.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.523
>> GIVE THE PEOPLE ALL THE
INFORMATION.

19:50.557 --> 20:01.200
>> FINE, I'LL
>> WE'LL LINE UP.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.769
>> NO?

20:02.802 --> 20:06.339
>> I'M THINKING THAT BY NOT
COMPETING IN THIS TEMPTATION

20:06.373 --> 20:10.076
COMPETITION, IT WILL SHOW PAUL
THAT I DO STILL TRUST HIM AND

20:10.109 --> 20:14.881
WHATEVER GAME MOVES HE'S MAKING
AS HOH.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.284
>> HOW ARE YOU ALL DOING?

20:17.317 --> 20:20.553
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

20:20.587 --> 20:22.989
>> I WANT TO COMPETE
>> I REALLY WANT TO COMPETE AND

20:23.022 --> 20:26.293
GUARANTEE MY SAFETY BUT ON THE
OTHER HAND, IF I COME IN LAST

20:26.326 --> 20:30.263
PLACE, I'M UP ON THE BLOCK AND I
HAVE A TARGET ON MY BACK.

20:30.297 --> 20:36.703
>> I CAN'T POSSIBLY DO ANY
WORSE.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.938
ODDS ARE PROBABLY PRETTY GOOD.

20:38.971 --> 20:46.846
>> TO NOT BE LAST
>> HA HA.

20:46.879 --> 20:51.017
>> I THINK I'M GOING TO COMPETE
>> YOU WANT TO LAY LOW FOR A

20:51.050 --> 20:54.020
LITTLE BIT.

20:54.053 --> 20:54.754
MIGHT DO IT.

20:54.787 --> 21:00.092
MIGHT NOT.

21:00.126 --> 21:04.597
>> I THINK YOU MIGHT AS WELL
PLAY, DUDE.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.433
IT'S A TOUGH UP NUMBER.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.969
BECAUSE I THINK MARK AND ELENA
ARE GOING TO PLAY.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.104
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO
COME IN LAST.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.375
>> I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
>> THERE IS NOT A LOT OF UP SIDE

21:15.408 --> 21:17.910
FOR ME PERSONALLY TO PLAY IN
THIS TEMPTATION CHALLENGE.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.178
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:19.211 --> 21:23.015
PAUL, I'M A TEAM PLAYER, YOU
WANT ME TO GO AHEAD AND COMPETE

21:23.049 --> 21:29.822
I'LL DO IT.

21:29.856 --> 21:33.893
>> ALEX, YOU MAY NOW ENTER.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.994
>> YES.

21:35.027 --> 21:45.071
>> THE DEN
>> HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.

21:45.071 --> 21:52.679
>> THE DEN
>> HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.

21:52.712 --> 21:57.384
>> THIS IS COOL
>> ALEX ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH TO

21:57.417 --> 22:01.253
COMPETE IN THE TEMPTATION
COMPETITION?

22:01.287 --> 22:11.564
IF YOU WISH TO PARTICIPATE,
DRINK THE GREEN POTION, IF YOU

22:11.598 --> 22:16.636
DON'T DRINK THE RED ONE, CHOOSE
WISELY BECAUSE THE POTION YOU

22:16.669 --> 22:18.438
DRINK WILL OFFICIALLY LOCK IN
YOUR DECISION.

22:18.471 --> 22:25.077
HA HA HA HA HA HA
>> I'M TRYING TO DECIDE IF I

22:25.111 --> 22:26.446
WANT TO PLAY OR NOT.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.014
IF I PLAY AND WIN I'M GUARANTEED
SAFETY.

22:28.047 --> 22:32.552
IF I PLAY AND LOSE, I END UP AS
THE THIRD NOMINEE ON THE BLOCK.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.822
I WANT TO BE A TEAM PLAYER BUT I
HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR

22:35.855 --> 22:36.489
MY GAME.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.624
HERE GOES NOTHING.

22:37.657 --> 22:40.427
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE
DETAILS TO MY TEMPTATION.

22:40.460 --> 22:45.798
>> TELL ME THERE'S MOUNTAIN DO
INSIDE THIS BABY.

22:45.832 --> 22:53.272
>> THAT TO TASTED JUST LIKE NOT
COMPETING, AWFUL.

22:53.305 --> 23:00.980
>> WHY?
>> DELICIOUS.

23:01.013 --> 23:04.283
>> I KNOW THERE'S A CHANCE PAUL
IS GOING TO USE ME AS A PAWN

23:04.316 --> 23:08.955
THIS WEEK, THIS COMPETITION
COULD BE MY TICKET TO SAFETY.

23:08.988 --> 23:12.725
OR COULD ALSO SHOW PAUL THAT I
DON'T TRUST HIM.

23:12.759 --> 23:16.429
IT COULD BE MY GUARANTEED
EVICTION.

23:16.463 --> 23:20.800
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO
DO

23:20.833 --> 23:21.934
DO.

23:21.968 --> 23:25.371
>> I DON'T AGREE WITH JESSICA
NOT WANTING ME TO COMPETE.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.175
WHEN A COMPETITION OPPORTUNITY
ARISES, I HAVE TO TAKE IT.

23:29.208 --> 23:37.016
I DIDN'T COME INTO THIS GAME TO
BE A DUD.

23:37.049 --> 23:44.857
(THUNDE
(THUNDER).

23:44.891 --> 23:50.196
>>> WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR NAME,
STAND AND PREPARE TO COMPETE.

23:50.229 --> 23:50.963
>> WOW.

23:50.997 --> 23:56.435
>> I JUST PEED A LITTLE
>> JASON.

23:56.469 --> 24:01.107
>>> MAX.

24:01.140 --> 24:05.845
>>> ALEX.

24:05.878 --> 24:11.518
>>> MARK.

24:11.551 --> 24:12.785
.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.955
>> I HAD MY PLAN A AND B PRETTY
SOFT THIS WEEK, CODY AND JESSICA

24:15.988 --> 24:19.091
ARE PLAN A, MARK AND ELENA PLAN
B.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.094
UNFORTUNATELY MARK THOUGHT IT
WAS A GOOD IDEA TO COMPETE IN

24:22.128 --> 24:27.166
THIS TEMPTATION, NO MATTER WHAT
I CAN'T HAVE MARK WIN OR I'LL

24:27.199 --> 24:32.238
HAVE TO PIVOT ONE OF MY PLANS.

24:32.271 --> 24:41.113
WHAT KIND OF HELL COULD WE
POSSIBLY BE IN FOR?

24:41.147 --> 24:41.781
WHOA.

24:41.814 --> 24:47.053
>> THIS IS SO -- IT'S AWESOME.

24:47.086 --> 24:52.291
>> I SEE A HANDLE ACT BOWLING
LEAGUE, THIS WEEK IS BIG BROTHER

>> BUT WHERE IS MY TWO TWO
>> YOU CAN'T FIGHT FOR YOUR

24:59.599 --> 25:02.301
LIVES WITHOUT THE PROPER ATTIRE.

25:02.334 --> 25:08.841
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.

25:08.875 --> 25:09.642
>> YES.

25:09.676 --> 25:13.613
>> MY GOSH.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.280
I CAN'T.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.447
>> I WAS LEFT OUT OF THE BOWL.

25:15.481 --> 25:20.452
I FEEL LIKE AN OUTSIDER, THIS IS
WHAT MY LIFE HAS COME TO,

25:20.486 --> 25:24.857
WEARING A TUTU, IN THE BIG
BROTHER HOUSE FIGHTING FOR MY

25:24.891 --> 25:25.725
LIFE.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.960
IT'S TIME TO DANCE LIKE NEVER
BEFORE

25:27.994 --> 25:29.829
>> WELCOME TO THE FIRST EVER BIG
BROTHER TEMPTATION COMPETITION,

25:29.862 --> 25:32.531
FOUR OF YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE
TEMPTATION TO PLAY IN TODAY'S

25:32.565 --> 25:34.701
COMPETITION, WITH ALL THE TWISTS
SO FAR THIS SEASON, YOU SHOULD

25:34.734 --> 25:40.039
BE WELL PREPARED TO SPIN YOUR
WAY THROUGH A GAME OF BOWL

25:40.072 --> 25:40.840
ARENA.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.308
PRESS THE BUTTON TO START THE
CLOCK.

25:42.341 --> 25:45.544
THE GOAL IS TO KNOCK DOWN YOUR
FOUR BOWLING PINS IN THE FASTEST

25:45.578 --> 25:46.445
TIME.

25:46.478 --> 25:51.450
BUT A GATE IS BLOCKING YOUR
LANE.

25:51.483 --> 25:54.887
LOWER YOUR GATE, PULL THE HANDLE
AND PULL 15 TIMES, IT WILL LOWER

25:54.921 --> 25:55.788
15 SECONDS.

25:55.822 --> 25:59.425
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PULL DOWN
YOUR PIN.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.528
YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE FAST BECAUSE
AFTER 15 SECONDS, THE GATE WILL

26:02.561 --> 26:09.769
POP BACK UP AND YOU'LL HAVE TO
SPIN AGAIN TO GET MORE BOWLING

26:09.802 --> 26:11.003
TIME.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.906
THE PLAYER KNOCKS DOWN ALL THE

26:13.940 --> 26:15.041
WEEK.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.208
REMEMBER, THERE'S MORE THAN
SAFETY AT STAKE BECAUSE THE

PLAYER THAT FINISHES IN LAST
PLACE WILL BE PLACED ON THE

26:19.746 --> 26:22.915

26:22.949 --> 26:28.420
WHO'S READY TO PLAY BOWL ARENA?

26:28.454 --> 26:33.059

THING, I RIDE BULLS, I JUMP OFF

26:39.365 --> 26:40.032
HORSES.

ONLY MAN GOING TO WIN THIS CAMP?

26:42.001 --> 26:45.071
FIRST NAME WHISTLE, LAST NAME
NUTS.

26:45.104 --> 26:53.680
I MIGHT SCREW THIS ON DAMN
