00:02.794 --> 00:05.129
The reason I asked you to brunch...

00:05.296 --> 00:08.549
...is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.759
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

00:11.636 --> 00:12.845
I hope it's you.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.888
- I hope it's you.
- Me too.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.851
First of all, I love you both so much.

00:19.019 --> 00:23.063
- You're both so important to me.
- Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

00:24.149 --> 00:26.734
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...

00:26.943 --> 00:29.111
...where we trade off being maid of honor.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.613
- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
- Yes! Oh.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.743
Hypothetically.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.077
Still.

00:38.538 --> 00:42.416
If Phoebe were mine,
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.252
We all get to do it and no one gets upset.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.757
- That's a pretty good idea.
- I'll do that. So who's yours?

00:50.967 --> 00:54.678
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.850
- Why is that the best part?
- I don't have to.

01:01.311 --> 01:06.356
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.025
I'd like to make a toast.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.320
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...

01:12.155 --> 01:15.532
...my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that...

01:16.701 --> 01:18.368
- Really not deciding.
- Fine.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.915
Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.584
- You're marrying Chandler Bing?
- Yeah.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.877
Huh.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.170
Good luck!

01:29.756 --> 01:32.299
Oh, and good luck to you too!

01:32.759 --> 01:34.676
What a nice lady.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.511
Yeah!

02:17.804 --> 02:21.098
- Die Hard, still great.
- Yep.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.142
Let's make it a double feature?

02:23.351 --> 02:24.601
What else did you rent?

02:25.186 --> 02:27.187
Die Hard 2.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.107
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

02:31.526 --> 02:35.571
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.408
- Joey, we just saw it.
- And?

02:39.617 --> 02:41.702
It would be cool to see it again!

02:41.870 --> 02:44.705
- Yeah! Die Hard!
- Die Hard!

02:46.374 --> 02:48.375
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.878
Is everything okay?

02:51.504 --> 02:53.839
Yeah, I just got plans.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.342
Well, John McClane had plans.

02:58.052 --> 03:01.305
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...

03:01.556 --> 03:03.891
...and starts calling everybody "bitch."

03:05.310 --> 03:08.020
What are you talking about, bitch?

03:11.065 --> 03:12.608
- Hey, Rachel.
- Yeah?

03:12.817 --> 03:16.403
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

03:16.571 --> 03:17.988
Really?

03:18.489 --> 03:21.533
Oh, my God, Phoebe. I mean, I'm just...

03:21.784 --> 03:23.202
Wait a minute.

03:26.164 --> 03:30.167
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.127
Oh.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.547
- Well, if that's what you want.
- Oh!

03:36.507 --> 03:39.176
No way, Phoebe. I want to be Monica's.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.679
- Why does it even matter?
- Why does it matter to you?

03:42.847 --> 03:45.307
Because this one is now.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.060
And it's two of our best friends.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.187
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.193
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

03:57.570 --> 03:59.363
You wouldn't.

04:00.865 --> 04:04.910
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...

04:05.119 --> 04:08.455
...but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.874
I know you've done it at least twice.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.086
- Yeah, but, Phoebe...
- Please let me finish.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.214
I guess that was it.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.591
Okay.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.846
Okay. Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.057
Oh, thank you so much!

04:28.685 --> 04:30.352
Yay.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.064
I'm gonna marry someone good.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.733
Oh, I know.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.319
- Better than Chandler.
- Pfft.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.466
- What happened?
- I don't know.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.594
We fell asleep. That is all.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.639
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.976
All right, well, I'd better go.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.103
- I think that would be best.
- Yeah.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.022
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

05:15.189 --> 05:18.650
- But not about this.
- No, never. Never!

05:19.610 --> 05:21.278
- So, uh...
- Uh...

05:22.155 --> 05:24.364
- Bye.
- No touch. No touch.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.454
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.956
This woman overheard
that I was marrying you...

05:33.124 --> 05:35.334
...and she wished me good luck.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.793
That's sweet.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.963
No, it was more like a "good luck."

05:41.341 --> 05:43.633
So, what did this woman look like?

05:43.801 --> 05:46.136
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.

05:46.304 --> 05:50.891
Any chance you were looking into
a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

05:51.392 --> 05:53.602
Was it someone you dated in college?

05:53.770 --> 05:56.104
No, I only dated two girls in college...

05:56.272 --> 05:59.775
...both blond, both not attractive.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.277
Let me check this out.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.113
- What are you doing?
- Well, let's see.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.200
Okay, uh, is that her?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.826
Oh, my God, yes!

06:09.994 --> 06:14.039
- Who is she?
- Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.832
Did you break up with her?

06:17.126 --> 06:19.336
No, we're still together.

06:23.424 --> 06:26.843
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.012
- Why?
- She came back the third summer...

06:29.180 --> 06:32.724
...and she'd gotten really fa... Ahh.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.563
- Fat?
- I did not say fat.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.108
I said fa... Ahh.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.487
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.447
Yeah. Yeah.

06:47.615 --> 06:51.993
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

06:52.161 --> 06:53.537
Apparently she does.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.998
You know what they say,
"Elephants never forget."

07:00.837 --> 07:03.338
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.927
Hey, what's going on?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.096
Phoebe is gonna be
Monica's maid of honor.

07:11.264 --> 07:15.851
Hey. Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

07:17.895 --> 07:20.564
You have been maid of honor before?

07:20.731 --> 07:24.651
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.446
That's it. I am maid of honor.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.781
- No, I am.
- How come you are?

07:29.949 --> 07:32.576
Because I cared enough to lie.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.704
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.622
We could have an audition.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.709
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.086
- What are you talking about?
- When I want a job...

07:43.254 --> 07:46.298
...I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see...

07:46.466 --> 07:48.091
...they give me the part.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.719
Okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

07:50.887 --> 07:53.138
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.224
- It's better than us deciding.
- Oh, this is crazy.

07:56.392 --> 08:00.395
- Can't we just flip a coin?
- No, coins hate me.

08:00.897 --> 08:05.192
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.110
Hi!

08:07.278 --> 08:09.529
Ross, sweetie.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.659
Hey there, handsome thing.

08:18.122 --> 08:22.918
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.133
Hey.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.428
Just brought back your videos.

08:33.596 --> 08:37.557
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.976
No. No, we don't.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.144
Yes, we do.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.940
Now, look. That was the best nap I ever had.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.531
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.741
Come on, admit it.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.952
That was the best nap you ever had.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.871
I've had better.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.625
Okay. When?

09:04.919 --> 09:07.963
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

09:08.130 --> 09:09.673
- Ah!
- I said it, okay?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.925
But it's over, Joey!

09:13.844 --> 09:15.387
I want to do it again.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.476
We can't do it again.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.354
- Why not?
- Because it's weird!

09:25.690 --> 09:27.315
Fine.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.442
You want a drink?

09:29.610 --> 09:33.196
- Sure. What do you got?
- Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.038
Chandler.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.916
I just figured out who you are.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.586
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

09:48.546 --> 09:51.423
- You're Louis Posen.
- Who?

09:52.258 --> 09:55.051
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.471
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.973
Do you know why?

10:00.141 --> 10:04.352
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

10:04.854 --> 10:08.106
No, but because he thought
I was too fa... Ahh.

10:09.942 --> 10:13.403
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.364
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.618
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 16 years ago.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.996
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.250
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.462
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.882
This is how it's gonna work.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.635
We'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.095
You'll be scored on a scale of one to 10.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.723
- One being the highest.
- Ten is the highest.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.517
- Why is 10 the highest?
- Because it's the highest.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.357
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.401
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

10:53.569 --> 10:57.697
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

10:57.948 --> 11:00.283
I don't want to marry Chandler.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.619
- I've got cold feet.
- It's gonna be okay.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.413
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.083
This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.671
Look, Monica...

11:12.838 --> 11:14.714
...getting cold feet is very common.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.550
It's just because of all the anticipation.

11:17.718 --> 11:21.930
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.683
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.644
You don't get to keep the gifts.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.397
Very good,
drawing on your own experience.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.940
Very good.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.484
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.944
Thank you, judges.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.113
- Kiss-ass.
- Oh.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.617
- Okay, Phoebe.
- Yes, Your Honor.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.161
We're now in the ceremony.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.414
Monica is about to say, "I do"...

11:47.581 --> 11:49.999
...when her drunk uncle starts yelling.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.584
What do you do? Go!

11:51.752 --> 11:54.421
When Monica was a little girl...

11:54.588 --> 11:55.672
...I remember that...

11:59.343 --> 12:00.760
Ow!

12:01.011 --> 12:02.512
- Very good!
- Oh.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.223
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.768
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

12:08.936 --> 12:11.771
Hey, you want a little taste of Pheebs?

12:12.565 --> 12:17.152
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.903
We haven't even prepared...

12:19.071 --> 12:22.323
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay. Um...

12:22.825 --> 12:25.118
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as...

12:25.286 --> 12:29.664
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it. Um, um...

12:29.915 --> 12:34.961
I met... I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds...

12:35.129 --> 12:40.175
...and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25...

12:40.342 --> 12:43.136
...although he seemed like a 6-year-old.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.971
Oh.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.475
Thank you. Thank you very much. Um...

12:49.727 --> 12:52.228
I've known them separately and together.

12:52.396 --> 12:58.026
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are truly in the presence of love.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.488
So I would like to raise my glass...

13:01.655 --> 13:03.281
...to Monica and Chandler...

13:03.449 --> 13:08.077
...and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

13:08.245 --> 13:11.956
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.250
Wow.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.962
- Great speech.
- Yeah, it really was.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.255
Oh, thanks.

13:19.423 --> 13:24.302
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

13:27.723 --> 13:28.890
Okay.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.562
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.273
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...

13:37.441 --> 13:40.610
...while we were showering together, naked.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.036
And she's back in the game!

13:59.755 --> 14:00.922
Julie. Hi.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.383
Chandler Bing. I guess you remember me.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.010
Hello, Skidmark.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.140
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.351
It's pretty clear.

14:15.646 --> 14:19.315
I owe you a long-overdue apology.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.986
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because you were overweight.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.738
That's why you broke up with me?

14:29.660 --> 14:31.160
You didn't know that?

14:33.080 --> 14:35.456
Well, I guess my work here is done.

14:40.087 --> 14:44.591
First of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

14:44.758 --> 14:46.843
You should be proud.

14:47.011 --> 14:51.764
And I'd also like to say,
in this competition, there are no losers.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.475
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

14:55.936 --> 14:57.604
Really? I won?

14:57.771 --> 15:00.773
- What?
- I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

15:00.941 --> 15:04.694
- Well, then I demand a recount!
- Actually, it wasn't that close.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.947
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.450
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

15:10.993 --> 15:13.411
Heads. Oh!

15:14.246 --> 15:16.831
What? The coins have finally forgiven me!

15:18.042 --> 15:21.961
You know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...

15:22.129 --> 15:26.966
...her vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

15:27.468 --> 15:32.055
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

15:34.266 --> 15:38.019
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.395
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:39.563 --> 15:44.067
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.530
Why would I care about that?

15:50.824 --> 15:53.743
No reason. I'm just saying that...

15:54.745 --> 15:56.245
...that's where I'll be.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.019
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

16:20.187 --> 16:24.524
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.318
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

16:27.486 --> 16:31.656
- Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
- I'd love it if I could do both.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.662
All right, I have to ask.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.497
What?

16:40.290 --> 16:42.709
Will you break up with me if I get fat again?

16:42.876 --> 16:44.085
What?

16:44.253 --> 16:47.588
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

16:47.756 --> 16:50.133
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.802
In one year?

16:52.970 --> 16:55.304
My God, what did she eat? Her family?

16:57.766 --> 16:59.434
That's not the point.

16:59.601 --> 17:03.604
I know it was a stupid reason
to break up with someone, but I was 15.

17:03.772 --> 17:08.067
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.530
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

17:12.698 --> 17:13.865
You called me fat.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.199
Wait a minute.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.118
- That was totally different.
- How?

17:18.287 --> 17:22.080
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.961
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.630
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

17:29.798 --> 17:33.092
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

17:37.848 --> 17:41.350
This is one of the things
that I can apologize for later.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.438
What I mean is, you're Monica.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.733
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.485
Keep going.

17:50.652 --> 17:54.864
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down...

17:55.032 --> 17:57.033
...and I will still love you.

17:58.494 --> 18:02.121
Even if I shrink down to 2 inches tall?

18:02.748 --> 18:04.916
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.460
I love you.

18:09.546 --> 18:13.758
Skidmark still got a way with the ladies.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.720
Hi, Pheebs.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.347
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.390
I just want to apologize.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.976
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.730
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.152
- Oh, you mean today.
- Yeah.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.073
Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.866
And I was thinking about it.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.411
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

18:42.579 --> 18:45.123
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:46.583 --> 18:50.128
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.506
- Just in case.
- Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.051
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.512
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.182
Here's a picture from one Halloween
when she dressed up as a bride.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.184
She made me carry her train...

19:05.352 --> 19:08.604
...which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.025
Oh, and here's a little purse that I found.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.070
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.948
- Oh.
- Something. And...

19:19.116 --> 19:23.661
...vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.497
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.876
This stuff is great.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.628
I forgot this was in here.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.551
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.763
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."

19:43.015 --> 19:44.432
And it's blue.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.811
Yeah.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.900
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.820
You do?

19:58.322 --> 20:01.866
- Why?
- Because I think it means more to you.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.827
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.038
It's fine. I mean, this is something...

20:07.206 --> 20:11.125
...that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 14?

20:11.293 --> 20:14.503
No, I was 10. I just developed early.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.131
Man alive!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.719
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey!

20:21.929 --> 20:25.139
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.808
Oh, that's great!

20:27.976 --> 20:31.270
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.648
I have really specific ideas.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.067
We should meet four times a week.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.654
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

20:39.821 --> 20:43.115
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

20:51.083 --> 20:53.334
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.044
She's gonna be yours.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.062
Great nap.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.273
It really was.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.459
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

21:36.378 --> 21:38.254
God!

21:43.969 --> 21:46.053
Excuse me.
