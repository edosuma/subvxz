I keep telling you,
commissioner, stop worrying.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.411
Batman will find him.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.045
Twenty minutes gone.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.714
Forty minutes remaining
for Bruce Wayne to appear

03:03.716 --> 03:05.816
and contact the criminal
or else..

03:05.818 --> 03:09.520
Oh, that poor,
<i> unfortunate</i> Mrs. Cooper.

03:09.522 --> 03:13.758
It always the poor ones who get
the worst of these games.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.725
Any luck, Chief O'Hara?

03:14.727 --> 03:17.561
Well, thank you.
Thank you just the same.

03:17.563 --> 03:18.763
Yeah, goodbye.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.298
Well, that's the last of them.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.832
I've called every
rich man's club

03:21.834 --> 03:23.634
and eatin' place in Gotham City.

03:23.636 --> 03:24.835
He's in none of them.

03:24.837 --> 03:25.703
These millionaires!

03:25.705 --> 03:29.640
It's hard for us to comprehend
the sort of lives they lead.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.075
Yeah, it's true, commissioner.

03:31.077 --> 03:34.045
I'll bet Mr. Wayne
is out on some yacht.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.547
Eatin' sherbet
and changing his clothes.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.448
Now, that's not true.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.950
Why do you jump
at me so, Boy Wonder?

03:39.952 --> 03:42.486
Gosh, chief, I'm sorry.
It's just that--

03:42.488 --> 03:43.788
There, Boy Wonder,
we understand.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.456
The lad's under
great strain, Chief O'Hara.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.892
No doubt he can't help imagine
himself in the position

03:47.894 --> 03:52.363
of young Dick Grayson, the
nephew of the kidnap victim.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.030
Right lad?

03:53.032 --> 03:54.398
Uh, so right, commissioner.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.399
Well, console yourself, my boy.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.102
We haven't been able to locate
young Dick Grayson either.

03:58.104 --> 04:02.973
He's fortunately ignorant
of this whole tragic situation.

04:02.975 --> 04:04.542
Twenty five minutes.

04:04.544 --> 04:08.713
Why the devil can't Batman
find Bruce Wayne?

04:11.484 --> 04:12.083
Am I in time?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.819
Thank heavens, Mr. Wayne.
I hope so.

04:14.821 --> 04:15.920
Our little team.
Chief O'Hara.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.723
- My pleasure, sir.
- And Robin, The Boy Wonder.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.791
I'm sure glad Batman
found you, Mr. Wayne.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.528
Me too, Robin. He located me
on the outskirts of my estate.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.697
- He asked me to give a message.
- Yes?

04:26.699 --> 04:28.566
Batman said,
"Tell Robin to carry on."

04:28.568 --> 04:31.435
He himself had to dash
in search of a clue.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.804
- What was it?
- He didn't stop to say.

04:33.806 --> 04:34.772
What's the situation here?

04:34.774 --> 04:37.408
Tight, Mr. Wayne.
Ugly, I'll explain on the way.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.610
- The way?
- Chief, alert my driver.

04:39.612 --> 04:40.378
Yes, sir.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.513
The criminal has asked
to make contact

04:42.515 --> 04:44.081
in a strange but clever manner.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.449
Over television, Mr. Wayne.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.017
I have every Gotham City channel

04:47.019 --> 04:48.152
waiting on standby.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.755
Let's go. Come on.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.906
Ladies and gentlemen, we
apologize for the interruption

05:08.908 --> 05:10.874
of our regularly
scheduled programs.

05:10.876 --> 05:12.442
This is a special announcement

05:12.444 --> 05:14.511
from Commissioner Gordon's
office.

05:14.513 --> 05:16.480
Switch it, Jewel.
Studio nine.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.949
You're on the air,
commissioner.

05:19.919 --> 05:20.551
Hello, criminals.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.487
Wherever you are out there.
Do you hear me, criminals?

05:23.489 --> 05:25.923
This is
Police Commissioner Gordon.

05:25.925 --> 05:26.957
I'm Bruce Wayne.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.292
And I'm Robin, Batman's aid.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.893
I speak for him officially.

05:29.895 --> 05:31.929
Our phone number is
555-2345.

05:31.931 --> 05:36.366
'I give you my word of honor
this line is not being traced.'

05:36.368 --> 05:37.901
That's right.
No trace.

05:37.903 --> 05:42.472
Our only interest is the safe
return of Mrs. Harriet Cooper.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.241
'We give crooks no quarter'

05:44.243 --> 05:47.110
'but we always deal
with them fairly too.'

05:47.112 --> 05:48.111
Ah, correct.

05:48.113 --> 05:49.246
Criminals, we don't wish
to undermine

05:49.248 --> 05:54.418
what little remaining faith you
might have in organized society.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.255
Yes.

05:59.258 --> 06:02.426
This line better not
be traced, my friends..

06:02.428 --> 06:05.830
...or it'll be very sad
for Mrs. Harriet Cooper.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.365
How is she?

06:11.604 --> 06:14.572
Oh, well, quite well,
Boy Wonder.

06:14.574 --> 06:15.973
At least as well as one can be

06:15.975 --> 06:20.744
in a straitjacket over a
fatal pool of flaming oil.

06:20.746 --> 06:22.046
You <i> devil!</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:25.316
How could a woman
stoop to such a trick?

06:25.318 --> 06:26.116
Talk of tricks.

06:26.118 --> 06:28.886
What about that phony
Star of Samarkand this morning?

06:28.888 --> 06:31.922
It was a fair weapon
in a fight against crime.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.124
You know that as well as I do.

06:34.126 --> 06:34.992
Enough of this prattle.

06:34.994 --> 06:38.629
Mr. Wayne, listen to my
instructions about the ransom.

06:38.631 --> 06:39.897
Wait.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.599
What? Are you trying
to give me orders?

06:41.801 --> 06:46.471
Wait, the Boy Wonder is about
to make a dramatic confession.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.638
That story in the paper

06:47.640 --> 06:50.341
about the bank money
being counterfeit

06:50.343 --> 06:52.143
'it was false.'

06:52.145 --> 06:53.311
What?

06:53.313 --> 06:54.245
It was a ruse.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.714
It was a Batman's trick
to make you try again.

06:56.716 --> 06:59.817
That money you stole
last night is real.

06:59.819 --> 07:03.888
A statement from the editor
of the Gotham City Times

07:03.890 --> 07:05.823
"This morning's headline..

07:05.825 --> 07:08.893
...was entirely untrue."

07:08.895 --> 07:10.394
Look.

07:10.996 --> 07:14.832
'It's signed and notarized.'

07:18.070 --> 07:19.436
'Let me add my assurance.'

07:19.438 --> 07:23.507
As the director of the first
national bank of Gotham City.

07:23.509 --> 07:26.877
let me tell you that the money
in your possession

07:26.879 --> 07:29.480
is <i> 100%</i> bonafide.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.981
You gotta believe Mr. Wayne.

07:30.983 --> 07:33.784
As bank director,
if he made a false statement

07:33.786 --> 07:35.452
he would be liable
to federal prosecution.

07:35.454 --> 07:36.954
- Yes.
- Don't you see out there?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.223
This reckless crime of yours
isn't necessary.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.158
You already have
your filthy lucre.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.962
For your own sake,
release Mrs. Cooper immediately.

07:44.964 --> 07:45.896
Oh, Come on, you crook.

07:45.898 --> 07:50.501
You can't be all bad.
Let the poor lady go, huh?

07:51.937 --> 07:54.338
Yes. Thank you.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.539
I believe you.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.475
It was only desperation
that drove me to this.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.911
You-you'll release your victim?

08:00.913 --> 08:03.648
At once, with pleasure.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.448
Where?

08:04.450 --> 08:06.917
Don't worry.
You'll find her.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.387
Goodbye.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.858
Goodbye.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.861
Ah, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

08:16.863 --> 08:17.728
Thank you very much.

08:18.330 --> 08:21.532
And now, we return you to our
regular scheduled program

08:21.534 --> 08:23.134
in progress.

08:25.437 --> 08:28.405
- Holy hallelujah! We did it.
- Thanks to you, Robin.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.274
It was your warm appeal
that turned the tide.

08:31.276 --> 08:32.208
I'll call Chief O'Hara.

08:32.211 --> 08:33.876
I'll put the entire
force on the alert.

08:33.879 --> 08:38.115
Get me Chief O'Hara.
Chief O'Hara, yes, thank you.

08:49.929 --> 08:50.995
Are you alright?

08:50.997 --> 08:52.530
Could I help you, madam?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.532
I'm Mrs. Harriet Cooper.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.466
The kidnap victim?

08:55.868 --> 08:59.169
Yes. Would someone please
call a policeman.

08:59.171 --> 09:02.373
My relatives must be
terribly worried.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.708
Yes, ma'am.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.715
<i> Scarcely minutes later</i>

09:11.717 --> 09:15.085
<i> back at stately Wayne Manor..</i>

09:15.321 --> 09:17.655
Is she alright, doctor?

09:17.657 --> 09:19.723
An amazing woman, Mr. Wayne.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.793
It was a real fight
to make her accept sedation.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.862
'Well, that's
Aunt Harriet all over.'

09:24.864 --> 09:27.665
You're sure she
had no clues to divulge

09:27.667 --> 09:28.899
about the crooks?

09:28.901 --> 09:29.667
Not one alas.

09:29.669 --> 09:33.404
It seems that the minute
she was lured into the taxi

09:33.406 --> 09:37.141
she was subjected to a potent
but harmless drug.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.276
Now, if you'll
excuse me, I must go.

09:39.278 --> 09:42.112
Yes, of course.
Thank you, doctor.

09:42.114 --> 09:45.749
I suppose you'll be wanting
to find Batman now?

09:45.751 --> 09:49.920
That's right, Mr. Wayne.
I will.

09:51.957 --> 09:52.990
What's the matter, Alfred?

09:52.992 --> 09:56.960
Excuse me, sir, but I can't
help feeling that this whole

09:56.962 --> 09:59.296
somber episode is my fault.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.464
Your fault?

10:00.466 --> 10:01.198
Indeed, sir.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.867
Had I not been down
dusting the Bat-cave

10:03.869 --> 10:05.703
when that false
phone call arrived..

10:05.705 --> 10:08.005
Good heavens!
Perish the thought, Alfred.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.240
You were performing
your proper duty.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.309
Begging you pardon, sir.
Not true.

10:12.311 --> 10:16.180
Ordinarily, I tend to the
Bat-cave on Wednesday evenings.

10:16.182 --> 10:20.184
I fail to do so
because of my addiction

10:20.186 --> 10:21.385
to a certain television program.

10:21.387 --> 10:24.121
Listen, Alfred,
rid yourself of guilt.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.122
That's right, Alfred.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.790
Aunt Harriet's fine now.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.791
She's more than fine.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.293
If it hadn't been
for her mishap

10:29.295 --> 10:31.995
I wouldn't have deduced
the criminal's identity.

10:31.997 --> 10:34.298
What? You know?

10:34.300 --> 10:34.998
Dear me.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.737
And I thought, uh, I thought
I discovered the decisive clue.

10:39.739 --> 10:43.774
This, uh,
book of matches, sir.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.776
The Gnome Book Store.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.745
Where did you find this, Alfred?

10:47.747 --> 10:48.479
'Just now, sir.'

10:48.481 --> 10:49.313
On the staircase.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.949
They must've fallen out
of Mrs. Cooper's pocket

10:51.951 --> 10:53.117
when we helped her upstairs.

10:53.119 --> 10:57.254
I had hoped that they might
indicate the whereabouts

10:57.256 --> 10:59.156
of the felon's lair.

10:59.158 --> 11:03.494
Nice thinking, Alfred.
Darn nice thinking.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.364
To the Bat-poles.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.480
Atomic batteries to power.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.182
Turbines to speed.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.768
Gosh, Batman, I'm stumped.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.337
Who the heck is the crook?

11:45.339 --> 11:46.972
Think over the clues.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.074
A female magician.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.609
So what use is that?

11:50.611 --> 11:52.010
Like we found in the files

11:52.012 --> 11:53.845
there are 27 female magicians

11:53.847 --> 11:55.847
licensed to practice
in Gotham City.

11:55.849 --> 11:56.781
Think harder.

11:56.783 --> 12:00.118
Remember what she told us
about Aunt Harriet's plight.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.254
Suspended in a
straitjacket over a..

12:03.256 --> 12:04.889
Holy birthday cake!

12:04.891 --> 12:05.323
Right.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.326
My last birthday,
you took me to see her.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.161
We even met her backstage.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.229
Zelda the great!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.330
Sure, I remember.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.966
That straitjacket escape
was her big gimmick.

12:14.968 --> 12:20.805
As usual, vain boasting has been
this criminal's undoing.

12:20.807 --> 12:21.373
Gosh, though.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.109
Where does this
Gnome book store come in?

12:24.111 --> 12:25.977
<i> Where indeed.</i>

12:25.979 --> 12:29.114
<i> For back behind</i>
<i> the phony book store</i>

12:29.116 --> 12:34.219
<i> Eivol is ready with his</i>
<i> inescapable Doom-Trap.</i>

12:36.823 --> 12:39.157
Well, well.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.092
Legal tender after all.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.728
Isn't life surprising, hmm?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.163
You have your money, Eivol.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.364
Now, tell me the secret.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.200
How do I escape
from the Doom-Trap?

12:49.202 --> 12:51.136
You mean you haven't
guessed, Zelda?

12:51.138 --> 12:53.705
Even after
the hint I gave you?

12:53.707 --> 12:55.840
- There is no way to escape.
- True.

12:55.842 --> 13:01.012
Even I, Eivol Ekdal, with all
my twisted Albanian genius.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.947
Even I cannot devise the answer.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.784
That is where Batman comes in.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.919
Oh, we lure him into the trap?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.287
Then he show us the way out?

13:09.289 --> 13:13.091
Exactly. We use him
as our pawn.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.259
Well, you mad Albanian.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.061
Even if Batman
does work out the trick

13:16.063 --> 13:18.863
how can I use it on stage
when Batman knows.

13:18.865 --> 13:23.201
We have an obscure peasant
saying in my country

13:23.203 --> 13:26.438
"Dead men tell no tales."

13:27.808 --> 13:28.773
Dead men?

13:28.775 --> 13:30.375
But of course, dear Zelda.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.278
After Batman escapes
from the Doom-Trap

13:33.280 --> 13:35.447
he walks into
instant liquidation.

13:35.449 --> 13:39.117
Wait, I show you.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.485
Ah..

13:40.487 --> 13:43.288
...gentlemen,
welcome, gentlemen.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.490
All set up for the rub out?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.225
Yes, yes.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.961
Show me the money.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.766
One hundred grand.

13:54.768 --> 13:59.070
- Don't bother to count.
- It might make us mad.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.745
It's like fringe benefit.

14:06.747 --> 14:09.781
Another $100,000 I get for..

14:09.783 --> 14:10.882
What is the word?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.450
...fingering Batman.

14:12.452 --> 14:16.121
I sign a contract
with the syndicate.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.289
Kidnapping, murder.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.090
Where will it end?

14:19.092 --> 14:22.127
- You know I abhor violence.
- You wretched weakling!

14:22.129 --> 14:24.929
You should've thought of that
before you rob your first bank.

14:24.931 --> 14:28.967
Now, stop the stupid questions
and think of a way to lure

14:28.969 --> 14:31.469
Batman into our trap.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.437
Done.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.171
What done?

14:33.173 --> 14:36.074
As I told you, Eivol,
I'd guessed your scheme.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.142
I cleverly left a clue.

14:37.144 --> 14:40.311
I stuck a book of your matches
in Mrs. Copper's pocket.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.248
No doubt he's
on his way already.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.816
Not a moment to lose.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.284
Gentlemen, into the sarcophagi.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.320
Quickly.
You see? They have peep holes.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.355
What's the shooting schedule?

14:50.357 --> 14:53.892
The instant Batman escapes
from the Doom-Trap, shoot!

14:53.894 --> 14:55.860
Why not shoot him
before he gets in?

14:55.862 --> 14:58.563
Because we need Batman
to show us how to escape

14:58.565 --> 15:01.332
from the Doom-Trap, you fools!

15:02.536 --> 15:04.302
Gentlemen, dear friends.

15:04.304 --> 15:09.841
Remember, contract calls for
bumping Batman after he escapes.

15:09.843 --> 15:10.875
It's in writing.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.111
Okay, if it's in writin'.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.914
Okay. Please gentlemen.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.599
There it is.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.077
Closed. Back in one hour.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.879
Could be a deception.

15:47.881 --> 15:48.613
Right you are.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.583
It's not even locked.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.558
Electric eye.

16:00.994 --> 16:04.362
Someone's coming into the shop.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.000
Quickly, Zelda, quickly.

16:09.002 --> 16:09.500
Where?

16:09.502 --> 16:13.471
Into my secret control booth.
In the wings.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.517
Quickly.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.888
You may look
in this periscope.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.161
Look, Batman,
a note on the counter.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.063
"To whom it may concern.

16:39.065 --> 16:42.901
"Try interesting volume
on top shelf

16:42.903 --> 16:46.170
last book of back row."

16:53.513 --> 16:55.179
Gosh! Could it concern us?

16:55.181 --> 16:58.182
It certainly could.
Look at that title.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.185
The truth about...bats.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.487
Wow!

17:05.125 --> 17:08.192
That book worked
a concealed switch.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.429
Let's see how
the plot goes, huh?

17:31.017 --> 17:32.450
Bizarre!

17:32.452 --> 17:34.485
A play without actors.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.055
This script could be for us.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.456
One way to find out.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.992
Let's get in the limelight.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.467
Look, in this booth.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.169
It's a bat.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.138
I bet it means something.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.416
Holy fish bowl!

18:05.418 --> 18:06.985
We're shut in.

18:06.987 --> 18:08.252
Got them.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.456
A trick magnetic padlock.

18:14.327 --> 18:19.230
Oh, it seems such a waste.
They're such handsome creatures.

18:19.232 --> 18:19.998
Shut up.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.301
Eivol, Eivol,
can I help being a woman.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.703
Shut up I said.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.574
Now, I turn on
the secret speakers

18:29.576 --> 18:32.410
hidden in the Doom-Trap.

18:32.412 --> 18:36.147
'Gosh, Batman!
What kinda trap is this?'

18:36.149 --> 18:38.683
It is a Doom-Trap, Boy Wonder.

18:38.685 --> 18:42.253
'Welcome to my greatest
achievement.'

18:42.255 --> 18:45.390
'The inescapable Doom-Trap.'

18:45.525 --> 18:46.758
Poor, twisted mind.

18:46.760 --> 18:50.194
'You stupid fools!
I am a genius.'

18:50.196 --> 18:53.097
Yeah, that's what they all say.

18:53.099 --> 18:56.200
Pipe down, Robin.
We have to humor him.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.336
What's the big idea, genius?

18:58.338 --> 19:00.671
Very simple, Batman.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.441
Try to escape.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.610
Let's just do that.

19:05.612 --> 19:06.778
Our utility belts.

19:08.148 --> 19:08.679
'Useless!'

19:08.681 --> 19:12.417
My jet age plastics
are impervious to your tools.

19:12.419 --> 19:18.122
Eivol, what if even Batman
cannot escape the trap?

19:18.124 --> 19:19.624
That will be very sad.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.460
Then I would have
to give back your money.

19:22.462 --> 19:27.131
Or I could go back
to the drawing board.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.103
Gosh, I'm afraid it's true.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.238
This stuff is tough.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.374
You are wasting time

19:36.376 --> 19:38.843
and you have so little left.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.313
Now..

19:42.315 --> 19:44.415
...look down at your feet.

19:44.551 --> 19:48.453
A deadly, colored gas
is issuing.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.456
Quick, let's get that grill.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.325
'Ow!'

19:55.695 --> 19:58.196
'Electrified.'

19:58.198 --> 19:59.697
Holy graveyard, Batman.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.365
'This could be...curtains.'

20:01.367 --> 20:04.502
'Don't quit, Robin.
Let's get our heads down.'

20:04.504 --> 20:06.504
'This gas is rising.'

20:06.506 --> 20:08.539
'Lighter than air.'

20:08.541 --> 20:12.710
'We'll have a few more
life-saving seconds.'

20:13.413 --> 20:16.214
Oh, what a noble struggle!

20:16.216 --> 20:19.450
'Hey, a gas lighter than air?'

20:19.452 --> 20:23.121
Must have...h-h-hydrogen in it.

20:23.123 --> 20:24.722
I-if we could electrify it.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.525
We can. High voltage grill.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.294
Metal buckles of our belts.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.596
Give me your utility belt

20:31.598 --> 20:33.531
and step back, Robin.

20:36.136 --> 20:38.903
'Alright. Here goes.'

20:41.608 --> 20:44.642
Sensational!
He has done it.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.615
Batman, watch out.
Those mummies!

21:07.567 --> 21:09.233
'Aah..'

21:09.235 --> 21:11.702
'Look, Batman.'

21:28.221 --> 21:29.387
Holy crossfire!

21:29.389 --> 21:32.890
Poised on their
own murderous petards.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.725
A couple of mummies.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.895
Let's taketh them
to the morgue.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.831
But where's Zelda.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.874
Look at her.
Glycerin tears.

22:01.288 --> 22:03.121
No, Robin.

22:03.290 --> 22:04.856
Real.

22:20.540 --> 22:25.210
Some other lifetime...Batman.

22:25.212 --> 22:26.945
Perhaps.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.547
Some other lifetime.

22:35.990 --> 22:41.293
<i> Some time later</i>
<i> at Gotham State Penitentiary</i>

22:41.295 --> 22:44.463
<i> female division..</i>

22:59.413 --> 23:00.912
Hello, Zelda.

23:00.914 --> 23:02.381
Hello, Mr. Wayne.

23:02.383 --> 23:03.949
I'll come right
to the point, Zelda.

23:03.951 --> 23:06.285
While I can't pretend
that your conduct

23:06.287 --> 23:07.019
has earned you any medals

23:07.021 --> 23:09.888
on the other hand,
you did save Batman's life

23:09.890 --> 23:11.890
and The Boy Wonder's too.

23:11.892 --> 23:14.960
It was the least
I could do, Mr. Wayne.

23:14.962 --> 23:15.761
True, true.

23:15.763 --> 23:18.764
But not many criminals
would see it that way.

23:18.766 --> 23:21.767
I think you've earned
a new chance.

23:21.769 --> 23:22.768
A new chance?

23:22.770 --> 23:24.936
The Wayne foundation
of which I'm the head

23:24.938 --> 23:27.539
maintains a number
of children's hospitals.

23:27.541 --> 23:28.774
Now, here's my offer.

23:28.776 --> 23:29.675
When you get out of here

23:29.677 --> 23:33.312
I'll see you get a position
in one of those hospitals

23:33.314 --> 23:35.314
as resident lady magician.

23:35.316 --> 23:36.948
Oh, how wonderful.

23:36.950 --> 23:39.718
What a joy to entertain
small children.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.787
I'm glad you feel that way.

23:41.789 --> 23:43.322
Consider it settled then.

23:43.324 --> 23:45.957
- Goodbye.
- Wait please.

23:49.230 --> 23:51.297
Good heavens.

23:57.204 --> 23:59.338
If you ever see him

23:59.340 --> 24:01.173
give this to Batman.

24:01.175 --> 24:04.343
Please? Will you, Mr. Wayne?
