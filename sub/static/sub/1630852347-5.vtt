Ahoy!
What am I doing?

10:17.116 --> 10:18.367
Seth, you're right!

10:18.451 --> 10:20.870
That iceberg<i> is</i> like me.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.496
Because it's strong.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.707
It's like mom because
it's beautiful,

10:24.790 --> 10:26.917
and it's like you
because it's...

10:27.001 --> 10:28.544
cold to the touch.

10:28.627 --> 10:31.714
And it's like Pooger
because it's always around,

10:31.797 --> 10:36.344
and kind of following y--

10:36.427 --> 10:40.389
welcome to me ship, there's
your complimentary towel...

10:40.473 --> 10:42.475
Sorry for
losing it back there.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.478
No, no, I'm sorry
for pushing you.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.064
And I did get
to see the iceberg.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.025
Beefy?
Of course you can join my crew!

10:51.108 --> 10:52.943
You all can!

10:53.027 --> 10:56.447
I guess everything worked out
for everyone!

10:56.530 --> 10:58.324
Beefy:
What?! I'm ruined!

10:58.407 --> 11:01.077
How do you lose
a fifty-three-thousand-ton ship

11:01.160 --> 11:02.828
and a crew
full of Beefies?!
[Laughing ]

11:02.912 --> 11:04.622
Stop that.
Stop laughing!

11:04.705 --> 11:06.082
Why are you laughing?!

11:06.165 --> 11:12.088

11:12.171 --> 11:17.927
