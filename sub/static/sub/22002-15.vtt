WEBVTT

00:00.103 --> 00:01.403
Santiago, your test results

00:01.438 --> 00:02.996
from the sergeant's exam have arrived.

00:03.031 --> 00:04.798
Ooh, everybody make room.

00:04.833 --> 00:07.582
Amy needs adequate space
to do her signature dork dance.

00:07.618 --> 00:09.218
I don't know if there's
going to be a dork dance.

00:09.253 --> 00:10.686
I mean, look how small that envelope is.

00:10.721 --> 00:12.254
That's not a big, good news envelope.

00:12.289 --> 00:13.823
That's a little, bad news envelope.

00:13.858 --> 00:16.158
What? That's nuts.
Sarge, tell her envelope size

00:16.193 --> 00:17.827
- doesn't matter.
- If I'm being honest,

00:17.862 --> 00:19.495
- I got a much bigger envelope.
- Oh, God.

00:19.530 --> 00:20.729
Unhelpful, Terry. Very unhelpful.

00:20.764 --> 00:22.298
- Mine was bigger, too.
- Okay.

00:22.333 --> 00:23.466
I just won't ever open it.

00:23.501 --> 00:24.800
That way, I'll never get rejected.

00:24.835 --> 00:26.435
- Fine, I'll open it.
- No!

00:26.470 --> 00:27.636
Oh, whoa!

00:27.671 --> 00:28.671
Do it harder.

00:28.706 --> 00:29.859
I opened it.

00:30.241 --> 00:32.475
- You passed.
- Oh, my God.

00:32.509 --> 00:33.742
I'm going to be a sergeant.

00:33.777 --> 00:34.877
You're going to be a sergeant!

00:34.912 --> 00:36.545
Yes!

00:36.580 --> 00:38.781
♪ Oh, no, it's happening. ♪

00:38.816 --> 00:40.616
Whoo!

00:40.651 --> 00:43.419
- Yeah!
- That's my future wife!

00:43.454 --> 00:44.920
So...

01:05.230 --> 01:08.099
Amy Santiago, put down that melon,

01:08.135 --> 01:10.179
for you are about to feast your eyes

01:10.214 --> 01:13.282
on one of the most delicious
cases in the NYPD.

01:13.317 --> 01:14.950
I don't like the personality
I've chosen here.

01:14.985 --> 01:16.852
I do. You sound like Caesar Flickerman

01:16.887 --> 01:19.288
welcoming new "Hunger Games"
tributes to the Quarter Quell.

01:19.323 --> 01:20.623
- What's going on, Jake?
- In one week,

01:20.658 --> 01:21.891
you will officially become a sergeant.

01:21.926 --> 01:23.325
Which means this case
will be the last one

01:23.360 --> 01:25.728
we ever work together as detectives,
so it has to be perfect.

01:25.763 --> 01:28.898
I present to you a serial arson case.

01:28.933 --> 01:30.866
- Mm-hmm.
- And the fires seem to be

01:30.901 --> 01:33.536
connected to the Saturday
crossword puzzle.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.737
- Mama like.
- Two different buildings,

01:34.772 --> 01:36.238
two consecutive Saturdays,

01:36.273 --> 01:37.982
and a puzzle left at each crime scene,

01:38.018 --> 01:40.174
and a note was sent
to the puzzle's author,

01:40.210 --> 01:43.579
- Mr. Melvin Stermley.
- Melvin Stermley?

01:43.614 --> 01:45.581
He's the best in the game!

01:45.616 --> 01:47.516
He made a puzzle once
where all the answers

01:47.551 --> 01:49.752
were just the word "puzzle"
in different languages.

01:49.787 --> 01:53.756
- In Estonian, it was moistatus.
- Yeah, well, your moistatus

01:53.791 --> 01:55.558
is about to be hecka moist...

01:55.593 --> 01:57.293
don't call HR, we are getting married...

01:57.328 --> 01:58.694
because Melvin Stermley is coming in

01:58.729 --> 02:01.375
- to help us with the case!
- Sha-wing!

02:01.865 --> 02:04.533
Hey, I was going through your
calendar for some reason.

02:04.568 --> 02:06.902
- It's your job.
- Right.

02:06.937 --> 02:09.805
Anyhoobs, I wanted to remind
you about the commissioner

02:09.840 --> 02:12.341
candidate meet and greet,
and your presentation

02:12.376 --> 02:13.742
to the selection committee.

02:13.777 --> 02:15.344
Being that I am your campaign manager...

02:15.379 --> 02:16.912
- You are not.
- I did a little sleuthing

02:16.947 --> 02:19.348
on your rivals.
You want me to spill the beans?

02:19.383 --> 02:21.283
Why would you ever
intentionally spill beans?

02:21.318 --> 02:23.652
They're one of nature's most
densely packed protein sources,

02:23.687 --> 02:26.355
and they remain unsullied by flavor.

02:26.390 --> 02:28.290
Okay, forget it, I'll just mosey on out.

02:28.325 --> 02:30.292
Fine, fine, tell me everything.

02:30.327 --> 02:32.895
All right, have a seat. It's Gina time.

02:32.930 --> 02:34.997
Say hello to your compe-tish.

02:35.032 --> 02:38.968
Bryan McCann, John Kelly,
and John Kelly.

02:39.003 --> 02:41.637
Yes, that's right,
there are two John Kellys.

02:41.672 --> 02:43.606
How are these not the same man?

02:43.641 --> 02:46.508
You should see their wives.
Or should I say, wife.

02:46.543 --> 02:48.444
Good God, do you know what
their speeches are about?

02:48.479 --> 02:49.778
I do.

02:49.813 --> 02:51.447
"Staying the course."

02:51.482 --> 02:52.881
"Maintaining the course," and

02:52.916 --> 02:55.284
"Blazing a path to a new future."

02:55.319 --> 02:57.052
I'm kidding, it's
"Remaining on the course."

02:57.087 --> 02:58.587
Unbelievable, none of these men

02:58.622 --> 03:00.656
have any interest in advancing the NYPD.

03:00.691 --> 03:02.591
That's right, because they're dinosaurs.

03:02.626 --> 03:04.426
But do you know what kills dinosaurs?

03:04.461 --> 03:05.494
- Asteroids?
- No.

03:05.529 --> 03:07.029
You-steroids.

03:07.064 --> 03:09.390
You are going to kill these dinosaurs.

03:10.434 --> 03:12.935
Hey, hey dum-dum. What are you thinking?

03:12.970 --> 03:14.803
Introducing Amy to her celebrity crush?

03:14.838 --> 03:16.705
- Are you insane?
- Relax, Charles.

03:16.740 --> 03:18.888
It's not a crush, it's her
nerdy crossword puzzling hero.

03:18.924 --> 03:20.376
I mean, the guy's
got to be a massive dork.

03:20.411 --> 03:22.011
His name is Melvin Stermley,
for God's sake.

03:22.046 --> 03:24.265
Jake, he's here. Come meet Melvin.

03:24.715 --> 03:26.872
Hey, you can call me Vin.

03:27.851 --> 03:30.686
But, where is nerd?

03:32.923 --> 03:34.857
Whoa, is this a new detective car?

03:34.892 --> 03:36.859
It sure is, I put in the paperwork

03:36.894 --> 03:40.062
18 months ago, and got lucky.
They fast tracked it!

03:40.097 --> 03:44.033
Say hello to the Nine-Nine's
brand new, fully loaded,

03:44.068 --> 03:46.502
sweet-as-hell crime-crusher on wheels!

03:46.537 --> 03:50.005
Holy crap, it has a heads-up display
with built-in license plate reader.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.840
Who cares. It's got two burrito holders.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.359
- Those are cup holders, Scully.
- Oh yeah?

03:53.395 --> 03:55.332
Then what am I supposed
to use my thighs for, genius?

03:55.368 --> 03:57.796
Wait, who are you assigning
this car to, Sarge?

03:57.832 --> 04:00.462
Um, I was actually thinking
I'd get this one.

04:00.498 --> 04:01.750
- Seriously?
- You suck.

04:01.785 --> 04:03.686
Whoa, the heater in my detective car

04:03.721 --> 04:06.021
hasn't worked in two years.
I don't have enough body fat

04:06.056 --> 04:07.623
to keep warm, Terry's sick of shivering.

04:07.658 --> 04:09.124
Okay, just seems a little selfish

04:09.159 --> 04:10.592
to keep it for yourself
when your detectives,

04:10.627 --> 04:11.927
who you took an oath to protect,

04:11.962 --> 04:13.729
are stuck driving their crappy old cars.

04:13.764 --> 04:16.098
- Mine's the oldest.
- I've never felt so abandoned.

04:16.132 --> 04:18.701
And I was actually abandoned.
They found me in a swamp.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.769
Fine. We'll do a drawing for it.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.738
But until then, no one touches it.

04:22.773 --> 04:24.106
Oops, too late.

04:24.141 --> 04:26.008
I left a ranch handprint
on the windshield.

04:26.043 --> 04:27.609
Okay, so here are your puzzles

04:27.644 --> 04:29.144
from the days the arsonist set the fire.

04:29.179 --> 04:31.013
This is really good, Amy, thanks.

04:31.048 --> 04:33.982
Hey, so Vin, just curious.
Would you say you have

04:34.017 --> 04:35.918
the typical physique
of a puzzle maker, or?

04:35.953 --> 04:37.753
Well, each puzzle only pays
a couple hundred bucks,

04:37.788 --> 04:39.479
so I mostly make my money modeling.

04:39.885 --> 04:41.495
- Primarily swimwear.
- Yeah, I hear that.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.407
I could do that too, but I
make pretty good money here,

04:43.443 --> 04:44.400
so I don't really need to.

04:44.436 --> 04:45.594
Anyways, let's talk about the case.

04:45.629 --> 04:47.863
So here's the letter that
the arsonist sent to Vin.

04:47.898 --> 04:50.866
"Your clues I discombobulate
to teach you to conjugate,

04:50.901 --> 04:53.969
the fool who fails to validate
will watch as I conflagrate."

04:54.004 --> 04:56.071
It seems like he's using my
crossword to tell me something.

04:56.106 --> 04:59.541
Oh, maybe we should look
at anagrams of the answers.

04:59.576 --> 05:01.577
That's really good, "o nasty amiga!"

05:01.612 --> 05:03.412
Oh, what?

05:03.447 --> 05:05.514
He re-arranged the letters
of "Amy Santiago."

05:05.549 --> 05:08.550
He anagrammed me! Vin, do Jake Peralta.

05:08.585 --> 05:10.085
- I doubt that's even possible.
- Eat a jerk, pal.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.054
What, no one's ever said that phrase.

05:12.089 --> 05:14.022
I really think this anagram
approach makes a lot of sense.

05:14.057 --> 05:15.524
Seriously? Let's do it.

05:15.559 --> 05:16.959
I'll take even clues, you take odds.

05:16.994 --> 05:20.095
Great, and I will take
everyone's coffee order.

05:20.130 --> 05:21.864
- That's equally helpful.
- I don't drink coffee.

05:21.899 --> 05:23.920
- But I'd love a kombucha.
- Great, I'll just...

05:24.201 --> 05:25.868
walk to the kombucha store.

05:25.903 --> 05:28.543
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, of course.

05:29.072 --> 05:30.906
You can't wear a coat over a tank,

05:30.941 --> 05:33.709
- You're not Ryan Gosling.
- Feeling jealous, buddy?

05:33.744 --> 05:35.744
No, not at all.
I mean, I am a little surprised

05:35.779 --> 05:37.980
that somebody named Melvin
is so bodacious,

05:38.015 --> 05:40.082
but I feel that jealousy
is an ugly emotion.

05:40.117 --> 05:41.683
- That you are feeling.
- And I'm just glad

05:41.718 --> 05:43.118
that Amy is spending
some time with her hero.

05:43.153 --> 05:44.720
- Who is super hot.
- Charles, let it go.

05:44.755 --> 05:45.954
- And smart.
- I'm serious, stop.

05:47.758 --> 05:49.284
And hilarious.

05:49.660 --> 05:50.905
Eat a jerk, pal!

05:52.639 --> 05:53.872
So, how's it going in here?

05:53.907 --> 05:55.174
Vin, I see you're still coatless.

05:55.210 --> 05:56.981
- I run hot, like a wolf.
- Oh, I see.

05:57.017 --> 05:58.555
I wonder if the word "conjugate"

05:58.591 --> 06:00.023
in the arsonist's letter means we should

06:00.059 --> 06:03.085
- focus on the verb answers.
- Cool, I love verbs.

06:03.121 --> 06:05.583
- Second favorite part of speech.
- After prepositions.

06:05.618 --> 06:07.758
Yeah, words are cool.

06:07.794 --> 06:09.286
But maybe we should switch gears a bit,

06:09.322 --> 06:11.189
and get back to some good
old-fashioned police work.

06:11.225 --> 06:12.724
- What are you thinking?
- Well, whoever's setting

06:12.759 --> 06:14.392
these fires is clearly trying
to humiliate Vin.

06:14.427 --> 06:15.960
You know, make a puzzle he can't solve.

06:15.995 --> 06:17.795
So maybe we should focus
on people that don't like you.

06:17.830 --> 06:19.497
Jake has a point about motive.

06:19.532 --> 06:20.899
Maybe another puzzler
wants to take you down.

06:20.934 --> 06:22.800
Well, if you're
looking for a puzzle head,

06:22.835 --> 06:24.969
I'm hosting a crossword night
at the Turnkey Bar tonight.

06:25.004 --> 06:26.771
Oh, I've always wanted to go there.

06:26.806 --> 06:28.806
That place is a total puzz-hang.

06:28.841 --> 06:31.109
Ah, gross, all right,
so we'll go undercover,

06:31.144 --> 06:33.077
chat some people up, and see
if we can't find our arsonist.

06:33.112 --> 06:35.046
- Good idea.
- Oh, Amy likes my plan.

06:35.081 --> 06:39.517
Great, so Vin, why don't we
just get this coat back on you,

06:39.552 --> 06:41.786
and I'll help you
get out of the door, here.

06:41.821 --> 06:44.155
And we'll see you tonight, okay, bye!

06:44.190 --> 06:46.524
- The best.
- Right?

06:46.559 --> 06:48.092
Yeah!

06:48.295 --> 06:50.628
Wow, the competition
looks even older in person.

06:50.663 --> 06:52.664
What do you think these
dinosaurs are talking about?

06:52.699 --> 06:54.198
Where to find "Matlock" reruns?

06:54.233 --> 06:55.767
Be professional, Gina.

06:55.802 --> 06:57.435
Like the homecare nurses

06:57.470 --> 06:58.970
who will tuck them into bed tonight.

07:00.206 --> 07:01.906
- Oh, hello, John.
- Raymond.

07:01.941 --> 07:03.141
I just want to say what an honor it is

07:03.176 --> 07:04.509
to be up for the same job

07:04.544 --> 07:07.412
as a man with your... experience.

07:07.587 --> 07:08.674
Thank you.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.450
I paused suggestively
before I said "experience,"

07:12.485 --> 07:14.485
so he would know
it wasn't really a compliment.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.854
Who are you talking to?
I invented the pause.

07:16.889 --> 07:19.457
Raymond Holt,
I'm Captain Olivia Crawford.

07:19.671 --> 07:21.366
I'm the new candidate for commissioner.

07:21.402 --> 07:22.420
- Oh?
- Excuse me?

07:22.433 --> 07:23.694
Yeah, I replaced the other candidate.

07:23.730 --> 07:25.730
He retired to spend more time
with his grandchildren.

07:25.765 --> 07:27.899
Anyway, I just wanted to say
what a privilege it is

07:27.934 --> 07:32.670
to be up for the same job
as a man with your... tenure.

07:32.705 --> 07:35.673
- Oh, damn, she paused, dude.
- In error, I am certain.

07:35.708 --> 07:36.908
Olivia, I may be older than you,

07:36.943 --> 07:38.476
but I am not some dinosaur

07:38.511 --> 07:40.011
intent on maintaining the status quo.

07:40.046 --> 07:43.047
For example, I would add
a social media officer

07:43.082 --> 07:44.860
- to every precinct.
- Interesting.

07:45.438 --> 07:47.719
I plan on eliminating
precincts all together.

07:47.754 --> 07:49.887
What, no precincts?
That's not how we do things.

07:49.922 --> 07:52.387
That's exactly what
both John Kellys said.

07:53.593 --> 07:56.527
Oh no, she's the asteroid.

07:56.562 --> 07:58.985
And I don't want to say
you're a dinosaur, but...

07:59.381 --> 08:00.981
You're a dinosaur.

08:01.134 --> 08:03.901
Wow, a whole crowd full of puzzlers.

08:03.936 --> 08:05.770
Gotta be honest,
I'm a little disappointed

08:05.805 --> 08:07.639
no one's wearing a green suit
covered in question marks.

08:07.674 --> 08:09.240
That guy has crossword puzzle pants.

08:09.275 --> 08:12.543
- Does that scratch your itch?
- Very much so, thanks.

08:12.578 --> 08:14.825
All right, we should probably
start talking to people in line.

08:15.281 --> 08:17.015
Pardon me there, fellow puzzler.

08:17.050 --> 08:18.816
What do you think of Melvin Stermley?

08:18.851 --> 08:20.685
Uh, you mean my future husband?

08:20.720 --> 08:22.120
Oh, so you like his puzzles?

08:22.155 --> 08:24.555
And his face, body, and brain...
and body.

08:24.590 --> 08:25.690
Honestly, Vin makes all other men

08:25.725 --> 08:27.525
seem really stupid and ugly.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.760
Okay, well, thank you for your

08:28.795 --> 08:30.351
very candid and hurtful input.

08:30.663 --> 08:33.063
You must solve
one of Vin's puzzles to enter.

08:33.099 --> 08:34.999
Rearrange the letters of this phrase

08:35.034 --> 08:36.900
to reveal a place in the world.

08:36.953 --> 08:39.602
"Meet a brainier stud, a."

08:39.639 --> 08:41.938
Oh, come on, there's no place
with that many letters in it.

08:41.974 --> 08:43.808
I mean, most places
are, like, four letters.

08:43.842 --> 08:47.145
- You know, park, mall, dump...
- United Arab Emirates!

08:47.180 --> 08:49.180
You may enter.

08:49.215 --> 08:51.315
Uh, you must each answer a puzzle.

08:51.350 --> 08:53.184
Oh... great.

08:53.219 --> 08:55.186
Unscramble the letters in this phrase

08:55.221 --> 08:58.089
to reveal the name of a film
based on a classic novel.

08:58.124 --> 09:00.958
- Okay.
- "Sad anus loser, I go in"

09:00.993 --> 09:03.628
You know, I feel like these puzzles
are actually very pointed.

09:03.663 --> 09:05.196
Forget it, I got this.

09:05.231 --> 09:07.198
Uh, A, R, uh...

09:08.901 --> 09:10.234
Puzzle solved.

09:15.842 --> 09:18.150
Who's the anus loser now?

09:19.145 --> 09:21.307
It's still me.

09:21.647 --> 09:24.248
Okay, one of us is about to get access

09:24.283 --> 09:27.618
to the best detective car ever,
and everyone else

09:27.653 --> 09:29.587
will go back to driving junk cars

09:29.622 --> 09:31.022
for the rest of your junk lives.

09:31.057 --> 09:32.857
Damn, Sarge, that took a dark turn.

09:32.892 --> 09:35.031
I want seat warmers. I want them bad.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.194
I need this car too.

09:36.229 --> 09:38.229
I'm sick of riding my
Vespa to work every day.

09:38.264 --> 09:40.098
Well, being on the seat
behind you is no picnic either.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.466
All right, here it goes.

09:44.737 --> 09:46.804
What?

09:46.839 --> 09:50.041
Oh, my God, it says "Terry." I won!

09:50.076 --> 09:52.710
♪ Terry got a car, Terry got a car ♪

09:52.745 --> 09:54.045
No way. You cheated.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.047
What? I didn't cheat.

09:56.082 --> 09:57.694
I bet every slip in there says Terry.

09:59.919 --> 10:01.853
He filled it full of fake people.

10:01.888 --> 10:04.122
- Who the hell is Norm?
- That's Scully's first name.

10:04.157 --> 10:05.923
- It is?
- Stop being sore losers.

10:05.958 --> 10:07.258
I won fair and square.

10:07.293 --> 10:08.926
No, you won unfair and un-square,

10:08.961 --> 10:10.995
- and I'm going to prove it.
- And if we can't,

10:11.030 --> 10:12.464
- we'll plant it.
- No.

10:12.832 --> 10:14.182
Charles, I need your help.

10:14.236 --> 10:15.767
What's the best way
to dry out a pant leg that's

10:15.802 --> 10:17.702
- been soaked in toilet water?
<i>- Wait 28 minutes.</i>

10:17.737 --> 10:19.637
Trust me, that's how long it
takes for toilet pants to dry.

10:19.672 --> 10:21.172
Well, I can't just be standing around

10:21.207 --> 10:23.107
for half an hour while
Amy chats it up with Vin.

10:23.142 --> 10:26.377
Ah, so it's not toilet water.
You're drenched in jealousy.

10:26.412 --> 10:29.412
I told you before, jealousy is an
ugly emotion that I don't feel.

10:29.448 --> 10:31.202
Besides, Amy picked
my plan to come here.

10:31.238 --> 10:32.369
Why would I be jealous of Vin?

10:32.405 --> 10:35.286
Because of his body, and
face, and brain... and body.

10:35.321 --> 10:36.921
Why does everybody say "body" twice?

10:36.956 --> 10:38.389
Oh, hang on a second.

10:38.424 --> 10:40.091
- Somebody's coming.
- Vin is on fire tonight.

10:40.126 --> 10:42.026
- He's phenomenal.
- No wonder the Saturday

10:42.061 --> 10:43.995
crossword replaced Sam with him.

10:44.030 --> 10:46.264
- Sam must be pissed.
- I heard the only place

10:46.299 --> 10:48.366
that buys his puzzles now
is "Parade" magazine.

10:48.401 --> 10:50.668
The hardest clue he had in his last one

10:50.703 --> 10:52.770
was a five-letter word for a game

10:52.805 --> 10:55.273
- popular in nursing homes.
- Bingo.

10:55.308 --> 10:56.841
I figured out who the arsonist is.

10:56.876 --> 10:58.876
It's this guy named Sam.
He's a puzzle maker.

10:58.911 --> 11:01.377
- And Vin took his job.
- Sam Jepson?

11:01.413 --> 11:02.470
Oh, he's not the arsonist.

11:02.506 --> 11:03.664
He's been out of town for weeks.

11:03.699 --> 11:04.833
And he's one of my closest friends.

11:04.869 --> 11:06.267
He let me stay on his couch

11:06.302 --> 11:07.701
when Anna Kournikova and I broke up.

11:07.736 --> 11:09.837
Well, I mean, she never won a major, so.

11:09.872 --> 11:11.839
All right, fine, if I'm so
wrong, what did you guys find?

11:11.874 --> 11:13.440
Both fires were located

11:13.475 --> 11:14.810
at the intersection of numbered streets.

11:14.846 --> 11:16.379
If you match those
intersections with the same

11:16.415 --> 11:18.482
intersections of the
numbered clues in the puzzles,

11:18.518 --> 11:20.056
you get the letters "MA".

11:20.092 --> 11:21.814
We think the arsonist
is spelling his name.

11:21.850 --> 11:24.651
We can build a puzzle around that,
and catch him setting his next fire.

11:24.687 --> 11:27.133
But we have a suspect
with a crystal clear motive.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.537
I think we need to solve this
like cops, not puzzlers.

11:29.573 --> 11:31.373
I hear you, Jake.
But people who make crosswords

11:31.409 --> 11:32.976
love hiding their names
in their puzzles.

11:33.012 --> 11:34.378
It's our version of a self portrait.

11:34.414 --> 11:35.947
All right, you know what?

11:35.983 --> 11:38.017
Amy, it's your last case, you decide.

11:38.053 --> 11:39.832
Should we go with
Vin's wacky little plan,

11:39.868 --> 11:41.874
or should we go with Sam Jepson,

11:41.910 --> 11:43.809
my exceptionally solid lead?

11:43.845 --> 11:47.138
I see where you're coming from,
Jake, but this is Vin's world,

11:47.174 --> 11:49.174
and I think we should
go with his strategy.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.822
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

11:51.187 --> 11:53.688
- Yeah, sounds great.
- Okay, great.

11:53.724 --> 11:55.754
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.186
Oh, no, ugly emotion.

12:00.518 --> 12:02.858
Okay, so we think the
arsonist is using the fires

12:02.894 --> 12:04.039
to spell out his name.

12:04.075 --> 12:05.142
The most common third letter

12:05.178 --> 12:07.671
in names that start with "MA"
are L for Malcolm,

12:07.707 --> 12:09.674
X for Max, R for Mark,
and T for Matthew.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.910
Or his name is Sam,
and he's spelling it backwards.

12:11.945 --> 12:13.083
Uh-huh.

12:13.613 --> 12:15.780
Let's just stick with the LXRT plan.

12:15.815 --> 12:17.616
- Copy that.
- Vin designed today's puzzle

12:17.651 --> 12:19.417
using only one of each of those letters.

12:19.452 --> 12:21.637
Isn't that the craziest
thing you've ever seen?

12:21.673 --> 12:22.772
I don't know, I mean, remember that time

12:22.808 --> 12:24.422
we investigated the
disappearance of Mrs. Jackson,

12:24.457 --> 12:26.391
and it turned out her
parrot ate her, bones and all?

12:26.426 --> 12:28.293
- That was pretty crazy.
- That was crazy.

12:28.328 --> 12:29.861
Yeah.

12:29.896 --> 12:31.663
So tonight, we'll stake
out the intersections

12:31.698 --> 12:33.899
that correspond to where
the L, X, R, and T are

12:33.934 --> 12:36.568
in Vin's puzzle, and hopefully
catch the arsonist in the act.

12:36.603 --> 12:39.771
I'll take the MAT corner,
you take the MAR corner,

12:39.806 --> 12:42.440
and we'll have patrolman
take the MAL and MAX.

12:42.475 --> 12:44.024
- Cool?
- Yep, very cool.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.694
Okay, great, I'll get
the surveillance equipment.

12:47.163 --> 12:48.432
Shame.

12:48.648 --> 12:50.448
Shame, shame, shame.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.521
I can't believe you're doing Vin's plan.

12:52.557 --> 12:54.157
Will you relax? I'm only doing it

12:54.193 --> 12:55.601
because someone else
is going to do my plan.

12:55.637 --> 12:56.803
- Who?
- You.

12:56.839 --> 12:58.080
- Oh.
- While I'm busy watching

12:58.116 --> 12:59.276
nothing happen on my stupid corner,

12:59.312 --> 13:00.345
you're going to stake
out Sam's apartment.

13:00.381 --> 13:02.526
Then when he sets a fire,
Vin is going to look like a dummy.

13:02.562 --> 13:04.647
That's right, use the jealousy, Jake.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.627
It will give you unimaginable power.

13:06.663 --> 13:09.751
Yes, yes, I can feel it
coursing through my veins.

13:09.787 --> 13:10.853
- Oh, my hand cramped.
- Oh.

13:10.889 --> 13:12.060
Oh, it's stuck in a claw.

13:12.155 --> 13:13.655
- It's a claw now.
- Oh.

13:13.912 --> 13:16.358
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

13:16.393 --> 13:18.293
You're snacking? This is from the guy

13:18.328 --> 13:20.095
who told me that eating finger foods

13:20.130 --> 13:21.596
was the one true sign of depression?

13:21.631 --> 13:23.298
Then watch me chew, Gina.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.500
I'm a creature of the past.
I'm a dinosaur.

13:25.535 --> 13:28.236
No, you are not, you're
the best man for the job.

13:28.271 --> 13:30.105
And I think you know what
you have to do to get it.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.895
Believe in myself
and give a great presentation?

13:32.931 --> 13:34.044
Not even close.

13:34.335 --> 13:37.479
That's the head of the committee
over there, gorging on crab cakes.

13:37.514 --> 13:39.348
Just go up to him and sabotage Olivia.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.568
Um...

13:40.841 --> 13:42.551
- I don't think I can do that.
- Well, you can't really be

13:42.586 --> 13:44.686
the best commissioner
the NYPD has ever had

13:44.721 --> 13:46.690
if you're not the commissioner.

13:47.747 --> 13:51.174
Right. You're right, I want this.

13:51.833 --> 13:54.396
And I will do good things for the city.

13:54.431 --> 13:56.698
Yes, you will. Now, get over there,

13:56.733 --> 14:00.093
and crap all over Olivia's ideas.

14:01.037 --> 14:03.539
- Patrick, nice to see you.
- Hello, Raymond.

14:04.601 --> 14:06.241
- Shall we small-talk?
- Mm.

14:06.276 --> 14:08.210
I've been thinking recently
about how vital

14:08.245 --> 14:10.712
the existence of precincts
is to the NYPD.

14:10.747 --> 14:12.865
Oh, you spoke to Crawford.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.283
She's very forward thinking, isn't she?

14:15.318 --> 14:17.219
I suppose you could call it that.

14:17.254 --> 14:18.754
I mean, I wouldn't, but...

14:18.789 --> 14:21.375
Ray, you don't need to worry about her.

14:22.125 --> 14:26.495
Between you and me, we had to
nominate a girl for PR reasons.

14:26.813 --> 14:28.363
There's no way the NYPD

14:28.398 --> 14:30.859
is ready for a female commissioner.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.402
- Oh.
- Hey.

14:33.437 --> 14:35.203
Grab a crab cake before we start.

14:35.238 --> 14:37.194
Real crab, big chunks.

14:40.382 --> 14:42.644
Okay, no one saw Sarge
do anything suspicious

14:42.679 --> 14:44.479
on the day of the drawing.
We got nothing.

14:44.514 --> 14:47.021
Speak for yourself, sister.
We found a smoking gun.

14:47.057 --> 14:48.056
Play it, Hitchcock.

14:48.092 --> 14:49.250
- Voila.
- Bah-boom.

14:49.286 --> 14:51.253
- What, I don't see anything.
- Focus on the butt.

14:51.289 --> 14:53.998
- The butt don't lie.
- He squeezed his cheeks

14:54.034 --> 14:56.291
before he opened the slip.
He knew his name was on it.

14:56.326 --> 14:58.059
It was a pre-emptive celebration clench.

14:58.094 --> 15:00.328
I don't know, we need better
proof than a butt clench

15:00.363 --> 15:02.564
- to take down Terry.
- I did it, okay?

15:02.599 --> 15:05.767
I cheated. I wanted that car,
and I took it.

15:05.802 --> 15:08.437
And it's killing me.
I couldn't sleep all night.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.439
I just kept hearing the blinker.

15:10.474 --> 15:13.408
You-cheat, you-cheat, you-cheat.

15:13.443 --> 15:15.710
Here are the keys. Take the damn car.

15:15.745 --> 15:17.186
Terry doesn't deserve it.

15:18.015 --> 15:20.582
And that is why I became a cop.

15:22.252 --> 15:24.820
Hey, Charles, nothing's
happening on my MAR corner.

15:24.855 --> 15:27.556
- Any movement at Sam's place?
- No, I did, however, see

15:27.591 --> 15:30.091
a cool-looking dude in a ponytail
on a Razor scooter.

15:30.126 --> 15:31.760
I have to admit, I like the look.

15:31.795 --> 15:34.229
Is it possible I'm wrong,
and Sam is out of town?

15:34.264 --> 15:35.897
Vin's plan is actually kind of smart.

15:35.932 --> 15:38.733
- Jake, I have eyes on Sam.
<i>- Yes, suck it, Vin.</i>

15:38.768 --> 15:40.368
My judgment is clear, and I am a genius.

15:40.403 --> 15:41.603
Charles, I'll be right there.

15:41.821 --> 15:43.438
But enough about the crab cakes.

15:43.473 --> 15:46.408
Our first presentation tonight

15:46.443 --> 15:48.443
will be from the 99th precinct's

15:48.478 --> 15:50.312
Captain Raymond Holt. Raymond?

15:53.650 --> 15:56.118
Let me begin with a hilarious joke.

15:56.196 --> 15:58.352
I'm surprised I was on the
short list for commissioner.

15:58.671 --> 16:00.557
After all, I am six feet tall.

16:01.869 --> 16:04.871
Actually, what I have to say
tonight is no laughing matter.

16:04.907 --> 16:06.862
I was just told by a member
of the selection committee

16:06.897 --> 16:08.597
that they have no intention

16:08.633 --> 16:11.267
of ever choosing
a woman to run the NYPD.

16:11.493 --> 16:12.757
I suppose I should have been relieved,

16:12.793 --> 16:15.303
because Captain Crawford
is a damn qualified candidate.

16:15.338 --> 16:17.205
But as someone who has
been denied opportunity

16:17.240 --> 16:18.556
because of who I am,

16:19.409 --> 16:21.776
I cannot stand by and watch
it happen to someone else.

16:21.811 --> 16:24.679
So, I will be reserving my presentation

16:24.714 --> 16:27.148
for a selection committee
that will judge

16:27.183 --> 16:28.850
all of the candidates fairly.

16:29.241 --> 16:30.459
And let's be honest.

16:30.992 --> 16:32.575
The crab cakes were only so-so.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.159
Thank you.

16:35.767 --> 16:37.392
All right, talk to me, what's happening?

16:37.427 --> 16:39.928
- What's Sammy up to?
- Well, he just sat down

16:39.963 --> 16:42.097
- on the plaza.
- Okay, he's opening up

16:42.132 --> 16:45.400
his backpack and pulling out
what appears to be a thermos.

16:45.435 --> 16:47.936
Possibly containing some sort
of accelerant-like gasoline.

16:47.971 --> 16:49.704
- Yup.
- No, he's eating it

16:49.739 --> 16:51.606
with a spoon.
It's soup, he's eating soup.

16:51.641 --> 16:54.479
Well, maybe he's fueling up
for a night of starting fires.

16:54.515 --> 16:55.910
He just pulled out a lighter!

16:55.946 --> 16:58.587
Nope, it's not a lighter.
It's a bumblebee PEZ dispenser.

16:58.623 --> 17:00.318
- Hmm.
- Ooh, he's making a phone call.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.516
Quick, get the parabolic mic.

17:01.551 --> 17:04.419
<i>Mom, I did something bad.</i>

17:04.454 --> 17:06.288
Yeah, you set some fires.

17:06.323 --> 17:08.757
<i>I proposed to Gretchen, and she said no.</i>

17:08.791 --> 17:12.141
- So you set some fires.
<i>- So, I left Myrtle Beach.</i>

17:12.176 --> 17:13.911
Two weeks ago,
and then you set some fires.

17:13.946 --> 17:15.473
<i>No, I got back home today.</i>

17:16.085 --> 17:18.073
<i>Yeah, all my fish were dead.</i>

17:18.108 --> 17:19.405
Okay, so Sam didn't do it.

17:19.441 --> 17:20.996
I should probably get back to my corner.

17:21.031 --> 17:22.060
Just for the record,

17:22.097 --> 17:23.371
just because I was wrong about Sam,

17:23.406 --> 17:25.607
does not mean that Vin was right.

17:26.387 --> 17:30.222
Well, this is disappointing.

17:31.611 --> 17:33.463
I can't believe you left your post.

17:33.498 --> 17:34.975
What, the plan wasn't yours,

17:35.011 --> 17:36.444
so you didn't think
it was worth following?

17:36.480 --> 17:38.480
Well, because of your juvenile behavior,

17:38.516 --> 17:40.383
one of our city's finest...

17:40.419 --> 17:43.020
abandoned lard factories
is now burned to the ground.

17:43.056 --> 17:45.190
My gut told me that Sam
Jepson was setting the fires.

17:45.226 --> 17:46.626
Although I now realize his actual life

17:46.662 --> 17:48.462
is much sadder than that
of a serial arsonist.

17:48.498 --> 17:50.231
But we agreed to do Vin's plan.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.050
So what? Vin is not a cop.

17:52.086 --> 17:53.802
Why do you keep siding
with him instead of me?

17:53.838 --> 17:55.284
Oh, let me guess, because he was right,

17:55.320 --> 17:56.620
and the building was on fire,
and he's perfect?

17:56.655 --> 17:58.855
Wait, are you jealous of Vin?

18:00.038 --> 18:01.007
Jake?

18:01.526 --> 18:03.360
All right, I didn't want to say anything

18:03.395 --> 18:05.596
because it's a gross emotion,
but yes, I am a little bit

18:05.631 --> 18:07.606
jealous of the super smart supermodel.

18:08.133 --> 18:09.633
This was our last case together.

18:09.669 --> 18:11.485
And you and him have
been joined at the hip.

18:11.737 --> 18:13.770
Or in his case, that super sexy V muscle

18:13.805 --> 18:15.372
that I don't understand how to tone.

18:15.407 --> 18:17.241
He told me, it's a lot
of bicycle crunches.

18:17.276 --> 18:18.775
Crunches on a bicycle?

18:18.810 --> 18:20.403
That's crazy,
you would just fall right off.

18:20.439 --> 18:23.541
Babe, you have no reason
to be jealous of him.

18:23.577 --> 18:24.964
I just...

18:25.584 --> 18:27.280
I don't want you to wake up one day

18:27.316 --> 18:30.385
and with that you were with
someone as smart as you are.

18:30.556 --> 18:32.489
I am with someone as smart as I am.

18:32.524 --> 18:33.624
You.

18:33.659 --> 18:35.256
You're a brilliant detective.

18:35.292 --> 18:37.126
I love the way you think.

18:37.329 --> 18:39.195
That's why I want to marry you.

18:40.799 --> 18:41.890
Marry me.

18:42.968 --> 18:45.269
Marry. Oh, my God, look.

18:45.304 --> 18:47.537
The arsonist spelled MAR,
but they were going to spell

18:47.572 --> 18:49.597
M-A-R-R-Y! Or...

18:49.908 --> 18:51.441
Conjugate. Conjugate means marry!

18:51.476 --> 18:53.078
Yes, and who wants to marry Vin?

18:53.114 --> 18:54.783
The lady from the bar!

18:55.020 --> 18:57.387
Hey, puzzle chick, unscramble this.

18:57.423 --> 18:59.494
You're going to "ailj."

19:01.445 --> 19:02.878
All right, Sarge. The car is yours.

19:02.913 --> 19:04.680
What? Why?

19:04.715 --> 19:06.848
- I don't deserve that car.
- I don't know about that.

19:06.883 --> 19:09.217
I went back and watched the tapes
to figure out how you did it.

19:09.252 --> 19:10.786
Right before the drawing,

19:10.821 --> 19:12.454
you got a peanut butter cup
out of the freezer.

19:12.489 --> 19:14.389
The thing is, you don't
eat sugar past 4:00 p.m.

19:14.424 --> 19:15.724
Could have been a cheat day.

19:15.759 --> 19:17.212
Oh, it was definitely a cheat day.

19:17.248 --> 19:18.593
You froze your slip of paper,

19:18.628 --> 19:19.995
so that when you pulled the name,

19:20.030 --> 19:21.797
all you had to do was find the cold one.

19:21.832 --> 19:22.932
So.

19:23.192 --> 19:24.608
You thought the way I cheated

19:24.643 --> 19:26.335
was so cool, you gave me the car?

19:26.370 --> 19:27.903
Yeah, but also while
I was watching those tapes,

19:27.938 --> 19:29.538
I noticed all the nice crap
you do for people.

19:29.573 --> 19:30.906
You got Gina a cushion for her chair.

19:30.941 --> 19:32.808
You let Charles show you 130 pictures

19:32.843 --> 19:34.409
of Nikolaj brushing his teeth.

19:34.444 --> 19:35.977
You Heimlich'd Scully twice.

19:36.012 --> 19:38.415
- On the same peanut.
- I also solved a murder.

19:38.451 --> 19:40.278
Yeah, we all solve murders, but you,

19:40.984 --> 19:42.918
you let Hitchcock borrow
a pair of your socks,

19:42.953 --> 19:44.463
because his somehow disintegrated.

19:44.499 --> 19:46.299
Anyway, I'm sorry I guilted you
in the first place.

19:46.335 --> 19:48.635
- You deserve that car.
- Thanks, Diaz.

19:48.925 --> 19:51.626
How did you get Hitchcock
and Scully to agree to this?

19:51.661 --> 19:53.562
I washed their car and
told them it was a new one.

19:53.598 --> 19:54.963
They're napping in it right now.

19:54.998 --> 19:56.302
Smart!

19:57.567 --> 20:00.268
- Hello, Captain Holt.
- Ah, Captain Crawford.

20:00.303 --> 20:01.636
To what do I owe the pleasure?

20:01.671 --> 20:03.438
Captain Crawford is here to see you.

20:03.473 --> 20:04.631
Thank you, Gina.

20:05.809 --> 20:08.627
So, it would seem that
we have become frenemies.

20:08.945 --> 20:11.546
- Do you know what that means?
- Are you trying to imply

20:11.581 --> 20:13.348
that I'm too old to
understand a portmanteau?

20:13.383 --> 20:16.952
I am not, but I am
too dignified to use one.

20:16.987 --> 20:18.180
Friend-enemy.

20:18.216 --> 20:20.502
I just wanted to thank you,
for your brave speech.

20:20.538 --> 20:21.810
The mayor's office has replaced

20:21.846 --> 20:24.518
the selection committee
with a less biased one, so.

20:24.861 --> 20:26.828
Feel free to start calling
me commissioner now.

20:26.863 --> 20:28.397
The only time I plan on calling you

20:28.432 --> 20:29.664
is to hear you concede.

20:29.699 --> 20:30.966
It's going to be hard to hear anything

20:31.001 --> 20:32.734
once I've crushed you
into a fine powder.

20:32.769 --> 20:35.230
A fine powder that will
choke you until you die.

20:35.677 --> 20:37.619
May the better candidate win.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.470
She will.

20:42.078 --> 20:43.674
Captain Crawford left.

20:45.081 --> 20:46.415
So, we brought her in this morning,

20:46.450 --> 20:47.883
and she confessed immediately.

20:47.918 --> 20:50.786
Hi, Vin, I love you!
Did you see my fires?

20:50.821 --> 20:52.387
Turned out, she was writing something.

20:52.422 --> 20:55.657
Specifically, "marry me,
or else I will kill you.

20:55.692 --> 20:57.325
Yours forever, Helen Gorbelson."

20:57.360 --> 21:00.061
- Wow, that's so many fires.
- So many fires.

21:00.096 --> 21:02.597
Thank you for catching her.
With a brilliant puzzling mind

21:02.632 --> 21:04.499
like yours on the case,
it was only a matter of time.

21:04.534 --> 21:05.901
Actually, Jake solved it.

21:06.301 --> 21:07.738
He's kind of a genius with this stuff.

21:07.774 --> 21:08.936
Oh, thank you, then.

21:08.972 --> 21:09.983
Couldn't have done it without your help.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.266
So I guess that's that.

21:11.302 --> 21:12.507
I should probably run
if I'm going to make it

21:12.542 --> 21:14.239
to the Javits Center by four.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.306
They're making a mold of me for
the upcoming Bodies Exhibit.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.743
As they should, your body is great.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.445
- And that's okay.
- Thanks, man.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.050
You should join me
for a puzzle night sometime.

21:22.085 --> 21:23.339
- Oh.
- No!

21:23.550 --> 21:25.487
Jake is taken. He already has a friend.

21:25.522 --> 21:27.055
Hang out offer declined.

21:27.090 --> 21:28.890
Now let's strut your
centerfold ass out of here.
