WEBVTT

00:00.584 --> 00:02.794
- Who are you talking about?
- He's in a coma, David!

00:03.170 --> 00:05.589
- Who?
- Justin, Ricci.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.593
You, you signed that boy's
death sentence.

00:10.469 --> 00:13.597
His chances of recovering from
blast crisis is zero, David.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.974
Do you refuse the chance,
no matter how small, how remote,

00:16.099 --> 00:16.975
to save a child's life?

00:17.976 --> 00:20.062
Say nothing, nothing happens.

00:22.564 --> 00:27.194
These people, Carlos, they're HIV-positive
and they never get AIDS.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.488
You can save me.

00:30.072 --> 00:32.281
How are you going to smuggle
the stem cells into the States?

00:32.573 --> 00:34.576
You're going to hide them in a
tub of butter brickle ice cream?

00:34.660 --> 00:37.287
We send them the way we send
all NorBAC samples.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.164
What the fuck is going
on here Carlos?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.375
Lloyd was my first lover.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.170
Mick, maybe this wasn't a
great idea. I--

00:45.671 --> 00:48.674
It is. It is! It's an amazing idea.

00:49.675 --> 00:52.386
It this whole whale-watching
thing just some ploy

00:52.761 --> 00:54.263
to get me in a motel room with you?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.098
Yeah, that's why I caused the blackout too.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.397
You don't understand, this is
a government operated lab I'm in now.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.400
And the paperwork.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.279
Thank you Robert.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.698
Thank you Miss Richmond.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.576
Look, I think I see a whale!
Seriously! Look, look!

01:15.784 --> 01:16.994
Mick, do you see it?

01:18.996 --> 01:19.663
Mick?

01:22.374 --> 01:23.166
Mick?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.168
Mick? Mick?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.390
1x08- Blackout

03:06.979 --> 03:08.689
Solar storms, Bob?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.191
Sure, on account of the
weather, the... in space I mean,

03:11.400 --> 03:13.277
the electrical activity brought
on by solar storms.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.863
It's attracted to our power grids, so...

03:16.071 --> 03:17.281
And how is it going to cause an explosion

03:17.281 --> 03:19.867
in underground cables,
resulting in a blackout?

03:20.701 --> 03:21.702
Well... I'm not...

03:28.876 --> 03:30.586
Can I help you gentlemen?

03:30.586 --> 03:32.671
I don't know, what you got in mind?

03:33.172 --> 03:35.174
Gideon Voss, Homeland Security.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.885
Okay, Voss is here, over.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.679
- We're with NorBAC.
- Can I see your I.D.?

03:40.888 --> 03:41.889
- In the car.
- Where's your car?

03:42.097 --> 03:42.890
In Toronto.
Where's Toronto?

03:43.098 --> 03:46.185
I can confirm that this is
Chief Scientist David Sandstrom,

03:46.602 --> 03:49.479
from the North American
Biotechnology Advisory Committee.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.691
So what are you digging around here for?
The explosion was by the river.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.194
Yeah. What would we do without you!

03:55.485 --> 03:58.989
Figured you boys didn't know your ass
from a hole in the ground. This way.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.491
Watch your step.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.702
They're still finding pieces
of that security guard.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.872
CIA thinks it's terrorism.

04:06.872 --> 04:07.998
No, really?

04:08.290 --> 04:11.168
Thought you'd said there was
no evidence of an explosive device.

04:11.502 --> 04:14.087
FBI says it's an industrial accident
at a substation

04:14.463 --> 04:16.589
and ATF says it's a natural occurrence.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.801
- Guess you're the tiebreaker.
- Oh, that's why we're here!

04:25.474 --> 04:27.100
You do this by telepathy?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.482
- What you got there, Bob?
- Burnt wire, I guess.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.983
Genius, boy!

04:35.567 --> 04:37.277
Actually, Bob, you are a
genius, aren't you?

04:37.569 --> 04:39.196
- What's your I.Q. again?
- 162.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.490
Wow! What about you Gid?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.784
You boys deal with issues of
great importance, don't you?

04:44.368 --> 04:46.787
Like finding the blood of Christ
on a 2000-year-old nail?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.080
Tell you what Gid,

04:48.163 --> 04:50.791
you don't mention the nail,
I won't mention Waco.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.877
First of all, that was ATF.
Secondly, it's Inspector Voss.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.381
Whatever! You want to keep taking shots
or do you want to answer a few questions.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.385
You said 3 labs were here,
did anyone find anything?

05:01.468 --> 05:02.094
Nothing.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.096
What about explosive residue?

05:04.179 --> 05:06.598
No. CIA thinks the terrorists used
solid nitrogen,

05:06.974 --> 05:09.601
rocket fuel, N5+N5-, leaves no residue.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.563
- Everything leaves some residue.
- What about the folks who run the plant?

05:13.063 --> 05:15.190
Not a clue. No gas leak, no short circuits.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.568
- How old is the cable?
- Brand spanking.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.280
So there's no chance the wire
could be degraded, sparking explosion.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.283
I hope you're going
to think of a better one than that.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.369
Have they been doing any
digging around here?

05:27.703 --> 05:30.289
A couple weeks ago,
about 50 yards in that direction.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.292
Electric crew was doing some
repairs on a secondary line.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.381
All right Bob, we're going to need
soil samples...

05:39.381 --> 05:40.465
from everywhere.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.302
We have to find something
everyone else missed.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.096
Shouldn't be too hard. Yeah?

05:46.597 --> 05:47.973
Oh, hey Lil'!

05:48.473 --> 05:51.268
How the great whale hunt going?
You see any huntybacks yet?

05:52.477 --> 05:53.478
Lilith?

05:53.562 --> 05:54.563
Dad...

05:56.899 --> 05:58.567
Lilith, what's wrong?

05:58.901 --> 05:59.776
Dad...

06:02.487 --> 06:03.363
he died.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.783
Where are you? I'll be right there.

06:13.665 --> 06:18.378
/* The past is never past */

06:18.879 --> 06:24.301
/* Just razor dew in a glass */

06:24.885 --> 06:29.765
/* Of hours and sand
in the old man's hand */

06:30.182 --> 06:34.603
/* The past is never past */

06:35.103 --> 06:39.483
/* Take me over */

06:40.400 --> 06:44.863
/* Take me over and again */

06:45.697 --> 06:49.993
/* Take me over */

06:51.203 --> 06:55.874
/* Take me over and again */

06:58.293 --> 07:00.087
"Millions remain without power

07:00.087 --> 07:01.797
from Northern Ontario to Virginia."

07:03.090 --> 07:06.885
Lily, you look a little tired, you sure
you don't want me to get you a glass of milk?

07:10.597 --> 07:12.391
Hey, I thought we'd order in tonight.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.394
You know that little Korean place you like?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.564
"Lines are lighting up
as we take your calls.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.482
"We want your stories, anecdotes--"

07:20.899 --> 07:23.777
Yeah, it's the same
on every station. Jeez.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.488
I got to lie down.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.001
I'm not really that inconvenienced.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.670
Ugh, I've no alarm clock,
no hair dryer, no microwave.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.881
Couldn't recharge my cell phone.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.091
Those aren't really inconveniences, Mayko.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.385
Oh no? Well, what is
an inconvenience, Bob?

07:48.677 --> 07:51.972
Well, I suppose if you were in an iron lung
or needed electro-defibrillation.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.099
You know who's really happy
about this blackout?

07:54.099 --> 07:54.975
Who?

07:55.392 --> 07:58.187
That guy on death row who was
supposed to get the chair this morning.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.771
That's not funny.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.775
Oh-oh, blackout, remember?

08:06.570 --> 08:09.781
So, underground wires
seemingly spontaneously combust.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.868
The paranoid amongst us assume
that it's terrorism.

08:13.202 --> 08:14.995
My guess is they haven't got a
clue and have asked us

08:15.204 --> 08:17.789
to figure out the what, the how,
the why that it all happened.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.666
Why do they think it's terrorism?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.877
I don't know, because that's
what you do these days.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.379
But, didn't you say there's no
explosive residue?

08:24.671 --> 08:25.088
Bob.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.300
Modern Science had a piece on
the Belgian military trying to use bacteria

08:28.383 --> 08:30.677
to eat TNT and other explosives.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.179
Maybe we should be looking for bacteria.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.974
Okay, Bob's got the assignments,
he'll delegate. Anything else?

08:36.265 --> 08:40.479
Yes, a Miranda virus update:
the Garcinia kola works on Ebola

08:40.895 --> 08:43.398
but has no effect on Camelpox
Ebola chimera.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.776
- Why not?
- I don't know.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.070
If it didn't seem like
I was making a bad joke,

08:48.487 --> 08:50.989
I would say
that we're in the dark here.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.575
- What are you using as a host?
- Mice.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.494
See, you'd need something like a camel.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.578
How about a yak?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.164
- Yak's not a camel.
- Well, he said like a camel.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.167
- It's not like a camel either.
- Problem is, there's nothing like a camel.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.170
- Except a vicuna.
- A wh-who-na?

09:06.004 --> 09:10.300
A vicuna. It's like a guanaco,
only smaller and it chews its cud.

09:10.801 --> 09:11.885
- Oh.
- I think.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.470
Let's get to work.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.894
Hey, how's your friend doing?

09:21.270 --> 09:22.271
Good.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.898
He seems to be responding to treatment.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.692
Thanks for asking.

09:28.986 --> 09:32.197
I just got a call. CIA got intercepts
of a plan to create a blackout

09:32.489 --> 09:35.367
and use the chaos to move terrorists
from Canada to the U.S.

09:35.701 --> 09:36.702
Right, blame Canada!

09:36.869 --> 09:38.704
They'd like a preliminary
answer by tomorrow.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.205
We get a day and a half,

09:40.581 --> 09:43.500
when the combined forces of
Homeland Security, ATF, FBI and CIA

09:43.500 --> 09:45.878
are still scratching
their dopey little heads.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.880
That's why you get the big bucks.

10:32.591 --> 10:33.884
- Jill?
- Hmm?

10:34.593 --> 10:35.677
Would you mind?

10:39.264 --> 10:40.182
What's up?

10:42.100 --> 10:44.478
Oh, hello little bacteria.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.273
Okay, so we've got
filamentous objects, bacteria.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.399
Every wire's crawling with them.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.276
So is every inch of our body, Bob.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.403
- Maybe one is a dynamite-eating one.
- Maybe.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.198
There's breeding underground,
but there's no oxygen,

10:56.281 --> 10:57.991
so there's a good chance
they're anaerobic.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.577
Yeah, but not all underground
bacteria are anaerobic.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.205
We'll probably have to grow some
with air and some without, to be sure.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.874
And then we'll have to test
every known explosive

11:05.874 --> 11:07.668
and try and figure out what kind they eat.

11:08.293 --> 11:12.506
Except, if the soil is anaerobic, then,
where's the oxygen that fuels the explosion?

11:18.470 --> 11:19.388
Oh, Bob?

11:19.805 --> 11:23.600
Didn't Voss say there was some digging
near where the explosion occurred?

11:23.684 --> 11:24.393
Who?

11:24.893 --> 11:26.478
Oh! Yeah, he did.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.897
There's your oxygen source.

11:28.897 --> 11:29.565
Kaboom !

11:31.066 --> 11:31.567
Boom!

12:21.283 --> 12:22.701
Fuck! Litith! Lilith?

12:23.702 --> 12:26.705
You wake up, come on, wake up!
How many did you take?

12:26.997 --> 12:28.582
Pills! How many pills did you take?

12:28.582 --> 12:29.166
One.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.876
Don't bullshit me! How many?

12:30.876 --> 12:31.668
Maybe two.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.795
The bottle was half-full, Lilith!

12:33.795 --> 12:35.088
Dad, I only took two.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.174
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- I'm not lying!

12:37.174 --> 12:38.467
The bottle spilled.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.302
Spilled?

12:41.970 --> 12:44.806
It spilled when I took the bottle.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.476
I shouldn't be took the pills.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.478
I'm so tired. Pills.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.482
So tired and I wanted to sleep.

12:54.191 --> 12:54.566
Okay, okay.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.903
And I fell asleep because
I keep seeing these fucking...

12:58.987 --> 13:00.280
Come here. Come here.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.491
Come here...

13:52.666 --> 13:54.001
Hey, Sarah, it's me.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.004
She's fine, sort of.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.799
Hmm, a friend of hers died

14:01.383 --> 14:02.676
and she's...

14:02.968 --> 14:05.095
No, no, no, no, natural causes. But...

14:05.888 --> 14:08.182
You can't, she's sleeping
right now. And I...

14:08.807 --> 14:10.976
Would you just calm down for one...

14:11.685 --> 14:14.271
second please and let me finish?

14:15.689 --> 14:16.773
Thank you.

14:18.066 --> 14:18.984
I...

14:21.987 --> 14:24.406
I'm no good at this. I can't...

14:26.867 --> 14:28.493
I don't...

14:31.997 --> 14:35.000
She really needs you out
here right now, okay?

14:38.086 --> 14:40.172
And I could really use your help.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.092
Thank you.

14:58.607 --> 14:59.608
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:01.193 --> 15:02.569
You wanted to see me?

15:03.195 --> 15:05.197
Yeah, yeah, come in.
Close the door, would you?

15:20.379 --> 15:23.382
I need you to
do something for me.

15:24.007 --> 15:24.883
Okay.

15:25.676 --> 15:27.302
I need you to...

15:28.303 --> 15:29.805
I need you to...

15:32.975 --> 15:36.687
A few mornings ago,
in the shower, I felt...

15:37.104 --> 15:39.273
My appointment with my doctor
was cancelled. The blackout.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.899
And I was thinking, you're a doctor.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.901
- Caroline, if you felt something--
- Maybe something!

15:43.068 --> 15:45.904
- Whatever! You need to have a mammogram.
- Maybe it's nothing. Can't you just--

15:46.071 --> 15:47.573
No, you still need a mammogram.

15:49.074 --> 15:52.494
My mother had breast cancer at 41.

15:53.579 --> 15:54.872
And at 41, she died.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.793
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:07.593 --> 16:08.385
Anything?

16:09.386 --> 16:11.305
60 plates and they haven't eaten a thing.

16:12.306 --> 16:14.474
I'm growing the boys on every
known anaerobic medium,

16:14.975 --> 16:17.477
given them a buffet of every
explosive known to man.

16:17.769 --> 16:18.604
Boys?

16:18.896 --> 16:21.190
The Bacteria Street Boys.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.275
That's cute, Bob.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.278
I can't get them to eat any of
the explosive residue.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.907
Listen, I'm going to pack it in for tonight.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.993
Sorry. Too much caffeine.

16:33.285 --> 16:35.579
No, no, I'm sorry.
Get some sleep.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.601
Sarah, no, don't put me on... Yeah?

16:57.893 --> 16:59.895
- Should I come back?
- Yes. No, what is it?

17:00.187 --> 17:02.189
Come in. I'm on hold with my ex.

17:02.481 --> 17:04.775
I need an update
on the blackout investigation.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.902
- I'm working on it.
- If it is terrorism...

17:07.194 --> 17:09.695
- Don't jump to conclusions.
- Then give me something.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.782
Yeah, hello, hi! Yes...

17:13.492 --> 17:13.909
no.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.371
Sure, call me back.

17:17.371 --> 17:20.707
I'll just sit here all day, waiting.

17:22.501 --> 17:25.002
If the Americans
want to blame the blackout

17:25.002 --> 17:26.797
on a bunch of faceless Arabs,

17:26.880 --> 17:28.507
they can do it without my complicity.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.884
Oh, who's jumping to conclusions now?

17:31.093 --> 17:32.886
So you're assuming faceless terrorists

17:32.886 --> 17:34.471
- had nothing to do with it?
- No.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.473
A tape aired on Al-Jazeera
this morning.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.976
Al Gamahad is taking credit for the blackout

17:39.184 --> 17:40.894
and threatening more across the continent.

17:42.771 --> 17:43.897
Well, taking credit

17:43.897 --> 17:45.691
and deserving it
are two different things.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.402
You work in enough offices,
you find that out.

17:52.698 --> 17:53.490
Good morning.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.284
Good morning, Bob. Any luck?

17:55.492 --> 17:56.201
With?

17:56.368 --> 17:58.704
The Bacteria Street Boys.

17:58.704 --> 17:59.872
Oh! No, nothing.

18:18.182 --> 18:21.476
The landfill, which is unmarked,
is located 2 miles upstream.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.103
- Beneath the subdivision?
- Correct.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.771
Ah, life in the 'burbs!

18:25.105 --> 18:27.608
So your theory could be right, then?
Combined with the oxygen source?

18:27.900 --> 18:29.985
So maybe the bacteria are
eating pollution, not explosives

18:30.485 --> 18:32.279
and produce, say, methane,
which gets blown up.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.073
None of this explains why
we can't grow it.

18:35.574 --> 18:36.909
No, but this might. Bob,

18:36.909 --> 18:39.995
do you remember a smell like rotten eggs
when we were in Buffalo?

18:40.996 --> 18:41.580
Bob?

18:41.997 --> 18:43.707
Huh? Eggs?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.375
No, I brought gravlax.

18:45.584 --> 18:46.710
- What?
- For lunch.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.297
Good, Bob!
Thanks for paying attention.

18:50.589 --> 18:53.008
Says here a worker at the plant,
responding to the explosion

18:53.300 --> 18:55.969
noted a smell like "rotten eggs", so.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.180
We could be dealing with a
bacterium here,

18:58.597 --> 19:00.307
that is sucking in hydrogen sulphate

19:00.307 --> 19:01.600
and farting out sulphide.

19:01.892 --> 19:03.101
Which would explode.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.270
Now, all we have to do is figure out

19:05.270 --> 19:06.605
what the hell that bacterium is.

19:06.897 --> 19:09.775
- Question: How do we find out?
- Answer: Fluorescent DNA probes.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.485
- Which are?
- Smart bombs.

19:11.902 --> 19:14.196
We tell them what to hunt for,
they not only find them, they light them up.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.698
And we program these probes
to look for what, Bob?

19:16.990 --> 19:19.576
- Sulphate reducers.
- Good Bob, you are paying attention.

19:19.701 --> 19:20.202
Let's do it!

19:21.703 --> 19:22.788
David.

19:23.372 --> 19:24.373
The Times wants an interview.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.374
- London?
- Nope.

19:25.707 --> 19:26.291
Fuck!

19:28.293 --> 19:29.795
- Hello?
- Hey, did you eat yet?

19:30.295 --> 19:31.380
I'm not hungry.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.006
Did you hear that?

19:33.006 --> 19:35.300
It set off the David Sandstrom
lie detector.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.678
Dad, don't do Carney.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.973
Come on, truth is I'm desperate
to have lunch with you.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.975
Why?

19:43.392 --> 19:44.893
Because I'm feeling spontaneous

19:44.977 --> 19:47.896
and if I don't act on my whims now,
when will I?

19:48.981 --> 19:51.900
Is this David Sandstrom, my father?

19:52.401 --> 19:55.696
You know, that guy who never
leaves his lab unless it's for a drink?

19:55.904 --> 19:58.282
Okay, that's... that's way
beyond your years.

19:59.283 --> 20:02.494
Come on, Lil! Have lunch with me! Food?

20:02.995 --> 20:06.582
Won't say a word, we'll just sit there
like an old married couple,

20:06.790 --> 20:09.793
- happy in our silence.
- The Lazy Flamingo then?

20:10.586 --> 20:11.378
My God, that's canny!

20:11.378 --> 20:13.380
Will you be out of your PJs by 1?

20:13.672 --> 20:14.798
I'll try.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.397
You didn't tell her.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.776
I didn't want her to think
we were worried.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.195
David.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.698
Hey, kiddo!

20:39.698 --> 20:40.574
How are you?

20:42.284 --> 20:44.286
- What are you doing here?
- It's so good to see you!

20:44.870 --> 20:46.079
How come you're in Toronto?

20:46.580 --> 20:48.290
My God, you look so grown-up!

20:53.086 --> 20:54.171
Sorry, I have to...

20:54.588 --> 20:56.298
Morris, did he sign?

20:58.008 --> 21:00.010
No, look, skip the details
and tell me: Did he sign?

21:01.011 --> 21:03.180
- That's not acceptable.
- Dad, what's going on?

21:03.597 --> 21:05.182
It won't work, Morris!

21:06.683 --> 21:08.393
Well, then you can tell him
we're going to release

21:08.477 --> 21:10.187
his Greatest Hits package
with his ugliest picture.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.271
I'm sorry, are we interrupting
your business?

21:12.606 --> 21:14.191
If it's not important,
I won't take it.

21:14.608 --> 21:16.693
Oh really? Lilith,
call your mom, see if she takes it.

21:16.985 --> 21:17.778
- Off.
- Thank you.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.700
Everything okay?

21:26.578 --> 21:28.997
Yeah. How about you?

21:29.873 --> 21:31.083
- Good.
- Good, yeah?

21:31.375 --> 21:32.501
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great! Dad?

21:33.085 --> 21:34.002
Never better.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.297
Great. Everything's just so great...

21:39.508 --> 21:41.510
Your father told me about
your friend Nick.

21:46.974 --> 21:47.975
It's Mick.

21:54.606 --> 21:55.899
Why don't we order?

21:55.899 --> 21:57.776
Guys, what do I feel like?

22:04.074 --> 22:05.200
Hi.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.705
- This is cozy.
- Yeah.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.210
Ah, that's something!

22:15.210 --> 22:16.712
That's really something.

22:17.671 --> 22:19.882
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Oh yeah!

22:20.382 --> 22:21.175
It's kinda...

22:22.301 --> 22:24.011
beautiful, yeah, like you said.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.307
This reminds me
of watching a movie.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.809
Because of the
lights and everything.

22:31.101 --> 22:32.477
Yeah, I know, I know, I get it.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.771
Yeah, I guess all we need
now is popcorn.

22:35.189 --> 22:36.106
Yeah, ha, ha.

22:36.773 --> 22:37.774
Popcorn!

22:39.985 --> 22:41.778
Do I... Did you... D-

22:42.779 --> 22:44.072
Do you ever go?

22:44.907 --> 22:45.699
Go where?

22:46.283 --> 22:47.075
Movies.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.703
Because I like to go...

22:50.579 --> 22:52.581
so you know, maybe we could go...

22:53.582 --> 22:55.709
you know? Sometime?

22:57.586 --> 22:58.795
Ah...

23:00.297 --> 23:01.298
Huh.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.594
Well, it looks like

23:06.595 --> 23:08.597
we found our sulphate
reducers all right.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.098
- I'll just write it up.
- Bob? Please.

23:13.602 --> 23:16.980
Look, you are such a special guy.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.275
It's just... I don't date guys
that I work with.

23:20.776 --> 23:23.278
So, if David asked you out, would you...

23:25.280 --> 23:27.199
would the same rule apply to David, too?

23:27.699 --> 23:28.283
Yes.

23:31.787 --> 23:32.704
Okay.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.708
I'm sorry, Bob.

23:43.882 --> 23:44.675
Lilith,

23:46.009 --> 23:47.302
you came out here to...

23:49.471 --> 23:52.307
to get a fresh start, right?

23:52.975 --> 23:55.102
Isn't that what you wrote
in your e-mail?

23:55.686 --> 23:57.187
Okay, you're 15 now,

23:57.396 --> 23:58.981
I don't know why a 15-year-old kid

23:59.106 --> 24:00.399
needs a fresh start,

24:00.482 --> 24:01.275
but I let you go.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.695
Knowing quite frankly that
this day would come and here it is.

24:05.988 --> 24:06.697
Right.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.283
And you think this is the answer?

24:10.701 --> 24:12.995
Just go back to all those stupid teachers

24:13.495 --> 24:16.498
and all those stupid friends?
None of it matters.

24:16.707 --> 24:19.877
- What matters Lil?
- I saw him die, mom!

24:24.006 --> 24:26.383
- I held him.
- I'm sorry.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.888
And then they came and
they took him.

24:32.181 --> 24:34.892
- Now he's gone.
- I know it's hard.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.898
It really hurts, mom.

24:41.106 --> 24:43.108
Sure it does, but it will get better.

24:44.193 --> 24:47.696
You'll see. You'll come home
and you won't be alone all the time,

24:47.905 --> 24:48.989
and things will be better,

24:49.573 --> 24:50.991
I promise.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.207
There!

24:59.791 --> 25:01.502
It's okay.

25:04.379 --> 25:06.089
It's okay.

25:10.177 --> 25:12.179
Hey, Bob. How's it going with that probe?

25:12.179 --> 25:14.389
Yes, good. I was just writing it up.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.601
I'm standing right here Bob, just tell me.

25:18.185 --> 25:19.895
Yeah, well, it worked like you said.

25:20.187 --> 25:21.980
Just zeroed in, just lit right up,

25:21.980 --> 25:23.607
like a fireworks display, a Chinese one.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.693
Good, okay. So what you're telling me is
that we've narrowed the search?

25:26.902 --> 25:27.611
Huge narrowing.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.781
So I thought that
we should isolate things further...

25:33.700 --> 25:34.993
...cell sorter.

25:35.410 --> 25:35.911
Good!

25:37.704 --> 25:38.872
- David?
- Hmm?

25:38.997 --> 25:40.082
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.000
It's...

25:46.505 --> 25:48.507
I got a call today from Camico Cosmetics.

25:49.091 --> 25:50.509
Miss Richmond, over there asked--

25:50.676 --> 25:52.094
We'll talk about this later, Bob.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.179
David! Ann Katzman, from the Times.

25:54.388 --> 25:56.181
Oh! Hey, thanks for coming!

25:56.890 --> 25:58.809
Why don't we do this in your office?

26:02.187 --> 26:03.605
Oh, hey Carlos, I need you to run PCR

26:03.689 --> 26:05.691
on fatty-acid mass spec on the MSG.

26:06.108 --> 26:07.901
Ah... you want the geno-type
or gina-type?

26:08.277 --> 26:09.903
- Both!
- Right on it, boss!

26:10.195 --> 26:10.779
Thank you!

26:12.698 --> 26:14.783
So, you want it in science, or
you want it in English?

26:15.200 --> 26:17.578
You know what, this isn't my usual beat,
so, English, maybe.

26:17.995 --> 26:20.789
What did they do? Take you off
Fashion or Arts and Leisure?

26:21.707 --> 26:23.584
I usually cover international economics

26:23.584 --> 26:24.877
and labour trends.

26:25.586 --> 26:26.295
Okay.

26:27.296 --> 26:30.591
So, Dr. Sandstrom,
how accurate is NorBAC's claim

26:30.674 --> 26:32.676
that these blackouts are due
to a hydrogen sulphite

26:32.885 --> 26:34.386
build-up from bacteria in the soil

26:34.595 --> 26:35.888
around the substation?

26:36.305 --> 26:37.973
Wow! Completely premature.

26:38.974 --> 26:40.809
That comes from Congresswoman Schuyler.

26:41.185 --> 26:43.187
Yeah, well, Congress-person-woman Schuyler

26:43.187 --> 26:44.980
is the Chair of the entire NorBAC organization,

26:45.105 --> 26:46.481
so what does she know?

26:47.274 --> 26:48.483
Well, there are other intelligence agencies

26:48.692 --> 26:50.485
that say we are dealing with
an act of bio-terrorism.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.989
If you want to know what
caused the explosion, you came too soon.

26:54.573 --> 26:56.700
Something I don't have
a personal problem with.

26:58.994 --> 27:00.913
Is there anything you don't
want to tell me?

27:01.288 --> 27:02.289
Fire away.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.208
Are we dealing with
an act of bio-terrorism?

27:04.374 --> 27:07.377
Hmm, see? That's the same question,
only kind of different.

27:07.503 --> 27:10.005
Miss Katzman, I think you'd
better redirect your line of questioning.

27:10.214 --> 27:11.215
Thank you, Your Honour.

27:11.381 --> 27:13.383
Could we be dealing with an
act of bio-terrorism?

27:14.009 --> 27:18.514
Finding a used condom in your cream of
oyster soup could be an act of terrorism.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.807
Any fucking thing could be
an act of terrorism,

27:20.974 --> 27:23.310
but until we find all the
evidence, we can't say that.

27:23.477 --> 27:24.686
But you're looking at it as a possibility?

27:24.895 --> 27:27.606
Of course, we are. We wouldn't be doing
our jobs if we didn't look at all the angles,

27:27.898 --> 27:29.691
especially in the light of
all these intercepts flying all over the--

27:29.900 --> 27:30.776
Wait! What intercepts?

27:30.984 --> 27:33.695
She didn't tell you about the intercepts?
All this Goddamned CIA chatter bullshit?

27:33.779 --> 27:34.905
That's it! Interview's over.

27:35.113 --> 27:37.699
Why? That's where this whole
terrorism thing started in the first place.

27:37.908 --> 27:39.785
- Do you have any science questions?
- Wait! Are you telling--

27:39.993 --> 27:41.078
It's over!

27:41.286 --> 27:43.914
NorBAC Director abruptly ends interview.

27:57.177 --> 27:58.011
Hey!

28:08.105 --> 28:09.815
Thought you gave that up.

28:10.274 --> 28:11.108
I did!

28:12.901 --> 28:15.696
This is to help me get through us.

28:16.405 --> 28:17.114
Nice!

28:22.286 --> 28:24.288
You always come home so late?

28:24.913 --> 28:27.791
- You don't remember?
- Oh, I remember you not coming home.

28:29.793 --> 28:33.213
You know, I'm surprised you didn't ship
her back Purolator the moment she got here.

28:33.380 --> 28:36.592
Well, at least it's better then micromanaging
her every move, her every thought...

28:36.800 --> 28:38.302
- You don't manage her at all!
- Here we go!

28:38.886 --> 28:40.888
Will you 2 just both fucking stop it?

28:42.097 --> 28:43.974
Seriously, it's like I'm not even here,

28:44.308 --> 28:46.977
and you're using me
to tear each other apart.

28:47.603 --> 28:48.812
Actually, you know what?

28:48.812 --> 28:50.105
You guys go ahead, okay?

28:50.898 --> 28:52.608
But leave me out of it.

28:53.609 --> 28:55.986
Look, I just lost my friend.

28:55.986 --> 28:57.404
My best friend!

28:59.114 --> 29:01.783
All you care about is putting
each other down.

29:02.201 --> 29:02.784
Lilith!

29:30.604 --> 29:32.397
You know, the first night of the blackout

29:32.397 --> 29:33.690
was kind of cool.

29:34.775 --> 29:36.610
All that darkness and silence.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.613
Sky full of stars.

29:43.408 --> 29:46.203
Ah, this city boy needs some lights,
you know?

29:46.411 --> 29:47.287
Noise.

29:49.498 --> 29:51.500
And I never did know my Ursa Major

29:51.708 --> 29:53.377
from my Ursa Minor, so.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.600
I'm sorry I didn't ask you
more about Mick.

30:10.686 --> 30:12.104
It's okay, dad.

30:12.312 --> 30:13.105
No, it's not.

30:16.984 --> 30:20.696
I'm pretty fucking hopeless when
it comes to this stuff and I just...

30:21.905 --> 30:23.490
I didn't know what to say

30:24.908 --> 30:28.203
and now I'm looking at you take
all this on yourself

30:29.079 --> 30:30.581
and I don't know why.

30:34.209 --> 30:36.503
Because it wasn't your fault, you know.

30:38.797 --> 30:40.799
You did more for Mick than...

30:40.799 --> 30:42.009
anyone.

30:43.802 --> 30:46.096
He met you and,

30:47.014 --> 30:50.309
you know, maybe for the first time
in his life,

30:51.310 --> 30:53.103
somebody, you,

30:54.396 --> 30:57.316
made him feel like he belonged.

30:59.276 --> 31:00.485
You know?

31:03.989 --> 31:05.282
Yeah.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.285
Maybe that's...

31:10.495 --> 31:13.081
Maybe that's how he made you feel too.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.710
It doesn't mean much.

31:17.794 --> 31:20.506
It means he didn't die alone.

31:22.508 --> 31:24.801
I'd say that's pretty huge.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.392
Oh!

31:34.311 --> 31:36.313
Okay, okay!

31:37.898 --> 31:39.107
Okay.

31:44.905 --> 31:46.281
Listen.

31:49.284 --> 31:51.703
You have got to turn all this

31:51.703 --> 31:53.497
into a good memory...

31:55.499 --> 31:58.585
but you're not going to be able
to do that here.

32:00.587 --> 32:03.215
You need to be in a place
that you know,

32:03.799 --> 32:05.801
with people that you know.

32:07.511 --> 32:09.680
And with a mom that you know.

32:12.391 --> 32:14.184
Even if she is fucking nuts!

32:15.102 --> 32:16.603
- Dad.
- I'm sorry.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.610
You know that I love you, right?

32:30.784 --> 32:32.202
I love you too, dad.

32:35.205 --> 32:36.081
Okay.

32:53.098 --> 32:54.391
Come on you should be happy.

32:54.391 --> 32:56.185
Power's back up just about everywhere.

32:56.602 --> 32:57.978
Did you read her piece in the Times?

32:57.978 --> 32:59.313
I never read my reviews.

32:59.605 --> 33:01.190
I had a 4-star General on the phone

33:01.190 --> 33:03.692
screaming at me
about intelligence leaks.

33:03.901 --> 33:05.485
Do I really have blue eyes?

33:05.485 --> 33:07.279
Look, I'm getting it from all sides.

33:07.404 --> 33:09.990
People need to know if this was
an accident, terrorists--

33:10.199 --> 33:12.117
I'm not the one who told you
to feed it to the bear.

33:12.284 --> 33:13.285
It's your theory!

33:13.285 --> 33:15.204
And bullshit until proven.
I told that to Katzman!

33:15.204 --> 33:16.205
She wrote what she wanted.

33:16.580 --> 33:17.998
There are soldiers
stationed at substations,

33:18.415 --> 33:20.709
factories afraid to start up
in case they lose power.

33:20.918 --> 33:22.377
Do you know what that's costing?

33:24.004 --> 33:25.714
- Shit!
- Oh, way to go!

33:43.398 --> 33:45.817
I'm glad we could get together, Robert.

33:47.611 --> 33:49.196
I'm sorry, it's taken me a while.

33:49.488 --> 33:51.198
- Busy?
- Yes, very.

33:52.616 --> 33:54.785
Robert, do you know how talented you are?

33:55.285 --> 33:56.995
No, I'm not...

33:57.913 --> 34:00.415
In my many years in the
cosmetics industry,

34:00.415 --> 34:03.085
I've never known anyone with
your gift for scents.

34:03.877 --> 34:04.503
Thank you.

34:05.712 --> 34:08.005
I told my market researchers your idea

34:08.005 --> 34:09.882
for a line of ancient perfumes.

34:10.509 --> 34:11.301
They loved it.

34:11.510 --> 34:14.179
They're all very anxious to meet you.

34:14.804 --> 34:16.514
I don't know what to say.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.308
Yes, Robert, just say yes.

34:19.393 --> 34:21.687
Come work for me, Robert.

34:21.687 --> 34:23.605
You have so much to accomplish.

34:23.981 --> 34:25.190
Just think of it.

34:25.399 --> 34:27.317
Your own line of perfumes.

34:29.402 --> 34:31.612
Caroline, the mammogram came back.

34:31.989 --> 34:32.406
And?

34:32.489 --> 34:33.699
Inconclusive.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.409
The radiologist saw something.

34:36.702 --> 34:38.203
The technology is so good these days,

34:38.203 --> 34:39.913
you get a lot of false positives.

34:40.414 --> 34:42.206
You just need to go for a biopsy.

34:42.291 --> 34:44.001
Could it be a cyst?

34:44.293 --> 34:46.210
Well, that's what the biopsy will tell us.

34:46.587 --> 34:48.797
I don't think you have anything
to worry about.

34:50.591 --> 34:52.217
Lulu will call you to book an appointment

34:52.217 --> 34:54.594
as soon as her computer's up.
I gotta run.

34:54.594 --> 34:58.015
My grandson's daycare
is closing early because of the blackout.

34:58.682 --> 34:59.808
Okay, thank you.

35:00.517 --> 35:01.185
Caroline?

35:01.185 --> 35:02.895
There's been another explosion.

35:03.187 --> 35:04.104
Chicago.

35:04.688 --> 35:08.692
This is the result of the probe we ran
in the wiring for the Buffalo substation.

35:09.318 --> 35:11.987
This is from samples
we received today, Chicago.

35:13.113 --> 35:14.281
Same wire.

35:14.781 --> 35:16.491
There are a number
of wire manufacturers,

35:16.992 --> 35:18.994
but these 2 are both from Pacific North.

35:19.411 --> 35:20.787
Okay, so we've explosions at
2 different substations,

35:20.787 --> 35:23.081
same wire, can't be a coincidence.

35:24.291 --> 35:27.002
What's around these wires that
they like so much?

35:28.712 --> 35:30.214
We're going to Chicago, Bob.

35:30.297 --> 35:31.006
No, I can't,

35:31.089 --> 35:33.509
I have fluorescence-glowing
bacteria growing...

35:33.884 --> 35:35.302
I have a meeting.

35:37.387 --> 35:39.097
- Oh. Okay, I'll take Jill.
- You will?

35:40.307 --> 35:41.600
Yes, why not?

35:42.184 --> 35:43.310
Safe trip.

35:45.312 --> 35:45.812
Thanks.

35:54.279 --> 35:57.282
Oh, Chicago! I got an idea.

35:57.616 --> 35:58.909
Why don't we get a little wire,

35:58.909 --> 36:01.411
and find ourselves a hotel and relax?

36:01.495 --> 36:02.287
Which hotel?

36:02.287 --> 36:04.498
The one where we met
was pretty nice.

36:04.998 --> 36:08.001
Get a couple bottles of champagne,
maybe go a little crazy?

36:08.210 --> 36:09.711
That's an even better idea!

36:10.212 --> 36:11.880
How about we get a little wire

36:12.214 --> 36:14.216
and then make our 7 o'clock flight
back to Toronto?

36:14.383 --> 36:16.093
- Doesn't sound like as much fun.
- No, it doesn't!

36:17.886 --> 36:19.012
Yo, something here boss.

36:24.184 --> 36:25.686
Well, see what I see?

36:27.980 --> 36:29.106
- Bunch of burnt wires.
- Yeah.

36:29.982 --> 36:31.900
Lucky our wires didn't get scorched.

36:33.610 --> 36:36.113
Open wide, say ah...

36:37.781 --> 36:40.200
Hello mama!

36:42.286 --> 36:43.704
Rotten eggs!

36:47.207 --> 36:49.001
Take this and bottle some of it.

36:50.586 --> 36:51.587
Thank you.

36:52.713 --> 36:54.381
Ha! Rotten eggs and garlic!

36:54.715 --> 36:57.593
David, I think you just found
the star of the Bacteria Street Boys.

36:57.885 --> 36:58.719
What?

37:01.388 --> 37:02.514
Yeah, it's David.

37:04.308 --> 37:05.184
Oh, really?

37:08.187 --> 37:08.979
Okay, thanks.

37:10.814 --> 37:11.690
David!

37:12.983 --> 37:15.319
It's eaten away at some of
the insulation, here.

37:16.195 --> 37:16.904
Cool.

37:16.987 --> 37:19.114
Except that no bacteria eats plastic.

37:19.406 --> 37:20.490
It gets even weirder.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.993
Turns out the plastic around these wires is

37:23.202 --> 37:26.496
the same insulation
used on 50% of the wires in the country.

37:27.706 --> 37:28.582
All right boys and girls,

37:28.582 --> 37:30.918
I give you
the star of the Bacteria Street Boys.

37:31.001 --> 37:32.503
Red viscous material,

37:32.503 --> 37:34.087
stinks, definitely biological,

37:34.296 --> 37:36.298
found on the underground cables
in Chicago,

37:36.590 --> 37:38.091
just slathered all over, eating it. So,

37:38.884 --> 37:40.594
we need a complete set of tests on this.

37:40.594 --> 37:41.595
Bob, I want you to grow it.

37:42.387 --> 37:43.388
Bob! Don't just stand there,

37:43.388 --> 37:44.890
let's get going! Mayko, you sequence.

37:45.307 --> 37:47.100
Jill, taxonomy, I want to know
what this is related to.

37:47.309 --> 37:48.393
Carlos, you and I are going upstairs.

37:50.812 --> 37:53.106
Hey. Mick.

37:55.317 --> 37:57.903
Not that you can hear me, obviously.

37:59.196 --> 38:00.906
Not that I

38:01.114 --> 38:02.908
you know, want you to hear me,

38:04.910 --> 38:07.496
because I have nothing
intelligent to say.

38:09.998 --> 38:11.917
Except that I miss you.

38:58.297 --> 39:00.799
We're dealing with
a completely new species.

39:01.091 --> 39:02.509
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

39:02.885 --> 39:04.011
David, something else.

39:04.303 --> 39:06.597
This thing seems to have evolved

39:06.597 --> 39:08.682
to breathe off metals.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.185
What do you think?

39:11.602 --> 39:12.811
Begin looking at a completely new species.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.188
Okay, where did it come from?

39:14.897 --> 39:16.815
Do you think that someone actually
introduced these bacteria into the soil

39:16.982 --> 39:18.317
to blow things up?

39:18.483 --> 39:19.818
Because I can't grow it.

39:19.985 --> 39:21.111
Maybe something... Listen!

39:21.987 --> 39:25.407
Okay, maybe
something made this bacteria by...

39:26.116 --> 39:27.284
What the fuck are we missing?

39:29.620 --> 39:30.704
Okay. We've got a new bacterium

39:31.121 --> 39:33.707
that manages somehow
to destroy hydroelectric cables

39:34.082 --> 39:35.292
by eating through the insulation

39:35.501 --> 39:38.003
so the wires can spark an explosion.

39:38.295 --> 39:39.880
Sounds stupid just saying it!

39:40.088 --> 39:41.715
If it can eat plastic and insulation,

39:42.007 --> 39:44.718
then every biology book in the world will
have to be rewritten.

39:45.302 --> 39:46.887
Except that we can't grow it in the lab, so...

39:47.012 --> 39:48.305
We can't grow it in the lab.

39:48.305 --> 39:49.097
But why can't we grow it in a lab?

39:51.099 --> 39:52.017
You say it's got genes

39:52.100 --> 39:55.187
that can only be found
in bacteria that breathe metal, right?

39:55.312 --> 39:56.605
Hmm-hmm, so it needs metals to live.

39:57.481 --> 39:58.815
Ever try feeding it metals?

40:01.485 --> 40:02.194
Bob?

40:05.405 --> 40:07.199
Well, I... Metals?

40:07.199 --> 40:08.700
From the wire.

40:08.909 --> 40:10.202
Of course!

40:11.620 --> 40:13.413
How did the metals get into the soil

40:13.580 --> 40:15.916
if they're surrounded by
insulation and plastic?

40:16.500 --> 40:19.086
It must have leeched through somehow.
Hang on a second...

40:24.299 --> 40:26.802
God damn it, that's exactly
how it happened!

40:27.219 --> 40:29.888
Okay, this metal in the wire is
loaded with current, right?

40:30.013 --> 40:31.181
So it heats up and that allows it

40:31.306 --> 40:32.307
to somehow leech through

40:33.100 --> 40:35.811
a stress point or a crack
in the insulation, into the soil,

40:36.019 --> 40:38.313
where our bacteria sucks
it right in. That's it!

40:38.814 --> 40:40.691
It breathe the metal, then
change it genetically.

40:41.984 --> 40:44.194
So that the new species
could eat the plastic.

40:44.820 --> 40:45.696
Simple.

40:46.989 --> 40:48.282
Not that simple.

40:50.617 --> 40:51.785
Okay, come on.

40:52.494 --> 40:54.121
Composition of the wire?
What?

40:54.204 --> 40:55.914
The wire, I need the formula.

40:56.707 --> 40:57.791
Wes, where is the..?

40:57.791 --> 41:00.419
There's a report
from the wiring manufacturer.

41:00.711 --> 41:03.088
It mentioned the name of a
metal in wiring,

41:03.589 --> 41:05.591
I remember because it
was so unusual.

41:06.508 --> 41:08.218
I marked it, circled it here.

41:09.803 --> 41:10.596
Buffalo.

41:11.305 --> 41:13.307
Chicago. The same manufacturer,

41:13.307 --> 41:14.308
the same metal.

41:15.684 --> 41:16.894
Well, what do you know!

41:19.605 --> 41:20.981
Tellurium!

41:21.690 --> 41:22.900
- Tellurium.
- What?

41:23.400 --> 41:25.319
It's a metal. The power companies
were using it for a while,

41:25.319 --> 41:27.696
- but it got too expensive.
- You think that's it?

41:27.821 --> 41:29.781
Could be. I want you to call
around, find a metal supplier.

41:30.282 --> 41:31.783
David, it's midnight.

41:33.785 --> 41:34.494
Sorry.

41:35.204 --> 41:38.290
Tellurium delirium.
Call first thing in the morning.

41:38.582 --> 41:39.917
Everybody go home!

41:47.799 --> 41:49.718
Here it is! Pure tellurium.

41:49.718 --> 41:51.011
Okay, right over here.

41:52.387 --> 41:54.014
Symbol TE,

41:54.223 --> 41:55.516
atomic number 52,

41:55.682 --> 41:57.809
silvery white,
brittle, P-type semi-conductor

41:58.018 --> 42:00.521
believed to be the source of odour
and garlic.

42:00.896 --> 42:02.022
Sort of like that red goo smell.

42:02.689 --> 42:05.317
Okay, Bob, let's see
if our little bug likes

42:05.609 --> 42:07.110
to breathe tellurium and eat plastic.

42:07.319 --> 42:10.322
We'll have to grow it plus and minus
each of the components. Michael?

42:11.990 --> 42:12.699
Which components?

42:13.116 --> 42:14.409
Plastic and tellurium.

42:14.785 --> 42:16.787
- See we are going to prove--
- Or disprove.

42:16.995 --> 42:18.997
...or disprove that the red goo grows

42:18.997 --> 42:23.085
only when everything's added to the stew
and not when any single ingredient is left out.

42:23.418 --> 42:24.711
And the way we do that

42:25.921 --> 42:27.089
is we try everything.

42:27.297 --> 42:30.801
Plastic, insulation, tellurium
in any combination.

42:31.009 --> 42:32.094
How long before we
have something?

42:33.220 --> 42:35.222
- Couple of days.
- One way or the other.

42:35.389 --> 42:36.390
Yeah, I got a hunch, tough.

42:36.890 --> 42:39.017
Somehow the tellurium
got into the soil, right,

42:39.393 --> 42:41.603
a crack in the insulation, a bad splice,
it doesn't matter.

42:41.895 --> 42:43.188
It got there, and was exposed to

42:43.188 --> 42:46.316
one of 100,000 different kinds
of bacteria living in that.

42:46.817 --> 42:48.485
And into one of those microscopic bugs,

42:48.485 --> 42:50.696
the tellurium started a mutation process.

42:53.115 --> 42:56.201
And suddenly it became
the amazing plastic-eating red goo

42:56.493 --> 42:58.203
that took out the entire northeast
of the continent.

42:58.203 --> 42:59.288
Put that back on.

43:00.122 --> 43:02.791
So, you're telling me these events,
both of these blackouts

43:02.916 --> 43:04.001
were naturally occurring?

43:04.084 --> 43:06.003
- That's what we're saying?
- No terrorist involvement?

43:06.086 --> 43:08.005
None!
You know, unless

43:08.422 --> 43:09.923
the terrorists somehow conspired

43:10.090 --> 43:12.009
to have the tellurium added to the wires,

43:12.009 --> 43:13.802
knowing, smart little bugs that they are,

43:14.011 --> 43:15.721
- that someday, it would leech through--
- David...

43:17.222 --> 43:18.307
How much of this tellurium is out there?

43:18.307 --> 43:20.184
That's something you better find out.

43:22.019 --> 43:23.604
So much for terrorists.

43:24.605 --> 43:27.107
I'd have your CIA boys take
another look at those intercepts.

43:28.483 --> 43:31.486
You know, a written apology to me
would be nice, for treating me like--

43:31.820 --> 43:34.907
I can assure you that your work
will be shown to the proper authorities.

43:35.490 --> 43:36.408
Thank you.

43:37.201 --> 43:38.493
Who's going to foot
the bill for the retrofit?

43:39.119 --> 43:41.705
Taxpayers, most likely. And if
the government spends it properly,

43:41.914 --> 43:44.499
they should be able to make it look
as if it's a cheap solution.

43:44.917 --> 43:47.419
Wait a minute! What about the
bacterium? It eats plastic!

43:47.920 --> 43:49.796
Yes, well, we should look into that.

43:50.422 --> 43:52.799
Think of all the plastic in
all those garbage dumps.

43:53.091 --> 43:55.093
Now, you tweak this thing
and learn how to control it,

43:55.093 --> 43:56.220
it'll be worth a mint.

43:56.303 --> 43:59.723
Developed in a government-sponsored lab?
I wouldn't buy the Rolls just yet, Dave.

44:01.099 --> 44:02.017
Nice work.

44:09.191 --> 44:16.615
/* Some of us need protection
from a sad kind of weapon */

44:17.282 --> 44:22.996
/* All of the imperfections
we perceive can start to */

44:23.622 --> 44:30.504
/* Threaten us to believe that
we can't be loved */

44:32.005 --> 44:39.012
/* When all we need is to be home */

44:42.516 --> 44:49.022
/* Hope for angels is a heart that's open */

44:50.107 --> 44:57.406
/* So far angels can't be scared away */

44:58.323 --> 45:05.789
/* Hope for angels can be
chaos and rejection */

45:06.623 --> 45:13.005
/* I'm alone for angels */

45:15.090 --> 45:18.385
/* Some of us have addictions */

45:19.011 --> 45:23.223
/* Offer aid into afflictions */

45:23.807 --> 45:30.314
/* Why do we covet pain as
our crystal path of predictions? */

45:31.023 --> 45:36.987
/* We better believe we can be loved */

45:38.197 --> 45:42.409
/* When all we need is to... */

45:42.492 --> 45:43.285
Are you there?

45:46.914 --> 45:47.998
Yeah.

45:48.790 --> 45:53.295
- I'm back 2 school 2morrow...
- "...kinda nervous."

45:56.006 --> 45:57.090
You'll be okay.

45:58.008 --> 45:59.510
(Not so sure about the school.)

46:01.512 --> 46:03.388
Get this, I think I want to
be a scientist

46:04.097 --> 46:06.099
when (if!) I grow up.

46:11.522 --> 46:14.399
"Gtg ttyl?"

46:19.404 --> 46:20.822
You're such a loser!

46:20.989 --> 46:22.699
I'll see you later.

46:48.016 --> 46:50.310
I've been offered
a senior position in another lab.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.187
Oh.

46:52.604 --> 46:55.107
- You okay? You seem a little tense.
- I'm fine!

46:55.315 --> 46:57.317
I think I see where Jill went wrong.

46:57.609 --> 46:58.819
You're Louise Raposa?

46:59.319 --> 47:01.905
Two sets of doctors said our
illness had nothing to do with Iraq.

47:02.322 --> 47:04.908
One hired by Powell
support, one by the Pentagon.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.618
- Welcome to Canada.
- Thank you.

47:07.286 --> 47:09.204
So we spent a week loading out
these bombed out buildings,

47:09.496 --> 47:11.915
even the dirt under them into these
big biohazard barrels.

47:12.207 --> 47:13.292
And what was in the buildings?

47:13.292 --> 47:16.086
Iraqi military supplies.
They wouldn't tell us more.

47:16.086 --> 47:17.713
Now 10 of us are fucking dying.

47:18.422 --> 47:21.300
They weren't exposed to anything. They were
using state of the art Hazmat gear.

47:21.592 --> 47:23.093
So the question is:
Why would you give these

47:23.594 --> 47:26.513
to a bunch of non-military,
glorified garbage collectors?

47:26.805 --> 47:28.891
We complain when people
aren't properly suited,

47:29.224 --> 47:30.601
now we're suspicious when they are?

47:30.893 --> 47:32.895
Severe anti-coagulation syndrome.

47:33.312 --> 47:35.105
- What causes it?
- We don't know.

47:35.522 --> 47:37.399
All right, why don't you two pack a bag?

47:46.200 --> 47:48.994
