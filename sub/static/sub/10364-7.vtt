You forgot to wear your seat belt.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.160
Yes. Why do you think I forgot?

00:34.080 --> 00:36.200
You're a naughty girl, aren't you?

00:37.760 --> 00:40.080
I'm not wearing any knickers either.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.960
Sounds like someone needs a licking
as punishment when we get home.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.360
Do we have to wait that long?

00:56.400 --> 00:58.800
Just go ahead and lift your skirt up.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.440
- You might want to put it in fifth.
- [Ane] Yeah, sure.

The sheep is dead. Let's just drive on.

01:54.240 --> 01:58.200
- [Ane] Are you sure...?
- Don't come here. Don't look...

01:58.280 --> 02:00.720
- No, don't...
- [Ane gasps] Oh, God.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.680
- [Jan] Ane, stop!
- Oh, good God.

02:05.240 --> 02:10.840
- Take it easy.
- [Ane] Good grief, we've run over a man!

02:10.920 --> 02:16.040
Let's take a moment to think
this through. How will this look?

02:16.120 --> 02:19.680
You killed that man
because you were so bloody horny!

02:19.760 --> 02:23.880
What will your girlfriends
at the Women's Center say?

02:23.960 --> 02:26.040
Do you know who this is?

02:26.120 --> 02:31.200
This is the father-in-law
of the worst gangster in the county,

02:31.280 --> 02:33.120
Johnny Henriksen.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.040
So just forget about prison!

02:36.120 --> 02:40.560
Johnny is more
of an "eye for an eye" kind of guy.

[Johnny chuckles]

03:44.440 --> 03:47.320
So, here's an idea.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.840
Why don't you take the day off
and we can go out and have some fun?

03:51.920 --> 03:55.000
You know I'd love to do that.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.880
But you've met my employees.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.280
- [Alex groans]
- Let me put it this way,

03:59.360 --> 04:02.320
did you ever see a program called
The Three Stooges  down in Brazil?

04:02.400 --> 04:04.000
- It's that bad, huh?
- Yes, it's that bad.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.160
[Alex laughs] Okay.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.640
But I'm going

How is life as a farmer out here?

04:20.280 --> 04:22.320
[farmer on TV]  It's not how it used to be.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.600
[in English] Hey, baby.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.720
Hope you're not planning on partying here.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.160
We have a very strict policy
about serving alcohol to pregnant women.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.760
[in Norwegian] Very funny.
[in English] Very funny, Johnny.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.240
[in Norwegian] We agreed to be honest
as far as the kids were concerned.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.000
[in English] And then I find out
that you're lying to me.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.960
When did you plan to tell me
about your new girlfriend?

04:45.040 --> 04:46.400
What girlfriend?

04:46.480 --> 04:50.600
Chris saw you and this beautiful
Latin American girl in her early 20s.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.600
Oh, Alex.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.880
"Oh, Alex." So that's her name.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.720
That's the name of my new live-in nanny...

04:59.720 --> 05:05.080
...that I got to provide
a new healthy environment for the kids.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.640

05:44.120 --> 05:45.840
[in English] You got any leads?

05:46.760 --> 05:49.320
We have a witness
who saw a car drive away.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.160
Well, that's good, right?
I mean, it's only a matter of time?

05:53.240 --> 05:57.240
Well, it's a hit-and-run
in a remote place. It can be difficult.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.320
- [in Norwegian] I need you to sign this.
- Yes.

- [David] Of course.

don't you worry.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.680
And there will be justice,

06:49.760 --> 06:51.280
I promise you.

this. Where's that boyfriend of yours?

[in Norwegian] I don't know.
I can't get hold of him.

an escape from reality.

and I'm addicted to gaming.

we touch each other.

- No...

Hmm?

Yes, it is.

You've satisfied yourself with my body,

Listen to yourself. You sound

- That's enough!

30:18.840 --> 30:20.240
Yeah.

30:21.840 --> 30:25.640
Well, I'm on my way to my nightclub
in Hafjell. Why don't you come along?

30:29.480 --> 30:30.480
Yeah.

[in Norwegian] Hello, Aslak. How are you?

30:56.520 --> 31:01.760
Oh, you know. I'm sorry
I didn't get here in time for the funeral.

31:01.840 --> 31:06.520
I came by
to put some flowers on his grave.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.800
Thank you so much.
Dad would have appreciated that.

31:10.800 --> 31:11.800
Look.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.560

31:21.840 --> 31:23.440
Work accident.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.480
- Work accident?
- Yeah.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.280
Aslak, I can't help you
if you're not gonna be straight with me.

[Alex chuckles]

33:19.800 --> 33:21.800
What is this place?

33:23.360 --> 33:24.840
What? You don't recognize it?

33:25.560 --> 33:27.280
Hmm... Uh-uh.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.360
It's a miniature Lillehammer.

33:31.920 --> 33:35.320
Okay.
As if Lillehammer isn't small enough?

33:39.760 --> 33:41.000
So...

33:42.920 --> 33:44.560
...why did you take me here?

33:44.640 --> 33:46.560
I just wanted to ask you a question.

Yo, Lothario.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.920
I thought you were leaving town.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.880
Or did you make another wrong turn?

34:23.840 --> 34:27.280
What's the matter, Frank? This town
ain't big enough for the two of us?

34:28.600 --> 34:29.720
Cute.

34:30.600 --> 34:34.440
You know what your problem is?
You're becoming too Norwegian.

[Alex] Let me explain.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.680
- Please?
- [Johnny] I really don't want to hear it.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.360
As for you,
you're leaving this fucking country.

No, not in the living room,
but in the wet rooms, obviously.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.320
Yeah.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.360
I see. Can I just ask one question?

35:55.360 --> 35:56.960
Why are you selling?

35:57.040 --> 36:01.000
My wife thinks Lillehammer
is getting a bit rough.

36:01.080 --> 36:06.680
It's perfect that you're moving, though,
as we have a baby on the way.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.000
