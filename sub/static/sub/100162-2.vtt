WEBVTT

00:16.720 --> 00:20.360
[Lascelles] As His Majesty the King
has not yet produced a male successor,

00:20.440 --> 00:23.520
nor do we at this stage expect one,

00:23.600 --> 00:27.120
the decision has been taken to start
preparing you in earnest for the Crown.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.080
From this moment on,

00:29.160 --> 00:31.080
you will no longer be
the heir presumptive,

00:31.160 --> 00:34.680
but the heir apparent,
and your life will be quite different.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.680
You will not be able
to travel unaccompanied,

00:38.240 --> 00:40.520
nor to socialize as freely.

00:41.840 --> 00:46.520
Your father, the King, had little
or no time to prepare for the throne,

00:46.600 --> 00:48.400
which was thrust upon him.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.400
We will not be caught out again.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.160
The Crown is not just an ornament
to be worn.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.520
It is a privilege and a burden,

00:59.080 --> 01:04.120
which comes with formidable expectations
and responsibilities.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.760
[door opens]

01:27.040 --> 01:28.600
I don't think I can do it.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.680
[Margaret] I could.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.080
I know you could.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.680
[Margaret] I'd love every minute.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.520
To be on every coin, on every banknote,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.840
to be the most famous woman
in the world.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.960
I'd be so very good at it.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.360
Wearing a big crown,
giving everyone orders.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
Yes.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
Then tell them,

01:57.320 --> 01:59.000
"Margaret Rose can do it.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.520
Margaret Rose wants to do it.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.160
Margaret Rose was born to do it."

02:05.800 --> 02:06.920
You were.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.960
Then let me speak to them tomorrow.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.200
It would be the best thing for both of us.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.400
All right.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.960
[Margaret chuckles] Good.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.960
[crowd cheers]

03:00.600 --> 03:03.000
[cheering]

03:08.080 --> 03:09.320
[Elizabeth] Hello, you.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.360
Your Majesty.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.400
Just come to wish you a bon voyage
and to thank you.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.080
What for?

03:23.160 --> 03:25.640
For agreeing to squeeze in
so many public engagements

03:25.720 --> 03:27.480
on what is essentially a private trip.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.320
-And for flying this way, commercially.
-[Margaret] Well, it's not so bad.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.440
They've cleared out the first-class cabin
just for us.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.960
What's the first stop? New York?

03:37.040 --> 03:39.400
Uh, San Francisco. Then Los Angeles.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.040
Then five days
with the Douglases in Arizona.

03:42.840 --> 03:43.840
How lovely.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.880
Then on to New York,
where Tony is promoting his book.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.360
-You've written a book?
-Uh, a book of my photographs.

03:50.840 --> 03:51.920
Oh, you are clever.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.760
You must make time to really relax, too.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.280
[Margaret] We will.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.080
Be good to one another.
Kind to one another.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.440
Both of you.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.480
[Margaret]
Sad she felt the need to say that.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.440
[Tony] What?

04:09.520 --> 04:13.000
"Be good to one another.
Kind to one another. Both of you."

04:13.080 --> 04:15.440
[sighs] It was a little clumsy.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.200
But she means well.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.880
The two of us...

04:21.760 --> 04:23.000
we're complicated.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.320
She and I are complicated.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.440
[Tony] It's true.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.120
Elder sister, younger sister.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.040
Number one and number two.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.240
Who's number one?

04:36.840 --> 04:38.720
You. Of course.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.080
A natural number one whose tragedy it is
to have been born number two.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.080
Hmm. That is my burden.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.120
She knows it, too.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.720
Yes, I think she does.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.920
-[speaker beeps]
-That's her burden.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.280
[announcer] Welcome aboard
this BOAC flight to San Francisco.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.080
Please take your seats and relax.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.400
We're now ready for departure
and will be taxiing shortly.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.480
We'd like to take this opportunity
to wish you a very pleasant flight.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.160
-[soldier] Ten-hut!
-[feet stamp]

06:51.080 --> 06:52.400
Good morning, Mr. Ambassador.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.720
[Dean]
Economically, as you know, Marvin,

06:54.800 --> 06:57.200
the United Kingdom is right up against it.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.320
It's seeing a terrifying run on sterling,

06:59.400 --> 07:02.040
and our credit from the IMF
is about to expire.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.640
Now, the Prime Minister
has made several attempts

07:05.720 --> 07:08.240
to speak to the President
about another bailout,

07:08.760 --> 07:10.000
a rescue package.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.000
But the President refuses
to take his call.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.800
[Watson] President Johnson is a busy man.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.000
Too busy to talk to his oldest ally?

07:19.520 --> 07:21.240
Historically, the holder of this office

07:21.320 --> 07:24.280
has the warmest relationship
with Downing Street.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.280
Think of Churchill and Roosevelt,

07:26.360 --> 07:29.640
or Truman and Attlee. Macmillan and JFK.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.520
No need to keep mentioning
Jack Kennedy like that.

07:33.880 --> 07:34.880
Keep mentioning?

07:34.960 --> 07:36.240
It's just provocative.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.960
Unhelpful.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.640
President Johnson is his own man.

07:41.720 --> 07:42.720
Well, of course.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.840
I mentioned it only in the context
of our leaders

07:45.920 --> 07:48.280
standing shoulder to shoulder
in times of difficulty.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.680
Morning, Prime Minister.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.880
[Dean]
The United Kingdom and the United States.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.240
Historically, it's like a marriage.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.400
Will you talk to him?

08:01.480 --> 08:04.720
No! Screw the Brits!
I don't like 'em. I never liked 'em.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.760
If they're not looking down at you
through their noses,

08:06.840 --> 08:08.560
they're holding their hands out
like beggars.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.960
And I don't give a crap
about any special relationship.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.400
Harold Wilson wants my help,
he should have thought about that

08:13.480 --> 08:15.160
when he refused
to support me over Vietnam.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.720
You can't screw a man in the ass
and then expect him to buy you flowers!

08:24.440 --> 08:27.400
-The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.360
Prime Minister.

08:39.800 --> 08:44.280
Uh, I'm sure that it did not
escape your attention

08:44.360 --> 08:47.760
that President Johnson failed to attend
Mr. Winston's funeral.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.000
Yes, on account of a cold.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.280
Well, that was the explanation
the White House gave,

08:52.360 --> 08:53.640
but it persuaded no one.

08:54.280 --> 08:59.280
Uh... I fear that the President
may have taken against me

08:59.360 --> 09:03.560
for what he sees as my failure
to support him over Vietnam.

09:04.440 --> 09:07.360
And I wondered... [coughs]

09:09.080 --> 09:10.720
[clears throat] ...in the past,

09:11.760 --> 09:15.320
the royal family
has been extremely helpful

09:15.400 --> 09:17.920
in keeping
the special relationship afloat.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.560
And given the...

09:22.080 --> 09:25.280
predicament the country
finds itself in economically--

09:25.360 --> 09:29.160
You'd like us to roll out the red carpet.
Make a bit of a fuss.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.120
Please.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.680
All right.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.840
I shall consult the Three Wise Men.
See what they have to say.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.160
Thank you, ma'am.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.000
[photographer 1] Welcome to San Francisco!

09:46.080 --> 09:48.760
Margaret! Margaret, over here! Over here!

09:48.840 --> 09:51.280
[photographer 2] Picture, right this way!
Thank you, Margaret.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.560
[Tony] "What we have witnessed
in Princess Margaret

09:54.640 --> 09:59.440
is a more vibrant, modern,
and engaging version of her older sister."

09:59.520 --> 10:01.120
[chuckles] Quite right.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.800
[Tony] "To those accustomed to
the formality of traditional royal visits,

10:06.880 --> 10:10.880
meeting Princess Margaret has been
like going from a black-and-white film

10:10.960 --> 10:12.520
to one in color."

10:13.040 --> 10:14.360
What about a state dinner,

10:14.800 --> 10:17.560
like the one held
for Woodrow Wilson in 1918?

10:17.640 --> 10:19.200
Or a weekend at Windsor Castle?

10:19.280 --> 10:21.160
The important thing here, I'm told,

10:21.240 --> 10:23.440
is that whatever we offer
President Johnson,

10:23.520 --> 10:26.200
it must exceed
whatever we gave the Kennedys.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.400
["When You're Smiling" playing]

10:28.480 --> 10:30.680
[reporter 1]
Hey, we wanted to see the Queen!

10:31.040 --> 10:33.280
[Margaret] You're seeing something
better than the Queen!

10:33.360 --> 10:36.640
[reporter 2] What do you think is the main
difference between Britain and America?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.800
[Margaret] Well, my sister isn't
on the banknotes here!

10:38.880 --> 10:39.760
[laughter]

10:39.840 --> 10:42.520
[reporter 3] What are you most
looking forward to in America?

10:44.040 --> 10:44.960

[Elizabeth]
What news of Princess Margaret?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.360
After three days in San Francisco,

11:13.440 --> 11:16.480
Her Royal Highness
has safely arrived in Los Angeles.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.280
Any disasters I should be aware of?

11:18.360 --> 11:21.200
No, on the contrary, the trip seems
to have been a great success.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.000
Really?

11:23.080 --> 11:25.360
[Charteris] There's rave reviews
in all the newspapers...

11:25.440 --> 11:26.720
[crowd cheers]

11:26.800 --> 11:30.240
...with even a name having been coined
for the multitude of fans and well-wishers

11:30.320 --> 11:32.200
who have followed her
every step of the way.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.200
-Which is?
-Margaretologists.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.320
Margaretologists?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.720
-[cameras click]
-[Charteris] Yes, ma'am.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.960
Fans who have delighted

11:41.040 --> 11:44.120
in Her Royal Highness's intelligence
and articulacy, her beauty

11:44.200 --> 11:46.840
and charm, with one newspaper,
The San Francisco Chronicle,

11:46.920 --> 11:47.920
even going so far as--

11:48.000 --> 11:50.240
-Yes, all right. Thank you, Martin.
-Uh, yes, ma'am.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.800
I'm a queen, not a saint.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.880
[Tony] That's it. Try not to smile.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.520
[laughter]

12:06.640 --> 12:07.880
[laughs]

12:10.920 --> 12:12.160
[Tony] I gave it!

12:12.240 --> 12:15.160
Not once, not twice, but three times,
and you ignored it!

12:15.240 --> 12:16.320
[Margaret] What?

12:16.400 --> 12:17.680
The signal!

12:17.760 --> 12:19.640
Our signal that I wanted to leave.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.120
[Margaret] I didn't see it.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.960
You know as well as I
that if you are the guest of honor,

12:25.040 --> 12:27.560
you cannot just leave.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.200
In the course of our marriage,
I have lost count of the number of times

12:31.280 --> 12:33.200
you've walked out as "guest of honor."

12:33.760 --> 12:36.240
-Once or twice.
-All the bloody time.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.920
-When it's dreary.
-When it suits you!

12:39.800 --> 12:42.520
When the people are ugly and dull.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.800
These people were amusing and attractive.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.040
And they made me feel good.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.280
No, no, no, no.
The alcohol made you feel good...

12:55.360 --> 12:57.200
and blunted your judgment

12:57.280 --> 12:59.720
to the sycophancy
of the people surrounding you.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.560
[Margaret] Is that right?

13:01.640 --> 13:03.440
-[Tony] Yes. Keys.
-Well...

13:03.520 --> 13:07.200
sadly, it's not blunted my judgment

13:07.280 --> 13:11.960
to your mean-spiritedness
and jealousy and...

13:12.480 --> 13:14.800
general pusillanimity...

13:14.880 --> 13:16.120
pusinalamn...

13:18.040 --> 13:19.400
Small-mindedness.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.200
[Margaret] I don't recognize this.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.640
Hmm.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.440
Come to think of it,
I don't recognize you.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.640
Actually... [chuckles]

13:32.480 --> 13:34.080
...nor did anyone else!

13:35.000 --> 13:37.480
I mean, if we're honest...

13:37.760 --> 13:39.240
[chuckles]

13:39.600 --> 13:42.480
...isn't that the real problem here, hmm?

13:44.720 --> 13:47.240
[in American accent] Oh, I'm sorry.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.080
A-A-And... and you are... Tony who?

13:50.720 --> 13:53.320
Oh, yeah! The husband guy.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.600
It's not easy, sometimes.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.400
What is not easy?

14:00.520 --> 14:03.840
Being second fiddle to a pygmy princess.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.200
Don't talk to me
about being a second fiddle.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.000
I get so little limelight.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.960
[laughs loudly]

14:13.040 --> 14:16.080
No, it's the price I pay
for the sister I have.

14:16.160 --> 14:21.240
But if the opportunity should once arise
for me to shine,

14:21.960 --> 14:26.160
I'd appreciate you putting aside
the competitive little narcissist

14:26.240 --> 14:27.360
that rages within you...

14:31.040 --> 14:33.280
and letting me savor it.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.720
[shoe falls]

14:41.600 --> 14:42.720
I promise...

14:43.880 --> 14:45.960
that once we get to New York,

14:47.480 --> 14:50.040
the spotlight will be entirely on you,

14:50.880 --> 14:51.880
and your book.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.640
I'll take a back seat

14:54.720 --> 14:58.040
and be the adoring
and supportive number two

14:58.440 --> 15:00.000
you want me to be.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.480
And nothing will make me happier.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.480
[car approaches]

15:15.160 --> 15:17.800
[Johnson] Now, you can tell me
all you want that 50,000,

15:17.880 --> 15:21.000
hell, 100,000 more boots on the ground
are going to resolve this.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.480
But I put 100,000 more men in there,

15:23.560 --> 15:26.520
who's to say that Ho Chi Minh
isn't gonna put 100,000 more?

15:26.960 --> 15:31.680
A man can't fight if he can't see daylight
at the end of the road.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.840
I wanna see solutions, gentlemen,
solutions.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.760
Not more numbers!

15:37.600 --> 15:40.080
By God, I will not be
the first American president

15:40.160 --> 15:41.960
to lose a goddamn war!

15:42.200 --> 15:44.400
-[knocking at door]
-[door opens]

15:44.480 --> 15:46.560
-That'll be all.
-Yes, sir, Mr. President.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.680
[Johnson sighs]

15:51.240 --> 15:52.240
Thank you.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.120
What is this?

16:00.880 --> 16:04.560
[Watson] A peace offering from the Brits,
hoping to secure the bailout.

16:07.280 --> 16:12.360
-A weekend shooting at Balmoral?
-Yes, sir. That's as good as it gets.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.480
Even Kennedy never got that.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.520
Really?

16:16.600 --> 16:21.120
He got a banquet, a Naval Guard of Honor,
but never a weekend shooting in Scotland.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.680
No one has gotten that.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.080
Hmm.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.440
[sighs] Still...

16:35.240 --> 16:36.720
that's a long flight,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.360
followed by a long drive...

16:40.600 --> 16:42.520
staying in some creepy haunted castle.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.160
-[Watson chuckles]
-The weather's terrible.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.320
[sighs] And it would involve
making small talk to fancy people.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.920
Then when you go shooting,

16:54.480 --> 16:57.560
there's rules,
things you do and don't do,

16:58.760 --> 17:01.920
which would involve research
and learning...

17:02.360 --> 17:03.600
cutting my nails...

17:04.840 --> 17:06.600
and I'd still get it all wrong.

17:07.480 --> 17:11.320
And then everybody would laugh at me
and they'd say I wasn't no Jack Kennedy,

17:11.400 --> 17:15.800
who would know exactly which knife
and fork to use and which bird to shoot.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.360
-So, my position has not changed.
-Hmm.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.080
It is still,
"No, thank you, Your Majesty."

17:25.360 --> 17:28.840
Tomorrow, there's the reception given
by the Council of Engineering Institutions

17:28.920 --> 17:30.080
at the Science Museum,

17:30.320 --> 17:34.960
followed by an audience with
His Excellency Guðmundur Guðmundsson,

17:35.040 --> 17:37.800
the new ambassador
for the Republic of Iceland.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.960
Thank you, Michael.
And where are we with President Johnson?

17:41.400 --> 17:45.880
Ah, we went back offering
a weekend shooting in Balmoral.

17:45.960 --> 17:50.080
Did we? Lucky LBJ.
We don't get enough of those ourselves.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.760
-And?
-No response, ma'am.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.120
-What?
-Nothing. Complete silence.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.440
-That's a first.
-Yes.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.440
And probably not
what Downing Street was hoping for.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.680
-Is everyone panicking?
-Slightly.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.120
-What about Princess Margaret?
-Oh, safely arrived in Arizona, ma'am.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.280
Oh, well, that's something.
At the Douglas family ranch?

18:09.360 --> 18:11.160
-Yes.
-I've never been.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.520
-What do we know about it?
-They say it's quite something.

18:13.920 --> 18:17.200
A beautiful 19th-century country house
set under the Santa Rita mountains,

18:17.280 --> 18:19.720
in miles and miles of wide-open desert.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.320
[horse neighs]

19:01.320 --> 19:02.640
-[Margaret coughs]
-Tony!

19:02.720 --> 19:03.920
-Tony.
-Brace yourselves.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.600
Come along, darling.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.120
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.360
[Margaret] No, Blinkie, no kissing. Germs!

19:16.760 --> 19:18.240
[coughs]

19:18.320 --> 19:20.640
[Tony] She's exhausted, poor thing.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.160
[groans]

19:24.240 --> 19:26.680
-I look hideous.
-[Tony] No.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.200
Ghastly.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.640
You look a bit tired.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.720
A bit coldy.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.160
It's only to be expected after your...

19:39.680 --> 19:41.040
heroics.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.440
You hated every minute, didn't you?

19:44.520 --> 19:45.800
Maybe.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.200
But that's irrelevant.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.920
The newspapers didn't.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.800
Page after page
about how extraordinary you were,

19:57.320 --> 19:59.840
what an asset to the Crown,
how underused you are,

19:59.920 --> 20:03.360
what a secret weapon,
how deserving you are of the spotlight.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.880
-Your elder sister eclipsed and outshone.
-Darling.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.600
-And now you must sleep.
-Hmm? What will you do?

20:12.800 --> 20:14.840
Be a good guest and sing for our supper.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.440
-So rest.
-I will.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.720
And get well for New York.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.960
[door opens]

20:28.360 --> 20:29.360
[door closes]

20:35.360 --> 20:38.600
[Watson] Mr. President, I just got off
the phone with our ambassador in London,

20:38.680 --> 20:40.680
who just got off the phone
with the Prime Minister,

20:40.760 --> 20:44.160
-who got off the phone with the Queen.
-Don't tell me, everybody's pissed.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.560
The general view seems to be

20:46.640 --> 20:49.080
that if you have a quarrel
with the Prime Minister,

20:49.160 --> 20:52.000
that's one thing,
but no one gets to insult the Crown, sir.

20:52.080 --> 20:55.040
-[urinates]
-It's like, uh, treason or something.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.360
How have I insulted the Crown?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.640
By not accepting
the Queen's invitation, sir.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.680
Well, I didn't refuse.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.560
I just haven't replied.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.760
Well, now, don't you do this, Marvin.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.920
You're my Chief of Staff,
you're supposed to have my back.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.400
Don't you get suckered into this.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.280
You know, they got this
whole thing going on over there,

21:16.360 --> 21:19.200
Head of State, Prime Minister,
Buckingham Palace,

21:19.280 --> 21:22.480
Downing Street, it's like a double act,
like tag-team wrestling.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.040
One of 'em gets in trouble,
the other jumps in to bail 'em out.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.320
Wilson screws me over Vietnam,

21:28.400 --> 21:32.080
and she jumps in to make it all good
with some bird-shoot bullshit.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.640
We don't have that here.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.480
[Watson] No, sir.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.640
[zips up fly]

21:38.720 --> 21:40.120
The buck stops with me.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.880
Who the hell am I supposed to call

21:42.960 --> 21:45.520
if I want to issue an invitation
to get me out of trouble?

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
[Watson] Well, you call me, sir,
your oldest friend.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.840
I'd come up with a sensible plan
to get us all out of trouble.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.240
All right. Come up with a plan.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.240
Well, sir, I just did.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.280
This is the plan, right here.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.160
Who in God's name is that?

22:05.080 --> 22:07.080
[man on TV]
They came to land at Oakland Airport,

22:07.160 --> 22:09.120
and here, as in San Francisco,

22:09.200 --> 22:11.560
crowds met and cheered them
everywhere they went.

22:12.680 --> 22:15.320
The Princess was radiant,
obviously enjoying herself.

22:15.800 --> 22:20.000
It wasn't long before her sparkle cast
an informal atmosphere over the occasion.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.080
The American people and their press
have warmed to the couple,

22:24.160 --> 22:27.960
enchanted by the natural display
of charm and friendliness.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.560
Prime Minister for you, ma'am.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.040
Said it was urgent.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.480
Prime Minister?

22:37.720 --> 22:42.880
[Wilson] Just to say, we've finally had
a response from the Americans, ma'am.

22:43.920 --> 22:47.440
They've come back
with an invitation of their own.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.000
To dinner at the White House.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.840
-For me?
-No, for Princess Margaret.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.000
-Oh, that's cunning.
-Uh, yes.

22:57.080 --> 23:00.280
That way, President Johnson
can't be accused of snubbing my offer.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.560
No.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.480
It also side-steps
the all-important issue of the bailout.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.320
Indeed.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.320
But we think not all is lost,

23:10.400 --> 23:12.720
that Princess Margaret should
accept the invitation,

23:12.800 --> 23:14.480
go to the White House,

23:14.760 --> 23:16.640
and use the occasion

23:16.720 --> 23:20.320
to win over hearts and minds
to the British cause.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.120
It would be a political engagement
of the utmost delicacy.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.360
For which you want
to send Princess Margaret?

23:29.800 --> 23:31.680
Yes, well, that had been my reaction.

23:32.600 --> 23:36.440
But her trip to America has been
a terrific success.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
So I gather.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.360
So, will you ask her?

23:44.880 --> 23:46.400
If those are my instructions.

23:48.880 --> 23:49.800
Please.

23:54.680 --> 23:55.600
Well, well.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.720
I suppose the situation is so dire,
there's really nothing to lose.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.200
He doesn't know my sister.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.680
[Charteris] Hmm.

24:05.000 --> 24:05.920
Ma'am.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.560
-[knocking at door]
-[door opens]

24:10.640 --> 24:11.720
[Margaret] No!

24:15.480 --> 24:18.120
-[Blinkie] Your Royal Highness?
-No!

24:18.200 --> 24:20.240
-[Blinkie] Telephone for you.
-No!

24:20.560 --> 24:21.840
[Blinkie] It's the Queen.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.680
[sighs]

24:27.760 --> 24:28.880
[groans]

24:35.040 --> 24:37.240
-[lighter clicks]
-Hello, you.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.120
Hello, you.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.440
Sorry to disturb.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.120
I know you're on holiday,
so you won't want to hear this.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.400
What?

24:45.480 --> 24:48.280
We've had an invitation
from the White House

24:48.360 --> 24:49.760
for you to go to Washington

24:49.840 --> 24:52.320
and have dinner with the President
and the First Lady,

24:52.400 --> 24:53.600
and we'd like you to attend.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.600
-When?
-This Wednesday.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.680
Oh. Can't.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.240
Why not?

25:02.960 --> 25:04.520
I'm going to be in New York.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.360
For Tony's book launch.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.240
Perhaps I should make it clear.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.680
There is rather a lot riding on it,

25:12.760 --> 25:15.760
and everyone is keen, very keen,
for you to go.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.240
Perhaps I should make it clear

25:18.320 --> 25:21.440
that nothing is going to stop me
from supporting my husband,

25:21.520 --> 25:22.960
just like you asked me to.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.200
-[dial tone]
-Margaret!

26:04.600 --> 26:05.920
[Elizabeth] "Dear Margaret,

26:06.400 --> 26:09.720
as a wife, I understand your desire
to support Tony.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.720
You know that it was my honest hope

26:11.800 --> 26:14.840
that on this trip
you would both find the opportunity

26:14.920 --> 26:16.520
to be more courteous,

26:16.600 --> 26:18.880
more encouraging to each other.

26:18.960 --> 26:22.160
But for now,
such considerations must be put aside.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.680
I have asked you this once as a sister,

26:26.280 --> 26:29.640
and now I must command it
as your Queen."

26:32.080 --> 26:35.600
Your Royal Highness. Sir.
Thank you so much for agreeing to this.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.120
The most recent list
of people attending the dinner,

26:40.200 --> 26:43.200
with some brief biographies
of those expected to sit close to you.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.920
[Elizabeth] "What I'm asking you to do

26:46.000 --> 26:49.360
amounts to much more
than simply attending a dinner.

26:53.560 --> 26:58.200
Currently, there are matters pertaining
to this country's future prosperity

26:58.800 --> 27:02.200
that require a concerted effort
on our part.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.240
We must heal the divisions
that are emerging

27:05.320 --> 27:08.320
between Britain and its American cousins.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.400
You've often lamented
that you have nothing to do,

27:12.080 --> 27:13.920
that you are a wasted resource.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.960
Well, the task you are embarking on today
could not be more crucial.

27:19.320 --> 27:24.160
Britain currently has a deficit
of £800 million.

27:24.600 --> 27:29.240
What we need is a bailout
of at least £1,000 million.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.880
Only the Americans can give it to us.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.320
I know you like
to do things your own way.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.160
But this is a diplomatic mission
of the highest sensitivity.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.480
And I would urge you, for once,

27:49.840 --> 27:51.840
to play things by the book."

27:52.720 --> 27:53.640
Ready?

27:54.880 --> 27:56.640
[Margaret] What happens if I fail?

27:56.960 --> 27:58.640
If we don't get the bailout?

28:00.040 --> 28:02.800
Then we break our promises to the IMF,

28:03.400 --> 28:05.880
exhaust the credit facilities
available to us,

28:05.960 --> 28:07.040
face a run on sterling,

28:08.240 --> 28:12.040
and the government would be left with
no option but to devalue the pound.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.160
Hm-hmm. And that's bad?

28:14.560 --> 28:15.560
Devaluation?

28:16.040 --> 28:17.520
It's worse than bad.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.840
It would relegate sterling to the
second division of the world's currencies

28:20.920 --> 28:23.480
and Britain to the third division
of the world's economies.

28:25.080 --> 28:29.360
It would mean international humiliation,
political ignominy, and...

28:31.120 --> 28:32.360
financial ruin.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.080
Your Royal Highness.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.440
President Johnson.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.920
["God Save the Queen" playing]

29:21.800 --> 29:23.920
-Good morning, Prime Minister.
-Good morning.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.400
[Wilson] I've had an opportunity now

29:27.480 --> 29:32.600
to speak to our ambassador in Washington
about the White House dinner last night.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.800
And?

29:34.640 --> 29:35.480
I...

29:36.560 --> 29:38.040
I don't know where to begin.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.680
It seemed the first course
had barely been served

29:43.760 --> 29:47.560
before Princess Margaret made remarks
about the late President Kennedy

29:47.640 --> 29:48.640
that were...

29:49.240 --> 29:50.600
less than discreet.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.280
I met him once. Kennedy.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.520
I was left distinctly...

29:57.200 --> 29:58.280
underwhelmed.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.440
[guests fall silent]

30:01.400 --> 30:02.480
Margaret.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.320
[Margaret]
I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?

30:05.400 --> 30:08.200
I do know these days one's not allowed

30:08.280 --> 30:13.200
to think anything other than
what a great statesman Kennedy was.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.080
-Say nothing, Lyndon.
-[Margaret] Of course he'll say nothing.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.440
He was his loyal deputy.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.600
Which I think I can understand
better than most.

30:21.680 --> 30:25.400
The frustrations and resentments
that can build up

30:26.000 --> 30:27.680
from a life as a number two.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.000
The support act.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.040
Even of someone you adore.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.440
You spent three years as Vice President.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.600
I've spent my whole life as Vice Queen.

30:43.840 --> 30:48.520
Except that came out wrong,
I didn't mean I'm a... "vice queen."

30:48.600 --> 30:51.120
Is there a strategy in place
to deal with the fallout?

30:51.560 --> 30:53.160
Oh, no. There's no fallout.

30:53.920 --> 30:54.840
What?

30:54.920 --> 30:58.040
President Johnson agreed.
Thoroughly. Enthusiastically.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.480
Unreservedly.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.880
He said, um, if I remember rightly,

31:03.800 --> 31:05.080
"Jack Kennedy..."

31:05.160 --> 31:07.040
...would've killed his own mother

31:07.120 --> 31:11.240
just to take the skin off her ass
to make a drum to beat his own praises.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.760
[laughter]

31:19.160 --> 31:20.120
Right?

31:20.440 --> 31:21.440
I see.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.080
This then led to a drinking contest.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.200
-What?
-[Margaret] Last man standing

31:28.280 --> 31:30.360
-is the winner.
-Challenge accepted!

31:30.440 --> 31:32.640
[Wilson] Which, in turn,
led to a limerick contest.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.200
-Limericks?
-Yes, ma'am.

31:35.240 --> 31:38.560
Some of them, I'm afraid to say,
a little off-color.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.360
Hmm.

31:40.680 --> 31:41.960
Well, go on then.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.520
Oh, right... Um... [clears throat]

31:46.360 --> 31:49.040
Well, the first one went a little...

31:51.680 --> 31:53.800
"There was a young woman from Delaware..."

31:53.880 --> 31:57.120
Who liked to make love...

31:58.400 --> 31:59.560
liked to make love...

31:59.640 --> 32:01.840
-Delaware! Delaware!
-...in her underwear.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.960
-[Margaret] A terrible prude...
-[Wilson] "She would never go nude,

32:05.720 --> 32:08.600
And her bum, hips, and tits
she would never bare."

32:08.680 --> 32:10.120
[raucous laughter]

32:13.440 --> 32:14.440
What else?

32:14.520 --> 32:16.640
The President countered with,

32:16.720 --> 32:18.720
"There was a young man from Wisconsin

32:18.800 --> 32:21.040
Who was blessed
with an enormously large..."

32:21.120 --> 32:23.320
-...Johnson!
-[raucous laughter]

32:25.520 --> 32:26.520
Where's the rest of it?

32:26.600 --> 32:30.840
I believe everyone thought
that was long enough. As it were.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.440
Any more?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.600
Princess Margaret won the evening
with this one...

32:37.400 --> 32:39.960
"There was a young lady from Dallas,

32:40.480 --> 32:43.080
Who used a dynamite stick as a phallus..."

32:44.480 --> 32:45.560
They found her...

32:48.560 --> 32:50.280
You've made it this far.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.040
"They found her vagina
in North Carolina..."

32:55.120 --> 32:56.880
And her arsehole in Buckingham Palace.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.040
[raucous laughter]

33:01.720 --> 33:02.880
Bravo.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.720
["Coming Home Baby" playing]

33:09.320 --> 33:11.680
Then, apparently, there was dancing.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.080
Whoo!

33:34.720 --> 33:36.400
Followed by singing.

at four in the morning,

having agreed to the bailout,

34:09.280 --> 34:10.880
All the things I could never be.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.480

Well, of those two,

34:27.640 --> 34:30.600
I would pick dependability
every day of the week.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.320
Thank you.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.160
But it would be nice
to be dazzling on occasion, too.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.800
-You are dazzling.
-Hmm.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.800

Thank you, sir.

-[Elizabeth] Hail the conquering heroine!
-Ah, yes.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.400
Let the abuse begin.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.080
[Elizabeth] Now, you must know by now

36:19.160 --> 36:21.440
any triumph from this family is met
with a healthy dose of--

36:21.520 --> 36:23.720
-Envy? Spite?
-Good-natured teasing

36:23.800 --> 36:25.320
to keep one's feet on the ground.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.600
Everyone's very grateful.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.440
The Prime Minister said he was
going to write to you personally.

36:30.520 --> 36:33.080
Better than that.
He met me at the airport.

36:34.040 --> 36:34.880
Ah.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.240
And now we're all racking our brains

36:37.320 --> 36:39.200
as to what to give you
to show our appreciation.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.240
How would you feel
about the Order of Merit?

36:44.680 --> 36:46.040
Or the Victorian Chain?

36:47.360 --> 36:49.600
You can keep your gongs and your bongs

36:49.680 --> 36:51.320
for all the men
to whom it matters so much.

36:52.640 --> 36:56.000
But I'd be lying if I didn't admit
to having done a little thinking,

36:56.400 --> 36:58.360
in view of how well it all went...

36:59.480 --> 37:02.120
about us doing it more often.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.800
Doing what?

37:05.840 --> 37:07.280
Sharing duties.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.840
But we didn't share duties.
You just went to a dinner party.

37:12.520 --> 37:13.800
In your place.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.320
And represented Crown and country

37:17.400 --> 37:21.440
with, I think we can agree,
favorable results.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.880
Isn't it possible
that we've stumbled upon something here?

37:28.600 --> 37:32.080
You have far too much to do,
far too much pressure,

37:32.160 --> 37:33.600
far too much responsibility.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.240
And I, too little.

37:36.760 --> 37:40.640
Having no role, having nothing to do is...

37:41.840 --> 37:42.960
soul-destroying.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.800
All I am asking is if you were prepared
to share a little more.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.640
For both our sakes.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.560
Let me think about it.

38:05.720 --> 38:06.920
I'll see what I can do.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.440
[chuckles]

38:12.120 --> 38:14.400
-[Philip] Don't tell me you softened?
-I did.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.320
And with good reason.

38:16.960 --> 38:21.520
Margaret does suffer more than anyone else
by not having a more meaningful role.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.160
Suffers in health and happiness.

38:24.520 --> 38:25.720
She's overlooked.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.280
And in terms of ability and character

38:29.360 --> 38:33.400
and intelligence and flair,
she does not deserve to be overlooked.

38:33.800 --> 38:36.520
So, why shouldn't we consider
expanding the role,

38:36.600 --> 38:37.960
sharing the job a bit more?

38:38.560 --> 38:40.960
[Philip]
There are two answers to that question.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.760
Neither makes for pretty listening.

38:46.320 --> 38:51.240
Yes, the system is unequal
and unjust and cruel.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.840
Primogeniture divides
and destroys families,

38:54.920 --> 38:56.920
the system stinks, but...

38:57.560 --> 39:00.080
in its cruelty and injustice,
it reflects something else,

39:00.160 --> 39:02.960
which is harsh and brutal,

39:03.040 --> 39:05.720
which no one is suggesting we rearrange.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.280
Life.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.600
We all desire equality,
but here's the thing.

39:14.360 --> 39:15.960
We were not born equal.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.160
-And what's the second?
-[chuckles]

39:20.760 --> 39:22.040
Do you remember I told you once

39:22.120 --> 39:25.200
I got drunk with that
god-awful monster Tommy Lascelles?

39:25.280 --> 39:26.160
Hmm.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.240
Well, that night
he shared with me his theory

39:30.760 --> 39:32.360
about the House of Windsor.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.440
I've never repeated it to anyone since.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.320
Go on.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.360
He asked me to imagine
a mythological creature.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.960
A Reichsadler.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.080
A polycephalus, a two-headed eagle.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.520
For the purposes of this conversation,

39:52.600 --> 39:54.920
I want you to think of it
as representing us.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.280
This family.

39:58.360 --> 39:59.960
Your family.

40:01.160 --> 40:04.440
There have always been
the dazzling Windsors and the dull ones.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.000
-Your father...
-A saint.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.120
But dull. Sorry.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.120
Your grandfather, too.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.720
-George V?
-Deadly dull.

40:16.560 --> 40:19.200
At the height of the Great War,
when the...

40:19.680 --> 40:22.680
the Tsar and the Kaiser
and the Emperor of Austria

40:22.760 --> 40:24.880
were dazzling the world, where was he?

40:25.480 --> 40:27.440
He was sticking stamps in his album.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.520
-His wife--
-Queen Mary, wonderful.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.840
Ditchwater.

40:31.280 --> 40:35.440
And so it goes, through George V
to Queen Victoria and back.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.720
An uninterrupted line of stolid,

40:38.800 --> 40:39.960
turgid dreariness.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.160
Culminating in me?

40:41.240 --> 40:42.960
Well, yes, but...

40:44.480 --> 40:48.920
alongside that dull,
dutiful, reliable, heroic strain

40:49.840 --> 40:50.920
runs another.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.920
The dazzling, the brilliant,
the individualistic,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.600
and... the dangerous.

40:59.640 --> 41:04.040
And so, for every Victoria,
you get an Edward VII.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.040
For every George V, you get a Prince Eddy.

41:07.120 --> 41:10.840
For every George VI,
you get an Edward VIII.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.200
For every Lilibet...

41:15.520 --> 41:16.880
you get a Margaret.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.640
And she may have had a success
in Washington,

41:20.720 --> 41:24.200
but let's not delude ourselves
that serious diplomacy can be achieved

41:24.280 --> 41:25.680
through drinking and dancing.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.800
Let Margaret have the glory,

41:28.480 --> 41:31.880
but let's not rewrite
the constitutional rulebook

41:32.240 --> 41:33.760
because she got lucky once.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.800
And where does that leave
my relationship with her?

41:35.880 --> 41:36.960
Unchanged.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.320
You're the Queen.

41:40.120 --> 41:42.640
And she's your dangerous baby sister.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.240
She's outside.
She knows we're talking about her.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.560
Then let's join her.

41:50.680 --> 41:53.760
That feverish mind of hers
needs no encouragement.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.560
[Lascelles]
What you are suggesting is unthinkable.

42:35.640 --> 42:38.200
The order of succession to the throne
is determined

42:38.280 --> 42:40.560
by the Act of Settlement of 1701,

42:40.640 --> 42:43.120
not the wild and irresponsible whims

42:43.200 --> 42:44.600
of young princesses.

42:45.440 --> 42:49.600
The principle of undisturbed
hereditary descent is a pillar

42:49.680 --> 42:52.400
