07:03.353 --> 07:04.734
I KNEW WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.667
>> I'M SURE YOU WOULD, JUST LIKE

07:06.667 --> 07:07.910
I WOULD HAVE FELT BETTER HAD I

07:07.910 --> 07:09.187
KNOWN EVERYTHING YOU KEPT FROM

07:09.187 --> 07:15.262
ME.

07:15.262 --> 07:15.918
OH.

07:15.918 --> 07:16.574
[laughs]

07:16.574 --> 07:17.782
YOU MUST BE HANK.

07:17.782 --> 07:19.093
>> NICE TO MEET YOU, MS. GREENE.

07:19.093 --> 07:23.788
>> YOU CAN CALL ME KEISHA.

07:23.788 --> 07:26.446
BYE, MALCOLM.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.688
>> KEEP HER SAFE.

07:27.688 --> 07:31.658
>> THAT'S MY JOB.

07:31.658 --> 07:34.350
>> ♪ ONE WAY

07:34.350 --> 07:35.282
♪ BREAK MY HEART

07:35.282 --> 07:36.559
♪ BREAK, BREAK MY HEART

07:36.559 --> 07:38.078
♪ ONE WAY

07:38.078 --> 07:40.114
>> IT'S HIDEOUS.

07:40.114 --> 07:40.839
>> YOU SAID THAT ABOUT THE LAST

07:40.839 --> 07:41.495
THREE.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.979
>> NO, I SAID "REPULSIVE,"

07:42.979 --> 07:44.533
"GROTESQUE," AND "GHASTLY."

07:44.533 --> 07:46.293
THIS ONE IS HIDEOUS.

07:46.293 --> 07:47.812
>> IT'S GORGEOUS, AND IF IT FIT

07:47.812 --> 07:49.296
YOU ANY BETTER, I WOULD HAVE HAD

07:49.296 --> 07:50.400
TO HAVE SPRAYED IT ON.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.643
>> I HATE THE COLOR...

07:51.643 --> 07:52.886
>> WHITE IS ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE

07:52.886 --> 07:53.818
COLORS.

07:53.818 --> 07:54.957
>> AND THE FABRIC IS ITCHY.

07:54.957 --> 07:56.855
>> FELICIA, IT'S SILK.

07:56.855 --> 07:58.339
THE ONLY THING SOFTER IS THE

07:58.339 --> 08:00.480
SKIN ON A BABY'S BUTT, AND DON'T

08:00.480 --> 08:01.481
EVEN GO THERE.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.482
YOU'RE ALREADY IN ENOUGH TROUBLE

08:02.482 --> 08:03.793
WITH PETA.

08:03.793 --> 08:04.760
>> I'M NOT ENTHUSED, I'M NOT

08:04.760 --> 08:05.830
INTRIGUED, AND I DON'T FEEL

08:05.830 --> 08:08.073
SEXY.

08:08.073 --> 08:08.867
>> MAYBE YOU'RE JUST FEELING A

08:08.867 --> 08:09.523
LITTLE CRAMPY.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.213
>> EXCUSE ME?

08:10.213 --> 08:11.974
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

08:11.974 --> 08:13.976
>> I SAID--I SAID YOU LOOK HOT

08:13.976 --> 08:16.565
AND VAMPY.

08:16.565 --> 08:18.601
LOOK, HELP ME HELP YOU.

08:18.601 --> 08:19.947
IF I AT LEAST KNEW WHERE YOU

08:19.947 --> 08:21.155
WERE GOING, I COULD--

08:21.155 --> 08:22.294
>> IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHERE I'M

08:22.294 --> 08:23.123
GOING.

08:23.123 --> 08:24.158
YOUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I

08:24.158 --> 08:26.160
LOOK LIKE A BILLION DOLLARS.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.645
>> YES, BUT A BILLION DOLLARS'

08:27.645 --> 08:29.509
WORTH OF SEXY, OR A BILLION

08:29.509 --> 08:31.718
DOLLARS' WORTH OF LOVELY?

08:31.718 --> 08:34.237
>> OKAY, FINE.

08:34.237 --> 08:37.931
IF YOU MUST KNOW, I'M HAVING

08:37.931 --> 08:41.106
DINNER WITH MY EX-HUSBAND.

08:41.106 --> 08:44.800
>> WELL, THEN, IN THAT CASE, MAY

08:44.800 --> 08:47.596
I SUGGEST THE "YOU'LL NEVER HIT

08:47.596 --> 08:50.737
THIS AGAIN" LOOK?

08:50.737 --> 08:54.913
HMM?

08:54.913 --> 08:56.708
>> WHAT ABOUT THE SHOES?

08:56.708 --> 08:57.916
>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALREADY

08:57.916 --> 09:02.887
SITTING DOWN.

09:02.887 --> 09:05.959
SITTING DOWN.
OOH.

09:05.959 --> 09:10.860
OOH.

09:10.860 --> 09:15.658
OOH.
DON'T DROOL ON THE DRESS.

09:15.658 --> 09:17.315
DON'T DROOL ON THE DRESS.

09:17.315 --> 09:18.765
>> HEY!

09:18.765 --> 09:20.283
ANYTHING EXCITING GOING ON OVER

09:20.283 --> 09:21.388
HERE?

09:21.388 --> 09:25.565
>> UM, NOT REALLY.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.566
>> [sighs]

09:26.566 --> 09:27.705
>> HOW ABOUT YOU?

09:27.705 --> 09:29.638
>> NAH, NOTHING, REALLY, WHICH

09:29.638 --> 09:30.673
IS WHY I CAME TO SEE WHAT YOU

09:30.673 --> 09:31.881
WAS UP TO.

09:31.881 --> 09:32.986
>> OH.

09:32.986 --> 09:35.713
UM, I'M JUST DOING RESEARCH.

09:35.713 --> 09:37.542
>> HMM.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.164
RESEARCH?

09:39.164 --> 09:41.097
>> [laughs]

09:41.097 --> 09:43.859
>> "HOW TO WIN AT CHARADES"?

09:43.859 --> 09:45.964
>> YEP, I SUCK AT GAMES, AND

09:45.964 --> 09:46.896
RAQUEL IS HAVING GAME NIGHT

09:46.896 --> 09:47.690
TONIGHT.

09:47.690 --> 09:49.347
>> WELL, HOW AWESOME WOULD IT

09:49.347 --> 09:50.866
BE IF YOU KNEW SOMEONE WHO WAS

09:50.866 --> 09:52.764
A MASTER AT GAMES?

09:52.764 --> 09:53.834
[laughter]

09:53.834 --> 09:55.595
I ACCEPT CASH, CREDIT CARD,

09:55.595 --> 09:56.354
OR CASHIER'S CHECK.

09:56.354 --> 09:58.183
I DO NOT PLAY FOR FREE.

09:58.183 --> 10:01.152
OR YOU CAN PAY ME WITH FLESH.

10:01.152 --> 10:02.981
>> HMM. YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

10:02.981 --> 10:03.948
>> ALL RIGHT.

10:03.948 --> 10:09.712
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO WIN OR NOT?

10:09.712 --> 10:11.265
>> OKAY, PICK ME UP AT 7:30.

10:11.265 --> 10:14.683
>> OKAY, PICK ME UP AT 7:30.
>> I THOUGHT SO.

10:14.683 --> 10:19.619
>> I THOUGHT SO.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.481
>> HEY, MAN.

10:20.481 --> 10:21.275
>> HOW YOU DOING?

10:21.275 --> 10:22.035
>> THANKS FOR COMING.

10:22.035 --> 10:23.208
>> MY PLEASURE.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.072
SEEMED URGENT.

10:25.072 --> 10:26.660
>> IT IS, LUKE.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.558
IT IS.

10:28.558 --> 10:29.974
>> HOW SO?

10:29.974 --> 10:32.045
>> I NEED TO CALL IN THAT IOU.

10:32.045 --> 10:33.046
>> ANYTIME.

10:33.046 --> 10:34.323
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, YOU SAVED MY

10:34.323 --> 10:35.842
ASS BACK IN THE DAY.

10:35.842 --> 10:36.981
>> YOU STILL GOT THOSE JUDGES IN

10:36.981 --> 10:37.947
YOUR BACK POCKET?

10:37.947 --> 10:39.777
>> AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.

10:39.777 --> 10:41.571
JUST GOT A NEW ONE THE OTHER

10:41.571 --> 10:42.503
DAY.

10:42.503 --> 10:43.815
LUCKY FOR US, THEY WERE HIT BY

10:43.815 --> 10:44.885
THE RECESSION JUST LIKE EVERYONE

10:44.885 --> 10:45.575
ELSE.

10:45.575 --> 10:46.576
>> [laughing]

10:46.576 --> 10:47.647
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.578
>> YEAH.

10:48.578 --> 10:51.029
>> IT'S VERY GOOD TO KNOW.

10:51.029 --> 10:52.306
I ALSO KNOW YOU GOT DEACON'S

10:52.306 --> 10:53.583
EAR, RIGHT?

10:53.583 --> 10:54.999
HE CROSSED THE LINE WITH ME, AND

10:54.999 --> 10:55.862
I'M GOING TO NEED TO PULL HIM

10:55.862 --> 10:57.726
BACK.

10:57.726 --> 11:00.280
>> I HAVE MORE THAN HIS EAR, BUT

11:00.280 --> 11:01.591
WHAT HAS THAT FOOL GONE AND DONE

11:01.591 --> 11:02.662
WHAT HAS THAT FOOL GONE AND DONE
NOW?

11:02.662 --> 11:15.191
NOW?

11:15.191 --> 11:17.435
>> HA, WHAT IS ALL THIS?

11:17.435 --> 11:18.712
>> GOING ALL MARTHA STEWART

11:18.712 --> 11:19.679
HELPS ME TAKE MY MIND OFF

11:19.679 --> 11:20.680
THINGS.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.646
>> OH.

11:21.646 --> 11:22.578
HEY, KEISHA'LL BE HERE IN A

11:22.578 --> 11:23.475
MINUTE.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.269
MAYBE I SHOULD HEAD OUT BEFORE

11:24.269 --> 11:25.063
SHE GETS HERE.

11:25.063 --> 11:25.961
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STAY?

11:25.961 --> 11:26.962
>> I WAS, BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING

11:26.962 --> 11:28.273
TO EXPLAIN ME ALREADY BEING HERE

11:28.273 --> 11:29.378
WHEN SHE GETS HERE?

11:29.378 --> 11:31.035
>> WELL, I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT

11:31.035 --> 11:32.726
I SENT YOU OUT FOR EXTRA DRINKS.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.003
>> HMM, YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD AT

11:34.003 --> 11:35.902
MAKING UP LIES ON THE FLY.

11:35.902 --> 11:37.144
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

11:37.144 --> 11:39.422
>> NO, SILLY.

11:39.422 --> 11:41.045
I JUST HAD VERY STRICT PARENTS,

11:41.045 --> 11:42.218
AND I LEARNED TO BECOME CREATIVE

11:42.218 --> 11:43.737
AT A VERY YOUNG AGE.

11:43.737 --> 11:44.704
>> REALLY?

11:44.704 --> 11:45.670
HOW YOUNG?

11:45.670 --> 11:47.154
[laughter]

11:47.154 --> 11:47.948
[doorbell]

11:47.948 --> 11:49.432
>> [gasps]

11:49.432 --> 11:50.261
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

11:50.261 --> 11:51.089
>> DON'T...

11:51.089 --> 11:55.162
[grunts]

11:55.162 --> 11:58.994
>> GIRL, GET IN HERE.

11:58.994 --> 12:00.996
UH, WHO'S THE GOOD-LOOKING SUIT?

12:00.996 --> 12:03.619
>> [laughs] BODYGUARD.

12:03.619 --> 12:05.000
[sighs]

12:05.000 --> 12:06.829
>> IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:06.829 --> 12:09.038
>> YOU TOO, GIRL.

12:09.038 --> 12:10.177
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

12:10.177 --> 12:11.040
>> OF COURSE.

12:11.040 --> 12:11.869
YOU KNOW IF I WASN'T, I WOULD

12:11.869 --> 12:12.697
TELL YOU.

12:12.697 --> 12:13.491
>> YES.

12:13.491 --> 12:14.561
YES, YOU WOULD, BECAUSE YOU'VE

12:14.561 --> 12:16.528
ALWAYS BEEN STRAIGHT WITH ME,

12:16.528 --> 12:19.221
UNLIKE OTHERS IN MY LIFE.

12:19.221 --> 12:21.154
OH, HELLO, TERRENCE.

12:21.154 --> 12:23.156
>> WHAT'S UP, KEISHA?

12:23.156 --> 12:24.053
WHAT?

12:24.053 --> 12:24.813
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

12:24.813 --> 12:25.745
I'M NOT THE ONE THAT LIED TO

12:25.745 --> 12:26.573
YOU.

12:26.573 --> 12:27.850
>> YOUR BROTHER'S ANOTHER STORY.

12:27.850 --> 12:29.127
YOU'RE HERE EARLY.

12:29.127 --> 12:29.990
>> OH, I NEEDED HIM TO GO GET

12:29.990 --> 12:31.336
SOME DRINKS.

12:31.336 --> 12:32.372
YEAH, BUT YOU FORGOT THE BEER,

12:32.372 --> 12:33.200
SO, UM...

12:33.200 --> 12:34.029
>> YEAH.

12:34.029 --> 12:34.823
>> YEAH, YOU SHOULD GO PROBABLY

12:34.823 --> 12:35.616
DO THAT.

12:35.616 --> 12:36.376
>> YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

12:36.376 --> 12:39.931
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GO.

12:39.931 --> 12:41.105
>> [sighs]

12:41.105 --> 12:42.175
LOOK, I WANTED TO GET OUT OF

12:42.175 --> 12:43.970
THE HOUSE TONIGHT, BUT I DON'T

12:43.970 --> 12:45.765
THINK I'M UP TO PLAYING GAMES.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.939
I MEAN, I'LL BE HERE, BUT...

12:47.939 --> 12:49.044
YOU KNOW?

12:49.044 --> 12:50.114
>> I HEAR YOU.

12:50.114 --> 12:51.736
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU AND MALCOLM?

12:51.736 --> 12:52.875
>> OH, I CAN'T EVEN GET INTO ALL

12:52.875 --> 12:54.290
OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.845
I'M SO TIRED OF FIGHTING WITH

12:56.845 --> 12:58.881
HIM, ALTHOUGH I DID BRING ONE OF

12:58.881 --> 13:00.780
HIS INSANELY EXPENSIVE BOTTLES

13:00.780 --> 13:01.988
OF WINE.

13:01.988 --> 13:02.885
>> [gasps]

13:02.885 --> 13:04.266
KEISHA!

13:04.266 --> 13:06.061
THAT SAYS "1945."

13:06.061 --> 13:07.027
>> YEAH, OKAY.

13:07.027 --> 13:08.028
I KNOW.

13:08.028 --> 13:09.305
HE WAS SAVING IT FOR A SPECIAL

13:09.305 --> 13:10.755
OCCASION.

13:10.755 --> 13:14.000
YEAH, I THINK THIS QUALIFIES.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.794
>> OH.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.243
>> YEAH.

13:16.243 --> 13:17.382
[sighs]

13:17.382 --> 13:20.282
[sighs]
>> OKAY.

13:20.282 --> 13:21.939
>> OKAY.

13:21.939 --> 13:23.319
>> THAT WAS AN EXTREMELY BOLD

13:23.319 --> 13:25.321
MOVE ON HIS BEHALF, EVEN FOR

13:25.321 --> 13:26.357
DEACON.

13:26.357 --> 13:27.323
HE MUST BE MORE DESPERATE THAN I

13:27.323 --> 13:28.221
THOUGHT.

13:28.221 --> 13:29.498
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:29.498 --> 13:31.293
>> HE'S BROKE, MALCOLM.

13:31.293 --> 13:32.121
>> WHAT?

13:32.121 --> 13:33.157
[laughs]

13:33.157 --> 13:34.675
>> HE'S INTO ME FOR...

13:34.675 --> 13:37.057
PSHH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

13:37.057 --> 13:38.196
I'D HAVE TO CALL MY ACCOUNTANT

13:38.196 --> 13:39.542
FOR THE TRUE FIGURES.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.854
>> WAIT A MINUTE, I THOUGHT

13:40.854 --> 13:42.097
DEACON GOT YOU STARTED.

13:42.097 --> 13:42.925
I MEAN, I THOUGHT HE GAVE YOU

13:42.925 --> 13:43.961
MONEY.

13:43.961 --> 13:44.996
LISTEN, LUKE, DEACON IS ALWAYS

13:44.996 --> 13:46.308
GOING ON AND ON ABOUT HOW YOU'RE

13:46.308 --> 13:47.412
HIS PROTEGE.

13:47.412 --> 13:48.310
>> [laughing]

13:48.310 --> 13:49.829
PROTEGE, MY ASS.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.864
WHILE HE WAS OUT ON GOLF

13:50.864 --> 13:52.072
COURSES BEING BOUGIE, I HAD TO

13:52.072 --> 13:53.902
HOLD DOWN THE HUSTLE, WHICH IS

13:53.902 --> 13:57.112
WHY I NOW OWN HIS ASS, AND

13:57.112 --> 13:58.838
PROBABLY WHY HE'S LEANING ON YOU

13:58.838 --> 14:00.598
SO HEAVY.

14:00.598 --> 14:01.910
>> I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT FOOL IS

14:01.910 --> 14:03.221
BROKE.

14:03.221 --> 14:04.498
I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS BEING A

14:04.498 --> 14:05.983
GREEDY BASTARD.

14:05.983 --> 14:07.225
>> OH, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT,

14:07.225 --> 14:08.848
HE IS A GREEDY BASTARD.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.056
