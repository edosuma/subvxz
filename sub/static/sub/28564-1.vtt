01:37.131 --> 01:39.798
What can you
say about a crazy world?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.533
A crazy world since time began.

01:42.837 --> 01:44.736
If you wanna believe
the good book it says

01:44.738 --> 01:47.206
crazy began with Adam and Eve.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.475
Followed by Kane versus Abel.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.343
Sins crouching at the door.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.280
Kane lures his brother,
kills him in the field.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.950
Don't know what's so good

01:57.951 --> 01:59.351
about a book with
stories like that.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.154
It's not so much what you say

02:02.155 --> 02:03.888
about this crazy
world, or what you do.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.491
Come in.

02:52.540 --> 02:56.808
Your angel door
knocker is so beautiful.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.545
I feel better already.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.947
Yes, every door
should have one.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.416
Can I help you, miss?

03:04.418 --> 03:05.418
If you dare.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.359
Come on, Doctor.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.537
Doctor, by the smell of things,

03:25.539 --> 03:27.673
I can see that it's
your lunch hour.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.643
But if you could please give
me the hour of your time.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.946
I really need it.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.548
That is highly
irregular, Jane,

03:36.550 --> 03:38.984
I'm not familiar
with your history.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.652
Please.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.921
I don't wanna hurt myself.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.457
Or anybody else.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.348
If you insist.

04:23.497 --> 04:27.699
So this is the shrink lab
where the sick are reborn.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.471
Sad, really.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.850
Thank you so much for
seeing me, Doctor.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.519
You're saving my life.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.359
Should I lie?

04:56.530 --> 04:58.463
Or should I sit?

05:02.202 --> 05:04.736
There are no rules,
Jane, just be comfortable.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.379
Christina said that
you knew her soul

05:15.749 --> 05:18.817
and nobody else could get
into her the way that you did.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.823
How did you get
into her like that?

05:27.795 --> 05:28.827
I didn't.

05:31.899 --> 05:32.831
It was all just...

05:32.833 --> 05:34.533
You, you did.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.503
How do you get into
anybody like that?

05:40.107 --> 05:43.108
Tell me, Doctor,
what's your secret?

05:44.511 --> 05:48.847
Well, I acutely
investigate what's deeply

05:48.849 --> 05:52.718
bothering my patient and
use interesting tools

05:52.720 --> 05:55.554
to help that patient
free of that bother.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.722
All in an hour.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.109
Well, yes.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.527
Once I win over their
goodwill it's over in an hour.

06:04.998 --> 06:10.135
Well, I guess I better shut
up and let you get started.

06:14.742 --> 06:18.410
We're gonna start by me
giving you some suggestions

06:18.412 --> 06:25.550
to put you into an imaginative
role enactment mental state.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.819
Are you talking
about hypnosis?

06:29.022 --> 06:31.757
You know, Doctor,
you're freaking me out.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.695
All hypnosis really
is is self-hypnosis.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.899
I just help you put
yourself into a progressive

06:40.901 --> 06:44.703
relaxation state of heightened
suggestibility, that's all.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.907
So please, lean back and relax.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.652
Now, look into the
cuckoo hologram,

07:02.122 --> 07:05.524
nothing but the hologram.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.528
Very good.

07:10.464 --> 07:13.465
Now with every word I say to you

07:13.467 --> 07:17.769
you will become more
and more relaxed.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.140
Good.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.010
First your pupils will contract.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.548
Good, perfect.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.684
Then they will dilate.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.655
Excellent.

07:36.824 --> 07:40.225
Now they will assume
a wavy motion.

07:45.499 --> 07:50.035
And as I move the hologram
closer to your eyes,

07:50.037 --> 07:57.175
the lids will get very
very heavy and close.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.051
Excellent.

08:12.593 --> 08:17.262
Now, Jane, take this
pencil and rub it over

08:18.665 --> 08:23.702
the textured surface and
interpret the phantom image.

08:36.950 --> 08:42.020
This is known as
Paranoid Critical Method.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.992
The mind will evoke
unconscious acts.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.232
Now, Jane, put the
pencil down and tell

08:54.234 --> 08:56.234
me what you see
that bothers you.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.307
I see you.

09:14.922 --> 09:18.623
Tell me what you see
that bothers you about me.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.061
I see your suffering.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.899
I need to end it.

09:28.936 --> 09:29.936
Excuse me?

09:37.744 --> 09:38.744
To be...

09:43.650 --> 09:44.816
or not to be.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.757
Interesting.

09:53.894 --> 09:58.663
Jane, tell me, how do you
feel about your sexuality?

10:02.235 --> 10:05.837
How do you feel about
my sexuality, Doctor?

10:17.918 --> 10:19.718
Does this excite you?

10:21.722 --> 10:22.722
Um.

10:23.690 --> 10:24.690
Jane.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.993
Do you hear that music?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.931
It's our hearts
pounding in desire.

10:35.869 --> 10:42.007
My precious caress is
more savory than honey.

10:44.411 --> 10:48.279
My warm lustful
body touching yours.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.421
Seems like a dream, but is it?

11:02.262 --> 11:03.262
Um.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.706
Feel the raging blood
pumping into my bosom.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.277
Filling it, perky.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.713
And firm, soft, and hard.

11:25.052 --> 11:30.188
Erotically filling my
veins wayward down lower.

11:33.727 --> 11:37.062
Down into my trembling thighs.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.165
Down into every man's
greatest desire.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.302
A desire to do
something forbidden.

11:48.875 --> 11:52.077
Something forbidden
to stop the pain.

12:00.153 --> 12:05.023
The need is so strong
it is hypnotizing.

12:07.961 --> 12:14.099
Yearning to surrender
to become one with me.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.835
To stroke my wounds.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.909
The yearning is so great.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.950
The yearning to surrender
to become one with me.

12:43.396 --> 12:47.465
To die, to save no more.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.402
For in that dream
what's they make 'em.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.394
Wait.

13:24.037 --> 13:28.139
For in that sleep of
death, dreams will come.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.483
How do you think you got me?

14:12.485 --> 14:13.484
What?

14:50.991 --> 14:54.592
When we have shuffled
off this mortal coil.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.470
Must give us pause.

15:44.511 --> 15:45.511
Hoo!

17:12.732 --> 17:13.798
Yes, hello, police?

17:13.800 --> 17:19.069
Yes, it would seem like I
have a dead body in my office.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.073
Yeah, I would appreciate
it if you could

17:22.075 --> 17:23.674
send someone to take care of it.

17:25.678 --> 17:26.810
Thank you kindly.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.113
Hey!

18:19.114 --> 18:20.797
I told you to calm down.
- It's a free country, man.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.567
Yeah, so is jail, pal.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.569
Come on.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.538
Hey, what did I say?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.474
You don't me to
hurt you, do you?

18:31.344 --> 18:32.610
Poor Claire.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.747
You must remember,
technically Dominican Order,

18:37.750 --> 18:40.218
or if you're up for the
pun, Helms of the Lord.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.423
Either way, I'm the poor
poor cloistered nun.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.326
Quickly, come in.

18:57.753 --> 18:59.336
I have left the papal
enclosure of the monastery

18:59.339 --> 19:01.839
for my medical emergency.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.377
My appointment with
the big placebo.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.181
God.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.784
That is a big cross.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.457
Better to remind me of my
lord when my thoughts stray.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.263
Please, follow me.

19:32.906 --> 19:33.906
Have a seat.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.881
Ingenuity of the past.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.586
See, this is an ancient
Chinese candle clock.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.629
As it burns down in
10 minute intervals,

19:58.631 --> 20:01.632
the weights fall into
the sounding plate below

20:02.502 --> 20:05.770
notifying me of time left.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.510
The final weight
at the hour's end

20:12.512 --> 20:15.580
pings distinctly as
if a lovely lullaby.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.998
Um, I feel a
little uncomfortable.

20:35.868 --> 20:39.270
Would you mind if I
remove my wet wimple?

20:52.018 --> 20:53.584
Are you comfortable now?

20:56.489 --> 20:58.322
I'm dead to the world.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.844
My five years spent as a novice

21:02.845 --> 21:04.962
deemed me ready by the
abest to join the monastery.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.334
I've accepted, secretly
hiding a skeptical heart.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.572
My solemn vow is to
the spiritual life

21:14.574 --> 21:18.476
but it's left me with more
questions than answers.

21:19.746 --> 21:20.746
For instance?

21:21.981 --> 21:23.014
Why am I here?

21:24.384 --> 21:25.550
'Cause you wanna be here.

21:25.551 --> 21:26.717
I mean, why is anybody here?

21:26.719 --> 21:27.719
What's the point?

21:29.856 --> 21:32.657
So religion hasn't given
you the answers you need.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.393
I'm sorry to say, no.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.995
Loved ones die and then they
leave us behind to mourn.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.930
What great plan is that?

21:40.667 --> 21:42.233
I don't understand it.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.800
I mean, I'd rather
not exist than to have

21:43.803 --> 21:46.370
this understanding
of not understanding.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.472
It's just too painful.

21:50.476 --> 21:55.346
So you have any
enjoyment in life at all?

21:55.348 --> 21:59.350
Split seconds don't erase
history nor stop the future.

22:01.888 --> 22:05.656
I dare to venture
into the taboo land

22:05.658 --> 22:08.492
of blasphemy to
whisper my doubts.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.764
Maybe there is no God.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.568
Oh God, I said it.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.905
Maybe it's only imagination,

22:20.906 --> 22:22.840
that we urgently try to
fill the darkness with.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.711
I don't know.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.582
There are believers
who would argue

22:31.584 --> 22:33.584
that you are
clinically depressed

22:33.586 --> 22:36.520
and not open to any
divine surrounding you.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.391
And you say?

22:40.393 --> 22:43.527
Boltzmann brain paradox
leans on your shoulders

22:43.529 --> 22:45.696
as you face your abyss.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.997
Self-awareness, more likely,

22:46.999 --> 22:48.866
to have formed
out of chaos, huh?

22:50.103 --> 22:54.472
Facing my alter ego Atlas,
supporting the heavens.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.407
So you're the
doctor, which am I?

22:58.678 --> 23:02.947
Dogma only knows the lie,
philosophy goes both directions.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.448
No philosophy.

23:04.450 --> 23:09.086
When I die, I'm dead and I'm
not coming back to argue.

23:27.840 --> 23:32.843
I guess my imaginary god doesn't
like me talking that way.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.749
See, why must I wear this cross?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.918
What have I been
saying, what am I doing?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.621
I am tortured by his torture

23:43.623 --> 23:45.890
and my eternal pain
knows my own soul

23:45.892 --> 23:48.058
by I can not feel him back.

23:49.462 --> 23:51.595
I cannot touch the
warmth of his skin.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.799
To have him hold me.

23:54.801 --> 23:57.668
Only to feel the
cold prickly brass

23:57.670 --> 24:00.037
that this really
breeds not enough.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.907
It's not enough.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.809
I feel really hot.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.144
I feel like, I feel
like I'm suffocating.

24:32.805 --> 24:33.805
Please.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.074
Help me.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.572
Please help me.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.880
Hold me.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.215
Please.

25:18.951 --> 25:19.951
Hold me.

25:21.821 --> 25:25.089
I need to feel the
tangible love of man

25:25.091 --> 25:28.092
and not just a symbol of a man.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.094
Please.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.963
Please lay me down.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.698
Make me feel real.

25:43.042 --> 25:47.311
Make love to me.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.613
Hold me for the first time.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.148
I think that I am troubled.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.050
I don't wanna go
inside the booth.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.030
Thank you.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.174
Forgive me, Father.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.243
For I have sinned.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.005
You are forgiven.

29:15.821 --> 29:16.987
Ah, a magician.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.056
My hobby.

29:19.058 --> 29:22.092
My profession,
Detective Lighthaze.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.529
Sorry for my
inconvenience, Doc.

29:26.499 --> 29:27.499
Can I come in?

29:28.534 --> 29:32.002
Uh, what may I
be of help with?

29:32.004 --> 29:34.872
Well, this visit
isn't actually official,

29:34.874 --> 29:37.541
I'm here on my accord.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.209
You see, something's
been stoking me, Doc.

29:40.212 --> 29:44.014
Like what?

29:44.016 --> 29:45.282
Can we sit down, Doc?

29:45.284 --> 29:48.485
Honestly, Detective,
I have another patient

29:48.487 --> 29:51.989
scheduled any moment so why
don't you come back at six?

29:58.230 --> 30:00.531
Okay then, see you at six.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.172
Oh, there's one
other thing, Doc.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.308
I'm crazy.

30:11.310 --> 30:17.381
So whatever I have to do to
get the truth, I'll do it.

32:36.255 --> 32:39.323
Oh, how childish of us
playing hide and seek.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.308
You scared me to death.

32:41.309 --> 32:43.292
Yes, it used to
be my favorite game.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.664
I'm supposed to meet
Detective Lighthaze in here.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.135
Oh, yes, well
you just missed him

32:53.072 --> 32:55.439
but he'll be back though.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.141
So, why don't you
come in and wait?

32:58.143 --> 33:00.177
No, thanks.

33:00.178 --> 33:02.212
You're a bit weird to my taste.

33:07.553 --> 33:10.687
Well, miss, this floor
is filled with loonies.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.069
Crazies.

33:14.070 --> 33:15.815
Just a little while
ago, a police officer

33:15.816 --> 33:17.561
removed a vile
character to cuffs, so.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.431
Who knows what's
behind that corner.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.069
Okay, well.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.441
I, I, I guess it's
better with a weirdo.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.210
Well, be my guest.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.189
I'm Sharon.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.794
I need to pee really badly.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.797
Can I use your bathroom?

33:59.538 --> 34:01.805
Fright affects the bladder.

34:40.379 --> 34:41.379
Hello?

34:43.514 --> 34:45.282
Hello, Doctor?

34:45.284 --> 34:46.850
I'm stuck in the bathroom.

34:46.851 --> 34:47.851
Open it up!

34:50.389 --> 34:51.588
The door is jammed.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.595
Doctor?

34:58.597 --> 35:02.666
I don't like dark,
locked bathrooms.

35:02.668 --> 35:03.668
Doctor?

35:41.206 --> 35:42.706
Hello?

35:42.708 --> 35:45.642
Hello?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.313
Doctor?

36:03.595 --> 36:04.728
You sure are jumpy.

36:06.331 --> 36:07.731
Regular or diet?

36:08.534 --> 36:10.267
Diet.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.369
You know regular is healthier?

36:12.371 --> 36:15.505
You see, the
chemicals in diet soda

36:15.507 --> 36:18.608
screws with your metabolism
and causes weight gain.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.543
Okay.

36:19.544 --> 36:20.544
I am a doctor you know.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.050
Cheers.

36:27.051 --> 36:28.350
Cheers.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.892
Please, come in.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.497
How do you know
the good detective?

36:42.568 --> 36:46.436
One night stand
became a two night stand

36:46.438 --> 36:50.640
and three night
stand and I haven't

36:50.642 --> 36:53.510
missed a single
night for six months.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.095
Hm.

36:55.096 --> 36:56.679
Well that sounds promising.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.516
Very.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.384
I wouldn't miss a single
night for anybody.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.456
And what about you?

37:08.260 --> 37:09.726
Why does he come to see you?

37:10.829 --> 37:14.965
Sorry, that's
doctor-patient privilege.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.468
All I gotta do
is ask, ya know?

37:19.304 --> 37:21.571
Well, why haven't you?

37:22.941 --> 37:24.007
I will.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.881
If he's hiding something...

37:37.556 --> 37:41.024
Sharon, the incline
position is for patients only.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.028
Not every night.

37:47.866 --> 37:52.736
Thursday night is card
night with the boys.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.341
How boring.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.048
Unless you're a card geek,

38:07.452 --> 38:12.589
52 cards, 13 ranks
each of the four suits,

38:13.625 --> 38:17.727
diamonds, clubs,
spades, and hearts.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.387
Ace of spades.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.004
Unique with its
large ornate spade.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.675
Said to be the death card.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.012
The king of hearts.

38:36.014 --> 38:39.783
The only king
without a mustache.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.386
Shown with a sword
behind his back

38:43.388 --> 38:46.423
making him appear as if
he's stabbing himself.

38:47.659 --> 38:52.429
But on closer examination,
you can see four hands.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.565
And the sleeve of the
hand holding the sword

38:55.567 --> 38:59.536
doesn't match the
sleeve of the king.

38:59.538 --> 39:04.641
So, in fact, the king
is being murdered.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.382
Sharon?

39:40.445 --> 39:42.612
Never switch drinks.

41:10.168 --> 41:12.836
Clever, you held your breath.

42:09.828 --> 42:10.828
In here.

42:43.194 --> 42:45.161
Now where did she go?

42:54.072 --> 42:56.139
Pure frantic adrenaline.

42:56.141 --> 42:57.807
Crawl into hiding.

42:57.809 --> 43:02.879
She must have fallen back
into unconsciousness.

43:02.881 --> 43:04.881
Huh, two crazies.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.623
I have an hour.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.243
Out of my way.

43:36.815 --> 43:38.848
Now, wait
for me, Hercules.

43:41.052 --> 43:42.685
Don't call me Hercules.

43:42.687 --> 43:43.987
Hercules was a myth.

43:43.989 --> 43:46.055
Samson was real.

43:50.395 --> 43:52.362
Samson.

43:52.363 --> 43:54.330
I'm curious, how
much do you bench?

43:54.332 --> 43:56.232
Look at my chest.

43:57.669 --> 43:59.335
Look at my chest!

43:59.337 --> 44:00.837
Bench press, bench press!

44:02.407 --> 44:04.674
Tons, baby, tons!

44:06.378 --> 44:07.877
How many reps is that?

44:08.680 --> 44:09.812
All day long!

44:13.284 --> 44:15.218
What about our biceps?

44:15.220 --> 44:16.386
Biceps?

44:16.388 --> 44:17.420
Biceps?

44:17.422 --> 44:22.025
Whatever I want!

44:27.766 --> 44:28.898
Well, I doubt it.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.450
What do you mean?

44:30.451 --> 44:32.001
No one can carry
that much weight.

44:32.003 --> 44:34.103
You callin' me a liar?

44:34.105 --> 44:35.438
Wishful wishing.

44:37.425 --> 44:39.409
You'll wish you
didn't say that!

44:42.013 --> 44:43.746
Prove it to me then, Maximo.

44:44.916 --> 44:48.184
This pen that I use
for my note taking,

44:49.854 --> 44:51.454
how much do you think it weighs?

44:51.456 --> 44:52.456
An ounce?

44:53.792 --> 44:54.791
Less?

44:54.793 --> 44:58.895
I bet you can't even lift it.

44:58.897 --> 45:00.730
Give me that pen!

45:04.803 --> 45:08.771
Ow, what the heck?

45:16.881 --> 45:19.315
Even small me is
stronger than you.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.454
Watch.

45:28.359 --> 45:33.362
I'll lift this heavy table
with just one finger.

45:57.122 --> 46:00.823
My God, you are, you
are stronger than me.

46:02.527 --> 46:04.460
I've never felt good enough.

46:05.797 --> 46:08.131
I've never been strong enough.

46:08.133 --> 46:10.099
Everybody's always
been stronger.

46:11.136 --> 46:13.469
I'm, I'm nothing.

46:13.471 --> 46:14.471
I'm weak.

46:15.974 --> 46:17.473
I don't mean shit, do I, Doc?

46:22.213 --> 46:25.548
Does that mean I
gotta go now, Doc?

46:25.550 --> 46:27.550
Don't you wanna be strong?

46:30.355 --> 46:31.355
Yes.

46:33.258 --> 46:36.425
Maximo, I wanna
admit something to you.

46:37.996 --> 46:39.362
I hypnotized you.

46:40.231 --> 46:42.165
What?

46:42.166 --> 46:44.100
But now I shall bring you
out of your hypnotic state

46:44.102 --> 46:47.270
by the sound of the
snap of my fingers.

47:07.258 --> 47:08.258
You see?

47:10.028 --> 47:12.995
In order to test
your real strength,

47:12.997 --> 47:16.899
you need to use your
mind or your body.

47:16.901 --> 47:19.402
Your subconscious
mind is much stronger

47:19.404 --> 47:22.471
than any physical
part of your body.

47:24.209 --> 47:26.475
Watch, I'll show you.

47:39.490 --> 47:40.890
Hello?

47:47.031 --> 47:48.031
Oops.

48:03.948 --> 48:07.316
Now, read this.

48:08.953 --> 48:10.319
It's your own handwriting.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.527
I have a reoccurring dream.

48:20.598 --> 48:23.132
I have the strength
to kill myself.

48:28.406 --> 48:33.542
12 steps to end the addiction,
one step to beat it all.

48:36.347 --> 48:39.415
You say you can lift well
over your own weight, right?

48:41.519 --> 48:42.519
Yeah.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.691
Why don't we try that out?

48:53.031 --> 48:58.167
Now, you see this
is a special knot.

49:00.104 --> 49:03.239
Which will not get any
tighter than I want it

49:03.241 --> 49:06.108
so you don't have to be
afraid of strangling yourself.

49:08.146 --> 49:11.547
Now, pull this free
end as hard as you can.

49:11.549 --> 49:14.984
No matter the pain,
and hoist your

49:14.986 --> 49:16.986
entire body up up up and away.

49:22.994 --> 49:23.526
Up you go.

49:23.527 --> 49:24.527
Nice.
- Height.

49:25.196 --> 49:26.529
Keep pulling.

49:27.265 --> 49:28.265
Excellent.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.433
Keep pulling.

49:32.003 --> 49:33.003
Heights.

49:33.604 --> 49:35.404
They make me nauseous.

49:35.405 --> 49:37.205
Overcome your fears, Maximo.

49:37.208 --> 49:38.407
Keep pulling.

49:44.415 --> 49:47.483
Just another inch, and
you're off the ground.

49:54.559 --> 49:57.293
Yes, yes you are Samson.

49:57.295 --> 49:59.595
Now pull yourself up, pull!

50:00.631 --> 50:01.631
Higher!

50:07.739 --> 50:09.038
There you go!

50:09.040 --> 50:10.639
Do you feel strong now?

50:10.641 --> 50:11.641
Woo-wee.

50:12.777 --> 50:14.443
And you're there!

50:23.388 --> 50:25.354
Keep going, Samson.

50:25.356 --> 50:29.191
Aye aye aye aye aye
aye, up up up and away!

50:30.595 --> 50:31.595
Woo-wee!

50:42.106 --> 50:43.739
That came right off.

51:49.707 --> 51:52.741
Would you pretend
to hang yourself?

52:36.320 --> 52:40.723
Sharon, I owe you your hour.

52:52.937 --> 52:53.937
Later.

53:51.462 --> 53:52.462
Sorry, later.

54:12.316 --> 54:13.482
Make any new friends?

54:13.484 --> 54:15.417
Yeah, the rats.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.586
When you said you'd start me
out with an entry level job

54:17.588 --> 54:19.688
I didn't know you
meant the basement.

54:19.690 --> 54:21.640
Yeah, well, when I started out

54:21.641 --> 54:23.721
I was cleaning up the dead
rats, so stop complaining.

54:25.630 --> 54:26.762
Got your pics.

54:31.636 --> 54:32.636
Nice trick.

54:33.604 --> 54:34.703
Gets trickier.

54:36.007 --> 54:37.606
Whoa, shit.

54:38.643 --> 54:39.643
How's that work?

54:41.045 --> 54:43.445
- If I told ya...
- You'd have to kill me?

54:44.315 --> 54:45.614
I'd have to kill them.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.654
So who are these guys you
had me trailing anyways?

54:51.656 --> 54:52.721
Police business.

54:54.859 --> 54:55.952
What the fuck, kid?

54:55.953 --> 54:57.046
- Hey.
- Are you some kind

54:57.047 --> 54:58.140
of goddamn voyeur or something?

54:58.141 --> 54:59.234
You said have fun.

54:59.235 --> 55:00.328
Yeah, I said have
fun with the targets,

55:00.331 --> 55:02.098
not me and my girl.

55:02.099 --> 55:03.866
Look, you shut me
out anyways, all right?

55:03.868 --> 55:05.334
Don't sweat it.

55:05.336 --> 55:06.336
Jesus.

55:07.905 --> 55:09.605
What's that thing?

55:09.607 --> 55:10.806
Still working on it.

55:10.808 --> 55:15.811
Look, I'm a snoop by
nature, but you get me out

55:15.813 --> 55:17.813
of this rat hole and into a car,

55:17.815 --> 55:19.548
I'll show you the
real stuff, all right?

55:19.550 --> 55:21.550
You're doing just fine
down here, kid, all right?

55:21.552 --> 55:23.669
There's rules and regulations.

55:23.670 --> 55:25.787
And rules and regulations
aren't gonna cut it anymore.

55:25.790 --> 55:28.357
I need a real job
with the department.

55:28.359 --> 55:30.092
Gotta be old enough,
smart enough, tough enough.

55:30.094 --> 55:31.827
Smart enough to know
you got something going on

55:31.829 --> 55:34.630
you don't want the
department knowing about.

55:34.632 --> 55:37.032
Smart enough but
not tough enough.

55:37.034 --> 55:38.767
Let me take a
bullet for you then.

55:38.769 --> 55:40.836
Prove it, I'm tougher
than you think.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.438
That's
what we all think.

55:44.642 --> 55:45.941
Do your own work then.

55:51.982 --> 55:54.083
You better watch
yourself, Gavin.

55:54.085 --> 55:56.418
Or I'll have you
parking the cars.

55:56.420 --> 55:59.922
If you, uh, ever get tired
of the dame you're with,

55:59.924 --> 56:02.858
and you're with a
nice getaway sticks,

56:02.860 --> 56:05.461
you'll make a great lover.

56:06.731 --> 56:08.164
What goes on
behind the curtain

56:08.165 --> 56:09.598
stays behind the
curtain with me.

56:11.001 --> 56:12.401
I'm dizzy for the dame.

56:12.403 --> 56:13.403
She's a keeper.

56:56.514 --> 56:58.147
Hold that, won't ya?

56:58.149 --> 56:59.848
Oh, thanks pal.

56:59.850 --> 57:01.317
Here, go like this.

57:01.318 --> 57:02.785
You look like you
could use a shower.

57:11.629 --> 57:13.595
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

57:13.597 --> 57:18.066
children of all ages, welcome
to the greatest show on Earth.

57:18.068 --> 57:20.602
It's circus time!

57:22.606 --> 57:24.940
See the ferocious lions.

57:24.942 --> 57:27.543
Thrill to the
gargantuous elephants!

57:27.545 --> 57:29.878
Laugh to death with
America's favorite clown.

57:31.215 --> 57:34.149
And here he is,
Thumba the clown!

57:45.762 --> 57:48.029
Well, what do you think
of my act so far, Doc?

57:48.032 --> 57:50.899
How do you fit in the car?

57:50.901 --> 57:51.901
Can't tell ya.

58:00.544 --> 58:03.178
Love the smell
of breeze makeup.

58:03.180 --> 58:04.847
It's my mother's lipstick.

58:08.185 --> 58:09.785
Imagine.

58:09.787 --> 58:11.253
Thumba the circus clown,

58:11.255 --> 58:13.922
self-proclaimed
ambassador of humor.

58:14.792 --> 58:16.191
What's left of me, any way?

58:17.194 --> 58:18.660
Too pooped to pop.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.799
Clowns are supposed
to live forever.

58:25.970 --> 58:27.603
Laughs never ending.

58:31.141 --> 58:36.011
Came to radiation, chemo.

58:40.017 --> 58:41.617
I'm done with the laughs.

58:44.555 --> 58:46.755
You were in the
three ring today?

58:46.757 --> 58:49.892
Yeah, kids laughed, all right.

58:52.696 --> 58:56.698
Done my routine,
opened up my mouth,

58:57.568 --> 58:58.700
pantomime laughs.

59:00.104 --> 59:01.303
I did them for years.

59:01.305 --> 59:05.874
Rain or shine, always count
on the clown for laughs.

59:07.111 --> 59:12.247
Only, on this cloudy day I
was crying on the inside.

59:17.021 --> 59:20.656
What will make you
laugh again, Thumba?

59:23.861 --> 59:26.862
If the docs told me
they made a mistake.

59:29.867 --> 59:32.200
And that they
misdiagnosed it and

59:33.771 --> 59:35.804
it's just the chemo
that's killing me.

59:40.044 --> 59:41.743
Laughing my whole life.

59:44.815 --> 59:48.617
Guess it's my time
now to cry, cry, cry.

59:51.822 --> 59:52.822
Party's over.

01:00:04.635 --> 01:00:05.635
Thanks.

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:09.204
I'm really sorry.

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:13.842
Poison's taken my dignity.

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:22.651
Oh, come on.

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.119
Not you, too.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.121
Here.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:33.395
I guess it's me
acting the bozo now.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:44.940
Humor makes more out of chaos

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:48.844
by dissolving
threatened anxiety.

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:54.850
Psychoneuroimmunology
has been a breakthrough

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:58.353
therapy for psychiatrists
in emotional healing.

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:07.029
And the poor bum's head,
all I want is a chance

01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:09.765
to show that money
can't buy you happiness.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:13.703
That's good.

01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:18.707
Frankel, survivor
of the Holocaust.

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:25.113
He says that, uh, humor is
another of the soul's weapons

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:29.151
in the fight for
self-preservation.

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:33.388
What's the matter?

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.724
Business so bad you
can't afford a clock?

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:45.902
Knock, knock.

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:48.003
Who's there?

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:49.404
Tank.

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:50.472
Tank who?

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:52.074
You're welcome.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.146
Oh, knock knock.

01:01:58.148 --> 01:01:59.081
Who is there?

01:01:59.083 --> 01:01:59.948
Wayne.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.117
Wayne who?

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.285
Wayne, Wayne, go away,
come again another day.

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:07.022
Knock, knock.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:08.023
Who's there?

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:08.957
Acid.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:10.192
Acid who?

01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:12.894
Acid sit down and be quiet!

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:15.797
Knock knock!

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:16.465
Who's there?

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:17.332
Disguise.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.101
Disguise who?

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:21.369
This guy's killing me
with all these jokes!

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:28.977
Knock knock!

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:29.979
Who's there?

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.314
Kill me.

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.216
Kill me who?

01:02:34.218 --> 01:02:36.985
If the cancer don't kill
me, this balloon will.

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:40.922
En garde!

01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:48.964
The doctor replied, don't
worry, I'll push you through.

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:54.102
In the liver.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.940
I could die laughing with you.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:03.512
Any way.

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.014
I feel a humor litany
snickering forth.

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:07.015
Oxymoron.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.283
Jumbo shrimp.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.802
Dry wit.

01:03:10.803 --> 01:03:12.486
Why are hemorrhoids
called hemorrhoids

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.956
instead of asteroids?

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.959
Sarcasm, if you're having a
hard time laughing at yourself,

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.427
I'd be happy to do it for ya.

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:24.166
Oh, how many people
have telekinetic powers?

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:25.867
Raise my hand.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:30.438
A laugh is the shortest
distance between two people.

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:34.276
I'm sorry, Thumba.

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:36.111
Laugh time's over.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.588
Wait.

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:51.159
Can't stop now.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:54.997
I'm on a roll.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:13.615
Vaudeville slapstick!

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:15.083
That's the best!

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:27.495
Hey, Joe, whattaya know?

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:36.104
That's what I call
a banana split!

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.110
Whoa, oh.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.080
Shouldn't of done that.

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:29.624
Oh man, come.

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:36.631
Can't a clown have no dignity?

01:05:47.311 --> 01:05:49.311
It's clogged all the time.

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:52.314
Couple of good plunges, all
your troubles down the drain.

01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:54.683
Thanks.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:56.318
Go for it.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:01.390
Freak.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:06.428
I hate bathroom humor.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:23.445
Pie in
the face slapstick.

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:28.416
That's what I call
eating humble pie.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:35.490
You're killing me.

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:03.518
Take the magic
seat, Detective.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.453
Tell me what's
been bothering you.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:07.188
Basically I'd like to
ask you some questions

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.257
off the record if
that's okay, Doc.

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:11.494
Sure.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.196
Chinese clock candle.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.534
You know clock history?

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:20.802
Grandfather sure did.

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:23.538
Owned a small clock
and watch repair.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:32.781
Had on display every known
time piece since time began.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.801
You charging for the hour, Doc?

01:07:36.802 --> 01:07:38.482
'Cause if so, I'll make
my questions quick.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.761
Oh no, on the house.

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:49.664
Least I can do for
a public servant.

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:54.369
Let's have a look.

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:59.707
Oh, you're on antidepressants
for clinical depression,

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:02.243
four years...
- That's now why I'm here, Doc

01:08:04.815 --> 01:08:06.581
The department shrink
prescribed those to me

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:07.583
after my wi...

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:16.457
After my wife was shot
and killed by a parolee.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:23.198
One who I arrested
for prior murder

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.666
who should've got the chair.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:38.412
I hunted him down to an
abandoned warehouse, Doc.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:45.220
Just me, him, and
my Glock, alone.

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:48.288
Wanted to put a
bullet in him bad.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:53.895
And I owe it to the
system that stopped me.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:57.198
After some bureaucratic
legal warfare with his lawyer

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.234
concocting every
lie in the bad book.

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:03.304
He walked away with a slap on
the wrist for breaking parole.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:07.774
And a misdemeanor for
peeing in the red zone.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.247
Rotten justice system,
Doc, I tell you.

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:16.385
Pissed away.

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:24.658
Anyways, the side effects
for the meds, they

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.327
they made me suicidal.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:28.930
I nearly jumped a bridge.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.669
So he got away with murder.

01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:42.410
That musta been hard
for you to live with.

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:43.877
Concession was that
me and the department

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.947
came to a quiet understanding.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.948
Promotion to detective.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:49.417
No, I earned that.

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:50.652
Oh, yes you did.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:58.359
How'd you wind up with
the folder anyways, Doc?

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:01.463
Part of the settlement
was that it would

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:03.231
never again see
the light of day.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:05.967
Was supposed to go into the
one-eyed purple paper eater.

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:09.771
One-eyed purple paper eater.

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:22.284
Burbed up evidence.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:24.052
Conscience nearly
shredded within.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.820
The one-eyed purple paper eater
regurgitated the settlement.

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:29.390
Now drop that
detective staying pass.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.593
The only way to
make the truth last.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.999
I'm beginning to
take offense, Doc.

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:40.001
Oh, Detective, please.

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:42.470
My last patient was a clown.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:45.540
I'm just in a funny mood.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:50.812
Would you like some tea?

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:57.318
Copy of the settlement.

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:05.460
It's classified.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:06.741
Bureaucratic incompetence again.

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.700
Typical misfiling.

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:15.703
Was supposed to go
to psychiatry 0083,

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:20.308
but winds up here,
psychiatry 8300.

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:25.780
Too bad it wasn't your
settlement check they sent, huh?

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:46.367
Things that
go bump in the night?

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.070
Mice.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.406
Rats.

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:52.640
Make a lot of thuds.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:58.613
What was it you wanted
to ask me, Detective?

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:09.491
Patient?

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.628
He used to be.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:14.829
What happened to him?

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:15.831
He moved on.

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.032
Moved on.

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:31.379
Are they under investigation?

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:32.780
Perhaps.

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:35.116
For what?

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.451
And are they all part of
the same crime syndicate?

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:41.723
I can take this.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:52.467
You expecting company, Doc?

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:52.994
Sharon, I do
owe you your hour.

01:13:54.731 --> 01:13:55.797
Haven't forgotten.

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.468
And Detective Lighthaze,
well you must think

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:02.915
me the big bad wolf.

01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:05.361
I do apologize for
the sudden concussion.

01:14:05.362 --> 01:14:07.807
See, you're not on the roster
so you shouldn't be involved.

01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:11.646
Except for that good old
detective's hunch interfering.

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:17.084
Yeah, I knew you knew a lot
more than you were telling me.

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:19.437
What?

01:14:19.438 --> 01:14:21.789
You probably knew they
were all dead in the closet

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:26.561
all by the virtue of my
expertise in facial coding.

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:30.031
The analyzing of facial movement

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:33.100
and atomically
based action units.

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:36.204
Clearly visible on the face.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:42.577
See, Charles Darwin said
even a person born blind

01:14:43.046 --> 01:14:45.513
has facial expressions.

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:49.684
just like you and I.

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:50.686
Hardwired.

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:53.055
Now.

01:14:58.795 --> 01:15:07.535
By birth, most core emotions
like fear, anger, sadness,

01:15:07.537 --> 01:15:14.675
truth, happiness, surprise,
is shown on the face.

01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:19.947
Now, means is curling
of an upper lip.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:23.150
Sign of disgust.

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:27.889
Or averted eyes, alerting
something hidden.

01:15:29.259 --> 01:15:32.894
Widening and raising
of nostril rings,

01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:42.603
I can even read the contraction
of the orbicularis oculi.

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:50.244
See, I trained for
two years studying

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:52.780
the muscles on my face.

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:56.584
Even going through the
pain, placing needles

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:58.753
into areas uncertain.

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:04.926
Then those muscles were
involuntarily fired

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:07.662
and electricity from
the needle placement

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:11.999
verified that it indeed
was the intended muscle.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:20.207
Now, as this method
was quite painful,

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:27.348
I learned to read
anyone at any time.

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:43.764
If I let you go, would
you promise not to tell?

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:05.052
Let me help you.

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:09.991
Are you familiar with
the Chinese handcuffs?

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:13.060
The tighter you pull,
the harder its grasp.

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:17.999
See, your initial reaction
is to pull outward,

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:21.802
but that only tightens the trap.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:25.673
You see, the solution to
escaping is to push inward

01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:27.808
towards the middle
thus enlarging

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.977
the opening and
freeing the hands.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:31.212
There you go.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:33.948
Oops, sorry.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:39.286
See, that is known
as the handcuff knot.

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:41.088
Identical to the
fireman's chair,

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.290
but not used for saving people,

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:47.428
but for handcuffing prisoners.

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:51.332
I could tell you about
the hangman's knot,

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.700
but I don't think that needs
an introduction, does it?

01:17:55.405 --> 01:18:00.374
So, now, Detective,
would you like to observe

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:02.910
the Sharon patient-doctor
relationship?

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:05.046
Or should I put you
under so as to save

01:18:05.048 --> 01:18:06.881
you from any bad memories?

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.449
Fuck you!

01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:10.918
I guess that means
you wanna watch.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:13.388
Are you sure?

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:19.560
Okie dokie.

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:21.795
But if you change your mind,
do not hesitate to tell me.

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:27.268
I do apologize for removing
your personals but,

01:18:29.072 --> 01:18:31.139
but you being tied up and all

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.207
it wouldn't be of
any use to you,

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.275
so why don't I just have
it right here beside me

01:18:35.278 --> 01:18:39.780

decides to show up again.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:50.491

01:29:38.674 --> 01:29:40.874
That one and only
bullet needed to kill

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:43.443
that scum before he
killed your wife.

01:29:43.445 --> 01:29:46.713
But on that misaligned day,
your chamber was empty!

01:29:49.418 --> 01:29:51.151
Such pity, such pity.

01:29:52.154 --> 01:29:54.154
Having emptied it
all at the range,

01:29:54.156 --> 01:29:56.957
pelting away at
that stupid target

01:29:56.959 --> 01:29:59.760
with its bad boys
going bang bang bang.

01:30:02.097 --> 01:30:03.463
Bullseye.

01:30:05.868 --> 01:30:09.836
Your suicide thoughts never
really went away entirely,

01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:10.871
did they, Gary?

01:30:10.873 --> 01:30:14.007
Just tucked away in
some nook and cranny

01:30:14.009 --> 01:30:17.477
of your subconscious
waiting for the right moment

01:30:17.479 --> 01:30:19.846
to come knocking at your door.

01:30:19.848 --> 01:30:23.583
You know this world is
crazy and you're stuck in it

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:25.886
knowing that you
will never be able

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:28.188
to bring your wife back and
that your substitute girlfriend

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:32.626
Sharon here, she just played
doctor with the doctor.

01:30:32.628 --> 01:30:34.661
No, don't listen to him, Gary.

01:30:34.663 --> 01:30:36.163
He's just playing
with your mind.

01:30:36.165 --> 01:30:38.732
You don't have to
listen to me or her.

01:30:39.668 --> 01:30:42.936
Just listen to that inner voice.

01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:46.873
You hear it?

01:30:48.744 --> 01:30:51.478
It's telling you to
turn the gun around.

01:30:52.214 --> 01:30:55.015
Yes.
- No, don't, stop.

01:30:55.017 --> 01:30:56.883
Don't, no that's crazy.

01:30:56.885 --> 01:30:59.019
But she's right, Gary.

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.154
An erratic heart blocks the
ability to think clearly.

01:31:02.758 --> 01:31:04.491
Stop, Gary.

01:31:04.492 --> 01:31:06.225
The heart is the seed
for love and emotion,

01:31:06.228 --> 01:31:10.697
it only takes one sixth of
a second to fall in love.

01:31:10.699 --> 01:31:13.767
Draining all of its
euphoria-induced chemicals

01:31:13.769 --> 01:31:16.036
like adrenaline,
dopamine, vasopressin.

01:31:16.038 --> 01:31:18.638
A love's high is
like a cocaine rush.

01:31:21.777 --> 01:31:23.810
But if you put a
bullet in your heart,

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:26.079
all of that love
bleeds forever away

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:29.816
and any possible hereafter never
to return for all eternity.

01:31:31.954 --> 01:31:33.987
- No.
- It's better to aim up north.

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:37.557
Towards the gray
matter, the brain.

01:31:38.727 --> 01:31:39.926
There you go.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:42.095
Parietal lobe.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:47.968
Turns spatial sense, navigation.

01:31:51.139 --> 01:31:54.808
The occipital lobe is the
visual processing center.

01:31:59.548 --> 01:32:02.949
The frontal lobe only
control voluntary movements.

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:08.288
X marks the spot.

01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:12.893
The temporal lobe, home
for long term memory.

01:32:12.895 --> 01:32:17.264
Put a bullet in there and all
that is crazy cease to exist.

01:32:31.847 --> 01:32:33.780
Huh.

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.714
That lousy bullet
means, time's up Doc.

01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:47.060
Touché, Detective!

01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:51.197
Crazy mind play, you
almost had me checkmate.

01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:53.500
Well if I'm gonna kill myself,

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.802
it's not gonna be for the
likes of you, Doctor Jekyll.

01:32:55.804 --> 01:32:58.422
Oh.

01:32:58.423 --> 01:33:01.041
Eccentric creator types
are never fully understood.

01:33:07.265 --> 01:33:10.350
Then each man lurks the
impulses for good and evil.

01:33:10.352 --> 01:33:11.952
So sorry, Gary.

01:33:13.322 --> 01:33:15.088
Forgiven.

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:17.624
Just don't give me any
sorrys later, will ya?

01:33:18.827 --> 01:33:20.193
When I ask you to marry me.

01:33:20.195 --> 01:33:23.196
Oh, how sweet and cuddly.

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:29.202
How I miss those
befuddled delusional days.

01:33:30.906 --> 01:33:33.206
You think it's impossible
to be in love, Doc?

01:33:34.843 --> 01:33:38.945
Not at all, just
impossible for us humans.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:41.815
Apes, fish, bacteria, maybe.

01:33:42.684 --> 01:33:44.317
But us?

01:33:44.319 --> 01:33:48.054
With our infinite
gaping free will.

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:53.660
The rapture of love is
eventually contaminated

01:33:53.662 --> 01:33:55.695
by our lust for more.

01:33:56.865 --> 01:33:58.665
And what makes you the expert?

01:33:59.868 --> 01:34:00.868
Tap once.

01:34:10.946 --> 01:34:15.281
♪ Heart break oh
sweet heart break ♪

01:34:35.237 --> 01:34:37.904
You're lucky I had that
empty coffee cup back there.

01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:39.773
When nature calls.

01:34:39.775 --> 01:34:41.875
Keep your eyes on
the road, perv.

01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:48.114
Whoa, okay, okay.

01:34:48.116 --> 01:34:49.449
Drive.

01:34:50.786 --> 01:34:52.185
Okay, okay, okay.

01:34:54.322 --> 01:34:55.455
AC/DC.

01:34:55.457 --> 01:34:56.923
I didn't even like that band.

01:34:56.925 --> 01:34:58.341
I don't know.

01:34:58.342 --> 01:34:59.758
AC/DC means
codeine cough syrup.

01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:05.465
Are you dry?

01:35:05.467 --> 01:35:07.067
Have you got any antifreeze?

01:35:07.069 --> 01:35:08.468
What are you talking about?

01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:10.737
- I'm an all star.
- Okay, you're the star.

01:35:10.739 --> 01:35:12.806
- I'm an all star.
- You are the star.

01:35:12.808 --> 01:35:14.274
An all star, it means
he does all drugs.

01:35:14.276 --> 01:35:15.942
He's freaking out, don't
do anything stupid.

01:35:15.944 --> 01:35:17.310
I'm not gonna do
anything stupid.

01:35:17.312 --> 01:35:19.045
Just be cool, all right?

01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:20.480
Everybody just relax, okay?

01:35:21.883 --> 01:35:22.883
Hey, look out.

01:35:30.192 --> 01:35:31.458
You got lucky.

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:36.163
Oh.

01:35:39.167 --> 01:35:43.236
You only got one bullet,
Doc, but two of us.

01:35:43.238 --> 01:35:45.839
I have contemplated
the options.

01:35:45.841 --> 01:35:50.977
If I put a bullet in Sharon,
you survive to overcome me.

01:35:52.047 --> 01:35:54.180
But if I put a bullet
in you, she survives,

01:35:54.182 --> 01:35:56.382
whom I can easily overcome.

01:36:03.992 --> 01:36:06.059
There is a third option.

01:36:06.061 --> 01:36:08.261
I line the two of you up
side by side and put a bullet

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:10.330
in both of your heads
at the same time,

01:36:10.332 --> 01:36:12.866
putting both of you
out of your misery.

01:36:12.868 --> 01:36:15.268
Two love birds with
one stone, per se.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:18.638
For what greater reason?

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:21.006
Oh, you will understand
when the time comes.

01:36:34.890 --> 01:36:37.157
Boom, you were easy.

01:36:37.159 --> 01:36:41.861
Oh, we went all the way.
- Yeah, we did.

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:45.365
Who the hell are you guys?

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:48.301
Oh, Lighthaze's sidekick
and my girlfriend, Kara.

01:36:48.303 --> 01:36:50.970
Don't count those
chickens quite yet.

01:36:52.174 --> 01:36:54.841
Grand show, kid, but how
the hell you'd find me?

01:36:54.843 --> 01:36:58.378
Oh, GPS I put in
your pocket earlier.

01:36:59.514 --> 01:37:01.181
Sorry.

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:02.849
But then, the
signals got scrambled

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.517
by Hank William's Jambalaya
and we found ourselves

01:37:04.519 --> 01:37:06.452
in some super
shady neighborhood,

01:37:06.454 --> 01:37:10.123
until I figured
cut the car radio.

01:37:10.125 --> 01:37:13.526
And then there was that super
crazy drug addict car jacking,

01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:16.596
but I busted him in the head
with a beer that dreamer boy

01:37:16.598 --> 01:37:18.598
here was trying to
get me drunk with.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.333
- Hey, that dreamer.
- You're here, but you'll

01:37:20.335 --> 01:37:22.302
never leave, not alive anyway.

01:37:22.304 --> 01:37:23.787
What the hell?

01:37:23.788 --> 01:37:25.468
Got you on both side
effects of the drug.

01:37:26.141 --> 01:37:30.276
See, slow reflexes and impaired

01:37:30.278 --> 01:37:33.179
precognitive awareness
on your part.

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:36.449
On my part, I've been
studying the mechanism

01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:39.052
of the aquatic meat
eating bladderwort.

01:37:39.054 --> 01:37:43.623
The fastest trapping
carnivorous plant on the planet.

01:37:45.327 --> 01:37:48.561
They suck their prey
less than a millisecond.

01:37:48.563 --> 01:37:51.297
You moron, I knew this
was gonna be a sucky date.

01:37:51.299 --> 01:37:54.184
Suck, suck, suck.

01:37:54.185 --> 01:37:57.070
Here we are with another sick
dude pointing a gun at us.

01:37:57.072 --> 01:37:58.772
Like, what else
were you gonna do?

01:37:58.773 --> 01:38:00.473
Sit at home and
watch Model Runway

01:38:00.475 --> 01:38:02.909
like you're ever
gonna be a model?

01:38:02.911 --> 01:38:06.112
What are you trying to say
you lanky four-eyed freak?

01:38:06.114 --> 01:38:07.731
That I'm not beautiful?

01:38:07.732 --> 01:38:09.349
Well, I mean
perhaps if the eyes

01:38:09.351 --> 01:38:11.918
of a blind beholder.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.654
Issues, I love it.

01:38:14.656 --> 01:38:16.656
New patients, why don't you two

01:38:16.658 --> 01:38:19.659
go sit on the couch over there?

01:38:20.595 --> 01:38:21.595
Yeah.

01:38:24.099 --> 01:38:25.099
Come, come.

01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:30.603
I promise I won't bite.

01:38:30.605 --> 01:38:32.005
There you go.

01:38:33.608 --> 01:38:36.009
And you two, why
don't you go watch?

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:38.544
Do I have to repeat myself?

01:38:45.287 --> 01:38:47.086
Move over, have Sharon there.

01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:49.956
Yes, and Lighthaze,
please sit down.

01:38:57.032 --> 01:38:59.132
What the freak is that?

01:38:59.134 --> 01:39:00.967
He's lighting that creepy thing.

01:39:01.636 --> 01:39:04.604
It's a candle.

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:07.573
It's got weird little
baby things hanging from it.

01:39:07.575 --> 01:39:10.710
I don't have time
for the entire hour,

01:39:10.712 --> 01:39:15.381
so I'm gonna cut your session
down to the last 10 minutes.

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:18.985
Okay, I am starting
to freak out.

01:39:18.987 --> 01:39:21.254
I'm gonna have to see a
psychiatrist after this.

01:39:22.657 --> 01:39:25.124
What do you think he is?

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:31.464
Not hypocrites,
but a hypocrite.

01:39:33.335 --> 01:39:35.401
And you're beautiful.

01:39:36.404 --> 01:39:39.272
Now please, let me
ask the questions.

01:39:39.274 --> 01:39:40.273
No.

01:39:40.275 --> 01:39:43.209
I don't want you
asking me anything.

01:39:43.211 --> 01:39:45.578
Anger, interesting.

01:39:46.748 --> 01:39:49.682
Let's investigate the
origin of that anger.

01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:55.153
Okay, buckle up buddy.

01:39:55.156 --> 01:39:58.091
Age two, I was put for adoption
by my drug addict mother

01:39:58.093 --> 01:40:00.426
after my alcoholic
father left town.

01:40:00.428 --> 01:40:03.363
My foster family molested the
crap outta me till I was old

01:40:03.365 --> 01:40:05.231
enough to run away with
my abusive boyfriend.

01:40:05.233 --> 01:40:07.166
I ran away from him and
now I'm here with some

01:40:07.168 --> 01:40:09.302
psychotic freak pointing
a gun at my face.

01:40:09.304 --> 01:40:13.106
So, yeah, I am fuming
with resentment,

01:40:13.108 --> 01:40:15.375
betrayal, abandonment,
you name it.

01:40:15.377 --> 01:40:16.377
Okay?

01:40:17.612 --> 01:40:19.178
Session's over.

01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:23.116
Very good, beautiful.

01:40:23.118 --> 01:40:24.117
Very good.

01:40:24.119 --> 01:40:27.120
Don't call me beautiful.

01:40:27.122 --> 01:40:29.455
It usually takes
months for someone

01:40:29.457 --> 01:40:32.592
to reach this awakened state.

01:40:33.595 --> 01:40:36.462
And what about you
young detective?

01:40:36.464 --> 01:40:39.399
Me?

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.335
Yes, what's ticking
inside that sly, smart,

01:40:42.337 --> 01:40:45.071
but yet so confused
brain of yours?

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:47.541
Nothin'.

01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:49.410
Nope.

01:40:50.645 --> 01:40:52.078
Your life is perfect?

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:56.349
Um, yeah, splendid.

01:40:57.552 --> 01:40:59.485
Life of Riley really.

01:40:59.487 --> 01:41:01.287
Well that sounds sarcastic.

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:05.558
Nothing a little
death couldn't fix.

01:41:07.595 --> 01:41:09.629
Remember that little
problem you had with

01:41:10.765 --> 01:41:12.565
one bullet and two targets, Doc?

01:41:14.702 --> 01:41:16.169
Now there's four of us.

01:41:17.639 --> 01:41:21.240
See our bullet is for
Detective Lighthaze.

01:41:23.645 --> 01:41:26.212
Oh, my God.

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:28.780
Hidden dagger is for the
rest of you, now move over.

01:41:28.783 --> 01:41:30.583
I do apologize,
but because of time

01:41:30.585 --> 01:41:32.518
there will be no
last wishes granted.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.320
Why don't you
take it easy, Doc.

01:41:34.322 --> 01:41:35.421
Proposition.

01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:38.441
Proposition?

01:41:38.442 --> 01:41:41.460
Until I shoot you, you'll
all obey my instructions.

01:41:43.131 --> 01:41:47.266
I'll just have you
tie the others up,

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:49.135
thus ensuring no escape.

01:41:54.342 --> 01:41:55.575
Thanks, kid.

01:42:01.182 --> 01:42:03.316
Just a little slap
for skin croaker.

01:42:03.318 --> 01:42:05.351
A little taste of blood
before your neck cracks

01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:07.720
taking big dance.

01:42:11.192 --> 01:42:12.492
You're so beautiful.

01:42:17.298 --> 01:42:19.332
That one's for
calling me beautiful.

01:42:22.704 --> 01:42:24.303
Gavin, pick up that rope.

01:42:28.176 --> 01:42:31.844
Tie this rat bastard's hands
behind his back real good.

01:42:37.585 --> 01:42:39.252
In the mood for some good ole'

01:42:39.254 --> 01:42:41.320
fashion capital punishment, Doc?

01:42:42.457 --> 01:42:43.890
'Cause it's comin' your way.

01:42:45.193 --> 01:42:48.394
Actually, I don't think so.

01:42:48.396 --> 01:42:49.862
Oh, is that right?

01:42:49.864 --> 01:42:51.797
Gavin, you got a phone?

01:42:51.799 --> 01:42:53.766
Yeah, here.

01:42:57.939 --> 01:43:00.673
Colts, it's Lighthaze.

01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:02.175
I need you to send in the cavs,

01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:03.676
we got ourselves a horse seed.

01:43:03.678 --> 01:43:04.944
You got signal on my 20?

01:43:06.347 --> 01:43:07.480
Good.

01:43:07.482 --> 01:43:08.881
The wonders of GPS, right?

01:43:13.922 --> 01:43:16.255
Why you say that, Doc?

01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:17.823
A little birdy told me so.

01:43:30.972 --> 01:43:32.905
Sharon, grab those.

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.839
Court on record, my
name is Eileen Schafer

01:43:34.842 --> 01:43:37.910
and I will be acting as
independent council and witness

01:43:37.912 --> 01:43:41.948
for the current transaction,
as both parties have so agreed.

01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:43.983
Good doctor, if you've
signed, can you please hand

01:43:43.985 --> 01:43:47.820
the form to Nun Agatha so
she can sign for the camera?

01:43:50.425 --> 01:43:52.458
My depression is
no longer bearable.

01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:10.576
Cancer's
worth than death.

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:21.320
We must finish this
interview and have you sign

01:44:21.322 --> 01:44:24.957
the voluntary euthanasia
consent and release waiver.

01:44:25.827 --> 01:44:27.293
Suicide?

01:44:29.364 --> 01:44:30.496
Yes, correct.

01:44:35.703 --> 01:44:38.838
You sign the
voluntary euthanasia.

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:39.840
Euthanasia.

01:44:41.576 --> 01:44:42.576
Euthanasia.

01:44:43.911 --> 01:44:44.911
Euthanasia.

01:44:50.785 --> 01:44:52.518
The grim reaper.

01:44:59.594 --> 01:45:00.860
The grim reaper.

01:45:03.531 --> 01:45:05.998
Who is dancing now?

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:08.466
Oh, that's so
type cast medieval.

01:45:08.469 --> 01:45:12.672
I don't carry a scythe, nor
am I clothed in a black cloak

01:45:12.674 --> 01:45:16.475
and a hood, how about
the angel of death.

01:45:21.015 --> 01:45:23.649
If I did it without
permission from my patients,

01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:25.551
I would be a murderer.

01:45:25.553 --> 01:45:27.353
Jesus Christ, Doc.

01:45:27.355 --> 01:45:29.021
A crucifix shoved
through one's throat.

01:45:29.023 --> 01:45:30.690
Another suffocation by balloon.

01:45:30.692 --> 01:45:32.024
One's head ripped off.

01:45:32.026 --> 01:45:33.492
One stabbed to death.

01:45:34.028 --> 01:45:35.828
That ain't gonna fly.

01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:38.531
All patients have
the right to choose.

01:45:38.533 --> 01:45:41.367
I just added a little
flare, that's all.

01:45:42.437 --> 01:45:43.636
Huh, they're right.

01:45:44.806 --> 01:45:46.038
Well, we'll just let a tired,

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.807
hungry, angry jury decide that.

01:45:47.809 --> 01:45:49.575
How's that sound, pal?

01:45:49.577 --> 01:45:54.714
I hope you don't mind
if I snooze for a while,

01:45:55.717 --> 01:45:59.985
while you discuss
your scare tactics.

01:46:00.788 --> 01:46:03.623
You know as well as I do,

01:46:03.624 --> 01:46:06.459
that my right to die
defense team will shame

01:46:06.461 --> 01:46:10.129
any prosecution into
complete annihilation.

01:46:11.132 --> 01:46:14.066
You've seen the clear
and convincing evidence.

01:46:14.068 --> 01:46:17.002
Not only did they all
ask for my services,

01:46:17.004 --> 01:46:19.805
they consented to it in writing,

01:46:19.807 --> 01:46:23.409
which I believe you are
holding onto right now

01:46:23.411 --> 01:46:26.679
and on camera with witnesses.

01:46:27.949 --> 01:46:30.950
Any jury would think of
me as a saint for all

01:46:30.952 --> 01:46:33.486
the help I've been
giving my patients.

01:46:34.455 --> 01:46:38.157
I'll be acquitted and
all you'll wind up

01:46:38.159 --> 01:46:41.093
with is just bad memories.

01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:45.598
I'll have 'em anyway.

01:46:46.167 --> 01:46:48.134
Hold me against my will.

01:46:48.136 --> 01:46:51.437
I'm sure they'll put me
away for life on that one.

01:46:51.439 --> 01:46:54.039
Okay, what about
forced entry, huh?

01:46:54.041 --> 01:46:56.809
Assault and battery,
how's that sound.

01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:59.578
Well, I am a doctor, any
the exam I did was consented

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:01.180
to by my patients.

01:47:12.527 --> 01:47:14.527
What are you gonna do?

01:47:23.905 --> 01:47:25.671
Oh, that felt good.

01:47:28.743 --> 01:47:32.745
Well, I guess
everything's in order now.

01:47:33.748 --> 01:47:36.916
So I'll be going, unless
you wanna ticket me

01:47:36.918 --> 01:47:40.019
for parking in the red zone,
detective, across the street.

01:47:46.227 --> 01:47:47.560
Untie the rat.

01:47:47.562 --> 01:47:48.562
What?

01:47:49.163 --> 01:47:50.229
After all of his...

01:47:50.231 --> 01:47:51.797
Just fuckin' untie him.

01:47:55.536 --> 01:47:58.054
Are you for real?

01:47:58.055 --> 01:48:00.573
I hope you get caught
by a real good sting

01:48:00.575 --> 01:48:01.907
and I'm not talkin' about.

01:48:14.188 --> 01:48:17.590
Well, excuse me darling.

01:48:24.799 --> 01:48:28.834
Making all of your acquaintances
has been pleasurable.

01:48:33.741 --> 01:48:35.941
Until next time,.

01:48:58.633 --> 01:49:00.299
Hey guys, part
of the team, Gavin.

01:49:00.301 --> 01:49:02.068
- Hey, Chief.
- What's goin' on, Colts?

01:49:02.069 --> 01:49:03.836
Man, they must be cookin'
something good for you

01:49:03.838 --> 01:49:05.771
to get out here and do
your own legwork, huh?

01:49:05.773 --> 01:49:07.640
Yeah, you want something
done, do it yourself, right?

01:49:07.642 --> 01:49:08.841
I hear that.

01:49:08.843 --> 01:49:12.578
Oh, I am up for
insomnia tonight.

01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:14.747
So why
are you lookin'?

01:49:14.749 --> 01:49:16.615
Oh, morbid curiosity.

01:49:19.921 --> 01:49:21.287
And the closet too, boys.

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:22.654
Stiff model in the
clothes in there.

01:49:22.657 --> 01:49:24.123
Matty, do me a favor.

01:49:24.124 --> 01:49:25.590
See how many skeletons
they got in there.

01:49:25.593 --> 01:49:26.926
Hey, uh, detective.

01:49:26.928 --> 01:49:31.330
means don't judge

01:49:31.332 --> 01:49:32.731
a book by it's cover.

01:49:37.638 --> 01:49:39.271
The burlesque queen
wasn't in that DVD.

01:49:39.273 --> 01:49:40.273
No.

01:49:41.609 --> 01:49:43.208
And she wasn't
in those either.

01:49:44.946 --> 01:49:47.012
And neither is
the stiff outside.

01:49:47.014 --> 01:49:48.347
Right.

01:49:51.185 --> 01:49:54.053
Hey Mancioni, lift
up his left hand.

01:49:54.055 --> 01:49:55.654
Yes, Chief.

01:50:10.972 --> 01:50:12.972
Chief, look what
we found on him.

01:50:21.315 --> 01:50:22.982
The sheer magnitude
of my patients

01:50:22.984 --> 01:50:25.985
suffering depression has
finally gotten to me.

01:50:25.987 --> 01:50:29.088
I can no longer live a normal
life without anger, guilt,

01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:32.658
so therefore I have
decided to end my own life,

01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:35.861
as I've done so neatly and
simply for my patients.

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.833
Why don't you bag that
up for me, all right?

01:50:40.835 --> 01:50:43.068
Okay, sure, bag that up.

01:50:44.338 --> 01:50:46.705
- Colts.
- Yeah, what's up, Chief?

01:50:46.707 --> 01:50:48.140
I've been hoodwinked

01:50:48.142 --> 01:50:49.909
Hoodwinked, what
are you talkin' about?

01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:51.677
The man I let go
wasn't our mercy doctor.

01:50:51.679 --> 01:50:53.379
No?

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:55.080
No, no, our good
doctor's outside, dead.

01:50:57.685 --> 01:51:00.252
Dead?

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:02.820
He got sick and tired of
killin' off his sick patients

01:51:02.823 --> 01:51:04.356
and decides to
join in on the fun.

01:51:04.358 --> 01:51:05.691
All right.

01:51:06.961 --> 01:51:09.528
So he hangs himself.

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:12.096
Problem is though, the rope
didn't do it quick enough.

01:51:12.099 --> 01:51:17.036
Half conscious and dizzy,
he releases himself

01:51:17.038 --> 01:51:21.373
and in desperate search for
breath, he collapses outside.

01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:29.882
Our clever Dr. Jekyll
was no ordinary killer.

01:51:29.884 --> 01:51:32.284
He's a devilish mastermind
to be reckoned with.

01:51:34.388 --> 01:51:36.989
What better way
for serial murder

01:51:36.991 --> 01:51:38.757
than a psychiatrist's
office with an easy

01:51:38.759 --> 01:51:40.993
by appointment line
up for mercy killings?

01:51:44.865 --> 01:51:46.999
I mean, he didn't even
have to go to his prey.

01:51:47.001 --> 01:51:50.402
They came right into his
trap begging him to kill 'em.

01:51:52.473 --> 01:51:53.473
My God.

01:51:54.775 --> 01:51:56.275
Wait.

01:51:56.277 --> 01:51:58.310
That leaves the
burlesque queen, right?

01:51:58.312 --> 01:52:01.346
Hey fellas, look
what I found sticking

01:52:01.348 --> 01:52:03.348
out of her underwear.

01:52:04.752 --> 01:52:08.287
Jeez, how deep did you have
to dig for one there, Leroy?

01:52:08.289 --> 01:52:09.755
Really, you're disgusting.

01:52:09.757 --> 01:52:11.323
In glove, come on.

01:52:11.324 --> 01:52:12.890
Why don't you take the
chatter outside, boys.

01:52:12.893 --> 01:52:13.893
Go ahead.

01:52:14.495 --> 01:52:16.962
What have you got there?

01:52:16.964 --> 01:52:18.197
- Revenge.
- Revenge?

01:52:18.199 --> 01:52:22.034
He says he was put to
rest through euthanasia.

01:52:22.036 --> 01:52:23.469
She came in to do
the good doctor in,

01:52:23.471 --> 01:52:26.438
but met up with the wrong guy.

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:27.806
Yeah, I'll say.

01:52:29.210 --> 01:52:30.375
- I gotta get some air.
- All right.

01:52:30.377 --> 01:52:32.094
Yeah, I got this.

01:52:32.095 --> 01:52:33.812
Gavin, get off
the table, come on.

01:52:33.814 --> 01:52:35.481
Hey uh, Chief, uh.

01:52:36.784 --> 01:52:39.001
I was wondering um,

01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:41.219
can I stick around and
learn a few things?

01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:44.823
All right, everyone listen up.

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:49.328
Gavin here just got promoted,
so let him take notes.

01:52:49.330 --> 01:52:51.864
Looks good.
- Thanks, Chief.

01:52:52.833 --> 01:52:54.466
Uh, where's the bathroom?

01:52:54.468 --> 01:52:56.335
Down the hall to the left.

01:52:58.472 --> 01:53:03.542
Hey, um, maybe later
we might go all the way?

01:53:04.278 --> 01:53:06.378
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

01:53:29.904 --> 01:53:32.037
You played it
too close to call.

01:53:32.039 --> 01:53:33.872
Look who's talking.

01:53:33.874 --> 01:53:36.108
So, why'd you let him go?

01:53:40.247 --> 01:53:42.447
Wait, you knew all along.

01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:18.550
