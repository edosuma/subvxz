Oh. Sorry, but--

13:54.868 --> 13:56.636
Uh, we might have
some glue.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.539
No, i-it's, uh-- it's--
it's okay.
[ Ben ] Oh, no.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.943
I think I have another pair
for that outfit.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.079
It's a good color.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.082
Excuse me.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.521
Hey, uh, you need
a hand with that?

14:14.587 --> 14:17.958
Now, uh, don't dillydally
there, pretty lady.

14:18.025 --> 14:21.294
We're all gonna be down here
talkin' about you.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.936
Do you remember Miss Lewin?
Remember her?
Yeah.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.904
Second grade?
Yeah!

14:30.971 --> 14:33.873
[ Sybil ] Are we
talking about the one
without the lips?

14:33.941 --> 14:37.244
- Exactly.
Man, I was so into her!
- [ Amy ] You are a freak.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.112
Yeah. Yeah.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.281
She's sweet. Right?
Incredible.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.984
Thank you, sir.
[ Ben ]
Yeah.

14:44.051 --> 14:48.121
- Doesn't she seem incredible?
- Yeah. It appears
that she is incredible.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.524
So, uh, Everett,
where'd you find her?

14:51.591 --> 14:53.760
Hong Kong.
Last spring.

14:53.826 --> 14:57.364
Well, actually,
over on Kowloon side.
Not Hong Kong Island.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.700
Although we were
both staying there--
on Hong Kong Island, that is.

15:00.767 --> 15:04.004
Everett at the Grand Hyatt.
I was at the Mandarin.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.240
But we were introduced
in the lobby of the Peninsula.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.542
[ Shouting ]
That's-- That's on
Kowloon side!

15:11.644 --> 15:15.115
Anyway, I was there for
this post-post-unification
conference,

15:15.182 --> 15:18.185
and I had a meeting
over at the Peninsula,

15:18.251 --> 15:21.621
and there I am,
crossing the lobby,
and who do I see...

15:21.688 --> 15:23.523
but Rachel Graham.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.193
[ Sighs ]
Who?
What were you wearing?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.696
It'd been what--
Ten years? More?
God, almost 16.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.966
Andover. So there I am,
catching up with Rachel,
and here comes Everett.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.169
Of course, I don't know him,
but Rachel does-- they got
their masters' together.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.739
And you hadn't seen each other
in, what was it-- eight years?

15:39.806 --> 15:43.410
Anyway, the point is Everett
was lost. Do you remember?
What?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.645
How you were lost?
I'm pretty sure
I was pretending.

15:45.712 --> 15:49.616
He was on his way
to take some boat out to--
What was that place again?

15:49.682 --> 15:52.119
Lantao.
Lantao Island.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.288
Right. Some pilgrimage
he'd gotten into his head.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.558
On his way to see
some Buddhist statue
at some monastery.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.594
In fact, it's one of
the largest metal
Buddhas in the world.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.031
- Metal Buddha.
- [ Everett ]
It's over three stories tall.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.865
Fascinating.

16:05.932 --> 16:09.669
You can stay at this
monastery, actually...
share meals with the monks.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.272
- But they've taken
a vow of silence.
- A vow of what?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.375
Your tie's crooked.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.479
Sounds incredible.
How long where you there?

16:19.546 --> 16:22.649
He never made it, of course.
One thing led to another.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.884
Rachel suggested lunch.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.886
We got to talking.

16:26.953 --> 16:30.490
- Everett,
what did you two talk about?
- I don't-- I don't remember.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.260
This is just--
It's just a little tight.
What are you--

16:33.326 --> 16:35.662
Will you take
that goddamn tie off already?

16:35.728 --> 16:38.731
[ Meredith ]
Oh, please!
Of course you remember!

16:38.798 --> 16:42.369
Everett was there on business
with Steve, working out
their position for the I.P.O.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.471
Well, of course,
that's what I do.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.339
Really?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.475
Within
the Asian market.

16:48.541 --> 16:53.113
Anyway, s--
so, lunch led to drinks,
which led to dinner.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.748
Rachel took off,
and-- and, um, really,

16:55.815 --> 16:58.985
that's how Everett and I spent
our first night together--

16:59.052 --> 17:02.322
- [ Everett ] Yeah.
- me just putting in my two
cents, going over that report.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.291
I just showed Everett
a few things
that needed to be done.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.999
Meredith
was a real help.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.102
We were just lucky.

17:15.167 --> 17:17.804
Both in the right place
at the right time.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.872
Destiny.
[ Whispers ]
Destiny.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.108
- Right, honey?
- Right.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.281
[ Together ]
Well--

17:28.348 --> 17:31.118
- Okay, so--
- Oh. Here.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.553
- Let me help you with that.
- No, no, no. No.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.123
Don't trouble yourself.
You're the guest.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.125
[ Sybil ]
All right,
where is it?

17:38.191 --> 17:40.660
Well, then maybe
I'll just wash my hands.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.101
All right, Ben.
Come on.
Still workin' on it, honey.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.038
I told you--

17:52.105 --> 17:55.142
It's in there.
Mom.
What?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.510
Mom, listen.
I wanna talk to you.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.147
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.982
There's something
I wanna ask you.
Yeah?

18:03.049 --> 18:06.386
I thought that might be it.
But now's not the time. I--

18:08.121 --> 18:10.257
Well--

18:13.092 --> 18:15.328
[ Everett ]
Safe.
[ Amy ] No. Done.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.330
Open.
Opening it up.
[ Amy ]
Chest.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.399
Chest hair.
No?

18:19.466 --> 18:22.335
- Oh!
"Billy, Don't Be a Hero"!
- What?

18:22.402 --> 18:24.003
Ah!
Thank you!
That's it?

18:24.070 --> 18:26.706
- That's a song?
- Yes, it's a song.
You've heard it.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.277
- No.
- Whose clue was that?
It's not very-- It's not good.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.945
[ Clears Throat ]

18:33.012 --> 18:36.048
I wanna go again.
[ Susannah ] No, you need
to wind it down.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.085
[ Amy ]
No, no, Elizabeth.
Meredith hasn't had a turn yet.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.655
- No, that's all right. I--
- No, no, no.
I'll find one for you.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.625
No, really, I don't--
No, come on.
Come on, Mer.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.461
[ Ben ]
Come on, la mer!
There. That one's perfect.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.168
It's a movie.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.705
Okay, movie.
[ Amy ]
No talking.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.407

19:02.342 --> 19:04.477

Second word.
Second word.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.096
Um--
[ Susannah ]
Wedding!

19:24.163 --> 19:26.132
- Marriage.
- Ring!

19:26.199 --> 19:28.835
Bride.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.271
- Princess Bride!
- [ Susannah ]
Four words.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.140
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.643
- Oh, no. That's six.
- You know what the answer is.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.645
- I'm just trying to help.
- [ Clears Throat ]

19:38.711 --> 19:40.680
- [ Together ]
Third word.
- [ Whispers ] All right.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.682
Um--

19:42.749 --> 19:45.685
- Nylons?
- Pants?

19:45.752 --> 19:48.488
- [ Everett ]
Personal style. Apparel.
- [ Susannah ] Suit.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.790
Fourth word.
[ Sighs ]

19:50.857 --> 19:52.859
It's okay. It's okay.
Fourth word.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.230
I can't believe
you're pointing at him.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.532
[ Ben ] What?
[ Everett ]
Who?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.737
[ Meredith ]
No! I-- He--

20:04.804 --> 20:06.873
You're totally
pointing at him!
[ Ben ] Which guy?

20:06.939 --> 20:09.576
I wasn't
pointing at him.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.844
- You still are.
- No, I'm not!

20:11.911 --> 20:14.281
- [ Scoffs ]
Oh, my God!
- Is he a clue?

20:14.347 --> 20:16.816
Fourth word.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.419
I wasn't.

- Yeah.
- [ Ben ] Aw, come on, Mer!

You guys are such
unbelievable jerks.

- Come on!
- What just happened?

20:26.493 --> 20:28.895
Shorty, fetch that
for me, please.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.697

how to read.

What was the answer?

The Bride Wore Black?

20:40.172 --> 20:42.675
- Thank you, Amy.
- I--

20:42.742 --> 20:46.546
Why do you always
have to be such a meanie?
Don't!

20:46.613 --> 20:49.582
What did I ever
do to her?

20:49.649 --> 20:52.685
You can't just let her
run you off like that.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.555
- She's just getting back at you
for taking her room.
- Oh, yeah.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.690
Some help you were
in that department.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.493
The natives would never
dream of letting their god
sleep on a couch.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.430
Not when they have me
to blame.

21:03.496 --> 21:07.900
- Meredith, now you're being--
- I am not a completely
ridiculous person, Everett.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.138
I can see you beginning
to look at me like they do.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.174
No. It's not true.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.677
Isn't it?

21:17.744 --> 21:20.813
You're telling me
you're not wondering...

21:20.880 --> 21:22.682
why you brought me here,

21:22.749 --> 21:25.084
that you're not
beginning to have doubts?

21:25.151 --> 21:26.853
No.

21:26.919 --> 21:30.423
That you-- you don't...
wish I were different?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.325
Different?
Different how?

21:33.893 --> 21:35.662
Ow.
Here.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.064
Hey. Hey.
I was joking.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.768
I was just joking.

21:43.670 --> 21:49.241
I wouldn't want you just because
you were a good guy who
got caught up in something...

21:49.308 --> 21:52.044
and then
couldn't find the break.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.113
Hey.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.048
I'm not a good guy.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.720
Yes, you are.

22:02.288 --> 22:05.892
He's coming for that ring.
That's what he wants
to talk to me about.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.828
He intends to give that girl
my mother's wedding ring.

22:08.895 --> 22:11.097
Well,
what I don't understand...

22:11.163 --> 22:13.065
is what he sees in her.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.967
[ Giggles ]

22:15.034 --> 22:18.771
See, I was on to you,
Mr. Oh-So-Innocent.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.674
No, I don't mean that.
She's attractive.
She's intelligent.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.810
[ Laughs ]
Obviously successful.

22:23.876 --> 22:27.279
She's better mannered
than any one of us.
Oh, give me a break.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.817
You stick a silver spoon
up any monkey's butt, it's bound
to go "please" and "thank you."

22:30.883 --> 22:32.719
Big deal.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.755
She is a fine woman.
Oh, so, fine!

22:35.822 --> 22:39.258
She doesn't seem to know
or trust herself very well.

22:39.325 --> 22:42.228
Thank you, professor.

22:42.294 --> 22:47.834
Which means, I'm afraid,
that our Everett
may not know himself at all.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.629
You're up early.

Did you sleep
all right?

23:18.698 --> 23:21.133
Thank you.
Has Everett woken up--
It's freezing.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.135
Whew.
Is there coffee?

Good morning, Amy.

Hello,

Good morning.

I meant to tell you,

23:44.123 --> 23:46.325
we got a card
from the Stevensons
the other day.

23:46.392 --> 23:49.195
- You remember Brad, don't you?
- [ Chuckles ] Very funny.

- Still in town,
still available.
- Yeah, well--

Amy's cherry.

Oh.

Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
Is that not accurate?

24:04.977 --> 24:06.979
Poor guy's
still holdin' out for her.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.716
Guess he got a taste
of something he liked.
Okay, Mom--

- Hmm?
- Could you not?

you take milk?
Yeah.

Um, I'm really sorry
that you had to sleep
on the couch last night.

take turns.

what I did to you.
I really don't.

whether you like me or not.

Something about
having a bad back.

to put a board
under her mattress at the inn.
