WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.238
* Whoo!

00:04.272 --> 00:08.709
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

00:11.145 --> 00:12.713
(coughing)

00:12.746 --> 00:14.215
BURT:
Does the song

00:14.248 --> 00:15.249
"Glow Worm"
by the Mills Brothers

00:15.283 --> 00:16.484
mean anything to you?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.319
No.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.388
Go get the record player.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.191
Maybe it'll shake
something loose.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.127
Oh, hey, look. Here's
the recipe for your
mother's pasta sauce.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.163
"Fill your dress full of
the neighbor's tomatoes,

00:29.197 --> 00:32.066
"add five bottles
of homemade red wine--

00:32.100 --> 00:33.567
"drinking as you go--

00:33.601 --> 00:35.536
"finish off with
a fistful of garlic

00:35.569 --> 00:37.771
and three pounds
of ground varmint."

00:37.805 --> 00:39.707
Any of that jog
any memories?

00:39.740 --> 00:41.542
Uh...

00:41.575 --> 00:43.111
no.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.179
Hey, happy Mother's Day.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.514
Thanks.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.616
What's with all the stuff?

00:48.649 --> 00:50.084
Your father and I
thought it'd be a nice

00:50.118 --> 00:51.719
Mother's Day
gift for Maw Maw

00:51.752 --> 00:53.554
if we helped her remember she
actually had a mother once.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.289
But so far,
we're not having any luck.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.091
We can't find
any pictures of her.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.261
I'm telling you, I don't
think I had a mother.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.295
Maybe she didn't.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.763
I mean, none of
us ever saw her.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.865
Maw Maw is pretty old.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.634
Maw Maw,
you might be the first woman.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.536
It's possible.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.703
She had a mother.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.105
Her name was Norma June.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.473
Hey, where's Sabrina?

01:12.506 --> 01:14.108
Oh, she's still
outside with Hope.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.376
She's trying
to track down her mother

01:15.409 --> 01:17.645
so she can wish her
a happy Mother's Day.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.313
No, I don't want
to order takeout.

01:19.347 --> 01:22.550
I, uh... I have a hotel from
Beijing on the other line,

01:22.583 --> 01:25.119
and I was wondering if you
could tell me how to say

01:25.153 --> 01:27.255
"Is my mother there?"

01:27.288 --> 01:29.157
Fine, I'll take an
order of egg rolls.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.493
* Shine, little glowworm,
glimmer, glimmer... *

01:32.526 --> 01:34.128
Keep playing it, Burt.

01:34.162 --> 01:34.995
Is it your mother, Maw Maw?

01:35.028 --> 01:37.131
Does this song
remind you of your mother?

01:37.165 --> 01:38.299
No, my father.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.202
He used to play this
record all the time.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.636
And-and-and we
would dance all...

01:42.670 --> 01:44.205
Burt, turn it off.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.240
Maw Maw, why don't you
go in the backyard

01:46.274 --> 01:48.142
and see if you can get us
a varmint for dinner.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.244
On it.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.747
At least now we know
we can jog her memory

01:53.781 --> 01:55.583
if we find the right thing.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.519
Hey, um, can I borrow
this little box?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.188
Yeah, I guess. Why?

02:00.221 --> 02:02.190
Well, I was
going to save it

02:02.223 --> 02:03.757
for Mother's Day
dinner, but...

02:03.791 --> 02:06.260
I'm pretty excited
about it, so...

02:06.294 --> 02:08.296
Here.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.263
Check it out.

02:09.297 --> 02:12.200
Hope made it
at daycare.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.168
Oh, my God.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.603
I love it.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.505
I absolutely love it.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.772
I'm never taking it off.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.641
Oh, Mom, yeah,

02:20.674 --> 02:21.875
the necklace
isn't for you.

02:21.909 --> 02:22.876
It's for Sabrina.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.379
Excuse me?

02:26.714 --> 02:30.618
Uh... it's
for Sabrina.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.720
I'm going to give it to her
at-at dinner tonight.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.190
That's... that's why I'm
going to put it in the box.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.392
Uh, well... (chuckles)

02:38.426 --> 02:41.362
I feel stupid.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.264
Here you go.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.798
All right, hey, you know,

02:44.832 --> 02:47.968
I'm-I'm sorry that you
thought it was for you.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.837
Hey.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.372
JIMMY: Hey, did you get
in touch with your mom?

02:51.405 --> 02:54.408
Uh, not yet.
From what I can tell,

02:54.442 --> 02:56.544
she's on a tandem bike tour
of the Great Wall of China

02:56.577 --> 02:57.745
with some guy named Ping.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.681
(animals squealing
and chittering)

03:00.714 --> 03:02.383
I couldn't find a varmint.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.752
But I found three critters
and a rascal.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.557
Beef jerky, kettle corn

03:09.590 --> 03:11.592
and soda.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.394
Well, that's got
diabetes and road trip

03:13.427 --> 03:14.695
written all over it.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.330
Where you headed?
Up to Hagerstown.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.831
Gonna take some pictures
of the house

03:17.865 --> 03:19.400
Maw Maw grew up in
and see if it

03:19.433 --> 03:20.668
shakes loose any memories
of her mother.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.570
Huh, I was going to take
a road trip today, too.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.872
Visit my two moms
for Mother's Day.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.674
But they canceled
to go outlet shopping.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.276
Flannel Dome's
having a big sale.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.444
Yeah, looks like
Barney spent a weekend

03:30.478 --> 03:31.912
in Washington marching

03:31.945 --> 03:34.848
to give them the right
to break my heart.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.417
You know,
if you want some company,

03:36.450 --> 03:37.751
I'll be glad to come along.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.853
Uh, why not?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.789
Always nice to have
some company in the car

03:41.822 --> 03:44.258
in case a duet
comes on the radio.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.694
Frank, you're in charge.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.462
I'm not sure
if I'm up to it.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.730
Today's Mother's Day,

03:49.763 --> 03:51.732
and I haven't talked
to my mom in...

03:51.765 --> 03:53.967
Frank, suck it up.
Nobody cares.

04:02.810 --> 04:06.414
I'd like to drive on the way
back, if you don't mind.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.548
Not that I didn't
enjoy the excitement

04:07.581 --> 04:09.350
of beating that train
at the crossing,

04:09.383 --> 04:11.251
but you can only turn your
underwear inside out once.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.324
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.625
I'm just taking
a few pictures.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.427
Actually, I was wondering
if I could take

04:19.460 --> 04:20.828
some pictures
inside, too.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.331
My wife's great-grandmother
used to live here.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.898
Her name's
Norma June Mayfair.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.402
What the hell do you want?

04:28.436 --> 04:29.737
Nothing.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.971
We don't want anything.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.072
We'll leave.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.374
We're leaving.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.742
Why did you say my name?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.009
I didn't.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.445
I said Norma June May...

04:37.478 --> 04:39.380
Wait a minute.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.081
Are you Norma June Mayfair?

04:41.114 --> 04:44.652
You bet your ass I am.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.753
(gun cocks)

04:45.786 --> 04:46.854
(gasps)

04:46.887 --> 04:48.356
I want my mommies.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.927
What you want?

04:53.961 --> 04:56.464
(stammering):
Calm down.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.466
I'm a relative
of yours.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.334
I'm married to your
great-granddaughter Virginia.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.835
Her grandmother's your daughter.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.871
I don't have a daughter.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.773
Well, Burt, I don't
think the little guy

05:05.806 --> 05:07.475
from Lord of the
Rings would lie,

05:07.508 --> 05:09.510
so I think we should
be on our way.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.345
Look, you're very old,

05:11.379 --> 05:12.880
and if you're anything
like your daughter,

05:12.913 --> 05:14.348
I'm sure your memory
isn't great,

05:14.382 --> 05:16.384
but you have a family
who loves you.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.685
They just thought you were dead.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.986
I am dead.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.655
I've been dead for 20 years.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.398
Are you an angel?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.733
Are you here
to take me to Heaven?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.067
Huh?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.437
She's a ghost, Burt.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.772
She's a ghost, and we're
the only people seeing her.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.476
Maybe we're dead, too.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.144
I bet you didn't
really beat that train

05:44.177 --> 05:46.079
at the crossing
and we got hit.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.581
Damn you, Burt.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.583
I had so much
to live for.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.984
I never saw
Breaking Bad.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.052
I was saving it.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.554
Why did I save it?!

05:53.587 --> 05:55.389
Excuse me, sir?

05:56.857 --> 06:00.561
Do you see an extremely
old woman on the porch?

06:00.594 --> 06:01.695
Norma June?

06:01.729 --> 06:03.431
Yeah, I see her.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.599
So, the shotgun
aimed at your head...

06:05.633 --> 06:06.834
not a concern for you?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.001
No, the gun's empty.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.070
We do this every day.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.406
She's harmless. Hasn't
left the house in years.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.041
She thinks she's dead

06:14.074 --> 06:15.476
and she's waiting for
angels to come get her.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.581
What kind of varmint is this?

06:20.614 --> 06:21.415
This is amazing.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.517
Maw Maw's mother is alive.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.953
Sh-Should we call Virginia
and have her bring Maw Maw here?

06:25.986 --> 06:29.189
No, no. I want that to be a
surprise for Virginia, too.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.492
This is going to be
the best Mother's Day ever.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.060
We're bringing Norma June
home with us.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.928
Norma June.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.430
Who the hell are you?

06:36.464 --> 06:37.598
Are you an angel?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.700
No, my name is Burt.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.435
And I'm going to
take you home with us.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.703
You're going to
meet your daughter.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.938
I ain't got no daughter.
Now get!

06:44.972 --> 06:46.440
Look, I know there
aren't any bullets

06:46.474 --> 06:47.541
in the gun, so...

06:47.575 --> 06:51.078
(groaning)

06:56.016 --> 06:58.519
Well, I wonder what she does
to keep in shape.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.920
She's quite spry.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.059
Maw Maw's ma sure
put a lot of red wine
in her pasta sauce.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.928
Most of the alcohol
burns off when you cook it.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.464
Even still, we should make
a separate batch for Hope.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.799
Not that drunk three-year-olds
aren't funny,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.233
but she has a hard enough time

07:13.266 --> 07:14.568
walking a straight line
as it is.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.236
Actually,
Hope's been walking

07:16.269 --> 07:17.905
pretty good
for a while.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.573
How long has it been?

07:19.607 --> 07:21.642
Sabrina,
do you remember when Hope

07:21.675 --> 07:22.576
took her first steps?

07:22.610 --> 07:24.478
Um, I'm not sure.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.646
Oh, that's right.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.648
You weren't around back then.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.750
I remember my back
always hurt

07:29.783 --> 07:32.986
from walking hunched over
holding her little hands.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.623
That was a mother of a job.
Okay, Mom.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.024
But that wasn't
anywhere near as bad

07:37.057 --> 07:39.259
as when she cut
her first tooth.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.595
Were you around for that,
Sabrina? I can't remember.
(phone ringing)

07:41.629 --> 07:43.531
Oh, it's probably my mom.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.666
It's an international call.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.767
Mom?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.636
Hi, Mr. Ping.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.871
Oh, sorry,
Ping's your first name.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.673
Can you cool it
with the questions?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.675
What? I'm just making
conversation.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.110
Filled with questions one would
think a mother should know.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.179
Sabrina knows plenty about Hope.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.514
Not as much as me.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.049
It's not a trivia contest, Mom.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.017
The macaroni necklace
doesn't go to the person

08:04.051 --> 08:06.053
who knows the date
that Hope switched from diapers

08:06.086 --> 08:08.589
to big-girl pants.
December 14.
I bought them for her,

08:08.622 --> 08:10.958
and they had butterflies
on them.
You're being insane.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.826
(sighs)
Hey, did you get
to wish your mom

08:12.860 --> 08:14.662
a Happy Mother's Day?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.697
Nope. Ping said
she's at a casino

08:16.730 --> 08:18.866
in Macao on an epic
18-hour blackjack run.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.601
She thinks, if she gets

08:20.634 --> 08:22.235
on the phone with me,
it'll be bad luck.

08:25.706 --> 08:29.677
I need some "shut up" lollipops
and Band-Aids.

08:29.710 --> 08:33.013
The neighbor kid fell
into my varmint trapping pit.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.649
(knocking)

08:35.683 --> 08:37.718
Who are you?
What do you want?

08:37.751 --> 08:39.820
* We are from Heaven

08:39.853 --> 08:41.922
* Ah...

08:41.955 --> 08:44.091
And we want you.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.327
You are, uh,
Norma June Mayfair, right?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.029
Yes.
Good.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.098
We were supposed
to pick you up years ago

08:51.131 --> 08:53.634
and take you to Heaven,
but, uh, there was a mix-up.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.602
God sends his apologies.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.905
Angels have wings
and halos,

08:57.938 --> 09:01.174
and-and their breath doesn't
smell like beef jerky

09:01.208 --> 09:02.610
and kettle corn.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.914
* Shine, little glowworm,
glimmer, glimmer *

09:06.947 --> 09:10.283
* Shine, little glowworm,
glimmer, glimmer *
Ooh.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.586
I-I... I know that song.
(humming)

09:12.620 --> 09:14.254
I think my husband

09:14.287 --> 09:16.256
used to sing it.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.092
I think I had a husband.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.628
Yes, you did.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.229
And you can see
your family again...

09:22.262 --> 09:23.964
if you come with us.
I promise.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.099
* Lead us down the
path we wander *

09:26.133 --> 09:29.069
* Love's sweet voice
is calling yonder *

09:29.102 --> 09:32.072
BURT and BARNEY:
* Shine, little glowworm,
glimmer, glimmer *

09:32.105 --> 09:34.775
* Hey there,
don't get dimmer, dimmer *

09:34.808 --> 09:38.746
* Light the path below, above
and lead us on to love *

09:38.779 --> 09:40.247
Hey!

09:41.281 --> 09:42.683
Virginia!

09:43.717 --> 09:45.018
Virginia!

09:46.854 --> 09:48.221
I got a surprise for Maw Maw.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.757
I got a surprise
for everybody.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.759
Did you get pictures
of the house?

09:51.792 --> 09:52.525
Better.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.361
(singsongy):
Look what I found.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.831
(gasps)
Burt, what is that?

09:57.865 --> 09:59.266
It's your
great-grandmother.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.768
She's alive.

10:00.801 --> 10:01.702
What?

10:01.735 --> 10:03.771
So you're God and...

10:03.804 --> 10:05.706
this is Heaven?

10:05.739 --> 10:08.308
I gave up 5,000
Sunday mornings for this?

10:08.341 --> 10:10.944
But it can't be her.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.148
She'd have to be...

10:15.182 --> 10:16.183
104. Yep.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.351
(indistinct conversation)

10:18.385 --> 10:19.920
Who are you two ragamuffins?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.822
Good Lord.
What is that?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.190
It's your
great-great-grandmother.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.659
Happy Mother's Day,
everybody.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.700
Mom?

10:32.733 --> 10:35.035
Barbara June?

10:39.873 --> 10:41.709
You!

10:41.742 --> 10:42.810
You.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.712
(growling)

10:47.247 --> 10:49.049
Oh, my.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.123
You wrinkled prune!

10:56.156 --> 10:59.026
You dim-witted
nincompoop!

10:59.059 --> 11:00.360
Nincompoop?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.763
How dare you call me the...

11:02.796 --> 11:03.997
(whispers):
N-word?

11:04.031 --> 11:05.766
Stop it.
This is crazy.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.035
Why do you two
hate each other so much?

11:08.068 --> 11:09.236
I'll tell you why.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.972
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.741
You don't remember yesterday.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.743
Good point.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.078
But I remember this.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.448
My mother sent me out
to buy some heating oil.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.856
The man said he'd bring
the oil to the house,

11:28.889 --> 11:30.758
but I was flim-flammed.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.062
On the way home, I saw
a new movie was opening,

11:35.095 --> 11:37.030
but I didn't have any money,
so I used

11:37.064 --> 11:40.433
my feminine wiles
to get in for free.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.370
When I got home,
my mother was furious.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.872
She accused me of spending

11:44.905 --> 11:47.240
the oil money
to go to the movies.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.082
So I headed west
from Hagerstown to Natesville,

11:55.115 --> 11:58.385
and that was the last
I ever saw of her.

12:04.091 --> 12:07.194
So you two haven't
spoken in 70 years

12:07.227 --> 12:09.129
over a misunderstanding?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.964
There's no
misunderstanding.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.867
She stole from me--
25 big ones.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.805
So you're telling me that
this fight is only over $25?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.439
25 cents.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.274
Those were big ones
back then.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.910
(groans)

12:22.943 --> 12:24.778
Fine.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.947
This is all I ever wanted.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.216
My little girl.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.251
Mommy.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.958
Best Mother's Day ever.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.160
This is so sweet.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.398
I've got to use your john.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.167
It might be a while.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.102
I can't tell you what for

12:49.136 --> 12:51.905
'cause a lady
doesn't discuss her business.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.874
(Norma June passing gas
repeatedly)

13:01.514 --> 13:03.951
And on those notes...

13:03.984 --> 13:05.318
it's time for dinner.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.854
I'll help you set the table.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.990
Just make sure you give Hope
her favorite color dish.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.995
What are you doing?

13:15.028 --> 13:16.296
Pink's not Hope's
favorite color.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.898
Yeah, it is.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.299
No, that's just part
of a girly phase

13:19.332 --> 13:20.834
she's going through right now.

13:20.868 --> 13:24.037
Green has always been
her favorite color.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.874
It was also her first word.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.608
Except she called it "geen."

13:28.641 --> 13:29.542
It was so cute.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.543
Of course you weren't...

13:30.577 --> 13:32.612
There. Yeah, I know.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.914
Is there something
going on?

13:35.382 --> 13:36.984
Hey, you know what?

13:37.017 --> 13:39.920
Uh, I was gonna wait
till after dinner to do this,

13:39.953 --> 13:41.889
but the anticipation
is killing me.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.392
So, go on.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.227
Mmm.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.396
(gasps)

13:49.429 --> 13:52.565
Did you...? (gasps)

13:52.599 --> 13:54.935
Oh, my goodness.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.970
And look,
you even painted it

13:57.004 --> 13:59.206
your favorite color:
"geen."

14:04.044 --> 14:05.378
Jimmy, did I do something?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.881
Yep, you married
into a crazy family.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.582
I'll be right back.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.056
Leave me alone.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.592
I think you're acting pretty
silly over a macaroni necklace.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.329
It's not about
the necklace, Jimmy.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.564
The only good female
family relationship

14:24.597 --> 14:26.033
I had left
was me and Hope

14:26.066 --> 14:28.601
I barely remember my mother.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.438
Maw Maw barely
remembers anything.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.506
This was it.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.943
She was my little girl.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.045
(Norma June groaning)

14:38.078 --> 14:39.079
NORMA JUNE:
Fruitcake?

14:39.112 --> 14:41.949
When the hell
did I eat fruitcake?

14:41.982 --> 14:43.083
(toilet flushes)

14:43.116 --> 14:45.185
Hope's still your little girl.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.054
Not for long.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.356
As she grows up,
she'll never even remember

14:49.389 --> 14:52.092
the time when it
was just me and her.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.062
Sabrina will be
her mother, and...

14:55.095 --> 14:58.598
I'll just be the crazy old lady
screaming from the bathroom.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.435
Norma June,
it's been a little while.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.238
You need some help in there?

15:05.272 --> 15:06.573
Norma June?

15:10.510 --> 15:15.348
BARNEY:
Burt, could you
come here for a second?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.987
I think she's dead.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.055
Did you try
mouth-to-mouth?

15:23.991 --> 15:25.325
Uh...

15:25.358 --> 15:27.560
yeah.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.529
But maybe you should
give it a shot.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.365
Uh...

15:36.169 --> 15:38.505
Nah, she's dead.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.540
Worst Mother's Day ever.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.281
Is that fruitcake?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.454
Ah, man, do we really
need a stretcher?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.689
I'm trying to hide this
from the rest of the family

15:56.723 --> 15:58.658
so it doesn't put a
damper on Mother's Day.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.028
Can't we just Weekend at
Bernie's her out of here?

16:01.061 --> 16:02.529
(Burt laughing)

16:05.098 --> 16:06.466
Shouldn't we tell
Barbara June?

16:06.499 --> 16:07.700
It's her mother.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.003
(sighs)

16:11.304 --> 16:13.173
(gasping)

16:18.045 --> 16:20.047
Maw Maw.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.314
Chow time, warden?

16:21.348 --> 16:24.217
Do you have a mother?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.054
Nope.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.727
As long as she doesn't see
her again, I think we're good.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.567
Hey.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.802
Hey.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.505
(sighs)

16:46.673 --> 16:48.175
I want you
to have this.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.643
No. That's yours.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.046
Hope made it for you.
Jimmy wants you to have it.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.414
I was just being...

16:54.447 --> 16:55.815
crazy.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.385
Yeah, yeah, I know.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.188
That's why I'm gonna keep
the necklace that Hope made.

17:01.221 --> 17:06.726
'Cause this one is one
that I made for you.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.062
Happy Mother's Day.
That's very sweet,

17:09.096 --> 17:11.064
but it's not
Mother-in-Law's Day.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.165
It's Mother's Day.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.401
You should give that
to your mother.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.769
Over the last few
years, you have been

17:16.803 --> 17:19.306
more of a mother to me
than my mother ever was.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.210
I want you to have this.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.713
I see what you're doing,
and it's very sweet, but...

17:26.746 --> 17:28.248
What's my favorite color?

17:28.281 --> 17:29.782
(sighs)

17:29.816 --> 17:31.084
What is it?

17:31.118 --> 17:33.153
Orange.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.089
And you know
that because...?

17:36.123 --> 17:38.791
Because, for your wedding,
you and I spent two days

17:38.825 --> 17:40.593
driving to every supermarket
in town

17:40.627 --> 17:43.463
buying all
the orange flowers.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.699
And how did I chip my tooth?

17:46.733 --> 17:50.237
You thought you could skateboard
drunk on Cinco de Mayo.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.172
And you not only
chipped your tooth,

17:52.205 --> 17:54.141
you sprained your ankle.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.243
And when did I start
walking again?

17:56.276 --> 17:58.245
(sighs)

17:58.278 --> 18:00.647
Three days later
on Ocho de Mayo.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.915
(cell phone ringing)
Oh.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.122
You should take that.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.824
(clears throat)

18:11.858 --> 18:15.262
Hello?
(music playing loudly
over phone)

18:15.295 --> 18:17.430
Hello?

18:17.464 --> 18:20.133
Mom, is that you?

18:20.167 --> 18:22.135
Mom, I can't hear you
over the music.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.208
Oh, crap.
Is this here for me?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.309
No.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.743
(sighs) Good.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.145
Bye, Jimmy.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.180
Surprised you made it this far.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.319
(groaning)

18:39.352 --> 18:41.221
Smells like someone
died in here.

18:41.254 --> 18:45.225
Yeah, I was just calling to
wish you a Happy Mother's Day.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.428
Happy Mother's Day.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.696
Oh, no, no, wait.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.931
I want you to hear this.
(button beeps)

18:51.964 --> 18:54.601
Hey, Mom?
What's my favorite color?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.770
I'm gonna guess black,
since your husband is black.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.440
Hmm, yeah,
that's my stepsister.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.542
Oh, then I don't know
your favorite color.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.377
MAN:
Say red.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.513
Red is very powerful color.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.716
Like Tiger Woods on final day.

19:09.749 --> 19:13.386
Mom, do you remember how old
I was I when I first walked?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.955
Got my first tooth
and said my first word?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.357
I don't know.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.558
If you can't remember
those things,

19:18.591 --> 19:20.260
how the heck am I supposed to?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.894
Look, I got to go.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.296
But thanks for calling.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.332
Happy birthday.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.834
No, it's Mother's...
(click)

19:28.935 --> 19:30.870
(sighs)

19:36.443 --> 19:38.445
Ah, there's my favorite moms.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.348
Hmm.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.650
Hey, aren't we missing
a table setting?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.418
Oh, uh, Norma June left.

19:45.452 --> 19:48.721
Don't tell me her and Maw Maw
got in another fight.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.491
No, uh, she left peacefully.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.825
Very peacefully.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.960
I'll give you the details later.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.964
This pasta sauce
tastes familiar.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.576
Yup, this is my mother's recipe.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.311
Do you remember your mother?

20:11.344 --> 20:13.280
Oh, yeah.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.749
We had a falling out
a long time ago,

20:16.783 --> 20:18.951
but in the end,

20:18.985 --> 20:21.421
I think we made up.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.455
(cell phone rings)

20:22.489 --> 20:24.424
Oh. Oh.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.294
Ooh, I got to take that.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.928
Save me a meatball.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.932
I don't want to gross
everybody out,

20:32.965 --> 20:35.935
but we did not make
meatballs for this pasta.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.438
Hello?

20:38.471 --> 20:39.906
MAN:
Ah, yes.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.274
Yeah, me and Lucy Liu.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.975
Lin-sanity!

20:43.009 --> 20:45.478
It's just me.
Stop it.
It's just her.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.713
Did it work?

20:46.746 --> 20:47.914
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.449
It worked.
She totally bought it.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.917
Thank you.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.420
So, your mother
never called, huh?

20:53.453 --> 20:54.321
No.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.622
I'm sorry.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.390
That's okay.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.429
I'm with my family.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.364
*

21:08.368 --> 21:12.672
* I want a mom
that will last forever *

21:14.474 --> 21:18.978
* I want a mom
to make it all better *

21:19.011 --> 21:22.081
* I want a mom to take my hand

21:22.114 --> 21:25.318
* And make me feel
like a holiday *

21:25.352 --> 21:29.489
* I want a mom
that'll last forever *
