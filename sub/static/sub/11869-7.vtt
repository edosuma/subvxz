00:01.251 --> 00:02.661
CARTER:
It was just a
normal day in Eureka.

00:02.794 --> 00:03.920
Day's not over yet.

00:04.046 --> 00:05.957
Yeah. Like that was
going to last.

00:06.089 --> 00:09.172
Hello, 1947.
Confused? Let me clarify.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.254
The five of us got
transported back in time

00:11.386 --> 00:13.422
through some wormhole thingy
thanks to the Bridge Device.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.591
We eventually found
our way back home,

00:15.724 --> 00:17.885
but, surprise, home wasn't
exactly the way we left it.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.224
Henry? Married.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.187
Zane and Jo? Never dated.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.928
But Jo's in charge
of G.D. Security.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.602
Kevin? Different,
much to Allison's surprise.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.520
And Fargo?
Head of Global Dynamics,

00:27.653 --> 00:29.234
much to everyone's surprise.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.321
Oh, and Dr. Old Spice
hitched a ride with us
back to the present,

00:32.449 --> 00:34.405
but there's one crappy rule.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.275
We can't tell anyone.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.902
If people ever found out
about our trip,
there'd be trouble.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.246
Some of us had
a harder time with it
than others.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.912
I'm not your Henry.
Not yet.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.163
HENRY: lt's way off target.
And that's a residential area.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.288
That was Jo's house,
so she's living with me
for a while.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.378
And I finally kissed Allison,
63 years ago.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.843
But, of course,
Dr. Charles Grant
had to get in the way.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.837
At least let me
buy you a drink.

00:56.974 --> 00:57.963
One drink.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.136
Don't plan the
wedding just yet.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.679
May the
best man win.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.474
But that's Eureka for you.
Same town, big changes.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.782
You know,
I think I like the hair.
Look very mature.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.200
Yeah, and it really sells
the fake ID to the bars
in Cambridge.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.494
Ah...
Kidding.
Unclench.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.004
Yeah, so when does
Lucas come back
from MIT?

01:28.672 --> 01:32.881
He's not.
Internship in Geneva,
which isn't a bad thing.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.632
Ah, you guys
having trouble?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.626
That would make it
a lot easier.

01:36.763 --> 01:40.676
No, it's just he's a
great guy, but, you know,
college changes you.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.424
What you want,
who you want.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.517
Oh, and that's
not hair boy.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.887
Maybe what starts in
the friend zone should
stay in the friend zone.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.936
Shenﬁ.
Hey,Zoe.
Hey,Zane.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.229
Looking good.
Thanks.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.655
Ooh, that's my girl.
That's my girl. Hey!

01:58.243 --> 02:01.827
Wow, Jenna's gotten
so big. Allison
seems so happy.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.779
Yeah, yeah, she does.

02:04.041 --> 02:08.660
Fresh baked cinnamon rolls,
raisin—free and icing rich.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.171
Just the way you like it.
Welcome home.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.913
Oh, thanks, Vince.
It's so good to be back.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.998
Well, I think I'll have
one, thanks, Vince.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.170
Oh.

02:17.596 --> 02:23.011
Okay, so, I think some of the
greatest romances in history
started in the friend zone.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.886
Like what?
And TV characters
do not count.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.354
So, you ready
for spa day?

02:29.483 --> 02:33.101
I've got us booked
for Shangri—La facials
and mani—pedis.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.488
What?
Shangn—La
facial?

02:35.739 --> 02:38.071
Well, this doesn't
happen by magic,
my friend.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.283
I can't wait.
So, what are you
guys talking about?

02:43.038 --> 02:46.030
Whether it's better
to stay with someone
safe, but dull.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.999
Or take a risk
on someone new.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.162
(COOING)

02:50.337 --> 02:52.578
(STAMMERING) I think
newer isn't always better.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.007
You've already
found someone new.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.548
That obvious?
Well, nothing's
happened yet,

03:00.681 --> 03:02.888
we've just been
holo—Skyping.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.725
But he's funny
and smart
and so hot.

03:06.853 --> 03:07.888
Yeah, and I think
that's my cue to leave.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.103
I'll meet you outside.
All right.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.473
(LAUGHS)
Okay. God.

03:14.027 --> 03:19.192
Funny, smart,
and hot. Sounds
like a trifecta.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.442
Yeah. I don't know,
I mean, he's
a little bit older.

03:23.787 --> 03:27.530
If he makes
YOU happy,
go for it.

03:27.708 --> 03:32.623
Life's short and
everything can
change in a blink.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.000
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

03:36.925 --> 03:40.213
Oh. That's my contractor.
Wait until you see the
plans for my new house.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.586
Zimmer, what's
going on?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.302
Let me get
your coat.
Thank you.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.733
A gentleman always
takes street side.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.891
Were all men
as chivalrous
in your day?

03:56.027 --> 03:58.018
If they wanted a
chance with a gal
like you, they were.

03:58.155 --> 04:01.113
Well, I say we
need more men
like you in 2010.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.071
You know what we
didn't have in my day?
Coffee like this.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.538
I enjoyed the highballs
the other night.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.584
The drinks?
Oh, yes. So did I.
Thank you.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.838
How about we go
crazy next time
and make it dinner?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.002
Uh, well...
Hey, guys.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.548
Uh, why aren't you
catching up on 60
years of fun facts?

04:23.847 --> 04:26.805
Because I find
the present
far more alluring.

04:27.726 --> 04:31.469
That's great.
Um, I need you.
Police business.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.139
Could take a
while.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.314
Oh, okay, sport.
Ladies, to
be continued.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.275
Police business?

04:43.408 --> 04:45.990
Well, all my
business is
police business.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.992
So what's
up, Carter?

04:48.121 --> 04:52.615
(STAMMERING) Well,
it's really more of
a longer conversation.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.413
Uh, maybe you
and I could
grab a bite.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.619
| just ate.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.216
No, not...
(LAUGHS)
Oh...

05:00.342 --> 05:03.926
"I just ate."
No, later. Like,
say, dinner?

05:05.013 --> 05:09.097
Oh. Um, okay,
well, Kevin's going
to be at Dre's

05:09.226 --> 05:12.138
and I have the
nanny tonight.
Yeah, sure, what time?

05:12.270 --> 05:14.010
Uh, say,
8:00?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.270
Yeah, that
sounds good.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.562
Okay. Hey, Jenna.
Say goodbye to Carter.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.400
(LAUGHING)
CARTER: Bye.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.486
(LAUGHING)

05:26.993 --> 05:29.245
Why'd it take
me four years
to do that?

05:31.998 --> 05:35.832
Well, tell him if he
doesn't move that thing
today, I'll move it for him.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.920
(SIGHS) They haven't even
poured the foundation
for my house,

05:40.048 --> 05:42.664
which means I get
to keep living with
the both of you

05:42.926 --> 05:45.212
and SARAH and
her mechanical boyfriend

05:45.345 --> 05:48.007
and, oh, my God,
I need my
own space.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.801
Mechanical
boyfriend?

05:49.933 --> 05:52.424
Uh, SARAH's been
spending time
with Deputy Andy.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.223
Your house is
getting more action
than either of us.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.685
So what's the
holdup on the swinging
new bachelorette pad?

05:59.818 --> 06:04.812
Some pinhead named Thurgood
found a fossil on the site
and shut down construction.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.564
Wait, Derek?
Derek?
Who's Derek?

06:07.701 --> 06:11.865
Oh, Dr. Derek Thurgood.
He taught my paleoanthropology
class last year at Tesla.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.612
The guy's
a genius.

06:13.915 --> 06:19.785
Really? Well, why don't you
come and watch me kick
his smart ass off my property.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.125
Well, let's.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.009
THURGOOD:
You don't know
what a big deal this is.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.342
I'm sorry,
you're going to have to
give us more time.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.631
You've had three
days to move it.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.882
Well, I was working on it, but
this little intimidation stunt
of yours isn't helping you.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.384
Hey, Zoe,
welcome back.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.932
Congratulations, Derek.
This is really cool.

06:38.064 --> 06:42.854
Oh, really cool. So take
your fancy laser shovel
and haul it back to G.D.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.398
Uh, it's a delicate process
and it can't be rushed.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.191
Besides, who knows what
else we might find here?

06:47.324 --> 06:49.531
What exactly did
we find here?

06:49.659 --> 06:53.447
The distal phalange of a
fifteen thousand—year old
pre—Clovis culture hominid.

06:54.706 --> 06:55.661
A pinky.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.951
What, that's it?
That's a big
deal, Dad.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.073
Come on.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.291
Then remove it.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.162
Well, lwould, but
boss lady Zimmer thought
it would be funny

07:03.298 --> 07:05.334
to push me into
Flash—Crete.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.385
Into what now?

07:10.513 --> 07:13.004
It's Flash—Crete.
PVA—enhanced
molecular—bonded concrete.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.974
Three—second set time.
And he fell into it.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.645
I had a
little help.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.602
If I'd helped
you would've gone
in face first.

07:19.731 --> 07:23.019
All right, let's get Indiana
Jones out of the wall here.
You got a chisel?

07:23.151 --> 07:24.891
(SCOFFS)
Come on.

07:25.028 --> 07:28.020
Here. It's
de—polymerizing
spray.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.230
For the
clumsy and
irritating.

07:34.996 --> 07:40.992
What about my house?
With the dojo and the firing
range in basement. It was...

07:41.378 --> 07:45.371
Ah!
See for
yourself.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.795
In Eureka, scientific
discovery always
trumps construction.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.796
It's in the
town charter.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.300
Smells orange—y.
Yeah, it's
the solvent.

07:54.432 --> 07:58.016
Dr. Fargo wanted this house
fast—tracked. What am
I supposed to do now?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.810
Go home and
brush up on
local civics.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.685
I thought she'd
never leave.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.730
You know, Derek,
if you have time I'd love
to see the distal phalange.

08:07.862 --> 08:12.481
Well, I'd love to
show it to you.
It's just over here.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.901
Carter, you have
to do something.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.902
I know, but...
...pinky.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.200
Yeah, it actually...
Are they flirting?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.366
I meant about my house.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

08:25.964 --> 08:28.501
Great, it's a 911
from Fargo.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.132
All right, Fargo,
what's the emergency?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.085
Shh...

08:35.348 --> 08:36.849
You're running
sonic protocols?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.590
Big Brother could be
eavesdropping.

08:38.727 --> 08:39.682
On what?

08:39.811 --> 08:40.800
On me.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.055
Seems my mug may have
drawn some unwanted
attention from the DOD.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.524
FARGO: They've been
snooping around
Dr. Grant's personnel file.

08:48.653 --> 08:52.737
The one I manufactured.
If they know I
falsified documentation...

08:52.866 --> 08:55.983
Then they know that
I'm not Charles Grant,
G.D. historian.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.156
But Trevor Grant, G.D.
history. We could be
in a lot of trouble.

08:59.289 --> 09:03.077
Try sanctioned.
We violated
time travel protocols.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.040
They're going to
lock us up like lab rats.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.410
I don't like the
sound of that.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.535
Forever.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.502
Or that.
What's our play?

09:12.010 --> 09:14.126
We trace the
checks directly
to their source.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.253
FARGO: Hack the Pentagon?
Are you insane?

09:16.389 --> 09:19.847
The D.O.D. mainframe
has dozens of firewalls
laced with info—mines

09:19.976 --> 09:23.264
along every data path.
It's like trying to
hack the Matrix.

09:24.689 --> 09:29.979
And, as much as it pains
me to say, we need to get
help from "The One."

09:33.990 --> 09:36.857
ZOE: Working with Derek
is a chance to
be part of history.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.235
CARTER: You really
want to hang with "Mister
I found a pinky"?

09:40.371 --> 09:42.077
I thought you
and Jo were
going to the spa.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.447
Oh, she
postponed.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.868
You know, plus Derek
and I have time

09:45.001 --> 09:47.743
at the AMS lab
tomorrow to start
carbon dating.

09:47.879 --> 09:51.963
You know, that skeleton
could be the oldest North
American hominid ever found.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.832
(CARTER CLEARS THROAT)

09:56.471 --> 09:59.963
CARTER: So?
Speaking of dating,
check you out.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.635
Thank you.
Hold on,
photo op.

10:01.768 --> 10:06.728
Oh, your first real date
with Allison. Uh, finally.
This is big.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.814
Oh, crap. My phone's
in my bag. I must have
left it at the dig site.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.814
I got time.
I could run
you over.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.612
Great.
Great.
SARAH, door.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.292
There you go.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.797
ZOE: Oh, that's weird.
Derek's car's still here.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.466
Yeah.
Derek?

10:45.395 --> 10:46.851
I think I left
it in the pit.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.311
Be careful.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.987
Derek?

11:01.244 --> 11:02.233
(GASPS)

11:02.745 --> 11:04.406
Dad!

11:24.601 --> 11:27.343
Any chance that's
just a really good
statue of Thurgood?

11:27.478 --> 11:30.641
No, there's
definitely a person
encased in there.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.688
Prepare him for
autopsy, please.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.067
It's so horrible.
You okay?

11:37.280 --> 11:40.989
He was such an

are you going?

He would want
everyone to focus
on the find, so...

11:48.791 --> 11:50.622
I'm going to let
everyone know.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.955
Well, I've never
seen anything
like this before.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.498
Yeah.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.552

Dinner?

12:08.311 --> 12:11.678
Oh, oh. Oh, you
meant a date.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.395
Yeah,
I did.

12:13.524 --> 12:17.312
I'm so sorry,
I just wasn't
expecting, um...

got to focus,
shall we?

12:23.993 --> 12:27.360
Yeah, you're
right. Um, okay.

12:28.039 --> 12:32.282
Um, so it looks like
Thurgood was dropped
in a vat of cement.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.534
Or pushed in.
I'll go check
with Zimmer.

before, I'd never use

entire person.

13:01.155 --> 13:05.114

what you did after
I left you yesterday.

My crew cleaned up
the site and then cleared out.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.954

mucking about in his pit

when we went back
to the warehouse.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.140

is not causing
the fossilization.

you said these

know what that is.

20:41.907 --> 20:46.401
Well, I'm pretty sure that
means it's not a
pre—Clovis hominid phalange.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.079
Which would mean
I might know what's
causing Derek to petrify.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.075
Do you think you can
get me into his home lab?

21:05.806 --> 21:09.094
Well, nothing out of
the ordinary. Unless
you count all of it.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.017

looking for, exactly?

solution.

Maybe he keeps it next to his

do exactly?

Oh...

21:30.247 --> 21:31.236
Oh!

21:41.425 --> 21:43.165
I think I found it.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.172
ALLISON:
Okay, no sign of quartz
in your cellular walls.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.219
That's it?
So she's okay, then?

21:51.352 --> 21:54.094
Yes, along with
the rest of the
archeological team.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.390
Great.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.976
I can't believe
Derek was trying
to pull a Piltdown.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.395
A what down, now?

22:00.778 --> 22:03.565
Well, Thurgood's
skeleton was a
Piltdown man.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.532
An ape—like skeleton
found in England in 1912.
Turned out to be a hoax.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.616
So the skeleton
isn't real?

22:09.829 --> 22:11.865
Well, it's not
really old.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.823
It looked old.
Yeah, that's
the point.

22:15.709 --> 22:19.042
The PERM solution,
it introduces silica
and calcite,

22:19.171 --> 22:21.082
and it does
it super fast.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.374
We used it in Derek's class
to study the process
of fossilization.

22:24.969 --> 22:28.427
Yeah, but a skeleton treated
with PERM would never stand
up to radiometric dating.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.385
Yeah, unless Derek tweaked
the photon emissions rate.

22:32.059 --> 22:35.972
The quartz in the skeleton
that he found didn't look
right, so I measured it.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.221
It was like PERM
on steroids.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.566
So he rejiggered the PERM?

22:39.692 --> 22:41.102
I mean, I knew someone
rejiggered something.

22:41.235 --> 22:44.602
But now that we know
that Thurgood's PERM
is the culprit,

22:44.738 --> 22:47.730
I may be able to
synthesize an anti—serum
to reverse the effects.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.950
Question, how come some people
at the site got fossilized and
others didn't?

22:51.078 --> 22:52.067
Like Zoe.

22:52.413 --> 22:56.531
I don't know, maybe a
genetic predisposition
or an allergic reaction.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.953
I'll have the
archeological lab closed off,

22:59.086 --> 23:01.202
test anyone who
came in contact with it
at the site.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.875
Great. I'll go over there
and quarantine the PERM.

23:04.008 --> 23:04.997
Can I talk
to you for a sec?

23:07.469 --> 23:09.960
Look, I know this has
been tough on you,

23:10.097 --> 23:13.806
so why don't you get away
for a little while?

23:15.644 --> 23:17.145
To the spa? I can't go now.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.681
Look, I know there's
nothing you can do.

23:18.814 --> 23:19.769
It would make
me feel better,

23:19.899 --> 23:22.982
and by the time you get
back, Derek will probably
be his old fraudulent,

23:23.110 --> 23:24.520
flesh—colored self.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.317
How can you be so sure?

23:26.447 --> 23:28.608
I can't,
but Allison's
working on it.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.065
Thanks.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.571
So what now?
Well, the computer's
running panels on how to

23:36.707 --> 23:38.447
reverse engineer
the PERM'S effects.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.246
An antidote?
Well, that's the hope.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.494
Great, keep me posted.
Okay.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.878
Hey, could I borrow you?

23:54.016 --> 23:55.222
Um...

23:56.644 --> 24:01.684
When Grant asked you
out, did you think
that was a date date?

24:04.109 --> 24:07.146
Well, yeah, sure.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.735
Why not me?

24:14.411 --> 24:15.992
Really?

24:17.247 --> 24:19.909
Okay, um, A,

24:20.167 --> 24:21.782
you've never asked me
for a date.

24:23.087 --> 24:28.582
B, you kissed me and
acted like it never happened.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.668
I mean, I know you had
to come back to Tess,

24:32.554 --> 24:34.260

it's been over a month.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.932
You've been thinking
about the kiss?

24:39.061 --> 24:41.768
It's been over 60 years.
I don't know,
who can remember?

24:43.607 --> 24:44.938
You thought about it.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.307
Carter,

24:46.443 --> 24:47.979
go set up the
quarantine.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.397
Yes, ma'am.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.736
You did.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.579
HENRY: The soil
definitely runneth over
with modified PERM.

25:01.083 --> 25:04.120
Must have leeched from
the treated skeleton and into
the surrounding area.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.328
That's it. We're ready?
All right, hold on.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.840
Consider the area
quarantined.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.053
Great. Thanks.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.171
You're welcome.

25:18.308 --> 25:19.468
Sorry for pulling you away
from Grace.

25:19.601 --> 25:20.590
No, you didn't.
She went out.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.722
Beach Blanket Bingo
wasn't a hit?

25:22.855 --> 25:24.766
No, it was, both times.

25:24.898 --> 25:28.857
Turns out, I took her on
the exact same first date as
the Henry from her timeline.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.193
No. She was okay with that?
Yeah. No, no.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.401
She was wonderful.

25:32.698 --> 25:36.031
I just want to give her
the passion and surprises
that she deserves.

25:36.160 --> 25:42.076
But, you know, anything
I come up with, you know,
he's probably already done.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.285
It's hard to win a girl
when you're competing
against yourself.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.079
Exactly, so what do
you think I should do?

25:47.087 --> 25:48.076
Well, um,

25:48.922 --> 25:51.174
you could find the
person you'd be least likely
to go to for advice,

25:51.341 --> 25:53.468
and ask them.
I thought that's what
I was doing.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.926
I walked right into that one,
didn't I?
Mmm—hmm.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.466
(BOTH LAUGHING)

25:58.599 --> 25:59.930

26:00.059 --> 26:01.595
Thanks, Jack.
Good luck.

26:05.939 --> 26:06.928
Hmm.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.183
I can't relax. Derek...

26:11.361 --> 26:14.945
Is in the best hands
possible. Trust me.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.360
(LAUGHS) Okay.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.609

26:23.248 --> 26:24.704
I'm really glad
you were here, Grace.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.334
Yeah, me, too.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.499
All right, so tell
me all about Harvard.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.999
Guys, grades,
I want all the gossip.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.126
Grades are good,

26:33.759 --> 26:36.922
guys are complicated.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.841
"Guys," as is someone new?

26:40.224 --> 26:42.431
Well, he's not exactly new.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.847
I needed help with a
physics model last semester.

26:47.064 --> 26:50.397
He totally knew how to use
an Ornstein—Zernike equation

26:50.526 --> 26:53.142
in molecular—electronic
structure theory.

26:53.487 --> 26:56.069
Okay, that is hot.
Right.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.899
It's that rush you get
when you're first getting
to know someone, you know?

27:00.410 --> 27:01.490
Yeah.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.033
(SIGHS)
It's too bad
you can't have both.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.870
Yeah, too bad.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.372
(BEEPING)

27:18.387 --> 27:20.753
What happened?
Derek's system is
shutting down,

27:20.889 --> 27:22.925
I'm losing him.
I thought you were
onto something with the PERM.

27:23.058 --> 27:26.550
So did I, but the new
compound didn't reverse
the petrification.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.060
ltjust slowed it down.
Wait, you were partially
right, right?

27:29.231 --> 27:32.723
Well, Thurgood and the others
must have been exposed
to some sort of bio—activator,

27:32.860 --> 27:34.942
something that
changed the PERM in some way.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.059
I'm guessing
there's lots of those?

27:36.196 --> 27:37.936
I'm gonna have to
cross—reference everything
in their system,

27:38.073 --> 27:39.233
see if I can find a match.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.981
Everything...

27:41.618 --> 27:42.949
Do they have
that sort of time?

27:43.078 --> 27:44.579
The others, maybe,
but Derek...

27:45.956 --> 27:46.945
Um...

27:47.124 --> 27:50.036
I'll ask Zoe.
Maybe she knows if they have
something in common.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.584
Zoe, hey.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.958
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

27:59.261 --> 28:00.250
Yeah.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.175
(SOFTLY) I was just
wondering maybe
if you wanted to...

28:08.937 --> 28:10.552
I don't know...

28:10.689 --> 28:13.055
Okay, yeah,
we'll talk about it later.
Okay.

28:13.859 --> 28:14.848
Shenﬁ.

28:15.819 --> 28:16.808
Zane.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.060
Zoe.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.195
That's him.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.069
Zane?
Yeah.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.079
He's the new guy?

28:30.334 --> 28:32.916
Well, I know what
you're thinking,
but he's really sweet

28:33.045 --> 28:35.627
once you get to know him.
When did you get
to know him?

28:36.006 --> 28:36.916
Just give it a chance.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.335
No. He's a train wreck.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.045
Just ask Jo.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.927
Jo? Why would I ask her?
Those two hate each other.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.514
VVeH,because
of his poor work ethic,

28:48.060 --> 28:49.516

discuss this later, okay?
Allison needs our help.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.433
Dad...
Look, something
activated the PERM.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.068
We've got to find out
what it is before more
people are affected. Come on.

28:57.361 --> 28:58.396

What, what?

28:59.154 --> 29:00.189
It's too late.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.146
I can't feel my hands.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.287
It's all over me.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.827
Just look at me, okay?
You stay with me.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.040
You look...
You're going to be okay.

29:14.336 --> 29:15.325
All right,
it's going to be okay.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.411
Damn.
What's wrong?

29:17.547 --> 29:18.957
It's blocked.
It's...

29:19.925 --> 29:20.914
Allison.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.468
Stay with me.
Look at me, all right?

29:25.806 --> 29:26.921
Just look at my eyes.

Still might be able
to get into the
sub—clavian artery.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.051
When you become a doctor,
never do that.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.226
All right, sweetie.
You're going to get sleepy.

29:36.358 --> 29:37.723
Just relax.

29:38.694 --> 29:42.152
There, see?
It's going to be all right.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.740
Is that a cure?

29:47.953 --> 29:50.569
No, but we will find one,
okay? Just stay with her.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.034
I love you.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.211

for Carter in case he spends
the night with Zoe.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.589
Is she okay?

30:12.060 --> 30:13.049
I hope so.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.761
I've got to go.
No, wait.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.064
I pulled something
off the DOD. mainframe
you need to see.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.062
It's Grant's personnel file.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.447
Two felonies in one day.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.064
Impressive.
Not as impressive
as his profile.

30:28.035 --> 30:29.024
It's a fake.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.408
What makes you think that?

30:30.537 --> 30:32.402
Come on, when you've
created as many aliases
as I have,

30:32.539 --> 30:33.528
you know what to look for.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.456
Dr. Charles Grant reads
like a textbook coverjob.

30:36.710 --> 30:39.326
Chuck's hiding something.
Like what?

30:39.713 --> 30:42.045
I don't know.
You're the head of security,
don't you want to find out?

30:43.300 --> 30:47.293
Zane, Grant went through
detailed background checks
like everyone at G.D.

30:47.429 --> 30:48.384
I did them myself.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.674
Look, I know we've had
our trust issues,

30:51.058 --> 30:53.049
but something isn't right
about this guy. I can feel it.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.509
He is Dr. Charles Grant,

30:56.396 --> 30:57.385

30:58.065 --> 31:00.056
Trust me. Look,

a papenNeight when
I started working here.

an iTablet

with the PERM.

Well, Allison,
you gave Zoe a clean
bill of health earlier.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.251
I know, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to
figure it out.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.245
I'm not blaming you,
but if Zoe was fine then,

32:47.382 --> 32:50.340
then she obviously
came into contact with
the bio—activator since then.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.961
Well, we need to find out
everything she was exposed to

32:54.097 --> 32:56.429
in the last couple hours
and that would
narrow it down.

32:59.060 --> 32:59.924
Well, I know
where to look.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.722
Yeah?

33:24.169 --> 33:25.784
On the face? No, never.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.912
The solvent is
a derivative of
my hand dip.

33:28.048 --> 33:31.165
The active ingredient in both
is limonene, it's excellent
for purifying the skin.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.041
Were Zoe's hands
dipped in the limonene?

33:33.261 --> 33:35.923
Yes, of course.
It's part of the
Shangri—La experience.

33:36.056 --> 33:36.920
Zimmer, Thurgood,

33:37.057 --> 33:38.467

I'm sensing
a "but" in there
somewhere.

33:58.954 --> 34:02.162
The antidote needs
to be absorbed
directly into the skin.

So put it in
a cream and
slather it on.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.955

has closed off Zoe's pores.

Yeah, but she's
still breathing.
Can't she just inhale it?

34:33.488 --> 34:35.649
No, the cure
must be directly
applied to the skin.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.365
But petrified tissue
is porous on
a microscopic level.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.702
If we could just
take advantage
of that somehow.

34:44.165 --> 34:47.532
Vicelli said that
her molecular steam
penetrates all skin types.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.160
Molecular steam
might be small enough
to penetrate.

34:51.006 --> 34:54.590

the cure, Vicelli might
be able to deliver it.

36:39.072 --> 36:40.562
I got you back.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.791
Oh, wow.
Petrification does
awesome things for your skin.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.999
Too bad about
the whole
almost dying part.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.121
Yeah.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.089
It was almost, right?
Derek...

37:00.218 --> 37:02.584
Yeah, yeah, he's fine.
And the others, too.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.264
It's quite
a homecoming, huh?

37:05.390 --> 37:07.346
It sure wasn't dull.
(LAUGHS)
No.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.851
How we doing?

37:09.018 --> 37:11.634
Well, I'm not garden
statuary anymore.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.223
Well, that's a good start.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.897
We're going to keep you
here for another day,
just as a precaution.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.686
And don't even
think about arguing.

37:17.902 --> 37:21.019
Hey, if it avoids being
grilled about my love life,
I'm all for it.

37:21.322 --> 37:24.814
Uh, don't count on it.
I'll be right back.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.243
I don't know
how to thank you.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.998
I'm just happy
everything
worked out okay.

37:34.419 --> 37:38.537
(CLEARS THROAT) Well,
I wouldn't say all okay.

37:38.840 --> 37:39.875
What's Zane
doing here?

37:40.008 --> 37:44.217
Apparently,
he and Zoe
are friendly.

37:44.888 --> 37:45.877
Since when?

37:46.014 --> 37:47.345
Since we changed stuff.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.680
Oh, could this
get any worse?

37:55.774 --> 37:56.854
Hey, how's our girl?

37:56.983 --> 37:58.063
Uh, she's good.
Yeah?

38:01.863 --> 38:02.852
(INAUDIBLE)

38:06.034 --> 38:07.319
I'm going to be sick.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.945
Come on.
Oh, God.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.199
She asked my advice
about her new guy.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.118
Her new guy
is my old guy.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.081
I know, I know,
you must be really upset

38:16.211 --> 38:17.872
and you probably
want to kill them.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.869
In normal circumstances,
I'd help you.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.542
Okay, but you're
not okay with this?

38:21.674 --> 38:23.380
No, no, I'm not
okay with this.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.839
And I keep telling myself
that it's a crush and
that it's not going to last.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.015
What if it does?

38:36.147 --> 38:37.808
I got to go.
Okay.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.474
(SIGHS)

38:41.945 --> 38:42.934
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

38:47.033 --> 38:48.694
Henry, listen.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.442
About lunch today...

38:50.787 --> 38:52.994
(SINGING '80s POP SONG)

39:03.007 --> 39:04.338
What is going on?

39:07.220 --> 39:11.008
You blinded me
with science!

39:11.724 --> 39:12.713
(MUSIC PLAYING)

39:16.020 --> 39:17.009
(LAUGHING)

39:26.072 --> 39:28.984
(CONTINUES SINGING)

40:13.870 --> 40:14.859
So romantic!

40:24.756 --> 40:26.997
So, Zoe's on her way
to a full recovery.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.884
Well, thanks to you.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.750
Well, it was
a team effort.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.171
You know,

40:35.558 --> 40:38.721
Zoe said that
what starts in
the friend zone

40:38.853 --> 40:42.095
should just stay in
the friend zone.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.811
Do you think
that that's right?

40:48.154 --> 40:51.817
I think that
good friends are
hard to find.

40:53.743 --> 40:55.574
So you think
the kiss was
a mistake?

40:55.787 --> 40:56.822
No.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.027
(BOTH LAUGH)

40:58.790 --> 41:01.998
I think that
what we have,

41:03.002 --> 41:05.163
it's really special.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.003
And ifthings didn't
work out between us,

41:08.132 --> 41:10.384
especially after
everything we've
been through...

41:13.054 --> 41:15.420
What I'm trying
to say is...

41:17.225 --> 41:20.592
Maybe...
Maybe it's not
worth the risk.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.552
Okay.

42:19.287 --> 42:20.527
BEVERLY: Trevor Grant?

42:28.880 --> 42:30.040
How do you know my name?

42:30.214 --> 42:31.420
I've known
your name
my whole life.

42:32.008 --> 42:35.045
I believe you knew my
father, Adam, back in 1947.

42:35.428 --> 42:36.417
Who are you?

42:38.097 --> 42:40.008
My name is Beverly Barlowe

42:41.434 --> 42:44.141
and we've been waiting
a very long time for you.
