Mom, you have to
sign my math test.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.857
No, not right now, DJ.

00:23.891 --> 00:26.294
She said by tomorrow.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.796
Hasn't Darlene taught you
to forge my signature yet?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.701
OK, there.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.802
I got a D.

00:34.835 --> 00:35.703
Yeah, I know.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.339
I'm sure you tried your best.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.673
Jeez, I'm sorry, OK?

00:39.707 --> 00:41.008
It was one time.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.910
Give me a break.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.045
DJ, I gotta drive
Aunt Jackie somewhere,

00:45.079 --> 00:47.415
so I want you to go next door,
go to the Tildons', and stay

00:47.448 --> 00:48.782
there.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.518
And then, when I get back, if
you want, I'll yell at you.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.087
OK?

00:53.121 --> 00:54.222
OK.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.623
Darlene?

00:55.656 --> 00:57.158
This is weird.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.527
I hate going to
the emergency room.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.129
It reminds me of
the pussywillow.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.397
Remember the
pussywillow, Roseanne?

01:03.431 --> 01:06.600
All I said was, I wondered
if it could fit up your nose.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.636
You're the one that
crammed it up there.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.241
Is everything OK?

01:13.274 --> 01:14.875
Jackie, could you
go start the car?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.144
I've gotta get my coat.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.077
Yeah.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.779
Here, take this chicken, too.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.514
I got barbecue sauce
in the glove box.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.219
What's going on?

01:25.253 --> 01:28.189
I'm taking Aunt
Jackie to the hospital.

01:28.222 --> 01:31.125
Fisher hit her, didn't he?

01:31.159 --> 01:34.027
I'm not supposed
to tell you that.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.964
Yeah, he did.

01:36.997 --> 01:39.800
And now, I need you
to do me a favor.

01:39.833 --> 01:40.934
OK.

01:40.968 --> 01:41.835
OK.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.505
Now, we need milk.

01:44.538 --> 01:47.475
And on your way, could
you swing by the jail

01:47.508 --> 01:48.376

Hey Dan.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.240
Sorry it took so long.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.741
They didn't have
any curly fries,

02:53.774 --> 02:56.677
so I just got the
regular Hope that's OK.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.512
Thanks, buddy.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.848
You know, everybody feels
pretty bad about you, uh,

03:00.881 --> 03:01.815
having to be in here and all.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.484
Yeah, I know, thanks.

03:03.517 --> 03:07.521
I appreciate the extra care
you showed when you frisked me.

Someone's here, Dan.
Says they know you.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.424
Finally.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.092
I'll go get started
on the paperwork.

What are you doing here?

don't have time for this.

Oh, I think you do.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.908

to the hospital,

04:00.941 --> 04:02.843
so I'm here to post bail.

that means I have

04:04.345 --> 04:06.347
to give the money

Give me the money.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.519
All right, but I
want you to know it's

04:11.552 --> 04:12.920

it on the street, you

fight over a poker game.

exactly what happened.

Now Dan, we brought
you a little something

lonely hours in the slammer.

guys in a bowling alley?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.976
I thought it was a poker game.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.112
Well, Dan, according to
the people at Buy and Bag,

06:19.146 --> 06:22.315
you went on a drunken
rampage, beat up six guys,

06:22.349 --> 06:24.852
and took out a pay phone.

saying it for years.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.529
Has the living room
always been downstairs?

07:13.066 --> 07:15.603
Now, now, don't you
be too hard on Dan.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.738
The boys will make up,
and Fisher won't even

07:17.771 --> 07:19.339
remember what Dan did to him.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.108
Huh?

07:21.141 --> 07:24.177
Dan beat up Fisher?

07:24.211 --> 07:25.546

In the bedroom?

07:28.682 --> 07:29.483
Now?

07:37.858 --> 07:38.959
So, what did you do, Dan?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.828
You went over there and
beat him up, didn't you?

07:40.861 --> 07:41.829
Only his face.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.464
Oh, Dan.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.766
What the hell were you thinking?

07:45.799 --> 07:48.268
You think you can go over
there like some Neanderthal

07:48.301 --> 07:49.537
that's going to fix everything?

07:49.570 --> 07:50.838
You had no right to do that.

07:50.871 --> 07:51.972
No right at all.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.206
You stupid jackass.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.045
I swear, Jackie, I
just went over there

07:58.078 --> 07:59.146
to scare him a little bit.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.313
Things got out of control.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.616
Everything is
out of control now.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.284
It was really sweet
of you to go over

08:04.317 --> 08:07.855
there and act like a big jerk.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.757
How-- how-- how could
you do something

08:09.790 --> 08:11.559

08:11.592 --> 08:12.392
For me.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.232
Um, I'm sorry, Jackie, really.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.969
It's just really
humiliating, though, you know,

08:22.002 --> 08:24.071
because Roseanne's always
handling my problems,

08:24.104 --> 08:25.405
and now you.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.907
Well, it's a big job.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.876
We had to expand the department.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.878
Well, you're both fired.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.213
I-- it's just that
now everybody in town

08:33.246 --> 08:35.949
is going to be
talking about this.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.785
Hey, listen.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.754
As far as everybody's concerned,
Fisher is just one of a zillion

08:40.788 --> 08:42.022
guys I beat up last night.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.657
Besides, people got better
things to talk about than

08:43.691 --> 08:45.559
what goes on in our lives.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.294
Dad, the paper's on the phone.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.896
They need a picture to
run with the article.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.097
Should I send the
one of you dressed

08:50.130 --> 08:51.464

or do you just

08:51.498 --> 08:54.635

09:06.246 --> 09:07.447

09:07.480 --> 09:08.982
Oh, um, I thought Mrs.
Conner was going to be here.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.417
I'll come back later.
- Well, that's OK.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.418
What do you need?

09:11.451 --> 09:13.320
Um, I'm here to
collect for the paper.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.354
Didn't we just pay that?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.223
Don't hit me.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.224
No, no, really.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.191
No, no, that's OK.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.092
I'll come back later.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.865
I'll be waiting for you.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.037
Dad, if kids are supposed
to tell parents the truth,

09:30.070 --> 09:33.641
how come parents don't
always tell kids the truth?

09:33.674 --> 09:34.474
Sit down, pal.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.580
I guess you probably heard
in school that I was in jail.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.515
And you're right, I
should have told you.

09:42.549 --> 09:46.253
But sometimes, see, stuff
happens, and your mom and I

09:46.286 --> 09:47.988
want to protect you from it.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.957
But you're right, I should
have been honest with you.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.026
You were in jail?

09:53.060 --> 09:55.062
You didn't know?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.097
What's all this stuff about
parents telling the truth?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.867
I was just asking.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.234
Well, I hope I
answered your question.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.405
Why did you go to jail?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.578
You see, Deej, what happened
was, I lost my temper,

10:11.611 --> 10:13.681
and I hit somebody.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.549
And hitting somebody
is a very bad thing.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.517
Who'd you hit?

10:17.550 --> 10:19.619
Well, it's not
important who I hit.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.988
Yes, it is, or you'd tell me.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.492
It was Fisher.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.494
Why'd you hit him?

10:27.527 --> 10:30.931
'Cause he was mean to
your Aunt Jackie in a way

10:30.964 --> 10:32.733
that's much different
from the way your mom

10:32.766 --> 10:34.001
and grandma are mean to her.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.542
What'd he do?

10:42.575 --> 10:44.611
He hit her, Deej.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.847
So what I did was sort of
OK, because the worst thing

10:46.880 --> 10:49.416
you can ever do is hit a woman.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.351
How come you're not
supposed to hit girls,

10:51.384 --> 10:52.619
but it's OK to hit guys?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.354
Well, you see, Deej--

10:54.387 --> 10:56.256
Rosie!

10:56.289 --> 11:00.027
Um-- uh--

11:00.060 --> 11:02.162
OK, here's the deal.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.596
It's not OK to beat up anybody.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.565
It's never OK to beat up women.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.401
But sometimes, it's less
not OK to beat up somebody

11:08.435 --> 11:11.404
who beats up somebody you love.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.107
What if a woman beats
up somebody you love?

11:14.141 --> 11:17.177
Are you at all interested in
hearing where babies come from?

[music playing]

11:21.581 --> 11:24.651
Yeah, moving day.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.553
Well, I got some
tape and some rope,

11:26.586 --> 11:28.688
so that takes care of Fisher.

11:28.722 --> 11:32.292
Uh-- I wonder what
we need to pack with.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.561
I'm just going to grab
some breakfast first.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.864
OK, well, hurry up,
because we got to get going.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.699
I left a message on your
scum-sucking ex-boyfriend's

not bring his bony ass

11:42.469 --> 11:44.537
over to that apartment
while we're moving you out,

11:44.571 --> 11:47.540
or else I'm going to
bash his skull in.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.976
Only I said it mean.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.148
Um, this isn't going to work.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.616
You know, these
boxes are too big.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.018
Because, I need small boxes.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.052
For my breakables and stuff.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.621
I can't move
without small boxes.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.957
Well, Jackie, we'll
be extra careful

12:03.991 --> 12:06.626

of NFL juice glasses.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.730
Sorry.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.499
I just don't want my
breakables to get broken.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.700
I need small boxes.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.701
God, take a pill.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.836
We'll manage.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.238
Maybe this just isn't
the best day to do this.

of the boxes, and everything.

12:20.941 --> 12:24.377
Well, Jackie, we
can get more boxes.

grocery store in this town

I was in love with Fisher,

just supposed to stop?

12:44.631 --> 12:45.933
You got it, Jackie.
Boom.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.300
Just like that.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.736
Well, I'm sorry, but I happen
to believe that maybe there

12:49.769 --> 12:51.905
is a chance that he just
might need some counseling,

12:51.939 --> 12:52.840
or something.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.174
I can't believe you.

god-blessed pathetic thing

13:00.047 --> 13:01.414
I've ever seen.

13:01.448 --> 13:05.953
I know you're just saying that
cause you're worried about me.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.821
See, there you go again.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.157
I'm being totally
insensitive, and you're

13:10.190 --> 13:11.925
making excuses for me.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.393
God, you're such an idiot.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.995
Why are you attacking me?

13:15.028 --> 13:17.164
Because I'm sick of
hearing this from you!

13:17.197 --> 13:18.866
It's the same crap
we used to say

13:18.899 --> 13:19.933
about Dad when we were kids.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.534
It's not the same thing.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.203
It is too the same thing.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.572
You can't have a
decent relationship

13:25.605 --> 13:27.975
because you're still looking for
the same kind of relationship

13:28.008 --> 13:29.409

13:29.442 --> 13:30.343

Hey, I didn't
say I was healthy.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.651
Obviously, I have
some unresolved anger.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.553
We are so aware.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.689
You know, it's really
easy to see things clearly

13:42.722 --> 13:44.791
when you've been married
20 years to a guy like Dan.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.692
Hey.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.060
I lucked out.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.863
I had lots of boyfriends before
Dan that treated me like crap,

13:49.897 --> 13:51.664
and I kept on going
back because I didn't

13:51.698 --> 13:53.500
think I deserved any better.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.835
But I learned my
lesson, and you didn't.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.105
You are an amazing and
wonderful person, Roseanne.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.107
I wish we could all be like you.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.410
I wish we could all be
a happily married couple

14:18.491 --> 14:20.793
All right, fine.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.130
I'll tell you what.

If you can go to a mirror,
and look at those bruises all

14:26.299 --> 14:29.102
over your back, and then tell me
that you still want to go back

14:29.136 --> 14:31.304
to Fisher, well, I'll
get my car and I'll drive

14:31.338 --> 14:32.239
you over there to him myself.

14:34.942 --> 14:35.742
No you wouldn't.

14:38.778 --> 14:39.579
OK, I lied.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.421
You're right.

much time we could

that in your mind as a given?

Well, I think I
about got everything.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.038
You got a cord for this?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.206
That's not mine,
that's Fisher's.

15:09.676 --> 15:10.743
Hey, what about this?

15:10.777 --> 15:12.145
Is this yours?
- That's mine.

15:12.179 --> 15:12.980
Damn.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.149
You got anything else?

15:16.183 --> 15:18.685
Well, I just got a few
clothes in the bedroom.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.852
OK, I'll go in
there and get them,

15:19.886 --> 15:21.421
and then we can burn the bed.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.964
Hey.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.565
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:32.599 --> 15:33.466
I want--

15:33.500 --> 15:34.867
I want to talk to you.
- No.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.003
Roseanne's in the bedroom.
Get out of here.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.071
Well, I was worried about you.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.172
Are you OK?

15:39.206 --> 15:40.540
Yes, I'll be all right.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.908
God.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.678
Jackie, what can I do to
show you how sorry I am?

15:45.712 --> 15:47.480
Well, getting my
brother-in-law arrested

15:47.514 --> 15:49.316
was a really good start.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.018
Look, I already
dropped the charges.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.319
I was angry, I was confused.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.121
The neighbors called the police.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.622
I didn't know what to do.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.956
You look terrible.

15:56.990 --> 15:57.790
Thanks.

16:02.329 --> 16:07.734
Jackie, you remember how great
things were when you moved in?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.402
Let's not throw all that away.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.871
Don't you think I want
things back to normal?

16:11.904 --> 16:13.140
I thought I was going
to move in here,

16:13.173 --> 16:16.209
I thought we were
going to get married.

16:16.243 --> 16:20.947
Jackie, I think
I got everything.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.082
Get out.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.116

harder than I thought.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.095

16:35.128 --> 16:38.065
You know, I consider myself
a pretty good judge of people.

16:38.098 --> 16:42.069
And that's why I don't
like none of them.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.636
But I liked you.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.173
In fact, I pushed Jackie to
get back together with you

16:46.206 --> 16:47.974
after you all broke up.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.810
And you just snuck right
under my radar, man.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.313
And that just pisses me off.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.615
Roseanne, I know
you're upset with me.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.151
But you gotta understand--

16:58.185 --> 17:00.887
I really hate myself for this.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.091
Oh, that's good.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.726
And I really hope that you
get your life together.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.496
But if you don't, I hope the
next brother-in-law kills you.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.434
You say goodbye, Jackie.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.103
Give me a second.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.571
She's an adult. Maybe
she doesn't want to leave.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.006
Maybe you should
stay out of this.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.574
You have to let
me talk to him.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.176

talk to him about.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.813
Oh, God.
Can I think for myself?

17:26.846 --> 17:29.216
What, are you thinking
of staying with him?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.683
Why don't you just
marry him and then

17:30.717 --> 17:33.353
have a whole bunch of kids, so
he can smack them around too?

17:33.386 --> 17:34.487

OK, sorry.

I didn't realize that this was
the kind of sick relationship

18:01.148 --> 18:03.082
you were looking for.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.852
Maybe I was wrong to try
to help you get out of it.

it is you're going to do,
