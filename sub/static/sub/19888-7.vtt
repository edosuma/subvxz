Hey, you're finally awake.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.367
You were expecting
someone else?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.802
-I...
-I won't take it personally.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.204
You had a rough couple days.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.672
We were both relieved

01:11.705 --> 01:14.742
when your fever
finally broke last night.

-Both?

Hey. Hey, Henry. (CHUCKLES)

You're Henry?

01:25.753 --> 01:26.820
Who else would I be?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.757
You always said that
if we had a boy,

01:29.790 --> 01:31.325
we'd name him Henry.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.761

No. He said some stuff.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.862
I think I heard the name Henry
and then nothing.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.897
He looks bad, Bajie.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.467

05:09.710 --> 05:10.778
Is she pretty?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.046
Her name's Artemis.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.648
I met her when I was playing
in the woods.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.751

just gonna let him die?

about the Abbots

06:59.720 --> 07:00.954

Now, the Abbots
did this to him,

to undo it.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.836

who knows is the Master

She's got these old scrolls
in her chamber.

is in one of them.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.474
Yeah. She also told me
Azra didn't exist,

so Sunny
was gonna help me find it.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.912

he gonna do that?

from the filth of the fields

and...

And the greasy stench
of the kitchen

to the velvety heights
of the Barony.

from that pinnacle

Your cunning, ooh!

23:16.195 --> 23:17.864

23:18.598 --> 23:20.166

always so pragmatic,

even to the point of,

23:21.501 --> 23:23.803
of marrying my weak,
traitorous son.

Why not admit it?

23:26.573 --> 23:28.975
The only difference
between us is that,

23:29.208 --> 23:31.811
is that I'm honest

in marrying you.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.852
I loved your son.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.054
Maybe his weakness

23:42.088 --> 23:43.890
was that he was able
to love me back

-more than you love yourself.

resent most, isn't it?

That he wasn't a stone-hearted
machine like you.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.756

He will become you,
and that will be your legacy.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.277
Stand back.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.879
Or what? You'll kill me?

34:40.912 --> 34:42.781
You already did,
don't you remember?

34:43.215 --> 34:44.783
You killed me and my brother

34:44.816 --> 34:46.385
in the same
careless sword stroke.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.654
We're nothing but black lines
on your back now.

34:49.555 --> 34:51.657
Still don't remember?
Maybe this will help.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.880
ARTEMIS:
They're all your victims.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.416
You can't even remember
their faces.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.720
But yours was the last one
they ever saw.

35:45.577 --> 35:46.678
His tattoos, they're bleeding.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.781
All right. Uh, quick.
Pass me a needle.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.283
-M.K.: Okay.
-BAJIE: Load it up. Quickly.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.353
Heart, brain, lungs, liver,
kidney, that's five.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.421
Whoa, come on!

35:55.754 --> 35:56.855
-Here, here.
-Uh, okay.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.859
I really hope this works.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.249
I saved your life.

Well, I mean,
we saved your life. He helped.

How do you feel?

37:39.925 --> 37:42.828
-Just appreciating the day.
-(CHUCKLES)

37:42.861 --> 37:44.696
Funny how much
you take for granted.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.997
Yeah. Well,
you'll have some time

37:46.031 --> 37:47.833
to rest on the drive.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.404
Bajie says he has a plan
to get us into the wall.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.005
(LAUGHS)

37:55.941 --> 37:56.942
What?

37:57.943 --> 37:58.944
If it weren't for him

37:58.977 --> 38:00.679
you wouldn't be alive
right now.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.013
Yeah, but I bet
it wasn't his idea

38:02.047 --> 38:04.316
to go back to the Monastery.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.619
I... I couldn't lose you, too.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.789
You're the closest thing
I have to family, so...

38:13.792 --> 38:14.826
Thank you.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.029
Of course.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.466
You did good.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.352
-BAJIE: How's he doing?
-I think he's okay.

38:40.386 --> 38:43.455
He's resting.
Bruises are already fading.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.725
Good. We can soon get back
to him belittling my morals

38:46.758 --> 38:48.994
and telling me
I'm a useless piece of crap.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.597
You're not
a useless piece of crap.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.600
A loud mouth piece of crap
maybe,

38:54.633 --> 38:56.968
-but definitely not useless.
-(CHUCKLES)

39:01.507 --> 39:03.041
Sorry about Flea.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.778
I'll find her one day.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.417
I... I thought she was...

39:11.450 --> 39:12.984
Still a pin cushion?

39:13.018 --> 39:15.020
No. No, I got her out.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.054
How?

39:16.955 --> 39:19.391
Let's say I found
a spiritual loophole.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.092
Yeah.

39:22.661 --> 39:24.896
I used my gift
to bring her back.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.466
Why do you think
I can't do that shit anymore?

39:27.999 --> 39:29.835
What happened to her?

39:30.636 --> 39:33.505
Well, I freed her from
the needle room

39:33.539 --> 39:36.642
and, um, she ran.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.145
She had to run,
right there and then.

39:40.946 --> 39:43.682
(CHUCKLES) I promised her
I'd find her again,

39:44.716 --> 39:45.984
but no luck.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.588
The Badlands is the only place
I haven't looked.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.860
I should check on him.
