[cell door slams]

01:19.204 --> 01:22.207
This must be what
the Maasai tribesmen feel like

01:22.290 --> 01:23.708
after they've speared an elephant.

01:23.791 --> 01:26.378
Except white men aren't
exactly an endangered species,

01:26.461 --> 01:29.839
and this animal is going to wake up.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.426
[grunts] Ah, he'll be out
for a couple hours.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.804
-Where the hell are we?
-[scoffs] It's a long story.

01:36.888 --> 01:40.267
-What do we do when he wakes up?
-We torture him into a confession.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.852
Don't you think that we have all
already suffered enough

01:42.935 --> 01:45.480
in service of your revenge scheme, Red?

01:45.563 --> 01:47.649
Did he do that to you? [sighs]

01:47.732 --> 01:49.442
I think you need to go lie down.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.404
-I'm fine.
-You are not fine. No one here is fine.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.989
You don't look so good either, Red.

01:55.573 --> 01:59.786
Yeah, Red, that terrifying clown look?
Doesn't really work on anybody.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.009
-You have something to restrain him?
-Something? I got everything!

02:15.092 --> 02:16.553
But we should move him.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.932
Let's get him down into the pool
so we have room to work, just in case.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.934
Girls, give me a hand. We'll carry him.

02:23.017 --> 02:25.687
-Yeah, I'll get right on that.
-You know my right knee is for shit.

02:25.770 --> 02:30.275
It's difficult for me to condone violence,
even if it's him.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.570
Nicky, please.

02:33.653 --> 02:37.031
If we don't get his confession,
this was all for nothing.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.909
Don't make me beg.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.958
How many times has this woman
been there for you, huh?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.419
Even if it's just
an extra fucking cup of Jell-O.

02:49.502 --> 02:53.005
And, yes, she is withholding,

02:53.089 --> 02:56.593
and not the archetypical mother
you spent your whole life wishing you had.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.763
Regardless, we ain't gonna
get through this shit alone.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.432
See, that much I know.

03:03.808 --> 03:04.892
[Norma sighs]

03:04.976 --> 03:08.145
Why don't you go upstairs
and get some Tylenol or something, okay?

03:08.230 --> 03:10.189
And I will deal with this.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.816
-I'm fine--
-Go.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.402
[Alex grunts softly]

03:16.988 --> 03:19.699
-[Piper sighs]
-[Frieda] On my count.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.327
One, two...

03:22.410 --> 03:26.664
Three years without a Pap smear,
Ms. Figueroa.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.125
I figured it's healthier for Duchess
to go without 'em

03:29.208 --> 03:33.713
than to subject her to that old pervert
they be calling a doctor.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.299
You know what he did the one time I went?

03:36.883 --> 03:42.555
There I am... legs spread...
breeze blowin' through my south half.

03:42.639 --> 03:47.852
He's standing there,
a good five feet away, lookin' at me.

03:47.935 --> 03:51.981
He ain't even close enough to see nothin'
where he's supposed to be lookin'.

03:52.064 --> 03:53.650
And you know what he say?

03:55.109 --> 03:56.944
"Shame about your legs.

03:57.028 --> 04:00.365
At least they let
women wear pants these days."

04:00.448 --> 04:04.661
And now I know the fucker blind 'cause
I got some fine-ass legs right here.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.829
-[stammers] I hate myself for asking...
-[Taystee pants]

04:06.913 --> 04:10.750
...I really, really do. But... Duchess?

04:10.833 --> 04:14.211
[grunts] Yeah.
'Cause my nay-nay be noble.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.632
-Of course.
-You ain't got a name for yours?

04:18.841 --> 04:22.345
What are the chances
of getting a cup of coffee?

04:22.429 --> 04:23.638
[Taystee sighs]

04:24.639 --> 04:26.140
-Hey, Mr. C...
-[sighs]

04:26.223 --> 04:28.726
...your girlfriend got a name
for her pussy?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.271
Tracy.

04:31.354 --> 04:35.107
-[Taystee laughing]
-Go fuck yourself, Joe!

04:35.191 --> 04:37.068
And she's not my girlfriend.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.363
[chuckles] Okay, I got to know
where this one come from.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.989
I told you mine.

04:42.073 --> 04:46.453
Yo, you tell me, then we'll see about
getting you some, uh, coffee.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.504
Tracy Loomis and I were best friends

04:56.588 --> 04:59.341
until she went through puberty before me
and got more popular

04:59.424 --> 05:02.594
because it was rumored
that she let David Rosen titty fuck her.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.637
-[laughs]
-So I named it after her

05:04.721 --> 05:06.764
because my vagina's a bitch.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.932
She is not wrong.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.811
[chuckles] That's some weird shit,
Ms. Fig.

05:11.894 --> 05:16.065
For real, though.
I mean, just let the girl... [chuckles]

05:16.148 --> 05:17.191
Taystee...

05:18.192 --> 05:22.322
it has been 12 hours
and we haven't gotten anywhere.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.949
-Your point was?
-Healthcare.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.244
Do you know what happens
when we get sick?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.872
A CO decides if it's essential or not.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.708
A man who don't know
or care nothin' about us

05:33.791 --> 05:36.836
tells us if we sick enough
to go to the doctor.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.756
And if it ain't essential,
you gotta lie in your bunk,

05:39.839 --> 05:41.799
hoping that your fever don't get too high,

05:41.883 --> 05:45.637
or you gotta find a friend
who can afford Tylenol from commissary.

05:46.220 --> 05:50.307
Look... last year,
a girl had an infected tooth

05:50.392 --> 05:54.353
and it took so long
for a guard to take her serious,

05:54.437 --> 05:57.106
that the infection grew
and now she blind in one of her eyes!

05:57.189 --> 06:01.528
Yeah, that's right.
She a damn pirate 'cause of this place.

06:02.487 --> 06:06.491
So you tell me that an emergency trip
to the ER ain't more expensive

06:06.574 --> 06:09.411
than getting us decent care
in the first place.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.455
-She's right, you know.
-Oh, shut up, Joe. Jesus.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.373
Fine, I will make it happen.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.875
-You win healthcare.
-[sighs]

06:15.958 --> 06:18.836
Now can someone get me
a goddamn cup of coffee?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.088
I am right on it...

06:21.338 --> 06:23.800
Tracy. [laughing] Sorry.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.342
[laughs]

06:27.219 --> 06:28.555
[indistinct chatter]

06:29.472 --> 06:32.475
I think I should slap you
and then you could slap me.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.976
[clicks tongue] I don't let nobody hit me.

06:35.102 --> 06:37.396
But it's like a sleep fighter.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.982
Gets your adrenaline goin' or some shit.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.859
-Yeah?
-Adorefins.

06:42.985 --> 06:46.781
-Do it gotta be the face?
-Hmm. Not really sure.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.534
But when my moms would try
to keep my stepdad up,

06:49.617 --> 06:50.618
it was always the face.

06:52.244 --> 06:54.205
[breathes heavily]

06:56.666 --> 06:58.375
[officers snoring]

07:01.170 --> 07:02.421
Hey!

07:02.505 --> 07:03.673
[groans]

07:03.756 --> 07:05.842
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.803
-What I told you about that shit?
-What happened?

07:08.886 --> 07:11.305
I can't help when I sleep fart.
It just slips out.

07:11.388 --> 07:13.057
-[Gloria] Ugh, that's disgusting.
-[Blake groans]

07:13.140 --> 07:14.976
-What's going on?
-Don't worry, I got it.

07:15.059 --> 07:16.728
You, long pants. Let's go.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.854
Aren't all pants long?

07:17.937 --> 07:20.607
-Didn't you hear me? I said let's go.
-I don't understand, I was--

07:20.690 --> 07:22.066
Hey, did I say you could talk?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.486
Let's go. I'm taking him to the Poo.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.363
Let's go. Close the door.
Keep your eyes on them.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.449
They're up to something.
I could feel it.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.493
Go.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.661
-She maybe got good potential.
-[Ouija grunts]

07:33.745 --> 07:35.955
We got ourselves an intern.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.749
-[chuckling]
-What's up now?

07:37.832 --> 07:39.000
[chuckling]

07:40.126 --> 07:43.170
-[grunts] You feel them adorefins?
-[groans]

07:43.254 --> 07:46.132
-Fuck! [inhaling deeply]
-[laughing]

07:46.215 --> 07:47.842
[screams]

07:53.473 --> 07:54.807
[sighs]

07:58.019 --> 08:00.312
-[Lourdes] Did you sleep?
-No.

08:01.188 --> 08:03.440
I'll go get us some coffee.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.068
I broke the vase.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.362
What?

08:08.445 --> 08:10.948
The vase...
[stammers] the one in your bedroom.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.992
It was, like, green or blue or something?

08:13.910 --> 08:15.202
That was a long time ago.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.996
I made Benny say it was his fault.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.917
I told him I'd take his Spider-Man
if he told you.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.421
You know what I remember?

08:27.381 --> 08:29.258
At the pool...

08:29.341 --> 08:32.554
You must have been nine or ten.

08:32.636 --> 08:37.683
Benny sat and watched you and your friends
dive off the diving board all day.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.394
He wouldn't even swim.
Just watched you.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.022
And then right before
it was time to leave,

08:43.105 --> 08:45.441
he ran over and climbed up.

08:45.525 --> 08:50.530
And I thought, finally...
the boy has found his guts, you know?

08:53.365 --> 08:54.826
But when he got to the end...

08:55.660 --> 08:56.828
He froze.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.121
-And what did you do?
-I went to get him.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.083
You took his hand, counted to three...

09:03.000 --> 09:05.753
and you jumped together.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.839
That's what I remember.

09:07.922 --> 09:11.008
Also the slap on the water
when he landed on his back,

09:11.092 --> 09:13.761
-and the crying, and... [chuckles]
-[sighs]

09:14.804 --> 09:16.806
But he went holding your hand.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.185
You taught him how to be brave.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.191
-If he dies--
-He's not gonna die.

09:27.274 --> 09:30.069
-But he--
-He's not going to die.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.530
I wish Mom was here.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.659
Me, too, bubbaloo.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.623
You want milk and sugar?

09:47.169 --> 09:49.839
Yo, I thought we were
taking him to Medical.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.800
We can't. Don't know how
Medical gonna help a dead man.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.802
-Then where we going?
-Man, hell if I know.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.345
This is a bad idea.

09:56.428 --> 09:59.682
Then come up with a better idea,
Your Majesty, Queen of the Obvious.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.933
This is that place.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.771
Some things happened.

10:05.562 --> 10:09.942
There's a lot of feelings
in this place. A lot.

10:10.026 --> 10:14.656
Oh! Yo, she like accidental genius
sometimes, swear to God. Yeah!

10:14.739 --> 10:17.950
[Janae] Leave him just for now, right?
Too long and that shit's gonna stank.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.869
-[Black Cindy sighs]
-What the fuck?

10:20.995 --> 10:22.204
-He died?
-[Suzanne] Oh, no.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.498
[Black Cindy] For real?
You shut the fuck up!

10:24.581 --> 10:26.959
I mean, you keep flappin'
your big ass lips,

10:27.043 --> 10:29.712
and our whole peace in
the Middle East thing? Canceled.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.963
[Suzanne] No, no, no, no, no.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.173
-No, you lied to me.
-No, I didn't--

10:32.256 --> 10:33.841
-You lied!
-[shushing]

10:33.925 --> 10:35.342
-He died!
-Don't...

10:35.426 --> 10:37.428
-[shushes] Shut the fuck--
-Lying is very bad.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.682
-Dying is very, very bad.
-Oh. Suzanne.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.684
Suzanne, I'm gonna need you
to calm down, all right?

10:42.767 --> 10:45.061
-You're a liar, liar, pants on fire!
-[sighs]

10:47.063 --> 10:49.941
You've all been fed a bunch of lies.

10:50.024 --> 10:55.947
I mean, they wanna put labels on you,
like crazy, psycho, deranged stalker.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.449
But we're not gonna
let them do that, are we?

10:58.532 --> 11:01.953
-Mmm-mmm.
-Because there is nothing wrong with you.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.915
You are perfect, just the way you are.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.043
It really is about getting up
in the morning,

11:09.126 --> 11:14.131
looking in that mirror and sayin',
"Self, you're great."

11:14.215 --> 11:19.804
That, and a little bit of lipstick,
that is all the medicine you need!

11:19.887 --> 11:22.181
Go on, get out of here. Go on!

11:23.099 --> 11:24.141
[sighs]

11:24.225 --> 11:28.604
What if your self still has a headache,
even after you tell it, "You're great"?

11:29.230 --> 11:33.234
Well, I hadn't, uh, considered
that particular situation.

11:33.317 --> 11:38.114
This is more of an anti-depressant,
anti-psychotic kinda theory.

11:38.865 --> 11:42.744
-So can I have an Advil or something?
-Well, I can't see why not.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.329
As long as it doesn't
affect your self-esteem.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.915
[chuckling]

11:47.999 --> 11:50.084
You know, I gotta say, you seem real nice.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.962
Aw, well, thank you.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.256
-Now, what is your name?
-Kasey.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.675
Well, Kasey,
it is very, very nice to meet you.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.428
Likewise. It's cool
when people surprise you, you know?

12:01.512 --> 12:05.432
I guess I assumed La Loca... [chuckles]
I mean, that's "batshit" in spic language,

12:05.516 --> 12:07.434
but here you seem real normal and nice.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.436
Oh, my mistake.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.273
Looks like we're all out of Advil. Sorry.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.692
Crazy fuckin' dago!

12:16.693 --> 12:19.030
-Move along!
-Jeez!

12:19.613 --> 12:21.532
-[all grunting]
-Someone on that side

12:21.615 --> 12:25.161
is not carrying their weight, literally.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.539
Hey, I was upfront about my knee issue.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch his head.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.500
[all grunting and panting]

12:31.583 --> 12:32.877
Fuck his head.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.796
Okay, ready?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.213
[Piscatella groans]

12:36.297 --> 12:37.339
[all grunting]

12:37.423 --> 12:42.386
One... two... three!

12:45.639 --> 12:46.640
[Big Boo] Fuck yeah.

12:46.723 --> 12:49.852
-[all panting]
-Sisterhood is powerful.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.353
[Nicky] Jesus.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.855
-He deserves it.
-[both grunting]

12:52.939 --> 12:56.192
Yeah. Call me crazy, but the morality
of this particular situation,

12:56.275 --> 13:00.404
[stammers] uh, it just sort of makes it
tricky to define who deserves what.

13:00.487 --> 13:01.780
Kind of a gray area, if you will.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.367
Here, let's put him in the chair.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.457
-[grunting] One, two, three!
-[Big Boo] Two, three.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.667
[all grunting]

13:13.750 --> 13:15.044
[Red] Wonderful.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.170
[all panting]

13:18.089 --> 13:19.673
-Thank you, girls. [sighs]
-[Big Boo exhales deeply]

13:19.756 --> 13:22.176
So, again, we're all just totally fine

13:22.259 --> 13:25.512
with the fact that we're inside
of an empty pool right now, right?

13:25.596 --> 13:27.598
Like, nobody wants to talk about that.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.350
-[grunting]
-[Anita gasps]

13:29.433 --> 13:31.518
[stutters] Yeah, I don't know
if rope will be enough

13:31.602 --> 13:34.771
to keep him properly propped.
Let me look around.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.108
[grunts]

13:37.191 --> 13:39.526
How come you have all his toys?

13:40.903 --> 13:43.072
Did you build a secret bunker?

13:43.155 --> 13:47.284
-Piper, help push him back up, would you?
-No, absolutely not.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.411
Nicky's motivational speech got us
this far,

13:49.495 --> 13:52.123
but I am not going to be a part
of whatever this is.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.084
I won't do anything he doesn't deserve.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.586
[Nicky] Wow, there it is again, huh?

13:57.669 --> 14:00.631
We're just really playing fast and loose
with that word today, huh?

14:01.548 --> 14:04.385
-This should do the trick.
-[chuckles]

14:06.095 --> 14:08.389
[Maria] You're gonna abandon everything
we're trying to do here?

14:08.472 --> 14:10.224
The mattresses are made out of vinyl.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.477
And let's get serious. You know that
some of us needed a shower anyway, right?

14:13.560 --> 14:15.187
Right, sucia?

14:15.271 --> 14:20.484
Oh, don't give up so easy, you know?
It's a storm. It's gonna pass!

14:20.567 --> 14:22.778
We heard negotiations are going real good.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.405
-What?
-Healthcare and better food,

14:24.488 --> 14:26.490
and maybe even
Beyoncé gonna come say hi to us.

14:26.573 --> 14:27.992
-Huh?
-You don't wanna miss out on that!

14:28.659 --> 14:30.661
Beyoncé ain't comin' to Litchfield!

14:30.744 --> 14:32.413
How dare you doubt her?

14:33.372 --> 14:35.416
Look! Look, guys, come on!

14:35.499 --> 14:38.460
-Move. Just walk.
-Take Dixon or Josh. Why is it me?

14:38.544 --> 14:39.586
-Fuck.
-Doesn't make--

14:39.670 --> 14:41.005
-Shut up!
-I'm the nice one!

14:41.088 --> 14:43.507
-Get in.
-[grunts] Please...

14:44.926 --> 14:47.761
Hey, now that I'm in here and everything,
can you please tell me what I did?

14:47.844 --> 14:49.096
Nothing.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.808
-Pardon?
-You didn't do nothing, all right?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.686
I got a plan. Just... Fuck.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.605
Just... just... Just trust me.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.774
Oh, yeah, I have literally zero idea
why I would do that,

15:00.857 --> 15:03.527
seeing as how you just locked me
in a shithole for no reason!

15:03.610 --> 15:07.281
Listen. You gotta be patient and wait.
I'm gonna get you out of here soon.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.866
Oh, wow.
That is less than specific.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.455
[panting] All right, listen.
Do me a favor.

15:14.538 --> 15:19.001
When I tell you it's time, go with it.
Please. Hey, got it?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.795
Yeah, no idea what you mean
when you say, "Go with it."

15:21.878 --> 15:22.879
Oh, shut up!

15:24.173 --> 15:26.717
And get ready. Fuck!

15:30.429 --> 15:32.056
[sighs]

15:32.139 --> 15:34.225
So lonely.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.395
He's not in there anymore, okay?
It's just his body.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.690
-His soul is in a better place now.
-He's in heaven, Suzanne.

15:42.524 --> 15:46.737
Hey, Cindy Rubenstein...
you don't believe in heaven.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.074
I believe you're referring
to the modern cultural Jew

15:50.157 --> 15:53.410
who typically doesn't believe
in a stringent concept of heaven and hell.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.787
However, historically,

15:55.871 --> 16:00.960
Judaism does subscribe to the idea
of Olam Ha-Ba, the world to come.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.170
Converts are always the worst.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.922
Y'all think they'll let us into heaven
after we've been in prison?

16:06.007 --> 16:08.342
Maybe this is not the time for this, yeah?

16:08.425 --> 16:09.801
It's something I think about.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.804
-Is Poussey in heaven?
-[Alison] Of course she is, honey.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.806
In my faith, we call it paradise.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.059
Hmm. I bet you she's up there right now,

16:17.143 --> 16:18.978
having a heck of a time
looking down at us,

16:19.061 --> 16:21.730
laughing about this mess
we got ourselves in.

16:22.856 --> 16:26.527
[stammers] Wait, so,
the dead bad person is up there with her?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.529
In the paradise-heaven-better-place?

16:28.612 --> 16:32.199
-Absolutely not.
-Well, she said he's in a better place.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.910
[pants] You... you...

16:34.994 --> 16:39.290
He is. It's just a different better place
than the one that P's in.

16:39.373 --> 16:43.169
Wait, so you can be a bad person
and still end up in the better place?

16:43.252 --> 16:44.753
Okay, look. Nobody knows, all right?

16:44.836 --> 16:47.839
It's just shit people say
to make each other feel better.

16:47.923 --> 16:51.593
Oh, it's too much!
[stammers] It's too much death!

16:51.677 --> 16:55.514
It's too much. And... and you're all
lying, lying, lying, lying!

16:55.597 --> 16:57.183
You liars! Oh, God!

16:58.142 --> 17:01.853
Too much death!
Too much, it's too much!

17:01.937 --> 17:03.522
That's right! You're liars.

17:03.605 --> 17:08.277
You lie. You lie! [crying]

17:08.359 --> 17:10.695
Too much! Too much death!
Too much!

17:10.779 --> 17:12.489
All right, what you wanna do
is keep 'em on their toes.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.865
Yeah, you gotta mess with their brains.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.618
-Why is your face all red?
-Oh, I slapped her to stay awake.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.247
But we good now. We got something better.
Yo, check this out.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.958
Go, go, go. All right, so, see this?

17:23.041 --> 17:26.045
You take your coffee,
then you take your card.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.922
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
And you gonna line that bitch up, right?

17:29.005 --> 17:32.093
You gotta get yourself a pen,
take it apart like this. You see?

17:32.176 --> 17:33.760
[sniffs] All right. [sniffs]

17:33.844 --> 17:35.887
[Pidge chuckles] Watch, watch.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.139
[inhales deeply]

17:37.223 --> 17:40.101
-Oh, fuck!
-[cackling]

17:40.976 --> 17:42.103
[groans]

17:42.186 --> 17:44.521
We found an extra can
in somebody's locker.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.191
[groans] Fuck, we could've used that shit
in the coffeehouse.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.611
But you know what? [sniffles]
Well, fuck it. I'm livin' in the now.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.862
[both laugh]

17:51.945 --> 17:55.324
[panting] Fuck. Shit.
Is my nose bleeding?

17:55.407 --> 17:58.119
Just a little. But whatever.
Yo, let me do a line.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.786
Come on, come on.
Fuck it. Grab that shit.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.163
[panting] Watch this shit.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.790
It's amazing.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.126
[inhales deeply]

18:06.001 --> 18:07.503
[groaning]

18:10.631 --> 18:11.673
[grunts]

18:11.757 --> 18:14.510
[panting] The more it hurts,
the doper the... the high, right?

18:14.593 --> 18:16.553
-Totally.
-I think y'all crazy.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.722
Excedrin work just as good
and it don't hurt.

18:18.805 --> 18:22.017
-The pain lets you know that you're alive.
-I know I'm alive.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.770
-You were talkin' about the guards, right?
-[Zirconia] Yeah, right.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.397
You gotta fuck with 'em.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.150
-Oh, man, this is my favorite.
-[chuckling] Yo.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.569
-[gasps]
-[Zirconia] You know how this goes.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.614
Ain't gonna happen
unless you all looking at me.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.449
I need ten eyes, right here.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.784
The slick one ain't looking yet.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.994
[Zirconia] I can stand here
all day waiting,

18:41.077 --> 18:43.622
so you better get your dude
over there in line.

18:43.705 --> 18:48.752
The longer we wait,
the more of you going to Poo.

18:52.923 --> 18:57.136
"Two Girls, One Cup."
It's a classic, but still hard to beat.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.054
[Davis sniffles]

18:59.138 --> 19:00.181
[gags and coughs]

19:00.264 --> 19:01.807
No. Fuck this.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.642
-This is bullshit!
-Uh-oh, we got a rebellion.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.228
-Oh, I got this.
-[Dixon] This ain't doin' shit!

19:06.312 --> 19:08.772
You didn't learn your lesson
from your friend earlier?

19:08.855 --> 19:10.816
What lesson?
There ain't no lesson here!

19:10.899 --> 19:13.610
Just a bunch of sociopaths torturing us,
and for what?

19:13.694 --> 19:16.655
You think getting better food
is gonna make you not a criminal?

19:16.738 --> 19:18.740
The world already considers y'all
a pile of garbage,

19:18.824 --> 19:21.785
and that was before you went and held
a bunch of innocent people hostage.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.913
You think people will be on your side now?

19:29.125 --> 19:31.295
You, with the boobs. You, too.

19:31.378 --> 19:32.504
-Me?
-[Gloria] No, her.

19:32.588 --> 19:36.675
One of you has an opinion,
the rest of you are gonna suffer for it.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.428
I was just sitting here.
I didn't do anything. Please.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.137
I'll stare at the shit eaters some more.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.389
What do you want me to do?
I'll do anything.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.057
-Out. Now!
-What?

19:44.140 --> 19:46.685
[sighs] Damn it, Dixon.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.395
-Come on.
-You're a fucking idiot.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.066
Can't let them get too comfortable, right?

19:53.149 --> 19:55.861
Nice job, Mendoza.
Mental warfare, I like it.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.280
Yeah, you a good student.
Z, help her down to the Poo.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.157
[panting] Nah. We'll be just fine.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.704
-[Pidge] Ay!
-Ooh!

20:07.163 --> 20:09.082
-[McCullough panting]
-[grunting]

20:09.958 --> 20:11.126
Get in!

20:13.962 --> 20:19.092
Move it! Move.
Move, move, move, move!

20:24.473 --> 20:26.225
[indistinct chatter]

20:34.441 --> 20:35.442
[grunts]

20:36.693 --> 20:37.694
Get in!

20:39.112 --> 20:40.947
Fuck!

20:45.369 --> 20:47.288
[both inhaling deeply]

20:47.371 --> 20:49.373
-[both grunting loudly]
-Yeah!

20:49.456 --> 20:51.417
-[growling] Fuck yeah! Fuck!
-[growls]

20:53.043 --> 20:54.085
[Gloria grunts]

20:58.340 --> 20:59.841
[panting]

21:06.807 --> 21:08.224
[rain tapping]

21:13.063 --> 21:14.981
[crying]

21:25.826 --> 21:28.745
Now, can someone tell me how
throwin' someone in a room by themselves

21:28.829 --> 21:31.373
and denying them access
to sunshine and other people

21:31.457 --> 21:34.042
teaches them any kinda lesson?

21:35.794 --> 21:37.796
-That's what I thought.
-Psst!

21:39.381 --> 21:41.550
Man, how you gonna mess up
my rhythm like that?

21:41.633 --> 21:42.843
Psst!

21:44.303 --> 21:46.262
Pardon me one second, would you?

21:47.473 --> 21:48.474
[sighs]

21:50.016 --> 21:52.311
Yo, you was killin' it in there!

21:52.394 --> 21:54.438
-[mumbles]
-Yeah. I know.

21:54.521 --> 21:57.232
That's why this better be
motherfuckin' important.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.235
Look, we got a...
a little problem. [sighs]

22:00.319 --> 22:03.405
Great, it's a little problem.
Little means you can handle it.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.198
Oh, no, no, no. Mmm-mmm.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.746
We got a dead guard
and Suzanne is freaking out.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.998
-Are you fucking serious?
-[stammers] I know, man.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.416
I know, it's bad!
Come on, I'll take you--

22:14.500 --> 22:16.377
No, you misunderstand.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.712
You think I got time
to handle more bullshit?

22:18.795 --> 22:20.088
I'm in there busting my ass,

22:20.171 --> 22:22.591
trying to make shit better
for all of us by myself,

22:22.674 --> 22:26.470
and you bringing me some nonsense?
That Suzanne is freaking out?

22:26.553 --> 22:29.222
Well, spoiler alert.
That's what the fuck she does.

22:29.305 --> 22:30.807
She freaks out!

22:30.891 --> 22:34.561
Look, I ain't got no magic Suzanne wand.
Just deal with it.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.147
Look, but... Whoa, whoa,
maybe you missed the part...

22:38.690 --> 22:40.358
[whispers] about the dead guard?

22:41.067 --> 22:43.737
Oh, you mean the part where
you thought it would be a good idea

22:43.820 --> 22:45.363
to run up in here and tell me some shit

22:45.447 --> 22:49.034
that can make this whole thing fall apart
if somebody heard you?

22:49.117 --> 22:51.537
You smart, man.
You a damn genius.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.872
You ain't got to be mean about it.
Shit, man!

22:53.955 --> 22:55.582
Do you get what's going on here?

22:55.666 --> 22:57.250
-Oh.
-Do you understand what's at stake?

22:57.333 --> 22:59.878
This ain't a game, yo. This is our life.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.298
What's going on in there is gonna change
the lives of hundreds of women.

23:03.381 --> 23:09.638
And maybe if we do this right,
other prisons will listen, too, all right?

23:09.721 --> 23:11.848
We got a chance to really change things.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.475
And I'm in there
tryin' to make a difference,

23:13.559 --> 23:14.768
and you know what?

23:16.478 --> 23:19.648
I'm good at it. I'm getting somewhere.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.944
So you tell me what's more important...

23:24.486 --> 23:29.240
one girl who can't handle
not getting her breakfast on time

23:29.324 --> 23:33.454
or the rest of us who is in here
tryin' to survive every day?

23:33.537 --> 23:34.746
[sighs]

23:39.209 --> 23:40.502
That's what I thought.

23:42.128 --> 23:43.338
[sighs]

23:48.134 --> 23:50.596
[reporter] Live on the scene here
at Litchfield Prison.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.264
No new activity in the last few hours.
We are still awaiting any--

23:53.348 --> 23:54.516
[TV cuts off]

23:54.600 --> 23:57.060
-Hey, I was watching that!
-And I was turning it off.

23:57.143 --> 24:00.021
You better get your booty
to the bus stop.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.441
If the bus leaves without you,
you got a long walk.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.111
And I'm not writing
no late-excuse letters to the school.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.154
It's like you don't even care about her.

24:08.238 --> 24:11.950
-Who?
-See? Cindy. My sister?

24:12.033 --> 24:14.745
Your daughter.
She's in that jail that's going off,

24:14.828 --> 24:16.454
and you're pretending
she don't even exist.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.040
I care about her very much.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.001
-You're not worried?
-Honey...

24:22.002 --> 24:25.547
I didn't tell you before
because I didn't want you worrying,

24:25.631 --> 24:27.508
but Cindy's not in that place.

24:27.591 --> 24:31.052
She was transferred to another facility
a couple of months back.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.888
And I'm sorry for keeping it from you.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.180
She got transferred?

24:34.264 --> 24:37.392
Yeah, something about
behavior infractions. I don't know.

24:37.475 --> 24:41.897
Point is, she's all right
and you don't have to worry about her.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.149
Focus on school, okay?

24:46.359 --> 24:47.485
She got transferred?

24:51.406 --> 24:52.949
[stutters] Where did you get that?

24:53.033 --> 24:55.160
It doesn't matter. You're a fucking liar.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.246
You watch your language!

24:58.329 --> 25:02.292
-Why should I listen to anything you say?
-Because I am your... your mother!

25:02.375 --> 25:07.130
-I wish you weren't.
-Well, sometimes I wish that, too.

25:07.213 --> 25:09.424
-[Frieda] Found the pliers.
-Wonderful.

25:10.551 --> 25:14.721
-You're actually going to torture him?
-Nothing he hasn't done to us.

25:14.805 --> 25:18.266
Yeah, but he's a monster.
You're... Red.

25:18.349 --> 25:20.185
[Big Boo] You know what, kids?

25:20.268 --> 25:23.313
I believe I've had, uh,
quite enough fun for a while.

25:23.396 --> 25:26.733
And blood?
It's not really my thing, so...

25:28.443 --> 25:29.444
Boo out.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.198
[Red] This man is no better than we are,

25:33.949 --> 25:37.869
and yet he gets to roam free
and make our lives a living hell?

25:37.953 --> 25:41.372
Because the system that condemns us
protects him?

25:41.456 --> 25:44.209
This is insane.
I need to go check on Alex.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.628
All right, Piper, come on.
We can't just leave her down here alone.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.215
[Red] Oh, yes, you can.
Leave me here. Go, all of you.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.551
I'm a big girl
and I don't need your moral elitism.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.928
-Oh! Oh! [grunts] Oh!
-Oh, oh, okay.

25:55.011 --> 25:59.515
Okay. Oh, boy, that really undercut
your whole independent lady thing, huh?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.892
-Norma, you bitch!
-[laughs]

26:00.976 --> 26:03.103
Impressive. Girl scout?

26:04.104 --> 26:07.148
All right, uh,
give me a hand over here, right?

26:07.232 --> 26:10.110
I wish that we could go back to the us
from two days ago

26:10.193 --> 26:12.362
and let them know that
this is where we were gonna be.

26:12.445 --> 26:16.825
-Blanca, you'll carry the torch, yes?
-Actually, Red, I'm pretty tired.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.952
All right, let's pretend
we're at a Jewish wedding, right?

26:19.035 --> 26:20.120
One, two, three!

26:20.203 --> 26:21.496
[all grunting]

26:22.080 --> 26:23.749
I hate all of you.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.251
Aw, we hate you back, Red, but with love!

26:27.502 --> 26:29.671
-[indistinct chatter]
-[groans]

26:30.714 --> 26:32.382
-Hey!
-You came back! [sniffles]

26:32.465 --> 26:33.466
[Big Boo] Oh!

26:34.092 --> 26:37.804
I should get kidnapped and held hostage
by a psychopath more often.

26:39.222 --> 26:42.058
I've had a lot of guys make a lot of
excuses for disappearing on me,

26:42.142 --> 26:44.602
but that by far is the most ridiculous one
I've ever heard.

26:44.686 --> 26:47.522
[chuckles] Okay. I'll work on it.

26:47.605 --> 26:51.276
Hey, girl, what happened to your face?

26:51.359 --> 26:53.737
-Your friend, the feral one?
-Ah.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.530
She's mad at me.
She thinks I stole you or something.

26:55.613 --> 26:57.615
[chuckles] Is that what's going on here,
Miss Von Barlow?

26:57.699 --> 26:59.284
Are you trying to steal me away?

27:00.076 --> 27:03.163
-What happened to your suit?
-Oh. Yeah.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.874
Victim of the riot. [sighs]

27:07.083 --> 27:08.835
I really liked that suit.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.504
Yeah, well,
you should see me in suspenders.

27:11.587 --> 27:12.714
Mmm.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.633
Come here. [grunts]

27:16.634 --> 27:18.386
-[sniffs] Oh!
-What?

27:18.469 --> 27:20.513
How can I put this politely?

27:21.514 --> 27:24.810
Have you been rolling around in
a pile of horse shit since I've been away?

27:24.893 --> 27:30.065
I had to hide in the Poo
to escape a Mexican mongoloid!

27:30.148 --> 27:33.318
Wow, I don't even know
which part of that is the most offensive.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.903
-[sighs]
-Impressive.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.321
[softly] Oh, God.

27:37.530 --> 27:40.075
How about I get you a nice hot shower?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.619
Oh, my God, that would be so nice.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.788
Well, I happen to know a place.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.707
-[indistinct chatter]
-Hello?

27:47.582 --> 27:50.961
Hello? I need Suzanne Warren's medication.
All of 'em.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.254
Oh, she doesn't take those anymore.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.631
[grunts] Pardon?

27:56.341 --> 27:59.469
Yeah. As a pretend
licensed medical professional,

27:59.552 --> 28:02.138
I made an uneducated
but still very thoughtful decision,

28:02.222 --> 28:04.515
-and I took her off those.
-The fuck?

28:04.599 --> 28:06.434
She's sick.
She needs her medication.

28:06.517 --> 28:08.937
No. No, no, no! No.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.107
That is the problem around here.
You are the problem.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.734
Okay, she is not sick.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.277
She is wonderful and beautiful and unique

28:16.361 --> 28:19.489
and just because her brain doesn't think
like everybody else's around here,

28:19.572 --> 28:21.867
doesn't mean
we should stuff her full of pills.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.327
-Do you know why we do that to people?
-Hmm?

28:24.410 --> 28:26.287
So we can feel more comfortable,

28:26.371 --> 28:30.458
so we don't have to deal with anyone
who isn't what we think they should be.

28:30.541 --> 28:33.003
I mean, who...
who's to say what normal is, anyway?

28:33.086 --> 28:34.921
Look, Professor Fakey Pants,

28:35.005 --> 28:37.924
I don't know what normal is,
but I know it ain't you.

28:38.008 --> 28:41.469
And because you took these
medical decisions into your own hands,

28:41.552 --> 28:44.680
Suzanne is freaking the fuck out
and we can't get her to calm down.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.474
So, now, I'm gonna need the medication.

28:46.557 --> 28:47.934
What's she take?

28:48.018 --> 28:50.896
No, that is confidential
patient information!

28:50.979 --> 28:54.900
Whoo! You are runnin' hard
on the psycho path,

28:54.983 --> 28:56.860
but maybe it's time to take a water break.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.362
No! No, no, no, no, no!
No, you can't touch those.

28:59.445 --> 29:00.864
What are you doing?
Put those down!

29:00.947 --> 29:02.532
-You can't take that!
-Look...

29:03.449 --> 29:06.369
sometimes the greater good matters more
than one raving lunatic.

29:06.452 --> 29:10.623
Now her crazy is puttin' us all at risk
and scarin' the fuck out of me personally.

29:10.706 --> 29:17.463
Uh-uh! Get... the fuck...
out of my way!

29:18.799 --> 29:20.175
[whimpers]

29:20.258 --> 29:26.264
Spread the word. This bathroom is
off-limits for at least an hour.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.099
[chuckling] Yeah.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.729
[mellow music playing over speakers]

29:34.730 --> 29:35.857
[Linda] Mmm.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.651
You know, if I close my eyes,

29:38.734 --> 29:41.529
this is exactly like
the Serenity Day Spa in Utica.

29:41.612 --> 29:43.865
Except for the faint notes
of shit and piss in the air.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.910
Utica?
I thought you were from Connecticut.

29:50.330 --> 29:53.666
You know, it is a little known fact
about Connecticut

29:53.749 --> 29:56.211
-that we actually also have a Utica.
-Mmm.

29:57.003 --> 29:58.129
Yeah, it's near New Haven.

29:58.213 --> 30:03.426
Well, now, aren't you just a little bundle
of Connecticut trivia? [chuckles]

30:03.509 --> 30:05.720
-I kill at trivia night.
-[chuckling]

30:05.804 --> 30:06.930
In Connecticut.

30:07.013 --> 30:10.308
Specifically in Connecticut.
[chuckles] Mmm.

30:13.061 --> 30:16.982
Fuck, would you look at me?
I'm all giggly and gay for you.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.774
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you're gay all the time.

30:18.859 --> 30:19.775
Correct.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.488
-I'm just not typically "gay" gay.
-[sighs]

30:23.571 --> 30:27.450
Aw, are you gonna pass me a note
and ask me if I like you now?

30:27.533 --> 30:30.161
God. I love it when you're a bitch.

30:31.121 --> 30:33.539
It's just so... me.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.750
Mmm. That's what relationships are, right?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.211
-Hmm?
-Well, it's just finding someone who...

30:38.294 --> 30:39.880
[inhales deeply]

30:39.963 --> 30:42.798
reflects those parts of yourself
that you want everyone else to see.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.969
It's narcissism,
but in a prettier package.

30:46.052 --> 30:51.141
Well, then I guess I want everyone to see
that I'm a hot piece of ass

30:51.224 --> 30:56.687
with a big set of brass balls
and a mouth to back them up.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.523
I've never felt so seen.

31:08.574 --> 31:09.575
[Big Boo chuckles]

31:10.451 --> 31:12.287
-Fresh towel?
-That sounds lovely.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.705
[chuckles] Great. Be right back.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.460
A prize!

31:21.837 --> 31:22.964
[Linda] Hmm?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.221
What'd you find, babe?

31:31.181 --> 31:32.390
Oh...

31:33.516 --> 31:35.851
that mildew stain on the wall, it's, uh...

31:37.145 --> 31:39.230
Looks like a set of tits, doesn't it?

31:41.107 --> 31:42.192
Hmm.

31:43.859 --> 31:46.029
Yeah, I can totally kind of see that.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.868
[inhales deeply and grunts]

31:52.953 --> 31:55.371
[breathing deeply]

31:56.581 --> 31:58.833
Looks like I missed out on all the fun.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.711
[sniffles] Guess you're real committed
to your team, huh?

32:01.794 --> 32:05.090
[sniffles] All it took was a little rain
to get your ass back in here.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.635
What the fuck happened to all the guards?

32:09.719 --> 32:11.930
Gloria been kicking their asses!

32:12.013 --> 32:14.265
She been sending them shitheads
to the Poo all day.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.766
It's been mad entertaining. [chuckles]

32:15.850 --> 32:18.061
[Ouija] Yeah, she's like Scarface
or some shit.

32:18.144 --> 32:21.106
Nah, she's like that dude
in the karate movie,

32:21.189 --> 32:23.733
the one with the kid!
What's it called?

32:23.816 --> 32:25.610
-Karate Kid.
-Right.

32:25.693 --> 32:29.948
'Cause we like the old dude
who's been teaching her. [chuckles]

32:30.031 --> 32:33.994
[inhales deeply] Hey,
why do you guys care about this thing?

32:34.619 --> 32:37.538
The real question is, why don't you?

32:40.291 --> 32:43.003
You know this means
we're in here forever now, right?

32:44.879 --> 32:46.714
We're never getting out after this.

32:48.466 --> 32:52.928
[scoffs] Yo, this is our time, man.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.597
These days is all we got.

32:55.265 --> 32:58.018
Rest of our lives,
people gonna treat us like garbage.

32:58.101 --> 33:02.813
But right now, people are listening.
Right now, people care.

33:03.814 --> 33:07.818
You wanna miss out your chance
to change some shit around here?

33:07.902 --> 33:11.906
You wanna sit out the one time
that you got real power?

33:13.241 --> 33:16.036
Take some fucking responsibility,
so when all this is over,

33:16.119 --> 33:19.789
you can say that you stood up
and did something.

33:19.872 --> 33:22.250
Be a fucking role model
to your kids and shit.

33:25.670 --> 33:26.962
[chuckles and sniffles]

33:28.089 --> 33:31.967
Or at least don't get your ass kicked
by the rest of us. [chuckles]

33:32.052 --> 33:33.178
[sniffles]

33:33.261 --> 33:36.597
Hey, guys! It's Flaritza
with your favorite beauty tips!

33:36.681 --> 33:40.143
Ladies, hair is your most valuable tool.

33:40.226 --> 33:41.477
Got a lazy eye?

33:43.896 --> 33:48.609
Just like that, boys will think
you're mysterious instead of cross-eyed!

33:49.569 --> 33:51.529
Forehead looking like a sixhead?

33:53.364 --> 33:55.408
-Voilà!
-[clattering]

33:55.491 --> 34:00.621
[Ouija] You sit the fuck down
before I rip your eyeballs out one by one!

34:00.705 --> 34:01.706
Got it?

34:06.586 --> 34:07.712
[Miguel softly] Mom.

34:12.132 --> 34:17.679
[Ouija] You sit the fuck down
before I rip your eyeballs out one by one!

34:17.763 --> 34:18.764
Got it?

34:18.848 --> 34:21.184
Yo, hostility is not a good look.

34:21.266 --> 34:24.228
Sorry, guys.
We'll be back soon with a chiller vibe.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.940
Will someone untie me already?

34:29.024 --> 34:30.900
[Piper] Are you gonna run back down there?

34:31.902 --> 34:33.529
-Yes.
-Then no.

34:33.612 --> 34:36.116
You can't stop me from taking him down.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.743
Maybe instead of continuing to obsess
over this whole revenge thing,

34:38.826 --> 34:40.245
you could, I don't know,

34:40.328 --> 34:45.250
uh, look around at the consequences
of your drug-fueled actions and apologize.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.333
For what?

34:46.417 --> 34:49.254
So we're still in the denial phase. Noted.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.714
This is sort of all your fault, Red.

34:51.797 --> 34:54.425
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Nothing is ever one person's fault.

34:54.509 --> 34:58.012
You and your heavy-browed minion
over there lured him in here.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.391
I got them shaped. I look more like
Brooke Shields than Frida Kahlo now.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.933
I don't know
who the fuck Brooke Shields is,

35:03.017 --> 35:04.059
but that's what Flaritza said.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.146
Look, we were trying to help all of you.

35:06.229 --> 35:09.149
By inviting a bloodthirsty,
armed maniac into the prison?

35:09.232 --> 35:11.109
By making his crimes public

35:11.192 --> 35:13.778
and ensuring that
he never works here again.

35:13.861 --> 35:18.366
None of this sounds insane to you
now that you're off the drugs?

35:18.449 --> 35:21.035
I didn't know they were drugs.
She lied to me!

35:21.119 --> 35:23.829
-Please, you lied to yourself.
-She ain't wrong.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.374
We were just sitting here,
minding our own business...

35:26.457 --> 35:28.459
Selfishly hoarding all of these supplies.

35:28.543 --> 35:32.547
It's not our fault
we're enjoyable company...

35:32.630 --> 35:34.174
and Frieda invited us.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.467
There's also that part
where the two of you made us look like

35:36.551 --> 35:39.137
radical Islamic terrorists on the news.
Remember that?

35:39.220 --> 35:42.140
Uh-uh. I went back downstairs.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.975
I think that we're starting
to split hairs here a little bit.

35:45.059 --> 35:48.688
Don't even start with us,
you Cheeto stealer!

35:48.771 --> 35:50.315
-[chuckles]
-Don't you laugh at me.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.401
What? You were all "ra-ra riot"
for a while there.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.860
Piper "Pussy Riot" Chapman.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.530
You know, at least
she was doing something, huh?

35:57.613 --> 35:59.949
That's right.
At least I was doing something.

36:00.032 --> 36:02.160
Where were you when your mother
was popping her little helpers?

36:02.243 --> 36:04.370
Hey, look, lady,
some of us were trying to stay out of it

36:04.454 --> 36:06.581
while others of us
were cutting the electricity

36:06.664 --> 36:08.541
to the entire fucking prison!

36:08.624 --> 36:11.502
But who can really say what's worse,
am I right?

36:11.586 --> 36:13.213
I was trying to help!

36:13.296 --> 36:16.131
Don't intentions count for anything?
And it's back, right?

36:16.216 --> 36:17.758
[all arguing]

36:17.842 --> 36:19.844
...she was saying intentions
count for something.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.305
We were trying to bring Piscatella
over here!

36:22.388 --> 36:23.806
[arguing continues]

36:48.038 --> 36:52.084
-Oh, shit. You put them in together?
-Ain't got room otherwise.

36:52.167 --> 36:55.671
[laughs] You are fire, yo.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.757
-[cell phone vibrating]
-Oh, you see that?

36:59.133 --> 37:00.635
Yeah, I'll be right back.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.390
[Ouija and Pidge speaking indistinctly]

37:07.099 --> 37:08.434
[breathes heavily]

37:08.518 --> 37:10.019
-Lourdes?
-[Lourdes] Gloria.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.562
[in Spanish] They're taking him
into surgery.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.148
If you want to talk to him first,
I thought...

37:14.232 --> 37:15.691
maybe he can hear you.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.235
[Gloria] Yes, yes, eh...

37:18.278 --> 37:21.071
-You'll hold the phone to him?
-Yes. Go ahead.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.826
[in English] Baby?

37:28.954 --> 37:30.831
Hi, baby. [chuckles]

37:32.792 --> 37:36.879
I know you don't like it when
I call you that, but you're still my baby.

37:36.962 --> 37:40.132
And everything's gonna be okay,
you hear me? It's gonna be all right.

37:40.215 --> 37:42.176
The doctors,
they're gonna take care of you,

37:42.260 --> 37:43.928
and I'mma be there real soon.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.722
I'mma be there when you wake up.

37:46.806 --> 37:50.935
I got a plan... and I'mma be
right next to you before you know it.

37:51.018 --> 37:54.146
[sighs] Mama's coming for you.

37:54.229 --> 37:58.276
Until I get there, I need you to...
I need you to fight.

37:58.984 --> 38:01.946
You put up those fists and you fight.

38:04.615 --> 38:07.952
I ain't never gonna tell you that again
after this, but today... today...

38:08.035 --> 38:11.372
Today, you fight. You fight like hell!

38:13.583 --> 38:14.750
[breathes shakily]

38:17.920 --> 38:20.172
I love you.
I love you, Benjamin Mendoza.

38:20.255 --> 38:23.551
I love you so much.
I love you more than my life.

38:23.634 --> 38:27.805
I would trade places with you.
I would trade places with you if I could.

38:28.764 --> 38:30.558
[crying] I love you.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.438
[in Spanish] You there?
I'm sorry, did I cut you off?

38:35.521 --> 38:37.940
No, no. It's fine.

38:38.023 --> 38:41.736
They're here to take him down.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.071
Lourdes. Thank you.

38:49.284 --> 38:50.578
[in English] You okay?

38:54.289 --> 38:55.583
[exhales deeply] Yeah.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.252
Yeah, I'm all right.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.212
-You sure?
-[breathing shakily]

39:03.466 --> 39:06.469
-My kid is in the hospital.
-[gasps]

39:06.552 --> 39:07.678
Fuck.

39:09.138 --> 39:12.933
-Sorry.
-[breath trembling] Yeah.

39:14.394 --> 39:18.731
It's ironic, you know?
I'm this fucking criminal...

39:19.774 --> 39:25.070
but I never thought about killing anyone
until I had Pepa.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.864
And then suddenly...

39:28.491 --> 39:31.577
there was this tiny little girl
that I made.

39:32.495 --> 39:36.541
And when I looked at her...
when I saw her little feet,

39:37.792 --> 39:40.503
I knew I would do anything for her.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.798
I would murder someone if I had to.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.514
Releasing the hostages
so you could see your son,

39:51.597 --> 39:54.099
is that worse
or better than killing somebody?

39:54.183 --> 39:55.768
What the hell are you talking about?

39:57.186 --> 39:58.187
I made a deal.

39:58.270 --> 40:00.355
Head of MCC say he will give me furlough

40:00.440 --> 40:02.817
if I released the hostages
and ended all of this.

40:02.900 --> 40:03.901
Are you serious?

40:03.984 --> 40:06.862
-How the fuck--
-I'mma take 'em to the Poo...

40:06.946 --> 40:11.366
I'mma cut a hole in that fence
and I'mma run. I'mma run like hell.

40:11.451 --> 40:12.535
You're running with them?

40:12.618 --> 40:15.663
-Yeah, yeah. That's the plan.
-Shit.

40:16.288 --> 40:18.833
-You a brave motherfucker.
-[sobs]

40:18.916 --> 40:20.084
[exhales deeply]

40:20.167 --> 40:23.003
Bitches in here would lynch me,
not call me brave.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.715
Look, I don't give a shit
about this thing, all right?

40:25.798 --> 40:27.925
So if you ask me, you brave.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.470
You fuckin' brave.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.140
You do what you gotta do, you know?

40:36.601 --> 40:39.353
You don't owe nothing to no one in here.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.818
-Really?
-You ain't doing nothing

40:45.901 --> 40:49.154
every woman in here wouldn't do
if she had the chance, so...

40:56.245 --> 40:57.747
Hope it works.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.415
Ah.

41:07.172 --> 41:10.134
What are you doing? She loves those.

41:10.217 --> 41:11.969
She don't need all that sugar, Ma.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.764
Ay. [sighs]
You're too strict with her.

41:14.847 --> 41:16.140
You let me have that crap
when I was little?

41:16.223 --> 41:20.269
No. But it's different.
She's my grandbaby.

41:21.186 --> 41:22.563
No.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.525
Aw! Look how cute!

41:25.608 --> 41:28.027
-[cooing]
-[Carolina chuckles] Hello!

41:28.110 --> 41:30.863
-Hi. Hi, hello.
-[cooing]

41:30.946 --> 41:32.197
Hello.

41:33.949 --> 41:35.743
She's beautiful.

41:35.826 --> 41:37.203
-Is she yours?
-Yeah.

41:37.703 --> 41:39.246
[Carolina] What's her name?

41:39.329 --> 41:41.456
-[Yadriel] Pepa.
-Pepa.

41:41.541 --> 41:45.460
Hi, Pepa.
Your father's very handsome.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.838
-Aren't you a lucky little girl?
-[giggles]

41:48.589 --> 41:49.924
[sing-song] He's single.

41:52.467 --> 41:54.053
Have a nice day.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.555
Oh.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.557
Yeah. You, too.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.849
[Pepa cooing]

42:02.937 --> 42:04.104
Why do you always do that?

42:04.188 --> 42:06.481
-Do what?
-Ignore girls.

42:07.399 --> 42:09.694
-I don't need no girl, Ma.
-You do.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.946
And don't think I don't know
what you're doing, huh?

42:12.530 --> 42:15.324
Waiting around for Maria.
Hoping she's coming back.

42:15.407 --> 42:18.619
Nothing's too good for my son.
Only jailbait criminals for him.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.413
Don't call her that again.

42:24.709 --> 42:25.710
[Linda] Do you mind?

42:27.502 --> 42:29.046
But of course.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.843
[Big Boo clears throat]

42:38.097 --> 42:39.348
Oh, God.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.561
I wonder when this insanity is gonna end.

42:43.644 --> 42:46.355
Why? Do you have some important
prison business to get back to?

42:46.438 --> 42:48.941
[chuckles] No.

42:49.942 --> 42:54.446
But, uh, it's gotta end sometime, right?
This can't go on forever.

42:54.529 --> 42:58.576
Yeah, well, Attica lasted, what?
Four days?

42:58.659 --> 43:03.623
I say they'll come in here and kill us all
if we don't surrender within 24 hours.

43:03.706 --> 43:05.290
There are innocent people in here.

43:05.374 --> 43:07.793
I mean, I don't even belong...
I mean, there are...

43:07.877 --> 43:10.838
There are people in here
that didn't do anything, you know.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.715
-[hair rips]
-Ow!

43:12.798 --> 43:17.845
Oh, I'm sorry... sweetheart.

43:17.928 --> 43:21.015
That's okay. Just... be gentle.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.059
Oh, I'll be gentle.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.605
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.565
-Weird?
-Yeah.

43:30.650 --> 43:35.905
Hmm. That's strange.
I wonder how that could be.

43:36.530 --> 43:40.910
[chuckles] I mean,
it's not like I've been lied to, led on,

43:40.993 --> 43:43.287
or happen to be sleeping with the enemy.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.499
Please.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.794
That is not...

43:49.877 --> 43:51.671
-I... I didn't...
-Didn't what?

43:51.754 --> 43:54.674
Sneak in here undercover for the outside,
you fucking mole! [stomps foot]

43:54.757 --> 43:56.050
No, I really didn't do that.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.969
And the only thing you haven't lied about
is being a cunt.

43:59.053 --> 44:00.470
-Please. This is a huge misunderstanding.
-Really?

44:00.554 --> 44:03.473
'Cause I'm pretty clear about
Caputo's dick in your mouth.

44:03.557 --> 44:06.185
No, I... have a narrow jaw.
That's... not the point.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.145
Please, just... Okay.

44:09.313 --> 44:12.357
If you just listen to me,
I promise you, I promise you,

44:12.441 --> 44:15.027
-I will tell you the truth, okay?
-[inhales deeply]

44:15.110 --> 44:16.737
Okay, it's...

44:16.821 --> 44:18.613
[all arguing]

44:21.033 --> 44:22.993
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

44:23.077 --> 44:25.245
[Gina] Jesus, come on!
What is wrong with you?

44:25.329 --> 44:26.706
That's enough!

44:27.456 --> 44:28.582
[sighs]

44:29.208 --> 44:30.793
Look at yourselves.

44:31.669 --> 44:35.630
Fighting. Yelling.
And breaking my shit.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.218
Sorry about the chess board, Frieda.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.136
[Nicky sighs]

44:41.220 --> 44:43.889
We're supposed to be the good guys.

44:43.973 --> 44:45.265
-How did we get here?
-Speed.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.351
-Pot.
-Power does weird things to people.

44:47.434 --> 44:51.438
You know, I... I think not sleeping
or eating while also being,

44:51.521 --> 44:54.608
you know, kidnapped and tortured
might have just something to do with it.

44:54.691 --> 44:56.443
Also, we're in the middle
of overthrowing a prison.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.905
Still not completely clear
on the trajectory of that one.

45:00.405 --> 45:02.742
-Thank you, Norma.
-Okay. Now what?

45:02.825 --> 45:05.410
[Frieda] We need to establish
a rationing system.

45:05.994 --> 45:09.665
And try to hold on to our dignity.

45:11.333 --> 45:15.337
Does someone want the other half
of this because, uh, if not, you know...

45:15.420 --> 45:18.298
If we're not gonna torture Piscatella,
what the hell are we gonna do with him?

45:18.382 --> 45:21.676
[Frieda] We're gonna keep him tied up
until this thing is over...

45:22.386 --> 45:24.847
and then we'll hand him over.

45:27.016 --> 45:29.894
I can't believe
that man is going to walk free.

45:29.977 --> 45:31.520
Uh... would this help?

45:31.603 --> 45:33.355
[Piper through speaker] No! Stop it!

45:33.438 --> 45:35.565
[Piscatella] Oh, I've had enough
of this insubordination.

45:35.649 --> 45:37.192
-[inmates exclaiming]
-You are federal inmates...

45:37.276 --> 45:40.695
Holy shit!
Gina, you magical nymph!

45:40.780 --> 45:42.072
-[kisses]
-I stand corrected.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.366
This totally makes up
for the electricity thing.

45:44.449 --> 45:45.826
Fuckin' A!

45:45.910 --> 45:48.829
[Piper on speaker] ...to you exactly
what you are doing to us right now!

45:48.913 --> 45:50.747
You both look great in those curtains.

45:51.331 --> 45:52.541
[gasps]

46:03.427 --> 46:04.636
Uh...

46:07.264 --> 46:08.265
[grunts]

46:11.643 --> 46:13.145
[stammers]

46:15.730 --> 46:17.232
[chuckling]

46:21.153 --> 46:22.947
[gasping]

46:24.198 --> 46:25.740
[Alison and Janae exclaiming]

46:25.825 --> 46:27.910
[Janae] Please get down. Just stop it.

46:27.993 --> 46:31.038
That's... that's...
that's not how it works!

46:31.121 --> 46:32.372
[groans]

46:32.456 --> 46:34.749
I think we gotta be firmer with her.

46:34.834 --> 46:36.210
-[grunting]
-[Janae yelling]

46:36.293 --> 46:39.463
Yo! Stop! Yo! Yo!
You better get your ass down here

46:39.546 --> 46:41.966
before the rest of these bitches
throw it down for you!

46:42.049 --> 46:45.052
-What the hell is happening?
-[grunting and yelling]

46:45.135 --> 46:47.596
-She's trying to find heaven.
-Say what now?

46:47.679 --> 46:49.306
[grunting]

46:49.389 --> 46:52.101
It's like she's hallucinating
or something.

46:52.184 --> 46:53.185
[sighs]

46:53.268 --> 46:56.230
-Man, where's Taystee?
-[exclaims] I got this.

46:56.313 --> 46:57.940
I don't wanna be here anymore!

46:58.023 --> 47:00.025
-I hate this place!
-[coughing]

47:00.109 --> 47:01.276
I wanna go to the better place.

47:01.360 --> 47:06.156
Please, let me in! Let me in!

47:06.240 --> 47:08.868

I'm good! Please! I'm good.

47:13.288 --> 47:15.582
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good,

47:15.665 --> 47:17.001
-I'm good, I'm good.

47:17.084 --> 47:18.793
-Suzanne!
-[gasping]

47:18.878 --> 47:19.920
It's time for your medicine.

47:20.004 --> 47:23.548
-I don't take medicine now.
-Yes, you do.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.262
You know your schedule, right?

47:28.345 --> 47:31.556
Pill line, 10:00 and 4:00.
10:00 and 4:00.

47:31.640 --> 47:35.852
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. That's right.
And guess what time it is right now?

47:36.937 --> 47:38.939
[whimpering]

47:41.775 --> 47:44.236
-10:00?
-Mmm-hmm.

47:45.195 --> 47:47.114
So get your butt down here
and take your meds

47:47.197 --> 47:48.991
before the COs gives you a shot.

47:49.074 --> 47:50.284
[Janae] Uh-huh.

47:54.413 --> 47:55.789
[grunts]

47:55.872 --> 47:59.418
-Listen, what the hell are you doing?
-I'm getting her calmed down.

47:59.501 --> 48:01.962
-With what, exactly?
-Uh, lithium.

48:02.046 --> 48:04.798
Look, I read somewhere
it's good for... for crazy.

48:04.881 --> 48:07.759
Are you kidding me?
You don't even know what it does.

48:07.842 --> 48:08.885
[Suzanne] And I'm not a bad person.

48:08.969 --> 48:11.138
I'm guessin' she'll sleep
for a little while, so what?

48:11.221 --> 48:12.389
[Suzanne] I am good. I am good.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.349
She damn near ruined
negotiations last night.

48:14.433 --> 48:15.600
You want her to keep that shit up?

48:15.684 --> 48:17.477
[Suzanne] Everything's going to be okay.

48:17.561 --> 48:18.895
Shh! Yeah.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.897
This is fucked up, man.

48:22.232 --> 48:24.359

48:24.443 --> 48:26.861
-Shh!
-Tell me I ain't handling shit.

48:26.946 --> 48:29.739
[whimpers] Shh!

48:29.823 --> 48:32.951
-Shh!
-Hey. Hey. Here you go.

48:37.622 --> 48:40.667
[crying] Will these make me good?

48:53.138 --> 48:54.223
Yes.

48:59.561 --> 49:00.980
[breathing shakily]

49:13.742 --> 49:14.868
Good.

49:15.494 --> 49:16.495
[coughs]

49:17.662 --> 49:18.788
You wanna lie down?

49:20.082 --> 49:21.125
Take a little nap?

49:28.382 --> 49:29.633
Watch yourself.

49:30.884 --> 49:31.926
Okay.

49:32.802 --> 49:34.471

-Hey. Come on.

49:34.554 --> 49:36.640
-Okay.

49:37.349 --> 49:40.269
You know, my baby sister used to ask me
to sing to her.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.396
You want me to sing?

49:42.479 --> 49:44.856
Do you know
"Take Me Out To The Ball Game"?

49:46.150 --> 49:47.401
The baseball song?

49:48.277 --> 49:50.529
My dad used to sing it to me.

49:51.530 --> 49:54.241
And I like that part about the home team.
