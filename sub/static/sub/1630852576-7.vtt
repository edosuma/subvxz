00:01.335 --> 00:03.371
Harper:
<i>Previously on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.073
<i>Campfire is almost over.</i>

00:05.206 --> 00:07.508
Whatever's gonna happen,
it's gonna be soon.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.510
Zoey:
<i>Today is the anniversary</i>
<i>of Savannah's death.</i>

00:09.643 --> 00:11.579
<i>This is our best chance</i>
<i>to get proof she's real.</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:14.115
Savannah, we summon you.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.484
Please, show yourself.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.718
(can rattling)

00:17.851 --> 00:19.487
(both screaming)

00:19.620 --> 00:22.823
Whoa, whoa, wait.
We did it. We made contact.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.292
Jess:
<i>I told you to make sure</i>

00:24.425 --> 00:25.759
<i>that your sister</i>
<i>didn't leave the house.</i>

00:25.893 --> 00:26.660
(door opens)

00:26.794 --> 00:28.062
(snoring sounds)

00:28.696 --> 00:29.563
Is she at the Tremont?

00:29.697 --> 00:31.031
Harper:
<i>We shouldn't have left.</i>

00:31.165 --> 00:33.167
Griffin:
<i>We didn't have a choice.</i>
<i>They were about to catch us.</i>

00:33.301 --> 00:35.336
Savannah wasn't found missing
until the morning.
It's still night.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.271
Harper:
<i>We have to go back.</i>
<i>We can still save her.</i>

00:38.206 --> 00:39.707
Griffin:
The portal didn't work.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.742
We failed.
Savannah's gone forever.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.910
What are you two
doing out here?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.912
And don't even think
about lying.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.616
I dare you!
Spend the rest of the night
in the basement...

00:48.749 --> 00:50.118
with the ghost.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.253
Savannah:
<i>I can do that dare,</i>
<i>no sweat.</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:54.155
You don't have to prove
anything to Jess.

00:58.159 --> 00:58.992
Hello?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.170
Wyatt:
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.571
They said to stay
in our rooms.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.141
No way.
I'm not missing this
for anything.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.344
-I don't know, maybe--
-Shh.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.079
They're in the parlor.
Come on.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.883
(muffled voices)

01:23.016 --> 01:25.419
Jess: ...your brother
to cover for you?
What were you thinking?

01:25.553 --> 01:28.122
Ben: I just want to know
what were you doing out there
in the middle of the night.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.390
It's a simple question, Griff.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.160
Jess:
I'm not taking you home

01:32.293 --> 01:33.427
until you tell us
where you've been.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.564
We're okay. We're safe.
We're home.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.832
-Isn't that enough?
-Not nearly.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.568
Ben:
According to what Topher
and the twins told us,

01:40.701 --> 01:43.471
you were gone a long time.
Half the night.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.374
Harper,
you haven't said a word.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.179
-Harper?
-It's embarrassing, okay?

01:52.213 --> 01:54.348
We wanted
some private time.

01:55.849 --> 01:56.984
Private time?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.420
I think we need
a little more
of an explanation.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.690
You guys
didn't want us
to see each other,

02:02.823 --> 02:06.227
so we came up
with a plan...
to sneak off.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.496
And do what, exactly?

02:09.096 --> 02:11.064
E-- Exactly? Well--

02:11.199 --> 02:13.133
We just wanted
to be alone to--

02:13.267 --> 02:14.802
Play cards
and talk--

02:14.935 --> 02:16.637
And have
our first kiss.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.041
Said it was embarrassing.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.680
Can I go to bed now?

02:26.814 --> 02:28.816
We'll start with grounded
for a very long time.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.354
No bike, no woods,
no... anything.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.088
Jess:
Same for you, Harper.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.525
And Topher,
for aiding and abetting.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.260
Ditto the twins.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.395
Thank you, Sarah, Ben.

02:42.696 --> 02:46.267
In the very near future,
Harper will be
writing you an apology.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.901
Ben:
As will Griffin.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.538
No need to see us out.
Good night, everyone.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.506
Harper?

02:57.144 --> 02:58.279
Ben:
Anything else
you want to add?

02:59.347 --> 03:01.181
I want to hear
more about that kiss!

03:01.315 --> 03:02.383
-(door closes)
-I don't.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.885
You two,
back to bed.
Now!

03:05.753 --> 03:07.120
Griffin, go with them.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.889
We'll talk more about this
in the morning.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.192
Go!

03:15.429 --> 03:16.930
Do you believe
anything they said?

03:18.098 --> 03:19.032
Not a word of it.

03:21.569 --> 03:24.505
(theme music playing)

03:50.264 --> 03:51.899
Yuck!
Another goner.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.835
I've always said
we needed a generator.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.870
This power outage
has wiped out
our inventory.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.507
Go! Get it out of here.
You know where.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.178
Okay. I'll do it.
No problem.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.914
You just sit there
staring into space.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.032
Long night.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.906
So, you and Griffin...

04:33.941 --> 04:35.008
Big romance, huh?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.077
I wouldn't go that far.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.082
Look, Harper...

04:43.484 --> 04:45.152
I know you're still
keeping things from me.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.688
And I think,
when you do that,

04:47.821 --> 04:49.222
it's not always
the healthiest thing.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.859
You do
the same thing, Mom.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.461
I see the way
you look at Griffin's dad.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.329
It's almost...

04:55.996 --> 04:57.431
like you two have a secret.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.601
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.636
You don't? Really?

05:03.604 --> 05:04.505
Yes, really.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.976
I don't understand
how you can expect me
to be honest, when you're not.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.752
Okay, you're right.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.223
I did go to camp
with Griffin's dad.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.861
And I was there the night
Savannah went missing.

05:31.031 --> 05:31.932
It was...

05:33.734 --> 05:35.335
a terrible experience.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.072
Which is why
I didn't talk about it.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.342
I hope
you can understand that.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.346
I do.
I do understand that.

05:50.250 --> 05:54.021
You're growing up so fast,
I sometimes forget that.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.726
-(machines whirring)
-Ah.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.528
We're in business!

06:01.228 --> 06:02.396
Ah!

06:02.530 --> 06:03.764
Oh, uh,
do me a favor.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.799
Go see what's taking
your brother so long.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.174
Mom's looking for you.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.843
All right, all right.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.412
Hold up.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.182
You've gotta be kidding.
Again?

06:22.315 --> 06:23.484
Look, I need your help.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.919
Oh, no. No way.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.155
I'm already grounded,
forced into hard labor--

06:28.288 --> 06:30.257
Ten minutes, Topher.
That's all I need.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.626
Please. Please.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.361
Please!

06:35.195 --> 06:36.930
Okay, 10 minutes.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.772
You're a good little brother.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.584
♪**♪

07:16.169 --> 07:17.705
Thank goodness, I don't have
to take a flashlight

07:17.838 --> 07:19.139
into the bathroom anymore.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.340
TMI.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.976
Mom, check it out.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.845
-Let there be light!
-Ah!

07:37.725 --> 07:39.459
Well, I got a surge here.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.094
-Check the other outlets.
-Got it.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.308
You won't believe it.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.877
My mother confessed!

07:57.010 --> 07:57.778
Wait, what?

07:57.911 --> 07:58.912
She admitted
she went to camp

07:59.046 --> 07:59.880
and knew Savannah.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.249
It seemed like
it was hard for her
to talk about.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.553
I feel like my dad was still
holding something back too,

08:05.686 --> 08:07.721
about what happened
to Savannah.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.524
All I got last night
was "the talk."

08:11.458 --> 08:13.326
Nice save, but
did we have to be kissing?

08:13.460 --> 08:15.896
Sorry, it was
the first thing
that came to my mind.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.831
Yeah?

08:17.965 --> 08:19.733
Well,
it certainly wasn't
the first on mine.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.204
They're going to miss me
in five seconds.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.305
I didn't set anything up.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.940
All I bought us
was 10 minutes,

08:27.074 --> 08:28.976
and that's now
officially run out.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.110
You ready?

08:34.014 --> 08:34.982
Let's do this.

08:37.651 --> 08:41.589
(banging on door)

08:43.456 --> 08:44.291
Is Harper here?

08:46.159 --> 08:47.460
Ben:
Of course not.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.996
Griffin's been with us
all morning.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.231
Last I saw,
he was checking plugs.
Griffin!

08:51.364 --> 08:53.000
Listen, I think that
they've run off together.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.670
Wait, uh,
we made it very clear.

08:56.804 --> 08:57.805
Kids, go look around.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.774
Zoey:
Griffin!

09:02.109 --> 09:05.078
Uh, I would think running off
would be the last thing
they'd do.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.179
Okay, I know that.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.081
But Harper has said things
to Topher.

09:08.215 --> 09:08.782
Tell them, honey.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.752
I saw her before she left.
She said, "Ten minutes."

09:11.885 --> 09:12.886
But it was more, like,

09:13.020 --> 09:14.622
"Goodbye, Topher,
I'm never coming back."

09:15.989 --> 09:17.591
Guys, she hugged me.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.792
That's just not normal.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.127
(footsteps approaching)

09:20.260 --> 09:22.596
Not down here.
We'll check upstairs.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.965
You too, Topher.
You can help.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.971
I think we need
to call the police.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.817
-Griffin: Ben.
-(knocks on door)

09:43.951 --> 09:45.719
Out here. Now.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.791
-Why all the sneaking around?
-Never mind that.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.761
We need to find out
what happened to Savannah
after the campfire.

09:53.894 --> 09:54.928
I don't-- I don't know.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.229
Isn't she at her bunkhouse?

09:56.363 --> 09:57.965
But you were with her
last night, right?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.332
Uh, we all were.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.469
Uh... where
is this coming from?

10:03.370 --> 10:04.672
(camp bell rings)

10:04.805 --> 10:07.474
Uh, meeting bell. Gotta go.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.385
No sign of them
on the property.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.488
-The old camp area?
-No. Nothing.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.657
-The treehouse?
-First place I looked.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.593
Her phone's off.
Griffin's too.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.896
-(Ben sighs)
-Obviously, they don't want
to be found.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.734
Of all days,
this day.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.605
Most of my life,
I have worked hard
to forget...

10:40.273 --> 10:41.474
what happened to Savannah.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.512
This can't be
a coincidence, Ben.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.483
You really think
this place is haunted
by Savannah?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.219
Come on.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.354
You're starting
to sound like the kids.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.891
All I know is
they shut the doors
to this place for a reason,

10:58.025 --> 11:00.227
and you're the one
that opened them up again.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.296
Yeah? Well,
I'll tell you this.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.300
No way will this day end
the way that one did.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.542
campers/counselors:
Savannah! Savannah!

11:21.882 --> 11:23.683
Griffin:
They're already looking
for Savannah.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.384
Harper:
If only it mattered.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.586
What if they
do find her this time?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.756
We know how
this plays out, Griffin.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.323
Same way it did
30 years ago.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.660
Thirty years ago,
we weren't here

11:33.794 --> 11:35.095
hanging out
with our parents.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.930
Now we are. That has
to change things somehow.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.966
It hasn't yet,
and we've tried.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.367
Your mom came clean
about going to camp.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.103
Would that have happened
before we found the portal?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.739
There was no reason for her
to tell me the truth.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.441
I wasn't sneaking around
or asking questions
about her past.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.176
Exactly!

11:50.410 --> 11:54.314
I guess us being here
could be shifting things,
slightly.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.217
Maybe all we need
is a small change
to save Savannah.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.586
When did you
become an optimist?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.521
(chuckles)
Guess you're
rubbing off on me.

12:01.654 --> 12:02.589
(scoffs)

12:05.225 --> 12:07.127
-Savannah!
-Savannah!

12:08.628 --> 12:10.263
Savannah,
are you out here?

12:10.397 --> 12:16.469
Savannah!

12:18.605 --> 12:20.607
♪**♪

12:25.879 --> 12:27.014
Ben:
They're searching
the lake?

12:27.815 --> 12:29.883
Why? Savannah's
a good swimmer.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.320
Maybe Moss Man
dumped her in there.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.189
Doubt it. Everyone knows
Moss Man would never--

12:36.323 --> 12:38.291
Enough with
the Moss Man talk.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.894
He didn't grab Savannah.
It's just a silly story.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.964
Savannah's probably
just playing another prank.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.133
She'll do anything
for attention.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.910
Why didn't you look
for Savannah last night?

12:57.644 --> 12:58.478
I didn't know
she was gone.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.481
You guys don't do
a head count before bed?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.018
I wasn't there
for lights out.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.687
But that's only
because these two kids
were causing trouble.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.523
I had to go up to the hotel
and find their parents...

13:10.657 --> 13:11.892
Wait.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.093
That's them.

13:18.966 --> 13:19.967
Now we run.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.103
Not so fast.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.197
The police are back.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.767
Any sign of the kids?

13:54.902 --> 13:56.336
The woods around here
are pretty dense.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.471
We're gonna need
to bring in more manpower
to help with the search.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.706
How long
will that take?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.509
I'm sure the police
are doing everything they can.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.011
Zoey:
What if they're never found?

14:05.045 --> 14:05.478
Like Savannah?

14:06.646 --> 14:09.049
You know, it's the anniversary
of when she disappeared.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.417
We're aware of that, miss.

14:10.884 --> 14:11.718
We all are.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.454
I'll keep you updated.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.025
Hey, kids, uh...

14:18.158 --> 14:19.726
Why don't you all
go upstairs and watch a movie?

14:20.793 --> 14:22.195
I'm gonna go
put some coffee on.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.267
I can't believe
this is happening.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.169
Again!

14:35.108 --> 14:36.176
(sighs)

14:39.947 --> 14:41.148
Wyatt:
Let's show him the tape.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.383
We caught a glimpse
of Savannah's ghost
last night.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.452
Creepy, right?

14:45.585 --> 14:47.587
Those cold, dead eyes
looking right through you.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.957
She didn't actually
have eyes.

14:50.090 --> 14:50.991
Or a face.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.660
How do you know
it was her?

14:53.793 --> 14:55.828
Ghosts?
Seriously?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.797
Griffin and Harper
ran away.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.366
It's all so crazy.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.134
No, it's not.

15:01.834 --> 15:02.869
Griffin hated it here.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.572
That was
before he met Harper.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.640
Things changed
after Griffin
fell in love.

15:07.774 --> 15:08.976
Wait, what?

15:09.109 --> 15:10.743
That's why
they've been
sneaking off,

15:10.877 --> 15:12.012
to kiss.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.314
I've been busting my butt
to cover for that?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.648
Gross, right?

15:15.782 --> 15:17.284
So not worth
getting grounded for.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.319
Harper will be
grounded a lot longer

15:19.452 --> 15:20.988
when the police
find them.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.622
If they find them.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.826
(indistinct chatter
on police radio)

15:27.427 --> 15:28.661
Where are we going?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.032
-Child Services.
-Harper: No!

15:32.165 --> 15:34.634
I mean... that's really
not necessary.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.970
Yeah, we have families
and homes.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.438
Good.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.839
I'll call your parents
to pick you up.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.741
Just need your real names.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.343
We already told you.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.877
officer 1:
No record at the hotel,

15:45.012 --> 15:46.713
and you're not campers.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.916
-How do you know Savannah?
-We're friends.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.484
officer 1:
From school?

15:51.618 --> 15:52.685
Instead of wasting time
with us,

15:52.819 --> 15:54.154
shouldn't you be out there,
looking for her?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.223
Trying to find her
before it's too late?

15:57.057 --> 15:58.458
officer 1:
What do you mean
by that?

16:01.528 --> 16:02.529
Why did you say that?

16:03.930 --> 16:04.897
Listen...

16:05.032 --> 16:06.766
If your friend is
in some kind of trouble,

16:06.899 --> 16:09.502
if somebody might have
done something,

16:09.636 --> 16:10.737
you need to tell me.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.472
We don't know anything.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.441
Jess might.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.977
I'm just saying
if it could help...

16:19.912 --> 16:21.348
officer 2: (over radio)
<i>Delta 5. Dispatch.</i>

16:21.481 --> 16:23.483
<i>Rescue found something</i>
<i>in the lake.</i>

16:23.616 --> 16:25.252
<i>We need you</i>
<i>to return to The Tremont.</i>

16:26.353 --> 16:28.055
officer 1:
Looks like we're taking
a little detour.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.392
(siren blaring)

16:34.361 --> 16:35.795
Think it's her?

16:35.928 --> 16:38.198
Has to be.
We've looked
everywhere else.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.500
Don't listen to them.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.835
They don't know Savannah
like we do.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.371
officer:
Hold there.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.772
Yeah, we definitely
got something here.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.007
(tense music playing)

16:48.841 --> 16:49.909
(officer grunts)

16:57.117 --> 16:58.918
(music intensifies)

17:02.689 --> 17:03.923
Sleeping bag.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.425
(exhales in relief)

17:07.494 --> 17:09.196
Come on, guys,
back up.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.597
Let the police
do their jobs.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.802
It's not her,
thank goodness.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.271
Okay, that's it.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.473
All campers back
to the bunkhouses now.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.075
Come on, let's go.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.078
What's wrong, Ben?

17:25.212 --> 17:27.547
It wasn't Savannah.
That's a good thing.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.616
I know.

17:31.050 --> 17:31.918
It's just...

17:34.821 --> 17:35.888
Never mind.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.963
(tense music playing)

17:46.699 --> 17:47.734
We'll keep looking.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.136
Call us the moment
you hear anything.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.036
We'll do the same.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.304
Do you have
a direct line?

17:51.438 --> 17:52.905
Of course.
Let me get you my card.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.309
Thank you.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.446
We should, uh...

17:59.579 --> 18:02.749
We should head back, too,
in case Harper's already home.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.484
Ready when you are.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.819
Go wait
in the car, honey.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.461
Don't worry.
We'll find 'em.

18:15.094 --> 18:15.995
I'm not going to--

18:16.129 --> 18:17.597
Let today end
the way that day did?

18:20.533 --> 18:21.434
That's what you said.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.670
I know.
I just meant--

18:23.803 --> 18:26.105
Look, Savannah's disappearance
changed all of us, Ben,

18:26.239 --> 18:28.141
but the way you were acting
that day, it's--

18:29.309 --> 18:31.778
It's like you knew something
the rest of us didn't.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.715
Do you know
what happened to her?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.118
Is that why you moved back
to Sulphur Springs?

18:42.589 --> 18:43.756
You were right, Jess.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.393
You should
probably head home.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.761
We'll call
if we hear anything.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.663
Right.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.099
I'll do the same.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.346
Here's Officer Stevens'
direct line and cell.

19:16.956 --> 19:17.957
(car door closes)

19:24.364 --> 19:26.633
officer: (on radio)
<i>Delta 5, we got an update</i>
<i>on the lake.</i>

19:27.434 --> 19:29.636
<i>Rescue reports false alarm.</i>

19:29.769 --> 19:31.170
<i>Just an old sleeping bag.</i>

19:32.004 --> 19:33.172
There's still time
to find her.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.307
All we have to do
is figure out

19:34.441 --> 19:36.243
how to break out
of a locked police car.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.545
Any ideas?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.113
Maybe if we had
a coat hanger...

19:41.248 --> 19:42.682
or a brick.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.284
Or someone we know.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.486
-Ben, over here!
-Yo, Ben!

19:46.619 --> 19:48.388
-Ben, help!
-Ben!

19:48.521 --> 19:50.089
Harper:
Ben, help! Over here!
Ben!

19:50.223 --> 19:51.658
-(banging on car)
-Griffin: Ben!

19:52.259 --> 19:54.193
(sighs)
Come on!

19:54.794 --> 19:55.962
He had to have heard us.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.464
Why didn't he stop?

19:57.597 --> 19:58.631
I don't know.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.767
He looked pretty upset though.

20:08.007 --> 20:13.513
Savannah?

20:14.614 --> 20:15.615
Hello?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.286
You really think
she's down here?

20:20.353 --> 20:21.288
Jess...

20:21.421 --> 20:22.622
That's ridiculous.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.723
Why would she--

20:25.392 --> 20:26.459
Wait.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.764
You don't think
she actually went through

20:31.898 --> 20:33.600
with that stupid dare?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.002
Do you?

20:37.604 --> 20:39.739
-I don't know. Maybe.
-Maybe?

20:40.507 --> 20:41.541
Wait, what does that mean?

20:43.543 --> 20:44.544
Ben, look at me!

20:46.112 --> 20:47.914
Did Savannah tell you
she was coming here last night?

20:49.015 --> 20:51.150
Is that why you were acting
so weird by the lake?

20:52.051 --> 20:52.585
Me?

20:53.553 --> 20:54.854
None of this would be
happening right now

20:54.987 --> 20:56.823
if it hadn't been for you
and your stupid dare.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.426
If anything,
this is all your fault.

21:03.896 --> 21:04.797
How could you?

21:06.933 --> 21:07.800
Jess...

21:08.601 --> 21:09.569
I'm sorry.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.371
I didn't mean it.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.017
What's going on here,
Bennett?

21:26.886 --> 21:27.820
Let's go.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.723
Totally unacceptable.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.024
I was with
an important client

21:32.158 --> 21:33.626
when I heard
that a camper
had disappeared.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.562
-Dad, please--
-And then I drive three hours

21:35.695 --> 21:37.530
to find you horsing around
the hotel like a clown.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.131
-I messed--
-A child is missing, Bennett!

21:39.265 --> 21:40.299
I'm sorry,
I messed up.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.401
Again and again
and again?

21:41.534 --> 21:42.835
You're not listening
to me.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.037
It's my fault.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.740
It's all my fault.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.881
Not...

21:55.014 --> 21:56.583
another...

21:56.716 --> 21:57.984
word.

22:13.199 --> 22:14.667
You heard that, right?

22:15.402 --> 22:16.503
My dad...

22:18.471 --> 22:19.539
He just confessed.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.212
Harper:
<i>Next time on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

22:26.345 --> 22:27.547
My dad said
it was all his fault.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.081
That has to mean he did
something to Savannah.

22:29.215 --> 22:30.817
Then why come back
to Sulphur Springs?

22:30.950 --> 22:34.421
Has Harper been going through
the boxes out in the garage?

22:34.554 --> 22:36.756
Your brother is missing
and you're worried
about a ghost?

22:36.889 --> 22:38.090
This is serious!

22:38.224 --> 22:40.993
Savannah (on tape):
<i>** ...could ever want **</i>

22:41.127 --> 22:45.532
<i>** Our hearts and minds</i>
<i>will always stay **</i>

22:45.665 --> 22:50.002
<i>** Here at dear</i>
<i>Camp Tremont **</i>
