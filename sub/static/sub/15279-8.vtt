15:21.588 --> 15:23.340
[Carlos]
It's really over.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.967
They have no witness,
they have no case.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.429
Sometimes things work out right,
Carlos.

15:29.513 --> 15:30.555
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.057
But you have to take this seriously,
okay?

15:33.141 --> 15:36.520
If you do anything like this again,
they're gonna come down on you hard.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.522
- As well they should.
- I understand.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.691
You saved me.

15:40.774 --> 15:44.194
I was happy to help out.
I think people deserve second chances.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.529
Yes.

15:46.321 --> 15:50.283
So you take good care of yourself.
Keep going to those meetings, Carlos.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.451
Of course.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.704
[Danny]
Hey, Sally Rayburn.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.623
I got a brunch menu here.
Why don't you take a look at it?

15:56.707 --> 15:59.501
- [Sally] Oh. Hi, honey.
- Hey, Carlos.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.797
Hey, how's the case going?

16:03.881 --> 16:05.883
They cut the charges for now.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.259
- Well done.
- Thanks.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.428
Congratulations.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.224
What are you gonna do
with your freedom?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.726
Not sure.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.854
I started looking for a job.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.190
Something will come up.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.818
Yeah. I'm happy for you, man.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.574
[Little Jake]
Hey.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.451
Who would've done this to you?

16:35.995 --> 16:39.541
- They take anything?
- I don't know. I had some cash in here.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.167
[Little Jake]
How much?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.002
Fuck.

16:43.754 --> 16:45.672
I don't even know.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.425
- Shit. We gotta report this.
- No.

16:48.508 --> 16:52.888
No, Jake. Come here. Listen, man.
No cops, okay? No cops.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.765
Why?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.934
This place is collateral for my loan.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.310
The bank is lending me money
based on my business.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.272
I can't fuck that up. I can't, okay?

17:05.483 --> 17:08.027
So you'll let whoever did this
just get away with it?

17:08.111 --> 17:09.613
Whoever has a name, trust me.

17:09.696 --> 17:14.284
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Forget it. Just no cops.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.786
Please.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.206
You're the boss.

17:20.874 --> 17:24.210
But you can't sleep here tonight.
You're gonna have to come to my place.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.421
No, thank you. I'm fine.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.966
Doctor says
I have to sleep sitting up anyway.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.259
Bed wouldn't do me any good.
Would you...?

17:32.844 --> 17:37.056
Fuck. Would you get me some water?
I have to take these pills.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.349
[Kevin groans]

17:40.393 --> 17:42.228
- Sure.
- Thank you.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.650
[Danny]
Hey, Mama.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.152
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, listen.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.030
I wanted to run something by you.
Completely your decision.

17:52.113 --> 17:55.951
I feel like we could use an extra pair
of hands around here, even part-time.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.161
All right.

17:58.912 --> 18:02.833
I was thinking, uh, Carlos.
I'm sure he could use a job.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.628
Yeah, I think that's a lovely idea
if you think you can use him.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.046
I'm fine with it.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.548
Yeah. I think I can put him to work.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.052
Thanks, Mama.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.437
[men speaking indistinctly]

18:26.064 --> 18:27.482
What?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.651
You say something?

18:29.734 --> 18:31.235
Me?

18:31.319 --> 18:33.404
No. No, that's not me.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.542
[♪♪♪]

18:48.753 --> 18:51.214
[Nicky]
There's no deal until there's a deal.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.800
My mother has a buyer,
but from what I understand,

18:53.884 --> 18:57.554
the loan hasn't come through yet.
All I'm asking is for you to be patient.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.681
You're not gonna get that
with the neighbors.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.307
The inlet stretches over a mile.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.732
[Marco]
Go, go! Okay, okay, okay.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.525
[festive Latin music

19:10.608 --> 19:12.694
Come on. What? What?

19:12.777 --> 19:14.654
[kids laughing and people chattering]

19:15.864 --> 19:19.200
I wanna dance. I wanna dance!
I wanna dance.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.493
I'm the crazy uncle.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.621
[all speaking in Spanish]

19:27.375 --> 19:29.669
Please, don't let
my daughter dance with you.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.964
Marco. Come sit.

19:33.048 --> 19:35.174
Sorry, I gotta go. The queen calls.

19:35.258 --> 19:38.011
- I gotta go talk to the queen.
- I never get to see you.

19:38.095 --> 19:41.180
Because I work, believe it or not.
Okay? I work.

19:41.264 --> 19:44.601
Me and John, yeah. I've been working
on this case with John 24-7.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.936
Uh-huh.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.647
- I love you. I love you.
- Work. It's always work.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.775
- [Marco] It is.
- Where's Meg?

19:52.233 --> 19:55.361
- Our little Meggie?
- Eh, she's working.

19:56.821 --> 19:59.741
- [Lucia] She's not coming?
- No. She's working with her mom.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.619
- Oh, no. I wanted to see her.
- [Anna] Daddy, come dance!

20:03.161 --> 20:05.830
[all laughing and speaking in Spanish]

20:10.209 --> 20:13.130
Thank God
she does not look like her father.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.506
He's very good-looking, just like you.

20:15.590 --> 20:18.426
But one of us is a little better-looking
than the other.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.639
I'm just saying. Trust me.
I live with him.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.267
Oh, look who's there.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.853
Meg! Megan. Megan!

20:28.937 --> 20:32.857
Hey, girl. Hi.
Your party looks awesome!

20:32.941 --> 20:36.235
[Anna] I can't believe you made it.
I can't believe you came.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.321
- [Meg] You look beautiful.
- [Anna] Thank you. You too.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.116
- [Meg] There you go. Happy birthday.
- [Anna] Thank you.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.493
- I'm so happy you came.
- Thank you.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.745
- I love your party.
- I know.

20:45.829 --> 20:49.332
- I thought she wasn't coming.
- I didn't know she was coming.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.541
We, uh...

20:51.751 --> 20:54.004
We really didn't think you were coming.

20:55.797 --> 20:58.299
I felt stupid.
I didn't wanna let Anna down.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.344
Well, thank you.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.347
I mean, she's dying that you're here.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.311
You don't have to stay long, okay?
I know I've created a...

21:11.146 --> 21:13.523
An uncomfortable situation.

21:15.192 --> 21:17.694
It's okay. We'll just have fun.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.085
[Danny] Hey there, Joe.
What you got for me today?

21:34.169 --> 21:37.463
- I got the best for you. Only the best.
- That's what I like to hear.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.216
Good with that, Carlos? Okay, cool.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.592
- Joe, this is Carlos.
- [Joe] Great.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.427
[Carlos]
Hello.

21:44.221 --> 21:45.889
Okay, man.

Hey, honey.

Open up. Wide.
There we go. Right back now.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.817
- [Carlos] I'm nervous about this.
- Close the door. Wait over there.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.606
[John]
Why didn't you call me sooner?

23:18.689 --> 23:20.608
[Kevin]
Because I didn't know what to do, man.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.735
[John]
You're gonna have to file a report.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.529
I can't. John, come here. Listen.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.158
Dude, if I file a report

23:28.241 --> 23:31.452
and then the bank starts asking me
questions, this loan goes south.

23:31.535 --> 23:35.665
And then I am fucked, man.
I mean, for real.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.501
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.754
You gotta be kidding me.
There goes the little fucker who did it.

23:42.130 --> 23:43.631
- Who?
- Nicky Widmark.

23:43.714 --> 23:45.925
Little prick and his Porsche.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.760
He doesn't want me buying this land.

23:47.844 --> 23:50.263
- Susan Widmark's kid?
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:50.347 --> 23:52.932
- He didn't do this.
- Then he sent somebody to do it.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.268
Check this out,
he comes up here the other day,

23:55.352 --> 23:57.520
walks right up to me,
I'm working on an engine,

23:57.603 --> 24:00.690
gets all up in my face,
he fucking threatens me.

24:00.773 --> 24:04.652
What did you do to him?
Just asking, what did you do to him?

24:04.735 --> 24:07.364
He fucking came at me, man.

24:09.115 --> 24:12.035
He didn't like the deal I made
with his mom.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.912
John.

24:14.996 --> 24:20.377
If I report this and this loan collapses,
then that little prick wins.

24:21.627 --> 24:25.882
I'm gonna lose it all.
And I can't let him, man.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.344
If it was him and you wanna prove it,
file a fucking report.

24:29.427 --> 24:33.472
Could you not be a cop? Just for once?
Please. Please.

24:33.556 --> 24:36.475
If you don't want me to report anything,
why did you call me?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.519
Because you're my big brother.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.271
And I'm fucked here, man.

24:40.355 --> 24:44.442
I don't know what the fuck to do.
I don't know what to do.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.027

25:00.708 --> 25:02.501
All right. Here's what we're gonna do.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.961
- Hey, buddy.
- What?

25:04.045 --> 25:06.339
- Here's what we're gonna do.
- Okay.

25:06.423 --> 25:09.008
You and I are gonna go
back to the house. We're--

25:09.092 --> 25:11.677
- Have you talked to Belle about this?
- No. Mom either.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.555
Hey, that's fine.
First things first. We go inside.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.725
We get things you'll need.
We go to the house. Let's do that.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.643
- I'm sorry. Come on.

I'm so sorry.

Then I blacked out.

When I woke up, Jake was there.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.835
He took me to the hospital.

- Oh, my God, Kevin.
- Mom, I'm fine.

25:50.174 --> 25:54.637
- [Sally] John, why would anybody do this?
- We're looking into it.

- But you have no idea?
- No. No.

25:56.597 --> 26:01.978
They were just looking for some money,
you know? It was just a burglary.

26:02.770 --> 26:05.064
Sounds personal, an attack like that.

26:05.148 --> 26:09.026
No reason to jump to conclusions.
We're looking into it. We don't know.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.529
Yeah, I gotta say, I agree with Meg.

26:11.612 --> 26:14.407
It just doesn't sound random.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.205
Where's Belle? Why isn't she here?

26:23.791 --> 26:26.669
Yeah, Mom. There's something else
I have to tell you.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.478
Hey.

Hi.

You wanna talk to me?

26:54.280 --> 26:55.698

Yeah.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.077
Remember when you told me
you weren't gonna make it

27:00.161 --> 27:03.206
to my niece's birthday party
and I told my whole family?

27:03.289 --> 27:05.791
I'm sorry.
I should have called you first.

27:05.875 --> 27:08.252
I saw the disappointment
all over their faces.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.962
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

27:10.046 --> 27:12.631
And then I realized
that I was disappointed.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.553
And how much I wanted you there.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.804
It was my fault.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.392
You weren't gonna be there
because I pushed you away.

27:22.475 --> 27:26.103
And then you went anyway because
you didn't want to let my family down.

27:27.397 --> 27:30.608
- I guess, yeah.
- Hm? You guess so?

27:32.860 --> 27:34.987
I've been an idiot, baby.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.866
What do you mean?

27:39.825 --> 27:42.036
Now you're being an idiot.

Mr. Rayburn, it's a small town.

It was just, literally, a minor incident.

30:18.192 --> 30:21.487
Somebody broke a window,
took just a little bit of cash.

30:21.571 --> 30:23.614
It was, like, a couple kids or something.

30:23.698 --> 30:26.867
Well, it's probably just a formality,
but we need 90 days

and see about your collateral.

I need to review the damage.

gonna be of any use to me anyway.

in a fight with Nicky Widmark
