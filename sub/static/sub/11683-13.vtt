40:22.645 --> 40:25.414
And then I came up
with a better idea.

40:25.481 --> 40:27.182
I'm staying
right at home.

40:27.249 --> 40:28.650
Ma.

40:28.717 --> 40:31.586
Michael.

40:31.654 --> 40:33.989
If all you guys
are going into hiding,

40:34.056 --> 40:37.025
you're gonna need a lifeline
to the outside world.

40:37.093 --> 40:39.928
You wanted to leave. I think
that's the best thing to do.

40:39.995 --> 40:41.129
And now
you want to stay.

40:41.196 --> 40:42.764
I was angry.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.132
I still am.

40:46.068 --> 40:47.368
There's a part of me

40:47.436 --> 40:50.705
that will <i>never</i> get over
what happened to Nate.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.043
If I don't forgive you,
I'll lose <i>you,</i> too.

40:58.013 --> 40:59.313
I'm staying.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.086
This is a fight
I can't win.

41:11.326 --> 41:12.593
Well,
you have two choices.

41:14.296 --> 41:17.332
You can give up now...

41:17.399 --> 41:19.901
or you can
go down swinging.
