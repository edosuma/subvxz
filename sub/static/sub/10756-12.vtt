Well, it all started three days ago.

You see, my father was very
concerned about his little dog, Eddie,

He said he can't find anything
wrong with him physically.

02:00.259 --> 02:01.817
Thinks it might be
an emotional problem.

02:02.019 --> 02:03.975
You know, I've heard
they have therapists for dogs.

02:04.139 --> 02:06.209
Do you suppose a dog psychiatrist
could be the answer?

02:06.379 --> 02:08.529
Only if the question is,
"What is the most asinine thing

02:08.699 --> 02:10.417
we could possibly do?"

02:11.379 --> 02:12.698
Maybe Eddie's just lonely.

02:12.859 --> 02:15.612
You know, I was thinking maybe
we could maybe get another...

02:15.779 --> 02:17.895
Stop right there, Dad.
We are not getting another dog.

02:18.059 --> 02:20.937
Oh, come on. What could be more fun
than having a little brother or sister

- I fell for that trick once, Dad.

Well, I'm gonna get
this little guy home.

Really? Well, if you have
an afternoon sometime,

maybe you could show me
all the hot spots.

03:07.659 --> 03:10.219
Oh, I think that could be arranged.

03:11.619 --> 03:14.008
I'd be happy to.
I'm free tomorrow afternoon.

- My pleasure.

A gorgeous doctor,
and I didn't get you anything.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.094
- So, what kind of doctor is he?
- A gynaecologist.

That's not funny.

03:36.699 --> 03:38.894
- What's the matter?
- He really is?

Oh, God. I can't go out
with a gynaecologist.

All right, I'll see you at home.

- Oh, God, no.

- See?
- Yeah, I wouldn't even date a dentist.

What would you imagine
human Eddie's first words to be?

10:49.659 --> 10:52.776
Well, I hope,
"Give me a breath mint."

10:53.459 --> 10:55.211
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:55.419 --> 10:56.534
All right, next one.

10:58.739 --> 11:01.811
What do you imagine would be
human Eddie's favourite cologne?

11:01.979 --> 11:05.654
Aqua Velva. It's a little strong,
but I think he can pull it off.

11:07.459 --> 11:11.088
Grey Flannel. I don't know why.

11:11.899 --> 11:15.687
Cologne? Well, actually, I think
he would prefer toilet water.

11:15.859 --> 11:20.569
Oh, by the way, same answer
for favourite beverage.

11:24.859 --> 11:28.488
I'm sensing a lot of hostility here.

11:28.659 --> 11:30.092
I'm sorry.
I just don't see the point.

11:30.259 --> 11:32.329
What is any of this telling you
about Eddie?

11:32.539 --> 11:35.258
The point was not to learn about Eddie,
but to learn about all of you.

11:35.419 --> 11:38.252
And might I say,
mission accomplished.

11:39.339 --> 11:42.137
Well, perhaps now would be
a good time for me

11:42.299 --> 11:46.008
to examine Eddie one-on-one.
Is there a room I can use?

11:46.219 --> 11:47.857
Oh, yeah. My room.
Second on the right.

11:48.259 --> 11:51.251
Eddie, after you.

11:52.819 --> 11:54.855
This may take a while.

11:56.419 --> 12:00.014
If Eddie were one of the Beatles,
I think he'd be George.

12:00.179 --> 12:02.409
I don't know why.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.811
And yet she's never been committed.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.249
I don't know why.

12:16.099 --> 12:17.214
<i>FRASIER:
Okay, I'll say it.</i>

12:17.379 --> 12:19.688
<i>What have they been
doing in there for the last hour?</i>

12:19.859 --> 12:22.931
He's probably just talking to him. Eddie
happens to be complex and interesting.

12:23.099 --> 12:26.535
Oh, yes. You must remind me to sit
beside him at his next dinner party.

12:28.139 --> 12:31.290
Well, be prepared. He'll be up
and down checking on that meat loaf.

12:34.659 --> 12:38.652
SHAW: I have my diagnosis.
- Finally, the white smoke.

12:40.819 --> 12:42.810
Eddie is indeed depressed.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.254
Now, if, as you say,
there's been no change in his routine,

12:45.419 --> 12:49.697
I can only surmise that he's reacting
to someone else's unhappiness.

12:50.059 --> 12:52.573
Is any one of you
suffering from depression?

12:52.739 --> 12:54.138
- Not me.
- Well, I'm not depressed.

12:54.299 --> 12:57.097
- Me either.
- I'm cheer personified.

12:58.739 --> 13:00.969
Well, he's picking it up somewhere.

13:01.619 --> 13:04.929
To be on the safe side, you should all
be conscious of how you behave

13:05.099 --> 13:10.048
when you're in front of him.
Try to speak in pleasant, happy tones.

13:10.259 --> 13:11.487
Goodbye, Eddie.

13:11.659 --> 13:13.570
Call me in a few days,
let me know how he's doing.

13:13.779 --> 13:16.577
Okay. Thanks for everything, doc.

13:16.739 --> 13:19.856
Sorry to rush off, but I have
a 4:00 appointment at the zoo.

13:20.019 --> 13:23.409
There's a hyena there
that won't even crack a smile.

13:25.019 --> 13:26.816
See, I can joke too.

13:31.579 --> 13:34.412
- Hold it.
- Oh, my God. Roz, what's happened?

13:34.579 --> 13:35.898
I wanna kill myself.

13:36.099 --> 13:39.136
Oh, hey, Roz, not in front of Eddie.

13:40.219 --> 13:42.289
- What?
- That gentleman that just left

13:42.459 --> 13:44.689
- was a dog psychiatrist.
- He said it'd be a good idea

13:44.859 --> 13:46.815
if we all had a happy tone
when we're around Eddie.

13:47.019 --> 13:49.692
So please, tell us,
why do you want to kill yourself?

13:50.739 --> 13:53.856
Well, I went out
with Dr Kagen, and we...

13:54.019 --> 13:56.897
Everything was going so great
that I almost forgot what he was.

13:57.059 --> 13:58.811
MARTIN: What is he?
- A gynaecologist.

13:58.979 --> 14:02.892
Oh, gee. I don't think I wanna hear
any more about this.

14:06.219 --> 14:07.538
All right, Roz, what happened?

14:07.699 --> 14:09.257
Well, we went upstairs
to his apartment,

14:09.419 --> 14:11.455
and he poured a glass of wine and...

14:12.339 --> 14:15.411
Well, do you know
what a speculum is?

14:15.819 --> 14:21.689
Apparently, he was an avid collector
of antique gynaecological equipment.

14:23.099 --> 14:25.772
I've just gotten the signal from Roz
that we're running out of time,

14:25.939 --> 14:28.578
so I'll skip ahead in our story.

14:36.539 --> 14:38.848
If you ask me, the man's theory's
a whole lot of hooey.

14:39.019 --> 14:41.010
Who here has any reason
to be unhappy?

14:41.179 --> 14:45.252
Well, mind you, I would never say this
if it weren't for Eddie's sake,

14:45.419 --> 14:47.296
but comparatively speaking,

14:47.459 --> 14:49.814
Dr Crane, you have the most
to be depressed about.

14:49.979 --> 14:52.209
What with your separation
from Mrs Crane and all.

14:52.419 --> 14:54.011
Well, I'm not unhappy.

14:54.179 --> 14:55.532
Besides, I don't even live here.

14:55.739 --> 14:58.173
Oh, please, you're here
more than I am.

14:59.259 --> 15:02.137
You know, I hate to say it, but, Dad,
if anybody's giving off unhappiness,

15:02.299 --> 15:03.288
I'm afraid it's you.

15:03.499 --> 15:04.488
- Me?
FRASIER: Yes.

15:04.659 --> 15:07.127
You're the one who hasn't
had a date in a year.

15:07.339 --> 15:10.934
- Not to mention two failed marriages.
- And yet you did.

15:12.059 --> 15:15.495
Well, I don't know,
maybe I am not entirely happy.

15:15.659 --> 15:17.172
Why should I be?

15:17.339 --> 15:19.091
My son lives across the country.

15:19.259 --> 15:21.489
There's no woman in my life.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.731
Maybe it is I
who is making Eddie sad.

15:24.939 --> 15:27.499
Oh, now, now,
don't you take all the blame.

15:27.699 --> 15:31.408
If I give my life a good once-over,
I realize it's not all jam.

15:31.579 --> 15:34.332
I've just lost the only boyfriend
I've had in years,

15:34.499 --> 15:37.969
and the biggest thing in my life is that
I got all my hair cut off months ago,

15:38.139 --> 15:40.972
- and no one's even mentioned it.
ALL: You got your hair cut off?

15:41.179 --> 15:42.851
Oh, shut up.

15:46.139 --> 15:49.609
Daphne, maybe you were right earlier.
I'm not so happy.

15:49.819 --> 15:51.457
Oh, maybe it's me.

15:51.619 --> 15:54.179
My life hasn't been a picnic
since Hester died.

15:54.339 --> 15:57.570
Now that I think about it,
what have I got to be happy about?

15:57.739 --> 15:59.650
I mean, I know that has
nothing to do with Eddie,

15:59.819 --> 16:02.379
but maybe Frasier picked up
something from contact with me.

16:02.579 --> 16:05.730
He wouldn't be the first one who...
Oh, I'm too depressed.

16:07.059 --> 16:10.369
How loosely woven is the fabric
of our happiness.

16:10.539 --> 16:11.813
A tug or two,

16:11.979 --> 16:16.530
and it unravels to reveal how empty
our everyday lives really are.

16:16.739 --> 16:18.491
Then there are the empty nights...

16:18.659 --> 16:23.016
...accompanied by thoughts
of loneliness and death.

16:23.219 --> 16:24.891
You think about that too?

16:25.059 --> 16:28.574
- Thought it was just me.
- Everybody thinks about it.

16:29.059 --> 16:32.096
Do you lie real still
and hold your breath...

16:32.259 --> 16:34.011
...and pretend you're in the ground?

16:34.219 --> 16:36.255
No, that's just you.

16:38.699 --> 16:41.452
When I die, I want it to be
on my 100th birthday,

16:41.619 --> 16:43.416
in my beach house on Maui,

16:43.579 --> 16:47.936
and I want my husband to be so upset
he has to drop out of college.

16:51.219 --> 16:54.848
You know, I once had a psychic
tell me the strangest thing.

16:55.059 --> 16:58.574
That one day I would go off me rocker,
take up a kitchen knife,

16:58.739 --> 17:01.492
kill the entire household
and then kill myself.

17:01.659 --> 17:03.809
Silly old bag.

17:04.699 --> 17:07.816
She was right about my moving
to Seattle, though.

17:13.219 --> 17:15.210
Well, I don't know how I wanna go,

17:15.419 --> 17:18.694
but all my years around the police
morgue taught me a few things.

17:18.858 --> 17:22.771
First off, you don't wanna swallow
Drano or rat poison.

17:22.939 --> 17:27.329
And if you're gonna kill yourself
with an axe, get it right the first time.

17:32.819 --> 17:37.449
Well, you know, we can talk about it,
we can think about it...

17:37.619 --> 17:40.417
...but nobody really knows
how or when.

17:40.619 --> 17:43.531
One second we're as alive
as anyone else, and then...

17:43.699 --> 17:44.973
...what?

17:45.939 --> 17:49.170
Darkness. Nothingness.

17:50.019 --> 17:51.611
Afterlife?

17:51.779 --> 17:55.408
I've always liked the notion of meeting
the great figures of history.

17:55.579 --> 17:57.251
Then I think,
what if it's like high school,

17:57.419 --> 18:00.570
and all the really cool dead people
don't wanna hang out with me?

18:03.819 --> 18:06.208
Mozart will tell me he's busy,
but then later I'll see him out

18:06.379 --> 18:08.176
with Shakespeare and Lincoln.

18:09.859 --> 18:12.498
I don't know about you, but this
is depressing the hell out of me.

18:12.699 --> 18:14.894
Remember, my number's coming up
sooner than you guys.

18:15.059 --> 18:17.527
ROZ: Wow, that's right.
NILES: That's a good point, yeah.

18:21.179 --> 18:23.647
No, no. None of us really knows
when our time is up.

18:23.859 --> 18:25.212
And it's never long enough.

18:25.379 --> 18:28.212
My great-grandmother
was 92 years old when she died,

18:28.379 --> 18:31.291
and her last words to me
from her deathbed were,

18:31.459 --> 18:33.290
"It's so short."

18:35.179 --> 18:36.851
Of course, it was the '70s.

18:37.019 --> 18:39.897
She could've been
talking about my skirt.

18:42.939 --> 18:49.014
<i>I have seen the eternal Footman
hold my coat, and snicker</i>

18:49.219 --> 18:50.652
T.S. Eliot.

18:50.859 --> 18:52.133
Dead.

18:53.979 --> 18:57.574
Must not all things at the last
be swallowed up in death?

18:57.779 --> 18:58.973
Plato.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.737
Even deader.

19:03.299 --> 19:06.814
You know, perhaps
Dr Shaw was right.

19:07.019 --> 19:11.649
Perhaps we are the cause
of Eddie's depression.

19:13.459 --> 19:15.336
Simple beast.

19:15.499 --> 19:19.492
He has peered beneath
the masks of happiness we all wear...

19:19.659 --> 19:22.332
...and seen what lurks below,

19:22.499 --> 19:24.251
infected by our sorrow.

19:24.419 --> 19:29.698
His once carefree doggy world
has been shattered, perhaps forever.

19:29.899 --> 19:32.015
Well, look at him. He's happy again.

19:32.219 --> 19:34.813
Could that have been all it was?
He was missing his favourite doll?

19:34.979 --> 19:36.970
FRASIER: Well, I guess
Dr Shaw was wrong after all.

19:37.139 --> 19:38.731
He wasn't taking his cue
from us, was he?

19:38.899 --> 19:41.367
Well, we were certainly
taking a cue from Eddie.

19:41.539 --> 19:44.736
- I've never been so depressed.
ROZ: Tell me about it.

19:44.899 --> 19:46.696
Yeah, I wish I was a dog.

19:46.899 --> 19:49.732
All it takes is a little toy
to make him happy again.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.453
I'm afraid we're a bit more complex
than that, Daphne.

19:52.619 --> 19:56.453
We know for whom the bell tolls.

19:57.459 --> 19:58.858
[BELL RINGS]

20:02.019 --> 20:04.055
Anybody else hear that?

20:09.099 --> 20:11.374
Oh, the biscuits.

20:12.259 --> 20:14.819
Daphne, by "biscuits"
do you mean cookies?

20:15.019 --> 20:16.771
- Yeah, that's right.
MARTIN: Oh, they smell good.

20:16.939 --> 20:18.338
FRASIER: Yeah.
NILES: Fresh from the oven.

20:18.499 --> 20:19.932
ROZ: All nice and warm.
DAPHNE: Yeah.

20:20.139 --> 20:22.016
And I have a fresh
pitcher of milk for dipping.

20:22.219 --> 20:24.449
FRASIER: Oh, and I believe
there's ice cream too.

20:24.619 --> 20:25.972
ALL:
Ooh!

20:26.139 --> 20:30.178
And so, Alice, even the happiest of us
can find reasons to be unhappy

20:30.339 --> 20:31.738
if only we look for them.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.452
So don't look for them.

20:33.619 --> 20:38.249
Take a tip from our dog friends,
and treat yourself to your favourite toy.

20:38.459 --> 20:40.768
Whatever that might be.

20:40.979 --> 20:42.378
<i>ALICE:
I'll do that right now.</i>

20:42.539 --> 20:45.895
<i>Thank you, Dr Crane.
I really do feel better.</i>

20:46.059 --> 20:48.857
This is Dr Frasier Crane,
reminding everyone

20:49.059 --> 20:52.938
that life is too short to dwell
on every bump in the road.

20:53.099 --> 20:56.694
Try to take pleasure
in the simple things.

20:56.859 --> 20:58.577
In short,

20:58.739 --> 21:00.491
eat a cookie.

21:02.099 --> 21:03.418
Ow! Oh!

21:03.979 --> 21:06.015
Walnut. I broke a tooth.

21:07.779 --> 21:09.337
Oh, now I gotta go to the dentist.

21:09.499 --> 21:13.890
Gonna tell me I haven't flossed, my
lip's gonna get all fat. My life sucks.
