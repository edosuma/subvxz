00:09.634 --> 00:11.428
<i>You shall not eat of the fruit!</i>

00:11.511 --> 00:12.762
- <i>Daddy, I wasn't!</i>
- <i>I'm going to teach you</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:14.055
<i>about shame.</i>

00:14.139 --> 00:15.765
Could you give this
to Marisol for me

00:15.849 --> 00:18.059
next time you see her?

00:18.143 --> 00:20.895
I've enlisted, and I'll
be shipping out soon.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.607
I love you. I want to know
everything about you.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.736
No. You don't.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.447
What happened?
What did you do?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.782
Why do you assume it
was something I did?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.451
I've heard the Parsons have

00:34.534 --> 00:36.453
at least ten people living
inside of that home.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.538
- How did you get that information?
- What does it matter

00:38.621 --> 00:39.956
where I got the
information? Is it true?

00:40.039 --> 00:42.792
Do you have all these tenants
living under your roof?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.127
I'm fighting a war, Susan.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.463
So are we.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.715
If we can get the IRS
to recognize

00:48.798 --> 00:50.592
Thelema as a religion,
officially,

00:50.675 --> 00:53.094
then our house would become
a church, like you said.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.637
What do you want me to do?

00:54.721 --> 00:56.014
I want you to cut

00:56.097 --> 00:58.224
the head off the snake.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.815
<i>Tighter.</i>

01:08.526 --> 01:09.944
<i>Tell me</i>

01:10.028 --> 01:10.945
what you want.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.697
To vanquish my enemies.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.554
Susan?

01:36.638 --> 01:37.972
Thank God you're awake.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.724
I-I was waiting for you.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.142
What happened?

01:41.226 --> 01:42.685
Jack stood before me,

01:42.769 --> 01:45.647
and I was ready
to sacrifice him.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.859
When I raised the knife
in my hand, I saw...

01:49.943 --> 01:52.195
Saw what?

01:57.784 --> 02:01.162
Jack was transformed
into the angel Azazel

02:01.246 --> 02:03.248
with wings of holy fire.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.877
I-I'd seen him
once before.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.547
And I was worried that I
would never see him again.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.842
And then, the
angel spoke to me.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.177
Well, that's not
quite right. He, uh...

02:16.261 --> 02:17.720
I felt him here.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.598
And he stayed my hand.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.726
See, I thought
<i>I</i> wanted to kill Jack.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.562
But as the
angel showed me,

02:25.645 --> 02:27.730
I was just carrying out
the will of another.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.816
Tell them whose will, exactly.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.696
Virgil Byrne's.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.536
You haven't
just betrayed

02:41.619 --> 02:43.580
Frater J.P.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.582
You have betrayed us all.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.584
<i>That the forces of vice</i>

02:47.667 --> 02:49.085
and corruption have found

02:49.168 --> 02:52.046
- no refuge here in our county.
- Mr. and Mrs. Byrne. Hello.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.882
It's very nice to see you.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.174
Thank you so
much for your support.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.594
Mrs. Van Buren.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.095
Oh.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.556
Thank you for opening
your magnificent home.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.266
Nonsense, Mr.
District Attorney.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.602
It is my pleasure
and my duty

03:05.685 --> 03:07.729
to see that you get
four more years.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.148
All I ask is that you
don't forget Pasadena

03:10.231 --> 03:12.066
on the way to the
governor's office.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.278
Oh, well, Sacramento can wait.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.988
There's too much to
clean up around here.

03:17.071 --> 03:20.033
Warren, allow me
to walk you to your car.

03:26.998 --> 03:30.043
You had them eating out
of the palm of your hand.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.628
Appreciate the introduction.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.004
Well, the diocese,

03:33.087 --> 03:35.131
like the Orange Grove
Preservation Society,

03:35.214 --> 03:37.091
is fully committed
to your reelection.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.093
Cut to the chase.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.596
This is the part where
you ask me for another favor.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.015
Well, I'd like to think
that we are united

03:44.098 --> 03:46.768
in our efforts against
a common enemy.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.314
That wretched cult is
trying to incorporate.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.942
Now, if they gain religious
status, fighting them

03:54.025 --> 03:56.319
will become all
the more difficult.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.321
We're in a war
against the fascists.

03:58.404 --> 04:01.115
I can't be seen
prosecuting religious groups

04:01.199 --> 04:03.284
whose beliefs
I don't happen to share.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.953
Especially not
an election year.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.789
Well, this isn't about
religious persecution.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.707
The First Amendment
cannot be used as a cover

04:09.791 --> 04:11.334
for criminal activity.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.170
This is deviancy.
Sodomy. Animal sacrifice.

04:14.253 --> 04:15.338
It's all just hearsay.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.839
You haven't given me
any proof.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.300
What if I could?

04:19.384 --> 04:22.011
Well, I'm sure
that Mrs. Van Buren

04:22.095 --> 04:24.847
and everyone on Orange Grove
would give almost anything

04:24.931 --> 04:27.725
to see this situation
dealt with.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.856
These brunches
are gonna start costing

04:33.940 --> 04:36.401
a lot more than $50 a plate.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.413
We can't
put this off any longer.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.207
It's clear he'll stop
at nothing.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.084
We need to bolster our defenses.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.087
The appearance of the angel
guarantees Ernest's devotion.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.006
He's no longer a threat.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.174
I'm talking about Virgil.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.719
Look, if we can officially make
this house a church, then...

05:02.802 --> 05:05.054
You mean if I give the
house to the Agape?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.723
You wouldn't be
giving it away.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.266
- <i>We</i> would be.
- But it was my money

05:08.349 --> 05:09.892
that paid for it,

05:09.976 --> 05:11.352
and I'd be the one
signing the deed over.

05:12.979 --> 05:16.399
Look, I shouldn't
even be telling you this,

05:16.482 --> 05:19.152
but there's about to be
a very important test at work,

05:19.235 --> 05:21.779
and assuming it succeeds...
which I know it will...

05:21.863 --> 05:25.199
I will become an even more vital
part of the war effort.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.743
Well, how does that help us?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.703
Because men as
powerful as Roosevelt

05:28.786 --> 05:30.038
will be standing behind us,

05:30.121 --> 05:32.331
ready to crush Virgil
if he keeps it up.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.044
- So we do nothing?
- That's not what I'm saying.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.254
But if we have to give up
our house to defend ourselves,

05:38.337 --> 05:40.214
then what exactly
are we defending?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.758
Our way of life.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.760
I conjured
a goddamn angel, Susan.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.845
I think I can handle
your stepfather.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.431
What is this?

05:48.514 --> 05:49.932
Sausage coming up in a minute.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.310
Frater E.D. has been up
all morning atoning.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.395
Please, join us. We all helped.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.938
Not everyone.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.231
You've done so much for us,

05:57.315 --> 05:59.776
and we rarely show
our appreciation.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.111
Thank you. Um...

06:02.195 --> 06:05.031
There's enough
to feed a whole village.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.116
Please, help yourselves.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.754
Something the matter?

06:19.837 --> 06:22.381
I think they're all just
keen to hear more about the angel.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.801
What was it like

06:24.884 --> 06:26.469
when it took over your body?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.471
Um, well...

06:28.554 --> 06:31.766
Honestly,

06:31.849 --> 06:35.144
I can't really remember.
I just sort of blacked out.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.146
Crowley describes

06:37.230 --> 06:39.982
his encounter with Aiwass
as a rapture.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.361
Yet you felt nothing at all?

06:43.444 --> 06:46.489
Well, I guess I felt something.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.616
Like...

06:50.368 --> 06:52.829
I don't know,
a kind of raw power

06:52.912 --> 06:56.124
that was surging
through my body.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.792
Do you feel it now?

06:57.875 --> 06:59.168
Uh, yeah.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.003
Yeah. Um...

07:01.087 --> 07:05.341
it's almost like...
I'm still vibrating.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.510
Like a cymbal that's been struck

07:07.593 --> 07:09.387
by the hand of God himself.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.972
Yeah.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.473
I think I can feel it.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.058
Careful, baby.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.018
Don't want you
getting all shook up.

07:16.102 --> 07:20.356
I just find it strange that
Azazel should choose to speak

07:20.439 --> 07:21.858
through a vessel.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.860
When Frater E.D. saw it
for the first time,

07:23.943 --> 07:25.862
the angel appeared on its own.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.530
I don't
understand it, either,

07:27.613 --> 07:30.074
but I guess that's the nature
of miracles.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.409
That's what it was.
A miracle.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.327
- Bacon?
- Yeah, please.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.163
Indeed.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.542
Parsons residence.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.837
It's been quite a while
since we had a session.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.006
With these revelations,

07:45.089 --> 07:48.050
I'd say now is the time.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.260
I would be happy to.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.511
I have so many questions myself.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.930
That was General
Braxton's office.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.098
But I'm afraid it's
gonna have to wait.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.892
I've got a war to win.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.393
Excuse me.

07:59.437 --> 08:03.024
Well, at least we know
the angels are on our side.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.358
I'm just saying,
his arm was warm

08:04.442 --> 08:05.526
when I touched it just now.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.195
Arms are always warm, baby.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.362
Okay, you know what I mean.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.572
Like electricity
flowing through it.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.949
Yeah, yeah, I knew a dancer
in Sonnenberg,

08:12.033 --> 08:13.409
and she'd seen her angel.

08:13.492 --> 08:15.661
She was a changed person
forever after.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.131
Let's
get it going!

08:33.346 --> 08:34.429
Yeah, he's good!

08:36.974 --> 08:39.393
I'll take it.
Got it?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.977
Careful of the nose.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.480
- Watch the wings.
- Yes, sir.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.566
Let's get these
hookups ready.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.154
Gentle.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.406
Next.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.408
Good work.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.411
Om...

09:40.037 --> 09:41.539
Om...

09:41.622 --> 09:43.291
What are you doing?

09:43.374 --> 09:47.086
Making sure everything goes
the way it's supposed to.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.298
Ready for launch.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.341
Copy that.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.473
Ad astra...

09:59.557 --> 10:01.309
...per aspera.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.129
First flight at 2.85 miles.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.006
Yes!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.094
I am Heaven.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.598
There is no other God than me.

11:53.170 --> 11:57.800
You have become
a rudderless ship

11:57.883 --> 12:00.970
turned around
on a dark sea.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.098
You cannot tell bow from stern,

12:04.181 --> 12:07.017
truth from lies.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.603
Thus, to see clearly,

12:09.687 --> 12:14.191
you must upend your
entire view on the world

12:14.275 --> 12:20.823
until your lies spill out
like water.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.658
There are no more lies.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.827
There are no more doubts.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.954
Doubt is central to our faith.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.665
Without it, we cannot know
what we truly believe.

12:29.748 --> 12:33.961
The second appearance of
the angel proved it was real.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.046
I'm ready to make the crossing.

12:36.130 --> 12:40.801
Before I'd even consider
helping you,

12:40.885 --> 12:43.679
I need to know the being you saw

12:43.762 --> 12:45.639
was your holy guardian angel,

12:45.723 --> 12:50.019
and not some other entity.

12:50.102 --> 12:54.106
You were the one who said Jack
was the key to my liberation.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.649
We live in his house.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.401
He has more power now.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.239
Maybe your doubt is just
another word for jealousy.

13:09.163 --> 13:13.375
I may not own the house,

13:13.459 --> 13:17.379
but I am still the Magus.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.216
Azazel came when Jack
summoned him,

13:20.299 --> 13:21.884
not when you did.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.847
You are still far too impure

13:26.931 --> 13:29.058
to ascend any further.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.228
Tell me...

13:32.311 --> 13:36.440
what I must do
to purify myself?

13:41.153 --> 13:44.114
That answer...

13:44.198 --> 13:46.408
must come from you.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.875
<i>Sí, señor, todos somos pobres.</i>

13:54.959 --> 13:57.378
<i>Pero todos necesitamos vivir.</i>

13:59.296 --> 14:00.214
Wow.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.925
You are gonna get this.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.718
I hope so.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.887
Because last time I auditioned
for this casting director,

14:06.971 --> 14:08.430
he said I was too Mexican.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.933
And the time before that,
he said I wasn't Mexican enough.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.226
Hey, dolls.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.728
Steaks all around
for me and my boys.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.730
Well, coming right up.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.816
Do you want to take this one?

14:18.899 --> 14:22.820
These types always tip big.

14:24.863 --> 14:26.282
Mari?

14:26.365 --> 14:30.160
Oh, n-no, Connie, you take it.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.413
I got to make a call.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.790
Do what thou wilt shall
be the whole of the law.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.917
That's what we say,
may even be how we live,

14:37.001 --> 14:40.254
but all we do here is meant
to serve a higher purpose.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.131
Now, my eyes have been opened.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.759
I've seen the error of my ways.
I must make amends.

14:45.843 --> 14:46.927
By gardening?

14:47.011 --> 14:49.138
We have been mooching off of

14:49.221 --> 14:51.265
the Parsons' kindness
for far too long.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.766
It's time we pitched in.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.144
And so, we are going to make
a Victory Garden.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.313
But not just victory abroad;

14:57.396 --> 15:00.482
victory over the hate
in our hearts.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.818
Frater E.D.

15:02.901 --> 15:05.279
Someone just called for you.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.281
What the hell are y'all doing?

15:07.364 --> 15:09.950
We're planting a garden, baby.
An offering to the angel.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.203
Baby, we left Alabama to get
away from this kind of work.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.788
Oh, this is not just
hard labor.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.373
This is in service
of a divine messenger.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.460
Uh-huh.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.337
Lester Young's playing a set
at the Dunbar.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.255
- Oh.
- Come with.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.465
But I was just about
to get star...

15:24.548 --> 15:27.217
No buts. Come on now.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.970
Hold on a second.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.181
Who'd you say called?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.224
Oh, yeah.
The power company.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.851
Said your bill was past due.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.895
Figured it must be
some kind of a mistake.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.315
Probably.

15:48.906 --> 15:49.948
<i>It's not a religion</i>

15:50.032 --> 15:52.534
so much as a technique
for getting anything you want

15:52.618 --> 15:54.995
by focusing on it
and making it real.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.206
And that's how Mr. Parsons
contacted an angel?

15:57.289 --> 15:59.833
Crowley believes we all have
an angel inside of us.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.168
If we can contact it,
we can become

16:01.251 --> 16:02.836
exactly who we want to be.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.506
You mean you don't want to be
an Aerojet secretary forever?

16:07.424 --> 16:09.885
If you want to learn more,
we hold a mass every full moon.

16:09.968 --> 16:13.430
Patty, in my office, now.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.402
What have I told you?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.529
What happens at home
is only meant to be shared

16:28.612 --> 16:30.239
with those who are
ready to listen.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.908
I know, but did you see
their faces?

16:32.991 --> 16:34.368
The miracle with the angel
is the best advertising

16:34.451 --> 16:36.286
we could hope for.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.289
Recruiting new believers is not
my chief concern right now.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.041
Why not?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.418
The bigger our congregation,
the harder it'll be

16:42.501 --> 16:45.087
- for him to get at us.
- We work for the military.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.256
If they catch any talk
of the Agape,

16:47.339 --> 16:49.174
they could shut us
down for good.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.139
I get it.

16:55.222 --> 16:59.601
Prophets are rarely understood
in their own time.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.228
But can you imagine

17:01.311 --> 17:03.272
an army of true believers

17:03.355 --> 17:06.442
hanging on your every word?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.318
I can.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.201
Mr. Parsons' office.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.414
It's Ernest.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.258
Maybe this was
a bad idea.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.178
Why don't you sit down?

17:34.261 --> 17:35.929
What's taking so long?

17:36.013 --> 17:39.391
Soon it will be done,
and we will have our church.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.311
I already feel like I betrayed
Jack once, and now this.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.147
It's not the first time you've
signed something for him.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.149
Usually it's just
mortgage checks,

17:47.232 --> 17:48.609
not signing the whole
house away.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.527
You're not signing
anything away.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.322
You are turning it
into something greater.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.616
I don't think Jack would
see it like that, considering...

17:55.699 --> 18:00.120
What happened between us
was a <i>working.</i>

18:00.204 --> 18:03.332
To vanquish our enemies.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.501
Here we are.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.128
- He almost died.
- You couldn't have known.

18:08.212 --> 18:12.800
No, but maybe the universe is
trying to tell us something.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.680
That is not the universe.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.974
That is your own shame.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.643
And you know where
that comes from.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.229
Your step-father instilled it in you,

18:25.312 --> 18:30.025
trying to control who
you could and could not fuck.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.986
And now Jack is doing
exactly the same.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.488
What are you talking about?

18:34.571 --> 18:37.407
He made it very clear
that your new arrangement

18:37.491 --> 18:39.201
doesn't apply to me,

18:39.284 --> 18:42.329
and that there would be
serious consequences.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.206
When did he lay down
this restriction?

18:44.289 --> 18:45.749
Just before I broke it.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.379
Which is what I find
so galling about

18:50.462 --> 18:52.339
his so-called conjuring
of the angel.

18:52.422 --> 18:56.343
That a man who truly does not
practice what we preach

18:56.426 --> 18:59.346
would be a divine messenger.

18:59.429 --> 19:01.223
Mrs. Parsons?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.016
Sorry for the delay.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.726
I had trouble finding
your application

19:04.810 --> 19:07.020
because it's been put on hold.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.522
Uh, it shouldn't be.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.524
I have the final
requirement here.

19:10.607 --> 19:11.608
The quitclaim for the deed.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.402
That's not the problem.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.571
There's a note on the file.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.045
You're late.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.464
I didn't realize
I worked for you.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.095
Mrs. Van Buren has spotted
Jack Parsons

19:40.178 --> 19:42.764
on multiple occasions,
coming out of his home,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.725
hale as an ox.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.147
Have you ever killed a man?

19:52.858 --> 19:56.570
Once, at Château-Thierry.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.447
Then you'll know it ain't easy.

19:58.530 --> 20:02.242
Well, I'd be lying if I didn't
admit some part of me

20:02.326 --> 20:05.120
was relieved when I heard
you hadn't carried it out.

20:05.203 --> 20:09.166
Love for my daughter
can push me to extremes

20:09.249 --> 20:11.752
in the name of saving her.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.795
You have to be careful
fighting monsters,

20:13.879 --> 20:16.131
or you might turn
into one yourself.

20:16.214 --> 20:19.176
Precisely.

20:19.259 --> 20:23.180
Which is why,
rather than breaking the law,

20:23.263 --> 20:26.767
I've found a way to use it
to our advantage.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.311
And it requires you
to drop this ruse

20:29.394 --> 20:32.773
and reveal our association.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.484
For that reason,
it is the last task

20:35.567 --> 20:37.277
I will ever ask of you.

20:41.698 --> 20:45.369
<i>Todos somos pobres, pero todos
necesitamos vivir.</i>

20:45.452 --> 20:48.538
<i>Vivir. Sí, señor. Sí, señor...</i>

20:48.622 --> 20:51.208
Marisol?

20:51.291 --> 20:53.460
What are you doing here?

20:53.543 --> 20:55.879
Can we talk, please?

20:57.631 --> 21:00.509
You've gone back
to waitressing?

21:00.592 --> 21:02.135
I'm acting again.

21:02.219 --> 21:05.806
Oh. Okay.

21:05.889 --> 21:10.143
Things are pretty good
on my end, too.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.145
I'm happy for you.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.732
But the thing is...

21:15.816 --> 21:17.526
I'm not happy.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.821
Because I've only been able
to think about you.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.197
- Richard...
- No, please.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.283
Just let me finish.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.870
I know now how stupid I was

21:28.954 --> 21:31.331
to go see your family
without asking.

21:31.415 --> 21:35.210
And... I'm so sorry

21:35.293 --> 21:38.463
for my idiotic comment.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.217
You were living in my world,

21:42.300 --> 21:46.179
surrounded by people
constantly judging you,

21:46.263 --> 21:47.848
and then I do the same thing.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.477
Oh...

21:52.561 --> 21:56.189
I'm-I'm not...
I'm not proposing.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.526
It's just...

21:59.609 --> 22:02.195
I bought you this ring, and...

22:02.279 --> 22:04.406
you never even had
a chance to see it.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.931
I accept everything about you.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.767
Even the things I don't know,

22:31.850 --> 22:33.560
even the things that
you don't want to tell me,

22:33.643 --> 22:36.271
because whatever they are,
they made you you.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.565
That's easy to say...

22:38.648 --> 22:40.776
Damn it, Marisol.
How bad could it be?

22:40.859 --> 22:45.280
We got past you being in
that-that group of Jack's

22:45.363 --> 22:46.615
when we first met.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.575
Because you don't know
anything about it,

22:48.658 --> 22:50.827
- or what happened there.
- That's my point.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.913
I don't need to know.
It's all in the past.

22:52.996 --> 22:54.581
- I have to go.
- No, please, I...

22:54.664 --> 22:58.794
I can't, Richie.
Richard.

23:00.378 --> 23:03.548
I'm sorry.
You deserve better.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.766
<i>I know a forked tongue
when I see one,</i>

23:12.849 --> 23:14.559
- even if no one else here does.
- What is that supposed to mean?

23:14.643 --> 23:15.769
You know what,
you blind, brother.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.813
- You should listen to your girl.
- No, get him the fuck out!

23:17.896 --> 23:18.939
You can get rid of me,
you can't get rid of him!

23:19.022 --> 23:21.274
What is the meaning of this?

23:21.358 --> 23:22.818
Tell him.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.946
Tell the Magus how you
betrayed us <i>again.</i>

23:26.029 --> 23:28.365
Virgil asked me to come see him,
and I went.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.866
What? Why?

23:29.950 --> 23:31.952
Because I told him to.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.621
If Virgil thinks Ernest
is still doing his bidding,

23:34.704 --> 23:36.540
we'll be able to figure out
what he's planning next.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.833
Oh, we figured
it out, all right.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.501
The D.A. is building
a case against us.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.877
Aren't we protected now?

23:40.961 --> 23:42.337
Our efforts to get
certified as a church

23:42.420 --> 23:43.839
were blocked by this case.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.299
- They will look into us all?
- Yeah.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.884
And Ernest is the key witness
for the prosecution.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.512
The D.A. wants to meet with him.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.514
Frater E.D.
is on our side.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.890
We're being tested by the angel.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.684
Ah, fuck this angel.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.602
None of us were there.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.854
How we even know
if it was real?

23:58.937 --> 24:00.313
Son of a bitch!

24:01.565 --> 24:03.024
Please, please. Frater E.D.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.901
Ernest!

24:04.985 --> 24:05.986
Let him go.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.534
Can't you see we have a mole?

24:12.617 --> 24:14.411
Someone who can undermine
the enemy from inside?

24:14.494 --> 24:15.829
How?

24:15.912 --> 24:18.832
By giving them
exactly what they want.

24:18.915 --> 24:22.335
Let them build their case on
Ernest's "eyewitness testimony."

24:22.419 --> 24:25.005
And then,
when he takes the stand,

24:25.088 --> 24:26.840
he can become a witness
for the defense.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.842
Our witness.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.011
It'll unravel the D.A.'s case
and embarrass Virgil in front

24:31.094 --> 24:32.387
of the entire city.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.015
Embarrass Virgil?

24:35.098 --> 24:36.558
I don't want to embarrass him,

24:36.641 --> 24:39.394
I want him to pay
for what he's done!

24:39.477 --> 24:42.814
Maybe we should talk
about this in private.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.904
It was your idea
to move the Agape here.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.780
It's your responsibility
to protect it.

24:50.864 --> 24:53.074
That's what I'm trying to do.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.702
How did you even file the
paperwork at the clerk's office?

24:55.785 --> 24:56.912
I never signed the deed.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.581
No, you didn't.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.586
You forged my signature?

25:04.669 --> 25:05.670
You refused to see
it was necessary.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.589
So you tried to steal the house
out from under me?

25:07.672 --> 25:08.924
We didn't try to steal
the house from under...

25:09.007 --> 25:11.885
"We"?

25:11.968 --> 25:14.429
I know you, you wouldn't try
and do this by yourself.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.432
The Magus and I saw
the need to...

25:17.515 --> 25:19.893
- Fuck me over.
- To do what we had to, to fend off

25:19.976 --> 25:21.895
that monster.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.064
You have no idea what it's like

25:24.147 --> 25:26.066
- to live with this...
- I don't care.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.820
You don't care?

25:30.904 --> 25:33.573
You lied to me, Susan.
You forged my signature.

25:33.657 --> 25:34.908
- What else are you willing to do?
- Oh, you're hardly one

25:34.991 --> 25:36.076
to talk about forgery.

25:36.159 --> 25:36.910
What does that mean?

25:36.993 --> 25:38.662
I've seen chemical burns
on your body

25:38.745 --> 25:40.622
for as long as I've known you.

25:40.705 --> 25:43.500
You can conjure fire
out of thin air, but an angel?

25:45.001 --> 25:46.962
Now you're actually starting
to think you're invincible.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.839
- Go on, keep digging.
- Ernest is a ticking time bomb.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.841
What's he gonna do when he
finds out you tricked him?

25:51.925 --> 25:54.469
You're talking months
before a trial. And after?

25:54.552 --> 25:56.805
I-I mean, how long
are you gonna keep this lie up?

25:56.888 --> 25:58.598
It's not a lie.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.601
This is our faith.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.437
If you abuse it, Virgil
won't have to come after us.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.438
It'll fall apart on its own.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.940
Even if the angel wasn't real,

26:07.023 --> 26:08.775
a man was determined to kill me,

26:08.858 --> 26:10.777
and now
he's my faithful servant.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.697
If that's not miraculous,
then what is?

26:13.780 --> 26:15.865
Is that really what you believe?

26:15.949 --> 26:17.826
Yes.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.662
I believe.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.539
Do you?

26:38.305 --> 26:39.806
What is all this, Rich?

26:39.889 --> 26:41.433
Don't-don't touch it.
I'm nearly finished.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.689
What are you doing?

26:47.772 --> 26:50.525
It's just my Benzedrine tablet.
Works faster this way.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.778
Not him, too.

26:53.862 --> 26:57.866
Yesterday, Marisol and I
officially broke up.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.368
Oh, Rich, I'm sorry.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.537
No, no, no. It's good.
It's-it's great, actually.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.707
It taught me
a very valuable life lesson.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.542
I waited too long
to pop the question,

27:07.625 --> 27:09.586
and then I waited too long
to try to make things right.

27:09.669 --> 27:12.505
You got to strike while the
iron's hot. Check that out.

27:12.589 --> 27:15.216
What is it?

27:15.300 --> 27:16.718
Well, this whole time,
we've been trying

27:16.801 --> 27:18.261
to compete with the Nazis,

27:18.345 --> 27:20.096
- but we need to be the Nazis.
- What?

27:20.180 --> 27:22.265
I mean, we need our own
secured testing facility,

27:22.349 --> 27:24.100
like Peenemunde,

27:24.184 --> 27:28.271
fully dedicated to our primary
objective, with real resources.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.899
Wind tunnels, launch pads,
expert staff.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.734
I-It's all ready
to present to Braxton.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.277
We've only had one test,

27:34.361 --> 27:35.445
and you want to ask
for more money?

27:35.528 --> 27:36.738
Not just more money,

27:36.821 --> 27:39.199
an ungodly amount of money.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.909
You're always saying
I need to think bigger.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.620
Well, we need to make
this project so big,

27:43.703 --> 27:45.789
that we become permanent,
and t-they can't just

27:45.872 --> 27:48.375
get rid of us because
they change their mind,

27:48.458 --> 27:51.628
or-or they, they suddenly decide
they don't need us anymore.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.630
This facility will
take years to build.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.216
This war will be over
before we pour the foundation.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.884
That's not what
he's getting at.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.762
It's not just about
winning this war,

28:00.845 --> 28:03.765
it's about winning
every war to come.

28:03.848 --> 28:07.394
When we can build a missile
that can cross the ocean,

28:07.477 --> 28:09.562
we'll be able to fight a war
without ever having to put

28:09.646 --> 28:11.606
a single soldier
on the battlefield.

28:11.689 --> 28:14.275
And when we build missiles
that cross oceans,

28:14.359 --> 28:16.277
we're one step closer
to building a rocket

28:16.361 --> 28:17.529
that can reach the moon.

28:17.612 --> 28:19.656
But this figure's a lie.

28:19.739 --> 28:21.449
You're just making things up.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.495
It's not a lie if it's going
to come true eventually.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.675
- Hey, Connie, can you cover me?
- Yeah.

28:38.758 --> 28:41.636
I'm gonna take my lunch.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.181
Mattie.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.560
Look at you,
a soldier.

28:57.610 --> 29:00.238
Please, I'm shipping
out in a few weeks.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.532
All I want is for you two
to at least talk to each other.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.869
So do you know where
they're sending you?

29:05.952 --> 29:09.622
No. But even if I did,
I couldn't tell anybody.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.249
One of his commanders
said it's Europe.

29:11.332 --> 29:12.876
Papá...

29:12.959 --> 29:14.461
Might make or break the war.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.337
Papá, I told you
not to tell anybody.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.840
It's okay. I can keep a secret.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.301
Richard wasn't supposed to talk
about his work, either,

29:21.384 --> 29:23.678
but he hated
keeping things from me.

29:23.761 --> 29:25.972
Ah, the gringo.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.515
How is he?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.517
No ring on
your finger.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.352
Did he get cold
feet, or did you?

29:31.436 --> 29:33.521
Papá...

29:33.605 --> 29:36.524
Probably better
it didn't work out.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.986
Can't say I saw you two
living happily ever after.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.573
- Mari, let's not...
- You should be grateful

29:43.656 --> 29:45.366
Mom was so devout.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.035
It's the only reason
she forgave you.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.038
Hey, I'm no saint.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.423
Come on, Mari.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.091
Cancer killed Mom.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.054
I wish I never told her.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.599
Finally, you admit it.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.768
Some secrets are
better kept.

30:11.851 --> 30:14.771
The mistake was you sleeping
around in the first place.

30:14.854 --> 30:16.898
You're judging me?

30:16.981 --> 30:18.858
God knows what you've been doing
all this time.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.777
An actress shacking up
with gringos.

30:24.697 --> 30:26.658
I'm not proud of what I did...

30:27.992 --> 30:30.578
...but at least
I was there at the end

30:30.662 --> 30:33.581
to hold her hand.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.333
Unlike you.

30:35.416 --> 30:40.922
You... just ran away,

30:41.005 --> 30:43.049
like a spoiled girl.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.974
<i>Te amo,</i> Matias.

30:51.057 --> 30:54.769
Wherever you're going,
I'll pray for your protection.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.981
Fine.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.901
Keep running away.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.987
See where that gets you.

31:11.077 --> 31:13.454
Now you see why I left?

31:13.538 --> 31:14.956
How could I ever forgive him?

31:15.039 --> 31:17.584
Are you sure he's the one
you need to forgive?

31:20.712 --> 31:22.338
General Braxton.

31:22.422 --> 31:25.008
- Jack.
- I'd like you to take a long, hard look

31:25.091 --> 31:28.052
and tell me if you see a
problem with this picture.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.140
You're the scientist.
You tell me.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.808
What you're looking
at represents

31:33.891 --> 31:36.477
the entirety of the
American missile program,

31:36.561 --> 31:39.022
overseen by these three men
from a small back room

31:39.105 --> 31:40.940
in a midsized factory.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.610
One could extrapolate from all
of this that the U.S. Military

31:43.693 --> 31:46.029
isn't taking this endeavor with
the same degree of seriousness

31:46.112 --> 31:47.822
as our enemy.

31:47.905 --> 31:50.158
That is how we
compete for real.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.784
This war may be
nearing its endgame,

31:51.868 --> 31:56.831
but the arms race
is just beginning.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.544
You really think your missiles
could eventually hit Tokyo?

32:01.628 --> 32:05.089
It's the nature of all
technology to improve.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.717
Just compare the Model T
to what we drive today.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.180
What you're proposing
is way beyond anything

32:12.263 --> 32:13.890
we've ever talked about.

32:13.973 --> 32:16.184
We know.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.936
If I run it
up the chain of command,

32:19.020 --> 32:20.521
big picture,
what's it gonna cost?

32:20.605 --> 32:22.523
Three million dollars, sir.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.400
And we already have
a name for it:

32:24.484 --> 32:26.986
JPL.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.989
J-Jack Parsons Laboratory?

32:30.073 --> 32:32.492
Jesus. You got balls.

32:32.575 --> 32:35.703
It stands for Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, sir.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.706
Don't think of this as a line
item for winning this war.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.669
Think of it as a down payment
on the future of this country.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.593
I finally figured out
how you get people to buy into

32:50.677 --> 32:54.055
every crazy idea
that comes into your head.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.557
You just say it like you actually believe it's true.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.101
Now you're catching on.

32:58.184 --> 33:01.020
After what, 20 years only?

33:01.104 --> 33:03.564
Would you look at that?

33:06.693 --> 33:10.655
Looks like you're manifesting
all sorts of things today.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.966
Were you waiting long?

33:30.049 --> 33:32.593
Not long.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.098
I want you to know
I didn't run off because of you.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.600
I ran away because of me.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.563
That sounds like a lie.

33:43.646 --> 33:47.275
Marriage, Richie.
That's the lie.

33:54.198 --> 33:58.619
When I was young,
I had a best friend, Lala.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.789
Our families spent
every weekend together.

34:01.873 --> 34:07.044
Then, one day, Lala and I came
home from school early,

34:07.128 --> 34:12.300
and we caught my father
and her mother in bed.

34:13.592 --> 34:16.596
Lala kept it
a secret,

34:16.679 --> 34:20.600
pretending she hadn't
seen anything.

34:20.683 --> 34:24.728
But I told my mother.

34:24.812 --> 34:28.149
And you know what she did?

34:28.232 --> 34:30.735
Nothing.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.155
She stayed
with Papá.

34:34.237 --> 34:35.697
But she swallowed her anger

34:35.782 --> 34:38.701
until it became a cancer
inside of her.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.331
Now do you understand?

34:43.414 --> 34:47.210
If you're worried about me
becoming your father,

34:47.293 --> 34:50.129
- I promise you that...
- I'm not, Richie.

34:50.213 --> 34:53.882
I'm worried about
me becoming him.

34:55.635 --> 34:59.263
Being married to someone
who loves you so much

34:59.347 --> 35:02.683
they'd let you get away
with anything...

35:04.811 --> 35:06.813
I couldn't do that to you.

35:06.896 --> 35:11.234
Then what if
we didn't get married?

35:11.317 --> 35:13.861
I only proposed because
it seemed sensible,

35:13.945 --> 35:18.908
but you and I have
never made sense.

35:18.991 --> 35:21.786
We don't have to do this
the way other people do it.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.913
We can do it however we want.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.957
Invent our own rules.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.126
Jack's starting to get to you.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.920
Maybe that's
a good thing.

35:31.003 --> 35:33.673
Let's not
get carried away, Richie.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.426
Okay, maybe not.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.264
Perhaps we can start with this.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.434
How would you feel
about staying the night?

36:28.853 --> 36:31.898
I'm-I'm
almost done.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.358
Is this all meant
to earn our forgiveness?

36:38.988 --> 36:40.990
Do you have any idea
what that man

36:41.073 --> 36:43.075
you conspired with
did to me and my sister?

36:47.413 --> 36:50.917
He took something from us
that we can never get back.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.797
I-I... I'm so sorry.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.549
It's not good enough.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.219
You want to atone?

37:02.303 --> 37:04.430
You won't do it by keeping up
the bargain you made with him.

37:04.513 --> 37:07.141
What would you
have me do instead?

37:07.224 --> 37:10.102
I want you to teach him
about shame.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.035
It's a big ask.

37:26.118 --> 37:28.162
I'm gonna have to take this
to the top.

37:28.245 --> 37:29.789
I'm glad you're intrigued, sir.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.666
Can you imagine combining this

37:31.749 --> 37:33.501
with the work
that we're doing in Los Alamos?

37:33.584 --> 37:36.671
Well, let me think about it.
Give me a few days.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.172
Till then,
those boys should hold tight.

37:38.255 --> 37:39.840
I'll let Mr. Parsons
and his team know.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.845
- You have a moment, General?
- Sure.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.347
Come in.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.974
Was that Marshall on the phone?

37:48.057 --> 37:50.810
I spoke with him earlier
when I caught wind

37:50.893 --> 37:53.312
of this new proposal.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.523
And I have informed him
of my misgivings.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.693
What misgivings?

37:58.776 --> 38:00.569
The man who wishes
to run the future

38:00.653 --> 38:02.738
of America's missile program
is the same man

38:02.822 --> 38:04.949
who wrote this.

38:08.911 --> 38:11.414
You had one of my MPs
doing your dirty work.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.708
I had to see what was happening
inside Mr. Parson's head.

38:13.791 --> 38:17.670
Dabbling with the occult
is one thing, General.

38:17.753 --> 38:19.463
But lying to us...

38:23.300 --> 38:26.887
M. Therion is an alias
for Aleister Crowley.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.724
Parsons has been in touch
with the very man

38:29.807 --> 38:31.559
he claims he's never met.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.227
A man with known
German contacts

38:33.310 --> 38:34.854
and an unknown agenda.

38:34.937 --> 38:37.231
You still think Parsons is
working for the other side.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.651
I just think he's working
someone other than us.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.754
It's strange.

38:59.837 --> 39:03.299
You were so clear when
we first met. Now you seem lost.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.926
Even to yourself.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.429
Must be the angel.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.765
It shattered me
and now

39:10.848 --> 39:12.933
- I'm being reformed.
- Do you know why

39:13.017 --> 39:15.936
Frater E.D. is attempting
to summon this angel?

39:17.188 --> 39:19.190
He wants to cross the Abyss.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.943
I'm not as ignorant
as you think.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.445
But do you know

39:24.528 --> 39:27.448
what "crossing the Abyss"
involves, or...

39:27.531 --> 39:29.325
even means?

39:32.745 --> 39:35.247
Crossing the Abyss...

39:37.208 --> 39:40.795
...is our most perilous working.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.713
It requires...

39:42.797 --> 39:43.923
shedding...

39:44.006 --> 39:46.634
of all earthly attachments.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.637
Love... wealth...

39:49.720 --> 39:51.180
desire...

39:51.263 --> 39:53.057
...fear.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.185
In order...

39:56.268 --> 39:57.978
to be one with
the divine.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.980
How do you do it?

40:00.064 --> 40:02.483
First, you...

40:02.566 --> 40:04.819
purify yourself by atoning

40:04.902 --> 40:07.238
for any pain
you've caused others.

40:09.281 --> 40:10.950
Then you take the oath.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.996
That sets you on a path...

40:16.080 --> 40:18.624
from which
there is no turning back.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.670
Frater E.D.
may believe

40:22.753 --> 40:24.797
he has met his angel.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.009
But if there were...

40:29.093 --> 40:31.178
a trace of
falsehood...

40:33.097 --> 40:36.642
...the outcome
would be tragic.

40:42.231 --> 40:44.525
Come, brother.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.862
Now is the
time to admit

40:47.945 --> 40:50.531
you are no more
a conjurer of angels

40:50.614 --> 40:53.909
than I am a man of science.

40:55.327 --> 40:57.830
You don't think I can be both?

40:57.913 --> 41:00.040
Maybe.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.710
After years of devoted study.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.879
But not the man before me now.

41:04.962 --> 41:08.215
You lack...
the discipline.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.675
Are you sure you should be
second-guessing

41:09.758 --> 41:11.093
the man keeping a roof
over your head?

41:11.177 --> 41:15.055
The only reason I haven't
second-guessed you

41:15.139 --> 41:17.183
in front
of the entire congregation

41:17.266 --> 41:20.186
is out of respect
for what you've given us.

41:20.269 --> 41:22.855
You conspired with my wife

41:22.938 --> 41:25.024
to steal my house
out from under me.

41:25.107 --> 41:27.568
Was that out of respect, too?

41:27.651 --> 41:30.196
I did not conspire,
I merely followed through

41:30.279 --> 41:32.740
on what was promised:
that this would become

41:32.823 --> 41:35.117
our house.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.912
If the circumstances
don't agree with you,

41:37.995 --> 41:40.873
you don't have to stay.

41:40.956 --> 41:43.083
You're scared,
aren't you?

41:43.167 --> 41:45.085
Scared that
if you leave,

41:45.169 --> 41:46.754
the others
would rather stay here

41:46.837 --> 41:48.964
- than follow you.
- They will follow me.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.219
Once they learn the truth.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.275
Mr. Byrne?

42:08.359 --> 42:10.736
- Hmm?
- I better head out

42:10.819 --> 42:12.112
if I want to get dinner on.

42:12.196 --> 42:15.616
Well, if you must.
Good night.

42:15.699 --> 42:17.743
Good night, sir.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.300
What, you forget
something, Gertie?

42:39.723 --> 42:42.351
You're early.

42:42.434 --> 42:46.146
The D.A. isn't meant
to be here until 10:00.

42:48.732 --> 42:51.443
Uh, well,
it's just as well.

42:52.903 --> 42:54.822
Gives us a chance to...

42:54.905 --> 42:57.199
go over just what exactly
you're gonna tell him.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.286
So did you bring
some kind of evidence?

43:16.927 --> 43:19.555
What are you doing?

43:27.813 --> 43:29.231
Uh...

45:35.065 --> 45:37.025
Patty.

45:41.905 --> 45:43.949
Go wake the believers.

45:50.122 --> 45:51.457
What if someone
catches us?

45:51.540 --> 45:53.083
Do what thou wilt,
Sister.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.839
"...even as we are now
physically bound

45:58.922 --> 46:00.174
unto the cross
of suffering..."

46:00.257 --> 46:02.301
"Even as we are
now physically bound

46:02.384 --> 46:03.552
unto the cross
of suffering..."

46:03.635 --> 46:05.471
"That I will lead
a pure life

46:05.554 --> 46:07.639
as a devoted servant
of the Order."

46:07.723 --> 46:09.183
"That I will lead a pure life

46:09.266 --> 46:10.851
as a devoted servant
of the Order."

46:10.934 --> 46:12.519
"That I will work
without attachment."

46:12.603 --> 46:14.855
"That I will work
without attachment."

46:14.938 --> 46:16.356
"That I will work
in truth."

46:16.440 --> 46:17.524
"That I will
work in truth."

46:17.608 --> 46:20.194
"That I will rely
only upon myself."

46:20.277 --> 46:22.029
"That I will rely
only upon myself."

46:22.112 --> 46:23.363
"That I will interpret

46:23.447 --> 46:26.033
"every phenomenon
as a particular dealing

46:26.116 --> 46:27.326
of God with my soul."

46:27.409 --> 46:29.036
"That I will interpret
every phenomenon

46:29.119 --> 46:31.371
as a particular dealing
of God with my soul."

46:31.455 --> 46:32.873
"And if I fail,

46:32.956 --> 46:34.875
<i>"herein may my pyramid
be profaned</i>

46:34.958 --> 46:36.543
<i>and the Eye closed upon me."</i>

46:36.627 --> 46:38.545
<i>"And if I fail,</i>

46:38.629 --> 46:42.424
<i>"herein may my pyramid
be profaned</i>

46:42.508 --> 46:44.218
<i>and the Eye closed to me."</i>

47:03.320 --> 47:04.571
Ah, please.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.406
Call the police.

47:10.285 --> 47:12.788
Uh, I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

47:20.629 --> 47:23.257
Wait.

47:24.841 --> 47:26.843
Come back!

47:27.970 --> 47:28.971
Come back!

47:31.984 --> 47:36.984
