00:01.127 --> 00:03.963
- Well, I do have
this Neanderthal jaw here,

00:04.088 --> 00:05.423
so I'm gonna go with I'm a six.

00:05.548 --> 00:07.216
- Well, you're too skinny.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.759
I think you could be a seven
if you weren't so skinny,

00:08.884 --> 00:10.177
'cause, like,
girls love a little squish.

00:10.303 --> 00:12.013
Reminds 'em of their dads.
- Yeah.

00:12.138 --> 00:13.598
- You know? And all girls
want to bang their dads.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.266
But they can't
because of laws and stuff.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.101
- I'm an 11,
'cause I got a 6 up here

00:17.226 --> 00:18.227
and a 5-inch pork sword,
so...

00:18.352 --> 00:19.353
- Oh.
[laughter]

00:19.478 --> 00:20.646
- Oh! Hey, hey!

00:20.771 --> 00:21.772
[horn honks]
- Get out of the way!

00:21.897 --> 00:23.357
- Let's go, Babak.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.068
- We're trying
to get some doughnuts, man!

00:26.193 --> 00:27.862
- [laughs]
Ooh, they feisty today.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.656
- Hey, get this hoopty
off my court.

00:30.781 --> 00:34.118
- Are you telling me
you condone of this? And that?

00:34.243 --> 00:35.703
- Yeah, well,
corporate's been bugging me

00:35.828 --> 00:37.455
to start a "health initiative."

00:37.580 --> 00:39.332
So instead of running
some stupid 5K,

00:39.457 --> 00:41.292
which would kill
half of these slobs,

00:41.417 --> 00:43.336
we're having
a 3-on-3 tournament.

00:43.461 --> 00:44.587
- Oh, very cool.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.130
I did not know
you balled, Alice.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.715
- Yeah, well, it's in my blood.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.300
My dad worked for
the Chicago Bulls growing up.

00:49.425 --> 00:50.635
- Oh, my gosh. That would be,
like, a dream gig.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.762
- Did he party
with B.J. Armstrong?

00:52.887 --> 00:54.972
- Did he and B.J., like, get BJs
together in the locker room?

00:55.097 --> 00:56.641
That'd be cool, right?
- [laughs] Yeah.

00:56.766 --> 00:59.435
- Are you asking me
if my dad got a blow job

00:59.560 --> 01:00.686
next to an NBA player
in a bathroom

01:00.811 --> 01:02.563
and then told me about it?

01:02.688 --> 01:05.316
- Oh, it's inappropriate?
- Yeah, a little bit.

01:05.441 --> 01:06.901
- Oh, sorry. There's different
social standards

01:07.026 --> 01:08.069
in different situations.
- Yeah.

01:08.194 --> 01:09.820
- Ew.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.614
Anyway, I did get corporate
to put up a cool-ass prize.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.200
[clicks tongue]
- Cool.

01:14.325 --> 01:18.704
- Oh! Oh! Is that a Dodge Dart?
Oh! [laughs]

01:18.829 --> 01:21.207
I freakin' love Dodge Darts.
- Great safety ratings.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.709
- That is my favorite car-
I'm asking for that

01:23.834 --> 01:25.336
for, like, the next six
Christmases from my parents.

01:25.461 --> 01:28.339
- No. No, no, no,
you don't win the car.

01:28.464 --> 01:30.091
No, that's the company car.

01:30.216 --> 01:34.053
But you do get to drive it
for a two-day, one-night stay

01:34.178 --> 01:36.889
atone
of the TAC timeshares in Reno!

01:37.014 --> 01:38.099
- So we do get to drive
the Dodge Dart.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.475
- Yeah.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.018
- So we do get to be
in the Dodge Dart.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.144
- To the big dirty, baby.
- To Reno, to Reno.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.521
I think Reno is the new Vegas.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.564
Instead of, like,
being the Rat Pack,

01:45.690 --> 01:47.441
we could be, like,
the Frat Pack, dude.

01:47.566 --> 01:48.984
I call Seth Rogen.
- I'll be any Wilson brother.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.695

Waymond, Bill, and Babak

01:50.820 --> 01:51.987

01:52.113 --> 01:54.657
- Oh. Couple of losers!
Where they at?

01:54.782 --> 01:56.659

who the hell's that?

03:18.157 --> 03:19.784
- Oh, that's Lynette
from accounting.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.661
- Nothing but Lynette!

03:22.787 --> 03:24.455
- Yeah, she almost
made the '96 Olympics,

03:24.580 --> 03:27.416
until Cheryl Miller posterized
her in the exhibition game.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.460
Yeah, she ended up
on a Wheaties box.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.962
Ugh, it was brutal.
Muff all in her face.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.548

of female basketball.

Do you think-do you think maybe
we could get an autograph?

- No, no, no.

to practice

03:58.948 --> 04:00.533
if we're gonna beat
Lynette and her squad.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.201
We need to figure out some
kind of, like, triangle offense.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.078
- [sighs]
- Or, even, hear me out,

04:04.203 --> 04:06.705
a circular kind of offense
or a rectangular one?

04:06.831 --> 04:08.207

'Cause we are jocks.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.683
and, like, maybe
have sex with hookers.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.518
- I want to have sex
with a hooker so bad.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.562
I won't pay, but if I meet one
and, like, we hit it off,

04:29.687 --> 04:30.688
I'll totally do it.

04:30.813 --> 04:33.107
- I will agree with Blake

04:33.232 --> 04:35.359

we don't need to practice.

- Yes.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.118
She's a big girl.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.870

- The Mexican kind,
so you know they're good.

and here is the juice shooters.

Those are not clean.

gonna say her titties.

smash her skull in

off Mexican steroids.

and I'm gonna piss her off,

06:32.309 --> 06:33.978

want to punch me, right?

that if you were just
a little bit better,

07:02.256 --> 07:03.257
maybe it'd be you hanging out
with Reggie Miller

07:08.095 --> 07:09.513
But all I could do
is go home to my kids

07:09.638 --> 07:11.181
and thank God
that they're healthy, you know?

07:11.306 --> 07:12.808
'Cause they wasn't always
healthy, you know?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.852
You remember little Darnell?
Almost lost his leg.

07:14.977 --> 07:18.605
- Okay.
All right, well,

07:18.731 --> 07:20.691
I hope little Darnell dies.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.484
- What?
What the fuck?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.111
- What are you doing?
- Oh!

07:24.236 --> 07:25.571
- What the hell?

07:25.696 --> 07:26.947
- Oh, dude, seriously,
you are a dickhead!

07:27.072 --> 07:28.240
- Sorry. [chuckles]
- Oh, my God, Gil.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.908
Get some ice, Gil.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.035
Did you break it?
- I mean, I know it's broken.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.828
- How that feel? Oh!
- Ah!

07:32.953 --> 07:34.329
- You're not a doctor, dude.
- I was in the Boy Scouts.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.456
- Just 'cause
you're light-skinned,

07:35.581 --> 07:36.749
that don't make you a doctor.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.418
- Beneath the surface
of Azeroth,

07:39.543 --> 07:44.423
the old gods plot the spread
of manifest evil.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.800
In the icy tundras
of the northern realm,

07:46.925 --> 07:51.138
a spirit of pure malice

07:51.263 --> 07:52.556
commands an army of orcs.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.099
[spits]
Foul things.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.227
And yet in this lowly hovel,

07:57.352 --> 08:01.899
one of us has murder
in our hearts.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.321
- No! Ow! Ow!
Please don't kill me!

08:07.446 --> 08:09.239
Stop it! Ouch!

08:09.364 --> 08:12.159
- Oh! Oh! Oh, whoa, whoa.
[clears throat]

08:12.284 --> 08:13.452
Bumble Bee tuna,
Bumble Bee tuna.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.745
- What, dude?

08:14.870 --> 08:16.246
- [whispering]
Your balls are showing.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.706
- Oh.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.208
- Yeah, and butthole,
everything, whole gooch.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.086
- Sorry, bro.
- Sorry about that. Ah!

08:22.211 --> 08:24.379
Young Gazzbrook Goldcrank
is dead!

08:24.505 --> 08:28.217
And one of us is the murderer,
but who, hmm?

08:28.342 --> 08:29.760
LS it you?

08:29.885 --> 08:33.179
Ah, yes, you have the look
of murder in your eyes.

08:33.304 --> 08:37.976
Or is it the filthy blood elf
Saetharin Firewhisper?

08:38.102 --> 08:40.312
- Okay, I'm sorry. Blake, can we
get name tags or something?

08:40.437 --> 08:42.481
'Cause you just called that guy
"Seafart Firetruck."

08:42.606 --> 08:44.316
I'm never gonna remember that.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.196
[beatboxing]

08:49.321 --> 08:51.532
- Good morning, Dersy.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.785
- Time to grow strong,

08:54.910 --> 08:58.747
my weak, little friend.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.582
- Ow!
What are you doing?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.668
- I just injected you
with steroids!

09:02.793 --> 09:04.253
Oh, my God, do you feel it?

09:04.378 --> 09:07.464
Do you feel it
coursing through your bod?

09:07.589 --> 09:08.674
- Dude, let me out of here
right now.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.342
- Oh, nuh-uh.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.511
No, you got to think of someone
bigger than yourself.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.764
Spiritual awakening,
bigger than thyself.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.683
Such is Reno, man.
- What?

09:17.808 --> 09:22.688
- Feel the steroids
coursing through your body,

09:22.813 --> 09:25.566
making your veins pop...
- Get-

09:25.691 --> 09:28.777
- Like the veins
within a man's penis.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.362
- Okay, get off of me
right now.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.697
Get off of me!

09:31.822 --> 09:34.616
- Feel the power.
Feel the strength.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.619
Feel. . .the...

09:37.744 --> 09:39.746
Mexican.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.376
- I feel it.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.502
<i>_</i> Really?

09:45.627 --> 09:47.045
Wow, they work quick, huh?

09:47.171 --> 09:48.714
Frickin' hits you
just like that.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.425
- I feel it!
- Yeah, boy!

09:51.550 --> 09:53.177
- Well, the ice princess here
is-

09:53.302 --> 09:55.012
- He's right here.
He's not even in his room.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.138
What are you doing? What's
everyone still doing here, man?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.431
We got a b-ball game!

09:57.556 --> 09:59.308
- But I have to finish
this game first.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.434
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, it's going on 14 hours.

10:00.559 --> 10:01.977
Oh, my gosh, nonstop.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.395
- Hate to tell you
your World of 'Warcrap" game

10:03.520 --> 10:05.606
is over!
- Okay.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.649
- The mystery's solved.
The murderers are here.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.526
DeMamp,
let's slit some throats!

10:09.651 --> 10:11.486
- Yeah! Murder 'em!
Kill 'em all!

10:11.612 --> 10:13.155
Hell, yeah!
[grunts]

10:13.280 --> 10:15.282
Death!
- What are you doing?

10:15.407 --> 10:19.536
- Just kickin' it right now
in the 'roid lounge, chillin'.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.788
About ready to inject myself,
get the blood pumping!

10:21.914 --> 10:23.415
- You just did steroids.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.459
- Right down my D-hole!
Dahh!

10:25.584 --> 10:26.835
Just kidding.
That would hurt.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.545
I'm gonna go
in my heart, though.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.214
Fuck!

10:30.339 --> 10:31.632
- Okay, fine.
I'll get it started!

10:31.757 --> 10:33.050
I'm getting it started!
Whoo!

10:33.175 --> 10:34.593
- Wait.
- This is fun! Let's go.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.803
- No, no.
- You're dead. You're dead!

10:36.929 --> 10:38.347
Murdered! Let's go, dude!
- Don't go anywhere.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.307
- Get out of here!
- What is your problem, man?

10:40.432 --> 10:42.392
- You're gonna sit here
and eyeball me, man?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.728
- You think I'm afraid of you?
- I know you are, nut-muncher.

10:44.853 --> 10:48.899
- I am Balkaran Hellscream,
Warchief of the Horde, and...

10:49.024 --> 10:51.235
you are a mere human.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.780
- Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

10:54.905 --> 10:56.281
No, no, no, don't go!
Oh, no!

10:56.406 --> 10:58.283
- I want everybody out
and off my land, now!

10:58.408 --> 10:59.701
- I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.371
- You are out of the guild,
Kashakazul.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.749
You're now banished
to be known simply

11:05.874 --> 11:08.627
as Blake Henderson.
- No, no, no.

11:08.752 --> 11:09.878
- Hey, Jeremy?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.130
Can your stepmom
give me a ride?

11:12.256 --> 11:13.757
- What the hell
are you doing, man?

11:13.882 --> 11:15.592
You know how long it took me
to get in that guild?

11:15.717 --> 11:17.594
- No, I don't know.
But you're welcome, okay?

11:17.719 --> 11:19.888
Because the guild's fake,
this team is real,

11:20.013 --> 11:21.932
and we need you.
- Okay. You need me?

11:22.057 --> 11:23.183
- Yes.
- Well, guess what.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.601
- What?
- I quit!

11:24.726 --> 11:26.186
- If you quit this team,

11:26.311 --> 11:28.230
I'm never gonna
forgive you, Blake.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.940
I swear
on my mother's only child,

11:30.065 --> 11:32.109
which is who I am,
I'll never forgive you.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.652
- You know what? I'm gonna make
this a little more interesting.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.280
- Please do.
- I'm joining Tez's team.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.990
Yeah.
- You're what?

11:38.115 --> 11:39.658
- Yeah, that's right.
And we're going to Reno.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.993
You hear that, Adam?

11:41.118 --> 11:42.786
- I'm having chest pains.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.621
- I got to go to AMPM,
all right?

11:44.746 --> 11:46.290
I need a Slurpee to cool off.
- Hey, hey!

11:46.415 --> 11:49.042
- Ah, my chest hurts!
- It's A.M.P.M.!

11:49.167 --> 11:50.502
He's out of his mind.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.170
I think he's literally
lost his mind.

11:52.296 --> 11:53.630
- I can't even move my left arm.
- What? Are you serious?

11:53.755 --> 11:55.299
- Ahh! I think I'm having
a heart attack.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.883
- You're shooting this stuff
right in your chest.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.343
You're crazy.
- We need to do more steroids.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.095
Inject me with more steroids
to offset it.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.097
- You're done with steroids.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.473
- It's like <i>Pulp</i> Fiction.
I need to inject more into me.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.225
- I'm not injecting
more steroids.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.060
I'm gonna take you to
a hospital or something, okay?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.228
- There's not enough time, man!
You got to get to the game!

12:08.353 --> 12:09.855
- Forget about the game.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.148
We don't even have
enough players for a team.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.734
- Well, then you get
some players.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.737
And you get a team together,
and you dunk that ball so hard,

12:16.862 --> 12:19.740
either using a mini trampoline
or some moon shoes,

12:19.865 --> 12:21.241
and shatter the backboard
so hard

12:21.366 --> 12:23.285
that it gets glass
in someone's eye!

12:23.410 --> 12:24.703
- I promise.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.079
We got Reno.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.497
- It's a deal.
- All right, deal.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.124
That was a close call.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.959
[laughing]

12:31.084 --> 12:32.419
- Are you gonna call
an ambulance?

12:32.544 --> 12:33.754
- Oh, are you still
heart-attacking?

12:33.879 --> 12:34.963
- Yeah, I'm still having
a heart attack.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.089
- Is that still happening?
- Yeah.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.215
- Okay, I am sorry.
- Yeah.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.301
[beatboxing]

12:42.346 --> 12:44.431
- [sighs]
Thank you for joining me, Karl.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.058
Do not make me
regret this.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.726
- No, absolutely not.
Hey, how's Adam doing?

12:47.851 --> 12:48.935
Is he okay?

12:49.061 --> 12:50.604
- Adam's not good, Karl.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.022
Adam almost died.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.273
He had a bunch
of your Mexican steroids

12:53.398 --> 12:54.733
and then had himself
a heart attack.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.068
- That guy eats horribly, man.
Too much sodium.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.486
He needs to lay off
the Sun Chips.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.071
- And I said I'd win this game
for him,

12:59.196 --> 13:00.447
and I don't know
if he's gonna pull through.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.865
But what's up
with your boy, man?

13:01.990 --> 13:03.116
He's not that big.
Is he good?

13:03.241 --> 13:04.368
- Oh, yeah, man.
He's great.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.078
- Please.
- Yeah, for real.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.662
Plus, he's the only guy
that we could afford.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.082
- Where my 100 at, bro?
- Where his 100 at, bro?

13:10.207 --> 13:11.625
- Where's his 100-

13:11.750 --> 13:13.168
[sighs]

13:13.293 --> 13:14.795
Lucky I just stopped
at the ATM.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.213
100 bucks. There you go.
- Thank you.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.672
- Here's the deal.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.758
Anyone asks,
you are a night janitor here.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.176
- Okay.
- You got to wear that.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.469
It kind of smells,
I'm sorry, but...

13:22.594 --> 13:24.471
- Oh, man.
Make that 300.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.680
300, please.
- Oh, my God!

13:25.806 --> 13:27.057
Are you kidding me?

13:27.182 --> 13:28.183
It's for Reno.
There you go, man.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.810
- This is only 200.

13:29.935 --> 13:30.936
- Yeah, that's 200,
100's in your pocket.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.104
That's 300, okay?
Come on.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.440
[slow jam]

13:35.565 --> 13:37.234
Oh, baby!

13:37.359 --> 13:39.069
The Trilla Squad
has arrived,

13:39.194 --> 13:40.779
and its captain is me!

13:40.904 --> 13:43.281
You might know me
as Basketball Lecter.

13:43.407 --> 13:46.576
Over here,
we got Karl the Malone,

13:46.701 --> 13:50.247
and my main guy
G-orge the G-anitor!

13:50.372 --> 13:51.498
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

13:51.623 --> 13:52.916
That's a terrible-ass nickname.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.543
- What do you want to be called?
- Hot Sauce.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.877
- Hot Sauce.
He wants to be-

13:56.002 --> 13:57.045
what do you want me to be,
Parmesan?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.296
Come on.
- I'll be Heinz 57.

13:58.422 --> 13:59.631
- Okay.
- That's stupid.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.050
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.219
This tournament's for people
that work here only.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.221
- Yeah. Sorry. They're right.
Employees only.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.515
- This is the night janitor
at TAC,

14:08.640 --> 14:10.434
and this is Karl the plumber
from that one time.

14:10.559 --> 14:11.685
- Hi.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.270
- I'm sorry.
I just-

14:13.395 --> 14:14.729
- Don't like to interact

14:14.855 --> 14:16.356
with two of
your hardest-working employees

14:16.481 --> 14:18.275
that clean up after the slop
you leave behind

14:18.400 --> 14:19.860
in that sty
you call an office?

14:19.985 --> 14:22.279
Is that what's happening?
Well, guess what.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.406
I'm not gonna stand
for it anymore, okay?

14:24.531 --> 14:26.867
Guys, go warm up, all right?
I'm on your team.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.535
I'm fighting for you!
- Nice to meet you, Karl.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.412
- Come on, Hot Sauce, let's go.

I'll talk to you after the game.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.832
Thank you for your service.

Adam, huh?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.127
- Where's our best friend?

14:37.252 --> 14:39.045
Mm, he's in a hospital, Blake,

14:39.171 --> 14:41.256
because he has a broken heart
that you broke.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.924
- Okay, I know that's not true.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.259
You can't go to the hospital
for a broken heart.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.760
- Adam had
a heart attack, okay?

14:45.886 --> 14:47.137
And the doctor said
it's your fault

14:47.262 --> 14:49.014
and not
all the Mexican steroids.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.850
So if it's cool with you,
I'm gonna warm up now, man!

to the TAC file room,

14:55.228 --> 14:56.897

quite a shock.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.365

Alice's nipples taste like.
