00:29.795 --> 00:31.696
How I'm supposed to get sleep
knowing Olivia

00:31.697 --> 00:34.265
could've ratted us out to
Pezuela and gotten us green lit?

00:34.266 --> 00:37.435
Just because Olivia has been
Pezuela's eyes and ears

00:37.436 --> 00:39.538

passing along the intel

00:39.539 --> 00:41.873

this is organized crime
