(Fireworks boom and crackle)

01:24.840 --> 01:26.763
(Fireworks whistle)

01:48.400 --> 01:49.765
Hi, Mum.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.810
Sorry, I couldn't call sooner.
Haven't had the chance.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.925
No, I'm just walking back to the flat
My shift ran over.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.762
Loads of kids with firework burns.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.323
How's Dad?

02:23.760 --> 02:26.047
What about next weekend?

02:26.080 --> 02:28.401
I could take the train up, stay the night

02:29.600 --> 02:31.364
(Fireworks exploding)

02:39.720 --> 02:42.326
I'll call you on Sunday.
We'll make a plan.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.883
Gotta go now.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.927
OK. Bye.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.809
(Whispering)

02:59.600 --> 03:01.364
Go on, man.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.363
Hey, cut across her.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.251

03:18.560 --> 03:20.961
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

03:22.440 --> 03:25.330
The money, the purse.
Give me the purse, give it to me.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.005
Don't fuck about.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.963
Hey. Please.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.564
- Give me that ring.
- It's not worth...

03:31.600 --> 03:33.523
Shut up. Wanna get murked, innit?

03:38.160 --> 03:39.764
- Stupid...

03:40.480 --> 03:42.084

03:43.560 --> 03:46.723

03:46.760 --> 03:48.171
Fuck the feds, man.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.726
Fuck!

04:05.360 --> 04:08.330
- Oi, she's duckin'.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.446
- Allow it.
- Somebody's bombin' us, blood.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.881
- No, man, it's just a firework.
- Some big firework.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.962
Nice whip.
Could be bare valuables in there.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.811
Raargh!

04:38.840 --> 04:40.524
- Shit. There's something...
- Whoa!

04:40.560 --> 04:42.801
(Screeching and panicked shouting)

04:45.280 --> 04:46.486
(Screeches)

04:51.160 --> 04:52.889
What the fuck was that?

04:52.920 --> 04:55.571
Some orang-utan type thing,
I'm not even lying, bruv.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.444
Hey, it's breezin', man.
It looked like Dobby the house elf.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.881
- Moses got shanked by a Dobby.
- (Laughter)

05:02.080 --> 05:04.560
I'm chasing that down. I'm killing that.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.481
Watch.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.761
- Payback, fam.
- I'm proper stampin' that.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.644
- It's gone in adventure.
- Round two, bruv. Round two.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.523
Playtime, bruv.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.483
(Screeching)

05:17.360 --> 05:19.089
(Excited chatter)

05:19.120 --> 05:20.451
I got my tool.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.131
No man stunting.
I'm gonna fuck this thing up!

05:23.160 --> 05:24.810
Yo, you got beef now, Moses.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.084
- Yo, Pest, got them bangers?
- Yeah.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.724
Jam, man.

05:39.920 --> 05:40.887
(Bang)

05:40.920 --> 05:42.843
(Squealing)

05:43.400 --> 05:45.243
(Further bangs)

05:45.280 --> 05:46.406
(Squealing)

05:47.960 --> 05:49.371
It's mine.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.091
- (Creature screeches)
- Hey, back me! Back me!

05:55.080 --> 05:57.003
(Shouting and screeching)

06:02.040 --> 06:04.042
(Screeching dies down)

06:04.080 --> 06:08.529
- Ah, no, man, that is rank.
- Hey, we broke it up.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.643
- What is that, cuz?
- That ain't no is. That's a was.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.126
I told you, some exotic creature,
like a monkey thing.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.209
That fell out of the sky. You trying to
tell me it's raining monkeys?

06:17.240 --> 06:19.208
That ain't no monkey.
Monkeys ain't bald.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.766
No, that's some weird thing.
I don't know what that is.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.087
- I ain't even gonna say.
- You know what that is?

06:24.120 --> 06:27.044
I'll tell you what that is.
That's a alien, bruv. Believe it.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.765
It must have come from outer space,
trying to take over Earth.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.962
But it landed in the wrong place.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.923
- The wrong place!
- (Laughter)

06:33.960 --> 06:36.770
- Welcome to London, mo fucker.
- Welcome to the ends, brother.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.770
This is the block. And nobody fucks
with the block, do you get me?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.326
The B-L-O-C-K.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.284
ALL: Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap. Brap...

06:45.320 --> 06:47.243
(Brapping)

07:38.040 --> 07:39.963
(Sobbing)

07:43.000 --> 07:45.526
- You all right, love?
- Not really.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.565
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.887
- Come along, I'll take you home.
- Thank you.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.809
Come on.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.929
You poor thing.
Pale as a ghost, you were.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.440
Must have given you such a nasty shock.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.609
- You sure you don't want a cup of tea?
- No, thanks. Water's fine.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.967
(Fireworks crackle and boom)

08:05.000 --> 08:07.207
Bloody fireworks.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.531
I think they should ban them.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.769
Could be the third world war out there,
you wouldn't know the difference.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.723
What did the police say?

08:17.120 --> 08:21.364
Said it was one of the busiest nights
of the year. Bet they don't even turn up.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.050
Only it's not like the kids
are scared of 'em no more.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.448
Walking around with knives,
great big dogs, like they own the block.

08:28.480 --> 08:32.326
Excuse my French, but they're
fucking monsters, ain't they?

08:33.440 --> 08:35.647
Yeah. Fucking monsters.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.807
- ..its ribs and that.
- Have you found anything?

08:39.840 --> 08:41.443
(Laughter)

08:41.480 --> 08:44.086
I beg you give me two pound
to go to Chicken World, fam.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.571
That's disgusting.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.523
Moses,
where are we gonna take that thing?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.524
Take it to Ron's. He watches
that National Geographic shit.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.801
- (Mobile rings)
- All man ever does is blaze,

08:52.840 --> 08:55.127
water them big buds
and watch the nature channel.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.289
He'll identify that thing for real.
Let me bell him up.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.045
It was madness, fam.
The beast of Brixton.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.889
We were crazy kicking that.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.281
No, Mum. Playing football.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.891
Yeah, I had pepperoni pizza.
You gave me the money.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.605
Some kind of
non-found-out-about creature.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.404
Yeah, like Some Gears Of War thing.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.166
Yes, I know. Back by ten.
I swear, Mum, back by ten.

09:18.200 --> 09:22.046
Ah, she's a nurse.
They don't get paid nothing, fam.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.084
Oi, Moses. Why you always picking
the poor people, man?

09:26.720 --> 09:28.643
(Laughter)

09:30.800 --> 09:32.723
- Hey, let's walk, bruv.
- Whoo!

09:43.520 --> 09:45.010
Woy.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.651
- Moses, what happened to your face?
- Battled an alien that fell from the sky.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.330
- You're funny.
- Eurgh, what is that?

09:51.360 --> 09:52.964
I'm sorry, I can't even look at that.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.765
- Halloween was last week.
- That ain't real. That's a creation.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.564
- Touch it.
- Shove that thing in my face

09:57.600 --> 09:59.648
and them fangs are going up in your tits.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.604
- Move it from me. Grow up.
- Could be diseased, you get me?

10:02.680 --> 10:05.570
- I don't want no chlamydia.
- (Girls laugh)

10:05.600 --> 10:07.841
So you're telling me
that fell out of the sky?

10:07.880 --> 10:10.281
- Yeah.
- And did that to your face?

10:11.160 --> 10:13.447
- Yeah.
- So, you killed lt?

10:14.080 --> 10:15.241
Yeah.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.441
(Scoffs)

10:16.480 --> 10:18.130
Such a bad breed, Moses.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.763
- Fuck! It's alive!
- (Screaming)

10:23.200 --> 10:26.921
- Tia is moving to you, Moses.
- She's on your balls, cuz.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.361
Hey, that's my cousin
you're chatting about.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.687
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey, hey, watch this jump.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.290
Get down, man.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.681
- Trust, I can do it.
- Humpty-Dumpty.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.291
We ain't cleanin' your guts off the floor,
Biggz. Come on.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.648
- Oh, I swear I could do that.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you can, man.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.566
- Oi, Gavin, you pyro.
- My name ain't Gavin.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.404
It's Mayhem and he's Probs.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.125
- (Laughter)
- Probs and Mayhem? Seriously?

10:56.160 --> 10:58.640
- Urgh, what is that?
- That's none of your business.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.126
That's sick, man.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.969
Where you going?
Let us come with you.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.765
Yeah, Moses, let us roll with you.
We're bad boys.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.810
Go away. This is big man business.
You're too tiny.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.366
Yeah, get in touch
when you get your first pube.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.640
Go suck your mum.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.808
- Oooh!
- Whoo!

11:14.880 --> 11:16.803

11:49.760 --> 11:51.171
Hey, Dad.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.124
Yeah, just on my way to the cinema.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.486
Yes, I promise,
it'll be parked outside in the morning.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.443
OK, Dad. Gotta go. Bye-bye.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.330
I pressed it already. Taking 'nough time.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.283
(Sniggering)

12:19.560 --> 12:21.562
I'll... I'll just... I'll get the next one.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.401
Express elevator
to the penthouse suite.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.087
Do you remember
what they were wearing?

12:29.120 --> 12:32.169
One of them had one of those
woolly hats with those tassels.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.691
<i>The one that pushed me over,
the main one,</i>

12:35.720 --> 12:37.882
<i>had a black baseball cap
with a red brim.</i>

12:39.200 --> 12:40.929
<i>That's all l can remember.</i>

12:40.960 --> 12:43.850
<i>Did you see their faces?
Have you seen them around?</i>

12:43.880 --> 12:45.882
<i>No. They had hoods and scarves.</i>

12:45.920 --> 12:47.649
WOMAN: You want me to call the police?

12:47.680 --> 12:50.331
The best thing is to come with us
for a drive around the block,

12:50.360 --> 12:51.930
see if we can spot them.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.962
Then we can drop you
with a friend afterwards.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.331
No, thanks.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.364
I'm not gonna be scared out my own home
by a bunch of bloody teenagers.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.970
(Door buzzer)

13:00.000 --> 13:01.729
Yo, Ron!

13:03.160 --> 13:05.288
(Presses buzzer) Yo, Ron!

13:08.360 --> 13:09.441
All right?

13:10.520 --> 13:13.763
No idea. Not a bloody clue.

13:13.800 --> 13:18.761
Maybe there was a party at the zoo
and a monkey fucked a fish.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.203
I saw them with it on the way up.

13:22.240 --> 13:26.006
- Thought they'd won it at the funfair.
- Smells real though, don't it?

13:26.040 --> 13:27.963
Smells like a shit did a shit.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.571
- You wanna buy a bit of weed, then?
- Yeah.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.046
- Yeah, come on.
- (Chatter)

13:39.080 --> 13:41.048
Shut up, man.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.366
Well done, lads.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.051
You've discovered a species
hitherto unknown to science,

13:45.080 --> 13:49.369
quite possibly non-terrestrial in origin,
and you kicked its fucking head in.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.010
(Laughter)

13:51.840 --> 13:54.047
- Take a seat. I'll be back in a minute.
- Yeah.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.050
We're getting rich off that, you know,
cos we discovered it.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.407
- eBay, fam.
- Alert the media.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.283
Exclusive rights to the highest bidder.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.049
The Sun. Believes anything.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.163
No, no, no, no, no. The Sun'll dress it up
like one of them Page Three girls.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.804
You wanna call The Guardian, blood.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.049
- People will believe it in a proper paper.
- No, tabloids pay more money.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.282
You can't call the paper.
FBI will confiscate it.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.403
FBI? This is England, there ain't no FBI.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.363
It's Section Six or something.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.449
- We need an expert to verify that thing.
- Look in the Yellow Pages.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.802
Look for scientist people who know
about all them meteor things.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.161
Yellow Pages?
Like, what, "A" for aliens?

14:28.240 --> 14:29.810
- Cheers.
- We need a lawyer,

14:29.840 --> 14:31.285
a manager or something.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.402
Bell Simon Cowell. Alien's Got Talent.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.805
(Laughter)

14:36.640 --> 14:38.005
Jokes, man, jokes.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.844
Actually, I did this zoology module at uni.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.446
Primatology, mammalogy, all that shizzle.

14:47.480 --> 14:51.485
That thing in there don't belong
to no taxon I've ever studied.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.091
You met Brewis, then?
Very reliable customer.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.003

Let me keep that thing in the weed room.
Could be worth bare money.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.082
That's the safest place in the block.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.160
Look, I'd love to, but it's not my decision.
I only work here.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.123

30:12.000 --> 30:14.606
We're running for our lives now, cuz.
Believe!

30:16.800 --> 30:21.044
Jack a bully van, crash it into my whip
and then chat shit about aliens to me?

30:22.040 --> 30:25.761
This is making me nervous, blood.
That boy's still cuffed, you know.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.485
- Police are gonna be all over this.
- You trying to snake me?

30:33.600 --> 30:37.082
What, you wanna bring arms to me now?
You wanna murk me?

30:37.680 --> 30:42.083
- You wanna war with me?
- Listen to me, cuz, I'm not even lying.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.360
If we was making it up,

30:43.400 --> 30:45.971
don't you think we'd make up
something better than aliens?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.684
Say that word one more time.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.563
(Distant screeching)

30:49.600 --> 30:52.365
I told you, bruv.
On the roof, if you don't believe me.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.885
What? What's on the roof?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.331
- One of them...
- Say it!

30:55.360 --> 30:58.364
One of them big
gorilla-wolf motherfuckers.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.323
(Screeching)

31:01.560 --> 31:03.847
Yo, Hi-Hatz, there is something there, bruv.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.931
Yo, go see what that is.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.883
- No way, bruv.
- Move!

31:16.800 --> 31:18.404
Shit.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.451
Yo, Hi-Hatz, bruv.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.323
- There's no...
- Oh, shit!

31:48.200 --> 31:50.123
(Screeching and chomping)

31:53.120 --> 31:54.929
Oh, shit!

31:54.960 --> 31:57.088
- Got the key to your lockup?
- Yeah.

32:01.080 --> 32:04.527
- Follow me, follow me!
- (Panicked shouting)

32:04.840 --> 32:06.808
Moses! Pussyhole!

32:06.840 --> 32:08.922
I'm gonna get you killed, blood! Watch!

32:08.960 --> 32:10.883
(Screeching)

32:15.440 --> 32:17.169
I told you, man. Alien invasion.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.521
London-wide. For real.
I knew it from the start.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.011
Them vans got tracker beacons.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.168
- Police will be here any minute.
- We're fucked.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.567
When the feds find the bodies
and the van, we are fucked.

32:25.600 --> 32:29.241
No. If it's happening all over, the police
are gonna be too busy tonight.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.760
National emergency,
army on the streets, helicopters,

32:31.800 --> 32:33.450
all that 28 Days Later shit.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.128
We need to get off the streets.
Back in the block.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.685
Like none of this ever happened.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.449
Yes, boss. Back in the block!

32:39.480 --> 32:41.403
How do we do that
with them things out there?

32:41.440 --> 32:43.044
That's suicide, man.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.009
- You know what?
- What?

32:49.040 --> 32:51.407
I'm shitting myself, innit.
But at the same time...

32:51.920 --> 32:53.126
What?

32:53.160 --> 32:54.764
This is sick.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.164
- (Screeches)
- Fuck!

33:32.680 --> 33:34.762
They're on us!

33:34.800 --> 33:37.485
- Split! Meet at the block!
- Oi, pedal, pedal, pedal!

33:37.520 --> 33:38.726
Jerome, pedal!

33:59.000 --> 34:00.923
(Snarls)

35:11.720 --> 35:12.721
(Screeches)

35:30.560 --> 35:32.608
Stairs, blood!

35:32.640 --> 35:34.529
Move, move, move, move!

35:34.560 --> 35:36.289
Where's Biggz?
Where's Pest?

35:37.840 --> 35:40.161
- Hurry up!
- (All shout)

35:42.280 --> 35:43.930
Go on, run!

35:43.960 --> 35:45.530
Close the door, man!

35:47.280 --> 35:48.850
Fuck!

35:48.880 --> 35:50.086
Grab it!

35:53.680 --> 35:55.603
(All shouting)

35:55.640 --> 35:57.563
Aarghh!

36:06.040 --> 36:08.008
(Splintering of wood)

36:18.000 --> 36:19.889
(Boys shouting)

36:24.640 --> 36:27.211
Hey, snitch!

36:29.320 --> 36:30.970
Move, man! Huh? Move!

36:31.000 --> 36:32.331
Fucking move!

36:35.040 --> 36:37.361
- Hey, come on, blood!
- Get the bag off him!

36:40.440 --> 36:43.410
- Somebody bell Biggz. Where's Biggz?
- I got one text left.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.602
- I got no credit.
- Drop call everybody.

36:45.640 --> 36:49.326
- Pray someone calls back.
- This is too much to explain in one text.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.443
Get out of my fucking flat!

37:03.800 --> 37:05.962
- Shut up, man.
- Pss...

37:06.000 --> 37:08.765
- I said, get out!
- Yo, snitch, calm yourself.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.290
This ain't about you no more.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.767
Come anywhere near me and I swear
I will scream this fucking block down!

37:13.800 --> 37:16.201
There's worse things out there
than us tonight.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.561
Hey, bruv. I saw her ID card thingy.

37:18.600 --> 37:21.444
- She's a nurse, innit.
- Help me, then. I need this leg.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.642
I need it to be able to run away
from them things.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.364
You think I'm gonna help you?

37:25.400 --> 37:28.847
After you attacked me, and robbed me,
and then set those dogs on the police?

37:28.880 --> 37:31.451
- Yes to the first two, no to the last one.
- Dogs?

37:31.480 --> 37:34.006
Dogs with glow-in-the-dark jaws?
Dogs with no eyes?

37:34.040 --> 37:36.486
Dogs the size of gorillas?
D'you think they're dogs?

37:36.520 --> 37:39.763
Go out there and try feedin' 'em
some Pedigree Chum. They're aliens.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.088
Whatever the fuck they are,
they're not fucking aliens.

37:43.120 --> 37:46.329
- You swear too much, man.
- Yeah, you got a potty mouth, man.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.607
Whatever they are,
they're inside the block.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.290
They're after everyone.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.369
Yeah, we're on the same side now.
You get me?

37:58.120 --> 38:01.249
- No feds.
- You'd be better off calling the Ghostbusters.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.329
This is the block. We take care of things
our own way. Get me?

38:04.360 --> 38:06.567
- You're joking?
- Does it look like he's jokin'?

38:06.600 --> 38:10.207
I was gonna call for help.
Your friend needs to go to hospital.

38:10.240 --> 38:13.130
So do you. If those wounds get infected,
they could kill you.

38:13.160 --> 38:16.050
- Nah, he likes his scars, innit.
- Fuck!

38:16.080 --> 38:17.730
He's bleedin' to death! Help him!

38:17.760 --> 38:19.569
We ain't gonna do nothing.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.844
Fix him.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.520
Jesus.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.563
(Both exhale)

38:38.240 --> 38:42.006
<i>TV: It's one of me most extraodinary
spectacles in nature.</i>

38:42.080 --> 38:43.923
What if those kids were right?

38:44.720 --> 38:47.087
What if they're connected -
that freak show animal

38:47.120 --> 38:48.451
and the hole in my dad's car?

38:48.480 --> 38:51.927
What if there is some kind of invasion
and the police are out there?

38:52.560 --> 38:54.767
I can't get busted again.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.928
- You've been busted?
- Yeah.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.130
Left half an oz in my jeans, put them in
the washing machine by mistake and...

39:02.160 --> 39:05.960
I shit you not, my mum's underwear
came out stinking of skunk.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.449
My dad obviously caught a whiff
and cut off my allowance.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.523
Next time, it'll be my testiklees.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.767
Yeah, it's tough times for you, mate.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.763
The irony is, now I've gotta sell
twice the amount just to pay the rent.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.484
I thought you said you lived at home?

39:23.800 --> 39:26.929
Yeah, well, I mean...
I mean "rent" in the proverbial sense.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.089
Oh, yeah. Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do, you know.

39:30.120 --> 39:33.966
A man's gotta put bread on the table -
proverbially speaking, of course.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.525
Fo-shizzle.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.086
Listen, even if it is an alien invasion,

39:38.160 --> 39:40.162
they're four foot high, they're blind

39:40.200 --> 39:42.965
and they got kicked to death
by a group of kids.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.765
- We got nothing to worry about.
- Yeah.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.285
- All right?
- (Laughs) Yeah.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.162
Sorry I messed up your couch.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.406
- Don't worry about it.
- D'you want me to take 'em off?

40:06.200 --> 40:07.611
That won't be necessary.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.722
You sure? I got nice boxers on.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.084
Genuine Calvin Klein. Fresh today.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.161
- Tell me if this hurts.
- Try me.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.121
Ow! Hurts.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.770
- How about this?
- Hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts!

40:21.800 --> 40:24.280
You've torn a few minor arteries.
You might have a fracture.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.607
This needs treating
before you lose too much blood.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.449
- Do it, then.
- I can't do it.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.847
I don't have the equipment or the skill.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.325
I've only just graduated.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.601
And I missed the class
on alien bite wounds.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.085
Stop hyping, man.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.088
Pass me that cushion.

40:38.880 --> 40:41.929
I said, pass me that cushion!

40:42.960 --> 40:44.007
(Tuts)

40:49.880 --> 40:51.769
Oh! Don't take it out on me.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.408
I ain't seen you around here before,
you know.

40:56.480 --> 40:59.563
- You lived here long?
- Couple of months.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.682
Hmm. Nice place you got.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.451
Thanks. Thinking of moving.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.448
Shame. Why?

41:06.480 --> 41:09.563
- I don't like the area.
- What do you mean, don't like the area?

41:09.600 --> 41:11.011
What's wrong with the area?

41:11.080 --> 41:13.367
(Heavy thud on door)

41:13.400 --> 41:14.970
Fam, stay.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.166
(Screeches)

41:38.800 --> 41:40.564
Get off me!

41:42.040 --> 41:43.769
- What was that?
- They found us.

41:43.800 --> 41:47.009
How could they find us?
There's, like, 160 doors in this block.

41:47.040 --> 41:50.123
Whatever gang war you're involved in,
leave me out of it, please.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.810
(Heavy thud)

41:51.840 --> 41:53.968
Hey, this ain't got nothin'
to do with gangs.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.163
Or drugs. Or rap music.
Or violence in video games.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.249
- This is the worst night of my life.
- Feeling's mutual.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.966
- (Warrior cry)
- Moses, don't, man!

42:19.360 --> 42:20.850
Moses.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.405
Ninja!

42:22.440 --> 42:24.090
Tango neutralised.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.488
See? Is that a dog?

42:39.200 --> 42:41.646
- No.
- No, that is not a dog.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.209
That's black.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.685
Too black to see.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.644
That's the blackest black ever, fam.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.730
That's blacker than my cousin Femi.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.962
Oi, where's that woman?

43:06.920 --> 43:09.048
(Distant screeching)

43:20.960 --> 43:22.883
(Screeching intensifies)

43:26.320 --> 43:29.130
Wherever you're going,
I'm coming with you.

43:29.160 --> 43:32.004
After what you put me through tonight,
it's the least you can do.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.566
No way, man.
She's bare annoyin'.

43:34.600 --> 43:37.331
Make her leave.
Let that snitch get murked.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.408
Dennis, why you acting like such a prick?

43:39.440 --> 43:41.408
I need the nurse.
Do you want me to die?

43:41.440 --> 43:44.284
We can't stand around here arguing.
We need to roll. Now!

43:44.960 --> 43:46.644
- My name's Sam.
- Jerome.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.364
- I'm Pest.
- No, man.

43:48.400 --> 43:49.401
Dennis.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.605
You're Moses, right?

43:54.160 --> 43:55.685
You're gonna need a weapon.

44:19.320 --> 44:21.402
OFFICER: Move along, please. Move along.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.324
Yo, bring it, bring it, bring it.

44:32.040 --> 44:34.611
Bring it, bring it, bring it.
Yo, bring the thing, blood.

44:35.600 --> 44:38.001
- What's happening, man?
- Something fucked up.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.328
Hi-Hatz, bruv, there's bare feds in the area,
roadblocks and everything.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.522
Maybe we should chill out
till things die down.

44:43.560 --> 44:46.450
- Are you telling me to chill out?
- No. Wait till things cool down.

44:46.480 --> 44:48.847
- You telling me to cool down?
- Ah, forget it, bruv.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.522
Get in the car.

44:53.800 --> 44:56.326
Get in the car now!

44:58.640 --> 45:00.847
They mash up my whip
with a bully van they stole,

45:00.880 --> 45:03.121
start threatening me about aliens
or some shit,

45:03.200 --> 45:06.090
facing me down,
telling me I'm gonna get shifted.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.407
Hey, watch where you're going,
you prick!

45:08.440 --> 45:12.809
Then, some like...some like big dog,
some big gorilla wolf motherfucker,

45:12.840 --> 45:17.129
comes down from the roof, rolls Tonks,
tears his neck all the way out. Believe.

45:18.600 --> 45:21.171
- So was it a dog, then?
- Don't give a fuck what it was.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.089
Shot that ting. Died easy.

45:23.760 --> 45:26.240
And we gotta learn them youngers
tonight, you get me?

45:26.280 --> 45:28.044
That's my block!

- I think this situation's a bit different.
- Is it?

46:06.440 --> 46:09.649
Walking around,
expecting to get jumped at any moment?

46:09.680 --> 46:11.648
Feels like just another day in the ends to me.

- I called you 50 times, blood.</i>

46:33.720 --> 46:36.769
What's your phone doing on silent
at a time like this for, fam?

46:36.800 --> 46:38.131
<i>- Where you at?
- In the bin.</i>

46:38.160 --> 46:41.164
Same bin I was at that time
them boys from Aylesbury was after me.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.486
(Thudding)

46:42.520 --> 46:45.330
One of them things is trying to headbang
me out. Rescue me, yeah?

46:45.360 --> 46:48.921
Ain't that simple, bruv. Them things
are in the block, busting through doors.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.970
You're the only one with credit.
Call everyone, spread the word.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.525
Tell them to stay inside. Get me?

46:53.600 --> 46:55.602
<i>I'll bell you back when we get to Tia's.</i>

46:56.400 --> 46:57.845
Fuck this, man!

46:57.880 --> 46:59.609
(Rings)

47:02.640 --> 47:04.051
<i>- Yo, Biggz.
- Listen, listen.</i>

47:04.080 --> 47:07.527
<i>I've got one pound credit and bare people
to call. I can only say this once.</i>

47:07.560 --> 47:09.164
<i>We need backup. Alien attack.</i>

47:09.200 --> 47:12.602
Slow down. I don't understand
a word you're saying. Speak slowly.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.768
<i>This ain't no time to be speaking slowly!</i>

47:14.800 --> 47:17.724
<i>Moses and Dennis are heading to Tia's.
Call everyone!</i>

47:17.800 --> 47:20.610
<i>Tell them to come back!
That thing we killed was for real!</i>

47:20.680 --> 47:22.682
<i>Now there's bigger ones battering me...</i>

47:22.720 --> 47:25.371
Phone me later
when you ain't playing Xbox.

47:33.360 --> 47:35.647
Check it. Reginald and Gavin survived.

47:35.680 --> 47:38.968
Don't answer those names no more.
It's Probs and Mayhem.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.650
Fam, we saw the aliens.

47:40.680 --> 47:42.648
They ran past us, straight.

47:42.680 --> 47:44.364
We got tools.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.289
(Laughter)

47:46.320 --> 47:49.210
- Let us roll with you, man.
- That's not real, is it?

47:49.280 --> 47:52.011
- Jesus, he looks about six
- I'm nine and a half.

47:52.040 --> 47:55.442
- That ain't a toy, Gavin. Give me that.
- Hey, leave it!

47:56.240 --> 47:57.969
(All talk at once)

47:58.000 --> 47:59.889
Hey. Hey, let go, fam. Oi, let go.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.241
Yo, Reginald, Gavin!

48:03.160 --> 48:06.050
Go home, lock your door.
Do your homework. Watch Naruto.

48:06.080 --> 48:07.923
Just stay inside tonight, get me?

48:09.440 --> 48:11.363
That's my cousin's!
I gotta give it back!

48:11.400 --> 48:13.687
Stop bitching,
You got a Super Soaker still.

48:13.720 --> 48:16.166
You really think they'll die
if you shoot water at them?

48:16.200 --> 48:18.885
Ain't water in it. Is it?

48:20.640 --> 48:24.486
You ain't bringing all them in here. No.
They're involved in something.

48:24.520 --> 48:27.000
Someone's chasing 'em.
They got weapons.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.804
And, look, that one's bleedin'.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.769
And that woman, I don't even know her.

48:30.800 --> 48:34.043
I'm not getting myself involved in
a situation I don't need to be in.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.529
It's my house, Dimples.

48:36.560 --> 48:37.686
Come.

48:38.960 --> 48:41.042
Get off me, man.

48:44.240 --> 48:46.163
(Helicopter whirs, sirens blare)

48:48.680 --> 48:52.321
There's only one helicopter out there.
Copper chopper.

48:52.360 --> 48:55.569
Ain't even military.
And it's only around these ends.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.126
This ain't London-wide.
This is localised.

48:58.160 --> 49:01.482
- Yeah, localised in your head.
- Localised in your dreams.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.443
Drapsed by the feds? Yes.

49:03.480 --> 49:06.643
Big gorilla-alien-wolf monsters
killing everyone? Uh-uh.

49:06.680 --> 49:08.842
- Maybe they only fell on these ends.
- Please!

49:08.880 --> 49:12.089
What kind of alien, out of all the places
in the whole wide world,

49:12.120 --> 49:14.771
would invade some shitty council estate
in South London?

49:14.800 --> 49:18.805
- One that's looking for a fight.
- They're coming for us. Ready or not.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.446
♪ Ready or not, here I come

49:22.480 --> 49:24.881
♪ You can't hide
- Excuse me.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.331
♪ They're gonna find you

49:26.360 --> 49:28.124
Listen to me!

49:28.200 --> 49:30.248
There's a dead one
in my living room.

49:30.320 --> 49:33.290
I live on the first floor.
Go and look if you don't believe me.

49:33.320 --> 49:36.164
You can walk right in.
There's no front door any more.

49:36.200 --> 49:39.170
Moses, when did you start going out
with your maths teacher?

49:39.200 --> 49:40.565
(Laughter)

49:41.480 --> 49:43.687
- How d'you know that woman?
- We met earlier.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.171
He mugged me.

49:45.200 --> 49:48.204
- Whey! For real?
- That part I believe.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.607
That true? You rob that woman?

49:50.640 --> 49:54.201
Yeah. But afterwards she fixed my leg
and we saved her from the monster.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.288
So...we're mates now and it's all sweet.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.127
- We're heroes, innit?
- Heroes?

49:59.800 --> 50:02.770
Five of you and a knife
against one woman? Fuck off!

50:02.800 --> 50:04.290
Raah. Cold.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.051
Nah, nah, nah, don't build it up, luv.
It weren't all that.

50:07.080 --> 50:10.129
- We never even touched you.
- The blade was to get it over with quick.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.083
- We was as scared as you.
- Blade?

50:12.920 --> 50:16.242
You're such a waste.
Why's it always trouble with you?

50:16.280 --> 50:19.523
Why's it always someone gettin' robbed
or beaten up or gettin' arrested?

50:19.560 --> 50:22.291
We can't deal with this on our own.
We have to call the police.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.964
You can trust me.
I'll tell them what really happened.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.570
Think the police will help them?

50:27.600 --> 50:29.887
They might not arrest you,
but they'll arrest them.

50:29.920 --> 50:33.641
For the murder of two police officers,
vehicle theft, resisting arrest -

50:33.680 --> 50:36.365
everything that happened
everywhere in the ends tonight.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.164
They arrest us for nothing already.

50:39.880 --> 50:41.928
You know what I reckon, yeah?

50:41.960 --> 50:44.281
I reckon the feds sent them, anyway.

50:44.320 --> 50:47.130
Government probably bred
those creatures to kill black boys.

50:48.160 --> 50:51.403
First they sent drugs to the ends,
then they sent guns.

50:52.040 --> 50:53.963
Now they sent monsters to get us.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.923
They don't care, man.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.803
We ain't killin' each other fast enough,

50:57.840 --> 50:59.729
so they decided
to speed up the process.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.042
- Believe.
- (Girls laugh)

51:04.960 --> 51:08.487
Pest, I told you not to do that!
Do it out the window, yeah?

51:08.520 --> 51:10.249
It's pain relief. Ask the nurse.

51:13.800 --> 51:16.087
Excuse me, but what is that?

51:22.520 --> 51:24.568
- Oh, my days!
- (Screaming)

51:28.960 --> 51:31.122
- You can't take two, fam.
- Watch me.

51:31.760 --> 51:33.842
(Caps bang)

51:33.880 --> 51:36.281
Shit. It is a toy!

51:40.920 --> 51:42.251
(Screaming)

51:45.680 --> 51:48.206
Help! Hey, Moses!

51:50.600 --> 51:51.647
Dennis!

51:51.680 --> 51:53.205
(Screaming)

51:57.560 --> 51:59.244
(Screaming)

52:01.520 --> 52:03.284
(Snarls)

52:08.200 --> 52:10.680
- Moses.
- It's coming for you, Moses!

52:16.960 --> 52:18.450
Oi, you fucker!

52:19.640 --> 52:21.608
Tia, what you doing?

52:23.240 --> 52:24.241
Back!

52:26.000 --> 52:28.765
Bash it! Kill it! Kill it!

52:42.800 --> 52:44.723
- Don't stop!
- Harder! Cut him!

52:50.240 --> 52:52.163
Kill him! Harder!

52:58.320 --> 52:59.924
Oh, shit!

53:06.720 --> 53:08.484
(Breath wheezes)

53:11.200 --> 53:14.363
Yo, youngers, wagwan?

53:14.400 --> 53:15.811
- Nothing much.
- All right.

53:15.840 --> 53:17.842
Nice weapons. Who you fightin'?

53:17.880 --> 53:19.928
- Aliens.
- Is it?

53:19.960 --> 53:22.167
- Seen that yout Moses lately?
- Who wants to know?

53:23.200 --> 53:26.761
He called us for backup.
Help him fight the aliens off.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.086
Bang! Bang! Bang!

53:28.880 --> 53:31.724
So, where's he at?

53:40.400 --> 53:42.323
(Sobbing)

53:43.600 --> 53:46.046
You know that little one
you killed before?

53:46.080 --> 53:47.605
That was a mistake.

53:47.640 --> 53:50.291
They weren't going for us.
They were going for you.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.641
Actions have consequences, you know.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.762
Everywhere you go, bad things happen.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.687
TIA: Stay away from us, Moses.

53:57.760 --> 53:59.683
(Alien screeches)

54:14.480 --> 54:17.404
You should leave.
I don't want no one else to die.

54:17.440 --> 54:20.649
- Fuck that, bruv. I got your back.
- I ain't going nowhere.

54:20.680 --> 54:24.082
They took Dennis.
We gotta kill all them things, bruv.

54:27.760 --> 54:29.091
Come on!

54:32.440 --> 54:34.169
Come on!

54:40.400 --> 54:42.164
Easy kill.

54:46.600 --> 54:48.523
Run, man! Come on!

54:48.560 --> 54:51.404
- What are you waiting for?
- Shit!

54:51.440 --> 54:53.124
Open the door! Go!

54:54.680 --> 54:56.603
(Screaming and gunshots)

55:04.640 --> 55:07.644
<i>Wagwan, it's young Den.
If it's girls, leave a message.</i>

55:07.680 --> 55:09.364
<i>Mandem, I'm on the block, innit.</i>

55:09.400 --> 55:11.243
Dennis, fam, I made bare calls.

55:11.280 --> 55:14.250
Everyone's come down to back us,
blood, but no one can get inside.

55:14.280 --> 55:16.362
Feds have the block on lockdown.

55:16.400 --> 55:19.085
<i>You've got one minute remaining.</i>

55:19.120 --> 55:22.329
I ain't got much credit.
And I can't be in this bin much longer.

55:22.360 --> 55:23.850
I need to make a break for it.

55:24.560 --> 55:26.528
I'll see you at the other side, yeah?

55:34.160 --> 55:35.924
Aargh!

55:36.680 --> 55:38.489
Hey, what the fuck, man!

55:40.600 --> 55:42.807
Why won't someone flippin' rescue me?

55:49.120 --> 55:51.043
(Panicked shouting)

55:56.160 --> 55:58.083
(Singing to himself)

56:21.040 --> 56:22.485
(Lift bell)

56:40.960 --> 56:43.691
Better get the next one, blood.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.404
(Lift bell)

57:01.200 --> 57:03.123
(Door closes)

57:08.400 --> 57:10.243
(Lift clunks)

57:10.280 --> 57:12.851
(Muffled shouting)

57:12.880 --> 57:14.803
Go, man!

57:17.720 --> 57:20.041
- Who was that?
- That's Hi-Hatz.

57:20.080 --> 57:22.321
- Man's a sausage.
- Why is he shooting at us?

57:22.360 --> 57:24.442
His best friend got ate
and he's a bit vexed.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.289
(Thud and alien screeching)

57:26.320 --> 57:28.209
I know exactly how he feels.

57:28.240 --> 57:30.811
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

57:30.880 --> 57:34.362
What's chasing you? Why is
the other lift full of bits of dead people?

57:34.400 --> 57:35.890
What? We need to go down.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.561
I ain't going down. There's too many
things down there out to get me.

57:39.600 --> 57:43.969
True say. Bare police, crazy gangsters
and fucked-up monsters down there.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.685
OK. Good. Let's not go down.
Where can we go?

57:46.720 --> 57:49.849
- We're going to Ron's weed room.
- What's Ron's weed room?

57:49.880 --> 57:52.611
It's a big room full of weed.
And it's Ron's. It's good.

57:52.640 --> 57:54.927
- It's like Fort fucking Knox up there.
- Plan.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.166
19.

57:57.120 --> 58:01.125
Bravo Team, on me, on me. Hold positions.

58:03.760 --> 58:07.606
(Groans) This is long, man. They've all gone.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.881
No, they ain't. Check it.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.923
(Lift bell)

58:36.680 --> 58:39.126
- Down the end.
- Raah.

58:42.680 --> 58:44.808
I am too high for this shit.

58:45.440 --> 58:46.805
Trust.

58:50.080 --> 58:52.731
- I wanna shoot those things, man.
- Same here, bruv.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.570
- Times three.
- Done now.

59:11.560 --> 59:13.483
(Aliens screeching)

59:17.360 --> 59:19.806
(Fireworks whistling and exploding)

59:21.080 --> 59:23.890
- Bangers, man, bangers!
- I'm Brewis, by the way.

59:23.920 --> 59:25.729
- Sam.
- Front pocket, man.

59:26.400 --> 59:30.007
I'm meant to be at a party in Fulham.
Now I'm trapped in this bloody block.

59:30.040 --> 59:33.249
Yo, Pest. Get ready with that lighter.
Yeah, pass it, pass it.

59:33.280 --> 59:35.282
- What about you?
- I live here.

59:36.160 --> 59:37.605
Really?

59:37.640 --> 59:38.926
Wicked.

59:38.960 --> 59:40.724
I'm set.

59:44.240 --> 59:46.163
(Firework explosions die down)

59:56.120 --> 59:58.327
Lights. Stay close.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.327
Go. Go, go.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.569
JEROME: Hurry up, man. Keep moving.
BREWIS: Wait for me.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.643
PEST: Fire in the hole.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.128
JEROME: Get the fuck off me, man.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.967
Jesus. There's one behind us. Run!

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.170
Jerome, where are you, man?

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.444
(Alien screeches)

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.970
Jerome!

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.721
(Screeching)

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.485
MOSES: Jerome! Where you at?

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.124
Jerome!

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.804
PEST:Jerome?
- (Alien screeches)

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.002
I can't see shit, man!
Come on, come on. Come on.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.923
Pest? Moses?

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.363
Pest! Moses!

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.250
- Aaarghh!
- Jerome, where you at?

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.170
- Oi, lights, man, lights!
- Trying to find 'em, man.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.848
I'm going back. Stay by the lights.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.160
MOSES: Are you there, man?

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.843
They're coming up the stairs, quick.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.450
Jerome?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.160
Help! Help!

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.168
- Aargh!
- Follow me!

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.771
They got Jerome. Moses!

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.724
They took him!
They took Jerome!

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.208
- Man!
- Oh!

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.448
What the fuck was that for?

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.162
Moses, blood!
Come on, man, they'll kill you!

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.205
Moses!

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.130
(Screeching)

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.523
- Yo, Ron! Ron!
- Ron, man, let us in!

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.925
- Ron!
- Open the door, man!

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.281
- Hey, let us in, man!
- Hey, open the door!

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.607
- All right?
- We need to hide in your weed room.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.842
It's the only safe place left in the block.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.763
I don't know about that.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.608
- Ah, come on! Hurry up!
- All right, all right.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.005
Come on.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.207
Wagwan, Moses?

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.080
Sorry.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.329
(Screeching)

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.810
- You killed that thing.
- Hi-Hatz, bruv...

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.287
- You brought it in the ends.
- I don't want no trouble.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.049
You brought fed in the ends.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.128
Listen to me, bruv.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.324
You brought an alien invasion
to the ends.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.361
Shit.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.845
Behind you, bruv.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.723
- Don't chat me.
- I'm not even lyin'..

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.444
Shut up!

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.084
I was gonna make you.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.691
Now...I'm gonna dead you.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.402
This is my block. Get me?

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.651
Not really.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.085
(Screeching)

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.323
(Shouting)

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.280
(Splat)

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.563
(Screeching)

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.441
Wish I'd never chased after that thing.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.048
Wish we never murked you.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.280
I wish I never took that white off Hi-Hatz.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.969
Wish I'd just gone home
and played FIFA like Biggz said.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.043
Anyone got skins?

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.203
No.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.009
Bare weed and no skins.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.042
This is my worst nightmare.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.008
Listen, yeah.
We never knew you lived in the block.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.811
If... If we knew you,
we wouldn't have stepped you.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.640
It would have been OK to mug me
if I didn't live here? Is that how it works?

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.284
Boy, you's tetchy.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.448
He's tryin' to apologise to you, man.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.768
You're quite fit, you know.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.728
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yeah.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.886
Are you sure about him?
Where is he?

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.287
Cos he ain't exactly
looking after you tonight.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.125
- He's in Ghana.
- You go out with an African man?

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.482
No, he's helping children.
He volunteers for the Red Cross.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.409
Oh, is it?

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.441
Why can't he help
the children of Britain?

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.403
Not exotic enough, is it?

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.363
Don't get no nice suntan.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.128
Raah. Moses, your jacket's gone rave.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.611
It's glowing in the UV light.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.762
Maybe it's some kind of pheromone.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.090
PEST: Maybe it's a what now?

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.726
Er...it's an eco-hormone
that triggers a social response

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.603
in members of the same species.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.329
Maybe that's a female
and the others are male,

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.603
and that... that... that stuff
is what's attracting them here.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.529
They're smelling us.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.081
They fell out of the sky, yeah?

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.331
Well, maybe they like drift through space
on... on solar winds, like spores,

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.886
and...whatever planet they land on first,

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.685
the female leaves a pheromone trail
for the males to follow it,

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.848
find it, breed, et cetera.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.042
Like bees, like beetles, like moths.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.367
Some fucking funny-looking moth.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.407
Yeah.

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.761
Well, whatever it is, you're covered in it

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:26.691
and it seems to be piquing the interest
of a rather hostile alien species.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.644
I'm just just saying,
maybe if you took those clothes off,

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.409
they wouldn't know we were here.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.125
You fancy him or something?
Are you trying to get him naked?

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.401
No, I'm trying to save your life.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.730
And in answer to your question earlier...

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.162
Ah, thank fuck.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.881
Bruv, I swear I will never cuss you again.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.681
Yo, Brewis.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.530
Everyone who touched this thing
got murked, you know -

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.764
Dennis...

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.165
Jerome...

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.611
Tonks...

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.642
them feds when they tried touch me,

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.488
everyone who had that scent on them.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.567
So if they follow the smell on that, then...

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.327
..maybe I can lead 'em.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.961
- Lead them where?
- Somewhere I can blow them up.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.168
I killed that thing.
I brought them in the block.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.803
I've gotta finish what I started.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.124
- What if it jumps at us?
- Then throw the banger.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.401
- What if I miss?
- Then we run.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.568
What if it kills us?

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:52.090
No one is gonna ever call you Mayhem
if you keep on acting like such a pussy.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.043
(Mobile beeping)

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.284
I'm tellin' the truth! I know I lied to you before,
but it's for real this time, I swear!

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.483
<i>- (Screeching)
- ..I'm calling your dad. You hear me?</i>

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.045
Throw it, throw it, throw it!

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.121
Now, now, do it!

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.731
<i>- Are you even listening?
- Mum, I gotta go.</i>

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.524
Just do as I say and stay indoors.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.523
I won't ever do anything bad again,
I promise.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.962
<i>- I love you, Mum. I love you.
- Five minutes!</i>

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.923
(Screeching)

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.567
- Any time, blood. Any time.
- We don't give a fuck, man.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.363
Armed police. Stay where you are!

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:46.810
BOTH: Fuck.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.087
- Wagwan, Biggz.
- What are you doing?

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.645
- Armed police, fam.
- Swear down?

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.966
- Swear down.
- (Shouting)

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.082
You burnt that thing good. Ratings.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.010
- Easy peasy.
- Lemon squeezy.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.569
Probs and Mayhem, right?

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.563
BOTH: Yeah.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.843
(Sirens wail)

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.564
You look clean.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.926
You look good.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.202
I'm betting my life we're right about this.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.765
Believe me, I'd go out there myself
if I wasn't so profoundly stoned.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:41.962
Likewise.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:52.201
- One floor down. 191.
- One floor down. 191.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.368
- You bell me when you get there.
- Yeah.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.521
Yo, Pest, give me that ring.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.846
(Tuts)

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.251
What ring, man?

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.926
Oh, man, that's ours.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.687
- It's worth bare P, man.
- Give it!

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.684
Raasclaat, man.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.891
Thanks.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.764
Even if you outrun them,
even if you make it,

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.165
how are you gonna get out?

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.888
Don't worry about me, man.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.089
You don't have to do this, Moses.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.363
Yeah, I do.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.884
Oi. Hi.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.524
Is it safe?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.810
No. All right. Good luck.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.961
(Roars)

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.486
<i>- Are you sure no one's here?
- Yeah.</i>

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.931
Who do you live with?

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.405
Just my uncle.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.045
Where's he?

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.406
Comes and goes.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.204
Goes, mostly.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.605
You got a little brother?

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.766
No.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.605
<i>- How old are you?
- 15.</i>

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.045
You look older.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.881
Thanks.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.885
Shut the hatch.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.684
<i>Lock the window.</i>

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.802
<i>Leave the front door on the latch.</i>

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.320
<i>- (Gas hisses)
- Turn all the gas all the way up.</i>

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.450
<i>Get out the block as fast as you can.
You hear me?</i>

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.045
Good luck, Moses.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.171
Later.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.202
Moses versus the monsters.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.005
Kill 'em. Kill all them things.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.724
Allow it.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.129
(Frenzied screeching)

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.085
(Screeching and roaring)

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.489
(Screaming)

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.601
(Shocked gasps)

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.403
(Siren wails)

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.884
- Is that Moses?
- Moses!

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.887
Moses.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.843
(Whirr of helicopter)

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.043
(Panting)

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.201
(Strains)

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.963
(Panting)

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.011
- Oh, shit.
- Is that more of the monsters?

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.280
Sort of.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.002
Armed police! Put your weapons down!

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.849
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.603
Armed police! Drop your weapon!
Hands on head!

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.083
Drop your weapon now!

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.329
PEST: Get off me!
- This one?

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.124
Aaargh, get off.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.128
Get off me. Aaargh.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.844
Stop resisting. Stop resisting.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.930
- I ain't resisting. You're pushin' me over.
- I don't even live here.

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.645
I am registered disabled.
You're hurting me.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.887
What's your number?
What's your number, huh?

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.163
I know my civil liberties.
I'm a member of fucking Amnesty.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.361
Get off me!

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:30.730
Our Moses saved the planet!
He saved the planet from alien invasion.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.762
He's a hero. He's a legend.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.724
Moses. Call me, yeah?
We'll get you help.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.808
- Call me.
- Yo, Moses.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.763
Hey, Moses. Moses.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.243
