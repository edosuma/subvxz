"Farmer Brown has 50 potatoes

Short skirt for math,
Monday.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.334
How'd it go?

01:47.334 --> 01:50.334
Ah, he's still constipated.

01:51.767 --> 01:55.868
If he was any tighter,
you could wear him to the prom.

01:55.868 --> 01:57.400
You mean to tell me

01:57.400 --> 02:01.601
he didn't react at all
to the picture of you naked?

02:01.601 --> 02:05.200
Because just the thought of it
would work for me.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.000
Well, I guess we have
to give him his pill.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.167
Yeah, but he'll
spit it out

02:08.167 --> 02:09.167
if we don't wrap it

02:09.167 --> 02:10.533
in something
that tastes good.

Well, let's see
what we've got.

How about this thing
in the tinfoil that's moving?

02:21.400 --> 02:22.601
No!

02:22.601 --> 02:25.334
Mom said never to touch that.

02:25.334 --> 02:26.501
I know.

02:27.501 --> 02:30.534
How about this piece of cheese?

02:30.534 --> 02:34.000
The mouse wouldn't eat it,
but maybe Buck will.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.601
Well, it can't be
all that old.

02:35.601 --> 02:37.767
It's still green.

Mm-hmm.
Okay.

already up and out,

from my wallet...

Well, since Mom
and Kelly's boyfriends

03:27.567 --> 03:28.934
have their own keys,

03:28.934 --> 03:30.901
it's probably
the mailman.

to know I'm retiring

be a big day.

getting warm.

will settle it.

Audited?

04:24.300 --> 04:26.100
Peg, I'm gonna
be audited!

04:26.100 --> 04:28.067
Very nice.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.734
I just spent three hours
in the beauty parlor,

04:30.734 --> 04:33.267

is "I'm being audited."

04:33.267 --> 04:35.367
Huh! Why do I bother?

04:35.367 --> 04:37.467
What's "audited"?

04:37.467 --> 04:38.501
Well, basically,

04:38.501 --> 04:40.167
it's when they take
everything you own

04:40.167 --> 04:42.000
and throw you in jail.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.968
But just Dad, right?

Yeah.

our tax records,

the moron

Oh, now, don't get
that look on your face.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.968
It's a good thing
I did the taxes.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.868
You see,
I had this idea.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.968
If claiming two children
as dependents

05:05.968 --> 05:07.067

would be worth.

up the river with me.

to sign my name
to that return too.

a parking ticket.

they sent Capone away for.
