WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.372
Previously on Limitless...
It's about time
you and me talked.

00:04.405 --> 00:07.075
Do you know who I am?
Everybody says
you're gonna be president soon.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.310
But between me and you, I don't
even know if I'm gonna run.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.444
The world needs to be
willing to change.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.080
And it takes leaders
who are willing

00:12.113 --> 00:14.082
to cut through the noise
and play the game

00:14.115 --> 00:15.549
and win the game.
And that's you?

00:15.583 --> 00:17.318
I think so.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.787
You belong to Mr. Morra
now, which means

00:19.820 --> 00:21.422
you belong to me.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.492
When I'm on NZT, I can think
through all the different

00:24.525 --> 00:27.161
angles, every perspective.
Then shouldn't
you have known

00:27.195 --> 00:29.230
that I was gonna shoot Casey?
You texted me.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.132
Yeah, I... I didn't think
you'd shoot.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.234
Lower your weapon.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.169
But I did.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.205
(low conversations)

00:38.639 --> 00:40.641
*

00:42.210 --> 00:44.212
(hinges creaking)

00:50.451 --> 00:52.753
Sorry, ma'am, gonna have
to take a quick peek.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.488
The senator's giving a speech
a few blocks down.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.390
Senator?

00:56.424 --> 00:58.626
He, uh, holds office in
one of two legislative bodies

00:58.659 --> 01:00.594
that make the laws
for this country.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.430
I know what a senator is.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.698
Have a nice day, ma'am.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.749
(trilling, chirping)

01:21.782 --> 01:23.351
(lock clicks)

01:26.287 --> 01:27.155
(door closes)

01:27.188 --> 01:29.457
*

01:49.877 --> 01:51.779
Sir?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.814
They're ready for you.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.884
Okay.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.408
(applause, cheering)

02:22.243 --> 02:24.245
(cheering, whistling)

02:26.414 --> 02:27.581
Thank you.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.218
Thank you.
Please, sit down.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.386
You know,
when the wars were done,

02:32.420 --> 02:34.555
they didn't scrap this ship.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.557
They found
a new mission for her.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.393
The Intrepid was used
as a recovery vessel

02:39.427 --> 02:41.429
EDDIE (to self): Piece of glass
just caught the light.
for the Gemini and Mercury...

02:41.462 --> 02:42.863
Could be someone
with binoculars.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.633
I'd like to give the same
dignity to our veterans

02:45.666 --> 02:47.868
that we gave to this ship.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.870
Someone's taking a shot at me.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.873
Call it 3,300 yards.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.445
That'd be the longest kill
of all time.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.447
I hire as many vets as I can...

02:59.480 --> 03:00.614
NZT.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.483
Piper.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.984
She'll breathe out
before she shoots,

03:04.017 --> 03:05.786
so let's think this through.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.622
Not on the table, obviously.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.658
I could jump out of the way.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.927
Not bad.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.963
But what if the bullet
just grazes me?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.433
Yeah.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.601
That'll do.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.243
(crowd shrieking, screaming)

03:49.630 --> 03:51.632
(phone dings)

03:53.634 --> 03:55.569
They need you upstairs
right now.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.512
BRIAN:
I saw the news.
Of course I did.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.347
The whole city was
talking about what happened

04:06.380 --> 04:07.515
to Senator Morra.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.516
Let's review all the ways

04:08.549 --> 04:09.883
this could go wrong.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.586
Ah. Jarrod Sands,
this is Brian Finch.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.522
He consults with us
on priority cases.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.358
Mr. Sands is a
security consultant

04:17.391 --> 04:18.726
for Senator Edward Morra.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.361
Brian and I know each other.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.365
We are in a clandestine
relationship.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.633
The senator and I

04:25.666 --> 04:27.735
give him immunity
from the side effects of NZT

04:27.768 --> 04:29.737
in exchange for him
reporting back to me

04:29.770 --> 04:32.473
on what you lot get up to.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.075
That explains so...

04:35.108 --> 04:36.744
so much.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.646
Should we just
arrest him now, then?

04:38.679 --> 04:40.314
If you like.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.816
Or I could take care of him
round the back.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.553
Okay, it's not in his best
interest to take that approach,

04:45.586 --> 04:46.654
but Rebecca is wicked smart.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.590
What if she figures it out?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.560
The senator's sorry
he can't be here personally.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.762
Anything my team
can do to assist you.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.765
Great. We should also
address the fact

04:57.798 --> 05:00.368
that you are in a clandestine
relationship with Brian.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.903
I'm guessing you
give him immunity

05:02.936 --> 05:04.372
to NZT's side effects

05:04.405 --> 05:06.073
and he tells you
what we're up to?

05:06.106 --> 05:08.542
That is so not true.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.911
They know.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.581
Once I'm in the car,
nuke the building from orbit.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.584
Yeah, it's the only way
to be sure.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.686
(explosion)

05:18.719 --> 05:21.021
I imagined it all kinds
of different ways.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.557
Can we talk about Senator
Morra's eyes for a second?

05:23.591 --> 05:24.758
Amazing, right?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.394
Blue.

05:27.595 --> 05:30.598
But what really happened
was Sands basically ignored me.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.400
And they talked about
hate mail.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.668
Senator Morra has
some powerful enemies

05:34.702 --> 05:36.470
from a few different
conglomerates,

05:36.504 --> 05:40.107
but personally I'd be surprised
if they'd make a play for him.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.942
Was there any evidence
at the scene?

05:41.975 --> 05:44.878
Um, no evidence was found
at the sniper's nest,

05:44.912 --> 05:46.113
and the only information we got

05:46.146 --> 05:47.781
from the two security guards
on the scene

05:47.815 --> 05:49.450
was a basic description
of the woman

05:49.483 --> 05:50.584
who they think
was the shooter, so...

05:50.618 --> 05:53.521
Yeah, unfortunately, we've had
to use private security.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.756
It's the best I can do
until the senator decides

05:55.789 --> 05:57.425
whether he's gonna run
for president.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.627
We'll interview everyone
who works at the hotel.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.061
Thank you, everyone.

06:01.094 --> 06:04.698
The senator will be sincerely
grateful for your help.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.401
Rebecca?
Mm-hmm?

06:07.435 --> 06:09.503
Can I have a
word, please?

06:10.538 --> 06:11.939
(sighs)

06:11.972 --> 06:13.974
How are you holding up?

06:14.007 --> 06:15.609
I'm all right.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.711
Uh...

06:17.745 --> 06:21.449
Boyle was the one
who had to pull the trigger.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.785
But you were dating Casey Rooks,
were you not?

06:24.818 --> 06:29.022
But it wasn't serious,
so that's why I never filled out

06:29.056 --> 06:30.991
the "Status of Relationship"
HR form.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.426
I...

06:34.194 --> 06:36.964
They're gonna make this
an issue, aren't they?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.832
Like I was trying
to hide something.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.167
No, they're not.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.970
Because you're gonna
sign the form now,

06:43.003 --> 06:45.473
you're gonna back-date it,
and I'll make it official.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.542
Why would you do that?

06:48.576 --> 06:49.910
Because you told me the truth.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.080
And I don't think
you did anything wrong.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.717
Rook's actions
were entirely his own.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.886
The form is just
a bunch of lawyers

06:58.919 --> 07:00.721
trying to save their asses.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.224
Thank you.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.693
Oh, please.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.795
I've been single
ever since I joined the Bureau.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.730
Do you think I haven't slept
with anyone here?

07:10.831 --> 07:11.965
We're busy.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.834
How else are we
supposed to meet people?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.804
(elevator bell dings)

07:20.674 --> 07:21.809
(sighs)

07:22.843 --> 07:24.578
Eyes front, mate.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.480
They got cameras in here.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.681
I'll tell you
everything.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.082
If we get a name, you'll
have it right away.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.084
I was gonna e-mail you.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.553
Can you hit 15 for me, please?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.822
Some friends of mine
lately, we've been playing

07:34.855 --> 07:35.923
this board game
called Arkham Horror.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.659
It's this cooperative thing
where you work together

07:38.692 --> 07:41.194
to defeat the monsters
of the Lovecraft canon.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.830
We could always use a fourth.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.734
Oh, sorry, you're probably
really busy.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.670
(quietly): You always come off
as so desperate.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.839
Hey, James,
you know what?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.140
That actually sounds
pretty awesome.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.609
Just give me
a text, okay?

07:55.643 --> 07:58.045
Oh, wait,
I don't have your number.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.081
We've got a name.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.951
The woman who tried to shoot
Mr. Morra is Piper Baird.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.218
So you already know who did it.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.654
We're fairly certain.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.756
Piper used to work
for Mr. Morra.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.592
The parting of ways
was not amicable.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.564
We supplied her with NZT
until she went a bit mad,

08:16.597 --> 08:19.733
declared war on Mr. Morra
and anyone associated with him.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.235
She's been a terrible pain,
to be honest.

08:22.269 --> 08:25.172
We're gonna find her, and we're
gonna sort the problem out.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.608
But in the meantime,
your job is to make sure

08:27.641 --> 08:30.277
that the FBI never learn
the name Piper Baird.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.647
So you want me to sabotage
the investigation?

08:33.681 --> 08:36.183
If the FBI finds this woman
before we do,

08:36.216 --> 08:38.819
she can tie
the senator to NZT.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.723
Which means Mr. Morra
goes to jail or flees.

08:42.756 --> 08:46.994
Which means no more
booster shots for you.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.231
If she manages to get to
Mr. Morra before we get her...

08:51.264 --> 08:53.333
No more booster shots.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.569
(bell dings)

08:59.206 --> 09:00.307
(keyless lock beeps)

09:00.340 --> 09:02.042
Until we have Piper Baird,

09:02.075 --> 09:04.344
your fate is tied
to Senator Morra's.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.113
Do what you need to do

09:06.146 --> 09:08.982
to keep them far away
from that woman.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.018
*

09:16.289 --> 09:19.292
*

09:42.215 --> 09:44.652
What happened with Casey
wasn't anybody's fault but his.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.286
If someone's trying
to put it on Rebecca,

09:46.319 --> 09:47.387
that's almost as ridiculous

09:47.420 --> 09:49.189
as somebody trying
to put it on me.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.924
BRIAN:
Boyle is still upset.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.893
I told him he didn't need
to kill Casey.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.728
I'm guessing I'll be
hearing about it for a while.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.730
I paid attention with one ear

09:56.764 --> 09:58.799
but mostly spent the drive
learning more about the woman

09:58.832 --> 10:00.934
I was supposed to be
make sure Boyle never found.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.937
Now I don't know what a typical
assassin's background is,

10:03.971 --> 10:06.006
but I'm pretty sure it
doesn't involve a scholarship

10:06.039 --> 10:08.842
to study neurochemistry
at Johns Hopkins.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.311
Completely normal childhood,
good kid, great student,

10:11.344 --> 10:13.113
but when her mother's
Alzheimer's got bad,

10:13.146 --> 10:15.916
Piper dropped out of school
to take care of her.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.085
After that,
there wasn't much about her.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.654
Not until 14 months ago,
anyway.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.323
Her boyfriend was stabbed
to death while he was asleep.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.292
Piper was in the apartment,
but she ran

10:25.325 --> 10:26.994
before the police got there.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.162
She's their top suspect.

10:29.196 --> 10:32.132
(honking)
Spelman?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.034
What was that for?

10:34.067 --> 10:36.804
You had that "zoned out"
look while I was talking.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.305
(scoffs)

10:38.338 --> 10:39.940
(distorted talking)

10:39.973 --> 10:41.208
...private security...

10:41.241 --> 10:43.276
...a woman
between five four and five six

10:43.310 --> 10:46.947
carried eight or so
shopping bags into the suite...

10:46.980 --> 10:49.049
...didn't leave much behind
in the way of evidence...

10:49.082 --> 10:51.985
A woman brought the rifle in
with a bunch of shopping bags,

10:52.019 --> 10:53.420
and we don't know
anything else. That it?

10:53.453 --> 10:57.858
You know, that "I barely
listen to anything you
say" recap thing you do?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.060
It's rude.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.833
*

11:12.272 --> 11:14.975
There was no evidence at all
in the suite--

11:15.008 --> 11:16.777
Piper's thorough--

11:16.810 --> 11:19.046
but I couldn't stop staring
at something.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.014
There's fresh ink
on this drawing.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.016
Actually,
I think it's eyeliner.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.217
It's barely even dry.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.920
I wouldn't have noticed it
if it wasn't for the NZT,

11:26.954 --> 11:30.057
which I think is the point--

11:30.090 --> 11:32.092
someone's testing me.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.966
That's Piper.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.968
She's on NZT.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.003
Why does she need the laser?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.038
Why risk tipping me off?

11:45.072 --> 11:47.941
She knew I'd have to be
on NZT to notice the painting.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.977
Unless...

11:53.013 --> 11:54.982
Dot, dot, dash.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.483
That's Morse code.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.019
She's sending me a message?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.327
You okay, Finch?
You look kind of pale.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.162
I'm okay.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.531
Any brilliant insights?

12:11.564 --> 12:14.001
Uh, yeah.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.170
The shooter
apparently used the balcony.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.543
How did we even function
before you came along?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.611
Okay, let's head back.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.314
All right, I want you to
review the security footage.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.083
See if you have any more of
those... penetrating insights.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.487
Find Sammy DiPietro?

12:34.521 --> 12:38.325
She might as well ask me
to find Bigfoot.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.928
*

12:40.961 --> 12:43.063
DiPietro was a union leader
with ties to the Mafia.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.965
He vanished in the '70s.

12:44.998 --> 12:48.035
Everyone assumes he's dead, but
no one's ever found the body.

12:48.068 --> 12:52.105
And why does Piper want
to talk to me, anyway?

12:54.007 --> 12:56.409
Okay, you see that, right?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.211
Piper's good, but she
couldn't keep her face off

12:58.245 --> 12:59.980
all the security footage.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.015
You got to trim
those frames out,

13:02.049 --> 13:04.351
and you got to find
everything you can
about Sammy DiPietro.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.020
I don't know why,
but Piper's testing you.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.489
And if she says you can find
DiPietro, then you can find him.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.459
(exhales)

13:12.492 --> 13:13.793
(tapping keyboard)

13:18.165 --> 13:20.968
You heard Sands, man.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.104
You don't have a choice.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.040
Yeah, I know.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.242
It's just that...

13:29.276 --> 13:32.913
working against the FBI,
betraying Rebecca--

13:32.946 --> 13:36.449
every time I do that, it
gets a little bit easier.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.591
You sure you're not slowly
turning into Finch?

13:44.624 --> 13:46.459
Building models
with colored yarn?

13:47.494 --> 13:50.330
Actually... it's a diagram.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.865
Mm.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.201
But I see your point.
Where is Brian?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.269
Said he was
running down a hunch.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.239
(whispers): For what it's worth,
he seems pretty off his game.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.209
Well, maybe he's internalizing
your attitude towards him.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.911
He's very sensitive.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.112
Nah, we're fine.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.914
How'd it go with Naz?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.548
All good. We just...

14:08.581 --> 14:10.417
We're finishing up
some paperwork.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.053
I had some time to
do some research.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.421
These represent

14:14.454 --> 14:17.257
the five longest confirmed
sniper shots of all time.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.192
The record belongs
to a British officer

14:19.226 --> 14:22.062
who served in Afghanistan:
2,700 yards.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.432
He beat second place
by a whole football field.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.335
This represents the
deck of the Intrepid

14:28.368 --> 14:31.171
and the hotel where
the shot was fired.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.942
3,315 yards.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.410
She took a shot that would
have beaten the old record

14:37.444 --> 14:39.612
by six football fields.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.048
Wow.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.615
The round was standard.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.351
It was fired
from an off-the-shelf rifle.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.253
There was no new technology.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.289
Nobody could make that shot.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.291
Well, maybe she
had some help.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.594
Can you think of anything
that would help someone

14:54.627 --> 14:57.097
do something that was
otherwise impossible?

14:57.130 --> 15:00.100
You're thinking
the sniper was on NZT.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.402
It's a lot of red yarn.

15:02.435 --> 15:06.273
Yeah, and your tape's
not as clean as the way
Brian would do it.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.377
"Find Sammy DiPietro."

15:10.410 --> 15:13.646
Sounded impossible at first,
but when you can plow

15:13.680 --> 15:15.482
through 50 years of files
in a couple of hours,

15:15.515 --> 15:18.251
interesting things
can present themselves.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.155
Fritz Wunderlich?

15:22.189 --> 15:23.490
You know, I was always

15:23.523 --> 15:25.492
more of a Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau man myself.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.161
As far as German
opera goes.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.030
What do you want, kid?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.966
I know you're
Johnny "Opera" Velardi.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.302
Hmm, what gave it away?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.437
I know you have ties
to the Lotito crime family.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.306
Allegedly.
Mm-hmm.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.309
I'm just a retired
truck driver.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.276
Mm, I know.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.445
And you drove the truck
that carried the body

15:45.478 --> 15:48.415
of Sammy DiPietro
in a steel drum

15:48.448 --> 15:52.419
from where he was murdered
to where they stashed him.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.255
Been questioned about it
15 different times.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.590
Who are you?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.293
(scoffs) You certainly
don't look like a Fed.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.295
It's a long story.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.331
Let's just say
I'm a concerned citizen.

16:05.232 --> 16:08.068
To be clear, I don't
think you killed him.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.169
In fact, you probably
didn't even know

16:09.202 --> 16:10.337
what it was
you were transporting.

16:10.370 --> 16:14.774
I just want to know where you
drove the truck that night.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.777
Kid, that was 40 years ago.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.213
Even if I could remember
where I drove that truck,

16:20.247 --> 16:22.715
why would I start talking
after all this time?
(zipper opens)

16:22.749 --> 16:25.352
'Cause I'm gonna make you
an offer you can't refuse.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.419
(scoffs)

16:26.453 --> 16:29.256
This is a bootleg that even
you don't have, Johnny.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.392
You didn't know it,
but you were wire-tapped

16:32.425 --> 16:34.727
for almost 20 years
by the FBI.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.336
(soprano singing aria)

16:43.370 --> 16:46.373
That's your wife.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.610
She's singing to your son
when he was a baby.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.713
It's beautiful.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.783
It's Puccini.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.252
I was sorry to read
what happened to her.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.621
You know,
my aunt had leukemia.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.257
That is
the master copy,

17:04.291 --> 17:06.259
and it is all yours
if you just tell me

17:06.293 --> 17:08.161
where you drove
the truck that night.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.300
No one will ever know
we talked.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.638
*

17:18.671 --> 17:20.307
The night Johnny "Opera"
delivered his truck

17:20.340 --> 17:23.176
with its mysterious cargo,
he came here.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.612
He said a new concrete floor
had been poured.

17:25.645 --> 17:29.116
(door closes)
So somewhere
in all this concrete

17:29.149 --> 17:31.118
lies the body
of Sammy DiPietro.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.153
But that's not why I'm here.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.498
Obviously this is where
Piper's been hiding,

17:45.532 --> 17:47.367
but where is she?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.320
*

18:23.836 --> 18:25.338
Mom?!

18:25.372 --> 18:26.439
Dad?!

18:26.473 --> 18:27.440
(Dennis laughs)

18:27.474 --> 18:28.441
Hey!
Brian!

18:28.475 --> 18:29.442
Hi!

18:29.476 --> 18:31.311
Hi.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.546
Is everything okay here, guys?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.415
Of course. Come, sit.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.150
We're just getting to know
your new girlfriend.

18:37.184 --> 18:40.119
*

18:50.630 --> 18:51.698
What's wrong,
Brian?

18:51.731 --> 18:53.700
Nothing, uh, it's just...

18:53.733 --> 18:55.235
I'm surprised to see you.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.336
Here.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.837
With my family.

18:57.870 --> 19:01.508
How could you not tell us
that you had a girlfriend?

19:01.541 --> 19:03.510
Uh, he had this whole
elaborate plan to introduce us.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.179
I just... kind of
got tired of waiting.

19:06.213 --> 19:09.516
Yes, well, our Brian likes
to do things in his own way.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.451
On his own time.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.920
That's okay, I-I think I got
him pretty well figured out.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.723
Piper was just telling us
about your first date.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.890
Oh, yeah?
(timer beeps)

19:17.924 --> 19:21.561
Ah. Oh, well, I assume you're
both gonna stay for dinner.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.963
Oh... (chuckles)
I don't know yet, Mom.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.532
Piper...

19:26.799 --> 19:28.535
...quick word
on the porch, please?

19:30.570 --> 19:31.904
BRIAN: Thanks,
we'll be right back.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.643
I was sensing some tension
between you and your dad.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.610
What did you do?

19:37.644 --> 19:40.480
Listen to me: my family
is not a part of this.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.814
You can't really believe that.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.850
Not after being around
Morra for this long.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.388
Did you tell anyone I was here?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.457
Relax, I just need to know
if you're telling the truth.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.925
Does Sands know
where I am right now?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.727
No.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.763
(slow, rhythmic heartbeat)

20:01.501 --> 20:02.802
I'm not here to
threaten you.

20:02.835 --> 20:03.936
I'm not gonna
hurt your parents.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.905
I just don't
have much time.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.240
I had to learn
everything I could

20:07.274 --> 20:08.641
about the person
Morra is working with.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.510
Yeah? What did you learn?

20:10.543 --> 20:13.313
Classic middle child, which
explains your need for approval.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.648
On the other hand,
your fears of living up

20:15.682 --> 20:17.784
to your successful older
siblings caused you to rebel

20:17.817 --> 20:19.619
and reject mainstream success.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.788
"Resorbed Twin."

20:21.821 --> 20:23.690
You really thought that
was a reasonable band name?

20:24.791 --> 20:26.426
The most important
thing I learned is

20:26.459 --> 20:28.428
that you grew up surrounded
by love and support,

20:28.461 --> 20:30.830
which suggests a strong
moral framework.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.700
Why do you care if I have
a strong moral framework?

20:33.733 --> 20:34.934
And how long were you
in there for?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.469
Seven minutes.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.805
And I care because I
know how Morra works.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.840
He has a way of
corrupting good people.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.375
You're one of them.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.544
Same way I was.

20:44.577 --> 20:48.748
So it's his fault that you
killed your boyfriend?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.284
I didn't kill my boyfriend,
Brian.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.785
Morra did.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.920
Or his people.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.955
And why would they do that?

20:55.988 --> 20:59.926
He came to me when I was
writing my dissertation.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.794
I guess he'd read
some of my work.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.496
He told me about NZT,

21:03.530 --> 21:04.931
how he was trying
to alleviate the side effects

21:04.964 --> 21:06.733
and how, if I could
help him do it,

21:06.766 --> 21:09.001
the pill might
help my mom.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.906
You invented the enzyme?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.543
Well, me and some other people.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.877
I don't know who they are.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.046
Morra kept us
all separate.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.582
He has this way of...

21:22.615 --> 21:25.685
making people think
he's a good person.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.920
How, no matter what he does,

21:27.954 --> 21:30.590
it's all for some greater good.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.394
And one day,
I stopped believing

21:34.427 --> 21:36.629
that it was about anything
other than him.

21:36.663 --> 21:40.500
So I stole a supply of NZT
and the enzyme...

21:42.001 --> 21:45.938
...and he framed me for killing
Colin as retribution.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.741
That's when I decided
he needs to be stopped.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.345
You're running out.

21:52.379 --> 21:55.515
Of NZT, or the enzyme, or both.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.849
You know, something
about the attempt

21:56.883 --> 21:57.984
on Morra seemed desperate.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.753
He has been
on NZT longer

22:00.787 --> 22:02.355
than any human being alive.

22:02.389 --> 22:05.692
You had to know
that he would see that coming.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.994
But you couldn't wait any longer

22:08.027 --> 22:10.863
or you might miss
your one shot forever.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.032
I'm close
to replicating the enzyme,

22:13.065 --> 22:15.968
and when I get there, his plan
to keep NZT to himself,

22:16.002 --> 22:17.370
to keep it from
doing all the good

22:17.404 --> 22:18.571
you and I know
it could...

22:18.605 --> 22:20.039
that's all over.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.775
If you saw me as a threat,
I'd be dead already,

22:22.809 --> 22:23.943
so what is this?

22:23.976 --> 22:25.978
Presumably,
you want something from me.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.482
You're under his thumb,
same way I was.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.951
He took everything
from my life that mattered.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.521
He'll do the same to you,
trust me.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.956
There's only one way out.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.090
What is that?

22:39.025 --> 22:41.661
You're going to help me
kill Eddie Morra.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.966
Where are you going?

22:46.999 --> 22:48.568
I can't just leave.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.903
Your mom made meat loaf.

22:53.673 --> 22:54.941
REPORTER (on TV): Insiders say
they have no idea...

22:54.974 --> 22:57.043
BRIAN: At the end of the night,
I was no closer to knowing

22:57.076 --> 22:58.511
if Piper was
a disgruntled former operative

22:58.545 --> 23:01.881
or a victim of Morra and Sands.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.049
If she was close to making
that enzyme,

23:03.082 --> 23:05.117
she could be another source
for the booster shot.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.153
She could get me free
of the senator.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.741
EDDIE:
...I'll co-sponsor
a new one,

23:28.775 --> 23:30.577
give you 40% of
whatever you want,

23:30.610 --> 23:32.579
which is better than
100% of nothing. Okay?

23:32.612 --> 23:34.881
Well, give my best to Diane.

23:34.914 --> 23:35.948
(phone beeps off)

23:35.982 --> 23:37.584
He's cheating on his wife.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.384
I bring up Diane,

23:38.417 --> 23:39.786
makes him a little
more pliable.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.621
Did you kill
Piper Baird's boyfriend?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.189
(sighs)

23:43.222 --> 23:45.658
She found you.
I thought she might.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.596
What does she want?

23:49.629 --> 23:51.798
She wants to use you
to get to me?

23:51.831 --> 23:54.734
Did you kill her boyfriend?

23:56.803 --> 23:59.672
The work we do...

23:59.706 --> 24:02.675
it's in the shadows, for now.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.677
I operate in the dark
because I have to.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.715
Look, I'll defend what we're
building to my dying breath,

24:08.748 --> 24:09.916
but I wouldn't kill anyone

24:09.949 --> 24:11.718
unless they were threatening
to do the same thing to me.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.152
Is that an answer?

24:14.754 --> 24:16.623
I didn't kill him.
She did.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.691
(exhales)

24:18.725 --> 24:20.760
Piper Baird
is brilliant,

24:20.793 --> 24:22.795
but she is tortured.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.699
And she's a liar.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.703
After I cut her off,

24:30.737 --> 24:32.705
she broke into
one of my R&D facilities

24:32.739 --> 24:35.041
and stole a year's supply
of the enzyme.

24:35.074 --> 24:38.210
And now she's running out
and she's desperate.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.649
You're torn; I understand.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.083
She's very convincing.

24:44.116 --> 24:47.119
But she can't
help you, Brian.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.790
She doesn't know
how to make the enzyme.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.827
In a way, you're lucky,

24:54.861 --> 24:56.596
because in this situation,

24:56.629 --> 24:59.632
the right choice
is the pragmatic choice.

25:00.967 --> 25:04.571
And those don't
come along every day.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.822
Piper's not done
with any of us yet.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.059
One thing left for you to do.

25:31.731 --> 25:34.333
(scoffs)
And use
the NZT wisely.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.169
Don't you two know me
better than that by now?

25:37.203 --> 25:40.673
I'm not going to mean-mug you
on this one, Brian.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.208
You know full well
how this works.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.744
You're due
another shot soon

25:44.777 --> 25:47.146
and this
needs to happen.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.649
Piper came after us.

25:49.682 --> 25:53.786
And now you're the fastest way
to get to her.

25:55.688 --> 25:58.157
Listen, son...

25:58.190 --> 26:01.928
defend what we're building,
Brian.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.230
When you're done,

26:04.263 --> 26:05.832
chuck it in the river.

26:05.865 --> 26:06.999
It's untraceable.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.159
(exhales)

26:33.192 --> 26:34.193
Where the hell
have you been?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.362
Boyle and I have been
trying you all morning.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.731
Yeah, sorry.
I had stuff to do.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.100
We got an anonymous tip
in the middle of the night.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.202
A woman matching the description

26:43.235 --> 26:44.704
the security
guards gave you

26:44.737 --> 26:46.038
was found hiding in an
abandoned building uptown.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.874
SWAT just picked her up.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.175
Boyle's questioning her now.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.112
Who's that?

26:53.145 --> 26:55.715
Her name is
Brandy Jo Hawkins.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.785
She just confessed
to shooting Senator Morra.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.993
BRIAN:
That woman? Brandy Jo Hawkins?

27:07.026 --> 27:08.895
She obviously didn't
shoot Senator Morra,

27:08.928 --> 27:10.730
but she makes a great suspect.

27:10.763 --> 27:13.766
She was one of the first
female snipers in the military.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.702
She had four
confirmed kills in Iraq,

27:15.735 --> 27:16.936
then got kicked
out of the military

27:16.969 --> 27:18.705
for hitting a superior officer.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.406
She was an easy target
to be radicalized

27:20.439 --> 27:22.074
by a grass-roots militia.

27:22.108 --> 27:25.745
The way she told it,
Brandy had means and motive.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.446
She knew details.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.949
She said a meth dealer
gave her an NZT pill.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.819
Senator Morra wants the FBI
to stop looking for Piper.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.286
Best way to do that?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.923
Give them a different shooter.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.892
God knows how he got that
poor woman to take the fall.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.734
Okay, so Morra and Sands
have their patsy.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.936
That leaves one thing
on their to-do list.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.337
Piper.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.471
They want me to kill her.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.006
She wants me to kill them.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.975
Who do I side with?

27:56.008 --> 27:57.810
SWEATER BRIAN:
Why should you side
with anyone?

27:57.844 --> 27:59.712
I mean, who says
you have to commit murder?

27:59.746 --> 28:01.313
They do.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.982
They didn't give me an option
of not killing anyone.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.383
BADASS BRIAN:
Exactly.

28:04.416 --> 28:05.718
That's why there's not
even a question here.

28:05.752 --> 28:08.120
You dance with the one
that brung ya.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.455
And that is Eddie.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.490
Piper says she'll create
the enzyme soon.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.792
She says she didn't
kill her boyfriend.

28:12.825 --> 28:13.960
But you don't know.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.128
The only thing
you do know

28:16.162 --> 28:18.164
is that Eddie Morra
can help you.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.799
That's for certain.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.267
REBECCA:
I'm pretty sure
about one thing.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.502
You're not a killer.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.137
SANDS:
No one's a killer.

28:25.171 --> 28:28.274
Not until they kill, that is.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.042
What are those things
you're wearing?

28:30.076 --> 28:33.479
All right, obviously I'm having
a hard time with this.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.481
That's why you all
are showing up.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.284
So if I could just have
a little peace and quiet,

28:38.317 --> 28:39.952
I think that I...
IKE:
Excuse me?

28:39.986 --> 28:43.189
I'm not sure what
I'm doing here,

28:43.222 --> 28:44.857
but these things
really make me itchy.

28:44.891 --> 28:45.992
BADASS BRIAN:
Join Team Badass, Ike.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.994
You get cool
leather jackets.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.996
Leather sticks
to my skin.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.097
All right, enough!

28:53.032 --> 28:56.335
DENNIS:
Oh, you're making
this too hard, kid.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.871
There's no way
out of this.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.306
I mean, one way or another,

29:00.339 --> 29:03.075
I'm gonna be forced to do
something that I can't.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.511
And if I don't,
I'll die.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.380
And it'll blow back on you guys.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.083
Who do you believe?
What?

29:11.117 --> 29:13.252
That's the first thing
you're gonna have to decide.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.824
Is Senator Morra
a cold-blooded murderer,

29:17.857 --> 29:21.560
or did Piper Baird
kill her boyfriend?

29:21.593 --> 29:22.929
You're never gonna know,

29:22.962 --> 29:24.530
so you have to go
with what you feel.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.367
Decide who you believe.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.269
Side with them.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.939
And then you can
really start thinking.

29:44.516 --> 29:45.918
Brandy Jo Hawkins said

29:45.952 --> 29:48.921
she got NZT from
a meth dealer.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.923
When's the last time
someone below wholesale

29:50.957 --> 29:51.924
had a pill to sell?

29:51.958 --> 29:53.926
Mm...

29:53.960 --> 29:55.094
Maybe 18 months? Why?

29:55.127 --> 29:57.930
Something's wrong
with her story.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.065
Her blood test
confirmed

29:59.098 --> 30:00.933
that she had NZT in her system,

30:00.967 --> 30:01.767
but I ran a full battery

30:01.800 --> 30:03.069
and something else
came back, too.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.437
She has
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.906
It's fatal.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.075
It plays havoc
with your coordination.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.244
Yet she managed to get herself
into position,

30:12.278 --> 30:13.913
take an impossible shot,

30:13.946 --> 30:15.481
and avoid
every surveillance camera.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.283
So something's not sitting right
with you, either?

30:17.316 --> 30:18.885
Yeah, well...

30:18.918 --> 30:21.921
It's... she was so smart
along the way.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.390
Then, all of a sudden, bam!
(snaps fingers)

30:24.423 --> 30:25.524
An anonymous tip,
she's sitting

30:25.557 --> 30:27.226
right in our lap,
telling us everything.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.895
It just seems too easy.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.330
And you know what else?

30:31.363 --> 30:33.933
Her parents' house

30:33.966 --> 30:36.869
was in foreclosure
up until two days ago,

30:36.903 --> 30:38.404
right before
we picked her up.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.140
The bank settled,
supposedly an accounting error.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.075
Now it's theirs, free and clear.

30:43.109 --> 30:46.012
Well, what if someone settled
the debt against her house

30:46.045 --> 30:47.980
and in return,
she confessed to a crime

30:48.014 --> 30:49.615
she didn't commit?

30:49.648 --> 30:52.218
Because of her disease,
she'll be dead within the year.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.153
This way, she gets
to leave something

30:54.186 --> 30:55.922
for her family.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.523
If she's taking a fall...

30:57.556 --> 30:58.724
who's it for?

30:58.757 --> 31:02.995
And why would someone on NZT
be targeting Senator Morra?

31:03.029 --> 31:05.031
*

31:19.946 --> 31:23.315
*

31:23.349 --> 31:26.618
So, you believe me?

31:26.652 --> 31:30.022
Yeah, I believe you.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.424
I don't know if I trust you.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.394
PIPER: I came unarmed,
just like you asked.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.898
You know Morra says
you're psychotic?

31:41.033 --> 31:43.202
And yet, here we are.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.271
Yeah.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.106
You know what I think?

31:48.307 --> 31:49.708
I think you know
what needs to happen.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.310
And I think you know
you're the one to do it.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.146
You just need a little help
getting there.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.985
He'll take everything that means
anything to you, Brian.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.619
He'll do it and he'll say

32:00.652 --> 32:03.489
it had to happen
to make a better world.

32:05.224 --> 32:09.028
Would you take your hands
off me, please?

32:09.061 --> 32:10.462
What is that?

32:10.496 --> 32:11.497
You set me up?

32:11.530 --> 32:12.999
I'm sorry.
It was you or me.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.300
(gunshot)

32:14.333 --> 32:16.035
(tires screech)

32:42.028 --> 32:44.163
(grunting)

32:53.272 --> 32:55.074
(train horn blares)

33:00.512 --> 33:02.148
Wait, no.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.118
(screams):
No!

33:06.152 --> 33:07.486
(screams)

33:22.734 --> 33:25.804
SANDS:
We got hold of all
the security cam footage.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.807
No one saw your face.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.742
And...

33:30.776 --> 33:32.544
we had one of our people
from the NYPD

33:32.578 --> 33:35.814
pull that gun with your prints
off the scene.

33:35.847 --> 33:39.451
And there's no trace
of you being there.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.321
For a botched plan,

33:42.354 --> 33:44.356
it went quite well.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.261
Drink that.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.831
I killed her.

33:52.864 --> 33:56.268
We got a DNA sample.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.670
It was Piper Baird
on those tracks.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.040
What, you didn't think
we'd double-check your work?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.345
Believe it or not,
I know exactly

34:06.378 --> 34:10.216
what you're feeling
right now.

34:10.249 --> 34:13.352
Do you know what I did
after my first?

34:13.385 --> 34:16.322
I rang my year four teacher.

34:16.355 --> 34:20.159
Cried like I was one
of the Sabine women.

34:20.826 --> 34:23.162
Why her,
I don't know.

34:25.297 --> 34:28.334
Practically confessed.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.069
I'm lucky she didn't turn me in.

34:31.803 --> 34:35.441
How do you live with it...?

34:35.474 --> 34:37.443
All things pass, Brian.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.445
The volume of your feelings
right now?

34:39.478 --> 34:40.812
They'll go down.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.749
This is hard.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.351
But it's like a baptism.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.886
You're an initiate now.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.422
You're a part
of the real world.

34:50.456 --> 34:54.193
The strong eat the weak.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.099
Same as it ever was.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.542
(chatting indistinctly)

35:10.576 --> 35:12.278
All right, okay.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.180
You picked the wrong
day to come in late.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.548
Senator Morra came by to
thank us all personally.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.584
Oh, too bad I missed it.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.827
Goatwhore?

35:28.860 --> 35:31.530
Yeah.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.299
I liked them in high school.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.800
It freaks the people
around here out,

35:34.833 --> 35:37.636
so leave it up.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.438
I have a question for you.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.939
You don't have
to answer right now.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.874
But if you spend
some time with it,

35:42.908 --> 35:44.910
I think it might help you.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.555
Why are you trying
so hard to hold on

35:56.588 --> 35:58.490
to the person you were
before NZT?

35:58.524 --> 36:00.859
That's who I am.

36:00.892 --> 36:04.596
Well, it doesn't have to be.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.234
I remember Eddie Morra.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.868
He was a terrible writer.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.671
And he lacked the
self-discipline and awareness

36:12.704 --> 36:14.406
to do anything about it.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.776
I couldn't wait to get rid of
him and become somebody else.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.911
But you?

36:21.713 --> 36:24.950
We're different
from other people, Brian.

36:24.983 --> 36:28.487
We become more different
with every pill we take.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.658
You don't have
to run from that.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.226
You can embrace it.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.994
I don't want
to be someone else.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.430
I think you do.

36:38.464 --> 36:40.832
You're just not willing
to admit it yet.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.941
You're on NZT.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.279
You're above
the kind of concerns

36:53.312 --> 36:55.981
that you're letting
weigh you down.

36:56.014 --> 36:59.318
Put them down, walk away.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.820
You'll feel so much lighter.

37:01.853 --> 37:05.524
I promise.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.264
BRIAN:
No, I wasn't followed.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.932
I went exactly
the way you told me to--

37:13.965 --> 37:16.635
three cabs, two subways,
avoided every camera

37:16.668 --> 37:18.304
from Federal Plaza to here.

37:18.337 --> 37:19.971
Not easy to do,
by the way,

37:20.005 --> 37:21.773
in the most photographed city
in the world.

37:21.807 --> 37:25.611
Really not easy to do
without NZT.

37:25.644 --> 37:26.945
I know what you're thinking--

37:26.978 --> 37:28.680
"She's alive!"

37:28.714 --> 37:30.749
Also, hopefully, "I thought
for sure he'd killed her."

37:30.782 --> 37:32.318
Because let's be honest--

37:32.351 --> 37:34.353
you're not the person
we're trying to fool here.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.858
I'm not killing Eddie.

37:39.891 --> 37:40.992
I'm not killing anybody.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.728
And if you want to keep up
this war between you guys,

37:42.761 --> 37:43.995
then that's on you.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.298
But in the meantime,
I've got an idea.

37:46.332 --> 37:47.833
Luckily I know a lot

37:47.866 --> 37:48.867
about jumping
in front of subway trains,

37:48.900 --> 37:51.303
and she, disturbingly,
knows a thing or two

37:51.337 --> 37:52.938
about stealing cadavers
and rigging them

37:52.971 --> 37:54.039
under subway platforms.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.774
There was just one more thing.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.076
We were fairly certain Sands
would check the DNA

37:58.109 --> 38:01.880
of the body found at the scene
to be sure it matched Piper.

38:01.913 --> 38:04.916
Since we couldn't put
Piper's DNA into a dead body,

38:04.950 --> 38:06.818
I suggested we do it
the other way around--

38:06.852 --> 38:11.022
turn the body into Piper,
at least in the system.

38:18.364 --> 38:21.600
(train horn blares)
I also knew Sands would be
watching the whole time,

38:21.633 --> 38:24.503
so we'd have to make it
look perfect.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.538
(train horn blares)

38:27.473 --> 38:29.040
You should come away with me.

38:29.074 --> 38:30.609
I have a lab set up.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.944
I'm gonna figure out
how that enzyme works, Brian.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.882
You can be free
of Morra for good.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.351
The people I love
aren't gone yet.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.552
They're here.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.854
If I leave,

38:42.888 --> 38:45.891
I-I might as well
kill them myself.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.028
Can I give you some advice?

38:51.530 --> 38:53.365
Just drop this war with Morra.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.568
Figure out
how to make that shot,

38:56.602 --> 38:58.036
and live your life.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.138
You don't get it yet.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.641
If someone doesn't stop Morra,

39:02.674 --> 39:06.011
no one's gonna be able
to just "live their life."

39:06.044 --> 39:07.979
The whole world's
gonna be

39:08.013 --> 39:10.649
very different,
Brian.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.019
You can't play
both sides forever.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.660
You have to leave
the country now.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.662
Like we agreed.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.800
If Morra ever finds out
that you are still alive,

39:28.834 --> 39:32.103
then everything that means
anything to me is gone.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.547
You have a nice family.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.952
I hope I get to see you again,
under better circumstances.

39:48.887 --> 39:53.592
* When I was done dying,
my conscience regained *

39:53.625 --> 39:57.763
* So I began my struggle,
a nothingness strained *

39:57.796 --> 40:00.799
* Out a flash made of time
my new form blasted out *

40:00.832 --> 40:04.603
* And it startled me so
and I burst out a shout *

40:04.636 --> 40:08.106
* At which my legs ran frantic
like birds from a nest *

40:08.139 --> 40:11.777
* And I ran until drained
leaving no choice but rest *

40:11.810 --> 40:15.647
* So I fell asleep softly
at the edge of a cave *

40:15.681 --> 40:18.850
* But I should have gone deeper,
but I'm not so brave *

40:18.884 --> 40:22.220
* And like that I was torn out
and thrown in the sky *

40:22.253 --> 40:26.925
* And I said all my prayers
because surely I'll die *

40:26.958 --> 40:30.195
* As I crashed down and smashed
into earth, into dirt *

40:30.228 --> 40:33.198
* How my skin did explode
leaving only my shirt *

40:33.231 --> 40:35.834
* But from shirt grew a tree

40:35.867 --> 40:37.869
* And then tree grew a fruit,
and I... *
