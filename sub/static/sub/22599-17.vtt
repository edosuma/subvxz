[LAUGHING]

19:42.474 --> 19:45.060
Once a caveman, always a caveman.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.856
It always comes down
to bashing something with a rock.

19:49.106 --> 19:50.691
I'll crush you for that.

20:03.662 --> 20:05.664
Brains trump brute force, Kru'll.

[GROANS]

20:10.002 --> 20:14.256
Unh! Brute force. Mm! Wait a second.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.927
Skeets, dump your charge out.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.221
But, sir, I've been holding back.

What happened?

20:52.711 --> 20:54.963
Am I gonna live forever?

20:55.797 --> 20:57.216
You deluded creature.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.927
Still hoping to get something for nothing.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.430
Skeets. Speak to me, buddy.

21:06.934 --> 21:09.603
I knew you would save me, sir.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.314
I don't know what I'd do without you.

21:12.606 --> 21:15.192
Because, you know,
I need to make some calls...

21:15.442 --> 21:17.736
...and this ear bud's got like zero bars.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.406
I'm on it, sir.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.620
You'll get life for this.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.087
- I'm glad we could work together.
- Wow.

21:35.671 --> 21:38.799
My thoughts exactly.
And there's a lesson to be learned.

21:39.091 --> 21:41.468
You were a hero
because you ignored the glory...

21:41.718 --> 21:43.553
...and remembered
what mattered most was--

BOOSTER:
Just a sec.

21:44.805 --> 21:46.348
Manny, call the toy company.

21:46.598 --> 21:48.392
I teamed up with Batman,
and guess what.

21:48.642 --> 21:49.810
We won.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.271
I know. Huh?

21:52.521 --> 21:53.522
News crews?

21:53.772 --> 21:56.858
What do you mean
there has to be a camera?

21:56.858 --> 21:59.695
Stupid 21st century media.

21:59.945 --> 22:04.116
Until we meet again, Booster Gold.

Wait. You remind me of somebody I met
years and years ago.

22:16.712 --> 22:19.423
Just a sec. Second floor's almost clear.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.342
Yeah? Tell me that when I'm famous.

22:23.302 --> 22:25.262
You.
