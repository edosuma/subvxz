ARE THICKENED,

YOU COMPROMISE THE BLOOD FLOW.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.166
BLOOD CLOTS, HEART FAILURE,
IMMUNE SYSTEM--

09:29.208 --> 09:31.375
EACH OF WHICH HAVE OCCURRED IN
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.250
IT'S CALLED SURGERY.
WHAT YOU THINK IS MOOT,
MONTGOMERY,

09:45.291 --> 09:48.041
BECAUSE LEAH HUDLEY NO LONGER
WANTS YOU AS HER DOCTOR.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.041
SHE WANTS IN ON HIS TRIAL.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.625
(retches)

09:51.667 --> 09:53.250
MM.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.041
IT SEEMS YOU MAKE HER SICK.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.000
(scoffs and laughs)

10:04.000 --> 10:06.041
YOU WANT TO LEAVE
THOSE FILES?

10:06.083 --> 10:08.041
IF LEAH HUDLEY
WANTS HER FILES,

10:08.083 --> 10:10.333
SHE CAN COME TO ME
AND GET THEM.

10:10.375 --> 10:13.041
YOU KNOW, CHARLOTTE SAID
YOU WERE BRILLIANT.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.250
SHE DIDN'T SAY
YOU WERE THIS HOT.

10:19.583 --> 10:22.583
I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS. YOU
HAVE TO TALK HIM OFF THE LEDGE.

10:22.625 --> 10:25.041
WELL, HE WANTS WHAT HE WANTS.
WELL, THAT'S
THE ATHLETE'S MENTALITY.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.041
THEIR ENTIRE SELF-WORTH
IS WRAPPED UP IN WINNING.

10:27.083 --> 10:29.875
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE BOXERS
WHO COME OUT OF RETIREMENT

10:29.917 --> 10:32.041
AND END UP WITH BRAIN DAMAGE.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.542
THEY--THEY DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO STOP.
AND SINCE WHEN DO YOU
CARE SO MUCH ABOUT CYCLING?

10:34.583 --> 10:37.041
I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE.
NAOMI.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.917
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO RIDE A BIKE?
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

10:39.959 --> 10:42.917
THE POINT IS, HE'S GONNA RACE,
AND IF WE DON'T FIX HIS KNEE,

10:42.959 --> 10:47.083
HE'S GONNA FIND
SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WILL.
(Pete) YEAH,
AT LEAST WITH US, WE KNOW.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.709
WE CAN GIVE HIM HIS BEST SHOT
AT WINNING AND SURVIVING.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.041
ARROGANT, INSUFFERABLE...

10:51.083 --> 10:52.250
CHARLOTTE?

10:52.291 --> 10:55.709
WYATT LOCKHART.
HE'S WORKING DOWNSTAIRS NOW.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.125
AND HE TRIED TO POACH
ONE OF MY PATIENTS.

10:58.166 --> 11:01.166
YEAH, I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF
A DOCTOR DOES THAT,

11:01.208 --> 11:03.041
STEALS PATIENTS?

11:03.083 --> 11:05.041
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE HE'S SOME
AMBULANCE-CHASING LAWYER.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.417
(knocks on doorjamb)

11:06.458 --> 11:08.792
CAN I SEE EVERYONE
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM?

11:08.834 --> 11:11.000
I HAVE AN IDEA
TO HELP THE PRACTICE.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.041
ADOPTION.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.542
ADOPTION AGENCIES ARE
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, DELL.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.542
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
AN ADOPTION AGENCY.

11:18.583 --> 11:21.041
I'M TALKING ABOUT A FEE-BASED
SERVICE MATCHING UP MOTHERS

11:21.083 --> 11:23.041
WHO ALREADY WANT TO GIVE
THEIR BABIES UP FOR ADOPTION

11:23.083 --> 11:25.041
WITH PERSPECTIVE PARENTS.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.208
WE CAN HELP OUR PATIENTS
ALREADY FAILING AT FERTILITY.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.583
OFFER THEM AN IN-HOUSE
ALTERNATIVE TO START A FAMILY.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.417
ADOPTION ISN'T SOMETHING YOU
JUST OFFER WHEN FERTILITY FAILS.

11:32.458 --> 11:35.166
IF THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN UP
ON WANTING A BIOLOGICAL CHILD,

11:35.208 --> 11:38.041
THEN THEY SHOULD NOT DO IT.
WHICH IS WHY WE'D HAVE
A STRICT PROTOCOL FOR THAT.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.792
VIOLET'S ALREADY LICENSED

11:39.834 --> 11:42.375
TO SCREEN BIRTH MOTHERS
AND PERSPECTIVE PARENTS.

11:42.417 --> 11:45.208
AND ONCE THE CHILD IS BORN,
COOPER HAS A NEW PATIENT.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHERE DO WE
FIND THE BIRTH MOTHERS?

11:45.250 --> 11:49.041
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT US
ALL OUT THERE RECRUITING.
WE WON'T RECRUIT.
ALL WE NEED IS ONE TEST CASE.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.208
WHERE WILL WE FIND
THIS TEST CASE?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.750
ACTUALLY, MY PATIENT--
MY PATIENT--JUDY

11:53.792 --> 11:56.166
WANTS TO GIVE HER BABY UP FOR
ADOPTION AND HAS ASKED FOR HELP.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.166
AND YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE
DESPERATE TO ADOPT,

11:58.208 --> 12:00.667
THE SINCLAIRS.
YES, YES, I HAVE SCREENED
THE SINCLAIRS,

12:00.709 --> 12:03.041
BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN MET
YOUR PATIENT.
I'LL BRING HER IN.
YOU'LL LOVE HER.

12:03.083 --> 12:06.041
IF WE DON'T DO THIS,
SOMEONE ELSE WILL,

12:06.083 --> 12:08.000
MAYBE DOWN ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.667
HEY.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.667
IS MEG STILL OUT OF TOWN?

12:16.709 --> 12:18.041
YEAH. WHY?

12:18.083 --> 12:20.667
A FRIEND OF MINE OFFERED ME
TWO TICKETS TO THE SYMPHONY.

12:20.709 --> 12:22.667
ANY INTEREST IN GOING?
YOU'RE NOT TAKING COOP?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.667
OH. AND LISTEN TO HIM
MOAN ABOUT CHARLOTTE?

12:24.709 --> 12:27.667
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WOULD
LOVE TO, BUT I SHOULDN'T.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.208
I GOTTA STUDY
RAY'S CONDITION.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.250
MAYBE I CAN DO SOMETHING
TO HELP HIS HEART.
ALONE AGAIN.

12:32.291 --> 12:35.041
HEY, I KNOW
WHO YOU COULD ASK.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.959
(laughs)

12:37.000 --> 12:39.041
YOU HAVE A SECRET ADMIRER.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.041
SOMEONE LIKING ME
IS FUNNY?

12:41.083 --> 12:43.041
NO, JUST THE GUY...

12:43.083 --> 12:44.834
THIS WEIRD SHRINK
FROM DOWNSTAIRS--

12:44.875 --> 12:47.125
SHELDON?
SHELDON'S INTERESTED IN ME?

12:47.166 --> 12:49.291
YOU WOULDN'T
GO OUT WITH HIM?

12:49.333 --> 12:52.083
HE'S FROM THE FOURTH FLOOR,
THE ENEMY.

12:52.125 --> 12:55.125
YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE I'VE HAD A DATE, PETE?

12:55.166 --> 12:59.542
(car alarm chirps)

13:02.083 --> 13:03.041
(sighs)

13:03.083 --> 13:04.291
CHARLOTTE.

13:04.333 --> 13:07.041
(gasps) OH. YOU ALMOST
GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.375
HOW YOU FEELING?
I'M ON THE PILL.

13:09.417 --> 13:12.041
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT 100%.
COOPER, I WOULD KNOW
IF I WAS PREGNANT.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.250
I AM NOT PREGNANT.
YOU'RE CRANKY.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.166
I'M ALWAYS CRANKY.
YOU'RE GLOWING.

13:16.208 --> 13:18.041
I'M ALWAYS GLOWING.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.041
NOW PLEASE...

13:20.083 --> 13:23.834
STOP STALKING ME
AND MY WOMB.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.458
(man) RECEIVE NOT ONE,
BUT TWO--

13:27.500 --> 13:30.667
(man) ...POLICE OF RACISM...
IF I HAVE TO WATCH
ANOTHER EPISODE OF "COPS,"

13:30.709 --> 13:33.041
I'M GONNA SHOOT YOUR TV
AND MY BRAINS OUT.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.125
YEAH, WELL, WE WOULDN'T
WANT TO DO THAT.

13:35.166 --> 13:38.166
YOU'D RUIN
MY 1,000-COUNT SHEETS.
CAN'T YOU WRITE ME
A DOCTOR'S NOTE,

13:38.208 --> 13:41.166
GET ME BACK OUT THERE?
YOU ARE ON BED REST.
THAT MEANS BED AND REST.

13:41.208 --> 13:43.041
(groans)
COME ON.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.333
I HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE

13:44.375 --> 13:46.333
WITH MY PATIENTS
NOT LISTENING TO ME.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.750
YOU...
ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO ME.

13:48.792 --> 13:49.959
(chuckles)

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
MM.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.709
THAT'LL GET ME THROUGH
ANOTHER DAY.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.041
(laughs) MM.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.834
(sighs)

14:02.083 --> 14:04.041
I'M SUDDENLY NERVOUS.
NAOMI'S JUST CHECKING
WITH THE SINCLAIRS

14:04.083 --> 14:05.291
AND OUR LAWYERS.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.291
I'M SURE
IT'LL ALL BE GOOD.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.041
YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT VIOLET?
IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME...

14:10.083 --> 14:11.542
YOU'LL BE GREAT, OKAY?

14:11.583 --> 14:14.333
SHE JUST NEEDS TO KNOW THAT YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

14:14.375 --> 14:17.000
THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
WITH IT.
YEAH, WELL, WHAT DO I SAY?

14:17.041 --> 14:19.041
UH, JUST TELL HER ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS

14:19.083 --> 14:22.959
AND ABOUT THE BABY
AND YOUR FUTURE.
LIKE WHAT? I MEAN, IF I
TELL HER THE WRONG THING--

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
TELL HER YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
THIS A LOT, THAT YOU KNOW

14:26.041 --> 14:28.834
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
AND THAT IT'LL BE HARD,

14:28.875 --> 14:32.041
BUT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE BABY IS
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT FOR YOU.
OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT. WHAT ELSE?

14:32.083 --> 14:35.000
WELL, SHE'LL ASK IF YOU'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT FEEL

14:35.041 --> 14:37.000
IN A FEW YEARS
IF YOUR SITUATION IMPROVES

14:37.041 --> 14:39.667
AND SOMEONE ELSE
IS RAISING YOUR CHILD.
WELL, HOW DO I ANSWER THAT?

14:39.709 --> 14:42.667
JUST, YOU KNOW, SAY THAT IT--
IT WOULD BE HARD, BUT...

14:42.709 --> 14:45.041
(sighs) YOU WANT THIS BABY
TO HAVE PARENTS

14:45.083 --> 14:46.959
THAT CAN GIVE IT EVERYTHING,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.583
AND YOU LOVE HIM SO MUCH,
YOU WOULD NEVER TAKE THAT AWAY.

14:49.625 --> 14:52.041
IT'S A MOTHER'S SACRIFICE.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.041
HI.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.375
HI. (clears throat)

14:54.417 --> 14:56.041
YOU READY, JUDY?

14:56.083 --> 14:57.875
UM, YEAH.
I'M--I'M READY.

14:57.917 --> 14:59.000
OKAY.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.041
YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN THEM
MY FILE.

15:05.083 --> 15:10.041
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
YOU DIDN'T RETURN MY CALLS.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
I'M CHOOSING TO GO ELSEWHERE,
DR. MONTGOMERY.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.458
THAT'S MY RIGHT.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.041
I JUST WANT TO BE SURE--
I DIDN'T PLAN
FOR THE PERFECT DRESS,

15:16.083 --> 15:18.667
THE PERFECT RING,
THE PERFECT WEDDING.

15:18.709 --> 15:22.333
I PLANNED FOR THIS.
THIS IS ALL I'VE WANTED.

15:22.375 --> 15:25.041
I SET UP MY CAREER FOR THIS,

15:25.083 --> 15:28.041
TO BE ABLE TO BE A SINGLE MOM
WHO CAN PROVIDE FOR A BABY.

15:28.083 --> 15:31.625
IT MAY NOT BE CONVENTIONAL,
AND IT MAY NOT BE THE EASY WAY,

15:31.667 --> 15:34.625
(voice breaks) BUT IT'S
THE WAY I WANTED.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.625
(normal voice)
IT'S WHAT I PLANNED FOR.

15:36.667 --> 15:40.917
AND WITH DR. LOCKHART,
I HAVE SHOT.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.917
CAN YOU OFFER ME THAT?

15:42.959 --> 15:44.959
I CAN GET RID OF THE CANCER.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.959
SO CAN HE.
AND I NEED BOTH.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.458
I HOPE IT WORKS
FOR YOU, LEAH.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.041
I REALLY DO.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.375
THANK YOU.

16:12.542 --> 16:15.000
(elevator bell dings)

16:18.750 --> 16:21.667
(man speaking indistinctly)

16:21.709 --> 16:23.208
BYE.

16:27.458 --> 16:30.041
HEY, SHELDON.
OH! OH, I'M SORRY.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.166
OH, I'M SO SORRY. I--
NO. NO, NO, NO,
THAT WAS ME.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.959
(laughs)

16:34.000 --> 16:36.041
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU,
VIOLET. I...

16:36.083 --> 16:38.959
OUR LITTLE BREAKFAST BUFFET
SEEMS TO BE QUIET POPULAR

16:39.000 --> 16:40.291
WITH THE FIFTH FLOOR.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.959
UM, CLINICALLY SPEAKING,
DO YOU THINK THAT'S, UH, ENVY

16:43.000 --> 16:44.291
OR THE LOBSTER?

16:44.333 --> 16:47.125
MY DIAGNOSIS IS MORE...
CURIOSITY

16:47.166 --> 16:50.208
AND THE SMOKED SALMON.
WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH ME?

16:50.250 --> 16:52.000
(laughs) I'M SORRY.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.041
THAT WAS MEANT TO HAVE CHARM
AND BUILDUP

16:54.083 --> 16:57.500
AND A CLEVER TURN OF PHRASE.
I'D LOVE TO.

16:57.542 --> 16:59.000
REALLY?

17:00.625 --> 17:03.375
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN
GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

17:03.417 --> 17:06.041
WE'VE FOUND TWO BIRTH MOTHERS.

17:06.083 --> 17:09.750
LAST TIME, I'D EVEN PICKED OUT
BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS.

17:09.792 --> 17:12.041
THEY HAD THESE...
STUPID LITTLE TURTLES ON 'EM.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.041
WE SPENT MONTHS
GETTING OUR HOPES UP,

17:14.083 --> 17:16.125
AND WE NEVER EVEN
GOT TO MEET THE BABY.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.125
THE FATHER HAS ALREADY
SIGNED-OFF ON THE ADOPTION,

17:18.166 --> 17:20.125
AND--AND VIOLET HAS
INTERVIEWED THE BIRTH MOTHER.

17:20.166 --> 17:23.125
I'M VERY IMPRESSED
BY HER MATURITY.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.542
SHE REALLY THINKS ADOPTION IS
THE BEST THING FOR HER BABY.

17:26.583 --> 17:29.166
I THINK THIS TIME
WILL BE DIFFERENT.
OKAY.

17:32.041 --> 17:35.875
UH, MATT, CARRIE...

17:35.917 --> 17:37.250
THIS IS JUDY.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.041
HI.
HI.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.041
UM, DELL SAYS
THAT YOU'RE BOTH LAWYERS.

17:42.083 --> 17:46.041
UH, YES, BUT DON'T
HOLD THAT AGAINST US.
(all laugh)

17:46.083 --> 17:48.041
WHY DON'T WE GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO TALK?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.375
THANKS.

17:49.417 --> 17:51.041
THANKS.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.709
(lowered voice)
THIS MAY WORK. NICE JOB, DELL.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.709
(Carrie) SO ARE YOU IN SCHOOL?

17:55.750 --> 17:57.917
YES. UH, YES, I'M IN
MY THIRD YEAR RIGHT NOW.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.041
OH.
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
CONGRATULATIONS.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.291
THANKS.

18:02.333 --> 18:05.041
OH. SORRY.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.166
I WAS GRABBING SOMETHING
FOR RAY.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.667
HEY. ARE YOU OKAY?

18:09.709 --> 18:11.041
YEAH. NO.

18:11.083 --> 18:14.041
(sighs) LEAH HUDLEY
WOULDN'T LISTEN.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.041
SHE'S STICKING WITH LOCKHART.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.333
I DON'T MIND LOSING A PATIENT
TO A DOCTOR,

18:18.375 --> 18:20.333
BUT WHEN SOMEONE
STEALS A PATIENT

18:20.375 --> 18:22.959
BY GIVING THEM FALSE HOPE...

18:23.000 --> 18:25.041
THAT'S DESPICABLE.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.041
ANYWAY...

18:27.083 --> 18:29.333
HEY, MAN, 10 MILES
ON THE BIKE, NO PAIN.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.125
HEART'S LOOKING GOOD.

18:31.166 --> 18:33.875
WISH ME LUCK TOMORROW.

18:33.917 --> 18:37.041
DON'T RACE, RAY.
I'M GONNA WIN.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.041
I'M GONNA GET MONICA
THE MONEY WE NEED,

18:39.083 --> 18:41.333
AND I'M GONNA BE FINE.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.333
YOU FIXED ME.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.542
(elevator bell dings)

19:04.333 --> 19:07.125
LOOK, I'M NOT THE ENEMY.

19:07.166 --> 19:10.458
THE PATIENT CHOSE ME.
THAT HAPPENS.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.500
LET ME BUY YOU DINNER.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.542
ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO GO,
MY TREAT.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.542
OR WE COULD JUST SKIP DINNER
AND GO TO MY PLACE.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.041
(scoffs)

19:19.083 --> 19:20.291
UNBELIEVABLE.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.500
WHAT? I'M TRYING
TO BE NICE, MONTY.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.417
IT'S MONTGOMERY.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.041
(ding)

19:27.083 --> 19:29.041
