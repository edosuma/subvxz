Grace

00:49.883 --> 00:51.551
Ah.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.929
-She is not who you think she is!

00:55.055 --> 00:57.098
Sheree. She's a grifter.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.892
What are you talking about?

00:59.476 --> 01:01.728
Here's what she can do
with her three-year lease!

01:02.395 --> 01:04.355
What the hell? Frankie!

01:04.439 --> 01:05.690
I was just up in my...

01:05.774 --> 01:08.151
excuse me, Sheree's studio,

01:08.276 --> 01:11.279
the new decor of which
I have a lot of questions about,

01:11.362 --> 01:12.530
but that's for another time.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.365
What were you doing in her studio?

01:14.449 --> 01:17.660
What I do best. Getting buzzed
and outing your roommate.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.496
She is not gay.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.039
But you are buzzed.

01:21.122 --> 01:26.085
No, she's a grifter, a con,
a mack daddy, a bag bitch.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.837
Frankie, she's a manicurist.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.672
How do you know that?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.508
Because she paints my nails!

01:31.633 --> 01:35.261
And did you know she's also trying
to steal her dead husband's house

01:35.345 --> 01:36.930
from her stepkids?

01:37.013 --> 01:38.848
She doesn't have stepkids.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.975
You know who talks like that, Grace?

01:41.142 --> 01:45.563
A mark, a rube, a patsy, a stooge, a mugu.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.273
That last one is made up.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.150
Just what a mugu would say.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.320
And for your information,
she does have stepchildren.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.155
This is none of your business.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.990
You're my business.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.077
She's not to be trusted.
I've got the goods on her!

01:59.160 --> 02:01.538
Let's go! Let's go!
The games are about to begin!

02:01.621 --> 02:02.580
Let it go, Frankie.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.999
Is this really what you want to be doing
right now?

02:05.166 --> 02:08.128
Shouldn't you be wanting to know
the sex of your first grandchild?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.712
I can multitask.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.841
You can't. You're famous
for not being able to multitask.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.300
You can't even task.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.221
I'm sorry, I was thinking
about the other thing. What did you say?

02:22.058 --> 02:22.892
Mm.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.103
Mm.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.355
If I wasn't already pregnant
with Bud's baby,

02:27.480 --> 02:29.357
I'd want to give birth
to Sheree's muffins.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.358
They are good.

02:30.984 --> 02:31.943
You had one?

02:32.569 --> 02:33.945
I did not have "one."

02:34.487 --> 02:35.905
-Let's do this.

02:35.989 --> 02:41.244
Okay! Today, we all get to find out
the gender of our baby.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.621
If a placenta is involved, I'm out.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.499
-No, that's the placenta planting party.
-I'm not going to that one.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.585
-Yeah, I've got a thing, too.
-I can make it.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.587
Let's get on with it, people! I said that way too loudly!

02:52.714 --> 02:55.758
Welcome to the scaven-gender hunt.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.219
That was good.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.470
Thank you, Barry.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.265
The game: You get a riddle.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.851
When you figure it out,
it becomes a clue,

03:04.934 --> 03:08.563
which takes you to an object,
which becomes another riddle,

03:08.646 --> 03:11.983
which will take you to the last clue,
which will take you to the last object,

03:12.066 --> 03:14.527
which has the answer to the big question.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.405
Or we could just call your doctor
and find out.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.823
Allison, what's your last name?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.575
Giampietro-Smikowitz.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.744
-Perfect.
-But it won't work.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.371
Our doctor respects the hunt.
We set up a safe word.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.749
Any other questions?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.584
What's the safe word?

03:29.667 --> 03:30.543
Grifter.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.295
Now, here's the most important part.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.047
We don't know the sex either,

03:34.130 --> 03:37.550
so we don't get to find out
until you all do.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.677
You ready?
-Yeah!

03:39.802 --> 03:42.055
-Okay.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.640
All right.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.266
"Why is..."

03:45.350 --> 03:47.101
"...the baby strawberry crying?"

03:47.185 --> 03:48.394
Oh, dear lord.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.313
Because she had to play this stupid game?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.565
This is way fun.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.275
Because you're good at solving riddles.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.570
I know, but it's because
there's tons of them in<i> Highlights.</i>

03:57.654 --> 03:59.530
I've been training for this my whole life.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.451
And where are you going?

04:03.576 --> 04:05.453
Tears are salty,

04:05.578 --> 04:09.040
so... maybe it's on the beach.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.584
-Let's do it.
-Yeah!

04:12.710 --> 04:15.213
-Okay.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.007
Come on, Robert. I'll help you up.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.510
No, this is a young man's game. You go.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.432
Do you know where there are strawberries?

04:27.058 --> 04:28.643
Not in the studio.

04:28.726 --> 04:32.563
-The studio, you say. Interesting.
-You are not going there. Fine. After seeing the decor,
my retinas need a rest anyway.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.362
And besides,
I have the names of her stepkids,

04:39.445 --> 04:42.573
and I can just call Arnold and Patricia.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.117
You are not calling anyone.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.369
You are not the boss of my calls.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.747
We agreed after the last phone bill
that I am the boss of your calls.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.254
How's the anger coming?

04:56.337 --> 04:58.298
Mm, going down smooth.

04:58.881 --> 05:02.051
Look, you have a little tiny scowl.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.721
Don't break that.
Sheree worked very hard on me.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.516
Did Frankie tell you what we found out
about her? It's pretty juicy.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.475
What did she find out?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.144
Well, why don't you ask her yourself

05:11.227 --> 05:14.522
and enjoy the Miss Marple gibberish
that comes out of her mouth.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.775
I don't know, Mom.
We read some really fucked up stuff.

05:17.900 --> 05:22.405
And I just have to say... I need
a grilled cheese. And I mean, right now.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.616
If you tell me what's going on,
I will make you a grilled cheese.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.909
There's no time.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.537
Why don't you take after your mother
and drink

05:29.662 --> 05:32.498
instead of smoking doobies
with your burnout Aunt Frankie?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.335
All I'm saying is that I would want
to know about my roommate

05:35.418 --> 05:37.086
before I signed a lease with her.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.922
What is this so-called fucked up stuff
you two found?

05:40.006 --> 05:43.593
Exactly. What is it

05:44.177 --> 05:46.345
Who are you

05:46.429 --> 05:48.264
And who is Sheree?

05:48.347 --> 05:49.474
Jeez.

05:49.557 --> 05:50.433
Jam.

05:50.975 --> 05:51.893
What?

05:52.810 --> 05:55.980
The baby strawberry was crying
because its parents were in a jam.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.694
That dumb game

06:13.790 --> 06:16.584
-Good morning.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.919
Not even close.

06:18.002 --> 06:18.878
Good night.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.257
Oh, boy.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.719
Looks like it's sneakers,
not slippers, tonight.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.055
John and his friends
are going back to the mall.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.974
They want to make some noise
during closing time.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.852
And get some See's candy.

06:34.936 --> 06:39.065
No, I can't. I mean, yes to the candy,
but no to the rest of it.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.983
What are you talking about?

06:41.943 --> 06:43.986
I'm not sure I can do this anymore.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.114
But this is our thing now.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.200
It's been our thing
for the last six months.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.410
Maybe we need a new thing.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.745
I thought you liked it.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.580
I did, in the beginning.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.917
But I love being out there
on the front line with you.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.378
It's energizing, it's exciting.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.132
I thought it was making us feel closer.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.802
Yes, but it's also making me feel
closer to death.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.470
You don't mean that.

07:09.554 --> 07:13.182
Honey, I have not been able
to feel my feet for three weeks.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.644
I don't even know if they're still there.
Are they still there?

07:17.019 --> 07:18.396
Yes, they're still there.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.231
Put them here.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.442
Oh, yes.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.445
I'll even buy you a chocolate lolly.
You'll be fine.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.992
I'll be fine because I won't be going
with you tonight.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.911
Are you okay with that?

07:34.620 --> 07:35.621
Yeah, sure.

07:35.997 --> 07:36.956
Mm.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.544
You're hurting me. Right.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.465
Um... Ow.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.799
How was your flight?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.926
It was good
until one of the engines caught fire

07:49.051 --> 07:51.554
and we had to do an emergency landing
in Ontario.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.889
You're in Canada?

07:53.014 --> 07:56.267
San Bernardino. I rented a car,
so I'm going to be even later.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.019
Well, just get here safely.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.897
<i>Well, I'll try,</i>
<i>but all the rental company had left</i>

08:00.980 --> 08:05.151
was a car made in the former Yugoslavia
called an "85 Tibor."

08:05.234 --> 08:07.028
-Oh, fancy.
<i>-Very.</i>

08:07.111 --> 08:10.531
The guy says it runs fine as long
as I don't drive more than 40 hectares

08:10.615 --> 08:12.200
without tightening the bolts.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.578
But you're 30,000 hectares away!
And what--

08:16.037 --> 08:17.121
-Hey!

08:17.205 --> 08:18.039
Frankie?

08:18.122 --> 08:20.833
<i> Mrs. Davis,</i>
<i>please report to the courtesy van.</i>

08:21.584 --> 08:23.794
-Jacob!

08:23.878 --> 08:25.588
Not Sheree's stepkids?

08:25.671 --> 08:28.174
How can I talk to people who don't exist?

08:28.257 --> 08:30.051
But it's never stopped you before.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.762
Okay, first things first,
when Jacob gets here,

08:32.845 --> 08:35.389
you need to tell him
that you're the one who hung up on him

08:35.556 --> 08:38.226
and it wasn't my earring this time.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.810
And B, give me my phone back.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.230
Yeah, so you can call Arnold and Patricia?

08:42.313 --> 08:45.775
I don't need to call anyone.
I'm blowing this thing up from the inside.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.109
Ooh...

08:47.193 --> 08:48.736
"What the hell does that mean?"

08:48.819 --> 08:50.321
Oh, you'll find out.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.951
-God damn it.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.213
-Mm.
-Oh, God.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.256
Apricot.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.423
Strawberry.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.800
What's it say?

09:11.259 --> 09:13.302
"What is brown and sticky?"

09:13.386 --> 09:14.470
Ew.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.223
Brown and sticky... Brown and sticky...
Brown and sticky...

09:17.306 --> 09:19.559
-Don't overthink it.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.727
Why are we the only ones
pretending to care about this?

09:21.811 --> 09:22.770
It's a stick!

09:26.148 --> 09:27.149
Yes.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.027
Yeah. Okay.

09:31.028 --> 09:33.614
Barry, where have you been?

09:33.698 --> 09:36.200
You missed the next clue! It's "stick"!

09:36.784 --> 09:38.578
-I don't know what that means.
-Correct.

09:38.661 --> 09:43.374
Actually, I was just on the phone
with Lauren from Natural Faces.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.834
Oh.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.754
Well, what did Bore-en
from Natural Feces have to say?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.715
She said, "You got the job."

09:51.549 --> 09:52.592
Oh...

09:53.175 --> 09:54.051
Well.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.222
Oh, did she low
How low did her balls go?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.975
Actually, it's more money
than you paid me.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.184
By a lot.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.896
-She's good.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.816
I love that you even asked me
that question.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.901
-Take it.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.404
Yeah. It's a good job,
and you should have one of those.

10:13.487 --> 10:16.032
Although, if they call me for a reference,

10:16.115 --> 10:18.492
I'm gonna have to tell them
that you fucked your boss.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.251
Where'd you find it?

10:27.335 --> 10:28.377
In a dog's mouth.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.962
Here's the clue. You guys ready?

10:30.379 --> 10:32.340
"At a wedding, you share me.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.051
In a urinal, you pee on me.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.344
What am I?"

10:37.928 --> 10:40.306
That is a horrible, horrible riddle.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.058
It's the last clue. We went big.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.976
What do you share at a wedding?

10:44.060 --> 10:46.562
The garter

10:46.646 --> 10:47.897
Porridge!

10:47.980 --> 10:50.107
I went to a wedding once
where we all shared porridge.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.443
They're divorced now.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.446
Cake.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.781
Is it cake?

10:56.864 --> 10:57.782
Ha-ha!

10:57.865 --> 10:58.866
It's cake?

11:02.995 --> 11:06.749
Well, let's cut the cake and find out.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.459
Oh!

11:08.542 --> 11:11.253
This is a horrible, horrible party.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.801
Hey.

11:18.761 --> 11:22.098
So, now that I have a clearer head
and a belly full of grilled cheese parts,

11:22.223 --> 11:24.975
I just want to say I'm proud of you
that you got the job.

11:25.059 --> 11:29.105
I don't want you to take it
because it's gonna make me crazy.

11:29.688 --> 11:32.108
-And you don't want to do that.
-No, I don't.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.067
Good.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.985
But I already took the job.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.821
Oh.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.697
You told me to take the job.

11:39.156 --> 11:40.116
Okay.

11:40.199 --> 11:44.870
Yeah, but I was hoping you would know
that what I told you

11:44.954 --> 11:47.540
was the complete opposite
of what I was telling you.

11:48.999 --> 11:52.545
I told you that I hate her.
I told you that she's my nemesis.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.588
Because you both wore a purple shirt?

11:54.755 --> 11:57.133
It was a yellow skirt.
And that's not why I hate her.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.718
Do you know that she said in an article

11:59.802 --> 12:02.888
that the only reason I got my job was
because my mother feels sorry for me?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.349
What? That's awful.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.644
Now I hate her, too.
You really should have told me that.

12:08.727 --> 12:12.064
Only if I wanted you to do
what I really wanted you to do

12:12.148 --> 12:14.066
and not what I said I wanted you to do.

12:14.942 --> 12:19.488
Okay, now I'm lost again.
Look, do you want me to un

12:19.572 --> 12:20.614
No. Well, yes.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.244
No. I'm not going to ask you to do that.

12:25.327 --> 12:29.373
Take the job if you're okay
with working for someone that I hate.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.959
I can probably make that work.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.878
Congratulations.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.337
Well, thank you.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.300
Can you put on the yellow skirt later

12:42.136 --> 12:43.971
And together we can be a Laker girl?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.184
Cake. Cake. Cake.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.312
-Blue cake...
-Boy.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.897
-And pink cake...
-Girl.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.733
We get it! Come on, rip that fucker open!

13:00.654 --> 13:03.073
Okay. All right.

13:06.869 --> 13:07.995
Oh.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.332
Huh.

13:11.415 --> 13:15.002
-It's the color of my shirt.

13:15.794 --> 13:16.712
Yes.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.715
Cut another slice.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.013
Maybe natural light will help.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.350
It still looks purple to me.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.353
Hey, all. So sorry I'm late.

13:32.436 --> 13:35.231
Oh, Jacob. You're here!

13:35.898 --> 13:38.108
What gender is this?

13:38.192 --> 13:40.194
Uh...

13:40.319 --> 13:41.403
I'll call my doctor.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.365
Although I'm not sure I can remember
what the safe word is.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.116
Why do I feel like it's "grifter"?

13:46.200 --> 13:50.287
I'm sorry. I blew it. I promised
to throw you all an amazing party,

13:50.412 --> 13:53.040
and I nailed it... up until this moment.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.667
What's amazing is you're having a baby!

13:54.750 --> 13:58.921
And it doesn't matter what he/she is.
He/she's yours.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.839
And when he/she is on his/her way,

14:00.923 --> 14:04.301
you better call me
so that I/she can get here in time.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.304
-Mom, I promise you won't miss anything.
-Aw.

14:12.059 --> 14:15.646
Hey, do I get a prize
because I solved the most riddles?

14:16.272 --> 14:17.273
-Yeah.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.315
-Of course.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.817
-Come on, yeah.
-I get a prize!

14:19.900 --> 14:21.235
You know what you get?

14:21.944 --> 14:24.530
The better part of a dozen eggs!

14:24.613 --> 14:26.699
-Ah!

14:26.782 --> 14:27.658
Oh!

14:27.741 --> 14:29.243
-The brown kind.
-Mm-hmm.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.249
Thanks for the lift.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.458
Anytime.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.003
Hey, take your eggs.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.087
Oh.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.757
Hey, my egg holder
only has room for two eggs.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.302
Do you mind storing the rest
in your normal

14:46.385 --> 14:48.512
-Sure. I will take them to my apartment.
-Awesome.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.889
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.557
-Have a good night.
-You, too.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.976
Whoa.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.897
Huh.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.399
It's like a shiny penis.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.320
Sorry. Seeing that can't be easy.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.323
It's not. It's infuriating.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.577
As a matter of fact...

15:20.085 --> 15:20.920
Um...

15:27.843 --> 15:29.803
That feels
really, really, really, really good.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.643
Hmm.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.353
See you later, Coyote.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.314
See you, Mal.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.532
-Oh!

15:50.616 --> 15:51.784
Oh, shit!

15:53.285 --> 15:54.787
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.917
Shit. You got egg on your car.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.377
Yep, thank you.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.982
-Oh, I love it.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.776
And it's like a real backseat, too.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.320
Frankie! Come check out my new baby.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.155
You got a Muppet car.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.908
What will Fozzie Bear drive now?
Wocka-wocka.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.451
Oh, no, it's not pre-owned.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.414
Huh. A brand new car's in your budget.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.624
Well, Grace co-hosted the loan for me.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.044
Oh, really

16:44.128 --> 16:46.839
She just needed my signature.
It didn't cost me anything.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.132
Unless she defaults.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.676
Oh, no, don't blame Grace.
Default's all mine.
-Oh, God help us.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.931
Would you step out of the way
so Sheree can go to work?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.892
Right, so she can pay
for this car you co-hosted.

16:58.976 --> 16:59.810
Frankie...

16:59.893 --> 17:02.563
I'm just saying,
what do you really know about her?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.441
What does anybody really know about you?

17:05.566 --> 17:08.902
Well, I'm two Cinnabons away
from getting a free Cinnabon.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.905
You're good at getting things for free,
aren't you?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.700
Frankie, you're crossing the line.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.910
I know it's a little weird having me here,

17:17.036 --> 17:20.831
and I don't think you like me very much,
but I'm gonna change your mind.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.627
Bye!

17:29.923 --> 17:32.843
Change my mind or change my will?

17:33.385 --> 17:35.471
How about you change your whole thing?

17:49.526 --> 17:53.363
-Not until all these bottles are empty.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.865
You know what I'm talking about.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.951
The way you spoke to Sheree out there
was terrible.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.954
You've been going after her
from the moment you arrived here. I've been going after her
since there's a reason to be after her!

18:04.124 --> 18:07.294
She lied about her stepkids,
she got you to co-sign a loan...

18:07.419 --> 18:08.504
Oh, stop it.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.174
You should be thanking her for taking
such good care of your best friend.

18:12.257 --> 18:16.345
She cooks you cheddar biscuits
and keeps your cuticles back!

18:16.428 --> 18:18.347
How is that taking care of you?

18:18.430 --> 18:19.848
Well, I'll tell you how.

18:19.932 --> 18:24.353
When you went off to Santa Fe,
I was miserable.

18:24.978 --> 18:28.482
I have never been so lonely,
and it sucked.

18:28.565 --> 18:32.277
And then Sheree came here
and brought life to this house.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.531
Why didn't you tell me it was so bad?

18:35.614 --> 18:38.826
Well, because you were going off
with Jacob to be happy in your life.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.786
And I accepted that.

18:40.869 --> 18:45.082
But you can't now turn around
and be mad at me for being happy in mine.

18:45.165 --> 18:49.461
I'm not mad about you being happy
in La Jolla. I want you to be happy.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.838
Well, then, what's going on?

18:50.921 --> 18:53.090
I'm not happy in Santa Fe!

18:54.007 --> 18:54.925
What?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.428
I'd hoped
I'd said that silently in my mouth.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.348
But now that it's out in the world...

19:03.183 --> 19:05.144
shit's about to get real.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.688
I fucking hate Santa Fe!

19:08.355 --> 19:12.734
I hate the snakes, the heat, the snakes!

19:13.694 --> 19:17.948
Everybody's an artist
with long, gray hair and balloon pants

19:18.031 --> 19:21.201
and has an adopted black son.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.996
I blend right in!

19:26.582 --> 19:28.375
I've been lonely.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.794
But... you have Jacob.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.504
And I love Jacob.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.382
And I'm not lonely
when it's just the two of us.

19:35.883 --> 19:40.179
But he has his family there,
and they're like so connected.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.264
It makes me miss my family.

19:42.931 --> 19:48.187
And I miss being able to witness
that miracle of life growing in Allison...

19:49.188 --> 19:51.648
even though it has no legal rights yet.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.028
And I miss you.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.073
I miss you, too.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.202
I want to come back.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.539
Whoa, that's big.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.834
I know.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.132
Don't you think you need to talk to Jacob?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.843
Don't you think you it would be nice
if you did it for me?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.013
I'll do it.

20:24.431 --> 20:27.351
But first,
you need to do something for me.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.108
We need to talk.

20:36.693 --> 20:40.447
-We're asking the questions here, lady.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.115
Grace, ask her some questions.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.160
No. I'm the one asking questions.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.204
How could you have taken those?

20:47.287 --> 20:50.999
Did you invade my privacy?
Did you steal them?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.043
You lied to me.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.921
Because it's none of your business.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.632
Well, now that she's co-signed your loan,

20:58.715 --> 21:02.135
I think the fact that you're trying
to steal your stepchildren's house

21:02.261 --> 21:03.971
is her business!

21:04.054 --> 21:08.392
Is that what you think is going on?
Because I'm not trying to steal anything.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.686
-We read the depositions.
-Yeah.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.481
Okay, so then did you read
about how those kids didn't show up

21:14.606 --> 21:16.984
for the four years their father was sick?

21:17.567 --> 21:18.902
Or did you miss that?

21:18.986 --> 21:22.614
Or how they couldn't line up fast enough
for the reading of his will?

21:22.698 --> 21:24.700
And how I came home one day

21:24.783 --> 21:27.577
and they'd locked me out
of my own house?

21:29.496 --> 21:32.499
-We...
-...did not get that far.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.335
If you're gonna snoop, girls,
do it thoroughly.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.756
He bought that house for us.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.551
I cannot believe his kids did that to you.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.012
Oh, I stood on the lawn that day,

21:45.095 --> 21:49.766
surrounded by my clothes
and nail polish and old dog bowls,

21:49.850 --> 21:53.145
and all I could think was, "I'm homeless."

21:53.729 --> 21:55.647
How could I end up homeless?

21:56.189 --> 22:01.403
I've worked my whole life, I fell in love,
I took care of my husband,

22:01.486 --> 22:04.364
and yet, there I was
with no place to go...

22:04.448 --> 22:06.283
until Grace invited me here.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.285
Frankie?

22:08.952 --> 22:11.204
You said you wanted to talk?
It was, like, 45 minutes ago.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.789
I'm guessing it's not urgent.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.543
Uh...

22:21.548 --> 22:25.969
You know I love you, right?
I mean, I say it, you know, a lot.

22:26.053 --> 22:31.058
So, you could argue it loses its meaning.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.225
But it doesn't.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.561
I love you.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.772
Are you breaking up with me?

22:36.897 --> 22:39.232
No. No. God, no, no, no.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.443
Uh...

22:41.526 --> 22:43.528
I'm breaking up with Santa Fe.

22:45.781 --> 22:46.990
I hate it there.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.826
I shouldn't have hidden that from you.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.120
You didn't hide it that well.

22:52.579 --> 22:57.918
Like the time I asked you what you wanted
for dinner and you said, "Not Santa Fe."

22:58.001 --> 22:59.753
I thought you missed that.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.463
Why weren't you straight with me?

23:01.546 --> 23:04.841
Because I knew it would lead
to this conversation.

23:05.592 --> 23:08.595
And I just kept hoping
that I would get used to it.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.514
But you didn't.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.140
No.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.938
And somehow attending the third-worst
gender reveal party ever...

23:20.190 --> 23:25.153
only revealed how much I miss home.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.033
So now what?

23:30.617 --> 23:33.036
I don't know. I think it's your call.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.790
Long distance is brutal.

23:36.873 --> 23:40.502
But if we don't even try, I don't want
to think about what that means.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.713
How can we do this?

23:43.797 --> 23:46.842
We could Skype-Face once I learn how.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.887
I could come down
every three-day weekend,

23:51.012 --> 23:53.765
which, as far as I'm concerned,
is every weekend.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.894
We don't have to live together
to love each other.

23:59.062 --> 24:00.939
That's... true.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.153
I'm scared.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.655
It's scary.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.117
I do love you.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.872
I love you, too.

24:25.172 --> 24:29.217
As Captain and Tennille said,
"Love will keep us together."

24:29.301 --> 24:30.927
Until they got divorced.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.345
They did?

24:34.472 --> 24:38.185
Oh, my God. I should call her.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.290
You okay?

25:00.373 --> 25:03.126
Yep. You missed a good one!

25:08.590 --> 25:10.383
You hungry? I made you a plate.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.385
I'm famished, thank you.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.179
You want something to drink?

25:14.262 --> 25:15.639
I can get it.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.479
-Help me!

25:23.688 --> 25:26.274
Oh, my God. Honey, what happened?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.401
-I don't know!
-Here, I got you.

25:28.568 --> 25:32.239
I was doing my trademark
double-fisted sign twirl

25:32.322 --> 25:35.325
when something went very, very awry.

25:35.992 --> 25:38.745
Well, thank God you didn't get arrested.

25:38.828 --> 25:44.709
I almost did, but the cop felt bad for me
when I couldn't stop crying.

25:47.128 --> 25:52.217
I am so in awe of your commitment
to doing something good every single day.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.344
Every single day.

25:54.427 --> 26:00.475
But... maybe this is just too much
for your body, too.

26:00.558 --> 26:04.646
Our bodies may not be at their best,
but our minds, Robert...

26:04.771 --> 26:08.358
our minds... are not that great either.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.569
You're only bolstering my argument.

26:12.153 --> 26:15.323
But we must resist... now more than ever.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.158
Sol, let me ask you a question.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.161
If you were a surgeon
and your hands started to shake,

26:20.245 --> 26:21.371
would you give up surgery?

26:21.454 --> 26:22.289
Of course, but--

26:22.372 --> 26:25.208
And if you were a taxi driver
and you started to go blind,

26:25.292 --> 26:26.376
would you stop driving?

26:26.459 --> 26:29.087
-Not if I drove in New York.
-Sol.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.299
Robert, it's all I've got to do.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.801
You feel it's killing you to do this?

26:35.385 --> 26:37.679
I think it would kill me if I stop.

26:37.762 --> 26:38.930
Then don't stop.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.100
Just find
a less back-destroying way to protest.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.685
Or better yet, take a break.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.395
And do what?

26:45.478 --> 26:47.689
Well, we've been doing your thing
for six months,

26:47.772 --> 26:49.566
why don't you try doing mine?

26:49.649 --> 26:52.402
You know, I'm assistant directing
<i>The Music Man.</i>

26:52.485 --> 26:55.030
You could be the assistant
to the assistant director.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.781
I don't know.

26:57.657 --> 26:58.783
Maybe.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.369
Although it does sound prestigious.

27:01.453 --> 27:05.582
Just to be clear, I cannot officially
offer you that position.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.250
-Oh.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.335
Excuse me.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.799
I'm sorry for Santa Fe
and for Jacob, but...

27:14.883 --> 27:15.884
Ah.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.637
...I'm happy you're coming home to me.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.515
Me, too.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.102
Was Santa Fe really that bad?

27:26.186 --> 27:29.981
You ever reach into one of your pockets
and think, "Oh, boy, licorice!"

27:30.482 --> 27:32.817
But then it's a snake? Because I have.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.821
Well, that's why I don't buy things
with voluminous pockets.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.657
-No.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.453
May I join you?

27:43.536 --> 27:45.246
Of course. Hi.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.462
Oh, that's nice.

27:53.254 --> 27:56.257
Oh, nothing like dipping
your feet in some good CO2.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.342
Yeah.

27:58.718 --> 28:00.387
So, since you're moving back,

28:00.470 --> 28:04.265
if you just give me a little time
to find a place, I'll be out of your hair.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.309
-Oh--

28:06.685 --> 28:07.977
This is your home.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.146
Just because I don't have mine
doesn't mean--

28:10.230 --> 28:11.689
But where would you go?

28:11.773 --> 28:16.236
It's not like you can shrink yourself
and live in your tiny village.

28:16.319 --> 28:20.990
Yet. That technology is on the horizon.
We just have to wait it out.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.784
But in the meantime...

28:22.867 --> 28:24.160
Stay with us.

28:26.496 --> 28:29.457
Do you two know how lucky you are
to have each other?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.543
Yeah, I think we do.

28:31.626 --> 28:35.422
-I'm lucky. I'm really lucky.

28:35.505 --> 28:38.007
I had a lot of girlfriends in my life,

28:38.091 --> 28:40.135
but I've never had a Grace or a Frankie. Well, now you have both.

28:43.888 --> 28:47.058
And we're going to get your house back
from those rotten kids.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.351
-Yes, we are.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.394
-Right.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.813
Wait, how big are they?
