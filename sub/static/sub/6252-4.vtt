22:12.540 --> 22:13.655
- Whoa, ho-oh!
- [ Gunshots ]

22:13.750 --> 22:16.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stay down, Bones.
Stay down.

[ Gun Clatters]

22:28.056 --> 22:30.297
Booth, she’s got a shotgun.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.801
[ Groaning ]
Bones!

22:31.893 --> 22:33.099
Hey!

22:34.395 --> 22:36.477
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy,easy.

[ Groans ]

22:47.659 --> 22:49.650
[ Horn Honks]

22:52.914 --> 22:55.621
Thanks a lot, idiot!
You just cost me 200 grand.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.292
200 gra— Oh, great, just what I need—
another damn bounty hunter.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.511
Come on, we’re in your castle.
We’re all on the same side.

23:07.637 --> 23:10.094
How about losing
these stupid bracelets?
On the same side?

23:10.181 --> 23:12.046
You assaulted
a federal agent.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.974
He didn’t identify himself as such.
Besides, he’s a big boy.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.268
It’s not like he can’t
handle a love tap or two.

23:17.355 --> 23:20.438
A wanted fugitive escaped
because of your interference,
so have a seat.

23:20.525 --> 23:23.187
Look, let me go,
and I’ll get Braverman
back for you.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.902
If Braverman hurts
or kills anyone else...

23:26.990 --> 23:30.278
because you prevented his arrest,
I’ll charge you as an accessory.

23:30.368 --> 23:33.405
I’m sorry, but I’ve been chasing
this guy for 17 days now.

23:33.496 --> 23:37.330
It’s the thrill of the chase, right?
You know what I mean.

23:40.295 --> 23:42.456
Come on.

23:42.547 --> 23:44.663
Wow, you’re actually
letting me go.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.043
Well, thrill of the chase.
You get it, right?

23:47.135 --> 23:49.467
Get out of here
before I change my mind.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.015
What’d you do that for?

23:53.099 --> 23:56.011
Double the pressure on Braverman.
I don’t care who gets him first.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.593
I hate it when you’re
all adult and sensible.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.224
Give me a little bile and revenge.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.101
That’s what I appreciate
in a man.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.022
What?

24:08.156 --> 24:12.741
Human ribs can withstand
approximately 400 pounds
of force...

24:12.827 --> 24:13.987
before breaking.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.410
Now, ribs 1 through 3
are the hardest,

24:16.497 --> 24:19.580
with 4 through 9
getting progressively weaker.

24:19.667 --> 24:24.081
Our victim was a large man
with big muscles
and dense bones.

24:24.172 --> 24:27.835
I never thought of using
paint stir sticks in place of ribs.

24:27.925 --> 24:32.134
Many common household items
mimic the properties
of human body parts,

24:32.221 --> 24:34.928
like cantaloupe melons
or pudding.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.756
I’m not gonna ask
about the pudding.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.344
Start slowly
and work our way up?

24:44.942 --> 24:46.603
Professor.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.356
Thank you.

24:52.450 --> 24:53.906
Ready?

24:54.035 --> 24:58.278
[ Hodgins ]
Captain Speedy would say the speed
would give us velocity and force.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.041
Wow.
[Beeps]

25:08.132 --> 25:13.001
It’s 56 miles per hour,
which is 25.3
meters per second.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.879
That’s not enough.
All right.

25:15.973 --> 25:19.557
Ooh. How about a slingshot
with a golf ball?

25:24.816 --> 25:25.805
Ready?

25:29.487 --> 25:30.602
[ Hodgin
Wow! S]

25:30.697 --> 25:32.437
Ribs are really tough.

25:32.532 --> 25:35.148
101 miles per hour, or—

25:35.243 --> 25:37.325
45.15 meters per second.

25:38.329 --> 25:41.412
- Give or take.
- Science is fun.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.579
Yeah!

25:42.667 --> 25:45.079
But we do have
a responsibility to the truth.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.545
Yeah.
And the truth is,

25:46.629 --> 25:50.588
whatever hit this
big, tough man’s ribs
made a piece fly off.

25:50.675 --> 25:53.792
Should we step this thing up
a magnitude or two?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.428
Amazing!

26:00.059 --> 26:03.222
Sweets— Oh. Hey, how are you?
Listen, I need your help.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.268
- I’m in a session.
- No, no, no, no.

26:05.356 --> 26:08.223
Listen, I’m dealing with
a dangerous fugitive here.
You understand, don’t you?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.694
I need your brain to help me
figure out what his
next move’s gonna be.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.440
No,no,no,no.
I still got 20 minutes left
here, then I’m all yours.

26:13.531 --> 26:16.238
Oh, ho! No, no, no!
Twenty minutes is not
gonna work, all right?

26:16.325 --> 26:18.577
Two minutes.
Not a second more.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.197
Listen, whatever your
problem is, trust me,

26:20.288 --> 26:22.244
Sweets here can fix it
in two minutes.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.822
Two minutes.
Let’s go. Let’s go.
Come on.

26:26.878 --> 26:28.493
Okay.

26:28.588 --> 26:33.582
Well, deciding to change genders
is a monumental decision
in and of itself.

26:33.676 --> 26:36.088
So why don’t we take
the weekend to reflect on that,

26:36.179 --> 26:39.091
and then we’ll f—figure out
what the next steps will be.

26:39.182 --> 26:40.843

Hey.

26:47.857 --> 26:50.564
You have to go
on the Dude’s kiddie show.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.357
No, I don’t.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.607
Why?

26:55.698 --> 26:58.940
Because it’s the dream
of every kid in this country...

26:59.035 --> 27:01.321
who likes science
even a little bit.

27:01.412 --> 27:04.370
Well, I’m not a kid.
I’m a fully grown adult.

27:04.457 --> 27:06.869
Okay. Then do it
for your inner child.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.120
If you’re referring to a fetus,

27:09.212 --> 27:11.544
I, unlike you, am not
currently pregnant.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.040
Sweetie, you go on this show,

27:15.134 --> 27:18.297
and millions of little girls
are going to look at you...

27:18.387 --> 27:22.221
and say to themselves,
“I can be like her.”

27:22.308 --> 27:27.723
A scientist or an astronaut
or a brain surgeon—
blah-de-blah.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.850
You know,
shoot for the stars—
all that.

27:29.941 --> 27:34.355
Even with the “blah-de-blah,”
it seems very important to you.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.276
Yeah.

27:36.364 --> 27:39.948
If I have a daughter,
I’m going to name her
Temperance.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.033
You are?

27:44.121 --> 27:45.986
I mean, we won’t call her that.
It’s awful.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.743
Maybe it’ll be
her middle name.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.496
But... I want her to love you.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.497
You love me.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.169
Yes.

27:54.257 --> 27:58.421
But not everyone is as willing
to look as hard for your
inner child as I am.

27:58.511 --> 28:01.093

half Hodgins, remember?

28:02.807 --> 28:07.050

makes it all the way
through this case,

you should cut him a break
and go on his show.

see here?

28:35.882 --> 28:38.464
Ribs. Broken ribs.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.004
Could you be
more specific?

28:41.095 --> 28:44.053
Okay.

28:44.140 --> 28:48.224
This is a magnification
of the fourth left rib—
so it’s big—

28:48.311 --> 28:52.805
and our eyes can see things
that are usually too tiny
for the human eye.

28:52.899 --> 28:56.733
And right... here,

28:56.819 --> 28:59.026
where it’s a little
bumpy and weird,

28:59.113 --> 29:00.819
that’s where the bone
started to heal.

29:00.948 --> 29:03.280
Remodeling?
Yes, which means...

29:03.367 --> 29:06.234
this rib was broken
before this man was killed.

29:06.329 --> 29:07.819
Amazing!

29:07.914 --> 29:11.532
This injury occurred
perhaps a week before
the victim was killed.

29:11.626 --> 29:15.369
Whatever made him die
was not the same thing
that broke his rib.

29:15.463 --> 29:18.546
There were two injuries:
one that broke off
a piece of the rib—

29:18.633 --> 29:20.624
And another approximately
a week later...

29:20.718 --> 29:23.630
which propelled the bone
into his heart and killed him dead.

29:23.721 --> 29:26.178
Well, “killed him dead”
is redundant.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.098
But it’s clear.
And what do we say
about clarity?

29:29.185 --> 29:33.474
“It’s a barbarity
that clarity is a rarity.”

29:34.190 --> 29:35.680
That’s very true.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.358
[ Booth ]
Okay, what am I
looking at here?

29:43.449 --> 29:45.735
You know that myth where
some Good Samaritan...

that cracks the case?

- That’s the victim, isn’t it?
- [ Booth ] Yeah.

29:51.999 --> 29:55.332
He’s playing pool with his boss,
the bail bondsman.
So what?

29:55.419 --> 29:56.534
Here we go.

29:58.923 --> 30:00.959
Slight disagreement
between gentlemen.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.211

that wig is fooling anyone?

- He’s terminal.
- What?

30:10.810 --> 30:11.970
[ Booth ]
Oh, wow!

30:12.061 --> 30:14.643
Okay, at least we know
how he cracked his rib.

30:16.691 --> 30:19.774
- Gotta give the little guy credit for guts.
- Someone thinks he’s gonna die,

30:19.860 --> 30:22.272
he takes risks
he might otherwise avoid.

30:22.363 --> 30:25.901
Yeah.
Or he just goes crazy.

30:32.289 --> 30:34.871
The Wolf cheated.
He called the wrong shot.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.621
There was money at stake.
I did what I had to do.

30:37.712 --> 30:39.748
Yeah, so you cracked him
in the ribs?

30:39.880 --> 30:43.293
I protested
in a vigorous fashion.
[ Scoffs ]

30:43.384 --> 30:45.124
We put it behind us.

30:45.219 --> 30:47.505
I didn’t track him down
and kill him later.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.382
Maybe he wasn’t so forgiving.

30:49.473 --> 30:54.137
Maybe he felt embarrassed
that an old man in a bad wig
made him look like a fool.

30:54.228 --> 30:58.346
- Right. So he comes after you.
- You protest again,
even more vigorously—

30:58.441 --> 31:00.602
by which I mean
you chop off his head.

Look! You people—

31:03.612 --> 31:06.740
Guys like me and the Wolf,
we’re not lawyers.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.689
We don’t talk things through.

31:08.784 --> 31:12.026
The Wolf once took a shot at me
because I complimented
his mother...

31:12.121 --> 31:13.952
in a way he didn’t appreciate.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.747
Guys like you,
you get older, you get weak,
maybe you overcompensate?

31:16.834 --> 31:19.166
I’m still kickin’.
Thanks, sonny.

31:19.253 --> 31:21.915
You’re wearing that wig
because of chemotherapy.

31:22.006 --> 31:24.463
You are going to die, sir,
within the next year.

31:31.974 --> 31:34.932

more like six months.

31:35.019 --> 31:38.682
And it’s none of your business,
but I believe in God,

31:38.773 --> 31:42.015
and I would like
to make a good impression
when I stand before him.

Make up for what,
about a hundred
assault convictions?

31:44.695 --> 31:47.607
Assault in the course
of my chosen profession.

31:47.698 --> 31:50.940
No aggravated assault,
no killing anybody.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.364
If I were you, I’d be asking...

31:54.455 --> 31:58.164
why Janet LeBlanc sent you
that security tape.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.865
Oh, what?
The other bounty hunter?

31:59.960 --> 32:01.666
She’s the only one
who would benefit.

32:01.754 --> 32:05.042
Why would one of
your own bounty hunters
want to incriminate you?

32:05.132 --> 32:10.047
Because she wants you
wasting your time on me
while she finds Braverman.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.593
Mission accomplished.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.966
- You’re being pretty damn helpful.
Isn’t he?
- Mm-hmm.

32:14.058 --> 32:16.094
If you get to Braverman first,

32:16.185 --> 32:19.177
I don’t have to pay out 200 large.

32:21.190 --> 32:24.432

of 2 7 st and Scott in 30 minutes.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.840
Okay, that recording was made
an hour and a half ago.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.178
I contacted the officers who were
assigned to protect Molly,
and she’s already gone.

32:54.265 --> 32:57.678
What kind of woman runs away
with a man whom she knows
to be a murderer?

32:57.768 --> 32:59.633
I should have known.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.105
She’s so used to being controlled,
she can’t live without it.

33:02.189 --> 33:05.431
I don’t care about why.
The question is where.
Where are they?

33:05.526 --> 33:09.360
Right here. Okay,
the intersection where they
planned to meet is right here.

33:09.446 --> 33:10.982
Now, if Molly was driving—

33:11.073 --> 33:13.314
No,no,no.
He would have taken over
once they got together.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.821
- How could you possibly know that?
- Well, since she’s willing...

33:15.911 --> 33:18.243
to accept the fact that
her husband killed a man,

33:18.330 --> 33:21.322
it suggests that
she’s a submissive
and compliant woman.

33:21.417 --> 33:22.782
So, where do you think
they’ll go?

33:22.877 --> 33:25.414
Okay, this is ludicrous.
Sweets can’t possibly know that.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.415
Actually, I can.

33:27.506 --> 33:31.090
What I’m doing here,
it’s no less precise
than profiling a suspect.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.213

is not random.

It’s right off the 66 interstate.

From here,
Braverman will head west.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.682
[ Scoffs ]
Now you’re psychic?

33:40.769 --> 33:43.556
Eighty-seven percent
of all people escaping
head west.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.764
I know.
It’s one of those bizarre
psychological truths.

33:46.859 --> 33:50.067
It’s like, uh, circling
clockwise when you’re
staking out a house.

33:50.154 --> 33:52.315
Even the Dude would
call that pseudoscience.

33:52.406 --> 33:55.113
Credit card records show past
reservations at campgrounds...

33:55.201 --> 33:57.442
at Walker State Park
and Fremont State Park.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.073
Yeah. They would want
a familiar place
where they feel secure.

34:00.164 --> 34:02.780
Both west of here,
by the way.
Just—

34:02.875 --> 34:06.868
Okay, well, then the fastest
route here is between
the 66 and 81.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.669
I’ll buy it,
especially since we don’t
have anything else.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.339
- He won’t make it to the 81.
- Now who’s psychic?

34:12.426 --> 34:15.384
When Braverman rolled off
the car, he landed flat-footed.

34:15.471 --> 34:17.883
From that height,
and the speed he was going,

34:17.973 --> 34:21.215
he must have dislocated
his femoral head
from his acetabular.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.221
No, it couldn’t be that bad.
He’s been running ever since.

34:23.312 --> 34:25.803
Once he’s in the car
and immobile,

34:25.898 --> 34:28.890
his adrenaline will wear off,
and the pain
will become unbearable.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.940
He’ll need drugs
and medical care.

34:31.028 --> 34:34.361
- You don’t think he’d be stupid
enough to go to a hospital?
- He won’t have a choice.

34:34.448 --> 34:37.611
I’ll contact all the hospitals
and the urgent care facilities
along the route.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.405
Nothing?
You’ve found nothing?

34:40.496 --> 34:42.202
We have tried everything
we could think of.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.575
The problem is, projectiles
either bounce off the rib,

34:44.667 --> 34:46.783
crack it or fragment it
into several pieces.

34:46.877 --> 34:49.038
But nothing knocked out
one small fragment?

34:49.129 --> 34:51.381
It’s like I told the Science Dude,
we need something...

34:51.465 --> 34:53.751
that strikes at more
than 40 meters per second...

34:53.842 --> 34:55.753
but less than 70 meters
persecond.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.755
Which translates to?

34:57.846 --> 35:02.215
Faster than a golf ball
hit with a 3-iron,
but slower than a rubber bullet.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.995

congruent with what happened,

from the Dude?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.143
That would be correct.

36:34.234 --> 36:37.442
- Okay, murder by vegetable?
- Well, not literally.

approximates the speed,

36:40.282 --> 36:42.398

that a potato gun...

generate the same Fig Newtons
