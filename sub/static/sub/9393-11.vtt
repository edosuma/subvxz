Well, to be honest,

08:43.270 --> 08:44.438
if you divorce her,

08:44.472 --> 08:46.606
she'll probably get
everything you have.

08:46.641 --> 08:48.208
What? No,
that's impossible!

08:48.242 --> 08:49.910
I can't lose all

08:49.944 --> 08:51.378

guy apartment!

for your plate.

08:56.184 --> 08:57.985
The oven, of course,
is just decorative.

08:58.019 --> 08:59.319
Seems okay.

08:59.354 --> 09:00.834

units available?

09:06.461 --> 09:07.561
Sorry, Quagmire,

09:07.595 --> 09:08.895
but the only way
around the law

09:08.930 --> 09:10.530
is if the woman
consents to a divorce.

09:10.565 --> 09:11.832
Consent?

09:11.866 --> 09:13.300
But Charmese will
never agree to that.

09:13.334 --> 09:15.635
You heard her, the crazy skank
wants to be a wife.

09:15.670 --> 09:16.803

herself a husband

09:16.838 --> 09:17.804

letting go.

09:17.839 --> 09:19.239
I bet she's what happens

09:19.273 --> 09:21.375
if you put a Hooters girl
in the microwave on "high."

09:21.409 --> 09:22.509
Well, the only
other choice

09:22.543 --> 09:24.111
is to let her take
all your money.

09:24.145 --> 09:25.779
(sighs) Well, I
obviously can't do that.

09:25.813 --> 09:27.533
I guess I'm just gonna
have to suck it up...

09:27.548 --> 09:29.566
Let her suck it up-- she's
the expert. Sorry, keep going.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.535
...and at least try to make
things work with Charmese.

09:31.569 --> 09:32.869
And who knows?

09:32.904 --> 09:34.538
Maybe it... maybe it
won't be that bad.

09:34.572 --> 09:36.807
After all, I liked her enough
to marry her last night.

09:36.841 --> 09:38.081
I must've seen
something in her.

09:38.109 --> 09:39.743
There you go, that's
the spirit, buddy.

09:39.777 --> 09:41.378
There's a little bit
of good in everyone.

09:41.379 --> 09:43.380
Except that president guy
from <i>The Hunger Games.</i>

09:43.414 --> 09:44.464
He was pretty bad.

09:44.532 --> 09:46.666
This year, in addition
to the Hunger Games,

09:46.701 --> 09:49.186
we're going to do
the Special Hunger Games.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.370
I'm Andy!

09:50.405 --> 09:51.855
I love
you, Andy!

09:51.889 --> 09:53.223
Come on,
guys, fight.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.627
So, Doc, I figured
if Charmese and I

09:57.662 --> 09:58.962
are gonna live
as man and wife,

09:58.996 --> 10:00.297
I ought to get
her checked out.

10:00.331 --> 10:02.499
Of course. Charmese,
when's the last time

10:02.533 --> 10:03.700
you had a pelvic exam?

10:03.735 --> 10:05.502
When was
the Missouri Compromise?

10:05.536 --> 10:07.370
Uh, I think 1821.

10:07.405 --> 10:09.372
Then I've never
had a pelvic exam.

10:09.407 --> 10:10.557
All right,
I'm going in.

10:10.591 --> 10:12.743
If I tug on the rope twice,
that means pull me out.

10:14.145 --> 10:16.713
(squishy footsteps)

10:16.748 --> 10:18.248
HARTMAN:
God, who are the pigs

10:18.282 --> 10:20.751
who just throw their
empty beer cans down here?

10:24.655 --> 10:25.622
Hey, Charmese.

10:25.656 --> 10:27.457
You know, I really
love your clothes...

10:27.491 --> 10:28.708
I found a lot of them

10:28.743 --> 10:30.610
on strung-out
teenage corpses.

10:30.645 --> 10:31.611
That's so lovely.

10:31.646 --> 10:33.207
But I was thinking,
maybe this afternoon

10:33.214 --> 10:34.714
you'd like to borrow
my credit card

10:34.749 --> 10:36.183
and buy yourself
a new wardrobe.

10:36.217 --> 10:37.984
You know, something
a little more conservative.

10:38.019 --> 10:38.985
Really?

10:39.020 --> 10:40.520
That's so
sweet, Glenn.

10:40.555 --> 10:42.823
No one's ever cared
about me like that before.

10:42.857 --> 10:44.424
Thank you.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.500
I would like to pawn
all these clothes

11:10.535 --> 11:11.735
for crack money.

11:15.039 --> 11:17.174
Gosh, thanks so much
for having us over, you guys.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.775
Of course, Glenn.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.544
Welcome to our
home, Charmese.

11:20.578 --> 11:21.945
Sit anywhere you like.

11:21.979 --> 11:24.981
That chair with the garbage bag
taped over it looks pretty good.

11:26.434 --> 11:28.301
Meg, you look
pretty next to her.

11:28.336 --> 11:30.237
So, Charmese,

11:30.271 --> 11:32.005
I was thinking
of writing an article

11:32.039 --> 11:33.406
about you
for my school paper.

11:33.441 --> 11:35.976
Do you charge black guys
more or less?

11:36.010 --> 11:37.644
Hmm, that's a hard question
to answer.

11:37.678 --> 11:39.346
Most of them get a group rate.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.114
Come on, now,
let's not talk about work.

11:41.149 --> 11:42.249
It's a dinner party.

11:42.283 --> 11:44.467
Are you and Glenn
thinking about children?

11:44.502 --> 11:47.037
Unfortunately,
I can't have children.

11:47.071 --> 11:48.638
Oh, menopause?

11:48.673 --> 11:51.842
No, I got knifed
in the vagina one Christmas.

11:51.876 --> 11:53.877
Ah, the holidays
are always stressful.

11:53.911 --> 11:56.346
I have $3.74.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.931
Do something to me.

11:57.965 --> 11:59.332
(hawks, spits)

11:59.367 --> 12:00.700
I love you.

12:00.735 --> 12:03.253
I want to take you
away from all this.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.205
They're supposedly putting
an ice cream place

12:05.239 --> 12:06.907
where the shoe store was.

12:06.941 --> 12:09.059
Excuse me, Lois,
where's your bathroom?

12:09.093 --> 12:11.127
I got to check on
a whistling sound.

12:11.129 --> 12:14.030
Upstairs, to the left.

12:14.065 --> 12:17.434
Um, I'm obsessed
with Charmese.

12:20.905 --> 12:22.305
Hey.

12:22.340 --> 12:23.340
Let's do it.

12:23.374 --> 12:24.991
What? You mean, like sex?

12:25.026 --> 12:26.576
Yeah, and we
should go now.

12:26.611 --> 12:28.251
I just stuffed everything
back into place.

12:28.279 --> 12:29.713
Uh, you know, Charmese,

12:29.747 --> 12:31.414
I don't really think
I'm in the mood.

12:31.449 --> 12:32.983
What? You're never
in the mood.

12:33.017 --> 12:34.417
We've been married
two weeks,

12:34.452 --> 12:36.453
and we haven't done it
since that first night.

12:36.487 --> 12:38.221
I haven't gone two
weeks without sex

12:38.256 --> 12:40.690
since I was in a
coma for six weeks.

12:40.725 --> 12:43.093
Yeah, sorry, Charmese,
I'm-I'm just not feeling it.

12:43.127 --> 12:45.128
Geez, what the hell's
your problem?

12:45.162 --> 12:47.030
What are... what are you,
gay or something?

12:47.064 --> 12:48.865
Excuse me?
You heard me.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.367
Are you some kind of 'mo?

12:50.401 --> 12:53.169
Oh, God, please tell me I'm
not married to some Nancy boy.

12:53.204 --> 12:56.223
Why? Would that
be a problem?

12:56.257 --> 12:58.608
Are you kidding?
Course it would.

12:58.643 --> 13:01.044
My dream is to live the
married life and settle down.

13:01.078 --> 13:03.246
I can't be doing
that with no gay.

13:03.281 --> 13:04.781
I see.

13:04.815 --> 13:07.751
Well, Charmese,
I have something to tell you,

13:07.785 --> 13:09.786
and this isn't easy.

13:09.820 --> 13:10.987
But I'm gay.

13:11.022 --> 13:12.455
What? No.

13:12.490 --> 13:13.757
You can't be.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.825
I was gonna be your
perfect little wife.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.495
I was gonna make you
breakfast maybe once a week,

13:18.529 --> 13:19.930
and give you stuff to do

13:19.964 --> 13:21.898
right when you walk through
the door after work.

13:21.916 --> 13:23.600
And I would've
loved that, Charmese,

13:23.634 --> 13:26.469
if I just weren't
so super duper double gay.

13:26.504 --> 13:29.272
(sobbing):
Oh, this is awful.

13:29.307 --> 13:30.607
Aw, don't cry, Charmese.

13:30.641 --> 13:31.891
You'll find the right guy.

13:31.926 --> 13:33.093
There's someone
for everyone.

13:33.127 --> 13:35.312
Even if you're
a narcissistic pedophile.

13:35.346 --> 13:38.014
Hey, Ma, we got any pictures
of me when I was a kid?

13:38.049 --> 13:39.599
Maybe something in a tub?

13:41.702 --> 13:43.770
I'm really sorry it
didn't work out, Glenn.

13:43.804 --> 13:45.205
Me, too, Charmese.

13:45.239 --> 13:46.573
I'll send
the divorce papers

13:46.607 --> 13:49.609
to that Rite Aid
where you brush your teeth.

13:51.195 --> 13:52.696
Hey, buddy, what happened?
She gone?

13:52.730 --> 13:54.180
Yep, I'm off
the hook, Peter.

13:54.215 --> 13:55.582
I told Charmese
I was gay,

13:55.616 --> 13:57.717
and now she's gonna consent
to a no-fault divorce.

13:57.752 --> 13:59.552
That's brilliant,
Quagmire.

13:59.587 --> 14:01.655
It's the exact opposite
of what Hugh Jackman does.

14:01.689 --> 14:03.990
Pretend you're gay
to get out of marriage.

14:04.025 --> 14:05.158
(sighs)
Thank God.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.493
I really dodged
a bullet there.

14:06.527 --> 14:08.361
I don't know what the
hell I was thinking.

14:08.396 --> 14:09.796
Eh, everybody
makes mistakes.

14:09.830 --> 14:11.197
Even doctors.

14:11.232 --> 14:12.699
(prolonged beep)

14:12.733 --> 14:14.567
You forgot to say...

14:14.602 --> 14:16.369
I forgot to say "clear."

14:16.404 --> 14:19.539
(sighs)
Finally, back to my old life.

14:20.691 --> 14:23.009
Hello, Internet porn.

14:23.044 --> 14:24.878
Man, I haven't done this
in two weeks.

14:24.912 --> 14:26.980
I should weigh myself
before and after.

14:27.014 --> 14:29.499
Sorry, I forgot
my prescription mouthwash.

14:29.533 --> 14:31.201
Aah!
Oh, my God.

14:31.235 --> 14:32.535
What are you watching?

14:32.570 --> 14:34.104
That... that's
straight porn.

14:34.138 --> 14:36.022
Listen, Charmese, it's not
what you think, all right?

14:36.057 --> 14:37.257
I've been poisoned,

14:37.291 --> 14:38.825
and I'm trying to
make myself throw up.

14:38.859 --> 14:40.844
Gay men don't watch
straight porn.

14:40.878 --> 14:43.079
You lied to me,
you son of a bitch.

14:43.114 --> 14:44.681
No, no, I'm gay, I swear!

14:44.715 --> 14:46.416
Here, watch me,
uh, uh, go there.

14:46.450 --> 14:47.917
Jen Aniston?

14:47.952 --> 14:50.387
More like Jen
Can't-get-a-man-iston!

14:50.421 --> 14:51.855
See? I went there.

14:51.889 --> 14:53.356
Damn it, Glenn,
if you're not gay,

14:53.391 --> 14:54.891
then the divorce is off.

14:54.925 --> 14:56.826
No, no, I am.
I swear to God.

14:56.861 --> 14:58.228
All right, fine.

14:58.262 --> 15:00.230
If you're really gay
and you want that divorce,

15:00.264 --> 15:02.132
all you got to do is one thing.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.633
Anything, Charmese. Name it.

15:03.667 --> 15:04.968
Prove it.

15:05.002 --> 15:07.070
Let me watch you have sex
with a man.

15:07.104 --> 15:08.805
Wh-What?

15:08.839 --> 15:10.006
You heard me.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.242
I want to see you
get it on with a guy.

15:12.276 --> 15:14.077
(sighs)

15:14.111 --> 15:16.379
All right, Charmese,
I'll do it.

15:16.414 --> 15:21.084
If that's what it takes,
I'll have sex with another man.

15:21.118 --> 15:22.652
(bell rings)

15:22.686 --> 15:23.920
Look, Daddy.

15:23.954 --> 15:25.655
Teacher says every
time a bell rings,

15:25.689 --> 15:28.391
some gay guy's gonna have
sex with another gay guy.

15:28.426 --> 15:31.494
We're gonna pull you
out of that school.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.696
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>The Dyslexic Baseball Wrap-Up.</i>

15:39.730 --> 15:41.714
And the Yew Nork Nankees
bave heaten

15:41.749 --> 15:44.484
the Oltimore Borioles nive
to foo here at Yamden Cards.

15:44.518 --> 15:46.953
The Borioles now
lace a fong toad rip

15:46.987 --> 15:48.705
where they'll
face the Sed Rox,

15:48.739 --> 15:50.973
the Revil Days
and the Jue Blays.

15:51.008 --> 15:52.508
(knocking)

15:52.543 --> 15:54.177
Hey, Peter, you got a minute?

15:54.211 --> 15:55.778
Oh, yeah, sure.
Come on in, Quagmire.

15:55.813 --> 15:58.781
Listen, um, I need
to ask you to do something,

15:58.816 --> 16:00.783
and it's something huge.

16:00.818 --> 16:02.785
I mean, it's, like,
the biggest thing

16:02.820 --> 16:04.787
a guy could ever ask
his friend to do.

16:04.822 --> 16:06.989
Hey, we're best pals, right?
Whatever you need.

16:07.024 --> 16:08.357
All right,
and you have to understand,

16:08.392 --> 16:11.394
I would never ask you to do this
if I had any other choice

16:11.428 --> 16:12.862
and if what were at stake

16:12.896 --> 16:15.164
was anything less
than my entire way of life.

16:15.199 --> 16:16.666
Geez, Quagmire, what is it?

16:16.700 --> 16:18.267
Charmese won't
give me a divorce

16:18.302 --> 16:20.136
because she doesn't
believe I'm gay,

16:20.170 --> 16:24.140
so I need you to have sex
with me while she watches.

16:33.684 --> 16:35.351
I have some demands.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.686
Of course, of course.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.954
Nobody can ever know.

16:37.988 --> 16:39.689
Absolutely. I'm right there
with you on that one.

16:39.723 --> 16:41.257
There will be no
kissing on the mouth.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.792
Okay.
I changed my mind.

16:42.826 --> 16:44.460
There will be kissing
on the mouth.

16:44.495 --> 16:45.962
Uh, all right.

16:45.996 --> 16:47.163
Good. Now, what else?

16:47.197 --> 16:48.448
What else? Uh, yes.

16:48.482 --> 16:50.383
If, per chance,
it is beautiful,

16:50.417 --> 16:51.984
I reserve the
right to cry.

16:52.019 --> 16:53.519
Peter, I can't imagine
any scenario

16:53.554 --> 16:54.921
where this
is gonna be beautiful.

16:54.955 --> 16:56.022
Oh, I can.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.390
I'm a very
passionate man.

16:57.424 --> 16:59.542
Haven't you ever seen
my Spanish soap operas?

16:59.576 --> 17:01.327
<i>Mi amor!</i>

17:02.996 --> 17:04.313
Papa!

17:05.531 --> 17:07.066
<i>Niño!</i>

17:09.368 --> 17:11.503
<i>Bueno.</i>

17:22.132 --> 17:23.800
Peter, can we just
get out of here?

17:23.834 --> 17:25.284
I want to get
this over with.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.986
This was part
of the deal, Quagmire.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.788
I need this
to be a lovely evening.

17:28.822 --> 17:30.022
Fine.

17:30.057 --> 17:31.991
How was work today?

17:32.025 --> 17:33.426
I don't want to talk
about work.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.061
Hey, should we go
someplace else for dessert?

17:35.095 --> 17:36.429
You know, someplace fun,
downtown,

17:36.463 --> 17:37.864
where the college kids go?

17:37.898 --> 17:40.099
What? I'm not taking you to
two different restaurants.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.702
Huh. Hard to believe
your marriage isn't working out.

17:42.736 --> 17:44.654
A rose for the gentleman?

17:44.688 --> 17:46.289
What? No. Scram.

17:46.323 --> 17:48.324
Hey, I'm not just
a poorly cleaned butt.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.459
There's a whole man around it
you have to please.

17:50.494 --> 17:51.561
Fine.

17:51.595 --> 17:53.079
Here.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.031
Quagmire, what's going on
with you?

17:55.065 --> 17:56.566
You don't seem
very present tonight.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.884
Why are you so tense?

17:57.918 --> 18:00.453
I'm tense because I have
to bang you in 20 minutes!

18:00.487 --> 18:02.488
Well, if it's so much
of a chore.

18:03.774 --> 18:06.175
What the (bleep) is
going on with my life?

18:09.146 --> 18:10.713
Okay, Charmese, here we go.

18:10.747 --> 18:12.582
Are you sure you want
to watch this?

18:12.616 --> 18:14.617
I'm just warning you,
you're in the splash zone.

18:14.651 --> 18:16.752
Ugh, if I get anything
out, I'll be happy.

18:16.787 --> 18:17.820
Get on with it.

18:17.855 --> 18:19.188
Uh, okay.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.275
Here, let me
stroke your hair.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.809
Thank you.

18:23.844 --> 18:26.312
I want to do gay
things for you.

18:26.346 --> 18:29.682
I... I crave your groin.

18:29.716 --> 18:33.553
Yes, and I cannot wait
to intertwine our bodies

18:33.587 --> 18:36.372
and make each other's
fingers smell terrible.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.107
Enough! Kiss each other.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.645
(vomiting)

18:42.679 --> 18:43.946
(gulps)

18:43.981 --> 18:46.148
Oh, yeah,
that was so hot.

18:46.183 --> 18:48.050
Just like we always do.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.952
Now take off
each other's clothes.

18:49.987 --> 18:53.205
(sobbing): Oh, God, I'm so
excited for gay sex.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.607
(crying):
Me, too.

18:54.641 --> 18:57.293
Your body makes me
so horny.

18:57.327 --> 18:59.228
Shut up and do it.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.964
(whimpering)

19:06.203 --> 19:08.404
It's very close, Peter.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.274
The paintbrush
is about to touch the canvas.

19:11.325 --> 19:12.625
Come on, Peter.

19:12.643 --> 19:14.093
Sir Ian McKellen does this.

19:14.127 --> 19:15.311
You can do this.

19:15.345 --> 19:16.596
Here we go.
Here we go.

19:16.630 --> 19:17.980
Here we go!
Just do it!

19:18.015 --> 19:19.215
Wait.

19:19.249 --> 19:20.566
(sighs)
Stop.

19:20.601 --> 19:23.903
Look, Glenn,
you're obviously not gay.

19:23.937 --> 19:25.621
Ye I am.
Well, I'm something

19:25.656 --> 19:27.924
'cause I've been at full-sail
for the last half hour.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.592
No, Glenn, you're not.

19:29.626 --> 19:31.928
I see that now,
and the truth is,

19:31.962 --> 19:34.463
if you're willing to go
this far to get a divorce,

19:34.498 --> 19:37.667
then maybe we shouldn't
be married after all.

19:37.701 --> 19:39.802
What... what are you saying?

19:39.836 --> 19:42.371
I'm saying,
I'll give you your divorce.

19:42.406 --> 19:44.006
You're off the hook.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.241
Oh.

19:45.275 --> 19:46.409
Oh, thank you, Charmese.

19:46.443 --> 19:47.710
Thank you so much.

19:47.744 --> 19:50.413
I-I can't believe
you'd do that for me.

19:50.447 --> 19:51.847
Well, it's for me, too.

19:51.882 --> 19:53.649
You were real nice
to me, Glenn,

19:53.684 --> 19:55.351
nicer than
any other guy's been,

19:55.385 --> 19:57.320
but I wanted
to be somebody's wife,

19:57.354 --> 19:59.655
not somebody's burden.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.173
Good luck to you, sweetie.

20:01.208 --> 20:03.275
And good luck to
you, Charmese.

20:03.310 --> 20:04.510
Thanks.

20:04.544 --> 20:06.278
You're very special to me.

20:06.313 --> 20:09.548
I'm sorry my urine melted a hole
through your toilet.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.783
Aw.

20:13.303 --> 20:15.287
(sighs)
Thank God that's over.

20:15.322 --> 20:16.656
Yeah, no kidding.

20:16.690 --> 20:18.924
Hey, you know, there's not
too many guys in the world

20:18.959 --> 20:20.793
who would be willing to do
something like that

20:20.827 --> 20:21.827
for their pal.

20:21.862 --> 20:23.029
Ah, don't mention it.

20:23.063 --> 20:24.363
No, no,
you're an amazing friend,

20:24.398 --> 20:25.831
and I really owe you.

20:25.866 --> 20:27.266
Thanks, Peter.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.301
Ah, you're welcome, buddy.

20:31.204 --> 20:33.883
Hey, Quagmire, why is the red
light blinking on your computer?

20:36.516 --> 20:38.467
STEWIE: What are
we watching? <i>Glee?</i>
