Would you mind runninga background check for me?

09:11.333 --> 09:13.596
Well, if that's for the repo
case, I-I can handle it.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.858
It's not.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.689
Wait, you want me to run
a background check on Dr. Shah?

09:19.733 --> 09:20.864
After one date?

09:20.908 --> 09:22.474
Yeah, I know, I shouldhave done it before

09:30.134 --> 09:32.136
Okay, I mean,Ethan seems great.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.964
He's fantastic, there's just...

09:34.008 --> 09:35.618
something I can't put
my finger on.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.577
He's too perfect or something.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.796
Okay. Now I'm curious.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.972
Give me a couple hours
to do a deep dive.

09:42.016 --> 09:43.713
If there's anything shady
about the good doctor,

09:43.757 --> 09:46.063

You got it.

on that date?

What are you not telling me?

09:54.855 --> 09:56.334
Can we just focus
on the job at hand?

09:56.378 --> 09:58.336
Please. Right.All right.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.948
So I've linked the Gulfstream to
a series of numbered companies

10:00.991 --> 10:03.646

based in the Caymans.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.780

Alex Dorian,

10:08.608 --> 10:11.828

between the mainland and Oahu.

And according to air traffic
control reports, it says that

10:14.657 --> 10:16.180
the plane is here
on a private airstrip.

10:16.224 --> 10:19.749
And according to a flight plan
logged with the FAA,

10:19.793 --> 10:22.143
it's due to take off at 11:45.

Jell-O wrestling.

just with the local flair.

through the books,

a few grand a month.

So we just need to ride this
thing out until it gets better.

I know a guy,

take a finder's fee.

got that covered.

Other than Dorian, only person
I told was my girlfriend.

24:28.336 --> 24:31.731
Personally, I hope it was
your girlfriend who told them,

is that Moreno's men

24:50.880 --> 24:53.143
Moreno's got a high-level
informant inside the department.

24:53.187 --> 24:56.016
We have to assume
he's on the comms.

24:56.059 --> 24:58.192
Your source on all this
is a drug runner.

Dorian would have driven
straight there.

This is Detective Palima.

household items.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.065
The acidity
in the lemons

33:44.109 --> 33:45.501

the electrical current.

33:45.545 --> 33:47.068

to the nails

You know, if the pain's
getting to be a little too much,

35:17.854 --> 35:20.640
Well, I think you're just...

to pull the rip cord

35:22.337 --> 35:24.905

to be something.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.255
And why would I do that?

You don't want to get hurt.

35:31.651 --> 35:32.782
After everything
that's happened,

35:32.826 --> 35:34.132
I can't say
I blame you.

Look, the law of averages
says it's probably

35:38.005 --> 35:40.007

with this guy anyway.

35:40.050 --> 35:43.967
But, um, I think you owe it
to yourself to at least

[man speaks indistinctly

Maybe we should circle
back to this conversation.

That's a lot of firepower.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.983
Rick and TC are still
a few minutes out.

Matter of fact, there is.
We're here for Renaldo.

at an impasse.

to pawn it to buy the new tires,
