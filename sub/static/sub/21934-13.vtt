WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.337
Previously on Scorpion...
It's Quincy Berkstead.

00:03.371 --> 00:04.572
The man who stole
your fiancÃ©e?

00:04.605 --> 00:06.274
QUINCY: You're the reason
Amy left you.

00:06.307 --> 00:09.477
The only person you blame is me.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.085
WALTER:
We're married?

00:18.452 --> 00:20.421
PAIGE: So, tell me more
about this dream.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.255
There's nothing to tell.

00:21.289 --> 00:24.292
The best part
was getting to meet you.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.200
CABE:
I got

00:32.233 --> 00:33.801
my own exercise regimen.
I'm not doing this.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.768
Like hell you're not.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.438
Homeland stated
specifically, "All agents

00:37.471 --> 00:39.373
"returning to the field
after extended medical absence,

00:39.407 --> 00:40.441
"sabbatical, or other leave

00:40.474 --> 00:43.111
must pass the federal
physical fitness standards."

00:43.144 --> 00:44.645
Director Carson is saying
your suspension falls

00:44.678 --> 00:46.814
under "other leave."
You have to take the test.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.217
Carson's just mad
'cause I beat him in court.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.385
You fail, you
get desk duty.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.186
Which means you can't
be Scorpion's liaison.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.688
Good news is,
my workout works.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.557
We do resistance
running with parachutes

00:56.590 --> 00:57.425
and sled training...

00:57.458 --> 00:59.327
There's no way
I can pass that test.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.629
It was originally designed for
recruits coming out of college.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.764
And that's who will
take your job.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.766
It's unbelievable.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.236
You dedicate your whole life
to your work--

01:08.269 --> 01:09.637
blood, sweat, and tears.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.140
And then one day,
younger people

01:12.173 --> 01:14.508
with less experience
come in and take over.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.110
Not going to let
that happen.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.112
Go grab your gym
clothes, okay?

01:18.146 --> 01:20.748
We've got work to do.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.216
WALTER: I'm sure
you'll do great, Paige.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.751
You're smart
and very organized.

01:23.784 --> 01:24.885
Thank you, sweetie.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.687
Uh, don't thank me.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.257
Thank the Walteration One.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.093
I don't even want to know.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.597
I created an artificial
intelligence device programmed

01:36.630 --> 01:38.766
with over a billion
possible stimuli responses

01:38.799 --> 01:41.635
in preparation for today's
doomsday bunker inspection.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.204
I don't like those things.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.672
Creepy. SYLVESTER:
It's progress.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.208
I mentioned that we were
almost out of Fruity Moons,

01:47.241 --> 01:48.176
and the Walteration

01:48.209 --> 01:49.443
ordered a new box online

01:49.477 --> 01:50.644
without even asking.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.180
CABE:
And that's the problem.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.282
Nobody does anything
for themselves anymore.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.784
Nobody can spell
because of spell-check,

01:56.817 --> 01:59.353
can't remember a phone number
because of the speed dial.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.788
Mark my words,

02:00.821 --> 02:04.192
someday it's gonna be
Rise of the Machines.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.859
And who's that
gonna be good for?

02:05.893 --> 02:07.895
Robots are the future.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.096
Anyway, we got to go.
Bunker's not close.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.565
Happy and Toby better be back
from their honeymoon soon.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.601
Actually, just Happy.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.936
Oh, right. How did Toby
take the news about the job?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.405
Why are you asking me?

02:17.438 --> 02:19.207
You handle our EQ issues.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.409
And it's gonna
be emotional for Toby.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.745
You know, falls within
your job description, not mine.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.913
TOBY:
What'll be emotional for Toby?

02:25.946 --> 02:27.915
Oh. Hey, guys.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.383
How was your honeymoon?

02:29.417 --> 02:30.418
That's a nice
diversion attempt.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.519
What's going on?
Nothing.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.488
Nothing major. We just have
that bunker inspection

02:34.522 --> 02:35.689
for SafeCorp Survival.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.291
Right. The doomsday guys.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.459
SafeCorp Survival.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.428
Founded in 2004.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.430
A survival preparation
company specializing

02:42.463 --> 02:45.299
in post-apocalyptic housing.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.900
I don't even want to know.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.369
Seems SafeCorp wants
their AI checked

02:48.402 --> 02:49.303
and their coding screened

02:49.337 --> 02:51.439
and their facial recognition
software tested.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.573
TOBY:
Yeah, probably want

02:52.606 --> 02:53.507
their system analyzed

02:53.541 --> 02:55.509
by the world's
most qualified behaviorist

02:55.543 --> 02:58.279
so that people don't go cuckoo
for Armageddon Puffs

02:58.312 --> 02:59.747
while spending five years
underground.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.615
Right?

03:01.649 --> 03:04.485
Well, yes and no.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.620
I'm out of here.
WALTER: It appears

03:06.654 --> 03:09.490
SafeCorp has their own
in-house behaviorist,

03:09.523 --> 03:12.493
so they asked that you...
not come along.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.627
I'm-I'm so... I'm so sorry.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.828
My-my hearing must be going,

03:14.862 --> 03:16.764
because I thought
that you just said

03:16.797 --> 03:19.633
that they don't want to hire
a Harvard-trained behaviorist

03:19.667 --> 03:21.469
'cause they got
some rink-a-dink shrink.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.636
No,

03:22.670 --> 03:23.471
your hearing's fine.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.572
Well, who is this quack?

03:24.605 --> 03:26.574
They didn't say.
It's not important.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.409
They're-they're the client.
It's their call.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.710
This is really great.
(door opens)

03:29.743 --> 03:32.513
Just when I thought
I couldn't feel any lower.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.648
Hello, everyone.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.950
Are we leaving soon
to inspect the bunker?

03:36.984 --> 03:37.818
She gets to go?

03:37.851 --> 03:40.554
They wanted a-a chemist

03:40.588 --> 03:42.556
to inspect
their water filtration system.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.392
But it's gonna
be fine. Cabe and I

03:44.425 --> 03:45.526
are gonna stay back
and exercise.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.527
You can join us.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.695
TOBY:
Oh, that's great.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.430
I-I get lumped in with you two.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.633
You know, no offense,
but I have a 178 IQ!

03:52.666 --> 03:55.503
Incorrect.
Toby Curtis's IQ is 170,

03:55.536 --> 03:58.406
the lowest on Team Scorpion.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.346
Hey. You okay?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.349
How would you feel
if you were told

04:08.382 --> 04:09.650
you weren't wanted on a case?

04:09.683 --> 04:11.985
That's not it.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.654
You said you couldn't
feel any lower.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.656
Folks returning from their
honeymoon usually have

04:15.689 --> 04:17.658
a little more spring
in their step.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.793
Uh, we got a flat
on the way to Mexico,

04:19.827 --> 04:21.995
and Happy insisted on fixing it.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.598
And then our, um, ocean view

04:24.632 --> 04:26.734
could only be seen while
standing on a chair

04:26.767 --> 04:27.968
in the bathtub.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.804
And then when I complained to
the manager, he wouldn't budge.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.407
And to top it all off,
despite me checking

04:33.441 --> 04:35.042
every available
weather forecast,

04:35.075 --> 04:36.977
it rained the entire time.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.313
So, I failed on every front.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.582
But that's romantic.
Newlyweds, stuck in a room,

04:41.615 --> 04:43.651
rain pouring down.

04:43.684 --> 04:47.655
What? Toby, my only job here
on Scorpion is to help you guys.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.956
You need to trust me.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.991
Um...

04:54.595 --> 04:56.497
(quietly):
After all that happened,

04:56.530 --> 04:59.667
uh, my confidence was at zero.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.101
So...

05:01.134 --> 05:07.107
when the baby-making show
was supposed to commence...

05:07.140 --> 05:09.577
I couldn't raise the curtain.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.381
Oh.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.348
Well, that...

05:14.382 --> 05:15.349
I mean, that happens.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.850
It's no big deal.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.452
When you're trying
to get pregnant,

05:18.486 --> 05:20.588
it's a pretty big deal.
You know better

05:20.621 --> 05:21.455
than anyone
it's-it's probably all mental.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.656
You just need
to get your mojo back.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.058
Yeah, well, nothing makes you
feel manly like being told

05:25.092 --> 05:27.995
to stay behind while Florence
the Pixie takes your place.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.597
Did you mean
"Florence and the Machine"?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.098
Or the "Pixies"?

05:31.131 --> 05:33.501
Both are successful
indie rock bands.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.036
Seems like
something's wrong here.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.438
That's what Happy said.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.572
Huh?
Toby is

05:38.606 --> 05:42.410
just upset that Florence
is coming along when he isn't.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.413
Well, I can check
the filtration systems.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.947
Florence doesn't need to come.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.116
No, she has more chemistry
expertise than you.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.851
Besides,
she needs the work.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.520
Boosts our fee. Win-win.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.122
I just think it's unfair to Toby
to bring in an outsider.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.123
An outsider?

05:56.156 --> 05:56.990
She saved your life.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.792
I thought you were okay
with her now.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.794
I am, but...

06:00.828 --> 06:02.129
Good!
Then everything's settled.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.732
That's also what
Happy said.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.434
What are you talking about?

06:06.467 --> 06:07.568
No, never mind me.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.969
What's up with
lying to Paige?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.838
I read deception
all over you.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.105
And you could normally care less

06:12.139 --> 06:13.941
whether I find something unfair
or not.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.144
I need your professional opinion
about a dream I had.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.079
Did it involve leaving me behind
in the garage?

06:19.112 --> 06:21.415
(quietly):
No. It involved Florence and I

06:21.449 --> 06:22.883
kissing in the garage.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.418
I dreamt we were married.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.686
Yowza. Wow.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.888
Oh, that's why you don't want
her coming along.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.090
You feel guilty
about your perverted dream, huh?

06:30.123 --> 06:31.158
It wasn't perverse.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.025
It happened
when I was unconscious

06:32.059 --> 06:34.595
from falling down the stairs.
Mm-hmm.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.797
Toby, I th...
I thought I loved Paige.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.865
You can relax. The fact that

06:37.898 --> 06:40.534
you feel so guilty proves
that you do love her.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.671
Look, your dream is just
a function of biology, you know?

06:43.704 --> 06:46.540
You're unconscious, but the
olfactory and auditory centers

06:46.574 --> 06:48.476
of your brain continue
to provide stimuli.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.478
You know?
Florence found you,

06:50.511 --> 06:51.545
and she yelled at you
to wake up, right?

06:51.579 --> 06:53.747
So, you heard her--
she winds up in your dream.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.215
But my wife?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.917
Kissing me?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.652
She was trying
to keep you alive, right?

06:58.686 --> 07:00.153
She was caring for you.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.890
So your subconscious made her
someone that fits that role,

07:02.923 --> 07:04.157
a spouse.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.526
You did
nothing wrong.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.060
Thank you.
(chuckles softly)

07:07.094 --> 07:08.796
That's helpful.
Yeah.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.531
Well, try to get whatever
behaviorist SafeCorp hired

07:10.564 --> 07:11.732
to do that.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.102
So, can I come along?

07:15.135 --> 07:16.637
No.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.005
You know what, go ahead.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.239
I really don't give a crap.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.042
Laxatives are sold
in nine markets and pharmacies

07:22.075 --> 07:23.644
within
a three-mile radius.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.178
Shut up.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.551
Should I put in one of those
comms like you guys always wear?

07:30.584 --> 07:33.654
Not today. Bunker has shielding
that renders them useless.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.188
Hello, Team Scorpion.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.724
Quincy Berkstead?

07:36.757 --> 07:37.991
What are you doing here?
FLORENCE: Isn't he

07:38.025 --> 07:39.226
the pop psychologist
that sells books

07:39.259 --> 07:40.027
in supermarkets?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.862
By the millions.
SYLVESTER: You are

07:41.895 --> 07:43.263
the behaviorist
that SafeCorp hired?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.133
Not hired.
I received equity in the company

07:46.166 --> 07:48.268
in exchange for my work
in human dynamics,

07:48.301 --> 07:50.671
customizing the bunker so people
can live in it for years

07:50.704 --> 07:52.139
while keeping their sanity.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.274
Speaking of which,
I am about to lose mine.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.744
Walt, I am not working
with this jerk.

07:56.777 --> 07:57.845
Why do you guys hate him?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.647
He married Toby's ex-girlfriend.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.549
Stole Toby's ex-fiancÃ©e.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.283
He's a snake.
QUINCY: Please,

08:03.316 --> 08:05.753
don't let my past with Mr.
Curtis... HAPPY: Doctor

08:05.786 --> 08:07.721
Curtis.
My mistake.

08:07.755 --> 08:11.224
Don't let our past keep Scorpion
from a lucrative job.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.926
And we'd benefit
as well:

08:12.960 --> 08:14.261
a sign-off from a team
of geniuses

08:14.294 --> 08:16.664
would set buyers' minds at ease.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.832
You should be flattered
I chose you.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.301
I'm no psychiatrist, but maybe
your getting your jollies

08:21.334 --> 08:22.603
by humiliating my husband

08:22.636 --> 08:24.137
factored into
your decision.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.606
Toby got married?

08:25.639 --> 08:26.807
Fantastic.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.842
Then he's finally stopped pining
after my wife and it's all

08:28.876 --> 08:29.943
in the past
and we can get

08:29.977 --> 08:31.311
to work.
WALTER: Quincy, given

08:31.344 --> 08:32.580
the situation,
we can't accept the job.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.582
I need this job
done ASAP.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.117
I'll double your fee.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.254
We could give Toby a cut.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.790
It would hurt
Toby's feelings

08:42.823 --> 08:43.991
if he knew

08:44.024 --> 08:45.258
that we were working
with Quincy.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.994
Screw his feelings.
We need a bedroom set.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.996
Excellent.
Shall we?

08:51.264 --> 08:55.235
The entire bunker is run by
our AI module, Dorie. May she?

08:55.268 --> 08:59.006
Welcome, Walter O'Brien,
founder of Scorpion;

08:59.039 --> 09:01.341
Alderman Sylvester Dodd;

09:01.374 --> 09:04.612
Florence Tipton,
PhD in chemistry

09:04.645 --> 09:06.614
from the University of Texas;

09:06.647 --> 09:08.949
and Happy Quinn,
mechanical prodigy

09:08.982 --> 09:11.218
and pop star, alias Feliz.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.822
("Amigo AmigÃ¡vel" playing)

09:16.924 --> 09:18.859
Dorie's
a cutting-edge AI system.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.594
And the security
is no less advanced.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.263
Instead of a pickable lock
or a hackable password,

09:23.296 --> 09:27.267
the owner can gain access
by blowing on this sensor.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.703
National Institutes
of Health Study recently found

09:29.737 --> 09:31.972
each person
has unique gut flora.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.373
Like a gastronomic fingerprint.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.507
Exactly.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.844
Eventually, it will be
programmed for the purchaser.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.812
For now, it's set up for me.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.349
(beeps)

09:44.184 --> 09:45.653
This way.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.621
Uh, can we leave
the door open?

09:47.655 --> 09:49.923
I'm a teensy
claustrophobic.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.725
Not a problem.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.330
Bunker's unfinished,

09:57.364 --> 09:59.867
but security mechanisms
are complete.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.335
Intercoms, cameras.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.005
Six-foot-thick
steel walls encase

10:05.038 --> 10:06.406
composite carbon graphene.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.875
It can withstand
a nuclear blast.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.409
Owners can wait out

10:09.442 --> 10:11.879
an apocalyptic scenario
in comfort for five years.

10:17.718 --> 10:21.354
To prevent claustrophobia,
it even has windows.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.356
When completed,
there'll be thousands of vistas

10:23.390 --> 10:25.025
to choose from.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.696
For now, I've put in photos
Amy and I took on our honeymoon.

10:28.729 --> 10:29.963
That's Amy?
Yes.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.800
Not only beautiful,
but a very accomplished

10:32.833 --> 10:34.134
geneticist.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.869
This is us riding
on Jimbaran Beach.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.739
Took those balloons
right across Nusa Dua.

10:38.772 --> 10:39.740
Breathtaking.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.742
Just like our honeymoon.
Enjoyed Bali so much,

10:41.775 --> 10:43.143
we bought a second home there.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.312
Well, second vacation home.
TOBY: Have no fear!

10:45.345 --> 10:49.216
The real psychiatrist is here!

10:51.251 --> 10:52.786
Quincy Berkstead?

10:52.820 --> 10:53.787
SYLVESTER:
Toby!

10:53.821 --> 10:55.422
What are you doing here?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.691
Well, I had to see
why I was left on the bench.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.826
For this guy?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.427
Seriously?
WALTER: I told

11:00.460 --> 11:03.697
Happy you'd be mad,
but sh-she wanted furniture.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.132
Okay, Quincy is part
owner of SafeCorp.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.433
He made the call
to keep you back.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.301
You really shouldn't
be here, Toby.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.437
You excluded me 'cause you're
threatened by my intellect.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.940
Intellect?
The last time I saw you,

11:12.973 --> 11:14.374
you feigned throwing acid
in my face.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.410
Oh, just get over it, baby. I'm telling
you, you don't want to be here.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.412
Why? 'Cause I'd show you up?
AMY: Quincy, really?

11:19.446 --> 11:21.314
Nobody wants to
see me in my bikini.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.416
All I did was eat
that entire trip.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.718
What'd you eat? Air?

11:24.752 --> 11:26.086
Amy?

11:26.119 --> 11:28.255
Toby?

11:28.288 --> 11:30.257
Is that you under all that?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.725
QUINCY: You need to leave!
This is

11:31.759 --> 11:32.960
a high-tech facility.
High-tech?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.461
Quincy, do you realize
that I got past...

11:34.494 --> 11:36.296
Don't! ...your stupid AI
with this cheap scarf!

11:36.329 --> 11:39.032
(alarm blaring)

11:39.066 --> 11:41.902
DORIE:
Protocol One initiated.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.771
I'm guessing that's
not a good protocol?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.472
It's on lockdown.
We need to get out.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.440
Too late!

11:47.474 --> 11:49.076
Dorie, open the exit.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.477
DORIE:
Request denied.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.479
Enemy infiltration detected.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.482
Quincy, did you program me
into the system as an enemy?!

11:55.515 --> 11:58.151
Dorie warns of any strangers,
but responds proactively

11:58.185 --> 11:59.820
to pre-programmed threats.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.121
I needed a placeholder

12:01.154 --> 12:04.091
for demonstration purposes,
and you tortured me.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.259
Only psychologically! AMY: Look, if
Dorie thinks that Toby is a threat,

12:06.293 --> 12:07.995
why is she locking us
in with him?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.863
Dorie knows where Toby is,
and she's contained him.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.498
The fact that
he's trapped in with us

12:11.531 --> 12:13.166
is a problem
she'll try to solve next.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.902
Solve me?
What is that, a euphemism?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.269
WALTER:
AI is patient.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.905
It'll hold us in here
until it figures out

12:17.938 --> 12:19.773
what to do,
and that could take years.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.008
Can we drill our way out?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.543
It would take weeks with a laser
saw, and we don't have one.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.779
We can decipher this conundrum,
and if it takes a few days,

12:25.813 --> 12:27.514
at least we have a supply
of water and food.

12:27.547 --> 12:28.916
QUINCY: Wrong.
Since the bunker's

12:28.949 --> 12:30.150
still under construction,

12:30.183 --> 12:31.985
it's only been stocked
with cleaning supplies.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.854
There is no food or water,

12:33.887 --> 12:36.389
and only enough air
for 24 hours.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.759
Well, this is the last job
I'm going on with you people.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.898
âª

12:51.571 --> 12:54.007
All right, just take deep
breaths, hold and exhale.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.543
(exhales)

12:56.576 --> 12:58.011
Great job, Quince.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.980
Really dynamite product
you designed here.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.049
Okay, clam it, Doc. It's not helping.
TOBY: No, Happy.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.183
What isn't helping is

13:03.216 --> 13:05.919
this talk show doctor's
death silo locking us in a tomb.

13:05.953 --> 13:09.222
Toby, you're not really gonna
blame Quincy for this, are you?

13:09.256 --> 13:12.993
I mean, you showed up uninvited.
You set off the alarm.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.095
Remember when we used to
talk about your inability

13:15.128 --> 13:17.430
to take responsibility
for your actions?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.201
You're right.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.502
I'm sorry.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.137
FLORENCE:
Okay, you guys stopped

13:24.171 --> 13:25.873
a nuclear satellite,

13:25.906 --> 13:28.341
a runaway cargo ship
and an extinction event.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.011
You can't get us out
of a hole in the ground?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.880
There's no cell signal.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.248
The emergency phone was just
installed a few days ago.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.884
On it.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.887
You never showed me pictures
of Amy. Now I know why.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.121
What? Her?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.589
She's ugly.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.027
(phone rings) Oh. Hey, Walt.
How's bunker life?

13:47.060 --> 13:48.862
WALTER: AI locked us in here.
We need help.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.198
DORIE:
Shutting down communications.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.403
Cabe, team's in trouble.
We need to call SafeCorp.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.271
Coming!

13:58.305 --> 14:01.341
Take the damn
parachute off!

14:01.374 --> 14:02.910
Nothing is working.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.078
Dorie,
turn communications back on.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.446
Negative. I must prevent

14:06.479 --> 14:09.349
Tobias Curtis
from contacting other threats.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.119
You know what? It's okay. Cabe and Paige
know we're in here. TOBY: Walt, no offense,

14:12.152 --> 14:14.121
but you got the Globetrotters
of Scorpion in here

14:14.154 --> 14:16.389
and you're waiting for the
Washington Generals to save us?

14:16.423 --> 14:18.591
I don't understand
that reference, but...

14:18.625 --> 14:20.360
your tone was sarcastic.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.129
So, either stop
complaining,

14:22.162 --> 14:23.463
or come up with a solution.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.132
I'm feeling
a little bit stuffy in here.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.967
Is anybody else
feeling stuffy?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.235
Okay, Toby, calm
this kid down.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.103
Uh, Quincy, are
there any systems

14:30.137 --> 14:31.371
that are functional or completed

14:31.404 --> 14:32.906
in this joint?
Uh, bathrooms,

14:32.940 --> 14:35.008
gaming system, gym,
trash compactor.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.077
AMY:
That's it! The trash compactor.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.046
It has hydraulics.
We can remove them

14:39.079 --> 14:39.980
and then use them

14:40.013 --> 14:41.581
to force the door open.
That's brilliant.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.283
Outstanding.
Terrific.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.252
Whatever. WALTER: Okay, Happy,

14:45.285 --> 14:46.219
Quincy and I will

14:46.253 --> 14:47.587
go work on the
hydraulics.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.621
Amy, Sly and Flo,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.423
you go to the control room,
try to override Dorie.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.225
Computers and code
aren't really my strength.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.460
Perhaps I should go with you?

14:53.493 --> 14:55.195
No. We got it.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.196
Off you go.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.131
Come on. I'll show you
where the control room is.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.166
And I'll take you
to the compactor.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.500
Whoa, whoa. Don't I get a job?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.069
Oh, I have a job for you.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.039
Why is there so much garbage

15:06.073 --> 15:08.241
in an unmanned bunker?
QUINCY: Construction workers

15:08.275 --> 15:11.011
need a place to toss their
excess construction materials.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.046
And their lunch remnants.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.714
Just unscrew the maintenance
panel like Happy asked.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.116
Phillips-head.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.422
You know, I'm doing this
because Happy said to,

15:22.455 --> 15:24.124
not because you said to.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.026
Remember,
I'm the alpha dog here.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.295
Been published way more
than you have, Wimpy.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.562
DORIE:
Initial search shows

15:29.596 --> 15:33.033
Dr. Berkstead has published
nine more papers

15:33.066 --> 15:34.167
than Tobias Curtis.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.735
Son of a...

15:35.768 --> 15:39.106
He has also appeared
on over 100 episodes

15:39.139 --> 15:41.341
of syndicated
daytime television.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.276
Quincy's an impressive guy.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.677
Figures he'd marry Wonder Woman.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.280
The cartoon Amazon
with an invisible plane?

15:47.314 --> 15:48.248
(scoffs)

15:48.281 --> 15:49.282
It's ridiculous.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.118
You don't think
Amy's that great?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.119
Oh, no. She's quite impressive.

15:52.152 --> 15:55.288
I meant, the invisible plane
is ridiculous.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.457
DARPA's decades away from
developing an invisible plane.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.759
Just wrench the damn hydraulics.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.328
SYLVESTER:
I am getting nowhere fast.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.395
I can't reverse
Dorie's programming.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.663
She blocks my every move.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.232
It's like playing a
chess grandmaster.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.467
Well, I'm sorry
that I'm no help.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.070
I could have at least
been useful with the hydraulics,

16:10.103 --> 16:12.005
but Walter seemed very averse
to that idea.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.106
Which is strange.
No.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.242
What is strange is that
a machine that is programmed

16:15.275 --> 16:17.077
to protect people is going
to kill us.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.111
Computers are logical.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.214
Any contradiction or paradox
is beyond their grasp.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.249
I'm running in circles here.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.052
Let's just hope Cabe
and Paige are making progress.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.519
Doesn't look like
he wants any visitors.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.322
Apparently Claus Egan is our
only shot. Ring the bell.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.058
(buzzer sounds)

16:31.091 --> 16:33.060
EGAN:
Yeah?

16:33.093 --> 16:35.062
Mr. Egan, we were sent here
by SafeCorp.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.564
Our colleagues are trapped
in one of your bunkers.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.200
Get the hell off my property!

16:40.233 --> 16:41.534
Sir, our friends will be dead

16:41.568 --> 16:43.336
before emergency personnel
get to them.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.372
SafeCorp said you know
the system better than anyone

16:45.405 --> 16:48.341
'cause you designed it,
and you're the only person

16:48.375 --> 16:49.676
who can save
our friends' lives.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.710
(line clicks)

16:51.744 --> 16:54.347
(buzzer sounds)

16:59.752 --> 17:01.388
(quietly):
This guy seems nuts.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.623
He let us in.
He must want to help.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.658
(shotgun cocks)

17:10.763 --> 17:12.799
Or not.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.102
Panel's off.
Now I just got to turn off

17:15.135 --> 17:17.770
the electrical current
controlling the hydraulics

17:17.804 --> 17:19.406
so Walt and Happy
can remove them

17:19.439 --> 17:20.607
without getting electrocuted.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.209
(alarm blares)

17:22.242 --> 17:23.776
Hey, Quincy. What the hell?

17:23.810 --> 17:25.145
Hey, stop messing with me!

17:25.178 --> 17:26.346
I'm not doing it!

17:29.616 --> 17:31.184
The door won't open!

17:31.218 --> 17:34.187
Guys, uh, the trash compactor
is compacting,

17:34.221 --> 17:36.489
and Toby is still in it.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.292
It's Dorie. She waited
until Toby was in the compactor,

17:39.326 --> 17:41.294
and once the panel was removed,
she knew

17:41.328 --> 17:43.296
that we were close
to executing an escape plan.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.431
She locked him in there!

17:44.464 --> 17:45.332
HAPPY:
It'll crush him alive!

17:45.365 --> 17:46.499
Sly, do something!

17:46.533 --> 17:48.268
Dorie, you were designed
to compact trash,

17:48.301 --> 17:50.303
but there's something in there
that's not trash!

17:50.337 --> 17:51.538
DORIE:
Trash has no value.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.406
A threat has negative value.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.608
Tobias Curtis is a threat.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.278
Therefore,
Tobias Curtis is trash.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.413
Hey, Dorie, why don't you
cram it up your motherboard?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.615
Okay, only shot is
to unscrew these hydraulics.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.384
Toby, buy us some time!

18:04.417 --> 18:05.718
I can handle this.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.121
I've seen Star Wars
a thousand times.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.756
Oh!

18:12.325 --> 18:15.528
Ah! Ah!
I Han Solo'd your ass!

18:15.562 --> 18:17.430
(creaking)

18:17.464 --> 18:19.699
No, no! Oh, no! Whoa! Aah!

18:19.732 --> 18:20.867
Hurry! Hurry!

18:20.900 --> 18:22.569
Oh, we'll never
get this done in time!

18:23.670 --> 18:25.138
It's getting a little tight
in here.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.339
Screw it.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.476
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.449
(yelping)

18:36.483 --> 18:37.784
Compactor stopped!

18:39.486 --> 18:41.488
It's too late.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.331
DORIE: Trash compactor reset
to original position.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.311
We fought our entire honeymoon.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.913
From the flat tire to his

19:06.946 --> 19:11.918
stupid neurosis
over his romantic issues.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.486
TOBY:
Are you kidding me?!

19:13.520 --> 19:14.387
Toby?!

19:14.421 --> 19:15.588
Yeah, I'm down here!

19:15.622 --> 19:17.790
I'm under the floor...
with my self-esteem.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.661
A drain?

19:21.694 --> 19:22.929
HAPPY:
There's a small hatch here.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.198
TOBY:
I found it in the nick of time.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.900
It collects all the garbage
juice, and I'm in it. Hooray.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.869
I can't believe you're alive.
I can't believe

19:29.902 --> 19:31.838
you brought up my procreation
procrastination.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.574
That's the kind of thing
spouses keep between themselves.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.908
Hey, we have bigger problems

19:35.942 --> 19:38.611
than your inability to
perform your marital duties.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.312
Just leave me in here.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.112
Happy smashed the hydraulics.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.681
Speaking of things
that don't work...

19:41.714 --> 19:42.449
Watch it, Wimpy.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.783
Okay, without
the hydraulics,

19:43.816 --> 19:44.851
we can't pry open the door;

19:44.884 --> 19:46.353
we're back at square one.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.454
QUINCY:
Wrong attitude.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.756
If you were one of the millions
who read my last book,

19:49.789 --> 19:51.624
you'd know my number one
Quincyism--

19:51.658 --> 19:55.495
ATP: Always
Think Positive.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.764
They're all gonna die.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.799
I warned SafeCorp

19:59.832 --> 20:02.869
not to use AI,
but they replaced me

20:02.902 --> 20:05.972
with some whiz kids who said
computers were the future

20:06.005 --> 20:08.808
'cause humans can be unstable.
(laughs)

20:08.841 --> 20:11.778
Maybe some are
so unstable

20:11.811 --> 20:13.646
that they come onto my land,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.348
making up stories.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.385
Maybe you two work for SafeCorp.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.953
We know exactly where
you're coming from.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.489
You don't know who to trust.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.656
You've dedicated your life

20:23.690 --> 20:25.958
to your work-- blood, sweat
and tears-- then one day,

20:25.992 --> 20:28.661
younger people with way less
experience just come in

20:28.695 --> 20:30.330
and take over.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.598
Damn right they do.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.732
And it's not right.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.467
But now is your chance
to fight back.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.370
Your chance to outsmart
their precious AI,

20:37.404 --> 20:39.872
but only if you believe that
we're telling you the truth.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.784
Hey, hold on now.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.456
(grunts softly)

20:59.692 --> 21:01.561
I'll get my blueprints.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.467
Great speech.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.469
Sounded familiar.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.937
I learned from the best.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.639
EGAN:
Key to life?

21:12.672 --> 21:15.074
Timing is everything.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.477
(laughs) And there's
always a chance

21:17.510 --> 21:21.080
when Armageddon comes
and hellfire rains down,

21:21.113 --> 21:23.450
I won't be in one of my bunkers,

21:23.483 --> 21:25.918
while some rich
Silicon Valley

21:25.952 --> 21:27.920
blowhard's already
sittin' pretty

21:27.954 --> 21:30.457
in a top-flight shelter
I designed.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.792
So, I needed
to figure out a way

21:32.825 --> 21:34.427
to take over one
of those bunkers

21:34.461 --> 21:36.429
to survive end-times.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.998
Makes perfect sense.
So,

21:39.031 --> 21:41.701
I built this secret entrance.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.836
Behind the heater
in this utility closet,

21:43.870 --> 21:46.005
there's a hatch leading

21:46.038 --> 21:50.743
to an exhaust shaft which sits
on top of an industrial fan.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.679
And our friends could climb out.
Oh, no.

21:52.712 --> 21:53.946
Shaft's 30 feet high.

21:53.980 --> 21:57.884
Uh, steel walls,
zero friction coefficient.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.819
Well, how were you gonna get in?
Rope.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.754
Or braided deer intestines.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.523
But first
we're gonna need

22:03.556 --> 22:05.992
to get a message
to your friends,

22:06.025 --> 22:07.694
tell them where
to find the hatch.

22:07.727 --> 22:10.096
Well, how?
They don't have cell reception.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.631
(chuckles)

22:13.833 --> 22:15.502
With this.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.939
Thought you said
you hated computers.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.942
I like to watch Antique Hunters.
(laughs)

22:24.744 --> 22:26.846
SYLVESTER:
Toby!

22:26.879 --> 22:27.914
Thank God you're alive.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.383
Don't get too close--
you were just in garbage.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.718
FLORENCE:
What are we gonna do,

22:31.751 --> 22:33.586
now that the hydraulics are broken?
I don't know.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.855
Why don't we ask Quincy
and his Murder-Bot 3000.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.023
AMY:
Toby, come on.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.991
You're better
than comments like that.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.527
Look, you just went through

22:40.560 --> 22:41.994
a very terrifying
experience, and you're

22:42.028 --> 22:43.062
taking it out on Quincy.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.131
I'm sorry.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.033
You kidding me? What is she, your mom?
(beeping)

22:47.066 --> 22:48.568
You guys hear
that beeping?

22:48.601 --> 22:50.169
It's coming from the kitchen.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.539
(beeping stops)

22:53.973 --> 22:56.409
WALTER:
Unbelievable.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.077
Looks like
the Washington Generals

22:58.110 --> 23:00.447
just scored a touchdown.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.849
EGAN: Okay, they should have
gotten the message by now

23:02.882 --> 23:04.484
if they were anywhere
near the kitchen.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.085
(gasps):
Oh, my...

23:06.118 --> 23:07.086
(groans with frustration)

23:07.119 --> 23:10.623
Power surge. The bunker's
AI is retaliating

23:10.657 --> 23:11.958
for being hacked.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.660
I've done all
I can from here.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.662
But be careful,
because who knows

23:15.695 --> 23:18.431
what kind of security
they put up after I left.

23:18.465 --> 23:19.599
Okay, thank you for everything.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.900
Yeah, we got to go.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.879
Microwave was right.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.881
That's our way out.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.851
It looks like the
exhaust shaft opening

23:38.885 --> 23:40.587
is about 200 yards
from the bunker entrance.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.122
That's why we didn't see it
when we came in. But, guys,

23:43.155 --> 23:44.256
the microwave is
on Dorie's server,

23:44.290 --> 23:46.759
so she read the plan that was sent to us.
How could she

23:46.793 --> 23:48.094
stop someone
from walking up to a shaft

23:48.127 --> 23:50.129
and dropping a rope down?
Well, we're in a room

23:50.162 --> 23:51.864
where the walls
don't compact, so...

23:51.898 --> 23:55.001
seems like we beat you
at your game, didn't we, Doris?

23:55.034 --> 23:56.268
DORIE:
Yes. That is how it seems.

23:56.302 --> 23:59.138
Okay, so we just wait for Cabe
and Paige to get here with rope,

23:59.171 --> 24:00.740
and then
we're home free.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.074
I still get paid, right?

24:06.779 --> 24:09.448
Looks like we have
some time to kill.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.121
Look, I get that
you don't like me,

24:15.154 --> 24:18.190
but for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.626
Seriously?

24:19.659 --> 24:21.127
Yeah.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.263
You're a foot taller,
three times girlier,

24:24.296 --> 24:27.033
a bikini model geneticist

24:27.066 --> 24:28.134
with a house in Bali,

24:28.167 --> 24:31.037
who has a Svengali power
over my husband.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.972
Plus, getting
a look at you,

24:33.005 --> 24:36.108
now I can see why our honeymoon
went the way it did.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.912
You have no reason
to be jealous of me, Happy.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.648
(distant thud)
Trust me.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.082
(gas hissing)
Wait, what's that sound?

24:43.115 --> 24:44.751
Reality smacking me in the face.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.118
No, it's coming
from the pipes.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.020
Everyone,
did you hear that?

24:48.054 --> 24:49.989
DORIE:
Protocol Two initialized.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.057
Oh, no.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.224
What's Protocol Two?

24:52.258 --> 24:54.093
Protocol One
was defensive:

24:54.126 --> 24:56.228
lockdown when
a threat's detected.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.797
Protocol Two
is offensive:

24:57.830 --> 24:59.799
peremptory attack.
What does that mean?

24:59.832 --> 25:00.600
WALTER:
It means

25:00.633 --> 25:03.169
Dorie's activating
an external gas

25:03.202 --> 25:04.671
dispersal system.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.839
She's gonna spray VX9
to stop intruders.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.241
I saw a tank of it
in the bunker schematics.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.644
VX9? That is
a deadly neurotoxin.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.580
Cabe and Paige are on their way.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.147
VX9 is colorless and odorless.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.116
They'll run
right into it and die.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.652
Along with everyone else
within a ten-mile radius.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.854
But Dorie said we won the game.
No, actually, that little minx

25:21.888 --> 25:23.322
said it seemed like
we had won the game,

25:23.355 --> 25:24.891
because it seemed
that way to us.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.325
She was getting this attack
ready the whole time.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.661
How long will it take
to mix and disperse the gas?

25:28.695 --> 25:30.863
20 minutes.
I'll set a timer.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.865
Okay, well,
we might be able to stop...

25:37.303 --> 25:39.171
(whispering):
Let's huddle, huddle, huddle.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.273
Okay, so...

25:45.011 --> 25:47.814
Okay, so if Dorie can
hear what we're up to,

25:47.847 --> 25:51.217
it'll sabotage our plans.
Quincy, can Dorie's microphones

25:51.250 --> 25:53.586
pick us up
at this decibel level?

25:53.620 --> 25:56.789
No. The voice command technology
requires clear audio.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.958
Okay, good.
Now, we don't have enough time

25:58.991 --> 26:00.159
to stop the release
of the gas.

26:00.192 --> 26:03.195
But the neurotoxins operate best
in an acidic environment,

26:03.229 --> 26:04.964
so we can neutralize it.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.298
FLORENCE: Yeah, it's basic
chemistry. We can do that

26:06.332 --> 26:08.635
by adding a strong base,
like sodium hydroxide.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.937
We can make that
from the cleaning supplies.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.138
I'll need help.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.606
Walter, you have more
chemistry experience

26:13.640 --> 26:14.841
than the others.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.175
Huh?

26:16.208 --> 26:17.910
Fine.
HAPPY: I can build

26:17.944 --> 26:18.911
a one-way valve
to deliver

26:18.945 --> 26:21.047
the neutralizing agents
into the toxin chamber.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.083
I'll need an extra pair of hands, too.
I use micro tools

26:24.116 --> 26:26.318
all the time in my line of work,
so I'll assist.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.254
Yay.
Toby,

26:28.287 --> 26:29.188
Quincy, unscrew

26:29.221 --> 26:31.257
the access conduit
to the toxin chambers

26:31.290 --> 26:32.992
so that it's
ready for when

26:33.025 --> 26:34.226
Happy is done
building her valve.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.127
And then, Sly,

26:35.161 --> 26:37.830
just try your best
to slow Dorie down.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.900
Find anything?

26:42.234 --> 26:45.271
Powdered cleanser--
it's full of sodium carbonate.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.807
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.277
What?
Huh? Nothing.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.719
I thought we had
gotten past our differences,

26:59.752 --> 27:01.287
but you seem upset with me.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.389
(water stops)
Me?

27:03.422 --> 27:05.958
No, I'm not.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.395
Must be the stress of
being trapped underground.

27:14.366 --> 27:18.437
Making an injection valve out of
an HVAC tube's pretty ingenious.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.207
I got to admit, you're
kind of intimidating.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.209
Don't patronize me.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.377
I'm not patronizing you.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.146
Look, you see some
photos on a wall,

27:27.179 --> 27:28.380
and you think
that you know me?

27:28.414 --> 27:30.016
I mean, a genius should know

27:30.049 --> 27:32.018
that photos don't always
tell the whole story.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.353
Oh, why, is there a fourth house
I don't know about?

27:34.386 --> 27:36.789
You're being mean because
you feel threatened by me.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.791
No, I'm not threatened.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.360
I'm just a purveyor
of the facts.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.163
And the fact is, between you
and me, I used to think

27:44.196 --> 27:46.398
that I was the winner
'cause I got Toby--

27:46.432 --> 27:49.268
as much as anyone who gets Toby
can be called a winner--

27:49.301 --> 27:50.870
but now that I've met you,

27:50.903 --> 27:54.006
I realize I was
his consolation pick.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.476
Truth is, Quincy
lined up our honeymoon

27:57.509 --> 27:59.411
to Bali with a conference.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.247
All the photos were staged,

28:01.280 --> 28:03.315
and 36 hours after
we were there,

28:03.349 --> 28:05.284
he left to go to a
speaking engagement.

28:05.317 --> 28:08.387
But that's what it's like
to be married to Quincy.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.223
I will always come
after his career.

28:11.257 --> 28:14.093
And it was the same
thing with Toby...

28:14.126 --> 28:16.495
except it wasn't business,
it was gambling.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.364
So you're not
the only one

28:18.397 --> 28:21.233
who knows what it feels
like to be a second choice.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.372
I don't know why
I'm telling you that.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.975
'Cause I was a jerk earlier,

28:29.008 --> 28:30.509
and I needed
to be told

28:30.542 --> 28:33.345
to see things
from someone else's perspective?

28:33.379 --> 28:35.081
Sorry.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.384
It's okay.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.788
Toby doesn't gamble anymore.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.256
He quit gambling? How?

28:44.290 --> 28:46.458
Well, if he didn't,
I would have walked.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.062
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

28:50.096 --> 28:52.799
he wouldn't do that
for a consolation pick.

28:54.867 --> 28:57.804
That as hard as you can turn?
Come on, go faster.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.306
The bolt is difficult to turn.
We're going as fast as we can.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.408
Yeah, well, your "as
fast as you can" sucks.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.043
(chuckles):
Typical.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.512
What? You are attacking
my physical prowess

29:06.545 --> 29:08.214
at one activity,

29:08.247 --> 29:09.481
because you have insecurities

29:09.515 --> 29:12.084
about your own prowess
at another activity.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.419
I'm not talking about this
with you, Quincy.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.553
Well, maybe you should.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.422
I'm a doctor--
I'd like to help.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.124
And I can tell you

29:18.157 --> 29:19.992
it's all in your head,
because Amy informed me

29:20.026 --> 29:22.328
that you never had any issues
when you two were together.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.930
You talked about this with Amy?

29:23.963 --> 29:26.198
Well, I wanted to make sure
that it wasn't a symptom

29:26.232 --> 29:27.433
of a larger biological issue.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.568
She has a PhD.
I was looking out for you.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.038
You were looking to humiliate me.
Easy.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.106
You are wrenching too hard.
I got this, all right?

29:34.140 --> 29:35.908
I'm not as useless
as you think.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.877
You are making a feeble attempt
to prove your manhood,

29:37.910 --> 29:39.445
and it is going
to strip the bolt!

29:39.478 --> 29:41.580
(straining):
I know what I'm doing!

29:41.613 --> 29:42.949
(bolt snaps)

29:44.250 --> 29:46.518
You see what you made me do?

29:46.552 --> 29:48.187
You got to be kidding!

29:48.220 --> 29:50.089
BOTH:
He did it!

29:51.323 --> 29:53.960
Okay. The hole's
too big to patch

29:53.993 --> 29:55.527
before the toxins
get pumped through.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.529
Now it won't just spray
the gas outside.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.598
It'll spray into this bunker.
Killing us all.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.133
Sly.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.501
How long till disperse-ment?

30:02.534 --> 30:03.335
Nine minutes.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.171
We got to get Dorie
to stop the gas.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.505
SYLVESTER:
I can't get through her system.

30:06.538 --> 30:07.473
She's smarter than me.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.508
That's nonsense.
Nobody is smarter than you.

30:09.541 --> 30:12.211
Except for me and Ralph and four
other people I've read about.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.513
TOBY: Sly, you can stop the gas.
You-you said earlier

30:14.546 --> 30:16.515
that AI can't handle
a paradox, right?

30:16.548 --> 30:18.951
Well, if you give it
a real head-scratcher,

30:18.985 --> 30:20.386
then all its computing power
is gonna be directed

30:20.419 --> 30:21.420
toward solving it,
and we can

30:21.453 --> 30:22.521
slip a directive
into its mainframe.

30:22.554 --> 30:26.926
Dorie, you are familiar
with metaphysical solipsism?

30:26.959 --> 30:29.628
DORIE: Metaphysical solipsism
is a philosophical theory.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.030
Correct.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.565
It contends
that nothing truly exists

30:33.599 --> 30:36.035
outside of one's mind.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.470
So technically,
Toby doesn't exist.

30:38.504 --> 30:42.308
And you don't need to eliminate
something that doesn't exist.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.911
Hence, you don't need
to eliminate Toby.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.646
My sensors detect
Tobias Curtis's breathing

30:47.679 --> 30:50.449
and thermal energy;
therefore, he exists.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.418
Metaphysical solipsism is wrong.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.287
This is why I hated
philosophy class.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.589
Toby, hold your breath. She's
right-- it's all about breath.

30:57.623 --> 31:00.192
Uh, how do I stop generating heat?
Not yo breath,

31:00.226 --> 31:00.993
Quincy's breath.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.528
If Sly can get
Dorie preoccupied

31:02.561 --> 31:04.163
with some unsolvable
conundrum,

31:04.196 --> 31:05.932
then her processor
will be vulnerable.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.466
And then if we
can get Quincy topside,

31:07.499 --> 31:09.001
he could use
his gastro-print

31:09.035 --> 31:10.402
to access the
front-door computer

31:10.436 --> 31:12.104
and slip an order
to stop the gas attack

31:12.138 --> 31:15.274
past Dorie's defenses.
Yes! Quincy, you can do this...

31:15.307 --> 31:16.542
AMY:
Quincy?

31:16.575 --> 31:18.044
Wha...
Hey.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.611
Come out.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.680
We need you.
I'm sorry, I can't.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.215
Quincy, what are you doing?
This room

31:23.249 --> 31:24.383
is hermetically sealed.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.218
It'll be safe
when the gas comes.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.287
Did you ever think
we want to be in there?

31:28.320 --> 31:29.688
Or how about all the people
in the kill radius

31:29.721 --> 31:30.923
around the bunker you designed?

31:30.957 --> 31:32.624
There's limited
oxygen in here.

31:32.658 --> 31:33.559
I'm sorry.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.627
I am not opening the door.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.072
You dirty little
snake in the glass!

31:46.105 --> 31:47.506
Look, I am your wife.
Are you kidding me?

31:47.539 --> 31:49.675
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
it's very hard to hear in here.

31:49.708 --> 31:52.178
Guys, forget about him.
We don't need him.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.346
We need his gut flora,
and he's providing us that

31:54.380 --> 31:57.683
by locking himself
in this airtight room.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.518
I think I get
where you're going.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.721
This carbon scrubber
filters the storage room's air.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.256
He's been in there
hyperventilating

32:04.290 --> 32:05.257
like a baby for the past minute.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.725
It's got to have
some of his microbes in here.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.961
If we isolate
his larger gut flora

32:08.995 --> 32:11.630
into an airtight container,
we can blow it into the sensor.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.636
We create static on the wire
and drag it across the scrubber,

32:17.669 --> 32:18.704
the charged flora molecules
will stick to it,

32:18.737 --> 32:21.607
and then we put the wire
into a compressed air can

32:21.640 --> 32:23.742
that I carry to clean my
tools, and we're good to go.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.743
Let's go get that can.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.445
Okay.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.614
Yeah. Now, we need to create
a powerful enough

32:28.647 --> 32:30.749
electrostatic charge.
We can do that

32:30.782 --> 32:33.552
by rubbing your polyester jacket
against my wool sweater.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.589
Ooh, ooh...

32:37.623 --> 32:40.426
Take it off first.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.562
There is a plane crash.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.198
Every single person
on board dies,

32:46.232 --> 32:48.067
but yet,
there are two survivors.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.101
How is this possible?

32:49.135 --> 32:51.037
Every single person died.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.372
The two that survived
were married.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.341
Son of a brain teaser.
All right, smarty,

32:55.374 --> 32:56.642
try this one on.

32:56.675 --> 33:00.046
How does someone
lift an elephant with one hand?

33:00.079 --> 33:03.682
They do not, as there are
no elephants with one hand.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.584
Or two hands, for that matter.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.686
Damn, you're good.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.726
Guys, Cabe and Paige
just drove onto the property.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.662
They have no idea that the gas
will be released soon.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.064
They'll be dead in five minutes.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.737
Crap. Can't throw the
rope down the shaft

33:25.771 --> 33:28.574
if we can't get past that.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.509
Egan said there'd be some
security surprises.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.643
TOBY:
Hey, Paige!

33:31.677 --> 33:33.645
Cabe! Can you hear me? Toby,

33:33.679 --> 33:35.381
we're out here,
but there's an electric fence

33:35.414 --> 33:36.682
around the exhaust shaft.

33:36.715 --> 33:39.318
Look, neurotoxic gas
is gonna flood where you are

33:39.351 --> 33:41.053
in minutes.
We can stop it,

33:41.087 --> 33:42.654
but we need you
to send down that rope.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.390
Well, we can't
get it to you.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.757
Egan said the exhaust shaft

33:45.791 --> 33:47.726
is over an industrial fan.
Is that right, Toby?

33:47.759 --> 33:50.262
Yeah, but I left my Mary Poppins
umbrella at home.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.764
We don't need an umbrella.
We have a parachute.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.134
That's too light.
The fan'll blow it back out.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.303
Nope, not if we use this.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.671
Toby, Cabe's gonna try
and throw the parachute

33:59.705 --> 34:00.672
down into the shaft.
Step back.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.809
All right, Cabe.
Look, hey, buddy, I know you can

34:03.842 --> 34:05.043
make this shot.

34:05.077 --> 34:07.746
Sure wish I didn't call 'em
the Washington Generals earlier.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.148
You know who could
make this shot?

34:09.181 --> 34:10.516
Is one of the young
Homeland recruits

34:10.549 --> 34:12.251
who can pass a fitness test
without even trying.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.786
You're trying to piss me off
to psych me up.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.223
Working?
Yep.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.664
There's not enough
of the wire

34:25.697 --> 34:27.766
between the fabric--
move closer.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.805
Closer. It's static electricity,
not real electricity.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.175
Okay, I popped the top
of the air canister.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.676
And I'm covering it
so it doesn't lose pressure.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.311
Give me the wire.
It should have

34:39.345 --> 34:40.512
enough charge by now.

34:40.546 --> 34:41.713
Right.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.715
Here. The scrubber.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.118
Look, I know it's invisible, but
I have a really good feeling

34:46.152 --> 34:47.253
we're getting what we need
off this thing.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.221
I really wish I could help, Amy.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.823
You know me
and my survival instinct issues.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.759
They're actually why
I was drawn to this business

34:53.792 --> 34:54.793
in the first place.

34:54.826 --> 34:58.297
Something for us to explore
when this is all over.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.765
What the hell is that?

34:59.798 --> 35:02.168
Uh, there's a
change of plans.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.802
There's a huge
electrical fence,

35:03.835 --> 35:05.771
so Paige and Cabe
can't get to us.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.873
I got to go up the chimney
like old Saint Nick.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.577
And if you land on the fence?

35:11.610 --> 35:12.844
Toby fricassee.
But Paige and Cabe

35:12.878 --> 35:15.447
are ready with the car to race
me over to the control panel.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.384
Which will be meaningless
if Sly doesn't distract Dorie.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.320
Sly, Toby's almost out of here.
So, time and progress update?

35:21.353 --> 35:22.888
SYLVESTER:
Down to two minutes.

35:22.921 --> 35:25.924
I'm trying my best, but
I'm down to knock-knock jokes.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.393
Just get it done.

35:27.426 --> 35:28.660
I told you, I'm trying my best.

35:28.694 --> 35:29.828
What do you think,
I'm lying to you?

35:29.861 --> 35:31.763
Oh. That's it.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.499
I got it.
Walt, send Toby.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.401
I'll have Dorie's circuits
burning in no time.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.903
Hey. Quincy's gut flora.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.512
You are one hell of a man,
you know that?

35:46.545 --> 35:48.314
We survive this,

35:48.347 --> 35:50.882
we're gonna make up for lost
honeymoon time tonight, right?

35:50.916 --> 35:51.917
Deal.

36:00.559 --> 36:01.927
(yelps)

36:10.969 --> 36:12.604
(Toby whoops)
Here he comes.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.573
(shrieking)

36:15.641 --> 36:16.608
Electric fence coming up!

36:16.642 --> 36:18.677
Oh, boy!
He's coming right at us.

36:18.710 --> 36:19.945
Oh, oh, aah!

36:21.413 --> 36:22.948
(groans)

36:24.283 --> 36:25.917
How you doing?
Get in.

36:31.923 --> 36:35.794
Dorie, you've answered all of my
questions with great skill.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.429
I'd like to commend you,

36:37.463 --> 36:39.965
but my compliment
would mean nothing, because...

36:39.998 --> 36:41.500
I'm a liar.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.903
Lying is the presentation
of false data.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.639
Correct. Or maybe I don't

36:47.673 --> 36:50.509
think you're correct.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.479
I tell lies, remember?
All the time.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.682
So, do you believe me?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.952
What's wrong, Dorie?

37:00.986 --> 37:02.354
Why no answer?

37:02.388 --> 37:05.257
I am trying
to compute a response.

37:05.291 --> 37:08.260
It's easy.
Do you believe a liar

37:08.294 --> 37:09.961
who tells you that he is a liar?

37:09.995 --> 37:11.062
If you are a liar,

37:11.096 --> 37:14.400
then I can't believe you
when you say you are a liar.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.702
Which would mean you are
the opposite of a liar.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.870
Which would make you truthful,
which would make

37:18.904 --> 37:21.907
your first statement
about being a liar untruthful,

37:21.940 --> 37:23.909
which would make you a liar...
Sly, how goes it?

37:23.942 --> 37:26.345
Dorie's spinning out.
Her RAM is burning

37:26.378 --> 37:28.314
from this puzzle I gave her.
Toby's in the clear.

37:28.347 --> 37:31.317
Except he only has
19 seconds left.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.258
Oh, crap.

37:43.529 --> 37:44.863
Get a whiff of this, baby.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.467
Hello, Dr. Berkstead.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.935
I do not recognize you.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.036
Yeah, it's been a rough day.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.004
Dorie, don't
divert any

37:53.038 --> 37:54.940
processing power away
from the problem you're solving

37:54.973 --> 37:57.309
with Sylvester.
Just cancel all protocols.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.014
Did it shut down?

38:03.048 --> 38:04.015
With a second to spare.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.852
If you guys don't mind,
I'd like to go home now.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.688
Okay, let's get out of here.
Okay, go, go, go.

38:09.721 --> 38:12.090
Dorie, keep working
on that problem

38:12.123 --> 38:14.360
I gave you.
Get back to me on it.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.061
So if the gas
is odorless and colorless,

38:16.094 --> 38:17.729
how are you sure we stopped it?

38:17.763 --> 38:19.731
'Cause we'd be dead by now.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.333
Makes sense.

38:24.035 --> 38:27.406
(laughs)
Oh.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.976
So I guess SafeCorp won't be
too happy with our findings.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.411
WALTER:
Well, something tells me

38:32.444 --> 38:34.346
they'll be bankrupt
before we get paid.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.616
(clears throat loudly)

38:39.485 --> 38:41.019
Hello, team.

38:41.052 --> 38:44.055
Want to report that I,
uh, checked the toxin tank.

38:44.089 --> 38:47.359
It has ceased operation.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.527
All is safe.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.363
You know, Quincy, I find it
ironic that we were saved

38:51.397 --> 38:53.799
by the gut flora of someone
who has no guts.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.569
Attagirl.
Let's go.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.116
CABE:
Good-bye, AI.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.689
Walt, uh, I think you and
I should talk. Okay.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.991
About what?

39:20.025 --> 39:22.494
Well, you know how, uh,
I let a few bumps in the road

39:22.528 --> 39:24.796
at the start of my honeymoon
completely derail me?

39:24.830 --> 39:26.398
I was being
overly dramatic.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.133
That affected the relationship
with the woman I love.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.968
You mean your repeated
intimacy failures.

39:30.001 --> 39:33.038
That's not my point.
I'm just saying

39:33.071 --> 39:35.574
you are being overly dramatic
due to a dumb dream.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.543
Oh.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.110
You've been bumbling around
Florence all day

39:39.144 --> 39:40.779
'cause you think
you've done something wrong,

39:40.812 --> 39:42.047
and you have not.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.682
So the only way
to excise your demons

39:43.715 --> 39:45.116
is to take away
their power.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.419
Its power
is in its secrecy.

39:47.453 --> 39:48.720
So tell her.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.155
Just say to her,

39:50.188 --> 39:52.524
"Hey, I had a crazy dream
and I've been a putz around you

39:52.558 --> 39:54.660
because of it,
and I'm sorry."

39:54.693 --> 39:56.628
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

39:56.662 --> 39:58.163
You'll sleep well.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.398
(sighs)
Okay.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.545
Hey.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.547
You did excellent work today.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.616
Despite my awkward behavior.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.651
Mm. Yes.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.687
You were odd.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.222
Odder than usual.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.625
Okay, I was keeping my distance
today because, uh--

40:26.658 --> 40:28.159
this is uncomfortable--
because, um,

40:28.193 --> 40:31.029
as you tended to me
when I fell,

40:31.062 --> 40:33.765
I was dreaming many things,
uh, one of 'em was

40:33.799 --> 40:35.734
you and me kissing.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.469
We were married.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.039
Oh.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.909
Oh, no, no, no, no. Uh...
thi-this is not a come-on.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.477
I'm in love with Paige.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.513
It's one of the things
that made it so distressing.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.014
We were married and we kissed.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.248
Yeah, Toby assures me

40:50.281 --> 40:53.685
that I was thinking about you
because I heard your voice.

40:53.719 --> 40:56.688
So it was a dream.
Nothing more.

40:56.722 --> 41:00.091
I felt I owed you
an explanation for today.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.259
So, you know...

41:01.292 --> 41:04.596
Um, I appreciate...

41:04.630 --> 41:06.064
your candor.

41:06.097 --> 41:09.000
And... good evening.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.811
I apologize for
ruining our honeymoon.

41:19.845 --> 41:22.548
I already told you
it's not a big deal.

41:22.581 --> 41:25.083
No, I'm not talking
about that. I...

41:25.116 --> 41:28.186
Listen, I-I...
I was just so grumpy

41:28.219 --> 41:30.021
about that crappy room
and the weather,

41:30.055 --> 41:32.591
and not being able
to fix that flat.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.826
I...

41:34.860 --> 41:36.628
I didn't feel
like a man.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.530
I-I know
I was relying

41:38.564 --> 41:41.266
on an outdated
construct, but...

41:41.299 --> 41:43.969
it all affected me,
emotionally.

41:44.002 --> 41:47.706
And, clearly, physically, and...

41:47.739 --> 41:49.140
I'm so sorry.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.309
Okay,
now let me apologize.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.911
What for?

41:52.944 --> 41:55.881
Uh, I objectified you.
Totally ogled you.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.684
When you went up the exhaust
shaft, ready to save the day,

41:58.717 --> 42:00.552
I checked out your tuchus.

42:00.586 --> 42:02.087
It got my motor running, so...

42:02.120 --> 42:04.189
how about we get out of here
and make up for

42:04.222 --> 42:06.157
the honeymoon time
like you promised?

42:06.191 --> 42:08.760
You don't have to
ask me twice.

42:08.794 --> 42:11.162
Wait till I tell you
about Walter's dream.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.265
Hey.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.568
Do you want
to curl up on my couch?

42:16.602 --> 42:19.104
Oh, I could use a cup of hot tea
and an old movie.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.572
Sounds like a plan.

42:20.606 --> 42:22.207
So I saw you
talking to Flo earlier.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.175
You glad I convinced you
to keep her around?

42:24.209 --> 42:26.011
She was invaluable today.
Yes.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.278
I have to admit the reason why

42:27.312 --> 42:29.748
I didn't want her to
come was, uh, childish.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.683
What was that?
It's very silly, actually.

42:31.717 --> 42:33.118
I-I dreamt we were married

42:33.151 --> 42:34.319
and we kissed.
What?!
