ABBY LEE:
<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:03.637 --> 00:07.074
JILL:
<i>Bye‐bye, Pittsburgh.</i>
<i>ALDC L. A. starts today.</i>

00:07.074 --> 00:09.376
ABBY LEE:
<i>Here in Los Angeles‐‐</i>
<i>lots of opportunities.</i>

00:09.376 --> 00:12.145
<i>Maddie is a superstar now.</i>

00:12.145 --> 00:13.146
You and Sia went to
the Grammys together.

00:13.146 --> 00:14.147
Yeah.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.115
We're going

00:15.115 --> 00:16.116
<i>to nationals.</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:17.251
<i>You're not ready.</i>

00:17.251 --> 00:18.719
We're on a losing streak.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.420
JEANETTE:
<i>Our target this week</i>

00:20.420 --> 00:21.488
is beating ALDC.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.992
First place 2015
nationals champion...

00:24.992 --> 00:28.228
"Moving Target,"
Broadway Dance Academy.
(cheering)

00:28.228 --> 00:31.298
ABBY LEE:
<i>What is going on?</i>
<i>There's definitely an error.</i>

00:31.298 --> 00:32.499
We need to walk out.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.801
ABBY LEE (laughing):
Let's go.

00:34.801 --> 00:37.004
You can't move.
ABBY LEE:
<i>This was a (bleep) joke.</i>

00:37.004 --> 00:39.973
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

00:49.650 --> 00:50.951
Let's do this!

00:50.951 --> 00:52.185
JILL:
<i>We're back!</i>

00:52.185 --> 00:53.921
Here we are back in L. A.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.390
<i>Who cares</i>
<i>that nationals was a bust?</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:58.959
There comes a point where
it's not about the winning.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.495
It's about the opportunities,
the experience.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.598
<i>I did not speak to Abby</i>
<i>a lot over the summer,</i>

01:04.598 --> 01:08.969
<i>and I can't wait to get back</i>
<i>on track with Abby.</i>

01:08.969 --> 01:10.437
HOLLY:
We'll meet you inside.
You get a running start.

01:10.437 --> 01:11.805
JILL:
<i>So what's everybody else</i>

01:11.805 --> 01:13.807
been up to?
Maddie and Mackenzie
were busy all summer.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.009
I mean, you know, we had
lots of things going on.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.611
Well, and Maddie's
still not here.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.912
No.
JILL:
Where is she?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.414
Maddie's in New York...
Really?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.249
...filming a movie, which is

01:22.249 --> 01:23.383
so great.
Exciting.

01:23.383 --> 01:24.785
The director is amazing,

01:24.785 --> 01:26.687
'cause he's the one
that did <i>Jurassic World.</i>

01:26.687 --> 01:29.823
JILL:
<i>This is what Abby has groomed</i>

01:29.823 --> 01:32.125
Maddie for‐‐ something bigger,
something better out there.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.528
<i>Now Maddie's not here.</i>

01:34.528 --> 01:37.731
<i>Now is a great opportunity</i>
<i>for the other kids</i>

01:37.731 --> 01:39.633
to step up
and take Maddie's place.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.135
Kendall, for instance,
would be perfect.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.971
JOJO: Do you guys think
Abby's gonna come back? I mean,

01:43.971 --> 01:45.739
she stormed out
at nationals.
KALANI: Yeah.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.842
Um, last time we came to L. A.,
I feel like she was a little

01:48.842 --> 01:51.078
crazy because
the new studio,

01:51.078 --> 01:52.879
and we lost at nationals,
and I just feel like

01:52.879 --> 01:54.381
this new season is
really gonna help her,

01:54.381 --> 01:56.516
because look at
this gorgeous studio. It's done.

01:56.516 --> 01:57.951
Like, I think
she's set,

01:57.951 --> 02:00.120
and I hope
this season's gonna go well.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.556
MELISSA:
So, as you guys know, I took

02:02.556 --> 02:03.957
legal guardianship over Kalani.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.392
Like, you really
signed the papers?
I signed papers.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.893
HOLLY:
Oh! I didn't realize
you did that.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.895
Yeah, I had to. Like, what if
she needs to go to the doctor's,

02:08.895 --> 02:10.297
or something like that.
JESSALYNN:
Yeah.

02:10.297 --> 02:13.300
This is for months,
because, um, Kira's not due

02:13.300 --> 02:15.168
for, like, six weeks away?

02:15.168 --> 02:17.237
<i>With Kira being pregnant,</i>
<i>she's not here,</i>

02:17.237 --> 02:18.572
because she has to take care
of her body.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.474
<i>So, with me, you know,</i>
<i>taking over guardianship</i>

02:20.474 --> 02:22.809
<i>of Kalani, I'm happy to do so.</i>

02:22.809 --> 02:24.478
Hey, guys. Are you
not coming in?

02:24.478 --> 02:25.779
HOLLY:
No, we're gonna come in.

02:25.779 --> 02:26.813
JILL:
Yeah, we'll come in.
All right.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.015
ABBY LEE: <i>After our loss</i>

02:28.015 --> 02:32.019
to BDA or BAD,
whatever they are... (sighs)

02:32.019 --> 02:33.186
<i>I'm disgusted.</i>

02:33.186 --> 02:34.955
<i>That means</i>
<i>I'm going back to where</i>

02:34.955 --> 02:37.124
it all started. We're going back
to the beginning.

02:37.124 --> 02:40.227
<i>It's about technique,</i>
<i>and it's about challenging</i>

02:40.227 --> 02:42.429
<i>these kids to push themselves</i>

02:42.429 --> 02:44.097
every weekend for a competition.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.399
<i>That's what it's all about.</i>

02:45.399 --> 02:47.167
All right, stop!
Let's go!

02:47.167 --> 02:49.002
Come on.
I want everyone to stop.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.303
Stop fooling around.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.471
Yes?

02:51.471 --> 02:53.640
Here we are.
This is the sixth

02:53.640 --> 02:55.175
year in a row.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.743
I have told

02:56.743 --> 02:58.679
you children

02:58.679 --> 03:00.213
you're only as good
as your last performance.

03:00.213 --> 03:03.150
We're fighting, struggling

03:03.150 --> 03:04.951
to stay on top
of our craft.

03:04.951 --> 03:07.020
After nationals,

03:07.020 --> 03:11.958
after that debacle,
never in my life

03:11.958 --> 03:13.493
have I gotten up and
walked out of a competition.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.129
And I felt that you,
as my students,

03:16.129 --> 03:18.665
were being humiliated
on that stage.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.333
Dance

03:20.333 --> 03:21.802
is the priority.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.603
They need

03:23.603 --> 03:24.905
to work harder.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.908
I know you're
back in L. A.,

03:27.908 --> 03:30.377
and I'm contradicting myself,
mothers.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.714
Right now,
this season,

03:33.714 --> 03:35.716
there's a moratorium

03:35.716 --> 03:38.919
on all the extra activities.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.125
Abby, that's...
that doesn't make sense.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.494
The original reason
why we got to L. A.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.529
was to take advantage
of opportunities. Like,

03:49.529 --> 03:52.733
why wouldn't you allow them
to have those opportunities?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.368
I mean, that...
I don't want it to interfere
with their dance training.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.003
So they can't get
an acting job?

03:57.003 --> 03:58.171
They can't go
do anything?

03:58.171 --> 03:59.339
JESSALYNN:
And where is

03:59.339 --> 04:01.007
Maddie right now, then,
with her...? Yeah.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.509
Maddie is shooting a movie.

04:02.509 --> 04:03.643
So, that's okay?

04:03.643 --> 04:06.079
Well...
JILL:
It's inequities.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.448
Why? Why is it okay for
one, and not all of 'em?

04:08.448 --> 04:12.552
I know Maddie's not here.
In that film, she's a dancer.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.054
And that's why she got the part.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.923
From watching her solos from
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.592
That's where it started.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.128
JILL:
<i>I've had people</i>
<i>all summer long calling,</i>

04:21.128 --> 04:22.596
<i>wanting to work</i>
<i>with Kendall, but</i>

04:22.596 --> 04:24.164
I had to turn them down

04:24.164 --> 04:27.234
<i>because of my loyalty to Abby.</i>
<i>That's (bleep).</i>

04:27.234 --> 04:28.935
You know what
you're missing, Abby?

04:28.935 --> 04:32.639
More than anybody in this room,
Kendall and myself

04:32.639 --> 04:34.074
have been loyal

04:34.074 --> 04:35.509
to you.
HOLLY:
Oh, please don't do that.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.178
Well, but that
is the truth.
That's not true.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.713
That is <i>not</i> true.
Okay,
Holly...

04:39.713 --> 04:40.981
HOLLY:
That is not true.

04:40.981 --> 04:41.815
What happened about
that music last year...

04:41.815 --> 04:43.183
I have been more loyal to you

04:43.183 --> 04:44.818
and what you ask...
... has nothing
to do with loyalty.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.986
Do not go there.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.187
Do not go there.
MELISSA:
No, no.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.722
I have been loyal.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.591
My God!
I have done everything
you asked me to do,

04:51.591 --> 04:53.693
and everything you asked me
not to do.

04:53.693 --> 04:54.895
When you said...
ABBY LEE:
In your...

04:54.895 --> 04:56.730
in your eyes; you believe that.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.064
I appreciate that.
No, that's the truth.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.232
It's all on paper.
I appreciate that.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.840
My point is, I'm loyal.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.674
Well, I want more.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.409
KENDALL: <i>It stinks,</i>

05:09.409 --> 05:10.677
<i>because she won't let me go out</i>

05:10.677 --> 05:11.745
and do auditions.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.746
And I just wish

05:12.746 --> 05:14.781
<i>my mom wouldn't cause a scene,</i>

05:14.781 --> 05:16.383
because then it's just gonna
make things worse with Abby.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.985
All right, now, listen.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.654
Pyramid's a little different
this week.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.522
I'm gonna call your name.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.224
Come stand next to me.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.592
Nia.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.194
Get your headshot, honey.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.898
ABBY LEE: <i>Being humiliated</i>
<i>on that stage...</i>

05:31.898 --> 05:34.835
hopefully, that made
everybody realize

05:34.835 --> 05:38.038
<i>they need</i>
<i>to set themselves apart.</i>

05:38.038 --> 05:40.307
They need to be ten points above

05:40.307 --> 05:41.942
whoever their competition is.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.644
<i>And if they're not gonna</i>
<i>do that, let's just...</i>

05:44.644 --> 05:46.379
throw the towel in,

05:46.379 --> 05:47.547
be done,

05:47.547 --> 05:48.782
and I'll go on my way.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.218
So turn around
and look in that mirror.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.187
You're all at the bottom
of the pyramid,

05:54.187 --> 05:55.355
since you lost.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.057
You lose again...

05:57.057 --> 05:58.425
Not good.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.694
Turn around.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.663
We don't have Maddie.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.232
That scares me, but...

06:05.232 --> 06:07.267
I have the next best thing.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.938
(girls exclaiming happily)

06:13.073 --> 06:15.008
Brynn!
Hello. Hey.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.210
ABBY LEE:
<i>Last year, when Brynn was here,</i>

06:17.210 --> 06:18.912
<i>she really stood out to me.</i>

06:18.912 --> 06:20.747
Can you just push
right off that‐‐

06:20.747 --> 06:23.383
an inside leg turn‐‐
or is it the wrong way?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.784
Good.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.286
<i>While Maddie's away,</i>

06:26.286 --> 06:27.988
<i>I need someone</i>
<i>to stand in for her.</i>

06:27.988 --> 06:30.757
<i>Somebody that is going</i>
<i>to be a consistent winner.</i>

06:30.757 --> 06:33.126
<i>That's why</i>
<i>I'm bringing in Brynn.</i>

06:33.126 --> 06:34.661
<i>If she can prove</i>
<i>that she's a winner,</i>

06:34.661 --> 06:36.129
then Brynn can stay
as long as she wants.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.831
I think you were here
before and you...

06:37.831 --> 06:39.099
and you left.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.600
My life is
totally different

06:40.600 --> 06:41.935
and I am ready
to focus on her.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.270
She wants to be here,

06:43.270 --> 06:46.439
she's gonna work
her butt off to‐to be

06:46.439 --> 06:47.440
your star dancer.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.242
ABBY LEE:
Well, I'm gonna be

06:49.242 --> 06:50.443
tough, tough, tough
love on this kid,

06:50.443 --> 06:52.012
'cause I want to see

06:52.012 --> 06:53.713
if she has what
it really takes

06:53.713 --> 06:56.082
to dance with these girls,
to be part of this team.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.120
Abby loves shiny new toys.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.187
She parades

07:01.187 --> 07:02.722
<i>Brynn in here and says,</i>

07:02.722 --> 07:04.190
"This is the new Maddie."

07:04.190 --> 07:06.226
<i>It's a slap in the face</i>
<i>to Kendall.</i>

07:06.226 --> 07:07.627
<i>What is going on here?</i>

07:07.627 --> 07:11.031
Okay. So this week,
we're going to Sheer Talent

07:11.031 --> 07:12.465
in Glendale, California.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.701
Maddie is supposed
to be here Saturday,

07:14.701 --> 07:17.237
but she is not dancing.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.972
So, Brynn, you're doing a solo.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.510
It's entitled "Coronation."

07:23.510 --> 07:27.013
KENDALL:
<i>It kind of bugs me</i>
<i>that Brynn just waltzes in</i>

07:27.013 --> 07:29.349
<i>and she gets a solo</i>
<i>handed to her.</i>

07:29.349 --> 07:32.118
I mean, we've been here
for six whole years

07:32.118 --> 07:35.789
and she's been here for ten
minutes and already got a solo.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.090
ABBY LEE:
The group routine...

07:39.893 --> 07:41.094
...is an idea
taken from an old movie,

07:41.094 --> 07:43.663
<i>The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.</i>

07:43.663 --> 07:45.465
One of you
is actually going to be

07:45.465 --> 07:47.167
in a bubble.
(gasps)

07:47.167 --> 07:50.070
I want to be
in a bubble!
I want to be in a bubble!

07:50.070 --> 07:54.074
So... it's my dad's wedding
this Saturday,

07:54.074 --> 07:56.076
so I won't be able
to come to competition,

07:56.076 --> 07:58.645
but I'm going to be
at the rehearsals.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.779
I leave Friday.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.348
Well, what good are you

08:05.752 --> 08:07.721

I can't talk to you this way.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.722

this competition,

08:12.692 --> 08:14.327

they hold the power.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.654
"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble."

08:41.654 --> 08:44.524

08:44.524 --> 08:47.794

08:47.794 --> 08:50.797
they can't go outside, they're
allergic to other people,

08:50.797 --> 08:54.100
and if they catch these germs,
they can die.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.136

08:56.136 --> 08:57.604

how many weeks...?

08:57.604 --> 08:59.139
Were you here two weeks with us?

08:59.139 --> 09:00.140
Just two. Yeah.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.207
Two weeks.
Just two.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.475
Did she do a solo then?

09:02.475 --> 09:03.610
ASHLEE:
<i>Yep, she did one solo.</i>

09:03.610 --> 09:04.744
JILL:
<i>I forget, did she win?</i>

09:04.744 --> 09:07.180
No, she came second to Maddie.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.849
Even though Brynn didn't
beat Maddie last time,

09:09.849 --> 09:12.052
I know that Maddie was
intimidated by Brynn.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.020
I'm nervous because...
(laughing)

09:14.020 --> 09:15.822
she has amazing
technique.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.324
Got to keep her
on her toes, right?

09:18.324 --> 09:20.660
Now we're back,
Brynn has more experience,

09:20.660 --> 09:22.662
and I think she's ready
to show everybody

09:22.662 --> 09:24.297
the dancer that she really is.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.566
Well, you know that we did
<i>Dancing with the Stars</i>

09:26.566 --> 09:28.902
with Maddie, and Brynn
adores Maddie, but...

09:28.902 --> 09:31.271
Also, uh, so does...
Maddie adores Brynn.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.640
But she did make
the comment, she was like,

09:33.640 --> 09:36.743
"Mom, Melissa kept saying that
we were just backup dancers."

09:36.743 --> 09:38.411
<i>I</i> said that?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.746
ASHLEE:
Yes.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.214
Whatever.
ASHLEE: Several times.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.583
<i>Brynn said, "Mom, Melissa</i>
<i>came in the dressing room</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:45.618
"and was like, 'Maddie's
costume is different, right?

09:45.618 --> 09:47.287
MELISSA: Yes.
She's different, 'cause these
girls are just backup dancers.'"

09:47.287 --> 09:49.189
Right.
So it just was crappy
that we showed up

09:49.189 --> 09:51.191
and it was like,
"Backup dancer, backup dancer.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.026
Okay.
You're a backup dancer,
you're a backup dancer."

09:53.026 --> 09:55.829
I'm not fighting with people
anymore, so...

09:55.829 --> 09:58.698
ASHLEE: <i>Maddie's stardom has</i>
<i>really gone to Melissa's head.</i>

09:58.698 --> 10:00.033
She's just a coward.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.035
Anybody that can't
own up to something

10:02.035 --> 10:03.837
<i>that they said or did</i>

10:03.837 --> 10:05.171

ventilation in there.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.975
Well, I‐I will try hard not to.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.610
But I need you
to go in there

16:17.610 --> 16:19.278

everybody knows and loves.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.279
Okay.
Okay?

16:20.279 --> 16:21.280
Okay.
All right.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.715
Let's go.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.451
I know Kendall doesn't like
to see me argue with Abby,

16:25.451 --> 16:27.854
<i>but it's heartbreaking for me</i>

16:27.854 --> 16:30.189
to sit back and watch Kendall
get passed by for Brynn.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.758
<i>Kendall has worked too hard</i>
<i>to be Abby's number two,</i>

16:32.758 --> 16:34.894

was the first day back,

16:41.334 --> 16:45.204
<i>you two needed to leave just</i>
<i>to, like... to take a break.</i>

16:55.548 --> 16:56.449
What's happening?

16:56.449 --> 16:57.617
Give me a rundown.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.819
MADDIE: <i>I filmed</i>
<i>three or four scenes,</i>

16:59.819 --> 17:02.054

17:02.054 --> 17:04.924

her butt off, but she loves it.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.807
<i>Okay, that whole thing</i>
<i>that happened yesterday,</i>

17:21.807 --> 17:23.075
that was not me
yelling at you.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.076
That was your mother

17:24.076 --> 17:25.845
<i>screaming about something</i>

17:25.845 --> 17:28.080
and then you getting upset.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.349
I look at you and think
that you don't work hard enough,

17:30.349 --> 17:31.884
and I think your mother
looks at you

17:31.884 --> 17:33.452
and looks at the hour
you wake up

17:33.452 --> 17:35.888
and the hour you go to sleep
and sees what you're doing

17:35.888 --> 17:38.090
and thinks, "Oh, my God,
this kid is working so hard."

17:38.090 --> 17:40.259
But I'm not seeing it.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.328
<i>You got to figure it out.</i>

17:42.328 --> 17:46.065

17:46.065 --> 17:47.333

17:47.333 --> 17:48.668
But I don't want
to upset Kendall,

17:48.668 --> 17:50.403
and then, you know,
she's mad at me,

17:50.403 --> 17:51.637
so she goes straight to Kendall.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.372
JESSALYNN:
<i>She knows how to get to you.</i>

17:53.372 --> 17:54.640

17:54.640 --> 17:56.042
everything we could've
been doing all summer,

17:56.042 --> 17:57.243

17:57.243 --> 17:59.111

pass me up and pass me by.

HOLLY: Maddie, now that
you've done this, do you‐‐

24:39.578 --> 24:40.913
would you want to do more?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.948
Now you've done this,
you starred in this film,

24:42.948 --> 24:44.416
could you see yourself
doing more of these?

24:44.416 --> 24:45.451
Mm‐hmm.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.819
MADDIE:
I have so much fun,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.187

24:48.187 --> 24:50.155
Getting to work with, like,
really experienced

24:50.155 --> 24:51.657

24:51.657 --> 24:52.958
really, really cool.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.093

24:54.093 --> 24:55.394
to be back with my team,

24:55.394 --> 24:56.929

24:56.929 --> 24:58.130
<i>that I'm not competing.</i>

24:58.130 --> 24:59.264

24:59.264 --> 25:01.000
that Abby brought Brynn in,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.036
but it does make sense,
because I haven't been here,

25:04.036 --> 25:05.337

25:05.337 --> 25:07.106
<i>these past few weeks.</i>

<i>Your mom and I both know</i>

25:10.909 --> 25:12.978

There's no doubt about it.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.314
Sometimes it can be
a little bit intimidating

25:15.314 --> 25:18.017
going against Abby,
so I'm gonna send

25:18.017 --> 25:19.385

you danced,

25:26.925 --> 25:29.294

against Maddie, right?

25:29.294 --> 25:30.929
You were like
this frightened little puppy.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.364
And that's not Brynn.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.565
That's not you.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.334
I don't think that,
coming in here,

25:35.334 --> 25:36.502

25:36.502 --> 25:38.437
a fierce competitor,
and she is.

25:38.437 --> 25:39.605
She's not scared.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.373

37:47.499 --> 37:49.134
Next, we have "teen group."

37:51.002 --> 37:54.105
HOLLY: <i>BDA beat us</i>
<i>at nationals last year,</i>

37:54.105 --> 37:55.940
and we have to redeem ourselves.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.210
So, second place
in teen group...

38:00.545 --> 38:03.748
... goes to act number 29,
"The Waiting Room."

38:03.748 --> 38:05.950
Are you kidding me?
(cheering, whooping)

38:08.186 --> 38:10.622
ERIKSON:
First place for teen group...

38:12.857 --> 38:14.192
..."The Girl
in the Plastic Bubble."

38:14.192 --> 38:16.661
(whooping, cheering, applause)

38:16.661 --> 38:20.298
KENDALL: <i>Winning the competition</i>
<i>against BDA</i>

38:20.298 --> 38:23.334
is kind of like a payback,
so it feels really good,

38:23.334 --> 38:25.336
and I'm just happy that we won
because we're probably gonna

38:25.336 --> 38:27.405
have a really good
week next week.

38:27.405 --> 38:30.642
ABBY LEE: <i>Congratulations</i>
<i>on a wonderful victory.</i>

38:30.642 --> 38:33.178
Kendall, this beautiful girl
in this beautiful dress

38:33.178 --> 38:35.413
is so much prettier
to look at

38:35.413 --> 38:37.415
than the little girl crying
and running out of the studio

38:37.415 --> 38:38.550
saying, "I quit,
I quit, I'm finished."

38:38.550 --> 38:39.617
We love her.

38:39.617 --> 38:41.619
ABBY LEE:
You agree? Yeah?

38:41.619 --> 38:44.055
No more of that, okay?

38:44.055 --> 38:45.290
All right.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.758
ABBY LEE: <i>I'm not trying</i>
<i>to "get on" Kendall.</i>

38:46.758 --> 38:49.694
<i>I don't even think</i>
<i>I'm hard on Kendall at all.</i>

38:49.694 --> 38:51.095
Kendall is a beautiful child.

38:51.095 --> 38:52.530
<i>And I think</i>
<i>she could be a star.</i>

38:52.530 --> 38:54.199
Let's talk about the future,

38:54.199 --> 38:56.668
'cause right now, you're only as
good as your last performance.

38:56.668 --> 39:00.338
You have to go onward
and upward from here.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.340
So your height,
you're growing...

39:02.340 --> 39:04.342
You need...

39:04.342 --> 39:08.279
your talent, your stamina,
your energy, your flexibility

39:08.279 --> 39:09.447
to keep up with that.

39:09.447 --> 39:10.982
All of you.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.383
And it's tough, it stinks.

39:12.383 --> 39:14.619
ABBY LEE: <i>Maddie is</i>
<i>the star she is</i>

39:14.619 --> 39:18.590
because she focused
on what I told her was wrong.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.492
When she had a mistake,

39:21.492 --> 39:23.828
<i>she worked on it.</i>

39:23.828 --> 39:26.097
She is now a global phenomenon.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.933
<i>And if these other girls</i>
<i>figured it out,</i>

39:28.933 --> 39:32.237
that there's nothing wrong
with a little more hard work,

39:32.237 --> 39:33.838
they would be famous, too.

39:33.838 --> 39:36.507
Tomorrow, I'm leaving for
New York for two weeks.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.409
Aw...
Honey...

39:38.409 --> 39:41.112
We've been doing this
for so long,

39:41.112 --> 39:44.515
and we appreciate it,
and we love...

39:44.515 --> 39:47.518
we love being with each other,
because I love these ladies

39:47.518 --> 39:49.988
and these kids
like they're mine.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.924
And it's hard because I think
things are changing for us.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.359
You know?

39:54.359 --> 39:56.394
(voice breaking):
Because I love to see
my daughter on stage.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.062
It's just hard
for me today.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.430
I'm sorry, but don't
say, "Don't cry,"

39:59.430 --> 40:01.766
because it's what I do,

40:01.766 --> 40:04.402
it's what... why I exist
for my kids.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.105
I love to see my...
Yeah, but just imagine sitting
in a movie theater.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.640
I know, I can't wait.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.541
But I miss
her so much.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.010
This is just the beginning.
Remember.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.412
I'm saving my tears
for my pillow.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.848
I have to save them,
put them in a box‐‐ ah.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.016
JILL: Abby,
what's wrong?

40:18.016 --> 40:19.484
ABBY LEE:
Ugh, lots.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.387
Yep.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.423
I just feel like...

40:27.325 --> 40:31.095
I just feel like I have shackles
on my ankles, dragging me down.

40:31.095 --> 40:35.833
JILL: <i>Did she just say she has</i>
<i>shackles weighing her down?</i>

40:35.833 --> 40:37.168
She's lost it.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.938
When you can control
your own destiny

40:39.938 --> 40:41.539
and you make mistakes,
and you screw up,

40:41.539 --> 40:44.676
or you do something wrong, you
pay the consequences, that's it.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.149
ABBY LEE:
<i>This season on</i> Dance Moms...

40:53.284 --> 40:56.955
ABBY LEE: <i>The world thinks that</i>
<i>I struck gold with this group.</i>

40:56.955 --> 40:59.257
<i>I disagree.</i>

40:59.257 --> 41:03.895
<i>Do you have any more passion</i>
<i>or any more desire?</i>

41:03.895 --> 41:06.831
<i>There's a lot further</i>
<i>for you to go, all of you.</i>

41:08.333 --> 41:10.301
(cheering, applause,
whistling)

41:12.036 --> 41:14.739
It's time to get a little
hungrier for that win.

41:14.739 --> 41:18.476
<i>When you lose, that's like</i>
<i>someone taking a knife</i>

41:18.476 --> 41:19.777
and just, like...
(imitates flesh ripping)

41:19.777 --> 41:21.179
in my chest.

41:21.179 --> 41:24.048
<i>So I have looked at minis</i>
<i>all over the country.</i>

41:25.083 --> 41:25.950
JILL: Are you
kidding me?

41:25.950 --> 41:27.852
You never trained that kid.

41:27.852 --> 41:30.621
You never taught her
a (bleep) damn thing.

41:30.621 --> 41:31.889
JILL:
Oh, is she crying?

41:31.889 --> 41:33.124
ASHLEE:
What is wrong with you?

41:33.124 --> 41:34.292
I'm not playing the game.
If other people

41:34.292 --> 41:35.460
don't have to play
the game, I'm not.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.061
Bull! You lied!

41:37.061 --> 41:39.764
JILL: She needs to
shut her (bleep) mouth!

41:39.764 --> 41:41.366
MELISSA:
I'm gonna punch her in the face.

41:41.366 --> 41:44.369
You're my princess,
and you shine, okay?

41:44.369 --> 41:48.106
MELISSA:
<i>I just want you to care about</i>
<i>her like you used to, Abby.</i>

41:48.106 --> 41:51.042
REPORTER: Abby Lee Miller,
in serious legal drama,

41:51.042 --> 41:52.944
faces up to five years in jail.

41:52.944 --> 41:56.381
HOLLY: <i>Debbie Allen wanted</i>
<i>to work with our girls.</i>

41:56.381 --> 42:00.284
So if Abby's not prepared,
there is a studio that wants us.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.320
Success is a journey.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.289
<i>It is not a single destination.</i>

42:05.289 --> 42:07.325
This may have to fold
because she can't sustain it.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.861
Walk away. Say it, put your
money where your mouth is.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.262
<i>Walk away.</i>

42:11.262 --> 42:12.630
ABBY LEE:
<i>I'm hysterical.</i>

42:12.630 --> 42:15.166
My hair's in rollers,
I don't have a bra on,

42:15.166 --> 42:17.368
<i>and I have a huge</i>
<i>legal issue going on.</i>

42:17.368 --> 42:19.537
MELISSA: <i>She doesn't want</i>
<i>to mess with me right now.</i>

42:19.537 --> 42:20.705
I know so much stuff.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.764
I'm finished.
