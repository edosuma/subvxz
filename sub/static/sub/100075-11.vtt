11:41.734 --> 11:44.704
What makes Haitian castor oil
so unique

11:44.704 --> 11:47.640
is a composition
that only the oil has,

11:47.640 --> 11:49.642
which is called
ricinoleic acid.

than regular castor oil?

So, the way castor oil
is normally processed,

12:04.724 --> 12:06.926
what manufacturers do is,
they use hexene,

the castor oil in bulk,

So, the reason that we feel that
we're gonna get to $2 million

13:25.004 --> 13:26.272
is that we just secured
a contract

13:26.272 --> 13:29.275

lots of time making sure
