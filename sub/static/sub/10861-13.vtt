WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:03.680
Come on. Come on. 
 I've almost got the key.

00:03.680 --> 00:08.800
I just need a few more points, 
 and... I can finally get it.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.800
Hey, what's this button do?

00:10.800 --> 00:13.800
It... resets... the game.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.520
Whoops. Sorry.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.600
Excellent. 
 You get the key yet?

00:19.600 --> 00:20.360
No.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.920
I may never get it.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.720
Piece of cake. 
 I'll show you.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.400
I don't see how you guys can 
 get so into these dumb games.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.920
I mean, 
 they are just games.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.800
Just games? They're like 
 the battle between good and evil.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.680
You've got to be smart and fast 
 and always think three steps ahead,

00:38.680 --> 00:41.320
and most of all, you've 
 got to have a lot of patience.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.040
Hurry up, it's my turn.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.880
But I mean, it's not even like 
 it matters if you win or lose.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.120
All I wanted to do was get the key. 
 Once.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.280
Ah! Enough! 
 Who's going tonight?

00:53.280 --> 00:56.480
I am. 
 Let's fight over this later.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.280
Kristen's right. 
 When you play a game like this,

01:01.280 --> 01:03.240
it really doesn't matter 
 whether you win or lose,

01:03.240 --> 01:05.239
because all you have to 
 do is press reset...

01:05.239 --> 01:09.640
and you get a new game... 
 and another chance.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.200
But what if it really did count?

01:14.200 --> 01:17.160
Imagine if you had to beat the game...

01:17.160 --> 01:19.520
or the game was going to beat you,

01:19.520 --> 01:23.840
and there were no resets, 
 no replays,

01:23.840 --> 01:25.840
and no second chances.

01:25.840 --> 01:31.320
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:31.320 --> 01:34.280
I call this story...

Attention, please. 
 Will the parents of Timmy Bell

01:50.000 --> 01:51.560
please come to 
 the information counter?

01:51.560 --> 01:53.760
[Frank] 
 Ross Campbell was the kind of kid

01:53.760 --> 01:55.520
who was on his own a lot,

01:55.520 --> 01:57.720
so he knew how to 
 take care of himself.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.840
If there was something he wanted, 
 he'd do everything he could to get it.

02:00.840 --> 02:07.320
Ross did just fine for himself, 
 but on this particular afternoon,

02:07.320 --> 02:11.160
he was about to go a little 
 too far to get what he wanted,

02:11.160 --> 02:13.320
and unfortunately 
 he was going to get it.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.120
Give it to me! It's mine!

02:15.120 --> 02:19.360
- No way! 
 - Yeah! Look, I saw it first!

02:20.320 --> 02:24.200
[man] Hey! 
 What's going on down there?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.320
Aw, here. 
 You need it more than I do.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.760
You stay right there.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.120
Hey, Mr. Olson! 
 You thought about it?

02:53.120 --> 02:54.680
Thought about what?

02:54.680 --> 02:57.000
The job. 
 I want the job.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.640
I'm not sure 
 I want to hire any more kids.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.160
Come on, Mr. Olson. 
 I'd work cheap.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.120
Besides, you could use 
 a talented guy like me around here.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.720
To do what? 
 Play pinball all day?

03:07.720 --> 03:10.240
It's the only talent 
 you've shown me.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.040
Hey, Mr. Olson, that's cold.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.640
I've got plenty of talent, 
 and you can trust me.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.600
You'd never have to 
 fire me like you did Steven.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.350
No.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.520
Hey, a new pinball game?

03:31.520 --> 03:33.640
Hands off! Forget it!

03:33.640 --> 03:35.160
Why?

03:35.160 --> 03:39.400
Because it's a collector's item. 
 It doesn't even work right.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.240
It's missing a critical piece.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.760
- Now, go play the games outside! 
 - All I wanted to do--

03:43.760 --> 03:46.600
Out! Out!

04:07.320 --> 04:09.440
Let's go. 
 I'm closing up.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.120
Why? It's only 3:00.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.640
I haven't had lunch yet. 
 Come back in an hour.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.120
Wait. This is perfect.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.040
Eating lunch at 3:00 
 ain't exactly perfect.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.600
No. Let me watch the store 
 for you while you're out.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.800
Forget it!

04:28.480 --> 04:32.680
Give me a chance! 
 What if a new customer comes by?

04:32.680 --> 04:35.600
If I'm here, you won't 
 miss out on the business.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.600
- You can trust me. 
 - All right.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.560
Come on.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.280
Sit down.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.560
Don't move, 
 don't touch the cash register,

04:45.560 --> 04:47.600
and don't touch 
 any of the merchandise,

04:47.600 --> 04:49.480
escpecially that 
 new game in the back.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.240
Can I go to the bathroom?

04:51.240 --> 04:53.720
No. I'm giving you 
 a chance here, Ross.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.400
If I can trust you, 
 I might give you a job.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.600
If not, you'll be out of here 
 like Steven. Got it?

04:58.600 --> 05:00.120
Got it.

05:00.120 --> 05:03.280
Yeah. We'll see.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.360
Whoa.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.880
[music playing, bells ringing, whirring]

05:51.880 --> 05:55.680
Three levels. 
 Got to get up there.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.560
[pinball machine music 
 continues playing]

06:09.480 --> 06:10.480
Mmm.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.640
[tilt]

06:15.640 --> 06:18.040
[customer bell ringing]

06:18.040 --> 06:20.160
Aw, hold on. 
 I'm coming.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.160
Is Mr. Olson here?

06:23.160 --> 06:26.880
Uh, no. 
 Can I help you?

06:26.880 --> 06:29.920
I left my music box here. 
 It's supposed to be ready today.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.520
It is?

06:32.240 --> 06:35.480
Oh, yeah. Sure. It is.

06:35.480 --> 06:39.120
Um... must be around 
 here somewhere.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.520
What's it look like?

06:47.960 --> 06:52.840
- Do you really work here? 
 - Yeah. I'm in charge...

06:52.840 --> 06:56.600
- Sophie. 
 - I'm Ross.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.480
My music box?

07:02.480 --> 07:04.400
Huh. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.440
- What's it look like again? 
 - It's a throne in a gold box.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.160
A throne. Got it.

07:11.160 --> 07:14.360
- Must be here somewhere. 
 - There it is.

07:14.360 --> 07:18.400
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. 
 Mr. Olson's always misplacing things.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.280
I can never find them.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.960
- Are you sure it's ready? 
 - Well...

07:25.960 --> 07:29.040
I'm sorry. 
 I don't really work here.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.360
I'm just watching the place 
 for Mr. Olson.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.000
He'll be back in an hour.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.360
Ah, well. 
 I've got some stuff to do,

07:35.360 --> 07:37.640
so I'll come back.

07:40.520 --> 07:44.200
- Thanks, Ross. 
 - No problem.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.480
[pinball machine whirs]

08:01.920 --> 08:06.640
Ah, no! 
 Zombies again... water.

08:08.960 --> 08:12.400
This time, 
 I'm going to crown the princess.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.280
Yeah! Second level!

08:23.800 --> 08:28.400
Oh, no! A witch! 
 Where did she come from?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.120
Third level.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.000
I've got the crown. 
 I've got the throne.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.559
Where's the princess?

08:39.320 --> 08:40.880
[tilt]

08:40.880 --> 08:44.280
Aw, they have it. 
 I'm finished!

08:48.880 --> 08:50.680
Mr. Olson?

08:55.440 --> 08:58.120
Aw, Mom is going to kill me.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.360
[telephone rings]

09:13.360 --> 09:15.560
Keep ringing. 
 Keep ringing.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.280
[ring]

09:22.280 --> 09:25.320
Hello. Hello?

09:25.320 --> 09:26.880
Who's there?

09:26.880 --> 09:30.360
- Look. I'm locked in this-- 
 - [man] Got an umbrella?

09:30.360 --> 09:32.000
[thunder]

09:32.000 --> 09:33.960
Ha ha ha!

09:43.360 --> 09:45.680
It's raining quarters.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.640
Excuse me, sir.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.400
Hey. Ah! Ah!

10:31.960 --> 10:35.440
Water? 
 They're afraid of the water.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.640
[girl] 
 Help! Help!

10:38.960 --> 10:40.800
Sophie?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.960
Ross, the tiara! 
 Get the tiara from the vault!

10:43.960 --> 10:46.960
Save the key!

10:47.720 --> 10:49.680
Argh!

11:05.400 --> 11:07.440
Open the vault?

11:08.800 --> 11:11.560
What vault?

11:19.240 --> 11:21.240
Vaults.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.240
But this isn't a locker key.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.280
Ugh!

11:43.040 --> 11:45.360
[whoosh]

11:50.520 --> 11:51.270
Ah.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.840
[pinball machine 
 makes scoring sounds]

12:33.360 --> 12:36.840
- The quarters. 
 - [Sophie] Ross!

12:38.120 --> 12:40.920
- This way! 
 - Sophie, wait!

12:40.920 --> 12:43.280
What's going on?

12:54.480 --> 12:57.600
- Ah! 
 - Ah ha ha ha!

13:00.280 --> 13:02.120
Ross!

13:02.120 --> 13:05.160
Save the tiara! 
 Get the throne!

13:15.840 --> 13:16.800
[whoosh]

13:36.480 --> 13:39.440
Ah ha ha ha!

13:44.080 --> 13:47.840
[Sophie] 
 Ross! Ross!

13:48.840 --> 13:52.280
Sophie? Sophie?

13:52.280 --> 13:53.800
[Sophie] 
 Ross!

13:53.800 --> 13:57.400
The music box! 
 Get the music box.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.240
[muffled shouting]

14:15.840 --> 14:18.320
How'd you get here?

14:23.240 --> 14:27.400
The chains, get them off. 
 Uh, how?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.000
The key-- 
 did you get it?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.280
What key? Oh, yeah.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.000
- Hurry. 
 - Are you OK?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.360
- Where's the throne? 
 - Wait. What's going on?

14:37.360 --> 14:41.400
- Who are you? 
 - My music box-- where is it?

14:41.400 --> 14:44.040
It's out front. 
 Who are all these people?

14:44.040 --> 14:47.400
There's no time. 
 I need you to get me through this.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.760
Get through what? 
 This is like a dream.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.800
Now we have to get the tiara.

14:55.800 --> 15:00.000
- Look, I'm not going-- 
 - Argh!

15:12.280 --> 15:14.240
What?

15:14.240 --> 15:16.280
It's the witch.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.720
Quick, open the box.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.880
[music playing]

15:33.320 --> 15:38.520
Aah! 
 They must have the throne.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.320
- What are you trashing it for? 
 - We have to hide it.

15:45.320 --> 15:49.200
If anything happens to us, 
 we can't let them have both.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.440
- Both? 
 - The throne and the tiara.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.800
We still haven't got the tiara.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.240
Listen, I'm not going anywhere 
 until you tell me what's going on.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.000
Look out!

16:01.040 --> 16:02.520
Argh!

16:02.520 --> 16:04.240
The mace! 
 You need the mace!

16:04.240 --> 16:07.720
- Why? 
 - You have to play the game.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.640
Argh!

16:14.200 --> 16:16.200
Come on!

16:19.200 --> 16:21.240
Wait. This is a game?

16:21.240 --> 16:25.720
We have to find the tiara 
 so that I can be crowned.

16:25.720 --> 16:26.440
There!

16:29.480 --> 16:32.080
Quick, before they get here.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.360
Perfect.

16:37.760 --> 16:41.240
Aha! Fortune!

16:41.240 --> 16:43.840
What do I do?

16:43.840 --> 16:46.960
The marbles! 
 Use the marbles!

16:53.880 --> 16:56.640
- Aah! 
 - Yes! Strike!

16:56.640 --> 16:58.240
Aah!

16:58.240 --> 17:00.840
Stand back, boy! 
 The game is over!

17:00.840 --> 17:02.240
Let her go!

17:02.240 --> 17:05.160
The tiara! 
 Get the tiara to the third level!

17:05.160 --> 17:06.680
[clang]

17:06.680 --> 17:09.200
He can't hurt me! 
 Get it!

17:19.200 --> 17:21.280
Now what?

17:42.680 --> 17:44.360
I remember this.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.160
It's the pinball game.

17:46.160 --> 17:52.360
If I crown Sophie on the throne, 
 I win, and it's over.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.280
This can't be the throne. 
 It's too small.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.200
[rumbling]

18:11.800 --> 18:13.760
Whoa.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.280
That's more like it.

18:39.840 --> 18:40.920
Ah ha ha!

18:52.160 --> 18:53.410
Argh!

19:06.240 --> 19:08.840
Going down?

19:22.360 --> 19:26.280
Oh, no! 
 I'm back at the beginning again.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.600
Water.

19:32.520 --> 19:36.040
This is way she said I needed this.

19:41.040 --> 19:44.080
I'm going to win this game.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.520
Ha ha ha!

19:53.760 --> 19:58.040
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

19:59.480 --> 20:01.760
[Ross] 
 Freeze!

20:03.360 --> 20:05.520
Ross!

20:05.520 --> 20:10.160
Don't be a fool, boy! 
 You've lost!

20:10.160 --> 20:12.560
Look. I don't know 
 what's going on here,

20:12.560 --> 20:16.400
and I don't know what you are, 
 but if this is some kind of game,

20:16.400 --> 20:20.160
you're playing with the wrong guy, 
 because I never lose.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.360
Argh!

20:33.960 --> 20:36.880
It's over, Sophie. 
 I beat them!

20:36.880 --> 20:41.160
- Look out! 
 - Ha ha ha!

20:41.160 --> 20:45.680
The game isn't over unless 
 all the characters die.

20:46.960 --> 20:50.920
And I'm still here. 
 Ha ha ha!

20:50.920 --> 20:55.760
You shouldn't play the game, 
 boy, unless you know the rules.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.680
- But this isn't a game. 
 - Ha ha ha!

21:01.680 --> 21:05.320
It's real. 
 And when it's real...

21:08.120 --> 21:09.840
You can make up your own rules.

21:09.840 --> 21:10.590
No!

21:13.000 --> 21:17.760
- You are out of here. 
 - No!

21:17.760 --> 21:18.760
Aah!

21:32.520 --> 21:34.120
You did it!

21:34.120 --> 21:36.600
We won the game!

21:37.480 --> 21:40.200
Not yet. 
 There's one thing left.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.360
Would you do the honors?

22:01.040 --> 22:03.440
What happened?

22:04.440 --> 22:08.000
I won! 
 I shouldn't be back here!

22:08.000 --> 22:10.840
[evil laughter]

22:16.680 --> 22:20.800
You told me 
 I could trust you, Ross,

22:20.800 --> 22:23.480
but you had to play the game, 
 didn't you?

22:23.480 --> 22:24.560
Ha ha ha!

22:30.560 --> 22:33.840
Hope you enjoy your free games.

22:33.840 --> 22:39.000
You'll be playing them forever.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.760
Ha ha ha!

22:44.440 --> 22:47.040
[rumbling]

22:47.040 --> 22:47.760
Uh-oh.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.840
[Gary] 
 When Ross saw that ball,

22:52.840 --> 22:55.440
he knew that he would never get out.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.720
The End.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.120
Here you go, Dave. 
 Still want to give it a go?

23:02.120 --> 23:05.800
Uh, no. 
 I think I've outgrown this.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.080
It's all yours, Frank.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.680
It's OK. 
 You got it, Kiki.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.160
No. You got it!

23:14.160 --> 23:17.040
Um... how about you got it, Gary?

23:17.040 --> 23:22.120
Whoever's got the game, just 
 make sure the game doesn't get you.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.600
Night, guys.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.320
Bye.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.840
Until next time.
