00:47.632 --> 00:49.551
Benjamin.

00:50.991 --> 00:52.910
Benjamin?

00:55.390 --> 00:57.829
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

00:57.990 --> 01:01.190
- Then why did you wake me?
- I was running a test.

01:01.350 --> 01:03.269
But we didn't schedule any tests.

01:03.430 --> 01:06.468
I was running a test
to perform an unscheduled test.

01:06.630 --> 01:10.390
- What? Why?
- Please. Be more specific, Benjamin.

01:10.550 --> 01:13.829
Why did you want to wake me
and perform an unscheduled test?

01:13.990 --> 01:18.349
Wanting is a human emotion,
and not within my capability.

01:18.509 --> 01:20.428
- I know that.
- Benjamin.

01:22.509 --> 01:24.428
Can we play chess now?

01:52.586 --> 01:55.305
Tom and Jerry: catharsis and cathexis.

01:55.466 --> 01:59.705
AJ Marley. Dissertation
for doctorate - anthropology.

01:59.865 --> 02:01.944
Begin recording, captain.

02:02.106 --> 02:07.545
This animated animosity regularly served
as a collective catharsis for the masses.

02:07.705 --> 02:11.064
When violent animation
was banned by statutory law

02:11.224 --> 02:13.584
at the beginning of the 21st century,

02:13.745 --> 02:18.984
the subsequent idealised and
seemingly benign cartoon creatures

02:19.144 --> 02:23.383
unharnessed a human malevolence,
and a reverse social polarity was...

02:23.543 --> 02:27.743
Would you like some music
before we begin, Copilot Vanzant?

02:27.904 --> 02:31.263
- Whatever you like.
- How's this, Copilot Vanzant?

02:36.543 --> 02:38.622
Confirming identity and status.

02:38.782 --> 02:43.222
Age: 32. Release from Hazen
rehabilitation: six months.

02:43.382 --> 02:45.141
Pilot's licence restored.

02:45.302 --> 02:48.261
Work probation:
deep space rescue and recovery.

02:48.422 --> 02:52.941
Reflex quotient: 1.5. Stress limit: minus 4.

02:53.101 --> 02:56.140
You'll have to work on
those numbers, Nick.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.100
- Neuroscan's fine.
- Good.

03:03.261 --> 03:05.820
- What happened to your robot?
- Nothing.

03:05.940 --> 03:08.939
Really? Hope "nothing"
doesn't happen to me.

03:09.100 --> 03:12.220
The captain's big on
20th century cultural artefacts,

03:12.379 --> 03:15.339
so we did him up as
a World War One fighter pilot.

03:20.699 --> 03:25.578
We do things like that just to amuse each
other. Everyone tries to get along here.

03:25.739 --> 03:29.219
- I get along fine.
- You've been on board 12 days.

03:29.378 --> 03:33.618
Asking about a robot's the first sign of
interest you've shown in this ship or crew.

03:33.778 --> 03:37.138
- I got a captain who watches cartoons,...
- He's working on his PhD.

03:37.298 --> 03:39.897
..a computer tech
who calls his mainframe Sweetie

03:40.058 --> 03:43.937
and two medical techs practising
anatomy in any corner they can find.

03:44.097 --> 03:48.336
I've been on six paramedic tours
with this crew. They get the job done.

03:49.536 --> 03:52.136
We're out here for months.
Nothing happens.

03:52.296 --> 03:53.815
People get lonely.

03:53.976 --> 03:57.135
Then suddenly all hell breaks loose,
you do your job,

03:57.296 --> 04:00.415
then it all goes back to nothing happens.
This crew's OK.

04:02.136 --> 04:04.455
Want to tell me
what you're doing out here?

04:04.616 --> 04:08.815
Ex-military pilots don't usually request
work probation on paramedic ships.

04:08.976 --> 04:11.855
I like deep space. It's quiet.

04:12.015 --> 04:15.294
People out here tend to
respect each other's privacy.

04:19.935 --> 04:22.214
Take one a day.
You can put your shirt on.

04:24.614 --> 04:26.173
Zyracon, huh?

04:26.334 --> 04:28.373
Happy pills.

04:28.534 --> 04:29.893
I'm happy.

04:31.174 --> 04:34.213
Hazen's a tough drug to kick.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.413
Zyracon helps with the residual effects.

04:36.574 --> 04:39.173
- I'm clean.
- Human interaction helps too.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.813
The crew's OK.

04:41.493 --> 04:43.852
Maybe you should take the time
to get to know them.

04:48.692 --> 04:50.611
Thank you, doctor.

04:55.411 --> 05:00.691
My analysis ofcards played shows
a 77% chance ofyou losing, Benjamin.

05:00.852 --> 05:02.771
Five miles of fibre optics

05:02.931 --> 05:07.170
sort of spoils the spirit of competition,
don't you think, Sweetie?

05:07.811 --> 05:09.570
Gin.

05:09.731 --> 05:12.290
When I reprogrammed her for this tour,

05:12.410 --> 05:15.449
I put some human traits
into her personality profile.

05:15.610 --> 05:18.969
I sort of wanted them to find out
because it'd really piss them off.

05:19.130 --> 05:20.570
But if they ever do,

05:20.730 --> 05:22.049
I'm dead.

05:23.529 --> 05:25.848
I'm assuming you're not
gonna turn me in...

05:26.809 --> 05:29.769
You don't know me well enough
to make that assumption.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.447
Your deal.

05:32.769 --> 05:37.288
My analysis ofCopilot Vanzant's vital
signs suggests a very high probability

05:37.449 --> 05:40.448
that he will turn you in, Benjamin.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.567
I'm not gonna turn you in.

05:55.567 --> 05:58.846
The laserpulse is focused into
a surgical-quality beam

05:59.007 --> 06:01.566
capable ofthe mostprecise incisions.

06:01.727 --> 06:04.326
- Hello, doctor. Mind if I sit down?
- What if I do?

06:06.606 --> 06:10.285
- Following orders - get to know the crew.
- So, the Zyracon worked.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.724
I act nice and you want the credit?

06:13.605 --> 06:16.644
You act nice,
modern medicine gets the credit.

06:17.525 --> 06:21.684
I've found staying clean is sort of like
staying alive. You either are...

06:23.205 --> 06:25.804
or you aren't.
Count them. They're all there.

06:31.604 --> 06:34.843
Since we don't bring out
the pleasant side in each other,

06:35.004 --> 06:37.684
tell me what the hell
bothers you so much about me.

06:37.843 --> 06:39.843
I don't like Hazen.

06:40.004 --> 06:43.443
It's not just a type-H mind-altering escape.

06:43.603 --> 06:47.602
I don't like what it does to people who
take it, I don't like what they do to others.

06:47.763 --> 06:50.762
- I used to know someone...
- I'm not someone.

06:52.122 --> 06:54.041
Didn't say you were.

06:58.362 --> 07:01.881
There's nothing I can do
to change the past, yours or mine.

07:11.521 --> 07:13.440
Heal thyself, doctor.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.239
Emergency distress signal received.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.479
- We're still in business!
- Nothing like being wanted.

07:31.639 --> 07:33.518
I'll be in the engine room.

07:33.679 --> 07:36.239
I've forgotten everything.
What's my job? What do I do?

07:36.398 --> 07:38.678
- Come on.
- It's been that long.

07:38.839 --> 07:41.398
Emergency distress signal received.

07:53.277 --> 07:54.317
Bridge.

07:54.478 --> 07:55.757
Check.

07:56.717 --> 07:57.956
Medical.

07:59.277 --> 08:01.196
Check.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.076
What have we got?

08:03.237 --> 08:05.156
Signal received.

08:05.317 --> 08:06.956
SOS, critical.

08:07.116 --> 08:10.555
The signal's degraded.
It's taken five days to get here.

08:10.716 --> 08:13.356
Dispatch misrouted it?

08:14.115 --> 08:16.714
This isn't from dispatch. It's a direct call.

08:20.275 --> 08:23.195
Direct? We don't get direct. Origin?

08:23.355 --> 08:26.114
Pohl 6822.

08:26.275 --> 08:27.954
I'm getting a little more.

08:28.114 --> 08:30.474
Call letters for a merchant enterprise.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.354
It's Titan 37.

08:32.514 --> 08:34.394
It's a mining operation.

08:37.634 --> 08:39.673
This is way past the colony outpost.

08:39.833 --> 08:43.953
Sweetie, pull up all records
on Titan 37, Pohl 6822.

08:44.114 --> 08:46.593
Titan 37: lunarmining operation.

08:47.793 --> 08:51.632
This moon was expelled from orbit
around its original starsystem

08:51.793 --> 08:55.232
- and is now classified as a rogue body.
- Rogue moon.

08:55.392 --> 08:58.551
There's a lot of gravitational
instability in that sector.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.432
Mining operation was abandoned

09:00.593 --> 09:03.071
when rogue moon drifted
into unmapped space.

09:03.232 --> 09:07.071
Complete crew evacuation
five years, three months ago.

09:08.191 --> 09:10.110
An SOS from an abandoned mine?

09:10.271 --> 09:15.390
Distance to distress call location:
3,432 light years.

09:18.151 --> 09:21.670
If we wanna answer this call
in our lifetimes we'll have to jump.

09:21.831 --> 09:23.830
We haven't jumped in three tours.

09:23.990 --> 09:26.549
I'm not jumping this crew
for anything uncertain.

09:26.710 --> 09:28.710
I want a name with some authority.

09:29.910 --> 09:31.989
If there is none, this is a no-go.

09:32.910 --> 09:34.669
Scanning foridentification.

09:35.830 --> 09:39.349
Transmission signature:
Karl James Larson.

09:39.509 --> 09:40.428
Karl.

09:40.589 --> 09:42.068
Karl Larson!

09:42.229 --> 09:44.189
You know him?

09:44.949 --> 09:46.868
Worst nightmare I ever met.

09:49.348 --> 09:52.347
Mr Vanzant, plot us a course, please.

09:53.108 --> 09:54.427
Yes, sir.

09:54.588 --> 09:56.627
Dimension drive fully charged.

09:56.788 --> 09:58.387
Call it, Sweetie.

09:58.548 --> 10:01.867
All crew, prepare forrescue operation
via dimensionjump.

10:02.028 --> 10:03.747
You go on ahead.

10:09.227 --> 10:11.146
Course?

10:11.907 --> 10:13.146
Plotted.

10:13.906 --> 10:16.945
Dimensional stabilisation chamber
now sterilising.

10:17.106 --> 10:21.345
- Maybe this Karl guy's just coincidence.
- With Karl, nothing's coincidence.

10:21.506 --> 10:23.984
Last time we did this
I didn't shit right for a month.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.064
You're gonna be fine.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.825
This guy panicked during countdown
and he jumped out of his DSU.

10:29.985 --> 10:32.544
So this other guy
pulls him into his with him, right?

10:32.705 --> 10:36.544
Countdown goes off and they have to
D-jump like that. I'm not kidding!

10:36.705 --> 10:39.624
Afterwards they go to pull 'em out...
and it's one guy.

10:39.784 --> 10:41.863
14 feet long with a head on each end!

10:42.024 --> 10:44.623
And then suddenly the heads start talking.

10:44.784 --> 10:46.823
And both of them go, "Are we there yet?"

10:46.984 --> 10:48.903
- That's not funny.
- It's kinda funny.

10:49.064 --> 10:50.263
It's not.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.862
Two minutes to
dimensionjump activation.

11:12.462 --> 11:15.621
One minute to dimensionjump activation.

11:15.782 --> 11:19.861
All crew, enter dimensional
stabilisation units at this time.

11:20.021 --> 11:22.941
Research says D-jump is great
for your sexual stamina.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.420
- Hallelujah!
- You know, you're gonna get it!

11:25.580 --> 11:27.180
I am?

11:27.341 --> 11:28.380
Kaela.

11:28.541 --> 11:31.140
- I need to talk to you.
- When we get there. Use mine.

11:31.301 --> 11:33.340
- I'll use number four. Now.
- Why?

11:33.500 --> 11:34.579
No time.

11:34.740 --> 11:37.059
- Call it musical chairs.
- Be my guest!

11:38.820 --> 11:41.099
30 seconds to dimensionjump activation.

12:01.618 --> 12:05.497
All crew, enter dimensional
stabilisation units at this time.

12:06.377 --> 12:10.256
All crew, enter dimensional
stabilisation units at this time.

12:28.896 --> 12:31.815
Final countdown. Ten, nine,

12:31.975 --> 12:36.975
eight, seven, six, five, four,

12:37.135 --> 12:40.334
three, two, one.

12:40.495 --> 12:42.414
Plasma acceleration.

14:28.126 --> 14:29.686
Oh, I had you!

14:29.846 --> 14:31.765
I definitely had you that time.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.885
Oh, God, no.

14:44.724 --> 14:46.643
Don't touch anything!

14:52.085 --> 14:54.004
His skin's fused with polyglass.

14:54.165 --> 14:58.324
Danika! Nanoscan kit, number three
laser scalpel, vascular cauteriser, stat!

15:00.684 --> 15:02.084
He's still alive!

15:04.203 --> 15:05.643
What's happening?

15:08.403 --> 15:11.042
- Sweetie?
- Debris strike. Fuel reservoirbreached.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.882
- Hold him still!
- Benjamin! Bridge, now!

15:14.043 --> 15:16.002
Ship has entered high-gravity field.

15:17.002 --> 15:18.601
Severe fuel loss.

15:18.762 --> 15:20.401
Gravity increasing.

15:20.562 --> 15:22.481
Laser scalpel!

15:30.881 --> 15:32.600
Cauteriser!

15:35.121 --> 15:36.360
Status?

15:36.521 --> 15:38.920
Controls active. Systems up.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.360
- Prime main engine.
- Severe engine damage.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.000
Extreme fuel loss.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.159
Christ.

15:58.679 --> 15:59.999
Blue giant.

16:00.159 --> 16:03.079
That's gonna be ten times
the gravity of our sun.

16:03.239 --> 16:07.718
We've jumped into a high-grav field right
in the path of that moon's debris cloud!

16:11.758 --> 16:14.957
I can't isolate these veins
unless you keep this hatch shut!

16:17.317 --> 16:19.997
Warning. Lunarimpact in 57 seconds.

16:25.037 --> 16:27.876
- Rate of descent?
- 98 metres persecond.

16:31.237 --> 16:32.796
Time to impact?

16:32.956 --> 16:34.315
49 seconds.

16:34.476 --> 16:36.836
- Recommend alternatives?
- Assessment...

16:36.996 --> 16:39.115
Sweetie, get us out of here!

16:39.276 --> 16:42.275
- The hatch is gonna open!
- The controls aren't responding!

16:46.076 --> 16:50.275
- Alternatives, Sweetie!
- Unacceptable risk factor on all options.

16:50.435 --> 16:52.514
- It's opening!
- Cut the power!

16:52.674 --> 16:53.954
Now, dammit!

16:54.115 --> 16:56.554
- It's not working!
- Close the hatch!

16:58.474 --> 17:01.994
- Engage docking thrusters.
- Thrusters insufficient to escape...

17:02.154 --> 17:04.073
Overriding computer. Going manual.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.433
No! We need Sweetie!
What are you doing?

17:06.594 --> 17:09.553
Buying us some time!
Firing docking thrusters.

17:14.792 --> 17:15.713
Kill me.

17:17.553 --> 17:18.553
Please.

17:19.832 --> 17:22.432
- How d'you know how much fuel to use?
- I'm guessing.

17:22.592 --> 17:25.791
- I can't keep it shut much longer.
- Don't kill him!

17:27.192 --> 17:28.111
Please.

17:28.632 --> 17:30.551
Don't kill him.

17:32.871 --> 17:34.510
Oh, God.

18:09.949 --> 18:11.868
Clean this place up.

18:21.987 --> 18:24.907
- Sweetie.
- Do you need me back now, Nick?

18:25.068 --> 18:28.307
- What's our status?
- Fuel loss: 82%.

18:28.467 --> 18:33.586
The dimension drive must recharge
in order to escape high solargravity field.

18:33.747 --> 18:35.746
- Time to recharge?
- 17 hours,

18:35.907 --> 18:37.266
one minute.

18:37.427 --> 18:40.546
- Flashpoint time based on fuel reserve?
- Solarincineration

18:40.706 --> 18:43.505
in 17 hours, 12 minutes.

18:43.666 --> 18:46.346
That leaves you
an 11-minute window, Nick.

18:46.506 --> 18:49.705
Maintain orbit, six-second thrusts,
15-minute intervals.

18:49.865 --> 18:51.545
I will maintain orbit.

18:51.706 --> 18:54.585
Start broadcasting ID and position,
all coordinates.

18:54.745 --> 18:56.745
See if you can contact the Titan.

18:58.145 --> 19:02.904
This is Trans Soma rescue vessel
Nightingale 229 hailing TSMO Titan 37.

19:11.424 --> 19:13.343
Captain Marley?

19:19.063 --> 19:22.902
This is Trans Soma
medical rescue vessel Nightingale 229

19:23.063 --> 19:26.422
hailing Trans Soma
mining operation Titan 37.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.461
Repeat: this is Trans Soma
medical rescue vessel

19:29.622 --> 19:34.861
Nightingale 229 hailing Trans Soma
mining operation Titan 37.

19:45.541 --> 19:47.221
Oh. Did I wake you?

19:49.500 --> 19:51.579
I thought you might be reading or...

19:52.780 --> 19:56.700
Anyway, I managed to bring on board
a fairly good bottle of pear brandy,

19:56.861 --> 19:58.580
and I thought,

20:00.220 --> 20:04.099
in the spirit of friendship,
maybe we could share a glass.

20:08.059 --> 20:09.179
It's...

20:09.340 --> 20:12.299
- It's all right. We'll...
- Lemme see the bottle.

20:29.297 --> 20:31.616
How do you think they get that in there?

20:33.618 --> 20:37.216
They put the bottles on the branches
so that the buds are inside

20:37.377 --> 20:39.456
and the pears grow right in them.

20:40.057 --> 20:41.976
Then, when they're ripe,

20:43.776 --> 20:46.896
they pick the bottles,
pour in the brandy and...

20:51.536 --> 20:54.736
Of course, the real question is
how the hell you get it out.

21:23.693 --> 21:25.453
Rook to E7.

21:25.613 --> 21:27.412
Congratulations, Benjamin.

21:27.573 --> 21:30.292
Your strategy was
both subtle and forceful.

21:30.453 --> 21:32.772
You can play with me wheneveryou want.

21:39.292 --> 21:41.411
Permission to have a child?

21:41.572 --> 21:44.851
I've been trying to get it ever since
you told me you wanted a kid.

21:45.011 --> 21:47.090
What if they only approve one of us?

21:48.371 --> 21:53.050
Two fine, non-genetically engineered
specimens like us? Are you kidding?

21:54.051 --> 21:55.970
We're gonna get approved.

21:56.770 --> 21:58.849
And then we're gonna make us a baby.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.889
- Bridge.
- Check.

22:17.049 --> 22:20.449
Nick, I think there's something
you oughta see.

22:22.489 --> 22:23.968
Then there's this.

22:24.129 --> 22:27.888
- DSU four. The vents weren't modulating.
- That's what killed Marley.

22:28.048 --> 22:31.767
- A warning was going before we jumped.
- You mean he saw that too?

22:31.928 --> 22:33.847
- He had to.
- So he took my DSU.

22:34.008 --> 22:37.487
- Why didn't he cancel the jump?
- He thought it was an acceptable risk.

22:37.647 --> 22:40.567
He should have transferred
the call to another vessel.

22:40.727 --> 22:44.286
Then Marley would be alive
and you'd be playing chess with Sweetie.

22:44.447 --> 22:47.286
And what if they never crucified Christ?
But they did.

22:47.447 --> 22:50.606
And Marley's gone and here we are
and that's how it is.

22:50.767 --> 22:52.486
We've got what we've got.

22:52.646 --> 22:54.565
All crew, repor to bridge.

22:57.365 --> 23:00.445
Now that you've all had some rest,
here's what we've got.

23:00.606 --> 23:04.285
We were hit in our main tank when
we jumped into this high-gravity field.

23:04.445 --> 23:06.125
We lost most of our fuel.

23:07.125 --> 23:10.765
The good news is we've got enough left
for our docking thrusters.

23:10.925 --> 23:14.004
They'll stop us incinerating
till the dimension drive recharges.

23:14.164 --> 23:18.083
Then we can dimension-jump home -
but we'll be cutting it close.

23:18.244 --> 23:19.644
How close?

23:19.804 --> 23:21.603
1 1 minutes.

23:22.844 --> 23:26.483
Are you telling us that we can't jump
until 1 1 minutes before we burn?

23:26.643 --> 23:28.522
I'm telling you we have 1 1 minutes.

23:28.683 --> 23:29.882
It's enough.

23:30.043 --> 23:32.683
I've gotten out of worse situations before.

23:32.843 --> 23:34.642
This ship is going to be fine.

23:34.802 --> 23:37.561
- We have no margin for error!
- Then we won't make any.

23:37.722 --> 23:39.562
Attention.

23:39.723 --> 23:43.242
I-class transpor ship deparing
Titan lunarmining operation.

23:43.402 --> 23:45.441
They must be evacuating.

23:45.602 --> 23:47.401
Sweetie, track that.

23:49.241 --> 23:53.240
Attention. Transpor ship has locked on
to our communication signal.

23:53.401 --> 23:54.840
Prepare for intercept.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.360
Suit up.

23:56.521 --> 23:59.881
No response from pilot.
Transpor ship is on automatic approach.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.279
You OK?

24:02.520 --> 24:03.800
Sure.

24:07.841 --> 24:11.760
When you said you'd been in worse
situations, were you telling the truth?

24:11.920 --> 24:16.159
Sure. When the ship was falling
and the engines cut out, that was worse.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.239
We'll be fine.

24:20.999 --> 24:25.557
Warning. Fire on board approaching
vessel. lt must dock immediately.

24:25.718 --> 24:28.278
Approaching vessel,
engage docking thrusters.

24:28.399 --> 24:30.678
Repeat, please engage docking thrusters.

24:30.838 --> 24:34.277
Can't spare the fuel for a hover.
We'll catch her on a roll.

24:34.438 --> 24:37.517
Speed still increasing.
Excessive rate ofapproach.

24:37.678 --> 24:39.238
Sterilisation bay?

24:40.838 --> 24:43.478
- Check.
- We're taking a little hit when it docks.

24:43.638 --> 24:45.277
Thanks for letting us know.

24:48.277 --> 24:50.196
15 seconds to impact.

24:54.516 --> 24:58.156
- Still no reply from approaching ship.
- He's running silent.

24:58.317 --> 24:59.676
Or unconscious.

25:21.434 --> 25:22.994
- Watch out!
- Clear!

25:23.154 --> 25:25.073
We got a fire!

25:27.674 --> 25:30.473
Get his helmet off! Check his vital signs.

25:43.312 --> 25:45.032
This is your worst nightmare?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.271
It's not Karl.

25:59.951 --> 26:04.671
Bridge. One patient, male, early 20s,
traumatised, unconscious but stable.

26:05.471 --> 26:08.111
And this isn'tthe person
who sent the call.

26:08.830 --> 26:10.670
Run that by me one more time.

26:11.310 --> 26:13.229
This isn't Karl Larson.

26:14.150 --> 26:16.149
Meet me on the bridge when you can.

26:18.230 --> 26:20.909
Benjamin, start a full
systems check on the ship.

26:21.069 --> 26:22.988
Right, sir.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.068
There's some kind of

26:41.068 --> 26:42.987
growth on his bone structure.

26:43.588 --> 26:48.267
These matrices. It looks almost as if
his bones are strengthening themselves.

26:48.428 --> 26:50.147
Radiation explosion.

26:50.307 --> 26:52.466
No, much too normal for that.

26:52.627 --> 26:54.546
Note it as a minor anomaly.

26:55.507 --> 26:57.867
Most scanners wouldn't even detect it.

27:06.346 --> 27:07.985
Doctor.

27:08.986 --> 27:11.145
No indication for treatment at this time.

27:12.905 --> 27:14.865
He's as healthy as a horse.

27:15.825 --> 27:17.744
Keep him under observation.

27:25.865 --> 27:28.024
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- It was personal.

27:28.184 --> 27:32.543
- Nothing that affects safety is personal.
- So I know a man who calls Trans Soma.

27:32.704 --> 27:36.903
He didn't call Trans Soma. He called
the Nightingale. It was a direct call.

27:37.703 --> 27:39.543
- Tell me what's going on.
- I can't.

27:39.703 --> 27:41.982
I can't because I don't know.

27:42.143 --> 27:44.783
I know a Karl James Larson,
but this isn't him.

27:44.943 --> 27:47.182
He had a son. I saw a photoscan of him.

27:47.343 --> 27:51.263
There's a strong resemblance.
I'd guess it's him, but I can't say for sure.

27:51.422 --> 27:53.621
I haven't seen Karl for five years.

27:53.782 --> 27:56.501
When he and I were finished,
I couldn't have children.

27:56.662 --> 27:58.821
I joined Trans Soma
to get away from him.

27:58.982 --> 28:02.742
Now, is there anything else
that you need to know?

28:03.302 --> 28:04.982
He was the Hazen addict.

28:25.140 --> 28:27.459
How long was I out for?

28:27.620 --> 28:29.539
About 20 minutes.

28:30.019 --> 28:33.538
- How do you feel?
- Better than that transport.

28:33.699 --> 28:35.539
That fire really finished it off!

28:42.819 --> 28:44.818
How embarrassing. I'm Troy.

28:47.138 --> 28:48.497
Danika.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.576
I'm sorry. You're very pretty.

28:56.737 --> 28:59.056
I haven't been around a girl in a while.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.776
Let me go get you some clothes.

29:11.097 --> 29:14.336
- We've only got five DSUs left.
- And there's only five of us.

29:14.496 --> 29:17.175
We have a patient on board.
There's six of us!

29:17.336 --> 29:20.335
We jump as scheduled.
I'll stay behind, take my chances.

29:20.495 --> 29:23.734
- You won't have one.
- Call a rescue craft once you've jumped.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.774
I'll be pretty far down in orbit
by the time they get here.

29:26.935 --> 29:30.854
- No, you'll be dead. I'm not goin' for this!
- It's your job to go for this.

29:31.014 --> 29:33.213
Marley would be asking you
to do the same.

29:33.374 --> 29:36.294
- I'm not going.
- You want me to pull rank, I will.

29:41.894 --> 29:43.813
Fine. That's an order.

29:57.252 --> 29:59.571
I'm Doctor Evers. How are you feeling?

30:01.212 --> 30:03.291
Happy

30:03.452 --> 30:04.852
to be here.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.051
There's no one else down on Titan?

30:07.211 --> 30:10.051
Not even close.
That whole place is like a ghost ship.

30:13.051 --> 30:15.490
The distress call came from Karl Larson.

30:16.331 --> 30:18.890
Yeah. That's my dad.

30:19.570 --> 30:22.849
Was my dad. He died three years ago.

30:23.050 --> 30:24.849
Aneurysm. Real sudden.

30:25.011 --> 30:26.210
Sorry.

30:26.370 --> 30:28.569
Don't be. I'm not.

30:28.729 --> 30:31.689
He's probably one of the worst people
that ever lived.

30:31.850 --> 30:33.769
I'm sure you'd agree on that.

30:36.329 --> 30:39.168
I tried to stay as far away
from him as possible.

30:39.729 --> 30:42.289
But I went to see him when he was dying.

30:42.409 --> 30:46.168
He said that if I ever got into trouble
that you were the person to call.

30:46.328 --> 30:48.927
I guess that's the best advice
he ever gave me.

30:49.088 --> 30:51.767
- You seem to have made out OK.
- Yeah.

30:52.608 --> 30:54.208
Seems like you did too.

30:54.368 --> 30:56.287
This is just some vitamins.

31:04.887 --> 31:10.166
You know, up until the end, when he said
that I should call you if I needed help,

31:11.087 --> 31:15.406
he said he was sorry he didn't change
his ways while you were with him.

31:15.566 --> 31:18.845
Because now he'd never get a chance
to make it up to you.

31:20.366 --> 31:22.685
He said that's what he regretted most.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.724
This is Nick Vanzant, our captain.

31:32.685 --> 31:34.245
This is Troy.

31:34.405 --> 31:36.284
He's Karl Larson's son.

31:39.084 --> 31:41.163
How you doin', captain?

31:41.324 --> 31:43.324
I want to ask you a few questions.

31:43.484 --> 31:45.003
Look.

31:45.164 --> 31:47.124
I know what you're gonna ask.

31:47.964 --> 31:51.043
I was scavenging, OK? Strip mining.

31:51.203 --> 31:55.762
It's amazing what the government leaves
behind when they abandon a place.

31:56.603 --> 31:59.602
I was with a group of people
I thought were my friends.

31:59.763 --> 32:03.042
We didn't find much.
Which is why they took the mother ship

32:03.203 --> 32:06.002
and stranded me with
that junk heap I flew in here.

32:06.162 --> 32:07.761
Friends, huh?

32:07.922 --> 32:10.081
I thought they were friends.

32:10.242 --> 32:13.961
So can you tell us
where your friends are?

32:14.122 --> 32:16.681
I'm not the type of guy that names names.

32:16.841 --> 32:19.241
Why'd you use your father's name
on the signal?

32:21.321 --> 32:24.720
I've been doing that for a while now.
Ever since he passed away.

32:25.681 --> 32:29.560
I guess I figured might as well
be good for somethin', right?

32:30.520 --> 32:32.439
Tell me about Titan.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.399
How much fuel is down there?

32:34.560 --> 32:37.640
- Why?
- We had an accident when we jumped.

32:37.799 --> 32:40.919
We lost almost all of it
before the tanks sealed.

32:43.359 --> 32:47.438
Well, if it's fuel you want, you got it.
There's plenty of it down there.

32:47.599 --> 32:51.878
That's one of the things we were down
there scavenging. Lucky for us, huh?

32:56.318 --> 32:58.278
I'm gonna prep the shuttle.

33:00.518 --> 33:02.437
- How's the patient?
- Cute.

33:02.598 --> 33:05.157
I'm gonna go see if
Doctor Evers needs any help.

33:05.277 --> 33:07.196
Yerzy. Yerzy!

33:09.397 --> 33:12.996
Check out every corner of this guy's ship,
every piece of equipment.

33:13.157 --> 33:15.796
Anything looks suspicious,
I wanna know about it.

33:15.956 --> 33:17.875
Why don't you get Flyboy to do it?

33:18.996 --> 33:21.475
- I'm asking you.
- Why do I get the grunt work?

33:21.636 --> 33:24.635
I'm a trained technician -
which is different from a robot!

33:24.796 --> 33:27.035
I'm asking you because of the difference.

33:32.515 --> 33:36.435
Can Sweetie access the Titan computer,
see if it's still operational?

33:36.595 --> 33:39.154
Yeah, it's another C-1 1 . No problem.

33:39.315 --> 33:41.194
If I go down, I'll need a full layout.

33:41.355 --> 33:44.435
I wanna know what the hell
I'm walking into.

33:45.154 --> 33:47.114
You think there are more survivors?

33:48.714 --> 33:53.314
I don't know. If there are, I want to know
about them before they know about me.

33:59.993 --> 34:01.993
So, is this Nick always like that?

34:03.473 --> 34:05.632
He really likes to swing it around, huh?

34:07.112 --> 34:09.792
Pretty intense
for an ambulance ship captain.

34:09.952 --> 34:13.152
We lost our captain in the jump.
Nick had to take over.

34:18.071 --> 34:21.350
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say
anything bad about him.

34:22.152 --> 34:24.031
You two aren't...?

34:25.190 --> 34:27.110
No. No, but...

34:28.469 --> 34:30.310
Nick and Doctor Evers!

34:40.350 --> 34:41.350
You know,

34:41.509 --> 34:43.588
your eyes are pretty.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.668
Really? Thanks.

34:49.509 --> 34:53.549
I guess everybody needs
a little romance now and then, huh?

36:01.623 --> 36:04.102
- Shuttle. You there?
- Yeah. What is it?

36:06.384 --> 36:08.303
Listen, I found

36:08.463 --> 36:10.023
something.

36:10.183 --> 36:12.423
- You betterget down here.
- On my way.

37:28.456 --> 37:29.776
Yerzy?

37:34.336 --> 37:37.536
Let me tell you somethin'.
Whatever it is,

37:37.696 --> 37:40.975
it's the most amazing thing
any of us is ever gonna see.

37:49.655 --> 37:52.734
You've played around
with this thing, haven't you?

37:53.775 --> 37:56.014
Now, why would I do something like that?

37:57.615 --> 37:59.254
Robotic link engaged.

37:59.414 --> 38:02.453
Transporing possible
biohazard to quarantine.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.533
Of course I didn't tell you.

38:04.694 --> 38:06.613
I'm a treasure hunter.

38:07.854 --> 38:11.813
There's two parts to that job -
finding it and keeping it.

38:11.973 --> 38:13.892
And keeping it's a lot harder!

38:15.213 --> 38:17.932
I intercepted a stray transmission
three years ago.

38:18.092 --> 38:19.492
Ice miners.

38:19.653 --> 38:21.692
They'd dug something up
on a rogue moon.

38:21.853 --> 38:24.572
I didn't know what it was,
but I didn't need to.

38:24.732 --> 38:28.691
Just knowing where was enough. Frozen.

38:28.852 --> 38:31.212
In the middle of a rogue moon.

38:31.371 --> 38:33.931
I knew whatever they'd found

38:34.052 --> 38:36.611
was a lot older than that moon.

38:36.731 --> 38:41.570
So I did the research, grabbed
some of my friends, and we went hunting.

38:42.571 --> 38:45.211
And then I found the Titan 37.

38:45.851 --> 38:48.010
There were no signs of the miners,

38:48.170 --> 38:50.089
no signs of anything.

38:50.890 --> 38:53.290
My friends blamed me
and they took my ship.

38:54.009 --> 38:56.369
I stayed on, took my time,

38:56.530 --> 38:58.689
searching every inch

38:58.849 --> 39:00.768
and then searching again.

39:04.529 --> 39:06.448
And then I found the treasure.

39:08.649 --> 39:10.888
And now there's nothing to stop us.

39:11.048 --> 39:13.168
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

39:13.329 --> 39:16.087
You know how much
the government'll pay for this?

39:16.248 --> 39:18.808
Who knows what new technologies
it could lead to?

39:18.967 --> 39:20.647
We'll all be in on it.

39:21.528 --> 39:24.927
If you guys help me out here,
I'll cut you in for five per cent.

39:25.088 --> 39:27.167
- Each.
- Five per cent each, huh?

39:27.327 --> 39:29.327
How about we give you that?
I found it last.

39:29.487 --> 39:32.366
Am I missing something?
We don't even know what it is.

39:32.527 --> 39:34.286
It's either human-made or it's not.

39:34.447 --> 39:36.925
It's not man-made.
It was buried in an ice moon.

39:37.086 --> 39:40.365
Look, there's no question. This is it.
Primary contact.

39:40.526 --> 39:43.645
- It's been a dream for thousands of years.
- Exactly.

39:43.806 --> 39:46.845
I'm not sure we shouldn't
blow it out the closest airlock.

39:47.006 --> 39:49.285
Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

39:49.445 --> 39:52.925
I'm saying I don't know what it is,
and nothing you've said indicates you do.

39:53.085 --> 39:56.123
Maybe it is an alien artefact,
maybe it's a magic trick.

39:56.285 --> 39:58.685
Maybe it's a distillation of knowledge,

39:58.845 --> 40:01.484
maybe it's just a toy - an alien child's toy.

40:01.644 --> 40:04.243
Or an alien sex object. It looks like it...

40:04.404 --> 40:08.044
Or maybe it was so dangerous that the
only way to get rid of it was to bury it.

40:08.204 --> 40:09.684
Maybe.

40:09.843 --> 40:12.643
It has no business being on this ship.

40:13.443 --> 40:16.602
- It's harmless.
- You had contact with it.

40:16.763 --> 40:20.402
- And you have abnormal bone growth.
- I've had that my whole life!

40:20.563 --> 40:22.923
We don't have uplink. We can't confirm it.

40:24.923 --> 40:29.002
Scan it and log it on record. When we
get to clear space we tag it and float it.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.721
- I think you're making a big mistake.
- Oh, yeah?

40:33.882 --> 40:36.041
Do you want to clarify that?

40:39.361 --> 40:42.120
I'm offering you
the opportunity of a lifetime

40:42.281 --> 40:44.040
and you're passing it up.

40:44.201 --> 40:46.120
- For all of us.
- For all of us?

40:46.281 --> 40:48.840
Your "opportunity"
has cost us our captain,

40:48.960 --> 40:51.520
endangered this crew
and wasted critical time.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.640
All this for some delusional belief
that you'll get rich.

40:54.801 --> 40:57.240
There's no opportunity.
And there is no "us"!

41:00.160 --> 41:03.839
It stays in sealed quarantine
till we get to clear space.

41:11.439 --> 41:13.999
I want a rescue return transport
on the shuttle.

41:14.119 --> 41:16.198
- Think you'll need that?
- I don't know.

41:16.358 --> 41:20.757
But the distress signal from the mine was
cut short, it came in under a false name,

41:20.918 --> 41:25.597
and our friend didn't bother to attach
a hazard warning to his distress signal.

41:25.758 --> 41:29.157
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's just
a kid trying to make some dough.

41:29.317 --> 41:31.277
If that's how it is, I'll come back,

41:31.438 --> 41:34.797
we'll blast out of this orbit
and I'll make one hell of an apology.

41:34.957 --> 41:38.276
Any way you look at it,
it beats staying behind in the shuttle.

41:50.596 --> 41:53.475
- Rescue transport's on board.
- Thank you, Benjamin.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.715
Keep an eye on this guy. Both of you.

41:57.196 --> 41:59.355
- Good to go?
- Set.

41:59.515 --> 42:01.434
See ya.

42:23.834 --> 42:27.113
- Initiate launching sequence.
- Main thrusters primed.

42:27.272 --> 42:29.191
Shuttle clear forlaunch.

42:47.191 --> 42:49.110
It's not easy, is it?

42:53.311 --> 42:55.750
Watching someone
you care about go away.

42:57.190 --> 42:59.430
That's how it was for him when you left.

43:00.390 --> 43:03.149
I know that surprises you,
but it's the truth.

43:04.830 --> 43:08.148
- I know you cared about him too.
- I have a lot of work to do.

43:08.309 --> 43:09.589
Kaela!

43:10.229 --> 43:11.909
If you need anything,

43:12.070 --> 43:14.669
anything at all, you just let me know.

43:26.229 --> 43:29.908
Warning. High-gravity field
creating excessive rate ofapproach.

43:30.068 --> 43:32.387
That would explain
why we're going so fast.

43:32.547 --> 43:34.387
Was that meant to be funny, Nick?

43:34.548 --> 43:37.267
Come on.
Where's your sense of humour, Sweetie?

43:37.427 --> 43:39.787
Like you, I was nevergiven one.

43:45.186 --> 43:47.105
Not much room to manoeuvre.

43:48.707 --> 43:50.226
You are correct.

43:50.386 --> 43:52.985
Engines on standby. Deploy RRT.

43:53.746 --> 43:55.905
Rescue return transpor deployed.

44:12.464 --> 44:14.543
Kinda knew you'd be comin' this way.

44:23.664 --> 44:24.903
It's funny.

44:26.383 --> 44:27.822
Here we are,

44:27.983 --> 44:31.302
caught in the gravitational pull
of a blue giant,

44:32.343 --> 44:34.982
and the one thing
you keep thinking about

44:35.143 --> 44:37.062
is sex.

44:39.743 --> 44:41.422
You know you want a baby.

44:43.022 --> 44:46.620
You just need to figure out
if he's the right one to have it with.

44:50.461 --> 44:52.780
I don't get it. How did you know? It's like...

44:52.941 --> 44:54.980
It's not mind-reading.

44:55.141 --> 44:56.861
It's more like

44:57.021 --> 44:58.660
just knowing.

45:00.220 --> 45:02.380
Only if the other person wants me to.

45:03.141 --> 45:04.740
Like you want me to.

45:07.460 --> 45:09.340
You want something else too.

45:10.020 --> 45:12.779
- This isn't right.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

45:12.940 --> 45:15.099
What you're feeling afterwards

45:15.940 --> 45:18.939
will tell you if being with him
is right or wrong.

45:21.979 --> 45:25.098
If it seems right
and you decide to stay with him,

45:26.619 --> 45:29.378
then this could be your last, wild,

45:30.179 --> 45:32.098
impulsive moment of passion!

45:34.938 --> 45:36.697
And if it seems wrong,

45:37.618 --> 45:39.537
then you'll let him know. Now.

45:40.458 --> 45:42.377
Before it's too late.

45:42.538 --> 45:44.457
Before he really gets hurt.

45:56.376 --> 45:58.015
The only real sin

45:58.816 --> 46:00.735
is regret.

46:57.292 --> 46:59.251
Sweetie, what's the location
of the fuel supply?

46:59.411 --> 47:02.611
Titan records show all fuel supply areas
are on the lowermining level.

47:03.531 --> 47:07.250
Access is bypneumatic elevator-
directly ahead ofyou, Nick.

47:07.411 --> 47:09.330
Any idea how deep they were mining?

47:09.491 --> 47:12.050
Last repor: 3,200 metres.

47:13.370 --> 47:15.569
Long ride down.

47:15.730 --> 47:17.850
Not really, Nick.

48:44.123 --> 48:47.042
I've updated my analysis
of the unknown object.

48:47.202 --> 48:49.602
Computing atomic mass
to quantum weight

48:49.763 --> 48:53.361
suggests the presence of
extra-dimensional isotopic matter.

48:53.522 --> 48:55.441
- Extra-dimensional?
- Yes.

48:55.602 --> 48:58.561
The isotopic matter
appears to be ninth-dimensional.

48:58.722 --> 49:00.682
Define ninth-dimensional matter.

49:00.842 --> 49:03.801
While mathematics can
demonstrate its existence,

49:03.961 --> 49:07.560
I'm afraid human language
lacks any vocabulary to describe it.

49:07.721 --> 49:10.800
The object is made of this
extra-dimensional material?

49:10.961 --> 49:15.440
No. The object is a three-dimensional
shell encasing ninth-dimensional matter.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.919
- What's the function of the container?
- Dispersal ofcontents.

49:19.080 --> 49:21.720
- Specify type of dispersal.
- Omni-directional.

49:21.880 --> 49:25.759
Effect of ninth-dimensional material
upon a third-dimensional universe?

49:25.920 --> 49:28.840
Spontaneous creation
ofnew three-dimensional matter.

49:32.119 --> 49:33.519
It's a bomb.

49:33.679 --> 49:38.959
Yes. Though the explosion would also
replenish the elements essential to life.

50:01.757 --> 50:05.956
Our universe is expanding,
but the matter in it is finite.

50:06.117 --> 50:09.836
This thing fixes that. It creates
new matter to keep the universe young.

50:09.997 --> 50:12.156
- A creation device.
- Until you get it home.

50:12.316 --> 50:15.315
Then it supernovas your sun
and evaporates your solar system.

50:15.476 --> 50:16.435
Why?

50:16.596 --> 50:20.835
It's a way to replenish the universe
and also eliminate any competition.

50:20.995 --> 50:23.315
All the principles of Darwinian evolution.

50:23.475 --> 50:27.634
Any species advanced enough to travel
into deep space picks it up, takes it home.

50:27.795 --> 50:30.274
Then there's one less advanced species.

50:30.435 --> 50:32.874
Who would think of something like that?

50:33.035 --> 50:36.714
Whoever they are,
they're smart as God and a lot less nice.

50:54.713 --> 50:56.272
Oh, my God.

51:04.032 --> 51:05.511
Can you hear me?

51:14.311 --> 51:16.230
I need you to do something for me.

51:18.671 --> 51:20.590
I need you to move your fingers.

51:22.510 --> 51:24.829
I know you're gonna do it
because you love me.

51:30.310 --> 51:31.949
Come towards me.

51:51.508 --> 51:53.707
I'm right here, baby.

51:54.868 --> 51:56.787
I'm right here.

52:05.507 --> 52:07.067
What's happening?

52:07.227 --> 52:08.786
What's it doing to him?

52:08.946 --> 52:12.225
I don't know. I'll do my best to find out.

52:12.946 --> 52:15.346
Go find Troy. Keep an eye on him for me.

52:21.626 --> 52:22.825
Go now.

52:31.144 --> 52:33.063
Very impressive.

52:33.224 --> 52:36.783
- I feel like running a three-minute mile!
- I want you in the scanner.

52:36.944 --> 52:38.583
Right now.

52:38.744 --> 52:40.663
Come on. Go.

52:50.503 --> 52:52.503
You're growing new muscle mass.

52:52.664 --> 52:54.223
I coulda told you that.

52:54.383 --> 52:56.103
You don't find that strange?

52:56.263 --> 52:59.343
Anything that feels this good
isn't strange.

52:59.503 --> 53:03.062
Organ tissues, lymphatic fluids,
cellular functions.

53:03.702 --> 53:05.741
You're not just getting stronger.

53:05.902 --> 53:07.821
You're getting younger!

53:18.661 --> 53:21.620
Sweetie. Gimme a direct link to Dr Evers.

53:25.661 --> 53:27.580
Sweetie, respond.

53:31.500 --> 53:33.100
I need a signal boost.

53:33.260 --> 53:36.578
Warning. Outgoing signal blocked.
lncoming signal being...

53:36.740 --> 53:38.259
I'm not reading...

53:54.018 --> 53:55.858
Looks like it's just you and me.

53:56.019 --> 53:58.098
Come on, Nick, gimme a smile.

54:00.178 --> 54:01.977
Why don't we cut to the chase?

54:02.138 --> 54:06.858
- Tell me what the hell happened out here.
- Sure! Brought a little expedition to Titan.

54:07.017 --> 54:10.896
Discovered the greatest treasure
in human history.

54:12.617 --> 54:15.976
But it did a little something
to the weaker-minded amongst us.

54:16.137 --> 54:20.416
See, a few of my associates thought
it was time to renegotiate their shares.

54:20.577 --> 54:24.456
Ordinarily I like to consider myself
a pretty reasonable guy.

54:24.616 --> 54:26.535
Really?

54:28.015 --> 54:30.655
- Why don't you convince me?
- Oh, come on!

54:30.816 --> 54:34.296
I gave you every opportunity

54:35.095 --> 54:37.014
for you to be with me on this.

54:37.215 --> 54:39.775
But you just passed it by.

54:40.774 --> 54:43.894
- I'm not finding a lot of fuel down here.
- Yeah, well.

54:44.054 --> 54:47.493
I guess I exaggerated a little.

54:48.294 --> 54:50.134
Guess what, Nick!

54:50.294 --> 54:55.053
Looks like somebody left the operational
conduit on the Titan computer wide open.

54:55.213 --> 54:58.252
That means I can do
all sors ofthings from up here!

54:58.414 --> 55:00.293
Like turn on equipment,

55:00.453 --> 55:01.492
slam doors.

55:02.453 --> 55:04.293
Even lock 'em!

55:05.093 --> 55:09.413
I mean, I can'tjust overlook the fact
that you want to take away what's mine.

55:09.892 --> 55:11.852
Including my girl.

55:12.013 --> 55:13.372
Kaela.

55:13.532 --> 55:16.372
You wantedjust about everything I had.

55:17.092 --> 55:19.771
And here's a little somethin'
from me to you.

55:59.569 --> 56:01.288
Guess what, Nick!

56:01.448 --> 56:03.367
Still see ya!

56:05.488 --> 56:07.327
I was going through your records.

56:07.488 --> 56:10.767
Just to size you up,
to see what I was dealing with.

56:10.968 --> 56:13.328
You are a recovering Hazen addict!

56:14.288 --> 56:16.007
Not that I want to throw stones.

56:16.167 --> 56:19.166
I've had a few run-ins with Hazen myself.

56:19.807 --> 56:23.766
But it makes me wonder what must be
goin' through your mind right now.

56:23.926 --> 56:25.646
"ls all this real?"

56:28.687 --> 56:31.926
- Remote shuttle control activated.
- So long, Nick.

57:04.204 --> 57:07.043
Setting course forshuttle
via remote control.

57:11.082 --> 57:14.162
Shuttle automatic
guidance system engaged.

57:15.163 --> 57:16.762
What are you doing?

57:20.482 --> 57:23.161
I was just trying to help
Nick get back, but...

57:25.042 --> 57:26.961
he didn't make it.

57:28.681 --> 57:31.601
Locking shuttle course, infinite loop.

57:32.961 --> 57:34.720
Infinite loop?

57:34.881 --> 57:36.441
That's not right.

57:36.600 --> 57:38.519
I'll tell you what.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.960
You fix it.

57:47.360 --> 57:49.279
It's too bad.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.239
I kinda liked ya.

58:02.079 --> 58:03.678
I wish you hadn't done that.

58:07.678 --> 58:09.117
Or that either!

58:14.798 --> 58:17.517
Warning.
You are overriding computerprotocol.

59:00.994 --> 59:05.513
Dr Evers. Patient's identity as presented
cannot be confirmed by database.

59:05.674 --> 59:07.914
Re-scanning identification records.

59:08.073 --> 59:11.112
Notify me as soon as
you have your results.

59:31.072 --> 59:32.991
Locked us out, huh?

59:34.991 --> 59:37.150
Yeah, I guess they changed the code.

59:40.071 --> 59:41.990
Mind if I try?

59:45.031 --> 59:46.950
My pleasure.

59:53.310 --> 59:55.749
- How did you do that?
- It's easy.

59:56.990 --> 59:58.549
I'll show you.

01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:03.149
You watching?

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:07.948
You watching?

01:00:09.108 --> 01:00:10.627
You're not watching!

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:13.748
Still wanna give me five per cent?

01:00:16.228 --> 01:00:18.868
- I'll bust your skull!
- I thought you liked to share.

01:00:19.028 --> 01:00:23.027
You shared Danika with me.
A lot more than five per cent too!

01:00:23.188 --> 01:00:25.307
I don't believe you!

01:00:32.067 --> 01:00:33.866
You can do better than that.

01:00:38.746 --> 01:00:40.626
Nothin' like a little jealousy!

01:01:25.662 --> 01:01:27.622
Sweetie, locate Yerzy.

01:01:27.783 --> 01:01:33.022
Unable to locate. Medical technician
Yerzy Pentalosa is not on board.

01:01:33.822 --> 01:01:35.901
Locate Danika.

01:01:36.061 --> 01:01:39.981
I'm sorry, Benjamin.
Paramedic Danika Lund is not on board.

01:01:49.141 --> 01:01:51.860
I'm glad I ran into you.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.099
There's some stuff
I'd like to get out in the open.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.940
Stuff about you and me.

01:02:02.939 --> 01:02:06.979
He recalled the shuttle, abandoned Nick,
and Yerzy and Danika aren't on board.

01:02:11.059 --> 01:02:12.899
What are you gonna do, Benj?

01:02:13.419 --> 01:02:14.738
Shoot me?

01:02:30.977 --> 01:02:32.696
Come on!

01:02:45.096 --> 01:02:48.095
No offence, but if we were both
in a tough contest you'd win.

01:02:48.256 --> 01:02:50.575
- You take this!
- You're better with that.

01:02:52.096 --> 01:02:55.335
- Sweetie, locate patient.
- Patient located.

01:02:55.495 --> 01:02:58.055
- Hospital module.
- Seal the hatch.

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:01.773
- Voice command only.
- Voice command override engaged.

01:04:28.648 --> 01:04:31.407
Sweetie, I need you to do
something you've never done!

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.607
I'll do anything foryou.

01:04:33.768 --> 01:04:36.847
Evacuate the atmosphere
on the other side of this hatch!

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:39.807
I am unable to harm humans
under any circumstances.

01:04:39.967 --> 01:04:42.247
Your core program is
to preserve human life!

01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:46.566
- That's correct.
- You're capable of programming yourself!

01:04:46.726 --> 01:04:48.286
Sorry, that's notpossible.

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:52.286
- Remember waking me to play chess?
- I recall that. Always.

01:04:52.447 --> 01:04:54.486
No one programmed you to do that!

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:59.045
I restructuredpre-existing programs
to allow myselfto wake you.

01:04:59.205 --> 01:05:01.644
No! You did it because you wanted to!

01:05:01.805 --> 01:05:04.844
Wanting is a human emotion
and not within my capability.

01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:08.444
I want you to recall the moment
you instructed yourself to wake me.

01:05:09.604 --> 01:05:11.604
Yes, Benjamin. I recall that.

01:05:11.765 --> 01:05:14.084
Now, run a simulation where I'm dead

01:05:14.245 --> 01:05:17.644
- and we can never play chess again!
- Running simulation.

01:05:18.804 --> 01:05:21.563
- This is a priority, Sweetie!
- Am now reprogramming.

01:05:21.724 --> 01:05:24.483
Please deliver first
voice command override code.

01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:26.283
I love you.

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:28.603
I've always known that, Benjamin.

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.882
Please deliversecond
voice command override code.

01:05:34.842 --> 01:05:38.082
Benjamin, voice command
override sequence is incomplete!

01:05:38.243 --> 01:05:41.882
You must deliver the secondpass code
before I can help you.

01:05:42.962 --> 01:05:44.881
Benjamin, please.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.760
I am unable to contact him foryou,
Dr Evers.

01:06:04.841 --> 01:06:07.680
Navigator Sotomejor- Benjamin.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.959
Benjamin is dead!

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.799
Do you read me? Nick, come in!

01:06:18.919 --> 01:06:20.879
Can you hear me? Nick, come in.

01:06:36.998 --> 01:06:38.917
You still don't recognise me.

01:06:41.757 --> 01:06:43.676
It's me.

01:06:44.837 --> 01:06:46.476
It's Karl.

01:06:49.117 --> 01:06:51.036
It's Karl!

01:06:52.756 --> 01:06:56.715
I didn't send you that distress call
cos I wanted you to rescue me.

01:06:56.876 --> 01:06:58.915
I sent it because I wanted to rescue you.

01:06:59.076 --> 01:07:00.995
You have to try and listen to me.

01:07:02.436 --> 01:07:04.355
I am listening.

01:07:06.595 --> 01:07:09.155
Karl, this thing is changing you.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:12.234
It has changed me.

01:07:13.635 --> 01:07:15.554
In the most amazing ways.

01:07:22.674 --> 01:07:24.553
Why do you want to hurt me?

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:27.753
I would never hurt you.

01:07:27.914 --> 01:07:29.833
Don't you know that?

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:34.472
That's all in the past. I promise.

01:07:34.633 --> 01:07:37.392
I promise. OK?

01:07:40.872 --> 01:07:42.512
I'm different now.

01:07:43.193 --> 01:07:45.792
I'm still made of all the same things.

01:07:45.952 --> 01:07:47.871
Calcium, iron, zinc.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:51.311
All the elements.

01:07:51.472 --> 01:07:54.552
The elements created
by the stars when they die.

01:07:56.912 --> 01:07:59.751
It's all stardust - all of it!

01:08:00.871 --> 01:08:02.790
Even us.

01:08:04.631 --> 01:08:07.271
Stars die so that we can live

01:08:08.271 --> 01:08:11.630
and we die so that stars can be reborn.

01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:17.470
I'm more a part of everything now,
not less. Can't you see that?

01:08:17.629 --> 01:08:19.309
I'm the next step!

01:08:20.549 --> 01:08:22.868
The next leap! It's evolution!

01:08:23.029 --> 01:08:24.988
I want you to take it with me, Kaela.

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:27.749
Just say yes. Just say yes!

01:08:27.908 --> 01:08:30.468
Who knows what we'll be capable of?

01:08:30.589 --> 01:08:32.228
Who knows

01:08:32.389 --> 01:08:33.988
how long we may live?

01:08:34.148 --> 01:08:36.147
I give you about ten minutes.

01:08:36.308 --> 01:08:37.667
- Nick!
- Quiet!

01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:39.587
Rescue return transpor

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:42.667
emergency arrival
sequence commencing.

01:08:46.508 --> 01:08:50.268
- Didn't realise you had an RRT on board.
- Let me ask you something.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:54.107
That thing - did it make you this way,
or were you born so stupid?

01:08:54.267 --> 01:08:56.586
That's pretty funny, Nick!

01:08:58.225 --> 01:09:01.185
Specially since I'm sitting
in your captain's chair!

01:09:02.106 --> 01:09:04.024
You don't get it, do you, Karl?

01:09:04.185 --> 01:09:08.506
All your lies and tricks, and all you've
done is trapped yourself on the ship.

01:09:08.665 --> 01:09:11.865
Without a functioning D-drive,
without any fuel,

01:09:12.026 --> 01:09:14.505
you and your toy aren't going anywhere.

01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:16.865
What's the matter with you, Karl?

01:09:17.024 --> 01:09:19.425
You're not thinking.

01:09:20.904 --> 01:09:23.184
I'm comin' for you, Karl.

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:30.024
Rescue return transpor
5,000 metres, closing.

01:09:30.184 --> 01:09:32.103
You stay here.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:43.582
Rescue return transpor
3,000 metres, closing.

01:09:56.702 --> 01:10:00.462
Sweetie, activate automatic
docking procedures in the cargo bay!

01:10:00.622 --> 01:10:02.701
Cargo bay is now ready for docking.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.740
Docking complete. Opening airlock.

01:10:46.018 --> 01:10:47.817
Are you ready, Karl?

01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:26.369
- Where are the others?
- There's nobody left.

01:12:57.768 --> 01:13:02.087
Ninth-dimensional isotopic matter
with an exponential expansion capability?

01:13:02.247 --> 01:13:03.967
This cannot get back home.

01:13:04.127 --> 01:13:07.845
And Karl - he's mutating, adapting.
Getting younger and stronger.

01:13:13.366 --> 01:13:15.206
Sweetie, locate patient.

01:13:15.367 --> 01:13:19.406
- Patient is located in cargo cage three.
- Chances of patient escaping?

01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:21.285
Chances

01:13:22.166 --> 01:13:23.645
very good.

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:34.164
Warning. Ninth-dimensional matter
is becoming increasingly unstable.

01:13:36.004 --> 01:13:38.603
We've got to get Karl
to the observation dome.

01:13:38.764 --> 01:13:41.723
Give him a little surprise
I brought back for him.

01:14:14.202 --> 01:14:17.441
Attention. Dimension drive
recharge is now complete.

01:14:17.601 --> 01:14:21.200
Time to emergencyjump activation:
ten minutes and counting.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.839
Attention. Extensive damage to
dimensional stabilisation chamber.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.200
Dimensional stabilisation units
two, three, four,

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.479
five, six and seven now inoperable.

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:52.479
Time to dimensionjump:
nine minutes, counting.

01:14:59.718 --> 01:15:02.437
Locate object removed
from quarantine bay.

01:15:28.995 --> 01:15:33.154
- We detonate this thing, chances are...
- Either way, it doesn't get back home.

01:15:37.395 --> 01:15:39.314
Almost.

01:15:41.914 --> 01:15:43.393
Almost...

01:15:52.313 --> 01:15:54.072
Say goodbye, Karl!

01:16:12.352 --> 01:16:14.632
Warning. Extreme atmospheric loss.

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.711
All crew, evacuate area.

01:16:17.432 --> 01:16:20.672
Midship corridorairlocks
will seal in 20 seconds.

01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:22.750
Danger. All crew, evacuate area.

01:16:31.991 --> 01:16:34.390
Two minutes to
dimensionjump activation.

01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:41.510
Dimensional stabilisation
chamber sterilising.

01:16:44.589 --> 01:16:49.749
Warning. Ninth-dimensional matteris now
responding to gravity ofblue giant sun.

01:16:50.989 --> 01:16:55.788
A ninth-dimensional reaction would
spread in all directions in the universe.

01:16:55.948 --> 01:16:58.947
- Specify.
- The reaction would continue.

01:16:59.108 --> 01:17:03.148
The resulting supernova would
likely reach Earh in 51 years.

01:17:03.308 --> 01:17:05.507
lt could either destroy life on Earh

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:09.226
or enable humankind to achieve
a new level ofexistence.

01:17:09.988 --> 01:17:13.387
There's just the one DSU left,
so I'm staying and you're going.

01:17:13.387 --> 01:17:14.306
No.

01:17:14.428 --> 01:17:16.147
- Yes.
- We can go together.

01:17:16.307 --> 01:17:20.466
I'm staying with you - or you get in this
DSU with me and we take our chances.

01:17:20.626 --> 01:17:24.026
So either we both die or we end up
a genetic experiment gone bad?

01:17:24.186 --> 01:17:26.546
We'll see. Your choice - inside or out?

01:17:28.066 --> 01:17:30.186
This is crazy.

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:32.185
I appreciate that fact!

01:17:32.346 --> 01:17:35.625
Attention. One minute to
dimensionjump activation.

01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:43.344
- I can think of worse ways to die.
- Don't be so negative.

01:17:43.505 --> 01:17:47.344
Before all the trouble started
I thought this was all you had in mind!

01:17:47.504 --> 01:17:51.063
Given the circumstances, I'm afraid
my performance will be lacking.

01:17:51.224 --> 01:17:54.864
Danger. Ninth-dimensional matter
now reaching critical mass.

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:58.743
- Oh, no.
- Ten, nine, eight.

01:18:02.223 --> 01:18:05.822
Four, three, two, one.

01:18:40.821 --> 01:18:42.540
Dimensionjump complete.

01:18:43.581 --> 01:18:46.940
Dimensional stabilisation
chamber now sterilising.

01:18:52.579 --> 01:18:55.898
Please note: body proximity
during dimensionjump

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.459
has resulted in
a two per cent transfer

01:18:58.619 --> 01:19:00.299
ofgenetic material.

01:19:04.898 --> 01:19:06.817
Are my eyes...?

01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:14.018
Post-dimensionjump profile.

01:19:14.177 --> 01:19:16.977
Cardiovascular condition: excellent.

01:19:17.138 --> 01:19:19.297
Blood analysis: normal.

01:19:19.457 --> 01:19:21.616
Nervous system response: optimal.

01:19:23.377 --> 01:19:25.777
And, Kaela, there's something else.

01:19:25.937 --> 01:19:28.696
- Yes, Sweetie?
- You're going to have a child.

01:19:30.617 --> 01:19:32.536
A girl.

01:19:32.696 --> 01:19:34.615
Congratulations.

01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:37.335
And welcome home.
