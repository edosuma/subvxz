WEBVTT

00:04.096 --> 00:05.726
Come on, dude, 
one more round.

00:05.846 --> 00:06.896
Nope, I can't.

00:07.016 --> 00:10.263
We don't have to do 18.
We can do nine, easy course, par three.

00:10.383 --> 00:12.046
Nope, Katie's expecting me.

00:12.166 --> 00:14.479
Well, be late.
Women like it when guys are late.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.888
No, they don't, and I can't be late.
Not for this lunch.

00:17.008 --> 00:18.778
- Why's that?
- Can you keep a secret?

00:18.898 --> 00:20.142
- No.
- Right.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.367
I got this...

00:23.641 --> 00:25.080
on my last trip to Earth.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.251
I feel it's time that Katie and I move
the relationship to the next level, so.

00:28.371 --> 00:30.132
- Second base?
- No. Marriage.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.460
- Really? You?
- Yes. Yes.

00:32.580 --> 00:33.577
Married?

00:33.697 --> 00:35.838
You don't think I'm ready?
You think I'm rushing things?

00:35.958 --> 00:37.760
- I didn't say that.
- Well, I'm not...

00:37.880 --> 00:40.167
- ready to set a date or anything, but--
- Is this a diamond?

00:40.287 --> 00:41.419
<i>Eighth of a carat.</i>

00:41.579 --> 00:43.463
Conflict free,
and I got a good deal, actually.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.256
I'm sure you did.

00:45.416 --> 00:46.660
All right, so...

00:47.249 --> 00:48.399
here I go.

00:48.942 --> 00:52.010
Well, I'll buy you a beer later,
we can celebrate.

00:52.130 --> 00:54.015
Yeah, or drown my sorrows,
should she say no.

00:54.175 --> 00:55.558
No, no. None of that.

00:59.431 --> 01:00.563
Well, go get the girl.

01:05.610 --> 01:07.173
- Rodney...
- Can't talk.

01:09.610 --> 01:10.610
John.

01:11.424 --> 01:12.867
Do you have a moment to talk?

01:13.788 --> 01:15.303
Another sparring accident?

01:15.423 --> 01:17.427
Actually, I slipped in the shower.

01:17.547 --> 01:19.956
- Oh, really?
- Nah. Sparring accident.

01:21.066 --> 01:24.171
This is the third time this week
I've had to patch you up.

01:24.820 --> 01:25.847
You know,

01:25.967 --> 01:28.915
there are a lot of other ways
you can spend your free time.

01:29.395 --> 01:31.105
Not as much fun, though.

01:34.452 --> 01:36.397
- Hi, Colonel.
- Doctor, where are you headed?

01:36.517 --> 01:38.805
- Control room.
- Ooh, me too. We can share.

01:38.925 --> 01:39.955
Splendid.

01:41.796 --> 01:43.485
- Katie?
- I'm in here!

01:43.605 --> 01:45.202
Great. Awesome.

01:45.668 --> 01:47.677
<i>- Hope you're hungry.</i>
- Oh, I am.

01:47.797 --> 01:49.112
<i>Yeah, me too, very hungry.</i>

01:49.779 --> 01:51.296
Hungry, hungry, hungry.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.199
Are you all right?

01:53.848 --> 01:54.889
I'm fine.

01:55.423 --> 01:56.218
Yeah.

01:56.338 --> 01:57.579
Wow, this is much more...

01:59.414 --> 02:01.124
- You're sweating.
- Oh, am I?

02:01.633 --> 02:03.738
I suppose I am. Okay...

02:04.049 --> 02:06.629
I guess I should...
jump right into this.

02:07.184 --> 02:08.991
You know, rip the band-aid off,
as they say.

02:09.112 --> 02:11.968
Not that this is painful in any way.
It's quite the opposite, actually.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.511
Rodney, what's wrong?

02:13.671 --> 02:15.997
It's nothing.
In fact, everything's right...

02:16.533 --> 02:17.515
with us, I mean.

02:18.091 --> 02:21.644
So I was thinking... and I don't know
about you, but the way I see it,

02:22.217 --> 02:23.724
I thought that maybe...

02:23.844 --> 02:25.106
it's time that we...

02:25.614 --> 02:27.066
you know, start

02:27.226 --> 02:28.964
entertaining the notion...

02:46.360 --> 02:47.977
Why'd the doors close?

02:48.621 --> 02:49.552
Rodney,

02:49.672 --> 02:51.127
what's going on?

02:51.653 --> 02:52.799
It's locked.

02:53.526 --> 02:55.087
We're trapped.

We're locked in.

04:09.973 --> 04:11.457
Rodney, come in.

04:12.650 --> 04:14.265
This one's locked, too.

04:14.853 --> 04:16.682
What the hell's going on here?

04:17.853 --> 04:20.262
Dr. McKay, this is Dr. Keller.
Are you there?

04:20.423 --> 04:22.526
Rodney, this is Sam, do you read?

04:24.185 --> 04:26.519
The control mechanism
is not responding.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.897
Perhaps I can physically
open the door.

04:30.470 --> 04:34.650
Transporter doors are lighter, not
as heavy as other doors in the City...

04:39.402 --> 04:41.726
Rodney, this is Sam, please respond.

04:42.948 --> 04:44.424
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?

04:44.544 --> 04:46.422
- Are you getting anything?
- No.

04:46.542 --> 04:47.992
Communications must be down.

04:48.112 --> 04:48.949
Oh, great.

04:49.226 --> 04:51.894
All right, I'm going to need a radio.
I left mine in my lab.

04:52.231 --> 04:53.068
Radio?

04:54.049 --> 04:55.602
- In there.
- What do you mean?

04:55.722 --> 04:58.324
- What, you don't have a radio in here?
- It's a plant cultivation room.

04:58.444 --> 05:00.419
- We haven't needed one.
- Well, we need one now.

05:00.539 --> 05:02.668
- That alarm was a quarantine lockdown.
- Quarantine?

05:02.788 --> 05:04.843
Atlantis' self-protection
against another outbreak.

05:04.963 --> 05:07.650
It's sealing off sections of the City
to prevent the spread of a disease.

05:07.770 --> 05:09.218
I... tweaked the...

05:09.338 --> 05:11.272
system after the recent
Kirsan Fever outbreak.

05:11.922 --> 05:13.287
But there was no lockdown

05:13.407 --> 05:15.275
- during that outbreak.
<i>- Well, hence the need</i>

05:15.437 --> 05:17.826
to tweak the system, you know,
institute more vigorous protocols.

05:17.946 --> 05:20.341
I need to get to a computer,
assess the degree of the situation.

05:20.461 --> 05:22.554
Is this just a few sections
that have been sealed off,

05:22.674 --> 05:24.720
or maybe the whole tower...

05:26.894 --> 05:28.770
Computer's in the other room,
isn't it?

05:28.890 --> 05:29.874
With the radio.

05:32.675 --> 05:35.179
There must be another
disease outbreak.

05:36.134 --> 05:38.441
McKay said he was going to
modify the quarantine system

05:38.561 --> 05:40.360
to make it more efficient.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.795
How does cutting off the radios
make it more efficient?

05:42.915 --> 05:45.598
Obviously there's
a glitch in the program.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.874
Problem is, without communications, he
can't tell me how bad the outbreak is,

05:49.994 --> 05:51.577
or give me the passcodes to

05:51.697 --> 05:53.825
open whichever doors are deemed safe.

05:53.945 --> 05:54.945
Ah. Great.

05:57.445 --> 05:59.604
Well, in any case, I should be
ready to treat the sick

05:59.724 --> 06:01.498
when they bring them in.
Will you help me?

06:01.618 --> 06:02.907
Tell me what to do.

06:03.245 --> 06:06.455
I could really use Ronon's gun
right about now.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.178
<i>John, look.</i>

06:08.515 --> 06:09.315
What?

06:09.945 --> 06:12.558
It appears there's been
another outbreak.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.175
What is a category five?

06:17.756 --> 06:21.175
I'm guessing it's a lot worse
than categories one through four.

06:22.293 --> 06:24.093
We could be here a while.

06:28.832 --> 06:29.632
What?

06:30.105 --> 06:32.594
It's just that every time one of these
things happens in the movies,

06:32.714 --> 06:34.495
the pregnant woman goes into labor.

06:34.615 --> 06:36.242
I am still a long way from my due date.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.645
Yeah, it's the same thing in the movies,
and then... wham!

06:38.765 --> 06:40.095
Relax, John. I will be fine.

06:40.215 --> 06:41.974
- Why don't you sit down?
- I am all right.

06:42.094 --> 06:45.199
You know, just to be on the safe side...
Let's sit down.

06:45.654 --> 06:47.956
<i>Let's see what else we can find out.</i>

06:51.176 --> 06:52.676
Quarantine lockdown.

06:54.044 --> 06:54.744
Yes.

06:55.654 --> 06:59.054
Well, I don't know why communications
would be affected.

07:00.130 --> 07:03.291
Rodney did say he was going to
modify some of the Ancient protocols.

07:03.411 --> 07:04.427
<i>He made a mistake,</i>

07:04.895 --> 07:07.597
made the security measures
a little too aggressive?

07:08.583 --> 07:10.981
We need to try to access the mainframe.

07:11.246 --> 07:13.606
Yes, but unfortunately,
that's all you'll be able to do.

07:13.726 --> 07:15.264
This tablet has limited RAM.

07:15.384 --> 07:17.556
It's configured mainly for read-only
field diagnostics.

07:17.676 --> 07:20.296
Well, we should at least be able
to determine the extent of the lockdown.

07:20.416 --> 07:21.693
Yes. Oh, sorry.

07:23.314 --> 07:25.068
That's one of my pigeons.

07:25.373 --> 07:27.328
I raise them, as... as a hobby.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.488
Back home.

07:29.643 --> 07:31.512
Let's see what we have here.

07:36.239 --> 07:39.525
You comfortable? You want anything?
You want to lie down, eat?

07:40.615 --> 07:42.885
This is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

07:43.005 --> 07:43.805
What?

07:44.426 --> 07:47.595
Your decision to remove me
from the team's missions.

07:47.715 --> 07:49.365
We're not gonna go 
through this again.

07:49.485 --> 07:51.557
No, no, no, it's all right.
I understand.

07:51.875 --> 07:54.412
It's not permanent.
You're just going to have to ease off,

07:54.532 --> 07:58.117
then you have your baby, and,
in a few months, you're back in action.

07:58.894 --> 07:59.894
Will I be?

08:01.664 --> 08:04.956
If it is wrong to place myself
and my unborn child in danger now,

08:05.076 --> 08:06.989
will it be any less
to do so when he is born?

08:08.465 --> 08:11.645
John, it's bad enough that my son
may grow up without a father,

08:11.765 --> 08:14.065
but if I were to be hurt or killed,

08:14.804 --> 08:17.241
he would be left without
a mother as well.

08:19.244 --> 08:20.744
It's tough. I know.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.665
A friend from college,

08:22.785 --> 08:24.485
she's a cop. Three kids.

08:25.058 --> 08:28.114
She goes through this every day
when she goes to work.

08:28.234 --> 08:30.634
How does she make 
peace with herself?

08:31.363 --> 08:33.917
Well, she figures
she's fighting bad guys,

08:34.037 --> 08:35.673
keeping them off the streets, so

08:35.793 --> 08:39.457
not only is she protecting her kids,
she's protecting other kids too.

08:42.904 --> 08:43.806
Look...

08:44.475 --> 08:46.097
you have to understand...

08:47.291 --> 08:49.297
your child has a family here,

08:49.706 --> 08:51.701
in case anything ever happens.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.660
Category five?

09:00.780 --> 09:01.874
The entire City?

09:01.994 --> 09:03.574
This disease spreads more rapidly

09:03.694 --> 09:06.415
- than anything I've ever encountered.
- Something's wrong.

09:06.535 --> 09:07.658
Look at the levels.

09:07.778 --> 09:09.884
Primary and secondary systems...

09:10.377 --> 09:12.054
look, wild fluctuations in every sector.

09:12.226 --> 09:14.363
Other systems are down, too,
not just communications.

09:14.483 --> 09:17.661
Long-range scanners are out,
ventilation in several areas,

09:17.781 --> 09:19.386
including this tower.

09:20.676 --> 09:22.532
Oh, oh, and plumbing, too... oh, dear.

09:22.652 --> 09:26.252
It's like the City's entire
operating system is on the fritz.

09:26.776 --> 09:29.599
Oh, this may not even be an outbreak
at all. This entire lockdown

09:29.719 --> 09:31.532
could be the result of a malfunction.

09:32.016 --> 09:34.328
<i>Don't worry, I'm sure McKay is
sitting at a workstation,</i>

09:34.448 --> 09:36.548
<i>fixing this problem as we speak.</i>

09:41.174 --> 09:43.696
I'm sure others are working
on the problem.

09:43.816 --> 09:44.817
Dr. Keller,

09:44.937 --> 09:45.968
Dr. Zelenka,

09:46.663 --> 09:47.734
Colonel Carter...

09:47.854 --> 09:49.258
Oh, they'd better be.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.683
You tore your stitches.

10:04.216 --> 10:06.943
Honestly, I don't think I've ever met
anyone with such reckless aggression.

10:09.225 --> 10:10.876
That's not a compliment.

10:10.996 --> 10:12.196
If you say so.

10:12.615 --> 10:13.616
Lay down.

10:19.323 --> 10:21.427
Okay, look, I don't think
we're going to have any luck

10:21.547 --> 10:23.643
opening those doors on our own.

10:23.845 --> 10:26.849
We're probably just better off waiting
for McKay and the others to

10:26.969 --> 10:29.234
figure out what needs to be done and

10:29.354 --> 10:31.550
which doors are even safe to open.

10:32.184 --> 10:34.679
- We're supposed to sit here and wait?
- Yes.

10:34.906 --> 10:37.106
And be ready at a moment's notice to

10:37.226 --> 10:38.349
treat the sick.

10:39.315 --> 10:41.717
I'm not very good
at sitting and waiting.

10:41.837 --> 10:42.937
No kidding.

10:44.364 --> 10:46.232
Well, maybe we could pass the time by

10:46.455 --> 10:48.150
getting to know each other better.

10:51.414 --> 10:52.697
What do you have in mind?

10:54.884 --> 10:56.204
Oh! I... I mean, I didn't...

10:56.324 --> 10:58.622
You know, I meant just, like, talk.

10:59.174 --> 11:00.246
I didn't mean...

11:02.658 --> 11:04.359
Yeah, so, anyway...

11:06.615 --> 11:07.721
Let's talk.

11:20.133 --> 11:22.310
Can't you fiddle with this thing
and get the door open?

11:22.557 --> 11:23.982
I could fiddle with it, sure.

11:24.102 --> 11:26.139
As to actually getting
the door open, not a chance.

11:26.259 --> 11:29.423
The quarantine protocol completely
disables the doors' control mechanisms.

11:29.543 --> 11:31.986
The whole point of it is
to keep people from getting out.

11:32.146 --> 11:33.726
Oh, it's going to be okay.

11:33.846 --> 11:36.188
- Dr. Keller and Zelenka...
- We don't know that.

11:36.308 --> 11:38.034
We have no idea
if it's going to be okay.

11:38.154 --> 11:40.748
For all we know, Zelenka and Keller
could already be infected.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.295
We don't even know how much
of the City is in quarantine.

11:43.415 --> 11:45.546
This is serious, we have
no reason to believe otherwise,

11:45.666 --> 11:49.135
- we look at a City-wide lockdown.
- You're thinking in the worst-case.

11:49.255 --> 11:51.716
Hello! This is what I do.
Someone needs to think ahead

11:51.836 --> 11:54.967
to the worst possible situation
in order to properly defend against it.

11:55.087 --> 11:56.927
Any situation?
Even the good ones?

11:57.115 --> 11:58.523
Hey, it doesn't take much for a

11:58.643 --> 12:00.139
good situation to turn ugly.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.046
One minute, you're happily riding
your bicycle back from

12:03.166 --> 12:05.375
acing your Lagrangian mechanics
mid-term, you know, the

12:05.495 --> 12:08.388
warm breeze in your face, and next,
you're flying 'cause you hit a pothole.

12:08.508 --> 12:10.569
Oh, Rodney, did that happen to you?

12:10.689 --> 12:13.546
The point is, one must
always be on guard,

12:13.666 --> 12:15.695
always looking out for the potholes.
Now, you can

12:15.815 --> 12:17.446
call me a catastrophist, but it's a...

12:17.566 --> 12:19.263
it's a necessary burden I bear.

12:20.402 --> 12:21.554
A mindset like that,

12:21.674 --> 12:25.369
<i>and a person would live in a
constant state of worry and fear.</i>

12:27.860 --> 12:29.364
You forgot despair.

12:32.722 --> 12:34.735
Well, it's definitely a malfunction,

12:34.855 --> 12:37.225
and surprisingly,
it's nothing Rodney did.

12:37.345 --> 12:39.939
Look at that. I'm reading
a sudden spike in power caused by

12:40.059 --> 12:42.811
an intense ionospheric
storm earlier today.

12:43.781 --> 12:45.851
This new planet continues
to surprise us.

12:46.442 --> 12:48.462
It is going to require
some drastic recalibration to

12:48.582 --> 12:50.481
account for any future
ionospheric activity.

12:50.784 --> 12:53.097
Well, first things first.
We need to get to a workstation

12:53.217 --> 12:56.221
- and fix this malfunction.
- Yes. I agree.

12:58.482 --> 13:02.216
I'm a little bit puzzled as to why
Rodney hasn't solved this problem yet.

13:02.336 --> 13:04.135
He's been a little off his game lately.

13:04.255 --> 13:06.445
Maybe he doesn't have
access to a computer.

13:06.565 --> 13:08.571
Rodney? Without his computer?

13:08.865 --> 13:11.754
- This I have yet to witness.
- Well, whatever the cause,

13:11.931 --> 13:13.921
since there's no outbreak,
there's no reason

13:14.081 --> 13:15.589
to be stuck in here.

13:15.816 --> 13:18.571
Well, yes, other than the doors
being sealed shut.

13:19.746 --> 13:21.554
And heavier than we had
previously thought.

13:21.714 --> 13:24.917
Can you use this tablet
to access this control panel?

13:25.445 --> 13:27.745
Maybe we can at least figure out
a way to get the doors open.

13:27.865 --> 13:31.372
Doubtful. The transporter panel has
no wireless interface, and

13:31.492 --> 13:34.066
even if we could hook it up directly,
with the limitations of the RAM

13:34.226 --> 13:36.126
- on this tablet...
- May I?

13:36.343 --> 13:38.571
- Thanks.
- Yes. Of course.

13:39.237 --> 13:40.876
Well, lifesigns all over the City.

13:40.996 --> 13:42.783
Everyone is trapped as we are.

13:42.943 --> 13:46.443
Ventilation is down, which means
we're running out of air.

13:50.862 --> 13:52.209
He's in the botany lab.

13:52.369 --> 13:53.469
- Who?
- Rodney.

13:53.589 --> 13:56.139
He went to pick up
Katie Brown for a lunch date.

13:56.259 --> 13:57.784
Have you been in that plant room?

13:57.904 --> 14:00.384
- There's no computers, no radio...
- If he's locked in there...

14:00.544 --> 14:02.344
He's going to be freaking.

14:09.732 --> 14:10.853
Are you all right?

14:11.208 --> 14:12.819
I don't know. I feel...

14:12.939 --> 14:14.138
a little dizzy,

14:14.258 --> 14:15.551
a little feverish.

14:15.671 --> 14:16.484
Here.

14:18.995 --> 14:20.909
Rodney, come on, sit down.

14:27.738 --> 14:28.913
You don't feel warm.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.588
Are you sure?
'Cause...

14:32.726 --> 14:35.692
my joints ache.
It's usually the first sign of a fever.

14:37.368 --> 14:38.356
Pulse...

14:38.753 --> 14:39.548
120?

14:39.918 --> 14:41.148
That's normal.

14:41.695 --> 14:43.245
I've always had a rapid heartbeat.

14:44.066 --> 14:46.455
Ever since I was a kid. I mean,
even when I was in a deep sleep.

14:46.575 --> 14:49.218
Our family doctor once
wrote a paper about it.

14:51.054 --> 14:52.450
How are you feeling?

14:53.260 --> 14:54.208
I'm fine.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.817
Okay, well, you let me know
when you start feeling sick, all right?

14:59.379 --> 15:01.735
It seems as though
there was some kind of disturbance

15:01.855 --> 15:04.117
in the planet's ionosphere
a few hours ago.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.062
After that is
when the system became unstable.

15:07.182 --> 15:08.997
New planet, new problems.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.330
Well, there may not even
be a disease outbreak.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.171
Yeah, and the City's still on lockdown.

15:13.291 --> 15:16.459
If Rodney can't get ahold of a computer,
he's not gonna be able to shut it down.

15:16.579 --> 15:19.197
Perhaps Dr. Zelenka
or Colonel Carter can do it.

15:19.317 --> 15:21.165
If they could've,
they'd have done it already.

15:21.285 --> 15:23.077
They probably can't
get ahold of one either.

15:23.197 --> 15:24.344
Can anyone do it?

15:24.464 --> 15:26.599
They'd have to know Rodney's password.

15:28.023 --> 15:29.245
<i>Fortunately...</i>

15:29.852 --> 15:30.662
<i>I do.</i>

15:31.462 --> 15:34.807
- He told you his password?
- Well, he didn't think I'd remember it.

15:35.736 --> 15:37.893
1... 6... 4... 3...

15:38.013 --> 15:39.428
1... 8... 7... 9...

15:39.548 --> 15:40.926
1... 9... 6... 8...

15:41.046 --> 15:41.858
4... 2.

15:42.768 --> 15:44.071
See? Doesn't take a genius.

15:44.676 --> 15:45.684
It doesn't?

15:45.804 --> 15:48.357
1643 is the year Isaac Newton was born.

15:48.477 --> 15:51.220
1879, Einstein, and 1968...

15:51.340 --> 15:52.901
The year Rodney was born.

15:53.021 --> 15:55.541
Never underestimate
the size of that man's ego.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.334
Wait. Weren't there other numbers?

15:57.638 --> 15:58.345
42.

15:58.662 --> 16:00.853
- What is that?
- It's the ultimate answer

16:00.973 --> 16:03.807
to the great question
of life, the universe, and everything.

16:04.785 --> 16:05.514
Okay.

16:06.708 --> 16:07.639
We're in.

16:12.228 --> 16:13.815
Oh, that's a good idea.

16:19.129 --> 16:20.323
Okay, much better.

16:20.443 --> 16:22.336
Yes. Much better.

16:24.564 --> 16:26.513
The control panel
won't recognize authentication.

16:26.633 --> 16:28.574
Because it's not configured,
as I said earlier...

16:28.694 --> 16:30.866
I know, which is why
I've written a workaround to free up

16:30.986 --> 16:32.809
memory to allow for local device input.

16:32.929 --> 16:33.662
So fast?

16:33.822 --> 16:36.262
Well, there's obviously not enough RAM
to handle the City's entire

16:36.382 --> 16:39.267
operating system, but we should at least
be able to open these doors.

16:39.387 --> 16:42.421
All I need to do is get it to recognize
the authentication command.

16:42.581 --> 16:45.215
Perhaps if you bypassed the secondary
crystals and go directly...

16:45.542 --> 16:47.272
No... God, Radek!

16:50.840 --> 16:52.185
They didn't open.

16:52.366 --> 16:53.142
No.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.667
And the tablet's fried.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.605
Oh, crap.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.627
What is it?

17:05.486 --> 17:08.851
Part of the lockdown program
includes broadcasting an alert beacon

17:08.971 --> 17:12.223
to approaching ships
to warn them about a disease outbreak.

17:12.344 --> 17:13.819
The City is doing this right now?

17:13.940 --> 17:16.631
Five by five, clear enough
for the entire neighborhood to pick up.

17:16.751 --> 17:18.582
- Can you shut it off?
- Not from here.

17:18.742 --> 17:20.896
It can only be turned off
from the subspace transmitter,

17:21.016 --> 17:23.028
which is up in the control room,
which means

17:23.147 --> 17:25.713
the guys upstairs either
haven't noticed it, or, more likely,

17:25.833 --> 17:27.715
don't have
Rodney's password to turn it off.

17:28.098 --> 17:31.760
As long as that signal is broadcast,
Atlantis is vulnerable to discovery.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.755
If it hasn't already happened.

17:40.044 --> 17:41.184
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

17:41.304 --> 17:42.363
<i>The same.</i>

17:44.452 --> 17:45.164
Hey.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.642
You look like
you could use some cheering up.

17:48.762 --> 17:50.489
As a matter of fact, I could.

17:59.219 --> 18:00.290
What is it?

18:01.746 --> 18:02.902
It's nothing.

18:04.235 --> 18:05.671
Oh, hey, isn't that the...

18:07.607 --> 18:09.177
The Rodneyana Villosa?

18:09.297 --> 18:10.686
The plant I named for you.

18:10.806 --> 18:11.600
Right.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.180
It's grown.

18:14.736 --> 18:16.999
Yes, it's really flourished here.

18:17.637 --> 18:20.893
I've... I've been kind of doting on it,
giving it a little extra TLC,

18:21.013 --> 18:22.148
and it just...

18:22.268 --> 18:23.691
just gets bigger and...

18:24.627 --> 18:25.583
bigger...

18:31.081 --> 18:33.824
- We need to get you to the infirmary.
- I already told you, it's impossible.

18:33.944 --> 18:36.866
Look, the whole point of the lockdown
is to prevent the spread of the disease,

18:36.986 --> 18:39.746
- which means no one's going anywhere.
- But how are the doctors supposed to

18:39.866 --> 18:41.999
treat anyone if they can't reach them?

18:42.564 --> 18:43.857
I'm sorry, Katie.

18:45.316 --> 18:47.671
Look, I've...
no doubt infected you by now.

18:48.092 --> 18:49.463
But I feel fine.

18:49.583 --> 18:52.426
- I'd have at least a few symptoms.
- Every disease is different.

18:52.586 --> 18:54.901
We have no idea what the incubation
period for this strain is.

18:55.021 --> 18:58.182
It could be hours, it could be days.
I mean, who knows when I caught it?

18:58.302 --> 19:01.685
No, it's just a matter of time
before you succumb too.

19:04.722 --> 19:05.588
Anyway...

19:05.708 --> 19:07.469
what were we talking about?

19:08.896 --> 19:10.360
You were going to cheer me up.

19:10.676 --> 19:11.698
Oh. Right.

19:24.639 --> 19:25.866
Are you okay?

19:26.547 --> 19:27.340
Yeah.

19:29.331 --> 19:30.267
I just...

19:31.117 --> 19:33.258
I don't like sitting around either.

19:36.313 --> 19:38.933
Especially
when there's people out there who...

19:39.053 --> 19:39.993
need me.

19:44.407 --> 19:45.813
You're not letting them down.

19:47.772 --> 19:49.513
There's a disease outbreak.

19:49.942 --> 19:51.672
And I'm a doctor,

19:51.792 --> 19:53.695
- stuck in this room...
- That's right.

19:54.059 --> 19:54.904
Stuck.

19:55.956 --> 19:58.418
It's not your fault
you can't get to them.

19:58.538 --> 20:00.661
So don't put the blame on yourself.

20:07.446 --> 20:09.918
You remind me of someone I used to know.

20:11.584 --> 20:14.007
She put way too much
pressure on herself.

20:18.189 --> 20:19.461
Someone from...

20:20.335 --> 20:21.258
Sateda?

20:23.180 --> 20:23.887
Yeah.

20:27.946 --> 20:29.230
Who was she?

20:30.751 --> 20:32.760
She... she was someone I cared about.

20:35.305 --> 20:37.295
She was killed during the siege.

20:42.243 --> 20:43.328
I'm sorry.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.717
I wanted her to leave,

20:47.305 --> 20:49.585
but she chose to stay behind
and help the others.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.440
Should've forced her to go.

21:02.034 --> 21:03.736
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

21:04.426 --> 21:06.043
She chose to stay.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.231
Don't put that blame on yourself.

21:14.590 --> 21:15.339
No.

21:18.893 --> 21:19.914
Come on.

21:20.034 --> 21:21.469
<i>Nothing's working.</i>

21:22.223 --> 21:24.027
Okay, on to plan "B".

21:24.364 --> 21:25.164
<i>Which is?</i>

21:25.284 --> 21:27.497
Which is blast our way outta here

21:27.658 --> 21:29.207
<i>and get to the control room.</i>

21:29.746 --> 21:32.187
Start searching for any explosives
Rodney might've left.

21:32.307 --> 21:34.588
Well, I doubt that he would...

21:39.611 --> 21:42.387
- Don't tell me that you're...
- The baby just kicked.

21:42.795 --> 21:43.646
Really?

21:44.299 --> 21:46.015
There it is again. Here.

21:51.627 --> 21:54.521
Little guy wants to get
out of here as much as we do.

21:59.348 --> 22:00.447
Teyla? You okay?

22:03.440 --> 22:06.603
Just hang in there. I'm going to get
everybody out of here.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.458
- You stand back.
- What are you...

22:22.334 --> 22:24.004
John, what are you doing?

22:24.453 --> 22:26.222
The control room is only
4 floors above us.

22:26.342 --> 22:28.058
All I have to do is climb up,
and I'm in.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.536
Climb the tower?

22:29.656 --> 22:31.214
Is that even possible?

22:31.429 --> 22:33.833
Sure! Batman did it all the time.

22:37.169 --> 22:38.276
Piece of cake.

22:39.402 --> 22:41.135
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.

22:41.717 --> 22:43.532
I'll turn off that beacon.

23:24.205 --> 23:27.405
I'm sorry, I honestly thought that
if we bypassed the secondary crystal...

23:27.525 --> 23:30.952
Radek, I know, we've been through this.
I'm not angry with you.

23:37.006 --> 23:39.546
We could really use
one of your pigeons around now.

23:40.172 --> 23:43.131
- Well, they're not for eating.
- No, no, I meant, you know,

23:43.251 --> 23:44.259
to get help.

23:45.879 --> 23:47.484
Like homing pigeons.

23:47.604 --> 23:50.992
You attach a little SOS note
to their feet, and "boop!"

23:51.112 --> 23:53.625
- Yeah, but there's no window in here.
- I know, I was just...

25:20.991 --> 25:24.048
Okay, I got ventilation
restored to most of the tower.

25:24.168 --> 25:28.029
Still working on getting air up here,
but so far nothing's responding.

25:30.399 --> 25:33.118
- Colonel! How did you get out there?
- Long story.

25:33.238 --> 25:35.767
We've got to turn off the beacon
that's broadcasting our location

25:35.887 --> 25:38.165
- to every ship in the neighborhood.
- We already tried that.

25:38.325 --> 25:41.001
<i>- It's password protected.
- What happened?</i>

25:41.976 --> 25:44.355
<i>Colonel, where the hell
did you come from?</i>

25:44.475 --> 25:45.656
<i>Beacon's deactivated.</i>

25:55.165 --> 25:57.452
The computers just shut down.
All of them.

25:57.572 --> 25:59.728
- Is that the...
- Self-destruct.

26:05.978 --> 26:09.204
- That's the self-destruct sequence!
- Why would anybody arm it?

26:09.324 --> 26:11.092
More importantly,
how much time do we have?

26:11.212 --> 26:13.820
I don't know,
whoever arms it designates the duration,

26:13.940 --> 26:16.009
you know,
depending on how quick he wants to...

26:16.129 --> 26:17.371
blow up the City.

26:19.532 --> 26:20.896
The hell with this.

26:21.385 --> 26:22.287
<i>Ronon...</i>

26:24.285 --> 26:27.750
<i>Ronon! We've already tried.
It's not going to open.</i>

26:27.870 --> 26:29.623
We'll just have to blast a hole in it.

26:29.743 --> 26:32.469
<i>- With what? You don't have your gun.</i>
- You got any C-4 in here?

26:32.852 --> 26:34.179
In the infirmary?

26:34.512 --> 26:37.349
Anything we could use
to act as an explosive?

26:37.509 --> 26:39.121
I don't know...

26:40.955 --> 26:42.742
the oxygen tanks, maybe?

26:43.469 --> 26:44.461
Right!

26:44.581 --> 26:48.052
Shoot 'em like Sheriff Brody did...
in the movie Jaws.

26:50.673 --> 26:53.278
Yeah, I know, I've seen it.
How do you...

26:53.957 --> 26:56.464
Sheppard showed it to me.
It's a good movie.

26:57.330 --> 26:58.352
Flammable.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.402
All right.
All we need is a gun to shoot it with.

27:01.522 --> 27:02.730
You got one in here?

27:02.850 --> 27:04.937
Again, infirmary, not armory.

27:06.079 --> 27:08.695
I don't get it.
Why would you arm the self-destruct?

27:08.815 --> 27:09.903
I didn't.

27:12.027 --> 27:13.809
Finally.
You shut it down?

27:13.929 --> 27:15.694
No, just the alarm.

27:16.118 --> 27:18.431
The City actually armed
the self-destruct by itself, Major.

27:18.914 --> 27:19.646
Why?

27:19.959 --> 27:22.435
Last thing I saw on the screen
was a "breach of quarantine" alert.

27:24.546 --> 27:27.765
My coming into the room caused the City
to think the disease has spread.

27:27.885 --> 27:30.162
But you said earlier
that there was no outbreak.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.091
No, there isn't.
The City doesn't know that.

27:32.211 --> 27:34.030
<i>It's all part of
the system-wide malfunction.</i>

27:34.190 --> 27:37.674
The City must think there's a disease,
and now it's out of control...

27:37.794 --> 27:40.078
So blowing up Atlantis
is its final countermeasure.

27:40.646 --> 27:42.891
Did you see how much time was left
on the self-destruct?

27:43.011 --> 27:45.499
No, computers shut down
before I could see.

27:50.357 --> 27:51.324
All right.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.648
If we can't shut it down from here,

27:53.768 --> 27:56.502
- we have to turn it off at the source.
- That's in the main power room.

27:56.622 --> 27:58.262
- 6 levels down.
<i>- We can't get there.</i>

27:58.423 --> 28:01.224
The Jumper room's sealed off, as every
other corridor out of the Gate room.

28:01.494 --> 28:02.973
I'll just have to climb back down.

28:03.093 --> 28:05.708
It's in the center of the tower.
Even if you climbed back down,

28:05.828 --> 28:09.058
you'd still have to get through several
sealed doors before reaching it.

28:09.395 --> 28:10.612
You got any C-4?

28:11.285 --> 28:12.781
Yeah, a little bit.

28:12.901 --> 28:13.971
That's it?

28:14.286 --> 28:15.244
That's it.

28:16.242 --> 28:17.615
You two, with us.

28:19.162 --> 28:20.772
The alarm turned off.

28:21.341 --> 28:23.158
That's a good sign, right?

28:23.432 --> 28:24.596
I don't know.

28:25.698 --> 28:27.603
Maybe someone found
a cure for the disease,

28:27.723 --> 28:29.918
or at least figured out
how to turn off the self-destruct.

28:30.038 --> 28:32.797
Or maybe someone just
figured out how to turn off the alarm.

28:34.014 --> 28:35.480
I have to lie down.

28:36.809 --> 28:37.755
Rodney,

28:37.875 --> 28:39.275
you can't give up.

28:40.302 --> 28:41.556
You have to keep fighting.

28:41.716 --> 28:43.850
<i>I know it looks bleak, but...</i>

28:46.399 --> 28:47.604
What's this?

28:51.864 --> 28:53.000
That's...

28:53.120 --> 28:54.069
when I...

28:54.229 --> 28:55.621
<i>came here today... I was...</i>

28:55.741 --> 28:57.072
<i>I was gonna propose...</i>

28:58.579 --> 29:00.466
ask your hand in marriage...

29:09.902 --> 29:12.462
- This is not gonna work.
- What are you talking about?

29:12.622 --> 29:13.762
This was your idea.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.548
Yeah, after which I immediately said

29:15.709 --> 29:17.592
there was a one-in-a-million
chance it'd work.

29:18.304 --> 29:20.178
Yeah, well... this is that one.

29:20.569 --> 29:22.346
If I cut more
than a millimeter too far...

29:22.466 --> 29:23.723
The tank'll blow. I know.

29:24.204 --> 29:26.174
So just make sure you don't cut too far.

29:26.546 --> 29:28.570
Just score it, like you said.

29:29.629 --> 29:31.564
Okay, look. If you don't do it,
I'm gonna do it.

29:33.142 --> 29:34.601
Come on. Grab this.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.173
Okay. That's it.

30:30.293 --> 30:31.526
I mean, that's...

30:31.646 --> 30:33.502
that's as far as I should go.

30:33.622 --> 30:34.793
All right.

30:35.691 --> 30:36.862
Let's do it.

31:01.032 --> 31:02.482
All right. You ready?

31:03.400 --> 31:04.222
No.

31:15.697 --> 31:16.724
You okay?

31:17.426 --> 31:18.426
Yeah.

31:18.928 --> 31:19.928
All right.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.469
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

31:29.384 --> 31:31.364
It's a lot stronger than a shark.

31:42.350 --> 31:43.884
Fire in the hole.

31:46.526 --> 31:47.762
That was close.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.940
- Hello? Hey!
- Hey!

31:52.060 --> 31:53.414
- We're in here!
- In here!

31:53.926 --> 31:55.100
Do you hear that?

31:55.406 --> 31:57.609
The transporter. Somebody's in there.

31:59.198 --> 32:00.321
Grab a side.

32:09.292 --> 32:11.474
- Colonel. You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

32:11.862 --> 32:13.101
I'm fine too.

32:14.287 --> 32:16.811
There's no outbreak.
It's just a malfunction.

32:16.931 --> 32:17.981
We know.

32:18.101 --> 32:19.649
Rodney disabled the self-destruct?

32:20.069 --> 32:22.611
No, it's still armed,
and I haven't heard from Rodney.

32:22.731 --> 32:24.985
<i>- I need to get to a workstation.</i>
- Computers are down.

32:25.105 --> 32:28.074
We're trying to get to the power room
so we can physically cut the power.

32:28.234 --> 32:31.494
But all the doors are sealed shut.
We just used our last C-4 getting here.

32:31.654 --> 32:34.372
- Does that mean we're still stuck here?
- That's what it looks like it.

32:35.291 --> 32:37.625
How much time is left
on the self-destruct?

32:37.785 --> 32:40.503
- Computers shut down before we see.
- So it could happen any time.

32:44.747 --> 32:45.720
Great.

32:50.789 --> 32:52.898
You were gonna propose to me?

32:54.540 --> 32:55.501
Today?

32:57.611 --> 32:58.405
Well...

32:58.721 --> 33:00.361
I mean, before the...

33:00.481 --> 33:01.816
the lockdown.

33:06.131 --> 33:07.104
So?

33:10.377 --> 33:11.665
Why don't you?

33:14.172 --> 33:15.063
Now?

33:16.592 --> 33:17.874
You want me to propose now?

33:18.948 --> 33:20.877
Don't you want to hear my answer?

33:21.037 --> 33:23.545
Well, it doesn't really matter
anymore, does it?

33:24.603 --> 33:25.715
How can you say that?

33:25.875 --> 33:27.467
We're moments away from our deaths.

33:27.627 --> 33:29.463
Don't talk like that!

33:29.724 --> 33:32.048
There's still a chance someone
could come through this door...

33:32.168 --> 33:34.195
<i>Katie, please, enough already.</i>

33:34.315 --> 33:36.933
As much as I'd love to believe someone's
gonna swoop in and save the day,

33:37.053 --> 33:38.248
the fact that no one has

33:38.368 --> 33:40.629
tells me it's probably not gonna happen.
I'm sorry if that's

33:40.749 --> 33:43.729
bleak and horrible and fatalistic,
but there it is.

33:55.484 --> 33:58.110
- What are we going to do now?
- Well, what can we do?

33:58.478 --> 34:00.540
<i>Does this vent go to the power room?</i>

34:01.699 --> 34:04.814
Yes! Yes, I believe it leads
to the tower's main ventilation flue.

34:04.934 --> 34:07.196
But that system's shut down.
Those vents will be closed off.

34:07.316 --> 34:09.309
Not anymore.
We were able to get it back online

34:09.429 --> 34:12.137
in most of the tower just before
the computers went down.

34:25.425 --> 34:27.031
All right, looks clear...

34:27.956 --> 34:30.577
It's gonna be a tight squeeze, though.
There's no way I can move in here.

34:30.697 --> 34:32.683
- I'll do it.
- No. I'll do it.

34:33.969 --> 34:35.952
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm small enough.

34:36.112 --> 34:39.190
I can crawl through there.
I'll have the power off in no time.

34:40.589 --> 34:41.697
Attaboy.

34:50.487 --> 34:51.310
Ready?

34:51.679 --> 34:52.474
Yeah.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.108
I had you wrong.

35:07.928 --> 35:09.683
When you first came here,

35:11.339 --> 35:13.067
I thought you were weak.

35:14.327 --> 35:15.999
That you didn't belong.

35:20.889 --> 35:22.669
It's the story of my life.

35:27.861 --> 35:29.248
Growing up, I

35:29.368 --> 35:30.715
skipped three grades.

35:31.327 --> 35:33.094
I graduated at 15.

35:35.259 --> 35:38.556
Got my bachelor's degree before
I was even old enough to vote.

35:39.259 --> 35:41.341
I missed out on a lot of things.

35:44.642 --> 35:45.956
Any kind of

35:46.422 --> 35:48.121
social event...

35:50.313 --> 35:51.532
any parties...

35:54.819 --> 35:56.079
and dances...

35:58.655 --> 36:00.616
I don't ever remember a time in my life

36:00.736 --> 36:02.106
where I belonged.

36:07.424 --> 36:08.630
Yeah, well...

36:09.054 --> 36:10.763
blowing up that tank...

36:12.574 --> 36:13.966
you really showed yourself.

36:19.479 --> 36:20.945
But it didn't work.

36:22.068 --> 36:23.726
That's not the point.

36:27.300 --> 36:29.714
<i>"I'll have the power off in no time."</i>

36:35.013 --> 36:36.013
<i>Idiot!</i>

37:40.947 --> 37:42.416
Come on, Radek.

37:42.536 --> 37:43.742
He'll make it.

38:30.194 --> 38:31.256
He did it.

38:51.167 --> 38:52.316
Oh, my God!

38:52.673 --> 38:55.090
They found a cure or figured out
how to override the program.

38:55.210 --> 38:56.969
I don't believe it!
We're going to make it!

38:57.089 --> 38:58.569
We're not going to die!

39:07.204 --> 39:09.141
<i>You crawled the entire way there,</i>

39:09.301 --> 39:11.552
- in those tiny vents?
- I'm surprised he even fit in there.

39:11.672 --> 39:13.834
- Oh, he fit. There's plenty of room.
- Well, not plenty.

39:13.954 --> 39:16.709
He looked like one of those
little hamsters in one of those...

39:16.829 --> 39:20.560
Yes, yes, listen, the important thing is
I was able to shut the power in time.

39:20.966 --> 39:22.989
Did you hear?
McKay thought it was a real outbreak.

39:23.149 --> 39:24.677
He even started getting sick,

39:24.797 --> 39:26.043
thought he was...

39:28.271 --> 39:29.149
Hi.

39:29.269 --> 39:31.539
- You mind if I join you?
- Sure. Go ahead.

39:39.933 --> 39:40.840
What?

39:41.673 --> 39:42.673
Nothing.

39:45.710 --> 39:48.674
Well, it's been several hours now,
and there is no indication

39:48.794 --> 39:51.129
that anyone out there
has picked up our alert beacon.

39:51.249 --> 39:54.088
- I think we're in the clear.
- Should keep an eye out, just in case.

39:54.208 --> 39:55.467
Great work, Radek.

39:55.587 --> 39:57.982
Everyone on this base
owes you a debt of gratitude.

39:58.283 --> 39:59.577
Well, thank you.

40:01.147 --> 40:02.778
McKay would love this.

40:07.646 --> 40:08.550
Katie?

40:10.988 --> 40:12.692
Hello, Rodney.

40:14.268 --> 40:16.244
I see you're feeling better.

40:16.364 --> 40:17.460
Uh. Yes, I...

40:18.021 --> 40:21.230
well, I mean, it was probably
just, you know, an allergic thing.

40:21.350 --> 40:22.271
I'm fine.

40:22.542 --> 40:23.799
And the...

40:23.959 --> 40:26.351
quarantine?
Is it true, there was no outbreak?

40:26.471 --> 40:29.305
No. It was a malfunction.
A planetary anomaly.

40:29.465 --> 40:31.909
Ionospheric disturbance. I've actually

40:32.029 --> 40:34.806
recalibrated the system so
it'll take into effect future activity,

40:34.926 --> 40:36.158
so we should be fine.

40:36.278 --> 40:39.323
Someone said it was Dr. Zelenka that
finally turned off the self-destruct?

40:39.443 --> 40:41.723
Technically, yes, but it was
actually more of a group effort.

40:41.843 --> 40:44.361
But that's not why I came here. I...

40:45.334 --> 40:46.334
Here's the thing.

40:47.506 --> 40:49.520
Over the last year and a half,

40:50.205 --> 40:52.562
I have become aware
that I have certain...

40:53.164 --> 40:55.534
I don't want to use the word "flaws..."

40:56.288 --> 40:57.726
shortcomings, perhaps?

40:58.466 --> 40:59.655
For example...

41:00.701 --> 41:03.047
on occasion, I can be negative...

41:03.369 --> 41:06.589
and... and demanding
and a tad arrogant... but...

41:07.356 --> 41:09.002
I'm also finding that

41:09.122 --> 41:11.477
just being aware of your...

41:12.163 --> 41:13.467
shortcomings

41:13.587 --> 41:15.313
is just the first,

41:15.719 --> 41:18.145
minute step on the road to betterment,

41:18.305 --> 41:20.528
and the real trick seems to be to

41:20.648 --> 41:22.262
actually do something about it.

41:22.382 --> 41:24.276
I know. It's difficult.

41:24.807 --> 41:26.022
The point is,

41:26.684 --> 41:29.115
I came here earlier today
to propose marriage to you,

41:30.247 --> 41:31.904
but after what happened,

41:33.233 --> 41:35.621
I realize that I may
have been rushing things.

41:38.767 --> 41:40.543
I just don't think 
I'm ready for this.

41:42.874 --> 41:43.836
I know.

41:44.987 --> 41:45.756
You do?

41:47.521 --> 41:49.655
I don't think I'm ready, either.

41:53.919 --> 41:55.330
Okay. Good.

41:56.234 --> 41:57.425
That's good.

41:58.525 --> 42:00.736
It's not that my feelings
have changed or diminished...

42:00.856 --> 42:02.857
- No, of course not.
- Just... I mean,

42:04.252 --> 42:07.726
if we got married now,
I would make your life miserable, and...

42:07.846 --> 42:09.864
you are far too good 
a person for that.

42:10.773 --> 42:12.408
Don't be so hard on yourself.

42:13.649 --> 42:15.608
Easier said than done, right?

42:23.182 --> 42:25.296
Okay. So, raincheck on lunch?

42:25.785 --> 42:27.087
Absolutely.

42:30.839 --> 42:31.785
Rodney?

42:35.758 --> 42:37.763
- Bye.
- Right. Bye.
