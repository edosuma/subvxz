00:00.724 --> 00:04.185
<i>Back to
"American Negro Warrior."</i>

00:04.187 --> 00:06.587
<i>When we last left,
Tequan Jackson was stopped</i>

00:06.739 --> 00:10.174
<i>and frisked, tased four times,
and hit with batons.</i>

00:10.176 --> 00:12.743
<i>The question now is,
will Tequan make it back</i>

00:12.745 --> 00:16.714
<i>to the basketball court for
a highly contested game of 21?</i>

00:16.716 --> 00:19.717
- I don't think Tequan gonna make it.
- Tequan is a real ass G.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.119
- He trained in Ferguson.
- I meant make it in life.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.558
Hello brothers, and I mean
that in the literal sense,

00:27.560 --> 00:30.561
as you are both brothers
in the light of the Most High

00:30.563 --> 00:31.996
and from the seed of my loins.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.898
Thanks bruh,
but we don't want no bean pies

00:33.900 --> 00:37.301
or Final Calls, my nig.

00:37.303 --> 00:40.137
- What the [bleep]?
- Oh, good, it still works.

00:40.139 --> 00:42.807
Although I am a member
in good standing

00:42.809 --> 00:45.810
of the Fruit of Jehovah,
this is not a Final Call.

00:45.812 --> 00:49.947
This is the first of many calls
to the place I call "home."

00:49.949 --> 00:51.916
Malik, what is this dude
talking about?

00:51.918 --> 00:53.384
You know I don't speak
Farrakhonics.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.486
From his calm demeanor,
strong disposition,

00:55.488 --> 00:57.888
and sparkling white teeth,
I'd say he's dropping knowledge.

00:57.890 --> 01:00.791
He's a righteous black man who knows
his place in this wicked society.

01:00.793 --> 01:02.460
- We should honor his presence.
- Yes!

01:02.462 --> 01:06.063
From the lips of babes comes
the truth in its purest form.

01:06.065 --> 01:08.099
Man, who the [bleep]
is at the front door,

01:08.101 --> 01:10.534
using all those syllables
and [bleep] up my high?

01:10.536 --> 01:13.971
Oh, shit, you?
Man, what you even doing here?

01:13.973 --> 01:15.806
- You know this dude?
- Man, know him?

01:15.808 --> 01:17.008
We used to swim in this

01:17.009 --> 01:19.543
nigga's nut sacks, remember?
This is Marvin.

01:19.545 --> 01:21.245
Our daddy.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.622
<b>2x07 - "My Father the Zero"</b>

01:27.854 --> 01:29.420
So Dad, how did you end up in prison?

01:29.422 --> 01:31.822
You guys are old enough
to know the truth.

01:31.824 --> 01:34.759
This is a wicked,
racist world we live in.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.628
Your poor father fell
victim to "the man."

01:37.630 --> 01:41.139
<i>There I was, on a righteous
journey to the Piggly Wiggly</i>

01:41.140 --> 01:44.535
<i>to fetch sustenance for you two,
and diapers for Michael.</i>

01:44.537 --> 01:47.304
Whoo!

01:47.306 --> 01:49.607
Goddamn!

01:49.609 --> 01:52.076
- What are you looking at?
- What you looking at?

01:52.078 --> 01:54.612
- Mind your business.
- Uh, you're gonna pay us, right?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.881
Not for a half done job.
You have to complete it.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.682
We, I'm almost done, so...

01:59.752 --> 02:02.219
Oh, shit, the cops!
Quick, put this dope in your purse.

02:02.221 --> 02:04.588
[bleep] that!

02:06.192 --> 02:09.493
Good evening, Officer.
How may I help thee?

02:12.131 --> 02:14.265
They locked me up
for seven long years.

02:14.267 --> 02:17.568
I prayed and prayed
that Montrel, Grover,

02:17.570 --> 02:19.904
and you, Malachi,
would be okay.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.839
Man, nigga,
[bleep] all that ying yang.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.074
What you even doing here?
You want some money?

02:24.076 --> 02:26.377
'Cause if you do,
you can kick rocks.

02:26.379 --> 02:29.413
But not in them Pro-Keds though,
'cause them joints is nice!

02:29.415 --> 02:32.951
Calm that nostril flare, son,
and just know that when I use

02:32.952 --> 02:36.487
the term "lost," I mean it in the
spiritual sense, not the physical.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.556
Well, I say this
in the physical sense...

02:38.558 --> 02:40.591
you can lose this [bleep]
in your mouth.

02:40.593 --> 02:42.693
Hold on, Montrel.
Let's hear our father out.

02:42.695 --> 02:45.262
That ain't my pappy.
That's y'all's daddy.

02:45.264 --> 02:47.531
I'm your father, nigga, damn!

02:47.633 --> 02:50.768
I'm sorry, I lost my temper.
That was the old me.

02:50.770 --> 02:54.271
I've sworn off white drugs,
white meat, and white women.

02:54.273 --> 02:57.942
I'm a new man now,
Marvin Chaka Khan Khaled.

02:57.944 --> 03:01.912
So I must now ask, do I get
another chance with you guys?

03:01.914 --> 03:03.781
Did Biggie give a nigga
one more chance?

03:03.783 --> 03:05.783
- Hell naw.
- I agree with Montrel.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.118
You can't just come in here,
feed us some bullshit,

03:08.120 --> 03:09.820
and expect us to believe you.

03:09.822 --> 03:11.522
Who you think you is, the President?

03:11.524 --> 03:13.424
Didn't you guys hear him?
He didn't just leave.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.926
He was a pawn in the white man's
war against the original man.

03:15.928 --> 03:17.695
Show some respect.
He gave us life.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.131
Thank you, son.
Now where's my room, Marmaduke?

03:25.938 --> 03:28.672
Yo, check this new app I found
called Tugfinder.

03:28.674 --> 03:29.874
Peep game.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.842
<i>These looks like Korean spas.</i>

03:31.844 --> 03:33.744
That's what they want you to
think, but trust me,

03:33.746 --> 03:35.145
they be beatin' nines in the back.

03:35.147 --> 03:36.714
Let's go tomorrow after practice.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.549
I can't,
my dad said I got to get home

03:38.551 --> 03:41.385
- to do my chores and homework.
- Man, forget that clown.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.388
Everybody know illegitimate
bastard kids is the GOAT.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.825
Allen Iverson, T.O.,
Jordan on his last three rings.

03:47.827 --> 03:51.095
Yeah, but kids with both
parents win championships,

03:51.097 --> 03:53.530
like Steph Curry,
Klay Thompson,

03:53.532 --> 03:55.933
and Jordan on his first three rings.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.102
Black dads are
an endangered species.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.938
- Don't throw one away, my nig.
- Maybe you're right, Jamal.

04:00.940 --> 04:04.074
Plus, it would be nice to have
a real dad instead of my iDad.

04:04.076 --> 04:06.410
<i>Have a good day at school, son.</i>

04:06.412 --> 04:11.057
<i>And remember,
iDad loves you, Grover.</i>

04:11.250 --> 04:13.284
And this is where
all the magic happens.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.286
And by "magic," I mean making
white people's money disappear.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.456
Oh, that's yo daddy? He look
like Malcolm X in Pro-Keds.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.125
- They nice, though.
- That bow tie is pretty spiffy, though.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.828
I thought only fancy gay men
wore bow ties.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.563
Is your daddy fancy, Malik?

04:26.565 --> 04:28.966
I am heterosexual through
and through,

04:28.968 --> 04:31.835
my Asian and Latino impish devils.

04:31.837 --> 04:33.771
Malik, you're not in school, son?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.806
Like I said, why would I
be a part of the oppressor's

04:35.808 --> 04:39.209
educational system and learn
his-story instead of our-story?

04:39.211 --> 04:41.045
Naw, man.
I'd rather get my paper.

04:41.047 --> 04:44.081
That's my son!
Poison them devils!

04:44.083 --> 04:46.884
- Hey, you got that work?
- You want to take this one, Dad?

04:46.886 --> 04:50.120
Sell drugs and watch the white
devils mire in addiction?

04:50.122 --> 04:52.589
It would be my honor.
Give me them drugs.

04:52.591 --> 04:55.793
- What's your pleasure, peckerwood?
- That's my dad.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.795
<i>Back to
"American Negro Warrior."</i>

05:01.707 --> 05:03.974
<i> I got it!</i>

05:05.011 --> 05:08.245
Oh no, no, no, we're not gonna
spend the afternoon on our asses.

05:08.247 --> 05:09.847
Man, what's your daddy
talking about?

05:09.849 --> 05:11.916
There are going to be
some changes around here.

05:11.918 --> 05:13.684
You both are going to
clean the kitchen.

05:13.686 --> 05:15.286
I ain't cleaning shit.

05:15.288 --> 05:18.155
- And what you 'bout to do with that?
- Beat the breaks off you!

05:19.192 --> 05:21.746
Oh, shit, he ain't playing.

05:22.094 --> 05:24.862
- Man, this some bullshit.
- Man, this is hard work.

05:24.864 --> 05:26.997
But in a weird way,
I kind of like it.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
Mama always working,
so it's good to have

05:29.001 --> 05:31.068
a responsible man in
the house besides Malik

05:31.070 --> 05:32.403
to teach us how to be men.

05:32.405 --> 05:34.138
[bleep] that responsible mother[bleep].

05:34.140 --> 05:36.207
When he go to sleep,
I'm [bleep] him up.

05:36.209 --> 05:38.642
You missed a spot.
You better not let Daddy see.

05:38.644 --> 05:40.477
Man, ain't nobody scared of
your daddy.

05:41.547 --> 05:44.815
Over here, doing all this stuff.
 Man, act like a maid.

05:46.152 --> 05:48.352
<i>- Annyeong!
- This the spot.</i>

05:48.354 --> 05:50.287
The app say to ask for "Feng Shui."

05:50.289 --> 05:52.811
Say here she got three
out of four squirts.

05:53.059 --> 05:54.291
Hello, gentlemen.

05:54.293 --> 05:57.328
- How may I do you?
- Yo, we here to see Feng Shui.

05:57.330 --> 06:00.030
Oh, very sorry, but
Feng Shui not here now.

06:00.032 --> 06:02.584
She come in later.
You welcome to stay

06:02.585 --> 06:05.336
and have lovely treatments
until she come here.

06:05.338 --> 06:08.038
They do got some decent
side orders here, doe.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.007
I could use a belly-button flush.

06:10.009 --> 06:12.209
And they use real buttermilks.

06:12.211 --> 06:14.879
I am kind of tense,
and Feng Shui ain't even here

06:14.881 --> 06:17.348
yet to jerk on my hammer.
How long 'til she get here?

06:17.350 --> 06:19.016
Not long, few minutes at most.

06:19.018 --> 06:21.252
- I say we do this.
- A'ight, den.

06:21.254 --> 06:23.821
But she better hurry,
my nine crowning.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.427
Air ball.
You suck.

06:30.429 --> 06:32.363
- You ain't never gonna be league.
- What?

06:32.365 --> 06:35.766
Unless you open thine ears
and listen to me.

06:37.436 --> 06:39.503
Damn, you can teach me
to shoot like that?

06:39.505 --> 06:41.772
I taught that sorry-ass
brother of yours.

06:41.774 --> 06:43.607
I can definitely teach you.

06:43.609 --> 06:45.743
- Montrel sucked?
- Did he!

06:49.188 --> 06:51.388
- Ugh!
- Get that shit out of here!

06:51.390 --> 06:53.791
- Man, that was a foul!
- Stop crying, nigga!

06:53.793 --> 06:56.927
That wasn't a foul...
your face is part of the ball.

06:56.929 --> 06:58.763
- Man, I quit.
- You can't quit.

06:58.765 --> 07:02.266
We had a bet... I win, I don't have
to buy you nothing for Christmas.

07:02.268 --> 07:03.968
Ball up!
Let's go!

07:06.005 --> 07:07.037
Ugh!

07:08.274 --> 07:11.442
All right, that's no Christmas.
Again.

07:13.012 --> 07:16.380
If I can make him good, I can
definitely make you league.

07:16.382 --> 07:18.983
Thanks.
That's what I've always wanted...

07:18.985 --> 07:20.084
- Dad.
- Who?

07:20.086 --> 07:22.960
Oh, me, right.
Yeah, don't mention it, son.

07:22.995 --> 07:26.652
You get what you want,
and I get what I want.

07:28.605 --> 07:30.539
You say you played ball
with Marvin?

07:30.541 --> 07:32.808
And you, you was slinging rocks
with his ass?

07:32.810 --> 07:35.243
Man, I can't believe y'all
falling for this shit.

07:35.245 --> 07:37.479
I'm telling you,
y'all daddy is up to something.

07:37.481 --> 07:38.847
Our father, Montrel.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.682
And maybe he just learned
the error of his ways

07:40.684 --> 07:42.551
and truly yearns
for the love of his sons.

07:42.553 --> 07:43.885
Man, y'all weak.

07:43.887 --> 07:47.122
I'mma go smoke this new strain
called, "Y'alls Daddy Ain't Shit."

07:47.124 --> 07:50.592
Maybe it ain't him that's the problem.
Maybe it's you.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.796
Oh, shit. Y'all really think
I want Marvin's attention?

07:54.798 --> 07:56.965
Like I was some abandoned
nigga sittin' at home,

07:56.967 --> 07:59.734
lookin' out the window,
two tears in my right eye,

07:59.736 --> 08:01.736
one tear in the left,
waiting for him

08:01.738 --> 08:04.105
to come home from "work"
with an ice cream cake

08:04.107 --> 08:05.473
to celebrate my birthday?

08:05.475 --> 08:09.110
Naw son, that wasn't me.
I was good.

08:09.112 --> 08:10.835
I was good!

08:11.348 --> 08:14.716
<i>Ooh, that feels good!</i>

08:14.718 --> 08:17.385
You like?
I do more for $7 more.

08:17.387 --> 08:20.088
- I'll pay, I'll pay!
- Yo, this feel good and all,

08:20.090 --> 08:22.257
but I'm wondering what's
taking P.F. Chang so long.

08:22.259 --> 08:23.725
We been here, like, two hours.

08:23.727 --> 08:26.094
Just chill out
and enjoy the foreplay.

08:26.096 --> 08:28.530
I'mma be so relaxed
for the game tonight.

08:28.532 --> 08:30.532
I ain't me here
to get my back relaxed.

08:30.534 --> 08:32.567
I came to get my sack relaxed.

08:32.568 --> 08:34.635
<i>Bars!</i>

08:34.638 --> 08:37.339
Oh see, yeah,
that feel kinda good.

08:37.341 --> 08:40.674
- Circle the drain, $50 more.
- I'll pay.

08:40.677 --> 08:42.443
You got my ass all out here
in the open.

08:42.446 --> 08:43.445
Ooh... oh!

08:43.447 --> 08:45.447
Oh.

08:45.449 --> 08:48.383
- So, Feng Shui never took care of y'all?
- Nope.

08:48.385 --> 08:51.553
Cost me $72 and my nine
is harder than poverty.

08:51.555 --> 08:53.121
Yeah, but they got a happy hour,

08:53.123 --> 08:55.290
happy ending special tomorrow.

08:55.292 --> 08:57.893
You finna join this Groupon,
Gropeon, Grover?

08:57.895 --> 09:00.662
Naw, my dad says I should
never jerk on game day.

09:00.664 --> 09:02.230
Like you gonna get off the bench.

09:04.868 --> 09:08.136
Hey, you bald asshole,
put my son in the game!

09:08.138 --> 09:10.038
Would you shut the hell up
and let me coach

09:10.040 --> 09:11.873
the mother [bleep] game
the way I coach,

09:11.875 --> 09:13.675
you loud-mouth mother[bleep]?

09:13.677 --> 09:16.177
You're losing by ten,
Gregg Popabitch!

09:16.179 --> 09:17.812
Aye, peep game.

09:17.814 --> 09:19.881
One of them Frere
Jacques niggs is about to

09:19.883 --> 09:22.651
- get into it with Coach Bundy.
- That's my dad.

09:22.653 --> 09:25.086
If you put Grover in the game,
it might help,

09:25.088 --> 09:26.588
you hard-headed bastard!

09:26.590 --> 09:28.924
You know he got game,
and you need somebody

09:28.926 --> 09:31.026
who can play above the rim.

09:31.028 --> 09:33.028
Some say he's just like Mike.

09:33.030 --> 09:35.430
White men can't jump,
but Grover can.

09:35.432 --> 09:38.233
Where is your Celtic pride?

09:38.235 --> 09:39.668
Are you done, mother[bleep]?

09:39.670 --> 09:41.870
"Hoosiers," "Space Jam,"
"Cornbread, Earl and Me."

09:41.872 --> 09:43.038
Now I'm done.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.673
Oh, and "The Fish
That Saved Pittsburgh."

09:44.675 --> 09:46.641
Damn, G!
Your pops is for real.

09:46.643 --> 09:48.777
He got room for another
black kid like me?

09:48.779 --> 09:50.145
We don't take walk-ons.

09:50.147 --> 09:51.980
You got to get drafted
by your own father.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.482
Okay, you really want to see
how bad yo son sucks?

09:54.484 --> 09:57.002
All right Grover, get yo
ass in the game so I can

09:57.003 --> 09:59.521
show yo daddy why I never
put yo ass in the game.

09:59.523 --> 10:01.656
<i>What?</i>

10:01.658 --> 10:04.926
- Man, what the [bleep]?
- Now that's what I'm talking about!

10:14.371 --> 10:17.305

10:19.543 --> 10:21.176
Aye, I'mma go ahead and say it,

10:21.178 --> 10:22.911
I think yo daddy
is proud of your brother

10:22.913 --> 10:25.847
and only your brother.
How you feel about that, cuh?

10:25.849 --> 10:28.216
- Man, eat a [bleep].
- Aye, don't get mad at me.

10:28.218 --> 10:30.251
My dad here to support me, cuh.

10:33.056 --> 10:35.623
It's been real nice
catching up with you, son.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.759
Well, at least we're
making up for lost time now.

10:37.761 --> 10:40.729
Exactly.
I'm glad you feel that way, son.

10:40.731 --> 10:44.532
'Cause I really think we sh...
Goddamn!

10:44.534 --> 10:46.801
Look at that white girl
with all that ass!

10:46.803 --> 10:49.988
Uh, oh, I'm sorry.
I think we could truly

10:49.989 --> 10:53.141
make up for lost time
if you lived closer to me.

10:53.143 --> 10:54.509
Like move in with you?

10:54.511 --> 10:57.512
A boy your age needs
his father in his life.

10:57.514 --> 10:59.548
Why don't you think about it

10:59.549 --> 11:04.019
while buying the new Shackles?
They got the new Kintes.

11:05.022 --> 11:06.955
Hey, baby.
It won't be long now.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.490
I took him out
for some ice cream,

11:08.492 --> 11:11.326
and when he comes
to live with us, we'll be set.

11:19.336 --> 11:20.568
Oh, that was nice.

11:20.570 --> 11:23.405
Boy, you looked like that
Iguodala player for Golden State.

11:23.407 --> 11:25.006
Next time,
what you gonna do, son?

11:25.008 --> 11:27.409
- I'm gonna dunk!
- That's my boy.

11:27.411 --> 11:28.977
Man, this shit is all wrong.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.112
- What you mean, Montrel?
- I mean him.

11:31.114 --> 11:33.982
- Grover, you go on and go to bed.
- Okay, Dad.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.583
Are you gonna come tuck me in?

11:35.585 --> 11:37.185
Tuck you in?
Where they do that at?

11:37.187 --> 11:39.254
My bad, got a little carried away.

11:39.256 --> 11:41.256
Please don't leave me again.

11:41.258 --> 11:43.191
What's wrong with your
bitch ass now?

11:43.193 --> 11:45.260
You can't be happy
for your little brother?

11:45.262 --> 11:48.296
Oh, I'm happy for him.
I just want to know...

11:48.298 --> 11:50.065
how come you don't want me, man?

11:50.067 --> 11:52.518
- Oh, hell.
- Did you ever stop to think

11:52.519 --> 11:55.370
of what I might've become
if I had my daddy in my life?

11:55.372 --> 11:57.806
Probably wouldn't be
a bitch ass momma's boy.

11:59.776 --> 12:01.910
Man, hold up, nigga,
stop laughing at me.

12:01.912 --> 12:04.279
- Can't you see I'm in pain?
- What you just call me?

12:04.281 --> 12:07.415
- Take yo ass outside and get me a switch.
- Nigga, for what?

12:07.417 --> 12:09.951
You think I'm just gonna stand
here and let you call me

12:09.953 --> 12:12.353
an n-word while you crying
with snot and shit

12:12.355 --> 12:13.621
running out of your nose?

12:13.623 --> 12:15.857
Go and get me a switch now
and it better not

12:15.859 --> 12:16.925
be a little one, neither.

12:16.927 --> 12:19.812
Ain't gonna make me a...

12:19.813 --> 12:21.948
this sorry ass, bitch made...

12:26.503 --> 12:27.969
<i>Daddy!</i>

12:31.274 --> 12:32.307
You all right?

12:32.309 --> 12:34.242
Didn't you see Marvin
whoop my ass?

12:34.244 --> 12:37.345
- Hell naw, I'm not alright.
- Real talk, you deserved it.

12:37.347 --> 12:38.513
He just wants the best for us.

12:38.515 --> 12:40.982
Well, he should want me, then.
I am the best.

12:40.984 --> 12:42.617
Better than you sorry bastards.

12:42.619 --> 12:44.486
Stop being a hater
and face the facts.

12:44.488 --> 12:46.955
He's our daddy,
and he's gonna be around,

12:46.957 --> 12:50.191
- so you better get used to it.
- Man, I ain't got to get used to shit.

12:50.193 --> 12:52.060
Once Shea remember
where he left his gun,

12:52.062 --> 12:53.962
we gonna run his bitch ass
up out of here.

12:53.964 --> 12:55.697
You ain't never gonna see
him again.

12:55.699 --> 12:57.999
You got to get through me
to get to dad.

12:58.001 --> 13:00.201
Man, first of all,
I will [bleep] you up.

13:00.203 --> 13:02.003
I guess you got to
[bleep] me up then.

13:02.005 --> 13:04.873
Man, after everything I've
done for you, you choose him?

13:04.875 --> 13:06.975
That's cool, you can choose him
all you want.

13:06.977 --> 13:09.611
- He ain't living here.
- Fine, neither am I.

13:09.613 --> 13:11.446
Man, where the hell
you think you goin'?

13:11.448 --> 13:14.883
To live with Dad at his other house.
I'm out of here.

13:15.919 --> 13:17.819
<i>Aye, cuh, found my gun.</i>

13:17.821 --> 13:19.621
<i>Oh shit, this ain't mine.</i>

13:19.623 --> 13:21.774
<i>This my momma's.
I'll be back.</i>

13:27.653 --> 13:30.154
Aye, what's up, cuh?
You can't come out and play?

13:30.156 --> 13:31.388
Man, I'm on punishment.

13:31.390 --> 13:35.059
Marvin said I gots to stay in my
room "until otherwise notified."

13:35.061 --> 13:38.662
- Ain't that some shit?
- Damn, you got it bad like Usher, cuh.

13:38.664 --> 13:40.864
Man, I can't let shit
go down like this.

13:40.866 --> 13:42.433
Marvin is up to some shit.

13:44.036 --> 13:46.337
<i>Montrel!
Ain't no toilet paper!</i>

13:46.339 --> 13:48.205
<i>Get me some napkins
and my phone!</i>

13:48.207 --> 13:50.974
<i>There's a civil unrest
in my colon.</i>

13:50.976 --> 13:53.906
<i>I'm gonna be here for a minute.</i>

13:57.149 --> 13:58.615
What the [bleep]?

14:01.287 --> 14:02.252
Oh, okay, den.

14:04.256 --> 14:07.791
These fish better not have no
dicks, or this might be gay.

14:07.793 --> 14:11.328
Well, if it feel this good
nibbling on my toes...

14:11.330 --> 14:13.364
Way ahead of you, my nig.

14:14.633 --> 14:18.235
If this shit is gay,
you can call me Frank Ocean.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.971
Ooh!
This shit's nice.

14:20.973 --> 14:22.840
Dick eating fish is the GOAT.

14:22.842 --> 14:25.743
Oh shit, one's getting frisky.

14:25.745 --> 14:29.646
Aye, no means no, little fish.
Easy with them teeth.

14:29.648 --> 14:32.983
Ah, I think they're trying to
swim up stream, my nig.

14:36.889 --> 14:39.289
He's in there!
He's in there!

14:39.291 --> 14:41.425
He's swimming around
in my bladder!

14:41.427 --> 14:42.726
Suck it out, Milk!

14:42.728 --> 14:44.762
Milk!
Milk, suck it out!

14:45.931 --> 14:46.997

14:58.377 --> 15:01.111
Oh, shit.

15:01.113 --> 15:03.147
Oh word, let me see.

15:03.149 --> 15:05.849
Why he want to ruin all this shit
by bringing Grover in there?

15:05.851 --> 15:07.885
Man, I don't know,
but I'm about to find out.

15:10.556 --> 15:13.281
Damn boy,

15:13.308 --> 15:14.658
Thank you.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.527

with this white bitch

15:16.529 --> 15:19.463
and these little high yellow half breeds?
This yo family, ain't it?

15:19.465 --> 15:22.032
They're beautiful ain't they,

15:22.034 --> 15:24.334
- Now give me the toilet paper.
- Aye, aye, not so fast.

15:24.336 --> 15:27.671
You tell me what you're up to, and
then I'll let you wipe your ass.

15:27.673 --> 15:29.907
Okay, stop [bleep] around.

15:29.909 --> 15:31.141
Give me the tissue, and wet it.

15:31.143 --> 15:34.645
- My ass is really starting to itch.
- Oh, for real?

15:34.647 --> 15:37.681
You gonna have one itchy ass if
you don't tell me what you up to.

15:37.683 --> 15:40.317
Stop playin' son,
and give me the goddamn tissue!

15:40.319 --> 15:42.519
Either you come clean,
or you leave shitty.

15:42.521 --> 15:44.922
You know you get hemorrhoids
that way, right?

15:44.924 --> 15:46.657
All right fine, here's the deal!

15:46.659 --> 15:48.992
This fancy private school
for white kids

15:48.994 --> 15:50.928
needs a black kid
for the brochures.

15:50.930 --> 15:53.230
They had an enrollment special,
bring a black kid,

15:53.232 --> 15:55.899
siblings get in free.
Grover's black.

15:55.901 --> 15:59.403
Do I have to spell it out for you?
My ass is on fire.

15:59.405 --> 16:01.271
Give me the goddamn
toilet paper nigga, damn!

16:01.273 --> 16:03.006
Aye, man, you ain't changed.

16:03.008 --> 16:04.908
Man, you don't give a shit
about Grover.

16:04.910 --> 16:06.610
And he ain't movin' in with you.

16:06.612 --> 16:09.012
I'm not gonna let you
hurt them like you hurt me.

16:09.014 --> 16:11.748
Well, tell Grover
and Metamucil the truth.

16:11.750 --> 16:15.352
- I'll leave and you'll break their hearts.
- Or we can play for Grover.

16:15.354 --> 16:16.854
One-on-one,
me and you.

16:16.856 --> 16:18.755
You win, you can have Grover,

16:18.757 --> 16:22.459
- I win, you never come back here again.
- You, beat me?

16:22.461 --> 16:25.295
I must've spanked you too hard,
you got brain damage.

16:25.297 --> 16:28.932
Yeah, we'll see.
Bring ya ass. And wipe it first.

16:28.934 --> 16:30.372
Niggago.

16:31.270 --> 16:32.420
<i>I been here all day</i>

16:32.421 --> 16:35.205
yesterday and today
and my baby sack is still full.

16:35.207 --> 16:38.809
I actually am very relaxed,
but it would be nice

16:38.811 --> 16:40.711
to go home a squirt load lighter.

16:40.713 --> 16:43.447
That said, where in the
[bleep] is Feng Shui?

16:43.449 --> 16:45.315
I here, gentlemen.

16:48.687 --> 16:51.205
I ready to tug out all your stress,

16:51.206 --> 16:56.560

reach the heights of pleasure.

16:56.562 --> 17:00.564
- That's what I'm talking about!
- All right, let's get started.

17:00.566 --> 17:03.934
My God, she's about to do it, my nig.

17:03.936 --> 17:08.271
- It's about to happen.
- Stay calm, my dude.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.290
Thank you.

17:27.292 --> 17:29.793
Come back here!
You spray, you pay!

17:29.795 --> 17:31.962
And come get this fish.

17:35.551 --> 17:37.751
Oh, you finally showed up.

17:37.753 --> 17:40.554
I should've whooped yo ass
for making mine itch.

17:40.556 --> 17:42.356
Man, shut up, bitch, and let's play.

17:42.358 --> 17:44.992
Ain't no bitch in me.
Check ball, bastard.

17:44.994 --> 17:46.827
Aye, wait a second.
I got a daddy.

17:46.829 --> 17:50.197
Not after this game, you won't.
Firs to 11 wins.

17:52.735 --> 17:56.537
You still ain't shit, boy.

17:56.539 --> 17:58.305
- That's one.
- Man, yo ball.

17:58.307 --> 17:59.902
Last time you gonna
touch it, nigga.

18:27.269 --> 18:30.021
Just like old times, huh?
I got the ball and you still

18:30.022 --> 18:32.539
ain't gonna get no Christmas.
Where's the D?

18:32.541 --> 18:34.274
You'd do anything
for your white kids,

18:34.276 --> 18:36.043
well, I'll do anything
for your black kids.

18:36.045 --> 18:37.377
Give me that!

18:38.481 --> 18:42.749
Goddamn! All right, okay,
all right, I see you.

18:42.751 --> 18:43.884
Sizing me up, huh?

18:43.886 --> 18:45.853
But know this,
whether you make this shot

18:45.855 --> 18:48.589
or not, I'm you, son.
And you're me.

18:48.591 --> 18:49.656
Aye, you ain't my daddy.

18:54.864 --> 18:56.096
Rah!

18:56.098 --> 18:58.499
Game, nigga!

18:58.501 --> 19:01.368
Aye, and this year,
there will be a Christmas.

19:01.370 --> 19:03.237
What you gonna tell Grover
and Montezuma ?

19:03.239 --> 19:04.438
Oh, I'll think of something.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.875
And his name is Malik,
and he's my real father.

19:07.877 --> 19:10.081
That's kind of [bleep] up,
but all right.

19:11.955 --> 19:15.523
I'm telling you, Grover,
the rub and tug was no joke.

19:15.525 --> 19:19.460
Yeah, uh, you know her carpal
tunnel started acting up so,

19:19.462 --> 19:21.829
um, she started using her feet.

19:21.831 --> 19:23.931
And then she gave me
the Draymond Green.

19:23.933 --> 19:27.268
- What's the Draymond Green?
- Uh... that's when she lay on her back,

19:27.270 --> 19:29.937
and she, uh, punch and kick you
in the dick until you shoot.

19:29.939 --> 19:32.473
That sounds flagrant.
I don't know about the Draymond,

19:32.475 --> 19:35.042
but I'm down for that foot action.
Let's go tomorrow.

19:35.044 --> 19:36.877
Uh, can't go
back in there ever again.

19:36.879 --> 19:38.045
- Nope.
- Why?

19:38.047 --> 19:39.814
They had a tuggin'
out of business sale.

19:39.816 --> 19:43.184
- They liquidated the whole nine.
- You should've came, Grover.

19:43.186 --> 19:44.752
- Like we did.
- Yup.

19:44.754 --> 19:47.054
Oh, that's cool.
I guess I'll tell you now.

19:47.056 --> 19:48.889
I'm about to move in with my dad.

19:48.891 --> 19:50.124
Aye, you ain't goin' nowhere.

19:50.126 --> 19:51.826
- I killed yo daddy.
- What?

19:51.828 --> 19:54.106
Uh, uh, uh...
I mean...

19:54.141 --> 19:57.531
I mean, uh, he killed that
interview for this job he got.

19:57.533 --> 20:01.068
Yeah, it's a job coaching the
Coney Island White Fish in Iraq.

20:01.070 --> 20:02.203
I've never heard of them.

20:02.205 --> 20:04.271
They an expansion team
in the Middle East.

20:04.273 --> 20:06.540
- Mission finally accomplished.
- Wait a minute,

20:06.542 --> 20:08.642
he just left us
without saying good-bye?

20:08.644 --> 20:11.479
Well, he did leave you this.
Christmas came early.

20:11.481 --> 20:13.547
He said for you
to buy whatever you want.

20:13.549 --> 20:16.183
But he in the Middle East,
so they may cut it off soon.

20:16.185 --> 20:18.519
You might want to use it
in the next few hours.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.889
You got to admit, Montrel.
You were wrong.

20:20.890 --> 20:23.824
- Our dad's the GOAT.
- Yeah, your father's a'ight.

20:23.826 --> 20:27.728
- Why it smell like fish?
- Uh, we should get out of here.

20:32.502 --> 20:34.502
- So he bounced again, huh?
- How'd you know?

20:34.504 --> 20:36.704
Because there ain't no
Coney Island in the Middle East.

20:36.706 --> 20:38.606
It's in the middle of
the East Coast, doe.

20:38.608 --> 20:40.724
I know it hurts, son.
Tell you what,

20:40.759 --> 20:42.209

you out for some ice cream?

20:42.211 --> 20:43.511
Oh, with sprinkles?

20:43.513 --> 20:46.700
