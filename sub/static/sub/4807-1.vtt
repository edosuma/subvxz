02:24.362 --> 02:25.882
Hello.

02:25.922 --> 02:27.242
Do you live here?

02:27.442 --> 02:28.962
Nobody lives here.

02:32.362 --> 02:33.482
Where's Freddy?

02:34.362 --> 02:35.562
He's not home.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.962
One, two

03:22.002 --> 03:24.722
Freddy's coming for you

03:24.762 --> 03:26.282
Three, four

03:26.322 --> 03:28.922
Better lock your door

03:28.962 --> 03:30.007
Five, six

03:30.042 --> 03:32.442
Grab your crucifix

03:58.922 --> 04:00.962
Be calm, Kristen.

05:11.682 --> 05:13.102
Joey!

05:13.137 --> 05:14.522
Kincaid!

05:14.562 --> 05:16.642
Help me!

05:30.322 --> 05:33.362
Aw, shit, Kristen, not again.

05:33.402 --> 05:34.802
I'm sorry, Kincaid.

05:34.842 --> 05:36.122
Sorry?

05:36.162 --> 05:38.122
You are one spooked chick.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.442
Thank God.

05:46.482 --> 05:48.362
- I thought for a minute...
- What?

05:48.402 --> 05:49.602
Dragging us in here?

05:49.637 --> 05:50.802
Yeah. Cut it out.

05:50.842 --> 05:53.642
You're putting one serious dent
in my beauty sleep.

05:53.682 --> 05:56.882
It's Freddy. He's here.
I heard him.

05:56.922 --> 05:59.522
Freddy is dead...
buried and consecrated.

05:59.562 --> 06:01.202
We won, remember?

06:01.242 --> 06:02.642
He's coming back for us.

06:02.682 --> 06:04.762
Kincaid's right.

06:04.802 --> 06:06.242
Fred Krueger's history.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.642
Come here.

06:09.882 --> 06:11.642
The pipes are cold.

06:11.682 --> 06:13.562
The boiler is cold.

06:13.602 --> 06:14.882
See for yourself.

06:24.442 --> 06:25.722
I don't know.

07:38.402 --> 07:39.682
How are you, Mr. Johnson?

07:41.842 --> 07:43.482
That's nice.

07:45.082 --> 07:46.962
Hi, Kristen.
Rick will be out any second.

07:47.842 --> 07:48.922
You going out dressed like that?

07:48.962 --> 07:50.842
What's wrong with me this time?

07:52.042 --> 07:53.762
I'll just wait by the car.

07:53.802 --> 07:54.922
Me, too.

08:00.642 --> 08:02.042
Something wrong with the stairs?

08:02.077 --> 08:03.602
It's avoid all contact day.

08:04.282 --> 08:05.402
What?

08:08.762 --> 08:11.122
When Dad's popping aspirin
like popcorn...

08:11.162 --> 08:12.922
it's avoid all contact day.

08:16.722 --> 08:18.002
Waiting for a limo?

08:20.402 --> 08:21.522
I'm off to the club, honey!

08:26.362 --> 08:27.722
Let's go.

08:35.642 --> 08:37.962
All right,
anybody have trig this semester?

08:38.001 --> 08:39.402
What happened?

08:39.442 --> 08:41.402
I had a conflict...
homework or "Dynasty"...

08:41.442 --> 08:43.082
and "Dynasty" won.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.082
Sad story.
Soaps will kill you.

08:47.762 --> 08:49.602
Mmm. There's Dan Jordan.

08:51.122 --> 08:54.802
We are talking
one major-league hunk.

09:00.322 --> 09:03.762
You know,
you are one major-league hunk.

09:05.322 --> 09:06.562
Thanks, Alice.

09:07.322 --> 09:08.442
Earth to Alice.

09:10.202 --> 09:12.082
Hey, you spacing again?

09:12.117 --> 09:13.322
Rick, please.

09:13.362 --> 09:15.242
Well, tell you what,
he's a friend of mine.

09:15.282 --> 09:16.402
I'll introduce you.

09:17.762 --> 09:20.162
Just kidding.
But I would introduce her.

09:20.202 --> 09:23.242
All right.
I think I see salvation.

09:33.362 --> 09:34.602
How can you ride
this health hazard?

09:34.642 --> 09:36.722
It's no wonder
that you have asthma.

09:37.322 --> 09:39.842
No, you see, asthma is
an inherited condition.

09:39.882 --> 09:41.602
Read a book now and then,
you might know something.

09:42.602 --> 09:44.842
Speaking of books,
isn't trig your favorite?

09:46.322 --> 09:47.722
'"Dynasty" again?

09:49.002 --> 09:51.522
Deb, do us a favor
and get a VCR.

09:53.202 --> 09:54.602
Hey, baby...

09:54.642 --> 09:56.842
you're sucking
on the wrong nozzle.

09:56.877 --> 09:58.122
Hey, yo, needle dick!

09:58.162 --> 09:59.482
I bet you're the only male
in this school...

09:59.522 --> 10:01.482
suffering from penis envy.

10:04.842 --> 10:05.962
I owe you one.

10:10.482 --> 10:12.442
- So disgusting.
- Hey, Supergirl, it's dead.

10:12.522 --> 10:13.682
Give a bug a break.

10:30.602 --> 10:32.362
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, guys?

10:32.402 --> 10:35.042
That's all you have to say
after last night?

10:35.082 --> 10:37.722
You better be careful.
He's coming back.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.967
Listen, little sister...

10:39.002 --> 10:41.402
you got this freako talent to
bring folks into your dream...

10:41.442 --> 10:43.402
but we don't need it anymore.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.042
Time to start living
like regular people.

10:45.082 --> 10:46.842
Yeah. Let it rest.

10:46.882 --> 10:48.682
Did it ever occur to you
if you keep going in...

10:48.722 --> 10:50.362
you might stir him up again?

10:50.402 --> 10:52.242
Look, we'll help you.

10:52.282 --> 10:54.202
We all have better things
to dream about.

10:54.242 --> 10:57.162
You got that right...
signed and sealed.

10:57.202 --> 10:59.002
Then what about this?

10:59.042 --> 11:01.482
That don't mean dick.
My dog is like me...

11:01.522 --> 11:03.922
drag him into your crazy dream,
and he gets wild.

11:04.882 --> 11:06.202
Here comes your boyfriend.

11:06.242 --> 11:07.647
Can he give you
a good night's sleep?

11:07.682 --> 11:09.042
We don't kiss and tell.
How about you guys?

11:12.202 --> 11:13.642
Look, we'll talk later,
all right?

11:16.802 --> 11:19.642
Those guys are kinda spooky.

11:19.682 --> 11:22.882
Oh... then you must think
I'm a total freak.

11:22.922 --> 11:24.122
I go back and forth.

11:24.962 --> 11:27.362
Hey, lighten up. No one died.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.562
Hi, Dad.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.002
Looking for something?

12:46.122 --> 12:47.242
Shithead.

12:56.202 --> 12:58.082
I'm late. I know.

12:58.882 --> 13:00.362
Damn contracts.

13:01.602 --> 13:02.722
Let's eat.

13:04.402 --> 13:06.282
We waited a long time.

13:06.322 --> 13:07.842
And we gave up, as usual.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.242
You call this vegetation a meal
after a ten-hour workday?

13:15.277 --> 13:18.042
What the hell am I, a rabbit?

13:18.082 --> 13:20.682
Christ, Alice,
try to think a little more.

13:24.522 --> 13:25.842
Yeah, I can think.

13:25.882 --> 13:28.487
I can think of how sick I am...

13:28.522 --> 13:30.282
of watching you
drink your life away...

13:30.322 --> 13:32.722
and taking it out on me.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.162
I'm talking to you.
Are you awake or what?

13:38.202 --> 13:39.722
Dad, don't start.

13:39.762 --> 13:40.842
Start what?

13:40.882 --> 13:43.322
Telling the little daydreamer
to wake up?

13:43.362 --> 13:45.242
It's long overdue.

13:46.122 --> 13:47.842
I don't need this aggravation.

14:25.802 --> 14:27.882
Jason.
Come on, boy, come on.

14:28.722 --> 14:30.602
Come on. That's a boy.

14:30.642 --> 14:32.562
You almost scared me, boy.

14:52.562 --> 14:54.762
You ugly sucker!

14:54.802 --> 14:56.002
Damn!

15:03.362 --> 15:04.722
This ain't my dreamland.

15:09.082 --> 15:11.082
If you're here,
I'm gonna pound your ass!

16:54.682 --> 16:56.602
Fuckin' "A."

17:30.842 --> 17:33.002
You shouldn't have buried me.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.962
I'm not dead.

18:18.202 --> 18:20.362
Take that, motherfucker!

18:55.842 --> 18:59.322
Kristen, Freddy's back!

19:11.442 --> 19:13.162
I'll see you in hell.

19:14.242 --> 19:16.202
Tell 'em Freddy sent ya.

19:21.362 --> 19:23.362
One down...

19:23.402 --> 19:24.762
two to go.

21:22.522 --> 21:23.642
Wait.

21:29.482 --> 21:31.642
How's this for a wet dream?

21:37.602 --> 21:39.442
Kristen! Help!

21:48.602 --> 21:49.682
Show it!

22:04.282 --> 22:05.482
Hi, guys.

22:36.202 --> 22:37.842
Sorta defeats the purpose,
don't it?

22:37.882 --> 22:40.162
- What?
- The mirror.

22:40.202 --> 22:41.562
You can't see yourself in it.

22:42.522 --> 22:43.922
I don't want to.

22:45.562 --> 22:48.522
You know,
if Mom was still alive...

22:48.562 --> 22:50.522
Dad wouldn't treat us like this.

22:51.362 --> 22:54.602
Alice, you gotta learn
to stand up for yourself.

22:55.282 --> 22:56.602
You know, fight back.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.362
Like that.
It's all in the mind.

23:00.402 --> 23:01.642
You see yourself
doing something...

23:01.682 --> 23:03.042
and your body reacts
and does it.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.202
Like so.

23:05.682 --> 23:06.762
Like that. Now you do it.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.242
Me? No, I can't.

23:08.282 --> 23:10.202
- Yeah, you can.
- No, I can't.

23:10.242 --> 23:13.562
Yes, you can.
Just get up there and just...

23:14.482 --> 23:16.042
Like that.
Big and strong. Do it.

23:19.322 --> 23:21.442
Good, but, Alice-san...

23:21.482 --> 23:23.802
you must have balance.

23:25.162 --> 23:26.282
So go to it.

23:33.722 --> 23:36.002
Swish. Killed a fish.

23:43.322 --> 23:46.962
Joey, I'm getting tired
of picking up your clothes.

23:47.682 --> 23:48.762
And this crap...

23:48.802 --> 23:50.802
I wish you'd turn it off.

24:18.122 --> 24:19.962
Here you are.

24:20.002 --> 24:22.522
Where were you this morning?
Rick's looking all over.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.322
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid?
I can't find them.

24:25.362 --> 24:26.762
I'm sure they're around.

24:26.802 --> 24:28.522
Well, I'm not so sure.

24:32.162 --> 24:33.682
We have matching luggage again.

24:34.842 --> 24:37.122
The bags under your eyes.

24:37.162 --> 24:38.842
Nightmares?

24:38.882 --> 24:40.402
God, I hate dreaming.

24:41.122 --> 24:42.762
I love to dream.

24:42.802 --> 24:45.162
I just hate the ones
about my dad.

24:45.202 --> 24:47.082
How do you handle
your nightmares?

24:47.122 --> 24:49.362
My mom taught me
when I was little.

24:50.962 --> 24:52.902
Did you ever hear
of the dream master?

24:52.937 --> 24:54.842
Sounds like
a game show host to me.

24:54.882 --> 24:56.402
No, it's a rhyme.

24:56.442 --> 24:59.482
Just have to dream
about someplace fun.

24:59.522 --> 25:00.962
Remember, you're in control.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.322
How do you know so much
about dreams?

25:06.482 --> 25:09.482
When it's all you have,
you kinda become an expert.

25:12.322 --> 25:13.402
We better get going...

25:13.442 --> 25:15.242
before your brother
starts a search party.

25:17.322 --> 25:20.962
Anyway, Kafka and Goethe
have never been irreconcilable.

25:22.242 --> 25:23.722
Kris, where were you?

25:29.482 --> 25:31.882
- Hey, what...
- He killed them!

25:31.922 --> 25:33.682
What? Wait! Calm down!

25:37.282 --> 25:38.722
Hey, somebody help her.

25:51.602 --> 25:53.402
Feeling better now?

25:53.962 --> 25:55.202
Yeah, I guess so.

25:59.002 --> 26:00.362
What happened?

26:01.122 --> 26:02.442
You had quite a nasty bump.

26:03.482 --> 26:04.842
I gotta get out of here!

26:04.882 --> 26:06.082
Now, now, now.

26:06.122 --> 26:07.602
You stay put.

26:07.642 --> 26:09.322
You need to rest.

26:09.362 --> 26:11.162
You don't get it.

26:11.202 --> 26:12.722
He's after me.

26:15.402 --> 26:16.802
It's OK, honey.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.042
I wanna draw some blood.

26:35.522 --> 26:36.762
Feeling better now?

26:37.722 --> 26:38.842
What happened?

26:39.522 --> 26:41.202
You had quite a nasty bump.

27:09.482 --> 27:10.602
You seen Rick around?

27:14.362 --> 27:15.722
You are his sister, right?

27:17.082 --> 27:19.122
Rick stayed late after school.

27:19.162 --> 27:20.842
Kristen wasn't feeling
very well.

27:20.882 --> 27:22.322
Could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.802
Oh, by the way, I'm Dan.

27:31.322 --> 27:32.442
Sorry, Alice.

27:32.482 --> 27:34.402
Your shift's over. My table now.

27:37.882 --> 27:40.442
Hi, guys. Hi, Dan.
How are you doing?

27:40.477 --> 27:43.002
Hi. Can I get just a Coke
and some fries?

27:43.042 --> 27:46.042
Do you wanna hear our specials,
or do you want any dessert?

27:46.082 --> 27:48.402
Oh, hi, handsome.
Care for some buns?

27:49.682 --> 27:51.642
- Here.
- You in a hurry?

27:51.682 --> 27:53.602
Gotta get to the library
before it closes.

27:53.642 --> 27:54.842
Killer physics test.

27:54.882 --> 27:57.362
I know. I hardly have
any time to study.

27:57.402 --> 27:59.762
Maybe you shouldn't be
working here so much.

27:59.802 --> 28:02.322
You don't want to wait tables
the rest of your life.

28:02.362 --> 28:04.962
I know.
It's my greatest fear.

28:05.002 --> 28:08.247
You know, he is so cute.

28:08.282 --> 28:10.362
- I wonder where he works out?
- Save it, Deb.

28:10.402 --> 28:12.842
I mean, there is life
after exercise.

28:12.882 --> 28:14.002
One of these days...

28:14.042 --> 28:16.242
I'm gonna set you up
with a real guy...

28:16.282 --> 28:18.202
teach you to get
your priorities straight.

28:18.242 --> 28:19.522
I think Sheila's
more interested...

28:19.562 --> 28:21.602
in dissecting bodies
than their outsides.

28:21.642 --> 28:24.882
Give her time. Her hormones
will kick in some day.

28:24.922 --> 28:28.722
Deb, later in life,
you'll appreciate my motto.

28:28.762 --> 28:32.362
- What's that?
- Mind over matter.

28:33.722 --> 28:34.842
I'll see you later, OK?

28:41.442 --> 28:42.962
Alice, can you leave here?

28:43.002 --> 28:44.162
What's wrong?

28:44.202 --> 28:45.962
Kincaid and Joey
died last night.

28:46.002 --> 28:47.482
What?

28:47.522 --> 28:49.842
Hey, Rick, come here!

28:49.882 --> 28:51.002
Stay with her.

28:51.962 --> 28:53.802
Kristen, what happened?

28:54.762 --> 28:56.842
Look, you're gonna hear
all kinds of stories.

28:58.042 --> 29:00.202
And after all
we've been through together...

29:00.842 --> 29:02.842
how could I let him get to them?

29:02.882 --> 29:04.562
We were a team.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.282
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch.

29:07.322 --> 29:08.442
Who?

29:09.482 --> 29:11.122
Rick, we gotta go.

29:12.002 --> 29:13.362
- Now.
- I'm coming.

29:14.202 --> 29:15.762
Before it's too late.

29:15.802 --> 29:17.762
I gotta go.
I guess I'll talk to you later.

29:32.842 --> 29:34.482
So, why the haunted house?

29:35.562 --> 29:37.602
It's not just a house.

29:37.642 --> 29:39.842
It's his home.

29:39.882 --> 29:42.082
He's waiting in there
for me to dream.

29:42.122 --> 29:43.522
Hey, it's OK. We're with you.

29:44.442 --> 29:46.202
I told you, you can't help me.

29:47.042 --> 29:48.682
This isn't a normal nightmare.

29:49.722 --> 29:50.962
I'm history.

29:52.002 --> 29:53.562
I don't get it.

29:55.562 --> 29:57.002
- Come on.
- Jeez. What'd I miss?

29:57.802 --> 29:59.562
She told us a story
about Freddy.

29:59.602 --> 30:02.167
Fred Krueger.
He's a town legend.

30:02.202 --> 30:04.602
He was a child killer
freed on a technicality.

30:05.602 --> 30:06.682
So?

30:06.722 --> 30:08.842
So, a lot of parents
got pissed off...

30:09.762 --> 30:11.922
and, according to Kris...

30:11.962 --> 30:13.482
they hunted him down
and roasted him...

30:13.522 --> 30:15.202
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

30:16.122 --> 30:17.202
Nice neighborhood.

30:18.242 --> 30:19.922
Anyway,
that's where it gets weird.

30:19.962 --> 30:22.762
She says that he comes back
in dreams.

30:22.802 --> 30:24.402
And if he kills you
in your dream...

30:25.402 --> 30:26.722
you're dead for real.

30:30.402 --> 30:32.402
Now I lay me down to sleep.

30:32.442 --> 30:35.322
The master of dreams,
my soul I'll keep.

30:36.362 --> 30:38.962
Dream master.
I think I remember the rhyme.

30:42.642 --> 30:45.522
Kristen, get the hell
away from that house!

30:45.557 --> 30:46.962
! Andale!

30:51.842 --> 30:53.762
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

30:53.842 --> 30:54.962
I'll take care of you.

30:57.362 --> 30:58.442
I better go.

30:58.482 --> 30:59.962
OK...

31:00.042 --> 31:02.122
but I'll call you tonight,
and we'll get through this.

31:17.642 --> 31:19.042
Shotgun.

31:31.522 --> 31:33.162
Something the matter
with the cuisine?

31:34.242 --> 31:36.047
Well, Mom, I'll tell you...

31:36.082 --> 31:39.522
when two of your friends
die in the same day...

31:39.562 --> 31:41.562
let me know what it does
to your appetite.

31:41.602 --> 31:42.682
You're just tired.

31:42.722 --> 31:45.562
Don't think I haven't noticed
you aren't sleeping.

31:45.597 --> 31:48.642
That has got to stop, honey.

31:55.042 --> 31:56.762
What's wrong with me?

31:56.797 --> 31:58.482
Adolescent anxiety.

31:58.522 --> 31:59.962
That'll make it better.

32:05.642 --> 32:07.282
Oh, God.

32:07.322 --> 32:09.242
Mom, what did you do?

32:12.522 --> 32:15.042
Jesus! Sleeping pills?

32:16.322 --> 32:18.362
Look, Kristen, I'm sorry.

32:18.402 --> 32:19.842
Sorry?

32:19.882 --> 32:22.042
Sorry that you
and your tennis pals...

32:22.082 --> 32:24.362
torched this guy,
and now he's after me?

32:24.402 --> 32:27.562
In case you haven't been
keeping score...

32:27.602 --> 32:31.082
it's his fucking banquet,
and I'm the last course!

32:31.122 --> 32:33.802
We went over this in therapy!

32:33.837 --> 32:35.682
No, Mother.

32:35.722 --> 32:37.522
You just murdered me.

32:37.562 --> 32:40.042
Take that
to your goddamn therapy.

33:25.682 --> 33:27.282
Dream someplace fun.

33:48.762 --> 33:50.722
Thanks, Alice.

33:53.802 --> 33:55.002
Hi, little girl.

33:57.242 --> 33:59.842
- What's your name?
- Alice.

33:59.882 --> 34:01.802
I have a friend named Alice.

35:53.682 --> 35:55.722
Elm Street's last brat.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.802
Farewell.

35:57.842 --> 35:59.802
We beat you before!

35:59.842 --> 36:03.202
And now you're all alone!

36:03.242 --> 36:06.802
Kristen, why don't you...

36:07.522 --> 36:09.482
call on one of
your little friends?

36:09.522 --> 36:10.682
Maybe they could help.

36:10.722 --> 36:12.042
Never!

36:12.082 --> 36:14.282
I'm the last!

36:14.322 --> 36:16.682
Why don't you reach out...

36:16.717 --> 36:18.242
and cut someone?

36:37.322 --> 36:38.522
How sweet.

36:38.562 --> 36:40.442
Fresh meat.

36:45.122 --> 36:47.362
Alice, wake up and get out!

36:48.322 --> 36:50.762
Alice, I'm so sorry.
It was a mistake.

36:50.802 --> 36:52.562
I pulled you in.

36:52.602 --> 36:55.402
Alice, come to Daddy.

36:55.442 --> 36:57.802
Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch!

36:59.322 --> 37:01.962
Now no one sleeps.

37:07.522 --> 37:09.762
The souls of my children.

37:12.842 --> 37:15.282
You'll need my power.

37:48.522 --> 37:49.762
Are you OK?

37:50.962 --> 37:53.082
Kristen...
we've gotta get to her house!

38:13.882 --> 38:15.442
Oh, God! Kristen!

38:15.482 --> 38:17.642
Let me go.

38:36.962 --> 38:39.882
Hi, Alice.
Wish you were here.

38:39.922 --> 38:42.442
Your horrible brother's
up to his old tricks.

38:42.482 --> 38:45.202
Rick, as long as I've known you,
I've always wanted to ask...

38:45.242 --> 38:48.042
what the hell this shit is
you put in your hair.

38:55.162 --> 38:56.402
I want his body.

38:56.442 --> 38:58.322
That's bullshit.
What else do you want?

38:58.362 --> 38:59.802
She wants my body.

39:04.122 --> 39:06.682
Alice, what are you doing?

39:08.562 --> 39:09.682
I don't know.

39:14.202 --> 39:16.122
It makes me feel better.

39:20.482 --> 39:21.922
What are you doing?

39:21.957 --> 39:23.682
Hello, baby.

39:23.722 --> 39:24.842
Great.

39:26.122 --> 39:27.842
You made her so happy then.

39:29.802 --> 39:31.882
Until all this Freddy shit.

39:33.522 --> 39:35.002
Why didn't I just stay with her?

39:35.042 --> 39:36.962
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

39:37.002 --> 39:38.922
Sure it would have.

39:38.962 --> 39:43.282
No. I saw it happen in my dream.

39:45.202 --> 39:46.602
There was this horrible man.

39:49.002 --> 39:50.562
I don't wanna hear
about Freddy, OK?

39:50.602 --> 39:53.402
I heard it all from Kristen,
so stop it.

39:53.442 --> 39:56.322
I could smell the smoke.

39:56.362 --> 39:58.442
I could feel the heat
from the fire.

39:58.482 --> 40:00.682
- It wasn't a dream!
- Just stop it!

40:01.642 --> 40:04.002
She wasn't crazy
and neither are you...

40:04.042 --> 40:06.402
so just cut it out. Please.

40:08.042 --> 40:10.082
Jeez.
Why are you acting this way?

40:12.042 --> 40:13.482
I don't know, Rick.

40:14.522 --> 40:16.202
I just feel so different.

40:21.402 --> 40:23.522
Something happened in the dream.

40:24.802 --> 40:28.362
And now it's like
part of her is with me.

40:34.522 --> 40:35.962
I love you, too!

40:36.002 --> 40:37.562
Hello, everyone!

40:40.402 --> 40:42.962
Girl, I am so dead on my feet.

40:43.002 --> 40:45.842
- We have matching luggage.
- What do you mean?

40:45.882 --> 40:48.282
You didn't sleep last night?

40:48.322 --> 40:50.082
It's that obvious, huh?

40:50.122 --> 40:53.327
- Then you saw him, too.
- Saw who?

40:53.362 --> 40:55.562
I was up all night cramming
for that physics test.

40:56.882 --> 40:59.482
Oh, and I put this
little baby together.

40:59.522 --> 41:02.482
You know Deb's afraid of bugs.
I made it for her.

41:02.522 --> 41:04.402
Ultrahigh sound waves.

41:04.442 --> 41:06.602
It'll make 'em run,
screaming their antennas off.

41:08.802 --> 41:10.602
Look, I'll see you in class, OK?

41:22.162 --> 41:23.762
I don't smoke.

41:38.962 --> 41:42.282
All right,
you've got forty minutes.

41:42.322 --> 41:44.882
So good luck. Go for it.

43:11.122 --> 43:12.402
Help me!

43:12.442 --> 43:13.522
Help!

43:13.562 --> 43:15.562
Wake up!

43:15.602 --> 43:16.722
Wake up, damn it!

44:08.642 --> 44:10.962
Wanna suck face?

44:15.922 --> 44:17.722
Sheila, wake up!

44:22.482 --> 44:24.162
You flunked.

44:32.242 --> 44:33.562
Give her her thing.

44:40.202 --> 44:43.082
Didn't you see it? He was here.

44:43.122 --> 44:44.522
What are you talking about?

44:44.557 --> 44:45.642
He was here!

45:06.802 --> 45:08.202
Step back, please.

45:08.242 --> 45:09.362
Stand back.

45:13.722 --> 45:15.762
Asthma attack?

45:18.202 --> 45:21.242
What 17-year-old
has fatal asthma?

45:21.277 --> 45:24.282
God, she was gonna be a doctor.

45:24.322 --> 45:27.162
- It was Freddy.
- Enough with that crap!

45:27.202 --> 45:30.202
I saw it. It was my dream.

45:30.242 --> 45:32.002
I brought Sheila in.

45:34.722 --> 45:36.762
Oh, God.

45:36.802 --> 45:39.642
I brought Sheila in
like Kristen did with me.

45:39.682 --> 45:41.047
No, don't!

45:41.082 --> 45:42.802
I gave Sheila to him!

45:42.842 --> 45:44.842
And now she's dead!

45:48.802 --> 45:52.602
I really think Kristen's story
is getting to her.

45:52.642 --> 45:55.482
Dan, I really don't know
if it's a story.

45:55.522 --> 45:57.482
Look at us.

45:57.522 --> 45:59.362
We're dropping off
like flies here.

46:36.242 --> 46:39.162
- Good seeing you.
- Bye.

46:39.202 --> 46:40.642
Come on.

47:02.562 --> 47:05.282
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get a pack of gum?

47:08.322 --> 47:11.642
Hey. Where you been?
I haven't seen you around.

47:11.682 --> 47:13.282
I've been working
double shifts.

47:13.322 --> 47:15.402
Guess you need
the extra money, huh?

47:15.442 --> 47:19.242
Look, you know why.
You don't want to believe me.

47:21.802 --> 47:23.682
Don't you understand?

47:23.717 --> 47:25.562
I can't sleep.

47:25.602 --> 47:27.442
Someone might die.

47:38.442 --> 47:41.442
Let's say that
this is real, right?

47:41.482 --> 47:44.442
Why, all of a sudden,
is this Freddy guy after you?

47:51.202 --> 47:55.202
Kristen was the last child left
of the people who killed Freddy.

47:57.002 --> 47:59.842
Maybe Freddy
can't get to the new kids...

47:59.882 --> 48:02.122
unless there's someone
to bring them to him.

48:06.562 --> 48:08.642
We're gonna be late
for the drive-in.

48:08.677 --> 48:10.562
I have to get back.

48:14.122 --> 48:15.322
I guess I'll see you later.

48:27.442 --> 48:29.722
Ninety-three days
till summer vacation, man.

48:29.762 --> 48:32.802
- You tired?
- No. Worried.

48:32.842 --> 48:34.722
Let's see if we can make it
until summer.

48:34.762 --> 48:36.122
It's like open season
around here.

48:36.162 --> 48:38.682
Pretty weird stuff.

48:38.722 --> 48:41.562
Speaking of weird,
you gotta feel for that guy.

48:41.602 --> 48:44.282
Dead girlfriend,
basket case for a sister...

48:44.322 --> 48:45.522
Shut up, asshole!

48:46.842 --> 48:48.682
What a dick.

48:48.722 --> 48:50.562
You know...

48:50.602 --> 48:51.962
You look wasted, man.

48:52.002 --> 48:53.882
I've been up with Alice.

48:53.922 --> 48:55.282
Hey, how's she doing?

48:55.322 --> 48:57.202
I saw her last night
at the diner.

48:57.242 --> 48:59.122
She's blaming herself
for Sheila.

48:59.162 --> 49:01.042
I know how she feels.

49:01.082 --> 49:03.442
I think about Kristen
all the time.

49:03.482 --> 49:07.602
Maybe I could have stopped it
if I'd have listened.

49:07.642 --> 49:09.042
You mean Freddy?

49:09.082 --> 49:10.602
What else?

49:10.642 --> 49:12.562
You ever take a look
at our town's history?

49:12.597 --> 49:14.482
It's not exactly a safe place
to be a teenager.

49:14.522 --> 49:17.002
Hey, bozos, let's hustle... now.

49:18.842 --> 49:21.682
Well, if I'm next,
watch your back, man.

49:31.402 --> 49:32.842
Where were we?

49:34.682 --> 49:37.962
Every society,
dating back to the ancients...

49:38.042 --> 49:40.902
has had theories
regarding dreams.

49:40.937 --> 49:43.762
What they mean,
how to control them.

49:43.802 --> 49:47.442
Aristotle believed during sleep
your soul roams free.

49:47.482 --> 49:49.802
What it sees are dreams.

49:49.842 --> 49:52.802
The skilled dreamers are able
to control what they see.

49:52.842 --> 49:56.042
There is a myth that there's
two gates your soul can enter.

49:56.082 --> 49:58.562
One is a positive gate...

49:58.602 --> 50:00.722
the other a negative gate.

50:00.762 --> 50:03.682
The key element is that
there's a dream master...

50:03.722 --> 50:05.762
someone who guards
the positive gate...

50:05.802 --> 50:08.162
and, in fact,
protects the sleeping host.

50:08.202 --> 50:11.522
Taken altogether, they offer
a fascinating perspective...

50:11.562 --> 50:12.967
on ancient history.

50:13.002 --> 50:15.362
Those of you who don't
find it fascinating...

50:15.402 --> 50:18.082
you better listen up,
because it's on the final.

50:50.562 --> 50:53.482
Rick, make me laugh.

50:59.042 --> 51:01.082
Going down.

51:33.602 --> 51:34.842
What?

51:47.442 --> 51:50.802
A true warrior needs no eyes.

51:56.922 --> 51:59.362
Come on out and fight me,
you chickenshit!

52:08.402 --> 52:11.562
Ninja warriors have calm.

52:11.602 --> 52:14.122
Find your balance, Rick!

52:16.242 --> 52:19.562
Too wimpy to show yourself,
Krueger?

52:22.642 --> 52:24.402
Well, how's this for balance?

52:39.122 --> 52:40.602
Banzai.

52:43.442 --> 52:46.402
How you gonna fight me
without your weapon, Freddy?

52:53.322 --> 52:55.162
Sayonara, Rick-san!

53:07.602 --> 53:09.287
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

53:09.322 --> 53:13.882
I shall fear no evil...
for Thou art with me
with Thy rod and Thy staff.

53:16.042 --> 53:19.762
Dearly bereaved, we gather here
in remorse for Rick Johnson...

53:19.802 --> 53:23.482
a young man whose death
confounds and mystifies us...

53:23.522 --> 53:26.762
for Rick was in his prime,
beloved by all...

53:26.802 --> 53:28.962
exemplary
of young men's ideals...

53:29.002 --> 53:31.122
and of strong moral fiber.

53:31.162 --> 53:34.962
We grieve our loss but take
comfort in knowing such a man...

53:35.002 --> 53:36.882
rests in the kingdom of God.

53:36.922 --> 53:39.442
Let our faith supersede
our knowledge...

53:39.477 --> 53:41.962
for truly the Lord
works in mysterious ways.

53:44.722 --> 53:48.042
Hello, baby!

53:54.122 --> 53:56.242
I love this.

53:58.602 --> 54:01.442
They think I'm dead, don't they?

54:01.482 --> 54:03.162
This is great.

54:05.002 --> 54:07.767
Hey. What's with the tears?

54:07.802 --> 54:11.122
I wouldn't leave ya.
Come on, don't cry.

54:11.162 --> 54:14.682
I'm here. It was a big joke
to fool Freddy.

54:14.722 --> 54:16.682
Come on, smile for me.

54:17.842 --> 54:20.142
No more daydreams.

54:20.177 --> 54:22.442
Well, gotta go.

54:31.442 --> 54:32.842
Good night.

54:36.442 --> 54:37.762
You OK?

54:39.482 --> 54:40.802
Not really.

54:43.082 --> 54:45.082
Is there anything we can do?

54:45.122 --> 54:46.602
I don't think so.

54:48.482 --> 54:51.402
I guess this is my own war.

54:51.442 --> 54:53.882
No, it's not.

54:53.962 --> 54:57.202
We all have to survive.

54:57.242 --> 54:59.522
I mean, I don't spend hours
working out...

54:59.562 --> 55:02.402
to let some night stalker
beat me.

55:02.442 --> 55:04.522
You don't really get it.

55:04.562 --> 55:06.442
He's not a night stalker.

55:07.802 --> 55:11.002
And it'll take more
than bench presses to beat him.

55:11.037 --> 55:12.962
So what do we do?

55:13.042 --> 55:14.522
Let's go over
to Debbie's tonight.

55:14.602 --> 55:16.162
We have to make a plan.

55:18.242 --> 55:19.962
I got to go.

55:20.002 --> 55:21.882
How about I pick you up
at the diner at 8:00?

55:24.042 --> 55:25.602
Here. It's a good luck charm.

55:25.642 --> 55:28.762
Brings bad luck to the creep
you flatten with it.

55:28.802 --> 55:30.362
This is it.

55:31.562 --> 55:33.922
Mind over matter.

55:42.082 --> 55:44.242
Mind over matter?

55:46.602 --> 55:49.122
Sheila used to say that.

55:49.162 --> 55:52.362
God, every day, she changes.

55:52.402 --> 55:56.042
No. It's after every death.

57:09.602 --> 57:11.882
What's happening to me?

57:16.842 --> 57:19.242
Alice, where are you going?

57:19.282 --> 57:20.802
Just to see Debbie.

57:20.842 --> 57:22.082
No, you're not.

57:25.202 --> 57:27.122
I want you to stay in.

57:27.162 --> 57:30.682
Dad, I gotta go, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

57:36.122 --> 57:38.682
You have no right to stop me.

57:41.882 --> 57:44.482
If you just knew
what was going on.

57:44.522 --> 57:48.082
I know very much what's going on
with you and your friends.

57:48.122 --> 57:52.362
Everybody thinks they know,
but they don't.

57:52.442 --> 57:53.562
Look at me, Alice.

57:54.922 --> 57:58.402
I lost Rick
because I didn't watch him.

57:58.442 --> 58:00.482
I don't want to lose you.

58:00.522 --> 58:02.162
We're all we have.

58:35.442 --> 58:37.602
All the towns in America...

58:37.642 --> 58:40.002
and I gotta move
to the Bermuda Triangle.

58:41.322 --> 58:42.602
That's great.

01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:11.642
What'll it be?

01:03:16.002 --> 01:03:19.122
Come on, honey.
I don't want to be here forever.

01:03:23.642 --> 01:03:27.322
If the food don't kill ya,
the service will.

01:03:27.362 --> 01:03:29.322
Help us, Alice!

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:33.442
The usual.

01:03:33.482 --> 01:03:35.482
No, Alice, don't let him do it!

01:03:35.522 --> 01:03:37.002
My favorite.

01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:38.442
No! Come on, no!

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:39.802
Eeney, meeney, miney...

01:03:39.842 --> 01:03:41.362
Come on, no!

01:03:41.402 --> 01:03:42.482
Moe!

01:03:45.282 --> 01:03:46.842
No, Alice, don't let him do it!

01:03:46.882 --> 01:03:49.202
Rick, you little meatball.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:50.562
I love soul food.

01:03:50.602 --> 01:03:53.482
No! No! Stop!

01:04:01.362 --> 01:04:03.082
Bring me more.

01:04:10.842 --> 01:04:13.482
Your shift is over.

01:04:45.722 --> 01:04:47.042
Come on. We have to hurry!

01:04:47.082 --> 01:04:49.042
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

01:04:57.722 --> 01:04:59.702
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

01:04:59.737 --> 01:05:01.682
We got to stop him.
I'm with you on this thing.

01:05:01.722 --> 01:05:04.842
I want to help you.
I'm on your side, OK?

01:05:20.482 --> 01:05:21.762
Here we are.

01:05:30.042 --> 01:05:31.927
Come on. We have to hurry!

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:34.082
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

01:05:50.682 --> 01:05:52.442
I don't believe in you.

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:54.522
I believe in you.

01:06:06.802 --> 01:06:09.522
No pain... no gain.

01:06:15.322 --> 01:06:18.682
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

01:06:43.162 --> 01:06:47.282
Help me!

01:06:55.842 --> 01:06:57.202
Here we are.

01:07:03.962 --> 01:07:05.242
Come on. We have to hurry!

01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:07.042
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

01:07:13.802 --> 01:07:16.242
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

01:07:16.277 --> 01:07:18.682
I get the weirdest feeling
we've done this before.

01:07:59.682 --> 01:08:02.202
Come on. We have to hurry.
I'm driving.

01:08:02.242 --> 01:08:04.882
Oh, my God.

01:08:04.922 --> 01:08:06.362
We're both asleep.

01:08:06.402 --> 01:08:08.522
He's got us going in circles.

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.442
We got to go!

01:08:28.282 --> 01:08:32.482
You can check in,
but you can't check out.

01:08:38.761 --> 01:08:40.682
What the hell was that?

01:08:42.921 --> 01:08:44.362
She's gone.

01:08:45.841 --> 01:08:48.921
I've collected her
like the others.

01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:01.122
All right,
I'm gonna punch his ticket in.

01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:37.522
I'm sorry.

01:09:37.721 --> 01:09:39.082
All right, get him in there.

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:48.642
Base, this is med seven.

01:09:48.682 --> 01:09:53.207
We have a male Caucasian,
16-18 years of age.

01:09:53.242 --> 01:09:56.242
Multiple lacerations
about the head and neck area.

01:09:56.282 --> 01:09:58.522
Possible internal injuries.

01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:00.962
- What's that do?
- Relaxes your boyfriend.

01:10:01.002 --> 01:10:03.562
- Put the needle down.
- Rules is rules.

01:10:03.602 --> 01:10:05.402
He stays awake!

01:10:05.442 --> 01:10:07.362
Those are my rules, understand?

01:10:07.402 --> 01:10:08.762
Are you nuts?

01:10:08.802 --> 01:10:10.442
He's allergic, OK?

01:10:10.482 --> 01:10:13.362
You should have said something
in the first place.

01:10:13.402 --> 01:10:14.802
Damn kids.

01:10:15.922 --> 01:10:18.082
Don't let them put you to sleep.

01:10:18.122 --> 01:10:20.962
We have to get ready for him.

01:10:36.282 --> 01:10:39.082
- When does he have surgery?
- Fifteen minutes.

01:10:39.122 --> 01:10:40.482
Let him be, Alice!

01:10:42.682 --> 01:10:44.162
They're gonna kill him!

01:10:44.202 --> 01:10:45.962
What are you talking about?

01:10:46.002 --> 01:10:47.082
Let me go!

01:10:47.122 --> 01:10:49.242
Alice! Damn it! Get back here!

01:11:22.482 --> 01:11:23.722
Come on!

01:12:07.042 --> 01:12:08.562
No. No gas.

01:12:08.602 --> 01:12:10.962
No gas. No. Don't put...

01:13:32.322 --> 01:13:34.082
Fuckin' "A."

01:13:44.442 --> 01:13:47.242
Well, it ain't Dr. Seuss.

01:13:53.602 --> 01:13:56.442
Get away from him,
you son of a bitch!

01:14:08.202 --> 01:14:09.762
- I saw him. He was here.
- I know.

01:14:09.802 --> 01:14:11.962
We have to get out
of this place.

01:14:38.042 --> 01:14:41.002
Out for a spin, lovebirds?

01:14:41.042 --> 01:14:42.402
Dan, hold on!

01:15:06.962 --> 01:15:10.002
Alice, it's too late.

01:15:11.362 --> 01:15:12.442
He's hemorrhaging.

01:15:12.482 --> 01:15:14.522
Bring him out of it! Hurry!

01:15:27.882 --> 01:15:30.122
You got to put me
back under now!

01:15:30.162 --> 01:15:33.282
Relax, son. It was rough,
but we pulled you out.

01:15:33.322 --> 01:15:34.842
You're gonna be OK.

01:15:36.042 --> 01:15:40.542
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

01:15:40.577 --> 01:15:45.042
Three, four,
better lock your door

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:49.202
Five, six, grab your crucifix

01:15:49.242 --> 01:15:51.322
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:57.882
Nine, ten, never sleep again

01:15:57.922 --> 01:16:00.682
Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:57.322
You've got their power.
I've got their souls.

01:16:57.362 --> 01:16:58.482
Come on.

01:17:19.402 --> 01:17:21.362
Banzai.

01:17:35.482 --> 01:17:38.562
You think
you've got what it takes?

01:17:40.042 --> 01:17:44.842
I've been guarding my gate
for a long time, bitch.

01:18:41.522 --> 01:18:46.162
I am eternal.

01:18:59.562 --> 01:19:03.842
Now I lay me down to sleep.

01:19:03.882 --> 01:19:09.762
The master of dreams,
my soul I'll keep.

01:19:09.802 --> 01:19:14.162
In the reflection
of my mind's eye...

01:19:14.202 --> 01:19:18.682
Evil will see itself,
and it shall die!

01:19:39.402 --> 01:19:41.242
Let them out!

01:19:58.842 --> 01:20:00.602
You're dead, Krueger.

01:21:09.322 --> 01:21:11.082
Thank you, Alice.

01:21:11.122 --> 01:21:12.722
You saved us.

01:21:13.762 --> 01:21:15.882
Freedom.

01:21:29.762 --> 01:21:31.802
Rest in hell.

01:22:21.522 --> 01:22:23.722
You know, I slept through
all of last night...

01:22:23.762 --> 01:22:25.642
and I haven't done that in days.

01:22:25.682 --> 01:22:27.962
I'm still having trouble.

01:22:28.002 --> 01:22:31.642
I can sleep two,
maybe three hours, if I'm lucky.

01:22:31.682 --> 01:22:32.882
I don't mind, though.

01:22:32.922 --> 01:22:35.402
I have more reasons
to stay awake now.

01:22:37.762 --> 01:22:38.882
Come on.

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:41.362
Make a wish.

01:22:41.402 --> 01:22:44.362
Come on,
you don't believe in that stuff.

01:22:45.242 --> 01:22:48.642
Yeah, I do,
and I think you do, too.

01:22:50.522 --> 01:22:51.642
Here it goes.

01:23:01.002 --> 01:23:02.162
What'd you wish for?

01:23:11.082 --> 01:23:12.682
If I tell you,
it won't come true.
