00:00.247 --> 00:01.706
<i>Previously on "Greenleaf"...</i>

00:01.753 --> 00:03.286
Pastor Greenleaf,
I thought you might want to go

00:03.288 --> 00:05.408
on a post-scandal date.

00:10.085 --> 00:11.433
Isaiah just texted me

00:11.435 --> 00:12.664
and invited me to his rehearsal!

00:12.689 --> 00:13.688
Will you come with me?

00:13.713 --> 00:14.922
You're pastor Greenleaf's daughter.

00:14.924 --> 00:16.390
Yes.

00:16.392 --> 00:17.507
How's it going with your wife?

00:17.509 --> 00:18.770
I don't know what to do.

00:18.791 --> 00:21.158
Look, Kevin,
you need to step up and lead.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.461
Danielle,
we both know it happened.

00:23.949 --> 00:25.448
It was all my fault.

00:26.065 --> 00:28.099
When do you give a damn
about what I think?

00:28.101 --> 00:29.400
Basie Skanks might not be perfect.

00:29.402 --> 00:32.002
At least he's not a false prophet.

00:32.377 --> 00:33.977
I've done everything he's asked.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.055
He doesn't respect me.

00:36.412 --> 00:37.830
I know you don't like that place,

00:37.884 --> 00:39.083
but we're getting out of here.

00:44.424 --> 00:45.623
- Ah!
- Just breathe.

00:45.625 --> 00:46.924
Just breathe. Stop.

00:46.926 --> 00:47.992
Okay, I... I made it here safely.

00:47.994 --> 00:48.993
You did.

00:50.430 --> 00:51.796
Oh, good, my money's not going to waste.

00:56.762 --> 00:58.970
Who's that?

00:58.972 --> 00:59.971
The reporter?

00:59.973 --> 01:01.272
What do you know about him?

01:01.274 --> 01:02.974
Two words, mom.

01:02.976 --> 01:04.275
"Clear history."

01:04.277 --> 01:05.810
Whatever.

01:05.812 --> 01:06.944
I'll be at Zora's after school.

01:06.946 --> 01:08.212
Okay, text me the address, all right?

01:08.214 --> 01:09.632
Will do. Bye.

01:10.323 --> 01:11.174
Hello?

01:12.218 --> 01:13.518
Hello?

01:16.456 --> 01:17.421
Danielle?

01:20.794 --> 01:22.126
Janice!

01:22.128 --> 01:24.328
Oh! Thanks for calling 911.

01:24.330 --> 01:26.364
- What happened?
- She took a bunch of pills.

01:26.366 --> 01:28.833
They're pumping her stomach right now.

01:28.835 --> 01:29.867
Oh.

01:29.869 --> 01:31.035
Come here.

01:32.605 --> 01:34.172
It's gonna be okay.

01:39.379 --> 01:40.645
Okay to come in?

01:48.154 --> 01:49.887
How you feeling?

01:49.889 --> 01:51.556
Is the charcoal bothering you?

01:51.558 --> 01:53.057
It's gross.

01:53.607 --> 01:55.407
And I feel dumb.

01:55.795 --> 01:57.061
I shouldn't have called you.

01:57.063 --> 01:58.129
Oh, no.

01:58.131 --> 01:59.872
I'm glad you did.

02:00.366 --> 02:02.400
Everybody at school knows.

02:03.148 --> 02:04.402
About Mr. Mccready?

02:06.906 --> 02:09.507
They call me names at school,

02:09.508 --> 02:12.601
make comments on Instagram about me.

02:14.047 --> 02:15.379
Yesterday, in gym,

02:15.381 --> 02:16.981
they took my clothes out of my locker

02:16.983 --> 02:19.016
and wrote "slut" on my underwear.

02:21.654 --> 02:23.498
Is that why you took those pills?

02:28.461 --> 02:29.651
Yeah.

02:30.230 --> 02:33.231
That and just... Everything.

02:36.822 --> 02:38.789
Why isn't he in jail?

02:40.640 --> 02:42.273
I don't know.

04:12.031 --> 04:13.331
Come.

04:22.141 --> 04:24.375
Mm. Come on.

05:06.319 --> 05:08.953
Ma, the city buses
don't even come that far.

05:08.955 --> 05:10.975
I still have to pick you up
from the mall at southpoint.

05:12.492 --> 05:13.824
Yes, yes.

05:13.826 --> 05:15.159
A little booyah sounds great.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.315
Okay.

05:18.564 --> 05:19.697
10:00 A.M. sharp.

05:19.699 --> 05:20.731
I love you, too.

05:20.733 --> 05:23.300
- What the heck is booyah?
- Just a stew.

05:23.302 --> 05:24.568
Where she comes from,

05:24.570 --> 05:25.855
people make it when a baby's born.

05:26.439 --> 05:28.005
And what are we going to tell her?

05:28.007 --> 05:29.040
About what?

05:29.042 --> 05:30.508
Why we made her wait so long

05:30.510 --> 05:31.742
to visit her grandson?

05:33.960 --> 05:35.600
Are you gonna tell her the truth?

05:36.616 --> 05:39.617
No, no, I'll think of something.

05:45.358 --> 05:46.690
- You got a second?
- Yeah.

05:46.692 --> 05:48.492
Just looking at some of these
billboard options.

05:48.494 --> 05:49.527
Hey, come here.

05:49.529 --> 05:51.191
Give me your wisdom on this.

05:52.465 --> 05:54.665
This, this, or this?

05:56.182 --> 05:57.400
Number three.

05:57.402 --> 05:58.636
I was thinking the same thing.

05:58.638 --> 06:00.137
What's good?

06:00.139 --> 06:01.572
Well, not so good.

06:01.574 --> 06:03.707
Oh! Today's tussles
are tomorrow's testimonies.

06:03.709 --> 06:05.256
Talk to me.

06:05.878 --> 06:08.512
Well, we got a little trouble
over at Triumph II

06:08.514 --> 06:09.914
with the excavation.

06:09.916 --> 06:12.428
The water table's higher than
the geological survey indicated.

06:12.430 --> 06:13.381
How much?

06:13.383 --> 06:14.752
Actually, I'm not certain,
but I can check.

06:14.754 --> 06:16.520
No, I mean, how much extra

06:16.522 --> 06:18.489
is Edgar saying it's going to cost us?

06:18.491 --> 06:20.591
About $350, $400.

06:20.593 --> 06:21.592
Hmm.

06:21.594 --> 06:23.360
You know, I vaguely remember bishop

06:23.362 --> 06:25.663
talking about this when
they were building Calvary,

06:25.665 --> 06:27.015
drainage issues or something.

06:27.017 --> 06:28.609
So let's raise us the money.

06:29.068 --> 06:30.334
What do you mean,
like a special offering?

06:30.336 --> 06:32.902
No, I mean more like a surgical strike.

06:32.904 --> 06:34.442
Find one of those seniors

06:34.444 --> 06:35.837
who doesn't like to give
general operating

06:35.839 --> 06:36.796
and tell them,

06:36.821 --> 06:40.056
"God has placed this Goliath
in our path, David.

06:40.113 --> 06:42.012
Have you got the stones?"

06:42.456 --> 06:44.448
Any suggestions?

06:44.903 --> 06:46.150
What's Clara Jackson

06:46.152 --> 06:47.952
doing with all that powerball money.

06:47.954 --> 06:50.087
Now, she hasn't lost it all
at Branson, has she?

06:50.089 --> 06:51.755
Miss Clara's not that kind of woman.

06:51.757 --> 06:53.157
So give her a call.

06:53.159 --> 06:54.692
Better yet, go visit.

06:54.694 --> 06:56.260
Tell her the story.

07:00.299 --> 07:01.432
Let me tell you something

07:01.434 --> 07:03.100
I learned a long time ago, pastor.

07:03.102 --> 07:04.301
You want to do someone a favor,

07:04.303 --> 07:05.829
ask them for help.

07:06.239 --> 07:08.160
You see, even if they say no,

07:08.660 --> 07:11.428
it feels like an honor to be asked.

07:13.412 --> 07:14.840
Okay.

07:29.996 --> 07:31.595
My room is like a closet.

07:32.732 --> 07:34.165
Sounds like where I lived with my Dad

07:34.167 --> 07:35.299
back in Phoenix this summer.

07:35.301 --> 07:37.201
I know.

07:37.203 --> 07:38.501
I'm spoiled.

07:38.503 --> 07:39.537
What other faults do I have?

07:41.274 --> 07:44.008
Oh, um, do you want to come with me

07:44.010 --> 07:45.576
to faith youth conference tomorrow?

07:45.578 --> 07:46.944
That the one I've been
hearing about on the radio?

07:46.946 --> 07:48.045
Yeah.

07:48.047 --> 07:49.713
Reverend Skanks' wife runs it,

07:49.715 --> 07:51.419
so my presence is required.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.717
Yeah, sure, if you want the company.

07:53.719 --> 07:55.886
Want?

07:55.888 --> 07:58.055
I need you!

08:01.127 --> 08:02.660
Who's that?

08:02.662 --> 08:04.461
Oh, Isaiah.

08:10.503 --> 08:11.769
Ah! Guess who?

08:11.771 --> 08:13.204
Jacob Greenleaf.

08:13.206 --> 08:14.405
How you doing, Miss Clara?

08:15.441 --> 08:16.907
Handsome as ever.

08:18.177 --> 08:19.710
Oh, those are beautiful. Thank you.

08:19.712 --> 08:21.278
Oh, you're welcome.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.513
Hope I didn't come at a bad time.

08:22.515 --> 08:23.614
No, no.

08:23.616 --> 08:25.683
This is the best time.

08:25.685 --> 08:28.452
I used to have Horace here
to keep me company.

08:28.454 --> 08:29.620
I'll tell you.

08:29.622 --> 08:32.489
It's been a curse winning this money.

08:32.491 --> 08:34.792
All these people
I thought were friends...

08:35.008 --> 08:36.493
the Bible's right.

08:36.736 --> 08:39.363
The love of money
is the root of all evil.

08:42.168 --> 08:44.825
So how are you doing at Triumph?

08:45.471 --> 08:47.071
You know what, Miss Clara?

08:47.073 --> 08:48.639
Uh, thank you for asking.

08:48.641 --> 08:49.607
I'm, uh...

08:49.609 --> 08:51.242
I'm good.

08:51.681 --> 08:53.096
I'm doing real good.

08:53.121 --> 08:54.021
Good.

08:54.023 --> 08:56.513
I haven't seen a Greenleaf in ages.

08:56.806 --> 08:58.415
You know, some folks, ooh,

08:58.417 --> 09:00.451
they were mad at you for leaving.

09:00.846 --> 09:02.486
But I say, not everybody wants to be

09:02.488 --> 09:05.055
working in their
father's shadow forever.

09:05.057 --> 09:06.257
That's the truth, too.

09:06.259 --> 09:10.127
There's room for two churches, three.

09:10.129 --> 09:11.262
I think so, too.

09:12.657 --> 09:13.857
So...

09:15.334 --> 09:18.154
...what made you think
to call me, really,

09:18.638 --> 09:20.170
after all these months?

09:22.808 --> 09:24.642
I just missed you.

09:24.644 --> 09:25.876
That's all.

09:25.878 --> 09:27.241
That was sweet of you.

09:31.867 --> 09:35.460
Oh, I have always
loved your taste.

09:36.188 --> 09:37.755
These floors are gonna be great.

09:38.101 --> 09:39.690
It's not Greenleaf.

09:40.253 --> 09:41.725
It's good.

09:41.727 --> 09:42.893
I'm gonna go get Sophia.

09:42.895 --> 09:45.301
Oh, hey, Kerissa, before you do,

09:45.303 --> 09:47.241
do you remember Danielle Turner?

09:47.243 --> 09:48.320
Yeah, the young girl that Mac...

09:48.322 --> 09:49.333
Yeah.

09:49.335 --> 09:51.302
She's having a hard time at Hancock.

09:51.304 --> 09:53.237
The kids are attacking her online,

09:53.239 --> 09:54.204
calling her names,

09:54.206 --> 09:55.878
and I'd really like

09:55.880 --> 09:57.241
to get her out of there if I could.

09:57.243 --> 10:00.411
Well, considering that
Zora and Sophia are there,

10:00.413 --> 10:02.379
I'm not sure excellence is the place.

10:02.381 --> 10:04.157
I know. I just thought...

10:05.911 --> 10:07.177
Anywhere.

10:07.715 --> 10:09.687
I can make some calls.

10:09.818 --> 10:10.788
Thank you.

10:10.790 --> 10:13.457
Sophia, your mom's here.

10:14.527 --> 10:16.627
You know, it really isn't that bad.

10:17.043 --> 10:19.430
Grace, do me a favor. Save your pity.

10:19.432 --> 10:20.798
If you hadn't have come back,

10:20.800 --> 10:22.299
we wouldn't even be living here.

10:22.586 --> 10:24.034
Sophia!

10:27.675 --> 10:30.074
So, she's still not willing
to come to a meeting,

10:30.076 --> 10:32.876
but the fact that
she's willing to host my mom

10:32.878 --> 10:35.339
and have it be like normal,

10:36.449 --> 10:37.781
well, that's a step.

10:38.306 --> 10:40.050
It's a big step, Kevin.

10:40.286 --> 10:41.652
That's great.

10:41.654 --> 10:44.655
So, last, but not least tonight,

10:44.657 --> 10:47.299
a number of you have asked me in private

10:47.893 --> 10:48.926
about how to handle

10:48.928 --> 10:51.895
certain urges that come about.

10:51.897 --> 10:54.131
I want you to take one of these
and pass it around.

10:55.768 --> 10:57.334
What is this?

10:57.336 --> 10:59.187
Ipecac syrup.

10:59.772 --> 11:01.291
Now, depending on how much you take,

11:01.293 --> 11:04.447
it can make you throw up
or feel very nauseous.

11:05.044 --> 11:08.479
Now, every time you have
a wayward thought or desire,

11:08.481 --> 11:09.947
I want you to take a dose.

11:09.949 --> 11:12.716
It'll help your body
to understand those thoughts

11:12.718 --> 11:17.064
for what they are... sickness.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.494
All right, let us pray.

11:19.859 --> 11:24.213
Heavenly father,
thank you so much for this day.

11:24.697 --> 11:29.299
Thank you for allowing us
to come together for healing.

12:44.286 --> 12:46.219
She's coming!

12:46.221 --> 12:48.188
- Hi
- How you doing, ma?

12:48.190 --> 12:49.222
- Mm.
- Mm.

12:49.224 --> 12:50.357
So good to see you.

12:50.359 --> 12:51.725
Good to see you, too.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.093
Mm.

12:53.095 --> 12:54.127
You made it!

12:55.664 --> 12:57.964
There she is.

12:57.966 --> 13:00.667
Let me see that grandson of mine!

13:00.669 --> 13:02.569
Here he is!

13:02.571 --> 13:05.872
Nathan Satterlee in all his glory!

13:08.377 --> 13:11.444
It's so nice to finally see you!

13:11.446 --> 13:13.213
You, too, Etheline.

13:13.215 --> 13:17.016
And so nice to finally meet you.

13:17.018 --> 13:19.297
Oh, uh, I can take those from here.

13:19.322 --> 13:20.186
Oh, no, mom.

13:20.188 --> 13:22.789
It's okay. That's her job.

13:23.935 --> 13:26.426
That raccoon is back, by the way, Kevin,

13:26.428 --> 13:27.794
with a vengeance.

13:27.796 --> 13:28.828
Uh-oh.

13:28.830 --> 13:31.431
Do you know what a raccoon is?

13:31.433 --> 13:32.565
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

13:32.567 --> 13:33.800
All righty.

13:36.271 --> 13:37.570
Here you go.

13:37.572 --> 13:39.139
Thank you very much.

13:41.343 --> 13:44.310
All right. Here goes nothing.

13:44.312 --> 13:45.378
Okay. Sorry.

13:45.380 --> 13:46.913
You want me to pick the meat?

13:46.915 --> 13:50.350
I wouldn't offer, but...
please, go for it.

13:54.431 --> 13:56.156
Hey, you're popular today.

13:56.925 --> 13:59.526
Yeah, but not in a good way.

13:59.528 --> 14:00.660
What's going on?

14:01.471 --> 14:02.896
Off the record?

14:03.311 --> 14:04.664
Off the record.

14:06.268 --> 14:07.667
Okay.

14:10.038 --> 14:11.871
Sister cousin!

14:11.873 --> 14:13.406
Okay, do you want to go
to young life with us?

14:13.408 --> 14:15.008
Isaiah can get us in.

14:15.010 --> 14:16.109
I thought you had to be here.

14:16.111 --> 14:19.879
I signed in, but I literally am unable.

14:19.881 --> 14:22.515
It's a period of biblical proportions.

14:22.894 --> 14:25.393
Are you in or out?

14:25.921 --> 14:27.387
Out.

14:27.389 --> 14:28.488
But go.

14:28.490 --> 14:29.923
Do your thing.

14:34.563 --> 14:35.762
Getting out of here, bro.

14:35.764 --> 14:37.831
- Party time. Let's get it.
- Come on, man.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.307
One of my uncle's victims

14:47.309 --> 14:49.242
tried to kill herself yesterday morning.

14:49.244 --> 14:50.710
Sorry about that.

14:50.712 --> 14:51.945
And the kids at her school,

14:51.947 --> 14:53.313
they found out from the news.

14:53.315 --> 14:54.586
They're just...

14:55.383 --> 14:56.716
they're making her life hell.

14:57.242 --> 15:00.587
And the fact that
he's out there, free...

15:04.192 --> 15:06.377
...it weighs on me,

15:07.529 --> 15:08.995
makes things feel hopeless.

15:08.997 --> 15:10.563
Can't let those people
get you down, either.

15:10.565 --> 15:12.899
Every little victory is a win.

15:14.302 --> 15:15.937
I'm going to.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.977
It's just hard sometimes.

15:19.774 --> 15:21.074
And thank you! Wow.

15:21.076 --> 15:22.542
You're welcome.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.211
Well done!

15:25.213 --> 15:26.646
Do you have to go back to work
after this,

15:26.648 --> 15:27.650
or can you stay out?

15:27.652 --> 15:28.921
That depends.

15:29.584 --> 15:31.050
What did you have in mind?

15:31.052 --> 15:33.353
I thought you might want
to blow off some steam.

15:37.559 --> 15:39.459
<i>You're listening to DJ Dave here,</i>

15:39.461 --> 15:40.994
<i>and up next, on "Christians Count,"</i>

15:40.996 --> 15:43.096
<i>we have bishop James Greenleaf
from Calvary</i>

15:43.098 --> 15:45.031
<i>to talk to us about the fall revival.</i>

15:45.033 --> 15:46.799
<i>Tell us about it, Bishop.</i>

15:46.801 --> 15:49.068
<i>Well, we've got something
for everybody this year...</i>

15:49.070 --> 15:51.504
<i>men's night, ladies' night,
pack a pew night,</i>

15:51.506 --> 15:53.439
<i>wildfire... that's a youth night...</i>

15:53.441 --> 15:56.109
<i>and my favorite, friends and family.</i>

15:56.111 --> 15:57.844
<i>Count me in for ladies' night!</i>

15:57.846 --> 15:59.412
<i>I know you're jesting,</i>

15:59.414 --> 16:01.648
<i>but if there are men out there
looking for godly women,</i>

16:01.650 --> 16:03.416
<i>Calvary's the place to meet them,</i>

16:03.418 --> 16:04.551
<i>in no small part</i>

16:04.553 --> 16:05.685
<i>due to the large numbers who show up.</i>

16:05.687 --> 16:07.020
<i>And that's all we have time for.</i>

16:07.022 --> 16:09.088
<i>You can hear the whole segment
on our website,</i>

16:09.090 --> 16:11.891
<i>and be sure to check out
Calvary's website for details.</i>

16:14.729 --> 16:16.496
That's it? That's all you did?

16:16.498 --> 16:18.865
No, no, we spoke for a good half-hour.

16:22.404 --> 16:23.870
<i>Hey, this is pastor Basie Skanks,</i>

16:23.872 --> 16:25.271
<i>and I'm here to tell you</i>

16:25.273 --> 16:27.974
<i>that Triumph church
is more than just a church.</i>

16:27.976 --> 16:30.276
Triumph, Triumph!

16:30.278 --> 16:32.245
Triumph ain't nothing but trouble.

16:35.684 --> 16:38.851
You sounded very clear.

16:38.853 --> 16:40.520
Thank you.

16:40.522 --> 16:42.155
You're very kind.

16:45.860 --> 16:47.958
Why didn't
you want me to visit?

16:48.697 --> 16:49.929
Was charity depressed?

16:50.530 --> 16:51.731
No, mom.

16:51.733 --> 16:53.099
Uh, we just needed some space.

16:53.101 --> 16:55.255
You let the Greenleafs in.

16:56.204 --> 16:57.637
You didn't need space from them.

16:57.639 --> 16:59.472
To hear that Maricel talk,

17:00.519 --> 17:03.271
lady Mae's a second mother to this boy.

17:04.045 --> 17:06.012
Well, how about after it stops raining,

17:06.013 --> 17:07.814
you and I take him for a walk later?

17:07.816 --> 17:09.147
Hm.

17:11.419 --> 17:13.886
I'm gonna need a ride
to the grocery after this

17:13.887 --> 17:15.954
so I can get everything I need
for my booyah.

17:15.957 --> 17:17.490
Oh, no!

17:17.492 --> 17:19.425
Maricel did all the shopping already.

17:19.426 --> 17:20.660
She got everything you need

17:20.662 --> 17:22.161
up and ready to go in the kitchen.

17:24.733 --> 17:27.141
The way you people live here,

17:27.902 --> 17:29.936
it's no wonder you don't need family.

17:34.275 --> 17:35.274
Okay.

17:35.276 --> 17:36.576
We're gonna make contact.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.179
- Ugh.
- Aw, man.

17:40.181 --> 17:41.614
- Geez Louise.
- Okay.

17:41.616 --> 17:43.349
May... may I make some pointers?

17:43.351 --> 17:45.284
- Sure.
- Okay, great.

17:46.354 --> 17:47.987
Oh, no! No, no, no!

17:47.989 --> 17:49.255
You said I'd really
get to hit something.

17:49.257 --> 17:50.323
Come on! Throw me something.

17:50.325 --> 17:51.624
- Throw me something good.
- Okay. All right.

17:51.626 --> 17:53.259
Well, first,
let me see your stance again.

17:56.264 --> 17:58.865
Okay, first, you're standing all wrong.

17:58.867 --> 18:00.033
It's too wide.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.200
Close your stance.

18:01.202 --> 18:03.336
Okay, and your hands are
too far from the body.

18:03.338 --> 18:04.771
A little closer in the body.

18:04.773 --> 18:06.472
Your hands are a little too close.

18:06.474 --> 18:08.207
Do you want to hit something or not?

18:10.111 --> 18:12.412
Stop it! I'm gonna hit you
if you get fresh.

18:12.414 --> 18:13.980
- Come on! Back up, coach.
- All right. Do it.

18:13.982 --> 18:15.381
- Let me see your hands again.
- Let me do this.

18:15.383 --> 18:16.816
- Let me do it.
- Get your hands going. All right.

18:16.818 --> 18:18.184
- All right.
- Let me see your stance.

18:18.186 --> 18:19.819
Not so wide!

18:19.821 --> 18:20.853
I'm gonna banish you to the bleachers!

18:20.855 --> 18:22.364
Just throw the ball! Just stop talking!

18:22.389 --> 18:23.421
All right.

18:24.559 --> 18:26.392
Oh! Okay!

18:26.394 --> 18:28.027
How'd that feel?

18:28.029 --> 18:29.395
Uh, it's starting to feel good.

18:30.365 --> 18:31.898
Oh, yes!

18:33.234 --> 18:34.707
Nice!

18:37.072 --> 18:38.638
That one might have
been out of here.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.908
$7,500 in air time
we bought from that girl

18:41.910 --> 18:44.310
with the understanding
that there would be value added,

18:44.312 --> 18:46.412
that that station was gonna
get behind everything.

18:46.414 --> 18:48.014
I'll call her first thing Monday.

18:48.016 --> 18:49.782
No, I will call her,

18:49.784 --> 18:52.085
and I will tell her...

18:52.087 --> 18:54.787
I will tell her that we want
an hour this time,

18:54.789 --> 18:58.491
yeah, and that I'm going to go with you,

18:58.493 --> 19:00.326
and we're going to do it live.

19:00.328 --> 19:02.328
That's right.

19:02.330 --> 19:03.696
Yes?

19:03.698 --> 19:05.064
First lady? Bishop?

19:05.066 --> 19:06.451
- Yes, dear?
- What is it now?

19:06.476 --> 19:07.700
Clara just called.

19:07.702 --> 19:09.068
Oh, no! Is she all right?

19:09.070 --> 19:10.069
She's fine.

19:10.071 --> 19:11.070
Oh.

19:11.072 --> 19:12.071
Then what is it?

19:12.073 --> 19:13.940
She called just to say "hi,"

19:13.942 --> 19:17.410
but she said that Jacob
came by yesterday to visit.

19:19.748 --> 19:20.913
Thank you.

19:27.655 --> 19:29.422
You ready to paint that room now?

19:35.334 --> 19:36.732
And, like Joseph,

19:37.012 --> 19:40.146
no matter how much we feel tried,

19:40.148 --> 19:43.922
we must somehow dig deep past our pain

19:43.924 --> 19:46.920
to the place where our
own imperfections are buried

19:47.352 --> 19:49.085
to find the common ground

19:49.087 --> 19:51.176
that makes forgiveness possible.

19:51.689 --> 19:53.017
Thank you.

19:57.973 --> 19:59.762
Think you could do that?

19:59.764 --> 20:01.997
Forgive like Joseph?

20:01.999 --> 20:03.399
I don't know.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.035
Roberto.

20:06.037 --> 20:07.336
I'm Sophia.

20:12.777 --> 20:14.477
So, whether it's forgiving people

20:14.479 --> 20:16.245
or holding back
from doing something else

20:16.247 --> 20:17.327
because no one gets it right,

20:17.329 --> 20:19.849
- and stories are just stories.
- Oh, hey, Miss Sophia.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.751
Have you seen your cousin?

20:21.753 --> 20:26.255
Um, yeah, she just went to the bathroom.

20:26.257 --> 20:29.759
She's been in the bathroom
for two hours?

20:29.761 --> 20:32.293
I'm only asking because I don't
want to get in any trouble

20:32.295 --> 20:33.593
with your aunt Kerissa.

20:33.595 --> 20:35.398
That woman there is a toughie,
I tell you!

20:36.444 --> 20:37.921
Yeah, you know, she's got...

20:38.413 --> 20:39.979
Female issues.

20:39.981 --> 20:42.315
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah.

20:42.317 --> 20:45.051
It's like a tsunami.

20:45.053 --> 20:47.520
She's probably somewhere lying down.

20:47.522 --> 20:50.890
Okay, well, I will go
lift our sister up, then.

20:50.892 --> 20:52.058
Be good.

20:54.896 --> 20:56.529
Stories are just stories, right?

20:56.531 --> 20:58.923
Sure.

21:04.172 --> 21:05.905
What a blessing those things are.

21:05.907 --> 21:07.807
Ugh, or a curse.

21:07.809 --> 21:11.944
Somehow, I feel like I cried
a lot on my own as a child,

21:11.946 --> 21:13.412
and I turned out fine.

21:13.633 --> 21:15.748
Better than fine.

21:15.750 --> 21:18.718
Then again, you'd have to be
a hardened criminal

21:18.720 --> 21:19.885
not to be a good parent

21:19.887 --> 21:21.866
with all the help you got in this house.

21:22.523 --> 21:24.557
It's still a lot of work.

21:24.559 --> 21:26.192
Oh, I'm sure.

21:26.194 --> 21:28.361
I didn't mean to suggest that it isn't.

21:28.363 --> 21:33.183
That's why I was so eager to come help.

21:33.601 --> 21:35.534
I know, um...

21:35.536 --> 21:39.939
We... Just had a lot going on.

21:39.941 --> 21:41.540
I'll be the first to admit
that I don't have

21:41.542 --> 21:43.009
all the social graces of your mama

21:43.011 --> 21:44.910
or you, for that matter,

21:44.912 --> 21:47.013
but there are other graces.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.314
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:48.316 --> 21:50.516
The chicken's browned.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.151
- Oh.
- No, no, no.

21:52.153 --> 21:53.586
I'll go put it in the pot.

21:53.588 --> 21:55.655
You stay here and rest.

21:59.661 --> 22:01.203
This was a nice afternoon.

22:01.896 --> 22:03.562
Hey!

22:03.564 --> 22:04.864
That's what you do, right?

22:04.866 --> 22:07.233
You just keep coming back
and you workin' the calluses,

22:07.235 --> 22:10.380
get some calluses going,
and then you get used to it.

22:10.972 --> 22:12.938
That sounds like good advice.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.003
Well.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.509
This was nice.

22:21.282 --> 22:23.816
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:26.788 --> 22:27.920
Ever since I came home,

22:27.922 --> 22:29.955
I feel like
I've been cleaning up the past

22:30.596 --> 22:32.681
and dealing with the past.

22:33.094 --> 22:34.126
Hmm.

22:34.128 --> 22:36.160
This feels more like the future?

22:37.298 --> 22:38.497
No!

22:40.201 --> 22:41.334
Just the present.

22:43.424 --> 22:45.245
That's a step in the right direction.

22:58.269 --> 23:00.152
Is that off the record?

23:02.256 --> 23:03.656
That was on!

23:18.439 --> 23:19.538
Oh! Sister Greenleaf!

23:19.540 --> 23:20.506
Before you go,

23:20.508 --> 23:22.308
I was just curious to know

23:22.310 --> 23:24.276
if you've given any more
thought to my offer.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.511
To decorate?

23:25.513 --> 23:26.512
Or whatever.

23:26.514 --> 23:27.646
Uh, shopping buddies?

23:27.648 --> 23:29.348
Well, no, actually, I haven't, Tasha.

23:29.350 --> 23:31.083
And it's not that I don't appreciate it.

23:31.085 --> 23:33.052
It's just that I have been
so busy with work.

23:33.054 --> 23:34.720
Oh, I completely understand. No worries.

23:34.722 --> 23:36.222
I can come over any night,

23:36.224 --> 23:38.224
and we can just start
moving some things around,

23:38.226 --> 23:39.492
- getting it together.
- No, no.

23:39.494 --> 23:42.294
- Don't bother yourself.
- It's not a bother, really!

23:42.296 --> 23:44.312
I can even meet you at school
if it's easier for you!

23:44.314 --> 23:45.476
We can go online.

23:45.478 --> 23:47.700
I can get a feel
for your own personal style.

23:47.702 --> 23:50.636
I am just gonna handle it myself.

23:51.087 --> 23:52.338
Oh, okay.

23:53.518 --> 23:56.609
Well, I guess that's
your own personal style.

23:56.611 --> 23:59.578
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be, please.

23:59.580 --> 24:01.680
I'm just as busy as you are.

24:01.682 --> 24:03.315
I was just trying to help.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.885
Well, I appreciate it.

24:05.887 --> 24:07.453
And, sister?

24:07.455 --> 24:08.921
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

24:08.923 --> 24:11.390
I don't mean to alarm you unduly,

24:11.392 --> 24:15.027
but I believe that Zora
snuck out for a little bit.

24:15.650 --> 24:16.662
Did she?

24:16.664 --> 24:18.197
Yeah, Sophia covered for her,

24:18.199 --> 24:20.699
but there was a good few hours there

24:20.701 --> 24:23.169
that Zora turned into Elvis.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.937
She left the building.

24:25.259 --> 24:27.039
I don't want you to think

24:27.041 --> 24:29.275
that I'm suggesting anything about you,

24:29.277 --> 24:32.211
that you don't have
a handle over your own child,

24:32.213 --> 24:34.413
but I was just trying to...

24:34.415 --> 24:36.782
- Help.
- That's right,

24:36.784 --> 24:38.191
just help,

24:38.820 --> 24:41.620
if that's an area that you'll allow me.

24:42.174 --> 24:44.190
God bless.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.199
Well, hey!

24:53.201 --> 24:54.500
Thanks for dropping her off.

24:54.502 --> 24:56.068
I wasn't expecting you to do that.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.873
So what's going on?

25:00.875 --> 25:02.775
Well, Zora snuck out of the conference,

25:02.777 --> 25:04.009
and Sophia covered for her.

25:04.864 --> 25:06.579
That's not good.

25:08.481 --> 25:09.815
All right, I'll talk to her.

25:09.817 --> 25:12.084
I got Danielle into York academy,

25:12.086 --> 25:13.085
full ride.

25:13.087 --> 25:14.320
She can start Monday.

25:14.322 --> 25:15.588
Kerissa, thank you.

25:20.528 --> 25:21.594
Get in here.

25:21.596 --> 25:23.762
Go. Give me the phone.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.566
Are you kidding me?

25:26.267 --> 25:27.533
Honey, what's going on with you?

25:36.277 --> 25:37.676
Excuse me.

25:41.816 --> 25:42.882
Mom, I would've come to you.

25:42.884 --> 25:44.016
You're just across the street.

25:44.018 --> 25:45.818
I didn't want to embarrass you.

25:46.605 --> 25:47.987
Oh, it wouldn't embarrass me.

25:47.989 --> 25:49.321
Don't be so sure.

25:50.291 --> 25:51.924
You heard about Miss Clara?

25:52.257 --> 25:53.926
Did you think I wouldn't?

25:53.928 --> 25:55.127
I didn't do anything, mama.

25:55.129 --> 25:57.530
You showed your face.

25:57.532 --> 25:59.198
I didn't ask her for money.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.433
I didn't even really
talk much about Triumph.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.936
Jacob, I have gone toe-to-toe
with your father

26:03.938 --> 26:05.538
over you for years.

26:05.540 --> 26:06.906
I never asked you to do that.

26:06.908 --> 26:08.474
And what do you think
would've happened if I hadn't?

26:08.476 --> 26:10.743
You think you'd be running
this place right now?

26:12.380 --> 26:15.714
I'd probably be
somewhere else doing something,

26:15.716 --> 26:17.217
being happy.

26:18.252 --> 26:19.417
Jacob...

26:20.755 --> 26:22.521
Darrell James,

26:22.523 --> 26:25.591
the man who died
in the first baptist fire.

26:25.593 --> 26:27.927
I know who Darrell James was, mama.

26:27.929 --> 26:30.296
Basie Skanks is his son.

26:31.866 --> 26:34.166
And he only gave you this church

26:34.168 --> 26:36.302
to hurt your father.

26:36.304 --> 26:37.903
And what makes you think this?

26:37.905 --> 26:39.838
Basie told your father himself.

26:39.840 --> 26:44.610
Son, you're being used.

26:44.612 --> 26:46.545
Come home.

26:49.684 --> 26:51.450
Mama, I'm 40 years old...

26:53.020 --> 26:55.082
...with nothing under my belt
to be proud of

26:55.084 --> 26:56.088
except my kids.

26:56.090 --> 26:57.389
This is my last shot.

26:57.391 --> 26:58.424
I got to take it.

26:58.426 --> 27:00.626
Did you hear anything I just said?

27:00.628 --> 27:01.658
I did.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.314
And...

27:03.831 --> 27:05.798
If it's true, then nothing's perfect.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.673
The man has every right to be angry.

27:13.541 --> 27:15.941
There's no place for me at Calvary.

27:15.943 --> 27:18.544
And time's running out. Sorry.

27:20.648 --> 27:22.181
Now I'm embarrassed.

27:26.387 --> 27:28.620
And the only comfort in all of this

27:29.223 --> 27:32.992
is the hope that the debris left behind,

27:32.994 --> 27:35.327
all the dreams of mine
that you shattered...

27:35.329 --> 27:37.563
you and that renegade sister of yours...

27:38.939 --> 27:41.700
might make a path

27:41.702 --> 27:43.602
that brings me closer to my lord.

27:44.939 --> 27:46.978
At least you mentioned Gigi.

27:47.161 --> 27:49.033
Afraid she wasn't gonna come up.

27:50.911 --> 27:52.544
Goodbye, Jacob.

28:04.045 --> 28:05.909
So is that it?

28:08.365 --> 28:10.182
I said, is that it?

28:12.806 --> 28:14.185
I can't speak for Zora.

28:14.187 --> 28:15.553
I don't know what she got up to,

28:15.555 --> 28:17.288
but, yeah, that's all
that happened with me.

28:17.290 --> 28:18.356
So I'm not gonna get a call from Kerissa

28:18.358 --> 28:19.691
with more story to tell?

28:19.693 --> 28:21.259
No!

28:21.261 --> 28:22.982
What is the big deal?

28:24.107 --> 28:25.807
Honey, what if Zora or this Isaiah kid

28:25.809 --> 28:27.742
got in an accident
or something like that?

28:27.744 --> 28:29.244
Nobody would've known where they were.

28:29.246 --> 28:30.378
You can't go covering up for people.

28:30.380 --> 28:33.047
Like you never did the same thing?

28:33.049 --> 28:34.449
No, I did.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.851
And that's why I'm telling you
don't do it.

28:36.853 --> 28:38.019
Go get ready for dinner.

28:38.021 --> 28:39.988
I don't want dinner.

28:39.990 --> 28:42.190
The whole house
smells like school lunch.

28:42.792 --> 28:44.586
Go get ready for dinner.

28:45.923 --> 28:47.162
<i>Now.</i>

28:52.469 --> 28:55.537
And thanks be to the good
lord for blessing this table,

28:55.539 --> 28:59.207
and for our guest,
who we'd love to see more often,

28:59.209 --> 29:00.775
and family.

29:00.777 --> 29:03.144
Thank you. Amen.

29:03.146 --> 29:05.947
- Amen. Hallelujah!
- Amen.

29:05.949 --> 29:08.283
Etheline, we are so looking forward

29:08.285 --> 29:10.752
to this special stew of yours.

29:10.754 --> 29:13.021
The cook told me you're a
whirlwind in the kitchen.

29:13.023 --> 29:14.689
You took it right over.

29:14.691 --> 29:16.791
I just wanted to do my part.

29:16.793 --> 29:18.793
I'd hate to think of Nathan

29:18.795 --> 29:21.262
looking through his baby book
years from now

29:21.264 --> 29:23.164
and not seeing his grandma Etheline

29:23.166 --> 29:24.632
play some small part

29:24.634 --> 29:26.634
in the drama of his first days.

29:26.636 --> 29:27.779
There's no danger in that.

29:28.863 --> 29:31.673
So how was the youth conference?

29:31.675 --> 29:33.475
Very inspiring.

29:33.477 --> 29:35.076
This girl from Crosspoint

29:35.078 --> 29:38.213
gave a talk on Joseph and forgiveness.

29:38.215 --> 29:39.347
Mm.

29:39.349 --> 29:41.282
I wish mom could've been there.

29:41.307 --> 29:44.886
Well, we'll let it pass that
that was a Triumph event.

29:44.888 --> 29:46.988
Etheline, what kept you in Charlotte?

29:46.990 --> 29:48.089
What do you mean?

29:48.091 --> 29:49.224
Next to my wife here,

29:49.226 --> 29:50.658
I've never seen a grandmother

29:50.660 --> 29:53.495
so vividly intent on grandmothering.

29:53.497 --> 29:55.116
What kept you?
There must be a story there.

29:55.118 --> 29:57.232
If there is, you can tell it to me.

29:57.234 --> 29:58.672
I don't understand.

29:58.674 --> 30:01.022
For weeks before that baby was born,

30:01.024 --> 30:02.675
I called Kevin every day

30:02.677 --> 30:04.606
trying to make arrangements

30:04.608 --> 30:07.041
so I could get the time off at the bank,

30:07.043 --> 30:08.710
and he kept putting me off

30:08.712 --> 30:12.213
as if the due date was unexpected.

30:12.215 --> 30:14.883
Well, they were just nesting.

30:14.885 --> 30:17.051
You know a couple pulls in close

30:17.053 --> 30:20.255
during those last days, very close.

30:20.257 --> 30:22.390
All I wanted was a date

30:22.392 --> 30:24.425
so I could get time off at work

30:24.427 --> 30:25.927
and buy my bus ticket.

30:26.396 --> 30:27.829
I'll be honest.

30:27.831 --> 30:28.897
This whole thing

30:28.899 --> 30:31.268
has left me feeling very unwanted.

30:32.035 --> 30:33.701
Why didn't you want me here?

30:34.705 --> 30:37.172
You can't imagine what it's like

30:37.174 --> 30:39.774
to feel like your child
is ashamed of you.

30:42.279 --> 30:44.112
Excuse me.

30:46.316 --> 30:48.383
Oh, I'm sure that's not the case.

30:48.385 --> 30:51.052
Well, you've come so far,
and you've done so much.

30:51.054 --> 30:53.021
- Yes.
- And... and the...

30:53.023 --> 30:55.090
the heavenly smell
coming from the kitchen,

30:55.092 --> 30:57.926
it threatens to, uh, lift us all up

30:57.928 --> 30:59.060
into the empyrean!

30:59.062 --> 31:01.796
So let's just enjoy your booyah,

31:01.798 --> 31:03.231
shall we?

31:03.233 --> 31:06.167
I don't think I could digest my food

31:06.169 --> 31:08.269
knowing that son of mine is hurting.

31:08.271 --> 31:09.803
If you'll excuse me.

31:16.346 --> 31:17.612
What, mama?

31:17.614 --> 31:19.781
As someone living in the vicinity

31:19.783 --> 31:22.550
of this mysterious agitation of yours,

31:22.552 --> 31:25.320
I can't say that I'm not
entirely unsympathetic

31:25.322 --> 31:26.621
to her plight.

31:28.225 --> 31:30.331
Well, it has been strange.

31:30.994 --> 31:34.529
Sorry.

31:34.531 --> 31:37.565
Sorry it's been
so strange for you, mama.

31:38.368 --> 31:39.467
No, baby.

31:39.469 --> 31:40.769
Oh, lord.

31:48.578 --> 31:50.945
We don't really have
to eat this, do we?

31:50.947 --> 31:53.248
Maricel did make sandwiches, but she...

31:53.250 --> 31:55.116
Good. I'm starving.

31:55.118 --> 31:57.152
Sophia.

31:57.154 --> 31:58.753
I'm with you.

31:58.755 --> 31:59.821
Come on.

31:59.823 --> 32:02.995
Oh, lord have mercy.

32:04.828 --> 32:07.328
So much for common decency.

32:10.634 --> 32:12.443
People.

32:36.026 --> 32:38.593
I'm sorry I made a scene.

32:40.230 --> 32:43.798
I just feel you're being kept
so far away from me,

32:44.199 --> 32:45.928
and I don't know why.

32:47.209 --> 32:48.736
I don't know what I've done.

32:50.974 --> 32:53.007
You haven't done anything, ma.

32:55.445 --> 32:57.178
So what's going on, Kevin?

32:57.180 --> 33:00.129
Until last week,
I was staying in a hotel.

33:00.947 --> 33:02.417
I just moved back in.

33:02.419 --> 33:03.418
Why?

33:04.454 --> 33:06.588
- Did you cheat?
- No.

33:06.590 --> 33:07.889
You can tell me if you did.

33:07.891 --> 33:09.858
Ma, I didn't cheat.

33:09.860 --> 33:11.459
So what's the problem?

33:11.461 --> 33:12.994
Mom, for once in your life,

33:12.996 --> 33:15.129
can you please just
leave something alone?

33:15.131 --> 33:17.699
What could be so terrible?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.513
Oh.

33:31.515 --> 33:32.780
I see.

33:34.217 --> 33:35.950
Hm.

33:35.952 --> 33:37.418
There it is.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.559
Does charity know?

33:48.303 --> 33:49.302
Yes.

33:51.234 --> 33:53.334
So what are you gonna do?

33:57.917 --> 33:59.173
I don't know.

34:03.947 --> 34:05.747
I just... I don't want
to think about it.

34:05.749 --> 34:07.315
That's okay.

34:07.317 --> 34:08.516
It's okay.

34:21.926 --> 34:23.826
I don't want you
seeing him again.

34:23.828 --> 34:25.092
I get it.

34:25.663 --> 34:28.013
I don't want to hear his name.

34:28.652 --> 34:30.967
I don't want to
see you with him at church,

34:30.969 --> 34:32.502
and I don't even want to hear

34:32.504 --> 34:35.404
that noodly little voice
coming through your door,

34:35.406 --> 34:37.273
or else you're grounded for life.

34:50.895 --> 34:54.382
You're just the perfect little baby.

34:55.255 --> 34:58.927
You look like your Daddy
when he used to fall asleep.

34:59.695 --> 35:02.131
I'm so glad I had a chance to meet you.

35:02.133 --> 35:03.499
Yes, indeed.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.871
You come back any time.

35:08.873 --> 35:10.973
You just let me know when you want me.

35:10.975 --> 35:12.526
I will.

35:12.528 --> 35:13.743
Okay.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.444
Bye-bye.

35:16.714 --> 35:19.549
Okay, okay, bye-bye.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.187
I know my supple taste
may not be what you like.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.388
All right, mama.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.991
"My only son."

35:28.993 --> 35:30.493
Those three words...

35:30.495 --> 35:31.994
without them, I swear,

35:31.996 --> 35:35.364
the Bible would just be a blur to me.

35:35.698 --> 35:39.114
But those three words I feel.

35:40.315 --> 35:42.205
Keep in touch, baby.

35:42.207 --> 35:43.619
- I will, mama.
- Okay.

35:43.621 --> 35:44.807
All right.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.112
I just need to see.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.549
So...

35:55.220 --> 35:57.086
It looks so good.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.267
- Hey, brother, how you doing?
- All right.

36:09.405 --> 36:11.667
- Pastor Greenleaf!
- Hey.

36:11.756 --> 36:12.789
Been meaning to follow up.

36:12.791 --> 36:13.923
How, uh...

36:13.925 --> 36:15.427
how'd it go with old mother Jackson?

36:15.429 --> 36:17.786
Oh, uh, you know, push came to shove.

36:18.342 --> 36:19.607
You couldn't do it.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.310
No, I couldn't do it.

36:23.173 --> 36:25.362
That old wound from your Daddy's
still weeping.

36:25.876 --> 36:29.277
If so, that's gonna be
a trouble going forward, now.

36:29.279 --> 36:31.413
The wound I have is for her, Basie.

36:37.054 --> 36:38.520
Who knows how long
the old lady has left,

36:38.522 --> 36:40.271
and everybody's always
asking her for money.

36:40.519 --> 36:41.489
Hmm.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.625
And she gave me props
for coming over here,

36:43.627 --> 36:46.361
so I just want to leave her be
in her perfection.

36:46.363 --> 36:47.996
Well, maybe I should
give her a call, then.

36:47.998 --> 36:51.066
No, just leave her be.

36:51.068 --> 36:52.767
So where are you gonna find the money

36:52.769 --> 36:54.370
- to cover that shortfall?
- I'll find it.

36:55.172 --> 36:56.805
Maybe I'll find it in the pocket

36:56.807 --> 36:58.873
of some disappointed Saint
over at Calvary,

36:58.875 --> 37:00.249
but not hers.

37:01.111 --> 37:04.212
Well, I look forward
to seeing that check,

37:04.214 --> 37:05.680
whoever it's from.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.449
Understood.

37:11.355 --> 37:12.921
I spoke to the principal.

37:12.923 --> 37:14.222
His card is in there.

37:14.224 --> 37:16.091
He's expecting to hear from you
very soon.

37:16.093 --> 37:17.859
Danielle can start whenever she's ready.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.427
Thank your sister-in-law for me.

37:19.429 --> 37:20.729
I will.

37:21.698 --> 37:24.432
The kids there, they're nice?

37:24.434 --> 37:25.977
They're kids,

37:26.570 --> 37:28.393
but it'll be a fresh start.

37:29.006 --> 37:31.973
Short of moving out of town,
it's the best I can offer,

37:31.975 --> 37:34.309
and really, wherever she ends up going,

37:34.311 --> 37:36.705
she's gonna have to learn
how to hold her head up.

37:37.814 --> 37:39.147
If it gets tough, you call me.

37:39.568 --> 37:41.401
And you'll talk to her?

37:42.952 --> 37:44.785
Or you can talk to me.

37:50.527 --> 37:52.627
I'm gonna get her

37:52.629 --> 37:55.830
all the help she needs this time.

37:55.832 --> 37:57.499
Mm-hmm. I know you will.

38:48.351 --> 38:50.885
I can't get away to take you.

38:50.887 --> 38:53.621
You just have to walk
to the end of the block.

38:53.623 --> 38:56.091
Lita, it's 50 yards.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.626
Is that lita?

38:58.628 --> 39:01.162
She ran into Mac today
by chance downtown,

39:01.164 --> 39:02.831
and it's thrown her.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.699
- Sorry.
- No, don't be.

39:04.701 --> 39:06.534
There's nothing to be sorry about.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.238
Calm down.

39:12.709 --> 39:14.421
I do understand.

40:37.928 --> 40:39.694
Why haven't you been preaching anymore?

40:39.696 --> 40:41.729
What's really going on with you?

40:41.731 --> 40:44.732
I didn't come here to
cause you any trouble.

40:45.769 --> 40:47.302
You want to have sex with me?

40:47.304 --> 40:48.770
Yeah, is that so strange?

40:48.772 --> 40:52.407
I found a silver bullet
for that werewolf Basie Skanks.

40:52.409 --> 40:53.908
- Let's do it.
- Are you crazy?

40:53.910 --> 40:55.643
What do you think you're doing?

40:55.645 --> 40:57.445
Stop it! Stop it!

40:58.019 --> 40:59.647
Revival...

40:59.649 --> 41:02.951
a time to reconnect,
a time to be forgiven.

41:02.953 --> 41:05.620

41:05.622 --> 41:07.856
