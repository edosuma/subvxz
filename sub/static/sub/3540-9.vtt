00:04.003 --> 00:06.528
For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.673
I know the risk but I have to know her.

00:08.841 --> 00:10.832
Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.671
- Hello, brother.
- Damon.

00:12.845 --> 00:17.873
He killed Zach, he killed Tanner,
he turned Vicki. I have to kill him.

00:18.050 --> 00:21.247
- No, you can't do that.
- You were right to stay away from me.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.888
- What is that?
- A very important crystal.

00:24.056 --> 00:27.116
It belonged to one of the most powerful
witches of our family...

00:27.326 --> 00:29.351
...Emily Bennett.
- I want my crystal back.

00:29.528 --> 00:30.790
- Bonnie has it.
- Get it.

00:30.963 --> 00:32.759
Don't be giving that back to anybody.

00:34.133 --> 00:37.193
Today we're going to talk
about shadow reckoning.

00:37.369 --> 00:40.770
This is a method of measuring heights
by the sun's shadow.

00:40.939 --> 00:45.376
Let's say, for example, that we're going
to measure the distance of the shadow.

00:45.544 --> 00:49.241
We're gonna take
this measurement here...

00:49.415 --> 00:51.940
...measure the length.

00:53.252 --> 00:56.710
And we're going to multiply that
by the height of the source.

00:56.889 --> 01:00.120
Building height can also be measured
using a clinometer...

01:00.292 --> 01:02.556
...which we're going to make
in class tomorrow.

01:02.728 --> 01:05.925
I've already given you the handout,
but I want to remind...

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:25.584 --> 01:27.279
Hello?

02:18.170 --> 02:20.968
- Please help me.
- Who are you?

02:21.507 --> 02:23.338
I'm Emily.

02:23.542 --> 02:25.635
You know that.

02:26.211 --> 02:27.337
We're family.

02:28.514 --> 02:30.311
Where am I?

02:31.717 --> 02:34.345
This is where it started.

02:36.221 --> 02:38.018
And this is where it has to end.

02:38.190 --> 02:41.455
No. This isn't real.

02:43.061 --> 02:44.187
Help me.

02:44.363 --> 02:46.228
What is similar about these methods...

02:46.398 --> 02:50.494
...is that the right triangles
help give us an accurate measurement.

02:50.669 --> 02:53.035
What are you looking at? Turn around.

02:53.205 --> 02:56.971
That creates
the 45-degree angle between...

03:08.687 --> 03:11.155
- Have you talked to Bonnie?
- No, I'm mad at her.

03:11.323 --> 03:13.883
- She needs to make the first move.
- Be the bigger person.

03:14.059 --> 03:16.619
Ugh, impossible in her presence.

03:16.795 --> 03:20.731
- Why are you so pissed at her anyway?
- She's a thief, that's why.

03:20.899 --> 03:23.732
I gave her my necklace
and she refuses to give it back.

03:23.902 --> 03:27.804
- It's a matter of principle.
- All right, I tried. I'm officially out of it.

03:28.006 --> 03:31.635
Good. Your turn. Where's Stefan?
Have you talked to him?

03:31.810 --> 03:33.801
- He's avoiding me.
- Why?

03:34.413 --> 03:35.437
It's complicated.

03:36.815 --> 03:37.941
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

03:39.551 --> 03:41.576
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:56.668 --> 03:58.101
Good morning, everyone.

04:01.974 --> 04:04.465
Alrighty.

04:04.643 --> 04:06.133
Let's see.

04:09.615 --> 04:10.775
Are you okay?

04:13.452 --> 04:18.548
- ZMAN.

04:19.324 --> 04:21.986
Alaric Saltzman.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.687
It's a mouthful, I know.
It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.

04:25.864 --> 04:28.458
Saltzman is of German origins.

04:28.634 --> 04:31.967
My family immigrated here in 1755
to Texas.

04:32.137 --> 04:34.662
I, however,
was born and raised in Boston.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.334
Now, the name Alaric belongs
to a very dead great-grandfather...

04:39.511 --> 04:41.502
...I will never be able to thank enough.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.807
You'll probably wanna
pronounce it Alaric...

04:43.982 --> 04:47.110
...but it's "Alaric," okay?

04:47.286 --> 04:49.686
So you can call me Rick.

04:50.589 --> 04:52.284
I'm your new history teacher.

04:52.457 --> 04:53.856
Rise and shine.

04:55.093 --> 04:56.492
Gonna be late for school.

04:56.662 --> 04:58.459
What are you...? What are you doing?

04:58.630 --> 05:00.120
Peace offering.

05:01.967 --> 05:04.026
Come on,
you need it for blood circulation.

05:04.202 --> 05:05.294
Does dead flesh good.

05:08.006 --> 05:10.474
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Step aside, please.

05:11.843 --> 05:14.539
I got the town off our back.
It was for the greater good.

05:14.713 --> 05:16.681
But I'm sorry.

05:17.149 --> 05:22.348
And to prove it, I'm not gonna feed
on a human for at least a week.

05:22.521 --> 05:25.547
I'll adopt the Stefan diet.
Only nothing with feathers.

05:25.724 --> 05:29.683
Because I realize that killing your closest
and oldest friend is beyond evil...

05:29.861 --> 05:33.524
...and yet somehow
it's worthy of humor.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.027
- Are you mimicking me?
- Yes, Stefan.

05:37.202 --> 05:40.694
Now that the secret society
of vampire-haters is off our back...

05:40.872 --> 05:45.366
...I can go back to my routine of "how
can I destroy Stefan's life this week?"

05:45.644 --> 05:49.580
And I can go back to sulking
and Elena longing and forehead brooding.

05:49.748 --> 05:51.215
This is fun. I like this.

05:51.383 --> 05:54.113
And I will finally reveal
the ulterior motive...

05:54.286 --> 05:58.347
...behind my evil and diabolical return
to Mystic Falls.

05:58.523 --> 06:00.514
Yeah, I'm done.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.723
This is so like you, Damon.

06:03.895 --> 06:06.022
Always have to have the last word.

06:07.032 --> 06:09.592
Then I ended up
at the remains of old Fell's Church...

06:09.768 --> 06:11.599
...before I woke up back in the woods.

06:11.770 --> 06:14.466
And you always see
your ancestor Emily?

06:14.639 --> 06:15.901
Huh.

06:16.742 --> 06:18.073
Do you believe in ghosts?

06:18.910 --> 06:22.539
- Two weeks ago, I'd say no, but now...
- I think I'm being haunted.

06:24.116 --> 06:25.378
I don't get it. Why Emily?

06:25.550 --> 06:28.451
Grams said she was a powerful witch
in the Civil War days.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.248
This medallion was hers.
It's a witch's talisman.

06:31.423 --> 06:33.414
It all started
when you got the necklace?

06:33.592 --> 06:35.924
I think she's using it
to communicate with me.

06:36.094 --> 06:38.426
- What does Grams say about it?
- I can't call her.

06:38.597 --> 06:41.464
She's gonna tell me to embrace it.
I don't wanna embrace it.

06:41.633 --> 06:42.827
I want it to stop.

06:46.004 --> 06:48.472
Hey, Mr. Saltzman, I'm, uh...
I'm Jeremy Gilbert.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.471
You wanted to see me?

06:53.412 --> 06:58.509
Ahem. You know that your old teacher
had a jackass file?

06:58.717 --> 07:01.185
No joke, it's, um, typed on a label.

07:01.353 --> 07:04.151
It has all the, uh, trouble makers in it.

07:04.322 --> 07:08.588
But really it's just an opus to you.

07:12.497 --> 07:13.964
Don't worry about it.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.591
I'm not him. Clean slate.

07:18.437 --> 07:20.132
Now...

07:21.606 --> 07:22.630
...let's talk grades.

07:22.808 --> 07:26.710
I know, it's been a rough couple months
but I've been trying to turn them around.

07:26.878 --> 07:31.144
Yeah, I saw that, but the problem is
we're halfway through a semester...

07:31.316 --> 07:34.717
...and half of fail is still pretty bleak.

07:34.886 --> 07:37.878
This is the part where you say,
"What can I do to change that?"

07:38.056 --> 07:40.718
I'm glad you asked.
How do you feel about extra credit?

07:40.892 --> 07:44.328
- Yeah, yeah, totally. Whatever.
- Good. Write me a paper then.

07:44.763 --> 07:46.492
- Okay, about what?
- History.

07:46.665 --> 07:50.658
Pick a topic. Keep it local.
No Wikipedia regurgita.

07:50.836 --> 07:52.997
These old towns
have a lot of rich history...

07:53.171 --> 07:57.471
...so just get your hands dirty,
make it sing and you're back on track.

07:59.144 --> 08:01.078
- Deal?
- Uh, yeah, deal.

08:03.048 --> 08:05.573
That's a, uh... That's a cool ring.

08:06.318 --> 08:09.685
Oh, thanks. It was my father's. Heh.

08:09.855 --> 08:14.417
A little garish but family, you know.

08:16.928 --> 08:18.520
You've got a week.

08:20.899 --> 08:22.594
- Ha, ha. Seriously?
- Exactly.

08:23.101 --> 08:25.365
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:25.604 --> 08:27.663
What is that?

08:28.707 --> 08:30.607
- What is what?
- The "hey."

08:30.809 --> 08:33.277
Now it's twice. That is two heys. That...

08:33.445 --> 08:35.743
Do you have any other words
in your vocabulary?

08:35.914 --> 08:38.542
- What's wrong with hey?
- It reeks of awkward subtext.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.183
You spent the night in my bed.

08:40.352 --> 08:44.186
There was cuddling, and then you snuck
out so you wouldn't have to face me.

08:44.356 --> 08:48.019
Which I must say is a total lame-guy
move that I did not appreciate.

08:48.193 --> 08:49.922
And now with the "heys," seriously?

08:50.095 --> 08:54.054
I mean, I may have been some pathetic,
insecure mess after the party...

08:54.232 --> 08:56.700
...but do not mistake that
for me being a pushover.

08:56.868 --> 09:00.133
Because I do not let guys
mess with my head anymore.

09:00.338 --> 09:03.136
I heard your mom
and didn't wanna get you in trouble...

09:03.341 --> 09:04.774
...so I went out the window.

09:04.943 --> 09:07.207
You went out the window.
Another lame-guy move.

09:07.379 --> 09:09.813
Your mom's the sheriff.
And as for the "heys"...

09:09.981 --> 09:13.883
...l'm pretty sure it's what I've said
to you every day since the first grade.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.887
Oh.

09:17.055 --> 09:20.718
Trying to read something into it?
Lame-girl move.

09:33.872 --> 09:36.602
- Hi.
- You weren't in class, I was worried.

09:36.775 --> 09:40.006
Yeah, I got your messages
and I'm sorry I didn't get back to you...

09:40.178 --> 09:43.579
...but what I wanna say
shouldn't be said over the phone.

09:43.748 --> 09:46.740
A simple, "I didn't kill my brother" text
would have sufficed.

09:46.918 --> 09:50.911
I didn't kill my brother,
as much as he deserved it.

09:51.089 --> 09:53.182
He has you to thank for that.

09:53.391 --> 09:54.790
What did you wanna tell me?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.489
I won't be coming to school anymore.

09:58.196 --> 10:00.096
I'm gonna back off
and keep my distance.

10:00.265 --> 10:01.698
It's the right thing to do.

10:02.934 --> 10:07.462
Back off from school? Or from me?

10:14.646 --> 10:16.375
Thank you for telling me.

10:16.548 --> 10:19.142
- It's better this way.
- Yep, I got it.

10:21.152 --> 10:25.612
You're angry, that's good.
Be easier if you hate me.

10:32.564 --> 10:35.294
Okay, it's your last chance.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.492
- I'm gonna scream.
- Oh, no, don't do that.

10:37.669 --> 10:38.829
Let's stay on point.

10:39.004 --> 10:41.700
Listen, I want my necklace.

10:41.873 --> 10:43.204
You can't have it.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.572
I can't take it, but you can give it to me.
I'm trying to help you.

10:46.745 --> 10:49.646
- I don't want your help.
- You do and you don't even know it.

10:49.814 --> 10:52.840
You've stumbled into something
you need to stumble out of.

10:53.018 --> 10:56.181
- Just leave me alone or I swear...
- Nope, no threats.

10:56.354 --> 11:01.758
Look, A, you hurt me last time,
B, I wish you no harm.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.861
Believe it or not, Bonnie,
I wanna protect you.

11:05.030 --> 11:07.021
Let me help you
get Emily off your back.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.659
- How do you know?
- I know a lot of things.

11:10.835 --> 11:12.860
I know more about that crystal
than you do.

11:13.038 --> 11:17.873
And I know that she's using it
to creep inside of you.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.537
Huh? See how scared you are?

11:20.712 --> 11:23.044
You should be,
because I will get that crystal...

11:23.214 --> 11:26.911
...even if I have to wait for Emily
to give it to me herself.

11:27.585 --> 11:32.682
So next time she comes out to play,
you tell her...

11:33.892 --> 11:35.257
...that a deal's a deal.

11:43.134 --> 11:46.365
He's bad news, Elena.
He really scared me.

11:46.538 --> 11:49.405
You need to stay as far away
from Damon as possible.

11:49.607 --> 11:52.201
I'm trying. He just keeps showing up.

11:53.678 --> 11:56.841
I don't want you to be alone.
You're sleeping at my place tonight.

11:57.015 --> 11:59.643
We can make a whole night out of it.

12:04.322 --> 12:05.653
Whoa...!

12:09.194 --> 12:10.422
Where are you going?

12:24.409 --> 12:26.741
- Are you okay?
- Now I am.

12:26.911 --> 12:29.209
All my problems
are because of that thing.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.781
- Can't believe I didn't do that sooner.
- What's your grams gonna say?

12:32.951 --> 12:36.250
Grams isn't the one being haunted
by a 150-year-old ghost, is she?

12:37.388 --> 12:39.549
Okay then.

12:42.727 --> 12:44.786
I like a man who can dine alone.

12:44.963 --> 12:46.225
Quiet strength.

12:46.798 --> 12:49.392
Thought you were still
in that Logan-depression thing.

12:49.567 --> 12:51.194
I've sworn off men forever.

12:51.369 --> 12:53.963
Doesn't mean I can't observe them
from a safe distance.

12:54.172 --> 12:55.969
Well, I can introduce you.

13:02.747 --> 13:04.578
Hey.

13:05.817 --> 13:08.945
Thanks for coming. I wouldn't
have called if it wasn't important.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.917
I know that.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.919
- He threatened her.
- What would Damon want with Bonnie?

13:16.094 --> 13:20.121
She has this necklace. Caroline got it
from Damon and she gave it to Bonnie...

13:20.298 --> 13:21.788
...and now Damon wants it back.

13:21.966 --> 13:23.991
- He's tormenting her.
- Over a necklace.

13:24.202 --> 13:28.104
It's not just any necklace.
It has to do with Bonnie's heritage.

13:28.273 --> 13:32.835
It belonged to one of her ancestors
who lived here during the Civil War...

13:35.513 --> 13:37.981
When you and Damon lived here.

13:38.149 --> 13:40.276
Her name was Emily.

13:40.451 --> 13:43.443
She was Katherine's handmaid,
and a witch.

13:44.422 --> 13:46.322
You know?

13:46.491 --> 13:47.515
About Bonnie?

13:47.725 --> 13:51.684
The first night that you invited me over
for dinner, I made the connection.

13:51.863 --> 13:53.956
And now Damon knows.

13:54.132 --> 13:56.930
And for some reason,
he wants that necklace.

13:57.101 --> 13:58.295
What does it look like?

13:58.870 --> 14:02.533
- It's, um, an antique iron setting with...
- With an amber crystal.

14:02.740 --> 14:06.540
I know it. It belonged to Katherine.
Emily gave it to her which means that...

14:07.512 --> 14:09.275
What?

14:09.881 --> 14:13.510
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Let me talk to Damon.

14:13.685 --> 14:15.448
Will he tell you?

14:18.489 --> 14:20.957
I'll... I'll get it out of him.

14:25.830 --> 14:28.196
- Have you picked a topic?
- No, not yet.

14:28.366 --> 14:30.834
It's gotta be local
and non-lnternet research, so...

14:31.002 --> 14:33.664
- That's easy, you got all your dad's stuff.
- What stuff?

14:33.838 --> 14:36.329
How-the-Gilberts-came-over
on-the-Mayflower stuff.

14:36.507 --> 14:38.338
All that family lineage from way back.

14:38.509 --> 14:41.535
Your dad really loved
all that family-history stuff.

14:41.846 --> 14:44.406
It's all boxed up in the closet.

14:48.353 --> 14:51.652
- Mr. Saltzman.
- Jeremy, what's up, man?

14:51.823 --> 14:55.554
- This is my Aunt Jenna.
- Alaric Saltzman. It's nice to meet you.

14:55.727 --> 14:58.195
Jeremy was just telling me
about his paper.

14:58.363 --> 15:00.160
Thanks for giving him another chance.

15:00.331 --> 15:01.662
Oh, you know, it was my first day.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.824
I wanted to make a good impression.
Ha-ha-ha.

15:07.338 --> 15:09.203
So, Stefan...

15:10.541 --> 15:14.375
...you know, I've been thinking.
I think we should start over.

15:14.545 --> 15:16.445
Give this brother thing another chance.

15:16.614 --> 15:20.380
We used to do it,
oh, so well once upon a time.

15:20.551 --> 15:22.382
I don't, Damon.

15:22.553 --> 15:23.918
I can't trust you to be a nice guy.

15:24.088 --> 15:28.457
You kill everybody and you're so mean.
You're so mean and...

15:29.627 --> 15:33.188
You're really hard to imitate and then
I have to go to that lesser place.

15:33.364 --> 15:36.424
Can I get a coffee, please?
So, what's with the bottle?

15:36.601 --> 15:40.059
I'm on edge. Crash diet. You know,
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

15:40.238 --> 15:44.436
You could just leave, find a new town to
turn into your own personal Gas 'n' Sip.

15:44.609 --> 15:45.701
I'll manage.

15:46.544 --> 15:48.239
Thanks.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.609
You don't have to keep an eye on me.

15:50.782 --> 15:54.149
- I'm not here to keep an eye on you.
- So why are you here?

15:54.352 --> 15:56.115
Why not?

16:12.470 --> 16:14.438
I'm sorry. There, I said it.

16:14.605 --> 16:17.506
If you want the ugly-ass necklace,
keep it.

16:17.675 --> 16:19.734
It's yours.

16:21.079 --> 16:23.377
Will you hate me
if I tell you I threw it away?

16:24.015 --> 16:26.415
- You threw it away?
- I know it sounds crazy.

16:26.584 --> 16:30.281
- The necklace was giving me nightmares.
- You could have given it back to me.

16:30.455 --> 16:32.753
Why? So you could give it back
to Damon?

16:33.391 --> 16:37.452
Screw Damon. Are we doing manicures
or what? Who has their kit?

16:37.628 --> 16:39.528
Mine's in my bag.

16:40.164 --> 16:44.362
So, Elena, how long do you think
this fight with Stefan's gonna last?

16:44.535 --> 16:47.129
Is it like a permanent thing?

16:47.305 --> 16:49.933
I don't know, Caroline.

16:50.908 --> 16:53.342
Why are you such a little liar, Bonnie?

16:53.511 --> 16:54.944
- What?
- Caroline.

17:09.193 --> 17:12.356
- I'm not lying to you, Caroline. I swear.
- It's true.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.363
- I watched her throw it into a field.
- Then explain it.

17:16.233 --> 17:17.701
Emily?

17:17.868 --> 17:19.165
- Who's Emily?
- The ghost.

17:19.637 --> 17:21.366
Oh, the ghost has a name now?

17:21.772 --> 17:24.606
- Caroline, please.
- I wonder why she won't leave me alone.

17:24.776 --> 17:28.075
Okay, what is going on? Why am I
not a part of this conversation?

17:28.246 --> 17:30.043
You guys do this to me all the time.

17:30.214 --> 17:32.512
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

17:33.284 --> 17:36.048
- I can't talk to you, you don't listen.
- That's not true.

17:37.555 --> 17:39.614
- I'm a witch.
- And don't we all know it.

17:39.791 --> 17:43.784
See? That's what I'm talking about.
I'm trying to tell you something.

17:43.961 --> 17:45.394
You don't even hear it.

17:47.865 --> 17:50.561
I listen. When do I not listen?

17:53.037 --> 17:54.595
Jeremy totally ditched me.

17:54.772 --> 17:56.797
- Where'd he go?
- Home.

17:56.974 --> 17:58.566
It's not far. He can walk it.

17:58.743 --> 18:01.041
So are you from here?
Are you a townie?

18:01.212 --> 18:04.613
I'm a returnee.
Left town for a while and now I'm back.

18:04.782 --> 18:06.682
- Why'd you leave?
- School.

18:10.088 --> 18:14.286
- And then there's the real reason.
- Ha-ha-ha. Okay.

18:14.459 --> 18:17.451
I was wronged. Guy named Logan.

18:17.628 --> 18:19.755
- What'd he do?
- The basics.

18:19.931 --> 18:22.456
Lied, cheated, lured me back in,
left me again.

18:24.702 --> 18:28.763
- Your turn. Any sad relationship stories?
- Ha, ha.

18:28.940 --> 18:32.842
The basics. Ahem.
I fell in love, married young...

18:33.611 --> 18:35.272
...wife died.

18:36.047 --> 18:38.379
Oh. Wow.

18:39.717 --> 18:42.743
Yeah. That's always
a good conversation stopper.

18:43.921 --> 18:44.945
What happened?

18:45.123 --> 18:47.591
You, me and the, uh,
North Carolina Police Department...

18:47.758 --> 18:52.593
...are all wondering the same thing.
It's what's known as a cold case.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.634
- So why'd you move here?
- A change of pace, new scenery.

18:59.804 --> 19:03.103
I like it here. It's got a rich history.

19:06.010 --> 19:07.034
Lucky shot.

19:07.245 --> 19:10.180
More like a carefully honed skill
over many decades.

19:12.016 --> 19:15.474
- You're beating me.
- Yeah, because I'm better than you.

19:15.653 --> 19:18.178
I'm onto you. Reverse psychology?

19:18.356 --> 19:20.950
It's a little transparent
but I admire the effort.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.685
You prefer the brooding forehead?

19:23.861 --> 19:26.853
Seriously,
what game do you think you're playing?

19:27.298 --> 19:28.788
That's a funny question...

19:28.966 --> 19:32.902
...considering the fact that
I have been asking you that for months.

19:35.006 --> 19:37.975
- It's frustrating, isn't it?
- Touche.

19:42.914 --> 19:45.007
Bonnie?

19:45.183 --> 19:47.515
Look, it's just not me.

19:47.685 --> 19:51.416
Okay? I don't believe
in the "woo, woo." Heh.

19:54.659 --> 19:57.560
But if you do then, okay, I'm in.

19:57.728 --> 20:00.492
That's all it takes
for me to jump onboard.

20:00.665 --> 20:04.533
Because I consider you
to be my best friend.

20:04.702 --> 20:07.500
And I'm saying this knowing
that Elena's in the kitchen...

20:07.672 --> 20:09.196
...listening to my every word.

20:11.175 --> 20:16.010
Look, I didn't know
how real this was for you.

20:16.180 --> 20:18.580
But I'm listening now.

20:24.422 --> 20:26.413
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:26.591 --> 20:29.116
Elena, you can come in now,
we're done.

20:33.931 --> 20:37.264
Well, there is just way too much drama
in this room.

20:37.435 --> 20:39.335
So, what do you guys wanna do?

20:39.503 --> 20:41.164
Huh! I have an idea.

20:41.339 --> 20:43.739
- Why don't we have a seance?
- Uh...

20:43.908 --> 20:46.035
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Come on.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.734
Let's summon some spirits.

20:47.912 --> 20:50.938
This Emily chick
has some serious explaining to do.

20:57.755 --> 20:58.949
What are we doing?

20:59.123 --> 21:00.385
- I don't know.
- Shh!

21:00.558 --> 21:01.786
Be quiet and concentrate.

21:02.593 --> 21:04.652
Okay, close your eyes.

21:05.896 --> 21:07.761
Okay, now take a deep breath.

21:11.002 --> 21:13.903
Bonnie, call to her.

21:14.805 --> 21:16.602
Emily.

21:16.774 --> 21:18.241
You there?

21:18.809 --> 21:21.300
Really? "Emily, you there?"
That's all you got?

21:21.479 --> 21:24.175
- Come on.
- Fine, jeez.

21:26.484 --> 21:27.576
Emily.

21:29.654 --> 21:31.884
I call on you.

21:32.256 --> 21:35.020
I know you have a message.

21:35.693 --> 21:36.990
I'm here to listen.

21:42.633 --> 21:45.329
- Did that just...?
- Yeah, it just happened.

21:50.508 --> 21:52.635
It's just the air conditioning.

21:53.644 --> 21:55.544
Ask her to show you a sign.

21:55.713 --> 21:57.180
Ask her.

21:57.915 --> 22:02.648
Emily, if you're among us,
show us another sign.

22:08.192 --> 22:10.126
See, it's not working.

22:15.900 --> 22:18.164
No, I can't. I'm done.

22:20.204 --> 22:22.399
Get the light. Please, get the light on.

22:22.573 --> 22:24.541
Hold on, I got it.

22:26.477 --> 22:29.469
You guys, the necklace, it's gone.

22:42.159 --> 22:46.095
- What are we doing here?
- Bonding. Catch.

22:50.935 --> 22:52.368
Mm.

22:52.536 --> 22:56.267
Go on. Give it a try.

22:58.142 --> 23:00.804
Don't forget who taught you
how to play this game.

23:09.987 --> 23:11.045
Ow, that hurts.

23:11.589 --> 23:15.491
Downside of my diet,
getting hit actually hurts a little bit.

23:15.659 --> 23:18.492
Ugh. Whoo.

23:18.662 --> 23:20.892
I'm impressed, Stefan.

23:21.766 --> 23:27.068
Fun with booze and darts,
sentimental with football, and now...

23:27.238 --> 23:29.069
...starry night.

23:33.744 --> 23:35.143
What do you want, Stefan?

23:41.118 --> 23:43.211
It wasn't real, Damon.

23:44.855 --> 23:47.824
- Our love for Katherine.
- Oh, God.

23:47.992 --> 23:50.256
She compelled us.
We didn't have a choice.

23:50.428 --> 23:53.829
Took me years to sort that out,
to truly understand what she did to us.

23:53.998 --> 23:55.295
Oh, no, Stefan.

23:56.333 --> 23:59.302
We are not taking that on tonight.

24:05.142 --> 24:08.043
What do you want
with Katherine's crystal?

24:09.547 --> 24:11.811
How do you know about that?

24:12.383 --> 24:15.079
Come on,
you knew Elena would tell me.

24:17.321 --> 24:21.280
How'd you know it was Katherine's?
Emily gave it to her on her last night.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.950
I was with her and you weren't.

24:26.163 --> 24:30.259
I was the last one to see her, Damon.

24:33.537 --> 24:36.597
Now, what do you want
with Katherine's crystal?

24:39.710 --> 24:42.372
- She didn't tell you?
- We had other things on our mind.

24:46.417 --> 24:49.215
I could rip your heart out
and not think twice about it.

24:49.386 --> 24:50.853
Yeah.

24:51.322 --> 24:52.687
I've heard that before.

24:56.694 --> 24:59.561
I have a bigger surprise, Stefan.

25:04.902 --> 25:06.199
I'm gonna bring her back.

25:12.843 --> 25:15.004
Okay, fun is over, Caroline.

25:15.179 --> 25:17.443
You made a point and I get it.
Now give it back.

25:17.615 --> 25:19.412
What? Well, I didn't take it.

25:22.620 --> 25:24.383
- What What happened?
- I don't know.

25:24.922 --> 25:27.823
Nothing. Jeremy, are you home?

25:36.967 --> 25:38.059
Um...

25:39.103 --> 25:40.263
Guys?

26:00.991 --> 26:02.322
- Oh, my God!
- Bonnie?

26:02.493 --> 26:04.484
- You guys, open the door!
- Bonnie? Bonnie.

26:04.662 --> 26:06.630
- What's going on?
- Bonnie.

26:06.797 --> 26:08.628
- What's happening?
- Try the other door.

26:08.799 --> 26:10.562
- I'll check the hallway.
- Okay.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.594
- Bonnie?
- Please!

26:13.771 --> 26:15.295
- Bonnie!
- Open up the door.

26:15.472 --> 26:18.635
- Bonnie. Bonnie?
- Please open the door!

26:18.809 --> 26:21.141
- Aah!
- Bonnie!

26:21.312 --> 26:24.304
- Aah!
- Bonnie!

26:25.749 --> 26:27.512
Open the door.

26:36.026 --> 26:37.789
What happened? Are you okay?

26:46.170 --> 26:47.660
I'm fine.

26:48.405 --> 26:50.600
Unbelievable.
You were totally faking it.

26:50.774 --> 26:53.641
- Caroline, come on.
- No, you scared the hell out of me.

26:56.914 --> 26:58.677
Bonnie?

26:59.049 --> 27:00.949
I'm fine.

27:01.785 --> 27:03.150
Everything's fine.

27:11.495 --> 27:14.658
- How can you bring Katherine back?
- Before Katherine was killed...

27:14.832 --> 27:16.959
...remember what it was like
in this town?

27:17.134 --> 27:20.467
- I remember the fear and hysteria.
- Townspeople were killing vampires.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.799
When they came for Katherine,
I went to Emily.

27:22.973 --> 27:25.806
Said I'll do anything.
Name your price, just protect her.

27:25.976 --> 27:27.807
She did.

27:28.312 --> 27:30.507
- How?
- She did some spell with the crystal.

27:30.681 --> 27:34.014
While the church was burning,
we thought Katherine was burning in it.

27:34.184 --> 27:36.709
- She wasn't.
- But I saw her go inside.

27:36.887 --> 27:38.718
There's a tomb...

27:38.889 --> 27:42.848
...underneath the church. The spell sealed
Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.

27:43.027 --> 27:46.087
- Katherine's alive?
- Well, if that's what you wanna call it.

27:46.263 --> 27:50.029
She's been trapped in a mystical holding
cell for the last century and a half.

27:50.200 --> 27:54.034
You're an expert on starving a vampire,
so how you think she's doing, Stef?

27:55.606 --> 27:58.837
Did you know that
witches can use celestial events...

27:59.009 --> 28:02.536
...to draw energy into their magic?
Me either.

28:02.980 --> 28:05.244
But in order
to give the crystal its power...

28:05.416 --> 28:08.613
...Emily used the comet
that was passing overhead.

28:08.786 --> 28:11.755
And in order for that crystal
to work again...

28:12.089 --> 28:13.886
The comet had to return.

28:14.058 --> 28:17.050
Downside,
long time in between comets.

28:17.227 --> 28:19.855
And a couple of hiccups along the way
with the crystal.

28:20.030 --> 28:22.726
But the comet passed
and I got the crystal.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.960
Then Caroline got the crystal,
and now Bonnie has the crystal...

28:26.136 --> 28:27.228
...and here we are.

28:27.404 --> 28:29.372
Why would Emily...?
Why would she do this?

28:29.540 --> 28:31.633
She knew they were gonna
come for her too.

28:32.743 --> 28:35.610
And she made me promise
that her lineage would survive.

28:35.779 --> 28:38.247
I remember. You saved her children.

28:38.415 --> 28:41.578
It's the only thing keeping me
from ripping Bonnie's throat out...

28:41.752 --> 28:43.549
...to get my crystal back.

28:43.721 --> 28:45.552
Oh, well. A deal's a deal.

28:46.023 --> 28:48.014
So...

28:48.559 --> 28:50.720
...you wanna go throw some more?

28:51.962 --> 28:54.556
- I can't believe I fell for it.
- Are you okay?

28:54.732 --> 28:56.529
- I must go.
- Lf she's leaving, I'm leaving.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.224
- You can't leave.
- I can.

28:58.402 --> 29:00.734
I've had enough fake witch stuff
for one night.

29:00.904 --> 29:02.804
Thank you for having me.

29:02.973 --> 29:05.806
- I'll take it from here.
- Where are you going?

29:05.976 --> 29:08.467
- Back to where it all began.
- Bonnie.

29:09.079 --> 29:10.546
Bonnie?

29:10.914 --> 29:11.938
Oh, my God.

29:12.616 --> 29:14.243
Emily.

29:14.418 --> 29:17.046
I won't let him have it.
It must be destroyed.

29:19.556 --> 29:21.148
Wait.

29:25.462 --> 29:28.920
- What's happening?
- I don't know. The door, it's not...

29:29.099 --> 29:30.566
- Aah!
- What the hell?

29:35.572 --> 29:36.869
I'm out of here.

29:48.585 --> 29:50.314
- What's wrong?
- It's Bonnie.

29:50.487 --> 29:52.717
- What happened?
- Emily is possessing her.

29:52.890 --> 29:54.721
- She said something.
- What did she say?

29:54.892 --> 29:58.384
She said, "I won't let him have it.
It must be destroyed."

29:58.595 --> 30:01.223
- Then she just left.
- Okay, where do you think she went?

30:01.398 --> 30:02.524
I don't know.

30:04.168 --> 30:06.193
Fell's Church. By the old cemetery.

30:06.370 --> 30:08.736
That's where she took Bonnie
in her dreams.

30:08.906 --> 30:10.703
- We have to help her.
- All right.

30:10.874 --> 30:13.104
Just stay there. I'm gonna go find her.

30:18.482 --> 30:20.643
Hello, Emily.

30:21.418 --> 30:23.113
You look different.

30:24.021 --> 30:25.886
- I won't let you do it.
- We had a deal.

30:26.056 --> 30:29.219
Things are different now.
I need to protect my family.

30:29.393 --> 30:31.918
I protected your family. You owe me.

30:32.129 --> 30:33.892
I know.

30:34.631 --> 30:37.498
- I'm sorry.
- You're about to be a lot more than that.

30:59.223 --> 31:02.522
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're so wrong. I'm much more pathetic.

31:02.693 --> 31:05.856
Oh, no, no, I've got you beat.
I have pathetic down to a science.

31:06.029 --> 31:08.361
Uh, no, we haven't even covered
high school.

31:08.532 --> 31:10.295
Braces. A cup.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.692
Ah. Glasses. Skin condition.

31:19.209 --> 31:21.370
You can, uh...

31:22.512 --> 31:25.345
You know what?
I'm not gonna invite you in.

31:27.217 --> 31:29.845
- Jeremy.
- Well, some other time then.

31:31.054 --> 31:32.919
Have a good night, Jenna.

31:44.568 --> 31:46.229
Oh, uh, you found the boxes.

31:46.403 --> 31:49.099
And I found this too.

31:49.606 --> 31:51.198
Me and Logan.

31:52.843 --> 31:56.108
- That's just cruel.
- No, cruel is dating my history teacher.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.077
I'm not dating him.

31:58.248 --> 32:00.045
- Yet.
- Ha, ha.

32:18.936 --> 32:20.995
- Come on.
- Ugh.

32:21.171 --> 32:23.639
Oh, that hurts. Ugh.

32:23.807 --> 32:25.570
This is why I feed on people.

32:28.078 --> 32:30.171
Stefan.

32:30.747 --> 32:33.511
- Hello, Emily.
- These people don't deserve this.

32:33.684 --> 32:36.346
They should never have to know
such evil.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.578
What do you mean evil?

32:37.754 --> 32:40.518
Emily, I swear to God,
I'll make you regret this.

32:40.691 --> 32:42.921
I won't let you
unleash them into this world.

32:43.093 --> 32:44.822
Them?

32:45.929 --> 32:49.365
- What part of the story did you leave out?
- What does it matter?

32:49.533 --> 32:51.125
Emily, tell me what you did.

32:52.035 --> 32:55.095
To save her, I had to save them.

32:55.272 --> 32:58.503
- You saved everyone in the church?
- With one comes all.

32:58.675 --> 33:01.166
I don't care about them.
I just want Katherine.

33:01.812 --> 33:04.576
I knew I shouldn't have believed
a word out of your mouth.

33:04.748 --> 33:06.181
This isn't about love, is it?

33:06.350 --> 33:09.183
- This is about revenge.
- The two aren't mutually exclusive.

33:09.353 --> 33:10.980
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

33:11.154 --> 33:13.952
They killed 27 people
and they called it a war battle.

33:14.124 --> 33:17.287
- They deserve whatever they get.
- Twenty-seven vampires, Damon.

33:17.461 --> 33:20.624
They were vampires.
You can't just bring them back.

33:22.165 --> 33:25.032
- This town deserves this.
- You're blaming innocent people...

33:25.202 --> 33:27.363
...for something that happened
145 years ago.

33:27.537 --> 33:29.698
There is nothing innocent
about these people.

33:29.873 --> 33:32.501
Don't think it won't happen again.
They know too much.

33:32.676 --> 33:36.077
They'll burn your grand-witch next to us
when they find out. Trust me.

33:36.246 --> 33:38.214
Things are different now.

33:38.448 --> 33:41.212
- Don't do this.
- I can't free them.

33:41.385 --> 33:42.943
I won't.

33:43.153 --> 33:45.144
- No.
- Incendia

33:45.322 --> 33:46.880
No.

33:54.664 --> 33:56.996
No, no, no. Please.

33:57.567 --> 33:58.829
Bonnie.

34:01.104 --> 34:03.038
No!

34:35.505 --> 34:38.838
She's alive, but barely. I can save her.

34:58.261 --> 35:01.253
Her neck. It's healing.

35:20.984 --> 35:23.179
- Hey.
- God.

35:23.353 --> 35:25.685
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, your window was open.

35:25.856 --> 35:27.653
- Thought you should know.
- Not funny.

35:27.824 --> 35:30.987
Look. Earlier today, I lied.

35:31.161 --> 35:33.220
- About?
- About being in bed with you.

35:33.396 --> 35:37.662
- We cuddled, and it creeped me out.
- It creeped you out?

35:37.834 --> 35:40.564
Did you just come over here
to insult me or what?

35:40.737 --> 35:42.671
Because it's been a really long night.

35:42.839 --> 35:44.602
No, it's just that I don't like you.

35:45.942 --> 35:49.673
I never have, but it was nice.

35:51.414 --> 35:54.577
- What?
- Being in bed with you. It felt nice.

35:54.751 --> 35:58.414
And so I was thinking about it
and I thought that I should tell you...

35:58.588 --> 36:02.547
...I stayed the night because you were
all sad and alone and I felt bad for you.

36:04.528 --> 36:07.554
Well, thank you,
because I love being a charity case.

36:07.731 --> 36:11.064
- You can leave now.
- No... Because I know.

36:11.968 --> 36:16.905
With Vicki gone,
and my mom off with Pete whoever...

36:18.208 --> 36:20.403
...it's just me.

36:20.577 --> 36:23.978
So I know.

36:43.800 --> 36:49.796
Katherine never compelled me. I knew
everything, every step of the way.

36:56.179 --> 36:58.306
It was real for me.

37:04.487 --> 37:06.648
I'll leave now.

37:10.093 --> 37:12.823
I don't understand, Elena.
What happened to me?

37:12.996 --> 37:16.329
He attacked me and his face was like...

37:16.499 --> 37:18.967
How do you feel? Are you okay?

37:19.135 --> 37:23.435
I'm fine. It's just this blood, I don't...

37:27.410 --> 37:28.672
I'm not gonna hurt you.

37:30.513 --> 37:31.810
What's going on, Elena?

37:31.982 --> 37:35.440
I'll explain everything, Bonnie, okay?
Let's just get out of here.

37:38.455 --> 37:41.891
Bonnie. Bonnie, look at me. Trust me.

37:42.058 --> 37:43.525
He's not going to hurt you.

37:44.628 --> 37:47.062
Come on. Come on.

37:58.508 --> 38:01.033
- Is she in danger of becoming...?
- No.

38:01.211 --> 38:03.645
No, she has to die with my blood
in her system.

38:04.214 --> 38:07.149
Keep an eye on her tonight,
make sure that nothing happens...

38:07.317 --> 38:09.649
...and once it leaves her system,
she'll be fine.

38:10.553 --> 38:13.021
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

38:15.392 --> 38:17.189
You sure?

38:18.361 --> 38:19.692
I can trust her.

38:20.163 --> 38:23.894
I need someone to know,
someone to talk to. I can't live in secret.

38:24.067 --> 38:28.060
I know that. You shouldn't have to.

38:30.607 --> 38:31.904
You saved her life.

38:36.680 --> 38:41.617
I'm sorry, Stefan. I thought
that I couldn't be with you, but I can.

38:42.052 --> 38:44.486
You don't have to push me away.

38:45.855 --> 38:47.516
I can do this.

38:53.263 --> 38:54.855
I can't.

38:58.802 --> 39:01.202
I have to leave, Elena.

39:02.038 --> 39:05.098
Too many people have died.
Too much has happened.

39:05.275 --> 39:06.606
What?

39:06.776 --> 39:09.210
No. I know
you think you're protecting me...

39:09.379 --> 39:10.403
I have to.

39:11.448 --> 39:13.575
Coming home was...

39:15.118 --> 39:16.210
Was a mistake.

39:16.886 --> 39:19.878
I can't be a part of your life anymore.

39:20.223 --> 39:21.520
Don't go, Stefan.

39:22.759 --> 39:24.124
Please.

39:24.294 --> 39:28.890
You don't have to. This is your home.
Just, please don't go.

39:35.905 --> 39:37.395
Goodbye, Elena.

39:39.142 --> 39:40.973
You're just gonna walk away?

39:41.845 --> 39:43.904
Don't walk away, Stefan.

39:46.349 --> 39:47.577
Stefan.

41:40.363 --> 41:42.729
- Hello, Jenna.
- Logan.

41:45.568 --> 41:47.035
Aren't you gonna invite me in?
