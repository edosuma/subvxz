00:18.900 --> 00:20.800
It's alive!

00:39.387 --> 00:44.222
There's 401 k's, IRAs,
Roth IRAs, retirement funds.

00:44.292 --> 00:45.623
Uh, what is it?

00:47.262 --> 00:49.196
We just fooling with you,
man.

00:49.264 --> 00:50.663
Man, we poor as fuck.

00:50.732 --> 00:54.668
Retirement investing.

00:54.736 --> 00:55.566
Oh, man.

00:55.637 --> 00:56.467
Dumbass!

00:56.538 --> 00:57.436
That ain't happening.

00:57.505 --> 01:00.997
And how did that joke make
you feel?

01:01.075 --> 01:03.202
Before you answer,
look at this joke.

01:03.278 --> 01:08.238
There's 401 k's, IRAs,
Roth IRAs, retirement funds.

01:08.316 --> 01:09.578
Um, what is it?

01:11.553 --> 01:13.418
We just fooling with you,
man.

01:13.488 --> 01:14.978
Man, we poor as fuck.

01:16.691 --> 01:19.182
Retirement investing.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.454
Oh, man.

01:20.528 --> 01:21.722
That ain't happening.

01:21.796 --> 01:25.357
And how did that joke make
you feel?

01:25.433 --> 01:27.458
Are you learning something about
yourself?

01:27.535 --> 01:29.901
Before you answer that,
look at this joke.

01:34.142 --> 01:35.541
Ahhh!

01:35.610 --> 01:37.601
Well, if my calculations are
correct, you have an erection

01:37.679 --> 01:41.137
and regret that you never knew
your great-grandparents.

01:52.293 --> 01:54.727
Oh, my god, save us!

01:54.796 --> 01:56.525
Run for your lives!

01:58.499 --> 02:00.228
No, my pelvis!

02:00.301 --> 02:02.531
Ahhhh!

02:02.604 --> 02:04.071
Damn it, no!
Not that one.

02:04.138 --> 02:05.127
That's the claw.

02:05.206 --> 02:06.833
You don't need the claw.

02:06.908 --> 02:08.568
Okay, ease back on... no!

02:08.643 --> 02:10.804
Don't touch...
No!

02:10.877 --> 02:13.073
Stop!
Okay, don't... hang on!

02:13.147 --> 02:15.172
Go left!
Left, left, left!

02:21.689 --> 02:23.020
I can't believe
we lost the bet

02:23.091 --> 02:25.958
and have to spend the night
in this old haunted house.

02:26.027 --> 02:28.723
That's an oddly complete
summary of our predicament.

02:28.796 --> 02:30.058
Um, we're going this way.

02:30.131 --> 02:34.033
Yeah, to hide the pickle in
the hair sandwich.

02:34.102 --> 02:36.468
That just means they won't
get into heaven.

02:36.537 --> 02:39.199
Well, I guess I'll go find an
empty room to masturbate in.

02:39.274 --> 02:41.105
Sweet.

02:41.175 --> 02:42.836
Look at me.

02:42.910 --> 02:44.207
I'm fall out boy.

02:48.716 --> 02:51.844
Oh, Dean,
you're the coolest.

02:51.919 --> 02:53.648
Whoa!

02:53.721 --> 02:54.710
Dean?

02:56.557 --> 02:57.387
Dean?!

02:57.458 --> 02:58.618
I've got to get help.

03:02.363 --> 03:03.557
Rape ghost.

03:03.631 --> 03:04.563
What?

03:04.632 --> 03:06.657
Rape ghost!

03:07.669 --> 03:08.795
Maybe there's an
old medical book

03:08.870 --> 03:11.236
with pictures of
boobs in it.

03:11.306 --> 03:12.898
Ah!

03:12.974 --> 03:14.532
What?
Hey!

03:14.609 --> 03:15.974
Oh, oh, oh!

03:16.044 --> 03:18.535
R- r-r-r-rape ghost!

03:19.714 --> 03:21.545
It stole my black cherry.

03:21.616 --> 03:23.379
Oh, my god.
Where's Tina?

03:23.451 --> 03:28.286
Gee, I hope the rape ghost
doesn't get me.

03:29.157 --> 03:30.681
Oh.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.398
What's better than roses
on your piano?

03:42.470 --> 03:44.836
Tulips on your organ.

03:47.008 --> 03:48.305
Toodles.

03:48.376 --> 03:50.071
Come back anytime.

03:50.144 --> 03:51.304
Even me?

03:51.379 --> 03:53.540
Ew, no!

04:03.624 --> 04:04.613
Timber!

04:07.161 --> 04:10.255
Why, someone left this job
half done.

04:10.331 --> 04:11.855
Can we fix it?

04:11.933 --> 04:13.298
Yes, we can!

04:13.368 --> 04:16.132
Ain't nobody finishing
nothing.

04:16.204 --> 04:17.831
I'm sorry, who are you?

04:17.904 --> 04:20.031
We're from the Union,
and we say

04:20.108 --> 04:23.077
you don't have the right
equipment for this job.

04:23.144 --> 04:25.374
We have all the equipment we
need.

04:25.446 --> 04:26.276
Really?

04:26.347 --> 04:27.837
You got a talking briefcase

04:27.915 --> 04:29.815
full of hundred-dollar bills
over there?

04:29.884 --> 04:31.909
No, but... oh, okay.

04:31.986 --> 04:33.977
That's, you know... oh, whoa!
Hey!

04:34.055 --> 04:36.023
Ha ha ha!
Can I play, too?

04:36.090 --> 04:37.318
Sure, asshole.

04:37.392 --> 04:39.917
Hope you like smelling what you
ate.

04:46.901 --> 04:48.061
Spud!

04:48.136 --> 04:50.263
Don't forget to wear
your safety goggles.

04:50.338 --> 04:51.498
Oh, thanks, Bob.

04:55.009 --> 04:58.001
Whew! Rock and roll!

04:59.313 --> 05:01.178
Oh! Oh! Oh!

05:01.249 --> 05:03.649
Ahh!

05:03.718 --> 05:06.380
Now dig these mother fuckers
a grave, Scoop.

05:06.454 --> 05:08.081
No prob, Bob.

05:17.165 --> 05:20.692
Ew, New Jersey smells
like bad tuna.

05:20.768 --> 05:22.065
Can we go home?

05:22.136 --> 05:23.797
All:
Yes, we can!

05:23.871 --> 05:25.498
Yay!

05:28.009 --> 05:30.341
So, as you can see, it's 200
square feet,

05:30.411 --> 05:33.039
new carpeting,
tons of space under the bed,

05:33.114 --> 05:34.706
and the boy scares easy.

05:34.782 --> 05:37.114
Does he...
does he wet the bed?

05:37.185 --> 05:38.550
Like a faucet.

05:38.619 --> 05:39.449
I love it.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.782
We love it.

05:40.855 --> 05:44.347
My name is Sonny, and I'm
cuckoo for cocoa puffs.

05:44.425 --> 05:46.120
All:
Hi, Sonny.

05:46.194 --> 05:50.130
Yep, never married, never had
kids, but I've got my train set.

05:50.198 --> 05:52.291
All aboard.

05:52.366 --> 05:53.628
Whoo-whoo!

05:53.701 --> 05:56.295
Next stop, Lonelyville.

05:57.972 --> 05:58.904
Whoo-whoo!

05:58.973 --> 06:02.238
Ha ha. Lucky?
You bet.

06:02.310 --> 06:03.971
Whoo-whoo!

06:06.781 --> 06:08.772
What's wrong, Cowboy Curtis?

06:08.850 --> 06:13.150
I just found out I have
cancer.

06:17.425 --> 06:19.416
That's our secret word
of the day.

06:19.494 --> 06:21.462
Pee-wee, Pee-wee, seriously.

06:21.529 --> 06:23.019
He said it's malignant.

06:23.097 --> 06:24.428
What's malignant?

06:24.499 --> 06:25.761
The cancer.

06:27.802 --> 06:31.397
Experience military combat
like never before.

06:31.472 --> 06:35.704
This is "Inside the Battlefield
- The Weather Dominator."

06:35.776 --> 06:40.543
September 10, 1984...
mother nature was on the rag.

06:43.284 --> 06:46.344
Was it merely her time of the
month?

06:46.420 --> 06:49.912
Bow before Cobra and my weather
dominator,

06:49.991 --> 06:53.552
or I'll crank
up the humidity so high

06:53.628 --> 06:56.825
no ass crack will ever be dry
again.

06:56.898 --> 06:59.059
An eternity of swamp ass.

07:01.335 --> 07:04.065
My gosh, that could send oil
prices skyrocketing.

07:04.138 --> 07:07.505
Can you imagine gasoline for
over $1 a gallon?

07:07.575 --> 07:11.136
G.I. Joe, the nation's elite
anti-terrorist task force

07:11.212 --> 07:13.806
with the nation's least
oppressive dress code,

07:13.881 --> 07:15.212
leapt into action.

07:15.283 --> 07:18.946
Almost immediately, two top Joes
were captured and forced

07:19.020 --> 07:20.920
to dual in
the Cobra Sportatorium

07:20.988 --> 07:23.855
in a desperate bid to drive
concession sales.

07:23.925 --> 07:25.722
That was crazy.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.090
Imagine if the nazis had
captured Eisenhower

07:27.161 --> 07:29.527
and put the war on pause so they
could watch him

07:29.597 --> 07:32.065
fight a mute dude in a ninja
outfit.

07:32.133 --> 07:33.896
No offense, Snake Eyes.

07:33.968 --> 07:38.462
Oh, great, the Etch-a-Sketch.

07:38.539 --> 07:39.938
I can't even read that.

07:40.007 --> 07:42.976
Much like Britney Spears'
fragile psyche,

07:43.044 --> 07:45.512
the weather dominator was split
into three fragments

07:45.580 --> 07:47.741
and scattered around
the Earth.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.305
Which was kind of a shocker.

07:49.383 --> 07:51.510
The complexity of a weather
dominator...

07:51.586 --> 07:53.611
you'd think more than three
pieces, but no.

07:53.688 --> 07:55.713
Destro, how did that make you
feel?

07:55.790 --> 07:56.779
Like this.

07:58.893 --> 08:01.760
Thus was launched a
three-fronted battle,

08:01.829 --> 08:03.922
engaged first on
the Island of No Return...

08:03.998 --> 08:05.192
today a Sandals resort.

08:05.266 --> 08:07.496
I signed up to travel the
world, pay for college,

08:07.568 --> 08:08.967
and shoot lasers at guys in
masks,

08:09.036 --> 08:10.731
which had always been
a dream of mine.

08:10.805 --> 08:13.330
Then I heard we were going to
The Island of No Return.

08:13.407 --> 08:17.275
I mean, who the fuck sends a
19-year-old kid to...

08:19.480 --> 08:21.004
I mean fuck man.

08:21.082 --> 08:24.313
Some attempting to return
from The Island of No Return

08:24.385 --> 08:26.148
would find returning difficult.

08:26.220 --> 08:27.482
My dearest Clara,

08:27.555 --> 08:29.853
this is our fourth day on
The Island of No Return.

08:29.924 --> 08:32.756
We've been circling around,
looking for an ion correlater.

08:32.827 --> 08:36.422
...to stop Cobra from compiling
their weather dominator.

08:36.496 --> 08:39.830
Food is scarce,
and morale is low.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.799
Blam.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.427
I never understood
that last part.

08:43.504 --> 08:46.098
That last part was Morrie
getting shot.

08:46.173 --> 08:47.834
Oh, that makes sense now.

08:47.908 --> 08:48.738
Oh!

08:48.809 --> 08:51.004
Oh, Morrie!

08:51.078 --> 08:53.740
Next, the fight for the
hydromaster fragment

08:53.814 --> 08:55.645
erupted in another remote locale

08:55.716 --> 08:57.149
the Palace of Doom.

08:57.218 --> 09:00.654
Otherwise known as my
mother-in-law's house.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.449
I kid, but seriously, don't
marry jewish.

09:04.525 --> 09:07.790
Zartan, we're late for
Seder.

09:07.862 --> 09:08.794
Kill me.

09:08.863 --> 09:11.195
Meanwhile, the battle for the
final fragment

09:11.265 --> 09:13.563
led to an
impromptu hockey game.

09:18.005 --> 09:21.031
Tthat was the most fun I ever
had as a Joe.

09:21.108 --> 09:22.905
It was pretty hilarious.

09:22.977 --> 09:25.377
We should have all been
court-martialed.

09:25.446 --> 09:28.279
Firing lasers at the last
piece of the weather dominator

09:28.349 --> 09:29.680
worth billions of dollars...

09:29.750 --> 09:32.685
Whoa, Cobra Commander would have
had our nuts for that.

09:32.753 --> 09:34.118
And speaking of nuts...

09:34.188 --> 09:36.588
So cold, shrinkage on an epic
scale.

09:36.657 --> 09:39.490
Oh-ho, my scrotum was like
the size of a walnut.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.891
I think my testicles

09:40.961 --> 09:43.327
might have actually retracted
into my body.

09:43.397 --> 09:44.955
It was like reverse puberty.

09:45.032 --> 09:46.590
I was quite comfortable.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.794
A last-ditch assault on the
Cobra stronghold

09:48.869 --> 09:50.996
decided the
final outcome.

09:51.072 --> 09:53.905
G.I. Joe had emphatically
planted an American flag

09:53.974 --> 09:56.966
in Cobra's ass... both
metaphorically and,

09:57.044 --> 09:59.205
in one unfortunate case,
quite literally.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.612
We flew in, beat them like
mixed-race stepchildren,

10:01.682 --> 10:03.980
and Cobra Commander went to
prison.

10:04.051 --> 10:05.712
And he promptly escaped.

10:05.786 --> 10:09.051
Whew, boy, the other countries
of the world were pissed.

10:09.123 --> 10:10.715
They wanted him put to death
immediately,

10:10.791 --> 10:12.452
but we kind of
dragged our heels,

10:12.526 --> 10:14.926
and by that time, Zartan had
busted him out

10:14.995 --> 10:17.987
with a wicker-basket thing and a
remote-control snake

10:18.065 --> 10:19.396
or something.

10:19.467 --> 10:21.230
Oh, good times.

10:21.302 --> 10:22.291
Good times.

10:25.139 --> 10:27.437
Oh, for god sakes, just stop it.

10:27.508 --> 10:29.840
