00:13.012 --> 00:16.808
Folks are blessed who make
the best of every day

00:19.143 --> 00:22.562
Living by
their own philosophy

00:25.565 --> 00:29.944
Everyone beneath the sun
must find a way

00:31.863 --> 00:36.533
And I have found
the only way for me

00:40.662 --> 00:45.709
I don't believe in
frettin' and grievin'

00:45.792 --> 00:49.003
Why mess around with strife

00:50.296 --> 00:55.509
I never was cut out
to step and strut out

00:55.676 --> 00:58.846
Give me the simple life

01:00.556 --> 01:05.810
Some find it pleasant
dining on pheasant

01:05.894 --> 01:09.522
Those things
roll off my knife

01:10.940 --> 01:16.654
Just serve me tomatoes
and mashed potatoes

01:16.737 --> 01:19.531
Give me the simple life

01:21.283 --> 01:25.078
A cottage small
is all I'm after

01:26.579 --> 01:30.041
Not one that's spacious
and wide

01:31.542 --> 01:35.463
A house that rings
with joy and laughter

01:36.755 --> 01:40.509
And the one you love
in sight

01:41.968 --> 01:44.471
Some like the high road

01:44.554 --> 01:47.474
I like the low road

01:47.599 --> 01:52.019
Free from the care
and strife

01:52.144 --> 01:57.274
Sounds corny and seedy
But, yes, indeedy

01:57.399 --> 02:01.194
I like the simple life

02:23.298 --> 02:28.303
Life could be thrilling
with one who's willing

02:28.344 --> 02:31.722
To be a farmer's wife

02:33.182 --> 02:38.687
Kids calling me Pappy
would sure make me happy

02:38.812 --> 02:42.149
Give me the simple life

02:43.775 --> 02:48.947
Some find it pleasant
dining on pheasant

02:49.072 --> 02:52.283
Those things
roll off my knife

02:54.118 --> 02:59.248
Just serve me tomatoes
and mashed potatoes

02:59.331 --> 03:03.293
Give me the simple life

03:27.524 --> 03:29.776
Nina, come on. They're gonna
be here any minute.

03:29.859 --> 03:32.820
Okay. We'll be right down.

03:44.748 --> 03:46.624
Father of the bride.

03:46.666 --> 03:49.585
I never thought I'd say this, but that
whole experience Pas a piece of cake...

03:49.627 --> 03:53.339
compared to the roller coaster
I've been on this past year.

03:53.422 --> 03:55.549
I admit it took me a while
to recover from the wedding,

03:55.716 --> 04:01.054
but eventually life got back
to normal, which is exactly
the way I prefer life to be.

04:01.179 --> 04:05.850
After the dust settled, I began
to realize what a lucky guy I was.

04:05.975 --> 04:08.853
I had a wonderful home
filled with memories,

04:08.978 --> 04:10.980
and completely paid for;

04:11.063 --> 04:14.358
a wife I love just as much
as the day I married her;

04:14.483 --> 04:17.569
a daughter, independent,
self-sufficient,

04:17.653 --> 04:20.113
married, working, happy;

04:20.239 --> 04:22.824
a son blossoming
in the middle of middle school;

04:22.866 --> 04:25.410
and a son-in-law
gainfully employed,

04:25.493 --> 04:29.038
and very often,
out of town on business.

04:29.122 --> 04:31.499
Life was sweet.

04:31.624 --> 04:35.377
I felt for the first time
ahead of the game.

04:35.503 --> 04:37.421
Then it dawned on me.

04:37.546 --> 04:41.133
I was a mere five years
away from freedom.

04:41.258 --> 04:44.970
Soon I'd be a father with one kid
married and the other off in college.

04:45.095 --> 04:47.388
And that started me
thinking.

04:47.472 --> 04:50.641
What was I gonna do
with all that free time?

04:52.643 --> 04:55.396
Anything I wanted.

04:55.521 --> 04:58.273
Maybe I'd take up
fly-fishing,

04:58.357 --> 05:01.818
travel to exotic places,
climb Mount Everest.

05:01.943 --> 05:05.113
I was feeling
on top of the world.

05:05.238 --> 05:09.284
And that's when
they lowered the boom on me.

05:09.409 --> 05:13.663
It was like that old joke:
''All those who think they have
it made, take one step forward.

05:13.788 --> 05:17.207
Not so fast, George Banks.''

05:17.291 --> 05:19.751
It was about a year ago
when it all started.

05:21.128 --> 05:25.590
Well, nine months ago
to be exact.

05:29.969 --> 05:33.139
I was on my way home from work
on a perfect fall day.

05:35.182 --> 05:37.434
The leaves were golden.
The air was crisp.

05:37.518 --> 05:40.604
And I couldn't help thinking
what a charmed life I was leading.

05:42.814 --> 05:46.109
Yep, I was a happy man.

06:06.002 --> 06:08.338
Hey, hey!

06:08.421 --> 06:11.299
- Hey, Dad, you hear the news?
- What news?

06:11.382 --> 06:13.509
- I don't know. She wouldn't tell me.
- Matty, phone!

06:13.676 --> 06:16.720
- Got it!
- Who wouldn't tell you?

06:18.305 --> 06:20.724
- Hey.
- Hi, George.

06:20.849 --> 06:22.726
Do you think it's
what we think it is?

06:22.851 --> 06:24.978
What? What? What is it?
Somebody tell me what's going on.

06:25.103 --> 06:27.063
Bryan called and said
to be here at 6:00 sharp,

06:27.188 --> 06:30.316
that he and Annie have
some important news to tell us.

06:31.901 --> 06:35.821
This is one of those moments,
George. I can feel it.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.823
Oh, my.

06:41.159 --> 06:45.997
Hi, honey. Oh, don't worry,
okay? I'm sure nothing's wrong.

06:46.122 --> 06:47.999
- How do you know?
- Well, I, I know.

06:48.124 --> 06:50.543
- Oh, you know?
- No. I don't-- I don't really know.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.629
I just know nothing's wrong.
Now, come on. Come on inside.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.798
- Can I fix you a drink, George?
- No, thanks.

06:55.881 --> 06:58.175
Nina, you don't think Annie's
been transferred back East, do you?

06:58.258 --> 07:02.679
No, honey. Something tells me
this has nothing to do with work.

07:02.763 --> 07:05.640
George. George. You sure
you don't want a glass of wine?

07:05.724 --> 07:07.684
'Cause she always said
a transfer was a possibility.

07:07.725 --> 07:09.686
And I, for one,
would hate it if they moved.

07:09.811 --> 07:12.647
Really, George? You?

07:12.772 --> 07:14.690
Well, they live
far enough away as it is.

07:14.732 --> 07:16.233
Dad, they live
a mile from here.

07:16.317 --> 07:18.152
Well, you know, with
the traffic and everything.

07:18.318 --> 07:22.697
Oh, there they are. I just--
I just don't wanna hear
the word ''Boston,'' that's all.

07:22.823 --> 07:24.699
I mean, you know what's
gonna happen, don't you?

07:24.783 --> 07:26.785
First, they're gonna promise
to come home for long weekends.

07:26.910 --> 07:31.289
Then it'll be a week every other summer.
Next thing you know, we're strangers.

07:31.414 --> 07:34.083
We're just names on
a Christmas card list.

07:34.208 --> 07:38.545
We'll be those relatives
out in California.

07:38.629 --> 07:41.423
Bummer Man, he delivers.

07:41.465 --> 07:43.383
- Hello?
- We're here.

07:43.466 --> 07:46.553
- Hi!
- Hello!
- Hi!

07:46.678 --> 07:48.972
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

07:49.138 --> 07:51.182
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, son.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.436
There she was, my Annie.

07:55.561 --> 07:59.356
Every time I saw her, I had to remind
myself she was a married woman.

07:59.481 --> 08:03.485
To me, she still seemed
like a kid playing house.

08:05.779 --> 08:08.072
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, hon.

08:08.198 --> 08:09.574
- How are you?
- Good!

08:09.699 --> 08:11.450
Are you feeling all right?

08:11.576 --> 08:15.246
Of course she's feeling all right.
Look at her. She never looked better.

08:15.371 --> 08:19.791
- Hi, Dad.
- Are you okay?
- I was a little late.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.169
So, any news at work?
Any-- Any news? Any anything?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.588
- No, everything's great.
Same, but good.
- Same.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.048
- Busy.
- Busy.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.466
See?

08:28.633 --> 08:29.842
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.969
George. Sorry, George.

08:32.094 --> 08:36.223
As long as the big news wasn't that
my daughter was moving 3,000 miles away,

08:36.307 --> 08:39.893
her husband could call me
anything he wanted.

08:39.977 --> 08:45.023
In spite of myself, I had
actually begun to grow somewhat
fond of Bryan MacKenzie.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.152
Those hors d'oeuvres
look so great. I'm starving.

08:51.529 --> 08:53.364
Mm-hmm.

08:53.489 --> 08:56.075
So what is it, Annie?
What's the news?

08:56.158 --> 08:59.203
- Well, don't you wanna eat first?
- Come on. Tell us. What is it?

08:59.286 --> 09:01.455
- I know what it is.
I got it. I'm positive.
- What?

09:01.538 --> 09:04.457
You bought a house, right? A place
you can remodel a little closer to home?

09:04.624 --> 09:07.335
- A house? Is that it?
- Well--

09:07.460 --> 09:09.295
Well, no, no, no, no.
A house is fine.

09:09.462 --> 09:11.923
Oh, yeah, of course,
a-- a house is definitely good.

09:12.006 --> 09:15.718
That's the big news? A house? Man, I
thought you guys were gonna have a baby.

09:17.344 --> 09:20.180
- Oh, get outta here.
- Us too.

09:20.305 --> 09:22.349
I know. Me too.
That's what I thought.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.559
That's what
we were hoping for.

09:24.643 --> 09:27.270
- Well--
- Tell 'em.

09:29.522 --> 09:31.858
Your wish came true.
I'm gonna have a baby!

09:31.899 --> 09:33.693
- We're pregnant!
- Oh!

09:44.828 --> 09:49.123
- Congratulations.
- Oh, this is so--
- Thanks.

09:51.542 --> 09:54.378
I never liked
that Bryan MacKenzie.

09:54.503 --> 09:57.673
Not from the moment
I laid eyes on him.

09:57.756 --> 10:01.468
Here my little girl was playing house,
and he had the nerve to--

10:01.551 --> 10:05.972
- George.
- What do you say, Dad?

10:07.223 --> 10:09.600
Congratulations.

10:09.684 --> 10:11.602
You too.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.863
Congratulations.

10:22.946 --> 10:25.949
- Oh!
- Grandpa!

10:26.074 --> 10:31.329
''Grandpa''? First that runt
steals my daughter, now he
makes a grandpa out of me.

10:35.749 --> 10:39.836
The baby is due July 26, and I like that
'cause that's a good even number.

10:39.962 --> 10:42.172
Of course, it is
going to be very hot.

10:42.255 --> 10:46.718
But I'm sure she's not
gonna mind. Oh, God. Oh, George.

10:46.760 --> 10:52.056
Can you believe the same doctor
who delivered Annie is going
to be delivering her baby?

10:52.098 --> 10:55.226
- Oh, honey. It's so amazing.
- Yeah.

10:55.309 --> 10:58.979
Oh, George!
I have a great idea.

10:59.104 --> 11:02.566
What if Franck did
the baby shower for us?

11:02.691 --> 11:06.277
- Franck?
- As a favor, honey. George.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.947
What? I thought
you liked Franck now.

11:08.988 --> 11:11.574
- I never actually said
I liked the man.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

11:11.657 --> 11:13.701
When we were at that party
with those people from whatcha-callit,

11:13.826 --> 11:15.744
- you were just raving on about him.
- All right. Well, maybe it slipped out,

11:15.786 --> 11:17.162
but I didn't mean it.

11:17.287 --> 11:19.373
Nina, get a grip.
I'm not gonna go into hock...

11:19.456 --> 11:20.666
to give Annie a baby shower.

11:20.791 --> 11:22.375
I just finished
paying for the wedding.

11:22.417 --> 11:25.587
Oh, now my stomach hurts.
Where'd you put my Tums?

11:25.670 --> 11:29.465
All right, honey. Okay. Okay, okay.
It was just a thought. Calm down.

11:29.590 --> 11:32.134
What's the matter with you anyway?
You didn't say a word during dinner.

11:32.260 --> 11:35.596
- You're acting as if
you're not happy about this.
- Who's acting?

11:35.721 --> 11:39.892
Oh, I see. You're not happy that your
daughter is going to be having a baby?

11:39.975 --> 11:43.478
That's right, Grandma.
I'm not.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.898
- Why?
- Well, for starters,
they can't afford a baby.

11:46.981 --> 11:48.524
- Oh! Oh.
- Babies cost money.

11:48.650 --> 11:50.610
And the older they get,
the more they cost.

11:50.735 --> 11:53.112
I mean, they didn't plan for this.
They don't have a nest egg.

11:53.195 --> 11:54.572
They-- They
barely have a nest.

11:54.697 --> 11:57.825
How are they gonna fit a baby
into that shoe box they live in?

11:57.908 --> 12:01.286
Really, George. They have more money
than we had at their age.

12:01.411 --> 12:03.955
Also, what do they know
about raising a kid?

12:04.080 --> 12:09.043
Annie's just a kid herself. I
mean, she graduates college and
marries the first guy she meets.

12:09.168 --> 12:11.921
And now to get saddled with a baby
even before her career takes off.

12:12.004 --> 12:14.632
Why must I always be the only
feminist in this family?

12:14.757 --> 12:16.634
You know, I just
realized something.

12:16.759 --> 12:19.052
I'm four-foot-six.
I don't shave.

12:19.136 --> 12:22.055
I don't have a job,
and I'm gonna be an uncle.

12:22.180 --> 12:25.850
Is there somethin'
weird about that?

12:25.892 --> 12:29.062
Finally, someone
who thinks like I do.

12:29.187 --> 12:30.938
Oh, yeah,
a 12 year old.

12:35.317 --> 12:37.569
Hello? Oh. Sally!

12:37.695 --> 12:41.198
Oh, Sally, hi. I have
the best news. Guess what.

12:41.323 --> 12:44.409
This is so exciting.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.911
I'm gonna be a grandmother.

12:47.036 --> 12:50.123
- Poor Nina. The woman was
obviously living in denial.
- Yeah. I know.

12:50.206 --> 12:52.833
- I, for one, wasn't ready
to be a grandfather.
- I know. Yeah.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.877
What was so grand
about it anyway?

12:54.960 --> 12:57.546
George? Oh, he's thrilled.

12:57.713 --> 13:00.674
- Grandfathers wore
cardigans and hearing aids.
- In fact, um, I was just
telling him that...

13:00.799 --> 13:02.759
-I wore baseball caps and running shoes.
-the same doctor who delivered Annie--

13:02.884 --> 13:06.971
Sure I may have been a little
out of shape, but I was still young.

13:07.096 --> 13:09.390
And I could prove it.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.613
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

13:25.739 --> 13:29.367
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

13:29.450 --> 13:32.036
Oh, yeah! Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

13:32.161 --> 13:33.663
- Whoa.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

13:33.871 --> 13:36.790
You better
take it easy there, Pops.

13:41.378 --> 13:43.380
Oh! Ow!

14:07.193 --> 14:09.278
Oh, hang on a second.

14:09.445 --> 14:11.322
- You got the list?
- I got it right here. Are you okay?

14:11.447 --> 14:13.074
- Yeah, I'm fine. Shoot.
- Okay.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.743
- The following men are older than you:
- Go.

14:15.784 --> 14:17.870
- Paul McCartney;
- Yeah.
- Rod Stewart;
- Yeah.

14:17.911 --> 14:19.329
- Jack Nicholson.
- Jack Nicholson?

14:19.454 --> 14:21.748
Oh, by eight years.
You're much younger than Jack Nicholson.

14:21.832 --> 14:24.084
Well, you can't get any cooler than Jack
Nicholson. That's a good one. Go on.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.461
- Okay. Mick Jagger;
- Yeah.
- Robert Redford.
- Really?

14:26.586 --> 14:29.130
-Mm-hmm. Bob Dylan; Warren
Beatty; and Bill Clinton.
-Really?

14:29.213 --> 14:32.925
- But only by 31 days.
- Hey, younger is younger.

14:34.885 --> 14:36.804
- Oh, when the saints
- Hi. Here's what I'm thinkin'.

14:36.929 --> 14:38.472
- Go marchin' in
- I wanna look younger.

14:38.597 --> 14:40.057
- You know, I think maybe
something, you know, in here.
- Oh, when the

14:40.140 --> 14:42.642
- Saints go marchin' in
- Like the hair, it's really too square.

14:42.768 --> 14:44.519
- I'm just kind of-- you know.
- I want to be

14:44.644 --> 14:47.272
- A little stickied up,
you know. Kinda hip!
- In their number

14:47.313 --> 14:51.317
- Easy.
- When the saints go marchin' in

14:52.526 --> 14:56.655
Oh, when the sun
refuse to shine

14:56.822 --> 15:01.618
Oh, when the sun
refuse to shine

15:01.743 --> 15:05.914
I still wants to be
in their number

15:05.997 --> 15:09.417
- When the sun refuse to shine
- Young, right?
- Oh, totally.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.128
- It's bitchin'.
- Oh, when the saints

15:12.295 --> 15:14.296
- Go marchin' in
- Bitchin'.

15:14.422 --> 15:18.717
Oh, when the saints
go marchin' in

15:18.801 --> 15:22.971
I'm going to sing
as loud as thunder

15:23.138 --> 15:28.184
Oh, when the saints
go marchin' in

15:31.312 --> 15:33.272
Hi.

15:38.944 --> 15:41.154
Hi.

15:41.822 --> 15:43.823
Well, hi.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.510
At last

16:09.430 --> 16:13.893
My love has come along

16:17.688 --> 16:21.066
My lonely days

16:21.191 --> 16:23.068
Are over

16:26.071 --> 16:30.074
And life is like a song

16:33.911 --> 16:36.705
Oh, yeah, yeah

16:36.747 --> 16:39.166
At last

16:42.210 --> 16:47.132
- The skies above are blue
- Oh! George. George!

16:47.257 --> 16:49.717
- George, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.428
- Oh! Oh, George.
- Hey, what do you think?
Can you tell the difference?

16:52.511 --> 16:55.181
Can I tell the difference? What
did you do? ls it-- Is it permanent?

16:55.306 --> 16:57.725
It is if you want it to be. The new,
permanent, young and improved...

16:57.766 --> 17:00.269
- and stronger, I might add,
George Stanley Banks.
- I

17:00.435 --> 17:02.938
- I love you
- I look like the guy
you married, right?

17:03.063 --> 17:05.857
- Kind of.
- Hey, don't kid yourself.

17:05.940 --> 17:08.026
It makes you look
younger too, you know?

17:08.109 --> 17:12.029
- Hey, where's Matty?
- Matty's eating at Cameron's.

17:12.113 --> 17:15.115
Huh. All alone. Hmm.

17:15.241 --> 17:19.328
Just you and me
at the old house.

17:19.453 --> 17:24.499
- May I ask you what
possessed you to do this?
- To call my own

17:24.624 --> 17:27.919
- I found a thrill
- Just wanna look the way
I feel, that's all.

17:27.961 --> 17:29.379
- Oh. What?
- Ava loved it.

17:29.420 --> 17:32.340
- Who's Ava?
- Oh, just the girl
who did it, that's all.

17:32.381 --> 17:34.884
She said it took years
off my face.

17:35.009 --> 17:36.927
You know, Nina,
you're very beautiful.

17:36.969 --> 17:39.513
- Oh. George.
- You are so very beautiful.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.722
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:40.764 --> 17:43.975
Thank you, honey. Oh!

17:44.100 --> 17:47.061
- My. What's in the bag?
- Oh!

17:47.187 --> 17:50.398
I got you something totally great.
I found it at Victoria's Secret.

17:50.481 --> 17:54.318
- Oh, God, George.
- I opened a charge
for you there, by the way.

17:54.402 --> 17:57.279
Huh? What-- What are you--
Are you crazy, honey?

17:57.321 --> 18:01.616
-I'm not-- I'm not wearing that.
I am a grandmother, okay? I--
-You're-- You're--

18:01.700 --> 18:04.160
- You're not my grandmother, are you?
- No.

18:04.244 --> 18:07.705
- For you are mine
- Well, George, what's
gotten into you, honey?

18:07.830 --> 18:11.334
Hey, can't a man make love
to his wife without something
having gotten into him?

18:11.375 --> 18:15.462
Well, what do you mean,
make love?

18:15.546 --> 18:18.340
What do you think I mean?
Hmm?

18:22.677 --> 18:27.557
My, my, my. This is
a new and improved George Banks.

18:51.537 --> 18:54.123
Hey, hey, hey. Didn't we just pay
900 bucks to have this roof fixed?

18:54.290 --> 18:56.792
I swear to God, this house
is starting to fall apart.

18:56.917 --> 19:01.254
First, the heating went, then the gas
thing broke and the plumbing froze.

19:01.338 --> 19:05.091
I don't know, sometimes I, I
think I would just like to wash
my hands of this whole thing.

19:05.216 --> 19:07.969
George, what is it?
What-- What are you thinking?

19:08.052 --> 19:11.514
- I have a brilliant,
beyond-brilliant idea.
- Uh, yeah?

19:11.597 --> 19:14.767
- I say we sell this dump.
- Right.

19:14.850 --> 19:16.852
- I'm serious.
- George, what? Are you crazy?

19:17.019 --> 19:18.937
Honey, last year you said
you wanted to be buried in the backyard.

19:19.021 --> 19:21.231
Now you're telling me
you wanna sell the place?

19:21.231 --> 19:24.192
Nina, listen. Matty's
in school every day 'til 6:00.

19:24.192 --> 19:26.486
You're at work. I'm at work.
You know, let's get rid of it.

19:26.653 --> 19:30.823
Let's not be so by-the-book,
you know. Let's-- Let's be
adventurous. Let's loosen up.

19:30.865 --> 19:34.368
I don't know. I mean,
if we sold the place, then
we won't have room for the baby.

19:34.452 --> 19:38.247
What ''we,'' kemo sabe?
It's not our baby. lt doesn't
need its own room in our house.

19:38.414 --> 19:41.792
- Well, what about Matty?
- Oh, like Matty wouldn't
love living at the beach?

19:41.917 --> 19:45.587
The-- Oh! The beach?
Mr. Sunscreen?

19:45.712 --> 19:48.172
Please, George. I mean,
now you wanna live at the beach?

19:48.339 --> 19:51.300
Hey, you're the one who always
said that one day before you're
old you wanna live by the ocean.

19:51.384 --> 19:53.761
- I know, but--
- I'm telling you,
this, this leak is an omen.

19:53.886 --> 19:55.721
You know, we could sell
this place in a second.

19:55.846 --> 19:58.265
I mean, it's the Leave It To Beaver
house that everybody wants.

19:58.432 --> 20:01.435
You know, we'd have enough money to buy
a condo. You know, we could get a boat.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.062
We could travel. And I could get
that Harley I always wanted.

20:04.229 --> 20:08.358
Harley? Honey. Oh, George. This
has been a very big day for you.

20:08.441 --> 20:13.279
First your hair,
and then this, uh, thing.

20:13.404 --> 20:16.991
I just-- I think we should
think about things, okay?

20:17.074 --> 20:19.076
Okay. But will you
think about it, really?

20:19.159 --> 20:22.913
- Well, will you wash that stuff
out of your hair, really?
- Yeah.

20:23.038 --> 20:24.623
Okay, I'll make ya a deal.

20:24.789 --> 20:26.666
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

20:26.791 --> 20:29.419
If one more thing goes wrong with
this house, we'll put it up for sale.

20:29.460 --> 20:32.046
You have my word on it.

20:36.508 --> 20:39.469
As luck would have it, termites
attacked two weeks later.

20:42.681 --> 20:46.810
So we decided to give it a test run,
see if we got any nibbles.

20:51.189 --> 20:53.983
Four weeks went by
and not a single nibble.

20:54.150 --> 20:56.568
All right, here we go.
Here we go. Here.

20:56.652 --> 20:59.196
- Check.
- Ball in. Come on. Let's go.

20:59.321 --> 21:00.781
What are you doing? What are
you doing? Hey! Where you going?

21:00.906 --> 21:03.408
- Spin move.
- Whoa! Hey! What? Hey!

21:03.533 --> 21:05.452
- Come on. No. No!
- Yes!

21:05.493 --> 21:09.831
Then one Saturday morning,
we got a bite. A big bite.

21:11.707 --> 21:14.502
George, I'd like you
to meet Mr. and Mrs. Habib.

21:14.668 --> 21:18.005
Hello. How do you do? Nice to
meet you. This is my son Matty
and his friend Justin.

21:18.088 --> 21:22.092
- We like house very much.
When you can move out?
- Excuse me?

21:22.259 --> 21:25.512
The Habibs would like to buy
the house, George. It's exactly
what they've been looking for.

21:25.637 --> 21:28.723
Yes, when you can move? We need
house a week from Wednesday.

21:28.806 --> 21:31.475
And my wife wants
flower dishes in kitchen.

21:31.601 --> 21:36.480
- You sell, we pay top dollar.
- For the house, top dollar?

21:36.563 --> 21:41.610
Dishes. For the dishes. For the house,
we pay what you ask and no more.

21:41.693 --> 21:45.322
But we need house a week
from Wednesday or no deal.

21:45.322 --> 21:50.034
Gee, that's, uh-- That's ten days
from now. That's kinda quick.

21:50.201 --> 21:52.286
We've lived here 18 years.
I don't know if we can get every--

21:58.542 --> 22:00.419
Excuse, please?

22:03.713 --> 22:08.885
Uh, you explain that I pay big money
if he sell now. Very big bonus.

22:10.553 --> 22:13.639
Mr. Habib is willing
to pay a generous bonus...

22:13.681 --> 22:16.934
for whatever inconvenience moving
too quickly may cause you, George.

22:17.101 --> 22:19.061
Dad, you better
discuss this with Mom.

22:24.190 --> 22:26.276
- How generous?
- Would, uh,

22:26.401 --> 22:30.279
$15,000 be generous enough?

22:30.405 --> 22:33.783
- We may be making real estate
history here, George.
- Oh, yeah.

22:34.867 --> 22:38.203
One, two,

22:38.328 --> 22:40.247
three thousand,

22:40.330 --> 22:44.125
four, five, six,

22:44.251 --> 22:46.836
seven thousand--

22:46.920 --> 22:51.048
I shook the man's hand and
promised to be out in ten days.

22:54.802 --> 22:57.471
Careful with the dishes.

22:57.513 --> 23:01.516
Only problem was, I didn't
have the nerve to tell Nina.

23:01.683 --> 23:06.229
Wonderful champagne, George.
Dom Perignon. What are we celebrating?

23:06.312 --> 23:10.066
I know. That's what I was wondering.
What are we celebrating, dear?

23:10.149 --> 23:14.278
Well, it's just the first time
the whole family's been together
since the baby and everything.

23:14.403 --> 23:17.948
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Oh, honey.
- Thanks, Dad. That's sweet.

23:18.115 --> 23:19.366
Oh.

23:19.491 --> 23:22.828
So tell us, have you thought of
any names for the baby yet?

23:22.911 --> 23:28.124
Well, if it's a boy, we like
Cody, Cooper, Riley or Wyatt.

23:28.249 --> 23:31.544
- Wyatt? As in Earp?
- Yeah.

23:31.586 --> 23:34.713
- Y-You don't like it, Dad?
- Well, I like it better than Cooper.

23:34.839 --> 23:36.757
- Or Riley.
- Hey, what if it's a girl?

23:36.924 --> 23:39.885
For a girl,
our favorite name is Chloe.

23:39.927 --> 23:43.430
- Chloe? Ooh.
- Chloe? It's not even American.

23:43.471 --> 23:47.267
Th-Thank you, Matthew. We realize that.
We-- We also like Phoebe and Sophie.

23:47.433 --> 23:49.310
And we're still debating
between Lucy and Fanny.

23:49.435 --> 23:51.270
Y-You're not considering
any family names?

23:51.437 --> 23:55.900
Yes, isn't the first son supposed to be
named after the paternal grandfather?

23:55.983 --> 24:00.070
Well, he doesn't have to be named John,
of course. Any name on my side will do.

24:00.237 --> 24:03.406
We have an Andrew in the family.
A Melville. A Jacob.

24:03.532 --> 24:06.159
Uh, Jake is a great name.

24:06.284 --> 24:09.412
Hey, you know what. They don't need any
more suggestions. Their list is fine.

24:09.495 --> 24:13.791
You're absolutely right, George.
Anything is fine as long
as it goes with MacKenzie.

24:13.874 --> 24:17.419
Uh, wait a minute. I thought the
baby's last name was gonna be
Banks-MacKenzie with a hyphen.

24:17.461 --> 24:19.254
- Wasn't that the deal?
- Would you like to go through life...

24:19.338 --> 24:21.256
with the name
Cooper Banks-MacKenzie?

24:21.340 --> 24:22.924
Kid's gonna sound
like a law firm.

24:23.049 --> 24:25.468
It's an awfully long
last name, George.

24:25.468 --> 24:28.388
Hold on. What are we saying?
You're not gonna hyphenate the
last name? When did this happen?

24:28.513 --> 24:30.431
Nothing's been decided yet, Dad.
It's just that...

24:30.473 --> 24:33.392
we think two last names is a lot
for a little kid to deal with.

24:33.517 --> 24:35.811
And since neither of us
want to forfeit our names,

24:35.936 --> 24:38.772
we've been coming up
with alternative last names.

24:38.897 --> 24:41.817
Your baby's gonna have an alternative
last name? Like, what, Smith or Jones?

24:41.983 --> 24:44.944
- No.
- No, because you can't
make Smith or Jones from
the letters of our last names.

24:45.111 --> 24:47.197
- Right.
- So--
- I don't understand.
What names can you make?

24:47.238 --> 24:50.825
Well, the ones we like best
are Zineman, Zenkman and Mannis.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.660
Oh, my.

24:52.743 --> 24:56.080
Are you telling me I might have
a granddaughter named Sophie Zenkman?

24:56.205 --> 24:59.458
- Yeah.
- Look, look. I have
a simple solution here.

24:59.583 --> 25:03.378
George, Nina. You already have
Matty to carry on the family name.

25:03.420 --> 25:07.215
So, why don't we drop this
Banks-MacKenzie business and...

25:07.298 --> 25:09.842
just go with MacKenzie?

25:09.884 --> 25:13.888
- Or drop the MacKenzie.
- Oh, well, now wouldn't that be silly?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.307
Well, I don't think that's any
sillier than dropping the Banks.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.975
- Well, I would venture
to suggest that MacKenzie...
- Well, I do.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.560
- is a good, solid family name.
- I mean, traditionally, you take--

25:19.643 --> 25:22.687
I mean, the baby's just as much
a Banks as it is a MacKenzie, isn't it?

25:22.813 --> 25:25.940
- Traditionally--
- Dad, say something.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.151
- I just don't agree with that.
- Change the subject.

25:28.192 --> 25:30.695
- MacKenzie is--
- Hey, guess what.
I sold the house today.

25:32.488 --> 25:34.657
- What did you say, dear?
- Nina, I forgot to tell you.

25:34.698 --> 25:37.993
While you were at the market
this morning, I sold the house.

25:38.035 --> 25:40.662
Well, congratulations, Gramps.
Where are you movin'?

25:40.787 --> 25:44.666
Well, we don't know exactly for
sure where yet, but, uh, we're
thinking of maybe the beach.

25:44.791 --> 25:46.918
- We don't know exactly
for sure where yet?
- What?

25:47.043 --> 25:49.504
But, George, we haven't
even started looking.

25:49.545 --> 25:52.214
You sold the house? Dad.

25:52.298 --> 25:54.842
- Why is she crying?
- Well, because I never thought...

25:54.967 --> 25:57.970
they were serious
about selling the house.

25:58.095 --> 26:01.848
I'm sorry, Dad, but I just thought it
was another goofy idea like your hair.

26:01.932 --> 26:04.184
- Hey.
- I never thought you were
actually gonna go through with it.

26:04.267 --> 26:08.229
- I love this house.
- Well, wow!

26:08.396 --> 26:10.523
I guess I just assumed
we'd have a little more warning.

26:10.690 --> 26:14.610
But what do we have?
We have at least 90 days before
we have to move. Am I right, George?

26:14.735 --> 26:18.072
Oh, believe me, Nina, you can jack up
an escrow six months, if you need to.

26:18.238 --> 26:21.158
- Matty, what's going on?
- May I be excused?

26:21.283 --> 26:25.537
No. No, sir.
You may not be excused.

26:25.620 --> 26:28.915
- George!
- The guy paid me $15,000 extra
to be out in ten days.

26:28.998 --> 26:32.501
The guy paid you $15,000 extra
to be out of the house in ten days?

26:32.585 --> 26:35.296
- I hope you took it, George.
- He did.

26:35.462 --> 26:39.716
- And he threw in Mom's favorite
dishes just to close the deal.
- George!

26:56.649 --> 26:59.735
Nina was less than thrilled
about our abbreviated escrow.

26:59.776 --> 27:02.487
But being the great woman
that she is, she went with the flow...

27:02.571 --> 27:07.450
and even allowed me back into
our bedroom for our last night
at 24 Maple Drive.

27:07.575 --> 27:11.370
And since we had nowhere to
live, she also arranged for us
to stay at the MacKenzie's...

27:11.495 --> 27:13.998
- while they took a Caribbean cruise.
- Honey.

27:14.081 --> 27:17.876
Honey, are you sure you don't
want me to take your picture by
your favorite part of the fence?

27:18.001 --> 27:20.629
No, no, I'm fine.

27:20.712 --> 27:25.008
Oh, okay-- Oh. Whoa.

27:25.008 --> 27:27.552
Hey, Nina, are you okay?
I mean, you don't look so good.

27:27.719 --> 27:29.637
I know. I don't
really feel so good.

27:29.846 --> 27:32.974
I-I just didn't think I'd get
so emotional about this whole thing.

27:33.099 --> 27:35.017
I don't know.
I feel kind of dizzy.

27:35.100 --> 27:38.896
You guys, these are from the tree
that we carved our initials...

27:39.021 --> 27:41.189
- in out back.
- Oh!

27:41.356 --> 27:43.233
- Here. Here.
- Oh!

27:43.358 --> 27:45.193
Oh, Mom, did you get
a picture of the tree?

27:45.360 --> 27:48.029
- Oh, just a roll, honey.
- Okay.

27:48.112 --> 27:51.449
- Oh.
- Hey, Matty, what's that?
- My doorknob.

27:51.574 --> 27:54.577
I want to keep a memento
from my room.

27:54.702 --> 27:55.911
- Oh!
- Oh!

27:56.036 --> 27:58.372
Hey, what are we,
the Schmaltz family?

27:58.539 --> 28:02.250
Come on. No more tears.
We're on to bigger and better things.

28:02.375 --> 28:06.087
I mean, who needs
this old shack? Look at it.

28:13.260 --> 28:16.347
Dad, there's one more thing
we have to do before we go.

28:16.430 --> 28:18.515
I'm not gonna dig up
that parakeet from the backyard.

28:18.682 --> 28:20.559
That's not
what I was thinking.

28:24.062 --> 28:26.731
How many times do you think
we've played out here?

28:26.898 --> 28:29.192
About a thousand.

28:31.569 --> 28:35.489
- I remember our very first game.
- Me too.

28:44.914 --> 28:48.042
- I remember you were four.
- Here you go. Here you go.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.086
You had a red ribbon
tied in your hair.

28:57.509 --> 28:58.886
Dad!

29:00.721 --> 29:02.973
Look, Dad,
I can dribble. Watch.

29:03.098 --> 29:06.017
That's my girl.
That's my girl.

29:06.101 --> 29:07.393
Hey.

30:02.777 --> 30:05.280
Sorry to interrupt.

30:05.321 --> 30:06.573
Oh, uh, hi.

30:09.492 --> 30:12.328
- You got the key, George?
- Yeah, I-- Uh, I have it right here.

30:12.453 --> 30:16.165
Uh. I got it.
I know I have it.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.625
Oh, uh, Mr. Habib,
this is my daughter Annie.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.211
Uh, she had her wedding here
at this house.

30:21.336 --> 30:23.505
Ah, yes. The key?

30:23.588 --> 30:26.382
Oh, yeah. I got it.
Somewhere.

30:26.424 --> 30:29.510
Did I give that to you?
Ah, okay. Oh, sorry.

30:31.679 --> 30:35.933
So, well, here you are.
And, uh, here you go.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.644
- She's all yours.
- Good luck, Banks.

30:38.811 --> 30:41.563
Uh, you too.

30:55.075 --> 30:56.994
Well.

31:01.915 --> 31:04.626
- Ah, what perfect timing. We were
just about to depart ourselves.
- Hi, Nina.

31:04.668 --> 31:06.961
- Are you-- Are you in a hurry?
- Oh, not at all. No.
We have plenty of time.

31:07.170 --> 31:08.630
- Oh, thanks so much.
- Welcome. Come on in.

31:08.713 --> 31:10.673
- Oh, it's our pleasure.
- Welcome. Welcome.
Make yourselves at home.

31:10.715 --> 31:12.633
- Come in, please.
- Are you sure?
- Where's Matty?

31:12.758 --> 31:14.009
- Oh, he's sleeping at a friend's.
- I'll tell you what. The dog food's...

31:14.093 --> 31:15.344
- all in the refrigerator and marked.
- That's nice.

31:15.511 --> 31:18.097
- Uh, uh, you remember
the dogs, of course?
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:21.224 --> 31:24.144
- Fortunately, they forgot you.
- Oh.

31:24.311 --> 31:26.479
Come here, you angels.

31:31.025 --> 31:33.027
I'm gonna miss you guys.

31:33.110 --> 31:35.446
- See, George? They're
completely harmless.
- Mm-hmm.

31:35.487 --> 31:37.990
Get ahold of yourself. Now, listen,
I want you to pay attention...

31:38.073 --> 31:41.535
to your Uncle George and
your Aunt Nina now, all right?

31:41.576 --> 31:43.787
Bye, fellows.

31:43.870 --> 31:47.373
Oh, all right.
One more kiss, you maniac.

31:52.253 --> 31:55.422
- John!
- Wow.
- All right.

31:55.548 --> 31:58.258
- We're off.
- Well, good-bye.
- Oh! Oh.

31:58.383 --> 32:00.302
- Oh, well.
- That's what the limo was for.

32:00.385 --> 32:02.679
- Help yourself to anything
you see. We'll call you.
- Got the tickets, honey?

32:02.762 --> 32:04.306
- They're all yours.
- Thanks.
- Okay, bye-bye.

32:04.472 --> 32:06.391
- Enjoy.
- Thanks so much.
- I've got everything, sweetheart.

32:06.433 --> 32:09.894
And when you get through with
that limo, send it back for us.

32:12.938 --> 32:15.524
Oh. Oh, George.

32:15.608 --> 32:19.778
Honey, do something.
They look sad.

32:19.903 --> 32:22.072
Hey, guys.
Don't worry about a thing.

32:22.239 --> 32:25.617
- Uncle George is here--
- Oh, George.

32:25.742 --> 32:29.203
All right. Now, just take it easy, guys.
He's not gonna hurt you.

32:29.328 --> 32:32.373
- Cute. Cute.
- Well, as it turned out,
the dogs did remember me.

32:32.498 --> 32:35.084
Hey, puppy, puppy, puppy.

32:35.125 --> 32:40.881
It was going to be a long night.
Just the four of us
in the old MacKenzie mansion.

32:41.006 --> 32:44.301
Hey, listen to this. Luxury
beach condo. Marina views.

32:44.467 --> 32:48.012
Stroll along winding streams
past lush landscaped gardens.

32:48.054 --> 32:51.349
Honey, are you sure you didn't
pack the Pepto-Bismol?

32:51.432 --> 32:53.351
Why? You still feel sick?

32:53.476 --> 32:56.270
I can't seem to shake this thing.
I just don't feel right.

32:56.312 --> 32:59.731
You just need a good night's sleep.
That's all. Tomorrow--

33:02.776 --> 33:04.778
- Oh.
- Tell 'em to get off.

33:04.861 --> 33:08.656
Okay, come on, guys.
Get off. Let's go. Off.

33:08.656 --> 33:11.450
Come on. Off.
Come-- Oh, forget it.

33:11.617 --> 33:14.954
I gotta-- I gotta lay down.
Just come on. Let's move over.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.457
That's a good dog. Oh!

33:18.457 --> 33:20.917
What am I supposed to do?
Sleep standing up?

33:21.001 --> 33:22.961
I don't know, honey.
Just push 'em off.

33:23.086 --> 33:26.089
All right, boys. Hey, come on, come on.
Now, now, fun's over. Let's go.

33:26.214 --> 33:28.132
Come on. Get off the bed.
Off the bed. Now, come on.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.093
Come on. I-I don't
wanna have to get tough.

33:30.218 --> 33:33.512
So just come on. Let's go!
I mean it. Amscray!

33:33.596 --> 33:36.098
Off the bed! Come on! Off!

33:38.350 --> 33:41.686
- Oh.
- Get your filthy paw
off my wife, you good--

33:45.982 --> 33:48.067
Oh, forget about it. It's their house.
Let 'em have the bed.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.236
I'll-- I'll go stay in one
of the other seven bedrooms.

33:50.403 --> 33:54.949
Oh, but, honey, I don't
wanna be left alone in this
big room. I don't feel good.

33:54.990 --> 33:57.284
Fine. I-I'll sleep
on the floor. Huh?

33:57.451 --> 33:59.828
Thanks.

34:03.165 --> 34:07.585
Oh, I know. I have an idea.
What if after they fall asleep,
you just lift them off?

34:07.710 --> 34:12.048
Oh, yeah, of course. I'll just
lift 'em off. What are you, nuts?

34:12.214 --> 34:14.091
- Could you hand me a pillow?
- Yep.

34:44.869 --> 34:46.830
Oh, I'm so naive.

34:46.955 --> 34:49.916
Oh, I know
what's wrong with me.

34:49.999 --> 34:51.918
What? What's
wrong with you?

34:52.043 --> 34:54.837
It's so obvious. I don't know
why I didn't realize it before.

34:55.004 --> 34:58.799
Honey, I'm going
through menopause.

34:58.966 --> 35:04.220
Oh, Nina. You can't be going
through menopause. My mother
went through menopause.

35:04.346 --> 35:06.931
Well, exactly,
and probably at my age.

35:07.098 --> 35:09.392
George, I have
all the symptoms.

35:09.434 --> 35:12.895
I'm late. I'm weepy all
the time. I'm hot and dizzy.

35:13.020 --> 35:16.565
- Don't be silly. We're still so--
- But, George, honey, we're not.

35:16.607 --> 35:18.650
We're not as young
as you think we are.

35:18.734 --> 35:22.446
Just because we're getting
older, it doesn't mean that
we're old. This is the '90s.

35:22.529 --> 35:26.324
Growing old isn't what
it used to be. Well, it's true.

35:26.449 --> 35:30.703
Women my age are doing Geritol ads
and Fixodent commercials.

35:30.870 --> 35:33.998
- Nina.
- They are.

35:34.123 --> 35:37.668
And guess who I saw on
the cover of Longevity magazine.

35:37.793 --> 35:40.712
- Guess.
- Barbara Bush.

35:40.754 --> 35:42.839
Peggy Lipton.

35:46.426 --> 35:48.636
From The Mod Squad?

35:48.720 --> 35:52.890
This is reality, George.
Do me a favor, will ya, honey?

35:53.015 --> 35:55.768
Stop acting like
this isn't happening.

35:55.809 --> 35:59.146
- Oh, do I have to?
- Yes! Yes.

36:01.732 --> 36:06.653
George. George. You haven't been
the same since the day you
found out Annie was pregnant.

36:06.778 --> 36:11.157
Now, I know you, and I know it takes you
a long time to work these things out.

36:11.324 --> 36:15.119
- But I miss the old George.
- Must you use that word?

36:15.286 --> 36:19.414
All right. I miss the adorable
George Banks I used to be married to.

36:19.540 --> 36:23.960
Honey, you got me worried. I don't know.
You dyed your hair. You sold our house.

36:24.002 --> 36:26.629
- What's next, a 19-year-old girlfriend?
- Nina!

36:26.671 --> 36:28.756
Well, men do those kinds
of things, George.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.968
They don't wanna grow old with their
wives, so they get-- I don't know.

36:33.135 --> 36:36.347
New wives. Young wives.
Just--

36:37.598 --> 36:41.601
- Nina.
- What, honey?

36:41.768 --> 36:46.356
- What?
- I may dye my hair, and I may
wanna move to the beach and...

36:46.481 --> 36:49.442
- Yeah?
- I may hate the idea that
I'm gonna be a grandfather,

36:49.567 --> 36:53.070
but never for one millisecond
of one day...

36:53.154 --> 36:55.739
did I ever not wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

36:55.823 --> 36:58.784
- Really?
- Really.
- Really?

36:58.909 --> 37:02.579
And I'm sorry
I've been such a jerk.

37:02.704 --> 37:08.167
- Oh, that's okay. I'm used to it.
- Yeah.

37:08.251 --> 37:10.169
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:16.008 --> 37:18.677
The doctor didn't give you
any indication of why
he wanted me to come with you?

37:18.844 --> 37:21.138
-No.
-But he didn't say there was
anything to be concerned about?

37:21.263 --> 37:23.723
No. I mean, I assume this is
absolutely routine. I don't know, honey.

37:23.890 --> 37:26.476
I've never been through
menopause before, you know.

37:26.643 --> 37:29.479
He probably just wants to tell us
what to expect un-- well, unless--

37:29.604 --> 37:32.064
- Unless what? What? Unless what? What?
- Well, unless...

37:32.106 --> 37:36.026
something showed up on my
blood test that was too horrible
to tell me over the phone,

37:36.110 --> 37:38.654
and he wanted you here for
support in case I flipped out.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.697
- You know, and he just, like--
- Nina, well, what did
the man say exact--

37:40.781 --> 37:43.909
- Well--
- What were his words?
- Just that...

37:43.950 --> 37:47.078
he thought it would be wise for us
to come in together as soon as possible.

37:47.245 --> 37:49.163
That's all.
Okay, here we are, honey.

37:49.288 --> 37:53.793
I'm sure I'm gonna be fine.
I hope.

37:53.959 --> 37:56.754
I'd never seen Nina
so unglued.

37:56.879 --> 37:59.923
I wasn't used to being
the calm one.

38:00.048 --> 38:02.092
I didn't know what the doctor
was about to tell us.

38:02.134 --> 38:07.931
But nothing, absolutely nothing,
could've prepared me for what
I was about to hear.

38:08.014 --> 38:10.391
- It's gonna be all right.
- I know.

38:12.435 --> 38:15.729
Nina, George.

38:19.608 --> 38:23.945
- Well, we ran a panel on Nina's blood.
- Nina.

38:24.070 --> 38:27.156
- What?
- Whatever it is, I just want
you to know I'm here for you.

38:27.156 --> 38:28.408
- And you can count on me.
- Okay.

38:28.491 --> 38:30.118
We're gonna get
through this together.

38:30.159 --> 38:31.619
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:31.702 --> 38:36.957
So, uh, tell us. Uh, what is it?
We can handle it.

38:37.124 --> 38:40.627
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.383
Nothing that won't go away
in nine months.

38:47.467 --> 38:50.052
Kids, you're gonna
have a baby.

38:59.853 --> 39:02.481
- Excuse me?
- Nina's pregnant.

39:02.564 --> 39:05.316
- Oh, my God.
- Pregnant?

39:08.736 --> 39:12.156
- And who, may I ask, is the father?
- George!

39:12.239 --> 39:14.450
Don't ''George'' me,
you two-timing Mata Hari.

39:14.492 --> 39:16.452
I swear, we haven't
done it in six weeks.

39:16.577 --> 39:19.329
I haven't just felt myself
lately, but pregnant?

39:19.371 --> 39:21.248
How could this happen,
Nina Dickerson?

39:21.415 --> 39:24.167
Why are you calling me
by my maiden name, you big jerk?

39:24.250 --> 39:27.545
And, what do you mean we haven't
done it in six weeks? What about
that little escapade in the kitchen?

39:27.712 --> 39:31.674
Oh, please. That was
a stupid nothing. I mean, that
was a moment of pure insanity.

39:31.757 --> 39:33.843
Would you like to know
how many moments of pure insanity...

39:33.968 --> 39:36.804
I've delivered
over the last 20 years?

39:36.929 --> 39:40.432
Phil, look at me.
I'm about to be a grandfather.

39:40.557 --> 39:43.268
Things like this
do not happen to men my age.

39:43.393 --> 39:46.229
Come on! Picasso had children
well into his seventies.

39:46.354 --> 39:48.481
Ah, well, you know, Picasso.
I mean, Picasso.

39:48.731 --> 39:51.275
I mean, there-- He's the one guy in
history who had kids into his seventies.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.986
But, you know, he's an artist.
He can do anything he wants.

39:54.028 --> 39:56.280
I'm just-- You know,
I'm just a, a regular Joe.

39:56.447 --> 39:59.575
You know, regular Joes don't
have, have babies at my age!

39:59.658 --> 40:03.203
You know, I was-- I was just
adjusting to being a grandfather!

40:03.370 --> 40:05.497
Preg--

40:05.538 --> 40:07.624
Oh! Oh, my God!

40:07.749 --> 40:12.295
- All right. Here you go, Mr. Banks.
- Oh, I'm all right.
- George?

40:12.420 --> 40:14.505
- Now, wait a minute.
- Here. Let me help. I'll help.
- I'm okay.

40:14.547 --> 40:17.466
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
- Let's see if you got
your sea legs back yet.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.509
- Sorry about that. I'm just, uh--
- The shock.

40:19.593 --> 40:21.887
- I know.
- Anyway, thank you.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.389
- Uh-huh. Bye-bye.
- Thank you.
- I know, honey. Me too.

40:24.431 --> 40:29.060
I just-- God. I can't
believe it, huh? Yikes!

40:29.227 --> 40:32.563
Well, you don't think he could be like,
you know, wrong or something, do you?

40:32.605 --> 40:36.775
I don't think he used a
home pregnancy test, George. No.

40:36.817 --> 40:40.904
Honey, this is definitely like
I'm-- This is happening, George.

40:40.988 --> 40:44.824
I know it's a lot to deal with,
but we'll just-- we'll just
let it sink in, all right?

40:44.949 --> 40:48.244
- Good idea.
- Okay. Mom's the word, huh?

40:48.369 --> 40:50.371
Did she say,
''Mom's the word''?

40:50.496 --> 40:53.707
Oh, man. This was a life curve
I was not ready for.

40:53.791 --> 40:58.003
''Grandmother Has Baby.'' It was like
a National Enquirer headline.

40:58.128 --> 41:02.507
One would have thought nothing on earth
could have topped this moment.

41:02.591 --> 41:05.719
- Wrong again.
- It's the musk oil smell
that scares me.

41:05.802 --> 41:07.762
- Oh, well.
- Oh!

41:07.804 --> 41:09.430
- Oh, my God, the Banks!
- Oh, my gosh.

41:09.514 --> 41:12.600
And my favorite
father of the bride.

41:12.642 --> 41:14.560
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello!

41:14.685 --> 41:16.645
- Great. Wonderful. You
look wonderful. Mr. Banks.
- Oh. Look at you!

41:16.770 --> 41:19.189
- Chop, chop, chop.
Oh, you look beautiful.
- How are you, sir?

41:19.273 --> 41:23.735
Imagine running into you here of all
places. This is our home away from home.

41:23.777 --> 41:28.114
Well, I am always fixing, you know.
A nip, a tuck, a little suction.

41:28.156 --> 41:30.867
You know, I look in the mirror
and I say, ''Hello. Looking sad.''

41:31.075 --> 41:34.703
So I come down here, I valet
park, and bongo, Cher Bono.

41:34.829 --> 41:37.831
So how 'bout you? Nothing is wrong,
I hopes? Your health is good?

41:37.998 --> 41:40.083
- Oh, yeah, yeah. We're--
We're good. We're perfect.
- Oh, yeah, it's good. It's great.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.043
- We're healthy and,
uh, nothing to report.
- Very healthy.

41:42.169 --> 41:44.087
- Nothing at all.
- Great.
- Oh, well.

41:44.129 --> 41:45.547
- Oh.
- Mrs. Banks.

41:45.630 --> 41:47.757
- Huh?
- You forgot your prenatal vitamins...

41:47.882 --> 41:50.510
and all your pamphlets
on becoming a mommy again...

41:50.676 --> 41:52.595
- and the ultrasound photo.
- Oh.

41:52.762 --> 41:55.055
Your baby's first picture.

41:55.222 --> 41:57.725
- Oh, no.
- Baby's first picture? Don't--

41:57.850 --> 42:01.937
- Don't tell me you are pregnant?
- No?
- Yeah. I am.

42:01.978 --> 42:03.980
- Oh, my God!
- I know. I just found out.

42:04.064 --> 42:09.652
Oh, I love that so much! Mother of
the bride and a mommy! Get out of town!

42:09.694 --> 42:12.530
- Oh, mazeltov, Mrs. Banks!
- And guess what.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.323
- What?
- Annie's pregnant too.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.659
- Oh, no!
- I didn't hear that!

42:17.701 --> 42:21.913
Mother and daughter are
pregnant together? Oh!

42:22.038 --> 42:24.582
That is fabulous!
I love that ! That's chic.

42:24.624 --> 42:28.795
- I think I'm gonna faint.
- He did.

42:28.878 --> 42:31.797
This is what I suggest. You must
let me do the baby shower.

42:31.964 --> 42:34.884
- Howard, hands me the book.
Quick. Quick, boy.
- Oh!

42:35.050 --> 42:38.846
No, no, Franck. Not this time.
No more parties. No way. N-O.

42:38.887 --> 42:42.015
You never wants to have fun,
George. And you never change.

42:42.057 --> 42:44.893
Every party has a pooper
That's why we invited you

42:44.976 --> 42:47.979
- Party pooper
- Party pooper

42:48.104 --> 42:52.066
Every party has a pooper
That's why we invited you George Banks

42:52.149 --> 42:54.485
- That's you
- It was on the second chorus...

42:54.610 --> 42:57.738
of ''Every party has a pooper''
that I got woozy again.

42:57.821 --> 43:01.825
Next thing I knew, we
were driving through town.

43:01.992 --> 43:04.536
Nina was glowing.

43:04.661 --> 43:07.622
She looked so peaceful.

43:07.705 --> 43:11.959
Grab your coat
and get your hat

43:12.001 --> 43:16.338
Leave your worries
on the doorstep

43:16.422 --> 43:19.841
- You can't get me!
- Just direct your feet
- Slow down, son!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, son!

43:19.967 --> 43:25.138
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- To the sunny side of the street

43:25.221 --> 43:29.267
Can you hear
the pitter-pat

43:29.434 --> 43:33.562
- Yeah, that happy tune he's whistlin'
- George?

43:33.646 --> 43:37.691
- Nina?
- Honey, I need to know how
you feel about all this.
- Life can be so sweet

43:37.816 --> 43:40.944
- Dad, I want a hot dog!
- On the sunny side of the street

43:40.986 --> 43:44.072
- They don't have any hot dogs!
They don't have hot dogs!
- I don't like--

43:44.155 --> 43:48.660
Don't! Josh! No! No! No!

43:48.785 --> 43:51.913
I feel super about it.
I'm totally up for it.

43:52.079 --> 43:55.666
- You are?
- Definitely.

43:55.791 --> 43:57.709
Oh!

44:08.428 --> 44:10.555
So what do you think? You think we have
the stamina to have a baby?

44:10.680 --> 44:12.431
What do you mean, honey?
For the actual pregnancy?

44:12.515 --> 44:15.392
- Well, I know I have
the stamina for that part.
- Oh, well. That's a relief.

44:15.434 --> 44:18.270
I'm talking about the rest of it,
like the next 18 years part.

44:18.395 --> 44:20.647
But, George, for weeks you've been
telling me how young you are.

44:20.814 --> 44:23.567
- And you've been telling me
how old we are.
- Well, we're obviously
not too old, honey.

44:23.608 --> 44:27.487
Well, Nina, let's be honest. I
mean, just because a man wears sneakers,
it doesn't make him a teenager.

44:27.612 --> 44:31.532
I was completely kidding myself.
When I was working out at the gym, there
were 60 year olds more buff than me.

44:31.616 --> 44:33.492
Oh, so we're too old for this. ls that
what you're trying to tell me, George?

44:33.617 --> 44:35.494
No, it's just that I was beginning
to feel like we were approaching...

44:35.661 --> 44:37.496
that big parenting
finishing line.

44:37.621 --> 44:39.706
Now to be all the way back
at the starting gate?

44:39.790 --> 44:43.251
Not to mention, we will be
like the oldest parents ever
at the starting gate.

44:43.293 --> 44:46.629
I mean, let's face it. Between us,
we're almost a hundred years old.

44:46.796 --> 44:48.673
But don't get me wrong.
I'm into it.

44:48.798 --> 44:53.094
3:00 a.m. feedings and diapers and car
seats and Mister Rogers and vomiting.

44:55.429 --> 44:57.347
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:57.514 --> 45:01.059
Hi, sweetie. Hi.

45:01.143 --> 45:02.727
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

45:02.769 --> 45:04.437
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Everything go okay?

45:04.521 --> 45:08.066
Oh. Oh.

45:08.191 --> 45:09.776
So what's going on?
What'd the doctor say?

45:09.901 --> 45:12.236
Is that, uh, TV still on the blink?
Because I have time now, I--

45:12.320 --> 45:14.530
- Dad.
- Okay.

45:14.697 --> 45:18.742
- Well, he, uh--
- Mom, you can tell me. I'm a big girl.

45:18.826 --> 45:22.704
Well, honey, as it turns out,
my, my blood tests are fine.

45:22.913 --> 45:25.874
- Good.
- Yeah. And I'm not even
going through menopause.

45:25.957 --> 45:28.793
- I thought you were too young for that.
- Yeah, well, I don't know.

45:28.876 --> 45:30.878
So what is it?
Did he find anything?

45:30.920 --> 45:35.466
Well, actually, he did, didn't he?
He did find a little something.

45:35.674 --> 45:37.760
He did? What?

45:37.843 --> 45:41.972
Believe it or not,
your father and I--

45:42.013 --> 45:45.517
- We're going to have a baby.
- We're pregnant!

45:46.893 --> 45:50.396
You guys!
That is so unfunny.

45:50.563 --> 45:53.524
I mean, can you imagine
if that were true?

45:53.566 --> 45:55.943
I mean, you couldn't be.

46:00.906 --> 46:02.949
You're serious?
You're really pregnant?

46:03.074 --> 46:05.452
I'm due September 4,
Labor Day.

46:05.535 --> 46:08.663
Perfect timing, huh? Labor Day.
You know, we should go now.

46:08.705 --> 46:11.624
- Mom, you're pregnant?
- Well, honey.

46:11.749 --> 46:14.418
It's not something we planned. Sometimes
these things, they just happen.

46:14.543 --> 46:18.088
Who knew? You know,
it was a rainy afternoon.

46:18.172 --> 46:22.300
And, uh, your mom and I were
all alone in the house.

46:22.384 --> 46:27.639
Then, uh, one thing leads to another.
And then the next thing you know, hey.

46:27.764 --> 46:32.685
- Daddy!
- At that moment, I wanted to
crawl under the sofa and die.

46:32.810 --> 46:34.728
You old son of a gun.

46:34.895 --> 46:37.564
''Son of a gun''?
I wish I had a gun.

46:37.731 --> 46:40.692
If it wasn't for this kid
coming into our lives, none of
this would ever have happened.

46:40.734 --> 46:42.777
- It's okay.
- Gee, I don't know what to say.

46:42.903 --> 46:45.947
- That's okay.
- I just never thought we'd both
be pregnant at the same time.

46:46.072 --> 46:49.242
- Yeah, well.
- I'm not crying because I'm
sad, really, because I'm not.

46:49.367 --> 46:51.244
- No. What's-- Well--
- I gotta get a Kleenex.

46:51.410 --> 46:54.872
Annie? Oh.
Annie, don't-- Don't cry, honey.

46:54.997 --> 46:57.082
She's been kind of
emotional lately.

46:57.166 --> 47:01.920
So, our kids will be what?
Not brother and sister. That's wrong.

47:02.003 --> 47:06.091
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Their kid will be your brother
or sister and our kid's cousin?

47:06.132 --> 47:08.051
No, your kid's
uncle or aunt.

47:08.176 --> 47:11.179
Yeah, but our kid will probably
be more comfortable calling us
Grandma and Grandpa...

47:11.262 --> 47:13.514
just like your kid, you know, at
least in front of his friends.

47:13.597 --> 47:17.518
You know, 'cause let's face it.
We're gonna be in our fifties
when he's in preschool.

47:17.601 --> 47:20.395
In our sixties,
when he graduates college.

47:20.562 --> 47:23.398
But, you know, that'll be great
to see another kid in cap and gown,

47:23.523 --> 47:26.025
you know, if we can
still see by then.

47:26.109 --> 47:28.820
Now, at least going to the movies,
that'll be economical.

47:28.986 --> 47:31.822
''One child, two seniors.
Thanks.''

47:31.948 --> 47:35.326
Kid's gonna love spending
his adolescence in a retirement home.

47:35.492 --> 47:37.870
At least he won't have to worry
about us hearing him come in late.

47:38.036 --> 47:41.248
That's right, honey, because
we won't be able to hear, right?

47:41.373 --> 47:43.625
Exactly.

47:43.667 --> 47:46.711
You're so hilarious, George. You're so
hilarious. You're so sensitive.

47:46.794 --> 47:51.424
And I really appreciate you
asking me how I feel about
all this, especially since...

47:51.465 --> 47:53.843
I'm the one who's going
to be having the baby.

47:56.387 --> 47:58.263
You're right.

47:59.181 --> 48:01.058
How do you feel about it?

48:01.141 --> 48:06.312
I know how old I am, George. I've
already been the mother of the bride.

48:06.354 --> 48:10.316
But here I am at the age I am,
and I'm pregnant.

48:10.358 --> 48:14.945
And, you know, I don't
think that qualifies me for
the Guinness Book Of Records, George.

48:15.112 --> 48:20.158
So in answer to your question,
I'm very happy!

48:20.200 --> 48:22.619
I'm happy and
I'm feeling nervous...

48:22.744 --> 48:27.582
and I'm just
very much alone.

48:27.665 --> 48:30.460
Well, anyway,
good-bye, sweetie.

48:30.543 --> 48:34.255
I've gotta go. Yeah.
And thank you so much, Bryan.

48:34.338 --> 48:36.298
Thank you. Thank you.

48:43.263 --> 48:47.892
Do me a favor.
Don't follow me, Banks! No!

48:56.150 --> 48:57.943
I went after her,
but it didn't do much good.

48:58.986 --> 49:02.197
I called her, but she refused
to pick up the phone.

49:02.364 --> 49:04.866
Calling me ''Banks''
was never a good sign.

49:07.076 --> 49:10.705
Fortunately, my daughter was kind enough
to put her old man up for the night.

49:23.341 --> 49:26.261
But I couldn't sleep.

49:26.302 --> 49:29.222
I was worried I wouldn't
have what it takes,

49:29.222 --> 49:31.474
that I wouldn't be the same
for the next one.

49:45.028 --> 49:47.864
- Okay? I miss you.
- Yes.
- Okay.

49:47.989 --> 49:52.576
Okay, gimme a kiss.
Gimme a kiss. I love you.

49:55.537 --> 49:57.790
Bye, Daddy. I love you.

49:57.956 --> 49:59.833
Go up and see Mommy.

50:05.588 --> 50:07.632
I love you, Daddy.

50:20.268 --> 50:24.356
Sorry, Maple Drive's closed.
You'll have to use the detour.

50:37.910 --> 50:42.289
- My house!
- Bye-bye, house.

50:43.456 --> 50:45.041
Bring it back!

50:48.586 --> 50:51.714
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop!

50:51.839 --> 50:55.009
Stop! Stop that ball!
Stop it! Stop that!

50:55.092 --> 50:59.054
Hey, stop! Stop. Stop!

50:59.179 --> 51:01.765
- Stop! Stop, stop!
- Stop!

51:01.890 --> 51:06.519
- Stop! Stop! Stop.
- Hold, please!

51:09.772 --> 51:12.024
- Hang on, guys!
- You have a problem, George?

51:12.066 --> 51:15.694
Mr. Habib, you didn't tell me
you were gonna tear down the house.

51:15.819 --> 51:20.198
- You didn't ask.
- I didn't ask because it just
never entered my mind.

51:20.365 --> 51:22.868
But since you obviously don't want
the house, I have the perfect solution.

51:23.034 --> 51:25.870
Sell the house back to me! I still have
your check here in my wallet.

51:25.995 --> 51:28.373
- I never even cashed it.
- I don't think so, George.

51:28.539 --> 51:33.669
See, I demolish house, build two in
its place. This a great piece of land.

51:33.794 --> 51:38.132
Mr. Habib, this is not
''a piece of land.''

51:38.257 --> 51:42.385
This is my home,
and I'm gonna be a father again...

51:42.427 --> 51:47.015
and I don't want to bring
my baby home from the hospital
to a condo on the beach.

51:47.140 --> 51:50.059
I wanna drive
down that street,

51:51.269 --> 51:54.438
and I wanna pull
into this driveway,

51:54.563 --> 51:57.107
and I wanna honk my horn--

51:57.274 --> 51:59.610
Yes, yes, okay. I know.

52:02.028 --> 52:04.281
Mr. Habib, please.

52:04.447 --> 52:06.950
You see this pathway?

52:06.991 --> 52:12.121
I laid these bricks
with my own two hands.

52:12.246 --> 52:15.583
I planted this grass.

52:15.666 --> 52:18.710
I-- I built this fence.

52:20.587 --> 52:24.424
I broke that window
with a frisbee!

52:28.553 --> 52:30.471
I painted these shutters.

52:31.722 --> 52:34.934
Don't bulldoze
my memories, man.

52:35.017 --> 52:38.687
I'm begging you.
Sell me back my home.

52:43.441 --> 52:47.028
Boy. For how much?

52:47.111 --> 52:49.238
You wanna make a profit
on something you owned for one day?

52:49.322 --> 52:51.240
Yes!

52:52.575 --> 52:54.827
Fine.

52:54.869 --> 52:57.621
Will $5,000
do the trick?

53:01.291 --> 53:04.002
George, just another day ago,

53:04.044 --> 53:07.630
I turned down profit
of 50,000 on lot.

53:07.672 --> 53:12.468
Now, you want to double that,
I consider selling back.

53:12.593 --> 53:16.638
You want me to take out
a loan on something I owned free
and clear just 24 hours ago?

53:16.805 --> 53:18.724
Well, that is up to you, George.

53:18.891 --> 53:23.186
Your path, your fence,
your memories.

53:23.311 --> 53:27.649
You don't know what you're asking, sir.
I am the cheapest man alive.

53:27.774 --> 53:31.194
Then move aside, George,
'cause I going to level the place.

53:31.360 --> 53:34.488
We go to work!
Come, come! Go, go!

53:38.117 --> 53:41.578
- Commence to start!
- Commence to start!

54:06.142 --> 54:10.104
- All right!
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

54:11.564 --> 54:17.277
You win.
One hundred thousand dollars.

54:17.444 --> 54:22.115
Very close shave, George. Yes, make out,
please, to the Habib Group.

54:22.282 --> 54:24.576
- Habib Group.
- Inc.

54:24.617 --> 54:27.328
- Inc.
- Very good.

54:27.412 --> 54:30.081
- Welcome home, George.
- It feels good to be back.

54:30.248 --> 54:32.124
Well, I happy I could help.

54:32.208 --> 54:34.627
Mr. Habib,
just one last question.

54:34.793 --> 54:38.297
Would you mind getting
your wrecking ball off my lawn?

54:38.464 --> 54:42.425
Oh, sure. Anything you say, George.
You're the boss.

54:43.927 --> 54:47.597
- We go. Move out!
- That's right! I'm the boss!

54:47.722 --> 54:49.766
So all you guys,
get a move on!

54:49.807 --> 54:51.434
- Get that dump truck out of here!
- Right away!

54:51.517 --> 54:53.519
- And quit standing on my shutters!
- Sorry.

54:53.602 --> 54:56.855
And all of you guys, just pack up
your stuff and hit the road!

54:56.939 --> 55:00.150
And don't trample the pansies.

55:01.485 --> 55:03.695
I laid those bricks,
I planted those pansies,

55:03.820 --> 55:06.239
I painted those shutters,
I broke that window!

55:11.410 --> 55:13.287
I'm home.

55:17.458 --> 55:19.334
I'm home!

55:29.469 --> 55:32.138
First thing I did
was apologize to Nina.

55:32.221 --> 55:34.890
That is not funny, George.
I'm not gonna listen to you.

55:34.974 --> 55:39.811
Then I told her I bought
the new baby a present.

55:39.937 --> 55:44.607
- That did it. Twenty-four hours
later, we moved back home.
- George!

55:45.984 --> 55:49.487
Before we knew it,
it was spring.

55:49.612 --> 55:51.906
- Here you go.
- Everything was in full bloom,

55:52.031 --> 55:54.950
including the women
in my life.

55:55.034 --> 55:58.120
Hello? Oh, hi, honey.

55:58.203 --> 56:01.581
- Baby's been kicking a lot.
- Annie and Nina were
in their second trimesters.

56:01.665 --> 56:04.000
- There was no denying it now.
- Yeah, I know we can't sing.

56:04.125 --> 56:08.421
The stork was not only on his way,
he was circling the neighborhood.

56:11.215 --> 56:13.467
Still trying
to redeem myself,

56:13.551 --> 56:15.970
I did the unthinkable.

56:16.011 --> 56:19.765
I hired Franck to surprise the girls
with a double baby shower.

56:21.349 --> 56:24.853
- It's a baby shower! Oh!
- Hello, ladies.

56:24.978 --> 56:29.148
What dreams are made of!
Look what I have for you!

56:29.273 --> 56:31.609
- It was picture perfect,
- Oh, my!

56:31.692 --> 56:35.738
topped off by two surprise
guests flown in for the occasion
all the way from Vienna.

56:39.783 --> 56:43.995
- It's a stork!
- Oh, my God.

56:44.079 --> 56:45.830
- After the shower,
- Thank you.

56:45.955 --> 56:47.665
Nina was showing a few of her friends
the new baby's room...

56:47.790 --> 56:50.168
and Franck started giving
decorating tips.

56:50.251 --> 56:52.336
But this is what I suggest.

56:52.461 --> 56:54.380
Firstly, if it were me,
you know,

56:54.421 --> 56:59.009
what I would do is I'd
push those windows out and let
sweet San Marino light fill in.

57:01.803 --> 57:04.139
Therefore, the third trimester
in the Banks family began...

57:04.222 --> 57:08.226
with a remodel of what we
now affectionately called
''the baby's suite.''

57:11.020 --> 57:14.398
I'll admit we got a little carried away,
and it wasn't even all Franck's fault,

57:14.523 --> 57:17.067
although God knows
I tried to blame him.

57:17.192 --> 57:18.777
- Hey! Hey!
- No, no, no, no!

57:18.902 --> 57:21.029
Nina and Annie were doing great,
right on schedule...

57:21.196 --> 57:25.450
and weighing in at 128
and 132 pounds respectively.

57:25.617 --> 57:27.368
Ohh! Oh.

57:28.911 --> 57:31.080
We had everything you'd expect
when you're expecting:

57:31.122 --> 57:33.833
leg cramps, backaches
and cravings.

57:33.874 --> 57:36.251
And the women were worse.

57:42.382 --> 57:44.301
What we didn't expect
one sleepy night...

57:44.426 --> 57:47.011
was an unexpected visitor.

57:52.933 --> 57:55.603
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- You okay?

57:57.104 --> 57:59.356
I'm fine.

57:59.481 --> 58:01.608
Bryan and I got in a fight.

58:01.691 --> 58:06.321
And I got angry and got in my car.
I didn't know where to go.

58:06.488 --> 58:09.323
- Did I wake Mom?
- No, no, no. She's asleep.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.877
So, do you wanna, you know--

58:22.043 --> 58:24.587
Yeah, sure, I can talk about it.
It's not, you know-- It's fine.

58:24.629 --> 58:28.216
- 'Ca-- If you don't wanna, it's okay,
'cause I could just make up the sofa.
- No, no, that's-- it's okay.

58:28.341 --> 58:30.218
Thanks.

58:33.429 --> 58:35.764
- Pretzel?
- No, thanks.

58:41.853 --> 58:44.272
All right.
Here's what happened.

58:44.439 --> 58:48.276
When I was leaving work today,
my boss calls me in, tells me
what a great job I'm doing...

58:48.401 --> 58:52.655
and says I have as much promise
as anyone she's hired
since she's been at the firm.

58:52.822 --> 58:55.824
Then she said the great part. She said
that she's been asked to select...

58:55.950 --> 58:58.410
one person from my level
to be part of a design team...

58:58.494 --> 59:02.247
that's gonna design the new
Boston Museum of Contemporary
Art, and she picked me.

59:02.330 --> 59:05.291
- That's fantastic.
- I know. I was completely thrilled.

59:05.417 --> 59:08.002
Plus, to live in Boston.
I love Boston.

59:08.127 --> 59:11.130
- You have to, uh--
- Move to Boston. Yeah.

59:11.214 --> 59:14.175
I need to be there right after
the baby's born, by October.

59:14.341 --> 59:16.677
- Uh-huh.
- I knew when they hired me...

59:16.802 --> 59:19.304
that this was a possibility
one day, and Bryan knew it too.

59:19.429 --> 59:24.601
But now, well-- I rush home
to tell him the news, and as soon as
I say the word ''Boston,'' his face drops.

59:24.642 --> 59:29.188
I mean, this is the kind of opportunity
everybody dreams about, and we're
talking Massachusetts here, not Mars.

59:31.607 --> 59:35.402
So Bryan doesn't wanna go?

59:35.527 --> 59:39.323
Well, he said that he understood
that career-wise it was great for me,

59:39.448 --> 59:43.076
but with the baby coming,
he figured I wouldn't wanna go.

59:43.243 --> 59:45.995
- Which is--
- Ridiculous.
- Right.

59:46.037 --> 59:50.041
It's like under that mellow,
'90s Gap ad exterior of his...

59:50.166 --> 59:55.045
beats the heart of a 1950s
husband that just expects me to
take a backseat to his career.

59:55.087 --> 59:58.799
- You said that to him?
- Of course.

59:58.924 --> 1:00:03.386
To which he said I was nuts,
and that all he meant was that
with us having a new baby,

1:00:03.470 --> 1:00:07.557
it just seemed like a crazy time
to move to sub-zero weather
and a city full of strangers,

1:00:07.682 --> 1:00:09.725
and that I should think
of you guys...

1:00:09.892 --> 1:00:14.939
and of his parents, and how moving so
far away would be so hard on everyone.

1:00:15.022 --> 1:00:19.526
Anyway, I knew if anybody would
understand how I felt, it would be you.

1:00:19.651 --> 1:00:24.197
You were the one that always told me
to go for my dreams, never to settle.

1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:26.908
Dad, tell me.
Am I being unreasonable to want to go?

1:00:26.950 --> 1:00:30.703
Because if you think I am,
I won't go. I won't.

1:00:37.251 --> 1:00:40.545
Ann, you have to go.
This is not the Dark Ages.

1:00:40.712 --> 1:00:43.923
We'll still see each other all the time.
You'll just be an airplane ride away.

1:00:44.090 --> 1:00:45.925
That's exactly
what I said.

1:00:46.009 --> 1:00:48.136
And wasn't Bryan the one
who said you were a gifted architect...

1:00:48.261 --> 1:00:50.138
- and he'd move anywhere you got a job?
- Yes.

1:00:50.263 --> 1:00:52.723
And wouldn't you move for him if he
was the one being offered the promotion?

1:00:52.890 --> 1:00:54.350
In a minute.

1:00:56.268 --> 1:00:58.687
Oh, gosh, that must be him.

1:01:10.406 --> 1:01:12.283
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:17.079
Hi, Dad.

1:01:19.206 --> 1:01:24.127
Um, Annie, I-I realize
that-- that--

1:01:24.252 --> 1:01:26.129
Did you tell your dad?

1:01:27.797 --> 1:01:30.007
Sorry, George.
I didn't mean to be so lame.

1:01:30.174 --> 1:01:32.802
Hey, you guys go ahead.
It's not up to me.

1:01:32.968 --> 1:01:36.805
Okay. Annie, I realized
after you left that, uh,

1:01:36.847 --> 1:01:40.434
if the same thing happened to me,
you'd come with me anytime, anywhere.

1:01:40.517 --> 1:01:43.770
- I would.
- So I wanna do the same for you.

1:01:45.647 --> 1:01:49.233
- God, honey, I am so sorry l--
- Oh.

1:01:51.652 --> 1:01:53.821
I just don't want you
to ever resent me for this.

1:01:53.946 --> 1:01:57.866
Hey, I can work out of Boston
just as easy as I can work out of L.A.

1:01:57.991 --> 1:02:00.952
And I don't want you
to ever resent me, ever.

1:02:07.834 --> 1:02:11.629
- Okay. So then we're goin'.
- Okay.

1:02:13.756 --> 1:02:16.592
The baby has hiccups.

1:02:16.675 --> 1:02:18.427
- Oh, yeah.
- Did you feel that?
- Yes.

1:02:18.510 --> 1:02:20.429
Boston.

1:02:30.730 --> 1:02:35.276
As I watched the kids pull
out of the driveway, I got an
all-too-familiar pain in my gut.

1:02:35.359 --> 1:02:39.321
The one I always got when I did
something for one of the kids
that fell under the heading of,

1:02:39.446 --> 1:02:41.865
''I did it for their own good.''

1:02:43.533 --> 1:02:46.202
And then I thought
about baby number three...

1:02:46.244 --> 1:02:49.622
and 25 more years
of moments like this.

1:02:49.747 --> 1:02:52.833
And suddenly,
I was tired.

1:03:11.058 --> 1:03:14.895
I'll be able to do it again.
I'm sure I can.

1:03:21.193 --> 1:03:25.030
All right. lf it swishes,
no problem.

1:03:25.071 --> 1:03:27.490
Father of the Year.

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:34.288
Not swishes!
Just goes in! Well.

1:03:42.837 --> 1:03:46.716
- Oh, it's frying!
- Well, we made it to July.

1:03:46.799 --> 1:03:51.637
The Farmer's Almanac said
it was the hottest month L.A.
had seen in over half a century.

1:03:51.762 --> 1:03:54.557
- Did you see it?
- Nina was four weeks from her due date,

1:03:54.723 --> 1:03:57.726
- and Annie was two days past hers.
- Howard! Howard!

1:03:57.810 --> 1:04:01.730
Franck and his crew were working
around the clock to have
the baby's room ready by D day.

1:04:01.813 --> 1:04:03.815
Life was hectic,

1:04:03.940 --> 1:04:06.109
- especially once Annie moved in.
- I better go.

1:04:06.317 --> 1:04:09.695
Bryan was called to an emergency
meeting in Japan, and since
Annie's doctor assured us...

1:04:09.779 --> 1:04:12.073
that the baby was at least
another week away,

1:04:12.198 --> 1:04:15.743
-Bryan took the red-eye to Tokyo
and left Annie in our care.
-Bye.

1:04:15.826 --> 1:04:19.663
So there I was, living with
two extremely pregnant women...

1:04:19.788 --> 1:04:23.083
- during the worst heat wave
of the century.
- Okay. Okay.

1:04:23.250 --> 1:04:26.377
Annie and Nina dealt with
the heat by adding extra
air conditioners to the house,

1:04:26.461 --> 1:04:29.213
turning our home into
the only igloo in San Marino.

1:04:29.338 --> 1:04:31.340
- How we doing, girls?
- Good.
- Dad, would you mind...

1:04:31.465 --> 1:04:33.717
- adjusting the pillow behind my back?
- Sure, sure.

1:04:33.801 --> 1:04:36.011
- Yeah. George. George.
- Oh, thank you.

1:04:36.136 --> 1:04:38.096
Prop that pillow up
under my foot, would you please?

1:04:38.138 --> 1:04:40.057
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Thank you, honey.
- Lemonade?

1:04:40.182 --> 1:04:42.934
Thank you, yes.
Oh, and George,

1:04:43.018 --> 1:04:45.270
- would you please scratch
my left ankle?
- Mm-hmm.

1:04:45.437 --> 1:04:47.647
My mission was to keep them
calm and comfortable.

1:04:47.772 --> 1:04:50.650
I tied their shoes, massaged their
backs, painted their toenails...

1:04:50.775 --> 1:04:53.819
and went to every imaginable
take-out restaurant in the city.

1:04:53.944 --> 1:04:57.197
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Gotta go get dinner.

1:04:57.322 --> 1:05:00.117
- Matty, hold down
the fort while I'm gone.
- Okay, Dad.

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:05.371
George! Turn the air conditioning up
on your way out. It's stifling in here.

1:05:05.455 --> 1:05:07.373
Oh, boy.

1:05:11.002 --> 1:05:14.046
Uh, now, you all have
my beeper number just in case.

1:05:16.173 --> 1:05:19.343
- Shut the door!
- Shut the door!

1:05:19.468 --> 1:05:23.388
Here we go. Here we go.
Dinnertime. Dinnertime. All right.

1:05:23.513 --> 1:05:25.974
- Thai noodles with chicken,
white meat only.
- That's me.

1:05:26.057 --> 1:05:28.059
- Oh, yeah, Annie.
- And let's see.

1:05:28.184 --> 1:05:31.145
- Uh, Taco Grande.
- Mm, honey. Yes.
- Extra rice, no beans.

1:05:31.229 --> 1:05:35.691
- Ooh. Mmm. Thank you, honey.
- All right. Uh, lox, bagels
and cream cheese.

1:05:35.816 --> 1:05:37.943
Thanks, Dad.

1:05:38.068 --> 1:05:42.113
All right now.
Where's Dad's? Where's Dad's?

1:05:42.239 --> 1:05:45.617
As the days rolled by
and nothing happened,

1:05:45.742 --> 1:05:47.702
the tension mounted.

1:05:47.827 --> 1:05:50.121
I found myself watching Annie
as if she were a time bomb.

1:05:51.664 --> 1:05:53.290
- Ouch!
- What?
- What?

1:05:53.374 --> 1:05:56.502
Ouch. O-U-C-H.

1:05:56.585 --> 1:05:58.921
- Oh!
- Hey, good word.
- Honey.

1:05:59.046 --> 1:06:01.590
- Ohh.
- That's 20 points.

1:06:01.715 --> 1:06:04.509
Every night we laid out our clothes
so we could grab them in a hurry.

1:06:04.634 --> 1:06:07.845
We were like firefighters ready
to jump at the first alarm.

1:06:11.140 --> 1:06:13.225
Okay. Okay.

1:06:16.186 --> 1:06:18.897
I'm hot!

1:06:19.022 --> 1:06:20.857
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:06:35.663 --> 1:06:37.790
It's about that time.

1:06:37.915 --> 1:06:41.209
- George!
- All right, everybody stay calm!
- Okay. Okay.

1:06:41.334 --> 1:06:44.713
Now, I've mapped out the
various routes to the hospital.
We can, uh-- Oh, it's just, uh--

1:06:44.838 --> 1:06:48.716
What, uh, what time is it?
It's, uh-- All right, it's 11:36. 11:36.

1:06:48.758 --> 1:06:52.053
All right.
So that would be 11:36.

1:06:52.178 --> 1:06:54.471
Plan ''F,'' uh, route ''B.''

1:06:54.597 --> 1:06:58.976
We can be there in 17 minutes.
Annie, don't worry.
We got everything under control.

1:07:00.811 --> 1:07:03.688
What is this?
What am I wearing?

1:07:03.855 --> 1:07:06.232
My blouse.

1:07:14.657 --> 1:07:16.575
- Oh, honey!
- What? What happened?
- Oh, my God.

1:07:16.658 --> 1:07:20.078
- Sorry. False alarm.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Well, that doesn't--
- It's all right.

1:07:20.203 --> 1:07:21.913
- Don't worry about it.
- That's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- That's not unusual.

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:23.915
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry about it.
- That can happen.

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.292
We'll be back
before you know it.

1:07:26.292 --> 1:07:28.711
We got home just
as the sun came up.

1:07:28.795 --> 1:07:32.048
The girls fell right
to sleep...

1:07:32.173 --> 1:07:34.842
as I headed off to work.

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:39.346
Hello! It's fabric day.

1:07:39.471 --> 1:07:42.390
- Hello, George.
- Hi.
- A pleasure to see you.

1:07:42.432 --> 1:07:45.977
And oddly enough, knowing Franck was
at the house made me feel better,

1:07:46.102 --> 1:07:49.188
although I have no idea
what he did there all day.

1:07:49.313 --> 1:07:52.858
Do the baby workout
Make the babies gleeful

1:07:54.610 --> 1:07:56.528
Oh, that's good.
That's good!

1:07:56.612 --> 1:08:00.032
Little tin soldier
Happy tin soldier

1:08:00.198 --> 1:08:02.993
Right. And now
with an attitude.

1:08:03.118 --> 1:08:06.496
Hello! Who you?

1:08:06.621 --> 1:08:11.626
Get away! I don't
like what you say! Now, leg up--

1:08:37.941 --> 1:08:39.901
Uh-oh. Mom! Dad!

1:08:40.027 --> 1:08:43.655
- I'll get it. What flavor?
- No flavor. This is it.

1:08:43.738 --> 1:08:46.366
Good. I didn't even
get undressed this time.

1:08:46.491 --> 1:08:48.785
Where's my chart?

1:08:53.414 --> 1:08:56.125
- George, don't forget the suitcase!
- I won't!

1:08:59.211 --> 1:09:01.088
Dad, keys!

1:09:11.389 --> 1:09:14.683
You'd think I could tell the difference
between labor pains and indigestion.

1:09:14.767 --> 1:09:17.978
- Yeah.
- I'm really sorry, Mom. Really.

1:09:19.229 --> 1:09:21.106
- Mom?
- I understand, honey.

1:09:21.231 --> 1:09:24.109
You know, I think-- Oh, boy,
I think I just gotta--

1:09:24.234 --> 1:09:27.362
- I'm gonna lie down here
just for a sec.
- Oh, me too.

1:09:29.155 --> 1:09:31.907
I'm gonna go catch
a few winks before I--

1:09:38.830 --> 1:09:41.083
Dad, where've you been?
I'm late for camp!

1:09:41.249 --> 1:09:43.543
- Camp. Camp.
- Come on!

1:09:43.585 --> 1:09:46.880
At this point I hadn't
slept in 48 hours.

1:09:47.005 --> 1:09:49.549
Have a good day
at work, George.

1:09:49.674 --> 1:09:51.676
Yeah, Dad. Good night.

1:10:11.777 --> 1:10:13.654
Ohh.

1:10:26.457 --> 1:10:30.545
Hello! Pappala's home!
We got a surprise for you, George.

1:10:30.628 --> 1:10:32.922
I'm sorry I can't stay,
George,

1:10:33.047 --> 1:10:37.926
but I-- Whoops! I caught a cold
from your house.

1:10:38.010 --> 1:10:40.345
Come on, George.
Hurry up. ''Quick-ah.''

1:10:40.512 --> 1:10:42.722
I'm too tired
to ''kovick-ah.''

1:10:42.806 --> 1:10:45.767
Okay, George, this is it.
The baby suite is finished.

1:10:45.850 --> 1:10:48.019
Think of it, buddy.
After today, I'm out of your hair.

1:10:48.144 --> 1:10:50.813
- Did we come in on budget?
- Close enough, George. Close enough.

1:10:50.855 --> 1:10:53.983
- Now close those eyes.
- Oh, Franck, I'm not
gonna close my eyes.
- Don't ''oh, Franck'' me.

1:10:54.024 --> 1:10:56.735
You never wants to have any fun.
Close those eyes.

1:10:56.819 --> 1:10:59.238
- All right.
- Drumroll, if you please.

1:11:02.991 --> 1:11:04.909
Okay, open up.

1:11:21.341 --> 1:11:23.760
Welcome to babyland.

1:11:25.762 --> 1:11:28.056
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you, sir.

1:11:28.139 --> 1:11:30.850
I mean it.
It's perfect.

1:11:31.017 --> 1:11:35.312
Oh, well, coming from you, George Banks,
that-- that means a lot.

1:11:36.397 --> 1:11:38.315
A lot.

1:11:39.941 --> 1:11:41.860
A whole lot.

1:11:44.529 --> 1:11:47.699
And here's the bill.
Ju-Just don't go nuts, George.

1:11:47.824 --> 1:11:51.994
Just-Just-Just try to remember, uh, what
you feel right at this minute, okay?

1:11:52.036 --> 1:11:54.747
In fact, do me a favor.
Maybe you open it after I leave.

1:11:54.872 --> 1:11:56.749
That will be better.

1:12:05.965 --> 1:12:09.635
- George!
- He's up here and he loves it!

1:12:09.677 --> 1:12:12.805
Oh, well, good!
Honey, dinner's ready.

1:12:12.888 --> 1:12:15.891
- She cooked?
- She wants to give you a break.

1:12:16.016 --> 1:12:20.395
She's been cooking up a storm all day
in that freezing kitchen.

1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:22.480
What's the matter, George?
You look a little pooped.

1:12:22.564 --> 1:12:24.983
Oh, I haven't slept in three days.
You know, I try to sleep at work,

1:12:25.066 --> 1:12:28.361
but I keep thinking any minute
one of 'em's gonna go into labor
and I'll just end up--

1:12:28.486 --> 1:12:31.447
Totally wired. Trust me.
I know the feeling.

1:12:31.572 --> 1:12:35.492
And do you know how
I spell relief? V-A-T-S-N-I-K.

1:12:35.576 --> 1:12:38.495
- V-A-T-S-N-I-K?
- Vatsnik.

1:12:38.579 --> 1:12:41.665
The best sleeping pill in
the whole wide world. I swear by them.

1:12:41.790 --> 1:12:44.667
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't take sleeping pills.

1:12:44.751 --> 1:12:47.420
Oh, George, you need
your rest. You do.

1:12:47.587 --> 1:12:50.047
What if they need you,
and you're walking into walls?

1:12:50.214 --> 1:12:54.051
Believe me, I never take pills myself
neither. But sometimes, I need to rest.

1:12:54.176 --> 1:12:57.554
So I take a half a Vatsnik,
close my eyes, and I wake up a new man,

1:12:57.679 --> 1:13:00.891
refreshed and replenished
and ''roaring'' to go.

1:13:00.974 --> 1:13:03.435
Just-- You know what?
Keep them. They're very mild.

1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:06.229
- Mild?
- Oh, yeah. No, y-y-you'll
thank me. You'll see.

1:13:06.354 --> 1:13:10.358
- George, Franck, dinner!
- On our way. ''Quick-ah.''

1:13:12.610 --> 1:13:15.613
I'm so happy that you
like the room, George.

1:13:15.779 --> 1:13:18.532
Sit next to me
at dinner, okay?

1:13:36.548 --> 1:13:38.592
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Matty. How was camp?

1:13:38.675 --> 1:13:40.927
- Good.
- Ann, how're you feelin'?

1:13:41.053 --> 1:13:43.555
Great. Really energized.
Bryan's coming home tomorrow.

1:13:43.638 --> 1:13:47.267
- Don't think we'll see
any action tonight?
- Don't think so, Dad.

1:13:47.392 --> 1:13:49.560
- Hey, honey. How're you feelin'?
- Oh, good. Fine.

1:13:49.644 --> 1:13:53.105
- Went to the doctor today.
- And?
- And right on schedule.

1:13:53.230 --> 1:13:54.899
Three weeks.

1:13:54.940 --> 1:13:57.359
Hmm. Well, here goes.

1:14:01.696 --> 1:14:05.116
- Dad, what are you taking?
- Well, Dad hasn't been
sleeping so well lately,

1:14:05.241 --> 1:14:08.119
so I thought I'd take
a couple of very mild sleeping pills.

1:14:09.454 --> 1:14:10.872
Hmm.

1:14:11.998 --> 1:14:14.166
Please pass the rolls.

1:14:15.292 --> 1:14:17.711
Thanks.

1:14:17.836 --> 1:14:20.130
Dad?

1:14:20.255 --> 1:14:22.716
- What's he doing? What's going on?
- George? George?

1:14:22.883 --> 1:14:25.718
I never saw anything like it.
He said, ''Pass the rolls.''

1:14:25.844 --> 1:14:29.138
- By the time I passed them,
he was gone.
- George!

1:14:29.222 --> 1:14:31.891
- Georgie, love, what is wrong?
- Oh, my God! George?
- George! George!

1:14:31.974 --> 1:14:35.019
- He's not dead, Mom. He just
took two sleeping pills.
- George, baby.

1:14:35.144 --> 1:14:37.688
- Are you all right?
- He took them both?
- You gave him sleeping pills?

1:14:37.813 --> 1:14:42.150
He said he could not sleep, but
two Vatsnik is like, ''Good-bye,
George, see you next Thursday.''

1:14:42.275 --> 1:14:44.652
- George! Oh, my! George!
- I didn't think he would
take them both, you know.

1:14:44.778 --> 1:14:48.323
- Look at him! He's like--
- Truth is, I take half
a Vatsnik and I'm a goner.
- Honey!

1:14:48.448 --> 1:14:50.908
- He took them both at once?
- Looked that way to me.

1:14:51.033 --> 1:14:54.245
Well, at least he'll sleep,
you know. Matthew, help me
get him into the living room.

1:14:54.370 --> 1:14:56.663
- Can I help in some way?
- No, no, no. We men can do it.

1:14:56.789 --> 1:15:00.334
- On three we lift, Matthew.
- Okay.
- One, two, and we go.

1:15:00.459 --> 1:15:04.462
- George?
- Oh!

1:15:04.629 --> 1:15:07.131
Drop that boy on me.
Am I moving?

1:15:07.257 --> 1:15:11.010
- Oh, yes, you're moving.
- Oh, that's good.
- Oh, dear. Oh, Franck.

1:15:11.093 --> 1:15:13.179
- Going down.
- Oh, God, are you all right?
- Am I getting shorter?

1:15:13.262 --> 1:15:15.389
- Oh, no.
- Help me, baby.
- Second strength.
- Okay. Okay.

1:15:15.514 --> 1:15:17.391
Okay.

1:15:19.142 --> 1:15:21.019
- Franck?
- Yeah?
- Is he breathing?

1:15:21.103 --> 1:15:25.523
- Yes, breathing and drooling.
- Oh, honey. Oh, dear.

1:15:25.648 --> 1:15:27.775
- There you go!
- Oh! Oh!
- Mom?

1:15:27.900 --> 1:15:31.028
Oh, what are Vatsnik anyway? I've never
heard of it. Are they prescription?

1:15:31.070 --> 1:15:34.073
Not yet. They're from my country.
They're not exactly legal.

1:15:34.198 --> 1:15:37.910
But trust me,
there are no funny side effects.
I've been taking them for years.

1:15:38.035 --> 1:15:42.247
Oh, yeah. Okay. He's going to be fine.
Don't you worry.

1:15:42.414 --> 1:15:45.458
- Um, Mom?
- Well, if he's so fine,
why are you taking his pulse?

1:15:45.542 --> 1:15:48.711
- Mom!
- Well, just to check it.
Pulse excellent. See? He's fine.

1:15:48.795 --> 1:15:52.590
- He'll just sleep like
a little lamb. Okay.
- Oh, George.
- Nina!

1:15:52.715 --> 1:15:56.343
- What?
- Mom, this is it.
I'm not kidding this time.

1:15:56.427 --> 1:15:59.763
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm gonna have this baby tonight.

1:15:59.930 --> 1:16:02.724
All right, Franck. Franck,
we need you to drive us to the hospital.

1:16:02.766 --> 1:16:04.768
- No, no! No, no!
- I'm too big to get
behind the wheel, Franck.

1:16:07.270 --> 1:16:11.065
Franck! Franck! Franck,
we need you. Could you drive us
to the hospital, Franck?

1:16:11.190 --> 1:16:13.692
Huh? Okay. Thank you.

1:16:13.818 --> 1:16:16.653
Yes, the hospital.
I'll drive you there.

1:16:16.779 --> 1:16:18.864
- I'll take the suitcase.
- Okay, come on. Come on. Let's go.
- I'll be there in a moment.

1:16:18.947 --> 1:16:22.367
- Hurry up. Hurry.
- Ladies, not to worry.
We have no problem.

1:16:22.450 --> 1:16:25.870
- Good. Then hurry.
- Hey, Mom, can I drive?
- No.

1:16:25.954 --> 1:16:28.956
George! Wake up!
Please, wake up!

1:16:29.082 --> 1:16:31.250
You're gonna be
a grandpappala.

1:16:31.375 --> 1:16:36.046
Oh, George, don't do this!
I am not a husband! I am not
a father! I'm not a 9-1-1 man!

1:16:36.130 --> 1:16:40.675
Come on. Rise and shine,
you big white-haired man.

1:16:40.842 --> 1:16:43.345
There we go. All right. Look at that.
All right. Okay.

1:16:43.470 --> 1:16:47.599
We're on our way! All right.
Now-- oh, now we're clippin'.

1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:51.602
Right, left.
Right, left.

1:16:51.727 --> 1:16:55.272
Left, right. Right.

1:16:55.397 --> 1:16:58.358
We're clippin' along, George.

1:17:00.193 --> 1:17:03.947
Oh, no. Oh, George.
We're almost there!

1:17:04.072 --> 1:17:07.992
And we move. Okay.
And a running start.

1:17:10.203 --> 1:17:13.581
On the Atchison, Topeka--

1:17:13.706 --> 1:17:16.208
There! Moving.
Moving, George.

1:17:16.333 --> 1:17:18.585
Ohh!

1:17:18.710 --> 1:17:20.670
Gee, I'd change this room.

1:17:20.796 --> 1:17:23.840
This is not the time
to think about that! Let's get the head.

1:17:23.965 --> 1:17:27.802
Okay, okay.
Any day now!

1:17:27.885 --> 1:17:29.971
We're on our way!

1:17:31.931 --> 1:17:35.809
Look who's up!
He wouldn't miss it for the world.

1:17:41.148 --> 1:17:43.024
Franck! Wrong way!

1:17:46.986 --> 1:17:49.530
Right turn here.
Right!

1:17:52.867 --> 1:17:54.952
How's the maternity
department doing?

1:17:54.994 --> 1:17:57.413
I'm hangin' in there.
Just hurry, please.

1:18:01.583 --> 1:18:04.711
- George, get ahold of yourself!
- Make a left here!

1:18:04.836 --> 1:18:07.130
- Where?
- Left here!
- Left here!
- Oh, right!

1:18:22.561 --> 1:18:25.772
Hey, man,
what's with that face, huh?

1:18:25.897 --> 1:18:28.483
Is that supposed to be me?

1:18:32.737 --> 1:18:36.448
Hey, you got a problem,
loser?

1:18:36.573 --> 1:18:39.701
We have no problem with nobody!
Just ''leaf'' us alone!

1:18:39.826 --> 1:18:43.747
''Leaf'' you alone?
What are you, a tree?

1:18:45.582 --> 1:18:49.377
Yes, I am. That's very funny.
Ha, ha, ha. You're obviously a comedian.

1:18:49.502 --> 1:18:51.796
Very good.
Don't nobody look at them.

1:18:51.921 --> 1:18:56.342
Hey, that's a nice accent, man.
What planet are you from, huh?

1:18:56.467 --> 1:19:01.763
What planet? The planet of not
wanting to die by a drive-by shooting!

1:19:01.888 --> 1:19:04.682
Lock the doors!
Quick! Quick!

1:19:07.477 --> 1:19:10.104
Where ya goin', man?

1:19:14.441 --> 1:19:16.610
You all right?
Now just breathe in and out.

1:19:16.735 --> 1:19:18.695
- Yeah.
- Breathe slowly.

1:19:20.739 --> 1:19:25.076
Yes, thank you. I will. I'm just not
used to all this hod-rodding business.

1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:28.371
- She was talkin' to my sister.
- Oh.

1:19:37.171 --> 1:19:42.259
Look who's walking all by himself!
Let's go over here, George.

1:19:42.384 --> 1:19:45.428
Oh, George, honey. It's really
happening. This is it. Now, Franck.

1:19:45.512 --> 1:19:47.680
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna go upstairs with
Annie to meet her doctor.

1:19:47.805 --> 1:19:49.932
- Sure.
- So I want you and Matty
to get George some coffee.

1:19:50.099 --> 1:19:52.852
- And then I'll meet you in
the waiting room, all right?
- Of course! No problem! Yes.

1:19:52.977 --> 1:19:56.271
- How are you doing?
- I have the chair
for the prostate exam.

1:19:56.355 --> 1:20:00.275
- Mr. Lemisch?
- He'll be out in a sec.
He's in the john.

1:20:00.359 --> 1:20:03.945
Oakhurst Emergency.
Slow down. Slow down.

1:20:04.029 --> 1:20:07.282
Oh, Mr. Lemisch.

1:20:07.323 --> 1:20:09.450
- You all ready?
- Oh, yeah.

1:20:09.575 --> 1:20:12.328
People, please, we got a pregnant
lady here. Can we get a move on?

1:20:12.328 --> 1:20:14.622
- Buddy, we got it covered.
Are you doin' okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1:20:14.747 --> 1:20:17.374
- The contractions are
about five minutes apart.
- Okay, hold on.

1:20:17.499 --> 1:20:20.377
This chariot's gonna move.
You gonna need a chair too?

1:20:20.502 --> 1:20:24.089
- No, no. I'm fine.
- Annie, see you after?
- Definitely. Bye.

1:20:24.172 --> 1:20:26.799
Okay, keep breathing.
You're gonna be just fine.

1:20:30.261 --> 1:20:32.596
- Where your father go?
- I don't know. He was just here.

1:20:39.978 --> 1:20:43.148
Bring him on in.
I'm ready.

1:20:48.653 --> 1:20:52.656
Excuse me!
Do I know you?

1:20:54.742 --> 1:20:56.660
Come on, Annie.
Come on.

1:20:56.785 --> 1:21:00.122
Keep breathing.
It's almost over.

1:21:00.205 --> 1:21:02.999
Almost.

1:21:03.083 --> 1:21:06.753
Okay, the worst is over.
Almost gone, honey.

1:21:08.254 --> 1:21:10.173
You did it.

1:21:11.882 --> 1:21:14.301
- Doin' real good, Ann.
- Thanks.

1:21:14.385 --> 1:21:17.888
Look who's back
from the dead.

1:21:17.971 --> 1:21:22.309
- Hi.
- Oh, honey.
- Dad, you're up.

1:21:22.434 --> 1:21:25.019
Matthew and I are gonna go
to the cafeteria for some Coca-Colas.

1:21:25.061 --> 1:21:27.814
So, ju-- You just--

1:21:29.982 --> 1:21:33.277
- How're you doing?
- Okay.
- So far, so good.

1:21:33.402 --> 1:21:36.488
We called Bryan and he checked out of
his hotel, but nobody knows where he is.

1:21:36.572 --> 1:21:39.241
And Dr. Brooks--
Wait a minute.

1:21:41.952 --> 1:21:45.205
- You hang on.
- Dr. Brooks's kid broke
her arm at camp...

1:21:45.330 --> 1:21:48.499
- so he had to fly
to Maine this morning.
- Dr. Brooks is in Maine?

1:21:48.583 --> 1:21:50.293
Yeah.

1:21:50.418 --> 1:21:53.963
- Hi, Annie. I'm Dr. Eisenberg.
- Hi.

1:21:54.088 --> 1:21:56.256
- Let's see how you're doin' here, okay?
- Okay.

1:21:56.382 --> 1:21:58.800
I'll be filling in
for Dr. Brooks today.

1:21:58.926 --> 1:22:02.053
- And you're Annie's--
- Oh.
- Parents.

1:22:02.137 --> 1:22:04.764
You're, uh-- Y-You're, uh--
Y-You-re-- You're gonna, uh, actually--

1:22:04.931 --> 1:22:08.142
Yes, I am. Annie, actually,
everything looks real good here,

1:22:08.226 --> 1:22:10.895
so I'm just gonna check now to see what
kind of progress you're making, okay?

1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:14.481
- Okay.
- We'll wait outside.

1:22:14.607 --> 1:22:18.235
Nina, this is-- this is no good.
We got to get another doctor.
She looks younger than Annie.

1:22:18.318 --> 1:22:20.237
- Do you have any change?
- No, George. Anyway,

1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:22.239
Dr. Brooks said she's
absolutely fantastic.

1:22:22.322 --> 1:22:24.240
- Nina, this is our daughter
we're talking about.
- Hey, I know.

1:22:24.324 --> 1:22:26.159
What if something goes wrong?
I mean, how much experience...

1:22:26.284 --> 1:22:28.161
- could she have six months
out of medical school?
- Well--

1:22:28.328 --> 1:22:30.246
- Did you see the name
on her tag? Megan.
- Yes.

1:22:30.329 --> 1:22:32.748
- No real doctor is named Megan.
- Hey.
- I mean, what, uh-- what--

1:22:32.873 --> 1:22:36.668
- How many babies could she
have delivered, two?
- Actually, 341.

1:22:36.752 --> 1:22:39.546
Not counting the two
I delivered this morning.

1:22:39.713 --> 1:22:42.966
- You can come back in now.
- Well, thank you.

1:22:43.091 --> 1:22:46.261
Annie's doing great. Now,
the contractions are still irregular,

1:22:46.344 --> 1:22:50.181
but they're getting kind of intense,
so it could take just a few more hours.

1:22:50.306 --> 1:22:55.144
So just, um, just remind her
now to relax between contractions, okay?

1:22:55.227 --> 1:22:57.271
- You're going somewhere?
- Oh, just down the hall, Mr. Banks.

1:22:57.396 --> 1:22:59.273
Oh, hey, you're
wearing Sidekicks.

1:22:59.356 --> 1:23:01.274
- Oh, don't you love 'em?
They're all I wear.
- Yeah, me too.

1:23:01.399 --> 1:23:03.318
Yeah, well,
they're the best.

1:23:03.443 --> 1:23:05.445
So when's your baby due,
Mrs. Banks?

1:23:07.113 --> 1:23:09.949
- Uh--
- Are you okay?
- Oh, no, I feel fine.

1:23:09.991 --> 1:23:13.786
It's just, uh, I have
this funny pain. It's kinda sharp.

1:23:13.911 --> 1:23:18.624
- You're almost 40 weeks?
- Mm-hmm. Uh, uh-oh. Here's another one.

1:23:18.665 --> 1:23:20.667
Okay, let's go across the hall.
I'll see what's going on.

1:23:20.792 --> 1:23:23.044
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, no, I'm perfectly fine.

1:23:23.169 --> 1:23:25.255
- Really.
- I'd feel much better really
if you let me take a look.

1:23:25.338 --> 1:23:29.467
- And Mr. Banks can stay with Annie.
- Oh, I'll be right back.

1:23:29.592 --> 1:23:31.844
- Okay? Don't worry.
- Okay?
- Honey, fine.

1:23:31.927 --> 1:23:33.804
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1:23:35.597 --> 1:23:37.975
The doctor seems
pretty together.

1:23:38.141 --> 1:23:40.227
- She's young.
- Well, so what? So are you.

1:23:40.352 --> 1:23:43.647
Doesn't mean you couldn't
design a skyscraper.

1:23:43.772 --> 1:23:46.733
- All right. All right.
- Just tell me when it's over, will you?

1:23:46.816 --> 1:23:50.653
Okay, you're doing great.
Just breathe in. And now breathe out.

1:23:50.736 --> 1:23:53.239
- Breathe out.
- I can't.

1:23:53.364 --> 1:23:56.033
Okay, the worst is over.

1:23:56.158 --> 1:23:58.952
- You're sure?
- Absolutely. Coming down, way down.

1:23:59.036 --> 1:24:02.622
It's almost over.
Down to nothing. There we are.

1:24:02.706 --> 1:24:07.168
Okay. Okay. I'm okay.

1:24:07.293 --> 1:24:09.837
That was short, but horrible.

1:24:09.962 --> 1:24:13.299
- Annie, can I steal
your dad for a second?
- Yeah.

1:24:13.424 --> 1:24:16.260
- You're hanging in there?
- Mm-hmm.

1:24:16.343 --> 1:24:18.178
Okay.

1:24:22.474 --> 1:24:25.810
- Save my seat.
- I will. Hurry.

1:24:32.108 --> 1:24:35.194
- Mr. Banks, your wife is in labor.
- Very funny. Where is she?

1:24:35.361 --> 1:24:37.863
She's putting on a gown and getting
hooked up to a fetal monitor.

1:24:37.946 --> 1:24:40.741
No, no, no, no. My-My daughter's
in labor. My son-in-law's not here.

1:24:40.866 --> 1:24:44.786
And my wife is the solid one
that will--

1:24:44.911 --> 1:24:47.205
Are you sure? We have a lot
of false alarms in our family.

1:24:47.330 --> 1:24:49.582
Her cervix is already dilated
five centimeters.

1:24:49.624 --> 1:24:53.419
Now, the way she's going, your baby
could be born before your grandchild.

1:24:53.502 --> 1:24:56.755
Now, I'm okay.
I can handle this. Can you?

1:24:56.880 --> 1:25:01.134
Okay. Why don't you go congratulate
Mrs. Banks and I'll check on Annie.

1:25:01.259 --> 1:25:03.678
You know, it's pretty cool, actually.
If they both deliver before midnight,

1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:05.680
they'll have the same birthday.

1:25:05.763 --> 1:25:08.224
Dr. Eisenberg,

1:25:08.349 --> 1:25:12.353
these women are my life.

1:25:12.436 --> 1:25:14.271
I know.

1:25:24.572 --> 1:25:27.909
Nice timing, I know.
How's Ann?

1:25:28.034 --> 1:25:30.077
Well, she's doing good.
How 'bout you?

1:25:30.161 --> 1:25:32.913
Oh, George, I haven't
packed my bag.

1:25:33.038 --> 1:25:37.084
We haven't even practiced
that Lamaze stuff yet. It's just--

1:25:37.251 --> 1:25:40.295
Oh!

1:25:40.420 --> 1:25:42.756
- You're having a contraction, huh?
- Yeah, I know.

1:25:44.215 --> 1:25:47.051
- Yeow.
- You okay?

1:25:50.096 --> 1:25:53.933
Just promise me-- promise me you'll stay
with Annie, George. She needs you.

1:25:54.099 --> 1:25:56.393
- You know I will.
- Okay.

1:25:56.518 --> 1:25:58.979
- Nina.
- What?

1:25:59.146 --> 1:26:01.481
We're gonna have
a baby tonight.

1:26:01.648 --> 1:26:03.525
I know.

1:26:03.650 --> 1:26:06.152
Isn't it just amazing?

1:26:10.072 --> 1:26:12.867
You know, we haven't even
locked in on any names yet.

1:26:12.992 --> 1:26:15.744
Ah, okay.
Now, I was thinking...

1:26:15.828 --> 1:26:19.623
Megan if it's a girl,
and Franck if it's a boy.

1:26:19.748 --> 1:26:23.376
Franck Banks. It's got kind of a
continental ring to it, don't you think?

1:26:23.501 --> 1:26:26.588
Can't you see him walking around
the house with his little ascot?

1:26:26.671 --> 1:26:28.756
George, go check on Annie.

1:26:28.881 --> 1:26:31.717
Tell her I'm fine, all right?
Oh, boy.

1:26:31.842 --> 1:26:35.012
These contractions are
really coming fast, honey.

1:26:35.179 --> 1:26:39.057
But go, go. I'm fine.
And, oh, check on Matty, honey.

1:26:39.182 --> 1:26:42.602
And, George? George.

1:26:46.898 --> 1:26:49.942
I don't know what
I was gonna say.

1:26:55.489 --> 1:26:57.366
Okay.

1:27:00.118 --> 1:27:02.704
Okay, hang in there.
A little more.

1:27:02.829 --> 1:27:07.083
- That one was a bitch, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1:27:07.208 --> 1:27:09.210
- Pappala, we're getting closer.
- How're you doin'?
- Hi.
- You okay?

1:27:09.293 --> 1:27:11.504
- Yes, that's better. Thanks.
- Fine. Good.
- Dad, how's Mom?

1:27:11.587 --> 1:27:14.089
Well, uh, sh-she's, uh--
You're not gonna believe this.

1:27:14.173 --> 1:27:18.010
- She's not in labor?
- She is, actually.

1:27:18.177 --> 1:27:21.471
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- This is some night.

1:27:21.555 --> 1:27:23.473
- More ice.
- I'll get it!
- I'll get it!
- No, no, no. I'll get it.

1:27:23.556 --> 1:27:26.809
- All right.
- You just, uh-- You just stay there.
- Dad, you should--

1:27:26.893 --> 1:27:28.978
- Hold on.
- I got you. I got you.

1:27:29.061 --> 1:27:31.397
Go to Mom. I'll be fine.

1:27:31.522 --> 1:27:34.942
- The ice man arrives.
- Almost. Almost. Almost. There we are.

1:27:35.067 --> 1:27:37.194
There we go. More ice.

1:27:37.319 --> 1:27:40.030
Really, Dad, I can handle this now.
You stay with Mom.

1:27:40.072 --> 1:27:45.285
Well, she did say she wanted
some ice. I could take this to
her and be back in two seconds.

1:27:45.368 --> 1:27:48.413
- How about I find a doctor and get
an update here, okay? Be right back.
- Okay.

1:27:48.496 --> 1:27:51.666
- You just-- You just--
- Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

1:27:51.749 --> 1:27:55.336
- Oh! This is very good.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1:27:57.421 --> 1:28:00.841
- Franck. I need you, buddy.
- I'm here, buddy.

1:28:00.924 --> 1:28:04.219
- Anything. What?
- W-Well, I need you to help me.
Can you hang in here with me?

1:28:04.302 --> 1:28:07.221
Of course. I will hang in
until I hear those babies cry.

1:28:07.347 --> 1:28:10.808
I don't know what I'm doing exactly, but
I will keep doing that. You know that.

1:28:10.933 --> 1:28:12.810
- Well, I thought you
could stay with Annie.
- Good.

1:28:12.935 --> 1:28:15.521
-And then I could check on Nina.
-Fine.
-Then maybe we could switch.

1:28:15.604 --> 1:28:17.981
Yeah. George?

1:28:18.148 --> 1:28:20.275
We're bonding here,
aren't we?

1:28:20.442 --> 1:28:24.279
- I think we are, Franck.
- Someone's buzzing me
awful bad in here.

1:28:24.446 --> 1:28:26.739
Go on. Don't worry.
I'm on the case.

1:28:28.116 --> 1:28:32.787
Okay. Oh, George. George?
I think I'm almost there.

1:28:32.912 --> 1:28:35.414
Yeah, Dad, don't go too far.
We may need you.

1:28:35.497 --> 1:28:39.584
Dad? Dad!

1:28:41.253 --> 1:28:46.466
- We're moving her into delivery.
- Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it.

1:28:46.549 --> 1:28:50.178
- Dad?
- Baby.

1:28:52.304 --> 1:28:55.099
Doctor.

1:28:57.434 --> 1:29:00.103
What's going on?
What's wrong?

1:29:00.145 --> 1:29:02.564
Nina, your contractions
are really close together...

1:29:02.731 --> 1:29:05.775
and the baby's just not handling
it as well as we'd like.

1:29:05.900 --> 1:29:08.569
The baby's heart rate has dropped.
Now, we're gonna watch it carefully...

1:29:08.653 --> 1:29:11.489
and if it doesn't go back up in a couple
of minutes, I wanna do a C-section...

1:29:11.656 --> 1:29:16.243
- and get the baby out.
- Oh, George.

1:29:16.326 --> 1:29:19.579
Mr. Banks, I'm concerned
your wife's going to need to
be delivered in the next few minutes...

1:29:19.705 --> 1:29:22.415
- and obviously I can't be
in two places at once.
- Right.

1:29:22.499 --> 1:29:25.710
Everything's going beautifully
with Annie. Her labor's
progressing very well.

1:29:25.835 --> 1:29:28.671
I'd like to turn her over
to the chief resident.

1:29:28.796 --> 1:29:30.464
I have complete
confidence in him.

1:29:30.548 --> 1:29:33.467
I just feel that it's more important
that I stay with your wife.

1:29:33.509 --> 1:29:36.095
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah, fine.

1:29:36.136 --> 1:29:38.347
If the baby's heart rate doesn't go up,
how long does it take to--

1:29:38.472 --> 1:29:43.768
Once I get her in the operating
room, I can have the baby out
in 60 seconds if I have to.

1:29:43.852 --> 1:29:47.063
We're still okay.

1:29:47.146 --> 1:29:49.315
- We're in labor in room number four.
- Okay.

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:52.068
- Get Dr. Wagner up here.
- Right.

1:30:01.618 --> 1:30:04.996
- Dad! Is Mom okay?
- She's fine. Don't worry.

1:30:05.163 --> 1:30:07.373
- Okay.
- Hi, Annie. I'm Dr. Wagner.

1:30:07.457 --> 1:30:10.418
- Hi.
- Hold on. We're almost there.
- Okay.

1:30:14.004 --> 1:30:16.131
- Bryan!
- Annie!

1:30:16.215 --> 1:30:18.967
Oh. Oh, God.

1:30:19.051 --> 1:30:21.970
- I hope he's the husband.
- He is.

1:30:25.849 --> 1:30:28.684
- How'd you know we were here?
- Well, I got to the folks' house...

1:30:28.851 --> 1:30:30.937
and saw the tray
of uneaten lasagna.

1:30:31.062 --> 1:30:33.689
- I'm so glad I made it.
- Me too.

1:30:33.731 --> 1:30:37.484
Slow down, kids.
This is our stop.

1:30:42.906 --> 1:30:44.824
Dad, if--

1:30:45.867 --> 1:30:47.952
- Just go. Go.
- Okay.

1:30:56.502 --> 1:31:00.005
I don't see enough of an improvement,
Nina. Let's get you delivered.

1:31:00.088 --> 1:31:02.841
- Pat, we're on our way.
- Okay.

1:31:02.882 --> 1:31:06.511
- Nina.
- Oh, George.

1:31:06.594 --> 1:31:09.847
What if she doesn't
get the baby out in time?

1:31:09.931 --> 1:31:13.767
- She will.
- Excuse me.

1:31:13.851 --> 1:31:15.894
- Hey, you know what I
was thinkin' about?
- What?

1:31:15.978 --> 1:31:18.564
- I was thinkin' about our first date.
- Oh, yeah.

1:31:18.647 --> 1:31:20.941
The one you showed up
an hour late for?

1:31:21.108 --> 1:31:24.819
- Oh, actually, I wasn't an hour late.
- Yes, you were, George.

1:31:24.903 --> 1:31:27.238
You showed up as I was pulling
away from the restaurant.

1:31:27.363 --> 1:31:30.992
Well, that's not exactly
what happened.

1:31:31.117 --> 1:31:34.662
Actually, I got there on time.
I told you this.

1:31:34.787 --> 1:31:36.413
- Never.
- I didn't?

1:31:39.041 --> 1:31:44.754
Remember, you told me I'd know
you because you'd be wearing
that red turtleneck?

1:31:44.838 --> 1:31:47.423
- Oh, George.
- And I just...

1:31:47.590 --> 1:31:52.678
stood in the window and I watched
you walk to that booth in the back.

1:31:52.803 --> 1:31:56.181
And you were so
incredibly beautiful.

1:31:56.306 --> 1:31:58.892
I was afraid to go in.
And I--

1:31:58.976 --> 1:32:01.061
- And I just stood there,
- Excuse me.

1:32:01.186 --> 1:32:05.148
watching you sip your water
and talk to the waiter,

1:32:05.273 --> 1:32:08.359
and I just fell in love
with you.

1:32:09.610 --> 1:32:11.195
George.

1:32:13.531 --> 1:32:17.993
And when you left, I watched you
get in your V.W. bug...

1:32:18.035 --> 1:32:22.330
and I saw your hair blowing out
the side of the window, and--

1:32:22.414 --> 1:32:26.417
and you started to drive off, and I
just got afraid I'd never see you again.

1:32:26.584 --> 1:32:29.670
That's when I almost
ran you over.

1:32:32.256 --> 1:32:35.467
Thanks for telling me this,
George.

1:32:35.592 --> 1:32:38.303
Thanks for marrying me, Nina.

1:32:39.721 --> 1:32:42.432
We're ready.

1:33:41.570 --> 1:33:44.697
Dad, it's a boy.
We have a son.

1:33:47.158 --> 1:33:49.660
Congratulations.
How's Annie?

1:33:49.744 --> 1:33:51.996
Perfect.
She's just perfect.

1:33:52.079 --> 1:33:55.416
He's so cute.
Seven pounds, nine ounces.

1:33:55.582 --> 1:33:58.544
- How's Nina?
- I'm, uh, still waiting.

1:33:58.669 --> 1:34:01.171
Yeah. Well, I guess
I-I better get back.

1:34:01.213 --> 1:34:04.132
- Go.
- Okay.

1:34:04.299 --> 1:34:07.093
It's wonderful.
Give Annie a kiss for me.

1:34:07.260 --> 1:34:09.137
I will.

1:34:17.227 --> 1:34:19.146
I'm a grandfather.

1:34:22.941 --> 1:34:25.110
Mr. Banks?

1:34:28.196 --> 1:34:31.073
I have someone
that I'd like you to meet.

1:34:38.956 --> 1:34:41.208
It's a girl.

1:34:41.333 --> 1:34:44.044
I love girls.

1:34:44.169 --> 1:34:47.422
- How's Nina?
- She's excellent. She did beautifully.

1:34:55.012 --> 1:34:58.849
Am I nuts, or is this
the most beautiful baby ever born?

1:34:58.974 --> 1:35:00.851
She's perfect.

1:35:02.811 --> 1:35:06.439
Oh. Would you tell Nina
she has a grandson?

1:35:08.149 --> 1:35:11.277
I will. Congratulations.

1:35:11.444 --> 1:35:14.238
And thanks.

1:35:16.156 --> 1:35:18.075
My pleasure.

1:35:21.953 --> 1:35:24.706
Hey. Hey.

1:35:25.957 --> 1:35:28.543
Hi, beauty. Hi.

1:35:34.256 --> 1:35:36.800
Dad, you gotta see him.

1:35:39.094 --> 1:35:41.513
Annie says he looks
just like you.

1:35:41.596 --> 1:35:44.140
- Come here, you.
- Boy.

1:35:44.224 --> 1:35:46.643
- Oh, that's yours?
- She's a daughter.

1:35:46.768 --> 1:35:51.105
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- Say. Say.

1:36:08.287 --> 1:36:13.042
It was at that moment, with my daughter
in one arm and my grandson in the other,

1:36:13.167 --> 1:36:16.128
that I realized life isn't
gonna get much better than this.

1:36:20.215 --> 1:36:23.301
- Oh, there he is.
- Oh, let me see him.

1:36:23.426 --> 1:36:25.970
- Ohh!
- Hi, Dad. Mom.

1:36:26.137 --> 1:36:29.015
- There they are.
- Oh, my God. They're so sweet!

1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:34.770
Hello!

1:36:38.315 --> 1:36:42.110
Before we knew it,
two months had passed,

1:36:42.235 --> 1:36:44.863
and it was time
to say good-bye.

1:36:46.948 --> 1:36:49.867
Have you got the stroller?

1:36:50.076 --> 1:36:51.869
I guess we're off.

1:36:54.830 --> 1:36:57.624
That's it.

1:36:57.749 --> 1:37:00.043
Mom?

1:37:00.168 --> 1:37:02.045
- Oh, honey.
- I'll miss you.

1:37:02.087 --> 1:37:05.215
- Knock 'em dead, okay?
- Okay, I'll try.

1:37:05.340 --> 1:37:08.551
- Let me hug George good-bye,
okay? Can I?
- Ohh. Yeah.

1:37:08.634 --> 1:37:12.763
- Hi. Hi. Are you George?
Oh, you're George.
- Can I get a little hug?

1:37:12.930 --> 1:37:14.807
- Can I hold him?
- Huh?
- Yeah, sure.

1:37:14.932 --> 1:37:18.602
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- All right, honey. Okay.

1:37:18.769 --> 1:37:21.354
- Two hands.
- Two hands.
- Two hands.

1:37:22.772 --> 1:37:24.691
Yes. Good.

1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:30.780
- Well.
- Well, good-bye. Take care.

1:37:30.947 --> 1:37:33.908
- Bye.
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

1:37:35.784 --> 1:37:37.911
See you, George.

1:37:37.953 --> 1:37:39.871
We'll call ya.

1:37:42.999 --> 1:37:46.461
Bye, Megan.
Call me, okay?

1:37:46.586 --> 1:37:49.255
I may be your nephew's mother,
but I'm still your big sister.

1:37:55.761 --> 1:37:59.640
- Here. I got her a going-away present.
- Hey. Okay.

1:38:06.271 --> 1:38:08.189
Thanks.

1:38:08.356 --> 1:38:11.275
You better get going if you're
gonna get to Phoenix before dark.

1:38:11.442 --> 1:38:14.403
Yeah, we better.

1:38:14.445 --> 1:38:18.115
Okay, well, remember. If you're
ever up for a 3:00 a.m. feeding,
it'll be 6:00 in Boston.

1:38:18.198 --> 1:38:20.909
So, you know,
don't hesitate.

1:38:27.206 --> 1:38:30.376
- I'll take him. Oh, sleepy.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1:38:30.501 --> 1:38:33.546
I haven't had a chance to kiss
my grandson good-bye yet.

1:38:33.629 --> 1:38:35.506
Hey, buddy.

1:38:38.675 --> 1:38:41.761
I got ya. I got ya.

1:38:41.887 --> 1:38:45.557
We are named well, George.
Don't let the other kids tease
you. It's a good, solid name.

1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:48.518
- His last name's not Zenkman, is it?
- No.

1:38:48.559 --> 1:38:52.313
Well, good. Hmm? Oh!
Oh, he got me.

1:38:52.396 --> 1:38:55.482
Got me. Do it again.
Hey, do it again. Come on.

1:38:55.566 --> 1:38:58.068
Oh! He got me.

1:38:58.193 --> 1:39:00.070
Oh!

1:39:01.488 --> 1:39:04.657
Hey. Yeah, I got ya.
I got ya.

1:39:14.166 --> 1:39:16.543
Well, I guess we gotta go.

1:39:20.422 --> 1:39:23.800
- Bye.
- I'll take him, George.
- Okay.

1:39:23.842 --> 1:39:27.804
- There we go.
- Bye, Matty. Be good.

1:39:27.845 --> 1:39:30.348
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

1:39:35.269 --> 1:39:37.229
- Don't forget to buckle your seat belt.
- Okay, Dad.

1:39:37.312 --> 1:39:40.190
- You too, Bryan.
- I will, Dad. So we'll
talk to you tonight?

1:39:40.315 --> 1:39:43.985
And it's hard to see out the rear view,
so go slow and let people pass you.

1:39:44.027 --> 1:39:46.487
We will, Dad.

1:39:46.529 --> 1:39:49.198
- Okay.
- Bye.

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:52.201
- Bye.
- Bye!

1:39:52.368 --> 1:39:54.286
Take care!

1:40:01.418 --> 1:40:04.045
- Bye!
- Bye!

1:40:21.103 --> 1:40:23.355
- Okay.
- ''Okay'' what?

1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:26.566
Okay, let's finish
your science project.

1:40:26.774 --> 1:40:30.236
- It's not due 'til Thursday.
- Let's get a jump on it then, huh?

1:41:10.773 --> 1:41:13.484
I don't look too old
to be your father, do I?

1:41:15.819 --> 1:41:19.448
Hey, you're already laughing
at me. What took you so long? Hey.

1:41:20.699 --> 1:41:24.619
Bet you can't do this.
I can teach you that.

1:41:24.702 --> 1:41:26.996
I can teach you
all kinds of tricks.

1:41:27.121 --> 1:41:30.666
How to pass behind your back,
how to sink it shooting backwards.

1:41:30.791 --> 1:41:33.085
I taught your big sister.
I can teach you.

1:41:33.169 --> 1:41:35.963
Megan, you wanna see the court?
I don't think you've seen it yet.

1:41:36.046 --> 1:41:40.592
We got lights and everything.
We can play at night,
one-on-one, just you and me.

1:41:43.887 --> 1:41:48.141
Grab your coat
and get your hat

1:41:48.224 --> 1:41:52.269
Leave your worries
on the doorstep

1:41:53.395 --> 1:41:56.815
And just direct your feet

1:41:57.107 --> 1:42:01.486
To the sunny side
of the street

1:42:01.611 --> 1:42:05.615
Can't you hear the pitter-pat

1:42:05.740 --> 1:42:10.661
Yeah, that happy tune
is your step

1:42:10.828 --> 1:42:14.498
Life can be so sweet

1:42:14.623 --> 1:42:18.168
On the sunny side
of the street

1:42:18.293 --> 1:42:22.797
I used to walk
in the shade

1:42:22.839 --> 1:42:27.427
With my blues on parade

1:42:27.552 --> 1:42:31.847
But now I'm not afraid

1:42:31.972 --> 1:42:36.060
'Cause this rover
has crossed over

1:42:36.226 --> 1:42:40.522
If I never have a cent

1:42:40.647 --> 1:42:44.901
I'll be rich
as that Trump fella

1:42:45.068 --> 1:42:49.530
There'll be gold
where I step my feet

1:42:49.655 --> 1:42:52.366
On the sunny side

1:42:53.951 --> 1:42:58.205
On the sunny side
of the street
