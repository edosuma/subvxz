Yes, but that's not the point.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.211
Why didn't you go meet them?

12:32.336 --> 12:34.672
'Cause I'm in the zone.
They can come to me.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.932
You have to tell them
what you've been up to.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.344
I will when the time's right.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.806
Just tell them. Explain it.
They'll be supportive.

13:00.698 --> 13:02.324

13:02.408 --> 13:05.202

13:08.581 --> 13:09.915

13:10.040 --> 13:11.667
So she probably
kept investigating

13:11.750 --> 13:13.377
after she was suspended.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.215
Beth never let anything go.

her a good cop.

13:25.890 --> 13:27.725

- Beer?
- No, thanks. On duty.

13:36.192 --> 13:37.985
I didn't think
the union did home visits.

- Just skimmed it.

Well, now,
you're off the case.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.106
But you keep digging,
and digging and digging.

14:16.607 --> 14:20.444

you keep picking at this scab?

But we've crossed a line,
you and me.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.211
And there's
really no going back.

14:38.462 --> 14:43.133
Because I have
to keep everyone that I care about safe.

14:43.676 --> 14:47.137
And you want that, too,
don't you, Beth?

14:52.810 --> 14:53.978
Anything?

14:54.979 --> 14:56.355
Not a damn thing.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.482
Nothing in the

15:04.905 --> 15:08.200
So she was onto Neolution.
Probably through MK.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.369
And she met Leekie.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.893
I think there's something
inside me. I need a torch.

41:58.976 --> 42:01.353
Slow down.
Tell me what happened.

42:01.437 --> 42:02.813
They have these
implant things.

42:03.272 --> 42:05.024
And these Neos, they attacked me.

42:05.107 --> 42:06.567
- They were looking for MK.
- What?

42:06.650 --> 42:07.693
And I think

42:07.776 --> 42:08.795
- there's something in my jaw.
- Okay, okay.

42:08.819 --> 42:10.946
- Here.
- Easy, let's have a look.

42:21.290 --> 42:22.791
(GASPS)

42:24.043 --> 42:25.586
(SOFTLY) Jesus, Sarah.

42:25.669 --> 42:27.171
What is that?

42:29.381 --> 42:30.799
I don't know.

42:32.468 --> 42:35.471
(BREATH TREMBLING)
I don't know.

42:36.639 --> 42:38.307
ALISON: <i>What is that
God-forsaken thing?</i>

42:38.807 --> 42:40.976
<i>- Is it harming Sarah?</i>
- SCOTT: Holy cow!

42:41.060 --> 42:42.436
It looks like
it's latched on.

42:42.519 --> 42:44.772
Oh, you're expecting Felix!

42:45.147 --> 42:46.147
Who are you?

42:46.190 --> 42:47.233
Mrs. Hendrix?

42:47.316 --> 42:48.901
We're investigating
a triple homicide

42:48.984 --> 42:50.819
in a local garage
a few weeks back.

42:50.903 --> 42:53.614
WOMAN: <i>We all need to work
harder at being a family.</i>

42:53.697 --> 42:57.326
SARAH: <i>If I can't find MK,
I need to find this Dizzy guy.</i>

42:57.409 --> 42:58.911
<i>Maybe he knows
how to take it out.</i>

42:58.994 --> 43:01.330
All right, who the hell are you?

43:02.331 --> 43:03.582
