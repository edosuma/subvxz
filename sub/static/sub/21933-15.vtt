WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:03.904
Come on, guys.
Let's go!

00:05.473 --> 00:07.341
Hey.
Hey.

00:07.375 --> 00:10.378
You all packed up,
ready for a little vacation?

00:10.411 --> 00:12.546
Okay, well, it's not a vacation.
It's a business trip.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.648
And you're sure it's a good idea
to bring the family, right?

00:14.682 --> 00:15.683
I think
it's a great idea.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.218
We're gonna be
in Florida anyway.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.187
Why not take in the sights?
Do it right.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.755
Okay, just remember
it's a business trip first.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.724
No, I am a dad first.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.559
And that's true.
You are a good dad.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.328
No, no, no.
I'm a great dad, all right?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.629
I always look out
for my kids.

00:28.662 --> 00:29.730
Dad, have you seen
my vitamins?

00:29.763 --> 00:30.698
You don't need that crap.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.233
Everything will be taken care of
by the sun.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.601
Does it all.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.835
Go. Hurry up.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.105
So, listen, Saturday,
we're hitting Disney World

00:37.138 --> 00:38.239
if you want to join us.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.308
Oh, that's sweet,
but I'm gonna pass.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.610
I'll be laying out
sipping on a piÃ±a colada

00:42.643 --> 00:44.512
from a coconut
bigger than my head.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.547
Every coconut's
bigger than your head.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.784
What?
I can't be the first one
to tell you this,

00:50.818 --> 00:52.620
but your head
is freakishly small.

00:52.653 --> 00:53.687
You don't know this?
What?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.123
Yes.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.090
Honestly,
if you didn't have hair,

00:56.124 --> 00:58.659
you'd look like
a tan thumb.

00:58.692 --> 00:59.660
Thank you.
Wha--

00:59.693 --> 01:00.761
You just know what to say.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.763
I'm just throwing it out there.
You're bringing it up.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.332
Hey, Dad, I thought
we were getting

01:04.365 --> 01:05.533
spending money
for the trip.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.101
Yeah,
I gave you 40 bucks.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.202
What am I, Amish?

01:08.236 --> 01:09.703
N-- No.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.405
You're 15, all right?

01:11.439 --> 01:12.406
And you got to learn
to budget.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.174
Figure it out.
Come on.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.808
Hey, listen,
is Rootger coming?

01:14.842 --> 01:16.777
He seemed a little freaked out
about having to fly.

01:16.810 --> 01:17.711
Yeah, he was.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.547
I've never seen him
afraid of anything.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.548
He was all like, uh,

01:20.581 --> 01:22.150
"Uh, maybe we could take bus,

01:22.183 --> 01:24.318
you know?
Drive only 24 hours."

01:24.352 --> 01:28.556
Okay, was that Rootger
or Dracula?

01:28.589 --> 01:31.259
'Cause that was, like,
the worst Dutch accent ever.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.160
I disagree.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.194
Okay.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.295
I'm so excited.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.163
A couple days in Florida,

01:35.196 --> 01:37.431
then off to Italy
for our honeymoon.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.233
Well, I don't see
my sunscreen,

01:39.267 --> 01:40.501
so when we get to Italy,

01:40.534 --> 01:42.303
I'm gonna be bright red
and peeling.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.605
So get ready for lots
of little flakes of dead skin

01:44.638 --> 01:45.739
floating all over you.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.710
Mm, you save that sexy talk
for our first night in Rome.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.445
Besides, I got you
a new sunscreen.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.346
It's right here.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.381
Okay,
you guys ready to go?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.416
SPF 75?!

01:55.449 --> 01:57.318
You know
it has to be 150.

01:57.351 --> 02:00.654
Anything below that
is milk.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.324
Well, then we can just get some
when we get there.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.559
Well, just slap
the 75 on twice.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.561
It's like two coats.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.597
No, it --
it doesn't work like that.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.300
-We're not painting a fence.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.602
I'm here.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.238
I'm ready to go, and I'm
no longer afraid of flying.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.207
Oh, good for you,
honey.

02:19.240 --> 02:19.907
There's nothing to fear.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.475
It's irrational.
It is.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.877
Yeah, the idea of being trapped
in a metal tube

02:23.911 --> 02:26.180
as it flies
into the side of a mountain

02:26.214 --> 02:28.282
will not enter my brain.

02:28.316 --> 02:31.352
Good for you.
Let's rock and roll!

02:31.385 --> 02:32.753
I lied.

02:32.786 --> 02:37.891
* I am not your ordinary guy

02:40.394 --> 02:42.496
Hey, guys, just make sure
you get your boarding passes out

02:42.530 --> 02:44.632
so when they call us,
we're all ready to go, okay?

02:44.665 --> 02:45.799
Why are we
in different rows?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.801
I booked last minute, so we're
kind of scattered around,

02:47.835 --> 02:48.736
all right?
Don't worry.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.471
We all land together.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.640
Unless, of course,
the plane breaks up midair,

02:52.673 --> 02:55.309
and then we're scattered
around the countryside.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.747
Just watch my stuff. I got to go
to the bathroom, all right?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.284
Hi. Welcome.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.253
Hi. I heard
your announcement

03:05.286 --> 03:07.288
about getting bumped up
to first class.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.357
I was wondering how I --
how I can do that?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.658
Oh, well, you can pay
the difference

03:10.691 --> 03:12.360
or use
frequent-flyer miles.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.729
Okay, well,
I don't have any of those.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.398
Well, unless it's
a special occasion

03:17.431 --> 03:18.532
or a medical emergency,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.268
there's not much
we can do.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.403
Wait. Didn't I hear someone
from your party

03:22.436 --> 03:23.404
talking about
a honeymoon?

03:23.437 --> 03:26.240
Was that you?

03:26.274 --> 03:27.608
Yes! Yes.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.976
Actually,
I just got married.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.545
Congratulations!

03:31.579 --> 03:32.446
Thank you!

03:33.447 --> 03:34.382
Well,
is your husband here?

03:34.415 --> 03:35.983
My husband is
in the, um --

03:36.016 --> 03:37.418
in the -- in the bathroom
right now.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.786
He's got a condition.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.021
The doctors call it
"angry colon."

03:41.054 --> 03:42.823
Ooh!

03:42.856 --> 03:45.326
You know, let me see
what I can do for you.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.527
Thank -- Oh!
Sure.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.995
Thank you!

03:48.862 --> 03:49.697
-Ooh!
-Oh!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.565
I'm -- I'm so sorry.
No, I'm so sorry.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.800
No, that was totally
my fault.
No!

03:52.833 --> 03:54.268
I was checking out Cinnabon
over there,

03:54.302 --> 03:55.569
and I-I-I just lost my mind
for a second there.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.370
Sorry.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.305
Let me get this all set
for you.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.940
Well, thank you.
I mean, what a gentleman.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.609
Didn't know they had
any of those left.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.843
There's a few of us.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.313
You know what it is? We don't
like to make it about us, so...

04:05.346 --> 04:06.880
We just kind of hide
among the idiots.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.650
Well,
you mentioned Cinnabon.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.651
Look, I-I just got back
from there.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.685
I got an extra.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.321
I

04:13.354 --> 04:14.988
Yeah, I-I'd like to,
but I'm, uh --

04:15.022 --> 04:16.790
I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying
to cut back, so...

04:16.824 --> 04:18.559
Why?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.328
I don't know.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.830
See? I miss the days
where men would just, like,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.898
eat whatever they wanted,
you know,

04:24.932 --> 04:26.334
instead of
looking in the mirror

04:26.367 --> 04:28.636
and counting calories.
Yeah.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.737
But you know --
I-I'm sorry.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.904
Are you, like, a vegan
or something?

04:30.938 --> 04:31.805
No! No!

04:31.839 --> 04:33.941
I don't even like the sound
of the word.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.343
"Vegan"!

04:36.910 --> 04:38.546
Oh, you know what, uh,

04:38.579 --> 04:40.047
I got to get going,
but, uh,

04:40.080 --> 04:42.483
maybe I'll see you
on the plane or something.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.285
-I'd like that.
-Okay. Great.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.388
What?!
C'mon!

04:47.421 --> 04:48.789
They are boarding
the plane.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.823
Yeah, they called
first class only.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.793
That's right, and mama has
a surprise for you.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.495
That girl was amazing.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.397
I mean,
we just hit it off.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.297
It was crazy.

04:57.331 --> 05:00.000
Okay, well, I wouldn't get
too attached.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.402
I'm not attached,
all right?

05:01.435 --> 05:02.936
She just said
I was a gentleman.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.672
She loves Cinnabon.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.073
She likes
that I eat meat.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.341
I mean --

05:07.375 --> 05:08.409
Yeah,
I'm pretty locked in.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.443
All right.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.646
These are our seats.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.915
Isn't this great?!

05:14.948 --> 05:17.050
What?!
Yes!

05:17.084 --> 05:20.521
I worked my magic to get us
bumped up to first class.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.055
Now,
to get these seats,

05:22.089 --> 05:24.392
I kind of had to give
the impression that you and I --

05:24.425 --> 05:26.126
Oh!
Well, look who made it!

05:26.159 --> 05:26.994
How are you?
Hi.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.398
Yes. Yes, this is, uh,
my husband...

05:30.431 --> 05:33.801
Mm-hmm.
...who was indisposed before,
but now he is here.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.869
Uh, yes, about that,

05:35.903 --> 05:38.071
if you feel a little emergency
coming on

05:38.105 --> 05:40.040
and you need to move closer
to the restroom,

05:40.073 --> 05:41.141
just let us know.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.677
Okay.
Thanks.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.680
Honey, I had to tell Kristie
about your condition.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.781
My

05:47.815 --> 05:49.783
Yes, you know,
the angry colon thing.

05:49.817 --> 05:50.951
Angry...colon?

05:50.984 --> 05:53.086
My -- My colon is --
My colon's fine.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.422
It's fine.
Mm.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.724
Is it, though?

05:56.757 --> 05:59.092
Okay,
I got us some treats.
Mm!

05:59.126 --> 06:00.894
I got cheese sticks,
a Twix bar...
Mm-hmm.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.831
...and a very expensive bag
of airport grapes.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.900
Mmm! Yay, a little picnic
in the sky!

06:06.934 --> 06:09.036
Hey, uh, sorry about
getting upset

06:09.069 --> 06:11.138
about the sunscreen.
I'm -- I'm --

06:11.171 --> 06:13.674
No, no, no, my bad
for getting the wrong kind.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.875
But you know what,
that doesn't matter

06:14.908 --> 06:16.710
because we are...

06:16.744 --> 06:18.178
going on our honeymoon!
Going on our honeymoon!

06:19.680 --> 06:21.515
Uh, excuse me.
I believe that's me.

06:21.549 --> 06:24.785
Oh! Uh, actually,
today is your lucky day.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.455
My wife and I are going
on our honeymoon,

06:27.488 --> 06:29.590
so I will take the middle,
and you can enjoy

06:29.623 --> 06:31.124
all the extra leg room
in the aisle.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.527
Nah, I'm good.
I like the middle.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.028
Excuse me.
That's my seat.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.165
I meet this great girl,
and now I got to pretend

06:38.198 --> 06:39.833
to be married to you...
Okay.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.134
...with an angry colon?

06:41.168 --> 06:42.603
I just wanted
to be realistic,

06:42.636 --> 06:43.871
so I came up
with something.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.972
Realistic?
Yes.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.007
So, tell me everything.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.175
How did you two meet?

06:48.208 --> 06:50.578
I'm a neurosurgeon.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.545
Wow!
Yeah. Yeah.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.546
Honey.
No.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.747
You don't have
to tell her that.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.616
No, actually I-I-I do.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.551
See, s-she was
a patient of mine,

06:57.585 --> 06:58.819
and I-I-I fixed her.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.488
She came
with a scrambled brain,

07:00.521 --> 07:01.955
and I got it --
I got it --

07:01.989 --> 07:03.190
I got it working again.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.858
Oh.
Yeah, it wasn't easy, either...

07:04.892 --> 07:06.159
...'cause I got big hands,

07:06.193 --> 07:07.628
and as you can see,
her --

07:07.661 --> 07:08.829
her head's
kind of smallish.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.031
Okay.
All right.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.633
But I -- But I got it.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.535
Guys, that is
an incredible story.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.704
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
and that's pretty much it. So...

07:16.737 --> 07:18.839
Okay, well, these are
our signature cocktails.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.173
Oh! Thank you.
Please enjoy.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.174
Oh.
There you go.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.010
Oh, there is cream in that.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.745
That -- That's fine.
Don't worry about that.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.013
Well, I just hope
that's okay with your --

07:26.046 --> 07:27.515
It's fine.
It's fine. Don't --

07:27.548 --> 07:28.616
Your colon situation.

07:28.649 --> 07:35.856
Ya

07:35.889 --> 07:36.757
I hope you had your fun.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.692
I'm not letting
my fake marriage to you

07:38.726 --> 07:40.528
ruin my chances with her,
okay?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.229
Well, if you want to get busted,
go ahead and do it.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.664
What? What's the worst
that can happen?

07:43.697 --> 07:45.799
They throw us back in coach?
Who cares?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.668
We haven't even
taken off yet.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.236
If they find out we lied,

07:49.269 --> 07:50.704
they're gonna kick us
off the plane.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.673
What?!
Yes, they do that now.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.908
And you can kiss
your Florida sunshine goodbye.

07:54.942 --> 07:55.876
I'll tell them
it was all you.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.044
It's your fault.
Oh, really?

07:57.077 --> 07:57.945
I wasn't even involved.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.112
Oh, you weren't?
No.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.115
You're an accessory,
okay?

08:02.149 --> 08:03.817
How's that little drink?

08:03.851 --> 08:05.853
And your little
first

08:05.886 --> 08:07.054
Cozy?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.257
You're a monster.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.493
You married me.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.966
Your parents
up in first class, too?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.101
Yeah,
my dad got bumped up.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.971
Meanwhile, we're stuck
back here like animals.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.574
You're funny.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.643
Hey, do I know you?
Wait a second.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.546
You go to Berner Junior High,
right?
Yeah.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.582
You're the quarterback
for the football team!

08:34.615 --> 08:36.584
Everybody talks about you.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.018
It is you, right?

08:39.319 --> 08:40.754
Yes.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.725
You seem nervous.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.094
I wanted to take a van
to Florida.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.261
I was overruled.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.030
Oh, don't worry.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.667
Flying is statistically
the safest form of travel.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.770
Absolutely. We've been involved
in several incidents ourselves,

08:56.804 --> 08:59.573
and we came out
just fine.
Incidents?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.975
Yeah, one time, our plane
caught fire on the runway.

09:02.009 --> 09:02.943
Oh, mm-hmm.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.745
All this stuff was leaking
out of the back,

09:04.778 --> 09:06.146
and then that
caught fire.

09:06.179 --> 09:11.151
The worst was when we dropped
3,000 feet in 10 seconds.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.286
Herman was on the ceiling.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.755
Aah!

09:14.788 --> 09:16.189
Oh! Stop!

09:16.223 --> 09:18.091
This is not helping me.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.128
**

09:24.064 --> 09:26.033
Nice dog.
Mnh-mnh.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.135
Maxine is
an emotional support dog.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.202
As long
as she has a vest on,

09:29.236 --> 09:30.738
she's legally allowed
on the plane.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.172
It's cool.
I like dogs.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.907
Oh, you do?

09:33.941 --> 09:35.776
Well, she needs
to stretch her legs.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.044
You want to walk her
for me?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.912
I'll give you $5.

09:38.946 --> 09:39.980
Done.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.954
That's right.

09:46.987 --> 09:50.691
Drift off to la-la-land.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.992
Oh, it is "go" time.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.761
Hey, Dad.
Hey. What are you -- Shh!

09:53.794 --> 09:55.028
Vanessa's sleeping.
What are you doing?

09:55.062 --> 09:56.029
What's up?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.999
Well, I'm sitting next
to this really nice girl.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.734
I'm nervous.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.735
I might have lied to her.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.803
Okay, well, no, you can't
do that, Jack, okay?

10:02.836 --> 10:04.337
You got to go back there
and tell her the truth.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.739
That's the only way
it works.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.374
Dr. Gable.
Yes?

10:07.407 --> 10:09.409
Would you like the steak
or the chicken?

10:09.442 --> 10:10.811
Surprise me.

10:10.844 --> 10:11.645
Hey, buddy,
you can't be here.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.814
This is first class.
Get out of here.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.390
Hi.
I don't know if you heard
anything over there or not.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.058
I just wanted to --
Wait. Hey, I like your shirt.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.227
Oh. Tha--
Wait, are you
a Billy Joel fan?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.328
I am.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.830
You know, I was
at the concert

10:29.863 --> 10:31.364
where he closed
Shea Stadium.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.733
Are you kidding me?!
No.

10:32.766 --> 10:33.967
That's aw-- Wait.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.736
Please tell me
you're not a Mets fan, too.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.237
I mean, die-hard.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.706
Would you --
Would you ever, like,

10:38.739 --> 10:41.809
want to go to a game
or something?

10:41.842 --> 10:43.210
I'd love to.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.812
That --
That's incredible.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.379
So you were there?
You are -- I mean --

10:46.413 --> 10:48.281
Yeah.
That's awesome!

10:48.315 --> 10:50.017
And I was like...

10:55.355 --> 10:57.290
Yeah, is the foo--
The food ready?

10:57.324 --> 11:00.060
So sorry to wake you,
Mrs. Gable.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.763
There's just a situation
with your husband

11:02.796 --> 11:04.765
I think
you should be aware of.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.040
Uh...

11:13.073 --> 11:14.174
Listen, um...

11:16.109 --> 11:17.444
You're gonna hate me
in about a minute, but trust me,

11:17.477 --> 11:18.712
it's not
what it looks like, okay?

11:18.746 --> 11:19.713
What?
Wait, what?

11:19.747 --> 11:20.714
There's no time.
What is it?

11:20.748 --> 11:21.614
Just give me
your phone number.

11:21.648 --> 11:22.750
I-I'll call you sometime.
I'll call you.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.217
I don't know.
Hey. Hey!

11:24.251 --> 11:25.919
Hi, honey.

11:25.953 --> 11:26.920
Who is this?

11:26.954 --> 11:27.955
Uh, Lisa.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.356
Lisa.
Hello, nice to meet you.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.357
I'm his wife.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.291
What!

11:31.324 --> 11:32.826
Wife.
Wife!

11:35.062 --> 11:36.764
I can't believe this.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.032
We're going to Disney
on Saturday, too.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.100
Maybe we can meet up.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.268
That'd be great.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.170
I was thinking about hitting
the weight room a little bit,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.172
but I think I can take
one day off.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.173
Cool.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.008
My dad loves football.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.144
He's gonna want to hear
all about it.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.780
Yeah, about that.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.514
I got to tell you
something.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.316
I'm not really
the quarterback.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.286
I'm not even on the team.
Oh.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.955
Yeah, I just felt like
I should tell you the truth

12:01.989 --> 12:04.491
'cause lying
is never okay.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.060
Yeah, I appreciate you
being honest.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.728
That's great.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.270
What just happened?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.307
Look,
I know you're mad at me,

12:20.340 --> 12:22.475
but she wasn't right
for you, anyway.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.410
Okay.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.812
She loved Billy Joel.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.446
We all love him.
He's the Piano Man.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.250
I just don't understand
why I can't go back there,

12:30.283 --> 12:31.518
talk to her,
and make it right. That's all.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.921
Because the flight
isn't over yet.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.422
Okay.
That is why.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.358
Not going to tell you
again.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.793
Mm-kay.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.096
I hate you.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.098
I can read your lips.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.638
And friends of ours were on
that flight that crash-landed...

12:53.006 --> 12:54.207
Oh.
...in the Hudson River,

12:54.241 --> 12:55.308
you know, with Sully.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.543
Landed on the Hudson.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.979
That's why they call it
a water landing.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.047
It was a crash.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.414
-Oh!
-Birds flew in the engine.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.850
Caught fire. Crashed.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.851
Uh...

13:03.884 --> 13:05.118
Please stop talking.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.259
Sweetheart,
by the way, the...

13:12.292 --> 13:13.426
It's a little awkward
to say

13:13.460 --> 13:15.162
with someone sitting
in between us,

13:15.195 --> 13:17.898
but the new underpants
you got me

13:17.931 --> 13:19.399
are a little
constricting.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.968
Oh.
I'm sorry.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.369
I was trying out
a new brand.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.470
I appreciate that.

13:23.503 --> 13:27.574
It's just that the legs
are like, uh, two tourniquets.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.142
Okay. So, hold up.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.278
You went out and bought him
new underwear,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.580
and now he's complaining
about it?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.415
I wasn't complaining.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.517
Sounds like complaining
to me.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.620
If my wife bought me something,
I'd be grateful.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.890
But I'll shut up.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.524
No, you know what,
he's right.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.193
I mean, why don't you just
go buy your own

13:46.226 --> 13:48.028
instead of putting it
on my to

13:48.061 --> 13:49.863
And by the way,
after you turn 5,

13:49.897 --> 13:53.200
they're not called "underpants"
anymore.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.402
I think this goes deeper
than underpants.

13:57.370 --> 14:01.174
I didn't ask you to buy me
under...wear.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.275
No, no, no.
I get it.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.276
Bought the wrong
underwear,

14:03.310 --> 14:05.445
and I bought
the wrong sunscreen.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.380
It sounds like
you can't do anything right.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.184
You know,
I really resent that, Chale.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.452
I do my best.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.287
I didn't say
that you didn't.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.989
It was the man in the middle
that said it!

14:17.958 --> 14:19.927
Vanessa: No, really, I mean,
I've always loved planes.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.296
And I find air travel
to be magic.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.631
You know, like,
how does it, like, work?

14:28.601 --> 14:32.005
So...if, like,
the pilot dies,

14:32.039 --> 14:34.607
you're, like, "in charge"?

14:36.109 --> 14:38.145
That's sexy.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.080
You want to play my wife?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.315
Then you're my wife.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.285
Hon, uh, the kids were asking
for you back in our row.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.087
We have kids,
by the way.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.688
You want to play this game?
'Cause I'll play this game.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.357
Are you proud of yourself?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.125
Really. Seriously.
You feel like a big man now?

14:52.159 --> 14:53.493
What?
Eye for an eye.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.528
What are we doing?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.064
We're -- We're in first class
for an hour.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.465
We're already
at each other's throats.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.700
Look, I'm not the one who lied
to get us up here, okay?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.235
Okay, yes.
I lied.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.104
I said we're married
because I thought

15:04.137 --> 15:06.106
being in first class
would be a nice thing.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.207
So sorry.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.510
All right, let's just enjoy
the rest of the flight, okay?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.579
Okay.
I'll get the family
down to Florida,

15:12.612 --> 15:13.713
and everything
will be great.
Okay.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.648
We'll be in the sunshine,
and -- and, you know what,

15:15.682 --> 15:18.551
it'll practically
be perfect again.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.419
There you go.
Yeah.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.222
In the meantime,
let's enjoy first class.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.556
It's not so bad,
is it?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.425
Actually
I could get used to this.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.027
Right?
Yes!

15:29.362 --> 15:31.231
You two make me sick.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.136
So, it was all a lie?

15:36.169 --> 15:38.005
Uh, not all of it.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.406
Are you married?
No.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.640
Are you really
a neurosurgeon?

15:40.673 --> 15:43.376
Did you really have
to ask him that?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.278
We're --
We're really sorry, okay?

15:45.312 --> 15:47.480
Yes, it -- Uh, look,
it was my fault.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.183
His daughter and his son-in-law
are on the plane,

15:50.217 --> 15:51.684
and they're actually
the newlyweds.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.320
It was just
a misunderstanding at the gate

15:53.353 --> 15:54.587
I took advantage of.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.488
I'm really sorry.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.024
If you want to send her
back to coach,

15:57.057 --> 15:58.425
I mean,
I totally understand.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.426
Hey, I think actually,
at this point,

15:59.459 --> 16:02.029
you probably have to,
right?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.130
You're both going.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.731
Yep. Okay. Here we go.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.172
-Uh, leave 'em.
-Yeah.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.973
Yeah.
Okay. Let's go.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.548
**

16:21.581 --> 16:24.551
I feel like you two
are ganging up on me.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.253
Hey, don't drag me
into this.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.620
I just said,
"Stop being judgy."

16:27.654 --> 16:29.722
That's all I said.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.192
Yeah,
that's all he said, Chale.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.394
But in your defense,
she does sound like a handful.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.332
Kristie: Passengers
Kendra and Chale Witt,

16:39.366 --> 16:42.735
would you please
come up to first class?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.071
Ooh! Is that turkey?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.338
I'm gonna get me
one of those.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.340
Oh, she said
this was the last one.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.541
I'll give you $5.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.080
Okay, fine.
I'll give you $10.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.747
Thanks!

16:54.781 --> 16:57.650
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

16:57.684 --> 16:59.052
You know,
I got to say...

16:59.086 --> 17:00.220
Thank you.
...this is
more like it.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.089
I agree.

17:02.122 --> 17:05.358
Mm! Oh, and the best part --
no middle seat.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.526
Yeah.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.795
It is horrible back here.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.297
These seats are so small.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.698
Okay,
it is what it is.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.366
Just let it go, okay?

17:13.400 --> 17:14.467
I'm a first-class girl.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.502
I mean, I know that now.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.370
Well, toughen up.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.505
We got about an hour left,
all right,

17:18.538 --> 17:20.640
then it's Florida
with my family.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.742
And I am not letting
anything get in the way of that.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.545
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.779
Don't you do it.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.216
We just got contacted
by Jacksonville.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.151
Looks like there's
some bad weather up ahead.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.653
No.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.389
They're asking that we set her
down a little early.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.158
Looks like our final
destination today

17:38.191 --> 17:39.192
is gonna be...

17:39.226 --> 17:41.328
Florida.
The Panhandle of Florida.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.562
...Nickelsville, Louisiana.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.533
And the weather there is...

17:46.566 --> 17:48.601
Unseasonably warm.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.837
...37 and cloudy.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.672
Flight attendants,
prepare for landing.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.674
Buckle up. It's gonna be bumpy
on the approach.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.278
This is it!

17:58.311 --> 17:59.546
We're going down!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.582
Rootger,
you got to shut up!

18:02.615 --> 18:06.419
**

18:06.453 --> 18:08.655
Great. Weatherman says
the storm's gonna last

18:08.688 --> 18:10.190
for the next two days.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.424
That's perfect.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.660
I can save my money
by not going anywhere.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.564
What kind of hotel
doesn't have a bar?

18:19.632 --> 18:22.569
Can we please focus
on what we do have

18:22.602 --> 18:24.271
instead of what we don't?

18:24.304 --> 18:26.439
I mean,
it's not that bad.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.875
Let's go to Florida
tonight!

18:28.908 --> 18:31.611
Uh, I don't know. I think
the road conditions alone

18:31.644 --> 18:33.480
are highly questionable,
and then you factor in

18:33.513 --> 18:34.681
the high winds
and the rain.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.350
Come on. You're not factoring in
the driver behind the wheel

18:37.384 --> 18:39.319
that will get us
to the Sunshine State.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.454
It's a little breezy.
We'll have fun.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.556
We'll sing songs in the car
on the way down,

18:43.590 --> 18:44.524
and we'll be there
by morning.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.826
Now, I'm getting
in the rental car right now.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.562
I expect you guys
to follow me.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.165
I will be there,
and I will be ready, okay?

18:52.199 --> 18:53.466
Now, I'm not waiting
that long.

18:57.937 --> 19:01.474
He does have a sort
of...inspiring optimism.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.411
More like
a...blind stupidity.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.781
You know what?
Dad's right.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.483
Maybe we should just
grab our stuff,

19:10.517 --> 19:12.952
get in the car,
and just go.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.821
Yeah, it'll kind of be like
an adventure.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.189
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.225
I kind of feel bad
for the big guy.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.930
As long as the wheels are
on the floor, I'm good to go.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.537
Did you guys see something?

19:42.549 --> 19:43.650
Hi. Uh, we're -- we're traveling
back to New York in coach,

19:45.852 --> 19:48.821
and we just wanted you to be
aware of a special occasion.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.858
Um, we're celebrating
her new kidneys.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.693
Uh, one of which is mine.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.428
Yes.

19:55.462 --> 19:56.796
Yeah.
-Thanks again, honey.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.565
It's working
really well.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.434
You know, just seeing
if you could work the...

20:01.468 --> 20:02.969
You want to do a little bit
of the, uh, you know, the, uh...

20:03.002 --> 20:04.471
Like that?

20:09.309 --> 20:10.410
Okay.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.481
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:14.514 --> 20:17.717
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:17.750 --> 20:19.852
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:19.886 --> 20:21.488
* Do, do, do, do

20:21.521 --> 20:24.991
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:25.024 --> 20:28.027
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:28.060 --> 20:30.830
* I just don't want no...
