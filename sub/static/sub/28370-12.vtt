Oh, come on.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.372
You call me out of the blue
and then you show up at my bar.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.374
[scoffs]
Your bar...
Vanessa, if you,

22:55.417 --> 22:57.506
if you wanted to talk
to me or...

22:57.550 --> 22:59.116
or get back together
with me, whatever,

22:59.160 --> 23:01.292
you could've-- you could've
just told me, it's okay.

23:01.336 --> 23:02.903
Jess...

23:02.946 --> 23:05.427
I called you because I was

23:05.471 --> 23:07.255
removing your number
from my favorites,

23:07.298 --> 23:09.779
and I accidentally
clicked it.

23:11.607 --> 23:12.869
Oh.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.396
Well, but you're here, so...

23:17.439 --> 23:19.136
Yeah, I left my credit card

23:19.180 --> 23:20.616
the night that
you told me you cheated.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.010
So I came back to get it.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.881
I honestly figured
you wouldn't be here.

23:24.925 --> 23:27.406
It's the middle
of a workday, so...

23:27.449 --> 23:30.191
Oh.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.628
I'm-I'm sorry if you thought...

23:32.672 --> 23:37.241
No. Oh, God, I did not
think anything of it.

23:37.285 --> 23:40.070
For real. It's...

23:44.335 --> 23:46.816
It was great seeing you.
[chuckles]

23:50.254 --> 23:51.255
How'd it go?

23:51.299 --> 23:53.083
Ow!Thank you, Felix.

23:53.127 --> 23:54.476
What?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.435
What'd I do?

23:56.478 --> 23:58.262
Jess. What happened?

23:58.306 --> 24:00.830
You're an idiot.Me?

24:00.874 --> 24:02.876
[music playing]

24:07.271 --> 24:08.882
What do we got?

24:08.925 --> 24:10.144
A café.

24:10.187 --> 24:11.885
Kinda cute.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.756
Bunch of douchebags
on laptops?

24:13.800 --> 24:16.629
Pretty much.
Great.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.589
Hey, what can
I get you guys?

24:20.633 --> 24:23.200
I'm a detective
with the Chicago PD,

24:23.244 --> 24:25.333
and we're trying to trace
a laptop

24:25.376 --> 24:26.595
that used the Wi-Fi here.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.597
Do you keep a log of

24:28.641 --> 24:31.165
the IP addresses
that use your Wi-Fi?

24:31.208 --> 24:33.776
Uh... no.

24:33.820 --> 24:37.388
Okay, um, can I speak
with the manager?

24:37.432 --> 24:39.042
[chuckles]
That's-that's me.

24:39.086 --> 24:43.003
Did anyone, uh...
suspicious-looking

24:43.046 --> 24:46.136
or like, uh... you know,
like "murdery,"

24:46.180 --> 24:49.749
come in here on the...
on March 6?

24:49.792 --> 24:53.187
Like, seven months ago?
You're serious?

24:56.451 --> 24:57.800
Yeah.

24:57.844 --> 25:01.412
Is there anyone else
we can talk to?

25:01.456 --> 25:04.241
Like a supervisor or a-a
regular customer or something?

25:04.285 --> 25:06.722
Believe me, I am just
as desperate to find answers

25:06.766 --> 25:10.160
as you are, but I just don't
think there are any here.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.948
Now, you gonna tell me why
you were so jumpy before?

25:14.991 --> 25:17.864
What? I'm--
I wasn't jumpy.

25:17.907 --> 25:20.954
[sighs] Come on, now, I'm
a better detective than that.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.696
Murphy,

25:23.739 --> 25:25.741
you can trust me.

25:27.003 --> 25:29.353
I promise you.

25:29.397 --> 25:32.835
Okay, I... trust you.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.358
This cannot go beyond you.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.491
Okay.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.278
Nia came to see me earlier.

25:41.322 --> 25:44.368
What? What did she want?

25:44.412 --> 25:47.720
She just said
that she didn't have anything

25:47.763 --> 25:49.330
to do with Tyson, and,

25:49.373 --> 25:51.462
and I-I don't know.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.595
I don't know
anything anymore.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.423
I'll take you home.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.251
I can't just go home.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.295
I'm sorry, Murphy.

25:58.339 --> 26:01.734
Sometimes things are
just dead ends.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.917
Come on, Pretzel.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.227
Do you have a light?
No.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.447
But this place has matches.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.407
Here you go.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.409
Oh.

26:31.328 --> 26:34.288
Fancy.
Forward, Pretzel.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.350
[engine starts]

27:00.401 --> 27:02.403
[engine starts]

27:11.064 --> 27:13.022
Thanks for calling
me back, Rhonda.

27:13.066 --> 27:16.547
What's going on?

27:16.591 --> 27:18.245
Just...

27:19.638 --> 27:22.423
I can't move on until
I know what happened.

27:22.466 --> 27:25.556
And I'm starting to feel
like I might never know.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.124
[sighs]

27:28.168 --> 27:29.691
Maybe you already do know
what happened,

27:29.735 --> 27:32.128
and you just don't want
to accept it.

27:34.783 --> 27:36.742
Yeah.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.744
Darnell?

27:38.787 --> 27:41.137
I didn't want to
believe it either.

27:41.181 --> 27:45.751
But in a way, it's...
it's not that hard.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.018
Well, you know,
Detective Becker doesn't think

27:52.061 --> 27:53.584
that Darnell did it, either.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.325
She-- she's been
on the case for...

27:55.369 --> 27:56.326
Jules Becker?

27:56.370 --> 27:58.851
...for months.
Yeah.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.114
She's been covering for him
since they were teenagers

28:01.157 --> 28:05.596
and he was slinging
dime bags on the corner.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.816
What are you talking about?

28:07.860 --> 28:09.862
Jules and Darnell were
real close back in the day.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.385
I don't know if
they still speak,

28:11.428 --> 28:13.343
but she had a crush on that
boy like I ain't never seen.

28:13.387 --> 28:14.431
Wait, they know each other?

28:14.475 --> 28:17.696
Yeah. You didn't know that?

28:19.393 --> 28:21.569
She's lying to me.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.005
Why would she lie to me?

28:23.049 --> 28:25.878
Why would she--
why would she lie to-to me?

28:28.141 --> 28:30.534
Everybody has their reasons.

28:32.232 --> 28:34.060
I shouldn't have, um--

28:34.103 --> 28:35.365
I shouldn't have bothered you.
I'm sorry.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.237
Murphy, it's all right.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.719
I love that you loved my kid.

28:45.288 --> 28:48.030
But what you're doing
isn't gonna bring him back.

28:51.686 --> 28:52.905
Do me a favor

28:52.948 --> 28:55.081
for Tyson.

28:55.124 --> 28:57.170
Quit smoking.
It'll kill you.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.088
I will.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.742
Not today.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.004
Of course not.

29:05.047 --> 29:07.136
I will.

29:12.576 --> 29:15.144
[pats leg]

29:15.188 --> 29:16.929
Bye, Murph.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.802
Bye.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.908
All right, here.
Coming in.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.823
I'm right here.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.825
Got it?

29:48.308 --> 29:49.483
It's not the worst.

29:49.526 --> 29:52.442
Yes. High compliment
coming from you.

29:54.923 --> 29:56.359
[groans]So, um,

29:56.403 --> 30:00.189
how are things going
on the Tyson front?

30:00.233 --> 30:03.584
You know what, I'm actually
not here to talk about Tyson.

30:03.627 --> 30:05.934
Really?
Really.

30:05.978 --> 30:10.634
Darnell did it,
so... that's that.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.638
So it's really over.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.510
It's really over.

30:16.553 --> 30:19.121
Okay. Well...

30:19.165 --> 30:23.082
Murphy Mason, I have known
many detectives in my life,

30:23.125 --> 30:28.348
and, um, none of them,
not a single one, was as

30:28.391 --> 30:31.003
annoying as you.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.440
Annoyingly brilliant?

30:33.483 --> 30:34.789
[laughing]

30:34.833 --> 30:36.747
Annoyingly good at the job?Yeah.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.881
Despite not being qualified
or trained in any way?

30:39.925 --> 30:41.100
That's exactly what I meant.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.624
You got it. [chuckles]Thank you.

30:43.667 --> 30:48.368
So, then wh...
why are you here?

30:49.891 --> 30:51.937
I don't know.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.417
Just couldn't go back
to my empty, messy apartment.

30:54.461 --> 30:55.854
[laughs weakly]

30:55.897 --> 30:57.768
You and Jess...

30:57.812 --> 31:00.249
Same.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.338
I don't want to overstep,

31:02.382 --> 31:05.646
but, you know, you...
you could call her.

31:05.689 --> 31:07.953
It's fine.

31:10.303 --> 31:14.829
Well, do you...
want to stay for dinner?

31:17.179 --> 31:20.052
What?
I do.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.705
I do. I just, um--

31:21.749 --> 31:24.883
I don't-- I don't like
whatever the hell you made.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.885
Ooh. Ouch.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.538
I'm sorry.
What even is that?

31:28.582 --> 31:30.497
It's stew.

31:30.540 --> 31:33.456
Who eats stew? Like,
are we in the cave times?

31:33.500 --> 31:34.805
What is that?All right, fine,
shut up.

31:34.849 --> 31:39.071
Stew?Fine. Chloe hates it, too.

31:39.114 --> 31:43.945
Well, listen,
it's still your birthday.

31:43.989 --> 31:44.946
We can go wherever you want.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.948
No, it's fine, I--

31:46.992 --> 31:48.384
I just want this day
to be over.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.559
I hate my birthday.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.083
You can't hate your birthday.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.824
You've got to have one good
birthday that you can remember.

31:53.868 --> 31:55.522
Not really.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.654
Not one?

32:00.657 --> 32:02.833
Fine.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.618
One.

32:06.141 --> 32:09.014
MURPHY:
I can't believe
you actually brought me here.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.841
I'm sorry, wasn't it you
who told me

32:10.885 --> 32:12.626
I was supposed to treat
Chloe exactly the same

32:12.669 --> 32:13.670
as before she went blind?

32:13.714 --> 32:16.151
Yeah. Touché.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.239
Now what?

32:17.283 --> 32:19.154
Uh, I am gonna go get us
some skates.

32:19.198 --> 32:20.155

All right.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.570

Let's do it.

32:43.613 --> 32:44.963
Help me, please.

32:45.006 --> 32:47.400
I got you.
Right here, right here.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.532
I feel like-- I think
we should just maybe

32:49.576 --> 32:51.056
go get some cigarettes
and Slurpees instead.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.274
I feel like that'd be

32:52.318 --> 32:55.016
a really good time.No way. We're skating.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.279
I think someone else wants
the first skate, though.

32:57.323 --> 32:59.064

such a forward guy.

and Felix called your parents.

33:45.980 --> 33:48.243
Yes, he did.

your knees and use your core.
