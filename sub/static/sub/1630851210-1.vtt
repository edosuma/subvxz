WEBVTT

01:07.720 --> 01:08.960
Whoo!

02:18.720 --> 02:20.400
Whoo!

02:20.480 --> 02:22.520
That was so great!

02:23.360 --> 02:24.240
It was okay.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.640
I didn't come though.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.400
But you do usually come, though, right?

02:34.480 --> 02:37.000
Yeah. I mean, with other guys.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.840
But not with me?

02:40.600 --> 02:42.600
Well, this is quite a surprise.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.240
Who gave you these orgasms, then?

02:46.760 --> 02:50.120
Tom Baker, Joe Fuchart, Ryan Bailey--

02:50.200 --> 02:51.720
Okay, I get it. I get it.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.680
-What did they do different?
-I don't know. Maybe do some research.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.680
Am I bad at sex?

03:39.680 --> 03:41.520
-Hello?
-Good morning, darling!

03:41.600 --> 03:44.200
-Wanted to make sure you didn't sleep in.
-Mm-hmm.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.480
-You had breakfast yet?
-Mm-hmm.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.960
Can I please have more
than a one-grunt answer?

03:49.480 --> 03:51.040
Have you told Jakob yet?

03:51.120 --> 03:55.000
I'm about to be on-air, sweetheart,
so I'll… We'll talk about that later.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.480
We have Dr. Jean Milburn here
to talk about her new book,

04:02.560 --> 04:06.040
Uneducated Nation -
A Sex Education Manifesto for Our Youth.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.400
She wrote this as a response to
working on campus at Moordale Secondary,

04:09.480 --> 04:14.760
which got some pretty bad press recently
following a chlamydia outbreak,

04:14.840 --> 04:17.760
and the performance
of a so-called "sex musical."

04:18.920 --> 04:21.600
So, Dr. Milburn, tell us about the book.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.720
Well, I was shocked at the ineptitude
of the SRE curriculums in schools.

04:28.800 --> 04:34.960
So I created this easy-to-read manual
to help empower our teenagers,

04:35.040 --> 04:39.840
and their parents, as they become
sexually active young adults.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.000
Sounds a bit racy.

04:42.440 --> 04:45.880
Well, if, by racy,
you mean highly researched

04:45.960 --> 04:50.040
and completely essential to the health
and well-being of our children,

04:50.680 --> 04:53.360
then, yes, I suppose it is.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.120
A lot of people
will be sitting at home thinking,

04:56.200 --> 04:57.840
"I wasn't taught this stuff, and I…"

04:57.920 --> 04:58.760
Thanks.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.280
"Is it really necessary?"

05:00.360 --> 05:04.360
Hopefully, if people read my book,
they'll understand how…

05:04.440 --> 05:07.240
They're not still going on
about "Sex School," are they?

05:07.320 --> 05:10.360
Mm. It's as if no one
in this town's had sex before.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.000
Okay, thanks for the tea, Joe!

05:13.560 --> 05:14.520
I better go.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.480
I don't wanna be late for my first day.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.160
If you're not gonna finish your tea,
at least take your lunch.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.120
Oh.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.400
It's a fancy sandwich. Cheese and ham.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.840
-Wow.
-Mm.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.880
Hm. Thank you.
See you later. Have a nice day.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.240
-Bye.
-Good luck!

05:34.280 --> 05:38.600
Enough of the yearning looks, you pillock.
Just tell her you like her already.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.240
-Hi!
-Hi!

05:46.000 --> 05:47.400
Nice ride, Aimes.

05:47.480 --> 05:52.800
Thanks! Mum thinks I'm safer driving
than getting the bus, so here we are.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.920
Okay.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.640
-Who's this?

05:56.840 --> 05:58.040
Maeve, that's Steve.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.160
No, Aimee, the goat.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.160
Oh! She's our commitment animal.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.720
Apparently,
pets bring couples closer together.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.320
We didn't think about who was gonna
look after her when we're at school, so…

06:09.400 --> 06:11.440
-Yeah. Right!

06:17.920 --> 06:18.840
Sorry, love!

06:19.800 --> 06:21.560
-Aimes?
-You okay?

06:21.640 --> 06:22.960
-No!
-Yeah.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.560
Let's try that again, shall we?

06:38.760 --> 06:40.280
Oatcake, what's on your face?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.560
It's a mustache.
I've been growing it all summer,

06:43.640 --> 06:47.400
but somebody has been too busy having sex
with their new boyfriend to notice.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.600
Uh, I was hoping it was a phase.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.600
And Adam and I aren't having sex sex.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.400
We're just doing hand jobs and stuff.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.760
Hand jobs is sex.
Virginity is a construct.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.080
Yes! Yes, I know!

06:59.160 --> 07:02.240
But I really want to go all the way!

07:05.960 --> 07:07.680
What is it you want to say to me?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.640
I think you need to be careful.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.640
And I think you need
to make more of an effort with him.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.280
Okay. Okay, I will.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.320
Hey, I forgot to tell you.
I saw Maeve the other day.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.840
Why are you telling me about Maeve?

07:23.920 --> 07:27.320
-I thought you might wanna know?
-She hasn't responded to my message.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.200
She's made it abundantly clear
she doesn't want me in her life, so, no.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.000
I don't need to know
what Maeve is doing anymore.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.200
Well, I just--

07:35.280 --> 07:36.960
Oh my God!

07:37.040 --> 07:39.080
-The fuck is that?

07:39.680 --> 07:42.160
-Adam, you fucking idiot!
-Fuck!

07:42.240 --> 07:43.960
Whoo! Ha ha!

07:45.960 --> 07:47.080
All right, New Kid?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.760
What is that on your face?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.560
What's Adam Groff doing back?

08:03.640 --> 08:05.600
I heard his mum bribed the school
to let him back.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.400
And you know he's gay now, right?

08:09.040 --> 08:09.920
You okay?

08:10.520 --> 08:11.720
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.440
Oatcake, you all right?

08:21.520 --> 08:24.800
I'm A-okay, Eric. I'm fine. I'm chillaxed!

08:25.320 --> 08:27.000
To the max!

08:27.760 --> 08:29.840
Okay then, Mr. Mustache.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.200
So you guys didn't speak much over summer?

08:32.280 --> 08:35.800
No. I haven't heard from him
since last term.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.480
-I always thought you two would make up.
-We're not fighting.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.840
We're just not friends anymore.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.080
Why's there a camera crew here?

08:47.080 --> 08:48.120
You've grown!

08:48.200 --> 08:49.920
Massive!

08:50.000 --> 08:52.880
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, girls!
Why is there a goat on campus?

08:52.960 --> 08:54.880
She's mine and Steve's commitment animal.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.920
Right. You didn't think of a hamster?

08:57.800 --> 08:59.560
Or, um, a terrapin?

09:00.200 --> 09:01.440
Or a worm farm?

09:04.320 --> 09:05.520
How's Eugene?

09:05.600 --> 09:07.400
I mean, long-distance is hard,

09:07.480 --> 09:10.600
but I think if we play our cards right,
we'll both end up at Oxford.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.000
Did I tell you he speaks six languages?

09:13.080 --> 09:14.000
Yes.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.800
Here are some of the students
currently attending what has been dubbed

09:20.880 --> 09:22.280
the "Sex School."

09:22.840 --> 09:26.160
Oh, excuse me, young man,
what can you tell us

09:26.240 --> 09:29.200
about last year's chlamydia outbreak
on campus?

09:32.480 --> 09:33.440
Please speak.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.120
We're live.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.000
Uh, hi. Hi.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.240
I'm Eric Effiong.

09:44.320 --> 09:49.320
And all I can say about the outbreak was
that it was absolutely terrifying.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.120
We were scared for our lives.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.040
Do you have an opinion, young man?

09:55.800 --> 09:56.640
Yes.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.280
Firstly, it was mass hysteria,

09:58.360 --> 10:00.480
not a chlamydia outbreak.
Your facts are wrong.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.000
-Otis, shh! We're on TV.
-Yeah, shut up, Milburn!

10:03.080 --> 10:06.280
-Are you Dr. Jean Milburn's son?
-Yes. Yes, he is that.

10:06.360 --> 10:10.800
Are the students of Moordale as depraved
as your mother makes out in her new book?

10:10.880 --> 10:14.760
I think my mum's book is
an honest insight into teenagers today,

10:14.840 --> 10:18.040
and people should probably read it
before speculating.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.560
You should probably read it.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.120
Probably.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.200
It's true. I do love an empty school.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.600
-But it's nice to see the students.
-Priceless.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.520
I used to teach geography
before I became a headmaster.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.400
I'm also very experienced
in teaching history and--

10:37.480 --> 10:41.200
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Groff.
We will consider your application.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.800
Are you actually going to consider
my application?

10:45.720 --> 10:46.600
No.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.640
I'm sorry. The controversy surrounding
Moordale Secondary is too fresh.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.120
You're also far too experienced
for this role.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.880
This is the fifth teaching position
that I've applied for,

10:56.960 --> 11:00.120
and frankly, I'm running out of options.

11:01.640 --> 11:02.680
It's still a no.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.360
Good morning, Moordale!

11:45.440 --> 11:47.240
How is everyone feeling today?

11:47.320 --> 11:48.560
Really good!

11:49.200 --> 11:52.240
I am your new head teacher, Mrs. Haddon,

11:52.840 --> 11:54.200
but you can call me Hope.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.840
She's cool.
Teachers aren't supposed to be cool.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.040
The first thing you need to know about me

12:02.160 --> 12:04.480
is that I used to be sitting
where you are now.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.960
Literally.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.440
Yeah, I went to Moordale too.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.520
-I love her lipstick. It's so bold.
-Mm.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.320
I've achieved a lot since then.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.240
Two degrees, teaching positions
at some of the country's top institutions,

12:18.960 --> 12:23.040
and by 28, I became
the youngest head teacher in the UK.

12:24.280 --> 12:28.320
But the years I spent in this building
were the best of my life.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.080
This school not only encouraged me
to excel academically,

12:33.040 --> 12:36.000
but it truly allowed me
to find my purpose.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.080
Which is why it's been so hurtful
to read some of the horrible things

12:40.160 --> 12:42.280
written about Moordale in the press.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.840
I don't know what went wrong

12:45.920 --> 12:47.480
or how we ended up here,

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
but I do know

12:50.960 --> 12:52.680
it changes today.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.960
I can promise you this.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.840
If you work hard
and you take pride in your school,

13:03.480 --> 13:07.440
I will get Moordale and your futures

13:07.520 --> 13:08.360
back on track.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.160
-Yeah!
-Oh!

13:11.240 --> 13:13.320
-Wow!
-Come on, girl!

13:14.080 --> 13:15.280
So let me hear you.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.360
Let's get Moordale…

13:18.440 --> 13:19.960
Back on track!

13:20.040 --> 13:21.480
Let's get Moordale…

13:21.560 --> 13:23.000
-I love her.
-Back on track!

13:23.080 --> 13:24.880
She's like Joan of Arc, but cooler.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.960
-Back on track!
-Yes!

13:28.120 --> 13:29.800
-Wow!

13:30.520 --> 13:32.560
-Thank you all!
-Come on.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.200
To a great start and a great week. And oh!

13:36.240 --> 13:41.240
Can Otis Milburn
and Maeve Wiley come to my office, please?

13:41.840 --> 13:43.520
You get to meet her in the flesh.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.840
Maeve!

14:01.840 --> 14:02.880
Hi, Jakob!

14:04.120 --> 14:05.560
You're looking well.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.560
Oh, this?

14:10.120 --> 14:11.600
Funny story.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.320
You impregnated me.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.720
Surprise!

14:17.360 --> 14:18.200
Oh shit.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.960
Damn it! Shit, shit, shit!

14:39.400 --> 14:40.840
How come you're back in school?

14:41.480 --> 14:43.440
I wanna learn some shit, don't I?

14:45.160 --> 14:48.840
You must be Jackson Marchetti,
famed head boy.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.000
That would be me.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.680
Of course. Of course.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.240
Acting, swimming extraordinaire.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.280
I'm re-enrolling.
I think I need to take some kind of test.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.720
Ah, yes, Mr. Groff's son.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.640
My receptionist has your paperwork.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.240
Hi, guys. You can go straight in.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.840
Jackson,
can I get you to come back a bit later?

15:11.920 --> 15:13.680
It was really lovely to meet you.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.000
I've heard
a lot about the two of you.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.400
Sit down.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.320
Don't worry. You're not in any trouble.

15:28.400 --> 15:33.800
An on-campus sex clinic for teenagers is
rather entrepreneurial, in my opinion.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.440
Shows a lot of business savvy.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.920
Is it something you're wanting to pursue?

15:43.200 --> 15:44.160
N… no.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.600
No. We don't run the clinic anymore.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.320
We've realized
it wasn't very ethical, and we--

15:51.400 --> 15:54.240
We sort of stopped being friends.
We grew apart.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.880
Oh. That's a shame.

15:57.840 --> 16:02.480
Anyway, I just wanted to say that Moordale
is here to encourage your passions.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.200
It would be great
if you could keep me in the loop

16:05.280 --> 16:08.560
of any further business endeavors
you come up with in the future.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.280
That's it.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.320
Okay.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.720
Thank you.

16:18.840 --> 16:19.800
Oh, Otis…

16:21.520 --> 16:24.040
tell your mum I'm really looking forward
to reading her book.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.680
I will… Yeah. Yeah.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.720
-I thought we were screwed.
-Me too.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.360
-Shit. Well, thank God.
-Yeah.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.040
So why aren't we friends anymore?

16:45.200 --> 16:46.200
Nice beard.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.480
What's your point?

16:51.800 --> 16:52.800
Nothing.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.640
We're just in different places.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.000
If that's what you wanna call it.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.200
Bye, Otis.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.240
Maeve?

17:13.760 --> 17:14.640
Yeah?

17:21.600 --> 17:22.920
It's called a mustache.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
Yeah, no shit.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.320
-Wait. Did anyone see you coming in?
-No, I was careful.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.440
Okay.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.120
Careful there. Careful there.

18:17.720 --> 18:18.680
Okay.

18:20.240 --> 18:23.360
Oh, your aftershave is so cheap.
It turns me on.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.360
Hi, I'm looking for Sex King?

18:30.440 --> 18:32.480
What is the problem, young man?

18:32.560 --> 18:37.160
Um, my girlfriend told me
she's never come having sex with me,

18:37.240 --> 18:38.960
but she did used to with other guys.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.040
-What are your measurements?
-What do you mean?

18:42.560 --> 18:45.040
Women need a large penis
in order to come.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.160
A smaller penis could be okay
with the right amount of girth,

18:48.240 --> 18:51.600
but a small dick and no girth
will never please a woman.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.960
I've, uh, never measured.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.640
Come back to me when you do.

18:55.720 --> 18:59.640
I'll need measurements
for width, length, erect, and flaccid.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.160
That'll be 30 pounds, please.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.440
-But you haven't helped.
-Half now, half later?

19:27.560 --> 19:28.800
Kyle?

19:29.320 --> 19:31.400
Milburn! It's only you.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.880
Thought it was the fuzz again.
I'm the Sex King now!

19:34.840 --> 19:36.960
You are no such thing!

19:37.680 --> 19:39.800
-You left a gap in the market.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.920
-"Pubes are overrated"?
-Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.400
"To win the race, come on the face"?

19:45.480 --> 19:46.400
Big-time.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.240
Are you just getting
all your advice from porn?

19:50.120 --> 19:54.360
Look, no offense, mate,
but I've had a lot more sex than you.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.960
Well, I'm going to have to report you
because this is dangerous and it's wrong.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.760
Shoot!

20:05.360 --> 20:07.120
What are you doing in here, anyway?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.080
Nothing.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.920
Kyle.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.080
Ruby! What are you doing here?

20:25.160 --> 20:27.040
Well, well, well.

20:27.120 --> 20:31.280
Ruby Matthews
is secretly shagging Otis Milburn.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.080
-Kyle…
-People are gonna love this!

20:34.160 --> 20:36.800
Kyle, wait!
Please don't tell anyone about this.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.120
Then you can't tell anyone
about me being the Sex King.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.000
Unless you want everyone to know
about your secret sex affair.

20:44.560 --> 20:45.480
Laters, losers.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.680
Well done.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.840
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby, wait!

20:54.960 --> 20:57.680
I… I have to tell somebody.
He could hurt people!

20:58.320 --> 20:59.160
Otis,

21:00.120 --> 21:02.160
do you like having sex with me?

21:02.240 --> 21:03.080
Mm.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.720
Do you like it when I touch you?

21:07.440 --> 21:11.680
Would you like it if I were
to suddenly stop touching you forever?

21:12.760 --> 21:13.880
No.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.120
-Then you will keep your mouth shut.
-Mm.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.000
Remember,
five feet behind me at all times.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.800
Someone else is giving out sex advice
on campus.

21:45.880 --> 21:46.760
Who?

21:47.360 --> 21:48.400
I can't say.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.720
What do you mean, "You can't say"?
We tell each other everything!

21:51.800 --> 21:53.800
You know it stays between me and you.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.440
Okay. Okay, fine.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.160
-It's Kyle.
-Hmm?

21:59.240 --> 22:02.360
He's charging people for advice
and calling himself the Sex King.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.760
Look at my big tits!

22:03.840 --> 22:06.960
-I mean, we have to tell someone.
-We can't.

22:07.040 --> 22:07.920
Why not?

22:08.440 --> 22:09.440
Because

22:10.440 --> 22:13.280
if I do, he's gonna tell people
I'm hooking up with Ruby.

22:15.320 --> 22:16.640
Sorry, what?

22:17.160 --> 22:18.520
Look, I haven't told you,

22:18.600 --> 22:21.920
but we've been having casual sex
all over summer.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.920
She wants it to be a secret,
and we haven't seen each other that much.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.120
Are you kidding?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.560
Hey, what's that on your neck?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.960
Oh my God!

22:41.760 --> 22:44.360
What? How? When?

22:44.440 --> 22:45.560
Okay, okay, okay.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.560
So, it was Olivia's party.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.600
You were supposed to come
but decided to watch movies with Adam.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.200
Anyway, I was there on my own.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.560
At first, Ruby ignored me.

22:55.720 --> 22:56.680
But then…

23:05.800 --> 23:07.480
-Milburn!
-Oh!

23:08.640 --> 23:10.720
Oh. Hi, Ruby, what are you?

23:11.480 --> 23:13.680
I'm early 2000s Christina Aguilera.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.440
Very cool. I'm macaroni cheese.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.200
-Shut up and have sex with me.
-What are you sad about tonight?

23:18.280 --> 23:20.440
I'm a teenage girl, Otis. I'm always sad.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.280
Wait. Why were you macaroni cheese?

23:26.360 --> 23:28.360
That's not the point, Eric!

23:28.440 --> 23:30.320
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.520
I think I'm still figuring it out myself.

23:32.600 --> 23:36.680
You're having casual sex
with the most popular girl in school?

23:36.760 --> 23:37.600
I know!

23:37.680 --> 23:39.640
-I'm so proud of you!
-It's amazing.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.960
-I'm so proud of you!
-And there's no strings.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.600
-So nobody gets hurt.
-Mm.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.200
Wahey! Whoa!

23:46.280 --> 23:48.000
What you gonna do about Kyle?

23:49.520 --> 23:51.640
I guess
it's not my responsibility anymore?

23:51.720 --> 23:52.680
Ow! Oh!

24:02.120 --> 24:04.040
Groff loves penis!

24:04.120 --> 24:05.320
How did the test go?

24:07.160 --> 24:08.320
It does look bad.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.720
You got a problem?

24:11.800 --> 24:14.080
No, Adam. Sorry, Adam.

24:20.640 --> 24:21.640
What are you doing?

24:21.720 --> 24:23.480
They… they were talking about me.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.880
But that doesn't mean
you can hurt people, Adam.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.120
No, I… I can't do this again.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.600
What are you all looking at?

25:04.480 --> 25:05.960
Hey, hey, little bro!

25:06.520 --> 25:09.800
How was the, uh, job interview?

25:09.880 --> 25:11.120
Did you smash it?

25:11.200 --> 25:14.000
Yeah, yes, it was great.
Um, I start tomorrow.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.480
Thank fuck!

25:16.360 --> 25:17.960
Hey, tell me something.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.840
What's an average teacher's salary
these days?

25:20.920 --> 25:24.080
You know, ballpark. We were talking
at work, and we haven't got a clue.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.440
-Well, it starts--
-Mm.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.000
Taste that. Go on, it's a protein shake.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.280
-How fucking good is that?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.520
-Come on! Eh?

25:39.120 --> 25:43.480
Oh shit. You remember James McBride?
He's only gone and bought a yacht.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.480
Now the wife's dropping fucking hints.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.280
Know what the secret
to a happy marriage is?

25:48.360 --> 25:50.840
I'm not really the best person
to answer that, Peter.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.360
Money. Well, that and keeping
the toilet seat down, but

25:56.000 --> 25:57.280
mostly fucking money…

25:59.240 --> 26:03.120
I'm so wired after court today!
I fucking destroyed the defendant.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.240
I mean, I just like…
…dismembered them.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.160
Come on. Quick game of squash, Chub-Chub?

26:10.240 --> 26:12.000
Oink, oink.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.400
Nice day at school?

26:20.480 --> 26:23.880
Yeah, it was all right.
Your book is causing quite the stir.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.520
-Press there and everything.
-Really?

26:26.600 --> 26:28.760
-It's not that controversial.
-I know.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.120
Mm. Wanna watch a movie tonight?

26:31.200 --> 26:33.600
How about When Harry Met Sally…?

26:34.200 --> 26:35.520
-Or…

26:36.200 --> 26:38.160
…How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days?

26:39.360 --> 26:40.560
You choose.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.080
I'm going out.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.240
Where?

26:47.400 --> 26:48.920
I have homework with Eric.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.280
-I'll be home later.
-Right.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.320
Oh, Otis.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.560
I've got a scan tomorrow.
Will you come with me?

26:57.200 --> 26:58.520
Please?

26:59.560 --> 27:00.440
Sure.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.000
But you have to tell him, Mum.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.000
I will.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.680
Go away, Mum.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.840
You're not wanking, are you?

27:22.920 --> 27:24.120
Are you okay?

27:25.400 --> 27:27.240
Do you wanna go and smash some shit?

27:27.800 --> 27:30.240
Or we could talk instead?

27:33.520 --> 27:35.520
I'm… I'm not good at talking.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.240
When my mum died,
I was angry all the time.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.480
My counselor told me
to take my anger out on a pillow,

27:43.560 --> 27:46.440
so I punched my pillow
every night for months.

27:47.080 --> 27:51.400
But in the end, it turned out that
talking was the only thing that helped.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.560
What happened today?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.240
I… I don't want people
to think I'm a pussy.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.040
-'Cause you're dating a guy?
-I'm still a man.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.880
Yeah. Of course you're still a man.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.800
But you know,
men don't need to hit things,

28:09.880 --> 28:12.640
and men can date other men.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.680
-You need to tell Eric how you feel.
-I don't…

28:17.800 --> 28:18.720
I don't know how.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.120
Well, I think you should try.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.280
Ya pussy!

28:27.360 --> 28:31.480
Can we do the punching pillow thing first?

28:32.080 --> 28:34.480
Absolutely. Bring it here.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.400
So what you have do is
just take a deep breath in.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.920
-Mm-hmm.
-Get yourself all pumped up.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.480
Ah!

28:56.120 --> 28:58.360
-Get it.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.240
That's a good effort, Michaela!

29:05.960 --> 29:09.400
Quick shower, then, uh, Quorn Bolognese.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.800
Fucking love Quorn!

29:19.400 --> 29:20.360
Oh God.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.240
I said, don't wear your jacket!
People might recognize you!

29:44.320 --> 29:48.400
It's cold, and we're in the woods.
I'm sure it will be fine.

29:52.600 --> 29:53.840
And the jeans…

29:55.160 --> 29:56.240
Mmm.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.600
Thank you.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.200
Yes.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.680
-Hello!

30:02.880 --> 30:04.560
-Let me get my leg.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.880
-Shh.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.600
-Okay.

30:12.760 --> 30:13.960
Oh! Ow!

30:14.040 --> 30:15.320
Ow, ow, ow!

30:15.400 --> 30:17.400
-Stop.
-Careful of my hair.

30:17.480 --> 30:21.400
Okay, this isn't working.
Can't we go to your house? Or mine?

30:21.480 --> 30:23.400
Houses are off-limits. It's too risky.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.440
I get that you want us to be a secret,

30:27.160 --> 30:30.080
but it feels like you're embarrassed
to even be seen near me.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.800
I'm a very private person, Otis.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.440
I think you're embarrassed.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.320
Okay, fine. I'm embarrassed!

30:38.400 --> 30:40.120
I am hot and popular,

30:40.200 --> 30:43.760
and you are a badly-dressed stick man
with a creepy mustache.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.680
You said you liked my mustache.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.360
And I was good at sex.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.120
You are good at sex, Otis,

30:49.200 --> 30:52.000
but that doesn't mean
I want to be seen in public with you.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.320
Well, I don't wanna be seen in public
with someone who is mean

30:58.400 --> 31:01.960
and uses people for their good sex skills!

31:02.040 --> 31:03.800
I have more self-respect than that.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.400
We're done.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.400
And we're not done. We're over!

31:23.480 --> 31:25.720
"Over" and "done" mean the same thing!

32:07.920 --> 32:09.080
I know, baby.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.760
Hi, this is Erin. Leave a message.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.400
Hi, Mum, it's Maeve.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.400
Listen, I know you're not speaking to me,
but I really think we should talk.

32:22.000 --> 32:22.960
Call me back?

32:24.600 --> 32:25.440
I miss you.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.000
Hey, Maeve.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.880
Can I talk to you about something?

32:31.960 --> 32:32.800
Yeah.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.400
What's wrong?

32:35.080 --> 32:36.560
Mum still isn't answering me.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.520
She hates me.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.400
You did the right thing,
and don't forget that.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.880
What do you wanna talk about?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.280
I wanted to talk about the…

32:50.920 --> 32:51.760
Um…

32:52.720 --> 32:54.520
I wanted to talk about…

32:57.400 --> 32:58.480
breakfast.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.960
-Raspberry or strawberry jam?

33:01.760 --> 33:02.680
Uh, raspberry.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.920
Well, good news, we've got neither.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.560
Mm. Very good, very good.
I'll be out in a second.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.680
Thanks so much
for coming in again, Jackson.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.640
I basically
just wanted to get to know you a bit,

33:16.720 --> 33:19.200
seeing as we'll be working
closely together.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.920
You know, I was once head girl here.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.120
I get the responsibility.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.680
Yeah, it's fun.

33:24.760 --> 33:27.080
And challenging, I hope.

33:28.040 --> 33:28.920
Hm.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
The thing is, I'm really wanting to inject
some proper passion back into this place.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.040
To create an environment
where everyone can excel,

33:37.120 --> 33:39.160
no matter what path
they choose to go down.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.840
Hope, the press are here
for your interview.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.320
Thank you. I'll be right there.

33:46.120 --> 33:50.040
I wanted to share with you
the new school values.

33:50.120 --> 33:53.640
I'm excited to hear your feedback
when you get a chance.

33:57.080 --> 33:58.000
Hi!

33:58.600 --> 33:59.920
Oh, and, Jackson,

34:00.440 --> 34:04.080
I'm going to need you to take this role
a bit more seriously than you have been.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.800
I'm not really into
the whole "cool guy" thing

34:08.720 --> 34:09.920
if you know what I mean.

34:10.880 --> 34:11.760
Not really.

34:11.840 --> 34:12.960
You will.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.120
She's nuts.

34:18.720 --> 34:22.200
-Cal, it's PE. Are you coming?
-Yeah, I'll be right there.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.960
-Whoa!
-Hey.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.360
-Oh. Oops.
-Whoa!

34:25.440 --> 34:28.360
I'm… Okay, I'm in your way, obviously.

34:28.960 --> 34:29.840
It's okay.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.120
After you, good human.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.880
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:53.880 --> 34:56.600
I don't like it when I hurt people.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.520
-Then don't.
-Yeah.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.280
I don't know why I do it. I just get so

35:03.120 --> 35:04.240
angry, but…

35:06.320 --> 35:07.200
I wanna change.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.440
Okay.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.080
You're a poofter now, Groff?

35:35.640 --> 35:38.480
Yeah, I am a bit of a poofter now.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.400
Is that all right with you?

35:41.920 --> 35:43.760
Yeah, mate. I think it's cool.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.960
Yeah, congrats, dude.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.240
You don't need to congratulate someone
on being gay.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.720
Okay. Width, length, flaccid, erect.

37:11.760 --> 37:15.560
Shit. It's not very big, is it?
Come on. Let's get you hard.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.040
Yeah!

37:18.120 --> 37:19.320
Come on!

37:19.960 --> 37:21.680
For the love of God! Come on!

37:22.760 --> 37:23.800
Come on!

37:41.440 --> 37:44.760
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-And you.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.080
We were thinking, I don't know…

37:47.800 --> 37:48.640
Shit!

38:01.600 --> 38:02.760
Strange.

38:04.080 --> 38:07.200
I guess
it's lost property for you.

38:12.960 --> 38:13.840
Fuck.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.760
Dude, why are you naked?

38:19.840 --> 38:21.040
Don't look at my dick!

38:32.200 --> 38:35.600
Hey, Otis. Is it true that you
and Ruby are a thing now?

38:35.680 --> 38:39.000
No. No. Why did you say that?

38:39.080 --> 38:40.360
Everyone's talking about it.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.560
Sex King.

38:56.200 --> 39:01.840
So in the structure,
the double bond causes a kink in the tail.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.080
Uh-huh.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.200
So… Aimee Gibbs!

39:04.280 --> 39:06.480
Sir, I need to take Goat out for a wee.

39:06.560 --> 39:07.760
Right, fine. Go on.

39:08.560 --> 39:13.000
See, this is exactly why you shouldn't be
bringing livestock into school.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.360
-My mum's looking after her tomorrow.
-Good.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.120
Okay, this is the only goat
you should be seeing in school.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.560
Uh, it's a goatee.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.040
It's my new look. Hands up who likes it.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.440
Oh God. Oh God.

39:37.360 --> 39:38.760
Do a wee for Mummy.

39:41.560 --> 39:42.760
-What the f--

39:42.840 --> 39:44.240
Fatty acids!

39:45.040 --> 39:47.600
-Okay…
-Sir, Dex Thompson's naked!

39:52.960 --> 39:54.800
Oh my God! It's tiny!

39:55.400 --> 39:57.840
Look away!
I don't want you to see my dick!

39:57.920 --> 39:59.840
-Fuck!

39:59.920 --> 40:02.840
Penis!

40:02.920 --> 40:05.160
What is happening? Tell me now!

40:05.240 --> 40:07.040
Why are you naked?

40:07.640 --> 40:08.480
Dex?

40:09.000 --> 40:11.360
-I need to borrow this.
-No, not my goat. Not my goat.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.120
-I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
-Don't take her!

40:14.200 --> 40:15.520
-I'll bring it back.
-Please!

40:15.600 --> 40:17.360
-I'm sorry.
-Please!

40:17.440 --> 40:20.080
Goat!

40:20.160 --> 40:22.960
I would say I'm here to try
and bring back a sense of community

40:23.040 --> 40:24.480
and family values that--

40:24.560 --> 40:25.600
Is that a dog?

40:26.600 --> 40:29.520
It's a fucking goat.
Film it, for Christ's sake!

40:30.120 --> 40:33.880
What were you saying about family values,
Headmistress?

40:33.960 --> 40:36.680
Would you just excuse me
just one moment? Thank you.

40:46.600 --> 40:47.440
No.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.320
No, no, no!

40:49.840 --> 40:51.120
No, no, no, no!

40:58.840 --> 41:00.560
I think I just lost all my work.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.760
Yeah, the computers are terrible.
Maybe get a laptop.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.880
-Hey. Hey, have you seen Kyle?
-No.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.560
I should never have listened
to the fucking Sex King!

41:26.240 --> 41:27.680
Dex, are you okay?

41:28.200 --> 41:31.040
I should never have listened
to the Sex King.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.080
Who's the Sex King?

41:35.680 --> 41:36.560
Kyle.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.560
Okay, okay, okay.

41:46.840 --> 41:47.920
-Hey!

41:48.520 --> 41:49.960
Are you stalking me, woman?

41:50.560 --> 41:53.080
No! No, don't be ridiculous.

41:53.640 --> 41:58.360
I just happened to be driving by
this place where you work.

41:58.440 --> 42:00.360
You've driven past 15 times!

42:00.440 --> 42:02.640
I can see you out the window.

42:03.240 --> 42:04.200
What's going on?

42:08.320 --> 42:09.640
Can we talk?

42:11.440 --> 42:13.840
-If you stop being scary.

42:15.040 --> 42:15.880
Yes.

42:18.840 --> 42:20.680
-Are you stepping out?
-Mm-hmm.

42:20.760 --> 42:21.680
Good.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.800
So, Dex,

42:42.520 --> 42:44.080
how did we get here?

42:45.600 --> 42:47.480
I was measuring my penis.

42:47.560 --> 42:51.080
Mm. I told him to do that.
So what're your stats, then?

42:51.160 --> 42:52.240
I was interrupted.

42:53.680 --> 42:54.840
And I don't wanna know.

42:54.920 --> 42:58.240
What if I do have a small penis,
and I can never please a woman?

42:59.800 --> 43:02.600
Maybe you can look at it for me
and tell me if it's small.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.680
-Yeah! Sure.
-No! No! No!

43:04.760 --> 43:06.920
No! No, nobody's inspecting anything

43:07.520 --> 43:09.600
because penis size isn't important.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.280
Only guys with small dicks say that.

43:15.280 --> 43:19.120
Dex, you shouldn't compare
the size of your dick to anyone else's.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.640
It's irrelevant and unhelpful.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.960
You'd also be surprised

43:24.040 --> 43:26.720
how many guys have insecurities
about the size of their penis

43:26.800 --> 43:30.440
and exaggerated views
as to what other male genitals look like.

43:31.240 --> 43:34.080
It's true. I wish mine was straighter.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.720
It sort of bends to the side a bit.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.440
It's… it's wonky, you know?

43:42.400 --> 43:43.520
It's not wonky.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.200
It's unique.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.960
Thanks, Milburn.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.920
That means a lot.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.920
Well, that's very touching.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.440
Dex, why did you say
you'll never please a woman?

43:56.520 --> 43:59.360
He can't make
his girlfriend come during sex.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.000
What kind of sex?

44:02.880 --> 44:05.480
You know, just normal fucking.

44:06.840 --> 44:12.040
Okay. Well, most women struggle
to orgasm from penetration alone.

44:12.120 --> 44:14.240
-Really?
-Yeah.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.600
You heard of the clitoris?

44:19.160 --> 44:20.400
Sure.

44:20.480 --> 44:24.160
Might be time to get acquainted with it.
Ask your girlfriend what she likes.

44:24.240 --> 44:27.720
And remember that orgasm
doesn't have to be the main goal of sex.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.440
You can have fun

44:30.400 --> 44:32.200
and be creative.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.120
Could you clarify?

44:34.720 --> 44:36.680
You have ten fingers and a tongue, Dex.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.480
Use your imagination.

44:39.400 --> 44:40.560
Wow.

44:40.640 --> 44:44.160
You guys are actually really good
at giving out sex advice.

44:48.080 --> 44:51.200
Maybe keep this on the down-low?
Could be bad for my business.

44:51.280 --> 44:54.600
Hey. I'm going to lost property,
but thanks for the help.

44:55.400 --> 44:58.120
Oh! And, hey, Otis,
I heard about you and Ruby.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.840
Don't know how
you pulled that off, but congrats.

45:06.200 --> 45:10.240
-You and Ruby are a thing.
-Well, we're not anymore.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.240
We were for a bit,
but it was casual, you know?

45:13.320 --> 45:14.360
No feelings.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.680
No feelings. Sounds cool.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Thanks for telling everyone, Kyle.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.640
Well, I didn't tell anyone.

45:25.160 --> 45:27.600
But now everyone knows
about you and Ruby,

45:27.680 --> 45:29.520
guess I can carry on being the Sex King.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.360
Au revoir, loser!

45:32.760 --> 45:35.480
It means
exactly the opposite of that, Kyle!

45:37.960 --> 45:40.640
I didn't know
whether I was going to keep it.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.200
I was confused, and

45:44.360 --> 45:45.880
I kept putting it off.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.320
Then I started writing my book.

45:49.400 --> 45:53.960
And I enjoyed every second of that,
and I got immersed.

45:55.440 --> 46:00.200
-How could you keep this from me?
-I wanted to tell you, I did.

46:00.280 --> 46:01.440
I-- But the…

46:02.200 --> 46:05.440
the longer I waited, the harder it got.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.480
I'm having a baby?

46:14.440 --> 46:17.440
I don't want you to feel
backed into a corner.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.000
I have decided to keep this baby,

46:21.080 --> 46:24.800
and I feel empowered by that choice, and…

46:27.120 --> 46:32.280
I only need you to be involved if you feel
it's something that you would like.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.680
Do you want me to be involved?

46:39.760 --> 46:41.600
Of course I do.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.200
But only if you want to be involved.

46:52.160 --> 46:53.240
I have a scan

46:54.240 --> 46:56.320
tonight at30.

46:57.120 --> 46:59.240
-At Moordale Community Hospital. You--
-Thank you.

47:04.440 --> 47:06.640
I really have to think about this.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.880
-Of course.
-Yeah.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.120
I would say I'm here

47:15.200 --> 47:17.680
to bring back
a sense of community and family values.

47:19.400 --> 47:21.720
-What were you saying about family values?
-Come in.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.840
Would you just excuse me
just one moment? Thank you.

47:26.640 --> 47:29.400
The clinic is still running
in the old toilet block.

47:29.920 --> 47:32.040
Maeve and I have nothing to do with it,

47:32.120 --> 47:35.240
but it's still happening,
and it's dangerous.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.440
Students shouldn't be getting advice
from students,

47:39.320 --> 47:40.480
but they still need help,

47:40.560 --> 47:43.920
so hopefully, you can provide
the right service on campus.

47:45.360 --> 47:47.000
Thank you for telling me, Otis.

47:51.360 --> 47:55.120
Miss Sands, I did type up my essay,
but the school computer broke.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.400
-Can I get an extension?
-Okay. Don't let it happen again.

47:58.480 --> 48:02.160
Oh, uh, Maeve,
have a look at applying for that.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.440
You're the perfect candidate.

48:04.520 --> 48:07.960
Adam, I marked your test this afternoon.
Here's your timetable.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.520
Ah! What set are you in?

48:10.720 --> 48:11.640
Take a guess.

48:11.720 --> 48:15.600
Eric. Eric!
Everybody knows about me and Ruby.

48:15.680 --> 48:16.800
Did you tell anyone?

48:17.400 --> 48:19.600
I accidentally told Adam.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.120
And I told Ola.

48:21.920 --> 48:24.000
-I told Lily.
-And I told everyone.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.720
This was supposed to stay
between me and you!

48:32.160 --> 48:33.440
What are you doing here?

48:33.520 --> 48:38.000
I sold my first painting,
so no beans on toast for us tonight.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.880
We are going out for pizza!

48:39.960 --> 48:43.080
Oh, well done.
Always knew you would, genius.

48:52.560 --> 48:55.760
Apparently, you're secretly sleeping
with Otis Milburn.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.040
Ugh! As if.

48:58.560 --> 48:59.560
It's true.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.320
No, it's really not.
It's really not.

49:27.320 --> 49:28.240
Mum?

49:28.880 --> 49:30.800
Hi, how are you?

49:31.360 --> 49:32.960
Stop calling me.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.320
-We have a friendly relationship.
-Yeah, but not that friendly.

49:48.760 --> 49:51.520
I didn't come,
but that was so much better!

50:08.680 --> 50:11.000
So now everyone knows anyway,

50:11.840 --> 50:14.320
I was thinking
we could keep seeing each other?

50:15.600 --> 50:18.120
You know,
because I like having sex with you.

50:19.960 --> 50:21.880
No more cars or toilets?

50:23.120 --> 50:25.720
No, no more cars or toilets.

50:54.400 --> 50:57.480
-Thanks for the tip, Otis.
-Did you tell her to do this?

50:59.080 --> 51:00.080
It needed to end.

51:04.240 --> 51:05.560
So it's really done, then.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.720
Yeah, it really is.
