WEBVTT

00:16.140 --> 00:17.684
Poppy, there you are. Good. Listen.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.979
Where else would I be? I'm stuck here.

00:21.522 --> 00:26.527
I worked with you for too long, and now
I'm too crazy to work anywhere else.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.403
This isn't a job.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.739
It's a prison.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.535
These are prison bars.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.787
Yeah.
I didn't get what you were going for.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.541
I feel like if you just add
a little bit more shading in here

00:40.624 --> 00:42.167
then that would probably do it.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.794
-Sure.
-Great.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.170
What do you want, Ian?

00:45.254 --> 00:48.924
Listen, Pop, I know that these past
few days have been a little bit...

00:50.050 --> 00:51.301
weird. But...

00:51.385 --> 00:55.430
I just wanna let you know that
I've been thinking about it and I...

00:55.931 --> 00:58.976
I have two words that
I think are going to change everything.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.897
Blood Ocean.

01:06.650 --> 01:07.651
What is that?

01:07.734 --> 01:09.236
I don't know. But it's cool, right?

01:09.319 --> 01:10.529
I just came up with it, so...

01:10.612 --> 01:12.489
Why are you so happy?

01:12.573 --> 01:15.617
Didn't you just have
a massively unsuccessful reunion

01:15.701 --> 01:17.411
with your estranged son?

01:17.494 --> 01:20.956
And now you come bouncing in here
wanting to talk about a new feature.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.042
Is it a feature? I mean,
maybe it's a weapon! Or a new biome.

01:24.126 --> 01:27.880
Maybe it's a way for you to deflect
from having to deal with your emotions.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.132
No. No, I'm not deflecting, all right?

01:30.215 --> 01:34.136
I am focusing on the one thing
that actually matters. The game.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.681
Great. Well, when you figure out
what Blood Ocean is,

01:37.764 --> 01:39.641
come in here and tell me,
and I'll code it,

01:39.725 --> 01:42.519
because I have no control over my work
or my life.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.188
I'm just trapped here.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.817
Great! Yes. I love this new attitude,
Poppy. I'm very excited.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.652
I'm just gonna noodle.
I'll get back to you.

01:50.736 --> 01:55.157
Oh, Pop.
I just... just had one small idea.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.910
If you just separated these bars
a little bit more,

01:57.993 --> 02:00.537
I think people would actually know
what you're going for.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.208
Great. Okay. Cool.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.231
Work harder! Just kidding.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.858
Hey, guys. Fellas and Michelle.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.194
Can I get everyone's attention? Listen.

02:32.277 --> 02:37.074
It's no secret that we have had
an incredible year here at Mythic Quest,

02:37.157 --> 02:41.036
and management wanted
to give you guys something special

02:41.119 --> 02:43.455
to let you know how much
we appreciate all your hard work.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.748
We're getting bonuses?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.667
Well, no. No. But you are getting this.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.751
Jo?

02:53.799 --> 02:56.176
Ding-a-ling-a-ling! Ice-cream man!

02:58.512 --> 03:00.472
Guys, I got you an ice-cream machine!

03:00.556 --> 03:03.809
And you can eat
as much soft serve as you want.

03:03.892 --> 03:07.104
And none of that Froyo crap. I mean,
this is the real deal. This is dairy.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.899
Okay. That's it.

03:10.983 --> 03:13.861
David's shitty ice-cream machine
has forced our hand.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.363
Representatives from each department

03:16.446 --> 03:19.741
have been meeting in secret
for the past six months,

03:19.825 --> 03:23.537
and we are exercising our right
to enter into collective bargaining.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.914
I'm sorry?
I don't think I follow what you're saying.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.374
They're unionizing.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.377
We're unionizing. Bitch.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.300
Oh, my God!

03:36.383 --> 03:38.468
Mea culpa.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.637
Hey there, Danimals.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.306
I know I've betrayed your trust.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.267
But I love Mythic Quest,
more than anything,

03:45.350 --> 03:48.312
and I never meant to hurt it
or the people that I work with.

03:48.604 --> 03:51.690
And I'm no corporate shill.
I'm one of you, I promise.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.027
I wanna hear you out
and answer your questions.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.532
Okay. These aren't questions.
These are comments.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.284
And general insults.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.120
Oh, my God. Haven't heard that one.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.747
Or that.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.458
Please don't. You guys are better than--

04:09.541 --> 04:11.543
Oh, my God!

04:12.794 --> 04:14.463
Did someone just post my phone number?

04:15.881 --> 04:18.091
That's not my real number,
so don't even bother.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.847
Okay. You know what? I'm signing off.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.474
Wyld D.

04:25.557 --> 04:28.852
And cut. That was great.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.606
That was brutal. Why am I still
doing this? I am getting crushed.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.316
Yeah, but your numbers
are actually growing.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.193
It's all about the hate-watch now, right?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.612
It's about the hate-like, the hate-follow,
the hate-hate.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.905
People miss public executions.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.699
In my day, when critics savaged my books,

04:42.783 --> 04:45.786
and they did so
often and with great enthusiasm,

04:45.869 --> 04:48.455
I could simply
throw the newspaper in the trash.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.500
I wasn't picked apart at--

04:51.583 --> 04:53.335
Christ's wounds! What are they doing?

04:54.586 --> 04:57.464
Murdering me.
They do it every time I respawn.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.762
You're fucked.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.514
No!

05:08.725 --> 05:10.811
What is the staff complaining about?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.354
The game has never been more awesome.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.148
They're complaining about the hours
it takes to make it that awesome.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.317
The extended crunches for Raven's Banquet,

05:17.401 --> 05:19.278
the shovel rebuild,
the Dinner Party patches,

05:19.361 --> 05:21.238
the building of the coliseum
for the Masked Man fight.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.157
It takes as long as it takes
to make the game great.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.076
-According to you.
-I'm the creative director, Poppy.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.286
That's my job. I get to--

05:27.369 --> 05:30.497
Hey!
David's running this meeting. So shut it.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.000
Thank you, Jo.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.878
Now, look. We are staring down
the barrel of a mutiny here, okay?

05:35.961 --> 05:37.337
So we need to talk strategy.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.047
I want to open up the budget
and look at that.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.340
Ian, I wanna look at that with you.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.384
-He doesn't do budgets.
-I don't do budgets, David.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.053
You don't do-- You don't do budgets.
You don't do phones.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.638
-What do you do, Ian?
-Blood Ocean.

05:46.722 --> 05:49.057
-Blood Ocean.
-"Blood Ocean"? What is that?

05:49.141 --> 05:50.851
Is that like a... ocean of blood?

05:50.934 --> 05:53.312
-He doesn't know.
-I don't really know, but it could be.

05:53.395 --> 05:56.064
-Let's get a team on it.
-Right now? It's 2:00 in the morning.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.150
-He doesn't do time.
-It's 2:00 in the morning?

05:58.233 --> 05:59.902
What are these people
still doing here?

05:59.985 --> 06:03.113
You forced them to be here
in case you have a brilliant idea

06:03.197 --> 06:05.824
or just... mash two words together.

06:05.908 --> 06:09.161
Look, we cannot afford
to maintain an office like this.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.954
See, this is why it is your fault, Ian.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.248
David, it's your job to wrangle me.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.210
And if you can't do that,
then technically this is your fault.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.754
What, I'm like a wrangler at a rodeo?

06:18.837 --> 06:20.839
You know?
Wrangling you like some wild bull?

06:20.923 --> 06:23.091
Jo, write that down.
David called me a "wild bull."

06:23.175 --> 06:24.218
-I already got it.
-Great.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.385
No, don't put that down.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.054
I got a solution.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.889
-It's for Blood Ocean.
-It's a potion.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.433
The Blood Ocean potion.

06:31.517 --> 06:32.851
Ian's close to a breakthrough.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.186
No, Jo, don't encourage him.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.896
What happened? We were doing so well.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.690
I'm drawn to power,
and I'm sensing a shift.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.192
There is a shift. I feel it too.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.944
There's no shift. See, what happened--

06:42.027 --> 06:44.071
You've been standing the whole time,
even though I called the meeting--

06:44.154 --> 06:46.156
I'm gonna stand, and then, let me restart.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.242
-David. I'd prefer it if you sit.
-No.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.494
What's wrong, Pop? You look tired.

06:50.577 --> 06:54.498
I'm physically, emotionally
and spiritually exhausted.

06:54.957 --> 06:58.168
That's not good. Pop,
why don't you just go home, rest a bit?

06:58.252 --> 06:59.253
'Cause I need you sharp.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.421
Come back in like eight to ten hours.
That cool?

07:01.505 --> 07:03.882
-Whatever you say, Ian.
-Great.

07:05.676 --> 07:08.262
Good luck, Pop. Thank you.
Thank you for everything today.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.680
-Thank you.
-Awesome.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.598
-Is she okay?
-Yeah, she's fine. She's fine.

07:11.682 --> 07:12.599
She-- You know what?

07:12.683 --> 07:15.477
She's just really stressed out
about getting Blood Ocean perfect.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.906
-Hey, Rache.
-Hey. I was watching. Are you okay?

07:27.990 --> 07:31.159
I quit the stream.
The backlash was never gonna end.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.328
Shit, dude. I'm so sorry.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.123
But hey, you know, at least
you get to come back to testing, right?

07:36.206 --> 07:39.001
I thought so, but I just talked to Carol,

07:39.084 --> 07:40.961
and I guess
there's no job to come back to.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.629
What? No, no, no.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.673
You can-- We can just move Lou.

07:44.756 --> 07:45.924
He's not gonna leave.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.593
And I don't blame him.

07:47.676 --> 07:51.221
-So wait. You're leaving Mythic Quest?
-I guess so.

07:51.305 --> 07:55.434
No. No, no. You can't be leaving.
This is happening too fast.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.894
I'm sorry, Rache. I gotta go.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.313
A security guard? Is this necessary?

07:59.396 --> 08:02.774
It's company policy or something.
I think it's to make it less dramatic.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.068
Less dramatic? Wait. Wait!

08:05.152 --> 08:08.238
Getting perp-walked through the office
like a criminal is less dramatic?

08:08.322 --> 08:09.781
How is this less dramatic?

08:09.865 --> 08:12.326
Somebody help. Do something.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.702
This isn't supposed to be this way.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.078
Stop, stop, stop. Dana.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.496
Dana, don't go. Don't go.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.709
They got a better shitter down on two.
I'm gonna blow that thing up.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.294
Dana, I'm gonna fix this!

08:25.047 --> 08:27.758
Carol, you need to fire Lou
and give Dana her job back,

08:27.841 --> 08:29.843
because he has said vile things to me.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.720
Oh, my God. Did he sexually harass you?

08:31.803 --> 08:36.475
Well... no. He turned me down
when I was coming on to him.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.433
I wasn't coming on to him,
but he thought I was.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.770
Then he was super rude about it, but--

08:39.852 --> 08:42.731
I didn't wanna have sex with him,
but he thought that I did...

08:44.107 --> 08:45.692
But I don't. Does that count?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.862
No. In fact, that's refreshing.

08:48.946 --> 08:52.658
If you can't shitcan Lou, then can you
at least give Dana a new position?

08:52.741 --> 08:55.577
Creating a new position requires
budget redistribution

08:55.661 --> 08:59.915
and many, many things that have nothing
to do with the office of Human Resources.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.667
God damn it, Carol,
what do you even do here?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.710
I'm so glad you asked, okay?

09:03.794 --> 09:06.672
Because I have been trying to get
everyone to read these pamphlets I made

09:06.755 --> 09:09.758
-that very clearly explain that I--
-My God!

09:15.138 --> 09:17.850
Michelle, first off, I wanna thank you
for coming to the table,

09:17.933 --> 09:21.895
and let you know that management
is committed to smoothing things over

09:21.979 --> 09:23.689
and making sure that--

09:25.190 --> 09:29.069
I'm sorry. I'm just tired from working.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.239
-It's a tactic. Yawn back.
-Jo, no. We don't need tactics.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.659
Okay, look, Michelle.
We're on the same side, okay?

09:35.742 --> 09:38.036
So just tell me your demands.
Jo, make sure to get these down.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.621
We want overtime pay.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.373
The workers are grist for the mill!

09:41.456 --> 09:42.583
Jo, please!

09:43.917 --> 09:46.795
I'm sorry. My assistant
has very anti-union sentiment.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.006
It does not reflect our own beliefs.
Please, go ahead.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.382
That's it.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.176
That's it?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.430
Okay. Well, great.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.849
I thought you were gonna ask
for stuff like profit sharing, so...

09:58.932 --> 10:00.309
Can we get profit sharing?

10:05.564 --> 10:08.192
You're not very good at this.
Maybe you should get Ian to help.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.277
Look, I don't need him, okay?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.196
Let me ask you something.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.782
Why do the employees love Ian so much?

10:15.866 --> 10:17.826
You realize he's the one
that's causing you overtime.

10:17.910 --> 10:21.788
Yeah, but he's right. That's what it takes
to make the game great.

10:21.872 --> 10:25.000
We don't wanna work less,
we just wanna get paid for what we do.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.752
You get what you get
and you don't get upset!

10:26.835 --> 10:27.836
Jo.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.298
Michelle, what you're asking for
is totally reasonable.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.177
And so,
I am going to back the employees on this,

10:35.260 --> 10:37.179
because you guys deserve it. Here we go.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.388
What are you doing?

10:38.472 --> 10:41.975
I'm calling corporate, and I'm gonna tell
them if they want their biggest game,

10:42.059 --> 10:44.478
they're gonna have to increase the budget,
so I can pay you guys overtime,

10:44.561 --> 10:45.521
'cause you deserve it.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.064
They won't listen to you.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.692
Corporate and I exchanged some words
after the Masked Man fight,

10:50.776 --> 10:54.029
and if I'm being honest,
now I think they're a little afraid of me.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.572
He told them to French-kiss his dick.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.576
Yeah.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.289
Bonjour. Jacques and Jean-Luc's office.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.042
Yeah. It's Brittlesbee.
Get the guys on the phone for me.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.126
Please hold.

11:09.545 --> 11:10.838
You know what?

11:10.921 --> 11:14.967
You ladies might wanna take off.
I might use some choice language.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.054
Get going.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.229
Hello, David.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.524
Jacques and Jean-Luc. Let's talk.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.656
Gather round, peasants!

11:38.073 --> 11:42.786
Your superior, who earned his post
through merit and hard work,

11:42.870 --> 11:46.331
has seen it fit
to reward your disobedience with mercy.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.125
Right now,
he's on the phone with corporate,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.210
telling them to cave to your demands.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.214
Wow, this might actually work.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.883
Yeah, of course it's gonna work.

12:06.643 --> 12:07.644
I got fired.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.855
-What?
-I got fired.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.816
They don't see this as a union issue.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.319
They see it as a mismanagement issue.

12:16.195 --> 12:19.865
And they said that
the source of the problem is me,

12:19.948 --> 12:22.492
and so that I could pack my shit and go.

12:22.576 --> 12:23.785
What about our overtime?

12:23.869 --> 12:26.914
I don't know, Michelle. I didn't ask
about your fucking overtime, okay?

12:26.997 --> 12:28.957
To a company
that doesn't employ me anymore.

12:29.041 --> 12:32.211
I was too busy getting my ass chewed out
by a couple of French Canadians.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.588
You have your whole lives ahead of you.

12:34.671 --> 12:38.884
Some of us are 43-year-old white guys
who have to find another job.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.346
And that used to be easy, by the way,
it is not really easy right now, okay?

12:43.180 --> 12:44.473
Which is good, which is good.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.058
I know. It's good, it's good.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.560
But, you know,
it's not good if you're Dave Brittlesbee.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.439
For those of you who believe in me
as executive producer,

12:52.523 --> 12:53.774
I wanna ask you right now,

12:53.857 --> 12:57.486
would you feel comfortable walking out
and striking with me to save my job?

12:59.321 --> 13:01.198
Anyone raise their hand if you could.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.368
No? Nobody? Guys?

13:07.037 --> 13:08.664
Nobody. Unbelievable.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.208
So much for being a collective, huh?

13:11.834 --> 13:13.877
God. I'm so screwed. I gotta call my wife.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.879
-Ex-wife.
-Shut up, Jo!

13:17.381 --> 13:18.674
Where's Ian?

13:32.646 --> 13:33.689
Yeah.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.403
Hey, man. You all right?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.571
-Huh?
-You all right?

13:41.280 --> 13:42.447
Oh, yeah. It's...

13:43.407 --> 13:46.869
I'm doing a Blood Ocean thing.
It's for a video game.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.540
Shit,
you can't go in there with an open wound.

13:51.623 --> 13:52.916
Yeah, you're gonna get sick.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.793
I don't do sick.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.503
What does he mean he doesn't do sick?

13:56.587 --> 13:58.297
What the fuck? What a dick.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.890
Poppy. Poppy, let me in.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.266
Poppy! Poppy, let me in.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.226
Poppy, Poppy, Poppy.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.146
Hey. We gotta talk.

14:15.314 --> 14:16.398
-Blood Ocean.
-Nope.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.608
-I figured it out.
-No.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.109
-All right, Pop.
-No!

14:19.193 --> 14:21.361
-Get out of my house!
-Goddamn, you are actually strong.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.405
...discuss it. You're gonna like it.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.949
There's no escape. I can't escape.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.743
What happened to your finger?

14:27.826 --> 14:29.286
Oh, it got infected.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.414
Apparently you're not supposed
to go into the ocean with an open wound,

14:32.497 --> 14:35.334
on account of the microbes
from all the human feces, or some shit.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.960
Anyway, that's what they told me
at the hospital.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.837
You were in the hospital?

14:38.921 --> 14:41.089
Yes, but that's actually a good thing,

14:41.173 --> 14:44.551
because while I was there
with this very serious infection,

14:44.635 --> 14:47.179
I started to feel dizzy, you know?

14:47.262 --> 14:49.473
And, like,
that's kind of when I'm at my best

14:49.556 --> 14:52.684
because that's when the muse just,
sort of, starts sending me something.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.770
And all of a sudden I hear it.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.147
I hear it as a whisper.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.858
May have been the voice of God.
I don't know.

14:59.942 --> 15:03.362
She says... She says,

15:03.862 --> 15:07.241
"Blood Ocean is a disease."

15:09.701 --> 15:10.744
Ian...

15:12.788 --> 15:14.665
that is actually pretty good.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.458
Yes! Yes, yes! Okay.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.253
-Let's get you to a workstation, 'cause--
-No. I can't. I can't.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.464
I can't do it anymore. I give up.

15:22.548 --> 15:26.927
Look, Pop, I know that I can be difficult
to deal with, but so can you.

15:27.678 --> 15:30.138
But we're like The Beatles, you know?

15:30.222 --> 15:32.933
Big egos clash, and we fight all the time,

15:33.016 --> 15:37.396
but you can't deny that together
we make masterpieces.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.569
I'm sorry, The Beatles
are a rock band from the 1960s who--

15:43.652 --> 15:45.195
I know who The Beatles are.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.447
You didn't know
what Weird Science was.

15:47.531 --> 15:50.826
The Beatles and Weird Science
are not the same thing.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.870
The point is
that the struggle is worth it.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.998
Look. Come on.
Let me show you something.

16:00.961 --> 16:04.965
Right now there are 11 million people
playing Mythic Quest.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.802
Eleven million people could be
doing anything with their lives,

16:08.886 --> 16:10.637
and they're choosing us.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.515
Poppy, you can't give up.

16:13.599 --> 16:16.852
The world is better
with The Beatles in it, and you know it.

16:21.273 --> 16:22.524
The Beatles, huh?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.401
Yeah, The Beatles.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.406
Sure, I could write the lyrics
and the music and everything,

16:29.865 --> 16:33.702
but it would sound completely different
without the drums.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.207
Wait, I'm Ringo?

16:38.290 --> 16:39.458
Well, yeah. Of course you're Ringo.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.918
Somebody's gotta keep the beat.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.087
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:44.171 --> 16:46.298
You couldn't even give me
one of the good Beatles!

16:46.381 --> 16:48.342
Okay. It's not The Beatles.
It's something else--

16:48.425 --> 16:51.220
No, it is. It's whatever you say it is.
It's The Beatles.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.722
I am a paintbrush.
You're the creative director,

16:53.805 --> 16:55.974
so we're all just held hostage
to your every whim.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.769
That's why it's always
gonna be your world.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.812
Did you know that David got fired?

17:00.896 --> 17:02.940
Your staff are revolting.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.692
Mythic Quest is crumbling around you,

17:05.776 --> 17:08.569
and you're just letting someone else
take care of it.

17:08.654 --> 17:13.281
You are so self-absorbed that
you can't see you're fucking this game up,

17:13.367 --> 17:15.367
just like you fucked up your kid!

17:20.374 --> 17:21.208
No.

17:23.627 --> 17:24.461
You're right.

17:25.671 --> 17:26.755
No, I didn't mean that.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.299
It's okay, Poppy. You're right.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.593
-No. I didn't--
-I'm sorry.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.595
I-- I got confused.

17:33.679 --> 17:36.265
There were too many metaphors!

17:48.151 --> 17:49.403
-Brad, I need your help.
-"Brad, I need your help."

17:49.486 --> 17:50.988
Stop that. Look.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.992
Dana got let go. Like, from the company.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.536
Okay. So?

17:57.619 --> 18:00.664
So? Can't you manipulate the situation,
somehow?

18:00.747 --> 18:03.625
You know, Carol said something
about maybe creating a new position,

18:03.709 --> 18:05.294
-and I thought that--
-Wait. Creating a new position.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.421
-What are you even talking about?
-I don't know, man.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.549
I'm just-- I'm trying to do something
for somebody I care about.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.092
Don't you care about anything?

18:12.634 --> 18:14.386
Actually, I do. Thank you for asking.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.724
What do I care about?

18:21.852 --> 18:24.605
Are you familiar with... DuckTales?

18:26.815 --> 18:27.816
What?

18:29.151 --> 18:33.405
DuckTales. It's a cartoon from my youth
that had a profound impact on me.

18:33.488 --> 18:38.827
Scrooge McDuck, the wealthy,
swashbuckling patriarch of his family,

18:38.911 --> 18:39.912
owned a money bin.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.705
It's this silo-like structure

18:41.788 --> 18:44.041
that was so full of gold coins
and other currency

18:44.124 --> 18:47.002
he could swim in it as easily
as a poor duck could swim in water.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.297
It's my dream to build my own money bin,

18:50.380 --> 18:53.634
so I too can bathe in my hoarded wealth.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.846
What the fuck are you talking about?

18:57.930 --> 18:59.014
That's what my architect said to me,

18:59.097 --> 19:01.058
but then I wrote him a check
and he got right to work.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.060
You see, Rachel,
that's the thing about money.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.770
Its value is meaningless,

19:04.853 --> 19:07.523
unless it brings you happiness
in the form of things you love.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.816
Like becoming a cartoon duck?

19:09.900 --> 19:11.026
Owning people.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.695
Owning them in the way
that makes them do ridiculous things

19:13.779 --> 19:16.615
like build you a money bin or
a skyscraper with your name on top of it.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.993
My pursuit of money
is only the pursuit of ownership.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.413
Not in things, though. In people.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.707
This is bullshit, Brad, okay?

19:25.791 --> 19:27.960
This is your fault. You need to fix this!

19:28.043 --> 19:32.089
My fault? I gave her a dream job,
which she accepted and you encouraged.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.715
It's not my fault that she...

19:36.218 --> 19:39.221
Wait a minute. You don't know, do you?

19:39.304 --> 19:40.430
Know what?

19:43.600 --> 19:47.145
Apparently some web sleuths
found a reflection in her glasses.

19:47.563 --> 19:50.315
The glasses
I believe you told her to wear.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.944
Whoops. The Nebula Award.

19:54.820 --> 19:59.741
And from there it was just a hop, skip
and a coordinated online campaign away

19:59.825 --> 20:02.619
from connecting The Nebula Award to C.W.,

20:02.703 --> 20:04.496
C.W. to Ian, Ian to MQ,

20:04.580 --> 20:06.498
MQ to Dana, Dana back to MQ,

20:06.582 --> 20:08.709
and then of course,
Dana to corporate shill.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.923
I was just trying to help.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.425
I...

21:04.139 --> 21:06.016
Call Montreal.

21:06.767 --> 21:07.768
Calling Mom.

21:07.851 --> 21:09.603
No, don't call Mom.

21:10.521 --> 21:12.022
Call Montreal.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.358
Calling Monica.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.778
Fucking Mo-- Oh, fuck. Forget it.

21:44.805 --> 21:47.057
Come on. And look, we got toppings here.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.433
Yeah, there's all kinds of toppings.

21:48.517 --> 21:49.852
Get whatever you want. Yeah.

21:49.935 --> 21:52.980
Hey, Poppy! Ding-a-ling-a-ling.
You want some ice cream?

21:53.063 --> 21:54.356
What is going on?

21:54.439 --> 21:56.900
Ian called Montreal,
and he got me my job back.

21:56.984 --> 21:59.278
Yeah, and he got all the workers
their overtime pay.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.405
Yeah, he did it. He fixed everything.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.407
Of course he did.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.784
He's the best! Ding-a-ling-a-ling!

22:42.738 --> 22:46.116
It's transmitted through contact
with a certain elven species.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.745
The pain! The pain!

22:49.828 --> 22:51.079
My God.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.252
Blood Ocean.

23:04.635 --> 23:05.969
It's beautiful, Pop.

23:06.678 --> 23:09.556
It better be.
I stayed up all night building it.

23:10.641 --> 23:11.642
Why?

23:17.606 --> 23:21.193
Because... someone has to call the shots,

23:22.236 --> 23:23.237
and get all the glory,

23:23.987 --> 23:25.531
and someone has to keep the beat.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.616
Yeah.

23:29.243 --> 23:31.119
I know that because
I already said it to you last night.

23:31.203 --> 23:32.412
I know. I'm repeating it back to you,

23:32.496 --> 23:34.665
'cause I know you love
the sound of your own voice. I'm say--

23:34.748 --> 23:36.708
I will be Ringo, you fucking dick.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.920
That's great. Great news, Pop.

23:40.462 --> 23:43.048
-I do have one small tweak.
-Sorry, you have a tweak?

23:43.131 --> 23:44.299
-Yeah.
-You have a tweak.

23:44.383 --> 23:47.928
So, I've... I've only spent seven years
coming up with this personal epiphany,

23:48.011 --> 23:49.763
but... you have a tweak!

23:49.847 --> 23:51.306
-Great! You have a tweak!
-Yeah.

23:51.390 --> 23:55.227
Hey, great news, everyone!
Ian's got a tweak!

23:55.310 --> 23:57.563
Poppy,
will you be my co-creative director?

24:01.984 --> 24:02.985
What?

24:04.444 --> 24:05.946
Will you be...

24:07.489 --> 24:09.283
my co-creative director?

24:09.366 --> 24:10.534
How would that work?

24:11.285 --> 24:14.121
You can't have two creative directors.
Who's gonna call the shots?

24:14.204 --> 24:17.708
We both will. Equal say. Equal partners.

24:19.501 --> 24:20.961
I don't believe you.

24:22.296 --> 24:24.506
It's just talk. It's all just talk.

24:24.590 --> 24:27.885
It's gonna be exactly the same
as it's always been. I know that it will.

24:29.386 --> 24:30.637
Can I show you something?

24:32.723 --> 24:34.016
Come here. Check this out.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.479
I found this when we first moved in.

24:40.814 --> 24:44.401
The people that were here before us signed
it when they were building their game,

24:44.484 --> 24:46.820
but he fucked it all up
'cause he didn't listen to his partner.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.285
I don't wanna do that anymore.

24:54.995 --> 24:56.163
So...

25:02.544 --> 25:03.795
You want me to stab you?

25:03.879 --> 25:05.255
What? No!

25:05.339 --> 25:07.090
I want you to carve your name
into the column.

25:07.799 --> 25:09.801
-You don't get the metaphor that I'm--
-I don't know!

25:09.885 --> 25:13.305
Will you be my... Dr. Bean?

25:17.100 --> 25:19.061
I gotta be honest.
I still don't know what that means.

25:19.144 --> 25:20.771
Doc and Bean! It says Doc and Be--

25:20.854 --> 25:22.064
How are you not getting the metaphor?

25:22.147 --> 25:25.150
Carve your name in and then we're
carved in stone and then that's a...

25:25.234 --> 25:27.736
Right. Right. I get it now.

25:30.739 --> 25:31.907
Move.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.168
Give me the knife.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.260
Hey.

25:51.343 --> 25:54.763
Why so glum? It's a day of celebration.

25:54.847 --> 25:57.349
I don't really feel like celebrating
being at this job today, Lou.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.102
No, no, no. Not this. Me.
I got a promotion.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.687
-Wait, what?
-I know.

26:01.770 --> 26:04.439
Some moneybag upstairs shoved
a bunch of cash into the budget,

26:04.523 --> 26:05.649
created a whole new job.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.443
Director of quality consistency
or some shit.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.279
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

26:10.362 --> 26:14.366
And I know that power's an aphrodisiac,
so don't try to again with me.

26:14.449 --> 26:15.868
Okay? It's getting sad.

26:21.832 --> 26:22.875
Thank you.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.210
I own you.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.546
Did he just say, "I love you"?

26:28.839 --> 26:31.175
No. He said, "I own you."

26:32.593 --> 26:33.594
What?

26:40.851 --> 26:44.855
Today marks a new chapter
in the history of Mythic Quest.

26:46.190 --> 26:47.191
A new beginning.

26:47.733 --> 26:54.072
So with that, I would like you to welcome
your new co-creative director, Poppy Li.

26:56.283 --> 26:57.284
You're on, kid.

28:03.392 --> 28:05.185
-Hello?
-It's not working!

28:05.269 --> 28:07.729
Poppy is a monster,
and I refuse to work with her!

28:07.813 --> 28:09.022
Ian? Wait, what's going on?

28:09.106 --> 28:10.691
This was a massive, massive mistake.

28:10.774 --> 28:13.569
Listen, she's gonna call you. She's
gonna call you, and you cannot answer it.

28:13.652 --> 28:14.778
She's calling me, man.

28:14.862 --> 28:15.904
David, David, David, David.

28:15.988 --> 28:17.948
Do not answer the phone.
I absolutely forbid you to--

28:18.031 --> 28:20.868
I fucking hate him, David,
and I will not work with him!

28:20.951 --> 28:23.704
Oh, my God. Please just let me sleep.

28:23.787 --> 28:26.874
No. No, you can't sleep, David.
You gotta get down here and fix this!

28:26.957 --> 28:31.587
No. No. Listen. You guys gotta get
in the same room and hash it out.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.422
Oh, we're in the same room.

28:34.173 --> 28:36.550
-Hey, David.
-Get over here and fix this!

28:36.633 --> 28:38.468
No. I can't drive, okay?

28:38.552 --> 28:42.014
I took a Xanax and drank a bottle of wine,
just so I could sleep.

28:42.097 --> 28:44.892
Fine. Then Jo will just come pick you up.
Jo, go get him.

28:44.975 --> 28:47.436
Hey, David. I'm heading out to you now.
Put your shoes on.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.771
No, Jo. Jo, do not come to my house.

28:49.855 --> 28:51.690
-Stop telling me what I don't understand.
-Guys.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.567
-There are so many things that you don't--
-Guys.

28:57.237 --> 29:00.657
Okay. I'll be right there.
