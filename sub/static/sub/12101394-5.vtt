in G minor]

00:53.846 --> 00:56.223
-Can you smell my vagina?

00:56.307 --> 00:57.975
Not... Uh...

00:58.058 --> 00:59.685
No.

00:59.769 --> 01:02.146
I'm not saying you look like
a pervert or anything.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.148
I've got nothing against
perverts.

01:04.231 --> 01:07.067
My Uncle Trevor
was a pervert.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.195
Sorry, I made this weird.

01:09.278 --> 01:12.406
I didn't mean to
make it weird.

01:12.490 --> 01:14.825
The thing is...

01:14.909 --> 01:17.453
I sort of
haven't been home yet.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.664
Now, this is wild,
so wait for it.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.792
Yesterday afternoon,

01:22.875 --> 01:26.086
I went to the birthday party
of a two-year-old.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.672
[chuckles]
My friend's little girl.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.382
I mean, well... I mean,
our husbands work together,

01:30.466 --> 01:31.967
I've only met her twice,

01:32.051 --> 01:35.930
but it was a costume party,
obviously, hence...

01:36.013 --> 01:37.640
Et voila.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.809
I'm, like, an angel,
basically.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.560
You know,
like from the Bible.

01:41.644 --> 01:45.439
I was checking that
I didn't smell sort of thing.

01:45.523 --> 01:48.359
'Cause like I said,
I haven't been home.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.277
I actually think
I might still be drunk.

01:50.361 --> 01:52.822
I'm Jenny, by the way.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.074
I am great fun at parties.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.077
Reliable. I'm usually
the first person to arrive,

01:58.160 --> 01:59.995
and the last person to leave.

02:00.079 --> 02:02.998
That being said,
even I know that sometimes

02:03.082 --> 02:06.043
you just gotta go home and
wash off your congealed mascara

02:06.126 --> 02:08.212
and change your dirty panties.
Am I right?

02:09.839 --> 02:11.298
Uh...

02:14.718 --> 02:16.637
I hate waiting.
Don't you?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.763
So fucking boring.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.642
[sighs]

02:24.937 --> 02:28.357
Me and my husband
are trying for a baby.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.235
I think my womb is fucked.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.029
I find it kinda funny when
people say that, you know?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.116
"Trying" for a baby.
Basically just means

02:37.199 --> 02:39.118
he's ejaculating
inside me constantly,

02:39.201 --> 02:41.704
but, you know,
in a romantic, organized way.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.831
And I don't really
mind him doing it.

02:43.914 --> 02:48.085
It's just nice to feel wanted
by your husband, you know?

02:48.168 --> 02:51.297
Even if it is mainly to be
used as an incubator to grow

02:51.380 --> 02:52.965
a miniature version of him
inside me

02:53.048 --> 02:55.092
to feed his faltering ego.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.469
Oh, he's an AI counselor.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.014
We've been together
seven and a half years.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.765
We met at a sushi bar.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.226
He did have a brief dalliance
with Flavia from accounts,

03:04.310 --> 03:05.895
but that was more my fault
because

03:05.978 --> 03:08.856
I made him feel insecure about
his receding hairline.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.941
And I think he'll be
a great father.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.402
You know?
He's really wide.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.405
And, uh, you know, we always
talked about having kids.

03:16.488 --> 03:19.950
I just... I hope that they
inherit my bone structure

03:20.034 --> 03:22.703
because Lazlo is
built like a potato.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.788
Lazlo's my husband,
by the way.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.749
Lopsided penis.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.919
And I know that
it sounds like a cliché,

03:30.002 --> 03:34.256
but I just know that
I was born to be a mother.

03:34.340 --> 03:38.010
I'm patient and I'm... Ah.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.887
Kind. You know?

03:39.970 --> 03:42.806
I've got so many Tupperwares.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.600
And whenever I hold
another person's baby,

03:44.683 --> 03:45.726
it stops crying.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.437
Like, right away.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.731
Plus, I'm not afraid of poop.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.609
Or of accidentally killing it.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.654
Anymore.
[chuckles]

03:56.737 --> 03:57.863
Also, kids fucking love me.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.323
Seriously.

03:59.406 --> 04:03.035
The kid next door,
obsessed with me.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.621
He's very sweet,
actually.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.958
Tyler. He runs out to see me
whenever I get home.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.419
It's like he waits for me,
listening for my car.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.255
Like I got some creepy,
adorable stalker.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.427
[sighs]

04:20.511 --> 04:23.430
I used to baby-sit him.

04:23.514 --> 04:26.100
Back when we first moved in.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.602
Yeah, just weekends,
you know,

04:28.686 --> 04:31.021
or the odd evening
after school.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.774
It's not really a big deal.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.193
Well, I mean, it was
a big deal at the time,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.445
because I really
looked forward to it,

04:38.529 --> 04:42.783
but I hardly ever
think about it now.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.536
I wanted his dad to
sit on my face.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.704
I know.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.456
The truth is that Carl,
my neighbor,

04:49.540 --> 04:52.209
is the sexiest man on Earth.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.920
He's got those
tanned veiny hands

04:55.004 --> 04:59.341
that you can just imagine
fondling your breasts.

04:59.425 --> 05:01.468
I was going out to
take out the trash

05:01.552 --> 05:03.679
and he just appeared.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.806
Like a mirage.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.891
Leaning over the fence.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.977
"Hey, neighbor," he purred.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.229
His chiseled jaw
catching the light,

05:12.312 --> 05:16.608
and the trash bag split
and my ovaries exploded.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.235
It was like I went into
some kind of a weird trance.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.987
You know?

05:20.070 --> 05:23.240
I know that he was talking
something about lawnmowers,

05:23.323 --> 05:27.995
but all I could focus on
was his Adam's apple.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.414
So prominent.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.042
I had this overwhelming urge
to just suck it.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.794
And then his son came
bounding over, thank God.

05:35.878 --> 05:40.674
I think I agreed to baby-sit
purely out of embarrassment.

05:40.758 --> 05:44.511
That, and also, I wanted to
snoop around Carl's house

05:44.595 --> 05:47.014
and sniff his
dirty boxer shorts.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.476
I was gonna trick him into
falling in love with me.

05:50.559 --> 05:53.937
So it seems like
an excellent plan.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.814
But I really didn't know
how to baby-sit.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.484
Uh, and Tyler liked to
talk about Spider-Man.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.777
Did I know that Spider-Man
could build a web

05:59.860 --> 06:02.071
strong enough to hold
The Hulk?

06:02.154 --> 06:04.323
Did I know that Spider-Man
could bench press

06:04.406 --> 06:06.492
ten tons
at 200 miles per hour?

06:06.575 --> 06:08.952
After a while,
I just started to say yes.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.662
Cutting him off
before he could finish.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.498
Did I know that
Spider-Man... Yes.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.334
Did I know...
Fucking yes.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.044
Oh, I mean, I didn't say
the F word, obviously,

06:17.127 --> 06:18.629
but you get my drift.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.964
I mean, it's just hard work
pretending to be

06:21.048 --> 06:22.466
interested in somebody
when somebody is just,

06:22.549 --> 06:24.426
like, whittling on,
you know what I mean?

06:24.510 --> 06:27.179
Honestly,
I think I just thought

06:27.262 --> 06:28.972
there would be
a lot more sittin'.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.850
You know, just hanging out
in another person's house.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.436
Got to remember,
I wasn't being paid for this.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.896
I mean, Carl had offered,

06:35.979 --> 06:37.564
but I thought that
if I took the cash,

06:37.648 --> 06:39.316
he'd be less likely
to pay me in sex.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.443
I knew I had to make
the kid like me,

06:41.527 --> 06:44.446
because if the kid liked me,
then the dad would like me.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.198
So I let him run wild.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.325
Like a hooligan.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.244
He was riding his bike
in the house,

06:50.327 --> 06:52.162
having ice cream for dinner.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.373
Oh, it was so much fun.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.626
The most fun I had in years.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.837
I forgot that feeling,
you know?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.964
You know, just to be...

07:02.047 --> 07:04.800
free and fuckin' tear shit up.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.093
Oh...

07:06.176 --> 07:09.930
I felt like I could be myself
around Tyler.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.140
He didn't judge me.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.641
You know?

07:12.724 --> 07:15.310
And yeah, he talked about
Spider-Man a lot,

07:15.394 --> 07:18.105
and he could be a tedious,
dweeby little bore,

07:18.188 --> 07:21.483
but he was also just
really open.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.985
I mean, I know that sounds
ridiculous

07:23.068 --> 07:24.236
'cause I'm talking about
an eight-year-old,

07:24.319 --> 07:27.364
but... he'd listen to me.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.075
Like what I had to say
actually meant something.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.910
I have always found it
so difficult

07:31.994 --> 07:33.620
to open up to people.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.123
Ask anybody,
I'm a very closed book.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.211
And Tyler would
ask me questions.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.046
And I told him the truth.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.298
The actual truth.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.258
How I hated being
Jenny Taylor.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.220
How I didn't blame
my reproductive organs

07:50.304 --> 07:51.680
for rejecting me.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.767
How I didn't know if I could
ever love my own baby

07:55.851 --> 07:58.770
knowing that we shared
the same shitty DNA.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.367
I mean, he told me
about his life, too.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.286
How the little turds
in his class

08:14.369 --> 08:16.371
would bully him
about his glasses.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.540
I mean, I could see why,
they were fucking hideous,

08:18.624 --> 08:21.168
but...

08:21.251 --> 08:24.046
I felt this sort of
responsibility.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.381
Like I wanted to protect him.

08:26.465 --> 08:30.052
And then there was one day
where he just started to cry.

08:33.764 --> 08:38.727
And I remember that
I just held him close...

08:38.810 --> 08:41.605
this tiny lycra-clad
quivering body,

08:41.688 --> 08:44.858
and I started to cry, too.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.070
Unashamedly.

08:48.153 --> 08:53.575
We both just sat there on
the floor of his playroom

08:53.659 --> 08:56.495
sobbing into
each other's arms.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.706
Two snotty humans
just hurting.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.960
And afterwards,
he looked up at me...

09:03.043 --> 09:05.963
his disproportionately
magnified red eyes

09:06.046 --> 09:08.298
without a hint of malice,

09:08.382 --> 09:10.384
and he said,

09:10.467 --> 09:12.219
"Vivian said you were sad."

09:14.805 --> 09:18.100
And in that moment,
as I looked back at him,

09:18.183 --> 09:22.396
I knew that Carl had
a fucking girlfriend.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.651
And I should have known,
actually,

09:27.734 --> 09:31.280
because there were
two toothbrushes

09:31.363 --> 09:32.572
in his bathroom.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.496
And, of course,
Carl had a girlfriend.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.581
Why wouldn't Carl have
a girlfriend?

09:44.876 --> 09:46.336
[clattering]

09:46.420 --> 09:48.005
Motherfucker!

09:48.088 --> 09:49.047
Ugh!

09:49.131 --> 09:51.717
I met her, eventually.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.802
This "girlfriend."

09:53.885 --> 09:56.471
Annoyingly beautiful.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.265
One of those thin women
that you just know

09:58.348 --> 10:00.058
has all her pubes lasered off.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.186
French looking. I mean,
she is fuckin' French.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.314
But she also looks French.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.983
In an expensive
Breton top way,

10:08.066 --> 10:10.444
not in the garlicky way.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.946
Worst of all,
she's fucking nice. Ugh!

10:15.282 --> 10:17.367
I felt kind of pathetic
after I saw her.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.453
Kind of silly.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.079
I mean, to think that Carl
would ever look twice

10:21.163 --> 10:22.956
at somebody like me.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.499
I still carried on
babysitting, though.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.294
Not because of Carl,
obviously,

10:27.377 --> 10:30.672
even though he was still
the sexiest man on Earth,

10:30.756 --> 10:32.007
but because of Tyler.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.927
Yeah. I grew fond of
the little dweeb.

10:36.011 --> 10:39.890
As I used to wander around
Tyler's messy lived-in house

10:39.973 --> 10:42.225
in my bare feet,

10:42.309 --> 10:45.020
I used to imagine that
it was my house,

10:45.103 --> 10:46.480
that I lived there,

10:46.563 --> 10:50.609
that it was me who was
perfect and French.

10:50.692 --> 10:54.613
I used to try on her shoes,
painful little pointy things.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.407
I had a bath once
in their en suite.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.784
Ahh.
And one night,

10:58.867 --> 11:02.579
after I made sure
Tyler was asleep,

11:02.662 --> 11:04.414
I went to their bedroom.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.542
I looked at myself again
in their full-length mirror,

11:07.626 --> 11:10.212
and I told myself out loud

11:10.295 --> 11:12.214
how beautiful I was.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.299
How I was too good for them.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.676
How I was
a nice fucking person

11:16.760 --> 11:20.055
who deserved a man like Carl
and a hairless French vagina.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.891
And then I just started
to get undressed.

11:22.974 --> 11:26.770
Mm... first my dress,
then my underwear,

11:26.853 --> 11:29.398
'til I just stood there
stark buck naked,

11:29.481 --> 11:33.693
wearing nothing but a smile
and her painful pointy shoes.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.363
[chuckles]

11:36.446 --> 11:39.574
And I think I must have been
very drunk,

11:39.658 --> 11:42.285
and I must have dozed off,

11:42.369 --> 11:43.703
because next thing you know,

11:43.787 --> 11:47.457
I am awoken by this
God almighty scream.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.209
"Why are you in our bed?

11:49.292 --> 11:51.044
"Why are you naked?

11:51.128 --> 11:53.422
Out of my shoes!"

11:53.505 --> 11:56.758
And, obviously, all
the screaming woke up Tyler,

11:56.842 --> 11:58.635
who just stood at
the top of the stairs

11:58.718 --> 12:00.387
asking me what was wrong.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.598
"Don't worry.
Everything's fine,"

12:03.682 --> 12:05.892
I told him.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.519
But Carl threw me
out of the house

12:07.602 --> 12:09.104
and he hissed in my face,

12:09.187 --> 12:11.106
"Don't you ever
come around here again.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.234
"If I ever see you
so much as talk to Tyler,

12:14.317 --> 12:15.944
I'm gonna call the police."

12:16.027 --> 12:18.447
It was really humiliating.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.490
There was such hatred
in his eyes,

12:20.574 --> 12:23.827
and, like, he thought
I was a monster.

12:23.910 --> 12:28.457
And so I never went back
after that.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.667
And I don't think they ever
told Tyler what happened,

12:30.750 --> 12:32.752
which is a good thing.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.171
And it would break my heart

12:34.254 --> 12:36.965
when he would come
running out to see me,

12:37.048 --> 12:38.508
and I'd have to ignore him.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.054
His sad little voice
calling over the fence,

12:43.138 --> 12:46.349
"Jenny. Jenny, why don't you
like me anymore?"

12:49.436 --> 12:51.354
I think I might have been
his only friend.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.028
In many ways,
he was kind of mine.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.866
And our two houses
share a driveway,

13:02.949 --> 13:05.577
and still, now,
to this day,

13:05.660 --> 13:09.289
whenever I get home,
he comes running out to see me.

13:09.372 --> 13:14.252
This little Spider-Man figurine
taps on my Alfa Romeo window.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.674
I mean, it's kind of annoying,
actually,

13:19.758 --> 13:21.510
'cause he's scratching
the glass.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.013
I still masturbate over
the pointy shoes.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.237
I just wish I could remember

14:26.032 --> 14:28.493
I was at the party...

14:28.577 --> 14:31.997
but I wasn't drinking.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.375
And there were so many

14:40.046 --> 14:41.881

just showed me

14:41.965 --> 14:45.135
an endless VR of
his son sleeping.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.971
Since when did sleeping
become a spectator sport?

Just beige conversation
with beige people

14:54.561 --> 14:57.147
eating beige food...

14:57.230 --> 14:59.316
and it was giving me
a stomachache,

14:59.399 --> 15:02.986
so I went and I hid in
the downstairs bathroom.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.198
It was quiet in there.

15:07.282 --> 15:12.495
The hum of the fan
was like white noise,

15:12.579 --> 15:15.707
and I let it wash over me
as I sat on the toilet

15:15.790 --> 15:18.460
with my underwear
around my ankles.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.212
It had been four weeks.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.424
Four weeks of waiting.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.220
I thought it had
finally worked this time.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.767
I was five days late.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.563
And I knew I would love her.

15:38.647 --> 15:41.650
Because Tyler had shown me
that I was worthy of love.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.154
And I didn't feel it inside me

15:46.237 --> 15:49.032
this new missing piece.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.326
You know,
my body just told me.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.203
My nipples were sore.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.122
I had this weird
metallic taste in my mouth.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.794
But, um...

16:00.877 --> 16:02.545
then I saw it on the tissue.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.298
Blood.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.009
So much blood.

16:12.055 --> 16:16.601
The missing piece
I had been praying for...

16:16.685 --> 16:18.144
dead in my underwear.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.190
You know, I don't even know
how long I was in there,

16:22.273 --> 16:25.902
but somebody was
banging on the door,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.571
and I didn't have
any stuff with me,

16:28.655 --> 16:30.448
so I just ransacked
the cupboards,

16:30.532 --> 16:32.242
but there wasn't anything.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.244
I could just find
tissue paper and...

16:34.327 --> 16:36.996
I already blocked up the toilet
so I just...

16:37.080 --> 16:38.957
got out of there
as fast as I could,

16:39.040 --> 16:43.795
and didn't make eye contact
with anyone in the line.

16:43.878 --> 16:47.048
And I walked
straight over to the buffet,

16:47.132 --> 16:51.052
and I poured myself
a large glass of Pinot Grigio.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.805
[chuckles]
And I downed it.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.932
And then
I poured myself another,

16:56.015 --> 16:58.143
and I kept knocking 'em back

16:58.226 --> 17:00.562
until my heart
didn't hurt anymore,

17:00.645 --> 17:04.941
until I couldn't hear
all the two-year-olds playing,

17:05.024 --> 17:08.778
until I was numb and buzzied.

17:10.155 --> 17:13.074
And then it was like

17:13.158 --> 17:16.995
the party seemed
so much better then.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.831
Like it was suddenly full of
possibilities.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.500
I wanted to talk to people,
you know?

17:22.584 --> 17:24.961
And I was mingling with
the crowd.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.172
I was laughing and dancing.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.008
I was being really funny.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.301
I was being vivacious.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.428
I... I had this bottle of vodka

17:33.511 --> 17:36.264
and I was just pouring it
into people's mouths.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.934
And I could sense very clearly

17:40.018 --> 17:42.187
that Colin was pressed.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.064
So I dragged him
across the garden

17:45.148 --> 17:46.149
over to the drinks.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.318
"Colin needs a Bailey's!"

17:48.401 --> 17:49.986
[laughs]

17:50.069 --> 17:52.447
And I grabbed the bottle
out of the icy water,

17:52.530 --> 17:56.493
but then, uh, it was,
like, slippery and cold.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.037
And we fought over
the screw cap.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.040
And the next thing,
we're on the floor.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.458
[laughs]

18:03.541 --> 18:06.169
Absolutely hysterical.

18:06.252 --> 18:11.633
And I'm sloshing the Bailey's
all over his face.

18:11.716 --> 18:16.721
And then people start shouting,
crowding around us.

18:16.805 --> 18:20.475
And Lazlo's there, too,
like, his face is all red,

18:20.558 --> 18:22.185
and he's saying,
"You're embarrassing yourself,

18:22.268 --> 18:24.771
you need to go home."

18:24.854 --> 18:27.273
And it's nasty.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.067
And it's hostile.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.653
A sea of angry faces.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.656
And I can feel the shame
flushing my cheeks,

18:34.739 --> 18:38.243
and, you know,
I try to explain,

18:38.326 --> 18:40.453
but everybody hates me.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.247
People are pointing at me and...

18:42.330 --> 18:45.667
and then I could see
somebody laugh,

18:45.750 --> 18:49.671
"And I think we're all
aware of the situation."

18:49.754 --> 18:51.381
And I look down,

18:51.464 --> 18:53.883
and then I see that
I bled through my dress.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.347
[sniffles]

18:59.430 --> 19:01.266
And I just... I...

19:01.349 --> 19:04.060
I just need to
get out of there.

19:04.143 --> 19:10.233
So I... I push my way through
the barrier of bodies,

19:10.316 --> 19:13.361
hot, salty tears
stinging my eyes.

19:15.405 --> 19:18.324
And I just...
I need to go home.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.079
And I... I know that
I shouldn't drive,

19:23.162 --> 19:26.040
but it's only
around the block.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.793
So I stumbled into
my Alfa Romeo,

19:28.877 --> 19:32.088
and I scan my retina
to start the ignition,

19:32.171 --> 19:36.676
and I slam my foot hard
on the gas,

19:36.759 --> 19:41.055
speeding away from
all of the pain.

19:41.139 --> 19:45.059
And there's tears in my eyes
blurring my vision.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.646
The humiliation there,
it's still in the car,

19:48.730 --> 19:52.108
like an unwanted guest in
the passenger seat.

19:53.318 --> 19:56.029
And the road seems distorted,

19:56.112 --> 19:58.323
warped and unfamiliar,

19:58.406 --> 20:00.533
but I know that
I'm nearly there,

20:00.617 --> 20:04.829
so I cling onto
the steering wheel,

20:04.913 --> 20:07.624
and as I swerve around
the bend,

20:07.707 --> 20:10.627
and I could see my driveway,

20:10.710 --> 20:12.921
but I'm... I'm gaining speed.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.006
Flash of the mailbox.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.925
I rub at my eyes.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.052
I'm losing control.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.095
But I slammed on the brakes,
