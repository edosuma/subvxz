WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:05.480
Just follow procedure.
No one go off the list, okay.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.280
Don't panic anyone, keep it nice and calm.
Any questions...

00:08.360 --> 00:10.480
I'll be back at the MCU, okay.
Off you go.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.720
Hey. Body's in there.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.960
No sign of the girl.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.880
-Yeah, it's him, no doubt.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.960
That guy over there, that's Dad,
and the girl's name is May.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.640
Hi, there, sir. I'm DI Rav Sangha.
This is DS Marcella Backland.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.760
Have you found her?
Have you heard anything?

00:27.840 --> 00:29.040
I'm afraid not yet, no.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.000
When was the last time
you saw May

00:33.040 --> 00:35.360
I got a text about
an extra delivery, a last-minute thing.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.480
Who was she with?

00:36.560 --> 00:39.720
Beth, my neighbour,
she babysits.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.880
Yeah, if I get a late call-out,
I carry May over.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.360
I'll put her in Beth's bed.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.720
And she loves waking up there,
Beth spoils her.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.880
And what time was that?

00:46.960 --> 00:49.560
Jackpot247 was finishing,
so around 3:00.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.640
And what time did you get back?

00:50.720 --> 00:52.080
A few minutes after 4:00.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.960
It was just a short airport run,
you know?

00:54.040 --> 00:57.200
And then I went to Beth's...
and I found her.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.240
I appreciate
this is really difficult for you--

01:02.280 --> 01:03.320
You just said
that May liked waking up there,

01:03.400 --> 01:05.240
so why did you go over?

01:07.440 --> 01:08.720
Because the door was open,

01:08.800 --> 01:10.240
but it was dark in the flat so I thought

01:10.320 --> 01:12.320
Okay.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.960
Where are you going?

01:14.040 --> 01:15.960
He talks too much,
too much detail.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.600
Marcella, he's in shock.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.120
Yes, or well-rehearsed.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.440
Marcella?

01:29.080 --> 01:30.080
Oh, Christ. Anything?

01:35.200 --> 01:38.400
Yeah, they found some strands of hair
in her right hand. Not hers.

01:38.840 --> 01:39.960
DNA?

01:40.040 --> 01:41.720
Yeah, looks like it.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.600
Poor girl.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.040
What did you do with her?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.400
You didn't put her in Beth's bed.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.320
No, no, I normally do, but...

02:04.400 --> 02:05.640
Don't lie to me.
Do not lie to me.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.840
What did you do with that little girl?

02:06.920 --> 02:08.680
You're her father,
you're supposed to keep her safe,

02:08.760 --> 02:10.240
and I want to know
what you did with that little girl.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
Nothing! Tell me what you did
with your little girl!

02:12.480 --> 02:13.600
Nothing!

02:15.680 --> 02:18.040
What did you do--
In her room. On her own.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.800
You left her sleeping
in her room alone at night?

02:22.880 --> 02:24.760
A six-year-old child.
Are you out of your mind?

02:26.520 --> 02:28.120
Did you tell your neighbour?

02:28.200 --> 02:31.800
I thought if I told you I'd lose custody,
that you'd take her away.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.640
Well, we'll have to find her
before we can do that, won't we?

03:20.120 --> 03:21.840
<i>Eyewitness saw a man</i>
<i>in a dark hoodie</i>

03:21.920 --> 03:23.400
<i>carrying a little girl</i>
<i>through the estate.</i>

03:23.480 --> 03:25.800
DS Backland,
I've got the footage

03:25.880 --> 03:27.080
outside the flat.

03:29.680 --> 03:33.600
Oh, my God. May!
What's he doing with her?

03:35.320 --> 03:37.520
And the other angle!

03:38.680 --> 03:40.440
Freeze it there. Punch in! So she was alive when he took her!

03:49.960 --> 03:53.080
Why wouldn't I be?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.480
Come on.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.800
Her backpack.

04:53.640 --> 04:54.800
Have you found her backpack?

04:54.880 --> 04:56.240
Why do you ask?

04:56.320 --> 04:58.400
She must have it.
Then she's got her phone.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.520
-Yeah.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.640
It's on, you can track it.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.160
How do you know it's on?
You didn't call it, did you?

05:05.240 --> 05:06.360
Yeah. But she didn't pick up.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.440
-If it's still on,

05:08.520 --> 05:11.240
the person who took your daughter
might also have heard it.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.360
Located her phone signal.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.760
They're travelling fast.
Driving east.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.680
Okay, get mobile units there right away.
And find that car.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.160
Over here.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.800
-Come on.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.920
Because, Alex, she's still alive.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.160
Yeah, but we don't think
he's going to keep her that way, do we?

06:10.240 --> 06:12.080
<i>There was a car</i>
<i>reported stolen on a street</i>

06:12.160 --> 06:13.240
<i>behind Ronnie Weir's house.</i>

06:13.320 --> 06:15.400
<i>The ANPR picked up the car</i>
<i>two minutes ago.</i>

06:15.480 --> 06:17.680
<i>-I'll send it through.</i>
Tell me there's someone there.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.120
Come on, come on, come on.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.800
He's down by the river.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.640
Marcella!

06:34.160 --> 06:36.760
Marcella! Marcella!

06:44.760 --> 06:46.760
Please, dear God,
don't let it be her.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.360
Come on!

06:48.440 --> 06:51.680
I'm requesting urgent backup now.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.080
May!

07:24.600 --> 07:25.800
No!

07:56.920 --> 07:58.320
No, no!

08:03.080 --> 08:04.080
May!

08:04.160 --> 08:05.760
Oh, God!

08:07.320 --> 08:08.320
Oh, God!

08:19.000 --> 08:21.760
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

08:21.840 --> 08:23.400
This is DI Rav Sangha,
I need an ambulance

08:23.480 --> 08:25.360
and a full SOCO unit
down to wasteland

08:25.440 --> 08:27.680
-adjacent to London City Airport.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.760
-I need it now!
One, two, three,

08:29.840 --> 08:32.160
-four, five, six, seven, eight...
Alex, get a defib.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.800
...nine, ten.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.880
One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight...

08:39.760 --> 08:41.200
Come on.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.960
Come on, Juliet.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.920
...three, four, five.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.800
One, two, three...

08:47.880 --> 08:49.600
Please, darling.
Come on, Juliet.

08:49.680 --> 08:50.960
Marcella. Marcella.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.960
-Come on, baby.
Marcella.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.000
-Marcella, she's gone. She's gone.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.440
-Come on.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.560
Where have you been at this hour?

10:28.640 --> 10:29.720
For a drive.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.080
-Couldn't sleep.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.120
No.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.360
-Nowhere.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.680
Just... driving around.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.520
Well, after today
there will be a grave to go to.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.720
I'm gonna get a shower.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.240
I want you to go home,
get some sleep.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.280
Get out of here,
do something normal.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.640
Grace Gibson's funeral is at 3:00.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.000
-One of you, with a photographer.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.360
Hi, erm, sorry.
Is it okay if I...

11:18.440 --> 11:19.920
Sure, what is it, Mark?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.360
I just heard from forensics.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.240
The DNA results from the hair
found in the babysitter's hand

11:25.320 --> 11:26.560
won't be back till tomorrow.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.200
Thanks, Mark.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.560
Where's Marcella?

11:30.640 --> 11:32.480
She burnt her hand,
she's getting it looked at.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.760
-She'll be fine.
-Okay, good.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.560
Well, erm,
I got a lot to do so...

11:42.240 --> 11:44.000
Yeah, me too.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.000
Who's Juliet?

11:52.560 --> 11:54.120
-Mmm-hmm.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.920
Her daughter.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.440
She would have been six now.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.520
Hi.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.000
Hi.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.320
You want an update?

12:46.880 --> 12:48.040
Okay, so, erm...

12:48.960 --> 12:51.000
we had to release Bendek Krol.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.480
Didn't have enough to keep him.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.720
And, er...

12:54.800 --> 12:57.880
There's no sign
of Mohammed El-Sayed.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.240
I mean, he hasn't
left the country as far as we know.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.680
We've put out a general warrant for him.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.520
There was, er, something else...

13:26.280 --> 13:28.160
Hey, it's Mum.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.080
<i>Mum?</i>
<i>What'd you want?</i>

13:32.240 --> 13:33.680
Nothing, I, erm...

13:36.800 --> 13:37.840
<i>Mum?</i>

13:39.640 --> 13:41.600
I just wanted to hear your voice.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.400
What are you doing?

13:45.480 --> 13:46.880
<i>Speaking to you.</i>

13:46.960 --> 13:48.920
No.
Before I called, silly.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.160
<i>Oh, got netball, gotta go.</i>
<i>Love you, Mum.</i>

14:03.960 --> 14:05.200
Tim!

14:07.600 --> 14:12.120
-Just dropped Marcella off.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.360
You're looking better
than the last time I saw you.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.480
What were you doing at my house?

14:19.560 --> 14:21.760
You left her, man.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.440
Well, we're still married.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.800
-So keep away from her.
-Is there an "or else" coming, or...

14:28.120 --> 14:29.600
Just stay away from her.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.640
Bendek?

14:52.720 --> 14:53.800
Yes?

14:53.880 --> 14:55.360
I need to talk to you.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.280
I'm sorry,
but you can't stay here any more.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.920
You are kicking me out?

15:05.880 --> 15:08.040
We're not comfortable
with you living here.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.160
You got till the end of the week.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.640
It's about the police.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.360
Yeah. It's that.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.000
And the fighting.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.840
Wait...

15:27.640 --> 15:29.040
I paid.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.000
I paid for a whole month.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.440
I want you out.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.040
I can't go.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.080
What is it now?

16:09.360 --> 16:12.800
The thing is, just that I can't...
I can't deal with death right now.

16:12.880 --> 16:16.120
It's just one thing too many,
you know?

16:18.120 --> 16:20.480
I can't go. I, er...

16:20.560 --> 16:21.920
I just can't.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.080
Okay. Well, I'll, erm...

16:26.160 --> 16:28.000
I'll just go straight home
after the ceremony.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.920
So, you're going?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.680
Yeah, it's Grace.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.720
I drove all the way here
to pay my respects.

16:35.800 --> 16:36.800
I'm going.

16:39.720 --> 16:40.960
Hurry back home.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.680
<i>Grace saved me.</i>

16:48.200 --> 16:49.520
Grace saved my life.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.720
When our dad died...

16:54.880 --> 16:56.520
I ran away.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.320
<i>And in all the years</i>
<i>that I was travelling...</i>

17:01.240 --> 17:03.840
<i>Grace never stopped...</i>

17:04.600 --> 17:07.320
calling and writing...

17:08.480 --> 17:12.120
letting me know
that I was important to her.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.720
I think she made a lot of people
feel like that.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.280
<i>Maybe that was her gift.</i>

17:25.960 --> 17:28.480
'Cause that's what
makes life worth living.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.920
When people...

17:35.720 --> 17:38.720
let you know that you matter...

17:39.760 --> 17:41.000
to them.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.080
I'm sorry.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.840
Hey.
-Hi.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.600
You, er...

18:39.680 --> 18:41.680
you weren't in the briefing.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.400
Not that you missed much.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.520
The car he used
was reported stolen this morning

18:48.600 --> 18:51.800
and there's no facial shots
from the cameras we know he passed.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.920
Whereabouts of Mohammed El-Sayed
is still unknown--

18:54.000 --> 18:55.840
I know, Mark told me.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.560
What about DNA of the hair we found?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.440
There's no match yet.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.920
And there's no cameras
outside the Premier Lodge

19:05.000 --> 19:07.440
that can help us with the man
who took the keycard.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.400
Marcella, Laura...

19:19.320 --> 19:21.440
Laura told me about Juliet.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.440
I'm so sorry.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.600
I have a seven-year-old at home.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.960
Sany. She's my oldest.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.880
-Sonam's five.
-I didn't know.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.280
Are you okay?

19:39.600 --> 19:42.760
I have to ask,
are you still able to be a part of this?

19:43.760 --> 19:45.000
Yes, I am.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.720
I have to find him.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.240
Look, May has forced him to improvise.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.440
He is bound to have made mistakes.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.200
We're gonna get him.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.840
Oh, I'm sorry.
Er, thank you so much for coming.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.360
Should we send flowers
to Andrew Barnes' widow?

20:52.440 --> 20:55.000
We didn't know him that well,
and her, not at all.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.760
But we did business together.
She is an MP.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.680
We should, shouldn't we?

21:01.520 --> 21:04.000
Any idea who his replacement might be?

21:04.080 --> 21:05.680
Oh, there are some options.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.040
Do we know anything about these options?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.360
Daughton has intel on everyone
in the planning committee.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.400
Barnes' replacement.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.160
Well, as soon as we find out who it is,
I'll send him the new plan straight away.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.880
That plan was a good one
when Andrew Barnes was alive.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.480
But maybe...

21:22.560 --> 21:25.520
we can persuade his replacement
to go back to the original.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.000
Get the intel on the others.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.360
Thanks, Jason.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.280
The new plan is sustainable
and has a green space. It has everything that was stated
in the planning agreement.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.920
And we make decent money.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.120
Yeah, but not as much.
It was a compromise.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.040
This is how we're going to
have to do business in the future.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.720
Your way?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.680
Listening to me, yeah.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.280
Yes, but the future isn't here yet, is it?

22:00.560 --> 22:02.320
What?

22:05.920 --> 22:07.480
<i>Andrew Barnes.</i>

22:07.560 --> 22:09.560
Overdosed on antidepressants.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.080
A presumed suicide.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.440
Come on, you know
I don't like it down here.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.000
Just make it quick.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.280
It's a tracheal contusion

22:16.360 --> 22:18.840
consistent with a solid object
being pushed down his oesophagus.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.320
In English.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.560
Someone's pushed something
down his throat.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.160
Right.
So, why didn't you just say so?

22:24.240 --> 22:25.720
I went to med school.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.800
Someone shoved what?

22:29.880 --> 22:31.560
Wouldn't like to say.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.160
Thin enough to fit his throat,
thick enough to injure it.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.400
Someone fed him
an overdose of antidepressants?

22:37.480 --> 22:38.560
Mmm. Probably.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.320
The injuries occurred
less than an hour before his death.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.760
So you're telling me
that Andrew Barnes was murdered?

22:44.840 --> 22:46.880
I'm telling you,
you can't rule it out.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.000
Why is it so dark in here?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.000
Oh, my God!

23:21.080 --> 23:22.680
Hi, Mum.
Hello.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.320
Hey, gorgeous.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.480
What a nice surprise!

23:27.560 --> 23:29.640
Okay, enough.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.840
-Yeah.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.320
Mmm

23:33.480 --> 23:34.600
Is this your work, Mum?

23:34.680 --> 23:36.080
Eddie, don't look at that.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.600
Is this your job?

23:37.680 --> 23:41.120
Erm, yeah, and it's not for you,
nosy parker. Go on.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.440
You need to cover it up, Marcella.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.920
Right. Help me.
-Yeah.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.400
What are you doing here?

23:49.480 --> 23:50.720
What do you mean?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.160
It's family dinner.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.240
We agreed we needed it.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.480
We did?

23:57.560 --> 23:59.560
When I picked you up
this morning.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.480
From the hospital.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.360
Sorry, my mind was elsewhere.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.080
I didn't realise
you meant tonight.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.760
So dinner is...

24:08.840 --> 24:10.560
Well, it's non-existent.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.560
All right, change of plan.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.080
Who wants Thai?

24:14.160 --> 24:15.200
Yeah!
Me!

24:26.960 --> 24:28.600
You should try
to eat something.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.440
Will this be enough?

24:40.320 --> 24:41.680
With her gone...

24:42.600 --> 24:44.360
will I be enough?

24:49.760 --> 24:51.760
Nothing ever happened.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.320
Just seeing how happy you were
when she was in the room.

25:00.480 --> 25:01.760
You loved her.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.400
Like a daughter, yes.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.000
Not the way you think.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.160
I'm not sure I believe that.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.160
I miss her.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.200
I'll always miss her.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.080
But, yes...

25:36.600 --> 25:38.240
this will be enough.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.920
The coin is here.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.240
That's great.
Well done.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.480
I'm doing eight more tricks
at my talent show.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.760
Will you come?

25:59.840 --> 26:02.720
Of course.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.720
-Of course, of course I'll come.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.840
Hey.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.600
I can't wait to see you up on that stage.

26:10.680 --> 26:11.760
Cheeky.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.120
Great.
So what else has been happening?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.360
I got a B in the last chemistry test.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.040
That's rubbish. I get A's!
-Hey!

26:23.120 --> 26:24.360
Seriously.
-Eddie...

26:24.440 --> 26:25.880
-I will hit you.
Okay, stop it.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.520
Enough!
Hey.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.400
Do not play with prawn crackers.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.520
You'll never make it
in the NBA, Mum.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.120
Why?

26:34.200 --> 26:35.440
Oi.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.040
I thought tonight went well.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.160
Yeah.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.640
You seemed a bit...

26:45.560 --> 26:46.560
off.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.400
I was just thinking...

26:51.840 --> 26:54.680
It dawned on me
that everybody just leaves...

26:55.440 --> 26:57.200
or they're taken away.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.960
You blame me for the kids
going to boarding school.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.080
I blame you for everything.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.440
Except Juliet, you know that.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.200
I think they needed to get away.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.520
So you're saying it's my fault?

27:16.560 --> 27:17.560
Hmm?

27:18.480 --> 27:20.680
Are you saying
that I drive people away?

27:22.280 --> 27:23.960
Even my own children?

27:25.280 --> 27:27.040
For six years...

27:27.120 --> 27:29.280
-I tried to--
-You tried for three.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.480
I know about Grace.
Tim told me.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.280
It was three years, Jason.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.320
For three years...

27:45.360 --> 27:46.920
I wanted us to move on...

27:47.840 --> 27:49.160
to get our lives back.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.240
Get what back?
What'd we lost?

27:53.520 --> 27:54.760
We lost us.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.280
How we used to be.

27:56.360 --> 28:00.000
We had ten amazing years.
That's more than most people have.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.200
And things change. Of course they did.
But we dealt with that.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.920
You deal with it.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.440
Things were different,
they weren't bad.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.720
It wasn't bad,
but it wasn't good enough.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.280
We lost us.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.040
And that was always our strength,

28:14.120 --> 28:16.720
-that connection that we had.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.080
And I couldn't reach you.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.920
Like I said before,
I felt lonely.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
What, and you're not lonely now?

28:27.640 --> 28:28.680
Yeah.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.200
I am.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.200
Well, maybe if you'd have
talked to me about it, then...

28:39.120 --> 28:40.760
we wouldn't be here now.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.520
I came back for Grace.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.840
To grow up.

28:55.920 --> 28:58.040
Finally get involved
in the family business.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.120
But Grace is gone.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.160
Sylvie doesn't care
about anything that I do.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.160
Sylvie is going through a lot right now.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.440
Sylvie has made me feel
like a failure my entire life.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.720
So...

29:12.720 --> 29:14.560
I just need to succeed at one thing.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.840
You fixed Lambeth.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.440
Yeah, but now she's changed
her mind about that again.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.760
What?
I don't care, you can't leave.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.240
What's the point in staying?

29:33.360 --> 29:34.440
Yep.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.160
Shit.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.600
I should probably go.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.400
Did he bury his sister today?

29:45.280 --> 29:47.120
<i>Can't get to the phone right now.</i>

29:47.200 --> 29:48.240
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

30:16.800 --> 30:18.200
All right, bubba.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.920
You take care, okay?
I love you.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.160
Bye.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.840
Look after your sister, bubba.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.080
-I will.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.640
-Love you.
-I'll see you soon. I love you, too.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.600
Bye, guys.
Bye.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.400
Let's go.
I call shotgun.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.720
I want them to come home.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.000
-I think you should ask what they want.
-They didn't ask to go.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.680
They're there because it suited you
and now I want it to suit me.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.600
Okay, I'm not going to fight you on this,
but I think you should ask them.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.960
-All right.
-They like it there, Marcella.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.800
Okay, I... Bye.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.920
Look after your hand.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.280
Listen up.
Forensics just called.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.720
We've got a match
on the hair from Beth's hand.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.960
D&amp;D from a few years back.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.200
Let's finish this.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.800
Open up. Police!

32:05.880 --> 32:06.880
Go on, just break it down.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.640
Yann Hall,
I'm arresting you

32:20.720 --> 32:22.760
on the suspicion of the murder
of Beth Bachan

32:22.840 --> 32:24.640
and the kidnap and murder of May Weir.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.200
You do not have to say anything.
But anything that you do say

32:27.280 --> 32:30.400
may be used in court
or in evidence against you.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.000
Hello?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.160
-Okay.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.880
Yann Hall.

33:01.520 --> 33:02.800
That's Matthew Neil's boyfriend.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.360
That's the computer bloke
we spoke to about the sex chat.

33:05.440 --> 33:08.240
Wait until the solicitor gets here.
See what the search of the house gives us.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.120
-Keep me in the loop.
-Okay.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.440
Good job.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.760
I shouldn't be here.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.840
No one says anything.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.800
Linda?

33:48.080 --> 33:49.320
Stuart?

34:18.040 --> 34:19.760
You don't return my calls.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.040
Why would I?

34:21.120 --> 34:22.840
Well, to discuss our financial settlement.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.360
Is that the intel from Daughton
that I prepared for you?

34:26.440 --> 34:27.800
Yeah, so?

34:27.880 --> 34:30.520
Then you'll find that
I'm good at what I do.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.400
Very good.

34:37.720 --> 34:39.040
-You got till noon...

34:40.840 --> 34:44.560
otherwise I'll tell Sylvie about this.

34:44.640 --> 34:46.800
Then Marcella,
and the police.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.560
You got my number, don't you?

34:49.960 --> 34:51.760
<i>It's, erm,</i>
<i>DI Tim Williamson.</i>

34:51.840 --> 34:55.800
<i>I'm just looking into the circumstances</i>
<i>surrounding the death of Andrew Barnes.</i>

34:55.880 --> 34:58.720
No, we have to look into every suicide.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.240
Yes.

35:01.320 --> 35:02.880
Yeah, it's very tragic.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.120
Listen, erm...

35:05.200 --> 35:07.960
Did he, erm, upset anyone?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.960
Is anybody angry with him?

35:11.160 --> 35:12.480
Yeah.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.320
Well, maybe they didn't like
something he was doing.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.480
What's that?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.360
Mmm. Yes.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.800
And, er...

35:25.880 --> 35:27.600
who was the developer?

35:33.320 --> 35:35.920
Yes, I am familiar with them.
Thank you.

35:45.760 --> 35:49.160
Where were you
between 3:00 and 6:30 yesterday morning?

35:49.240 --> 35:52.200
-Yesterday, I was at home.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.280
Watching telly, asleep.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.840
-No. Er...

35:57.920 --> 36:00.880
My partner, he...
he works away a lot. So...

36:01.720 --> 36:03.560
In bed, asleep. Alone.

36:03.640 --> 36:04.920
-Yep.
-Mmm.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.040
What happened there?

36:07.360 --> 36:10.000
Er... burned myself.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.280
Was cooking. Why?

36:17.080 --> 36:21.000
What--
-A six-year-old girl was drowned.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.400
We found these in your house.

36:27.480 --> 36:31.920
The six-year-old girl's hands were tied
with ones just like that.

36:37.560 --> 36:38.640
And hers.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.520
And hers.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.560
-And his.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.520
And you see, there.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.640
Look, you see that around their necks?

36:50.720 --> 36:52.720
Yann, can you look at that?
What is that?

36:56.160 --> 36:57.240
That's right.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.600
Where do you think
we found that?

37:01.680 --> 37:04.200
Where did we find that, Yann?
I have no idea.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.760
-I don't know.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.680
We found it in a cupboard in your kitchen.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.160
Circumstantial at best.
Oh, we've got DNA.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.240
Your DNA. From the babysitter.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.880
Were you in a rush

37:14.960 --> 37:18.720
Did May walk in on you?
Did she scream or cry?

37:18.800 --> 37:20.760
Did she know that she was going to die?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.520
But you couldn't kill her,
could you?

37:23.600 --> 37:26.240
You couldn't kill her, so you just
threw her away, like a piece of rubbish.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.280
If she didn't freeze to death,
then she'd drown.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.920
As long as
you didn't have to see it, right?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
No, no, no.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.840
'Cause you're a fucking coward.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.640
You're a fucking coward--

37:40.400 --> 37:43.200
-Shut up! Shut up!

37:45.320 --> 37:48.320
Huh?

37:49.560 --> 37:51.360
You did it, didn't you?
You did it!

37:51.440 --> 37:53.440
I don't know
what you're talking about!

37:53.520 --> 37:55.440
I-- No--

38:11.960 --> 38:13.160
I want to stay.

38:16.680 --> 38:20.120
Well, I'm sorry, Bendek.
That's out of the question.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.680
Linda doesn't know,
does she?

38:27.760 --> 38:29.880
About you leaving?
Yes, she does.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.680
About your illness.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.600
The multiple sclerosis.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.680
You think that is going to
keep you here, do you?

38:48.320 --> 38:49.640
That you found out.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.680
I'll just tell her.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.560
I mean, got to,
sooner or later anyway.

38:59.880 --> 39:03.080
Are you going to tell her
about this as well?

39:07.400 --> 39:09.120
It says here...

39:09.200 --> 39:12.120
he was found a little after 2:00 a.m...

39:13.040 --> 39:14.080
two nights ago.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.840
End of the week, Bendek.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.160
According to the search history
on your computer,

39:25.240 --> 39:27.800
you searched for
"Andrew Barnes suicide,"

39:27.880 --> 39:30.560
"Barnes found dead,"
and, er...

39:30.640 --> 39:33.200
"MP Barnes husband dead,"

39:33.280 --> 39:35.920
from midnight onwards.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.440
That's two hours before he was found.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.480
I took a screenshot...

39:44.440 --> 39:46.280
and downloaded it.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.720
So I'm staying.

39:53.400 --> 39:57.760
Everywhere else will be so expensive,

39:57.840 --> 40:00.880
since I'm living here for free now...

40:54.680 --> 40:55.680
I...

40:57.080 --> 40:58.640
I haven't done anything.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.280
I'm not supposed to be here.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.160
I'm not supposed--
I'm not supposed to be here.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.600
Please, just, come, come--

41:08.600 --> 41:10.240
Come. I'm not...

41:14.880 --> 41:16.240
Never mind.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.080
You all right?

41:41.160 --> 41:43.040
I did not ask you to do anything...

41:44.160 --> 41:45.840
and this isn't saying that.

41:46.760 --> 41:51.320
This is so I never see
or hear from you again.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.520
Sure.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.680
Please just go--
Go and get someone, please!

42:36.480 --> 42:38.280
Get someone.
Get me... Get...

42:38.360 --> 42:40.080
-Get someone!

42:50.160 --> 42:52.760
Just breathe. Relax.
