WEBVTT

00:00.542 --> 00:04.212
(upbeat march music playing)

00:07.215 --> 00:09.342
TT on the mike.
You already know I'm a miggity.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.677
Make some noise

00:10.719 --> 00:13.555
for the baddest band
in the land,

00:13.596 --> 00:15.056
Prairie View A&M University,

00:15.098 --> 00:17.726
better known
as the Marching Storm.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.398
Jalen: Prairie View,
we're predominantly black,

00:23.440 --> 00:24.941
or HBCU.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.236
HBCU stands for
Historically Black College.

00:28.278 --> 00:31.740
Hammy: The HBCU style
is all about the culture
and the funkiness,

00:31.781 --> 00:33.324
getting down
and grooving with it.

00:33.366 --> 00:37.787
(slow drums and clarinet music
playing)

00:38.705 --> 00:40.915
(music intensifies)

00:40.957 --> 00:43.168
(drum solo)

00:43.209 --> 00:46.004
Woman: You have to be
high energy and high bass

00:46.046 --> 00:47.714
from march in to march out.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.758
Aaron: The HBCU culture
is competitive.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.176
We the most vicious things
on the block.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.098
Prairie View Marching Storm
definitely has a style.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.726
-The Storm is coming,
they know that.
-Take cover.

00:59.768 --> 01:04.022
Our performance level is
just far above any other band.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.400
Being in the Marching Storm
is a very prestigious
and coveted position.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.153
Next week no spot is guaranteed,
y'all know that.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.657
Dr. Zachery
is our band director.

01:14.699 --> 01:18.411
Remember, musicianship
over volume every day.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.496
All: Yes, sir.

01:19.537 --> 01:22.457
My first impression
of Dr. Zachery

01:22.499 --> 01:24.584
was definitely intimidation.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.919
Dr. Zachery:
That has to be bigger.

01:25.960 --> 01:26.878
All: Yes, sir.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.963
If he says do it, you do it.

01:29.005 --> 01:33.051
The main thing that scares me
is the way he talks.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.260
(deep voice):
Hello.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.470
What do you think
you need to improve on

01:35.512 --> 01:37.889
to be even considered
for this position?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.182
He was in the Army,
so, you know,

01:39.224 --> 01:39.891
the exercises are tough.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.683
Dr. Zachery: As much as
I love them as people,

01:40.725 --> 01:44.521
there has to be respect
for the job at all times,

01:44.562 --> 01:46.898
because if we get too friendly
we can't get things done.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.275
Man: When he tells you
something, you can't
really say nothing back

01:49.317 --> 01:51.736
because... he's right.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.363
The band's a family.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.074
We all are here together

01:56.116 --> 01:57.992
doing what we love
representing our school.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.037
Everybody is here
all day, every day.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.997
We never go home around here.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.415
They practice after practice.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.459
So you're forced
to look at these people.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.170
You're going to eventually
like them. (laughs)

02:09.212 --> 02:09.921
You gonna see the finest women
you ever see.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.048
There's one right there,
here's one right here.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.133
There's one right there.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.928
("Like Me"
by SaraoMusic playing)

02:16.970 --> 02:18.721
The band is full of romance.

02:18.763 --> 02:19.430
Me and Kevin was good friends

02:19.472 --> 02:22.433
and then we decided
to take it further.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.435
I do not
disencourage dating.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.645
You grown.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.896
Give me a kiss.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.815
But in here,
pick up your horn.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.359
TT:
We, the Marching Storm,

02:31.401 --> 02:33.903
dedicate ourselves
to a higher standard.

02:33.945 --> 02:38.825
Se, we all we got,
and we're all we need.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.620
Nehemiah:
The Marching Storm operates
like a well-oiled machine.

02:42.662 --> 02:46.541
We have 300
and something people.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.419
Every Marching Storm show
is definitely
catching to the eye

02:49.460 --> 02:50.587
and catching to the ear.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.882
(uplifting trombone music
playing)

02:57.468 --> 03:00.096
Jalen:
Prairie View A&M University
is a part of the SWAC.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.725
Hammy: The Southwestern
Athletic conference,

03:03.766 --> 03:07.061
which is a big conference
composed of many HBCUs

03:07.103 --> 03:10.023
across the southern region
of the United States.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.067
At the moment,
the band is ranked number eight

03:13.109 --> 03:14.861
by the ESPN Undefeated.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.866
Like, there's no way
that we rated that low.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.451
(groans softly)
Come on, now.

03:21.492 --> 03:22.493
(cheering)

03:22.493 --> 03:25.121
Dr. Zachery:
If you rank number eight,
there's a reason to practice

03:25.163 --> 03:26.873
'cause you wanna
get to number one.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.710
You gonna rank us number eight?
We take things personally, bro.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.171
Dr. Zachery:
We are going to get in here
and grind every day

03:33.213 --> 03:35.673
to be the very best
that we can be.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.968
Aaron: I expect the Storm
to be able to handle it,

03:39.010 --> 03:40.553
because we're the best.

03:40.595 --> 03:44.432
(upbeat music playing)

03:49.354 --> 03:51.898
(peppy drum music playing)

03:56.277 --> 03:59.113
TT: KPVU 91.3.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.740
It's your girl TT on the mike

04:00.782 --> 04:03.993
miggity-making some noise
on the Midday Jam.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.625
Homecomin' is comin' to
Prairie View A&M University.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.336
And you already know
what the vibes are gonna be.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.546
(vocalizing)

04:15.588 --> 04:19.092
("Run Ricky Run"
by Canon and & Cardec playing)

04:23.054 --> 04:25.223
(whistle blowing rhythmically)

04:29.227 --> 04:31.646
(song continues)

04:43.908 --> 04:45.743
Five, six, seven.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.874
One, two, three, four,

04:51.916 --> 04:54.752
five, six, seven, eight.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.297
(all grunt)

04:57.964 --> 04:59.048
Whoo!

04:59.090 --> 05:01.968
(whistle blowing rhythmically)

05:02.010 --> 05:05.388
How about instead of we all try
to start the front right here?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.557
How about we move
the front of the line up some?

05:07.598 --> 05:09.851
'Cause that would be what,
like four off the hash.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.020
Think of it as
us moving the lines like this.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.313
(indistinct chatter)

05:13.354 --> 05:14.564
My name is Aaron.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.483
I'm a senior
and I'm a drum major.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.819
Drum major is always
the leader of the band.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.988
Some schools, your drum majors,

05:22.030 --> 05:25.700
they might not dance all around
or do everything like that,

05:25.742 --> 05:27.702
but the drum majors
in HBCU culture

05:27.744 --> 05:29.245
are kind of viewed
as superstars

05:29.287 --> 05:30.955
because we just
get funky with it.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.832
(indistinct chatter)

05:32.874 --> 05:35.126
It's good now
'cause it doesn't go on four.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.963
It was just me
trying to get... seven, eight.

05:41.007 --> 05:41.966
Like, you know what I'm sayin'?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.384
That's a long ways to go.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.512
Just this one, one, two.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.848
And Aaron, he gotta
groove it backwards.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.308
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Jalen: I gotta do it forwards.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.435
'Cause I'm the end
and he's the front.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.354
My name is
Jalen McCurtis-Henry

05:54.395 --> 05:58.191
and I am a drum major
for the best band in the land,

05:58.232 --> 06:00.068
Prairie View A&M Marching Storm.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.154
I won Mr. Marching Storm
in 2018.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.073
Da, da, da.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.657
I'm currently
holding that title

06:06.699 --> 06:08.368
'cause we haven't had
another pageant.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.870
The role of a drum major
is being the bridge

06:10.912 --> 06:13.289
between the band
and the directors.

06:13.331 --> 06:17.293
The band look at us
for dances, songs,

06:17.335 --> 06:19.754
marches, cadences, all of that.

06:19.796 --> 06:24.675
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine, nine, up.

06:26.969 --> 06:30.556
Common misconceptions
about marching band students,

06:30.598 --> 06:32.100
I know a lot of schools,

06:32.141 --> 06:34.018
they see 'em as like
just band geeks

06:34.060 --> 06:36.312
or, you know,
music nerds or whatever.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.147
HBCU bands are set apart

06:38.189 --> 06:40.817
because we are the celebrities
of the band world.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.736
Five, six, seven, eight.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.906
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.742
One, two, three, four.

06:49.784 --> 06:53.121
PV has its own style
of drum majors.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.373
Five, six...

06:55.415 --> 06:57.750
(grunting) Kick, kick.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.420
It is flashy, swag,

07:00.461 --> 07:02.338
and at the end of the day,
we trendsetters.

07:02.380 --> 07:06.759

Hammy:
From the top.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.595
One, two, three, four,

07:09.637 --> 07:11.597
five, six, seven, eight.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.766
(marching band music plays)

07:15.268 --> 07:16.352
Let's do it again.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.938
So the arms are from out,

07:18.980 --> 07:20.690
you keep your other arm up.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.066
The rotating is
the only one that drops.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.152
A lot of us are doing this.

07:24.193 --> 07:27.029
My name is Kaylan Hammond
also known as Hammy,

07:27.071 --> 07:28.781
and I am the captain
of the Black Foxes.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.740
All right, let's do it again.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.576
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.828
As captain, I always have to
make sure the Black Foxes

07:33.870 --> 07:36.456
are, you know, Black Foxes,
'cause that's what we are.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.291
We have to stay sassy, cute,

07:38.332 --> 07:40.835
sometimes sexy,
but not too sexy.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.336
You know, we got to
keep it clean for the mamas.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.838
Push through.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.590
Seven. One.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.926
I really respect
every HBCU dance team out there

07:48.968 --> 07:50.887
because it takes
a special type of person

07:50.928 --> 07:53.181
and a special type
of skill set for you to do it.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.348
'Cause this isn't easy.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.057
This is tiring.

07:55.099 --> 07:58.060
This is hard work.
This is perseverance.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.354
This is every single day.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.607
Wesley: Can I see it?

08:02.648 --> 08:04.650
I want y'all two,
front two lines, sit.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.528
Five, six, seven, eight,

08:07.570 --> 08:11.324
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.827
Oh-oh.

08:14.869 --> 08:19.749
I am Shelbi Durand,
and I am a Black Fox.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.918
I didn't put
my foot down that time.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.920
Because it's too fast
on the eighth, bro.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.296
You the only one that can
hit that on the eighth.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.215
The goal for each practice
would definitely be

08:27.256 --> 08:30.676
to have everything
that we practice that week
set in stone.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.095
Everything needs to be
a hundred percent.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.223
We are preparing
to do what's right

08:35.264 --> 08:37.600
so you don't have to have
that mistake when you're there.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.060
I did this.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.561
Before Black Foxes,

08:40.603 --> 08:42.522
I was a modern dancer.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.981
so I did a lot of contemporary,

08:44.023 --> 08:44.941
I did a lot of lyrical,

08:44.982 --> 08:47.068
so transforming to this

08:47.109 --> 08:49.028
is like a whole
different universe.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.696
All right, y'all,
line back up, line back up.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.281
Last time.
I wanna see it again.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.450
Hammy: Me being
the Black Fox captain,

08:54.492 --> 08:56.369
I'm a no-nonsense
type of person.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.412
Jump is full out.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.623
I don't need foolishness
during my practice time.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.500
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

It is mandatory.

That's not from me,
that's from Doc.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.528
I just wanted to say that.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.238
Does anybody have
any questions, concerns?

Hammy: Last week
we did really good,

09:43.124 --> 09:44.917
but we know and PV fans know

09:44.959 --> 09:46.544
that we handed it to them.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.546
(whooping and cheering)

09:49.839 --> 09:51.465
But with that in mind,

09:51.507 --> 09:52.883
it was not our best.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.552
The first thing
I think about for us

09:54.594 --> 09:58.306
is ranking number one
in the ESPN Undefeated.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.516
Of course Prairie View's
the best, you know,
the Black Foxes, you know,

10:00.558 --> 10:01.309
you can't go wrong with them.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.853
I'm pretty sure we're gonna
do this dance for homecoming,

10:03.894 --> 10:05.730
so this is no joke.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.440
With that being said,

10:07.481 --> 10:09.233
Deshaun and I
this year are looking

10:09.275 --> 10:10.776
for new leadership
for next year.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.194
So if you want that spot,

10:12.236 --> 10:13.779
you need to show
you want that spot.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.823
So that means
leadership qualities,

10:15.865 --> 10:18.743
that means attitude,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

10:20.911 --> 10:24.081
I am definitely interested
being a captain.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.834
It's not just if I dance good.
It's not if I'm pretty.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.628
Everybody's pretty.
Everybody dances good.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.838
'Cause if you didn't dance good,
you wouldn't be a Fox.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.716
When it comes to
competition for a captain,

10:33.758 --> 10:35.676
it could be anybody really.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.514
(hip-hop music playing)

10:40.556 --> 10:42.767
To be a strong contender
for a captain,

10:42.808 --> 10:45.519
that person really
needs to go to sleep
thinking about Foxes

10:45.561 --> 10:47.146
and wake up
thinking about Foxes.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.148
To be dedicated
and here for the team,

10:49.190 --> 10:50.983
not just for the position
or the title.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.401
All right, guys. Hands in.

10:52.443 --> 10:56.364
-F-O, F-O!
-All: Ace, ace! Aye!

10:59.075 --> 11:03.788
("Icy" by Sharde playing)

11:16.384 --> 11:20.930
(uplifting
trumpet music playing)

11:27.561 --> 11:28.813
-(upbeat drumming)
-(indistinct chanting)

11:28.854 --> 11:30.189
My name is Nehemiah.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.109
I'm 20 years old.
I'm from Missouri City, Texas.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.902
It's not quite the hood,

11:34.944 --> 11:36.904
but it's low-key to hood.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.740
I'm glad that, you know,
band and music was in my life

11:39.782 --> 11:42.034
at a young age
to keep me focused.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.869
(indistinct chanting)

11:43.911 --> 11:45.496
I got into music
because of my father.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.289
Watching him
play guitar growing up,

11:47.331 --> 11:50.209
and watching
just the time he put into
perfecting his craft.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.669
Like, it was more than
a hobby to him.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.379
It was something
that he loved.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.171
(plays ending note)

11:54.171 --> 11:57.591
Let's go ahead, we're gonna
transit to the practice field

11:57.633 --> 11:59.510
for the Dancing Committee.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.970
We got five minutes,
let's go.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.935
(whistle blows)

12:07.977 --> 12:10.563
(hip-hop music playing)

12:12.106 --> 12:14.608
Woman: First up,
we go from the horn,

12:14.650 --> 12:16.444
all the way to the front line.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.029
The dance committee,
they're gonna walk
y'all through it.

12:19.947 --> 12:23.159
And down, up, turn, down.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.202
Up... All right.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.329
The Dance Routine Committee
is responsible

12:27.371 --> 12:28.664
for creating and teaching

12:28.706 --> 12:30.124
every dance
that you see on the field.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.668
Make sure your hips
got that "ahh"!

12:32.710 --> 12:35.087
Got that motion.
You feel me?

12:35.129 --> 12:37.047
It's kinda the chance
for the new generation

12:37.089 --> 12:37.757
to shine in our show.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.050
That's when we try
to play newer songs

12:40.092 --> 12:41.844
and do all these
new dance trends.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.137
I know it's fast,

12:43.179 --> 12:45.431
but you just gotta
swing that arm, swing it.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.516
But it has to be executed

12:47.558 --> 12:50.352
with just as much precision
as anything else that we do.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.439
Five, six, ready and... aah!

12:53.481 --> 12:56.692
(trumpet solo)

12:58.110 --> 13:00.529
I take Dance Routine Committee
very seriously.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.865
I really wanna try out
for drum major next year.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.367
And I need to be able to show

13:05.409 --> 13:07.912
that I can handle
some responsibility.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.789
Gotta go full out.

13:09.830 --> 13:10.664
-(trumpet plays)
-...if you're not full out.

13:10.706 --> 13:14.835
Some people don't understand
what full out really means.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.421
Oh-ho!

13:17.463 --> 13:18.130
If at the end of the routine,

13:18.130 --> 13:20.299
you not sweating,
tired out of breath,

13:20.341 --> 13:22.510
you're not doing it right.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.012
Go full out!
I will keep repeating this

13:25.054 --> 13:27.097
until I've seen
what I wanna see.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.432
Go full out!

13:28.474 --> 13:29.850
It's gonna take some hard work

13:29.892 --> 13:31.852
to get 'em right
before a homecoming,

13:31.894 --> 13:33.729
but we gonna be aight,
we gonna be aight.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.105
I'm just... (mumbles)

13:35.147 --> 13:37.691
I don't know. (laughs)

I personally think
that Nehemiah has the potential

13:47.701 --> 13:49.703
and exactly what it takes
to become

13:49.745 --> 13:51.330
another drum major
for the band.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.708
But at times,
he has a short fuse.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.378
Whoa! I'm not
gonna say this again!

13:57.419 --> 13:59.088

13:59.129 --> 14:01.131
Jalen: It deteriorates
the morale

14:01.173 --> 14:03.717
that the band has built
over the year.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.095
That's the only thing
hindering him back...

14:08.806 --> 14:09.473
to become a drum major.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.142
You have to learn
how to talk to people

14:12.184 --> 14:15.855
when you are the face of
a band of 300 to 400.

-I'm doin' good.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.670
My name is Cardavion Willie,

14:39.712 --> 14:41.922
I am 23 years old,

14:41.964 --> 14:44.675
and I play the euphonium
in the Marching Storm.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.218
What you got going?

14:46.260 --> 14:48.846
-Girl, I'm over here
making some cookies.
-Ooh, I see.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.056
I am a big entrepreneur.

14:51.098 --> 14:54.518
I have not one business,
but two businesses.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.853
I have my food business.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.272
I make home-cooked meals,

14:58.314 --> 15:01.066
I bake cakes,
you know, et cetera,

15:01.108 --> 15:03.360
and then I sell hair, lashes,

15:03.402 --> 15:05.779
do-rags, bonnets,
the whole nine yards.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.573
You can really call me
an all-in-one.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.824
You know,
I got kicked outta band,

15:08.866 --> 15:09.867
so this is just like a--

15:09.909 --> 15:11.577
Wait, you can't just...

15:11.619 --> 15:13.787
run past that
like you ain't just say that.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.789
You... you got
kicked outta band?

15:15.831 --> 15:18.417
Yes, honey, I had a little...
a small altercation.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.669
What got me
kicked out of band was

15:20.711 --> 15:21.629
me and Martayvia,

15:21.670 --> 15:23.589
we had a altercation.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.299
It wasn't really that deep,

15:25.341 --> 15:27.593
but this is how
all the drama started.

15:27.635 --> 15:31.180
I was in a friend group with
like seven of us and Martayvia.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.265
And with them,
you know, I text 'em,

15:33.307 --> 15:35.309
"Hey, what's up, y'all?
Y'all trying to chill?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.477
"You know, y'all wanna
come watch TV,

15:36.518 --> 15:37.937
watch a movie, play some games?"

15:37.978 --> 15:39.188
I won't get a response.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.398
I'll be like, "Okay, y'all,
I'm cooking."

15:41.440 --> 15:43.734
They knocking on the door.
"Hey, friend."

15:43.776 --> 15:45.361
And I'm just like, "Okay..."

15:45.402 --> 15:46.695
Who wants friends like that

15:46.737 --> 15:48.280
that just come
to your house to eat

15:48.322 --> 15:50.032
and don't wanna, you know,

15:50.074 --> 15:51.700
chill with you
on a regular basis?

15:51.742 --> 15:55.120
So this is just like a little
apology to my section,

15:55.162 --> 15:56.580
and I don't give apologies,
just, you know,

15:56.622 --> 15:58.123
so I can get back
on people's good side.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.708
So you hoping
these cookies are gonna

15:59.750 --> 16:01.627
get you back in the band?

16:01.669 --> 16:02.878
I'm hoping.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.463
You know,
this is my last season,

16:04.505 --> 16:06.715
I was just tryin' to,
you know, go out
with a bang, but.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.468
Go out with a bang, all right.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.138
Cardavion:
College has not been
peaches and cream.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.183
They'll see me in public
with my hair and my makeup done,

16:16.225 --> 16:18.686
they'll be like, "Ugh, is that
a boy or is that a girl?"

16:18.727 --> 16:19.603
Both of 'em.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.229
If you see me

16:20.229 --> 16:20.896
with my hair
and my lashes done

16:20.896 --> 16:23.857
and my makeup,
me dressed like a girl,

16:23.899 --> 16:26.735
then you should call me,
you know, she or her.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.279
But if you see me
dressed like a boy

16:29.321 --> 16:30.781
with basketball shorts on,

16:30.823 --> 16:33.200
my hair just in
a puff or ponytail,

16:33.242 --> 16:36.620
then, you know, you can
call me a boy, him, bro.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.789
You should call me
what I look like.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.624
Well, I know
you probably don't know,

16:40.666 --> 16:42.918
but like my freshman year,
Doc actually told me

16:42.960 --> 16:45.629
that I couldn't go to
Macy's Day Parade in New York.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.339
And I had to talk to him.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.841
Like, I was like
really confused,

16:48.882 --> 16:50.300
like, "Doc, like,
am I clear to go?"

16:50.342 --> 16:52.094
And he straight-up told me,
"No, you cannot go."

16:52.136 --> 16:53.429
Why?

16:53.470 --> 16:55.014
I just kinda
was missing practice.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.849
You know how they was
about missing practice.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.768
-Well--
-But I did talk to him
and he made me,

16:59.810 --> 17:01.770
um, just express to him
what I did wrong.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.230
Did I learn from the situation?

17:03.272 --> 17:04.523
And he let me go to New York.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.025
So maybe if you
just talk to him,

17:06.066 --> 17:08.027
express what you feel like
you've done wrong

17:08.068 --> 17:09.570
or have you learned
from the situation.

17:09.611 --> 17:10.904
He might let you come back.

17:10.946 --> 17:11.989
Imma try not to, girl,

17:12.031 --> 17:13.365
but, you know,
it just be hard.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.742
Imma go there
with good intentions,

17:14.783 --> 17:16.076
you know,
bringing the cookies,

17:16.118 --> 17:17.703
and hopefully
everything goes good.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.580
Okay. If it don't work out,

17:19.621 --> 17:21.749
what's your,
what's the next plan?

17:21.790 --> 17:23.542
Don't go cussing 'em people out.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.085
Don't knock no... Don't...

17:25.127 --> 17:26.879
-The plan is to talk to the Doc.
-Okay.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.088
Hopefully he's at his office.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.674
If he's not
at his office, then...

17:30.716 --> 17:33.052
Imma pass, still pass out them
some cookies though, you know.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.846
I sacrificed
my college life for band.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.264
When it comes to band,

17:37.306 --> 17:39.391
you can't join
different organizations,

17:39.433 --> 17:40.893
like different clubs.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.145
You can't attend
like different parties

17:43.187 --> 17:44.563
because you're at band practice.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.231
You have band, band, band.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.483
Doctor's like, he should...

17:47.524 --> 17:49.193
You know, he should
let me back in the band.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.195
And even if they
don't take your cookie,

17:51.236 --> 17:52.237
be a bigger person.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.530
You know, maybe apologize.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.534
-(both laugh)
-You're stupid.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.078
Maybe. Think about it.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.829
If you feel like there's
a part that you played in this,

18:00.871 --> 18:02.289
I think you should
just own up to it,

18:02.331 --> 18:05.209
and you never know
where you might end up.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.794
-Well--
-And that's gonna be hard.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.212
Well, but I don't think

18:08.253 --> 18:10.255
I did anything wrong
to apologize, you know.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.508
Nothing... You didn't do
nothing wrong?

18:13.050 --> 18:14.218
Nothin'?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.805
I'm trying to think.
I didn't do nothin'.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.380
I'm the third,
so everybody call me Tre.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.633
And my current section
in the Marching Storm
is bass drum.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.095
You can hear us
from down the street

18:58.137 --> 19:00.681
or in Houston.
(laughs)

19:00.722 --> 19:03.433
Man (over PA):
All right, the next section,
the trombones.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.184
Trombones,
I need you to get together

19:04.184 --> 19:06.562
and I need you to make this
have some soul.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.356
I'm a father,
and my baby, Arianna,

19:09.398 --> 19:11.441
she's three months old.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.277
It's a blessing.
She's beautiful.

19:13.318 --> 19:13.944
She makes me happy.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.196
My favorite thing
about being a dad

19:16.238 --> 19:18.657
is the way her face lights up

19:18.699 --> 19:19.741
when I walk in the room.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.243
Makes me feel something

19:21.285 --> 19:23.328
that I've never felt before.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.038
Martayvia: How have
everything been,

19:25.080 --> 19:26.665
you, Lamonica, the baby?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.208
I know y'all be stressed out.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.877
If y'all need a break,
y'all know I can watch her.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.421
Yeah, you know,
Imma hit you up regardless.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.673
I rather have you watch her
than anybody, really.

19:34.715 --> 19:38.135
Me too, 'cause I hate to have
to bop-bop somebody...

19:38.177 --> 19:40.679
For real.
I ain't playin'.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.598
I am Martayvia Patterson.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.349
I am a senior education major,

19:44.391 --> 19:46.226
and I'm
the piccolo section leader.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.646
Me and Tay definitely have
a brother-sister relationship.

19:49.688 --> 19:53.609
First time I met Tay, we got
into it, straight argument.

19:53.650 --> 19:54.193
I was like,

19:54.234 --> 19:56.153
"Man, you talkin' like
you from Dallas."

19:56.195 --> 19:57.821
She was like, "You talkin'
like you from Dallas."

19:57.863 --> 19:59.281
I was like,
"Well, I'm from Dallas."

19:59.323 --> 20:01.325
She said,
"Well, I'm from Dallas too."

20:01.366 --> 20:02.492
I was like, "Okay.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.786
We cool then."

20:04.828 --> 20:06.121
Yeah, I'm just nervous

20:06.163 --> 20:08.707
because, you know,
I ain't have...

20:08.749 --> 20:12.377
the... that person in my life

20:12.419 --> 20:15.255
and I'm finna be
that person to somebody.

20:15.297 --> 20:18.050
So it's just like,
it's different.

20:18.091 --> 20:21.178
But, you know, you know how
it feels to not have somebody.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.472
Your goal is to...
for your child

20:23.513 --> 20:25.098
to have a better life
than you got.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.266
Oh, yeah, for sure.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.393
She already got
a better life than me.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.520
All this stuff she got
in my house.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.814
What's up with you?
What's been going on with you?

20:32.856 --> 20:34.816
-I'm not in band no more.
-Yeah.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.110
I haven't seen you.
What happened there?

20:37.152 --> 20:40.822
Man, so, you know,
at Labor Day Classic,

20:40.864 --> 20:43.742
Cardavion was talking this,
talking this, talking this.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.369
I just had to
say something to him

20:45.410 --> 20:46.912
'cause I was really over it.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.497
It was really--

20:48.538 --> 20:51.208
What, like, what started
the mess though?

20:51.250 --> 20:54.169
We been already having words
because he said

20:54.211 --> 20:56.755
that we only wanna
come to his house
when we wanna eat,

20:56.797 --> 20:58.173
so basically he cut us off.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.384
You know, it's only so much
somebody can take.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.886
So then we was
really finna get into it.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.805
It took my section
to hold me back.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.348
-So that day...
-Mm-hmm.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.933
...he was really actin' scary.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.102
So I hit his phone,
like voice messages.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.436
-I'm like... I'm like...
-Tre: Shit!

21:11.478 --> 21:13.605
-Ohh!
-Yeah. "You got me
messed up."

21:13.647 --> 21:15.190
(indistinct)

21:15.232 --> 21:17.609
Then I got a email
from Student Code of Conduct

21:17.651 --> 21:19.569
talkin' about somethin'
I'm cyberbullying.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.737
-That's not smart though.
-Martayvia: It's not.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.531
It-it wasn't smart. It wasn't.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.533
It wasn't smart but I was mad.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.077
-I don't care.
-You know how people
get when they mad.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.371
I understand how mad
you was, but you can
say that in person.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.456
It's not cyberbullying
if you say it in person.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.500
-Exactly. So that... So that...
-(laughing)

21:33.542 --> 21:34.876
Then I went to Doc.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.169
I'm just cooling it,

21:36.211 --> 21:38.046
trying to see if I can
get back in band.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.299
All I gotta say is, you know,
find a mediator.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.843
You know, y'all have to
deal with this some type of way.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.261
We don't have to
deal with nothing.

21:44.303 --> 21:48.432
But that's not
the adult way, Tay.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.351
You gotta stop doing that.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.436
"You gotta stop doing that."

21:52.477 --> 21:53.603
Tre: You got to.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.022
-No, I don't.
-Tre: Yes, you do.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.274
-Mm-mmm.
-Have you like
explained the situation

21:57.316 --> 21:59.234
like you just explained
it to me to Dr. Zach?

21:59.276 --> 21:59.985
No.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.739
Tre: Knowing Dr. Zach
and knowing how he is,

22:03.780 --> 22:05.699
you have to put
that foot forward

22:05.741 --> 22:07.075
and you have to show him

22:07.117 --> 22:09.703
that you want to be
back in the band.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.370
See what he has to say.

22:10.412 --> 22:14.082
♪ Feelin' like a man,
like a man ♪

22:14.124 --> 22:15.917
♪ Feelin' like a man ♪

22:19.129 --> 22:21.423
(hip-hop music playing)

22:22.799 --> 22:25.844
(indistinct chatter)

22:29.056 --> 22:31.725
-Woman: Okay, thank you.
-Cardavion: You're welcome.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.187
Today I went to Holdsworth
to pass out cookies to everyone,

22:35.228 --> 22:37.314
you know, just
to be a good person,

22:37.356 --> 22:38.315
a good...

22:38.357 --> 22:39.816
What's that word called?

22:39.858 --> 22:41.318
Not a good deed.
A good...

22:41.360 --> 22:43.195
It's like when you're trying
to do something good...

22:43.236 --> 22:45.530
-Producer: Samaritan?
-Yeah, a good Samaritan.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.823
Thank you.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.537
(indistinct chatter)

22:55.707 --> 22:58.126
Man: Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.796
Me baking the cookies
wasn't really an apology.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.673
It was just for like me to get
on Dr. Zach's good side.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.467
So, Dr. Zach, he should,

23:05.509 --> 23:07.427
you know, he should
let me back in the band.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.810
(fast-paced march music playing)

23:14.851 --> 23:16.436
...everybody.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.480
(indistinct)
March!

23:18.522 --> 23:20.857
We will march
this entire parking lot
until tomorrow.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.984
March! March!

23:23.026 --> 23:25.612
Homecomin'. What does that mean
for the Marching Storm?

23:25.654 --> 23:27.572
Work. That's what that means.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.283
It's one of the most
grueling weeks,

23:30.325 --> 23:32.994
because we wanna make sure
that we put on a show

23:33.036 --> 23:35.831
that's going to resonate
with the alumnus.

23:35.872 --> 23:39.543
Being ranked number eight
by Undefeated right now

23:39.584 --> 23:41.962
makes me wanna go even harder.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.047
'Cause I'm not
a number eight type of guy.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.382
I'm not a number two
type of guy.

23:45.424 --> 23:49.469
(fast-paced march band music
playing)

24:04.734 --> 24:07.904
(pop song playing)

24:17.873 --> 24:19.624
Hammy:
Practice was long today.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.126
It was good though.
We needed that.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.295
This your last homecoming.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.088
Oh, don't tell me that.
I'm gonna cry!

24:25.130 --> 24:26.798
How you feelin'?

24:26.840 --> 24:29.134
For it to be
my last homecoming, I feel good.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.511
I'm-I'm excited.
I'm a senior finna graduate.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.389
I just, I just don't
want it to end.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.016
I don't want the moment
to go past

24:36.057 --> 24:38.310
and to, like, dang,
that's my homecoming.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.145
-My first homecoming.
-(laughs)

24:40.187 --> 24:43.899
-How you feelin'?
-I'm lit!

24:43.940 --> 24:46.276
-This being
my first homecoming...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.069
It's-it's gonna be a lot.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.071
Especially with it
being the 50th,

24:50.113 --> 24:52.199
and the first year come back
from COVID.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.242
We didn't have
homecoming last year.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.161
It's very surreal

24:56.203 --> 24:58.538
that four years
have gone by this fast.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.624
It sucks that last year
homecoming was canceled

25:00.665 --> 25:02.584
because of COVID and, you know,

25:02.626 --> 25:03.919
the restrictions and everything.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.379
But I'm gonna try
to make this year special,

25:06.421 --> 25:08.423
especially me being captain,

25:08.465 --> 25:10.592
I'm gonna make sure
I put in all the hard work

25:10.634 --> 25:12.260
that I need to
to make it memorable,

25:12.302 --> 25:14.054
not just for me
but for my team.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.555
I'm excited. I'm ready.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.641
Especially having
legacy Foxes there,

25:17.682 --> 25:19.392
it feels like lookin' 'em
in the eye, like,

25:19.434 --> 25:21.144
I'm continuing
what you paved for me.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.103
-Yeah.
-So...

25:22.145 --> 25:23.355
And I love my legacy Foxes.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.023
I love what they set for us,

25:25.065 --> 25:27.192
the-the legacy
that they set for us.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.862
-Definitely.
-But this is 2021.
It's something new.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.490
This homecoming is special
for the Black Foxes

25:33.532 --> 25:35.909
because it is our
50th year anniversary.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.498
With the legacy Black Foxes
coming back,

25:41.540 --> 25:44.876
it is kind of, you know,
nerve-racking a little bit.

25:44.918 --> 25:48.213
It does humble us
as current Black Foxes

25:48.255 --> 25:49.965
because this is
their organization.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.551
This is their legacy
that they left behind.

25:52.592 --> 25:55.637
Whoever's coming up next,
got some big shoes to fill

25:55.679 --> 25:59.391
because with
everything going on right now,

25:59.432 --> 26:00.934
COVID, we not really to do...

26:00.976 --> 26:03.520
We're not really able to do
all the games next year.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.230
Y'all are doing everything
and then ten more.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.024
That's-that's a lot.
That's a lot.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.527
That's a big, big shoes to fill.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.279
I definitely feel like any of us
could step up.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.573
Anybody. You know
what you got to work on, though.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.866
These.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.785
-Gah! (laughs)
-You gotta work on that.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.579
You love to snap back.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.622
-It'd be funny--
-Not really though.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.667
Snap back? Me?

26:25.709 --> 26:27.711
Maybe because I've been
around you for like a long time,

26:27.752 --> 26:29.212
I just know what
you're gonna say next.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.506
I look at your face
and you'll be like, "Ugh!"

26:31.548 --> 26:35.093
I'll be like,
"No, it's not funny.
You cannot say that."

26:35.135 --> 26:37.220
Like half the stuff
you want to say,
I wanna say it too.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.139
But if you in that
leadership position,
you can't say it.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.265
All right.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.100
If I were to be
captain next year,

26:42.142 --> 26:45.854
I definitely feel like I will
bring a new side of Foxes.

26:45.895 --> 26:48.773
I feel as though
I'm very confident

26:48.815 --> 26:50.400
and I'm very, like...

26:50.442 --> 26:52.527
I don't wanna say cocky,
but I just,

26:52.569 --> 26:53.612
I know what I'm talking about.

26:53.653 --> 26:55.280
And I can see a bigger vision

26:55.322 --> 26:56.948
and a bigger picture, so...

26:56.990 --> 26:58.658
So I definitely feel like
I could add

26:58.700 --> 27:02.370
a lot of oomph and flavor
to the team.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.080
If I can't look at you
as a friend,

27:04.122 --> 27:05.665
and I'll just look at you
as a leader,

27:05.707 --> 27:07.792
it's like, Imma, Imma have...

27:07.834 --> 27:09.669
what I need to say
or what I need to do.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.087
I see what you're saying,

27:11.129 --> 27:13.131
but friendships cut off

27:13.173 --> 27:14.674
when it's 5:30 here.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.551
With Marching Storm
moving so fast-paced,

27:16.593 --> 27:18.053
we ain't got time
for friendships.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.680
But with them understanding
that I am a leader...

27:20.722 --> 27:22.515
-Mm-hmm.
-...it takes two.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.351
I res... If I'm
giving out respect,

27:24.392 --> 27:26.019
-that's what needs to happen.
-Mm-hmm.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.896
Now, I'm not saying that you
don't give out respect...

27:27.937 --> 27:29.356
Mm-hmm.

27:29.397 --> 27:31.983
-...but you do have your days.
-I do.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.610
Before practice even started...

27:33.652 --> 27:35.904
-I knew.
-...when you come in
it's just like, "Ugh, Hammy,

Hey, hey. Quick. Come on.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.255
Um, so this next week,
y'all know it's homecoming.

36:56.297 --> 36:59.842
We got a long three-mile
parade ahead of us...

36:59.884 --> 37:01.177
in the freezing cold.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.637
Wait, it's in the morning?

37:02.678 --> 37:04.388
Yeah, like, seven o'clock
in the morning.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.598
Seven o'clock?

37:05.640 --> 37:07.266
Nobody's gonna be here.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.227
Oh, no, people
are gonna be here.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.603
It's gonna be packed for sure.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.105
We have a parade coming up,
we have the game,

37:13.147 --> 37:14.982
we have special performances
coming up.

37:15.024 --> 37:18.069
It's really hectic trying to get
everything all together

37:18.110 --> 37:19.987
for homecoming week
coming up.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.657
Next week no spot is guaranteed.
You already know that.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.867
Dance also, even marches.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.535
That's why
we practicin' now.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.913
Get your stuff together.
That's all I can say about that.

37:28.955 --> 37:32.124
We usually start off rehearsals
being in our sectionals.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.626
So the Foxes would be
at the Foxes,

37:33.668 --> 37:34.293
the clarinets would be
at the clarinets,

37:34.335 --> 37:36.295
the trumpets would be
at the trumpets,

37:36.337 --> 37:37.797
so we'll be separated.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.008
Then we'll all come together

37:41.050 --> 37:43.469
and it's like
a big, hectic family reunion.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.471
If there's mistakes,
we go over those mistakes

37:45.513 --> 37:46.681

and over again,

37:46.722 --> 37:47.807

we just give off big energy.
