WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:06.422
Hey. Thanks.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.383
No, no, no... Here.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.344
You got this whole thing
wrong, Em.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.513
It's the rock star that's
supposed to be late,

00:13.639 --> 00:14.889
not the rock-star photographer.

00:15.224 --> 00:18.184
Sorry. Morning sickness.
Touch the belly.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.603
It's the first time
I've been asked to do that.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.063
Come on. It's good luck.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.773
Okay.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.567
Hit the Kinos behind the drop.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.658
So what do you think?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.452
I think people
aren't gonna get it.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.830
Come on.
"All-American Rejects."

00:38.956 --> 00:43.543
Juxtaposing a classic image of Americana
with modern pop culture youth.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.920
Oh, yeah.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.256
Everyone loves
a good juxtaposition.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.966
My fans were born in the '90s.

00:50.092 --> 00:53.761
You know what? You do this picture,
you'll gain 40 years of fans.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.388
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.890
- I love the Rockwell thing.
- I thought so.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.852
Okay. Kill the house lights.
Let's go!

01:07.651 --> 01:09.861
Hang on. Hey, who's in charge
of the backdrop?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.696
- Naomi?
- Yeah?

01:12.156 --> 01:13.781
What's wrong with it?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.367
Well, the words are
completely jumbled.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.662
What, you can read that?

01:20.122 --> 01:21.748
Of course.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.375
- You okay?
- No. Oh, God.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.461
I could be having a...

01:27.004 --> 01:29.005
What's the mnemonic?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.842
"F" is for face.
Is my smile crooked?

01:34.011 --> 01:35.261
What are you doing?

01:35.387 --> 01:37.889
"A" is for arms.

01:38.015 --> 01:38.848
Arms.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.349
You should really sit down.

01:40.476 --> 01:41.809
Can someone
get her some water?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.519
"S" is speech.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.396
I'm slurring? I'm slurring?

01:49.193 --> 01:51.194
"F-A-S-T."

01:51.862 --> 01:53.446
"T" is for time.

01:53.572 --> 01:58.159
Hurry. Somebody, call 911.
Tell them I'm having a stroke.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.036
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.038
My boss says you're important.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.957
Personally I don't get
what's so hard about

02:46.083 --> 02:48.000
making Scarlett Johansson
look pretty.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.710
Arms out in front of you.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.879
Palms up like
you're holding a pizza.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.798
Close your eyes.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.344
It's so easy you should
consider a career change.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.846
Probably make
a lot more money.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.807
Dr. Mackman tell you
the clot was clear?

03:02.933 --> 03:03.891
Yes.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.143
And he said that you
and the fetus are fine?

03:06.270 --> 03:07.395
Yeah.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.106
He didn't mention
your pronator drift?

03:10.732 --> 03:14.193
- What's that mean?
- Means Mackman is an idiot.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.195
- May I?
- Yeah.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.072
So,

03:19.032 --> 03:21.409
you take thousands
of photos of someone,

03:21.535 --> 03:23.870
but only one has to look good.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.079
Kind of the opposite
of my business.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.664
It's not about looking good.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.874
People are always
hiding things.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.294
I just keep shooting until I can see
what's really inside them.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.672
- My eyes okay?
- Eyes are gorgeous.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.674
The vessels don't look so hot.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.635
Microaneurysms predict
further strokes.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.595
This is gonna happen again?

03:40.804 --> 03:43.431
Unless I can figure out
the underlying cause.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.224
Puff up your cheeks.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.396
You should be able to keep the air in.
Means there's weakness around the mouth.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.273
So where'd you learn
to self-diagnose a stroke?

03:52.399 --> 03:56.777
Oh, my baby's biological
father is a neurologist.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.531
He once told me the FAST mnemonic
could save my life one day. So...

04:00.824 --> 04:02.491
Interesting pet name.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.411
Most people go with
"husband" or "pookie."

04:05.829 --> 04:07.538
He's gay.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.373
Just a sperm donor.
So when you...

04:09.499 --> 04:11.125
You turned him
for a night?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.919
Just straight for one date?

04:13.670 --> 04:14.837
Okay.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.841
He took a magazine and a cup
into my bathroom.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.760
A man after my own heart.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.720
Different magazine obviously.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.890
I'm rescinding Mackman's
discharge order.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.892
My lackeys will be in
to do some tests,

04:28.018 --> 04:30.895
take some more blood
and empty your catheter bag.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.654
Not a moment you'll
want to cherish.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.784
This is definitely different.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.078
It looks almost like...

04:47.287 --> 04:48.955
He's caring.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.381
Find anything else in the patient's
folder? Like a diagnosis?

04:58.507 --> 05:01.968
Urinalysis revealed excessive protein
and red blood cells.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.720
Chem panel showed
a creatinine level over 2.5.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.265
So first she strokes,
now her kidneys are shutting down. Why?

05:08.392 --> 05:10.142
Ultrasound showed
no tumors or stones.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.895
No signs of fetal distress.
No urinary tract obstructions.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.855
BP is fine. No pre-eclampsia.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.149
Any of you guys
ever been to the GalÃ¡pagos?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.609
Was our patient there?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.736
Dengue fever, avian pox,
even West Nile.

05:20.862 --> 05:21.946
No.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.614
I'm looking for
a vacation spot.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.949
That mean we get vacation?

05:25.075 --> 05:27.535
How would that differ
from your current status?

05:27.661 --> 05:28.995
You're gonna do what? Relax?

05:29.121 --> 05:30.121
Visiting family.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.664
My uncle's a giant turtle.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.541
What if the kidney failure
came first?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.043
Kidneys could've caused the stroke,
not the other way around.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.170
Kidneys don't often
get stuck in the brain.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.672
I'm saying it threw a clot.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.550
Early symptoms of kidney failure are
nausea, vomiting, ankle swelling.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.385
She would've mistaken it
for morning sickness.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.637
Heart's way more likely
to throw a clot than a kidney.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.890
Echo was normal. The history indicates
no sign of cardiac problems.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.184
No, but if one were to read
the history closely,

05:52.310 --> 05:54.603
one would notice that she had six cases
of strep.

05:54.730 --> 05:57.523
In her throat. That's the one about
10 inches above her heart.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.401
Let me rephrase,
six cases of untreated strep.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.819
She was
prescribed antibiotics.

06:01.945 --> 06:02.987
No one takes them all.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.449
They stop when they start feeling
better. All strep is untreated strep.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.867
What happens when
strep goes untreated?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.326
Leads to rheumatic fever.

06:09.578 --> 06:10.619
Which leads to... Cameron?

06:10.829 --> 06:11.996
Mitral valve stenosis.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.082
Which is a thickening
in the valve of the... Kidney?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.292
No.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.877
The kidney doesn't have
a mitral valve.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.087
We'll go look at her heart.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.090
Be easy to find.

06:23.425 --> 06:27.094
It's the big red pumping thing
about 10 inches below her throat.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.138
That was weird.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.808
- He was the way he always is.
- Which is weird.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.062
- Very still, Emma.
- Sorry.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.229
No problem.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.566
He caught us with your hand up my shirt.
He's gotta have a reaction to that.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.984
You think that's what
the vacation is?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.110
Yes.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.781
The pain of losing you
is obviously forcing him away.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.115
Coronal slice appears normal.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.409
There's no way House
just lets this slide.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.786
He's gotta be
planning something.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.996
Maybe he just
doesn't give a crap.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.414
Sagittal slice is clean.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.999
You think he just
stumbled into that closet?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.376
He knew we were there
and he wanted us to know that he knew.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.128
Or you wanted him to know.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.381
Now he does and you're annoyed
because he doesn't care.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.549
Right there.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.427
Trans-axial slice.
Calcified mitral valve.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.721
Barely. That's not big enough
to throw a clot.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.182
Obviously it is,
because it did.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.725
House was right.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.853
A valve in your heart
is narrowed.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.648
It caused the clot
which lead to your stroke,

07:20.774 --> 07:24.443
and the reduced circulation
caused the problem with your kidneys.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.070
And this will fix it?

07:26.196 --> 07:29.573
The balloon will force the valve back
open and you'll be fine.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.158
Can we do this
without a sedative?

07:31.284 --> 07:34.203
It's very mild. There really is no risk
to the fetus.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.539
We'll monitor your baby's
heart rate separately.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.376
We won't allow it to
decrease anywhere near dangerous levels.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.547
Thank you.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.756
You're both gonna be fine.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.052
Go ahead, Dr. Cameron.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.099
Listen to that heartbeat.
It sounds so...

07:56.560 --> 07:58.686
Start threading the catheter.

08:05.694 --> 08:10.656
No, I don't want a layover in Frankfurt,
Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.825
That's why I asked
for a direct flight to Phnom Penh.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.495
How hard is it to not land?
Does it matter what I answer?

08:16.872 --> 08:19.123
Well, then fine.
I'd be delighted to hold.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.292
- What's new?
- Can Cuddy stop interfering?

08:21.418 --> 08:22.668
It's her job. What's new?

08:22.794 --> 08:24.044
Good news is
Emma's heart is fixed.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.548
Bad news is it's not her underlying
problem. Her kidneys are still failing.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.592
You're vacationing
in Cambodia?

08:29.718 --> 08:30.843
You gonna unwind in the Killing
Fields?

08:30.969 --> 08:31.802
Nope.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.596
Gonna catch me
a fish this big.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.098
Mekong giant catfish.
Weighs over 600 pounds.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.600
Aren't those catfish
critically endangered?

08:37.726 --> 08:39.560
That's why it's my last chance
to catch one.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.020
All of our operators
are currently...

08:41.229 --> 08:42.688
If the mitral valve had been properly
fixed

08:42.814 --> 08:43.981
the kidney should be getting better,

08:44.107 --> 08:46.567
which leads us to the conclusion that
you screwed up the procedure.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.110
Or you screwed up
the diagnosis.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.820
The mitral valve thickening
was so insignificant

08:49.946 --> 08:52.072
it probably wasn't the cause
of the kidneys or the stroke.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.449
Probably never would've
been a problem.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.826
She needs dialysis
and we need a new theory.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.953
There are only
a few possibilities.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.247
Patient's pregnant,
could be pre-eclampsia.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.749
We eliminated it
before because...

09:01.875 --> 09:04.084
Re-check for proteinuria
and low platelets. What else?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.294
Hypoperfusion.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.631
The fetus is basically a parasite
stealing nutrients, minerals, blood.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.840
Put her on telemetry.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.300
Or the pregnancy
is irrelevant.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.053
Could be infection,
sepsis, HUS/TTP.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.138
A cholesterol embolism
is just as likely.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.725
Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down,
clog up small vessels of the kidneys.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.810
Get a smear and ultrasound
her vessels for plaque.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.729
That's it.
Has to be one of those five.

09:23.855 --> 09:27.858
You know what would be even better? If
we'd narrow it all the way down to one.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.819
Thank you for holding.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.405
We are experiencing
extremely high call volume.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.658
Thank you for your patience.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.623
She's 0 for five.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.128
Either the differential
was wrong or she's faking it.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.464
Kidney failure has to be
precipitated by...

09:50.590 --> 09:51.882
One of the five
we've already ruled out.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.635
The body only has so many ways
of screwing with the kidneys.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.220
- The labs must be wrong.
- We did the labs.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.846
No one else had access.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.598
That's not quite true.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.484
You put all your patients through this
many tests or just the important ones?

10:11.778 --> 10:14.989
We wanted to explore
all possibilities.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.659
And?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.704
We've eliminated
all the possibilities.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.706
You telling me I'm dying
and you have no idea why?

10:23.915 --> 10:25.916
Your body is
functioning properly.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.501
So why are my kidneys failing?

10:29.671 --> 10:31.380
The other body isn't.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.301
There's something wrong
with the fetus.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.397
Welcome to the world
of maternal mirror syndrome.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.442
Mom's body is like

10:52.402 --> 10:54.737
an intricate
German metro system.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.363
All the trains run on time.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.868
When she gets pregnant, it's like a new
station opening in DÃ¼sseldorf.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.829
Bunch or rookies running things.
Bound to be mistakes.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.998
Kids play on the tracks,
get electrocuted.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.625
Before you know it, the trains are
backed up all the way to Berlin

11:08.752 --> 11:10.836
and you've got a bunch of angry Germans
with nowhere to go.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.755
And we all know
that ain't good for the Jews.

11:12.881 --> 11:13.922
Who are the Jews
in this metaphor?

11:14.049 --> 11:15.966
A few things can happen
to a fetus in distress.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.385
It can become a miscarriage,
stillbirth,

11:18.511 --> 11:21.805
a very sick baby
or on rare occasion a time bomb

11:22.057 --> 11:23.891
that kills mom
while it's dying.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.061
Good news is,
we fix the fetus, mom gets better.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.271
It's the diagnostic equivalent
of a two-for-one sale.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.483
I have read the outcome of mirror
syndrome is almost always unfavorable.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.611
"Unfavorable."
Is that doctor speak for "dead baby"?

11:35.987 --> 11:38.405
You think she'll be less upset
if you phrase it nicely?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.616
We can tell her the truth,
that she'll be fine

11:40.867 --> 11:44.286
as soon as we diagnose
a person who weighs about one pound.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.915
Can't touch it,
can't ask where it hurts, can't see it.

11:48.166 --> 11:52.044
If only there existed giant machines
that could look through human skin.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.546
Mirror syndrome
has a limited number of known causes.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.758
Tachyarrhythmia, fetal anemia,
placental chorioangioma.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.843
All of which are fixable.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.887
Which would be
un-unfavorable, right?

12:02.013 --> 12:03.764
Could also be trisomy 13.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.600
Ebstein's anomaly,
an aneurysm of Galen's vein.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.229
And Dr. Storm Cloud
rained all over the differential

12:10.355 --> 12:12.106
and killed
the beautiful little baby.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.442
Heart's easiest to see,
easiest to fix. So let's start there.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.945
When you did Mom's MRI,
did you get a look at the fetus's heart?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.532
It was in the range but blurry. The
fetus was moving all over the place.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.367
- So we need another scan.
- Yeah.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.036
We'll just ask the fetus
to lie very, very still.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.081
No need. I'm going to
paralyze it.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.002
You wanna paralyze
Emma Sloan's baby?

12:34.546 --> 12:36.088
Let me guess. Cameron?

12:36.214 --> 12:38.257
Cameron and Chase
both had their concerns.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.925
No, Cameron had concerns.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.093
Chase just agreed with her

12:41.219 --> 12:44.179
because he didn't want to lose
his all-access pass to her love rug.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.597
They're sleeping together?

12:45.723 --> 12:49.017
If by "sleeping together" you mean
having sex in the janitor's closet.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.018
Here?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.813
No, the janitor's closet
at the local high school.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.648
Go, Tiger Cats!

12:55.066 --> 12:57.693
Do you have one of those camera phones?
'Cause I got a MySpace account.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.903
I will deal with them
after I deal with you.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.530
Oh, come on.
Let's gossip some more.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.282
I'm sure she's into bondage.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.826
Paralyzing a one-pound baby
risks damaging...

13:05.952 --> 13:09.204
Not paralyzing the thing risks not
getting a clean MRI of its heart,

13:09.330 --> 13:13.250
which we need to save its life, which we
need to do to save Emma's life.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.335
You're gonna need to
get her consent.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.129
Well, that shouldn't be
too hard.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.256
"Sign here or you
and your baby both die."

13:21.009 --> 13:22.634
I'm going with you.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.013
Oh, good.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.641
You said sedation was risky.
This sounds insane.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.686
The injection goes into
the umbilical cord.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.979
The baby won't feel a thing.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.856
Fetus.

13:36.733 --> 13:40.652
I'm lowering expectations.
It works here and on dates.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.279
The benefits outweigh
the risks

13:42.405 --> 13:45.115
and the paralytic will
wear off in an hour, okay?

13:45.909 --> 13:49.411
Must be easier to hear
you might die than your baby might die.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.831
But if there's anyone
I would trust to save my baby,

13:53.791 --> 13:55.542
it would be Dr. House.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.215
Fetus.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.218
Hold this.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.498
Dr. Cameron.
The MRI results back?

14:34.624 --> 14:35.999
The fetus's heart
is structurally sound.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.293
The problem's with the bladder.
It's four times normal size.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.378
Let me see.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.421
The bladder's so engorged
it's taking up the whole torso,

14:41.548 --> 14:42.839
squeezing
all the other organs.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.174
There's no room
for the lungs to develop.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.343
The baby has a lower
urinary tract obstruction.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.844
We can fix that
by inserting a shunt.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.304
I'll give Emma the news.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.181
Are you taking over the case?

14:51.307 --> 14:53.308
House won't care.
He has his diagnosis.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.020
Doctor Cameron.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.858
Dating Chase can only end
in one of two ways.

15:01.985 --> 15:02.985
House told you?

15:03.111 --> 15:05.487
You get married
and live happily ever after,

15:05.613 --> 15:08.323
or somebody gets hurt
and you two can't work together,

15:08.449 --> 15:09.825
and I have to fire somebody.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.910
I would hate to see my personal life
become such a burden to you.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.078
I'm telling you this
for your own good.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.122
I assume you're gonna have this same
conversation with Chase

15:15.248 --> 15:16.081
for his own good.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.709
Chase isn't the one
that's gonna get hurt here.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.644
There's only room for one
but I could scooch over.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.271
My social life
is my social life.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.023
Couldn't agree more.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.525
What goes on in the privacy of a
janitor's closet

15:43.651 --> 15:44.526
is nobody's business except...

15:44.652 --> 15:46.361
She told me to end it.
Is that what you want?

15:46.696 --> 15:48.238
I was actually hoping
she'd fire one of you.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.116
- What are you doing?
- Trying to avoid altitude sickness.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.826
Couldn't score a direct flight
to Cambodia,

15:52.952 --> 15:56.496
so I've decided to scale Argentina's
infamous Mount Aconcagua.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.457
Perfect, except for the fact
that you can't walk.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.793
There's a tribe of MocovÃ­ Indians
who actually carry the elders up...

16:01.919 --> 16:02.794
You're insane.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.755
I'm an insane genius.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.257
I set the chamber to low pressure
instead of high.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.801
Thinner air builds up
the extra red blood cells,

16:09.927 --> 16:11.011
creates new capillaries.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.181
Few more days in here, I can save myself
six weeks at base camp.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.932
Where's my MRI?

16:18.728 --> 16:20.896
There's a blockage
in the urinary tract.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.981
Simple terms,
your baby can't pee.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.817
His bladder is swollen
and it's crushing his lungs.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.069
Can you fix it?

16:27.195 --> 16:29.696
We can insert a small tube
in the baby's bladder

16:29.822 --> 16:31.657
that makes the urine
come out straight through his belly

16:31.783 --> 16:33.659
for the duration
of the pregnancy.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.745
The bladder decompresses and the lungs
will be able to develop normally.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.998
When the baby gets better,
you should get better.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.000
First we just have to
do a test

16:42.126 --> 16:44.878
to determine whether the baby's kidneys
are functioning properly.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.797
And what if they're not?

16:46.923 --> 16:50.634
If they're already too damaged, then
there's really nothing we can do.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.929
If this doesn't work out,
you can always try again.

16:57.392 --> 17:00.018
I miscarried twice
when I was married.

17:00.812 --> 17:04.272
After the divorce, I tried in vitro like
four times before this.

17:05.108 --> 17:08.652
I'm 42. Maybe it's
just not meant to be.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.036
What are you doing?

17:18.663 --> 17:20.706
You're trying to be me,
so I thought I'd try to be you.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.165
You don't have
the cleavage for it.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.875
But I have a much tighter ass.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.337
Think every day should be
naked Thursday or is that an oxymoron?

17:29.465 --> 17:30.924
Let me see the results
from the bladder tap.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.718
They aren't back yet.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.261
They're gonna be inconclusive.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.929
You think my diagnosis
is wrong?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.682
Fetus doesn't pee,
amniotic fluid should be low.

17:38.808 --> 17:39.725
Mom's level is fine.

17:39.851 --> 17:40.976
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.853
Could just mean we caught
the obstruction early.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.646
Either way your test
will be inconclusive.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.856
The urine you've collected

17:45.982 --> 17:47.816
has been sitting in that fetus's bladder
for weeks.

17:47.942 --> 17:51.319
As my pappy always said,
"Stale pee is useless pee."

17:51.696 --> 17:53.113
Fine. I'll do another tap.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.322
Just as useless.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.743
Old urine drops down from the kidney
right after the first tap

17:57.869 --> 17:58.910
'cause it's so backed up.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.663
Bladder tap number three
will give you the freshest pee.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.458
That's when you'll find out if this
fetus has even a fighting chance.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.625
Thank you.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.753
I'll run two more taps.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.756
Since when does the Dean of Medicine
run bladder taps?

18:10.882 --> 18:11.965
She's an important patient.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.594
Because she takes pictures
or because she's you?

18:17.555 --> 18:19.723
Woman in her 40s, single,

18:20.808 --> 18:24.186
using a turkey baster
as a last gasp at motherhood.

18:25.104 --> 18:29.065
Maybe you want to make sure she succeeds
so you'll still have hope.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.819
You can't be a good doctor
if you're not objective.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.113
- It's your file.
- I don't want it.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.449
Then why did you just
say all that stuff?

18:37.575 --> 18:38.784
To humiliate you.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.244
- You're taking the case back.
- I don't want it.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.163
Your diagnosis is right.
I want to go on vacation.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.957
You can go on vacation
after you've cured her.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.380
Good news.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.801
The fetus's urine had appropriate levels
of protein and electrolytes,

18:55.927 --> 18:57.803
so its kidneys aren't damaged.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.680
Oh, wow.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.766
We're gonna put the shunt in.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.643
Your baby's lungs
should have more room to grow

19:04.769 --> 19:07.229
and your symptoms
should go away.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.190
But he'll still need surgery,
after he's born?

19:10.316 --> 19:12.692
That's when we'll remove the blockage
in the ureter.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.402
You'll be the only mother on the planet

19:14.529 --> 19:16.488
who appreciates the value of a wet
diaper.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.156
Hey, could you hand me that?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.533
I'm keeping
a visual memory book

19:19.659 --> 19:23.036
of this entire surreal process and this
is the best part of the story so far.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.038
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.375
When'd you take this?

19:28.751 --> 19:30.168
She did the
second bladder tap.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.254
You should keep it.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.215
Oh, I see her all day at work.
I don't need it.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.593
Maybe you want to see her
after work.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.221
I'm right, right?

19:42.974 --> 19:44.975
I saw the way you look at her.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.151
Thanks.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.956
The shunt is
in the right position.

20:08.082 --> 20:09.875
Bladder is starting
to decompress.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.501
No infection.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.214
Did House say anything else?
About us?

20:16.340 --> 20:19.885
I thought you didn't care about his
reaction. Trying to make him jealous?

20:20.303 --> 20:21.595
I like my job.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.680
He can't fire you
just because we're together.

20:23.806 --> 20:26.683
We're not "together,"
and House can do whatever he wants.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.731
- How's my baby?
- Doing just fine, Emma.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.733
- So are you.
- My stomach's killing me.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.736
That's not her stomach.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.364
Can you open your eyes, Emma?
I just need to take a look.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.453
What is it?

20:48.539 --> 20:50.665
Emma's jaundiced.
Her liver's shutting down.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.754
Figures. Just booked my trip
to Johnston Strait.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.882
I thought you were climbing
Mount Whatever in Argentina.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.843
Apparently I'd have to live
with the MocovÃ­ Indians for 20 years

21:01.969 --> 21:03.762
before they'd consider me
an elder.

21:03.888 --> 21:07.182
Decided to go kayaking
with orca instead. No legs required.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.560
Can't leave yet. Liver failure puts her
case back into the unsolved pile.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.897
Increased AST, ALT and her bilirubin's
off the charts.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.858
Even fetuses lie.

21:19.403 --> 21:23.657
We diagnosed a lower urinary tract
obstruction because we saw one.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.993
What if that's not
the whole story?

21:27.870 --> 21:30.914
What if the little bugger
is hiding something?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.917
The real reason
for the mirror syndrome.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.336
Have we looked under its bed?

21:36.462 --> 21:37.629
We checked its diary?

21:37.755 --> 21:39.297
If it's not GU,
could be the heart.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.507
Hypoplastic
left heart syndrome.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.258
- There were no structural problems.
- The lungs.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.135
We won't be able to
get a good look until they develop.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.221
- It'll be weeks...
- She's not gonna last weeks.

21:46.347 --> 21:47.639
What do you want to do?

21:47.765 --> 21:50.809
Maternal mirror syndrome
has one sure fire cure.

21:51.602 --> 21:52.727
Deliver the fetus.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.021
That's not viable at 21 weeks.
You'll kill the baby.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.399
- Fetus.
- Semantics make you feel better?

21:57.525 --> 21:58.525
Pretend it's not a person?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.694
Can it play catch? Can it eat?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.821
Can it take pretty pictures?

22:04.073 --> 22:05.907
Who wants to tell her?

22:13.416 --> 22:15.834
The swollen bladder
was not the only problem.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.755
We can't leave it inside you.
We have to terminate.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.716
Well, can't you deliver him?

22:22.842 --> 22:26.011
Put him on a respiratory machine
till you figure out what's wrong?

22:26.137 --> 22:28.388
We can. And it won't matter.

22:29.932 --> 22:33.393
The fetus is still at least
two weeks away from being viable.

22:33.686 --> 22:37.355
Well, I'll suffer through this
for two more weeks then.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.069
You're on dialysis for your kidneys.
Your kidneys can wait.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.573
They don't make dialysis
for your liver.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.785
You're not gonna make it
two more days.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.961
I'm not gonna let you
kill my baby.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.255
It's killing you.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.842
I'm not having an abortion.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.387
It's not a baby. It's a tumor.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.519
I understand
dying for a cause.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.897
Sacrificing your life
so your child might live.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.690
But that's not the choice here.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.863
Either it dies
or you both die.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.657
Or you fix him
and we both live.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.034
I can't fix it.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.832
I'm scheduling a D&C.

23:37.958 --> 23:38.917
I won't consent.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.881
So I guess you have two days
to figure it out.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.726
Her kidneys are
almost irreparable.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.854
She's developed severe DIC.
You have to force her to terminate.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.899
Did you give corticosteroids
to speed up the baby's lung development?

24:03.025 --> 24:06.611
No. I dropped an anvil on its chest
to prevent lung development.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.906
I'm trying to extinguish
the human race one fetus at a time.

24:10.032 --> 24:13.034
Give the lungs more time
to expand so you can see inside them.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.119
See if they're the problem.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.079
My real patient is dying.

24:16.205 --> 24:19.833
Very quickly. Like I wouldn't
advise her to buy any green bananas.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.876
The fetus is nothing more
than a parasite at this point.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.545
Removing it
is an instant cure.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.004
You're not gonna get Emma
to see it that way.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.339
She's probably already
named the baby,

24:26.465 --> 24:28.508
read him books,
had conversations with him.

24:28.634 --> 24:31.177
- See, you get it. She'll listen to you.
- No.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.555
If you let this woman
refuse to terminate,

24:33.681 --> 24:35.390
you're helping her commit suicide.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.184
As her doctor
my recommendation is against suicide.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.811
If the baby had a doctor,

24:39.937 --> 24:42.355
I think she would recommend exhausting
all possibilities

24:42.481 --> 24:44.816
- before taking its life.
- Then she'd be an idiot.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.776
Too bad she's your boss!

24:48.654 --> 24:50.446
What if our original
assumption is wrong?

24:50.573 --> 24:51.865
It isn't.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.616
If we assume
she doesn't have mirror syndrome,

24:53.742 --> 24:55.869
then terminating her pregnancy
isn't gonna help her liver at all.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.246
We eliminated
all other possibilities.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.373
The fetus is hydropic
and in distress.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.710
Emma's kidneys and liver
are failing. The diagnosis is solid.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.796
Wow! The ass-kisser
won't agree with you.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.381
You must be even wronger
than I thought.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.091
Fine.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.760
Let's assume she had
mirror syndrome

25:12.887 --> 25:15.847
but we fixed it when we fixed
the baby's bladder.

25:15.973 --> 25:19.726
That means that her failing liver
would be completely unrelated.

25:19.977 --> 25:23.313
If it is, we can fix it and
we don't have to terminate.

25:23.439 --> 25:26.399
So her theory is
that our patient's liver problems

25:26.525 --> 25:28.318
were just a giant coincidence.

25:28.819 --> 25:29.944
It's not a surprising
coincidence.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.238
Pregnant women
can develop liver problems.

25:32.364 --> 25:36.117
If this is the case,
we can actually do something here.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.995
Don't you guys
think that's worth exploring?

25:39.121 --> 25:41.998
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
would have the same symptoms.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.626
- Thank you.
- Brownnoser.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.796
- Viral hepatitis, HELLP syndrome.
- Oh, look.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.842
Sticking up for your girlfriend.
Who says chivalry's dead?

25:54.053 --> 25:55.845
He's not joking?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.932
Be patient. She's going
through all of us.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.768
She'll get
that jungle fever eventually.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.021
- I'm not going through anyone.
- You love him?

26:05.147 --> 26:07.899
This can probably wait until after you
biopsy Emma's liver, right?

26:08.025 --> 26:09.901
We can't.
Her platelets are too low.

26:10.027 --> 26:13.780
Once we pierce her liver, it'll be next
to impossible to stop the bleeding.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.156
Come in from above.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.284
Instead of going straight in
through her abdomen,

26:18.410 --> 26:19.869
go in through the veins
in her neck.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.830
Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

26:22.957 --> 26:26.751
If the liver starts to bleed, it'll
bleed right back into her own veins.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.347
Why don't you start
your vacation now?

26:46.230 --> 26:48.856
Threading the guide wire
through the right internal jugular vein.

26:48.983 --> 26:51.693
So, the sleep lab...

26:52.319 --> 26:54.320
You and Cameron not sleeping.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.073
How serious is it?

26:57.199 --> 26:58.032
It's nothing.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.368
She's only doing it
to make House jealous.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.829
- Then why are you doing it?
- You kidding?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.873
You're approaching the inferior
vena cava. Slow down.

27:07.543 --> 27:08.918
You better not hurt her.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.255
- She already has a big brother.
- She does?

27:12.381 --> 27:14.299
You obviously care
very deeply about her.

27:14.425 --> 27:17.010
I'm not protecting her.
I'm protecting myself.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.679
A heartbroken,
lovesick Cameron

27:19.805 --> 27:22.765
would be even more unbearable
than she is now.

27:23.225 --> 27:24.726
You're through
the hepatic vein.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.436
I'm firing the needle.

27:27.521 --> 27:30.148
Heart rate and BP spiking.
Get that out of her.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.859
Fetus's heart rate
just dropped to 50.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.779
- We've got contractions.
- Pre-term labor.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.948
Start a terbutaline drip!

27:47.791 --> 27:50.710
We were able to control
the pre-term labor with tocolytics.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.712
The contractions
have subsided for now.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.757
And the liver biopsy was negative.
This is definitely mirror syndrome.

27:55.883 --> 27:56.841
Her baby's doing this to her.

27:56.967 --> 27:57.800
We're out of options.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.511
Did the biopsy cause the pre-term labor
or did it happen on its own?

28:00.804 --> 28:01.637
It doesn't make a difference.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.264
Pre-term labor
can be a new symptom.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.933
New information gives us
new theories. Isn't that how it works?

28:06.060 --> 28:07.060
Not in this case.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.605
Her body's trying to do what you refuse
to, get the baby out and save itself.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.232
Patient's transaminases
are 10 times normal.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.151
Her liver is on the verge
of shutting down completely.

28:15.277 --> 28:16.402
A torch test could...

28:16.528 --> 28:18.279
We don't have time
for more tests.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.573
We have to terminate
or she'll die.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.743
Then let's work faster.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.829
Medicine doesn't work faster
just because you hope real hard.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.498
But it could help to see
what the baby's been hiding.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.085
The only organ we haven't been able
to look inside is its lungs.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.294
The problem must be in there.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.089
We haven't been able to see inside
because they're underdeveloped.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.132
We've already got her on
corticosteroids,

28:38.258 --> 28:39.258
but it'll
take weeks for them...

28:39.468 --> 28:42.428
Then let's drown them
in corticosteroids, multiple courses.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.429
Speed up their development.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.432
Giving the baby more than one course
will suppress adrenal gland function.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.602
Have long-term adverse effects
on fetal organ development.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.604
- Worse than death?
- Emma's already on tocolytics.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.815
The combination could put her
into pulmonary edema.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.066
You'll just kill her faster.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.693
It's the only chance we have
to see inside those lungs.

28:57.820 --> 29:01.572
We're just gonna have to make the baby
better faster than we make Emma worse.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.575
Come on! This is the kind
of thing House does every day.

29:04.785 --> 29:07.412
House thought we should
terminate six hours ago.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.041
I'll do it myself.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.257
Anybody gonna stop her?

29:19.591 --> 29:21.008
Stopping the madness
is her job.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.678
Somebody's got to be
Cuddy's Cuddy.

29:32.688 --> 29:33.521
Nurse!

29:39.611 --> 29:42.405
- Pulmonary edema?
- Who tattled? It doesn't matter.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.533
There's a reason we don't give
multiple courses of corticosteroids.

29:45.659 --> 29:46.993
Gee, thanks.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.411
It's time to terminate.

29:48.871 --> 29:49.704
That's not what she wants.

29:49.913 --> 29:50.913
Look at her.

29:51.290 --> 29:55.668
She didn't want to be an incubator for a
dead baby, but that's what you've done.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.463
Either get me a laryngoscope
or get out!

30:42.466 --> 30:43.966
You were right.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.760
You were all right.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.221
Now the mom's lungs
are shutting down.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.266
She's dying faster than the baby's lungs
are developing.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.393
I had to stop
the corticosteroids.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.229
Have you spoken to the family?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.773
The only family she's got
is that baby.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.274
Well, he's biased.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.486
What do you think
House would do?

31:03.612 --> 31:05.029
House wants to terminate.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.156
I mean if he didn't.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.742
If he shared my position,
what do you think he would do?

31:10.118 --> 31:11.786
He wouldn't share your pain.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.372
He'd be objective.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.123
Right.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.461
- He would prioritize his problems.
- He'd terminate.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.381
He wouldn't be afraid of screwing with
her lungs if there was a bigger issue.

31:23.674 --> 31:24.674
There is no bigger issue.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.717
- She needs her lungs.
- Not right now.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.678
She's already on a respirator.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.012
The machine is
breathing for her.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.847
I can do whatever
I want to her lungs.

31:31.974 --> 31:34.892
If you're playing catch in the living
room and you break your mother's vase,

31:35.018 --> 31:37.311
you may as well keep playing catch.
The vase is already broken.

31:37.437 --> 31:41.148
Yeah, except that room
can't breathe without that vase.

31:41.358 --> 31:44.026
I'm putting her back on
corticosteroids.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.326
- It worked.
- What worked?

31:52.452 --> 31:54.120
I got the baby's lungs
to expand.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.997
- We should be able to figure...
- Cab's on its way.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.082
I have to finish packing.

31:59.710 --> 32:02.044
I have a whole new
appreciation for what you do.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.463
How hard it is to believe
when everyone around you

32:04.590 --> 32:05.423
is telling you
that you're wrong.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.508
Helps to know they're idiots.

32:07.801 --> 32:10.052
Do you think I'm an idiot?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.013
You're not objective.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.683
But you're not an idiot.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.855
These lungs are still two weeks away
from being viable.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.440
But big enough
for a diagnosis.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.233
These tissue buds are new.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.902
Could indicate
bronchopulmonary sequestration

32:27.029 --> 32:28.821
or diaphragmatic eventration.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.782
I was thinking bronchogenic
cyst or bronchial atresia.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.618
Could be lung lesions, CCAM.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.036
What about...

32:42.794 --> 32:43.919
Move.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.215
Thought you
started your vacation.

32:48.342 --> 32:51.344
Somebody had to save
our boss's rotundus ass.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.763
Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.348
Small buds in the lungs
could indicate...

32:55.474 --> 32:57.475
Thanks. Got the multiple choice
all worked out.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.936
Question is, how do we pick between
A, B, C, D, and none of the above?

33:01.063 --> 33:03.272
Portable MRI is in her room.
We could get a current image.

33:03.398 --> 33:06.400
The fetal lungs are so tiny the MRI
won't give us the details we need.

33:06.526 --> 33:10.655
What would we do if this patient
were not just a tadpole?

33:10.781 --> 33:11.906
Say it was an actual person.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.574
He is a person.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.950
Thanks for playing along.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.036
Pretend it's
a one-pound adult.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.789
Forget the mom,
forget the womb, the placenta.

33:20.207 --> 33:22.625
How would we get a better look
at what's in the lungs?

33:22.751 --> 33:23.751
Transesophageal echo.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.211
Can't access his esophagus.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.879
High resolution CT
could give us a clearer...

33:27.005 --> 33:29.674
Too much radiation
for a one-pound person.

33:29.925 --> 33:33.052
You can't just shoot
everything down, Chase.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.471
You're not me. Collaborate.

33:36.390 --> 33:38.724
A ventilation perfusion scan
would be next.

33:39.142 --> 33:42.436
How do we get a fetus to breathe
in a radioactive isotope, idiot?

33:43.188 --> 33:45.231
If it were really a person
and we had no other options

33:45.357 --> 33:46.899
we'd do an
exploratory surgery.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.276
Cut into its chest
and have a look around.

33:49.403 --> 33:50.736
Let's do that.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.615
You're the one who insists
we treat it like a person.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.575
I'll put it back
when I'm done.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.038
Me again.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.833
It's your friendly
neighborhood belly squirter.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.960
We're gonna do
open fetal surgery.

34:06.086 --> 34:09.004
Open the uterus,
cut out the fetus so we can look around.

34:09.548 --> 34:13.342
I know you can't talk so I need you
to look petrified if you consent.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.428
The umbilical cord
won't be cut.

34:15.846 --> 34:19.223
During surgery, your body will basically
serve as the baby's heart/lung machine.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.976
We find what's wrong
and we fix it.

34:22.436 --> 34:23.269
If we can.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.564
Don't lower expectations
if you want them to do something.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.066
She should know
what she's facing.

34:32.154 --> 34:34.280
This is incredibly dangerous.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.323
It risks both your lives.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.325
The only reason
why we're suggesting it,

34:38.452 --> 34:41.078
is because there's
nothing else we can do.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.645
You all here
for the fetal surgery?

35:06.897 --> 35:08.898
'Cause we're
way over capacity.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.649
Mind each other's
personal space.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.194
There are sharp implements
in the room.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.695
Like this one.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.497
Uterus is fully exposed.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.632
And we're in.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.967
Start draining
the amniotic fluid.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.139
Have you never sucked beer
out of the bottom of a keg?

35:42.474 --> 35:44.391
Where'd you go to college?
Give me that.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.295
Affix the pulse ox
to the palm.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.760
House?

36:22.138 --> 36:23.138
Sorry.

36:23.765 --> 36:26.016
Just realized
I forgot to TiVo Alien.

36:33.275 --> 36:36.193
Fetal heart rate good.
Stats are stable.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.280
Position him for the incision.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.079
I see three well-defined
lesions.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.124
It's definitely CCAM.
I should be able to resect them.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.546
It's the mom. She's in V-fib.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.591
Charging.

37:00.302 --> 37:02.428
- Clear!
- I'm clear.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.557
Looks like asystole.
Paddling isn't going to do anything.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.809
It's fine V-fib.
I'm going again. Clear!

37:11.771 --> 37:13.814
We're gonna lose them both.
Clamp!

37:15.150 --> 37:17.276
The surgery's not doing this to her.
The fetus is.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.819
Step away, House.
I'm going again.

37:18.945 --> 37:22.489
The only way to save her is to cut away
the anchor holding her down.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.117
You keep going,
you're gonna get electrocuted.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.828
Clear!

37:28.663 --> 37:31.332
Going again. Clear!

37:33.793 --> 37:36.462
Heart rate's returning
to normal.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.383
Continue with the lobectomy.

37:50.727 --> 37:53.979
So my kidneys, liver and lungs
are all fine just like that?

37:55.231 --> 37:57.608
- Just like that.
- That's amazing.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.404
What's amazing is how blonde
your baby's hair is.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.408
My baby?

38:06.534 --> 38:08.494
The thing in your belly
that tried to kill you.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.955
You've never called him
a baby before.

38:17.712 --> 38:18.712
Any pain?

38:19.005 --> 38:20.506
Nothing I can't deal with.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.050
You can only get out of bed
to pee, pooh or shower.

38:23.176 --> 38:26.553
And absolutely no sex.
So stop flirting with me.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.306
Sorry.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.270
So this really worked?
He'll be normal?

38:36.690 --> 38:39.984
Well, if you call
being born twice normal.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.699
Hey, thank you.

38:49.953 --> 38:53.455
Don't thank me.
I would've killed the kid.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.842
- Wanna grab a bite?
- In a minute.

39:04.968 --> 39:07.052
Emma asked me to
bring up her camera.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.971
I'll walk with you.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.559
When'd she take
this picture of you?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.687
You look so...

39:17.063 --> 39:18.147
I'm smiling.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.983
I have a nice smile.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.444
No, I've never
seen you like this.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.904
She got you to glow.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.741
What were you doing?

39:29.534 --> 39:31.493
What did she say to you?

39:32.787 --> 39:34.371
I always glow.

39:46.634 --> 39:47.760
House.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.304
Need you to take
a look at something.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.848
- I'm off the clock.
- Just open it.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.148
A first-class ticket
to Vancouver Island.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.359
Shoot! The wrong envelope.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.657
- I think it's great.
- Yeah.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.952
- Who doesn't like Canadians?
- It's big.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.289
You're trying to have a life.
You're trying to enjoy yourself.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.041
You didn't need to apologize.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.709
I'm not. I told you why I...

40:20.835 --> 40:22.002
Screwed up.

40:22.128 --> 40:23.587
I saved a life.
I saved two lives.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.214
You

40:25.882 --> 40:30.052
let your maternal instinct get the best
of you and nearly kill two people.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.721
Case like this, you terminate,
mom lives 10 times out of 10.

40:32.847 --> 40:33.889
You do what you did

40:34.015 --> 40:36.642
mom and baby both die
9.9 times out of 10.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.770
Sometimes point one
is bigger than 9.9.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.814
No, it's smaller.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.192
Exactly 9.8 smaller.
Always is. Always will be.

40:45.902 --> 40:48.737
Well, not for Emma.
And not for her son.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.242
Now go away and be happy.
