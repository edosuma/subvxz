00:42.677 --> 00:43.644
I got your message.

00:43.678 --> 00:45.546
I don't, I don't know
what to think.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.647
I'm on my way.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.086
Please give me a call.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.422
You sounded so upset,
I'm worried.

02:08.763 --> 02:11.065
What's wrong, Nathan?

02:11.099 --> 02:13.701
Something's
happened. Something really bad.

02:29.117 --> 02:31.152
There's
something you should know.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.254
We've never talked about it.

02:33.287 --> 02:36.190
In fact, I never told anyone.

02:36.224 --> 02:39.093
When I was a kid
my parents split up.

02:39.127 --> 02:40.728
I lived with my father.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.565
He and I didn't get along.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.735
It seemed like he never
approved of anything I did.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.838
He had my whole life
mapped out for me.

02:50.972 --> 02:53.607
And he wasn't concerned
about what I wanted.

02:55.243 --> 02:58.746
I met a girl
named Cecilia at Stanford.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.015
I had it really bad for her.

03:01.049 --> 03:02.483
I was gonna marry her.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.187
Until that weekend.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.756
A family friend, Becki
was getting married.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.025
My dad's girlfriend,
Vanessa, was in the wedding,

03:11.059 --> 03:13.694
So Becki had invited them
to stay at her parents' place

03:13.727 --> 03:15.964
On the lake a couple of days
before the ceremony.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.237
My father wasn't social,

03:23.271 --> 03:25.373
So he'd typically start
drinking right away.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.975
Henry.

03:27.008 --> 03:28.609
What?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.778
Make it two, Henry.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.413
- Hey!
- Hey!

03:32.446 --> 03:33.781
No one
really seemed to mind, though.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.250
In fact, people were always
trying to please my father.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.052
Hey, that's a good
single malt I picked up.

03:38.086 --> 03:39.787
Let me know
what you think of that.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.622
I will.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.591
Good thing we got here
before the storm hit.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.826
God, you look good!

03:45.860 --> 03:47.661
Look who's talking.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.464
You cut the hair,
you shaved the goatee.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.732
That's a very sexy look
on you.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.002
- Thank you.
- Hey, easy you two.

03:54.035 --> 03:55.769
Hey, don't worry.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.805
There's only one girl
I'm taking to Fiji.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.007
Oh!

03:59.040 --> 04:00.408
So how about it?
You wanna go to Fiji?

04:00.441 --> 04:02.010
- Hey!
- I'd love it!

04:02.043 --> 04:04.178
Complete asses!

04:04.212 --> 04:05.479
I'm sorry, did I just loose
myself for a minute?

04:05.513 --> 04:06.614
She looks so good.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.149
Okay!

04:08.182 --> 04:09.783
What does every...
What do we need here?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.685
At first, I
wasn't gonna go to the wedding,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.687
But Cecilia
talked me into it.

04:13.721 --> 04:14.822
Look, there's what the law is,

04:14.855 --> 04:16.824
There's what the law
shouldn't be.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.027
You know, I don't understand
why they don't implement

04:19.060 --> 04:21.029
A law that says if you,

04:21.062 --> 04:23.797
Make the loan
you assume the risk,

04:23.831 --> 04:25.699
You manage that risk,

04:25.733 --> 04:27.668
No selling off
to a third party.

04:27.701 --> 04:31.105
You don't understand why they
make the law like that?

04:31.139 --> 04:33.174
No, I don't understand why
they don't make that law,

04:33.207 --> 04:35.609
Why they don't implement
that law.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.711
Well, maybe you should talk
to your congressman.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.781
You know, I mean 'cause
that's how laws get changed.

04:40.814 --> 04:44.718
I'm just ah, working inside
a, you know, a set of rules,

04:44.752 --> 04:47.021
And uh, playing by the rules.

04:47.055 --> 04:48.456
I mean what you're talking
about now

04:48.489 --> 04:51.059
Is changing the rules
in the middle of the game.

04:51.092 --> 04:53.861
And uh, ya know, as long
as the rules are set up

04:53.894 --> 04:55.696
The way they are,
I'm gonna play the best,

04:55.729 --> 04:57.798
You know, I can.
I mean, I mean, you are,

04:57.831 --> 04:59.133
You're in Africa,
you're doing your deal,

04:59.167 --> 05:00.969
But uh, you know,
I got a family and a,

05:01.002 --> 05:02.870
A lot of obligations.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.974
They were always
long-winded political conversations.

05:06.007 --> 05:09.177
They would go on
and on and on.

05:09.210 --> 05:11.112
Nothing ever got solved.

05:12.346 --> 05:16.317
With my father,
it was all about money.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.019
Well, that's my point.
Is that, is that

05:18.052 --> 05:19.687
The situation is able to be
exploited...

05:19.720 --> 05:21.889
It's open!

05:21.922 --> 05:23.691
We'll continue this.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.725
- Hey!
- Oh, wow!

05:24.758 --> 05:28.062
- Ahh, Nathan, you came!
- Oh!

05:28.096 --> 05:30.731
- Hi.
- Hi, Cecilia!

05:30.764 --> 05:32.733
So good to see you.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.567
- Vanessa!
- Hey, how you doing?

05:33.601 --> 05:35.203
Good.

05:35.236 --> 05:38.039
My father didn't
seem very exited to see Cecilia and me.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.541
I wasn't sure you guys were
gonna be able to make it, so,

05:40.574 --> 05:43.244
I kept it a surprise.
Surprise!

05:43.277 --> 05:45.546
This is a surprise.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.948
- Hey!
- Good one, I hope.

05:47.982 --> 05:50.184
Definitely.

05:50.218 --> 05:51.785
- Oh, perfect.
- Hmm-hmm.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.554
No, thank you.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.689
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.025
It's that simple
"No, thank you"

05:57.058 --> 05:58.459
And look how thin she is.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.761
Wine is low carb.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.930
You really should try some.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.532
Maybe later.

06:04.565 --> 06:08.636
So I'm doing a story on this
group that's building a well

06:08.669 --> 06:12.073
For a village in Zimbabwe.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.075
For 125 dollars,

06:14.108 --> 06:16.644
A whole village
could have clean water.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.646
Wow, that's really cool.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.782
It's true, a woman's
intuition is very perceptive.

06:21.815 --> 06:22.883
Well, I guess mine isn't,

06:22.916 --> 06:24.218
'Cause I didn't have
a fucking clue.

06:24.252 --> 06:25.753
I thought we were driving
to LA

06:25.786 --> 06:27.321
'Cause he was going
to a conference.

06:27.355 --> 06:29.123
We're driving up Highway 1
and, honestly,

06:29.157 --> 06:31.725
I was annoyed because I get
car sick on windy roads.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.161
Oh, my God, tell me about it.

06:33.194 --> 06:35.663
I was sick
the whole way here.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.599
Yeah, and um,

06:38.632 --> 06:41.635
I'm, I'm sitting next
to this old woman,

06:41.669 --> 06:44.004
And her skin is like leather.

06:44.038 --> 06:46.907
It's like she
has so much... depth

06:46.940 --> 06:49.077
And history in her face.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.912
And um, and she's staring
at me.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.815
Now, I'm,
I'm not joking around,

06:54.848 --> 06:57.285
I mean she wasn't being subtle,
she was really staring at me.

06:57.318 --> 07:02.524
And uh, and so I smiled
and it took her a second

07:03.557 --> 07:07.761
And then she smiled back and
her whole being just lit up.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.665
- It was beautiful.
- Wow.

07:11.699 --> 07:12.866
It's sight connection, man,

07:12.900 --> 07:14.835
That's, that's why
I do what I do.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.437
Pulls off by
El Matador beach

07:16.470 --> 07:18.272
And says he wants to look at
the view, so we walk off

07:18.306 --> 07:20.040
To this little side area
and go over this bluff

07:20.074 --> 07:22.710
And overlooking this
incredible ocean view

07:22.743 --> 07:24.945
Is a table
with a white table cloth,

07:24.978 --> 07:27.348
Waiter with a bow tie,
a guy playing a violin...

07:27.381 --> 07:28.982
A violin?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.485
Wow, he went all out.
That's romantic.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.487
And you know the crazy thing
is about this?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.823
Is that I look at him
when I see this

07:35.856 --> 07:37.358
And I'm like...

07:37.391 --> 07:38.859
"Wow, why don't you ever do
anything romantic

07:38.892 --> 07:41.795
Like that for me?"

07:41.829 --> 07:43.131
So he says
"Funny you should ask. "

07:43.164 --> 07:44.965
And he gets down on one knee.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.467
- Pretty amazing.
- Yeah.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.238
Man, um, I wish I could
do something like that.

07:50.271 --> 07:52.806
You should give me a call
when you finish school.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.509
You know, we, um, we're
always looking for interns.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.811
Yeah, I'm, I'm actually done.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.348
I'm not going to grad school.

08:00.381 --> 08:01.349
Oh.

08:01.382 --> 08:02.383
So, what're you gonna do?

08:02.416 --> 08:04.152
I know I don't
want to do that.

08:04.185 --> 08:06.086
Hey, guys, what's shaking?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.721
Well, Nathan
was just telling me how

08:07.755 --> 08:10.524
He's not going
to graduate school.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.559
What?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.927
I hadn't actually
told my father yet.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.230
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.067
Would you excuse us?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.835
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.378
What the fuck are you
talking about?

08:30.411 --> 08:33.113
You're not going
to grad school?

08:33.147 --> 08:35.783
I thought about it
and I made up my mind.

08:35.816 --> 08:36.917
I... it's not what I wanna do.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.751
You made up your mind?

08:38.785 --> 08:39.919
Yeah.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.953
Do you know how much money

08:40.988 --> 08:43.691
I have invested
in your education?

08:46.227 --> 08:47.761
I mean, it cost me
40,000 dollars

08:47.795 --> 08:49.963
To put you through
first grade.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.801
50,000 dollars
for second grade.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.036
It just went up from there.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.871
It didn't go well.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.575
You're going
to graduate school.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.577
No if, ands, or buts!

09:03.611 --> 09:06.079
That's what I love.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.881
- Hey, I got to run.
- Bye.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.250
So, I'll meet you
at the caterer's later?

09:09.283 --> 09:11.285
Yes, good, yeah.

09:11.319 --> 09:13.387
Becki just told us
about the proposal.

09:13.421 --> 09:15.589
I had no idea you were
such a romantic.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.291
It just took the right girl
to bring it out of me.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.728
Hey, I already said "yes. "

09:20.761 --> 09:22.230
No need to sweet talk me.

09:22.263 --> 09:23.997
Really?
Take it while you can get it.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.066
Yeah, or someone else might.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.737
- What?
- Well...

09:30.838 --> 09:32.072
You better keep
sweet talking.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.975
I guess they've convinced me,
what else you got?

09:35.008 --> 09:36.844
Uh...

09:36.877 --> 09:38.579
I'll think of something
on the drive.

09:38.612 --> 09:39.847
- Okay, it better be good.
- Alright.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.850
- Better be good, love you.
- Love you.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.085
A bachelor's degree doesn't
mean what it used to.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.687
Not in this economy.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.490
I don't understand why
it matters so much.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.124
Because it's your future.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.860
Right, it's my future.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.596
Yeah, and I'm paying
the bills.

09:55.629 --> 09:59.199
You're going to graduate
school, end of story.

09:59.233 --> 10:01.869
Why, so I can end up
like you?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.637
What?

10:03.671 --> 10:05.072
I heard that.

10:09.477 --> 10:11.679
- How are things with you?
- Oh, great.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.314
How are things with you?

10:14.248 --> 10:16.484
Good, good.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.688
So, how are things with
you and Nathan going?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.391
Great, Henry.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.027
You and Vanessa?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.533
Things are pretty good.

10:32.566 --> 10:33.901
Pretty good.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.404
I called you.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.539
I called you back.

10:38.572 --> 10:40.541
Yeah, and I couldn't talk
because I was with Nathan,

10:40.574 --> 10:42.109
So I called you back.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.979
Okay, what do you want?

10:48.916 --> 10:50.818
We need to talk, Henry.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.153
Why?

10:53.186 --> 10:54.588
What's there to talk about?

10:54.622 --> 10:56.089
Because something happened.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.758
It's not something
I can just forget about.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.293
Okay, alright.

11:01.762 --> 11:02.996
Talk, what do you wanna know?

11:03.030 --> 11:04.097
What do you wanna talk about?

11:04.131 --> 11:06.199
- Oh, my God, really?
- What?

11:07.568 --> 11:12.005
- Let's talk about this.
- Okay, alright.

11:14.308 --> 11:16.344
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:16.377 --> 11:17.611
Okay.

11:18.479 --> 11:20.247
What happened...

11:21.715 --> 11:23.150
It was...

11:24.552 --> 11:25.519
It was pretty passionate.

11:25.553 --> 11:28.088
Yeah, yeah.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.057
It was pretty passionate.

11:31.158 --> 11:35.262
So, I was just thinking that...

11:37.965 --> 11:40.067
Maybe you and me would be...

11:41.969 --> 11:45.272
You wanna sh...

11:45.305 --> 11:47.040
You wanna keep it up?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.944
I'm, I'm, I'm down.

11:51.779 --> 11:55.616
- Really?
- Definitely, definitely.

11:55.649 --> 11:58.218
Looking back
on it, I guess there were signs.

11:58.251 --> 12:03.090
Cool, but, you know, we got
to be really careful.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.592
I mean, really careful.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.960
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alright?

12:06.994 --> 12:09.630
I can just tell by the way
his eyes light up

12:09.663 --> 12:12.466
When he looks at her.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.967
He's gonna ask her
to marry him.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.571
- You really think so?
- Mm-hmm.

12:19.507 --> 12:21.675
That's all we
fucking need, man.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.912
And I really think
it's a second chance for you

12:24.945 --> 12:27.180
And Nathan to connect
and bond.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.082
It's about time
for that to happen.

12:30.451 --> 12:32.152
Yeah, maybe you're right.

12:33.554 --> 12:35.589
I know that you didn't wanna
come with me this weekend,

12:35.623 --> 12:38.526
But it means a lot
to me that you came.

12:38.559 --> 12:40.027
Thank you.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.430
No, I'm, I'm glad I came.

12:42.463 --> 12:45.032
This could be a nice time.

12:45.065 --> 12:48.502
You know, we got a little
time before dinner.

12:52.573 --> 12:53.941
You're talking
about five minutes?

12:53.974 --> 12:57.811
I sure am.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.080
I'm good.
I'm down.

13:03.484 --> 13:06.019
Don't you think we should
get back downstairs?

13:06.053 --> 13:08.221
Why?
So I can listen to my dad

13:08.255 --> 13:09.957
Talk to me about
school some more?

13:11.659 --> 13:12.826
He is your dad.

13:12.860 --> 13:13.861
So?

13:13.894 --> 13:15.195
So?

13:15.228 --> 13:18.666
He has the right to be
concerned about your future.

13:18.699 --> 13:20.901
It's not my future
he's concerned about.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.303
It's his status.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.473
He wants what's best
for you, Nathan.

13:25.506 --> 13:27.475
So he says.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.376
Nathan.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.780
Okay, okay.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.220
Hey, do you think uh...

13:40.253 --> 13:42.255
If I go down there
and deal with him,

13:42.289 --> 13:46.159
Maybe I can come back up here
and deal with you a bit?

13:47.628 --> 13:48.896
Maybe.

13:48.929 --> 13:52.466
Maybe as in 80, 90% chance?

13:53.901 --> 13:56.269
We'll see how it goes.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.706
Alright, I have a feeling
it's going to go very well.

14:00.908 --> 14:01.909
Come, come on in.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.410
- Okay, I gotta go, bye.
- Hey.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.747
Hey, so, I'm gonna head out.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.081
- Okay.
- But Evan's gonna stop by.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.282
He wanted to see you
before the wedding.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.553
- Oh, that's great!
- I miss him, how is he?

14:12.586 --> 14:13.687
He's Evan.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.126
He's still trying to figure
out what he's doing

14:19.159 --> 14:20.260
With his life.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.895
I think Evan just needs
to find himself.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.698
Oh, really?
Really?

14:24.732 --> 14:26.133
Why, why do people say that?

14:26.166 --> 14:29.269
- Say what?
- Uh, make excuses for him.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.071
I swear to God,
I love him so much,

14:31.104 --> 14:32.973
But he's never been held
accountable for anything

14:33.006 --> 14:34.207
In is entire life.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.275
What are you talking about?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.144
Well, um, I know you haven't
seen him in a while,

14:37.177 --> 14:38.712
But he's pretty much doing
the same thing

14:38.746 --> 14:41.048
He's always been doing.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.116
Didn't he finish college?

14:43.150 --> 14:46.119
No, it's like,
grow the fuck up already.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.589
You know, I know you
hate it when I compare,

14:48.622 --> 14:50.057
But...

14:50.090 --> 14:51.559
Nathan, who's
ten years younger,

14:51.592 --> 14:53.226
Graduated from Stanford,

14:53.260 --> 14:55.663
Got accepted
to Berkeley Law School...

14:57.330 --> 14:59.733
Nathan's a good kid,
Henry got lucky.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.403
How are you two doing?

15:03.436 --> 15:04.838
We're good.

15:04.872 --> 15:07.775
- Really?
- Yes, we're good.

15:07.808 --> 15:10.443
Look, I know you know about
all the girls...

15:11.478 --> 15:13.146
Yeah, all of 'em.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.749
Yup, the girls,
the drinking, all of it.

15:15.783 --> 15:17.417
But he's a different man now.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.753
We've been together
for two years.

15:19.787 --> 15:21.021
That's true.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.290
And I think, honestly,
I think that was

15:23.323 --> 15:26.627
A turning point for him.
You know, I think solid now.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.629
It's...

15:28.662 --> 15:31.331
Okay, I'm gonna go.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.365
Because the road down
the mountain's

15:32.399 --> 15:34.501
Really rough in the rain.
Yeah.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.771
I'm sorry, I just don't want
to see you get hurt again.

15:37.805 --> 15:39.072
I know.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.275
I love you.

15:43.877 --> 15:47.214
I love you, too.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.018
And... you're right,

15:51.051 --> 15:52.452
I should probably
give Henry a chance,

15:52.485 --> 15:54.154
So I'll work on it.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.356
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.392
Bye, I'm getting married.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.862
I'm so exited.

16:03.897 --> 16:07.234
Oh, hey, I guess this whole
marriage thing means uh,

16:07.267 --> 16:09.136
We won't be
hooking up anymore.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.706
You're unbelievable.

16:12.740 --> 16:14.074
Why?

16:15.676 --> 16:18.245
Because Vanessa just got through
telling me how

16:18.278 --> 16:20.380
She's turned you around.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.382
- Oh!
- Good job.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.284
We'll see about that.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.227
I was so nervous
to talk to you about this.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.896
You don't have to be nervous.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.230
You can talk to me.

16:38.298 --> 16:43.036
Okay, I know this isn't
really conventional.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.738
You're a little bit
older than me.

16:44.772 --> 16:46.506
A little bit.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.276
Yeah, but I think
we can be happy.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.744
Of course.

16:52.946 --> 16:55.916
This is such a relief,

16:55.949 --> 16:58.085
And don't worry,
I'm gonna wait

16:58.118 --> 17:00.788
Until after the weekend
to end things with Nathan.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.693
End things with Nathan?

17:05.726 --> 17:08.796
Oh, why would you do that?

17:08.829 --> 17:10.396
Why wouldn't I do that?

17:12.132 --> 17:15.068
Whoa, whoa, I mean,
we're not telling Nathan

17:15.102 --> 17:17.436
Or Vanessa anything.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.472
Well, what the hell did you
think we were gonna do?

17:19.506 --> 17:23.443
I, shh, I, I, you know,
I thought...

17:23.476 --> 17:24.778
What?
You were just gonna keep me

17:24.811 --> 17:26.780
In an apartment and fuck me
whenever you wanted?

17:26.814 --> 17:30.150
What did you think?

17:30.183 --> 17:32.786
That you were gonna break up
with Nathan and that I was...

17:32.820 --> 17:34.587
You know, break,
gonna break with Vanessa

17:34.621 --> 17:36.389
And we're gonna live
happily ever after?

17:36.423 --> 17:37.490
Yes!

17:37.524 --> 17:39.927
Break up with them
so we can be together!

17:39.960 --> 17:41.561
That's crazy!

17:41.594 --> 17:44.297
That's fucking crazy!

17:44.331 --> 17:46.033
I can't do that!

17:48.535 --> 17:50.437
Henry...

17:50.470 --> 17:51.972
What?

17:53.273 --> 17:55.008
There's something
I need to tell you.

17:55.042 --> 17:58.445
Cecilia, you wanna help me in
the kitchen with something?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.380
Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.759
Evan should be here soon.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.493
We're gonna go to dinner.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.163
In the meantime, uh,
sure you don't want a bite?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.965
Yeah.

18:17.998 --> 18:22.535
Okay, well, while we're
waiting for Evan,

18:22.569 --> 18:24.872
Why don't you spend
a little time with Nathan?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.209
Yeah.
Alright.

18:32.746 --> 18:34.347
I just don't understand.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.516
You act like it's prison.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.486
For me it might as well be.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.388
Well, what do you wanna do?

18:42.389 --> 18:44.057
I don't know,

18:45.058 --> 18:48.061
But I wanna take
some time to figure it out.

18:48.095 --> 18:50.297
Well, while you're
figuring it out,

18:50.330 --> 18:54.001
The other guys are
leaving you behind!

18:54.034 --> 18:56.736
Don't you want me to do
something I enjoy?

18:56.770 --> 18:59.572
Enjoy?
Yeah, sure.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.542
We all should find something
we enjoy.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.312
To hell with the
responsibility and hard work!

19:05.345 --> 19:07.981
You wanna talk
to me about responsibility?

19:09.582 --> 19:12.352
Sa-what did you say?
What did you just say to me?

19:12.385 --> 19:13.486
- Nothing.
- Say it again!

19:13.520 --> 19:15.388
- Nothing.
- Say it again!

19:16.456 --> 19:18.591
Who the fuck do you
think you are?!

19:20.627 --> 19:24.497
Meanwhile, I'm going
through a string of losers.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.499
It's funny how things
turn out.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.702
Well, she seems happy.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.272
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?

19:33.540 --> 19:36.209
God, what is that smell?

19:36.243 --> 19:38.245
What?

19:38.278 --> 19:41.448
You don't smell that?
It's terrible!

19:41.481 --> 19:43.550
You mean the coffee?

19:43.583 --> 19:44.451
Is that coffee?

19:44.484 --> 19:47.520
Yeah, I was just making
us a cup.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.090
Oh, none for me.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.192
Wait a second.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.961
Heighten sense of smell,

19:53.994 --> 19:57.230
No wine for you...

19:57.264 --> 19:59.432
Oh, my God!

19:59.466 --> 20:00.934
You're pregnant!

20:02.135 --> 20:03.103
Does Nathan know?

20:03.136 --> 20:04.237
No!

20:04.271 --> 20:06.306
He does not know, and I,

20:06.339 --> 20:08.541
I'm actually not ready
to tell him yet.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.477
I wanna ask Cecilia
to marry me.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.611
What?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.446
Come on, you heard me.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.248
Nathan, listen to me...

20:15.282 --> 20:19.819
No, don't you,
don't call me Nathan!

20:19.853 --> 20:22.655
Every time you call me Nathan
you're just trying to con me

20:22.689 --> 20:23.924
Into doing something.

20:23.957 --> 20:27.127
I have never conned you.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.629
Every time you call me Nathan

20:29.662 --> 20:32.265
I just wait
for the axe to drop.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.937
This is fucking stupid, man.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.973
This is like really fucking
stupid, you're 20 years old.

20:40.007 --> 20:42.475
I'm 22!

20:42.509 --> 20:44.577
Okay, you're 22 years old,

20:44.611 --> 20:46.513
But, how long
have you known her?

20:46.546 --> 20:47.847
Year and a half?

20:47.881 --> 20:50.517
I knew you'd react like this.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.752
I see the way
you look at Cecilia.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.154
What?

20:54.187 --> 20:56.156
You're always judging her.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.325
- I am not!
- Why?

20:58.358 --> 20:59.759
You don't think she's good
enough for me?

20:59.792 --> 21:01.661
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

21:01.694 --> 21:04.531
I just know that you
shouldn't fucking marry her...

21:04.564 --> 21:05.832
Now.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.536
It's stupid, it's a stupid
fucking idea!

21:09.569 --> 21:11.371
It's really not a big deal.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.306
So he doesn't go straight
into grad school.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.641
You can always go later.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.177
Meanwhile everyone else'll
have a year of law school

21:17.210 --> 21:18.845
Under their belt.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.114
I'm just not interested
in the law.

21:22.715 --> 21:23.616
What?
Now you're talking about

21:23.650 --> 21:26.519
Not being a lawyer
at all, period?

21:26.553 --> 21:29.990
Henry, he can always go back
if he changes his mind.

21:30.023 --> 21:32.725
You know what?
I gotta get out of here.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.336
- Hey, you must be Nathan.
- Yeah.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.537
You weren't leaving,
were you?

21:44.571 --> 21:46.006
I was.

21:46.039 --> 21:49.376
Oh, nobody's going anywhere.
The road's washed out.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.710
Perfect.

21:50.743 --> 21:54.581
Not to worry, I got a 15 year
old bottle of scotch.

21:56.616 --> 21:59.652
- Hi, Evan.
- Vanessa, hi!

22:00.753 --> 22:03.223
- You look amazing!
- Oh, stop.

22:03.256 --> 22:06.026
Better than the last time
I saw ya.

22:06.059 --> 22:09.162
- You must be Henry.
- Hey, Evan, how you doing?

22:09.196 --> 22:11.531
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.667
Eh, congratulations on
the Sandquist-Wells merger.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.403
Thank you.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.938
- I'm Cecilia.
- Evan.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.542
You are a lucky man, Nathan.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.712
So, uh, glasses, rocks?

22:25.745 --> 22:26.846
Anybody?
Who's up?

22:26.879 --> 22:29.949
- Not now.
- Maybe later.

22:29.983 --> 22:31.551
- I'll have a...
- Neat, right?

22:31.584 --> 22:32.719
Yeah.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.853
Hey, Nathan, I heard you're
in law school,

22:33.886 --> 22:35.788
How's that going?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.562
You know, sometimes,
Vanessa, I wish...

22:42.595 --> 22:45.565
What?
He's your son, stay out of it?

22:45.598 --> 22:46.799
Just say it, because if

22:46.833 --> 22:48.835
That's what you want to say,
say it!

22:52.105 --> 22:53.606
I just...

22:53.640 --> 22:56.043
I just want him
to have options.

22:58.078 --> 22:59.646
He has a degree.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.815
Yeah, a bachelor's...

23:03.983 --> 23:05.885
You know

23:05.918 --> 23:08.655
He needs an advanced degree.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.457
Kids these days
with bachelors,

23:10.490 --> 23:13.293
They're having a hard time
finding work.

23:13.326 --> 23:16.629
But he wants to start
his life with Cecilia.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.731
Don't you want to give
him a chance to do that?

23:18.765 --> 23:21.834
Yeah, but what's wrong with
waiting a couple of years?

23:23.170 --> 23:25.672
Don't you remember
what it was like

23:25.705 --> 23:27.674
When you were his age?

23:29.476 --> 23:31.678
Yeah...

23:31.711 --> 23:33.980
Yeah, I do.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.249
When I was
in graduate school.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.852
Cecilia's pregnant.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.926
She told you that?

23:47.860 --> 23:50.497
Look, I'm not supposed
to say anything.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.864
I promised her I wouldn't.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.801
But, I think considering
the circumstances...

23:54.834 --> 23:56.035
You should know.

23:56.069 --> 23:57.770
She told you
she was pregnant?

23:57.804 --> 23:59.339
Yeah.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.050
What's she gonna do?
Do you know?

24:11.084 --> 24:13.786
What do you mean?

24:13.820 --> 24:17.524
I mean, is she gonna keep it,
have an abortion, what?

24:17.557 --> 24:19.926
Henry, I don't, I don't know.
She didn't say.

24:21.361 --> 24:22.795
Fuck, man!

24:22.829 --> 24:24.831
That's all we need right now.

24:26.266 --> 24:28.901
Look, it's not the end
of the world.

24:28.935 --> 24:31.871
Look, I'm excited,
I think this is a good thing.

24:31.904 --> 24:32.872
Why?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.374
I think it'll be good
for Nathan

24:34.407 --> 24:36.809
Because if you introduce
a baby into the mix,

24:36.843 --> 24:39.246
He's not gonna have a choice,
he's gonna have to step up.

24:39.279 --> 24:40.880
You know some
of the greatest fortunes

24:40.913 --> 24:41.814
In the history
of the United States

24:41.848 --> 24:43.550
Were created
in the Great Depression

24:43.583 --> 24:45.318
Or in a panic.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.922
But, wait, if you invested
the money

24:49.956 --> 24:51.191
That your parents
gave you for school,

24:51.224 --> 24:53.726
How did you pay for school?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.728
Oh, I dropped out.

24:55.762 --> 24:58.765
Oh, my gosh!
Were your parents mad?

24:58.798 --> 25:00.333
Well, they didn't know.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.570
I just walked around
in the sweatshirt

25:03.603 --> 25:07.407
And then I talked about
the football team.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.109
My old man never suspected
a thing.

25:10.143 --> 25:12.579
So you lied to them.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.614
Well, that depends
on how you look at it.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.116
I like to think that
I was living my life

25:17.150 --> 25:20.353
The way that I wanted to, so,
in that sense,

25:20.387 --> 25:22.855
I was actually
being more truthful.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.159
Okay.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.963
I'm telling you
all my secrets.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.799
Now it's your turn.
You tell me one.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.133
I don't have any secrets.

25:34.167 --> 25:35.968
Oh, come on,
everyone has secrets.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.370
I don't.

25:37.404 --> 25:39.239
Umm...

25:39.272 --> 25:40.907
Let me guess...

25:43.176 --> 25:44.811
Another guy?

25:44.844 --> 25:47.046
What?
No!

25:47.079 --> 25:48.315
- Yeah.
- Why would you say that?

25:48.348 --> 25:49.782
I'm, I'm sorry,
I don't want to offend you,

25:49.816 --> 25:52.785
But, it's just something
that, I got the sense that,

25:52.819 --> 25:54.921
You know.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.789
Clearly you think
that you love Nathan,

25:56.823 --> 25:57.990
And I understand that,

25:58.024 --> 26:00.293
But you guys aren't exactly,
you know.

26:01.861 --> 26:02.829
No, I don't know.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.997
You guys aren't exactly
on the same page.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.266
What would make you say that?

26:06.299 --> 26:09.669
- Your body language.
- My body language?

26:09.702 --> 26:11.838
Well, our thoughts, they,

26:11.871 --> 26:14.407
Manifest into the way
that we move, you know,

26:14.441 --> 26:18.645
90 percent of communication
is nonverbal.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.280
I could tell a lot about
people here

26:20.313 --> 26:22.849
Just from what
I saw earlier.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.083
Like what?

26:25.652 --> 26:27.687
Well, like Nathan.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.057
He tries really hard
to be perfect.

26:32.225 --> 26:34.927
And he's an idealist,
but he's conflicted.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.866
Because his heart is telling
him that good guys win,

26:39.899 --> 26:41.934
But his mind has begun
to tell him that guys

26:41.968 --> 26:44.371
Like his father actually win.

26:44.404 --> 26:46.306
Guys like his father.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.674
What do you mean by that?

26:47.707 --> 26:50.710
Guys that take what they want
without apologizing for it.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.548
The things that people tell
you about themselves,

26:55.582 --> 26:59.051
That's really what they want
you to believe, right?

26:59.085 --> 27:01.120
The key is to watch the body,

27:01.153 --> 27:03.723
Because the body doesn't lie.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.527
What does my body say?

27:10.162 --> 27:12.865
Well, you're confident,

27:12.899 --> 27:14.233
But I think on the inside
you really feel

27:14.267 --> 27:17.003
Like you don't fit in.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.839
The way that you move.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.909
You probably studied dance
as a child.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.912
Which means that your parents
probably had money.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.547
Either that or they
sacrificed a lot

27:27.580 --> 27:29.916
To give you the things
that you needed.

27:31.117 --> 27:34.354
They were uh, hard workers.

27:34.387 --> 27:37.924
Good ethics,
emphasis on discipline.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.926
They didn't approve
of the way that you dressed

27:39.959 --> 27:41.561
Or the little tattoo
that you have on the inside

27:41.594 --> 27:43.530
Of your forearm, but you
didn't care because

27:43.563 --> 27:45.097
You were rebellious.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.266
You know, if Henry
met your parents,

27:47.300 --> 27:49.769
He would really like them.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.271
He would admire
their work ethic,

27:52.305 --> 27:56.743
But that's very unlikely
to happen any time soon.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.011
Henry barely
acknowledges you.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.012
Which means
one of two things.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.281
One, he's self-absorbed,

28:02.315 --> 28:06.819
Or two, he doesn't approve
of you, or both.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.857
But either way it makes you
really crave his approval.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.328
How am I doing?

28:17.464 --> 28:19.332
Pretty good,

28:20.400 --> 28:25.405
There's just one thing,
the dancing thing.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.640
It's bullshit because
I never danced.

28:28.975 --> 28:33.112
That tells me that you looked
at my profile online.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.948
It's fake,

28:35.982 --> 28:40.820
So, I know that you googled
me before you came here.

28:40.853 --> 28:44.090
Which means either you're
a creepy stalker guy,

28:44.123 --> 28:47.059
Or you have
some other agenda.

28:48.761 --> 28:52.965
You're handsome and you're
definitely confident,

28:52.999 --> 28:56.969
So, you don't need
to stalk anyone.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.071
So, I'm guessing that you
have something to sell Henry

28:59.105 --> 29:02.241
And you did your research
before you came here.

29:04.010 --> 29:08.114
Don't worry,
I'm not judging you.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.248
It's the smart thing to do.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.184
That's what I would
have done.

29:12.218 --> 29:15.488
How am I doing so far?

29:20.727 --> 29:21.928
You think I'm making
a mistake?

29:21.961 --> 29:23.195
What?

29:24.631 --> 29:26.265
Vanessa said you think
I'm making a mistake

29:26.298 --> 29:27.867
By not going to grad school.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.036
I didn't say that!

29:32.672 --> 29:36.008
I just wanna make sure that
you're not gonna regret this.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.043
Hey, look, it, it's okay.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.345
School, school's not
for everyone, alright?

29:39.378 --> 29:41.781
He's, I'm sure he has some
kind of business ideas

29:41.814 --> 29:43.883
Some other way that he'd like
to spend the money, right?

29:43.916 --> 29:47.286
No, actually I have no idea
what I wanna do.

29:48.521 --> 29:51.758
Well, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

29:57.664 --> 29:59.466
Vanessa, I didn't tell you

29:59.499 --> 30:03.069
That I thought that Nathan
was making a mistake.

30:03.102 --> 30:07.540
Right, well, what I meant
to say was... that was a sense

30:07.574 --> 30:09.175
That I got from you.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.243
Okay.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.311
Look.
This weekend is about

30:12.344 --> 30:13.412
Becki and Robert.

30:13.446 --> 30:17.950
Let's talk about all this
stuff later, okay?

30:19.085 --> 30:21.387
Yeah, okay.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.856
- Henry?
- Yeah, sure.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.058
Good, onto other things.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.660
Happy things.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.098
Uh, Henry, I was meaning
to ask you earlier.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.200
What, what are your thoughts
about renewable energy?

30:34.233 --> 30:35.267
Are you guys doing any work
with that?

30:35.301 --> 30:36.669
I'm gonna go take a nap.

30:36.703 --> 30:39.506
So far it's a lot of talk
with very little results.

30:39.539 --> 30:42.308
Well, that may change soon.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.078
They've developed
and kind of enhanced

30:46.112 --> 30:49.215
The photovoltaic cell,
which is the panel

30:49.248 --> 30:51.017
That converts sunlight
into electricity.

30:52.284 --> 30:55.287
They have come up with this,
uh, kind of accelerator

30:55.321 --> 30:58.290
That is going to multiply
the output by 10, maybe 12,

30:58.324 --> 31:00.359
Using half the surface area.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.728
Now, if this company
takes off,

31:01.761 --> 31:03.696
Like I know that it's going to,
I mean, imagine the,

31:03.730 --> 31:05.798
Imagine the size of that
market place.

31:05.832 --> 31:09.368
If this company takes off,
like you know it's going to?

31:09.401 --> 31:11.103
You know it's going to?

31:11.137 --> 31:12.739
I know it's going
to and there's more.

31:12.772 --> 31:14.106
How?

31:16.175 --> 31:18.778
I happen to know
about a certain bill.

31:18.811 --> 31:20.747
This bill is on its way
to passing in the Senate,

31:20.780 --> 31:22.314
It's being fast tracked.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.450
And it's going to be
extending large subsidies

31:24.483 --> 31:25.417
And huge tax credits to...

31:25.451 --> 31:27.587
How do you know
about that bill?

31:27.620 --> 31:30.122
I knew
something was going on with Cecilia.

31:30.156 --> 31:31.157
I, I just didn't know what.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.726
Jesus!

31:33.760 --> 31:35.962
How did you know?

31:35.995 --> 31:38.330
I overhead my dad
and Vanessa talking.

31:39.799 --> 31:43.169
I noticed some things, uh,
you're not drinking,

31:43.202 --> 31:46.138
You've been getting sick
in the mornings.

31:46.172 --> 31:49.776
Yeah, I'm pregnant.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.779
Are you sure?

31:52.812 --> 31:54.146
I'm sure.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.350
Henry and Vanessa know.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.587
Why didn't you tell me?

32:00.620 --> 32:04.123
I wasn't sure what
I was gonna do.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.092
Like you didn't know if you
were gonna keep it or not?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.426
Yeah.

32:08.394 --> 32:11.631
But, are you going
to keep it?

32:11.664 --> 32:13.900
I'm not getting an abortion!

32:16.202 --> 32:17.670
Good.

32:19.739 --> 32:21.073
That's good.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.776
I'm gonna be a dad.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.279
I told
everyone the good news.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.824
Well, Henry, you strike me
as a guy who likes

32:37.857 --> 32:39.826
A good scotch.
What do you think?

32:42.061 --> 32:43.362
It's good scotch.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.897
Real good scotch.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.368
What's the difference between
good scotch and bad scotch?

32:49.401 --> 32:52.204
Well, the main difference
is that some are blended

32:52.238 --> 32:53.405
And some are single malts.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.474
This is a blended malt.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.677
Which means that
it's blended from whiskeys

32:57.710 --> 32:59.679
From a couple
different distilleries.

32:59.712 --> 33:03.582
I think the character comes
from the blended malt.

33:03.616 --> 33:07.019
You know what goes good
with a blended malt?

33:07.053 --> 33:08.354
Good cigar?

33:08.387 --> 33:10.389
Yeah, I got a couple
of Cubans out in the car.

33:10.422 --> 33:14.326
You wanna grab the bottle
and uh, go have a talk?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.428
Absolutely.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.097
Lead the way.

33:18.130 --> 33:21.367
He knew how to
connect with Dad better than I ever did.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.272
How far along are you?
You never said.

33:26.305 --> 33:29.441
Oh, um, the doctor actually
couldn't really tell.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.778
Why?

33:31.811 --> 33:33.245
I guess the picture
on the ultrasound

33:33.279 --> 33:36.048
Wasn't real clear.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.884
I think it was just
his machine.

33:37.917 --> 33:40.352
At least next time you'll
have Nathan to go with you.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.690
Yeah, that'll be great.

33:45.157 --> 33:48.227
You sure it's mine?

33:48.260 --> 33:49.528
Yeah. I'm sure.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.334
Ah, fuck!

33:56.402 --> 33:59.538
Um... okay, well,

34:01.007 --> 34:02.742
How do you wanna deal
with it?

34:02.775 --> 34:04.376
I did a pretty thorough
phone search

34:04.410 --> 34:06.645
And I found
nothing incriminating.

34:06.679 --> 34:08.947
What's the deal
with that anyway?

34:08.981 --> 34:10.449
Are you kidding?

34:10.482 --> 34:12.384
The phone is the best way
to find out

34:12.418 --> 34:13.418
If a man is cheating.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.587
There was something there.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.289
You know?

34:17.322 --> 34:19.190
- What, between us?
- Yeah.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.128
Yeah, I know,
I know there was.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.130
- Yeah.
- That was good.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.431
I know,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.335
So, do you think we could...

34:31.337 --> 34:33.639
You know, try?

34:34.873 --> 34:36.507
Yeah, I know we talked
about that before.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.476
That's fine, but we gotta,

34:38.510 --> 34:41.679
Like, we gotta get the deal
handled with the baby,

34:41.714 --> 34:45.317
I mean we just like keep, you
know, really, like an abortion

34:45.351 --> 34:47.152
Or something, you know.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.286
An abortion?

34:48.320 --> 34:50.156
Yeah, you can do that, right?

34:50.188 --> 34:51.958
No.

34:51.991 --> 34:53.125
- No?
- No.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.159
Why not?

34:54.193 --> 34:56.027
I'm not getting
a fucking abortion!

34:56.062 --> 34:57.163
Wait, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.664
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why not?

34:58.697 --> 35:01.533
I've never cheated,
but I feel like, I don't know,

35:01.567 --> 35:04.436
A guy would at least delete
the evidence or something.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.272
You can't, it's impossible.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.506
You can't!

35:07.539 --> 35:11.043
You can't have this baby!

35:11.077 --> 35:13.112
You can't, you can't do it.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.381
Do you understand what that
would do to me?

35:15.414 --> 35:16.515
Do you understand...

35:16.548 --> 35:17.817
- No.
- What that would do

35:17.850 --> 35:20.119
To my relationship
with my son

35:20.152 --> 35:21.353
And my girlfriend?

35:21.387 --> 35:23.455
Why do you even give a fuck
about them anyway?

35:23.489 --> 35:25.191
I...
uh...

35:25.224 --> 35:27.226
Maybe it's because
you never cheated before,

35:27.259 --> 35:30.029
But, there's
evidence everywhere.

35:30.062 --> 35:33.332
Phone numbers called,
numbers received,

35:33.365 --> 35:35.401
Pictures, text messages,

35:35.434 --> 35:37.970
Plus, once you have
his phone,

35:38.004 --> 35:41.173
You can call whoever you
suspect he's cheating with

35:41.207 --> 35:43.542
And as soon as she answers
the phone

35:43.575 --> 35:45.577
You know for sure if they're
screwing or not.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.213
Why can't you have
an abortion?

35:47.246 --> 35:48.480
Why can't you have
an abortion?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.216
Because I wanna have this
baby, and you know why?

35:50.249 --> 35:51.317
- What?
- I wanna have it with you!

35:51.350 --> 35:53.585
Why?

35:53.619 --> 35:56.022
I don't want it.

35:56.055 --> 35:59.425
I don't fucking
want it, okay?

35:59.458 --> 36:02.028
- You still want it?
- Yeah.

36:02.061 --> 36:03.930
You know what?
I don't fucking need this.

36:03.963 --> 36:05.998
Don't you fucking walk
out of here!

36:10.702 --> 36:12.304
- You know what?
- What?

36:13.305 --> 36:16.042
What? What?
What? What? What?

36:16.075 --> 36:17.844
You wanna know when I can
drop that bomb?

36:17.877 --> 36:19.879
I can drop that bomb
whenever I want.

36:19.912 --> 36:21.680
So my suggestion is that
you pay me

36:21.713 --> 36:23.049
A little fucking respect!

36:23.983 --> 36:25.451
Just by the way she answers
the phone?

36:25.484 --> 36:27.586
Just by the way
she answers the phone

36:27.619 --> 36:29.421
When she sees his number.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.257
There's something that
happened between us.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.025
- You just acknowledged that.
- Yeah.

36:33.059 --> 36:35.461
Why are you fighting
this so much?

36:35.494 --> 36:38.697
We can be good,

36:38.730 --> 36:39.866
We can be good.

36:39.899 --> 36:41.100
This is crazy.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.035
This is fucking crazy.

36:43.069 --> 36:44.904
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

36:44.937 --> 36:49.208
No, I'm finally thinking
clearly is what's happening.

36:49.241 --> 36:52.111
I all along have been dating
Nathan when I'm realizing

36:52.144 --> 36:54.546
That all I wanted
all along was you.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.150
You're what I want.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.090
Hey, just uh,
don't say anything.

37:04.123 --> 37:05.624
Why?
What's going on?

37:05.657 --> 37:10.762
Six weeks ago I was home
at my mom's for Christmas.

37:10.796 --> 37:15.067
Well, she said
almost six weeks, so...

37:15.101 --> 37:17.636
Yeah, I'm sure it's alright.

37:17.669 --> 37:18.837
You didn't seem to think

37:18.871 --> 37:21.207
That it was such
a bad idea that night.

37:23.475 --> 37:28.347
No... no, I didn't.

37:32.284 --> 37:35.521
It's the best thing that's
happened to me in two years.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.395
Me, too.

37:45.331 --> 37:46.765
I really didn't
see it coming.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.335
Becki went through men
like water.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.769
Oh, come on,
you shouldn't be surprised.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.138
It's in a woman's DNA.

37:52.171 --> 37:54.306
What?
What's that suppose to mean?

37:54.340 --> 37:55.674
Well, you've done it now.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.543
Well, come on,
we all know Becki

37:57.576 --> 38:01.213
And even she's falling victim
to the urge to nest.

38:01.247 --> 38:03.482
What's wrong with nesting?

38:03.515 --> 38:07.186
That's nice,
listen to me, Nathan,

38:07.219 --> 38:11.690
Women fake orgasms
to have relationships,

38:11.723 --> 38:15.995
Men fake relationships
to have orgasms.

38:16.028 --> 38:18.730
Please do not tell me that
you believe the bullshit

38:18.764 --> 38:19.865
You're saying right now?

38:19.898 --> 38:21.033
Yeah, dude,
don't talk for me.

38:22.234 --> 38:23.369
What, are you telling me that
you don't think

38:23.402 --> 38:24.370
That sex is different
for a man

38:24.403 --> 38:25.737
Than it is for a woman?
Come on.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.239
Okay, I'll admit,

38:27.273 --> 38:29.141
Biologically, men are driven
more by sex than women are.

38:29.175 --> 38:30.376
Well, exactly,
that's my point.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.877
That's what I'm trying
to say. Let me finish.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.981
What I'm saying is,
after all is said and done,

38:35.014 --> 38:36.582
We still have
a consciousness.

38:36.615 --> 38:41.387
I mean and, and that allows
us to rise above those banal

38:41.420 --> 38:44.923
Needs and wants and,
I mean, plus, hello,

38:44.957 --> 38:47.259
Your sister
is getting married.

38:49.595 --> 38:50.762
Alright, Vanessa,
you're right.

38:50.796 --> 38:54.500
- Thank you.
- Nathan, don't listen to me.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.268
I just went through a bad
breakup this year

38:56.302 --> 38:57.769
And it's just a...

38:57.803 --> 38:59.271
A broken heart talking.

38:59.305 --> 39:01.240
What happened?

39:04.443 --> 39:06.745
You know, I met this girl,
I thought she was the one,

39:06.778 --> 39:08.280
She was amazing.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.017
And it was hard for me
to open up

39:11.050 --> 39:13.452
And then when I finally
committed, then uh...

39:16.222 --> 39:18.590
Let's just say
that I regret it.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.727
But you can't
give up on love,

39:21.760 --> 39:24.696
Just because one girl
was awful.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.765
Nathan, you're about
to be a parent.

39:26.798 --> 39:27.899
How's that feel?

39:27.933 --> 39:31.070
Scary.

39:31.103 --> 39:32.704
Why?

39:33.939 --> 39:36.342
It's crazy, I mean...

39:37.743 --> 39:40.446
What if I screw up?

39:40.479 --> 39:44.550
Nathan, you are going
to be an amazing dad.

39:46.452 --> 39:48.720
Everybody probably felt
that way, right?

40:04.803 --> 40:09.108
Hey, everything okay?

40:09.141 --> 40:11.177
Yeah, I'm just tired.

40:59.191 --> 41:01.026
Vanessa was right.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.329
You can learn a lot looking
through someone's phone.

41:03.362 --> 41:05.631
- That's weird.
- What?

41:05.664 --> 41:07.065
What's weird?

41:07.099 --> 41:09.735
Why do you have
Cecilia's phone?

41:09.768 --> 41:12.438
Why was Cecilia calling you?

41:14.206 --> 41:15.807
Dad!

41:15.841 --> 41:17.776
Why was Cecilia calling you?

41:20.546 --> 41:23.382
Uh, she said uh,
she needed to talk to me.

41:23.415 --> 41:24.816
About what?

41:26.618 --> 41:28.154
Uh...

41:28.187 --> 41:29.855
You knew?

41:29.888 --> 41:30.889
Knew what?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.824
I'm gonna talk to Cecilia.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.397
Whoa, what am I,
what am I missing?

41:40.532 --> 41:42.901
You and I
should probably talk.

41:45.971 --> 41:49.741
I don't understand.
She went to see you?

41:49.775 --> 41:53.179
She was worried about Nathan.

41:53.212 --> 41:54.746
Why?

41:54.780 --> 41:57.683
- Because of school?
- Yeah.

41:59.151 --> 42:01.387
That's strange.

42:01.420 --> 42:02.754
Why is that strange?

42:02.788 --> 42:06.192
Because it's not her concern.

42:08.560 --> 42:11.763
She was... worried about him
dropping out of school.

42:11.797 --> 42:13.199
What's wrong with that?

42:13.232 --> 42:14.766
No, but worrying
wasn't wrong.

42:14.800 --> 42:18.937
Going to see you,
behind Nathan's back, is.

42:18.970 --> 42:22.140
She said she needed
to talk to me.

42:22.174 --> 42:24.476
What was I supposed to do?

42:24.510 --> 42:28.214
Okay, whatever,
so what's the big deal?

42:29.815 --> 42:35.087
We talked about eh, about
Nathan and school, and um...

42:36.121 --> 42:37.789
- And what?
- Look, um...

42:37.823 --> 42:39.658
Henry?

42:39.691 --> 42:42.027
Apparently there's a...

42:44.095 --> 42:45.063
There's another guy.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.865
There's another guy.

42:47.999 --> 42:50.269
She's cheated?

42:50.302 --> 42:53.305
On Nathan?
She told you that?

42:55.707 --> 43:00.279
Kind, in a way, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I mean, yes, yes.

43:00.312 --> 43:02.648
Oh, my God,
he's gonna be devastated.

43:03.882 --> 43:06.685
I don't... really...

43:08.220 --> 43:10.722
Know what
the circumstances were.

43:14.326 --> 43:15.927
Should we tell him?

43:15.961 --> 43:16.995
No, no, no.

43:17.028 --> 43:18.930
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

43:18.964 --> 43:21.099
It's uh, it's not our place.

43:21.132 --> 43:25.637
There's something about that
girl I have never trusted.

43:25.671 --> 43:28.039
He loves her so much.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.776
How could she do that to him?

43:31.877 --> 43:33.879
I don't know, Vanessa.

43:36.014 --> 43:37.583
I can't do this anymore.

43:43.054 --> 43:44.890
There's someone else.

43:46.558 --> 43:49.695
Someone else, what do you
mean someone else?

43:49.728 --> 43:52.564
There was a guy.

43:52.598 --> 43:54.065
Guy?
What guy?

43:54.099 --> 43:56.001
Just a guy.

43:56.034 --> 43:57.603
What happened?

43:59.771 --> 44:02.040
We had both been drinking,
we were very drunk,

44:02.073 --> 44:03.975
Especially him.

44:04.009 --> 44:05.977
And?

44:06.011 --> 44:09.315
And he got aggressive.

44:09.348 --> 44:12.217
And he forced himself on you?

44:14.853 --> 44:17.222
- What happened?
- What do you think?

44:17.255 --> 44:20.892
Did you have sex?

44:20.926 --> 44:22.894
Oh, my God!

44:30.569 --> 44:31.770
Whoa!

44:31.803 --> 44:32.904
An abortion?

44:32.938 --> 44:36.107
No, no, no, no, I didn't mean
like suggest it.

44:36.141 --> 44:38.910
I'm just telling you like
whatever that she wants,

44:38.944 --> 44:42.113
Just, you know, whatever
she decides, you know,

44:42.147 --> 44:44.082
I'm just saying if she,
you know, like,

44:44.115 --> 44:45.351
If you just get the idea that

44:45.384 --> 44:47.285
Maybe she's going
one way or the other,

44:47.319 --> 44:48.286
Just go with it, alright?

44:48.320 --> 44:49.355
No, no, no.

44:49.388 --> 44:51.122
I'm not gonna
suggest it, Henry.

44:51.156 --> 44:53.191
I'm not saying, don't,
I'm not saying suggest it,

44:53.224 --> 44:55.126
I'm just like, whatever,
let's just find out

44:55.160 --> 44:57.463
Where she's at, alright?

44:57.496 --> 44:59.130
Alright?
Maybe she's like,

44:59.164 --> 45:01.132
If she wants to go there,
you know, then we,

45:01.166 --> 45:03.735
Like I'll pay, we'll take
care of everything.

45:03.769 --> 45:05.537
Alright?

45:05.571 --> 45:07.072
Okay?

45:07.673 --> 45:09.274
Nathan?

45:10.175 --> 45:11.810
I'm not mad.

45:11.843 --> 45:12.878
I was hurt.

45:12.911 --> 45:13.945
You're not?

45:13.979 --> 45:15.547
But everyone makes mistakes.

45:15.581 --> 45:17.082
So you forgave her.

45:17.115 --> 45:19.951
Yeah, we worked it out.

46:09.034 --> 46:11.102
There's a big opportunity
right here to get

46:11.136 --> 46:12.971
Into the ground floor
before this takes off.

46:13.004 --> 46:15.140
Company like yours, we,
we're gonna just raise

46:15.173 --> 46:16.608
One more round
of seed capital.

46:16.642 --> 46:18.109
You can take a position now.

46:18.143 --> 46:21.212
- You know what I think?
- What?

46:21.246 --> 46:23.181
I think I need another drink.

46:31.189 --> 46:34.292
He's not having the,
the best day, I'm sorry.

46:35.694 --> 46:37.896
He's not really been
himself today.

46:37.929 --> 46:41.633
Yeah, I know he's got
a lot of exposure

46:41.667 --> 46:42.668
In Europe right now,

46:42.701 --> 46:46.037
The fucking EU
is upside-down.

46:46.071 --> 46:47.405
The guy probably
needs a hit, right?

46:47.439 --> 46:49.274
- Just like all of us.
- Yeah.

46:52.110 --> 46:54.546
I was serious about what
I said to you earlier.

46:54.580 --> 46:57.315
- What?
- You look really good.

46:57.348 --> 46:58.817
Oh, that.

46:58.850 --> 47:00.519
You look better than
the last time I saw you.

47:00.552 --> 47:02.220
It's like you just...

47:02.253 --> 47:03.354
I don't know,
I guess you must be

47:03.388 --> 47:07.358
In a really good place.
Yeah, we're good.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.562
I can't believe
I'm gonna be a dad.

47:13.231 --> 47:15.433
What if I'm not good at it?

47:15.467 --> 47:17.503
What would make
you think that?

47:17.536 --> 47:20.438
Have you met my dad?

47:20.472 --> 47:21.439
You know it's funny,

47:21.473 --> 47:23.709
I was down at
the boat house earlier.

47:23.742 --> 47:24.710
Do you remember
the boat house?

47:24.743 --> 47:28.079
Oh, God!
Making out in the boat house.

47:28.113 --> 47:31.116
- How high school was?
- That was not high school.

47:31.149 --> 47:32.784
You know what I mean.

47:34.319 --> 47:35.887
I never told Becki
about that.

47:35.921 --> 47:38.089
- Did you tell Becki?
- No, are you kidding?

47:38.123 --> 47:39.124
I'm the only
one of her friends

47:39.157 --> 47:40.458
She thinks never hooked
up with you.

47:40.492 --> 47:41.593
She always says that.

47:41.627 --> 47:43.695
I did not hook up with
all of her friends.

47:43.729 --> 47:44.696
Uh-huh.

47:44.730 --> 47:47.365
Look, and with you
it was different.

47:47.398 --> 47:50.001
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:51.336 --> 47:54.940
I had the biggest crush
on you for the longest time.

47:54.973 --> 47:56.808
Are you serious?

47:56.842 --> 47:58.109
You don't believe me.

47:58.143 --> 47:59.811
No, I don't believe you.

47:59.845 --> 48:02.313
Why do you think
I went to UCLA?

48:02.347 --> 48:05.283
Because their MBA program
is one of the top 20

48:05.316 --> 48:07.318
Universities of the world.

48:07.352 --> 48:11.723
No, I went to UCLA because
you were Pre-Med there.

48:11.757 --> 48:13.158
You never said anything.

48:13.191 --> 48:15.026
Because I was intimidated.

48:16.494 --> 48:19.130
You were always going out
with these older guys, right?

48:19.164 --> 48:20.932
What, what was his name,
that uh...

48:20.966 --> 48:22.333
- Sam?
- Yeah.

48:22.367 --> 48:24.235
The marathon runner?

48:25.637 --> 48:27.272
I don't know, I was shy.

48:27.305 --> 48:30.008
Okay, now I know you're lying
because you, my friend,

48:30.041 --> 48:31.810
Were never shy with girls.

48:31.843 --> 48:33.612
No, no, I was never
shy with girls

48:33.645 --> 48:35.046
That I didn't care about.

48:37.182 --> 48:38.917
I mean, look, there's nothing
at stake, right?

48:38.950 --> 48:40.786
There's nothing to lose,
so it's easy to be bold,

48:40.819 --> 48:43.388
But when you care about
a girl, right?

48:44.823 --> 48:47.192
If you're in love with her.

48:47.225 --> 48:50.996
No, I'm, I'm putting myself
out there, that's something

48:51.029 --> 48:52.831
That I'm, I'm risking, right?

48:52.864 --> 48:57.603
I mean... broken heart.

48:57.636 --> 48:59.638
I guess I just figured that
if, if you never show

48:59.671 --> 49:00.939
Your hand, then, you know,

49:00.972 --> 49:03.809
At least you have
hope, right?

49:03.842 --> 49:07.045
You have the, the fantasy
that maybe some day things

49:07.078 --> 49:12.250
Might work out right,
if the timing were right.

49:13.685 --> 49:15.654
Come on!

49:15.687 --> 49:17.455
Look, you, you wonder why
I never said anything.

49:17.488 --> 49:19.457
Clearly, this is why
I never said anything.

49:19.490 --> 49:21.226
I'm trying to open up
to you here,

49:21.259 --> 49:24.062
I'm just trying to be honest,
you know?

49:27.866 --> 49:29.534
That's cool, cheers.

49:32.570 --> 49:38.309
Henry and I want you to know
that uh, we're here for you.

49:38.343 --> 49:39.745
Both of you.

49:41.112 --> 49:43.181
Thanks.

49:43.214 --> 49:45.583
And I realize that I'm not
that much older than you,

49:45.617 --> 49:48.887
And, Nathan, I'm in no way
trying to be your mom,

49:48.920 --> 49:54.359
Or even your step mom, but,
I do like the idea of family,

49:54.392 --> 49:57.395
Of us being a family.

49:57.428 --> 49:58.730
Thanks.

50:01.733 --> 50:05.070
And I realize that
we are also not very...

50:05.103 --> 50:07.438
- Conventional?
- Conventional, right.

50:07.472 --> 50:09.708
Traditional, functional,
whatever.

50:09.741 --> 50:11.009
Look, I'm not one of those

50:11.042 --> 50:13.544
"Always look on the bright
side" kind of women.

50:13.578 --> 50:17.048
In fact, people like that
bug the shit out of me,

50:17.082 --> 50:19.751
When you live with
someone who constantly lies to you,

50:19.785 --> 50:22.453
You start lying to yourself.

50:22.487 --> 50:25.390
And we have to make
the best of what we've got,

50:25.423 --> 50:28.593
And, you do the best
you can in life.

50:30.495 --> 50:34.099
I guess that's what I'm
trying to say.

50:36.601 --> 50:39.938
Uh... get me another scotch.

50:39.971 --> 50:41.873
- I think we're out.
- Mmmm.

50:41.907 --> 50:43.474
Want me to make
something else?

50:43.508 --> 50:46.177
Uh, no...
That's alright.

50:49.748 --> 50:50.882
Hey.

50:50.916 --> 50:52.818
I'm gonna go,
I'm gonna go make a call.

50:54.986 --> 50:57.422
- How you doing?
- Fine.

51:00.025 --> 51:01.326
You're drunk.

51:02.427 --> 51:04.329
Yeah, a little.

51:08.199 --> 51:09.735
Did uh...

51:09.768 --> 51:11.502
Did you guys talk?

51:14.005 --> 51:16.207
- We did.
- And?

51:17.275 --> 51:18.977
She told me everything.

51:20.712 --> 51:23.348
She told you everything?

51:23.381 --> 51:25.751
I mean, about the baby?

51:25.784 --> 51:29.087
Yes, about the baby.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.989
I know what happened.

51:32.523 --> 51:33.691
Really?

51:33.725 --> 51:35.460
What'd she say?

51:36.361 --> 51:38.864
You and I both know,
you already know.

51:40.365 --> 51:42.200
She told, she, she told...

51:42.233 --> 51:44.135
She told me about
the other guy.

51:45.904 --> 51:47.505
Oh, good.

51:47.538 --> 51:51.810
I'm not mad at her.
I forgive her, I love her.

51:51.843 --> 51:54.612
It's my baby, even if we
don't have the same DNA.

51:56.047 --> 51:57.282
Oh, that's...

52:00.018 --> 52:01.386
That's good, man,
I'm really proud of you,

52:01.419 --> 52:03.654
That's really good.

52:03.688 --> 52:05.957
Yeah, I, I know you
already know.

52:05.991 --> 52:08.393
I know, you know,
she showed up upset and I...

52:08.426 --> 52:10.161
She showed up?

52:10.195 --> 52:11.997
What are you talking about?

52:13.198 --> 52:14.665
That weekend,
when she came by.

52:14.699 --> 52:16.301
She was upset.

52:16.334 --> 52:17.368
She called you.

52:17.402 --> 52:18.536
I saw it on her phone.
She called you.

52:18.569 --> 52:20.806
Two weeks ago,
she called you.

52:20.839 --> 52:23.741
Right.

52:23.775 --> 52:26.244
When did she go to see you?

52:26.277 --> 52:28.980
Uh... she came by and,
and we talked.

52:29.014 --> 52:31.149
She was, she was upset,
so we talked.

52:31.182 --> 52:33.218
Oh, my God!

52:33.251 --> 52:36.654
She came over when I
was away for Christmas.

52:36.687 --> 52:39.757
Wait a minute now.
Wait a minute, Nathan.

52:39.791 --> 52:42.393
Don't call me Nathan!

52:42.427 --> 52:43.594
Were you drunk?

52:43.628 --> 52:45.730
Did she tell you who
the other guy was?!

52:45.763 --> 52:47.933
- Hold on, man, slow down.
- No!

52:47.966 --> 52:50.768
I don't think I will!
Were you drinking?

52:50.802 --> 52:53.204
Yeah, I might have,
I-I-I-I might have had

52:53.238 --> 52:55.206
Something to drink,
but I, I, I, I,

52:55.240 --> 52:56.407
What, what's wrong with that?

52:56.441 --> 52:57.943
Did you fuck my girlfriend?

52:57.976 --> 52:59.577
No, Nathan, I didn't fuck
your girlfriend!

52:59.610 --> 53:03.081
- Did you fuck my girlfriend?
- No!

53:03.114 --> 53:06.051
- Aaaah!
- God damnit!

53:06.084 --> 53:07.352
What the fuck, Dad?

53:07.385 --> 53:08.619
What the fuck?

53:08.653 --> 53:10.021
How could you do that?

53:10.055 --> 53:11.222
What?

53:11.256 --> 53:12.924
You, motherfucker!

53:12.958 --> 53:14.860
No!

53:14.893 --> 53:17.595
- Oh, my God!
- No!

53:17.628 --> 53:19.464
Why?
Why, motherfucker?

53:19.497 --> 53:21.066
Why did you do that?

53:21.099 --> 53:22.300
Nathan! Nathan!
Nathan! Stop!

53:22.333 --> 53:23.468
Stop!
Stop!

53:23.501 --> 53:24.535
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

53:24.569 --> 53:25.470
- Calm down.
- Fucking disgusting, man!

53:25.503 --> 53:26.471
Oh, oh!

53:26.504 --> 53:28.506
Oh, my God!

53:31.476 --> 53:33.611
What the hell happened?

53:34.579 --> 53:36.614
- You stay out of this.
- What did I do?

53:36.647 --> 53:39.250
You didn't do anything.
Just stay out of it!

53:41.452 --> 53:42.921
I just can't be around
this anymore,

53:42.954 --> 53:46.324
So I have to um,
you know.

53:46.357 --> 53:48.659
Would someone please
goddamn explain

53:48.693 --> 53:50.128
What is going
on here?

53:50.161 --> 53:53.331
I told you to stay out of it!

53:53.364 --> 53:54.765
I have to leave, okay?

53:54.799 --> 53:57.268
- How?
- I'll walk.

53:57.302 --> 53:58.636
No.
You aren't going anywhere.

53:58.669 --> 54:02.273
It's 12 miles in the fucking
rain, you aren't walking!

54:02.307 --> 54:04.142
Fuck!

54:05.510 --> 54:06.611
Yeah.

54:06.644 --> 54:08.679
Explain please!

54:10.982 --> 54:13.551
What did you do, Henry?

54:19.690 --> 54:22.527
Cecilia slept with my dad.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.096
Henry?
You fucked her?!

54:25.130 --> 54:28.666
- Listen, honey, I...
- Don't fucking touch me!

54:28.699 --> 54:32.337
Everybody just
calm down, alright?

54:32.370 --> 54:34.172
Now we're all stuck here
for the time being,

54:34.205 --> 54:36.541
So everybody just take
a breath.

54:44.182 --> 54:45.883
I was drunk.

54:45.917 --> 54:48.987
It never would have happened
if I hadn't been so drunk.

54:49.020 --> 54:51.456
Hm, so you do remember.

54:53.191 --> 54:54.692
Did you know that
I called that night

54:54.725 --> 54:57.162
Because I couldn't get
you on the phone?

54:57.195 --> 55:01.799
He was trying to reassure me
that everything was okay.

55:01.832 --> 55:05.136
Meanwhile you were
fucking Cecilia.

55:05.170 --> 55:07.538
And what about you?

55:07.572 --> 55:10.475
You let me go on and on about
how great it was

55:10.508 --> 55:12.677
That you were having a baby.

55:12.710 --> 55:14.745
Were you ever gonna tell me?

55:15.913 --> 55:18.549
Were you ever gonna bring
little Henry Jr.

55:18.583 --> 55:20.151
Into the world and let
everyone think

55:20.185 --> 55:22.653
It was Nathan's kid?

55:22.687 --> 55:24.555
Why the hell would you even
have the baby?

55:24.589 --> 55:26.424
You know what?
Fuck you!

55:26.457 --> 55:28.859
Don't you dare judge me.
You don't know me.

55:28.893 --> 55:31.362
You don't know anything
about this situation.

55:31.396 --> 55:33.831
All you do is just live
in your happy, happy land

55:33.864 --> 55:35.600
Where everything is okay
all the time

55:35.633 --> 55:37.668
And you don't have
to do anything.

55:37.702 --> 55:39.604
You have never had to work
for a single thing

55:39.637 --> 55:40.571
In your life!

55:40.605 --> 55:42.273
Fuck you!

55:42.307 --> 55:43.674
Okay.
You fucking,

55:43.708 --> 55:46.777
No fuck you, asshole.
Don't touch me.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.549
Nice try, Dad.

55:51.582 --> 55:53.684
You know what?
You shut up, too.

55:53.718 --> 55:54.852
You're just always talking

55:54.885 --> 55:56.954
With this clever
fucking sarcasm.

55:56.988 --> 55:58.756
Do you really think that
you're that much smarter

55:58.789 --> 56:01.192
Than everyone else?
Huh?

56:01.226 --> 56:03.194
Mister "I'm not gonna
go to grad school"

56:03.228 --> 56:04.729
Just because my dad's
paying for it

56:04.762 --> 56:06.764
And I wanna spite him. "

56:06.797 --> 56:09.367
You take his money,
you buy nice things

56:09.400 --> 56:10.601
And then you put him down.

56:10.635 --> 56:13.838
Well, at least he's done
something with his life!

56:16.474 --> 56:18.776
Fuck you all!

56:24.449 --> 56:25.716
You know what?
You weren't there,

56:25.750 --> 56:26.651
You don't understand.

56:26.684 --> 56:29.087
I'm trying to understand!

56:29.120 --> 56:31.389
He started kissing me!

56:31.422 --> 56:32.557
I was stunned,

56:32.590 --> 56:34.725
I couldn't believe he would
do something like that!

56:34.759 --> 56:36.594
Why didn't you stop him?

56:36.627 --> 56:38.763
The fact that I
tried to reason with her was insane.

56:38.796 --> 56:41.299
I don't know.
Maybe I felt safe.

56:41.332 --> 56:43.401
Maybe I felt wanted.

56:43.434 --> 56:44.469
Maybe I felt like
he was someone

56:44.502 --> 56:46.604
Who would take care of me.

56:46.637 --> 56:49.006
You could have said "no. "

56:49.040 --> 56:51.109
Fuck you.

57:02.120 --> 57:03.754
Pour you a drink?

57:13.731 --> 57:15.366
Okay, listen, I...

57:18.803 --> 57:21.072
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

57:23.174 --> 57:27.412
So, I just wanted you to know
that I am sorry.

57:31.482 --> 57:32.917
I'm sorry too.

57:35.320 --> 57:39.457
Forgive me for what I said
about the baby.

57:39.490 --> 57:41.058
That was cruel.

57:42.893 --> 57:44.929
Please.

57:46.764 --> 57:49.700
I shouldn't be surprised.

57:49.734 --> 57:52.737
Henry's very charming.

57:52.770 --> 57:55.740
Especially to a girl
who has daddy issues.

57:58.075 --> 58:00.711
You're talking
about me or you?

58:00.745 --> 58:02.147
Hm.

58:03.414 --> 58:07.185
Henry and I uh... we're
trying to get pregnant.

58:07.218 --> 58:09.720
I made it six weeks.

58:09.754 --> 58:12.323
You lost it?

58:12.357 --> 58:15.726
I thought it was because
Henry was old,

58:15.760 --> 58:18.129
But, apparently that's not
the problem.

58:21.399 --> 58:23.768
Well, the rain's
let up a bit.

58:23.801 --> 58:25.736
They should open
the road soon.

58:31.942 --> 58:34.145
I'm going to take my chances.

58:35.946 --> 58:38.783
That was
it. I never saw her again.

58:51.796 --> 58:53.364
How you doing?

58:55.633 --> 58:56.867
God!

58:58.236 --> 59:00.805
It hurts, you know?

59:02.307 --> 59:05.210
I just keep wanting
to go back a few hours.

59:05.243 --> 59:07.445
Just not ask Cecilia about
the pregnancy.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.582
Why?

59:11.616 --> 59:12.717
Hm?

59:13.618 --> 59:15.720
You wanna live a lie?

59:18.856 --> 59:20.891
I don't know
if that's so bad.

59:22.026 --> 59:25.896
I mean you said it yourself,
living with a fantasy.

59:25.930 --> 59:28.666
Fantasies leave you cold
at night, Vanessa.

59:30.100 --> 59:32.036
Take it from me.

59:38.008 --> 59:40.711
God, Nathan, I'm so sorry.

59:45.316 --> 59:47.151
Thanks.

59:49.720 --> 59:52.423
I feel like somehow I should
have seen this coming.

59:54.058 --> 59:56.160
Normal people don't expect
things like this, Nathan,

59:56.193 --> 59:58.996
Because normal people don't
behave this way.

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:03.934
Yeah, you're right.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:08.172
I think I'm gonna
go for a walk.

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:10.107
Do you
want me to go with you?

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.478
I think I need to do
this on my own.

01:00:13.511 --> 01:00:16.113
I was hurt, so angry.

01:00:21.686 --> 01:00:25.022
Um... I wanted to talk to you.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:30.829
Uh, I'd uh, I'm still uh,
drunk, and um,

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.898
I wanted to make sure...

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:41.071
I said some things to you,
so I wrote 'em down here.

01:00:44.509 --> 01:00:47.077
And I'm, um, uh...

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:52.117
I just wanted to say, how
sorry I am, for my behavior.

01:00:54.519 --> 01:00:58.088
And, uh, I'm not gonna stay
for the wedding.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:02.693
Instead I'm, I'm gonna
check myself into a drug

01:01:02.727 --> 01:01:08.098
And alcohol
rehabilitation center.

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:13.170
And uh, with hard work
and determination,

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:18.075
I, I hope to earn the trust
of the people who mean

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:20.144
The, the most to me.

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.780
That's it.

01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:27.518
I'll never
forget the last thing I said to him.

01:01:27.552 --> 01:01:29.019
Have a nice fucking life.

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:32.022
He never made it to rehab.

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:34.925
Twenty years later, he put
the barrel of a.45

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:37.528
To his head.
Took his own life.

01:01:41.799 --> 01:01:43.801
- Hi, you must be Nathan.
- Yeah.

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:46.136
In the back of my
mind I always though I'd see him again.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.705
Hi. Carla.

01:01:47.738 --> 01:01:49.407
Instead, I'm
sitting in the lawyers' office

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.809
Waiting for them
to read his will.

01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:53.143
Okay.

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:01.986
- Hm.
- Hi, I got Nathan here.

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:03.854
Great.

01:02:22.807 --> 01:02:25.476
Today I'm meeting
my brother for the first time.

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:27.077
I'm Nathan.

01:02:27.812 --> 01:02:29.246
Dillon.

01:02:33.384 --> 01:02:36.186
It's nice to finally
meet you.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.722
You, too.

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:41.025
I guess life
doesn't care about the stories

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:42.427
We tell ourselves.

01:02:49.033 --> 01:02:52.837
"My Love"]
