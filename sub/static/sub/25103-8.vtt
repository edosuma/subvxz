[narrator]
Previously on Queen Sugar...

00:02.870 --> 00:04.497
After True died,
your daddy started to wonder

00:04.540 --> 00:08.089
-if it was all worth it.
-I dont understand.

00:08.130 --> 00:10.963
Your father was wandering
the field with a gun that night.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.079
We need a schedule.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.291
You act like Im trying
to keep him from you.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.580
[Darla]
Who was she?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.505
Your love story doesnt have
to be over, Charley.

00:17.560 --> 00:21.178
Im going to pitch to Rawlings
my own pie shop.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.221
This here is our country,
black bitch.

00:23.270 --> 00:26.103
-E_xcuse_ me?
-Say It again, dude.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.106
The Landrys are working
with the government

00:28.150 --> 00:30.778
to build a private jail here.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.735
Hello?

00:36.700 --> 00:39.533
Just got home from church.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.445
Sorry I didnt call first.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.286
I just wanted to stop by

00:43.330 --> 00:46.242
and check on how
the move was going.

00:46.290 --> 00:47.996
Doing fine.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.339
Matter of fact, Im about
to have brunch with Vi.

00:51.380 --> 00:54.872
It looks like you still have
a fair amount of packing to do.

00:54.930 --> 00:59.629
Well, Im moving a little slow
these days.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.672
But youre supposed
to be out today.

01:02.730 --> 01:07.224
Why didnt you say something?
We couldve come over.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.106
[sighs]

01:09.150 --> 01:11.778
Another notice
was on the door.

01:11.820 --> 01:14.732
But this house
is all I got left.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.110
Im working on a plan

01:21.160 --> 01:23.446
to get you back in your home
real soon.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.491
But Im going to need
some time.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.110
What about your daughter?

01:27.170 --> 01:30.492
Billies still coming
to get you, right?

01:31.420 --> 01:32.910
Okay.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.621
Then you go on
to brunch with Vi

01:34.670 --> 01:38.254
and just leave the rest
of the packing to me.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.427
I appreciate
what youre trying to do.

01:40.470 --> 01:42.131
Please, let me help.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.237
Dreams never die

01:54.280 --> 01:56.646
Take flight
As the world turns

01:56.700 --> 01:58.236
Dreams never die

01:58.280 --> 02:00.020
Take flight
As the world turns

02:00.070 --> 02:01.776
Keep the colors
In the lines

02:01.830 --> 02:03.036
Take flight

02:04.540 --> 02:06.030
Dreams never die

02:12.170 --> 02:16.413
Keep the colors
In the lines

02:16.470 --> 02:21.339
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

02:21.390 --> 02:22.800
We dont have time
to be fancy.

02:22.850 --> 02:24.511
Just stack them
in the box.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.516
Uh-uh, there will be no
cracked plates on my watch.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.221
Hand me the clothes.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.102
When Micah and I had to let go
of our old life,

02:38.150 --> 02:40.562
it felt impossible.

02:40.610 --> 02:46.367
Can you imagine having your
whole life uprooted in your 705?

02:46.410 --> 02:48.571
I made some calls
about all that EPA stuff.

02:48.620 --> 02:50.576
Still waiting to hear back
on a few,

02:50.620 --> 02:55.045
but so far, the environmental
issues seem legit.

02:55.090 --> 02:56.455
So Jacob was telling
the truth.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.295
Afraid so.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.329
-[door opens]
-Well, if thats a dead end,

03:01.390 --> 03:02.926
well find another way
to stop it.

03:02.970 --> 03:04.710
[door closes]

03:04.760 --> 03:06.387
Hear more yapping
than packing.

03:06.430 --> 03:07.340
[grunts]

03:09.770 --> 03:11.977
[cell phone vibrates]

03:13.360 --> 03:15.351
Got to meet up
with Darla later.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.311
Got to iron out
Blues schedule.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.100
Since hes with Wood
taking Miss Mae home,

03:19.150 --> 03:22.734
seemed like a good time
to get it done.

03:22.780 --> 03:25.271
My advice?
Stick to the terms.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.619
Focus on Blue and keep
your emotions out of it.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.325
Yes, maam.

03:32.370 --> 03:33.746
[Nova]
Yall see this?

03:33.790 --> 03:35.781
Daddy and Prosper.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.489
[Charley]
I have seen that.

03:37.550 --> 03:41.589
For a split second,
I thought it was Rah.

03:41.630 --> 03:42.881
[laughs]

03:42.930 --> 03:44.136
That dont look like me.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.841
You have the same
mannerisms.

03:45.890 --> 03:47.380
Shes right.

03:47.430 --> 03:50.228
You daddy,
through and through.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.509
Score.

04:00.030 --> 04:01.566
[all laugh]

04:01.610 --> 04:03.908
Yo, look at Ants
peanut head.

04:03.950 --> 04:05.156
Dont be talking
about my head.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.360
[all chuckle]

04:22.930 --> 04:23.965
Damn.

04:26.010 --> 04:27.216
[sighs]

04:27.260 --> 04:29.308
You were right.

04:29.350 --> 04:33.229
What theyre doing there
is foul.

04:33.270 --> 04:36.728
All right, we need
a round table.

04:36.770 --> 04:38.897
Sweetbay Plantation.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.817
Now, we all saw
what they was doing over there.

04:40.860 --> 04:42.487
-Disrespecting.
-Exactly.

04:42.530 --> 04:44.407
-So I say we make some noise.
-[Ant] Yeah.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.940
We got to top
the basketball game.

04:45.990 --> 04:47.309
We could stage a sit-in.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.325
We could chain ourselves
to a tree.

04:48.370 --> 04:50.110
Im not trying
to get arrested.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.741
[Malik] We need to grab
peoples attention,

04:51.790 --> 04:54.281
because this right here,
its a slap in the face.

04:54.330 --> 04:56.241
Every day, people be
rolling in there

04:56.290 --> 04:58.246
making a complete joke
of our ancestors

04:58.290 --> 05:00.918
with their stupid costumes
and their fake-ass accents.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.791
Hell, a hundred years later,

05:02.840 --> 05:05.001
their legacies are shackled
and bound to that white man,

05:05.050 --> 05:07.757
and hes parading them around
like show ponies for cash.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.710
For what?

05:11.390 --> 05:12.300
Selfies?

05:16.900 --> 05:21.223
See, these girls
was taking selfies, bro.

05:21.280 --> 05:25.398
So, no, if they cant respect
our history...

05:25.450 --> 05:27.771
they cant have
our history.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.196
[Ant]
Lets show them

05:29.240 --> 05:31.151
what our people went through,

05:31.200 --> 05:33.441
and not this watered-down crap
they been teaching us.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.456
You know, itd be cool
if we could recreate

05:35.500 --> 05:37.036
the blood on the land.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.741
Yeah, maybe get
some red paint.

05:38.790 --> 05:41.042
[Ant] And cover the ground
around the slave quarters.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.660
Yeah, we should find out
the names of the slaves
that lived there.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.916
[Asha] And then plant their
names all over the field.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.166
Yeah, thatd be dope.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.835
-For real.
-Yeah.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.256
[Ant]
Micah?

05:48.300 --> 05:49.176
You in?

05:51.060 --> 05:52.379
Get out of the car!

06:02.270 --> 06:04.272
Now I cant take no more

06:06.110 --> 06:10.149
Living in the middle

06:10.200 --> 06:11.576
Im in.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.827
Living in the middle, no

06:14.950 --> 06:17.453
No

06:22.500 --> 06:24.081
The best hide-and-go-seek spot
was under Daddys sink.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.041
Yall could never
find me.

06:26.090 --> 06:29.002
You were so skinny and fit
yourself in the weirdest places.

06:29.050 --> 06:33.384
Until that one time
my butt fell through the wood.

06:33.430 --> 06:35.216
-[Charley laughs]
-Mama was so mad.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.727
Mine was the side shed.

06:37.770 --> 06:40.807
Had my first kiss
in that shed.

06:40.850 --> 06:43.262
Oh, the summer that Rah
broke his arm, remember?

06:43.320 --> 06:45.220
Yeah, I remember.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.271
Jerald Washington.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.810
With the high top fade.

06:48.860 --> 06:50.771
You always did
go for the pretty ones.

06:50.820 --> 06:54.074
And you always went
for the smart ones.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.441
And all those
basketball players.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.286
[laughs]

06:58.330 --> 06:59.820
That was Jerald Washington.

06:59.870 --> 07:01.918
Mm, that boy was fine.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.798
Back in the day,
when dating was easy.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.001
Speaking of which,

07:08.050 --> 07:10.041
who is this mystery man

07:10.090 --> 07:13.253
that Aunt Vi may or may not
have mentioned?

07:13.300 --> 07:16.212
Nah, its just
me and my laptop.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.919
Okay. I see how it is.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.977
Thats why expanding
beyond the kitchen,

07:26.020 --> 07:28.022
opening up a pie shop
allow the business

07:28.070 --> 07:30.857
to grow at a good,
moderate pace.

07:30.900 --> 07:34.199
Now, using a model similar
to Sylvias Soul Food,

07:34.240 --> 07:37.038
we can still sell
to stores regionally,

07:37.080 --> 07:41.164
and keep a home base
for the community,

07:41.210 --> 07:43.781
bringing together
my two favorite things:

07:43.830 --> 07:45.331
people and pies.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.758
Well, I thank you
for your time.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.336
Howd that sound?

07:51.380 --> 07:52.836
Sound like you know what you
talking about.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.255
-Yes!
-[all chuckle]

07:54.300 --> 07:57.599
And I am not taking no
for an answer.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.176
Oh, shoot.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.471
Wed better
get back to it,

08:00.520 --> 08:02.306
before Clive try
and cut us loose.

08:02.350 --> 08:04.477
Hes already been through
two new managers. Two.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.932
I aint surprised.

08:06.980 --> 08:10.484
Oh, baby, can I get
two pork chop plates with grits,

08:10.530 --> 08:12.441
-eggs scrambled soft?
-We got you.

08:12.490 --> 08:14.481
-Proud of you, girl.
-Thank you, babe.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.020
[laughs]

08:16.070 --> 08:17.901
-Hey, Prosper.
-Hey!

08:17.950 --> 08:19.156
[laughs]

08:19.200 --> 08:20.531
Mwah.

08:20.580 --> 08:21.899
Hope you aint
been waiting long.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.279
No, sir.

08:23.330 --> 08:24.490
You are right on time.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.121
I just put our order in.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.706
Tell them I like
my eggs scrambled--

08:27.750 --> 08:29.047
Scrambled soft.
I surely did.

08:29.090 --> 08:30.159
[both laugh]

08:31.970 --> 08:33.255
[sighs]

08:33.300 --> 08:36.963
You been busy lately.

08:37.010 --> 08:39.092
Im never too busy
for you.

08:43.140 --> 08:46.644
Charley told me about you
needing to move.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.059
I, uh...

08:53.570 --> 08:56.027
can handle
my own affairs.

08:56.070 --> 08:57.731
Aint nobody
disputing that.

08:57.780 --> 09:00.829
I got it all handled.

09:00.870 --> 09:04.533
And you would tell me
if you didnt, right?

09:07.040 --> 09:09.247
Aint nothing wrong
with asking for a little help

09:09.290 --> 09:10.791
if you need it.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.253
Thats what familys for.

09:14.300 --> 09:17.042
Weve been friends
way too long.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.130
You family.

09:25.310 --> 09:27.050
It finally
feels like home

09:27.100 --> 09:30.263
now that everything
is in its place.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.020
I got Blue
a bunch of snacks

09:34.070 --> 09:36.106
my mom would never
let me have.

09:36.150 --> 09:38.698
Now he wont stay out
of the kitchen.

09:38.740 --> 09:41.402
[Ralph Angel]
Yeah, hell eat a hole through
your wallet if you let him.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.781
[Darla]
Truth.

09:49.670 --> 09:50.830
Looking good.

09:52.170 --> 09:53.580
Doing good, Darla.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.916
Things are...

09:55.970 --> 09:58.291
things are really good.

10:00.510 --> 10:01.420
And this...

10:07.520 --> 10:09.226
this is Blues room.

10:12.110 --> 10:14.021
He helped me decorate.

10:18.660 --> 10:23.199
Yeah, we supposed to be doing
something like that too.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.468
Looks good.

11:04.240 --> 11:08.119
Im surprised every sunrise

11:08.160 --> 11:10.708
The earth would
Have me back

11:14.290 --> 11:18.408
Surprised my knees
Hold me up

11:18.470 --> 11:21.212
That its not
All gone black

11:25.060 --> 11:29.429
And Im sure by nightfall

11:29.480 --> 11:31.391
I will burn up
All I have

11:35.650 --> 11:37.606
Clare and me...

11:37.650 --> 11:41.359
sit out here every evening
after dinner.

11:45.490 --> 11:47.401
I take it youre done?

11:52.580 --> 11:56.459
Your boxes will go
to storage.

11:56.500 --> 12:00.618
I put your luggage
by the front door.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.968
I want you to know...

12:03.010 --> 12:05.843
if you need anything,
Im here.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.188
Ill wait with you,
if you dont mind,

12:12.230 --> 12:14.300
until Billie gets here.

12:19.190 --> 12:21.317
I told her not to come.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.731
Why?

12:26.780 --> 12:28.327
Shes got her own life
to worry about.

12:28.370 --> 12:29.826
Family, the kids.

12:29.870 --> 12:32.657
Ill rent a room
for the time being.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.952
No, you cant rent a room,
Prosper.

12:42.670 --> 12:45.719
Just come and stay
with Micah and me.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.887
Look, you...

12:47.930 --> 12:49.841
I dont want to put you out.
Youve already done enough.

12:49.890 --> 12:52.381
Ive got a guest room
with your name on it.

12:52.430 --> 12:53.180
Please.

12:58.320 --> 13:03.269
Im not leaving here
without you, so...

13:03.320 --> 13:06.869
And no one cares
To ask me

13:06.910 --> 13:07.808
How I feel

13:10.120 --> 13:12.281
Seen more good than bad

13:14.620 --> 13:17.999
Youre stubborn,
just like your daddy.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.041
Why, thank you.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.469
[laughs]

13:38.730 --> 13:39.936
[indistinct chatter]

13:39.980 --> 13:41.891
[hip-hop music plays]

13:51.910 --> 13:53.696
No need to turn it down
on my account.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.490
-I dont know
what theyre saying.
-[laughter]

13:55.540 --> 13:56.700
Theyre speaking the truth.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.377
Only rappers I know

13:58.420 --> 14:00.035
are Tupac and Biggie Smalls.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.239
Hashtag "legends"

14:01.290 --> 14:03.292
All right, man,

14:03.340 --> 14:04.546
-All right. Peace, bro.
-All right.

14:04.590 --> 14:06.046
Im gonna hit yall tomorrow.

14:06.090 --> 14:07.466
-All right.
-Yeah, nice seeing you.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.137
[indistinct chatter]

14:09.180 --> 14:10.750
Get home safe.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.007
[door opens]

14:13.060 --> 14:14.800
[Micah]
I know.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.681
Im going to clean it up
right now.

14:16.730 --> 14:20.052
-[Charley] Mm-hmm.
-Glad youre here, Mr. Prosper.

14:20.110 --> 14:23.432
Prosper, this is for you.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.313
Its a beautiful place.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.066
I didnt know two people
needed so much space.

14:28.110 --> 14:29.350
[laughs]

14:29.410 --> 14:30.775
Make yourself at home.

14:30.820 --> 14:32.481
Im going to go
get your room ready.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.862
Uh, Micah...

14:34.910 --> 14:37.151
On it. Throw that upstairs.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.588
You took care of the sheets
in the bedroom?

14:41.630 --> 14:44.542
[Micah]
Yes, everythings good.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.306
[Violet]
Just a few new ideas

14:57.350 --> 14:58.806
before all this
goes through.

14:58.850 --> 15:00.306
Lets see
what you got.

15:00.350 --> 15:03.228
So for as long
as I can remember,

15:03.270 --> 15:05.522
Ive been baking pies
from scratch.

15:05.570 --> 15:08.858
Pouring my love
into a 9-inch pan.

15:10.200 --> 15:14.569
And having
the opportunity

15:14.620 --> 15:16.747
to sell my pies
in your stores

15:16.790 --> 15:18.781
is a dream come true.

15:18.830 --> 15:23.073
But I realized that thats only
part of the dream.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.119
Okay, so, um...

15:30.010 --> 15:32.922
the other part
is community.

15:32.970 --> 15:35.006
Interacting with folks.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.512
I think that
thats why I loved

15:40.560 --> 15:43.393
working at the High Yellow
so much.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.432
You know, having a home base
for our community,

15:46.480 --> 15:47.686
where I can...

15:50.240 --> 15:53.562
[laughs]
Just give me a minute.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.693
Im sorry.
Im not feeling real well.

15:57.740 --> 15:59.992
-Can I get you some water, or...
-No.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.497
Can we come back
to this tomorrow?

16:02.540 --> 16:04.326
Of course.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.336
Of course. Absolutely.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.792
Um...

16:08.840 --> 16:10.717
Are you okay to drive?
I dont want you driving if--

16:10.760 --> 16:13.422
I can make it home.
Not a problem.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.381
[Jarrett]
Okay, okay.

16:22.890 --> 16:24.471
-Im going to
take you home, okay?
-Okay.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.556
Just give me a sec.
Ill get my keys.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.929
Thank you.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.028
[breathing heavily]

16:44.750 --> 16:46.377
[exhales sharply]

16:48.590 --> 16:51.457
All right, so these are
the alarm codes for the house.

16:51.510 --> 16:55.332
Just try not to lose them.
My mom would freak.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.257
Remote. Okay, so this
is for the TV,

16:58.300 --> 16:59.881
the Blu-ray
and the sound system.

16:59.930 --> 17:01.886
You just got to make sure
that its connected

17:01.930 --> 17:03.807
-to the right source--
-I aint gonna fuss with that.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.647
Can you just put it on 356?

17:05.690 --> 17:07.396
-Sure.
-[turns TV on]

17:07.440 --> 17:09.977
356.

17:10.020 --> 17:11.681
[indistinct chatter on TV]

17:11.740 --> 17:13.059
You like the westerns?

17:13.110 --> 17:14.145
Yep.

17:16.530 --> 17:19.738
[gunshots on TV]

17:19.780 --> 17:21.441
Um...

17:21.490 --> 17:23.242
Yeah, my mom says someone
should be by tomorrow

17:23.290 --> 17:26.498
to drop your recliner
and a table.

17:26.540 --> 17:27.950
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.410
Okay.

17:29.460 --> 17:31.792
-Oh...
-[both laugh]

17:31.840 --> 17:32.625
Peace.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.718
So we alternate
field trips,

17:36.760 --> 17:39.547
PTA meetings.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.306
But both there for
parent-teacher conferences.

17:41.350 --> 17:44.262
And keeping each other
in the loop on behavior issues.

17:44.310 --> 17:46.687
[scoffs]
All right.

17:46.730 --> 17:49.858
Whats next?

17:49.900 --> 17:53.643
You still got a key to
the place, so I was thinking...

17:53.690 --> 17:55.817
I can... I can get that
back to you.

17:55.860 --> 17:57.816
I was thinking...

17:57.860 --> 18:00.408
actually, I was thinking
maybe Id get one to your spot.

18:00.450 --> 18:03.112
That way if youre ever
running late,

18:03.160 --> 18:05.208
me and Blue aint got to wait
in the car.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.071
Yeah, um, of course.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.372
I can get one made for you.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.205
All right.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.126
I know that you have a lot
on your plate,

18:18.180 --> 18:22.753
so I was thinking that...

18:22.810 --> 18:24.880
maybe I could keep Blue
more often.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.090
Just got to take it slow.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.269
How slow?

18:36.690 --> 18:39.989
You can take him
on the weekends.

18:40.030 --> 18:41.907
Rest of the time...

18:41.950 --> 18:42.939
I keep him.

18:48.460 --> 18:52.874
adjust to all of it.

18:52.920 --> 18:57.368
I think that we should both
have him 50% of the time.

19:00.130 --> 19:01.757
No, no.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.131
We can alternate weeks.

19:03.180 --> 19:05.262
Its too soon.
Too soon for all that.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.766
Hes happy here.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.095
What if you
lose your job, huh?

19:08.140 --> 19:10.051
Got to move again
or something?

19:10.100 --> 19:12.853
-I am not losing my job.
-What if?

19:17.360 --> 19:18.941
I mean, Ive been
reading up on it,

19:18.990 --> 19:21.777
and Blue needs stability
right now.

19:21.820 --> 19:22.775
I am stable.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.536
Youre the one
thats got new people

19:27.580 --> 19:29.070
running in and out
of that house.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.030
Bringing that up again, huh?

19:30.080 --> 19:31.786
Yes, I am.

19:31.830 --> 19:35.914
I need to approve anyone new
before they meet Blue.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.541
You talking about Trinh?

19:37.590 --> 19:39.296
I dont know what
her name is, but yes.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.376
And Benny, and those men--

19:41.430 --> 19:42.795
I thought we dealt with that
already.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.046
No, we didnt.

19:45.970 --> 19:47.517
That never should
have happened.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.926
A lot of shit
never should have happened.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.800
But this is where we at.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.806
I...

19:53.860 --> 19:56.977
Im tired of having
this same fight with you.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.986
Oh, here you go.
You tired?

19:59.030 --> 20:00.736
[scoffs]

20:00.780 --> 20:04.523
What the hell you know
about being tired, really?

20:04.570 --> 20:07.323
Mommy and Daddy paying
for all your stuff.

20:07.370 --> 20:11.033
New house with your nice
little car out there.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.993
Because Im working two jobs
and being a single parent

20:15.040 --> 20:16.780
while you out there
finding yourself.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.455
Youre not a single parent.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.411
What you think I been doing
all this time, huh?

20:20.470 --> 20:24.292
So what if my parents
helped me get this place?

20:27.220 --> 20:30.974
Did you pay for that house
youre living in?

20:33.060 --> 20:35.722
Or did your daddy
give it to you?

20:40.490 --> 20:42.856
You can let yourself out.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.535
[indistinct chatter]

20:55.580 --> 20:56.990
Hey.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.416
You can put the rest
in the warehouse.

20:58.460 --> 20:59.666
Sure thing.

20:59.710 --> 21:01.291
Aint mean to interrupt.

21:01.340 --> 21:02.659
Just came to get my check.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.041
I had fun
at your aunts party

21:05.090 --> 21:06.421
the other night.

21:06.470 --> 21:08.506
When I am 60,

21:08.550 --> 21:11.018
please make me as youthful
as that woman.

21:11.060 --> 21:13.688
Not to mention I learned some
kIller dance moves from Blue.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.800
So, you know,
watch out.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.390
You okay?

21:22.570 --> 21:24.447
Yeah.

21:24.490 --> 21:26.902
Just got some things,
you know?

21:26.950 --> 21:28.861
Gotta figure it out.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.707
Sure, um...

21:33.750 --> 21:36.036
Let me grab
your check then.

21:38.000 --> 21:38.910
Here you go.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.541
Appreciate it.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.426
See you later.

21:48.930 --> 21:51.091
Bye.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.960
[KJ] All right.
The guards get off at 8:00,

21:53.020 --> 21:54.385
so anytime after that
should be clear.

21:54.430 --> 21:56.011
All right,
so time it out?

21:56.060 --> 21:57.891
Yeah, me and Ant went there
this morning.

21:57.940 --> 21:59.760
-[Malik] All right, cool.
-This fool was speed-walking

21:59.810 --> 22:01.607
with his stopwatch, had us out
there looking crazy.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.436
-Whatever.
-Look, itll take 12 minutes

22:03.480 --> 22:05.448
to get this done
and be back in the truck.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.947
Twelve minutes to stop the world
and make them pay attention.

22:07.990 --> 22:09.810
All right.
So well have two on paint,

22:09.870 --> 22:12.156
one on signs, one lookout,
and one tagger.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.406
Okay, but who--
are you on lookout?

22:13.450 --> 22:16.283
Oh, Im the tagger.

22:16.330 --> 22:17.957
Asha got skills, dude.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.036
-[Asha] Thats right.
-I call paint, though, so...

22:20.080 --> 22:22.241
-Oh, yeah, me and KJ got paint.
-I|| do the signs.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.915
Guess that makes you
a lookout.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.291
Thats cool.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.710
Yeah, thats cool.

22:34.060 --> 22:36.802
Susys famous
chicken soup.

22:36.850 --> 22:39.262
Guaranteed to have you
feeling better in no time.

22:39.310 --> 22:42.017
And I need you better,

22:42.070 --> 22:44.607
because my investors
are getting anxious.

22:44.650 --> 22:47.278
Well, that is awfully
kind of her.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.527
Please give her my best.

22:52.660 --> 22:55.868
And I want to say thank you
for getting me home safely.

22:55.910 --> 22:56.899
Of course.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.837
Mr. Rawlings...

23:02.880 --> 23:05.872
Ive got something
I need to tell you.

23:05.920 --> 23:06.796
Okay.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.389
Last year,
I was diagnosed with lupus.

23:12.430 --> 23:15.388
Its a chronic illness,

23:15.430 --> 23:18.388
but an illness that
Im learning to manage.

23:18.430 --> 23:23.220
And all that means is that there
are good days and bad ones.

23:24.190 --> 23:26.567
Wow, Im...

23:26.610 --> 23:30.523
Im sorry, Vi.
I didnt...

23:30.570 --> 23:33.152
Uh,
I appreciate your candor.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.737
I mean, I know that probably
wasnt easy to share.

23:35.790 --> 23:39.157
Well, I just want
you to know

23:39.210 --> 23:40.950
that Im going to do
everything in my power

23:41.000 --> 23:43.787
for it to not interfere
with our business.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.580
I can promise you that.

23:45.630 --> 23:50.966
And so Id love to show you
my pitch again.

23:51.010 --> 23:53.672
No, please,
theres no rush.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.460
We can talk
about that later.

23:55.510 --> 23:58.092
Well, I thought you said
that the investors were anxious.

23:58.140 --> 23:59.767
Nah.
Theyll be fine.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.357
I would rather you
just focus

24:04.400 --> 24:08.063
on getting better
and enjoying that soup.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.861
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

24:14.910 --> 24:17.447
Finally heard back
from my friend in DC.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.821
Check this out.

24:18.870 --> 24:21.532
Sams son, Colton Landry,

24:21.580 --> 24:23.741
did his undergrad at Cornell,

24:23.790 --> 24:25.246
graduated in 2000.

24:25.290 --> 24:26.336
Yeah, I got
a file on him.

24:26.380 --> 24:28.587
Yeah, but look at this.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.541
His fraternity brother,
Thomas Rhodes.

24:33.590 --> 24:35.797
Guess where
Thomas works.

24:44.940 --> 24:46.896
[scoffs]

24:46.940 --> 24:49.317
The Environmental
Protection Agency.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.681
Hundred bucks says theres
nothing wrong with our soil.

24:51.740 --> 24:55.358
Ive got a call in
to a friend at the EPA.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.401
[Charley]
Hey, Mr. Prosper.

24:57.450 --> 24:58.940
Yeah, dont mind me.

24:58.990 --> 25:00.821
My sister and nephew
taking good care of you?

25:00.870 --> 25:02.701
Got me all set up.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.162
Oh, hows the interviews
going with the book?

25:05.210 --> 25:07.917
Good, real good,
thank you.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.793
All right, now if you need to
some talk more, you let me know.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.876
Im going to do
some reading.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.716
All right.

25:19.100 --> 25:23.093
Nova, we cant just
sit on this.

25:23.140 --> 25:24.220
Families are being
kicked out of their homes

25:24.270 --> 25:25.510
as we speak.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.260
Theres a board meeting
tomorrow.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.026
I want to see what they have
to say about all this.

25:32.070 --> 25:34.026
I can make some more calls
on my end.

25:34.070 --> 25:37.153
Let me help.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.020
Let me hear what your friend
at the EPA has to say.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.198
Otherwise, this is all
really great, Nova.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.820
Thank you.

25:44.870 --> 25:47.873
But I dont want you
implicated.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.377
You have a book to write.

25:50.420 --> 25:51.580
Yeah.
Okay.

26:13.190 --> 26:15.351
You dont know my story

26:19.200 --> 26:21.270
You dont know my name

26:25.000 --> 26:29.778
You aint seen
My starvmg face

26:29.830 --> 26:31.661
You aint seen my pain

26:36.010 --> 26:41.380
The road I walk
Is mine alone

26:41.430 --> 26:42.670
Only one for me

26:47.100 --> 26:52.185
If you dont want
To come along

26:52.230 --> 26:56.815
You should let me be

26:56.860 --> 27:00.523
Let me be

27:00.570 --> 27:03.232
Everything I am

27:03.280 --> 27:06.579
Let me be

27:06.620 --> 27:09.111
Wild and free

27:09.170 --> 27:12.412
Let me be

27:12.460 --> 27:15.452
Myself again

27:15.500 --> 27:16.660
Oh, let me be

27:27.220 --> 27:28.881
-[door opens]
-[Nova] Hello?

27:28.930 --> 27:31.342
In here.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.606
[door closes]

27:35.980 --> 27:38.608
I dont want
to talk about it.

28:02.470 --> 28:03.425
Me neither.

28:19.150 --> 28:20.981
What are you talking about?
This is a good room.

28:21.030 --> 28:22.520
This was my room.

28:24.950 --> 28:27.908
Its going to be good
when I fix it up.

28:34.920 --> 28:38.993
Besides scrubbing the floors,
whats wrong with it?

28:39.050 --> 28:41.086
Blue deserves more
than hand-me-downs.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.131
Im going to pick up
an extra shift at the plant

28:47.180 --> 28:49.421
get him some new furniture.

28:49.470 --> 28:51.677
Want to get him
some art supplies.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.800
Change up the walls
or somethin.

28:53.850 --> 28:55.681
Add some color.

28:55.730 --> 28:58.608
Blue dont need all that.

28:58.650 --> 28:59.389
Hes a kid.

29:01.690 --> 29:03.738
Hes happy with you.

29:03.780 --> 29:05.657
For now.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.735
Yeah.

29:09.330 --> 29:13.039
Whenever he go
live with Darla,

29:13.080 --> 29:15.958
he sees all those new things.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.491
I aint really
got a choice, huh?

29:18.540 --> 29:21.873
Oh, okay, so you plan
on not sleeping?

29:23.550 --> 29:26.883
-[sighs]
-Taking on more seafood shifts

29:26.930 --> 29:30.422
when you already
got the farm to tend to.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.176
Thats what Pop did.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.721
Even after Mama died

29:38.770 --> 29:42.683
and you wasnt there
no more...

29:42.740 --> 29:47.655
he made sure he took care of me,
no matter what.

29:47.700 --> 29:51.238
With the farm
and all he had going on,

29:51.290 --> 29:52.609
he did all that.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.279
And here I am.

29:58.790 --> 30:02.123
I aint even sure
I got my life straight.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.001
So, you gonna run yourself
into the ground

30:10.050 --> 30:12.302
trying to be like Daddy?

30:15.180 --> 30:18.092
Took a lot of strength,
what he did.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.720
Daddy struggled.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.479
A lot.

30:26.610 --> 30:27.395
Who dont?

30:29.070 --> 30:30.776
Still got it done, right?

30:30.820 --> 30:34.938
Yeah, and he almost died
because of it.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.285
What you mean?

30:46.760 --> 30:48.716
When you saw him
at his strongest,

30:48.760 --> 30:50.330
after Mama died...

30:52.720 --> 30:54.381
he was at his lowest.

30:56.770 --> 30:58.840
Everything fell on him.

31:00.270 --> 31:03.728
And he got
real depressed.

31:03.770 --> 31:08.946
The kind he almost
didnt bounce back from.

31:08.990 --> 31:13.154
What you mean,
didnt bounce back from?

31:13.200 --> 31:14.280
Got so low...

31:17.790 --> 31:21.624
he thought itd be easier
if he wasnt around.

31:24.090 --> 31:28.413
So one night, he went out
to the fields with his gun.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.211
But...

31:32.260 --> 31:34.308
No.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.090
Prosper got to him.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.187
Talked him down.

31:40.230 --> 31:42.607
That dont make sense, Nova.

31:43.730 --> 31:44.469
Not Pop.

31:48.820 --> 31:52.449
Daddy was so busy
trying to hide his pain.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.445
Do it all himself.

31:58.370 --> 32:00.326
It damn near broke him.

32:05.710 --> 32:07.587
But he survived it.

32:10.510 --> 32:12.751
Started the farmers
collective.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.963
Doing everything
youre doing now.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.977
Not shouldering
the burden alone.

32:22.310 --> 32:24.801
Because you got me,

32:24.860 --> 32:27.602
Charley, Aunt Vi,
Holleood.

32:30.650 --> 32:33.153
You dont need
to take on more.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.651
Just stay the course, Rah.

32:49.920 --> 32:54.380
We dig ourselves
Into a ditch

32:54.430 --> 32:57.137
How many of us die

32:57.180 --> 32:59.091
And pretend to live?

33:03.190 --> 33:06.933
We stop the light
From leaking in

33:06.980 --> 33:10.313
When we turn away

33:10.360 --> 33:12.430
From our lives within

33:26.460 --> 33:27.245
[gaSPSI

33:32.550 --> 33:35.007
Prosper?

33:35.050 --> 33:36.881
Lets get you to bed.

33:52.690 --> 33:53.429
Come on.

34:19.930 --> 34:21.886
Mind if I join you?

34:21.930 --> 34:23.466
Oh, hey.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.418
Yeah.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.448
Everything okay
from the other day?

34:41.530 --> 34:43.111
Aint all figured out,

34:43.160 --> 34:44.570
but it will be.

34:46.870 --> 34:48.360
They never taught us

34:48.420 --> 34:50.320
How to look inside

34:53.300 --> 34:57.088
My brother said you wanted
to pick up some extra shifts?

34:57.130 --> 34:58.620
Nah, not right now.

35:02.010 --> 35:03.921
Okay.

35:03.970 --> 35:06.882
How many of us die

35:06.930 --> 35:09.512
And pretend to live?

35:09.560 --> 35:13.018
Aunt Vi wants me to take her
up to that sculpture garden.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.389
Her and Blue.

35:16.490 --> 35:19.527
Ever since you told her
about it.

35:19.570 --> 35:21.367
Family field trip.

35:23.410 --> 35:24.536
Thatll be fun.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.076
She really liked you.

35:34.130 --> 35:34.789
Im glad.

35:50.390 --> 35:53.302
We are splintered

35:53.360 --> 35:55.100
And we are rotten

35:58.940 --> 36:03.445
Deep under the floorboards
Weve forgotten

36:03.490 --> 36:06.323
But all the answers

36:06.370 --> 36:11.034
To all our problems

36:11.080 --> 36:13.162
Lie within the one

36:13.210 --> 36:15.371
Who tries to dodge them

36:17.380 --> 36:20.087
Ooh

36:20.130 --> 36:23.008
Ooh, ooh

36:23.050 --> 36:24.711
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

36:30.230 --> 36:33.188
Ooh

36:33.230 --> 36:36.017
Ooh, ooh

36:36.060 --> 36:41.396
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
