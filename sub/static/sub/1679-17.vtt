00:01.335 --> 00:03.259
This is awesome.

00:03.363 --> 00:05.782
I can't believe this
moment's finally here.

00:05.812 --> 00:09.327
One more mile and my
little boy turns 200,000.

00:09.357 --> 00:12.718
Your baby Fiero's grown into
a really old man Fiero.

00:12.748 --> 00:14.255
And just like an old man,

00:14.285 --> 00:16.158
he leaks fluid, smells stale,

00:16.187 --> 00:17.801
makes weird noises
out the back.

00:17.831 --> 00:18.970
Yeah, he does.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.177
Hey, light up those cigars
in the glove compartment.

00:21.495 --> 00:23.980
They're real Cubans.
I got 'em in Chinatown last year

00:24.014 --> 00:25.200
just for this moment.

00:25.501 --> 00:28.173
Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying
you were definitely ripped off,

00:28.209 --> 00:31.569
but these are chopsticks
wrapped in napkins.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.133
- What are you talking about?
- Whoa, pothole.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.621
What? No. Oh. No.

00:35.658 --> 00:37.161
No, no, no.

00:37.197 --> 00:39.770
No, there's only .8 miles to go.
Come on, buddy.

00:39.808 --> 00:40.960
Buddy!

00:46.925 --> 00:48.613
Is it cool if I
still light these?

01:04.366 --> 01:08.321
Kids, sometimes life forces us to
be someone we didn't want to be.

01:08.405 --> 01:12.211
When that happens, we often try to hold
on to a little piece of who we were.

01:12.575 --> 01:13.962
Maybe a tattoo.

01:14.595 --> 01:16.263
Or a piece of jewelry.

01:16.388 --> 01:19.701
A tiny souvenir that reminds us,
"This is who I really am."

01:20.247 --> 01:22.561
Marshall's souvenir
was not so tiny,

01:22.787 --> 01:25.513
but the more he found himself being
pushed toward the corporate world

01:25.548 --> 01:28.041
and away from his dream of
saving the environment,

01:28.075 --> 01:30.580
the tighter he held
on to that Fiero.

01:30.758 --> 01:31.753
Hey.

01:32.187 --> 01:34.921
One good thing: we're off the
hook for the folding party today.

01:34.955 --> 01:38.401
Hey. It's very important
to both Lily and me

01:38.436 --> 01:42.071
that there be a handmade origami
crane in each of our wedding's...

01:42.965 --> 01:45.042
I couldn't even get through it.
Thank God.

01:45.128 --> 01:46.931
Hey, your car's
going to be fine.

01:46.967 --> 01:48.961
This is the best
auto shop around.

01:48.996 --> 01:50.653
Look at this certificate.

01:50.685 --> 01:52.501
One of the mechanics here

01:52.975 --> 01:55.152
finished a 64-ounce steak.

01:56.125 --> 01:57.202
Surprise.

01:57.236 --> 01:58.951
We felt bad that you
guys were missing

01:58.986 --> 02:01.751
the super-fun origami
folding party, so...

02:01.787 --> 02:03.261
we suggested moving it here.

02:03.298 --> 02:04.803
We insisted.

02:04.968 --> 02:06.343
Terrific.

02:06.815 --> 02:08.163
How's the Fiero?

02:08.606 --> 02:10.080
She's still in triage.

02:10.116 --> 02:12.502
She? I thought it
was your little boy.

02:12.536 --> 02:15.833
Oh, it goes back and forth.
It's sort of a tranny car.

02:15.868 --> 02:19.310
How long have you had her...
slash him?

02:19.518 --> 02:22.341
My brothers handed it
down to me when I was 16.

02:22.377 --> 02:23.831
Oh, how nice of them.

02:23.868 --> 02:25.322
Not really.

02:26.016 --> 02:27.281
Congratulations.

02:27.316 --> 02:29.083
The Fiero is yours.

02:31.137 --> 02:33.810
If you pass the final test.

02:33.846 --> 02:35.190
Come on!

02:35.227 --> 02:38.741
I already shaved my legs and
swallowed five dollars in quarters.

02:38.777 --> 02:40.761
Only $4.50 has come out.

02:41.687 --> 02:43.961
Just go to the
Weinerburger drive-thru

02:43.997 --> 02:45.853
and get us 12 cups of coffee.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.221
- That's it?
- Oh, yeah.

02:48.258 --> 02:50.223
But we get to decide
what you wear.

02:51.097 --> 02:54.621
Agreed. Totally agreed.

02:59.115 --> 03:00.570
You're naked.

03:00.606 --> 03:02.322
I'm aware of that.

03:06.155 --> 03:07.753
You have 50 cents?

03:09.225 --> 03:10.451
No...

03:11.696 --> 03:13.761
Look,  can I just have
my coffee, please?

03:14.035 --> 03:16.252
Sorry, we're all out
of trays and lids.

03:16.285 --> 03:19.661
Two tall guys just came through here
a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:37.035 --> 03:39.630
And that is the origin
of Marshall's insane

03:39.666 --> 03:42.392
"no food or drinks in the Fiero,
not even groceries" rule.

03:42.427 --> 03:44.071
It is not insane.

03:44.137 --> 03:48.062
Barney. That's like the third one
in a row that you've screwed up.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.972
Well, I'm trying, but it's...

03:50.007 --> 03:53.441
Look. You fold twice to the middle,
fold back and forth, pull the ends out,

03:53.478 --> 03:57.443
flip over, open the flaps, fold the
edges, crease the front, fold in half,

03:57.476 --> 04:00.470
fold the wings down, push in the bottom
corners, and fold the wings back out.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.732
Or would you like one of my
kindergartners to show you?

04:04.396 --> 04:06.703
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, I think I've got it.

04:08.297 --> 04:09.352
No.

04:09.786 --> 04:12.632
Forget it; the paper's too expensive.
You're out.

04:12.668 --> 04:14.352
Aw, nerts.

04:17.305 --> 04:20.392
The food rule is insane.
We could have died because of it.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.443
- Remember the 100K fiasco?
- Ah, the Fiero-asco.

04:23.478 --> 04:26.953
Dude, I told you that doesn't work.
It's the 100K fiasco.

04:26.985 --> 04:29.491
- What's the 100K fiasco?
- The Fiero-asco?

04:29.955 --> 04:32.312
It was just before winter break
our freshman year of college.

04:32.345 --> 04:34.832
Marshall and I were roommates,
but we weren't really good friends yet.

04:34.866 --> 04:37.363
I thought Ted was a
little bit pretentious.

04:37.397 --> 04:39.881
And Marshall was a total slob.

04:40.836 --> 04:41.823
Hey.

04:42.955 --> 04:45.441
I'm driving my Fiero
back over break.

04:45.475 --> 04:47.563
I know we see enough of
each other as it is,

04:47.595 --> 04:50.251
but if you want a ride,
I could use the gas money.

04:50.286 --> 04:53.271
You live in Ohio, right?
I could swing through and pick you up.

04:53.606 --> 04:56.773
All right, first of all,
my parents live in Ohio.

04:56.807 --> 04:58.901
I live in the moment.

04:59.468 --> 05:02.382
Plus, Karen and I haven't seen
each other since Thanksgiving.

05:02.416 --> 05:06.460
We're both really invested in making
this long-distance thing work, so...

05:06.716 --> 05:08.701
All right, well,
call me if you change your mind.

05:08.738 --> 05:10.793
My odometer's
going to hit 100K.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.863
She'd be so bummed
if I left early.

05:15.578 --> 05:17.493
It was totally mutual.

05:18.097 --> 05:20.693
I mean, Karen brought it up first,
but I...

05:20.726 --> 05:23.261
it was...
it was totally mutual.

05:23.887 --> 05:25.152
I hear you.

05:25.598 --> 05:28.070
So what's up with you and Lily?
Anything serious?

05:28.378 --> 05:29.420
Yeah.

05:29.455 --> 05:31.121
Dude, we're college freshmen.

05:31.157 --> 05:33.830
I'm not going to get tied down by
the first chick I hook up with.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.851
Lily's cool, but this bird
you'll never chain, you know?

05:37.937 --> 05:41.621
The next few hours of our
drive were classic road trip.

05:51.567 --> 05:54.502
So... this song.

05:54.538 --> 05:56.471
Oh, it's the best
song in the world.

05:56.508 --> 05:58.401
It's the only song I like.

05:59.285 --> 06:00.603
Just kidding.

06:00.705 --> 06:03.333
Tape's been stuck in the player for,
like, two years.

06:03.367 --> 06:04.971
Better than nothing, though.

06:05.786 --> 06:07.021
Maybe.

06:16.225 --> 06:21.090
I am so... sick...
of this song.

06:21.385 --> 06:23.011
Don't worry.
It comes around again.

06:23.395 --> 06:24.652
What do you mean?

06:24.687 --> 06:28.983
# Just to be the man
who walks 1,000 miles #

06:29.016 --> 06:34.611
# And falls down
at your door... #

06:36.155 --> 06:37.791
Yeah, we totally
nailed the ending.

06:37.828 --> 06:39.460
That was probably our best one.

06:39.757 --> 06:41.631
Hey, you want to 
play Zitch Dog?

06:41.708 --> 06:43.261
- What?
- Uh, it's a car game.

06:43.297 --> 06:46.682
Every time you see a dog, you got to
be the first one to say, "Zitch dog."

06:46.766 --> 06:48.380
- I'm pretty good, so...
- Zitch dog.

06:48.916 --> 06:51.982
Well, no, I didn't know we had...
we'd started, but...

06:52.015 --> 06:54.143
Okay, that's cool.
You got the first point.

06:55.376 --> 06:57.440
- Zitch dog.
- Zitch dog. Damn it!

06:58.495 --> 07:00.872
Are we still playing?
'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...

07:00.905 --> 07:02.041
12-nothing.

07:03.508 --> 07:04.673
Marshall.

07:08.518 --> 07:10.943
-  Marshall.
- Zitch dog, blue Suburban.

07:10.976 --> 07:12.013
Damn it!

07:12.046 --> 07:13.560
18-nothing.

07:14.708 --> 07:17.080
Then Marshall,
who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog,

07:17.114 --> 07:18.500
got us totally lost.

07:18.531 --> 07:19.983
Where the hell are we?!

07:20.019 --> 07:22.789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

07:22.819 --> 07:24.431
I think you skipped something.

07:24.465 --> 07:27.062
Really? Seems impossible.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.342
Hey, we got some time.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.562
What do you say we get off the highway,
take the road less traveled, you know?

07:35.078 --> 07:36.460
Robert Frost.

07:37.507 --> 07:39.311
Doesn't seem like a smart idea.

07:39.346 --> 07:40.381
Too late.

07:40.415 --> 07:42.101
I'm taking this exit.

07:42.477 --> 07:45.450
Who's not fun
enough now, Karen?

07:47.776 --> 07:49.292
Then we got lost.

07:49.328 --> 07:51.030
Where the hell are we?!

07:51.337 --> 07:53.510
- I'm pulling over.
- No, keep driving.

07:53.546 --> 07:56.300
We're almost out of gas, and we
might not even be on a road anymore.

07:56.337 --> 07:59.643
It's below zero out. If we pull over,
we could be snowed in for days.

07:59.675 --> 08:02.503
Plus, I only have, like, six granola
bars and three bottles of water.

08:02.535 --> 08:04.093
- Nah, I threw them out.
- What?!

08:04.126 --> 08:07.543
No food or drink in the Fiero.

08:08.577 --> 08:12.073
No food or drink in the F...? You
haven't washed your sheets since...

08:12.105 --> 08:14.920
Thus began the longest
night of our lives.

08:18.965 --> 08:22.371
Pretty sure that my
foot is frozen solid.

08:23.026 --> 08:24.142
Marshall...

08:25.258 --> 08:28.600
there's a very real chance that we're
gonna be snowed in here for days.

08:29.388 --> 08:32.520
If I die first,
do whatever you need to survive.

08:32.558 --> 08:33.730
Eat my flesh.

08:33.768 --> 08:36.293
Slice me open like a
tauntaun, whatever.

08:36.927 --> 08:38.462
Thanks, Ted.

08:39.025 --> 08:40.732
You're a good friend.

08:41.556 --> 08:45.232
And if I die first,
you just leave my body alone.

08:45.266 --> 08:46.223
What?

08:46.256 --> 08:48.442
I just said you could cut me
open and crawl inside me.

08:48.478 --> 08:51.012
Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me;
it skeeves me out.

08:51.048 --> 08:54.110
But... but you're dead,
and I'm gonna die if I don't.

08:54.147 --> 08:56.142
Wasn't an easy decision.

08:57.076 --> 09:00.091
This is all because of
your insane no-food rule.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.593
It's perfectly rational.

09:07.008 --> 09:09.383
Hey! My spectacles!

09:14.757 --> 09:15.592
Hey.

09:17.167 --> 09:18.913
I know we're low on gas,

09:19.636 --> 09:22.850
but can we turn on the
heat for just a minute?

09:24.346 --> 09:25.673
Okay.

09:35.866 --> 09:36.962
D ude...

09:37.768 --> 09:39.572
I hate to say this...

09:40.836 --> 09:42.743
but it's so cold...

09:43.365 --> 09:46.703
there's only one way that we're
gonna make it through this night.

09:52.737 --> 09:55.503
- We should've kept driving.
- Come on, Marshall.

09:55.536 --> 09:58.743
No. No. We might die now.

09:59.318 --> 10:01.500
I may never see Lily again.

10:02.327 --> 10:04.633
I never told
anybody this, but...

10:05.256 --> 10:08.361
I've known for a long time that
I'm gonna marry that girl.

10:09.045 --> 10:12.292
If we survive this,
someday I'm gonna marry her.

10:14.546 --> 10:16.883
I'm sorry about
your spectacles.

10:17.658 --> 10:18.840
That's okay.

10:19.748 --> 10:21.412
They were decorative.

10:27.218 --> 10:28.562
Hey, Marshall.

10:28.737 --> 10:29.983
Y eah?

10:30.987 --> 10:33.273
Are you still
thinking about Lily?

10:33.606 --> 10:34.962
Yeah.

10:35.396 --> 10:37.122
Please stop. 

10:40.605 --> 10:44.092
And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna
die out there in the middle of nowhere.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.321
But funny thing...

10:54.378 --> 10:58.640
Hey. You lovers better
just keep on driving.

11:00.547 --> 11:02.533
- Zitch dog!
- Damn it!

11:04.338 --> 11:07.233
You said you were gonna
marry me that long ago?

11:07.266 --> 11:09.083
That is so sweet.

11:09.117 --> 11:11.782
That trip is when Marshall
and I became best friends.

11:11.887 --> 11:14.361
With privileges,
from the sound of it.

11:15.858 --> 11:17.260
E riksen.

11:38.327 --> 11:39.323
Wow.

11:39.668 --> 11:41.750
Looks like he
really needs a hug.

11:43.148 --> 11:44.332
Ted.

11:51.608 --> 11:55.521
He said it would be at least
3,000 bucks to make it run again.

11:55.616 --> 11:58.123
And even then,
there's no guarantee.

11:58.258 --> 11:59.831
Well, it's a pretty old car.

11:59.867 --> 12:02.462
Yeah. You can keep
prolonging its life,

12:02.496 --> 12:05.692
but it's really mostly
machine at this point.

12:07.405 --> 12:09.261
I know that it's
a lot of money,

12:09.416 --> 12:11.753
but it's my Fiero, you know?

12:12.025 --> 12:15.593
I'm about to graduate and take
some sellout corporate law job,

12:15.628 --> 12:18.302
and without that Fiero,
I'm just another guy in a suit.

12:18.336 --> 12:19.922
- How dare you...
- Hey.

12:20.965 --> 12:23.462
I've been through so
much in that car.

12:24.057 --> 12:26.053
The suicidal cat.

12:28.876 --> 12:30.571
Hitchhiking Waldo.

12:34.516 --> 12:36.863
The homeless guy who broke
in through the window

12:36.896 --> 12:39.322
and threw up all
over the backseat.

12:39.357 --> 12:40.472
Lily, don't.

12:40.505 --> 12:42.682
Be strong. Do not go all
"prisoner's dilemma" on me.

12:42.716 --> 12:45.573
The car's on its deathbed, Robin.
I have to clear my conscience.

12:45.606 --> 12:47.040
Guys, what are
you talking about?

12:47.955 --> 12:51.151
Okay. Shortly
after we met Robin,

12:51.186 --> 12:54.290
she and I were jonesing for
Thai food from this one place.

12:54.328 --> 12:57.231
An hour and a half delivery.
We can't wait that long.

12:57.268 --> 13:01.653
I wish we could take the Fiero, but
Marshall has this insane no-food rule.

13:01.688 --> 13:03.320
But Thai food, Lily.

13:03.358 --> 13:05.000
Pad Yum Mao.

13:05.037 --> 13:06.820
Tom Kai Gah.

13:06.858 --> 13:08.503
Thai See Ran.

13:08.535 --> 13:12.343
Oh! You're just saying random syllables,
and it still sounds delicious.

13:12.406 --> 13:14.561
Okay. Here's what we'll do.

13:14.598 --> 13:18.141
We'll drive over, pick it up,
have them double-bag it,

13:18.176 --> 13:21.950
very carefully drive it back
here with the windows open,

13:21.985 --> 13:23.700
and he'll never know.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.211
Wow, these brakes
are really sensitive.

13:26.378 --> 13:28.622
Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me!

13:28.656 --> 13:31.992
This and the difference between "affect"
and "effect" are the only two things

13:32.026 --> 13:33.651
he's really serious about.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.521
- Lily, it's gonna be fine.
- No, it's not.

13:35.556 --> 13:38.103
Marshall's gonna freak.
Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do?

13:38.137 --> 13:39.362
- Oh, God, oh...!
- Shut up!

13:39.395 --> 13:41.541
Now, listen to me.
The clock is ticking.

13:41.576 --> 13:45.143
Okay, first thing, we scoop up all
these little pieces of tofu and cabbage.

13:45.177 --> 13:47.552
Next, what we need to take care
of are the really messy parts--

13:47.585 --> 13:50.260
the pools that have collected.
We got to soak that soup up.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.143
Last is the smell.
We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai.

13:53.175 --> 13:54.382
You mentioned cigars.

13:54.415 --> 13:56.611
There's two in the glove compartment,
but he's been saving them.

13:56.645 --> 13:58.201
Hand me those chopsticks.

14:02.836 --> 14:04.461
Hey, how about some tunes?

14:06.575 --> 14:08.932
Oh, great song.

14:11.397 --> 14:13.612
These cigars aren't
helping at all.

14:13.646 --> 14:16.071
Yeah. This was a terrible idea.

14:17.627 --> 14:21.793
Now it just smells like a
homeless guy threw up in here.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.821
The broken windows?

14:25.868 --> 14:27.422
We had to make it
look realistic.

14:27.457 --> 14:29.413
Why did you break two of them?

14:29.447 --> 14:33.032
It looked like fun when she did it.
So I wanted to try.

14:34.085 --> 14:36.150
Can't believe this whole
time it was you guys.

14:36.185 --> 14:38.801
I've been blaming really
tanned dancing leotard guy.

14:38.835 --> 14:42.312
Marshall, I'm so sorry,
but sharing that secret--

14:42.346 --> 14:45.092
that's when Robin and
I became best friends.

14:45.125 --> 14:47.802
Wow. What a special car.

14:47.836 --> 14:50.033
So, can I crush it into
a little cube yet?

14:50.068 --> 14:52.180
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

14:52.275 --> 14:53.540
Come on, Marshall.

14:53.576 --> 14:55.112
This is your Fiero.

14:55.146 --> 14:57.141
You know the right
thing to do here.

14:57.176 --> 14:59.822
Wow, Barney,
why do you love that car so much?

14:59.858 --> 15:01.301
Love it?

15:01.657 --> 15:03.152
Hold on a second.

15:03.976 --> 15:05.413
Love it?

15:05.478 --> 15:07.451
I hate it!

15:08.006 --> 15:09.741
What? Why?

15:09.885 --> 15:12.620
Why? Why?

15:13.046 --> 15:14.573
Why?!

15:16.227 --> 15:18.191
- Why?!
- Let me tell it.

15:18.228 --> 15:21.051
It was last year during
the transit strike.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.701
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:22.736 --> 15:24.021
Uh, is Marshall around?

15:24.056 --> 15:26.783
I have a massage in Queens in
half an hour. I need a ride.

15:26.816 --> 15:29.320
Uh, no, he's at the library all day.
Just take the keys.

15:30.817 --> 15:33.053
Hey! Why don't you drive me?

15:33.085 --> 15:34.762
It'll be like a
total road trip.

15:34.797 --> 15:36.030
To Queens?

15:36.067 --> 15:39.482
Yeah, we'll get,
we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.

15:39.516 --> 15:42.051
Uh, actually I have a
lot of work to do, so.

15:42.085 --> 15:45.113
Okay. Well, anyway,
I'll cancel.

15:45.147 --> 15:46.821
- See you later.
- Wait!

15:48.945 --> 15:50.452
You know how to drive, right?

15:50.488 --> 15:54.092
What, of course I know how to drive.
I love driving.

15:54.498 --> 15:55.981
Hitting the road.

15:56.347 --> 15:58.251
Cruising the lanes.

15:58.946 --> 16:00.232
And braking.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.190
Honking. Love it.

16:02.818 --> 16:04.741
Except for lady drivers.

16:04.937 --> 16:07.571
Don't get me started
on lady drivers.

16:07.608 --> 16:09.490
- Which pedal's the gas?
- Trick question.

16:09.528 --> 16:10.410
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

16:10.448 --> 16:12.642
- No, it's not.
- Middle, left, right?

16:14.186 --> 16:16.222
I never learned how to drive!

16:16.258 --> 16:18.640
I grew up in the city.
I never had a chance.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.692
Well, guess what?

16:19.728 --> 16:21.991
You're getting your chance.
Because I'm going to teach you.

16:22.027 --> 16:24.701
Barney Stinson, buckle up.

16:27.275 --> 16:28.621
This isn't right.

16:28.656 --> 16:31.593
God never meant for us to travel
at such breakneck speeds.

16:31.727 --> 16:34.241
Relax. You're doing great.

16:34.386 --> 16:37.200
Ignore the old lady on the rascal;
this isn't a race.

16:38.907 --> 16:40.530
Dude, a dog.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.682
Zitch dog, yes! 1-nothing.

16:43.267 --> 16:45.062
What do I do?
Tell me what to do, Ted.

16:45.095 --> 16:47.961
Step on the brakes.
Sometime in the next 20 minutes.

16:47.996 --> 16:49.641
Which? Which one's
the break again?

16:49.677 --> 16:51.723
- The left one.
- Left. Oh, man, left.

16:51.755 --> 16:53.601
- I'm totally blanking.
- Make the Ls.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.412
Oh, we're not going to make it.

16:56.948 --> 16:58.791
Why did you just
turn on the radio?

16:58.828 --> 17:00.263
I don't know why I
turned on the radio!

17:00.296 --> 17:02.140
We're going to die.
Tell me what to do, Ted.

17:02.176 --> 17:03.540
Relax. You're being crazy.

17:03.577 --> 17:05.811
- Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.
- Stop, drop and roll.

17:09.005 --> 17:12.560
Screaming is fun!
Screaming is fun!

17:22.244 --> 17:23.423
I can't move.

17:23.535 --> 17:26.321
I can't... I can't feel my...

17:26.866 --> 17:28.022
Wait.

17:29.198 --> 17:30.413
Wait.

17:34.447 --> 17:35.883
We're okay.

17:36.228 --> 17:37.751
- We're okay.
- We're okay.

17:37.786 --> 17:40.033
It's a miracle, Ted!

17:41.216 --> 17:45.023
Wow. Sounds like you had
some accident in that car.

17:45.057 --> 17:47.503
Actually, he had two accidents
if you add the fact that he...

17:47.535 --> 17:49.710
hummina-hummina-hummina-hummina.

17:51.658 --> 17:54.451
I shouldn't even be here,
thanks to that deathtrap.

17:54.486 --> 17:55.900
But fate...

17:55.938 --> 17:58.443
fate gave me a second chance.

17:58.475 --> 18:02.670
And helped me realize that our days on
this planet are too few to squander.

18:02.997 --> 18:05.763
So I decided from
that moment on

18:05.798 --> 18:09.781
to continue living
life to its fullest.

18:09.818 --> 18:14.370
So you made a life-changing decision
to not change your life at all.

18:14.406 --> 18:15.761
True story.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.100
Guys.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.542
This Fiero's meant
a lot to all of us.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.320
Friendships were made.

18:22.357 --> 18:25.032
Adventures had. Horrors faced.

18:27.077 --> 18:28.563
That's why we have
to get rid of it.

18:28.596 --> 18:29.840
- Yes!
- What?

18:29.876 --> 18:33.252
It's lived a great life and it
deserves to die with dignity.

18:33.285 --> 18:34.883
But 200,000...

18:34.916 --> 18:37.421
But that's life. You know?

18:37.455 --> 18:39.873
You never end up where you
thought you wanted to be.

18:39.907 --> 18:41.473
I'm not helping
the environment.

18:41.505 --> 18:43.033
Ted's not a philosopher.

18:43.068 --> 18:44.692
Lily's not not a
world-famous artist.

18:44.726 --> 18:47.563
Barney's never driven more
than ten miles an hour.

18:47.595 --> 18:51.200
Robin, I'm sure, has also experienced
disappointment in her life.

18:51.237 --> 18:52.173
Maybe?

18:52.206 --> 18:56.273
And my Fiero's not a Fiero
that went 200,000 miles.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.553
It's okay. You know?

18:59.837 --> 19:01.481
Those are old dreams.

19:02.628 --> 19:06.443
We'll get a new car and we'll fill
that one up with new memories.

19:06.616 --> 19:09.373
And that'll be the car we had
when we were first married.

19:09.426 --> 19:11.702
When we owned our first house.

19:11.998 --> 19:14.650
Maybe even the first car
our four kids remember.

19:14.685 --> 19:16.740
That's so sweet.

19:16.778 --> 19:19.542
The first car our
two kids remember.

19:21.006 --> 19:23.573
I would like to say good-bye.

19:42.008 --> 19:43.273
You know what?

19:43.305 --> 19:45.411
This Fiero,
it's effected all our lives.

19:45.448 --> 19:46.671
- Affected.
- That's what I said.

19:46.706 --> 19:48.083
Just making sure.

19:48.118 --> 19:50.090
Got us all a lot of places.

19:50.128 --> 19:52.383
I mean maybe it's time
we return the favor.

19:52.415 --> 19:54.810
This Fiero should have
made it to 200,000.

19:54.846 --> 19:56.742
So, let's get it out that door.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.951
And we'll push it
the last .7 miles.

19:58.985 --> 20:00.752
It'd do the same for us. 

20:18.276 --> 20:19.740
Hey, geniuses.

20:19.776 --> 20:23.143
The back wheels are on blocks.
That car ain't going anywhere.

20:25.728 --> 20:28.512
- Close enough!
- Close enough!

20:29.425 --> 20:31.803
And so Marshall said
good-bye to his Fiero.

20:31.835 --> 20:33.893
And as the car's
final gift to us all,

20:33.928 --> 20:37.970
the money he got for scrap parts paid
our bar tab for the next two nights.

20:38.005 --> 20:39.743
Arrivederci, Fiero!

20:39.777 --> 20:42.310
You  were the freaking
giving tree of cars.

20:42.346 --> 20:44.211
May you rust in peace.

20:44.246 --> 20:46.803
Rot in hell, devil steed.

20:48.105 --> 20:50.783
And what better friend
is there than that?

20:54.537 --> 20:56.843
Bro. Have you heard
this new song?

20:56.906 --> 20:58.380
I just got the cassingle.

20:58.416 --> 20:59.553
Put it in.

21:03.507 --> 21:05.991
I am never going to
get sick of this song.

21:06.135 --> 21:09.081
Never, ever, never,
never, ever.

21:09.257 --> 21:10.872
Yeah!

21:10.925 --> 21:14.563
