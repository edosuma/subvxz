love her room.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.694
Hey, Olive.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.613
‐Is that Lexi over there?
‐Yep.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.741
Aw, she's even more
adorable than I imagined.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.534
I just wanna
pinch her cheeks,
squeeze her,

09:36.534 --> 09:38.161
and give her
some hard candy.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.330
Am I turning
into my Grandma?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.919
Lexi turns every place we go
upside‐down with her charm.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.462
We went to Nina's Salon

09:47.462 --> 09:49.547
and she taught
a stylist a new braid.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.841
And got a client to
break up with her boyfriend

09:51.841 --> 09:52.926
right there on the phone.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.053
‐Oh no, she didn't!
‐Oh yes, she did.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.349
Oh hey, Lexi, I've got
someone who wants to meet you.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.101
Oh my gosh!
The famous Lexi!

10:01.101 --> 10:03.186
And you must be
the famous Olive!

10:04.646 --> 10:06.481
I've heard so much about you.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.191
And all of it's true, girl.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.861
Lexi, I can't wait
to spend time with you,

10:11.861 --> 10:14.239
but right now, I've got
a ton of math homework.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.491
Which is almost
as exciting as
meeting you.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.243
Wait, you love math?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.369
Me too!

10:19.369 --> 10:21.079
It's my favorite subject.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.288
Quick! What's your
favorite fraction?

10:22.288 --> 10:23.498
Together: Three eighths!

10:23.498 --> 10:24.582
She's a keeper.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.751
Excuse me, ladies.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.586
I gotta introduce that customer

10:28.586 --> 10:30.338
to "Lexi's Southern Delight."

10:32.507 --> 10:34.217
She's so awesome.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.427
I'm so jealous.
You have Lexi.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.972
And I have four brothers
who share underwear.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.768
Anyways, I've gotta go finish
my homework before Ned's party.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.562
Oh, right, that's tonight.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.771
I totally forgot.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.565
I really wish you
could come, Syd,

10:48.565 --> 10:50.859
but I get you wanting
to stay with Lexi.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.569
Yeah, I mean, she's
only been here a few days

10:52.569 --> 10:54.696
and I wanna make sure
she feels comfortable.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.491
Now, don't you feel
like a new person?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.743
This smoothie
is life‐changing.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.036
And you're right,

11:02.036 --> 11:04.497
I think it is time
I had that talk
with my boyfriend.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.374
It's now or never.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.170
On the other hand, she looks
pretty comfortable to me.

11:11.546 --> 11:12.797
You know what?

11:12.797 --> 11:14.257
Maybe I will go
to Ned's party.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.133
Yes!

11:15.133 --> 11:16.259
Oh, and just
so you know,

11:16.259 --> 11:18.887
Emmy's wearing a jumpsuit,
Sophia's wearing a mini,

11:18.887 --> 11:21.014
and I'm wearing
something amazing.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.265
‐What?
‐I don't know.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.641
I haven't looked
in your closet yet.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.562
Hey, Max.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.022
Wassup?

11:30.356 --> 11:32.775
Well, you seem a lot
happier than yesterday.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.903
Well, I thought a lot
about what you said

11:34.903 --> 11:36.070
and you were right.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.406
Alisha's parents would never
let her move to Baltimore.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.158
Did I say that?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.492
I do not recall.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.913
Leo, what are you
talking about?

11:44.913 --> 11:47.373
Well let's just say
after our family dinner,

11:47.373 --> 11:48.958
I may have been
a little off.

11:48.958 --> 11:49.959
What?

11:50.585 --> 11:51.669
So what'd you hear?

11:51.920 --> 11:53.755
Well, Alisha was all,

11:53.755 --> 11:55.757
"I have to go
back to Baltimore."

11:55.757 --> 11:57.175
And her sister,
Essence, was like,

11:57.175 --> 11:59.594
"If you love Baltimore so much,
why don't you just marry it?"

11:59.594 --> 12:01.679
And then Uncle Joe was
like, "I don't want you girls

12:01.679 --> 12:03.306
thinking about marriage
until you're forty."

12:03.306 --> 12:05.600
And then Aunt Maya was all,
"That's their choice,
not yours."

12:05.600 --> 12:07.602
And I was like,
"Are we ever gonna eat?"

12:09.103 --> 12:09.938
Leo!

12:09.938 --> 12:10.980
Anyway,

12:10.980 --> 12:13.358
Aunt Maya and Uncle Joe
said they'd consider

12:13.358 --> 12:16.152
letting Alisha do the rest
of the school year in Baltimore.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.488
No! She can't leave.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.198
Leo, you gotta do something.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.325
Max, have you met Alisha?

12:22.325 --> 12:23.785
You think she's
gonna listen to me?

12:23.785 --> 12:26.371
I couldn't even get her to
pass the potatoes last night.

12:27.205 --> 12:30.166
Why would she wanna
leave Portland?
It's the best city.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.628
Wait, that's it.

12:34.337 --> 12:37.423
We've gotta convince
her that Portland is
better than Baltimore.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.510
Yeah, it's got mountains,
it's got lakes,
it's got great food.

You're leaving out
the best part.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.429
It's got me.

Yeah, maybe we should
lead with the food.

Yep, we're gonna
play some games,

watch Rainbow Pony.

walking by the greatest
donut store in the world,

in Portland, and I thought,

why not get a couple?

Yup. Only in Portland.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.776
Didn't you guys hear?

The owner's opening up a shop
there right on the harbor.

things in Portland,

Yeah. Remember the time
we hung out there?

15:14.080 --> 15:17.208
I do, but what would really help
the memories come flooding back

15:17.208 --> 15:18.292
would be watching the video.

She's homesick.

So what do we do?

18:33.571 --> 18:35.197
Well, clearly Lexi
can't go home.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.699
Her parents are
in South America.

18:36.699 --> 18:39.702
Yeah, but I hate the idea of her
being unhappy while she's here.

18:39.702 --> 18:43.164
Too bad there isn't a way
to bring a little of
Savannah here to Portland.

the big news in person.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.851
Let me guess.
Your parents said you can
move back to Baltimore.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.686
Yeah, they did.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.063
That's great.

Seriously?!

19:15.571 --> 19:17.239
Yeah, seriously.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.075
I know you were trying
to sell me on Portland,

not Portland I would miss.

else I'd miss?

19:45.893 --> 19:47.144
Kicking your butt
at everything.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.188
(scoffs)
You don't kick
my butt at everything.

Well, when I was
at summer camp
and I was homesick,

I would always
go on the swings.
