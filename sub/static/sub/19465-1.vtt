00:50.560 --> 00:51.800
James Dean was the man.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.925
Everything he did was cool.

00:55.926 --> 00:57.363
The way he walked was cool.

00:57.364 --> 00:58.930
The way he talked was cool.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.367
The way he smoked
cigarettes was the coolest.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.445
Can you imagine
James Dean smoking

01:11.446 --> 01:13.165
one of these fucking things?

01:13.166 --> 01:14.725
Absolutely no cool factor,

01:14.726 --> 01:16.210
you know what I'm saying?

01:20.640 --> 01:22.927
You must be...
Roy Boyle, right?

01:23.720 --> 01:25.051
Well, this is a good day.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.243
I was hoping
I'd get a chance to meet you.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.086
Say you used to be something
back in the day.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.725
I mean, personally...
no offense,

01:36.280 --> 01:38.487
<i>but I just don't see it man.
- Alright,</i> man.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.441

07:14.280 --> 07:16.282
a couple nights ago,
I saw a shooting star

07:16.760 --> 07:18.279

that I could
take all of your pain

07:42.840 --> 07:44.285
They're so shiny.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.571
Hey, guess what today is.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.599
Uh, uh...
Is it your birthday?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.170
No, it's not my birthday.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
It's Friday,

08:25.920 --> 08:28.124

15:45.040 --> 15:48.283
You're never a former or an ex.

Very honorable.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.648
Thank you.
Though I got to tell you,

16:01.649 --> 16:04.086
that Vietnam, phew,
that was hard.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.650
Get inside, woman.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.526
LuAnn is having problems with
that damn register again.

16:11.527 --> 16:13.921

feeding these damn bums.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.839
I'm not a bum.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.286
Uh, Grant Hodges.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.490
You sure look like a damn bum,

16:26.480 --> 16:28.960
and you got on dog tags

16:29.840 --> 16:31.285
You weren't no damn marine.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.600
You were.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.680
Look at you now.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.482
You're a damn disgrace.
Clean up, boy.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.320
<i>Pitiful.</i>

16:47.160 --> 16:49.559
Pitiful. Oh, come on now.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.639
That ain't necessary.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.244
We're not doing anything wrong.

16:53.245 --> 16:54.879
Oh, is that right?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.530
Let me ask you a question:

16:58.400 --> 17:01.847
Those signs that you
and every other vagrant carry,

17:02.800 --> 17:04.086
is there some sort of...

17:04.359 --> 17:05.959
homeless union code

17:05.960 --> 17:08.201
or something on how big
the sign should be?

17:08.202 --> 17:09.719
And tell me this:

17:09.720 --> 17:11.799
Where do you all get
those magic markers from

17:11.800 --> 17:13.643
to write on the sign,
and who writes them damn signs?

17:13.644 --> 17:16.848
Stop being a dick, alright?
Just stop being a dick.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.681
You've got some mouthful,
you street rat.

17:19.682 --> 17:20.965
Oh, you said your piece.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.929
He did nothing wrong
to you, okay?

17:25.040 --> 17:26.690
You don't have to rub it in.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.931
If you've got beef, do it
with your wife, alright?

17:29.932 --> 17:31.729
My beef is with your ass.

17:34.680 --> 17:38.890
You get your shit together,
clean up like I said.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.839
Hey Roy, um...
I hope you're not angry with me

17:56.840 --> 17:59.081
that I told Suzie
that I was you.

17:59.082 --> 18:00.923
It's just that, urn...

18:02.240 --> 18:03.839
I don't know. This is...

18:03.840 --> 18:05.804

thing I have in my life

that means something to me.

18:07.324 --> 18:09.448
No, that's fine.
I'm not angry at all, Grant.

18:09.920 --> 18:10.959
In fact,

18:10.960 --> 18:12.479
I'm sure if you're a marine,

18:12.480 --> 18:13.811
you'd make a pretty
amazing soldier.

18:13.812 --> 18:16.679
Really? Wow.
Um, thanks, Roy.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.604
Um, wow.
Thank you.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.839
Want these back?

18:21.840 --> 18:23.171
Nah, you keep 'em.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.485
It means more to you
than it does to me, okay?

18:46.840 --> 18:47.887
Sit down.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.365
What the hell
is all this talking

18:52.366 --> 18:54.042
I'm hearing about you knocking

18:54.043 --> 18:56.520
people's American flags
down off their lawn?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.682
You can't go around doing that

18:59.683 --> 19:02.044
just because you're pissed off
with the President.

19:02.045 --> 19:04.930
You're a soldier yourself,
you all know better than that.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.005
I hear you doing
that one more time,

19:09.006 --> 19:11.479
I'm going to lock you up
for a week, you understand?

19:11.480 --> 19:12.481
Yes, sir.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.681
Alright.
Go on, get the hell out of here

19:15.682 --> 19:17.841
and go get them damn
blueberry pancakes,

19:17.842 --> 19:19.649
or whatever the
hell it is you eat.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.442
You better watch
that cholesterol, boy.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.999
Hello Sunshine, how are you?

19:40.000 --> 19:43.322
What would you like today?
Suzie's dumplings, maybe?

19:45.320 --> 19:47.288
Ping-bang-bang-bang
Bing-bang-bing-bang.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.723
Ping-pang-ping-pang-ping.

19:49.724 --> 19:51.764
Nobody's gonna give
a damn about that.

19:51.765 --> 19:53.522
I'm gonna get me
some Rosetta Stone

19:53.523 --> 19:55.887
and learn every damn
thing you talking.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.965
Against the dying of the light,

20:00.966 --> 20:03.281
there can be no
mercy for any force

20:03.282 --> 20:06.284
blocking his path from
his righteousness.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.085
Wife is having a bath.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.800
Is that right'?

20:19.120 --> 20:20.120
Yup.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.565
Got everything you
need all packed up

20:46.566 --> 20:48.244
and ready to go
right here, baby.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.600
What's that?

20:54.760 --> 20:56.922
This is the master plan;

21:00.960 --> 21:02.849
Port's city there...

21:06.720 --> 21:07.881
the battleship...

21:15.360 --> 21:16.360
checkpoint.

21:23.760 --> 21:24.886
Nice.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.760
Let's do this.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.765
Listen,
I'm not judging or anything,

21:57.766 --> 22:00.730
but the first time should
be special, memorable.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.319
It was, Damiano.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.359
15 dollars, 15 minutes.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.091
Melody.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.685
You boppin'
strippers now, Fully?

22:10.686 --> 22:13.839
Ooh, who was that?
Gonna miss these days?

22:13.840 --> 22:15.524
Yeah, I'll miss it bro.
Hoorah.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.399
<i>- Hey.-
- Hey.-</i>

22:22.400 --> 22:24.162
ls there where the party's at?

22:24.163 --> 22:25.525
<i>Yes, ma'am.
Come on in.</i>

22:27.680 --> 22:30.286
God damn, woo.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.606
Where's the music at?
Turn that music up, boys.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.800
It's time to party.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.999
I see somebody's been
partying over here

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
like a sleeping beauty.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.079
Oh, shit! That's my song!

22:44.080 --> 22:45.206
Turn it up, boys!

22:45.207 --> 22:47.239
<i>Woo!</i>

22:47.240 --> 22:49.208
Woo,
that's what I'm talking about!

22:50.080 --> 22:51.525
Who's up, who's up?

22:51.880 --> 22:54.486
I need a boy who's awake who
can hammer this, alright?

22:54.487 --> 22:55.599
Yeah, Dam! Woo.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.600
<i>I'm up!</i>

22:58.920 --> 23:00.799
Yeah, girl. Hoorah.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.446
Bend it over for me.
Bend it over for me.

23:03.447 --> 23:05.404
Yeah, you gonna miss
this whore, Dom?

23:05.405 --> 23:07.319
You're gonna miss this, boy.
Let me tell you.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.320
<i>Yeah, girl, woo!</i>

23:11.240 --> 23:13.322
What the fuck is wrong
with you, bitch?

23:21.240 --> 23:24.244
You've got no shit boy, no shit!

23:35.280 --> 23:36.919
The other day, some

23:36.920 --> 23:39.646
group came by and tried
to sell me on an idea:

23:39.647 --> 23:41.961
building a paintball
park on my land

23:41.962 --> 23:43.483
so they could play war games.

23:43.484 --> 23:45.164
I mean, who the hell needs that?

23:45.880 --> 23:47.484
Oh, it doesn't sound that bad.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.649
You have a nice piece of land.

23:51.440 --> 23:55.839
So you told me Lincoln was
on your land one time?

23:55.840 --> 23:58.363
Well, I mean,
that's how all this scuttlebutt

23:58.364 --> 24:00.165
started about these
tunnels, you know?

24:00.166 --> 24:02.447
So, I guess they connected
that with Lincoln.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.004
Oh, that's right,
those famous tunnels

24:05.005 --> 24:06.485
start right here at your house

24:06.486 --> 24:08.482
and end up at the
White House shitter.

24:08.483 --> 24:11.839
Yeah, but I'll tell you
what, man. It's true.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.123
One of these goddamn things

24:13.124 --> 24:14.685
is right here in my basement.

24:14.686 --> 24:16.279
I mean, Larry didn't believe me.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.816
He came by the other day.
I showed it to him.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.207
Guy asks a lot of stupid
ass questions, man.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.519
Like uh,

24:21.520 --> 24:23.319
"You think they
can get a golf cart

24:23.320 --> 24:24.162
in one of those tunnels?"
I mean, how dumb is that?

24:24.163 --> 24:25.679
I don't know.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.841
I think Larry
smokes a little too much

24:26.842 --> 24:27.842
of that wacky tobacco.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.479
They built the tunnels

24:31.480 --> 24:33.050
to help Lincoln escape
during the Civil War.

24:33.052 --> 24:35.040
I don't think they had golf
carts back in those days.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.530
See, that didn't make
any sense at all,

24:36.531 --> 24:38.245
what you're saying right there.

24:38.246 --> 24:41.289
Why would Lincoln escape
from the White House,

24:42.840 --> 24:45.885
come through a tunnel and end
up in the heart of Dixie?

24:45.886 --> 24:47.844
It doesn't make any
goddamn sense.

24:47.845 --> 24:50.002
I mean, if there are
tunnels downstairs,

24:50.520 --> 24:51.521
and say there are,

24:52.200 --> 24:53.719
there would have to be something

24:53.720 --> 24:55.210
a little bit more
diabolical about it,

24:55.211 --> 24:57.168
otherwise
that's just urban legend.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.363
Yeah, that's a possibility.

24:59.364 --> 25:01.089
But I know what I got, dawg.

25:01.090 --> 25:03.287
Did you just call me dawg?

25:04.840 --> 25:05.840
That's urban.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.402
No look man, I mean,
let me tell you something.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.281
The land may be silent...

25:15.920 --> 25:17.763
but it has a lot to say.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.249
All the memories
of all those wars,

25:20.250 --> 25:23.323
all the blood spilled
on this land? Man.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.605
Well,
you're referring to the wars

25:27.606 --> 25:29.045
between the Indian tribes

25:29.046 --> 25:31.199
or the war between the States?

25:31.200 --> 25:33.362
No, no, no.
I'm talking about the big battle

25:34.000 --> 25:35.719
of Fort Fisher, man,

25:35.720 --> 25:37.456
where the Union soldiers
kick the Confederate's ass,

25:37.480 --> 25:39.959
and they had this stupid-ass,
crazy-ass general

25:39.960 --> 25:41.759
named General... um, Bragg.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.239
He tried to burn down the
whole goddamn city, man.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.208
He burned down all
the supply depots.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.920
But after that,

25:48.040 --> 25:49.366
all hell broke loose, man.

25:49.367 --> 25:51.966
There were more wars
than you can think of.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.801
Blood was spilled all
over this goddamn land.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.363
It's said that all the ponds

25:57.364 --> 25:58.885
were running red with blood.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.760
That's true.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.841
I didn't know that.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.405
Alright, buddy.
I gotta go.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.362
Come on, man, where you going?
Where you going?

26:10.363 --> 26:11.486
I ain't finished yet.
I got more to tell you.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.125
Of course you're not finished.

26:13.126 --> 26:15.327
You tell me the same
damn story every night.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.644
Yeah, but I'll tell
you what, man,

26:20.640 --> 26:21.880
it's really sad.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.839
Brothers killing brothers,

26:25.840 --> 26:27.639
friends killing friends,

26:27.640 --> 26:28.846
that's what's sad.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.846
You're right.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.607
It is sad,
brothers killing brothers.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.081
But you know what?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.479
You gotta admire them

26:38.480 --> 26:41.479
for sticking to their guns
no matter what the cause.

26:41.480 --> 26:42.481
You're right.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.319
See you around, old buddy.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.320
I'm here, dawg.

26:52.640 --> 26:53.640
Okay.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.159
Excuse me, Gunny?

27:18.160 --> 27:19.650
I got something you
need to listen to.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.959
Must be a fluke.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.644
They said something about
everything's in order,

27:36.645 --> 27:38.404
but I don't detect
a threat here.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.168
What exactly did you
intercept, Corporal?

27:41.520 --> 27:42.965
Uh, transmission stated,

27:43.200 --> 27:44.719
battleship is secure,

27:44.720 --> 27:46.404
Operation Magenta is a go.

27:46.840 --> 27:50.526
Tunnels need securing
and checkpoint <i>72</i> hours.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.165
Then static, Gunny.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.403
Have you picked up
any other radio chatter

27:54.404 --> 27:55.839
about battleships?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.126
Negative.
Just this message.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.921
Port City,
that's a small tourist town.

28:00.922 --> 28:03.284
They have the U.S.S.
North Carolina there.

28:03.285 --> 28:05.244
It's been there since 1962,
but...

28:05.245 --> 28:07.641
that old girl's nothing
more than a museum now.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.241
It sounds like we've
stumbled upon some kids

28:10.242 --> 28:12.607
playing war games on
their walkie-talkies.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.083
Disregard, Corporal.
I give it these are no threat.

28:16.084 --> 28:17.127
- Roger that.
- Carry on.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.165
When does Leo report?

28:55.640 --> 28:56.640
Soon.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.160
Get rid of him.

29:26.800 --> 29:27.847
I am pregnant.

29:28.680 --> 29:29.919
What?

29:29.920 --> 29:31.679
Really? Really? Oh!

29:43.440 --> 29:44.959
Do you mind?

29:44.960 --> 29:46.166
May I have your
attention, please?

29:46.167 --> 29:47.446
What's up?
Knock 'em.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.159
You're hurting me, man.

29:50.128 --> 29:51.164
What are you doing?

29:51.165 --> 29:52.321
Hey, just chill out.

29:52.322 --> 29:53.651
I'm having a little girl.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.519
Oh!

29:58.520 --> 30:01.039
Way to go there.
Okay...

30:01.040 --> 30:03.361
You know, you'd like
to put a helmet on it.

30:03.362 --> 30:06.399
Okay, as you've heard
from the man himself,

30:06.400 --> 30:09.239
we should congratulate
the Boyle family

30:09.240 --> 30:11.322
for your newest
announced addition.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.159
Okay?

30:13.160 --> 30:14.844
May you be blessed and loved

30:14.845 --> 30:17.079
and... and secure

30:17.080 --> 30:19.401
knowing that she has two older
brothers to protect her,

30:19.402 --> 30:22.479
not to mention two
very capable parents.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.719
Okay?

30:23.720 --> 30:26.039
Roy's been my best
friend for years.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.087
And tonight, we're celebrating

30:27.088 --> 30:29.003
his going-away party again.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.642
Okay? He's headed out there
to do what he does best,

30:33.643 --> 30:36.041
which is protect this
great land of ours.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.006
As you owe me,

30:41.360 --> 30:43.044
make us proud my friend
because it's seven months,

30:43.045 --> 30:45.122
when you return to Port City,

30:45.760 --> 30:49.439
father, husband,
friend and hero,

30:49.440 --> 30:51.249
we'll be here waiting for you.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.719
I'm tearing up already.

30:53.720 --> 30:54.720
Okay?

30:55.080 --> 30:57.242
To Roy Boyle, salute!

30:58.520 --> 31:01.285
Hey Roy, you wanted to
take a walk with me?

31:01.286 --> 31:02.679
Um, it might be fun.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.044
Maybe we could hear
more about the, uh,

31:05.045 --> 31:08.089
the troops coming from the
tunnel in the battleship.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.362
No, hey, I'm just
gonna crash, man.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.885
Which troops you talking about?

31:15.886 --> 31:17.685
Well, sometimes, when I'm, uh,

31:17.686 --> 31:20.001
down at the dumpster,
I hear these people talking,

31:20.002 --> 31:22.199
and uh... I don't know.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.883
It's probably someone with
their TV turned up too loud.

31:24.884 --> 31:25.961
What are they saying?

31:27.960 --> 31:30.201
I think it's the show
about the military,

31:30.202 --> 31:33.519
um, uh, it's about
this battleship

31:33.520 --> 31:37.889
that comes up the Potomac
and blows up Washington.

31:38.240 --> 31:41.079
And then they kill
the President,

31:41.080 --> 31:42.959
and uh, take over the country.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.439
Oh, shit.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.166
Underground troops coming
up into the White House.

31:50.167 --> 31:52.322
Oh boy, that sounds
action-packed, huh?

31:52.960 --> 31:54.769
I wonder if it stars
Bruce Willis.

31:54.770 --> 31:56.919
Yeah, it's gotta be TV.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.879
Um, well I'm off.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.645
- Uh, you sure you wanna come?
- Nah. I'm good, thanks.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.124
Hey, buddy.
Come here.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.881
Where's Boyle?

32:12.640 --> 32:14.479
Who?

32:14.480 --> 32:16.164
Roy Boyle, the guy you've
been hanging out with.

32:16.165 --> 32:18.479
Look mister, I don't know.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.801
Okay. I get it. You're
protecting his whereabouts.

32:20.802 --> 32:22.359
I understand that,

32:22.360 --> 32:24.169
but you guys don't need
to be on the street.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.928
Look mister,
I don't want any trouble.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.886
Okay, fair enough.

32:30.887 --> 32:32.999
Tell him to get a hold of TJ.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.565
Farming season is coming up.

32:34.566 --> 32:35.891
I need some extra hands.

32:36.680 --> 32:37.806
I don't pay much.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.162
I could provide you
with three hots,

32:40.163 --> 32:41.163
a cot,

32:41.920 --> 32:43.319
safe bathroom.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.205
Ultimately,
it's a safe place to stay.

32:45.206 --> 32:47.043
You guys need to be
off the streets.

32:50.840 --> 32:51.921
Okay?

32:53.520 --> 32:56.683
Okay, then.
You tell him to talk to TJ.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.928
There's no TV in there.

Asian chick at the diner, is it?

34:58.803 --> 35:01.164
Oh, definitely not her.
That was a long time ago, buddy.

35:01.165 --> 35:03.321
Well, you know she's
married to a brother?

35:03.322 --> 35:05.721
I wouldn't piss him off,

35:06.160 --> 35:07.366

I don't think he's all there.

35:07.367 --> 35:09.124
Yeah, you're right about that.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.966
What can I say? I'm just
feeling a little bluesy.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.844
You don't want me to
bust out crying, do you?

35:15.845 --> 35:17.285
No, no.
Please don't do that.

35:17.286 --> 35:18.439

No, no, no.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.520

35:35.200 --> 35:37.643
Here's to our friends who
aren't here anymore.

35:37.644 --> 35:39.165

for us to share

37:31.440 --> 37:33.090
the true meaning of Easter.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.804
Make sure you bring
her next week.

37:35.805 --> 37:38.167
Very good.
My man, Chester.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.519
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.648
All thanks to you, my head, huh?

37:44.880 --> 37:46.962
You got my message.
Thank you for coming.

37:46.963 --> 37:48.799
Everything alright, Bonnie?

37:48.800 --> 37:51.724
No. I need to talk to you
about something serious.

37:51.725 --> 37:52.846
Alright.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.719
Come on.

37:54.720 --> 37:57.163
I'm a bit concerned.
This is so unlike her.

37:57.164 --> 38:00.084
Becks is always here.
She never misses my services,

38:00.320 --> 38:01.810
especially Easter.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.889
When's the last
time you saw her?

38:04.400 --> 38:06.243
The middle of last week, she...

38:06.600 --> 38:08.568
she won a jackpot
on bingo night.

38:08.569 --> 38:09.721
Jackpot?

38:10.840 --> 38:12.043
Maybe her and Larry

38:12.044 --> 38:13.845
took the loot and went on down

38:13.846 --> 38:15.166
to Myrtle Beach for the night.

38:15.167 --> 38:16.810
I got to run a few errands.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.369
I'll head over there
and I'll check in on 'em.

38:20.370 --> 38:21.839
Thank you.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.490
Don't you worry about a thing,
Reverend Bonnie.

38:23.491 --> 38:25.847
- Thank you very much.
<i>- I'll</i> take care of it.

38:41.880 --> 38:42.880
Oh!

38:45.840 --> 38:46.841
You!

38:47.280 --> 38:48.691
Are you alone today?

38:54.480 --> 38:56.365
No, no, no. Come, come.
Come with me.

38:56.366 --> 38:58.044
Come.
I have something for you.

38:58.045 --> 38:59.849
Come, come.
Come.

39:02.920 --> 39:03.967
<i>Here.</i>

39:04.880 --> 39:06.644
<i>Eat some of Suzie's dumplings.</i>

39:06.960 --> 39:08.041
Here you go.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.640
Eat, eat.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.809
Where's little
soldier boy today?

39:18.440 --> 39:20.681
You scare me.
You give me a heart attack,

39:20.682 --> 39:22.039
just like your food.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.201
What did I say to you?

39:25.120 --> 39:26.167
What?

39:26.440 --> 39:27.440
Get inside.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.967
Yeah, whatever.
Kung-fu to you, too.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.280
<i>You're damn shame.</i>

39:39.880 --> 39:41.769
<i>You are an embarrassment.</i>

39:45.840 --> 39:47.319
You and your good off

39:47.320 --> 39:49.971
rat friend keep
digging in my trash can.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.611
I might mistake
you for a raccoon

39:55.840 --> 39:57.205
and shoot your ass.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.049
You know,
raccoon is some good eating.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.930
Pull yourself together.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.364
And that woman
with the cleaning.

40:39.365 --> 40:40.845
Every time I walked in,

40:40.846 --> 40:42.565
the furniture would
be all moved around.

40:42.566 --> 40:44.679
The sofas would be facing
the opposite direction

40:44.680 --> 40:45.602
of the television.

40:45.603 --> 40:47.639
You know,

40:47.640 --> 40:49.606
this beautiful little girl
has told me a lot about you.

40:49.607 --> 40:50.607
She did?

40:50.880 --> 40:52.403
Is it... is it good or bad?

40:52.404 --> 40:54.162
Because I feel like
I'm nerdy and awkward,

40:54.163 --> 40:56.045
and sometimes I can hear people.

40:56.046 --> 40:57.166
Relax. It's all good.

40:57.167 --> 40:58.399
It's everything

40:58.400 --> 41:00.039
to do with the
amount of homework

41:00.040 --> 41:01.451
- you give this little girl.
- Well, okay,

41:01.452 --> 41:02.963
then that'd actually be true.

41:02.964 --> 41:04.319
Well, it's a good thing.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.481
- Oh, hi. Hi.
- How are you?

41:05.960 --> 41:07.685
What can I get you this morning?

41:07.686 --> 41:09.808
This'll shock you,
but two cheeseburgers.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.006
The first one with fries,

41:12.007 --> 41:13.639
strawberry shake,

41:13.640 --> 41:16.484
second one with onion
rings and a Coke please.

41:16.485 --> 41:17.679
Okay.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.125
Would you like anything to eat?

41:19.520 --> 41:21.521
You know, they have
some wonderful dessert.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.362
They have peach cobbler,
apple pie...

41:23.363 --> 41:25.488
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're all out of peach.

41:25.840 --> 41:28.684
The big deputy, he ate
everything. He ate all of it.

41:28.685 --> 41:30.011
Ugh, dufus.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.449
The chick is certifiably crazy.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.879
Certified, huh?

41:33.880 --> 41:35.159
I'm telling you.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.719
I got the shrink
bills to prove it.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.720
<i>Stacks.</i>

41:38.880 --> 41:40.006
Go ahead, Sheriff.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.366
<i>I'm going to
head on out to Larry</i>

41:42.367 --> 41:43.486
<i>and Beck's place.</i>

41:44.200 --> 41:46.123
Copy that.
I'll meet you out there in 15.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.202
Gotta go to bounce
and Larry coroners.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.043
- You got this?
- I got this.

41:51.044 --> 41:52.719
Alright, cool.
I'll buy the beer.

41:52.720 --> 41:53.720
Tea.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.571
- Okay.
- Enjoy-

41:58.720 --> 42:01.326
Okay, so what branch of the
service was your husband?

42:02.040 --> 42:04.088
You served? Really?

42:04.440 --> 42:05.405
Yes.

42:05.406 --> 42:06.401
Come on.

42:06.402 --> 42:08.679
Army, medic.
Husband?

42:08.680 --> 42:10.405
You haven't been
listening at all.

42:10.406 --> 42:12.364
What, do I look like
a soldier to you?

42:12.365 --> 42:14.328
She's too beautiful
to be a soldier.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.206
My dad was in Iraq, too.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.039
Really?

42:18.040 --> 42:19.879
Easy, Cass.
Easy, easy.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.120
Don't talk like that.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.279
Don't drink that too fast

42:23.280 --> 42:25.601
or you'll get one of those...
ice cream headaches.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.650
Well, tell me about it, soldier.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.880
Not a soldier, doll.

42:31.880 --> 42:32.880
I'm a marine.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.719
That's right.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.999
Marines aren't
soldiers are they?

42:37.000 --> 42:38.081
They're marines.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.399
Proud.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.606
Very proud to be a marine.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.521
Desert Storm,

42:45.120 --> 42:46.849
trained hand-to-hand
combat expert,

42:47.640 --> 42:49.399
part of the team

42:49.400 --> 42:50.686

Patriot missile.

42:50.687 --> 42:52.759
So I mean, there's absolutely

42:52.760 --> 42:55.923
no question I am a
very proud marine.

Somethings wrong.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.531
- Over here, buddy.
- Something's wrong.

46:29.532 --> 46:31.199
What's up?

46:31.200 --> 46:33.009
Go to the television, dude.
It's got the executions.

46:33.010 --> 46:34.206
Hold on.
Slow it down.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.246
Go to the TVNN site.

46:36.880 --> 46:40.119
I think it's going down here.

46:40.120 --> 46:41.643
You're telling me

46:41.644 --> 46:44.530
that the executions are
happening here in Port City?

46:44.531 --> 46:45.965
- Yes.
- Really?

46:46.240 --> 46:48.004
- Dude, it's happening...
- Have you lost your mind?

46:48.005 --> 46:50.162
Dude, we have something
living here in Port City.

46:53.480 --> 46:54.480
<i>ROY -</i>

46:55.480 --> 46:57.839
TJ, TJ!

46:57.840 --> 46:59.559
Go to the TVNN site,

46:59.560 --> 47:01.319
check it out!
Did you see it!?

47:01.320 --> 47:02.321
I did not see it.

47:02.322 --> 47:03.959
I'm telling you...

47:03.960 --> 47:05.403
I don't know what
you're talking about.

47:05.404 --> 47:06.811
- It's going down here...
- I have no idea.

47:06.813 --> 47:07.801
TJ, it's going down here.

47:07.802 --> 47:09.039
The executions,

47:09.040 --> 47:10.644
I think they're happening here.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.159
- Here!
- You've lost it, man.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.889
- You need to believe me.
- You've lost it, dude.

47:14.890 --> 47:17.326
We have something living
here in Port City.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.721
We have something living
here in Port City.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.399
Please calm down

47:23.400 --> 47:25.402
and come back to reality.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.602
Think about what you're saying.

47:27.603 --> 47:29.443
Think about what
you're saying, man.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.804
This is Port City.
The little Port City.

47:31.805 --> 47:34.366
Honest to God,
we're on American soil.

47:34.367 --> 47:36.522
That does not happen
on American soil.

47:36.523 --> 47:37.799
Okay?

47:37.800 --> 47:38.801
No, I know what I saw.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.719
I saw what I saw.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.159
I saw it!

47:42.160 --> 47:43.844
I saw it!
I saw it! TJ.

47:44.400 --> 47:47.131
I saw it! I saw it!
It's happening here, TJ.

47:47.760 --> 47:48.841
TJ!

47:57.680 --> 47:58.727
Here,

47:59.480 --> 48:01.084
have some of Suzie's dumplings.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.082
Where's little
soldier boy today?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.604
Daddy, look!
It's uncle Roy!

48:24.600 --> 48:25.647
I know it was you!

48:25.648 --> 48:26.879
You did this!

48:26.880 --> 48:27.642
It was you!

48:27.643 --> 48:28.721
Ah, crazy!

48:29.520 --> 48:30.520
I know it's you!

48:30.800 --> 48:31.881
You did this!

48:32.800 --> 48:33.999
Let go of me!

48:34.000 --> 48:34.967
You're not listening to me!

48:34.968 --> 48:36.086
It was you!

48:36.800 --> 48:38.802
- You did this!
- What the hell is going on?

48:38.803 --> 48:40.279
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

48:40.280 --> 48:41.959
Stop this shit right now.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.485
- You did it!
- This is why we don't feed...

48:43.486 --> 48:45.199
- the damn bums, baby.
- You did this!

48:45.200 --> 48:46.200
Stop this shit.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.160
Bitch!

48:57.680 --> 48:58.680
Look,

48:59.400 --> 49:01.448
I understand why you're hurting.

49:02.560 --> 49:03.560
You miss him.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
I get it, bro.

49:06.280 --> 49:08.282
But you got to snap
back to reality.

49:08.283 --> 49:11.599
Look, go check...
go to the TVNN site,

49:11.600 --> 49:12.726
check the video.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.929
Why would I make
something like this up?

49:17.680 --> 49:19.409
Is that all you've
got to say to me?

49:20.160 --> 49:21.241
Is it?

49:22.280 --> 49:24.803
My daughter is worried
to death about you,

49:24.804 --> 49:26.131
and so is everybody else.

49:27.160 --> 49:30.243
You've been living on the
street for 18 months now.

49:30.244 --> 49:31.839
18 months and this is...

49:31.840 --> 49:33.080
They were killed, okay?

49:33.360 --> 49:34.360
Our brothers.

49:35.080 --> 49:36.919
Something...

49:36.920 --> 49:39.969
something is not right here
in America's backdoor.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.408
Easy, Roy.
No one here is the enemy.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.723
Go on.
Go check it out.

49:46.520 --> 49:47.520
Go!

49:47.760 --> 49:49.599
<i>ROY -</i>

49:49.600 --> 49:50.806
Roy, do you understand
what you're saying?

49:50.807 --> 49:52.163
You're accusing our town

49:52.164 --> 49:53.764
of some kind of
homegrown terrorism?

49:54.280 --> 49:55.406
That's nuts.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.240
People we see every day?

49:57.520 --> 49:58.567
People we love?

49:59.120 --> 50:01.282
That's crazy talk, man,
just crazy talk.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.126
I know what I saw.

50:03.720 --> 50:04.720
I know what I saw.

50:07.040 --> 50:08.166
Grant was onto something.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.959
Grant, the man talks to walls.

50:10.960 --> 50:11.960
Don't judge!

50:12.720 --> 50:13.801
Check it out!

50:14.800 --> 50:16.399
Do some police work

50:16.400 --> 50:17.890
instead of being a
party-fighter for the

50:17.891 --> 50:19.291
sake of our town.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.366
Fine.
I'll check it out.

50:21.367 --> 50:23.362
But if nothing else
can calm you down...

50:33.920 --> 50:35.762
<i>And yet another American soldier</i>

50:35.763 --> 50:37.522
<i>has crossed the
border to join forces</i>

50:37.523 --> 50:39.488
<i>with the extreme radical

50:39.489 --> 50:41.159

50:41.160 --> 50:43.364
<i>Making him the 13th
American soldier</i>

50:43.365 --> 50:44.521
<i>to engage with the group.</i>

50:45.080 --> 50:46.839
<i>The soldier's identity</i>

50:46.840 --> 50:48.319
<i>is currently being
kept confidential</i>

50:48.320 --> 50:49.480
<i>for the safety of his family.</i>

50:50.680 --> 50:51.647
<i>Recently,

50:54.603 --> 50:56.568

<i>This is the first time

51:11.640 --> 51:13.721
Your sandwich is
almost ready, Tom.

51:13.722 --> 51:14.881
Thank you, sweetheart.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.040
You alright?

51:20.120 --> 51:21.770
It's been a rough kind of day.

51:22.440 --> 51:24.639
My one friend turned up dead

51:24.640 --> 51:28.008
and I had to put another one
in jail, a lot on the brain.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.400
Oh, hi!

51:40.320 --> 51:42.163
Deputy Parks told me
you would be here.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.762
Baby girl, I'll have the usual.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.405
What you up to, Thomas?

51:54.406 --> 51:55.970
Not what you think.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.564
Yeah, yeah right.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.045
Oh, you got the controls.
What, do you own the place?

52:04.046 --> 52:05.326
Home away from home, dawg.

52:06.280 --> 52:07.770
Chinatown, what can I get you?

52:11.120 --> 52:12.167
Classic martini.

52:12.960 --> 52:13.959
Gin or vodka?

52:13.960 --> 52:14.960
Vodka.

52:16.840 --> 52:17.887
Vodka.

52:18.680 --> 52:19.959
Olive?

52:19.960 --> 52:20.960
Twist.

52:22.120 --> 52:23.239
Make it a twist.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.239
You got it.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.651
Ah, Sheriff.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.839
You remembered my drink,
impressive.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.490
How can I forget?

52:32.800 --> 52:34.159
Yes, ma'am.

52:34.160 --> 52:35.969
Brother is gonna be pissed, man.

52:40.680 --> 52:41.879
You know,

52:41.880 --> 52:43.003
the two of you men together

52:43.004 --> 52:44.206
are like schoolchildren.

52:44.207 --> 52:45.519
It's very sweet.

52:45.520 --> 52:47.841
Oh, we've known each
other 32 years.

52:48.560 --> 52:49.846
32 years?

52:50.720 --> 52:52.165
Man, you never could count.

52:52.560 --> 52:53.879
It's more like 42.

52:53.880 --> 52:56.008
I've known you since
kindergarten.

52:56.600 --> 52:58.807
I'm the only black
friend you got, man.

53:04.160 --> 53:05.719
Sheriff,

53:05.720 --> 53:07.799
Kenny and I talked and...

53:07.800 --> 53:09.245
we don't want to press charges.

53:09.960 --> 53:12.004
This poor man has
been through so much.

53:12.005 --> 53:13.885
We don't want to
damage him anymore.

53:13.886 --> 53:15.962
Maybe he should see a
doctor or something.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.611
That's very nice to hear.

53:19.720 --> 53:20.926
I got to get going-

53:22.000 --> 53:23.805
Donna,
you got that sandwich ready?

53:23.806 --> 53:24.926
<i>It's right here, Tom.</i>

53:26.120 --> 53:29.679
Let me get a round of
tequilas for everybody.

53:29.680 --> 53:30.719
<i>You got it.</i>

53:30.720 --> 53:31.881
Here you go.

53:32.880 --> 53:33.881
<i>Thank you.</i>

53:42.600 --> 53:45.080
Alright. Drink up, everybody.
Have a good day.

53:45.400 --> 53:46.799
See you, Thomas.

53:46.800 --> 53:47.801
Have a nice one, dawg.

54:35.880 --> 54:36.881
Hey?

54:39.320 --> 54:40.320
Suzie?

55:03.120 --> 55:04.120
Suzie?

55:08.520 --> 55:09.646
Suzie?

55:14.680 --> 55:15.841
Oh, hi.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.930
What are you doing here?

55:21.640 --> 55:22.846
Are you okay?

55:23.880 --> 55:25.882
So thoughtful.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.805
What are you doing?
What the hell?

56:05.960 --> 56:06.927
Let me go

56:06.928 --> 56:08.119
and I'll tell you!

56:08.120 --> 56:09.120
I'll tell you!

56:09.800 --> 56:11.239
Let me go!

56:11.240 --> 56:12.810
You tell me first
and I'll let you go.

56:13.480 --> 56:14.527
Okay.

56:14.840 --> 56:16.080
Okay, okay.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.721
The Sheriff... the Sheriff...

56:19.000 --> 56:20.365
go to Chester's house

56:20.880 --> 56:23.087
is the checkpoint, okay?

56:23.600 --> 56:25.568
See? I tell you.
Now you let me go.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.326
I'm sorry, I can't.

57:21.160 --> 57:22.400
I ain't a part of this.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.359
Someone's right.

57:25.360 --> 57:27.089
The street rat came in

57:28.600 --> 57:30.006
and then the Sheriff popped up

57:30.007 --> 57:31.485
in the alley to talk to her,

57:31.486 --> 57:33.289
and then she
snuck off to the bar.

57:35.720 --> 57:37.085
She fed a lot of people.

57:39.280 --> 57:42.011
She sneaked food out
to the back to women

57:42.560 --> 57:43.800
and then they vanished.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.448
I didn't think nothing
of it at first.

57:47.800 --> 57:49.882
Hell, I didn't even know
that we owned this.

57:52.560 --> 57:55.039
But she didn't know
that I could read lips.

57:55.040 --> 57:57.281
Today, the Sheriff came by
and he told her

57:58.200 --> 57:59.361
to get ready,

58:00.200 --> 58:02.123
and that they'll meet
at the checkpoint.

58:05.120 --> 58:06.167
So, what do we do?

58:10.480 --> 58:11.606
I know someone...

58:12.240 --> 58:13.446
he'll know what to do.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.120
I checked out your story.

58:22.280 --> 58:23.884
- I dug around.
- And?

58:24.560 --> 58:25.886
I got to wait for the Sheriff.

58:25.887 --> 58:27.370
He'll know what to do with this,

58:27.371 --> 58:28.479
who to call.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.039
This is state police,

58:30.040 --> 58:31.399
military maybe.

58:31.400 --> 58:32.606
What'd you find out?

58:34.160 --> 58:35.160
You're right, okay?

58:36.320 --> 58:37.919
I found something.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.331
What? Well, what'd you
find out, Freddy?

58:39.332 --> 58:40.401
You're out of here.

58:40.680 --> 58:41.841
What'd you find out?

58:43.320 --> 58:45.288
I found these behind
the dumpster.

58:45.680 --> 58:47.011
This isn't a coincidence.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.123
What's going on, fellas?

58:55.124 --> 58:56.884
Oh, I'm just talking to Roy.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.201
How's it going, buddy?

59:01.080 --> 59:03.039
Hey, man.
I got you....

59:03.040 --> 59:04.724
one of your favorite sandwiches.

59:05.600 --> 59:08.171
Sorry about having to
slip it through the bar.

59:08.172 --> 59:10.970
Roast beef, no Swiss
cheese, pickle,

59:11.440 --> 59:14.808
a little bit of mayo and a
cookie cola to wash it down.

59:15.760 --> 59:17.922
Probably haven't had
one in a long time.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.481
You don't wanna
eat that all, do you?

59:20.482 --> 59:22.125
Take it easy there, big boy.

59:22.126 --> 59:23.406
He eats in his own time.

59:24.920 --> 59:26.410
You know, Roy...

59:32.480 --> 59:35.290
it's a good thing folks
around here still like you.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.770
I just spoke with Suzie and...

59:38.320 --> 59:40.846
her and Kenny aren't
going to press charges.

59:42.440 --> 59:43.963
Now, I gotta tell you something,

59:43.964 --> 59:45.849
you're really around here.

59:47.160 --> 59:48.679
Nowadays,

59:48.680 --> 59:51.001
you're just scaring the
hell out of everyone.

59:51.002 --> 59:54.288
All this talk about
townsfolk killing soldiers.

59:54.680 --> 59:57.411
It's like yelling "fire"
in a crowded movie theater.

59:57.412 --> 59:58.959
You just don't do that.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.088
You don't put the people
in a panic frenzy.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.520
I know.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.324
What the hell's going on, son?

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.003
Sheriff, I think you...

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:09.889
You just hold on there, Freddy.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.366
I'm trying to talk to Roy.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.839
I wish I could say I
understand you Roy,

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.840
but I don't.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.199
But I want to tell you this.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.770
You need to get your
shit together, son,

01:00:23.771 --> 01:00:25.922
and be able to stand
back up on your feet.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840
You're right.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.164
I think I have just been tired.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.730
I was wrong for my actions.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.845
I need to clean up my act.

01:00:36.846 --> 01:00:39.283
Roy? Roy,
what are you doing?

01:00:39.284 --> 01:00:41.044
What do you mean
about that, Deputy?

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.964
You got something on your mind?

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.965
Sheriff, Roy was correct.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.885
I checked into what he said.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.081
Well, Roy just told me he was

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.365
fabricating a whole story,
now it happened?

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.359
Freddy, it's okay.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.725
I just need rest.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.199
Okay? I've been tired.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.247
I'm tired.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.280
He can handle this.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.840
Well, somebody better
start talking plain here.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.360
I found these.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400
My, my.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.884
Lordy, Lordy. I sure wish you
hadn't done that, Freddy.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.921
What just happened?

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.685
Hey, put the gun down.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.124
You go downstairs
and lock the door.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.925
What just happened?

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.886
What just happened?

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.727
What just happened
is a sacrifice

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.401
in a cause that is long overdue.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.690
What?
What are you talking about?

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.405
This was not my intention,

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.201
but it is a necessary evil

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.119
in the execution of
our great revolution.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.765
Dude, you're not
making any sense.

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:20.003
Oh, I'm making more sense than
anybody has in a long time.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.206
God...

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.485
It's time for America
to rise from the ashes.

01:02:26.486 --> 01:02:27.719
Are you out of your mind?

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.767
Are you even...

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.164
The day has finally come when
justice shall be served,

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.681
and the new and greater America

01:02:35.682 --> 01:02:37.086
will rise from the ashes.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.764
Seriously,
are you out of your mind!?

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.482
No, I've never known
greater clarity.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.490
And you served this country,

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.999
and so did I.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.079
I have held good American boys

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.959
in my arms and watched them die,

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.961
and for what?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.649
To serve the whims and the
financial interest of gutless,

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:56.079
greedy politicians.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.959
Politicians who would
pick the pockets

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.323
of all good Americans,

01:03:00.324 --> 01:03:03.162
while they fill their
own coffers with gold,

01:03:03.163 --> 01:03:04.842
earned by the blood
of better men.

01:03:04.843 --> 01:03:07.286
So are you telling me
you just killed Freddy,

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.519
and Grant, and the others,

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.170
because you're pissed
off at the government?

01:03:11.171 --> 01:03:12.844
You are not listening
to me, Roy.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.519
Deputy Parks had to die

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.285
because he could never
be a part of this cause.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.723
And before this night is over,
many will perish.

01:03:21.724 --> 01:03:23.799
Scores will fall,

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.479
friends and family

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.529
will be sacrificed for a
greater, noble cause.

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:31.959
So, you just killed
innocent soldiers

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.769
to prove a freaking point?

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.610
There are no innocents!

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.169
Military or civilian,

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.519
the day has finally come

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.359
for all good Americans
to take up a rifle

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.199
and fight for this cause
or die in its wake.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.202
Blood will run
through the streets

01:03:50.203 --> 01:03:52.201
and the valleys of this nation

01:03:52.202 --> 01:03:54.282
so that this country
can be free again.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.165
Listen to me Roy,

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.882
I want you to be a
part of us, Roy.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.279
I want you to sit down

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.691
and I want you to
think about what I'm saying

01:04:03.692 --> 01:04:05.045
to you, son.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.087
They have done you wrong.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.330
There's a greater goal
and there's a greater reason.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.841
You're out of your mind.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.291
<i>TVNN is warning the
nature of this video</i>

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:23.519
<i>is intended for mature audiences</i>

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.284
<i>due to the horrific execution</i>

01:04:25.285 --> 01:04:27.399
<i>of 12 American hostages</i>

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.801
<i>being tortured and
finally killed.</i>

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.887
So tell me again what happened.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.531
I would like you to be part
of our fight, brother.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.120
You...

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.161
you were a Special
Forces lieutenant.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.771
You took the oath.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.641
You served this
country with honor

01:04:54.642 --> 01:04:56.130
and distinction,

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.965
and what did they do for you?

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.721
Nothing.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.249
On the day that you were
supposed to be discharged,

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.286
they told you what? You don't
have a home to go back to.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.999
It was all swept
away by a tornado,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.604
and your pregnant wife,

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.405
and your children,

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.279
and even your parents

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.962
who happened to
be there visiting

01:05:21.963 --> 01:05:24.327
on the day of the terrible
tragedy were all killed.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.521
That callous and heartless
decision took a piece

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.443
of your soul away that
you will never get back.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.884
You come and you be a
member of my family, Roy,

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.003
a family that will
take back this nation

01:05:43.004 --> 01:05:44.684
from the filthy ideologues

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.399
that sit on both
sides of the table

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.687
and give it back
to we the people.

01:05:49.688 --> 01:05:51.519
So you and Stacks

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.440
think you're going to go
up against this country?

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.925
Dude, you're insane.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.163
- You're insane.
- We're not alone.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.089
There are thousands
just like us,

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.839
trained and eager to
fight upon my word.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.444
You know, it's a
little late to rewrite

01:06:07.445 --> 01:06:08.799
the constitution.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.484
Thomas Jefferson said

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.364
that when a government can
no longer serve its people,

01:06:14.365 --> 01:06:17.602
then it is the duty of its
citizen to rise and revolt,

01:06:17.603 --> 01:06:18.840
and that we shall so.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.960
As we speak...

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.764
tonight the Great North
Carolina will deploy

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.879
and sail right into Washington

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.848
and lay siege upon the capital.

01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:32.887
This is real.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.566
Dang it

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.885
We need to do something.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.681
Let's go get ROY-

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.885
Oh, so you think you
can just, what,

01:06:42.886 --> 01:06:45.041
steal an old battleship
and go unnoticed,

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:46.563
just sail up there like that?

01:06:46.564 --> 01:06:48.528
You forgot what
country you live in.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.041
Oh, what? Everyone
thinks I'm crazy

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.690
because I chose to
live off the grid?

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.528
Sir, you are bat shit crazy.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.042
It's a new system,

01:06:59.043 --> 01:07:01.202
a new government;
from the people, for the people.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.328
We're going to be
heroes to the people.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.681
No, you ain't no hero, man.
You're a punk.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.681
Goddamn terrorists
breathing free air,

01:07:10.682 --> 01:07:13.206
the freedom that our brothers
of arms defend for you.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.965
You're a bunch of
sadistic traitor asses.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.679
Yeah, it's truly what
you should your army.

01:07:21.646 --> 01:07:22.646
Traitors.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.163
You know, I would have
more respect for you

01:07:26.164 --> 01:07:28.161
if you crossed the
border and joined some

01:07:28.162 --> 01:07:29.603
other radical group and

01:07:29.604 --> 01:07:31.921
jumped on the hate
everyone bandwagon.

01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:33.445
But planning something like this

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.171
on your own land
against your own people,

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.884
taking innocent lives
because you think worthy?

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.320
Punk.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.887
You're a punk.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.330
You have a lot of heart, Roy.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.966
And I would've loved that
you join us in this fight.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.845
But I suppose it's best that
you die with the others

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.762
so that this great
country may be reborn.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.806
They heard the gunshot.
They want to speak to you.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.962
Prepare to meet your maker, son.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.765
Fuck!

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.441
Alright, folks, listen up.
Everything is fine.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.685
One of our deputies discharged

01:08:48.685 --> 01:08:50.122
his weapon. Nobody's hurt.

01:08:50.124 --> 01:08:51.685
<i>But I saw Suzie</i>

01:08:51.685 --> 01:08:54.319
get attacked by someone
dressed <i>in black.</i>

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:55.970
<i>And I heard</i> a
<i>gunshot from the diner</i>

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.319
<i>and We. been
closed since noon.</i>

01:08:58.319 --> 01:08:59.399
<i>Look, I don't know what</i>

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.685
<i>you saw, what you think you saw,</i>

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.841
<i>but everything is
going to be alright.</i>

01:09:03.843 --> 01:09:06.319
I want you all to go home
and <i>stay</i> home.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.603
<i>Come morning, everything's</i>

01:09:08.604 --> 01:09:09.680
<i>going to be fine,</i>

01:09:09.682 --> 01:09:10.805
<i>alright? Now get.</i>

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960
Go on, <i>get.</i>

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:35.439
GO, get in!

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.680
Yeah, I got good
memories when I was a kid,

01:09:43.682 --> 01:09:45.886
you know, going camping,
playing stickball.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.926
Was great times, man.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.759
Tennis ball or handball?

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.038
Handball, man.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.004
We used to bat... baseball bat.

01:09:54.005 --> 01:09:55.523
It was sewer play to sewer play.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.362
It was your home run, you know?

01:09:57.363 --> 01:09:58.999
And we always
challenged all the kids

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.126
from the neighborhood, you know?

01:10:00.127 --> 01:10:02.399
It was the Boyle
boys versus all.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.879
I don't get it,

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.244
you guys and your
freaking stickball dude.

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:08.368
It seemed like a different
world back then.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.559
Yeah, man.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.039
I got great memories.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.639
Uh, you know, my...

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.483
I remember when my brother
came home from leave,

01:10:17.484 --> 01:10:19.209
go out there in the living room,

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.159
hang out on the carpet

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.969
and we'd play with those
little green army men.

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:24.689
It was the coolest time ever.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.325
- I'll never forget it.
- Yeah.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.639
I miss him.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.239
It was really awesome.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.447
I mean, I got some wonderful
memories up here.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.039
I bet you did.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.925
You kept in touch with
the boys, any at all,

01:10:37.926 --> 01:10:39.279
since you've been back?

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280
My brothers?

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.959
One I think lives near
Portland, Oregon,

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.406
and the other one...

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.645
somewhere in
New York last I heard.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440
How about you?

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:01.920
You know that.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.482
Cassandra was three years old,
Amanda left us.

01:11:04.483 --> 01:11:07.689
Yeah. I know,
but I mean, what happened?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.161
It's tough.
It's tough.

01:11:13.162 --> 01:11:15.128
When Cassandra was born,

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.640
Amanda was...

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.843
she was hooked on drugs, man.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.999
It was really tough.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.639
I mean, when you...

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.679
when you find out your
spouse is cheating on you...

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.884
everything goes south
really quick, man.

01:11:32.885 --> 01:11:35.403
It-it turns everything
completely upside down.

01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:37.082
She took a trip
to New York City,

01:11:37.083 --> 01:11:38.842
hang out with a friend of hers,

01:11:38.843 --> 01:11:40.285
hooked up with this thug, man.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.761
I mean, to say irresponsible
would be a...

01:11:45.762 --> 01:11:47.489
would be a fucking
understatement.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.650
I mean, she turned her back
on her family.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.881
You know how tough it is
being a single parent?

01:11:53.882 --> 01:11:55.245
You know how tough it is

01:11:55.246 --> 01:11:58.679
being me
and raising a little girl?

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.444
You got a great
little girl, man.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.759
I got a good girl,
that girl over there.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760
She's my angel.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.366
Here you go, uncle Roy.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.010
I cut off the ends
like you like.

01:12:11.011 --> 01:12:12.411
Oh man...

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:13.921
thank you.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.280
Thank you.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.806
Look at you.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.881
She's my angel.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.119
You say you got a plan.
Let's hear it.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.120
I got a plan.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.363
For damn sure I've got a plan.

01:12:26.364 --> 01:12:28.169
You know,
my job has got its perks.

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:29.286
Okay?

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.879
I make the rounds.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.844
And through making the rounds,

01:12:32.845 --> 01:12:35.406
I can figure out who has
got the same likes as I do

01:12:35.407 --> 01:12:36.845
or the same dislikes as I do.

01:12:36.846 --> 01:12:38.399
In fact, this Chester,

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.082
he must have an
armament over there.

01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:41.809
Each month,
he gets a new toy in.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.405
Okay, but what
good does that do,

01:12:45.406 --> 01:12:47.524
as if they're meeting
on Chester's land?

01:12:47.525 --> 01:12:50.126
We don't even know if Chester's
down with this or not.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.164
Oh, because Chester's a brother,

01:12:52.165 --> 01:12:53.839
he must be down with it.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.205
Okay, here's a newsflash.

01:12:55.206 --> 01:12:57.119
Sheriff White McWhiteMan

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.043
turned out to be the
head devil in charge.

01:12:59.044 --> 01:13:01.719
So, maybe the brother is clean.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.799
Chester keeps his guns
in a shop in the back

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.040
in this cabinet.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.561
I mean, one time I took
cover from the rain.

01:13:08.562 --> 01:13:10.445
I saw it there.
It's easy to get into.

01:13:10.446 --> 01:13:11.601
He's got an arsenal, man.

01:13:11.602 --> 01:13:13.199
That's an asset.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.087
Okay, but what about
the battleship?

01:13:14.088 --> 01:13:15.161
Yeah, what about that?

01:13:15.162 --> 01:13:16.162
Battleship?

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.971
Okay guys, here's the plan.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.283
Ship's here, okay?
We go in.

01:13:23.284 --> 01:13:25.324
We take out the power
supply instantly.

01:13:25.325 --> 01:13:27.242
It's an old ship.
Everything shuts down.

01:13:27.243 --> 01:13:29.284
Okay? Clear the ship
from bottom to top.

01:13:29.285 --> 01:13:30.845
- Okay.
- That's the plan.

01:13:30.846 --> 01:13:32.725
Right now,
the most important damn thing,

01:13:32.726 --> 01:13:35.403
everybody get their ass
in gear, get out of here,

01:13:35.404 --> 01:13:38.039
grab everything you need and
be back within two hours.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.040
Alright.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.760
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.850
For the love of country.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.881
Shit.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.806
Holy shit.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.681
- You know I'll be back.
- I know that, dad.

01:14:40.682 --> 01:14:42.284
- I love you.
- I love you more.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.879
Hey baby...

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.291
make sure you call uncle Eddie.

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:03.011
<i>Hello?
This is Commander Bower.</i>

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.879
<i>Hi uncle Eddie.</i>

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880
<i>Cassandra?</i>

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.840
<i>Hold on.
TJ's going where?</i>

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.680
<i>Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sending a recon team.</i>

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.320
<i>Don't worry.</i>

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.891
Becca, take the over watch.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.080
Follow the breach, TJ.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.603
Did you bring ball cutters?

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.119
Fuck no, didn't bring them.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.320
Fuck.
Do your thing, bro.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Go, go, go!

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.883
Go, go!
GO, g0, go! GO!

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680
Move!

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.161
Go go go go!

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.200
Fuck!

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.886
James Dean was the man.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.239
Everything he did was cool.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.725
The way he walked was cool.

01:20:42.726 --> 01:20:43.960
The way he talked was cool.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:48.562
The way he smoked too,
it was the coolest.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.525
Can you imagine James Dean

01:20:56.526 --> 01:20:58.199
smoking one of these
fucking things?

01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.560
Absolutely no cool factor,

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.490
you know what I'm saying?

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.163
You must be...
Roy Boyle, right?

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.285
Well, this is a good day.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.922
I was hoping I'd get a
chance to meet you.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.561
Say you used to be
something back in the day.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.006
I mean, personally...

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.687
no offense,

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.250
but I just don't see it, man.

01:21:25.251 --> 01:21:26.366
Alright, man.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:27.881
Let's do this thing.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.890
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.480
Hey!

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.680
Rebecca and Kenny
cleaned the lower deck.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.246
Upper deck's clear.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.846
Corner deck's clear, man.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.890
Thanks for being here for me.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.166
You good?

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:11.600
I'm good.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.159
You good?

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.805
I'm good.
I'll be alright.

01:24:14.806 --> 01:24:16.924
Alright, I'm gonna have
Kenny and Becca.

01:24:16.925 --> 01:24:19.044
Meet us at 0400 hours
at checkpoint.

01:24:19.045 --> 01:24:21.042
- 0400 checkpoint, got you.
- You got it?

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.641
- Yeah.
- Right there.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.923
Let's finish this
thing, goddamnit.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.926
Thomas?

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.319
What's up, man?
Who are all these people?

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.843
What are you doing with
all these equipment, man?

01:25:12.844 --> 01:25:13.844
What's that about?

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.286
I'm sorry for everything.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.480
I'm so sorry.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.406
Alright, secure the perimeter!

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.164
I don't want anybody
getting in or out!

01:25:29.165 --> 01:25:30.889
I want this completely
locked down!

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.521
We have 18 hours to
get to checkpoint B

01:25:36.522 --> 01:25:39.043
in Virginia if that map Larry
put together is correct.

01:25:39.044 --> 01:25:40.679
What about the North Carolina?

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.330
Boat's about 80 miles
an hour and on point.

01:25:42.331 --> 01:25:45.210
No, it's not a boat,
it's a battleship,

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.799
alright?

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.243
Who is our contact in Virginia?

01:25:48.244 --> 01:25:50.561
Malloy.
James Malloy, 1st Cavalry.

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:53.003
I know Malloy. It's good
to know you're friends.

01:25:53.004 --> 01:25:54.490
You better know your enemies.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520
Let's go!

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.241
What in the fuck
have we got into?

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.445
I don't know what the
fuck we got into,

01:26:08.446 --> 01:26:10.408
but I know how the hell
we're getting out of it.

01:26:10.409 --> 01:26:11.999
I got left flank.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.922
Alright, I'll get to them.
Get to them.

01:26:13.923 --> 01:26:14.923
Well, let's do this.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.079
Right up, guys.
You stay close,

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.525
this is going down now.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.280
Contact!

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.839
My ass.

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.639
You're both my bitches.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.520
- Oh, you're back now, huh?
- Come on, let's go!

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:41.881
Cover us, girl.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.770
Reckon you're gonna drop that
weapon you little hussy.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.481
You fucking traitor.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.767
Come on.
Come on!

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.769
Who are you?
Are you one of them?

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.286
I'm a soldier.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.488
Alright, you got a lot
of bleeding here.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.799
I'll be back.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640
Kenny!

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.680
Kenny!

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.759
<i>This is Bishop-36.</i>
