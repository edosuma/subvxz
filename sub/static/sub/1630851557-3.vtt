00:11.762 --> 00:14.181
Hugo, you're not going to believe

00:14.264 --> 00:18.268
the next treasure
that I'm about to unveil from this box.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.318
An old magazine?

00:27.236 --> 00:29.112
Okay, maybe I built it up too much.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.741
So what's the deal with that letter
you were trying to hide from me earlier?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
That letter is not important.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.248
It's an old laundry list of groceries.

00:39.331 --> 00:42.668
How are you, like,
the world's most ruthless corporate mogul,

00:43.168 --> 00:45.003
but also the world's worst liar?

00:45.087 --> 00:48.632
Hugo, I'm full of contradictions.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.592
And also, I'm not.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.470
Come on.

00:53.554 --> 00:57.474
Come on, tell me. Is it, like,
a letter from Julia or something?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.768
Whatever happened to her anyway?

00:59.852 --> 01:01.103
Do you really wanna know?

01:02.229 --> 01:03.939
Well, then play along.

01:04.022 --> 01:08.777
Ask me, "How do I become successful
like the model in this magazine,

01:09.278 --> 01:12.406
known and seen by millions of people?"

01:12.489 --> 01:13.490
Go ahead.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.617
How do I become successful

01:15.701 --> 01:18.912
like those models,
known and seen by millions of people?

01:18.996 --> 01:21.874
I'm so disappointed
that you would ask me that, Hugo.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.003
Success is not about
being seen by millions of people.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.631
Sometimes it comes from not being seen.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.010
One must know when to be visible,

01:34.094 --> 01:36.138
and when to be invisible.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.851
I didn't even know he was there.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.853
And now he's not.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.151
I taught him myself.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.612
And I learned from the best.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.366
It was a very exciting week
at Las Colinas.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.076
A team from Beau Monde magazine

01:58.660 --> 02:00.579
had flown down for a photo shoot.

02:02.873 --> 02:06.210
Bronté. Welcome to Las Colinas.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.836
We're thrilled you're here.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.300
A piece in Beau Monde
is a true honor for the resort.

02:13.383 --> 02:17.012
Yes, well, everyone's saying
that Acapulco is the new Gstaad.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.389
I say that's ridiculous.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.350
Clearly, it's the other way around.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.481
I understand that, and I think it's funny.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.859
This is so cool.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.945
My sisters are obsessed with Beau Monde.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.906
Do you think
they're looking for local models?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.659
Maybe we'll get discovered
and they will put us in a photo spread.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.287
Memo,
I think you would be an amazing model.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.455
I agree.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.542
I'm going to work on my poses
in the laundry room.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.587
Love those shoulder pads.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.756
Real Amazon energy.

02:53.131 --> 02:56.009
Thank you. I had them custom molded.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.220
Let me show you the spa.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.097
The masseuses are from Sweden.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.349
The oils are from Morocco.

03:02.432 --> 03:07.187
And the owner is
from beautiful downtown Burbank, darling.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.438
Right this way.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.776
I can't believe it.
Bronté deFils in our lobby.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.944
I know.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.406
And what is a Bronté deFils?

03:17.489 --> 03:20.534
He's the editor of Beau Monde.
He's, like, the king of fashion.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.704
I wish I could talk to him
about being a designer.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.415
You should come with me
to the banquet tomorrow night as my date.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.958
Wish granted.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.209
-For real?
-Yeah.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.462
But are you sure it would be okay
if I miss work tomorrow?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.298
I know we're already understaffed.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.675
If you're short a server,
I'd love to help out.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.218
My family could use the extra money.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.803
Thanks, buddy. But my mom is, like,

03:39.887 --> 03:43.015
super particular about who she lets
cater her VIP functions.

03:43.098 --> 03:46.643
So the important job
that you're doing right now as a…

03:47.352 --> 03:49.438
-Pool boy.
-Exactly. Just keep doing that.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.152
Bronté would know all about that.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.344
shit!

04:22.888 --> 04:23.889
What do I do?

04:23.972 --> 04:26.391
You said the number one rule
was to never touch you.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.488
You saved my life.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.572
I'm sorry.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.081
That doesn't look like math, girls.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.166
Hi, ma'am.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.168
Hello, Gabriela.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.802
I can't get her off of me
since she lost her job!

05:01.885 --> 05:04.888
How am I supposed to smoke,
watch movies she won't let me see

05:04.972 --> 05:08.308
or sneak out to parties if she doesn't
trust me enough to leave me alone?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.811
She needs someone else to distract her.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.273
Exactly.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.526
My mom would stop bugging me
if she had a boyfriend.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.278
But who?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.405
The kitchen sink's fixed.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.407
Ay, Esteban.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.742
-I forgot you were here.
-Sorry.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.160
I always do that.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.080
My mom used to say that I should wear
a bell around my neck.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.624
In fact, for a while, she put one on me.

05:35.961 --> 05:36.962
Please excuse me.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.839
-Bye.
-Thanks!

05:40.591 --> 05:43.343
Why's that guy from Unit 12
always hanging around here?

05:44.094 --> 05:47.347
I don't know.
He's always fixing things for free.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.974
But focus.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.019
We need to find someone
willing to go out with my mom.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.063
I know you love New York pizza.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.524
So, for your birthday lunch,

05:57.608 --> 06:02.905
I had real New York pizza flown in from…
Go ahead. Guess where.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.573
-New York?
-New York!

06:05.240 --> 06:09.494
We have meat, no meat,
few veggies, extra veggies--

06:09.578 --> 06:11.455
Whatever you want, we have it.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.373
Did you get cauliflower crust?

06:13.832 --> 06:15.876
Remember I can't eat gluten anymore.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.173
We'll have grilled salmon, please.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.806
I knew that it was time to make my move.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.808
If I was going to work that banquet,

06:31.892 --> 06:34.394
I had to show Diane what I was capable of.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.231
Anything you need, Bronté, it's yours.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.069
So, I heard we were understaffed,

06:42.152 --> 06:46.823
and I'd be honored to fill in
and work the banquet tomorrow.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.119
This is for the elite
of the fashion industry.

06:51.203 --> 06:54.665
I need our best people on this.
You ready for that, Héctor?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.041
More than ready, Diane.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.086
I do your exercise tape every morning.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.339
Enough with the flattery.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.302
Which one? Glutes of Gold? Golden Glutes?

07:07.386 --> 07:09.471
Cut the Gut? Leaping Legs?

07:10.222 --> 07:12.057
The one with the purple leg warmers.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.309
Hey, Héctor! Come on! Order up!

07:14.393 --> 07:15.978
You're talking about...

07:16.061 --> 07:18.272
-Bunches of Crunches!
-Crunches! Yeah!

07:18.355 --> 07:19.940
Come on! We're getting backed up here!

07:20.023 --> 07:23.110
You know, I was nominated
for three Diamond Dumbbells for that.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.779
And now,
by the time I reach Ricardo Montalbán,

07:25.863 --> 07:28.282
his face is caked with blood.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.409
-Beto, I got this. Pile it on.
-Are you sure?

07:30.909 --> 07:31.827
All right.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.162
-The plates too.
-Really? Okay.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.126
You got this, kid.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.174
Thanks, man.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.012
-There you go.
-Thank you.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.189
I am telling you, Diane. I can do this.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.859
Me and both my glutes are more than ready.
Here, feel my glutes, please.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.196
Here are your drinks, ladies.
So sorry for the delay.

08:10.574 --> 08:11.575
Máximo.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.328
You seem quite comfortable with that tray.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.413
I do have a lot of experience.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.957
Waited tables at half of the restaurants
along the Escénica.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.125
Really?

08:20.709 --> 08:21.710
Not really.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.672
But I did have experience
balancing glasses on trays.

08:25.756 --> 08:30.594
Shot glasses!
Authentic Acapulco shot glasses!

08:31.345 --> 08:34.681
You know, I do need a little extra help
tomorrow night.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.600
-You do?
-I do.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.770
But keep in mind, if you're not perfect,

08:39.852 --> 08:42.481
you can forget about working
a VIP event again.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.030
As a token of appreciation
for saving my life,

08:50.113 --> 08:55.244
I'm going to let you pick one thing
from the lost and found.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.538
Look.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.794
Pick anything your heart desires.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.089
On the bottom shelf.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.592
I saved your life and I only get to pick
from the bottom shelf?

09:10.676 --> 09:13.428
You should've negotiated with me
while I was choking.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.729
A Rubik's Cube!

09:23.313 --> 09:26.024
When I was kid,
I never got to have my own toys.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.402
Máximo's pendant.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.737
It means so much to him.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.657
He'd be so happy to have it back.

09:34.867 --> 09:35.993
But the Rubik's Cube.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.370
But the pendant.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.122
Hurry up. I don't have all day.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.586
Do the right thing, Memo.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.718
The white one goes here.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.763
Who would my mom be attracted to?

09:58.348 --> 09:59.349
What about that guy?

09:59.933 --> 10:02.561
No, man.
I can already hear what she'd say.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.521
He's too skinny. Why doesn't he eat?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.773
The devil must be living in that belly.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.610
Okay.

10:10.569 --> 10:11.737
What about him?

10:12.237 --> 10:13.405
He's really well-dressed.

10:14.489 --> 10:18.368
Our Lord Jesus Christ only wore a tunic.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.828
Does he think he's better than Jesus?

10:24.708 --> 10:25.834
What about Esteban?

10:26.335 --> 10:27.503
Esteban?

10:28.337 --> 10:29.338
Great idea.

10:29.421 --> 10:33.133
Esteban, can you think of anyone
who'd want to go out with my mom?

10:35.010 --> 10:36.386
Well, I would.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.477
I've been wanting to ask
your mom out for a long time.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.479
Nora is an angel.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.815
Well, if angels lived
on this rough street.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.567
Why haven't you asked her out?

10:50.651 --> 10:54.738
Well, I'm waiting for the right moment.
I want to respect her time of mourning.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.281
My dad died 12 years ago.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.325
You're right. It's too soon.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.826
-No, no, no!
-No!

10:59.910 --> 11:01.537
You should ask her out on a date.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.499
Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't know.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.043
It's… It's a big thing. And I--

11:08.126 --> 11:11.046
Okay. The next time I come over
to your house to fix something,

11:11.129 --> 11:12.422
maybe I'll ask her out.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.217
Excuse me.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.776
Don Pablo.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.655
Good news. I'm waiting tables
at the VIP dinner tomorrow.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.741
Máximo. That's terrible news.

11:39.825 --> 11:42.369
You have no idea what
you've gotten yourself into.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.707
You're not ready to wait tables.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.919
Do you know where the seafood fork goes?

11:52.129 --> 11:54.131
Or which side to pour the wine?

11:54.548 --> 11:57.593
Or how to fold a napkin
in the shape of a swan?

11:58.093 --> 12:00.345
You'll be serving la crème de la crème.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.639
What's the most important thing to know?

12:04.308 --> 12:05.809
The thing about the seafood fork?

12:05.893 --> 12:08.979
No. How to be invisible.

12:09.855 --> 12:13.859
The servant who makes the least impression
makes the best impression.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.986
Do you know how to be invisible?

12:16.945 --> 12:19.615
No. But I can ask my good friend, Camilo.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.160
Camilo, can you teach
me how to be invisible?

12:25.162 --> 12:26.163
Okay.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.665
Camilo says you'll have to teach me.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.668
We'll work on your serving skills.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.921
Then we'll work on your sense of humor.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.218
You crossed the line, Camilo.

12:48.477 --> 12:49.478
Water,

12:49.561 --> 12:51.939
red wine glass, champagne flute.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.693
Sharper creases.
I want to shave with this napkin.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.155
You have to anticipate their needs.

13:00.239 --> 13:02.699
You're waiting on them.
They are not waiting on you.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.660
Master every detail,

13:04.743 --> 13:06.203
no matter how small.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.956
Only then can you truly become invisible.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.417
Again.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.961
Again!

13:17.297 --> 13:20.217
I spent all night practicing.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.845
Where's my eyelash curler?

13:22.928 --> 13:23.929
Sara!

13:27.307 --> 13:30.143
By the next day,
I was starting to get the hang of it.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.813
Water, red wine glass, champagne flute.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.456
Damn it.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.166
I'm never gonna be ready.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.837
You're ready.
No one gets it right with a blindfold.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.257
I just think
it's funny to make people try.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.682
Máximo. I just want you to know

14:08.765 --> 14:11.351
that I am not jealous
of you getting the catering job.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.812
You earned it.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.481
I wish you only good luck for tonight.

14:16.982 --> 14:19.484
Especially when you're preparing
the Fiesta Carajillo.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.361
-Fiesta what?
-Carajillo.

14:21.945 --> 14:22.946
Fiesta Carajillo.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.074
No big deal.
Just a regular coffee cocktail.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.410
Except, of course,
then you light it on fire,

14:28.493 --> 14:31.330
and then pour the flaming liquid
into a small cup three feet away.

14:31.413 --> 14:35.501
Delicious. But very, very, very dangerous.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.962
I just told him all about it.
Said it was a house specialty.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.131
So now, you get to make it for him.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.383
On a windy night.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.220
In the dark.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.099
Good luck, papi.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.977
One mistake in front of Diane,

14:54.061 --> 14:56.813
and your career here
might as well be over.

15:00.234 --> 15:01.235
Hey.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.113
Hey, Máximo.
You're not going to believe it.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.532
So, I was in the laundry room--

15:06.615 --> 15:07.908
-Hey!
-And then--

15:07.991 --> 15:08.992
Move it!

15:09.076 --> 15:10.869
I'm selling aspiration here,

15:10.953 --> 15:12.412
not perspiration.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.583
Memo, I'm in trouble.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.711
I have to serve flaming coffee tonight.
How do I do that?

15:19.795 --> 15:23.549
I know you know that I don't know that.
But, hey, look at thi--

15:23.632 --> 15:25.384
How am I gonna get through tonight?

15:26.260 --> 15:28.554
I wish I had my dad's escapulario
for good luck.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.522
I'm such a bad friend.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.322
Julia! I have a very important question.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.867
Wow.

15:49.950 --> 15:50.951
You made this?

15:51.034 --> 15:54.162
Well, I decided that if
I'm gonna meet the editor of Beau Monde,

15:54.246 --> 15:55.998
I might as well
take advantage of the occasion

15:56.081 --> 15:58.166
and wear one of my own designs.
Don't you think?

16:00.043 --> 16:01.211
Or is it a bad idea?

16:01.795 --> 16:03.380
No, I better not wear it.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.924
Don't worry. The dress is beautiful.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.510
And I'm sure Cruella deFils will love it.

16:08.594 --> 16:09.845
Gracias.

16:13.265 --> 16:14.975
What was your question?

16:15.058 --> 16:17.144
Do you know how to serve
a Fiesta Carajillo?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.606
I'm supposed to serve them in two hours,
and I've never even seen it done.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.942
No, it's fine. It's just a drink.
I'm sure it's not that complicated.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.952
I was so wrong.

16:37.372 --> 16:42.920
Well, I just finished checking and,
no, Sara, I didn't find any leaks, so…

16:43.003 --> 16:44.755
-Great.
-I'm gonna head home.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.089
Sounds good. Thank you.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.427
-If you'll excuse me.
-Yes, bye.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.148
No! Mom!

17:04.733 --> 17:05.817
-What?
-What happened?

17:05.901 --> 17:06.734
No!

17:07.069 --> 17:08.779
Wait! Esteban!

17:09.363 --> 17:10.364
Wait!

17:11.114 --> 17:13.157
-What happened?
-I need you.

17:13.659 --> 17:14.492
Really?

17:15.077 --> 17:16.078
The sink.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.164
Nora.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.417
Norita, I just looked at it. We both know
what you really meant to say is that--

17:23.502 --> 17:25.127
Hell, the sink! That… Yes.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.673
What was I thinking, right?

17:28.464 --> 17:29.550
It seems like--

17:29.633 --> 17:31.260
What happened?

17:41.353 --> 17:42.521
Yeah.

17:42.604 --> 17:43.689
Bravo.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.858
I actually love this.

17:45.941 --> 17:49.319
It is so far beyond camp
that it's wandering around the woods.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.535
To a wonderful magazine spread.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.745
May it be the first of many.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.791
And I hope coming to visit Las Colinas

18:02.875 --> 18:06.295
will always be in fashion.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.381
In fashion. See what I did there?

18:11.842 --> 18:13.260
Yes.

18:15.888 --> 18:19.600
So, is Acapulco everything
you hoped it would be?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.977
Yes. It's all that and more.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.438
I dreaded it would be played out,

18:24.521 --> 18:27.900
all Ricky Ricardo and spangles
and cha-cha-cha.

18:29.735 --> 18:31.278
That's actually Cuban.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.780
But, Diane,
you're doing some glorious things here.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.657
Well, I have a little help.

18:35.741 --> 18:37.910
Chad here is our general manager.

18:37.993 --> 18:42.039
And of course,
our staff is the best in all of Mexico.

18:42.623 --> 18:43.832
They sure are.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.794
I didn't realize that staff
were invited to this dinner.

18:48.587 --> 18:49.963
How egalitarian.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.008
What do you do?

18:53.091 --> 18:55.010
-I work at the front desk.
-Are you serious?

18:55.594 --> 18:57.221
Chad, you fiend!

18:57.304 --> 18:58.305
You're dating the help.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.432
I like to say
she's the face of the resort.

19:00.516 --> 19:03.352
Yeah. I bet you say that to all
the employees that you're dating.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.395
I'm sure with the others
it's just physical.

19:07.022 --> 19:10.359
-I'm bad. It's just a jest, darling.
-All right, yeah, well, let's--

19:10.442 --> 19:14.863
So,
who here's ready for some lobster ceviche?

19:16.114 --> 19:18.367
Will you all excuse me for a second?

19:25.290 --> 19:26.333
It smells good.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.459
Don Pablo.

19:28.836 --> 19:31.463
Do you mind if I take a bathroom break?

19:31.547 --> 19:32.673
It's an emergency.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.220
Remind me to also teach you how to lie.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.930
Go. But be quick.

19:51.608 --> 19:52.609
You okay?

19:53.610 --> 19:55.696
He called me "the help", Máximo.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.492
Is that all I am?

20:02.077 --> 20:03.412
Who cares what that guy says?

20:03.495 --> 20:05.289
Yeah, but it's not just him.

20:05.956 --> 20:08.458
There's a line
that divides "us" and "them",

20:09.209 --> 20:11.628
and maybe I'm a fool
for trying to cross it.

20:15.132 --> 20:18.385
Don't let it get to you, Julia.

20:19.136 --> 20:22.973
You're the smartest person I know.
You read Pride and Precedent.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.142
"Prejudice", Máximo.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.604
Exactly. It's only prejudice.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.440
And you designed your own dress.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.234
It took me 20 minutes
just to put this cummerbund on right.

20:36.153 --> 20:37.613
It's upside down.

20:43.410 --> 20:48.415
Maybe they want us to be invisible,
but you deserve to be seen.

21:00.594 --> 21:01.595
Thanks.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.392
So, should we go back to the banquet?

21:10.145 --> 21:11.146
Let's go.

21:15.901 --> 21:19.905
No, Memo, you made your decision.

21:19.988 --> 21:24.284
Please, please, please let me swap it out.
I made a terrible mistake.

21:24.368 --> 21:26.870
Don't be so pathetic.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.748
Okay, fine. Just this once.

21:30.832 --> 21:31.834
Give me the cube.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.090
Thank you.

21:43.053 --> 21:44.054
Oh, no.

21:45.556 --> 21:49.560
I never dreamed I could
own a game like this.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.988
Memo, do the right thing.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.164
Yay.

22:11.248 --> 22:13.166
I won again.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.881
Okay, well… it's fixed now.

22:18.964 --> 22:24.303
I don't know how it broke
so suddenly and violently.

22:26.138 --> 22:27.890
Thank you so much, Esteban.

22:27.973 --> 22:29.641
I truly don't know
what we'd do without you.

22:29.725 --> 22:31.185
Well...

22:38.483 --> 22:39.526
Okay.

22:45.741 --> 22:47.826
"My dearest Nora,

22:48.619 --> 22:50.787
you are a marvelous woman.

22:51.914 --> 22:53.790
You're so charming and very bro--

22:55.083 --> 22:56.376
very bro--"

22:56.460 --> 22:58.295
Sorry.
The water blurred some of the words.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.714
"Very brotherful"?

23:00.797 --> 23:01.965
That doesn't make any sense.

23:02.049 --> 23:03.926
"Very beautiful." That's for sure.

23:05.260 --> 23:08.055
"You're so charming and very broth--
very beautiful.

23:08.555 --> 23:13.310
I've wanted to ask you out
for a long, long, long,

23:13.393 --> 23:15.103
long, long,

23:15.187 --> 23:16.188
long…

23:17.773 --> 23:20.400
long, long time.

23:21.818 --> 23:26.615
I think I've respectfully waited
long enough to ask you this.

23:27.491 --> 23:28.867
Nora Ramos,

23:28.951 --> 23:31.954
would you go out to eat with me

23:32.037 --> 23:34.540
at a to-be-determined date and time?

23:35.040 --> 23:37.459
Sincerely, Esteban."

23:46.802 --> 23:47.886
Okay.

23:49.388 --> 23:52.015
I don't think it'll kill anyone
if we go out to eat.

23:52.683 --> 23:54.017
Oh, Nora,

23:55.060 --> 24:00.023
you have no idea how long I've dreamed
of hearing you say those very words.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.532
I mean, sure, uptown they're reopening 54,

24:08.615 --> 24:12.494
but without Stevie and his magic powder,
I mean, why bother?

24:13.912 --> 24:14.955
Oh, my gosh.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.416
I mean, he was considered

24:18.041 --> 24:20.711
the enfant terrible
of the prêt-à-porter scene,

24:20.794 --> 24:23.630
but I mean, now he's just terrible.

24:23.714 --> 24:28.177
I mean, he hasn't produced
a single innovative idea in 25 years,

24:28.260 --> 24:31.305
and here he is
with his breakthrough collection,

24:31.388 --> 24:34.641
and it consists of nothing but stripes.
I mean, stripes!

24:39.730 --> 24:43.942
Mr. deFils, I love hearing
all about the New York trends.

24:44.026 --> 24:47.279
Working in fashion is my dream.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.405
Is it?

24:48.488 --> 24:50.949
In fact, this is one of my own designs.

24:51.033 --> 24:52.451
Very Mexican.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.913
If I crack you open,
are you full of candy?

24:56.788 --> 24:58.332
You know what, buddy, I--

25:02.085 --> 25:03.545
I had to do something.

25:03.629 --> 25:05.005
My job was to be invisible,

25:05.088 --> 25:08.050
but I could not stand by
and watch her be insulted like that.

25:17.351 --> 25:18.560
You really did that?

25:19.436 --> 25:22.523
No. That's what I really thought of doing.

25:24.483 --> 25:28.070
But what I actually did,
was make a speech.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.613
Mr. deFils,

25:31.031 --> 25:35.285
this woman has worked hard
to create something true to her heart.

25:35.869 --> 25:39.039
All she wanted was to show it off to you,
her idol.

25:39.915 --> 25:42.251
But you choose to be cruel
and crush her hopes.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.755
You walk around the resort with your nose
in the air like you're better than us,

25:47.256 --> 25:48.340
but you are not.

25:48.882 --> 25:53.720
You're an awful person
with an ugly, ugly tie.

25:58.851 --> 26:00.727
That's actually pretty badass.

26:00.811 --> 26:02.187
Yes, yes.

26:02.813 --> 26:05.274
Except, as soon as I finished,

26:05.357 --> 26:07.150
I realized something.

26:07.234 --> 26:08.569
In my passion,

26:08.652 --> 26:11.530
I had said everything… en español.

26:11.613 --> 26:16.702
You're an awful person
with an ugly, ugly tie.

26:17.661 --> 26:20.247
I'm sorry, I didn't get any of that.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.624
I was saying--

26:22.708 --> 26:26.628
He said what a pleasure
it's been to work at this event.

26:27.254 --> 26:31.216
The entire staff is honored
to have such sophisticated guests

26:31.300 --> 26:35.429
who will no doubt share the good news
about our beautiful resort.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.058
Yes. Yes, we certainly will.

26:44.938 --> 26:47.816
Máximo, quick chat.

26:48.525 --> 26:52.905
And so, my brief time
as an elite waiter came to an end.

26:52.988 --> 26:57.284
I had committed
the cardinal sin of being visible.

26:58.368 --> 27:01.205
Máximo, I told you before what to expect.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.790
This just isn't the right fit for you.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.711
So, I was headed back to the pool.

27:10.881 --> 27:12.299
I went to leave for the night,

27:12.382 --> 27:16.136
wondering why I couldn't just
keep my big mouth shut.

27:16.762 --> 27:18.555
That's when I came across Don Pablo

27:19.056 --> 27:21.558
sitting alone outside his private villa.

27:25.187 --> 27:26.188
Don Pablo.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.734
I'm sorry I let you down.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.653
You ignored my advice.

27:33.278 --> 27:35.239
You're lucky she didn't fire you.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.783
But you did not let me down.

27:40.953 --> 27:43.288
I made it this far by being invisible.

27:45.499 --> 27:48.252
Maybe your destiny is different than mine.

27:48.877 --> 27:51.338
Maybe your destiny is to speak your mind.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.386
I've seen you here before.

27:58.262 --> 27:59.513
May I ask,

28:00.013 --> 28:01.139
are you waiting for someone?

28:01.723 --> 28:03.141
Yes, I am.

28:03.225 --> 28:04.268
Who?

28:05.060 --> 28:06.687
That's none of your business.

28:08.230 --> 28:09.231
Right.

28:24.663 --> 28:27.040
So, what happened to the people
from the magazine?

28:27.124 --> 28:30.002
Well,
their photo spread was a great success.

28:30.085 --> 28:32.171
It boosted the profile of Las Colinas.

28:32.838 --> 28:35.424
And I'd like to think that
that their two newest models...

28:36.550 --> 28:37.593
...helped with that.

28:38.886 --> 28:39.887
Cool.

28:39.970 --> 28:41.305
Thank you, Rolf.

28:43.015 --> 28:44.016
How does he do that?

28:45.809 --> 28:46.894
Anyway…

28:48.228 --> 28:51.064
Still too bad you never got revenge
on that Bronté guy.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.651
Actually…

28:54.735 --> 28:57.946
Again, Diane, you must be so proud

28:58.030 --> 29:02.284
to go from C-list actress
to A-list hotelier. Bravo.

29:02.367 --> 29:04.411
"How did she do this?" might soon replace

29:04.995 --> 29:08.457
"Who's Chad's father?"
as the biggest mystery about you.

29:12.503 --> 29:14.338
Oh, my-- Bloody hell!

29:15.088 --> 29:16.340
Oh, my God!

29:19.176 --> 29:20.552
Help!

29:22.054 --> 29:23.347
Help me!

29:23.430 --> 29:24.973
Did you hear that everyone?

29:25.057 --> 29:28.352
I'm an A-list hotelier.
