00:07.803 --> 00:09.294
When someone's that secretive
about their phone,

00:09.294 --> 00:11.171
it's got to be either porn or a job offer.

00:11.173 --> 00:13.907
Well, it's porn. It's totally porn.

00:13.909 --> 00:16.409
It is a job offer.

00:16.411 --> 00:17.410
Come on. From where?

00:18.413 --> 00:20.046
Somewhere exotic?

00:20.048 --> 00:21.347
Come on, spill.

00:21.349 --> 00:24.951
It's from my old hospital back in Detroit.

00:24.953 --> 00:27.053
And I guess it's exotic in its own way.

00:27.055 --> 00:29.456
Nice! So it takes you back
to old friends and family...

00:29.458 --> 00:31.257
That'd great, huh?

00:31.259 --> 00:33.593
Yeah, my sister did just have twins.

00:33.595 --> 00:34.594
Aww.

00:34.596 --> 00:35.595
And the hospital's offering

00:35.597 --> 00:36.763
to back the money truck up for me, so...

00:36.765 --> 00:38.698
So the upside's pretty obvious.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.733
What's the downside?

00:41.135 --> 00:42.302
I... I kind of...

00:42.304 --> 00:44.170
I kind of like it here, you know?

00:44.172 --> 00:45.572
I think maybe I should stay.

00:45.574 --> 00:47.173
Give this place
a real chance.

00:47.175 --> 00:48.908
Right. I'm needed in the trauma bay.

00:48.910 --> 00:50.176
But maybe you could tell me later

00:50.178 --> 00:52.746
what's the real reason keeping you here.

00:52.748 --> 00:55.348
Or whom. Hmm?

00:55.350 --> 00:56.850
Thank you for the coffee.

01:00.054 --> 01:03.289
Hey, Manny. It's Alex.

01:03.291 --> 01:04.657
Maybe you started your shift already.

01:04.659 --> 01:06.025
I just... I wanted to call to tell you

01:06.027 --> 01:09.596
that I'm sorry that I didn't
say goodbye before I left.

01:09.598 --> 01:11.931
Things have just been crazy
with my mom and everything,

01:11.933 --> 01:13.199
and I just...

01:13.201 --> 01:16.636
I needed some space.

01:16.638 --> 01:19.072
Anyway, I am coming back tonight,

01:19.074 --> 01:20.206
so if you want to,

01:20.208 --> 01:22.675
let's meet after your shift and we can talk.

01:25.312 --> 01:27.981
Oh!

01:27.983 --> 01:30.483
- Mom?
- Ohh!

01:30.485 --> 01:32.652
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:32.654 --> 01:33.953
I'm fine.

01:33.955 --> 01:36.222
I'm fine! It's...

01:36.224 --> 01:37.457
Ugh, it's my own fault

01:37.459 --> 01:39.592
for trying to move
the damn thing by myself.

01:39.594 --> 01:41.227
- Well, are you hurt?
- No.

01:41.229 --> 01:43.630
Oh, it's... the balance
in this room is all off.

01:43.632 --> 01:44.998
I mean, you can just feel it.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.033
Well, you need to be more careful.

01:47.035 --> 01:48.234
Well, if somebody

01:48.236 --> 01:49.836
had cleaned the living room
before like I asked.

01:49.838 --> 01:50.837
Right.

01:50.839 --> 01:52.906
You've been leaving out your papers.

01:52.908 --> 01:53.907
What is this?

01:53.909 --> 01:56.609
Sunny Pines, Manor on the Glen?

01:56.611 --> 01:58.411
- These are palliative care facilities.
- Oh!

01:58.413 --> 02:00.713
I left them out for you, remember?

02:00.715 --> 02:02.382
You... You didn't look at them, did you?

02:02.384 --> 02:05.385
Okay, well, we have
appointments to see them.

02:05.387 --> 02:06.553
When we get back to town,

02:06.555 --> 02:08.420
we need to find ones that you'll like.

02:08.423 --> 02:09.989
No! No, I can't do that.

02:09.991 --> 02:11.524
I... I've got too much to do.

02:11.526 --> 02:13.126
This place is a sty.

02:13.128 --> 02:15.128
No, t-this place is spotless.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.363
Well, if you think that Nick Murphy

02:17.365 --> 02:19.566
isn't gonna judge me for rings on the tables

02:19.568 --> 02:21.668
or dust on the walls,

02:21.670 --> 02:23.169
then you're not gonna be the help to me

02:23.171 --> 02:24.737
that you said you were gonna be.

02:24.739 --> 02:26.206
Okay, I am sorry, Mom.

02:26.208 --> 02:27.674
Who is Nick Murphy?

02:27.676 --> 02:29.843
The real estate agent.

02:29.845 --> 02:33.246
Alex, he's coming to appraise the house.

02:33.248 --> 02:34.414
I told you.

02:34.416 --> 02:35.515
I'm selling it.

02:40.754 --> 02:42.822
Can't I stay just a bit longer?

02:42.824 --> 02:46.259
I don't know how many more ways
I can tell you this, Blake,

02:46.261 --> 02:47.493
but you are dead.

02:47.495 --> 02:49.829
Saw my body on this table.
I totally get that.

02:49.831 --> 02:51.130
But what I'm saying is

02:51.132 --> 02:53.700
why can't I just chill here
a little while longer?

02:53.702 --> 02:54.968
Do whatever you want.

02:54.970 --> 02:57.604
But I can't be talking to you
anymore because I am busy!

02:57.606 --> 03:00.139
Don't make me follow you home.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.542
You...

03:03.844 --> 03:05.979
Does that shelf look level to you?

03:05.981 --> 03:08.314
Wouldn't it fall over if it wasn't?

03:08.316 --> 03:09.649
Hmm.

03:09.651 --> 03:11.517
Not on my watch.

03:11.519 --> 03:13.786
Dr. Harris.

03:13.788 --> 03:15.555
Um, I was wondering
if we could have a little chat,

03:15.557 --> 03:16.623
Chief to Chief.

03:16.625 --> 03:19.158
You mean Interim Chief to Interim Chief?

03:19.160 --> 03:20.393
Nobody listens to me.

03:20.395 --> 03:22.295
Every resident rotation,
every surgery I assign...

03:22.297 --> 03:24.964
Yeah, well, that's... heavy lies the crown.

03:24.966 --> 03:26.566
Such a heavy crown.

03:26.568 --> 03:28.134
- Mm.
- It's hard enough proving

03:28.136 --> 03:29.636
that I deserve the permanent chiefship,

03:29.638 --> 03:32.272
but how do you lead
when no one respects you?

03:32.274 --> 03:33.973
Well, you went from friend
to boss overnight,

03:33.975 --> 03:35.408
so it's not gonna happen right away.

03:35.410 --> 03:37.810
Why, you're not thinking
about stepping down, are you?

03:37.812 --> 03:38.811
No!

03:38.813 --> 03:40.280
Wait. Should I? No.

03:41.449 --> 03:42.982
I am the most qualified.
Dr. Bell even said so.

03:42.984 --> 03:44.550
Yeah, well... Oh, look!

03:44.552 --> 03:46.386
Incoming trauma. Huh.

03:46.388 --> 03:48.021
We will talk about this later.

03:48.023 --> 03:50.323
Right... Chief?

03:50.325 --> 03:51.624
I need you.

03:51.626 --> 03:54.193
Uh, can you be more specific
and less kidnappy, please?

03:54.195 --> 03:55.461
I'm on rounds.

03:55.463 --> 03:57.330
I have an OB admission,
but she won't let me examine her

03:57.332 --> 03:58.731
or Dr. Rosen, who's on call.

03:58.733 --> 03:59.732
She wants a woman.

03:59.734 --> 04:01.434
Actually, Dr. Lin, she wants you.

04:01.436 --> 04:04.070
Mrs. Friedman, Dr. Lin.

04:04.072 --> 04:05.638
Thank you for your time, Dr. Scott.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.708
Okay, Mrs. Friedman,
I see you're 14 weeks pregnant

04:08.710 --> 04:11.344
and receiving chemotherapy
for ovarian cancer.

04:11.346 --> 04:13.279
Tumor showed up in my ultrasound.

04:13.281 --> 04:15.515
I was supposed to have surgery,
but it already spread.

04:15.517 --> 04:17.149
They backed off and biopsied.

04:17.152 --> 04:18.651
Stage 2.

04:18.653 --> 04:20.519
She's been on mild chemo to control growth

04:20.522 --> 04:21.553
till the baby's viable.

04:21.555 --> 04:22.889
It sounds like a plan.

04:22.891 --> 04:25.325
Why you'd move from
Summer Hill Memorial to see me?

04:25.327 --> 04:26.426
Your cancer study.

04:26.428 --> 04:28.962
My sister's a doctor. She told me about it.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.930
I want to enroll, Dr. Lin.

04:30.932 --> 04:32.332
May I ask who your sister is?

04:33.601 --> 04:35.301
The pain's worse.

04:35.303 --> 04:37.770
It's just a wave. A-A bad one.

04:37.772 --> 04:39.105
Okay. Keep breathing slow.

04:39.107 --> 04:40.473
I am!

04:40.475 --> 04:42.308
Slower, Rivka. Slow down.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:53.188 --> 04:54.287
Hey.

04:54.289 --> 04:56.389
We got a John Doe, possible transient.

04:56.391 --> 04:58.291
Decided to go for a stroll
in a subway tunnel.

04:58.293 --> 04:59.959
Poor guy. Was he living down there?

04:59.961 --> 05:02.428
Unclear. Definite thoracic trauma.

05:02.430 --> 05:03.830
Left tibia's broken in two places

05:03.832 --> 05:04.897
and likely pelvic fracture.

05:04.899 --> 05:05.965
Yeah, internal injuries,

05:05.967 --> 05:08.234
but no major bleeding I can see so far.

05:09.837 --> 05:11.304
Okay, he needs an MRI right away.

05:11.306 --> 05:13.539
His pupils are sluggish.
This could be a brain bleed.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.274
All right, Dr. Hamza's got dibs.

05:15.276 --> 05:17.310
Let's get him up to imaging. Let's go!

05:21.015 --> 05:22.281
Oh.

05:22.283 --> 05:24.517
In the meantime,
you better take a look at this.

05:24.519 --> 05:26.119
I found it in his pocket.

05:49.045 --> 05:51.437
Impressive, Dr. Sekara.

05:51.439 --> 05:53.406
I didn't master
sleeping while standing up

05:53.408 --> 05:54.574
until third year.

05:54.576 --> 05:56.075
You don't mind, do you?

05:56.077 --> 05:57.877
Bold move.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.078
I should put you on abscess duty.

06:00.781 --> 06:02.348
Hey, hey. Be cool. I can't deal right now.

06:02.350 --> 06:03.383
What?

06:04.618 --> 06:06.052
Nurse Cabrera.

06:06.054 --> 06:07.920
Dr. Miller.

06:07.922 --> 06:09.389
Is Dr. Sekara around?

06:09.391 --> 06:12.125
Uh, last I saw,

06:12.127 --> 06:14.594
I think he was in the middle
of a fairly dramatic enema.

06:14.596 --> 06:16.663
Oh. Should I interrupt?

06:16.665 --> 06:18.498
Probably not.

06:22.670 --> 06:24.103
I got it.

06:25.339 --> 06:27.140
Here you go.

06:27.142 --> 06:29.208
Tell him I'm looking for him.

06:33.281 --> 06:34.480
We've been, uh

06:34.482 --> 06:38.184
dating a few weeks now, and, uh...

06:38.186 --> 06:39.352
I can't keep up.

06:39.354 --> 06:41.354
If we're not on a shift,
we're on a dance floor.

06:41.356 --> 06:42.989
I don't know how she does it.

06:42.991 --> 06:44.190
I'm sorry. You're complaining?

06:44.192 --> 06:45.625
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Screw off!

06:45.627 --> 06:47.226
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.

06:47.228 --> 06:48.828
- The line for this club is...
- You can't... You can't come in here.

06:48.830 --> 06:50.430
- What are you, the boun...
- You're not supposed to come in here.

06:50.432 --> 06:52.065
What are you, the bouncer?

06:52.067 --> 06:53.266
I'll have a double vodka.

06:53.268 --> 06:54.534
He said he was having chest pains.

06:54.536 --> 06:55.968
Just leave me with the bartender.

06:55.970 --> 06:57.570
Sir, it's 9:30 A.M.

06:57.572 --> 06:59.505
Well, then, to Kensington then, my man!

06:59.507 --> 07:02.709
The after-hours bars are calling my name.

07:02.711 --> 07:04.010
Look, I don't know this guy,

07:04.012 --> 07:05.144
but 20 minutes ago,

07:05.146 --> 07:07.647
he said he was dying in the back of my cab.

07:07.649 --> 07:09.015
This is for the cab,

07:09.017 --> 07:10.683
and this is for the gyro
you dumped in my back seat.

07:10.685 --> 07:12.352
Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute.

07:12.354 --> 07:13.653
I want my leftovers back!

07:13.655 --> 07:15.121
Party machines need fuel. Whoa!

07:15.123 --> 07:17.690
Okay, pump the brakes there, Keith Richards.

07:17.692 --> 07:19.325
Let's find out if you're really dying.

07:19.327 --> 07:20.927
Where's that vodka?

07:20.929 --> 07:23.396
I flew home
right after Becca was diagnosed.

07:23.398 --> 07:24.797
And when I looked into treatment options,

07:24.799 --> 07:26.666
I came across your study with Dr. Reid.

07:26.668 --> 07:27.934
it's impressive work.

07:27.936 --> 07:29.202
Thanks.

07:29.204 --> 07:31.037
Can you help her?

07:31.039 --> 07:33.439
Sydney said my pathology fit your criteria,

07:33.441 --> 07:34.540
even though I'm pregnant.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.142
Right now, I just want to focus

07:36.144 --> 07:37.777
on what's causing all this pain.

07:37.779 --> 07:39.345
With Syd's counsel, of course.

07:39.347 --> 07:41.080
I don't... I don't think
that's a very good idea.

07:41.082 --> 07:44.183
No. I'm just here
to help get her admitted.

07:44.185 --> 07:45.918
My parents are on the way
with Becca's husband.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.287
Mary, could you get Mrs. Friedman

07:48.289 --> 07:50.123
something more for her pain?

07:50.125 --> 07:51.357
You just stay comfortable.

07:51.359 --> 07:53.359
I'll be right around the corner
if you need anything.

08:00.434 --> 08:01.434
I'm so sorry.

08:01.436 --> 08:04.237
Yeah.

08:04.239 --> 08:06.839
It's been a rough year for the Katz family

08:06.841 --> 08:09.108
starting with me.

08:10.979 --> 08:13.346
Since I came out, my mother actually thinks

08:13.348 --> 08:15.648
I gave the whole family an Ayin Hara,

08:15.650 --> 08:17.250
you know, "the evil eye."

08:17.252 --> 08:18.785
Oh, come on.

08:18.787 --> 08:20.520
Old World Jewish curses, Maggie.

08:20.522 --> 08:22.021
It's very serious stuff.

08:25.859 --> 08:28.561
So, Becca's treatment plan...

08:28.563 --> 08:30.596
You have room for her in your study?

08:30.598 --> 08:34.866
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

08:34.869 --> 08:36.001
The study's over.

08:36.004 --> 08:38.638
They started a new phase
at Mississauga Memorial,

08:38.640 --> 08:42.808
but it's only open to existing patients.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.113
That's disappointing news.

08:47.115 --> 08:49.115
Yeah.

08:49.117 --> 08:51.083
At least she'll still have you.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.253
I'm not sure what I can do

08:54.255 --> 08:57.457
that her last doctor didn't think of.

08:57.459 --> 09:00.059
- You really can't stay?
- No.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.061
My parents have made it very clear

09:02.063 --> 09:03.496
that they don't want me here.

09:03.498 --> 09:05.932
In fact, it's probably better for Becca

09:05.934 --> 09:07.633
if I head out before they arrive.

09:09.670 --> 09:12.505
You look good, Maggie.

09:25.886 --> 09:28.087
I put on a pelvic binder
as a temporary measure

09:28.089 --> 09:29.555
till I can get the ex-fix on.

09:29.557 --> 09:31.557
Well, you bought us time to deal
with the thoracic trauma.

09:31.559 --> 09:32.825
Thank you.

09:32.827 --> 09:34.627
We're gonna need to keep an eye
on his pressure

09:34.629 --> 09:35.962
until we can get him back to you.

09:35.964 --> 09:38.397
In the meantime,

09:38.399 --> 09:41.234
any ideas as to how your name
got in his book?

09:41.236 --> 09:43.703
No idea. Maybe an old patient?

09:44.571 --> 09:46.472
It's all over the place.

09:46.474 --> 09:48.941
Different writing, different voices.

09:48.943 --> 09:50.476
Maybe Dissociative Identity Disorder?

09:50.478 --> 09:51.677
Yeah, I paged Psych,

09:51.679 --> 09:53.479
so let's see what they have to say.

09:53.481 --> 09:54.580
There's got to be someone out there

09:54.582 --> 09:55.681
that cares where this guy is.

09:55.683 --> 09:58.050
Is there any other names in there to go on?

09:58.052 --> 10:00.953
Yeah. We have...

10:00.955 --> 10:02.488
Esther Leach,

10:02.490 --> 10:05.925
Vin Tranh,

10:05.927 --> 10:08.494
Randall Crane, Maria Jara...

10:08.496 --> 10:10.196
Wait a second.
Did you say Randall Crane?

10:10.198 --> 10:12.298
W-Why does that name sound familiar?

10:12.300 --> 10:13.799
Uh...

10:16.336 --> 10:18.604
Actually, he's... he's been here before.

10:18.606 --> 10:19.605
A few times.

10:19.607 --> 10:20.840
Wait.

10:20.842 --> 10:22.675
It's that psychic
who messed with Alex's head

10:22.677 --> 10:23.676
when you were in a coma.

10:23.678 --> 10:24.810
Uh-huh.

10:24.812 --> 10:26.312
Okay, well, maybe we should contact him.

10:26.314 --> 10:27.847
- Yeah.
- No, I'm...

10:27.849 --> 10:31.617
I'm starting to think
that this is him.

10:33.621 --> 10:35.688
God! How did he end up like this?

10:35.690 --> 10:38.958
That is an excellent question.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.359
Would you like to come
and hear the answer now?

10:45.499 --> 10:46.666
You're quiet.

10:46.668 --> 10:48.801
You don't approve.

10:48.803 --> 10:51.037
Mom, I'm just surprised.

10:51.039 --> 10:52.238
It's a... It's a great time to sell.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.740
I just thought you were putting things off.

10:54.742 --> 10:59.111
I'm not putting anything off.

10:59.113 --> 11:01.414
Well, I am glad that
you're facing this head-on.

11:01.416 --> 11:03.115
We'll choose a care home that you like,

11:03.117 --> 11:04.817
somewhere close to me.

11:04.819 --> 11:06.218
It will be great.

11:06.220 --> 11:09.221
There's no need to bother
about any of those places.

11:09.223 --> 11:10.289
We talked about this, mother.

11:10.291 --> 11:11.757
What do you mean?

11:14.329 --> 11:17.396
I've done a lot of thinking, Alex,

11:17.398 --> 11:19.131
and I want to die here.

11:19.133 --> 11:22.168
I don't want to wait.

11:22.170 --> 11:24.337
And I want you to help me.

11:26.341 --> 11:28.274
You want me to help you die?

11:30.444 --> 11:32.411
There's Nick.

11:33.747 --> 11:34.880
Thinner, sweetie.

11:34.882 --> 11:38.517
He's a real estate agent, not a farm animal.

11:44.454 --> 11:48.991
Martha, you completely undersold
how adorable this place is.

11:48.993 --> 11:52.495
And is that Alex Reid,
or do my eyes deceive me?

11:53.865 --> 11:55.665
- How have you been, girl?
- Good.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.433
It's been what, 20 years?

11:57.435 --> 11:59.869
You remember Nick, don't you, Alex?

11:59.871 --> 12:01.003
St. Regis High.

12:01.005 --> 12:03.706
I asked you to the prom.

12:03.708 --> 12:05.374
And you said no?

12:05.376 --> 12:07.710
Oh, you were so adorable, Nick.

12:07.712 --> 12:10.279
He was so persistent.
He kept calling and calling.

12:10.281 --> 12:12.114
He was even hanging around
outside the house.

12:12.116 --> 12:14.650
Oh, I definitely remember you now.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.352
So let me show you the place.

12:16.354 --> 12:18.888
Uh, actually, Nick, we need to reschedule.

12:18.890 --> 12:21.591
Oh, you know, I think
that I forgot to tell Alex

12:21.593 --> 12:22.925
that you were coming today.

12:22.927 --> 12:24.660
And, you know, selling the place,

12:24.662 --> 12:26.963
she needs some time to adjust.

12:26.965 --> 12:28.097
You feel like you're selling

12:28.099 --> 12:29.632
your memories with your house, Alex.

12:29.634 --> 12:30.633
I get it.

12:30.635 --> 12:32.268
I don't think you do, Nick.

12:33.370 --> 12:35.838
How about you, uh,
start to take a look around?

12:35.840 --> 12:37.807
We'll catch up to you.

12:40.844 --> 12:44.413
Mother, uh...

12:44.415 --> 12:46.182
We need to talk about this.

12:46.184 --> 12:47.750
Not now, Alex.

12:47.752 --> 12:49.619
- We have a guest.
- Not later!

12:49.621 --> 12:50.820
Now, mother.

12:50.822 --> 12:51.921
You see?

12:51.923 --> 12:53.890
This is why
I didn't want to ask you.

12:53.892 --> 12:55.524
Because I knew you'd get like this.

12:55.526 --> 12:56.659
Get like what?

12:58.161 --> 12:59.562
You're always so dramatic.

12:59.564 --> 13:01.697
I'm the one being dramatic right now?

13:01.699 --> 13:04.367
You think that I actually
want to kill myself

13:04.369 --> 13:06.502
in front of our real estate agent?

13:06.504 --> 13:08.771
That would shave $50,000
off the list price easy.

13:08.773 --> 13:10.573
It's not funny.

13:10.575 --> 13:13.009
It's a little funny.

13:13.011 --> 13:16.379
Oh, I don't want him to see
the water stain in the en suite.

13:22.587 --> 13:25.554
Hey! Charlie!

13:25.556 --> 13:27.056
You look great, man.

13:27.058 --> 13:28.124
Really great.

13:28.126 --> 13:29.258
Let me guess.

13:29.260 --> 13:31.961
You, too, are off gluten
and refined sugars, huh?

13:33.298 --> 13:34.463
No, wait a minute.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.532
I'm sensing
it's something else with you.

13:36.534 --> 13:37.667
What is it?

13:37.669 --> 13:39.802
No carbs or dairy.

13:39.804 --> 13:41.637
Except for cheese.

13:41.639 --> 13:43.506
I mean, everybody cheats with cheese, so.

13:43.508 --> 13:44.807
Yeah.

13:44.809 --> 13:46.976
You're pretty funny for a guy
who just got hit by a train.

13:46.978 --> 13:49.078
Yeah. Mm.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.880
Went down there
for a little peace and quiet.

13:50.882 --> 13:54.116
A little respite from our mutual friends.

13:54.118 --> 13:55.885
Didn't turn out so good.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.388
Caught a look at your journal, Randall.

13:59.390 --> 14:00.589
Why was my name in it?

14:00.591 --> 14:02.925
Because of the changes.

14:02.927 --> 14:04.927
Changes? What changes?

14:04.929 --> 14:06.095
Last time I talked to you,

14:06.097 --> 14:07.863
you said you didn't see them anymore.

14:07.865 --> 14:11.901
Yeah, well, that didn't last.

14:11.903 --> 14:13.703
Not so long.

14:13.705 --> 14:15.504
They couldn't quit me.

14:15.506 --> 14:16.772
I mean, come on.

14:16.774 --> 14:18.007
Could you quit me?

14:18.009 --> 14:19.342
Huh?

14:19.344 --> 14:21.010
I'm about to quit this conversation.

14:21.012 --> 14:23.145
Okay, okay. Fine, fine, fine.

14:24.381 --> 14:26.082
It started slowly at first.

14:26.084 --> 14:28.017
And I was doing great.
I was doing really good.

14:28.019 --> 14:29.118
I was getting along with my daughter.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.453
I was a granddad.

14:31.756 --> 14:33.356
And then, um...

14:33.358 --> 14:34.957
Well, you know,

14:34.959 --> 14:37.360
a little whisper here,
a little shadow there,

14:37.362 --> 14:39.695
and then one day, it was just... kapow!

14:39.697 --> 14:40.696
Kapow?

14:40.698 --> 14:42.031
Oh, kapow.

14:42.033 --> 14:44.767
Everything gets turned up to 11.

14:44.769 --> 14:47.503
You still haven't told me
what this is about.

14:49.106 --> 14:52.174
Look, man.

14:52.176 --> 14:53.509
I always thought I could control this.

14:53.511 --> 14:55.745
You know that.

14:55.747 --> 14:58.948
Eventually, I found out it controls you.

14:58.950 --> 15:00.516
I tried to get away from it.

15:00.518 --> 15:04.754
I ran down to a subway and

15:04.756 --> 15:07.189
So...

15:07.191 --> 15:09.425
When you find out you can't shake it,

15:09.427 --> 15:10.893
that's how it starts.

15:13.563 --> 15:16.699
What's left of me in there,
that's how it ends.

15:19.536 --> 15:21.837
Randall's craniotomy was a success.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.340
His pressure was dropping
when I was closing.

15:24.342 --> 15:25.783
I'm worried the thoracic bleed

15:25.783 --> 15:28.411
may be not as minor as we suspected.

15:28.413 --> 15:29.845
You sure we don't want to crack him open?

15:29.847 --> 15:31.747
No. He's been through too much.

15:31.749 --> 15:33.749
Let's keep it minimal.

15:33.751 --> 15:37.053
EVAR was a good call. Thank you, Dr. Hamza.

15:37.055 --> 15:38.654
Yes, fine. Just keep me updated.

15:41.892 --> 15:44.960
I'm really starting to think
that guy doesn't like me.

15:44.962 --> 15:46.796
Who? Shahir?

15:46.798 --> 15:48.531
He doesn't like change.

15:48.533 --> 15:50.332
And you and Alex are change.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.271
Look. She's my best friend.

15:55.273 --> 15:56.672
Do you think
she wouldn't mention you?

15:56.674 --> 15:58.274
Needle.

16:01.078 --> 16:02.912
So, you never told me...

16:02.914 --> 16:05.581
You got a job offer that
takes you back to your family

16:05.583 --> 16:08.517
and a pile of money to sweeten the deal...

16:10.287 --> 16:14.090
So, what is keeping you here?

16:14.092 --> 16:16.892
Does is rhyme with Alex Reid?

16:16.894 --> 16:18.861
I can totally hear you, by the way?

16:21.131 --> 16:23.432
Look, I know what you're gonna say.

16:23.434 --> 16:25.768
It's a crazy time right now for her.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.203
Do you know
how many people have tried

16:27.205 --> 16:28.304
to "helpfully" tell me this?

16:28.306 --> 16:30.372
Implying you are the rebound guy.

16:31.609 --> 16:34.176
Look, I'm just not big
on collecting regrets.

16:34.178 --> 16:36.946
And if I don't give it a try with her,

16:36.948 --> 16:39.915
I will have one.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.717
Manny, I'm gonna tell you something

16:41.719 --> 16:43.919
that you might not want to hear.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.387
I know Alex,

16:45.389 --> 16:47.656
and she and Charlie
are the long-term picture here.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.091
They just are.

16:49.093 --> 16:50.292
Maybe that picture's changing.

16:50.294 --> 16:51.460
They have a kid together.

16:51.462 --> 16:53.262
That's something that never changes.

16:58.135 --> 16:59.602
Where is my phone?

17:02.572 --> 17:04.240
I need a cab.

17:09.579 --> 17:10.945
It's not single malt,

17:10.948 --> 17:13.348
but it does go great with root beer.

17:13.351 --> 17:14.583
Come on.

17:14.585 --> 17:16.352
How long you been going like this?

17:16.354 --> 17:18.119
Not long enough.

17:18.122 --> 17:19.622
Don't love his pressure, Dr. Miller,

17:19.624 --> 17:20.789
but it might just be all the partying.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.925
I know what you're doing here, Wilfred.

17:22.926 --> 17:24.460
You don't know anything, kid.

17:24.462 --> 17:26.162
It's not your first time here.

17:26.164 --> 17:29.698
You were admitted six months ago
after your wife died.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.901
I treated you. You thought you were dying.

17:31.903 --> 17:34.003
Turned out to be
an extreme grief reaction.

17:34.005 --> 17:35.971
I can't stop you from doing
what you're doing, Wilfred,

17:35.973 --> 17:37.006
but I can slow you down.

17:37.008 --> 17:39.675
Dr. Sekara, let's get an chest X-Ray,

17:39.677 --> 17:40.843
echo, and full blood panels.

17:40.845 --> 17:42.311
Look at yourself.

17:42.313 --> 17:45.314
Looks like they put a white coat on a turd.

17:45.316 --> 17:47.316
Dr. Miller, he's got an arrhythmia.

17:47.318 --> 17:48.651
Okay.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.554
You're mine now, Willy.

17:51.556 --> 17:53.189
Buckle up.

17:55.859 --> 17:58.861
To a beautiful future.

17:58.863 --> 18:01.864
Your mother's just agreed to let
me represent her in her sale.

18:01.866 --> 18:02.865
Well...

18:02.867 --> 18:03.866
Let's get you a glass.

18:03.868 --> 18:05.568
No. No, thank you.

18:07.438 --> 18:09.105
Martha, I have to ask...

18:09.107 --> 18:10.139
This place is paradise.

18:10.141 --> 18:11.340
Why do you want to sell?

18:11.342 --> 18:13.710
Well, you know,
after my husband passed,

18:13.712 --> 18:15.878
I... I needed a change,

18:15.880 --> 18:19.215
so I moved out here
and packed up the kids and...

18:19.217 --> 18:21.384
But now, I...

18:21.386 --> 18:23.920
I'm the only one rattling around here,

18:23.922 --> 18:26.889
and I want a new adventure.

18:26.891 --> 18:30.259
Sounds exciting. Where?

18:30.261 --> 18:32.128
The Greek islands.

18:32.130 --> 18:35.665
I want... I've always wanted
to go to the Greek islands.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.900
Nick, I think we should
finish this up later.

18:37.902 --> 18:39.235
My mother's had a long day.

18:39.237 --> 18:40.470
Oh, no! I'm fine.

18:40.472 --> 18:42.338
No, Nick. Please.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

18:42.340 --> 18:44.040
I-I want to hear everything

18:44.042 --> 18:45.675
that's been going on with you
for the last 20 years,

18:45.677 --> 18:48.878
ever since my daughter blew it with you.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.515
Martha, I really should be going.

18:52.517 --> 18:54.417
I have a billboard I have to sign off on.

18:55.619 --> 18:56.652
Oh, come on.

18:56.654 --> 18:58.321
The party's just getting started.

18:58.323 --> 19:01.891
Alex, you go up and call
your father and your brothers

19:01.893 --> 19:04.260
and tell them to come down
and bring the music box,

19:04.262 --> 19:05.595
and... and...

19:05.597 --> 19:06.763
Oh, it's... You should he... he...

19:06.765 --> 19:07.964
Oh!

19:07.966 --> 19:10.733
Mom. Mom? Okay.
All right, Mama. I got you.

19:10.735 --> 19:12.335
Just sit back down.

19:12.337 --> 19:13.636
I'm here. I'm here with you.

19:13.638 --> 19:15.371
- You're gonna be okay.
- What's wrong with her?

19:15.373 --> 19:18.241
I've got her. You just need to go, okay?

19:19.511 --> 19:21.778
Hey. Mama, I got you.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.981
I got you. You're gonna be okay.

19:24.983 --> 19:27.550
What do you mean, the study's over?

19:27.552 --> 19:29.051
There's nothing that we can do?

19:30.454 --> 19:32.121
You said it would be better here.

19:32.123 --> 19:34.056
You said they would save me and my baby!

19:34.058 --> 19:35.358
No, I never said that.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.426
Mom and Dad are right.
This was a huge mistake.

19:38.729 --> 19:40.429
I'm the next best thing to Sydney.

19:40.431 --> 19:41.464
She trained me.

19:41.466 --> 19:43.032
Oh, so you were there when she decided

19:43.034 --> 19:45.134
to upend her life and drop
a bomb on our entire family?

19:45.136 --> 19:46.803
I didn't exactly decide.

19:46.805 --> 19:48.171
You didn't tell me!

19:48.173 --> 19:51.307
You didn't say anything to me!

19:53.944 --> 19:55.478
I'm sorry.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.981
I'm sorry. I'm just...

19:58.983 --> 20:00.183
I'm scared.

20:01.151 --> 20:02.718
I've had four miscarriages already.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.086
What am I gonna do?

20:04.088 --> 20:06.789
Okay. We're gonna continue
with a basic chemo cocktail

20:06.791 --> 20:08.491
that doesn't hurt the baby.

20:08.493 --> 20:10.092
You're still 10 weeks from viability,

20:10.094 --> 20:11.093
so we have plenty of...

20:11.095 --> 20:13.196
Becca.

20:13.198 --> 20:14.931
What's happening?

20:14.933 --> 20:16.332
It must be where the mass is.

20:16.334 --> 20:18.601
Okay. Rivka, I'm right here.

20:18.603 --> 20:19.836
I'm right here with you.

20:22.173 --> 20:24.707
- Her pressure's way low.
- The tumor must be hemorrhaging.

20:24.709 --> 20:25.708
Book me an O.R.

20:28.946 --> 20:30.580
Syd. I've got her.

20:37.469 --> 20:38.569
This procedure is risky.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.071
Is Dr. Katz the kind of friend

20:40.073 --> 20:42.173
that could forgive you
if something goes wrong?

20:42.175 --> 20:43.775
I hope we don't have to find out.

20:43.777 --> 20:45.843
- What's her story, anyway?
- Ask her yourself.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.979
Dr. Katz, this is Dr. Scott.

20:47.981 --> 20:49.280
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.884
So, um... Oh.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.055
Okay, there's gonna be lots of blood,

20:57.057 --> 20:58.189
so it'll be hard to see.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.724
If you hit the uterus with the trocars,

20:59.726 --> 21:01.192
it's a bad outcome for both of them.

21:01.194 --> 21:02.727
You think I should do a laparotomy?

21:02.729 --> 21:03.961
No.

21:03.963 --> 21:04.996
I don't know.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.798
Just be sure
to remove the ovary intact

21:06.800 --> 21:08.032
because
if the tumor ruptures...

21:08.034 --> 21:09.233
The cancer can spread everywhere.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.401
I know. I'll be careful.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.070
Maggie, if you run into any complications,

21:12.072 --> 21:13.771
I want you to be aggressive, okay?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.406
Even at greater risk to the baby.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.408
Even with all
the miscarriages she's had?

21:17.410 --> 21:18.409
Yeah.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.477
Becca isn't thinking about herself,

21:19.479 --> 21:20.812
and someone needs to.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.080
Go. Be with her.

21:25.684 --> 21:27.452
I can't lose the baby. I can't.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.786
You won't.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.322
You do this, it's your job,

21:31.324 --> 21:33.124
but you don't know what it's like.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.759
Nothing else matters.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.527
You matter.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.528
Hey.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.697
You matter to me.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.700
You're my sister, and I shut you out.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.736
That wasn't your fault.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.004
I should have said something.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.873
I should have defended you,
but I said nothing.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.709
I said nothing when you were blamed

21:51.711 --> 21:53.411
for breaking the Shabbat candlesticks.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.146
I knew that was you.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.083
We'll call it even.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.955
Okay. Time to go.

22:10.028 --> 22:12.930
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.765
Nick must think I'm crazy.

22:14.767 --> 22:15.867
You had a seizure.

22:15.869 --> 22:17.301
It won't be the last one.

22:18.972 --> 22:20.238
How is that feeling?

22:20.240 --> 22:22.740
It's supposed to help your muscles relax.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.308
It feels nice.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.348
You're gonna need some full-time care soon.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.651
Oh, don't spoil it.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.686
I'm mothering you.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.288
Yes, you are.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.026
I miss Luke.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.795
I know.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.464
Me, too.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.735
Why did you have to name him that?

22:52.704 --> 22:54.438
To remember.

22:57.009 --> 23:01.712
I'm gonna forget it all soon, aren't I?

23:01.714 --> 23:04.315
My children, my life.

23:04.317 --> 23:06.050
Myself.

23:06.052 --> 23:09.353
You still have time.

23:09.355 --> 23:13.658
But we won't know how much time
until there's none left.

23:18.664 --> 23:21.265
Let's do something.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.633
A puzzle.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.369
Oh, you hate puzzles.

23:25.371 --> 23:26.837
I do.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.540
But you love them.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.243
And I want to spend time with my mother.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.614
Right at the last second,
it's total slow-motion.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.216
Total slow-motion and...

23:38.218 --> 23:40.151
Oh, hey, Charlie.

23:40.153 --> 23:42.787
Didn't feel a thing.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.160
Randall.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.396
Blake.

23:57.703 --> 23:58.736
What's up, guys?

23:58.738 --> 24:00.771
Uh, I was talking to your friend here,

24:00.773 --> 24:03.207
sharing some old war stories.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.543
How the gorgeous Dr. Reid
cured me of cancer,

24:05.545 --> 24:06.811
how you're just about to fix

24:06.813 --> 24:08.512
whatever's busted up in me in there.

24:08.514 --> 24:09.714
Maybe you can cure me, too.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.349
You're dead, Blake.

24:11.351 --> 24:12.350
Dead.

24:12.352 --> 24:14.518
I prefer life-challenged, okay?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.654
Blake, if you could, uh, excuse us.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.625
I-I don't know.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.528
So, Randall, I talked to your daughter.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.797
She's not coming.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.166
Yeah.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.802
We had a bumpy ride, Leslie and me.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.538
So she's finally decided to jump off.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.906
There's always another chance.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.609
Come on.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.778
Another chance, another chance, another...

24:40.780 --> 24:42.380
Used to always think so.

24:42.382 --> 24:44.649
Then, uh...

24:44.651 --> 24:46.117
Anyway.

24:46.119 --> 24:47.184
If I don't make it through this,

24:47.186 --> 24:48.286
you'll tell her I love her, right?

24:48.288 --> 24:49.353
Come on, Randall.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.355
Every time you've walked into this place,

24:51.357 --> 24:53.257
you somehow manage to walk out okay.

24:53.259 --> 24:54.825
Maybe so.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.763
But if you're not careful, buddy,

24:58.765 --> 25:00.965
you're gonna end up
in a bloody mess like this, too.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.434
Randall, I'm not you.

25:03.436 --> 25:05.670
And I know you're trying
to scare me or whatever,

25:05.672 --> 25:06.904
but I'm... I'm doing fine.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.944
Having trouble sending him on his way?

25:13.946 --> 25:15.313
I'm working on that.

25:15.315 --> 25:16.547
You know, it's hard to pull off

25:16.549 --> 25:18.049
a creepy clown vibe without the costume,

25:18.051 --> 25:19.383
but he's really nailed it.

25:19.385 --> 25:21.118
Yeah.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.486
It's nothing I can't handle.

25:22.488 --> 25:23.621
I'm sure you can.

25:23.623 --> 25:27.792
But who's gonna tie you to the living, hmm?

25:27.794 --> 25:31.395
You know you can't do it alone.

25:31.397 --> 25:33.130
So, who?

25:33.132 --> 25:34.832
Oh, there you go.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.835
Saved by the bell.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.304
I need to scrub in for your surgery.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.975
Un-break a leg in there.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.410
Sorry. It's all I got.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.384
How many drinks do you have per week?

25:53.386 --> 25:58.489
Somewhere between just enough
and the perfect amount.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.224
And how long have you been smoking?

26:00.226 --> 26:01.959
Six months.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.494
Let me guess... it'll kill me?

26:05.464 --> 26:06.564
Hey.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.698
Just, uh, checking in,

26:07.700 --> 26:09.266
making sure that
you're going to be assisting

26:09.268 --> 26:11.202
on Mrs. Edison's colonoscopy.

26:11.204 --> 26:14.205
You didn't schedule me, so no.

26:14.207 --> 26:17.041
I didn't schedule you. I told you.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.342
Mm, no. No, you didn't.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.244
I want a percentage of the door

26:20.246 --> 26:21.479
if your girlfriend's gonna watch.

26:21.481 --> 26:23.013
- Uh, I'm his boss.
- She's not my girlfriend.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.149
I don't care.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.884
I'm gonna be making a new schedule, Dev,

26:26.886 --> 26:28.652
so watch out for it.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.121
You got it, Chief.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.891
Shut this hamster toy off.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.669
You know, the only good thing
about this experience

26:45.671 --> 26:47.671
has been watching you suffer more than me.

26:47.673 --> 26:50.875
That was painful.

26:50.877 --> 26:53.210
Thanks. That really helps.

26:53.212 --> 26:56.714
I'm gonna sugarcoat it for a guy
who wired me to a conveyor belt?

26:56.716 --> 26:59.483
Wilfred, the way you're living,
it's gonna kill you.

26:59.485 --> 27:00.618
You know that, right?

27:00.620 --> 27:02.486
Ah.

27:02.488 --> 27:03.654
So why do you keep doing it?

27:05.557 --> 27:08.426
Do you want to die?

27:08.428 --> 27:10.828
Not so much want to die.

27:10.830 --> 27:14.732
More like...
don't know what to live for.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.734
Well, you just live one day at a time.

27:16.736 --> 27:19.970
Oh, stop. Just stop!

27:25.278 --> 27:26.710
See here?

27:26.712 --> 27:29.079
It's invaded the tube on
this side, but not the uterus.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.581
That's the good news.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.516
It's really hemorrhaging a lot.

27:32.518 --> 27:35.152
Pressure's low. I'll push more blood.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.593
You two have a history, don't you?

27:42.595 --> 27:44.595
It's none of your business, Billy.

27:44.597 --> 27:46.030
You're careful around each other.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.031
Friends aren't like that.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.532
You're wrong. Just friends.

27:48.534 --> 27:49.800
I just think there's obviously,

27:49.802 --> 27:51.402
like, electricity in the air with you two.

27:51.404 --> 27:53.938
- It's so...
- Stop talking, please.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.073
Hold on. Do you see those lesions?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.308
Mm.

27:57.310 --> 27:59.543
They're everywhere.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.278
The cancer's spread to the omentum.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.214
Don't look.

28:03.216 --> 28:04.648
Do not make eye contact with her.

28:04.650 --> 28:05.916
This has to be my decision.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.519
What do we do?

28:08.521 --> 28:11.222
We stick to the plan.

28:11.224 --> 28:12.389
We came in to take her cancer out,

28:12.391 --> 28:13.491
and that's what we're gonna do.

28:13.493 --> 28:15.559
No, the plan was to remove the primary...

28:15.561 --> 28:17.228
I'm not leaving these spots to grow.

28:17.230 --> 28:18.329
Prep for a laparotomy.

28:18.331 --> 28:20.231
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're opening her up?

28:20.233 --> 28:22.132
Every second we're in there,
we risk the fetus.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.735
It's a small risk that we lose
patient and baby now

28:24.737 --> 28:27.438
or a good chance this kid
grows up without a mother later.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.039
I want to save them both.
We're opening her up.

28:37.782 --> 28:39.183
There are ways to manage your pain.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.585
That's what I'm asking you to do...

28:41.587 --> 28:44.488
manage it permanently.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.624
I can't do it alone.

28:46.626 --> 28:47.625
You're the doctor.

28:47.627 --> 28:49.193
No, I'm your daughter.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.295
And it's the last thing
you should ask of me.

28:53.366 --> 28:55.966
Look, when the time comes,
we can discuss this,

28:55.968 --> 28:57.568
but we're so far off from that.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.571
Don't you want to see Dougie or Jasper?

29:00.573 --> 29:03.607
Your brothers have had 10 years
to come and see me.

29:03.609 --> 29:04.642
They hate me.

29:04.644 --> 29:06.443
This is not gonna change anything.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.512
Fine, then. What about Luke?

29:08.514 --> 29:10.548
Don't do that.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.184
Mom.

29:17.122 --> 29:19.523
Mom. Mom, don't!

29:21.928 --> 29:24.295
Mom, come out and talk to me, please.

29:24.297 --> 29:28.432
I'm supposed to look after you,
not the other way around.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.571
I still need you.

29:33.573 --> 29:35.639
You never needed me.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.075
Well, I do now.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.379
I'm pregnant.

29:51.646 --> 29:55.481
You're the only person I've told.

29:55.483 --> 29:56.749
And it's Charlie's.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.417
Yeah.

30:01.422 --> 30:04.190
Go back to him.

30:04.192 --> 30:05.291
You love him.

30:05.293 --> 30:07.927
I do.

30:07.929 --> 30:10.196
It doesn't work that way.

30:10.198 --> 30:12.064
It's not enough.
It wasn't enough for you.

30:12.066 --> 30:14.133
It wasn't enough for you and Dad.

30:16.837 --> 30:18.904
You know, I used to believe

30:18.906 --> 30:20.673
that I was responsible

30:20.675 --> 30:22.708
for all the bad luck in this family.

30:22.710 --> 30:24.777
God knows we've had our share.

30:26.214 --> 30:28.948
But after your dad died,

30:28.950 --> 30:32.151
I thought that you were
gonna be the one to escape it.

30:32.153 --> 30:34.420
But I haven't, mom.

30:35.456 --> 30:37.523
Charlie and I, well,

30:37.525 --> 30:41.460
we've had nothing but terrible luck.

30:41.462 --> 30:44.230
You have an amazing career
and a beautiful son.

30:44.232 --> 30:45.531
How is that bad luck?

30:45.533 --> 30:47.032
And I can't
be with the man that I love

30:47.034 --> 30:48.133
because we're cursed.

30:48.135 --> 30:50.569
You are not cursed.

30:51.672 --> 30:53.472
We make our own destiny.

30:55.442 --> 30:58.410
God, I hope so.

31:00.214 --> 31:03.716
And I'm gonna have another grandchild.

31:03.718 --> 31:06.585
Well, it looks like it.

31:09.990 --> 31:14.293
You know, you were the only one of my babies

31:14.295 --> 31:16.495
that I didn't need a pregnancy test for.

31:16.497 --> 31:17.630
Really?

31:17.632 --> 31:19.732
Right from the beginning, I knew

31:19.734 --> 31:21.600
because you were giving me hell.

31:21.602 --> 31:23.168
Well...

31:23.170 --> 31:26.305
You had so much fight in you.

31:26.307 --> 31:27.673
You still do.

31:30.678 --> 31:32.578
I got it from somewhere.

31:34.916 --> 31:37.116
I'm dying, honey.

31:37.118 --> 31:40.252
Nothing's gonna change that.

31:40.254 --> 31:42.721
Faster, slower... what's the difference?

32:04.544 --> 32:06.412
You removed the ovary and stopped the bleed?

32:06.414 --> 32:07.546
Yes.

32:07.548 --> 32:09.615
Going after all of it...
that was a risky choice.

32:09.617 --> 32:11.317
It was the right choice.

32:11.319 --> 32:13.218
I know.

32:14.854 --> 32:16.522
My family's here.
I'll go talk them through it.

32:16.524 --> 32:17.957
Okay. I'll be right out.

32:22.896 --> 32:24.997
That still happens

32:24.999 --> 32:27.099
even when
you're a grown-up doctor?

32:27.101 --> 32:28.701
I guess it does today.

32:34.574 --> 32:36.709
Okay, now you're just messing with me.

32:36.711 --> 32:39.478
Oh, lighten up a little, buttercup.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.846
Your wife wind you up like that?

32:40.848 --> 32:43.816
Girlfriend. And no, actually.

32:45.152 --> 32:46.285
How long were you married?

32:46.287 --> 32:49.154
56 wonderful years.

32:49.156 --> 32:51.724
She was working in a flower shop
when I met her.

32:51.726 --> 32:53.192
Swept me right off my feet.

32:53.194 --> 32:54.960
That's beautiful.

32:54.962 --> 32:56.829
My girlfriend at the time didn't think so.

32:56.831 --> 32:58.230
They never do.

32:58.232 --> 32:59.798
I have Mr. Jennings' results.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.033
Well, tick-tock.

33:01.035 --> 33:03.502
I may make happy hour
at The Belladonna after all.

33:03.504 --> 33:06.772
Early stage Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy.

33:06.774 --> 33:08.374
The barrage of drugs and alcohol

33:08.376 --> 33:09.675
have caused the vessels in your heart

33:09.677 --> 33:11.343
to swell and harden.

33:11.345 --> 33:13.145
Your heart's strangling itself, Wilfred.

33:13.147 --> 33:15.280
We're gonna have to admit you, monitor you.

33:15.282 --> 33:16.348
We'll give you medication.

33:16.350 --> 33:18.717
Oh, I will take that under advisement.

33:18.719 --> 33:20.386
But, uh, for now, if you'll excuse me,

33:20.388 --> 33:22.154
I have a pitcher of mojitos waiting.

33:22.156 --> 33:25.391
Wilfred, you're an idiot.

33:25.393 --> 33:27.292
And if Priscilla were here,
she'd say the same thing.

33:27.294 --> 33:28.727
You didn't know her.

33:28.729 --> 33:30.896
She'd be okay with you
killing yourself by drinking

33:30.898 --> 33:32.164
just to prove that you loved her?

33:32.166 --> 33:35.234
What you know about love
couldn't fill a shot glass.

33:35.236 --> 33:36.869
Oh, cut the crap!

33:36.871 --> 33:39.271
What would Priscilla want?

33:39.273 --> 33:40.973
Her garden.

33:40.975 --> 33:43.208
She'd want me to look after her garden.

33:44.210 --> 33:45.310
And how's it doing now?

33:45.312 --> 33:47.112
It looks like a dog's ass.

33:47.114 --> 33:48.180
I hate gardening.

33:48.182 --> 33:49.515
And I hate salsa dancing,

33:49.517 --> 33:51.350
but you got to do what you got to do.

33:53.721 --> 33:57.089
Oh, uh... hey, Serena.

33:57.091 --> 34:00.726
So, I thought about what
you said, about the chiefship,

34:00.728 --> 34:02.194
how you think I should step down.

34:02.196 --> 34:03.629
No, I-I didn't say that.

34:03.631 --> 34:05.931
I just asked you
if you were considering it.

34:05.933 --> 34:08.801
Oh. Well, I'm not.

34:08.803 --> 34:11.402
I just got started, and I know
I can make this hospital

34:11.405 --> 34:13.005
a better place while I'm here.

34:13.007 --> 34:16.007
That's good because based
on Dawn's recommendation,

34:16.010 --> 34:18.543
I've decided to make you
permanent Chief Resident.

34:18.545 --> 34:20.646
Congratulations.

34:20.648 --> 34:22.014
Wow.

34:22.016 --> 34:23.047
That was easy.

34:23.050 --> 34:24.248
No, not easy.

34:24.251 --> 34:25.551
You just went from one
impossible job to two.

34:25.553 --> 34:27.853
Cross.

34:27.855 --> 34:28.654
Kapow.

34:29.621 --> 34:31.790
Charlie, it's happening.

34:35.161 --> 34:36.562
Dr. Harris, are you all right?

34:37.964 --> 34:39.297
Yeah. I...

34:39.300 --> 34:42.801
I just had that feeling like, uh...

34:42.803 --> 34:44.870
- someone walked on my grave.
- Ooh.

34:44.871 --> 34:47.371
Actually, that's a subconscious
release of adrenaline.

34:47.373 --> 34:48.440
Like a reaction to temperature

34:48.442 --> 34:49.775
or an emotional response to memory.

34:51.210 --> 34:53.245
You must clean up
on trivia night, Dr. O'Toole.

34:54.914 --> 34:56.782
Something's coming for me.

34:56.784 --> 34:58.717
I can feel it.

34:58.719 --> 35:00.219
Whoa. We have a problem.

35:00.221 --> 35:01.787
The craniotomy site's bleeding.

35:01.789 --> 35:03.589
Okay, his pressure must have dislodged

35:03.591 --> 35:04.690
a clot in the arterial vessel.

35:04.692 --> 35:05.824
Page Dr. Hamza.

35:05.826 --> 35:08.393
- Okay, I need sponges.
- He's tachycardic.

35:08.395 --> 35:10.662
You know, I've been ferryman for so long,

35:10.664 --> 35:12.698
showing people to the other side.

35:12.700 --> 35:13.765
It's finally my turn to take the trip.

35:13.767 --> 35:15.167
Roxy, push more fluids.

35:15.169 --> 35:16.502
Hey!

35:16.504 --> 35:19.171
Buddy, you remember you can't
handle this on your own, okay?

35:19.173 --> 35:21.140
You need a link to the living.

35:21.142 --> 35:22.474
Stay with us, Randall.

35:22.476 --> 35:23.642
Thank you for caring.

35:25.278 --> 35:26.845
It helps a lot, my friend.

35:28.282 --> 35:30.249
I'll see you on the other side, Charlie.

36:23.670 --> 36:25.070
You kept it.

36:29.877 --> 36:31.577
Anyway, I've been thinking.

36:31.579 --> 36:33.979
If...

36:33.981 --> 36:36.281
If it's what you really want...

36:39.118 --> 36:41.820
When the time comes, I will help you.

36:47.060 --> 36:48.660
Mom?

36:51.564 --> 36:52.698
Mom.

36:55.935 --> 36:58.870
Mom? Mom?

37:01.375 --> 37:02.407
Oh, my God.

37:02.409 --> 37:04.543
What... What have you done?

37:09.048 --> 37:12.818
Mother!

37:12.820 --> 37:14.519
911, what's your emergency?

37:14.521 --> 37:17.723
I have an opiate overdose at 9947 12th Line.

37:17.725 --> 37:19.524
I need an ambulance now.

37:19.526 --> 37:20.559
Come on, mama.

37:20.561 --> 37:23.629
Stay with me here!

37:23.631 --> 37:25.631
Please don't leave me.

38:18.752 --> 38:20.552
Hey, Alex. It's me.

38:20.554 --> 38:22.921
Uh, I've been wanting to talk.

38:22.923 --> 38:27.159
Something came up.
A job, actually, back home.

38:30.297 --> 38:33.565
Uh, I wanted to connect, but, uh...

38:33.567 --> 38:36.535
it seems that we can't connect.

38:36.537 --> 38:38.570
Maybe it's a sign.

38:38.572 --> 38:42.040
Uh, you know, maybe in another life,

38:42.042 --> 38:46.078
there's nothing messing us up
and nothing getting in the way

38:46.080 --> 38:49.414
of us giving this thing a chance, but, uh...

38:49.416 --> 38:51.083
doesn't look like it's this one.

38:53.187 --> 38:55.120
Listen, I-I really hope that you find

38:55.122 --> 38:57.289
whatever makes you happy, and, uh...

38:58.759 --> 39:00.225
Good luck with everything.

39:01.595 --> 39:05.831
Goodbye, Alex Reid.

39:42.835 --> 39:45.571
We'll resume chemo
as soon as she's strong enough,

39:45.573 --> 39:47.372
but right now, I want her to focus on rest

39:47.374 --> 39:49.207
and getting her strength up.

39:49.209 --> 39:50.542
Okay.

39:52.312 --> 39:53.378
Thank you.

39:53.380 --> 39:54.513
Yeah.

39:57.818 --> 40:01.453
Well, I should go.

40:01.455 --> 40:03.555
Really?

40:03.557 --> 40:05.023
After everything that's happened today,

40:05.025 --> 40:06.692
your family just doesn't want you here?

40:06.694 --> 40:09.728
You know what, they'll come
around or they wont,

40:09.730 --> 40:13.131
but I'm done trying
to make it easy for them.

40:13.133 --> 40:17.469
You seem so... different.

40:18.671 --> 40:20.405
I am.

40:20.407 --> 40:24.509
Israel was... a lot of things.

40:27.413 --> 40:28.680
Are you here for long?

40:28.682 --> 40:31.383
Do you want to get together,
have dinner, or... ?

40:34.621 --> 40:37.422
Hey, there's something I need to tell you.

40:37.424 --> 40:40.826
I thought it could wait, but... it can't,

40:40.828 --> 40:43.829
so, uh, just listen.

40:43.831 --> 40:45.897
Okay.

40:45.899 --> 40:48.200
Um...

40:50.104 --> 40:53.505
When I was in Israel,

40:53.507 --> 40:56.642
I thought about you every day.

40:58.945 --> 41:01.380
I thought about you, too.

41:08.956 --> 41:12.658
I want to find out if we can be something.

41:14.394 --> 41:16.895
I just need to know if you do, too.

42:00.773 --> 42:02.641
Is she here?

42:08.614 --> 42:09.981
Yeah.

42:15.054 --> 42:17.422
Will you tell her that I love her?

42:24.864 --> 42:26.531
She knows, Alex.

42:36.542 --> 42:38.543
She knows.
