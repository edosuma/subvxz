to stall for time.

09:25.741 --> 09:27.812
- How did you find out
Marco was having an affair?

09:27.845 --> 09:29.248
- Love letters.

09:29.281 --> 09:31.753
Actual, old-fashioned
human mail

09:31.787 --> 09:35.828
found through actual,
old-fashioned bedroom snooping.

09:35.861 --> 09:39.334
Annie the Otter
is someone named Lisa Holly.

09:39.368 --> 09:41.973
- Our interior decorator's
social media strategist?

09:42.007 --> 09:43.242
- Hold on, wait a minute,

09:43.276 --> 09:45.380
why was Marco stealing
from his own wife?

09:45.413 --> 09:48.219
- Because he's broke!
The trust fund is in my name.

09:48.252 --> 09:49.789
- Trust fund?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.760
I thought you made
all your money

09:51.793 --> 09:53.764
from consulting
and entreprenursing.

09:53.797 --> 09:56.368
- No, it's my
great-grandaddy's money.

09:56.402 --> 10:00.143
Mostly from tobacco,
a little from asbestos.

10:00.176 --> 10:01.913
- Okay, let me
get this straight.

10:01.947 --> 10:05.353
While we were all playing fair,
digging these infernal rocks,

10:05.386 --> 10:06.857
you two were cheating the game

10:06.890 --> 10:09.629
by buying your way
into a golden parsnip

10:09.662 --> 10:11.967
using money you inherited
from cancer?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.706
- That's how wealth works.
- [laughs]

10:14.739 --> 10:17.845
Oh, man,
what a crazy adventure.

10:17.879 --> 10:19.682
This is the part
where we all laugh, right?

10:19.716 --> 10:22.087
Maybe a freeze frame? Watch.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.728
Guys, freeze.

10:27.397 --> 10:28.901
- I never freeze.

10:28.934 --> 10:31.405
- Mr. Tagliano,
I need a divorce attorney.

10:31.438 --> 10:33.744
- Oh, right, different mood.

10:36.148 --> 10:37.919
- You what sucks, man?

10:37.952 --> 10:40.356
I thought Marco and I were
gonna wind up like brunch bros,

10:40.390 --> 10:43.262
united by the meritocracy
of the free market.

10:43.296 --> 10:44.899
And it turns out he was just,

10:44.933 --> 10:47.137
like, a rich, spoiled,
cheating asshole.

10:47.170 --> 10:48.841
I mean, what are
the odds of that?

10:48.874 --> 10:50.711
- Well, David, you did
some pretty good wheeling

10:50.744 --> 10:52.748
and dealing to get
that hang glider.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.420
I mean, Dr. Marjorie Frost
would be proud, probably.

10:55.453 --> 10:58.259
- That's true, I did rock
that hang glider exchange.

10:58.292 --> 11:00.764
Uh, why are you still
playing that, though?

11:00.798 --> 11:02.969
- Miriam gave it to me.
Didn't want it.

11:03.002 --> 11:03.904
- Are you having fun?

11:03.937 --> 11:05.139
- Um.

11:05.173 --> 11:06.208
No.
