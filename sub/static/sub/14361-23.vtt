(Crow caws)

00:08.057 --> 00:09.028
(Frankie) Brick, what are you
doing in there?

00:09.136 --> 00:10.273
Get what you want
and shut the door.

00:10.362 --> 00:12.116
But I've got my middle school
placement test tomorrow.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.774
Mr. Walker said everyone has
to bring a healthy snack.

00:14.895 --> 00:17.142
Well... (Sighs) yeah.

00:17.252 --> 00:20.156
Here you go.
Jelly. Jelly's a fruit.

00:20.235 --> 00:21.596
Can't get much healthier
than that.

00:21.681 --> 00:24.032
- We're out of bread.
- Even better. You eat it with a spoon,

00:24.131 --> 00:25.944
and the vitamins get
to your brain faster.

00:26.266 --> 00:27.506
(Sighs) Fine.

00:27.586 --> 00:28.256
Look at this.

00:28.356 --> 00:30.486
We just got a pink cutoff
notice from the power company.

00:30.579 --> 00:33.424
What? No, they can't do that.
We're only at green.

00:33.519 --> 00:35.424
It goes green then yellow
then pink.

00:35.524 --> 00:38.064
Hey, we're good,
non-paying-on-time customers.

00:38.164 --> 00:39.490
They can't do that to us.
(Sniffs)

00:39.580 --> 00:41.101
You're right.
We hold all the cards.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.829
(Sighs) Somebody's gotta go down
there tomorrow and pay the bill.

00:43.926 --> 00:45.625
Mm, I guess <i>somebody</i> does.

00:45.718 --> 00:47.717
Well, I can't.
Axl's off school tomorrow,

00:47.807 --> 00:50.133
so I'm taking him fishing,
remember? Borrowing Ed's boat.

00:50.198 --> 00:52.120
Okay.
Olives are a vegetable.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.598
Two, if you count the little
thing in the middle.

00:53.661 --> 00:55.168
Now close the fridge.
You heard your dad.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.517
They're gonna shut off
our power.

00:59.558 --> 01:00.619
What are you doing?

01:00.714 --> 01:02.812
You know, I've never really
looked at your room before.

01:02.976 --> 01:04.965
When you feel your
nerd powers being drained,

01:05.036 --> 01:06.408
do you come in here
to recharge?

01:06.500 --> 01:08.317
(Scoffs) Get out of here, Axl.

01:08.403 --> 01:10.671
Oh, I'm going. (Clears throat)
And you know why?

01:10.741 --> 01:12.498
Because a journey
of a thousand miles

01:12.586 --> 01:14.483
begins with a single step.

01:14.567 --> 01:15.802
<i>Hilarious.</i>

01:15.902 --> 01:17.452
Maybe I'll take a journey
to the kitchen

01:17.552 --> 01:19.522
and tell mom you were
in my room!

01:19.611 --> 01:20.974
Jeez, hang in there, baby.

01:21.096 --> 01:22.533
Don't sweat the small stuff.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.059
Would you just get out?!

01:24.163 --> 01:26.294
I don't go into your room
and stare at your booger wall.

01:26.389 --> 01:27.958
Hey! Some of those
aren't mine.

01:29.627 --> 01:34.088
Whoa! Wait a sec.
How many of these

01:34.187 --> 01:35.949
perfect attendance certificates
do you have?

01:36.042 --> 01:37.932
Have you seriously never
missed a day of school?

01:38.028 --> 01:39.402
Why would I not go to school?

01:39.501 --> 01:43.049
Axl, the most powerful weapon
in the world is education.

01:46.095 --> 01:47.821
Hmm. (Pops lips)

01:47.925 --> 01:49.851
So you've really never
skipped school?

01:49.969 --> 01:51.858
Never? Not... once?

01:51.972 --> 01:54.227
No. What if I missed
something important?

01:54.332 --> 01:57.520
Wow. I am seriously worried
about you, Sue.

01:57.623 --> 01:59.527
That is not normal.
I mean, you think...

01:59.868 --> 02:02.940
This guy would have ever made it
to the top of that mountain

02:03.051 --> 02:04.500
if he just sat at his desk
every day

02:04.608 --> 02:06.538
winning perfect attendance
certificates?

02:06.639 --> 02:08.335
Methinks he would not.

02:08.645 --> 02:12.037
<i>(Frankie) Axl's "methinks"</i>
<i>made Sue start to think.</i>

02:13.052 --> 02:14.220
<i>Was it true?</i>

02:14.344 --> 02:16.142
<i>Did she never leave</i>
<i>her comfort zone?</i>

02:16.264 --> 02:17.692
<i>Was she afraid to fly?</i>

02:17.819 --> 02:19.937
<i>Her posters,</i>
<i>once so inspirational,</i>

02:20.050 --> 02:22.111
<i>now seemed to be mocking her.</i>

02:22.302 --> 02:23.667
<i>Much as she hated to admit it,</i>

02:23.768 --> 02:26.010
<i>she was not following</i>
<i>the advice of her own walls.</i>

02:26.173 --> 02:28.141
_

02:32.443 --> 02:34.771
Bye, dad. I guess mom
already took Brick,

02:34.873 --> 02:36.130
so I'm gonna go out
and catch the bus.

02:36.231 --> 02:38.771
'Cause it'll be here soon...
to take me to school.

02:38.872 --> 02:40.221
- Mm-hmm. (Chuckles)
- Okay.

02:40.378 --> 02:41.877
Have fun fishing, you guys.

02:42.015 --> 02:44.228
I want to hear all about it...
(Zips bag)

02:44.321 --> 02:46.649
after I come home tonight
from a full day of school,

02:46.766 --> 02:47.945
which I am about to leave for.

02:48.038 --> 02:50.073
- Oh, my God, just go.
- Yeah.

02:53.463 --> 02:54.553
<i>She was doing it.</i>

02:54.650 --> 02:56.306
<i>She was pecking out</i>
<i>of that shell.</i>

02:56.506 --> 02:58.312
<i>Yep, at the ripe old age of 16,</i>

02:58.444 --> 03:00.850
<i>sue heck was gonna skip school.</i>

03:01.931 --> 03:03.703
(Indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

03:03.816 --> 03:05.628
Ugh! Are you serious?

03:05.729 --> 03:08.438
Only one person working?
Oh, this is ridiculous.

03:08.796 --> 03:10.448
I know, right?
(Groans)

03:10.543 --> 03:11.986
I really cannot be late.

03:12.304 --> 03:15.578
You know, my job's not nearly
as important as yours.

03:15.669 --> 03:18.152
You go ahead, doctor.

03:19.189 --> 03:20.834
Well, thank you.
(Chuckles)

03:21.487 --> 03:23.614
- Thank you so much.
- Mm-hmm.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.244
(Cooler thuds)

03:40.836 --> 03:44.687
Remember to fill in
your circles completely.

03:44.802 --> 03:48.475
Not an "X," not a scribble,

03:48.831 --> 03:50.193
not a...

03:50.829 --> 03:52.770
Brick, what are you doing?

03:52.922 --> 03:54.973
This test is very important.

03:55.074 --> 03:56.495
It determines
what track you'll be on

03:56.631 --> 03:58.524
in middle school.

03:58.810 --> 03:59.770
Oh, that's okay.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.731
I've decided I'm not going
to middle school.

04:04.261 --> 04:06.493
(Sighs and groans)
(Telephone ringing)

04:08.160 --> 04:09.892
Of all the days to be
stuck here.

04:09.996 --> 04:11.813
And I have so many patients.

04:11.911 --> 04:14.242
I hear ya.
I've got appointments, too.

04:14.326 --> 04:16.791
Yeah. Well, if it was
just me, it would be fine.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.925
I just worry about the kids.

04:19.137 --> 04:21.733
But I guess they can wait.
(Sighs)

04:21.833 --> 04:24.518
Except, of course,
Little Jimmy.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.912
Uh, you know what?
Uh, why don't you go ahead?

04:28.013 --> 04:29.407
- Oh, really? Oh...
- Yeah.

04:29.535 --> 04:30.788
Thank you.

04:30.972 --> 04:33.488
You saved a life today.

04:34.887 --> 04:36.179
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

04:36.291 --> 04:38.486
<i>Was this really</i>
<i>how the other half lives?</i>

04:38.621 --> 04:40.566
<i>This coat was power.</i>

04:42.071 --> 04:43.402
(Taps on glass)

04:47.188 --> 04:48.723
(Telephone rings)

04:50.685 --> 04:52.814
(Ring)

04:54.383 --> 04:56.709
(Ring)

04:58.160 --> 05:00.501
(Ring)

05:01.032 --> 05:04.743
<i>Sue's ditch day wasn't exactly fun yet.
</i> (Grunts)

05:04.885 --> 05:06.454
<i>But she knew as soon as she</i>
<i>intercepted the call</i>

05:06.555 --> 05:09.863
<i>from the attendance office, she could
really start living.</i> (Ringing continues)

05:09.964 --> 05:12.515
(Gasps) <i>Provided she stayed low
to the ground and out of sight.</i>

05:12.607 --> 05:13.468
(Beeps) Hello?

05:13.579 --> 05:15.335
(Woman) This is the Orson High
attendance office.

05:15.452 --> 05:17.323
May I speak to Frankie Heck,
please?

05:17.458 --> 05:19.238
(Imitates British accent)
Yes, this is she!

05:19.444 --> 05:21.280
(Whispers) Why am I British?

05:21.389 --> 05:24.924
I'm just verifying that
Sue Heck is home sick today.

05:25.035 --> 05:27.470
Oh, yes. She is quite sick.

05:27.582 --> 05:29.661
Sick as the Dickens,
I'm afraid.

05:29.798 --> 05:31.766
Well, please make sure
she brings a note

05:31.863 --> 05:33.821
with a parent signature.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.106
- A note?
- Yes.

05:36.216 --> 05:39.153
It's a requirement anytime
a student has been absent.

05:39.217 --> 05:41.616
Very well. A note.

05:41.710 --> 05:43.379
I'll add it to my <i>shed-ule.</i>

05:43.491 --> 05:44.910
Cheerio!
(Beeps)

05:44.985 --> 05:46.206
(Gasps)

05:47.394 --> 05:50.259
(Lowered voice) I don't know
what the issue is.

05:50.374 --> 05:53.513
Now he's saying he doesn't want
to go to middle school at all.

05:53.669 --> 05:55.953
Should we call the parents?

05:56.204 --> 05:58.881
(Lowered voice) Sure.
Let's call the parents.

05:58.972 --> 06:00.896
I mean, what do we even need
a school therapist for?

06:00.983 --> 06:03.157
I mean, what do they need
any of us for, for that matter?

06:03.308 --> 06:04.589
Is that what you're trying
to do, Mark?

06:04.747 --> 06:05.951
Put us out of a job?

06:06.051 --> 06:07.362
You don't like insurance?

06:07.459 --> 06:09.410
68 days off every summer?

06:09.564 --> 06:11.310
We have a sweet gig here.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.607
We need to look out
for each other.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.397
Well, prep the patient,

06:21.509 --> 06:23.052
and I'll be there
as soon as I can.

06:23.172 --> 06:25.683
Is the heart in yet
from Seattle Grace?

06:26.268 --> 06:27.186
(Mouths words)

06:27.860 --> 06:29.887
Yes, I know I'm the doctor
you come to

06:30.023 --> 06:31.315
when no one else can do it,

06:31.379 --> 06:33.374
but I'm stuck in line
at the power company.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.846
Listen to me.
We're not gonna lose this kid.

06:36.003 --> 06:37.954
I want you to run a CT, a CBC,

06:38.071 --> 06:39.644
a chem-7, and a tox screen.

06:39.795 --> 06:42.284
<i>Thank you, "Grey's Anatomy."</i>

06:43.826 --> 06:46.695
You know, Axl, this is nice.
I'm glad we're doing this.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.357
You'll be heading off
to college soon.

06:48.463 --> 06:51.416
Yep. Closing the book
on 12 years of learning.

06:51.507 --> 06:53.112
So glad that's done.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.574
Yeah. Well,

06:54.663 --> 06:57.045
you might not want to close
that book completely just yet.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.157
- College is--
- Whoa!

06:58.271 --> 07:00.103
Hey! What are you
talking about school for?

07:00.211 --> 07:01.429
You're gonna ruin the trip.

07:01.582 --> 07:02.993
I'm just saying,
you didn't exactly

07:03.109 --> 07:05.432
light up the world
with your report cards.

07:05.540 --> 07:06.416
College is a lot of work,

07:06.524 --> 07:08.297
and I'm not gonna be there
to kick your butt every day.

07:08.403 --> 07:09.635
Dad, I haven't even
graduated yet,

07:09.723 --> 07:11.269
and you're already
putting pressure on me.

07:11.372 --> 07:12.655
Look, you're not gonna
be able to skate by

07:12.748 --> 07:14.110
like you did in high school.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.865
It'll catch up to you there.

07:15.976 --> 07:17.178
You gotta keep your eye on the ball.
(Sighs)

07:17.265 --> 07:19.418
There's gonna be all kinds
of distractions.

07:19.555 --> 07:23.389
(Girls giggling)
<i>(Tropical music playing)</i>

07:23.474 --> 07:25.250
Important to stay focused.

07:25.453 --> 07:28.294
(Tires screech, thud,
clattering)

07:28.814 --> 07:30.100
(Brakes screech)

07:33.939 --> 07:36.038
(Boat crashes)

07:43.140 --> 07:44.619
All right.

07:45.947 --> 07:47.241
All right.

07:48.088 --> 07:49.267
All right. (Sighs)

07:49.393 --> 07:52.004
I'm sorry. Wh-what was that
again you were telling me about,

07:52.093 --> 07:53.968
uh, you know,
not getting distracted?

07:54.075 --> 07:56.232
- All right.
(Laughs) - 'Cause that was hilarious.

07:56.342 --> 07:58.084
I mean, you were totally
checking out those girls.

07:58.188 --> 08:00.063
Hey, it was a large group.
All right?

08:00.161 --> 08:01.652
You look at a large group
of anything--

08:01.753 --> 08:04.505
gazelles, ants, RVs.

08:04.604 --> 08:06.182
So, uh, what are you
gonna tell mom?

08:06.284 --> 08:08.158
'Cause, uh, I'm allowed
to look at girls,

08:08.257 --> 08:09.668
but I'm pretty sure you're not.

08:09.768 --> 08:11.268
Hey, your mom spends
an awful lot of time

08:11.370 --> 08:12.856
Googling Brian Williams.

08:12.972 --> 08:15.087
Yeah. Wouldn't go
with that one. (Laughs)

08:16.790 --> 08:20.001
Hey, Brick, you know, I just
thought we could chat. Huh?

08:20.110 --> 08:23.419
So... what's up?
What's the haps?

08:23.517 --> 08:27.301
<i>Que pasa,</i> as they say
in some lands, hmm?

08:27.401 --> 08:28.578
How are things at home?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.655
Anyone on drugs?

08:30.840 --> 08:32.885
Well, our power's gonna be
turned off,

08:33.004 --> 08:35.259
and my parents
are sending my brother away.

08:35.443 --> 08:38.390
Also, I had secret agent
kittens in my closet.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.315
Oh.

08:41.389 --> 08:44.553
Th-- uh... does anyone else see
these kittens? (Clicks pen)

08:44.663 --> 08:47.371
Oh, no. They're gone now,
'cause they got famous.

08:47.712 --> 08:48.910
Oh...

08:50.609 --> 08:51.824
(Gasps)

08:51.913 --> 08:54.689
How much do you think they're
gonna look at the signature?

08:54.792 --> 08:57.047
'Cause my mom's handwriting
has this weird "K"

08:57.161 --> 08:58.748
that I just can't seem
to get down.

08:58.835 --> 09:01.284
I don't think they look
at the signature <i>that</i> closely.

09:02.357 --> 09:04.202
So what's happening?

09:04.286 --> 09:06.749
Is the whole school, like,
freaking out that I'm not there?

09:06.949 --> 09:09.594
Um... I don't think so.

09:09.705 --> 09:11.345
How 'bout you and your bad self?

09:11.460 --> 09:14.471
OMG, are you having, like,
<i>so much fun?</i>

09:14.750 --> 09:17.040
<i>So</i> much fun.

09:17.154 --> 09:19.624
I don't know how much more
fun I can take.

09:20.622 --> 09:22.038
So what time is it?

09:22.136 --> 09:23.679
You guys almost done
for the day?

09:24.086 --> 09:25.641
Sue, it's 10:15.

09:25.757 --> 09:27.175
What!?

09:27.473 --> 09:28.613
(Sighs)

09:30.303 --> 09:31.438
(Sighs)

09:31.900 --> 09:33.177
So, listen.
Usually I get

09:33.290 --> 09:35.651
two notices and <i>then</i> a pink one,
but this time--

09:35.723 --> 09:37.884
Oh, I'm so sorry, doctor.

09:38.002 --> 09:39.583
There must be some error
on our part.

09:39.678 --> 09:41.156
Let me check my computer.

09:41.740 --> 09:42.641
(Typing)

09:42.734 --> 09:44.795
I see they've added
some late charges,

09:44.899 --> 09:46.542
but of course I'll waive those.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.384
Oh. Excellent. (Chuckles)

09:48.494 --> 09:51.820
And somehow they've dropped
the "doctor" from your account.

09:51.911 --> 09:53.518
I'll just add that back in.

09:53.657 --> 09:56.057
Well, thank you, Sandra.
I appreciate it.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.878
I mean, sure, it's just a title.
A few little letters.

09:58.992 --> 10:01.889
But they do represent
so much training and expertise.

10:02.052 --> 10:05.147
Now, can you put half
on my Discover Card

10:05.273 --> 10:07.579
and half on my Kroger Card?
(Sets card on counter)

10:09.478 --> 10:10.811
(High-pitched voice)
Hi, Brick.

10:10.926 --> 10:12.388
I'm Curious Cat.

10:12.516 --> 10:14.521
Please ignore the fact that
I'm anatomically correct,

10:14.624 --> 10:17.076
as that has no bearing
on this discussion.

10:17.217 --> 10:23.081
So, tell me, what's going on
in the wonderful world of Brick?

10:24.459 --> 10:25.446
Really?

10:25.546 --> 10:27.064
We're actually doing this?

10:27.205 --> 10:28.465
(Sighs)

10:28.951 --> 10:29.937
(Normal voice)
Sorry, Curious Cat.

10:30.065 --> 10:32.048
I guess Brick isn't
in the mood to chat.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.755
Like that time Shelly
broke up with me

10:33.877 --> 10:35.015
and I begged her
to talk it out,

10:35.102 --> 10:36.685
and she just slammed
the door in my face.

10:36.788 --> 10:38.467
(As Curious Cat)
She didn't deserve you.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.412
(Normal voice)
Thank you, Curious Cat.

10:40.578 --> 10:41.759
You get me.

10:41.936 --> 10:44.193
Seems like you guys
have a lot to talk about.

10:44.407 --> 10:46.189
Should I just leave
you two alone?

10:47.464 --> 10:49.458
(Phones ringing)

10:49.580 --> 10:51.998
Frankie. Thank goodness
you're here.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.534
We have a new patient
coming in,

10:53.631 --> 10:55.072
the phone is ringing,
and I didn't know

10:55.138 --> 10:57.334
what the "Hello, how are ya?" to do.
(Ringing stops)

10:57.439 --> 10:58.531
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

10:58.652 --> 11:00.063
I-I know it's just
my fifth day of work

11:00.200 --> 11:01.387
and you don't know me
that well,

11:01.484 --> 11:04.027
but this is not who I am.
I am not the late person.

11:04.134 --> 11:06.813
It's just, if the person
I hired to answer the phone

11:06.927 --> 11:09.299
isn't here to answer
the phone, then...

11:09.396 --> 11:10.605
ring, ring. "Who's there?"
"I don't know.

11:10.749 --> 11:11.921
No one's here
to answer the phone."

11:12.031 --> 11:13.411
I know. I am so, so sorry.

11:13.571 --> 11:15.457
I don't mean to be mean,

11:15.591 --> 11:17.190
but you should probably be here

11:17.316 --> 11:19.717
when you're supposed
to be here, you know?

11:19.862 --> 11:21.180
Whew.

11:21.273 --> 11:23.340
Sorry things got heated there.

11:23.437 --> 11:25.949
Dr. Grouchy hasn't made
an appearance in a while,

11:26.093 --> 11:28.899
but just, please, Frankie,
<i>pretty please,</i>

11:28.974 --> 11:30.536
be on time.

11:30.746 --> 11:32.388
Ugh! There he is again.

11:34.493 --> 11:36.473
(Sighs) (Doorbell rings)

11:36.553 --> 11:38.030
Hi, wel-- (Gasps)

11:38.128 --> 11:40.160
Hey!

11:40.328 --> 11:42.328
From the line, right?

11:42.447 --> 11:43.968
(Nervously) <i>Hi!</i>

11:44.060 --> 11:47.301
Huh. I'm sorry. I assumed
you were a doctor.

11:47.401 --> 11:49.623
You said something about
saving lives?

11:49.712 --> 11:50.849
Well, tooth decay is

11:50.919 --> 11:52.731
the number-one killer
of children.

11:52.822 --> 11:54.180
Well, maybe not number one,

11:54.284 --> 11:56.049
but it's definitely
in the top three.

11:56.254 --> 11:58.544
(Gasps)
Okay. I'm ready back here.

11:58.625 --> 12:01.130
Oops! Hang on. We seem to be
missing a patient.

12:01.211 --> 12:03.359
Sure hope we find one soon.

12:05.315 --> 12:06.436
Okay.

12:06.538 --> 12:08.749
Why don't you go on back
with my assistant,

12:08.867 --> 12:10.528
and we can get started?

12:13.229 --> 12:15.530
<i>Don't judge.</i>
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

12:15.657 --> 12:18.672
<i>I couldn't have my new boss</i>
<i>thinking I was crazy.</i>

12:25.117 --> 12:27.580
Oh, I got one. _
(Horn blares)

12:27.915 --> 12:29.211
Oh... got away.

12:29.334 --> 12:30.634
That was a big one, too.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.861
Axl, stop screwing around
and get over here and help.

12:32.959 --> 12:33.822
Why are you yelling at me?

12:33.930 --> 12:35.093
I'm not the one who put
the boat in the ditch

12:35.187 --> 12:36.722
'cause I was looking
at what I can't buy.

12:36.815 --> 12:39.195
- Will you stop?
- Why? It's true.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.539
Plus I told you
a really awesome idea

12:41.643 --> 12:43.543
to get us out of here,
but you won't try it.

12:43.631 --> 12:46.297
Okay, fine, smart guy. Let's try your way.
(Tool thuds)

12:46.388 --> 12:48.199
- Really?
- Hey, I didn't say I liked your idea.

12:48.307 --> 12:49.400
I just said I'd try it.

12:49.504 --> 12:51.075
Well, maybe if I put
a bikini on my idea,

12:51.191 --> 12:53.688
- you'd like it.
- That's your last time.

12:55.493 --> 12:57.846
(Mouths words) Okay, let's
see what we've got here.

12:57.971 --> 12:59.278
(Snaps glove) (Sighs)

12:59.384 --> 13:00.631
(Chair wheels roll)

13:02.216 --> 13:03.470
(Chairs thud)

13:04.407 --> 13:07.033
Oh, Brad, I really
don't feel well.

13:07.132 --> 13:09.287
I need you to search
hives for me.

13:09.376 --> 13:11.125
I can't do it, 'cause it'll
leave a trail on the computer,

13:11.230 --> 13:13.643
and if my parents check
the history and see "hives,"

13:13.747 --> 13:15.836
- they'll know I ditched.
(Sighs) - Sorry, Sue.

13:15.937 --> 13:17.260
I gotta get back
to the assembly.

13:17.424 --> 13:19.829
- Wait, wait. What assembly?
- Uh, only

13:19.952 --> 13:21.700
the surprise assembly.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.815
Everyone in school
got out of Math and English

13:23.946 --> 13:25.002
to go to the gym to watch

13:25.120 --> 13:28.058
four college a cappella groups
having a sing-off.

13:28.172 --> 13:29.924
I totally think
the Testostitones

13:30.023 --> 13:31.112
are gonna take it.

13:31.229 --> 13:32.880
Also, reporters are here,
and Carly and I

13:33.009 --> 13:34.815
got interviewed
for the 6:00 news.

13:34.953 --> 13:36.142
I gotta get back in there, Sue.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.702
They're handing out free ice cream!
(Line clicks)

13:41.986 --> 13:42.938
(Groans)

13:43.284 --> 13:45.661
(Playing chords)
♪ what's on your mind? ♪

13:45.810 --> 13:48.259
♪ how you doing today? ♪

13:48.443 --> 13:49.472
♪ have you-- ♪

13:52.111 --> 13:54.290
That's it.
Really get in there.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.166
Explorer.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.687
That's right.
This is an explorer.

14:01.537 --> 14:04.810
Oh. Okay. The more, the merrier, I guess.
(Chuckles)

14:05.299 --> 14:06.295
(Scraping) Let's see.

14:06.395 --> 14:08.424
There's some decay
on the mesial buccal surface

14:08.514 --> 14:09.916
of number two...

14:10.004 --> 14:12.893
Bingo. That's right.
That's a hard one to find.

14:15.636 --> 14:18.231
(Grunts) Let's go, old man.
Keep rocking it!

14:18.307 --> 14:19.997
Come on!
Put your back into it!

14:20.137 --> 14:22.318
I'm gonna put my boot
into something in a second.

14:22.409 --> 14:24.177
Hey, relax, all right?

14:24.264 --> 14:26.364
This is only phase one
of the plan.

14:26.496 --> 14:28.580
(Grunts) What's phase two?

14:28.750 --> 14:31.352
(Revving)

14:32.417 --> 14:33.507
Whoa!

14:33.879 --> 14:35.481
Oh! Yes!

14:35.595 --> 14:36.909
Ha ha ha!

14:36.999 --> 14:38.552
Look whose plan worked!
(Laughs)

14:38.658 --> 14:41.559
Guess you don't need a shovel
when you got an Ax, huh?

14:55.199 --> 14:55.894
(Sighs)

14:56.054 --> 14:57.280
<i>Sue wanted to salvage</i>
<i>what was left</i>

14:57.382 --> 14:59.601
<i>of her day of fun,</i>
<i>so she crawled to the one place</i>

14:59.706 --> 15:02.157
<i>she could stay out of sight and relax.
</i> (Turns on TV)

15:02.954 --> 15:05.233
<i>(Woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>on TV)</i>

15:05.403 --> 15:06.803
<i>(Woman) It's gorgeous, honey.</i>
<i>Where'd you get that?</i>

15:06.891 --> 15:09.677
<i>(Woman) Can you believe it? Now</i>
<i>I have a contact, and they...</i>

15:11.037 --> 15:12.951
(Can fizzes)
(Gasping) Uhh! Ahh!

15:13.013 --> 15:14.820
No... (Gasping and panting)

15:15.700 --> 15:16.828
(Gasps loudly)

15:17.982 --> 15:19.291
(Continues gasping)

15:19.378 --> 15:20.441
(Gasping)
I'm desperate here, Brad.

15:20.530 --> 15:21.974
I need you to search stains.

15:22.075 --> 15:23.948
What gets out pop and salsa--

15:24.078 --> 15:24.887
(Mouth full) Hang on.

15:24.986 --> 15:26.992
I got a mouthful
of pralines and cream.

15:27.086 --> 15:29.743
Brad! My mom's
gonna be home soon!

15:29.855 --> 15:32.779
Ugh! This is
the worst day ever.

15:32.916 --> 15:36.080
(Starts machine) Why did I think I
needed to break out of my comfort zone?

15:36.227 --> 15:39.367
I love school.
I love my egg!

15:39.447 --> 15:41.371
This is all Axl's fault.

15:41.498 --> 15:43.426
You know, he twisted
the meanings of my posters

15:43.519 --> 15:44.777
all around.

15:44.881 --> 15:47.862
People can still climb mountains
without skipping school.

15:47.975 --> 15:50.454
They just do it
outside of school hours.

15:50.559 --> 15:52.244
(Machine whirring loudly
and rumbling)

15:52.508 --> 15:54.245
(Machine stops)

15:54.342 --> 15:56.021
No!

15:56.553 --> 15:58.443
(Yells indistinctly) (Rattles)

15:59.913 --> 16:01.167
A-all right, Brick.

16:01.274 --> 16:02.722
I give up.

16:04.139 --> 16:05.965
If the Tribe of Truth
doesn't work,

16:06.082 --> 16:08.035
I don't know what will.

16:08.662 --> 16:11.332
I've done everything
a professional therapist can do

16:11.431 --> 16:13.381
to justify his job.

16:13.551 --> 16:14.975
I just don't get it.

16:15.295 --> 16:17.706
Why don't you want to go
to middle school?

16:17.832 --> 16:19.944
Oh. Was that what this
was all about?

16:20.109 --> 16:21.913
Well, at the middle school,

16:22.020 --> 16:24.328
the handles on the water
fountains are on the right,

16:24.427 --> 16:26.310
and I'm used to having them
be on the left

16:26.402 --> 16:27.800
like they are here.

16:28.006 --> 16:29.779
It's kind of a big change,

16:29.904 --> 16:31.894
and I don't think
I'm ready for it.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.449
That's what you're
worried about?

16:33.570 --> 16:35.239
Water fountains?

16:35.423 --> 16:36.872
Brick, half the water fountains
at the middle school

16:36.982 --> 16:39.470
don't even work.
The place is a dump.

16:39.572 --> 16:40.693
I mean, if you're gonna
worry about anything,

16:40.769 --> 16:42.510
- it should be the asbestos.
- What?

16:42.621 --> 16:45.024
Nothing-- no. No, no, no.
It's fine.

16:45.146 --> 16:46.427
It's nothing worry about.
It--

16:46.524 --> 16:48.474
you know, it's a silent killer.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.845
I guess I'd feel better
about middle school

16:50.942 --> 16:52.428
if I was going with my friend.

16:52.530 --> 16:54.176
Oh. Well, who's your friend?

16:54.340 --> 16:55.803
You.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.017
Oh... (Exhales)

16:58.101 --> 16:59.720
Wow, Brick.

16:59.947 --> 17:01.015
(Exhales)

17:01.592 --> 17:04.038
Oh, God, I-I wish Shelly
could hear this.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.630
(Chuckles) Don't tell me
I don't connect to kids.

17:06.711 --> 17:08.884
Maybe it's just 'cause your kids
are a couple of hell-raisers.

17:08.984 --> 17:11.577
- Uh, what's that?
- Nothing. Nothing, Brick.

17:11.685 --> 17:13.244
But I have some good news.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.801
Yeah, due to the crushing
defeat of the latest bond issue,

17:15.930 --> 17:18.259
I now have to do the work
of three people.

17:18.372 --> 17:23.118
So... I am at the middle school
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.634
You are? So we can
keep hanging out?

17:25.723 --> 17:27.267
You got it, buddy.

17:27.424 --> 17:28.339
And you'll...

17:28.424 --> 17:30.595
Yes, I'll talk to them
about the water fountains.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.026
Great.

17:32.413 --> 17:35.211
- So let's take that test.
- All right!

17:35.434 --> 17:37.588
- So we filled the mesial occlusal...
- So we filled the mesial occlusal...

17:37.693 --> 17:39.427
- on number 31.
- on number 31.

17:39.553 --> 17:42.050
- Uh, your tongue is gonna be numb...
- Your tongue is gonna be numb

17:42.188 --> 17:44.668
- for a little while...
- So just be careful about what you eat.

17:44.763 --> 17:45.821
So just be careful about
what you eat.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.247
- Frankie, could I see you
outside for a minute? - Sure.

17:51.369 --> 17:52.978
(Sighs)

17:53.143 --> 17:54.708
What is going on with you?

17:54.836 --> 17:56.886
All day long you've been
acting like a--

17:56.985 --> 17:58.662
pardon my French--
a weirdo.

17:58.758 --> 18:01.303
I mean, I love the repeating
game more than anybody,

18:01.383 --> 18:04.147
but I just don't think
it's appropriate for work.

18:04.246 --> 18:06.321
(Sighs) Okay, look.

18:06.449 --> 18:07.964
The truth is...

18:08.774 --> 18:10.795
I think this guy
is stalking me.

18:10.881 --> 18:14.077
I saw him at the power company
this morning, and now he's here.

18:14.197 --> 18:16.133
I had no idea.
(Breathes sharply)

18:16.297 --> 18:19.244
Thank you for your honesty.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.664
Boy, I remember how nervous
I was telling my dad,

18:21.794 --> 18:24.599
"Dad, I hate dentistry!
I want to be a fireman!"

18:24.731 --> 18:26.568
But then I didn't pass
the fireman test

18:26.671 --> 18:29.055
'cause I had a bad eye.
This one's glass.

18:29.131 --> 18:30.828
It's not.
But I wish it was,

18:30.931 --> 18:33.014
then I wouldn't
have to be a dentist.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.544
(Inhales sharply) Hey.

18:35.752 --> 18:38.501
Maybe I should just
"drop him" from the practice

18:38.609 --> 18:40.466
so you don't have to
see him again.

18:41.301 --> 18:42.783
(Clicks tongue) You know,
I think that would be best.

18:42.890 --> 18:45.008
We don't need that kind
of crazy around here.

18:46.432 --> 18:48.475
<i>Well, it's true what they say.</i>

18:48.568 --> 18:51.962
<i>He who lies once finds it</i>
<i>much easier to lie again.</i>

18:52.060 --> 18:53.577
<i>I read that on a poster</i>
<i>somewhere--</i>

18:53.673 --> 18:55.124
<i>probably in Sue's room.</i>

18:55.207 --> 18:56.611
<i>You know, I'm starting</i>
<i>to understand</i>

18:56.708 --> 18:59.044
<i>how Lance Armstrong</i>
<i>got in so deep.</i>

19:01.776 --> 19:03.158
What?

19:03.611 --> 19:04.688
Nothing.

19:04.799 --> 19:06.911
Um... (Laughs) it's just, uh,

19:07.078 --> 19:09.662
you're checking out girls, you're
crashing boats. (Chuckles)

19:09.765 --> 19:11.893
- This is a whole new you.
- Yeah.

19:11.993 --> 19:14.304
Well, don't get used to it.

19:14.583 --> 19:15.757
Nah, it's cool.

19:15.975 --> 19:17.855
I've never really seen you
mess up before.

19:18.121 --> 19:21.138
Really? I guess you
haven't been watching.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.782
You know, that, uh,
motor thing--

19:26.875 --> 19:28.225
that was a good idea.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.025
I never would have
thought of that.

19:31.482 --> 19:33.721
You might do okay
in college after all.

19:38.179 --> 19:39.857
(Muffled rumbling) Come on...

19:40.032 --> 19:41.219
Come on!

19:42.813 --> 19:44.614
(Brakes squeal)

19:45.535 --> 19:46.663
(Head thuds)

19:46.819 --> 19:48.287
(Gasping) (Machine buzzes)

19:53.484 --> 19:54.396
(Mailbox door squeaks)

20:18.692 --> 20:22.790
(Bottles rattle)
(Exhales deeply)

20:28.802 --> 20:30.755
Hey, mom.
School was great.

20:30.883 --> 20:32.410
There was an a cappella
group sing-off.

20:32.523 --> 20:33.603
And ice cream!

20:33.725 --> 20:35.039
I'll be in my room.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.214
<i>It's funny.</i>

20:39.311 --> 20:40.573
<i>You think you know</i>
<i>what your family does</i>

20:40.663 --> 20:42.303
<i>when they walk out the door</i>
<i>every morning,</i>

20:42.446 --> 20:44.044
<i>but you know what?</i>

20:44.138 --> 20:45.772
<i>You don't always know</i>
<i>everything.</i>

20:45.980 --> 20:47.445
(Mouth full) So how was
everybody's day?

20:47.555 --> 20:49.488
The test was good.
Nothing special.

20:49.575 --> 20:51.673
- Normal day.
(Mouth full) - Fishing was good.

20:51.812 --> 20:53.432
(Mouth full) Yep.
How was work?

20:53.552 --> 20:55.104
You know. Work's work.

20:55.201 --> 20:59.220
<i>Yep. These were gonna be</i>
<i>great stories-- someday.</i>

20:59.313 --> 21:00.437
<i>But not today.</i>
