00:01.436 --> 00:02.872
Previously
onCrazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.915 --> 00:04.526
Wait, whose baby is that?It's my baby.

00:04.569 --> 00:05.570
The one you helped me make.

00:05.614 --> 00:07.007
I was just walking
by with Hebby,

00:07.050 --> 00:08.660
and I thought maybe Rebecca
might want to see her,

00:08.704 --> 00:09.922
since she's
never acknowledged

00:09.966 --> 00:11.185
her genetic offspring.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.882
HEATHER: So, do you have to, like, study

00:12.925 --> 00:14.753
everywhere we go?I have a final.

00:14.797 --> 00:15.885
I'm gonna be a lawyer.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.234
A lawyer, Scott.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.235
Well, you have worked so hard.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.236
You're almost there, babe.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.195
Why is hehere?

00:21.238 --> 00:22.544
She gets like this.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.763
You ruin a shot again,
and I will put you in ICU.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.852
Bitch, don't get in my way,
bitch.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.637
I got to go see my dad.
He's sober now.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.117
Going to meetings,
just like me.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.901
REBECCA: There's something
I got to tell you.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.337
I had sex with your dad.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.078
I can't believe that happened.
Why did you do that?

00:35.122 --> 00:36.297
What are you guys doing here?

00:36.340 --> 00:37.689
I wanted to talk to you.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.474
About what? Guys! Guys!

00:39.517 --> 00:40.475
VALENCIA:
All of your exes showed up

00:40.518 --> 00:41.476
on your doorstep?

00:41.519 --> 00:43.086
Are they still into you?

00:43.130 --> 00:44.087
I don't know.Mm.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.915

Welcome to Rebetzel's.
Please try a sample.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.097
Yeah. Take it.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.490
Sample?

01:39.534 --> 01:41.492
Yeah. It's terrible.
Just...

01:41.536 --> 01:43.538
Take one, AJ.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.541
No.

01:46.584 --> 01:49.587
No. What is
this disgusting flavor?

01:49.631 --> 01:51.720
I call it the Hot Mess.
What?

01:51.763 --> 01:53.156
This epitomizes
how I feel right now,

01:53.200 --> 01:54.375
which is confusion

01:54.418 --> 01:56.377
over no matter how hard
I try in my life,

01:56.420 --> 01:59.293
it always ends up
a steaming hot mess.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.294
Right.

02:00.337 --> 02:01.512
Yeah.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.254
Oh, I love a sample.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.864
Food claw coming on in.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.742
Oh, that is--
that is terrible.

02:13.785 --> 02:14.917
Ugh.
Exactly. It's supposed
to taste bad.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.397
It's bad, like my life.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.963
Why? Is everything okay?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.878
Did you hear about what happened
on my porch the other night?

02:19.922 --> 02:21.880
Oh, you mean when Nathaniel and
Greg came over to your house

02:21.924 --> 02:23.273
and there was also
the other guy there

02:23.317 --> 02:25.406
and then Josh came flying
out in those man panties

02:25.449 --> 02:26.885
and he had that tennis racket?

02:28.017 --> 02:29.584
Mm-mm, I hadn't heard.

02:29.627 --> 02:30.628
So everyone knows.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.891
Great. Wonderful.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.895
Darryl, I'm so confused.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.810
I mean, Nathaniel
and Greg clearly had

02:38.854 --> 02:40.899
something super important
they wanted to tell me,

02:40.943 --> 02:42.292
but I never found out
what it was.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.902
And I keep texting both of them,

02:43.946 --> 02:45.730
and it's radio silence.

02:46.775 --> 02:47.863
What were they doing there?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.212
Ooh. Oh.

02:49.256 --> 02:52.433
Hebecca's waking up from
her little nappy nap.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.043
Who?

02:54.086 --> 02:55.827
Oh, my God.
You're not serious.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.829
Oh! Hebecca.
That's the name of your baby.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.657
Your baby. That's your baby.
Right, right, right.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.137
Okay, okay, what is the deal?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.052
Why do you always space on
the fact that I have a baby,

03:03.095 --> 03:04.967
one that you gave me an egg for,

03:05.010 --> 03:06.882
one whose name
rhymes with yours?

03:06.925 --> 03:08.927
I mean, it's kind of like
you got a thing about her.

03:08.971 --> 03:11.234
I don't have a thing about her.
You have a thing about her.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.889
Yeah. You're weird
around her.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.152
It's like you can
barely even look at her,

03:16.196 --> 03:18.981
because she reminds you of a
very traumatic time in your life

03:19.024 --> 03:20.287
where you made
some rash decisions

03:20.330 --> 03:22.289
and contributed to the existence
of another person

03:22.332 --> 03:23.942
and maybe didn't
fully think it through.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.205
What?

03:25.248 --> 03:28.077
I-I don't look at her
like that at all.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.254
Okay. Well, I don't know
how you look at her,

03:31.298 --> 03:32.864
because I'm just not
a baby person.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.475
Everyone is a baby person.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.259
All you need to do
is sniff her head.

03:36.303 --> 03:39.567
I'm telling you, baby
sniffs are my CBD oil.

03:39.610 --> 03:42.091
I go to a store, they don't
have my favorite feta?

03:42.134 --> 03:44.485
Sniff the head. Bad day at
the office? Sniff the head.

03:44.528 --> 03:47.139
Brother has cancer?
Sniff that head.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.141
Um, your brother has cancer?

03:49.185 --> 03:50.447
Not anymore.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.712
Hmm.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.540
She is kind of cute.

03:56.584 --> 03:59.064
Cute? She's the most
wonderful baby in the world.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.979
And I'd love for you to
spend more time with her.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.285
Maybe you could even

04:02.329 --> 04:04.983
babysit someday.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.376
Uh...

04:06.420 --> 04:07.812
Yeah, I don't know.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.858
Maybe. Maybe someday.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.425
How's about Saturday at 6:45?

04:11.468 --> 04:12.861
Sorry, what?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.036
I really need someone.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.038
My mom group set
me up on a date.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.693
And my nanny,
Evelyn, she's busy.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.434
I-I don't know
about babysitting. I've just--

04:20.477 --> 04:23.524
I-I don't have much experience
with, like, a crying baby.

04:23.567 --> 04:24.873
Oh, she doesn't cry at all.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.875
It's actually weird
how little Hebby cries.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.355
Right?

04:28.398 --> 04:30.052
Oh, come on.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.227
It isn't that hard
to take care of a baby.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.968
Lots of people do it just fine.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.709
Snooki has a baby.

04:34.752 --> 04:35.927
She has two babies.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.189
And look at what a
great job she's doing

04:37.233 --> 04:38.930
with Lorenzo and Giovanna.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.499
Okay.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.893
I'll do it. Okay.

04:44.936 --> 04:45.894
Yay!

04:45.937 --> 04:47.374
Hooray!

04:47.417 --> 04:50.290
Yay, Auntie Rebecca.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.031
Yay! Look!

04:53.075 --> 04:54.381
She loves you!

04:54.424 --> 04:55.817
I see it.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.042
Whew! Good job, Tony.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.870
You woke up in that skate park
with a belly full

05:05.914 --> 05:08.351
of Oxy and booze, but you
bounced back and you're here.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.049
Who else wants to share?

05:11.093 --> 05:13.443
I'm on my seventh cup of coffee,
and I can't stop talking

05:13.487 --> 05:14.792
unless somebody else gets up.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.055
I'll go.I'll go.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.101
Uh...

05:20.189 --> 05:22.060
I came here today because, uh,

05:22.104 --> 05:24.280
I-I did a terrible thing
to my son.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.934
Oh, no, Dad,
what are you doing?

05:25.977 --> 05:27.370
I want to repair
our relationship.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.068
What I did to you, sleeping
with your ex-girlfriend,

05:30.112 --> 05:31.809
that was--
that was--

05:31.853 --> 05:33.245
it was unforgivable.

05:33.289 --> 05:36.205
It was my rock bottom,
and I'm-I'm ashamed.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.468
Oh, my God. We already talked
about this privately.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.991
You also talked
about this publicly,

05:40.035 --> 05:42.080
because we talked about this
last week at our meeting.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.082
Yeah, but I really want him
to know how sorry I am.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.041
I-I-I can't say it
enough.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.129
I know you're sorry.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.391
And so does everyone here

05:48.435 --> 05:50.393
and everyone from last week
who isn't here.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.177
So,

05:52.221 --> 05:53.570
please, just...

05:53.614 --> 05:57.095
You don't have
to apologize anymore, okay?

05:58.793 --> 06:00.969
Another cup of coffee?

06:01.012 --> 06:03.058
I could hear your large
intestine screaming.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.146
Let me have this.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.409
I don't have meth
anymore.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.803
Hey, are you actually dealing
with what happened

06:08.846 --> 06:12.154
with your feelings
with the daddy-girlfriend sex?

06:12.197 --> 06:13.851
Oh, wow, that is
an awful term.

06:13.895 --> 06:16.463
I mean, have you even talked
to Rebecca since she told you?

06:16.506 --> 06:18.160
You showed up on that patio
with something to say,

06:18.203 --> 06:19.466
and you didn't even say it.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.163
Greg, if you got

06:21.206 --> 06:22.643
something to say to Rebecca,

06:22.686 --> 06:24.209
you got to say it.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.956
And have a truly happy day.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.957
Thank you.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.003
Hi, babe.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.004
Hi, Mama Cookie.

06:36.047 --> 06:38.049
Here is your invite

06:38.093 --> 06:40.443
to a game night on Saturday.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.314
A game night?

06:43.490 --> 06:45.187
Oh, shoot. I just told Darryl

06:45.230 --> 06:47.232
that I'd babysit
Hebecca on Saturday.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.233
Whoa, really?

06:48.277 --> 06:49.452
Oh, that's great!

06:49.496 --> 06:51.323
I mean, it was
a bit unsettling,

06:51.367 --> 06:54.457
the way you kept forgetting that
your genetic daughter existed.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.850
Yeah, but, you know what,
no, I can cancel,

06:55.893 --> 06:57.242
because you never have parties.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.809
I mean, God, for your
birthday, we just went

06:58.853 --> 07:01.029
grocery shopping and ate premade
sushi in the parking lot.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.291
Okay, first of all,

07:02.334 --> 07:04.119
this is not an actual party.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.555
It's a game night.

07:05.599 --> 07:09.124
Second, that is how I wanted
to celebrate my birthday--

07:09.167 --> 07:12.127
with you and some room-temp
California rolls.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.084
It was perfect.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.217
No one stared at me

07:15.260 --> 07:17.219
and no one sang
"Happy Birthday,"

07:17.262 --> 07:19.308
so it was a big win.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.527
Okay, seriously, Paula,

07:20.570 --> 07:22.093
I can just cancel on Darryl.
It's fine.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.008
No! No way.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.010
You're bonding with Hebecca.
That's huge.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.098
Do that.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.187
I do need an even number,
though.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.189
Who else can I ask
at the last minute?

07:31.233 --> 07:32.756
I mean, Darryl's got
a date, obviously.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.498
And Sunil has another
widowers' camping retreat.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.326
Those are definitely orgies.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.503
And, uh-- oh, Mrs. H
is the worst at games.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.113
Have you seen her play charades?

07:42.157 --> 07:43.201
She just waves her arms around.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.334
So, you know,
unless her clue is

07:45.377 --> 07:46.814
"used car lot balloon guy,"

07:46.857 --> 07:48.772
it's just-- it's a disaster.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.557
You know who lovesgames?Who?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.907
Your new best friend Josh Chan.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.169
Huh.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.518
Oh, since our trip
to San Bernardino,

07:55.562 --> 07:57.128
I like that guy.Mm.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.956
Plus, I need a couch moved,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.132
and the water cooler's
been empty for weeks.

08:01.176 --> 08:02.351
Good call.

08:02.394 --> 08:06.007
All right, well,
good luck babysitting, Mama.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.791
You're gonna be great.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.976
Oh, uh, hey, after you.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.892
No, no, after you,
Mr. Man Panties.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.111
Excuse me?

08:23.154 --> 08:24.547
Yeah, no.
That ridiculous underwear

08:24.591 --> 08:26.288
you were wearing on the patio
the other night.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.898
The panties.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.509
I was in my own house,

08:29.552 --> 08:31.467
and they are notpanties.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.296
Oh.They are very expensive
Fett by Fett Regoso

08:34.339 --> 08:36.211
high-performance,
moisture-wicking briefs,

08:36.254 --> 08:37.952
cut high for gluteal mobility.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.257
Mm.Yeah.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.563
I post a picture of myself
in them every day

08:40.607 --> 08:42.739
to attract the attention
of Fett Regoso Inc.,

08:42.783 --> 08:45.263
who are looking
for online brand spokesmen.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.264
Wow.

08:46.308 --> 08:48.353
Wow with you. Wow.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.530
Okay, trust me, I don't like
you any more than you like me.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.357
So, wow yourself.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.663
You know what, Josh,

08:53.707 --> 08:54.708
I actually don't dislike you.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.840
We are just
wildly different people.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.102
You are on a different planet.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.539
We have absolutely nothing
in common.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.452
What, you don't wear underwear?

09:00.496 --> 09:02.324
Dude, that's really dangerous.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.673
Like, what about zippers?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.111
Oh, cool.What?

09:07.155 --> 09:09.679
Did a bot like one
of your panty pictures?

09:09.723 --> 09:13.509
No. I got invited
to a party at Paula's house.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.293
No.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.034
I'm going to that party, too.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.384
Great. Fun.

09:19.428 --> 09:20.995
All right, look, since
we're both going to the party

09:21.038 --> 09:23.519
and especially since Rebecca
will probably be there,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.391
why don't we just agree to give
each other a wide berth, hmm?

09:26.435 --> 09:27.392
Fine. Done.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.394
Deal.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.396
"Berth."

09:37.446 --> 09:39.491
DARRYL:
Okay, so, basically,

09:39.535 --> 09:41.406
you got the easiest
type of babysitting:

09:41.450 --> 09:42.799
sleep-time babysitting.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.584
She's been fed
and changed

09:44.627 --> 09:46.368
and she's asleep
in her crib.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.631
Great. Great.
This is gonna be easy.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.632
I'm not worried.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.286
Also, just in case,

09:51.329 --> 09:53.288
I printed out an article
from Quimblepop.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.420
"37 Things that Calm a Baby."

09:55.464 --> 09:57.422
Oh, you're not gonna need
that. She will not wake up.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.423
Never does.It'll be fine.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.555
Listen, just-just
get out of here.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.556
I got this.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.862
Thanks.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.038
I'm excited about it.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.605
She's a pharmacist.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.650
You know what they say...

10:07.694 --> 10:09.260
Oh, I don't know what they say.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.392
Oh. I was hoping you did.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.176
I don't know what to
talk about with her.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.439
All right. Well,

10:14.483 --> 10:15.615
wish me luck.Okay.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.660
Bye.Bye.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.271
Ah.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.535
Okay. You're a baby.

10:31.152 --> 10:34.634
Yes! 90210marathon.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.288
Just what I needed--
a break from the drama.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.334
Except for the drama
in Beverly Hills,

10:39.377 --> 10:41.336
which I am all about.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.861
What?

10:49.344 --> 10:51.346
Uh...

10:56.351 --> 10:58.527
Oh, my God.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.009
Uh...

11:07.928 --> 11:09.364
Oh, my God.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.149
No. No, no, no, no, no.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.890
Baby, baby, shh, shh.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.587
Quiet sounds, no sounds.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.330
No. Please, baby.
Please, please, please.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.332
A boy is coming over. Please?

11:25.380 --> 11:27.338
Okay.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.166
Okay.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.745
Hi. You had something
you wanted to say?

11:51.798 --> 11:54.714
PAULA:
Oh. This is gonna be
a great game night.

11:54.757 --> 11:57.194
Well, except Rebecca's
not gonna be here.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.674
I bet if you told her

11:58.718 --> 12:00.415
this game night was your law
school graduation party...

12:00.458 --> 12:02.852
Uh-uh-uh-uh, shh, Scott,
we're not talking about that.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.506
Okay, and don't say that
to anyone.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.682
I don't want to hear the word
"graduation" from you.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.728
I don't understand why
you're being like this.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.513
Why didn't you invite
everyone to the ceremony?

12:11.556 --> 12:14.690
It was just me and Tommy,
so we lost the unspoken

12:14.734 --> 12:17.649
but very real cheering
section competition.
Aw.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.260
We stood no chance
against the family

12:19.303 --> 12:21.218
with the air horns
and the confetti guns.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.307
You have to tell people
what the party's for.

12:23.351 --> 12:26.267
I don't want attention,
I don't want fuss.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.225
I just want a fun game night.

12:29.357 --> 12:32.273
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.188
So happy
you could all make it.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.668
You're all a part of my life
in different ways.

12:36.712 --> 12:37.931
Husband, boss,

12:37.974 --> 12:40.847
girl group, partner,
girl group, spouse,

12:40.890 --> 12:42.544
and... Josh.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.502
HEATHER:
So exciting

12:44.546 --> 12:47.027
to see your living room, Paula,
I never been in here before.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.377
Where's Bunch?

12:49.420 --> 12:50.944
She's coming to this
tonight, right?

12:50.987 --> 12:53.076
I mean, she's part of
your whole girl mob thing.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.818
I mean, not that I care.
I don't care, obviously.Rebecca is

12:55.862 --> 12:57.167
not coming.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.516
Um, she's babysitting
for Darryl. So,

12:58.560 --> 13:00.823
let me tell you
about the game

13:00.867 --> 13:02.303
we're going to play.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.175
I made it up myself,
and it's called...

13:05.219 --> 13:07.656
Trial by Fire.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.834
Ha, ha! Interesting name, Paula.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.706
What is this game,
and how is it played?

13:14.750 --> 13:16.839
Well, Scott, I'm
so glad you asked.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.885
It's a combination

13:18.928 --> 13:21.888
of Celebrity and charades,
and the twist is...

13:21.931 --> 13:24.151
all the famous people

13:24.194 --> 13:26.849
are people from
famous trials.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.374
Huh.Hmm.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.376
That sounds so... great,

13:32.420 --> 13:34.030
but if you're open
about games,

13:34.074 --> 13:36.337
I do love
traditional charades.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.425
Or Mafia is fun.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.426
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.819
Water polo.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.257
Not an option?
It is a game.

13:43.300 --> 13:46.695
Yes. No. Thanks, everyone,
for those wonderful suggestions,

13:46.738 --> 13:47.827
but, you know,

13:47.870 --> 13:49.002
tonight,
for no particular reason,

13:49.045 --> 13:50.873
I would like
to play a law-themed game.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.179
I think you'll really like it.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.658
So, now,

13:53.702 --> 13:57.880
everybody, pick a number
out of the hat.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.664
Huh. So we're
gonna pick a number,

13:59.708 --> 14:01.231
and then square
off and compete

14:01.275 --> 14:03.016
against each other
in your living room,

14:03.059 --> 14:05.148
and that's what middle-class
people do, and that's cool?

14:05.192 --> 14:07.020
Yeah, it's a game night, dude.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.718
Oh, this is exciting.
I love competing,

14:09.761 --> 14:12.112
and, you know, I really like
winning, so...

14:12.155 --> 14:13.591
I'm gonna win this.
I'm gonna win!

14:14.723 --> 14:16.899
Team One! Who's got it?

14:16.943 --> 14:18.945
Uh, me.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.860
Oh. Uh... Huh.
You know, actually,

14:20.903 --> 14:22.905
I think,
now that I'm looking at it,

14:22.949 --> 14:25.081
it looked more
like a "seven" or an "L."

14:25.125 --> 14:27.518
You know, I'm not that excited,
either. You're mean.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.956
I'm not mean, okay?
I'm nice now!

14:32.219 --> 14:34.003
Baby, are you a "three"?

14:34.047 --> 14:35.309
Uh, no, I'm "four."

14:35.352 --> 14:38.094
Me, too.Cool. Yes.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.487
Team Two!

14:39.530 --> 14:41.141
Oh! Yay! Me, too!

14:41.184 --> 14:42.838
Ha, ha!

14:42.882 --> 14:46.711
So that means, the other
person who is "three" is...

14:46.755 --> 14:49.540
Yup. It's me.

14:49.584 --> 14:50.933
Huh.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.371
They have a history.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.938
I don't exactly
know what happened,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.809
but Valencia is always
really mean to Hector.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.899
Oh, I know. Trust me.
I've heard all about it.

14:59.942 --> 15:03.293
Okay, everyone, let's play!

15:08.124 --> 15:11.040
Don't worry. This is gonna stop
soon, because Darryl said

15:11.084 --> 15:12.563
she barely cries,
so she'll stop crying soon,

15:12.607 --> 15:14.478
and then you can finally tell me
what you want to tell me.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.828
You want me to try?No. No, no, no.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.961
I don't know what you could do
that I'm possibly not doing,

15:19.005 --> 15:20.832
'cause, you know, if anyone
should be able to soothe her,

15:20.876 --> 15:23.705
it's me, 'cause we're related,
so...

15:23.748 --> 15:25.489
You know what? I'm
just gonna... Shh...

15:25.533 --> 15:27.013
What?

15:29.232 --> 15:31.147
What?

15:31.191 --> 15:33.454
What just happened?
How did you do that?

15:33.497 --> 15:34.890
I don't know. I just...

15:34.934 --> 15:36.065
Can I try?Yeah.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.153
Let me try.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.415
Shh...

15:38.459 --> 15:39.721
Oh!

15:39.764 --> 15:42.028
Okay. Okay.
All right. All right.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.420
Okay, okay.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.640
What the...? I can't
soothe her at all,

15:45.683 --> 15:47.990
and you just did it
like... that.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.906
Yeah, so, listen, Rebecca,
I wanted to tell you...

15:50.950 --> 15:52.952
You know, I'll just, I'll
stay in this position.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.257
What I wanted to tell you...

15:54.301 --> 15:56.433
Hey, I really want
to hear what you have to say,

15:56.477 --> 15:58.435
but just a quick,
tiny question.

15:58.479 --> 16:01.917
What do I do about the fact
that this baby hates me?

16:08.576 --> 16:10.882
Okay, so, round one.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.710
Scott and I will go first.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.016
You ready, babe?

16:14.060 --> 16:15.800
Oh, you bet.
Honey, let's do this!Okay, go.

16:15.844 --> 16:18.064
PAULA:
Um, uh...

16:18.107 --> 16:19.674
Heathers,shoplifting.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.981
Uh, Winona Ryder!Yes! Okay.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.635
Uh, um... duel, britches.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.594
Aaron Burr!
Yes.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.204
Uh, oh, his dad shot him.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.597
Marvin Gaye.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.077
Right.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.817
Uh... oh, she
axed her parents.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.080
Lizzie Borden.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.995
PAULA:
Yes.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.300
Uh, evolution trial!

16:37.344 --> 16:38.867
John T. Scopes!
Yes!

16:38.910 --> 16:39.911
Time!

16:39.955 --> 16:40.869
Oh!

16:42.131 --> 16:43.828
SCOTT :
Oh! Oh,

16:43.872 --> 16:46.309
I learned so much about the law
from your flash cards, honey.

16:46.353 --> 16:50.922
Mm.It's almost like
I'm the one who grad... ually...

16:50.966 --> 16:53.403
learned about the legal system
through flash cards.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.971
Well, wait. Um, what
happened to Marvin Gaye?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.668
Oh, his dad murdered
him. Anyway...

16:57.712 --> 16:58.930
As an adult?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.368
No, Josh, as a baby.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.413
Marvin Gaye was murdered
as a baby.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.416
All the music that he made that
you love, he made as a baby.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.591
Whoa.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.203
Fun!

17:10.246 --> 17:13.423
Fun talking! Um... okay,
Valencia and Hector.

17:13.467 --> 17:14.859
Your turn.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.035
Uh...

17:16.948 --> 17:19.125
Uh, okay, uh, just,
uh, as a reminder,

17:19.168 --> 17:23.564
uh, in this game, everyone has
to be nice to everyone else.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.087
Is that correct?

17:25.131 --> 17:26.567
That's-that's one of the rules,
right?

17:26.610 --> 17:28.090
Of course we'll be nice
to each other.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.657
I've always been nice
to you, Hector.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.615
We go way back.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.923
Si arruinas esto, te mataré y arrojaré tu cuerpo a un río.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.142
Okay?

17:36.185 --> 17:38.666
Oh, you guys are
bonding in Spanish!

17:38.709 --> 17:40.102
So great!

17:40.146 --> 17:41.321
Oh!Okay, well, come on up!

17:41.364 --> 17:42.539
Yup.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.498
Huh. I dropped
out of Spanish,

17:44.541 --> 17:46.543
but I definitely heard
the word "kill."

17:46.587 --> 17:48.850
Also, "river,"
so not great.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.113
Maybe-- kill, river--
they're planning a fishing trip.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.593
Maybe.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.122
Okay.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.993
I don't know this one.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.995
Mm.
Pass.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.563
Pass. Pass.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.479
Pass.
Pass.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.917
Pass. Pass.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.095
Pass. Pass.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.096
Pass.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.662
Pass.

18:18.706 --> 18:21.100
Pass. Pass. Pass.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.103
And time.
Yes! Done!

18:24.146 --> 18:25.930
Perfect. Nicely done, Hector.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.063
Strong work.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.021
Stop. She does that
with her eyebrow

18:30.065 --> 18:32.372
when she's about
to assassinate me.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.069
And yet you're still alive.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.428
Okay.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.343
She's finally asleep.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.171
We did it.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.477
What? No. Youdid it.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.522
I didn't do anything.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.742
She hates me.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.745
Yeah, this is it.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.616
This is why
I've been avoiding this baby.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.183
It's 'cause I knew
that she would hate me.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.750
Well...I knew that she would know

19:02.793 --> 19:05.274
that I am dangerous
and destructive.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.102
Rebecca...
Greg.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.365
Darryl says she never cries,
and she's around me

19:09.409 --> 19:12.063
for two seconds, and she turns
into The Exorcist?

19:12.107 --> 19:13.543
No. The best thing for her

19:13.587 --> 19:16.198
is for me to just stay as far
away from her as possible.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.026
I mean, I've-I've done
enough damage

19:18.069 --> 19:21.072
bringing her into this world
and giving her my garbage genes.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.162
I just... I just need
to stay far away from her,

19:23.205 --> 19:24.859
because, also,
I bring out the worst in her,

19:24.902 --> 19:26.861
because I bring out the worst
in everybody, even babies.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.689
Come on, stop.I mean, you know it's true.

19:28.732 --> 19:32.214
You left West Covina
just to get away from me,

19:32.258 --> 19:33.955
and look how well you're doing.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.348
So, clearly,

19:35.391 --> 19:37.045
everyone is better off
without me, just face it.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.829
Rebecca, stop.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.222
If everyone was
better off without you,

19:40.266 --> 19:41.702
then why did I come
here to tell you

19:41.745 --> 19:43.660
that I can't stop thinking
about you, and I miss you,

19:43.704 --> 19:46.141
and I clearly still
have feelings for you?

19:46.185 --> 19:49.100
Wait. I think something
slipped out there.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.319
Did something slip out?

19:52.539 --> 19:55.150
You still have feelings for me?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.804
Oh, yeah, that's
what slipped out.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.240
You, um...

19:59.285 --> 20:01.243
I'm sorry. What?

20:01.287 --> 20:03.898
Look, the thing is, I realized
how I felt about you,

20:03.941 --> 20:06.248
came over to tell you, and
all those guys were there,

20:06.292 --> 20:09.077
and that was not enjoyable,
but I don't care.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.949
I can't stop
thinking about you.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.389
What do you think?

20:16.432 --> 20:21.045
I think that I feel...
the exact same way.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.103
We should really get the baby
out of this room.

20:35.146 --> 20:37.279
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We should do that. Yeah.Yeah.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.112
Okay, and...

20:44.155 --> 20:45.679
Everyone is still having fun.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.463
Uh...

20:47.507 --> 20:49.291
Josh... and Nathaniel,

20:49.335 --> 20:51.293
come on, show 'em
how it's done.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.774
All right, buddy,
come on, let's crush it!

20:53.817 --> 20:55.428
Come on!Okay.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.215
Okay, uh, okay,
this is, um, three names.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.218
Uh, first one is a, uh, creature

21:03.262 --> 21:04.828
in an animated movie
about a cat,

21:04.872 --> 21:07.875
and last name is...
another movie, uh, not animated,

21:07.918 --> 21:10.530
uh, about a guy who's

21:10.573 --> 21:14.229
super smart and...
speaks in an accent.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.018
Uh... what?

21:21.062 --> 21:22.890
Well, it says
"Oliver Wendell Holmes."

21:22.933 --> 21:24.674
That's a Supreme Court justice.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.154
No one knows that.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.677
No one knows who plays
a creature in an animated movie.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.027
Yeah, they do.
It's called Oliver & Company,

21:30.071 --> 21:31.681
so... Oliver.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.248
NATHANIEL: Okay,
let's just keep... just...

21:33.292 --> 21:34.467
And time.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.425
How many did we get?How many did we...?

21:36.469 --> 21:38.384
Zero. We got zero.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.038
We need a strategy.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.736
We're getting creamed out there.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.521
Yeah, I know.
But it's just a dumb game night.

21:45.565 --> 21:46.653
It's not a big deal, all right?

21:46.696 --> 21:48.002
Not a big deal?

21:48.045 --> 21:49.351
It's a competition.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.484
All right?
It's something
that we can win.

21:51.527 --> 21:52.659
It's a symbol of our strength.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.313
We need to be a team.I don't know

21:54.356 --> 21:56.358
if I want to be
on the same team as you.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.577
We don't even like each other.

21:57.620 --> 21:58.578
Like I said, you're mean.

21:58.621 --> 21:59.753
Not anymore!

21:59.796 --> 22:03.104
Look... look, who
cares about "like"?

22:03.147 --> 22:04.540
We're teammates.
You think I liked

22:04.584 --> 22:07.500
all the testosterone jerks
on my water polo team?

22:07.543 --> 22:09.371
Of course-- they're my
brothers and I love them.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.243
But did I always like them? No.
But we had to work together

22:12.287 --> 22:13.810
to get the little
ball into the net.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.464
Right, I-I hear that.

22:15.508 --> 22:18.206
I mean, I don't like
all the guys at my dojo,

22:18.249 --> 22:20.469
but I have to trust them
because they hold the wood

22:20.513 --> 22:22.210
for board-breaking.Wait a minute.

22:22.253 --> 22:23.298
That's it.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.691
Sports.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.606
You're an athlete,
I'm an athlete.

22:26.649 --> 22:27.868
That's what we
have in common.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.391
Wow, we actually have
something in common.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.436
Look, you and I

22:30.479 --> 22:31.654
are very different,

22:31.698 --> 22:34.353
but, really, we speak
the same language.

25:10.813 --> 25:11.771
Please?

25:17.254 --> 25:19.126
Yes.

25:23.565 --> 25:24.740
Okay.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.873
Baby's moved.

25:26.916 --> 25:29.963
Should we un-pause? Press play?

25:32.095 --> 25:33.836
I was really enjoying
the kissing

25:33.880 --> 25:35.751
from a few minutes ago, but...

25:35.795 --> 25:37.797
Yeah, something
feels... weird.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.755
Um...

25:40.800 --> 25:42.105
So, listen.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.194
You know me--
I'm usually the first person

25:44.238 --> 25:47.763
to impulsively throw myself
into any really romantic moment,

25:47.807 --> 25:49.678
but I think
I got to just...

25:49.722 --> 25:51.593
take a beat
and deal with the fact

25:51.637 --> 25:54.117
that right before you
so sweetly kissed me, I was...

25:54.161 --> 25:55.945
in the middle of a shame spiral.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.947
Which isn't
just a me thing.

25:57.991 --> 26:01.081
That's a thing that happens
with my disorder, BPD.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.518
Um, and basically,
it's what you saw.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.608
I can spiral out
about things, in this case...

26:06.652 --> 26:08.610
oh, my fear
that everyone hates me

26:08.654 --> 26:10.960
and that I'm a contagious plague
in the form of a woman,

26:11.004 --> 26:12.962
even though intellectually
I know that I'm not.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.660
Yeah.

26:14.703 --> 26:17.967
Hey, I'm sorry if I bombarded
you in that moment.

26:18.011 --> 26:19.621
No, it's totally fine,
and I loved it.

26:19.665 --> 26:22.319
I just, I need to make sure that
I'm not relying on your feelings

26:22.363 --> 26:23.669
for my own sense of self-worth.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.671
Right, and I totally hear that.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.716
And you are very wise.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.895
Oh...

26:32.939 --> 26:36.333
So can we kiss again, or not?

26:37.944 --> 26:39.510
Yes.

26:39.554 --> 26:40.903
Un-pause.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.688
We can resume kissing.

26:42.731 --> 26:43.950
Great.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.172
I'm so glad we un-paused.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.609
Me, too.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.309
Ow, ow, ow. There's
something under me.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.702
Oh, okay.

26:56.745 --> 26:57.964
Ooh!

26:58.007 --> 26:59.792
What...?

26:59.835 --> 27:02.011
Oh, there's a toy
halfway up my ass.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.289
This is all a big mess.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.988
Where did Josh
and Nathaniel even go?

27:22.031 --> 27:24.773
We don't know, but...
would you mind if we left?

27:24.817 --> 27:27.036
Hector is very triggered.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.604
No!Wha...

27:29.648 --> 27:31.737
Uh, come on, you guys,

27:31.780 --> 27:33.434
we just got started.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.044
I mean, you can't leave.

27:35.088 --> 27:37.743
No one leave. Please.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.135
Everything's going wrong.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.181
Rebecca couldn't come,
everyone sucks at the game

27:41.224 --> 27:44.619
or is ignoring the game or
fighting or all of these things.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.926
Honey, maybe we should play
a different game.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.318
Or-or no games.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.886
A-And maybe we should tell
people why they're here.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.367
No. No way!

27:53.410 --> 27:55.935
I don't want to tell
people that I graduated

27:55.978 --> 27:57.545
and that's what
this party is.

27:57.588 --> 28:01.505
That kind of attention makes
me feel so uncomfortable

28:01.549 --> 28:03.943
and awkward and anxious

28:03.986 --> 28:07.424
and-and pressured to be
something or say something.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.995
This is my own private victory.

28:13.039 --> 28:16.129
The little girl who loved
People's Courtmade it

28:16.172 --> 28:18.740
all the way,
and I want to savor it

28:18.784 --> 28:21.830
in my own way, on my own,
with everyone coming over

28:21.874 --> 28:23.963
and doing exactly
what I want them to do

28:24.006 --> 28:25.573
at every moment
without being asked.

28:25.616 --> 28:28.445
Babe. You can't expect people
to know what you want

28:28.489 --> 28:29.925
without telling them.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.884
No one here is a mind reader,

28:31.927 --> 28:33.450
except maybe Valencia.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.104
She's into that occult stuff.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.410
Whatever.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.194
It doesn't matter.

28:38.238 --> 28:41.110
Let's... just go back in there

28:41.154 --> 28:42.068
and call it off.

28:42.111 --> 28:43.722
No.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.768
We're gonna go out there

28:46.812 --> 28:49.466
and tell people you graduated
right now.

28:49.510 --> 28:50.685
But...Hon.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.687
I listen to you
most of the time--

28:52.731 --> 28:55.037
almost all the time--
because you're smart

28:55.081 --> 28:56.517
and I respect you,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.519
but you're wrong
about this.

28:58.562 --> 29:01.043
It's time for you
to listen to me.

29:15.841 --> 29:16.580
Hey, guys.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.147
So, um...

29:18.191 --> 29:20.323
I graduated from law school.

29:20.367 --> 29:21.803
Whoa.What? When?

29:22.804 --> 29:23.849
Last week.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.676
And you didn't tell
or invite anyone?

29:25.720 --> 29:26.895
Who was your
graduation speaker?

29:26.939 --> 29:28.201
Was it Mindy Kaling?

29:28.244 --> 29:30.769
She spoke at
Harvard Law in 2014.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.250
What? I stan.I just...

29:34.294 --> 29:38.515
I have trouble
celebrating myself,

29:38.559 --> 29:42.258
and it may stem from an incident
at my 11th birthday party

29:42.302 --> 29:45.174
where my dad told everyone
I had breast buds.

29:46.088 --> 29:46.828
Dads.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.395
Yep.But...

29:48.438 --> 29:49.352
Scott is right.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.093
And, um, I need to learn

29:51.137 --> 29:53.095
how to tell people
what I want

29:53.139 --> 29:55.402
and what I need
and how I feel.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.708
Look, you guys,
if you don't want to play

29:57.752 --> 30:00.233
my law-themed game
or any game tonight,
that is fine.

30:00.276 --> 30:03.149
We can just relax
and talk and drink and...

30:03.192 --> 30:04.498
NATHANIEL:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:04.541 --> 30:05.847
Not play games? Screw that.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.849
Chan and I got a game to win.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.372
Really?Yeah, we do.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.373
Yeah, come on, Chan, batter up.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.245
Ready?

30:12.288 --> 30:13.724
Yeah.All right.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.465
Look right here, right here.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.206
Yeah, yeah, oh,
yeah, right there.

30:18.512 --> 30:21.254
Okay. He coached a team in L.A.,

30:21.297 --> 30:24.866
uh, made up of women who
murdered celebrity opponents.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.041
Charles Manson?

30:26.085 --> 30:27.129
Yes!

30:27.173 --> 30:28.000
What?
Wow.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.392
Um, all right,
um, okay.

30:29.436 --> 30:32.743
This dude lied about an
at-bat with an opponent

30:32.787 --> 30:35.529
who wore a blue uniform
she saved in her closet.

30:35.572 --> 30:37.096
Bill Clinton!Yes!

30:37.139 --> 30:38.314
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

30:38.358 --> 30:40.142
Okay, so this is the
lady who tells you how

30:40.186 --> 30:42.710
to sweep home plate and grill
the hot dogs for the game,

30:42.753 --> 30:45.539
and she went to jail
for something financial,

30:45.582 --> 30:47.367
but it's too confusing
for you to understand.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.021
Martha Stewart!Yes!

30:51.327 --> 30:52.067
Time!

30:52.111 --> 30:53.895
Yes! Whoo!

30:53.939 --> 30:57.072
Did we win?No, no. Paula and Scott
scored, like,

30:57.116 --> 30:58.421
twice as many
as we did.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.162
But, dude, come on, what
a great showing, right?

31:00.206 --> 31:01.468
I'm proud of us!

31:01.511 --> 31:02.948
You played the game right!

31:02.991 --> 31:04.427
BOTH:
We played the game right!

31:04.471 --> 31:05.907
Yeah! Yeah!Come on!

31:05.951 --> 31:07.126
Played the game right.Yes...

31:07.169 --> 31:08.388
played the game right.

31:20.748 --> 31:23.098
All right, look, I get
that you're scared of me.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.404
And there's a reason for that.

31:24.447 --> 31:25.884
Because you're very mean to me?

31:25.927 --> 31:27.581
Right. I'll admit it. I am.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.061
Why? Why, Valencia?

31:29.104 --> 31:31.193
I've always
just been nice to you.

31:31.237 --> 31:32.629
Yes, exactly.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.588
You're nice to me
and to everyone else.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.242
You're nice and
easygoing and fun,

31:36.285 --> 31:37.983
and everyone likes
you more than me.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.246
Our kindergarten class,
our Sunday school teacher,

31:40.289 --> 31:42.291
the bus driver,
and even Josh.

31:42.335 --> 31:45.425
It's so easy for you,
and it makes me jealous.

31:45.468 --> 31:46.861
That's not true.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.384
Not everyone likes me.

31:48.428 --> 31:50.517
There is one person who I liked

31:50.560 --> 31:52.519
who never liked me.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.086
Oh, please, who?
The smelly gym teacher?

31:54.129 --> 31:56.827
Hector, why did you care
if he liked you? He smelled.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.133
No. You.

31:58.177 --> 31:59.439
You, Valencia.

31:59.482 --> 32:02.094
You like me?

32:02.137 --> 32:03.486
Of course I do.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.749
You're smart and cool
and hella fashionable.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.751
I want to be friends.

32:07.795 --> 32:09.362
Why didn't you
ever say that?

32:09.405 --> 32:11.973
You were too busy yelling at me.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.844
Oh.

32:13.888 --> 32:15.716
I'm sorry.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.066
I won't do that anymore.

32:18.110 --> 32:19.807
You won't?

32:19.850 --> 32:22.201
No way. Now that I know
you're a fan?

32:22.244 --> 32:24.159
I love my fans.

32:26.205 --> 32:28.772
Okay. Cool.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.951
We'll have to practice that.

32:44.571 --> 32:47.139
Wow.

32:47.182 --> 32:50.620
This was a surprise.Yeah.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.622
I'm glad you came over.Me, too.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.455
Hey, Greg?Hmm.

32:59.499 --> 33:01.936
I, uh...

33:01.980 --> 33:04.678
I don't want to mess this up.

33:04.721 --> 33:08.464
I still have a teeny,
tiny tendency to mess things up.

33:08.508 --> 33:12.338
So what? We both do.
Everyone does.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.515
So you think we can do this?

33:15.558 --> 33:18.213
You think we can...

33:18.257 --> 33:22.261
start again for the...

33:22.304 --> 33:23.740

33:23.784 --> 33:25.351

Hey, man, what you doing?

34:39.729 --> 34:42.558
Oh, uh, this fridge has
good light, and, like I said,

I'm trying to get

Huh.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.925
Right there?

35:01.969 --> 35:04.537
Selfies for that Fett thing?Yeah.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.408
I think you need a fill light.

35:06.452 --> 35:07.670
Oh, yeah.Oh, yes. Yeah, that'd be dope.

35:07.714 --> 35:09.107

35:12.893 --> 35:14.112
Just relax. Okay.Hmm.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.331
Is this for the Fett thing?

35:16.375 --> 35:17.550
You know,
this is gonna look too staged.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.160
I'll be candid in the back.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.422
Good call.Yes.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.597
Yeah. Yeah.All right.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.164
Cool.Super natural.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.167
Right? Just relax.
Everything's normal.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.517
Now think
about the underwear.Hmm.

35:28.561 --> 35:31.172
This is a great graduation
party.
HECTOR:
Josh, flex that left tricep.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.153
No reason.
Just want to help out.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.484
She pooped on me a ton.

37:49.528 --> 37:51.747
I smelled it.
So maybe that's a compliment?

37:58.798 --> 38:00.495
I got a text. Paula needs us.

So, lucky for us,

Gary's friends

never picked up his cake.

you didn't tell us about it,

an influencer,

39:10.086 --> 39:13.002
so she got up on the chairs
and took pictures of our food.

39:13.046 --> 39:14.961
But at least
I'm back out there.

39:15.004 --> 39:18.747
Hey, wait a minute. If you two
are here, who's with the baby?

39:18.791 --> 39:21.141
"Speak softly.

39:21.184 --> 39:24.144
"Feed frequent snacks.

39:24.187 --> 39:26.059
Give them something to suck on"?

39:26.102 --> 39:27.365
Wow.

39:27.408 --> 39:30.585
You know, some of this works
for adults, too.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.329
Paula, you know
I would have loved

39:35.373 --> 39:37.070
to go to graduation with you.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.333
I know. I know.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.117
I messed up.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.989
I mean, I-I should've
told everyone,

39:43.032 --> 39:44.251
but, I mean, most of all,

39:44.294 --> 39:45.992
I really should have told you.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.168
Yeah, it's okay. It's okay.
It's in the past.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.517
Okay.

39:49.561 --> 39:50.910
I'm so proud of you.

39:50.953 --> 39:52.128
Oh!Come here.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.695
So proud.Thank you.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.219
Oh.

39:56.263 --> 39:59.353
And, Paula, I got something
to tell you, too.Yeah?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.181
So, tonight
I was babysitting Hebby,

40:01.224 --> 40:02.443
and Greg was there.Uh-huh.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.227
And, uh...

40:04.271 --> 40:05.751
we kissed.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.840
PAULA:
Oh.And then...

40:07.883 --> 40:10.016
we had some sex.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.452
PAULA:
What? Where?

40:11.496 --> 40:14.281
REBECCA: On the floor
of Darryl's living room.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.109
Oh! Oh!

40:16.152 --> 40:18.067
I mean, so romantic?

40:18.111 --> 40:19.634
It actually was really romantic.

40:19.678 --> 40:22.507
Really?It was so romantic.
It feels different, Paula.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.509
It's different this time.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.554
Greg makes me feel like I'm...

40:29.775 --> 40:31.472
...like I'm okay

40:31.516 --> 40:34.475
because he's
so much more okay now, you know?

40:34.519 --> 40:35.955
And like...

40:35.998 --> 40:38.958
maybe we could be
the best versions of ourselves

40:39.001 --> 40:40.873
if we're together.

40:40.916 --> 40:44.529
So, what does that
mean? What now?I don't know.

40:44.572 --> 40:47.183
But...

40:47.227 --> 40:50.056
I really think
there's something there.

40:53.102 --> 40:55.365
So, keep that under your hat.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.455
I will. I'm not
gonna say a word.Cheers.
