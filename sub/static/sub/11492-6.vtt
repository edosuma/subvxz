So, you're a free man

00:39.149 --> 00:40.416
What are your plans?

00:40.417 --> 00:42.918
I don't know. Probably
just catch up on my reading,

take a walk on the beach,

00:44.087 --> 00:45.387
you know, a little "me" time.

00:45.388 --> 00:46.355
What about you?

00:46.356 --> 00:48.257
Pretty much the same.

00:48.258 --> 00:49.558
Except instead of
reading and walking,

00:49.559 --> 00:52.127
I'm going on a date

00:52.128 --> 00:55.564

Hmm!

01:04.241 --> 01:07.977
So. You're back
in the dating game.

01:07.978 --> 01:09.245
How'd you hook up?

01:09.246 --> 01:10.412
Was it a "meet cute"?

01:10.413 --> 01:12.615
Meet... cute?

01:12.616 --> 01:14.250
You know, like, uh,
like in the movies.

01:14.251 --> 01:15.951
She's carrying groceries,
and you bump into her

01:15.952 --> 01:18.020
and she spills them
and you try to help her

01:18.021 --> 01:20.706
pick 'em back up, and you bonk
heads, and she's concerned

01:20.707 --> 01:23.825
she might have a concussion,
so you tell her you're a doctor,

01:23.826 --> 01:26.195
and you keep up the ruse until
after she's fallen in love

01:26.196 --> 01:27.863
with you, at which
point you confess

01:27.864 --> 01:29.732
that you're not the man
she thought you were,

01:29.733 --> 01:31.833
and she's furious and
never wants to talk to you,

01:31.834 --> 01:33.352
but you go to her place of work,

01:33.353 --> 01:35.020
and you make a
complete fool of yourself

01:35.021 --> 01:36.572
by declaring your
undying love for her

01:36.573 --> 01:38.057
during an important
business meeting.

01:38.058 --> 01:41.310
Thankfully, the meeting
is with Japanese bankers

01:41.311 --> 01:43.195
who find you charming.

01:43.196 --> 01:44.780
And they give her
the big account,

01:44.781 --> 01:46.482
after which you scoop
her into your arms

01:46.483 --> 01:49.218
and ask her to marry you, and
you live happily ever after.

01:51.988 --> 01:55.257
In Portland.

01:56.593 --> 01:58.794
Um... no.

01:59.996 --> 02:01.163
She's a dermatologist

02:01.164 --> 02:03.299

mole off my ass.

02:03.300 --> 02:07.269
Oh, well, that's cute, too.

02:07.270 --> 02:09.104
So, uh, what's her
name? How old is she?

02:09.104 --> 02:11.907
Uh, her name's Michelle,
and I'm guessing mid-'30s.

02:11.908 --> 02:13.676
Ooh! Almost age-appropriate.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.052
Sure, I'll pull
it out over dinner.

02:23.053 --> 02:25.020

really about, don't you?

09:29.936 --> 09:33.739
Yeah. When I'm 58,
she'll be 70!

09:35.275 --> 09:37.242

Look at it this way:

09:38.778 --> 09:42.514
When she's 70, you're likely
to have been dead for ten years.

09:42.515 --> 09:46.852

me feel a little better.

11:37.256 --> 11:38.340
You broke up
with Sarah

11:38.341 --> 11:40.158
so you could hook up

11:40.159 --> 11:41.493
No, no.

they're right or wrong.

Have you considered
dating someone a little older?

19:18.617 --> 19:22.553
I tried that once;
it was disgusting.

19:22.554 --> 19:24.923
Really?

19:24.924 --> 19:26.791
The guy was almost 35.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.260
It was like sleeping with
my grandfather.

19:30.095 --> 19:31.996
No kidding.

19:31.997 --> 19:33.831
He could only do it
twice in a row

19:33.832 --> 19:35.667
before he needed to take a nap.

19:35.668 --> 19:37.702
Uh-huh.

19:37.703 --> 19:40.638
Excuse me.

19:40.639 --> 19:41.906
Hey, Michelle,

over Chelsea!

Geez, Charlie,
what are you gonna be like
