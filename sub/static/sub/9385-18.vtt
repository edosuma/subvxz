00:36.203 --> 00:37.496
Ah, thanks for
coming, Lois.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.872
Mark's been trying
to get me

00:38.956 --> 00:40.666
to see his one-man
show for weeks.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.210
Oh, I think it's wonderful
you're supporting your old pal.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.922
Go long, Eddie, go long.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.674
Further, further.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.759
Ah...

00:50.843 --> 00:53.470
Life sure was crazy
growing up in Brooklyn.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.013
We had some real characters
in my neighborhood.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.557
Like Frank, the mailman.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.392
( in Brooklynese ):
Hey, Mark, the ants

00:58.475 --> 01:00.686
for your ant farm came today.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.729
( chuckles ): And my friend, Lonny,
that knucklehead.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.439
( with same accent ):
Yo, Marky!

01:04.523 --> 01:06.191
Let's play some b-ball.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.568
B-ball,
that's what we called it.

01:07.651 --> 01:09.278
B-ball.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.445
And my grandma.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.780
Boy, was she something else.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.156
( with same accent ):
Hey, Marky!

01:13.240 --> 01:15.325
Don't forget to take
your cod liver oil.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.327
( nervous coughs )

01:17.411 --> 01:18.871
Great job.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.914
God, what a piece
of self-indulgent crap.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.208
All the characters sounded
exactly the same.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.626
( in Brooklynese ):
Great show, Mark.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.086
( same accent ): Yeah, you captured
me perfectly.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.005
( same accent : Me, too.
You are so talented.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.090
That was awful.
You know, wi-with a little practice

01:30.174 --> 01:31.842
I could act circles
around that guy.

01:31.967 --> 01:35.053
Oh, yeah? Well, then,
put up or shut up.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.222
"This Thursday, auditions
for the Quahog School

01:37.306 --> 01:38.974
of Performing Arts'
upcoming semester."

01:39.057 --> 01:40.184
You should try out.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.019
Oh, you know, that's
not a bad idea, Lois.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.855
Okay, ready for the best acting
you've seen all night?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.398
Mark, wow.
What a journey.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.108
Thank you so much.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.694
I... Those three and a half hours
just flew by.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.364
Hey, Santos,
Pasqual, listen.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.992
You guys have done
such good work today

01:57.075 --> 01:58.744
I got a surprise for you.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.828
Doritos.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.164
Huh? Not now.
Later.

02:02.539 --> 02:06.251
( speaking Portuguese )

02:13.258 --> 02:15.302
MAN:
Help! Help!

02:15.385 --> 02:16.803
Oh, my God.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.226
( voice quivering :
Thank you.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.435
I was boogie boarding

02:23.519 --> 02:25.187
and I got sucked out
by the riptide.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.355
I thought I
was a dead man.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.439
Oh, you got to be starving.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.690
Here, eat these.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.235
( speaking Portuguese )

02:36.031 --> 02:38.659
Oh, my God, he was just floating
out there by himself?

02:38.742 --> 02:40.536
Yep, he was so grateful
I saved his life

02:40.619 --> 02:42.579
he invited us all over
for dinner tonight.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.331
-Oh, good, I don't have to cook.
-Oh, no, no.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.375
Go ahead and cook anyway, Lois,
and we'll throw it out.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.459
I don't want you to get rusty.

02:47.543 --> 02:48.544
Say, Peter?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.170
My audition's
coming up.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.880
W-Would you mind listening
to my monologue?

02:51.964 --> 02:54.049
Sure, buddy,
let's hear it.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.804
Julie, there's something I got
to tell you...

02:58.887 --> 03:00.556
Ha, that's awesome.
Go on.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.266
...um, uh, tell you.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.809
I-I saw Dr. Phil..."

03:03.892 --> 03:05.894
Wow, wow, yes, yes.
I love it.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.563
...Dr. Phillips today.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.523
I might not make
it to Christmas.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.941
Oh, yeah, drop the bomb.
Drop it.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.526
There's not a dry eye
in the house.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.986
Keep going.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.654
No, no, you know what?
I'm going to stop.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.905
Um, maybe we'll
work on it later.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.740
Okay, well, just
so you know, it was good

03:18.824 --> 03:20.200
but, uh, I was also being
pretty generous.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.997
Well, look at you,
you little jaybird.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.541
You want to tell your mommy
and daddy the Griffins are here?

03:27.624 --> 03:30.252
MAN:
Come on in!

03:30.335 --> 03:31.753
Welcome, Griffins.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.338
Oh, uh, uh...

03:33.422 --> 03:34.756
we must be early.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.341
WOMAN:
Oh, nonsense.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.968
You're right on time.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.511
Oh, my God,
she's got hair

03:39.595 --> 03:41.889
growing out of her boobs
and up to her head.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.516
You're, uh,
you're completely...

03:44.600 --> 03:46.643
Nude? Yes, we're nudists.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.187
Permission to freak out?

03:48.270 --> 03:49.605
Peter, did you know
about this?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.857
I-I thought he lost his
bathing suit in the ocean.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.443
So, you're the man who saved
my husband's life.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.694
Dotty Campbell.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.779
Oh, what am I doing?
Come here.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.198
Watch my hands, Lois.
Look, look.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.866
See where they are?
See? No touchy.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.202
And this is
the backyard.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.913
Feel that, that's premium
Blue-Tip Bermuda.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.331
Real hardy...
but soft.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.665
Oh, good Lord.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.042
Don't look directly
into it, Lois.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.919
The hot dogs
and burgers are ready.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.420
Can I get you
a beer, Peter?

04:13.504 --> 04:14.505
Uh, what have you got?

04:14.588 --> 04:15.589
I've got Busch.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.758
Oh, and Busch Lite.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.134
( car door slams )

04:19.218 --> 04:20.677
Oh, sounds like Jeff's home.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.679
Hey, sport, how'd you do?

04:22.763 --> 04:23.931
I got first place, Dad.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.641
Way to go, champ.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.560
Jeff plays varsity tennis
for St. Genevieve High.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.103
Oh, cool.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.772
Is this the biggest
thing you've ever seen?

04:31.855 --> 04:33.315
Hey, don't get too cocky.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.692
I had a big one like that
when I was your age.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.819
Oh, you were a showoff,
yourself, Dave.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.488
He brought it out
on our first date.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.739
Lois, I'm scared.

04:40.822 --> 04:41.949
Oh, I'll get that.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.033
Hey!

04:43.116 --> 04:44.117
Ah, oh, oh, God!

04:44.201 --> 04:45.202
Oh, Dave, sorry.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.286
Uh, oh, God.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.373
-Boobies!
-Chris, that's enough.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.916
Well, I'm sure glad
to be out of there.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.292
You said it, Lois.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.294
What those people
are doing just ain't natural.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.379
Boobies!

04:55.462 --> 04:56.922
Did you hear me, young man?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.257
I don't know what
the big deal was.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.550
-I thought they were nice.
-Boobies.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.552
-Peter?
-Do it.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.098
Did you have fun at the circus
today, Chris?

05:06.181 --> 05:08.183
Elephants are
bigger in person.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.858
Oh, break a leg
up there, Brian.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.943
You seem awfully
enthusiastic.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.486
Well, at first
I wanted you to fail.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.737
But then I realized

05:20.821 --> 05:22.531
you'd be out of the house
five days a week.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.534
Which means I'd me free to throw
some of my sexy parties.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.619
( all laughing )

05:27.703 --> 05:29.621
( music playing )

05:29.705 --> 05:31.707
( Stewie barks )

05:34.835 --> 05:36.712
( laughing continues )

05:36.795 --> 05:37.880
MAN:
Brian Griffin?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.089
Good luck, Brian.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.258
Uh, hi, I'm-I'm Brian Griffin.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.802
And this is from
John Walts' Leaving Wichita.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.765
Julie, there's something
I got to tell you.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.143
I saw Dr. Phillips today.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.562
I might not make it
to Christmas.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.480
( yawns ):
Thank you, next.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.567
Next? Now, ho-hold on, Brian.
Stay up there. Stay there.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.319
Now, see here.

06:00.402 --> 06:03.071
Brian Griffin is a brilliant
actor with talent and passion.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.782
But you alleged "experts"
obviously didn't notice.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.201
Well, I did notice.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.870
I saw a man bare his soul
up here.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.706
And his pain ran through my
heart like an errant locomotive.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.751
But it was wasted,
wasted on all of you.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.755
Well, it looks like we're going
to have to reconsider.

06:19.838 --> 06:20.881
Brian we want you...

06:20.964 --> 06:22.716
-Yes!
-...off the stage.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.177
But your young friend there
would make a perfect addition

06:25.260 --> 06:26.929
to the school's
Rising Star program.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.347
Oh, splendid.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.016
This calls for
a sexy party.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.561
( music plays )

06:38.899 --> 06:40.901
Okay, funcakes,
let's do a scene.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.027
Okay, uh, Stewie

06:42.110 --> 06:43.111
how about you?

06:43.195 --> 06:44.863
And, uh, let's see,
one of our veterans...

06:44.947 --> 06:46.073
um, Olivia.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.866
I'm not doing a scene with him.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.117
He's inexperienced.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.286
He'll drag
my whole performance down.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.371
Are you serious?

06:52.454 --> 06:53.580
Is she serious?

06:53.664 --> 06:54.665
Ah, okay, Stewie

06:54.748 --> 06:56.416
I'll give you a
solo exercise.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.001
Now, you're
going to do

06:58.085 --> 06:59.837
a little exercise
we call the "life cycle."

06:59.920 --> 07:01.171
Now, without using words

07:01.255 --> 07:03.090
you're going to act out
your entire life

07:03.173 --> 07:05.384
from birth to death,
exactly as I describe it.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.552
Okay, ready?
Lie down.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.221
Now, you're being born.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.431
Ready, and...
burst through the placenta!

07:11.515 --> 07:12.766
Whoo!

07:12.850 --> 07:13.934
Okay, now, fast-forward.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.519
It's your first day of school.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.645
You're alone
and scared.

07:16.728 --> 07:17.729
( gasps )

07:17.813 --> 07:19.064
But it's all right,
it's all right.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.190
-It's Sloppy Joe day.
-Oh!

07:20.274 --> 07:21.567
Okay, pull it back.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.069
The lady touched the bun,
and she's not wearing gloves.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.655
-Ooh!
-Okay, fast-forward. You're a businessman.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.240
You manage a lot of people.

07:28.323 --> 07:31.076
And here comes Henderson,
and he lost the big account.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.160
You're mad.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.328
Madder!

07:33.412 --> 07:34.955
Madder!

07:35.038 --> 07:36.331
Come on, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, ooh.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.457
Ooh, there it is,
you got it.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.584
And fast-forward.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.710
You're an
old man now.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.961
You're on your
death bed.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.880
Your son is there,
holding your hand.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.590
You tell him
you accept his lifestyle

07:44.673 --> 07:47.176
and regret humiliating him
at his only sister's wedding

07:47.259 --> 07:49.386
by introducing him as
your "other daughter."

07:49.469 --> 07:51.138
And... scene.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.389
Okay, any comments?

07:54.183 --> 07:56.101
You are the weakest link.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.311
Good-bye.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.478
( laughter )

07:58.562 --> 07:59.730
( laughing )

07:59.813 --> 08:01.190
Oh, gosh, that's funny.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.608
That's really fu...

08:02.691 --> 08:04.610
Do-Do you write
your own material?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.486
Do you?
Because that is so fresh.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.405
"You are the weakest link.
Good-bye."

08:08.488 --> 08:11.283
You know, I-I've never heard
anyone make that joke before.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.701
Hmm, you're the first.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.245
I've never heard anyone
reference... reference that

08:15.329 --> 08:16.538
outside the program before.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.249
Because th-that's what she says
on the show, right? Isn't it?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.210
"You are the Weakest Link.
Good-bye."

08:21.293 --> 08:24.755
And-And yet you've taken that
and-and used it out of context

08:25.297 --> 08:27.716
to insult me
in this everyday situation.

08:28.050 --> 08:31.011
God, what a clever,
smart girl you must be

08:31.094 --> 08:34.681
to come up with-with a joke
like that all by yourself.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.517
Hmm, that's so fresh, too.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.311
Any-Any Titanic jokes
you want to throw at me

08:39.436 --> 08:41.522
as long as we're hitting
these phenomena

08:41.605 --> 08:43.857
at the height
of their popularity? Hmm?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.025
'Cause I'm-I'm here.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.569
God, you're so funny!

08:51.323 --> 08:52.324
Jeff:
Meg?

08:52.407 --> 08:54.660
Jeff! Wow, hey,
what you doing here?

08:54.743 --> 08:56.954
They had a sale
on Super Soakers.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.372
Check it out.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.540
( laughing)

08:59.623 --> 09:01.124
Ah, what the heck?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.292
Nudist!

09:02.376 --> 09:04.211
My dad's a tailor,
you jerk!

09:05.087 --> 09:06.463
Oh, gosh, that's awful.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.840
Ah, that's all right.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.049
I'm used to it.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.676
Well, I better go.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.220
So, um, would
you want to do something sometime?

09:13.512 --> 09:14.847
Sure, that'd be great!

09:14.930 --> 09:16.515
Cool. I'll call
you later.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.736
Holy moley,
it must be my birthday.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.242
( blowing sounds )

09:37.744 --> 09:39.246
( flatulence )

09:40.622 --> 09:42.040
( embarrassed chuckle )

09:42.124 --> 09:43.667
Th... thank you.

09:43.750 --> 09:47.796
Thank you, that-that was...
um... "Me Farting"

09:47.880 --> 09:49.840
by... by Chopin.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.008
( chuckles )

09:51.091 --> 09:52.843
Thank-Thank you.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.219
Thank you ver...

09:54.303 --> 09:55.554
Thank you very...

09:59.224 --> 10:01.143
So, Olivia...
beautiful day.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.437
You're not going to
fart again, are you?

10:05.147 --> 10:07.524
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,
but you're a total bitch.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.534
WOMAN: The quarterly review's
tomorrow.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.952
Think all your kids
will pass?

10:19.036 --> 10:20.412
Well, I'll tell you
who's not going to pass.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.789
It starts with an "O"
and rhymes with Bolivia.

10:22.873 --> 10:23.999
Give up? Olivia.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.334
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.668
She's such
a little frosty box.

10:26.752 --> 10:27.878
She won't work
with anybody.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.713
And Stewie Griffin
is also on the fence.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.089
If he and Olivia
don't deliver

10:31.173 --> 10:33.133
at their quarterly reviews,
I'm just going to have

10:33.217 --> 10:34.927
to kick their cute
little bottoms out of here.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.011
( gasps )

10:40.557 --> 10:43.477
Uh, this table is reserved
for people with talent.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.770
Stow the 'tude,
queenie!

10:44.853 --> 10:46.396
You and I have
a problem!

10:46.480 --> 10:47.606
Read it and weep!

10:47.689 --> 10:49.274
"Doesn't work well
with others"?

10:49.358 --> 10:50.609
Yes, mine's no better.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.319
I'll spare you the details.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.571
Suffice it to say
the phrase "garden variety"

10:54.655 --> 10:55.948
appears a number of times.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.574
What am I going to do!

10:57.658 --> 10:59.034
What are we going to do?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.577
Look, our evaluation's tomorrow.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.329
You need someone to work with

11:02.412 --> 11:04.790
and, well, I need someone
to make me look good.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.124
I don't know...

11:06.208 --> 11:07.459
Well, fine,
refuse my offer

11:07.543 --> 11:10.170
get booted out of this place,
and wind up like Linda Evans.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.756
MAN ( over P.A. ) Linda Evans, we have
a spill in aisle nine.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.842
Linda Evans,
spill in aisle nine.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.137
Do you like yours
with crust or without?

11:19.221 --> 11:20.347
How do you like yours?

11:20.472 --> 11:22.182
Okay, let's both answer
at the same time.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.018
One, two, three.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.270
-Without.
-Without.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.647
Holy moley, that's eight things
we have in common!

11:28.730 --> 11:30.274
Kids, we're home.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.483
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.943
You guys remember Jeff?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.653
Sure! Lois, I'm going
to borrow your mace.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.196
( screams )

11:36.280 --> 11:37.281
That's better.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.032
So, Meg,
did any of the neighbors

11:39.116 --> 11:40.409
see Jeff come over?

11:40.492 --> 11:42.953
Mom! Come on, Jeff,
let's go in the other room.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.621
Now, Meg, no need
to get so testes..

11:44.705 --> 11:45.706
uh, testy...

11:45.789 --> 11:46.790
Oh, nuts!

11:46.874 --> 11:47.916
I mean, crap!

11:48.000 --> 11:49.168
You want to sit down?

11:49.251 --> 11:50.252
Wait a second,
don't sit down yet.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.297
Dad, what are you doing?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.799
I'm, uh-uh,
keeping the couch fresh.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.467
-Dad!
-It's okay, Meg.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.970
I understand what's going
on here. I'm going to go.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.805
Oh! Just, uh-uh,
step on these coasters

12:01.889 --> 12:02.890
on your way out.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.391
Here we go, yeah.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.601
Yeah, d-don't step
on the hot lava.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.436
The carpet is hot lava.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.230
I can't believe you guys!

12:10.314 --> 12:12.900
Meg, how could you bring
that naked kid into our house?

12:12.983 --> 12:14.109
Because I like him.

12:14.193 --> 12:15.777
He remembers my name.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.362
Well, I'm sorry,
honey

12:17.446 --> 12:18.822
but we don't think
you should see him anymore.

12:18.906 --> 12:19.907
( gasps )

12:21.408 --> 12:23.327
Oh, I hate the sound
of her crying.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.953
You know what sounds
even worse?

12:25.329 --> 12:26.663
( annoying screech )

12:26.830 --> 12:28.123
Ah, listen to that.

12:28.207 --> 12:30.334
( screech )

12:30.542 --> 12:31.668
Don't you hate that?

12:31.793 --> 12:32.920
( screech )

12:33.045 --> 12:34.087
That is awful.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.297
( screech )

12:35.380 --> 12:36.507
I think it's easier on me

12:36.590 --> 12:38.091
'cause I'm the one
making the sound.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.052
( screeching )

12:42.471 --> 12:43.889
Okay, nice effort, Brad

12:43.972 --> 12:46.058
but, uh, let's remember
our performance hierarchy:

12:46.141 --> 12:48.644
legitimate theater,
musical theater, stand-up

12:48.727 --> 12:50.062
ventriloquism, magic, mime.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.605
All right,
next up is Olivia.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.233
Liv, what monologue
are you doing for us this time?

12:54.316 --> 12:56.985
I'm not doing a monologue,
I'm doing a piece with Stewie.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.403
A duet? Really?

12:58.487 --> 12:59.613
Well, let's see it.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.990
Uh, five, six,
seven, eight..

That's for me ever having
doubted you. "A" plus!

14:17.482 --> 14:19.943
And that's for you
wearing purple pants

14:20.027 --> 14:21.737
with blue socks. Ew!

14:22.070 --> 14:23.947
I totally called
him on it.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.494
Okay, no secrets.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.872
I want to share Stewie
and Olivia with the world.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.665
Well, they're
awfully young.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.167
Is this really
a good idea?

14:35.250 --> 14:36.543
It's a great idea.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.128
I've always dreamed
of becoming an actress

14:38.212 --> 14:40.380
but that's not why I'm
pushing Olivia to do it.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.591
Is it suspicious that I brought
that up unprovoked?

14:42.674 --> 14:44.718
Well, I guess
it might be okay.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.553
Sure, Lois, I mean,
look at Elroy Jetson.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.639
He was a child actor
and he turned out just fine.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.433
You know who I am?

14:51.517 --> 14:53.268
I'm Elroy Jetson.

You were amazing!

Oh, so were you.

15:24.508 --> 15:25.843
Well, it was a good crowd.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.928
They didn't even notice
that you missed that F-sharp.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.305
Yes, well... beg pardon?

15:30.389 --> 15:31.431
The F-sharp, darling.

15:31.515 --> 15:32.683
You were just slightly off.

15:32.766 --> 15:33.976
I'm pretty sure I wasn't.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.644
Oh, well, maybe
it was me.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.770
Must have been you.

15:36.854 --> 15:37.980
I was being sarcastic.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.106
Well, it wasn't me.

Peter, do you think maybe
it was unfair of us

15:57.040 --> 15:58.625
to tell Meg
she couldn't see that boy?

15:58.709 --> 16:00.752
Oh, completely. We
totally reamed her.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.379
Did you see that

Meet you inside.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.145
Pretty exciting.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.438
What? The marquee
or the other thing?

16:19.521 --> 16:20.564
What other thing?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.482
You know,
the sex with Simon.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.401
Why else would your
name be first?

16:24.484 --> 16:25.652
Well, it's obvious.

16:25.736 --> 16:27.237
You know, lead with strength

16:27.321 --> 16:29.615
put your best foot forward,
et cetera, et cetera.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.283
So, the sex was good?

16:31.366 --> 16:33.744
Oh, shut up,
you egotistical jerk!

16:33.827 --> 16:35.537
You shut up,

Jeff! What are
you doing here?

16:50.093 --> 16:51.678
Look, I'm not supposed
to see you.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.013
Your parents invited me.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.306
My parents?
But they wouldn't...

16:54.389 --> 16:55.807
Yes, we would.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.226
Oh, my God! What
are you doing?

16:57.309 --> 16:58.727
We were wrong, Meg.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.729
If you like Jeff, we
should give him a chance.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.190
Yeah, and we wanted him
to feel welcome in our home.

17:03.273 --> 17:06.193
Mom, I need new batteries
for my walkman.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.820
Hey, why is everybody
else naked?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.698
Yahtzee! I win!

17:11.782 --> 17:13.992
Yeah, in your face!
In your face!

17:14.076 --> 17:15.202
In your face!

17:15.285 --> 17:16.870
( screams )

17:16.954 --> 17:18.038
Uh, I got to get going.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.373
Thanks, Mr.
and Mrs. Griffin.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.457
Our pleasure, Jeff.

17:20.541 --> 17:21.583
Nice hanging with you, Jeff.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.918
I'm sorry about my parents.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.294
I hope they didn't
embarrass you.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.171
Are you kidding? I
think they're great.

17:26.547 --> 17:28.423
It took a lot of guts
for them to do what they did.

17:28.507 --> 17:29.508
I'll see you later.

17:32.261 --> 17:33.262
Thanks, you guys.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.346
That was really cool.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.807
Hey, Peter,
can I borrow your lawnmow...

17:36.890 --> 17:38.308
Ah... You folks
got a towel?

17:38.392 --> 17:39.601
Simon, would
you be a dear

17:39.685 --> 17:42.104
and ask Stewie to dance
on his own feet tonight?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.731
Pardon me, Simon, could you
provide Olivia with a bucket

17:44.815 --> 17:46.024
so she can carry a tune?

17:46.108 --> 17:48.068
People, people,
stop this craziness.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.945
The critic from the
Providence Journal is here.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.865
If he gives us a good
review, the doors are going to fly open.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.867
Now, go get them,
my little silly-billies.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.410
All right, let's just
get through this.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.494
Fine with me.

17:57.578 --> 17:59.788
Wait a minute.
You're wearing ruby lipstick.

17:59.872 --> 18:02.332
You're painted up like some
attention-grabbing Jezebel.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.001
Well, you're one to talk.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.086
You've been stuffing your diaper
since day one.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.213
It's where I keep
my peppermint Mentos.

18:08.297 --> 18:10.591
Just because your breath
reeks of rotten Lunchables

18:10.674 --> 18:11.925
doesn't mean mine has to.

18:28.192 --> 18:29.902
Break it up. Break it up!

18:29.985 --> 18:32.696
I don't need this act,
and I don't need you.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.531
You've done nothing
but hold me back.

18:34.615 --> 18:35.741
I quit!

18:35.824 --> 18:38.285
The only thing I've held you
back from is failure.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.913
Come on, Simon, we don't need
that little Bebe No-worth.

18:40.996 --> 18:42.581
I don't know, Stewie.

18:42.664 --> 18:44.917
Without Olivia, this act
is like Fire Island after Labor Day.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.168
Over.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.377
Fine, I don't need you.

18:47.461 --> 18:48.879
I can manage my own career.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.632

I'm-I'm quite capable of that.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.528
No, no, wait, wait.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.820
I was about to do this thing.

19:21.787 --> 19:23.872
Oh, hello.
Didn't notice you there.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.041
You know, it's not easy
living with my family--

19:26.124 --> 19:27.709
a bunch of characters they are.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.378

19:33.090 --> 19:35.092
Get off the stage!

19:37.886 --> 19:39.513
Oh, w-what do you
say, Bernie?

19:39.596 --> 19:41.098
Two nights at the old rate?

19:41.181 --> 19:44.226
Like I told you before, kid,
I can't book you without Olivia.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.228
But that's the good news.
We're back together.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.312
She's right here.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.357
Hi, Bernie, glad to be back.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.318
Ask Stewie
about his sexy parties.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.029
"Ask Stewie about
his sexy parties."

19:56.113 --> 19:57.239
What were you thinking?

19:57.322 --> 19:58.323
I was just trying...

19:58.407 --> 19:59.616
I'm not speaking to you.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.701
-But, Stewie.
-Shut up!

20:03.078 --> 20:05.372
I guess, I guess the best advice
I got was from

20:05.455 --> 20:06.957
Marty Scorsese.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.917
Um, I was having a problem

20:09.001 --> 20:10.752
understanding why
I'd be taking abuse

20:10.836 --> 20:14.298
from this lower-ranking officer
played by Chris O'Donnell

20:14.381 --> 20:15.966
and-and he told me

20:16.049 --> 20:18.927
"You don't have to understand
it, your character does."

20:19.261 --> 20:20.929
Oh, that always stuck with me.

20:21.013 --> 20:22.014
Stewie?

20:22.097 --> 20:23.599
Olivia, what are
you doing here?

20:23.682 --> 20:25.392
Oh, I must be an
absolute mess.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.227
The studio made me
fire my makeup girl.

20:27.311 --> 20:28.854
Oh, I, um...

20:28.937 --> 20:31.732
I just wanted to stop by
and see how you were doing.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.525
I had heard some things.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.110
Oh, that it's going
great for me?

20:35.194 --> 20:36.236
Well, you heard right.

20:36.445 --> 20:37.779
Oh, glad to hear that.

20:37.863 --> 20:38.947
But, hey, um..

20:39.448 --> 20:41.325
you know,
if you're not busy, um...

20:41.408 --> 20:43.577
what say you and I get
the old team back together?

20:43.660 --> 20:45.370
Well, actually, I can't.

20:45.454 --> 20:47.289
I'm on my way to Hollywood.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.416
I got this part
in a movie, and...

20:49.499 --> 20:51.335
Oh, oh, oh, what
am I thinking?

20:51.418 --> 20:52.711
I-I, you know,
I'd love to

20:52.794 --> 20:54.755
but I-I-I just...
I'm booked solid.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.216

episode guest shot

20:57.299 --> 20:58.800

20:58.884 --> 21:01.845
I play Rory's motorcycle
driving boyfriend.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.805
He's a bad boy at
heart, you know.

21:03.889 --> 21:06.016
But there's-there's some
good in there, Olivia

21:06.099 --> 21:07.684
and it comes
through absolutely.

21:07.768 --> 21:10.145

See you on the coast.

21:18.487 --> 21:19.613

let him have it?

21:19.696 --> 21:22.157
No, he let himself have it.

Hey, uh, how you doing, kid?

21:32.042 --> 21:33.627

21:33.710 --> 21:34.711
No, no, it's me, Brian.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.213
I brought what you wanted

21:36.296 --> 21:37.631
but they wouldn't
let me leave it.
