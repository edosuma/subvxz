00:00.524 --> 00:01.724
You guys met my sister, Val?

00:01.725 --> 00:05.494
I was diagnosed with MS when I was 22
and before that, I was a normal girl.

00:05.595 --> 00:08.520
- How advanced is it?
- I'm still fully functional.

00:10.255 --> 00:12.926
Look, I know I said
I didn't need any help, but...

00:13.027 --> 00:15.962
...tonight I did.
Thanks for the help.

00:17.347 --> 00:19.614
Hey, Abby.
Did you get your trinket from Carter?

00:19.715 --> 00:21.832
Gone-native junk for everybody.

00:22.659 --> 00:25.405
It was my father's.
I want you to have it.

00:25.506 --> 00:27.411
I want you to come back
to the States with me.

00:27.512 --> 00:30.230
I want our baby to be born in America.

00:31.357 --> 00:34.192
E. R. 10x11 "TOUCH AND GO"

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.299 --> 01:01.882
Remind me to put the clock
on your side of the bed.

01:16.491 --> 01:19.029
Hey, Kem? You down here?

01:23.249 --> 01:27.661
- Been in the kitchen since dawn.
- She's still adjusting to the time change.

01:28.003 --> 01:32.166
- Insisted on making me eggs again.
- Well, that's nice.

01:34.801 --> 01:36.676
That's not nice?

01:42.601 --> 01:44.926
- Good morning.
- Hey.

01:46.229 --> 01:47.807
Good morning.

01:47.981 --> 01:51.980
You know, you have got 20 types
of tea, like, six sets of china...

01:52.153 --> 01:54.726
...and glasses for every possible drink.

01:54.905 --> 01:57.194
Did you have trouble sleeping again?

01:58.033 --> 02:00.738
I had trouble finding the kitchen again.

02:00.911 --> 02:03.829
- I need a map.
- You get used to it.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.952
You'll be sliding in the hall
in socks in no time.

02:07.126 --> 02:09.996
- Oh, and that wouldn't offend anybody?
- Nope.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.955
Although, you should probably
stop making breakfast for Emily.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.789
She doesn't like my cooking?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.376
Doesn't like feeling insecure
about her employment.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.957
I'm gonna miss you today.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.183
You want George to show you
the sights after your appointment?

02:30.358 --> 02:35.732
- Do some shopping, go to a movie?
- I might take a walk.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.526
Would you rather I not work
while we're here?

02:38.699 --> 02:40.740
Because I don't have to.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.408
What I'd rather you do...

02:46.291 --> 02:47.868
...is give me your socks.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.460
What are you doing?

02:53.215 --> 02:54.590
What are you doing?

02:56.593 --> 02:59.843
So where is the bedroom, again?

03:08.355 --> 03:10.431
You coming or what?

03:11.400 --> 03:14.270
Abby, sorry. It took forever
to get Alex out of the house.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.235
- Don't worry.
- You already sign out?

03:16.404 --> 03:19.940
Yes. Too bad I can't leave.
Lelma Ramirez in 1, vomiting times three.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.822
- Tolerating sips after 10 of Reglan.
- Stomach-flu season?

03:22.995 --> 03:25.283
Dr. Lewis would have us believe.
She called in sick.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.125
- Really? How'd she sound?
- Better than she should have.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.866
Repeat EKG and troponin
on Mr. St. John at 8 a. m.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.452
Lewis probably has that flight nurse
in her bathrobe.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.872
- Is he pain-free?
- Mrs. Clark's had three nebs.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.885
- She may need continuous.
- Should I call in another Attending?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.460
No. Carter's on. We're good.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.513
So, what's his story?

03:43.683 --> 03:46.933
Richer and better-looking
than you or I will ever be. The end.

03:47.103 --> 03:49.558
I just wanna know if the guy's a jerk.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.936
- Is he?
- She's not the best one to ask.

03:52.107 --> 03:55.311
- There a problem with the narcotics?
- Missing 10 migs of Valium.

03:55.486 --> 03:59.733
- If you sign off, the night nurses can go.
- Yeah. Or they could just learn to count.

03:59.907 --> 04:03.952
My onset-seizure guy went to Medicine.
Rack is empty. And I am off the board.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.863
Good. Go home.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.372
- Saying I can leave early?
- I'm saying it's slow and you're an intern.

04:09.542 --> 04:12.496
- We'll be fine.
- Alrighty, then.

04:13.838 --> 04:16.411
- Get some rest, Mike.
- Yeah. Hope it stays slow for you.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.000
- What have you got?
- "Gome" from the home.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.963
- An elderly patient from a nursing home?
- Breakfast special.

04:21.137 --> 04:24.506
Staff went to check Granny's vitals
first thing. She didn't have any.

04:27.352 --> 04:29.344
Hey, sis.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.069
Hey, you wanna turn that down?

04:43.785 --> 04:47.119
Valerie, it's 7:00 in the morning.

04:47.873 --> 04:49.332
Mike.

04:49.499 --> 04:51.871
- You're home early.
- Baby, you have another razor?

04:52.085 --> 04:53.912
This one's dull.

05:01.011 --> 05:02.340
Good morning, Mike.

05:52.981 --> 05:54.890
- How many times?
- What?

05:55.066 --> 05:58.067
- How many times has he been here?
- None of your damn business.

05:58.236 --> 05:59.564
It's only my bedroom.

06:00.864 --> 06:02.358
Just a few.

06:04.534 --> 06:06.692
Now I know why you're interested
in my schedule.

06:06.870 --> 06:08.115
- Is there any coffee?
- No.

06:08.288 --> 06:09.568
Yes.

06:11.374 --> 06:14.625
I'm on the clock anyway.
I'll see you later?

06:17.714 --> 06:19.505
Peace, Mike.

06:21.176 --> 06:24.342
- What time you gotta be at the airport?
- My flight leaves at 2.

06:24.512 --> 06:26.220
Wake me up at noon.

06:28.434 --> 06:32.431
- Thought you were off.
- Not until she balances her narc count.

06:33.146 --> 06:35.020
- You wanna see me?
- January 18.

06:35.190 --> 06:39.235
Forget it. I've already got two Attendings
requesting Super Bowl Sunday off.

06:39.403 --> 06:42.024
- My last day here.
- Africa?

06:42.197 --> 06:44.902
I have to admit I'm surprised
you're still going back.

06:45.075 --> 06:46.569
Dr. Weaver!

06:46.743 --> 06:49.151
- She pulled out her Foley.
- Kovac will be there.

06:49.329 --> 06:51.999
Mrs. Webster's a boarder
being managed by Cardiology.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.324
Congestive failure and some dementia.

06:54.502 --> 06:57.953
Check her potassium and hit her again
with Lasix before she goes up.

06:58.130 --> 07:00.372
- So you'll notify Administration?
- About what?

07:00.549 --> 07:01.924
- My resignation.
- No.

07:02.092 --> 07:04.845
You will. Put it in writing
and leave it on my desk.

07:05.012 --> 07:07.930
I'll bring it to the Medical Executive
Committee in the morning.

07:08.099 --> 07:12.428
For the record, we need you here
as much as they do there.

07:14.855 --> 07:16.729
- Dr. Kovac.
- You're late.

07:16.899 --> 07:19.391
- Power outage at the Armitage station.
- Valerie again?

07:19.569 --> 07:22.107
I was gonna put a Swan-Ganz
in my cardiomyopathy guy.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.071
After load, reduce with enalapril.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.612
- How are you doing, Mrs. Webster?
- I wanna go home.

07:26.784 --> 07:29.026
- A mig of Bumex and 40 of K.
- I'm on it.

07:29.203 --> 07:32.703
Pressure's borderline.
I can't manage him without a Swann.

07:32.874 --> 07:34.913
- How are you doing?
- Give the ACE inhibitor.

07:35.084 --> 07:36.460
And support for dopamine.

07:36.627 --> 07:38.419
I love you.

07:39.422 --> 07:40.832
Thanks.

07:41.007 --> 07:43.545
If I know his wedge pressure,
I can do what I need.

07:43.718 --> 07:45.592
Dr. Kovac.

07:45.762 --> 07:48.431
My kids finished the chelation
therapy today.

07:50.141 --> 07:52.383
- They are coming home.
- That's good.

07:53.144 --> 07:56.561
You are going to be our only doctor
from now on, okay?

07:56.732 --> 07:59.104
Anyway, the Swann tells me
his output and PVR.

08:07.492 --> 08:12.617
Do walk rounds with the med students,
and I'll talk to you about it later, okay?

08:15.333 --> 08:17.290
- Patients really respond to him.
- Yeah.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.832
Give the differential diagnosis
of peripheral edema.

08:20.004 --> 08:21.334
- Cirrhosis.
- CHF.

08:21.507 --> 08:22.835
Thrombophlebitis.

08:23.008 --> 08:24.289
Lockhart.

08:24.468 --> 08:28.382
You belong to me at 4. You better
be sharper than that. Come on.

08:29.264 --> 08:30.972
What was that all about?

08:31.141 --> 08:32.801
Could this day suck more?

08:34.020 --> 08:36.142
Sign-in sheet's over there.

08:39.525 --> 08:42.275
- I'm not a patient.
- Hey, Dr. Carter.

08:42.443 --> 08:44.152
Nice to put a face to the name.

08:44.321 --> 08:46.564
- She with you?
- Yeah.

08:50.494 --> 08:52.819
Call me John. This is Kem.

08:52.997 --> 08:54.491
Hi. Sam.

08:54.665 --> 08:55.993
Pleasure to meet you.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.575
- So this is it?
- This is it.

08:58.753 --> 09:00.331
Double MVA, two minutes out.

09:00.505 --> 09:04.205
- Hey, stranger!
- How are you?

09:04.383 --> 09:06.091
Hi, everybody.

09:07.344 --> 09:09.586
- Hey, Malik.
- Welcome back, doc.

09:09.763 --> 09:13.180
- Good to see you.
- I heard you were coming in today. Hi.

09:13.351 --> 09:17.847
- And who is this lovely lady?
- Everybody, this is Kem Likasu.

09:18.022 --> 09:19.516
She's visiting from the Congo.

09:20.191 --> 09:21.601
- Welcome.
- Nice.

09:21.776 --> 09:23.567
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:23.736 --> 09:26.856
Kem has an appointment
with Dr. Subramanian upstairs.

09:27.032 --> 09:28.691
Dr. Subramanian from OB?

09:29.284 --> 09:31.490
Prenatal checkup. Second trimester.

09:32.995 --> 09:35.700
- Congratulations.
- That's so great.

09:35.873 --> 09:38.330
- Hey.
- Hey, Pratt. How are you?

09:38.502 --> 09:41.372
Life is good.
But I see it's better for you.

09:42.130 --> 09:43.541
- How are you doing?
- Hey.

09:43.715 --> 09:46.716
- So are you back on shift yet?
- About five minutes ago.

09:46.884 --> 09:50.088
- Can somebody show Kem upstairs?
- Okay, this way.

09:50.722 --> 09:53.260
- You're coming, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Start the paperwork.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.390
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

09:57.354 --> 09:58.931
- Behind you.
- What do you have?

09:59.105 --> 10:02.973
Larry Brodie, 44-year-old passenger.
Single car versus telephone pole.

10:03.152 --> 10:04.776
May have had a syncopal episode.

10:04.945 --> 10:07.697
- Bad bruising to the chest and belly.
- Who's worse off?

10:07.864 --> 10:10.071
- Dad by a long shot.
- Four units of O-neg...

10:10.242 --> 10:12.911
- ... and a portable chest, and an EKG?
- Sure.

10:13.078 --> 10:15.570
- Cool.
- I'm a second-year Resident too.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.406
- Barely.
- Pratt, take the driver.

10:20.878 --> 10:23.368
- Tell me his story.
-19-year-old restrained driver.

10:23.547 --> 10:25.623
Trying to wake his old man up
when he crashed.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.293
BP, 128/74.

10:27.468 --> 10:29.377
Cracked a few ribs. Got 6 of morphine.

10:29.553 --> 10:31.925
- What's with the collar?
- Custom-made by Dad.

10:32.097 --> 10:35.762
- What for?
- Ankylosing spondylitis.

10:36.643 --> 10:39.051
- Equal breath sounds.
- HemoCue's only 8.5.

10:39.229 --> 10:41.982
Well, he's profoundly anemic.
He's bleeding somewhere.

10:42.150 --> 10:44.475
- Pressure down to 76.
- You're back.

10:44.652 --> 10:47.059
- Where's my son?
- Let's squeeze in both units.

10:47.238 --> 10:50.404
- I've been holed up at the house.
- And not alone, either.

10:50.616 --> 10:53.534
Central-line kit and size 8 gloves.
Kem, right?

10:53.703 --> 10:57.119
- Cordis introducer gives more volume.
- Excellent, Morris.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.531
She was setting up the ARV therapy
in Kinshasa.

10:59.709 --> 11:01.369
Where's my son?

11:01.544 --> 11:03.620
- He needs help.
- Don't worry, Mr. Brodie.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.335
Your son's in good hands.
Someone you want us to call?

11:06.508 --> 11:07.836
- Your wife?
- No.

11:08.009 --> 11:10.251
- She died.
- One percent lido.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.805
- Did you ever meet her?
- Nope. Must've gotten past me.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.514
Set up for ultrasound.

11:18.645 --> 11:21.314
- Good to be home.
- Need another doc in here.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.225
Here.

11:23.608 --> 11:25.565
Is my dad next door?
I can't turn my head.

11:25.735 --> 11:27.526
- He's hanging in there.
- How's he doing?

11:27.695 --> 11:31.195
Probable rib fracture. The neck film
shows fusion and a bamboo spine.

11:31.366 --> 11:34.450
- Ankylosing spondylitis.
- Unusual bone disease at his age.

11:34.619 --> 11:37.324
Similar to juvenile arthritis.
Weakens the spine, though.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.739
Sucks living life in bubble wrap.

11:39.916 --> 11:43.749
Also has a big pulmonary contusion
and a small pneumo on the right.

11:43.921 --> 11:45.712
- What?
- There's a bruise on your lung.

11:45.881 --> 11:48.454
- You're having trouble breathing.
- May need to tube him.

11:48.633 --> 11:50.709
Give my dad another reason
to keep me inside.

11:50.886 --> 11:55.097
Call Anesthesia. They can do an LMA
or awake naso-tracheal while he's stable.

11:55.265 --> 11:58.765
You wanna call in the whole team. Your
African buddy wants to ban all tests.

11:58.936 --> 12:00.679
- What should I do?
- Isn't he the Attending?

12:00.854 --> 12:04.603
Hey, Taggart. Principal at your kid's
school wants you over there lickety-split.

12:04.775 --> 12:07.479
- What for?
- Don't know. Can't be good.

12:07.652 --> 12:09.895
Hey, you find another nurse
to cover for you.

12:10.072 --> 12:13.073
- Let's try nasal BiPAP. Thank you.
- I'll get it.

12:13.284 --> 12:15.525
- Where are the BiPAP masks?
- Bottom right drawer.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.240
Got the EKG.
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.

12:18.413 --> 12:20.489
- Neela, read it for me.
- I can do that.

12:20.665 --> 12:23.240
Left bundle branch block.
Can't see the ST segments.

12:23.419 --> 12:27.547
Probably not an acute MI,
but send a troponin.

12:27.715 --> 12:30.918
Can't visualize Morrison's pouch
with all this fat and air.

12:31.093 --> 12:34.047
- Where does it hurt, Mr. Brodie?
- Everywhere.

12:34.221 --> 12:39.216
Stay ahead four units of type-specific.
Hope his pressure stays up for a CT.

12:41.562 --> 12:43.519
He's fragile.

12:46.358 --> 12:47.818
- Is he mad?
- Who?

12:47.986 --> 12:51.604
My dad. I talked him into
letting me drive today.

12:51.781 --> 12:53.405
Oh, I'm sure he's not mad.

12:53.574 --> 12:55.946
Rales are worse.
Sats are down to 88.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.951
Might need to think about an airway.

12:58.329 --> 13:01.414
There's plenty of room to move
on BiPAP.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.575
Up his inspiratory pressure to 10.

13:03.751 --> 13:06.918
Dr. Carter, Kem called.
Dr. Subramanian's seeing her now.

13:07.463 --> 13:10.298
- She took her in early.
- Go. We're all over this.

13:11.968 --> 13:14.922
Okay, I'm only covering for Sam
until Severa gets here.

13:17.932 --> 13:19.676
What?

13:22.937 --> 13:25.013
- Kem.
- Look.

13:26.775 --> 13:30.274
Normal extremities.
Good fetal movement.

13:30.487 --> 13:34.650
- Any neural-tube defects?
- No. Looks great.

13:36.576 --> 13:38.616
It's our son.

13:39.246 --> 13:41.819
I couldn't help it. I wanted to know.

13:42.791 --> 13:44.285
He's beautiful, isn't he?

13:44.501 --> 13:46.458
A son?

14:00.475 --> 14:01.720
- Well?
- Count's the same.

14:01.893 --> 14:04.930
- Abby, that's totally wack.
- Don't make me call the union rep.

14:05.106 --> 14:08.854
Okay, I'm gonna call Weaver at home,
see if she'll cut us a break.

14:14.156 --> 14:16.030
It's ringing.

14:18.828 --> 14:20.286
Hi.

14:20.454 --> 14:21.830
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah?

14:21.997 --> 14:23.492
It's Abby.

14:23.666 --> 14:26.916
- Yeah, we found the missing Valium.
- It was Weaver?

14:27.711 --> 14:31.330
Yeah. Someone actually left it
in their lab coat pocket.

14:32.258 --> 14:36.172
I'll pass that along.
Says whoever did it is an idiot.

14:36.345 --> 14:38.338
- I'm out of here.
- Make that a double.

14:57.701 --> 15:00.701
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:01.037 --> 15:04.453
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good.

15:04.624 --> 15:06.701
- I'm Abby.
- Kem. Good to meet you.

15:06.877 --> 15:09.450
You too. Welcome. And welcome back.

15:10.672 --> 15:12.914
- How have you been?
- Good.

15:13.091 --> 15:15.961
- I'm back in med school.
- Really?

15:18.262 --> 15:19.888
What's this?

15:20.682 --> 15:22.971
That's an ultrasound.

15:30.108 --> 15:31.650
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:31.818 --> 15:33.646
Must be Kem.

15:34.321 --> 15:35.696
- Are you Luka?
- Yeah.

15:38.617 --> 15:42.116
- Wasn't for you, we wouldn't have met.
- Yeah.

15:42.454 --> 15:44.910
So boy or a girl?

15:45.082 --> 15:46.909
- It's-
- It's a boy.

15:47.084 --> 15:49.373
- Handsome.
- Like his daddy.

15:50.457 --> 15:52.081
Well, I should probably...

15:52.250 --> 15:55.121
...get back to work.
Come on. I'll walk you out.

15:55.295 --> 15:58.047
- Sure. Good to meet you both.
- Bye.

16:02.344 --> 16:04.467
They got together after I left.

16:07.891 --> 16:09.552
- You okay?
- Yeah.

16:09.727 --> 16:11.304
Okay.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.558
What? Did he knock her up
the minute he got there?

16:18.360 --> 16:20.020
- Going home?
- No.

16:20.195 --> 16:22.438
On-call room. Same thing.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.412
Got a messy one here!

16:30.581 --> 16:31.956
- Let me go!
- What happened?

16:32.124 --> 16:36.169
Two stab wounds to the upper left thigh.
Tachy at 120. BP 90 palp. Lost 2 liters-

16:36.337 --> 16:37.879
- Back off, man!
- Easy. Even with direct pressure.

16:38.047 --> 16:40.716
- Over the femoral artery?
- Okay, let's have a look.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.171
- Can we fit a BP cuff above it?
- The injury's too high.

16:45.346 --> 16:46.888
- Undo my belt.
- What?

16:47.056 --> 16:48.467
He needs a tourniquet now.

16:48.933 --> 16:51.009
- Mine's thinner and cheaper.
- Leave me alone.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.969
- Leave me alone!
- Okay, wrap it as high as you can.

16:55.064 --> 16:56.475
Leave me alone!

16:57.983 --> 17:00.309
I can't get it tight enough.

17:01.404 --> 17:03.562
Got it.

17:03.740 --> 17:06.194
- Let's get him in Trauma 1.
- Get off me, man.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.739
- Where did you learn that?
- Sitting on a patient?

17:08.911 --> 17:11.319
- Congolese nurse named Mwadi.
- You getting down?

17:11.497 --> 17:14.582
- Get off me, man.
- Not until he's restrained or sedated.

17:14.751 --> 17:16.329
Stab wound. Out of the way, please.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.587
- You taking Mr. Brodie to CT?
- No. Chuny is. Why, you need help?

17:19.756 --> 17:23.503
Your patient's pressure is borderline.
Two units and a med student with you.

17:25.887 --> 17:27.512
Mrs. Webster, this is a busy road.

17:27.681 --> 17:30.088
- How do I get out?
- By getting treated and released.

17:30.267 --> 17:34.216
Now, let's get you back into bed before
another gurney comes around the corner.

17:34.395 --> 17:36.803
Oh, you're a good boy.

17:36.981 --> 17:39.022
That's what all the ladies say.

17:39.693 --> 17:42.694
Thirty-year-old mom
with a history of migraines.

17:42.863 --> 17:46.314
- Neuro exam is normal.
- No neck stiffness or fever. Good vitals.

17:46.491 --> 17:48.199
- Morris, you all right?
- Yeah.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.868
Mrs. Hulsey, are you still going
to the headache clinic?

17:52.039 --> 17:56.535
No money for a sitter or anything.
I had to bring my kids.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.703
Any chance they can get
something to eat?

17:58.879 --> 18:01.963
- Sure.
- Maybe hamburgers or hot dogs?

18:02.132 --> 18:04.505
- For breakfast?
- Just something hearty, you know?

18:04.677 --> 18:08.805
Like mashed potatoes, gravy and giblets?

18:14.811 --> 18:16.306
Sorry.

18:17.356 --> 18:19.016
Think you should be working?

18:20.359 --> 18:22.897
Yeah. Maybe I should call
somebody else in?

18:26.406 --> 18:28.031
Sympathy hurl.

18:29.619 --> 18:31.410
Even a sandwich would be okay.

18:32.205 --> 18:33.829
We're not picky.

18:33.998 --> 18:36.868
Mrs. Hulsey, when's the last time
you had anything to eat?

18:39.378 --> 18:43.542
I know he's not happy,
but he can't be an ordinary boy.

18:43.758 --> 18:45.418
Man.

18:45.593 --> 18:48.166
Martin's 19. You need to let
the guy live a little.

18:48.346 --> 18:50.634
- Does he need oral contrast?
- No. Just IV.

18:50.806 --> 18:53.807
We'll be right on the other side
of the glass, Mr. Brodie.

18:54.728 --> 18:56.436
All right, fire it up.

18:56.604 --> 18:58.763
His son's the one with
all the osteophytes?

18:58.940 --> 19:03.436
It's not like he wants to play football.
Just wants to get out once in a while.

19:03.945 --> 19:05.771
Make sure you stay still, okay?

19:07.449 --> 19:09.358
- Mr. Brodie?
- His pressure's down.

19:09.534 --> 19:11.906
- Pull him from the tube.
- Define his pathology.

19:12.078 --> 19:14.830
- How fast can you do this? Come on.
- Well, fast, but-

19:14.998 --> 19:17.037
- Wait, what are we doing?
- Getting the scan.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.498
- Hey, you need to wear lead.
- He's not wearing lead.

19:19.670 --> 19:21.709
- He's only getting one scan.
- I do this every day?

19:22.339 --> 19:23.999
Ladies first. Leave that alone.

19:24.174 --> 19:26.961
Spike another unit and squeeze it in.
Hurry up.

19:27.135 --> 19:29.128
And page Corday.

19:36.353 --> 19:38.642
- They your patients?
- Mom was.

19:38.814 --> 19:42.348
Thought her migraines were kicking up.
Then I noticed the hair and nails.

19:42.525 --> 19:47.188
Dermatitis, loss of fat from the cheeks.
She and the kids are starving to death.

19:47.364 --> 19:49.820
They'll get sick if we increase
calories too rapidly.

19:49.992 --> 19:52.909
Yeah, I'm admitting to Pedes
for slow re-feeding.

19:53.078 --> 19:55.035
She's beautiful, by the way.

19:55.205 --> 19:57.697
- So when are you going back?
- Two weeks.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.535
On my way up to Weaver's office...

19:59.710 --> 20:02.664
...to drop off my resignation letter.
How long you gonna stay?

20:02.838 --> 20:06.171
Kem's gonna go back and see her family
for a couple weeks.

20:06.341 --> 20:08.085
Then come back here and have the baby.

20:08.260 --> 20:11.345
- She miss home?
- Yeah, we both do.

20:11.514 --> 20:15.677
Hey, give yourself a week of hot showers
and an unlimited glove supply...

20:15.851 --> 20:17.559
...you'll miss it less.

20:19.939 --> 20:22.429
Dr. Carter. Martin's respiratory distress
is worse.

20:23.026 --> 20:27.023
- I thought Anesthesia was coming down.
- I paged. Apparently, he's at a pain clinic.

20:27.196 --> 20:29.818
- What's his pulse ox?
- Eighty-six and dropping.

20:30.408 --> 20:32.696
- How are you doing, Martin?
- Not so good.

20:32.868 --> 20:36.368
Let's up his inspiratory pressure at 15
and give him 5 of albuterol.

20:36.539 --> 20:40.122
I'll be back with an anesthesiologist
if I have to pull one out myself.

20:40.293 --> 20:42.120
Heart rate's down to 58.

20:42.295 --> 20:44.750
Come on, you got a kid who needs you.
Push the drugs.

20:44.922 --> 20:47.709
- Start the scan.
- Need to get your hands out of there.

20:47.883 --> 20:49.592
Atropine's in.

20:49.761 --> 20:51.469
Go.

20:51.638 --> 20:54.389
- How long is this gonna take?
- Twenty seconds, tops.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.633
I thought this was
a third-generation scanner.

20:56.809 --> 20:58.351
Another 10 seconds.

20:58.519 --> 21:00.346
What in God's name are you doing?

21:00.521 --> 21:04.140
Keeping this guy alive so we can get
the CT and show you where to cut.

21:04.317 --> 21:07.402
- Systolic's down to 90.
- Come on. Have we got soup yet?

21:08.405 --> 21:10.563
There. Eight-centimeter Triple-A.

21:12.283 --> 21:15.487
He would've bled out while I focused
on the liver and the spleen.

21:15.662 --> 21:17.655
It's all in the wrist.

21:18.248 --> 21:20.324
Dr. Carter? My patient's
in respiratory failure.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.291
No.

21:23.962 --> 21:26.250
Dr. Carter is not in here.

21:26.924 --> 21:29.213
- Sats are 82.
- I can't find Dr. Kovac either.

21:29.385 --> 21:31.710
- Martin, stay with us.
- What the hell's going on?

21:31.887 --> 21:35.671
- Progressive hypoxia despite inspiratory-
- Meaning he's not breathing. Bag him.

21:35.849 --> 21:38.007
- Bradying down to 52.
- Carter call Anesthesia?

21:38.184 --> 21:40.392
- An hour ago.
- Forget them coming to the rescue.

21:40.563 --> 21:42.970
Mig of atropine. Twenty of etomidate.
120 of sux.

21:43.148 --> 21:45.437
- We're supposed to wait.
- Lost the pulse.

21:46.110 --> 21:47.936
No, can't wait anymore.

21:48.111 --> 21:50.270
- Amp of epi.
- What are you doing?

21:50.447 --> 21:53.283
- He needs oxygen.
- Sats are dropping. Seventy-four.

21:53.451 --> 21:56.950
- Is the stiffness part of his disease?
- Pull his arms down, 100 of lido.

21:59.748 --> 22:01.408
I can't visualize squat.

22:01.583 --> 22:03.243
Dr. Pratt, are you sure?

22:03.418 --> 22:05.293
- Lido onboard.
- Stop compressions.

22:06.422 --> 22:08.794
- Pratt.
- I think I got it.

22:12.261 --> 22:13.885
Oh, God.

22:23.147 --> 22:26.730
- Hook up the ambu-bag.
- Pulse is strong and regular.

22:33.241 --> 22:34.439
Did he break his neck?

22:44.961 --> 22:47.001
Sats are good, 98 with 5 of PEEP.

22:47.172 --> 22:49.663
There's still no motor tone in the legs.

22:49.841 --> 22:52.047
It's probably the intubation meds.

22:53.261 --> 22:55.219
Sux only paralyzes for 10 minutes.

22:56.098 --> 22:57.758
Could be a slow metabolizer.

22:59.351 --> 23:03.099
- I just broke off a bone bridge, that's all.
- No withdrawal to pain.

23:03.271 --> 23:06.272
Well, even if his neck is broken,
doesn't mean he's paralyzed.

23:07.400 --> 23:11.813
Hang the steroids. And we'll take him
up to MRI. We'll know for sure.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.722
It's okay, baby.

23:28.899 --> 23:31.901
Mrs. Webster, you have to
get back in bed before you get hurt.

23:32.070 --> 23:33.943
I know you're busy.

23:34.113 --> 23:37.233
Severa, can we get her some
soft restraints for her protection?

23:37.408 --> 23:41.240
- Yes, doctor.
- But Mama still loves you.

23:50.713 --> 23:52.670
- Hey, you're back.
- Not quite.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.667
- Go wait in the lounge.
- Hi, Chuny.

23:54.842 --> 23:57.630
- Hey, Alex.
- Mommy dearest, Nursing director called.

23:57.804 --> 24:00.093
You're one emergency break away
from probation.

24:00.265 --> 24:03.100
- Perfect.
- Everything okay with Alex?

24:04.394 --> 24:06.884
- No school today?
- Nope. Excuse me.

24:07.063 --> 24:08.605
Dr. Carter?

24:08.773 --> 24:12.356
- Start with 25 of meclizine. Yep?
- I know we just met, but...

24:12.527 --> 24:15.647
- ... I wondered if you could do me a favor.
- Yeah.

24:16.990 --> 24:20.608
35-year-old female with AIDS-related
lymphoma, shortness of breath...

24:20.785 --> 24:23.621
- ... and hypotension.
- HIV status was diagnosed but untreated.

24:23.789 --> 24:25.366
- Hospice care?
- Lives alone at home.

24:25.540 --> 24:28.162
- How long have you had AIDS, ma'am?
- Too long.

24:28.335 --> 24:29.533
One, two, three.

24:30.337 --> 24:31.581
Any advanced directive?

24:31.755 --> 24:34.589
- Hypotensive, 78/52.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

24:34.757 --> 24:37.629
I guess someone bought into the idea
Morris was really sick.

24:37.803 --> 24:40.554
A hundred percent 02
and mix up dobutamine.

24:40.722 --> 24:42.715
- Who's your doctor, Ruthie?
- Don't have one.

24:42.891 --> 24:46.591
EKG, ABG and a portable chest.
Sorry about this morning, man.

24:46.770 --> 24:48.099
You didn't look too sorry.

24:48.272 --> 24:50.679
Lungs are wet and there's a harsh
systolic murmur.

24:50.858 --> 24:54.191
- Could never get an appointment.
- Aortic stenosis?

24:54.361 --> 24:57.148
More like mitral regurge.
We need an echo ASAP.

24:57.322 --> 24:58.947
Got it.

24:59.115 --> 25:02.201
- How's Val getting to the airport?
- Cab.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.327
We'll take care of you, Ruthie, okay?

25:04.830 --> 25:07.036
I can't believe he sutured himself.

25:07.207 --> 25:11.075
Edges are everted.
Nice wound approximation.

25:11.545 --> 25:14.333
- Hurt much when you did it?
- I numbed it with an ice cube.

25:15.591 --> 25:18.082
- That was good thinking.
- Don't encourage him.

25:18.260 --> 25:21.427
I'm gonna put in another stitch
just to be on the safe side.

25:21.680 --> 25:25.512
And I think you'll find that lidocaine
works much better than ice cubes.

25:25.935 --> 25:28.722
- I didn't have any.
- Sutures stay in for about seven days.

25:28.896 --> 25:31.221
And then I'm sure Mom
can take them out for you.

25:31.399 --> 25:34.684
- I can do it.
- I don't think so.

25:36.278 --> 25:38.604
- I appreciate your doing this.
- No problem.

25:38.782 --> 25:42.565
You ever seen a kid do something
this crazy before?

25:42.744 --> 25:44.653
To be honest...

25:48.082 --> 25:50.324
Pressure's up to 100.
Try a nitro spray.

25:50.501 --> 25:52.411
- She's a grown woman.
- We work together.

25:52.587 --> 25:55.790
Some respect would've been nice.
No acute ST changes.

25:55.965 --> 25:58.752
Some respect for the fact that we're
consenting adults would be nice.

25:58.927 --> 26:01.417
Hey, enough. Take it outside.

26:06.226 --> 26:08.302
Just when it was getting good.

26:08.478 --> 26:12.807
- It's not like I don't want her to date.
- You just don't want her to date me.

26:12.982 --> 26:17.028
- Look, man, this is not personal.
- You thinking I'm not good enough isn't?

26:17.196 --> 26:19.318
I got news for you, Mike.
It's not your call.

26:19.489 --> 26:21.399
I give up.

26:21.575 --> 26:23.816
- You barely know her.
- Yeah, no thanks to you.

26:23.994 --> 26:26.745
MRI called. They finished
with the neck-fracture guy.

26:29.917 --> 26:33.416
Ruthie, it appears as though
you have a tumor in your heart.

26:33.587 --> 26:35.959
It's gonna require a surgery.

26:36.131 --> 26:37.542
Why?

26:38.467 --> 26:42.631
Because the tumor will eventually
make it impossible for your heart-

26:42.805 --> 26:46.221
That'll keep me in the hospital,
what, a month?

26:46.892 --> 26:52.017
- Maybe longer.
- Now you wanna spend money on me.

26:52.981 --> 26:57.193
- Ruthie-
- Just save it for the next patient.

26:57.361 --> 26:59.401
Too late for this one.

27:03.283 --> 27:07.363
Okay, how about a little
cramping and dizziness to ease back in?

27:07.538 --> 27:10.990
- I thought you weren't on until 4.
- I'm not. But since I couldn't sleep...

27:11.167 --> 27:13.243
...I figured I'd make myself useful.

27:13.419 --> 27:14.699
Hey...

27:14.879 --> 27:17.037
...do you know much about
our insurance policy?

27:17.214 --> 27:19.123
Does it cover...

27:19.299 --> 27:20.498
...therapy?

27:20.677 --> 27:22.800
Physical or psychological?

27:22.971 --> 27:27.217
Like couples or family counseling.
You know, nothing serious.

27:27.391 --> 27:30.428
I think it's 80 percent,
but there's a max per year.

27:30.603 --> 27:32.061
Excuse me.

27:32.688 --> 27:34.017
Hey.

27:35.483 --> 27:38.235
- Can you tell me where I can find-?
- Hey, Valerie.

27:38.403 --> 27:40.894
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for you.

27:41.072 --> 27:43.064
Yeah, right. Have you seen
Pratt anywhere?

27:43.241 --> 27:45.067
He's up in MRI.
You want me to call him?

27:46.369 --> 27:48.907
- I thought your plane left at 2.
- It does.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.536
You come all the way down to see him
before you leave?

27:51.708 --> 27:54.412
- It's gonna take an hour just-
- I came to see you, Mike.

27:54.586 --> 27:57.622
I didn't wanna leave things this way.

27:57.797 --> 27:59.874
For real?

28:00.050 --> 28:03.501
You're my brother.
That's gotta come first.

28:03.929 --> 28:08.306
- I'll be more considerate next time, okay?
- Yeah.

28:10.101 --> 28:13.934
- Need me to get you a cab?
- No, I got one waiting.

28:14.106 --> 28:17.640
- I'll call you when I get in?
- Okay.

28:20.904 --> 28:25.566
- Don't be so serious all the time.
- Have a safe flight.

28:26.493 --> 28:30.705
- Cord edema and contusion at C-5.
- That can resolve with decompression.

28:30.872 --> 28:34.490
Not with this degree of hemorrhage.
Kid thought he had it bad before.

28:34.668 --> 28:37.242
Broke it in an MVA, right?

28:40.508 --> 28:44.339
Pratt, Mr. Brodie's in recovery.
I've repaired his abdominal aneurysm.

28:44.511 --> 28:47.429
And he's gonna be just fine.
How's his son doing?

28:47.597 --> 28:52.094
- You don't wanna know.
- I do. His father's asking about it.

28:52.270 --> 28:55.223
Complete cervical-cord injury
with quadriplegia.

28:57.274 --> 28:59.314
His neck snapped during an intubation.

28:59.485 --> 29:00.860
Performed by whom?

29:02.196 --> 29:03.477
Me.

29:04.490 --> 29:06.068
I'm sorry.

29:06.450 --> 29:08.657
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:16.336 --> 29:17.794
Hey.

29:23.509 --> 29:24.707
Hey! Taxi!

29:25.678 --> 29:26.958
Hey!

29:27.139 --> 29:29.048
Taxi! Hey.

29:30.058 --> 29:32.097
Greg? Unlock the door.

29:32.268 --> 29:35.851
Hey, if I'd known you were coming,
I would've stayed downstairs.

29:36.022 --> 29:38.857
Come on. Let me help you out.

29:41.153 --> 29:45.779
- You all right?
- Yeah. It's just a rough day, that's all.

29:45.949 --> 29:47.657
You know, it's been good with you.

29:48.660 --> 29:52.528
- Very good.
- Yeah, it has.

29:52.706 --> 29:56.241
Look, I got four days off next week.
How about I come out to D.C.?

29:56.418 --> 29:59.538
- We hang out, have a good time.
- That's sweet.

29:59.713 --> 30:03.841
- I'm serious.
- I'm sure you are, but...

30:04.008 --> 30:05.551
But what?

30:06.512 --> 30:07.792
Greg...

30:07.971 --> 30:10.379
...it's been fun, you know, a total blast.

30:10.557 --> 30:12.016
But...

30:12.184 --> 30:15.683
...this has been like being on vacation
for me, you know?

30:15.854 --> 30:17.312
What?

30:28.867 --> 30:30.695
Bye, baby.

30:42.297 --> 30:44.871
I thought he needed to be reminded.

30:47.011 --> 30:50.629
- No chips?
- Carrot sticks are better for you.

30:50.806 --> 30:54.720
- I got this. Thanks.
- Yeah. Look, he told me what he did.

30:54.893 --> 30:56.519
Really?

30:57.522 --> 31:01.140
I just wanted you to know
that I didn't show him how.

31:01.984 --> 31:04.736
I know. I did.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.359
Didn't think he'd ever try it.

31:07.907 --> 31:10.149
I guess that wasn't such a good idea.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.777
I'm trying to call Sharon,
see if she'll babysit...

31:14.956 --> 31:16.865
...but I haven't heard from her yet.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.249
Okay.

31:20.294 --> 31:21.754
Eat.

31:25.175 --> 31:29.635
- She's, like, wigging out over nothing.
- Hey, just do as your mother says, okay?

31:40.148 --> 31:43.184
- Did he seem okay to you?
- Yeah. Why?

31:43.818 --> 31:48.280
It's just really hard doing it all
by yourself, you know? I mean, I try.

31:48.449 --> 31:51.782
- You're doing great.
- Everyone says my kid's a freak.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.612
People talk. So what?

31:53.787 --> 31:56.704
I stuck tweezers into an electrical socket
when I was his age.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.330
- And I knew better.
- Then why did you do it?

31:59.502 --> 32:02.787
Because I was a kid.
Kids do stupid things sometimes.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.004
- You think maybe he needs-?
- Hey, he'll be fine.

32:15.559 --> 32:18.975
- Severa, where's Mrs. Webster?
- Who?

32:19.146 --> 32:21.767
Older black woman, wanderer.
She finally go up to Cards?

32:21.940 --> 32:24.431
Had to park her in the hall.
Morgue hasn't come yet.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.896
- Didn't think she was your patient.
- She wasn't.

32:42.587 --> 32:44.378
Damn.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.555
16-year-old male, multiple GSW
to the chest and abdomen.

32:58.728 --> 33:01.397
- Lost his pulse en route.
- Is he a gang kid?

33:01.564 --> 33:06.107
Whatever happened to playing cops and
robbers? Two dead, another on the way.

33:06.277 --> 33:07.392
Open up!

33:08.488 --> 33:11.109
- Trauma 2's clear.
- Hey, I got another one behind me.

33:11.282 --> 33:14.199
Come on, Sheila, Lester, go with Carter.
Neela, stay with me.

33:14.368 --> 33:15.994
- Where do I go?
- They need hands in 2.

33:16.163 --> 33:19.366
9- year-old caught in the crossfire.
Shotgun wound, pressure steady...

33:19.541 --> 33:22.660
- ... 92/64 after a liter.
- Sam, prime the rapid infuser.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.460
- What's your name, big guy?
- David.

33:24.629 --> 33:28.295
Don't be scared, David.
Dr. Kovac is one of the best here.

33:55.411 --> 33:56.953
Martin.

34:03.418 --> 34:05.245
Your dad's gonna be okay.

34:08.966 --> 34:12.132
I need to talk to you
about your intubation.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.087
There was...

34:18.100 --> 34:21.967
...a problem involving
your spinal cord.

34:26.275 --> 34:29.810
And it seems as though
you're gonna be paralyzed.

34:49.716 --> 34:52.170
- V-tach.
- All right, shock him once before we cut.

34:52.342 --> 34:56.007
Two hundred. This guy's got an entrance
wound for every two years of his life.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.055
Missed one in the right axilla.

34:58.225 --> 35:00.301
- Charged.
- Clear.

35:00.477 --> 35:02.185
- It's no change.
- Give me a 10 blade.

35:02.353 --> 35:03.848
Two units of O-neg infusing.

35:04.022 --> 35:05.432
Suction.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.963
Rib spreader.

35:14.055 --> 35:16.381
All right, everybody. Watch your feet.

35:18.351 --> 35:20.924
All right, four units of O-neg,
then type-specific.

35:21.104 --> 35:23.228
Come around here
and do internal compressions.

35:23.399 --> 35:27.610
The most survivable lesion is myocardial
penetration with tamponade.

35:28.445 --> 35:31.066
- Heart's empty.
- All right, Satinsky.

35:31.239 --> 35:32.568
You want FFP too?

35:32.824 --> 35:36.075
- Why FFP?
- If you get a dilutional coagulopathy...

35:36.245 --> 35:37.953
...after five units.

35:40.582 --> 35:43.334
- Aorta is cross-clamped.
- Big hole in the left ventricle.

35:43.502 --> 35:46.788
- Let's plug it with a Foley, 30 cc balloon.
- That'll work?

35:46.964 --> 35:51.044
- Paramedics said he had a pulse.
- It's worth a try.

35:51.218 --> 35:53.839
Fifty mics of fent. He's out.

35:54.013 --> 35:56.717
Vascular's in the O.R. with a fem-pop.
It'll be a while.

35:56.890 --> 35:58.384
He doesn't have a while.

35:58.558 --> 36:01.477
The longer we wait,
the greater loss of arm function.

36:01.646 --> 36:03.472
- Get me a vascular clamp.
- From where?

36:03.648 --> 36:05.640
Thoracotomy kit.

36:06.150 --> 36:08.937
Neela, I'm rolling back with pressure.

36:09.611 --> 36:14.321
When you see the end of the artery,
press down hard with your finger.

36:14.492 --> 36:18.157
- Have an 0-silk stitch ready on a driver.
- Wound's down through the biceps.

36:18.329 --> 36:19.574
I see humerus.

36:19.747 --> 36:23.163
- Can a vascular clamp repair that?
- It's our best shot.

36:23.334 --> 36:25.956
If the arm is ischemic too long,
we'll have to amputate.

36:26.129 --> 36:28.121
All right, hold compressions.

36:28.298 --> 36:30.124
- V-fib.
- Charge to 30.

36:30.300 --> 36:33.051
- You gotta let go of the Foley.
- No, no. It won't conduct.

36:35.471 --> 36:36.751
Still fib. Shock again?

36:36.931 --> 36:38.675
No. Resume compressions.

36:38.850 --> 36:40.759
Hold this. And give me a 10 blade.

36:40.935 --> 36:44.850
Heart won't respond to defibrillation
until you've restored volume until it's full.

36:45.023 --> 36:48.937
- So, what are you doing now?
- It's called a clamshell incision.

36:49.110 --> 36:52.065
- He must be bleeding in the right chest.
- Six units in so far.

36:52.239 --> 36:53.899
Keep them coming.

36:54.616 --> 36:56.739
- Got it.
- Clamp.

37:02.623 --> 37:05.376
Push me the pad and get me
some IV tubing.

37:06.336 --> 37:08.625
I'll tie the proximal end,
you do the distal.

37:11.049 --> 37:14.714
- Purse-string it with 0 silk.
- That gonna hold a high-pressure artery?

37:14.886 --> 37:17.971
Just a bridge until Vascular can do
a real repair.

37:18.140 --> 37:21.675
- And this won't clot off?
- By then he will be in the O.R.

37:29.485 --> 37:31.477
Releasing proximally.

37:38.118 --> 37:39.696
A little oozing.

37:41.205 --> 37:45.072
- Nails are pinking up.
- Palpable radial-ulnar pulse.

37:46.127 --> 37:47.585
Didn't think you could do that.

37:51.590 --> 37:53.998
- Fine V-fib.
- Been five minutes since the last epi.

37:54.177 --> 37:55.920
Okay, push another amp.

37:56.095 --> 37:57.424
Clear.

37:59.432 --> 38:02.053
- Asystole.
- All right, another mig of atropine.

38:02.226 --> 38:04.017
- Is the heart filling?
- Yeah.

38:04.186 --> 38:07.770
After eight units, packed cells,
two FFP and a ton of platelets.

38:11.611 --> 38:13.105
Okay, that's it.

38:15.990 --> 38:18.991
- Pretty big mess.
- Can't say we didn't try.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.734
I'll get Housekeeping on it.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.078
I'm glad you went back.

38:32.716 --> 38:34.589
To med school?

38:35.802 --> 38:37.545
Yeah. Me too.

38:37.721 --> 38:39.464
You never should have left.

38:39.639 --> 38:40.919
Well...

38:41.099 --> 38:43.803
...timing is everything, right?

38:46.855 --> 38:47.934
What?

38:50.317 --> 38:52.642
- Nothing.
- What?

38:55.864 --> 38:57.144
You seem happy.

38:58.909 --> 39:00.154
Right back at you.

39:02.162 --> 39:03.953
So we're okay?

39:07.334 --> 39:08.532
We're okay.

39:10.171 --> 39:14.002
Good. Because Kem and I,
we're gonna go get some dinner later.

39:14.174 --> 39:15.834
Wanna come with us?

39:17.177 --> 39:18.636
Well...

39:18.804 --> 39:20.512
...I'm not that okay.

39:21.848 --> 39:23.676
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

39:29.857 --> 39:31.849
Ready to go?

39:35.738 --> 39:37.113
Alex.

39:37.698 --> 39:40.189
Come on. It's time to go home.

39:45.205 --> 39:49.074
You can bring your car around.
I can help you carry him.

39:49.627 --> 39:51.371
He's pretty out of it.

40:03.725 --> 40:09.478
- You should have waited in the car.
- I haven't seen snow since I was a kid.

40:11.315 --> 40:13.605
- Did you arrange for it?
- Yeah.

40:13.777 --> 40:18.604
- Think it's too much?
- I think it's damn cold.

40:21.159 --> 40:25.452
- God, it's a good thing I love you.
- You want me to stop?

40:26.123 --> 40:27.866
Not necessarily.

40:39.636 --> 40:41.629
- We should go.
- Put him in the back seat.

40:45.559 --> 40:48.228
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:00.449 --> 41:03.283
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

41:04.412 --> 41:06.618
- You off now?
- Yep.

41:07.581 --> 41:08.779
You need a lift?

41:11.085 --> 41:13.077
I have something to take care of first.

41:14.046 --> 41:15.670
Okay.

41:29.771 --> 41:32.724
- What are you doing?
- Need to fix my resignation letter.

41:33.482 --> 41:36.234
- So you broke into my office?
- The door was open.

41:36.402 --> 41:39.605
- I'm changing the date on my last shift.
- Let me guess. Sooner?

41:39.780 --> 41:41.322
Actually, later.

41:42.157 --> 41:43.818
You wanna be a little more specific?

41:45.161 --> 41:46.739
No.

41:46.913 --> 41:49.748
- Not right now, anyway.
- Well, let me know when you decide.

41:49.916 --> 41:51.789
See you tomorrow, Kerry.

41:52.418 --> 41:53.663
Stay out of my inbox.

41:57.090 --> 41:58.667
You'll have another?

41:59.676 --> 42:01.502
Bring it on.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.511
Come by to give me some more?

42:08.185 --> 42:10.722
- Hey, I'll take one of those.
- You got it.

42:11.438 --> 42:14.011
To tell you the truth,
I'm really not in the mood.

42:14.858 --> 42:18.522
Yeah, I heard about that neck thing.
That's some hard stuff, man.

42:22.866 --> 42:27.575
Look, we got a big family, okay?
Lots of boys. Val's the only girl.

42:27.746 --> 42:30.949
So we all tend to be a bit
overprotective.

42:31.124 --> 42:34.541
I ever tell you my mom died
when I was 12?

42:35.337 --> 42:37.211
No, you didn't.

42:37.547 --> 42:40.382
That's some hard-ass stuff right there.

42:40.550 --> 42:43.421
You have to get used to being by yourself
when that happens.

42:44.929 --> 42:46.508
What about your father?

42:47.600 --> 42:49.142
The truth is...

42:49.310 --> 42:51.302
...all anybody's got is themselves.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.516
I'm not sure I agree with that.

42:56.066 --> 42:57.394
Look...

42:57.567 --> 43:00.818
...just say what you have to say
and leave me at peace, okay?

43:04.700 --> 43:07.155
- My sister-
- Played me.

43:08.287 --> 43:10.113
She played me.

43:12.667 --> 43:15.122
Well, you can't say I didn't warn you.

43:15.628 --> 43:17.916
So you were protecting me, huh?

43:18.839 --> 43:21.211
Look, anyway, I'm sorry.

43:21.383 --> 43:22.961
No worries.

43:23.135 --> 43:24.595
Okay, then.

43:24.762 --> 43:26.387
Have a good night.

43:28.266 --> 43:29.890
No, leave it.

43:30.059 --> 43:31.850
I'll drink it.
