WEBVTT

00:10.844 --> 00:13.555
[Daniel] I know it's been a while
since our last class.

00:14.305 --> 00:18.184
After the fight at the school,
I wasn't sure Miyagi-Do should stay open.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.063
But things have gotten worse
since we shut down.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.898
That's why we're back.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.443
The only way to stop Cobra Kai

00:26.526 --> 00:28.611
is if we all work together.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.113
But always remember,

00:30.196 --> 00:32.991
the reason we learn karate is--

00:33.074 --> 00:36.661
To show the world that
you're not a bunch of pansy-ass nerds!

00:37.328 --> 00:39.581
We're gonna show 'em that you're tough!

00:40.582 --> 00:42.625
Because eagles don't get shit on.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.629
-They're the ones that do the shitting.
-[chuckles]

00:46.713 --> 00:50.425
Just don't forget, being a badass
doesn't mean being an asshole.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.428
The goal isn't to hurt other kids.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.389
The goal is to--

00:56.473 --> 00:58.058
[Kreese] Win at all costs.

00:58.808 --> 01:02.187
Those we thought to be our allies
have turned against us.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.524
Now our enemies are attacking us
from all sides.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.069
There is no turning back.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.280
Now is the time to show them--

01:12.363 --> 01:13.573
Forgiveness.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.241
Compassion.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.162
Mr. Miyagi used to say
if you're looking for revenge,

01:19.245 --> 01:21.831
you could start by digging two graves.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.957
He was right.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.920
If you have hate in your heart,
then you've already lost.

01:28.046 --> 01:31.758
I know it's not easy,
but you have to do whatever you can--

01:31.841 --> 01:34.552
-To beat the living crap out of 'em.
-[kids exhale sharply]

01:34.636 --> 01:36.262
Don't let 'em push you around.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.265
You gotta swoop down like an eagle,

01:40.475 --> 01:43.478
grab 'em with your claws,
and sink your fangs into 'em.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.690
But I don't ever want you
to start the fight.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.820
-I just want you to--
-Finish it.

01:53.696 --> 01:54.906
For good.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.202
Do I make myself clear?

01:59.285 --> 02:00.745
[all] Yes, Sensei.

02:10.338 --> 02:11.422
[buzzer sounds]

02:14.175 --> 02:17.679
It's locked. They'll buzz it open
when he's on his way out.

02:17.762 --> 02:20.974
-You gotta be kidding, they called you?
-I called them.

02:21.057 --> 02:24.477
With Shannon still in rehab, I wanted
someone here to pick him up.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.687
I'm here, aren't I?

02:25.770 --> 02:28.690
I'm not looking for any trouble.
I'm just here for Robby.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.276
Robby doesn't need you.
You've done enough.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.779
-Thank you. Bye.
-You got it all under control?

02:34.863 --> 02:38.158
-Yeah, I do.
-Just like you had Kreese under control?

02:38.241 --> 02:41.494
What did you think would happen
summoning that devil back to Earth?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.621
-Kreese is my problem.
-Not anymore.

02:43.705 --> 02:46.541
He's made it crystal clear
that he is everyone's problem.

02:46.624 --> 02:50.170
As usual, I'll have to be the one
that's gonna clean up your mess.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.629
I clean up my own messes.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.299
I'm dealing with it.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.802
How exactly are you dealing with it?
Gonna barge in and beat him up?

02:57.886 --> 03:00.930
-Worked out great at the chop shop.
-Those guys deserved it.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.267
That's your problem. Your whole life
you've been striking first.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.103
You never once considered
maybe you should think first.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.315
-Know what I'm thinking now?
-Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.567
[Robby] Seriously?

03:14.819 --> 03:16.613
-Robby.
-Hey, Robby.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.948
I told you I don't want you here.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.076
-You're my son. I wanted to be here.
-And so did I.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.162
It's your fault I was in here.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.040
I know you're upset.
I was doing what was best for you.

03:27.707 --> 03:31.669
I just want you to know I'm here.
You always have a home at Miyagi-Do.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.171
Or with me.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.464
Both of you…

03:35.256 --> 03:36.549
stay out of my life.

03:37.926 --> 03:38.927
Robby…

03:40.386 --> 03:41.262
Robby…

03:41.346 --> 03:43.348
[melancholic music playing]

04:00.114 --> 04:01.908
-Oh, sorry, I--
-I'm sorry, Sam.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.202
I should've been watching
where I was going.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.537
-Me too.
-[Sam chuckles nervously]

04:07.622 --> 04:11.000
So, uh, congratulations
on being back on your feet! [chuckles]

04:11.084 --> 04:12.085
Literally.

04:13.544 --> 04:14.379
Thanks.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.882
I'll let you get back to your friends.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.510
They're not my friends anymore.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.097
Not after what they did to you guys.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.063
-I should probably get to study hall.
-I'm actually headed that way too.

04:33.022 --> 04:33.856
OK.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.697
So, you think enough time has passed
for us to be friends again?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.031
Or start over?

04:43.241 --> 04:45.410
Hi. I'm Sam. Nice to meet you.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.911
Miguel. It's a pleasure.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.122
Yasmine?

04:50.665 --> 04:52.250
Hey. Um...

04:52.333 --> 04:53.543
We were just, uh…

04:54.836 --> 04:56.796
-[exhales heavily]
-Doing study work.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.964
Yup.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.216
So you two are…

05:00.300 --> 05:01.634
What? [chuckles]

05:02.343 --> 05:04.470
Ew. Ew! No.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.973
Like I would ever date this freak.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.105
Whatever, Cruella. Why don't you
go kill a bunch of dalmatians?

05:15.231 --> 05:17.191
I am 101% in love!

05:18.484 --> 05:20.069
-[Demetri sighs]
-[Sam chuckles]

05:20.820 --> 05:22.363
I can't believe that just happened!

05:22.447 --> 05:23.781
Yeah, I guess, uh…

05:25.366 --> 05:26.617
love conquers all.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.329
I guess it does.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.123
[Sam chuckles]

05:32.206 --> 05:34.459
[Daniel] OK, let's do it again
from the top.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.210
Keep going. Let's go.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.380
Come on, Chris. You know these moves.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.299
Sorry, I'm just trying to keep up.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.596
Did you like having your arm broken?

05:46.679 --> 05:50.600
Because if you defend like that,
you'll be right back in that cast.

05:50.683 --> 05:54.645
Uh, OK, guys, let's, uh…
Let's take five. Yeah?

05:54.729 --> 05:56.939
There's iced tea and lemonade inside.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.776
-[student 1] Oh, man.
-[student 2] I'm just so tired.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.985
That was brutal.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.948
Take it easy. It's their first week back.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.825
They should know this stuff by now.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.745
It's my fault they're in this position.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.663
One day, they may find themselves alone

06:12.747 --> 06:15.291
and they'll need
these techniques to survive.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.587
OK, so this is about Robby, right?

06:22.548 --> 06:25.593
Look, Daniel,
you need to let him figure it out.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.889
If he wants to come back,
the door's always open, but…

06:30.807 --> 06:31.808
if he doesn't,

06:32.809 --> 06:34.477
you're gonna have to let him go.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.354
I can't just let him go.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.314
He has no one!

06:39.315 --> 06:41.567
Wow! Would you look at this?

06:41.651 --> 06:43.069
[Daniel] Hey, Ron.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.446
Why are we holding board meetings
at the rec center

06:45.530 --> 06:47.657
when you have
the Enchanted Tiki Room here?

06:48.783 --> 06:49.909
Are those real koi?

06:50.868 --> 06:51.828
[Daniel] What's up?

06:51.911 --> 06:55.790
The All Valley is still months away.
Is there a problem with the committee?

06:56.290 --> 06:58.626
There's a problem
with the whole tournament.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.004
-[grunts]
-[Johnny] Good, Bert.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.174
Remind me not to piss you off.
Assface, you're next.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.552
Does my nickname gotta carry over
from the previous dojo?

07:07.635 --> 07:08.970
You wanna be Penis Breath?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.097
Assface is fine.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.309
Good, Penis Breath!

07:15.393 --> 07:17.019
All right. Diaz, you're up.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.775
Imagine this is the guy
I stole this Frisbee from.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.777
Just picture his stupid white dreads.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.322
[breathes deeply]

07:29.407 --> 07:32.034
-[grunts weakly]
-Good hustle. Who's next?

07:32.118 --> 07:34.537
-No, I can do it, Sensei.
-Miguel, it's fine.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.621
I got it.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.418
All right. Get in a side stance.
Use the balls of your feet.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.382
-[groans]
-Miguel!

07:47.258 --> 07:49.594
-[student] You good?
-I'm fine. I'm fine!

07:51.262 --> 07:53.764
All right, everybody.
Take five, go get some water.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.727
But not from the fountain,
I saw some meth head wipe his ass in it.

08:01.522 --> 08:05.276
It's OK if you can't do the things
you could before. Nobody expects you to.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.820
-[cell phone chimes]
-Gotta be shitting me!

08:08.988 --> 08:11.574
-What? What happened?
-They canceled the All Valley.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.452
-They did what?
-[Ron] They canceled it.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.579
City council just pulled the permit.

08:16.662 --> 08:21.042
Something about not wanting
to foster a culture of violence

08:21.125 --> 08:23.753
after the whole fracas at the school.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.422
It's an over-correction, if you ask me.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.886
We even had State Farm
on board as a sponsor.

08:31.969 --> 08:35.765
[sighs] Now I gotta call my agent Taylor
and break the bad news.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.058
So, that's it then?

08:37.141 --> 08:40.728
They cast karate as the villain
without any context whatsoever,

08:40.811 --> 08:42.688
and we can't do anything about it?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.232
There's a community hearing.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.569
It's pretty much a formality, but the way
the All Valley Committee feels,

08:48.653 --> 08:52.406
if there's one person that can convince
the city to overturn their decision,

08:53.074 --> 08:54.492
it's the two-time champ.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.286
[sentimental music playing]

08:57.995 --> 09:00.957
All right. Well, I gotta go talk
to the rest of the board.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.792
Mmm!

09:02.875 --> 09:05.586
That was good.
Did you grow your own lemons or…

09:06.170 --> 09:07.421
It's Crystal Light.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.840
-Delightful.
-Look what you did there.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.138
-So what are you gonna do?
-I dunno.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.684
Maybe on some level,
this was for the best.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.272
Cobra Kai doesn't have a free stage
to put their violence on display.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.900
You're not going to let them
cancel the All Valley, are you?

09:27.984 --> 09:29.777
I don't know, Sam.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.196
Miyagi-Do got blamed
for what happened to Miguel.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.406
If it gets canceled,

09:33.489 --> 09:36.325
that sends a message to the whole Valley
that we're the bad guys.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.994
You can't let that happen.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.914
[Miguel] Tell them
what karate means to you.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.333
How you started Cobra Kai
to help kids like me,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.294
taught us to stand up for ourselves.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.464
-Maybe this is a blessing in disguise.
-What's that supposed to mean?

09:50.548 --> 09:53.968
-It's not like you were even gonna fight.
-Of course I was.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.848
Training with no contact is one thing,
I can't risk you getting hurt.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.975
It's not fair.
I'm working hard, getting better.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.477
-For your safety.
-I thought safety was for pussies?

10:03.561 --> 10:05.813
-This is different.
-You don't think I can do it!

10:05.896 --> 10:08.858
You almost hurt yourself
with one kick! One kick!

10:10.318 --> 10:12.069
What would happen in a real fight?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.571
[melancholic music plays]

10:14.697 --> 10:17.575
-You already proved you could win.
-I need to prove it again!

10:21.662 --> 10:23.623
You said you'd always be on my side.

10:25.916 --> 10:26.792
Miguel…

10:45.102 --> 10:47.188
Hey. I'm Robby Keene.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.273
Fill out this form.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.859
We'll call your name
when a probation officer's ready.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.040
[suspenseful music plays]

11:09.752 --> 11:12.922
Yeah, go ahead.
They'll send you straight back to juvie.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.180
We're in the same boat.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.016
-Thank to you starting the fight.
-And you finishing it.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.480
It's not fair, you know.

11:30.564 --> 11:35.403
Everyone else got to go back to normal,
but we're eating shit while your girlfri--

11:35.486 --> 11:37.363
-Don't talk about Sam.
-She cheated on you.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.573
She made a mistake. Sam is a good person.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.201
Yeah. She sure acts like it.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.080
Just wait, she'll turn on you.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.082
-Just like Miguel.
-You don't know that.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.625
Then why are we both here?

11:50.960 --> 11:55.339
At least I know who I am. You're still
pretending to be something you're not.

12:01.554 --> 12:05.891
On the section about home life,
just check off "stable."

12:06.976 --> 12:09.019
They don't care. They never come check.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.448
Hope the juice is all right.
Don't think it's expired yet.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.492
It's good. Thank you.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.161
You got it.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.708
I wanna let you know I appreciate
you putting Miguel's safety first.

12:30.791 --> 12:31.751
Yeah.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.545
Lot of good it did. Now he hates me.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.921
He's a teenager.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.717
If he's happy with you all the time,
you're doing something wrong.

12:40.968 --> 12:44.972
We both know being a parent means making
the hard choices for their own good.

12:45.055 --> 12:48.851
I just don't want to screw things up
with Miguel like I did with Robby.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.104
You've done so much for Miguel.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.900
You got him out of bed,
out of the wheelchair.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.360
You made him smile again.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.529
And he won't forget that.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.908
And neither will I.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.120
[sentimental music playing]

13:12.124 --> 13:13.626
I heard about the tournament.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.337
Yeah, who needs it anyway?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.714
You do.

13:20.674 --> 13:21.592
Believe me,

13:21.675 --> 13:25.137
a few months ago, I never wanted
to hear the word "karate" again.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.473
I thought that was the reason
Miguel got hurt.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.017
And I blamed you.

13:30.935 --> 13:31.769
I was so angry.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.481
You had a right to be.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.442
But it wasn't your fault.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.320
I see how much you care for Miguel,

13:42.196 --> 13:45.199
and I realize now
you were just as hurt as I was.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.540
I may not want him to compete,

13:54.208 --> 13:56.335
but I know he won't get hurt again.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.088
Because you're his sensei.

14:02.049 --> 14:06.053
It's what you were meant to be.
It's your strength, your calling.

14:06.929 --> 14:10.057
There are other Miguels out there
who need you in their corner.

14:11.308 --> 14:15.354
I know I'm the last person
you'd expect to be telling you this, but…

14:16.480 --> 14:18.399
you have to save the tournament.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.655
I don't know how I'm going to do it.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.367
By doing what you do best.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.370
Fight.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.714
Mr. Carter, please, we need to move on.

14:41.797 --> 14:46.552
And now I'm hearing the city wants
to rename manholes "maintenance covers."

14:46.635 --> 14:49.597
Do you know what we called a manhole
back in my day?

14:50.097 --> 14:51.390
A manhole.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.350
And that's just the start.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.560
[door opens]

14:54.643 --> 14:56.520
Don't worry, Dad. You got this.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.939
[Mr. Carter continues indistinctly]

15:06.071 --> 15:08.657
-What are you doing here?
-Fighting for All Valley.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.409
You? Gonna read from your diary?

15:10.492 --> 15:14.204
-Nothing wrong with being prepared.
-Yeah, and I don't need notes.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.497
I'll shoot from the hip.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.835
This is gonna be a disaster.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.128
[gavel banging]

15:21.211 --> 15:24.298
OK, next we will hear appeals

15:24.381 --> 15:28.302
for the cancellation of the All Valley
Under-18 Karate Tournament.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.596
Who would like to speak first?

15:30.679 --> 15:32.514
[dramatic music plays]

15:38.354 --> 15:42.358
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm retired Army Captain John Kreese.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.277
Thank you for your service.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.614
It was an honor to serve.

15:49.531 --> 15:52.368
And I continue to serve
right here in our community,

15:52.451 --> 15:54.995
by teaching our children strength

15:55.079 --> 15:58.082
and discipline through karate.

15:58.666 --> 16:02.711
I was devastated to hear
about the cancellation of the tournament

16:03.587 --> 16:05.464
because of the fight at the high school.

16:05.547 --> 16:09.843
Why are my students being penalized
because of the violence perpetrated by…

16:10.469 --> 16:12.471
dojos like Miyagi-Do?

16:12.554 --> 16:13.806
Now, wait just a minute.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.684
Mr. LaRusso, please.
It's not your turn to speak.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.436
I apologize, Councilwoman Roberts.
But this man--

16:19.520 --> 16:21.605
"Councilperson" Roberts.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.069
Thank you, Captain Kreese.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.238
Please, continue.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.116
I think my colleagues here would agree

16:32.199 --> 16:35.744
that all we want is the best
for our students and our community.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.581
Cobra Kai's goal is
to prepare the Valley's youth

16:40.666 --> 16:43.460
for the unfortunate realities
of the real world.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.004
It's hard out there.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.465
I'm simply just preparing them
to defend themselves.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.134
Councilperson Roberts, I'm sorry,

16:50.217 --> 16:52.720
but this guy is selling you
a bad bill of goods.

16:52.803 --> 16:56.890
Just a few weeks ago, my students
were injured by a bunch of his Cobra Kais

16:56.974 --> 16:59.101
in an abandoned recreation facility.

16:59.184 --> 17:03.564
Who started that fight? If memory serves,
your out-of-control daughter.

17:03.647 --> 17:07.067
Hey! You leave my daughter out of this,
you piece of shit!

17:07.151 --> 17:08.068
Mom!

17:08.152 --> 17:10.237
Ma'am, please restrain yourself.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.614
[Kreese] It's funny
that you say that, because…

17:13.115 --> 17:17.036
I've had to file a restraining order
against her for physically assaulting me.

17:17.119 --> 17:21.206
-[scoffs] Assault? Are you kidding me?
-Maybe I should call the authorities?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.791
That won't be necessary.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.587
-Ma'am.
-Hey, do not… Do not touch me! OK?

17:26.670 --> 17:28.380
I'm leaving. I'm leaving!

17:28.964 --> 17:30.841
OK? But that man is a lunatic!

17:32.760 --> 17:36.930
Councilperson Roberts, I assure you
that I am a positive influence

17:37.014 --> 17:40.559
to my students,
and the hundreds of students before them.

17:40.642 --> 17:41.560
Horseshit!

17:42.227 --> 17:44.688
Your Honor,
John Lawrence, Eagle Fang Karate.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.859
This man has poisoned the minds
of his students.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.321
And I should know, I was one of them.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.115
Were we competitive?

17:55.824 --> 17:56.784
Sure.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.786
But it was all for good sport.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.829
This man is a thief and a liar!

18:00.913 --> 18:04.041
-And he put a live cobra in my dealership!
-[gavel bangs]

18:04.124 --> 18:05.250
Enough!

18:05.834 --> 18:06.877
Sit down.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.213
All of you.

18:17.054 --> 18:21.350
It is clear this karate tournament
is causing division and rivalry

18:21.433 --> 18:22.476
in our community.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.269
You gentlemen…

18:25.312 --> 18:27.022
have made an excellent case today

18:27.106 --> 18:29.817
as to why this tournament
should not continue.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.861
[male voice] Wait!

18:32.945 --> 18:34.696
[audience members gasp]

18:37.699 --> 18:38.700
[woman] Who's that?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.254
My name is Miguel Diaz.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.840
I was in the school fight.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.759
I was the one kicked off the second floor.

18:57.845 --> 18:58.887
You know, uh…

19:00.055 --> 19:02.099
I thought I was gonna be paralyzed.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.684
I relearned how to stand.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.478
I relearned how to walk.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.315
And I want the tournament to continue.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.861
We are very happy
for your recovery, young man.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.281
-But I'm afraid you don't understand--
-Yes, he does.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.703
We're the ones getting hurt.
We're the ones fighting.

19:23.245 --> 19:28.000
Our voices should matter the most.
And we want a place where we can compete,

19:29.001 --> 19:30.294
fairly and safely.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.049
When I first moved here, I was bullied.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.219
I realized there's no escaping it.

19:39.761 --> 19:42.347
Some kid will always want
to steal your lunch money,

19:42.431 --> 19:44.349
give you a wedgie, or a swirlie.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
A swirlie?

19:45.767 --> 19:48.604
When you dunk someone's head
in the toilet and flush it.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.107
-Pretty funny, actually.
-[Miguel] Sensei!

19:55.569 --> 19:57.112
[breathes deeply]

19:57.738 --> 20:01.533
Instead of burying your heads in the sand,
pretending that bullying doesn't exist,

20:01.617 --> 20:03.327
or that you could get rid of it,

20:03.410 --> 20:05.829
you need to teach kids
how to defend themselves.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.915
Physically and mentally.

20:08.832 --> 20:13.170
Because sometimes the scars you can't see
are the ones that hurt the most.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.925
[Miguel] Karate is about discipline.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.219
It's about inner strength.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.720
It's about confidence.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.140
Lessons you can use
for the rest of your life.

20:26.350 --> 20:30.270
Look, I don't know where I would be today,
or who I would be today,

20:31.021 --> 20:32.648
if it wasn't for my sensei.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.990
We don't need this tournament
to do cool kicks or sell tickets,

20:43.200 --> 20:46.954
we need it to show the bullies
of the world that we're not afraid.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.040
It's called the "All Valley"
because it's for everyone,

20:50.540 --> 20:53.377
to give everyone the chance
to show what they can do,

20:53.460 --> 20:55.754
to fight, to become a champion.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.882
And we deserve that chance.

21:12.354 --> 21:16.191
To be honest, I don't get
the Valley's fascination with karate.

21:17.025 --> 21:17.943
But…

21:18.527 --> 21:21.029
if it means that much to all of you,

21:21.113 --> 21:24.908
and you're willing to sign waivers
stating that the city is not liable,

21:25.701 --> 21:26.702
then…

21:29.162 --> 21:33.750
the All Valley Under-18 Tournament
is officially back on.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.086

22:09.870 --> 22:12.831
-To the All Valley tournament.
-Right, yeah.

22:16.918 --> 22:19.921
This place is crazy. What's the rock say?

22:20.505 --> 22:23.884
I don't know. My dad won't tell me.
Or maybe he doesn't know.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.802
Well, it's a cool rock.

22:26.928 --> 22:30.891
All we have is vandalized park benches
and regular boring rocks.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.434
You're welcome to train here.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.021
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's a cool yard, but…

22:36.104 --> 22:37.981
do you guys actually do karate here?

22:38.774 --> 22:42.444
-It looks like breathing exercises!
-Oh, it's not badass enough for you?

22:42.527 --> 22:44.571
We train in junkyards and cement trucks!

22:44.654 --> 22:47.908
-And I've trained in that pond over there.
-Oh, a pond.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.660
Not everything in Miyagi-Do
is what it seems.

22:50.744 --> 22:51.745
Yeah, well, OK.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.332
OK!

with surprisingly little effort.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.425
Well, let's see you do it again.
Don't hold back.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.594
I wouldn't worry about it.

-OK.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.834
You get together the second I was gone
or wait a week to make it look good?

23:38.917 --> 23:40.460
It's not like that.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.214
Now I know why you stopped writing.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.049
I stopped because you never answered!

It's kinda hard
in between getting my face busted in!

23:49.094 --> 23:50.303
I didn't know.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.556
-You wouldn't have cared if you did.
-It's not her fault.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.975
-Stay out of this!
-I don't think I will.

No, come in. It's all right.

-Mm-mmm.

-I heard what happened at the meeting.
-Ah, you should've seen him.

Heart on his sleeve,
saying what needed to be said.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.662
He was a true champion.

24:58.622 --> 25:02.167
But I didn't say he could compete again.
I didn't know he'd be there.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.211
Believe me, I had nothing to do with that.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.171
Yes, you did.
